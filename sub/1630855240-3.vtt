20:43.285 --> 20:44.808
Where's Martin?

20:44.852 --> 20:47.289
- He's out for a few minutes,
had to put out some fires.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.464
Just sit here.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.813
- I really gotta go home.

20:49.857 --> 20:52.555
- Oh come on girl, you
can stay for a minute.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.209
Have a drink with me.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.254
- All right.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.820
[Howard laughs]

20:56.864 --> 20:59.301
- So, uh, Rusty is going
after that man of yours huh?

20:59.345 --> 21:01.216
Can't blame you.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.697
You enjoy while you young and
everything's still working?

21:03.740 --> 21:06.395
- Yeah, even though
he might not be there.

21:06.439 --> 21:10.530
- Uh-oh, things,
uh, rocky at home?

21:10.573 --> 21:12.532
- Let's just say Daryl
is having trouble

21:12.575 --> 21:15.448
finding his way home these days.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.840
That fucking phone.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.192
- You, uh, go through it.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.846
- I sure motherfucking did.

21:22.890 --> 21:23.717
- And?

21:25.719 --> 21:27.503
- No direct evidence,

21:27.547 --> 21:31.638
but a fair amount of
circumstantial evidence.

21:31.681 --> 21:32.900
- Enough to convict him?

21:34.771 --> 21:37.339
- Can't say beyond
a reasonable doubt.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.732
- Then that's that.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.516
- So I shouldn't be worried?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.344
I mean, you and I both
know guys like him.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.565
- You married a guy
like him. [laughs]

21:47.393 --> 21:50.309
Can't be mad, you got
exactly what you picked.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.529
- I'm just saying, I
just don't understand.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.271
Why can't I have
my own man, hmm?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.491
Why can't, why can't I,

21:59.579 --> 22:01.407
why can't I just be enough?

22:01.450 --> 22:03.365
I don't think that I'm ugly.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.715
I actually think that
I look good, right?

22:05.759 --> 22:07.500
- You do.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.719
- TMI, but I give
him all the sex

22:09.763 --> 22:11.808
that he asks for and good sex.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.419
I mean, I'm just saying.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.724
- [Graves] Hmm.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.204
But the thing is,
on top of that,

22:16.247 --> 22:18.249
I pay all of the bills [laughs]

22:18.293 --> 22:20.382
and that shit actually
works against me.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.470
- I hear you, sis.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.605
But there's the law
of supply and demand

22:25.648 --> 22:26.867
[Yvonne scoffs]

22:26.910 --> 22:28.912
and cats like that
are always in demand.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.785
They don't have to go
out looking for it,
it looks for them.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.222
[velvety music]

22:34.265 --> 22:37.399
[group of men laughing]

22:37.443 --> 22:39.575
- Hey nah, but for real man,
we gotta get you a lady.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.534
- I'm sick of y'all niggas.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.274
- What, a side?

22:43.318 --> 22:44.624
- Set it up then.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.408
- Oh!

22:46.452 --> 22:47.409
- What?

22:47.453 --> 22:48.497
- What's going on Jen?

22:48.541 --> 22:49.585
- Hey.

22:49.629 --> 22:50.847
- There she is.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.588
There she is.
- Looking good.

22:52.632 --> 22:53.676
There she is.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.677
- Thank you, how're you?

22:54.721 --> 22:56.418
Yo Drake, let's jump?

22:56.462 --> 22:57.941
No, definitely you
can have my seat too.

22:57.985 --> 23:00.291
- Hey D, tell Jay I say hey.

23:00.335 --> 23:00.944
- Will do.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.602
- Still here, Trip.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.430
- That's your boy,

23:08.474 --> 23:09.518
- Man, hold on real quick.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.519
- nigga.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.782
- So how you been?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.524
- I've been good, how are you?

23:15.568 --> 23:17.526
- Good.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.310
- Come on, nigga you know
I gotta go pick up Sheila.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.834
- Bigfoot can walk
her ass to the house.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.618
- Don't do her like that.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.272
And you know that shit
wasn't unnecessary.

23:24.315 --> 23:25.447
- Bro, hell if it wasn't.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.970
- He could have him both.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.538
All right, Jay not gonna
leave him and neither is she.

23:29.582 --> 23:30.713
- Bro you sure about Jay though?

23:30.757 --> 23:32.498
- She ain't left him yet.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.369
- And you know Daryl
gets his dirt in.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.676
- Bro, Jay is the best
thing to happen to Daryl.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.286
All right he crazy
if he fucks this up

23:38.329 --> 23:40.636
over little piece
of random pussy.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.812
- Out of his damn mind.
- Out of his damn mind.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.423
- Hold on real quick.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.511
- nigga, come on.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.990
- What?

23:47.034 --> 23:47.513
nigga damn.
- Damn.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.385
Bigfoot my ass.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.604
- They about to get it in.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.606
- What brings you by?

23:53.649 --> 23:55.042
- I was just wanting to see you.

23:56.696 --> 23:57.566
- Well here I am.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.658
- I thought maybe we
could go to the high bar

24:02.702 --> 24:06.706
you bought last time and I was
wanting to return the favor.

24:06.749 --> 24:07.924
- I can't meet you there again.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.448
- Why not?

24:09.491 --> 24:10.884
- You know my situation.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.625
Don't pretend like you don't.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.496
- But it's not like
you're married.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.890
- That doesn't mean that's
not my wifey, 'cause she is.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.805
- Well then why are
you here with me?

24:21.372 --> 24:21.938
- I'm at work.

24:23.549 --> 24:24.811
The question you
gotta ask yourself is,

24:24.854 --> 24:27.509
why are you here with me?

24:27.553 --> 24:28.641
- I don't know.

24:28.684 --> 24:29.511
- Yeah you do.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.559
- I thought you liked me.

24:33.602 --> 24:34.734
- I do.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.562
- Then what's the problem?

24:36.605 --> 24:38.694
- The problem is, you
don't know your role.

24:38.738 --> 24:39.695
- My role?

24:39.739 --> 24:41.088
- Yeah, your role.

24:55.755 --> 24:56.582
- Teach me.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.631
[chair squeaks]

25:02.675 --> 25:05.678
- And it was quite as kept uh,
now you know I love you sis.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.899
You probably not the
easiest person to live with.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.686
That dude had to take
a charge for you.

25:13.729 --> 25:18.734
If you looking for fair, you
landed at the wrong universe.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.564
- I ain't even looking for
fair, I just wanna feel safe.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.740
Is that too much
to ask for Graves?

25:24.784 --> 25:26.612
- Relationships are complicated,

25:28.135 --> 25:31.573
but I'm going to bet that
if it came down to it,

25:31.617 --> 25:33.488
he'd take a bullet for you.

25:33.532 --> 25:34.837
Am I right?

25:34.881 --> 25:37.797
[footsteps tapping]

25:37.840 --> 25:39.625
- You already
started without me?

25:39.668 --> 25:41.757
- Come on in, it's your liquor.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.411
[Martin laughs]
[Howard laughs]

25:43.454 --> 25:45.805
- And what are we talking about?

25:45.848 --> 25:47.589
- Oh, nothing important.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.721
[phone beeps]

25:48.764 --> 25:51.462
Um, anything interesting?

25:55.771 --> 26:00.080
Single woman, living
alone, oh poor thing.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.734
Wonder if she felt safe

26:01.777 --> 26:03.126
when someone was
breaking into her home.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.045
[door creaks]

26:17.750 --> 26:20.143
[spoon rattles]

26:20.187 --> 26:21.580
- Here you go.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.800
You need to eat.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.762
[spoon rattles]

26:29.805 --> 26:31.633
I'm sorry about the
little accident.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.722
- You hit me.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.942
- No I didn't.

26:37.508 --> 26:38.771
Judge Allen said so.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.601
- You hit me!

26:43.819 --> 26:45.734
- Lily, please.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.563
You can't prove anything,
then it never happened.

26:50.043 --> 26:54.047
- They don't know everything,
except for that Spangler.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.050
She doesn't like you.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.880
If I only I could
get her back again.

27:00.923 --> 27:01.750
- Hey.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.668
I will rejoice in the chance
to match ways with you

27:07.756 --> 27:09.062
and any woman you choose.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.674
- You're turning into Frank.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.765
- Is that supposed
to be an insult?

27:18.811 --> 27:22.771
You don't get what Frank
understood, but you will.

27:24.817 --> 27:27.123
And the quiet woman will shine
bright and be taken care of.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.866
Those who seek attention,

27:30.910 --> 27:35.784
subvert the will of God and
will face repercussions.

27:36.959 --> 27:39.222
Chapter five, verse nine.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.224
- That's not in the Bible.

27:41.268 --> 27:42.661
- God never stopped.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.098
Why would he?

27:46.229 --> 27:49.755
His word still reigns
down from heaven.

27:53.236 --> 27:57.763
Only, it's a word
no woman can hear.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.942
I'm gonna be down in
the basement working.

28:05.858 --> 28:06.772
You get some rest.

28:10.776 --> 28:11.994
Stay away from the door.

28:14.214 --> 28:15.781
- Can I ask you a question?

28:17.913 --> 28:19.132
- Yeah.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.699
- [Martin] Why?

28:20.742 --> 28:21.961
- Why, what?

28:22.004 --> 28:22.701
- Well, why here?

28:23.789 --> 28:25.268
You had to take a huge pay cut.

28:26.617 --> 28:27.793
Firms like Anderson & Elliot.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.795
They won't even look
at Howard or me.

28:32.623 --> 28:33.929
- This is where safe is.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.931
- Well that you have to explain.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.804
- My family looks good on paper.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.849
Two parents, dad's an engineer,

28:40.893 --> 28:43.722
my mother's a stay at
home, brother and sister.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.898
Perfect little nuclear family.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.247
But as my grandmother
used to say,

28:47.290 --> 28:48.901
whatever God gives
you on one side,

28:48.944 --> 28:50.772
he shows you on the other.

28:50.816 --> 28:55.298
So, one day, my father
grabbed my mother

28:55.342 --> 28:58.127
and put her through a window.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.955
- Oh.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.827
- That was the first time
that I ever came here.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.181
So I remember that judge,

29:08.224 --> 29:12.707
Judge McClellan in that
robe, on that bench.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.841
He protected us that night.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.712
Made sure my daddy
didn't come home.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.803
[footsteps clanging]

29:25.285 --> 29:27.896
- Well what do we have here?

29:27.940 --> 29:30.333
- Just decompressing
after a long day.

29:30.377 --> 29:31.813
Come on in and join us?

29:31.857 --> 29:34.947
- No, I don't think
so, not tonight.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.209
- Day's over, court's close.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.906
Come on, Spangler.

29:37.950 --> 29:41.344
- Ruth, I'm sorry
about this morning.

29:41.388 --> 29:43.738
I should not have
gotten upset with you.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.872
I'm not trying to hurt
you, it's just that--

29:46.915 --> 29:49.744
- We said what we needed
to say to one another.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.355
I'll bid you all good night.

29:52.399 --> 29:55.750
[footsteps clanging]

29:59.754 --> 30:01.190
[Martin laughs]
[Howard laughs]

30:01.234 --> 30:04.019
- I bid you all a good night.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.194
[Yvonne laughs]

30:05.238 --> 30:07.718
What happened this morning?

30:07.762 --> 30:09.677
- [Howard] Yeah?

30:09.720 --> 30:12.767
- I made 57
suggestions too many.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.205
- You do forward a
whole lot of emails.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.860
- I mean, well why
not just share?

30:18.904 --> 30:20.122
I mean, I don't know.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.820
I have an idea and I
just throw it out there.

30:23.038 --> 30:23.996
Share. [laughs]

30:24.039 --> 30:25.301
- Lester loves it.

30:27.042 --> 30:31.090
She says you have a
gift for logistics.

30:31.133 --> 30:32.221
[Yvonne laughs]
[Howard laughs]

30:32.265 --> 30:34.876
- Thank you. [laughs]

30:34.920 --> 30:36.922
She's never gonna
like me, is she?

30:36.965 --> 30:40.969
- Oh yeah, I, um, never, no.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.057
- No, never.

30:45.887 --> 30:48.107
[tense music]

30:55.897 --> 30:58.378
[dramatic music]

31:38.070 --> 31:40.899
[chains rattling]

31:43.902 --> 31:47.775
- Now, now it'll
all be over soon.

31:47.818 --> 31:48.776
[dramatic music]

31:48.819 --> 31:49.908
Let's get you dressed.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.085
[chains rattle]

31:53.128 --> 31:55.478
Let's see how these look on you.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.264
[dramatic music]

32:01.267 --> 32:02.921
No, no more of that.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.015
[ringing sound]

32:14.541 --> 32:15.498
[chains rattling]
Now these

32:15.542 --> 32:17.196
are from the Snyder era.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.938
He was here the
longest, eight years.

32:19.981 --> 32:22.941
Personally I prefer
the one night stands

[tense music]

32:28.859 --> 32:29.469
You're a mother.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.125
You have Jordan
and Tensley, right?

32:33.168 --> 32:35.214
Don't you think
it's important to

32:35.257 --> 32:38.043
provide them with a
safe, secure environment?

32:39.392 --> 32:40.175
[dramatic music]

32:40.219 --> 32:42.177
You understand.

32:42.221 --> 32:46.399
- Ah, the morning after blouse.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.880
Every time she came
out with this rob on,

32:51.099 --> 32:52.883
I knew there was a
guy in the house.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.322
[tense music]

33:04.156 --> 33:06.985

33:12.468 --> 33:13.861
Yeah, I know, I know.
[dramatic music]

33:13.904 --> 33:14.993
It's old fashioned.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.214
Now I'm gonna get
these developed

33:19.258 --> 33:21.042
and I'm gonna let
you look at them,

33:21.086 --> 33:24.263
and then you decide if
you want to look at them.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.309
We'll go from there.

33:33.141 --> 33:36.101
[ringing sound]

33:36.144 --> 33:39.104
You know, it's not that I think
all women are irredeemable.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.586
I just haven't met any who
feel the need to be redeemed.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.068
- One more for the road!

33:47.112 --> 33:48.896
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.158
I'm already one too
many for the road.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.420
I have to call an Uber.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.553
- Oh, can't do that.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.425
- What do you mean,
I can't drive.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.559
- Drunk in the back
of an Uber Judge?

33:59.602 --> 34:01.039
Not a good look.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.432
Call Daryl.

34:03.476 --> 34:06.044
- Yeah that'll
help my situation.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.306
- Call him.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.221
Just tell him you
need to be rescued.

34:09.264 --> 34:13.268
- [laughs] What I need to
do is to go to bed without,

34:13.312 --> 34:14.181
um--
- Look at those shoes.

34:15.313 --> 34:16.489
[Yvonne laughs]
[Howard laughs]

34:16.532 --> 34:20.319
Stop, stop. [laughs]

34:20.362 --> 34:22.234
What I need to do is go to
bed without hearing about

34:22.277 --> 34:24.149
how much trouble I am.

34:24.192 --> 34:25.280
That's what I need.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.281
- Yeah, no worries.

34:26.324 --> 34:27.326
I can take you home.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.244
- What's that look for, Howard?

34:32.286 --> 34:35.159
You can't believe
the rumors can you?

34:35.203 --> 34:37.248
- I don't know from rumors.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.206
I know you.

34:39.251 --> 34:40.208
- No, no, no.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.471
You know the rumors.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.995
- I've got my eyes on you.

34:45.039 --> 34:45.996
- Okay, okay.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.043
[Yvonne laughs]

34:49.087 --> 34:50.958
- Yeah, you let
me take your home.

34:51.001 --> 34:55.484
- No, that's just dumb 'cause
you live 10 minutes that way.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.965
And I live 10 minutes this way.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.532
He lives 10 minutes
this way too.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.448
Which is you're practically
right around the corner from me.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.319
- Yeah, Howard, this is dumb.

35:04.363 --> 35:07.583
I live 10 minutes that way
and, and 10 minutes, and uh,

35:07.627 --> 35:08.715
I'm gonna get my coat.

35:10.195 --> 35:11.544
Yeah.

35:11.587 --> 35:12.414
- Get this.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.551
You watch out for him.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.161
- Allen?

35:20.205 --> 35:21.728
Please, what's he gonna do?

35:23.425 --> 35:26.167
- You are two sheets
to the wind, sis.

35:27.734 --> 35:32.217
- Graves, I've been
doing me my entire life.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.131
I know how this works.

35:35.698 --> 35:36.482
- Ciao.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.005
[Yvonne laughs]

35:38.048 --> 35:38.658
- Goodnight.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.051
- I'll see ya girl.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.401
Call me when you get home.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.054
- Found it.
- I shall.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.186
- Come on.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.144
- Y'all drive careful now.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.711
- You get home safely too.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.452
- There's only one
way to drive, come on.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.286
- There we go. [laughs]

35:59.374 --> 36:01.115
- Oh,
- Mm-hmm.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.466
- I never took you
for that kind of guy.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.294
- Guy who likes good music?

36:06.338 --> 36:08.470
[Yvonne laughs]

Never touched the hair.

36:12.779 --> 36:15.608
- Okay. [laughs]

36:15.651 --> 36:20.134
What did you mean when you said
that'll help your situation?

36:20.178 --> 36:23.268
Is there a situation
between you and Daryl?

36:24.704 --> 36:27.228
- No idea what
you're talking about.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.752
- So that's just
between you and Graves.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.537
Is it a black thing?

36:31.580 --> 36:34.583
- No, it's a none of
your damn business thing.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.238
You wanna talk, talk about
your own relationship.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.458
- Well, as an act of good
faith, I'll say this.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.243
I've had some less
than cinematic endings

36:42.287 --> 36:44.463
to a few relationships
and that's all.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.333
- Explain.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.684
- I want what I want
and I never lie.

36:48.728 --> 36:49.511
[Yvonne laughs]

36:49.555 --> 36:50.686
- But.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.297
- But, they never believe me.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.125
- And?

36:55.169 --> 36:56.301
- And nothing.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.693
They always get mad about it.

36:57.737 --> 36:58.564
- Hmm.

37:00.522 --> 37:01.697
- Well don't you want to know?

37:01.741 --> 37:02.568
- Know what?

37:05.179 --> 37:05.745
- What I like.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.662
- You can do one of two things.

37:09.705 --> 37:12.273
You can take your
hand off of my leg

37:12.317 --> 37:15.189
or you can get your
story together.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.712
- My story?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.497
- Mm-hmm, the story you
gotta tell everybody tomorrow

37:18.540 --> 37:19.541
when they figure out you
only got four fingers

37:19.585 --> 37:21.369
instead of five on that hand.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.154
[Martin laughs]

37:24.198 --> 37:26.113
- Did I, uh, misread you?

37:26.156 --> 37:27.767
- You misunderstood me.

37:27.810 --> 37:28.637
- How so?

37:30.291 --> 37:32.511
- I'm neither
impressed nor in need.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.252
[car horn honks]
- Which means what?

37:35.340 --> 37:37.298
- You're an elegant creeper.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.647
You present perfectly.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.780
Handsome, powerful.

37:40.823 --> 37:43.304
You want women to want you

37:43.348 --> 37:45.611
but not in a way
that ties you up.

37:47.395 --> 37:49.310
So you tell 'em upfront that
there's no future in this

37:49.354 --> 37:51.443
even though you
act like there is.

37:51.486 --> 37:55.490
So you let the feeling of a
commitment creep up on them.

37:55.534 --> 38:00.539
And then you can always go back
to that declarative sentence

38:02.497 --> 38:04.194
that you said in the beginning
that keeps them at bay.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.678
- May I ask how you
came by that analysis?

38:09.722 --> 38:12.246
- You address how people
feel when you sentence them.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.423
- Okay, how does that
translate to my love life?

38:15.467 --> 38:19.558
- Men tend to hone their
most effective skills

38:19.601 --> 38:21.255
when trying to bag women.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.778
[Martin laughs]

38:22.822 --> 38:26.304
You got status and you
look good for a white dude.

38:27.566 --> 38:28.654
- Which means?

38:28.697 --> 38:29.524
- Hmm?

38:31.526 --> 38:33.615
Your current girlfriend's
name is Denise, right?

38:33.659 --> 38:35.443
- You met her at the
Bar Association dinner.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.445
Did you two have a
conversation about me?

38:37.489 --> 38:38.446
[Yvonne laughs]

38:38.490 --> 38:39.621
- What do you think?

38:39.665 --> 38:40.883
She performed for you all night.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.496
Flirted with different women.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.367
I think she procures for you.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.717
You went in that
threesome thing.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.416
She's gorgeous, well educated.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.808
A woman like that
isn't doing it for fun.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.636
She's doing it for a ring.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.596
But the problem is that
you're so bored with her

38:57.639 --> 39:01.295
then she wants a commitment
to take it to the next level.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.732
So, therefore, you
are ghosting her.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.912
- And you know this how?

39:11.261 --> 39:12.524
[Yvonne laughs]

39:12.567 --> 39:13.568
- The clerk's office.

39:15.614 --> 39:18.356
Whenever you decide that
you're bored with a woman,

39:18.399 --> 39:19.618
you block her from your phone

39:19.661 --> 39:21.402
and they start calling
the clerk's office.

39:21.446 --> 39:22.621
All the clerks talk about it.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.581
[Yvonne laughs]

39:26.625 --> 39:29.671
- Okay, so one last question.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.586
Do we have a problem here?

39:31.630 --> 39:33.806
- Why would we have a problem?

39:33.849 --> 39:35.547
- So we don't have
a problem here.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.941
- I don't, but I think you do.

39:38.985 --> 39:39.942
[Martin laughs]

39:39.986 --> 39:40.943
- What do you mean?

39:40.987 --> 39:41.857
- Is that your house?

39:46.732 --> 39:47.689
- Oh shit.
