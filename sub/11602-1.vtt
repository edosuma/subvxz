01:19.560 --> 01:25.560
Rip by DanDee

01:46.561 --> 01:47.441
Stop him!

01:48.961 --> 01:49.921
Somebody stop him!

02:11.041 --> 02:12.401
Asshole!

02:13.201 --> 02:15.321
You Flemish asshole!

02:17.041 --> 02:18.001
Fuck you!

02:22.601 --> 02:26.321
Son of a bitch! Where were you?
I was followed.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.401
Shut the fuck up.
- Step on it!

02:28.601 --> 02:30.201
Get off my balls.

02:36.441 --> 02:39.161
With your fisher's pouch.
You don't even know how to dress.

02:39.361 --> 02:42.121
Are those shoes or paninis?
- Shoes, asshole.

02:42.321 --> 02:44.321
They're white as whores.

02:45.601 --> 02:47.561
Don't listen to that dickhead!

02:49.401 --> 02:51.441
You see these fingers? See them?

02:52.721 --> 02:54.601
Hey, Matti!
Missed you, bro!

02:54.801 --> 02:56.521
Hey Marwan, you OK?

02:56.721 --> 02:58.241
Hi guys.

02:58.441 --> 03:00.161
You OK?
- Yeah.

03:03.241 --> 03:04.441
You OK, Sindi?

03:04.641 --> 03:07.961
If there's money, I'm there.
- Of course there is.

03:08.161 --> 03:10.601
Of course there's money.

03:10.801 --> 03:12.241
Woah, an iPhone!

03:12.441 --> 03:14.121
Here, tampons for you!

03:14.321 --> 03:17.041
Hey,
don't treat me like a kid.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.161
Oh, there are cards. I'm good!

03:19.361 --> 03:22.281
Visa? Can't use that.
- A Mastercard, guys.

03:22.481 --> 03:24.361
Fuck me, you did well this time.

03:24.561 --> 03:25.881
Police.

03:27.481 --> 03:30.121
Quick, quick.
Take this, hide it.

03:30.321 --> 03:32.361
Let's go.
- Quick, come on.

03:34.321 --> 03:35.721
See you later.

03:37.361 --> 03:40.241
Fuck, there's Mina.
She should calm down...

03:42.241 --> 03:43.601
Nassim, Marwan.

03:45.441 --> 03:47.001
Is there a problem, Mina?

03:49.281 --> 03:52.441
No school today guys?
- No, it's a holiday.

03:52.641 --> 03:55.081
Nice of your school.
Wish I had as much time off.

03:55.281 --> 03:58.001
You know, Mina,
what you're doing isn't work.

03:59.601 --> 04:02.481
I've had a complaint today,
a bag stolen from a car.

04:02.681 --> 04:05.241
Know anything about it?
- Do you know anything?

04:05.441 --> 04:07.761
No. You?
- We don't know anything, Mina.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.721
Foreigners again?
- Yeah...

04:10.921 --> 04:12.761
Bitch.
- What did you say?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.001
Come on.
- I'm watching you.

04:22.441 --> 04:24.401
Hey, tough girl!

04:24.601 --> 04:26.841
What's your problem?
- Nothing.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.841
I ask a question and you answer.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.241
Leave her alone.
- No, but...

04:31.441 --> 04:33.281
She doesn't want to talk to you.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.321
Let her get on with her shit.

04:35.521 --> 04:38.801
But she could tell us which guy
she likes the most.

04:46.961 --> 04:48.521
Do you want a drag, sis?

04:50.921 --> 04:52.761
Things OK with aunt Augustine?

04:53.281 --> 04:54.281
Yeah.

04:57.841 --> 04:58.761
He's moving!

04:58.961 --> 05:01.361
Tell the brat to calm down
or I'll fuck his mother.

05:01.561 --> 05:03.121
Or some cunt!
- I don't give a shit.

05:06.521 --> 05:08.401
Guys, let's go.

05:09.441 --> 05:11.361
New chick,
fix us some booze.

05:20.401 --> 05:21.961
Yeah, it's over there.

05:46.481 --> 05:47.561
Stop!

06:39.561 --> 06:41.401
<i>Yo, keep it cool with my bro!</i>

06:42.281 --> 06:44.321
I fucking hate cops.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.761
Let me go.
- Don't push me, man.

06:46.961 --> 06:48.721
Bastard. Son of a bitch.

06:48.921 --> 06:51.601
Sit down and cut the bullshit.
- Fuck off you racist!

06:51.801 --> 06:53.281
You, come with me.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.241
Speak French.
- Shut up!

06:57.681 --> 06:58.961
So tell me...

06:59.801 --> 07:01.921
Why did you steal the bottles?

07:03.401 --> 07:06.721
Marie-Evelyne...
Why did you steal the bottles?

07:07.521 --> 07:08.521
Fuck you!

07:08.721 --> 07:11.081
I was thirsty.
- You were thirsty.

07:11.441 --> 07:13.441
And you couldn't pay for them?

07:13.641 --> 07:14.681
Marie-Evelyne?

07:15.401 --> 07:16.481
No.

07:17.241 --> 07:18.881
You know, sir...

07:19.161 --> 07:21.761
My mom's in prison,
so is my brother,

07:21.961 --> 07:24.001
my dad is too,
and my sister,

07:24.201 --> 07:25.441
even my aunt...

07:25.641 --> 07:27.881
Crappy childhood, huh?

07:28.401 --> 07:29.761
Well, guess what?

07:30.121 --> 07:34.041
Your mom in prison is actually
on her way to pick you up.

07:34.761 --> 07:36.441
You can wait for her outside.

07:55.681 --> 07:57.681
Are you staring at me?
- Yep.

07:57.881 --> 07:59.761
It's that outfit.

07:59.961 --> 08:01.761
Should I be wearing a burqa?

08:02.401 --> 08:04.761
Listen to you, you little whore.

08:04.961 --> 08:08.001
You think I don't understand Dutch?
Faggot

08:08.201 --> 08:10.281
Slut.
- Bastard.

08:10.481 --> 08:13.041
Why are you here?
- None of your business.

08:13.681 --> 08:15.121
What about you?

08:15.321 --> 08:17.441
I found a Mastercard.
They don't believe me.

08:17.641 --> 08:19.561
Did you buy your Nikes
with it?

08:19.761 --> 08:23.161
No, I found them.
But on someone else's feet.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.521
You're lucky.

08:25.721 --> 08:28.041
With a great mug like mine?
Course I am.

08:32.241 --> 08:34.721
Oh no, not her.
- Hi, Marwan. It's been a while.

08:35.241 --> 08:37.801
When are you going to grow up?

08:38.280 --> 08:40.121
Don't you want to be a man?

08:40.321 --> 08:42.201
Why do you think it was us?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.121
Someone saw you.
- Fuck you.

08:46.241 --> 08:50.321
That's nice. We'll notify your parents
and we'll see...

08:56.281 --> 08:57.161
What did she say?

08:57.361 --> 09:00.401
I'll be a famous rapper someday
and she'll buy all my albums.

09:03.081 --> 09:05.601
I'm lucky to talk to you then.
- Absolutely.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.321
Let me have your number.
I want to see you again.

09:08.521 --> 09:10.081
I don't go out with Moroccans.

09:10.281 --> 09:11.841
We're all Africans.

09:12.041 --> 09:15.721
So if your sister or cousin
came home with a black guy,

09:15.921 --> 09:18.321
you wouldn't mind?
- It's not the same.

09:18.521 --> 09:20.561
You're a girl, I'm a guy.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.921
Marie-Evelyne!

09:22.281 --> 09:23.161
Come here.

09:25.601 --> 09:26.441
Here.

09:29.721 --> 09:31.281
What did you do?

09:31.481 --> 09:33.601
Nothing.
- Come along.

09:36.801 --> 09:38.161
Princess, wait.

09:42.161 --> 09:44.481
How long have you been cutting class?
- Mom...

09:44.681 --> 09:46.721
Is that a carnival costume?

09:47.841 --> 09:50.201
No, it's for the play.

09:50.401 --> 09:53.601
Play? It's not a play,
it's a black women's circus.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.721
An integration project in Dutch.

09:55.921 --> 09:58.361
You think you'll get a job?
Your Dutch is crap.

09:58.561 --> 10:00.001
Marie-Evelyne, enough.

10:00.201 --> 10:03.081
But you've got a medical degree!
- I might meet some people.

10:03.281 --> 10:05.201
Black graduates like you.

10:05.401 --> 10:07.281
I won't waste my time
going to school.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.281
This is our degree, our black skin.
It will always be like that.

10:10.481 --> 10:12.161
With that attitude, sure...

10:12.361 --> 10:13.761
At least, I try.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.161
You should keep away from
your cousin and his scum.

10:16.361 --> 10:18.241
They're my friends.
They respect me.

10:18.441 --> 10:21.041
Respect you?
You don't even respect yourself.

10:21.241 --> 10:24.001
Is that how I brought you up?
- Fuck off.

10:48.641 --> 10:50.201
<i>Ixelles police, open up!</i>

10:52.161 --> 10:54.601
<i>Ixelles police!
- Hide the stuff.</i>

10:54.801 --> 10:56.681
It's fucking Don!

10:58.361 --> 11:00.561
You prick, stop fucking around.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.121
How's it going?

11:03.201 --> 11:04.601
Where's the main man?

11:04.801 --> 11:05.761
Hi, bro.

11:05.961 --> 11:08.401
We dropped the goods 'cos of you.
Police my ass!

11:10.561 --> 11:12.721
Out so soon?
Did you fuck a prison guard?

11:12.921 --> 11:15.521
Careful what you say, man.

11:16.241 --> 11:18.561
You, how are you?
Cool.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.921
Mama Justelle.

11:22.121 --> 11:25.001
Ma-ma Jus-telle.
- That's me!

11:25.201 --> 11:26.801
Alright? How's it going?

11:27.361 --> 11:28.761
There are girls here.

11:29.801 --> 11:32.041
Who's that chick?
- She's my cousin.

11:32.241 --> 11:35.521
Pretty cousin, bro.
- Thanks, but keep your hands off.

11:35.721 --> 11:37.161
What do you mean?

11:37.361 --> 11:39.041
Is this guy for real?

11:39.241 --> 11:41.601
All girls in the gang
follow the rules, yeah?

11:42.921 --> 11:45.521
Notorious, your cousin
is an exception...

11:46.321 --> 11:47.921
for now.

11:51.721 --> 11:53.721
Listen to me, you little bastard.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.881
Your brother took the rap for you.

11:56.081 --> 11:59.201
If I see your face in the street again,
you'll wish I hadn't.

11:59.401 --> 12:00.841
OK?
- You stink.

12:05.801 --> 12:06.721
Marwan.

12:07.481 --> 12:09.321
It's OK, Mom, please.

12:10.081 --> 12:11.801
So are you proud of yourself?

12:12.001 --> 12:14.001
Think you and your brother are right?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.201
On the right path?
Like you?

12:16.401 --> 12:17.881
I'm not Flemish, dad.

12:18.081 --> 12:19.601
Where is your brother?

13:40.961 --> 13:42.881
I'm going down in for three months.

13:43.081 --> 13:44.641
I had grass on me.

13:44.841 --> 13:46.521
What will I do without you?

13:46.721 --> 13:50.801
Don't worry,
three months go by real fast.

13:53.441 --> 13:54.601
OK.

13:57.201 --> 14:00.321
Three months in a detention center.
- It's too long.

14:00.521 --> 14:03.041
These fucking cops,
they give us so much shit.

14:03.241 --> 14:06.521
All that 'cos we're Moroccan!
- Fuck, you're not even Moroccan!

14:06.721 --> 14:09.201
Shut the fuck up, Marwan,
son of a bitch!

14:11.161 --> 14:12.441
Are you OK?

14:13.121 --> 14:15.721
You could do so much better than him.
- Yeah?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.441
Me, for example.
- Yeah.

14:17.641 --> 14:20.201
Three months, I don't understand.
It was just grass.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.441
It's too long.
- Don't worry.

14:22.841 --> 14:24.601
It won't take long.

14:25.441 --> 14:26.441
Let's move.

14:38.281 --> 14:40.521
Hi, you!
You OK?

14:41.201 --> 14:43.001
You OK?
- Yeah.

14:43.201 --> 14:45.401
What's your name?
- Doris.

14:45.601 --> 14:47.201
Doris, I like it.

14:47.401 --> 14:50.561
Just looking at you, I feel like
there's something between us.

14:50.761 --> 14:51.721
Air.

14:51.921 --> 14:54.761
You're really pretty, I swear.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.801
You're pretty too.
- Shut up. Hands off.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.601
Shut it, you ugly bitch.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.161
Watch your mouth.

15:05.001 --> 15:08.281
I like girls with personality.
- You want some personality?

15:08.481 --> 15:09.521
Alonzo!

15:14.041 --> 15:14.881
Alonzo.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.841
Got a problem?
- Me? No.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.561
Get up.
- What?

15:25.761 --> 15:27.801
Don't talk to her.
- I'm being polite.

15:28.001 --> 15:30.001
I said don't talk to her.

15:30.201 --> 15:31.601
Why?
- She's my girl.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.521
I couldn't give a damn.
- Oh yeah?

15:33.721 --> 15:36.361
I'll kick your head in.
You won't say that again.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.881
She did this to me...

15:38.081 --> 15:40.321
Shut your fucking mouth.
Are you crazy?

15:40.521 --> 15:42.921
I'm going to fuck you up.
- I like girls like that.

15:43.121 --> 15:44.561
Come on. Let's go.

15:45.441 --> 15:47.241
Next time,
I'll smash your face in.

15:47.441 --> 15:50.321
If I catch you, you're dead.
- Your slut's too ugly for me.

15:52.241 --> 15:54.121
Screw you, niggers!

16:09.121 --> 16:11.001
Run, get the others!

16:17.161 --> 16:18.841
YOU like it, uh?

16:40.441 --> 16:43.201
That's it, guys.
Notorious, hold him.

16:49.281 --> 16:50.801
Yeah, show-off.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.241
Shut the fuck up.

17:11.121 --> 17:12.080
Son of a bitch.

17:12.721 --> 17:13.881
Cops!

17:19.441 --> 17:21.641
Do you know
the guys who beat up your friends?

17:22.401 --> 17:23.361
<i>No 'ma?</i>

17:23.921 --> 17:24.721
No idea.

17:26.121 --> 17:29.121
I was reading a book.
- You, reading a book?

17:29.321 --> 17:30.841
Yeah, Shakespeare.

17:31.041 --> 17:34.041
It was nothing.
Just a bit of banter between friends.

17:34.241 --> 17:35.801
I was looking the other way.

17:36.001 --> 17:38.801
I heard sirens, I went to look
and now I'm here.

17:39.001 --> 17:40.681
An accident at home.
I fell.

17:40.881 --> 17:44.241
I wasn't fighting.
I bumped into a wall.

17:45.121 --> 17:48.001
<i>Black Bronx?
I don't even know who they are.</i>

17:48.201 --> 17:50.441
I suppose you saw nothing
in the metro?

17:52.401 --> 17:55.201
Do you have a boyfriend?
- Why?

17:55.401 --> 17:57.361
Just curious.

17:57.561 --> 17:59.321
Listen, mister...

17:59.521 --> 18:02.081
You're a bit old for me.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.841
Your guy isn't in the gang
that we arrested?

18:06.041 --> 18:08.321
I don't have a guy.
- You don't have a guy.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.481
Here, call me whenever you want.

18:15.001 --> 18:17.361
Did you know a girl
called Malou?

18:18.641 --> 18:20.921
No?
You remind me of her.

18:21.121 --> 18:24.041
The prettiest girl in her hood.
- Thanks.

18:24.241 --> 18:27.441
She was young, intelligent, kind.
A real princess.

18:27.641 --> 18:29.401
She had it all going for her.

18:32.201 --> 18:34.921
Then, she started hanging out
with the wrong people.

18:37.081 --> 18:39.041
I must have
a photo of her somewhere.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.401
Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:24.601 --> 19:26.481
How do you say that?

19:30.201 --> 19:31.401
It's difficult.

19:55.401 --> 19:58.321
You see? If you don't wear this cap,
you don't have any class.

19:58.521 --> 20:02.521
Actually, guys like you kill class,
I swear.

20:02.721 --> 20:05.481
And how's your head?
- Don't worry, it's nothing.

20:06.641 --> 20:09.241
Marie-Evelyne, you shouldn't be
with those guys.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.681
Firstly, it's Mavela.
I like them.

20:11.881 --> 20:14.161
And your friends?
They fucked up Don's arm.

20:14.361 --> 20:17.321
Six weeks in plaster.
- Jerking off will be difficult.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.321
We're the 1080s.

20:21.681 --> 20:24.161
A postcode?
- Yeah, and who are you?

20:24.361 --> 20:25.641
<i>The Black Bronx.</i>

20:25.841 --> 20:28.921
<i>The Black Bronx!
We're not in Chicago, sweetheart.</i>

20:29.401 --> 20:31.161
Idiot, the Bronx is in New York.

20:31.361 --> 20:34.281
New York, Chicago, it's all America.
What do I care?

20:37.761 --> 20:39.841
I swear, it's sexy.
Wait, let me try.

20:42.281 --> 20:43.241
Stop it.

20:43.441 --> 20:46.041
So you can burp but not me?
- Not on purpose.

20:46.241 --> 20:49.281
<i>You're in the Black Bronx
and you feel bad when you burp?</i>

20:49.481 --> 20:51.761
You can't be serious.
But it was sexy.

20:51.961 --> 20:54.401
Sexy? You like it?
- I love it.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.321
You were classy but without the cap.

20:57.761 --> 20:59.561
There, now you're classy.

21:01.001 --> 21:04.001
Stop making fun of me.
- "I'm Marwan..."

21:04.201 --> 21:06.401
Right now, for example,
you look classy.

21:49.601 --> 21:50.841
What's wrong?

21:51.041 --> 21:52.201
Nothing.
- Sure?

21:55.201 --> 21:57.361
I have to go.
- Don't worry, stay.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.481
If you're desperate to see me again,
let me know.

22:26.081 --> 22:28.041
Pig headed cop.
- Did you see that?

22:28.241 --> 22:31.401
The egg I ate this morning,
it was exactly the same thing.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.881
You still got that black cop's card?
- Yeah.

22:34.081 --> 22:36.921
Give it here.
- We gonna make a big joint of it.

22:37.121 --> 22:39.761
You missed one, bro.
Right beside me, left, right.

22:39.961 --> 22:42.161
I gave him that right up the ass.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.921
Nassim. Fucker, that hurts!

22:45.121 --> 22:46.321
Let go, you dick.

22:46.521 --> 22:49.761
Give me five minutes with my brother?
I need to talk to him.

22:49.961 --> 22:52.241
No problem.

22:53.521 --> 22:56.321
Wait for me outside, buddy.
- OK.

22:58.601 --> 23:00.641
How's it outside?
- OK.

23:01.401 --> 23:03.641
Don't those guys piss you off?
- What?

23:04.241 --> 23:05.961
It's better when you're there.

23:06.161 --> 23:08.081
How's Loubna?
- She's doing good.

23:08.281 --> 23:09.921
Take care of her.
- Of course.

23:10.121 --> 23:11.761
You'd want to.
- Chill man.

23:11.961 --> 23:14.721
Don't tell me to chill.
- I've got things sorted.

23:14.921 --> 23:16.201
And your Miss Italy?

23:16.401 --> 23:18.001
How's she?

23:18.561 --> 23:22.321
Seriously, is she OK?
- When she's not a pain in the ass.

23:22.521 --> 23:24.081
And she keeps her mouth shut.

23:24.281 --> 23:25.401
What's the saying?

23:26.681 --> 23:28.641
Ours is a great love story.

23:43.321 --> 23:45.121
Wait, they're coming out.

23:47.321 --> 23:48.801
Shit. They're here.

23:49.521 --> 23:51.081
They've come out.

23:54.121 --> 23:56.321
Are you ready?
- Go on then.

24:02.481 --> 24:04.041
Fuck you, COPS!

24:56.281 --> 24:58.241
Hey bro, need something?

25:01.961 --> 25:04.041
Need something?

25:06.081 --> 25:08.121
Want some grass?

25:08.681 --> 25:09.481
Twenty?

25:09.681 --> 25:12.521
How much?
- Twenty. Don't worry, it's good stuff.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.841
Girls, come here a minute.
We need to talk.

25:24.961 --> 25:26.881
Mr. Dominique is here.

25:50.961 --> 25:53.681
You want dope all the time
and this is all you get for it?

25:53.881 --> 25:57.561
One of my guys isn't working right now,
Mr. Dominique.

25:58.201 --> 26:00.121
I'm going to send another guy.

26:00.321 --> 26:03.601
You don't need to do that,
Mr. Dominique. I'll sort...

26:41.441 --> 26:42.881
Mr. Koffi Kemba.

26:43.081 --> 26:45.161
My young African friends.

26:45.361 --> 26:48.161
We don't really have time
but we're gonna hurry.

26:48.361 --> 26:49.241
With pleasure.

26:51.201 --> 26:52.721
Who wants to take a picture?

27:10.761 --> 27:12.001
<i>Thank you.</i>

27:12.761 --> 27:14.241
Thank you, Brussels.

27:15.241 --> 27:17.281
Can you feel the heat,
Brussels?

27:17.481 --> 27:19.321
Can I have an autograph?
For my mom.

27:19.521 --> 27:20.721
With pleasure.

27:20.921 --> 27:24.121
What's her name?
- Augustine.

27:26.401 --> 27:29.041
Enjoy the concert.
I'm off.

27:33.881 --> 27:35.481
Mr. Koffi Kemba,

27:35.681 --> 27:37.601
we'll be your security
for tonight.

27:37.801 --> 27:40.001
I've already got security.
What security?

27:41.601 --> 27:43.161
Trust me,
Mr. Koffi Kemba,

27:43.361 --> 27:45.841
my guys and I will do
a much better job.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.561
What happens if someone
shoots at the crowd?

27:49.201 --> 27:50.961
Or if someone's killed?

27:53.961 --> 27:55.601
It would be a terrible shame.

27:59.601 --> 28:02.241
3.000 euro cash
and you won't have to worry tonight.

28:08.001 --> 28:09.761
The entire night.

28:09.961 --> 28:11.961
Take it or leave it.

28:14.281 --> 28:16.241
I'll find the manager for you.

28:16.441 --> 28:18.481
Good decision.

29:02.961 --> 29:04.921
<i>Can we hook up?</i>

29:11.441 --> 29:12.921
<i>OK.</i>

29:14.761 --> 29:17.081
OK, boss? Five Jacks.

29:17.281 --> 29:19.721
How are things, Mavela?

29:19.921 --> 29:21.841
Drink?
- A coke.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.161
A coke?
- Yes.

29:24.361 --> 29:27.601
No, whiskey, boss. Add a shot of whiskey.
- A coke, please.

29:27.801 --> 29:31.321
She'll have a whiskey.
A double.

29:33.401 --> 29:35.921
She's cute, though.
What do you think, chief?

29:36.761 --> 29:38.481
She's a pretty little thing.

29:41.081 --> 29:43.041
With her little eyes. Cute.

29:45.001 --> 29:46.361
I like her.

29:49.161 --> 29:50.761
Let go of me.

29:52.481 --> 29:53.841
Let go of me.

29:54.801 --> 29:56.361
Leave her alone.

29:57.121 --> 30:00.281
Not here, not now.
- Cool, baby, it's good.

30:30.081 --> 30:33.201
Mavela! I want to show you something.
- I don't have much time.

30:33.401 --> 30:36.001
I want to tell you something.
- It can wait. Come on!

30:36.321 --> 30:37.801
Through here.

30:39.121 --> 30:40.601
Let me help you.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.681
Where are we going?
- Don't worry.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.201
Go in.

30:55.481 --> 30:57.201
I'm going to show you something.

30:57.401 --> 30:58.721
Something amazing.

31:04.641 --> 31:06.201
Look at that.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.881
What's your wish?

31:44.081 --> 31:47.041
Nothing.
It's just to keep her feet warm.

31:47.921 --> 31:50.001
I thought you'd wished for us.

31:52.481 --> 31:55.721
I came to tell you
that it's better we stop things now,

31:55.921 --> 31:58.121
before we really go too far.

31:58.321 --> 31:59.321
Do you understand?

31:59.521 --> 32:01.881
<i>Maybe you should leave
the Black Bronx?</i>

32:02.081 --> 32:04.201
<i>I don't want to leave the Black Bronx.</i>

32:05.161 --> 32:06.961
You won't or you can't?

32:13.841 --> 32:15.001
Come on.

32:29.641 --> 32:33.201
Look, I made all this,
just for you.

32:36.041 --> 32:39.201
But maybe you're right.
We should stop seeing each other.

34:22.841 --> 34:24.201
Doris, are you OK?

34:25.601 --> 34:28.400
Where's Alonzo?
- He's gone.

34:29.681 --> 34:34.121
<i>He's left the Black Bronx?
- It's over. He has someone else.</i>

34:35.001 --> 34:38.161
You really don't understand.
They're sons of bitches.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.561
They fuck anything in a skirt,

34:40.761 --> 34:42.360
and then dump us like shit.

34:42.561 --> 34:44.681
When we do anything,
they never forgive us.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.761
Come on, calm down.

35:03.281 --> 35:05.721
Have a drag.
- No, I've got some pussy to take care of.

35:06.801 --> 35:08.401
Alonzo.

35:09.921 --> 35:12.601
Fuck off, bitch.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.561
Alonzo...

35:38.601 --> 35:40.561
You're going to leave me all on my own?

35:40.761 --> 35:42.521
Will you come and see me?

35:51.721 --> 35:53.241
I have to go.

35:53.441 --> 35:55.441
<i>Ream?
- Y es.</i>

36:03.561 --> 36:05.321
Mavela, be careful.

36:06.801 --> 36:08.321
Be very careful.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.921
It's not a game.

36:11.121 --> 36:13.041
OK. Bye.

37:38.321 --> 37:41.081
See the girl over there?
The waitress?

37:42.281 --> 37:44.281
Isn't that the girl from...
- 1080.

37:48.561 --> 37:50.441
Bring her to the apartment in an hour.

37:52.721 --> 37:54.281
What are you going to do?

37:56.241 --> 37:58.321
No questions, go on.

38:04.961 --> 38:06.521
Can I sit here?

38:08.801 --> 38:10.241
We've already met.

38:10.441 --> 38:13.081
Me? No.
- Yes, it's you.

38:18.521 --> 38:20.601
How old are you?
- Sixteen.

38:20.801 --> 38:23.801
You've never had a boyfriend?
Never?

38:24.001 --> 38:25.361
You don't go out?
- No.

38:25.561 --> 38:27.361
Where's your burqa?

38:28.001 --> 38:29.761
You're crazy.

38:30.801 --> 38:32.441
I'm not joking.
- What?

38:32.641 --> 38:34.761
I'm not joking with you.
- What do you mean?

38:34.961 --> 38:38.441
Fancy a joint to chill out?
- I don't know.

38:38.641 --> 38:42.281
A little one. You've been working hard,
you need to relax.

38:43.441 --> 38:45.761
And then you can put that bag down.
- OK, quickly.

38:45.961 --> 38:47.201
It's here.

38:52.681 --> 38:54.081
Like it?
- It's crazy.

38:54.281 --> 38:55.841
It's big, hey?

38:56.881 --> 38:59.561
Wait there, I'll get the grass.
OK?

39:18.281 --> 39:20.201
Are you lost?

39:24.681 --> 39:27.521
Did you get lost?
What's going on?

39:28.521 --> 39:30.801
Do you want to try a black dick?

39:31.001 --> 39:33.161
Ever tried a black dick?

40:12.761 --> 40:14.681
Get off me.

40:15.241 --> 40:16.841
Get off her.

40:19.481 --> 40:21.801
Stop!

40:22.001 --> 40:24.441
Stop!
Please, stop!

40:26.041 --> 40:28.681
Stop.

40:28.881 --> 40:31.961
Please, stop!

41:02.841 --> 41:04.601
Chill, you'll get used to it.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.321
You're not afraid
she'll go to the cops?

41:08.961 --> 41:11.601
The cops couldn't give a shit.

41:12.001 --> 41:14.041
They know it's a gang thing.

41:14.481 --> 41:17.001
<i>Last year, one of the Black Justice
was stabbed.</i>

41:17.201 --> 41:20.201
Everyone knew who did it,
nobody gave a shit.

41:21.201 --> 41:23.201
And if one day, you get attacked,

41:23.401 --> 41:26.561
make sure you don't go to the cops.
You'll lose all our respect.

41:26.761 --> 41:29.361
We'll get revenge for you.
Understood?

42:39.681 --> 42:42.081
Are you OK?
Is there a problem?

42:43.281 --> 42:45.081
Don't you have to rehearse?

42:45.801 --> 42:48.201
Yes, but I wanted to know
if everything is OK.

42:48.921 --> 42:50.321
Everything's fine.

42:51.481 --> 42:53.721
Listen...
- Leave me alone.

43:24.561 --> 43:25.561
Hello?

43:25.761 --> 43:28.001
<i>Shit, I looked all over for you.
What you doing?</i>

43:28.201 --> 43:30.041
<i>I'm 'm town.
- In town?</i>

43:30.241 --> 43:32.281
<i>Come over.
We're all waiting. Hurry up!</i>

43:32.481 --> 43:33.881
OK, I'm coming.

43:47.001 --> 43:48.761
<i>You OK?</i>

43:48.961 --> 43:51.401
<i>Yeah. They leave me alone.</i>

43:51.601 --> 43:54.321
Good.
- Most of the guys here are OK.

43:55.441 --> 43:58.641
How are things on the outside?
- Nothing special, same old.

44:00.681 --> 44:02.041
Is mother OK?

44:02.761 --> 44:05.961
Yeah, she says hi.
Fatima too.

44:08.081 --> 44:11.121
Nassim,
I'm going to quit this life.

44:12.641 --> 44:13.801
What?

44:14.561 --> 44:16.081
Just like that?

44:18.041 --> 44:20.041
You're in love.
I can see it in your face.

44:21.041 --> 44:22.721
Got a new chick?

44:24.001 --> 44:26.521
I want to make something out of my life.
- Doing what?

44:27.161 --> 44:30.721
I don't know. Something with cars.
- You're going to steal cars?

44:31.481 --> 44:33.241
No, maybe be a mechanic.

44:33.441 --> 44:35.841
You want to own a garage?
- Why not?

44:36.041 --> 44:38.721
A real garage owner
with overalls and a cap.

44:38.921 --> 44:40.761
"Hello there. Hi."

44:46.161 --> 44:48.041
Seriously?
- Yeah.

44:51.001 --> 44:54.041
I know some guys
who can get you some cars to sell.

44:54.241 --> 44:56.681
You can meet Pitchy.
- I want an honest business.

44:56.881 --> 44:58.841
What, a nine to five?

44:59.041 --> 45:01.841
A tidy little life, something clean?

45:03.561 --> 45:06.921
Then claim welfare.
That's also honest and you earn more.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.441
I don't want to do this shit
my whole life.

45:10.921 --> 45:12.841
What?
You think I'm shit as well?

45:13.441 --> 45:15.481
I'm here for you, aren't I?

45:16.601 --> 45:18.561
If you become Flemish,
then what?

45:18.761 --> 45:20.001
Forget it.

45:23.441 --> 45:25.001
Listen up, bro.

45:25.201 --> 45:27.521
You were born here,
but you're still different.

45:27.721 --> 45:30.001
You'll always be a foreigner,
period.

45:56.361 --> 45:57.241
Hello?

45:57.441 --> 46:00.681
<i>X, get over here. Some sons of bitches
are loitering on our turf.</i>

46:10.081 --> 46:12.281
You see, it's chill.

46:13.361 --> 46:15.961
What are you doing?
- Gardening.

46:16.161 --> 46:19.401
<i>You're on our turf.
- Nah, this is Black Panthers' turf.</i>

46:19.601 --> 46:21.801
Didn't they tell you in lock up?

46:22.401 --> 46:24.321
This is our turf now.

46:25.761 --> 46:27.161
Look at the little guy.

46:27.361 --> 46:29.921
He's grown balls,
he's taller, he talks too much

46:30.121 --> 46:32.401
and he's starting
to threaten his superiors.

46:32.601 --> 46:33.841
You know what?

46:34.841 --> 46:36.161
Fuck off, you bitch.

46:37.001 --> 46:38.081
Bitch?

46:51.921 --> 46:54.641
Who's the bitch now?
Who?

46:55.321 --> 46:57.081
Let's go, man.

47:01.241 --> 47:04.801
<i>They've been in there
ever since the IRA attack in 2008.</i>

47:05.001 --> 47:08.441
<i>This war in this region started
almost 300 miles away,</i>

47:08.641 --> 47:11.321
<i>in Uganda, in the late 1980s.</i>

47:12.841 --> 47:16.401
<i>Since then, the scale of atrocities
has been apocalyptic.</i>

47:19.921 --> 47:22.881
<i>An estimated 100,000 people
have died in this conflict.</i>

47:23.081 --> 47:25.401
<i>More than 20,000 children
were abducted.</i>

47:45.561 --> 47:48.041
Where've you been?
- At my mom's.

47:49.441 --> 47:51.681
Where are the others?
- Gone out.

47:52.521 --> 47:54.081
Justelle's asleep.

48:04.801 --> 48:07.641
You're sure you were at your mom's?
- Yes.

48:12.001 --> 48:13.481
Are you lying?

48:14.201 --> 48:15.521
I swear.

48:33.561 --> 48:35.401
Loubna, pass me the joint.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.201
Loubna, pass me the joint.

48:43.081 --> 48:44.361
You OK?

48:44.561 --> 48:46.801
Sure?
You look like a zombie.

48:47.001 --> 48:48.641
Yeah.
- See?

48:51.601 --> 48:53.521
Oh, what an ass.
Hey, cute ass?

48:54.521 --> 48:56.641
Marwan, did you see?
- What?

48:56.841 --> 48:58.321
What's up with you?

48:58.521 --> 49:01.081
Now you're with Sindi,
you can't look at ass anymore?

49:01.281 --> 49:03.201
I do what I want.
She's not my mother.

49:03.401 --> 49:06.681
There's no more love?
- Love? There never was any.

49:06.881 --> 49:09.801
You've broken up?
Come on, what happened?

49:10.001 --> 49:11.961
You're not with her anymore?

49:12.161 --> 49:12.961
No.

49:13.801 --> 49:17.761
Then let me have her, for a night.
- She's all yours.

49:17.961 --> 49:19.441
Seriously?
- Yeah.

49:19.641 --> 49:22.801
Cool, man.
- Brothers share everything.

49:24.761 --> 49:26.521
The two buffoons are here.

49:28.321 --> 49:29.881
Everything OK?

49:32.161 --> 49:33.361
What's that?

49:33.881 --> 49:36.121
A present.
- I did a little something today.

49:36.321 --> 49:38.201
I stole it.
- You did what?

49:38.401 --> 49:41.121
It was me.
- You stole it?

49:41.321 --> 49:43.641
It was me that stole it.
Why you laughing?

49:43.841 --> 49:47.601
There's a cellphone. I want that.
We'll call mom tonight.

49:48.161 --> 49:50.361
In Morocco.
- Let's see that wallet.

49:50.561 --> 49:51.721
Wait.

49:52.641 --> 49:56.601
Are you serious? A 70 year-old grandma?
You fuckers.

49:56.801 --> 49:59.601
What?
- She is 70, you son of a bitch.

49:59.801 --> 50:02.081
Seriously?
You stole a bag from on old woman?

50:02.281 --> 50:04.321
You told me...
- Shut the fuck up.

50:04.521 --> 50:07.121
But he told me.
- Calm down, calm down.

50:07.761 --> 50:10.761
Since when are you so politically correct?
- Shut the fuck up.

50:10.961 --> 50:13.441
Since when do you use
words like that?

50:13.641 --> 50:16.601
I'm off, see what's happening.
- Are you moving?

50:16.801 --> 50:18.561
Get back here now.

50:20.001 --> 50:21.801
Fuck, that old one still looks good.

50:22.001 --> 50:23.481
Where's she going?

50:29.721 --> 50:32.361
What are you doing here?
- You left, so I thought...

50:32.561 --> 50:34.641
Where're the others?
- Still in Molenbeek.

50:36.321 --> 50:38.721
My parents aren't home
this weekend.

50:38.921 --> 50:40.281
Sindi, please.

50:41.481 --> 50:44.161
You don't want to fuck anymore?
Have you lost your balls?

50:44.361 --> 50:45.121
Stop it.

50:45.321 --> 50:47.641
Who's the fucking necklace for?
- No one.

50:47.841 --> 50:49.761
You found another slut?

50:51.121 --> 50:52.561
Fuck off.

50:54.041 --> 50:55.481
Bastard.

51:09.561 --> 51:12.121
I want to get far away from here, I swear.
- Me too.

51:12.321 --> 51:14.921
If you had to choose a destination,
which one?

51:15.121 --> 51:18.881
Ghent
- That's shithole. I'd choose Paris.

51:37.201 --> 51:38.441
Thank you.

51:38.641 --> 51:41.321
Wait, I'll go put it on.
Can I?

52:18.521 --> 52:20.121
Are you thirsty?

52:20.321 --> 52:22.601
I'm off to find something
in the night shop.

52:24.041 --> 52:25.281
Be quick.

52:57.521 --> 52:59.681
Waiting for someone?
- Why are you here?

52:59.881 --> 53:01.801
"Why are you here?"
What about you?

53:02.001 --> 53:05.041
Nothing.
- Nothing? That's funny, us too.

53:05.241 --> 53:07.761
<i>A Black Bronx chick doesn't fuck
outside the gang.</i>

53:10.361 --> 53:11.641
Fuck her.

53:12.841 --> 53:13.721
Do it!

53:16.321 --> 53:18.281
Shut it, bitch!

53:20.721 --> 53:22.001
Fuck.

53:24.881 --> 53:26.881
How's it going, Mina? Cheetos?

56:04.321 --> 56:06.201
Don't touch me.

56:08.281 --> 56:09.761
Calm down.

56:28.481 --> 56:30.601
<i>I want to leave the Black Bronx.</i>

56:41.641 --> 56:43.721
<i>You can't leave the Black Bronx.</i>

56:46.441 --> 56:49.481
I don't give a shit.
- It's for them to decide.

57:24.401 --> 57:25.841
Hi, beautiful.

57:26.321 --> 57:29.681
I thought you'd like it if
we went back together instead of alone.

57:31.561 --> 57:32.441
Let's go.

57:32.641 --> 57:34.361
Don, actually...
- What?

57:34.521 --> 57:36.321
Do you need to take something home?

57:36.521 --> 57:37.961
My mom?
- What about her?

57:38.161 --> 57:40.441
Enough about your mom,
leave her in peace.

57:40.641 --> 57:42.161
You want me to go and speak to her?

57:44.321 --> 57:45.881
Give me your cellphone.

57:54.881 --> 57:56.041
Come on.

58:21.881 --> 58:24.761
Read this and sign it.

58:27.721 --> 58:29.841
Sit down. Sit down!

58:31.281 --> 58:34.601
You're not getting off that easily.
I've warned you, Marwan.

58:35.321 --> 58:37.721
I'll make sure this was
the last time you've stolen.

58:37.921 --> 58:39.881
The last time, get it.

58:42.161 --> 58:43.521
You can go.

59:18.081 --> 59:19.321
Mavela?

59:20.841 --> 59:23.921
Mavela doesn't want to see you.
She's found someone else.

59:26.161 --> 59:28.521
Speak to her? No, I don't think so.

59:33.641 --> 59:35.001
Fuck!

59:41.241 --> 59:42.201
Mavela.

59:46.321 --> 59:47.681
Come here, I said.

59:56.361 --> 59:57.721
Sit down.

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:05.041
If you try and see
that Moroccan son of a bitch again.

01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:14.801
You know what I'll do to him?

01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:19.281
Got it?

01:00:33.641 --> 01:00:35.121
You bitch!

01:00:35.321 --> 01:00:37.401
It's your fault!
- Marwan, enough!

01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:40.201
It's OK.
Things will be fine. Calm down.

01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:41.761
What happened?

01:00:43.401 --> 01:00:45.801
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Marwan?

01:00:46.721 --> 01:00:48.721
They've got my girlfriend.
- Who has?

01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:52.601
<i>Her gang, the Black Bronx.
It's your fault, Mina.</i>

01:01:15.761 --> 01:01:16.961
So that's it?

01:01:17.161 --> 01:01:20.961
After everything I've done for you,
you want to go without saying goodbye?

01:01:23.481 --> 01:01:25.361
Leave her alone.

01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:47.801
Next time,

01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:49.201
watch out.

01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:51.841
Or we'll do the same thing
to your mom. Understand?

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.001
Or not?

01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:10.281
David.

01:03:35.281 --> 01:03:36.681
David, listen to me.

01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:41.601
If anything happens to Marie-Evelyne,
I'll kill you with my own hands.

01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.721
Whether you're family or not.

01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:48.281
You won't screw up her life
like you screwed up your mother's.

01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:50.641
Do you understand, you little shit?

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:05.481
There's nothing left to drink.

01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:09.641
I have an idea.

01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:19.321
Say sorry.

01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:21.721
Say sorry. Say sorry.

01:04:24.601 --> 01:04:26.161
Say sorry, you bitch.

01:04:26.801 --> 01:04:28.281
Didn't you owe us something?

01:04:55.361 --> 01:04:57.961
Give us the cash.

01:04:58.161 --> 01:04:59.921
Empty your register. Now!

01:05:07.801 --> 01:05:09.921
Quick. There's no time!

01:05:56.281 --> 01:05:57.281
Mavela!

01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:04.121
Please,
tell me what's happened, Mavela.

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:07.961
I haven't seen you for ages.

01:06:08.161 --> 01:06:09.561
I don't want to see you again.

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.761
Why won't you say anything?

01:06:27.081 --> 01:06:29.841
I love you.
What do I have to do to prove it?

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.121
Our room's been trashed.
What happened?

01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:36.161
No idea.

01:06:36.921 --> 01:06:39.521
Anyway, where were you?
- With the cops.

01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:41.841
Let me out.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.241
Not until you answer me.

01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:57.961
What are you doing?

01:07:04.081 --> 01:07:05.961
Marwan, you're insane!

01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:08.761
What happened, Mavela?
- Stop.

01:07:09.081 --> 01:07:11.081
I love you, OK?
- I don't love you!

01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:13.481
You're lying.
- Marwan, stop.

01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:16.801
Nobody, nothing will stop me
from being with you. I don't give a fuck!

01:07:24.961 --> 01:07:26.961
They raped Loubna.

01:07:42.281 --> 01:07:43.441
Who?

01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:47.641
My gang-

01:07:48.921 --> 01:07:51.161
I had to get her to the apartment.

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:54.441
You're lying. You didn't...

01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:56.561
Tell her I'm sorry.

01:07:58.681 --> 01:08:00.521
And I know what it's like.

01:08:45.001 --> 01:08:46.961
I have something to say.

01:08:50.401 --> 01:08:52.680
Our sister Mavela
has come back tonight.

01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:56.321
<i>She's shown everyone
that she's a real Black Bronx chick.</i>

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.961
Speech.

01:09:00.961 --> 01:09:02.401
Speech.

01:09:07.201 --> 01:09:08.361
<i>Black Bronx.</i>

01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:18.640
<i>Black Bronx for life.</i>

01:11:19.281 --> 01:11:21.241
<i>Hello?
- It's Mavela.</i>

01:11:21.441 --> 01:11:24.121
Hi, Mavela. Are you OK?

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:26.801
What's wrong?

01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:31.681
Want to come to the station
and tell me?

01:11:31.881 --> 01:11:34.361
<i>Are you crazy?
If they see me back there...</i>

01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.041
Nobody will see you.
Trust me.

01:12:01.281 --> 01:12:03.041
His name's Don.

01:12:08.881 --> 01:12:10.121
And this one?

01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:13.121
His name's Notorious.
- Notorious?

01:12:13.321 --> 01:12:15.441
He wasn't there during the rapes?

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.601
He wasn't there.

01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:26.761
When are you going to get them?

01:12:26.961 --> 01:12:29.241
Give me until tomorrow night.

01:12:29.441 --> 01:12:31.921
In the meantime, make sure
you're in X's apartment,

01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:33.721
so we can arrest you all together.

01:12:33.921 --> 01:12:35.281
I have to go back there?

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.681
These arrests
happen early in the morning.

01:12:37.881 --> 01:12:39.561
Why not right now?

01:12:39.761 --> 01:12:42.081
You all must be
in the same place at the same time

01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:45.361
and we arrest you with them,
so nobody suspects anything.

01:12:50.441 --> 01:12:53.961
Mavela, I'm asking you
to hold on a bit longer.

01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:56.521
And I swear to God
I'll get you out of there.

01:13:07.761 --> 01:13:08.961
Hello, Mr. Dominique.

01:13:09.281 --> 01:13:10.241
Hello.

01:13:14.241 --> 01:13:15.961
Well done, good work son.

01:13:16.161 --> 01:13:18.681
It's time to ramp things up a gear.

01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:21.441
I'll introduce you
to some important people.

01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:23.961
Now?
- Let's not waste any time.

01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:38.481
Thanks, Mr. Dominique.

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:42.601
You can trust me in future.
There won't be any more mistakes, I swear.

01:13:42.801 --> 01:13:44.001
I have some ideas.

01:13:44.561 --> 01:13:47.441
X, the guy you're going to meet
is like me.

01:13:47.641 --> 01:13:49.721
An African mafia boss.

01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:53.161
You need to show him
plenty of respect, understand?

01:13:53.361 --> 01:13:55.721
Of course, Mr. Dominique.
Of course.

01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:57.481
Hi, bitch!

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:15.721
What am I going to do?
I don't give a fuck.

01:14:15.921 --> 01:14:17.281
You got her pregnant...

01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:19.961
I knocked her up and then basta.

01:14:20.761 --> 01:14:24.401
I've already got another chick.
- I know. You're a prick.

01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:27.681
X, get up.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.201
Hey, son of a bitch.

01:14:29.401 --> 01:14:30.801
Who is it? Stop him.

01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.001
Stop filming.

01:14:34.681 --> 01:14:36.241
Call an ambulance, fuck.

01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:45.761
Go fuck yourself.

01:15:00.561 --> 01:15:02.841
How's it going, big man?
- You OK?

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:05.041
Fuck, you look good.
- Sweetheart.

01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:09.921
It's great to see you again.
- Thanks.

01:15:10.121 --> 01:15:11.801
A real criminal.

01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:14.641
You've grown.
- Go on, fly.

01:15:16.401 --> 01:15:19.361
What? You're not happy to see me?
- No, it's not that.

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:21.161
You've gained weight, bro.

01:15:21.361 --> 01:15:23.441
I knew you had a new girl.
What's going on?

01:15:23.641 --> 01:15:26.761
You swap them like undies.
- And him? He takes my leftovers.

01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:29.001
No, you're the bitch.

01:15:29.201 --> 01:15:32.161
You're a bitch.
- No, I'm not.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.081
Say it.
- OK, I'm a bitch.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.001
Shut the fuck up, you prick.

01:15:51.961 --> 01:15:53.241
Hey, bro.

01:15:53.641 --> 01:15:57.201
You know, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.521
You OK?

01:16:01.441 --> 01:16:04.561
Want me to take you home?
- OK.

01:16:09.921 --> 01:16:11.401
Want me to come too?

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.561
No.

01:16:26.441 --> 01:16:28.601
Chill, man.
- What do you mean, chill?

01:16:28.801 --> 01:16:31.161
What?
What's up?

01:16:31.361 --> 01:16:33.481
Don't worry, we'll get him.
Calm down.

01:16:33.681 --> 01:16:36.201
We'll get him, promise.
- Stop drinking like that.

01:16:39.241 --> 01:16:40.721
What's the problem?

01:17:01.761 --> 01:17:03.241
What's going on?

01:17:09.721 --> 01:17:11.521
Who's Mavela?

01:17:13.841 --> 01:17:14.801
Who is Mavela?

01:17:15.001 --> 01:17:17.161
Nassim, chill, man!

01:17:17.361 --> 01:17:19.321
Chill, man! Calm down.
- Who is she?

01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:22.641
What are you doing, man?
Leave him be.

01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:27.161
Stay out of it!

01:17:27.361 --> 01:17:30.081
Nassim, he's your brother!
Don't fuck around!

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.761
Fuck, Nassim!

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.961
Call your black bitch!
Go see her, now!

01:17:40.161 --> 01:17:41.761
Not tomorrow,
not next week,

01:17:41.961 --> 01:17:43.641
but now.
- No.

01:17:43.841 --> 01:17:46.801
I'll kill you if you don't do it.
See what I'm gonna do?

01:18:00.441 --> 01:18:02.001
Who is it?

01:18:06.441 --> 01:18:07.721
Show me.

01:18:08.801 --> 01:18:10.841
Pick up. Put him on speaker.

01:18:14.641 --> 01:18:15.801
Get a move on!

01:18:16.401 --> 01:18:19.201
Pick up. Do it now!

01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:25.161
Hello?

01:18:25.921 --> 01:18:28.641
Hi, Mavela, it's me, Marwan.
I want to see you.

01:18:31.561 --> 01:18:32.521
OK.

01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:36.961
North Station in 30 minutes.
- North Station in 30 minutes.

01:18:40.321 --> 01:18:41.481
I love you.

01:18:45.961 --> 01:18:48.601
What did I say if you saw
that Moroccan bastard again?

01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:51.001
You think I've got no balls?

01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:53.761
What did I fucking say?

01:18:55.041 --> 01:18:57.001
Let's go, move it!

01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:01.601
Stay here.

01:19:45.441 --> 01:19:46.881
Notorious...

01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:48.561
Watch her.

01:20:19.921 --> 01:20:21.361
Come here.

01:20:21.561 --> 01:20:24.521
You walk to the North Station.
We'll go by tram.

01:20:24.721 --> 01:20:26.721
Matti, follow him.
No bullshit.

01:20:26.921 --> 01:20:29.161
Do you understand me?
Now go.

01:20:39.521 --> 01:20:41.641
Notorious, please,
let me out.

01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:45.721
Notorious,
at least give me your cellphone.

01:20:45.921 --> 01:20:48.521
You know what's going to happen,
you can't do that.

01:20:50.081 --> 01:20:53.201
Think about our moms.
What they'll think of us.

01:20:54.281 --> 01:20:56.481
I'm begging you,
give me your cellphone.

01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:03.361
I'm begging you.

01:21:11.201 --> 01:21:13.121
Do what you have to do.

01:21:19.281 --> 01:21:22.681
Everyone knows this lot.
We've dealt with them many times before.

01:21:24.041 --> 01:21:25.361
Hello?

01:23:11.481 --> 01:23:13.561
Let me out!
- Fuck, it's too dangerous!

01:23:13.761 --> 01:23:15.881
Please. I know you.

01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:18.681
I know you're not a bad guy.
Let me get out.

01:23:18.881 --> 01:23:21.241
Think about our moms.
Yours, mine!

01:23:21.441 --> 01:23:24.481
Have you forgotten
you're the reason I'm here?

01:23:26.121 --> 01:23:28.881
Let me out
of the fucking car, now!

01:25:07.201 --> 01:25:09.481
We need an ambulance
at North Station!

01:25:11.721 --> 01:25:13.801
<i>Three wounded, quick!</i>

01:26:13.802 --> 01:26:17.802
