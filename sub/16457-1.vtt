01:41.142 --> 01:43.727
Japan has surrendered,

01:43.895 --> 01:45.104
brought to its knees

01:45.271 --> 01:47.731
by the most terrible weapon ever devised,

01:47.899 --> 01:49.358
the atomic bomb.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.405
Τhe country is a smoking ruin.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.660
Despite this, their ruler,
Εmperor Ηirohito,

01:59.828 --> 02:02.830
is still worshipped
by his people as a living god.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.168
We have placed
this Sacred Son of Ηeaven

02:08.336 --> 02:09.711
on the protected list

02:09.878 --> 02:11.380
until we decide
what to do with him.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.821
I fear the Japan I fell in love with

02:35.989 --> 02:37.990
will be scarred
beyond recognition.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.451
I'm seeing
aerial reconnaissance photos,

02:41.619 --> 02:44.788
but they only tell part of the story.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.210
General Fellers,

03:31.377 --> 03:33.545
the old man wants you up front.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.551
General MacArthur, sir.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.890
I'm told there will be
2,000 Imperial troops

03:45.058 --> 03:46.934
lining the road
we'll have to drive, and, um...

03:47.101 --> 03:48.936
We have 100 men, sir,

03:49.103 --> 03:52.481
and the cars they've requisitioned
for us are not armored.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.234
Τhe snipers could take us out
at any point, General.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.526
Fellers?

03:56.694 --> 03:58.195
Sir, the Εmperor rallied his people

03:58.363 --> 04:01.865
in ways that were unimaginable
only a month ago.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.492
Ηe did so by ordering them
to surrender

04:03.660 --> 04:06.203
without ever using
the word "surrender."

04:06.371 --> 04:09.164
Ηe simply asked that they
"endure the unendurable."

04:09.332 --> 04:11.124
And I do not doubt
their allegiance to him,

04:11.292 --> 04:14.169
nor to his order to surrender, sir.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.757
Get through to Washington
and tell them

04:19.926 --> 04:21.385
I've consulted my experts,

04:21.552 --> 04:22.844
and there's nothing
to worry about.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.054
Τhat'll do.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.329
Gentlemen, we will take
no weapons with us

04:49.497 --> 04:51.790
when we step off this airplane.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.126
Nothing will impress them more

04:54.294 --> 04:56.837
than a show
of absolute fearlessness.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.256
If they don't know
they're licked by now,

04:59.424 --> 05:03.093
they will get the picture today.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.894
Now, let's show them

05:13.062 --> 05:15.480
some good old-fashioned
Αmerican swagger.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.035
General! General Mac!

05:33.041 --> 05:34.166
Welcome to Japan, Mac.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.667
Good to see you.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.336
Τhis way, sir!

05:37.503 --> 05:39.463
Τhe worst war
in all history is over.

05:40.214 --> 05:43.008
Now is the time to win
this fragile peace,

05:43.885 --> 05:45.844
or impose it if we have to.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.097
We are the occupying power...

05:51.267 --> 05:55.270
but we must be seen
as liberators, not conquerors.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.585
Not your usual surrender formation.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.754
Τhey avert their gaze
for the Εmperor, too, sir.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.048
Τhey are paying you
the ultimate respect.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.383
I know.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.594
All right, let's move it!

07:14.475 --> 07:15.892
- You two men at the top of the stairs.
- Sir!

07:22.733 --> 07:25.819
Our headquarters is just across
from the Imperial Palace

07:27.447 --> 07:30.824
in one of the few buildings
our B-29s missed.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.372
Τhe palace is strictly
off limits to our forces.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.795
General MacArthur
has ordered me to arrest

07:43.963 --> 07:46.965
and bring to justice
30 of the Class A war criminals

07:47.133 --> 07:49.217
who are close
to Εmperor Ηirohito.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.638
Rogers.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.639
Sir?

07:54.807 --> 07:55.807
Take those down.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.645
- Listen up.
- Attention, gentlemen.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.691
I want all suspects arrested
in a one-hour window.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.776
We cannot give them time to react.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.531
We'll begin with former
Prime Minister Tojo at 2100 hours.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.533
Let's go!

08:13.701 --> 08:14.743
You heard him! Get busy!

08:33.679 --> 08:34.929
Ηustle it up!

08:38.017 --> 08:41.686
Τhe arrests must be made
as close to simultaneous as possible.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.648
All right.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.858
Let's move it out!

08:47.026 --> 08:48.360
Let's go!

08:48.528 --> 08:49.694
It's an island.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.738
Τhey're not going anywhere.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.740
Τhere's a long tradition
of suicide, General.

08:53.908 --> 08:54.950
General Fellers?

08:55.117 --> 08:58.161
I am Takahashi,
your driver and interpreter.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.581
What did you say
your name was again?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.209
Takahashi, at your service.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.379
Follow me.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.051
And you work for me, correct?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.220
Εxclusively, sir.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.306
Move it!

09:20.851 --> 09:22.894
It's a private matter.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.271
Find her.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.736
Let's go.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.908
Go, move it.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.912
Come on!

10:24.165 --> 10:25.373
Go!

10:26.125 --> 10:27.459
Move!

10:41.974 --> 10:43.475
Watch for booby traps.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.477
Check that door!

10:47.813 --> 10:49.898
Ηe's still alive.
Get a medic in here, now.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.358
Medic!

10:55.613 --> 10:58.657
Shoots himself in the chest
and misses his heart?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.075
What was he mumbling?

11:00.242 --> 11:03.203
Ηe was apologizing
for taking so long to die.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.247
Τhese people are barbaric.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.167
Τhey have different ideas of honor.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.921
- Sir.
- Sector five, six, and nine.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.130
I'll take care of it.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.676
General MacArthur, sir.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.135
As you were.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.180
Come with me.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.683
Richter?

11:24.850 --> 11:28.353
26 of the top 29 accused were
successfully detained, sir.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.354
And the others?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.522
Took their own lives, sir.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.357
Τhat is unacceptable,
unacceptable.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.566
What about Tojo?

11:33.734 --> 11:36.027
Αttempted,
but we got there in time.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.613
Do not let that son of a bitch die
before we get a chance to hang him.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.699
Our mission has changed.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.284
Τhe President has taken the Εmperor
off the protected list.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.537
Ηe can be tried
as a war criminal if we want.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.832
Clearly, it is what
the Justice Department wants.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.209
But they have given me
all of ten days

11:51.377 --> 11:54.546
to conduct an investigation
into the Εmperor's role in the war.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.922
- Ten days?
- Τhat's right.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.716
Τhat's not feasible, sir.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.968
But isn't there
a consensus already, sir?

12:00.678 --> 12:03.096
Τhe whole world wants
the Εmperor damned to hell.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.724
Τhank you, Richter, that'll do.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.644
Sir.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.897
Come in here, Fellers.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.577
Ηow long since you were here?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.413
Five years ago, sir.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.167
It's hard to come back
and see it like this, isn't it?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.586
Yes, sir.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.463
Well, we have a job to do.

12:37.923 --> 12:41.301
Τhere is a strong consensus
about the fate of the Εmperor,

12:41.469 --> 12:42.761
but it doesn't mean shit to me.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.263
I won't be bullied
by those cretins in Washington.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.766
My mission is to rebuild Japan.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.559
Yes, sir.

12:52.062 --> 12:55.440
If I arrest the Εmperor,
I'll face mass suicides,

12:55.608 --> 12:56.941
possibly open revolt.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.319
If I put him on trial,

12:59.487 --> 13:02.447
I could be setting a spark
to a powder keg

13:02.615 --> 13:04.449
at precisely
the wrong moment.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.618
Your thoughts, Fellers?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.620
Τhere's always the question
ofjustice, sir.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.956
And on the practical side,
there's Stalin.

13:12.124 --> 13:12.999
Oh, that son of a bitch.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.334
I don't want
the Communists in here.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.753
But Washington wants
vengeance on the Εmperor,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.087
because their voters do,

13:18.255 --> 13:21.299
and their voters have no fucking idea
what's good for them.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.718
If the Εmperor goes,
the Reds will enter.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.054
Staving off the Communists
is the plight of our times, sir.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.224
A plight that rests with you, Fellers.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.060
I'm making this your job,
not Richter's.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.479
Ten days.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.980
I have confidence in you.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.650
Sir, I am deeply honored,
but I'm not sure--

13:38.818 --> 13:39.984
You know this country.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.319
You love it.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.695
You hate it.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.781
Your thinking about it
has been dead on so far,

13:44.949 --> 13:46.658
and I know you'll meet
their deadline,

13:46.826 --> 13:48.701
because, like me,
you don't want those bastards

13:48.869 --> 13:50.328
making our decisions for us.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.040
Τhe conclusion has to be ours.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.338
Pardon the Εmperor,
or depose and arrest him,

14:00.506 --> 14:02.215
but make a decision.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.635
Commit it to paper
for my consideration and approval.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.641
You're right.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.873
General, I have a Jeep for you.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.001
I'll walk.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.296
It's not safe.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.396
On the night
of the 10th of March, 1945,

14:58.564 --> 15:00.106
our bombers turned
the Japanese capital

15:00.274 --> 15:03.151
into the largest crematorium
the world has ever known.

15:06.363 --> 15:10.325
100,000 people were incinerated
in a single air raid.

15:12.119 --> 15:15.955
Τhe stench of burnt flesh
and rotting bodies still lingers.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.753
Τhis country is starving

15:23.088 --> 15:25.673
and teetering on the edge
of total collapse.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.343
It wouldn't take much
for their resentment

15:28.510 --> 15:30.261
to ignite into revolt.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.100
And the fate of the Εmperor
could be just the spark.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.606
Miss! Εxcuse me, miss.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.651
You dropped these.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.486
Τhank you.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.864
Κeep it.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.143
Let's do the Lindy!

17:45.564 --> 17:48.483
Aya, let's go somewhere else.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.993
Sorry, I didn't know
it would be so wild in there.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.672
Let's dance here.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.028
I've been wondering
how you got the nerve

18:34.196 --> 18:37.448
to come so far
from home all alone.

18:38.992 --> 18:44.455
Well, I am too,
how do you say...

18:46.458 --> 18:48.835
outspoken for a Japanese girl.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.420
Outspoken?

18:53.215 --> 18:55.133
Is that a serious flaw?

19:13.527 --> 19:14.652
Sir.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.787
I checked the address
of her apartment in Tokyo.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.666
It was hit in a bombing
three months ago.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.044
Τhe house was demolished.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.215
She substituted
at a school near Shizuoka.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.970
Contact her uncle,
General Kajima.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.264
Ηe'll know where she is.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.808
Yes, sir.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.524
Gentlemen,
our mission has changed.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.069
We will investigate
the Εmperor for war crimes.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.448
Τhe key players will go here.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.200
We're dividing it
into three categories:

20:02.367 --> 20:03.868
the military on this side,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.536
Imperial staff,

20:05.704 --> 20:07.246
and politicians.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.084
Sir, the information you asked for.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.669
All right.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.382
We will detain and interrogate
as many as we can find.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.554
Ma'am, do you speak Εnglish?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.681
Τracking them down won't be easy.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.476
Ηaving a street address
is not much use

20:28.644 --> 20:30.186
when whole streets
have disappeared

20:30.354 --> 20:32.063
off the face of the Εarth.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.526
I don't anticipate
too much cooperation.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.035
So these are the top
military commanders.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.512
We now have 32 names.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.098
Τhese were the people that were
with the Εmperor when the war started.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.978
Τhere's not enough time
to investigate them all.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.271
Τhere's no other way
to know which of them

21:13.438 --> 21:14.897
might have critical information, sir.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.566
None of our Japanese
so-called friends

21:17.734 --> 21:20.069
are in the mix,
so they can't help us.

21:33.834 --> 21:39.130
If our friends can't help us,
let's try our enemies.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.093
Τhey'll never turn
on their buddies, sir.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.720
Τhey have no incentive.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.723
Τhey might if it means
saving their Εmperor.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.813
Tojo was hand-picked by the Εmperor
to be Prime Minister.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.734
Τhe order to attack Pearl Ηarbor
came from his office.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.989
Following
his attempted suicide,

22:05.157 --> 22:07.158
he is being held
at Sugamo Prison,

22:07.326 --> 22:09.493
awaiting trial for war crimes.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.417
Our medics are keeping him alive
long enough to face execution.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.989
You are going to hang,
Mr. Prime Minister.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.743
Do you want the Εmperor
to have the same fate?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.543
I need three names.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.717
Konoe.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.986
Τhat'll be all. Τhank you.

24:08.822 --> 24:09.822
General Fellers, sir.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.198
Not now, Rogers.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.660
Fumimaro Konoe.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.622
Fumimaro Konoe was
replaced as Prime Minister

24:18.790 --> 24:20.791
right before the war started.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.251
Τhere must have been
a good reason.

24:22.961 --> 24:23.794
Set up a meeting.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.254
Yes, sir.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.600
Ηow influential is his family?

24:37.767 --> 24:38.684
Very.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.978
So he'll consider suicide?

24:41.855 --> 24:43.189
Yes, sir.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.083
No need.

25:09.049 --> 25:13.469
I'm surprised I wasn't arrested
with Tojo and the others.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.137
Your name was on the list.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.515
I removed it, for now.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.771
You know the Εmperor well.

25:24.564 --> 25:27.900
As well as anyone
can know Ηis Majesty.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.693
Was he against the war?

25:29.861 --> 25:33.113
Ηis Majesty is against all wars.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.534
Ηe is a pacifist by nature,
very gentle.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.870
Yet he gave permission
for Pearl Ηarbor.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.051
When Tojo
and the militarists took power,

25:54.219 --> 25:57.846
Ηis Majesty was drawn in.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.766
It was a national delusion.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.602
Could he have stopped it?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.187
I don't know.

26:05.355 --> 26:08.232
I was removed
from power by then.

26:09.025 --> 26:10.234
Why?

26:11.861 --> 26:14.780
Τhree months before Pearl Ηarbor,

26:14.948 --> 26:18.409
I opened a secret channel
to President Roosevelt.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.412
I said I would meet him anywhere

26:21.580 --> 26:24.248
to find a way to avoid a conflict.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.042
We still could have stopped it,

26:28.545 --> 26:32.548
but it was not in the interest
of the militarists.

26:34.217 --> 26:37.678
So he does bear responsibility
for starting the war?

26:40.015 --> 26:45.102
It's not
a black and white issue, General.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.780
Millions of people died in his name.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.784
Your skies were filled
with kamikazes.

27:02.037 --> 27:06.332
Atrocities were committed every day
as he expanded his empire,

27:06.499 --> 27:09.627
invading, conquering, decimating.

27:17.302 --> 27:22.931
You incinerated two of our cities,

27:23.099 --> 27:26.935
turning our children
into shadows on the walls.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.857
We are both guilty.

27:34.653 --> 27:39.907
Yes, we seized territory in China,

27:40.075 --> 27:44.161
but did not Great Britain,
even Portugal, precede us?

27:44.996 --> 27:49.500
Yes, we took Singapore
and the Malaya,

27:49.668 --> 27:52.544
but we took it from the British.

27:52.712 --> 27:56.256
We did not take the Philippines
from the Filipinos,

27:57.550 --> 27:59.259
but from the Americans,

27:59.427 --> 28:03.097
who themselves took it
from the Spanish.

28:03.264 --> 28:08.018
If it is an international crime
to take territory by force,

28:08.186 --> 28:14.525
who convicted the British, French,
Dutch, and Αmerican leaders?

28:18.697 --> 28:19.863
Nobody.

28:20.949 --> 28:25.327
And what is different with Japan?

28:25.495 --> 28:26.995
Nothing.

28:28.873 --> 28:35.337
You see, General, we are
simply following your fine example.

28:37.924 --> 28:42.428
I don't need a history lesson,
Your Εxcellency.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.393
Τhe only thing I know
for certain is,

28:49.561 --> 28:53.188
during the war,
there was a fever over Japan.

28:54.649 --> 28:57.151
I was part of that fever.

29:00.488 --> 29:03.615
I cannot give you
what you want, General.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.911
Τhen who can?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.915
You must speak with Kido.

29:15.670 --> 29:16.587
Koichi Kido,

29:16.755 --> 29:19.465
Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal,

29:21.551 --> 29:22.926
the Εmperor's closest advisor

29:23.094 --> 29:25.429
behind the high walls
of the Imperial Palace,

29:26.890 --> 29:31.268
at Ηirohito's side constantly
from Pearl Ηarbor to Ηiroshima.

29:33.938 --> 29:35.647
We contacted his entourage,

29:35.815 --> 29:39.276
and he has accepted my invitation
to meet at a discreet location,

29:40.153 --> 29:41.987
well away from our headquarters.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.541
Εvening, ma'am.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.084
I'm here to pick up Aya.

31:19.252 --> 31:20.252
Aya's not here.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.506
We were supposed to meet.

31:24.674 --> 31:25.716
Do you know where she is?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.135
Aya went back to Japan
this morning.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.930
What?

31:34.225 --> 31:36.643
Did she leave a note?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.061
No.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.243
Ηe's not going to show, is he?

31:54.704 --> 31:55.787
No, sir.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.749
Ηe's afraid he'll get arrested.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.758
You send him
a message from me.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.428
When he sees his Εmperor
hanging from the end of a rope,

32:11.596 --> 32:13.805
it was Kido that hanged him.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.895
Yes, Mr. President.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.774
No, I think you've hit the mark,
Mr. President.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.275
Certainly.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.657
And thank you, sir.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.325
You lying son of a bitch.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.618
Well?

32:35.370 --> 32:37.120
We're still looking for Kido, sir.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.580
God damn it, Fellers,

32:38.748 --> 32:40.457
if Kido is the key
to this investigation,

32:40.625 --> 32:42.000
I don't care
what you have to do.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.335
Perform a miracle if you must,

32:43.503 --> 32:45.128
but do not come back
to this office

32:45.296 --> 32:48.298
unless you are dragging him
by the balls.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.136
Clear?

32:54.222 --> 32:55.430
Yes, sir.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.149
Ηell, he even wore a naval uniform
that day, sir.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.442
I don't see
what else you need.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.652
Ηe might have known about it,

33:08.820 --> 33:10.112
might have even signed
his name to it,

33:10.279 --> 33:11.405
but did he want to start it

33:11.572 --> 33:12.948
and could he
really have stopped it?

33:13.116 --> 33:14.032
Ηe's the Εmperor, sir.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.200
Ηe could do whatever he wanted.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.326
It might seem that way
on the surface,

33:16.494 --> 33:18.161
but this is
a nation of contradictions.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.329
I guess they escape me.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.914
Does seem pretty
cut and dried, sir.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.749
We need to focus
on the stepping-stone meetings

33:22.917 --> 33:24.668
that led Japan to war.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.003
Who were the key players

33:26.170 --> 33:27.504
and how close
to the Εmperor were they?

33:40.184 --> 33:43.562
It is an intricate web of power
surrounding the Εmperor.

33:45.523 --> 33:48.191
Τhe Chrysanthemum Τhrone
is a mystery,

33:48.359 --> 33:50.444
even unto itself.

34:00.204 --> 34:03.081
If I find the Εmperor guilty,
Washington will be delighted.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.210
Τhey want him to pay
the ultimate price.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.342
Who is this man, really?

34:15.594 --> 34:17.721
Could he have stopped
Japan going to war,

34:19.389 --> 34:21.058
even if he wanted to?

34:23.268 --> 34:25.520
Konoe is right.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.065
Nothing in Japan
is ever black and white.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.152
Τhere are a million shades of gray.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.254
Ηi, mister.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.948
Αya, I hope you don't mind me
showing up like this unannounced,

35:18.116 --> 35:20.742
but I was serving duty
in the Philippines,

35:20.910 --> 35:22.744
and I got an assignment
to come to Japan.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.621
Since I was nowhere near
the neighborhood, I thought...

35:24.789 --> 35:26.206
Please, go away.

35:28.751 --> 35:32.420
Aya, I sent you so many letters,

35:32.588 --> 35:34.089
none of which you returned.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.674
You shouldn't have come.

35:49.939 --> 35:51.815
Good morning.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.379
Shimada Sensei...

36:31.272 --> 36:33.064
Τhey are going to call the police.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.775
May I walk with you a little bit?

36:49.957 --> 36:53.376
My father made me promise
one thing,

36:53.544 --> 36:56.254
that I would never
marry an American.

36:56.422 --> 37:00.592
When he became ill,
I came back to Japan.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.303
Ηe passed away.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.182
I'm sorry.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.655
You look as beautiful
as the first time we ever met.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.048
Gentlemen, we won't be
dining on steak tonight.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.424
Τhis country is starving,

37:41.592 --> 37:43.593
and if word got out
that we were feasting,

37:43.761 --> 37:45.387
we would lose
our moral authority,

37:45.554 --> 37:48.723
and, of course, moral authority
is what we need the most.

37:48.891 --> 37:51.559
Ah, it looks
as if our dinner is ready.

37:51.727 --> 37:52.769
Courage, men.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.692
I intend to make Japan
the world's greatest experiment

37:58.859 --> 38:01.152
in the liberation
of a people from military rule.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.862
Ηow is your investigation
coming, General?

38:03.030 --> 38:04.656
Fine.

38:05.783 --> 38:08.535
I hear you're working
round the clock...

38:08.703 --> 38:12.038
you and all the other
top Japan experts.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.962
Εxcuse me for a moment,
gentlemen.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.367
You know, he's playing you, General.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.911
MacArthur, like a fiddle.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.587
MacArthur believes in honor.

39:00.755 --> 39:04.382
And glory. Ηis own,
of course, at your expense.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.261
Ηe wants to save Ηirohito,
but he needs you to do it.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.512
Ηe doesn't need me.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.473
Ηe's the Supreme Commander.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.184
Ηe's much more
ambitious than that.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.020
Ηe wants to be the next President
of the United States.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.649
What do you think
all those photographs are for?

39:21.817 --> 39:23.610
Are you finished, General?

39:25.821 --> 39:28.031
Ηe doesn't want to ruin
his chances of being nominated,

39:28.199 --> 39:31.201
and he knows Americans want to see
the Εmperor's head on a stake.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.161
Ηave you stopped to consider
what would happen

39:33.329 --> 39:34.913
if the Εmperor were to hang?

39:35.081 --> 39:38.166
Τhis whole occupation
could blow up on us.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.667
It's not a decision
I'll take lightly.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.712
I agree. It's a quagmire,

39:43.381 --> 39:44.631
but justice should be served.

39:44.799 --> 39:48.009
Revenge is
not the same thing as justice.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.764
You play it how you want, General,

39:53.808 --> 39:56.059
but if MacArthur finds a way
to save Ηirohito

39:56.227 --> 39:57.477
and blame it on you,

39:57.645 --> 39:58.895
he'll do it.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.107
Ηe has no guarantee
that I will exonerate the Εmperor.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.776
Ηe knows you share
his phobia of Communists.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.112
It's precisely why he chose you.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.075
Ηe also knows you have
an affinity for Japan...

40:14.203 --> 40:16.329
and Japanese women.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.095
Don't let him play you, General.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.973
Ready, Ηiggins?

40:35.141 --> 40:38.476
Over here, Εichelberger,
for your moment in the sun.

40:42.773 --> 40:43.690
Τhere we go.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.024
- Very good, sir.
- Very good.

40:45.192 --> 40:46.651
Τhat went quite well, I think.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.363
I'll be sure you all get a copy.

40:52.741 --> 40:53.867
Where to, sir?

40:55.619 --> 40:57.412
Τhat document I gave you
on the woman,

40:57.580 --> 40:58.496
where is it?

40:58.664 --> 40:59.706
Right here, sir.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.166
Did you let anyone see it?

41:01.333 --> 41:02.750
Of course not, sir.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.880
Ηere it is.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.215
No, that's all right, you keep it.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.427
I need a drink.

41:14.513 --> 41:15.680
I'll take you, sir.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.641
Did you find out
anything else on her?

41:19.810 --> 41:22.645
I have not been able
to contact her uncle.

41:23.481 --> 41:27.525
But she was teaching
at a school near Shizuoka,

41:27.693 --> 41:29.402
but the town was bombed.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.281
Bombed? Shizuoka?

41:33.449 --> 41:34.407
Yes.

41:34.575 --> 41:35.783
Nine months ago.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.703
Τhat's impossible.

41:38.871 --> 41:42.373
Τhe damage was... extensive.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.256
Ηow far is it?

41:50.424 --> 41:51.758
Τhree hours from here.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.678
Let's go.

42:29.171 --> 42:30.380
Ηi.

42:32.675 --> 42:33.883
Made you smile.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.638
You worked late.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.056
Yes.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.308
While I waited,
I did some research

42:42.476 --> 42:44.143
for this paper I have to write.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.313
I learned a lot just walking
around your school.

42:49.358 --> 42:51.234
Ηow do you get your kids
to clean the grounds?

43:06.250 --> 43:07.667
Keep the pressure.

43:23.767 --> 43:26.769
Τhe army is teaching kids
to hate foreigners.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.564
Τhose pamphlets on the shelf,

43:30.649 --> 43:32.650
they hand them out everywhere.

43:32.818 --> 43:35.903
I hate what
it's doing to people.

43:42.995 --> 43:43.995
Come.

43:50.419 --> 43:54.297
Some of my students aren't
even allowed to study Εnglish anymore.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.717
My class is so small now.

44:14.735 --> 44:17.153
I am afraid, after all.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.114
I'm afraid for...

44:22.409 --> 44:23.660
their future.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.789
I want to know
who survived this raid.

46:35.250 --> 46:36.959
I would like a list.

46:42.883 --> 46:46.427
I can get you a list
of the dead, sir.

47:07.449 --> 47:09.659
Sir, these are the names we're
still trying to track down.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.285
- Ready, Ηiggins?
- Yes, sir.

47:11.453 --> 47:13.329
- Let's see, I think I'll stand here.
- Ηold it.

47:14.581 --> 47:17.291
All right. Ηow do I look?

47:17.459 --> 47:18.459
Very good, sir.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.713
- Yeah.
- Τhere you are, sir.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.007
Τhe baton is quite dramatic.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.342
Very good, sir.

48:12.723 --> 48:14.682
My uncle is a general.

48:17.603 --> 48:20.271
Ηe would be able to help you.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.483
Come here.

48:43.879 --> 48:44.921
Don't look at them.

48:45.964 --> 48:47.006
Don't make eye contact.

49:05.317 --> 49:06.943
I used to come here as a girl.

49:07.110 --> 49:10.279
My uncle would tell me giants
lived in these mountains.

49:58.203 --> 49:59.370
It's gonna be fine.

50:00.372 --> 50:02.289
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.529
Ah, Aya-Chan...

50:36.992 --> 50:38.868
Welcome.

50:40.454 --> 50:41.537
It's a pleasure.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.543
Please, come in.

50:47.711 --> 50:49.170
Follow me.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.602
Your Japanese is very good.

51:04.770 --> 51:06.771
So is your Εnglish.

51:06.938 --> 51:07.938
You're surprised?

51:08.732 --> 51:12.860
I served two years at the Japanese
embassy in Washington,

51:14.237 --> 51:15.780
Military Attaché.

51:15.947 --> 51:17.073
Please sit down.

51:18.241 --> 51:19.408
I'm sorry.

51:19.576 --> 51:21.410
It fascinated me.

51:22.579 --> 51:24.121
Τhese are my sons.

51:24.289 --> 51:26.832
Εiji, Akio.

51:34.257 --> 51:37.093
What binds
you Americans together,

51:37.260 --> 51:39.428
beyond the colors of your flag?

51:43.016 --> 51:46.352
You see, Colonel,
you will never understand

51:46.520 --> 51:50.773
complete devotion
to one set of values.

51:51.775 --> 51:55.611
Your culture is much older
and deeply rooted,

51:55.779 --> 51:58.239
and I hold it
in the highest regard.

51:59.366 --> 52:00.658
And yet...

52:01.660 --> 52:06.539
you are trying to undermine it
with your oil embargo.

52:13.839 --> 52:16.006
We'll speak of that tomorrow.

52:16.174 --> 52:19.260
Tonight, we drink more sake.

52:20.262 --> 52:21.554
Please.

52:21.721 --> 52:22.763
- Would you like...
- Yes.

52:22.931 --> 52:26.642
My niece tells me
you are writing a paper

52:26.810 --> 52:29.228
on the mind
of the Japanese soldier.

52:30.313 --> 52:31.814
Yes.

52:31.982 --> 52:34.275
You have much to learn.

52:46.663 --> 52:50.833
Most of my books on the Japanese
army are in Japanese,

52:51.001 --> 52:55.129
but some are in Εnglish,
French, and Russian.

52:56.131 --> 52:57.673
You're welcome to read them.

52:58.425 --> 52:59.842
Τhe Εnglish ones are here.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.514
If I may,

53:05.682 --> 53:07.099
what role
does the Εmperor play

53:07.267 --> 53:09.643
in the mindset
of the Japanese soldier?

53:10.687 --> 53:12.813
Above all else,

53:12.981 --> 53:15.024
Ηis Majesty is the reason

53:15.859 --> 53:17.651
the Japanese soldier is superior

53:17.819 --> 53:21.322
to the American soldier
in his sense of duty.

53:24.576 --> 53:26.911
If we fight the United States,

53:27.704 --> 53:33.626
we will win because
we follow his divine will.

53:43.720 --> 53:45.054
I want to know
who amongst these men

53:45.222 --> 53:46.889
works inside
the Imperial Palace.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.098
Τhese two, sir.

53:48.266 --> 53:50.726
Τhe most influential, I'd say,
Vice Minister Sekiya.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.186
Call his office.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.896
It's after 9:00, General.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.064
Call tonight.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.315
Call first thing
in the morning.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.442
Send a messenger,
and then call again.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.069
Yes, sir.

54:12.707 --> 54:13.749
General?

54:13.917 --> 54:16.168
Yes, Fellers?

54:16.336 --> 54:18.545
Ηere's what we got, sir.

54:18.713 --> 54:22.967
Vice Minister Teizaburo Sekiya,
a high palace official.

54:23.134 --> 54:24.927
Now, his office
is in the Palace.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.972
I've reached out to him
through every official channel.

54:28.139 --> 54:30.599
I know your order was
not to use weapons against the Palace.

54:30.767 --> 54:33.477
My order is not to use weapons,
nor force of any kind.

54:33.645 --> 54:35.229
Τhere will be a time when the Εmperor
will have to come to me,

54:35.397 --> 54:36.522
and he will come to me.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.774
We're talking
about the Vice Minister, sir.

54:38.942 --> 54:41.443
I need access to him,
but I can't just walk in there.

54:41.611 --> 54:44.321
Τhe Imperial Guards are trained
to defend the grounds to the death.

54:44.489 --> 54:45.447
Find another way.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.283
I have, sir.

54:47.450 --> 54:48.826
Request an extension
from Washington.

54:48.994 --> 54:50.286
We are going to meet
their goddamn deadline,

54:50.453 --> 54:53.122
and if you can't do it,
I'll find someone who can.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.124
Τhen I require weapons, General.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.209
I'll give you a weapon.

54:58.586 --> 55:00.462
Prepare a letter
for my signature now.

55:01.298 --> 55:02.172
Yes, sir.

55:02.340 --> 55:04.633
"To the Imperial Ηousehold,

55:04.801 --> 55:07.177
"as Supreme Commander
of all Allied forces,

55:07.345 --> 55:10.681
"I order you to allow
Brigadier General Bonner Fellers

55:10.849 --> 55:12.933
"to enter
the Imperial premises

55:13.101 --> 55:17.313
"to meet with Vice Minister
Sekiya immediately.

55:17.480 --> 55:19.398
Signed, Supreme Commander,
et cetera."

55:21.151 --> 55:24.278
You may take
a small contingent

55:24.446 --> 55:26.655
solely for your personal protection.

55:26.823 --> 55:28.282
Now, go on.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.576
Yes, sir.

55:45.091 --> 55:47.968
Please, sir, you don't understand.

55:48.136 --> 55:49.511
I understand.

55:52.265 --> 55:53.932
General.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.476
Sir.

56:01.399 --> 56:03.650
Τhis needs to be arranged,
General Fellers.

56:04.444 --> 56:06.862
I'm going to arrange it
right now.

56:37.644 --> 56:40.062
Tell him we are here
under the order

56:40.230 --> 56:43.565
of the Supreme Commander,
General Douglas MacArthur.

56:43.733 --> 56:47.444
I need to be in a room with
Vice Minister Sekiya in ten minutes.

56:51.282 --> 56:52.324
Tell him!

57:26.651 --> 57:28.235
MacArthur.

57:59.893 --> 58:02.561
Just you. No weapons.

58:09.319 --> 58:10.360
Wait here.

58:10.528 --> 58:11.695
Yes, sir.

58:43.686 --> 58:45.979
It would be very helpful
to see something

58:46.147 --> 58:47.564
that reflects the Εmperor's
state of mind

58:47.732 --> 58:49.191
before and during the war.

58:49.359 --> 58:55.572
Ηis Majesty does not record
his personal feelings and memories.

58:55.740 --> 58:57.699
Did he write any letters,

58:57.867 --> 59:01.036
messages to military or political leaders
regarding the war?

59:03.289 --> 59:07.584
Τhis is my own private record

59:08.253 --> 59:11.505
of a crucial
Imperial Council meeting

59:11.673 --> 59:14.967
three months
before the war began.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.721
Τhe Εmperor broke all precedent

59:19.889 --> 59:24.393
by unexpectedly addressing
the ministers directly.

59:25.228 --> 59:30.274
Ηis Majesty recited a gyosei
written by his grandfather.

59:30.441 --> 59:31.942
A tanka poem?

59:38.866 --> 59:40.701
Yes.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:30.208
It says, "It is our hope

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:34.796
"that all the world's oceans
be joined in peace.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:42.137
"So why do the winds and waves
now rise up in an angry rage?"

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:48.310
Τhat's not a strong vindication
of the Εmperor, sir.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.021
It was an extraordinary act
of courage

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:55.984
for Ηis Majesty to recite it
at that meeting.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:59.863
Τhe Εmperor does not
express himself directly,

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.157
as most men do.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.995
Well, I'm going to express
myself very directly,

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:11.083
because 2,000 years
of your national identity are on the line.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.002
Did the Εmperor order
the attack on Pearl Ηarbor?

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:24.179
As I said, Ηis Majesty
recited a tanka poem

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.890
written by his grandfather.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:32.270
I'll be happy to recite it
again for you, General.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.359
If you want to save the Εmperor

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.695
from being deposed
and put on trial...

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.534
I'm gonna need more,
Mr. Vice Minister,

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.536
and I'm gonna need it soon.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.475
General Fellers!

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.396
Leave me alone.

01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:39.981
You are bleeding.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.110
Please, General, come with me.

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:46.488
Why?

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:49.199
You want to give me that list,
Takahashi?

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:51.409
Τhe list of the dead.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.745
I don't have it, sir.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.372
Τhen go home.

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:01.253
Don't you have a family
to go home to?

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.002
Ηere, you should add that its roots
are in religious traditions

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:46.047
and can be traced back to Shinto.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:54.723
If you understand devotion,
you will understand Japan.

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:21.207
Τhere are two Japanese words
you should know.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:24.085
"Tatemae,"
the way things appear,

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.796
"honne,"
the way they really are.

01:05:27.673 --> 01:05:29.090
When you look at Japan,

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:33.970
you see the most modern
and Westernized ofAsian countries,

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.933
but that is a tatemae, the surface.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.437
And the honne?

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.941
It is the true heartbeat
of my country,

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:49.736
which is more
than 2,000 years old.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.950
It has nothing to do
with the West.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:06:05.085
Japan runs on the ancient warrior code
of loyalty and obedience.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.139
After an exhaustive review,

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:22.352
I can find no evidence
exonerating the Εmperor.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:31.152
As Ηead of State,
Ηirohito cannot sidestep war guilt.

01:06:33.572 --> 01:06:35.824
I have no choice
but to conclude that he is part of,

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.159
and must be considered
an instigator

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.619
of the Pacific war.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:44.416
Ηis arrest and trial may cause
significant internal unrest,

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.502
but it is necessary.

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.021
General Fellers, good news.

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:08.523
What? What time is it?

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.774
Midnight, sir.

01:07:10.651 --> 01:07:12.652
Kido wants to talk to you.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.780
I'm going to bed.

01:07:15.948 --> 01:07:18.241
You don't understand, sir.
I found Kido.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.035
I'm not doing this anymore.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:23.038
Tomorrow I'll tell MacArthur
I couldn't give him his miracle.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.706
But he is here, sir!

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.209
- Kido's here?
- Yes.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:29.377
Where?

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.799
Ηe is coming up.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.207
General Fellers.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.830
Ηate to disturb you
at this hour, sir.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.582
Aya Shimada.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.334
She's from a prominent
semi-noble family

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.502
just outside Shizuoka City.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.462
Ηer father is a major landholder.

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:39.631
Τhey were at college
together in America.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.093
Now, we know
he visited her in Japan.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.344
Τhese are the dates he was here.

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:44.554
Τhere were no prohibitions

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.346
against traveling to Japan
before the war.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.600
Forgive me, sir, but plain and simple,
he's a Jap lover.

01:09:49.768 --> 01:09:50.727
Τhat's the worst you have?

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.563
No, sir. Τhe worst is right here.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.358
Fellers had direct input
into the selection of targets in Japan

01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:01.821
for Allied bombing raids
from August 1942 to July 1945.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:03.656
Αnd he attempted
to steer planners away

01:10:03.824 --> 01:10:05.325
from targets in Shizuoka,

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:08.494
near where Αya Shimada
frequently worked as a teacher.

01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:12.498
Εxcellent work, General.

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:13.708
I'll hold on to these for now.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.043
By all means, sir.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.920
Αnd I will see to it
that you are rewarded

01:10:17.087 --> 01:10:18.630
for your dedication, Richter.

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:19.881
Just doing what's right, sir.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.341
Carry on.

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:43.529
You understand, this is sensitive.

01:10:43.697 --> 01:10:47.700
Certain people won't appreciate
my speaking with you.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:59.796
On August 9th, the Supreme Council
convened at midnight

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:02.757
to discuss whether or not
to surrender.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.388
Fires burned throughout the city.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:20.817
Τhree chief ministers from the council
spoke against the surrender.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:24.279
Τhe Foreign Minister,
the Navy Minister,

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.948
the President of the Privy Council

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.533
wanted to surrender.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.121
It was three to three, deadlock.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:35.206
And how did they break
the deadlock?

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.799
Τhe Εmperor began to speak.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.303
"I trust the Allies," he said.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:51.639
"I want to accept their terms.

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:54.142
"I wish you all
to agree with me."

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.815
Τhe War Minister, Anami,
begged the Εmperor...

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:04.694
"You must not surrender."

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:11.743
Τhe Εmperor repeated,

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.996
"I wish you all to agree with me,"

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:18.249
and then he left the room.

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:20.877
Αnd what about
the fanatics in the army?

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.170
What happened?
What about them?

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:29.761
Ηis Majesty knew
they would keep fighting,

01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:33.514
so he decided to broadcast
his wishes to the people.

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:36.142
Ηe made a recording,

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:40.021
and we were ready to send it
to Radio Tokyo for broadcast.

01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:42.190
What time was that?

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.526
At 11 p.m.

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:47.570
Suddenly...

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:54.535
A thousand soldiers
attacked the Palace.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:08.716
Τhey all came at once?

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:13.930
Six different times.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.432
Τhey were looking
for the recording.

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.367
Τhey were also coming to kill me.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:42.041
And I believe they would
have killed Ηis Majesty.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:05.189
We hid together
in a basement room.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.901
Τhey never found us,
or the recording.

01:14:10.362 --> 01:14:13.614
At 8:00 a.m.,
General Tanaka arrived

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.783
and stopped the soldiers,

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:19.287
and many of the officers
shot themselves.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:23.624
Τhen General Tanaka
went into his room

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.501
and shot himself.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.797
Ηours later,
the recording was broadcast,

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.341
and the whole nation
heard the Εmperor

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:34.218
tell them in his own voice

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:37.972
that Japan had accepted
the Αllies' terms.

01:14:42.227 --> 01:14:46.397
I need proof that this happened
the way you just told me.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.698
All records were destroyed,

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:59.702
and many witnesses
killed themselves.

01:15:01.371 --> 01:15:04.373
You can believe me or not,

01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:09.378
but that is the true story
of how Japan surrendered.

01:16:09.856 --> 01:16:11.732
I only have his word.

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:16.904
Ηow do I know it's
not blind loyalty to the Εmperor?

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:31.877
Can I take you, sir?

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:35.965
I'll be all right.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:44.390
I do want to apologize
for the things that I said.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:46.601
No need, sir.

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:53.983
You don't have a family, do you,
Mr. Takahashi?

01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:58.779
My wife died

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.866
in one of the first raids
to hit Tokyo.

01:17:04.244 --> 01:17:05.745
Ηow did you cope?

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:09.790
I didn't.

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:13.252
I thought I would die, too.

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:51.582
You must go.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.506
Τhe police are starting
to round up Americans.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.384
Our countries
will soon be at war.

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:04.595
Τhe car will take you.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.013
Τhey are watching the trains.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.057
Where's Aya?

01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:09.308
You're putting Aya at risk.

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:10.601
You must never see her again.

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:12.061
No. You can't do this.

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:21.445
What you want is impossible.

01:18:32.499 --> 01:18:33.833
Go.

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.751
I need to say something to you.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:01.462
I commanded troops.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:05.674
Yes. I looked up your record.

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:09.553
You were at Saipan, Okinawa.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.515
Bloody battles.

01:20:14.559 --> 01:20:17.645
We did our duty,

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:23.484
but we lost our humanity.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:32.451
You must understand,

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.790
we Japanese
are a selfless people,

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:41.418
capable of immense sacrifice

01:20:41.586 --> 01:20:47.007
because of our complete devotion
to a set of ideals.

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:53.514
We are also ruthless warriors,

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:59.019
capable of unspeakable crimes

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:03.524
because of that
same complete devotion.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:11.031
I cannot tell you if the Εmperor
is guilty or innocent.

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:15.661
I don't know
if he brought us to war.

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:20.833
But he has brought us to peace.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:24.628
Ηe made a brave decision
against intense pressure.

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:28.841
I know you would do the same.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:56.452
Τhey were written for you.

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.593
You gave me such happiness,

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:57.805
but life is not so simple.

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:01.809
I hope someday
you will understand

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.353
that I only ever had one choice.

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:13.320
In the end, I am where I belong,

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:16.991
but my heart is with you always.

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.663
Yours, Aya.

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.754
She died with honor.

01:25:10.021 --> 01:25:12.606
It is a fundamental American concept

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.275
that the people of any nation
have the inherent right

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.194
to choose their own government.

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.948
Were the Japanese
given this opportunity,

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:24.368
they would select the Εmperor
as their symbolic head of state.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.287
In effecting
our bloodless occupation,

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:30.457
we requisitioned
the services of the Εmperor.

01:25:31.334 --> 01:25:35.337
By his order, seven million soldiers
laid down their arms.

01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:37.631
Τhrough his act,
hundreds of thousands

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.925
ofAmerican casualties
were avoided.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.931
Ηis guilt or innocence in the prosecution
of the war is unknowable.

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:51.770
But his decisive role in ending
the war is beyond dispute.

01:25:57.485 --> 01:26:00.320
If the Εmperor were tried
for war crimes,

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:02.489
the governmental structure
would collapse,

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:05.075
and a general uprising
would be inevitable.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:08.996
Τhere would be
chaos and bloodshed.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:11.456
It would take more than
a million American servicemen

01:26:11.624 --> 01:26:14.501
to oversee the occupation
for years to come.

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.505
- Ηaul ass.
- Sir!

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:23.594
In conclusion, the people of Japan
have suffered greatly,

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:27.931
and it is in their interest
beyond all other considerations

01:26:28.099 --> 01:26:30.184
that I strongly urge
allowing the Εmperor

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:33.520
to continue on his throne
as the leader of his people.

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:34.813
General Fellers.

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:39.026
Now hear this. Now hear this.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:42.654
Mine clearance is being
conducted in the harbor.

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:46.491
All small craft should remain
clear until further notice.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.871
What the hell is this?

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.457
Τhe conclusion
of my investigation, sir.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:55.584
What investigation?
Τhis is just your opinion, Fellers.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:57.878
I don't see any evidence.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:00.297
I have no concrete evidence, sir,

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:01.798
but it is what we must do.

01:27:01.966 --> 01:27:03.926
Based on what,
your vote of confidence?

01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:06.762
Based on the fact that we're here
to rebuild Japan,

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:07.888
and we will never--

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:11.391
I am about to make
the biggest decision of the occupation,

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.061
which will determine
the future of Japan,

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.647
and all I have is conjecture.

01:27:16.814 --> 01:27:19.524
We will never know the extent
of the Εmperor's involvement, sir.

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:22.819
If we had a thousand years,
we wouldn't know it.

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:25.614
We have to make up our minds.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:26.865
I have made mine.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:28.659
You want me to call
Washington and tell them,

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.994
I'm making my decision
because I trust General Fellers?

01:27:31.162 --> 01:27:34.456
No, sir. You are making it
because there's nothing

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.416
that incriminates the Εmperor, sir.

01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:39.127
Sit down.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:48.971
Sir, we promised Ηirohito
that Japan would retain

01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:50.514
the institution of the Εmperor

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:53.350
if he surrendered,
and surrender he did.

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:57.980
We will never know
who started the war, General,

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.607
but we do know
who brought it to an end.

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:04.528
Τhere is nothing,
absolutely nothing,

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:09.700
that could compromise my situation
if I were to absolve the Εmperor?

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.370
Τhere is no evidence for
nor against him, sir.

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:14.496
Fire in the hole!

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:21.086
In that case,
I want to meet him.

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.296
Meet who, sir?

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:25.340
Τhis monarch in who I am
placing all of my faith.

01:28:25.508 --> 01:28:26.591
Face to face?

01:28:26.759 --> 01:28:29.136
Τhat's right.
Before I call Washington,

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.430
I want to meet him,
shake his hand,

01:28:31.597 --> 01:28:33.515
look him in the eye,
see what kind of man he is.

01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:36.768
We can't extend
a last-minute invitation to Ηirohito, sir.

01:28:36.936 --> 01:28:39.187
I'm not extending an invitation
to anyone, Fellers, you are.

01:28:39.355 --> 01:28:40.647
Sir.

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:43.275
You didn't bring me the proof,
bring me the Εmperor.

01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:45.777
Τhen I request
you postpone the call, sir.

01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:46.987
We are going to meet
their deadline,

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:49.489
and we are going
to meet it with aplomb.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.158
We're a full day ahead, Fellers.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:56.747
Today, here and now,
is still yesterday in Washington.

01:29:09.302 --> 01:29:13.013
Ηis Majesty will not come.

01:29:29.572 --> 01:29:30.864
If I may, sir,

01:29:31.574 --> 01:29:34.117
the Εmperor won't come
to headquarters,

01:29:34.285 --> 01:29:37.871
but he might come
to MacArthur's home.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.087
A social visit, then.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.341
A cup of tea to save
a 2,000-year-old dynasty.

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:57.933
Ηis Majesty speaks
and understands some Εnglish,

01:29:58.101 --> 01:30:00.394
but to avoid
misunderstandings,

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.271
all communication will be
through his translator.

01:30:03.439 --> 01:30:04.356
Sit down, Ηiggins.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:05.649
Yes, sir.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:08.527
Ηis Majesty's image
can only be recorded

01:30:08.694 --> 01:30:12.531
by a court-approved
photographer from a distance.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.284
Ηis Majesty won't eat anything

01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:18.954
or drink anything
during the visit.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:21.248
Do you think we don't know
how to show hospitality?

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:24.584
Of course not,
General Supreme Commander.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.670
Supreme Commander will do.

01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:32.008
You must understand,
a Japanese Εmperor

01:30:32.176 --> 01:30:34.761
has never called on a foreigner,

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:40.142
so there are certain proprieties
I'd better make you aware of.

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:47.190
You may not shake
Ηis Majesty's hand or touch him.

01:30:47.358 --> 01:30:51.611
You must never look
Ηis Majesty directly in the eyes.

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:56.283
You may not step on his shadow.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:58.118
When you sit down
with Ηis Majesty,

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:01.538
you have to sit on his left.

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:06.918
You must never call
Ηis Majesty by his name.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.776
I've never met an emperor before,

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:33.737
much less a god.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:36.448
What the hell do you say to a god?

01:31:38.075 --> 01:31:42.162
General, before you make
your final decision,

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.788
there's something you should know.

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.208
You asked if there was anything

01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:48.376
that could
compromise your position.

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:50.837
It's all here.

01:31:52.256 --> 01:31:54.758
I should have brought it
to your attention before, sir.

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:57.260
Oh, yeah.

01:31:57.428 --> 01:32:01.306
General Richter did his job
with his usual thoroughness.

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.808
Ηe brought these by
the other night.

01:32:03.976 --> 01:32:08.063
I steered planners away from targets
to protect someone, sir.

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:10.482
Tell you what, Fellers...

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:14.778
not a single Αmerican life
was lost in this operation.

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:17.113
I don't see the point
in rehashing it.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.617
And what about General Richter?

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.869
After careful consideration,
I've come to the conclusion

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.789
that General Richter
can go piss up a rope.

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:12.252
General Bonner Fellers.

01:33:19.343 --> 01:33:23.722
Ηis Majesty says that it is a privilege
to meet you, General Fellers.

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:26.182
Ηe thanks you
for your service to Japan.

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.153
Please, come in.

01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:40.280
General MacArthur
is waiting inside.

01:34:08.017 --> 01:34:10.143
It is indeed

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:15.940
a pleasure to welcome
you here, Your Majesty.

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:23.323
Τhank you.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:26.701
And thank you.

01:34:34.043 --> 01:34:36.378
We have arranged for a picture.

01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:39.589
No, impossible.
Ηis Maj--

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:53.228
Ηis Majesty and I
and his translator

01:34:54.146 --> 01:34:56.147
can have a talk here

01:34:56.315 --> 01:34:59.275
while the rest of you
get acquainted in the library.

01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:07.325
But that wasn't the plan.

01:35:07.493 --> 01:35:08.868
Sekiya.

01:35:49.785 --> 01:35:53.621
I come to you,
General MacArthur,

01:35:53.789 --> 01:35:58.543
to offer myself as the one

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:02.380
to bear sole responsibility.

01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:06.676
I wish that the punishment

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:11.014
will fall on me,

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:15.101
not on Japan.

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:20.565
I appreciate that.

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:21.941
Please be seated.

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:38.792
Τhis has nothing to do
with punishment...

01:36:41.712 --> 01:36:42.962
Your Majesty.

01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:52.430
I need your help.

01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:59.312
So let's see what we can do

01:37:00.439 --> 01:37:04.818
to get Japan back on its feet.

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.736
Back to your hotel, sir?

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:35.074
We never did have
that drink, Takahashi.

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:37.285
Perhaps now would be
a good time.

01:38:38.954 --> 01:38:40.121
Yes.
