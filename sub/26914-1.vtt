-Yes?

10:34.884 --> 10:35.885
[driver groans]

10:36.927 --> 10:39.096
Time to make a withdrawal, Prescott.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.265
Don't be trouble, now.

10:44.101 --> 10:44.935
Good man.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.576
You got your money.
Now let Lucky and me go.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.330
This money ain't enough
to make up for what your brat did to me.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.916
But, like I promised,

11:06.999 --> 11:08.209
I'll get you home,

11:08.292 --> 11:11.045
just as fast as this train can go.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.174
You won't be needing this any more.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.552
Butch, no! The train will go
out of control! It will crash!

11:18.636 --> 11:21.263
Bon voyage, Jim Prescott.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.184
Stop!

11:39.115 --> 11:40.408
That little...

11:40.699 --> 11:42.243
I'll get rid of her myself.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.333
Butch, where's my dad?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.168
On his way to heaven!

11:51.919 --> 11:53.254

12:12.398 --> 12:13.566
Here, let me.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.819
[groans] This is all my fault!

12:16.902 --> 12:18.737
I should have never messed with Butch.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.740
-[sighs] What if she hurts my dad?
-Would you quit that?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.493
You are the most troublesome girl
I ever met,

12:24.577 --> 12:27.746
but all this is Butch's fault, not yours.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.498
Got it?

And you. And you.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.682
[stammers] You, too.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.268
How many of them are you?

12:49.351 --> 12:51.687
Um... Are you OK?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.356
You got hit in the head
pretty hard, twice.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.900
I'm fine!

12:56.484 --> 12:59.904
It's just all of these dang bees
buzzing around.

[chuckles] Good thing you came along.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.519
You were just about to free us.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.687
Wow!

14:56.770 --> 14:59.189
I must have fought him off good, huh?
[chuckles]

14:59.273 --> 15:00.566

16:05.214 --> 16:07.633
I should have done you in
when I had the chance.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.469
I'm gonna make sure
you never lay a finger on anyone again.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.430
I've been waiting for this day
a long time.

16:14.056 --> 16:18.268
Lucky, you must introduce me
to your handsome friend here.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.229
Name's Grayson.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.855
Ring a bell?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.149
Like "Judge Merle Grayson"?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.988
My daddy, the man you killed

16:29.071 --> 16:31.073
breaking out of prison in Los Búhos!

16:31.573 --> 16:35.452
I can't be expected to remember
everyone who gets in my way.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.998
You are a monster!

16:39.081 --> 16:41.000
[laughs]

16:41.083 --> 16:42.626
You got me.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.713
Go find your dad and stop this train.

-Flowers!

17:16.660 --> 17:17.661
Ha-ha!

17:21.290 --> 17:23.792
Cora, maybe we should send someone else

17:23.876 --> 17:25.335
to go check on Jim...

17:25.419 --> 17:27.254
and Lucky... and the girls.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.172
[Pru] Help!

-Lucky! What are you doing here?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.518
Grayson and I came after the bandits.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.145
I couldn't let Butch hurt you.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.773
I had to come, Dad. I had to find you!

18:05.292 --> 18:07.878
Without that lever, we've got no brakes!

18:07.961 --> 18:09.171
What can I do?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.423
You've done enough. I'll handle this now.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.716
Just get off the train.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.071
He had that same look
on his ratty little face

18:34.154 --> 18:36.573
right before he met his maker.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.451
Duck!

18:41.161 --> 18:43.038
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

Looks like that "brat" saved your life,

just so you can spend it behind bars.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.439
We really did it -

20:32.522 --> 20:34.024
we stopped Butch LePray.

You're a real hero, Mr. Grayson.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.739
Thank you for helping me save my dad.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.823
I wish...

20:46.078 --> 20:48.997
I got two horses stolen
saving your hide, Prescott.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.499
I expect compensation.

-Oh, Jim! Lucky!
-Thank goodness!

Oh, my dear love.

21:00.634 --> 21:01.927
[Jim] Oh, Kate.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.597
You even kept yourselves reasonably clean.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.642
Oh! We're all back together.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.102
It's a miracle!

You know,

21:17.943 --> 21:19.611
just because you missed the wedding,

21:19.695 --> 21:21.405
doesn't mean you can't get married.
