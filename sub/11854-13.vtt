00:08.875 --> 00:10.333
(female #1)
'Here's to big Bertha
and her big old..'

00:10.417 --> 00:14.083
(female #2)
'Oh, she was something else!'

00:14.166 --> 00:15.625
You best keep
it down before

00:15.709 --> 00:17.333
Miss Marion hears y'all.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.667
She gonna kick us all out.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.250
Sadie, honey,
Miss Marion's not hearing
nobody

00:21.333 --> 00:23.417
when she done drunk
a whole jug of hooch herself.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.792
(female #3)
'Don't you talk
mean about my mama.'

00:26.875 --> 00:28.959
Who do you think
you sassing, girl?

00:30.208 --> 00:31.375
Can I have a nip?

00:31.458 --> 00:34.959
Your mama gonna
have a fit she catch you
up.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.875
I'll tuck you in in a shake.

00:36.959 --> 00:40.125
Sadie, you said you was
going to the juke joint.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-uh.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.792
Not tonight.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.625
Well, honey,
my candyman pay me plenty

00:44.709 --> 00:48.291
but I still
got to work tonight.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.417
Candyman give
you candy, Miss Blanche?

00:50.500 --> 00:52.583
You wanna call
it that, honey.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.667
Go on to bed.

00:54.750 --> 00:55.917
Go on.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.709
Arletta make you think on your
own little girl, huh, Sadie?

01:02.208 --> 01:04.959
Where you say your girl stay at?

01:05.041 --> 01:06.083
Virginia.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.834
'She with my cousin.'

01:07.917 --> 01:10.417
I bring her up
when I get the money saved.

01:11.333 --> 01:14.041
Blanche, Manross is waitin'.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.208
Miss Blanche,
Miss Sadie.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.250
Go, Manross, go.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.834
Wait proper-like.

01:19.917 --> 01:21.709
Candyman lookin' mighty fine.

01:21.792 --> 01:24.750
I thought you said
you was working
tonight.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.000
I am, honey.

01:29.041 --> 01:30.959
'Whoo.'

01:35.792 --> 01:38.125
You a big ten-years-old today.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.375
Happy birthday, baby girl.

02:27.417 --> 02:29.375
(Sarah)
'When my mother
passed away a few weeks ago'

02:29.458 --> 02:33.208
'I found this letter among
her belongings hidden away.'

02:33.291 --> 02:37.041
It's the last letter that my
grandmother ever wrote to her.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.625
When was your
grandmother murdered?

02:39.709 --> 02:41.208
1939.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.000
Her name was Sadie Douglas.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.750
Came from Virginia.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.834
Moved north to find
work in the '30s.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.083
I don't know
much more than that.

02:52.166 --> 02:53.542
Your mom didn't talk about her?

02:53.625 --> 02:57.667
She was only ten-years-old
when Sadie was killed

02:57.750 --> 03:01.542
and she never really
forgave her for what she was.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.375
Which was what?

03:03.458 --> 03:07.083
The police called her
a common two-bit hooker.

03:07.166 --> 03:11.250
My mother referred to her
as a white man's whore.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.500
It was hard for her,
knowing that that's

03:13.583 --> 03:15.083
where she came from.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.291
How about you?

03:16.375 --> 03:19.041
Maybe it's affected
me somewhat too.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.625
These letters you
have are from 1939?

03:22.750 --> 03:25.417
Sadie wrote one
to her every week.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.208
Look, I know
I'm asking a lot, but..

03:30.291 --> 03:33.834
...Sadie mentioned
someone here.

03:35.417 --> 03:37.291
"He best not hurt me.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.709
"That milkman best not
hurt your mama."

03:39.792 --> 03:40.750
What milkman?

03:40.834 --> 03:43.417
I don't know.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.083
She never referred to him
in her other letters.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.166
Back then,
the police said

03:48.250 --> 03:49.750
Sadie was a prostitute

03:49.834 --> 03:52.000
killed randomly by a john, but..

03:53.917 --> 03:56.333
...I think my grandmother
knew her killer.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.333
(male #1)
'Homicides..'

04:38.417 --> 04:41.542
...uh, assaults, rapes, and..

04:41.625 --> 04:42.834
...basically every
criminal record

04:42.917 --> 04:45.000
before 1950 is filed here.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.709
County even sticks us with
their medical charts too.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.625
We need homicides.

04:49.709 --> 04:50.834
Right down there.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.208
I thought you said
they were filed.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.667
[chuckles]
They were at once.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.333
I mean, what's the point?

04:55.417 --> 04:57.792
Doers are probably
dust in the wind.

04:57.875 --> 05:01.208
Thanks. Don't wanna waste
anymore of your precious time.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.917
Or cut into
your web-surfing activities.

05:10.583 --> 05:14.208
(Lilly)
"1920, White woman stabbed.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.583
"Suspect, White male with.."

05:16.667 --> 05:17.750
Get this..

05:17.834 --> 05:20.542
"Slender build
and black whiskers."

05:22.041 --> 05:24.542
"1918..

05:24.625 --> 05:26.500
"...1910.."

05:27.792 --> 05:29.834
"'05."

05:31.333 --> 05:33.542
It's a murder ledger, Scotty.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.834
'Goin' all
the way back to..'

05:35.917 --> 05:37.375
..1903.

05:37.458 --> 05:39.500
100 years of murder and mayhem.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.875
All in a you-stash-it
off the highway.

05:41.959 --> 05:44.333
Yo.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.583
I found Sadie.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.875
I had to put 'em in plastic.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.125
They were fallin'
apart in our
hands.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.417
"Sadie Douglas.
Colored female.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.333
"Nativity, Virginia.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.417
"Occupation, prostitute."

06:07.500 --> 06:09.709
Resided at a boarding house
for colored women.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.750
Proprietor was
a Miss Thea Marion.

06:11.834 --> 06:14.208
(Scotty)
'Women in the boarding
house were all hookers.'

06:14.291 --> 06:15.583
"Sadie was raped and suffocated

06:15.667 --> 06:17.583
"at the hands of
an unknown assailant."

06:17.667 --> 06:19.125
Maybe our milkman.

06:19.208 --> 06:21.417
A ticket for New York City
dated the night of the murder

06:21.500 --> 06:23.000
found in
the victim's belongings.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.208
Sadie's daughter
was living in Virginia.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.917
So why is she goin' to New York?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.709
Last to see her was another
tenant at the boarding house

06:31.458 --> 06:33.709
"colored female, 26.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.792
"Blanche D."

06:35.875 --> 06:37.792
The rest of her
name is missing.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.583
You find Blanche
maybe we find out why

06:39.667 --> 06:40.959
Sadie was going to New York.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.792
Like the geezer's
gonna remember.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.291
You and Mr. Sensitivity
track down the milk companies

06:47.375 --> 06:49.208
that delivered
to Sadie's boarding house.

06:49.291 --> 06:52.291
Rush and Valens will
be on geezer patrol.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.917
Looks like she fought back.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.125
Something under her nails?

06:56.208 --> 06:58.000
(John)
'Back then it didn't
matter.'

06:58.083 --> 07:00.667
It does now.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.041
So if the family
gives the green light..

07:04.917 --> 07:06.500
...maybe we dig her up?

07:06.583 --> 07:08.458
(John)
'Yep. Go talk to
her granddaughter.'

07:09.875 --> 07:12.667
An exhumation?
Is that really necessary?

07:12.750 --> 07:15.166
(Lilly)
'She may have fought
her killer, Sarah.'

07:15.250 --> 07:16.959
We might get something useful.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.667
Match the DNA to the doer
or his descendants

07:19.750 --> 07:22.000
if either's in the system.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.917
Alright.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.458
I'll sign whatever
papers you need.

07:26.542 --> 07:27.917
Last to see
your grandmother alive

07:28.000 --> 07:29.834
was a woman named Blanche.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.041
You recall that name
in any of her letters?

07:32.125 --> 07:33.625
Blanche..

07:33.709 --> 07:37.542
...Sadie wrote about a fair
she went to with a Blanche.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.917
That's them.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.542
"I had my first
cotton candy today.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.917
"Like eating sugar
from a cloud."

07:54.000 --> 07:55.709
<i>(Sadie)</i>
<i>"First thing you come</i>
<i>up, I'm gonna get you</i>

07:55.792 --> 07:57.875
<i>"your own cotton candy, baby."</i>

07:57.959 --> 08:00.667
We're gonna
be so happy together.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.041
Your mama misses you

08:04.125 --> 08:07.917
like, like dry land for rain.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.375
"Love, mama."

08:10.625 --> 08:13.291
She sent that photo
with this letter.

08:15.834 --> 08:19.125
Could I take this
and the letters?

08:19.208 --> 08:21.041
Will you bring them back?

08:22.834 --> 08:25.000
They're all I have left of her.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.709
Thing's making me seasick.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.375
At least I got my roll on.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.125
You can't even do yours.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.834
(Will)
'Stop.'

08:47.458 --> 08:49.917
Damn thing's gonna explode.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.458
Good Lord.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.792
Looks like
a Baylor's Milk Company

08:55.875 --> 08:58.667
delivered to North
15th Street through the 1930s.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.458
Where Sadie's
boarding house was.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.417
Yeah. Board of revenue's
got Baylor's employee records

09:03.500 --> 09:05.500
'1930 to 1938.'

09:06.542 --> 09:08.375
But nothing for 1939.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.000
So why is that year missing?

09:12.083 --> 09:14.542
"Fire. January 1939."

09:15.709 --> 09:19.166
Company stopped keeping
records after that.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.667
Fire must've really
wiped them out.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.208
They went out of business
a year later.

09:22.291 --> 09:24.291
If this fire cost lives,
newspapers would have

09:24.375 --> 09:26.208
carried accounts, right?

09:26.291 --> 09:27.291
Yeah.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.625
So maybe our milkman's

09:28.709 --> 09:30.166
in one of those newspapers?

09:36.166 --> 09:37.208
Are we sure this place

09:37.291 --> 09:39.458
got prostitution arrests
before 1950?

09:39.542 --> 09:42.000
(Rush)
'Hookers, homicides,
the works.'

09:42.083 --> 09:45.250
If Blanche got picked up,
we'll find her here.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.750
Wonder where she is now.

09:46.834 --> 09:49.375
Wherever hookers who
make it to 91 end up.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.750
Let's hope it
ain't
hooker heaven.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.166
"Debbins, Blanche."

09:54.250 --> 09:55.750
This our girl?

09:57.417 --> 09:59.500
Oh..

09:59.583 --> 10:01.583
She's a
dead-ringer
for this Blanche.

10:04.417 --> 10:07.792
"Arrested for
prostitution in 1940."

10:07.875 --> 10:10.875
"Delaney Manross
paid for her bail.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.125
Manross Delaney?

10:12.208 --> 10:14.709
The candyman?

10:14.792 --> 10:16.667
Delaney's Delights?

10:16.750 --> 10:18.375
You never had
a Delaney
Delight?

10:18.458 --> 10:19.709
No.

10:19.792 --> 10:22.875
Guy's got a candy
franchise,
been rakin' it in forever.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.625
Maybe our hooker's
moved up in the world, huh?

10:36.875 --> 10:38.458
Blanche Debbins?

10:38.542 --> 10:40.792
I ain't used
that name in decades.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.041
What do you want, honey?

10:42.125 --> 10:44.709
Philadelphia Homicide,
Miss Blanche.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.834
And the police too.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.625
Make me feel young again.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.792
Honey, Manross.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.458
(Manross)
'I'm watching
my talk show, honey!'

10:52.542 --> 10:53.542
Well turn it off, honey.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.166
We got guests.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.750
'That was
the Depression, honey.'

10:57.834 --> 10:59.417
Times were hard all over

10:59.500 --> 11:03.417
especially for colored women
comin' up alone from the
south.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.875
You did what you could
to make ends meet.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.750
Today's young people
don't understand.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.291
Y'all help yourself.

11:11.542 --> 11:12.917
Try my number nine.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.375
He gets on his high
horse sometimes.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.583
Don't mind him.
That's what I do.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.458
Isn't that right, candyman?

11:19.542 --> 11:23.750
Day she called me candyman,
I fell head over heels.

11:23.834 --> 11:26.917
Been fallin' for her ever since.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.083
You know anything about
a trip Sadie was takin'

11:29.166 --> 11:31.208
to New York, Miss Blanche,
the night she was killed?

11:31.291 --> 11:33.875
She told us she
was going to
bed..

11:33.959 --> 11:35.083
...not to New York.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.166
Well, did Sadie
ever mention anyone

11:37.250 --> 11:39.917
maybe a milkman
she was afraid of?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.041
That rebby boy.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.542
What's his name?

11:42.625 --> 11:45.041
Southern rebel wannabe.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.041
Wasn't more than
northern White
trash.

11:47.125 --> 11:48.417
What was his name?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.709
I don't recall, honey.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.000
Pierce. That was his name.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.542
He had burns
all over his face.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.125
I'm tellin' the story, honey.

11:56.208 --> 12:00.583
He had burns all over his
face,
had it out for Sadie too.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.208
All because
of that damn milk.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.667
I ain't gettin' out.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.625
Not for no
colored whorehouse.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.792
Let 'em get
their
own damn milk.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.208
(Jonesy)
'Oh, here comes another one.'

12:31.291 --> 12:33.583
'Looks almost White, don't she?'

12:36.333 --> 12:38.291
(Pierce)
'Come and get it!'

12:39.750 --> 12:42.000
Who that cooze
think she is, huh?

12:43.458 --> 12:45.166
- Hey, dump it.
- Huh?

12:45.250 --> 12:47.000
I said dump it, Jonesy.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.083
Let her clean it up.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.709
Don't.

13:14.792 --> 13:18.166
Sadie turned and walked
right back into the house

13:18.250 --> 13:20.667
and left that milk
out in the street.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.917
That other milkman
wasn't no better.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.375
Didn't I say
I'm telling the story?

13:24.458 --> 13:27.208
This, uh, Pierce
cause any other trouble?

13:27.291 --> 13:29.333
Not that Sadie mentioned.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.375
I avoided him
and his milk truck after
that.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.917
But Sadie was afraid
he might hurt her.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.875
Wrote about him in
a letter to her daughter.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.208
Honey, Sadie
couldn't read or write.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.917
'None of us could back then.'

13:42.000 --> 13:44.625
But she sent letters
to her daughter.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.333
- Lots of them.
- 'Well..'

13:46.417 --> 13:48.250
She might have sent them..

13:48.333 --> 13:50.625
...but she sure
didn't write them.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.583
So who wrote
Sadie's letters?

13:58.667 --> 14:01.125
No one in the house
could read or write.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.583
A john maybe?

14:02.667 --> 14:03.667
Whoever it was, might've known

14:03.750 --> 14:04.959
more about the milkman.

14:05.041 --> 14:06.333
Well, if the milkman
was this guy Pierce

14:06.417 --> 14:08.208
then we might have the answer.

14:08.291 --> 14:10.000
Newspaper from 1939.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.834
Pierce McClintock
listed as a burn victim

14:11.917 --> 14:13.667
in the Baylor's Milk Company
fire.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.333
(Lilly)
'The same company delivered
milk to Sadie's boarding
house.'

14:16.417 --> 14:18.583
Yep. Fire was set
by pissed off White workers

14:18.667 --> 14:19.917
'when the company hired Blacks.'

14:20.000 --> 14:22.208
Killed ten, injured
five more, including Pierce.

14:22.291 --> 14:26.041
But lucky for us,
newspapers back then

14:26.125 --> 14:27.458
printed the victims' addresses.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.291
(Nick)
"6922 North, 5th Street."

14:32.375 --> 14:34.917
We just gotta pray
that Pierce is still there.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.709
'Well, yeah.'

14:36.792 --> 14:37.959
And I'll throw in a hail Mary

14:38.041 --> 14:39.500
if we find
who wrote this
letter.

14:41.083 --> 14:44.500
- So this is from 1939, huh?
- 'Interesting?'

14:44.583 --> 14:46.041
'Well, you can tell from
someone's' handwriting'

14:46.125 --> 14:47.083
'who they are?'

14:47.166 --> 14:48.875
No. Gender, age

14:48.959 --> 14:51.458
personality type,
region of origin.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.834
Pretty much, yeah.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.083
How?

14:54.166 --> 14:55.458
See these looped letters?

14:55.542 --> 14:58.041
Curved forms combined
with medium pressure

14:58.125 --> 15:00.750
are usually indicators
of femininity.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.291
Writer was female?

15:02.375 --> 15:03.709
Eh, best guess.

15:03.792 --> 15:07.500
Kinda KO's our
theory
of a john as the
writer.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.792
So who the hell
wrote this
letter?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.417
Give me a few hours,
I'll have an answer for you.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.792
What's that tell you?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.291
Ah. Firm.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.208
'Logical..'

15:23.458 --> 15:25.083
Running from something?

15:26.834 --> 15:28.458
(Will)
'So your grandfather
Pierce McClintock'

15:28.542 --> 15:29.500
owned this house?

15:29.583 --> 15:31.333
He passed away ten years ago.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.458
I inherited the house from him.

15:33.542 --> 15:38.417
I can't understand what he has
to do with this woman's murder.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.291
Well, we don't
know either, Ms. Reilly.

15:40.375 --> 15:41.542
That's why we're here.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.500
He was a good man,
my grandfather.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.000
Not a murderer.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.417
So you'd agree to volunteer
your DNA to prove that?

15:47.500 --> 15:49.125
I don't need to prove
that to anyone.

15:49.208 --> 15:50.500
We can get a search warrant.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.834
For what,
an old man's knickknacks?

15:52.917 --> 15:55.166
A dead man's diary?

15:55.250 --> 15:57.041
Pierce kept a diary?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.667
After the fire at Baylor's
Milk,
Pierce refers to something

16:01.750 --> 16:03.750
called The Fifth Day
in his diary.

16:03.834 --> 16:04.875
(Rush)
'The Fifth Day?'

16:04.959 --> 16:06.834
Mentioned it
a bunch of times.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.375
Don't you dare put
that in your mouth.

16:09.458 --> 16:13.208
(Scotty)
'I like Cheez Whiz on
my cheesesteak. So what?'

16:13.291 --> 16:14.583
(Nick)
'Fifth Day sounds like'

16:14.667 --> 16:16.834
some sort of group
Pierce started.

16:16.917 --> 16:18.959
Guys from the milk place
injured in the fire.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.375
What'd they do?

16:20.458 --> 16:23.000
Doesn't say
but check that entry out.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.041
"May 1939.

16:28.125 --> 16:31.166
"Pierce's milk
bottle war with Sadie."

16:31.250 --> 16:32.375
'He writes about it.'

16:32.458 --> 16:34.125
That thing Blanche
told us about?

16:34.208 --> 16:35.542
The aftermath.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.625
"Delivered to that colored's
boarding house today

16:37.709 --> 16:40.792
"and that flooze just left
them
bottles out on the street."

16:45.625 --> 16:46.834
(Pierce)
'Dammit.'

16:46.917 --> 16:49.208
She didn't even pick 'em up.

16:49.291 --> 16:50.917
Look at that coon, will ya?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.709
'Standing there like
she runs the joint.'

16:54.792 --> 16:56.417
Fifth Day oughta
teach her a lesson.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.959
Fifth Day is right. Take that
gleam outta that quiff's eye.

17:00.041 --> 17:03.041
'Go on, Jonesy.
You show her.'

17:11.333 --> 17:12.709
Here's your milk.

17:17.500 --> 17:21.667
So maybe Jonesy was
our evil milkman and not
Pierce.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.041
No Jonesy listed as
a victim in the fire.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.458
But all them Fifth Day guys
got
messed up in the fire, right?

17:26.542 --> 17:28.166
So how'd Jonesy
get involved with 'em?

17:28.250 --> 17:30.625
And what's he mean by The Fifth
Day oughta teach her a lesson?

17:30.709 --> 17:32.625
Maybe that's what
their little club did.

17:32.709 --> 17:35.000
'Teach lessons
to women like Sadie.'

17:35.083 --> 17:37.250
Let's check criminal records
for Pierce McClintock.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.125
Maybe his Fifth Day
activities made the books.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.208
Any word on the city
okaying the exhumation?

17:42.291 --> 17:43.208
Hmm..

17:43.291 --> 17:44.625
Kite's been in court all day.

17:44.709 --> 17:47.291
So ask him tonight.

17:48.583 --> 17:49.834
Or tomorrow.

17:55.583 --> 17:59.458
I've called you three
times about this exhumation.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.208
Closing arguments on
the Wicker job.

18:01.291 --> 18:05.542
Besides, you've ignored
a few of my calls lately
too.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.750
Been busy.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.333
Well, there you go.
We're both busy.

18:09.417 --> 18:11.709
Anyway, we got direction
on this job--

18:11.792 --> 18:13.041
From '39.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.041
So?

18:14.125 --> 18:15.625
So it's hard to make a case

18:15.709 --> 18:18.500
that the exhumation is
pressing,
you know what I mean?

18:18.583 --> 18:21.041
Maybe the judge should meet
the victim's granddaughter.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.041
It's pressing to her.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.709
Look, Fisk hasn't gotten to it

18:23.792 --> 18:26.500
but I'm guessing you'll
need more probable cause.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.875
City's strapped for cash.

18:27.959 --> 18:30.458
And this granddaughter
wants answers.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.125
Don't we all?

18:33.834 --> 18:36.834
- How're the cats, anyway?
- 'Good.'

18:47.417 --> 18:49.041
Call me.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.000
When you hear from Fisk, I mean.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.417
Sure.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.041
(Scotty)
'Get anything
in criminal records?'

18:54.125 --> 18:56.041
Long rap sheet on Pierce.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.000
Assaults on males
and females, all Black.

18:59.083 --> 19:00.959
Victims claimed they were
attacked by a group

19:01.041 --> 19:02.750
of young White males.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.166
African American History Museum

19:04.250 --> 19:06.917
had a listing
of hate groups in '39.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.875
They list The Fifth Day
as one in Philly.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.375
White supremacists.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.959
Took their name
from the Fifth Day of
Creation.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.000
"God said, Let us make man
in our image

19:15.083 --> 19:16.792
"and let him rule
over all the Earth."

19:16.875 --> 19:18.875
Meaning the White man of course.

19:18.959 --> 19:20.166
Mission was
to terrorize Blacks

19:20.250 --> 19:22.041
comin' up from the south
looking for jobs.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.208
Every fifth day
they'd go on a rampage.

19:24.291 --> 19:27.500
Beat up some Black person
for the crime of being
alive.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.625
Murder part of their game?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.417
Could be. Check it out.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.000
The Fifth Day.

19:33.083 --> 19:35.166
Meet Pierce, and
our friend
Jonesy.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.625
Jonesy don't look burned.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.625
Could have 'em where
the sun don't shine.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.750
Museum didn't have
last names on these clowns.

19:44.834 --> 19:48.333
ID'd 'em here only by their
monikers or first name.

19:48.417 --> 19:49.667
(Nick)
'We'll keep looking.'

19:49.750 --> 19:52.250
Lilly's still with the ADA?

19:52.333 --> 19:53.583
Our handwriting
expert came back

19:53.667 --> 19:55.542
'With a profile
of the letter writer.'

19:55.625 --> 19:57.375
It was a kid.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.542
The only child
in the boarding house

20:00.625 --> 20:01.917
was the owner's daughter.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.375
Ten-years-old
at the time of the murder.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.291
I'll go pick up Lill.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.458
This was
Miss Sadie's favorite room.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.917
My mother took in boarders
during the Depression.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.583
I hear this place
is a bed and breakfast now?

20:33.667 --> 20:36.709
Owners say it was okay
for us to come in.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.458
'Bring you back
to your old home.'

20:38.542 --> 20:40.709
I'm glad no one tore it down.

20:40.792 --> 20:42.792
Did you write
Sadie's letters here?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.792
I wrote them, yes.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.375
But the words were hers.

20:46.458 --> 20:49.333
'Her baby girl meant
the whole world to her.'

20:49.417 --> 20:53.125
Do you remember writing about
a milkman who might hurt Sadie?

20:53.208 --> 20:54.375
Jonesy.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.166
I remember him well.

20:57.250 --> 20:58.250
Why?

20:58.333 --> 21:00.542
Because of what
Sadie found in the milk.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.583
(Pierce)
'Show her who's boss.'

21:11.083 --> 21:12.250
Here's your milk.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.083
Nothin' but poor
White milkman trash.

21:21.166 --> 21:24.000
Who he think he is?
Trashy ol'..

21:34.000 --> 21:36.458
Poor White milkman trash
left a note, Miss Sadie.

21:36.542 --> 21:38.458
Shush, girl.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.583
What's this say?

21:48.667 --> 21:50.959
He says "forgive me."

21:55.959 --> 21:57.417
Crazy White trash.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.000
He sayin' he's sorry.

21:59.083 --> 22:02.208
I still say he trash.

22:02.291 --> 22:06.709
That ain't nothin'
but tinder for the
fire.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.709
Go on,
Arletta.
Throw it in.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.542
Wait.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.375
Write somethin' for me.

23:09.333 --> 23:12.750
"Because you are a lady."

23:56.917 --> 24:00.208
Those notes went
on and on for months

24:00.291 --> 24:02.041
'right till she died.'

24:02.125 --> 24:04.709
Why did she think
Jonesy would hurt her?

24:04.792 --> 24:08.333
I think it was
her heart she meant.

24:08.417 --> 24:11.542
Did they exchange notes
the day she was killed?

24:11.625 --> 24:15.166
Jonesy wanted her
to meet him here that night.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.834
For a proper visit.

24:17.917 --> 24:21.000
Miss Sadie kept
each and every note.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.959
Hid 'em behind the stove
where no one would look.

24:24.041 --> 24:25.291
No one ever found 'em.

24:25.375 --> 24:28.542
- Why not?
- Because I took 'em.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.500
Still have 'em too.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.667
"I was raised
by other people, Sadie.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.792
"Don't even know my own folks."

24:41.875 --> 24:43.333
Jonesy was an orphan?

24:43.417 --> 24:46.375
Maybe check the children's homes
in the area, look for his name.

24:46.458 --> 24:48.083
Mm-hmm.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.709
"I'll care for
your little girl

24:49.792 --> 24:51.500
"even if she ain't my own

24:51.583 --> 24:54.125
"'cause she's like me.

24:54.208 --> 24:57.125
"Every child deserves
to be loved."

24:58.792 --> 25:01.291
He wanted to make
a life with her.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.583
And take her kid in too.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.709
A real 180 from The Fifth Day.

25:04.792 --> 25:06.959
So was Sadie killed
by the man who hated her

25:07.041 --> 25:08.250
or the man who loved her?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.834
Pierce or Jonesy?

25:09.917 --> 25:11.917
Maybe something happened that
night at the boarding house

25:12.000 --> 25:13.625
that turned the tide
of Jonesy's love.

25:13.709 --> 25:16.000
Love can turn on a dime.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.250
(John)
'We know a candyman?'

25:18.792 --> 25:22.333
"Do you love me, Sadie,
or do you love the candyman?"

25:29.500 --> 25:31.083
Blanche's husband.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.583
Blanche and I, we..

25:37.667 --> 25:40.000
...just started dating..

25:40.083 --> 25:42.083
...and I, uh..

25:42.166 --> 25:44.625
...had a little crush on Sadie.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.083
Don't you
do this to me, Manross.

25:47.166 --> 25:49.834
We can talk somewhere else if
that would make it easier.

25:49.917 --> 25:52.250
I was young.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.417
Foolish.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.792
Thought I could have
my cake and eat it too.

25:57.875 --> 26:00.625
Sadie never went for it.

26:00.709 --> 26:03.834
Because she was
involved with Jonesy.

26:03.917 --> 26:05.291
Hmm.

26:05.375 --> 26:06.792
So you knew about the affair.

26:06.875 --> 26:09.500
Not till the night
she was killed.

26:09.583 --> 26:11.709
They hid it well.

26:11.792 --> 26:13.208
You had to back then.

26:13.291 --> 26:16.083
If anyone found out,
one of 'em would be dead.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.208
One of them is dead.

26:18.291 --> 26:21.792
So how'd you find out
the night of Sadie's murder?

26:21.875 --> 26:25.000
We were all supposed
to meet up at the juke
joint.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.625
I thought Sadie was gonna be
there but she-she wasn't.

26:28.709 --> 26:31.333
So I went down to
the boarding house to get her.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.250
(Jonesy)
'We got to go tonight,
Sadie.'

26:43.333 --> 26:44.792
(Sadie)
'I can't just go.'

26:44.875 --> 26:47.709
(Jonesy)
'But we talked about this.'

26:47.792 --> 26:49.041
(Sadie)
'We was just going to
visit.'

26:49.125 --> 26:50.542
'That's what you
said in your note.'

26:50.625 --> 26:53.667
(Jonesy)
'I know, but..'

26:53.750 --> 26:56.000
'...something came up.'

26:56.083 --> 26:57.750
(Sadie)
'What?'

26:57.834 --> 26:59.417
Look..

26:59.500 --> 27:01.458
...you gotta leave
with me right now.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.667
I already got the tickets,
the train leaves in a
half-hour.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.834
We go now and we make it, Sadie.

27:05.917 --> 27:10.125
I want to but why's
it gotta be tonight?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.458
What's wrong, Jonesy?

27:17.125 --> 27:19.417
I went back to the juke joint.

27:21.417 --> 27:24.375
Never seen her again.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.166
Sadie was asking
for trouble taking up

27:26.250 --> 27:27.709
with that half-blind White boy.

27:27.792 --> 27:30.291
Wait, what do you
mean half-blind?

27:30.375 --> 27:33.709
Couldn't see out of one eye
on account of the fire.

27:33.792 --> 27:36.709
Why didn't you ever tell
anyone what you saw that night?

27:36.792 --> 27:38.792
'Cause I didn't wanna hurt..

27:41.458 --> 27:43.625
...the woman I love.

27:44.959 --> 27:47.458
But I did anyway.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.000
Manross volunteered his DNA

27:53.083 --> 27:55.291
fingerprints,
shirt off his back.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.041
You really think
this guy's the doer.

27:57.125 --> 27:58.667
(Scotty)
'You know, sometimes jealousy'

27:58.750 --> 28:00.458
beats out
love and hate, hands down.

28:00.542 --> 28:01.792
(Lilly)
'What I don't get is Jonesy'

28:01.875 --> 28:04.750
was just gonna
visit Sadie that night

28:04.834 --> 28:06.000
but then something happens.

28:06.083 --> 28:08.750
And he's frantic
to get outta town.

28:08.834 --> 28:10.667
Something like what?

28:10.750 --> 28:13.750
Pierce found out
his White supremacist pal

28:13.834 --> 28:16.333
fell in love with a Black woman?

28:16.417 --> 28:18.250
Threatens revenge on 'em both.

28:18.333 --> 28:19.542
Got our milkman.

28:19.625 --> 28:20.709
Nathan Jones.

28:20.792 --> 28:22.583
Just his name,
but it's a start.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.250
Grew up in a boys'
home in Philly.

28:24.333 --> 28:25.917
(Will)
'Ran him through
autotrack, DMV'

28:26.000 --> 28:27.667
'even military records.'

28:27.750 --> 28:29.291
Got a thousand
and one hits back.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.875
Manross said Jonesy
was injured in the fire

28:31.959 --> 28:33.542
went half-blind later.

28:33.625 --> 28:36.417
If he applied for military duty,
he'd have been rejected, right?

28:36.500 --> 28:39.125
Wait a sec.
My-my old man went through
this.

28:39.208 --> 28:40.792
A class 4F rejection.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.667
Unacceptable for military duty.

28:42.750 --> 28:43.959
Made him feel like
he had to wear

28:44.041 --> 28:45.333
a dunce cap
back in the day.

28:45.417 --> 28:49.125
So we check Nathan Jones
with 4F records.

28:49.208 --> 28:50.458
(Will)
'Then maybe we finally'

28:50.542 --> 28:52.375
'nail down this
son of a bitch.'

28:52.458 --> 28:53.417
Hey, Rush.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.000
Hi. H-how'd it go?

28:57.500 --> 29:00.667
Judge Fisk KO'd
the motion to exhume.

29:02.166 --> 29:03.083
What?

29:03.166 --> 29:04.667
Not enough probable cause.

29:06.208 --> 29:08.625
We got.. We've got three
possible doers here, Kite.

29:08.709 --> 29:10.250
Look, it's
an ancient case, okay?

29:10.333 --> 29:12.333
And the bottom line
is cold cash.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.125
'We don't have any to spare.'

29:15.208 --> 29:16.375
Sorry.

29:25.542 --> 29:26.625
(Lilly)
'Sarah?'

29:27.458 --> 29:29.125
Hi. Any news?

29:29.208 --> 29:32.917
I thought, uh,
you might want these.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.834
Notes to Sadie
from the milkman in her
letter.

29:36.917 --> 29:39.375
She wasn't afraid of him, Sarah

29:39.458 --> 29:41.458
she was in love with him.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.041
"I'll care for
your little girl

29:49.125 --> 29:50.792
"even if she ain't my own."

29:50.875 --> 29:54.750
He wanted to take care of her,
and your mother.

29:57.792 --> 30:01.875
I wish she had had a chance to
see this, to-to know this.

30:03.709 --> 30:04.875
Your mom?

30:06.875 --> 30:09.291
I'm sorry.

30:11.041 --> 30:13.917
It's okay.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.959
I have some
bad news too, Sarah.

30:19.041 --> 30:22.166
The DA's office didn't
grant the motion to exhume.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.000
But I'm the family,
don't I have a say?

30:24.083 --> 30:26.291
It's not that.

30:26.375 --> 30:29.041
They need more
of a reason to do it.

30:29.125 --> 30:32.166
Solving my grandmother's murder
isn't a good enough reason?

30:32.250 --> 30:33.625
It's complicated.

30:34.917 --> 30:37.417
Financially difficult.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.000
I'll pay for it.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.166
Sarah..

30:41.250 --> 30:45.458
...an exhumation and an autopsy
costs at least $10,000.

30:47.667 --> 30:50.083
I've memorized
all of her letters.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.458
These past
few days, I feel as if

30:53.542 --> 30:56.750
I've come as close to meeting
my grandmother as I ever will.

30:56.834 --> 30:58.875
'I know how she lived.'

30:58.959 --> 31:01.291
But I still need
to know how she died.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.041
Body is in an early stage
of dried mummification..

31:10.542 --> 31:12.625
...soft tissue..

31:12.709 --> 31:15.709
'...desiccated
down to the bone.'

31:15.792 --> 31:18.583
What are the odds on DNA,
Dr. Barnsley?

31:18.667 --> 31:22.834
This is my first
65-year-old cadaver but..

31:22.917 --> 31:25.125
...DNA can last
hundreds of years.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.792
Well, she fought back,
broke three fingernails.

31:27.875 --> 31:30.166
Maybe the doer
left a souvenir.

31:30.250 --> 31:34.959
The fingers are in advanced
stage of dehydration but..

31:35.041 --> 31:37.875
...I might be able to
collect some scrapings.

31:37.959 --> 31:40.417
Valens.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.834
You're kiddin'.

31:41.917 --> 31:43.500
'Where?'

31:43.583 --> 31:45.792
Alright.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.083
Jeffries and Vera found Jonesy.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.875
He's still alive?

31:49.959 --> 31:53.166
And kickin' it in New York City.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.625
Detectives..

31:54.709 --> 31:58.000
...the index finger
of the right hand..

31:58.083 --> 32:00.208
I think maybe
we've got
something.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.750
Maybe Sadie's
speaking from the grave.

32:09.250 --> 32:12.291
Lab's running Pierce's DNA
from his granddaughter.

32:12.375 --> 32:13.625
Manross' too.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.750
$19.50 to take
a train to New
York.

32:16.834 --> 32:18.542
That's going on the cheap.

32:18.625 --> 32:21.000
Taking SEPTA
and the New Jersey Transit.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.333
We gotta find an
Amtrak
cop on the way back.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.291
Take a free hop on the Acela.

32:27.333 --> 32:30.458
Kite pissed you off, huh,
not fighting for the
exhumation?

32:33.417 --> 32:35.333
It wasn't really
his decision
though.

32:35.417 --> 32:38.333
Or was it something else
with Kite pissed you off?

32:40.333 --> 32:43.166
I gotta be psychic to
get an answer out of
you?

32:45.917 --> 32:48.667
I, uh..

32:48.750 --> 32:50.375
...might have
made a mistake.

32:54.417 --> 32:56.792
Rush.

32:56.875 --> 32:59.250
Okay.

32:59.333 --> 33:00.875
Thanks, boss.

33:00.959 --> 33:02.417
Manross cleared.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.667
His DNA didn't match with
what was under Sadie's nails.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.417
So candyman ain't our doer.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.041
Gotta admit,
I'm glad for
Blanche.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.375
Must be nice knowing
you got someone

33:12.458 --> 33:14.667
to grow old
and useless with.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.875
Yeah, must be.

33:29.834 --> 33:33.041
(Frankie)
'Grandpa? You got visitors.'

33:36.542 --> 33:39.208
We're here about
Sadie Douglas, Mr. Jones.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.166
Sadie.

33:51.041 --> 33:53.709
You remember how she got killed?

33:55.291 --> 33:57.375
Raped, suffocated?

33:57.458 --> 34:00.417
Hey. What are you saying to him?

34:00.500 --> 34:02.709
(Jonesy)
'Never mind.'

34:02.792 --> 34:05.834
Frankie, why don't
you go watch TV?

34:09.709 --> 34:11.166
You didn't finish
your soup, grandpa.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.208
I'm done, Frankie.

34:13.291 --> 34:14.542
Go on.

34:15.542 --> 34:16.792
Yeah.

34:18.041 --> 34:20.417
I remember how she died.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.750
Cops back then
said it was a john.

34:23.834 --> 34:27.583
Oh, no, she wasn't a prostitute.

34:27.667 --> 34:30.083
'She lived in that house
'cause she had to.'

34:31.291 --> 34:34.375
Times were rough back then.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.417
She didn't make her
living hustlin'?

34:38.542 --> 34:40.792
Sadie was a lady.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.917
I gave her some money
from time to time.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.583
Of course
she couldn't tell anybody

34:45.667 --> 34:47.625
where she was getting it from.

34:47.709 --> 34:49.583
Times being what they were.

34:49.667 --> 34:50.750
Yeah.

34:50.834 --> 34:53.834
And you being in love.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.959
(Frankie)
'Who the hell is Sadie?'

34:58.792 --> 35:00.000
You know, her..

35:00.083 --> 35:01.750
...her little girl
ought to know

35:01.834 --> 35:04.500
that her mama was a lady.

35:04.583 --> 35:07.250
(Scotty)
'She's dead.'

35:07.333 --> 35:08.667
Sadie's daughter.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.500
Night of Sadie's murder..

35:10.583 --> 35:14.125
...you wanted her
to leave town with you. Why?

35:17.417 --> 35:19.542
Because they were coming.

35:20.208 --> 35:22.834
(Scotty)
'Who?'

35:22.917 --> 35:24.333
Them.

35:26.709 --> 35:27.834
They were coming.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.500
(Pierce)
'So then, I says to her'

35:30.583 --> 35:34.750
that you may look almost
white,
but you is black as midnight.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.291
Jonesy over there
don't think I'm funny.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.709
(male #2)
'Oh, that's 'cause he's
givin'
her his mornin' milk.'

35:46.792 --> 35:49.875
Time that bitch got a real
taste of White man's milk.

35:49.959 --> 35:50.875
'Yeah..'

35:51.917 --> 35:53.542
Ain't that right, Jonesy?

35:55.333 --> 35:56.792
- Damn right.
- 'Yeah!'

35:56.875 --> 36:00.417
Fifth Day's rollin',
boys tonight!

36:00.500 --> 36:02.458
(all)
Tonight!

36:08.542 --> 36:09.875
Sadie?

36:09.959 --> 36:12.917
Sadie! Sadie!

36:13.000 --> 36:16.458
I tried to save her
but she wouldn't go.

36:16.542 --> 36:19.250
I begged her
but she wouldn't go.

36:20.875 --> 36:22.834
And I left.

36:22.917 --> 36:26.250
A man loves a woman,
and leaves her to that?

36:28.250 --> 36:31.041
All this was forever ago.
Why you care now?

36:31.125 --> 36:33.250
Because a woman died..

36:33.333 --> 36:36.083
...and a family
wants to know why.

36:36.166 --> 36:39.458
And because what happens
in the past

36:39.542 --> 36:42.625
never really
goes away, does it?

36:45.250 --> 36:47.500
No, it don't.

36:47.583 --> 36:48.792
My grandpa didn't do nothin'.

36:51.625 --> 36:54.208
Would you volunteer your DNA..

36:54.291 --> 36:55.458
'...to prove that?'

36:55.542 --> 36:58.500
We got a sister lab
here in New York.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.792
It'll take a few minutes
to run your DNA.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.208
And we can go right now.

37:02.291 --> 37:05.959
'He'll do it.'
Right, Grandpa?

37:07.542 --> 37:10.166
I'll get your coat.
He didn't do nothin'.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.041
(Lilly)
'We'll settle this whole
thing'

37:13.125 --> 37:15.166
in four or five minutes,
Mr. Jones.

37:15.250 --> 37:18.291
Lab's got a process called, uh..

37:18.375 --> 37:20.458
...Electronic DNA Sampling.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.667
EDS for short.

37:21.750 --> 37:24.208
Zaps your DNA
through the Internet.

37:24.291 --> 37:27.709
Compares it with what we found
under Sadie's fingernails.

37:27.792 --> 37:30.417
(Scotty)
'Finds a match.'

37:30.500 --> 37:31.959
Unless you want
to skip the trip

37:32.041 --> 37:33.959
and tell us
what really happened?

37:36.250 --> 37:38.542
If you have
a question, ask it.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.709
Thought I just did.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.792
Come on, grandpa.

37:51.917 --> 37:53.875
I'm ready.

37:55.458 --> 37:57.667
Go ahead and ask your question.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.333
(Scotty)
'What happened..'

37:59.417 --> 38:01.542
...the night Sadie was killed?

38:05.041 --> 38:06.291
You gotta leave with me now.

38:06.375 --> 38:07.667
Look, I already got
the tickets

38:07.750 --> 38:09.083
the train leaves
in half an hour.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.500
We go now,
we can make it, Sadie.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.083
I want to, but
why
it gotta be
tonight?

38:19.041 --> 38:21.583
What's wrong, Jonesy?

38:25.917 --> 38:27.125
We gotta go.

38:27.208 --> 38:30.375
- The train to New York is--
- New York?

38:30.458 --> 38:33.208
But my daughter
lives in Virginia.

38:33.291 --> 38:34.667
We'll send for her.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.500
You promised we was gonna
be a family together.

38:36.583 --> 38:38.667
We will, but we gotta go now.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.667
What about her?
What about her, Jonesy?

38:47.875 --> 38:49.917
That's, uh..

38:50.000 --> 38:51.542
That's your daughter?

38:51.625 --> 38:55.625
You promised to care for her
like she was your own, remember?

38:55.709 --> 38:58.166
''Cause every child
deserves lovin'.'

38:58.250 --> 39:00.875
You said..

39:02.667 --> 39:05.291
You, uh..

39:05.375 --> 39:07.667
...never showed
me that before.

39:08.917 --> 39:11.458
Why won't you
look at her, Jonesy?

39:14.667 --> 39:18.333
You and me, we can
make it together

39:18.417 --> 39:19.750
because no one
will know, Sadie.

39:19.834 --> 39:21.166
No one'll know what you are.

39:21.250 --> 39:23.041
You barely look it,
Sadie, and you can
pass.

39:23.125 --> 39:24.208
Shut up!

39:24.291 --> 39:25.959
She can't pass but you can.

39:26.041 --> 39:27.291
And-and we can have
a life together

39:27.375 --> 39:28.417
and no one'll ever know.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.041
Shut up!

39:30.959 --> 39:32.792
Because I love you, Sadie.

39:34.375 --> 39:36.542
I love you.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.542
No, you don't.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.709
Just told me so.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.083
Well, looky at what we got here.

39:49.166 --> 39:51.291
Jonesy's gettin'
a leg up on us, boys.

39:51.375 --> 39:53.834
Ain't you, Jonesy?

40:11.125 --> 40:12.375
No!

40:15.709 --> 40:17.083
Jonesy!

40:17.166 --> 40:19.417
No! Help me!

40:20.250 --> 40:22.000
I said hold her down!

40:36.417 --> 40:37.959
Jonsey!

41:01.333 --> 41:03.208
Let her be, Jonesy.

41:03.291 --> 41:04.917
What's wrong with her?

41:08.959 --> 41:10.166
(Pierce)
'Get up!'

41:12.917 --> 41:16.417
Hey, I said get up!

41:38.875 --> 41:40.250
Sadie?

41:45.083 --> 41:46.333
Sadie?

42:42.208 --> 42:45.083
Sadie was a lady.
