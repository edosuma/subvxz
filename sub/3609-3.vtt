00:02.003 --> 00:03.743
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.838 --> 00:07.171
Each one of us
was brought here for a reason.

00:07.258 --> 00:09.874
- And who brought us here, John?
- The island.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.502
It's destiny.

00:12.597 --> 00:16.806
You and your partner will observe a
psychological experiment in progress.

00:16.893 --> 00:20.511
Your duty is to observe team members
in another station on the island.

00:20.605 --> 00:23.187
These team members are not aware
that they are under surveillance,

00:23.274 --> 00:25.185
or they are subjects
of an experiment.

00:25.276 --> 00:30.191
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

00:30.281 --> 00:32.317
is as useless as that button!

00:33.284 --> 00:36.196
As long as we push it,
we'll never be free! [groaning]

00:36.287 --> 00:39.529
If you're sure it's not real,
then stop pushing the button.

00:39.624 --> 00:44.618
Well, l have, except, unfortunately,
someone else decided to start.

00:45.171 --> 00:47.708
Tomorrow we're gonna
find out what happens

00:47.798 --> 00:50.289
if that button doesn't get pushed.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.423
- [alarm buzzing]
- [mechanical groaning]

00:57.934 --> 00:58.969
John!

00:59.060 --> 01:03.099
Who is he, Box Man?
The man out there pounding on the door.

01:03.189 --> 01:05.726
His name is Mr. Eko.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.478
Why does Mr. Eko carry a stick
covered in scripture?

01:08.569 --> 01:09.775
Because he's a priest.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.816
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.898
It's all bloody real!
Push the button!

01:14.992 --> 01:16.732
No!

01:16.827 --> 01:19.910
- You've killed us all.
- No. ljust saved us all.

01:25.127 --> 01:28.335
[woman] System failure.
System failure.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.044
l was wrong.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.692
[footsteps approaching]

02:06.377 --> 02:07.617
[gasping, struggling]

02:32.028 --> 02:33.609
[branch snapping]

03:01.474 --> 03:03.260
When did John get back?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.020
And what's he doing?

03:14.403 --> 03:16.860
Where's he been?
Where's everyone else?

03:16.947 --> 03:18.812
Don't you think you should find out?

03:26.874 --> 03:31.117
So you're gone for a whole day...
after a massive hatch detonation.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.129
You don't call.
You don't write.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.875
Sorry, am | interrupting something?

03:43.641 --> 03:46.883
What? You... can't speak, John?

03:47.311 --> 03:48.391
You're mute?

03:51.315 --> 03:52.771
I am sorry about that.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.020
So, where are Eko and Desmond?

03:55.111 --> 03:58.820
Are they off being mute
and building structures as well?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.026
I know. You can't speak.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.486
You need to speak...
to me?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.282
What do you wanna...?

04:11.335 --> 04:13.451
The sand?
You need to speak to the sand?

04:15.631 --> 04:19.089
Trees. Yeah, I've heard they're
wonderful conversationalists.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.507
Hey!

04:21.929 --> 04:24.045
I don't understand.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.426
Who do you need to speak to?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.518
The... church?

04:28.978 --> 04:30.718
The sky.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.312
Island.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.693
Island?

04:40.906 --> 04:43.648
You need to speak to the island?

05:04.221 --> 05:04.255
[indistinct chatter]

05:04.263 --> 05:06.595
[indistinct chatter]

05:18.194 --> 05:20.276
"I need your help."

05:20.362 --> 05:22.694
Since when do you need my help?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.662
"I need you to stand guard."

05:36.837 --> 05:39.078
Yeah, so you can talk to the island.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.130
Sounds dangerous.

05:42.218 --> 05:46.177
Well, amusing as the "mute game"
invariably is,

05:46.430 --> 05:49.593
you are aware, John, that
I detest you, aren't you?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.852
You do remember
repeatedly punching me in the face

05:54.939 --> 05:57.430
and accusing me of using heroin
when I was not?

06:01.278 --> 06:03.610
What the sodding hell
is a "sweat lodge?"

06:08.911 --> 06:12.244
[J‘ The Whiteley Brothers:
Feel Like Going Home]

06:37.398 --> 06:39.855
- Where you headed?
- Eureka.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.022
I can get you far as Bridgeville.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.649
Come on. Hop in. Come on.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.417
- My name's John.
- Eddie.

07:00.504 --> 07:02.165
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.210
- Nasty day to be hitching.
- That's for sure.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.210
You don't mind my asking,
what's in Eureka?

07:09.305 --> 07:12.513
I heard there was
some work there cutting timber.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.431
Oh, is that what you do?

07:14.518 --> 07:16.179
That might be what I do.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.103
All I know is that I had to get out
of where I came from.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.145
Mom's dead, Dad's a drunk.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.693
- Hey, look. The rain's passing.
- [police siren blares]

07:35.664 --> 07:37.040
What, did you rob a bank?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.374
Afraid so.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.671
[man] Could I see your license
and registration, please?

07:49.762 --> 07:51.969
- Was I speeding, officer?
- Taillight's out.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.349
Could you both please
step outta the vehicle?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.565
What do you got back here?

08:06.737 --> 08:08.227
Guns and groceries.

08:16.705 --> 08:21.495
The transaction logs and paperwork
is in the red notebook in that duffel.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.047
So are we free to go?

08:31.970 --> 08:35.303
I could still take you in
for picking up a hitchhiker.

08:35.391 --> 08:36.847
That's my uncle.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.469
I called him and he picked me up.

08:48.112 --> 08:50.319
Get outta here.

09:02.418 --> 09:05.660
So, what is with all the guns... uncle?

09:09.717 --> 09:14.006
Oh, I like the indoor fireplace.
That's very snazzy.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.630
What's that?

09:19.643 --> 09:22.885
You're not taking drugs,
are you, John?

09:23.772 --> 09:27.731
I only ask because of the strict
zero tolerance policy you've enacted,

09:27.818 --> 09:31.402
and I wouldn't want you to have to
start punching yourself in the face.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.237
I get it.
You go in your little magic hut,

09:38.328 --> 09:41.161
and I stand out here
in case you devolve into a monkey.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.832
"Don't come in." OK.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.039
OK. I get it.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.428
Hi, John.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.098
It's good to see you again.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.071
What's that, John?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.900
- [mouths silently]
- Oh...

11:01.620 --> 11:03.531
You're sorry.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.035
That's OK. But I was
the sacrifice the island demanded.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.128
Don't worry. You'll speak
when you have something worth saying.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.802
I'm here to help you
find your way again.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.130
So you can bring the family
back together.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.551
Come on.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.136
I wanna show you something.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.359
John.

11:42.619 --> 11:46.612
- You're gonna need that.
- [wheels squeaking]

12:01.305 --> 12:04.968
John, someone in this airport's
in serious danger.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.891
You're the only one
who can save them.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.519
Not them. They'll be fine...
for a while.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.241
I think Sayid's got it.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.068
Next, please.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.422
Not Hurley.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.470
[chuckling]

12:47.684 --> 12:49.800
Forget it. He's helping himself.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.705
There's nothing you can do for them.
Not yet.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.631
You have to clean up your own mess.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.801
[sentence echoing]

13:42.906 --> 13:44.567
Come up here, John.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.836
[Boone] Clean it up, John.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.756
They've got him.
You don't have much time.

14:14.896 --> 14:15.885
[snarling]

14:18.942 --> 14:19.931
John!

14:22.612 --> 14:25.149
What happened?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.488
Are you all right?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.082
What are you doing?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.841
I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.577
- Eko's cross.
- He was dragged this way.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.923
Dragged?

15:24.007 --> 15:26.089
- By what?
- By the polar bear.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.919
Sawyer killed the polar bear.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.004
He killed "a" polar bear.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.953
What's that, John? Blood?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.621
I'm gonna go on alone,
you go back to Claire.

16:06.800 --> 16:11.339
- Well, I'll take my chances.
- You don't wanna go with me, Charlie.

16:11.429 --> 16:15.013
Bad things happen to people
who hang around with me.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.061
Hey, Bobby.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.024
[horn honking]

16:48.508 --> 16:50.009
What's that?

16:50.093 --> 16:52.584
That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.176
A What?

16:54.264 --> 16:57.347
Anybody who wants
can go in there and light a fire

16:57.434 --> 16:59.800
and get it nice and hot...
meditate.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.601
Then what?

17:01.688 --> 17:04.225
Then you figure out
what to do with your life...

17:04.316 --> 17:09.231
...what direction to take. Go in and
figure out if you're a farmer or hunter.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.567
So which are you, John?

17:16.953 --> 17:18.614
[woman laughing]

17:18.705 --> 17:21.788
- [man] Hey, John.
- Hey, Mike, Jan, this is Eddie.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.915
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- Nice to meet you.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.873
Any friend of John's
is a friend of ours.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.128
John's a very special guy.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.968
Grab a spot.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.006
So, you like Geronimo Jackson?

17:39.100 --> 17:42.558
Uh... They're all right.
It's my dad's old shirt.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.393
Your dad has excellent taste.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.104
Listen up, people.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.689
John brought a guest to supper.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.567
- Everyone, this is Eddie.
- Hey, Eddie.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.319
Eddie, this is everyone.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.157
- Nice to meet you.
- John, you wanna say some grace?

18:01.248 --> 18:02.954
Yeah.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.952
Thank you, Lord.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.663
Thank you for the food and the friends.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.628
And thanks for the rain today,

18:14.719 --> 18:17.586
so that Adam'll stop grumbling
about the droughts.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.012
[all chuckle]

18:19.599 --> 18:23.137
And for me, thank you for helping me
stop being so angry.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.103
And for... helping me...

18:27.190 --> 18:29.476
...find a real family.

18:32.904 --> 18:36.817
They're a hell of a lot better than the
one I used to have. So, let's eat. Amen.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.775
- [all] Amen.
- [Jan] Let's dig in.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.324
- Potatoes?
- Thank you.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.541
Thank you.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.976
- [Charlie] Is that the hatch?
- [Locke] What's left of it.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.070
What happened?

19:18.074 --> 19:20.690
Looks like it imploded.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.012
- Whoa.
- Shh.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.611
What's that?

19:58.698 --> 20:01.280
It's an active kill.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.984
Whatever was eating this
is gonna be back for more.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.492
If you wanna say "polar bear,"
you can just say it.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.287
All right. "Polar bear."

20:16.091 --> 20:18.377
- [animal growling]
- [leaves rustling]

20:18.468 --> 20:19.958
Run!

20:20.637 --> 20:23.128
[animal snarling]

20:43.368 --> 20:44.448
[man yells]

20:56.506 --> 20:57.837
Dude.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.302
They kept Jack, Kate, and Sawyer,

21:04.389 --> 21:08.428
and they sent me back to tell everyone
else that we can't ever go over there.

21:09.978 --> 21:13.015
Oh, and that dude
we had in the hatch, Henry...

21:13.273 --> 21:15.810
...he was there,
he's like their leader.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.526
So... what do we do?

21:24.868 --> 21:28.201
Do what they told you. Go back
to the camp and tell the others.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.030
- You're not gonna do anything?
- I am doing something.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.958
- Go back to the beach, Hugo.
- Wait. Where are you guys going?

21:35.044 --> 21:38.377
The island told Locke
he has to save Eko.

21:38.465 --> 21:42.799
- Save him from what?
- Well, apparently a bear's got him.

21:42.886 --> 21:46.754
It just made an active kill.
You may wanna hustle.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.264
Bear?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.765
What bear?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.784
[Charlie] What is that? More fur?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.989
This way.

22:20.882 --> 22:23.294
You know, when I used to get high,

22:23.384 --> 22:25.636
I'd watch nature programs on the Beeb.

22:26.888 --> 22:30.176
Polar bears are meant to be
quite clever. Very clever.

22:30.683 --> 22:35.097
They're like the Einsteins
of the bear community.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.788
- She likes you, man.
- Shut up.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.589
- Yeah, she does.
- She does not.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.009
- Yeah, she does.
- She's half my age, man.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.882
- You'd be better off with her.
- No.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.055
Lizzie's too granola for me.

23:12.141 --> 23:16.384
What she really wants is a daddy,
like everyone else here.

23:16.479 --> 23:20.472
- You should take advantage of that.
- That's not really funny, Eddie.

23:21.693 --> 23:25.106
It was a joke. I'm sorry.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.737
How come you never talk
about your dad?

23:32.495 --> 23:35.157
Nothing worth talking about.

23:39.836 --> 23:43.328
What's going on
in that greenhouse over there?

23:44.674 --> 23:48.166
- They need a hand with that fertilizer.
- No. They're OK.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.297
Come on. We got orchard duty.

23:58.354 --> 24:02.313
- What's the big secret, John?
- Sorry?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.437
The greenhouse.
What do you guys got in there?

24:05.862 --> 24:09.229
Every time I go near it,
you and everyone else acts all weird.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.280
You're a guest, things take time.

24:11.367 --> 24:14.029
I've been here for six weeks.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.111
I'm not blind, man.

24:16.205 --> 24:19.288
Did you forget you had
a bag of guns when you brought me here?

24:19.375 --> 24:23.288
Mike and Jan welcomed you here
with open arms. They feed you.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.371
- They give you a place to stay.
- And Mike and Jan

24:26.466 --> 24:30.300
fold their hands every night before chow
and talk about how we're family,

24:30.386 --> 24:33.093
your family's got too many secrets.

24:33.556 --> 24:37.048
Now, I see the fertilizer
going into that greenhouse.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.850
I know what's going on...

24:39.937 --> 24:41.143
...and Iwant in.

24:42.398 --> 24:46.141
- In on what?
- Whatever you are trying to blow up.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.403
What's so funny?

24:55.620 --> 24:57.156
Nothing.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.742
I'll talk to Mike and Jan.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.673
You really think Eko's in there?

25:15.932 --> 25:19.174
Let's hurry up, maybe the bear's
out finishing his lunch.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.759
- You're not going in there, Charlie.
- What?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.019
I'm gonna do this alone.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.849
Don't tell me what I can't do!
If I want to go, I'll go.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.150
- Why?
- What?

25:29.237 --> 25:32.024
- Why do you wanna go in there?
- I don't need a reason!

25:32.782 --> 25:36.525
- Then go back.
- You don't have a good reason, either!

25:36.619 --> 25:40.328
I'm going in there
because I'm supposed to go in there.

25:44.252 --> 25:47.744
If it all goes to plan, we probably
won't even see the bear, will we?

25:47.839 --> 25:50.125
And hopefully he won't smell us.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.385
Hairspray? Now, I hate to be the one
to point this out to you...

25:56.472 --> 25:58.008
It's not for me.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.981
[inhaling deeply]

26:40.933 --> 26:42.924
[branches snapping]

26:46.731 --> 26:51.566
- [leaves rustling]
- Bear?

26:53.321 --> 26:55.107
Is that you?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.197
- [branch snapping]
- Who's there?

26:58.493 --> 27:00.199
[Desmond] Are you alone, brother?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.200
Yeah.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.660
Whoa! Dude! I'm not alone.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.837
Beach camp's right over there.
Can you get me some clothes?

27:12.924 --> 27:14.255
What happened to yours?

27:17.595 --> 27:20.382
I woke up in the jungle like this.

27:20.932 --> 27:24.390
So... like, the hatch...

27:26.604 --> 27:28.185
...blew off your underwear?

27:29.774 --> 27:32.811
Fine. You wanna discuss this in
great detail right now?

27:32.902 --> 27:35.814
- Then, let's do it.
- No, that's OK. I got something here.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.570
How do you feel about tie-dye?

28:16.612 --> 28:18.603
[metal object clanging]

28:37.967 --> 28:42.381
[whistling] Hey, Kim.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.553
Hey, Mike and Jan in?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.847
Yeah. They were looking for you.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.434
Good, good. Good timing then?

28:52.982 --> 28:54.472
Go on in.

28:56.986 --> 28:59.147
- [Mike] Got all the cash?
- [Jan] In the bag.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.570
- [Mike] Which bag?
- [Jan] The one with the money!

29:01.657 --> 29:03.522
- What about bank records?
- Leave 'em.

29:03.618 --> 29:06.576
- Should we sort what they can trace?
- There is no time, Mike.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.243
What's going on?

29:08.331 --> 29:09.946
What does it look like?

29:10.166 --> 29:11.372
[mumbling]

29:12.627 --> 29:15.243
You screwed up, John.
You blew it big time.

29:16.839 --> 29:17.828
[stuttering]

29:20.509 --> 29:22.170
What are you doing?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.842
Are you leaving?

29:23.930 --> 29:26.672
- Why?
- That is why, you idiot!

29:26.766 --> 29:30.509
[Mike] Your friend's a cop. You know
how much time we'd get for this?

29:30.603 --> 29:35.267
- Nice picture, fresh out of academy.
- He was hitchhiking.

29:35.358 --> 29:38.441
- He told me he was going to Eureka.
- [Jan] He was waiting for you!

29:38.527 --> 29:42.611
He has been here for six weeks gathering
evidence because you brought him here!

29:42.698 --> 29:46.282
- That's impossible.
- He played you for a sucker. It's over.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.951
No. Wait.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.659
Wait, no, wait, wait. Stop!

29:54.502 --> 29:57.790
We don't know what he's told them.
He hasn't even been in here yet.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.963
If he's gathering evidence
to make a case, it's not too late.

30:01.050 --> 30:04.008
- Not too late for what?
- To protect all of us.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.176
It's not too late to fix this.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.132
I can fix this.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.883
How are you gonna do that? Huh?

30:44.593 --> 30:45.924
[gasping]

30:46.012 --> 30:47.001
Eko.

30:48.723 --> 30:49.963
John...

30:53.436 --> 30:54.642
[rustling]

30:55.271 --> 30:57.637
[animal snarling]

31:03.612 --> 31:04.692
[growling]

31:11.078 --> 31:12.943
[bellowing]

31:22.131 --> 31:24.668
[gasping]

31:28.429 --> 31:29.965
Is he OK?

31:30.056 --> 31:31.796
Is he alive?
Is he all right?

31:31.891 --> 31:34.849
- He's alive.
- Turn him over.

31:35.436 --> 31:39.145
- We gotta get outta here.
- OK. Let's get him up.

31:46.739 --> 31:51.073
So, when you say "turned a key,"
you mean like a "key" key?

31:51.160 --> 31:53.071
It was a fail-safe key.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.321
That seems kind of convenient.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.575
I'm sorry?

31:57.666 --> 32:02.410
If you had this magic key
the whole time, why didn't you use it?

32:02.505 --> 32:05.463
- I didn't know what would happen.
- What did happen?

32:05.549 --> 32:09.337
Well, the fail-safe key must've
detonated the electromagnetic anomaly,

32:09.428 --> 32:11.419
made the hatch implode.

32:11.514 --> 32:13.550
But you didn't implode.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.223
No.

32:17.228 --> 32:20.095
You're not gonna...
turn into The Hulk or something?

32:22.691 --> 32:26.400
So is that what made the blender
noise and the sky turn purple?

32:26.487 --> 32:28.193
I'm afraid I missed that.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.941
Right, you were fail-safing.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.650
Well, FYI, the whole island vibrated.

32:33.744 --> 32:37.453
Kate, Jack and Sawyer saw it before
they had bags pulled over their heads.

32:37.540 --> 32:40.953
Don't worry.
Locke's gonna go after them.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.625
- He said so in his speech.
- What?

32:45.673 --> 32:47.334
What speech?

32:47.424 --> 32:51.167
All he said was he was gonna
save Eko and kill bears.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.799
Right.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.471
Right, of course.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.676
I'm sorry. I...

33:00.855 --> 33:02.516
...I'm just a bit shook up.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.988
I burned that bear pretty good.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.695
I don't think
he's gonna be coming after us.

33:19.790 --> 33:23.374
Now that we've survived
this suicide mission...

33:23.460 --> 33:25.496
...do you wanna tell me
what you saw?

33:25.588 --> 33:28.625
- What I saw?
- In your spirit tent.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.458
I saw Boone.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.419
Boone?

33:37.558 --> 33:39.890
What did he have to say for himself?

33:39.977 --> 33:41.933
Told me I had to clean up my own mess.

33:42.271 --> 33:45.013
Well... dead as he may be,

33:45.733 --> 33:47.189
I agree with Boone.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.983
If you kept pressing that
button like Eko told you...

33:50.070 --> 33:54.439
We wouldn't have had to save him, that's
what cleaning up your own mess means.

33:58.120 --> 34:01.032
Spoken like someone who's had
many messes to clean.

34:13.135 --> 34:15.922
- No deer?
- Nope.

34:18.599 --> 34:21.261
You talk to Mike and Jan yet?

34:21.352 --> 34:24.719
- Yeah, sure did.
- What did they say?

34:25.731 --> 34:27.722
They said that I should

34:27.816 --> 34:31.775
bring you by the greenhouse tonight
and that they would explain everything.

34:31.862 --> 34:35.320
Cool. That's great.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.317
What? You see something?

34:43.499 --> 34:45.205
John.

34:52.466 --> 34:56.175
- What are you doing?
- Did you know it would be me?

34:56.804 --> 34:58.419
- What?
- In the truck.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.927
Did you know it would be me driving?

35:02.017 --> 35:03.268
Did they choose me?

35:04.186 --> 35:06.928
"They"? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.432
I didn't load that one.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.317
So just answer the question, Eddie.

35:18.492 --> 35:21.825
Yeah. They chose you, John.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.031
VVhy?

35:27.126 --> 35:30.038
You hadn't been here long,
didn't have a criminal record,

35:30.129 --> 35:33.667
and the psych profile
said you would be amenable for coercion.

35:36.385 --> 35:40.845
- "Amenable for coercion"?
- Hey! Lower the gun, John.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.715
OK? This isn't personal.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.266
What's not personal?

35:53.235 --> 35:54.441
Stop, stop.

35:54.528 --> 35:58.521
I'm sorry, John, but you're not gonna
shoot me. You're not a murderer.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.987
You're a good man.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.488
You're a farmer.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.325
Nope.

36:07.416 --> 36:09.907
Not a farmer.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.330
I was a hunter.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.002
[exhaling deeply]

36:14.089 --> 36:16.045
I'm a hunter.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.882
I'm gonna walk away now, John.

36:39.114 --> 36:42.231
[water running]

36:46.163 --> 36:47.994
You hear something?

36:50.250 --> 36:52.377
- It sounds like a stream.
- Yeah.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.452
Put him down.
Maybe we can get some water in him.

37:08.811 --> 37:11.302
I'll go. You stay here.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.451
I'm sorry.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.037
Sorry I ever doubted you.

37:35.129 --> 37:37.370
Sorry I...

37:37.464 --> 37:40.001
...gave up on my faith in the island.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.720
I messed up.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.847
Now our people are captured and...

37:51.812 --> 37:53.723
...if I'd just listened to you...

37:53.814 --> 37:57.102
...if I'd just let you
keep pushing the button...

37:59.778 --> 38:02.190
I could've gone with 'em,

38:02.281 --> 38:04.192
protected 'em.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.445
I could've saved 'em.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.245
You can still protect them.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.420
You can still save them.

38:27.681 --> 38:29.467
I don't even know where they are.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.640
You will find them.

38:35.439 --> 38:39.557
After all, you are a hunter, John.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.865
- You say something?
- He's awake. Eko?

39:07.262 --> 39:10.425
Maybe we should just...
get him back, John.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.516
Yeah.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.931
- [Charlie] You all right?
- Yeah, just keep walking.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.225
John? Charlie?

39:24.780 --> 39:26.486
- What happened?
- We got him.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.739
- Is he alive?
- We need Jack.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.662
- [Locke] Take him in.
- Jack's not coming back.

39:32.746 --> 39:35.328
- They've got him.
- What are you talking about?

39:35.415 --> 39:38.373
- Jack's gone?
- [woman] I don't understand.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.873
- When were you planning on telling us?
- What do you mean, who's "they?"

39:41.964 --> 39:45.377
"They" are the Others.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.583
And, yes, they've taken Jack.

39:47.678 --> 39:50.385
And Kate and Sawyer.

39:50.472 --> 39:53.839
- How? What happened?
- What about Sun, Jin and Sayid?

39:53.934 --> 39:55.424
I don't know.

39:56.645 --> 39:59.182
I'm gonna find our friends.

40:00.941 --> 40:03.148
I don't know how yet, but I will.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.025
We're gonna find them, all of them.

40:06.113 --> 40:07.978
And then we're gonna bring them home.

40:10.492 --> 40:14.986
But first, we gotta look after Mr. Eko.
Paulo, Nikki, bring towels and water.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.664
We gotta clean him up, bring all the
first aid supplies you can find.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.293
Not a bad speech.

40:33.599 --> 40:35.180
Whoa.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.636
VVhoa?

40:39.813 --> 40:41.349
I just got hit with...

40:47.613 --> 40:49.149
...déja vu.

40:53.535 --> 40:55.776
Well... when that wears off,

40:55.871 --> 40:59.329
can you get bandages
from the kitchen?
