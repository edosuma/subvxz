WEBVTT

00:54.589 --> 00:57.291
- Are you from Toronto?
- Yeah.

01:25.285 --> 01:26.219
Thank you.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.786
Hi!

01:58.820 --> 02:01.488
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God, hi!

02:04.491 --> 02:07.862
- Oh, my God, look at you.
- Hey, you. Mom.

02:09.429 --> 02:14.134
Hey. I missed you. Aw.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.508
Oh, stop.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.677
- Mm, Mom.
- Okay.

02:22.710 --> 02:23.911
- Looks good.
- Yeah.

02:23.945 --> 02:25.847
You look great, Mom.

02:25.880 --> 02:26.848
Thank you.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.616
- So do you.
- Oh, thanks.

02:29.717 --> 02:33.788
Well, you know, I'm far
from my twilight years, right?

02:34.889 --> 02:37.592
You know, Mom's been actually
auditioning for theater stuff again.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.327
- Oh, really? That's awesome.
- Mm-hm.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.564
Well, you know, theater's
addictive. It's like a drug.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.368
- Thank you.
- Once it gets into your veins,

02:48.402 --> 02:50.605
- you just have to keep doing it.
- Can't get enough.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.709
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.844
- Can you pass me a piece of bread?
- Oh, yeah.

02:56.878 --> 02:59.212
So, we, uh,
we followed you on Instagram.

02:59.981 --> 03:02.684
You went to so many places.
What was your favorite?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.888
Oh, that's hard to say. I, um,

03:06.921 --> 03:09.456
I really liked India,
actually... well.

03:09.489 --> 03:12.492
Yeah, all, yeah,
Cambodia was great, Thailand.

03:12.527 --> 03:15.395
I actually was teaching yoga
in between writing.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.666
And I got to teach right
outside the ruins in Thailand.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.668
- Wow.
- Yeah.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.537
- It's pretty crazy.
- Wow.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.306
So, were you able to make a
living off of teaching yoga there?

03:26.339 --> 03:27.307
Yeah, mostly.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.310
Wha... what's mostly?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.682
I don't know,
just some other jobs too.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.185
Well, like what?

03:41.055 --> 03:42.924
What about your writing,
your play?

03:43.958 --> 03:47.795
Nothing, I'm just kind of...
just stuck, you know.

03:47.829 --> 03:51.431
It's been two years
and I can't... figure it out.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.001
You know what your father used
to do when he was stuck writing?

03:54.035 --> 03:56.971
- What?
- He would listen

03:57.004 --> 03:59.574
to really loud
heavy metal music.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.476
- What?
- Yeah.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.945
Don't do the same thing,
okay, because...

04:03.978 --> 04:07.014
I, I, I forgot to put
napkins on the table.

04:12.452 --> 04:13.688
Mom seems good.

04:14.589 --> 04:17.792
Yeah, she is, I mean,
most of the time.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.694
You know, it's just
every once in a while...

04:19.727 --> 04:21.428
Because in your messages
just you made it sound

04:21.461 --> 04:22.530
like there was a problem.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.933
Well, some days.

04:31.806 --> 04:33.708
It's, uh,
Mom's birthday coming up soon.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.376
Mm, we should do
something for her

04:36.409 --> 04:37.678
like a plan, go for dinner.

04:39.412 --> 04:40.982
Well, I don't know about that.
I mean,

04:41.015 --> 04:43.818
I'm a student and everything,
right, so.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.887
We'll make a reservation.

04:45.920 --> 04:50.390
Uh, we're kind of short on
money... is what I'm saying.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.661
So, I was thinking that
we could do something at home.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.695
- Yeah.
- You know, have a little

04:54.729 --> 04:56.097
- party or.
- Let's do that.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.832
Yeah, we'll have
like a nice dinner here.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.366
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

05:00.802 --> 05:01.969
Thanks, Mom.

05:06.373 --> 05:09.442
- I can't believe you're here.
- I know, yeah.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.478
Yeah, me neither.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.671
Remember this day?

05:39.974 --> 05:42.109
You stuck your foot
in the spokes.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.377
Yeah.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.516
Gosh, Mom and Dad were like
local celebrities, weren't they?

05:48.549 --> 05:52.452
The writer and the actress.

05:52.485 --> 05:53.688
Envy of the town.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.523
Yeah.

05:57.158 --> 05:59.093
Do you think she misses him?

05:59.126 --> 06:00.528
Mm-hm.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.633
This was the last photo
taken of him.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.970
Look how young we are.
We're just kids.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.611
Oh, stop it, silly!

06:16.644 --> 06:18.779
So, tell me, so,
tell me about your travels.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.515
Like, like, what was,
what was the most, I don't know,

06:21.549 --> 06:23.651
exciting or like crazy
thing that happened?

06:24.652 --> 06:28.455
- Well, I met a boy.
- Really? Okay.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.157
- His name was Oscar.
- Yeah.

06:30.191 --> 06:32.492
He was from South America.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.794
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.630
And, um, I don't know.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.566
We just traveled around together
and did everything together.

06:39.567 --> 06:44.437
It was super disorganized,
but he was kind of cute.

06:44.471 --> 06:45.773
- Yeah.
- Cool.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.541
So, I don't know.
Maybe I'll go there

06:47.575 --> 06:49.977
or maybe he'll come here,
but we'll figure it out.

06:51.979 --> 06:52.980
Wow.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.958
Don't worry.
I'm not leaving anytime soon.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.997
Cut it out.

07:37.825 --> 07:41.963
I just want to give the soil one
last hand before winter arrives.

07:41.996 --> 07:44.865
You know, I always do this,
keep it aerated.

07:44.899 --> 07:47.668
Until the snow comes, then the
moisture can seep in and freeze.

07:51.172 --> 07:53.040
So nice to have you home,
sweetheart.

07:57.979 --> 08:00.781
I love being outside.

08:00.815 --> 08:03.250
My little plot
of land in the city.

08:03.284 --> 08:05.186
I don't know
what I would have done if I...

08:05.219 --> 08:07.688
couldn't step out here
every year and...

08:07.722 --> 08:09.857
plant something
and help it grow and...

08:11.726 --> 08:15.629
water the vegetables and...
watch them rise and rise.

08:20.735 --> 08:22.770
What do you think you'll do
now that you're here?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.139
I don't know. Help you and Sara.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.274
Go and find a job.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.211
Get my life back together.

08:32.213 --> 08:34.915
Maybe you and Sara could write
new music together.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.623
Mom, you all right?

08:43.858 --> 08:47.028
- I'm going to get us some water, would you like some?
- Yeah, sure.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.265
- Yeah, I'll finish it.
- Yeah, this is not real work.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.933
That's garden until over there.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.001
Okay. Yeah.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.571
This plant's going
to thrive next year, Mom.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.366
Wow, that was fast.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.235
You see, two daughters
are further than one.

10:34.268 --> 10:36.237
- Yeah.
- Here's some water.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.808
Actually, we should get going.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.779
I told Sara we'd meet at the
farmer's market after her class.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.348
Okay, thanks.

10:55.756 --> 10:59.960
- It looks really yummy.
- It looks so good.

10:59.994 --> 11:01.428
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

11:01.462 --> 11:04.064
- This looks delicious.
- Yeah.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.900
Well, Mom knows everybody here.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.435
Well, Sara and I come
here every week.

11:08.469 --> 11:10.204
We should think about seeing
if one of the bakers

11:10.237 --> 11:12.106
wants to take your biscotti.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.841
- Everybody loves it.
- That's a great idea.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.876
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:15.910 --> 11:18.145
Don't you think
people might find it weird,

11:18.179 --> 11:22.483
an Aussie of Italian descent
selling biscotti in Canada?

11:24.185 --> 11:26.854
- I don't know, it's multicultural.
- Yeah.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.024
I don't know, it'll be good,
yeah. People will love it.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.425
And are you going
to help with production

11:31.458 --> 11:33.827
or are you just
going to get rich from me?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.996
- Yeah, filthy rich.
- We're going to eat them.

11:36.030 --> 11:39.867
Yeah. We'll be the
Bill Gates of, uh, biscotti.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.236
We could call it bisc-Aussies.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.138
Oh, my God, that's, uh,
horrible.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.081
- I'm going to go rest for a while.
- Okay.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.884
Just get me up later, so I,
I'll help with dinner.

11:56.917 --> 11:57.785
All right.

11:59.019 --> 12:02.856
Hey. I want to show you
something.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.097
Okay.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.934
- Open it.
- What's this?

12:13.968 --> 12:15.469
Where'd you find this?

12:15.503 --> 12:18.072
I literally dug it up
in the garden.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.344
- Wow.
- Isn't it crazy?

12:23.377 --> 12:24.945
These are beautiful.

12:30.884 --> 12:33.854
- When did you find this?
- Just this morning.

12:36.558 --> 12:38.459
- They are love letters.
- I know.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.094
Wow.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.229
There's no signatures
or anything, but there's...

12:43.264 --> 12:44.765
there's initials.

12:48.536 --> 12:49.837
Do you think they are to Mom?

12:53.841 --> 12:56.277
Uh, this house
has been here a long time

12:56.310 --> 12:59.113
so could've been anyone's.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.983
It was buried in our backyard.
Could totally be Mom's.

13:03.017 --> 13:05.085
Oh, I don't know,
they don't look like...

13:06.588 --> 13:09.290
- they are hers and if they were hers, you know...
- Why...

13:09.323 --> 13:11.125
...then if she buried them,
she buried them

13:11.158 --> 13:13.193
for a reason, right? So.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.997
Obviously she wants to, uh,
leave them underground.

13:18.132 --> 13:20.401
I feel like someone made these
for her. They are beautiful.

13:20.434 --> 13:22.604
Well, if she forgot about them,
and then she buried them

13:22.637 --> 13:26.006
for a reason, and if we dig
them up and show them to her,

13:26.040 --> 13:28.175
then that could be
really upsetting for her.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.277
Well, not unless
she wanted to remember.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.580
Yeah, but what if these were
written when Dad was alive?

13:33.581 --> 13:35.249
Yeah, and what if they weren't?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.353
I don't really think
it's a good idea.

13:40.888 --> 13:45.225
It's this beautiful mystery of the
past that doesn't have to be explained.

15:26.561 --> 15:28.730
Hey, sorry I'm late.

15:28.763 --> 15:31.331
It's okay, I'm used to it.
You're always late.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.535
Yeah, bad habit, I know.

15:33.568 --> 15:36.136
Mm, thank you. Yeah.

15:38.673 --> 15:43.210
I love the fall, the autumn when
it changes like this, it's...

15:45.012 --> 15:47.247
- it's so beautiful.
- Me too.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.186
- How are your studies?
- Good, really good.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.321
You remember what
I'm focusing on, right?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.758
Early 20th century
French Impressionism,

15:56.791 --> 16:00.728
so Erik Satie, Debussy, Forain.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.731
Especially Erik Satie.

16:03.765 --> 16:06.033
- Mm, major, yeah.
- He's incredible.

16:07.702 --> 16:12.339
You know, sometimes I wish
I was living in that time.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.209
You know,
Paris early 20th century

16:15.242 --> 16:16.644
when all of that beautiful
music was

16:16.678 --> 16:18.412
coming out for the first time,
you know?

16:19.480 --> 16:22.416
It was so exciting, so fresh.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.219
Hm.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.225
So, what's wrong?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.700
- Oscar proposed to me.
- What?

16:38.733 --> 16:39.701
By email.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.104
- Email?
- Yeah, email.

16:44.839 --> 16:47.341
- Email's...
- Yeah, lousy.

16:47.374 --> 16:51.245
Well, what are you going to say?

16:52.847 --> 16:55.683
- I don't know.
- Well, are you happy?

16:57.184 --> 17:00.053
Ugh, I don't... yes, I don't
know, I don't know, I'm...

17:01.856 --> 17:05.693
You know, things always work out
for you. I'm so jealous.

17:05.727 --> 17:08.630
That is not true.
I haven't even said yes yet.

17:08.663 --> 17:10.765
Yeah, but you're going to and
then you're going to be married,

17:10.798 --> 17:13.200
and you're going
to be happily ever after.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.203
No, it's marriage.
Are you kidding?

17:16.236 --> 17:19.072
Love is like
a sickness, it's...

17:19.106 --> 17:21.141
People just use you.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.442
People are selfish.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.211
You can't just put
yourself fully into it.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.713
I disagree.

17:25.747 --> 17:27.749
You have to put
all of yourself into it,

17:27.782 --> 17:31.118
every ounce of your soul,
otherwise it's meaningless.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.555
- No, but I mean...
- Love is passion, like.

17:33.588 --> 17:36.356
- No.
- You have to have passion otherwise what are you doing?

17:36.390 --> 17:39.661
No, because, Sara, then
it just burns you, you know?

17:39.694 --> 17:42.129
Love just burns you,
that's what happens.

17:52.406 --> 17:54.474
- It's actually interesting stuff to...
- April.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.311
- Hi.
- Oh, Mark!

17:57.344 --> 17:58.780
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh, hi!

17:58.813 --> 18:00.180
Well, it's been.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.849
- What, like five?
- Oh, my God.

18:01.883 --> 18:04.586
- Oh, uh, yeah, eight years.
- Eight years?

18:04.619 --> 18:06.486
- Eight years.
- Eight, yeah.

18:06.521 --> 18:08.656
Wow, so that means you have
the adult braces off.

18:08.690 --> 18:10.858
Oh.

18:10.892 --> 18:14.494
Uh, yeah. They are...
Sorry, this is my sister, Sara.

18:14.529 --> 18:16.564
- I don't think you have met her.
- Hey, Sara, hi, how are you?

18:16.598 --> 18:17.632
Nice to meet you. Yeah.

18:17.665 --> 18:19.499
So, I mean, look,

18:19.534 --> 18:21.201
what,
what have you been doing lately?

18:21.234 --> 18:22.904
- Uh, teaching actually.
- Yoga?

18:22.937 --> 18:26.507
I see you on Facebook sometimes.
You were in India traveling.

18:26.541 --> 18:28.710
Yeah, I was there for two years
and...

18:28.743 --> 18:32.479
I decided I needed to come back.
I got homesick.

18:33.715 --> 18:35.617
- Uh, you, what are you doing?
- Oh, God.

18:35.650 --> 18:37.819
Well, I, I quit my job and,
uh...

18:37.852 --> 18:39.419
- Wow.
- ...yeah, I, uh...

18:40.320 --> 18:43.156
I realized working in
television was soul-sucking,

18:43.190 --> 18:46.226
so I went back to school
and started painting

18:46.259 --> 18:49.631
and studying part time and now
I'm exhibiting at galleries.

18:49.664 --> 18:51.465
- And, uh, yeah.
- Wow, that's awesome.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.467
I have a studio
right near the park here.

18:53.501 --> 18:55.637
- You, you should come by and visit.
- Yeah.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.404
Yeah? Look, I, I have to run,

18:57.437 --> 19:00.775
but, um, here's my card,
my number's on it.

19:00.808 --> 19:02.844
- Okay, thanks.
- Call me and, uh,

19:02.877 --> 19:05.780
we'll, um, if you want we'll
have coffee and just catch up.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.915
- You know.
- Yeah, yeah, I would love that, yeah.

19:07.949 --> 19:11.218
- Okay, all right. Nice to meet you, okay.
- Nice to meet you, yeah.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.285
- Take care.
- Bye.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.154
- See you.
- Bye.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.392
Oh, my God.

19:27.869 --> 19:29.904
So, who was that?

19:29.937 --> 19:31.606
Mark.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.708
Yeah, but who's Mark?

19:34.642 --> 19:37.779
He was my first real adult love.

19:39.681 --> 19:41.415
First person
who told me he loved me.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.386
So, what happened?

19:48.255 --> 19:52.794
After he told me, he sold
his house and moved to LA.

19:56.030 --> 19:56.898
Wow.

20:00.434 --> 20:01.803
You really loved him.

20:03.437 --> 20:04.337
Yeah.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.407
Yeah, I really did.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.483
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

21:23.518 --> 21:25.418
Uh, good, thank you.

21:27.822 --> 21:28.790
- Um, I'm April.
- Yeah.

21:28.823 --> 21:29.757
How you doing?

21:29.791 --> 21:31.726
Yeah, I served for years,

21:31.759 --> 21:34.361
and then I used to work
at a cafe as well.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.952
You wouldn't have
a cigarette, would you?

21:57.985 --> 21:59.520
- I'm sorry.
- No?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.023
You want this coffee.

22:02.056 --> 22:04.559
Oh, thank you, sure.

22:07.562 --> 22:08.529
Do you mind if I sit?

22:09.597 --> 22:11.431
No, no.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.700
Sure, be my guest.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.778
Sure is getting colder, huh.

22:23.811 --> 22:26.647
Well, yeah,
you don't have to tell me.

22:27.949 --> 22:28.816
Ugh.

22:29.951 --> 22:33.521
But I have my own place,
I'm tough.

22:34.989 --> 22:37.058
I'd be here no matter
what the weather was like.

22:38.593 --> 22:39.927
I like benches.

22:41.796 --> 22:42.930
I like watching.

22:43.998 --> 22:48.803
I wrote a, a book of poems,
unpublished of course,

22:48.836 --> 22:51.172
called <i>Life from the Bench.</i>
Not life on a bench,

22:51.205 --> 22:54.775
but I wouldn't imply that I
spent my entire life on a bench,

22:54.809 --> 22:57.144
but <i>Life from the Bench.</i>
You can see so many things.

22:58.045 --> 23:02.850
I like to, you know,
observe more than participate.

23:02.884 --> 23:04.685
I guess my life would
have been different

23:04.719 --> 23:06.988
if I participated more.

23:12.093 --> 23:13.694
You see that guy over there?

23:15.663 --> 23:19.432
- Yes.
- I can tell you when he'd... go get his coffee.

23:20.167 --> 23:21.769
Twenty seven minutes from now.

23:22.837 --> 23:25.907
Twenty seven minutes from now
he'll walk down there.

23:25.940 --> 23:29.777
He'll get, get a large coffee,
and then I'll see him walk back.

23:33.114 --> 23:35.016
I guess we're all
creatures of habit.

23:36.717 --> 23:38.986
Change is hard,
change is a lot of work.

23:44.058 --> 23:45.693
You don't mind me just...

23:47.929 --> 23:49.897
- blathering on like this.
- No.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.103
I don't often
just talk to people.

23:58.973 --> 24:02.643
Don't you have any you know,
friends or family or...?

24:02.677 --> 24:04.679
Family, uh, no.

24:04.712 --> 24:06.047
It would have been nice
to have a family.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.015
I think I'd like
to have a daughter.

24:08.049 --> 24:11.185
I heard this guy
talking about daughters turn

24:11.218 --> 24:15.723
into their mothers,
but to him it was a negative.

24:15.756 --> 24:18.659
Probably talking
about his ex-wives.

24:18.693 --> 24:22.096
Uh, but a daughter would be
nice or even a son.

24:22.129 --> 24:23.496
But I think I daughter.

24:24.966 --> 24:27.501
- You remind me of someone.
- Oh, really?

24:27.535 --> 24:29.804
Yeah, Erik Satie.

24:30.771 --> 24:33.240
I like the name.
Was he handsome?

24:35.276 --> 24:38.846
Yeah, very handsome,
and a gentleman.

24:40.614 --> 24:44.618
He was a very private person,
but he seemed...

24:44.652 --> 24:47.021
very sensitive and aware.

24:48.556 --> 24:49.991
I'm studying him.
I'm wr... I'm writing

24:50.024 --> 24:52.126
my master's thesis
on him actually.

24:52.159 --> 24:55.763
And I, and I compose so I guess
in a way he's kind of my muse.

24:55.796 --> 25:00.167
He, he's the grandfather
of contemporary music, so.

25:00.201 --> 25:02.636
You know, he was going against
what had been established

25:02.670 --> 25:05.239
in music at that time
and in society.

25:05.272 --> 25:07.908
He was a part
of the avant-garde group

25:07.942 --> 25:09.944
- of artists in Paris.
- Avant-garde?

25:09.977 --> 25:12.747
Mm-hm. And, uh...

25:12.780 --> 25:14.215
I don't know,
he wrote these little ditties

25:14.248 --> 25:18.552
called "Les Gymnopédies,"
which he would play in this cafe

25:18.586 --> 25:20.921
on the Champs de Mars
for variety shows.

25:20.955 --> 25:23.724
And no one really knew
about them or cared

25:23.758 --> 25:25.693
until much later in his life,
you know and...

25:26.761 --> 25:28.763
I don't know, he seemed to live

25:28.796 --> 25:31.032
- many different lives in a way.
- Wow.

25:31.065 --> 25:33.167
- That's very interesting.
- Yeah.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.236
At, at one point
he had this stage

25:35.269 --> 25:39.707
where he would wear 12 identical
velvet suits.

25:39.740 --> 25:43.044
- That's a little bizarre.
- Yeah.

25:43.077 --> 25:45.946
And, and he had this mad, you
know, passionate love affair

25:45.980 --> 25:50.584
with this woman named, uh, this
female painter, Suzanne Valadon,

25:50.618 --> 25:53.354
who, you know, after six months,
just cut if off,

25:53.387 --> 25:55.656
left all of the sudden,
and he was heartbroken.

25:55.689 --> 25:57.058
And he never loved again.

25:58.192 --> 26:01.896
And, you know, he was drinking
or had things on and off

26:01.929 --> 26:04.098
and lived in smaller
and smaller apartments.

26:04.131 --> 26:07.802
And eventually when he died they
found hundreds of compositions

26:07.835 --> 26:09.837
stuffed in pillows
and floorboards,

26:09.870 --> 26:11.372
and in these two pianos
that he had

26:11.405 --> 26:13.841
one stacked on top of the other.

26:13.874 --> 26:16.243
All these works
that he had never completed.

26:17.144 --> 26:18.012
Wow.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.615
You're kind of a romantic.

26:24.018 --> 26:26.720
- I guess, yeah, in a way.
- But what would you...

26:26.754 --> 26:30.157
If he were here, what would you say to him?
What would you say to Erik?

26:32.960 --> 26:36.630
I... I guess I would tell him...

26:36.664 --> 26:39.700
you know,
that I'm proud of him...

26:40.835 --> 26:43.771
for living, you know,
his authenticity,

26:43.804 --> 26:45.606
his real self.

26:46.841 --> 26:48.309
- Wow.
- That he lived a...

26:48.342 --> 26:51.645
He lived a beautiful
life despite life,

26:51.679 --> 26:55.983
and that, you know,
his works touched many people.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.719
He, he survived
after all these years.

26:58.752 --> 27:02.890
I'm honored that you would
think of me in regard to him.

27:03.824 --> 27:07.061
You seem to have his properness.

27:07.094 --> 27:08.028
Proper.

27:09.797 --> 27:10.898
I'm hardly proper.

27:10.931 --> 27:12.433
But he would say

27:12.466 --> 27:14.034
the exact same thing.

27:18.172 --> 27:19.173
Here.

27:20.341 --> 27:23.444
I'd like
if you would take this, I.

27:23.477 --> 27:26.113
- Oh, no, I can't.
- No, please. I really don't need it.

27:27.081 --> 27:29.250
- If it pleases you.
- Yes, it would.

27:30.384 --> 27:32.153
What's your name, sir?

27:34.221 --> 27:35.456
Erik will do.

27:37.324 --> 27:39.026
Nice to meet you, Erik.

28:00.948 --> 28:02.149
Can I sit here?

28:06.320 --> 28:07.755
Yeah, obviously.

28:10.457 --> 28:12.159
So, do you,
do you come here often?

28:12.193 --> 28:14.195
Oh, no,
I come here to escape my place

28:14.228 --> 28:17.431
when I'm, you know, working
there all day and, you know,

28:17.464 --> 28:20.000
uh, you know, just to get away.

28:20.034 --> 28:21.969
You are just escaping
someone at home?

28:22.002 --> 28:26.941
No. No, no, I'm alone.
I'm, I'm separated.

28:26.974 --> 28:30.211
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:30.244 --> 28:33.080
I was married for a few years,
short time.

28:33.113 --> 28:35.482
And I have a daughter.

28:35.517 --> 28:38.452
She's great, she's great,
but it's hard, you know.

28:38.485 --> 28:41.822
And, well, you don't want
to hear this, you know, so.

28:41.855 --> 28:42.856
Yeah.

28:45.893 --> 28:48.395
So, you were
traveling for a while.

28:48.429 --> 28:52.333
Yeah, I was teaching in
India actually and traveling,

28:52.366 --> 28:58.138
trying to find myself
or... more of myself.

28:58.172 --> 29:02.977
- And you did, did you?
- I, I, to be honest,

29:03.010 --> 29:05.212
I don't know, like,
after being away

29:05.246 --> 29:08.550
I feel like I know less
actually than before.

29:08.583 --> 29:13.887
Then I just, I got tired and
my Mom was... not doing so well,

29:13.921 --> 29:15.990
so it was time to come home.

29:17.191 --> 29:20.294
You know what?
I wasn't going to say anything,

29:20.327 --> 29:22.363
but I was, I was going
to call you the other day

29:22.396 --> 29:25.899
because I... I found this box,

29:25.933 --> 29:30.037
which is so weird,
in my backyard,

29:30.070 --> 29:32.406
and it's filled
with these paintings

29:32.439 --> 29:35.376
and these love
letters to my mother.

29:35.409 --> 29:37.878
- Wow, from your dad?
- No, no, no,

29:37.911 --> 29:39.847
that's the thing is that
it's not from my Dad.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.882
It's like,
I want to find this artist.

29:41.915 --> 29:43.317
- Really?
- So I want to find who it is.

29:43.350 --> 29:45.052
- Really, why?
- I think he made them for her,

29:45.085 --> 29:46.320
and then they are...

29:46.353 --> 29:48.389
Is, is there a signature
on the artwork?

29:48.422 --> 29:51.058
No, there's no name anywhere.

29:51.091 --> 29:53.994
Anyways I thought just
because you said like

29:54.028 --> 29:56.030
that you were in the art
world that maybe...

29:56.063 --> 29:57.565
Yeah, yeah, I could.

29:57.599 --> 30:00.502
I mean, I could show it
to some galleries that I know.

30:00.535 --> 30:02.504
- Really? Yes, that would be amazing.
- Yeah, yeah. All right,

30:02.537 --> 30:04.438
- why not, right?
- Yeah, why not?

30:04.471 --> 30:06.840
- Why not? Why not?
- Why not, right?

30:06.874 --> 30:10.411
Okay, fine, fine, okay.

30:10.444 --> 30:13.180
- Ah, ha, ha.
- Yeah.

30:13.213 --> 30:15.149
Robot.

30:15.182 --> 30:17.217
My spot.

30:17.251 --> 30:21.455
One, two, five, six, seven, 14.

30:21.488 --> 30:22.557
Wow.

30:26.493 --> 30:27.361
Mom.

30:30.665 --> 30:32.066
I was just thinking about...

30:33.267 --> 30:36.337
people in my life who are gone.

30:36.370 --> 30:42.943
And I... sometimes forget who's
still around and it's like...

30:44.078 --> 30:46.313
more and more people are
dying who never died before.

30:48.949 --> 30:52.920
Yeah, I know that sounds funny,
but it's true.

30:55.155 --> 30:56.123
You know, and I,

30:57.224 --> 30:59.360
sometimes I forget what
you're father looked like.

30:59.393 --> 31:03.063
Like I have to... picture
his face in my mind and...

31:05.633 --> 31:08.936
I try to remember
little things that he'd do

31:09.637 --> 31:11.673
like the way
he'd pat his hair down

31:11.706 --> 31:13.575
after he'd take his hat off,

31:14.609 --> 31:18.045
and the way he'd open
the mail from the side.

31:18.078 --> 31:19.581
You know, always at the side.

31:20.481 --> 31:23.917
And... the way he'd laugh.

31:23.951 --> 31:27.589
He didn't laugh a lot, but
when he did it was contagious.

31:29.957 --> 31:31.593
Yeah, and then other people.

31:34.995 --> 31:37.030
Like who, Mom?

31:38.065 --> 31:41.135
Oh, just... people.

31:41.168 --> 31:43.003
Oh, come on,
you can tell us about that.

31:43.036 --> 31:43.904
April.

31:49.544 --> 31:50.477
What's wrong with her?

31:50.512 --> 31:53.247
Oh, she's just mad she's losing.

31:58.620 --> 32:01.121
- Oh, ho, ho.
- Double word.

32:01.155 --> 32:03.290
Very good.
Better than the last one.

32:24.111 --> 32:24.978
Hi.

32:25.713 --> 32:27.381
Bye, Mom.

32:27.414 --> 32:29.717
Hi, honey, was your mom
waiting very long?

32:29.751 --> 32:33.353
Kind of. Mom says to have me
ready by five on Sunday.

32:33.387 --> 32:34.421
Okay, all right.

32:34.455 --> 32:35.623
You ready for
a weekend of painting?

32:35.657 --> 32:36.724
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay,

32:36.758 --> 32:37.692
come on, let's go.

32:43.430 --> 32:47.669
Your dolphin, he's jumped
right out of the ocean.

32:47.702 --> 32:49.571
- Yeah.
- Fabulous.

32:49.604 --> 32:51.405
That's a real fat black cat.

32:51.438 --> 32:52.507
Mm-hm.

32:54.141 --> 32:56.276
What do you want to do
this weekend sweetheart?

32:56.310 --> 32:57.745
Just this, this is fine.

32:57.779 --> 32:59.012
Really?

32:59.046 --> 33:00.682
And how was school?

33:00.715 --> 33:02.382
It was good.

33:03.618 --> 33:05.587
What'd you do?

33:05.620 --> 33:08.523
I scored the most goals
in our basketball game.

33:08.556 --> 33:09.456
You did?

33:09.490 --> 33:10.658
- Yeah.
- The most goals?

33:10.692 --> 33:12.359
- Mm-hm.
- I want to come see a game.

33:12.392 --> 33:13.494
When's your next game?

33:14.729 --> 33:17.197
It might be uncomfortable.

33:17.231 --> 33:18.298
Why?

33:18.332 --> 33:19.501
Mom goes to them.

33:22.436 --> 33:23.370
Okay.

33:26.708 --> 33:28.810
You know, sweetheart,
there will be a time when

33:28.843 --> 33:31.144
your Mom and I
will be talking again,

33:31.178 --> 33:36.083
and we'll be able to sit
together and watch a game.

33:36.116 --> 33:39.754
Like sitting right
beside each other?

33:39.787 --> 33:42.724
Yeah, yeah. I mean, we'll be
sitting beside each other,

33:42.757 --> 33:45.259
but we won't be together
if that's what you mean.

33:47.829 --> 33:49.096
Sometimes, uh...

33:50.865 --> 33:54.569
people just, uh, they just
can't get going, sweetheart.

33:54.602 --> 33:55.537
You know.

33:56.538 --> 33:59.172
And they, they just,
they stop getting along.

34:02.710 --> 34:05.245
I know this is hard and...

34:06.648 --> 34:11.653
I would, uh, say magic words to
you to make everything better.

34:11.686 --> 34:13.387
I would move the whole Earth.

34:19.493 --> 34:20.728
I love your dolphin.

34:21.629 --> 34:22.597
Thanks.

34:23.565 --> 34:24.666
It's a very good one.

35:00.935 --> 35:02.737
- Mom.
- Yeah.

35:02.770 --> 35:04.471
I've forgotten how to work it.

35:05.907 --> 35:07.107
Oh.

35:14.949 --> 35:16.718
I knew that.

35:16.751 --> 35:17.685
I know.

Bye.

37:35.422 --> 37:36.356
April.

38:20.935 --> 38:22.469
Do you like this work?

38:22.503 --> 38:23.838
It's from one of our members.

38:25.072 --> 38:28.109
It's a post-post-premillennial
anti-apocalyptic look

38:28.142 --> 38:32.513
at the conundrum of modern
portrait in today's society.

38:32.547 --> 38:34.849
Selfies have
overtaken the world.

38:34.882 --> 38:36.551
What he's trying
to say is that today's

38:36.584 --> 38:38.519
selfie-obsessed
culture is full of shit.

38:42.590 --> 38:43.658
Sorry about that.

38:45.660 --> 38:47.528
I spend too long
by myself in here.

38:48.629 --> 38:49.764
Anyway, how can I help you?

38:50.832 --> 38:55.036
Oh, uh, I was wondering
if you could identify...

38:56.671 --> 38:57.638
this artist.

38:59.439 --> 39:00.541
Is he local?

39:00.575 --> 39:03.110
I, yeah, I think he is.

39:03.144 --> 39:04.579
There's no signature.

39:04.612 --> 39:05.746
We've been up and down
in galleries

39:05.780 --> 39:07.648
on Queen Street.
Nobody can identify him.

39:08.783 --> 39:09.650
May I?

39:20.628 --> 39:23.698
This does remind me
of one artist.

39:23.731 --> 39:25.066
Really?

39:25.099 --> 39:26.534
Yeah, part of a group.

39:28.836 --> 39:30.938
- Do you know his name?
- No, no,

39:30.972 --> 39:34.075
you would have to give me
time to look around and ask.

39:34.108 --> 39:35.142
Leave me the work.

39:36.077 --> 39:37.444
The?

39:46.187 --> 39:47.154
Thank you.

39:48.055 --> 39:48.990
Thank you.

40:06.540 --> 40:07.975
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:08.009 --> 40:09.577
- Sorry, what's going on?
- Sara, you won't believe

40:09.610 --> 40:11.145
what happened,
I found that artist.

40:11.178 --> 40:13.047
I found,
I found a lead on the artist,

40:13.080 --> 40:14.682
and this guy's going
to help us find him.

40:14.715 --> 40:16.150
- He knows him.
- What?

40:16.183 --> 40:17.551
Or he knows of him.
He can help us.

40:17.585 --> 40:19.053
Yeah, with, with Mom,
with the box,

40:19.086 --> 40:20.554
- the box in the back...
- April, I told you not...

40:20.588 --> 40:21.656
...with all the paintings?

40:21.689 --> 40:22.823
I told you to leave it alone.

40:22.857 --> 40:24.692
I, I know, but did,
but did you think

40:24.725 --> 40:25.760
we'd actually find him?

40:25.793 --> 40:26.694
This is great.

40:26.727 --> 40:28.062
- This is not great.
- It's really great.

40:28.095 --> 40:29.630
It is, it's so good.

40:29.664 --> 40:31.098
This is a waste
of time and it's rude.

40:31.132 --> 40:32.633
- It's disrespectful.
- No, it's not.

40:32.667 --> 40:34.168
- It's something good for Mom.
- Yes, it is.

40:34.201 --> 40:35.937
Mom, doesn't want it?

40:35.970 --> 40:37.738
She buried the box for a reason.

40:37.772 --> 40:39.807
She doesn't want
to remember this person,

40:39.840 --> 40:41.108
this part of her life.

40:41.142 --> 40:42.043
It's done.

40:43.878 --> 40:46.080
I mean,
you always do stuff like this.

40:46.113 --> 40:47.782
You know,
you think that you're helping,

40:47.815 --> 40:49.116
and you just get in the way.

40:49.150 --> 40:50.918
You're meddling and you,

40:50.952 --> 40:52.253
you try to romanticize
this kind of

40:52.286 --> 40:55.923
ideal end scenario,
but it's not like that.

40:55.957 --> 40:58.592
You have to take
a look at other things

40:58.626 --> 41:00.661
that are happening
right now in your life, okay?

41:00.695 --> 41:03.064
Have, have you even
thought about Oscar at all?

41:03.097 --> 41:04.732
This has nothing
to do with Oscar.

41:04.765 --> 41:06.033
It has everything
to do with Oscar.

41:11.672 --> 41:13.040
Listen, do whatever you want,

41:13.074 --> 41:15.810
I just, I don't want
to be a part of it, okay?

41:17.144 --> 41:18.612
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.128
Erik.

42:08.162 --> 42:10.731
- Sara, hi.
- Just the man I came to see.

42:10.765 --> 42:12.099
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:12.133 --> 42:13.300
You mind sitting with me?

42:14.268 --> 42:16.003
Mi casa es su casa.

42:16.037 --> 42:17.171
That's right.

42:19.807 --> 42:22.043
So, what's the matter?

42:25.980 --> 42:28.149
It's just, uh, family, I guess.

42:29.250 --> 42:30.351
Family.

42:30.384 --> 42:32.253
My sister, you know,

42:32.286 --> 42:34.889
she came back
just two weeks ago,

42:34.922 --> 42:38.325
and she's already
driving me crazy.

42:38.359 --> 42:40.895
I mean, I haven't seen her
in like two years but,

42:40.928 --> 42:42.663
and I love her.

42:42.696 --> 42:44.031
You know,
just how can we be exactly

42:44.065 --> 42:45.633
the same yet so different?

42:47.268 --> 42:48.235
Anyway.

42:49.770 --> 42:51.172
How are you?

42:51.205 --> 42:52.807
Tell me about you, your life.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.108
- Me?
- Yeah, your life story.

42:54.141 --> 42:56.877
Like who is Erik?

42:56.911 --> 43:00.281
Uh, well, I'm just a man,
just a guy.

43:01.348 --> 43:04.618
I don't know, I drove a truck
for a while and I, uh...

43:05.886 --> 43:10.157
kept orchids and...
worked in a factory.

43:11.292 --> 43:13.360
I was a cowboy for a while?

43:13.394 --> 43:15.696
- Cowboy?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:15.729 --> 43:18.766
I rode horses and, um,
I broke horses too

43:18.799 --> 43:21.302
except they broke me back so.

43:23.771 --> 43:25.239
I kept moving around.

43:27.875 --> 43:29.877
But eventually
I had to come home.

43:31.779 --> 43:35.816
Came back to Toronto but
there wasn't really much for me.

43:35.850 --> 43:40.087
I've got jobs but...
they didn't last long.

43:40.121 --> 43:41.388
They always had the same thing.

43:41.422 --> 43:43.424
They said, "You don't fit in."

43:43.457 --> 43:49.363
And so, it killed me
but I had to go online one day

43:49.396 --> 43:51.398
and get welfare and it hurt.

43:55.870 --> 43:58.739
You have had joy too I hope.

43:58.772 --> 44:00.307
Yeah, I had a joy.

44:00.341 --> 44:02.376
Sometimes too much
for my own good.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.313
And love, don't get me started.

44:06.347 --> 44:07.781
Why, what about love?

44:10.084 --> 44:13.854
Well, I don't have the heart
for it anymore, literally.

44:14.955 --> 44:17.191
Love can be hard on your heart.

44:18.459 --> 44:21.028
You, a boyfriend?

44:22.730 --> 44:23.898
No.

44:25.499 --> 44:26.433
I don't know, I...

44:27.968 --> 44:30.337
I get myself into
these situations where...

44:32.239 --> 44:34.775
I guess I like distance.

44:37.011 --> 44:41.048
I mean, I...
I really want passion but...

44:41.081 --> 44:44.118
at this point
I guess I'd just rather

44:44.151 --> 44:45.953
talk about it than be in it.

44:47.254 --> 44:49.757
It's more fun
when you participate.

44:53.394 --> 44:56.130
You would have made a really
good father to a daughter.

44:57.164 --> 44:58.732
I think I would have.

45:02.336 --> 45:04.305
I really wanted you
to listen to this.

45:21.989 --> 45:23.257
It's Erik Satie.

45:43.410 --> 45:46.046
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, Damien.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.115
- Are you joining us this afternoon?
- Thanks.

45:48.148 --> 45:49.783
- Uh, this is Sara.
- Oh.

45:49.817 --> 45:51.785
- She's a friend of mine.
- Hi, Sara, nice to meet you.

45:51.819 --> 45:53.220
Nice to meet you.

45:53.254 --> 45:58.926
Um... I go to a, uh,
therapy group on Wednesdays.

45:58.959 --> 46:00.794
Damien runs it.

46:00.828 --> 46:03.130
He's my, uh, doctor.

46:03.163 --> 46:04.498
Yeah.

46:04.532 --> 46:08.102
Um... Sara likes benches too.

46:08.135 --> 46:09.537
Don't we all.

46:09.571 --> 46:12.039
Uh, you live local?

46:12.072 --> 46:14.908
Uh, yeah,
just a few blocks away.

46:14.942 --> 46:16.544
Just never really seen you
around, that's all.

46:16.578 --> 46:18.212
Yeah,
I guess I keep my head low.

46:18.245 --> 46:20.515
Of course.

46:24.251 --> 46:25.520
Coming?

46:25.553 --> 46:26.487
Yeah, uh.

46:28.188 --> 46:31.325
My mind just gets
too many things.

46:31.358 --> 46:33.595
And I don't have an off switch.

46:33.628 --> 46:35.362
Thanks very much for the music.

46:36.430 --> 46:37.331
It was lovely.

46:37.364 --> 46:38.799
Thank you, Erik.

46:39.534 --> 46:41.135
Enjoy your day.

46:41.168 --> 46:42.136
Nice meeting you.

46:42.169 --> 46:43.437
Nice to meet you too, pleasure.

46:43.470 --> 46:44.905
Okay.

46:46.173 --> 46:47.908
Erik?

46:47.941 --> 46:49.376
She likes to call me that.

46:49.410 --> 46:50.411
All right.

46:59.320 --> 47:00.254
Hey.

47:07.595 --> 47:09.897
You really think these biscotti
are good enough to sell?

47:09.930 --> 47:11.599
Yeah, Mom, absolutely.

47:11.633 --> 47:13.434
People love your baking.

47:13.467 --> 47:14.902
You really missed a lot.

47:14.935 --> 47:16.370
Fresh baking all the time.

47:16.403 --> 47:18.372
Fresh vegetables
from the garden.

47:18.405 --> 47:19.340
It's been great.

47:20.341 --> 47:22.042
Well, Mom, it's like
you have been practicing

47:22.076 --> 47:24.178
for this moment for 30 years,
right?

47:24.211 --> 47:25.879
Yeah, well,
there's no reason why

47:25.913 --> 47:28.215
I couldn't have a big,
baking empire.

47:28.248 --> 47:29.416
Who knows?

47:29.450 --> 47:31.051
The point is,
you have to think big.

47:37.525 --> 47:38.626
Yeah, you do.

47:41.061 --> 47:42.429
Shoot for the cannelloni.

47:43.397 --> 47:44.532
Swing the big biscotti.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.635
Broaden the tiramisu.

47:47.669 --> 47:49.370
Go panettone or go home.

47:51.706 --> 47:53.107
Yeah.

47:53.140 --> 47:54.108
Touch your nose.

47:57.545 --> 47:59.279
Let's have some wine
to celebrate.

47:59.313 --> 48:00.381
- Very good.
- Yeah, sure.

48:04.151 --> 48:05.152
Ooh.

48:05.185 --> 48:07.221
Alright,
what are we celebrating?

48:07.254 --> 48:12.192
Well, your music,
April's writing...

48:12.226 --> 48:14.596
...and the fact that I have
two of the most beautiful

48:14.629 --> 48:16.598
creative daughters in the world,

48:16.631 --> 48:19.199
who obviously take after me.

48:19.233 --> 48:20.502
Sara's not that talented.

48:20.535 --> 48:22.336
Neither is April.

48:22.369 --> 48:24.338
Okay, I have two
of the most interesting

48:24.371 --> 48:25.406
daughters in the world.

48:26.306 --> 48:27.941
How many more do you know?

48:27.975 --> 48:30.177
Mm, just you two
and that's enough.

48:31.245 --> 48:32.913
Cheers!

48:35.382 --> 48:36.618
Mm.

48:38.986 --> 48:41.188
I was just thinking about home.

48:41.221 --> 48:42.456
Home.

48:42.489 --> 48:44.491
Yeah, you know, childhood.

48:46.360 --> 48:51.498
Like you, April, I left home,
left my family behind.

48:51.533 --> 48:55.269
Met your father, who traveled

48:55.302 --> 48:57.572
with a Canadian touring company.

48:58.573 --> 48:59.574
Shakespeare.

48:59.607 --> 49:01.275
Yeah, we know this one.

49:02.409 --> 49:03.711
"Romeo, oh, Romeo.

49:05.279 --> 49:07.047
Where for art thou, Romeo?"

49:08.048 --> 49:09.717
I was an amazing Juliet.

49:09.751 --> 49:11.686
- Yeah.
- I was.

49:11.719 --> 49:15.456
If I hadn't have left I wouldn't
have met your father.

49:16.457 --> 49:19.326
Bad boy of Canadian literature.

49:19.359 --> 49:21.061
I mean,
I had met some bad boys before,

49:21.094 --> 49:23.698
but no Canadians.

49:23.731 --> 49:27.401
And certainly not... none
that could write like he could.

49:29.604 --> 49:31.438
I have regrets.

49:31.472 --> 49:34.676
Leaving my mother,
we were close.

49:36.043 --> 49:38.278
You know, I see myself in you,
April.

49:38.312 --> 49:39.313
The adventurer.

49:40.748 --> 49:43.685
It's like, and you, Sara,
I see the person

49:43.718 --> 49:49.591
I should have been, staying
and taking care of people.

49:52.694 --> 49:54.562
Why do you regret
leaving your mother?

49:56.463 --> 49:59.166
I don't regret leaving her...

50:01.101 --> 50:03.638
because I wouldn't
have had you two.

50:05.072 --> 50:07.040
Yeah, I mean, you two.

50:07.074 --> 50:09.142
I, I wouldn't trade
this life for anything.

50:11.278 --> 50:13.380
No matter
what's happening to me.

50:15.517 --> 50:16.416
Mom.

50:17.852 --> 50:19.554
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

50:20.454 --> 50:21.656
We're going to take care of you.

50:22.690 --> 50:23.758
Both of us.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.127
Sorry, sorry.

50:30.197 --> 50:32.767
You know what? We're going
to have the best biscotti

50:32.800 --> 50:34.234
at that farmer's market,

50:34.268 --> 50:35.703
and we're going
to make a lot of money

50:35.737 --> 50:39.707
and be able to live in Greece
or Italy and have men

50:39.741 --> 50:41.341
catering to us, hand and foot.

50:42.376 --> 50:43.711
Men.

50:43.745 --> 50:45.613
Well, I'm not that old.

50:45.647 --> 50:48.583
You'd be amazed how many men,
you know,

50:48.616 --> 50:50.250
still look at me.

50:50.284 --> 50:51.786
Oh, yeah?

50:51.819 --> 50:54.421
Do tell, come on.
Are you withholding from us?

50:55.355 --> 50:57.357
Maybe someday I'll tell you.

50:57.391 --> 50:59.092
Come on, you can tell us.

50:59.126 --> 51:00.795
- The biscotti are ready.
- No, they are not.

51:00.828 --> 51:02.229
- You're such a liar.
- Yes, they are.

51:02.262 --> 51:03.397
No, I heard the alarm.

51:03.430 --> 51:05.399
Oh, yeah, saved by the bell.

51:05.432 --> 51:07.167
I don't hear it.

52:32.654 --> 52:34.187
Hi.

52:34.221 --> 52:35.355
- Hi.
- April.

52:36.858 --> 52:38.258
I have good news for you.

52:38.291 --> 52:40.193
- Good news, good news?
- Yeah,

52:40.227 --> 52:42.797
I wish I had more good
news for people.

52:42.830 --> 52:44.565
Uh, can I tell you
something frankly?

52:45.767 --> 52:47.467
Sure.

52:47.502 --> 52:48.803
I'm quitting my job.

52:49.971 --> 52:51.304
I hate art.

52:52.540 --> 52:53.574
Oh.

52:54.909 --> 52:58.278
Uh... I'm so sorry to hear that.

52:59.647 --> 53:01.516
The... uh...

53:01.549 --> 53:05.419
Did you, did you, uh,
have information on that lead?

53:05.452 --> 53:07.922
- Mm, lead?
- You texted me about the artist.

53:08.956 --> 53:10.158
Oh, um.

53:10.925 --> 53:12.459
Roger Nichols.

53:12.492 --> 53:14.227
- Roger Nichols?
- Mm-hm.

53:14.261 --> 53:16.496
He lives in Parkdale,
ten blocks away from here.

53:16.531 --> 53:18.432
- Roger Nichols.
- I met some people

53:18.465 --> 53:21.736
who actually know him and, um,

53:21.769 --> 53:23.971
he used to be homeless,
but now he has an address.

53:24.005 --> 53:26.507
He lives in the Romero House.

53:26.541 --> 53:28.308
So, do you know the address?

53:28.341 --> 53:29.242
Yeah.

53:30.878 --> 53:32.312
Can I have the address?

53:32.345 --> 53:33.246
Oh, yes.

53:37.018 --> 53:38.418
He lives in Colon Street.

53:38.452 --> 53:39.854
Oh, wow.

53:40.788 --> 53:43.457
Wow, Roger Nichols.

53:43.490 --> 53:45.893
Wow, this is great.
This is really, really great.

53:45.927 --> 53:47.995
I can't believe you
found this, thank you.

53:48.029 --> 53:49.630
- You're welcome.
- Great.

53:51.032 --> 53:54.502
Can I, uh... can I have that?

53:54.535 --> 53:55.503
This?

53:55.536 --> 53:58.338
Yeah, it's mine.

53:58.371 --> 53:59.339
Yeah, okay.

54:00.041 --> 54:01.274
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

54:13.087 --> 54:14.055
- Hi.
- Hey.

54:15.690 --> 54:18.826
I thought I'd, uh,
I thought I'd find Erik here.

54:18.860 --> 54:21.763
Oh, uh, I haven't
actually seen him today.

54:21.796 --> 54:22.663
Oh.

54:23.998 --> 54:24.799
He, um.

54:26.067 --> 54:27.835
Sometimes I just don't think

54:27.869 --> 54:29.837
he gets out of his house.

54:29.871 --> 54:30.972
He's not doing so great.

54:32.106 --> 54:32.974
Right.

54:36.376 --> 54:37.879
Do you want to go
for a walk with me?

54:37.912 --> 54:40.648
Yeah, yeah, I'd love that.

54:40.681 --> 54:42.817
Um, I,
I was on my way home actually.

54:42.850 --> 54:44.519
Do you mind walking me there?

54:44.552 --> 54:46.053
- Sure, that'd be great.
- Okay, perfect.

54:48.488 --> 54:49.690
I love this time of day.

54:49.724 --> 54:51.324
Yeah, why?

54:52.359 --> 54:54.862
Well, some photographers
call it like the magic hour

54:54.896 --> 54:56.396
or the purple hour.

54:57.430 --> 54:58.431
It's, uh...

54:59.767 --> 55:01.636
sort of when the light
burns the brightest,

55:01.669 --> 55:06.607
and you get, uh...
just the last bit of rays,

55:06.641 --> 55:08.609
and then light burns brightest,

55:08.643 --> 55:11.012
and then... it's all gone.

55:11.045 --> 55:13.748
Hm, kind of like life.

55:13.781 --> 55:15.883
I guess.

55:15.917 --> 55:17.985
But serious.

55:18.019 --> 55:19.687
Yeah.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.756
You, uh,
you seem to take on a lot

55:21.789 --> 55:24.091
of serious in your line of work.

55:25.126 --> 55:26.928
Yeah, I do,

55:26.961 --> 55:29.396
but then I get
to enjoy things like this.

55:29.429 --> 55:30.898
Like this?

55:30.932 --> 55:33.400
The light, you know.

55:34.101 --> 55:39.006
Uh, just get to walk
quietly and look and wander.

55:40.575 --> 55:43.110
And think, just think, you know?

55:43.144 --> 55:44.411
Yeah.

55:45.412 --> 55:48.616
Thinking...
I love thinking.

55:48.649 --> 55:50.718
But I probably do too much of it

55:50.751 --> 55:52.153
- for my own good, you know.
- Hm.

55:52.186 --> 55:53.120
Not enough action.

55:55.422 --> 55:58.659
Yeah. Some days I barely
get a chance to think.

55:58.693 --> 56:01.095
Just try and keep ahead
of the rushes of people,

56:01.128 --> 56:04.866
and patients and dealing
with their problems, you know?

56:04.899 --> 56:07.802
- Mm-hm.
- You won't believe the stories in some people's lives.

56:07.835 --> 56:10.037
You know, just so hard.

56:12.573 --> 56:15.408
Most of the time I'm just putting
a band-aid on it, you know?

56:15.442 --> 56:17.979
Just...
putting a band-aid on hurt

56:18.012 --> 56:20.848
that people sometimes aren't
even aware of, you know?

56:23.684 --> 56:24.952
You take on a lot.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.488
I do, but it's my job.

56:28.522 --> 56:30.024
I'm no savior
or anything like that.

56:31.726 --> 56:32.693
I understand.

56:35.529 --> 56:36.631
Honestly...

56:39.033 --> 56:43.671
Sometimes I...
there's something in me...

56:43.704 --> 56:47.174
that... I need it, you know?

56:47.208 --> 56:50.077
I just don't want
to be thinking too much.

56:52.246 --> 56:53.648
By yourself?

56:53.681 --> 56:54.749
Yeah, maybe.

56:59.854 --> 57:01.789
This is me.

57:01.822 --> 57:02.723
Oh.

57:03.524 --> 57:07.528
Yeah,
thank you for walking me home.

57:07.561 --> 57:11.498
No problem. Um, thanks for
sharing the magic hour with me.

57:11.532 --> 57:12.867
Yeah, likewise.

57:14.869 --> 57:15.870
- Okay.
- All right.

57:15.903 --> 57:16.904
- See you later.
- Yeah.

57:16.938 --> 57:17.905
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:00.581 --> 58:02.116
Morning.

58:02.149 --> 58:03.784
- Morning.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

58:03.818 --> 58:04.885
Thank you, honey.

58:06.287 --> 58:08.289
You're dressed up early.

58:08.322 --> 58:10.658
So, what's on the cooking
agenda for today?

58:10.691 --> 58:13.527
It's your party,
we have to do something special.

58:13.561 --> 58:16.697
Well, I thought we could start
with antipasto.

58:16.731 --> 58:19.000
You know,
veggies from the garden.

58:19.033 --> 58:21.702
And then pasta
with your favorite sauce.

58:21.736 --> 58:23.537
- Nice.
- Hm, beautiful, Mom.

58:23.571 --> 58:25.072
- Food genius.
- I know.

58:26.741 --> 58:29.210
Well, um,
it sounds like you guys

58:29.243 --> 58:31.112
have everything under control.

58:31.145 --> 58:32.813
I'll just head out for a bit.

58:32.847 --> 58:34.782
Maybe get some
flowers or something?

58:34.815 --> 58:36.584
- Yeah.
- Okay.

58:36.617 --> 58:37.818
Bye.

59:14.989 --> 59:16.223
Hello, Mr. Nichols?

1:01:39.466 --> 1:01:41.302
We're out of olive oil.

1:01:41.335 --> 1:01:42.369
Oh, okay.

1:01:42.403 --> 1:01:44.271
I can go grab some.

1:01:44.305 --> 1:01:45.507
Yeah, pick some up. Good.

1:01:45.540 --> 1:01:46.874
Do you need anything else?

1:01:46.907 --> 1:01:48.809
Um, just.

1:01:48.842 --> 1:01:51.178
No, I... If I need
something I'll text you.

1:02:12.099 --> 1:02:13.067
Erik!

1:02:14.536 --> 1:02:17.539
My velvet gentleman,
shaking things up.

1:02:17.572 --> 1:02:20.207
Yeah, I thought I'd find
a new place to sit.

1:02:20.241 --> 1:02:22.910
You know, break an old habit.

1:02:22.943 --> 1:02:24.311
I hope you haven't
been out all day.

1:02:24.345 --> 1:02:25.813
It's freezing.

1:02:25.846 --> 1:02:27.381
Yeah, um.

1:02:27.414 --> 1:02:31.252
I'm going to meet Damien later
and then, um, just go home.

1:02:31.285 --> 1:02:32.953
Any other plans?

1:02:32.987 --> 1:02:34.788
No.

1:02:37.291 --> 1:02:39.527
Listen, it's, uh,
it's my Mom's birthday,

1:02:39.561 --> 1:02:41.161
and my sister and I had planned

1:02:41.195 --> 1:02:43.998
this whole dinner for her,
but she's...

1:02:44.031 --> 1:02:44.999
Anyway.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:48.570
I would love
to have you as our guest.

1:02:48.603 --> 1:02:51.472
- Me?
- Yeah, you, absolutely.

1:02:51.506 --> 1:02:52.806
We'd love to have you there.

1:02:56.578 --> 1:02:59.146
I actually don't have
anything to wear.

1:02:59.179 --> 1:03:01.181
What are you talking about?
You're perfect as is.

1:03:02.316 --> 1:03:03.284
Seriously.

1:03:05.319 --> 1:03:06.987
This is the address.

1:03:14.596 --> 1:03:15.863
Will you come?

1:03:18.299 --> 1:03:21.168
Okay. Yes, yes, I will,
I will come.

1:03:21.201 --> 1:03:22.169
Awesome.

1:03:23.137 --> 1:03:24.838
Uh, five o'clock?

1:03:24.872 --> 1:03:26.006
My Mom likes to eat early.

1:03:27.074 --> 1:03:28.108
- Five, okay.
- Yeah.

1:03:28.142 --> 1:03:29.977
I'll be there.

1:03:30.010 --> 1:03:31.045
See you soon.

1:03:31.078 --> 1:03:32.346
Oh, yeah, five.

1:03:32.379 --> 1:03:33.548
Yeah, five o'clock.

1:03:48.929 --> 1:03:50.598
- Hi, Mark, sorry, I had your address.
- Yeah.

1:03:50.632 --> 1:03:51.965
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

1:03:51.999 --> 1:03:52.933
I need to talk
to you for a second.

1:03:52.966 --> 1:03:54.268
Yeah, come on in.

1:03:54.301 --> 1:03:56.538
- Listen, Mark, I found him.
- Who?

1:03:56.571 --> 1:03:59.106
I found the guy,
the guy we were looking for.

1:03:59.139 --> 1:04:00.107
The artist.

1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:01.408
- Wait, really?
- Yeah,

1:04:01.442 --> 1:04:03.143
he lives just
over here in Parkdale.

1:04:03.177 --> 1:04:04.278
Roger Nichols.

1:04:04.311 --> 1:04:05.647
He's been here right in earshot

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:08.048
of my mother this whole time.

1:04:08.082 --> 1:04:11.919
And now I just don't know if...
if I'm doing the right thing.

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:16.490
I just wanted to find out more
about my Mom and who she was

1:04:16.524 --> 1:04:19.226
and maybe give her some answers,
and I wanted to know

1:04:19.259 --> 1:04:20.361
what to do about Oscar.

1:04:20.394 --> 1:04:22.963
And... God, I don't know,
I just...

1:04:24.965 --> 1:04:27.301
Some things
are best kept secret.

1:04:28.302 --> 1:04:29.671
Yeah.

1:04:29.704 --> 1:04:32.206
If I was her,
I think I'd want to know.

1:04:33.575 --> 1:04:36.276
Oh, you should see this room,
it was crazy.

1:04:36.310 --> 1:04:38.112
It was like this mad genius,

1:04:38.145 --> 1:04:41.181
and he had... pasted
these photos and writings

1:04:41.215 --> 1:04:44.084
all over the wall
and the ceiling and...

1:04:44.118 --> 1:04:45.419
I was just lost in it.

1:04:47.321 --> 1:04:50.324
And now I don't know what to do.

1:04:50.357 --> 1:04:51.291
Wow.

1:04:52.727 --> 1:04:55.095
April, maybe you're
romanticizing this a bit.

1:04:58.065 --> 1:04:58.966
Yeah.

1:05:00.167 --> 1:05:01.368
I'll shut up.
I think you should do

1:05:01.402 --> 1:05:03.470
whatever your heart
tells you to do.

1:05:06.741 --> 1:05:08.643
- Daddy?
- Phoebe, hey.

1:05:08.676 --> 1:05:10.010
This is my friend, April.

1:05:12.479 --> 1:05:14.248
Why don't we go
to the park with April?

1:05:14.281 --> 1:05:16.216
- No.
- Why?

1:05:16.250 --> 1:05:18.720
I don't really know her.
Kind of a stranger.

1:05:18.753 --> 1:05:20.454
Shit, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry,

1:05:20.487 --> 1:05:22.189
I have, I have to go, I'm sorry.

1:05:22.222 --> 1:05:23.957
- Why?
- I, I was supposed

1:05:23.991 --> 1:05:25.693
to be at home for dinner
and help them cook all day.

1:05:25.727 --> 1:05:26.960
It's my Mom's birthday.

1:05:26.994 --> 1:05:28.262
I'm sorry, I just have to go.

1:05:28.295 --> 1:05:29.963
- Okay.
- Hey, what, uh,

1:05:29.997 --> 1:05:31.533
what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

1:05:39.473 --> 1:05:40.708
Hi.

1:05:40.742 --> 1:05:43.711
Um, is this April's house?

1:05:43.745 --> 1:05:45.412
Uh, yeah.

1:05:45.446 --> 1:05:47.281
Yeah, it is, uh.

1:05:47.314 --> 1:05:50.752
Oh... um, I'm,
I'm Oscar, um.

1:05:50.785 --> 1:05:53.688
- Oscar, wow.
- This is April's house, yes?

1:05:53.721 --> 1:05:56.658
Uh, ye... yeah, yeah. But... um,

1:05:56.691 --> 1:05:59.026
she just, she just
stepped out for a minute.

1:05:59.059 --> 1:06:03.063
Um... may I come in?

1:06:03.096 --> 1:06:04.699
Yeah, yes, of course, please.

1:06:04.732 --> 1:06:06.534
- Uh, come in, yeah.
- Thank you.

1:06:09.671 --> 1:06:12.607
Uh, uh, Mom, this is, uh, Oscar.

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:15.108
Uh, Oscar, this is our mother,
Eve.

1:06:16.176 --> 1:06:17.311
So, you're real.

1:06:18.412 --> 1:06:22.382
Yes... eh, I'm Oscar.

1:06:22.416 --> 1:06:27.020
I come here
to marry your daughter.

1:06:27.054 --> 1:06:28.756
Oh, really?

1:06:30.525 --> 1:06:34.629
When I was away from her
I felt... I felt crazy

1:06:34.662 --> 1:06:38.533
because she's, she's my, my,
um...

1:06:39.433 --> 1:06:41.168
- ...soul twin.
- Soulmate.

1:06:41.201 --> 1:06:43.136
Ah, yes, yes.

1:06:43.170 --> 1:06:44.706
Soulmate.

1:06:47.241 --> 1:06:49.611
Do you know
when she will be back?

1:06:50.678 --> 1:06:54.749
Not really, uh,
sure where she's gone exactly.

1:06:57.284 --> 1:06:58.485
She won't be long.

1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:01.455
Oh, eh.

1:07:01.488 --> 1:07:07.094
When I was on the plane my,
my heart was beating very fast,

1:07:07.127 --> 1:07:11.799
but I, I, I know that when I ask
her she's going to say yes.

1:07:11.833 --> 1:07:14.536
Oh, so she hasn't...

1:07:14.569 --> 1:07:16.604
No, she hasn't given him
an answer yet.

1:07:16.638 --> 1:07:17.705
Oh, no, no, but I...

1:07:17.739 --> 1:07:19.172
You knew about this?

1:07:21.108 --> 1:07:23.043
I mean, yeah, I guess.

1:07:57.779 --> 1:07:59.814
- April, what the heck?
- Hi.

1:07:59.847 --> 1:08:01.148
I'm sorry, I...

1:08:01.883 --> 1:08:05.218
Mom, I brought some guests,
this is, uh,

1:08:05.252 --> 1:08:07.522
this is Mark and Phoebe.

1:08:07.555 --> 1:08:08.690
I hope it's okay.

1:08:08.723 --> 1:08:10.592
Is it an inconvenience?

1:08:10.625 --> 1:08:12.527
Uh, inconvenient?
No, no,

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:15.697
uh, nothing April does
is ever inconvenient.

1:08:15.730 --> 1:08:17.130
- Hello, Mark.
- Hi.

1:08:17.164 --> 1:08:18.766
Sorry, I didn't catch your name?

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:21.201
- I'm Phoebe.
- Oh.

1:08:21.234 --> 1:08:22.202
April?

1:08:24.839 --> 1:08:26.473
Oscar?

1:08:26.507 --> 1:08:28.509
What are you, what, oh?

1:08:28.543 --> 1:08:30.177
What are
you doing... Hi.

1:08:30.210 --> 1:08:31.713
- I missed you so much, mi amor.
- Hi.

1:08:33.213 --> 1:08:34.481
Why aren't you in Argentina?

1:08:37.384 --> 1:08:38.853
- Hi.
- I'm here to be

1:08:38.886 --> 1:08:40.487
- in Canada.
- Oh.

1:08:41.522 --> 1:08:42.422
Okay.

1:08:52.967 --> 1:08:55.536
So.

1:08:57.639 --> 1:09:01.308
You are friends with April?

1:09:02.409 --> 1:09:05.412
Uh, yeah, yes, we're...

1:09:05.445 --> 1:09:07.815
- Uh, friends.
- Yeah, we're friends, we're friends.

1:09:16.758 --> 1:09:17.659
April.

1:09:19.861 --> 1:09:20.862
I, um...

1:09:26.668 --> 1:09:30.470
I buy only a one-way
ticket here to Canada.

1:09:33.473 --> 1:09:34.842
And I do this because...

1:09:37.979 --> 1:09:39.514
I want to know if...

1:09:42.817 --> 1:09:45.620
I'll just go get that.

1:09:49.590 --> 1:09:51.893
- Erik, hi.
- Hi.

1:09:51.926 --> 1:09:53.828
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- No, thanks,

1:09:53.861 --> 1:09:56.263
it's perfect timing, yeah.

1:09:56.296 --> 1:09:57.364
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:09:57.397 --> 1:09:58.432
Uh, Erik said he was invited

1:09:58.465 --> 1:09:59.767
and he wanted me to come along.

1:09:59.801 --> 1:10:00.902
I hope that's okay.

1:10:00.935 --> 1:10:02.670
Yes, thank you for coming.

1:10:02.704 --> 1:10:05.573
You look amazing.

1:10:05.606 --> 1:10:07.008
My velvet gentleman.

1:10:07.041 --> 1:10:08.876
I hope it's appropriate.

1:10:08.910 --> 1:10:09.844
It's perfect.

1:10:11.445 --> 1:10:15.550
Mom, um, these are my friends,
Erik and Damien.

1:10:15.583 --> 1:10:18.351
I invited them to the party,
I hope that's okay.

1:10:18.385 --> 1:10:20.755
Well,
it's a regular house party.

1:10:23.490 --> 1:10:24.892
I missed you.

1:10:24.926 --> 1:10:26.561
I missed you too, Oscar.

1:10:29.864 --> 1:10:35.603
When, when I went back to
Argentina... I couldn't sleep.

1:10:37.805 --> 1:10:38.840
I couldn't eat.

1:10:41.676 --> 1:10:44.746
It was like a part of me
had been torn out.

1:10:47.081 --> 1:10:50.051
I know that it was bad
to come here and...

1:10:50.084 --> 1:10:51.351
- No, no, no.
- Are you mad?

1:10:51.384 --> 1:10:52.587
No, I'm not mad.

1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:53.721
I'm happy that you're here.

1:10:54.956 --> 1:10:58.291
- I'm crazy, I know.
- Yeah, you are crazy.

1:11:01.361 --> 1:11:02.029
I love you.

1:11:06.634 --> 1:11:10.805
April, please,
you have to tell me.

1:11:10.838 --> 1:11:12.607
No, let's just
talk about this later.

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:14.976
- But why?
- When it's not at a family dinner.

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:17.979
Why don't you go sit down
and enjoy yourself, okay?

1:11:28.656 --> 1:11:30.091
So, I'm glad you guys
could actually make it.

1:11:30.124 --> 1:11:33.393
Oh, April, this is Erik,
Erik Satie.

1:11:33.426 --> 1:11:35.797
Wow, hello,
Erik Satie in the flesh.

1:11:35.830 --> 1:11:38.766
Oh, according
to your imaginative sister.

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.737
Mm, very imaginative, it's
a gene that runs in the family.

1:11:42.770 --> 1:11:45.438
We're both cursed
and blessed with it.

1:11:53.446 --> 1:11:55.448
I think Erik was
just a little frightened

1:11:55.482 --> 1:11:57.685
- to come here by himself, so.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

1:11:57.718 --> 1:11:59.854
No, thank you for coming
with him, honestly,

1:11:59.887 --> 1:12:01.122
because I don't know
if he would have...

1:12:01.155 --> 1:12:02.924
- Oh, no problem.
- ...made, made it out otherwise.

1:12:02.957 --> 1:12:04.625
- No problem.
- You know?

1:12:04.659 --> 1:12:06.561
Um, I love your tie by the way,
I have to say.

1:12:06.594 --> 1:12:08.763
- Yeah, it's really.
- Oh, thanks. Yeah, thank you.

1:12:08.796 --> 1:12:11.364
- Yeah.
- Your leg warmers, killing it.

1:12:11.398 --> 1:12:13.868
- Oh, thank you, yeah.
- You look great.

1:12:13.901 --> 1:12:16.003
Uh, actually I wanted
to talk to you about the thing

1:12:16.037 --> 1:12:18.739
that we were talking
about the other day, okay?

1:12:18.773 --> 1:12:21.809
Um... and here's the thing that,
like,

1:12:21.843 --> 1:12:24.512
really genuinely scares me.

1:12:24.545 --> 1:12:27.615
Is it that I do the work
because the work is good

1:12:27.648 --> 1:12:30.518
or do I do the work
because it makes me feel good?

1:12:31.552 --> 1:12:35.056
Well, I mean,
what's wrong with having both?

1:12:35.089 --> 1:12:38.425
You know, I love to play music,
right? It bring me joy,

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:42.797
but I hope that, you know, it
brings joy to others as well.

1:12:42.830 --> 1:12:44.932
I feel like that's the best, right?
when you hit the sweet spot of,

1:12:44.966 --> 1:12:47.134
of bringing joy to everyone
from what you're doing.

1:12:48.202 --> 1:12:50.403
Jesus, I'm having
a mini-existential crisis

1:12:50.437 --> 1:12:51.772
over here, sorry.

1:12:51.806 --> 1:12:52.907
That's okay.

1:12:59.647 --> 1:13:01.182
Mom, come, sit, sit.

1:13:01.215 --> 1:13:02.750
Yeah, sit down.

1:13:02.783 --> 1:13:04.719
Okay, everybody,
we're ready for dinner.

1:13:04.752 --> 1:13:06.921
Uh, Erik,
why don't you sit beside my mom?

1:13:06.954 --> 1:13:08.656
Are you hungry, honey?

1:13:08.689 --> 1:13:10.091
Yes.

1:13:10.124 --> 1:13:11.424
All right, all right.

1:13:12.827 --> 1:13:15.096
Let's dig in, yeah.

1:13:15.129 --> 1:13:16.063
Uh...

1:13:17.265 --> 1:13:19.667
Mom, why don't you, uh, walk us
all through the menu here

1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:21.702
because you have been doing
all of the work, you know.

1:13:21.736 --> 1:13:23.537
Okay, well, we have antipasto

1:13:23.571 --> 1:13:26.607
with beans and peppers
from the garden.

1:13:26.641 --> 1:13:31.012
And, in fact, the pasta also
has tomatoes from the garden.

1:13:31.045 --> 1:13:33.047
All fresh. Um.

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:35.816
Perhaps the youngest
would like to say,

1:13:35.850 --> 1:13:36.918
or could say grace?

1:13:38.119 --> 1:13:39.987
Thank you, spirit,
for bringing me here

1:13:40.021 --> 1:13:42.455
to celebrate Eve's birthday.

1:13:42.489 --> 1:13:44.992
And thank you, spirit,
for bringing Oscar on a plane

1:13:45.026 --> 1:13:47.028
to play lava with me.

1:13:47.061 --> 1:13:49.664
And thank you, spirit,
for all of this delicious food

1:13:49.697 --> 1:13:50.598
right in front of me.

1:13:50.631 --> 1:13:51.966
Bravo.

1:13:51.999 --> 1:13:53.768
- Bravo.
- Well done.

1:13:53.801 --> 1:13:55.102
Okay.

1:13:55.136 --> 1:13:58.539
Okay, uh, buon appetito.

1:13:58.572 --> 1:13:59.472
Dig in.

1:14:02.109 --> 1:14:04.011
So, have you lived here long?

1:14:04.045 --> 1:14:07.882
Oh, yes, um, quite a long time,
yeah.

1:14:07.915 --> 1:14:11.953
I came to Canada when I was...
quite young.

1:14:12.853 --> 1:14:13.754
Eighteen?

1:14:16.257 --> 1:14:17.725
No, I mean in this home.

1:14:17.758 --> 1:14:20.828
Oh...
I thought you meant.

1:14:20.861 --> 1:14:22.697
Mm, um, pasta?

1:14:22.730 --> 1:14:24.031
Can I pass some pasta?

1:14:26.968 --> 1:14:28.002
This is very good.

1:14:29.136 --> 1:14:31.072
- Um, in this home?
- Mm-hm.

1:14:31.105 --> 1:14:32.840
Oh, gosh.

1:14:32.873 --> 1:14:36.944
Well, the girls grew up here, so
yeah, we've been here for years.

1:14:36.978 --> 1:14:37.878
Thank you.

1:14:38.879 --> 1:14:41.115
- I'll, I'll hold it.
- Oh, thank you so much.

1:14:41.148 --> 1:14:43.551
I have a friend actually
who has one of those...

1:14:43.584 --> 1:14:45.152
old wheat grinders.

1:14:46.087 --> 1:14:47.888
- Oh, like a...
- It actually grinds the grains.

1:14:47.922 --> 1:14:48.856
Like a stone.

1:14:48.889 --> 1:14:50.858
Yeah, kind of.

1:14:50.891 --> 1:14:51.892
I'd like to see that.

1:14:58.232 --> 1:15:00.301
So, Oscar,
what do you do?

1:15:00.334 --> 1:15:01.502
Eh.

1:15:03.004 --> 1:15:08.275
Well, I come here to be
with April.

1:15:08.309 --> 1:15:09.977
But what do you do?

1:15:10.011 --> 1:15:13.080
Eh, back in Argentina,
I...

1:15:14.849 --> 1:15:17.551
eh, I'm an artist there.

1:15:17.585 --> 1:15:18.252
Oh.

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.789
- I hope to start a better...
- Great.

1:15:21.822 --> 1:15:22.923
...career here.

1:15:22.957 --> 1:15:24.992
So, so, Damien,

1:15:25.026 --> 1:15:26.594
that is a British accent, right?

1:15:26.627 --> 1:15:27.862
- Yes.
- Yes, well, see,

1:15:27.895 --> 1:15:29.930
I often get mistaken
for British.

1:15:29.964 --> 1:15:31.866
It's funny, because
I get mistaken for Australian.

1:15:31.899 --> 1:15:34.635
- So there you go.
- That's crazy.

1:15:34.668 --> 1:15:36.704
I really do.
I once had an Australian man

1:15:36.737 --> 1:15:37.972
mistake me for being Australian,

1:15:38.005 --> 1:15:39.273
and I don't know
how that happens.

1:15:41.242 --> 1:15:42.843
Where are you
from in Italy?

1:15:42.877 --> 1:15:45.646
Well,
my father was from Calabria.

1:15:46.647 --> 1:15:48.949
But,
yeah, when I was little...

1:15:50.251 --> 1:15:53.354
April, if you want me to leave...

1:15:53.387 --> 1:15:55.990
Oscar, Oscar, please.

1:15:56.023 --> 1:15:57.591
- You know how much I had to give up...
- Oscar, stop,

1:15:57.625 --> 1:15:58.893
- ...to come.
- Please. We're at a family dinner.

1:15:58.926 --> 1:16:00.094
Just sit and enjoy your food.

1:16:00.127 --> 1:16:01.829
April, just tell me, yes or no?

1:16:01.862 --> 1:16:04.131
Oscar, can we talk
about this later, please?

1:16:04.165 --> 1:16:05.733
- Stop.
- I can't.

1:16:05.766 --> 1:16:07.301
Don't, no, are you leaving?
Don't,

1:16:07.334 --> 1:16:11.005
- Oscar, please, Oscar.
- Um, this is very good, yes.

1:16:15.142 --> 1:16:17.111
I'm, I'm tired, yes.

1:16:17.144 --> 1:16:18.045
Okay.

1:16:20.281 --> 1:16:21.182
Uh.

1:16:25.152 --> 1:16:28.022
Well, maybe we should
all go to the living room.

1:16:28.055 --> 1:16:30.091
- Yeah, okay.
- Let's do it.

1:16:34.128 --> 1:16:35.863
Hey, you good, yeah?

1:16:35.896 --> 1:16:39.100
So, there's a bit of a tradition
when we have guests

1:16:39.133 --> 1:16:42.336
of a poem or a song,
so I thought it was appropriate

1:16:42.369 --> 1:16:44.305
since we're on
the cusp of winter.

1:16:45.239 --> 1:16:47.274
We're saying goodbye to autumn.

1:16:47.308 --> 1:16:50.177
poem by John Keats, <i>To Autumn.</i>

1:16:56.117 --> 1:17:00.187
"Season of mists
and mellow fruitfulness.

1:17:01.388 --> 1:17:04.692
Close bosom friend
of the maturing sun.

1:17:08.929 --> 1:17:12.967
Conspiring with him
how to load and bless

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.171
with fruit the vines
that round the thatch-eves run.

1:17:18.973 --> 1:17:23.210
To bend with apples
the moss'd cottage trees

1:17:23.244 --> 1:17:27.248
and fill all fruit
with ripeness to the core.

1:17:28.716 --> 1:17:33.354
To swell the gourd
and plump the hazel shells

1:17:33.387 --> 1:17:35.022
with a sweet kernel.

1:17:36.056 --> 1:17:39.193
To set budding
more and still more.

1:17:40.227 --> 1:17:42.196
Later, flowers for the bees

1:17:43.764 --> 1:17:47.835
until they think warm days
will never cease

1:17:48.769 --> 1:17:53.307
for summer has o'er-brimm'd
their clammy cells."

1:18:03.918 --> 1:18:05.819
That was lovely you two.

1:18:05.853 --> 1:18:07.755
Yes, very lovely.

1:18:11.225 --> 1:18:12.960
I had no idea you played.

1:18:13.994 --> 1:18:15.796
You make a wonderful
accompanist.

1:18:17.298 --> 1:18:18.933
It's almost like you guys
have been playing

1:18:18.966 --> 1:18:20.100
together for years.

1:18:22.369 --> 1:18:25.172
Um, maybe we should take
our leave.

1:18:26.473 --> 1:18:28.342
- Why?
- Yeah, what, why?

1:18:28.375 --> 1:18:31.412
I haven't been in a
family home like this in years.

1:18:31.445 --> 1:18:35.082
And... you are all lovely
people, but I don't know you.

1:18:38.252 --> 1:18:39.521
You're strangers.

1:18:39.554 --> 1:18:41.956
It's strange to be
in a family home

1:18:42.957 --> 1:18:45.259
sitting at a dinner table.

1:18:47.161 --> 1:18:48.462
Erik.

1:18:48.495 --> 1:18:49.897
I'm sorry.

1:18:50.898 --> 1:18:53.334
It's kind of you to refer
to me as Erik Satie,

1:18:53.367 --> 1:18:56.270
but I'm not Erik, I'm not Satie.

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:01.442
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.

1:19:03.177 --> 1:19:04.778
I know who you are.

1:19:04.812 --> 1:19:06.080
Maybe we should go.

1:19:07.014 --> 1:19:08.249
No, look, I insist.

1:19:08.282 --> 1:19:11.986
It's my birthday,
and so I insist.

1:19:12.019 --> 1:19:14.121
Please, please, stay.

1:19:14.154 --> 1:19:16.857
Please, we,
we have to have birthday cake.

1:19:16.890 --> 1:19:18.158
Yes, at least for that.

1:19:18.192 --> 1:19:22.062
I don't mind, uh,
that you're not Erik Satie.

1:19:30.337 --> 1:19:32.273
All right, everyone ready?

1:19:32.306 --> 1:19:33.941
- April?
- Where's April?

1:19:33.974 --> 1:19:36.210
April, where are you? Okay.

1:19:36.243 --> 1:19:37.911
One, two, three.

1:19:37.945 --> 1:19:41.815
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:19:41.849 --> 1:19:45.486
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:50.124

1:19:50.157 --> 1:19:54.529

1:19:55.429 --> 1:19:56.964
Mom.

1:19:56.997 --> 1:19:58.999
Happy birthday!

1:19:59.033 --> 1:20:04.606
I love you so much and you have
just been so wonderful to us.

1:20:04.639 --> 1:20:07.474
You immersed us
with literature and music,

1:20:07.509 --> 1:20:10.612
poetry and everything,
and I want to tell you that

1:20:10.645 --> 1:20:12.980
it's okay, it's okay.

1:20:13.013 --> 1:20:14.014
We know.

1:20:17.151 --> 1:20:18.986
Happy birthday.

1:20:19.019 --> 1:20:19.987
Is this for me?

1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:21.355
Yeah.

1:20:21.388 --> 1:20:23.324
Open it.

1:20:23.357 --> 1:20:24.291
Okay.

1:20:29.363 --> 1:20:30.565
Did you make these?

1:20:30.598 --> 1:20:33.334
No, Mom, they are yours.

1:20:33.367 --> 1:20:34.636
They are yours.

1:20:34.669 --> 1:20:36.937
And his.

1:20:36.970 --> 1:20:37.905
Sorry?

1:20:37.938 --> 1:20:39.406
Roger Nichols.

1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:41.041
Roger Nichols.

1:20:41.942 --> 1:20:43.977
- I know.
- Who's Roger Nichols?

1:20:44.011 --> 1:20:46.046
- You, I know.
- Sorry?

1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:49.617
I know, and you guys should be
together, you should.

1:20:49.651 --> 1:20:50.951
I saw it all night.

1:20:50.984 --> 1:20:53.053
I, I, I have never...

1:20:53.087 --> 1:20:56.290
The first time I've seen
your mother is today.

1:20:56.323 --> 1:20:58.258
No, no, I've been to your room.

1:20:58.292 --> 1:21:00.327
I was in your room and I saw it.

1:21:00.361 --> 1:21:02.996
I saw all of them,
and it was wonderful.

1:21:03.030 --> 1:21:05.065
- You are...
- You're a genius, they were everywhere.

1:21:05.099 --> 1:21:06.333
- April.
- And I loved it.

1:21:06.367 --> 1:21:08.168
Don't you think
it's time to drop it?

1:21:08.202 --> 1:21:09.236
No.

1:21:09.269 --> 1:21:10.505
April, those...

1:21:10.538 --> 1:21:13.374
I draw, I, I,
I use pen and ink and I...

1:21:13.407 --> 1:21:14.975
No, I saw, I saw,

1:21:15.008 --> 1:21:17.478
I saw it, I saw it, I saw it,
I saw them!

1:21:17.512 --> 1:21:21.148
- He's not Roger Nichols.
- I have never met your mother before.

1:21:24.318 --> 1:21:25.386
I, it just...

1:21:28.489 --> 1:21:31.058
But I found these
in the garden, Mom.

1:21:33.293 --> 1:21:35.530
I never met him until tonight.

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:41.536
Then whose art is this?

1:21:43.070 --> 1:21:45.038
- This isn't my writing.
- We should go.

1:21:50.411 --> 1:21:51.445
Then...

1:21:55.048 --> 1:21:57.384
Then who are you?

1:21:58.452 --> 1:21:59.554
I'm just a man.

1:22:01.155 --> 1:22:04.024
I'm not Roger Nichols,
I'm not...

1:22:04.057 --> 1:22:05.560
I'm just a man.

1:22:05.593 --> 1:22:06.594
Mom?

1:22:08.228 --> 1:22:09.731
- April...
- But I thought.

1:22:09.764 --> 1:22:12.966
It's just a mistake, that's all.
It's just...

1:22:15.503 --> 1:22:16.538
I'm...

1:22:19.574 --> 1:22:22.476
I'm so sorry.

1:22:22.510 --> 1:22:24.978
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1:22:25.012 --> 1:22:26.648
It's okay.

1:22:29.049 --> 1:22:30.217
April?

1:23:17.064 --> 1:23:18.365
They are quite beautiful.

1:23:25.105 --> 1:23:27.107
Hey, you think maybe
we should be getting going?

1:23:28.242 --> 1:23:30.310
I'd like to stay if that's okay.

1:23:31.378 --> 1:23:32.412
He's in good hands.

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.382
You sure I can leave you alone?

1:23:35.415 --> 1:23:36.818
I'll be fine.

1:23:36.851 --> 1:23:37.752
All right then.

1:23:39.119 --> 1:23:40.755
Sara, uh,
really nice chatting to you.

1:23:40.788 --> 1:23:43.223
Thank you so much for coming,
really, really appreciate it.

1:23:43.257 --> 1:23:44.626
Yeah. Anytime.

1:23:44.659 --> 1:23:45.593
Get home safe.

1:24:41.883 --> 1:24:43.450
I'm really tired.

1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:46.854
I'm going to go to bed.

1:25:57.525 --> 1:25:58.826
- Hey.
- Hi, Dad.

1:25:58.860 --> 1:25:59.827
How you doing?

1:25:59.861 --> 1:26:02.229
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

1:26:02.262 --> 1:26:03.598
Hey, there's Josh.

1:26:03.631 --> 1:26:04.699
Josh, from your school?

1:26:04.732 --> 1:26:06.199
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:26:06.233 --> 1:26:09.469
- Well, he's my boyfriend.
- Your boyfriend?

1:26:09.504 --> 1:26:10.772
- Yes.
- Really?

1:26:11.873 --> 1:26:12.907
Josh!

1:26:16.678 --> 1:26:18.646
Dad, this is Josh.

1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:19.614
- Hey, Josh.
- Hello.

1:26:19.647 --> 1:26:21.381
- How are you?
- Good.

1:26:21.415 --> 1:26:23.551
- Good?
- I might marry him one day.

1:26:23.584 --> 1:26:25.385
- Really?
- You want to go back to the swings?

1:26:25.419 --> 1:26:26.420
Yeah.
