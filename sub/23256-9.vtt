WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.568
- Previously on Nashville...

00:03.612 --> 00:05.309
- His parenting has nothing
to do with--
- He has everything to do

00:05.353 --> 00:06.832
with that show, Daphne.
- He's sending me
to boarding school.

00:06.876 --> 00:09.574
- Let go of him, Brad! Stop it!

00:11.707 --> 00:15.276
- So when I call your name
please come join me here up
front. Daphne Conrad.

00:15.319 --> 00:19.149
- I went down there and saw a
completely different person.
Certainly wasn't Juliette.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.846
- I don't know what's wrong,
I can usually do more.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.283
How much does Will hate me?

00:22.326 --> 00:24.633
He doesn't hate you.
He's just sensitive right now.

00:24.676 --> 00:28.637
- Please welcome The
Last Highways.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.682
- Somebody, come on!
- Call 911!

00:33.685 --> 00:36.079
- We don't know.
Nobody's telling us anything.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.864
They're running a bunch of
tests trying to figure it out.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.522
- Another mention.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.263
The internet loves
a good heart attack.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.396
- Wow.
New record for crass.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.615
- Will would laugh.
He likes puns.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.878
- Thanks.
We'll keep you posted.

00:52.922 --> 00:53.966
Okay.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.186
Deacon sends his prayers.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.753
Says if there's
anything we need...

00:59.929 --> 01:04.455
- So, your friend has a
serious infection.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.632
But we've started him on
broad spectrum antibiotics
and he should improve quickly.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.634
The EMTs thought
it was a heart attack.

01:09.678 --> 01:10.853
- It looked like one.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.420
And it could have been
just as dangerous

01:12.463 --> 01:14.248
but it's likely an infection
of the heart's inner lining.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.597
Something we call
Endocarditis.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.383
Are any of you aware
he was using needles,

01:19.427 --> 01:21.211
injecting steroids?

01:21.255 --> 01:22.778
What? No.

01:22.821 --> 01:25.389
Um, once, yeah.

01:25.433 --> 01:29.567
A few months ago, he said it
was human growth hormone.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.006
- He should be,
but he needs rest.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.139
It might be good if you
guys go and do the same.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.620
You can come see him first
thing in the morning.

01:38.663 --> 01:39.621
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:39.664 --> 01:40.883
- Yep.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.933
- The last report I got,
he's doing much better.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.544
- Good.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.372
- Yeah, it is.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.938
- Thank you.
- Here.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.549
- Hey, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry,

01:54.592 --> 01:56.551
you know, about
what happened. I just...

01:56.594 --> 01:58.857
- I know, I know.

02:00.381 --> 02:03.079
It's fine.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.689
- Well, it's not fine.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.343
And I feel like you still
got something to say

02:06.387 --> 02:08.040
so I just wish you'd say it.

02:08.084 --> 02:12.088
- Look, Deacon, I... I get
why you did what you did.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.785
I really do.

02:13.829 --> 02:18.573
It's just...it's gonna
make things...

02:18.616 --> 02:19.835
a lot worse.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.402
- I know.
I'm sorry, okay?

02:21.445 --> 02:23.186
It was just
a split second thing.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.622
And I just reacted...

02:24.666 --> 02:26.320
- I get it, honestly.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.844
It's taken me years to learn
not to react to him.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.411
- You know how much
I care about Jake.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.760
- I know.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.414
- And I'm sure
on top of that,

02:33.457 --> 02:35.416
I was flashing back
to my own dad

02:35.459 --> 02:39.463
and to things
that he would do.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.943
- I get it.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.164
You don't think I wanna
punch him in the neck

02:44.207 --> 02:46.905
every time I see him?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.951
- I'll let you handle the heavy
hitting next time, okay?

02:48.994 --> 02:50.648
- Okay. Thanks.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.133
Hi.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.221
- Excuse me.
Are you Jessie Caine?

02:58.265 --> 02:59.701
- I am, yeah.

02:59.744 --> 03:00.876
- You've been served.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.530
Sorry.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.191
- He's suing me
for full custody.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.199
- Nothing.
I just...

03:19.242 --> 03:20.722
I need to make some phone
calls right now, okay?

03:20.765 --> 03:22.202
- Yeah. You make them.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.650
- Hey.
Hey, buddy.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.087
- You guys just
watching me sleep?

03:38.130 --> 03:40.742
- Yeah. You were snoring
pretty good there.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.573
- Oh, like a thousand bucks.

03:45.616 --> 03:48.793
Seriously, though, I'm gonna
take this IV home with me

03:48.837 --> 03:51.100
and use it for my hangovers.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.276
Really, Will?

03:53.320 --> 03:54.843
What were you thinking?

03:54.886 --> 03:57.628
- Guess I was just hankering
for some adult acne

03:57.672 --> 03:59.500
and mood swings, you know.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.023
- It's just so stupid.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.199
- Gunnar...

04:03.243 --> 04:05.375
He... He could have...

04:05.419 --> 04:08.683
- Gunnar's right.
It was stupid.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.641
But you already
knew that about me.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.863
Anyway, I'm sorry...

04:14.906 --> 04:19.128
for everything
I put you guys through.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.609
Especially the mood swings.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.178
- I should probably...

04:26.222 --> 04:27.876
- Oh, yeah, take it, yeah.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.226
I'm not gonna die.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.668
- April Levine from
the Global Examiner.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.801
I'm writing a feature
on Juliette Barnes'

04:39.844 --> 04:41.498
mysterious absence from
the public eye.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.500
- How did you get
this number?

04:43.544 --> 04:45.850
- I'm told she's joined a
cult and fled the country.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.548
Care to comment?

04:47.591 --> 04:50.290
- She's on a service trip.
She'll be back soon.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.640
- And what exactly was
the purpose of your flight

04:52.683 --> 04:54.424
to Bolivia the other week?

04:54.468 --> 04:56.470
It seems like a long way
to travel just to say hi.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.124
- My purpose was
private, okay?

04:59.168 --> 05:00.474
And if you have any
respect for that,

05:00.517 --> 05:01.997
you won't publish this crap.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.914
- I was taking requests
for a coffee run.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.176
Didn't mean to intrude.

05:07.219 --> 05:09.483
- It's okay.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.834
- Just tell the guys
I've got to run an errand.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.575
- Okay.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.188
- Oh! Get checked!
No, get checked!

05:19.231 --> 05:20.189
- Hi, guys!

05:20.232 --> 05:21.321
- Against the boards!

05:21.364 --> 05:22.539
- Hey, come here.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.106
- How about you
come over here?

05:24.149 --> 05:25.629
- Sudden death.
Kiss me, please?

05:25.673 --> 05:27.109
- Oh...

05:27.152 --> 05:28.893
- You come here.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.634
- Oh! Booyah!

05:30.678 --> 05:32.157
- You're kidding me.
- You're whipped, dude.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.420
Gotta pay attention.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.204
- Okay, yeah.
Well, wait till tonight.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.205
And we'll see who's laughing
tonight because...

05:37.424 --> 05:40.601
- Tonight is my birthday.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.646
- Nope, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.778
- No. It's next Tuesday.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.781
- Because I'm a loser
and I looked it up.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.436
- Okay, fine.
It's my birthday week.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.351
- Oh, okay. Gotcha.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.352
Birthday week.
- Yeah.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.310
- And it's gonna be lit!

05:54.354 --> 05:57.052
- All right.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.706
- Gracias.
- Why, thank you.

05:58.749 --> 05:59.968
- Thanks, man.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.885
Did you know that
it's bad luck

06:03.928 --> 06:05.626
in certain cultures
to refuse a toast?

06:05.669 --> 06:06.714
- Dude, dude, dude,
chill out.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.498
She doesn't drink.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.717
- I know, and I don't wanna
be a bad influence, so...

06:09.760 --> 06:11.371
- Sure.
- Maybe I want to.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.633
- Yeah, dude, maybe
she wants to.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.069
- Yeah, maybe she wants to.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.897
- Okay then.
To an awesome week!

06:15.940 --> 06:17.202
- All right! Cheers!
- Salud!

06:23.121 --> 06:25.297
- I really can't recommend
discharging you today.

06:25.341 --> 06:29.040
- Well, sorry, doc, but I
gotta get back to Nashville.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.564
- Then I'll arrange for
the home health nurse

06:30.607 --> 06:32.304
to show you how to
administer the antibiotics.

06:32.348 --> 06:33.567
And you have to
follow up immediately

06:33.610 --> 06:35.090
with a cardiologist
in Nashville.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.744
- Whoa, whoa!

06:36.787 --> 06:38.702
This whole thing's not in
my rearview mirror yet?

06:40.182 --> 06:41.836
- You ever torn a muscle
or broken a bone?

06:41.879 --> 06:43.359
- Yeah.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.274
- Well, the same basic
principles apply here,

06:45.317 --> 06:46.710
except we're talking about the
most vital organ in your body.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.059
Your ultrasound
revealed something

06:48.103 --> 06:49.844
ambiguous on
your mitral valve.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.498
We're hoping this will be
enough to heal it.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.065
But it's also possible it
will require surgery.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.590
- Surgery...

06:56.633 --> 06:57.808
- Possibly.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.030
- And, uh...

07:03.901 --> 07:07.165
In the meantime as
far as playing shows...

07:07.209 --> 07:08.471
- To be honest, you shouldn't
even be thinking

07:08.515 --> 07:10.299
about that right now.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.881
- ♪ Give me something
perfect ♪

07:26.924 --> 07:31.276

- Hey, you guys see
Bucky's email?

08:10.751 --> 08:12.448
- Well, we just been
offered a slot

08:12.492 --> 08:14.406
at Music City
Music Festival next week.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.278
- Wow.
- Yeah.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.888
It turns out Hillary Scott's
gotta have vocal chord surgery.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.586
So we're subbing
in for Lady A.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.544
In other words, we're like,
we're headlining.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.504
- That sucks for Hillary.
But that's great for us.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.246
- You'll be back in action
by then, right?

08:28.290 --> 08:31.815
- Yeah. I just gotta check in
with a specialist at Vanderbilt.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.600
But I feel ready
to play already.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.297
- Well, there's no reason
to rush it, man.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.821
- Says the guy who's trying
to steal my vocals.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.962
- Well, surprise, surprise.
Look who's back.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.094
- Brad, I'm really hoping
that we can talk

08:50.138 --> 08:51.574
reasonably about this.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.533
That sounds great.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.579
I'm just glad ol'
Deacon's not here.

08:56.623 --> 08:58.799
- Look, if there's something
about my relationship with him

08:58.842 --> 09:00.583
that upsets you, I would be more
than happy to talk about it.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.237
- Oh, darlin'.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.892
- I'm asking that you not
take that out on Jake...

09:04.935 --> 09:06.894
- Darlin', you are
reading this all wrong.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.896
I'm not upset in the least.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.465
I'm worried about
the safety of our son.

09:13.509 --> 09:14.945
- Brad, come on.

09:14.989 --> 09:17.034
You and I both know
that he's not...

09:17.078 --> 09:18.645
- Look, that the man's
got a record?

09:18.688 --> 09:21.952
All sorts of violent
and impulsive behavior?

09:21.996 --> 09:24.259
And that doesn't even include
yesterday's assault, of course.

09:24.302 --> 09:29.351
- Deacon is incredibly
sorry about what happened,

09:29.394 --> 09:32.528
and he would be willing
to apologize to you about it.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.097
- Hmm.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.014
I hear you, yeah,

09:40.057 --> 09:41.755
but I just
don't feel comfortable

09:41.798 --> 09:45.323
exposing our son in that kind
of dangerous environment.

09:45.367 --> 09:49.893
- Brad, I'm begging you.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.113
Please don't make us go
through this again over this.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.680
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

09:53.723 --> 09:56.030
Look, you're the one
that's making this

09:56.073 --> 10:00.643
all happen through your
poor romantic choices.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.732
I mean, I thought you'd learn
to pick 'em better by now.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.561
I mean, am I right?

10:09.260 --> 10:10.871
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay!

10:10.914 --> 10:12.655
- Didn't think
I'd get a welcome party.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.178
- Well, Gunnar was kind
enough to let me know

10:14.222 --> 10:15.658
when y'all were
getting back in.

10:15.702 --> 10:16.703
- You know,
I can carry my own bag.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.530
- Nope.
I did my research.

10:18.574 --> 10:19.531
You're not supposed to be
physically exerting yourself

10:19.575 --> 10:21.098
at all right now.

10:21.142 --> 10:24.493
To that end, I made you a
cozy little spot here

10:24.536 --> 10:26.626
so you didn't have to deal with
going up and down the stairs.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.455
- Oh, I was kind of looking
forward to my actual bed.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.196
- They say after a heart attack,
you really shouldn't...

10:32.240 --> 10:34.546
- It wasn't a heart attack.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.113
It was a heart incident.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.986
And I promise a few stairs
is not gonna kill me.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.336
Oh...
- Oh, God!

10:41.379 --> 10:42.424
Will

10:42.467 --> 10:43.468
- Gotcha!

10:47.864 --> 10:49.649
- Well, his sense of
humor is healthy.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.651
- Hmm.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.435
- Umm, okay.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.829
We're going to get hot
chicken at Hattie B's.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.308
- Oh, my God.
This is so stupid, dude.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.006
Just tell her, dude.
- Think bigger.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.834
- Okay.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.924
Umm, we're going to take a
rocket to Mars with Elon Musk.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.752
- Ha! I like it.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.405
We should do that next year.
It should be next year's...

11:07.449 --> 11:08.929
- Hey, Maddie!

11:08.972 --> 11:10.365
It has to do with jersey
that he never takes off...

11:10.408 --> 11:11.888
- Bro, be quiet!
I give the clues!

11:11.932 --> 11:13.629
- Hey, hey, hey!
One rule.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.717
No hitting the driver,
remember?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.066
- I give the clues!

11:16.110 --> 11:17.067
- Are we going to
a Predators game?

11:17.111 --> 11:18.721
- Close, but even better.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.158
So much better, actually.
You're gonna love it.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.074
- Dude, is this
the players' entrance?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.990
They just give you
the entire arena?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.470
- Yeah.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.819
I mean, I did
sell out back-to-back nights

11:29.863 --> 11:32.517
here last March.
- Wow.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.520
- No!

11:35.564 --> 11:36.913
- Come on!
That's amazing!

11:36.957 --> 11:38.219
- It's awesome.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.699
Yo, where are
the festivities?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.265
- Yo, attention
deficit disorder.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.268
I'm literally texting
the guy right now, okay?

11:44.312 --> 11:46.793
- Oh, that's what I like!

11:46.836 --> 11:48.403
- There they are.
- That's awesome!

11:48.446 --> 11:49.839
Come out on the ice,
let's crush it, bro!

11:49.883 --> 11:50.840
You're not coming out...

11:50.884 --> 11:53.713
Oh, God, you're so dead!

11:53.756 --> 11:55.845
- Maddie, Maddie, Maddie!

11:59.806 --> 12:01.982
- That's for getting me--

12:02.025 --> 12:03.113
Okay, okay!

12:03.157 --> 12:04.114
- Come on, bro,
you got this.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.986
- All right.

12:09.293 --> 12:10.947
- Bro...

12:10.991 --> 12:11.948
- Okay, wait,
guys, guys, guys.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.036
One at a time, okay?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.472
- All right.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.778
Let's go!

12:15.822 --> 12:16.779
- Wait, wait, wait!
Who's first?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.128
- Two, three!

12:18.172 --> 12:20.043
- Wait!
No, no, no!

12:20.087 --> 12:21.523
Okay!

12:23.046 --> 12:24.047
- Goal!

12:24.091 --> 12:25.701
- No, no!
Okay, stop!

12:25.745 --> 12:29.879
Time! Time! Time! Time!

12:29.923 --> 12:31.446
I said one at a time!

12:31.489 --> 12:32.752
I thought...

12:32.795 --> 12:34.318
That was all of you at a time.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.581
- Not even worth it.
- Oh, not worth it.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.543
- ♪ See, I can't get you
out of my mind ♪

12:44.720 --> 12:47.549
- Guys, I think this is him.
Are you rolling?

12:47.592 --> 12:48.768
- Watch your cable, come on.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.682
- Listen...

12:52.032 --> 12:53.337
- On a trip.
She'll be back soon.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.036
- Is it true that
you flew to Bolivia

12:56.079 --> 12:57.777
to try to convince her
to come home?

12:57.820 --> 12:59.213
- Look, guys, I know you're
just doing your jobs.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.605
But I'm not saying
anything more, okay?

13:00.649 --> 13:02.129
- Is there any truth
to the cult rumor?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.391
- Come on, Avery.
- Just one more question.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.175
- Look who's home!

13:05.219 --> 13:07.264
Come here, sweetie.
- Hey, baby girl.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.006
- Come here, come here.

13:10.050 --> 13:13.618
- She's been asking nonstop
about Daddy and...anyway.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.665
- Sorry you had her
for so long.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.581
- Please, it's
the least I can do.

13:19.624 --> 13:20.582
Call me if you need
anything, okay?

13:20.625 --> 13:22.366
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.412
Bye, Cadence.
I love you.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.761
- Come here.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.851
Oh, it's so good to see you!

13:31.245 --> 13:33.334
- It's just me
right now, sweetheart.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.249
Just me.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.644
- Oh, pancakes.

13:39.688 --> 13:40.820
- Mm-hmm.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.344
- Ugh, cold pancakes.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.606
- Yeah, if you'd been up
an hour ago,

13:44.649 --> 13:46.390
they would have
been life-changing.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.870
- Well, I was out kind of late
with Jonah for his birthday.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.394
- Believe me, I am well aware.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.441
- This might be hard
to comprehend.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.442
But when you're a parent,
it's hard to fall asleep

13:54.485 --> 13:55.443
till your kids are all home.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.140
- I'm 18, Dad. Please!

13:57.184 --> 13:58.533
- I know.
I'm well aware.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.405
I'm trying to...wait...
deal with it.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.934
- Are you playing any
of your own music?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.414
- Yeah. What kind
of question is that?

14:10.458 --> 14:11.502
- I was just wondering
if you've written

14:11.546 --> 14:13.200
a song in a while.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.462
- Okay, one, is that like
your new favorite question?

14:14.505 --> 14:16.594
And, two, yesterday.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.161
- You wrote a
song yesterday?

14:18.205 --> 14:19.946
- Yeah, really.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.600
- It was about how
you're a wet blanket.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.517
- Well, that's actually a
pretty rich area to mine.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.128
- Yeah.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.086
There's like enough material
for a whole album.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.220
Stop it!

14:33.263 --> 14:34.917
- Sarah said they
reached second base.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.397
But Micah said it was
more like getting caught

14:36.440 --> 14:38.181
between first and
second base.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.922
- Eww.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.577
- Hey.

14:44.448 --> 14:45.623
What's wrong with you?

14:45.667 --> 14:47.669
- Nothing.

14:47.712 --> 14:48.931
What's wrong with your face?

14:51.194 --> 14:53.414
- Okay, obviously, you're
having one of your spaz days.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.938
So I'm just gonna choose
to not be offended.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.810
But I am here if you
feel like talking.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.291
- Why don't you ask
your stepdad?

15:09.604 --> 15:13.477
- ♪ I know that I was given
everything I could take ♪

15:13.521 --> 15:17.960
♪ From the moment I was living,
I was dying to make ♪

15:18.004 --> 15:20.006
♪ Nothing out of something

15:20.049 --> 15:22.051

15:22.095 --> 15:25.750

15:27.622 --> 15:30.103
We play it at the festival?

15:30.146 --> 15:32.757
- Yeah, sure.
I don't know.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.369
I gotta get back to Cadence.
We can talk about it later.

15:35.412 --> 15:39.634
- Okay. Good seeing you.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.940
- Yeah.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.033
- Just feels weird
without Will.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.948
- Yeah.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.825
- Yeah, come in!

16:00.916 --> 16:02.309
Zach?

16:02.352 --> 16:04.224
- Hey.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.662
- Well, I wanted to head
straight to New York

16:07.705 --> 16:10.447
but I was at this fundraiser
in Napa when I heard.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.972
And they said they'd already
discharged you, so...

16:14.756 --> 16:17.454
- That's not really an answer.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.718
- I came because
I care, Will.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.330
And...

16:23.373 --> 16:26.115
Because, I don't know,
I...

16:26.159 --> 16:27.987
I feel responsible.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.814
- I'm not sure I follow.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.036
- When you came to me
and said you wanted

16:34.080 --> 16:35.559
to get back together, I...

16:35.603 --> 16:38.693
- Well, that was stupid.
I'm sorry I said it.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.478
And, look, to be honest,
I'd rather we not...

16:41.522 --> 16:43.785
- No, Will!
I was stupid, okay?

16:43.828 --> 16:45.482
I'm... I'm...

16:47.876 --> 16:50.705
I'm not used to rejection,
and I...

16:52.881 --> 16:54.665
I shut down.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.712
- What makes you think that
has anything to do with this?

16:57.755 --> 17:00.671
- I don't know.
I don't.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.674
You just seemed upset
and then with Mark...

17:04.719 --> 17:06.199
maybe I'm being egotistical.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.418
In which case,
I apologize again.

17:12.857 --> 17:14.511
- No.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.083
I watched your
show on YouTube.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.782
- Mm, big heart-bursting
moment.

17:24.826 --> 17:28.786
- No one can light up
a stage like you can.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.092
You're gonna be back out
there soon.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
I'm sure of it.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.099
- 'Cause you're not someone
who lets something stand

17:37.143 --> 17:38.448
in between you and your heart.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.367
All right, well,
I'll leave you alone

17:44.411 --> 17:46.413
and get outta your hair.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.589
- You mean to tell me you
flew all the way to Nashville

17:48.632 --> 17:50.286
for a five-minute
conversation?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.723
- Well, you know, I am still
an investor in Highway 65.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.551
So I have a lot of
other reasons to be

17:54.595 --> 17:56.292
in Nashville
besides you, but...

17:57.859 --> 18:00.209
I'll come back and check
on you before I leave.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.569
- You gonna sit down and
join us at some point?

18:12.613 --> 18:14.441
Or you just gonna hover
like a vulture?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.095
- Like a vulture.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.357
Jonah's got this birthday
thing tonight.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.836
- I thought that
was last night.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.838
- It's his birthday week.
- Oh, yeah.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.492
I'm gonna resist the urge
to comment on that.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.233
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.495
- Don't wait up.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.328
- You been quiet, missy.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.117
You okay?

18:41.816 --> 18:43.296
- Why does no one
tell me anything?

18:44.906 --> 18:46.560
- I was gonna tell you.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.344
- Well, instead, Jake told me.
- I'm sorry about that.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.738
- Why would you fight
with his dad?

18:50.781 --> 18:52.696
- I guess because, if there's
one thing I can't stand

18:52.740 --> 18:55.960
is when people are
cruel to children.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.008
- Jake said he might not
be allowed to see his mom.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.966
- And his dad's gonna
try to make that happen.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.447
Jessie and I are gonna try
to make sure it doesn't.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.970
We're already speaking
with a lawyer.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.888
- "Nashville's Next"
starts on Monday.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.021
- I'm aware.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.458
- Maybe I shouldn't do it.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.982
- Look, sweetie, all this
stuff that happened,

19:18.026 --> 19:20.115
it shouldn't have anything
to do with you, okay?

19:22.509 --> 19:25.947
You wanna do the show,
you should do the show.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.384
- I wanna do it.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.473
I got your back.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.303
- Okay.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.349
- You know, you don't
always have to hightail it

19:36.392 --> 19:39.439
right after we...
do our thing.

19:39.482 --> 19:43.965
We could just,
I don't know...

19:45.880 --> 19:49.188
- Cuddle or order in Chinese
or watch a movie.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.973
Or bear with me.
I know it sounds crazy.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.540
You could always
spend the night.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.455
- That does sound crazy.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.847
- Crazy enough,
it just might work.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.328
- Uh, maybe.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.851
Raincheck?

20:02.375 --> 20:03.767
- You got something
going on tonight?

20:03.811 --> 20:04.855
- Yeah.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.685
- Okay.

20:08.729 --> 20:12.515
We could make plans
for later in the week

20:12.559 --> 20:14.648
like dinner or something.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.650
Think you can handle that?

20:16.693 --> 20:18.304
- I think I could handle that.

20:18.347 --> 20:20.306
- Yes. Well, it is a date.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.743
Everything all right?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.701
- Yeah. Don't worry your
pretty little head.

20:27.574 --> 20:28.923
- I'll text you then!

20:33.536 --> 20:35.669
- "From that day forward,
Fernando always remembered

20:35.712 --> 20:37.758
"the importance of asking.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.629
He was never without
a playmate."

20:39.673 --> 20:41.152
Okay.

20:41.196 --> 20:44.634
- Again!

20:44.678 --> 20:47.289
- Baby, we already read
the book like three times.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.944
Can you just try
to close your eyes?

20:49.987 --> 20:51.511
Please?

20:57.995 --> 21:00.128
Hi. What are you doing here?

21:00.171 --> 21:01.347
- Checking on you.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.567
You gonna let me in?

21:08.876 --> 21:11.226
- You could have called,
you know?

21:11.270 --> 21:14.229
- Yeah. Well, you would have
told me not to come.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.537
- You're more of a martyr
than a whiner.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.758
I'm the same way, if it
makes you feel any better.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.238
- I don't know if I
have the energy

21:23.282 --> 21:24.979
to be a good host right now.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.763
- You don't have to be.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.853
Just pour me a whiskey
and I won't say a word.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.995
- I gotta take care of that.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.432
- Go for it.
I've got my company.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.755
- All right, to 22 years
on this planet!

22:01.798 --> 22:04.410
Hopefully, I make it 22 more.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.933
- All right!

22:07.413 --> 22:09.415
- I wanna dance!
Let's dance!

22:09.458 --> 22:11.373
- I want to sit, okay.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.940
- I'll be there in a minute.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.463
You should get this guy
to keep you company.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.464
- Yes, you should.
- No, no, no, no.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.900
- Yes.

22:16.944 --> 22:17.901
- He's got legendary
dance moves.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.294
- Yes, let's go.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.687
- Dude, Jonah's just
being a dick,

22:20.730 --> 22:22.950
- Too bad.
It'll be fun, come on!

22:24.430 --> 22:26.649

usually dance, so...

22:40.794 --> 22:42.230
- Okay.

I mean, I'm actually
pretty good at it.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.943
Guess you could say
Juliette made me a pro.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.687
- She disappeared once before.

24:31.731 --> 24:34.516
It's different
circumstances, but...

24:37.693 --> 24:40.740
- Well, not right away,
but, yeah.

24:42.219 --> 24:45.222
- She has a special
power over you.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.486
Admit it.
She does.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.054
What is it about her?

24:53.230 --> 24:55.755
- I don't know.
It's like...

24:57.800 --> 25:03.284
It's like she has this fire in
her that's kind of mesmerizing.

25:03.327 --> 25:06.548
Till it burns you repeatedly.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.117
It took longer
than it should have,

25:10.160 --> 25:12.423
but I've learned my lesson.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.296
There's no third act
in this story.

25:16.950 --> 25:17.907
What?

25:17.951 --> 25:20.910
- Man plans and God laughs.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.522
- Oh, I'm serious.

25:23.565 --> 25:27.134
I mean, there's
no other option for me.

25:27.177 --> 25:31.268
I'm jumping off the roller
coaster once and for all.

25:32.705 --> 25:36.535
The only hard part
is it's just so...

25:36.578 --> 25:39.973
- Lonely, once you
take the plunge.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.674
- Look, I'm not
doubting myself.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.502
It's just the routine,
you know. The...

25:49.635 --> 25:50.897
- Yes! Yes.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.202
You know, like when
you go to bed,

25:52.246 --> 25:53.595
you have a ritual
with someone.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.119
Brushing your teeth,
talking about your day.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.948
- Warm breath on the back of
your neck as you fall asleep.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.559
- Yeah.

26:00.602 --> 26:03.344
Now each night I put Cadence
down, I stare at the TV.

26:03.387 --> 26:04.998
I don't even really
know what I'm watching.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.436
And just imagine
these long nights

26:08.479 --> 26:10.830
stretched out in front
of me, a desert.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.661
Sorry.
This is stupid.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.836
- It's not.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.925
- Okay.
Weak, at least.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.231
Not being able to be alone.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.365
- Well, I think the whole

26:24.408 --> 26:26.019
"learn to be
with yourself" thing

26:26.062 --> 26:28.238
is highly overrated.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.850
In my experience,
the only way that

26:30.893 --> 26:34.941
you truly get over someone
is with someone else.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.336
- No.

26:39.380 --> 26:43.036
Gunnar's just...nice.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.825
All right, that's enough.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.435
Get up.
We're gonna dance it out.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.526
Come on.
Out with it.

27:38.569 --> 27:41.224
- I guess you confused me.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.096
- Huh.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.924
- I mean, you're hard to read.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.926
Not like anyone I'd ever met.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.929
- Well, I could say something
similar about you.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.105
How?

27:54.281 --> 27:56.805
- You don't look at me
like other guys.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.677
- How do other guys
look at you?

28:00.591 --> 28:02.028
- Like something
they wanna own.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.863
- I should, um...

28:10.906 --> 28:13.082
I should get some sleep.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.868
Not that I'll be
able to, but...

28:15.911 --> 28:18.305
- Why don't you just
close your eyes?

28:22.570 --> 28:23.876
- Be here.

28:37.193 --> 28:38.673
- Hey.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.283
- Uh, hey.

28:40.327 --> 28:43.330
- You didn't have
to sleep on the floor.

28:43.373 --> 28:45.593
- I didn't mean
to sleep here at all.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.464
- Yeah.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.466
Uh, do you want coffee or...

28:49.510 --> 28:52.295
- I should probably
just get going.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.429
- Yeah, okay.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.126
- I envy you.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.609
- You got great bed head.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.222
- Hey, um...

29:08.094 --> 29:10.836
Thanks.
Thanks for coming over.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.315
- Of course.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.542
- Come on, girls!
Before it gets cold!

29:21.585 --> 29:23.979
Let's get this train rolling!

29:24.023 --> 29:25.720
There's one.
Where's your sister?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.330
- She said she's coming.

29:27.374 --> 29:28.897
- Well, good, 'cause
I don't wanna get there

29:28.941 --> 29:30.769
and find that Radnor Lake
parking lot all full.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.684
- Oh, come on now.
You love hiking.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.991
Hey!
Hot this time, bacon.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.123
We're good.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.820
Oh, listen.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.126
Make sure you got good shoes.
You got hiking boots?

29:40.169 --> 29:42.171
- We're hiking.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.651
All right? We're gonna
be up on the trails.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.348
We're not gonna stay down
by the lake.

29:45.392 --> 29:46.349
We're gonna walk up on
the trails and everything.

29:46.393 --> 29:47.437
- Okay.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.833
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.443
My stomach just
doesn't feel good.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.837
It must have been like
something I ate.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.317
I don't know.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.149
- Can I talk to you
a second, please?

30:04.672 --> 30:05.891
Why?

30:05.934 --> 30:08.415
- Upstairs, right now.

30:12.898 --> 30:13.855
You don't think I know
what a hangover

30:13.899 --> 30:15.335
looks like, young lady, huh?

30:15.378 --> 30:16.858
Maddie, what the hell
is the matter with you?

30:16.902 --> 30:18.512
- I was just having fun
with my friends!

30:18.555 --> 30:20.296
That's it!
- You need to find a new way!

30:20.340 --> 30:21.776
Or maybe you need to find
some new damn friends!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.517
How about that?

30:23.560 --> 30:24.866
- It's dangerous, baby!
It's irresponsible!

30:24.910 --> 30:26.302
You're not old enough
to be drinking!

30:26.346 --> 30:27.956
- I'm 18!
- The drinking age is 21!

30:28.000 --> 30:29.305
- I am an adult!

30:29.349 --> 30:30.524
- Not in this house,
you're not!

30:30.567 --> 30:31.873
- Then maybe
I should move out!

30:48.150 --> 30:51.719
- I'm sorry for
yelling, honey.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.068
I am. I just...

30:57.638 --> 31:01.207
Baby, if you're
anything like me...

31:02.773 --> 31:05.864
I don't gotta tell you
what it did to my life.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.739
Years I lost with your mom.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.659
Years I lost with you.

31:21.618 --> 31:24.099
If there's even a
fraction of a chance

31:24.143 --> 31:25.884
that you're like me,
baby, I just...

31:28.669 --> 31:31.541
- I'll be careful.

31:31.585 --> 31:34.414
- Yes.

31:34.457 --> 31:35.806
- Great.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.073
What?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.425
- I've just been thinking...

31:47.731 --> 31:50.038
maybe it's time
that I get my own place.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.345
I'm sorry...

31:52.388 --> 31:54.564
- No, it's not
'cause of all this.

31:54.608 --> 31:58.438
It's something I've been
thinking about for a while now.

32:01.963 --> 32:05.401
Think about it just
a little bit more.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.099
You need to get away
a little bit,

32:07.142 --> 32:09.188
go over to Scarlett's.
Hang out there for a while.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.146
All right.
Thank you.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.201
- Knock-knock.
Hey, partner.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.376
- Hey.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.336
All heart-healthy options,
I guess?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.599
- Yeah.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.645
Just came over to see
how you're doing.

32:31.688 --> 32:35.170
- Great.
Stronger every day.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.608
'Cause it kind of seemed
like maybe you're trying

32:38.652 --> 32:41.220
to put on a show for some of
us last time I saw you.

32:43.613 --> 32:47.356
- Well, what do you want me
to say, Scarlett?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.010
I feel weak, angry.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.578
My heart's messed up,
maybe for good.

32:51.621 --> 32:55.103
And I won't be performing,
not for a long time.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.020
- You're gonna get
that back there.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.587
I promise you.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.806
Just maybe now is the time
to focus on other things

33:02.850 --> 33:04.112
like writing maybe?

33:06.723 --> 33:08.638
- You're a writer,
Gunnar's a writer.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.031
- You're also a writer.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.772
- No. I sing and shake
my hips onstage.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.121
- You've written
plenty of songs.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.731
- It's not what I'm good at!

33:14.775 --> 33:16.298
I'm a showman.
That's my thing.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.039
And I can't do it anymore.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.041
- There are people out there
who are completely paralyzed

33:20.085 --> 33:22.043
and they learn to
communicate by blinking.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.914
And people who are deaf who
write symphonies and stuff...

33:23.958 --> 33:26.526
- Well, I'm sorry for just
taking a moment to feel upset.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.528
- No, it's okay to be upset.
It's good to be upset.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.312
It's better than the charade
you were putting on before.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.749
You gotta do something
with it, you know?

33:34.273 --> 33:35.535
- You have no idea
what it's like.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.189
- No, I don't.

33:37.232 --> 33:38.929
But I do now that you got
hands and you got a brain.

33:38.973 --> 33:41.106
So you should use them.
Here.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.587
I couldn't find my favorite
writing pens at the store

33:44.631 --> 33:46.633
so I ordered you some online.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.288
- Thank you.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.811
- You're welcome.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.642
- I barely touched
the guy, all right?

33:55.685 --> 33:57.296
I just took
his hands off Jake.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.602
I put him against the wall.
That was it.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.214
- And I can testify to that.
That's exactly what happened.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.172
- I'm sure it is,
but, of course,

34:04.216 --> 34:05.695
you're an interested party.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.610
- Well, yeah, but
so is he, right?

34:07.654 --> 34:11.440
- Right. I'm just saying there
are no impartial witnesses here.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.138
- I don't even know
what that means.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.965
I'm just saying that
I was just trying to stop him

34:15.009 --> 34:17.403
from hurting the boy.
That's all I was doing.

34:19.709 --> 34:23.757
- Has Mr. Maitland...

34:23.800 --> 34:26.107
ever been physically abusive?

34:26.151 --> 34:28.849
- Well, he's...

34:30.155 --> 34:32.722
Not physically, no.

34:34.115 --> 34:37.031
- Do you have reason
to believe he was going

34:37.075 --> 34:38.902
to hurt your son that day?

34:48.695 --> 34:52.002
Frankly, just looking
at this on paper

34:52.046 --> 34:54.135
doesn't seem promising.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.399
- In these kinds of situations,

34:57.443 --> 35:00.402
the court is going to draw
on whatever records it can

35:00.446 --> 35:01.969
in assessing
Mr. Maitland's claim

35:02.012 --> 35:04.406
that you are prone
to violent behavior.

35:04.450 --> 35:09.237
And just looking at these
court records for you, Deacon,

35:09.281 --> 35:10.760
past charges of
assault and battery,

35:10.804 --> 35:12.371
several drunk
and disorderly...

35:12.414 --> 35:14.677
- All of that, all of it
was a long time ago.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.070
All right?
That is behind me.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.117
- That may be,

35:19.160 --> 35:21.031
but at the end of the day,

35:21.075 --> 35:22.729
these records
paint a picture.

35:22.772 --> 35:25.558
And I'm afraid it's one
a judge may find

35:25.601 --> 35:28.038
more consistent with
Mr. Maitland's story

35:28.082 --> 35:29.605
than with yours.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.570
- You can't lose Jake.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.398
That's the main thing.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.269
The only way Brad can
take him from you

35:41.313 --> 35:43.793
is by linking
you and me, so...

35:46.622 --> 35:48.189
Just tell the court
that we're not

35:48.233 --> 35:49.582
seeing each other anymore.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.891
- And then we don't
see each other.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.680
And that's what you want?

36:00.723 --> 36:02.508
- No, I don't want it.

36:06.207 --> 36:08.078
It's the only way I can see
to put things right.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.776
So if it's what we got to do,
it's what we got to do.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.782
- This is nice,
going out like this.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.219
- Yeah.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.178
- I hear this Broccolini
is killer.

36:20.221 --> 36:23.790
- No, I hear the cauliflower
is worth dying for.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.706
- I'm making fun of
this restaurant.

36:28.838 --> 36:31.580
- Geez, another mention!

36:31.624 --> 36:33.669
This band is blowing up,
in case you hadn't noticed.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.802
- I kind of noticed.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.427
- I went over there
to check on him.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.083
- I crashed there
on the floor.

36:56.126 --> 36:58.303
- That's all you gotta
say about it, huh?

36:58.346 --> 36:59.956
- There's nothing else to say.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.567
- You know, fine.

37:01.610 --> 37:02.742
I'm just gonna go talk
to Avery about it.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.961
- Gunnar...

37:12.447 --> 37:13.405
- You knew how
much I liked her.

37:13.448 --> 37:14.536
But you did it anyway!

37:14.580 --> 37:15.711
Hey, hold on a second.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.322
What...

37:17.365 --> 37:19.062
So you don't know what
I'm talking about?

37:19.106 --> 37:20.455
- Yeah, I got a guess, but
nothing happened between us.

37:20.499 --> 37:21.935
We just fell asleep.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.763
- Oh, that's cute!
What

37:23.806 --> 37:25.547
- Gunnar, okay.
Take a breath.

37:25.591 --> 37:26.548
Let's just take
this someplace else.

37:26.592 --> 37:27.854
- No, no.

37:27.897 --> 37:29.899
I wanna have this out
right here!

37:29.943 --> 37:32.467
- I'm not gonna fight you if
that's what you're looking for.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.643
- Well, too bad,
because I'm coming for you!

37:34.687 --> 37:35.992
- Hey, hey, hey!
Dude, look!

37:36.036 --> 37:37.777
You gotta just chill...

37:37.820 --> 37:39.257
I'm sorry.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.215
- Damn it!

37:42.521 --> 37:44.131
- Yes! Yeah.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.877
- For the last time,
nothing happened.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.802
- You can't go.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.283
- Daph, it's just a couple
of days at Scarlett's.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.546
- And you're gonna
get your own place.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.199
- I don't know.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.158
I mean, I could change
my mind and decide not to.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.029
- Can you just wait
a little longer?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.948
- You just can't leave me
here alone! Please!

38:21.037 --> 38:22.430
- Daph, no matter what...

38:24.911 --> 38:26.173
I'm never leaving you.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.871
I'll see you all the time.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.614
- It's different.
It's not the same.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.137
- I know it's different.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.836
But it's gonna be different
in a good...

38:43.016 --> 38:45.801
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.808
- Something just
doesn't feel right.

38:52.852 --> 38:53.809
This isn't right.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.245
- Well, I agree.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.943
- I mean, before all
this stuff happened,

38:56.986 --> 38:58.553
we were good, right?

38:58.597 --> 39:00.294
Or am I just crazy?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.557
- You're not crazy.

39:02.601 --> 39:04.037
- What we have to do.
- Well, that can't be it!

39:04.080 --> 39:05.212
That just cannot be it!

39:05.255 --> 39:06.474
- Jessie, he's not gonna...

39:06.518 --> 39:08.607
- I am so angry that
this man keeps

39:08.650 --> 39:10.391
finding ways
to control my life!

39:10.435 --> 39:13.394
I hate that he has
this power over me!

39:15.178 --> 39:16.658
- Jessie...

39:16.702 --> 39:18.530
- And I just really
don't wanna lose you.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.185
- I don't want
to lose you either.

39:25.275 --> 39:28.061
- Well, let's just fight.

39:29.062 --> 39:30.193
- Okay.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.459
How?

39:34.502 --> 39:37.200

41:42.369 --> 41:43.979
What if I can't
leave you guys?

41:50.029 --> 41:51.421
- I knew you couldn't go.

41:51.465 --> 41:53.380
- Okay.

- No. Definitely not.

- Not that!

41:56.252 --> 41:59.517
