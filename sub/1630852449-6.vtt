WEBVTT

00:25.583 --> 00:26.416
I'm sorry.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.041
Vanessa inhaled too much smoke and fumes.

00:31.750 --> 00:32.916
She didn't make it.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.916
-I want to see her.
-I'm sorry. You can't.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.833
Don't bullshit me! I just talked to her.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.458
We had a little fight, that's it. Damn it!

00:44.041 --> 00:46.083
Let me through!

00:46.166 --> 00:47.208
No!

00:51.541 --> 00:53.250
Dominik. It's okay.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.041
I didn't want this.

01:05.916 --> 01:07.500
Hans, I didn't want this.

01:09.625 --> 01:10.666
You're in shock.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.458
I'll take you home, okay?

01:21.375 --> 01:22.458
She's okay.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.166
I thought I'd lost you too.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.916
What happened in there, Lisi?

02:09.333 --> 02:10.333
I killed her.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.000
What?

02:12.916 --> 02:14.458
Lisi, stop that nonsense.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.708
I posted the video.

02:18.916 --> 02:22.833
-This wouldn't have happened if I hadn't.
-Nobody wanted this to happen.

02:33.083 --> 02:34.416
What if we were wrong?

02:36.625 --> 02:37.625
What do you mean?

02:40.333 --> 02:41.708
She said she loved him.

02:43.541 --> 02:44.541
You believed her?

02:49.375 --> 02:52.208
Listen, if she'd really loved him,

02:52.291 --> 02:54.291
would she have lured him up the mountain?

02:55.083 --> 02:57.208
At night, tipsy, all snowy and icy?

02:57.291 --> 03:00.875
Would she have gone on vacation
instead of going to the funeral?

03:02.125 --> 03:04.125
Is that what you do when you're in love?

03:14.666 --> 03:15.708
Get some rest.

03:18.458 --> 03:19.458
Thanks.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.416
Call me if you need anything.

04:05.833 --> 04:06.750
Mr. Ziervogel!

04:07.541 --> 04:09.083
Good thing, I found you…

04:31.875 --> 04:33.416
THURSDAY, JANUARY 6
VANESSA

04:33.500 --> 04:35.583
SWIPE UP OR ENTER CODE

05:08.750 --> 05:09.583
What is it?

05:10.083 --> 05:12.625
Something stuck in your throat?
What's wrong with him?

05:12.708 --> 05:15.750
-I don't know.
-Hans! What is it?

05:15.833 --> 05:17.083
I'll call the doctor.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.541
Take deep breaths. Come on.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.375
Would you like some coffee?

05:37.875 --> 05:40.208
Thank you. I just want to talk to Lisi.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.708
Do they know how it happened yet?

05:42.791 --> 05:46.041
Right now, everything points
to a fatal chain of events.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.750
I'm afraid I can't say more.

05:48.958 --> 05:49.833
Lisi.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.250
I'm sorry to bother you this early.
But it's urgent.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.833
-Do you have a few minutes?
-Of course.

06:24.291 --> 06:27.250
Kosh! Why didn't you answer your phone?
I was worried.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.750
I fell off the wagon, okay? Sue me.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.375
That's totally normal.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.500
Anyone in your situation would have.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.000
I feel like I'm falling apart, Hans.

06:40.291 --> 06:43.458
I was this close
to calling Wirsing here from Munich.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.333
But you didn't.

06:45.916 --> 06:48.125
You know it'd have made things worse.

06:50.416 --> 06:51.958
Can you do me a favor?

06:52.041 --> 06:53.375
Of course, what is it?

06:57.750 --> 07:00.458
Can you please tell me
yesterday didn't happen?

07:01.875 --> 07:03.250
Unfortunately, I can't.

07:05.833 --> 07:08.250
We got into a fight, and now she's gone.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.416
I just can't believe it.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.166
Me neither.

07:15.416 --> 07:16.875
But we'll get through this.

07:17.958 --> 07:19.208
Together.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.916
Whether you want to or not.

07:24.916 --> 07:28.833
I'd like to kiss you right now,
but I'm scared I might faint.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.375
Look at you, Romeo.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.708
Because of your boozy breath.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.375
Right, I should brush my teeth.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.000
The arsonist is still at large.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.541
The family's already hired
a private investigator.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.083
Lisi, I need to know
what happened yesterday.

07:51.708 --> 07:52.541
Okay.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.416
A video of Vanessa went up
just before the fire.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.291
It caused a shitstorm

07:58.375 --> 08:00.916
and may have triggered
the arsonist's actions.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.875
You know anything about that?

08:09.458 --> 08:11.750
We recorded the video together.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.708
You and…

08:13.791 --> 08:14.750
Vanessa.

08:17.291 --> 08:22.250
She asked me to help her record
a casting video for some acting role.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.291
-So Vanessa was just acting in the video?
-Yes.

08:32.666 --> 08:34.666
That's not how she really was.

08:37.625 --> 08:40.708
Do you have any idea
how it ended up on the Internet?

08:44.041 --> 08:46.708
Is it possible
that someone leaked the video?

08:49.375 --> 08:50.916
Maybe to harm Vanessa?

08:51.666 --> 08:54.583
I don't know. We filmed it on her phone.

08:54.666 --> 08:57.500
I don't know
what she did with it after that.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.416
Sorry I can't be of more help.

09:05.916 --> 09:06.833
Thanks for now.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.750
Just one more question.
Any idea where Vanessa's phone could be?

09:21.833 --> 09:22.666
No.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.208
Why?

09:26.375 --> 09:29.625
We hope it might tell us
who was behind this.

09:30.375 --> 09:33.291
Neither we,
nor the private investigator found it.

09:38.000 --> 09:38.833
Okay, then.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.833
If you remember anything,
contact us, okay?

09:51.541 --> 09:55.208
VANESSA
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU DESTROYED EVERYTHING.

09:55.291 --> 10:00.125
HAVE FUN WITH LISI, THAT LITTLE RAT.
YOU TWO DESERVE EACH OTHER.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.541
I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.875
-Hello, Mr. Ziervogel.
-Roger.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.333
I know this probably
isn't the best time, but…

10:32.875 --> 10:36.083
we still have to talk
about the letter from yesterday.

10:37.750 --> 10:38.708
What's going on?

10:39.708 --> 10:42.541
I have to remind you
about the board meeting next week.

10:42.625 --> 10:46.208
As the sole heir of the hotel
and a new board member,

10:46.291 --> 10:47.958
you're expected to be there.

10:48.041 --> 10:50.541
Can't you do that for me? I can't make it.

10:51.541 --> 10:53.458
I'm only the hotel manager.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.708
Okay, then you're fired.

10:56.541 --> 10:57.416
What?

10:58.375 --> 11:00.458
And I'll rehire you as

11:00.541 --> 11:04.833
"Master Chief
General Advisory Board Fucker Deluxe."

11:06.666 --> 11:08.083
It's not that simple.

11:08.166 --> 11:12.083
Then come up with a better name.
Give yourself a nice raise,

11:13.041 --> 11:16.208
but please don't bother me
with this fucking holding company.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.416
All right, then.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.500
Anything else?

11:29.958 --> 11:31.083
Call me Kosh, okay?

11:51.000 --> 11:51.875
Hey.

11:52.875 --> 11:53.708
Hey.

11:55.916 --> 11:59.500
How are you holding up?
Do you want to talk about it?

12:00.958 --> 12:01.791
No.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.083
Should I leave?

12:07.708 --> 12:08.958
That would be best.

12:10.666 --> 12:11.500
Fine.

12:19.458 --> 12:20.958
What happened between us

12:21.750 --> 12:23.375
was a mistake, right?

12:26.125 --> 12:27.166
No.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.375
I don't know.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.708
Dominik!

12:48.625 --> 12:49.875
Isn't this Vanessa's?

12:51.625 --> 12:52.458
Yeah.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.791
She lost it when…

12:56.291 --> 12:57.375
You already know.

12:58.291 --> 13:00.291
I was just about to take it back

13:00.375 --> 13:01.500
to her family.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.875
Okay. I'll give it to them.

13:08.041 --> 13:11.000
I have to go see them at the hotel anyway.
Take care.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.958
Wait! Dominik!

13:16.208 --> 13:17.708
-Wait!
-What?

13:18.416 --> 13:20.416
Give it back. Please.

13:20.916 --> 13:23.041
Why? Is there
something they shouldn't see?

13:24.541 --> 13:27.958
I don't know what she wrote you,
but her last words for me…

13:33.458 --> 13:34.708
What are you doing?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.625
Deleting her last messages. Okay?

13:40.708 --> 13:43.250
Or they'll know we betrayed her.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.000
How do you know her code?

13:51.583 --> 13:55.666
It's her sister's birthday.
And we were together for four years.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.875
Okay. Now nothing
ever happened between us.

14:09.666 --> 14:10.625
You're relieved.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.208
No.

14:13.291 --> 14:14.958
I can see it in your face.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.333
Take care.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.000
Shit.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.875
Shit, shit!

14:27.875 --> 14:30.708
He's taking the phone
and recording right to her family?

14:31.333 --> 14:32.458
-Yes.
-Shit!

14:36.791 --> 14:39.083
Keep calm. We'll find a solution.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.166
We have to get the phone back somehow.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.250
But how?

14:46.208 --> 14:48.208
I can't just randomly show up there.

15:19.666 --> 15:20.541
Yes?

15:22.791 --> 15:24.125
I'm Lisi Madlmeyer.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.500
-I was there yesterday--
-You're Joseph's sister.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.500
Patrizia.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.166
Would you like to come in?

15:38.500 --> 15:39.333
Sure.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.875
…rely on the police investigation.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.041
That's what I pay you for.

15:47.791 --> 15:51.208
The search for the arsonist
has top priority, Mr. Kandler.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.208
Mom, Dad, this is Lisi.

15:54.541 --> 15:55.416
Lisi?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.375
Hello.

16:00.416 --> 16:03.041
I'm sorry for barging in like this, but I

16:04.500 --> 16:05.916
wanted to give my condolences.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.208
Elisabeth.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.791
Right. How nice of you to come.

16:11.875 --> 16:16.083
Dominik just told us
that you tried to save Vanessa.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.875
Can I offer you a drink?

16:19.458 --> 16:23.583
Thanks, that's not necessary.
I just wanted to drop off these flowers.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.083
Are you sure?

16:31.333 --> 16:33.666
Not even a little scotch?

16:34.208 --> 16:35.041
Claire.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.000
Why not?

16:45.125 --> 16:47.333
We've met before, haven't we?

16:49.333 --> 16:50.166
At Regine's.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.125
At brunch.

16:53.958 --> 16:54.791
Yes.

17:05.166 --> 17:10.250
It's hard to put into words
what happened yesterday.

17:12.666 --> 17:15.708
I thought Vanessa was
in good hands with Regine.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.583
I put my daughter in her care,
and what happened?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.500
Break-ins,

17:23.333 --> 17:24.875
videos, fire.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.291
-She was our daughter!
-Yes.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.833
We shouldn't have left her alone.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.416
We should've been there for her!

17:34.875 --> 17:36.875
I'll never forgive myself for that.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.500
-Claire.
-Don't "Claire" me!

17:39.583 --> 17:42.291
My daughter is dead!
I have to bury my child!

17:45.541 --> 17:47.291
I don't want to intrude.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.166
Could I use the bathroom?

17:52.750 --> 17:53.958
Yes, of course.

17:54.916 --> 17:57.083
Through this door, straight ahead.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.291
Okay.

18:00.833 --> 18:01.875
Thank you.

18:35.083 --> 18:42.083
VANESSA
CELLPHONE

18:51.125 --> 18:53.083
Looking for anything in particular?

18:55.708 --> 18:57.750
-Come with me.
-I…

19:02.000 --> 19:03.125
Where are we going?

19:03.208 --> 19:04.333
To my room.

19:04.833 --> 19:06.208
This isn't a good time.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.750
Fine, then we'll talk right here.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.375
-About what?
-What didn't you want?

19:16.125 --> 19:18.958
When we were watching the house burn,
you said,

19:19.041 --> 19:21.375
"I didn't want this."
What didn't you want?

19:21.458 --> 19:22.708
I can't remember.

19:22.791 --> 19:26.333
You can't remember
Vanessa and your brother's affair either?

19:26.416 --> 19:27.333
What affair?

19:27.916 --> 19:31.833
You become her best friend overnight,
force yourself into her life,

19:31.916 --> 19:33.541
and steal her boyfriend.

19:34.041 --> 19:35.166
Then a video comes out

19:35.250 --> 19:37.625
that causes a shitstorm
and her house to burn down.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.041
And now she's dead!

19:39.541 --> 19:42.000
Then you snoop
around her parents' hotel room

19:42.083 --> 19:44.500
and want me to believe it's unrelated?

19:48.333 --> 19:49.583
What didn't you want?

19:56.166 --> 19:57.208
I need your help.

20:01.125 --> 20:02.333
There you are.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.958
-Where are you going?
-Munich.

20:05.666 --> 20:08.458
Now? But Claire
and Ferdinand will be here soon.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.000
-I already saw them today.
-You didn't tell me.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.958
-Can you drive in your current state?
-I'll go crazy if I stay here any longer.

20:23.416 --> 20:25.875
<i>You believe</i>
<i>Vanessa drove Joseph to his death.</i>

20:26.583 --> 20:28.166
That's why you wanted revenge?

20:28.708 --> 20:30.500
But not like this.

20:32.708 --> 20:34.083
You have to believe me.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.625
What about Hans?

20:36.208 --> 20:37.250
Hans loves you.

20:38.166 --> 20:39.666
Why should I believe you?

20:41.375 --> 20:42.958
Because you know it yourself.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.291
But he's in just as deep as I am.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.458
If they find this recording,
everything will come out.

20:53.541 --> 20:54.916
They won't just get me.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.958
-They'll get Hans too.
-For what?

20:59.666 --> 21:01.250
Armed robbery.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.041
Hans was the robber?

21:08.375 --> 21:11.916
He stole that fucking watch?
How did it get into my bag?

21:12.958 --> 21:13.875
That was me.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.083
Just me.

21:17.250 --> 21:19.541
-What's wrong with you? You're…
-I…

21:22.458 --> 21:25.291
I didn't exactly handle
my grief very well.

21:26.125 --> 21:28.375
That's an understatement! You're sick!

21:28.458 --> 21:29.333
Maybe.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.375
And maybe I deserve this.

21:33.541 --> 21:34.541
But Hans doesn't.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.333
Maybe it's not too late.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.708
But I can't just go back in there.

21:45.625 --> 21:46.791
You have access.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.666
I don't.

21:50.291 --> 21:52.500
The phone is in the back bedroom.

21:54.416 --> 21:56.291
The code is 10-03-02.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.916
I'm only doing this for Hans.
And this stays between us.

THE RECORDING HAS BEEN DELETED…

23:23.125 --> 23:23.958
Hey.

23:25.333 --> 23:26.166
Hansi.

23:26.916 --> 23:27.750
Basto?

23:29.791 --> 23:32.875
-What are you doing here?
-I didn't know where to go.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.750
Everyone is looking for me.
I didn't want this!

23:36.833 --> 23:38.541
Please, you have to believe me.

23:40.875 --> 23:42.958
I didn't know it'd go up in flames.

23:51.833 --> 23:52.708
I believe you.

24:00.041 --> 24:02.208
You have to turn yourself in
to the police.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.416
I'll take you there, okay?

24:31.708 --> 24:33.041
-Lisi.
-Hello.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.083
Is Dominik here?

24:35.750 --> 24:38.583
He's on the way to Munich.
I couldn't stop him.

24:40.125 --> 24:40.958
I see.

24:43.250 --> 24:44.083
I'm sorry.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.583
Do you want to come in, talk for a bit?

24:50.333 --> 24:51.208
Thanks.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.750
I think I'd better go home.

25:04.541 --> 25:05.375
Hey.

25:06.208 --> 25:07.333
Are you alone?

25:07.416 --> 25:08.416
Yes, why?

25:09.791 --> 25:10.750
Can we talk?

25:13.083 --> 25:13.916
Of course.

25:23.916 --> 25:24.791
What's up?

25:27.041 --> 25:27.916
Kosh?

25:29.875 --> 25:30.916
Hans?

25:33.916 --> 25:35.291
I wasn't always honest.

25:37.958 --> 25:38.958
Do you love me?

25:40.000 --> 25:40.833
What?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.041
Just answer honestly.

25:47.791 --> 25:48.625
Yes.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.500
I love you, you idiot.

25:53.791 --> 25:55.458
That's all I need to know.

26:10.125 --> 26:11.166
I love you too,

26:12.375 --> 26:13.416
my farmer boy.

26:18.166 --> 26:19.000
Good.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.416
I agree.

26:36.708 --> 26:39.708
HI, DOMINIK.
I'M SORRY FOR BEING WEIRD EARLIER.

26:39.791 --> 26:42.541
SHOULD WE HAVE ANOTHER TALK?
I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY.

26:42.625 --> 26:43.458
DELIVERED

26:46.750 --> 26:48.000
Hey, Lisi.

26:48.958 --> 26:49.791
May I?

26:50.666 --> 26:51.625
Of course, Toni.

26:54.750 --> 26:58.208
I heard about what happened. I…

27:00.000 --> 27:03.208
can't quite believe it yet.
It's so shocking.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.041
How are you doing?

27:08.291 --> 27:10.541
Maybe that's not
what's important right now.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.375
You going back to London tomorrow?

27:18.833 --> 27:19.666
Yeah.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.208
Toni, I'm sorry I've been a bad friend.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.583
Come on, Lisi. It's okay.

27:29.333 --> 27:30.375
No, it isn't.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.208
I treated you like shit.

27:35.208 --> 27:37.583
I totally lost sight of our friendship.

27:39.708 --> 27:40.708
That's not fair.

27:43.375 --> 27:44.875
But it's understandable.

27:45.541 --> 27:48.250
You've been through so damn much.

27:50.833 --> 27:53.833
Don't worry.
It's nothing our friendship can't take.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.458
Toni!

27:57.750 --> 28:01.333
Excuse me. I have to say goodbye to Bine,
or she'll be mad.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.333
Go for it.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.833
<i>Hey, this is Dom. Leave a message.</i>

29:15.916 --> 29:17.250
Would you rather be alone?

29:27.166 --> 29:28.833
You didn't make it very far.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.458
I thought I had missed you.

29:36.916 --> 29:39.333
If only I'd been there a little earlier.

29:41.166 --> 29:42.166
What do you mean?

29:46.541 --> 29:48.125
There were four of them.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.208
What could I do?

29:56.375 --> 29:58.708
-I should've--
-Been able to prevent it?

30:01.125 --> 30:02.375
I was scared, okay?

30:04.125 --> 30:05.500
I was scared shitless.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.041
I blamed myself for so long

30:12.125 --> 30:14.791
for not stopping Joseph
from driving up there.

30:16.583 --> 30:17.833
It drove me crazy.

30:21.083 --> 30:23.208
You search for a reason for so long,

30:25.166 --> 30:26.916
all while life passes you by.

30:28.416 --> 30:32.541
Which is a shame
because life isn't so bad after all.

30:37.750 --> 30:38.958
If you let it be.

30:40.958 --> 30:43.083
What if you've destroyed everything?

30:47.666 --> 30:49.250
And it's beyond repair?

30:50.916 --> 30:51.958
No matter what…

30:54.125 --> 30:55.000
It's too late.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.791
Then maybe you'll find someone…

31:14.166 --> 31:16.000
to be broken with together.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.833
<i>And then comes the moment</i>

31:46.625 --> 31:48.291
<i>when the fog finally lifts.</i>

31:53.458 --> 31:54.708
<i>The path is clear.</i>

31:54.791 --> 31:58.083
DOMINIK
BUONGIORNO! BREAKFAST IS READY…

31:58.750 --> 32:00.125
<i>The view becomes clear.</i>

32:04.000 --> 32:05.708
<i>You quit looking back,</i>

32:07.166 --> 32:11.041
<i>ready to put everything</i>
<i>that happened behind you.</i>

32:39.541 --> 32:43.375
<i>If only it weren't</i>
<i>for the little voice telling you,</i>

32:47.833 --> 32:49.333
"Just don't look back."

33:23.250 --> 33:25.291
She was my best friend.

33:26.166 --> 33:28.416
-It's okay, baby.
-I can't believe it.

33:33.000 --> 33:33.833
It's horrible.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.000
Oh God, Nessa!

33:45.041 --> 33:45.875
Patrizia?

33:48.375 --> 33:49.208
Hey, Lisi.

33:50.291 --> 33:51.541
Do you need a moment?

33:53.375 --> 33:57.500
No, it's okay.
I just can't quite handle this event.

34:00.833 --> 34:02.833
How did you know about my brother?

34:07.916 --> 34:09.583
I just want to have closure.

34:22.666 --> 34:24.375
Kosh, you made it after all.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.083
Why wouldn't I?

34:28.666 --> 34:31.333
We weren't sure you could make it.

34:32.541 --> 34:34.250
People were trying to reach you.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.166
I was at Hans' place for a few days.

34:38.041 --> 34:38.875
A pleasure.

34:39.958 --> 34:40.958
My condolences.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.000
My condolences.

34:47.666 --> 34:48.583
My condolences.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.791
I think I'll pay my old man a visit.

34:55.416 --> 34:56.250
Should I come?

34:58.458 --> 35:00.291
I think I'd rather do it alone.

35:04.666 --> 35:05.500
Conny.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
Hey, Dominik.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.166
How are you?

35:10.250 --> 35:11.666
I thought it over.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.625
You know, your offer.

35:15.291 --> 35:17.541
I'm very grateful for the opportunity,

35:17.625 --> 35:20.916
but I don't want to take the spot
from someone more deserving.

35:21.750 --> 35:25.458
Don't be so modest.
I can see your potential in your sketches.

35:26.125 --> 35:30.250
You bring an unconventional perspective.
That's what we're looking for.

35:30.750 --> 35:33.500
Yeah, but I just feel
uncomfortable with it.

35:33.583 --> 35:36.666
And that's to your credit.
What will you do instead?

35:37.166 --> 35:39.000
I'll stay in Kitzbühel for now.

35:39.083 --> 35:41.708
And then, just put in some applications.

35:42.625 --> 35:43.625
Somewhere else.

35:44.333 --> 35:47.041
If it doesn't work out, I'll try again.

35:47.125 --> 35:50.833
If it still doesn't work out,
at least I'll know where I stand.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.375
And I just have to know.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.208
Hello, Dad.

36:06.250 --> 36:09.416
LUDWIG ZIERVOGEL
05/16/1964 - 08/22/2021

36:17.833 --> 36:18.750
By the way,

36:20.083 --> 36:21.458
I own your hotel now.

36:23.083 --> 36:23.916
Thanks.

36:30.750 --> 36:33.750
The thing is, I don't need a hotel.
I need a home.

36:36.291 --> 36:38.083
You never understood that, did you?

36:42.208 --> 36:44.583
But now I found someone who understands.

36:48.416 --> 36:50.916
Vanessa was always the star of the family.

36:51.458 --> 36:52.916
Nessa, Nessa, Nessa.

36:53.875 --> 36:55.375
I used to be so envious.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.833
Until I realized she had it much harder.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
What do you mean?

37:03.625 --> 37:07.208
Always posing,
always smiling, always being perfect.

37:09.375 --> 37:10.500
She wasn't free.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.250
But with your brother,

37:17.083 --> 37:18.625
she felt free.

37:21.375 --> 37:22.750
Do you think she loved him?

37:26.583 --> 37:30.250
-This really has to stay between us.
-I promise.

37:32.666 --> 37:36.500
Things weren't going well with Dominik.
She wanted to break up.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.833
She just didn't know how.

37:43.833 --> 37:47.916
Did Vanessa ever talk to you
about the night of my brother's accident?

37:49.000 --> 37:49.916
Well, she…

37:51.250 --> 37:53.833
she wondered
if he went up there to see her.

37:57.958 --> 37:58.833
Are you okay?

38:00.333 --> 38:01.875
Were you there that night?

38:02.666 --> 38:04.791
-At the party at your chalet?
-Yes.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.041
I know it was a year ago,

38:09.583 --> 38:11.291
but do you remember anything?

38:11.375 --> 38:14.541
Was Vanessa acting weird? Anything at all?

38:17.208 --> 38:20.625
At one point, she was looking
for her phone. Tons of drama.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
But she eventually found it again.

38:26.125 --> 38:27.208
Why?

38:27.291 --> 38:29.625
Why these strange questions? Lisi?

38:35.166 --> 38:36.000
Hans.

38:39.166 --> 38:42.041
-None of it makes sense anymore.
-What makes no sense?

38:42.125 --> 38:43.041
Vanessa.

38:44.208 --> 38:46.208
I just talked to her sister.

38:47.083 --> 38:49.166
-Something must've happened--
-Lisi.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.166
Stop torturing yourself.

38:53.416 --> 38:55.916
You read the messages. So did I.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.500
And we heard Jo's final voicemail.

38:59.041 --> 39:03.083
What if Vanessa didn't send
those messages to Joseph?

39:13.750 --> 39:14.625
Lisi.

39:15.458 --> 39:16.750
Where are you going?

39:41.291 --> 39:45.833
POLICE

39:50.000 --> 39:51.166
Mr. Ziervogel?

39:53.125 --> 39:55.458
You're under arrest
for destruction of evidence.

39:55.541 --> 39:56.541
Don't touch me.

39:58.291 --> 39:59.208
Stay back.

39:59.791 --> 40:00.708
What did he do?

40:14.166 --> 40:15.458
My brother Joseph

40:16.666 --> 40:18.083
died a year ago.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.083
Lisi!

40:21.375 --> 40:22.500
Where are you going?

40:22.583 --> 40:24.500
How do you know her code?

40:24.583 --> 40:26.208
It's her sister's birthday.

40:29.750 --> 40:30.833
What's wrong?

40:34.166 --> 40:36.333
What if you've destroyed everything?

43:41.041 --> 43:44.291
