FROM MOZE,

{\an1}MR. MONROE TAUGHT THE CLASS
A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON

11:40.032 --> 11:43.035
ON A BRAND-NEW LARRY:
THE HEIMLICH MANEUVER.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.370
IF SOMEONE IS CHOKING,

11:44.453 --> 11:47.415
PLACE THE THUMB SIDE
OF YOUR FIST BELOW THE RIBS.

11:47.498 --> 11:51.877

{\an1}IT HELPS US UNDERSTAND
HOW OUR BODIES ARE CHANGING,

A HUGE LIFESAVER.

HAVE TO DEAL WITH JEALOUSY.

{\an1}OR SEE SOMEONE TALKING TO
THE CRUSH OF YOUR LIFE,

12:37.548 --> 12:41.343
IT'S NORMAL TO FEEL JEALOUS.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.389

IS USUALLY A SIGN OF INSECURITY.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.391
