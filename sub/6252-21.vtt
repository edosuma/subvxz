Hey, you.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.155
Hey.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.816

Oh, God.

[ Brennan ]
How about an encyclopedia?
Ooh, or a microscope?

01:06.150 --> 01:08.687
Bones, Angela and Hodgins
are having a baby,
not a graduate student.

01:08.778 --> 01:12.737
I got it. Ha, ha!
Stuffed animal. That’s it.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.779
How will that
benefit the child?

01:14.909 --> 01:18.401
Bones, they’re having a kid
whose major pastime’s gonna be
about pooping his pants.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.032
Okay? Mr. Poo—poo Pants.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.580
Well, in one of my foster families,
I had a— a stuffed dog.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.325
And you liked it, right?
It frightened me actually.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.833
It was the family pet for many years
before they had it stuffed.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.959
Oh. We’ll forget about the whole
“stuffed animal” thing.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.716
I got it. We’ll get him one
of those mobiles for the crib.

01:37.807 --> 01:41.925
Oh, those are very good
for spatial recognition
and cognitive development.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.011
There. See, that
wasn’t so hard, was it?
Hmm? Piece of cake.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.222
Soon I’m going to be
the only one without a child.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.773
Oh, come on. Please, Bones.
I’ll tell you what.

01:49.860 --> 01:54.320
When you get a good look
at that pudgy little baby face,

01:54.407 --> 01:56.614
your hormones
are gonna go wacko.

01:56.701 --> 02:00.410
Right? And before you know it,
bang— Mama Bones.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.779
That’s not how it happens, Booth.
I think that’s how it works.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.125
Okay, okay.
Time to go to work.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.824
I need you back
at the lab right now.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.581
Why? Did someone remove
the remains from a crime scene again?

02:09.672 --> 02:12.880
Oh, that’s not good. You know
how cranky she gets about that.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.424
This particular body—
she’s still alive.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.627
Well, if she’s still alive,
then why do you need me?

02:17.722 --> 02:19.758
Because it looks like
she killed someone,

02:19.849 --> 02:21.430
and we need
your forensic voodoo...

02:21.517 --> 02:23.724
to tell us who she is
and who her victim might be.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.143
- Why don’t we just question her?
- I would love to, chér/I

02:26.230 --> 02:27.891
But she’s a deaf mute.

02:30.443 --> 02:33.310
“Deaf mute” is
a historically derogative term.

02:33.404 --> 02:37.488
I believe the correct terminology
is “deaf and uncommunicative.”

02:37.575 --> 02:41.033
Whatever the song title—
she can’t hear, and she ain’t talking.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.031
- [ Device Beeps ]
- [Woman ] This is outrageous, Miss Julian.

02:43.122 --> 02:45.738
You can’t keep this child here
without filing charges.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.869
Yes, I can.
I have a court order.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.201
- Is this the girl?
- Yes, and I’m Grace Meacham.

02:50.296 --> 02:52.207
I’ve been appointed
by Child Protective Services...

02:52.298 --> 02:54.710
to represent the child’s interests
until her family can be found.

02:54.800 --> 02:59.544
And you’ve made an assumption
of her status as a minor
based on... what?

02:59.638 --> 03:02.471
- Look at her.
- Are you a scientist or a doctor?

03:02.558 --> 03:04.514
No. I’m an attorney, but—

03:04.602 --> 03:06.843
Then let’s agree that I won’t
give you legal opinions...

03:06.937 --> 03:09.064
and you won’t pretend
to be a scientist.

03:09.148 --> 03:11.059
Was she covered in blood
when she was found?

03:11.150 --> 03:13.641
Yes. Someone else’s blood.
We’re trying to figure out whose.

03:13.736 --> 03:16.648
She also has particulates on her
that might tell us what happened.

03:16.739 --> 03:20.231
- And she was carrying this?
- [Caroline] Yep. She
was waving the knife around,

03:20.326 --> 03:22.317
threatening
the arresting officer.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.402
And we also found
that money on her.

03:24.497 --> 03:26.453
- Looks like a robbery that went bad.
- Can you sign?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.496
Because we’ll need
to communicate with her.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.166
Yes. But as of yet,
she hasn’t responded.
And who are you?

03:31.253 --> 03:34.666
Dr. Brennan is the best
forensic anthropologist
in the country.

03:34.757 --> 03:38.841
World. By examining
her skeletal structure
and other markers,

03:38.928 --> 03:43.513
I’ll be able to determine age
and other identifiers that
could explain what happened.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.635
I’m sorry. But any medical tests
without Jane Doe’s prior approval...

03:45.726 --> 03:48.468
would be a violation
of her constitutional rights.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.599
Read the order, che’r/e.
Exigent circumstances.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.976
The judge gave
the Jeffersonian permission...

03:54.068 --> 03:56.559
to do any tests
they deem necessary.

03:56.654 --> 03:59.987
Her clothes are soaked
with at least one full liter of blood.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.484
That’s a Class II hemorrhage.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.408
If her victim was of average size
and he survived the attack,

04:04.495 --> 04:06.486
he could be dying
of blood loss right now.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.196
Examining her could potentially
save the victim’s life.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.282
Unless you don’t feel
that’s important.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.083
I had no idea.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.502
Of course you didn’t.
You’re an attorney.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.454
[ Saroyan ]
Could you let her know...

04:17.550 --> 04:20.292
that I’m going to need
to take blood samples
from her hair and her clothing?

04:20.386 --> 04:24.220
And I’ll need to do tests
to determine age and identity...

04:24.306 --> 04:26.297
that could lead us to the victim.

04:28.769 --> 04:33.308
[ Low Voice ]
I need a sample
of your hair and your clothes...

04:33.399 --> 04:36.186
to find out
where you’re from, okay?

04:36.277 --> 04:38.142

[Jane Grunting]
[ Meacham ]
Will this take much longer?

05:26.160 --> 05:29.903
Dr. Saroyan and I need
any tissue and particulates
that could be from the victim.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.828
- [Grunts]
- Just a few more.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.031
Could we take a break now?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.581
Since you can’t get her
to cooperate,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.124
we have no choice
but to continue.

05:36.212 --> 05:37.167
Do you think I’m not trying?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.040
Perhaps she doesn’t
understand sign language.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.167
She clearly does.
She’s choosing not to help.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.839
Makes her look pretty guilty,
doesn’t it?

05:42.927 --> 05:45.464
There is a presumption
of innocence here, Dr. Hodgins.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.091
Child Protective Services
appointed me to protect that.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.672
Assuming that she is a child.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.678
Dental X-rays
could determine age,

05:51.769 --> 05:54.260
but you’d have
to hold her still for those.

05:54.355 --> 05:57.347
I’m very uncomfortable
with this, Dr. Brennan.
She’s clearly in distress.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.103
[ Brennan ] Right now you have
to see her as evidence, Mr. Vaziri.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.526
Nothing more than a composite
of bone and tissue...

06:02.613 --> 06:05.525
that, as yet, have not yielded
any usable clues.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.358
- And you can do that?
Look at her.
- l have no choice, do I?

06:08.452 --> 06:11.489
Not if we hope to save someone
who might be bleeding out.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.822
Tell her that we need
to do dental X-rays
to establish her age...

06:14.917 --> 06:17.033
and to potentially
locate her family.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.209
- They might know who the victim is.
- If she has a family.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.582
There are no foster children
reported missing in the area,

06:21.674 --> 06:23.210
so she probably
has family somewhere.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.676
[Clears Throat]

06:25.427 --> 06:26.883
[No Audible Dialogue]

06:26.971 --> 06:28.336
No!

06:34.270 --> 06:36.181
What did you get from her?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.682
Particulates from her hair
and clothing...

06:37.773 --> 06:39.513
that might lead us
to whoever she stabbed.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.223
She looks so young.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.980
Don’t get all gushy.
She was caught with
a bloody knife in her hand.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.607
She’s somebody’s kid,
Hodgins.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.654
So was the person
who she stabbed.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.694
Allegedly stabbed.
Really?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.946
| just can’t believe
that a little baby...

06:52.037 --> 06:54.995

to become... her.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.949
Ange, our kid is not gonna
grow up to be a murderer, okay?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.534
We have no idea what happened
to make her turn out like this.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.338
I know. I’m just tired of waddling.
I want to hold the baby.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.086
Yeah. Well, soon enough.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.428
I know. Soon enough.
[Laughs]

07:08.512 --> 07:12.096
Listen, |— there’s kind of a rush
on this evidence, okay? So—

All right. Okay. Sure. Yeah.
Okay. Back to work.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.142
Hey, you got anything?

07:25.237 --> 07:28.445
We’ve been checking all
the hospitals and morgues
for stabbing victims...

07:28.532 --> 07:30.739
within a 50-mile radius
of where Jane Doe was found.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.824
We got nothing.
Yeah, well,
I got something.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.822
You know the bloody money
that we found on the girl?

07:34.913 --> 07:38.371
Assuming she stole
from her victim,
this could be good news.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.495
- You’re cute when you
try to make me happy.
- Right.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.577
Look at that.
Look at all
the 20-dollar bills.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.954
Okay, and what’s that?
I don’t know
what that is.

07:45.049 --> 07:47.335
We found it in her pocket.
Angela’s gonna reconstruct it.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.337
Take a look at the serial
numbers on the bills.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.258
- They’re sequential. Bank robbery?
- No. A.T.M.

07:53.349 --> 07:55.305
A.T.M.’s get sequential
bills from the bank.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.850
If we can trace the number
to the ATM, we should
be able to find our victim.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.893
Now you’re just
downright handsome.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.150
Open.
[ Grunts ]

08:07.237 --> 08:08.443
Open.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.191
I need her
to open her mouth.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.398
If we can’t put the film in her mouth,
we can’t take the X-rays.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.786
[ Device Beeps ]
I realize that. What do
you want me to do?

08:14.870 --> 08:17.111
Well, tell her that
if she doesn’t cooperate,

08:17.206 --> 08:18.787
thenIWIhave
to call the judge...

08:18.874 --> 08:21.661
and ask him to approve
a general anesthetic.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.834
Dr. Brennan, can I talk
to you for a moment?

08:23.921 --> 08:25.661
I’m very busy.
[ Sweets ]

08:25.756 --> 08:28.372
- Just a moment.
- [ Meacham ] Okay?

Either she opens her mouth
or I call the judge.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.640
[ Low Voice ]
Please help.

- restrained by people
she has no reason to trust.
- [ Grunts ]

08:44.483 --> 08:48.067
Being up here on this platform
on display...

08:48.153 --> 08:49.563
makes it much worse, and—

08:49.655 --> 08:52.112
Her feelings are not a priority
right now, Dr. Sweets.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.983
If you knew
the circumstances—
No, I do. I reviewed the case.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.159
If you want
that girl to cooperate,
you need to make sure...

08:57.287 --> 09:00.370
that she feels
comfortable and secure.
I know what I’m doing.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.493
Do you remember
being in foster care?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.666
I wasn’t
a potential murder suspect.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.165
Nevertheless, you must remember
how you were treated.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.964
How often did they
even bother to learn your name?

09:12.511 --> 09:15.218
Every situation was way
more frightening than it had to be...

09:15.305 --> 09:17.341
because some supervisor
was in a rush.

09:17.433 --> 09:18.422
Right?

09:25.858 --> 09:29.316
I know I never wanted to cooperate,
and I’m sure you didn’t either.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.612
[Yells]
She bit me.

09:33.699 --> 09:36.611
She was gagging.
lt’s— It’s not her fault.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.530
She’s terrified.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.577
The dentals aren’t gonna work.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.656
I’d like to try something else.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.169
[ Brennan ]
This is completely noninvasive.

09:53.260 --> 09:57.048
Please tell Jane that this will be
a much easier way to exam her.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.552
She just has to slowly move
her hand through there,
up to her elbow.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.974
We’ll watch
the image on the screen.
She won’t feel a thing.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.928
[ Brennan ]
All right, ljust need
to see the epiphysis...

10:06.023 --> 10:08.139
of the distal radius and ulna.

10:08.233 --> 10:12.067
- [Jane Grunting]
- [ Brennan ] You’re going
to have to hold her steady.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.187
Steady.
[ Meacham ]
Be careful. Be careful with her.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.363
[Arastoo ]
How much longer?
We can’t hold her steady.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.278
[ Grunting Continues]
[ Beeping ]

10:18.368 --> 10:20.279
[ Brennan ]
Okay. We got it.

10:20.370 --> 10:24.283
As you can see,
there’s only partial fusion
of the distal radius and ulna.

10:24.374 --> 10:28.583
She’s definitely
over 13 years old
but less than 17.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.331
So she is a minor.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.882
I’ll let Booth know.

10:37.638 --> 10:41.222
Hey, Bones, no minors
with her description have
been reported missing in DC.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.764
So she stays anonymous.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.384
It happens, Bones, you know.
It happens.
I know. It’sjust—

10:46.814 --> 10:50.147
I saw a lot of kids like her
when l was in the system.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.226
Kids pulled in off the street.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.062
None of them started out bad.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.112
Sorry. I’m being foolish.

11:01.203 --> 11:06.823
No, no. I mean, look,
the day that this gets easy,
we know that we’re in trouble.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.203
Any luck tracking
the money from the ATM?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.285
Yeah. It came from a bodega
in Columbia Heights.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.496
We’ve been pouring through
all these bank records...

11:13.590 --> 11:16.548
of everyone who used that A.T.M.
since it was stocked two days ago.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.793
That could be
dozens of people.
Dozens?

Try hundreds.
[Cell Phone Rings]

11:21.098 --> 11:22.508
It’s Cam. Booth.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.341
I just finished testing the blood
from the girl’s clothing.

11:25.435 --> 11:29.223
Preliminary D.N.A. shows
that the victim was a white male.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.270
A white man
in Columbia Heights.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.314
He’d stand out like
an onion in a bean field.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.644
I’ll tell you what.
Pull up the images
from the camera on the A.T.M.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.194
[ Man ]
I’ve got them here.

11:38.282 --> 11:43.072
Okay, look, what I want you to do
is separate out all the white men.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.950
Cam, did you do a T-cell test?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.496
Yep. The victim’s
in his mid-40s.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.951
[ Booth ]
No. He looks like
a teenager. Thanks.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.377
What about him?
He looks like he’s about 45.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.874
No. The nasolabial lines...

he’s in his 303.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.690

Oh, wow.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.539
Hey.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.872
She might be a kid,
but it looks like
she might be a really bad one.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.762
I hope you find her family
because she’s gonna need
a good attorney.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.932
If she cooperated, I could
work something out
with the juvenile court.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.853
It just doesn’t make any sense.
Why would she kill him and
then take the weapon with her?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.555
Was someone after her?
There must have been a reason.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.015
She’s not gonna
defend herself.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.394
We’ll never know
what she was thinking.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.397
Of course. ’Cause motive
isn’t important to you.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.399
Just the fact that she was the one
wielding the knife, right?

13:01.490 --> 13:03.731
No. In this case,
motive is critical,

13:03.825 --> 13:05.907
but she’s clearly
keeping it to herself.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.451
So we just give up
and put her away
without knowing all the facts?

13:08.538 --> 13:09.789
Is this getting testy?

13:09.873 --> 13:12.660
You obviously have
a very low opinion of me, Dr. Sweets.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.992
Let’s just all take
a deep breath here.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.669
I believe there are facts
we have overlooked...

13:21.093 --> 13:23.209

Oh.

You got a little egg
on your face there.

[ Brennan ]
Duval Price’s door
was oak, two inches thick.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.641
Do any of us believe
that Jane Doe could
have broken down that door,

13:34.731 --> 13:37.188
splintering the wood,
without harming herself?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.438
And why would she target a man
who’s twice her size?

Dr. Brennan.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.858
Sorry.

as everyone assumes, Dr. Sweets.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.044
You said that Jane was signing
during your interrogation?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.588

was recorded?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.729
Stop. Run it back.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.609
She’s saying,
“I need to go to the bathroom.”

14:22.696 --> 14:25.438
Well, why are her
bathroom habits important?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.568
They aren’t,
but the way she signs is.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.570
Can you determine the rate
at which she signs?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.989
The words per minute?
Yeah. Sure.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.950
Now run her signing
on a loop.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.705
Notice the height
of her hands.

from a rural area.

- This is like a dialect?
- It’s exactly like a dialect.

This is why you
wanted me to get the videos
from the linguistics department.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.680
If we can match her dialect,
we can find out where she’s from.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.478

cross scan with the videos.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.004
No wonder she ran away
from home. Look at this guy.
He’s getting impatient.

23:49.137 --> 23:52.129
They can’t see her, Booth.
Look, don’t worry.
l’ll handle it. They’re not—

23:52.265 --> 23:54.756
- Excuse me. What’s the problem?
We wanna see our daughter.
- [ Booth ] No problem.

23:54.851 --> 23:58.469
Why? Are you worried
about what she might say if you
don’t get to her soon enough?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.812
What? Who’s this?
This here is my partner.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.604
Dr. Temperance Brennan
from the Jeffersonian.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.942
[ Booth ]
Let’s go have a cup of coffee.
Here are your X-rays back.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.691
Mr. Shenfield,
this is a court order...

24:08.781 --> 24:11.158
preventing you and your wife
from seeing Amy.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.153
What?
I’m Grace Meacham,

24:13.244 --> 24:15.576
your daughter’s guardian,
from Child Protective Services.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.745
A guardian?
Amy doesn’t need a guardian.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.493
You’ve been beating her
since she was a little girl.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.496
- My God.
We never even touched her.
- She’s lying. She lies.

24:22.587 --> 24:26.000
- No. These don’t lie.
- They certainly convinced a judge.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.832
What did you use here,
a bat or maybe a broom handle?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.008
What about this one,
just your fists?

24:31.095 --> 24:33.381
- I’m getting a lawyer.
- That’s probably the best thing
you can do right now.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.304
Why did you do it?
Because she couldn’t hear?

24:35.391 --> 24:37.973
She had Waardenburg syndrome.
You had to know that.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.926
It’s right here in the X-rays.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.932
All right, Bones, it’s over.
They can’t touch her now.

24:42.065 --> 24:44.351
No. You can’t do this.
Actually, we can.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.649
It’s one of the good things we can do.
Can you get them out of here?

24:46.736 --> 24:49.478
She was born
with Waardenburg syndrome.
It’s genetic.

24:49.572 --> 24:51.528
One of her parents has to have it.
Why didn’t they understand?

24:51.616 --> 24:54.198
Look, not all parents
deserve kids, all right?

24:57.538 --> 24:59.449
Wait.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.576
Oh, my God.
What?

25:01.668 --> 25:04.876
God, what? Now what? Bones.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.421
What the hell
are you doing?
Get your hands off—

25:10.468 --> 25:11.833
Get off!
[ Booth ]
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

25:11.928 --> 25:13.168
Don’t touch her.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.004
Booth, they don’t have
dystopia canthorum...

25:16.099 --> 25:17.509
or high nasal roots.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.182
- Is that good or bad?
- They aren’t Amy’s parents.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.260
Amy is not their daughter.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.488
This is the copy
of the birth certificate
you were using. It’s fake.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.575
Amy is ours.
Don’t say anything, Denise.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.699
Dr. Brennan has determined
that the abuse started at age three,

25:40.790 --> 25:42.701
which means
she was safe until then.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.124
How did she wind up
living with you?

25:47.797 --> 25:49.287
Who’s Duval Price?

25:50.633 --> 25:52.498
He’s notjust some random person.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.293
Come on.
We’re gonna find out.

25:55.388 --> 25:59.757
- What, did you pimp her out?
- No. We would never do
something like that.

25:59.851 --> 26:02.968
Whatever happened to that guy,
it was her doing.

26:03.104 --> 26:06.221
She ran away.
She killed him for his money.
She was troubled.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.727
We tried everything.
We loved her.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.934
Loved her?
Loved her by beating her?

26:11.028 --> 26:13.314
Agent Booth, please.
I understand.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.940
- You understand what, Sweets?
- Amy is disabled.
They devoted their lives to her.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.071
Every now and then
you lost your patience.
It happens, right?

26:20.163 --> 26:23.451
- What are you, crazy?
- They fed her and clothed her.
They even taught her to sign.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.998
- Sweets—
- He’s right. We were good to her.

26:26.085 --> 26:30.328
- Denise, you need to shut up.
- Why? We just wanted her to mind.

26:30.423 --> 26:34.257
She would never
have a normal life
if she didn’t mind.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.676
- And that was her fault?
- They tried, Agent Booth.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.796
They tried.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.261
I know that.

26:42.351 --> 26:46.310
And I’m sure now you don’t
want anything to happen to Amy.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.012
- Of course not.
- Denise—

26:48.107 --> 26:50.689
Her life could be ruined
if you don’t help us.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.564
Just tell us what happened.
I mean, you said you loved her.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.360
- I do.
- I said shut up!

26:55.448 --> 26:56.483
[Yells]

27:01.537 --> 27:03.994
[ Denise Crying ]

27:14.342 --> 27:18.085
Mr. Vaziri found a nick
on the inside of the manubrium.

27:18.179 --> 27:22.388
It seems likely
that the weapon went through
the fourth intercostal spaces...

27:22.475 --> 27:24.716
and penetrated so deeply
that it nicked the inside
of his manubrium.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.427
But if he was stabbed in the back,
that mark makes no sense.

27:27.522 --> 27:28.978
It’s too high.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.851
Her bloody fingerprints
clearly show...

27:30.942 --> 27:34.184
that she was holding
the knife this way.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.860
Holding it like this?

27:36.948 --> 27:39.815
There’s no way she could have made
the nick on the manubrium.

27:39.909 --> 27:42.776
Unless she did not
sneak up behind him.

27:42.912 --> 27:46.029
Okay, I still don’t understand.
They were face-to-face.

27:46.123 --> 27:49.661
Duval Price
knocks her down.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.868
He landed on top of her.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.788
Mr. Vaziri.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.045
- This is very awkward.
- Mr. Vaziri, this is part of yourjob.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.672
- Then I would like to quit
this part of the job.
- Don’t move.

28:00.763 --> 28:03.345
All right,
she stabbed him like this.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.263
- So it wasn’t murder?
- No.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.592
Amy was just trying
to defend herself.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.472
Can I get up now?

28:12.567 --> 28:14.353
Yes. Of course.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.025
The door to his apartment
was made of painted,
kiln-dried oak...

28:17.113 --> 28:19.570
which contained
9.4% moisture.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.613
Now, on the night
Duval Price was killed,

28:21.701 --> 28:26.195
it was 65 degrees
with an 86% relative humidity.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.325
It was just about to rain.

28:28.416 --> 28:31.328
So, when the door broke,
the splinters swelled—

28:31.460 --> 28:34.327
kind of like my pregnant feet.
That’s right.

28:34.422 --> 28:38.836
The moisture
in the exposed wood, right?
It was 37.4%,

28:38.926 --> 28:41.383
meaning that the splinters
had been exposed to the humidity...

28:41.470 --> 28:43.461
since about 2:00 am.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.343
Well, Cam put Price’s time of death
at about midnight.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.800
Which means that the door
was broken open...

28:48.895 --> 28:52.604
almost two hours after
Duval Price was killed.

28:52.690 --> 28:55.181
So someone else knocked it down,

28:55.276 --> 28:58.268
saw Price dead
and just left him there.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.775
Yeah. My guess—
someone that knew Amy
was being held there.

29:01.866 --> 29:06.235
Lucky for us,
he left behind fibers
from a PriceCo flannel shirt.

29:06.329 --> 29:08.786
No way. My genius.

29:08.915 --> 29:12.373
Ohh! Oh!
Oh, God.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.917
Oh, don’t worry. It’s nothing.
It’s nothing. Ohh!

29:15.004 --> 29:17.211
Okay, that is
definitely something.

29:17.298 --> 29:20.040
Oh, my God.
Oh, God! Okay.

29:20.134 --> 29:24.127
Baby! Oh, okay. Baby!
Okay, okay. Baby!

29:24.221 --> 29:25.927
According to the birthing class,

29:26.015 --> 29:28.222
that is so not how you’re
supposed to react right now.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.641
Right. Right.
Uh, ! should— I should—

29:30.728 --> 29:32.389
- Get the car!
- Get the car. Okay.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.971
I’m gonna get the car.
Yeah.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.393
Yeah. Good idea.
Keys. Oh, I need keys.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.521
Where are my keys?
Where the hell are my keys?

29:39.612 --> 29:41.568
Don’t look at me like that, babe.
I know what I’m doing, okay?

29:41.656 --> 29:43.692
I’m gonna—
I’m gonna get the keys.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.900
I’m totally and completely calm.
Where the hell are my keys?

29:46.994 --> 29:49.371
Oh, wow. Men are
so not made for this.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.288
Honey, the keys, hon.
Do you have ’em, babe?

29:52.375 --> 29:54.912
Do you have keys?
Okay, I’m gonna find them.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.960
So, where are we?

29:58.047 --> 30:00.163
The forensic techs, they went
through Price’s apartment.

30:00.299 --> 30:05.134
Right by the phone,
guess what they found—
a notepad that says 122 and 11:55.

30:05.221 --> 30:07.928
That’s the number
of the bus she took
and the time it arrived in DC.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.926
So I check his phone records.
Guess who called him...

30:10.017 --> 30:12.724
an hour after he left
Cross Roads, PA.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.639
Mike Shenfield.
That’s right.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.893
I hope he squirms.
I like it when they squirm.

30:21.028 --> 30:25.567
[ Brennan ]
We know what happened, Amy.
You couldn’t bear it anymore.

30:26.784 --> 30:28.649
No one believed you,

30:28.744 --> 30:30.735
so you ran away.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.830
[ Booth ]
We found this photo
in Price’s apartment.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.128
You actually saw Amy
take a bus to DC,

30:41.215 --> 30:43.297
and you couldn’t risk
her telling anybody
what you did to her.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.796
So you called
your friend.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.799
[ Brennan ]
Duval Price followed you
when you got off the bus.

30:49.890 --> 30:53.553
He grabbed you and he took you
back to his apartment.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.431
He said that your father
was going to come and get you.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.023
He was going
to tie me up.

31:01.110 --> 31:04.147
He was going
to hit me.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.650
You got there
as soon as you could,
but there was no answer.

31:06.741 --> 31:08.777
So what do you do?
You break down his door.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.693
When you realized
what happened,

31:11.787 --> 31:15.154
you left your friend lying
in the pool of his own blood,
and you ran.

31:15.249 --> 31:17.365
We have fibers
we can match
to your clothes.

31:17.460 --> 31:21.248
This wasn’t Amy’s fault.
You had him kidnap her.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.463
I tried to get away.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.762
I took the knife
off the counter
just to scare him.

31:31.849 --> 31:35.512
He grabbed me, and we fell.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.764
He raised his hand
to hit me.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.893
He was going
to hit me.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.311
You were protecting
yourself, Amy.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.150
[ Meacham ]
But I killed a man.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.791
But I killed a man.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.365
Sorry.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.876
It’s your fault
that Duval Price is dead.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.467
I’ll tell you what.
You know what?

32:10.554 --> 32:12.590
You can still do
something decent here.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.808
You tell me
where you took Amy from.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.682
Fine.

32:26.362 --> 32:29.570
The only satisfaction I get
is knowing what happens
to people in prison...

32:29.657 --> 32:31.363
who abuse kids.

32:37.039 --> 32:38.745
[Sighs]

32:41.210 --> 32:43.792
They aren’t
your parents, Amy.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.997
We believe you were kidnapped
when you were about three.

32:54.265 --> 32:57.553
Before you were with them,
no one hurt you.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.768
[ Meacham ]
So, who am I?

33:07.736 --> 33:09.237
I don’t know.

33:13.868 --> 33:16.200
But I will find out.

33:16.287 --> 33:19.029
We will find out—
together.

33:32.094 --> 33:35.461
The Missing Persons Database
can’t be much help...

33:35.556 --> 33:39.890
if we don’t know
where you were born or grew up.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.725
I don’t know.
I don’t remember
anything before them.

33:45.816 --> 33:48.193
Yeah, it’s tough.
I know. I know.

33:48.277 --> 33:51.269
Especially since
you’ve had so many
difficult years.

33:51.363 --> 33:56.608
It took me a long time
to be able to remember
when l was young...

33:56.702 --> 34:00.661
because I didn’t trust
the happy memories.

34:00.748 --> 34:02.613
I couldn’t believe them.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.957
Not with the life
I was living in foster homes.

34:11.133 --> 34:12.919
How did you remember?

34:15.304 --> 34:18.888
Some images just...
wouldn’t go away.

34:18.974 --> 34:23.434
I would close my eyes at night
and I’d see a woman,

34:23.520 --> 34:25.977
um, my mother,

34:27.399 --> 34:29.310
with me in her lap.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.689
We were having a picnic
on the beach.

34:32.780 --> 34:36.238
She was cutting me
a big piece of chocolate cake,

34:36.325 --> 34:38.611
and we were laughing.

34:46.543 --> 34:50.161
Uh, remembering
moments like those...

34:50.256 --> 34:53.293
can make a difficult
situation worse...

34:53.384 --> 34:56.342
if you think you can never
be happy like that again.

35:00.349 --> 35:02.305
But if you see a chance,

35:03.727 --> 35:05.433
give yourself hope.

35:05.521 --> 35:09.139
You can allow yourself to believe
that those moments are real.

35:27.042 --> 35:30.705
[ Meacham ]
A bunny. I remember
a little stuffed bunny.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.707
I slept with it
all the time.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.789
Okay. Uh, anything else?

35:34.883 --> 35:38.467
Do you remember
where you played,
what it looked like?

35:38.554 --> 35:41.466
A tree? If we can locate
where you lived—

35:41.557 --> 35:43.764
[ Meacham ]
I don’t remember anything else.

35:43.851 --> 35:46.263
Just my bunny.
That’s all.

35:53.319 --> 35:57.187
This might seem like
a strange request,

35:57.281 --> 36:01.194
but I would like permission to have
one of your wisdom teeth pulled.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.828
When you were an infant,

36:06.915 --> 36:10.624
your permanent teeth
were developing
deep in yourjawbone,

36:10.711 --> 36:16.331
accumulating specific isotopes
from the environment where you lived.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.666
Her tooth can tell you
where she grew up?

36:18.761 --> 36:20.217
Absolutely.

36:26.101 --> 36:28.012
Yeah!
[ Meacham ]
Yes.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.310
- Yeah!
- Thank you. Yes.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.773
[ Amy I
