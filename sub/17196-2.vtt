(emmett)
the body of a 12-year-old child

00:07.541 --> 00:09.208
Was found on north beach
here in gracepoint.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.843
Oh, god.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.211

I know who you are.

We're now classifying this death
as a suspected homicide.

Till then,

00:21.989 --> 00:23.188
I just saw chloe
at the beach.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.523
She was leaving
a stuffed animal.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.059
I did not confirm that.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.360
<i>(chloe)</i>
<i>they released his name.</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:30.362
Who told that journalist?

00:30.364 --> 00:31.730
Someone wanted to make it
look like an accident,

00:31.732 --> 00:33.399

00:33.401 --> 00:34.867
Where were you last night?

00:34.869 --> 00:37.136
I told you.
I was working.

has any information,

00:42.243 --> 00:44.476

01:51.479 --> 01:53.378
I did?
You were shouting.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.115
What--what was I saying?

01:56.117 --> 01:57.649
We couldn't really tell,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.718
But we heard you say "danny."

02:04.157 --> 02:05.824
Are you going to work today?

02:05.826 --> 02:09.595
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I have to.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.763
Will I have to talk
to the police?

02:11.765 --> 02:16.268
Not today, but soon, probably.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.471
When I do talk to them,
could it be with you?

02:19.473 --> 02:23.442
I don't think so, sweetie.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.743
Why?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.645
Is there something
you want to tell me?

02:26.647 --> 02:27.980
No.

Listen, I don't want you

I walked danny's route

past six weeks.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.397
And there's a camera
at the lookout, 50 yards down.

Get the footage.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.166
How's the house-to-house?

We've got five officers
on it,

down from redwood.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.556

06:31.558 --> 06:34.593
He will be posted outside

No offense.

06:57.017 --> 07:01.353

that I can do for you now

07:01.355 --> 07:04.556
Is to find out
who killed danny, okay?

07:04.558 --> 07:07.459
Yeah.
Okay.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.961
Chloe, sweetheart,

07:09.963 --> 07:11.963
And how about the funeral?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.199
Can we at least start
planning that?

07:15.268 --> 07:16.368
Not yet.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.969
Oh.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.604
Until we find
the person responsible

07:19.606 --> 07:22.107
And we have him in custody,
then danny's--

07:22.109 --> 07:24.476
<i>His body, it's--</i>

07:24.478 --> 07:27.379
Look, I'm sorry

But it's the most valuable
piece of evidence we have.

We cannot allow the body
to be buried

08:41.688 --> 08:43.788
Thinking
about him last night.

08:43.790 --> 08:48.226
Danny had been a big part
of the wildlife group

On and off, doing his shifts.

A good heart.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.370
It matters, good heart.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.642
You said you remembered
something about seeing danny.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.876
Yes, I did.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.746
About a couple of weeks ago--

09:07.748 --> 09:10.682
Or maybe it was ten days--

09:10.684 --> 09:14.319
I was taking a walk
up the cliff path

09:14.321 --> 09:16.755
Out by osprey point,

09:16.757 --> 09:19.424
About 7:30 in the morning.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.994
And I saw him with someone.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.362
With who?

09:24.364 --> 09:27.566
I don't know.

09:27.568 --> 09:30.168
But he was out on the cliff
with someone.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.537
He had his notebook
in his lap,

09:32.539 --> 09:33.838
Danny did--

09:33.840 --> 09:38.944
The one they use
to record sea life with.

09:38.946 --> 09:43.415
But he was turned to talk
to this young fellow.

09:43.417 --> 09:48.753
Hiker boots, big pack--
backpacker.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.555
Medium height.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.957
He had a bandana on.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.793
Danny looked far more interested

09:54.795 --> 09:58.530
In talking to him
than he did in counting whales.

09:58.532 --> 10:00.532
Danny laughed about something.

10:00.534 --> 10:04.269
Seemed innocent at the time.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.738
It was only after
you were in yesterday

10:06.740 --> 10:10.108
That I remembered.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.309
I sure hope this doesn't have

10:11.311 --> 10:14.746
Anything to do
with what happened.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.616
I'd feel terrible if it did.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.488
Have you told my mom and dad?
Not yet.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.290
Please don't.
It's not mine.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.292
It was in your room.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.227
I don't use it.
I swear I don't.
Do you deal it?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.729
No, of course not, I--

10:30.731 --> 10:32.163
So if you don't use it

10:32.165 --> 10:33.465
And you don't deal it,

10:33.467 --> 10:36.835
Then why did you have it?

10:36.837 --> 10:39.004
Did somebody ask you
to hold it for them?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.907
Are you trying to protect
that person?

10:42.909 --> 10:44.509
It's just one tiny bag.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.479
Okay, then why don't we
go tell your mom that.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.847
No. No, no, no.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.915
You said you wouldn't.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.918
Chloe, possession
of a schedule I drug

10:53.920 --> 10:55.487
Is a criminal offense.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.023
Dealing a schedule I drug
is a criminal offense.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.991
I was just handing it off.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.695
That is called dealing.

11:03.697 --> 11:07.666
You will not get in trouble
if you tell me the truth.

11:07.668 --> 11:11.403
Who gave you that cocaine?

11:12.438 --> 11:13.672
Gemma fisher.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.340
At the inn?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.275
I work for her
cleaning rooms sometimes.

Housekeeper.
Glamorous.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.445
What about the money?

11:20.447 --> 11:21.613
What money?

11:21.615 --> 11:24.516
Chloe, do not be
a smart-ass with me.

11:24.518 --> 11:27.218
I don't know anything
about any money, I swear.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.457
Why would gemma fisher
be giving a 15-year-old cocaine?

11:32.459 --> 11:33.725
[sighs]
oh, my god.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.193
I'm gonna get in
so much trouble.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.828
Did danny have anything to do
with drugs?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.063
Anything?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.330
No!

11:39.332 --> 11:41.533
No, not at all.
He--

11:41.535 --> 11:44.202
God, please,
just leave me alone.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.538
I just want to curl up
and die.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.976
I didn't mean that.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.978
(gemma)
"we miss him terribly.

11:53.980 --> 11:57.248
He's left a hole
in gracepoint's heart."

11:57.250 --> 11:58.883
Does that just
make it worse?

11:58.885 --> 12:01.319
What could make it worse?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.688
There are three tents
on the beach now.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.223
Any idea
when they're gonna come down?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.258
When they're done,
I guess.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.760
Not soon.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.495
You know, when they catch
whoever did this,

12:10.497 --> 12:11.896
I vote for a public lynching.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.331
They should string them up.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.768

I'll need the printer too.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.551

15:34.034 --> 15:35.233
There was a couple

15:35.235 --> 15:37.268
Down from seattle
for the weekend.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.370
They were staying
in a suite,

Spending lots of money.

They asked me if I could
get them some coke.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.777
Chloe was working that day,

15:45.779 --> 15:48.613

the couple had gone.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.985

And where did chloe
get it from?

15:55.956 --> 15:57.221
She said a friend.

He just knew where
to get some.

to do with that.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.339
We need to process the offense.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.174
I know this was really stupid,

16:16.176 --> 16:19.811
But is there any way
we can do this quietly?

16:19.813 --> 16:22.180
I mean, I could lose my license
for this.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.648
Make a time to come down
to the station

16:23.650 --> 16:25.283
And give a formal statement.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.252
You'll be charged,

That way, we'll have

24:29.969 --> 24:32.903
That's what you have
to teach me?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.338
You're gonna have to do
your best

24:34.340 --> 24:35.506
To try to see this town
from the outside.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.475
I can't be outside.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.276
I don't want to be outside.

24:39.278 --> 24:41.345
You can't be objective.
You're not the right fit.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.481
Or maybe you're not
the right fit.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.116
Swooping in here, taking over,

You bark orders

We're dealing with

[paper crinkles]

24:55.127 --> 24:57.127
Sorry.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.697
It's a simple truth, miller.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.832
Anybody's capable of murder,

25:01.834 --> 25:03.701
Given the right
circumstances.
No.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.437
Most people...

25:06.439 --> 25:08.272
Have a moral compass.

What's this about?

26:19.745 --> 26:22.513
Jon kurtz from the park service

26:22.515 --> 26:24.515
Said you have the keys
to the harvey ridge house.

26:24.517 --> 26:26.917
I clean it.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.218
He said he'd phone ahead,

26:28.220 --> 26:29.753
Let you know
to have them ready.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.256
My phone's dead.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.390
I need those keys.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.225
I have to look inside.
Why?

26:35.227 --> 26:37.595
Something to do with that boy?

26:37.597 --> 26:40.097
I'll bring the keys back
when we're done.

You'd think after something
like this,

28:02.715 --> 28:05.549
We'd get even more.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.718
I guess nothing's a given.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.720
Except christmas.

And easter.

Even mark came last easter.

Oh, did he?
I don't remember.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.126

Reach out to her, would you?

28:25.471 --> 28:30.174
You've always been
so good for her.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.143
I just--I figured
I'd give her some space.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.579
Well, sometimes people don't
know what they need

28:35.581 --> 28:37.214
Until it's given to them.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.849
I'm praying that's why

28:38.851 --> 28:41.585
God brought you back
to gracepoint...

I don't want to.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.945
You want to try to do
something normal,

29:07.947 --> 29:08.946
See how it feels?

29:08.948 --> 29:10.447
Nothing will ever be normal.

29:10.449 --> 29:14.685
I know that's
what you think right now,

29:14.687 --> 29:17.020
But it's not always
gonna feel like this.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.425
Do you want to talk about it?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.940
Do we keep our kids inside?

30:09.942 --> 30:11.809

not to do this.

Who told you?

I have this thing.

For crying out loud,
who let you in?

No, it's important.
Please don't ignore me.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.557
I am supposed to tell you

31:33.559 --> 31:35.425
That's it's--
it's like--

31:35.427 --> 31:38.161
It's like he was in a boat
or he was put in a boat.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.763
I don't know why.

31:39.765 --> 31:43.267
Who's telling you this?
Where'd you get this from?

31:45.503 --> 31:47.971
Danny.

31:54.712 --> 31:56.113
(renee)
so tell me about gracepoint.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.016
Well, it's the only town
for 20 miles,

31:59.018 --> 32:00.784
One road in, one road out.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.686
People come
for whale-watching season,

32:02.688 --> 32:04.421
Tourists, and then again
the summer,

32:04.423 --> 32:07.824
But basically,
we're just a working town.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.895
We've never had a murder here.

32:11.897 --> 32:14.331
I do a weekly crime report
in the <i>journal,</i> so...

32:15.466 --> 32:17.901
Don't you want more than that?

32:17.903 --> 32:21.605
You're a good writer.
You could do what I did.

32:21.607 --> 32:26.209
Work for a legit newspaper,
a good news site.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.911
How you know
I'm a good writer, huh?

32:27.913 --> 32:32.049
You look me up too?

32:32.051 --> 32:35.285
I followed emmett carver
on his last case.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.820
He fumbled
the rosemont investigation,

32:36.822 --> 32:38.989
Then he all but vanished.

32:38.991 --> 32:42.259
Those, um--
those two kids who went missing?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.328
Three. Three girls.

32:44.330 --> 32:47.230
Nina, sidney, megan.

32:47.232 --> 32:51.835
Now suddenly he's here,
working this case.

32:53.604 --> 32:57.107
If you care about this town--
well, what happened here--

32:57.109 --> 32:59.009
Help me out.

32:59.011 --> 33:03.413
Introduce me to people, help me
write about what's going on.

33:03.415 --> 33:06.683
You do that, I might be able
to help you.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.552
What do you think?

33:10.254 --> 33:12.756
State your home address.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.925

33:14.927 --> 33:15.993
Where is that?

33:15.995 --> 33:18.295
It's 40 miles east of here.

33:18.297 --> 33:21.598
And you're saying danny solano
wants us to know

33:21.600 --> 33:24.101
That he was put in
a boat before he died.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.669
Yes.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.471
And I want you to know that
nothing offends me more

33:27.473 --> 33:29.773
Than cranks
wasting police time.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.508
I don't ask for these messages.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.943
They just come to you.

33:32.945 --> 33:35.012
Did this one come to you
before or after

33:35.014 --> 33:36.947
Your company sent you here

33:36.949 --> 33:39.049
To put in extra phone lines?
After.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.384
Amazing.
I love this.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.952
The telephone guy
who hears voices.

33:41.954 --> 33:44.621
I didn't ask for this,
but I do hear it.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.623
If you don't want to listen,
that's fine.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.225
Oh, you're a reluctant psychic.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.227
A child has died,

33:50.229 --> 33:52.396
And you come here with this
self-promoting crap.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.898
Did you ever meet
danny solano?

33:54.900 --> 33:57.334
No.
Do you know his family?

33:57.336 --> 33:58.869
No, I don't think so.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.337
Do you have
any concrete evidence

34:00.339 --> 34:02.806
Relating to the death
of danny solano?

34:02.808 --> 34:05.542
Well, it depends on what
you think is concrete evidence.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.211
Would you be willing to give
dna and fingerprint samples

34:08.213 --> 34:10.480
For elimination purposes?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.648
Yeah, I suppose.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.884
Okay.

34:13.886 --> 34:16.686
Interview terminated,
2:47 p.M.

34:16.688 --> 34:20.057
You know what happens around
a murder, mr. Connelly?

34:20.059 --> 34:21.725
A whole industry crops up.

34:21.727 --> 34:25.862
Groupies, rubberneckers
who want a part of it.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.665
You're only the first.

34:28.667 --> 34:32.736
Don't let me see you here again.

34:42.413 --> 34:45.482
She says she forgives you
about the pendant.

34:53.357 --> 34:54.691
Every big case,

34:54.693 --> 34:56.259
These roaches crawl out
of the woodwork.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.627
What did he mean
about the pendant?

34:57.629 --> 34:58.795
He has the nerve to come
into our office--

34:58.797 --> 35:00.130
Check his prints!

35:00.132 --> 35:01.865
Find out who he is,
what he wants.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.300
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>okay.</i>
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

35:04.569 --> 35:08.038
Oh, thank you very much.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.739
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>where are you going?</i>

35:09.741 --> 35:13.076
Mark solano lied to us
about where he was that night.

35:13.078 --> 35:15.579
You check the--
wait, wait.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.147
They went through danny's
hard drive.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.717
Apparently, he was keeping
some kind of journal.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.954
"November 9th:
A mountain of homework.

First and foremost, our prayers
are with the solano family.

36:07.099 --> 36:09.799
But the light shines
in the darkness,

36:09.801 --> 36:12.536
And the darkness
has not overcome it.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.770
We're a strong community.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.273
I hope the people who live here

36:16.275 --> 36:17.974

Mark?

36:34.960 --> 36:37.027
Mark! Mark!

Don't just stand there.
Go after him!

Stop talking about us!
Mark, mark.

Stay away from my family...
Calm down, please.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.575
And stay away from beth.

No! Your god left my son

Mark...
You're too late, pal.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.789
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I--

37:12.230 --> 37:15.765
How your parents holding up?

37:15.767 --> 37:18.034
They watch tv and fight.

37:18.036 --> 37:22.872
Pretty normal, just more so.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.942
Want to go back to my place?

37:25.944 --> 37:28.245
The police found the coke.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.679
What?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.114
They were searching the house.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.682
What'd you tell them?
Nothing.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.417
Where do they think
you got it?

37:34.419 --> 37:35.919
They don't know.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.589
They didn't push it,
so I didn't tell them.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.024
Don't look at me like that.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.559
Well, just because
they didn't push it,

37:42.561 --> 37:44.361
Doesn't mean they'll just
forget about it.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.630
Chloe, I can't have
the police at my house.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.198
My uncle'd kill me.
You know that.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.566
What do you want me to do?

37:49.568 --> 37:51.268
I'm sorry, dean.
I didn't realize

37:51.270 --> 37:53.203
You're the most important
person in this whole thing.

37:53.205 --> 37:54.704
I'm sorry I didn't know
my little brother

37:54.706 --> 37:56.039
Was gonna get killed,
and the police

37:56.041 --> 37:57.707
Would be crawling
all over my house

37:57.709 --> 38:00.210
And my mom wouldn't be able
to stop crying all the time.

38:00.212 --> 38:02.379
Okay, okay.
Okay.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.114
I'm sorry.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.949
Chloe.

38:07.418 --> 38:10.287
I'm going home.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.889
You want a ride?
I'm gonna walk.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.624
Come on, chloe.
Let me give you a ride.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.092
I'm fine.
I want to walk.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.995
I'll talk to you later.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.272
Excuse me.

38:29.274 --> 38:32.342
Can I borrow a light?

38:35.246 --> 38:36.413
[lighter clicks]

38:39.150 --> 38:40.817
You're chloe, right?

38:40.819 --> 38:44.020
Why?
I'm sorry for what happened
to your brother.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.626
I'm guessing this meant
a lot to him.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.094
What are you doing
with that?

38:51.096 --> 38:53.196
Listen, you can't leave
that down there.

38:53.198 --> 38:56.166
It'll get stolen
or end up in the papers.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.600
You'll never see it again.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.636
I just wanted to leave
something.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.671
Not something
that's meaningful.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.040
There's too many vultures
around.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.543
How do you know so much?
I'm one of them.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.778
I work for
the <i>san francisco globe</i>

39:08.780 --> 39:10.513
We're not talking
to the papers.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.782
I know.
You're right not to.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.050
I really just came
to give you that

39:14.052 --> 39:16.519
And stop someone
from stealing it.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.788
If it was my brother,
I wouldn't want some stranger

39:18.790 --> 39:21.358
Selling that online.

39:21.360 --> 39:24.828
Thanks.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.897
Can I borrow your phone?

39:35.072 --> 39:36.639
What are you doing?

39:36.641 --> 39:39.175
I won't call you,
I won't come to your door,

39:39.177 --> 39:41.578
But if you and your family
ever need to talk,

39:41.580 --> 39:46.516
You just need a friend
if things get to be too much,

39:46.518 --> 39:48.585
Call me.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.923
Thanks for the light.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.496
(emmett)
Thursday night,

39:59.498 --> 40:03.433
The night danny didn't come
home, where were you?

40:03.435 --> 40:04.667
I was on a job.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.770
I got a call--I don't know,

40:06.772 --> 40:09.038
Like, 9:00.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.408
A family had no hot water,

40:11.410 --> 40:12.942
No heating--
everything was down.

40:12.944 --> 40:16.079
How long did that take?
Most of the night.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.281
The boiler was ancient.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.250
I was there really late.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.018
No.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.219
What do you mean "no"?

40:23.221 --> 40:24.687
There was no job.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.756
We have video footage
of the lookout

40:26.758 --> 40:28.792
Down the hill
from harvey ridge.

40:28.794 --> 40:31.394
You were there at 10:30.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.730
What,
you're snooping on me?

40:33.732 --> 40:37.033
We're checking all the security
footage in the area.

40:38.702 --> 40:41.938
What were you doing
that night?

40:41.940 --> 40:44.441
Am I a suspect?

40:44.443 --> 40:46.209
First thing we do
is eliminate people

40:46.211 --> 40:47.744
From the investigation.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.712
You tell me where you were,
who you were with,

40:49.714 --> 40:50.880
How long you were with them--

40:50.882 --> 40:52.816
I eliminate you from suspicion.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.284
If you don't tell me
those facts,

40:54.286 --> 40:55.819
I can't eliminate you.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.220
You're a potential suspect.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.721
In my own son's murder?

40:58.723 --> 41:01.458
I'm sure there's
a simple explanation.

41:05.162 --> 41:06.362
(hugo)
take a look at this.

41:08.232 --> 41:09.732
It's a match
for danny's blood type.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.234
Do you think
he was killed here?

41:11.236 --> 41:13.102
We believe so, yes.

41:13.104 --> 41:16.139
There's also kids'
sneaker prints, size 6,

41:16.141 --> 41:17.474
All over this area.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.410
Size 6? That's it?
No others?

41:20.412 --> 41:23.179
Well, yeah, mine.
My guys.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.481
Every dog walker that's
been through here

41:24.483 --> 41:25.682
Since Thursday night.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.817
So he was killed here,

41:27.819 --> 41:29.619
And moved two miles
down the coast

41:29.621 --> 41:32.121
To where we found him.

41:32.123 --> 41:35.124
Why would someone do that?

41:35.126 --> 41:37.193
The guys have been all over
this place.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.496
Someone scrubbed it,
top to bottom,

41:39.498 --> 41:42.265
With one exception.

41:43.634 --> 41:46.269
I need to know where
you were that night.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.839
[sighs]

41:49.841 --> 41:51.541
I met a friend.

41:51.543 --> 41:55.712
<i>We had some drinks,</i>
<i>and then I got dropped off</i>

41:55.714 --> 41:58.381
At the parking lot,
then I came home.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.650
[pen clicks]
what time?

42:00.652 --> 42:02.619
[paper rustles]

42:02.621 --> 42:05.822
I don't know.
4:00 in the morning.

42:05.824 --> 42:09.692
[sniffs]
what's your friend's name?

42:09.694 --> 42:11.828
I can't remember.

42:11.830 --> 42:15.698
You can't remember the name
of your friend?

42:15.700 --> 42:19.369
Where did you go?

42:19.371 --> 42:22.171
We had some drinks.
I think we had some food.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.674
Drove around.
You think?
This was five days ago.

42:24.676 --> 42:27.343
Well, a lot's happened
in five days.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.045
[distant noise]

42:29.047 --> 42:30.647
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>and is there any reason</i>

42:30.649 --> 42:32.048
You wouldn't want me
to know

42:32.050 --> 42:35.151
The name of your friend?

42:35.153 --> 42:37.921
When you came in,
you went straight to bed?

42:37.923 --> 42:39.222
Yep.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.324
Can your wife confirm
when you came back?

42:41.326 --> 42:43.026
No.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.328
She was asleep.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.163
Mark...

42:47.165 --> 42:49.232
I'm gonna give you another
chance to tell me who you met.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.233
[phone vibrates]

42:50.235 --> 42:53.102
Yeah.

42:53.104 --> 42:56.172
Sorry.

42:57.708 --> 42:58.741
What?

42:58.743 --> 43:00.243
I'm at the hut.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.612
Csi thinks
it's where danny was killed.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.581
Anything else?
<i>(ellie)</i>
<i>yeah.</i>

43:04.583 --> 43:06.349
The whole place
was scrubbed clean,

43:06.351 --> 43:08.751
But we did find one set
of prints by the sink.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.587
I had them sent in
to run a match

43:10.589 --> 43:12.889
Against elimination prints.

43:12.891 --> 43:15.625
The prints belong
to mark solano.
