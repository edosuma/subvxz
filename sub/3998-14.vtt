WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:02.040
- All right!
- Yes!

00:02.179 --> 00:03.914
Don't touch my shin
every time there's a big play.

00:03.924 --> 00:06.216
- Yeah, no, I got it. Oh, yes!
- Don't touch it every time!

00:06.531 --> 00:07.335
Hey, man, stop.

00:07.893 --> 00:10.431
- Oh!
- Oh! There it is!

00:10.609 --> 00:11.755
- No!
- Hey, Nick.

00:11.793 --> 00:13.781
Um, Jess left her panties in the dryer.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.361
- You mind if I move 'em?
- Sure, man, I don't care.

00:15.695 --> 00:16.834
Wait a second. Why do you ask?

00:17.156 --> 00:18.939
You're not gonna move them in a
weird way or something, are you?

00:18.973 --> 00:20.907
No, dude, I'm just trying
to be respectful, that's all.

00:20.942 --> 00:22.175
You know, before you
and Jess were together,

00:22.210 --> 00:23.877
I moved her panties
hundreds of times, so...

00:23.911 --> 00:25.412
- Wait, what?
- Hundreds of times?

00:25.446 --> 00:27.414
What, are you just hanging
around the-the dryer

00:27.448 --> 00:29.516
like some sort of panty-hawk?

00:29.550 --> 00:31.117
- What? -
Panty-hawk.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.219
I'd watch that show.

00:32.253 --> 00:33.954
So should I just go move them, or...

00:33.988 --> 00:35.088
Nick, he's being weird.
You gotta move 'em.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.289
Oh, so now I'm the panty mover?

00:36.324 --> 00:37.190
Yeah, you're the boyfriend.

00:37.225 --> 00:39.759
- That's not a life!
- Who the hell is gonna move the panties?

00:39.794 --> 00:40.560
Coach, you move 'em.

00:40.595 --> 00:41.595
Are they warm from the dryer?

00:41.629 --> 00:42.729
You know what? You're out.

00:42.763 --> 00:44.531
- Grow up. I'll move the panties.
- Thank you.

00:44.565 --> 00:46.433
Ooh, seems awfully eager.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.401
Yeah, you're awfully
eager, here, Schmidt.

00:48.436 --> 00:51.838
Oh, yeah. I been waiting my entire life
to move your girlfriend's panties...

00:51.872 --> 00:53.373
Stop saying "panties," bro.

00:53.407 --> 00:54.274
Panties.

00:54.308 --> 00:55.408
No, they're panties.

00:55.443 --> 00:56.610
With a "D." Pandies.

00:56.644 --> 00:57.677
Pandies.

00:57.712 --> 00:58.845
Say "panties" like a normal person.

00:58.879 --> 00:59.879
No, this is how black people say it.

00:59.914 --> 01:01.381
Pull your "pannies" down.

01:01.415 --> 01:02.549
- No "T" in there.
- We say "pannies." Yeah.

01:02.583 --> 01:03.717
Here's how a white dude says it.

01:03.751 --> 01:04.950
Pull your panties down.

01:04.986 --> 01:07.921
Guys, honestly, can you not see
what the panties are doing to us?

01:07.955 --> 01:09.923
Stop saying "panties" when
it comes to Jess, everybody.

01:09.957 --> 01:12.058
This is exactly why none of
us should live with a woman.

01:12.093 --> 01:14.060
I've got an idea.

01:14.095 --> 01:17.897
You guys are never gonna believe what...

01:20.434 --> 01:22.569
You know what? I don't care.

01:22.603 --> 01:24.104
The most amazing thing just happened.

01:24.138 --> 01:25.772
Whoa! Hey!

01:25.806 --> 01:27.107
- Hey!
- Watch where you're going!

01:30.611 --> 01:32.946
- Oh, boy.
- Sorry.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.381
Sorry, my bad.

01:34.415 --> 01:36.049
We thought we were gonna die,

01:36.083 --> 01:38.118
but she was actually really sorry.

01:38.152 --> 01:40.587
So she invited us to a
party at her boss's house,

01:40.621 --> 01:42.222
and they're sending a limo,

01:42.256 --> 01:44.691
and guess who her boss is.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.560
- It's Prince!
- It's Prince!

01:47.595 --> 01:48.995
- It's Prince. It's Prince.
- Prince! It's Prince!

01:49.030 --> 01:51.498
- What? - Oh! Prince?
- Nice!

01:51.532 --> 01:53.767
We're going to a
party at Prince's house,

01:53.801 --> 01:55.669
- We're going to a party...
- We're going...!

01:55.703 --> 01:57.337
...at Prince's house. We're going!

02:00.675 --> 02:02.042
That's not my underwear.

02:12.853 --> 02:15.088
Which shoes should
I wear to Prince's house,

02:15.122 --> 02:16.489
white or black?

02:16.524 --> 02:18.491
White, or black? Nick, come on.

02:18.526 --> 02:19.793
The limo's gonna be here any minute.

02:19.827 --> 02:21.261
Which shoe? White or black?

02:21.295 --> 02:22.495
Well, I think you look
great in everything.

02:22.530 --> 02:23.697
I just want this moment to end.

02:23.731 --> 02:25.031
What are your open-toe options?

02:25.066 --> 02:26.299
None of it works, okay?

02:26.334 --> 02:27.634
We gotta start over. Let's go.

02:27.668 --> 02:28.868
You failed, bro.

02:28.903 --> 02:31.371
Man, I am glad
I'm not going to that party.

02:31.405 --> 02:33.039
Too much pressure, am I right?

02:33.074 --> 02:35.141
Dude, in high school,
going to a Prince party

02:35.176 --> 02:36.343
would've been your dream come true.

02:36.377 --> 02:37.644
You were obsessed.

02:37.678 --> 02:40.146
♪ So tonight we're gonna party

02:40.181 --> 02:44.184
♪ Like it's 1999!

02:44.218 --> 02:46.486
My mother had to cut those
pants off me, they were so tight.

02:51.092 --> 02:52.459
Dearly beloved...

02:52.493 --> 02:55.729
we are gathered here today
to celebrate this thing called...

02:55.763 --> 02:57.163
Schmidt.

02:57.198 --> 02:59.666
- Nick, are you wearing cargo pants?
- Yeah.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.368
You're gonna wear those
to an A-list party?

03:01.402 --> 03:03.570
Hey, guys, how are we going
to transport all this cargo?

03:03.604 --> 03:05.638
Oh, wait, we have Nick's
pants. We're saved.

03:05.673 --> 03:07.073
Get the frickin' pants off.

03:07.108 --> 03:08.708
Dude, we're not going.

03:08.743 --> 03:10.176
Prince invited the hot
girls, not the four dudes.

03:10.211 --> 03:11.544
What?

03:11.579 --> 03:13.179
Why did I buy this $2,000 suit?

03:13.214 --> 03:14.247
You idiot!

03:14.281 --> 03:16.716
Dude, my suit cost $200,

03:16.751 --> 03:18.818
and mine came with socks
stapled to the lapel.

03:18.853 --> 03:20.687
- Not gonna tap that.
- I'm not gonna...

03:20.721 --> 03:22.255
'Cause it came with it.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.423
- Cheap suit.
- Yeah, but it came with socks.

03:23.457 --> 03:24.924
Unacceptable!

03:24.959 --> 03:26.326
This party was supposed to
take me to the next level.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.027
- Next level of what?
- Don't ask, man.

03:28.062 --> 03:29.396
In every man's life,

03:29.430 --> 03:31.197
there is one party
that changes everything.

03:31.232 --> 03:32.365
Oh.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.033
You don't understand.

03:34.068 --> 03:36.035
And that is exactly why
I'm leaving you all behind.

03:36.070 --> 03:38.004
So this whole time, you've just
been waiting for cooler friends?

03:38.038 --> 03:39.672
Yes. Of course.

03:39.707 --> 03:40.907
Coach, look around.

03:40.941 --> 03:42.509
This can't be the finish line.

03:43.377 --> 03:45.178
Here she is.

03:45.212 --> 03:47.514
Whoa!

03:47.548 --> 03:49.182
You look great!

03:50.451 --> 03:51.551
Why is Schmidt dressed up?

03:51.585 --> 03:53.720
I don't want to talk about it.

03:55.456 --> 03:56.589
Prince!

03:56.624 --> 03:57.857
Unbelievable!

03:57.892 --> 03:58.958
Hey, look!

03:58.993 --> 04:00.226
I'm in a limo!

04:00.261 --> 04:02.061
I wish I had really long legs

04:02.096 --> 04:04.297
so I could stretch 'em
out the length of the limo.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.732
Well, have fun.

04:05.766 --> 04:07.333
I love you.

04:14.608 --> 04:16.242
Hmm...

04:16.277 --> 04:17.709
Mm-hmm.

04:17.745 --> 04:19.112
Did Nick just tell me

04:19.146 --> 04:21.314
- he loved me for the first time?
- Yeah.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.649
And did I do finger guns back?

04:22.683 --> 04:23.950
Yeah, you did.

04:23.984 --> 04:25.418
- No...
- Yes.

04:25.453 --> 04:27.220
Oh...

04:27.254 --> 04:29.222
You're gonna want to drink all of this.

04:29.256 --> 04:30.490
- Oh, oh...!
- Hey, driver,

04:30.524 --> 04:31.791
we're gonna need some more champagne!

04:31.826 --> 04:33.460
Ah.

04:33.494 --> 04:34.727
Okay.

04:34.762 --> 04:36.429
So...

04:36.464 --> 04:37.697
Yeah...

04:46.549 --> 04:48.650
Dude, a man never says it first, okay?

04:48.684 --> 04:50.418
Well, it wasn't my plan to tell her,

04:50.452 --> 04:52.854
it just slipped out.
She looked so pretty.

04:52.888 --> 04:54.589
Well, Nick, is that how you
feel? I mean, do you love her?

04:54.623 --> 04:56.324
Of course I do. But I wasn't gonna

04:56.358 --> 04:58.326
say it like that.
I was gonna wait, Winston.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.861
You blurted it out. It's not a big deal.

04:59.895 --> 05:01.129
That's what I always do.

05:03.098 --> 05:06.000
I love you!

05:06.035 --> 05:08.269
Sometimes they say it back,
sometimes they don't...

05:08.304 --> 05:09.704
I mean, it's like a numbers game.

05:09.738 --> 05:11.272
I always do this.

05:11.307 --> 05:12.907
I always get too intent,
and then I freak girls out.

05:12.942 --> 05:14.842
I blew it. What do I do?

05:14.877 --> 05:16.578
Well, Nick, you can't take it back.

05:17.780 --> 05:20.148
Well, that's not 100% true.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.351
Damn! Prince's house!

05:23.385 --> 05:24.419
Not bad, Prince!

05:24.453 --> 05:25.453
You think Prince has a pool?

05:25.487 --> 05:26.521
You think he has a drawbridge?

05:26.555 --> 05:28.890
We're never gonna get in.
We're not even in a limo.

05:28.924 --> 05:30.124
Uh, excuse me, we're in a Ford Fusion,

05:30.159 --> 05:31.359
the best car ever made.

05:31.393 --> 05:32.594
It gets double the gas mileage of...

05:32.628 --> 05:33.795
- Again?
- Shut up.

05:33.829 --> 05:34.762
That's all you've been talking about

05:34.797 --> 05:35.763
the whole drive, and it's weird.

05:35.798 --> 05:37.565
You get sexual when you talk about it.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.566
It's in your eyes. I don't like it.

05:38.601 --> 05:40.768
Double the gas mileage
means you go double as far.

05:40.803 --> 05:42.804
- Double as long.
- Shut up!

05:42.838 --> 05:44.706
I'll let you borrow this,
dude, and you'll feel it.

05:44.740 --> 05:45.907
- You'll know what I'm talking...
- Why don't I feel it right now?

05:45.941 --> 05:48.243
- Feel it.
- Oh, cowabunga!

05:48.277 --> 05:50.044
- You felt it?
- I'm gonna punch you in the face.

05:50.079 --> 05:51.546
Just drive the car.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.147
You've never been turned
on by gas mileage before?

05:53.182 --> 05:55.316
- Never. - No!
- Once.

05:55.351 --> 05:57.785
- When was that?
- It was a Thursday, that's all I remember.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.754
- A Thursday?
- Yeah.

05:59.788 --> 06:01.289
Just drive the car.

06:01.323 --> 06:02.790
I gotta go tell my
girlfriend I don't love her

06:02.825 --> 06:04.058
- so she doesn't leave me.
- All right.

06:04.093 --> 06:05.293
Like a normal person.

06:06.595 --> 06:08.596
Amazing.

06:08.631 --> 06:10.331
Can you believe it?

06:10.366 --> 06:12.066
No, I can't.

06:12.101 --> 06:13.468
Finger guns? That was so stupid.

06:13.502 --> 06:14.902
My brain just froze.

06:14.937 --> 06:16.437
If the limo guy hadn't pulled away,

06:16.472 --> 06:18.273
I probably would've done a lasso.

06:18.307 --> 06:19.941
I think you were just a little scared.

06:19.975 --> 06:21.175
Scared of what?

06:21.210 --> 06:22.443
Saying "I love you"?

06:22.478 --> 06:24.345
I say "I love you" all the time.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.180
I'll say it right now: I love you!

06:26.215 --> 06:27.448
I love you.

06:27.483 --> 06:28.683
Hi, I'm Clayton Kershaw.

06:28.717 --> 06:30.718
I'm a Los Angeles Dodger.

06:30.753 --> 06:32.487
Yeah, and I'm Jessica Day.

06:32.521 --> 06:35.189
I'm a Los Angeles astronaut.

06:37.059 --> 06:38.926
Not now, pal.

06:41.697 --> 06:44.032
- He's never gonna let us in.
- So what do we do?

06:44.066 --> 06:46.034
Pull it together. I need
this as much as you do.

06:46.068 --> 06:48.002
My new life is waiting
for me in that party.

06:48.037 --> 06:49.370
Guys, look, I can't help but think

06:49.405 --> 06:50.805
that now might be a good time

06:50.839 --> 06:52.440
for a little Fire and Ice.

06:52.474 --> 06:53.941
- Oh! Fire and Ice!
- Please, do not... There is never

06:53.976 --> 06:55.777
- a good time for Fire and Ice.
- Yes! Yeah!

06:55.811 --> 06:58.446
Fire and Ice got you
into parties in college,

06:58.480 --> 07:00.014
but it's not getting
you into Prince's house.

07:00.049 --> 07:02.850
Winston, what happens
when you mix fire and ice?

07:02.885 --> 07:03.951
Warm water, baby.

07:07.456 --> 07:09.023
This is embarrassing.

07:10.076 --> 07:11.459
- It's bubbling.
- It's bubbling, baby!

07:11.493 --> 07:12.727
- Warm water!
- Warm water!

07:12.761 --> 07:14.362
- Warm water!
- Warm water!

07:14.396 --> 07:17.465
Um, yeah, I'm on the list.

07:17.499 --> 07:20.635
Ernie!

07:20.669 --> 07:21.736
Winnie?!

07:23.205 --> 07:24.906
Winston L. Bishop.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.208
Ernie, is that really
you? Oh, my goodness!

07:27.242 --> 07:29.577
Come here, man!

07:29.611 --> 07:32.380
My God, it's so good to see you!

07:32.414 --> 07:34.182
This guy saved my life, man.

07:34.216 --> 07:36.684
No, you saved my life.

07:36.719 --> 07:38.019
Let me ask you something, man.

07:38.053 --> 07:39.687
You still keep in contact with Freddy?

07:39.722 --> 07:41.889
Freddy didn't make it.

07:41.924 --> 07:44.392
Freddy's gone?

07:53.135 --> 07:55.069
No! Come on! No! No, man!

07:55.104 --> 07:57.438
- We ain't crying.
- No, you cry, I cry.

07:57.473 --> 07:58.940
This is a great night.

07:58.974 --> 08:00.708
Hope nothing ruins it.

08:01.877 --> 08:03.344
That's nice to see.

08:03.379 --> 08:04.912
Come on, you guys.

08:04.947 --> 08:07.148
For Freddy. For Freddy.

08:14.123 --> 08:15.957
- That's remarkable.
- That worked?

08:15.991 --> 08:17.759
We need our own Fire and Ice, pal.

08:17.793 --> 08:18.926
Well, all right, man.

08:18.961 --> 08:20.495
Ham and Cheese!

08:20.529 --> 08:21.929
I don't really think the name made a...

08:21.964 --> 08:23.297
Ham and Cheese!

08:23.332 --> 08:25.400
- Nick! Well, we should rehearse!
- Excuse me. Excuse me!

08:26.535 --> 08:30.304
- What?! Who's this guy?
- Nick Miller?

08:30.339 --> 08:31.706
- Is that Schmidt?
- You scoundrel, you.

08:33.475 --> 08:35.576
Well, hot damn. Come
here. It's good to see you.

08:35.611 --> 08:37.578
Yeah, well, the feeling's not mutual!

08:37.613 --> 08:39.580
The last time I saw
him, I was on the desert,

08:39.615 --> 08:41.916
and he was putting my
mother into a prison.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.150
You don't understand
what we're doing, do you?

08:43.184 --> 08:45.086
Keep this animal away from me!

08:45.120 --> 08:46.454
You know what? It's my fault.

08:46.488 --> 08:47.722
We didn't rehearse. We didn't rehearse.

08:47.756 --> 08:49.457
Can we come into the party?

08:49.491 --> 08:50.758
You know what? We're
gonna wait back here.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.960
I get it. It's my fault. It's...

08:52.995 --> 08:55.897
- Nick...? - I'm Trojan horsing
inside a bunch of models.

08:55.931 --> 08:56.898
- Every ham for himself.
- No, Nick! Let me in there!

08:56.932 --> 08:58.266
Models, let me in, please.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.935
- No, sir.
- Unhand me!

09:00.969 --> 09:03.371
Jess? Hey, there you are. Excuse me.

09:03.405 --> 09:04.939
- Jess.
- Nick, hi!

09:04.973 --> 09:06.641
What are you doing here?!

09:06.675 --> 09:07.975
- I'm so happy to see you!
- Yeah.

09:08.010 --> 09:09.143
How'd you get in?

09:09.178 --> 09:10.812
- I need to talk to you.
- I know.

09:10.846 --> 09:12.313
I can't leave it the way that was.

09:12.347 --> 09:14.982
I know, because...
there's something, um,

09:15.017 --> 09:16.784
I really should have said back there

09:16.819 --> 09:18.152
and I didn't, and, um...

09:18.187 --> 09:20.021
I think it's important
that I say to you.

09:20.055 --> 09:25.693
So, uh, what I wanted
to say is, Nick Miller...

09:25.727 --> 09:29.697
I...

09:34.236 --> 09:35.536
Jess!

09:35.571 --> 09:36.904
She's all right.

09:38.106 --> 09:39.841
Hey, Jess, you okay?

09:39.875 --> 09:41.976
Hi.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.211
What happened?

09:43.245 --> 09:44.745
You had a panic attack
and you fell down.

09:44.780 --> 09:46.380
Oh, my God...

09:46.415 --> 09:48.683
Which is actually
worse than finger guns.

09:48.717 --> 09:50.218
I didn't think that was possible.

09:50.252 --> 09:51.819
I think it's fair to say

09:51.854 --> 09:53.754
that I did not handle
the situation very well.

09:53.789 --> 09:55.056
No, look, it's fine. In fact,

09:55.090 --> 09:57.024
I want to take the
whole thing back, Jess.

09:57.059 --> 09:58.593
What?

09:58.627 --> 10:00.862
I shouldn't have said it,
it was an accident and, uh...

10:00.896 --> 10:03.931
yeah, so just kind of clear the air.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.602
No! No, Nick!

10:07.636 --> 10:10.104
This just got very awkward.

10:10.138 --> 10:12.039
Be strong, Nick!

10:12.074 --> 10:12.974
What did...?

10:13.008 --> 10:13.975
What...?

10:14.009 --> 10:14.909
- What's that?
- I'm outside the hedge!

10:14.943 --> 10:16.310
You see my arm?

10:16.345 --> 10:17.945
I'm trying to push through!

10:17.980 --> 10:19.747
What are you doing up there?

10:19.781 --> 10:20.548
Be careful!

10:20.582 --> 10:21.549
I lost my bearings!

10:21.583 --> 10:23.251
I had to go high to avoid the spiders!

10:23.285 --> 10:25.453
- Nick...
- Just wait for him to finish.

10:25.487 --> 10:26.854
I'm breaching!

10:26.889 --> 10:28.222
- Uh...
- Whoa!

10:28.257 --> 10:29.423
Easy! Easy! Aah! Aah!

10:29.458 --> 10:30.591
Oh!

10:33.762 --> 10:35.396
Prince is terrible at Frisbee.

10:35.430 --> 10:37.265
There's, like, ten of
these things up there.

10:37.299 --> 10:39.467
Hey, guys, can I talk to
Nick alone for a second?

10:39.501 --> 10:40.134
You got it.

10:40.168 --> 10:42.169
Yeah.

10:43.071 --> 10:44.939
You're taking it back?

10:44.973 --> 10:46.574
Is that how you really feel?

10:46.608 --> 10:48.409
Well...

10:48.443 --> 10:50.912
how do you feel?

10:52.447 --> 10:53.948
Hi.

10:55.918 --> 10:57.919
I'm Prince.

10:57.953 --> 11:00.321
So what seems to be the problem?

11:03.077 --> 11:04.258
Oh, how rude of me.

11:04.293 --> 11:06.794
I haven't given you enough
time to freak out yet.

11:06.828 --> 11:08.930
You may do so now.

11:08.964 --> 11:11.032
Oh, my God!

11:13.468 --> 11:14.669
Oh, my God!

11:18.607 --> 11:20.708
Oh, my God! Nick!

11:35.352 --> 11:37.653
So, I'm not familiar with
this term "finger guns."

11:37.688 --> 11:38.487
Can you elaborate?

11:38.522 --> 11:41.424
Uh, yeah, it's a...

11:41.458 --> 11:43.993
Whoa. Don't point those
at me. They might go off.

11:45.529 --> 11:48.331
That was very much of
your flavor of humor.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.267
Listen, Nick, uh...

11:51.301 --> 11:52.768
Nick, right?

11:52.803 --> 11:53.803
Yes, that's my name.

11:53.837 --> 11:55.671
Jess and I are gonna take a moment

11:55.706 --> 11:57.139
to just be alone.

11:59.142 --> 12:00.776
I'm-I'm not worried, but why?

12:00.811 --> 12:03.179
What are you gonna talk to her about?

12:03.213 --> 12:04.146
You.

12:05.482 --> 12:09.318
Nick, I never thought
I'd say this, but...

12:09.353 --> 12:11.787
I need to be alone with Prince.

12:11.822 --> 12:14.624
All right, well...

12:14.658 --> 12:15.891
Yeah.

12:25.402 --> 12:28.204
So, do you like pancakes?

12:34.711 --> 12:37.013
Ooh, ooh.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.384
Cece, help! The bouncer's after me.

12:41.418 --> 12:43.686
Oh, all right. Okay.

12:51.762 --> 12:53.729
He's gone.

12:53.764 --> 12:55.064
He's gone, Schmidt.

12:55.098 --> 12:56.832
- Is he gone?
- Mm-hmm.

12:59.336 --> 13:00.970
You can stop now.

13:01.004 --> 13:04.006
He's tenacious. He's
definitely gonna be back.

13:04.041 --> 13:07.977
Pretty sure it's all clear.

13:08.011 --> 13:11.314
It's always good to see old friends.

13:11.348 --> 13:12.548
Thank you.

13:16.620 --> 13:20.089
So, tonight's the night we're
just gonna leave this all behind

13:20.123 --> 13:23.025
and get cooler friends, right?

13:24.761 --> 13:27.029
Yeah, right.

13:27.064 --> 13:30.433
We should be dead.
We should be dead.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.435
I never thought I was
gonna see him again!

13:33.804 --> 13:36.572
He's getting emotional right
now, because this is real.

13:36.606 --> 13:38.908
Oh, if you cry, I'm gonna cry.

13:38.942 --> 13:41.077
And then I'm gonna cry, then
we can just cry together.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.345
Poor Freddy.

13:42.379 --> 13:44.180
Jess is with Prince!
And I've been drinking.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.682
Wait... Jess is with Prince?

13:46.717 --> 13:49.052
And I've been drinking.
Who are these two?

13:49.200 --> 13:50.886
Come on, man.
Fire and Ice, dude. Get out.

13:50.921 --> 13:53.089
- It's getting warm in here isn't it?
- Yes.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.623
It's actually a little chilly. We're...

13:54.658 --> 13:56.592
Oh, give me a break.
I see what you're doing.

13:56.626 --> 13:57.593
Mm-mm.

13:57.627 --> 13:58.794
You're trying to tempt me sexually.

13:58.829 --> 13:59.428
Not interested.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.796
What are you doing, Nick?

14:00.831 --> 14:02.598
That leads to me taking my jacket off,

14:02.632 --> 14:05.534
and all of a sudden, you guys
got me in my underwear, huh?

14:05.569 --> 14:08.237
I'm not a dummy. Take a walk.
No one's interested.

14:08.271 --> 14:09.805
- So rude. How idiotic.
- We got business. Rude?

14:09.840 --> 14:11.140
No, no, no, no, no,
no, stay, stay, stay.

14:11.174 --> 14:12.208
- Let's go.
- Idiot!

14:12.242 --> 14:13.275
Yeah, I'm an idiot.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.577
- Ciao.
- No, no, no ciao!

14:14.611 --> 14:15.644
No ciao.

14:15.679 --> 14:16.746
You'll be replaced by robots

14:16.780 --> 14:18.280
before you can say,

14:18.315 --> 14:20.649
"Fragi-cava-licious."

14:20.684 --> 14:22.385
You're bringing Fire
and Ice down! Yeah, man.

14:22.419 --> 14:23.919
You don't bring Fire and Ice down.

14:23.954 --> 14:24.970
Don't start with me right now.

14:25.069 --> 14:27.123
I'm having a terrible day.
Who cares about them?

14:27.157 --> 14:28.157
Who cares? I care!

14:28.191 --> 14:30.226
I feel like dancing right now.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.394
Dancing's not the answer.

14:31.428 --> 14:32.661
You can't dance.

14:32.696 --> 14:34.230
It's only gonna get worse.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.232
Let's tear the roof off this joint,

14:36.266 --> 14:39.201
and show Prince how we do!

14:43.473 --> 14:45.174
Thanks, Charles.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.575
You want to know why

14:46.610 --> 14:48.511
you can't tell that
nice dude you love him?

14:48.545 --> 14:49.812
I want to say it, but...

14:49.846 --> 14:50.813
You're scared.

14:50.847 --> 14:52.181
Exactly.

14:52.215 --> 14:53.482
If you say it and things

14:53.517 --> 14:54.950
don't work out, what then?

14:54.985 --> 14:56.352
I really care for him.

14:56.386 --> 14:57.620
And I'm just worried

14:57.654 --> 14:58.788
I'm gonna lose him.

14:58.822 --> 14:59.588
That's stupid.

14:59.623 --> 15:01.657
You're stupid.

15:06.730 --> 15:07.863
I forgive you.

15:07.898 --> 15:09.632
- Oh, my God, thank God!
- Besides...

15:09.666 --> 15:13.002
anything beautiful
is worth getting hurt for.

15:13.036 --> 15:14.136
Well, that's very well put.

15:14.171 --> 15:15.204
You know who said that?

15:15.238 --> 15:16.038
No.

15:17.641 --> 15:19.375
Me.

15:19.409 --> 15:21.677
You're good. God.

15:21.711 --> 15:25.448
I wish I were more like you, Prince.

15:25.482 --> 15:27.349
Finish your pancake.

15:27.384 --> 15:28.818
Let's get to work.

15:28.852 --> 15:30.019
Oh, it's really good.

15:30.053 --> 15:31.620
But I'm super full.

15:31.655 --> 15:33.055
- Pancake.
- Okay.

15:34.825 --> 15:36.158
Here, put this on.

15:36.193 --> 15:37.493
Oh, that's beautiful,

15:37.527 --> 15:38.727
but I don't think I could pull that off.

15:38.762 --> 15:39.695
Don't argue with me.

15:39.729 --> 15:40.830
Okay.

15:52.843 --> 15:54.009
Repeat after me.

15:54.044 --> 15:55.711
- Love.
- Love.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.083
- Love.
- Love.

16:02.519 --> 16:04.253
14-zero. My lead.

16:04.287 --> 16:06.856
What am I supposed to be learning here?

16:06.890 --> 16:08.390
15-zero.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.725
- Love.
- Love.

16:09.759 --> 16:11.060
- Love.
- Love.

16:11.094 --> 16:12.695
You're not saying it right.

16:12.729 --> 16:14.830
Do you understand now?

16:14.865 --> 16:17.266
Yes, I think I do.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.208
What about now?

16:26.243 --> 16:27.543
No.

16:28.945 --> 16:30.012
No.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.016
Look in there.

16:35.785 --> 16:38.053
Wait, stop, no! I'm afraid of the dark!

16:42.325 --> 16:44.994
I said stop being afraid.

16:47.731 --> 16:49.064
Boo.

16:53.494 --> 16:54.862
Yeah! This is what sexy is!

16:56.931 --> 16:59.399
So, what do you think?

16:59.434 --> 17:01.435
I think you need to go find Nick.

17:02.537 --> 17:04.070
I don't know how to thank you.

17:04.105 --> 17:06.039
Shh.

17:11.546 --> 17:13.814
I honestly didn't hear a word you said.

17:13.848 --> 17:16.282
Okay.

17:17.352 --> 17:19.453
Okay, gotcha.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.124
This is your party now.

17:27.161 --> 17:28.595
- To the VIP room?
- Yeah.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.197
With the two of you?

17:30.231 --> 17:32.866
You can't handle it!

17:32.901 --> 17:34.701
You can't beat me!

17:37.338 --> 17:38.338
Come on. You've got it.

17:38.373 --> 17:39.306
Boy, you don't got it.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.073
You can't do it.

17:40.108 --> 17:41.074
- You're gonna do it.
- Three...

17:41.109 --> 17:42.576
- You can't do it. Two...
- He's gonna do it!

17:42.610 --> 17:43.844
Come on, now, you can get it.

17:43.878 --> 17:45.012
Winnie, don't give up.

17:45.046 --> 17:47.147
- What?
- Damn it.

17:47.181 --> 17:49.349
- That's impressive.
- New record.

17:49.384 --> 17:51.485
Surrounded by celebrities
and millionaires,

17:51.519 --> 17:53.787
and you dingbats are
playing Lemon Mouth.

17:55.556 --> 17:57.324
Rind me, woman.

17:57.358 --> 17:58.859

17:58.893 --> 17:59.993
- Let's do it.
- All right, let's go.

18:00.028 --> 18:01.461
Let's get this party started.

18:01.496 --> 18:03.397
- You got the time, Winston. Check this out.

18:03.431 --> 18:04.498
Here we go:

18:04.532 --> 18:07.234
Ten, nine,

18:07.268 --> 18:08.602
- What are you doing?

18:08.636 --> 18:09.603
What are you doing?

18:09.637 --> 18:10.837
Boom!

18:10.872 --> 18:13.373
- What?!
- You're not supposed to eat the lemon.

18:13.408 --> 18:14.408
New record.

18:14.442 --> 18:16.343
That's not even the game!

18:31.225 --> 18:33.226
Nick Miller!

18:41.035 --> 18:43.637
Hey, Jess.

18:43.671 --> 18:46.006
I'm not sorry that I said it.

18:51.579 --> 18:53.313
I hate to say this,
but I couldn't hear you

18:53.348 --> 18:54.314
'cause it's very loud.

18:54.349 --> 18:56.450
I love you!

18:56.484 --> 18:58.118
I love you, Nick Miller!

19:05.593 --> 19:07.828
What the hell are you wearing?

19:07.862 --> 19:09.062

19:09.097 --> 19:10.230
Awesome!

19:10.264 --> 19:10.998
