WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:04.296
Get on the ground. Wallet and phone!

00:05.923 --> 00:07.174
You weren't there!

00:07.174 --> 00:09.593
You don't know the shit I went through.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.595
The same thing that happened to you

00:11.595 --> 00:13.054
happened to me.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.932
Are you sure the two of us working

00:14.932 --> 00:16.767
so closely together is a good idea?

00:16.767 --> 00:18.352
<i>It might get complicated.</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:20.020
It's not fair that my reputation

00:20.020 --> 00:22.439
in this firm takes a hit when you were the one--

00:22.439 --> 00:23.816
I was the one that what?

00:23.816 --> 00:26.109
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.236
If you must know, I overslept.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.489
I'd love to go out again. Is tonight too soon?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.533
Let me check my calendar-- Yep, I'm free.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.827
I have an idea. If we work together for a year,

00:34.827 --> 00:37.830
and it's successful, you'll be on the junior partner track.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.373
That sounds like a plan.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.917
Harvey, this is Thomas-- Kessler, we've met.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.385
There's another one. Oh.

00:51.385 --> 00:55.222
Your grandmother did not wanna go to the beach in Nice,

00:55.222 --> 00:57.224
but I insisted.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.935
Oh, my God. Mom, you were hot.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.646
Donna, please. I was smoking hot.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.816
Well, if you got it, admit it.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.360
Sweetie, I really appreciate you indulging me.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.071
It's always nice to look back at this trip,

01:11.071 --> 01:13.448
but it's just so much more fun with you.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.660
I'm not indulging you, Mom. I love it too.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.998
Then what do you say we make an album of our own?

01:20.998 --> 01:23.083
What do you mean? The last few years

01:23.083 --> 01:25.252
have been tight, but I've been saving up.

01:25.252 --> 01:29.590
And you and I are going to Paris for two weeks

01:29.590 --> 01:31.258
right after you graduate.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.219
You're kidding. I am 100 percent not kidding.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.971
Mom, this is amazing.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.347
I wanna see it all.

01:37.347 --> 01:40.434
Notre-Dame, the Louvre, the cafés.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.436
Do you really think we can do all that?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.938
We can do anything you want.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.856
Because I finally understand

01:45.856 --> 01:49.192
why that trip was so special for my mom.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.070
And now I get to have all that with you.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.617
Okay, just the way you like it.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.869
Vanilla with two splashes of "Why would anyone

01:58.869 --> 02:00.328
want their coffee this sweet?"

02:00.328 --> 02:02.664
You seem particularly happy this morning.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.750
I am. Any reason?

02:04.750 --> 02:06.293
Other than the fact you woke up

02:06.293 --> 02:09.170
next to this 5

02:10.255 --> 02:11.799
As a matter of fact, there is.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.717
Um, do you remember that meeting

02:13.717 --> 02:15.761
I had to leave early for the other day?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.387
You mean after our first time,

02:17.387 --> 02:19.556
when you snuck out like you robbed a bank?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.266
You know, funny you should say that,

02:21.266 --> 02:24.185
because I feel like I robbed a bank this morning.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.229
What do you mean?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.399
Well, we've been negotiating

02:29.399 --> 02:31.068
to expand our retail presence.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.195
We were at an impasse, and now...

02:34.195 --> 02:35.405
we're full steam ahead.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.365
Thomas, that's fantastic. It is.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.327
It's gonna take us to a whole other level.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.079
But the real reason I'm so happy

02:42.079 --> 02:43.831
is that there isn't anyone

02:43.831 --> 02:46.333
I'd rather share this with than you.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.170
There he is. The man himself.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.548
The Babe Ruth of the legal profession.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.592
Flatter me all you want, Simon.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.720
You got me over here at 8, and I don't like to be up at 8.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.097
So, what do you got?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.807
The answer to our tenant problems.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.476
I assume you mean Restoration pulling out of the deal.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.354
I do. I've invited someone else to take their seat.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.024
Who's that? Thomas Kessler Furniture.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.776
They're up-and-coming. They're about to sign a huge deal

03:12.776 --> 03:16.363
with my major competitor, and I want them.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.490
You gotta be kidding me. There a problem?

03:18.490 --> 03:22.870
Simon, aside from the fact that we represent Kessler,

03:22.870 --> 03:25.080
which is a conflict, I can get Restoration

03:25.080 --> 03:27.290
back to the table.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.250
I don't want them back at the table.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.461
But I thought we-- Harvey, think about it.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.506
They're a national chain, and they're flush with cash.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.591
And we can only build so many malls.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.511
If we're gonna increase our revenue going forward--

03:39.511 --> 03:41.262
You need up-and-coming tenants

03:41.262 --> 03:43.348
who will trade a piece of the upside

03:43.348 --> 03:44.349
for a break on rent.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.851
Welcome to the conversation.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.936
Okay, Simon.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.605
Yet I still feel you're checking your swing.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.816
So, what's your concern?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.193
No concern.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.862
You want Kessler, you got him.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.199
Louis, this is so much fun.

04:00.199 --> 04:03.077
I'm so glad

04:00.199 --> 04:03.077
we're finally doing this.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.578
Of course. When I told you that

04:04.578 --> 04:06.955
our baby comes first, I meant it.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.457
And speaking of coming first...

04:09.457 --> 04:11.168
Imagine our little love bug rolling

04:11.168 --> 04:12.836
to the playground in this bad boy.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.171
Wait. Is this

04:14.171 --> 04:16.215
Yep.<i> Paternity Magazine's</i> top pick.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.884
It is also $2,000.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.136
Can we really ask people to buy this for us?

04:21.136 --> 04:24.639
Let me explain something to you. All of our friends are rich.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.266
As any rich person will tell you,

04:26.266 --> 04:28.185
gifts are the truest form of love.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.395
So, in other words, scan that mofo.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.522
Scan the shit out of that bad boy.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.111
Hello

04:37.111 --> 04:38.278
Yeah, this is.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.654
This is Detective Bukowski.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.322
Was your wallet stolen recently?

04:42.908 --> 04:45.535
Yeah. It was. How could you possibly know

04:45.535 --> 04:48.163
We believe we just arrested the man who stole it.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.582
Oh, my God.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.292
Would you be willing to come here

04:52.292 --> 04:54.544
and identify him in a lineup?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.504
Sir, I can assure you, he won't see you.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.132
He won't even know who you are.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.591
Yeah, I'll come right down.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.384
Just let me know where you're at.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.971
Thanks.

If you see the man who mugged you, just let me know.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.030
Get on the ground and don't you fucking look at me.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.739
Mr. Litt, do you recognize anyone?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.033
Number six.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.827
Number six, step forward.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.169
Are you sure? We need you to be sure.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.628
Wallet and phone.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.130
It's him. I'm sure.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.091
Good. We appreciate the cooperation.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.552
The DA's office will be in touch about testifying.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.096
Testify? I thought I just had to identify him.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.764
You also said you were assaulted.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.766
Unless you wanna let him plead to a misdemeanor,

06:31.766 --> 06:33.227
you need to appear in court.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.437
Yeah, of course.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.106
Take the rest of them out.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.028
Alex, you got a second?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.822
I'm running a two-minute drill right now, so, no.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.200
Well, I need you to take a look at this anyway.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.285
What is it?

06:50.285 --> 06:52.287
Simon Lowe wants Thomas Kessler

06:52.287 --> 06:54.081
to be their anchor in 20 new malls.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.624
Well, I'm sorry to say that's my two-minute drill.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.834
I'm at the one-yard line

06:57.834 --> 06:59.794
with another mall owner. So?

06:59.794 --> 07:02.047
He doesn't like to deal in bad faith.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.422
This isn't bad faith, Alex.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.424
He didn't even know this deal was coming.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.886
He sure as hell didn't know how good it would be.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.804
Good or not, it's a conflict.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.016
Look at the offer, then tell me he won't waive conflict.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.272
Damn. A 50 percent haircut on a rent

07:18.272 --> 07:19.981
for 10 percent of our gross?

07:19.981 --> 07:23.318
These guys are serious. Beats whatever you got cooking.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.280
How'd you come up with this? I didn't. My client did.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.782
I been busting my ass for months on this,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.742
and your client comes to you with this.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.452
Shit falls out of the sky for you.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.579
You don't wanna know how high school was.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.623
No, sir, I do not.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.125
All right, I'll take it to him.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.127
But we better get them in a room fast.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.836
Thomas won't pull out of his deal

07:41.836 --> 07:44.881
without looking Simon in the eye and seeing he's for real.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.593
You wanted to see me?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.970
Yes.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.805
In fact, I have a present for you.

07:51.805 --> 07:56.268
Your first client. I don't understand.

07:56.268 --> 07:59.020
If we're going to follow through on you being promoted

07:59.020 --> 08:02.523
and working on your own, we need to do this. Right?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.693
You're right. Who's the client?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.237
Bespoke Handbags.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.114
Landlord found out they use ammonia.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.991
They never disclosed it. They're being

08:10.991 --> 08:12.826
kicked out of the building. Bullshit.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.454
This is just a ploy because they found a new tenant.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.538
What are you gonna do? Because they have us

08:17.538 --> 08:19.540
on a technicality, and they know it.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.669
I'm gonna figure out who the new tenant is and try to stop it.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.545
Proving yourself worthy of this client.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.881
There are thousands of potential tenants.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.758
How am I gonna figure out who it is?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.677
That, good sir, is your problem.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.431
No, it isn't. It's ours.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.475
Brian, the whole point of this was--

08:36.475 --> 08:37.684
Hear me out.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.644
Remember that algorithm you used

08:39.644 --> 08:42.647
to determine who should stay and who should be fired?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.191
Of course. PATTIE.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.151
Well, if you could use it for that...

08:46.151 --> 08:48.945
I can alter it for this.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.032
Okay. Though you realize this means we're working together.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.742
With one key difference. You're working for me.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.536
And I don't tolerate slackers.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.579
So have that shit ready by 10 tomorrow.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.457
I got a case to win.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.171
Donna.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.299
Harvey. I wanna talk about last night.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.718
You mean LeBron's game winner against the Knicks?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.720
You know what I mean.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.306
I wanna talk to you about me seeing Thomas.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.976
And the truth is, I told Louis, and I meant to tell you--

09:19.976 --> 09:23.230
You don't have to tell me every time you start seeing a client.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.482
That's the thing. I don't just wanna tell you

09:25.482 --> 09:27.567
because he's a client. I wanted to tell you

09:27.567 --> 09:30.611
because even though it's really early on, I...

09:30.611 --> 09:32.113
I really like him.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.283
Donna, if you really like him, I am happy for you.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.369
You're never gonna believe this, but...

09:38.786 --> 09:40.747
I got a proposal for him from Simon Lowe.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.208
They want him to be their home goods anchor.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.627
Well, that's incredible, but-- The other deal, I know.

09:46.627 --> 09:50.298
I spoke to Alex about it, and he agreed this one's better,

09:50.298 --> 09:52.509
and we set up a meeting for them tonight.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.094
Thank you, Harvey.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.930
I wish I could take credit for it, but it wasn't my idea.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.600
No. I mean, thank you for understanding.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.978
And as far as the deal goes, credit or not,

10:03.978 --> 10:06.440
Thomas' business means everything to him.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.900
So I really appreciate it.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.612
All right, I got a situation.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.323
I need to talk to you about it. What kind of situation?

10:15.323 --> 10:17.825
That scumbag who mugged me? They just arrested him,

10:17.825 --> 10:20.287
called me down to ID him, but that wasn't enough.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.913
They want me to get on the stand

10:21.913 --> 10:23.373
and point the finger at him.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.875
You want me to go with you? I want you to tell me

10:25.875 --> 10:27.168
that it's okay not to go.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.087
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.005
Why the hell not? Because.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.925
I get that you're scared, but if you don't take the stand,

10:33.925 --> 10:36.636
no amount of self-defense is gonna take that fear away.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.805
The only thing that can is confronting him.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.723
You don't understand. When I saw him,

10:40.723 --> 10:42.225
I was right back in that alley.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.603
Trust me, no one gets that more than me.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.980
But I promise, if you do this,

10:46.980 --> 10:50.150
I will be with you every step of the way.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.782
HARVEY: Alex, this is Simon Lowe.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.993
And, of course, Simon... Thomas Kessler.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.036
I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.288
I recognize that table.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.165
And I hope to have more just like that

11:05.165 --> 11:06.916
anchoring my malls. Shall we?

11:06.916 --> 11:10.211
Look, I won't lie, I'm intrigued by your offer,

11:10.211 --> 11:13.840
but you're asking me to back out of a deal at the eleventh hour.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.842
I need to know I'm not just a backup plan.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.760
SIMON: Well, then

11:15.842 --> 11:17.760
I won't lie either.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.847
If another deal hadn't run into trouble, you wouldn't be here.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.932
There were 15 companies I could've gone to

11:22.932 --> 11:25.602
that weren't about to close a deal with someone else,

11:25.602 --> 11:28.104
but I chose you, 'cause I believe in you.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.815
I don't take your relationship with our firm lightly.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.276
Believe me when I tell you this is a good offer,

11:33.276 --> 11:35.570
and I stand behind it.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.572
Then I'd say we have ourselves a deal.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.450
With one stipulation. When my client commits, he commits.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.619
We need to know you're gonna follow through.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.038
We had a feeling you'd say something like that,

11:45.038 --> 11:47.832
which is why we're prepared to issue a press release

11:47.832 --> 11:49.959
tomorrow morning announcing the whole thing.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.795
You would do that

11:52.795 --> 11:54.839
Well, that stuff's for the lawyers, huh?

11:54.839 --> 11:56.090
We're businessmen.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.218
And if you're who I think you are,

11:58.218 --> 12:00.637
a handshake is enough for me.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.896
Let's try this again.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.898
What happened that night?

12:13.274 --> 12:16.735
He pulled a gun on me, forced me into the alley,

12:16.735 --> 12:19.780
then stole my wallet and my phone.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.449
Did he hurt you?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.451
Yes. The assailant hurt me.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.786
Louis, we have been over this.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.331
Facts don't affect juries the way feelings do.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.709
You have to share your pain with them.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.293
I can't. I know you think that--

12:32.293 --> 12:34.795
You don't know. You've never had to let someone see

12:34.795 --> 12:37.048
what he did to you. How he made you helpless

12:37.048 --> 12:38.675
and scared like a child.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.595
Have you ever asked one of your clients to hide their pain?

12:41.595 --> 12:42.929
Of course not, this is different.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.847
Only difference is you're the client.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.765
Goddamn it, don't you think I know that?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.727
All right, that's enough.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.271
Look at me. If you don't put him away,

12:51.271 --> 12:54.107
he will haunt you for the rest of your life.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.692
You are doing this

12:55.692 --> 12:57.818
so you won't ever have to be afraid again.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.905
So do not be afraid of your emotions now.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.871
When he pointed the gun at me...

13:11.750 --> 13:13.710
it was...

13:13.710 --> 13:16.795
I'd never been more afraid in my life.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.215
And then he forced me into the alley.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.510
And then he made me get on the ground.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.555
Then he pressed the gun in the back of my head.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.558
He demanded my wallet and my phone.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.852
But I only gave him my wallet, because my phone had--

13:31.852 --> 13:35.315
--pictures of my fiancée on it.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.024
So, I--

13:39.110 --> 13:40.945
I begged him to let me keep it.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.115
I mean, there was $1,000 in the wallet.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.200
Wasn't that enough?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.496
But he said that he would say when it was enough.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.207
Then he kicked me. And all I could think about

13:53.207 --> 13:55.543
was the woman I love and the baby we'd never have

13:55.543 --> 13:57.504
because I was gonna die in that alley.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.506
Mr. Litt, is the man who did that to you

13:59.506 --> 14:00.715
in this room right now?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.092
Yeah, he's sitting right there.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.721
Thank you, Mr. Litt.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.348
Your cross.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.890
We have no need to cross,

14:09.890 --> 14:12.811
because everything Mr. Litt just said is irrelevant.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.187
What?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.772
DEFENDER: The date on the warrant

14:15.772 --> 14:17.691
doesn't match the date of the search,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.776
therefore, all evidence against my client

14:19.776 --> 14:21.194
is inadmissible.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.987
I move for charges to be dismissed.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.781
What? You can't do that. He's guilty.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.366
JUDGE: Mr. Litt, I'm sorry.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.867
The search was illegal.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.911
By order of the court, the defendant is free to go.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.293
Harvey, I gotta say,

14:37.293 --> 14:39.671
that was an impressive display last night.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.422
HARVEY: Damn straight it was.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.008
Listen, you get the paperwork I sent over this morning?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.553
SIMON: <i>Yeah, I did. I hate to waste</i>

14:44.008 --> 14:46.553
<i>everyone's time,</i>

14:46.553 --> 14:49.263
<i>but I won't be signing it.</i> Why the hell not?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.559
Well, it turns out Restoration came back to the table.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.228
When exactly did that happen?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.271
SIMON: <i>About an hour ago.</i>

14:57.271 --> 15:00.149
Simon, I'm only gonna ask you this once.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.693
Was this whole thing designed

15:01.693 --> 15:03.778
to get Restoration back to the table?

15:03.778 --> 15:05.697
It was designed to either get them back

15:05.697 --> 15:07.657
or to take a chance on an up-and-comer.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.950
Either way, my malls don't sit empty.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.953
Simon, you said you were doing this deal.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.373
You used me to help sell him on it.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.584
Then you shook his hand and lied to his face.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.336
I said what I needed to to make a deal happen.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.130
I don't need to justify myself to my own goddamn lawyer.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.758
<i>Now, this is happening.</i>

15:24.758 --> 15:26.384
<i>And I need Restoration</i> <i>to think</i>

15:26.384 --> 15:28.010
that the Thomas deal is still on.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.929
I know how negotiations work, Simon.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.472
And I know how privilege works,

15:31.472 --> 15:33.140
so if you tell anyone about this,

15:33.140 --> 15:35.351
be it Thomas or Alex or the queen of England,

15:35.351 --> 15:37.228
<i>we'll be done.</i>

15:40.899 --> 15:43.860
All right, that should be the last variable.

15:43.860 --> 15:47.113
What's it say? Hold on, it's calculating.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.283
Goddamn it. It only narrowed the list down to 800.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.578
Well, that's a lot lower than what we started with.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.704
So, maybe we can--

15:54.704 --> 15:56.831
What, get it down to 300?

15:56.831 --> 15:59.459
What difference will it make? We have less than a day.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.669
What do you want me to say? It was an idea.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.922
I didn't know the program wouldn't work.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.633
I know, Brian. I'm sorry. I'm just...

16:08.426 --> 16:09.803
Wait a second.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
The program didn't work this time,

16:11.805 --> 16:14.974
but the program didn't work last time either.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.811
It said other people were more valuable than you.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.896
While I love being reminded of that,

16:19.896 --> 16:22.398
I don't see how-- Think about it. PATTIE was wrong

16:22.398 --> 16:25.025
because she didn't take into account your intangibles.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.861
I had to be convinced to keep you.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.071
We need to convince that property owner

16:29.071 --> 16:31.240
that our client is more valuable

16:31.240 --> 16:33.534
than whoever they wanna replace us with.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.286
Exactly.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.248
Samantha, whatever it is--

16:39.248 --> 16:41.167
I wanna talk about what happened today.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.586
Doesn't matter what happened because it's over.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.797
I'm here because it doesn't have to be.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.049
You No. I'm not breaking the law.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.426
Louis, he assaulted you.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.178
You cannot let him get away with it.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.806
He did get away with it, Samantha.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.599
He walked away.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.434
And now I'm gonna do the same thing.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.938
Don't you get it? You can't do that. Not with him out there.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.859
Damn it, you don't think I know how dangerous he is?

17:05.859 --> 17:08.862
He fucking knows where I live. I'm not gonna risk it.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.279
Louis, he's a bully.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.365
Bullies only have power if you let them.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.283
No. Bullies only have power

17:14.283 --> 17:15.910
because they have guns and knives

17:15.910 --> 17:17.620
and nothing to lose, but I do.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.164
The only reason that criminal knows I have a family

17:20.164 --> 17:22.166
because I let you convince me to do this.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.793
I'm not making that mistake again.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.461
What I'm gonna do is let it go,

17:25.461 --> 17:27.630
and I don't wanna hear another word about it.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.470
Harvey, what's the story

17:34.470 --> 17:36.681
We can talk about the deal in a minute.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.224
I need to ask you something.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.226
It's hypothetical, but

17:40.226 --> 17:43.479
You got two clients, both in a deal together.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.815
One bills seven figures, the other five.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.067
They both waive conflict, then you find out

17:48.067 --> 17:50.820
the big one is planning to screw over the little one.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.531
Son of a bitch. This isn't hypothetical.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.449
This is Simon Lowe and Thomas Kessler.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.536
Answer the question. You stick with the bigger fish.

17:58.536 --> 18:01.247
Doesn't matter who's bigger. You can't break privilege.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.957
I know. Why are you telling me?

18:02.957 --> 18:05.668
Because I don't like it. We may not have to tell Thomas,

18:05.668 --> 18:08.337
but that doesn't mean we can't do something about it.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.839
Since I'm not supposed to know,

18:09.839 --> 18:11.632
you're not supposed to undercut your client,

18:11.632 --> 18:13.051
what are we supposed to do?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.427
Simon will stick with Thomas

18:14.427 --> 18:16.054
if Restoration falls out again.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.347
So we're gonna make that happen. Are you crazy?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.641
In what world does that not get back to Simon?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.810
One where I can get someone to do it for us.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.479
Then what do you need me for? The backup plan.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.607
Which is to get Thomas' original landlord

18:27.607 --> 18:28.775
to beat Simon's deal.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.443
They won't even take my call.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.486
One of us is gonna get this thing done.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.114
But we don't have much time. So are you in or out?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.102
I can get to you anytime.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.606
No. No.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.459
I'm in.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.921
Are you sure? I'm sure.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.173
Just tell me what I have to do. Nothing.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.134
Consider the matter handled.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.677
What How are you gonna

19:37.677 --> 19:39.846
Louis, just let me do what I do.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.389
No. I'm not gonna just sit on the sidelines.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.599
I wanna be a part of it.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.601
That's not a good idea. Samantha,

19:45.601 --> 19:48.354
I'm not gonna live in fear my whole life. You said it.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.149
The only way that's gonna happen is if I stand up to him.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.400
Then be prepared to testify again.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.945
I have a feeling new evidence is gonna come to light

19:55.945 --> 19:58.114
that links him to that mugging.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.657
I'll be ready.

20:01.075 --> 20:03.661
Damn it, I don't care if your firm has conflict.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.372
I need this.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.999
Yeah? Well, I'll remember that

20:07.999 --> 20:10.793
the next time you come to me for a favor.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.337
Harvey?

20:13.337 --> 20:15.173
Do you have a second?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.008
Of course, Donna. What do you need?

20:17.008 --> 20:18.676
Well, it's just...

20:18.676 --> 20:20.678
Thomas is so excited about this deal,

20:20.678 --> 20:22.429
I wanna take him out to celebrate.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.141
I'm wondering, do you think it's gonna close tonight

20:25.141 --> 20:27.560
or tomorrow night? It won't be tonight.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.021
We still need to get approval from Simon's board.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.481
Wouldn't they approve it before approaching him?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.983
Well, they did, in concept.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.819
Now they just need to approve the actual deal,

20:36.819 --> 20:38.278
which takes a beat.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.906
I get it.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.699
This is about Elaine Phillips.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.368
She's in Norway, you don't know when she'll be back,

20:44.368 --> 20:47.329
and you don't want me to have to keep this from Thomas.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.915
That's right. You got me.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.084
No. Harvey.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.086
There is no Elaine Phillips.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.921
When I asked about this deal closing,

20:54.921 --> 20:56.756
you got a look on your face. I wanna know why.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.632
We are not having this conversation.

20:58.632 --> 21:02.428
Yes, we are. I can't make sense of why you're acting like this

21:02.428 --> 21:04.471
other than Thomas' deal is in trouble.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.390
I'm not gonna tell you what's going on.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.975
And I'm not leaving till you do.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.852
If I do leave, I'm just gonna call him

21:09.852 --> 21:12.855
and tell him that something's going on. So--

21:12.855 --> 21:15.775
Okay. Pfft. You know what?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.569
All right, you wanna know?

21:19.820 --> 21:22.281
Simon was using Thomas as a stalking horse.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.701
I don't believe this.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.786
Donna, we can fix it.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.454
Fix it? There is no fixing it.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.082
Thomas isn't gonna want to be in business with Simon

21:31.082 --> 21:33.167
when he finds out. No matter what you do.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.835
He's not gonna find out about it.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.546
Because if we tell him, we've betrayed our other client.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.340
What about this client? I'll tell you about this client.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.884
I went to Alex to get us out of this.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.137
He's gonna try and get Thomas' original mall owner

21:44.137 --> 21:46.472
to sweeten the deal. And what are you gonna do?

21:46.472 --> 21:48.724
I'm gonna try to get Restoration to back out.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.726
And either of these things can work,

21:50.726 --> 21:53.146
but only if we don't tell Thomas.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.732
You are putting me in a really shitty position.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.735
No, Donna. Simon put us all in a shitty position.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.030
I'm busting my ass to get us out of this.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.407
I just need you to trust me.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.124
Wanna tell me what's going on with you and Louis?

22:13.124 --> 22:14.834
What are you talking about?

22:14.834 --> 22:17.044
I heard what happened in court yesterday.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.630
And I know you. You're not about to let this lie.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.091
So what if I'm not? I want you not to do

22:22.091 --> 22:24.051
whatever it is I know you're going to.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.847
Look. If this is about plausible deniability,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.183
don't worry. Consider yourself out of it.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.185
It has nothing to do with plau--

22:32.185 --> 22:34.645
Samantha, you cannot do what we did.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.647
I'm telling you, you'll regret it.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.691
Bullshit.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.900
You didn't regret it.

22:39.900 --> 22:40.985
Yes, I did.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.570
And since when is that?

22:43.570 --> 22:46.824
Last time we talked about it, you were right as rain.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.535
Last time we talked about it was eight years ago.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.495
And you don't know what happens over time

22:51.495 --> 22:53.539
when you do something like that.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.877
He's hurting, Robert.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.171
Louis is hurting.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.298
You saw what he was like when it happened.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.801
You saw what I was like when it happened to me.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.386
So what am I supposed to do?

23:08.386 --> 23:11.682
I want you to promise me you'll find another way.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.736
Donna. I was just thinking about you.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.739
I was thinking about you too, Mom. Funny how that happens.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.367
What's on your mind, honey?

23:29.367 --> 23:32.661
Do you remember my senior year, when we were gonna go to Paris?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.955
Of course I remember. Why?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.958
DONNA: <i>Well, I have</i>

23:34.955 --> 23:37.958
<i>a decision to make.</i>

23:37.958 --> 23:39.417
One side is work

23:39.417 --> 23:42.922
and the other side is someone I care about.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.299
Actually, both sides involve someone I care about.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.968
MOTHER: <i>I bet I can guess who</i>

23:45.299 --> 23:47.968
<i>the work side involves.</i>

23:47.968 --> 23:50.470
But what does that have to do with Paris?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.514
Do you regret giving Dad the money?

23:52.514 --> 23:53.766
No, I don't.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.517
DONNA: <i>Even though it didn't work out?</i>

23:55.517 --> 23:58.354
MOTHER: <i>Well, how could</i>

23:55.517 --> 23:58.354
<i>I have known that?</i>

23:58.354 --> 24:00.606
Because Dad let you down before.

24:00.606 --> 24:04.193
Donna, your father has never let me down.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.153
Not in the ways that matter.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.738
What do you mean?

24:07.738 --> 24:12.201
MOTHER: <i>Your father</i>

24:07.738 --> 24:12.201
<i>is the kindest, gentlest,</i>

24:12.201 --> 24:14.287
most loving man I have ever met.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.122
And if I hadn't shown faith in him,

24:16.122 --> 24:18.958
it would've eaten away at him for the rest of his life.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.710
So...

24:22.878 --> 24:26.257
if you had it all to do over again,

24:26.257 --> 24:27.841
would you make the same choice?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.551
MOTHER: <i>I can't tell you that.</i>

24:29.551 --> 24:33.431
But what I do regret is we never took that trip.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.642
<i>So go with your gut,</i>

24:36.642 --> 24:38.811
but don't let the once-in-a-lifetime chances

24:38.811 --> 24:39.937
pass you by.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.521
Hey, Mom.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.525
What do you say we go to Paris next year?

24:45.525 --> 24:48.028
I say yes.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.575
BRIAN: Mr. Barrow, this isn't about

24:50.323 --> 24:53.575
amounts of ammonia

24:53.575 --> 24:56.203
so small they're a technical violation of our lease.

24:56.203 --> 24:59.957
This is about you having another tenant willing to pay more.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.376
Who I may or may not have doesn't matter.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.962
It should. Because we're willing to offer you

25:04.962 --> 25:06.630
something they're not.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.590
Ten percent equity in the company.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.550
A fledgling company with unproven revenue.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.636
BRIAN: No, Morgan.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.636
They're more than that.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.388
When you look at our client, you see

25:14.388 --> 25:17.099
a naïve, young entrepreneur and not much else.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.810
And on paper, that's exactly what she is.

25:19.810 --> 25:23.147
But sometimes who someone is on paper isn't who they are at all.

25:23.147 --> 25:27.193
My client may be young, but she's brilliant.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.902
And hardworking.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.571
And most importantly, passionate.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.615
That's why I'm proud to work with her.

25:33.615 --> 25:36.702
And why, if you get in on the ground floor right now,

25:36.702 --> 25:40.873
you won't need to worry about leases or any of that anymore.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.626
Because you'll be on an island somewhere sipping piña coladas

25:44.626 --> 25:48.130
paid for by the brilliant decision you made today.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.341
The only thing I'd be paying for

25:50.341 --> 25:52.301
is some snake oil and a silver tongue.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.552
Because that's the biggest load

25:54.552 --> 25:56.805
of sappy bullshit from-- Shut your mouth.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.141
This man is defending his client's honor.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.934
He's doing it by offering something

26:00.934 --> 26:02.728
you don't deserve, and I've had it.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.271
Katrina. You think I don't know

26:04.271 --> 26:06.106
who your mysterious other tenant is?

26:06.106 --> 26:08.942
I do. And if a food distribution company

26:08.942 --> 26:10.610
rents space that's been exposed

26:10.610 --> 26:12.612
to significant amounts of ammonia

26:12.612 --> 26:14.281
without you disclosing it,

26:14.281 --> 26:15.533
you'll go to prison.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.950
You can't do this.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.744
Yes, we can, you piece of shit.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.621
In fact, that offer just went away.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.665
So keep us in or kick us out,

26:23.665 --> 26:25.625
but your next tenant isn't gonna be

26:25.625 --> 26:28.170
the goddamn one you had in mind.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.973
I've never seen you like that. Where did that come from?

26:39.973 --> 26:43.685
It came from knowing this is your first client,

26:43.685 --> 26:45.979
and I wasn't gonna let them beat you.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.065
Like you've done for me countless times.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.276
How did you even know what company it was?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.152
I didn't.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.154
But 50 percent of PATTIE's predictions

26:54.154 --> 26:57.533
were food companies, so I bluffed.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.743
If it had turned out they made clocks,

26:59.743 --> 27:02.329
we would have been in big trouble.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.705
What?

27:03.705 --> 27:07.376
You continue to surprise me.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.044
Because I never saw you as someone

27:09.044 --> 27:11.380
who'd take a chance on a fifty-fifty bet.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.257
I wouldn't have before I met you.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.426
I guess I've made you a better lawyer.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.095
I meant, in my mind it was fifty-fifty

27:18.095 --> 27:20.306
if keeping you on was going to work out.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.476
I don't believe it. Gambling, making jokes. Who are you?

27:23.476 --> 27:24.977
I'll tell you who I am.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.897
I am the person who is proud to officially give you

27:28.897 --> 27:30.524
your first solo client.

27:31.609 --> 27:32.818
Thanks, Katrina.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.195
I really appreciate it.

27:35.195 --> 27:38.115
I can't wait to go home and share the news.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.791
What's going on

27:47.791 --> 27:49.751
Change of plans.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.253
What do you mean? I didn't know

27:51.253 --> 27:53.130
what the plan was in the first place.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.215
You did. I was gonna do something illegal,

27:55.215 --> 27:56.967
and I'm not gonna do that anymore.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.511
What's the new plan?

28:01.096 --> 28:03.349
You talking about leveraging? Yes, I am.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.559
Samantha, this is a child. I know what it is.

28:05.559 --> 28:08.145
You, of all people, coming from where you come from,

28:08.145 --> 28:10.105
should know that doing this could ruin her life.

28:10.105 --> 28:13.025
Only if it doesn't work. Which is why we'll make it work.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.027
No, we're not. I'll do it alone.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.445
I don't think you heard me.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.405
You said you don't wanna live in fear.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.907
No, I said I wanna go after him.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.618
This is going after him.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.578
Goddamn it, it's his family.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.164
It's a family.

28:30.125 --> 28:33.045
I know it is, Louis.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.712
But it's your family too.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.342
So, what do you wanna do?

28:40.427 --> 28:42.846
THOMAS: All I'm saying is,

28:40.427 --> 28:42.846
would it be terrible

28:42.846 --> 28:44.306
if Thomas Kessler became

28:44.306 --> 28:47.017
the official furniture of the United Nations?

28:47.017 --> 28:49.269
Am I going on too much about this expansion?

28:49.269 --> 28:52.189
We can go out right now, don't have to talk about it at all.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.525
No, no, it's not that. It's just...

28:55.526 --> 28:57.236
I haven't been feeling well.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.488
I had that same feeling earlier today.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.614
How so?

29:00.614 --> 29:02.991
My original mall owner called me.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.911
He wants me back. Even offered a much better deal than Simon.

29:05.911 --> 29:09.289
Thomas, that's fantastic. Why would that make you feel bad?

29:09.289 --> 29:11.625
I already have a deal in place with Simon Lowe.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.002
It was hard to tell him you're backing out.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.089
No, it was hard to tell Glen that I was passing.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.174
What?

29:20.593 --> 29:21.927
You passed on a better deal?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.637
Not formally. But when I told him,

29:23.637 --> 29:27.725
Glen gave me up until 10 tomorrow to decide, and...

29:27.725 --> 29:31.144
I'll take it as a courtesy, but I really don't need to.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.731
I shook Simon's hand. He's my guy.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.027
What?

29:39.027 --> 29:40.487
Nothing.

29:40.487 --> 29:43.741
It's one of the things that I admire about you.

29:43.741 --> 29:46.410
You're a man of your word.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.245
But speaking of not feeling well,

29:48.245 --> 29:51.707
I think I'm just gonna... go get some ginger ale.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.166
Donna, come on, don't be silly.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.127
Let me get it for you. No. Actually...

29:55.127 --> 29:56.920
I think I need some fresh air.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.005
You stay here. I'll be back in 10 minutes.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.634
You sure? I'm sure.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.059
Hello? DONNA:<i> What's going on</i>

30:11.059 --> 30:12.978
with getting Restoration to back out?

30:12.978 --> 30:14.605
Thomas didn't tell you?

30:14.605 --> 30:17.107
Alex got his old landlord to crush Simon's offer.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.818
He did tell me. He also told me that he's not taking it.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.445
And it disappears tomorrow.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.489
Shit.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.240
Look, we can still fix it.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.408
How are we gonna fix it?

30:26.408 --> 30:28.452
I can get Restoration to back out.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.455
What if you don't? Thomas will lose his expansion,

30:31.455 --> 30:33.081
and I'm not gonna let that happen.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.834
Neither am I, Donna. This thing isn't over.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.503
I just need you to have faith.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.171
<i>I'll text you</i> <i>in the morning.</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:41.632
Please, don't do anything until you hear from me.

30:41.632 --> 30:43.759
Okay, Harvey.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.679
I'll wait to hear from you.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.482
What are you doing here? We know the mother of your child

30:58.482 --> 31:00.818
is the recipient of Section 8 Housing benefits.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.778
She's in danger of losing them. What?

31:02.778 --> 31:05.864
That assistance can't go to someone with a criminal history.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.616
She doesn't have a criminal history.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.201
But you do. I don't live there.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.328
Oh? You said you did when you got arrested.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.246
I have a gas bill with your name on it.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.500
We go to the Housing Authority, you'll lose your daughter.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.918
Bullshit. No, not bullshit, Maurice.

31:18.918 --> 31:20.170
You're getting evicted.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.463
You think Family Services

31:21.463 --> 31:23.340
will let your little girl be homeless?

31:23.340 --> 31:25.509
What do you want from me

31:25.509 --> 31:26.926
'Cause that ain't happening.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.887
Turn yourself in, admit what you did.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.972
You think that's what's happening here?

31:30.972 --> 31:34.309
I know that's what's happening. Nah, you ain't doing that.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.853
Why you think I picked you?

31:35.853 --> 31:38.063
I could've taken 10 people into that alley,

31:38.063 --> 31:40.566
but the second I saw you, I knew you were my guy.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.901
Motherfucker. When you held that gun to my head,

31:42.901 --> 31:45.028
told me not to look at you, I was afraid.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.321
Do I seem afraid now?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.407
Only one person is making a call tonight.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.533
You're turning yourself in

31:49.533 --> 31:51.326
or I'm calling the Housing Authority.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.704
No way you put a woman and child on the street.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.539
I'm not putting them there, Mo.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.624
You are. Watch.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.085
Nah, you ain't doing that. I know where you live.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.796
MAN: <i>You've reached the New York</i>

32:00.085 --> 32:02.796
<i>Housing Authority.</i>

32:02.796 --> 32:05.340
Hi, I'd like to report a Section 8 violation.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.592
Put the phone down.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.468
There's a woman living with a criminal,

32:08.468 --> 32:10.679
and she's leaving his name off the lease.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.098
I said put it down. You can call Family Services.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.850
The woman's name-- You motherf--

32:16.852 --> 32:19.855
What's it gonna be? Because in another two seconds,

32:19.855 --> 32:21.231
they'll have your name.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.816
Okay, I'll make the call.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.484
I just made it for you. 911. Say hi.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.319
WOMAN: <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

32:26.319 --> 32:27.571
I wanna report a crime.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.281
WOMAN: <i>Sir, what did you witness?</i>

32:29.281 --> 32:31.408
I ain't a witness. I'm the one who did it.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.292
Am I interrupting?

32:40.292 --> 32:41.877
No. I was just reading.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.587
Tennessee Williams.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.380
I know it might cost more,

32:45.380 --> 32:48.383
but if anyone's doing one of his plays when we're in Paris--

32:48.383 --> 32:51.344
Actually, honey, that's what I wanted

32:51.344 --> 32:53.847
to talk to you about. Paris. What about it?

32:53.847 --> 32:57.016
Your dad has a building he wants to buy.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.436
And in order to secure the loan, we're gonna--

32:59.436 --> 33:01.229
He needs our Paris money.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.398
Honey, it doesn't mean we're not gonna go.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.859
It just means we can't go this year.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.235
But you saved for so long.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.028
And if you use the money for this--

33:09.028 --> 33:10.656
It's not like that.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.826
In two years, we're gonna have our money back plus more.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.119
And then we're gonna be able to go for a month

33:16.119 --> 33:17.579
instead of two weeks.

33:17.579 --> 33:21.792
You're not sure this is gonna work, are you?

33:21.792 --> 33:25.086
I forgot you can do that.

33:25.086 --> 33:28.006
Donna, I promise you.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.383
We are going to Paris.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.886
I understand.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.805
Another year.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.266
You know, I gotta say, I may be coming around

33:38.266 --> 33:40.185
to your way of making coffee after all.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.561
Thomas?

33:41.561 --> 33:44.314
Simon Lowe was using you as a stalking horse.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.817
The deal you made was a ploy

33:46.817 --> 33:49.361
to get Restoration Hardware to the table.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.489
You're a backup plan. It's why your deal hasn't closed yet.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.452
Why are you the one telling me and not my lawyer?

33:57.452 --> 34:00.664
Because Alex is trying to fix it.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.457
So is Harvey. But I don't know

34:02.457 --> 34:04.334
that they're gonna be able to fix it.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.461
And your other offer expires this morning,

34:06.461 --> 34:08.046
and I don't wanna be responsible.

34:08.046 --> 34:12.091
Donna, you are not responsible for anything. Okay?

34:12.091 --> 34:13.802
So, what are you gonna do?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.554
I'll tell you what I'm not gonna do.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.931
Let the company that I've spent my life nurturing

34:17.931 --> 34:21.059
get taken out at the knees just when it's starting to walk.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.776
Thomas. I didn't see we had a meeting on the books.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.820
We didn't. But this won't take long.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.572
I'm going with Glen.

34:35.365 --> 34:38.911
Thomas, that's great. I'll get on it right away.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.537
Listen, first things first.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.205
I wanna issue a press release.

34:42.205 --> 34:45.083
I don't want the world to think we're going with Pierpont.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.835
Listen-- Unless there's some reason

34:46.835 --> 34:49.254
you wouldn't want me to announce I'm pulling out.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.589
You know.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.591
You're damn right I know. Donna told me,

34:52.591 --> 34:55.635
and she wouldn't have had to if you hadn't kept this from me.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.303
I kept it because I shouldn't have known.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.347
You got the deal because I made it happen.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.935
You leverage him into a better deal based on Pierpont's offer,

35:02.935 --> 35:04.603
something I never would've wanted.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.480
Which is why I'm taking Glen's offer at the original rate

35:07.480 --> 35:09.315
and putting out an announcement.

35:09.315 --> 35:12.277
You do that, it screws over the guy who told us about this.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.570
I'm sorry, Alex.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.906
This is my business and my reputation.

35:15.906 --> 35:18.784
I'm putting out a message I'm not gonna act in bad faith

35:18.784 --> 35:21.536
or be treated in bad faith.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.580
So either you put out that press release

35:23.580 --> 35:24.998
or I'm gonna do it myself.

35:32.255 --> 35:35.467
Brian. How are you are this bright morning?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.969
I'm okay, Katrina,

35:36.969 --> 35:39.596
but there's something I have to tell you.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.389
By all means, go right ahead.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.309
Last night, I was having dinner with Julie...

35:44.309 --> 35:47.562
and I started telling her about us and the case

35:47.562 --> 35:49.188
and what we did for Bespoke.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.608
Where are you going with this?

35:51.608 --> 35:53.359
The whole time I was talking,

35:53.359 --> 35:55.779
I wasn't talking about the case or the client.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.989
I was talking about you.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.240
And Julie said you sound so great,

35:59.240 --> 36:01.034
we should have you over for dinner.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.495
And then she saw a look on my face.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.579
Brian.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.042
She asked if anything had ever happened

36:09.042 --> 36:10.877
between us, and I said no.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.171
And nothing ever will. Even if it doesn't,

36:13.171 --> 36:15.924
I can't feel this way about someone who isn't Julie.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.676
Brian, what are you saying?

36:17.676 --> 36:20.595
I can't work here anymore.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.472
What?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.767
No, you can't-- I have to.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.769
Then I'll go to Louis right now,

36:27.769 --> 36:30.355
and you can be someone else's associate.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.648
Stop.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.943
Brian, please don't do this.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.820
It's gonna be okay.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.114
I promise.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.117
No, it's not.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.710
But I respect your decision.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.255
Goodbye, Katrina.

37:03.555 --> 37:04.973
Harvey, where have you been?

37:04.973 --> 37:06.641
I've been texting you for two hours.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.351
I know. We're running out of time.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.687
I think I've got a way to get Restoration to drop out.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.523
Too late. Your problem's gonna be keeping Restoration in.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.484
What are you talking about? Donna told Thomas everything.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.404
That's

37:19.404 --> 37:21.322
I don't know. He dropped out,

37:21.322 --> 37:24.367
and he's taking out a full-page ad in the<i> Journal</i> to say it.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.327
Fuck. All right.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.746
Right now, I gotta call Simon

37:27.746 --> 37:29.998
and tell him to close that Restoration deal

37:29.998 --> 37:31.583
as soon as possible.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.252
SIMON: It's too late for that.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.252
They called and demanded

37:34.252 --> 37:36.337
a 30 percent reduction, or they're gone.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.799
It's a setback, but Thomas isn't the only stalking horse

37:39.799 --> 37:40.926
out there. I can find--

37:40.926 --> 37:42.468
You're not gonna find me anything

37:42.468 --> 37:44.846
until you can tell me you're not behind this.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.932
Simon, I didn't tell Thomas a thing.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.808
He didn't either? When the two of you

37:48.808 --> 37:50.769
are standing here talking about my deal?

37:50.769 --> 37:53.563
I don't know what you're talking about. My client dropped out.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.066
I was doing your attorney a solid by informing him.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.151
Bullshit.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.736
Someone let Thomas know.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.405
Since you're the only person with the full story,

38:02.405 --> 38:03.865
it had to be you.

38:03.865 --> 38:06.201
And yet here you are, lying right to my face.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.326
Simon--

38:07.326 --> 38:08.536
Save it, Harvey.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.205
You're fired.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.464
What the hell did you do?

38:19.464 --> 38:21.633
I did what I said

38:19.464 --> 38:21.633
I was gonna do.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.676
You said you were gonna find another way.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.137
I did find another way.

38:25.137 --> 38:28.389
Bullshit. A man up and confesses to a crime?

38:28.389 --> 38:30.225
You blackmailed him. No.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.477
I used something he did to get him to confess

38:32.477 --> 38:35.021
to something else he did. That is not blackmail.

38:35.021 --> 38:37.482
It's messing with shit you shouldn't mess with.

38:37.482 --> 38:40.652
It has unintended consequences. Robert, I've had about enough

38:40.652 --> 38:42.988
of your unintended-consequences bullshit.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.448
So either tell me what you are talking about,

38:45.448 --> 38:47.492
or shut the fuck up.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.661
Because Louis didn't get the wrong guy

38:49.661 --> 38:52.371
and neither did you and I. Don't you tell me we did.

38:52.371 --> 38:55.500
Don't you see? It's not about the wrong man.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.794
It's about taking matters into your own hands

38:57.794 --> 38:59.504
and what happens when you do that.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.885
You know, Robert, I just don't get it.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.512
Louis is safe now.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.889
How can you not see that as a good thing?

39:09.889 --> 39:11.933
I know it's a good thing for Louis.

39:11.933 --> 39:16.771
What I'm afraid of is it's gonna become a bad thing for you.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.615
Can I talk to you for a second?

39:27.615 --> 39:30.451
Of course, Brian. But if this is about Bespoke Handbags,

39:30.451 --> 39:33.205
I already approved you as their lead counsel.

39:33.205 --> 39:36.249
Actually, that is why I'm here.

39:36.249 --> 39:39.418
I can't be their lead counsel. Yes, you can, Brian.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.171
Because you deserve them,

39:41.171 --> 39:43.464
which is why I want you to take them with you.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.591
But before I let you go, I wanna know

39:45.591 --> 39:48.469
if this is about what's going on between you and Katrina.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.595
What

39:49.595 --> 39:51.056
I suspected a few weeks ago,

39:51.056 --> 39:52.349
and then she told me.

39:52.349 --> 39:54.309
Then all I can say is it's about doing

39:54.309 --> 39:56.561
what I have to, to protect my family.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.980
Then I say I want you to take Bespoke with you.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.606
Because you've earned them.

40:00.606 --> 40:03.568
I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything.

40:03.568 --> 40:08.865
Because as big as this city is, Brian, it is a very small world.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.783
We're gonna see you in court someday.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.953
And when we do-- I won't go easy on you.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.248
Good man. Are you sure about all this?

40:16.248 --> 40:18.083
Come on, Brian.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.210
You're doing this for your family.

40:20.210 --> 40:24.463
Trust me, no one understands sacrificing for their family

40:24.463 --> 40:25.548
more than me.

40:28.385 --> 40:29.719
I'm proud of you.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.850
Whatever it is, I don't wanna hear it. So turn around--

40:35.850 --> 40:38.853
Harvey. Donna, Simon fired me...

40:38.853 --> 40:40.563
As he had every right to do

40:40.563 --> 40:44.442
because I trusted you to keep your mouth shut and you didn't.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.569
Because I couldn't. What does that mean?

40:46.569 --> 40:49.406
Means I wasn't gonna let someone I care about get screwed

40:49.406 --> 40:50.949
when I had the power to stop it.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.201
In other words, you chose him over the firm.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.452
Yeah, I did.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.204
And I'm not gonna feel bad about it,

40:56.204 --> 40:58.206
because I always put the firm first.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.458
Whether it's Mike's secret or Coastal Motors

41:00.458 --> 41:02.210
or a thousand other things.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.297
Then don't feel bad about it, Donna. But get out of my office.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.882
Okay, I see what this is.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.759
I see what you're really upset about.

41:09.759 --> 41:11.928
I'm upset because I lost a client.

41:11.928 --> 41:14.264
No. You're upset I chose Thomas over you.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.015
That's what you think? Yeah, it is.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.600
Then you don't know anything.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.561
The only reason I was breaking my back to save his deal

41:20.561 --> 41:22.647
is because I know how much he means to you.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.607
If it was anyone else, I never would've

41:24.607 --> 41:26.525
told you or Alex in the first place.

41:26.525 --> 41:27.860
Then what are you mad about?

41:27.860 --> 41:29.779
You didn't give me a chance to fix it

41:29.779 --> 41:31.406
when you said you would.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.616
You lost faith in me.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.828
For all the time we have been together,

41:36.828 --> 41:38.079
that has never happened.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.123
Harvey, if there's anyone in the world

41:40.123 --> 41:42.167
I have faith in...

41:43.418 --> 41:44.502
it's you.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.422
But the clock was striking midnight.

41:47.422 --> 41:50.549
And I had to make a choice. It's just a client.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.593
Can't you understand that?

41:54.012 --> 41:56.514
DANIEL: Am I interrupting?

41:56.514 --> 41:58.724
What are you doing here, Daniel?

41:58.724 --> 42:00.685
I'm here because Simon Lowe hired me

42:00.685 --> 42:02.603
as outside counsel for Pierpont Malls.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.023
All the lawyers in the world and he called you?

42:05.023 --> 42:07.233
No, Donna, I called him.

42:07.233 --> 42:10.028
When I offered my services free of charge, he accepted.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.863
And what services would those be?

42:11.863 --> 42:13.823
Embezzling

42:13.823 --> 42:16.701
Suing this firm on behalf of my new client.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.912
You're a glutton for punishment, Daniel. You know that, right?

42:19.912 --> 42:23.833
Talk tough all you want, but you broke privilege.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.918
And now...

42:25.918 --> 42:27.045
I'm gonna make you pay.
