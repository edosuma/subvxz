With two gobstoppers,

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.787
I could rule the candy world.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.522
Join me.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:53.060
Hey, what the...

01:08:54.197 --> 01:08:55.997
Charlie, pass me the remote.

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:00.702
- (MACHINE BEEPING)
- Stop!

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.638
No! Oh!

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.906
My gobstopper!

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:06.808
I've beamed it into a million pieces.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.343
You'll never get it back.

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:10.545
You'll pay for this, mouse.

No! Put that down, you fool.

Charlie, dear boy, how perfect.

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:42.343
Now you and I can be partners.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:46.447
Our gobstopper will make us
kings of the candy world.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.616
It will make your family rich.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:51.286
Let me have that remote, son.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.854
You won't need it anymore.

It'll take a while before
they could put themselves

01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:11.005
back together again.

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:14.008
Hey, look, the camera added four inches.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.045
I bet I meet the Oompa Loompa
height requirement now.

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:19.480
Well, good riddance to Slugworth, I say.

01:10:19.482 --> 01:10:22.784
Come on, Charlie, we got some
business to attend to.

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:29.824
Excuse me, Mr. Wonka?

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:31.893
WONKA: I am
incredibly busy, sir.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.996
Um, but what about Charlie's
lifetime supply of chocolate?

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:37.565
- When does he get it?
- He doesn't.

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:39.867
What? Why not?

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:42.470
WONKA: Because he broke
the factory rules.

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:43.838
What factory rules?

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.473
We didn't see any rules.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.175
Wrong, sir, wrong.

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:51.012
Under section 37 of the
contract signed by him,

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:55.016
all offers shall become null
and void, etc., etc., etc...

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:57.885
You stole fizzy lifting drinks.

01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:00.188
And to make matters worse,

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:02.523
you allowed a cat into my factory.

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:05.059
A cat and his two filthy mice friends.

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.729
Now the entire factory
will have to be sterilised.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.664
So you get nothing!

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:12.333
You lose! Good day, sir.

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:15.970
You're a cheat.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.672
How can you build up a little boy's hopes

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.474
and then disappoint him like this.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:21.709
I said, "Good day."

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:30.818
Come on, Charlie, you've still got
your gobstopper.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.687
Once we find a way to bring back Slugworth,

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:34.355
he'll pay big money for it.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:40.361
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

a good deed in a weary world.

01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:02.150
Charlie?

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:05.019
My boy, you did it.

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:08.723
You won the contest.
I knew you would. (LAUGHS)

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:10.158
Oh, Charlie, forgive me

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.659
for putting you
and your friends through this.

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:13.294
Forgive me, please, forgive me.

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:15.596
Charlie, let me introduce
Mr. Wilkinson.

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:16.931
Pleasure to meet you, Charlie.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.966
- Slugworth.
- No, this isn't Slugworth.

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:21.336
He's one of my workers.
He was only pretending.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:24.739
But you said you had a master plan
against Mr. Wonka.

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.174
(LAUGHS) No, my boy.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.943
My master plan was
to help Wonka find an heir.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:30.978
I was concerned that you and Tom and Jerry

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.447
would interfere with that plan.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.382
So, I had to try and stop you.

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:35.983
Who knew?

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.318
Oh, Charlie, I had to test you,

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.887
and you passed with flying colors.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:41.756
This is all so exciting.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:42.957
But we have to get going.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:45.360
So much time and so little to do.

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:47.161
Strike that. Reverse it.

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:50.665
We'll take the Wonkavator.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:53.201
If you please, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:55.303
Oh, Tuffy.

01:12:55.305 --> 01:12:57.438

Wait, I was only doing my job.

- How am I going to get home now?
- Hey, what did you do?

Don't put me on the drawer.
