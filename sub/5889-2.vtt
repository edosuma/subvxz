Everything was very polite.
A few questions, a few answers.

You have such beautiful mouth.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.807
It's perfect.

03:31.800 --> 03:37.011
Lizzy. I'd like to introduce you
to my manicurist, Rosa Heredia.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.521
She's the one I was telling you about...

03:39.720 --> 03:42.564
...who was dating
that nine-fingered bullfighter from Juarez.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.889
This woman is an artist...

03:45.120 --> 03:48.203
...trained at the Latin-American
school of medicine in Havana.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.528
- Medical school?
- Trauma surgeon.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.530
Dropped out
in the last year of her residency.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.404
Your ex-wife, have you found her?

04:04.640 --> 04:07.086
Jennifer. What have you learned
about Jennifer?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.243
I confirmed your daughter
was placed in protective custody...

04:11.480 --> 04:12.891
...with her mother in 1990.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.084
The Marshals Service lost contact
seven years ago.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.601
She is unaccounted for.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.723
Monarch Douglas Bank.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.241
What?

04:28.440 --> 04:31.171
The preferred bank
of international criminals, dictators...

04:31.360 --> 04:33.169
...terrorists, hedge-fund managers.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.362
They're headquartered here
in the U.S...

04:35.560 --> 04:37.210
...deposits insured by the FDIC...

04:37.400 --> 04:41.769
...which places them firmly within
your agency's jurisdictional bailiwick.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.928
They have branches in 63 countries...

04:44.120 --> 04:46.248
...but their criminal operation is run...

04:46.440 --> 04:49.046
...out of an unassuming little branch
in Warsaw.

04:49.240 --> 04:53.370
And it is the last place on earth
that anyone would ever want to rob.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.444
Well, less than two hours ago...

04:56.640 --> 04:58.563
...Monarch's Warsaw branch
was assaulted.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.445
And what was stolen?

05:00.640 --> 05:02.210
Official statement, nothing.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.851
And according to you?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.489
Everything.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.801
Dante Stewart,
the notorious arms dealer...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.561
...the Juarez cartel,
the entire Marbella crime syndicate.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.286
Reddington claims
these are a few of the criminals...

05:17.480 --> 05:18.970
...who funnel money
through Monarch Douglas.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.731
Contacts at Treasury say
Monarch's records are spotless.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.928
They're in full compliance.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.400
According to Reddington,
they're legendary...

05:27.600 --> 05:30.490
...for laundering the money of the criminal
elite without any traceable accounting.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.041
There has to be some kind of record.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.888
- Must be what they're looking for.
- Ledger.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.402
More valuable than the millions in assets
they left in that vault.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.762
Bank can't cooperate
without implicating itself.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.406
Take down Monarch,
we get names of every criminal...

05:44.600 --> 05:47.729
...who funnels money through them.
- I'll contact our legal attaché.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.491
- You and Ressler, next flight to Warsaw.
- Yes, sir.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.569
Aram.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.801
Everything okay?

05:55.040 --> 05:57.566
Yeah, I'm fine. Just missed my train.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.881
What?

06:24.920 --> 06:28.003
- What is it?
- It was at the front desk.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.648
- Agent Paul Salerno.
- Agents Ressler and Keen.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.649
We've established
joint cooperation with the locals...

06:54.840 --> 06:57.081
...extradition orders
for any suspects charged.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.443
While you are in country, you do
not have the power to make arrests.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.689
- You'll, of course, be unarmed.
- We had a briefing before we left.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.326
Hear you guys are part
of some elite task force?

07:06.520 --> 07:09.126
- Where's the vault?
- The scene's still being processed.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.203
We're just in time, then.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.321
Our sources said
that nothing was reported stolen.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.648
Your sources were wrong.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.283
Matt Strickland,
EVP of Branch Operations.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.642
Agents Ressler and Keen, FBI.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.281
We understand you're headquartered
in Manhattan.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.244
I flew out the minute I got the news.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.046
Our fault.
Snafu in corporate communications.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.890
The first press release was wrong.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.811
They got away
with over 400,000 in bearer bonds.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.889
We're releasing a corrected statement.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.404
We need access to your data,
operating procedures, your employees.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.443
Of course. I'll make arrangements.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.688
Anything you need...

07:48.640 --> 07:50.529
You'll have our complete cooperation.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.085
Thank you, Mr. Strickland.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.970
If you'll excuse me.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.690
What were you thinking
with that press release?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.564
The important thing is, The Formula.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.683
The Formula is the problem!

08:03.920 --> 08:06.280
Formula is missing.
Means the money is missing.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.006
Clients are calling. They're concerned.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.046
If we don't fix this now, we're all dead.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.164
Okay.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.169
Make me one.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.769
Colonel Yusuf.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.525
Yusuf.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.883
No inconsistencies
in my witness statements.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.287
They hacked the system,
shut it down...

08:36.480 --> 08:39.847
...deleted everything
back to a half-hour before they hit.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.365
What?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.122
Traffic-police
services forwarded their feeds.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.800
- You got picture?
- Yep. But lousy angle, though.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.843
Can't see what went down inside.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.647
But they caught the bad guys
coming in and going out.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.128
- Mirroring the feed now. You seeing this?
- Yeah. Got it. Go.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.245
We got five unsubs.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.290
Not so fast. Check this out.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.485
- Six. I got six. Is that right?
- Yep.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.523
Five went in, six came out.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.803
Aram,
can you zoom in on number four?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.968
Copy that.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.564
- That's a woman.
- She looks scared.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.764
This wasn't a robbery,
it was a kidnapping.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.525
Only one employee
who swiped into the Warsaw branch...

09:36.760 --> 09:40.446
...the day of the incident
who didn't swipe out. Kaja Tomczak.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.206
- What can you tell us about her?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.722
As EVP, I typically have little contact
with branches of this size.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.288
- No contact with account managers.
- Before robbery, she went home sick.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.046
She must have forgotten
to swipe her card on way out.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.887
Oh, Johnny-on-the-spot. Had that
one locked and chambered, did we?

09:57.080 --> 10:00.562
I'm sorry, I do not understand
this Johnny-on-the-spot.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.400
- That'll do, Kloza.
- This is your American comedy?

10:03.480 --> 10:05.050
Shut up.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.720
I'm sorry, Agent Keen.
Tensions are running high.

10:07.960 --> 10:09.405
We've never been robbed before.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.763
We're gonna need a copy
of Kaja Tomczak's employee file.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.684
Of course.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.401
- The apartment is owned by Monarch?
- Yes. This one, five, six more.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.809
Employees here on long business trips.
Better than hotel.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.004
- Did you know Miss Tomczak well?
- No. Was nice, very nice...

10:26.200 --> 10:28.851
...but never spoke to her alone.
Men are always with her.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.442
- Men?
- Walk her to the door, pick her up.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.644
Bring food, take her to work.
Like guards.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.205
Always guards.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.767
Ressler.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.283
Yeah. We'll be right in.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.562
They found the getaway van.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.808
Unsubs tried to torch it with accelerant.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.610
Fire burned itself out.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.882
They should've cracked a window.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.724
Hey, you guys see this up here?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.684
Is that blood?

11:03.960 --> 11:05.644
I don't think so.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.286
You know that's where people sit,
right?

11:09.640 --> 11:13.361
- Smells like roses.
- Set a match to it, see if it burns.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.210
- Check if it's flammable.
- What? Why?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.726
You got a light?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.325
Yeah. It's flammable.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.567
Jam.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.730
From the heart of the rum-soaked,
rose-petal paczki.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.689
I don't know what a rum-soaked, ro...

11:33.920 --> 11:35.365
It's a jelly doughnut.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.365
Lovely. Now what?

11:37.560 --> 11:38.607
Now? Nothing.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.322
Just get some rest. I'll be there in less
than three hours. Then something.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.969
The copper mine will have to wait.
We're going to Warsaw.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.891
Your assets are safe.
It's a minor systems problem.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.048
I was told Warsaw was hit.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.765
Completely unrelated.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.123
This is an IT issue that will be resolved
within the next few hours.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.647
I'm waiting to take possession
of vital cargo...

11:58.840 --> 12:02.561
...that's now sitting in a container ship
just off the coast of Mogadishu.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.046
I can't get the cargo...

12:04.280 --> 12:08.365
...until I have a confirmation
of a wire transfer I made 36 hours ago.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.131
And we would be more than happy
to advance funds.

12:11.320 --> 12:15.405
- You talking about a loan?
Interest-free, of course.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.809
Mr. Strickland,
I think you will come to New York...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.844
...and I will talk to you,
you will answer all my questions...

12:22.040 --> 12:24.850
...to my satisfaction, all right?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.610
Hey!

12:39.680 --> 12:43.366
No more food, Suka.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.240
- Raymond.
- Heh, heh, heh.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.323
Apolonia.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.881
My darling.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.285
And Dembe.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.201
How is my sweet, gentle boy?

13:10.480 --> 13:13.051
I've been dreaming of paczki.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.483
I tried to curb my cravings
in this little shop...

13:16.680 --> 13:20.366
...in the West Village in New York,
but they fill them with prune jelly.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.166
Can you imagine?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.050
Ah.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.330
Mm.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.568
Tastes just like Patty Sutton.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.850
I must admit, mój droga,
I have ulterior motives.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.088
Little business.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.011
Sales up, business good.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.122
I finish inventory.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.120
Then you have something nice
to pick from.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.723
And maybe something
for my little favorite too.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.367
My grandmother used to keep flour
in the refrigerator. Why is that?

14:05.560 --> 14:07.927
To keep the weevils out.

14:08.120 --> 14:11.044
Oh, of course, weevils.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.444
It's come to my attention...

14:13.640 --> 14:16.371
...that the Monarch Douglas Bank
was robbed yesterday...

14:16.560 --> 14:19.006
...by some of your customers.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.363
And if your customers
come under scrutiny, Apolonia...

14:22.560 --> 14:24.961
...your business comes under scrutiny.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.728
God can't protect you.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.763
But I can.

14:34.920 --> 14:35.967
Hands in the air!

14:39.040 --> 14:41.327
Kaja Tomczak. FBI.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.005
What are you doing here?

14:43.160 --> 14:45.686
- Wow. Good to see you too.
- You're safe now.

14:45.880 --> 14:49.202
I was safe before you got here.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.404
I was trying to escape.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.131
- What's the rendezvous point?
- Safe house across the river.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.051
Sending you the address now.
Agent Salerno's on his way.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.924
Head toward the Vistula River.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.929
Her associates? You identified them?

15:10.120 --> 15:13.647
Warsaw gang, Mayerchak Group.
Armed robbery and money laundering.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.569
Rough trade for a bank clerk.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.969
Get a statement. I wanna know everything
she knows before this blows up.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.482
If the police know where I am,
so does Strickland.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.810
- We're doing a threat assessment.
- Heh, heh.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.645
You moneymen,
you love military terms.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.161
Your tactics, strategies...

15:34.360 --> 15:36.966
...your campaigns,
and hostile takeovers, huh?

15:38.080 --> 15:39.320
Now, you promised me...

15:39.520 --> 15:43.241
...that this would all be resolved by now,
and it isn't.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.408
You think I would have flown
to New York...

15:45.600 --> 15:49.400
...met with you, if I wasn't confident
in our handling of the situation?

15:49.560 --> 15:52.086
Uh-huh.
- The situation is fluid.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.406
You need to be patient.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.130
I like you, Mr. Strickland.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.130
I like the way you and your people
do business.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.322
But I need you to understand...

16:00.560 --> 16:02.130
...if you bungle this...

16:02.320 --> 16:08.601
...the people I'm working with,
they expect me to set an example...

16:08.800 --> 16:13.283
...to peel you like a grape.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.486
And I can assure you,
as your banker...

16:20.680 --> 16:24.002
...that your assets are protected
by The Formula.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.006
Oh, yeah. The Formula.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.487
Tell me, how does she do it?

16:29.680 --> 16:31.921
It's called hyperthymesia.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.248
Highly superior
autobiographical memory.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.124
Like a photographic memory.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.881
It's why the bank hired me,
so there wouldn't be any paper trail.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.002
Pick a day, any day, any year.

16:43.560 --> 16:48.043
Uh, December 21st, 2010.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.605
It was a Tuesday.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.644
I had dry toast for breakfast,
bigos for lunch.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.330
I picked up a copy of the Fakt.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.285
Two earthquakes.
One in Japan, Bonin Islands...

16:57.480 --> 16:59.403
...another in Iran, 6.5.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.365
- There was a lunar eclipse.
- That's incredible.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.243
It could not be seen here, but...

17:04.440 --> 17:05.726
Anything interesting?

17:06.160 --> 17:09.561
She drained the accounts of every
criminal who had money at that bank.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.205
Keeps it all in her head,
how the bank does it.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.290
She can give us account numbers,
amounts.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.247
- Who are our friends?
- Not taking any chances...

17:20.440 --> 17:22.363
...till she's turned over to the police.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.762
- She's coming back to the States.
- You don't make that call.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.804
Agent Harold Cooper already did.
Perhaps you'd like to spe... Unh!

17:35.320 --> 17:39.006
A sheet of paper, I... I don't just
look at it and remember every word.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.047
I relive it. The temperature of the room,
the light.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.410
Cameras in your apartment, guards.
They were watching you.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.329
For my protection.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.524
Then...

17:57.000 --> 17:58.411
You became the prisoner.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.761
Ressler!

18:03.240 --> 18:06.403
I staged it at the bank
to ensure there'd be an investigation.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.131
Ressler!

18:29.280 --> 18:31.009
It's over, pal.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.885
- Who do you work for?
- You don't understand...

18:34.080 --> 18:37.084
...the national-security implications
of what that woman knows...

18:37.280 --> 18:39.760
...and the damage she can do.
- They're coming.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.168
- Who the hell are you?
- Samar Navabi. Mossad.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.807
- You're outgunned. Go. I'll cover you.
- How do we know we can trust you?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.411
Go!

18:59.520 --> 19:01.921
What was that back there?
You almost got me killed.

19:02.160 --> 19:05.448
Sorry, wasn't expecting the mirror
to explode three feet from my face.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.007
- Took me a few seconds to regroup.
- More.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.531
Your reaction time was crap.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.166
Bullet fragment.
Passed through on our way out.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.681
Okay, I know, I know.
Just stay still. Stay still.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.967
My seats!

19:16.160 --> 19:17.491
You're ruining my car!

19:18.560 --> 19:20.289
- It's bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.

19:20.480 --> 19:22.926
You know I can hear everything
you're saying?

19:23.120 --> 19:25.009
Okay. Okay.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.889
Okay. Good, good, good.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.481
You're not going to...

19:31.680 --> 19:34.490
I need you to stay still, okay?
On the count of three.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.607
One...

19:39.880 --> 19:41.644
Hang on.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.961
- What is it?
- Unh. It's my stomach.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.725
I'm... I'm so sick.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.641
- Bathroom?
- Please.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.250
Why are we stopping?

20:17.480 --> 20:19.200
The police. The road is blocked.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.327
They're watching every move.
Gotta get out of here.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.965
Whe...? Where do we go?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.726
How? If they're monitoring the streets,
the sidewalks?

20:27.280 --> 20:28.486
Over here!

20:30.160 --> 20:31.764
Let's go.

20:32.760 --> 20:33.807
Over here!

20:35.040 --> 20:37.088
- There was a bleeding woman in my car...
- Shut up!

20:43.120 --> 20:45.088
- See?
- Where'd they go?

20:45.280 --> 20:48.443
- They ran out that side by the stores.
- Take him!

20:50.240 --> 20:52.368
There are three of them...
One is bleeding...

20:52.600 --> 20:53.840
Back by the stores.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.607
Hello, police?
My car was stolen!

20:57.040 --> 20:58.565
Two Americans.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.287
They had... a girl. And she was...

21:01.480 --> 21:02.561
bleeding!

21:02.760 --> 21:03.886
Please!

21:04.280 --> 21:06.567
I'm at plac Dionizego Henkla.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.000
Please hurry!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.680
You're in a stolen car?

21:30.760 --> 21:32.888
We had to. Salerno's dirty.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.287
The safe house was assaulted
by a TAC team.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.443
And why are we being trailed
by Mossad?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.881
- Say again?
- Samar Navabi?

21:40.080 --> 21:42.003
She took down Salerno,
covered our escape.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.929
But Kaja's been shot.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.407
Listen to me.
You two need to ditch the car...

21:46.600 --> 21:48.728
...dump your phones,
get off the grid now.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.366
The nearest landline
to their current location?

21:51.720 --> 21:55.361
Okay, four blocks ahead,
corner of Stalowa and Srodkowa.

21:55.560 --> 21:58.404
- Find it. I'll call you there in 10.
- Got it.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.080
Who the hell is Samar Navabi?

22:01.280 --> 22:02.930
Mrs. Reddington!

22:03.120 --> 22:05.407
Enough is enough! There's no escape!

22:05.760 --> 22:07.330
And the more time we waste...

22:07.520 --> 22:10.364
...the harder it's gonna be for you
when we find you!

22:12.440 --> 22:13.965
- Cooper?
- Harold tells me...

22:14.160 --> 22:17.164
...the local police may not be
your greatest ally.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.600
Get us out of here.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.041
I've reached out to an old friend
for assistance.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.924
Kaspar Dubicki's my man in Warsaw.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.805
He's waiting for you
under the Swietokrzyski Bridge.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.606
Two and a half kilometers
east of your current position.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.723
Two and a half kilometers
is a world away.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.924
Million dirty cops between here
and there. They're all after her.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.130
I've arranged for a small diversion.
Just get to Dubicki.

22:37.520 --> 22:38.646
Can we trust him?

22:38.840 --> 22:42.083
No. You can trust me.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.966
Tell Reddington it is done.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.288
Yeah. Big boom.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.044
It's clear.

23:11.800 --> 23:15.168
The tracks run all the way
to the bridge.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.249
All right. Hang on.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.642
Mrs. Reddington!

23:59.680 --> 24:01.489
Shh.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.762
You're a clever girl.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.923
Keep that down.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.087
Take these.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.566
It'll help with the pain.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.524
Thank you.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.801
Account number 924386.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.686
- Shell company is Gonzalez cargo.
- What are you doing?

24:34.360 --> 24:36.169
Dying declaration.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.600
No.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.802
You're not dying, not today.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.641
I wasn't always a prisoner.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.808
In the beginning...

24:46.240 --> 24:51.883
...the bank paid me,
gave me apartment, a car.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.445
I knew what they were doing.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.803
Terrorist, cartels, organized crime.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.131
But I looked the other way.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.721
I helped them stay in business.
I'm no better than they are.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.366
What the hell?

25:13.840 --> 25:15.729
We've gotta be 10 minutes out.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.248
- Reddington. How did you...?
- Enough with the guns.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.811
I love trains.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.729
My grandfather rode the rails.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.167
Have you ever seen The General?
Buster Keaton?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.562
- Oh, my goodness.
- What are you doing?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.366
Dubicki said the bridge
was swarming with police.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.721
We need to move quickly.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.287
- And Kaja?
- Quite safe, I assure you.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.209
On her way to my Gulf stream.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.044
I'll arrange for an on board medic
to tend to her wounds.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.242
We'll be wheels up in 20.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.330
I've also booked the two of you
first-class tickets home.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.681
You can't take her. No!

26:15.760 --> 26:18.286
Guys, guys. Enough with the pointing.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.165
Don't worry, Donald.
They won't shoot you.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.761
But they will restrain you.
Rigorously if necessary.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.568
If you'll excuse me, I have business to
attend to. Be sure they make their flight.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.080
Ooh.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.443
- No. No, no.
- Come on.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.210
Let's make some music, huh?

26:43.680 --> 26:44.727
Yes?

26:46.840 --> 26:48.490
It's him.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.207
Yeah, hello?

26:55.400 --> 26:57.971
I think it's time we met.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.968
Well, well.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.600
This has been a long time coming.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.927
I hope it's been worth it.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.285
What a terrible waste.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.484
Time, blood, money.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.804
And in the end, for what?

27:52.240 --> 27:53.651
Revenge.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.968
That's my passion.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.566
Revenge isn't a passion...

27:57.760 --> 28:04.689
...it's a disease that eats at your mind
and poisons your soul.

28:06.400 --> 28:11.406
I attended summer camp
with this little stick of a girl...

28:11.600 --> 28:13.921
...Twila Stansberry.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.043
Hell of an athlete, capture the flag.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.123
Had an unrelenting passion for fitness.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.688
Never skinny enough,
a pound here, a pound there.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.167
Ran like a deer.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.926
Until she couldn't, could barely walk.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.043
Turns out she was anorexic.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.527
The disease caused her
to lose her sight.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.165
I've never known anyone...

28:37.400 --> 28:39.767
...more obsessed with their body
than Twila.

28:39.960 --> 28:44.010
Spent her entire life
chasing something that destroyed her.

28:45.880 --> 28:49.362
Make sure your passion
isn't your sickness.

28:53.360 --> 28:58.321
Your wife is coming apart nicely.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.846
We have a common enemy.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.689
- Who?
- Whoever told you...

29:14.880 --> 29:16.769
...that I killed your daughter.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.121
You are finished with my wife.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.560
Think so?

29:26.880 --> 29:28.962
Yes, you are.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.804
I have something I suspect
you value far more than revenge.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.121
Your money.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.130
What you're telling me
is we have lost control of the situation.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.802
Reddington and the witness are gone.
Berlin, gone. Red's wife, gone.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.243
Can any of you tell me one thing
we've got going for us at this point?

29:47.440 --> 29:49.727
Coffee machine still works.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.046
Uh...

29:51.200 --> 29:53.646
At least it's finally clear now
who our perpetrator really is.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.286
Is it? Illuminate me.

29:56.640 --> 30:00.201
Reddington. He's the one who put
the spotlight on Monarch Douglas.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.091
My guess is because he had
significant funds on deposit.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.926
And once he identified Kaja
as their human hard drive...

30:06.120 --> 30:10.011
He put us on her trail, had us deliver her
into his custody. Double-crossed us.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.527
- Up to something else.
- We need to find that girl.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.643
- Where she's being held.
- She's wounded.

30:14.840 --> 30:18.208
Reddington's going to need to find
her a doctor. Someone he can trust.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.731
Rosa Heredia.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.769
- Who?
- His manicurist.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.367
- Manicurist?
- Well, she was trained as a surgeon.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.927
Of course she was.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.130
Find her. Now.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.809
I have the girl.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.324
And because I have her, I have control
of all your assets at Monarch Douglas.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.001
I've transferred every penny
into a numbered...

30:38.200 --> 30:41.249
...thoroughly untraceable
escrow account. You're broke.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.570
Shh. Listen.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.444
Hear that?

30:48.760 --> 30:51.240
That's the sound
of your checks bouncing.

30:51.440 --> 30:56.082
From here to St. Petersburg,
from Bangkok to Mozambique.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.762
So my proposal, your money...

31:01.000 --> 31:02.684
...for my wife.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.163
You can give her back
and we can continue this war...

31:06.360 --> 31:10.922
...or you can kill my wife
and I keep your money.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.769
I almost gave up looking for you.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.050
You were like a ghost for 12 years.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.403
Heard rumors, and I followed them.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.649
From Barcelona to Melbourne
to Stockholm.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.161
But always nothing.

31:29.400 --> 31:34.725
Until one day, I made a connection.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.331
Elizabeth Keen.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.965
That's why we're sitting here today.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.801
Because of Keen.

31:56.280 --> 32:01.650
I know you care for her
as much as you care for your wife.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.210
I think underneath it all,
under that hat of yours...

32:06.440 --> 32:11.731
...you're not much different
from Twila Stansberry. Heh, heh, heh.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.048
You have the power to destroy me...

32:15.280 --> 32:21.606
...but you're offering me a way out
because you're blinded by passion.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.961
Guess we both are.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.607
Have your associates
set up the meeting.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.529
Okay?

32:50.920 --> 32:53.969
Hey, Rosa.
We know you're treating Kaja.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.567
- Where's your patient?
- L... I don't know...

32:56.760 --> 32:59.411
I came alone.
I don't wanna have to call for backup.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.484
Lizzy. How was your flight?

33:20.720 --> 33:23.849
I know what you're trying to pull,
and it's not gonna happen.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.849
What I'm trying to pull? Is that
how we speak to each other now...

33:28.040 --> 33:30.407
...as if I'm some cheap,
dime-store confidence man?

33:30.600 --> 33:33.126
Bank robber, embezzler, thief.

33:33.360 --> 33:37.081
You put us on this case so you could
get to the girl, steal Berlin's money.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.131
Once she left the bank,
the girl was vulnerable.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.005
I simply took advantage
of an opportunity.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.646
You're gonna use her
to get your wife back.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.411
- Storybook ending.
- Not for the thousands of people...

33:49.600 --> 33:52.331
...who are gonna lose their lives
because of his actions.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.329
This man is a psychopath.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.046
That money is going to fund terror
all over the world.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.846
I'm not gonna let that happen
for the sake of one woman.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.645
You don't have a vote.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.649
I found Kaja.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.003
She gave you the routing numbers.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.726
We froze the escrow accounts
where you parked Berlin's cash.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.159
My wife will die.

34:15.239 --> 34:18.164
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not. Not yet.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.683
Maybe someday, if you're very lucky,
you might wonder:

34:21.880 --> 34:26.487
"At exactly what point did I become
this thing?"

34:26.800 --> 34:30.043
But not now.
Right now, you're just doing your job.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.600
Don't go through with it.
We can find another way.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.801
The deal is moving forward.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.931
You can't hold up your end.
He'll kill you.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.960
Wish me luck.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.365
My wife.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.525

40:19.360 --> 40:24.241
How did you know
that Berlin had his money in that bank?

40:27.960 --> 40:31.521
At first, I thought it was the girl,
that she told you.

40:31.720 --> 40:36.487
But the accounts would be coded,
moved through shell corporations.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.286
Layers of protection.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.960
And then I realized, no.

Somebody has a secret Santa.
