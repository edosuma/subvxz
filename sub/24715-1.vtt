ANDY: <i>Last season on</i> NYPD Blue.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.462
-TONY: What’s this?
-Transfer request.

00:04.587 --> 00:06.423
This is totally out of the blue, Rita.
I mean, why?

00:06.589 --> 00:08.425
I just wanna get back to Brooklyn.
Closer to home.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.593
This have anything to do with you
and Clark?

00:10.760 --> 00:13.888
-No.
-I tell you what. Sleep on it at least.

00:14.639 --> 00:15.765
Okay.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.018
-Judge Eileen Walden.
-ANDY: This your friend, the judge?

00:18.143 --> 00:21.062
(SIGHS) Everything else is on hold,
the food, cake.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.523
I’m just waiting to see
if she’s available.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.275
But this is what you want, right?

00:25.400 --> 00:29.070
If the wedding’s in a church or a shoebox,
it don’t matter to me. I...

00:29.154 --> 00:30.864
I just want the marriage part.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.241
You sure pulled a number on me, didn't ya?
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

00:33.366 --> 00:36.369
Dropped that dime about me sleeping
with a detective in my command.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.830
Or was it Sipowicz who ratted me out?
One of you did.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.332
Captain Fraker, either you leave,
or I make a phone call.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.003
You’re a dirty spic rat, Tony,
and you’re a disgrace to this job!

00:45.170 --> 00:47.589
Okay, now your options are,
either you leave

00:47.672 --> 00:50.258
-or you get your ass kicked.
-You ratted me out!

00:50.467 --> 00:51.551
What’s it gonna be?

01:11.279 --> 01:16.409
On May 20th, Patrick Fraker walked
into the 15th Precinct and fired a shot,

01:16.659 --> 01:19.871
point-blank into the chest
of Lieutenant Tony Rodriguez.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.958
Those facts are undisputed.
The only question is, "Why?"

01:24.375 --> 01:28.421
The evidence will establish the defendant
was a man at the end of his rope.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.715
He had been passed over for a promotion.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.134
His affair with a subordinate
had come to light,

01:33.259 --> 01:36.846
and his wife of 12 years
had just sent him packing.

01:37.055 --> 01:41.768
The evidence will also establish
the defendant blamed Lieutenant Rodriguez

01:41.893 --> 01:44.687
for everything
that had gone wrong in his life.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.733
How do we know this?
Because the defendant said so.

01:49.234 --> 01:53.696
So, he got drunk and went looking
to settle the score with a man he hated.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.367
And he settled it in brutal,
violent fashion.

01:58.034 --> 02:03.540
No cop is above the law, and the swifter
you find the defendant guilty as charged,

02:04.207 --> 02:06.584
the quicker you’ll send that message.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.726
The prosecutor just told you
that Captain Fraker shot Tony Rodriguez.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.605
That’s true.
Now, here’s what she didn’t tell you,

02:27.730 --> 02:31.192
she didn’t tell you that Captain Fraker
is a highly decorated officer,

02:31.276 --> 02:34.195
who spent 18 years
putting away dirty cops.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.991
She didn’t tell you that the 15th Precinct
is a hotbed of corruption.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.326
And she didn’t tell you
that on the day in question,

02:40.410 --> 02:43.496
Captain Fraker
had announced IAB investigations

02:43.580 --> 02:46.958
that would've brought down
Tony Rodriguez’s command.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.920
The mayor, the DA... everybody wants you
to hear a story about one bad cop

02:51.129 --> 02:54.257
instead of a precinct of bad cops.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.803
But the great thing about a trial
is that the truth comes out.

02:59.387 --> 03:03.266
You’ll hear how Tony Rodriguez went
for his gun first in an effort to silence

03:03.349 --> 03:07.520
his loudest critic, and you’ll conclude
that the wrong man is on trial today.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.690
The only thing Captain Fraker
is guilty of is doing his job.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.402
What he deserves is not a conviction,
but a commendation.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.197
You wanna send a message?

03:18.364 --> 03:19.574
Send that one.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.301
-What we got?
-Alex Langford, one in the chest.

03:38.968 --> 03:42.055
His brother Freddie lives here too.
Perp got him in the arm.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.683
I just heard. (EXHALES)
Fraker’s claimin' self-defense?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.144
-Yeah. (SCOFFS) It’s a Hail Mary.
-Not now, Medavoy.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.772
I’d have bet anything he’d have gone
for temporary insanity.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.608
-He didn’t. Go start a canvass.
-Hey, can you give us a second?

03:54.817 --> 03:57.528
Detectives Sipowicz and Clark.
Sorry about your brother.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.155
-Yeah.
-What happened?

03:59.530 --> 04:02.909
Uh... I’m in my room, reading, bell rings.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.246
I hear a guy yell, "Rot in hell,"
and then a... a gunshot.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.413
How’d you get shot?

04:07.538 --> 04:10.416
I ran out here, right when the guy
was about to run off.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.379
-He looked at me, fired his gun.
-You get a good look at his face?

04:14.837 --> 04:16.798
-He had a mask.
-Just you and your brother here?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.884
-Yeah, I moved in two months ago.
-Anyone have a beef with him?

04:19.968 --> 04:22.512
I d... I don't... I don't know,
I c... I can't even think right now.

04:22.679 --> 04:27.934
-He owe money, maybe girlfriend problems?
-I don’t think so. Um... (CHUCKLES)

04:28.726 --> 04:30.395
There’s this other thing, though.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.022
-Um...
-What?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.942
I’m, uh... I’m a registered sex offender

04:36.109 --> 04:38.152
falsely accused,
but apparently that doesn't matter

04:38.278 --> 04:40.196
'cause I’ve been
getting hassled since I got out of prison.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.533
I want you to know that up-front
in case this was somebody comin' after me.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.704
-I... I don't know, I can barely think.
-Like, what are we talking about, Freddie?

04:48.705 --> 04:49.914
This was, um...

04:50.999 --> 04:53.167
this was left under my door last night.

04:57.588 --> 05:01.301
"Freddie Langford in 4-B,
is a convicted felon who rapes children."

05:02.135 --> 05:03.344
Any idea who sent this?

05:03.594 --> 05:05.805
Probably one of the dads
of the kids who accused me.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.391
-How many kids are we talking about?
-Two.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.394
I don’t know if it’s related to Alex
getting killed, but...

05:12.562 --> 05:14.897
(CRIES)

05:17.275 --> 05:19.902
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

06:18.378 --> 06:20.797
(THEME MUSIC CONCLUDING)

06:27.095 --> 06:28.638
-Against who?
-How is he?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.432
Focused. All business.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.063
-TONY: What we got?
-JOHN: Uh... Nothing past

06:37.146 --> 06:39.023
what the brother gave us,
neighbors heard shots,

06:39.148 --> 06:41.025
-didn’t see anything.
-DOA got a sheet?

06:41.150 --> 06:44.320
No, he’s clean. Uh... I called his work.
He was a machinist in Brooklyn.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.241
He filed assault charges a few years back
against a coworker, uh, Brad Riggs.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.159
-He’s comin' in.
-Uh... We’ll take him.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.204
What’s this I hear on the deal
with his brother, Freddie. Sex offender?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.206
Yeah, yeah, he claims he was railroaded.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.835
Uh... Regardless, he thinks somebody
from his past might have been gunning for.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.130
Well, he did eight years, got out
18 months ago. Both of his victims

07:02.255 --> 07:04.215
were pre-teen males
where he taught school.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.675
-TONY: How old are they now?
-Late teens.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.886
So, the shooter maybe killed
Freddie’s brother by mistake?

07:09.053 --> 07:11.514
Yeah, that’s what we’re gonna talk
to him about. Radio car’s bringin' him in

07:11.597 --> 07:12.974
-from Bellevue now.
-RITA: Uh...

07:13.057 --> 07:16.018
I need to get down to court.
I’m testifying this mornin'.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.354
-TONY: Good luck.
-RITA: Thanks.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.985
JOHN IRVIN: 15th squad.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.572
Um... Detective,
Freddie Langford’s on his way up.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.745
If Freddie gives us anything
on Brad Riggs, we’ll give you a heads-up.

07:34.829 --> 07:35.955
BALDWIN: Yeah, good.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.545
You know a Brad Riggs?

07:44.839 --> 07:47.592
Freddie, do you know a Brad Riggs?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.178
Uh... Sorry, they gave me some pain pills.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.306
Yeah, that’s someone
my brother used to work with,

07:53.389 --> 07:55.475
-they didn’t get along too good.
-Why not?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.810
-Uh... Workplace stuff.
-Nothin' about you?

07:58.269 --> 08:00.146
Maybe?
Alex wouldn’t have told me if it was.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.773
’Cause this Riggs busted up
your brother pretty good.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.402
I didn’t know that.
Alex was pretty protective of me.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.322
Now, let's get back to this mornin'.
"Rot in hell."

08:09.489 --> 08:11.657
-Why’d you think that was meant for you?
-I’m saying it could’ve been.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.159
You recognize the voice?

08:13.534 --> 08:18.080
No, but I recognize the tone, the anger...
they all have it.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.666
Whoa, whoa, who’s "they"?
Let's... let’s start getting specific.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.710
The fathers of the kids who accused me.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.712
Who left the flyer under your door
last night?

08:24.837 --> 08:27.673
Probably Ray Wilentz.
He’s been harassing me since I got out.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.842
-More than the flyer?
-Flyers, letters.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.762
He’s led pickets outside the places
I’ve lived until I was evicted.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.140
-He won't leave me alone.
-Uh... If this Wilentz is that obsessed

08:36.224 --> 08:38.643
with you,
how does he shoot your brother by mistake?

08:38.851 --> 08:41.812
Uh... Me and my brother look alike.
I... I don’t know.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.232
Believe me, I hope it was this coworker
you’re talking about.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.192
Because if whoever killed Alex,
was after me,

08:46.400 --> 08:48.569
I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.197
We’re gonna need the names
of the boys you molested.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.365
I didn’t molest anybody.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.076
Fine. Write down the names, anyway,
along with anybody else

08:55.159 --> 08:56.536
who you think’s got it out for you.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.081
I volunteered my own time
to tutor these kids,

09:00.414 --> 09:04.001
and when I busted 'em for stealing my CDs,
they cook up these lies about molesting

09:04.126 --> 09:06.420
to keep from getting in trouble
with their parents. And when the DA...

09:06.504 --> 09:09.257
We’re not here to retry your case,
Freddie. Do you understand?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.677
Yeah. Yeah.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.430
(PEN CLICKING, SCRAPING)

09:20.226 --> 09:23.020
-You wanna tell me why I’m here now?
-Sure. Sit down.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.358
Alex Langford. That’s what this is about.

09:28.442 --> 09:31.612
-Do I need a lawyer in here?
-Why would you need a lawyer, Brad?

09:32.029 --> 09:34.198
’Cause the last time I got mixed up
with Alex Langford, it almost cost me

09:34.323 --> 09:37.326
-my job and time in prison.
-This is when you assaulted him at work.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.829
BRAD: There's no assault,
those charges were dismissed.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.707
-GREG: What happened?
-Why am I here? Or I get a lawyer.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.292
Alex got attacked this morning.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.168
-And he said I did it?
-BALDWIN: No, he doesn’t know.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.005
We’re having friendly conversations
with people he had beefs with.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.674
Now, if they wanna make it unfriendly,
we’ll be happy to take it

09:51.757 --> 09:53.175
to the next level.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.847
-Why did you assault him three months ago?
-Look, like I told the DA back when,

09:58.055 --> 10:00.182
I work the lathe on Tuesdays,
he works the band saw.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.518
We had a misunderstanding
about the schedule.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.814
Broken nose, busted lip.
All because of a schedule mix-up?

10:06.981 --> 10:09.609
Pretty much.
That’s the last time I touched the guy.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.320
And this argument had nothin'
to do with Alex’s brother?

10:12.486 --> 10:14.405
You know,
since we’re talking man-to-man here,

10:14.488 --> 10:15.990
I don’t like child molesters. Right?

10:16.115 --> 10:19.327
I got two kids at home. I made that known
to Alex. He said what he said,

10:19.410 --> 10:21.996
and I guess I factored that
into the scheduling conflict.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.831
And that’s the only time
the two of you mixed it up?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.458
-Absolutely.
-GREG: We’re not gonna hear different

10:25.541 --> 10:26.667
from coworkers?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.837
I don't like the guy, okay?
His brother’s a scumbag pedophile.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.882
Now, if you think I don’t have a right
to be disgusted by that, too bad.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.008
You didn’t answer my question.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.302
All right, maybe we had to get separated
a couple of times on the floor

10:36.385 --> 10:38.721
-but nothin' official.
-Hey, you got a temper problem, Brad?

10:38.888 --> 10:40.848
No, what I got is ten minutes left
on my lunch hour.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.725
Now, I told you what the deal
with Alex is.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.435
Now, he’ll tell you the same
if he’s a half a man.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.604
He’s dead, Brad!

10:46.937 --> 10:51.150
-(SIGHS) Huh. You cops, man. I knew it.
-All right, your whereabouts this morning.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.070
I punched the clock at 8:00 sharp.
The timecard will tell you.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.113
Yeah, anybody human to verify that?

10:56.238 --> 10:57.823
I don’t know, and I don’t care.
I want a lawyer.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.492
That’s telling us to look at you
extra hard.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.868
Lawyer.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.877
I was returning from the coffee room,
then I heard the shot.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.589
-What did you see?
-Captain Fraker, standing with his gun

11:13.673 --> 11:16.050
pointed at Lieutenant Rodriguez
who was on the ground.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.844
He was advancing toward the lieutenant
in a threatening manner,

11:18.928 --> 11:21.639
-so I discharged my weapon.
-What did you do next?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.809
RITA: I entered the office and took
Captain Fraker’s gun.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.728
Then I began administering first aid
to Lieutenant Rodriguez.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.855
Did you handcuff the defendant?

11:30.106 --> 11:33.484
I would've, but there was no need.
He was clearly incapacitated.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.779
-And did you say anything to him?
-Yes. I said, "What did you do?"

11:36.904 --> 11:40.074
-Did the defendant respond?
-He said he wasn’t sorry,

11:40.366 --> 11:42.201
that Rodriguez got what he deserved.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.663
-Nothing further.
-Your witness, Mr. Sinclair.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.628
Detective, did you question Captain Fraker
before or after anyone else

11:52.712 --> 11:54.714
-entered the office?
-Before.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.258
To your knowledge, did he say anything
with other people present?

11:57.466 --> 11:58.467
Not that I know of.

11:58.592 --> 12:02.179
So, he has a habit of blurting out things
only when you two are alone.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.306
-Objection.
-Sustained.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.559
JAMES: Detective,
you testified you heard the gunshot.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.269
Did you see the shooting?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.396
-No.
-JAMES: So, you couldn’t say

12:10.563 --> 12:12.773
if Lieutenant Rodriguez reached
for his gun first. Could you?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.484
-That’s ridiculous.
-Would the court please instruct

12:15.568 --> 12:18.696
-the witness to answer the question?
-EDGAR: Detective...

12:19.363 --> 12:20.531
(RITA SIGHS)

12:21.240 --> 12:23.367
-No, I couldn’t, but I...
-JAMES: Thank you.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.328
You also say that you discharged
your weapon

12:26.495 --> 12:28.080
because Captain Fraker was advancing

12:28.164 --> 12:30.791
towards Lieutenant Rodriguez
in a threatening manner, right?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.544
-Yes.
-What constitutes a threatening manner?

12:33.711 --> 12:34.920
His gun was drawn.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.256
He was pointing it
at Lieutenant Rodriguez.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.426
And you assumed
what about Captain Fraker’s intentions?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.804
That he was preparing
to shoot Lieutenant Rodriguez again.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.432
But since Lieutenant Rodriguez
went for his gun first...

12:46.515 --> 12:49.727
Objection! Assuming facts
that are not in evidence.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.272
Sustained. Counsel, please don’t argue
your case through this witness.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.523
Certainly, Your Honor.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.860
We’ll hear from Captain Fraker soon enough
to set the record straight.

12:57.943 --> 13:02.323
So, Detective, if Lieutenant Rodriguez
reached for his gun first,

13:02.573 --> 13:05.409
based on your training,
wouldn’t Captain Fraker

13:05.534 --> 13:08.829
advancing toward Lieutenant Rodriguez
with gun drawn

13:09.163 --> 13:11.457
-be prudent?
-There’s no way that happened.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.709
Detective, I’m asking you
a yes-or-no question.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.337
In a fictional scenario like that, sure.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.298
JAMES: So, when you testified earlier
that Captain Fraker said,

13:19.590 --> 13:22.301
"Lieutenant Rodriguez got
what he deserved,"

13:22.468 --> 13:24.804
you don’t know
what that was in reference to, do you?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.680
That he shot someone he hated.

13:26.847 --> 13:30.392
Did Captain Fraker say that,
or is that an assumption on your part?

13:30.601 --> 13:35.272
-He didn’t say those exact words, but...
-Detective, did you witness

13:35.439 --> 13:39.652
what transpired between Captain Fraker
and Lieutenant Rodriguez

13:39.735 --> 13:42.154
prior to hearing the gunshot?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.156
No.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.826
You just shot first
and asked questions later.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.245
-Objection.
-Withdrawn. Nothing further.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.871
Redirect, Your Honor.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.752
Detective, when you came upon the scene,

13:57.294 --> 14:01.048
was Lieutenant Rodriguez’s gun holstered
or unholstered?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.175
-Holstered.
-VALERIE: Thank you.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.969
No further questions, Detective.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.514
-EDGAR: The witness may step down.
-RITA: Thank you, Your Honor.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.238
-Hey, John.
-How’d it go, Detective?

14:24.321 --> 14:25.489
Hard to say.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.536
I read an article regarding jury behavior,
and apparently, uh, nonverbal cues

14:30.619 --> 14:33.330
like folded arms
or the clenching of the jaw

14:33.581 --> 14:36.375
can give you a possible indication
of what they think of the testimony.

14:36.458 --> 14:41.088
Eventually, they actually do it verbally,
indicating exactly what they think.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.216
-And that’s the only part that matters.
-Of course.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.427
-Everything okay?
-Sure.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.054
So, where we at?

14:49.138 --> 14:52.349
We checked up on the DOA's coworker,
Brad Riggs, but he lawyered up.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.561
Yeah. Time clock says he was in
at 8:00, but nobody can verify.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.563
-We’re still looking into him.
-You found any of the victims

14:57.646 --> 15:00.149
-the brother gave you?
-One of the dads, "Ray Wilentz."

15:00.232 --> 15:03.027
-Works at the Fulton Fish Market.
-We’re gonna head down there, talk to him.

15:03.110 --> 15:06.906
-TONY: What about the other kid?
-Mickey Economides is still in the area,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.198
shuttling between foster homes.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.118
His current foster mom paged him for us,
so he’s on his way in.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.413
-Rita and I will take him.
-Rita, you got a second?

15:14.747 --> 15:15.998
Sure.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.010
-So, no surprises?
-I said what happened.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.261
Fraker’s guy tried to twist it.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.097
You were late on the scene.
I went for my gun first.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.016
-Yeah.
-(SIGHS)

15:36.393 --> 15:39.146
So, it took a few days, but I finally
got caught up on my paperwork,

15:39.229 --> 15:41.190
and, uh, I found the transfer request

15:41.273 --> 15:42.900
you gave me before this whole thing
went down.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.945
(SIGHS) Issues I may have had back then,
they’re behind me.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.281
-So, are you staying?
-I’d like to, yeah.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.702
Thanks.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.121
That’s the least I can do
for the girl who saved my life.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.207
This all gonna work out, Lieutenant.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.002

16:10.970 --> 16:13.639
Oh, and, um, it’s pronounced,

Yeah, I know. "He don’t look Greek."
Well, my first foster folks were.

Hey, it could be worse.
I once lived with the Berklebacks,

16:20.145 --> 16:23.440
Mickey Berkleback. Hmm?
No thanks. (CHUCKLES)

16:23.524 --> 16:25.526
So, you’ve been in the circuit
since you were a baby?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.778
I make the best of it, you know?

16:28.112 --> 16:33.158
Mickey, uh, we’ve gotta ask you something,
and it may not be easy to talk about.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.702
Okay.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.580
-When did you last see Freddie Langford?
-Oh, uh... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

16:38.789 --> 16:42.042
...I guess at the trial. Yeah. Why?

16:42.334 --> 16:46.046
Well, Langford was assaulted,
and part of what we have to do for our job

16:46.130 --> 16:48.132
is talk to people who didn’t like him.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.135
(SCOFFS)
Well, I didn’t do anything to him,

16:51.218 --> 16:53.512
and he didn’t really do anything to me.
It was more the DA

16:53.595 --> 16:55.305
that kinda lumped me in
with that other kid,

16:55.389 --> 16:56.640
’cause all Mr. Langford did

16:56.724 --> 16:58.809
was just show me some pictures
and touch himself.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.895
Well, we read the file,
and that’s not what you said back then.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.648
I'm tellin' you. They made it look like
more happened to me than what really did,

17:04.732 --> 17:06.567
because I’m no fag. (CHUCKLES)

17:07.276 --> 17:09.778
-Where were you this morning?
-At school.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.530
We checked school, and you didn’t show.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.283
I was more just hanging out
instead of goin' to class.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.702
Can anyone verify
that you were hangin' out?

17:16.827 --> 17:18.954
Yeah, I mean,
guys don’t really know me there,

17:19.121 --> 17:21.957
’cause you know, I’ve only been
at that school for a couple of weeks,

17:22.041 --> 17:25.044
but they’d recognize me.
I mean, someone should recognize me.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.213
So we’re gonna be able to find someone
who will tell us that you were there

17:28.297 --> 17:31.258
-at 8:00 a.m.? That's all we need.
-I... I... I don’t know what time

17:31.467 --> 17:32.968
I got there. I mean, I don’t have a watch.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.554

is where you were this mornin’.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.222

Anywhere but that stupid school
and that stupid retard class

17:40.934 --> 17:42.269

17:42.478 --> 17:44.980
Put yourself in our shoes, Mickey.
Imagine what that sounds like.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.566
I don’t care what it sounds like.
It’s the truth.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.028
And besides, why would I wanna hurt
Mr. Langford? I’m over it.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.281
What happened
at your last foster home, Mickey?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.285
Me and the Christens
just didn’t get along.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.205
-They were too strict.
-Well, the report says you were kicked out

18:01.288 --> 18:03.874
for touching
your seven-year-old foster brother.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.503
No one’s blaming you.
You’re acting out, that’s on Langford.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.273

My counselor says I’m not supposed to go
to places where little kids are,

18:31.735 --> 18:34.029
but all I was doing was playing games.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.656
Look, I swear.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.867
All right. We’ll check it out.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.836
And did you have occasion
to treat Captain Fraker that afternoon?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.256
Yes. He was brought into the ER
with a gunshot wound to his spine

18:52.339 --> 18:55.843
at about 6:15. I stabilized him,
and he was sent to neurosurgery.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.594
-VALERIE: Did you draw his blood?
-JENNIFER: I did.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.389
Perp procedure of the sample was sent
to our lab for analysis.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.558
And what were the results
of that analysis?

19:02.683 --> 19:06.186
Mr. Fraker’s blood alcohol content
registered .25.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.941
And in your expert medical opinion,
would that BAC be sufficient

19:11.066 --> 19:14.361
to impair the motor skills of a man
of the defendant’s height and weight?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.281
-Absolutely.
-So, the speed at which one could...

19:17.573 --> 19:20.284
for example, reach for a gun,
would that be impacted?

19:20.409 --> 19:22.786
Hand-eye coordination
would be substantially diminished.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.249
So, in your opinion,
if a man as intoxicated as Captain Fraker

19:27.332 --> 19:29.668
saw a sober man draw his own gun,

19:29.918 --> 19:32.546
would Captain Fraker be able
to outdraw the sober man?

19:32.713 --> 19:37.759
Objection. Speculation.
This is a medical witness, not a cowgirl.

-Sustained.

Dr. Devlin, during the course
of your treatment of the defendant,

19:42.973 --> 19:46.476
-did he say anything to you?
-He said, "I hope the bastard’s dead."

19:46.685 --> 19:49.479
-He kept repeating that.
-Thank you.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.359
Dr. Devlin, were you present

19:54.443 --> 19:56.528
during the original altercation
in the squad room

19:56.612 --> 19:58.238
between Captain Fraker
and Lieutenant Rodriguez?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.616
-No.
-So, you don’t know when Captain Fraker

20:00.699 --> 20:04.077
said, "I hope the bastard is dead,"
what or who or any of the circumstances

20:04.203 --> 20:06.121
-that was in regard to?
-No, but I...

-That’s too bad.
-Now, see, Ray, talk like that

21:23.907 --> 21:26.076
don’t help us eliminate you as a suspect.

-you been through a lot with this guy.

No. What's going on here?

23:11.515 --> 23:14.059
-Someone hurt him.
-And you think it was me?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.896
-We’re talking to a lot of people.
-Where were you this morning?

23:18.230 --> 23:22.442
Touring NYU with my mom. Uh...
Last week was Brown, next week’s Cornell.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.528
I haven’t seen that guy in eight years,

23:24.820 --> 23:26.196
n... not since the trial.

23:26.279 --> 23:29.116
We know this is difficult
and we’re not looking to dredge stuff up.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.159
Sooner you answer our questions,
the sooner you’re out of here.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.411
I didn’t do anything.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.663
All right, have you been in touch
with him?

23:35.455 --> 23:36.665
He’s been in touch.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.876
He started sending me letters
a few months ago out of the blue.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.420
-(ANDY SIGHING)
-What did they say?

23:41.586 --> 23:43.004
Well, I only read the first one,

23:43.171 --> 23:45.757
but he was asking
if we could put the past behind us,

23:45.841 --> 23:49.928
if I could get my dad to leave him alone,
but he still won’t admit what he did.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.638
He still won’t apologize.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.974
Did your dad find out about these letters?

23:54.391 --> 23:57.352
By accident. (INHALES)
My dad came by to pick me up,

23:57.477 --> 23:59.688
and my mom left the mail
on the kitchen table.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.148
JOHN: What was his reaction?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.983
He didn’t threaten him,
if that’s what you mean.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.152
Okay, he got a little angry,
which you can understand

24:05.277 --> 24:08.280
-and then he calmed down.
-You know where your dad was this morning?

24:08.613 --> 24:10.949
Work. I don’t know. I live with my mom.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.285
My dad would never hurt anyone.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.162
So, you were aware
he’s been hounding Langford?

24:15.370 --> 24:19.040
I don’t think that keeping other kids safe
is necessarily a wrong thing.

24:19.207 --> 24:22.294
Adam, if your dad did something
and you have some information...

24:22.461 --> 24:24.379
Look, I have been through a lot.

24:25.380 --> 24:28.300
Meds, therapy three times a week.

24:28.383 --> 24:31.136
-(SIGHS)
-Looks like you got past it. Did your dad?

24:32.053 --> 24:33.221
I’m an only son.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.642
He... he blamed himself
for not keeping a closer watch.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.644
And you don’t think
he could have hurt Langford?

24:39.769 --> 24:42.022
I didn’t do anything,
and neither did my dad.

24:42.272 --> 24:46.067
That guy ruined our lives.
Can’t you please just leave us alone?

24:48.612 --> 24:51.448
Yeah, soon as we eliminate you
as a suspect, okay?

24:51.698 --> 24:54.075
It’ll help if you write down
who you and your mom spoke to

24:54.159 --> 24:56.161
this morning at NYU.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.954
ADAM: Whatever you guys need.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.874
Nothing about that guy
means anything to me now.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.050
-Anything from the kid?
-We’ll check his alibi,

25:10.133 --> 25:12.219
but he seems solid.
Or he did before we brought up

25:12.302 --> 25:13.553
Freddie Langford’s name.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.348
Rubbing salt in these people’s wounds
has been a real highlight today.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.600
So, Freddie was bullshitting with his
claim that he didn't molest these kids?

25:18.767 --> 25:20.435
A jury put him away.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.605
Mickey Economides, the other kid,
Freddie molested, he checked out.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.774
So he was at the arcade
where he wasn't supposes to be?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.651
Yeah. And I got his counselor hit.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.986
Uh... When you talked to Freddie earlier,

25:30.111 --> 25:32.697
did he mention why his brother
called Freddie’s parole officer?

25:33.031 --> 25:34.199
Didn’t come up. Why?

25:34.407 --> 25:36.493
Oh. The Langford’s phone dump
just came back.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.204
Freddie’s brother put in a call
to the PO early this morning,

25:39.287 --> 25:42.249
a half-hour before the shooting.
So, I called the PO.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.377
He said Freddie’s brother left a message
saying he needed to talk to him,

25:45.752 --> 25:48.630
-nothing more.
-Wh... and that didn’t raise the PO up?

25:48.838 --> 25:50.757
No, he’d heard
from Freddie’s brother before. So,

25:50.924 --> 25:53.718
-the call wasn’t unusual.
-Yeah, but the timing is.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.220
Get Freddie back in here now.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.645
We’re investigating
this as aggressive as possible.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.729
Thank you.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.565
ANDY: We’re talking to a lot of people
from your past,

26:06.731 --> 26:09.776
-and it’s very painful to them.
-Well, it’s painful for me, too.

26:09.859 --> 26:13.363
What we need to know, Freddie,
what we need to be certain of,

26:13.655 --> 26:15.991
-is that you’re telling us everything.
-I am.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.077
So, the letters to Adam Wilentz,
that must've just slipped your mind.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.080
I was trying to get his dad off my back
for something I never did,

26:22.163 --> 26:23.498
and Adam knows that.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.960
I didn’t tell you guys
because it’s a parole violation.

26:27.043 --> 26:29.546
Okay, now,
keeping in mind what I just told you,

26:30.297 --> 26:32.507
what else have you left out
for whatever reason?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.801
Nothing, I swear.
Just the letters to Adam.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.012
We used to be friends.
I considered him a son.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.306
Okay, we search your place,
we gonna find anything else

26:39.389 --> 26:41.266
-that would violate your parole?
-No, hell no.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.143
'Cause your brother called
your parole officer

26:43.226 --> 26:45.145
this morning' a half-hour
before he got shot.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.230
-Yes.
-Why didn’t you tell us that?

26:47.314 --> 26:48.982
'Cause it had nothing to do with it.

26:49.441 --> 26:53.111
I realize you have a certain opinion
of me, like everybody else

26:53.194 --> 26:55.614
but you’re letting it get in the way
of finding who killed my brother.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.741
Do us a favor,
don’t tell us how to do our jobs.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.159
I'm just saying you’re wasting your time

26:59.284 --> 27:01.202
-talking to me.
-Explain the phone call to your PO.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.956
I was feeling really down this morning
because of the flyer Ray Wilentz left.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.834
I saw myself having to move again
and reregistering.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.795
Alex said how proud he was of me
for keeping it together.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.423
I said it would be nice if my PO felt
the same way.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.091
He offered to call
and sing my praise a little.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.927
So, your brother wasn’t calling
to report something you did,

27:18.094 --> 27:20.055
-something you shouldn’t have been doing?
-Like what?

27:20.221 --> 27:24.017
-Like writing to your victims, for one.
-FREDDIE: They weren’t my victims.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.436
Alex didn’t know about that.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.896
JOHN: Things just
aren’t coming together, Freddie.

27:28.104 --> 27:32.067
We got inconsistencies, omissions,
a masked man only you saw.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.653
To be honest,
I expected a little bias here.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.072
Which is why I brought my history up
right away, hoping my honesty

27:37.155 --> 27:40.241
-would get you past it
-What happened this morning, Freddie?

27:40.575 --> 27:43.745
I told you. My brother was murdered.
I was shot.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.538
I’m a victim here,
whether you like it or not.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.458
If it comes out that you are keeping
anything else from us…

27:48.541 --> 27:50.752
Can I please go arrange the burial
of my brother now?

27:51.586 --> 27:52.796
Go ahead.

28:03.723 --> 28:04.933
JOHN: Okay, thanks.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.643
He explain the call to his parole officer?

28:06.726 --> 28:07.727
JOHN: Kinda.

28:08.436 --> 28:11.272
Where’s Freddie’s file? There’s this thing
about going to see his grandmother

28:11.439 --> 28:12.440
every week.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.694
Yeah, Freddie’s been, uh, charging up
bus tickets to Clifton, New Jersey,

28:15.777 --> 28:18.321
-on his credit card.
-Yeah, but to see his grandmother, right?

28:18.405 --> 28:20.365
-GREG: That's what it says.
-Can we confirm that?

28:20.490 --> 28:21.991
Her phone’s been busy each time
I’ve called.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.828
It’s worth a ride out there
'cause I don't trust this prick

28:25.036 --> 28:26.246
Sure.

28:33.378 --> 28:37.298
-Haywood will call when she needs you.
-Yeah, I’m... I’m just checking the time.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.637
(CLEARS THROAT) After this trial’s over
and the microscope’s off us,

28:42.762 --> 28:44.097
we can get back to normal.

28:44.764 --> 28:45.807
We’re fine.

28:45.932 --> 28:49.978
I’m talking about certain,
you know, uh, matrimonial plans.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.815
-I know what you’re talking about.
-Yeah, right after this trial’s over.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.486
I just talked to a coworker
of Ray Wilentz down at the fish market.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.948
He says two weeks ago, Ray asked him
if he knew where to get a gun.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.794
So, did you guys prove
I was at the park this morning,

29:14.878 --> 29:18.339
or do you have to, you know,
dust my boots for pigeon crap?

29:19.466 --> 29:21.676
Oh, the bodega owner puts
you there at 8:30.

29:22.343 --> 29:26.055
-Okay. So, why am I here?
-JOHN: Shooting went down at 9:00.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.227
So, you don’t believe me. Great.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.856
-What's next?
-You being honest, and us helping you out.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.900
-I've been honest.
-We know you found out

29:36.983 --> 29:38.693
about the letters Freddie sent
to your son.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.153
-So?
-ANDY: So the hunch here is,

29:40.278 --> 29:43.907
-that you didn’t take that sittin' down.
-How I felt is how I felt,

29:44.032 --> 29:45.950
and that’s none of your damn business.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.286
As far as what I did when I saw
those letters,

29:48.369 --> 29:52.081
nothing beyond what I can lawfully do
to that guy. Same thing I've been doing.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.250
Is that when you started looking
to get a gun?

29:55.126 --> 29:56.753
-Who’s saying that?
-We are.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.046
Did you get a gun, Ray?

29:58.713 --> 30:01.341
If this guy twists it so that I end up
in jail...

30:01.424 --> 30:04.177
If we search your place,
are we gonna find a gun?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.764
Not the one that killed your guy.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.141
-Go ahead and check it.
-We will.

30:10.225 --> 30:13.603
But you having one to begin with says
to us, that you might have had another.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.231
If I was gonna kill that son of a bitch,

30:16.606 --> 30:19.484
I would have done it eight years ago
on the courthouse steps.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.820
At least then I’d be able to sleep
through the night,

30:22.028 --> 30:25.532
-I’d be able to look at my son in the eye.
-Then why’d you get the gun?

30:26.533 --> 30:29.202
Some days, I kid myself... (EXHALES)

30:29.953 --> 30:32.497
(INHALES)
...I get the balls to take him out.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.626
Some days, I just want to take myself out.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.673
(SIGHS)

30:44.133 --> 30:46.094
I just want this... (CLEARS THROAT)
...just want this to end.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.972
All right, now is the time to work it out
if you had any involvement, Ray.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.056
RAY: I told you the truth.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.101
Now, I'm done talking about him.

31:06.739 --> 31:10.785
I remember this one time they cut out
all these pictures from magazines,

31:10.869 --> 31:12.245
and drew in the...

31:13.329 --> 31:14.998
-Uh... Captions.
-Captions.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.666
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

31:16.749 --> 31:20.295
And they had this one
of this green tree frog

31:20.378 --> 31:25.675
with a worm hanging out of his mouth.
And the caption was, "Mm, needs salt."

31:26.050 --> 31:27.844
-(LAUGHING)
-(CHUCKLES)

31:28.469 --> 31:30.430
They were so cute.

31:30.847 --> 31:34.392
Well, um,
Alex is in a better place now, ma’am.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.768
Amen.

31:35.852 --> 31:39.689
Uh... So, uh, Freddie comes to visit you
once a week?

31:39.772 --> 31:43.318
GRACE: I remember this one time
it lasted two weeks.

31:43.943 --> 31:47.030
Freddie only wanted to speak in rhymes.

31:47.196 --> 31:50.867
And you know
what word finally tripped him up?

31:51.326 --> 31:52.452
"Orange."

31:52.535 --> 31:55.622
So, Freddie comes to visit you
once a week. Is that right?

31:55.705 --> 31:59.334
That’s Freddie when he...
when he went to Grand Canyon.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.379
Ma’am, does Freddie come to visit you
once a week?

32:03.504 --> 32:06.090
He brings barley soup
from Fourth Street Deli.

32:06.257 --> 32:09.427
So, that’s a yes. Uh...
Every week for the last couple of months?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.304
Yes.

32:11.679 --> 32:15.767
GREG: Well, uh, thank you for your time,
ma’am. We’ll just let ourselves out.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.939
Freddie didn’t do those things.
The boys lied.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.067
-The parents lied. The lawyers lied.
-Is that what happened?

32:24.192 --> 32:26.945
Someone was running for political office,
and they didn’t wanna look soft

32:27.028 --> 32:30.448
-on crime.
-Uh... Well, thanks again.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.617
And, uh, take care of yourself, ma’am.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.496
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(BALDWIN SIGHS)

32:36.579 --> 32:38.957
You get so caught up on how he raped kids

32:39.040 --> 32:42.043
that you forget what a sweetheart
Freddie was to his grandmother.

32:42.251 --> 32:43.795
Yeah, a real good guy.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.714
Hey, Baldwin. How'd we miss this?

32:48.508 --> 32:50.802
Hey, you know what, I think we need to go
ask grandma for one of those pictures

32:50.885 --> 32:52.178
of Freddie on the mantle.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.187
-(KIDS CLAMORING)
-Yeah, go ahead, dumpling.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.315
And no hanging upside down this time.
You are not a bat.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.943
Good afternoon, ma’am.
Uh... Detectives Jones, Medavoy.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.361
Can I help you?

33:08.444 --> 33:11.030
Yes, uh, have you ever seen this guy
hang around here?

33:11.197 --> 33:13.116
-Oh, sure. That’s Malcolm.
-Malcolm?

33:13.533 --> 33:15.201
Yeah, he’s a grounds keeper.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.204
You know, rakes out the sandbox,
cleans up. (CHUCKLES)

33:18.496 --> 33:22.000
-I... is there a problem?
-Um... How often does he come by?

33:22.291 --> 33:23.292
Every so often.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.753
Grounds keeper. So he has a uniform?

33:25.878 --> 33:28.214
Green coveralls, a cap,
that sort of thing.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.842
Uh... Does he interact with the kids much?

33:31.050 --> 33:32.719
Oh, yeah. The kids love him.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.223
Um... What’s the problem?
What’s going on?

33:37.348 --> 33:39.267
Oh, it’s just a misunderstanding.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.020
-Is there something I should worry about?
-Uh... No, not at all.

33:42.145 --> 33:47.108
But uh, until we straighten this out,
um, if he does come by again,

33:47.191 --> 33:49.235
-just give us a call, okay?
-Okay.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.361
Thanks.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.121
Sit.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.333
Here’s what we know about you, Freddie.

34:05.585 --> 34:08.588
You molested those two boys,
eight years ago.

34:08.671 --> 34:10.715
-I did not. (GROANS)
-Then you lied about it,

34:10.798 --> 34:14.052
forcing those boys to take the stand
and recount every detail.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.095
And then today,
you lied about what happened

34:16.262 --> 34:17.847
and dragged everybody through it again.

34:17.930 --> 34:20.224
People who were trying to get on
with their lives. People you should have

34:20.308 --> 34:21.517
let get on with their lives.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.645
You may not have told the truth
ever in your life, Freddie,

34:24.771 --> 34:27.190
but you will in this room right now.

34:28.191 --> 34:30.318
I swear to God,
I have been telling the truth.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.488
There’s another lie right there...
Malcolm!

34:36.240 --> 34:37.617
It’s not what you think.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.453
ANDY: Despite it all, Freddie,
I’m gonna do you a favor.

34:40.536 --> 34:43.539
I'm going to give you a cha…
Hey, hey! You listening to me?

34:43.623 --> 34:46.501
I am gonna give you a chance to be a man
for once in your life

34:46.667 --> 34:48.044
to tell the truth or...

34:48.711 --> 34:50.671
you lunge for Detective Clark’s gun.

34:52.673 --> 34:54.383
-I wouldn’t do that.
-I’ll say you did.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.511
You’ll put us
in a life-threatening situation,

34:56.594 --> 34:58.221
and we’ll have to react.

34:58.304 --> 35:02.683
And when I tell you it makes
no difference to me which one you do,

35:02.934 --> 35:04.310
you believe it.

35:05.478 --> 35:08.314
No... (CHOKES) Wait! Wait!
(BREATHES HEAVILY) I wanna know

35:08.397 --> 35:10.566
where’s the crime
in impersonating a park official?

35:10.733 --> 35:13.152
-That’s not what we’re talking about.
-FREDDIE: No, it is!

35:13.611 --> 35:17.073
Oh, God. (BREATHES HEAVILY)
My stepfather molested me...

35:17.490 --> 35:20.034
-What happened this morning?
-... from when I was five till I was ten!

35:20.118 --> 35:22.245
-So, I...
-Time to tell that part later, Freddie.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.413
So I like being around children that age

35:24.497 --> 35:26.124
to enjoy their innocence,
something that was robbed from me.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.418
-But I never touched any of them!
-What happened this morning?

35:29.669 --> 35:32.004
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
I’ve made every meeting with my PO,

35:32.171 --> 35:35.716
I take all the Depo-Provera, cold sweats,
hair falling out, but I take it!

35:35.883 --> 35:38.970
-Answer me! Answer me!
-A... Alex... Alex saw

35:39.053 --> 35:41.472
the coveralls,
and he called my parole officer.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.891
All I could think about was
what would happen to me in prison again.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.561
-We’re did you get the gun?
-People won’t let me change.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.563
They won't let me move on.
This is the only thing they’ll let me...

35:48.646 --> 35:51.440
-The gun, Freddie!
-(BREATHES HEAVILY)

35:52.483 --> 35:54.402
Alex kept one in his closet...

35:54.902 --> 35:58.197
for protection. We were so angry.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.741
I barely remember pulling the trigger.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.871
Afterwards, I wanted to put one
in my head, not my arm, but...

36:05.079 --> 36:06.581
(PANTS) ...I co... I couldn’t.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.374
Have you hurt any other kids
since you’ve been out?

36:08.583 --> 36:12.461
-No, I swear to God! I swear to God! No.
-We talked to Adam and Mickey today.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.464
All these years, they've had to deal
with some people thinking they're liars!

36:15.590 --> 36:17.592
You're gonna fix that now, Freddie!

36:18.342 --> 36:19.635
(WHISPERS) I’m sorry.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.138
Tell them I’m sorry.

36:22.555 --> 36:26.767
(SOBBING, BREATHING HEAVILY)

36:38.529 --> 36:41.199
And when did you first see Captain Fraker
that day?

36:41.324 --> 36:42.491
Just before lunch.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.619
And what were the circumstances
of that meeting?

36:44.702 --> 36:46.370
He stormed out of the lieutenant’s office

36:46.454 --> 36:49.123
and told me he was gonna need
my old case files,

36:49.207 --> 36:51.167
said I should stay available
for interviews.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.460
VALERIE: Meaning what?

36:52.543 --> 36:55.546
IAB pulls your cases and says
to gear up for interviews,

36:55.630 --> 36:56.714
it means you’re under investigation.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.425
And did you see
the defendant later that afternoon?

36:59.717 --> 37:03.429
Yes. I was in the bathroom.
Captain Fraker followed me in,

37:03.596 --> 37:06.432
accused me of excessive force
in a three-year-old case

37:06.515 --> 37:07.850
said he’d have my shield.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.519
What was his demeanor like
at the time, Detective?

37:10.853 --> 37:14.690
Agitated, loud,
generally behaving like a hothead.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.652
Detective,
when did you first meet the defendant?

37:17.735 --> 37:18.778
ANDY: A couple of years ago.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.655
And what were the circumstances
of that meeting?

37:20.738 --> 37:22.782
He was investigating Lieutenant Rodriguez

37:22.865 --> 37:25.368
for supposedly failing
to report a bribe attempt.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.246
And did you speak with the defendant
about that investigation?

37:28.371 --> 37:32.792
Yes. I knew the charges had no basis.
And I was concerned that Captain Fraker

37:32.875 --> 37:35.962
was persecuting the lieutenant
for personal reasons.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.297
So we had a man-to-man talk.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.925
VALERIE:
And what was the substance of that talk?

37:41.467 --> 37:44.929
ANDY: I had received reliable information
that Captain Fraker believed

37:45.012 --> 37:47.473
that Lieutenant Rodriguez reported him
to IAB

37:47.556 --> 37:51.394
back when they were both in uniform.
I told him the lieutenant never did that,

37:51.477 --> 37:54.063
and that he was taking hostilities
too far.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.190
-What did the defendant say?
-ANDY: He played dumb.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.193
But my feeling was that Fraker
was a dirty cop on a mission,

37:59.402 --> 38:02.446
-and he couldn’t be reasoned with.
-Objection. Move to strike.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.658
Detective Sipowicz’s feelings
are irrelevant

38:05.783 --> 38:07.451
-to the case.
-EDGAR: Sustained.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.912
VALERIE: Detective,
what did you say to Captain Fraker?

38:10.079 --> 38:12.623
I said if he didn’t back off
the lieutenant, I was gonna tell his wife

38:12.707 --> 38:15.001
the truth about him sleeping
with a subordinate.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.586
And after that discussion,
how would you describe

38:17.670 --> 38:19.463
the defendant’s behavior toward the squad?

38:19.630 --> 38:22.383
Same as before.
Hostile, coming by all the time,

38:22.466 --> 38:24.427
investigating everyone for everything,

38:24.510 --> 38:26.595
like, bringing down the squad
was his full-time job.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.515
And to your knowledge,
anything come of his investigations?

38:29.682 --> 38:31.517
-Nothing.
-Thank you.

38:45.531 --> 38:46.866
Good afternoon, Detective.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.286
Is it fair to say you don’t like
Captain Fraker?

38:50.453 --> 38:53.497
-There’s a lot of bosses I don’t like.
-Is that a yes, Detective?

38:53.789 --> 38:55.166
(SIGHS) Yes.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.460
JAMES: Fair to say you don’t like IAB.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.212
I got nothing against honest cops
who do their job.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.048
But as a general matter,
you don’t look forward

39:02.131 --> 39:04.925
-to interactions with IAB.
-No cop does.

39:05.009 --> 39:09.305
In fact, you have a well-earned reputation
for being an antagonist of IAB, right?

39:09.430 --> 39:11.640
-Objection.
-EDGAR: Sustained. You’ve made your point,

39:11.724 --> 39:15.644
-Mr. Sinclair. Move on.
-You testified that earlier that day,

39:16.062 --> 39:18.647
Captain Fraker said
he was investigating you. Right?

39:18.731 --> 39:20.649
-ANDY: Yes.
-You being investigated now?

39:20.816 --> 39:22.568
-No.
-JAMES: So, Captain Fraker getting

39:22.651 --> 39:25.613
-put away suits you just fine, right?
-VALERIE: Objection.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.657
-Goes to bias.
-Sustained. Move on.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.077
Let’s talk
about your man-to-man conversation

39:31.160 --> 39:34.246
with Captain Fraker.
Just so I don’t misunderstand, Detective,

39:34.497 --> 39:37.875
are you telling us that you threatened
to expose Captain Fraker’s affair

39:38.125 --> 39:40.711
with a subordinate
if he didn’t back off his CO?

39:40.795 --> 39:43.089
-I wouldn’t call it a threat.
-What would you call it?

39:43.255 --> 39:45.091
We reached a mutual understanding

39:45.174 --> 39:48.803
that a trumped-up investigation
was in no one’s best interest.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.097
Meaning you blackmailed him
and he succumbed?

39:51.180 --> 39:52.431
You can call it what you want.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.768
I put a stop to a phony investigation
of a good cop and I'd do it again.

39:55.851 --> 39:58.771
So, you have no problem committing a crime
to get what you want.

39:58.854 --> 40:02.233
Objection. Detective Sipowicz hasn’t been
charged or convicted of anything.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.568
-EDGAR: Sustained.
-JAMES: You make a habit of blackmailing

40:04.652 --> 40:07.196
superior officers or just the ones
who are investigating your friends?

40:07.279 --> 40:08.823
-Objection.
-Sustained.

40:08.989 --> 40:12.284
-He was a bad cop doing a bad thing.
-JAMES: You blackmailed a superior officer

40:12.493 --> 40:15.329
who had you under investigation,
a man you admitted you don’t like,

40:15.454 --> 40:18.165
and we’re supposed to take your testimony
at face value?

40:18.249 --> 40:19.792
-VALERIE: Your Honor!
-He’s a bad cop.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.044
-EDGAR: Enough. Mr. Sinclair.
-He tried to murder my boss!

40:22.211 --> 40:23.754
And you’re getting
your revenge now, aren’t you?

40:23.838 --> 40:25.840
-(GAVEL POUNDING)
-This is the first day of trial,

40:26.090 --> 40:29.468
and I’m inclined to give counsel
some leeway, but let me be clear,

40:29.593 --> 40:30.886
if I sustain an objection,

40:30.970 --> 40:32.721
and you continue heading down
the same path,

40:32.805 --> 40:35.558
you do so at your peril.
Is that understood, Mr. Sinclair?

40:35.724 --> 40:39.061
Yes, Your Honor.
I have nothing further for this witness.

40:40.396 --> 40:41.647
Thank you, Detective.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.444
EDGAR: The witness is excused.

40:59.373 --> 41:02.126
(CHUCKLES ANGRILY) Oh...
If you were to ask me ten years ago

41:02.209 --> 41:05.504
if Sinclair could have sunk any lower
than the hairless rat he already was...

41:05.588 --> 41:07.131
It’s over. You’re done.

41:08.090 --> 41:09.884
I got a sitter.
Let's go get something to eat.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.178
You’re half waiting for his beady eyes
to glow red

41:12.261 --> 41:14.597
and a scaly tail to whip out
of his slacks.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.016
Oh, you would have been disappointed
if he was any different.

41:17.099 --> 41:20.102
Right now, I bet he’s in his office
on one of them... them wheels,

41:20.186 --> 41:23.522
and going round and round,
gnawing on a food pellet.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.233
Come on.
I got reservations at San Canali’s.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.361
-Don’t worry.
-(SIGHS)

41:29.528 --> 41:32.198
When it's my ass on the line, you know,
I'll take what's coming.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.408
But when they go through me
to hurt somebody else...

41:34.492 --> 41:37.661
This is the first day of the trial.
There’s still a long way to go.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.041
He got to me pretty good.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.959
Andy, this doesn’t hinge on you.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.337
I hope not, because if it does,
Rodriguez is sunk.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.464
-Let’s eat, go home.
-(SIGHS)

41:48.547 --> 41:51.133

we got no control over.

41:56.388 --> 41:59.683
If you weren’t here,
I’d be in a bar right now.

I swear to God.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.813
