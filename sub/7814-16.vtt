11:33.041 --> 11:34.333
I'll take that.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.291
Ooh, breakfast.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.959
Mmm, bacon.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.750
Nature's perfect food.

11:43.291 --> 11:46.500
Never stand between a man
and his pork products, dilweed.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.125
That's not for you, Brad.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.291
Really?
Sure tastes like it.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.583
[belches]

11:58.792 --> 12:00.000
All right, let's go.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.166
I'll deal with you later, Brad.

12:02.166 --> 12:04.667
I've got another Mother's Day
breakfast to make.

12:04.667 --> 12:05.792
Mother's Day.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.166
Hold it right there,
grease spot.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.333
I've worked long and hard
to get number one in this house,

12:11.333 --> 12:14.542
and I'm not letting you
ruin it with some cheap
Mother's Day trick.

12:14.542 --> 12:17.500
Mother's Day isn't about
you or me, Brad.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.834
It's all for Mom.

12:18.834 --> 12:21.709
Besides, Bree already has
number one locked up.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.208
Uh, good point.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.000
Also, you've ruined enough

12:26.000 --> 12:27.291
of my Mother's Day presents

12:27.291 --> 12:28.834
with that stupid notion

12:28.834 --> 12:30.000
of being number two.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.375
You are not going
to sabotage me this year.

12:50.375 --> 12:53.166
Well, I'm older than you,
bigger than you,

12:53.166 --> 12:54.542
and I want a car.

12:54.542 --> 12:58.417
No way you're gonna give Mom
a better breakfast than me.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.458
I need all the points I can--

13:00.458 --> 13:01.458
[cries out]

13:01.458 --> 13:04.291
You went there
and now it's on.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.375
[screams]

13:33.959 --> 13:36.750
Mom's favorite breakfast
is eggs and juice

13:36.750 --> 13:38.417
and that was the last of both.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.417
I can see that, dilweed.

13:40.417 --> 13:43.583
Looks like it's
a Mother's Day fail for you.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.208
Oh, it's not over yet.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.208
If Mom's favorite
is juice and eggs,

13:47.208 --> 13:50.583
I'm gonna make sure
she gets juice and eggs.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.166
[mockingly]
If Mom's favorite
is juice and eggs,

13:52.166 --> 13:53.792
and I'm gonna make sure--
[door opens]

13:53.792 --> 13:56.083
Can't let Kick beat me.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.417
Ever!

13:57.417 --> 13:58.792
[bell rings]

14:07.333 --> 14:08.792
[tires screech]

14:08.792 --> 14:11.583
Known as procrastination Sunday,

14:11.583 --> 14:15.375
this annual Mother's Day ritual
has Mellowbrooks' sons
lining up to purchase

14:15.375 --> 14:17.125
last minute
breakfast ingredients.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.500
It's calm now, but there's
a tension in the air.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.208
This could get ugly.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.458
Remain calm.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.625
There's plenty left,
but you must remain calm.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.208
We not make it time.

14:27.208 --> 14:30.583
No, you won't make it time.

14:33.375 --> 14:37.125
Perfect. Have fun not
getting any eggs and juice.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.500
If you can't an apple
from the barrel,

14:44.500 --> 14:45.667
go to the tree.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.834
And if you can't
get eggs from the store...

14:53.792 --> 14:56.166
[chickens clucking]

15:11.667 --> 15:13.542
The early bird gets the worm,

15:13.542 --> 15:17.041
but Kick Buttowski
gets the eggs.

15:19.542 --> 15:20.542
[grunts]

15:24.750 --> 15:25.667
[roars]

15:25.667 --> 15:27.709
[snorts]

15:33.709 --> 15:34.709
[roars]

15:38.542 --> 15:40.000
[pigs oink]

15:52.083 --> 15:53.583
[growls]

16:02.542 --> 16:03.917
[crowd screams]

16:03.917 --> 16:05.208
There's hardly anything left.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.291
All I could find
was anchovy paste.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.333
Is that orange juice?

16:08.333 --> 16:09.375
No.
Is that eggs?

16:09.375 --> 16:10.375
No.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.375
Then I don't want it!

16:11.375 --> 16:12.375
Guys.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.291
There's a delivery truck
pulling up.

16:14.291 --> 16:16.875
To the delivery truck.
I need eggs.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.417
[crowd chants]
Tip it!

16:21.417 --> 16:22.583
Tip it!

16:22.583 --> 16:24.583
Everyone, please, calm down.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.208
There's enough
for everyone's mother.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.166
Tip it, tip it.
I need these eggs.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.583
Eh, good enough.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.834
Give me some orange juice.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.125
It's all gone.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.333
Then think outside the carton.

16:44.375 --> 16:45.417
[roars]

16:50.375 --> 16:52.166
[roars]

16:54.917 --> 16:57.458
[snorts]

16:59.250 --> 17:00.625
[scuffling sounds]

17:03.917 --> 17:05.792
[yells]

17:05.792 --> 17:07.458
Gunther?

17:10.792 --> 17:12.667
Mother's Day breakfast.

17:15.291 --> 17:18.166
Steak, check.

17:18.166 --> 17:22.458
Know where I can find
some eggs?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.834
Thanks.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.750
Where's my orange juice?

17:26.750 --> 17:29.250
All I could find
was this orange toothpaste.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.083
Not good enough.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.667
Aah, the citrus.
It burns.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.291
And yet surprisingly refreshing.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.208
That guy's got orange juice.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.667
[crowd clamoring]

17:39.667 --> 17:42.083
Back off, it's mine.
All mine.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.542
I have a mother, too, you know?

17:47.291 --> 17:48.333
[ricochet sounds]

17:48.333 --> 17:49.792
Stand back.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.166
I have pricing gun
and I'm not afraid
to mark you down.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.333
Ow.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.959
[grunts]

17:58.667 --> 18:03.083
[cries out]

18:03.083 --> 18:04.875
[sighs]
Thank you.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.875
For a moment there
I thought I was a goner.

18:06.875 --> 18:09.250
Well, you know,
just trying to help out.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.917
Here, I'll help you carry
your juice if you'd like.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.667
Why, thank you,
my good man.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.917
Why, hello.

18:21.917 --> 18:24.667
Some one as pretty as you
buying flowers for herself?

18:24.667 --> 18:25.917
Allow me.

18:25.917 --> 18:26.917
Ooh.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.041
Yoinks.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.208
[growls]

18:29.208 --> 18:31.500
Yeah, no dilweed in sight.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.291
Brad Buttowski,
Mother's Day hero.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.166
[tires screech]

18:42.291 --> 18:43.542
Brad.
Dilweed.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.458
Smell that?
It's battery powered victory.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.458
Eggs are almost done.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.000
Enjoy yet another
Mother's Day fail, dilweed.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.333
[laughs]

19:21.583 --> 19:23.667
[Wade]
You sure this will work,
danger dude?

19:23.667 --> 19:25.834
Punch it.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.917
[engine revs]

19:27.917 --> 19:30.792
Mind if I have
one of your flowers?

19:30.792 --> 19:32.291
Sure, forget about
Mother's Day?

19:32.291 --> 19:33.667
What's Mother's Day?

19:33.667 --> 19:35.500
[bell rings]

19:37.583 --> 19:39.542
You're going down, dilweed.

19:39.542 --> 19:41.125
In flames.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.834
The only thing
I'm going down in is history.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.083
[mockingly]
Only thing I'm going
down in is pain.

19:51.417 --> 19:54.333
Ha, taste the sweet smell
of losingness, loser.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.625
I'm gonna get to Mom first.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.208
Well, now, two hot breakfasts.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.583
Why did you both make
Mom breakfast?

20:01.583 --> 20:03.291
To celebrate Mother's Day.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.291
To beat Kick out
from number two in the house.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.709
Now, that is silly.

20:06.709 --> 20:10.709
You are both number two
after me, of course.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.542
[both laugh]

20:14.166 --> 20:15.333
Okay, what's-- what's so funny?

20:15.333 --> 20:16.834
You think you're number one?

20:16.834 --> 20:20.125
Dad, we all know Bree
is number one around here.

20:20.125 --> 20:23.250
Oh, son, I don't want
to hurt anyone's feelings.

20:23.250 --> 20:27.834
But we all know I'm number one.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.959
[both laugh]

20:30.959 --> 20:32.250
Okay, Dad.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.166
And these Mother's Day coupons

20:34.166 --> 20:36.333
ought to lock that place down
for another year.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.208
One free trash emptying.

20:38.208 --> 20:40.417
One 15-second foot rub.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.792
First dibs on the, uh,
newspaper.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.959
Hey, look over there.

20:47.959 --> 20:49.458
Hey, that's for Mom.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.083
[scuffling sounds]

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
Happy--

20:56.500 --> 20:57.542
Mother's--
Day.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.500
She's not even here.
What?

21:02.500 --> 21:04.875
Where do you think she is?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.458
How are your eggs, Mom?

21:08.458 --> 21:10.667
Oh, they're absolutely perfect.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.083
And your juice?

21:12.083 --> 21:13.583
Wonderful.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.208
Thank you for such a wonderful

21:15.208 --> 21:17.208
Mother's Day breakfast,
Brianna.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.250
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

21:20.959 --> 21:23.834
It's still the best
Mother's Day ever,

21:23.834 --> 21:25.667
Nothing could ruin
this beautiful day.

21:25.667 --> 21:26.709
[gasps]

21:29.041 --> 21:31.291
[Mom]
Boys!
