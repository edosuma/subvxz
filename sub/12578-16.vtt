WEBVTT

00:05.296 --> 00:06.965
Boy, look at Pops go.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.676
80 years old and he still has
the reaction time

00:09.676 --> 00:12.887
- to miss the sprinkler heads.
- Tony Curtis is 80.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.395
Huh. Look at him.
Now he's just showboating.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.773
Come on, Pops. Let's see those hands
at 10:00 and 2:00.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.570
- Uh, Pops?
- Mr. Popisito?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.868
Oh, man, it don't... Hey! Hey, man!

01:08.610 --> 01:10.528
Boy, I'll tell you, it's sad,

01:10.612 --> 01:12.697
but at least he went doing what he loved.

01:12.781 --> 01:16.493
Well, we should all be so lucky.
You know how I want to go?

01:16.493 --> 01:20.830
Right here in the alley with you guys.
Yeah, it'll probably be my heart

01:20.914 --> 01:22.290
the way things are going.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.003
Ooh, hey, we should rent
that house ourselves.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.255
We can turn it into a clubhouse.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.718
I am currently an official supporter
of the clubhouse idea.

01:33.802 --> 01:37.013
I also reserve the right
to be called "Dash."

01:37.097 --> 01:39.265
- And I'll be "Spike."
- A clubhouse?

01:40.225 --> 01:43.144
I don't know. Isn't that something you do
when you're in your 30s?

01:43.228 --> 01:44.229
Naw, man. Come on, Hank.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.815
You know we get
a little ol' DVD player, man.

01:46.815 --> 01:50.318
Coming in on show,
just grabbing in the dang freeze-frame,

01:50.318 --> 01:52.654
talking about a fridge full of beer, too,
man, you know.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.033
Well, Boomhauer,
I'll tell you you ought to be in sales.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.578
- All right, I'm in.
- Welcome to the clubhouse, Hank.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.164
- What do you want to be called?
- How 'bout Rudy?

02:03.248 --> 02:06.835
- How 'bout Hank?
- Hank it is... Rudy.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.425
You are so late.

02:14.509 --> 02:18.429
You know I like my bath at 9:30,
with my onion loaf.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.432
I'm sorry.
The cash register didn't balance,

02:21.516 --> 02:24.519
and it took Gary 20 minutes to confess.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.231
Do you mind if I just take
a quick shower first?

02:28.231 --> 02:30.525
- I smell like waitressing.
- I'm sorry.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.777
My bath is already drawn.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.367
Okay, I'm taking off my boxers.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.164
- What the...

02:44.747 --> 02:46.875
- Oh! Luanne!
- Oh, my God.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.585
I thought you guys were sleeping.

02:51.171 --> 02:55.049
- But you guys weren't sleeping.
- Exit the master bedroom right now!

02:59.345 --> 03:00.388
Boxers.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.100
Luanne, we have rules in this house.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.896
Why are you guys getting so upset?
I didn't see anything.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.522
You saw your Uncle's nipples.

03:11.482 --> 03:17.739
The way I see it you are
in direct violation of four of our rules.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.699
You had it notarized?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.535
No water usage after 10:00 p.m.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.038
9:00 p.m. curfew on school nights.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.625
Entering the master bedroom
without verbal permission,

03:28.625 --> 03:32.503
and you're barefoot in the kitchen.
Lady Bird eats off that floor.

03:32.587 --> 03:38.468
God only has ten rules, Uncle Hank,
and his house is much bigger.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.765
All right, Dale, for the last time
I can't turn in this rental application

03:43.765 --> 03:47.602
- without your social security number.
- Fine.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.439
Five, five, five... Five, five.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.985
That's not even enough numbers.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.238
Five. Five.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.490
Okay, I'm leaving your name off,

04:00.490 --> 04:03.952
but you're still responsible
for one-fourth of the rent.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.538
I figure I can pull my extra workbench
out of public storage

04:07.622 --> 04:10.625
and keep it in the clubhouse.
That'll save me a few bucks a month.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.085
And I've given it some thought,

04:12.085 --> 04:15.129
and I have decided
to start charging Luanne some rent

04:15.213 --> 04:16.714
for living in my den.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.384
See, a house right across from me.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.346
They want to use our clubhouse
as their living quarters.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.182
Hank, we have to do something.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.102
I don't know, Kahn. The house looks nice,

04:29.102 --> 04:31.354
but the neighborhood looks
a little hillbilly to me.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.899
Hillbilly? Hey, I have an idea.
Follow my lead.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.321
Hey, Mr. Kahn. Them some fancy blue jeans

04:40.405 --> 04:42.949
y'alls lady friend is wearing.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.867
They must be city folks.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.620
I just whipped up
a new batch of possum stew

04:47.704 --> 04:52.125
I'd be willing to share with you.
Don't worry. I took off the feet.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.293
What did he just say?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.503
All great chefs doing that now.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.922
Wolfgang Puck cut the feet off
of everything.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.299
<i>♪ Got my own fine life ♪</i>

04:59.299 --> 05:00.550
-<i>♪ Got my own fiddle ♪</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:01.551
<i>♪ Sun's coming up ♪</i>

05:01.551 --> 05:03.136
<i>♪ I got Gribble, Gribble, Gribble ♪</i>

05:03.136 --> 05:06.931
<i>♪ Life ain't nothing
but a funny, funny riddle ♪</i>

05:07.015 --> 05:09.350
<i>♪ Thank God, I'm a country boy ♪</i>

05:09.434 --> 05:12.353
They're just day laborers.
They're putting in my deck.

05:14.439 --> 05:18.067
Our plan worked. Spike, Rudy, Boomhauer,

05:18.151 --> 05:21.946
- let's check out our new clubhouse.
- Yo, man, you talking 'bout...

05:22.030 --> 05:23.865
Everybody got a dang
ole nickname 'cept me, man.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.950
I don't like it...
Dang ol' odd man out, man.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.120
All right, Boomhauer.
What do you want to be called?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.164
Oh, B-Dog.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
- So I figure

05:32.749 --> 05:37.837
if we knock down that wall and build
a new wall over there, that'd be fun.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.673
Hey, a refrigerator.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.636
- Look, Pops' last beer.
- Huh.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.434
Huh. To Pops.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.813
That son of a bitch had a swimming pool?

05:55.897 --> 05:57.815
I thought I heard splashing.

05:57.899 --> 06:02.070
How could you not know?
You lived next door to him for 18 years.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.572
- I thought he lived on a lake.
- What lake?

06:04.572 --> 06:06.032
It was none of my business.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.659
So, you're the ones who broke my lock box.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.412
Uh, was the open house canceled?

06:11.496 --> 06:15.416
I'm sorry. This house has already
been rented to a lovely college student.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.001
College student?

06:17.085 --> 06:20.129
No college student's going to have
a credit history like mine.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.718
Here are your keys, Ms. Platter.
Welcome home.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.678
Luanne?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.641
Young lady, you'd better march
right back into Hank's den.

06:31.641 --> 06:35.144
That's your home and that will always be
your home, right, Hank?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.314
Luanne, welcome to your new home.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.572
<i>I'm not going to be stingy
with the packing tape, Luanne,</i>

06:46.656 --> 06:47.907
you tape away.

06:47.907 --> 06:52.078
It's not that I want to move
it's just that I hate living here.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.666
- There's just too many rules.
- Yep. Way too many rules.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.085
- Good-bye.
- And if I have to pay rent,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.753
I'm not going to sleep in a den

07:00.837 --> 07:03.840
and share a bathtub
with a 12-year-old boy. Okay?

07:03.840 --> 07:07.927
Rent? Excuse me.
Hank, did you pass a new law

07:07.927 --> 07:09.887
while this Hill was not in session?

07:09.971 --> 07:14.016
Just tied up a rental loophole.
The important thing is she's happy.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.561
And I'm not paying for it all alone.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.148
See, this friend of mine
who got kicked out of her apartment,

07:20.148 --> 07:23.651
she had three roommates who also
got kicked out of the apartment,

07:23.651 --> 07:26.654
and she said I could have them.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.281
I don't know.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.785
I just think that I should move out
before we end up hating each other.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.622
- Oh, Luanne, we could never hate...
- She's making a good point, Peggy.

07:41.002 --> 07:46.132
We lost everything so fast.
And Hank did nothing to stop it

07:46.132 --> 07:49.427
- like the Swiss.
- How's your precious den?

07:49.427 --> 07:53.681
Visual confirmation.
Roommate number one, female.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.475
She's dating a jarhead, huh?

07:56.142 --> 08:00.146
Well, my first choice was the Marines
but I couldn't do enough sit-ups

08:00.146 --> 08:03.399
to be a Marine Corps barber. Semper fi.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.737
Oh, great, we got a disco dancer.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.906
Anyone can move slow.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.699
Shh...

08:13.868 --> 08:15.495
Sh-sh-shaw...

08:17.747 --> 08:19.207
Hey.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.460
Hey, guys drinking beer,
you're in my parking spot.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.214
No, I don't think so.
This is where we assemble.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.465
Always has been.

08:27.465 --> 08:32.178
Well, always has been
Texas Penal code 4-9.02,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.138
which prohibits public drunkenness.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.266
What are you talking about?
Nobody's drunk here.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.644
I don't know, Hank, I'm pretty buzzed.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.522
- My lease says this is my space.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.065
- Hey!

08:46.817 --> 08:48.110
Thought so.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.824
Gentlemen,
I give you roommate number three.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.159
I kind of like her.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.885
Huh?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.267
Little help?

09:19.267 --> 09:20.810
- Thank you.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.442
Now, you've got a lawsuit.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
The audacity.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.741
I have unplugged your house from my house.

09:35.825 --> 09:40.037
Mm, that's not very neighborly of you.
You know, when it hits 105 degrees,

09:40.121 --> 09:43.374
and you want to use my pool
and drink my soy shakes,

09:43.374 --> 09:44.584
I'm going to remember this.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.920
Yeah? Well, there goes
your welcome-wagon tool set.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.255
You happy?

09:52.550 --> 09:53.634
<i>So...</i>

09:53.718 --> 09:56.387
Who'd like to meet my other roommates?

09:56.387 --> 09:59.056
The Manger Babies.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.226
This is Sir Reginald
Featherbottom the Third.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.477
And...

10:03.561 --> 10:04.729
Oh...

10:04.729 --> 10:06.355
I know what you're thinking.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.816
I perform a Christian puppet show and...

10:08.816 --> 10:12.236
Okay. We need to go to the grocery store.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.988
I already went to the store.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.950
And Sir Reginald noticed
how expensive food is these days.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.410
There's food?

10:21.037 --> 10:24.206
They're not going to leave you
a speck, what, what.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.879
One in the garage, one in the den.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.299
Whatcha doin'?

10:33.299 --> 10:37.553
Oh, Nothing.
Just, uh, working on my den.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.104
I always wanted a clubhouse
with a secret knock.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.190
How about, uh...

10:51.651 --> 10:53.986
No, that's the secret knock
at the gun club.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.490
I don't want to get confused.
How about this?

11:01.535 --> 11:04.872
Uh, you know, part of the reason
I agreed to the clubhouse idea

11:04.872 --> 11:09.251
was that one of the bedrooms over there
was going to be my private den

11:09.335 --> 11:11.629
and, well, now that I've got my den...

11:12.755 --> 11:16.300
- Our clubhouse.
- My den.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.722
Yep. That's the official knock.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.767
It'll hold us until I get
a retina scanner.

11:30.773 --> 11:37.238
Hey, guys, I figured out all the bills.
I used additions and subtractions.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.990
Ooh, wow, I'm going to have
to catch up with you later.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.659
See, I have a bike race coming up

11:41.659 --> 11:43.744
and there's going to be
this chick there that I dig,

11:43.828 --> 11:46.080
so I need a new shirt
that really sports my abs.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.749
- I mean, check it out.
- Yeah, I can't pay this right now, either.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.584
I'm going to Vegas this weekend.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.920
- Um... Okay.

11:53.546 --> 11:57.842
Kate? The phone bill is pretty much
100 percent yours.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.013
So, anyway, my little sister,
she borrowed my Kangol hat.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.223
Yes, I'm mad.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.812
Listen. When I signed up
for phone service,

12:09.812 --> 12:12.398
I signed a document
that said I would pay on time.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.235
I swore it... on my mother's maiden name!

12:16.235 --> 12:19.405
You're kind of being a house nazi
right now, Luanne.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.410
Hello. I thought we agreed
no smoking in the house.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.080
You know who else had anti-smoking laws?
Uh, who was it?

12:28.748 --> 12:29.915
Oh, yeah. Hitler.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.667
Nazi.

12:48.225 --> 12:54.732
Luanne! What's up, girlfriend?
I have not seen you in the longest.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.778
Oh, okay.
You guys are finished with dinner already.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.363
Why? Are you hungry?
Luanne, are you eating?

13:01.447 --> 13:05.075
- Do you need money? Get my purse.
- No, no, no, Aunt Peggy, no.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.788
I'm on my own now
and I don't need help from anyone.

13:09.580 --> 13:14.126
Oh, but I am doing a book report
on what people eat for dinner.

13:14.835 --> 13:19.548
- So... What did you eat?
- Let me fix you a to-go plate.

13:24.845 --> 13:28.140
- Hey, Luanne, what you got there?
- Nothing. This isn't mine.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.852
It's nice to see Luanne once in a while.
Knowing she'll be leaving

13:31.936 --> 13:34.355
kind of makes it like a fun game.

13:34.355 --> 13:37.274
There is nothing funny about starvation.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.235
Except for comic relief, of course.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.279
- Now, Luanne is very proud

13:42.363 --> 13:43.906
and may not accept our charity,

13:43.906 --> 13:46.659
but she is also very hungry,
so, who knows?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.662
Luanne is usually home from work by now.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.334
Whoa! Whoa!

13:59.713 --> 14:04.218
Guys can shave their legs, too?
That's very interesting.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.261
- Peggy!
- Bobby!

14:05.261 --> 14:06.220
Sorry, Dad.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.556
Heads up. Der Fuehrer's home from work.

14:12.101 --> 14:17.314
Whose turn is it to take the trash out?
Don't make me get out the chore wheel.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.527
Oh... Uncle Hank, Aunt Peggy, you're here.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.154
- We brought a casserole for dinner.
- No. No. No.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.490
I won't hear of it! I'm on my own now,

14:26.574 --> 14:29.535
and I can make you dinner.
Dinner. I'm on it.

14:30.244 --> 14:34.623
Oh, God, crap. Dinner. Uh...

14:34.707 --> 14:36.417
Where are crackers?

14:37.001 --> 14:40.546
Where is my macaroni and the cheese?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.465
Where are my steak-ums?

14:43.966 --> 14:45.759
That is it!

14:46.468 --> 14:49.972
Who ate all my food? Come forward!

14:49.972 --> 14:51.765
I needed a carbo-load.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.852
Griffin! Ew!

14:54.852 --> 14:59.148
We said no shaving in the living room
unless it was an emergency.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.442
- Yuck...
- Sieg heil.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.737
When I think of how many stupid
onion loafs

15:04.737 --> 15:07.823
I had to sell so you people
could talk on the phone

15:07.907 --> 15:11.160
and eat my cookies, it makes me so...

15:15.164 --> 15:18.208
Hank, maybe we should intervene.

15:18.292 --> 15:22.671
- You go talk to the German one.
- We have rules in this house!

15:22.755 --> 15:26.634
We all agreed to them, people!
I'm counting at least...

15:26.634 --> 15:30.095
...twelve! Twelve violations!

15:31.138 --> 15:35.768
Oh... My... God...

15:35.768 --> 15:40.314
I have become you. Oh...

15:42.191 --> 15:44.860
I hate myself.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.619
I'm worried about Luanne.
She hates herself

15:53.619 --> 15:57.289
because she's become Bobby?
I mean, what's that all about?

15:57.373 --> 16:00.167
Hank, she was pointing at you.
She's become you

16:00.167 --> 16:04.088
- and that is why she hates herself.
- Oh, well, then she's just crazy.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.633
Hank, please talk to her.
I... I can hear her crying in her room.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.552
- Her room? My den.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.554
And for all we know,
she could be laughing.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.557
All right.

16:21.230 --> 16:25.651
It is very sad to see people
take advantage of the kindness of others.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.361
Yes, it Is.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.073
All right, Bill, Dale, Boomhauer, get out.
Come on.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.160
Spike, Dash, B-Dog.

16:39.248 --> 16:43.711
You know, back in your house
when you said, "I've become you."

16:43.711 --> 16:44.920
Yeah?

16:45.004 --> 16:48.382
Well, you said it like, "I've become you."

16:48.382 --> 16:51.844
When, well, you probably
could have said it more like,

16:51.844 --> 16:54.430
-"Hey, I've become you!"
- What?

16:54.430 --> 16:57.808
You see, Luanne,
a lot of good stuff happened in the world

16:57.808 --> 16:59.768
when people were like me.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.438
Sure, they'll never write
a Hollywood musical

17:02.438 --> 17:05.315
about a fellow who keeps
his yard free of debris

17:05.399 --> 17:10.029
and pays his bills on time,
and the MTV won't put on a video

17:10.029 --> 17:13.073
about a man who requires shoes
in the kitchen,

17:13.157 --> 17:15.284
but it's because of people like us...

17:15.284 --> 17:19.288
But I'm not like you!
This is just too much for me!

17:19.288 --> 17:22.541
And... Oh... And all the bills,

17:22.541 --> 17:25.878
and they mooch my food
and they're always on the phone!

17:25.878 --> 17:30.007
And I just can't take it anymore!
I can't stand one more day!

17:30.007 --> 17:32.843
They're wearing my socks, Uncle Hank!

17:35.179 --> 17:38.223
Oh, God! Oh, God, I need a paper bag!

17:38.307 --> 17:41.185
Now, take it easy.
You didn't see me getting all huffy

17:41.185 --> 17:45.105
- every time you made me mad.
- I made you mad?

17:45.189 --> 17:49.068
Sure. And you were three times
the pain in the butt these kids are.

17:49.068 --> 17:53.280
Oh, good. Then you'll be able
to handle them for me.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.865
Maybe I could,

17:54.865 --> 17:57.576
but I don't want to give you a fish, Luanne.

17:57.576 --> 18:01.747
I want to teach you how to fish.
That way, you'll eat forever.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.584
Hello, I'm with the electric company.
Don't mind me.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.127
I'll only be a minute.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.423
I'm on break.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.426
Please, continue
with your private conversation.

18:14.510 --> 18:19.431
Do not worry. I am deaf
and cannot hear what you are saying.

18:20.599 --> 18:24.353
You know, Luanne, you and I both wanted
a little place of our own.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.022
I thought my den would be my oasis

18:27.106 --> 18:28.982
but now the only place I can get away

18:29.066 --> 18:31.819
from the various annoyances
in my life is...

18:31.819 --> 18:34.196
"Is"?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.241
...is my lawn.

18:37.241 --> 18:42.079
When I'm out there mowing, edging,
watering, even fertilizing

18:42.079 --> 18:46.083
nothing else matters.
Yep, that's what you got to do, Luanne.

18:46.083 --> 18:50.420
Find yourself a project.
Find your own lawn.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.550
That's it?

18:54.550 --> 18:57.678
I couldn't help but overhear
your uncle's bad advice.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.304
- What?
- Aha!

18:59.388 --> 19:03.142
It is I, Dale Gribble,
master of a thousand faces.

19:03.142 --> 19:07.646
You just met face number two,
the deaf electrician.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.566
The only thing your roommates...
i.e., enemies...

19:10.566 --> 19:14.695
will understand is fear...
i.e., psychological warfare...

19:14.695 --> 19:17.281
i.e., dirty tricks.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.366
- It worked for Dick Nixon.
- Well, but...

19:19.366 --> 19:22.161
For example,
get ahold of some goat's blood,

19:22.161 --> 19:25.581
taint that blood.
Then, when your roommates need blood

19:25.581 --> 19:29.626
give them the tainted goat's blood.
It's a perfect plan.

19:29.710 --> 19:34.423
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I just want them to do the dishes.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.759
Oh. Well, in that case,
stack the dishes in the shower.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.262
That's the way Nancy gets me to do them.

19:44.183 --> 19:48.061
- Luanne, do you mind?
- Ick! What are you doing?

19:48.145 --> 19:50.230
Well, somebody left
a bunch of dishes in the shower.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.398
That's kind of rude.

19:55.152 --> 20:00.532
Good lord! I hate these people!
I know, Jesus, I know.

20:00.616 --> 20:05.954
You told me never to say hate.
But I'm sorry, Lord. I really, really do.

20:18.842 --> 20:21.386
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.066
Hey, Uncle Hank. Guess what?

20:34.066 --> 20:38.362
Right this second,
the P.H. balance in this pool

20:38.362 --> 20:41.031
is absolutely perfect.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.575
So, you found yourself a project.

20:43.659 --> 20:47.871
Do you get the same, uh,
high I get from lawn care?

20:47.955 --> 20:51.291
You know, I think I do.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.126
- Excuse me.

20:53.210 --> 20:57.714
You didn't pay your bills, did you?
Oh, well, Luanne, at least you tried.

20:57.798 --> 21:03.011
Oh, I paid my bills.
And then I closed all the accounts.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.975
If my roommates want gas,
water, electricity or a phone,

21:07.975 --> 21:11.395
they can just open up their own accounts.
Simple as that.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.275
You know, if you're ever up late
studying for a test

21:16.275 --> 21:20.070
and you want a little electricity
I've still got that extension cord.

21:20.070 --> 21:24.825
No, thanks, Uncle Hank.
You taught me how to fish.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.675
- Yep.
- Yep.

21:59.276 --> 22:03.113
This place looks terrible!

22:03.113 --> 22:04.114
You ain't Pops.

22:04.114 --> 22:07.451
Oh, that old guy, yeah. He died.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.368
Dead?

22:08.869 --> 22:11.371
Then I'm arresting you
for suspicion of murder.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.664
Grab him, Topsy.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.499
All right, boy, just come a little closer.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.752
Hey, get your hands off me, you nazi!

22:16.752 --> 22:19.588
Who are you calling a nazi?!

22:19.588 --> 22:20.630
No!

22:25.218 --> 22:27.971
All right, Topsy, let's roll.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.723
- <i>Truth or dare?</i>
- <i>Dare.</i>
