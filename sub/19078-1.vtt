00:09.577 --> 00:12.013
- [Chris] Have you ever seen Brown Bunny?
- [Chester] No.

00:12.080 --> 00:12.981
What's that?

00:13.047 --> 00:15.483
[Chris] It's a movie with Chloë Sevigny
and Vincent Gallo.

00:15.550 --> 00:19.187
And in it, Chloë Sevigny goes down
on Vincent Gallo for like five minutes.

00:19.254 --> 00:21.814
- And they use his real penis.
[Chester] That's just pornography.

00:22.457 --> 00:25.693
No, it's not. It's called acting.
If you wrote in a script

00:25.960 --> 00:28.363
that I suck your dick for five minutes,
I would do it.

00:28.663 --> 00:30.165
Why? Because you're paying me.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.368
I wouldn't suck your dick for six minutes,
I wouldn't do it for four.

00:33.435 --> 00:35.036
I would fucking full method it,

00:35.103 --> 00:38.440
and just Daniel Day-Lewis your penis
in my mouth for five minutes.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.308
Does that make me gay? No.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.310
Just makes me, like, a really good actor.

00:42.377 --> 00:45.713
Okay, in this situation, why am I
the one paying you to suck my dick?

00:45.980 --> 00:49.017
- Would you rather suck my dick?
- I don't wanna suck anyone's dick.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.186
You shouldn't have written it
in the script.

00:51.386 --> 00:52.554
[cell phone ringing]

00:52.720 --> 00:56.458
Danny, I know what you'll say. It's okay.
I'll get you your money. Don't worry.

00:57.692 --> 00:59.260
What? Why 800?

00:59.327 --> 01:01.029
[cell phone ringing and buzzing]

01:01.963 --> 01:04.098
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

01:04.299 --> 01:06.734
Fuck it, call the cops.
I don't give a shit anymore.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.037
It's all you. Goodbye.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.573
- What happened?
- I am so screwed.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.308
"I'm so screwed. Feel bad for me."

01:13.374 --> 01:15.243
You're such a drama queen sometimes.

01:15.710 --> 01:16.711
Oh, shit!

01:17.312 --> 01:19.447
- Brake, brake, brake!
- Brake! [Screaming]

01:23.051 --> 01:26.554
[Chester] Uh-huh. It's about 70,000 miles,
but it's... It's in great shape.

01:27.622 --> 01:31.125
Mm-hm. Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
The trunk has an automatic latch,

01:31.192 --> 01:32.327
in the front.

01:32.594 --> 01:34.696
Yeah, and the trunk is super spacious.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.765
It's really big, like a living room.
Could fit a love seat.

01:40.001 --> 01:41.001
No.

01:41.069 --> 01:42.470
No, no, not really, no.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.073
I'll see you there, Carlo. Thank you.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.307
Okay.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.576
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, bye.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.411
Yes.

[woman over recording]
Welcome to The Travel Linguist.

02:03.658 --> 02:05.293
This is Portuguese 101.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.795
In this lesson,
you will learn common greetings.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.268
The word for "hello" is oi.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.677
The word for "please" is por favor.

02:22.744 --> 02:23.744
[car horn honks]

02:24.579 --> 02:27.682
[car horn honking]

02:27.749 --> 02:29.551
[woman over recording
speaking in Portuguese]

02:29.617 --> 02:31.219
[speaks in Portuguese]

02:31.486 --> 02:33.721
[in English] That's right.
Don't forget to roll the R's.

02:33.788 --> 02:35.590
[continues speaking in Portuguese]

02:37.825 --> 02:40.295
- The word for "thank you" is obrigado.
- Let's go!

02:40.762 --> 02:42.230
Start the car! Let's go!

02:42.297 --> 02:43.498
[engine starts]

02:44.132 --> 02:46.668
Cool. Hey, don't slam the door.
Don't slam the...

02:46.734 --> 02:48.469
[Chris]
What the fuck are you listening to?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.856
- [Chester] I'm learning Portuguese.
- I gotta change this.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.143
- What's wrong with this?
- No.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.477
Why isn't this working?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.146
Can we not with the merchandise?

02:58.212 --> 03:01.349
This is a vintage automobile.
It needs to be treated with kid gloves.

03:01.416 --> 03:03.418
All right? And when did you start smoking?

03:03.484 --> 03:07.088
What? I needed to change things up, okay?
It was either this or Scientology.

03:07.155 --> 03:10.258
And I can't wear maritime-style uniforms.
It makes my face look fat.

03:11.159 --> 03:14.595
Well, I just sold this car,
so, let's take care of it, and no smoking.

03:14.662 --> 03:18.166
Can you cover my register for 30 minutes?
I need to meet this guy at 10:30.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.232
What guy?

03:19.567 --> 03:22.403
Carlo. The guy from Craigslist.
He called me this morning.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.872
He wants to buy the car.
This guy has an amazing story.

03:25.139 --> 03:26.507
He just moved to this country...

03:26.574 --> 03:30.178
- You sold your car without consulting me?
- Are you even listening to me?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.580
- That's pretty selfish.
- Can you cover my register?

03:32.647 --> 03:35.249
If you sell your car,
how do we get to Rock the Bells?

03:35.316 --> 03:38.186
I can't go to a concert.
I just told you I'm gonna meet Carlo.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.754
Then I'll work a double. Go home.

03:39.821 --> 03:43.891
- Pack. That's my night. I'm booked up.
- You know what I did to get these tickets?

03:44.158 --> 03:46.761
I'm not going to a concert
with your brother's fake tickets.

03:46.828 --> 03:49.263
Sell 'em
and get your car out of the impound, man.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.732
- Grow up. Get a life.
- Okay.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.767
And what are you packing for, huh?

03:52.834 --> 03:55.770
Brazil. I'm going to Brazil.
You remember Brazil, right?

03:55.837 --> 03:58.706
Doing that this early in the morning?
The Brazil conversation?

03:58.773 --> 04:00.808
- Not...
- All right. All right. I'll do it.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.543
Well, did you get your ticket yet?

04:02.610 --> 04:04.612
I mean, not yet, but I will.

04:04.679 --> 04:07.181
No. I didn't think so.
We're going to the concert.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.217
No, no, no.
We're not going to the concert.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.553
Because as soon as I sell this car
I'm using that money to buy a ticket.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.590
I'm serious this time.
You're not gonna talk me out of it, okay?

04:16.190 --> 04:18.358
You're...?
You're still coming with me, right?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.696
Yeah, I'm coming with you, okay?
For the millionth time.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.630
Good.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.732
So,
then stop being such a downer about it.

04:24.799 --> 04:26.267
- All right?
- I'm not a downer.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.671
It's just that you've talked about Brazil
every week for the last 4 years,

04:29.737 --> 04:33.207
so, it's like the boy who cried wolf,
then got gang-banged by the wolf

04:33.274 --> 04:36.310
- and all his friends.
- I don't wanna hear another word from you.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.619
Real quick, can we go over this
whole moving-to-another-continent idea?

04:44.686 --> 04:48.423
I mean, I'm down, I just wanna make sure
that we're not gonna regret it forever.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.457
That's a good idea.

04:49.524 --> 04:50.725
Yeah, okay.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.796
This is how I plan
to retire when we move to Brazil.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.332
- Shit, you trying to smoke that?
- What? No.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.901
- You wanna snort it?
- How would...?

04:59.967 --> 05:03.504
- You're fucking crazy. I'm in, though.
- No, no, no. This is guayusa.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.307
- I don't get it.
- It's an Amazonian super leaf,

05:06.374 --> 05:08.576
packed with caffeine
and natural antioxidants.

05:08.643 --> 05:10.778
I've been researching this stuff
for months.

05:10.845 --> 05:12.447
You wanna know how much it costs

05:12.513 --> 05:15.283
- to ship and produce this one bottle?
- Four seventy-nine?

05:15.583 --> 05:16.583
Seventy-five cents.

05:17.218 --> 05:19.353
And they sell it here for $4.79,
for people...

05:19.420 --> 05:20.521
For people like that.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.858
That's a $3 profit margin
that these companies are making.

05:23.925 --> 05:26.461
That's what you're doing
in your spare time, Chester?

05:26.527 --> 05:27.729
Researching bottled drinks?

05:27.795 --> 05:29.864
- That's weird.
- Oh, shut up. That's not weird.

05:29.931 --> 05:30.932
Guayusa's the future.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.501
- Will you stop pronouncing it like that?
- Like what?

05:33.568 --> 05:35.269
- Guayusa.
- Guayusa.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.971
- Guayusa.
- Guayusa.

05:37.238 --> 05:38.673
- Guayusa.
- I'm saying guayusa.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.708
Okay. So, when we get to Brazil,

05:40.775 --> 05:43.644
your plan is to start some natural
energy drink using guayusa,

05:43.711 --> 05:45.913
and then sell it
to high-end markets in the U.S.?

05:45.980 --> 05:47.014
I mean, genius, right?

05:47.281 --> 05:51.752
I don't know how to explain this,
but your plan is fucking dumb as shit.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.387
Does that make sense?

05:53.454 --> 05:54.689
Is that registering or...?

05:54.755 --> 05:57.325
Forget it. You're out.
Have fun making minimum wage.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.861
Let me explain why it won't work.
When we get to Brazil,

05:59.927 --> 06:02.597
we don't have any job prospects,
so we can't make money.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.333
We don't know anyone,
so we won't have a social life.

06:05.399 --> 06:09.270
We have to wear a condom when we have sex.
That means no pulling out on girls.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.372
Excuse me.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.307
- I'm so sorry. Please.
- No problem.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.343
Is the morning-after pill
legal down there?

06:15.409 --> 06:17.645
All right,
let's take it down a couple of notches.

06:17.712 --> 06:20.014
- There's a...
- It's a Catholic country. Picture this.

06:20.281 --> 06:22.750
I'm dicking some beautiful Brazilian,
getting confident,

06:22.817 --> 06:24.852
I start long-stroking her, boom,
the condom breaks.

06:24.919 --> 06:27.655
- There's a baby.
- Can I just go to the pharmacy and get it

06:27.722 --> 06:30.324
or do I have to drop her off
at some unlicensed doctor

06:30.391 --> 06:33.294
- to handle it holistically?
- I gotta go. I don't know you. Bye.

06:33.361 --> 06:34.361
- I know you.
- No.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.831
I ask the tough questions,
Chester, and so should you.

06:36.898 --> 06:37.999
I don't know you.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.035
You have a very bright future
ahead of you, Chris.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.337
Thank you. I know I do.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.045
Ah. Chris. Dude.

06:51.312 --> 06:53.347
I heard, man.
Let me tell you something.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.816
This shoulder has your name
written all over it.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.386
If you need a good cry, man,
let the tears flow...

06:58.452 --> 06:59.654
What are you talking about?

07:00.588 --> 07:03.691
Word got out. Everyone's talking about
how Brooke broke up with you.

07:03.758 --> 07:04.959
Let me tell you something.

07:05.026 --> 07:07.061
I have no problem taking
your sloppy seconds.

07:07.328 --> 07:09.564
As a matter of fact,
I prefer your sloppy seconds.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.699
It's like your stamp of approval
on the pussy.

07:11.766 --> 07:14.535
This is how you come at me
this early in the morning, Greg?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.671
Why don't you ask about
my grandma's dementia?

07:17.338 --> 07:18.706
[speaking in Portuguese]

07:21.609 --> 07:23.249
[Chris]
Fucking Greg and his ginger shots.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.613
[speaks in Portuguese]

07:29.517 --> 07:32.053
I'm going with or without you.
I freaking hate this place.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.855
Rich people judging me all the time.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.756
Greg and his stupid Cool Runnings hat.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.992
There won't be concerts like this
in Brazil.

07:38.059 --> 07:41.028
- There'll be concerts like this in Brazil.
- Rock the Bells?

07:41.095 --> 07:44.866
No, but clearly you haven't
heard the funky sounds

07:44.932 --> 07:45.800
of Jorge Ben Jor.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.468
- [music playing over cell phone]
- Huh?

07:47.935 --> 07:51.639
I don't mean for this to sound racist,
but that music is killing me.

07:51.706 --> 07:55.910
Why? It's great. This is fantastic music.
Have you seen Brazilian women dance?

07:55.977 --> 07:58.579
Yeah. "Brazilian"
is my favorite porn search word

07:58.646 --> 08:00.014
before "drunk" and "amateur."

08:00.081 --> 08:03.517
I don't know what it is about amateur.
I like it. It's more authentic.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.920
- Sell me something with integrity.
- Hundred percent.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.722
We'll have all the time in the world

08:07.788 --> 08:10.424
to talk about porn preference
and samba to salsa music.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.894
It's in the IE, man.
That's like three hours away.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.528
Please. I need this.

08:15.429 --> 08:16.864
I will pack after the concert,

08:16.931 --> 08:19.400
and we will take the first flight
in the morning.

08:19.467 --> 08:22.803
- Come on. I'll even get us real tickets.
- You pack before the concert,

08:22.870 --> 08:25.473
and we leave first thing tomorrow morning.
You got it?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.541
- My word is my bond.
- All right.

08:28.109 --> 08:30.645
- You. Danny wants to see you.
- Why?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.514
He's nervous about
that divisional manager guy stopping by.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.416
- Damn it. Thanks.
- [Chris] Yo, check this out.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.585
Look, look. "Wuz really hood? Two VIP tix",

08:37.652 --> 08:39.754
three hundo, far form the crowd."

08:39.820 --> 08:40.955
I think he meant "from."

08:42.722 --> 08:46.027
Would you pay me $300
if I performed sexual favors on your body?

08:46.794 --> 08:47.794
No one would.

08:48.663 --> 08:49.864
[knocking on door]

08:50.631 --> 08:51.631
Come in. Come in.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.935
Brooke said you wanted to see me?

08:54.001 --> 08:54.936
Come in, come in.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.138
Stop standing in the door
like a fucking weirdo.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.641
Get in here. Shut the door.
I got something I wanna talk to you about.

09:00.708 --> 09:03.110
Hey, you remember
that incident a couple of months ago

09:03.177 --> 09:05.646
involving a stolen shipment
from one of our trucks?

09:06.113 --> 09:08.950
Trucks? I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.452
You didn't think I was gonna find out,
did you?

09:11.786 --> 09:13.554
You're carrying a lot of dead weight.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.156
That fucking friend of yours, Chris?

09:15.690 --> 09:18.693
He's a bum. Which makes you an idiot,
for being friends with him.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.896
Know what he did? He took all that stuff,
he sold it to Organix for...

09:21.963 --> 09:25.166
How much did he tell you he sold it for,
$3,000? What a great deal.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.167
Wrong.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.470
He sold it to Organix for 5 grand.

09:29.537 --> 09:32.106
He kept an extra two grand for himself,
man.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.908
Stings, right?

09:34.175 --> 09:37.745
Your bestie. He fucking stole from you.
You don't even fucking know it.

09:38.646 --> 09:39.580
What do you want?

09:39.647 --> 09:42.650
You owe $5,000 to the store
for food you stole.

09:42.717 --> 09:45.720
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Then you and Chris are fired.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.555
And believe me, I will press charges.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.223
You ever do any time in general pop?

09:49.490 --> 09:51.225
They eat kids like you for breakfast.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.728
So, add that, add your bail,
your lawyer fees,

09:53.794 --> 09:55.896
you getting sodomized in prison every day.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.732
I can call the prosecutor's office.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.134
- I know someone...
- No, no, no. Please.

10:00.201 --> 10:02.603
I'm selling my car in half an hour.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.904
That's $2,500.

10:04.572 --> 10:05.973
It's yours. That's all I've got.

10:11.212 --> 10:13.114
All right, that'll do in the meantime.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.583
- Can I go now?
- You may go now.

10:17.952 --> 10:19.587
I'm fucking crazy, bro.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.789
Man, I don't play like that, Johnny.

10:21.856 --> 10:23.858
Know what I'm saying? I go fucking crazy.

10:23.924 --> 10:27.561
You know, sidekick, bit...
What's good, man? Did you get in trouble?

10:27.628 --> 10:30.531
- We gotta go. Meet me at LAX at 3 p.m.
- What about the concert?

10:30.598 --> 10:33.634
Fuck it. Danny knows about Organix.
He's gonna go to the police.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.804
- What are you talking about?
- Go home, pack, and get your passport.

10:36.871 --> 10:39.173
We'll fly standby if we have to,
but we leave today.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.709
- But I don't have a ride. Shit.
- Cover my register!

10:41.776 --> 10:43.044
[cell phone ringing]

10:44.812 --> 10:46.213
Maloney's my name. Talk to me.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.782
# Dirty ghetto kids #

10:48.282 --> 10:49.784
# Look at what we did #

10:50.251 --> 10:53.220
# Hustled from the crib
We can... a bigger place to live #

10:54.021 --> 10:57.291
# Newest to the shit
Always been the truest to the shit #

10:57.892 --> 11:01.095
# We said we weren't in
Now turn around and look at what we did #

11:01.162 --> 11:02.263
# Look at what we did #

11:03.330 --> 11:06.133
# Yeah, look at what we did
Look at what we did #

11:06.200 --> 11:08.002
# Look at what we did
Look at what we did #

11:08.069 --> 11:10.137
# Look at what we did
Look at what we did #

11:10.204 --> 11:13.040
# I thought my life was bad
No... #

11:14.008 --> 11:15.643
# Appreciate what you have #

11:23.684 --> 11:24.585
Shit.

11:24.652 --> 11:26.220
- Chester, my friend.
- Yeah.

11:26.287 --> 11:27.822
- Hey.
- I'm Carlo.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.824
Oh, hey, Carlo. How's it going?

11:31.692 --> 11:32.732
I'm always, uh, so nervous

11:32.760 --> 11:35.663
to sell stuff on Craigslist,
'cause there's a bunch of weirdos,

11:35.729 --> 11:36.964
but you look totally normal.

11:37.031 --> 11:40.267
Right, there's a lot of weirdos online
trying to take advantage of you.

11:40.935 --> 11:43.070
- Yes.
- You gotta be careful.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.271
- Right.
- Well...

11:44.939 --> 11:47.274
- So, this is it, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:47.341 --> 11:49.076
- I like the way she looks.
- [chuckles]

11:49.143 --> 11:51.212
Like a 45-year-old mom,

11:51.278 --> 11:54.882
- waiting to get fucked.
- I have no idea what that means.

11:54.949 --> 11:56.884
I got a flight to catch
in a couple hours.

11:56.951 --> 11:59.887
- Do you mind if we speed this up?
- It's okay to test drive?

12:00.354 --> 12:01.856
Just to see everything's okay?

12:01.922 --> 12:05.192
Yeah, of course, please. Of course.
You gotta check out the merchandise.

12:05.259 --> 12:06.293
Sorry if that's racist.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.330
- Don't know why I said it.
- I was thinking that you could drive,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.332
and I could ride shotgun. Do you mind?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.200
- No.
- My cousin Rico to ride with us?

12:13.267 --> 12:14.268
[Carlo yells in Spanish]

12:14.335 --> 12:15.335
Your cousin?

12:16.070 --> 12:18.038
- [Carlo speaks in Spanish]
- Very big cousin.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.174
Hi. I'm Chester. Very nice to meet you.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.943
You're almost as big as that truck.
Are those 22's?

12:23.010 --> 12:25.880
It's okay. He's embarrassed.
His English is not very good.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.781
[Chester] Sorry.

12:27.848 --> 12:31.819
I meant the 22's on the truck, not you.
Why would you have rims, right?

12:31.886 --> 12:33.420
[chuckles] That would be crazy.

12:35.089 --> 12:36.156
Hey, Carlo.

12:36.891 --> 12:38.058
[Rico speaks in Spanish]

12:38.726 --> 12:39.960
Hmm?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.763
- Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- You think I'm stupid?

12:42.830 --> 12:44.131
- No, no.
- Is this a stolen car?

12:44.198 --> 12:46.400
- What?
- You tried to sell me a hot car, fucker!

12:46.667 --> 12:48.335
No, not a hot car.
That's not what it is.

12:48.402 --> 12:50.971
Then why is there a suitcase
and bags of shit in it?!

12:51.038 --> 12:53.307
I'm going on vacation.
I told you, I have a flight.

12:53.374 --> 12:56.043
I don't steal vintage cars
and sell them on Craigslist.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.779
I don't do that.
That's not my thing. Please.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.350
[laughing]

13:03.417 --> 13:05.019
[whoops, then speaks in Spanish]

13:05.085 --> 13:07.254
[whoops, then speaks in English]
That was fun, man.

13:07.321 --> 13:11.725
Whoo, jeez, you're so nervous.
I'm just messing with you.

13:11.792 --> 13:15.362
- You need to loosen up. You're so tense.
- [chuckles] Yeah. I'm tense.

13:15.429 --> 13:17.464
"Vintage car!
You said it was a vintage car!"

13:17.731 --> 13:20.701
Oh, that's funny.
You have to tell the jokes onstage.

13:20.768 --> 13:22.703
Like the black guy
who tells jokes onstage.

13:22.770 --> 13:24.371
The black guy, um... What's his name?

13:24.438 --> 13:25.439
Aah! [Speaks in Spanish]

13:25.706 --> 13:27.441
- [in English] He did Delirious.
- Huh?

13:27.708 --> 13:28.708
48 Hrs.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.811
- Mercy.
- Effie... Effie Murky.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.080
- Eddie. Comedian.
- Mer... Merdy.

13:33.147 --> 13:36.116
- No, no.
- Pretty sure it's Eddie Murphy.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.985
No, no, no. Eddie...

13:38.052 --> 13:39.320
- Murphy.
- Merly.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.788
- Murphy.
- Mercy.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.790
- It's Murphy.
- Something like that!

13:42.856 --> 13:43.856
Okay.

13:44.058 --> 13:47.127
Let's just finish the test drive,
then we finalize the sale.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.196
I drive you to the airport, no problem.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.364
- Rico, let's go.
- Great.

13:50.431 --> 13:52.166
Why...? Why is he...?

13:52.833 --> 13:53.867
What is he doing?

13:55.803 --> 13:57.204
- Hey... No...
- [Carlo speaks in Spanish]

13:57.271 --> 13:59.106
- [in English] We're going now. Come on.
- What?

13:59.173 --> 14:01.308
- Why is he in the trunk?
- He likes to be alone.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.309
That's weird.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.879
Is your cousin gonna be fine in the trunk?

14:05.946 --> 14:09.116
[speaking in Spanish,
then man speaking in Spanish over phone]

14:09.750 --> 14:13.354
I couldn't help but notice
your rich Central American accent.

14:13.787 --> 14:17.024
It's just so beautiful,
the way it flows off your tongue.

14:17.091 --> 14:18.092
I mean, what is that?

14:18.158 --> 14:20.461
Belize? Nicaraguan? Salvadorean?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.796
Let's go a little further down.

14:22.863 --> 14:23.931
We are almost there.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.403
[man whistles, then yells indistinctly]

14:29.470 --> 14:31.071
[indistinct chattering]

14:31.805 --> 14:32.805
Shit.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.515
- [cell phone ringing]
- Oh, my boss.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.478
- See? He's such a worrywart.
- Turn it off.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.447
He'll probably send out an amber alert
if I don't check in.

14:41.482 --> 14:44.084
I never know how
to mute these things, actually.

14:44.385 --> 14:45.886
[chuckling]

14:45.953 --> 14:47.054
Okay, yeah.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.422
- Okay, very funny.
- [whistling]

14:48.856 --> 14:50.991
Can we not do this while I drive? Please?

14:51.058 --> 14:53.861
I have a phobia about things
going near my eye. It's... [gasps]

14:55.229 --> 14:58.098
Please, don't do this, okay?
You want the car, it's your car.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.000
I won't tell the cops. Just let me go.

15:00.501 --> 15:01.468
[American accent]
I don't want the car.

15:01.535 --> 15:02.970
See that pink house?

15:03.037 --> 15:06.273
Wait, what happened to your accent?
Why would you fake an accent?

15:06.340 --> 15:08.375
Because it made you feel more comfortable.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.478
That's really a social commentary
on why you're more empathetic

15:11.545 --> 15:16.317
to people who speak with accents.
Now I'm gonna ask you one more time.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.153
You're gonna slowly pull up
to that pink house,

15:19.219 --> 15:22.256
and on my cue, you'll drive away fast.

15:22.890 --> 15:23.891
Can you do that?

15:25.259 --> 15:26.360
You mean the purple one?

15:26.894 --> 15:29.196
- It's pink.
- No, that's more of a mauve if anything.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.898
- It's fucking pink.
- To be honest,

15:30.964 --> 15:33.367
I'm not the best for this job.
I'm a great team leader.

15:33.434 --> 15:34.568
My résumé speaks to that.

15:34.835 --> 15:38.172
But being a getaway driver is not one
of my strong points... Strong suits.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.238
Is that a yes?

15:39.840 --> 15:42.543
Yes. I'm feeling very spontaneous today.
Let's do it. Yeah.

15:45.913 --> 15:48.949
[man 1] Can't wait for you to see what
I got my mom for Mother's Day, man.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.517
[man 2] I forgot that was coming, blood.

15:50.584 --> 15:51.585
- Damn.
- [man 1] What?

15:51.852 --> 15:54.021
- You ain't got Mama something?
- [man 2] No.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.223
Out of all my favorite beaches,

15:56.290 --> 15:58.158
I'm fucking with Hermosa the most, man.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.494
[man 2] Hell, no, nigga. That Caesar.

16:00.561 --> 16:02.062
[man 1] Not pizzas.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.099
- I said, out of all the beaches and shit.
- [man 2] Oh, you said beaches.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.533
[man 1] Yeah. [Laughs]

16:06.600 --> 16:08.121
- [man 2] What the hell?
- Blood, my...

16:08.168 --> 16:10.104
Oh. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

16:10.571 --> 16:11.905
[man 1] What's cracking, coz?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.242
- What you looking at?
- I ain't never seen that car

16:15.309 --> 16:16.477
on the street before.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.911
[Carlo] Now, on my cue,

16:18.379 --> 16:19.613
you pop the trunk.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.248
- Got it?
- Got it.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.016
One.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.654
Two.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.193
Three. Now!

16:39.466 --> 16:41.402
Guatemalan boys say hello!

16:42.569 --> 16:43.670
[Carlo laughing]

16:47.341 --> 16:49.476
[laughing]

17:03.657 --> 17:04.958
Pull off! Pull off!

17:05.459 --> 17:06.393
[tires squealing]

17:06.460 --> 17:07.460
Take that!

17:08.962 --> 17:10.196
[Chester] Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:10.263 --> 17:11.263
Motherfucker!

17:13.066 --> 17:16.069
- Can't this piece of shit go faster?!
- I fucking hate Craigslist!

17:16.136 --> 17:17.337
Go!

17:17.404 --> 17:18.404
[Chester screaming]

17:20.040 --> 17:22.075
Don't slow down.
What the fuck are you doing?

17:22.142 --> 17:24.011
Sorry, Carlo. Just give me one second.

17:28.449 --> 17:29.450
I'm sorry about that.

17:29.983 --> 17:30.651
I'm sorry.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.717
Oh, God.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.122
From now on, when I say "don't pull over,"

17:35.189 --> 17:36.623
and you pull over,

17:36.690 --> 17:39.626
I am going to consider that disobedience.

17:39.693 --> 17:43.163
And what do you do
when a dog disobeys you?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.702
You put that bitch down.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.473
Now...

17:54.341 --> 17:56.076
you're gonna drop us off at our car.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.345
[Rico and Carlo speaking in Spanish]

18:00.447 --> 18:02.516
- [in English] Okay.
- Let's go.

18:03.584 --> 18:05.486
[Carlo speaking in Spanish]

18:05.552 --> 18:07.421
[Rico laughing, then Carlo laughing]

18:09.289 --> 18:12.593
[Carlo speaking in Spanish]

18:14.628 --> 18:16.296
[in English]
Whoa. Where are you going?

18:16.363 --> 18:17.431
[Chester] A shortcut.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.468
The streets in L.A. are a death trap,
so, I'm taking the highway.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.270
Trust me, this is the fastest route.

18:23.737 --> 18:25.038
[Carlo] You better be right.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.413
[car horns honking]

18:36.049 --> 18:37.284
[Carlo sighs] Faster, huh?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.686
How was I supposed
to know there's construction?

18:41.121 --> 18:44.124
You know, they should invent an app
that tells you if a highway's

18:44.191 --> 18:46.593
backed up due to construction,
and how to take detours.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.662
- That's a smart idea. That's...
- That's Waze.

18:48.729 --> 18:50.697
You just described
the most popular map app

18:50.764 --> 18:53.667
that was bought by Google
for 1.2 billion dollars.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.104
[both speaking in Spanish]

18:57.337 --> 18:59.106
[in English]
One-point-three. Gracias, Rico.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.476
You guys are pretty current
with the, uh, Silicon Valley news.

19:02.543 --> 19:04.278
That's... That's impressive.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.381
We love reading about app mergers.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.682
Get off this exit.

19:09.683 --> 19:10.683
Okay.

19:12.286 --> 19:13.720
Oh, hey, come on, dude.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.659
See this? Typical L.A. driver, man.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.527
- Probably late to his audition.
- [car horn honks]

19:20.594 --> 19:23.764
- Hey, man, easy on the horn.
- [Chester] You're not gonna get the part.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.030
- [car horn honking]
- Come on.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.433
[horn continues honking]

19:26.500 --> 19:27.534
Easy on the horn!

19:27.601 --> 19:30.070
There's a million other actors like you.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.272
- It's not going for you.
- It's not going for me?

19:32.339 --> 19:35.342
You know,
I'm driving a V-8 drop-top Bentley.

19:35.409 --> 19:37.544
So, yeah, it's going for me pretty well.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.314
What's up with your car?
Is that real leather? Doubt it.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.848
What, is that plastic? [Chuckling]

19:42.115 --> 19:44.251
This is a 1997 vintage car.

19:44.318 --> 19:47.187
He thinks he's better than me
'cause he drives imported shit?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.655
When you talk shit about people,

19:48.722 --> 19:51.625
you should roll up your window.
Might have to do it manually.

19:51.692 --> 19:52.826
You know, manually?

19:53.093 --> 19:53.794
You know that word?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.329
When you talk shit to someone

19:55.395 --> 19:56.496
on the freeway, - Stop.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.132
Make sure you're
not driving a $100,000 car!

19:59.199 --> 20:00.479
- I dare you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:01.368 --> 20:02.769
- [banging and glass breaking]
- Fuck!

20:02.836 --> 20:04.771
- You kidding me?
- See what you made me do?

20:04.838 --> 20:06.840
- Shit!
- I made you do?

20:07.107 --> 20:09.209
- I'm crazy when I drive.
- Didn't see a car?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.378
- Don't talk shit to someone.
- Out of the car.

20:11.445 --> 20:14.414
- I take melatonin every night.
- Hey, hey, hey! Get in the car!

20:14.481 --> 20:17.184
- [Carlo yelling in Spanish]
- Hey!

20:17.250 --> 20:18.418
What's happening?

20:20.721 --> 20:22.222
[continues yelling in Spanish]

20:22.656 --> 20:23.790
[in English] It doesn't matter.

20:23.857 --> 20:25.792
[horns honking]

20:26.426 --> 20:27.761
Fuck. Fuck.

20:29.630 --> 20:30.864
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

20:31.732 --> 20:32.732
Come on.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.371
[door bells ringing]

20:37.437 --> 20:39.306
[music playing over speaker]

20:54.454 --> 20:55.689
Stapler? No...

21:13.874 --> 21:15.242
The truck.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.844
[dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

21:17.911 --> 21:20.781
I was robbed at gunpoint
by two Guatemalans in a pickup truck.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.849
They stole my car
and are trying to kill me.

21:22.916 --> 21:25.819
- Hold, sir. I'll transfer your call.
- No. Don't put me on hold.

21:25.886 --> 21:28.855
- Sir, it'll just be a second.
- No. Don't put me... [grunts]

21:28.922 --> 21:30.457
Fine. I'm dead.

21:30.524 --> 21:31.524
[hissing]

21:36.496 --> 21:37.964
[Johnny] Hey, Chris.

21:39.433 --> 21:41.401
Rise and shine, man.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.571
It's a beautiful morning.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.675
[Johnny laughing]

21:50.377 --> 21:51.377
- Ow!
- [Johnny chuckles]

21:51.411 --> 21:52.879
- You should see...
- What the fuck?

21:52.946 --> 21:54.648
- Piece of shit.
- [laughing]

21:54.715 --> 21:56.283
- You trying to get up?
- Get off!

21:56.349 --> 21:58.485
- You trying to get up? [Whoops]
- Get out of my room!

21:58.552 --> 22:01.621
- Your face looks like my asshole!
- Fuck you!

22:08.428 --> 22:10.530
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.666
You're the best. I never feel it.

22:13.266 --> 22:16.803
Hey, I just posted that video.
It's already got like 15,000 loops.

22:16.870 --> 22:17.870
Check it out, Patti.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.519
[Chris over cell phone] Ow!

22:19.573 --> 22:21.541
- What the fuck?
- [laughing] Look at his face.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.344
- You look like a paraplegic. Doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.779
You mean quadriplegic?

22:25.846 --> 22:27.881
Paraplegic has nothing to do
with the face.

22:27.948 --> 22:29.516
Oh. "You mean quadriplegic?"

22:29.583 --> 22:31.818
Paraplegic has nothing
to do with the face."

22:32.519 --> 22:33.753
[blowing raspberry]

22:34.855 --> 22:35.889
[Johnny] Holy shit.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.493
Are you seeing this spot-on impression
Patti's doing of you?

22:39.559 --> 22:42.529
I'm seeing double over here.
Nicely done, Patti. Keep it coming.

22:42.963 --> 22:44.264
[chuckles] So...

22:44.731 --> 22:46.933
another glorious day at work
coming for you, huh?

22:48.268 --> 22:50.971
You psyched
to break down cardboard boxes,

22:51.037 --> 22:53.874
and stock the shelves with cans all day?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.542
Get a high-protein breakfast in.

22:55.609 --> 22:57.611
Don't run out of steam,
all that hard labor.

22:57.677 --> 23:00.647
You learned sarcasm at the ripe age of 35.
Good for you, Johnny.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.383
Just move out and get a real job.
No one wants you here.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.052
Why don't you get a real job?
I'll get one when you get one.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.388
I'm a diabetic, asshole.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.925
- I have to live with Mom and Dad.
- How's the tallboy treating your diabetes?

23:11.992 --> 23:13.860
[beeper beeping]

23:13.927 --> 23:14.927
Hold that thought.

23:14.995 --> 23:16.997
[sniffles] Whoops.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.465
I just made 300 bucks.

23:18.532 --> 23:19.533
What are you scalping?

23:19.933 --> 23:23.370
- Strokes tickets at the Greek.
- Are they even real?

23:24.337 --> 23:26.940
Yeah, they're totally real.
They're Ticketmaster approved.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.442
[mimics crying, then explosion]

23:29.509 --> 23:30.944
- All over your face.
- Is that what

23:31.011 --> 23:33.413
- you sound like when you're coming?
- Yeah.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.350
[beeper beeping] Excuse me.
You wanna go to that Rock the Bells show?

23:37.417 --> 23:38.852
I got two tickets I gotta unload.

23:38.919 --> 23:41.454
But it was sold out four months ago.
How much?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.389
For you?

23:42.455 --> 23:43.323
Brotherly price.

23:43.390 --> 23:44.591
[clicking tongue]

23:44.658 --> 23:45.592
Three hundred bucks.

23:45.659 --> 23:48.495
Come on. I can't afford that.
Just give 'em to me for free.

23:48.562 --> 23:50.797
Check Craigslist.
These are going for 800 minimum.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.667
- But your tickets are fake.
- The concert's gonna be so huge,

23:53.733 --> 23:55.869
you just show up,
they'll glance at your ticket,

23:55.936 --> 23:56.937
and let you go in.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.506
This is my area of expertise now.

23:59.573 --> 24:02.042
If I wanted to know the price
on some shitty meat

24:02.108 --> 24:03.476
in the meat market,

24:03.877 --> 24:05.111
I'd probably ask you.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.680
[sniffles, then clears throat]

24:06.746 --> 24:10.383
- 'Cause that's your profession, dipshit.
- I'll give you 100 for two.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.785
Blow my dick with your mouth.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.453
You hear that, Patti?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.956
- Johnny wants me to suck his dick.
- Chris. Language.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.626
Watch what you say in front of Patti,
you disrespectful cunt.

24:19.693 --> 24:21.061
- [music playing over speaker]
- [Johnny] Oh, shit.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.430
Oh, shit. We're nailing this.

24:24.431 --> 24:25.498
Oh, my God. Yeah.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.565
We're in the pocket.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.134
So snug.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.103
[safe beeping]

24:40.547 --> 24:42.582
[music continues playing]

24:43.383 --> 24:45.085
- Perfect. Perfect so far.
- [car horn honking]

24:45.151 --> 24:46.151
What is that?

24:46.720 --> 24:47.754
Shut up!

24:49.456 --> 24:51.758
Wait. Okay. All right.
Pause it, pause it, pause it.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.161
Come on. What was that?
We were having a perfect game.

24:55.428 --> 24:58.465
Oh, the idiot.
Your drumming was incredible, by the way.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.967
Keep up that intensity when we unpause.
Hey, Chris!

25:03.870 --> 25:04.870
Chris!

25:06.539 --> 25:09.909
Your dyke friend's here
to pick you up in his dogshit car.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.845
Tell him to stop honking his whack horn.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.980
He's ruining our game. Wait.

25:20.854 --> 25:21.955
Were you in my room?

25:22.022 --> 25:23.723
No, you paranoid fuck.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.426
- Stay out of my shit.
- Nobody's in your shit, Johnny.

25:26.493 --> 25:29.062
You're poking around in my shit.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.031
[whispering]
And I don't like it.

25:31.631 --> 25:34.968
You're sniffing around...
[sniffing] sniffing my shit.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.803
- Why are you whispering?
- Why are you?

25:36.870 --> 25:38.638
- You are.
- You sniffing around my shit

25:38.705 --> 25:40.106
- makes me so mad.
- Don't worry.

25:40.173 --> 25:41.207
- Out of my shit.
- Stop.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.443
- Stay out of my shit.
- Stop whispering.

25:43.510 --> 25:45.945
- I'm not whispering. You are.
- I'm not whispering.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.448
You stay out of my shit.

25:48.515 --> 25:50.684
- Stop it.
- Stay out of my shit.

25:52.185 --> 25:53.185
Bye, Patti.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.720
Fuck you.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.754
Come on.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.224
All right, Patti.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.160
Sack up, we're going back in.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.097
- Feels like the game's cheating, right?
- Yeah, it is.

26:04.164 --> 26:05.532
I'm gonna sue Xbox.

26:05.598 --> 26:06.879
[Chester speaking in Portuguese]

26:06.933 --> 26:07.933
Let's go, let's go!

26:09.669 --> 26:11.538
Cool. Hey, don't slam the door.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.574
- Don't slam the...
- What the fuck are you listening to?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.976
I'm not going to a concert
with his fake tickets.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.079
Sell 'em
and get your car out of the impound.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.047
- Grow up.
- [woman] You have a very bright future

26:21.114 --> 26:22.582
ahead of you, Chris.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.218
This is how you come at me
this early in the morning, Greg?

26:25.485 --> 26:27.554
Why don't you ask about
my grandma's dementia?

26:27.620 --> 26:30.657
Dude, that was rude of me.
Too early for that, you're right. My B.

26:30.724 --> 26:32.258
You wanna hear something messed up?

26:32.525 --> 26:34.794
I got two tickets
to Rock the Bells going to waste.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.596
That's 500 bucks down the drain.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.631
Two? I've been looking all over for those.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.900
- I checked StubHub and everything. 500?
- Here.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.802
That's way too much. I won't touch 'em

26:42.869 --> 26:46.139
- until you give me a better price.
- I mean, I can do it for you for 300.

26:46.206 --> 26:47.240
- Three hundred?
- Yeah.

26:47.507 --> 26:48.508
Oh, shit.

26:52.212 --> 26:54.581
- Yo, what...? Yo, what the fuck?
- What?

26:55.048 --> 26:56.916
Why you trying to sell me fake tickets?

26:56.983 --> 26:58.518
- What?
- I thought we were cool.

26:58.585 --> 26:59.886
I just took you to Jamba Juice

26:59.953 --> 27:02.622
and bought you a ginger shot.
Ginger shots aren't cheap.

27:02.689 --> 27:05.525
You think I'm the ginger fairy?
Like ginger grows on trees?

27:05.592 --> 27:07.927
Out of all people,
I know how much ginger shots cost.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.630
It's an expensive addition to a smoothie.
I get that.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.767
I'm just trying to sell you great tickets
to an amazing event.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.535
I feel like Jesus over here.

27:15.602 --> 27:18.138
I'm trying to give you something
and I'm being persecuted.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.807
Really? Jesus was scalping tickets
for the Last Supper?

27:20.874 --> 27:23.143
If you don't want 'em, good.
Deal's off. Forget it.

27:23.209 --> 27:26.946
Those are fake. I know they are.
The real ones have a security foil on 'em.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.114
Those aren't real.

27:28.181 --> 27:30.116
Real or fake, no one's gonna give a shit.

27:30.183 --> 27:33.253
There'll be so many people there,
security's just gonna let you in.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.055
Do I look like a sucker-ass nigga?
Don't answer that.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.591
Two friends got caught
with fake tickets last year.

27:38.658 --> 27:39.692
Security did them in.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.695
My first friend, broken leg.
He can't even walk right now.

27:42.762 --> 27:43.963
Second friend, dead.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.933
I don't know your friends.
They might have weak immune systems.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
I gotta go.

27:49.636 --> 27:50.970
- [Chester] Why?
- I think he's nervous

27:51.037 --> 27:52.939
about that divisional manager guy
stopping by.

27:53.873 --> 27:59.012
Check this out. Look. "Wuz really hood?
Two VIP tix, 3 hundo, far form the crowd."

27:59.078 --> 28:01.881
- I think he meant "from."
- [Chester] Go pack, get your passport.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.250
We'll fly standby if we have to,
but we leave today.

28:04.317 --> 28:06.786
- But I don't have a ride. Shit.
- Cover my register!

28:06.853 --> 28:09.088
[cell phone ringing]

28:09.722 --> 28:11.024
Maloney's my name. Talk to me.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.093
- [man] Yo, you called me about tickets?
- Yeah, yeah. You still got 'em?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.830
Yeah, I got 'em.
Don't call me on that sexy voice shit.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.966
Three hundred for both of 'em
and don't come here on some bullshit.

28:20.033 --> 28:20.900
Where do you live?

28:20.967 --> 28:23.203
Valley. 450 Vesper off Ventura.
Don't be late.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.205
- I'll see you in an hour.
- Yeah. Hurry up.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.007
I'm so sorry.
Our card machine's actually not working.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.342
Do you have cash?

28:31.377 --> 28:33.012
[groans] Sorry.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.215
Those eyes got me. [Chuckles]

28:36.382 --> 28:37.684
Thank you so much.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.221
What are you doing?

28:42.789 --> 28:45.325
Nothing. Yo, if Danny asks for me,
I'm going to get lunch.

28:46.126 --> 28:47.227
It's not even 9:30.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.135
[Chris] Five,

28:55.201 --> 28:56.836
six,

28:56.903 --> 28:58.071
seven...

28:59.139 --> 29:00.139
Eight hundred.

29:17.290 --> 29:18.825
[sighs] What's up, baby?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.094
What's up, baby? It's all good, brother.

29:21.161 --> 29:22.195
It's all good, baby.

29:22.262 --> 29:23.897
He's not Maloney. You're Maloney.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.365
Be fucking Maloney.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.674
Is that your black Range Rover outside?

29:37.010 --> 29:38.010
That's Jay's.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.112
Cool.

29:41.981 --> 29:45.151
I'm just wondering, 'cause,
like, I'm in the market for one, so...

29:45.818 --> 29:49.088
Like, that or a Lambo.
Just something to fit my character.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.331
Just... Just stop talking.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.800
- [moaning on computer]
- [Jay] One.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.001
Two.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.236
Three.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.470
Four.

30:04.737 --> 30:05.737
Five.

30:05.772 --> 30:06.873
Six.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.342
[grunting]

30:09.409 --> 30:12.045
- [woman] Jay!
- Fuck you. [Grunts]

30:12.111 --> 30:14.847
- Jay, get the fuck out here!
- Goddamn it.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.218
- [door slams]
- Hey, yo, what the fuck did I say?

30:18.284 --> 30:21.254
When that door's closed,
don't bother me, don't text me.

30:21.321 --> 30:23.723
- Nothing.
- [scoffs]

30:23.790 --> 30:25.458
Hey, yo, hand me that robe real quick.

30:26.793 --> 30:27.894
Oh, yeah.

30:29.762 --> 30:32.065
- Put that on, ma'am.
- Do I look fucking cold to you?

30:33.967 --> 30:34.967
[scoffs]

30:35.001 --> 30:36.001
Whatever.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.403
What the fuck you looking at?

30:37.470 --> 30:38.470
Nothing.

30:38.838 --> 30:42.108
- I'm just here for the tickets.
- Oh, you that silly motherfucker

30:42.175 --> 30:45.178
that called me with the sexy-ass voice.
Yo, last two I got, man.

30:45.778 --> 30:48.414
Don't fucking put
your sausage fingerprints all over them.

30:48.481 --> 30:50.283
All right? It depreciates the value.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.786
Are these really VIP?
I mean, I know it says it on the tickets,

30:53.853 --> 30:56.155
but there's a lot of,
like, fake VIPs going around...

30:56.222 --> 30:57.222
Oh, okay.

30:57.991 --> 31:00.960
I bet you think all Asian people bootleg

31:01.027 --> 31:03.830
DVDs, Louis bags, concert tickets?

31:03.896 --> 31:06.499
Racist motherfucker.
Get out of here. Give my tickets back.

31:06.766 --> 31:08.334
I've never bought a fake Louis bag,

31:08.401 --> 31:11.838
so, I wouldn't know what the ethnicity
of that person would be, really.

31:11.904 --> 31:12.904
I don't... You know?

31:13.106 --> 31:15.141
I've heard it's a specific type.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.542
No, no. No, no.

31:17.110 --> 31:18.378
I just, you know...

31:20.847 --> 31:22.882
- No.
- [chuckles]

31:24.217 --> 31:26.119
What the fuck are you laughing at?

31:27.820 --> 31:29.155
Yo, what's your problem?

31:29.222 --> 31:30.823
You really want me to say it?

31:33.393 --> 31:36.496
Every time we say we're gonna...

31:38.965 --> 31:40.366
you have something going on.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.469
- What's the Wi-Fi here?
- I don't take care of that pussy?

31:43.536 --> 31:45.004
It's okay. I have LTE.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.272
[scoffs]

31:46.339 --> 31:49.008
Okay. Yeah, you start some shit,
but you can't finish it

31:49.075 --> 31:51.944
when shit gets real, right? You scared.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.011
You scared, right?

31:53.446 --> 31:55.315
Jay, I'm not the one that's scared.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.150
Now get the fuck out of my way.

31:57.817 --> 31:59.452
You touch me again, we have a problem.

31:59.519 --> 32:02.155
- Hey, hey, take it easy.
- Get the fuck off of me.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.057
- Asshole.
- Let's try Ujjayi breathing.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.426
Inhale through the nose,
exhale through the mouth,

32:06.492 --> 32:08.394
- like to fog up a window.
- [cell phone rings]

32:08.461 --> 32:10.930
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Yo, down the hall, man.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.566
What the fuck do you want?

32:19.405 --> 32:20.405
[lock clicks]

32:31.317 --> 32:32.585
What's up, baby? What's up?

32:32.852 --> 32:35.488
- Ain't shit. Fuck him. Fuck him.
- [banging on door]

32:35.555 --> 32:37.890
- Yo, what's up, man?
- [Jay] Yo, what you doing in there?

32:37.957 --> 32:40.860
- I'm just finishing up.
- I gotta bounce, so, hurry the fuck up.

32:43.563 --> 32:46.866
Make sure he pays for the tickets.
I gotta drop this off real quick.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.435
Hey, yo.
Make sure he pays for the tickets.

32:49.502 --> 32:50.436
I'm talking to you.

32:50.503 --> 32:52.372
I heard you the first time. Jesus.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.475
- What did I just say to do?
- I'll get him to pay for the tickets.

32:56.509 --> 32:57.509
Great.

32:58.311 --> 33:00.613
Thank you for treating me
like a fucking adult. [Grunts]

33:01.314 --> 33:02.215
[groans]

33:02.281 --> 33:03.281
[water runs, then stops]

33:18.398 --> 33:20.233
Oh, what the fuck?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.301
Oh, shit.

33:38.151 --> 33:40.019
What the fuck?

33:50.430 --> 33:51.464
Where's Jay?

33:51.531 --> 33:54.066
He had to step out.
You want these tickets?

33:54.600 --> 33:57.437
Uh... Yeah,
I just actually got a call from work,

33:57.503 --> 33:59.605
- and I gotta work the double.
- That sucks.

34:01.207 --> 34:04.210
I was just kidding what I said before
about the Lambo thing.

34:05.678 --> 34:06.678
What?

34:07.213 --> 34:08.347
Remember when I was like,

34:08.481 --> 34:12.217
"Oh, I wanna get a Range Rover or a Lambo
or something that'd fit my character."

34:12.284 --> 34:13.485
I was just kidding.

34:13.553 --> 34:15.388
I would never buy any of those cars.

34:15.455 --> 34:18.991
Not 'cause I think they're douchey,
just 'cause, like, I can't afford 'em.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.694
Kind of a douche already.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.364
Did you laugh?

34:27.967 --> 34:29.235
Pretty sure that was a laugh.

34:29.335 --> 34:30.268
[chuckles]

34:30.335 --> 34:32.737
See, I'm not that bad
when you give me a chance, right?

34:34.474 --> 34:35.474
Um...

34:35.507 --> 34:37.677
So, are you gonna go
to the concert later or...?

34:38.377 --> 34:41.147
Uh... I don't know.
I might go with one of my girls.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.649
You should give me a call if you do.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.485
Um...

34:55.995 --> 34:57.196
I saw this in a movie once.

34:58.164 --> 35:01.267
- What happened after?
- He gets killed by her boyfriend.

35:01.734 --> 35:04.036
Fingers crossed
it works out better for you.

35:08.241 --> 35:10.281
[Danny] Could've used a little more luck
last night.

35:10.309 --> 35:12.545
- I'll say that much for sure.
- [man] No fucking kidding.

35:12.612 --> 35:15.648
Dodgers had to break their winning streak
the night I bet on them.

35:15.715 --> 35:18.217
Fucking bullshit, but whatever.
Win some, lose some.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.786
Yeah, you're shit out of luck.
I'll be there in an hour.

35:21.053 --> 35:22.622
Oh, word, you're coming over, bro?

35:22.688 --> 35:24.657
- Can you bring me, like, a baggie?
- Baggie?

35:24.724 --> 35:26.192
You got my three racks, fool?

35:26.259 --> 35:28.761
I got so many racks,
I ought to open a Home Depot.

35:29.028 --> 35:30.596
- Feel me?
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.164
Shit.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.772
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:40.039 --> 35:41.039
Shit.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.378
[Danny] Come on, man. Don't... Shit.

35:45.444 --> 35:46.679
Jay, don't...

35:46.746 --> 35:48.180
Come on, don't do this, bro.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.610
Fucking economy's bullshit.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.145
Jay, hey.

36:19.312 --> 36:21.147
I didn't know you were coming so soon.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.081
That's, uh...

36:22.214 --> 36:24.383
Anybody ever tell you
you're really prompt?

36:24.450 --> 36:26.385
It's a great quality. It's a great, good.

36:26.452 --> 36:28.387
Means you're considerate and, like,

36:28.454 --> 36:30.790
that means that you must come from,
like, you know...

36:31.357 --> 36:34.727
You must've been raised
in a really nice family.

36:34.794 --> 36:37.563
You know? You gotta come from good stock.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.636
Let's do business now.

36:43.703 --> 36:45.671
So, that's all you. That's...

36:45.738 --> 36:47.139
That's you right there.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.542
What the fuck is that?

36:49.609 --> 36:50.843
I know, I know.

36:51.110 --> 36:54.614
It's... That's... It's for the coke.
And I was gonna pay you the $3,000 later.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.317
So, let me get this straight,
'cause maybe I'm a little slow today.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.887
You expect me to drive all the way
back from the valley

37:02.154 --> 37:04.824
to get the rest of my money,
you delinquent fuck?

37:05.424 --> 37:08.194
You know what?
You're taking the 405, that's the problem.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.295
If you take Coldwater...

37:09.362 --> 37:12.164
You're telling me my problem
is I'm using my Waze app wrong?

37:13.799 --> 37:16.268
You know what happens
when you don't have my money?

37:16.335 --> 37:19.372
Yes, I remember very clearly.
Looks like I have a C-section scar.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.640
Thanks for that.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.575
So, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

37:24.143 --> 37:26.712
Do you have all my motherfucking money?

37:26.779 --> 37:30.149
Yes, I do. Not now.
But I will have it later.

37:30.216 --> 37:32.151
I have a lot of things moving around now,

37:32.218 --> 37:35.888
and I will have it by 1:00 at the latest.

37:36.822 --> 37:38.157
Swear to God.

37:39.191 --> 37:40.191
Latest.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.760
One o'clock.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.234
Did I say 1? I meant 12.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.603
At the latest, 11...

37:51.904 --> 37:52.938
thirty.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.707
Or now.

37:54.774 --> 37:57.343
Let me get...
I'm gonna get you some money right now.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.477
Yeah?

38:00.780 --> 38:03.649
Want a Kombucha, or something?
Hook you up? You good?

38:06.185 --> 38:07.553
[Greg] Next customer in line, please.

38:07.620 --> 38:10.790
- All right, you got your...
- This register is closed. Take this stuff.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.758
- Go, go. Go away.
- Hey, Danny. What's up?

38:12.825 --> 38:15.828
Aisle Three needs some extra fifties
and singles and shit.

38:15.895 --> 38:19.398
- Okay. Let me tally up this register.
- No, just give me whatever's there.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.434
Doesn't matter. I'll count in the office.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.536
- Want the change?
- No, I don't need change.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.272
The only change I'd like is
in your damn attitude.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.941
- Okay.
- [mouths] What?

38:29.608 --> 38:32.945
[Danny] Brooke, tally up the receipts,
except Greg's, I just took money out.

38:33.212 --> 38:35.281
- Okay, calm down.
- You calm down. I'm calm.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.450
I'm calm as a motherfucking cucumber.

38:39.251 --> 38:40.251
Eight hundred.

38:41.454 --> 38:42.454
Nine hundred.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.325
Thousand. I got a thousand dollars.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.627
That's a thousand dollars for you
right here.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.495
Stand up.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.765
- Why? Come on.
- Stand the fuck up.

38:52.832 --> 38:56.402
- I got $1000 for you. Don't do this.
- Stand the fuck up. Get the fuck up.

38:56.469 --> 38:59.338
I took the old-school SATs.
You know the 1600 one?

38:59.405 --> 39:01.874
That's really good, man.
I didn't even take the SATs.

39:01.941 --> 39:05.778
I bet your ass thinks I got
a perfect 800 score in math, right?

39:05.845 --> 39:08.614
No, I don't... I didn't think anything.
Man, I'm colorblind

39:08.681 --> 39:11.484
when it comes to stereotypes.
I thought you were Lithuanian.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.618
Here's our options.

39:12.685 --> 39:15.921
A, maybe I'm not good at math,
and this is my fault.

39:15.988 --> 39:16.922
Or, B, - Ow.

39:16.989 --> 39:20.259
You're really good at math,
and you'll teach me something new today

39:20.326 --> 39:23.596
and give me a reason why I shouldn't
shoot one of your fucking nuts off.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.998
- Now, how much did I say you owe me?
- Three thousand.

39:26.265 --> 39:28.033
And how much do you have on you right now?

39:28.300 --> 39:29.300
Well, a thousand.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.570
No. Don't do that, man. Give me an hour.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.306
You know I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it, bro.

39:36.675 --> 39:37.675
An hour.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.751
[Danny] Just give me three grand.
What's the big deal?

39:45.818 --> 39:47.520
I know you need it. I need it more.

39:47.987 --> 39:50.723
I'm not...
No, I'm not gambling again, you idiot.

39:50.790 --> 39:53.425
I'll pay you back.
All right, forget it. Fuck you, Ma.

39:53.492 --> 39:56.061
Hope you like retirement homes.
That's where I'll send you.

39:56.328 --> 39:58.998
What's up, Jay? You got a problem?
You got a problem with me?

39:59.498 --> 40:00.599
I don't got your cash.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.868
So, what you gonna do? Yeah.

40:02.935 --> 40:05.404
That's what I thought, man.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.339
[grunting]

40:08.908 --> 40:11.744
[grunting]

40:11.911 --> 40:14.747
[man speaking indistinctly over TV]
[continues grunting]

40:17.082 --> 40:18.384
Fuck.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.688
- Oh! God. Are you serious?
- What's up, girl?

40:23.455 --> 40:27.092
Just getting a late morning workout in.
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

40:27.359 --> 40:30.930
I'm good. You told me to remind you that
Carey Winters is stopping by tomorrow.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.064
So, I'm reminding you.

40:32.331 --> 40:34.700
Fuck Carey Winters!
Cat thinks he can come around

40:34.767 --> 40:38.504
whenever he wants
to check up on me like I'm a little boy.

40:38.838 --> 40:40.372
This boy's all grown up!

40:40.439 --> 40:42.808
- That's great. I'll see you later.
- Oh, Brooke.

40:44.376 --> 40:47.079
Do you have $3,000 I can borrow?

40:47.346 --> 40:49.381
I'm 19 and I work here.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.617
Do you know anybody who has it?

40:51.684 --> 40:54.386
- A bank.
- Fucking funny. Get the fuck out.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.821
- My pleasure.
- Hey, Brooke.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.425
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.528
[inhales deeply, then exhales]
I'm under a lot of pressure.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.569
[woman] I have a big family that loves
to eat. That's why we shop at Organix.

41:06.999 --> 41:09.068
They've got low prices
and weekly specials.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.538
All of their food is sourced
from local farmers.

41:14.073 --> 41:15.641
Brooke, could you be a princess

41:15.708 --> 41:18.510
and go tell Chester to come in here
and see me, please?

41:19.845 --> 41:21.080
Organix.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.682
They're not just a name, they stand by it.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.918
- Danny wants to see you.
- Why?

41:25.985 --> 41:27.152
I don't have that money.

41:27.419 --> 41:29.088
- Then you and Chris are fired.
- No.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.824
No, no, no.
I'm selling my car in half an hour.

41:31.891 --> 41:33.492
It's yours. That's all I've got.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.895
All right. That'll do in the meantime.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.636
- Where you been?
- Chris.

41:44.637 --> 41:47.039
- I've been texting you for an hour.
- We need a... Okay.

41:47.439 --> 41:48.741
I just had my car stolen, man.

41:48.807 --> 41:52.411
- What? Who'd wanna steal that bucket?
- I don't know. He didn't give a reason

41:52.478 --> 41:54.813
before he forced me
to be an accessory in a drive-by.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.182
We gotta get out before Danny sees me,
so, let's go.

41:57.449 --> 41:58.449
Before we do that,

41:58.484 --> 42:00.552
I got something
I know is gonna cheer you up.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.822
Con...?
I can't go to a concert right now, man.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.758
I just lost my car,

42:05.824 --> 42:07.626
all my... All my stuff.

42:07.726 --> 42:10.429
- All my stuff.
- No, no. Listen. I bought us real tickets.

42:10.496 --> 42:11.496
And we're just...

42:11.864 --> 42:13.732
We're not gonna go to Brazil right now.

42:13.799 --> 42:15.634
How did you get money for the tickets?

42:15.701 --> 42:17.736
Don't worry about that.
These are paid for.

42:21.140 --> 42:22.908
Yeah. Fine. Fuck it, let's go.

42:22.975 --> 42:24.109
- I love you.
- Whoa, okay.

42:24.810 --> 42:25.844
Wow.

42:25.911 --> 42:26.946
Okay, we get the joke.

42:27.613 --> 42:28.781
Don't be homophobic.

42:36.755 --> 42:37.755
Huh.

42:38.991 --> 42:39.991
[knocking on door]

42:41.193 --> 42:42.761
I'm working. Go away.

42:43.762 --> 42:45.564
[knocking on door]

42:45.631 --> 42:46.631
Fuck.

42:50.169 --> 42:51.036
Danny.

42:51.103 --> 42:52.504
Long time. How are you?

42:52.571 --> 42:54.473
Ah. Mr. Winters.

42:55.975 --> 42:57.176
What, are you a germophobe?

42:57.242 --> 42:59.845
- A little. Little bit, yeah.
- [laughs] I like it, I like it.

42:59.912 --> 43:02.648
You never know who's
carrying around hepatitis, right?

43:02.715 --> 43:05.617
Yeah. Listen,
I'm sorry to drop in on you like this,

43:05.684 --> 43:07.987
but they changed my itinerary last-minute.

43:08.053 --> 43:09.855
I just got off a plane an hour ago,

43:10.255 --> 43:13.125
- came straight here.
- I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

43:13.726 --> 43:14.994
It's a bad time?

43:15.661 --> 43:16.661
Yes.

43:17.529 --> 43:19.131
[both laughing]

43:19.198 --> 43:20.799
[Chris] Buy a shirt for the concert.

43:20.866 --> 43:22.768
- You look like shit.
- [Chester] I don't understand

43:22.835 --> 43:25.104
why we can't just go back
to your brother's place.

43:25.170 --> 43:27.506
'Cause Johnny's gonna murder me
when he sees me.

43:27.573 --> 43:30.275
Luckily I've had this shirt
in my trunk for the last two years.

43:30.542 --> 43:31.844
- [Chester] Mm.
- Ooh, ooh.

43:34.546 --> 43:35.546
Oh, try this.

43:39.184 --> 43:40.986
Thrift stores smell like giving up.

43:41.053 --> 43:43.188
I imagine this is
how the set of Girls smells.

43:43.255 --> 43:45.958
- Smells like Johnny Depp.
- These kids will wear a T-shirt

43:46.025 --> 43:48.927
about not doing drugs,
then do drugs while wearing that shirt.

43:48.994 --> 43:51.130
That shirt makes you look
like Jared Fogle.

43:51.563 --> 43:54.033
Thanks. I'm nowhere near
as good-looking as that guy.

43:54.099 --> 43:55.134
- Take that off.
- Yeah.

43:57.169 --> 44:00.005
[Carey] Listen, I'm gonna be here
for the next two weeks.

44:00.072 --> 44:02.775
Make sure things run smooth
at our new Silver Lake store.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.544
But I'm thinking maybe I can steal
some secrets from you,

44:05.611 --> 44:08.213
teach them how to run a good business.
What do you say?

44:08.280 --> 44:10.360
- Oh, by all means. Be my guest.
- [knocking on door]

44:10.582 --> 44:11.950
- Hey... Uh...
- That would be...

44:12.017 --> 44:14.853
- Oh. Come in.
- I didn't mean to interrupt.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.655
I have those tallies for you, Danny,

44:16.722 --> 44:20.292
- but I can come back later if you're...
- No, no, no. Brooke. Oh, no. Stay. Stay.

44:20.559 --> 44:22.995
I'm sure Carey wants
to see how we do business.

44:23.062 --> 44:24.163
You are damn right I do.

44:24.596 --> 44:25.798
By the way, uh,

44:25.864 --> 44:29.701
Brooke just broke up with her boyfriend,
so, now she's single, cha-ching.

44:32.738 --> 44:33.939
Lay it on us, Brooke.

44:34.773 --> 44:37.076
Registers One and Two are even.

44:38.043 --> 44:40.612
Register Three is 50 cents over.

44:40.779 --> 44:46.585
Register Four is
820 dollars and seven cents under.

44:46.652 --> 44:48.954
- Register Five is even.
- What was that?

44:49.788 --> 44:50.989
Register Five is even?

44:51.056 --> 44:52.056
No.

44:52.858 --> 44:53.992
Register Four.

44:54.059 --> 44:57.729
Chester's register is missing
820 dollars and seven cents.

44:58.831 --> 45:01.071
- I don't have a ride. Shit.
- [Chester] Cover my register!

45:01.133 --> 45:04.002
Hey, I'm so sorry.
Our card machine's actually not working.

45:07.840 --> 45:08.840
Eight hundred.

45:09.174 --> 45:10.976
I'll take those tallies.

45:11.043 --> 45:12.043
Thank you, Brooke.

45:14.746 --> 45:16.982
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you, dear.

45:18.884 --> 45:19.884
[Danny] Uh...

45:20.786 --> 45:22.721
You want a Kombucha or something?

45:22.788 --> 45:24.690
[Chester] This is Chester.
Leave me a message.

45:24.923 --> 45:28.126
When I said you owe me $5,000,
I didn't mean steal it

45:28.193 --> 45:31.897
from our store, you lazy fuck.
We're a high-end grocery store.

45:32.297 --> 45:35.234
I have cameras all over the place
to watch people like you.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.668
Oh, shit.

45:45.878 --> 45:46.878
Come on!

45:47.713 --> 45:48.713
Come on.

45:50.015 --> 45:51.283
Erase, erase, erase.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.653
Erase.
Where's the "erase" button on this thing?

45:59.691 --> 46:00.691
[sighs]

46:00.759 --> 46:01.960
Fucking cunt.

46:02.027 --> 46:04.997
[Greg] Danny. Pick up, pronto.
We need you at the front of the store.

46:05.063 --> 46:07.933
Just give them a refund.
I don't have time for some geriatric

46:08.000 --> 46:10.369
trying to return day-old bread.
Fucking losers!

46:10.435 --> 46:14.172
Man, uh... I should've probably told you.
You're on speakerphone.

46:14.239 --> 46:17.175
Also... these guys aren't old.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.011
Hey, who...? Who are you guys?

46:19.077 --> 46:20.012
We're cops.

46:20.078 --> 46:22.814
[Greg] Wait, hold on. I had my hand
on the button the whole time.

46:22.881 --> 46:24.917
Did you get that, Danny?
These guys are cops.

46:24.983 --> 46:27.019
[woman] What's your relationship
to Jay Morrison?

46:27.085 --> 46:28.526
[Danny] Speak up. It's loud in here.

46:28.687 --> 46:30.328
What's your relationship to Jay Morrison?

46:30.355 --> 46:31.690
I don't know who that is.

46:31.757 --> 46:34.293
You know, a lot of people come in
and out of here all day.

46:34.693 --> 46:38.397
If I started keeping track of him,
that would be considered racial profiling.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.198
We didn't say what race he was.

46:40.265 --> 46:42.301
Anybody can be racially profiled,
all right?

46:42.367 --> 46:44.803
I'm starting
to feel a little victimized myself.

46:44.870 --> 46:47.105
I might call Al Sharpton if this keeps up.

46:47.172 --> 46:50.175
- Million Man March your asses.
- So, you have no idea who this is?

46:50.242 --> 46:52.945
- I don't know who it is.
- We know Jay's your coke dealer.

46:53.011 --> 46:55.747
And I'm confident if we looked
at the surveillance drives

46:55.814 --> 46:57.849
we could verify he was here this morning.

46:57.916 --> 47:01.386
We don't care about you.
We need you to help turn Jay in.

47:03.155 --> 47:04.389
I don't think I can do that.

47:04.456 --> 47:06.425
All right. Would you rather we lock you up

47:06.491 --> 47:09.094
for possession of narcotics
with intent to distribute?

47:09.261 --> 47:12.097
Because I don't have a problem with that.

47:13.265 --> 47:14.733
- Do you?
- Oh, not at all.

47:14.866 --> 47:16.802
Also add on organized criminal gambling,

47:16.868 --> 47:19.938
and you're looking
at 5 to 10 years in prison.

47:20.005 --> 47:21.807
You have by 6:00 to decide.

47:21.873 --> 47:23.175
You either help us lock up Jay

47:23.241 --> 47:26.511
or two L.A.P.D. officers will pick you up
in a squad car.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.213
Better lawyer up.

47:28.847 --> 47:30.082
I always wanted to say that.

47:53.372 --> 47:54.773
[door opens, then closes]

47:57.442 --> 47:59.311
- Yo what's up?
- Hey.

47:59.378 --> 48:01.146
Where's the money for the tickets?

48:01.213 --> 48:03.882
- He didn't want 'em.
- He drove all the way here

48:03.949 --> 48:06.551
- and didn't want them?
- He said he had to work or something.

48:07.119 --> 48:09.921
I mean, I can't force him
to buy the tickets, babe.

48:10.288 --> 48:12.958
Okay, why you getting so defensive for?

48:13.025 --> 48:15.927
You really wanted me
to make sure that he paid for the tickets,

48:15.994 --> 48:18.530
and he didn't buy the tickets
because he didn't want them.

48:18.797 --> 48:21.333
Okay, damn. Just asked you a question.

48:22.234 --> 48:24.269
- You mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

48:24.336 --> 48:26.438
- You mad at me.
- I'm not mad at you, babe.

48:27.039 --> 48:28.940
Let me make it up to you. Come on.

48:29.941 --> 48:32.477
- Wanna get chair massages or something?
- Yeah.

48:32.544 --> 48:35.480
- Then get something to eat?
- Oh, my God. I'm so hungry.

48:36.148 --> 48:38.450
All right. Pick a place. My treat.

48:38.517 --> 48:40.352
- Okay.
- Yeah.

48:43.055 --> 48:44.156
What's this?

48:45.123 --> 48:46.123
What?

48:49.361 --> 48:50.829
These ain't my tickets.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.132
You playing stupid right now?

48:54.232 --> 48:55.232
Huh?

48:55.534 --> 48:57.569
These ain't my fucking tickets.

48:59.871 --> 49:01.540
Yeah, I'm gonna see you at the concert.

49:03.141 --> 49:04.943
Calm down, baby. It's gonna be fine.

49:05.010 --> 49:06.945
- Don't lose your temper.
- Get the fuck...

49:07.012 --> 49:09.548
Serious? You got his number
and let him steal my tickets?

49:09.614 --> 49:11.049
You're a fucking thot.

49:12.984 --> 49:15.353
[groans] Ow!

49:15.420 --> 49:17.556
- I'm tired of you disrespecting me.
- That hurt.

49:18.323 --> 49:19.624
[sighs] [groans]

49:20.292 --> 49:22.260
- Come here.
- [groans]

49:25.464 --> 49:27.966
Look, we've been together six years.

49:28.867 --> 49:31.369
I'm just trying to get you
to be honest with yourself.

49:31.436 --> 49:33.205
I'm honest with you every single day.

49:33.271 --> 49:36.074
- What are you talking about?
- No, not with me. With you.

49:37.309 --> 49:39.945
Why do you watch porn all the time
when I'm right here?

49:40.979 --> 49:43.048
Jay, what kind of porn are you watching?

49:43.115 --> 49:45.250
Why the fuck would you ask me
that question?

49:45.650 --> 49:48.153
- What kind of porn are you watching?
- You know what?

49:48.920 --> 49:51.289
I'm just gonna come out and say it. Um...

49:52.357 --> 49:55.293
Do you wanna fuck other girls,
or do you wanna sleep with men?

49:55.360 --> 49:57.629
Either one is okay, Jay.

49:57.896 --> 50:01.366
I just need to know,
so I can stop lying to myself.

50:01.433 --> 50:03.535
Please, just tell me.

50:06.071 --> 50:09.274
When I get back,
I want all your shit out of here.

50:14.412 --> 50:17.048
[door opens, then closes]

50:17.115 --> 50:18.650
Oh, hey, Brooke. Hey, Brooke.

50:21.253 --> 50:23.555
- Yep.
- Hey, Brooke. Would you do me a favor?

50:23.622 --> 50:25.123
Would you go down to my office

50:25.190 --> 50:27.526
and just ask Mr. Winters
if he knows where I am?

50:27.592 --> 50:30.629
- Do I tell him you're in here?
- Just ask if he knows where I am.

50:30.695 --> 50:33.698
- But you're in here.
- Just do it! I am sorry, okay?

50:33.965 --> 50:37.602
I'm sorry I yelled at you again.
Would you do me that favor, please?

50:38.937 --> 50:40.405
- Yeah.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

50:41.439 --> 50:43.275
Please, don't call me sweetheart.

50:43.341 --> 50:46.244
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm...
- What are you doing?

50:46.311 --> 50:48.580
I was just gonna...
You have a little... That's...

50:49.080 --> 50:50.515
Hey, thanks a lot.

50:50.582 --> 50:52.250
I appreciate. Do me that favor.

50:52.317 --> 50:53.385
You're the best.

51:03.395 --> 51:06.264
[inaudible dialogue]

51:09.167 --> 51:10.202
[cell phone ringing]

51:10.268 --> 51:11.403
[cell phone ringing]

51:12.470 --> 51:16.074
Danny, I know what you'll say. It's okay.
I'll get your money. Don't worry.

51:16.141 --> 51:20.212
Good, because the price just went up.
Now you owe me an additional $800.

51:20.278 --> 51:23.014
- What? Why 800?
- Your register was short this morning.

51:23.081 --> 51:26.251
You didn't think I was gonna find out,
you piece of shit?

51:26.318 --> 51:28.620
Fuck it, call the cops.
I don't give a shit anymore.

51:28.687 --> 51:30.755
- Fuck you.
- It's all you. Goodbye.

51:31.022 --> 51:32.022
Hello?!

51:33.225 --> 51:34.593
Son of a bitch!

51:37.128 --> 51:38.530
[Jay] "Maybe you wanna sleep with men."

51:38.597 --> 51:40.999
Maybe that's your thing."
Man, fuck these labels.

51:41.066 --> 51:43.134
No one puts me in a box,
I put you in a box.

51:48.607 --> 51:50.475
Doing good. Money and pussy.

51:50.542 --> 51:51.710
Come on, keep it together.

51:51.776 --> 51:54.312
Keep it together,
keep it together, keep it together.

51:55.614 --> 51:57.115
What the fuck?

51:57.182 --> 51:58.216
Are you serious?

51:59.718 --> 52:01.386
[cell phone ringing and buzzing]

52:01.453 --> 52:02.754
[Jay] I see you, motherfucker.

52:03.421 --> 52:05.590
[Chester] I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

52:05.657 --> 52:06.725
You know what? Fuck it.

52:06.791 --> 52:09.461
Gonna send me to voice-mail,
you silly sexy motherfucker?

52:09.527 --> 52:11.129
Okay. Here we go.

52:11.563 --> 52:13.298
It's showtime, motherfucker.

52:14.266 --> 52:16.568
- Oh, shit.
- It's Jay time, motherfucker.

52:17.769 --> 52:18.703
Oh! Fuck that!

52:18.770 --> 52:21.139
How you like them apples?
Good Will Hunting.

52:23.174 --> 52:24.695
- Brake, brake, brake!
- [Chris] Brake!

52:25.277 --> 52:27.312
[Chester and Chris screaming]

52:27.379 --> 52:30.181
- Get the fuck off! I know how to drive!
- Oh, my God!

52:30.248 --> 52:31.783
Jay in this bitch!
Jay in this bitch!

52:32.050 --> 52:33.818
Rest in peace, motherfuckers!

52:46.264 --> 52:49.067
What the fuck happened, man?
You cut off that Range Rover?

52:49.134 --> 52:51.202
No. No, you saw me driving.

52:51.736 --> 52:53.071
[panting]

52:53.805 --> 52:56.374
- Was it a black Range Rover?
- Yeah. Why?

52:57.809 --> 52:59.711
- What the fuck did you do?
- Nothing.

52:59.844 --> 53:03.081
Nothing, okay? I stole two tickets
and some moonrocks

53:03.148 --> 53:06.151
from some guy on Craigslist.
It's fine. He's trying to scare us.

53:06.217 --> 53:08.086
- I could've been killed.
- What about me?

53:08.153 --> 53:10.722
- I could've been killed, too.
- You'd be Suge, I'd be Pac.

53:10.789 --> 53:13.591
- You'd be Puff, I'd be Big.
- Why are you always the best rappers

53:13.658 --> 53:15.360
in these hypotheticals?

53:15.427 --> 53:17.862
No one forced you to come here.
You could've said no.

53:18.129 --> 53:20.665
I would've been in Brazil
right now probably

53:20.732 --> 53:23.501
- if I wasn't carrying your dead weight.
- All right.

53:23.568 --> 53:26.271
- Wanna know why I always work the double?
- I don't know.

53:26.338 --> 53:28.840
Because I'm making back the money
that you stole from me.

53:29.474 --> 53:32.544
That I stole from you?
What did I steal from you, huh?

53:32.610 --> 53:33.745
Organix?

53:33.812 --> 53:36.381
Remember?
You talked me into stealing it with you,

53:36.448 --> 53:40.251
and then you sold that shit for $5,000
and told me you sold it for 3,000.

53:40.318 --> 53:43.521
Whoever told you that's a liar,
knew your gullible ass believed 'em.

53:43.588 --> 53:46.725
I didn't believe it until now,
but you have a tell when you lie.

53:46.791 --> 53:49.794
You squint your fucking eyes
every time you're lying, man.

53:49.861 --> 53:52.664
- That's how I know you're lying.
- No, that's my go-to look.

53:53.765 --> 53:54.765
Where are you going?

53:58.870 --> 54:01.673
[Chester] We've been walking
for two hours. We haven't seen a car yet.

54:01.740 --> 54:03.241
Sure this is the right way?

54:03.308 --> 54:05.028
[Chris] How many times
will you ask me that?

54:05.143 --> 54:06.864
But why are we walking
in the same direction

54:06.911 --> 54:09.347
as the guy who tried to kill us
drove off in?

54:09.814 --> 54:14.619
Look, the concert's the safest place.
All right, 15,000 people, metal detectors.

54:14.686 --> 54:17.856
I got the tickets he was trying to sell.
All right? He can't get in.

54:17.922 --> 54:21.326
What if he's thinking that
that's the one place we'll for sure be?

54:21.926 --> 54:22.794
Right?

54:22.861 --> 54:25.897
I thought you were gonna hitchhike home.
Why are you following me, huh?

54:26.264 --> 54:28.666
There's a lot of desert here.
Fucking go another way.

54:32.437 --> 54:33.437
What is that?

54:33.772 --> 54:34.772
Seriously?

54:36.508 --> 54:38.676
I'm not gonna follow you this time, Chris.

54:39.644 --> 54:40.644
I'm done.

54:51.589 --> 54:52.589
Wait up.

54:57.495 --> 54:58.663
Chris, what are you doing?

55:01.266 --> 55:02.266
What are you...?

55:37.368 --> 55:38.970
Dude, Brazil is nothing like this.

55:40.238 --> 55:41.506
There are beaches everywhere.

55:42.273 --> 55:43.274
You're gonna love it.

55:43.341 --> 55:45.710
[Chris] Yeah, it sounds great, dude.
I can't wait to go.

55:46.978 --> 55:49.347
I don't think I can... I can't make it.

55:49.414 --> 55:50.482
I'm so thirsty.

55:50.548 --> 55:51.549
That's all right, man.

55:51.616 --> 55:52.616
Come on.

55:52.884 --> 55:54.886
- [pants]
- It's not far.

55:55.620 --> 55:57.589
Okay, okay.

55:57.655 --> 55:58.790
[motor roaring]

55:58.857 --> 56:00.592
Oh, yes, yes, yes...

56:01.359 --> 56:04.362
- [Chester] Oh. Okay. Come on. Hey.
- [Chris] Yo, yo, yo! Yo! Please!

56:04.462 --> 56:06.331
- [Chester] I can help.
- [Chris] I got it.

56:06.397 --> 56:07.799
Please! Please! Please!

56:13.338 --> 56:14.739
Hi. Hi.

56:15.340 --> 56:16.407
[woman] Look who it is.

56:16.474 --> 56:19.010
Aren't you the douche
who stole my ex-boyfriend's tickets?

56:24.048 --> 56:25.717
I feel sad.

56:26.551 --> 56:28.786
And I feel angry.

56:28.853 --> 56:29.853
Sure.

56:30.355 --> 56:32.056
- I feel happy.
- Yeah.

56:32.323 --> 56:34.726
And, like, I don't even know
what I'm doing here,

56:34.792 --> 56:37.562
[chuckles] but lucky Carmen
had those two tickets.

56:37.629 --> 56:40.765
She knows Jay's crazy.
He would never, ever give them to me.

56:40.832 --> 56:41.933
Love is crazy.

56:42.000 --> 56:42.934
- You know?
- I guess.

56:43.001 --> 56:45.904
I mean, I'm old-school.
You know, I wanna meet someone.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.305
I'm not into dating apps.

56:47.372 --> 56:50.808
If we're meant to be,
you know, only God knows.

56:51.476 --> 56:52.844
So, how do you know Sahara?

56:52.911 --> 56:56.514
Oh. We used to work together back at TIYF
in high school.

56:56.981 --> 57:00.418
Oh, TGIF? Um, Magic Johnson's place
on La Tijera, right?

57:00.852 --> 57:02.787
No. TIYF. The strip club.

57:02.854 --> 57:05.523
I'm gonna be honest,
and I'm sure it's the same for you.

57:05.590 --> 57:08.560
The physical side's easy for me.
I can get that whenever I want.

57:08.626 --> 57:10.728
But I wanna come here. You know?

57:10.995 --> 57:12.096
I wanna come here.

57:13.064 --> 57:14.899
And I wanna make you come there.

57:15.567 --> 57:17.068
I wanna make you come in the heart.

57:17.335 --> 57:19.571
Has that lame-ass line ever worked
on a girl?

57:20.438 --> 57:23.341
Just trying to be a nice guy.
What are you talking about?

57:23.408 --> 57:24.776
Do you still strip?

57:24.843 --> 57:25.910
No. [Scoffs]

57:25.977 --> 57:27.679
- Yeah.
- I'm a paralegalist now.

57:27.745 --> 57:29.681
- Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah.
- Please.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.351
[Sahara] Here we go.

57:35.019 --> 57:37.388
- We'll just park the car.
- We'll meet you in line.

57:37.455 --> 57:38.590
[Carmen] Okay. Save us a spot.

57:38.656 --> 57:40.217
[Chester] Here. Oh, no, here. I got it.

57:40.358 --> 57:41.358
Watch your head.

57:41.559 --> 57:42.694
- Thank you.
- Of course.

57:42.760 --> 57:44.721
- All right. Bye, guys.
- [Chester and Chris] Bye.

57:45.496 --> 57:46.931
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.

57:47.665 --> 57:49.534
- You know she's a stripper?
- Really?

57:50.001 --> 57:51.002
Topless or all-nude?

57:51.436 --> 57:53.738
- Uh... Full frontal, I think.
- Oh, great.

57:53.805 --> 57:54.839
- Yeah.
- Where does she work?

57:54.906 --> 57:55.773
Uh...

57:55.840 --> 57:58.810
- Titties in Your... Titties in Your Face?
- Vermont and Washington?

57:58.877 --> 58:00.979
- Yeah. You been?
- Yeah. It's a new location.

58:01.045 --> 58:03.481
[indistinct chattering]

58:03.548 --> 58:05.229
[Chester] So,
how do you know Sahara again?

58:05.750 --> 58:07.886
I met her this morning.
When I got the tickets.

58:08.653 --> 58:09.653
At the...?

58:11.522 --> 58:15.593
You hit on the drug dealer's girlfriend,
stole his tickets,

58:15.660 --> 58:17.161
- and his moonrocks?
- No.

58:17.829 --> 58:18.830
Okay, good.

58:18.897 --> 58:21.733
I stole the moonrocks and tickets,
and then I hit on her.

58:22.634 --> 58:25.169
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I sort of stole 800 bucks

58:25.436 --> 58:27.071
- from your register.
- What?

58:27.138 --> 58:29.407
How else could I get my car out
of the garage?

58:29.474 --> 58:32.911
- Don't worry, I'll make your money back.
- You're always saying "don't worry."

58:32.977 --> 58:35.580
I got moonrocks.
Uncut moonrocks. Want moonrocks?

58:35.647 --> 58:38.549
- [man] Designer. FDA-approved.
- You a cop? Just kidding. Want drugs?

58:38.616 --> 58:40.952
Actually, it's 175 for two.
You wanna do two?

58:41.019 --> 58:43.154
Hundred for a gram. Moonrocks. Moonrocks.

58:43.421 --> 58:44.421
We're at capacity.

58:44.822 --> 58:47.859
They'll refund your tickets at the window.
Go home.

58:48.526 --> 58:49.827
- It's over.
- [man 1] You kidding me?

58:49.894 --> 58:52.014
- I've been waiting for hours, man.
- [man 2] Come on!

58:52.063 --> 58:53.932
- You don't even know.
- [man 3] Hey, back up.

58:53.998 --> 58:56.167
- Back away from the gate.
- [Chester] What's going on?

58:56.434 --> 58:58.770
They're shutting it down.
Gotta find another way in.

58:59.804 --> 59:00.972
- [man 4] I need backup!
- [man 5] Come on.

59:01.039 --> 59:02.960
- [man 6] Let us in!
- [man 4] We're at capacity.

59:04.809 --> 59:06.077
- [Chester] What?
- Come on.

59:06.678 --> 59:08.846
[man 4] All tickets will be refunded
at the front desk.

59:08.913 --> 59:10.081
Let's go.

59:11.549 --> 59:14.585
[man 4] Back up. Back away, and stop...

59:14.652 --> 59:17.922
[Chester] I got something I wanna tell
you. It's super important. Stay there.

59:19.757 --> 59:20.757
[Chris] Yeah, what's up?

59:20.792 --> 59:22.961
[both groaning]

59:23.628 --> 59:24.996
- Ow.
- What the fuck?

59:25.063 --> 59:29.133
You stole $800 from my register
and didn't tell me?

59:30.034 --> 59:32.136
I did it for us, so we could come here.

59:32.203 --> 59:34.072
I'm the one who gets in trouble for it.

59:34.138 --> 59:36.908
You ever think of that?
What else haven't you told me, huh?

59:36.975 --> 59:39.077
- Come clean now.
- What do you want me to say?

59:39.143 --> 59:40.143
The truth.

59:41.012 --> 59:43.648
- For once. Come on.
- What do you want me to do?

59:43.715 --> 59:45.249
Recap every lie I've ever told

59:45.516 --> 59:46.884
- in our relationship?
- Please.

59:46.951 --> 59:48.987
Do you want me
to give a fucking Venn diagram

59:49.053 --> 59:51.823
of all the mini-truths
and half-truths and somewhat-truths?

59:51.889 --> 59:54.092
- Yeah.
- I don't know. I don't remember them all.

59:54.158 --> 59:55.927
All right, let's start with Brazil.

59:56.894 --> 59:58.229
- What about Brazil?
- Come on.

59:58.496 --> 59:59.564
- Stop.
- Tell me.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.866
- If you don't stop touching me...
- Fucking tell me.

01:00:01.933 --> 01:00:04.068
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Tell me about Brazil.

01:00:04.135 --> 01:00:05.169
What do you wanna know?

01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:06.671
Are you going or not?

01:00:06.738 --> 01:00:07.738
I was never going.

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.910
I was never going, Chester. I'm sorry.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.282
I just wanted to hear you say it.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.561
[crowd cheering]

01:00:34.265 --> 01:00:35.265
Can we just go?

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.569
Can we just go to the concert?

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:40.805
["100 Roses" playing]

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:44.641
Yeah, all right.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.309
Fuck it.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:49.947

# I heard they talking down
They talking down #

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:29.120
# No they ain't #

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:45.169
# Said you popping in your city
Man, I don't believe it #

01:01:45.336 --> 01:01:48.739
# But when I come and shut it down
I swear you gonna feel it #

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:49.873
# 100 roses #

01:01:50.308 --> 01:01:51.308
# For the dead #

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:53.311
# Heard they talking #

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:54.745
# Where they at? #

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.680
# I'm the coldest #

01:01:58.616 --> 01:02:00.751
# Mystery me, mystery me #

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:04.122
# Dreamed about this shit
And then I got it, mission complete #

01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:07.658
# Everybody wanna be the hottest
Tryna be me #

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:10.862
# Laughing when they think
They really balling I'm taking the lead #

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:12.330
[Chris] This is the best concert ever.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.899
I could just pitch a tent
and, like, set up camp here.

01:02:14.966 --> 01:02:15.966
Live off the land.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.802
This is my Burning Man.

01:02:17.869 --> 01:02:20.638
I mean, did you see yourself out there?
Everybody was like,

01:02:20.705 --> 01:02:23.007
"Who's that cool guy dancing the samba
to rap music,

01:02:23.074 --> 01:02:24.809
and, like, being really honest?"

01:02:24.876 --> 01:02:26.244
- Seriously?
- Yes.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.879
You should do more drugs.

01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:30.248
- Oh, my God. Give me more. Come on.
- No. Chill.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:33.050
- Not now. I gotta sell the rest.
- Come on. I want some.

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:35.386
- I'll give you more in a half-hour.
- I want it now.

01:02:35.653 --> 01:02:37.121
- I'll piss on you.
- I'll tickle you

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:39.023
- if you don't give it to me.
- Oh, shit.

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.925
How fucking dumb are you, coming here?

01:02:40.992 --> 01:02:42.293
I thought your ass was dead.

01:02:42.693 --> 01:02:44.962
Who's that? Who's that?

01:02:47.732 --> 01:02:49.400
You said you only had two tickets left.

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:52.904
- I assumed you told the truth.
- I'm a businessman. That's what I do.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.306
Makes sense to me.
Basic supply-and-demand economics.

01:02:55.373 --> 01:02:57.775
- Well, I trusted you.
- You stole my tickets.

01:02:57.842 --> 01:02:59.710
Yeah. But as far as you knew, you know,

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.913
you lied before you knew
I stole your tickets.

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:04.448
So, technically, you know, you lied first.

01:03:04.715 --> 01:03:05.715
You lied first.

01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:08.186
- Try to mindfuck me?
- Try to mindfuck him?

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:10.221
No one mindfucks me. I mindfuck you.

01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:14.025
I'll take your mind, stick my dick in it,
have my boys stick their dicks in it,

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:15.226
run a train on your mind.

01:03:15.293 --> 01:03:18.296
- You have dicks on your mind.
- He doesn't know what he's saying.

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:20.431
- He's fucking drunk.
- I'm not drunk. I'm high.

01:03:20.698 --> 01:03:23.134
- Shut up.
- From the moonrocks, but not high.

01:03:23.201 --> 01:03:24.869
I'm not drunk, I mean. [Laughs]

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:26.971
I am fucked up.

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:28.905
[Chester chuckling]

01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:31.842
You take my moonrocks?

01:03:33.878 --> 01:03:35.079
I take your moonrocks? Yes.

01:03:35.746 --> 01:03:36.814
Absolutely I did.

01:03:37.215 --> 01:03:39.383
- And it was great.
- Jesus.

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:43.354
- Why'd you give him the backpack?
- Shut the fuck up.

01:03:43.421 --> 01:03:44.722
Okay.

01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:45.923
[gasps] Oh.

01:03:47.758 --> 01:03:48.758
Where's the rest?

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.228
In the car.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:53.864
- No, it's not. We wrecked the car.
- Yes, it is. Yes, they're in the car.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:56.000
I swear. He doesn't know what he's saying.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:59.337
Now, why? Why you gotta do that, man?

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:00.271
Shut up, Chester.

01:04:00.338 --> 01:04:02.473
You are a beautiful,

01:04:03.074 --> 01:04:05.977
glorious, majestic Asian dolphin,

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.479
and this society,
that's your Sea World, man.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.248
I wanna set you free.

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:12.016
Come on, let's be friends.

01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:14.352
Get the fuck off me
with that gay shit, coz.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:17.488
Just, please, let us go
and I swear you'll never see us again.

01:04:17.755 --> 01:04:20.291
- Don't worry. He's not gonna shoot us.
- That's your word?

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:21.359
I know the statistics.

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:24.929
Only 2 percent of people who get stuck up
in robberies actually get shot.

01:04:25.496 --> 01:04:27.265
[gasping and screaming]

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:29.934
I don't get my stash
in the next 30 seconds,

01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:32.336
the next one is going
through your friend's shoulder.

01:04:32.403 --> 01:04:34.839
One last thing.
I just wanna know one last thing.

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:36.974
Does Medicare cover hip replacement?

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:39.010
- What?
- 'Cause when I'm 50 like you,

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:41.212
and I assume
that you can only do missionary,

01:04:41.312 --> 01:04:43.347
I'm an ass guy.
I wanna get behind that shit.

01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:45.783
But that's gonna require
a hip replacement,

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:46.884
or a nurse,

01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:48.919
gently rocking you back and forth,

01:04:49.387 --> 01:04:52.957
back and forth,
and I'm not into having a nurse watch me

01:04:53.024 --> 01:04:54.792
get my fuck on all the time.

01:04:54.859 --> 01:04:56.460
Hey, what the fuck you talking about?

01:04:56.527 --> 01:04:58.162
Your jokes don't even make sense.

01:04:58.229 --> 01:05:00.531
You don't get Medicare 'til you're 65,
coz.

01:05:00.798 --> 01:05:03.200
- He would know. [Laughing]
- His jokes are stupid.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.304
- His sense of humor is just mean.
- We're the same age. It is mean.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.306
- He's fucking mean.
- Ageist motherfucker.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.374
- We're both millennials.
- [gunshot, then screaming]

01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:12.476
# I should be dead
I should be dead #

01:05:12.543 --> 01:05:14.011
# I should be dead
I should be dead #

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:15.913
# I should be dead
I should be dead #

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.349
[Jay screams] Get the fuck off me!

01:05:19.550 --> 01:05:20.818
[Chris] Let's go!

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:23.421
- Where's your car?
- [women] Hi.

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:24.487
Come on.

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:27.090
[screaming]

01:06:03.561 --> 01:06:05.596
[Chris] Just come to work today.
It doesn't matter.

01:06:05.863 --> 01:06:07.164
Yo, Danny's not gonna do shit.

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:10.167
If he was, there'd be,
like, cops around your place right now.

01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:12.103
Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right.

01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:17.041
[Chris] Hey, I almost forgot.

01:06:17.508 --> 01:06:18.943
Hey. Here.

01:06:22.113 --> 01:06:24.982
Man, this is like...
It's like a thousand bucks.

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.051
I'm repaying an old debt.

01:06:28.052 --> 01:06:29.052
[chuckles]

01:06:29.387 --> 01:06:30.554
What about the new debt?

01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:32.323
Okay, baby steps.

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:33.424
Baby steps?

01:06:34.592 --> 01:06:36.592
- Wanna come up front?
- [Sahara] Yeah. Let me out.

01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:40.030
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

01:06:42.066 --> 01:06:43.234
- [Chester] Bye.
- [Sahara] Bye.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.300
[Chris] Love you.

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:46.469
Yo.

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:50.107
There's a Nas concert in San Diego
this weekend.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.177
Will you actually pay
for the tickets this time?

01:06:54.044 --> 01:06:55.513
How else am I gonna get 'em, nerd?

01:06:57.648 --> 01:06:59.950
- Bye.
- [Carmen] Don't forget to call me.

01:07:01.986 --> 01:07:04.922
[woman moaning]

01:07:04.989 --> 01:07:06.524
[woman] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:10.127
Do it, do it, do it. [Grunts]
Yeah.

01:07:13.998 --> 01:07:15.358
[man on radio] You can reject God,

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:17.968
but he will not reject you.

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.236
I said, he will not...

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:23.374
He won't leave you
on the side of a road...

01:07:26.544 --> 01:07:29.213
- He created every part of you.
- [grunts, then groans]

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.116
He knitted you together
in your mother's womb.

01:07:32.183 --> 01:07:35.186
Do you not think of yourself
more highly than you are?

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:36.320
Well, do you?

01:07:36.387 --> 01:07:39.156
I know the answer. I know the answer.

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:41.025
- God knows the answer.
- [cell phone ringing]

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:42.660
You ask and you do...

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:45.802
- Who's this?
- [Danny] The hell you been?

01:07:45.963 --> 01:07:48.132
- I been waiting all night.
- You got my money?

01:07:48.199 --> 01:07:50.334
Hey, bring four baggies for me, okay?

01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:53.671
Don't ever tell me to bring you something.
Right? You ask for it.

01:07:53.737 --> 01:07:55.606
I got it. But if you're not here in 20...

01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:00.411
[man on radio]
a greater grace, and therefore it says.

01:08:00.478 --> 01:08:03.280
God is opposed to the proud,

01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:05.616
but gives grace to the humble.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.038
You look like shit, man. You okay?

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:30.374
Fuck you. Where's my money?

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:41.151
- Don't have to count it. It's there.
- You ruined my count. Shut up.

01:08:41.218 --> 01:08:44.188
What, are you depressed or something?
Are you all right?

01:08:44.255 --> 01:08:45.756
You know,
every time we get together

01:08:46.023 --> 01:08:49.158
it's all strictly business.
I never get to hear how you're doing.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.496
You know, I don't hear about Jay.
You know? How are you doing?

01:08:55.332 --> 01:08:56.734
Sahara and I broke up.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:08:59.103
That's fucked up, man. Bring it in.

01:09:00.104 --> 01:09:01.505
Bring it in. Come on, brother.

01:09:02.106 --> 01:09:04.575
- That's fucking...
- [sobs] We broke up, man.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:06.710
Let it out, bro.

01:09:06.777 --> 01:09:08.078
[sobbing]

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.145
Um...

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.515
What does she know, all right?

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:15.051
She doesn't know what she's missing.
You're talented, you're thoughtful.

01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:18.154
And look, you're like a drug-dealing,
Asian Brad Pitt.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:20.591
I'm not the man I once was,

01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:23.426
and people won't let me be, man.
They won't let me be, man.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.095
I just wanna be. Just let me be.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:28.299
You can be. You can be with me.
I don't give a shit.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.301
You can be whatever you want around me.

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:34.371
What the fuck are you doing, bro?

01:09:34.438 --> 01:09:36.740
You just said I could be
whoever I wanna be.

01:09:36.807 --> 01:09:39.609
I just said that so you'd
stop making me feel uncomfortable.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.679
- I mean, you gay?
- Oh, man. No!

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.214
- You straight?
- Yeah.

01:09:45.716 --> 01:09:47.518
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes?

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:52.823
Sometimes I like men.
Sometimes I like women.

01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:55.426
Sometimes I feel like a woman
who likes women, coz.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:58.295
Just give me the fucking baggies,
get the fuck out of here.

01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:00.130
I'm fucking tired of these labels.

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:02.166
I'm just trying to be honest with you,
man.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:07.770
[siren wailing]

01:10:18.849 --> 01:10:22.319
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:24.121
- Don't do it.
- Oh, motherfucker.

01:10:24.188 --> 01:10:26.457
Don't pull... Don't do that.
No, no. Don't do it.

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:28.325
Hands up. Hands up. Drop the bag.

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:30.327
[sirens wailing]

01:10:30.394 --> 01:10:31.895
[officer] Freeze! Hands in the air!

01:10:34.498 --> 01:10:36.433
What took you guys so long?
What the hell?

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:39.837
The guy kissed me on the mouth.
You couldn't show up two seconds earlier?

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:43.540
- We all really enjoyed that, Danny.
- Just because I'm running a business here

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:46.477
you think I got some kind
of white-collar crime going on here.

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:47.745
It's fucking racist, man.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:50.581
- Good day, Mr. Bryant.
- [Danny] Good day to you.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:15.739
[Greg] Y'all see Mia Lee
from KCAL News outside?

01:11:15.806 --> 01:11:19.209
She was eyeing your boy mad hard.

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:22.846
Yo, it was like she was jerking me off
with her eyes.

01:11:22.913 --> 01:11:25.416
The craziest part about it? I came, nigga.

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:28.619
Okay. Back to work, everybody.
Break's up.

01:11:28.686 --> 01:11:31.488
Greg, your break was up five minutes ago.
Back on the floor.

01:11:31.555 --> 01:11:33.957
I thought we were cool.
I just took you to Jamba Juice.

01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:36.326
Got you one with wheatgrass.
What the fuck?

01:11:36.827 --> 01:11:37.827
[knocking on door]

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:39.229
Come on in.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:40.397
- Danny.
- What's up, girl?

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:45.269
[clears throat] So...
there's some people here to see you.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:47.805
It's 8:00 in the morning.

01:11:48.906 --> 01:11:50.841
I don't know, but they asked for you.

01:11:50.908 --> 01:11:53.877
They asked for me? Who did? Who is?
Who are they, asking for me?

01:11:53.944 --> 01:11:55.946
I guess I'm pretty popular these days.

01:11:56.246 --> 01:11:57.281
[chuckles]

01:11:58.549 --> 01:11:59.416
Hey, guys.

01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:00.684
Did you forget something?

01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:01.852
Kind of.

01:12:01.919 --> 01:12:04.288
- We have a situation here.
- Well, I'm sorry

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.890
I don't have any more bookies
to turn over to you.

01:12:06.957 --> 01:12:09.226
I'm clean as a virgin's pussy.

01:12:09.293 --> 01:12:10.928
That is wildly inappropriate.

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:12.863
We have a warrant for your arrest.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.532
There was $1,800
unaccounted for yesterday,

01:12:15.599 --> 01:12:17.534
and Mr. Winters claims that you stole it.

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:22.005
Know what? I'm glad you guys are here.

01:12:22.272 --> 01:12:23.540
Because one of my employees,

01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:25.876
Chester Tamborghini,
has a lot of explaining to do.

01:12:25.943 --> 01:12:28.545
He's the one who's responsible
for that missing money.

01:12:28.746 --> 01:12:30.881
He'll be here any minute.
Get those cuffs ready.

01:12:30.948 --> 01:12:34.384
Well, if that's the case,
how do you explain the security footage

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:37.020
of you taking money
from the registers yesterday morning?

01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:38.655
That's considered felony theft.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:41.792
I don't know
what footage you're referring to.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.995
Would you do me a favor?
Go down to my office,

01:12:45.262 --> 01:12:47.030
and ask Mr. Winters
if he knows where I am.

01:12:47.297 --> 01:12:49.399
Danny's hiding from you in the back room.

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:53.270
I don't have time for this shit.
You tell him if that money doesn't show up

01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:55.305
by tomorrow morning,
the police will. Okay?

01:12:55.773 --> 01:12:57.641
- Yep.
- Bitch!

01:13:06.617 --> 01:13:09.686
[woman] Mr. Winters didn't say
who specifically turned over the footage,

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:12.422
but needless to say,
it'll hold up in court.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.628
That girl's a criminal.

01:13:18.028 --> 01:13:20.764
She probably took that footage
to George Lucas

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:23.534
and had my face CGI'd onto Chester's body.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.468
Come on.

01:13:24.535 --> 01:13:26.970
Pound it out, bro. You're under arrest.

01:13:27.037 --> 01:13:29.907
I didn't take the money.
I didn't... I'm not... I swear to God.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.875
You have the right to remain silent.

01:13:31.942 --> 01:13:34.711
Anything you say can be used against you
in a court of law.

01:13:34.778 --> 01:13:37.548
You don't have to do this.
I got cash with your name on it.

01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:39.583
No one has to know, not even your partner.

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:42.686
Hey, Danny. Meet your new cell mate.

01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:44.855
Oh, fuck. Get the fuck out of here.

01:13:44.922 --> 01:13:47.624
I can't get in... I can't do this.
I'm not built for this.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.493
- I'll give the money back.
- Come on.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.496
- I'll give it back. Please.
- There you go. Make friends.

01:13:52.563 --> 01:13:53.563
Be nice.

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:55.699
What's good, Danny?

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.704
[Greg] Hey, Chris.
Is Chester coming in to work today?

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:04.608
You know, I worked the morning shift,
but I can't do a double tonight,

01:14:04.675 --> 01:14:05.909
because I got a date.

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:08.579
Got a date? With who?

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:10.747
Nope.
I'm not even falling for this one again.

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.015
No. I know how this goes.

01:14:12.082 --> 01:14:14.518
Remember what happened with my last girl?
Stacey?

01:14:14.585 --> 01:14:17.754
- The girl I met in church?
- Church is ringing a bell, yeah.

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:19.823
You fucked her.
I was gonna marry that chick

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:21.959
and you stole her from me,
you son of a bitch.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.994
I bought her tickets
to Harry Potter World.

01:14:24.061 --> 01:14:26.964
We were going all the way.
I was gonna get her a quidditch set,

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.099
buy her Butterbeer,
I was gonna get her a wand

01:14:29.366 --> 01:14:31.501
- from Ollivanders...
- Just shut up for a second.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.838
[Chester speaking in Portuguese]

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:39.943
English? Can you just speak English?
It's gonna be quicker that way.

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:42.446
Your Portuguese is kind of bad.
No offense.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:43.914
One ticket to Sao Paulo, please.

01:14:43.981 --> 01:14:44.981
- Brazil.
- Yes.

01:14:45.015 --> 01:14:46.450
Wow. You must be really excited.

01:14:47.117 --> 01:14:49.853
- I am. [Chuckles]
- Okay. When are you returning?

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:52.789
Not really sure, actually.

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:55.492
Okay, the only flight
I have available today

01:14:55.559 --> 01:14:57.527
is in coach, and it's $697.

01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:01.798
Wow, that's a lot of cash.

01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:05.769
It was a gift from a friend.

01:15:05.836 --> 01:15:07.037
[cell phone ringing]

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.075
Okay. Aisle seat okay?

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:14.144
- Sorry?
- Aisle seat?

01:15:17.014 --> 01:15:18.081
Aisle seat's great.

01:15:18.148 --> 01:15:20.183
Is that Chester?
Tell him I said "what's up?"

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:23.520
[Chester] Hey, it's Chester. I'm out
of the country. Service might be spotty,

01:15:23.587 --> 01:15:25.856
but I'll get back to you
when I get a chance, ciao.

01:15:28.926 --> 01:15:32.162
Gregory, you and I have the potential
to become very good friends,

01:15:32.429 --> 01:15:34.097
but I need to know something important.

01:15:34.598 --> 01:15:35.598
Yo, what's up, man?

01:15:35.732 --> 01:15:37.801
Do you have a car? Or plan on buying one?

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:40.570
Because in my experience,
carpooling is essential

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:42.572
in building a very real friendship.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:44.875
You know what's crazy?
I actually don't own a car.

01:15:44.942 --> 01:15:46.810
- I like riding my bike to work.
- Shit.

01:15:46.877 --> 01:15:48.879
It's better for the environment
and cheaper.

01:15:48.946 --> 01:15:50.814
- Right.
- Know what we could do, though?

01:15:50.881 --> 01:15:54.551
Tandem bikes. Tandem bikes, bro.
We can ride 'em around ironically,

01:15:54.618 --> 01:15:57.587
like those hipsters in Highland Park.
What do you say? Hey.

01:15:58.522 --> 01:16:01.058
You gonna leave me hanging like that?
For real, fam?

01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:04.728
I'm not putting my hand down
until you come back.

01:16:04.795 --> 01:16:07.064
Put your hands on your head! Now!

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:08.565
[man] What's the problem, officer?

01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:10.767
The car you're in
has been reported stolen.

01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:13.136
- Get out of the car nice and slow.
- Oh, shit.

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:16.573
[in Spanish]
I fucking hate Craigslist.

01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:19.609
# Shit on my chest
Shoot colors like a care bear #

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.979
# All year see me tan
Hopping out the van #

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:24.581
# You wasn't there
Now you tryna show face #

01:16:24.648 --> 01:16:26.216
# Fuck around, be a cold case #

01:16:26.483 --> 01:16:28.051
# Chrome skates on an old day #

01:16:28.118 --> 01:16:30.954
# Remote control chains
Promote dough for the veins #

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:33.056
# Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs #

01:16:33.123 --> 01:16:36.693
# Eat steaks off a cold plate
Stoned listening to Coldplay #

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.096
# Shit, you need to slow down, baby #

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:41.732
# My whole team
Cash and load out, baby #

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:44.067
# I'm a hero in my hometown, baby #

01:16:44.134 --> 01:16:46.670
# Stop talking, just go down, baby #

01:16:46.737 --> 01:16:49.139
# Long knife
By the spinal built like a rhino #

01:16:49.206 --> 01:16:51.575
# Push the 635 to the finals #

01:16:51.742 --> 01:16:53.810
# Pearl white like what you sniffin'
In your sinus #

01:16:53.877 --> 01:16:56.613
# The finest vaginas
Demolished by my dick #

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.815
# One year from Queens to the top #

01:16:58.882 --> 01:17:01.518
# Cream of the crop
Serve a fiend out my sock #

01:17:01.585 --> 01:17:03.587
# Five minutes
Till they lean like the drop #

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:06.414
# Now they spinning through the furnace
Like the scene from The Rock #

01:17:06.523 --> 01:17:08.692
# Hide spinach
Like a doomsday prepper #

01:17:08.959 --> 01:17:11.228
# Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather #

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:13.864
# Now my beard look
Like Uday and Qusay #

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.699
# Play the pool on a cool day #

01:17:15.766 --> 01:17:18.702
# Shit, you need to slow down, baby #

01:17:18.769 --> 01:17:21.104
# My whole team
Cash and load out, baby #

01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:23.673
# I'm a hero in my hometown, baby #

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.976
# Stop talking, just go down, baby #

01:17:26.043 --> 01:17:28.078
# A lot of people
With their hands out now #

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:30.947
# Got these motherfuckers mad
'Cause I'm a stand out now #

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:33.617
# You never let the hammer off
You got the soft hands #

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.919
# I hear you singing for the boss man #

01:17:35.986 --> 01:17:38.855
# I'm from a lost land
Spill coke on the heater #

01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:40.791
# Drop a little sauce on the beater #

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:43.293
# Zero to 60 in a Porsche
Like a cheetah #

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.929
# New York I'm like Jeter, light Caesar #

01:17:45.996 --> 01:17:48.298
# No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker #

01:17:48.565 --> 01:17:50.000
# You get drugs for a good price #

01:17:50.067 --> 01:17:51.935
# My price cheaper, guaranteed #

01:17:52.002 --> 01:17:53.837
# My trunk snapping like a tambourine #

01:17:53.904 --> 01:17:55.839
# Bodying these pussies
With a camera team #

01:17:55.906 --> 01:17:58.008
# Uh! You better slow down, baby #

01:17:58.308 --> 01:18:00.644
# Uh! You better slow down, baby #

01:18:01.278 --> 01:18:02.946
# You better slow down, baby #

01:18:03.213 --> 01:18:05.582
# I'm a hero in my hometown, baby #

01:18:05.649 --> 01:18:07.951
# Oh, man
Look who just fucking pulled up #

01:18:08.218 --> 01:18:10.220
# It's me #

01:19:26.696 --> 01:19:28.098
Oh, really, fam? It's like that?

01:19:28.165 --> 01:19:29.432
Really, nig? A'ight.

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:34.738
It's still up there.
I might have carpal tunnel from the time

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:37.040
- you didn't give me a high-five.
- What'd you say?

01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:40.310
Ooh. Big C-Dawg.
I knew you wouldn't leave me hanging, bro.

01:19:40.377 --> 01:19:43.180
Where'd we land with those
tandem bikes, huh? We rock it out?

01:19:44.305 --> 01:19:50.595
