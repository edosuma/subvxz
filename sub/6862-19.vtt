WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.570
The Rammer Jammer will turn into
some horrible chain restaurant.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.340
Unless we were
to pool the money.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.342
You mean together?
Lord have mercy.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.710
Some things that you
left at my place.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.512
This doesn't mean
that I forgive you.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.446
See you around.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.215
Are you okay?
The MRI was totally clear.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.649
LEMON:
 I saw you looking

00:15.683 --> 00:16.817
at Lavon and Ruby.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.486
I've been
keeping you from him.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.054
Go fight for your man.

00:20.088 --> 00:20.888
Before you make any decisions,

00:20.921 --> 00:23.357
I'm throwing my hat
in the ring, too.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.626
Yours is the only hat in the
ring, AnnaBeth. Ruby left.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.261
I told her I have feelings
for someone else.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.829
GEORGE:
 Part of me couldn't stand Jonah
 being with you.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.098
Because?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.665
Because he doesn't
appreciate you, Zoe.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.102
He's not going to see
how special you are.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.677
DASH: Mayor Hayes.
LAVON: Yeah?

00:43.711 --> 00:45.146
Now, this is the
second Sunday

00:45.179 --> 00:46.447
that the people
of this town

00:46.480 --> 00:48.316
had to line up
like Soviets

00:48.349 --> 00:49.617
for post-church
pastries.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.785
We need our eggs,
we need our bacon.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.653
We need our grits.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.822
Now, now, Lemon and Wade
are filling out

00:54.855 --> 00:56.290
the final paperwork
right now.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.292
The Rammer Jammer
will be open in a couple days.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.527
Wade Kinsella
and Lemon Breeland

00:59.560 --> 01:00.361
owning a business together?

01:00.394 --> 01:03.264
Better get used
to living on muffins.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.632
Wade and Lemon
are BlueBellians,

01:04.665 --> 01:06.434
and we will support them.

01:06.467 --> 01:09.437
But, you know,
maybe we should all

01:09.470 --> 01:11.472
practice cooking our
own breakfast, just in case.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.314
Man, we are
going to be huge.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.250
I cannot believe that this
is actually happening.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.251
And I agree: huge.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.186
And who cares that everybody
thinks we're going

01:25.219 --> 01:26.454
to crash and
burn, right?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.222
They do?
Uh, yeah.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.491
Oh, I guess people
are more forthcoming with you.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.859
But, for now, the
important thing is

01:31.892 --> 01:33.694
we give our customers
and staff the confidence

01:33.727 --> 01:35.729
that nothing is going to
change for the worse.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.398
Exactly.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.466
(sighs)
All right.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.567
Well...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.202
here we are.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.436
Uh, that's the wrong key.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.737
I assure you, it's not.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.339
Yeah, that one's brass;
the right one's silver.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.308
No worries-- I got mine.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.876
Just give me a chance
to fiddle with it.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.511
Well, why would I,
when I happen to know

01:50.544 --> 01:51.712
that this is the key
that opens the door?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.581
Because you take
the moment from me.
That's pretty cute.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.449
You know, if you
just let me...
No, just let me just get...

01:55.483 --> 01:56.617
(gasps)
ZOE:
 This is ridiculous.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.885
What do you mean,
you're not selling

01:57.918 --> 01:59.387
the Sunday
 New York Times anymore?

01:59.420 --> 02:00.721
That is the one thing
I actually enjoy

02:00.754 --> 02:02.223
buying at this store.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.757
(George clears throat)

02:03.791 --> 02:06.260
George, Frank is not selling
 the paper anymore.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.528
Our paper.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.763
Frank, we need the
 New York Times, all right?

02:09.797 --> 02:11.565
I-I wait all week
to read that thing.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.567
The-the magazine
and the Week in Review.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.469
Sunday nights, I need
to unwind with my

02:15.503 --> 02:17.371
crossword puzzle.
Crossword puzzle.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.706
Thank you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.674
As much as I am
devastated, inwardly,

02:20.708 --> 02:22.776
by the loss of your
puzzle, I can't do it.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.479
You two are the only
people in this town

02:25.513 --> 02:27.715
that even purchase that
liberal gossip rag,

02:27.748 --> 02:30.451
but the distributor makes
me order eight issues.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.221
I end up throwing out
six papers every week.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.555
Okay, Frank,
how about this?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.790
I will buy the other
six papers every week.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.958
And I'll-I'll
just give them away

02:37.991 --> 02:39.593
to the schools
or something.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.329
All right, you got a deal.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.896
You are my hero.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.599
(laughing)

02:46.900 --> 02:49.203
Enough of that.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.271
Just a couple of papers.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.305
Thank you.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.640
Bye.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.442
Yeah.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.283
So, we should make sure
to get to the Rammer Jammer

03:02.316 --> 03:04.552
day after tomorrow so that
we can show our support

03:04.585 --> 03:05.686
to Lemon and Wade.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.820
Yes.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.890
Right.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.692
You okay?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.227
Yes.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.596
(clears throat)
You sure?

03:15.629 --> 03:17.431
Yes.
Okay.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.567
'Cause you would tell me
if something was...

03:19.600 --> 03:21.269
What is going on with
you and Zoe Hart?

03:21.302 --> 03:22.836
What are you talking about?

03:22.870 --> 03:23.937
I bit my tongue

03:23.971 --> 03:26.374
when you did everything
in your power to stop Zoe

03:26.407 --> 03:27.941
from having sex
with Jonah Breeland

03:27.975 --> 03:30.411
during spring break,
but I just saw you

03:30.444 --> 03:32.413
promise to buy six
extra newspapers

03:32.446 --> 03:35.516
just so Dr. Hart could pretend
she's in New York City.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.817
Where she actually could be

03:36.850 --> 03:38.852
with a couple of clicks
on the Internet.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.321
I'll send her some links.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.989
Tansy, I would have
bought all eight papers

03:42.022 --> 03:43.824
to continue getting them
delivered for myself.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.726
This had nothing
to do with Zoe Hart.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.728
And, yes, I did not
want her to have sex

03:47.761 --> 03:48.762
with Jonah Breeland

03:48.796 --> 03:50.731
because she is my friend

03:50.764 --> 03:53.567
and he is a giant ass
with a stethoscope.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.868
But that's all.

03:54.902 --> 03:55.903
Baby, you're-you're my girl.

03:55.936 --> 03:56.937
Okay?

03:56.970 --> 03:59.407
I only have eyes for you.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.343
Good, 'cause I'm kind of
getting used to you.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.613
I'm kind of getting
used to you, too.

04:05.646 --> 04:09.383
Well, now, here they are.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.918
My two favorite
lovebirds.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.019
Guess what.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.921
I have the perfect parts
for you two

04:13.954 --> 04:15.689
in my big Shakespeare night.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.425
Shakespeare night?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.760
It's a review of Shakespeare's
most iconic scenes.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.630
A divine evening of laughter
and tears to raise money

04:22.663 --> 04:24.898
for the new school gym.
We would not miss it.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.635
Right. How could we miss
a Shakespeare night?

04:27.668 --> 04:30.404
Yay.
All righty, then.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.574
Hey, Big Z, I need some advice.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.442
Hit me.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.477
Well, AB signed
us up to do a scene

04:36.510 --> 04:37.545
in Dash's
Shakespeare thing.
Uh-huh.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.912
How do I get out of it?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.381
You want my advice?
Yeah.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.316
Suck it up and do it.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.785
For the school gym,
for AnnaBeth.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.954
I've been giving you
relationship advice forever.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.490
Now that I'm in need,
"suck it up and do it"

04:49.523 --> 04:50.824
is the best you can offer?

04:51.892 --> 04:53.661
Well, boo, Zoe Hart, boo.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.063
Oh, you want
better advice, ask Brick.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.931
It's shrink week,
and suddenly,

04:57.965 --> 04:59.800
he is our town Freud.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.402
You know, when your
father Harley started

05:01.435 --> 05:03.404
Mental Health Week,
I, too, was skeptical,

05:03.437 --> 05:05.706
but stress can impair
the immune system.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.375
And a week of
free counseling

05:07.408 --> 05:08.809
has proved very
beneficial

05:08.842 --> 05:10.511
for this town's
physical health.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.679
Oh, and, Lavon,
Hmm?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.481
it'd be great if
you would stop in

05:13.514 --> 05:15.483
and show your
support as mayor.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.684
Well... you're right.
Great.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.551
I'll-I'll come by tomorrow.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.853
Why do you get to do
all the counseling?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.922
I did a psych rotation
at Bellevue.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.123
Well, that's because
people don't want advice

05:23.156 --> 05:24.958
from a crazy person.
What, me?

05:24.992 --> 05:26.460
Lavon, stick up for me.

05:26.494 --> 05:27.828
Well...

05:27.861 --> 05:29.463
Lavon...

05:29.497 --> 05:31.865
As a matter of fact, you
should come see me tomorrow.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.034
I will reserve the 9:00 a.m.
spot especially for you.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.068
It just so happens

05:35.102 --> 05:36.970
that I have had
years of therapy

05:37.004 --> 05:40.007
with the best analysts
in New York City.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.610
I am the picture
of mental health.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.045
(laughing)

05:45.078 --> 05:46.480
You can stuff it.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.615
Both of you.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.517
(laughing)

05:52.820 --> 05:53.854
The staff meeting

05:53.887 --> 05:55.589
was supposed to start
15 minutes ago.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.090
Are people
usually this late?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.859
Well, I am.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.728
Hmm.
(door opens)

06:00.761 --> 06:01.762
Whoo.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.464
Hey.
Hey.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.432
I apologize
for my tardiness.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.568
I stopped to get a coffee
at the Butter Stick.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.836
It was a madhouse.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.738
Well, where is everyone?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.873
Oh, well,
to answer your question,

06:12.906 --> 06:16.477
in the restaurant industry,
there's a lot of turnover

06:16.510 --> 06:18.879
and changes
in management.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.148
And when the employees found out

06:21.181 --> 06:23.684
that you were
the new management,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.853
they, um, turned over.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.855
(chuckling)

06:27.888 --> 06:29.790
Come... come on.
All of them?

06:29.823 --> 06:30.924
Mm-hmm.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.626
Uh...

06:32.660 --> 06:35.863
Well, at least
you're here.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.064
Have a seat.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.866
Yeah...

06:38.899 --> 06:40.634
I just came by
to give you my notice.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.202
Tom's mother got us

06:42.235 --> 06:44.505
a bee colony as a wedding gift,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.607
and, well, honey's
really popular right now,

06:46.640 --> 06:48.542
so it's a great
business opportunity.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.644
So Tom's taking a job
at the Dixie Stop

06:50.678 --> 06:52.513
so I can be
a stay-at-home bee mom.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.814
It's so exciting.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.786
(clears throat)
I regret to inform you.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.654
I'm sorry.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.893
(door closes)

07:05.926 --> 07:07.861
So, we open in two days

07:07.895 --> 07:09.930
and we have no employees.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.065
Well, on the bright side,

07:12.099 --> 07:13.801
we have 48 hours
to find better,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.970
more enthusiastic ones.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.742
(knock on door)

07:26.079 --> 07:26.914
George?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.016
It's so late.
What are you doing here?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.753
Brought you the Times.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.021
What?
Yeah.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.255
The Times?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.924
Where did you get it?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.258
Drove to Birmingham.
Really?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.560
That's, like, six hours.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.994
Why on earth
would you do that?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.029
Zoe, don't you know?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.499
I would do anything for you.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.938
You are everything to me.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.773
You always have been.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.788
(gasps)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.590
Dr. Breeland, this is Dr. Hart.

08:09.623 --> 08:13.226
I'm going to need
that 9:00 a.m. slot after all.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.632
(seagulls calling)

08:32.645 --> 08:34.081
(sighs)

08:44.191 --> 08:46.026
Well, good morning,
Dr. Hart. How are we?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.294
(clears throat)

08:49.062 --> 08:51.699
Look, obviously,
I am not about to let you

08:51.732 --> 08:52.866
butt into my personal life.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.735
And yet, here you are.
Yes.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.704
But I will be speaking
in hypotheticals.
Okay.

08:56.737 --> 09:00.941
So, what brings you here
this morning?

09:00.974 --> 09:04.678
If I had this
incredible dream

09:04.712 --> 09:06.046
about a certain
gentleman

09:06.079 --> 09:08.148
that I used to
have feelings for

09:08.181 --> 09:09.883
but really, really
didn't think

09:09.917 --> 09:11.218
that I still did,

09:11.251 --> 09:14.722
even though there was this hug
and he smelled so...

09:14.755 --> 09:17.324
that doesn't definitely,
hypothetically mean

09:17.357 --> 09:19.292
that those feelings
have reemerged, right?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.293
No, it doesn't.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.362
Especially if you're talking
about George Tucker.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.931
No, I'm not.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.298
Why? What if I was?

09:25.332 --> 09:26.867
No, I know, it's bad.
Crazy.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.001
And so

09:28.035 --> 09:29.937
embarrassingly repetitive.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.740
Dr. Hart,
you have just come through

09:32.773 --> 09:34.975
a-a very painful breakup.

09:35.008 --> 09:35.976
A very painful breakup.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.713
And it's normal
for your subconscious to pursue

09:39.747 --> 09:41.782
the road not taken.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.851
And I would suggest
that's why

09:43.884 --> 09:45.819
George Tucker
is appearing in your dreams.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.821
Because he is unavailable,

09:47.855 --> 09:51.358
and thus,
unable to hurt you.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.661
See, he is the man
in your dreams,

09:53.694 --> 09:55.295
not the man of your dreams.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.865
Not bad, Dr. Breeland.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.370
So, George has moved on.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.738
You know, he's happy.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.107
So what if he's amazing
and wonderful

10:07.140 --> 10:09.977
and I probably made a mistake
not picking him way back when.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.044
I'm a rational person.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.112
I'm a doctor.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.214
I can control my own emotions.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.983
I won't let myself like him.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.985
I can just put
these feelings out.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.853
Just squash them.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.121
Way, way down.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.355
Push them.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.724
Deep, deep, deep

10:23.757 --> 10:26.694
into my sub, sub,

10:26.727 --> 10:28.295
(voice getting deeper):
sub, subconscious.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.063
Well, how about,
until you have

10:30.097 --> 10:33.200
some perspective on your
feelings, you just lay off?

10:33.233 --> 10:35.135
Avoid intimate situations
where you might...

10:35.168 --> 10:37.270
Hug?
Right,

10:37.304 --> 10:40.741
or do or say
something crazy.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.311
Great idea.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.913
Because, when it
comes to George,

10:45.946 --> 10:48.048
not smart--
kind of my M.O.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.350
So I am going to stay
in the office all day.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.753
All week-- all month
if I have to,

10:52.786 --> 10:55.355
just to avoid any chance
of running into him.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.991
Is there any chance you could
use some of that office time

10:58.025 --> 10:59.459
to-to deal
with our unpaid billing?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.029
If I'm being honest,
probably not.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.331
Oh, uh, Mayor Hayes,
you're early.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.866
That's great, because you

11:05.899 --> 11:08.235
can be Dr. Breeland's
first patient of the day.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.336
Very first.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.438
You okay?
You're acting weird.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.306
You're acting weird.
Because I'm great.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.075
You two have fun.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.313
LEMON:
 So, Ms. Curran,

11:20.347 --> 11:22.115
you're applying
to be the cook?
Mm-hmm.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.483
Do you have
any experience?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.252
Not if you mean professionally.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.721
But I watch
every food show on TV.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.489
I made all
of Paula Deen's recipes

11:29.522 --> 11:31.258
for my grandfather.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.460
I put them in the blender
since he has no teeth.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.896
But his taste buds
are still going strong.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.731
Well, I see.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.933
But if I'm gonna work here,
I have some demands.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.302
I can only accept this job
if this one

11:42.335 --> 11:44.204
can avoid hitting on me.
Too skinny.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.505
That'll be tough.
And you have to

11:45.538 --> 11:47.174
install a TV in the kitchen,

11:47.207 --> 11:49.342
preferably with
Oprah Winfrey Network.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.012
And I take every
religious holiday off

11:52.045 --> 11:53.180
in every religion.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.482
You have to let me--
it's the law.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.417
Well, thank you for your time.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.119
BRICK
 Are you sure?

11:59.152 --> 12:00.387
There's nothing you
want to talk about?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.488
Brick, I told you.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.256
I'm only here
to show my support.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.958
I just want to read

12:04.992 --> 12:06.794
my sports section
and pass the time.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.062
Oh, hey,
uh, thanks a lot

12:09.096 --> 12:11.398
for getting me out
of Shakespeare rehearsal today.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.399
Interesting.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.102
Now, why would you want
to avoid rehearsal?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.838
No reason.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.040
You know... Shakespeare--

12:20.073 --> 12:21.842
kind of a hack.
(chuckles)

12:21.875 --> 12:24.978
Lavon, talk to me.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.283
I'm sorry. Our time is up.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.224
Hey, how'd it go?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.358
You shrunk?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.527
Oh, I'm fine.
Buy you some coffee?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.862
Oh, I can't.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.163
I got to stay here.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.131
Lots of paperwork.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.533
GEORGE:
Tansy, baby, you got
to see a doctor.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.501
I'll see Dr. Breeland.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.270
GEORGE:
Dr. Breeland's only doing

12:50.303 --> 12:51.304
therapy this
week, okay?

12:51.338 --> 12:52.873
You're gonna have
to see Dr. Hart.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.308
Actually, coffee
sounds great.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.510
(coughing)

12:58.912 --> 13:00.280
Yes, it's true.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.015
Moi was the silver medalist

13:02.049 --> 13:04.417
in the Southern Alabama
Roadkill Cooking Contest.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.319
I pride myself
on making the inedible

13:06.353 --> 13:07.587
in-inedible.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.589
That is impressive.
I'm in.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.491
Veto, veto.
I have veto power.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.361
(French accent):
12 years at Chez Lucille
in Mobile,

13:14.394 --> 13:16.229
specialize in--
how do you say?--

13:16.263 --> 13:18.231
"crowd-pleasers"
like boeuf bourguignon,

13:18.265 --> 13:21.034
coq au vin, escargot.
I'm sorry, uh...

13:21.068 --> 13:23.971
(French accent):
How do you say, uh, veto?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.874
(chuckles)
Wow, all right. Yum.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.141
Veto.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.144
51 years of waitressing
experience? My goodness.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.312
Veto.
(gasps)

13:32.345 --> 13:33.580
I spent the last
two summers working

13:33.613 --> 13:34.581
in my Aunty Rae's diner.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.050
I don't have a résumé, but I do

13:37.084 --> 13:39.186
have a swimsuit shot.
Would you like to see it?

13:39.219 --> 13:41.354
Obviously, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Veto, veto, veto.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.423
I could be a great waitress.
Better than you were.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.325
Mags, you have to be
19 years old to serve alcohol.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.960
Well, you also said
I have to be 21

13:46.994 --> 13:49.629
to get into bars,
so you don't know everything.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.498
(gasps)

13:52.499 --> 13:54.201
Who's next?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.636
She was the last person.
Sh...

13:56.669 --> 13:58.605
So, we open tomorrow

13:58.638 --> 14:00.107
and we have
hired no one?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.441
It's your fault!

14:01.474 --> 14:03.911
We had several
reputable contestants!

14:03.944 --> 14:05.345
Of all the crazies

14:05.378 --> 14:07.347
who have walked through
that door today, Lemon Breeland,

14:07.380 --> 14:10.183
you are the craziest.
(shrieks)

14:17.390 --> 14:19.492
What's going on with you?
We... we've been here

14:19.526 --> 14:21.428
for an hour. Don't you
have to go back to work?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.230
Don't you have to go
to Shakespeare rehearsal?

14:23.263 --> 14:24.898
DASH:
Come on, Crickett.
You are the understudy

14:24.932 --> 14:26.299
for Juliet.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.969
It is only one line.
Why can't you learn it?

14:29.002 --> 14:31.471
'Cause people don't
talk like that. (sighs)

14:31.504 --> 14:33.373
"Wh-What's here? A cup,

14:33.406 --> 14:36.109
"closed in my
true love's hand?

14:36.143 --> 14:39.112
Poison, I see..."
Something, something.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.981
"Hath been his timeless end.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.583
O churl! Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop."

14:45.252 --> 14:46.954
Why, Dr. Zoe Hart,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.088
you know the line.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.256
My mother
made me go

14:49.289 --> 14:50.457
to theater camp one summer.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.524
I was being punished.

14:51.558 --> 14:55.262
Oh, my Lord.
I have found my Juliet.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.964
Who? Me?
She'd love to.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.665
As a wise woman
once told me,

14:58.698 --> 15:00.133
suck it up and do it.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.302
O churl.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.678
Hey. I'm sorry
about earlier.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.546
Yeah, me, too.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.548
Listen, Dash's Shakespeare show
is tomorrow,

15:15.582 --> 15:18.318
and if we can't host the
after-party, then we're just...

15:18.351 --> 15:19.319
sunk for sure.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.088
So...
MAN:
Bonjour.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.292
(quietly):
What? Have you lost your mind?

15:25.325 --> 15:26.726
Someone needs to cook.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.695
And Chef Tiberghien has
years of experience.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.064
He trained at
Le Cordon Bleu.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.433
Listen, I am sorry

15:33.466 --> 15:35.502
that I went behind your back,
but it is clear

15:35.535 --> 15:37.704
that one of us just needs
to step up and lead.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.072
I agree.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.707
Which is why

15:40.740 --> 15:42.309
I hired Fanny

15:42.342 --> 15:43.476
to be our waitress.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.183
FRANK (monotonously):
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears;

15:50.217 --> 15:53.220
I come to bury Caesar,
not to praise him.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.456
The evil men do
lives after them...

15:56.489 --> 15:58.458
Frank, Frank,
that's fine,

15:58.491 --> 16:00.760
but could you do it with
a little bit more enthusiasm?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.063
Uh, I don't do enthusiasm.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.033
W-Well, pretend that
you're killing a small animal.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.600
It was one mouse!

16:07.634 --> 16:10.303
Mice carry Lyme disease.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.372
Uh, take-take five, Frank.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.044
All right, next up,
 Romeo and Juliet.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.078
(sighs)

16:20.580 --> 16:22.249
(gasps)
You're Romeo?
You're Juliet?

16:22.282 --> 16:24.217
Huh? Why?
I-I was gonna do
the scene with Tansy,

16:24.251 --> 16:25.285
but she got laryngitis.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.454
DASH: Well, I hope you're
not sick, George Tucker,

16:27.487 --> 16:31.191
because you two have a big old
smooch coming your way.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.426
Um...

16:33.460 --> 16:34.794
Oh, no.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.363
It's the
doctor's office.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.597
It's a medical emergency.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.332
I got to run.
But you...

16:46.639 --> 16:48.108
In a twist of bad luck,

16:48.141 --> 16:49.642
I somehow
am playing Juliet

16:49.676 --> 16:51.711
to George Tucker's Romeo.
Zoe Hart,

16:51.744 --> 16:53.780
you cannot kiss George Tucker.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.548
I know!
I am lonely and hurting.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.284
If I kiss him, I'm gonna go

16:57.317 --> 16:58.685
right back down
that rabbit hole again.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.388
So how do I
get out of it?

17:01.421 --> 17:02.522
Lie.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.790
Right.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.126
You are good at this.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.460
WOMAN:
 Ooh,

17:07.493 --> 17:09.462
the Rammer Jammer
is open again.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.298
I am just so happy.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.232
Hear, hear.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.135
(chuckling):
Ooh. Eggs!
Thank you. Bacon.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.170
Grits!
Grits!
Enjoy.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.373
(Lemon whoops, chuckles)

17:20.406 --> 17:22.675
You must be so cold
exposing all that flesh.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.810
You know, they say
70% of the body's heat

17:24.844 --> 17:26.679
escapes through
the... breast.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.249
Hi, guys. Glad you
could make it.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.318
We wouldn't miss
the grand reopening.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.186
This is very
exciting. It...

17:33.220 --> 17:35.622
looks amazing.
It looks just like the...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.590
the Rammer Jammer.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.560
Congratulations.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.296
Yeah. Congratulations.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.697
Of course we're here.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.734
Thanks. I'm glad you are.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.307
Hey, guys. How is everything?

17:54.341 --> 17:55.575
The eggs are fluffy.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.144
And the bacon's sublime.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.145
(quietly):
But these grits...

17:58.178 --> 17:59.579
Revolting.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.282
Uh, look, I'll take care
of this, all right?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.651
Breakfast is on the house.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.555
Hey there, Romeo.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.622
Hey.
How's Tansy?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.224
Uh, she's doing much better.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.226
Poor thing still doesn't
have a voice, though.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.495
Oh, yeah, you know, that
can take a couple of days.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.565
But listen, I-I just...
I wanted to talk to you.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.432
I actually had something

18:19.466 --> 18:21.334
I wanted to talk
to you about as well.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.336
Oh.
Um, no offense, but...

18:23.370 --> 18:26.339
Tansy is a little bit sensitive
when it comes to you,

18:26.373 --> 18:28.641
and I don't want to make her
jealous, so I don't think

18:28.675 --> 18:31.278
that doing this scene together
is a good idea.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.880
Oh. You are right.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.548
'Cause I really
wouldn't

18:35.582 --> 18:36.916
want to upset Tansy.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.385
Oh. Well, great.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.320
Well, thank you
for being so understanding.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.654
And now we just
have to...

18:41.688 --> 18:44.691
think of a plan
to present to Dash.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.728
LAVON: Okay, so,
about this Shakespeare show...

18:48.761 --> 18:51.898
Oh, I wanted to thank you again
for doing it with me.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.733
Jake's idea of theater
was watching

18:53.766 --> 18:55.635
the cars go through
the big spinny brushes

18:55.668 --> 18:56.636
at the car wash.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.338
Honestly,

18:58.371 --> 18:59.806
it's like a dream come true.
Oh.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.242
It-it is some kind of dream.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.376
(chuckles)

19:03.410 --> 19:06.913
Those hash browns
look amazing.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.815
But what are those?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.787
Those are supposed
to be grits?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.224
I'm disgusted.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.259
And I eat roadkill
on the reg.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.433
(quietly):
Lemon, people are
leaving, all right?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.435
Ratatouille back there
can't cook grits.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.903
You know how.
You got to show him.
What?

19:32.439 --> 19:35.442
Hey, uh, everybody, hang
tight a second, all right?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.277
Lemon is gonna show
our brand-new chef

19:37.310 --> 19:38.445
how to cook grits.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.480
All right?
(cheers and applause)

19:45.452 --> 19:48.355
I have mastered the classics of
French cuisine from "A" to zed,

19:48.388 --> 19:50.457
but I have been vanquished
by grits?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.925
Now you teach me?

19:52.959 --> 19:55.828
The shame.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.830
LAVON:
 I made a mistake

19:57.864 --> 19:59.866
promising AnnaBeth I'd do
the Shakespeare night.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.000
I mean,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.536
I'm a football
player-slash-mayor.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.971
I'm not a
football player-

20:05.004 --> 20:06.739
slash-mayor-slash-actor.

20:06.773 --> 20:07.840
I can't humiliate myself

20:07.874 --> 20:09.842
in front of this town,
in front of her.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.777
Lavon, I've seen you

20:10.810 --> 20:13.546
make eloquent speeches,
debate with gusto.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.316
What makes you think you're
gonna humiliate yourself?

20:16.349 --> 20:19.852
Do you recall a certain middle
school production of The Wiz?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.354
(laughing):
Oh.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.556
The one... the one
with the stuttering Scarecrow?

20:23.590 --> 20:24.891
(laughing)

20:25.892 --> 20:27.994
Oh. Oh, my Lord.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.829
You were
the stuttering Scarecrow?

20:29.862 --> 20:32.499
Every time I even think
about being onstage,

20:32.532 --> 20:34.601
it-it all comes back to me.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.935
Lavon, that was a long time ago.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.470
You have matured.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.472
Th-There's no reason
to avoid this.
(knocking)

20:39.506 --> 20:41.908
Hey there!
Oh, Shelby, honey, uh,

20:41.941 --> 20:43.910
can't you see I have a patient?

20:43.943 --> 20:45.878
Oh, sorry.
Can't see who it is.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.415
Hey, Lavon.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.684
Well, now that I'm here...

20:51.718 --> 20:55.622
I wanted to see if you might
want to get... lunch later.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.690
I've barely seen you
all week.
I-I know.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.760
I-I'm sorry,
but the-the mayor needs me.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.763
(quietly):
He is having a crisis
of confidence.

21:03.796 --> 21:04.831
He's...

21:04.864 --> 21:06.032
falling apart.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.667
Hello. I'm right here.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.539
Of course.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.576
I'll be praying for you.
(chuckles)

21:21.113 --> 21:23.450
Who is avoiding what here?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.418
Hey. Who is
the doctor here?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.786
Now, I have

21:26.819 --> 21:29.088
oodles of community theater
experience.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.858
I was the Modern Major-General,
so I will clear the books,

21:31.891 --> 21:35.528
and I will spend the rest
of the day... coaching you.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.796
I... don't know.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.531
Uh, don't you have patients?

21:38.565 --> 21:40.533
Nothing is more important

21:40.567 --> 21:41.868
than helping
the town's mayor.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.803
(loudly):
First...

21:43.836 --> 21:45.071
we improv.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.574
DASH:
 No, no, no.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.476
But I can tutor
Crickett myself.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.877
She is terrible.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.011
Besides, the scandal

21:52.044 --> 21:54.614
of George Tucker
and Zoe Hart performing

21:54.647 --> 21:56.483
Romeo and Juliet

21:56.516 --> 21:58.518
will be a huge box office draw.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.752
Okay, well, Dash, listen,

21:59.786 --> 22:01.688
we know that you want
to fill seats.

22:01.721 --> 22:02.755
So I had an idea--

22:02.789 --> 22:06.092
how about Tom and Wanda
as Romeo and Juliet, huh?

22:06.125 --> 22:07.694
The newlyweds.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.828
I mean, they're
fan favorites.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.897
There won't be
a dry eye in the house.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.999
Now, do you all take me
for an amateur

22:13.032 --> 22:14.834
amateur theater director?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.970
Tom and Wanda was
obviously my first choice,

22:18.004 --> 22:21.508
but they claimed to be consumed
by their new business endeavors.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.710
You leave it to us!

22:23.743 --> 22:25.044
Yeah!
Go!

22:25.077 --> 22:26.846
Yeah.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.717
Two angels on horseback,
BLT-- burn one--

22:30.750 --> 22:33.486
and a large cow feed.
Okay, enough with
the diner lingo.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.588
You know that I don't
understand you.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.356
(frustrated sigh)

22:40.026 --> 22:42.929
Hey, okay, from now on,
everybody gets

22:42.962 --> 22:44.597
the special until
we slow down.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.534
(forced chuckling)
Well, she's joking.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.668
(clears throat)
Uh, we are still

22:48.701 --> 22:49.869
cooking to order.

22:49.902 --> 22:50.870
Wade,

22:50.903 --> 22:53.473
please, I can't do this
anymore, all right?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.007
I'm exhausted.
I'm not a chef.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.009
Well, at least no one's
storming out, Lemon,

22:57.043 --> 22:58.511
so that's a plus.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.046
So you have to.
Besides, we don't have

23:00.079 --> 23:02.048
a chef, Lemon--
thanks to you.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.517
Yeah, well, at least my hire
had other qualifications

23:04.551 --> 23:06.185
than "looks good
in hot pants."

23:06.218 --> 23:08.488
Fanny happens to be
a waitressing savant.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.022
You have got
to be kidding me.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.492
You said I couldn't serve here
unless I was 19.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.627
Well, that Fanny is a junior
at Fillmore High.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.195
Oh, no.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.766
Oh, no.
No, no, Fanny...

23:19.799 --> 23:22.034
I'm sorry I lied.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.570
A minor serving alcohol?

23:23.603 --> 23:24.904
Bill, we didn't know!

23:24.937 --> 23:26.806
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I have no choice.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.809
It is my legal obligation
to call this in.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.978
And they're gonna be taking
your liquor license.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.648
(exhales)

23:35.682 --> 23:36.783
(buzzing)

23:36.816 --> 23:38.918
And that's Bertha, Claudia,

23:38.951 --> 23:40.987
Dolores, uh... Esther,

23:41.020 --> 23:42.855
Fae and, uh, Georgina.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.991
We named her after
you, George Tucker.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.859
Aw. Thanks, guys.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.995
They are very cute.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.798
And I cannot believe that they
all have names. (chuckles)

23:51.831 --> 23:53.966
Okay, so now about
the Shakespeare show.
Oh, we'd
love to fill in.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.835
Great!
But we can't.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.870
TOM: I have to work at
the Dixie Stop tonight,

23:57.904 --> 24:01.107
and Wanda's got her hands full
taking care of our babies.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.976
I have an idea.

24:05.011 --> 24:07.814
They need to be given
their sugar water

24:07.847 --> 24:09.616
every hour on the hour.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.684
And look out for
Miss Maisie Margaret--

24:11.718 --> 24:12.885
she's wily!

24:12.919 --> 24:14.086
Oh, and don't forget

24:14.120 --> 24:16.055
to tape your socks
to your suit.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.124
The bees will
get in anywhere.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.026
And I mean

24:20.059 --> 24:22.895
(whispers):
an-y-where.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.564
George, you ready?

24:24.597 --> 24:27.133
I'll teach you how
to work the cash register.
Oh, yeah.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.668
Yeah. Just give
me one second.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.136
All right. Okay.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.638
Hey, Zoe.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.773
Hey, uh, thanks
for doing this.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.775
It's really touching
to see how driven

24:35.808 --> 24:37.076
you are to help
me and Tansy.

24:37.109 --> 24:40.179
Oh, you, my friend,
are welcome. (chuckles)

24:40.212 --> 24:41.948
Okay, well...

24:41.981 --> 24:43.482
have fun.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.924
*

24:57.664 --> 24:59.231
Okay, bees...

24:59.265 --> 25:01.000
here's your lunch.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.035
Yum!

25:03.069 --> 25:06.072
Mmm, yummy yum yum!

25:07.907 --> 25:09.208
Okay...

25:09.241 --> 25:11.644
who's in my pants?

25:11.678 --> 25:12.912
(grunts)

25:13.880 --> 25:15.114
Okay, come on, get out!

25:15.147 --> 25:16.916
Get out! Out! Out!

25:16.949 --> 25:19.051
Get out!

25:19.085 --> 25:20.286
(yells)

25:20.319 --> 25:21.654
(screaming)

25:22.922 --> 25:25.625
(loud buzzing)

25:27.059 --> 25:30.730
Us working together
was obviously a mistake.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.099
Genius revelation,
Lemon.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.834
We are a bar.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.936
We cannot survive
without alcohol.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.304
And another one.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.039
You are really
on a roll.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.774
What are we gonna do?

25:41.808 --> 25:44.677
Nothing.
What can we do?

25:44.711 --> 25:46.913
Now, now.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.781
Wally, what are
you doing here?
Are you a ghost?

25:48.815 --> 25:50.082
Is this some kind
of Obi-Wan thing?

25:50.116 --> 25:52.151
No, I was just down there
in the basement

25:52.184 --> 25:54.621
getting my popcorn maker
when I overheard you two.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.289
We lost our staff.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.660
And our liquor license.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.929
Well, can't say that's
not disappointing news.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.732
We ruined your legacy, Wally.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.700
I'm so sorry.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.737
(laughing)

26:10.770 --> 26:12.939
Welcome to being
a business owner.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.174
It's hard.
It'll suck

26:15.207 --> 26:16.943
the marrow from your bones.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.210
It's all you're gonna

26:18.244 --> 26:19.746
think about
morning and night

26:19.779 --> 26:22.248
to the detriment
of your family and your friends.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.817
But every once in a while,
you're gonna look around,

26:24.851 --> 26:28.287
you're gonna realize
this is your place...

26:28.320 --> 26:30.589
your place...

26:32.124 --> 26:35.995
...and sometimes that's
gonna make it all worth it.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.131
(laughing)

26:39.165 --> 26:41.167
But whatever.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.003
(Wally chuckling)

26:47.940 --> 26:49.308
Alcohol and
Beverage Control

26:49.341 --> 26:51.177
doesn't close
for the next half hour.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.713
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.181
Come on.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.650
BRICK:
Come on, now, Lavon,
we have improv'd,

26:57.684 --> 27:00.419
we have discussed various
theories and motivations.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.387
Curtain's in an hour.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.356
It is time to try the scene,
at least once.

27:04.390 --> 27:07.994
I think we should do more
of those mime-y exercises first.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.796
I can get out of the box.
No...

27:09.829 --> 27:11.698
(ringtone playing)

27:11.731 --> 27:15.434
I'm-I'm sorry.
I should've shut this thing off.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.803
Shelby again?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.204
(ringtone stops)

27:19.305 --> 27:22.008
Brick... what's going on
with you two?

27:22.041 --> 27:24.143
It-it's complicated, you know.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.746
There's just something
I have to tell her,

27:26.779 --> 27:28.981
and, uh, I don't know
how she's gonna take it.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.951
But... we are here

27:31.984 --> 27:33.419
to work
on your issues,

27:33.452 --> 27:35.955
so... so let's hear
the speech.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.361
No, no, Brick, I can't. Uh-uh.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.063
Yes, you can! Lavon!

27:44.096 --> 27:46.999
Come on, on your feet.
What we are gonna do is,

27:47.033 --> 27:48.234
we are gonna visualize.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.136
Okay? You...

27:50.169 --> 27:52.371
are not that stuttering
Scarecrow anymore.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.040
You are...

27:54.073 --> 27:55.942
Sir Ian McKellen.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.912
You are Denzel Washington.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.048
(chuckles)

28:02.081 --> 28:04.784
That's right.
So, close your eyes now,

28:04.817 --> 28:06.285
and imagine with me--
the theater

28:06.318 --> 28:07.419
is filled.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.488
The lights
are going down.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.058
You step on the stage.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.460
The audience
is waiting, watching.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.062
They're breathless.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.463
The curtain...

28:17.496 --> 28:19.131
goes up...

28:19.165 --> 28:21.067
and...

28:22.835 --> 28:24.203
Hey!

28:24.236 --> 28:25.838
Oh, come on, now.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.940
Wanda?
Mm-hmm?

28:27.974 --> 28:31.210
I am so, so sorry,
but I couldn't feed your bees.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.344
What?
I'm-I'm so sorry.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.780
Th-They'll be
so hungry.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.081
Uh, you know what?

28:35.114 --> 28:37.817
You go, and I will
do the scene with Tom.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.086
Don't worry,
we will make you proud.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.856
Oh. You're gonna
kiss my husband.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.926
Just know, if there's any
tongue, I'll remove yours.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.227
Noted. Hmm.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.998
And... 32 cents is your change.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.532
Seriously, George,

28:53.565 --> 28:55.434
could you fall
any further?

28:55.467 --> 28:58.204
Boy, I dodged a bullet
with you, huh?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.807
Good to see you, too, Daisy.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.775
(low chuckle)

29:02.809 --> 29:04.811
(sighs) Oh. Hey, babe.
What are you doing here?

29:04.844 --> 29:05.812
How-how's your throat?

29:05.845 --> 29:06.879
No?

29:06.913 --> 29:09.816
"Why are you here?
What happened

29:09.849 --> 29:10.983
to R & J?"

29:11.017 --> 29:12.885
Oh. As it turned out,

29:12.919 --> 29:14.854
Dash had asked Zoe to
fill in for Juliet,

29:14.887 --> 29:16.222
and I obviously
didn't think

29:16.255 --> 29:18.257
it was a good idea
for me to kiss her.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.692
(sighs)

29:24.563 --> 29:27.166
"Why the 'H' not?" Uh...

29:27.199 --> 29:29.168
because I knew
how uncomfortable

29:29.201 --> 29:30.469
it'd make you... babe.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.912
Um...

29:43.349 --> 29:45.184
(panting)

29:45.217 --> 29:47.453
So... when he comes out,

29:47.486 --> 29:49.188
I'll do the talking.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.590
What? No, I'll
do the talking.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.160
Besides, it could be
a woman, sexist.
Good point.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.527
Those abs
you must spend, what,

29:55.561 --> 29:56.996
40 hours a week
cultivating

29:57.029 --> 29:58.330
might actually
prove useful.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.166
Didn't know you'd ever
noticed them, Lemon.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.433
Well, how could
I not, Wade?

30:01.467 --> 30:04.570
You parade those things around
town like they're dancing bears.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.238
Actually...

30:06.272 --> 30:07.539
You... stop it!

30:07.573 --> 30:10.076
Get your hands off!
I am not a piece of meat.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.912
(door opens, closes)

30:12.945 --> 30:14.580
(footsteps approaching)

30:14.613 --> 30:16.082
(gasps)
Oh, my...

30:21.220 --> 30:22.521
(whispering inaudibly)

30:22.554 --> 30:23.956
What are we doing?

30:23.990 --> 30:26.192
This doesn't make
any sense at all.

30:26.225 --> 30:28.360
(indistinct whispering)

30:28.394 --> 30:31.497
Well, well, well,
who do we have here?

30:31.530 --> 30:33.132
(laughs)

30:33.165 --> 30:35.434
Friends, Romans, countrymen,

30:35.467 --> 30:37.103
lend me your ears;

30:37.136 --> 30:39.205
I come to bury Caesar,

30:39.238 --> 30:41.107
not to praise him.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.608
SHELBY (quietly):
Lips, the teeth,
the tip of the tongue,

30:42.641 --> 30:44.643
the lips, the teeth, the tip of
the tongue, the lips, the teeth,

30:44.676 --> 30:46.645
the tip of the tongue,
the lips, the teeth...

30:46.678 --> 30:48.080
Brick.
Hey there, honey pie.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.016
I just want to wish you
good luck tonight.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.418
Flowers? Really?

30:53.920 --> 30:56.022
The noble Brutus
hath told you Caesar...

30:56.055 --> 30:58.891
(whispering):
You have been blowing
me off all week.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.559
I've barely seen you
since the hospital,

31:00.592 --> 31:02.228
and we live together.
I know,

31:02.261 --> 31:04.230
and-and I'm sorry,
but it's the therapy--

31:04.263 --> 31:05.664
it's a big time commitment.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.033
You know, preparing,
then counseling.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.201
But I promise you,
just a few more days

31:09.235 --> 31:11.170
and then I am totally yours.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.472
Yeah, well, I have
to get ready.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.241
An actor prepares.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.277
(Frank continues in distance)

31:19.378 --> 31:21.647
Wait a minute.
You're Juliet now?

31:21.680 --> 31:24.116
(audience applauds)
Nobody tells me
anything.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.918
All right, go...
go find Romeo

31:25.952 --> 31:27.954
and run your lines.

31:30.089 --> 31:33.325
(whispering):
Tom, I'm doing the scene
with you now. I'm sorry.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.161
What? No.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.495
Tansy.
It's... it's okay.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.131
Tansy and her, uh...
her crazy girl logic

31:39.165 --> 31:40.967
thinks that me not
wanting to kiss you

31:41.000 --> 31:42.368
means I have
feelings for you,

31:42.401 --> 31:45.571
so if I don't kiss you,
then she's gonna be pissed.

31:45.604 --> 31:49.175
So... look, I-I just hope you
brushed your teeth, Juliet,

31:49.208 --> 31:51.577
'cause you and I are gonna be
doing some major lip-locking.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.451
Well, well, well.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.553
The tables have turned.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.090
Ms. Curran, please, help us.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.558
We had no way of knowing
our new employee was a minor.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.060
Didn't you ask to see
her driver's license?

32:08.094 --> 32:09.061
Well,

32:09.095 --> 32:10.629
she presented the only two forms

32:10.662 --> 32:11.998
of identification
my partner checks.

32:12.031 --> 32:12.999
The point is,

32:13.032 --> 32:14.566
we're... we're a new business.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.969
We make mistakes.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.704
Surely, there must be some way

32:18.737 --> 32:21.040
we can make you forget
this ever happened, right?

32:21.073 --> 32:23.475
Don't smile at me
like that, Skeletor.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.345
But I think we can make a deal.

32:26.378 --> 32:27.346
What are you offering?

32:27.379 --> 32:30.182
Uh... free drinks for life?

32:30.216 --> 32:32.251
Lemon, you can't bribe
the Alcohol Control Board

32:32.284 --> 32:34.086
with free booze.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.988
Oh.
Uh...

32:36.022 --> 32:37.089
free breakfast?

32:38.657 --> 32:40.159
Free lunch.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.193
Oh, yes.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.561
That's sweet.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.063
But I think you both know

32:44.096 --> 32:46.065
exactly what it's going to take.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.600
(laughs)
Fine.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.669
You're hired.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.671
(giggling):
Yes.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.508
(flute plays)

32:57.543 --> 33:00.546
All the world is a stage.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.515
And all the men and women

33:03.549 --> 33:05.317
merely players.

33:05.351 --> 33:08.320
They have their exits
and their entrances.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.456
And one man in his time

33:10.489 --> 33:12.624
plays many parts.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.628
His act being seven ages.

33:16.662 --> 33:20.166
At first, the infant,
mewling and puking

33:20.199 --> 33:22.234
in his nurse's arms.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.036
And then the whining schoolboy,

33:24.070 --> 33:25.037
with his satchel

33:25.071 --> 33:28.340
and shining
morning face,

33:28.374 --> 33:30.042
creeping like a snail

33:30.076 --> 33:32.744
unwillingly
to school.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.281
AnnaBeth.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.548
Oh.

33:36.582 --> 33:37.816
Hey, there.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.485
I got your message.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.087
I'm sorry about
your migraines.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.089
No, I'm sorry for leaving you
in the lurch.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.390
You okay?

33:44.423 --> 33:46.058
Well, I have to do my scene

33:46.092 --> 33:47.359
with Dale King
from second grade,

33:47.393 --> 33:49.261
who I know is a stalker
and may try

33:49.295 --> 33:50.662
to peel my skin off later,

33:50.696 --> 33:52.131
but otherwise I'm fine.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.132
(chuckles)
Guess doing

33:53.165 --> 33:54.400
one of these things
with the man

33:54.433 --> 33:56.135
I care about
is just not in the cards.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.637
AnnaBeth, I lied.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.506
I don't get migraines.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.574
It's just,
I tried acting once.

34:02.608 --> 34:03.709
I stunk.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.377
I don't want to go
through that again.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.146
Well, you probably
don't even remember...

34:07.179 --> 34:09.315
The middle school
production of The Wiz.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.315
Who could forget?

34:10.349 --> 34:11.317
Uh...

34:11.350 --> 34:13.185
But, Lavon,

34:13.219 --> 34:14.553
this time will be different.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.522
This time, you're
doing a show with me.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.824
No matter what,
it will be something we did.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.527
Our first town event.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.563
And if we stink?

34:24.596 --> 34:27.199
Then we stink together.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.772
Patricia?

34:33.804 --> 34:34.773
Quinn?

34:34.806 --> 34:36.175
Ruth?

34:36.208 --> 34:37.275
Susie?

34:37.309 --> 34:38.844
Where are you?

34:38.877 --> 34:40.446
Wanda! Wanda,
I got your message.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.447
Is everything all right?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.848
No, Tom, nothing

34:42.880 --> 34:44.183
is all right.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.652
Our bees... gone.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.587
Okay, don't worry,
we will find them.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.456
We... we have to put on
something more colorful.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.623
We have to look
like flowers.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.560
(Wanda squeals)

34:56.762 --> 34:58.864
Go to.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.466
I'm no more on it.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.834
It hath made me mad!

35:02.868 --> 35:04.536
I say we will have

35:04.570 --> 35:06.638
no more marriage!

35:06.672 --> 35:08.807
Those that are married
already, all but one

35:08.840 --> 35:10.376
shall live.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.878
The rest shall keep

35:12.911 --> 35:15.314
as they are.

35:15.347 --> 35:18.684
To a nunnery. Go.

35:18.717 --> 35:19.885
MAN:
Yes!

35:19.918 --> 35:21.387
(applause, cheers)

35:23.522 --> 35:25.257
(whistling)

35:30.929 --> 35:32.398
DASH:
And as Romeo

35:32.431 --> 35:34.733
comes upon Juliet's
seemingly dead body,

35:34.766 --> 35:36.668
we begin.
(flute plays)

35:39.305 --> 35:41.307
Arms...

35:41.340 --> 35:43.275
take your last embrace.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.377
And, lips, O you:

35:45.411 --> 35:47.579
the doors of
breath seal

35:47.613 --> 35:49.548
with a righteous kiss.

35:49.581 --> 35:52.451
(music continues playing)

35:56.488 --> 35:57.623
Whoa!

35:57.656 --> 35:59.458
No need for kisses,

35:59.491 --> 36:00.659
because I'm totally fine.

36:00.692 --> 36:01.927
What? No, you're not.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.495
Close call, Romeo.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.533
Oh! It must be a vision.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.935
Thou who is obviously dead

36:09.968 --> 36:10.936
appeareth awake.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.472
Oh, foul ghost,
leave me.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.775
Allow me to kiss
my very dead Juliet.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.411
No! Not a ghost at all.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.546
I liveth!

36:20.579 --> 36:22.414
I super-duper liveth.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.483
No kiss necessary.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.685
But I feel death coming.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.687
Nope. There's no death.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.756
Because it wasn't
really poison.

36:30.789 --> 36:31.957
It was just a
sleeping potion,

36:31.990 --> 36:33.792
and now it has worn off.

36:33.825 --> 36:36.295
And... happy ending!

36:36.328 --> 36:38.297
I see how it must be thus.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.465
Thus.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.502
(music ends)

36:43.535 --> 36:44.603
But surely thou

36:44.636 --> 36:47.239
wouldst feel healthier...

36:47.273 --> 36:48.507
with a kiss.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.841
(Zoe gasps)

36:58.016 --> 36:59.518
Now...

36:59.551 --> 37:02.488
with a kiss, I die.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.723
(applause)

37:04.756 --> 37:05.991
(grunts)

37:06.024 --> 37:08.360
Damn it.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.965
Table four is good to go.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.434
So, uh...

37:15.467 --> 37:16.768
the new cook's

37:16.802 --> 37:18.270
only here on a
temporary basis.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.271
So I'm sorry

37:19.305 --> 37:21.473
if there's any, uh...

37:21.507 --> 37:22.908
Well, now, you know,

37:22.941 --> 37:24.643
it really is quite good.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.378
It is?
Mm-hmm.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.614
Well, all right.
(chuckles)

37:28.647 --> 37:29.881
Yo, congrats.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.883
Excuse me?

37:31.917 --> 37:34.486
Hey, she's no me,
but the new chick

37:34.520 --> 37:35.921
can really fry a fish.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.523
And, man, she's hot.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.258
*

37:41.860 --> 37:43.795
(giggles)

37:45.397 --> 37:47.032
Yeah, I know.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.300
I have no idea

37:48.334 --> 37:49.501
what was going on with Zoe,

37:49.535 --> 37:50.536
but I kissed her,

37:50.569 --> 37:51.603
and I kissed her for you.

37:51.637 --> 37:54.340
And you can see that there
is nothing going on there,

37:54.373 --> 37:55.474
and you can believe me

37:55.507 --> 37:57.676
because I'm not
that good of an actor.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.045
Okay.

38:00.078 --> 38:03.281
Let me go get you a tea, okay?

38:04.115 --> 38:07.619
*

38:07.653 --> 38:08.887
Tansy,

38:08.920 --> 38:10.356
I have to talk to you.
It's urgent.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.757
Lavon.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.891
Hey.

38:12.924 --> 38:13.925
You were great.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.694
(laughs)

38:15.727 --> 38:16.895
Yeah, I know, right?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.964
Who knew Lavon Hayes
could act?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.532
Oh.
Yeah, I see a whole new

38:20.566 --> 38:21.667
future career for my myself.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.935
Well, I mean, you were great,
but BlueBell needs you

38:23.969 --> 38:25.937
a heck of a lot
more than Broadway.
Mm-hmm.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.873
Look, I was so proud of you,
putting yourself out there.

38:27.906 --> 38:28.874
What happened?

38:28.907 --> 38:29.941
AnnaBeth happened.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.111
Yeah, I-I told her my fears,
and they just went away.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.813
Y-You know, I don't know
what's going on

38:34.846 --> 38:37.449
with you and Shelby,
but... but just talk to her.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.485
Thank you.

38:43.855 --> 38:44.890
Congratulations.

38:44.923 --> 38:47.025
The food is still disgusting,
so I guess that means

38:47.058 --> 38:48.694
that you knocked it
out of the park.

38:48.727 --> 38:49.961
(chuckles)

38:49.995 --> 38:51.697
Nice job.
Heard you gave quite
a performance

38:51.730 --> 38:52.831
tonight.

38:52.864 --> 38:53.965
Don't reckon you'll
be running off

38:53.999 --> 38:55.867
to make it on Broadway
any time soon.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.103
That's for sure.
You kissed George Tucker?

38:58.136 --> 38:59.971
I did.
How was that?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.407
None of your business.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.810
Sorry.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.144
Just so you know,

39:06.177 --> 39:08.847
not in small part
due to you,

39:08.880 --> 39:11.116
I am very, very messed up.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.718
I know.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.554
And, uh... I'm sorry.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.026
(sighs)

39:21.059 --> 39:23.061
(crickets chirping)

39:24.663 --> 39:25.831
Hey.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.533
There you are.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.735
You didn't come
to the party.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.870
Oh, I wasn't in
a party mood.

39:31.903 --> 39:35.006
Magnolia and I watched
 America's Next Top Model.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.876
Turns out we both hated
the girl that got kicked off,

39:37.909 --> 39:40.178
so... seeing some progress.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.547
(chuckles)

39:41.580 --> 39:43.882
I'm surprised to see you

39:43.915 --> 39:45.517
before I fell asleep.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.956
Look...

39:50.989 --> 39:53.158
Shelby...

39:53.191 --> 39:55.961
you're right,
I was avoiding you.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.896
The thing is,

39:57.929 --> 39:59.164
there's something...

39:59.197 --> 40:01.667
I was afraid to tell you.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.035
What?

40:04.069 --> 40:06.505
Why?

40:06.538 --> 40:09.441
Brick, I love you.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.577
I love you so much

40:11.610 --> 40:15.046
that I am putting up with living
with your teenage daughter.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.948
There is nothing that
I can't take now.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.852
Okay.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.789
Well...

40:23.822 --> 40:25.657
See, the thing is,

40:25.691 --> 40:28.527
it started
the other week...

40:28.560 --> 40:30.061
*

40:33.699 --> 40:34.866
(clears throat)

40:34.900 --> 40:35.967
Hey.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.202
Hey.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.672
I am sorry for how
I behaved onstage.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.474
Yeah, you did go
a little bit...

40:42.508 --> 40:43.542
Nuts.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.143
I was gonna say "off book."

40:45.176 --> 40:46.878
I don't know,
I guess I thought that

40:46.912 --> 40:49.715
it would be weird, us kissing.
Huh.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.083
And the alternative
you concocted

40:52.117 --> 40:53.652
was completely normal?

40:53.685 --> 40:54.886
Well, you know what was weird

40:54.920 --> 40:57.122
was that it wasn't weird.

40:57.155 --> 41:00.926
I kissed you, and I felt
absolutely nothing.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.494
So, good news, sir.

41:02.528 --> 41:05.163
I am completely over you.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.633
That is great,
great news, Zoe Hart.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.900
Good. (chuckles)

41:10.736 --> 41:12.203
"Wanda's bees made
a hive in my trailer.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.238
I'm homeless."

41:13.271 --> 41:14.506
How did that happen?

41:14.540 --> 41:15.874
Me?

41:15.907 --> 41:17.142
Well, I don't know how.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.143
I closed the top.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.045
I think. Oh, God.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.713
Hey, hey, hey.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.682
Hey, Tans?

41:23.715 --> 41:25.283
Why don't you just come
live with me

41:25.316 --> 41:26.918
on my houseboat
for a little while

41:26.952 --> 41:28.286
until they fix your
trailer up, hmm?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.755
I would love that.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.891
You guys are living together.

41:32.924 --> 41:33.892
(chuckles)
Yay! See?

41:33.925 --> 41:35.794
Happy endings, everyone.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.596
Well, I'm gonna
leave you guys to it.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.698
But big congrats!

41:40.666 --> 41:42.200
Bye.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.235
