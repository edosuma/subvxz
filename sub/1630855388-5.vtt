WEBVTT

00:27.361 --> 00:28.487
Who did this?

00:30.322 --> 00:31.490
Who let him get like this?

00:33.283 --> 00:34.326
They tried to help him.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.208
You, you're the doctor, right?

00:41.792 --> 00:42.876
Tell me he's gonna make it.

00:45.504 --> 00:49.091
Right now he's stable,
and that's about as much as I can say.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.802
Right. Stay with him.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.389
The rest of you, out.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.811
I made a phone call.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.063
I phoned Mum.

01:05.816 --> 01:06.859
That's okay, mate.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.155
Out!

01:21.373 --> 01:22.374
Where's Dad?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.878
He's just helping a poorly man out, mate.

01:43.812 --> 01:44.813
How is he?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.316
Do you mind if I get a water?

01:53.906 --> 01:54.907
Thanks.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.537
Thanks, Anna.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.622
Keep moving.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.132
Back in your seat.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.610
Well?

02:32.819 --> 02:34.780
Are you gonna tell us
what the hell's been going on?

02:55.092 --> 02:56.093
What flag is that?

02:57.511 --> 02:58.345
Italy.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.638
The other way around.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.518
Hungary. Why?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.522
I've been thinkingâ€¦

03:12.776 --> 03:14.069
maybe we can end this.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.629
-No, I know.
-Right now, it's just--

04:13.712 --> 04:15.797
The main thing we need to find out--

04:15.881 --> 04:17.048
The home secretary.

04:18.884 --> 04:19.968
Neil, we've been calling you.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.429
-Louise, where are you right now?
-Collingwood House.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.056
What the hell are you doing there?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.641
Because that's where we ended up.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.270
I've been handed an envelope
marked "demands."

04:30.354 --> 04:31.396
Demands?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.773
We're actually not far from you.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.733
-What sort of demands?
-We can be in Collingwood

04:34.816 --> 04:36.235
-in less than two minutes.
-Neil.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.612
And then we can discuss this together.

04:39.488 --> 04:43.784
I need you to get in touch with the
security at Whitehall to check that CCTV.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.912
I need an ID on the man
who handed me this envelope.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.539
Now, please.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.596
The home secretary's been handed a letter.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.850
It may have nothing to do with
any of this, but he wants to share it,

05:09.309 --> 05:10.644
so I've suggested he come in.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.732
We don't focus on the hijackers.
They'll be too careful.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.901
We focus on the friends and family

05:17.985 --> 05:21.655
'cause if they're on social media,
they'll give these guys away.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.325
The mother's house.
Search it. Get whatever you can.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.411
You may as well go together.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.581
Okay. Good.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.801
Morning, everyone.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.553
Morning, Louise.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.930
-Right. I've been given this.
-Excuse me.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.349
It's quite short, so I'll read it first.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.686
You can tell me if it tallies
with anything that you have.

05:55.397 --> 05:59.943
"For the attention of the home secretary
and members of the UK government.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.447
On the 7th of January 2023,

06:03.530 --> 06:07.618
Edgar Janssen and John Bailey-Brown
were wrongfully imprisoned.

06:07.701 --> 06:13.498
As a direct result of this,
Flight KA29 has been hijacked."

06:14.666 --> 06:18.629
"This is your opportunity
to right that wrong.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.174
You have the time it takes
for the plane to reach London

06:22.758 --> 06:24.551
to release these men from prison.

06:24.635 --> 06:29.139
Failure to do so or comply
with any subsequent instructions

06:29.223 --> 06:36.063
will result in the death of
all 216 people on board."

06:39.483 --> 06:44.363
So, there's quite a bit
to think about there, then.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.872
Whose mum?

06:53.956 --> 06:55.958
No. He said, "I called Mum."

06:57.167 --> 06:59.044
Not "my mum," but "Mum."

06:59.127 --> 07:00.754
-So they're brothers?
-Yeah.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.091
I mean, they could not be.
He could just know the younger guy's mum.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.218
No, no.
He said it like they were brothers.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.262
-Yeah.
-Guys, we're still over Romania.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.888
Should be for about another 15 minutes.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.349
So, if we do this, we should do it now.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.953
Can I say one thing, all right?

07:33.036 --> 07:34.955
Before you say anything,
just let me explain.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.332
Yeah?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.293
I think you need to land this.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.044
I'm not saying call it off
or anything like that.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.589
You can take off again
and keep this whole thing going,

07:43.672 --> 07:46.049
but he needs medical attention.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.509
-He's stable.
-He's dying.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.554
-The doctor said he's stable.
-Think about it.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.556
-You heard him.
-He's breathing through a Biro.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.642
He's gonna die.
If not now, before we get to London.

07:55.726 --> 07:56.560
Nah.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.395
No, not for one person.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.189
He's not one person though, is he?

08:01.398 --> 08:02.524
He's your brother.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.528
-Yeah? Where'd you get that from?
-His heart's not even in this.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.573
-Who said he's my brother?
-He doesn't wanna let you down.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.741
Who told you?

08:10.824 --> 08:11.825
He told me, okay?

08:11.909 --> 08:14.494
And now he's breathing through a pen,
and he's not gonna last.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.163
The doctor told me that.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.749
The doctor said he's stable.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.753
The doctor told you what you need to hear,
because he's fucking petrified.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.672
The fact is,
he's got air trapped in his lung,

08:25.756 --> 08:28.800
and that pen is not gonna last
the whole flight. That's a fact.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.596
Less than an hour.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.140
He said that?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.142
Less than an hour.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.727
That's what he says.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.563
You land this plane.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.653
You get your brother the help he needs,
or you lose him.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.741
That's the choice.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.622
Less than an hour.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.334
That was the phrase, was it?

09:04.253 --> 09:05.587
Let's ask him, shall we?

09:06.505 --> 09:10.133
I'll go there now and ask him
how long he thinks he's got.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.677
No sugarcoating it this time.

09:13.971 --> 09:19.768
And if he says any different,
someone else gets it. And they will.

09:22.813 --> 09:23.814
Trust me.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.319
The more you do, the easier it gets.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.198
Yeah?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.332
I'm sorry.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.298
-Oi!
-How do I call the back? What button?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.632
-A-F-T.
-Back in your seat.

09:50.716 --> 09:51.717
Yeah.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.720
-Now!
-Less than an hour.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.350
Coming.

10:10.903 --> 10:11.737
Hello?

10:14.156 --> 10:15.115
I'm sorry?

10:15.199 --> 10:16.909
That's the message. Less than an hour.
That--

10:20.162 --> 10:22.414
You told me he was stable,
but he's not, is he?

10:29.505 --> 10:31.757
This tube that's helping him,
it's not gonna last, is it?

10:31.840 --> 10:35.093
Tell me the truth now. No fucking about.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.387
How long's he got?

10:42.726 --> 10:43.977
Well, less than an hour.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.031
There is a long history in this country,

10:56.114 --> 10:59.076
and it's fairly well-known
that we do not negotiate with terrorists.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.037
Can we not just walk in here
and start calling them that, please?

11:02.120 --> 11:03.247
Whatever we're calling them--

11:03.330 --> 11:06.458
They're an organized crime group.
A proficient one.

11:07.709 --> 11:11.255
The point being,
we cannot be seen to be blackmailed.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.716
That is the line we always take,
is it not?

11:14.800 --> 11:19.555
Well, absolutely.
We cannot be seen to be blackmailed.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.223
Go on.

11:21.306 --> 11:25.811
Well, never before have
so many UK nationals been held hostage,

11:25.894 --> 11:28.522
and never with such a time clock.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.440
Two hours, 49 minutes.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.776
Not that it's playing on our minds
or anything.

11:34.862 --> 11:39.116
There is one question we need to answer
before we do anything else.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.033
Are these te--

11:41.159 --> 11:45.956
Is this OCG
likely to make good this threat?

11:46.540 --> 11:48.792
Do we have any evidence of
anything they've done

11:48.876 --> 11:52.754
that demonstrates that they have it
in their makeup to see this through?

11:52.838 --> 11:55.674
If you're asking if they've ever
hijacked a plane before--

11:55.757 --> 11:58.969
That's not what I'm asking,
and you know it's not.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.805
I want context.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.559
Evidence first,
that we take them seriously enough

12:05.642 --> 12:08.187
that they're even contemplating these.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.315
That's what I want to know.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.959
Gala.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.590
Gala.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.481
Can Gala come and play?

12:53.398 --> 12:54.441
What's that, mate?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.694
I think you've got the wrong house, pal.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.196
Come back tomorrow.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.626
Hi. This is Sam Nelson.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.294
Leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

14:38.754 --> 14:42.424
Guess what, Dad. I'm at your place.
I can't wait to see you.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.876
I'm not saying we do it,
I'm saying it's an option.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.294
There are no options.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.172
We do what we said we'd do. End of.

15:22.256 --> 15:25.634
He's my brother. Your mate.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.345
You and him used to be together.

15:30.013 --> 15:30.973
That was nothing.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.141
Not to him.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.105
Oi.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.984
Get your hand off me.

15:42.568 --> 15:43.485
He's dying.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.112
Now.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.241
Think of all the things
that could go wrong.

15:50.117 --> 15:53.412
Then think of all the stuff
to do with the plane and taking off again,

15:53.495 --> 15:56.206
that you know nothing about,
that could go wrong as well.

15:56.290 --> 15:59.293
What could go more wrong than
my little brother dying in front of you?

16:16.602 --> 16:17.644
Come on.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.901
-If we do thisâ€¦
-Yeah.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.486
â€¦if, how will it work?

16:28.113 --> 16:28.947
Wha--

16:31.200 --> 16:33.076
Well, first thing is to decide quickly.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.454
You can't just land a plane this size
without warning.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.164
You need to ask the others first.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.209
-We need to speak to the ground.
-Did you not hear what I said?

16:40.292 --> 16:43.003
And turn the screens back on,
just for a minute, so I can see the map.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.214
So I can work out
which airport we need to persuade.

16:45.881 --> 16:46.798
Persuade?

16:46.882 --> 16:47.883
To let us land.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.303
Not everyone wants
a hijacked plane coming their way.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.480
We need someone to land the plane.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.483
We're flying over Hungary.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.193
-You speak Hungarian, yes?
-Yeah, but--

17:06.276 --> 17:09.570
We need to persuade the Hungarians
to let us land this plane.

17:09.655 --> 17:12.199
The Hungarian air traffic control
speak English.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.785
-I know. No, I know.
-You don't need Hungarian.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.704
I-- We do, because the hijackers don't.

17:17.788 --> 17:22.917
So if you can get a message down to them
in Hungarian, this could all be over.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.591
Come on, mate.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.219
Keep talking. Keep looking.

17:32.302 --> 17:36.139
Come on. What do you wanna talk about?
You wanna talk about music?

17:36.765 --> 17:37.766
Football?

17:38.350 --> 17:41.436
Don't know why I said football.
I know fuck all about football.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.981
Although I did hear once that you're meant
to be a Leeds fan, you know.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.357
And if you're not a fan of Leeds,

17:45.440 --> 17:48.360
then you're not worth having as a fan,
apparently.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.824
You're not from Leeds, are you?
You sound like Londoners.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.910
Is that where you're from?
Kent? Or London or somewhere?

17:56.994 --> 17:57.995
Help me.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.665
What was that, mate? Say again.

18:04.918 --> 18:05.919
Help me.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.341
Help me.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.894
If we could crush those up,

18:21.977 --> 18:25.063
and then we're gonna
dissolve them in some water, yeah?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.356
Then we'll help him drink it.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.903
-How many?
-All of them.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.571
Is that safe?

18:50.631 --> 18:51.632
Mum, look.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.286
They all speak basic English,
but none of them are fluent.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.914
What we're asking, permission,

19:23.997 --> 19:25.624
landing protocols,
it's all pretty technical.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.042
Anna will help us explain.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.294
We're only asking.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.004
I wanna be sure
they can have doctors waiting

19:31.088 --> 19:32.756
before we even think about landing.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.759
We start by telling them
that all the passengers are safe, okay?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.720
They do not want to inherit
a violent situation.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.890
This is all about
getting medical assistance.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.684
We need to take off again afterwards.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.312
Say it.

19:48.772 --> 19:52.901
In Hungarian,
"We need medical assistance."

19:54.653 --> 19:56.154
We need medical assistance.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.992
That's what you tell them.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.911
You're not committing to anything,
remember? You check with me first.

20:04.705 --> 20:05.789
You okay with--

20:06.707 --> 20:08.125
You okay with doing all of that?

20:09.668 --> 20:10.669
Yeah.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.213
But I don't want him here.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.761
I don't want him anywhere near me.

20:25.017 --> 20:28.145
The Cheapside Firm,
headed by Edgar Janssen, on the left,

20:28.228 --> 20:29.104
and John Bailey-Brown.

20:29.188 --> 20:32.482
They're an organized crime group
working in the international drug trade.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.735
They're not dealers or smugglers.

20:34.818 --> 20:38.697
What they do is they run the network.
The tracks, not the trains.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.241
British drug smugglers are only as good
as their points of entry.

20:41.325 --> 20:44.494
So once a gang has found a secure way in,
they tend to stick to it.

20:44.578 --> 20:47.581
And these points of entry are all
controlled by the Cheapside Firm?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.499
Yeah. But it's not just drugs.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.001
Sex workers, weapons,

20:51.084 --> 20:55.797
a network running all across Europe
that wasn't busted until November.

20:55.881 --> 21:00.135
And these two each got 35 years.
They're also ruthless individuals.

21:00.219 --> 21:02.638
Right.
Well, this is where we do take the lead.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.139
Who are they?

21:04.223 --> 21:08.727
Which agencies, databases,
PNC, HOLMES 2, hold their records?

21:09.311 --> 21:11.188
And most importantly, where are they now?

21:11.271 --> 21:13.023
HMP Thorpe, just outside London.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.317
We're also checking all Whitehall CCTV

21:15.400 --> 21:16.944
for images on the man
who gave you the envelope, too.

21:17.027 --> 21:17.861
Thank you.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.739
To be clear, I understood
we weren't considering this.

21:20.822 --> 21:24.535
We're not, but I'm just getting context.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.662
We need to be prepared.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.929
These are damaged. I need mine.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.189
Budapest, this is Kingdom 2-9.
Can you hear me?

21:55.774 --> 21:58.777
Don't try anything clever.
You'll end up getting people killed.

21:58.861 --> 22:01.363
Kingdom 2-9,
we have a red flag against you.

22:01.864 --> 22:03.031
Please give your status.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.284
Budapest,
we have had an incident on board.

22:05.868 --> 22:09.037
All passengers are safe.
But we now require your cooperation.

22:10.998 --> 22:13.667
-Cooperation?
-I'm gonna switch to Hungarian now.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.336
Budapestâ€¦

22:17.254 --> 22:19.006
We need medical assistance.

22:20.549 --> 22:21.633
Kingdom 2-9?

22:22.259 --> 22:24.136
Confirm your status for me, please.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.599
I have English speakers on board,

22:28.682 --> 22:32.978
so for them and for you I can confirm
the incident on board has been resolved,

22:33.061 --> 22:36.148
but we now are in need of
urgent medical assistance.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.524
Doctors waiting.

22:38.317 --> 22:41.945
-Doctors waiting at GyÃ¶r Airport.
-And an ambulance on the runway.

22:42.029 --> 22:43.697
An ambulance on the runway.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.033
But please understandâ€¦

22:46.116 --> 22:48.243
The Hijack is still happening.

23:11.975 --> 23:14.228
112. There. Says it on the bins.

23:19.608 --> 23:21.610
Charlie Two, moving into position.

23:38.627 --> 23:39.711
Look at that.

23:39.795 --> 23:42.464
Two hundred lives at stake,
and she's still wearing her dressing gown.

23:42.548 --> 23:43.590
Go ahead.

23:43.674 --> 23:44.842
We've got eyes on Elaine.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.135
We're checking
if there's anybody else at the property.

23:47.219 --> 23:50.472
All right. As soon as you're ready,
I want you to go straight in. Understood?

23:50.973 --> 23:51.974
Copy that.

24:04.862 --> 24:06.655
They've taken the pilots back.

24:07.239 --> 24:08.407
-Who has?
-We have.

24:10.075 --> 24:15.956
They came and took the other one
out of her seat. The female pilot.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.086
Kingdom 2-9â€¦

24:21.170 --> 24:23.672
We cannot give permission to land.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.507
Not till we speak to our superiors.

24:25.591 --> 24:27.467
-What's she saying?
-She's trying to get us permission

24:27.551 --> 24:28.802
to land at GyÃ¶r Airport.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.805
A nice steady voice.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.140
You must sound calm.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.559
Kingdom 2-9, this is above my job level.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.144
Why's she still talking?

24:37.227 --> 24:39.563
I have 200 people on board.
This is our only chance.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.356
-Why are you talking?
-It's complicated, I think.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.441
Am I asking you?

24:46.695 --> 24:47.654
Say it in English.

24:51.617 --> 24:53.368
Thank you for considering our request,
Budapest.

24:53.452 --> 24:56.580
We are minus 19 from GyÃ¶r Airport,

24:57.539 --> 24:58.832
in anticipation of your decisionâ€¦

25:02.669 --> 25:04.129
We will begin a gradual descent.

25:06.715 --> 25:09.468
Tell them we need "armed units".

25:10.093 --> 25:11.720
Soldiers on the ground.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.472
Thisâ€¦ this is an unscheduled landing!

25:27.819 --> 25:29.571
There. Can you feel it?

25:36.662 --> 25:38.038
We are going down.

25:39.081 --> 25:41.375
Look, the clouds are going up.

25:56.807 --> 25:57.850
What?

25:59.518 --> 26:00.519
We're landing.

26:03.564 --> 26:04.648
Last bit.

26:09.528 --> 26:10.362
Go on.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.116
There you go.

26:22.207 --> 26:25.419
If we're landing, that's good.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.337
There'll be doctors to help you.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.093
I don't understand.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.848
Elaine Atterton?

26:38.891 --> 26:41.476
You're the mother
of Lewis and Stuart Atterton, yeah?

26:41.560 --> 26:43.478
You don't just come in here.

26:43.562 --> 26:45.189
You wanna tell me
who they're involved with?

26:45.272 --> 26:46.773
You wanna tell me
who they're with right now?

26:46.857 --> 26:47.858
Get off that.

26:47.941 --> 26:51.278
You might wanna tell us, Elaine.
Stop yourself getting arrested.

26:51.361 --> 26:52.779
Don't know what you're on about.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.033
Sit down.

26:56.116 --> 26:58.577
I don't know anything about anything.

26:59.786 --> 27:00.787
Down.

27:10.506 --> 27:13.550
Listen to me carefully.
We don't have a lot of time.

27:14.593 --> 27:16.470
I think you know why we're here, Elaine.

27:16.553 --> 27:18.889
What your sons are involved in,
and how serious this is.

27:18.972 --> 27:22.059
And I think we're gonna find activity
on this that's gonna prove it.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.938
-Please, you're making a mistake.
-So either you start talking,

27:26.021 --> 27:29.775
or you'll be detained
under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act.

27:30.609 --> 27:33.362
And trust me, Elaine,
that's not a happy place to be.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.989
See, this is the thing.

27:36.490 --> 27:41.161
All of the people that we're trying
to saveâ€¦ they have families too.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.001
I have the PM ready to get on the line.

27:48.085 --> 27:49.878
She can be phone, video,
whatever's encoded.

27:49.962 --> 27:51.630
I've got the FPCC for you, right now.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.257
FPCC first, please.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.633
Are you joking?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.552
I want the latest information.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.888
-You're putting the PM on hold?
-Because she will too.

28:00.639 --> 28:01.765
Thank you.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.475
Putting you on speaker.

28:05.978 --> 28:08.105
We have a possible request to land.

28:09.106 --> 28:11.066
There's talk of
a medical incident onboard.

28:11.149 --> 28:12.943
Now, this is all secondhand information,

28:13.026 --> 28:14.695
but there's no reason
the Hungarians would lie.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.781
What you're looking at now
is still Romanian feed,

28:18.824 --> 28:22.828
but as you can see,
it's on course for GyÃ¶r.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.746
And they know about the hijacking?

28:24.830 --> 28:26.748
Yes. Yeah, and we've confirmed it.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.877
And? Will they let it land?

28:29.960 --> 28:31.461
They're talking right now.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.131
But this is an easy request to refuse.

28:34.214 --> 28:36.633
So, the feeling here is
there must be a chance.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.511
And this is why we hold our nerve.

28:39.595 --> 28:43.599
See what these hooligans are made of
before we let them amble out of prison.

28:58.197 --> 28:59.907
I saw the family go inside.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.242
Then these cleaners came out.

29:02.326 --> 29:03.327
They lock the door.

29:03.410 --> 29:04.870
Then they drive away.

29:05.537 --> 29:08.624
We keep knocking but no one's answering.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.542
Something is wrong.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.848
Attention! Gather around.

30:05.931 --> 30:08.809
One magazine loaded. One backup pistol.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.936
We move out onto the runway in a bus

30:11.019 --> 30:13.355
and wait for further instructions.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.941
Whichever door the medics are called to,

30:16.024 --> 30:18.026
we strike from the opposite side.

30:18.110 --> 30:19.820
-Do I make myself clear?
-Yes, Captain!

30:19.903 --> 30:21.154
C'mon let's do it!

30:23.198 --> 30:24.992
Budapest, we are at 12,000 feet.

30:25.075 --> 30:26.076
We need your decision.

30:27.661 --> 30:29.913
Our decision is coming.

30:31.039 --> 30:31.874
Decision is coming.

30:31.957 --> 30:36.670
We get permission.
You ask the others. Everyone has to agree.

30:37.671 --> 30:38.672
Stuart!

30:55.647 --> 30:57.107
Kingdom 2-9â€¦

31:00.569 --> 31:03.655
We understand the hijackers intend
to take off again?

31:06.408 --> 31:07.242
That is correct.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.584
But we understand
that it is your private wishâ€¦

31:15.667 --> 31:17.544
for them not to do so.

31:17.628 --> 31:18.504
Are we landing or what?

31:19.588 --> 31:20.923
Is that correct?

31:22.090 --> 31:23.300
That is correct.

31:27.971 --> 31:30.349
You have permission to land.

31:32.351 --> 31:33.894
Thank you, Budapest.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.563
I think everybody on board
will be happy to hear that.

31:36.647 --> 31:39.525
Armed units waiting on the ground.

31:39.608 --> 31:40.859
What's she saying?

31:40.943 --> 31:42.319
Ambulance is waiting.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.489
You have permission to land.

31:46.365 --> 31:47.199
Do it.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.243
-You don't get to decide.
-Do it.

31:54.248 --> 31:57.709
Budapest, we are at 10,000 feet.
We are beginning our final descent.

32:00.754 --> 32:02.005
It's not his decision.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.216
He can't just land it.

32:05.509 --> 32:06.510
Tell him!

32:17.437 --> 32:19.898
-It's a suicide mission.
-He's dying.

32:19.982 --> 32:21.233
For all of us.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.861
Why, though? We got hostages.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.946
Whoever's down there,
there's nothing they can do.

32:26.029 --> 32:29.157
We get given a job. We get the job done.

32:29.241 --> 32:31.368
We will get it done.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.912
Exactly like we said we would.

32:36.081 --> 32:37.457
Otherwise what?

32:42.004 --> 32:43.505
Otherwise what?

32:46.216 --> 32:47.676
Another call from Lewis.

32:47.759 --> 32:50.512
The same number
that called your landline from the plane.

32:53.265 --> 32:56.602
You tell us what the plan is,
what you know.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.563
It doesn't matter what I know,
they'll have made their minds up.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.899
And once they've done that,
there ain't no stopping this.

33:01.982 --> 33:03.400
It's our job to stop them.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.611
You're asking what I know,
and I'm telling you.

33:06.195 --> 33:09.531
They'll come for you
just like they'll come for me.

33:10.490 --> 33:12.034
Just like they came for my Peter.

33:14.203 --> 33:16.580
Pete was with them 20 years, trusted.

33:18.123 --> 33:20.125
But when he crossed the line,
they sent someone 'round here

33:20.209 --> 33:21.502
to put a bullet inside him.

33:23.420 --> 33:24.880
Lewis was the one who found him,

33:24.963 --> 33:27.341
came home to find his old man
dead in the hall.

33:30.636 --> 33:32.638
Is somebody gonna tell us
what the hell's happening?

33:33.222 --> 33:35.098
Shut the fuck up.

33:46.151 --> 33:49.530
You need to stop it.
Tell them we don't need the landing.

33:49.613 --> 33:53.325
-Me?
-You tell them he's gonna be okay.

33:57.871 --> 33:59.373
We need to stop it, the landing.

33:59.873 --> 34:02.334
-We can take off again.
-We can't, they might stop us.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.836
If we don't stick to the plan,

34:03.919 --> 34:05.796
they'll kill us,
our families, your family.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.507
-My family?
-We sent your passport details to them.

34:09.299 --> 34:11.802
-Why my family?
-Any passenger causing problems.

34:11.885 --> 34:14.804
Anyone who might get in the way,
that's what we were told to do.

34:14.888 --> 34:17.933
And we do what they want, always.
We have to.

34:18.433 --> 34:19.434
Otherwise, it's over.

34:21.687 --> 34:22.896
How do you know that?

34:22.980 --> 34:26.483
The people we work for
had his old man shot.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.152
He went against them, he paid the price.
Didn't he?

34:31.362 --> 34:32.531
How do you know that?

34:34.449 --> 34:35.909
They were laying down a marker.

34:36.534 --> 34:38.120
They let everyone see they were serious.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.831
They sent a hit man round.

34:40.914 --> 34:42.708
They who? How do you know it was them?

34:44.083 --> 34:45.918
Because I was the hit man they sent.

34:50.382 --> 34:54.844
If I hadn't have done it,
they'd have shot me and sent someone else.

34:58.765 --> 35:02.811
And if we fuck this up,
they'll do it to your family and all.

35:04.104 --> 35:05.397
Sam Nelson.

35:10.027 --> 35:12.946
These people are serious.

35:15.157 --> 35:16.450
They live in this street.

35:18.368 --> 35:23.707
Their family, the relatives,
they live in the houses all along here.

35:26.001 --> 35:28.295
Edgar and Johnnie, they own the whole lot.

35:30.047 --> 35:32.132
And they'll send people to clean this up.

35:38.639 --> 35:41.099
Someone will have seen you arrive.
They know you're here.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.604
And they don't trust me
after what happened with Pete.

35:45.687 --> 35:51.235
After they thought he grassed,
but he never.

35:53.403 --> 35:54.905
And I never grassed neither.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.408
I know you didn't.

35:59.409 --> 36:00.536
You came to me.

36:01.954 --> 36:02.829
I know.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.749
I just want my boys.

36:11.672 --> 36:14.550
Can I get a tissue?

36:17.302 --> 36:18.136
Sure.

36:27.771 --> 36:29.398
What exactly has she told you?

36:31.483 --> 36:34.486
She's spoken to the younger Atterton
brother on the actual plane.

36:35.070 --> 36:36.071
She's admitted it.

36:36.154 --> 36:38.282
Get her out of there, secure the house,

36:38.365 --> 36:40.576
put her in a car, and take her
to the address I'm sending you.

36:41.243 --> 36:44.621
Learn it. Delete it. Do not put it
in your maps or your satnav.

36:44.705 --> 36:46.874
-Where are we taking her?
-Erica, don't be so naive.

36:46.957 --> 36:49.001
If they're taking hostages,
then so are we.

37:01.513 --> 37:02.681
Where is she?

37:02.764 --> 37:04.516
Got upset and went to get a tissue.

37:19.865 --> 37:21.783
Michael, at the back. At the back.

37:25.537 --> 37:26.914
Hey!

37:31.793 --> 37:35.339
Ladies and gentlemen, please
ensure your seat belts remain fastened.

37:35.422 --> 37:39.259
The plane will indeed be landing
but for medical reasons only.

37:39.343 --> 37:41.512
I repeat, this is a medical stop only.

37:41.595 --> 37:44.932
Remain in your seats.
The situation onboard is unchanged.

37:53.315 --> 37:55.442
Confirm visual on plane.

37:55.526 --> 37:56.860
Visual confirmed.

37:58.028 --> 38:01.657
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stow away any loose items.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.867
-Look there.
-Fold your tray table away.

38:04.493 --> 38:07.204
And return your seat
to the upright position.

38:07.287 --> 38:09.748
We are now beginning our final descent.

38:11.583 --> 38:12.584
Please.

38:13.919 --> 38:14.837
Hey.

38:19.466 --> 38:20.467
No landing.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.011
No landing.

38:27.015 --> 38:28.016
Oh, fuck.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.281
Hey!

39:01.967 --> 39:03.260
Elaine, no!

39:17.524 --> 39:20.652
We need to stop it, the landing.

39:21.403 --> 39:23.030
-We're not stopping nothing.
-Yeah.

39:23.113 --> 39:24.489
He's dying. They're waiting.

39:24.573 --> 39:25.741
Let them land it.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.619
This was your idea.

39:30.162 --> 39:31.371
My brother is dying.

39:31.455 --> 39:34.082
It's your brother that's saying it.
He doesn't want you to land.

39:36.793 --> 39:39.254
Ask him yourself, please.

39:55.604 --> 39:56.772
Where is it?

39:58.106 --> 40:01.026
The pen. Where the fuck's it gone?
What the fuck did you do?

40:01.109 --> 40:02.903
-Hey! Stop!
-What the fuck have you done?

40:02.986 --> 40:04.154
Look! Just look.

40:05.072 --> 40:08.158
We didn't do anything.
It's there in his hand.

40:11.828 --> 40:13.163
He did it himself.

40:22.548 --> 40:23.966
He didn't want you to save him.

40:27.010 --> 40:28.220
He wanted to save you.

41:16.101 --> 41:17.311
Abort the landing.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.855
Abort? We can't--

41:19.938 --> 41:23.108
Yeah. No, no. Abort the landing.

41:25.736 --> 41:27.112
We keep on going.

42:21.291 --> 42:24.086
All unitsâ€¦ Stand down.

42:24.169 --> 42:25.754
Repeat. All units, stand down.

42:39.560 --> 42:43.397
Kingdom 2-9 descended
to a low of 6,000 feet but did not land.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.483
It is now returning
to its cruising altitude.

42:47.818 --> 42:51.029
Budapest has attempted contact
since the aborted landing,

42:51.113 --> 42:55.158
but so far Kingdom 2-9 is not responding.

42:57.035 --> 42:59.454
Kingdom 2-9 is now 90 minutes away

42:59.538 --> 43:02.666
from the earliest point at which
we can have a direct dialogue.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.419
Give me one second.
You have Patrick from the PM's office.

43:06.879 --> 43:08.672
The situation is still live.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.382
There are casualties on board,

43:10.465 --> 43:12.593
requests for medical attention,
an aborted landing.

43:12.676 --> 43:15.554
But right now, the plane is still airborne

43:15.637 --> 43:18.307
and once again ignoring
all attempted contact from the ground.

43:19.099 --> 43:21.226
-You need to see this.
-You need to wait.

43:21.977 --> 43:23.061
All of you.

43:24.479 --> 43:26.148
Patrick, more as we have it.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.069
One of the baggage security staff

43:31.153 --> 43:33.614
who checked the business class passengers
onto KA29

43:33.697 --> 43:35.199
has been found dead in her home.

43:35.282 --> 43:37.117
The rest of her family
also have been murdered,

43:37.201 --> 43:39.786
leading them to speculate
that they might have been held captive

43:39.870 --> 43:42.080
so that she'd let the hijackers
onto the plane.

43:42.164 --> 43:45.584
A Dubai air traffic controller then went
looking for her. He's been found too.

43:46.084 --> 43:49.963
If anyone's squeamish,
maybe look away now.

43:51.715 --> 43:52.549
Jesus.

43:52.633 --> 43:54.801
That's what happens
when you do what they want.

43:55.844 --> 43:57.304
What was it you asked?

43:58.138 --> 43:59.681
Do they make good on their threat?

44:00.641 --> 44:02.768
I think you have the answer
to that question.
