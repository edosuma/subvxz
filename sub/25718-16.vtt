01:02.437 --> 01:03.521
Are you surprised?

01:04.855 --> 01:05.690
What?

01:08.026 --> 01:10.070
A little.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.616
Sorry.

01:15.283 --> 01:16.284
Oh, no.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.162
That's not it.

01:26.628 --> 01:30.423
Should we... sleep now?

01:33.843 --> 01:34.677
What?

01:35.386 --> 01:36.221
Huh?

01:37.972 --> 01:38.973
Oh, no.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.268
That's not what I meant.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.063
I mean sleep, literally.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.154
I didn't say anything.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.120
I'll sleep here...

02:00.203 --> 02:01.871
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY! </i>BY KI MAENG-GI

02:01.955 --> 02:03.873
...and catch the first bus. So, you go.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.251
No, I'll go with you.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.506
It'll be uncomfortable for you.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.758
It's fine. Don't worry.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.426
Maybe you can change.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.140
My dad's clothes won't fit you.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.851
I'm fine. Just go to bed.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.270
You won't sleep much.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.440
Okay.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.403
I'll go to sleep,
so you can sleep, too.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.614
Good night.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.659
Okay. Good night.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.726
<i>This doesn't feel real.</i>

03:06.352 --> 03:08.354
<i>It's not a dream, but it feels like one.</i>

03:16.487 --> 03:19.365
<i>Oh, that was my first kiss.</i>

03:59.489 --> 04:00.573
Oh, right!

04:18.548 --> 04:19.384
Sorry.

04:21.886 --> 04:22.720
It's okay.

04:26.015 --> 04:26.849
Good night.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.477
Okay.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.270
She left her phone here.

INCOMING CALL: MOM

<i>Hello?</i>

07:17.311 --> 07:18.521
Mi-rae, are you there?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.858
Hello?

07:21.941 --> 07:24.569
Oh, dear. Who are you?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.989
-Don't be scared.
-Who is this?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.617
I am Do Kyung-seok.

VIDEO CALL

07:44.297 --> 07:45.214
Hello.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.842
<i>Why did you answer Mi-rae's phone?</i>

07:48.342 --> 07:51.179
She is... sleeping right now.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.264
What? Where?

07:53.806 --> 07:57.059
In her room. I'm in the living room.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.654
But... why are you there?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.408
We came here together,
and I missed the last bus.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.952
Just the two of you?

08:15.995 --> 08:16.913
Yes.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.665
What's your relationship with Mi-rae?

08:20.833 --> 08:23.169
I'm her boyfriend.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.505
-You?
<i>-Yes.</i>

08:27.256 --> 08:28.633
You're going out with Mi-rae?

08:29.425 --> 08:30.259
Yes.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.054
So, you two are dating?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.014
Yes.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.017
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to surprise you.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.772
What are you doing out here?

08:44.106 --> 08:45.107
<i>Good night, then.</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:53.157
Who was that?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.618
Mi-rae's boyfriend.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.746
-What?
-Do you know who he is?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.750
That super-handsome boy!

VIDEO CALL

09:33.614 --> 09:34.949
<i>It's true.</i>

09:36.325 --> 09:37.618
Hi.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.580
<i>-So, you're dating Mi-rae?</i>
-Yes.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.541
I will tell you one thing.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.793
<i>We have CCTV at home.</i>

09:47.837 --> 09:49.839
<i>It records everything.</i>

09:50.756 --> 09:52.425
<i>Good night, then.</i>

10:44.226 --> 10:45.895
What time is it?

10:52.151 --> 10:56.197
Oh, no. I have to wash up
and put on make-up again.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.247
I slept without washing my face.
My skin must look so bad.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.878
I can't show him my bare skin.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.527
Why is he sleeping like that?
It must be uncomfortable.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.701
Where's the CCTV?

11:44.036 --> 11:44.870
You're awake?

11:45.329 --> 11:46.914
Where's the CCTV?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.332
CCTV?

11:49.667 --> 11:52.586
What are you talking about?
What kind of home has that?

12:01.262 --> 12:02.388
What's the matter?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.223
Did you have a dream?

12:04.765 --> 12:06.475
I'm gonna sleep ten more minutes.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.035
Drive slow. They left already.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.874
Why did Dad say  that?
Kyung-seok couldn't sleep.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.460
Why? Did he do something?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.380
He didn't do anything.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.800
You can't really speak
because he's right next you?

12:41.552 --> 12:42.386
Yeah.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.472
I'll talk to you later, then. Bye.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.441
So, they don't like me?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.027
Weren't you sleeping?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.280
I shouldn't have said hi that way.

13:01.363 --> 13:05.034
They must've not liked me.
That's why your dad mentioned the CCTV.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.706
-I shouldn't have answered the phone.
-Why? Are you worried?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.208
Of course.

13:13.876 --> 13:16.378
I've never seen you care
about someone so much.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.635
Of course. They're not just anyone.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.345
They're your parents.

13:27.264 --> 13:30.518
They're just curious
because I have a boyfriend.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.187
-That's all?
-Yes.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.815
So, don't worry and sleep.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.282
You didn't sleep much, either.
Aren't you tired?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.828
A little bit.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.415
Lean here.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.961
-What?
-Lean on me and get some sleep.

14:10.724 --> 14:11.934
You can lean over, too.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.789
It's obviously a hidden camera.
Why can't it be deleted?

14:34.331 --> 14:36.750
<i>-Are you the one in the picture?</i>
-Well...

14:44.174 --> 14:46.427
If it's a domestic site,
can't it be shut down?

14:46.802 --> 14:51.557
<i>We also consider this a harmful site.</i>
<i>But it's hard to shut it down.</i>

14:51.640 --> 14:53.893
<i>We can block the domain</i>
<i>so no one can access it.</i>

14:54.810 --> 15:00.107
And what if they post the picture
publicly or re-upload it?

15:00.441 --> 15:02.568
<i>We track down and delete the photos.</i>

15:02.985 --> 15:06.989
<i>You can file a complaint as a proxy,</i>
<i>but the victim has to testify anyway.</i>

15:58.207 --> 15:59.208
Hello?

16:12.596 --> 16:13.555
Hi.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.683
It's been a while.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.026
Who said this is me? Jang Won-ho?

16:26.318 --> 16:28.654
-Jo Jung-yeob?
-Does Jung-yeob know about this,?

16:30.614 --> 16:31.699
Won-ho!

16:32.449 --> 16:34.118
Did he spread the rumor?

16:34.326 --> 16:37.162
No. He came to see me
because he was worried about you.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.373
He told me that he would not say
a word to anyone.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.791
How can I trust him?

16:42.835 --> 16:43.669
Sua.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.714
I don't want to make you worry
for no reason.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.133
Wouldn't you be worried
if you just let it be like this?

16:50.384 --> 16:52.553
Don't you want to find who did this
and take them to court?

16:54.054 --> 16:57.516
The police will investigate
if they consider this a crime.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.811
I called, but they said
this is not considered a crime.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.397
So, the victim has to testify.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.025
Victim?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.317
What?

17:08.819 --> 17:11.530
No. I don't want to be
one of those weird girls.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.616
Why is the victim weird?
Whoever filmed you is weird.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.871
They did something wrong. But I'm the one
who has to deal with the rumors.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.166
Don't you know victims get harassed
after talking to the police?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.542
It makes more pictures circulate.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.421
That's why we have to investigate,
so it can stop.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.882
The police can track down
and delete the photos.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.092
They can trace the download
and catch the culprit.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.178
And...

17:35.220 --> 17:37.806
we can ask them not to make big noise
during the investigation.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.977
Once the police finds out who did this,
they'll arrest them. So, no worries.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.605
No.

17:48.942 --> 17:52.154
I don't want to do that.
Just leave me alone, please.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.118
-Bye.
-Sua.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.175
You were asleep when I came back.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.843
I wasn't late.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.932
Let's have dinner after freshening up?

18:20.641 --> 18:21.934
Okay. That sounds good.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.144
-See you later.
<i>-Okay.</i>

18:31.485 --> 18:33.278
-Hello?
-Yes.

18:34.696 --> 18:35.823
You hang up first.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.491
No, you first.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.492
No.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.702
Then, I will hang up first.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.788
See you later.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.289
Okay.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.420
I did not know hanging up the phone
would be this difficult.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.178
HI!

19:12.234 --> 19:13.110
What's up?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.904
My friend said she needs to tell me
something about Sua.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.615
Let's just meet tomorrow.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.119
What's there to talk about Sua?

19:22.452 --> 19:24.830
Sua is not well, you know.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.667
I'll just listen and come home.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.046
Don't go.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.009
Don't worry.
I'll call you when I get back.

20:28.435 --> 20:32.147
Maybe she didn't like you
because of those bad memories.

20:35.984 --> 20:39.446
I know Sua
has done a lot of things to you.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.323
She must have.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.079
It was hard
because I liked her in the beginning.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.793
Even though I am a girl,

20:53.252 --> 20:57.381
I felt nervous in front of Sua
because she's so pretty.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.926
When she told me we were friends,

21:01.635 --> 21:03.178
I was very happy.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.932
I'm ashamed now.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.310
But I felt pretty, too,

21:11.353 --> 21:14.147
because a pretty girl was my friend.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.781
Anyway, there is nothing I can do
for her now.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.950
And I don't want to.

21:27.202 --> 21:30.163
Of course. I understand.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.457
Maybe not now,

21:32.541 --> 21:35.168
but if you could still be her friend...

21:36.712 --> 21:38.880
that would change Sua's life.

21:43.885 --> 21:47.431
If I can't even change my own life,

21:48.098 --> 21:50.642
how could I change someone else's?

21:51.601 --> 21:53.812
The wounds caused by other people

21:54.563 --> 21:56.606
get cured by people.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.403
I don't understand that very well.
However, it's obvious...

22:02.612 --> 22:05.574
that the person who can make
the greatest impact on Sua

22:05.657 --> 22:09.286
is not Kyung-seok,
or anyone else for that matter.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.581
It is you.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.838
<i>Sua is not well, you know.</i>

22:21.256 --> 22:23.008
<i>I'll just listen and come home.</i>

22:24.968 --> 22:26.636
Stop being so nice.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.201
Is something wrong?

22:51.161 --> 22:52.079
No, nothing.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.628
Kyung-seok!

23:01.296 --> 23:03.173
Is anyone at school following Sua?

23:05.634 --> 23:06.510
Jang Won-ho?

23:09.262 --> 23:11.056
No, never mind.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.485
-Hello?
<i>-Where are you?</i>

23:24.152 --> 23:26.196
I'm in Eun's neighborhood.

23:28.865 --> 23:30.492
You don't have to pick me up.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.082
Okay.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.759
<i>I won't forgive you.</i>

23:48.927 --> 23:51.096
<i>Why did you mess with me?</i>

23:52.139 --> 23:54.516
<i>All you have is your face.</i>

23:55.267 --> 23:56.810
<i>I know where you live.</i>

23:57.144 --> 23:59.146
<i>I will do it and prove it tonight.</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:21.168
Next time,
I'll get you cat food, not this.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.004
You like this.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.482
Do you live around here?

24:45.025 --> 24:46.193
You despised me.

24:46.860 --> 24:47.694
What?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.416
Apologize.

25:12.594 --> 25:16.640
Kyung-seok likes you
more than you like him, right?

25:16.723 --> 25:21.520
No, it is not like more or less.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.231
The feelings cannot be equal.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.651
Usually, the person
who has stronger feelings calls,

25:27.734 --> 25:29.361
wants to meet, and gets mad.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.695
Gets mad?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.531
You guys haven't fought yet, right?

25:34.241 --> 25:37.327
I think we did before we dated.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.621
I'm not sure it was exactly a fight.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.376
Yes, Woo-young.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.088
Sua?

25:50.090 --> 25:52.884
Yes, I  live close by.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.430
Have you seen Sua today?

25:57.681 --> 25:59.391
<i>-Why do you ask?</i>
-Nothing.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.434
I wanted to ask her something,
but I can't reach her.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.895
I know where she lives.
Should I go there?

26:03.979 --> 26:07.440
No, you don't have to.
Don't go.

26:08.650 --> 26:09.568
Okay.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.655
She could get into trouble, too.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.039
I would like to report.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.332
Was it Woo-young?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.211
Yes. He asked if I had seen Sua today.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.922
He wants to ask her something.

26:32.716 --> 26:33.925
<i>Kyung-seok!</i>

26:34.384 --> 26:36.344
Is anyone at school following Sua?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.974
No, never mind.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.228
Do you know where Sua lives?

26:45.895 --> 26:46.730
I do.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.488
What did I do?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.576
I thought I was the only one
who liked you.

27:00.076 --> 27:03.330
I need a normal weight to look pretty.
I have the body of a little kid.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.750
You must be kidding.
You never had a boyfriend?

27:14.674 --> 27:16.384
Are you okay?

27:17.594 --> 27:19.387
So, I wanted to give up.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.723
But you liked me, too.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.477
You said hi to me first.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.228
You smiled at me!

27:28.521 --> 27:29.356
I did?

27:33.485 --> 27:34.778
Hi, Dong-won!

27:37.238 --> 27:39.240
You two have the same name!

27:39.699 --> 27:41.368
His name is Dong-won, too.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.915
You even named the cat after me.
Who would ever give that name to a cat?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.503
You did that on purpose
to get my attention.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.465
You liked the drink I gave you.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.385
You wanted to take a picture with me, too.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.929
FOR SUA

28:02.305 --> 28:03.973
Thank you for the drink.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.520
Do you want to take a picture like that?

28:08.603 --> 28:09.771
Why me?

28:10.897 --> 28:12.565
Take a picture of Dong-won, too!

28:13.191 --> 28:15.443
And you said you like Kyung-seok
in front of me?

28:18.822 --> 28:20.240
You looked down on me!

28:20.782 --> 28:22.909
You don't really like Kyung-seok, right?

28:22.992 --> 28:24.244
What are you talking about?

28:25.495 --> 28:26.621
What a loser.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.255
It was a misunderstanding!

28:38.800 --> 28:41.511
You had feelings for me!
You can't just change your mind.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.766
Please. Help me!

28:48.977 --> 28:50.228
You?

28:53.857 --> 28:54.691
No.

29:02.782 --> 29:03.825
You know what this is?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.339
What's the matter?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.592
I don't know.
I have a weird feeling about this.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.098
I hear her over there.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.025
Hey, isn't that Dong-won?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.160
Kyung-seok!

30:14.896 --> 30:16.064
What did you do?

30:17.232 --> 30:19.067
She didn't apologize.

30:19.734 --> 30:20.568
What?

30:37.836 --> 30:38.670
Sua!

30:42.173 --> 30:43.591
Are you okay?

30:44.175 --> 30:45.134
Are you okay?

30:45.218 --> 30:47.554
He sprayed something on me.

30:47.679 --> 30:48.513
What?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.307
-What did he spray?
-I don't know.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.685
He just sprayed something.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.651
It's nothing. You're okay.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.236
Don't look!

31:04.696 --> 31:05.947
I said don't look.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.075
Please, don't look.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.828
Take it easy.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.914
It's nothing, okay?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.959
It's just water. Look at me, Sua.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.836
I told you not to look!

31:25.216 --> 31:26.384
I'm going to kill myself.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.344
Sua!

31:32.140 --> 31:33.016
Put that down.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.147
Sua, look at me.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.357
Look!

31:42.567 --> 31:44.611
Here, Sua. Look!

31:45.612 --> 31:46.821
You're fine.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.657
Nothing happened.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.287
You are fine.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.123
Everything's okay.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.170
Put that down.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.303
Give that to me.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.646
Did he hurt you?

32:21.606 --> 32:22.982
Let's get up slowly.

32:24.567 --> 32:25.610
Let go!

32:30.031 --> 32:31.240
Why are you here?

32:32.325 --> 32:33.743
Why you?

32:34.494 --> 32:37.080
Why is someone like you helping me?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.541
Who asked you to help me?

32:40.625 --> 32:42.961
Why are you acting
like you're better than me?

32:44.671 --> 32:47.215
Why are you acting
like you're happier than me?

32:51.344 --> 32:53.471
You're not even pretty.

32:59.769 --> 33:03.022
Please. Stop now, please!

33:06.985 --> 33:08.403
You...

33:10.863 --> 33:12.657
I really don't like you.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.160
Do you know how much you frustrate me?
I feel like I'm talking to a wall.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.748
Fine. I am not pretty,
so I had plastic surgery.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.167
I was unhappy because I was ugly,
like you said.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.879
What about you?
Are you happy because you're pretty?

33:27.630 --> 33:29.132
Are you happy?

33:30.591 --> 33:32.760
Why does it have to be this way?

33:34.512 --> 33:37.098
Why do we have to be like this?

33:40.226 --> 33:42.687
We are on a diet
even though there's no weight to lose.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.982
We throw up and have surgeries...

33:47.859 --> 33:50.319
as if we'd die if we didn't get pretty.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.993
We judge faces...

34:00.830 --> 34:02.582
and fight with each other.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.051
Why do we have to do that?

34:16.929 --> 34:21.391
I... really don't want to.

34:22.976 --> 34:25.730
I don't want to do that any more.

34:26.981 --> 34:27.982
I...

34:28.649 --> 34:30.193
From now on,

34:31.152 --> 34:37.033
I will concentrate
on what makes me really happy.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.415
That's what I'm gonna do.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.726
Yes, Sua is fine.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.271
She was scared, but didn't get hurt.

35:08.815 --> 35:11.859
Yes, she is sleeping now.
So don't worry.

35:13.027 --> 35:14.153
Of course.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.159
Are you okay?

35:22.495 --> 35:23.412
I am.

35:29.669 --> 35:30.586
Well...

35:33.506 --> 35:36.592
can I stay with Sua for a while?

35:44.475 --> 35:45.810
Don't you hate her?

35:47.854 --> 35:48.688
Hate?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.358
You hate her, too,

35:52.859 --> 35:54.277
and you still helped her.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.614
-That's...
-Is it okay if I stay?

36:00.283 --> 36:03.035
It's your decision. Do what you want.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.206
Thank you.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.047
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.146
What a psycho.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.481
What will happen to him?

36:33.357 --> 36:36.611
After the police investigation,
he will be kicked out of school.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.696
The legal process will remain to be seen.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.411
-Are you waiting for Mi-rae?
-No.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.330
I was waiting for you.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.582
I wanted to go home together.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.669
Why are you so friendly
all of sudden?

36:53.753 --> 36:55.296
It's not all of sudden.

36:55.796 --> 36:58.549
When you were drunk last time,
I brushed your teeth.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.344
What?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.138
-Let's go.
-Wait up!

37:04.722 --> 37:07.058
-What are you saying? When?
-When you came home drunk.

37:07.141 --> 37:08.559
You brushed my teeth?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.853
Yes. And I made you breakfast.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.232
Oh, that day!

37:14.690 --> 37:17.944
Now that I think of it,
I did everything...

37:19.320 --> 37:21.030
You didn't brush my teeth!

37:21.113 --> 37:22.073
I did.

37:22.865 --> 37:24.742
You sure are brave.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.118
I thought I was.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.668
Are you still here?

37:38.214 --> 37:39.590
I'll stay here.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.552
Okay, then.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.473
Call me if you need me.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.433
I will.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.122
Silly.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.544
You're even sillier than me.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.131
Let's stop...

38:22.300 --> 38:24.302
living like this.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.585
What picture was posted online?

39:40.044 --> 39:40.920
I didn't see it.

39:41.003 --> 39:45.257
It was just the back of a woman.
You can't even be sure it was Sua.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.512
The face also was online for a short time.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.516
Her phone is off.
And she's not picking up.

39:54.558 --> 39:57.645
I thought we were close,
but she's not calling me.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.356
You were close
and you spoke behind her back?

40:00.439 --> 40:02.733
I'm not the one who spread the rumors.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.445
Everyone knew she was throwing up
and dating all the boys.

40:07.905 --> 40:11.075
Anyway, people have
a bad impression of her now.

40:11.909 --> 40:15.162
-She's not even from a wealthy family.
-Who said that?

40:17.081 --> 40:18.290
Dong-won.

40:18.374 --> 40:22.795
When we were in the lab,
he said everything about Sua is fake.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.256
How would he know?

40:26.006 --> 40:27.550
Isn't he a little strange?

40:27.633 --> 40:30.010
Look! You always say bad things
about people.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.346
-Just eat.
-Why?

40:32.596 --> 40:35.808
He is weird. He never makes eye contact.

40:37.351 --> 40:41.480
I hope he stays in prison forever.

40:41.772 --> 40:45.025
I understand you feel nervous,
but don't worry too much.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.736
He will be issued a restraining order
when he gets out.

40:48.404 --> 40:52.533
And you will be fine
with counseling and treatment.

40:55.244 --> 41:00.291
I don't know
why I have to go through this.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.668
I don't think...

41:04.003 --> 41:06.213
I can go anywhere alone.

41:06.297 --> 41:10.301
Do you have anyone you can count on?

41:11.427 --> 41:13.721
Someone who can be with you for a while.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.475
I thought I had someone.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.146
But I don't have anyone.

41:23.105 --> 41:25.024
COUNSELING ROOM 2

41:27.318 --> 41:29.320
Okay. I got it.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.405
I see. All right.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.161
Sua!

41:41.165 --> 41:44.251
Why, didn't you think I'd be waiting?

41:48.672 --> 41:52.968
I'd like to be with you for a while,
if it's okay with you.

42:02.645 --> 42:03.646
There.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.400
The cakes in that bakery are good.
Let's go and eat some next time.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.448
No one knows what happened.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.117
Really.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.664
Everyone knows how to hold their tongues.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.750
Woo-young, Kyung-seok, Mi-rae.

42:28.712 --> 42:29.922
And you.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.845
I've tried...

42:39.431 --> 42:41.016
but I have to say something.

42:43.477 --> 42:47.856
Mi-rae liked you at first.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.902
You told her you two were friends.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.697
She said that made her happy.

43:08.836 --> 43:09.837
Thank you.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.339
Of course. Don't worry.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.972
The cat knows you.

43:20.055 --> 43:22.808
Yes. Sometimes I feed him.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.560
He likes my food.

43:27.396 --> 43:28.772
You like cats.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.443
Yes, I do.

43:39.658 --> 43:41.619
<i>Kyung-seok and Mi-are are dating.</i>

43:42.161 --> 43:43.871
<i>-Since when?</i>
<i>-Since the break.</i>

43:44.246 --> 43:47.541
-They began dating at Kelun Korea.
-Wow!

43:47.666 --> 43:50.419
I should have applied for Kelun.

43:50.544 --> 43:52.546
If you had,
would you be able to date Kyung-seok?

43:54.048 --> 43:55.924
Mi-rae is so lucky.

43:56.008 --> 43:59.845
She must have saved the country
in her previous life. I am so jealous.

44:00.346 --> 44:03.057
-I should have...
-I know.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.226
Everyone scream!

44:09.313 --> 44:10.981
A campus couple is born.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.275
-What are you two?
-Are you guys really together?

44:17.112 --> 44:19.365
Yes, we are together.

44:22.368 --> 44:23.994
Kyung-seok smiled.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.887
Don't kiss during class.

44:45.974 --> 44:48.310
Okay. Not in class.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.938
After class, then?

44:57.444 --> 44:59.613
You don't have to answer everything.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.699
You said I should be nice to people.

45:09.873 --> 45:12.543
Next year, I'd like to apply
for the exchange student program.

45:12.626 --> 45:13.877
Is your GPA over 3.5?

45:14.420 --> 45:19.007
Do you also have the prejudice
that pretty girls get bad grades?

45:20.134 --> 45:22.469
I thought you were different.
I'm disappointed.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.639
I don't think you're that pretty.

45:25.723 --> 45:26.890
I just asked.

45:27.933 --> 45:29.059
What's for lunch today?

45:29.143 --> 45:31.061
You're curious about that
on the first day of the semester?

45:32.354 --> 45:34.523
You're all curious, right?
You're just not saying it.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.151
Now that I think about it, it's true.

45:37.234 --> 45:40.571
I thought about it, but I didn't say
anything because I knew you would.

45:40.654 --> 45:41.989
I knew it!

45:43.699 --> 45:46.243
Am I the only one who has a problem
understanding this conversation?

46:02.009 --> 46:02.843
Sorry.

46:04.303 --> 46:05.179
About what?

46:05.763 --> 46:08.766
I hurt your feelings.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.852
It's okay. It's all in the past.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.230
You can't make yourself
feel a certain way.

46:16.607 --> 46:17.483
I know.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.861
I can't control how I feel.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.115
I can't stop thinking about you.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.079
Really?

46:32.372 --> 46:35.709
That is so sad.
I don't really think about you.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.131
There are people who are fine as a friend.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.718
But they're just okay as a boyfriend.

46:46.678 --> 46:47.846
You're one of them.

46:50.849 --> 46:52.810
So, I got over it quickly.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.688
Don't feel too bad. I gotta go.

47:04.822 --> 47:05.697
Woo-young!

47:08.408 --> 47:10.828
Do you have a minute?

47:12.287 --> 47:14.414
None of the seniors are available.

47:15.040 --> 47:18.794
So, they want me
to be the president for a while.

47:20.712 --> 47:22.673
Silly Tae-young.

47:22.923 --> 47:25.092
If he doesn't want to do it,
there's nothing we can do.

47:25.175 --> 47:27.344
Behave until the election.
Don't get in trouble.

47:27.970 --> 47:30.556
Okay. By the way...

47:36.144 --> 47:38.981
do you know her? She's the prettiest girl
in the Dance Department.

47:40.232 --> 47:42.818
-No
-Really? She is very famous.

47:44.695 --> 47:46.822
I don't know her. Why?

47:47.823 --> 47:50.325
She asked to be introduced to you.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.829
She saw you in a science class.
You will meet her, right?

47:55.789 --> 47:57.332
-No.
-Why?

47:58.458 --> 48:01.211
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-No, that's not it.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.381
I want love at first sight.

48:04.923 --> 48:06.174
Tell her I am sorry.

48:10.304 --> 48:13.056
She's not a model, but she's very pretty.

48:16.935 --> 48:19.438
Oh, he's the pine tree of the school.

48:19.646 --> 48:21.648
Never changes.

48:23.275 --> 48:24.484
Who is she?

48:24.568 --> 48:25.777
You scared me.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.738
Who is she?
If Woo-young won't meet her, I will.

48:29.239 --> 48:31.116
-Don't talk to me.
-Hey, hey!

48:32.242 --> 48:35.162
Let's get along, huh?

48:37.789 --> 48:39.499
This is not my year.

48:42.502 --> 48:43.462
Hyun-jung!

48:46.131 --> 48:47.049
Hyun-jung!

48:49.134 --> 48:51.929
<i>-</i>Are you going home?
-Hi!

48:53.597 --> 48:54.765
What's wrong?

48:55.390 --> 48:57.434
Will you buy me a drink?

48:59.311 --> 49:00.562
Okay, sure.

49:13.200 --> 49:16.995
He said "friend",
so I expected someone in his 20s.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.790
He was 33! Oh, my God.

49:20.874 --> 49:23.293
If we met and fell in love,
that's a different story.

49:23.418 --> 49:27.464
How can a 33-year-old man
want to meet a college freshman?

49:27.881 --> 49:29.174
Is he some kind of weirdo?

49:29.257 --> 49:31.885
It was wrong.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.721
He should have told you his age
in advance.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.890
I don't expect much.

49:37.391 --> 49:40.560
I just want an ordinary boyfriend
and ordinary love.

49:40.686 --> 49:42.354
How can everything go so wrong?

49:44.231 --> 49:47.609
There is no ordinary love.
Every relationship is special.

49:51.321 --> 49:53.657
I'm curious to see who you will meet.

49:55.450 --> 49:56.952
I also don't know.

50:06.253 --> 50:10.257
How do you change an exponential function
to a log function?

50:11.008 --> 50:12.592
Where did you have the surgery?

50:13.844 --> 50:16.930
This is study hall. Let's focus.

50:17.597 --> 50:19.516
If you change to a log function,

50:20.350 --> 50:22.019
this is how it should be.

50:22.894 --> 50:26.440
Did you do it all at once?
Or one at a time?

50:28.608 --> 50:31.069
Can you not concentrate
because of my face?

50:31.153 --> 50:35.490
No, of all the tutors I had,
you're the best one.

50:36.742 --> 50:39.703
Really? Then let's do it again.

50:39.786 --> 50:44.875
And you switch X and Y here...

50:45.917 --> 50:46.918
and this is how it goes.

50:47.669 --> 50:51.381
-How much did it cost?
-Look here!

50:51.465 --> 50:54.092
I'm explaining an important concept.

50:54.593 --> 50:55.427
Okay.

50:55.510 --> 50:58.055
-Do you remember symmetric transformation?
-By the way...

50:58.138 --> 50:59.181
Now what?

50:59.973 --> 51:02.392
-...can I go to the bathroom?
-What?

51:04.728 --> 51:05.937
Okay. Go ahead.

51:13.653 --> 51:15.363
Be patient.

51:16.364 --> 51:19.284
You need money
to buy Kyung-seok's birthday present.

51:22.996 --> 51:27.125
-Your brother is so handsome.
-Really?

51:30.087 --> 51:32.506
What do you want to eat?
I will pay.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.674
-Order whatever you want.
-Wow!

51:34.966 --> 51:36.176
Is your brother real?

51:37.427 --> 51:38.261
And...

51:39.846 --> 51:41.014
what is that?

51:43.558 --> 51:44.476
My ID.

51:44.935 --> 51:47.187
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND

51:52.818 --> 51:55.403
<i>-I'm here.</i>
<i>-Just a minute.</i>

51:56.655 --> 51:58.907
<i>Take your time. I will wait.</i>

52:01.576 --> 52:02.828
KYUNG-SEOK
CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT

52:02.911 --> 52:05.163
-Isn't it inconsiderate?
-Oh, my! You scared me.

52:07.457 --> 52:09.835
-What?
-Am I just your classmate?

52:12.712 --> 52:17.509
I wanted to change it, but I did not know
what I should change it to.

52:19.344 --> 52:20.887
How did you save my name?

52:22.597 --> 52:23.473
I don't know.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.768
What's the matter?

52:28.228 --> 52:29.604
Kang Mi-rae, chemistry department.

52:34.234 --> 52:35.277
Are you upset?

52:37.028 --> 52:39.114
Okay. I will change it.

52:40.073 --> 52:42.159
What should we do Saturday?
Do you have any plans?

52:44.744 --> 52:47.414
If not, do you want to go somewhere?

52:52.502 --> 52:53.336
Okay.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.715
Saturday is your birthday!

52:57.465 --> 52:59.759
-Are you 33 years old?
-No.

53:00.969 --> 53:04.139
You will spend the day with Mi-rae.
Come by for a while.

53:04.723 --> 53:05.974
<i>I'll buy you a drink.</i>

53:09.853 --> 53:12.981
When do girls get tired
of their boyfriends?

53:13.064 --> 53:13.940
What?

53:15.442 --> 53:18.570
What are you talking about?
Are things getting cold with Mi-rae?

53:19.321 --> 53:20.197
No.

53:22.741 --> 53:24.075
I'll call you later.

53:25.785 --> 53:26.620
Okay.

53:29.039 --> 53:29.956
Hey!

53:36.296 --> 53:38.632
-You put on the cologne I gave you.
-Yes.

53:39.090 --> 53:40.550
Just a little.
I don't want to use it all up .

53:41.134 --> 53:43.220
I'll buy you more if you run out.

53:44.054 --> 53:45.347
When is your birthday?

53:45.430 --> 53:48.850
Mine? September 25th.

53:49.726 --> 53:52.020
-I was born in September, too.
-Really?

53:52.103 --> 53:56.983
I was born on the 15th. So, I am older.

53:59.986 --> 54:01.947
Okay. I'll call you big guy.

54:05.867 --> 54:07.244
Maybe she forgot.

54:08.828 --> 54:11.331
You can't just work
part-time jobs forever.

54:11.414 --> 54:15.877
Stop rejecting your dad's business.
You can quit if you don't like it there.

54:16.044 --> 54:17.629
You haven't even given it a try.

54:20.674 --> 54:23.093
Do you want to go
to my dad's business place with me?

54:26.554 --> 54:28.515
Can anyone go there?

54:29.432 --> 54:32.477
Yes, everyone's welcome there.

54:36.189 --> 54:39.025
Why did you want to come to a church?

54:40.402 --> 54:41.236
Dad!

54:43.029 --> 54:44.281
Yoo-jin!

54:50.537 --> 54:53.206
-Who is this?
-She is a junior at my school.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.836
Hello. I am Choi Jung-boon
of the chemistry department.

54:57.919 --> 55:02.048
Chemistry?
Isn't that Kyung-seok's department, too?

55:02.132 --> 55:03.508
-Yes.
-Yes.

55:07.387 --> 55:09.139
You said business.

55:10.098 --> 55:13.601
You must have a lot to think about.
You like drinking so much.

55:13.685 --> 55:17.731
That's just the first problem.

55:20.775 --> 55:23.403
I feel sorry for you and the kids.

55:24.404 --> 55:25.655
There's a lot I regret.

55:28.533 --> 55:33.330
If I said for us to eat together tomorrow
to celebrate Kyung-seok's birthday...

55:37.334 --> 55:39.085
that would be too much to ask, right?

55:40.086 --> 55:42.756
-Is that what you wanted to say?
-No.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.510
I want you to know one thing.

55:48.803 --> 55:51.598
I only loved two women in my life.

55:52.932 --> 55:57.062
Hye-sung at 26 and Hye-sung at 46.

56:04.027 --> 56:06.196
-I am 47.
-What?

56:08.448 --> 56:09.282
Oh.

56:14.079 --> 56:15.080
Just...

56:26.716 --> 56:29.386
-Hey, brother!
-You...

56:29.469 --> 56:31.763
I was fired,
you're not my boss any more.

56:33.431 --> 56:35.517
Yes, you are right.

56:38.686 --> 56:41.815
I'm sorry for blaming you
for Kyung-hee's problem.

56:41.898 --> 56:45.485
Oh, no. It's all good.
I got a better job now.

56:46.861 --> 56:49.572
I will tell my boss Kim,
head of the party,

56:49.656 --> 56:52.951
to take good care of you, brother.

56:59.666 --> 57:00.625
Take care.

57:27.694 --> 57:30.822
It's not her.

57:38.371 --> 57:41.624
Did I sleep through class?

57:44.419 --> 57:45.295
Mi-rae!

57:47.005 --> 57:48.131
We're you asleep?

57:49.174 --> 57:51.843
-I think so.
-You didn't answer the phone.

57:53.219 --> 57:55.847
I think I passed out.

57:59.642 --> 58:00.935
What's this?

58:01.895 --> 58:04.230
What? What is it?

58:04.439 --> 58:06.441
Someone must've put it there
while you were asleep.

58:07.650 --> 58:11.696
-What are you saying? It was you!
-No, it wasn't me.

58:11.779 --> 58:13.781
You're trying to fool me.

58:15.033 --> 58:16.117
It wasn't me.

58:22.123 --> 58:24.125
It really wasn't you?

58:26.836 --> 58:30.715
Someone else must know you well enough
to give you perfume.

58:34.928 --> 58:36.763
I gotta go. I have a class.

58:37.222 --> 58:40.725
-Call me when you're done.
-I have to go to work.

58:44.395 --> 58:46.022
What is this?

58:46.648 --> 58:48.358
Who put it here?

58:52.320 --> 58:55.073
Tomorrow is Kyung-seok's birthday!

59:11.464 --> 59:12.507
It's been a while.

59:16.052 --> 59:17.762
How did you find me here?

59:19.514 --> 59:21.933
Your picture is everywhere on SNS.

59:22.725 --> 59:23.810
You're famous.

59:27.272 --> 59:30.316
Now, I use the internet
and see stuff like that.

59:30.900 --> 59:32.151
Do you feel okay?

59:34.696 --> 59:36.781
It's weird that you worry about me.

59:39.993 --> 59:41.327
I took some time off of school.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.080
I don't know when I'll be back.

59:45.248 --> 59:47.458
And I don't think
we'll see each other again.

59:47.542 --> 59:48.918
Do you have something to say?

59:50.128 --> 59:50.962
Yes.

59:52.755 --> 59:55.174
I need to tell you the truth.

59:56.467 --> 1:00:00.930
I never liked you,
not even for a second.

1:00:08.938 --> 1:00:09.772
I will go now.

1:00:13.651 --> 1:00:16.487
Are you wearing perfume?

1:00:17.113 --> 1:00:17.947
Yes.

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:24.954
I tried something new.
Everything else became easy.

1:01:14.712 --> 1:01:18.966
What can I do
if someone I don't know left it there?

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:22.136
-Is it my fault?
-Did I say anything?

1:01:22.512 --> 1:01:24.681
What can I do? My girlfriend is popular!

1:01:24.764 --> 1:01:27.141
I changed your name in my contact list.

1:01:27.767 --> 1:01:28.685
Look!

1:01:31.354 --> 1:01:33.189
♥KYUNG-SEOK♥

1:01:37.735 --> 1:01:40.988
Is that good? Do you feel better?

1:01:41.531 --> 1:01:43.157
Yes. Okay.

1:01:45.368 --> 1:01:46.661
Where are we going?

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:50.665
The weather's nice. Let's go far away!

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:53.042
-Far away?
-Yes.

1:02:00.174 --> 1:02:01.134
Two people?

1:02:01.676 --> 1:02:04.345
Yes, I made a reservation
under the name Do Kyung-seok.

1:02:04.846 --> 1:02:06.347
Yes, please follow me.

1:02:14.856 --> 1:02:15.940
Sit down, please.

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:26.075
You...

1:02:27.201 --> 1:02:28.453
You thought I forgot?

1:02:42.592 --> 1:02:45.094
No! Don't you dare.

1:02:48.556 --> 1:02:49.432
Don't.

1:02:49.515 --> 1:02:53.561
Yes, I will.
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1:02:53.644 --> 1:02:59.400
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>
<i>Happy birthday, Kyung-seok!</i>

1:03:01.986 --> 1:03:05.072
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1:03:08.159 --> 1:03:08.993
Blow.

1:03:13.247 --> 1:03:14.624
Happy birthday!

1:03:22.632 --> 1:03:23.758
Here's my present.

1:03:25.802 --> 1:03:30.556
-So, you pretended you didn't remember?
-I really wanted to surprise you.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.308
You want to do a lot of things.

1:03:34.310 --> 1:03:35.561
Thank you.

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:39.357
Open it.

1:03:50.159 --> 1:03:52.453
-Do you like it?
-I don't...

1:03:57.875 --> 1:03:58.709
I like it.

1:04:00.545 --> 1:04:02.964
I have one more thing.

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:07.552
Ta-da!

1:04:19.105 --> 1:04:21.607
One, two, three!

1:04:31.158 --> 1:04:33.911
Actually, a long time ago,

1:04:34.328 --> 1:04:38.374
I used to judge people's faces
when they walked by.

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:43.796
But at some point, I stopped.

1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:50.511
I am conscious of other people,
so I figured they would do the same.

1:04:54.181 --> 1:04:57.476
But not many people pay attention to me.

1:05:06.235 --> 1:05:08.571
This would be a nice place to propose.

1:05:09.614 --> 1:05:10.448
What?

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:16.329
Places like cafes go away
as time goes by.

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:19.498
But this place will always be here.

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:29.050
Looking at my parents,
I thought I would never marry.

1:05:43.272 --> 1:05:49.278
The hoodie I gave you,
I bought one for myself, too.

1:06:18.599 --> 1:06:20.810
Hey, Do-rae couple!

1:06:21.227 --> 1:06:23.229
You guys should buy lunch!

1:06:27.733 --> 1:06:32.196
<i>Let's leave in matching hoodies</i>

1:06:32.488 --> 1:06:34.490
Are you guys on your honeymoon?

1:06:38.536 --> 1:06:40.705
Should I not have bought mine?

1:06:40.788 --> 1:06:44.125
Who cares? Do whatever you want!
