01:02.825 --> 01:03.905
Fire!

01:10.188 --> 01:11.228
Let s go!

01:19.311 --> 01:20.711
Forward!

01:21.792 --> 01:23.352
Forward!

01:41.120 --> 01:43.921
- Cease firing.
- Cease firing.

01:44.361 --> 01:46.121
We did it!
We beat them!

01:46.762 --> 01:48.602
What if they come back?

01:49.283 --> 01:51.563
We’ve used
over half our ammunition.

01:52.244 --> 01:54.084
Are you good
with a slingshot?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.650
A friend of yours?

02:25.938 --> 02:26.858
Soldier.

02:27.178 --> 02:30.619
- Can you open the door?
- You cant go through, ma'am.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.183
That was bad luck.

02:41.824 --> 02:44.465
- I’ll be all right.
- I’ll be right back.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.872
- What do you make of her?
- This is quite a weapon.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.512
What would you call it?

03:03.953 --> 03:07.034
Across between
an alligator and an ostrich.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.915
We call her Betsy
after the Empress.

03:10.116 --> 03:13.117
It s an old German barrel
with Russian shells

03:13.357 --> 03:15.797
of approximately
the same caliber.

03:16.038 --> 03:18.759
The carriage is Italian,
the wheels French,

03:18.959 --> 03:21.760
and that boy's
fool enough to fire it.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.761
Would it be safer
in front or in back?

03:25.362 --> 03:28.483
The point is where is
Betsy going to be fired?

03:28.723 --> 03:31.444
-Major...
- Please, gentlemen.

03:33.245 --> 03:34.965
- Captain Marshall...
- What's up?

03:35.206 --> 03:37.366
The Chinese
are on top of the wall.

03:37.687 --> 03:40.728
- Now we know where Betsy goes.
- You! Over here!

03:41.848 --> 03:44.128
Come on, bring it along.

03:57.014 --> 03:57.854
Run!

03:59.215 --> 04:00.615
Cone on, Andy, run!

04:01.256 --> 04:03.056
Sergeant, get in.
Take cover.

04:08.459 --> 04:09.299
Damn it!

04:10.740 --> 04:11.940
What happened?

04:12.941 --> 04:16.022
We tried but they re too many.
They keep coming.

04:16.262 --> 04:17.142
Major.

04:40.472 --> 04:43.393
- How many did we lose?
- Turner and Spencer.

04:43.633 --> 04:46.634
5 wounded.
The Germans got it even worse.

04:52.236 --> 04:54.476
Why don’t they
rush us right now?

04:55.638 --> 04:57.438
We wouldn’t stand a chance.

04:58.159 --> 05:01.120
Maybe they think
We’ve got millions of men.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.680
Come morning
they'll think different.

05:04.841 --> 05:08.322
They’ll roll down
those ramps like Niagara Falls.

05:09.283 --> 05:11.203
We must get them
off this wall...

05:11.564 --> 05:12.524
We can t.

05:15.406 --> 05:17.886
Or They’ll shoot
into the Legation area.

05:18.127 --> 05:20.047
Like fish in a barrel.

05:20.288 --> 05:23.649
We might just as well
open the gates and let them in.

05:24.049 --> 05:26.289
Take the French priest
to the Legation.

05:26.530 --> 05:27.410
Right.

05:32.653 --> 05:33.973
They wont start

05:34.173 --> 05:35.493
up here till morning.

05:37.575 --> 05:39.255
Just hope they don’t.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.750
- No sign of activity?
- No, sir.

06:18.991 --> 06:20.191
They're all asleep.

06:21.832 --> 06:23.992
Well, we'd better not be.

06:24.473 --> 06:26.913
- Better wake them all up.
- Yes, sir.

06:30.236 --> 06:31.156
Wake up.

06:33.117 --> 06:34.157
Good morning.

06:36.398 --> 06:37.998
Good morning.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Good morning.

06:45.562 --> 06:46.482
Good morning.

06:46.962 --> 06:47.842
Good morning.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.804
Here they come!

08:32.083 --> 08:33.764
Keep rolling!
Keep rolling!

09:17.903 --> 09:19.463
Andy, get down.

09:29.827 --> 09:32.388
Major, what
are we doing here?

09:32.589 --> 09:35.069
- Why didn’t we get out?
- I don’t know.

09:36.590 --> 09:37.990
I really don’t know.

09:43.633 --> 09:46.033
Handley told me
you re-took the wall.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.395
I suppose you heard...
He died too.

09:51.516 --> 09:53.356
The Minister
can tell us why.

09:53.597 --> 09:56.678
And Marshall, too.
He has all the answers.

09:57.078 --> 09:58.318
That s all, sergeant.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.759
Get on back.

10:06.002 --> 10:07.402
He s a good soldier.

10:07.603 --> 10:09.403
When he knows
why he’s fighting.

10:09.763 --> 10:11.883
When it s
something you can see...

10:12.124 --> 10:14.204
a wall, a hill,
a river, it s easier.

10:14.685 --> 10:17.886
But how can you explain
it s for a principle?

10:20.568 --> 10:21.648
You cant.

10:23.489 --> 10:24.809
Not here in China.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.210
It s too far from home.

10:28.811 --> 10:29.691
I know.

10:41.416 --> 10:42.456
I wont stay.

10:43.137 --> 10:43.937
No!

10:44.977 --> 10:45.897
I won t stay!

10:46.338 --> 10:47.218
Don’t let...

10:48.259 --> 10:49.939
Don’t let them take my leg.

10:50.740 --> 10:51.660
Tell them...

10:52.020 --> 10:53.180
Tell them not to...

10:54.421 --> 10:55.501
Please!

10:55.982 --> 10:56.702
Please!

10:57.102 --> 10:59.663
- Tell them!
- There, there.

10:59.903 --> 11:02.624
I don’t want
to live like half a man.

11:09.987 --> 11:11.147
He s only fainted.

11:18.191 --> 11:19.311
You can go now.

11:19.871 --> 11:20.911
Can you save his leg?

11:27.515 --> 11:28.835
May I stay with him?

11:30.836 --> 11:34.317
Your dress is
a breeding-ground for germs.

11:37.679 --> 11:39.239
What re you waiting for?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.640
Take it off
and put on a uniform.

11:46.202 --> 11:47.402
Thank you, doctor.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.888
Who'll tell her?

12:05.610 --> 12:07.450
The captain s little girl.

12:15.454 --> 12:17.334
It s pretty late now.

12:18.695 --> 12:20.335
Tell her in the morning.

12:20.536 --> 12:23.617
But she might hear
about it from somebody else.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.738
I guess not.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.620
- Let s get a drink first.
- No, later.

12:40.664 --> 12:41.584
Coming?

12:44.425 --> 12:46.345
- I’m going back to the wall.
- Wait.

12:51.068 --> 12:52.028
All right.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.349
Where'll I find her?

12:56.270 --> 12:58.310
With the orphans in the Fu.

13:03.353 --> 13:04.433
How do I tell her?

13:06.314 --> 13:08.314
Like she was
your own, I guess.

13:09.795 --> 13:12.356
Like someone
telling your own kid.

13:28.763 --> 13:31.043
- Do you know which one she is?
- No.

13:31.284 --> 13:33.724
So many new children
came in today.

13:34.045 --> 13:35.365
Haven’t you met her?

13:36.006 --> 13:37.006
Just once.

13:37.727 --> 13:39.687
I cant remember
what she s like.

13:40.008 --> 13:41.568
I didn’t pay much attention.

13:42.729 --> 13:43.769
Major Lewis.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.890
We re looking for
the Marshall girl.

13:48.251 --> 13:51.332
Ah, of course.
Yes, Teresa... I heard.

13:54.773 --> 13:57.334
I guess she must
be sleeping, eh?

13:58.935 --> 14:00.815
Please tell her
in the morning.

14:01.096 --> 14:03.296
It s important
you tell her, Major.

14:03.617 --> 14:06.178
She knows you were
her father s friend.

14:07.018 --> 14:08.138
I'll wake her.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.621
Here she is.

14:14.861 --> 14:17.221
A friend of your father's
to see you.

14:20.144 --> 14:21.024
Teresa...

14:23.225 --> 14:24.105
You...

14:25.946 --> 14:28.587
- Do you remember me?
- Yes, Major.

14:29.707 --> 14:31.547
I have something to tell you.

14:33.069 --> 14:35.790
Why don’t the two of you
stay here and talk?

14:54.917 --> 14:57.237
You know
there s been some fighting?

15:02.080 --> 15:03.000
Well,

15:05.242 --> 15:07.122
I have something to tell you.

15:09.723 --> 15:11.123
Is it about my father?

15:13.765 --> 15:14.565
Yes.

15:20.528 --> 15:21.608
Is he... dead?

15:23.129 --> 15:24.169
Did you know?

15:32.252 --> 15:33.132
Well...

15:37.334 --> 15:38.734
you knew
he was a soldier.

15:39.295 --> 15:41.055
It could happen at any time.

15:46.698 --> 15:47.778
You’ll be taken care of.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.619
You won't have to worry.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.026
Well,

16:10.948 --> 16:12.708
You’ll be
all right now, huh?

16:15.270 --> 16:17.270
Wont I be going home then?

16:18.751 --> 16:19.671
Home?

16:24.753 --> 16:27.233
To America.
He said he d take me home.

16:32.957 --> 16:33.917
He did?

16:45.002 --> 16:45.922
When?

16:47.162 --> 16:48.242
Every time.

16:49.003 --> 16:50.203
And just today again.

17:09.531 --> 17:10.491
Well...

17:14.373 --> 17:16.093
I don't think
you d like it.

17:22.496 --> 17:23.816
Everything's

17:25.258 --> 17:26.578
very strange.

17:28.659 --> 17:31.139
Things are all different.
The people,

17:32.020 --> 17:35.541
and the food,
the houses, the schools.

17:42.424 --> 17:45.585
If you want, we can talk
some more in a few days,

17:47.106 --> 17:50.427
when things quiet down.

18:06.474 --> 18:07.514
I promise.

18:14.677 --> 18:15.677
All right.

18:24.481 --> 18:25.361
Bye.

18:39.607 --> 18:40.807
Think she understood?

18:44.329 --> 18:47.370
When a mother dies,
a child feels deserted.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.731
When a father goes away,

18:50.972 --> 18:52.612
a child feels abandoned.

18:53.573 --> 18:57.374
She s had more than her fair
share. She understands too well.

18:59.215 --> 19:01.415
What else
could I have told her?

19:03.497 --> 19:06.138
A child understands
only one language...

19:07.739 --> 19:08.739
love.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.821
Well, she isn’t mine.

19:16.382 --> 19:18.662
They say that
every man is the father

19:18.903 --> 19:20.703
of every child.

19:22.545 --> 19:24.105
I suppose
it's only true

19:25.146 --> 19:26.986
if you really feel it.

19:36.890 --> 19:39.250
The British Admiral
and his forces

19:39.491 --> 19:42.251
are trapped between
Langfang and Anping.

19:43.252 --> 19:46.412
The Boxers do not climb
a tree to look for a fish.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.973
They have done
their work well.

19:49.534 --> 19:51.974
The railway is destroyed.

19:52.975 --> 19:55.655
He can neither
proceed nor retreat.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.697
You see, the Boxers are not
as useless as you believed.

20:24.063 --> 20:26.503
It does not
require courage or skill

20:26.744 --> 20:28.984
to rip up
a few rails.

20:29.305 --> 20:31.025
The Boxers
flee the foreigners.

20:32.746 --> 20:35.066
If Sydney cannot
use the railway,

20:35.266 --> 20:37.106
he will now
march on Peking.

20:37.747 --> 20:39.667
I expect him
within the week.

20:40.748 --> 20:41.908
It is true.

20:42.148 --> 20:44.668
The Boxers cannot
stop such a force.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.990
Only General Jung-Lu's
Imperial troops can do that.

20:50.311 --> 20:52.631
They have no part
in this uprising.

20:53.512 --> 20:56.272
The troops will do
as Her Majesty commands.

20:56.873 --> 20:59.473
Who can make
muddy water clear?

21:01.154 --> 21:01.714
Your Majesty,

21:02.914 --> 21:04.594
first they said the Boxers

21:04.795 --> 21:07.515
would destroy
the foreigners in two days.

21:07.916 --> 21:11.757
Next that no foreign army
would even approach the city.

21:13.077 --> 21:16.557
If we commit the
Imperial Army against Sydney,

21:17.038 --> 21:20.078
we shall be declaring
waron all the Powers.

21:21.639 --> 21:24.119
Our armies,
for all their courage,

21:24.320 --> 21:26.440
could not
win such a war.

21:26.801 --> 21:29.001
The Boxers
have created an opportunity

21:29.202 --> 21:31.162
for a great
Chinese victory.

21:31.402 --> 21:33.562
If our troops
destroy their forces,

21:34.043 --> 21:37.003
it will prove that China
is no longer helpless,

21:37.284 --> 21:39.164
and be
the beginning of freedom.

21:40.205 --> 21:42.885
Each speaks with
the voice of a patriot.

21:43.686 --> 21:46.726
Prince Tuan counsels
a reckless adventure,

21:47.647 --> 21:50.807
General Jung-Lu counsels
prudence and patience.

21:53.368 --> 21:55.488
Prudence and patience for what?

21:56.769 --> 21:59.329
China's condition
can be no worse.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.890
Even if we start
a war and lose it,

22:02.171 --> 22:04.171
what more can
the powers take?

22:04.772 --> 22:05.972
General Jung-Lu,

22:06.772 --> 22:08.812
you will command our troops

22:09.773 --> 22:11.893
and turn back
the foreign armies.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.337
Stop it, Tommy.

22:27.018 --> 22:30.498
- You’ll wake the baby.
- You can t talk. You re dead.

22:40.662 --> 22:42.062
Don’t play
at that end.

22:44.023 --> 22:45.103
Oh, Tommy!

22:59.387 --> 23:00.227
Tommy!

23:03.428 --> 23:05.108
Mummy! Mummy!

23:39.798 --> 23:42.238
He’ll die
without going home.

23:43.679 --> 23:45.959
Funny how he used
to talk about home,

23:46.920 --> 23:48.960
as if he remembered
how it was.

23:49.801 --> 23:52.121
As if he’d
actually been there.

23:53.442 --> 23:54.402
Arthur.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.483
He used to ask me about it.

23:58.763 --> 24:01.003
He mustn't die. Poor Tommy.

24:01.564 --> 24:03.644
Yes, and poor us too.

24:04.325 --> 24:05.325
Arthur.

24:05.925 --> 24:08.685
I’ve the strangest feeling.

24:08.926 --> 24:09.966
What is it?

24:13.288 --> 24:16.488
Do you think if a child dies
without going home,

24:16.688 --> 24:18.168
that his soul
doesn’t rest?

24:20.570 --> 24:22.250
I think
it goes into limbo.

24:24.571 --> 24:27.491
An enormous,
empty Chinese limbo,

24:28.932 --> 24:30.932
wandering there,
lost and crying.

24:31.173 --> 24:33.293
- He’s fine.
- Why doesn’t he wake up?

24:33.533 --> 24:36.173
The doctor says
he s in a coma.

24:36.454 --> 24:38.334
It may last several days.

24:38.695 --> 24:40.735
He may not
come round at all...

24:41.055 --> 24:42.695
He may never
come round.

24:44.096 --> 24:45.536
Why? Why?

24:46.177 --> 24:48.417
How did he sin?
Against whom?

24:49.898 --> 24:52.138
What s he doing
in this foreign place?

24:54.219 --> 24:56.379
Whose ambition
is he serving?

24:58.340 --> 25:02.221
Must a child die
to serve the ends of ambition?

25:04.582 --> 25:06.182
Who d gain
from his death?

25:06.422 --> 25:07.942
Who'd be
the happier for it?

25:09.343 --> 25:11.343
How many children must die,

25:12.104 --> 25:15.184
how many people suffer,
before there is an end?

25:16.065 --> 25:18.705
A child s life
is too high a price to pay.

25:18.946 --> 25:20.746
I cant stand it!

25:21.347 --> 25:22.787
I cant stand it!

25:23.467 --> 25:27.108
- Sarah, try to understand
- Understand what? Tell me!

25:27.828 --> 25:29.428
- Tell me!
- I feel the pain too.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.990
Have you ever
been to England?

25:35.591 --> 25:36.391
Yes.

25:37.031 --> 25:38.151
Manchester?

25:40.472 --> 25:41.352
No.

25:42.352 --> 25:43.752
Is it a beautiful city?

25:46.914 --> 25:48.714
I wouldn’t
call it beautiful.

25:49.474 --> 25:50.234
But,

25:50.835 --> 25:53.715
you know how it is,
coming from a far place.

25:56.837 --> 25:57.997
Go to sleep now.

25:59.077 --> 26:02.437
Dream of Manchester.
It would be like a visit home.

26:06.319 --> 26:09.039
Litnoff is
the Tsarina s second cousin.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.720
You cannot treat him

26:11.961 --> 26:13.161
like a common soldier.

26:13.361 --> 26:14.161
The bullet

26:14.361 --> 26:16.881
wasn’t afraid
of wounding a Count.

26:17.322 --> 26:20.322
Germs wont care
if he s her first cousin.

26:21.043 --> 26:23.683
He’ll be treated
like any other man here.

26:24.964 --> 26:26.084
Good day, Baron.

26:33.087 --> 26:34.207
I understand

26:34.447 --> 26:36.767
you are here
early and late.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.928
A true angel of mercy.

26:43.209 --> 26:44.969
- The men won t be...
- Quiet!

26:45.730 --> 26:47.250
...nursed by anyone else.

26:51.052 --> 26:53.492
I've always
had a way with men.

26:53.932 --> 26:55.972
Even with
the German doctor.

26:56.453 --> 26:57.813
He can t do without me.

26:58.374 --> 26:59.494
And the Major?

27:00.974 --> 27:01.894
The American?

27:04.615 --> 27:05.575
What do you want?

27:10.857 --> 27:12.537
I d like to be present

27:12.818 --> 27:14.738
when he finds out
what you are.

27:15.579 --> 27:16.619
You’ll be present.

27:17.859 --> 27:21.139
You’ll tell him. You're
just waiting for the moment.

27:34.744 --> 27:35.984
Where is it?

27:36.464 --> 27:37.264
Right here.

28:09.874 --> 28:10.834
Open the door.

28:16.756 --> 28:20.276
Hello, Sir Arthur.
A message from Admiral Sydney.

28:20.477 --> 28:22.557
Welcome, Reverend Michaelson.

28:22.997 --> 28:24.397
Heavens.

28:25.118 --> 28:27.478
Where is it?
I hope I haven t lost it.

28:27.719 --> 28:31.360
- Where did you see the admiral?
- Here it is.

28:37.001 --> 28:39.641
We’ll have to decode it.
Come with me.

28:41.843 --> 28:45.484
With a column
of 2,200 men

28:45.724 --> 28:48.604
we came
by rail to Anping,

28:49.005 --> 28:50.725
where we were driven back

28:50.965 --> 28:54.485
by a large contingent
of Chinese Imperial forces.

28:57.247 --> 29:00.888
Our troops were decimated
and we lost a huge amount

29:01.128 --> 29:02.088
of equipment.

29:02.488 --> 29:04.768
'It is impossible
to march on Peking,

29:05.009 --> 29:07.609
so we must
fall back to Tientsin,'

29:07.850 --> 29:09.810
along the River Peigei.

29:10.651 --> 29:14.372
- 'Signed, Harold Sydney'.
- Is there nothing more?

29:14.612 --> 29:17.692
- What shall we do now?
- What shall we do?

29:35.658 --> 29:37.098
You've eaten nothing.

29:37.418 --> 29:40.298
- Have something now.
- Thank you, Sarah.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.420
Need more light?

29:44.100 --> 29:45.060
No, thank you.

29:46.501 --> 29:49.741
You asked me
why we were here.

29:50.382 --> 29:52.262
Why we hadn’t left.

29:52.743 --> 29:54.823
I’m sorry.
I shouldn’t have.

29:55.783 --> 29:58.383
Sometimes it s
good to wonder why.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.584
These last few hours
it s all I’ve done.

30:02.865 --> 30:03.905
What about?

30:06.867 --> 30:07.827
First,

30:08.147 --> 30:09.267
Who am I?'

30:10.508 --> 30:11.468
Second,

30:11.908 --> 30:14.948
What have I achieved
in 20 years of diplomacy?'

30:16.109 --> 30:17.069
Third,

30:17.550 --> 30:19.510
Am I a good diplomat,

30:20.190 --> 30:21.270
or a failure,

30:21.511 --> 30:24.591
only fit for
a minor post in Peking?

30:25.752 --> 30:26.712
Fourth,

30:27.392 --> 30:30.472
Have I honestly tried
to avoid war with China,'

30:31.793 --> 30:35.113
or have I only tried
to make a name for myself?

30:36.755 --> 30:37.675
Fifth,

30:38.315 --> 30:41.155
Am I a fool
in search of adventure,

30:42.036 --> 30:43.636
or a sensible man'

30:44.437 --> 30:46.317
who s taken a risk?

30:48.918 --> 30:50.558
What kind
of father am I

30:50.799 --> 30:53.079
to put my family s
lives in danger?

30:54.400 --> 30:55.560
Am I acting like

30:56.000 --> 30:59.400
some god playing
with the fate or others?

31:00.642 --> 31:03.762
I've been with you
since you started your career.

31:05.043 --> 31:07.163
I know what
You’ve been through

31:08.164 --> 31:09.604
and I know you well.

31:11.165 --> 31:13.645
Only an honourable man
says such things.

31:38.332 --> 31:40.772
- Excellency.
- I was just leaving, Major.

31:41.413 --> 31:43.773
We were talking
about the good times.

31:45.894 --> 31:47.014
Don’t go.

31:50.776 --> 31:52.616
My brother-in-law is eager

31:54.297 --> 31:55.577
to tell you something.

31:56.057 --> 31:58.737
This is a family matter.
Don’t discuss it

31:58.938 --> 32:01.178
- before strangers.
- Don’t play games.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.779
Get it over with now.

32:06.140 --> 32:09.460
We were talking about
my dead brother, her husband.

32:09.661 --> 32:10.981
I'm not interested.

32:12.022 --> 32:14.622
How do you suppose he was?
Like me?

32:14.822 --> 32:16.582
Fat, past middle age?

32:16.823 --> 32:17.743
Something like that.

32:19.224 --> 32:21.384
The youngest Colonel
in our army.

32:21.664 --> 32:23.304
With a brilliant future.

32:23.665 --> 32:26.025
The Tsar himself
had taken notice...

32:27.586 --> 32:29.226
Do you know
why he died?

32:30.427 --> 32:31.147
No.

32:34.428 --> 32:35.188
Go on.

32:36.148 --> 32:37.988
I cant...
It suddenly seems...

32:38.589 --> 32:41.069
He was drunk
and had an accident.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.311
Let s forget it.

32:48.312 --> 32:49.312
They said

32:50.792 --> 32:52.072
it was my fault.

33:10.718 --> 33:13.198
His family tried
to take away all I had.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.880
Don’t you believe me?

33:23.081 --> 33:25.961
I guess a man
gets what he deserves.

33:28.083 --> 33:30.443
What can I offer?
A soldier s pay?

33:31.564 --> 33:32.404
Yes.

33:33.044 --> 33:35.484
A soldier's pay
buys a soldiers woman.

33:52.210 --> 33:55.811
An urgent message
from Her Imperial Highness.

34:03.573 --> 34:04.533
'Therefore,

34:04.733 --> 34:08.172
in view of the aggression
of the armed forces'

34:08.373 --> 34:11.414
of Great Britain,
Germany, Russia, France,

34:11.614 --> 34:14.735
the United States,
Japan, Italy and Austria

34:14.976 --> 34:17.176
' under the command
of Admiral Sydney,

34:17.617 --> 34:20.737
the Imperial
Chinese Government demands

34:21.458 --> 34:22.737
the immediate

34:22.978 --> 34:24.418
and unconditional surrender

34:24.619 --> 34:27.498
of the armed forces
of these nations

34:27.739 --> 34:29.340
' and of all their weapons.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.940
We will
await your reply.

34:43.784 --> 34:45.543
I believe, Sir Arthur,

34:45.784 --> 34:48.425
that you are
the architect of our dilemma.

34:48.705 --> 34:49.784
What do you propose?

34:50.505 --> 34:53.505
I think you should all
know the military facts.

34:54.067 --> 34:57.027
We have had
almost 100 casualties,

34:57.268 --> 34:59.348
that is about 25%
of our forces.

35:00.269 --> 35:02.469
Over half
our ammunition is gone,

35:03.390 --> 35:06.270
food is low, medical
supplies are non-existent,

35:08.511 --> 35:11.951
and by a reasonable estimate
it will take 4 or 5 weeks

35:12.792 --> 35:16.553
to assemble forces on the coast
to fight through to Peking.

35:17.273 --> 35:18.393
What is your answer?

35:19.634 --> 35:22.314
We are all aware
of our own weakness.

35:23.315 --> 35:25.995
I’ve been thinking
about the Chinese.

35:26.596 --> 35:30.357
Prince Tuan persuaded
the Empress to commit her troops

35:30.557 --> 35:32.597
in the hope
of an easy victory.

35:32.798 --> 35:36.759
And he allowed Michaelson
through with Sydney's letter

35:37.119 --> 35:38.719
hoping we d collapse.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.680
The ultimatum
means he s promised

35:41.880 --> 35:43.640
our immediate surrender.

35:44.241 --> 35:44.961
Now,

35:45.521 --> 35:47.161
if instead of collapsing

35:47.602 --> 35:49.602
we show unexpected strength,

35:50.283 --> 35:51.763
and not only hold out

35:52.803 --> 35:54.363
but attack,
we may destroy

35:54.964 --> 35:56.444
Tuan s influence

35:56.644 --> 35:59.724
with the Empress
and force her to face reality.

36:00.285 --> 36:01.805
This is a man of faith.

36:02.046 --> 36:04.686
He thinks if we blow
our trumpets, the walls

36:04.887 --> 36:08.528
of Peking will collapse.
How many trumpets do we have,

36:08.768 --> 36:09.648
Major?

36:11.809 --> 36:13.369
I don’t know, Baron.

36:14.129 --> 36:17.489
But Sir Arthur has
a good idea about the Empress...

36:20.291 --> 36:22.611
About the Empress, understand

36:22.892 --> 36:25.012
there must be
no attempt on her life.

36:26.533 --> 36:28.773
I wouldn’t even
know where to start.

36:29.334 --> 36:30.614
I don’t want her killed.

36:33.215 --> 36:34.455
You don't want!

36:35.055 --> 36:36.535
It would mean chaos.

36:37.056 --> 36:40.016
Wed be fighting here
for the next 20 years.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.417
Do you have a better idea?

36:42.897 --> 36:46.818
I give you my word,
it would only enlarge the war.

36:49.579 --> 36:51.219
You re the diplomat.

36:51.820 --> 36:53.860
But let us
fight the battles.

36:55.301 --> 36:56.421
Come on, Colonel.

37:00.222 --> 37:02.222
- What do you think?
- Well...

37:03.743 --> 37:04.703
I’m thinking that

37:06.824 --> 37:08.344
if you re thinking

37:09.545 --> 37:11.225
what I think you re thinking,

37:12.066 --> 37:13.106
then...

37:15.867 --> 37:16.947
I’m afraid

37:17.387 --> 37:19.227
I must agree
with Sir Arthur.

37:32.071 --> 37:33.671
They re using
the big guns.

37:34.072 --> 37:36.272
The Empress
has committed her troops.

37:36.512 --> 37:39.072
Get everybody
into the compound.

37:39.553 --> 37:40.553
Here, take her.

37:45.395 --> 37:46.315
Arthur,

37:47.996 --> 37:49.836
Tommy s all right!

37:50.236 --> 37:52.156
He just woke up
and spoke to me.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.517
He s going to live!

37:54.918 --> 37:56.678
- He s going to live!
- Live?

38:40.570 --> 38:43.330
You wanted to avoid
a war and We’ve got one.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.611
You wanted
to wait for Sydney.

38:45.852 --> 38:47.252
Sydney isn’t coming.

38:47.572 --> 38:50.012
You say we should attack.
Attack whom?

38:50.253 --> 38:52.493
The Imperial Army?
And with what?

38:52.694 --> 38:54.694
With 115 rusty guns?

38:54.894 --> 38:56.854
I’ve heard
Tuan is preparing

38:57.095 --> 38:59.175
a victory celebration tonight

38:59.376 --> 39:01.136
in the Imperial Courtyard.

39:01.536 --> 39:03.096
I suppose
we're all invited?

39:03.857 --> 39:06.057
Rather than surrender, we must

39:06.298 --> 39:08.178
make Tuan lose face.

39:08.578 --> 39:10.418
We could
blow up the palace.

39:11.179 --> 39:14.820
The Chinese have an arsenal
near the Imperial City.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.340
- We could...
- I’ve heard of it.

39:17.581 --> 39:20.981
- Blow it up during their party.
- It's behind their lines.

39:21.462 --> 39:23.862
Then We’ll go
under their lines.

39:24.103 --> 39:25.743
- How?
- Look at your map.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.263
We could get to it
via the sewer

39:29.624 --> 39:32.584
and blow it up when
Tuan s telling the Empress

39:32.825 --> 39:34.265
we've been defeated.

39:34.465 --> 39:37.665
- It's through here.
- Getting back is another matter.

39:38.827 --> 39:39.787
We...

39:40.187 --> 39:43.067
You don’t need genius
to crawl up a sewer.

46:06.175 --> 46:07.335
We can t get away.

46:16.138 --> 46:17.778
We’ll be blown sky high.

46:21.739 --> 46:22.899
I’ve got to cut it.

47:37.121 --> 47:38.281
It s too short.

47:39.601 --> 47:41.441
If we light it
we won t get clear.

47:53.525 --> 47:55.765
Get those
two ends joined.

49:14.948 --> 49:17.348
I suppose you
have come to report

49:17.549 --> 49:20.149
the destruction
of the Legations,

49:20.630 --> 49:23.470
for the tenth time
since the last moon.

49:24.151 --> 49:27.591
I have come to ask
Your Majesty s permission

49:28.192 --> 49:29.912
to impeach
General Jung-Lu

49:30.152 --> 49:32.392
as a friend
to the barbarians.

49:32.873 --> 49:35.713
It s true he turned back
the foreign admiral,

49:35.954 --> 49:39.795
but he has guns the Boxers
need yet refuses to lend them,

49:40.115 --> 49:41.955
despite your commands.

49:42.196 --> 49:43.116
Be silent.

49:44.956 --> 49:46.196
General Jung-Lu.

49:48.397 --> 49:51.077
Despite the empty
promises of the Boxers,

49:51.798 --> 49:54.238
the foreign devils
grow stronger.

49:54.799 --> 49:57.399
Even the Forbidden City
is no longer safe.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.040
Underestimating the enemy
is a great calamity.

50:03.442 --> 50:06.202
You will speak
to the foreigners, Jung-Lu.

50:08.403 --> 50:10.963
Tell them peace
is a great blessing

50:11.724 --> 50:15.525
and that no calamity is greater
than lightly engaging in war.

50:44.973 --> 50:47.853
- Have they called off the war?
- Throw a line.

51:01.578 --> 51:03.138
Here, what have we got?

51:04.779 --> 51:08.339
A message for each
of the Ministers from Jung-Lu.

51:11.741 --> 51:13.021
They want a truce.

51:13.261 --> 51:15.581
We spoiled
the Empress s party.

51:15.782 --> 51:19.102
She s just as likely
to decide to finish us off.

51:19.303 --> 51:20.223
What does it say?

51:20.463 --> 51:24.184
'We are disturbed by the
arrival of troops at Tientsin'.

51:24.424 --> 51:25.384
Tientsin?

51:25.785 --> 51:29.506
Unless they are withdrawn,
I must consider it

51:29.746 --> 51:33.146
an act of war and will
commit the Imperial Forces. '

51:33.787 --> 51:36.067
Allied troops in Tientsin.

51:37.028 --> 51:40.428
- But they must think we re dead.
- Only 70 miles away.

51:40.669 --> 51:41.429
Yes.

51:42.269 --> 51:44.229
If we could
get word to them...

51:46.590 --> 51:49.310
You mean if I
could get word to them.

51:51.272 --> 51:52.152
Oh, no.

51:52.592 --> 51:54.392
Old soldiers never volunteer.

52:11.517 --> 52:12.557
Natalie.

52:20.560 --> 52:21.760
I’m going away.

52:24.041 --> 52:25.441
- When?
- Right now.

52:25.681 --> 52:26.561
I’m waiting,

52:26.762 --> 52:27.722
Baroness.

52:31.563 --> 52:34.083
- Where are you going?
- To get help.

52:34.684 --> 52:36.164
The patient is waiting!

52:36.484 --> 52:38.964
This is not
a reception hall.

52:43.486 --> 52:44.486
Will you come back?

52:46.087 --> 52:47.367
Sure, if I can.

52:48.608 --> 52:49.528
Natasha!

52:50.168 --> 52:51.088
Listen...

53:00.971 --> 53:02.051
What does he want?

53:02.292 --> 53:04.212
Do you think
people can change?

53:04.812 --> 53:07.972
That s something I can t
study under a microscope.

53:09.454 --> 53:12.534
- You look wonderful. You shaved.
- You noticed.

53:12.775 --> 53:14.655
Get me some
adhesive please.

53:29.699 --> 53:30.819
I’m going now.

53:33.020 --> 53:34.020
You said that.

53:36.301 --> 53:37.661
Yes, I know but...

53:44.944 --> 53:45.944
So long.

54:14.792 --> 54:15.872
Wait a minute.

54:22.354 --> 54:24.954
We never did
get a chance to talk?

54:28.476 --> 54:30.476
Look, I have
to go somewhere but...

54:31.237 --> 54:32.357
I’m coming back.

54:34.317 --> 54:35.597
Like my father.

54:37.558 --> 54:39.758
I’m coming back.
We'll talk then.

54:43.520 --> 54:44.480
All right?

54:52.042 --> 54:52.882
Come on.

54:59.284 --> 55:02.004
Where s that other
bottle of ether?

55:02.245 --> 55:04.845
- You say that every day.
- There was one.

55:05.046 --> 55:07.006
We used it over a week ago.

55:07.247 --> 55:10.327
- And the morphine?
- It s all gone. You know it.

55:11.128 --> 55:12.008
Well,

55:12.328 --> 55:15.168
We’ll have to operate
on the Italian regardless.

55:15.969 --> 55:18.249
He may faint
and feel nothing.

55:20.850 --> 55:21.730
lodine.

55:22.251 --> 55:23.251
Here.

55:24.611 --> 55:25.691
This is empty!

55:26.572 --> 55:27.612
I’m sorry.

55:28.092 --> 55:30.772
Don’t stand there.
Get me another bottle.

55:32.054 --> 55:33.534
This was the last bottle.

55:35.014 --> 55:38.094
No alcohol,
no iodine, amateur nurses...

55:39.616 --> 55:42.136
We re back
in the Dark Ages.

55:51.899 --> 55:53.939
No ether
for anesthetics,

55:54.820 --> 55:56.580
no morphine for pain.

55:57.861 --> 55:59.741
We are in
the land of opium

56:00.101 --> 56:02.061
and there are no opiates.

56:14.225 --> 56:14.905
Look out!

56:33.311 --> 56:35.431
Rogers, are you all right?

56:55.037 --> 56:57.397
Major, I’m hurt.
I'm hurt bad.

57:00.278 --> 57:01.278
I’ll get you back.

58:09.858 --> 58:12.738
Death s about and yet
your door is open.

58:14.179 --> 58:17.139
Open or closed it cannot
protect either of us.

58:18.780 --> 58:19.780
Old man...

58:20.421 --> 58:21.941
Life and death,

58:22.541 --> 58:24.101
are they important?

58:24.702 --> 58:25.742
Not to the gods.

58:27.023 --> 58:29.663
There are many men dying.
In pain.

58:30.263 --> 58:31.503
They need drugs.

58:31.944 --> 58:33.624
I do not deal in opiates.

58:33.864 --> 58:35.744
There are others who do.

58:36.105 --> 58:39.105
The Chinese outside
can only help you now.

58:41.827 --> 58:43.627
Even in war, old man,

58:45.388 --> 58:46.588
a valuable gift

58:46.828 --> 58:48.388
can work miracles.

58:54.590 --> 58:55.790
I want the drugs today.

58:57.871 --> 59:00.671
And a wagon full
of fruit for the children.

59:27.279 --> 59:29.319
Come on, Charlie. Rest here.

01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:11.331
Let s see
what s in here.

01:00:50.903 --> 01:00:52.463
All right, open it up!

01:01:05.587 --> 01:01:06.747
How did you do it?

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:40.636
To your positions.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:41.997
The truce is over!

01:03:13.663 --> 01:03:15.663
It s all right.
We made it.

01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:35.469
Get him to hospital.

01:03:46.752 --> 01:03:47.952
I didn’t make it.

01:04:41.807 --> 01:04:43.607
Major, I heard
you were back.

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:46.168
Off you go.

01:04:47.929 --> 01:04:48.809
Major,

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:49.690
Major,

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.010
wake up! Wake up!
The railroad...

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.011
tracks are much closer.

01:04:57.492 --> 01:04:58.332
Yes.

01:05:00.693 --> 01:05:03.253
- How close are they?
- Almost to the wall.

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:06.614
All right.

01:05:07.455 --> 01:05:08.695
Get me a shirt.

01:05:16.217 --> 01:05:18.257
- Did you hear about the Baroness?
- No.

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:19.738
She was shot.

01:05:21.739 --> 01:05:24.379
- What?
- She s in the hospital.

01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:30.141
Major, we d better hurry.

01:05:38.903 --> 01:05:39.943
Yes... Yes.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:01.550
Don’t...

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.150
Don’t take it
so hard, doctor.

01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:07.991
You must
let me try again.

01:06:09.272 --> 01:06:11.112
Soon it will be too late.

01:06:12.473 --> 01:06:14.313
You’ve done
all you can do.

01:06:15.914 --> 01:06:18.354
I must find
the focus of the infection.

01:06:21.635 --> 01:06:24.515
You wont find it
with a knife, doctor.

01:06:27.637 --> 01:06:29.397
Don’t you want to live?

01:06:32.318 --> 01:06:33.638
I...

01:06:34.839 --> 01:06:36.359
I have lived.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.600
Don’t think of anything

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:41.641
except living.

01:06:41.961 --> 01:06:43.401
Give yourself

01:06:44.202 --> 01:06:45.322
a chance.

01:06:47.723 --> 01:06:48.763
A chance?

01:06:50.524 --> 01:06:52.404
A chance for what?

01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:56.845
A chance to do
it all over again?

01:06:58.446 --> 01:07:00.766
No, thank you, doctor.

01:07:05.968 --> 01:07:09.809
If you die the light
will be gone from this place.

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:13.610
No.

01:07:16.971 --> 01:07:18.211
You're...

01:07:18.972 --> 01:07:21.652
the one who makes
all the light here.

01:07:26.654 --> 01:07:28.854
Forgive me
when I say that

01:07:31.575 --> 01:07:33.935
working with you
I’ve learned

01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:36.096
to care for You very much.

01:07:40.017 --> 01:07:42.537
I’m glad
you said that, Hans.

01:07:44.539 --> 01:07:47.259
A woman likes to hear it.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.660
Most men haven’t

01:07:53.101 --> 01:07:55.621
the courage to say it.

01:08:38.274 --> 01:08:40.754
They re closer
now than when I left.

01:08:40.953 --> 01:08:44.234
If it was for a gun,
they wouldn’t come so close.

01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:45.115
Yes.

01:08:47.276 --> 01:08:48.435
Get Father de Bearn.

01:08:48.676 --> 01:08:49.596
Yes, sir.

01:09:14.124 --> 01:09:15.484
What is it, Major?

01:09:15.724 --> 01:09:17.644
Ever seen
anything like that?

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.648
I certainly have not.

01:10:27.144 --> 01:10:29.104
You can t stop
that with rifles.

01:10:29.345 --> 01:10:31.065
But we have to stop it.

01:10:31.906 --> 01:10:34.066
Get me those urns
from the tower,

01:10:34.306 --> 01:10:36.906
coal oil and
some black powder

01:10:37.107 --> 01:10:39.227
and empty
champagne bottles too.

01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:54.351
Right now, put it
down here, not there.

01:10:55.312 --> 01:10:56.432
Pick up those bags.

01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:04.395
Where are those bottles
and the powder? Come on, hurry!

01:11:05.355 --> 01:11:06.235
That s it.

01:11:14.397 --> 01:11:17.117
With a little prayer
and a lot of luck...

01:11:29.242 --> 01:11:32.562
- Bad luck.
- You weren’t praying hard enough.

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:34.123
Give me that.

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:38.804
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:11:49.367 --> 01:11:51.967
- Come on.
- We'll pray harder, Father.

01:11:52.168 --> 01:11:52.928
Yes.

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.820
It must be terrible
to be a soldier.

01:12:40.301 --> 01:12:41.101
Yes...

01:12:43.302 --> 01:12:44.902
Sometimes it is.

01:13:08.269 --> 01:13:09.669
I was looking for you.

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:12.470
The Baroness is dead.

01:13:19.993 --> 01:13:21.593
Nothing to say?

01:13:26.794 --> 01:13:28.554
She didn’t mean
much to you.

01:13:29.195 --> 01:13:30.155
Shut up!

01:13:31.756 --> 01:13:34.116
- Sorry.
- Let me alone! Let me alone!

01:14:30.092 --> 01:14:31.972
I just heard.
I’m sorry.

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:35.974
Thank you.

01:14:44.976 --> 01:14:47.616
Well, we bought
ourselves another day.

01:14:48.297 --> 01:14:50.097
Still, it wasn’t
a bad fight.

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:54.699
What time is it?

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.780
5.37 a. m.

01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:03.701
August 14th, 1900.

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.902
How many days
did we hold out?

01:15:09.223 --> 01:15:10.863
Fifty-five.

01:16:59.894 --> 01:17:02.134
Those guns!
They re not Chinese!

01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:08.576
Strange!

01:17:50.508 --> 01:17:52.868
They re ours!
It s the relief forces!

01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:57.470
They re ours!

01:19:04.129 --> 01:19:05.169
They re ours!

01:19:05.889 --> 01:19:09.169
They re here!
They re here!

01:19:38.218 --> 01:19:40.738
They re ours!
They re ours!

01:21:11.605 --> 01:21:14.045
Water can support a ship.

01:21:25.248 --> 01:21:27.248
And water can upset it.

01:21:34.051 --> 01:21:36.051
The dynasty is finished.

01:22:29.907 --> 01:22:30.867
Listen.

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:33.507
They re playing
different tunes.

01:22:33.708 --> 01:22:37.028
Well, for 55 days
we played the same tune.

01:22:37.949 --> 01:22:40.629
Fifty-five days you
held us together.

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:42.630
You might
have started something

01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:45.230
that people
will remember some day.

01:22:45.471 --> 01:22:47.831
- We re ready.
- I’ll be right there.

01:22:51.313 --> 01:22:53.073
Will you stay in China?

01:22:53.833 --> 01:22:55.713
Oh, I go where
they send me.

01:22:56.714 --> 01:22:57.714
How about you?

01:22:58.234 --> 01:23:00.154
I’ll be going
home to England.

01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:02.755
Retired to private life,
I suppose.

01:23:03.076 --> 01:23:05.836
In the country with
a dog and a few books.

01:23:06.077 --> 01:23:07.997
An Englishman s dream, really.

01:23:09.158 --> 01:23:10.918
What s home for you?

01:23:11.838 --> 01:23:13.158
I don’t know.

01:23:13.959 --> 01:23:15.519
I may have
to make one.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.720
Good luck, Matt.

01:23:19.921 --> 01:23:20.841
Thanks.

01:23:49.369 --> 01:23:51.849
Right shoulder... arms!

01:24:18.937 --> 01:24:20.897
Here, take my hand.

01:24:33.181 --> 01:24:35.661
Forward ho!
