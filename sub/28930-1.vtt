01:10.269 --> 01:12.138
Today is a new day.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.540
I release all things
from yesterday.

01:14.540 --> 01:18.209
I release what
I ate, didn't eat,

01:18.209 --> 01:21.882
and trust in the fact
that today is a new day.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.218
I have control over pizza.

01:26.218 --> 01:29.522
I have more power
than French fries.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.191
I am all knowing, all trusting

01:32.191 --> 01:34.226
that chocolate has
no power over me.

01:34.226 --> 01:37.433
Chocolate has no
flipping power over me.

01:41.433 --> 01:42.537
Today is a new-

01:44.537 --> 01:47.640
Chocolate has
no power over me.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.509
Fuck.

01:50.509 --> 01:53.179
I am all knowing, all trusting.

01:53.179 --> 01:56.617
Today is a new day.

01:58.617 --> 01:59.952
Focus.

01:59.952 --> 02:01.420
Focus.

02:01.420 --> 02:02.922
Focus.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.958
Today is a new day.

02:05.958 --> 02:08.335
Chocolate has no power over me.

02:16.335 --> 02:17.569
<i> So,
 all you need for today</i>

02:17.569 --> 02:21.539
<i>is your "can do" attitude, your
willingness to feel that burn,</i>

02:21.539 --> 02:24.943
<i> and your
 "burn that horrible arm
 fat" Lola rubber band,</i>

02:24.943 --> 02:29.949
<i>and of course, as always, your
Lovely Lola Affirmations MP3s.</i>

02:29.949 --> 02:33.252
<i> Okay, you super
 rockin' body babes.</i>

02:33.252 --> 02:35.454
<i> Let's kick some serious ass,</i>

02:35.454 --> 02:40.328
<i> and ease our way down so
we can start our tummy blasters.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:44.964
<i>Count with me now, here we go.</i>

02:44.964 --> 02:51.736
<i> And one, and down, and
 two, and down, and three.</i>

02:51.736 --> 02:53.172
<i> Good, feel the burn.</i>

02:53.172 --> 02:59.578
<i> And four, and down, and five,
 you love it, down, and six.</i>

02:59.578 --> 03:00.512
<i> Don't forget to breathe.</i>

03:00.512 --> 03:02.313
<i> And exhale.</i>

03:02.313 --> 03:03.454
<i> And inhale.</i>

03:08.454 --> 03:10.788
<i> Twenty-nine, let
 me see that smile.</i>

03:10.788 --> 03:12.657
<i> And up.</i>

03:12.657 --> 03:15.494
<i> Twenty-eight, and down.</i>

03:15.494 --> 03:17.329
<i> Twenty-seven.</i>

03:17.329 --> 03:18.330
Jesus.

03:18.330 --> 03:22.668
<i> Pulse up, suck,
 suck, suck, suck.</i>

03:22.668 --> 03:25.541
<i> And release.</i>

03:29.541 --> 03:32.514
<i> And you're done with
 your tummy blasters.</i>

04:09.514 --> 04:11.620
Please, don't do this.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.093
Leon, he's your son.

04:21.093 --> 04:22.497
He did this, Angela.

04:25.497 --> 04:26.867
He made up his mind.

04:29.867 --> 04:31.404
He did this.

04:33.404 --> 04:34.108
<i> This is his choice.</i>

04:37.108 --> 04:38.430
<i> Get out.</i>

05:31.829 --> 05:32.701
One man.

05:35.701 --> 05:38.475
Two choices.

05:43.475 --> 05:44.579
Three people.

05:47.579 --> 05:48.449
Four.

05:50.449 --> 05:52.619
Forgetting who I am.

05:53.619 --> 05:54.555
Yeah.

05:56.555 --> 05:57.757
Shouldn't you be leaving?

05:59.757 --> 06:02.630
Uh, yeah.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.600
You know what
you're doing, right?

06:08.600 --> 06:12.440
New, or not, I don't
fuck around.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.786
Got it?

06:33.692 --> 06:36.795
Can you believe Leon asking
me if he can come back home?

06:37.795 --> 06:42.468
Come back home! I don't know
where the hell my damn son is,

06:42.468 --> 06:44.737
and he wants to know if
he can come back home!

06:45.737 --> 06:48.007
Hey, are you calling from work?
You know better than to call
from work when you're upset.

06:49.007 --> 06:50.642
<i> Call mom.</i>

06:50.642 --> 06:51.009
Okay. Okay.

06:53.711 --> 06:55.214
Oh, shoot. I gotta go.

06:55.214 --> 06:56.884
It's been two weeks.

06:58.884 --> 07:00.718
You think I should
file a police report?

07:00.718 --> 07:02.257
Yes, file a police report.

07:05.257 --> 07:06.726
Can I have your location please?

07:07.726 --> 07:10.262
Anyone there? Hello?

07:10.262 --> 07:12.964
Yes, hello, can I have
your location please?

07:12.964 --> 07:14.565
<i> Where I am?</i>

07:14.565 --> 07:16.901
Uh, yes, ma'am,
where are you, please?

07:16.901 --> 07:19.572
Three, one, two, two,
Carolwood Lane.

07:20.572 --> 07:21.074
Okay.

07:23.074 --> 07:25.980
Carolwood Lane,
the Mercy Building.
One moment, please.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.250
Okay. You are all set.

07:31.250 --> 07:36.255
Uh, please just remain calm.
Do not attempt to open the
doors, press the alarms.

07:36.255 --> 07:39.524
Our technicians
will be there shortly.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.827
<i> Can I have your
 location please?</i>

07:42.827 --> 07:43.096
Um, hi.

07:45.096 --> 07:47.766
It seems like this elevator's
not working. It won't move.

07:47.766 --> 07:48.701
Okay.

07:48.701 --> 07:51.870
Can I have your exact
location, please?

07:51.870 --> 07:55.740
Sure, um, ninth floor in the
Bank of the Nation building.

07:55.740 --> 07:57.817
<i> Thank you.
 One moment, please.</i>

08:05.817 --> 08:08.620
Alrighty, you are all set.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.723
Please don't activate the
alarms, open any doors.

08:11.723 --> 08:13.562
Our technicians
will be there shortly.

08:17.562 --> 08:19.968
Please, God, let
them be in my car.

08:22.968 --> 08:23.639
What?

08:27.639 --> 08:29.644
Please, not now!

08:32.644 --> 08:33.047
What?

08:35.047 --> 08:37.316
It's just not my day.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.784
What, is it not working
now? I was just in it.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.822
I don't know, man, I think
it was just on this floor.

08:43.822 --> 08:46.830
Gotta get to the garage.
I need my files.

08:51.830 --> 08:52.133
What the fuck?

08:55.133 --> 08:56.636
Not moving.

08:58.636 --> 09:02.807
OMG, they've been
working on this thing forever.

09:02.807 --> 09:05.711
I'm about to be late for work,
this just ain't my day.

09:11.616 --> 09:14.389
-This is so not happening.
-It's happening.

09:17.389 --> 09:19.198
I'm so screwed!

10:34.198 --> 10:38.004
Today is a new day.

10:39.004 --> 10:40.808
I have control over gluten.

10:43.808 --> 10:45.445
I have control over gluten.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.849
Today is a new day.

10:50.849 --> 10:52.918
I have control over gluten.

10:52.918 --> 10:56.822
I release all things
from yesterday.

10:56.822 --> 11:02.259
I release what I ate, didn't
eat, and trust in the fact
that today is a new day.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.496
I have control over gluten.

11:05.496 --> 11:07.899
I have more power than sugar,

11:07.899 --> 11:11.104
and I am knowing and all
trusting that carbs have

11:12.104 --> 11:13.240
no power over me.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.878
All is well in my world.

11:19.878 --> 11:22.047
All is well in my world.

11:22.047 --> 11:23.498
Okay.

11:39.498 --> 11:40.698
<i>Welcome to Day Four.</i>

11:40.698 --> 11:43.802
<i> You've almost made it
 through another week.</i>

11:43.802 --> 11:46.772
<i> Congratulations,

11:46.772 --> 11:53.979
<i> super take charge of your
 lifer's, super fighters, super
 kick ass, rockin' body babes.</i>

11:53.979 --> 11:58.884
<i> Today's focus is thighs
 and b- b- b- b- buns.</i>

11:58.884 --> 12:02.553
<i> So, all you need for today
 is your "can do" attitude,</i>

12:02.553 --> 12:04.822
<i> your willingness
 to feel that burn,</i>

12:04.822 --> 12:10.261
<i> and, of course,
 as always, your Lovely

12:10.261 --> 12:16.333
<i> Okay, you kick ass,
 rockin' body babes,
 let's ease our way down,</i>

12:16.333 --> 12:21.572
<i> so we can kick
 some serious ass

12:21.572 --> 12:29.947
<i> Here we go, and two,
 and three, feel the burn,
 four, five, and six,</i>

12:29.947 --> 12:34.553

12:34.553 --> 12:37.154
<i> -Lengthen, make our way up.</i>

12:37.154 --> 12:39.924
<i> Yes, here we go, let's
 get these thighs and
 buns going, and up-</i>

12:39.924 --> 12:41.059
Can I have your
location, please?

12:42.059 --> 12:45.163
Um, yeah, I am stuck
in an elevator.

12:45.163 --> 12:48.365
Okay, can I have
your location, please?

12:48.365 --> 12:50.902
I'm at the corner
of Pine and Woodward.

12:50.902 --> 12:52.346
<i> Thank you.
 One moment, please.</i>

13:01.346 --> 13:04.018
I'm sorry. Can I have your
exact location, please?

13:07.018 --> 13:10.922
I said I'm stuck in an
elevator at the corner
of Pine and Woodward.

13:10.922 --> 13:12.192
There is no fucking
exact location.

13:14.192 --> 13:15.327
Excuse me?

13:15.327 --> 13:20.966
Bitch, there is no
fucking location.

13:20.966 --> 13:25.035
In order to assist you, um,
you need to, adjust your tone,

13:25.035 --> 13:28.038
and tell me your exact
location, please.

13:28.038 --> 13:32.615
Adjust my tone? I'm stuck
in a fucking elevator!

13:36.615 --> 13:38.268
One moment, please.

14:30.268 --> 14:32.672
Oh, hell, no.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.474
He thinks I'm playing?

14:36.474 --> 14:38.943
That's right, you better run.

14:38.943 --> 14:40.047
You better watch your back.

14:42.047 --> 14:42.149
Watch your back.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.018
Oh, thank God that
vegan place is so close.

14:47.018 --> 14:50.288
It's on Sunset, right?
'Cause I prefer the one
in Santa Monica.

14:50.288 --> 14:53.057
I am so hungry.
I am, like, starving.

14:53.057 --> 14:55.493
Ugh, I hope they have
a gluten-free option.

14:55.493 --> 14:57.431
Oh, just wait! Wait!

14:59.431 --> 15:00.566
Damn elevator.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.336
Anyway, um, so, Colby,
I will be there in, like, ten.

15:05.336 --> 15:06.405
Hello?

15:08.405 --> 15:09.676
Hello?

15:10.676 --> 15:13.078
Oh, that's great,
my battery's dead,
that's just what I need.

15:14.078 --> 15:16.283
It's the flippin' longest
day in the world.

15:19.283 --> 15:20.352
I'll be okay.

15:21.352 --> 15:23.291
I'll be fine.

15:26.291 --> 15:30.097
All is well in my world.

15:33.097 --> 15:36.269
All is well in my world.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.317
What the hell?

16:26.317 --> 16:27.052
Hello?

16:28.052 --> 16:29.455
Anybody there?

16:30.455 --> 16:32.524
-Hello!
-There ain't anybody there, man.

16:33.524 --> 16:34.160
Somebody'll come soon.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.197
It's nine-twenty, I-

16:40.197 --> 16:41.101
It's nine-thirty.

16:43.101 --> 16:44.803
My review is now.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.105
This cannot be happening.

16:47.105 --> 16:49.378
OMG.

16:53.378 --> 16:54.280
OMG?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.087
Why you talkin' like that? You
some kinda fag or something?

17:03.087 --> 17:04.588
Oh, hell, no.

17:04.588 --> 17:08.259
I ain't about to get trapped
up here with some- fuck.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.867
This just ain't my day.

18:21.532 --> 18:27.606
Mother fucker!
What the fuck is happening?
What the fuck is happening?

18:29.606 --> 18:30.946
The fuck?

18:35.946 --> 18:38.250
Ma'am, please don't worry.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.652
We'll be alright.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.289
Stay away from me!

18:45.289 --> 18:46.924
Are you really a faggot?

18:46.924 --> 18:48.460
You really a nigger?

18:48.460 --> 18:52.329
Fuck, are you- listen
to this, mother fucker,
never, never, ever- look at-

18:52.329 --> 18:53.667
See there's a camera in here?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.236
Now what did you say, huh?

18:58.236 --> 19:01.605
Just asked you a question
in the same derogatory
manner you asked me yours.

19:01.605 --> 19:03.943
Well, you better
watch your mouth.

19:05.943 --> 19:07.479
Best watch yours.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.315
What, you lookin' for a ass
whoopin'? Is that what
turns you faggots on?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.650
You call me a faggot again,
and I swear to God,
I will call you a-

19:12.650 --> 19:14.352
That don't make no damn sense.

19:14.352 --> 19:18.556
They're both extremely
derogatory terms that our people
have worked so hard to overcome.

19:18.556 --> 19:20.057
Oh, what do you
mean, "our people"?

19:20.057 --> 19:22.693
Right, right, yeah,
you chose to be black
just like I chose to be gay.

19:22.693 --> 19:24.328
You ain't got nothin'
in common with my people,
you big sinnin' ass people.

19:24.328 --> 19:25.730
Your people have never been
spat on, hung, or murdered.

19:25.730 --> 19:29.570
No, your people have
nothing whatsoever
in common with my people!

19:33.570 --> 19:36.675
Well, ain't this some
crazy white boy shit?

19:38.675 --> 19:40.247
I know what the Bible says.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.712
You people goin'
straight to hell.

20:15.712 --> 20:19.049
- <i> Seven,
 last five. Five, suck it in.</i>

20:19.049 --> 20:20.685
<i> Can I have
 your location, please?</i>

20:21.685 --> 20:23.621
Oh, oh yes. Uh, sorry.

20:23.621 --> 20:25.355
Bridge Street.

20:25.355 --> 20:27.557
Five, one, five,
one Bridge Street.

20:27.557 --> 20:28.027
Uh, what street was that?

20:29.027 --> 20:30.560
Bridge Street.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.762
Breesh Street?

20:31.762 --> 20:34.767
Five, one, five,
one Bridge Street.

20:35.767 --> 20:39.037
Uh, um, can you repeat
that? Your accent, I-
I don't understand.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.771
Bridge Street.

20:40.771 --> 20:42.509
One moment, please.

20:45.509 --> 20:49.047
<i> So, that's fifty-one,
 fifty-one Breesh Street.</i>

20:49.047 --> 20:52.049
I- I- I'm sorry, that's not
showing up on my system.

20:52.049 --> 20:53.684
Bridge Street.

20:53.684 --> 20:55.053
Breesh Street?

20:55.053 --> 20:56.320
Bridge Street.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.422
Breesh Street?

20:57.422 --> 20:58.722
Bridge Street.

20:58.722 --> 21:00.057
Breesh Street?

21:00.057 --> 21:03.394
Oh my God, Bridge Street.

21:03.394 --> 21:05.762
Alright? As in London
fucking Bridge.

21:05.762 --> 21:07.365
B- R-I-D- G- E.

21:07.365 --> 21:14.071
Okay? We are stuck in an-
in an elevator at fifty-one,
fifty-one Bridge Street.

21:14.071 --> 21:15.708
Okay? Help us!

21:16.708 --> 21:17.082
One moment, please.

21:24.082 --> 21:27.818
<i> Okay, that's fifty-one,
 fifty-one Bridge Street.</i>

21:27.818 --> 21:31.556
Please don't attempt to open
the doors, press any buttons.

21:31.556 --> 21:34.125
Our technicians
will be there shortly.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.795
Okay, shortly,
when is that exactly?

21:37.795 --> 21:39.529
Um, just a few minutes.

21:39.529 --> 21:40.031
Please relax, ma'am.

21:41.031 --> 21:43.769
Bitch, how am I supposed
to relax when I'm stuck
in a elevator with a-

21:44.769 --> 21:47.440
Stuck in an elevator
with a... ma'am?

21:49.440 --> 21:50.144
Ma'am? I believe
you are saying?

21:54.644 --> 21:55.846
Hey.

21:55.846 --> 21:57.481
Is there a problem?

21:57.481 --> 22:00.384
Uh, no, Gunther, I'm
simply doing my job.

22:00.384 --> 22:04.521
I've been listening to your last
few calls, and I feel really
bad for these people, Trina.

22:04.521 --> 22:06.457
Quite frankly, you
sound like a bitch.

22:06.457 --> 22:07.724
Is there a problem, Trina?

22:07.724 --> 22:09.728
I'm simply doing
my job, Gunther.

22:10.728 --> 22:13.597
Does the fact that
you get to work from
the comfort of your home

22:13.597 --> 22:14.134
not mean anything
to you anymore?

22:16.134 --> 22:17.903
Do you wanna come back
into the office, Trina?

22:18.903 --> 22:19.737
No.

22:19.737 --> 22:22.607
I suggest you watch
your tone, then.

22:23.607 --> 22:25.742
Okay, sorry. Didn't- didn't
mean to have a tone.

22:25.742 --> 22:27.480
Why do you people take
things so personally?

22:29.480 --> 22:29.882
This is your job.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.616
When people get upset

22:32.616 --> 22:36.686
and take it out on you, is it
or is it not your responsibility

22:36.686 --> 22:39.656
to do your job to the
best of your ability?

22:39.656 --> 22:41.759
Yes. Of course, yes.

22:41.759 --> 22:45.430
You need to have some
compassion. You need
to sound like you care.

22:45.430 --> 22:48.633
You need to be there
for them. You need to
save them. That is your job.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.769
How many times do
I need to tell you this?

22:51.769 --> 22:54.873
I- I just don't think
it's right that we
get talked down to.

22:55.873 --> 22:58.809
Oh, you don't think it's right
that you get talked down to?

22:58.809 --> 23:01.746
Maybe you should take
it up with HR then.

23:01.746 --> 23:04.515
Perhaps they wanna hear
what you have to say about
being talked down to.

23:04.515 --> 23:09.753
Or, they have other people
who would appreciate this
job in this dismal economy.

23:09.753 --> 23:11.522
Do you want a new job, Trina?

23:12.522 --> 23:13.790
No.

23:13.790 --> 23:14.827
Then do your job!

23:16.827 --> 23:19.196
Your job is to be
there for them.

23:19.196 --> 23:20.698
To save them.

23:20.698 --> 23:22.834
-Your job is to care.
-I do care.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.241
Gotta go, Gunther.

23:31.241 --> 23:32.978
Is that really what you think?

23:33.978 --> 23:35.807
That I'm going to hell?

24:02.807 --> 24:03.545
Those smell good.

24:07.545 --> 24:08.315
Don't speak to me.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.682
I just don't understand how
somebody with your background
could be such a bigot.

24:12.682 --> 24:15.586
-It just doesn't make
any sense to me.
-Boy, you better stop.

24:15.586 --> 24:17.721
You're destroying
those beautiful roses.

24:17.721 --> 24:19.923
You take 'em then! Damn it!

25:25.923 --> 25:30.126
<i> Yes.
 Mm, feels so good.</i>

25:30.126 --> 25:33.163
<i> And, exhale.</i>

27:12.163 --> 27:15.434
You know, back home
when I was a boy,

27:17.434 --> 27:20.708
I used to eat a lot of oranges.

27:23.708 --> 27:27.182
Those oranges back home
were the size of your head.

27:31.182 --> 27:32.085
Yeah.

27:34.085 --> 27:36.887
I used to sell them
on the train to town.

27:37.887 --> 27:40.492
Every summer on Saturdays.

27:42.492 --> 27:43.261
Yeah.

27:45.261 --> 27:47.269
They were so sweet.

27:53.269 --> 27:54.076
Very sweet.

28:00.076 --> 28:03.913
Your, um, your accent,

28:03.913 --> 28:05.952
it, uh, it sounds familiar.

28:07.952 --> 28:09.753
I feel like I've
heard it before.

28:09.753 --> 28:11.523
Uh, are you from Jamaica?

28:13.523 --> 28:15.125
Oh.

28:15.125 --> 28:17.528
-What, did I-
-Ai-yi.

28:17.528 --> 28:20.964
You Americans are so funny.

28:20.964 --> 28:22.834
Ai. Yeah.

28:23.834 --> 28:25.506
Okay, well, then
where are you from?

28:28.506 --> 28:29.307
I'm from Jamaica.

28:30.307 --> 28:31.210
Yeah, man.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.545
Jamaica, man.

28:34.545 --> 28:36.518
Kingston Jamaica, yeah.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.888
Really though?
All joking aside,

28:44.888 --> 28:46.528
I am from South Africa.

28:50.528 --> 28:51.198
Oh.

28:54.198 --> 28:55.270
You been there?

29:00.270 --> 29:01.339
I was born there.

29:03.339 --> 29:04.824
Oh.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.328
But, the way you speak.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.097
You sound American.

29:28.097 --> 29:29.568
Very American, eh?

29:31.568 --> 29:32.002
Yeah.

29:33.002 --> 29:35.144
Where are these people, anyway?

29:41.144 --> 29:42.613
Hello?

29:42.613 --> 29:43.713
Hello?

29:43.713 --> 29:45.249
<i> Reach, reach, reach,
 reach, reach. Ah.</i>

29:45.249 --> 29:47.884
<i> And release.</i>

29:47.884 --> 29:49.720
Can I have your
location please?

29:49.720 --> 29:53.958
<i> Yeah, we're still stuck
 in an elevator at fifty-one,
 fifty-one Bridge Street.</i>

29:53.958 --> 29:57.228
<i> It's only been ten minutes.
 Someone will be there shortly.</i>

29:57.228 --> 29:59.596
<i>Okay, yeah, but we really need
to get out, so can you please-</i>

29:59.596 --> 30:02.336
<i> Please relax, ma'am.
 They'll be there soon.</i>

30:06.336 --> 30:07.606
See that?

30:09.606 --> 30:14.047
We are from the same
country, but you,
she could understand.

30:17.047 --> 30:19.349
I'm sorry, man,
but I'm a Christian,

30:19.349 --> 30:22.952
and I don't wanna hear
about your boyfriend
and all this gay shit. Damn.

30:22.952 --> 30:24.355
You don't understand.

30:24.355 --> 30:26.093
I can't be hearing
about- no, it's my-

30:29.093 --> 30:30.229
Just not the day, okay?

30:32.229 --> 30:33.032
Damn.

30:36.032 --> 30:38.972
It's just not my day, Lord.

30:42.972 --> 30:44.175
As God is my witness,

30:46.175 --> 30:47.444
I'm so sorry.

30:48.444 --> 30:49.721
Please forgive me.

31:48.505 --> 31:50.173
<i> Can I have
 your location, please?</i>

31:50.173 --> 31:51.241
Um, yeah.

31:51.241 --> 31:54.510
I'm still stuck, and I'm
having problems breathing.

31:54.510 --> 31:56.980
<i> Okay, ma'am, I can
 send emergency.</i>

31:56.980 --> 31:58.481
<i> Can I have your
 location, please?</i>

31:58.481 --> 32:00.517
I'm at the Mercy Building.

32:00.517 --> 32:03.189
Three, one, two,
two, Carolwood Lane.

32:05.189 --> 32:07.224
Oh, my God.
You're still there?

32:08.224 --> 32:09.464
One moment, please.

32:14.464 --> 32:18.335
This is dispatch at five,
zero, four, two, six.

32:18.335 --> 32:22.071
We still have a woman trapped
at the Mercy Building location.

32:22.071 --> 32:25.209
She has been there
for some time and is
having trouble breathing.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.211
Please send
emergency right away.

32:34.751 --> 32:35.487
Ma'am?

32:36.487 --> 32:38.189
Ma'am, I- I'm so
sorry about this.

32:38.189 --> 32:43.126
Please remain calm, stay
seated, don't try to open the
doors or activate the alarms.

32:43.126 --> 32:45.061
Emergency will
be there shortly.

32:45.061 --> 32:46.363
Okay.

32:46.363 --> 32:47.269
Okay, please hurry.

32:52.269 --> 32:53.506
Ma'am?

32:55.506 --> 32:56.210
Ma'am?

33:00.210 --> 33:01.486
Hello?

33:11.255 --> 33:12.388
Hello, Trina.

33:12.388 --> 33:14.558
You been working on your tone?

33:15.558 --> 33:19.496
Uh, excuse me. Gunther,
I have a- a woman stuck
at the Mercy Building,

33:19.496 --> 33:21.266
and she's having
problems breathing.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.401
Did you follow call
center procedure?

33:24.401 --> 33:25.236
Yes, of course.

33:26.236 --> 33:28.271
What do you want from me, then?

33:28.271 --> 33:29.507
Um, I don't know.

33:29.507 --> 33:34.077
Send our men to her right away
so the EMTs can get to her?

33:34.077 --> 33:35.547
You're sounding hostile again.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.582
I'm still not impressed
with your tone.

33:38.582 --> 33:40.817
What's the problem, Trina?

33:40.817 --> 33:42.419
There's no problem, Gunther.

33:42.419 --> 33:45.122
I am just concerned
about this woman.

33:45.122 --> 33:47.590
Just because you're
fat and all alone

33:47.590 --> 33:52.165
doesn't mean you have the
right to take it out on these
poor, trapped people, or on me.

33:56.165 --> 33:57.567
I'm joking.

33:57.567 --> 33:58.502
Hilarious.

33:59.502 --> 34:00.471
No, no, no.

34:00.471 --> 34:04.142
Trina, you're a very
special dispatch agent.

34:05.142 --> 34:08.179
That is why you get
to work from home.
You have seniority.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.882
Not all dispatch agents
get to work from home.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.449
I know that. That's not wha-

34:13.449 --> 34:16.521
If you know that, then you
have to watch your tone.

34:17.521 --> 34:20.356
Otherwise, do you
want a new job, Trina?

34:20.356 --> 34:21.492
No.

34:22.492 --> 34:23.594
I mean, let's face it.

34:24.594 --> 34:28.532
A fat, lonely woman with
a high school education.

34:28.532 --> 34:30.601
What else could you possibly do?

34:31.601 --> 34:33.202
Hilarious.

34:33.202 --> 34:34.871
Jokes, Trina, jokes.

34:34.871 --> 34:39.876
I love this joking with you.
So much fun! Right? So much
fun we're having together.

34:39.876 --> 34:40.210
Right?

34:42.210 --> 34:43.333
Right.

35:03.333 --> 35:06.235
I cannot be late to my
meditation class tonight, Colby.

35:06.235 --> 35:09.907
I am so sorry, but you
know how much it helps
centers me, and, you know,

35:09.907 --> 35:13.610
connects me to
a universal source,
which I so need right now

35:13.610 --> 35:17.724
because this internship
is like, so not what I'm
supposed to be doing.

35:28.724 --> 35:33.463
I never knew that
the Reiki experience
could be that intense.

35:33.463 --> 35:39.974
Like, OMG, I just, I'm so
more aligned with my true
path than, like, ever before.

35:44.974 --> 35:48.277
...has no clue about the
deeper meaning of life.

35:48.277 --> 35:51.315
I mean, she's just
so disconnected,
totally ungrounded.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.650
I just, I find it hard to
believe that anyone could
be that, like, oblivious

35:54.650 --> 35:56.753
to the obvious universal truth.

35:56.753 --> 36:00.699
Yeah, connection.
You know? I'm like, I don't
know what to think about that.

36:09.699 --> 36:13.474
<i> All is well
 in my world.</i>

36:18.474 --> 36:19.978
It's funny.

36:21.978 --> 36:22.016
You know?

36:27.016 --> 36:30.422
I know it isn't
funny "ha-ha," but

36:33.422 --> 36:37.666
funny that this isn't the first
time that I've received roses
meant for somebody else.

36:42.666 --> 36:44.268
Charlene gave 'em to me.

36:45.268 --> 36:46.005
Gave 'em back to me.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.342
I picked her up
for senior prom.

36:52.342 --> 36:54.614
I was so excited I got
to borrow my mom's car.

36:57.614 --> 36:59.050
My parents were so confused.

37:01.050 --> 37:02.387
I told them everything.

37:04.387 --> 37:05.423
'Bout the rumor.

37:07.423 --> 37:08.827
How it was true.

37:11.827 --> 37:14.766
That's the last time
I ever saw my parents.

37:16.766 --> 37:19.608
And the last time I received
roses meant for somebody else.

37:25.608 --> 37:26.378
Until today.

37:29.378 --> 37:30.420
The roses part, I mean.

37:37.420 --> 37:38.556
I always liked roses too.

37:40.556 --> 37:42.862
Favorite flower, actually.

37:45.862 --> 37:47.065
He loves me.

37:49.065 --> 37:50.802
He loves me not.

37:51.802 --> 37:52.670
He loves me.

37:54.670 --> 37:55.074
He loves me not.

37:58.074 --> 37:59.679
He loves me!

38:03.679 --> 38:06.885
Come on, don't you have
a special lady in your life?

38:08.885 --> 38:10.119
Come on.

38:10.119 --> 38:10.454
Play.

38:11.454 --> 38:12.829
It'll help kill the time.

38:19.829 --> 38:21.630
She loves me.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.733
Hm.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.769
She loves me not.

38:26.769 --> 38:27.112
She loves me.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.648
She loves me not.

38:39.648 --> 38:40.920
He did this, Angela.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.592
He made up his mind.

38:48.592 --> 38:49.795
He did this.

38:51.795 --> 38:53.699
This is his choice.

38:56.699 --> 38:57.769
Oh Lord.

38:59.769 --> 39:00.172
Mom.

39:03.172 --> 39:04.478
Please look at me.

39:08.478 --> 39:09.521
Mom.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.534
I'm so sorry.

40:04.534 --> 40:06.543
You can leave now.

40:13.543 --> 40:14.746
Get out.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.914
I'll just be in the bedroom
if you need anything.

40:17.914 --> 40:20.918
Bedroom? I said get out.

40:21.918 --> 40:23.786
Get outta my house.

40:23.786 --> 40:25.559
-Angela, look, I know-
-Get out!

40:29.559 --> 40:30.494
You alright?

40:31.494 --> 40:32.266
Of course.

40:37.266 --> 40:40.538
Did I ever tell you the story
about my first year in college?

40:41.538 --> 40:44.608
I'm sorry, Gunther,
but I'm not really in the
mood to hear one of your-

40:44.608 --> 40:46.710
Fine, alright, geez.

40:46.710 --> 40:47.978
Yeah.

40:48.978 --> 40:50.047
You gotta tell me, though,

40:51.047 --> 40:53.983
why didn't you go to college?

40:53.983 --> 40:56.719
You're not very smart,
right?

40:56.719 --> 40:58.922
Hilarious.

40:59.922 --> 41:02.561
Um, no, seriously, though.
Tell me. Wh- why- why
didn't you go to college?

41:05.561 --> 41:08.032
I didn't qualify for financial
aid, and I couldn't afford it.

41:09.032 --> 41:11.735
I've told you this
many times, Gunther.

41:11.735 --> 41:15.605
What do you think is going to
happen when foreigners are the
only ones who are rich enough

41:15.605 --> 41:19.775
to go to our top universities,
Trina? Hm? What happens then?

41:19.775 --> 41:21.945
You realize that
is what's happening.

41:22.945 --> 41:24.081
What's going to
happen then, Trina?

41:24.081 --> 41:27.684
I- I don't know.
Why are you asking
me? Why are you-

41:27.684 --> 41:30.887
Maybe then everyone
will be just like you.

41:31.887 --> 41:34.724
Working in a call
center, from home,

41:35.724 --> 41:39.764
fat and alone,
on their computers,

41:40.764 --> 41:44.099
on social sites all day,
liking pictures and shit.

41:44.099 --> 41:45.702
Just like you.

41:46.702 --> 41:48.974
You're America's future, Trina.

41:51.974 --> 41:52.045
It's hilarious.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.719
Oh, I love this joking
with you, Trina.

42:03.719 --> 42:05.356
<i>Lesson for Day Five.</i>

42:06.356 --> 42:08.059
<i> You are here for a reason.</i>

42:09.059 --> 42:11.927
<i> The reason is not your job.</i>

42:11.927 --> 42:13.864
<i> The reason is not to eat.</i>

42:14.864 --> 42:18.135
<i>God didn't put you here to gain
 weight, to turn to blubber,</i>

42:20.135 --> 42:23.342
<i> to be an obese, fat pig
or a victim that gets attacked.</i>

42:25.342 --> 42:27.643
<i> You are here for a reason.</i>

42:27.643 --> 42:29.144
<i> Repeat after me.</i>

42:29.144 --> 42:31.648
<i> I am here for a reason.</i>

42:31.648 --> 42:32.949
I am here for a reason.

42:33.949 --> 42:35.385
<i> Food is not the reason.</i>

42:35.385 --> 42:36.885
Food is not the reason.

42:36.885 --> 42:38.722
<i> You are not a victim.</i>

42:38.722 --> 42:39.956
I am not a victim.

42:39.956 --> 42:41.791
<i> I am a fighter, a survivor.</i>

42:41.791 --> 42:43.126
<i> I am here for a reason.</i>

42:43.126 --> 42:45.961
I'm a fighter, a survivor.
I'm here for a reason.

42:45.961 --> 42:48.664
<i> All is well in my world.</i>

42:48.664 --> 42:49.967
All is well in my world.

42:49.967 --> 42:52.768
<i> Make sure to repeat this
 chant throughout the day.</i>

42:52.768 --> 42:56.106
<i> Remember, you are
 here for a reason.</i>

42:56.106 --> 42:57.175
Where these people at, anyway?

42:59.175 --> 43:00.710
I know, right?

43:01.710 --> 43:02.981
I already missed my meeting.

43:03.981 --> 43:05.117
I think that they were gonna
make me full time today too.

43:07.117 --> 43:09.052
We could really use the money.

43:09.052 --> 43:10.123
My boyfriend and I

43:13.123 --> 43:15.728
have... Yeah, well, anyway,
I- I could really use the money.

43:18.728 --> 43:20.400
Where were you going
with these roses, anyway?

43:23.400 --> 43:26.170
Apologize to my wife, Angela,
for a fight we had weeks ago.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.007
She still won't let
me come home.

43:32.007 --> 43:33.943
Women.

43:34.943 --> 43:35.213
Sorry.

43:37.213 --> 43:38.181
Fights suck.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.887
My boyfriend and I are...

43:43.887 --> 43:45.422
You said Angela?

43:46.422 --> 43:48.157
I know an Angela that
works on the twelfth floor.

43:48.157 --> 43:50.893
Yeah, Angela works on the
twelfth floor at that medi-

43:50.893 --> 43:52.429
I totally know her.

43:52.429 --> 43:55.916
She's my boyfriend's
mother, she's Bernard's m-

44:13.916 --> 44:18.123
You claim to be South
African, but you don't
recognize my accent.

44:20.123 --> 44:21.391
How can you not know?

44:22.391 --> 44:26.164
I'm sure you must have heard
black South Africans speak.

44:28.164 --> 44:28.969
Right?

44:32.969 --> 44:33.938
Right?

44:34.938 --> 44:37.172
Okay, my mother and I left
when I was ten years old.

44:37.172 --> 44:39.809
Okay? We didn't have
a choice. We had to go.

44:39.809 --> 44:40.943
Okay?

44:40.943 --> 44:43.947
No choice? Impossible.

44:43.947 --> 44:45.853
You people always have a choice.

44:49.853 --> 44:52.288
You know, a few years after
Mandela became president,

44:52.288 --> 44:55.257
things in my neighborhood
began to change.

44:55.257 --> 44:57.094
And not for the better,
okay? For worse.

44:59.094 --> 45:03.166
You see, my father's bottle
shop was getting burglarized
almost every single night,

45:03.166 --> 45:05.835
and the police oftentimes
wouldn't even show up for hours

45:05.835 --> 45:08.871
because these new
policemen were black.

45:08.871 --> 45:09.974
You see?

45:11.974 --> 45:14.248
So, you're the piece
of shit father that stopped
payments on his tuition?

45:18.248 --> 45:19.949
You know he might
not graduate?

45:20.949 --> 45:22.820
Do you know what he's
been doing for money?

45:23.820 --> 45:26.054
Angela can't make
the tuition on her own.

45:26.054 --> 45:31.860
Do you- do you have any fucking
idea what this is doing to him?
He's completely given up.

45:31.860 --> 45:32.164
He's lost, he-

45:34.164 --> 45:35.900
He won't even talk to me.

45:37.900 --> 45:41.204
Of course Angela won't
take you back, won't
take those fucking roses.

45:42.204 --> 45:44.840
She's worried sick about him.

45:44.840 --> 45:49.246
I'm worried sick! He's
completely torn up about this.

45:50.246 --> 45:51.282
I can't-

45:53.282 --> 45:55.891
I can't! Fuck!

46:01.891 --> 46:05.094
We'd just returned from my
ten year birthday celebration

46:06.094 --> 46:11.101
when the neighbors came to the
gate and told my parents that
the robbers were at it again.

46:13.101 --> 46:17.007
My dad, just being so fed up
and angry, he grabbed his-

46:18.007 --> 46:21.179
his gun, and our dog, Lex,
and he sped off in the car.

46:23.179 --> 46:26.150
Before my mother and
I even knew what had
happened, it- just- it,

46:27.150 --> 46:28.152
it happened so fast.

46:30.152 --> 46:33.155
<i> So fast, it- My mother
 and I didn't know what to do,</i>

46:33.155 --> 46:36.594
<i> so she told me to go into
 my room and stay there.</i>

46:38.594 --> 46:43.266
<i> So, I went in my room,
 and I took off my brand
 new, pink birthday dress.</i>

46:44.266 --> 46:47.606
And I put on my pajamas,
and I brushed my teeth,

46:50.606 --> 46:54.643
and I peered out
through my bedroom door,

46:54.643 --> 46:57.981
and as I watched my
mother call for the police...

46:58.981 --> 47:00.251
Just nothing.

47:01.251 --> 47:03.954
I watched as she tried
to fix the phone.

47:04.954 --> 47:06.324
Again nothing.

47:09.324 --> 47:15.965
It must have been after
midnight when the police
finally came to our gate.

47:16.965 --> 47:22.907
And I ran to the window
and watched as my mother
talked to the policeman.

47:23.907 --> 47:31.981
I, I saw her scream
before I actually heard it.

47:32.981 --> 47:35.654
Her entire body just froze.

47:37.654 --> 47:44.661
It felt like a year before I
finally heard her say "No, no."

47:45.661 --> 47:47.168
"Oh, my God, no."

47:52.168 --> 47:53.271
Daddy!

47:56.271 --> 47:57.364
Daddy.

48:21.364 --> 48:24.971
I too lost my father.

48:27.971 --> 48:29.039
At the age of ten.

48:31.039 --> 48:32.753
Special Branch.

48:43.753 --> 48:45.322
I'm so sorry.

48:47.322 --> 48:48.309
It's alright.

50:02.465 --> 50:04.500
- <i> Seven, and six.</i>
- I'm here for a reason.

50:04.500 --> 50:09.539
<i> Smile it out, four,
 and three, and two.</i>

50:09.539 --> 50:11.139
I'm a fighter.

50:11.139 --> 50:13.210
<i> -One. And breathe.</i>
-Fighter.

50:14.210 --> 50:15.512
<i> Here we go. Get going.</i>

50:15.512 --> 50:18.380
-Fighter.
-<i> Let's get those buns
 going. And up.</i>

50:18.380 --> 50:20.817
<i> Good. Feel it up.
 Squeeze that butt.</i>

50:20.817 --> 50:22.217
<i> Bathing suit butt.</i>

50:22.217 --> 50:23.385
<i> Lift it up.</i>

50:23.385 --> 50:24.454
<i> Suck it in.</i>

50:24.454 --> 50:26.521
<i> And ten, eleven.</i>

50:26.521 --> 50:28.157
<i> Good. Add the head.</i>

50:28.157 --> 50:29.324
<i> And go.</i>

50:29.324 --> 50:30.460
<i> And up.</i>

50:30.460 --> 50:31.427
<i> And up.</i>

50:31.427 --> 50:32.594
<i> Good. Squeeze.</i>

50:32.594 --> 50:33.829
<i> And squeeze.</i>

50:33.829 --> 50:35.264
<i> And pulse.</i>

50:35.264 --> 50:40.302
<i> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
 five, four, three, two, one.</i>

50:40.302 --> 50:42.170
<i> Good, let's pulse
 it up to the side.</i>

50:42.170 --> 50:44.840
<i> Get that piriformis
 going. And up.</i>

50:44.840 --> 50:50.378
<i> All of those little sags
 we hate out of the sides
 of our jeans, pulse it.</i>

50:50.378 --> 50:52.148
<i> And pulse it.</i>

50:52.148 --> 50:53.849
<i> And pulse, hold it up.</i>

50:53.849 --> 50:55.585
<i> Now, up, up from
 your high spot.</i>

50:55.585 --> 50:57.385
<i> Squeeze. Feel the burn.</i>

50:57.385 --> 51:00.322
<i> Yes, you love it!
 Ten more times.</i>

51:00.322 --> 51:05.260
<i> -Eight, seven, six,
 four, three, two, one.</i>

51:05.260 --> 51:08.563
<i> And, stretch those buns.</i>

51:08.563 --> 51:10.132
<i> -And release.</i>
<i>-  Hello?</i>

51:10.132 --> 51:13.135
Alright, so where was I? Right.

51:13.135 --> 51:14.538
Who needs an education anyways?

51:15.538 --> 51:17.407
We Americans
are great Olympians.

51:18.407 --> 51:20.677
Hey, maybe, maybe if you get
fired, you can be an Olympian.

51:21.677 --> 51:24.413
Uh, what's your, what's
your favorite sport, Trina?

51:24.413 --> 51:26.481
I don't have a favorite
sport, Gunther.

51:26.481 --> 51:27.920
Trina.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.257
Gymnastics.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.690
I- I like gymnastics.

51:35.690 --> 51:36.295
Hm.

51:39.295 --> 51:40.364
Yeah.

51:41.364 --> 51:42.632
Gymnastics.

51:42.632 --> 51:45.235
But what's the one
with, uh, that?

51:46.235 --> 51:48.507
- Th- that'd be-
that could work.

51:51.507 --> 51:52.909
Can I have your
location, please?

51:52.909 --> 51:54.677
<i> Anybody there? Hello?</i>

51:54.677 --> 51:56.413
Hello? Anybody there?

51:57.413 --> 51:58.681
Fuck it.

51:58.681 --> 52:00.721
Hello?

52:05.721 --> 52:07.226
Hello? Anybody there?

52:10.226 --> 52:11.279
Hello?

52:30.279 --> 52:31.583
<i> Trina.</i>

52:33.583 --> 52:37.690
<i> Why do you people take things
so personally? Maybe if you get
 fired, you can be an Olympian.</i>

52:40.690 --> 52:42.963
Oh, yes.

52:46.963 --> 52:50.501
Oh. Oh. Mm.

52:52.501 --> 52:53.590
Oh shit.

53:26.434 --> 53:28.572
All is well in my world.

55:16.846 --> 55:18.115
I am so worried about Bernard.

55:20.115 --> 55:23.652
Look, Angela, don't you think
the two of you should maybe
work together to find him?

55:24.652 --> 55:29.391
You know, sometimes
I don't even know
why I bother to call you.

55:29.391 --> 55:31.594
Work with Leon?

55:31.594 --> 55:35.630
He's the reason we're
in this situation in the
first damn place!

55:35.630 --> 55:38.567
You know what? Maybe if
you weren't such a shut-in,

55:38.567 --> 55:41.570
and you actually came
out of your apartment,

55:41.570 --> 55:45.552
maybe you could just be useful
and actually help me! Shit!

55:56.552 --> 55:58.556
All is well in my world.

56:00.556 --> 56:02.766
All is well in my world.

56:10.766 --> 56:14.639
<i>Exhale. Drop. Breathe.</i>

56:16.639 --> 56:18.465
<i> You are not a victim.</i>

56:43.465 --> 56:44.699
<i> And down.</i>

56:44.699 --> 56:45.800
<i> And exhale.</i>

56:45.800 --> 56:48.570
<i> And down. Good,
 that's- we got forty.</i>

56:48.570 --> 56:49.938
<i> You're almost there.</i>

56:49.938 --> 56:51.239
<i> Now thirty-nine.</i>

56:51.239 --> 56:52.775
<i> And down.</i>

56:52.775 --> 56:53.976
<i> Thirty-eight.</i>

56:53.976 --> 56:56.612
<i> And down.
 Oh God, oh yes.</i>

56:56.612 --> 56:57.612
<i> I know this is hard.</i>

56:57.612 --> 56:58.914
Ow!

56:58.914 --> 57:01.818
<i> But you can do it, you
 kick ass, rockin' body babe.</i>

57:02.818 --> 57:04.956
Can I have your
location, please?

57:06.956 --> 57:07.989
Hello?

57:07.989 --> 57:09.860
<i> -Mm, feels so good.</i>
-Damn.

57:11.860 --> 57:14.697
Where did you go?
You missed another call.

57:14.697 --> 57:16.632
-<i> Ah. Exhale.</i>
-Yeah, I- I'm sorry.

57:16.632 --> 57:17.867
Sorry about that.

57:17.867 --> 57:20.768
It's alright, just don't
let it happen again.

57:20.768 --> 57:22.271
<i> -And open up.</i>
-Okay.

57:22.271 --> 57:23.809
<i> Ah.</i>

57:26.809 --> 57:28.710
What is that?

57:28.710 --> 57:30.679
-Are you watching porn? <i>
 -Yeah.</i>

57:31.679 --> 57:33.715
Oh God. No. No.

57:33.715 --> 57:34.849
This is not porn.

57:34.849 --> 57:35.992
<i> Ah!</i>

57:43.992 --> 57:47.295
Whatever. Um,
just wanted to let you know
that everything went well

57:47.295 --> 57:50.532
with the Mercy Building
lady, and that we're
waiting on dispatch

57:50.532 --> 57:53.034
for the, uh, the- the
Bridge Street order.

57:53.034 --> 57:54.170
Okay. Thanks.

57:56.170 --> 57:59.943
Did I ever, um, tell you
the story about my days
as a long-distance runner?

58:00.943 --> 58:05.681
I- I'm sorry, Gunther,
I'm not really in the mood
to hear one of your stories.

58:05.681 --> 58:07.652
Fine, fine.

58:09.652 --> 58:12.324
What do you got going
on this weekend? D- do
you ever go anywhere?

58:15.324 --> 58:17.760
I don't know. Nothing.
W- why are you asking?

58:17.760 --> 58:20.896
Don't you think it's sad? Huh?

58:20.896 --> 58:22.831
<i> You have nothin'
 going on in your life.</i>

58:22.831 --> 58:24.666
Just this job.

58:24.666 --> 58:26.869
And your television.

58:26.869 --> 58:27.904
Watching.

58:28.904 --> 58:30.108
Watching whatever
it is you're watching.

58:33.108 --> 58:34.710
It's not porn.

58:35.710 --> 58:39.047
Geez, Louise. I'm kidding.

58:39.047 --> 58:40.318
Hilarious.

58:42.318 --> 58:43.586
Did you need anything else?

58:44.586 --> 58:46.090
Best watch your tone, Trina.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.896
Hello?

58:53.896 --> 58:55.032
Come on. Hello?

58:57.032 --> 58:57.001
Oh, my God.

59:00.001 --> 59:00.670
Hello?

59:01.670 --> 59:03.038
Hello!

59:03.038 --> 59:04.679
You bitch!

59:10.679 --> 59:12.681
<i> Do you want
 a new job, Trina?</i>

59:12.681 --> 59:17.719
<i> Maybe if you weren't
such a shut in, and you actually
 came out of your apartment...</i>

59:17.719 --> 59:19.655
- <i> Bitch!
 -And up.</i>

59:19.655 --> 59:24.860
<i> You're not very  smart, right?
 Just because  you're fat and all alone...</i>

59:24.860 --> 59:26.996
<i> I know these bands
 are tight. They're tight.</i>

59:26.996 --> 59:29.898
<i> -</i> <i> Hello? Somebody
 please help! Hello?
 -</i> <i> So tight.</i>

59:29.898 --> 59:31.900
<i> Amazing.</i>

59:31.900 --> 59:37.873
<i> A fat, grown woman?
What else could you possibly do?
 Best watch your tone, Trina.</i>

59:37.873 --> 59:40.708
- <i> Kick ass
 arms. Pull. Pulse it. Pull.</i>
<i>-  Somebody please help!</i>

59:40.708 --> 59:42.411
<i>Hit that wall and squeeze it up.</i>

59:42.411 --> 59:44.713
<i> And up. Last twenty.</i>

59:44.713 --> 59:46.181
<i> Twenty, come on,
 feel it. Nineteen.</i>

59:46.181 --> 59:47.815
<i> You missed
 another call.</i>

59:47.815 --> 59:49.451
<i> Eighteen,
 oh, amazing. Yes!</i>

59:49.451 --> 59:52.188
<i> You have  nothing going on in  your life.
 Just this job.</i>

59:54.188 --> 59:57.059
<i> I don't even know
 why I bother to call you.</i>

59:57.059 --> 59:59.161
<i> -</i> <i> You're  not very smart.
- </i> -<i> You bitch!</i>

59:59.161 --> 00:00.429
<i> Fat and alone.</i>

01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:01.132
<i> Help us!</i>

01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:10.440
<i> Yes, two,
 and one. Good. And breathe.</i>

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.675
<i> And pulse.</i>

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:14.876
<i> And down.</i>

01:00:14.876 --> 01:00:15.978
<i> And exhale.</i>

01:00:15.978 --> 01:00:18.847
<i> And down. Good,
 that's- we got forty.</i>

01:00:18.847 --> 01:00:21.717
<i>Almost there. Now thirty-nine.</i>

01:00:21.717 --> 01:00:24.152
<i> And thirty-eight.</i>

01:00:24.152 --> 01:00:26.088
<i> And release.</i>

01:00:26.088 --> 01:00:29.429
<i> Ease your way down. Oh.</i>

01:00:55.983 --> 01:00:59.157
<i> Mm. Ah. Mm.</i>

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.206
<i> Yes.</i>

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:20.478
<i> Ah, yes.</i>

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.980
<i> Mm, feels so good.</i>

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.117
<i> Mm. Mm. Ah! Ah.</i>

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.496
<i> Oh.</i>

01:01:41.496 --> 01:01:43.199
<i> Ah.</i>

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:46.836
<i> Ah, yes.</i>

01:01:48.836 --> 01:01:51.007
<i> Mm, so good.</i>

01:01:52.007 --> 01:01:53.510
<i> Ah.</i>

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.829
<i> Ah!</i>

01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:15.931
<i> Yes.</i>

01:02:15.931 --> 01:02:20.268
<i> Oh! And five,
 and suck, and suck.</i>

01:02:20.268 --> 01:02:22.271
<i> Lesson for Day Five.</i>

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.807
<i>- You are here for a reason.</i>

01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:27.543
<i> The reason is not your job.</i>

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:30.279
<i> The reason is not to eat.</i>

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:34.182
<i>God didn't put you here to gain
 weight, to turn to blubber,</i>

01:02:34.182 --> 01:02:38.353
<i> to be an obese, fat pig or
 a victim that gets attacked.</i>

01:02:39.353 --> 01:02:42.590
<i> Make sure to repeat this
 chant throughout the day.</i>

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:46.154
<i> Remember, you are
 here for a reason.</i>

01:03:12.154 --> 01:03:14.126
What did I tell you about
handling your business?

01:03:18.126 --> 01:03:18.195
Okay.

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:21.400
Okay, then.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.349
Are you sure?

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.090
Get out.

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:51.393
<i> You're doing good. And six.</i>

01:03:51.393 --> 01:03:55.197
<i>Feel that crease and your buns.</i>

01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:56.266
<i> Bun-</i>

01:03:58.266 --> 01:04:01.402
What the fuck? Wh- what the fuck
do you want? What are you doing?

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:07.010
Oh shit! Oh, shit, I'm s- I'm
sorry! Sorry, I- I- I- I'm- I'm
having monitor problems.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.112
I don't- I- I'm sorry.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:11.313
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:04:11.313 --> 01:04:12.416
Yeah.

01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:18.920
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.456
Yes, ma'am, I can hear
you. Can I have your
location, please?

01:04:21.456 --> 01:04:23.257
Uh, I- I- I don't know, um.

01:04:23.257 --> 01:04:25.927
I'm next to the
restroom in the mall.

01:04:25.927 --> 01:04:27.262
Okay, which mall?

01:04:27.262 --> 01:04:29.130
On La Cienega.

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:30.434
Thank you, one moment, please.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:38.407
Hi, this is dispatch at five,
zero, four, two, six.

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:43.144
I have a woman trapped
with a child in an elevator
at the Beverly Center.

01:04:43.144 --> 01:04:46.380
Uh, she's by the restrooms,
doesn't know exactly where.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.083
Uh, please make rounds.

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:49.351
<i> Ten four.</i>

01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:50.318
<i> Ma'am?</i>

01:04:50.318 --> 01:04:51.387
Uh, yeah, hello?

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:54.356
Hi, I have security in the
vicinity making rounds.

01:04:54.356 --> 01:04:56.425
Someone should be there shortly.

01:04:57.425 --> 01:04:58.726
Please be patient.

01:04:58.726 --> 01:05:01.329
Oh, oh. Thank you.

01:05:01.329 --> 01:05:02.998
How are you?

01:05:03.998 --> 01:05:05.168
What do you want?

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.137
Did I ever tell you the story
about my long lost love?

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:11.306
Gunther, I'm not in the mood
to hear one of your stories.

01:05:11.306 --> 01:05:14.175
I have a lady with a baby stuck.

01:05:14.175 --> 01:05:16.277
-Just listen.
-Gunther! I'm not-

01:05:16.277 --> 01:05:19.047
She was a- a very
sweet, sweet girl.

01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:23.050
-Gunther!
-Oh, and beautiful,
just beautiful.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:25.288
Uh, we met in college.

01:05:26.288 --> 01:05:31.126
I was studying business, and,
uh, she was studying science.

01:05:31.126 --> 01:05:35.197
She, uh, um, her dream was
to get into medical school.

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.766
Gunther, I'm sorry,
I'm not in the mood.

01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:38.103
Do you want a new job, Trina?

01:05:42.103 --> 01:05:44.440
From what Bernard has told me,
I guess you weren't always

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.079
a total piece of shit father.

01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:53.416
Actually, you were great.

01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:57.259
You were a great father.

01:06:04.259 --> 01:06:08.434
Bernard once told me
that his fifth birthday was
the happiest day of his life.

01:06:12.434 --> 01:06:14.503
You bought him his first bike.

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:16.407
Do you remember that day?

01:06:19.407 --> 01:06:20.094
I remember.

01:07:13.094 --> 01:07:16.233
I remember because
I never had a bike, and
I wanted him to have one.

01:07:18.233 --> 01:07:20.170
I remember working overtime
to buy him that bike.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:24.539
I wanted him to have
all the things I never had.

01:07:25.539 --> 01:07:27.576
I wanted him to be somebody.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.244
He could've been somebody.

01:07:30.244 --> 01:07:31.648
Bernard is smart.

01:07:32.648 --> 01:07:35.219
He's hardworking, had faith,
just like we raised him to be.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:38.722
He could've been anything.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:44.360
Me and Angela promised
ourselves we would
give him everything,

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.864
so he could become anything.

01:07:49.864 --> 01:07:53.338
So his kids could b- become
anything, and their kids.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:08:00.280
He went and chose
to become, become a...

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.351
I will never forgive him.

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:13.524
He's the one that broke up
the family and turned into
the worst kind of a sinner.

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:18.225
I don't know where I went wrong.

01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:23.367
So, um, Mr. Whatever
Your Name Is,

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.904
thanks for the trip
down memory lane.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.372
But that child
is no son of mine.

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:32.243
<i> Father,</i>

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:36.313
let me

01:08:38.313 --> 01:08:39.481
be

01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:42.453
who

01:08:47.453 --> 01:08:48.944
I-

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:09.675
Fuck!

01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:42.011
Whoa.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.587
That's it. That's it. Oh.

01:09:53.587 --> 01:09:55.390
Yeah.

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.393
Yeah. Fuck you.

01:09:58.393 --> 01:09:59.497
Oh shit.

01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:03.003
Oh.

01:10:09.003 --> 01:10:10.313
Oh.

01:10:18.313 --> 01:10:19.715
Hey dad.

01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:21.684
Yeah?

01:10:22.684 --> 01:10:23.622
Fuck you too.

01:10:28.622 --> 01:10:29.293
Man, I loved you.

01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:33.765
I fuckin' loved you, man.

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:39.435
It's cool, though. It's cool.

01:10:41.435 --> 01:10:43.373
I don't need you, obviously.
Look at me now!

01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:49.515
Look at me right fuckin' now!

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.422
Oh, shit!

01:11:01.422 --> 01:11:03.798
Oh, shit.

01:12:21.703 --> 01:12:22.743
Hm.

01:12:29.743 --> 01:12:32.448
Uh, stuck in an
elevator, and you...?

01:12:33.448 --> 01:12:35.649
Yeah, stuck in an elevator too.

01:12:35.649 --> 01:12:36.752
Mm-hm.

01:12:38.752 --> 01:12:40.488
I see you speak some Sotho.

01:12:40.488 --> 01:12:44.560
Yeah, only, only,
only the basics, man.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.628
-Yeah.
-Mm.

01:12:47.628 --> 01:12:49.663
My parents, being
in the struggle,

01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:53.935
thought it was important
that I knew as many African
languages as possible.

01:12:54.935 --> 01:12:56.172
Silly, really.

01:12:58.172 --> 01:13:00.507
No, not silly.

01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:01.610
You're South African.

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:04.713
Yeah.

01:13:06.713 --> 01:13:07.917
Mm.

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:11.220
Bretta, you're an African woman.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.954
Why do you go to these places?

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:15.824
What places, Sipho?

01:13:16.824 --> 01:13:20.930
Uh, every day, you're
speaking of, uh, meditating,

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.466
cleansing.

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:28.006
One day, you were even
talking of, uh, healings.

01:13:32.006 --> 01:13:35.811
If cleansing is what you need,
if healing is what you want,

01:13:37.811 --> 01:13:38.847
go home.

01:13:39.847 --> 01:13:41.550
Visit your father's grave.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:43.984
Pray to your ancestors.

01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:45.987
You'll be cleansed.

01:13:45.987 --> 01:13:47.256
You'll be healed.

01:13:49.256 --> 01:13:50.796
Go home.

01:13:55.796 --> 01:13:56.234
Home.

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.738
Home.

01:14:04.738 --> 01:14:05.707
Where was I?

01:14:06.707 --> 01:14:08.076
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:13.247
Um, we're supposed
to meet in front of the,
uh, library on campus.

01:14:13.247 --> 01:14:18.051
Um, but I got tied up in
class with my professor.

01:14:18.051 --> 01:14:20.054
Um, we're discussing my major.

01:14:20.054 --> 01:14:23.525
I- I respected him, just
wanted to know his opinion.

01:14:24.525 --> 01:14:27.695
Um, by the time I got to
the library, it was closed.

01:14:28.695 --> 01:14:32.002
It had gotten very late,
it was dark, there
was no one around.

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:37.805
So, I'm heading
back to the dorms.

01:14:37.805 --> 01:14:41.542
And I hear this rustling
in the bushes.

01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:51.685
No, don't touch me! Get away!

01:14:51.685 --> 01:14:54.893
Babe, it's me, it's
me, wha- oh, my God.

01:14:58.893 --> 01:15:00.296
You're bleeding.
What happened?

01:15:02.296 --> 01:15:08.036
Where were you? Don't touch
me! Where the fuck were you?

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.304
Oh, my God.

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:11.784
Oh, my God. Oh, my Go-

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:29.094
I was supposed to be her first.

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:34.801
I wasn't.

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:40.069
Oh.

01:15:42.069 --> 01:15:44.807
Well, wh- what happened
to her after that night?

01:15:46.807 --> 01:15:54.949
Um, she- she- she dropped
out of college after that, and
broke off our engagement.

01:15:55.949 --> 01:15:58.654
A year later, she called me.
She wanted to see me.

01:15:59.654 --> 01:16:01.889
Um, I hardly recognized her.

01:16:01.889 --> 01:16:05.126
I mean, the attack
completely changed her.

01:16:05.126 --> 01:16:07.761
She became a shut-in.

01:16:07.761 --> 01:16:12.065
She rarely left the
apartment, and she gained
a bunch of weight.

01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:14.869
I mean, it looked like a
hundred pounds to me.

01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:17.404
But I didn't care, though.

01:16:17.404 --> 01:16:19.877
I really didn't. She
was still so beautiful.

01:16:23.877 --> 01:16:32.720
She wanted to know where I
was, why I was so late, and,
um, why I didn't protect her.

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.390
She said it was my job to
protect her, and she...

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.795
I didn't know what
to say. I mean,

01:16:40.795 --> 01:16:42.997
I didn't save her.

01:16:42.997 --> 01:16:44.865
She's right, you know.

01:16:44.865 --> 01:16:47.801
No. You had no way of knowing.

01:16:47.801 --> 01:16:50.771
Did you tell her that?
That it wasn't your fault?

01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:52.172
No.

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:54.442
I never saw her
again after that.

01:16:54.442 --> 01:16:56.878
Well, not in person, anyways.

01:16:57.878 --> 01:17:00.814
You gave up on her?
You were engaged.

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:04.886
I don't know, she just-
she just didn't want
anything to do with me.

01:17:05.886 --> 01:17:07.954
Anything to do with that night.

01:17:07.954 --> 01:17:10.757
I was just an awful reminder,
that's what she said.

01:17:10.757 --> 01:17:12.163
An awful reminder.

01:17:16.163 --> 01:17:17.832
Do you still love her?

01:17:18.832 --> 01:17:22.170
Last I heard, she completely
changed her life.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:23.938
I mean, complete transformation.

01:17:23.938 --> 01:17:29.110
Lost all the weight,
um, became a fitness
guru, or some shit.

01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:31.847
Her name was Lola.

01:17:33.847 --> 01:17:38.118
Holy shit! I don't know
why I just told you all that.

01:17:38.118 --> 01:17:39.186
Oh, my God.

01:17:39.186 --> 01:17:41.189
Geez, Louise.

01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:42.256
Hilarious.

01:17:43.256 --> 01:17:46.728
What do you mean, she
became a fitness guru?

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:51.966
Last I heard, she,
she got some help,
lost all the weight, and I-

01:17:51.966 --> 01:17:54.101
got some DVDs or something, now.

01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:58.238
Apparently, everybody's doing
her- her- her, uh, workout.

01:17:58.238 --> 01:17:59.743
I don't know.

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:02.979
Oh.

01:18:04.979 --> 01:18:09.818
Um, you know what? Why don't
you- why don't you go ahead
and, uh, log off early today.

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:14.756
We- we've- we got
everything under control.
Just enjoy your weekend.

01:18:15.756 --> 01:18:16.492
Are you sure?

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.827
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:21.829
That- thanks for...

01:18:22.829 --> 01:18:23.864
Yeah.

01:18:23.864 --> 01:18:25.966
Oh, thanks.

01:18:25.966 --> 01:18:28.970
Why are you so-? Okay.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.104
Thank you.

01:18:31.104 --> 01:18:32.840
Okay.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.042
Bye.

01:18:35.042 --> 01:18:35.255
Bye.

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:49.524
<i> Welcome to Day Five.</i>

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.626
You made it through
another week.

01:18:51.626 --> 01:19:00.234
<i> Congratulations, all you super
 doers, super fighters, super
 kick ass, rockin' body babes.</i>

01:19:00.234 --> 01:19:05.907
<i> Today's focus
 are thighs and buns.</i>

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:08.208
<i> -So, let's ease our way down.
- </i> -<i> Thanks for calling  twenty-four hour Pizza Palace,</i>

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:09.777
<i> One moment, please.</i>

01:19:09.777 --> 01:19:15.048
<i> And get ready
 to do some serious,
 kick ass thigh blasters.</i>

01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:17.551
<i> Thanks for holding.
 May I take your order?</i>

01:19:17.551 --> 01:19:18.020
Yes, hi.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.956
<i> Hey, Trina.</i>

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:24.192
<i> Would you like your usual?
 Large pepperoni, extra cheese,
 side of garlic bread?</i>

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.860
- <i> You are  here for a reason.
</i> -Yes, thank you.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.563
<i> The reason is not your job.</i>

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:31.298
<i> The reason is not to eat.</i>

01:19:31.298 --> 01:19:35.569
<i>God didn't put you here to gain
 weight, to turn to blubber,</i>

01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:39.240
<i> to be an obese fat pig,
or a victim that gets attacked.</i>

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.876
<i> You are here for a reason.</i>

01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:45.179
<i> Repeat after me.
 I am here for a reason.</i>

01:19:45.179 --> 01:19:47.283
God made us all
in his perfection.

01:19:50.283 --> 01:19:52.921
God would never make a faggot.

01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:56.256
That kind of shit,
humans made up.

01:19:56.256 --> 01:19:59.962
But God made Bernard
in his perfection too.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.930
He would never choose this.

01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:08.404
Why, in- in the last year
of school, would he suddenly
choose to lose it all?

01:20:10.404 --> 01:20:12.042
Well, somebody chose.

01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:15.349
Yeah, the devil.

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.653
The devil's got a hold
of my son, Lord.

01:20:25.653 --> 01:20:27.657
Please, let him be delivered.

01:20:29.657 --> 01:20:31.360
You just gotta pray, son.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.231
He just needs the Lord, is all.

01:20:38.231 --> 01:20:39.403
Please, God.

01:20:42.403 --> 01:20:45.240
My son done turned gay
and with a white boy.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.110
Oh, Lord,

01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.448

01:24:46.579 --> 01:24:47.318
Liar!

01:24:51.318 --> 01:24:54.521
Oh Lola, let's see what
you have to say today.

01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:58.259
Oh, I know. Today's a new day.

01:24:58.259 --> 01:24:59.369
Mm.

01:25:09.369 --> 01:25:10.713
Bullshit!

01:25:20.713 --> 01:25:22.416
<i> Her name was Lola.</i>

01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:27.253
<i> God didn't put you
 here to gain weight,
 to turn to blubber,</i>

01:25:27.253 --> 01:25:30.557
<i> to be an obese fat pig,

<i> Her name was Lola.</i>

01:25:36.963 --> 01:25:38.632
<i> Her name was Lola.</i>

01:25:39.632 --> 01:25:41.969
Oh, yeah.

01:25:41.969 --> 01:25:45.608
Fucking Friday! What else?

01:25:47.608 --> 01:25:49.677
<i> You are not a victim.</i>

01:25:50.677 --> 01:25:52.554
<i> You are here for a reason.</i>

01:26:00.554 --> 01:26:03.990
<i> She became a shut-in.
She rarely left the apartment.</i>

01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:05.726
<i> The attack completely
 changed her.</i>

01:26:06.726 --> 01:26:08.296
Me too.

01:26:10.296 --> 01:26:11.731
Me too.

01:26:11.731 --> 01:26:14.601
Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

01:26:14.601 --> 01:26:18.319
Oh fuck. Oh fuck.

01:26:32.319 --> 01:26:33.587
Sorry, Lola.

01:26:34.587 --> 01:26:35.323
Sorry.

01:26:37.323 --> 01:26:38.393
Me too.

01:26:39.393 --> 01:26:41.631

<i> I know these bands are tight.</i>

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:23.737
<i> So tight.</i>

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:26.707
<i> But it feels amazing.</i>

01:27:26.707 --> 01:27:30.310
<i> These are non-victim,

01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:32.046

<i> Twenty, come on, do it,
 nineteen, eighteen.</i>

01:27:39.386 --> 01:27:45.492
<i> Oh, amazing, yes!
 And pull, and pull, pull.</i>

01:27:45.492 --> 01:27:48.729
<i>Open it up, and up, open it up.</i>

01:27:48.729 --> 01:27:49.762
<i> Squeeze it. Last five.</i>

-How are you feeling today?
-Crisis Lifeline.

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:10.853
This is Leon.

01:28:12.853 --> 01:28:14.654
You're not alone.

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:18.725
Crisis Lifeline.
This is Maria.
I am here to listen.

01:28:18.725 --> 01:28:20.765
It's never too
late to love, ma'am.

01:28:24.765 --> 01:28:26.570
So, why'd you come today?

01:28:32.872 --> 01:28:37.744
Crisis Lifeline.
This is Ken. I'm here to listen.

01:28:37.744 --> 01:28:39.113
Lifeline.

01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:40.414
I'm here.

01:28:40.414 --> 01:28:42.750

-  -I understand.

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.622

Crisis Lifeline. This is Leon.

01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:56.733
I know.

01:28:59.733 --> 01:29:00.512
What's going on?

01:29:41.774 --> 01:29:43.918
I think I was nine.

01:29:51.918 --> 01:29:54.524
- What else do
you remember?

01:29:57.524 --> 01:29:58.659
I don't know, it-

01:29:59.659 --> 01:30:00.894
It's okay.

01:30:00.894 --> 01:30:01.895
Okay.

01:30:02.895 --> 01:30:04.532
It was a good session.

01:30:05.532 --> 01:30:07.467
See you next week?

01:30:07.467 --> 01:30:08.601
Yes. Next week.

01:30:08.601 --> 01:30:09.936
Good.
