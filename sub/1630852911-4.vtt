09:17.644 --> 09:19.254
MARCUS IS PULLING
YOU BOYS INTO SHAPE.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.560
WHAT TIME ARE WE
MEETING MOM?

09:20.603 --> 09:22.562
MOM HAD TO WORK
LAST MINUTE.

09:22.605 --> 09:23.737
WE'LL SEE HER

09:52.461 --> 09:54.115
J.R., COME ON, MAN.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.857
COME ON, J.
COME ON, J.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.296
WHOO!

10:01.339 --> 10:03.733
WHOA. HEY.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.213
HEY, LET'S
CALL IT, MAN
I GOTTA

10:05.256 --> 10:07.128
SAVE SOMETHING
FOR THESE OLD GUYS.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.303
YOUNG MAN.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.915
YOU GOT
THE POTENTIAL

10:11.959 --> 10:14.178
TO BRING THIS TEAM
TO GREATNESS.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.310
SO, WE WILL
BACK YOU UP

10:15.353 --> 10:17.486
ANY WAY YOU NEED.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.009
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW
WE WERE HERE.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.971
HEY. YOU STILL
MAD AT ME?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.494
I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
AVOIDING ME LATELY.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.496
NOT AT ALL.
I HAVE JUST BEEN

10:27.539 --> 10:29.367
LIVING MY LIFE.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.459
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,
WRITING "MY BAD"

10:34.503 --> 10:36.679
ON A POST-IT
AND STICKING IT TO MY DOOR

10:36.723 --> 10:38.376
IS NOT HOW
YOU APOLOGIZE FOR

10:38.420 --> 10:40.204
THROWING MY ISSUES
WITH MY FATHER IN MY FACE

10:40.248 --> 10:42.424
AND THEN KICKING ME OUT.

10:42.467 --> 10:43.512
DO BETTER.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.430
SO?

10:50.475 --> 10:52.564
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

10:52.608 --> 10:54.044
I KNOW THIS WHOLE
ANEURYSM DIAGNOSIS

10:54.088 --> 10:55.524
WAS KIND OF A KICK
IN THE TEETH.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.917
IT'S ALL GOOD.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.701
THEY'RE HOLDING
MY SCHOLARSHIP.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.790
I JUST GOTTA GET
THIS SUCKER CLIPPED

11:00.834 --> 11:02.749
AND I'LL BE BACK
NEXT SEASON.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.273
WAIT. YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GETTING SURGERY?

11:05.316 --> 11:06.970
ALREADY GOT
MY SURGEON PICKED OUT
AND EVERYTHING.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.059
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE
TO DO THIS?

11:09.103 --> 11:10.887
YOUR DIAGNOSIS WAS ONLY
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.628
I THOUGHT THEY SAID
THE RISK OF RUPTURE
WAS LOW.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.934
AS LONG AS THIS THING
IS IN MY HEAD,

11:13.977 --> 11:15.892
I CAN'T PLAY FOOTBALL.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.328
SURGERY'S THE BEST OPTION.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.243
THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS
TO SURGERY, CAM.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.028
EXTENDED RECOVERY TIMES,

11:21.071 --> 11:24.945
STROKE, INFECTION,
SEIZURES, BLEEDING.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.903
ALL RIGHT, KEISHA, DAMN.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.600
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HATED MEDICINE.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.690
BRAIN SURGERY ISN'T
A DECISION TO MAKE LIGHTLY.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.256
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S MY DECISION,

11:32.300 --> 11:33.431
NOT YOURS.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.743
YO, DAMON, WHERE'D
YOU GET THAT ROUTINE

11:40.787 --> 11:41.875
WITH THE ROSIN BAG?

11:41.918 --> 11:43.180
YOU KNOW, THOSE
HAND TOSSES?

11:44.660 --> 11:46.488
I DON'T KNOW, BRUH.
I JUST DO WHAT
COMES NATURAL.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.063
YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT
REACHING OUT.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.455
NOT WITH HER MAN
IN TOWN.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.198
MAN, AIN'T NOBODY
CHECKING FOR SIMONE.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.765
OK.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.201
YOU THINK JORDAN WILL
COME TO THE FAMILY DINNER

12:04.245 --> 12:05.463
AT DR. PATTERSON'S?

12:05.507 --> 12:06.987
BRO, SHUT UP,
ALL RIGHT?

12:07.030 --> 12:08.640
LOOK, MAN, I'M JUST TRYING
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.120
YOU KNOW, WE NEED
TO HAVE A SIGNAL,

12:10.164 --> 12:11.687
'CAUSE IF I SEE YOU
STARTING TO GIVE SIMONE

12:11.731 --> 12:13.036
THOSE PUPPY DOG EYES,
I'M GONNA THROW

12:13.080 --> 12:14.255
A DINNER ROLL
AT YOUR HEAD.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.693
COME ON, MAN, I'M JUST
JOKING WITH YOU.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.348
I KNOW, MAN.
I JUST FORGOT THAT

12:20.391 --> 12:21.915
I HAD A LIT PAPER
DUE THIS AFTERNOON.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.092
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.920
HEY, POPS AND I ARE
CATCHING A BRAVES GAME.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.269
DON'T FORGET.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.010
WE GOT ANOTHER PRACTICE. 5 P.M.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.272
TONIGHT BEFORE
THE ALUMNI DINNER.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.490
YUP.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.767
SO, ARE YOU SURE
JORDAN IS OK

12:47.810 --> 12:49.943
WITH ALL OF THESE
DRASTIC CHANGES OF PLANS?

12:49.986 --> 12:51.596
BECAUSE GOING FROM
THE BACCHANALIA

12:51.640 --> 12:53.860
TO THE CAFETERIA IS
KIND OF A GLOW DOWN.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.514
WELL, I MEAN,
HE'S NOT THRILLED,

12:56.558 --> 12:58.995
BUT YOU KNOW,
HE'S AN ATHLETE, SO,

12:59.039 --> 13:01.041
HE GETS IT.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.304
SO, UM, YOU'VE KNOWN CAM

13:03.347 --> 13:04.784
FOR A WHILE, RIGHT?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.263
YEAH. SINCE JUNIOR YEAR.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.874
HAS HE ALWAYS BEEN
THIS HARD-HEADED?

13:09.876 --> 13:12.792
I'M SORRY.
WHAT IS THIS

13:12.835 --> 13:14.706
DEEP DIVE INTO
CAM'S PSYCHE?

13:14.750 --> 13:15.969
THOUGHT YOU TWO WERE
JUST HOOKING UP.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.405
WELL, I MEAN, YES, WE ARE.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.972
-MM-HMM.
-I'M LITERALLY JUST CURIOUS.

13:19.015 --> 13:21.191
HMM. THAT'S FUNNY.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.845
SEE, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WEREN'T INTO SPORTS,

13:22.889 --> 13:24.238
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU ARE

13:24.281 --> 13:25.892
CATCHING FEELINGS.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.632
I JUST FIND IT
VERY INTERESTING.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.244
OH, OH, REALLY? BECAUSE
I COULD TALK ABOUT YOU

13:30.287 --> 13:33.508
CATCHING FEELINGS FOR
A CERTAIN BASEBALL PITCHER.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.075
-OH!
-BUT I'MMA KEEP IT CUTE.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.381
GOOD. BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING GOING ON.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.298
KEISHA, I'M SERIOUS.
WE HAD A CONVERSATION

13:41.342 --> 13:43.605
AND EVERYTHING'S FINE NOW.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.172
SURE. MM-HMM.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.133
YO, POPS,
WE GOTTA GET GOING.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.526
TRAFFIC AROUND THE PARK
IS GETTING CRAZY.

13:51.569 --> 13:52.788
J.R., I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO

13:52.832 --> 13:53.963
SKIP THE GAME
THIS TIME AROUND.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.356
SKIP THE GAME?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:55.399 --> 13:56.748
THIS MORNING, I WAS
TALKING TO MARCUS

13:56.792 --> 13:58.446
AND SOME OF THE DUDES
ABOUT OLD TIMES

13:58.489 --> 14:00.709
AND WE THOUGHT
WE'D HIT UP
TITO'S, OUR OLD HANGOUT.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.189
DAD, WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT GOING TO
THE BRAVES GAME FOR WEEKS.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.625
I'D BOW OUT BUT
EVERYBODY'S GOING

14:03.668 --> 14:05.453
AND I SAID I'D DRIVE.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE

14:05.496 --> 14:06.933
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
TO THE GAME

14:06.976 --> 14:08.804
AND I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT
AT THE DINNER. HUH?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.676
I GUESS. UM...
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.957
THEY AIN'T WORKED OUT
LIKE THAT IN A MINUTE.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.005
GOOD MINUTE.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.093
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.533
THE HISTORY OF
HBCU ATHLETICS

15:25.576 --> 15:27.622
TRACES BACK
TO THE NEGRO LEAGUES.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.537
FOR GENERATIONS, BLACK ATHLETES

15:29.580 --> 15:30.930
HAVE SOUGHT OUT AN ENVIRONMENT

15:30.973 --> 15:32.061
THAT NURTURES THEIR TALENTS

15:32.105 --> 15:34.368
BOTH ON AND OFF THE FIELD,

15:34.411 --> 15:37.719
INCLUDING SOME OF BRINGSTON'S
OWN SHINING STARS.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.982
THROUGHOUT THE WIDER
HBCU COMMUNITY,

15:40.026 --> 15:43.159
SPORTS GREATS SUCH AS
WALTER PAYTON AND JERRY RICE,

15:43.203 --> 15:46.380
ANDRE DAWSON AND ALTHEA GIBSON
HAVE GRACED THE HALLS

15:46.423 --> 15:48.121
AND CONTRIBUTED TO
THE RICH HERITAGE

15:48.164 --> 15:50.384
OF HBCU ATHLETICS.

AMARA.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.277
HERE'S A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.018
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D
BE HERE TONIGHT.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.367
YEAH, WELL, I USED TO
PLAY POINT GUARD

16:17.411 --> 16:19.239
ON THE BASKETBALL
TEAM HERE.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.371
I'M GLAD YOU CAUGHT ME.
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO HEAD OUT.

16:21.415 --> 16:24.766
UH...HAVE YOU GIVEN
MORE THOUGHT

16:24.809 --> 16:26.550
TO THE ARTICLE
I PITCHED YOU?

16:26.594 --> 16:28.030
ABOUT SOMETHING BEING UP
WITH BRINGSTON'S FINANCES?

16:28.074 --> 16:30.076
I THINK THE SCHOOL MAY
BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.599
YEAH, I THINK YOU MIGHT
BE ON TO SOMETHING.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.470
I NEED TO DO
MORE RESEARCH.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.081
WELL, SWING BY
THE OFFICE NEXT WEEK.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.865
OH. GREAT.
IT'S A DATE.

16:36.908 --> 16:40.390
NO. WHEN I TAKE YOU OUT
ON A DATE, AMARA,

OH, OK.
YOUNG BLOOD.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.942
SLICK SUIT.
I SEE YOU, PLAYER.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.901
UM, I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.294
-ALL RIGHT.
-AFTER YOU.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.732
YEAH. OK.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.304
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW
I STILL HAD YOUR

17:24.347 --> 17:25.957
MINOR LEAGUE CARD.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.307
WHAT? THAT WAS YOU?

17:29.439 --> 17:30.614
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT
CARD WAS GONNA BE WORTH

17:30.658 --> 17:32.094
BIG MONEY SOMEDAY.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.923
LOOK HERE, MAN, I'M SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.055
WHAT HAPPENED
ANYWAY, MAN?

17:36.098 --> 17:37.404
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE YOU'RE

17:37.447 --> 17:38.405
KILLING IT IN
THE MINORS AND THE NEXT,

17:38.448 --> 17:39.971
YOU'RE JUST OUT.

17:40.015 --> 17:42.104
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I HURT MY LEG, JESSE.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.584
YOU KNOW THAT.
COME ON, NOW.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.151
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
THEY COULD DO?

17:45.194 --> 17:46.978
ALL THESE PROCEDURES
OUT HERE?

17:48.154 --> 17:50.678
THAT WAS A LONG TIME
AGO, JESSE, ALL RIGHT?

17:50.721 --> 17:51.940
I DON'T LIKE
TO LOOK BACKWARDS.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.293
ENJOY YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.818
THIS IS FROM
THAT THANKSGIVING

18:00.862 --> 18:02.994
WHEN YOU TOOK ME HOME
TO YOUR FAMILY IN BROOKLYN.

18:03.038 --> 18:06.563
MY DAD HAD THE BEST TIME
MESSING WITH YOU.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.652
WHAT YOU DO WITH
THEM SHOES IN THE HOUSE?

18:08.696 --> 18:10.263
YOU NO HAVE GOOD SENSE?

18:12.961 --> 18:14.354
EVERYONE IN OUR YEAR

18:14.397 --> 18:15.833
JUST KNEW YOU AND MARCUS

18:15.877 --> 18:17.270
WERE GONNA BE THAT
FOREVER COUPLE.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.619
SO, WHAT WENT WRONG
WITH YOU TWO?

18:18.662 --> 18:20.273
COME ON.
SPILL THE REAL TEA.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.627
JORDAN. IT IS SO
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.281
I WANNA HEAR
ALL ABOUT SCHOOL.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.760
IT'S PRETTY GREAT,
ACTUALLY, EVEN WITH

18:29.804 --> 18:31.284
FOOTBALL KICKING MY BUTT.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.286
HAS YOUR AUNTIE
SHOWN YOU THIS?

18:33.329 --> 18:36.854
OH! NO,
AND I NEED A COPY.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.160
LOOK HOW CUTE YOU ARE!

18:38.204 --> 18:39.335
OK.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.815
NO NEED
TO OVERSHARE.

18:40.858 --> 18:41.946
WE WERE ROLLING TO
ALL THE PARTIES

18:41.990 --> 18:43.426
WITH SO MUCH SWAGGER.

18:43.470 --> 18:47.952
YEE!

18:47.996 --> 18:50.781
WHEN AMARA
TOOK THAT SEMESTER OFF
SOPHOMORE YEAR,

18:50.825 --> 18:52.218
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MYSELF.

18:52.261 --> 18:53.610
AUNTIE, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

18:53.654 --> 18:54.785
YOU TOOK A SEMESTER OFF.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.831
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
JUST SOME

18:56.874 --> 18:59.529
PERSONAL ISSUES I NEEDED
TO HANDLE. AHEM.

18:59.573 --> 19:00.922
UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

19:00.965 --> 19:02.445
I'M GONNA GO TO
THE LADIES' ROOM.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.150
YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING

19:11.193 --> 19:12.455
TO WORRY ABOUT
THERE, RIGHT?

19:12.499 --> 19:13.761
AM I THAT OBVIOUS?

19:13.804 --> 19:15.241
LOOK, LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIPS

19:15.284 --> 19:16.981
CAN BE TOUGH,

19:17.025 --> 19:18.461
BUT AS LONG AS
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE

19:18.505 --> 19:21.029
TRUST AND COMMUNICATION,
YOU WILL BE FINE.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.422
SHE REALLY DOES
SEEM TO LOVE IT HERE,

19:22.465 --> 19:24.511
AND YOU'RE A HUGE
PART OF THAT.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.121
SHE DOES LOVE IT HERE.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.297
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS JUGGLING
A LOT EARLY ON,

19:28.341 --> 19:30.343
TRYING TO ADJUST
TO EVERYTHING.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.083
HONESTLY, I THINK THAT
PANIC ATTACK SHE HAD

19:32.127 --> 19:34.390
A FEW WEEKS BACK WAS
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.131
SHE REALIZED
SHE NEEDED TO PAUSE

19:36.175 --> 19:37.393
AND GET PERSPECTIVE.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.310
RIGHT. UM, WOULD YOU
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND?

19:41.354 --> 19:42.790
YEAH.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.226
HIS PARENTS ARE
BRINGSTON ALUM

19:44.270 --> 19:45.575
AND THE TIMELINE WORKS.

19:45.619 --> 19:46.968
MY AUNT NEVER
MENTIONED THAT

19:47.011 --> 19:48.709
SHE TOOK A SEMESTER
OFF, EVER.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.493
SHE TOOK TIME OFF
TO GIVE BIRTH, RIGHT?

19:50.537 --> 19:52.365
IT IS SUSPICIOUS,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.105
MY POP'S BEEN
ACTING WEIRD, TOO.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.586
AT PRACTICE,
HE AND DAMON, IT WAS LIKE

19:56.630 --> 19:58.501
WATCHING DAD AND HIS
YOUNGER SELF.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.373
THE WAY THEY PREP
THEIR HANDS,

20:00.416 --> 20:02.026
THEIR PITCHING STANCES.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.159
THEY DAMN NEAR
MIRROR IMAGES.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.423
LOOK. IT'S LIKE THEY GOT
A INSTANT BOND.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.772
ALMOST LIKE DAMON
IS THE SON

20:08.816 --> 20:10.034
MY DAD WISHED HE HAD.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.822
J.R., ARE YOU READY
FOR THE POSSIBILITY

20:14.865 --> 20:16.563
THAT DAMON COULD BE
YOUR BROTHER?

20:16.606 --> 20:18.304
I DON'T KNOW.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.827
I'M NOT READY TO BE
IN DAMON'S SHADOW

20:19.870 --> 20:22.133
AS A BASEBALL PLAYER
AND A SON.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.700
SIMONE, CAN I
TALK TO YOU?

20:28.401 --> 20:30.359
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU HAD A PANIC ATTACK?

20:30.403 --> 20:33.144
I HANDLED IT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.929
SIMONE, IT IS
A BIG DEAL, ALL RIGHT?

20:34.972 --> 20:36.322
SOMETHING MAJOR
HAPPENED TO YOU.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.193
I WASN'T HERE AND YOU
KEPT IT A SECRET.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.282
JORDAN, I DIDN'T KEEP IT
A SECRET FROM YOU.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.979
I--I DIDN'T WANT MY

20:42.023 --> 20:44.155
ISSUES TO BRING YOU DOWN.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.809
I'M TRYING TO BE AN ADULT
AND I CAN'T JUST

20:45.853 --> 20:47.594
LEAN ON YOU EVERY TIME
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:47.637 --> 20:48.856
DID YOU LEAN ON DAMON?

20:50.510 --> 20:52.555
JORDAN, HE HAPPENED
TO BE THERE.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.165
SIMONE, WHAT IS GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

20:54.209 --> 20:55.428
AND DON'T SAY NOTHING.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.473
I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT
I PROMISE YOU,

20:57.517 --> 20:59.040
JORDAN, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH US.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.259
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.912
SIMONE, I WANT
TO TRUST YOU.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.914
I REALLY DO, BUT YOU'RE
MAKING IT REALLY DIFFICULT.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.002
-OK, WELL, J--
-NO.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.656
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TIRED.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.397
AND I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO THE HOTEL ROOM.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.100
SO, YOU QUIT
WEIGHT TRAINING,

21:16.144 --> 21:17.014
SKIP OUT ON PRACTICE COMPLETELY,

21:17.058 --> 21:18.755
AND THEN YOU SHOW UP
TO THE DINNER

21:18.799 --> 21:20.888
WITH SOME
GROUPIE WANNABE?

21:20.931 --> 21:23.282
COME ON, MAN.
ERICA'S COOL, BRO.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.805
COME ON, MAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

21:26.720 --> 21:27.982
YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST DEALING

21:28.025 --> 21:29.070
WITH SOME
PERSONAL STUFF.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.987
YO, WAIT,
THIS ABOUT SIMONE?

21:33.030 --> 21:34.858
DAWG, SHE GOT
A BOYFRIEND.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.600
THAT MEANS SHE UNAVAILABLE
TO YOU AND ME.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.472
HELL, FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE COULD BE YOUR--

21:44.390 --> 21:46.653
SHE COULD BE WHAT? J.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.961
YOU SEE, YOU KEEP
SAYING THAT YOU'RE
NOT KEEPING SECRETS

21:51.005 --> 21:53.094
BUT THE MATH
AIN'T MATHING.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.835
ALL THE--THE VAGUENESS
AND DODGING.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.967
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S TELLING ME?

21:57.011 --> 21:58.404
THAT YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING FROM ME.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.622
LOOK, STOP OBSESSING

21:59.666 --> 22:01.058
AND GET YOUR HEAD
IN THE GAME.

22:01.102 --> 22:03.365
THERE MAY NOT
BE A GAME

22:03.409 --> 22:04.932
TODAY, Y'ALL.

22:04.975 --> 22:08.588
DESMOND STEWART
GOT HIS DRINK ON LAST NIGHT.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.111
NOW HE'S TOO
HUNG OVER TO PLAY.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.417
SO, WE NEED
TO FIND A NINTH MAN

22:11.460 --> 22:13.419
OR WE FORFEIT THE GAME.

22:13.462 --> 22:14.855
COACH,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

22:14.898 --> 22:16.291
THERE GOTTA BE SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO.

22:21.209 --> 22:22.863
DOES THE PLAYER
GOTTA BE AN ALUM?

22:22.906 --> 22:24.125
LOOK, I DON'T CARE IF
IT'S THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG

22:24.168 --> 22:25.300
AS LONG AS HE CAN
GET SUITED UP

22:25.344 --> 22:26.910
WITHIN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.

22:29.652 --> 22:30.914
FOLLOW ME, FELLAS.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.702
YO, CAM.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.138

22:37.181 --> 22:39.096
BASEBALL'S SO EASY

22:39.140 --> 22:41.403
HOW ABOUT YOU PLAY TODAY?

22:41.447 --> 22:42.883
AIN'T NOBODY GOT
TIME FOR THAT.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.452
ALL RIGHT.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.542
MY BAD, FELLAS.
I GUESS HE'S

22:49.585 --> 22:51.239
NOT AS GOOD AS
HE CLAIMS TO BE.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.199
HEY, YO, SIMS.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.857
LET'S SUIT UP
THEN, PLAYER.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.777

23:10.040 --> 23:11.346

23:11.390 --> 23:13.783
WELL, THIS SEEMS
LIKE AN EASY WIN.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.263
WHAT SHE WANTS
YOU TO THINK.

23:15.306 --> 23:16.525
HEY, GRANNY.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.179
THEA.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.746
I MISSED YOU
AT THE DINNER.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.791
THE ONLY STUDENT
NOT THERE, APPARENTLY.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.706
YEAH, I WAS RESTING UP
FOR THE MATCH.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.709
AND YOU, MY DEAR.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.885
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED
BY THE CLIP I SAW

23:28.929 --> 23:30.452
OF YOUR QUEEN OF
THE COURT PERFORMANCE.

23:30.496 --> 23:33.673
OH, WOW.
THANK YOU.

23:33.716 --> 23:36.676
I LIKE TO COMPETE
AGAINST THE BEST.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.330
AND TODAY, THAT IS
CLEARLY YOU TWO.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.032
WELL. YOU FAILED
TO MENTION

23:45.075 --> 23:48.470
THAT THE SPECIAL
ALUMNI DONOR
IS YOUR GRANDMA.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.429
YEAH. WELL, I
DIDN'T WANT YOU TO

23:50.472 --> 23:51.865
NOT TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

23:51.908 --> 23:52.996
GRANNY MAYS
IS NO JOKE.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.128
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

23:57.392 --> 23:58.828
HEY.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.439
I'M GLAD YOU
COULD MAKE IT.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.701
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WOULD COME.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.137
I WOULDN'T MISS THIS
FOR THE WORLD.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.662
LOOK, ABOUT YESTERDAY.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.143
NO, NO. WE CAN TALK

24:09.186 --> 24:11.101
ALL RIGHT?
BUT RIGHT NOW,

TO TEACH YOU HOW
TO PITCH, TOO?

27:07.669 --> 27:09.192
15 SERVING 40.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.716
THEA MAYS AND SIMONE HICKS

27:10.759 --> 27:12.152
ARE GONNA TRY AND HANG ON.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.588
THIS WILL BE FOR THE MATCH.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.766
-GOT IT, GOT IT!
-I GOT IT!

27:19.072 --> 27:20.247
OH!

27:22.597 --> 27:24.164
THAT'S GAME, SET, MATCH

27:24.207 --> 27:26.253
FOR MRS. MAYS AND MRS. ALBERTA.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.386
J.R.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.302
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOT YOU ALL RILED UP.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.347
EVERYTHING'S ALL GOOD.

27:33.390 --> 27:34.348
SO, TELL ME.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.219
WHY'D YOU LIE TO ME?

27:36.263 --> 27:38.613
-I DIDN'T LIE TO YOU.
-STOP IT, POPS.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.310
YOU'VE BEEN
HIDING AND AVOIDING
SINCE YOU GOT HERE

27:40.354 --> 27:41.747
AND I'M TIRED OF IT.

27:41.790 --> 27:42.965
LOOK, I WAS SO EXCITED ON

27:43.009 --> 27:45.315
PLAYING IN THIS GAME
WITH YOU.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.056
NOW I JUST WISH YOU
WOULD'VE STAYED IN MACON.

28:15.128 --> 28:19.306
LOOK...I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY, BRO.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.699
I SAID I'D HAVE
YOUR BACK OUT THERE

28:20.742 --> 28:22.657
AND I DIDN'T.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.354
THAT'S MY BAD.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.530
I GUESS I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE DISTRACTED MYSELF.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.145
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON

28:32.188 --> 28:34.930
WITH YOU AND YOUR POPS.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.411
BUT WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU GOTTA TALK IT OUT

28:37.454 --> 28:38.804
AND WORK THROUGH IT.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.240
I CAN'T TALK
TO MY POPS ABOUT

28:40.283 --> 28:42.155
NOTHING THAT'S GOING
ON IN MY LIFE, MAN,

28:42.198 --> 28:43.417
AND I WISH I COULD.

28:44.810 --> 28:45.898
BUT YOU CAN.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.336
THAT'S A BLESSING, BRO.

28:50.903 --> 28:51.947
THANKS.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.430
I GUESS I BLEW IT
AS BEING COACH, HUH?

28:56.473 --> 29:01.522
IT HASN'T BEEN YOUR
SHINING MOMENT.

29:01.565 --> 29:04.307
LOOK, MAN, THIS GAME
AIN'T OVER YET.

29:04.351 --> 29:07.180
IF ME AND YOU
PULL TOGETHER,

29:07.223 --> 29:09.312
I'M TELLING YOU WE CAN
MAKE SOME MAGIC HAPPEN.

29:09.356 --> 29:12.359
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YOU IN?

29:13.621 --> 29:14.796

29:14.840 --> 29:15.841

I HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU

30:20.296 --> 30:22.081
ABOUT DAMON.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.127
HUH.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.912
THERE'S THIS
CHANCE THAT

30:26.955 --> 30:29.828
MY AUNT HAD A BABY
18 YEARS AGO AND...

30:31.525 --> 30:34.006
THAT SAID BABY
IS DAMON.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.877
WHOA. WHAT?

30:35.921 --> 30:37.270
I WAS TRYING
TO WAIT TILL I

30:37.313 --> 30:39.359
FOUND OUT MORE
BEFORE I TOLD ANYONE

30:39.402 --> 30:40.969
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO KEEP IT FROM YOU, BUT

30:41.013 --> 30:43.450
JORDAN, IF IT IS TRUE,

30:43.493 --> 30:46.366
IT'S MY AUNT AND DAMON'S
SECRET TO TELL, NOT MINE.

30:47.628 --> 30:48.890
I MEAN, DAMON DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW I'M

30:48.934 --> 30:50.500
LOOKING INTO ALL THIS.

30:51.675 --> 30:52.894
JORDAN, THIS IS
NOT FUNNY.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.113
NO, I KNOW.

30:54.156 --> 30:55.941
I KNOW, I JUST--
I REALLY THOUGHT

30:55.984 --> 30:57.725
YOU WERE ABOUT TO
BREAK UP WITH ME JUST NOW.

30:57.768 --> 31:00.119
-BOY, PLEASE.
-OH, COME ON.

31:00.162 --> 31:02.077
YOU AIN'T GETTING RID
OF ME THAT EASY.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.733
BUT I DO NEED YOU
TO KEEP IT

31:05.776 --> 31:07.735
TO YOURSELF
FOR A WHILE.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.693
OF COURSE.
FOR SURE.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.565
BUT SIMONE,
I DON'T KNOW.

31:11.608 --> 31:12.958
I THINK THAT YOU
SHOULD TELL YOUR AUNT.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.657
I MEAN, IF YOU
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
BABY SHAY WAS, RIGHT,

31:16.700 --> 31:18.485
AND SOMEBODY CLOSE TO
YOU HAD INFORMATION,

31:18.528 --> 31:19.529
WOULDN'T YOU
WANT TO KNOW?

31:19.573 --> 31:20.661
OF COURSE I WOULD.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.056
BUT ADOPTION,
THAT'S PERSONAL.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.146
AND DAMON SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.843
WHAT IF MY AUNT DOESN'T
WANT TO, EITHER?

31:31.541 --> 31:33.848
THE BEST THING YOU CAN
DO IS TRUST YOUR HEART.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.937
ALL RIGHT?

31:35.981 --> 31:39.985
-YEAH.
-YEAH. AHH.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.377
OK, WHAT IS
SO FUNNY NOW?

31:41.421 --> 31:43.640
NOTHING. NOTHING.
IT'S JUST--

31:43.684 --> 31:45.860
SO, DAMON MIGHT
BE YOUR COUSIN.

31:45.904 --> 31:46.905
-OK.
-HUH?

31:46.948 --> 31:48.210
SHUT--SHUT UP.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.255
YOUR COUSIN.
OK, FINE.

31:49.298 --> 31:50.430
WHATEVER.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.266
CAM CAM.
WHAT YOU STILL
DOING HERE, BOY?

32:00.309 --> 32:02.485
IF THIS IS ABOUT
LOSING THE GAME, MAN,

32:02.529 --> 32:03.965
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE DOWN ABOUT.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.750
NAH, COACH, IT'S, UM...

32:06.794 --> 32:07.969
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GAME.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.275
LISTEN, LISTEN.

32:12.060 --> 32:15.542
WHEN COACH MILLS
CLEARED YOU TO PLAY,

32:15.585 --> 32:18.762
HE TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR WHOLE SITUATION, MAN.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.242
SO, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.943
I DON'T KNOW, COACH.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.814
TODAY JUST
REMINDED ME HOW MUCH

32:26.857 --> 32:28.642
I MISS PLAYING,
YOU KNOW?

32:28.685 --> 32:30.949
LIKE, I'VE PLAYED SPORTS
MY WHOLE LIFE.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.341
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'D DO WITHOUT IT.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.518
WHEN I WAS IN
THE MINOR LEAGUES...

32:38.913 --> 32:41.263
I WOULD'VE DONE
ANYTHING, ANYTHING,

32:41.307 --> 32:45.050
MAN, TO STAY IN THE GAME,
'CAUSE I LOVED IT.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.790
I DID SOME THINGS
THAT HAVE--

32:46.834 --> 32:50.142
THAT HAVE LOST ME
EVERYTHING,

32:50.185 --> 32:54.233
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHEN TO WALK AWAY.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.365
WORD ON THE STREET IS
YOU CRACKED.

32:56.409 --> 32:59.368
I CRACKED. OK.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.501
WELL, WORD
ON THE STREET

33:01.544 --> 33:02.937
ISN'T ALWAYS THE TRUTH.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.374
LOOK, MAN.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.421
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU GONNA DO

33:08.464 --> 33:11.424
OUTSIDE OF SPORTS,
ALL RIGHT?

33:11.467 --> 33:13.339
AND WHAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.905
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
PICK YOUR HEAD UP.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.081
COME ON, NOW.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.908
THANKS, COACH.

33:17.952 --> 33:18.997
ALL RIGHT.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.087
BECAUSE DAMON'S
BIRTH PARENTS,

33:22.130 --> 33:23.566
THEY WENT TO BRINGSTON,

33:23.610 --> 33:25.133
AND--AND IT WAS
JUST THE TIMELINE.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.266
YOUR TIMELINE
LINES UP PERFECTLY

33:27.309 --> 33:28.745
WITH YOUR SEMESTER AWAY,
AND THEN

33:28.789 --> 33:30.182
THE WAY YOU TALKED
ABOUT HOW THINGS

33:30.225 --> 33:31.226
WENT WRONG WITH
COACH MARCUS.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.488
YOU WERE JUST--AUNTIE,

33:32.532 --> 33:33.620
YOU WERE SO TIGHT-LIPPED,

33:33.663 --> 33:34.621
SO, I JUST--

33:39.278 --> 33:42.063
GIRL! YOU NEED TO SIGN UP

33:42.107 --> 33:44.500
FOR SOME CREATIVE
WRITING CLASSES.

33:44.544 --> 33:47.025
LET ME REASSURE
YOU THAT, NO,

33:47.068 --> 33:48.896
I WAS NOT PREGNANT
IN COLLEGE

33:48.939 --> 33:52.378
AND NO, I AM NOT
DAMON'S BIRTH MOTHER.

33:52.421 --> 33:53.466
GOT IT?

33:54.771 --> 33:55.816
GOT IT.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.994
WHOO!

34:00.038 --> 34:01.430
I REALLY THOUGHT
FOR A SECOND THERE

34:01.474 --> 34:04.085
DAMON WAS FAMILY!

34:04.129 --> 34:06.305
WHOO.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.046
AND HOW ARE THINGS
WITH JORDAN?

34:10.483 --> 34:13.964
WE'RE GOOD...NOW.

34:15.401 --> 34:18.404
AND SPEAKING OF
THE DEVIL, HE'S OUTSIDE.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.015
HE'S TAKING ME TO A NICE
CANDLELIGHT DINNER.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.539
OK, FANCY.
HAVE FUN.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.063
-LOVE YOU.
-LOVE YOU, TOO.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.725
-HEY.
-HMM.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.077
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

34:39.120 --> 34:41.296
WELL, I'M THINKING HOW

34:41.340 --> 34:42.689
I'M GONNA SMUGGLE YOU
OUT OF HERE

34:42.732 --> 34:44.256
SO KEISHA
WON'T CATCH US.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.433
NO.

34:48.738 --> 34:52.090
IN ALL HONESTY,
I AM THINKING

34:52.133 --> 34:56.877
ABOUT HOW LUCKY I AM,
AND DUMB...

34:56.920 --> 34:59.662
AND HOW...I ALMOST LOST

34:59.706 --> 35:01.751
THE BEST THING IN MY LIFE.

35:01.795 --> 35:04.014
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE NOT DUMB.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.495
-THANK YOU.
-COME HERE.

35:06.539 --> 35:09.455
ALL RIGHT.
AND SECONDLY,

35:09.498 --> 35:11.805
YOUR AUNTIE IS
RIGHT, SIMONE.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.067
I MEAN, AS LONG
AS WE HAVE

35:13.111 --> 35:16.288
OPEN COMMUNICATION
AND HONESTY,

35:16.331 --> 35:18.855
WE MIGHT JUST BE ABLE
TO MAKE THIS THING WORK.

35:18.899 --> 35:21.075
WELL, MY AUNTIE IS WISE.

35:22.381 --> 35:23.904
BUT...

35:23.947 --> 35:26.167
-OH.
-MM.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.386
MM.

35:30.215 --> 35:33.305
COUSIN OR NO COUSIN...

35:35.742 --> 35:38.005
DAMON IS MY FRIEND.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.963
AND I NEED YOU TO BE
OK WITH THAT.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.187
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BE.

35:46.231 --> 35:50.060
GOOD. BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU.

35:50.104 --> 35:53.586
MM-HMM. GOOD.
I LOVE YOU.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.110
♪ I'M IN LOVE,
I'M IN LOVE ♪

35:56.154 --> 36:00.636
♪ WITH YOU, WITH YOU, YEAH

36:06.381 --> 36:07.513
MARCUS.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.994
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
WITH RALPH LAST NIGHT?

36:11.038 --> 36:12.822
I WAS JUST CHECKING
THE BROTHER.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.998
HE SEEMS A LITTLE YOUNG,
DON'T YOU THINK?

36:15.042 --> 36:17.523
WHY DO YOU CARE?
MARCUS...

36:20.221 --> 36:23.442
LOOK, I--I NEED
A STRAIGHT ANSWER

36:23.485 --> 36:25.574
FROM YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

36:25.618 --> 36:28.055
-OK.
-I NEED TO KNOW

36:28.098 --> 36:29.665
WHAT HAPPENED TO US.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.276
AFTER YOU LEFT FOR
THE MINORS, YOU JUST

36:31.319 --> 36:32.799
ENDED OUR RELATIONSHIP

36:32.842 --> 36:35.323
AND I NEVER GOT
AN EXPLANATION WHY.

36:35.367 --> 36:39.414
AMARA, THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.024
LOOK, WE WERE
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.073
CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE
ALL THAT IN THE PAST?

36:59.782 --> 37:01.915
HEY.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.178
LOOK, I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

37:04.222 --> 37:07.790
I DECIDED TO HOLD OFF
ON SURGERY FOR NOW.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.270
I THINK I NEED
A LITTLE MORE TIME

37:09.314 --> 37:12.186
AND MAYBE TALK IT OVER
WITH MY PARENTS.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.624
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT
YOU GOT SOME SENSE.

37:17.887 --> 37:21.064
BUT YOU WERE AN ASS
TO ME, CAM, TWICE,

37:21.108 --> 37:22.501
WHEN I WAS JUST
TRYING TO BE HELPFUL,

37:22.544 --> 37:23.937
SO, I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO WASTE

37:23.980 --> 37:25.286
ANY MORE OF MY TIME
WITH AN ASS.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.636
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.771
AND TO BE HONEST,
I DID

37:31.814 --> 37:33.512
REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP.

37:33.555 --> 37:35.601
YOUR ADVICE
WASN'T TERRIBLE.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.257
AND I WAS COMPLETELY
AN ASS.

37:42.869 --> 37:47.134
SO, DO YOU...
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

37:48.396 --> 37:50.485
I THOUGHT WE JUST DID.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.532
SO, YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANNA SPEND

37:53.575 --> 37:55.534
A LITTLE MORE TIME
WITH THIS ASS?

37:57.362 --> 37:59.494
YOU'RE CORNY AND YOU
PLAY TOO MUCH.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.322
COME HERE...

38:26.739 --> 38:28.784
SNEAKING BOYS INTO
THE GIRLS' SIDE OF THE DORM.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.700
HMM. IT'S A SERIOUS
VIOLATION OF THE RULES.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.486
LUCKILY, I DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING.

38:34.529 --> 38:36.139
IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING
WORKED OUT, HUH?

38:45.497 --> 38:47.673
SO, HOW WAS THE GAME?

38:47.716 --> 38:50.763

ACTUALLY CLOSE.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.634
-MM-HMM.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.244
WE PULLED IT OUT.

38:56.899 --> 39:00.642
OH. MAN, IT REALLY
SUCKED, LIKE

39:00.686 --> 39:03.819
NOT HAVING YOU AROUND
TO TALK TO THIS WEEKEND.

39:03.863 --> 39:08.128
DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
I RELY ON YOU.

39:08.171 --> 39:11.087
YEAH. I RELY

39:12.567 --> 39:13.612

39:16.179 --> 39:19.182
SO...LAY IT ON ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:20.836 --> 39:24.405
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS A HEAD TRIP,

39:24.449 --> 39:27.974
BEING SURROUNDED BY
ALL THE ALUM.

39:28.017 --> 39:29.410
THINKING ANY ONE OF
THEM COULD'VE BEEN

39:29.454 --> 39:31.760
MY BIO MOM OR DAD.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.066
I KEPT, LIKE,
LOOKING IN THEIR FACES

39:33.109 --> 39:36.417
TO SEE IF I
RECOGNIZED A NOSE OR

39:36.461 --> 39:38.332
A SET OF EYES
OR SOMETHING.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.507
DID YOU SEE ANYONE
THAT MAYBE

39:39.551 --> 39:41.117
SPARKED A MEMORY?

39:41.161 --> 39:42.554
NAH. HEH.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.297
BUT THIS WEEKEND...

39:47.341 --> 39:49.865
IT HELPED ME
MAKE A DECISION.

39:49.909 --> 39:50.997
I'M GONNA START
SEARCHING FOR MY REAL

39:51.040 --> 39:52.085
BIRTH PARENTS.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.654
I--I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS SOMETHING

39:55.697 --> 39:57.395
YOU WERE EVEN CONSIDERING.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.788
I THOUGHT YOU
DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.094
YEAH, I, UM...

40:03.009 --> 40:04.532
I TOLD MYSELF
THAT I DIDN'T.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.580
I TRIED TO IGNORE IT
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

40:08.623 --> 40:09.711
IT WOULD HURT MY MOM.

40:10.973 --> 40:12.975
BUT I CAN'T DENY
HOW I FEEL ANYMORE.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.978
