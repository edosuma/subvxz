01:22.283 --> 01:23.684
Need a ride, darlin'?

01:33.561 --> 01:35.763
Someone needs to teach crazy
here some manners.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.681

Where you goin'?!

01:44.705 --> 01:46.507
He's gon' get ya!

02:01.855 --> 02:04.192
Watch out, now!

02:04.225 --> 02:05.393
Ooh! Watch out, girl!

02:05.426 --> 02:06.860
We got a live one! Ha!

02:06.894 --> 02:09.197
Get her in the truck!
Get in that truck, girl.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.798
Get her arms, Boone!

02:10.830 --> 02:13.401
Hold her down, man!
Get those arms!

02:13.434 --> 02:14.502
I'm tryin'!

02:14.535 --> 02:15.836
She just keeps movin'!

02:15.869 --> 02:17.438
Don't let her buck, Boone!

02:17.471 --> 02:18.939
Hold her down! I got... I got...

02:18.972 --> 02:21.309
Firecracker, damn it! Stupid...

02:22.376 --> 02:23.376
Hey!

02:24.378 --> 02:25.646
Son of a bitch.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.751
Best think this through, boy.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.486
You don't know
who you're messin' with.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.390
Aah!

02:57.645 --> 02:59.680
Let's get out of here, Boone!

02:59.713 --> 03:00.948
Get up, Boone!

03:00.981 --> 03:02.283
Let's go! Get out of here!

03:04.017 --> 03:05.986
You're dead, boy!

03:27.841 --> 03:29.743
Hey.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.483
All right. Stay here.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.885
I'ma go get somebody
that can help, okay?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.720
I'll be right back, okay?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.965
Can you tell me what happened?

05:34.668 --> 05:37.538
Did he...

05:37.571 --> 05:39.507
put his hands on you?

05:45.513 --> 05:47.347
You can tell me.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.518
You're safe.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.588
I won't let him hurt you again.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.871
My father used to...

06:10.904 --> 06:14.575
hurt my mother that way.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.813
And when I tried to stop him...

06:19.847 --> 06:22.049
the fists'd come out.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.487
So...

06:43.604 --> 06:45.973
I seen you before.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.475
Where?

06:47.508 --> 06:50.544
I play music sometimes
down at Blind Tillie's.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.179
The black club?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.147
Yes, ma'am.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.221
I look like
the kind of white woman

07:01.254 --> 07:02.990
who hangs out at a black club?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.963
Just where'd you get
the idea that we tolerate

07:09.997 --> 07:14.034
black boys messin'
with white girls in this town?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.169
I didn't touch her, I swear.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.138
It was two white boys
in a black pickup.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.960
You wearin' a belt, Bobby Joe?

07:41.529 --> 07:42.730
What you mean?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.233
You wearin' a belt, I said.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.969
Well, yes, ma'am.

07:50.671 --> 07:55.042
A belt's a good way to put
an end to all this.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.209
That's what I'm sayin'.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.813
I want to talk to my lawyer.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.551
What'd you say?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.953
I got a right, don't I?

08:07.087 --> 08:08.922
That's funny.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.859
He's right.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.300
Whatever rights he had,

08:20.333 --> 08:21.735
after what he done to that girl,

08:21.769 --> 08:22.970
he don't have any more.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.906
She ain't said
what he did to her.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.642
We know what he did.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.612
He asked for his lawyer.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.902
Never mind. Cut him loose.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.095
Well, I didn't say we should cut him lose.
Nope. I did.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.607
Get him outta here.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.580
It's your lucky day, boy.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.664
What do you...
What do you think?

09:56.697 --> 09:59.166
You think we lost 'em?

09:59.199 --> 10:02.002
I think we the ones lost.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.104
'Cause II think we lost 'em.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.906
Keep walkin'.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.745
What the hell is this?

10:22.723 --> 10:27.227
Even when we're lost,
all roads lead to him.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.962
Who? The Klan.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.430
Brown's the head of it.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.201
Aw, sorry I got you
into this mess, Leonard.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.036
The hell you sorry for?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.071
Ain't your fault
people are assholes.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.273
I'm still sorry.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.976
Don't you go
get soft on me, now, Hap.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.278
We got our hands on Brown,
I'ma need ya.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.817
All right.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.929
Well.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.833
Damn.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.916
Aw, hell!

11:22.950 --> 11:24.451
Aw! The hell with that!

11:28.989 --> 11:30.758
God damn!

11:33.093 --> 11:35.863
Aah! Aah!

11:47.274 --> 11:49.242
Now I'm gon' blame you
for all this.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.811
Blame me? What'd I do?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.947
Well, you hadn't burned down
that crack house,

11:53.981 --> 11:56.249
Hanson wouldn't have
gotten the idea

11:56.283 --> 11:57.484
to send us all down here.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.386
Hanson didn't send us...
He sent you.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.454
Only reason I'm here
is 'cause I'm stupid enough

12:01.488 --> 12:02.856
to be your goddamn friend.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.858
If Florida woulda amscrayed

12:04.892 --> 12:07.895
when she realized Grovetown
wasn't no Disney World,

12:07.928 --> 12:09.196
we wouldn't be here now.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.831
Aah!

12:15.302 --> 12:16.837
Aah!

12:18.371 --> 12:21.308
Damn!

12:21.341 --> 12:22.843
What the hell was that?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.144
I don't know.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.125
Florida's car.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.962
Gee.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.168
Hey, hey! Hey.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.403
Just 'cause we found her car,

12:50.437 --> 12:52.205
that don't mean to say
she's dead.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.809
Don't mean she ain't either.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.254
Ooh. Just in time.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.858
Hap.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.978
Hey. Gimme that.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.050
Let me go! Stop it!

13:37.084 --> 13:38.218
Let go!

13:54.667 --> 13:57.470
She dead, ain't she?

14:03.210 --> 14:04.945
Probably.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.857
What else is on there?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.533
Reminder...

14:26.566 --> 14:28.969
Call Gary Randall
at Slaughter/Connolly.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.138
I want to find out
if licensing L.C.'s song

14:31.171 --> 14:33.073
might be an option
if I don't like

14:33.106 --> 14:35.475
the split this guy
offers on distribution.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.377
Also, how long

14:37.410 --> 14:39.650
until the rights for the master
revert back to Bobby Joe?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.217
Note to self... if I ever have
a chance to get a record deal,

14:44.251 --> 14:45.552
find a lawyer who knows

14:45.585 --> 14:47.320
more about the music business
than I do.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.662
So if you're too shopped out
to cook, too tired,

14:55.695 --> 14:57.664
if that soninlaw you can't stand

14:57.697 --> 15:01.201
eats all the green pickles
before you say grace,

15:01.234 --> 15:05.238
if your family's too damn big
or just too damn lazy,

15:05.272 --> 15:08.208
get on down to Maude's Diner.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.477
It's the place to be
this Christmas.

15:10.510 --> 15:14.214
Now, as promised, Mr. Burl Ives.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.554
All right.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.363
Hi. How you doing?

15:30.397 --> 15:32.065
Sonny Knox. Florida Grange.

15:32.099 --> 15:37.004
So, where's that boy?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.505
II'm sorry.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.240
Bobby Joe
should've been here by now.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.976
Well... you know how it is,

15:43.010 --> 15:45.712
between CP time
and musician time...

15:45.745 --> 15:47.247
No offense.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.249
Some taken.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.750
Can I get you anything...

15:50.783 --> 15:54.754
Coffee, wine,
champagne spritzer?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.090
Coffee'd be nice, thank you.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.725
Coffee. How do you like it?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.060
A little sugar, please.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.395
Little sugar.
Thank you, thank you.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.270
Geez. She's beautiful.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.542
Stay cool, stay cool.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.310
Stay Sonny.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.247
Little sugar. Stay Sonny.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.115
All right, all right.
There we go.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.723
There you go.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.359
Thank you. Yeah.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.028
So funny... we like,
our coffee the same.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.098
You know, that's...
It's amazing 'cause, you know,

16:38.131 --> 16:41.234
Jews were like
the original black people.

16:41.268 --> 16:43.736
Well, yyou know,
they were more brown.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.139
That's why Jews and blacks
always got along

16:46.173 --> 16:49.442
because... you know,
it's like bagels and lox.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.711
We're like an endangered
species here, you know?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.380
I mean, bottom line,

16:53.413 --> 16:56.749
sometimes you got
to see kismet for what it is.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.519
And what is that?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.054
Kismet.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.792
Mr. Knox I'm short on time.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.361
Sh... Shall we get down
to business?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.396
Yeah, sure. Have
you heard the recording?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.132
Not yet, no.

17:12.165 --> 17:15.301
Well, you know, it was
L.C. Soothe's last recording.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.704
Bobby Joe thinks
it's worth a fortune.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.540
I'm not so sure. But...

17:20.573 --> 17:24.577
But I'm feeling great,
it's Christmastime,

17:24.611 --> 17:26.813
and I'm willin'
to make Bobby Joe a deal.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.616
I didn't know,
Jews celebrated Christmas.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.552
Yeah, well, you know,
when in Grovetown...

17:32.585 --> 17:34.354
So, you know what?

17:34.387 --> 17:35.855
This is nuts.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.758
$1,000, all... I'm not even
gonna think about...

17:38.791 --> 17:41.694
All in... publishing, masters.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.864
I'll even throw in a new guitar.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.266
Well... Well, nearly new.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.235
My... My friend left it here
a month ago.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.571
Either, um, what they say
about disc jockeys is true

17:51.604 --> 17:54.374
or you think you're talkin'
to a fool.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.777
What do they say
about disc jockeys? What...

17:57.810 --> 18:00.347
That the only thing they know
how to lay down is a record.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.526
You want to throw down with me,
you gon' have to come correct.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.152
All right. Okay.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.354
Listen, why don't we get
out of here, have a drink?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.398
Things always feel better
with a drink in your hand.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.893
I think your record is skippin'.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.497
Just hold on.
Just let me... Damn.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.236
Burl Ives, I hate you.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.808
Listen, listen, I got a plan.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.210
We go for a drink,

18:30.243 --> 18:32.479
we get somethin' to eat,
me and you.

18:32.512 --> 18:36.449
Kismet, remember? Kismet?

18:36.483 --> 18:37.784
The last man

18:37.817 --> 18:40.853
who put his hands on me
without an invitation...

18:40.887 --> 18:42.422
I shot.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.723
Shot.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.192
You call me when you get serious

18:45.225 --> 18:46.659
about makin' a deal
with Bobby Joe.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.897
She shot a man!

18:52.232 --> 18:53.200
She shot a man.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.467
"Last man that..."

18:54.501 --> 18:56.736
She's got a lot of fire
in her gut.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.438
She really does.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.175
Forget about Burl.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.743
Let me tell you about this girl.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.178
Ahey! You get it?

19:05.212 --> 19:06.713
Like a rhyme.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.359
LaBorde Sheriff's Department.
Officer Pendergrasp.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.760
How may I direct your call?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.362
Detective Marvin Hanson, please.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.596
This is Florida Grange.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.765
Hey, merry Christmas, Florida.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.500
Merry Christmas, Peg.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.836
If you don't mind
me saying this...

20:03.870 --> 20:08.241
I know he's been calling you,
but you're a strong black woman.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.376
Can I say that?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.478
You just did.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.012
Well, it's none of my business,

20:13.045 --> 20:15.548
but sometimes the best thing

20:15.582 --> 20:17.817
you can give yourself
for Christmas

20:17.850 --> 20:20.953
is the one thing no one would
ever think to give you,

20:20.987 --> 20:22.989
and that is to move on.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.624
Thank you.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.493
Now, can you put
the call through, please?

20:26.526 --> 20:27.727
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.296
Yes, ma'am.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.799
Lieutenant Hanson.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.401
Merry Christmas, Marvin.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.044
You know what would make
for a very merry Christmas?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.938
Marvin, I think I need your help
with something. Could you...

20:38.971 --> 20:41.908
Hold on a minute, Florida.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.857
Sorry. Go ahead.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.559
Look, I'm in Grovetown.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.294
Grovetown? Why?

21:01.328 --> 21:03.663
I came here to negotiate
a contract for a client.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.366
We had a meeting scheduled.
He never showed.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.301
I can't think
of any reason unless...

21:08.335 --> 21:09.702
Unless what?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.571
Unless something happened.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.072
Something like what, Florida?

21:13.105 --> 21:15.742
I don't know.
Use your imagination.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.077
I'd like for you to call
the Grovetown Police Department,

21:18.110 --> 21:20.913
put out an APB
for Bobby Joe Soothe.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.682
I got a better idea...
You come home.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.851
I don't like you being
down there alone.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.486
So you're not gon' help me.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.656
I'm helping you by telling you
to get out of Grovetown.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.461
Fine.
I'll take care of it myself.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.062
Baby, please come home.

21:36.095 --> 21:39.332
I can't.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.468
Not yet.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.970
And you don't get
to call me "baby" anymore.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.459
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.461
I would die for one. Thank you.

22:13.433 --> 22:17.504
Good Lord.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.006
That and a little...
Something a little heavier?

22:20.039 --> 22:21.608
Thank you.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.979
Hey, Frank. Hey, Truman.
Merry Christmas.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.515
How you doin', Margaret?

22:28.548 --> 22:29.782
Hi, Truman.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.586
Coffee, Maude.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.690
Black and hot.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.732
Today.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.608
You're sittin' at my table.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.512
There's plenty of room
at the counter.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.052
Well, it's just
that I like sittin' here.

23:07.687 --> 23:10.757
Hey, everybody! There's aa dude
hangin' from the bridge!

23:39.051 --> 23:40.491
Unit 12,
you got everything you need?

23:42.789 --> 23:47.594
Little out of your jurisdiction,
aren't you, Ms. Grange?

23:49.496 --> 23:51.564
I wondered
what happened to you, Sneed.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.232
I bet you fit in
real good around here.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.967
Is that your chief?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.536
This area's closed.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.037
That's Bobby Joe Soothe.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.138
And what's that make you?

23:59.171 --> 24:00.507
His lawyer.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.513
Good. Here we go.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.590
Chief.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.892
This is Florida Grange
from LaBorde.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.861
Says she's the dead guy's
lawyer.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.763
What happened here?

24:23.796 --> 24:26.766
Fella died at the end of a rope,
and someone called it in.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.200
Now you know what I know.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.136
There's an FBI unit
in Nacogdoches.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.137
You call them?

24:31.170 --> 24:33.640
No. No, I haven't.

24:33.673 --> 24:37.076
But I will call you
should I need your services.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.278
Do you do estate plannin'?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.680
Here we go.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.849
Somebody hung
a black man from a bridge,

24:42.882 --> 24:45.652
and that makes this
a federal case.

24:46.919 --> 24:50.156
Maybe it's just a good,
oldfashioned suicide.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.258
People tend to off themselves
around the holidays.

24:52.291 --> 24:56.763
I can't say why...
Depression, loneliness, boredom.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.965
Maybe...

24:58.998 --> 25:01.109
Maybe he just didn't get
what he wanted for Christmas.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.769
You think this is funny?

25:02.802 --> 25:06.305
I think it would be funny
if we made any decisions

25:06.338 --> 25:09.141
before the coroner has his say.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.243
Fine.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.614
I'd like to be present
at the autopsy.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.083
This ain't the way
I do things in my town.

25:17.116 --> 25:23.122
But I will need you to come
on down to identify the body.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.705
So, what do you say, Frank?

25:38.738 --> 25:41.007
Died of cerebral
hypoxia, Chief...

25:41.040 --> 25:42.609
Asphyxiation due to...

25:42.642 --> 25:45.712
So it is possible
that he hung himself?

25:45.745 --> 25:47.046
It's possible.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.815
Seriously?

25:50.149 --> 25:51.851
Always best we keep an open mind

25:51.884 --> 25:54.621
about these things, Ms. Grange,
until we know more.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.757
That's kind of hard to do when
you're clearly leading him.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.127
What Bobby Joe do, beat himself
up and then hang himself?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.230
How many dead bodies you seen?

26:04.263 --> 26:06.999
Enough to know that this man
did not kill himself.

26:07.033 --> 26:12.672
Exactly how do you know
that... doctor?

26:12.705 --> 26:15.775
He's got bruises on his face,
a cut on his lip,

26:15.808 --> 26:18.611
ligature marks on his wrists
that suggest he's been tied up.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.981
Now, I suppose it's possible
that he tied himself up,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.651
beat himself up,
and then hung himself.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.253
I mean, this is Grovetown,
right?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.293
I tell you what.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.896
Why don't we call it
a suicide, Frank,

26:36.929 --> 26:38.965
but you put that in pencil.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.200
If my investigation
turns up anything,

26:41.233 --> 26:44.103
well, we could always change it.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.106
Can I use your phone, Frank?

26:50.009 --> 26:51.778
Pay phone's down the hall.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.857
What are you doing?

27:06.292 --> 27:09.996
Calling the FBI in Nacogdoches.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.398
Now, now, Ms. Grange.

27:12.431 --> 27:17.336
It's a little premature,
don't you think?

27:17.369 --> 27:20.039
Why is it the men in this town
always try to calm me down

27:20.072 --> 27:21.708
when I know that they're lyin'?

27:21.741 --> 27:23.743
Go home, counselor.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.945
Your client's dead.
My nuts are barkin'.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.014
Nothin' you're doin' right now

27:28.047 --> 27:31.217
is gonna bring him back
or me any relief.

27:31.250 --> 27:35.254
I find something out,
I'll call ya.

27:46.866 --> 27:51.437
I find something out,
I'll call ya.

27:54.140 --> 27:58.277
He definitely part of it,
however it went down.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.268
That was a trunk.

28:30.509 --> 28:31.509
Better let me look

28:33.012 --> 28:34.122
case you don't like
what ya find in there.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.382
Good idea.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.097
Hap.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.165
Thank God!

28:53.199 --> 28:54.801
Don't go gettin'
all religious on me.

28:54.834 --> 28:59.338
She ain't here, so...
so there's hope.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.909
How do you see hope?

29:02.942 --> 29:04.210
Look around, Hap.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.812
We're stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

29:05.845 --> 29:07.346
wet and cold as shit!

29:07.379 --> 29:10.549
Bobby Joe Soothe is dead,
Florida missin',

29:10.582 --> 29:13.552
and the Klan is on our ass!

29:13.585 --> 29:16.022
We don't know how we're gon'
get through the night,

29:16.055 --> 29:17.456
much less get out of Grovetown.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.025
No matter what happens,

29:19.058 --> 29:21.227
you always see everything
as peachy keen!

29:26.265 --> 29:29.035
Come on! Get in!

29:36.608 --> 29:40.146
Hold that.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.849
Just 'cause Florida
ain't in this trunk

29:42.882 --> 29:44.984
don't mean she ain't
in some other trunk.

29:45.017 --> 29:49.221
Till I know for sure she's dead,
she ain't dead.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.390
All right?

29:51.423 --> 29:53.325
We agree on that?

29:53.359 --> 29:56.963
You know, sometimes
I worry about you.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.131
Yeah, well, I appreciate that.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.168
Right now,
we got to get to Hanson

30:02.201 --> 30:03.469
'fore Hanson gets to Cantuck

30:03.502 --> 30:05.404
'cause if Cantuck
is who we think he is...

30:07.439 --> 30:08.841
Hanson might be next.

30:08.875 --> 30:09.909
Now...

30:09.942 --> 30:11.610
Yep.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.322
No, no, no. God damn it!

30:23.355 --> 30:24.556
What?

30:24.590 --> 30:25.892
Out of gas.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.394
You got to be shittin' me!

30:28.427 --> 30:31.463
No, I ain't shittin' you.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.449
Hello?

30:52.584 --> 30:54.853
Excuse me? Is anybody here?

30:56.322 --> 30:58.057
Well, hello.

30:58.090 --> 31:01.060
Good afternoon.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.995
Please tell me you ain't lost.

31:03.029 --> 31:06.198
I'm Bobby Joe Soothe's lawyer.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.467
I'd like to see his room,
please.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.337
Well, I'd have
to ask the owner first.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.472
Wait a minute. I am the owner.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.544
That was...

31:18.577 --> 31:21.613
I'm sorry. That...
You're just so pretty.

31:21.647 --> 31:25.117
Um, Tim Garner.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.552
Florida Grange. Hi.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.220
Can I see Bobby Joe's room?

31:28.254 --> 31:31.323
Um, I'd like to show you.
I really would.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.092
But, see, Chief told me he...

31:33.125 --> 31:35.161
Bobby Joe, that is...
Committed suicide.

31:35.194 --> 31:36.528
Poor man.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.430
We all got our devils, I guess.-

31:38.464 --> 31:41.333
Anyway, Chief told me not
to let anyone in after he left.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.402
He don't want nobody
messin' with his stuff

31:43.435 --> 31:45.637
till he says so, is what, um...

31:47.273 --> 31:49.175
Will that get me in?

31:53.312 --> 31:57.016
Well, Bobby Joe does
still owe 72 bucks for the room,

31:57.049 --> 31:59.318
and dead men ain't known
to pay their bills so...

32:01.187 --> 32:03.990
II'll need a room
for the night, as well,

32:04.023 --> 32:05.291
and some gas.

32:05.324 --> 32:09.361
Yeah,
ththat'll be $12 for the room.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.230
Gas, you'll have to wait on.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.099
I'm expecting
a delivery tomorrow.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.637
There you are.
You keep the change.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.307
Okay.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.293
Chief of Police says
this is his town.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.028
This is his town,

33:16.062 --> 33:18.397
he knows who killed Bobby Joe.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.232
For all I know, he's in on it.

33:20.266 --> 33:23.635
I need to find someone
around here who I can trust,

33:23.669 --> 33:26.338
somebody who knows
what's goin' on.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.275
Maybe, the cook at the diner.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.818
You hang around here
as long as he has,

33:30.842 --> 33:32.111
you're bound to know something.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.431
I was hopin' I'd find you here.

33:52.464 --> 33:55.067
Good mornin'.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.302
Yesterday was a good mornin'.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.672
Today... not so much.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.242
Thank you.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.111
Thank you, sir.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.551
Howdy.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.237
Would you like to have this?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.587
You know, I tried to be nice.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.322
Bacon, didn't I try to be nice?

34:51.357 --> 34:53.792
But here you are again
in my seat.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.161
I thought that was your seat.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.629
They're all my seats.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.531
I thought I made
that clear yesterday.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.170
What's clear to me, sir,
is that federal law prohibits

35:04.203 --> 35:08.274
any establishment, even in
a town as backwards as this one,

35:08.307 --> 35:11.610
from discriminatin'
on the basis of race, color,

35:11.643 --> 35:14.313
religion, or national origin.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.282
Most people know that that means

35:16.315 --> 35:17.716
that even if you're black,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.585
if this is America,

35:19.618 --> 35:24.623
you can eat at a restaurant...
Any restaurant.

35:24.656 --> 35:27.459
Now you know that, too.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.830
Boy.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.365
You better tame your girl here.

35:33.399 --> 35:34.900
She's got a mouth on her.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.269
She ain't my girl...

35:37.303 --> 35:40.406
any more than I'm your boy.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.712
What?

35:48.514 --> 35:51.283
Old man, you're lucky
I like your Huevos Rancheros.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.484
Ooh! Hey.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.588
Bacon.

35:56.622 --> 35:59.591
Let's get Ms. Grange
her coffee to go, please.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.726
Comin' up.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.594
I'd say that's a good idea.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.350
Weather's unpredictable.
It's got teeth.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.852
If I was you,
I'd drive straight through.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.920
You don't want
to be dillydallying

36:28.954 --> 36:30.322
around here no more.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.826
I know you took those tapes
from Bobby Joe's trailer.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.374
Don't come back.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.792
And the river run rough sometime.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.061
River run wild,
and it run serene.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.085
Ho, ho, h...

38:11.490 --> 38:12.924
Ho!

38:15.861 --> 38:18.330
What if you're wrong?

38:20.566 --> 38:22.368
If the Klan killed Bobby Joe,

38:22.401 --> 38:24.011
the L.C. Soothe tapes
would've been in his trailer.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.671
They weren't.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.615
Those tapes would have
to be worth a lot of money

38:27.639 --> 38:28.607
to kill somebody over.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.409
Well, they're worth enough.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.411
I think whoever killed Bobby Joe

38:32.444 --> 38:34.913
wanted to make it look
like the Klan did it.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.416
Whoever tries to sell
those tapes to Sonny Knox

38:37.449 --> 38:38.917
is the killer.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.553
Daggone.
You're real good at this.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.489
Unfortunately,
I've had a lot of practice.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.645
Sonny?

39:13.952 --> 39:16.722
Sonny, are you around?

39:16.755 --> 39:18.657
Sonny.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.962
God. Jesus, Sonny!

39:23.995 --> 39:25.831
Aah. Aah! Aah.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.032
Who did this to ya?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.834
I gotta get the shit
kicked out of me

39:28.867 --> 39:30.769
to get some attention from you?

39:32.604 --> 39:33.905
Who did this, Sonny?

39:33.939 --> 39:36.975
Cleavon. Aah.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.478
The bass player
from Blind Tillie's.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.680
Was lookin'
for Bobby Joe's tapes.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.981
Lookin' or sellin'?

39:43.014 --> 39:43.982
Lookin'.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.518
Aah!

39:46.552 --> 39:48.787
Where you goin'?!

39:52.090 --> 39:53.925
Now, I didn't kill no Bobby Joe.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.461
He owe me money.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.729
You don't kill
a man that owe you money.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.699
You beat up Sonny Knox,
so you'll forgive me

40:00.732 --> 40:02.834
if I have a hard time
believin' you right now.

40:02.868 --> 40:07.138
I punched him 'cause I thought
he got them tapes.

40:07.172 --> 40:10.676
And I figured it'd make up
for what Bobby Joe owed me.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.845
Baby, I could use
a drink right now.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.081
In fact, I think we all could.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.816
II'm all... I'm fine, thank you.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.919
She'll have one. Just bring it.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.588
All right. Just one.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.089
Of course just one.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.757
I ain't made of free booze.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.794
Go on, Cleavon. Go on.

40:31.897 --> 40:34.199
He's a good man.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.835
Bass player.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.537
All a bass player wanna do

40:38.570 --> 40:42.173
is put a song in your heart
and a swing in your step.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.211
'Course,
he's a expert at foreplay.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.247
But, now, a percussionist?

40:49.280 --> 40:51.550
Child, mnhmnh.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.951
They dangerous.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.820
Crazy.

40:54.853 --> 40:58.189
Psycho amazing sex, though.

40:58.223 --> 41:01.259
But they ain't good
at longterm relationships.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.863
They got too much anger
built up in 'em.

41:04.896 --> 41:08.133
But it wasn't no
percussionist killed Bobby Joe.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.735
Who do you think killed him?

41:09.768 --> 41:12.003
It wasn't no percussionist.

41:12.037 --> 41:16.642
Women loved Bobby Joe.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.777
And he loved to love the women.

41:19.911 --> 41:24.716
Women and cards.
That's what he loved.

41:24.750 --> 41:28.820
But he wasn't lucky
in love or lucky in cards.

41:28.854 --> 41:33.992
But havin' bad luck alone
don't get ya killed over here.

41:34.025 --> 41:37.629
No. Mnhmnh.

41:37.663 --> 41:40.866
We all know
what killed Bobby Joe.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.672
I wish you were wrong.

41:48.674 --> 41:51.209
Me too, girl. Me too.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.265
Shit.

42:19.738 --> 42:21.873
So, find out how long

42:21.907 --> 42:24.776
till the rights to the master
revert back to Bobby Joe.

42:24.810 --> 42:29.114
And, note to self...

42:29.147 --> 42:31.683
If I ever have a chance
to sign a record deal,

42:31.717 --> 42:33.151
find a lawyer who knows

42:33.184 --> 42:34.744
more about the music business
than I do.

42:36.855 --> 42:38.624
To Bobby Joe.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.728
Joe.
