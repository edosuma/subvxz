THERE'S A
BETTER WAY!

22:09.161 --> 22:10.495
GREAT! I'LL
DO ANYTHING!

22:10.579 --> 22:12.581
THIS GUY'S CRAZY!

22:12.664 --> 22:17.252
{\an1}NO. SEE,
IT'S KA-RAZY.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.336
[WILDCAT ROAR]

22:21.298 --> 22:22.007
WE'VE HEARD
ALL THE FACTS,

22:22.090 --> 22:25.177
AND WE'VE MADE
A DECISION.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.512
{\an4}BILLY, YOU WILL AGREE
TO STOP BULLYING
COCONUT HEAD

22:27.596 --> 22:30.974
{\an1}AND TO LEAVE HIS CLOTHES
TURNED THE RIGHT WAY.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.269
{\an1}NED AND COOKIE, YOU WILL AGREE
TO STOP BOTHERING LOOMER.

22:34.352 --> 22:35.604
WHAT?!

22:34.352 --> 22:35.604
WHAT?!

22:35.687 --> 22:36.938
US?

22:37.022 --> 22:39.149
STOP BOTHERING HIM?!

22:39.232 --> 22:41.443
Moze: YOU ACTED CRAZY
TO TRY TO SCARE HIM,

22:41.526 --> 22:43.445
AND YOU TRIED TO WIPE HIM OUT
WITH THE MOP-BUCKET SLINGSHOT.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.865
{\an1}Claire: AND YOU MUST AGREE TO
NEVER WEAR YOUR UNDERWEAR

22:46.948 --> 22:48.950
OUTSIDE YOUR CLOTHES, EVER.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.662
WE WANTED TO SEND LOOMER TO
AN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOL!

22:52.746 --> 22:53.955
WE WERE DOING HIM A FAVOR!

22:54.039 --> 22:55.582
SHRIMP COCKTAIL!

23:10.097 --> 23:12.724
PEER MEDIATION DID NOT WORK OUT
PERFECTLY FOR ME,

23:12.808 --> 23:13.809
BUT IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM,

23:13.892 --> 23:15.602
{\an7}AND IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY
HAVE IT AT YOUR SCHOOL,

23:15.685 --> 23:18.814
{\an7}YOU SHOULD TRY GETTING IT OR
THINK ABOUT STARTING YOUR OWN.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.941
{\an8}IT CAN BE A REAL BULLY SAVER.

23:21.024 --> 23:25.320
{\an1}Narrator: AH, JUST AS IN NATURE,
PEER MEDIATION HAS SOLVED

23:25.403 --> 23:27.823
THE CONFLICT
BETWEEN PREDATOR AND PREY.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.450
WAIT ONE MOMENT!

23:30.534 --> 23:33.161
THERE IS NO PEER MEDIATION
IN NATURE.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.122
IN NATURE,
THE CUTE FURRY LITTLE ANIMALS

23:35.205 --> 23:37.165
ALL EAT EACH OTHER.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.625
GORDY, ENOUGH WITH
THE NARRATION, ALREADY!

23:40.961 --> 23:47.259
AND SO, WE BID ADIEU
TO THE WILD UNTAMED LANDS OF--

23:47.342 --> 23:47.509
Ned, Moze, and Cookie:
GORDY!

23:53.932 --> 23:55.767
AW, OING-OING.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.435
{\an1}OING-OING.

23:57.519 --> 23:58.270
Lincoln:
GIVE ME MY HAT.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.771
{\an1}Arnold:
LAH-LAH-LAH-LAH LAA!

23:59.855 --> 24:02.440
[LAUGHS]

24:02.524 --> 24:05.902
{\an1}Cookie: AAH--
AAH--AAH--AAH--AAH!

24:05.986 --> 24:08.572
{\an1}CUV IT!
