THE SKIN I LIVE IN

02:39.560 --> 02:41.846
Help me with the dumb waiter.

02:45.727 --> 02:47.385
Open it.

02:48.518 --> 02:49.762
Take this.

03:14.685 --> 03:16.427
Marilia, are you there?

03:20.310 --> 03:21.423
Yes.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.469
Send up more cloth
and double-sided tape.

03:25.310 --> 03:27.763
I can't get it until tomorrow.

03:28.393 --> 03:29.969
OK.

03:31.685 --> 03:36.426
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

03:36.602 --> 03:38.888
You're joking, right?

03:39.810 --> 03:41.516
Yeah.

04:19.685 --> 04:22.007
Our face identifies us.

04:22.142 --> 04:25.509
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

04:25.602 --> 04:31.101
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

04:31.477 --> 04:32.471
A face with features...

04:32.560 --> 04:35.309
so they can gesticulate.

04:35.352 --> 04:36.928
I have participated in

04:37.102 --> 04:39.507
three out of the nine
face transplants

04:39.602 --> 04:43.133
carried out in the world...

04:43.227 --> 04:46.674
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

04:49.102 --> 04:50.132
Good...

04:50.227 --> 04:52.797
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

04:52.852 --> 04:56.513
we have to mould the muscles...

04:56.602 --> 05:02.716
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

05:02.852 --> 05:04.558
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

08:49.727 --> 08:53.388
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

09:03.893 --> 09:05.386
OPERATING THEATER

09:27.102 --> 09:29.471
Can you breathe more gently?

09:30.143 --> 09:32.548
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.302
Don't talk rubbish.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.596
How long will all this last?

09:39.810 --> 09:42.477
Your skin is softer than I thought.

09:42.602 --> 09:44.971
If you don't end it, I will.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.346
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

09:47.435 --> 09:49.591
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

09:50.143 --> 09:51.766
In any case...

09:53.477 --> 09:56.179
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.136
Here it is...

10:06.685 --> 10:08.971
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

10:10.102 --> 10:11.642
Thank you.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.392
Now there won't be any more burns.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.596
You said that a year ago.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.390
I was hasty.

13:39.477 --> 13:41.514
Tell me if it burns you.

13:41.893 --> 13:43.351
No.

13:45.727 --> 13:47.552
And now?

13:47.977 --> 13:49.802
No.

13:51.810 --> 13:53.516
Now!

13:53.643 --> 13:55.184
I have given the name "Gal"...

13:55.310 --> 13:57.596
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

13:57.685 --> 13:58.715
in recent years.

13:58.810 --> 14:01.512
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

14:01.643 --> 14:04.890
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

14:04.977 --> 14:06.304
No.

14:06.477 --> 14:08.514
...which means a natural barrier to

14:08.643 --> 14:11.973
...malaria, for example.

14:12.268 --> 14:16.132
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

14:16.477 --> 14:19.095
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

14:19.185 --> 14:20.180
specifically, in athymic mice...

14:20.310 --> 14:22.265
and the results...

14:22.393 --> 14:27.134
...have been spectacular.

14:27.227 --> 14:29.052
This leads me to suppose

14:29.102 --> 14:31.139
they would be equally positive...

14:31.227 --> 14:33.016
in human mammals.

14:34.893 --> 14:38.590
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

14:38.727 --> 14:40.303
That was my wife's name.

14:40.435 --> 14:42.639
She was burned to death in a car crash.

14:42.810 --> 14:45.559
In you presentation you stated...

14:46.143 --> 14:50.635
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

14:50.768 --> 14:52.474
What makes you think that?

14:52.852 --> 14:56.098
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

14:56.227 --> 14:57.849
and it smells different.

14:57.977 --> 14:59.599
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

14:59.685 --> 15:02.256
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.923
Gal smells different and repels it.

15:05.060 --> 15:07.015
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

15:07.185 --> 15:08.726
That isn't enough.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.929
How did you toughen the skin?

15:13.435 --> 15:15.011
Excuse me.

15:17.268 --> 15:19.306
Let's go somewhere quieter.

15:19.393 --> 15:21.846
There's only one way to toughen skin.

15:21.935 --> 15:23.724
By mutating it.

15:24.435 --> 15:26.011
Yes, that's what I did.

15:26.102 --> 15:27.760
Transgenesis.

15:28.602 --> 15:32.263
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

15:33.018 --> 15:35.933
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.720
A pig's cell?

15:37.810 --> 15:39.599
It's much stronger than ours.

15:39.685 --> 15:41.178
You're insane!

15:41.602 --> 15:44.635
You know the application
of transgenetic therapy...

15:44.768 --> 15:46.309
in humans is completely forbidden!

15:46.435 --> 15:47.513
Yes, I do.

15:47.602 --> 15:51.298
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

15:51.935 --> 15:54.470
We intervene in everything around us...

15:54.602 --> 15:57.848
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

15:57.935 --> 16:01.715
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

16:01.768 --> 16:03.178
You know how many diseases...

16:03.268 --> 16:05.259
we could cure with transgenesis?

16:05.352 --> 16:07.721
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

16:07.768 --> 16:09.226
Don't go on!

16:09.310 --> 16:11.431
I know the list by heart...

16:11.768 --> 16:14.387
and I think of it every day.

16:15.477 --> 16:16.673
But even so...

16:16.768 --> 16:20.134
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

16:20.268 --> 16:22.259
or I'll be forced to report you...

16:22.310 --> 16:23.933
to the scientific community.

16:24.018 --> 16:25.973
Over and above what you or I may think...

16:26.060 --> 16:30.054
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

16:30.143 --> 16:35.429
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

16:35.727 --> 16:38.013
I did it in memory of my wife...

16:38.102 --> 16:40.804
and solely to extend my knowledge.

16:40.893 --> 16:41.841
I remember...

16:41.935 --> 16:44.849
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

16:44.977 --> 16:47.216
It seemed like a dream then.

16:47.643 --> 16:49.136
And it still is.

16:49.268 --> 16:52.634
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

16:52.977 --> 16:55.014
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

16:55.102 --> 16:58.965
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.808
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

17:03.935 --> 17:06.684
Your patients will be delighted.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.383
I don't know.

17:09.518 --> 17:12.551
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

17:12.685 --> 17:15.434
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

19:09.643 --> 19:12.048
Do you like what you see?

19:13.477 --> 19:15.597
What do you mean?

19:17.685 --> 19:20.304
Is there anything you want to improve?

19:21.602 --> 19:23.142
No.

19:23.477 --> 19:26.095
I don't want to improve anything.

19:27.310 --> 19:30.142
Can I take it I'm finished?

19:31.185 --> 19:32.843
Yes...

19:33.227 --> 19:36.557
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.884
And now what?

19:45.435 --> 19:48.102
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

19:48.185 --> 19:50.057
and smoke it.

19:50.477 --> 19:52.348
I mean us.

19:53.227 --> 19:54.803
Me.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.010
What are you going to do with me?

19:59.227 --> 20:01.300
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

20:01.393 --> 20:02.507
When?

20:02.602 --> 20:05.137
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

20:05.768 --> 20:08.766
Couldn't we just live?

20:10.352 --> 20:12.389
Live together.

20:12.727 --> 20:14.764
Live together?

20:15.227 --> 20:18.141
- How?
- Like everyone.

20:19.727 --> 20:22.393
You and I aren't like everyone.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.638
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.094
Living together as equals.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.017
That's it!

20:38.727 --> 20:40.184
Here.

20:40.852 --> 20:43.305
I could set fire
to the house with this.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.266
I'm yours.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.591
I'm made to measure for you.

20:55.227 --> 20:58.011
And you've just told me
that you like me.

20:58.435 --> 21:00.260
Did I say that?

21:02.727 --> 21:05.096
I know you look at me.

21:06.727 --> 21:08.468
Since you brought me here,

21:08.518 --> 21:11.267
we practically live in the same room.

21:17.518 --> 21:19.094
In this pocket.

21:55.393 --> 22:02.511
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.</i>

22:09.185 --> 22:11.720
You shouldn't have used her face.

22:12.060 --> 22:15.307
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

22:15.643 --> 22:17.930
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

22:18.018 --> 22:20.092
The resemblance is too strong.

22:20.685 --> 22:22.971
Have you thought
what to do with her?

22:23.102 --> 22:24.381
No.

22:24.518 --> 22:28.678
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

22:29.977 --> 22:32.761
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

22:33.060 --> 22:36.093
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

22:36.435 --> 22:38.591
Stories repeat themselves.

22:39.893 --> 22:41.599
No! Not this one!

22:42.143 --> 22:45.674
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

22:46.018 --> 22:48.009
You're sick.

22:48.310 --> 22:49.684
If you don't get rid of her...

22:49.768 --> 22:52.932
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

22:53.685 --> 22:56.387
When you realize, it'll be too late.

22:57.893 --> 23:01.555
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

23:02.977 --> 23:05.891
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

23:06.102 --> 23:08.768
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

23:45.477 --> 23:47.266
What do you want?

23:47.643 --> 23:51.340
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.</i>

23:51.560 --> 23:52.673
If she was a servant...

23:52.727 --> 23:55.096
they've just left and won't be back.

23:56.352 --> 23:59.054
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.</i>

23:59.227 --> 24:00.803
<i>My mother is prettier.</i>

24:00.893 --> 24:02.848
Go away or I'll call the police.

24:15.352 --> 24:17.177
Zeca!

24:19.685 --> 24:22.683
I'm your son, Zeca.

24:22.810 --> 24:24.552
How dare you come here!

24:24.685 --> 24:26.094
Open the door!

24:26.185 --> 24:31.933
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

24:32.352 --> 24:36.760
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

24:39.935 --> 24:41.641
Little tiger!

24:41.852 --> 24:44.138
I just want to see you for a minute.

24:44.310 --> 24:47.059
Very well, but then you leave.

24:47.477 --> 24:49.053
Whatever you say.

24:49.185 --> 24:53.759
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.225
How did you find us?

25:20.310 --> 25:24.434
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

25:24.602 --> 25:26.343
He was giving a...

25:28.185 --> 25:29.761
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

25:29.852 --> 25:31.759
I went there
and then followed him here.

25:31.810 --> 25:32.888
Can't I come in?

25:32.935 --> 25:36.265
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

25:36.768 --> 25:39.470
It smells good.
I'm hungry.

25:41.435 --> 25:42.892
Brute!

25:52.268 --> 25:54.223
<i>The main new items today...</i>

25:54.310 --> 25:57.059
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...</i>

25:57.185 --> 26:00.348
<i>and the daring robbery committed
in the Bvlgari jewellery store...</i>

26:00.393 --> 26:02.384
<i>in the heart of Madrid.</i>

26:02.518 --> 26:03.797
<i>It happened last night...</i>

26:03.935 --> 26:06.388
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...</i>

26:06.435 --> 26:12.633
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewellery store.</i>

26:13.893 --> 26:16.216
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...</i>

26:16.268 --> 26:19.799
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...</i>

26:19.893 --> 26:23.887
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.</i>

26:24.352 --> 26:27.266
As if they were going to find him!

26:28.227 --> 26:30.513
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

26:30.602 --> 26:32.924
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

26:33.060 --> 26:35.595
He'll be rotting in hell now.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.558
And the police are looking for you.

26:37.643 --> 26:41.554
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.925
You can hide me here for a few days.

26:44.018 --> 26:45.475
Hide you here?

26:45.518 --> 26:46.632
Not a chance.

26:46.893 --> 26:49.595
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

26:49.685 --> 26:51.675
I know how to hide.

26:51.810 --> 26:55.341
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

26:55.477 --> 26:57.183
Robert?

26:57.227 --> 26:59.300
When he gets you on the table...

26:59.352 --> 27:02.468
he'll give you a lethal injection!

27:02.768 --> 27:05.102
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

27:05.137 --> 27:06.559
after what you did?

27:06.602 --> 27:08.758
I'll have to blackmail him.

27:11.477 --> 27:14.759
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

27:15.685 --> 27:18.173
You're raving mad.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.013
I'm just a servant.

27:21.435 --> 27:24.184
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.094
Even better.

27:27.310 --> 27:29.763
I'll stay here till he comes back.

27:33.643 --> 27:35.017
Where are you going?

27:35.102 --> 27:37.555
- What do you want
- A drink.

27:40.185 --> 27:43.515
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

28:09.768 --> 28:10.965
What's this?

28:11.102 --> 28:12.642
It's a film!

28:13.018 --> 28:14.511
Go away!

28:38.102 --> 28:41.965
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

28:42.685 --> 28:44.261
Get out or I'll shoot.

28:45.518 --> 28:46.975
Mom...

28:47.643 --> 28:50.511
you wouldn't do that to your son.

28:51.310 --> 28:55.138
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

28:55.852 --> 28:58.305
- It's her.
- It's not her!

28:58.393 --> 28:59.934
How could it be her?

29:00.352 --> 29:02.010
Get out of here!

29:02.143 --> 29:03.553
Keep away!

29:10.935 --> 29:12.641
Marilia?

29:13.393 --> 29:15.882
I heard a noise, like a shot.

29:16.435 --> 29:17.928
Is anything wrong?

29:18.018 --> 29:19.973
<i>I heard voices too.</i>

29:21.060 --> 29:22.683
<i>Marilia?</i>

29:23.018 --> 29:24.511
Marilia!

29:47.227 --> 29:48.767
There.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.056
Who is it?

31:18.185 --> 31:20.140
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

31:20.685 --> 31:22.059
I can't.

31:22.185 --> 31:25.099
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

31:25.310 --> 31:26.933
Does Marilia have it?

31:27.185 --> 31:29.471
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

31:52.310 --> 31:54.715
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

32:02.935 --> 32:05.139
Where's the key to upstairs?

32:06.143 --> 32:08.264
In the drawer at the corner.

32:08.768 --> 32:10.593
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

32:10.643 --> 32:12.349
No, where is it?

32:13.102 --> 32:16.763
In that drawer, in an envelope.

32:23.227 --> 32:25.513
- It's not here!
- At the back!

32:31.060 --> 32:32.885
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

32:33.018 --> 32:36.964
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

32:43.018 --> 32:46.964
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

32:47.060 --> 32:49.548
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

32:49.685 --> 32:51.012
Open your mouth!

32:52.685 --> 32:56.631
Open it wider, mom!

32:57.810 --> 33:00.345
It all fit before.

33:46.935 --> 33:48.641
Did Robert send you?

33:49.643 --> 33:50.922
No.

33:51.102 --> 33:54.597
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.392
He saved me.

34:02.935 --> 34:05.009
Get me out of here!

34:05.102 --> 34:07.139
I'll go anywhere with you!

34:08.643 --> 34:10.433
You're saying that...

34:10.518 --> 34:12.260
because I'm on top of you.

34:13.143 --> 34:14.469
No!

34:15.101 --> 34:18.716
Ask me for anything!

34:18.768 --> 34:21.766
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

34:21.893 --> 34:24.464
I don't know. Lots of things!

34:24.893 --> 34:26.516
I'll do whatever you want.

34:28.810 --> 34:30.847
You could help me with Robert.

34:30.976 --> 34:32.766
How do you get on with him now?

34:33.685 --> 34:35.225
Great.

34:36.060 --> 34:38.429
- Great?
- Yes.

34:38.893 --> 34:42.259
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

34:42.351 --> 34:43.809
Yes.

34:45.643 --> 34:47.882
I'll take you with me.

34:48.018 --> 34:49.973
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

34:51.060 --> 34:55.433
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

34:57.018 --> 34:59.685
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

35:04.727 --> 35:05.970
Listen...

35:06.727 --> 35:07.674
What?

35:07.768 --> 35:10.055
Let’s fuck in the garden, please!

35:10.143 --> 35:14.054
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

35:14.352 --> 35:16.223
This tiger wants a bed.

35:22.935 --> 35:24.641
Don't you like it?

35:24.977 --> 35:26.434
You're hurting me.

35:27.143 --> 35:28.684
It's very big.

35:28.810 --> 35:31.559
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

35:32.102 --> 35:33.025
Yes...

35:33.060 --> 35:35.727
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

35:35.977 --> 35:40.550
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

36:54.185 --> 36:55.843
Kill her!

36:57.018 --> 36:58.511
Kill them both!

37:28.101 --> 37:31.348
As children,
they played at killing each other.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.925
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

37:38.018 --> 37:40.139
The tiger and Robert?

37:40.768 --> 37:42.178
Yes.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.469
They're brothers...

37:45.476 --> 37:47.597
but they don't know it.

37:48.351 --> 37:50.674
At least I've never told them.

37:52.726 --> 37:56.388
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

37:57.476 --> 38:02.264
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

38:02.643 --> 38:07.715
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

38:10.018 --> 38:12.222
It's my fault.

38:18.685 --> 38:21.967
I've got insanity in my entrails.

38:22.518 --> 38:25.185
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

38:25.310 --> 38:27.596
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

38:28.185 --> 38:32.759
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

38:34.643 --> 38:37.392
and said she'd given birth to him.

38:39.435 --> 38:43.096
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

38:45.226 --> 38:48.094
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

38:48.268 --> 38:52.428
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

38:54.476 --> 38:58.221
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

39:00.518 --> 39:04.180
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

39:04.310 --> 39:08.350
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

39:10.768 --> 39:17.973
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

39:19.060 --> 39:21.974
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

39:23.476 --> 39:25.716
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

39:26.560 --> 39:29.676
she took a fancy to him...

39:29.851 --> 39:32.305
and they ended up
running away together.

39:34.601 --> 39:37.055
Their car crashed,

39:37.726 --> 39:39.883
Zeca survived and ran away.

39:41.643 --> 39:43.550
But she...

39:46.518 --> 39:52.846
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

39:56.601 --> 40:00.298
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

40:02.601 --> 40:08.219
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

40:08.643 --> 40:10.219
He didn't sleep.

40:12.601 --> 40:16.926
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

40:17.060 --> 40:19.465
covered with gauzes.

40:20.435 --> 40:24.263
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

40:25.810 --> 40:28.642
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

40:30.476 --> 40:33.676
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.513
To everyone's surprise...

40:38.643 --> 40:41.641
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

40:43.726 --> 40:46.890
The things that a madman's love can do!

40:51.685 --> 40:53.841
One day...

40:55.393 --> 40:58.723
when she could finally stand unaided...

41:00.393 --> 41:03.972
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

41:04.685 --> 41:08.382
singing a song that she had taught her.

41:10.726 --> 41:13.393
And she got emotional.

41:15.018 --> 41:20.351
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

41:21.601 --> 41:23.094
And it was...

41:23.935 --> 41:27.217
like feeling she was alive again.

42:04.101 --> 42:06.768
When she opened the window...

42:08.310 --> 42:12.350
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

42:20.310 --> 42:23.178
She didn't look human.

42:23.768 --> 42:26.173
She was a cinder.

42:29.935 --> 42:32.554
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

42:32.726 --> 42:34.883
and threw herself out the window.

42:47.476 --> 42:50.474
Years later, little Norma...

42:51.518 --> 42:54.551
went in search of her mother...

42:55.810 --> 42:59.720
along the same road
her mother had taken.

43:02.643 --> 43:04.799
Through the window.

43:44.435 --> 43:47.635
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

43:47.768 --> 43:49.261
Did you pray?

43:49.351 --> 43:52.598
Yes.
Everything you told me.

43:57.810 --> 43:59.682
Shall we go inside?

44:38.268 --> 44:41.053
Do you mind if we
leave it

44:41.143 --> 44:42.766
for tomorrow?

44:44.226 --> 44:47.224
The tiger really messed me up.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.885
As you wish.

44:53.768 --> 44:55.391
But hold me!

45:02.393 --> 45:04.882
Don't worry, I'll wait.

45:05.768 --> 45:08.636
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

45:09.101 --> 45:10.642
Thank you!

45:26.143 --> 45:28.513
I'm falling asleep.

45:36.018 --> 45:38.056
Sleep, my love.

45:58.518 --> 46:00.260
SIX YEARS EARLIER

46:32.476 --> 46:34.846
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

46:34.935 --> 46:37.554
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

46:39.976 --> 46:42.595
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

46:42.726 --> 46:45.132
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

46:51.893 --> 46:54.761
Your daughter is getting on well
with my nieces.

46:55.476 --> 46:57.218
She seems much better...

46:57.393 --> 47:00.095
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

47:00.685 --> 47:03.801
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

47:03.893 --> 47:07.223
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

47:21.143 --> 47:22.636
To you!

48:14.060 --> 48:16.595
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

48:16.643 --> 48:18.266
Enjoy him, darling.

48:30.810 --> 48:32.219
Excuse me.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.218
Norma!

50:43.351 --> 50:44.892
Norma!

50:45.310 --> 50:47.051
Norma!

50:47.268 --> 50:48.891
Norma!

50:49.060 --> 50:50.636
Norma!

50:50.851 --> 50:54.299
Sweetheart, it's me!

50:59.226 --> 51:01.715
There, there!

52:09.810 --> 52:11.007
What about this one?

52:11.101 --> 52:12.298
Yes, but...

52:12.393 --> 52:13.555
no.

52:13.685 --> 52:14.798
And it looks a bit old.

52:14.893 --> 52:17.097
It's not old, it's vintage.

52:17.185 --> 52:19.638
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

52:19.726 --> 52:22.215
No flowers.
Something like this?

52:22.351 --> 52:23.844
Not stripes either.

52:23.976 --> 52:25.350
No stripes.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.100
Something graphic?

52:38.226 --> 52:40.845
Graphic?
Like this?

52:40.893 --> 52:42.848
I'll come back another day.

52:42.935 --> 52:46.051
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

52:49.935 --> 52:51.096
Cristina...

52:52.101 --> 52:54.092
Here. On the house.

52:54.185 --> 52:56.092
Put it on and we'll go partying.

52:56.226 --> 52:57.767
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

52:57.935 --> 53:00.506
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

53:02.143 --> 53:04.217
It'll look great on you.

53:04.351 --> 53:06.342
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

53:07.476 --> 53:09.183
You're so mistaken!

53:09.268 --> 53:11.175
Because I don't like men?

53:11.435 --> 53:13.556
Because you don't like me.

53:14.226 --> 53:15.803
In any case...

53:16.268 --> 53:19.634
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

53:19.768 --> 53:21.806
You shouldn't take that shit.

53:24.976 --> 53:27.050
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

53:27.851 --> 53:29.392
I'm off.

53:29.851 --> 53:31.225
Where to?

53:31.351 --> 53:32.725
Home, to get changed.

53:32.810 --> 53:34.054
How come?

53:34.643 --> 53:35.673
I'm meeting my pals.

53:35.768 --> 53:38.304
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

53:38.518 --> 53:39.548
Were you invited?

53:39.643 --> 53:41.717
Jorge knows one of the nieces.

53:41.810 --> 53:43.551
We're just going to the dance.

53:44.435 --> 53:46.840
Well? Are you coming?

53:47.101 --> 53:49.258
Leave her alone, you pain.

53:51.185 --> 53:52.512
Good afternoon.

53:52.685 --> 53:54.142
Hello.

53:55.476 --> 53:57.597
My wife has left us...

53:57.685 --> 54:00.220
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

54:01.060 --> 54:03.264
- Josefina?
- Yes.

54:04.810 --> 54:06.184
Well...

54:06.393 --> 54:08.597
we don't have anything for fat women...

54:10.143 --> 54:14.808
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

54:14.893 --> 54:16.551
They're very nice.

54:16.893 --> 54:18.884
We'll look at them and let you know.

54:19.018 --> 54:22.597
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

54:22.643 --> 54:23.591
Yes.
It's heavy.

54:23.685 --> 54:25.094
It certainly is.

54:25.185 --> 54:26.559
But...

54:26.976 --> 54:29.263
did she leave or has she disappeared?

54:29.476 --> 54:31.432
Both things.
To be honest...

54:31.518 --> 54:34.516
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

54:34.601 --> 54:36.308
So the next time she does it...

54:36.393 --> 54:39.474
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

55:25.685 --> 55:28.173
I'll show you the garden.

55:28.268 --> 55:31.017
What a party!

55:31.143 --> 55:32.600
Fresh air!

55:34.351 --> 55:37.385
You're all stoners!

55:40.560 --> 55:42.266
I'm Vicente.

55:43.143 --> 55:44.719
I'm Norma.

55:48.851 --> 55:50.641
Your friends have gone.

55:51.851 --> 55:54.138
All the better, right?

56:07.310 --> 56:08.802
Are you stoned?

56:09.518 --> 56:10.927
Stoned?

56:11.435 --> 56:13.390
Have you taken any pills?

56:14.101 --> 56:15.891
Yes.

56:16.518 --> 56:18.509
Cipralex 20...

56:19.476 --> 56:22.309
100 mg of Deprax...

56:23.601 --> 56:25.675
2 g of Trankimazin.

56:25.768 --> 56:27.426
I don't take Rohipnol now.

56:27.810 --> 56:30.263
And Lyrica, of course.

56:30.393 --> 56:31.672
Shit!

56:31.810 --> 56:33.765
I'm high as hell too.

56:33.893 --> 56:35.220
High?

56:35.685 --> 56:37.094
Yes.

56:42.101 --> 56:44.009
You're not from here, are you?

56:44.143 --> 56:46.217
No. Are you?

56:46.518 --> 56:49.137
Yes, but I want to get away...

57:08.185 --> 57:10.969
I'm sick of these high heels!

57:16.893 --> 57:18.469
And this jacket!

57:19.976 --> 57:23.887
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

57:24.310 --> 57:28.090
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

57:30.351 --> 57:31.631
Wait.

57:32.643 --> 57:34.349
I'll leave you naked.

58:14.643 --> 58:16.385
You're so pretty...

58:18.268 --> 58:19.809
and different.

58:21.976 --> 58:23.683
I'm different too.

58:24.060 --> 58:26.134
Are you in treatment too?

58:27.935 --> 58:29.013
No.

58:29.101 --> 58:31.139
Do you think I should be?

58:31.226 --> 58:32.636
I don't know.

58:33.310 --> 58:36.841
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

58:37.018 --> 58:38.345
"I Need To Love".

58:38.435 --> 58:40.390
This is also for the bride...

58:40.518 --> 58:42.260
with all my affection.

59:41.768 --> 59:47.054
No!

59:51.935 --> 59:53.972
Shut up!

59:56.435 --> 59:58.591
Stop!

01:01:32.893 --> 01:01:34.434
Cristina...

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.807
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

01:01:38.101 --> 01:01:39.475
Yes...

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.349
but where are you going?

01:01:41.435 --> 01:01:44.386
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.136
That's because of all the stuff you take.

01:01:46.185 --> 01:01:47.677
I haven't taken anything in a week.

01:01:47.768 --> 01:01:49.391
Then it's because of that.

01:01:50.143 --> 01:01:52.264
So should I take it or not?

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:53.850
It's best not to.

01:01:55.768 --> 01:01:57.309
I'm going out.

01:01:57.768 --> 01:01:59.675
Now? Without finishing it?

01:01:59.726 --> 01:02:00.674
Yes.

01:02:03.185 --> 01:02:05.969
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.762
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:11.843
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:15.139
Are you leaving that mess?

01:02:15.185 --> 01:02:17.638
I'll finish it tomorrow.

01:03:12.018 --> 01:03:15.218
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

01:03:56.143 --> 01:03:57.766
Son of a bitch!

01:03:58.685 --> 01:04:01.090
Bastard!

01:04:09.268 --> 01:04:10.809
Are you crazy?

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.223
Don't shoot!

01:06:10.268 --> 01:06:12.389
Help!

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.052
<i>Help!</i>

01:06:30.393 --> 01:06:31.802
Come in.

01:06:33.768 --> 01:06:35.095
Sit down, please.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.469
Thank you.

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:42.509
I was told there's news.

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:48.093
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

01:06:49.768 --> 01:06:51.344
And the body?

01:06:51.768 --> 01:06:53.095
Nothing.

01:06:53.601 --> 01:06:55.758
It must have been washed out to sea.

01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:02.141
We're very sorry, ma'am.

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:05.058
My son is alive.

01:07:06.726 --> 01:07:09.890
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

01:07:09.935 --> 01:07:11.558
but my son?

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.548
He could have been kidnapped.

01:07:18.226 --> 01:07:21.592
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:23.640
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

01:07:23.726 --> 01:07:27.767
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

01:07:27.851 --> 01:07:30.422
If he is, he's far away.

01:07:32.601 --> 01:07:35.801
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

01:07:35.893 --> 01:07:39.093
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

01:07:39.143 --> 01:07:40.885
But he said he'd be home for supper.

01:07:40.935 --> 01:07:42.262
Cristina heard him.

01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:45.883
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

01:08:03.185 --> 01:08:05.140
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

01:08:19.768 --> 01:08:23.465
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

01:08:26.518 --> 01:08:28.591
Norma...

01:08:30.475 --> 01:08:32.804
Sweetheart...

01:08:32.893 --> 01:08:35.844
I won't touch you.

01:08:38.143 --> 01:08:39.719
Where are you going?

01:08:46.643 --> 01:08:48.349
Where are you going?

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.384
Norma, love.

01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:03.970
Everything OK?

01:09:04.018 --> 01:09:06.423
Yes.

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.801
It's me, Norma.

01:09:12.893 --> 01:09:15.216
You can come out,
the men have gone.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:19.392
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

01:09:19.475 --> 01:09:20.969
We tried...

01:09:21.518 --> 01:09:24.635
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.385
She rips it off.

01:09:28.185 --> 01:09:32.261
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

01:09:33.393 --> 01:09:36.675
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:38.925
And she gets worse when she sees you.

01:09:39.018 --> 01:09:42.051
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

01:09:42.185 --> 01:09:43.559
I just found her lying there!

01:09:43.643 --> 01:09:46.013
Why can't you get that into her head?

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.850
She identifies you with the rapist.

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:51.214
Maybe...

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:54.176
we let her out too soon.

01:09:54.351 --> 01:09:56.970
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

01:09:57.018 --> 01:09:59.637
She was getting over her social phobia.

01:09:59.768 --> 01:10:00.798
How could I know...

01:10:00.851 --> 01:10:03.802
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:34.681
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:37.683
Help!
Get me out of here!

01:11:38.851 --> 01:11:42.431
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

01:11:42.851 --> 01:11:44.641
You'll eat and drink now.

01:11:44.726 --> 01:11:47.843
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

01:11:47.976 --> 01:11:51.058
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

01:11:52.018 --> 01:11:54.802
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

01:12:06.226 --> 01:12:07.600
Turn around!

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.095
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:44.509
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

01:12:45.518 --> 01:12:47.639
You'll be more comfortable there.

01:13:24.893 --> 01:13:26.386
Eat.

01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:29.219
Thank you!

01:13:35.226 --> 01:13:37.466
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:40.763
I've been alone for so long.

01:13:43.643 --> 01:13:46.843
Wait, please! Don't go!

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:53.049
Please, don't go!

01:13:53.226 --> 01:13:55.264
We have to talk.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:24.684
My condolences.

01:14:28.185 --> 01:14:30.175
We did what we could.

01:14:30.476 --> 01:14:32.965
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.973
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:36.683
for homicidal negligence.

01:14:36.726 --> 01:14:39.475
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

01:14:43.185 --> 01:14:45.010
You really want to work today?

01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:46.263
Yes.

01:14:46.393 --> 01:14:49.510
You should rest and try to forget.

01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:52.683
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

01:14:52.768 --> 01:14:55.257
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

01:15:13.393 --> 01:15:15.384
My mother will be very worried.

01:15:16.143 --> 01:15:18.632
I never stay away without calling her.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.634
You have a daughter, haven't you?

01:15:36.726 --> 01:15:38.468
Why do you say that?

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.967
The toys...

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.801
My daughter is dead.

01:15:45.601 --> 01:15:48.172
We buried her today.

01:15:50.768 --> 01:15:52.675
I'm sorry.

01:16:01.768 --> 01:16:04.435
And now, some aftershave.

01:16:07.143 --> 01:16:09.181
Why did you shave me?

01:16:09.643 --> 01:16:11.634
That's a good question.

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.055
Yes?

01:17:06.101 --> 01:17:07.475
<i>It's us.</i>

01:17:07.601 --> 01:17:09.011
I'll let you in.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.719
If he says we're late,

01:17:29.768 --> 01:17:32.008
say there were two
accidents on the road

01:17:32.268 --> 01:17:34.140
You know how he is about punctuality.

01:17:37.601 --> 01:17:39.224
Good evening.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:40.637
You're late.

01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:42.635
There were two accidents on the road.

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.726
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:48.133
When you're ready, we'll start.

01:17:48.643 --> 01:17:52.517
Two accidents, one near that town...

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:36.806
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

01:18:37.601 --> 01:18:39.308
He isn't.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.223
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:46.349
It's a particularly confidential case.

01:19:21.851 --> 01:19:23.807
What's happened?

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:30.390
What did you do to me?

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.299
A vaginoplasty

01:19:42.601 --> 01:19:44.473
No...

01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:33.970
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.683
It's very important.

01:20:38.018 --> 01:20:41.348
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:46.300
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

01:20:46.393 --> 01:20:49.557
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:51.089
You...

01:20:52.393 --> 01:20:55.225
You have to keep the new orifice open...

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:58.675
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:04.432
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

01:21:04.518 --> 01:21:06.888
that you breathe through it.

01:21:08.601 --> 01:21:09.975
In this case...

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.760
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

01:21:17.268 --> 01:21:21.641
Start by inserting the smallest one.

01:21:23.976 --> 01:21:26.216
It will hurt at first...

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.595
but in a few months...

01:21:29.726 --> 01:21:32.808
the largest one will fit without any effort...

01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:34.641
and the skin...

01:21:34.810 --> 01:21:38.886
will be perfectly healed.

01:21:47.351 --> 01:21:50.966
This is very good.

01:21:52.768 --> 01:21:55.221
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.968
Four weeks.

01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:58.850
Can I go now?

01:21:59.268 --> 01:22:01.839
- Go where?
- Home.

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:04.307
But we've just started.

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:21.182
What else are you going to do?

01:22:23.226 --> 01:22:25.845
You'll see, when the time comes.

01:22:28.018 --> 01:22:30.305
Why are you doing this?

01:22:38.185 --> 01:22:40.720
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

01:22:41.893 --> 01:22:44.428
In that spectacular house?

01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:50.052
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

01:22:51.643 --> 01:22:53.681
I don't think I actually raped her.

01:22:53.726 --> 01:22:58.051
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

01:22:59.018 --> 01:23:03.889
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:08.473
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.349
What are you going to do now?

01:23:31.393 --> 01:23:35.173
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

01:23:39.018 --> 01:23:42.466
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.767
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

01:23:55.601 --> 01:23:58.469
The marks on your skin will disappear.

01:23:59.101 --> 01:24:01.555
There's still work to do.

01:24:02.643 --> 01:24:07.099
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:14.592
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

01:24:14.685 --> 01:24:18.015
It'll also give you support
and mould you.

01:24:18.685 --> 01:24:22.974
Get used to wearing it all the time...

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:25.761
like a second skin.

01:24:27.185 --> 01:24:28.725
Put it on.

01:25:14.226 --> 01:25:16.513
Will you zip me up, please?

01:25:36.976 --> 01:25:38.303
Bitch!

01:26:26.935 --> 01:26:28.309
Stop!

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:32.090
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

01:26:34.226 --> 01:26:35.933
Stay where you are!

01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:53.635
I'll slit my throat...

01:26:53.685 --> 01:26:55.759
and then you'll have no toy!

01:26:56.935 --> 01:26:58.676
You wouldn't dare.

01:27:33.685 --> 01:27:35.474
We were lucky.

01:27:37.226 --> 01:27:39.016
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

01:28:22.935 --> 01:28:25.719
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

01:28:28.726 --> 01:28:33.051
From today, your name is Vera.

01:30:20.185 --> 01:30:22.590
I don't know if you're there.

01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:25.090
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

01:30:25.185 --> 01:30:26.843
Do what you want with them.

01:30:49.643 --> 01:30:52.214
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...</i>

01:30:52.268 --> 01:30:55.136
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.</i>

01:31:15.726 --> 01:31:18.926
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...</i>

01:31:19.393 --> 01:31:22.177
<i>a place inside you...</i>

01:31:22.268 --> 01:31:24.058
<i>a place to which...</i>

01:31:24.143 --> 01:31:26.466
<i>no one else has access...</i>

01:31:26.518 --> 01:31:29.185
<i>a place that no one can destroy.</i>

01:31:29.726 --> 01:31:32.013
<i>To access that place there is yoga...</i>

01:31:32.268 --> 01:31:35.183
<i>an ancient technique.</i>

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:39.556
<i>It's a place where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquillity...</i>

01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:41.224
<i>freedom.</i>

01:31:41.351 --> 01:31:43.058
<i>But you must practice it...</i>

01:31:43.143 --> 01:31:45.762
<i>continuously, intensely...</i>

01:31:45.851 --> 01:31:50.176
<i>and then you'll achieve it.</i>

01:31:50.643 --> 01:31:52.634
YOGA BOOKS

01:32:53.976 --> 01:32:55.884
My Cigarral!

01:32:56.726 --> 01:32:58.634
I missed it so much!

01:33:00.185 --> 01:33:02.887
These four years seemed eternal!

01:33:03.018 --> 01:33:06.715
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

01:33:07.268 --> 01:33:09.935
I thought you'd forgotten me.

01:33:10.768 --> 01:33:12.474
I thought that...

01:33:12.643 --> 01:33:15.890
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

01:33:16.435 --> 01:33:18.591
My poor child.

01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:20.925
To throw herself out the window!

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.465
I'd rather not talk about it.

01:33:24.143 --> 01:33:26.015
As you wish.

01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:29.423
But I'm going to miss her so much!

01:33:31.268 --> 01:33:33.223
Let's go to the kitchen.

01:33:33.643 --> 01:33:35.052
I'm parched.

01:33:39.101 --> 01:33:41.057
Don't look at the surfaces.

01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:45.174
Everything has to be cleaned.

01:33:45.393 --> 01:33:48.924
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

01:33:49.268 --> 01:33:51.638
You've installed more televisions.

01:33:51.768 --> 01:33:56.058
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

01:33:56.185 --> 01:33:57.974
I'll explain.

01:33:58.851 --> 01:34:01.340
From now on, you'll look after her.

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:05.345
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

01:34:07.351 --> 01:34:11.345
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

01:34:32.101 --> 01:34:33.808
You've put on your uniform.

01:34:34.518 --> 01:34:36.971
You don't have to wear it.

01:34:37.018 --> 01:34:38.559
I like the uniform...

01:34:38.685 --> 01:34:41.303
because it means we're together again.

01:34:49.226 --> 01:34:50.719
Who is she?

01:34:51.976 --> 01:34:54.097
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

01:34:54.893 --> 01:34:56.635
What's she doing?

01:34:57.518 --> 01:34:59.224
She's writing on the wall.

01:34:59.351 --> 01:35:01.638
I can see that.

01:35:03.393 --> 01:35:05.218
It smells of croquettes.

01:35:07.643 --> 01:35:09.847
She called me on the intercom...

01:35:09.976 --> 01:35:12.761
and asked who I was and what day it was.

01:35:13.143 --> 01:35:16.094
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

01:35:17.768 --> 01:35:20.719
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:25.676
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

01:35:26.518 --> 01:35:28.804
She reminds me of someone.

01:35:28.935 --> 01:35:32.596
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:36.934
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

01:35:48.143 --> 01:35:51.591
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

01:36:03.935 --> 01:36:06.637
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:21.841
BACK TO THE PRESENT

01:36:26.476 --> 01:36:29.261
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.178
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:36.099
I don't trust you.

01:36:36.435 --> 01:36:39.635
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

01:36:40.935 --> 01:36:42.475
Pass me the tray.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.593
No. I'll take it up.

01:36:50.101 --> 01:36:52.590
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

01:36:53.976 --> 01:36:55.469
Thank you.

01:37:58.018 --> 01:37:59.760
Good morning.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.266
Breakfast.

01:38:10.768 --> 01:38:12.558
Thank you.

01:38:22.476 --> 01:38:24.348
Where's Marilia?

01:38:24.518 --> 01:38:26.556
In the kitchen, grumbling.

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:30.932
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

01:38:41.435 --> 01:38:43.093
Last night...

01:38:43.935 --> 01:38:45.807
before we went to bed...

01:38:45.935 --> 01:38:48.849
we talked a lot and we made a promise.

01:38:50.393 --> 01:38:53.675
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

01:38:55.643 --> 01:38:58.760
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.178
that I could see all the TV channels...

01:39:03.351 --> 01:39:05.472
that I was free.

01:39:07.601 --> 01:39:10.635
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

01:39:11.893 --> 01:39:13.848
Don't let me down.

01:39:14.435 --> 01:39:16.888
It's all I have, Robert.

01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:19.758
Your promise and mine.

01:39:29.143 --> 01:39:31.892
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

01:39:33.018 --> 01:39:36.466
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.301
She promised not to.

01:39:38.393 --> 01:39:41.640
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:46.013
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.636
That's enough!

01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:52.924
I'm sorry I took so long.

01:39:53.851 --> 01:39:56.849
I've put on high heels to practice.

01:39:57.310 --> 01:40:00.758
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

01:40:00.935 --> 01:40:02.511
Thank you.

01:40:18.518 --> 01:40:20.176
Come along, child!

01:40:26.643 --> 01:40:28.681
Have you a problem with me?

01:40:29.226 --> 01:40:32.509
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

01:40:34.268 --> 01:40:37.634
I want to talk about the clinic.

01:40:37.851 --> 01:40:39.842
I told you on the phone.

01:40:40.726 --> 01:40:42.349
After talking to the president...

01:40:42.435 --> 01:40:45.931
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

01:40:47.685 --> 01:40:50.599
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:52.308
It's not just that.

01:40:52.601 --> 01:40:56.382
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

01:40:58.101 --> 01:41:01.681
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

01:41:01.768 --> 01:41:04.600
I'm speaking for all the team.

01:41:04.726 --> 01:41:07.559
Our main patients love the isolation here.

01:41:07.601 --> 01:41:11.097
I said no, Fulgencio.

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:17.470
And now I'd like to be alone.

01:41:18.601 --> 01:41:21.765
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

01:41:55.018 --> 01:41:57.009
Are you still here?

01:41:58.393 --> 01:41:59.637
I'm leaving now...

01:41:59.768 --> 01:42:03.429
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

01:42:07.726 --> 01:42:09.433
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.716
We gave him a sex change.

01:42:12.476 --> 01:42:16.091
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:17.423
as you can see.

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.100
And?

01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:22.215
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

01:42:22.476 --> 01:42:24.266
without hormones.

01:42:24.393 --> 01:42:26.384
He only wanted a cunt.

01:42:26.893 --> 01:42:30.306
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L. A...

01:42:30.435 --> 01:42:33.931
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:41.924
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

01:42:42.018 --> 01:42:44.174
Don't go there.

01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:46.715
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

01:42:47.143 --> 01:42:48.091
It wouldn't be the first time...

01:42:48.185 --> 01:42:50.934
we accepted false documents.

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:53.678
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

01:42:53.726 --> 01:42:56.641
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

01:42:57.310 --> 01:43:01.350
I think you kidnapped him...

01:43:01.435 --> 01:43:03.674
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

01:43:03.976 --> 01:43:05.090
You told us...

01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:07.803
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

01:43:07.893 --> 01:43:09.683
Knowing you as I do...

01:43:09.768 --> 01:43:13.098
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

01:43:13.185 --> 01:43:15.057
On Vicente, for example.

01:43:15.393 --> 01:43:19.303
Do you know what would happen to you...

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.348
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

01:43:21.435 --> 01:43:23.472
on someone you'd kidnapped?

01:43:23.518 --> 01:43:26.137
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

01:43:28.476 --> 01:43:31.012
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:37.177
Get the hell out of here!

01:43:38.643 --> 01:43:42.423
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:46.758
And...

01:43:46.851 --> 01:43:48.807
what's that transgenesis?

01:43:50.185 --> 01:43:51.926
A cream?

01:43:54.185 --> 01:43:56.851
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

01:43:58.101 --> 01:44:01.965
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:03.933
Vera Cruz!

01:44:05.351 --> 01:44:07.887
And I was always a woman!

01:44:29.976 --> 01:44:31.552
Give me a cigarette.

01:44:41.226 --> 01:44:42.968
Thank you.

01:44:43.268 --> 01:44:46.052
No, I thank you.

01:45:12.976 --> 01:45:14.718
Does it still hurt?

01:45:14.851 --> 01:45:16.427
Yes.

01:45:18.518 --> 01:45:20.509
Shall we do it from behind?

01:45:21.726 --> 01:45:24.013
Wouldn't that hurt more?

01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:26.551
- Wait...
- What?

01:45:26.643 --> 01:45:28.799
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

01:45:28.851 --> 01:45:31.387
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

01:45:46.393 --> 01:45:48.549
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

01:45:48.685 --> 01:45:49.846
but I can't find it.

01:45:49.935 --> 01:45:52.506
You must have left it downstairs.

01:45:52.685 --> 01:45:55.801
I'll go and get it.

01:46:29.435 --> 01:46:32.682
Vera!
Hurry up!

01:46:44.851 --> 01:46:47.933
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

01:46:50.435 --> 01:46:51.927
Not yet.

01:46:57.851 --> 01:46:59.225
Come on...

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:02.683
What are you doing?

01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:07.135
I'm going to kill you.

01:47:07.601 --> 01:47:09.260
This is a joke, right?

01:47:10.143 --> 01:47:11.885
Call it what you want.

01:47:13.393 --> 01:47:15.348
But you promised!

01:47:15.476 --> 01:47:17.348
I lied.

01:47:56.726 --> 01:47:58.184
Robert?

01:48:00.143 --> 01:48:01.600
Robert?

01:48:01.726 --> 01:48:03.267
He's asleep.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.301
I heard a noise.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.100
Yes, so did I.

01:48:08.476 --> 01:48:11.261
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

01:48:17.935 --> 01:48:19.511
Robert!

01:48:20.435 --> 01:48:22.093
My son!

01:48:33.143 --> 01:48:36.425
Come out of there! Bitch!

01:48:38.351 --> 01:48:40.176
Where are you?

01:48:55.351 --> 01:48:57.389
I knew it.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.183
Hello.

01:51:07.976 --> 01:51:09.967
You see to her.

01:51:12.185 --> 01:51:13.761
Good morning.

01:51:26.601 --> 01:51:28.426
What did you want?

01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:32.347
Is anything wrong?

01:51:33.435 --> 01:51:35.509
Are you all right?

01:51:39.351 --> 01:51:42.100
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

01:51:44.185 --> 01:51:46.140
Do you know me?

01:51:46.976 --> 01:51:50.804
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

01:51:51.851 --> 01:51:55.347
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

01:51:57.768 --> 01:52:00.849
I had to kill two people to get away.

01:52:02.893 --> 01:52:05.049
You have to help me.

01:52:09.976 --> 01:52:11.683
Look.

01:52:12.393 --> 01:52:14.430
Do you remember this dress?

01:52:16.726 --> 01:52:20.802
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

01:52:21.143 --> 01:52:23.264
I said I'd give it to you...

01:52:23.685 --> 01:52:26.220
just to see how it looked.

01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:30.683
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

01:52:32.726 --> 01:52:37.549
At that moment we were alone, remember?

01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:46.884
Is anything wrong?

01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:51.513
Come here a moment, ma'am.

01:53:04.768 --> 01:53:07.470
Why are you crying?

01:53:18.643 --> 01:53:21.013
I'm Vicente.
