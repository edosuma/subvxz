00:01.929 --> 00:02.870
Previously on Angel:

00:03.129 --> 00:04.780
Who is he? He's magnificent.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.990
I could show you things
you've never seen.

00:08.529 --> 00:12.570
We were together 150 years.
We shared everything.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.150
- It's Holtz.
- A vampire hunter.

00:15.730 --> 00:17.870
How does he keep finding us?
We have a message for your husband.

00:18.129 --> 00:20.410
- You remember Caroline.
- Hardy screamer.

00:21.129 --> 00:23.870
It'll be 200 years
before you find Angelus.

00:24.129 --> 00:26.480
I want your word
you will show no mercy.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.059
That's her. Darla. She's back.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.719
God doesn't want you, but I still do.

00:33.130 --> 00:35.829
- You still have a soul.
- Get out.

00:36.729 --> 00:38.979
- It's impossible.
- Tell me about it, Daddy.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.990
- You're carrying a boy.
- Great.

00:41.530 --> 00:42.899
No one knows how Darla's pregnant.

00:43.329 --> 00:46.979
Prophecies mention a Tro-Clon
bringing the ruination of mankind.

00:47.530 --> 00:49.350
But the scroll is missing.

00:49.929 --> 00:51.399
Her water's broken.

00:51.729 --> 00:53.689
Get this baby
before anybody finds out.

00:54.130 --> 00:57.500
I don't care who that man is.
Take him out now.

00:59.530 --> 01:02.789
Angelus. I've been looking for you.

01:06.129 --> 01:07.569
Holtz.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.000
My God.

01:10.329 --> 01:12.049
You have no god, demon.

01:15.129 --> 01:16.359
The Tro-Clon.

01:16.930 --> 01:21.459
The prophecy. "Raised up
from darkness to bring darkness."

01:22.930 --> 01:26.579
It's you.
Holtz, whatever brought you here--

01:30.730 --> 01:31.780
You did.

01:34.329 --> 01:36.959
You and your demon bitch.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.950
For 200 years I slept.

01:42.730 --> 01:48.170
For 200 years I dreamt of nothing,
but this moment.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.849
Which would explain
why you look so well-rested.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.609
You haven't changed.

01:54.730 --> 01:59.370
Actually, I have. While you
were sleeping, a lot changed.

02:00.129 --> 02:01.359
Really?

02:07.329 --> 02:10.908
- Somehow things seem the same to me.
- You're wrong.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.759
I will have justice.

02:18.129 --> 02:23.469
No. I don't think you will. There's no
justice for the things I did to you.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.879
You didn't do them to me.

02:30.129 --> 02:32.479
And you didn't do them alone.

02:32.530 --> 02:36.740
Find the female.
If he's here, Darla can't be far.

02:37.930 --> 02:41.159
Or are you going to tell me
that's changed too?

02:46.330 --> 02:50.159
- She's gonna pop right here.
- The contractions are more frequent.

02:50.530 --> 02:51.610
You think?

02:52.330 --> 02:56.120
Angel not back with the scrolls?
The prophecies would guide us.

02:56.530 --> 02:59.340
Women have given birth
without them for years.

03:00.129 --> 03:03.539
We could really use Vaseline
and a catcher's mitt.

03:04.330 --> 03:09.530
She's not ready to deliver, but she's
moved into the active stage of labor.

03:12.729 --> 03:14.800
We can't stay. It's too exposed.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.340
- He should have been back.
- Something happened.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.800
It's up to us to protect
his unborn child.

03:21.129 --> 03:26.400
Darla, we're taking you out of here.
Relax. Try to breathe, like this:

03:31.330 --> 03:32.659
I don't...

03:35.530 --> 03:37.419
...breathe!

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074

05:05.050 --> 05:06.560
Papa?

05:08.050 --> 05:09.560
Papa.

05:14.649 --> 05:15.879
Sarah?

05:18.850 --> 05:20.180
Sarah.

05:22.449 --> 05:25.399
- Sarah.
- Mommy won't wake up.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.990
Quiet now.

06:05.649 --> 06:07.579
- Captain--
- Don't come in here.

06:10.449 --> 06:12.699
- Sweet Jesus.
- Get out!

06:51.250 --> 06:54.550
We have no idea who he is.
We ran the surveillance tapes...

06:55.449 --> 06:59.310
...through face and voice recognition.
He's not in the system.

06:59.649 --> 07:01.329
- A new player.
- Or an old one.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.189
- Go.
- He addressed Angel as Angelus.

07:04.449 --> 07:06.240
That suggests personal history.

07:06.850 --> 07:11.350
- An old friend.
- Not likely. Angelus had no friends.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.439
- The status of our surveillance?
- We're working on it.

07:15.850 --> 07:18.620
You hear from Cmdr. Burke
or Dr. Fetvanovich?

07:19.449 --> 07:22.470
Units were deployed in Angel's hotel,
but that's all we know.

07:23.050 --> 07:26.600
Actually, that's all you know.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.569
- I, on the other hand, know nothing.
- Sir?

07:32.050 --> 07:34.470
I could never have been involved...

07:35.050 --> 07:37.860
...in such an ill-conceived
and, in the end, botched operation.

07:38.649 --> 07:41.839
- Because you were never here.
- Correct.

07:42.250 --> 07:45.899
- But we were.
- You were.

07:46.449 --> 07:49.930
I'll expect a full report
at Thursday's staff meeting.

07:50.649 --> 07:54.970
When I hear about this for the first
time, I will be shocked and appalled.

07:56.050 --> 07:57.519
Good night.

07:57.850 --> 07:59.670
He's gonna crucify us.

08:00.250 --> 08:04.250
They don't crucify here.
It's too Christian.

08:09.009 --> 08:12.980
You're still human.
How'd you manage this?

08:13.810 --> 08:16.089
So the question becomes:

08:17.410 --> 08:20.740
Now that I have you,
what's the best way to get her?

08:21.009 --> 08:24.660
- Only dark magics could bring you.
- She was the trick, not you.

08:25.209 --> 08:30.620
- Darla was the unpredictable one.
- Was it a demon or something else?

08:31.810 --> 08:36.940
What if I just kill you now?
Would she somehow sense it?

08:37.808 --> 08:41.000
Would that bring her bursting in
through those doors?

08:41.409 --> 08:43.509
Did something come to you
or did you seek it?

08:44.409 --> 08:47.990
She might show herself
in the service of revenge.

08:48.610 --> 08:51.309
- It can be a powerful motivator.
- Yes, it can.

08:51.610 --> 08:54.940
What'd you have to give up
for this second chance?

08:56.409 --> 09:00.690
Give up? I had nothing to give up.

09:01.210 --> 09:02.789
You saw to that.

09:04.809 --> 09:09.659
We took a lot from you, that's true.
But we didn't get everything.

09:10.210 --> 09:13.620
- We couldn't take your soul.
- What do you know of a soul?

09:14.409 --> 09:16.409
I know yours will be destroyed...

09:16.809 --> 09:20.529
...if you allow yourself to be used
in the service of evil.

09:22.210 --> 09:25.440
You're a good man, Holtz.
A righteous man.

09:26.409 --> 09:31.120
And you're being used
for some purpose other than justice.

09:31.809 --> 09:35.110
Could it be you really have changed?

09:36.610 --> 09:39.870
I don't remember you ever
pleading so cravenly before.

09:40.210 --> 09:43.120
And I remember you used
to work with men.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.779
Smack him again.

09:57.009 --> 09:58.730
That hurts.

09:58.809 --> 10:01.899
Well, you know what they say,
birth, painful.

10:02.409 --> 10:06.269
Generally for mothers, not bystanders.
How long have I been out?

10:07.210 --> 10:10.789
Not long. But we seem
to be between contractions now.

10:13.210 --> 10:17.250
- Yeah, she's been doing that.
- Hormones.

10:18.610 --> 10:23.559
Come on, then. Darla,
do you feel well enough to travel?

10:25.210 --> 10:26.649
Good.

10:30.610 --> 10:33.490
Doesn't anyone want
to sit back here with me?

10:33.610 --> 10:36.279
- We're good.
- Yeah, it's comfy.

10:38.409 --> 10:43.080
I promise I won't throw anyone out
of the car. Not while it's moving.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.879
It's not that we don't trust you.
I mean, we don't trust you.

10:48.610 --> 10:52.399
But the fact is, your water
broke all over the back seat.

10:57.610 --> 11:00.870
What? What are you waiting for?

11:01.210 --> 11:04.539
- I presume we have a tire iron.
- Yeah, why? We got a flat?

11:05.409 --> 11:09.200
And how about a hurling ax
or some sort of heavy mallet?

11:13.210 --> 11:17.279
Also, a shotgun wouldn't be
a terrible thing at this juncture.

11:26.289 --> 11:31.210
Are you still concerned about my soul,
Angelus, my vampire priest?

11:35.289 --> 11:36.970
Excuse me.

11:40.690 --> 11:44.100
You've got her? Good.
Bring her in.

11:47.889 --> 11:49.610
Lilah.

11:50.289 --> 11:52.289
This isn't her.

11:56.289 --> 11:59.059
- She isn't even a vampire.
- No, I'm an attorney.

11:59.289 --> 12:03.330
Let me guess. Dead guys all over
my floor.... Friends of yours?

12:04.090 --> 12:07.740
If I knew you were torturing him,
I wouldn't have interrupted.

12:08.289 --> 12:11.620
- I'll wait until you're finished.
- He'll be dead by then.

12:12.490 --> 12:15.090
- Really?
- You say you're an attorney.

12:15.490 --> 12:18.019
You deal in man's laws.
I deal in God's.

12:18.490 --> 12:21.159
Ah, right. A good guy.

12:22.690 --> 12:24.019
Do you know what he is?

12:24.490 --> 12:27.649
Vampire cursed by gypsies
who restored his soul...

12:28.090 --> 12:31.809
...destined to atone for centuries
of evil, wacky sidekicks.

12:32.889 --> 12:36.750
I'd have him killed myself, except
my employers have this "policy."

12:40.690 --> 12:44.129
- What does she mean, cursed by gypsies?
- Long story, Holtz.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.330
I'll leave for 20 seconds.
That should give you enough time.

12:49.090 --> 12:53.440
I'll find people to clean this mess.
I've got an early meeting.

12:54.490 --> 12:58.179
- I can't allow you to leave.
- What do you mean? Sure, you can.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.690
You said you worked for the law.

13:01.090 --> 13:04.179
No, I didn't. I said I'm a lawyer.
I don't care about the law.

13:04.690 --> 13:06.899
- Lilah?
- What?

13:07.690 --> 13:09.090
Duck.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.539
Search the grounds!

13:29.289 --> 13:31.850
The men you sent
to kill Angelus were brave.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.110
- Good.
- They fought to the last.

13:34.690 --> 13:35.809
I get that.

13:35.889 --> 13:38.940
Send more, I'll do the same.
No one will have him but me.

13:39.490 --> 13:43.879
They weren't sent for Angel.
This was meant for his girlfriend.

13:47.289 --> 13:49.570
- You know of Darla?
- Sure.

13:50.289 --> 13:54.789
Tell me, these gypsies,
did they curse her as well?

13:55.690 --> 14:00.360
- Has she too been re-ensouled?
- Darla? No. She's free-range evil.

14:03.490 --> 14:06.899
If you do catch up with her,
we can do some business.

14:07.690 --> 14:13.169
My only business with Darla is to send
her back to the hell that made her.

14:15.490 --> 14:17.879
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

14:20.289 --> 14:23.450
Harvey? It's Lilah.
I got a job for you.

14:24.490 --> 14:28.769
Angel Investigations.
Yeah. Full cleaner service.

14:31.090 --> 14:32.600
Thanks.

14:39.889 --> 14:43.149
- Keep them away from the car!
- Don't let them get behind you!

14:57.289 --> 14:58.799
Charles!

14:59.090 --> 15:00.559
Thanks.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.190
What are we looking at?

15:41.090 --> 15:42.139
- Holtz?
- Yeah.

15:42.289 --> 15:45.659
- Who hunted you through--
- The late 1700s.

15:46.490 --> 15:50.039
- It wasn't his great-great-grandson?
- No, it was him.

15:50.690 --> 15:53.250
Maybe he's the one
to rain down ruination.

15:53.690 --> 15:57.590
The prophecies said the Tro-Clon
would be a confluence of events.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.090
And an 18th-century
vampire hunter appearing...

16:01.490 --> 16:03.629
...in the 21st century
seems con-fluey.

16:03.889 --> 16:06.240
- He's here for the baby?
- He doesn't know about it.

16:06.889 --> 16:10.889
He wouldn't have to. That's the tragic
beauty of a cosmic convergence.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.789
He just plays his own small part.

16:14.090 --> 16:17.950
He's looking for Angel and Darla
and finds Angel's unborn child...

16:18.889 --> 16:20.960
...who wasn't evil as we feared...

16:21.289 --> 16:24.059
...but was meant
to be some messianic figure.

16:24.289 --> 16:29.240
But Holtz kills it and his vengeance
somehow triggers the end of the world.

16:32.690 --> 16:35.500
Or not. It could go either way.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.080
Have you thought of a name yet?

16:38.690 --> 16:40.620
We must find Darla before Holtz does.

16:41.090 --> 16:42.950
- I'll find her faster alone.
- Of course.

16:43.490 --> 16:46.330
Find a safe place for her
to have this baby.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.950
We can do that.

16:50.090 --> 16:53.179
Hey. Be careful.

16:53.690 --> 16:55.440
Angel, the scrolls.
You didn't manage to...?

16:55.490 --> 16:56.360
No.

16:59.690 --> 17:02.039
I'm sure we'll be fine without them.

17:03.809 --> 17:05.039
Nyazian.

17:06.210 --> 17:09.539
Exquisite. I recognize
the Ga-Shundi cross-text.

17:11.009 --> 17:13.569
Quite a find.
Do you know what this is worth?

17:14.009 --> 17:18.509
Hopefully enough to cover my ass.
These notes should speed things up.

17:19.410 --> 17:23.730
Another translator worked on this.
I don't recognize the handwriting.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.420
- The idiom indicates an Englishman.
- I don't know. I don't remember.

17:30.809 --> 17:34.670
It wasn't that worm Forsche
in Ancient Symbols and Icons, was it?

17:35.609 --> 17:39.049
- It was somebody else.
- He's only got that one eye.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.339
Don't worry about it.
Outside contractors.

17:42.809 --> 17:45.160
I highlighted the part
they concentrated on.

17:45.809 --> 17:49.390
- You highlighted an ancient scroll?
- In yellow.

17:51.210 --> 17:52.609
Can you translate it?

17:53.009 --> 17:57.329
With sacred prophecies, it's more
an interpretation than a translation.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.509
I'm just looking for the gist.
What does it say?

18:00.809 --> 18:02.740
Let's see.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.859
"Bring forth...

18:05.609 --> 18:08.450
...appear...born."
Something about a birth.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.559
- What about the birth?
- It's unclear.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.099
Make it clear.

18:14.609 --> 18:19.029
- Well, this should be fun.
- No, it shouldn't be fun.

18:20.009 --> 18:24.609
What it should be is done by morning.
Or I'll have your family killed.

18:25.410 --> 18:28.109
You knew. You knew,
and you didn't tell me.

18:28.410 --> 18:32.829
So I left out one teeny-weeny detail.
Didn't seem all that important.

18:33.809 --> 18:36.299
Not important? Angelus with a soul?

18:36.809 --> 18:40.390
- It doesn't mean anything.
- It means everything.

18:41.009 --> 18:43.359
See? This is why I didn't mention it.

18:44.009 --> 18:48.079
So Angel has a soul. Big whoop.
So did Attila the Hun.

18:48.809 --> 18:51.619
And a big heart
when it came to gift-giving.

18:52.410 --> 18:56.099
He's still a vampire.
Angel, not Attila.

18:56.609 --> 18:58.779
- He's not the same.
- Of course he is.

18:59.609 --> 19:04.490
His hair's shorter, spikier. He's
using product. But it's the same guy.

19:05.009 --> 19:10.029
No, he's changed. He's different.

19:11.609 --> 19:16.109
I don't know what moral mind games
you've been torturing yourself with.

19:17.009 --> 19:20.769
But don't let his soul get in the way
of what you swore to do.

19:21.210 --> 19:23.950
- "Get in the way"?
- That's what this is about.

19:24.809 --> 19:29.759
Angel has a soul. Now you're wondering
if things are murkier, ethically.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.029
"Things"...

19:33.210 --> 19:35.069
...have never been clearer.

19:36.210 --> 19:39.369
Releasing his soul
to suffer for all eternity...

19:39.809 --> 19:42.859
...only makes his destruction
more just. More fitting.

19:43.410 --> 19:48.750
- Then what's the problem?
- You have me hunting the wrong prey.

19:50.009 --> 19:53.519
Ah, right. Because an Angel
with a soul...

19:54.210 --> 19:57.970
...is a slightly different challenge
than an Angel without a soul.

19:58.410 --> 20:02.480
- I must know everything.
- Right. No, got you. My mistake.

20:03.210 --> 20:05.309
You've kept nothing else
from me, then?

20:06.210 --> 20:10.490
No. Nothing I can think of.

20:19.609 --> 20:22.000
You always did love a view.

20:23.809 --> 20:27.039
Look at it. Listen to it.

20:27.410 --> 20:31.480
Can you smell it?
This world, this horrible world.

20:33.410 --> 20:36.670
Why would anyone want
to bring a baby into it?

20:38.809 --> 20:40.910
To make it better maybe?

20:41.210 --> 20:43.309
Or to destroy it finally.

20:44.210 --> 20:48.710
Why does everyone insist on planning
my son's future before he's born?

20:49.009 --> 20:52.769
All right then, how's this?
It doesn't have a future.

20:53.809 --> 20:55.769
- Darla--
- Not with me.

20:56.210 --> 20:57.289
Darla.

20:57.410 --> 20:59.410
- I can't have this baby.
- What?

20:59.809 --> 21:02.789
- I can't let it out.
- Not sure you have a lot of choice.

21:03.410 --> 21:07.099
I know it wants to come out.
I can feel it. It's ready.

21:08.210 --> 21:11.759
I can't let it.
I can't let it because....

21:12.410 --> 21:14.160
Because....

21:14.809 --> 21:16.319
You love it.

21:19.009 --> 21:23.220
Completely. I love it completely.

21:23.809 --> 21:28.200
I've never loved anything as much
as this life inside of me.

21:29.809 --> 21:33.950
Well, you've never loved
anything, Darla.

21:35.210 --> 21:39.069
That's true.
Four hundred years, and I never did.

21:40.009 --> 21:41.799
Until now.

21:44.210 --> 21:46.529
I don't know what to do.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.869
Well, you'll do the only thing
that you can do.

21:53.809 --> 21:57.710
- You'll have it. You'll have it and--
- What? We'll raise it?

21:59.210 --> 22:00.960
- Why not?
- It's impossible.

22:01.609 --> 22:04.769
This whole thing is impossible,
but it's happening.

22:05.210 --> 22:08.859
What do I have to offer a child,
a human child, besides ugly death?

22:10.009 --> 22:11.269
- Darla.
- You know it's true.

22:11.210 --> 22:13.279
I know you love our baby.

22:14.210 --> 22:17.230
You bonded with it.
You spent nine months nourishing it--

22:17.809 --> 22:21.849
I haven't been nourishing it.
I haven't given it a thing.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.240
I'm dead. It's been nourishing me.

22:26.210 --> 22:29.970
These feelings I'm having aren't mine.
They're coming from it.

22:30.410 --> 22:33.740
- You don't know that.
- Of course I do. We both do.

22:34.609 --> 22:38.539
I don't have a soul. It does.

22:39.410 --> 22:43.130
Right now, that soul is inside of me,
but soon it won't be and then...

22:43.609 --> 22:47.049
- Darla.
- ...I won't be able to love it.

22:47.809 --> 22:52.549
I won't even be able to remember that
I loved it, and I want to remember.

23:00.690 --> 23:03.990
She wants to have it here?
This is a terrible idea.

23:04.890 --> 23:08.220
Can't you see I'm getting ready
for a grand reopening?

23:09.089 --> 23:11.440
Gorsh entrails
next to the maraschinos.

23:11.490 --> 23:15.039
I can't have a baby here.
I just had the booths Simonized.

23:15.690 --> 23:18.990
Lorne, should we tell Angel and Darla
they're not welcome?

23:19.890 --> 23:23.190
Of course not. Caritas will
always be a sanctuary.

23:24.089 --> 23:27.990
That is, if some people ever finish
the work they promised to do.

23:28.289 --> 23:29.589
How's the job coming?

23:30.089 --> 23:33.599
- We'll finish by your opening tomorrow.
- New security system?

23:34.289 --> 23:37.940
Routes the new spells to prevent
both human and demon violence...

23:38.490 --> 23:40.519
...creating a carnage-free Caritas.

23:41.490 --> 23:45.490
But balancing that interspecies flux
is trickier than I expected.

23:46.289 --> 23:49.769
That's not the only tricky thing here.
You hum as you work.

23:50.490 --> 23:52.700
- Yeah, so?
- So? I just read you, buster.

23:52.890 --> 23:56.150
- What are you leaving unconnected?
- You questioning my work?

23:57.089 --> 24:01.690
- No, I'm firing you. Get out. Out.
- I'm union. Gotta pay me for the day.

24:02.490 --> 24:06.420
Out. I'll finish this myself.
How hard could this be?

24:10.289 --> 24:13.029
You won't let me hurt it, will you?

24:13.890 --> 24:17.960
You'll protect it, right?
From me, I mean?

24:26.490 --> 24:28.589
- Yeah.
- We've found a place.

24:30.089 --> 24:31.279
Is it safe?

24:32.490 --> 24:35.049
By the time you get here
it'll be safe as houses.

24:35.490 --> 24:38.049
Okay, try that.

24:39.089 --> 24:41.339
Nope, still not working.

24:41.490 --> 24:45.670
Okay. Try it now.

24:46.890 --> 24:47.799
No.

24:49.890 --> 24:53.509
Hey. Darla.

24:55.289 --> 24:58.730
We should get going.
I can feel a storm coming.

25:00.089 --> 25:03.809
You okay? Another contraction?

25:04.890 --> 25:08.329
No, it's something else.

25:12.690 --> 25:15.460
- You've got something?
- Yes, I believe I do.

25:16.289 --> 25:20.400
I must say, whoever you had working
on this before was very close.

25:21.089 --> 25:24.069
- These notes were helpful.
- Great. What does it say?

25:24.690 --> 25:29.220
He had trouble here with the tense.
Ga-Shundi tenses are tricky buggers.

25:30.089 --> 25:32.859
I'm riveted.
What does it say about the birth?

25:33.089 --> 25:37.480
- Actually, it's funny. It doesn't.
- What do you mean? You said it did.

25:38.490 --> 25:40.000
- I did.
- But it doesn't?

25:40.289 --> 25:42.569
- In a way.
- I have a gun.

25:43.289 --> 25:46.910
The prophecy is not so much a birth
announcement as it is an obituary.

25:47.490 --> 25:48.789
- Obituary?
- Yes.

25:49.289 --> 25:51.849
The prophet is telling us
there will be no birth.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.460
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

25:54.690 --> 25:58.059
"For surely in that time
when the sky opens...

25:58.890 --> 26:03.279
...and the heavens weep,
there will be no birth. Only death."

26:04.289 --> 26:06.990
- Only death?
- Just death.

26:08.490 --> 26:10.420
Just death.

26:25.049 --> 26:26.279
Captain?

26:28.650 --> 26:33.250
Captain, we beg you.
Let us take you out of this place.

26:34.650 --> 26:38.089
- It is the devil's work.
- Not the devil.

26:38.849 --> 26:40.220
Just a demon.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.859
What are we going to do?

26:56.849 --> 26:59.240
Whatever we have to.

27:10.049 --> 27:12.119
Papa, no, please! Please!

27:12.450 --> 27:15.710
No, Papa. Papa, don't! Let me go!

27:16.650 --> 27:19.880
No, Papa, no! Don't! Don't! Don't!

27:20.250 --> 27:21.930
No! No! No!

27:38.490 --> 27:42.460
Okay. I'm convinced
I got it that time.

27:46.890 --> 27:48.680
Let me see that.

27:49.890 --> 27:54.099
Just a few more steps,
that's it. Okay. All right.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.509
Guys, a chair, a chair.

27:58.890 --> 28:00.819
Jeez, what happened?

28:02.490 --> 28:03.720
Thanks.

28:07.289 --> 28:09.250
You're welcome.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.990
You gave us quite a scare.

28:13.289 --> 28:17.470
But I guess you're used to that,
what with being a scary thing and all.

28:18.089 --> 28:23.250
I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what got into me.

28:26.490 --> 28:27.750
She's in a lot of pain.

28:28.289 --> 28:31.700
- How frequent are the contractions?
- It's been an hour.

28:31.890 --> 28:34.660
She was well into
the active stage of labor.

28:35.490 --> 28:39.559
- She just stopped having them.
- But the pain she's experiencing.

28:40.289 --> 28:43.730
- She's experiencing something else.
- That's worrying.

28:45.089 --> 28:47.160
- Angel.
- Darla?

28:47.490 --> 28:51.069
- Angel.
- Let's get her to my bedroom.

28:52.289 --> 28:54.849
Easy, now.
We'll get you right in here.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.700
It's time to get to work.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.740
You found him, then?

29:05.490 --> 29:08.019
- Tell him.
- Don't forget what we discussed.

29:08.490 --> 29:09.890
You'll get your money.

29:10.289 --> 29:14.430
I got mouths to feed. Plus a family.
Some of them have mouths too.

29:15.089 --> 29:17.829
Just tell him what you heard!

29:18.690 --> 29:21.950
Lorne, should we
tell Angel and Darla they're not welcome?

29:22.289 --> 29:26.890
Of course not.
Caritas will always be a sanctuary.

29:38.849 --> 29:40.849
- She okay?
- She's tough as nails.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.369
And immortal, so that's
in her favor, healthwise.

29:44.849 --> 29:46.809
How about the baby?

29:55.049 --> 29:56.980
What? What is it?

29:57.450 --> 30:00.750
I think you need to prepare
yourself for the worst.

30:01.650 --> 30:04.670
- No.
- The baby's heartbeat is very faint.

30:05.250 --> 30:06.480
What do we do?

30:07.049 --> 30:10.740
I'm not sure we can do anything.
Her body isn't a life-giving vessel.

30:11.250 --> 30:14.970
I don't know that it's equipped
to bring a baby to term.

30:15.450 --> 30:19.519
So, what are you saying?
Just let it die?

30:22.049 --> 30:25.420
- What about a C-section?
- Normally that's what we'd do.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.940
But the mystical force that's been
protecting the pregnancy--

30:31.049 --> 30:34.529
- Is gonna end up killing it.
- That's my fear.

30:35.250 --> 30:39.750
This doesn't make any sense.
This whole thing is a miracle, right?

30:40.049 --> 30:42.789
You don't just get
half a miracle, do you?

30:44.849 --> 30:48.990
The Powers brought her this far
and protected the baby all this time.

30:49.650 --> 30:51.089
We don't know that.

30:51.450 --> 30:55.309
We don't know that it's the Powers
that have been protecting it.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.269
What if Darla's carrying
the thing in the prophecy?

30:59.849 --> 31:03.819
That scourge of mankind that will
plunge the world into darkness?

31:04.650 --> 31:09.670
What if what's happening to Darla now
is the Powers doing something?

31:10.049 --> 31:12.819
How? By killing my kid?

31:21.450 --> 31:24.119
You always have to be
so damned honest?

31:25.049 --> 31:27.400
What?! Hey, hey, it worked!

31:28.049 --> 31:29.660
I fixed it!

31:31.049 --> 31:33.539
Yay, me?

31:53.250 --> 31:55.279
How you doing?

31:57.450 --> 32:00.329
He finally stopped kicking.

32:01.650 --> 32:02.880
Did he?

32:05.250 --> 32:08.440
I guess he figured
he finally got your attention.

32:11.250 --> 32:12.650
You called him "he."

32:14.250 --> 32:17.089
That's the first time
you've ever done that.

32:19.650 --> 32:20.950
He's dying.

32:23.849 --> 32:25.849
Isn't he?

32:26.849 --> 32:28.359
No.

32:30.450 --> 32:34.170
You lied much better
when you didn't have a soul.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.829
- I can feel the life slipping away.
- Then don't let it.

32:40.049 --> 32:43.210
You have to fight for this. Please.

32:44.849 --> 32:47.269
I don't know how.

32:50.849 --> 32:52.359
My boy.

32:53.849 --> 32:56.380
My darling boy.

32:58.049 --> 33:00.859
I told you I had nothing
to offer this kid.

33:01.049 --> 33:05.190
Some mother. Can't even offer it life.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.980
Maybe I should go in there. Apologize.

33:12.450 --> 33:15.539
Best to just stay here. Wait this out.

33:16.650 --> 33:20.230
I think both Angel and Darla
just need a little time alone.

33:20.849 --> 33:23.200
This isn't gonna end well, is it?

33:23.849 --> 33:26.869
Okay, everybody's drinking.
I'm buying.

33:28.049 --> 33:31.170
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

33:31.650 --> 33:34.069
We're not open.
Come back tomorrow night.

33:34.650 --> 33:38.130
It's the grand reopening.
Here, here's a flyer.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.200
Thanks.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.759
Run!

34:07.049 --> 34:10.099
- What's going on?
- Just run! Run!

34:43.449 --> 34:45.099
- What is it?
- We're under attack.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.599
You have double-protection
sanctorium spells.

34:48.250 --> 34:51.480
It's a thing with the door,
the stairs and the world.

34:52.449 --> 34:56.139
- You can be outside and chuck stuff in.
- I just said that.

34:56.650 --> 34:58.050
- We gotta get out.
- Holtz.

34:58.449 --> 34:59.920
- Back door?
- What?

35:00.250 --> 35:02.500
- Move the bed.
- How is that possible?

35:03.250 --> 35:06.900
I would've mentioned it before,
but it wasn't the right time.

35:07.449 --> 35:10.400
No, it's the perfect time.

35:11.050 --> 35:14.070
- What's behind the bed?
- An old loading dock door.

35:14.650 --> 35:17.210
My God, what we did to him.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.409
I know.

35:20.050 --> 35:23.170
- You got an ax, a hammer or anything?
- Buddha head.

35:23.650 --> 35:25.190
Rhino.

35:28.449 --> 35:30.940
That's why this is happening.

35:31.449 --> 35:36.719
His family, his children....
What that must have been like for him.

35:38.050 --> 35:40.650
- Doesn't seem so funny now, does it?
- Darla.

35:41.650 --> 35:44.280
We could use some vampire
strength here.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.210
Cordy, Fred.

36:22.449 --> 36:25.860
- Go. I can't. It doesn't matter.
- I'm not leaving you.

36:26.650 --> 36:31.179
All right, go get my car.
It's out front. I got you.

36:32.650 --> 36:33.880
Go!

36:38.650 --> 36:42.199
- Fred, go with them.
- It's okay, they'll come back for us.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.670
- You're going to be okay.
- No.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.980
No, I don't think so.
Once he's gone, I won't be okay.

36:51.130 --> 36:53.090
I won't be okay at all.

36:54.530 --> 36:56.389
I don't know what I'll be.

36:59.889 --> 37:04.389
Angel, our baby's gonna die
right here in this alley.

37:11.889 --> 37:15.119
You died in an alley. Remember?

37:17.050 --> 37:18.449
I remember.

37:20.650 --> 37:22.469
I wanna say I'm sorry.

37:23.050 --> 37:26.670
I wanna say it and mean it,
but I can't.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.130
Aren't you gonna tell me it's okay?

37:36.250 --> 37:37.929
No.

37:39.849 --> 37:43.010
No. It's really not, is it?

37:44.650 --> 37:47.769
We did so many
terrible things together.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.949
So much destruction.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.059
So much pain.

37:59.050 --> 38:03.159
We can't make up for any of it,
you know that, don't you?

38:04.449 --> 38:06.099
Yeah.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.639
This child....

38:09.849 --> 38:14.449
Angel, it's the one good thing
we ever did together.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.440
The only good thing.

38:35.650 --> 38:38.420
You make sure to tell him that.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.429
Do it.

40:44.610 --> 40:49.389
Now's your chance. Do it.
Finish it while you still can.

40:50.610 --> 40:53.800
You can't just let him walk away.
Not now!

40:54.210 --> 40:56.530
Not after what you swore to me!

40:57.210 --> 41:00.829
I swore that I would show no mercy.

41:05.010 --> 41:06.690
And I won't.
