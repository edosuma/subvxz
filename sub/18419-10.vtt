WEBVTT

00:22.190 --> 00:24.558
Huh. What happened
to the light switch?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.270
You were supposed
to be there hours ago.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.072
That's fine. I'll just go
straight to the Pentagon

00:38.139 --> 00:39.207
in the morning.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.208
Oh, we're
slowing you down.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.076
Oh, Keller won't mind.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.044
Where's my little baby?

00:44.112 --> 00:47.381
Oh, kicking up a storm.

00:47.448 --> 00:50.050
I'm pretty sure it's a he.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.154
John.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.452
What is that?

01:25.619 --> 01:28.356
I think the Nazis
just hit Washington.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.621
Gruppenführer Keller.
Welcome.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.723
I trust you and your men
are well rested

05:22.790 --> 05:24.425
since the flight to Berlin.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.896
They're eager to crush
this so-called uprising.

05:28.962 --> 05:33.401
Hmm. Perhaps you could
apprise the gruppenführer

05:33.434 --> 05:35.469
of the latest
developments.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.538
The Führer's death
was clearly a trigger.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.039
There have been incidents

05:39.106 --> 05:41.174
in every major city
along the Eastern Seaboard

05:41.241 --> 05:44.678
as well as the Midwest--
specifically Chicago, where--

05:44.745 --> 05:47.715
Our true enemy
are the Japanese,
not these criminals.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.718
It is your decision
where to best utilize me

05:50.784 --> 05:52.085
and my men,
Obergruppenführer,

05:52.152 --> 05:54.087
but acting Chancellor
Heusmann's hope

05:54.154 --> 05:56.023
is that our reinforcements

05:56.089 --> 05:58.559
will help you
end this destruction.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.596
Well, since you
plainly have

06:02.663 --> 06:05.098
the confidence
of Berlin,

06:05.165 --> 06:06.434
Gruppenführer,

06:06.467 --> 06:07.701
perhaps
you could tell me

06:07.768 --> 06:10.638
what additional
steps I should take.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.574
First that you
make an example.

06:13.641 --> 06:16.109
Which city is reporting
the most unrest?

06:17.745 --> 06:18.612
Larry.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.981
Savannah, Georgia, sir.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.484
I suggest we raze it.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.822
I see.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.959
What's the population
of Savannah, Erich?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.361
Roughly 84,000, sir.

06:34.462 --> 06:37.030
84,000.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.770
Well, thank you,
Gruppenführer.

06:42.836 --> 06:46.874
I will certainly take your
suggestions into account.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.943
I will make the necessary
preparations.

07:25.078 --> 07:28.616
Our empire does not
possess such a device.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.519
No. We do not.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.986
And yet...

07:34.387 --> 07:36.524
that test was
clearly conducted

07:36.557 --> 07:38.091
in Empire territory.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.161
Bikini Atoll,

07:41.228 --> 07:42.996
in the Marshall Islands.

07:43.063 --> 07:47.200
Propaganda films cannot
fake such detail.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.637
The film is real,
Kido-tai'i.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.374
With your help,
it is my intention

07:54.441 --> 07:56.243
to show this film
to Ambassador Reiss.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.911
Impossible.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.880
Ambassador Reiss
and the Nazis

07:59.947 --> 08:01.248
have already evacuated
the city.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.584
Impossible is not an option.

11:45.272 --> 11:49.509
I can see the consternation
in your eyes, Josef.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.444
Speak your mind.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.548
All those people.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.984
Yeah. I know.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.452
It would be terrible.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.790
But we have
a responsibility.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.491
Like getting justice
for the Führer.

12:04.557 --> 12:08.996
No, Josef. I mean
the most important
responsibility.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.864
That's
the Master Race

12:10.931 --> 12:15.035
to imagine and build
a better world.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.604
How is going to war
with the Japanese

12:17.670 --> 12:18.939
going to achieve that?

12:19.006 --> 12:20.874
Our alliance with them
was always a lie.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.044
There is only one
Master Race.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.613
Therefore,
the burden falls on us.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.015
What burden?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.317
To end mankind's
constant state of war

12:30.383 --> 12:34.387
so the real work--
progress, perfection--

12:34.454 --> 12:35.655
can finally begin.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.490
By killing
millions of people?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.633
Josef,

12:46.699 --> 12:49.602
this war
will be terrible, yes,

12:49.669 --> 12:52.973
but this will be
the last war.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.375
And when it is over,

12:55.442 --> 12:58.045
we will have a world
united and at peace

12:58.111 --> 13:01.849
for the first time
in human history.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.217
Imagine, Josef.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.988
Imagine what humanity will
then be able to achieve.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.922
Where have you been?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.489
We've been worried sick.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.934
I sent the girls to Mary's.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.535
- Where is he?
- In there.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.975
Thomas.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.944
You both lied to me.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.846
There's something
wrong with me.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.014
I know there is.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.749
I want you to sit down.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.151
Was I really selected

14:44.217 --> 14:45.718
to go on the trip
to South America,

14:45.785 --> 14:46.954
or was that a lie, too?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.655
Please, Thomas,
just--

14:48.721 --> 14:50.290
Please.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.162
Please, just--

14:55.228 --> 14:56.596
just tell me the truth.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.598
You don't need to know
all of the details.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.467
It's okay.
It's okay.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.538
Thomas,

15:05.605 --> 15:08.408
uh...

15:08.475 --> 15:09.876
you know, the truth is

15:09.977 --> 15:12.112
we have been keeping
something from you,

15:12.179 --> 15:14.314
and it's because
we love you.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.583
We-- We didn't want
to scare you,

15:16.649 --> 15:18.151
but I think we--

15:19.886 --> 15:22.322
we both know we were
wrong to do that.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.327
You have a form
of muscular dystrophy.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.062
It's a disease
that affects the muscles.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.999
That's why you've been
having these, uh,

15:31.999 --> 15:34.601
occasional episodes.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.537
Um...

15:37.604 --> 15:39.439
can I be cured?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.744
Well, the symptoms
may get worse,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.079
but it doesn't mean

15:46.146 --> 15:47.847
you're not going to have
a full life, Thomas.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.383
You understand?
It doesn't mean you're
not going to be happy.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.584
Can I be cured?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.157
No.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.062
I've let you down.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.930
I'm a useless eater.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.498
- No.
- What?

16:05.565 --> 16:06.533
No.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.534
No.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.835
No, you haven't.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.770
You haven't.

16:10.837 --> 16:11.938
I'm sorry.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.473
- You haven't.
- I'm so sorry.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.710
Do you have any idea
how proud we are of you?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.047
But I'm defective.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.415
Don't you ever
say that.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.652
No. To us, you--

16:25.718 --> 16:27.754
you are perfect.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.289
The law clearly
states--

16:29.356 --> 16:32.059
You don't have any worry
about the law, okay?

16:32.125 --> 16:34.227
Now listen to me, Thomas.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.231
Everything
that's happening now,

16:38.298 --> 16:40.133
I know it's very scary.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.602
But I promise you
it's going to be okay.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.206
You believe me?

16:46.273 --> 16:48.375
You're going to be okay.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.689
Ohh.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.533
Yes?

17:13.600 --> 17:16.002
Obergruppenführer
Smith?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.104
Who is this?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.105
S.S. Security.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.439
Lincoln-Rockwell Airport.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.541
I'm sorry to bother you
at home, sir,

17:21.608 --> 17:26.279
but we have a Japanese
national in our custody--

17:26.346 --> 17:29.782
Chief Inspector
Takeshi Kido.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.418
I see.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.586
He claims he's here
at your invitation,

17:33.653 --> 17:36.123
but diplomatic visas
have been revoked.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.824
Should I arrest him,
sir?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.528
No. That won't be
necessary.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.031
Send a car.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.333
Yes, sir.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.706
Return his belongings.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.182
Thank you.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.418
The S.S.
are looking for you.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.520
We're moving you
to a safe house.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.756
You told me you were getting
me to the Neutral Zone.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.224
The troops
are moving west,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.160
so it's safer to stay
off the roads.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.627
No, no. I did
everything you asked.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.363
You get me the hell
out of here now.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.232
That's just not an option.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.569
We had a fucking deal,
George.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.937
Oh. Like the one where
you're going to tell us

18:25.004 --> 18:26.473
anything you had
on the Smiths?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.608
Yeah, that one. I did that.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.577
Mm.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.247
What about your little chat
you just had with Thomas?

18:37.217 --> 18:40.253
I warned you.
Your building is wired.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.722
Who do you think
installed the lines?

18:45.225 --> 18:48.795
it's perfect.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.530
You're spying on me.

18:50.597 --> 18:55.101
You should have told us
that Thomas was sick.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.404
You leave him
the hell out of this.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.740
Do you know how many
of our people died

19:00.807 --> 19:02.975
trying to bring down Smith?

19:03.042 --> 19:06.313
This is the silver bullet.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.782
You son of a bitch.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.220
Smith is committing a crime
against the state--

19:13.220 --> 19:15.822
concealing
his son's illness.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.957
We get this out
to our pirate radio people,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.459
we don't have to
assassinate him.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.228
The Nazis will
execute him for us.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.230
The hypocrite
won't last an hour.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.597
Yeah, and then
they'll kill Thomas,

19:24.664 --> 19:27.099
and he's just a fucking
kid, George!

19:27.234 --> 19:29.135
Who grew up to be a Nazi.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.471
He's sick anyway.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.941
You sound just like them.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.277
What's all this now?

19:40.247 --> 19:41.248
I'll tell you later.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.049
I have to get Juliana
out of here.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.917
Then you'd better
get ready.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.555
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.591
What do you mean, wait here?
Where are you going?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.059
There are checkpoints
everywhere.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.427
I've got to do something.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.347
Thanks.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.650
Poor George.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.353
He thinks,
by saving your life,

20:20.420 --> 20:22.154
he's doing right by Trudy.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.590
But you don't.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.466
Go ahead and look.

20:33.533 --> 20:37.504
My family was in D.C.
when the big one dropped.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.513
I didn't know
your sister that well.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.748
She wasn't with us
for long.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.320
But I never doubted
whose side she was on.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.925
I'm pretty much done trying
to convince you people.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.661
We made a deal.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.963
You going to keep it
or not?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.884
A message from a friend
back in San Francisco.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.926
Karen Vecchione.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.687
Damn it!

22:00.753 --> 22:01.854
Uhh--

22:28.147 --> 22:29.081
You stay back.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.417
Hey, p-put the gun down.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.751
It's a disguise.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.486
What the hell
did they do to you?

22:33.553 --> 22:35.287
Did you know?

22:35.422 --> 22:37.790
Look, Juliana,
let me help you, okay?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.426
You fucking--
You all lied!

22:39.492 --> 22:40.593
Now give me the tape!

22:40.660 --> 22:42.128
I'm not going to do that.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.466
Look at you in that uniform.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.300
It suits you.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.769
If you don't want
my fucking help,

22:49.836 --> 22:51.738
fine.
You're on your own.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.707
You give me
that fucking tape,

22:54.774 --> 22:56.142
or you are no better
than the Nazis.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.178
Good! Because if we're
going to beat them,

22:59.245 --> 23:00.613
we need to be worse.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.982
Please!

23:03.049 --> 23:04.617
Please!

23:52.665 --> 23:55.001
I do believe my father
wants what's best.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.939
But this can't be the way.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.944
Well,
is his mind made up?

24:07.046 --> 24:09.749
Which is why
I have to do something.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.519
You did.

24:12.585 --> 24:13.820
You made
your opposition known

24:13.886 --> 24:15.688
to the acting Chancellor
of the Reich.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.023
Those are just words.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.058
You spoke aloud

24:19.125 --> 24:20.693
what others would not
dare think.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.530
And it didn't do anything.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.898
Because it's not
our turn, Joe.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.537
The Reich still belongs
to the old men--

24:30.537 --> 24:31.671
your father and mine,

24:31.738 --> 24:33.305
the Himmlers
and the Goebbels

24:33.372 --> 24:35.207
and all the rest of them.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.544
But they will be
gone soon,

24:37.577 --> 24:39.712
and we need to look
beyond their wars

24:39.779 --> 24:43.015
to what we will
build after.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.618
If there's anything
left, Nicole.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.893
Look.

24:59.365 --> 25:03.035
You said you put your faith
in a person, not a cause.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.008
Well, I put my faith
in you.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.176
Was it one of his?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.781
The Man
In the High Castle?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.985
Aside
from the late Führer,

27:33.052 --> 27:34.453
does anyone else
in the Reich

27:34.520 --> 27:35.888
know about these films

27:35.955 --> 27:37.724
or their true nature?

27:41.227 --> 27:44.263
The Empire did not
assassinate your Führer.

27:44.330 --> 27:48.267
Our nations will go
to war based on a lie.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.606
Why bring it to me?

27:54.741 --> 27:57.543
If there is war,

27:57.609 --> 27:59.611
Heydrich and his
co-conspirators

27:59.746 --> 28:01.881
will be the only victors.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.819
And we will both have
failed in our duty.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.060
Leave it with me.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.841
Where will you go?

28:28.908 --> 28:30.777
I would ask your driver

28:30.777 --> 28:32.979
to deliver me
to the Japanese Embassy.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.983
If I fail...

28:39.518 --> 28:41.320
you may not be safe there.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.324
If you fail...

28:47.126 --> 28:50.396
I prefer to die
on Japanese soil.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.618
Excuse me.

29:15.621 --> 29:16.989
Raeder.

29:17.056 --> 29:20.092
Erich, I need you
to pull up the files

29:20.159 --> 29:23.129
on our friend
in the basement.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.232
Yes, sir. I understand.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.190
What's going on?

29:53.692 --> 29:56.062
I have to go to Berlin.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.263
Now?

29:58.497 --> 29:59.698
No.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.400
It's just
for a couple of days.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.969
Don't you dare.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.804
What did I say?
You don't trust me.

30:05.872 --> 30:09.608
Trust you? Trust is not
going to fix this, John.

30:09.675 --> 30:10.676
Nothing will.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.811
It's in your blood.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.013
Helen--

30:14.080 --> 30:15.281
- Your brother had it.
- Stop it.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.815
- Now my son--
- Stop it.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.750
...has it. My daughters.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.286
Even if they aren't
sick with this,

30:20.352 --> 30:22.554
- they certainly carry it.
- Be quiet.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.825
We're going to get
through this.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.828
Let's just stick
to the plan.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.899
The plan?

30:32.965 --> 30:36.468
The plan where I never
get to see my son again?

30:36.535 --> 30:38.137
That plan?

30:38.204 --> 30:41.407
No, you make another--
you make another plan,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.943
or the girls and I,
we go with Thomas

30:44.010 --> 30:46.412
someplace where your
genetic defect

30:46.478 --> 30:48.214
isn't a threat to us.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.627
I love you.

31:50.709 --> 31:51.978
Sir.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.515
Wait outside the car,
Corporal.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.528
You bring the file?

32:09.595 --> 32:11.197
Yes, sir.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.042
Tape it.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.919
I want you to stand down
the Savannah operation.

32:34.020 --> 32:36.722
I won't burn
one of our own cities.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.325
Yes, sir.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.729
And, Erich.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.266
I'm going to Berlin.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.372
Yes, sir.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.044
Once the gruppenführer
finds out,

32:58.077 --> 32:59.678
he will assume command,

32:59.745 --> 33:01.247
and he will order
your arrest.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.915
I know. And that's
why it's essential

33:04.050 --> 33:06.152
I reach Berlin
before he knows I'm gone.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.054
As far as I know, sir...

33:09.355 --> 33:11.190
you're sequestered
at home.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.163
- If I may ask--
- Don't.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.467
If I succeed...

33:23.335 --> 33:25.171
then you'll understand.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.777
Thank you, Erich.

34:44.450 --> 34:45.417
John.

34:46.885 --> 34:48.254
Hello, Joe.

34:49.621 --> 34:52.158
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

34:52.191 --> 34:53.525
In private?

35:13.179 --> 35:14.680
I need your help, Joe.

35:19.084 --> 35:24.723
I need you to show
this to your father.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.198
Why should I help you?

35:36.668 --> 35:39.671
It's proof that the
Japanese have the bomb.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.008
Bullshit.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.676
You watch it for yourself.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.813
Your father is
about to start a war

35:47.879 --> 35:50.782
based on the assumption
the Japanese won't retaliate,

35:50.849 --> 35:52.318
but they will.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.722
If you don't
help me, Joe,

35:56.788 --> 35:59.225
your home's going to
become a wasteland.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.362
If it's so important,

36:03.429 --> 36:05.831
why don't you take it
to my father yourself?

36:05.897 --> 36:08.334
Because they'd arrest me.

36:08.400 --> 36:12.003
My orders were
to stay in New York.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.240
My presence here
is, uh,

36:14.306 --> 36:16.442
unauthorized.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.782
Why should I trust you?

36:25.251 --> 36:27.453
You lied to me
since the day we met.

36:29.054 --> 36:31.257
You knew I was Lebensborn.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.859
You knew I was
Heusmann's only son.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.764
It's the only reason
that you kept me around--

36:39.731 --> 36:43.602
so that one day
you could cash in.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.773
What can I say?

36:47.839 --> 36:49.275
It's true.

36:51.076 --> 36:52.311
Uh-huh.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.514
At least you admit it.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.852
What's also true

37:00.919 --> 37:03.522
is that, over the years,

37:03.589 --> 37:07.693
I came to regard you
in some ways as a son.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.160
Ah, come on.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.297
You don't have
to believe me.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.466
You have every right
to be angry.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.871
But now you got
to put that aside.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.843
A lot of people
are going to die, Joe.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.880
More than you can
possibly imagine.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.817
People who we love.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.354
Rita, Buddy...

37:37.122 --> 37:38.690
Helen, the kids.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.563
- What makes you think--
- Juliana Crain.

37:48.834 --> 37:49.968
What?

37:53.372 --> 37:55.541
She's been living
in New York, Joe...

37:57.175 --> 37:58.710
under my protection.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.449
No, no.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.384
No, I know that's a lie.

38:05.451 --> 38:08.219
My family sponsored
her citizenship.

38:08.354 --> 38:09.555
You can check it
with one call.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.856
She was in the Resistance.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.524
You would have never
have granted that.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.026
When I saw how
important she was,

38:15.093 --> 38:16.762
I kept her alive.

38:23.101 --> 38:26.037
You manipulative
son of a bitch.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.667
Obergruppenführer Smith,

38:55.734 --> 38:57.536
I have an order
for your arrest.

38:57.603 --> 38:58.804
No, hold on.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.271
The obergruppenführer
is here

39:00.406 --> 39:01.640
with critical
intelligence

39:01.707 --> 39:04.242
that the acting
chancellor needs to hear.

39:04.309 --> 39:05.644
I have my orders.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.912
And I'm countermanding them

39:06.978 --> 39:09.415
on my authority.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.601
Josef, what is this?

39:29.668 --> 39:31.302
Something you must see.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.337
What?

39:32.438 --> 39:33.805
Enemy intelligence.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.775
It'll take ten minutes
of your time,

39:36.842 --> 39:39.511
but it will
change everything.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.856
What you're
seeing, gentlemen,

39:50.922 --> 39:53.324
is a new type
of atomic device

39:53.459 --> 39:55.461
called a hydrogen bomb...

39:57.162 --> 40:00.131
with a magnitude a thousand
times more powerful

40:00.198 --> 40:02.067
than anything in our arsenal.

40:03.935 --> 40:08.106
The site of the test
is the Bikini Atoll

40:08.173 --> 40:09.608
in the Marshall Islands,

40:09.675 --> 40:14.079
deep inside the territory
of the Japanese Empire.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.630
When was this test
conducted?

40:33.364 --> 40:35.433
It's hard to say.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.503
Possibly years ago.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.567
Reichsführer.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.538
There's one more thing
you need to see.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.246
This is backed up by
extensive audio recordings,

41:21.312 --> 41:23.915
but I think you'll find
it gets to the heart
of the matter.

41:30.088 --> 41:35.426
You may be surprised
to hear this, Reichsführer,

41:35.561 --> 41:38.630
but until two days ago,

41:38.697 --> 41:42.000
Obersgruppenführer
Heydrich was alive

41:42.067 --> 41:43.969
and in my custody.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.403
Under interrogation,

41:45.470 --> 41:47.005
he revealed a conspiracy--

41:47.072 --> 41:50.976
a very large,
far-reaching conspiracy.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.779
The Führer
was not assassinated

41:53.845 --> 41:55.781
by Japanese agents, sir.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.585
He was poisoned

41:59.651 --> 42:02.353
by the same conspirator

42:02.420 --> 42:06.625
who was behind the shooting
of the Crown Prince of Japan,

42:06.692 --> 42:10.495
the same conspirator
who, even now,

42:10.596 --> 42:13.599
is plotting to provoke
a war against Japan.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.837
One that will
consolidate his power.

42:21.607 --> 42:23.709
Just think
of the innocent lives.

42:26.411 --> 42:27.846
Come with me.

42:35.754 --> 42:37.756
Father, you can't.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.192
I know the casualties
will be high,

42:41.259 --> 42:42.628
but that may be necessary.

42:42.628 --> 42:43.962
You can't really
believe that.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.530
Did you listen to nothing
that I've said?

42:45.631 --> 42:46.965
Of course I did,

42:47.032 --> 42:48.667
but you can't
build a better world

42:48.734 --> 42:50.301
if there's nothing
left of it.

43:06.484 --> 43:08.119
What the hell's going on?

43:08.186 --> 43:11.222
Your father's
a traitor, Joe.

43:13.725 --> 43:16.962
You son of a bitch!

43:37.482 --> 43:39.017
Well done.

43:41.486 --> 43:42.954
Obergruppenführer,

43:44.589 --> 43:46.057
follow me.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.052
Der Rädensführer...

44:47.118 --> 44:48.353
The Ringleader...

44:49.487 --> 44:50.889
of these traitors...

44:52.357 --> 44:53.759
Martin Heusmann...

44:55.827 --> 44:58.563
attempted to deceive you.

44:58.629 --> 45:00.766
- It's father.
- Shh.

45:32.597 --> 45:34.165
The Reich thanks you.

45:36.501 --> 45:38.203
The Reich salutes you.

45:51.817 --> 45:53.051
- Seig--
- Heil!

45:53.118 --> 45:54.252
- Seig--
- Heil!

45:54.319 --> 45:55.620
- Seig--
- Heil!

45:55.686 --> 45:56.687
- Seig--
- Heil!

45:56.822 --> 45:57.823
- Seig--
- Heil!

45:57.823 --> 45:58.857
- Seig--
- Heil!

45:58.924 --> 45:59.958
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:00.025 --> 46:01.192
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:01.259 --> 46:02.260
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:02.327 --> 46:03.528
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:03.594 --> 46:04.629
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:04.695 --> 46:06.397
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:52.343 --> 46:53.644
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:53.711 --> 46:55.046
- Seig--
- Heil!

46:55.113 --> 46:56.514
- Seig--
- Heil!

47:06.892 --> 47:09.060
This is where you get out.

47:09.127 --> 47:10.428
Sorry?

47:10.495 --> 47:12.430
It's as far as you go.

47:15.934 --> 47:17.502
All right. Thank you.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.687
...and the Reich forces

47:36.754 --> 47:38.189
would immediately stand down.

47:38.256 --> 47:40.391
At the 11th hour,
war was averted

47:40.458 --> 47:42.727
by the shock revelation
that Chancellor Heusmann

47:42.793 --> 47:46.031
had fabricated evidence
against the Japanese.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.698
The brave sons of the Reich

47:47.765 --> 47:50.001
who had been deployed
to the front lines,

47:50.068 --> 47:51.469
were stunned to learn

47:51.536 --> 47:53.104
that Chancellor
Heusmann's betrayal

47:53.171 --> 47:55.040
was exposed by one
of our own leaders--

47:55.106 --> 47:56.841
the GNR's
head of intelligence,

47:56.942 --> 47:58.776
Obergruppenführer Smith.

47:58.843 --> 48:00.278
In a historic moment,

48:00.345 --> 48:01.712
viewed by tens of millions,

48:01.779 --> 48:03.014
Obergruppenführer

48:03.081 --> 48:04.582
became the first American

48:04.649 --> 48:06.651
to receive the Iron Guard
salute in Berlin.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.086
Oh, sure. Dad's on TV,

48:08.153 --> 48:09.955
and now you're gonna
act all grown up?

48:10.021 --> 48:11.522
Reichsführer Himmler

48:11.589 --> 48:14.225
welcomes a new era
of peace between a world...

48:16.561 --> 48:18.496
I love you, Jennifer.

48:18.563 --> 48:19.630
Later in this program,

48:19.697 --> 48:21.132
we will bring you
information...

48:23.868 --> 48:25.136
- Mom.
- Hmm?

48:25.203 --> 48:27.438
There's something
wrong with Thomas.

49:23.194 --> 49:25.030
What is this?

49:27.365 --> 49:30.668
May I have a moment, please?

49:30.735 --> 49:32.070
Thomas.

49:34.939 --> 49:36.041
Look, I won't tell them

49:36.107 --> 49:38.509
about what you
and Father said.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.611
Be proud of me.

49:40.678 --> 49:43.248
Tell Father to be proud.

49:43.314 --> 49:44.682
No. Thom-- Thomas.

49:46.284 --> 49:48.619
Thomas, stay with me!

49:48.686 --> 49:50.288
Stay with me, Thomas!

49:50.355 --> 49:51.156
Thomas!

50:04.735 --> 50:06.071
Thomas!

50:06.137 --> 50:09.707
Thomas, don't go!

50:11.442 --> 50:12.743
Thomas!

50:13.878 --> 50:15.613
Thomas!

50:25.590 --> 50:27.225
Thomas!

51:05.963 --> 51:07.565
Hello, Juliana.

51:13.538 --> 51:14.705
You knew.

51:16.006 --> 51:17.275
You knew
what would happen.

51:17.342 --> 51:19.144
You showed me that film,
and you knew.

51:19.177 --> 51:22.046
You knew I'd come here
and I'd killed him.

51:22.147 --> 51:24.149
You think I wanted
to hurt you?

51:24.182 --> 51:26.951
No. No!

51:27.017 --> 51:29.220
No, the only thing I knew

51:29.287 --> 51:31.389
was that you,
Juliana Crain,

51:31.456 --> 51:34.425
were the only hope
any of us had.

51:34.492 --> 51:37.528
You asked me if you
were in the films.

51:38.696 --> 51:40.665
You are, you were,

51:40.731 --> 51:42.900
over and over again.

51:42.967 --> 51:44.969
Sometimes...

51:45.035 --> 51:47.172
I'd see you in the
background somewhere--

51:47.205 --> 51:51.809
a protest, a speech,
a war zone, maybe.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.544
Some place that mattered.

51:55.580 --> 51:57.648
I started knowing
where to look.

51:58.649 --> 52:00.451
You could never
stay out of it.

52:02.052 --> 52:04.922
Some of the people
you knew--

52:04.989 --> 52:06.991
I started
seeing them, too,

52:07.057 --> 52:10.961
revolving around you

52:11.028 --> 52:13.198
like an atom. But...

52:14.199 --> 52:15.366
they would change--

52:15.433 --> 52:18.203
different behavior,
different relationships,

52:18.203 --> 52:19.937
different points of view

52:20.004 --> 52:22.006
shaped by their lives.

52:22.072 --> 52:25.410
But you were always you.

52:26.444 --> 52:30.548
You and your unnatural
consistent mind.

52:32.217 --> 52:34.519
What if you haven't
seen this film?

52:34.585 --> 52:37.087
Well, I got to know a woman

52:37.222 --> 52:39.890
who would bet
on the best in us,

52:39.957 --> 52:41.492
who bet on people,

52:41.559 --> 52:44.395
no matter what the world
said about who they were,

52:44.462 --> 52:47.232
who they should be.

52:47.298 --> 52:48.999
That woman would do anything

52:49.066 --> 52:52.770
to save a sick boy--
a Nazi boy, even--

52:52.837 --> 52:55.773
because she would believe
he deserved the chance,

52:55.840 --> 52:59.744
as slim as it might be,
to live a valuable life.

53:03.381 --> 53:07.485
And I knew that was the key,

53:07.552 --> 53:10.288
the only way to make sure

53:10.355 --> 53:11.956
that your sister's father

53:12.022 --> 53:13.858
wouldn't prevent
that boy's father

53:13.924 --> 53:15.626
from stopping a war.

53:18.963 --> 53:22.567
Dixon died in an alley

53:22.633 --> 53:26.304
so that son of a bitch
Smith could live up.

53:27.672 --> 53:30.941
San Francisco
is still here.

53:31.008 --> 53:33.177
Millions of people
will live

53:33.278 --> 53:35.580
because of the choice
you made,

53:35.646 --> 53:38.983
the goodness in you,
Juliana.

53:40.385 --> 53:43.954
One selfless act
of love and hope.

53:44.021 --> 53:45.890
That's what I put
my money on.

53:45.956 --> 53:48.393
I have no one left
and nothing left!

53:48.459 --> 53:50.328
There's no way out!

53:52.096 --> 53:53.564
You're wrong.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.735
You're wrong.

54:04.309 --> 54:05.710
Trust me.

54:08.212 --> 54:09.647
Come with me.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.642
Hey, sis.

55:21.452 --> 55:22.787
Kono.

55:27.257 --> 55:28.626
Kono.

55:59.424 --> 56:01.091
Mr. Tagomi?

56:03.027 --> 56:05.095
I'm a friend
of Juliana Crain.

56:07.097 --> 56:08.699
Can I have a word with you?
