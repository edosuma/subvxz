12:07.467 --> 12:11.667
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.500
OH...

12:13.533 --> 12:14.833
UM...

12:14.867 --> 12:15.933
HAVE YOU PACKED?

12:15.967 --> 12:17.067
NO.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.367
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU START

12:18.400 --> 12:19.333
OR SOMETHING?

12:19.367 --> 12:20.667
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.267
I'VE JUST BEEN SO
ENGROSSED IN THIS PROJECT,

12:24.300 --> 12:25.633
AND I'M REALLY
INTO IT, SO...

12:25.667 --> 12:27.067
[SNIFFLES]

12:27.067 --> 12:28.433
I'VE DECIDED I'M NOT
COMING ON THE TRIP.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.367
I WANT YOU TO GO AWAY
WITH SHANE.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.067
WHAT?

12:32.067 --> 12:33.267
YEP.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.500
WITH SHANE? WHY--

12:34.533 --> 12:36.133
YEAH, BECAUSE I THINK

12:36.167 --> 12:38.133
YOU GUYS WILL HAVE A BLAST
TOGETHER.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.633
JENNY,
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.233
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO
PULL OUT OF THIS.

12:42.267 --> 12:43.233
YOU KNOW--

12:43.267 --> 12:44.300
NO EXCUSES. NO.
YOU'RE COMING.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.067
THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.333
WHEN BURR CONNOR FIRED ME,
HE JUST...

12:47.367 --> 12:48.633
THE BEST THING
THAT CAME OUT OF THAT EXPERIENCE

12:48.667 --> 12:50.067
WAS HE WAS, LIKE,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.667
"YOU'VE GOT TO TELL THE TRUTH
ABOUT YOUR LIFE,

12:51.700 --> 12:53.700
AND YOU HAVE TO BE TRUTHFUL
ABOUT YOUR WORK,"

12:53.733 --> 12:54.933
AND THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO,

12:54.967 --> 12:56.367
IS JUST TELL THE FUCKING TRUTH,
AND--

12:56.400 --> 12:57.967
ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
FINE, FINE, FINE.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.567
WELL, HERE'S A TRUTH.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.933
I WOULD LIKE TO GO
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

13:00.967 --> 13:03.067
SO, YOU KNOW--

13:03.067 --> 13:04.567
WHO'S THAT?

13:06.133 --> 13:08.467
IT'S YOU.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.900
PLEASE JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.067
YES, DO YOU THINK

13:14.100 --> 13:16.067
WE COULD PULL
THESE STRAPS UP

13:16.100 --> 13:17.167
A LITTLE?

13:17.200 --> 13:19.600
BECAUSE THIS...

13:19.633 --> 13:21.833
IS WHAT I WANT
TO SEE.

13:21.867 --> 13:23.567
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.267
GOOD.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.633
WE'LL TAKE IT.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.267
CAN YOU EXCUSE US FOR A MINUTE,
PLEASE?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.400
OF COURSE.

13:30.433 --> 13:31.300
THANKS.

13:32.833 --> 13:34.600
THIS IS A $5,000 DRESS.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.400
THEY'RE GIVING ME
AN AWARD

13:36.433 --> 13:38.067
FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.467
I DON'T WANT TO SHOW UP
IN SOME SORT OF...

13:39.500 --> 13:42.367
EXTRAVAGANT,
OVER-THE-TOP GOWN.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.467
THAT MONEY CAN BE USED
IN SO MANY OTHER WAYS.

13:48.833 --> 13:52.233
TINA, PLEASE,
DON'T TELL ME

13:52.267 --> 13:55.267
WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT
SPEND MY OWN MONEY ON.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.867
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY

13:57.900 --> 14:00.700
I PERSONALLY GIVE AWAY
EVERY YEAR?

14:00.733 --> 14:02.600
HOW MANY CHARITIES

14:02.633 --> 14:05.300
THE PEABODY FOUNDATION
SPONSORS?

14:05.333 --> 14:07.067
I MEAN...

14:07.067 --> 14:09.900
IT WOULD GIVE ME
THE UTMOST PLEASURE

14:09.933 --> 14:12.133
TO BUY YOU THIS DRESS,

14:12.167 --> 14:14.733
SO, PLEASE...

14:14.767 --> 14:17.833
BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH
TO LET ME.

14:24.133 --> 14:25.833
WE'LL TAKE IT.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.433
DID I MENTION
I INVITED BETTE?

14:31.867 --> 14:33.500
WHAT?

14:33.533 --> 14:36.067
HEY, SHANE,
COME HERE.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.333
HEY.

14:39.367 --> 14:40.467
OKAY, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.733
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE,

14:41.767 --> 14:42.733
SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.133
WHAT?

14:44.167 --> 14:45.633
NOT GOING.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.867
YOU'RE GOING ON THAT CRUISE.

14:46.900 --> 14:47.867
I'M NOT GOING.

14:47.900 --> 14:48.867
YES, YOU ARE.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.067
NO, I'M NOT.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.400
I DON'T WANT TO.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.633
YOU KNOW WHY?

14:52.667 --> 14:53.833
I'M ACTUALLY WORKING
ON SOMETHING

14:53.867 --> 14:55.167
THAT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME,

14:55.200 --> 14:56.500
AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO
FUCK AROUND ANYMORE,

14:56.533 --> 14:57.833
AND I WANT TO BE SERIOUS

14:57.867 --> 14:59.200
ABOUT MY WORK.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.933
FUCK IT.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.767
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING,
I'M NOT GOING.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.867
WHAT?

15:03.900 --> 15:05.067
WAIT A MINUTE!

15:05.067 --> 15:06.100
NO, COME BACK HERE.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.733
IF YOU DON'T GO
AND IF YOU DON'T GO,

15:07.767 --> 15:08.900
THEN I'M NOT
GOING TO GO,

15:08.933 --> 15:10.333
AND I WANTED TO GO,

15:10.367 --> 15:11.633
AND I GUESS
DANA AND ALICE

15:11.667 --> 15:12.967
ARE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO BE PISSED,

15:13.067 --> 15:14.067
BECAUSE NO ONE'S
GOING TO GO.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.133
OH, MY GOD!

15:15.167 --> 15:16.133
I'M NOT GOING TO GO!

15:16.167 --> 15:18.933
I'M GOING TO GO.
I'M GOING TO GO.

15:18.967 --> 15:20.567
I'M GOING TO GO.
WE'RE GOING TO--

15:20.600 --> 15:24.367
WE'RE GOING TO BE
A FUCKING THREESOME, MAN.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.133
ALL RIGHT,

15:28.167 --> 15:29.300
BUT WE'RE BOTH
STILL TAKING GINGER,

15:29.333 --> 15:31.067
NO MATTER WHAT, ALL RIGHT?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.500
OH, AND JUST IN CASE,

15:32.533 --> 15:34.500
I'VE GOT THESE TWO THINGS
FOR SEASICKNESS.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.067
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET SEASICK.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.233
THERE'S NO REASON FOR BOTH OF US

15:37.267 --> 15:40.067
TO TAKE THINGS LIKE TOOTHPASTE,
OR...

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
RAZORS,

15:42.133 --> 15:44.833
OR Q-TIPS, OR HAND SANITIZER.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.200
AL?

15:46.233 --> 15:47.267
HMM?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.067
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:51.067 --> 15:52.267
NOTHING.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.167
YES, THERE IS.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.233
OKAY,

15:56.267 --> 15:57.600
LET'S JUST WORK THIS OUT

15:57.633 --> 15:59.100
BEFORE WE GET ON THE GIANT BOAT
THAT SINKS WITH YOU MAD AT ME.

16:00.867 --> 16:02.600
ALICE...

16:04.500 --> 16:06.800
LOOK, I AM A WRECK
ABOUT THIS CRUISE,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.533
AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

16:08.567 --> 16:11.100
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL, DANA,
IF I CAME DOWN

16:11.133 --> 16:14.067
AND I JUST INTERRUPTED
ONE OF YOUR MATCHES, OR...

16:15.833 --> 16:18.267
CORRECTED ONE OF YOUR SHOTS?

16:20.467 --> 16:21.467
OKAY.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.633
IS THIS ABOUT ME
TALKING ON YOUR SHOW?

16:22.667 --> 16:23.633
YOU WEREN'T TALKING.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.800
YOU WERE INTERRUPTING ME,

16:24.833 --> 16:26.700
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
RESPECT THE FACT

16:26.733 --> 16:28.300
THAT IT WAS MY GIG,

16:28.333 --> 16:30.667
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.067
I'M REALLY SORRY.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.467
I'M SUCH AN ASS.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.733
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.200
SORRY, I JUST HATE
THESE CRUISES.

17:01.233 --> 17:04.267
I JUST GET REALLY SEASICK
AND SCARED, YOU KNOW?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.500
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
THAT SCARED.

17:07.533 --> 17:08.667
I'M GOING TO BE THERE

17:08.700 --> 17:09.967
TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU, BABY.

17:10.067 --> 17:12.467
MM.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.867
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY--

17:13.900 --> 17:16.767
NO ONE EVER GOT SICK
ON THE LOVE BOAT.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.100
ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.833
COREY PARKER,
WHO PLAYED THE SHIP'S DOCTOR,

17:20.867 --> 17:21.933
HE WAS HORRIBLY SEASICK.

17:21.967 --> 17:23.233
NO, NO, NO.

17:23.267 --> 17:24.667
THE SHIP'S DOCTOR
WAS BERNIE KOPELL.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.167
DR. ADAM BRICKER.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.400
RIGHT, AND THEN
COREY PARKER

17:27.433 --> 17:31.067
PLAYED DR. JOHN MORGAN,
HIS REPLACEMENT.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.367
IT WAS THE SEQUEL,

17:32.400 --> 17:33.467
LOVE BOAT:
THE NEXT WAVE.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.967
WELL, YEAH,
BUT THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

17:35.067 --> 17:38.267
I MEAN, IF IT DOESN'T HAVE
GOPHER AND ISAAC WASHINGTON

17:38.300 --> 17:40.133
AND, YOU KNOW,
CAPTAIN MERRILL STUBING,

17:40.167 --> 17:41.533
THAT'S NOT THE LOVE BOAT.

17:41.567 --> 17:42.700
AND DON'T FORGET JULIE.

17:42.733 --> 17:44.633
HELLO.

17:44.667 --> 17:45.967
REALLY?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.733
[CLEARS THROAT]

17:48.767 --> 17:49.667
HEY.

17:49.700 --> 17:50.767
HEY.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.533
YOU SCARED ME.

17:52.567 --> 17:54.867
HOW'S THE PACKING
COMING ALONG?

17:58.233 --> 18:00.400
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

18:00.433 --> 18:02.433
YOU'RE LIABLE
TO HEAR SHIT ABOUT ME

18:02.467 --> 18:03.867
WHILE YOU'RE GONE,

18:03.900 --> 18:05.967
AND SINCE I WON'T BE THERE
TO DEFEND MYSELF,

18:06.067 --> 18:08.367
I JUST...

18:08.400 --> 18:10.700
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I'M A TOTAL ASSHOLE.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.633
WHAT DID YOU DO?

18:13.667 --> 18:15.067
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

18:15.067 --> 18:16.267
I'M SORRY.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.367
I PROMISE YOU

18:17.400 --> 18:19.100
YOU'LL FIND OUT EVENTUALLY,
THOUGH.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.067
YOU'RE BEING REALLY INTENSE
AND CRYPTIC RIGHT NOW.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.433
YEAH, WELL,

18:27.467 --> 18:29.867
THAT'S MY STYLE,
REALLY INTENSE AND CRYPTIC.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.867
THAT'S HOW I GET
ALL THE LADIES.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.100
YEAH.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.267
SHANE...

18:42.567 --> 18:45.433
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

18:45.467 --> 18:48.067
THAT I'M YOUR FRIEND.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.100
I'M YOUR FRIEND TOO.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.633
DO YOU THINK

18:56.667 --> 18:58.167
THAT CAPTAIN STUBING
GOT MORE WOMEN,

18:58.200 --> 18:59.433
OR THE DOCTOR?

18:59.467 --> 19:01.333
NO, THE DOCTOR DID NOT
GET MORE WOMEN--

19:01.367 --> 19:02.533
HE GETS SO MANY.

19:02.567 --> 19:03.800
NO, NO, NO.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.067
CAPTAIN STUBING
AND JULIE

19:05.067 --> 19:07.200
WERE NOT HAVING
AN AFFAIR, OKAY?

19:07.233 --> 19:08.567
DID YOU EVER
WATCH THE SHOW?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.067
CAPTAIN STUBING
WAS MARRIED.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.933
RIGHT, BUT SUPPOSEDLY
SOMEBODY WAS A BIG HOMO.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.233
WHAT?

19:14.267 --> 19:15.933
WHO CARES?

19:15.967 --> 19:17.333
AND WHY DO WE SAY IT
LIKE BEING A HOMO

19:17.367 --> 19:19.333
IS, LIKE,
SOME DIRTY SECRET?

19:19.367 --> 19:21.067
THANK YOU. EXACTLY.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.767
THANK YOU.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.967
YOU GUYS,
THIS IS FANTASTIC

19:24.067 --> 19:24.967
WE'RE ALL
CARRYING ON.

19:25.067 --> 19:25.967
THIS IS GREAT.

19:26.067 --> 19:26.933
WHAT? NO, NO.

19:26.967 --> 19:28.667
NO, I'M CHECKING.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.333
I'M CHECKING.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.300
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE BEING LIKE THIS.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.300
YOUR BAG
WILL TOTALLY FIT

19:40.333 --> 19:41.300
IN THE OVERHEAD
COMPARTMENT.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.367
NO, IT'S TOO HEAVY.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.367
NO, IT'S NOT.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.367
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE IT?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.400
BECAUSE I'LL SWITCH
WITH YOU.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.967
NO, I DON'T. JUST...

19:48.067 --> 19:48.967
LOOK, I JUST DON'T
WANT TO PUT IT

19:49.067 --> 19:49.967
THROUGH SECURITY, OKAY?

19:50.067 --> 19:50.967
WHY?

19:51.067 --> 19:52.100
I JUST DON'T.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.100
OKAY, FINE.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.133
YOU'RE GOING TO
HOLD EVERYONE ELSE UP,

19:54.167 --> 19:56.167
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE
IS CHECKING ANYTHING.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.833
AL! AL!

19:58.867 --> 20:00.700
GODDAMMIT.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.833
ALICE...

20:12.500 --> 20:14.000
DADDY!

20:20.000 --> 20:21.267
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.933
HOW ARE YOU?

20:24.967 --> 20:26.133
I'M VERY WELL,
AND YOU?

20:26.167 --> 20:27.267
I'M GOOD.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.600
I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.100
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO THE OFFICE,

20:30.133 --> 20:32.600
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO
SEE AN AMAZING PAINTING

20:32.633 --> 20:35.233
THAT I HAVE ON LOAN
FROM THE GETTY,

20:35.267 --> 20:36.300
AND THEN WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE LUNCH

20:36.333 --> 20:38.900
WITH AN INCREDIBLE
ARTIST.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.667
YOU REMEMBER
ALLYN BARNES?

20:40.700 --> 20:42.800
IS HE THE PAINTER?

20:42.833 --> 20:44.800
NO, IT'S NOT
HER PAINTING.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.267
THE PAINTING
IS 14th CENTURY,

20:46.300 --> 20:47.867
BY DOSSO DOSSI.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.567
NO, ALLYN BARNES WAS
MY TEACHER AT YALE.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.700
SHE'S PROBABLY ONE OF
OUR MOST IMPORTANT

20:52.733 --> 20:53.933
LIVING ARTISTS.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.600
NEVER HEARD OF HER.

21:08.633 --> 21:10.900
SHE'S THE REASON
I WANTED TO GO INTO THE ARTS.

21:10.933 --> 21:13.067
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOUR MOTHER'S INFLUENCE.

21:15.767 --> 21:19.300
SHE WAS A GREAT ARTIST.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.833
YOU REMEMBER HER WATERCOLORS,
DON'T YOU?

21:21.867 --> 21:23.567
OF COURSE I DO,
DADDY.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.767
I HAVE ALL OF THEM.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.733
[***]

21:36.333 --> 21:38.933
PLEASE GO THROUGH.
PLEASE GO THROUGH.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.367
STEP HERE, PLEASE,
MA'AM.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.133
COME ON.

21:44.167 --> 21:44.867
[BEEPING]

21:44.900 --> 21:46.133
HOLD IT THERE.

21:46.167 --> 21:47.733
OKAY, GO OVER
TO THE SIDE, PLEASE,

21:47.767 --> 21:48.467
IF YOU WOULD.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.767
THANK YOU.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.767
DANA, NOBODY CARES
ABOUT MEDICATION.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.067
THANK YOU.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.800
ALL RIGHT,
GO AHEAD.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.300
PUT YOUR ARMS UP.
THANK YOU.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.600
COME BACK!

22:00.233 --> 22:01.733
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.133
FAYE...

22:03.167 --> 22:06.067
COME HERE.

22:07.433 --> 22:08.700
THANKS.

22:08.733 --> 22:11.233
I THINK WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING HERE.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.567
WHAT IS IT,
SOME KIND OF A WEAPON?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.800
LADIES?

22:19.833 --> 22:21.767
STEP OVER HERE,
PLEASE.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.767
WHAT THE HELL?

22:38.667 --> 22:40.167
YOU JUST...

22:40.200 --> 22:42.067
IT, UM... OKAY?

22:44.233 --> 22:45.067
GREAT.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.567
YEAH. NIPPLE CLAMPS.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.967
[WHISPERING]:
WHEN DID YOU GET THOSE?

22:57.067 --> 22:59.100
BABY...

22:59.133 --> 23:01.200
YOU CAN'T TAKE THESE
ON THE PLANE, LADIES.

23:01.233 --> 23:03.733
YOU SHOULD KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

23:06.467 --> 23:07.867
OKAY, MA'AM,
YOU CAN GO AHEAD

23:07.900 --> 23:09.067
AND PACK THIS
BACK UP.

23:09.067 --> 23:10.833
GREAT.

23:15.433 --> 23:16.700
HAVE FUN.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.200
YEAH, GOOD, THANKS.

23:18.233 --> 23:19.467
MELVIN,

23:19.500 --> 23:21.233
YOU SEEM TO BE MISSING
THE POINT OF THE PAINTING.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.200
IT'S ABOUT THE FLEETINGNESS
OF FORTUNE.

23:23.233 --> 23:25.467
I JUST SEE IT
DIFFERENTLY.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.600
YOU DON'T THINK

23:26.633 --> 23:27.667
THAT THE MAN
IN THE PAINTING

23:27.700 --> 23:29.367
IS ENJOYING HIS LIFE?

23:29.400 --> 23:31.067
I DON'T.
OF COURSE I DON'T.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.467
HE LOOKS MISERABLE.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.133
SPIRITUALLY VOID.

23:36.167 --> 23:39.267
THE ONLY
TRUE ABUNDANCE

23:39.300 --> 23:41.200
IS HARMONY WITH GOD.

23:41.233 --> 23:43.633
AH, SO FAITH
ASSURES PROSPERITY,

23:43.667 --> 23:45.067
IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

23:45.100 --> 23:47.133
FIGURATIVELY
SPEAKING, YES.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.433
THERE IT IS.

23:48.467 --> 23:49.600
THE DANGLING CARROT

23:49.633 --> 23:51.900
OF THE ASHCROFT
AND THE BUSHIES.

23:51.933 --> 23:53.400
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.833
I HAVE NOTHING
IN COMMON

23:54.867 --> 23:58.067
WITH THE ASHCROFTS
OR THE BUSHIES.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.267
IT'S MERCENARY
CHRISTIANITY,

23:59.300 --> 24:01.433
KEEPING US MORTALS
IN THRALL

24:01.467 --> 24:03.133
THROUGH A COMBINATION
OF FEAR AND PAYOLA.

24:03.167 --> 24:04.767
IT MAKES ME WANT TO GO
BACK INTO A CAVE

24:04.800 --> 24:06.233
AND NEVER
COME OUT AGAIN.

24:06.267 --> 24:08.667
THAT WOULD BE
YOUR PREROGATIVE, MADAME.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.567
DADDY?

24:26.933 --> 24:28.567
DADDY?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.300
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

24:30.333 --> 24:31.367
OH, I...

24:31.400 --> 24:33.600
HERE, COME ON.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.533
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:36.567 --> 24:37.800
YEAH.

24:37.833 --> 24:40.067
RIGHT HERE.

24:59.067 --> 25:01.367
ACTUALLY, I...

25:01.400 --> 25:04.600
I LIKED THE PAINTING
VERY MUCH.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.267
OH, GOOD. I'M GLAD.

25:06.300 --> 25:09.900
SHE JUST WANTED TO MAKE ME
FEEL IGNORANT.

25:11.533 --> 25:13.500
YOUR MOTHER AND I...

25:13.533 --> 25:17.533
WE HAD SOME HEAVY ARGUMENTS--

25:17.567 --> 25:21.200
SMARTEST WOMAN
I EVER MET--

25:21.233 --> 25:23.933
BUT SHE WAS NEVER
CONDESCENDING.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.733
DADDY...

25:28.767 --> 25:31.233
IF YOU LOVED HER
SO MUCH,

25:31.267 --> 25:32.667
THEN WHY DID YOU
LET HER LEAVE?

25:32.700 --> 25:37.767
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY
TO SALVAGE THE MARRIAGE?

25:39.633 --> 25:41.367
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.367
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.100
YOU WOULD'VE HAD TO HAVE
EXPERIENCED

25:47.133 --> 25:50.367
THAT BOND OF MARRIAGE

25:50.400 --> 25:52.367
TO APPRECIATE

25:52.400 --> 25:55.067
HOW MUCH I HURT
YOUR MOTHER.

25:57.067 --> 26:00.367
I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND THAT, DADDY.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.500
I MADE A RESERVATION
FOR US

26:11.533 --> 26:12.700
AT 8:00

26:12.733 --> 26:15.067
AT A RESTAURANT
CALLED ANGELINA OSTERIA.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.067
THEY HAVE REALLY GREAT--

26:16.067 --> 26:16.967
I'D PREFER TO EAT

26:17.067 --> 26:18.200
AT THE HOTEL RESTAURANT TONIGHT.

26:18.233 --> 26:19.533
THAT IS, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

26:19.567 --> 26:22.333
OKAY. WHATEVER YOU WANT.

26:22.367 --> 26:23.933
AND HOW ABOUT SEEING

26:23.967 --> 26:25.767
IF KATIE COULD JOIN US?

26:28.133 --> 26:30.300
YOU WANT KIT
TO COME TO DINNER WITH US?

26:30.333 --> 26:31.400
YEAH.

26:31.433 --> 26:33.667
I'D LIKE TO SEE HER.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.433
WELL, HER BOYFRIEND'S IN TOWN.

26:36.467 --> 26:38.667
HE'S ONLY HERE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, SO...

26:38.700 --> 26:41.733
WELL, SHE SHOULD BRING HIM TOO.

26:43.533 --> 26:45.333
I'LL CALL HER.

26:48.867 --> 26:51.833
YOU KNOW, DADDY,
I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT

26:51.867 --> 26:53.500
THAT YOU JUST INVITED
KIT'S BOYFRIEND

26:53.533 --> 26:54.833
TO COME TO DINNER WITH US,

26:54.867 --> 26:56.367
AND SHE'S ONLY BEEN SEEING HIM
A SHORT WHILE,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.633
BUT YOU HAVE NOT YET
SAID A WORD ABOUT TINA.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.167
WELL, OF COURSE
YOU'RE WELCOME

27:00.200 --> 27:03.133
TO BRING HER TOO,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WISH.

27:03.167 --> 27:05.267
WE'VE SPLIT UP.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.133
OH. WELL, THEN...

27:07.167 --> 27:10.767
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY.

27:12.133 --> 27:13.500
NOTHING.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.467
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
ANYTHING.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.767
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?
WE'RE ACTUALLY ON A CRUISE.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.267
IT'S GOING TO BE FUN.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.633
I'VE GOT MY LITTLE--

27:31.667 --> 27:33.267
IT'S PHOEBE SPARKLE.

27:35.467 --> 27:36.800
WAIT, I WANT TO WATCH

27:36.833 --> 27:38.367
AND SEE IF SHE
MAKES THAT GIRL COME.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.833
CAN SHE DO THAT?

27:39.867 --> 27:41.200
I'M KIDDING, DANA.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.267
OH, MY GOD.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.733
LADIES, WELCOME TO OWLs.

27:57.767 --> 27:59.267
IT STANDS
FOR "OLDER, WISER LESBIANS."

27:59.300 --> 28:01.700
WE TALK ABOUT HOW SPIRITUALITY
AND SEXUALITY

28:01.733 --> 28:03.367
ARE COMBINED,

28:03.400 --> 28:04.767
AND OUR DEFINITION
OF "ORGASM"

28:04.800 --> 28:06.567
IS THAT IT IS
THE KISS OF GOD

28:06.600 --> 28:08.667
THAT BRINGS ECSTASY
TO CONSCIOUSNESS...

28:14.100 --> 28:15.500
DANA!

28:28.433 --> 28:29.533
I'M ALICE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

28:29.567 --> 28:31.067

28:40.167 --> 28:42.867
EXCELLENT.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.933
OH. GOD.

28:47.167 --> 28:48.300
I THOUGHT

28:48.333 --> 28:49.867
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A SUITE.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.533
WELL, I HAVE AN IDEA.

28:51.567 --> 28:53.800
WHY DON'T WE
ALL SLEEP TOGETHER,

28:53.833 --> 28:55.267
AND CARMEN,

28:55.300 --> 28:57.067
YOU CAN SLEEP
IN THE MIDDLE?

28:59.233 --> 29:01.467
I'M GOING TO GO
EXPLORE.

SHE'S ACTING WEIRD.

IN THE BACK.

MISS SPARKLE,

29:35.833 --> 29:37.100
DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE

29:37.133 --> 29:38.433
TO BE A COMMITTED

AND STILL CARRY ON

29:43.300 --> 29:45.267
IT'S CERTAINLY
POSSIBLE.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.867
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

29:46.900 --> 29:49.633
IS TO KNOW THAT JEALOUSY
WILL REAR ITS HEAD.

29:49.667 --> 29:50.833
YOU HAVE TO AGREE

29:50.867 --> 29:51.800
WITH YOUR PRIMARY
LOVED ONE

29:51.833 --> 29:54.167
TO BE HONEST
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS,

30:27.033 --> 30:28.967

THAT ALSO WORKS,

30:29.000 --> 30:30.033
BUT I'M GUESSING

30:30.067 --> 30:31.333
THAT DANA

WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE

30:42.367 --> 30:43.967

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

30:49.733 --> 30:52.300
WELL, I THINK
THEY'RE GREAT.

30:52.333 --> 30:55.533
I'M A BIG, BIG FAN
OF GROUP SEX.

30:55.567 --> 30:56.733
THE ONLY THING

30:56.767 --> 30:58.433
IS THAT ALL PARTIES
HAVE TO BE SIGNED ON

30:58.467 --> 31:00.333
FOR THE SAME AGENDA.

31:00.367 --> 31:01.900
SO THAT'S THE END
OF OUR PANEL FOR TODAY.

31:01.933 --> 31:03.400
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING HERE.

31:03.433 --> 31:05.067
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

31:09.533 --> 31:11.633
YOU SHOULD REALLY SEE
DISNEY HALL, DADDY.

31:11.667 --> 31:15.333
OKAY, BUT NOT TOO EARLY.

31:15.367 --> 31:16.333
SINCE WHEN

31:16.367 --> 31:19.200
DID YOU BECOME A SLEEPYHEAD?

31:19.233 --> 31:21.067
I DO HAVE TO GET BACK BY 5:00
TO GET DRESSED.

31:21.067 --> 31:23.500
TINA'S BEING HONORED.

31:27.433 --> 31:28.667
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW

31:28.700 --> 31:30.233
WHY TINA'S
BEING HONORED?

31:30.267 --> 31:35.067
YES, CERTAINLY,
IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME.

A UNIFIED FIELD THEORY.

46:12.633 --> 46:14.400
SO LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

46:15.700 --> 46:20.200
[APPLAUSE]

46:20.233 --> 46:21.867
THANK YOU.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.800
THANK YOU.

46:28.833 --> 46:30.067
CAPTAIN STUBING,

46:30.067 --> 46:31.267
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
ABOUT THIS BIG HARD-ON

46:31.300 --> 46:33.200
YOU'VE BEEN SPORTING
ALL NIGHT?

46:33.233 --> 46:35.633
I DON'T KNOW, JULIE.

46:35.667 --> 46:37.100
LET'S GO.

46:37.133 --> 46:39.200
WE CAN'T. IT'S RUDE.

46:39.233 --> 46:40.633
I'M GOING NUTS.

46:40.667 --> 46:41.767
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER

46:41.800 --> 46:43.367
I CAN STAND IT.

46:54.767 --> 46:57.633
HELENA,
LOVELY TO SEE YOU.

46:57.667 --> 46:58.733
NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN.

46:58.767 --> 46:59.900
HOW ARE YOU?

47:00.067 --> 47:00.500
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
REMARKING TO JIM...

47:12.700 --> 47:14.067
OH, GOD, CAPTAIN STUBING,

47:14.100 --> 47:16.333
I WANT YOUR BIG DICK INSIDE ME
SO BAD.

47:20.533 --> 47:21.633
I JUST HOPE MY WIFE
MARION ROSS

47:21.667 --> 47:23.100
DOESN'T FIND OUT
ABOUT US.

47:23.133 --> 47:24.967
NO, MARION ROSS
WAS THE ACTRESS.

47:25.067 --> 47:26.700
THE CHARACTER'S NAME
WAS EMILY.

47:29.400 --> 47:30.667
OH, GOD.

47:32.133 --> 47:34.167
OH, MY...

47:34.200 --> 47:36.433
OH, FUCK.

47:37.633 --> 47:38.600
OH, GOD.

47:38.633 --> 47:39.600
OH, GOD.

47:39.633 --> 47:41.967
OH, GOD. OH, YEAH.

47:42.067 --> 47:42.967
OH, MY GOD.

47:43.067 --> 47:44.133
OH, GOD.

47:44.167 --> 47:45.133
OH, GOD.

47:45.167 --> 47:46.133
OH, NO.

47:46.167 --> 47:47.133

47:47.167 --> 47:48.300
OH, NO.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.133
OW! GOD!

47:50.167 --> 47:51.100
I...

47:56.400 --> 48:00.700
[VOMITING]

48:00.733 --> 48:03.933
OKAY, I'M COMING, BABY,
I'M COMING.

48:12.767 --> 48:14.600
YOU TRYING TO TOP ME?

48:14.633 --> 48:16.433
WHAT, YOU THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO TOP ME?

48:34.867 --> 48:36.167
UH, SHIT.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.733
LOOK, I HAVE A FAVOR
TO ASK OF YOU.

48:37.767 --> 48:38.933
YEAH.

48:38.967 --> 48:40.067
THINGS ARE
A LITTLE, UM...

48:40.100 --> 48:42.067
THEY'RE A LITTLE...

48:42.067 --> 48:45.067
DIFFERENT
IN MY ROOM...

48:45.067 --> 48:46.200
MM-HMM.

48:46.233 --> 48:49.267
AND I SEE THAT YOU
HAVE A COUCH.

48:49.300 --> 48:50.900
YES.

48:50.933 --> 48:52.967
WELL, WOULD YOU MIND?

48:53.067 --> 48:55.300
YOU WANT TO
CRASH ON MY COUCH?

48:55.333 --> 48:58.667
AS IN, SLEEP,
JUST SLEEP?

48:58.700 --> 48:59.633
NO...

48:59.667 --> 49:02.200
SLEEP, ENTIRELY.

49:02.233 --> 49:03.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?

49:03.400 --> 49:05.400
THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC
TO ME.

49:05.433 --> 49:07.400
I AM COMPLETELY
EXHAUSTED.

49:07.433 --> 49:10.067
OKAY, GOOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

49:10.100 --> 49:11.133
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

49:11.167 --> 49:12.200
NO, THANK YOU.

49:12.233 --> 49:13.367
HEY, UM...

49:13.400 --> 49:14.967
JUST DO ME ONE FAVOR.

49:15.067 --> 49:16.967
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

49:17.067 --> 49:18.433
NO. I SWEAR.

49:18.467 --> 49:19.633
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

49:19.667 --> 49:20.633
EXCELLENT.

49:20.667 --> 49:21.767
THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.467
SLEEP WELL.
YOU TOO.

49:54.267 --> 49:56.267
DAD, IS...

49:56.300 --> 49:57.733
YOU'RE NOT EATING YOUR DINNER.

49:57.767 --> 49:58.933
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH IT?

49:58.967 --> 50:00.967
OH, IT'S DELICIOUS.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.567
I'M JUST
TAKING MY TIME.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.267
[COUGHS]

50:09.300 --> 50:10.767
EXCUSE ME.

50:13.833 --> 50:14.800
DADDY!

50:14.833 --> 50:15.733

50:24.500 --> 50:26.333
FOR AT-RISK KIDS...

50:26.367 --> 50:27.633
NO, NO.

50:27.667 --> 50:30.233
COME TO THE HOSPITAL. CEDARS.

50:30.267 --> 50:32.800
OKAY.

50:32.833 --> 50:35.300
MS. TINA KENNARD...

50:35.333 --> 50:37.400
[APPLAUSE]

50:40.767 --> 50:42.967
WOULD ALL FIVE

50:43.000 --> 50:45.733
PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE ON THE DAIS?

50:48.600 --> 50:50.333
THESE FIVE INDIVIDUALS

50:50.367 --> 50:52.733
ARE EXTRAORDINARY
IN THEIR ABILITY

50:52.767 --> 50:54.800
TO WALK IN MANY WORLDS,

50:54.833 --> 50:59.367
AND TO HOLD THE BIG VISION
THAT UNITES DIVERSE COMMUNITIES.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.067
THEY INSPIRE ALL OF US

51:01.067 --> 51:02.933
TO RISE ABOVE
DIVISIONS

51:02.967 --> 51:03.733
AND DIFFERENCES.

51:03.767 --> 51:04.867
IT IS MY HONOR

51:04.900 --> 51:08.300
TO PRESENT THIS YEAR'S
COMMUNITY ACTIVIST AWARDS.

51:28.933 --> 51:30.867
HEY.

51:30.900 --> 51:32.967
HEY.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.433
UM, I'M JUST
GOING TO GET MY KEYS.

51:38.067 --> 51:40.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

51:43.500 --> 51:44.800
WHAT ARE THOSE?

51:44.833 --> 51:47.467
THEY'RE CAMERAS.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.533
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE TAPES?

51:49.567 --> 51:50.933
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO SHOW YOU,

51:50.967 --> 51:53.067
AND, UM...

51:53.100 --> 51:55.067
AND THEN, AFTER THAT,
I DON'T KNOW, UM...

51:55.067 --> 51:57.567
YOU'LL PROBABLY
WANT ME OUT OF HERE.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.567
IT'S GOING TO
TAKE ME--

51:58.600 --> 52:00.233
WHAT'S GOING ON, MARK?

52:00.267 --> 52:01.533
I JUST FINISHED
TAKING DOWN

52:01.567 --> 52:04.533
THE LAST
OF THE CAMERAS.

52:04.567 --> 52:06.467
I PRETTY MUCH HAD THEM
ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.933
UM...

52:07.967 --> 52:09.600
JENNY SAW...

52:09.633 --> 52:12.233
A TAPE I'D MADE
OF THE TWO OF YOU.

52:12.267 --> 52:13.800
SHIT.

52:13.833 --> 52:15.300
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU,

52:15.333 --> 52:15.933
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO RUIN

52:15.967 --> 52:17.400
YOUR VACATION.

52:46.067 --> 52:48.067
JENNY, WAIT A MINUTE,
LISTEN TO ME.

52:48.067 --> 52:49.767
IF YOU HEARD
THIS TAPE

52:49.800 --> 52:50.767
OR THIS CONVERSATION,

52:50.800 --> 52:52.867
THEN YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID,

52:52.900 --> 52:54.967
AND I SAID THAT IT IS FUN
AND EASY TO BE WITH YOU,

52:55.067 --> 52:57.467
THAT I WANT
TO MAKE IT WORK WITH YOU.

52:57.500 --> 53:01.100
IT'S OKAY...

53:01.133 --> 53:03.367
THAT WE'RE NOT MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER,

53:03.400 --> 53:04.600
AND I KNOW

53:04.633 --> 53:06.667
THAT THE ONLY REASON
WHY YOU'RE WITH ME

53:06.700 --> 53:09.867
IS BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO BE NEAR SHANE.

53:09.900 --> 53:12.100
THAT IS BULLSHIT, JENNY.

53:24.100 --> 53:26.400
SHANE IS MY
BEST FRIEND,

53:26.433 --> 53:30.467
AND I DON'T WANT TO FUCK IT UP.

53:32.667 --> 53:33.600
OKAY?
