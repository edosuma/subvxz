08:49.445 --> 08:51.447

08:51.530 --> 08:53.699

BREACH IN IONIC REACTOR CORE.

08:55.868 --> 09:00.873
TOTAL REACTOR MELTDOWN IN

[tense music]

09:03.501 --> 09:06.128
[alarm blaring]

09:06.212 --> 09:08.089
- WE NEED TO RESTABILIZE
THE CORE.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.757
- [grunting]

09:09.840 --> 09:12.218
TOO LATE. THE HEAT HAS ALREADY
MELTED THE HATCH SHUT.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.178
- DOESN'T MATTER.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.638
EVEN IF WE COULD GET IN THERE,

09:15.721 --> 09:16.973
ONLY A COCKROACH COULD
WITHSTAND THAT MUCH RADIATION,

09:17.056 --> 09:20.351
AND HE'S CURRENTLY
BEATING THE TAR OUT OF HIMSELF.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.852
- [grunts]

09:21.936 --> 09:22.395
- WAIT!

09:22.478 --> 09:24.021
I HAVE AN IDEA.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.022
- IS IT RACING STRIPES?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.148
'CAUSE WE ALREADY TRIED THAT.

- HEY, FUN DR. "C."

09:41.664 --> 09:44.458
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SAVE THE DAY!

09:44.542 --> 09:45.626
FORGET ABOUT THE SCIENTIST.

09:45.710 --> 09:50.089
WE NEED SOMEONE MAD ENOUGH
TO FIX THIS!

09:50.172 --> 09:51.757
- YOU ARE LOCO!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.759
THIS IS A SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.346
WE NEED THE BORING BUT SENSIBLE
DR. "C" ALL THE WAY!

09:57.430 --> 09:59.307

10:00.766 --> 10:01.642
- OH, WELL.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.102
NO ONE IS BRILLIANT ENOUGH

10:03.185 --> 10:07.064
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET INTO
THAT CORE IN TIME ANYWAY.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.399
- I WILL ADJUST
THE TRANSPORTER COORDINATES

10:08.482 --> 10:11.193
AND BEAM MYSELF RIGHT
INTO THE HEART OF THE REACTOR

10:11.277 --> 10:14.155
IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THE CORE.

10:14.238 --> 10:16.699
- NOT IF I GET THERE FIRST!

10:24.123 --> 10:24.749
[both yelling]

10:28.502 --> 10:30.004
- WHOLE ONCE AGAIN.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.090
- 17 SECONDS UNTIL
FULL IONIC MELTDOWN.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.467
- WE SHALL SEE ABOUT THAT!

10:45.811 --> 10:49.190
6, 5, 4, 3...

10:49.273 --> 10:50.399
- A BIT OF CHEWING GUM

10:50.483 --> 10:53.819
AND THIS FOIL WRAPPER.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.237
- IONIC CORE STABILIZED.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.157
REACTOR MELTDOWN AVOIDED.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.700
- WHOO-HOO!

10:59.784 --> 11:00.951
YES, THAT'S RIGHT!

11:01.035 --> 11:02.078
I DID IT!

11:02.161 --> 11:03.412
[cackles]

11:03.496 --> 11:04.580
- I GUESS THERE WAS ONE THING

11:04.663 --> 11:06.207
THOSE TWO HAD IN COMMON
THE WHOLE TIME.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.875
- [cackles]

11:07.958 --> 11:09.293
- AN ENORMOUS EGO.

- BINGO.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.267
[tense music]

11:25.351 --> 11:27.186
- SOMEBODY HELP!

11:27.269 --> 11:29.563
WE'VE GOT RUNAWAY MISSILES!

11:42.785 --> 11:45.079
- [laughs]

11:45.162 --> 11:46.747
- HUGS, EVERYBODY!

11:50.626 --> 11:51.794
WHOO! NAILED IT.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.971
- ALL YOU NEED TO DO

12:02.054 --> 12:05.433
IS DISABLE
THE TRIGGERING MECHANISM.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.976
- UH, YEAH, TRIGGERING WHAT NOW?

12:07.059 --> 12:07.977
- NEVER MIND.

12:08.060 --> 12:08.811
[both yelling]

12:12.523 --> 12:14.150
- AT LEAST TELL ME
IT LOOKED COOL.

12:14.233 --> 12:14.859
- IT DID.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.611
- THAT'S ALL I ASK.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.655
- I THINK IT'S DANDY
THAT TEAM MONSTER

12:19.738 --> 12:21.198
STOPPED THE RUNAWAY MISSILES.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.408
IF ONLY TEAM MONSTER

12:22.491 --> 12:23.909
HADN'T LAUNCHED
THE RUNAWAY MISSILES!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.912
- [electronic voice] LAUNCH.
LAUNCH. LAUNCH. LAUNCH.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.622
- COME ON. WHERE'S MY LUNCH?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.458
I'M HUNGRY.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.377
IS ANYBODY ELSE HAVING ISSUES
WITH THE LUNCH BUTTON?

12:33.461 --> 12:34.753
- THAT IS SOME CLASSIC B.O.B.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.005
- B.O.B.?

12:36.088 --> 12:36.922
B.O.B.!

12:40.968 --> 12:42.303
B.O.B.,

12:42.386 --> 12:44.346
REMEMBER WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

12:44.430 --> 12:46.599
"LAUNCH" AND "LUNCH"?

12:46.682 --> 12:47.558
- OH, YEAH.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.517
NOW, THAT REMINDS ME,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.811
HAS ANYONE SEEN MY LAUNCH BOX?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.980
- SON, IF YOU HAD A BRAIN,

12:53.063 --> 12:54.565
YOU'D BE DANGEROUS.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.194
- OH, DR. COCKROACH.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.361
I WAS THINKING--

12:59.445 --> 13:00.196
WHICH, SINCE I'VE GOT NO BRAIN,

13:00.279 --> 13:01.238
ISN'T EASY,

13:01.322 --> 13:02.490
BELIEVE YOU ME--

13:02.573 --> 13:04.742
- I BELIEVE YOU, B.O.B.
- RIGHT.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.329
ANYWAY,
YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH BRAIN.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.205
MAYBE I COULD
HAVE SOME OF YOURS.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.373
- HA.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.833
MY RATHER SUBSTANTIAL CEREBELLUM

13:12.917 --> 13:15.002
IS SAFELY HOUSED
WITHIN MY CRANIUM.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.170

13:35.439 --> 13:36.482
- LET ME GUESS.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.359
YOU PULLED THE PARTS
FROM THE VACUUM CLEANER.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.403
- [sighs] I DIDN'T THINK
ANYONE WOULD NOTICE.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.738
MISTAKES LEARNED FROM.

ONTO PROGRESS.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.243

- BECAUSE...

13:56.001 --> 13:57.628
- SOMEONE WAS USING

14:04.426 --> 14:06.554
MY PLAN TO INCREASE
EARTH'S MUGGINESS IS--

14:06.637 --> 14:07.596
- EAT 'EM WITH MEAT!

- WHAT?
- DOUGHNUTS! EAT 'EM WITH MEAT!

14:23.612 --> 14:25.531

WHAT IS THAT?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.796
AN ARTIFICIAL BRAIN?

14:40.879 --> 14:42.047
- GO AWAY.

14:42.131 --> 14:42.965
- RIGHT.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.008
OH, LOOK AT THE TIME.

A RATHER STRONG PARADIGM SHIFT

15:48.447 --> 15:50.574
IN MY STATE OF BEING.

- IT WORKED!

15:51.867 --> 15:53.786
YOU HAVE INTELLIGENCE!

15:53.869 --> 15:56.830
- SUCH AN OBVIOUS OBSERVATION,
DOCTOR.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.542
TO BE EXPECTED
WHEN ONE'S PhD IS IN DANCE.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.543

16:27.111 --> 16:28.696
PROBABLY HOSTILE. WHAT DO WE DO?

16:28.779 --> 16:29.905
- GET READY FOR A SMACK-DOWN

16:29.988 --> 16:30.948
BEFORE IT HITS GROUND.

16:31.031 --> 16:31.490
- USE MY REPULSER RAY

16:31.573 --> 16:33.450
TO KEEP IT AWAY.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.952
- ASK WHAT QUALIFIES YOU

16:35.035 --> 16:37.413
TO BE LEADING
THIS RIDICULOUS EXERCISE.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.747
- EXCUSE ME?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.290
- I MEAN,
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

"MAD" THAN "SCIENTIST."

16:49.508 --> 16:50.217
LOL.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.927
BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, SUSAN,

16:52.010 --> 16:56.014
YOU ARE AN AGGRESSIVELY
AVERAGE WOMAN.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.315
YOUR LEADERSHIP
SEEMS ONLY TO COME

17:21.749 --> 17:23.751
- LISTEN, ROBERT,

17:23.834 --> 17:24.792
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

17:24.877 --> 17:25.669
HOW TO SAY THIS GENTLY, BUT--

17:25.752 --> 17:27.796
- TAKE THE STUPID BRAIN OUT!

17:27.880 --> 17:30.257
IT'S TURNING YOU INTO A JERK!

17:30.340 --> 17:31.258
- "GENTLY?"

17:31.341 --> 17:32.718
ANYBODY ELSE HEAR ME SAY THAT?

17:32.801 --> 17:34.011
- AH,

17:34.094 --> 17:36.889
YOU FEEL THE NEW ME
HAS BEEN UNNECESSARILY BRUSQUE

17:36.972 --> 17:38.766
AND PERHAPS EVEN A TOUCH
IMPERTINENT WITH YOU.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.559
- TOOK THE WORDS
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.895
- WELL, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE,

17:42.978 --> 17:46.732
WHICH IS WHY I'VE WHIPPED UP
SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU ALL.

17:46.815 --> 17:47.983
WHERE DID I--

17:48.067 --> 17:50.694
AH, HERE THEY ARE.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.070

I PROMISE,

17:56.325 --> 17:57.367
WHAT'S IN THIS BOX

17:57.451 --> 18:00.370
IS SOMETHING
YOU GENUINELY DESERVE.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.002
THIS STUFF...

18:07.086 --> 18:08.712
I--I CAN'T BREAK IT.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.005
- YOU'VE REACHED INTO MY HEAD

18:10.088 --> 18:11.465
AND DRAWN FORTH
MY GREATEST FEAR.

18:11.548 --> 18:15.719
- GENERAL MONGER DID SAY I'D BE
DANGEROUS IF I HAD A BRAIN.

18:18.096 --> 18:20.140
HOW CORRECT HE WAS.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.935
[cackles]

18:23.018 --> 18:23.977
- B.O.B.--

18:24.061 --> 18:25.103
ROBERT--WHATEVER--

18:25.187 --> 18:27.022
IF YOU THINK
THIS CAN HOLD ME--

18:27.105 --> 18:27.940
YEOW!

18:28.023 --> 18:30.025
YOU'RE KIND OF ONTO SOMETHING.

18:30.108 --> 18:31.485
- BUT WHY, B.O.B.?

18:31.568 --> 18:32.986
WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.154
- PLEASE.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.573
I'M TOO SMART FOR FRIENDS!

18:36.657 --> 18:37.991
MY NEW PLAYGROUND PARTNER

18:38.075 --> 18:40.285
IS "CONQUEST OF THE WORLD."

18:40.369 --> 18:42.454
I'M OFF TO SUBJUGATE
THE WORLD TO MY WILL.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.873
TA!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.042
- YOU HAVE DONE WELL, ROBERT.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.253
TOGETHER, OUR COMBINED INTELLECT

18:49.336 --> 18:51.380
WILL BRING THIS PLANET TO ITS--

18:51.463 --> 18:53.090
[gasps]
FOR ME?!

18:53.173 --> 18:54.258
[cackles]

18:54.341 --> 18:55.884
- SO YOU KNEW HE TRAPPED US...

18:55.968 --> 18:56.885
BUT YOU STILL OPENED
YOUR PRESENT.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.887
- AND THEN PUT IT ON.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.681
- I LIKE HATS.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.684
HOW WAS I TO KNOW IT WAS
AN ANTI-TELEKINESIS HAT?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.772
- PARDON ME, BUT CAN YOU CONFIRM

19:08.856 --> 19:11.650
THAT THIS IS INDEED THE LOCATION
OF THE DEATH RAY?

19:11.733 --> 19:12.442
- IT IS.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.777
- DUH...

19:13.861 --> 19:15.863
I LEFT MY GUM IN THERE.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.282
CAN I GO IN FOR A SEC?

19:18.365 --> 19:19.032
I WON'T BREAK NOTHIN'.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.743
I'M TOO STUPID. HEH.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.412
- SURE THING, B.O.B.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.081
YOU KNOW, IF HE HAD A BRAIN,

19:26.164 --> 19:26.248
HE'D BE DANGEROUS.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.752
- HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET:

19:30.836 --> 19:31.837
WHY HAS B.O.B.
SUDDENLY GONE EVIL?

19:31.920 --> 19:33.422
- EASY. SMART EQUALS EVIL.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.465
- AHEM.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.508
CERTAINLY NOT.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.718
SOMEONE MUST HAVE TINKERED

19:37.801 --> 19:39.303
WITH THE ARTIFICIAL BRAIN.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.763
BUT WHO WOULD HAVE DONE
SUCH A THING?

19:43.932 --> 19:45.893
- I SUSPECT THE NIGHT JANITOR.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.145
OH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

19:48.228 --> 19:49.104
DOUG?

19:49.187 --> 19:50.606
I SUSPECT DOUG.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.024
TAKE A LOOK AT DOUG.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.152
DOUG.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.322
NOW, JUST HOW WILL WE ESCAPE
THESE TRAPS, HMM?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.115
ANY THOUGHTS?

20:00.198 --> 20:01.575
- I'M GOING TO TRY SOMETHING.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.284
IT MIGHT HURT,

20:02.367 --> 20:04.328
BUT I'M TRYING IT.

20:04.411 --> 20:04.786
[yells]

20:04.870 --> 20:06.496
- OW!

20:06.580 --> 20:07.956
WAS THAT NECESSARY?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.083
- KIND OF, YEAH.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.001
- OH.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.336
OH, YES, I GET IT NOW.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.759
- [grunts]

20:20.260 --> 20:21.553
- HOLD UP, GUYS.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.763
WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SMARTEST
BEING ON THE PLANET.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.474
- [scoffs]
HARDLY.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.059
- YOU PUT ON THE HAT.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.352
- LET'S JUST BRING
OUR A-PLUS GAME, OKAY?

20:31.897 --> 20:34.942
- [cackles]

20:35.025 --> 20:35.776
- OOH!

20:35.859 --> 20:36.610
A GIFT! MAYBE IT'S A HAT!

20:36.693 --> 20:39.404
both: NO!

20:39.488 --> 20:42.532
- MY,
ISN'T THIS A FAMILIAR TABLEAU?

20:42.616 --> 20:43.492
[chuckles]

20:43.575 --> 20:44.826
- OKAY, YOU GOT US, ROBERT.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.036
WE WERE STUPID.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.039
- SOME OF US MORE THAN OTHERS.

20:49.122 --> 20:49.998
- [groans]

20:50.082 --> 20:51.750
- YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY SMART.

20:51.833 --> 20:52.834
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.670
EXCEPT YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT BEING SMART

20:54.753 --> 20:55.796
DOESN'T MAKE YOU SPECIAL.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.131
BEING B.O.B.
IS WHAT MADE YOU SPECIAL.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.342
BEING B.O.B.
WAS WHAT MATTERED TO US,

21:00.425 --> 21:02.177
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.512
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, B.O.B.?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.472
WHY NOT JUST TURN OFF
THAT OLD DEATH RAY

21:05.555 --> 21:06.765
AND COME HOME TO THE MONSTERS
WHO LOVE YOU.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.101
- AH, SUSAN.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.936
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
SLOP ON THE SENTIMENTALITY

21:11.019 --> 21:13.397
AND I'LL GO ALL GOOEY.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.024
COCKROACH DIDN'T
MAKE ME A HEART.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.360
HE MADE ME A BRAIN!

21:18.443 --> 21:19.361
HA!

21:19.444 --> 21:21.571
[cackles]

21:24.533 --> 21:26.201
OOH.

21:26.284 --> 21:26.785
WHAAA?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.121
HEY, GUYS,

21:29.204 --> 21:31.623
REMEMBER THAT GIANT BUBBLE
MACHINE I WISHED FOR?

21:31.707 --> 21:32.708
HERE IT IS!

21:32.791 --> 21:34.376
- WELL, I WASN'T THINKING THAT.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.627
- IT WORKS. TAKE IT.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.714
- WAS THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL?

21:38.797 --> 21:39.381
- NOPE.

21:39.464 --> 21:40.048
- BUT YOU ARE, B.O.B.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.217
- AW, THANKS, SUSAN.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.760
NOW, WHO'S HUNGRY?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.762
I COULD REALLY GO
FOR SOME LAUNCH!
