[Jessica] <i>Most stations,</i>
<i>there is no beat reporting anymore</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.585
<i>because the companies can't afford it.</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:48.214
<i>But for as long as we've been around,</i>
<i>there has been a crime reporter,</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:50.008
<i>and that hasn't wavered.</i>

00:51.342 --> 00:53.386
That is the only beat that we have,

00:53.470 --> 00:56.848

That was City of Flint.
That wasn't a county situation.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.654
It's violent, and it's busy,

01:11.738 --> 01:14.074
and I came from up north,

01:14.157 --> 01:16.076
where I covered festivals

01:16.159 --> 01:19.287
and apple fests, and that kind of thing.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.414
I remember my first week here,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.875
and I was...

01:24.793 --> 01:27.295
like, "Holy shit. This just got real."

01:28.922 --> 01:33.968
[eerie music playing]

[Esther] Methamphetamines,
crystal ice, heroin, mushrooms,

01:46.856 --> 01:49.901
powder cocaine and crack cocaine,
and marijuana.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.195
I think they can figure that out, though.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.031
[officer] See how they put it
inside the diaper box?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.867
They put it in the baby's Pampers box.
That's cold.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.411
We're pretty much done with the guns.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.957
-[officer] First of all, God damn it!
-[Esther] That's the judge!

02:04.749 --> 02:07.335
Just fill the table. People love ammo.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.170
We cleared up the violent shit
and not just the drugs.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.842
[Jessica] <i>When Chief Johnson came in,</i>
<i>he created the C.A.T.T. Squad.</i>

02:13.925 --> 02:16.970
I would describe it as, like,
a pet project. Pardon the pun.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.305
But, you know,
sort of a pet project of his.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.641
<i>He's a bit more of a cowboy.</i>

02:22.308 --> 02:26.521
He's a bit more, "We're gonna do things
under the radar, under my guidance,

02:26.980 --> 02:31.067
and we're gonna get shit done
and not have to answer to Big Brother."

[officer #2] Police!

02:41.953 --> 02:44.831
[Jessica] <i>And that was the mentality</i>
<i>when he took over.</i>

02:44.914 --> 02:48.251
I'm sure that resonated
with a lot of people, too, you know?

02:48.334 --> 02:51.296
Pardon my French,
but, you know, "Fuck this."

02:52.171 --> 02:53.882
[Tim] Good morning, everyone.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.218
This is just the efforts of
the Crime Area Target Team in one month.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.596
This is what they have taken
off the streets.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.558
This would not be possible
without Mayor Weaver's support.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.518
I can't overstress that,

03:05.602 --> 03:09.439
because everything that I've asked for
from her office, I've gotten.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.358
So I just want to thank the Mayor
for her support

03:12.442 --> 03:14.277
in fighting crime in this city.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.446
She makes it a lot easier to do.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.156
Thank you, Mayor. Appreciate you.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.783
We can take questions
if you guys want to ask some questions.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.371
-That worked out!
-That's a first. Everybody's quiet.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.300
<i>off the streets</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:39.886

Hey, criminals, you've been getting away
with sh... stuff, for so long.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.646
Not anymore.

03:50.438 --> 03:53.441
[Scott] Many people who we've arrested,
they were like,

03:53.524 --> 03:56.903
"Oh, you guys are the guys
everybody's talking about."

03:57.320 --> 03:59.197
We want them to know that we're out there

03:59.280 --> 04:01.950
and if you're messing up,
we're gonna deal with you.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.995
I'm just proud that they're doing
the job they were asked to do,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.539
and that's what the mayor
brought me here for.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.251
I guarantee you,
we're not going in the wrong direction.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.336
We're definitely going
in the right direction.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.716
-[Sylvester] It's about law and order.
-[Kevin] That's all.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.303
People that don't care about law and order
are the ones that have got a problem.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.221
Yes.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.267
My thing is, if you care
about law and order, you're good.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.394
If you don't care about law and order,

04:29.477 --> 04:32.730
you're not gonna be a friend
of this administration.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.775
We have to retain Tim Johnson.
Here's what's gonna happen...

04:35.858 --> 04:37.568
The water thing is gonna die.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.612
But crime comes down.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.783
They're gonna say, "How did you do it
with 100 officers but not with 300?"

04:43.866 --> 04:44.867
Crime comes down.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.954
That's gonna start attracting
businesses and people.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.581
Your tax base is gonna go up
and that's more revenue.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.417
-Like I said...
-That's all we need.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.336
You can see the difference now,
but it's believing in it,

04:55.420 --> 04:57.422
and going out there every day to do it.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.383
-I guarantee it's gonna happen.
-I know it's going to.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.635
-It's gonna happen.
-I see it happening.

-Is that a yes?
-Yes.

07:23.484 --> 07:29.115
I'll put you on Stacey's team, and you'll

-You just won't be the OIC at first.
-OK.

07:32.201 --> 07:36.205

you need to see how it's done at first,

[Bridgette] <i>One of the reasons I wanted</i>

That's a really good place for it, retard.

So stupid. How do we do training
if you don't bring the shit you need?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.538
For those of you who brought them
and have them,

09:41.330 --> 09:44.208
we're targets,
more so than we've ever been,

09:44.292 --> 09:48.337
and a majority of survival wounds
that officers are dying from

09:48.421 --> 09:51.882
are coming from the limbs,
hence the tourniquet.

09:52.508 --> 09:56.095
I'm not saying you have to become
a jujitsu master with these things,

09:56.178 --> 09:58.264
but you want to get familiar with it,

09:58.347 --> 10:00.683
because just yesterday,
there were two more cops shot.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.560
The day before that, two were ambushed. They're shooting us in our fucking cars.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.606
And for no reason. And also keep in mind,

10:08.816 --> 10:11.944
the idea behind this is to keep you alive
and also keep you in the fight.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.030
If you're awake, you can fight.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.490
If you can hold your gun,
shoot it at a threat.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.327
The idea behind a tourniquet
is to stay in the fight and not quit,

10:20.369 --> 10:22.371
whether that means in the gun fight...

10:23.748 --> 10:25.291
or the fight for your life.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.044
Right now, you just took
a gunshot wound right here,

10:28.127 --> 10:31.005

[Jazmin] <i>When Dion first went out,</i>

11:06.999 --> 11:08.876

<i>No one's doing anything bad."</i>

<i>I called the police on Russell Street,</i>

25:32.739 --> 25:36.534
<i>and these motherfuckers keep walking</i>
<i>past my house with guns and shit,</i>

25:36.618 --> 25:38.078
<i>and nobody has pulled up yet!</i>

25:38.161 --> 25:39.913
<i>Me and my kids have to die out here?</i>

25:40.580 --> 25:42.540
[operator] <i>Genesee County 911.</i>

25:42.624 --> 25:44.334
[woman #3] <i>Yes, I'm calling again.</i>

25:44.417 --> 25:47.754
<i>They're shooting at my motherfucking house</i>
<i>and you haven't gotten here yet.</i>

25:47.837 --> 25:49.172
[operator] <i>You want the police?</i>

25:49.881 --> 25:51.675
[operator #2] <i>Genesee County 911.</i>

25:51.758 --> 25:54.177
[woman] <i>I've called the police</i>
<i>about four times.</i>

25:54.261 --> 25:55.762
[operator #2] <i>What's your address?</i>

25:55.845 --> 25:57.681
[woman] <i>I need you here now!</i>

25:57.764 --> 26:01.393
[operator #2] <i>I didn't speak with you</i>
<i>so you need to tell me what's going on.</i>

26:01.476 --> 26:03.853

26:04.396 --> 26:06.564
[chattering]

26:06.648 --> 26:09.317
OK, look. Call them one more time.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.487
[woman #2] Hello? The police.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.574
I just saw police ride past
about 40 times.

26:18.201 --> 26:21.121
[operator] <i>What was that regarding?</i>
<i>I haven't spoken to you yet.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:24.582
Some grown men were shooting at some kids.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.377
-[operator] <i>Where did this happen at?</i>
-[woman] On Russell.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.132
-<i>They were shot at, on Russell?</i>
-Yes.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.428
Not one police has pulled up on Russell.
It's been about an hour now.

26:37.804 --> 26:38.972
[operator] <i>OK.</i>

26:39.347 --> 26:42.100
<i>It looks like they're searching the area</i>
<i>for some people,</i>

26:42.183 --> 26:44.019
<i>but they're coming to speak to you.</i>

26:44.102 --> 26:47.022
If they come to me,
I can show them where the people are at.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.690
I know names, everything.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.066
My kids know...

26:50.150 --> 26:53.695
[operator] <i>That was the third shooting</i>
<i>they had today. They're backed up.</i>

26:53.778 --> 26:56.531
<i>They're checking the area</i>
<i>and will come speak with you.</i>

26:56.614 --> 26:57.741
OK.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.409
<i>Alright, bye-bye.</i>

26:59.492 --> 27:01.119
They're searching the area.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.748
Well, who are they searching for?
Do they know who?

27:04.831 --> 27:07.042
They don't even know the name
they're looking for.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.836
That's what I don't understand.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.464
There are too many kids here
for somebody to be shooting.

27:12.547 --> 27:16.593
And then they shot all their bullets out
and shot again.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.973
They shot so many times.
So many bullets flew through here.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.517
[woman #2]
They want shit like this to happen.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.186
They want us to kill each other,

27:26.269 --> 27:29.105
so there won't be no more shit
they have to come to. That's why all our young black boys
keep getting killed.

27:34.652 --> 27:35.904
Don't make no sense.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.950
[woman] <i>I've heard about</i>
<i>the new operations with Flint Police.</i>

27:41.826 --> 27:43.578
But has anything changed?

27:44.579 --> 27:45.413
No.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.957
We have people shooting,
and police don't show up.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.585
Why can't we get a policeman out
when we call?

27:50.668 --> 27:52.128
I'm just gonna stop calling.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.381
I don't know what they're doing.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.883
They go, "Oh, we have the numbers."

27:56.966 --> 27:59.969
OK, well, what crime are you stopping?

28:00.345 --> 28:03.932
I don't think that it's a mystery

28:04.516 --> 28:06.476
as to what Flint may need.

28:06.559 --> 28:09.437
I just think that it's not a priority.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.109
Here come the police!

28:14.192 --> 28:16.486
Finally, after two hours.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.406
[woman #2] How are you doing? Hi.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.199
I have a four-year-old son.

28:21.282 --> 28:22.867
We're coming home -

28:22.951 --> 28:26.830
a gold Yukon comes to the corner
right here, lets shots off.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.039
[woman] So many shots.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.792
So he's walking down the street,
just shooting.

28:31.626 --> 28:35.255
-One of the dudes ran in that house.
-[woman] Yeah, sure did.

28:38.633 --> 28:43.555

29:05.118 --> 29:08.121
I can't tell you
the frustration we see daily.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.998
[Jessica] <i>911 director Dave Ackley,</i>

29:10.081 --> 29:13.543

29:13.626 --> 29:17.213
<i>He believed as many as 20 officers</i>

29:27.974 --> 29:30.435
The Crime Area Target Team

29:31.102 --> 29:34.439

that by Christmas we'll be down 50%.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.742

29:54.751 --> 29:58.797
[Robert] Are you trying to see if he's OK,
or trying to notify him of something?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.050
OK, what's the number of the...

30:02.133 --> 30:05.637
Ma'am, you're running at 100 miles an hour
and I got a lot going on.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.139
What's the police station's name?
Where is it?

30:09.182 --> 30:11.184
Alright? Yes, ma'am.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.521
[sighs]

30:15.772 --> 30:18.316
[phone rings]

30:18.399 --> 30:21.569
Flint Police, Sergeant Frost.
You say you want to cancel it?

30:24.405 --> 30:28.117
Ma'am! Jesus Christ,
I'm trying to talk to you. Slow down.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.577
You say you want to cancel?

30:31.329 --> 30:32.789
Consider it cancelled, ma'am.

30:33.581 --> 30:36.835
Jesus Christ. All she wanted to do
was cancel the call.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.921
You called it in. You don't want
the call anymore. We're done.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.631
No need for a huge explanation.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.844
We have four cars on the road
for 100,000 people,

30:45.927 --> 30:47.804
and there's 50 calls on the board.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.597
And it's climbing.

30:49.681 --> 30:54.269
We were at 43 calls down when we went
to roll call, and now we're up to 45.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.357
"Domestic, unknown trouble,
domestic, domestic..."

30:59.983 --> 31:03.111
"Larceny"? That isn't gonna be on there.

31:03.194 --> 31:07.782
"Domestic, welfare check, shots fired,
alarm, alarm, suspicious."

31:09.033 --> 31:14.539
Or there's four different places
where there's trees laying in the road.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.375
Animals are attacking people over here.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.086
Like I said,
there's 50 calls on the board,

31:20.169 --> 31:23.214
and there's four cars to run all that.

31:24.173 --> 31:28.678
We'll never get this caught up, tonight.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.680
[Jessica] <i>We had a chuckle.</i>

31:30.763 --> 31:34.767
You're 40 deep in calls
when officers come on,

31:34.851 --> 31:37.604
and you're gonna start a special unit?

31:38.104 --> 31:40.565
This is the only desk
answering the phone right now.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.774
How can I help you?

31:42.984 --> 31:46.487
[Jessica] <i>The chief is trying,</i>
<i>but they can't even keep up with calls.</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:47.989
Forget "proactive."

31:48.072 --> 31:50.450
I mean, that's just not even
really a thing.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.578
I'm not saying what they're doing
isn't important,

31:53.661 --> 31:57.832
but it's, like, two steps forward,
one step backward for this city.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.251
I mean, it cannot catch a break.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.546
It's sort of unbelievable, actually.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.689
Two hundred. We got an A-car there.

[John] Where are you shot, partner?
OK, don't move. Don't move.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.767
-[John] Where were they at when they shot?
I don't know. We were just...

33:39.851 --> 33:42.979
[John] Did they shoot into the house?
OK, sit tight.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.356
We've got one coming for you.
Don't move.

33:45.606 --> 33:46.733
Alright?

33:46.816 --> 33:50.778
-Come on, baby. We're soldiers.
-[John] Stay down there.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.156
-[man] We're soldiers.
-Stop talking. Stop talking.

33:53.239 --> 33:56.909
-[John] All these are bullet holes?
-[woman] Yes.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.913
[man] Why are they walking past us?
I'm right here.

to take care of the kid?

34:12.717 --> 34:15.719
[friend] Hey, bro, we know the same thing.
Know what I'm saying?

34:15.803 --> 34:16.971
[man] I know.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.306
[chattering]

34:18.389 --> 34:21.851
-[woman] She's grazed in the head.
-[officer] Well, I'm not sure.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.437
She's got it
in the back of the head, though.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.273
Hey, listen to me, man.
You're alright, OK?

34:27.356 --> 34:30.525
Hey, bud, I got a question for you.
Who shot this house up?

34:30.610 --> 34:32.695
[man] I swear to God, I don't know.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.532
-[John] You know who shot you?
-[friend] No. We just came to the door.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.703
[John] They know who did it.
They're just not saying.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.998
[friend] Yeah, dawg. Soldier.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.125
[man groans]

34:51.505 --> 34:54.717
[John] What's going on?
You doing alright? Good, good.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.595
This community is tired of this.

34:57.678 --> 35:00.431
We've had six shootings
at this house, or more.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.101
We might have to try a different route.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.938
[John] C.A.T.T. was designed for this.
And it didn't start until ten.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.398
They weren't here for this one.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.568
[woman] I've been
in this community 55 years,

35:13.444 --> 35:16.823
and it's a lot different
than when I first moved here.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.533
We were the first blacks.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.535
-[John] A good time?
-Man, come on.

35:21.160 --> 35:25.915
You could put your bikes on the lawn...
and leave the screen unlocked.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.002
You know what I'm saying? And it's sad.

35:30.545 --> 35:35.925
What's gonna happen? Are they just waiting
for somebody... one of our kids to die?

35:36.008 --> 35:38.553
I mean, what do you want?
You know what I'm saying?

35:38.636 --> 35:40.596
We're crying, saying "let's do this,"

35:40.680 --> 35:43.766
but because it's black-on-black crime,
nobody is listening.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.726
They think this is how we live. It's not.

35:45.810 --> 35:50.857
You got God-fearing, church-going people
who have worked and pay taxes,

35:50.940 --> 35:53.776
and do everything
that they're supposed to, to live right

35:53.860 --> 35:55.444
and raise their families,

35:55.528 --> 35:57.155
and we're still getting it, like...
