WEBVTT

00:06.541 --> 00:07.791
It's so hot.

00:09.083 --> 00:10.125
Where am I?

00:27.666 --> 00:32.333
CHICKEN & BEER

00:38.541 --> 00:39.708
Is it here?

00:43.416 --> 00:45.291
I haven't seen him in a while.

00:46.083 --> 00:46.916
Where is he?

00:47.416 --> 00:48.666
Hello.

00:53.875 --> 00:54.791
Where is he?

00:55.625 --> 00:56.750
-Hey!
-Oh!

00:56.833 --> 00:59.375
You surprised me. Hi! How have you been?

00:59.458 --> 01:00.583
KIM YEON-KOUNG, PAIK JONG-WON

01:00.666 --> 01:02.916
-How are you?
-I'm okay.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.541
-When'd you get back?
-What?

01:04.625 --> 01:07.041
-From Jeju.
-From Jeju…

01:08.041 --> 01:08.916
Four days ago?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.166
-I see.
-Yes.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.208
How have you been?

01:11.291 --> 01:13.083
-Same old.
-You look better.

01:13.791 --> 01:15.375
Right back to you.

01:15.458 --> 01:16.833
I put makeup on.

01:18.541 --> 01:19.666
Did you wait a while?

01:19.750 --> 01:21.875
-I just got here.
-Oh, yeah?

01:21.958 --> 01:23.791
It's been a while.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.708
I know.

01:26.083 --> 01:28.083
-We always meet for chicken.
-Exactly.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.166
Back then, too.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.125
-Was it Pyeongtaek?
-Yeah.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.166
CHICKEN CLUB

01:32.250 --> 01:34.416
-Dakboggeum-tang with old chicken.
-Right.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.916
-I actually like chicken.
-Do you?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.833
Yeah, I love everything chicken.

01:38.916 --> 01:40.750
Do you like drinking, by the way?

01:40.833 --> 01:41.875
Drinking…

01:41.958 --> 01:44.375
-I can drink.
-What's your limit?

01:44.458 --> 01:45.333
-My limit?
-Yeah.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.250
I actually don't know.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.458
-It changes each time.
-Yikes.

01:50.541 --> 01:51.666
It depends every time.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.000
If I'm not feeling great.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.583
But you don't get drunk on beer.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.166
Beer is…

01:57.916 --> 01:59.333
Is that not true?

01:59.416 --> 02:00.541
You must drink a lot.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.000
I can't drink a lot.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.708
You can't?
Are you getting drunk on me today?

02:07.291 --> 02:10.000
-I thought you were a light drinker.
-I can drink some.

02:10.458 --> 02:11.583
Draft beer?

02:11.666 --> 02:13.291
I like draft.

02:16.791 --> 02:17.625
Chicken?

02:18.250 --> 02:19.416
-Yeah.
-For munchies.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.625
-Sure.
-Before others eat it all.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.958
-Right.
-Before you got here,

02:23.041 --> 02:26.375
every time someone ordered,
I was afraid they'd run out.

02:27.125 --> 02:28.583
-Two 500cc draft beers.
-Sure.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.000
One rotisserie chicken.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.083
Thank you.

05:00.916 --> 05:01.875
Thank you.

05:03.083 --> 05:03.916
Here.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.833
Why are you turning?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.291
-You're older.
-What?

05:17.375 --> 05:19.458
-Don't worry about it.
-You're older.

05:20.666 --> 05:21.625
Nah.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.375
That makes me feel too old.

05:26.416 --> 05:27.833
It's nice and cold.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.375
It's good.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.083
It is good.

05:38.708 --> 05:39.541
This is it.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.666
When you drink ice cold draft beer

05:43.750 --> 05:45.750
and the beer travels down your throat…

05:45.833 --> 05:47.625
-Yeah.
-…and coats your stomach.

05:47.708 --> 05:50.333
Draft beer is the way to go.

05:51.000 --> 05:51.833
I like it.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.791
I wanted to thank you, by the way.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.958
-Why?
-When I was in Shanghai,

05:58.375 --> 06:00.375
I went to Guangzhou once.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.291
I saw a familiar face.
You are the god of Korean restaurants.

06:04.375 --> 06:07.416
It was my day off
and I wanted to get Korean food.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.500
And there you were.
Your face was on the building.

06:10.583 --> 06:11.958
So we were like, "What!"

06:12.041 --> 06:14.166
"Call him!" So I called you.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.625
Now that I think about it,
it was kind of rude.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.958
-I was just so happy to see your face.
-Nah.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.125
That's why I called.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.750
But you were kind enough
to answer our call.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.208
-Of course.
-Right.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.125
So I got treated so well that day.

06:27.208 --> 06:30.541
-They treated us well, thanks to you.
-It's nice to be recognized overseas.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.750
How was it then? It was rude, wasn't it?

06:32.833 --> 06:33.666
Not at all.

06:33.750 --> 06:34.583
"What the heck?"

06:34.666 --> 06:35.916
They didn't say that?

06:36.666 --> 06:39.000
-I might've thought that.
-Nah, you wouldn't.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.500
It's not the first time.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.458
Do others do it too?

06:43.541 --> 06:44.583
No.

06:44.666 --> 06:46.625
-It was really fine.
-You sure?

06:46.708 --> 06:49.250
I like you because you called me overseas

06:49.333 --> 06:53.250
after seeing my face on the restaurant ad

06:53.333 --> 06:56.125
because you were happy to see me.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.250
It wasn't because you wanted a free meal.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.625
I know that.

07:01.041 --> 07:04.750
I can tell from the tone
of the voice or the message.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.208
You were genuinely happy

07:06.291 --> 07:08.583
-that you saw me all the way there.
-Yeah?

07:08.666 --> 07:10.166
Then what I can do for you

07:10.250 --> 07:12.166
is tell you to go eat at my restaurant

07:12.250 --> 07:15.250
and give you specific directions

07:15.333 --> 07:18.708
and call the local manager
to go and welcome you in person.

07:18.791 --> 07:22.291
That's what I can do.
That was my way of showing sincerity.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.500
I really was happy you could come.

07:28.333 --> 07:33.125
-I really was glad to see your face.
-And I know how that feels.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.291
I told you to reach out anytime.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.833
You must've changed.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.791
-You didn't care about that.
-I don't.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.250
-But it must be the age. Sorry.
-Age?

07:42.333 --> 07:44.500
How old are you again?

07:44.583 --> 07:46.541
Thirty-four in Korea.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.583
-Yeah.
-Still a long way to go.

07:48.666 --> 07:49.958
Thirty-four.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.125
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.416
They froze the glasses.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.625
Draft beer these days…

08:06.708 --> 08:08.333
They put it in the fridge.

08:11.416 --> 08:14.500
We need our beer cold.

08:14.583 --> 08:15.791
Freeze the glasses, too.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.000
You've had beer overseas, right?

08:18.083 --> 08:20.666
Yeah, I used to play overseas.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.666
-You were in Japan.
-Yes.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.541
Then Turkey, then China.

08:24.625 --> 08:25.833
-Yes.
-Then Turkey again.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.833
-You've done your research.
-No. That's a given.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.750
I'm not a big sports fan

08:32.333 --> 08:33.958
but that much, I know.

08:36.291 --> 08:39.750
When you drink beer overseas
you notice unique features.

08:40.541 --> 08:41.916
Have you been to Vietnam?

08:42.000 --> 08:42.833
Yes, I have.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.333
-You get ice with beer.
-Yes.

08:44.416 --> 08:46.875
They put ice in the beer.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.291
I like that, too.

08:48.875 --> 08:51.500
It makes the beer cold and mild.

08:52.208 --> 08:55.750
Have you had beer in China?

08:56.708 --> 08:57.916
When were you there?

08:58.500 --> 09:01.291
-Recent, right?
-Yes.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.583
Three or four years ago.

09:02.666 --> 09:04.875
Don't they ask when you order beer?

09:04.958 --> 09:07.166
They ask you which beer you'd like.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.375
I don't mean the brand. "Cold or tepid?"

09:09.458 --> 09:11.458
-Yes.
-They ask, right?

09:11.541 --> 09:13.583
They don't drink cold beer.

09:13.666 --> 09:16.125
-Never.
-They are typically a bit bland.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.375
They call it
room-temperature or "changwen."

09:18.458 --> 09:19.541
Yes.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.083
You're right.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.166
When I first went to China,

09:52.833 --> 09:55.708
I would ask for the cold one
and they'd look at me funny.

09:55.791 --> 09:56.625
Yes.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.750
I didn't get it at first.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.000
My colleagues would drink warm beer.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.750
We need it cold.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.250
-When you drink it.
-Here, yes.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.500
That's the expectation.

10:05.583 --> 10:08.375
So I was surprised
the first time I saw it.

10:11.625 --> 10:12.958
-Don't turn around.
-What?

10:13.041 --> 10:14.750
-Really?
-The first glass was enough.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.083
-I won't turn then.
-Sure.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.041
Yes, boss.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.750
ROTISSERIE CHICKEN

11:38.750 --> 11:40.208
It's here.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.916
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.666
-Have you been doing this for a long time?
-Yes.

11:45.750 --> 11:46.791
I see.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.083
This is roasted, right?

11:50.166 --> 11:51.833
In the electric grill.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.750
Have you had this? Rotisserie chicken?

11:53.833 --> 11:55.875
-I have, before.
-Yeah?

11:55.958 --> 11:58.916
It must be healthier than the fried ones?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.458
Fried chicken isn't healthy?

12:00.541 --> 12:01.791
Fried ones, not so much.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.125
Watching weight? You don't look the type.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.416
A bit.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.458
Which chicken part do you like?
The breasts?

12:08.541 --> 12:11.333
Or the skin? Wings?

12:11.416 --> 12:13.166
I like the dry meat.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.708
-Dry meat?
-Yes.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.250
-You actually like dry meat?
-Yes.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.500
A pleasure to meet you.

12:19.583 --> 12:22.125
-No? You don't like dry meat?
-So glad we met.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.666
-Thank goodness.
-This makes us the perfect duo.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.750
-Thank you.
-Here.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.875
My middle sister likes dry meat
and overlaps with me.

12:29.958 --> 12:30.916
I am so happy.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.125
I like skin and other parts.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.041
Like this? Wings?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.083
You must like the drumsticks.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.416
I like drumsticks.

12:42.041 --> 12:43.666
I usually let others take it.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.750
But today, it's all mine.
The dry meat is yours.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.750
Nice.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.083
Thank you.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.416
Is it because you have to work out?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.708
No, I always preferred dry meat,
since I was little.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.625
-Really?
-Yes.

13:05.666 --> 13:06.708
It's good.

13:07.916 --> 13:08.791
Delicious.

13:22.416 --> 13:25.250
You debone your chicken very thoroughly.

13:26.250 --> 13:30.333
The way you eat is definitely different.

13:30.416 --> 13:31.250
Of course.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.416
My way of paying respect to food.

13:46.708 --> 13:48.833
When I was little, this was quite a hit.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.333
I…

13:51.166 --> 13:53.125
Mid '70s.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.416
Elementary school was called
"gukmin" school then.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.000
-Right.
-Back then,

13:57.916 --> 14:00.916
when father brought a chicken home,
it was an incredible day.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.791
Like Christmas

14:04.291 --> 14:07.333
when a father brings home a cake.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.500
ORIGINAL ROTISSERIE CHICKEN
NUTRITION CENTER

14:17.583 --> 14:20.041
It first came out in the '60s.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.291
Quite a sensation in the '60s and '70s.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.375
FOR PICNICS

14:23.458 --> 14:24.833
ORIGINAL ROTISSERIE CHICKEN
NUTRITION CENTER

14:24.916 --> 14:26.541
-First opened in Myeongdong.
-Yes.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.291
When it first opened…

14:28.375 --> 14:29.458
NUTRITION CENTER MAIN STORE

14:30.041 --> 14:32.041
…the price in today's terms…

14:32.750 --> 14:35.166
How much is jjajangmyeon now?
Six, five thousand won?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.125
Right.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.083
Ten times that.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.250
One chicken was 50,000-60,000 won.
That's how it felt.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.583
-Jjajangmyeon.
-Back then,

14:41.666 --> 14:44.166
jjajangmyeon was 15 won
and chicken, 150 won.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.333
Even then, it was sensational.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.208
Is your season over now?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.291
Yes, season's over and I'm resting.

14:56.958 --> 14:58.500
You must keep up with sports.

14:59.458 --> 15:00.958
I'm not interested in sports.

15:01.041 --> 15:01.875
Really?

15:02.958 --> 15:04.791
Then you must be interested in me.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.833
Yes, because I know you.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.416
I'm not a sports fan.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.791
You're one of the few athletes I know.

15:13.291 --> 15:14.666
You don't watch it either?

15:14.750 --> 15:15.583
Nope.

15:18.125 --> 15:18.958
For volleyball…

15:19.041 --> 15:20.250
JONG-WON'S ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF SPORTS CHARACTERS

15:20.333 --> 15:21.375
JANG YUN-CHANG
BANGKOK ASIAN GAME GOLD MEDALIST

15:21.458 --> 15:22.666
I know Jang Yun-chang.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.083
-Jang Yun-chang.
-You know?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.583
-Of course.
-Gang Man-su.

15:25.666 --> 15:27.583
GANG MAN-SU
MEXICO UNIVERSIAD GOLD MEDALIST

15:27.666 --> 15:28.750
CHA BUM-KUN
UNICEF WORLD ALL-STAR RESERVE

15:28.833 --> 15:30.791
For soccer,
I know Cha Bum-kun, Huh Jung-moo.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.125
HUH JUNG-MOO
PSV EINDHOVEN PLAYER

15:32.208 --> 15:34.041
-They're all older generation.
-Yeah?

15:36.166 --> 15:37.541
My sports data ends there.

15:42.958 --> 15:46.208
I'm so grateful you know about me
when you don't even like sports.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.583
That's common sense.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.541
I've also heard

15:55.041 --> 15:56.875
you were on the Cass commercial.

15:58.666 --> 16:02.041
I've always wanted
to star in that commercial.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.583
Beer ads are reserved for top models.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.416
Gong Yoo.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.708
Hyun Bin. These are the kind
of people that get to do it.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.208
They made a mistake choosing me.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.041
How long left in the contract?

16:30.208 --> 16:31.250
A few months, I think?

16:31.833 --> 16:32.791
-Yeah?
-Yup.

16:34.166 --> 16:37.125
Because when you're done,
maybe I can be the next Cass…

16:38.000 --> 16:39.583
-You want to be the model?
-Nah.

16:51.875 --> 16:52.708
It's nice.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.791
Two more 500cc, please.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.166
Thank you.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.208
Frozen glasses.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.333
This is it.

17:23.666 --> 17:26.541
Let me test you to see
if you qualify to be a beer model.

17:27.041 --> 17:29.833
What's the basic ingredient of beer?

17:29.916 --> 17:30.750
For beer?

17:31.375 --> 17:33.250
When they do the beer ads…

17:33.333 --> 17:34.791
-In the beer ads…
-Yes.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.583
…a good-looking model

17:37.083 --> 17:40.291
stands in some field
looking at a golden field.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.416
-Barley.
-Yes.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.416
That's barley field.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.750
-Oh, I see.
-Barley.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.958
-With the wind blowing.
-Yes.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.083
As for me,

17:51.583 --> 17:54.000
I don't have the looks to be on the field,

17:54.083 --> 17:55.541
so I shot my ad in Itaewon.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.666
-Anyway, it's barley.
-Right.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.791
Not just any barley, though.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.625
Otherwise, it'd just be barley tea.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.166
You let the barley sprout by watering it.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.583
As it sprouts,
the barley's properties change.

18:10.416 --> 18:13.000
It starts creating
nutrition for germination.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.958
That's when you stop the growth.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.208
You take that,

18:19.291 --> 18:21.916
dry and roast it.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.125
That's called malt.

18:24.666 --> 18:27.208
After roasting, you mash it.

18:27.708 --> 18:30.916
Then pour hot water over it.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.083
The technical term is "saccharification."

18:34.208 --> 18:37.000
It means the product turns sweet.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.125
You make beer with that.

18:39.833 --> 18:42.208
But when we drink beer,
we taste the bitterness.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.291
Yes.

18:44.375 --> 18:45.916
That's called hop.

18:47.208 --> 18:51.041
The hop's role is to bring the bitterness,

18:51.125 --> 18:52.833
and most importantly, keep the foam.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.791
Wow, it keeps the foam?

18:56.083 --> 19:01.250
And then what's most important
in alcohol-making is the yeast.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.083
You need the bacteria
for the alcohol to boil…

19:04.166 --> 19:05.708
-Yes.
-…and ferment.

19:05.791 --> 19:07.500
The yeast moves around,

19:07.583 --> 19:12.541
eats the sweet stuff
and spits out alcohol and carbonation.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.416
MALT, WATER

19:25.333 --> 19:28.416
SACCHARIFICATION

19:40.458 --> 19:43.125
ADD HOP

19:45.458 --> 19:48.083
BOIL

19:54.666 --> 19:57.208
ADD YEAST

19:58.375 --> 20:01.291
FERMENT

20:04.208 --> 20:05.583
AGE

20:19.916 --> 20:24.083
The yeast plays a big role
in deciding whether to make an ale

20:25.125 --> 20:26.458
or a lager.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.208
That's an important role.

20:29.291 --> 20:32.375
People living in the North Pole
are used to moving in the cold

20:32.458 --> 20:34.875
and people in Africa
are used to moving in the heat.

20:34.958 --> 20:36.875
Similarly, yeast has distinct properties.

20:36.958 --> 20:40.458
The yeast that gets activated
in a higher room temperature.

20:40.958 --> 20:44.291
If you add yeast that is activated
at 15 to 25 degrees Celsius,

20:44.375 --> 20:45.541
it becomes an ale.

20:48.416 --> 20:52.208
If you add yeast that is activated
at 5 to 12 degrees Celsius,

20:52.291 --> 20:53.458
it becomes a lager.

20:54.625 --> 20:55.833
The colder one…

20:56.333 --> 20:58.500
-If it moves in the cold, lager.
-…is a lager.

20:58.583 --> 21:02.083
-If it moves in the heat, ale.
-Ale.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.083
Why the names--

21:03.166 --> 21:06.083
What we typically drink here is all lager.

21:06.875 --> 21:10.083
About 80-90% of the beer
are probably lager.

21:10.166 --> 21:14.250
For Korea, the main lagers are

21:14.791 --> 21:17.625
Cass, Terra, the usual ones.

21:17.708 --> 21:18.750
Budweiser.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.375
-Heineken is lager, too.
-Heineken.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.291
Lager.

21:22.208 --> 21:25.208
For ales, apart from the microbreweries,

21:25.291 --> 21:26.541
we have Hoegaarden.

21:26.625 --> 21:29.208
-Hoegaarden.
-Guinness, Hoegaarden.

21:29.791 --> 21:30.875
Korean labels…

21:30.958 --> 21:33.875
I get what's different between the two.

21:35.375 --> 21:39.708
So, in other words,
they are made using different methods.

21:39.791 --> 21:43.666
In kimchi terms,
it's like kimchi-guk and kimchi-jjigae.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.750
-They taste completely different.
-They're cooked differently.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.041
-Like you said.
-Yes.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.333
KIMCHI-GUK

21:54.333 --> 21:56.416
KIMCHI-JJIGAE

21:58.208 --> 22:00.291
KIMCHI

22:08.375 --> 22:10.458
LAGER, ALE

22:16.625 --> 22:20.375
BARLEY

22:21.458 --> 22:23.208
What do you prefer?

22:23.291 --> 22:25.083
Stronger beer or milder ones?

22:25.166 --> 22:26.208
I like lager.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.958
-You like that gulp.
-Lager.

22:28.041 --> 22:31.833
-I learned something today, lager.
-Lager pairs well with munchies.

22:32.375 --> 22:34.583
I can teach my friends now.

22:34.666 --> 22:36.041
A lot of people don't know.

22:36.541 --> 22:38.958
Absolutely.
Not a lot of people would know that.

22:42.708 --> 22:43.708
Lager.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.250
-Isn't it challenging?
-What?

22:50.333 --> 22:51.916
You do a lot of work.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.208
Thankfully, I like what I do.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.666
Is volleyball hard?

22:58.750 --> 22:59.916
It's hard.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.250
Oh, is it?

23:07.041 --> 23:08.208
It's physically taxing.

23:09.333 --> 23:11.291
It's fun, but also difficult.

23:11.916 --> 23:15.916
Because we always have to
overcome a threshold.

23:16.000 --> 23:16.916
That must be why.

23:17.458 --> 23:19.500
Athletes also say this.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.458
When you have sore muscles or feel tired.

23:23.541 --> 23:25.000
-Knots in your muscles.
-Yeah.

23:25.083 --> 23:28.375
Some say drinking a beer
before bed helps with that.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.625
Because your muscles unwind.

23:42.625 --> 23:45.250
BEER THERAPY

23:45.333 --> 23:47.541
I have a bit of a knot now, too.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.791
-So if I drink this…
-I see.

23:49.875 --> 23:51.333
-…I'll be better.
-Me too, my arm.

23:51.416 --> 23:52.750
This arm feels better now.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.041
My arm is sore from learning tennis.

23:56.125 --> 23:57.416
You play tennis?

24:02.083 --> 24:03.708
I've learned tennis before, too.

24:03.791 --> 24:04.666
Yeah?

24:04.750 --> 24:05.666
Isn't tennis fun?

24:05.750 --> 24:07.291
-It's active.
-It's kinda fun.

24:07.375 --> 24:08.500
-Good sweat.
-At first,

24:08.583 --> 24:12.250
I was panting after five minutes.
That's when you crave beer.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.500
I'll eat this one.

24:25.583 --> 24:26.625
Go ahead.

24:27.125 --> 24:29.375
It's at an ambiguous part.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.083
It's not quite dry meat.

24:31.166 --> 24:32.000
Right.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.083
-Eat this, too.
-Nah.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.583
You really like this.

24:47.666 --> 24:48.541
-Me?
-Yeah.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.041
I love things like this.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.208
I have to have danmuji with jjajangmyeon.

24:52.750 --> 24:55.916
With this, I need mu, pickled radish.
Must have mu with chicken.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.875
I can't eat without it.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.375
Do you tend to ask
for mumani with your chicken?

25:02.458 --> 25:03.416
Yes, extra mu.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.291
-That's how you order.
-Yes.

25:06.291 --> 25:08.083
Always mumani.

25:13.375 --> 25:15.250
We need to order something else.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.500
-Of course.
-Yeah.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.250
-Sir, can we get fried chicken?
-Fried chicken?

25:21.333 --> 25:23.416
-Banban-Mumani.
-Half & half.

25:23.500 --> 25:24.458
-And mu.
-Mumani!

25:24.541 --> 25:26.250
-Banban-Mumani.
-Extra mu.

25:27.458 --> 25:33.250
BANBAN-MUMANI

26:52.125 --> 26:53.500
-Thank you.
-Here's the chicken.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.166
Thank you.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.166
Thank you.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.666
-Thanks.
-Yup.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.041
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

27:01.125 --> 27:02.416
-Go ahead.
-It's hot.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.875
-Yes.
-Dig in.

27:03.958 --> 27:04.791
Plain for me.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.291
Seasoned for me.

27:34.833 --> 27:37.000
Their chicken is good.

27:39.583 --> 27:43.375
It's like the old-style plain
and seasoned fried chicken.

27:44.041 --> 27:47.041
I do like the old style chicken.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.250
When I crave the old style,
I go for Mexicana or Pelicana.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.333
-Pelicana.
-Yes, that style.

27:58.500 --> 27:59.416
It's good.

28:06.208 --> 28:08.458
Which do you like better?
Plain or seasoned?

28:09.833 --> 28:11.000
I like it plain.

28:11.083 --> 28:12.416
You like it plain?

28:14.583 --> 28:16.916
You like the original flavor.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.458
You can eat more that way.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.125
I save the seasoned one
for the last piece.

28:30.791 --> 28:32.333
-The seasoning is good.
-Yes.

28:35.958 --> 28:37.416
Their seasoning is good, too.

28:38.375 --> 28:39.875
Theirs is spicy.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.000
It looks like they put gochujang in it.

28:44.541 --> 28:47.125
I thought you liked things spicy.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.000
Strong flavors.

28:49.083 --> 28:51.041
Why does everyone think that?

28:51.791 --> 28:52.625
It's true.

28:53.916 --> 28:56.541
Because you crave provocative flavors.

28:57.625 --> 28:59.750
You can't help but eat it again.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.791
Do you like chimaek?

29:05.875 --> 29:06.958
I do.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.291
Chicken and beer pair well.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.666
-A perfect pair.
-So good.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.250
You need to pair this greasy fried food
with something carbonated.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.458
And what's a better carbonated drink
than beer?

29:17.541 --> 29:21.000
It's something you can drink casually.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.125
You get home after work.

29:23.208 --> 29:25.416
You order fried chicken in advance.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.416
The chicken arrives just as you get home.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.791
You take the beer out of the fridge.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.291
Pop it open and gulp it down.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.166
I love that feeling.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.500
That's why I like drinking at home.

29:36.583 --> 29:38.208
-Which means beer's always ready.
-Yes.

29:38.291 --> 29:40.375
-Icy cold at home.
-Of course.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.708
It's always ready in my fridge.

29:42.791 --> 29:43.666
All ready.

29:46.458 --> 29:50.041
"Chimaek" is a recent term.

29:50.125 --> 29:51.791
Coined during the 2002 World Cup?

29:52.625 --> 29:54.291
In 2002, I was in middle school.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.333
Yeah? Then you wouldn't know.

29:56.416 --> 29:58.333
-You shouldn't know at that age.
-Yes.

29:58.416 --> 29:59.333
In middle school.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.291
During the 2002 FIFA World Cup,

30:02.875 --> 30:04.500
chimaek, chicken and beer

30:05.000 --> 30:06.708
became a sensation.

30:07.666 --> 30:10.958
That's when fried chicken stores
started proliferating.

30:12.125 --> 30:13.666
You know KFC?

30:13.750 --> 30:14.916
-Yes.
-KFC.

30:15.583 --> 30:17.125
A global franchise.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.041
Yes.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.875
They have about 25,000 stores worldwide.

30:21.791 --> 30:22.958
It's ginormous.

30:23.041 --> 30:26.166
But in Korea,
we have 87,000 chicken stores.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.000
-Really?
-Yes.

30:29.041 --> 30:31.791
Statistics say in Korea

30:32.666 --> 30:35.375
a person eats 16kg of chicken per year.

30:36.416 --> 30:38.041
You can't stop eating it.

30:38.708 --> 30:40.333
They love this overseas, too.

30:40.416 --> 30:42.625
-Korean chicken.
-Yeah, it's popular.

30:43.125 --> 30:45.708
There's a funny saying in other countries.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.625
You know KFC
stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

30:48.708 --> 30:49.541
Right.

30:49.625 --> 30:52.250
But foreign YouTubers call KFC

30:52.916 --> 30:54.333
Korean Fried Chicken.

31:17.583 --> 31:21.416
Even the foreigners
who can't eat other Korean food

31:21.500 --> 31:24.333
-like Korean fried chicken by default.
-This, they like.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.916
It's a given.

31:27.416 --> 31:28.541
It's amazing.

31:29.208 --> 31:30.208
You're right.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.833
Usually,
do you prefer bottled or draft beer?

31:42.916 --> 31:44.208
-Me?
-Yes.

31:44.291 --> 31:46.125
I like draft beer a lot.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.291
-Draft beer?
-Yes.

31:48.291 --> 31:53.583
Do you know the difference
between draft, bottled, and canned beer?

31:54.750 --> 31:56.541
DRAFT BEER

31:57.333 --> 31:59.083
BOTTLED BEER

31:59.958 --> 32:01.708
CANNED BEER

32:02.291 --> 32:03.291
The difference?

32:04.166 --> 32:05.583
What kind of a difference?

32:06.083 --> 32:08.000
-What kind?
-Tell me what you know.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.041
-If that's too hard…
-Yes.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.958
What's the difference
between bottled and draft beer?

32:15.875 --> 32:17.083
-The difference…
-Yes.

32:17.583 --> 32:18.500
…is in the foam.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.166
-Foam?
-Yes.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.375
And there's this freshness

32:24.000 --> 32:25.375
of a freshly drafted beer.

32:26.416 --> 32:28.000
-Freshness?
-Freshness.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.000
No? Something deeper than that?

32:32.083 --> 32:34.083
No, that's more than enough.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.666
-A layman's perspective.
-Yes.

32:37.750 --> 32:40.583
You bottle the beer as it's fermenting.

32:40.666 --> 32:42.375
In the beginning, long ago.

32:42.875 --> 32:45.916
The fermentation would continue
during the distribution.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.500
So it would burst in the middle
and cause problems.

32:48.583 --> 32:51.708
So they decided to halt the fermentation.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.083
-It's called pasteurization.
-I see.

32:55.166 --> 32:57.250
If you leave it below 60 degrees Celsius,

32:57.333 --> 32:59.166
the ferment bacteria would die.

33:00.083 --> 33:04.083
The problem is pasteurizing in a bottle

33:04.750 --> 33:07.166
and pasteurizing in a big barrel

33:07.250 --> 33:09.583
have different levels of pasteurization.

33:09.666 --> 33:12.416
It might be pasteurized here,
but not here.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.875
-Barrels are bigger.
-Right.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.750
So when you'd drink it,

33:15.833 --> 33:17.541
-it would taste different.
-I see.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.416
That's how draft beer got popular.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.416
"Fresh" beer.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.333
It's fresh.

33:22.916 --> 33:26.791
Pasteurizing tends to make beer taste bad.

33:27.458 --> 33:28.916
-Freshness is gone.
-Right.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.625
So the new method
was to filter the finished beer

33:32.708 --> 33:34.250
using a very fine net.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.125
By using this net,

33:36.208 --> 33:38.375
they block the yeast
from entering the beer.

33:39.125 --> 33:42.708
And then they either fill it in
either a bottle or a can.

33:42.791 --> 33:43.666
These days.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.750
Draft beer these days…

34:34.833 --> 34:37.208
This won't be great news for draft lovers.

34:37.916 --> 34:39.041
But it's all the same.

34:40.333 --> 34:41.458
Just different containers.

34:42.041 --> 34:43.416
But it tastes different.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.125
-It feels different.
-Really?

34:46.750 --> 34:48.916
Shall we compare it with a bottle then?

34:50.666 --> 34:51.541
Excuse me.

34:51.625 --> 34:53.041
Two 500cc

34:53.541 --> 34:55.458
and a Cass, please. Two glasses, too.

35:05.916 --> 35:06.750
Thank you.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.291
This is gonna be interesting.

35:17.375 --> 35:18.666
Thank you.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.416
Try a sip of this first
and compare with the draft.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.333
Okay.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.083
It's different.

35:35.375 --> 35:36.958
This is different.

35:41.291 --> 35:43.333
-Why's that?
-It just is.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.000
It's different.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.458
It's the same.

36:06.958 --> 36:08.500
It's the same? Are you sure?

36:17.333 --> 36:19.041
Now it's beginning to taste the same.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.708
After you pour it
and it stays in my mouth.

36:21.791 --> 36:24.208
Once it's been in my mouth for a bit,
it changes.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.583
It's the same.

36:31.750 --> 36:33.083
But it feels different.

36:33.958 --> 36:34.791
Draft beer.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.875
The feeling comes from the glass.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.916
We are like that. Even when you eat rice.

36:41.416 --> 36:44.166
Eating it in a rice bowl and a soup bowl…

36:44.250 --> 36:45.541
-Yes.
-…feels different.

36:45.625 --> 36:46.833
-It feels different.
-Yeah.

36:46.916 --> 36:48.291
It's like that.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.291
-It's better in this glass.
-Draft beer?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.750
I see.

36:52.375 --> 36:53.708
It's better in this glass.

36:56.375 --> 36:57.666
More munchies?

36:58.208 --> 37:00.750
-What do you like?
-Everything, really.

37:01.916 --> 37:03.500
-Can we see the menu?
-Yes.

37:08.291 --> 37:09.833
-Thank you.
-Sure.

37:09.916 --> 37:11.625
-Choose something.
-Okay.

37:14.291 --> 37:15.875
Tteokbokki or dubu kimchi.

37:15.958 --> 37:18.500
Do you like these
or do you prefer dry munchies?

37:18.583 --> 37:19.583
I don't mind either.

37:21.541 --> 37:24.083
What kind? Order what you like.

37:24.166 --> 37:26.125
I already ordered two of my favorites.

37:26.625 --> 37:28.250
I'm getting full.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.791
I do want the tteokbokki.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.916
I saw them bring it out earlier.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.208
Do you like tteokbokki?

37:33.291 --> 37:35.000
Tteokbokki is good.

37:35.583 --> 37:38.583
That or dubu kimchi looked delicious, too.

37:38.666 --> 37:39.541
You must like dubu.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.833
There's dubu kimchi over there.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.666
-Dubu kimchi.
-Let's get dubu kimchi then.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.708
Okay, dubu kimchi it is.

37:48.791 --> 37:49.791
Excuse me.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.333
-Can we get dubu kimchi?
-Dubu kimchi.

37:52.416 --> 37:53.416
-Yes, one.
-Yes.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.458
-Yes.
-Thank you.

37:54.541 --> 37:55.791
Thank you.

37:57.291 --> 38:00.041
You like having it your way.

38:00.666 --> 38:01.500
Nah.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.458
I said seafood tteokbokki

38:04.541 --> 38:05.458
or dubu kimchi.

38:05.541 --> 38:08.666
-Then you order dubu kimchi.
-I was trying to help you decide.

38:08.750 --> 38:11.250
Thank you. Dubu kimchi? Okay.

38:21.291 --> 38:23.416
DUBU KIMCHI

38:58.041 --> 39:00.000
-Thank you.
-Yes.

39:01.666 --> 39:02.500
Thank you.

39:02.583 --> 39:03.583
-Here you go.
-Yes.

39:04.791 --> 39:05.791
Chopsticks.

39:17.875 --> 39:18.875
How is it?

39:21.250 --> 39:23.166
You gotta go with the popular choice.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.250
It's good.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.750
Earlier you said you wanted this.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.041
-So I went with this instead.
-Good job.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.708
It's good.
Popular choice is the right choice.

39:42.166 --> 39:43.083
Aren't you full?

39:43.666 --> 39:44.666
This is nothing.

39:45.333 --> 39:46.416
Oh, yeah?

39:47.333 --> 39:48.500
Where do you live?

39:48.583 --> 39:50.875
I live in Yongin right now.

39:51.708 --> 39:55.875
Because our housing
and training facility are in Yongin.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.833
Now I'm with my old team--

39:57.916 --> 39:59.958
-Do you live with your parents?
-Alone.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.333
Don't you watch I Live Alone?

40:03.375 --> 40:04.666
I'm in that show.

40:05.291 --> 40:07.416
I've been living alone for ten plus years.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.541
What's with the laugh?

40:11.250 --> 40:13.125
-Do you feel sorry for me?
-No.

40:14.458 --> 40:17.000
-You should be alone at that age.
-You're just saying it.

40:17.083 --> 40:18.375
-I mean it.
-Really?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.083
Thank you.

40:21.125 --> 40:23.458
If you know a good person,
do introduce me.

40:23.541 --> 40:24.625
If you do…

40:25.666 --> 40:27.708
As you know, I'm old.

40:29.041 --> 40:30.750
Nice people around me are…

40:33.875 --> 40:36.041
-Dubu kimchi is good.
-It is.

40:36.541 --> 40:38.333
It was a solid choice.

40:44.666 --> 40:46.583
When you are overseas,

40:47.083 --> 40:48.416
do you crave dubu kimchi?

40:48.500 --> 40:50.541
I do crave dubu kimchi.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.416
You can't find that dish overseas.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.625
-Dubu kimchi…
-It's hard to find dubu.

40:54.708 --> 40:57.583
Dubu matters
but it's the kimchi that's important.

40:57.666 --> 40:59.583
-Kimchi.
-It's gotta be well fermented.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.291
I need to bring my mom's kimchi.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.083
I bring my mom's kimchi with me.

41:07.750 --> 41:11.291
When you are overseas,
is food the most challenging part?

41:11.916 --> 41:13.916
Yeah, food is definitely one of them.

41:14.541 --> 41:16.000
It's challenging.

41:16.541 --> 41:20.333
Some of the most recent issues
includes racial discrimination.

41:20.416 --> 41:21.916
-Right.
-It's been a big issue.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.375
-But you are a sports star.
-Right.

41:24.458 --> 41:26.583
And you still feel that way?

41:26.666 --> 41:27.833
Well,

41:27.916 --> 41:28.750
you see,

41:30.041 --> 41:32.250
they don't do it in my face.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.791
But they'd pull their eyes to the sides.

41:34.875 --> 41:36.500
-Right.
-That kind of behavior.

41:36.583 --> 41:39.875
Those behaviors can be upsetting.

41:39.958 --> 41:44.375
Once, after preliminaries,
a coach won the game

41:44.458 --> 41:48.708
and did that eye-pulling gesture
in front of a camera.

41:48.791 --> 41:50.000
Former Russian coach.

41:50.083 --> 41:52.041
-Russian coach.
-Right?

41:52.125 --> 41:53.791
-Yeah?
-After winning against me.

41:53.875 --> 41:56.291
-It was a big issue.
-Yes.

41:56.375 --> 41:57.916
I felt a bit…

41:58.000 --> 41:59.541
-Actually, I was very upset.
-Terrible.

41:59.625 --> 42:00.500
I was very upset.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.541
-From the person being attacked.
-Right.

42:03.708 --> 42:07.333
I've been through that a few times too.

42:07.416 --> 42:10.916
As I travel around the globe,

42:11.000 --> 42:11.833
sometimes

42:13.666 --> 42:15.625
I feel racial discrimination.

42:15.708 --> 42:16.541
Oh, really?

42:16.625 --> 42:19.166
I had many black friends
during my time overseas.

42:19.250 --> 42:24.208
And my black friends
would go through discrimination.

42:24.833 --> 42:30.375
But we are all the same.
We are all just people.

42:30.458 --> 42:36.666
To be discriminated against
because of appearance is very upsetting.

42:36.750 --> 42:41.083
My friends would post things
on their social media

42:41.166 --> 42:42.583
about racial discrimination.

42:42.666 --> 42:44.250
"Why do you treat us that way?"

42:44.333 --> 42:46.166
Then I would say something too.

42:46.250 --> 42:48.875
Once you get to know each other,
we are all the same.

42:48.958 --> 42:51.250
We are all just people.

42:51.333 --> 42:53.875
So that makes me upset from time to time.

42:53.958 --> 42:54.958
Those things.

42:55.708 --> 42:57.458
Because my friends go through that,

42:57.541 --> 42:59.916
I feel it even more.

43:00.625 --> 43:03.458
It is kind of foolish.

43:03.541 --> 43:04.375
In that sense.

43:04.458 --> 43:06.416
My concern

43:07.000 --> 43:10.458
is that racial and
other types of discrimination worldwide

43:10.541 --> 43:12.541
create animosity between races.

43:13.166 --> 43:14.958
-It's so foolish.
-Right.

43:15.041 --> 43:16.333
We are just different.

43:16.416 --> 43:18.583
It's a learning curve.

43:18.666 --> 43:22.041
-We learn from these situations.
-Right.

43:22.541 --> 43:23.375
I guess so.

44:21.166 --> 44:23.166
It's been a while, eating out like this.

44:23.250 --> 44:24.375
-It's nice.
-Right.

44:24.458 --> 44:26.458
These places are rare these days.

44:28.250 --> 44:29.666
It's so nice here.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.958
It's a shame. These draft beer houses.

44:33.458 --> 44:35.166
This culture should remain.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.208
Yes, of course.

44:38.125 --> 44:40.375
After this, we go for one more glass.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.458
-Yeon-koung.
-Yes.

45:12.041 --> 45:14.250
You've been on TV shows lately.

45:14.333 --> 45:15.166
Yes.

45:15.250 --> 45:16.250
Well…

45:17.458 --> 45:18.875
At first,

45:19.416 --> 45:21.833
it was fun and interesting.

45:21.916 --> 45:22.833
Same here.

45:22.916 --> 45:24.958
At first, it felt new.

45:25.041 --> 45:26.250
-Yes.
-It was fun.

45:26.333 --> 45:27.583
-Right.
-Also,

45:27.666 --> 45:30.291
you get to meet people you see on TV.

45:30.958 --> 45:32.458
So that was interesting.

45:32.541 --> 45:35.291
And then I felt a sense of responsibility.

45:36.041 --> 45:37.875
As a volleyball player.

45:38.416 --> 45:39.708
I felt it would be nice

45:40.666 --> 45:42.666
if volleyball became more popular.

45:42.750 --> 45:44.750
As the sense of responsibility piled up,

45:45.291 --> 45:47.375
it started weighing me down.

45:47.458 --> 45:49.666
Because I do it in between
my existing schedule.

45:49.750 --> 45:51.583
-I have volleyball.
-Right.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.458
I go on TV during my breaks.

45:55.416 --> 45:58.333
But even as I think that,

45:58.416 --> 46:02.041
I know that me being on TV

46:02.125 --> 46:05.000
has raised the awareness
on volleyball in Korea.

46:05.500 --> 46:08.166
I can feel that.

46:08.750 --> 46:11.041
So I think if I put in more effort,

46:11.541 --> 46:14.750
it would improve things even more.

46:15.583 --> 46:18.416
That's what keeps me going.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.166
I like that.
