13:51.843 --> 13:53.778
<i>I'm really sorry.
It's all right.</i>

13:53.845 --> 13:57.015
I don't know. He had
a blood clot in his calf.
Maybe he threw an embolus.

13:57.081 --> 14:00.018
He was fine in E.R.
As soon as we put him
in the elevator, he coded.

14:00.084 --> 14:02.654
Did he complain of any pain
or shortness of breath?

14:02.720 --> 14:06.824
Nothing. Evidently
He'd been going downhill
mentally for some time.

14:06.891 --> 14:09.994
- Has someone told his family?
- Yes, nurse Rosenthal.

14:10.061 --> 14:13.064
Oh, uh, Dr. Lepsinger's
the family physician.

14:13.131 --> 14:17.368
I just thought I'd wait
to reach him before filling
them in on the final details.

14:17.435 --> 14:20.004
- Okay. Well, I'll talk to them.
- Oh, you mind if I come?

14:20.071 --> 14:22.440
No, not at all.
I'll page you.

14:25.143 --> 14:27.512
Uh, think an Autopsy
would be helpful?

14:27.578 --> 14:31.316
Well, it would be nice.
I mean, he had enough
THINGS wrong with him.

14:31.382 --> 14:33.851
Besides, I'd like to see
if I missed something unusual.

14:33.918 --> 14:36.921
Like a little "T.R.O."
Tattooed on his heart, maybe?

14:36.988 --> 14:38.890
I'll see you later.

14:41.926 --> 14:44.028
[ sighs ]

14:47.966 --> 14:51.469
excuse me. Dr. Auschlander?
Can I ask you a quick question?

14:51.536 --> 14:54.072
You can ask me a long one
if you like.

14:54.138 --> 14:57.742
I've got a, uh--
I've got a patient,
Stan morgen.

14:57.809 --> 15:02.981
He's a 38-year-Old white male,
no serious illnesses
except for hepatitis "B,"

15:03.047 --> 15:05.416
which he had
about six months ago.

15:05.483 --> 15:09.554
We saw him once as an outpatient
and his liver Enzymes
were improving.

15:09.621 --> 15:13.057
Did you schedule a follow-up
to see if he still had
antigen positive?

15:13.124 --> 15:17.462
Yeah, but he didn't show up.
Now he's back
with terrific jaundice.

15:17.528 --> 15:20.031
What do you think he has?

15:20.098 --> 15:24.636
Well, his labs are
still pending, but I don't think
it's his gallbladder.

15:24.702 --> 15:27.238
Least not by my exam.

15:27.305 --> 15:30.541
What I'm wondering is
whether he's got
chronic active hepatitis...

15:30.608 --> 15:32.777
and whether we should
give him some steroids or--

15:32.844 --> 15:37.215
don't be in such a hurry.
Is he a drinker?

15:37.282 --> 15:39.217
I don't think so.
You know what I mean
by a drinker?

15:39.284 --> 15:42.253
Yeah, someone
who abuses alcohol.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.490
Someone who drinks
more than I do.

15:45.556 --> 15:48.660
Well, he's actually
a pretty straight guy, you know.

15:48.726 --> 15:50.728
He worked nights
to support his family.

15:50.795 --> 15:53.431
Well, he could have
chronic active hepatitis.

15:53.498 --> 15:57.035
But I wouldn't put him
on steroids until I had
a piece of Tissue to look at,

15:57.101 --> 15:59.037
and I'd wait for his labs
to come back...

15:59.103 --> 16:01.973
before I'd go
rushing into his room
with a big biopsy Needle.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.676
That's what I wanted to know.

16:04.742 --> 16:06.644
Thanks a lot.
Any time.

16:08.179 --> 16:11.783
<i>How old did you say
this fellow was?
Thirty-Eight.</i>

16:11.849 --> 16:14.986
Shame. Shame.

16:18.589 --> 16:22.994
<i>So you began your work
on valve replacements
before you got to budapest.</i>

16:23.061 --> 16:27.098
Oh, yes. In debrecen.
The hospital is very good.
Oh.

16:27.165 --> 16:31.002
But now I'm chief
of cardiac surgery,
so I must go to budapest.

16:31.069 --> 16:33.004
Uh-Huh.
Then in four years,
there is a new chief...

16:33.071 --> 16:34.973
So, uh, I can go back.

16:37.575 --> 16:41.512
It must be terrible living
in a police state, where
they dictate your every move.

16:41.579 --> 16:44.248
Oh, it's not so bad.
You know, when you're,
uh, chief,

16:44.315 --> 16:47.251
you can take a trip like this,
you can do research.

16:47.318 --> 16:50.121
Even so.
Are you still
interested in research?

16:50.188 --> 16:52.724
Interested, of course,
but I'm busy here.

16:52.790 --> 16:57.662
I still maintain an affiliation
with the lab at medical school,
but I don't have any time.

16:57.729 --> 17:02.133
Oh, that's too bad.
I very much enjoyed your work
on congenital heart disease.

17:03.434 --> 17:05.369
My God.
Did you read that?

17:05.435 --> 17:08.239
Yes, of course.
It was, uh, suggested reading
during my training.

17:08.306 --> 17:10.308

17:10.375 --> 17:13.411

18:06.731 --> 18:10.234
No.
Not as far as I know.

He never was...
much for drinking.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.612
Oh, no.
That's not him at all.

18:23.214 --> 18:27.518
I've never even seen him
smoke a cigarette.
No, I didn't think so.

18:29.787 --> 18:33.257
His liver's real bad,
isn't it?

18:35.026 --> 18:38.563
Well, I'm not sure yet.
It could be.

18:38.630 --> 18:41.265
Well, you know,

18:41.332 --> 18:46.738
it says in here that if
you put clay on your skin,

18:46.804 --> 18:50.508
it helps to soak up
the poisons from the body,

18:50.575 --> 18:54.078
which makes it easier
on the liver.

18:54.145 --> 18:59.651

I guess that's all
a bunch of... junk.

18:59.717 --> 19:02.854
Well, unless they know
more than we do.
Oh, no.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.890
No, I know you're all

is good enough for me.

You can buy a car,
but it's extremely expensive.

the government
will give you a car.

just seems strange though,
in an elevator.

20:59.771 --> 21:04.175
Take it from me.
Anything can happen
in an elevator. Anything.

21:04.242 --> 21:07.145
What are you, bragging?
Nope. Just quoting
a study I did.

21:11.783 --> 21:17.188
You see, in the United States,
doctors are very, uh--

21:17.255 --> 21:20.792
you know, um--
big, important.

21:20.858 --> 21:23.895
In hungary,
doctors are not so important.

21:23.962 --> 21:28.733
[ Mouthing words ]
scientists, oh,
they are important.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.637
So my husband, who was
a chemical engineer,
he got a car.

21:32.704 --> 21:35.006
Uh, he was only 23,
very young.

21:35.073 --> 21:38.743
That is very impressive.
You know, to have a car
when you're 23,

21:38.810 --> 21:43.281
you are like a, um--
a big shot, you know?

21:43.348 --> 21:47.251
Is that why
you went out with him?
Oh, well, of course.

21:47.318 --> 21:50.421
You cannot go anywhere
without a car.

21:50.488 --> 21:52.957
[ chuckles ]
so you're still driving
the same car?

21:53.024 --> 21:55.493
Oh, no, no.

21:55.560 --> 22:00.231
But they do insist that
you drive the car until, um,

22:00.298 --> 22:02.433
it falls apart.

22:02.500 --> 22:06.871
Same with our residents.
And that's because they
can't afford to buy a new one.

22:06.938 --> 22:11.209
That's right. In America,
you work for everything you get.

22:11.275 --> 22:13.177
You're very tough.

22:15.346 --> 22:18.449

22:18.516 --> 22:21.386
The only problem
with Being on call

half the interesting cases.

25:11.956 --> 25:16.861
Well, um-- nothing unusual.
He... just became unresponsive.

as a complete arrest.

both his heart and lungs
stopped functioning.

Oh, I see.
Is that very painful?

25:27.372 --> 25:33.277
No, uh, what happens is that
the blood supply to the brain
is suddenly cut off.

25:33.344 --> 25:36.681
There's really
no feeling at all.
Oh, I'm glad of that.

25:36.748 --> 25:40.718

something like that?

<i>[ Westphall ]

I'm a little disappointed.

we could do an annuloplasty
instead of replacing the valve.

so much destruction.

drink himself to death,

his outlook would change...

someplace other than his liver?

tried talking to him.

Yeah, I don't think
he's feelin' too hot
about doctors right now.

37:41.572 --> 37:46.411

nice, youthful head of hair.

that they, uh, brought in
an outside pathologist.

They want the body transferred
for examination,

and I, uh, tried to contact them
to find out
what the problem was.

38:51.376 --> 38:54.245
I finally reached the son,
and he told me that, uh,

38:54.312 --> 38:57.348
their family attorney
had advised them
to pursue legal action.

to do is Write down

met Mr. Runneger
until he expired.

And, uh, don't duplicate
what's on the chart.
We have a copy of that.

about the patient
but, uh, didn't write down.

39:25.143 --> 39:29.380

have been going on around you

said to another physician
or, uh-- or the family.

39:34.419 --> 39:36.788
<i>That kind of thing,
you know.</i>

39:36.854 --> 39:38.856
How specific
do you want me to be?

39:38.923 --> 39:42.527
As specific as possible.
If you remember the time
you said something,

39:42.593 --> 39:46.297
or somebody was, uh-- Somebody
was wearing something unusual,
just write it down.

39:46.364 --> 39:50.535
Put it all... in there.
All right?
We have any questions?

39:52.770 --> 39:55.707
- No.
- Okay.

39:55.773 --> 39:58.409
Now I know this may be
frightening to you, but, uh--

39:58.476 --> 40:02.313
Well, there's no need
to be frightened, at least
not till I tell you to be.

40:02.380 --> 40:06.851
It may sound strange,
but, uh, actually I think
you're lucky in a way,

40:06.918 --> 40:11.155
because you're gonna have
an experience that every doctor
in training ought to have.

40:11.222 --> 40:14.425
Because the way
things are today,
sooner or later,

40:14.492 --> 40:18.429
whether they--
whether they like it or not,

40:18.496 --> 40:20.398
every doctor's
gonna go through this.

40:21.566 --> 40:23.501
You know, in the good old days,

40:23.568 --> 40:27.138
when medicine was
a gentlemanly profession,
people didn't Sue their doctor.

40:27.205 --> 40:29.507
Nowadays, they're awarding
all these huge judgments.

40:29.574 --> 40:33.111
- The, uh--
the legal climate is--
- Fertile.

40:35.346 --> 40:37.515
There's a word for you.

40:38.883 --> 40:42.453
So, no matter what happens
with this whole thing,

40:42.520 --> 40:46.858
<i>you just pay attention,
'cause you won't find it
in any book.</i>

40:49.260 --> 40:51.162
I'll be in touch.

40:53.331 --> 40:55.800
Oh, here.
Let me get that for you.

40:55.867 --> 40:57.769
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

41:00.505 --> 41:03.975
Dr. Chandler, let my office know
when you'll be available.

41:05.510 --> 41:08.012
Next time,
you do all the talking.

41:08.079 --> 41:09.981
<i>[ Westphall ]
thank you, Sam.</i>

41:15.420 --> 41:17.889
He's something, isn't he?

41:19.824 --> 41:23.728
Yeah, I'll say, um--
What happened to his legs?

41:23.795 --> 41:27.432
<i>I don't really know.
I think it was a car accident
when he was young.</i>

41:27.498 --> 41:30.935
But believe me,
I've seen him in court.
He needs nobody's sympathy.

41:31.002 --> 41:33.771
Yeah, well,
I'm glad he's on our side.

41:35.573 --> 41:39.310
You know, the family
seemed so reasonable
when we talked to them.

41:39.377 --> 41:42.880
Yeah, I thought so too.
But I guess when people
are about to Sue you,

41:42.947 --> 41:44.882
they don't telegraph
their punches, right?

41:44.949 --> 41:46.884
Yeah, but they knew
he was sick.

41:46.951 --> 41:50.989
Yeah, they knew it
after he died. But I think
you'd be surprised, Phil.

41:51.055 --> 41:53.791
Sometimes the people who are
closest to a situation...

41:53.858 --> 41:55.860
have the least amount
of insight into it.

41:55.927 --> 41:59.530
Especially when it means
they're gonna have to recognize
something they don't wanna see.

42:00.798 --> 42:03.334
I don't-- I never expected
anything like this.

42:03.401 --> 42:06.337
I don't think we ever do.

42:06.404 --> 42:09.207
<i>â™ªâ™ª [ Piano ]</i>

42:11.676 --> 42:15.213
<i>excusez-Moi, doctor.
Will there be anything else?</i>

42:15.279 --> 42:17.949
[ Indistinct ]

42:18.016 --> 42:19.951
coffee?
No, please.

42:20.018 --> 42:22.887
More wine?
No.
[ Laughs ]

42:22.954 --> 42:26.457
uh, no, thanks.
[ speaking French ]
[ French ]

42:30.094 --> 42:33.598
you sure
you don't want more?
Mmm. No, Really.

42:33.665 --> 42:36.367
Really.
I'm going to get drunk.

42:36.434 --> 42:39.103
That's not very good
for a visiting surgeon.

42:39.170 --> 42:42.340
Listen, I know a surgeon who did
his best work when he was drunk.

42:42.407 --> 42:44.342
Oh?
That's the truth.

42:44.409 --> 42:47.478
Ed tinsdale, one of
my father's contemporaries,

42:47.545 --> 42:51.983
could do the most
beautiful gallbladder
completely inebriated.

42:54.152 --> 42:56.387
I'll never forget it.
It was one Sunday.

42:56.454 --> 43:00.525
My father and I had just
come back from fishing.
I was home from medical school.

43:00.591 --> 43:04.529
And the hospital called
to notify him of an emergency.

43:04.595 --> 43:08.566
And at that, my dad cut himself
with the fishing knife.

43:08.633 --> 43:10.802
Careful of your hand.
Oh, yes.

43:10.868 --> 43:14.105
Anyway, h-He said,
"Well, let's call Dr. Tinsdale."

43:15.606 --> 43:17.542
So I went to see the surgery,

43:17.608 --> 43:22.146
and when tinsdale walked
into the operating room,
he smelled like a brewery.

43:22.213 --> 43:26.150
[ laughing ]
I mean, there was
no doubt about it. He was drunk.

43:26.217 --> 43:31.489
And he proceeded to do
the cleanest cholecystectomy
that I have ever seen.

43:31.556 --> 43:35.727
Oh.
And afterwards,
the anesthesiologist said...

43:35.793 --> 43:38.029
that this is the first case
he's ever had...

43:38.096 --> 43:40.898
where the surgeon was more
anesthetized than the patient.

43:43.835 --> 43:47.071
[ French ]
Yeah. You know, funny thing
about ed tinsdale.

43:47.138 --> 43:50.975
He went downhill after that.
Okay. Thank you.

43:52.043 --> 43:53.978
Thank you.
Oh, listen.

43:54.045 --> 43:57.015
That was very nice of you.
My pleasure. Really.

43:57.081 --> 43:59.183
[ Muttering ]

43:59.250 --> 44:04.555
[ Chuckles ]
uh-- Oh, what the hell.

44:04.622 --> 44:10.328
Listen, do you mind
if we stop by at the hospital
before we get back?

44:10.395 --> 44:13.564
I have some notes that
I wanna check for
tomorrow morning's conference.

44:13.631 --> 44:15.566
No, no. Of course not.

44:15.633 --> 44:20.038
Well, perhaps we're drunk enough
to remove Someone's gallbladder.

44:22.140 --> 44:24.609
All right. Why not?
[ Laughs ]
good night.

44:41.559 --> 44:44.028
<i>Mr. Morgen?
Yeah?</i>

44:44.095 --> 44:47.899
I'm Dr. Auschlander.
I'm a liver specialist.
That so?

44:47.966 --> 44:51.736
I was talking to Dr. Morrison
earlier today. Told me about all
the drinking you've been doing.

44:51.803 --> 44:55.940
I don't need another doctor
Comin' in here and tellin' me
what to do with my life.

44:56.007 --> 45:00.144
I got a family I can't feed.
So don't come in here with your
fancy suit and your tie...

45:00.211 --> 45:02.513
and tell me
how I'm supposed to feel.

45:07.185 --> 45:09.621
Let me tell you something.

45:09.687 --> 45:15.326
Underneath this fancy suit
and tie and shirt,
there's a tube.

45:15.393 --> 45:18.162
One end of it
is stuck in my liver,

45:18.229 --> 45:20.898
where a cancer is eating its way
through my body.

45:20.965 --> 45:23.668
Now, the medicine I get
through this tube...

45:23.735 --> 45:27.572
has less than one chance in five
of helping me live longer.

45:27.639 --> 45:33.344
Makes me sick, nauseous
and susceptible to infection,
but I take it,

45:33.411 --> 45:35.780
and I'd take it if it was only
one chance in a thousand,

45:35.847 --> 45:37.749
because that's how precious
life is.

45:42.920 --> 45:47.992
Now, next year,
if I'm still around,

45:49.494 --> 45:51.929
I will have
been married 46 years.

45:51.996 --> 45:55.900
And it's absolutely True.
It does get better all the time.

45:55.967 --> 46:00.905
And I've had the chance to watch
my children grow into people
that I not only love,

46:01.939 --> 46:04.309
but also admire.

46:04.375 --> 46:07.912
And that's a feeling
you just can't put a price on.

46:11.182 --> 46:14.819
Now, I know I'm gonna die soon,
and there isn't anything
anyone can do about it.

46:16.854 --> 46:21.225
But... I'd give
everything I own...

46:21.292 --> 46:23.895
if I could have
just one more day,
one more minute...

46:25.229 --> 46:28.166
To enjoy everything
my family has meant to me.

46:30.935 --> 46:32.837
And that's why I know...

46:34.672 --> 46:37.608
that what you're
doing to yourself
is absolutely wrong.

46:41.245 --> 46:43.848
[ Sobbing ]

46:43.915 --> 46:46.417
Yeah, it's easy
for you to say.

46:46.484 --> 46:50.221
[ sighs ]
but I bet if you died
20 years ago,

46:52.991 --> 46:55.760
you'd have still lived
a better life
than I ever will.

46:55.827 --> 46:58.930
Life has dealt us both
a bad card.

47:00.865 --> 47:03.301
But you have many more
left in the deck.

47:04.936 --> 47:07.939
And it's only a fool
who wouldn't play out his hand.

47:21.386 --> 47:26.391
[ sighing ]
Oh, I'm so beat. I'm whipped.
They whipped me today.

47:26.457 --> 47:29.627
What are you waiting for?
Oberheimer's 10:00 labs.

47:29.694 --> 47:31.629
Well, can't you take them
over the phone?

47:31.696 --> 47:33.631
Not if they've been
operated on today.

47:33.698 --> 47:37.201
Herr Craig says,
"Ve must stay for the labs,
and ve must enjoy it."

47:37.268 --> 47:40.438
what must I have been
in my previous lifetime
to deserve this, huh?

47:40.505 --> 47:42.407
A heart surgeon.

47:43.941 --> 47:46.177
Gentlemen.

47:46.244 --> 47:49.013
Nice case today,
wasn't it, kochar?

47:49.080 --> 47:51.316
Uh, which one?

47:51.382 --> 47:54.385
What do you mean, which one?
Dr. Anya.

47:54.452 --> 47:57.622
Oh, yes, Yes.
Um-- Nice.

47:59.290 --> 48:02.694
Uh, very nice.
Um, excellent.

48:02.760 --> 48:06.431
Right, Excellent.
Ehrlich, you look ghastly.

48:06.497 --> 48:08.566
I wish you would take
better care of yourself.

48:08.633 --> 48:12.170
You'll have the hungarians
thinking I'm running some sort
of slave camp around here.

48:12.236 --> 48:15.006
Sleep a little extra
in the morning, okay?

48:15.073 --> 48:17.208
Dr. Anya and I
will do rounds.

48:17.275 --> 48:20.111
See you, 10:00,
foreign physicians' conference.

48:20.178 --> 48:22.080
Yes.
Ah.

48:24.182 --> 48:27.752
Let's not wait for the elevator.
It doesn't work for me.
Oh.

48:27.819 --> 48:29.787
We'll take the stairs.
All right.

48:33.124 --> 48:35.226
[ Scoffs ]
unbelievable.

48:35.293 --> 48:37.895
If only she would ask
for political asylum.

48:37.962 --> 48:40.598
[ both laughing ]

49:13.698 --> 49:14.899
[ mews ]
