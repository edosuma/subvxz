Maurice, I've got a little something
I want to say to the band.

We have no talent. [coughs] No talent.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.800
We were on the cusp of fame.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.679
But we were young in a rush,
and we blew up too fast.

[punk-rock music playing]

02:22.767 --> 02:24.227
They died?

Yeah. I just told you,
they blew up.

is maybe we should just

02:45.165 --> 02:47.292

11:06.457 --> 11:09.710
What happened to our sick tunes, son?

11:09.794 --> 11:14.215
The New Wiper Fluid just gave
you a tease of our new song.

11:14.298 --> 11:17.426
Like a tickle under the back
of your ear. But don't worry.

11:17.510 --> 11:21.430
We'll be back and bigger than ever at our
best concert of all times next week.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.433
We're gonna knock the socks
all the way to your faces.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.770
Free admission. Best show ever.
Sha-rock it. New Wiper Fluid out.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.438
[crowd cheering]

11:29.522 --> 11:33.401
Timo, you got to fix this! The peoples
can't survive without more of me.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.778
-[clears throat]
-Us. Whatever.

11:35.861 --> 11:40.574
I'm sorry, King Julien, but unless
Clover comes back, the band is finished.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.660
[both gasping]

11:44.078 --> 11:44.912
[grunts]

11:45.246 --> 11:46.080
Clover?

11:48.833 --> 11:49.667
Clover?

11:51.085 --> 11:54.839
-Clover! What is she doing, man?
-Looks pretty clear to me.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.717
She's gone rogue and is now performing
her own kind of experimental music.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.639
Oh, I can handle her.
Happy to do it, in fact. [chuckles]

12:04.432 --> 12:08.436
Careful. She could be sleep walking.
She'll lash out if you wake her up.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.938
I've seen it before with Dorothy. Oh.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.108
Ka-kaw! [groans deeply]

12:14.191 --> 12:18.779
What are you all doing here?
I am making music.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.115
[laughs]

12:21.532 --> 12:23.909
Clover. That is not music.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.580
Oh, and The New Wiper Fluid is? [laughs]

12:27.663 --> 12:30.791
All we do is stand there fake playing,

12:30.875 --> 12:35.754
while Timo's stupid music machine
turns our blargon into some sort of...

12:35.838 --> 12:39.967
[stammers] some sort of, I don't know,
worse blargon! [grunts]

12:40.634 --> 12:43.345
Maurice, what's she saying?
What language is that?

12:43.429 --> 12:46.223
I can't understand her.
What's wrong with her mind?

12:46.682 --> 12:49.685
My eyes have been opened, man.
You know, I just... I just play

12:49.768 --> 12:52.354
from the heart now. From the gut!

12:53.272 --> 12:58.360
Okay, just so I'm clear, you are
coming back to the band, right?

13:00.112 --> 13:01.197
[screams]

13:02.156 --> 13:05.951
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
She's not coming back.

13:06.035 --> 13:06.869
Hmm?

13:08.245 --> 13:09.788

13:10.831 --> 13:15.085

who can replace the voice of our former

name I will not mention.

13:18.797 --> 13:23.636

Your Majesty, do you remember
why we started this thing to begin with?

20:18.342 --> 20:21.261
Yeah. For the fans. Who hate us.

20:21.345 --> 20:25.015
No. We started the band
because we fell in love with our music.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.434
-With what we created together.
-Hmm.

20:28.143 --> 20:31.271
Then all of this stuff happened
and we went and wrecked it.

Clover, are you saying we don't need
Timo's stinking music machine

20:57.839 --> 21:01.134

the true music in our hearts?

21:01.218 --> 21:03.762

we are being true to ourselves,
