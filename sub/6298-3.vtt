CESARE: Catherina Sforza

ALEXANDER:
Give her a lesson in revenge.

00:22.113 --> 00:23.481
<i>CARDINAL SFORZA: There was</i>

So tell me, what must I do?
Confess.

without legitimacy.

00:37.506 --> 00:39.373
You are to negotiate
my dowry, Brother.

00:39.441 --> 00:41.209
If Naples dares to
take your son from you,

00:41.277 --> 00:42.744
it will never know
peace again.

00:42.812 --> 00:44.746
My betrothed will
not bed me.

My lady.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.124
Why am I here?

To learn to lie.
To say whatever's needed.

00:55.462 --> 00:57.832
Cardinal Francesco
Todeschini Piccolomini.

00:57.899 --> 01:00.736
Liar!
Cardinal Giovanni Battista Orsini.

01:00.803 --> 01:02.637
These are false
accusations coming from-

01:02.705 --> 01:05.038
Cardinal Rocca Colonna!
Julius Versucci!

01:05.105 --> 01:07.674
I have been party to
no conspiracy, Your Holiness!

01:07.742 --> 01:09.009
ALEXANDER:
Those cardinals

01:09.077 --> 01:11.211
will be stripped
of their offices and titles.

They will be forbidden entry

empty Consistory?

03:56.365 --> 03:57.732
An empty Consistory

03:57.800 --> 03:59.200
is at least free of
traitors and assassins.

03:59.301 --> 04:00.569
We will cleanse
our house

04:00.636 --> 04:02.871
and get rid
of this deceit

04:02.939 --> 04:06.375
with our own hands,
if that be God's will.

04:06.443 --> 04:08.478
And the fruits of
their degeneracy

No, no.
Not now.

A summary of the state
of the papal armies.

04:38.475 --> 04:40.911
This your work?

04:40.978 --> 04:43.247
The articles of war
demand the papal army

04:43.315 --> 04:44.448

04:44.516 --> 04:47.118
10,000 men-at-arms.
[grunts]

04:47.186 --> 04:49.954
You have less
than half that.

04:50.022 --> 04:54.592
Of horses, wagonry, and
transportation: six tenths.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.863
Of supplies, provisions,
medicines, foodstuffs

04:57.930 --> 05:00.532
and general equipment:
half.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.803
Half?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.881
[quiet murmuring]

05:15.949 --> 05:17.517
What good are
our men-at-arms

05:17.585 --> 05:20.920
if we can only equip them
with one sword between two?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.555
Are they supposed
to share?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.057
Well, what do you
expect me to do?

05:27.061 --> 05:28.629
What of your
cardinals' fortunes?

05:28.730 --> 05:30.632
There were debts.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.102
The treasury is filling,

05:32.169 --> 05:34.437
but not to the extent
of equipping an army.

05:34.538 --> 05:36.672
Well, we must find a way.

05:36.740 --> 05:39.275
Because Catherina Sforza
gathers allies to her daily

05:39.343 --> 05:41.277
like flies to a corpse.

05:41.378 --> 05:43.212
And we are weak.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.415
We are not yet
at war, Cesare.

05:45.483 --> 05:49.453
Father, we're already seeing the
first gambits on the chessboard:

05:49.554 --> 05:53.090
plot, intrigue,
assassination.

05:53.158 --> 05:56.994
But the endgame will be war,
and it will engulf all Italy.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.263
Am I wrong?

05:59.364 --> 06:00.732
No, you're not wrong.

06:00.799 --> 06:02.200
Then give me command!

06:02.268 --> 06:03.902
In time, Cesare.

ALEXANDER: You go to Naples
to discuss the terms

06:18.152 --> 06:19.986
of your sister's wedding, do you not?
Yes.

06:20.054 --> 06:22.088
When do you arrive?
Tomorrow.

06:24.424 --> 06:26.225
We offer Naples

06:26.292 --> 06:29.494
a chance to strengthen
our kinship with them

06:29.562 --> 06:32.296
in a bond of blood
and family.

06:32.363 --> 06:35.064
It is a joyous visit.

06:35.132 --> 06:37.500
But you might take
the opportunity

06:37.568 --> 06:41.571
to judge how our friends
and cousins in the south fare

06:41.638 --> 06:45.374
in terms of men,
arms, horses, wagonry,

06:45.442 --> 06:48.277
supplies, general equipment,
and the like.

06:48.344 --> 06:51.746
So that kinship may not be
the only thing strengthened

06:51.847 --> 06:54.382
by this joyous marriage.

06:54.450 --> 06:56.284
Is that smoke?

was the last person

or by design I can't tell.

I had you!
I think not.

08:29.714 --> 08:32.482

If this were for real -

08:32.549 --> 08:34.984

you'd be dead.

10:51.888 --> 10:53.388
It's difficult to know.

Harmony of households

10:57.461 --> 10:59.528

Vitelezzo Vitelli.

Naples.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.048

And, mindful of that honour,

12:43.185 --> 12:45.419
I should like to show
you around the city.

12:45.487 --> 12:49.121
Its beauties are modest
in comparison to Rome -

12:49.189 --> 12:51.590

it is my city, so...

12:51.658 --> 12:53.792
Impress me not with your

14:14.783 --> 14:16.281
We welcome you

14:16.349 --> 14:18.349
in the name of the fair
and ancient city of Naples.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.947
Rather more ancient than fair,
from what I've glimpsed.

14:21.047 --> 14:23.046
It seems the French army

14:23.113 --> 14:25.279
were not exactly
considerate tenants.

14:26.580 --> 14:29.045
Tonight we dine to
honour the union

14:29.146 --> 14:30.512
between our own Alfonso

14:30.579 --> 14:33.744
and the most-gracious
Lady Lucrezia.

14:33.812 --> 14:36.210
A union not only
of man and wife,

14:36.278 --> 14:37.743
but of Naples and Rome.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.342
We beg you,

14:39.410 --> 14:42.106
you will grace us
with your presence.

14:42.207 --> 14:43.973
I would be glad.

14:45.106 --> 14:46.571
<i>IL CEREMONIERE:</i>
<i>Presenting His Excellency,</i>

14:46.639 --> 14:48.904
<i>the Duke of Acquitane,</i>

14:48.972 --> 14:50.368
<i>Ambassador of the Court</i>

14:50.436 --> 14:53.766
<i>of his Highness</i>
<i>Louis XII of France.</i>

14:53.834 --> 14:56.197
We are honoured to receive
the Ambassador from France.

14:56.265 --> 14:59.464
And France is most deeply
honoured to be so received.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.997
Hm.

15:01.064 --> 15:06.829
Your new king, Louis the XII,
sends his ambassador.

15:06.897 --> 15:09.795
Tell me, does he bring
murmurings of peace or of war?

15:09.896 --> 15:11.627
Peace,
Your Holiness.

15:13.395 --> 15:18.059
Tell us more of this
considerate young man.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.627
He, uh, has
the energy of youth

15:20.694 --> 15:22.526
but the wisdom of age.

15:22.627 --> 15:24.426
He is attentive to counsel,

15:24.493 --> 15:26.792
but decisive in
his own authority.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.591
And most of all,

15:28.659 --> 15:31.423
he wishes no discord with Rome
or with her pope.

15:31.491 --> 15:33.657
Are we to believe
he is without fault?

15:35.390 --> 15:38.522
Well -
you could perhaps,

15:38.590 --> 15:40.422
were you not
to meet his wife.

15:43.089 --> 15:44.589
His wife?

15:48.089 --> 15:50.655
[quietly] It is the most
unfortunate match.

15:50.723 --> 15:52.322
The shame of France.

15:52.423 --> 15:53.889
Hm.

15:53.955 --> 15:55.987
Arranged, of course,
when he was only a child.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.020
Back then no one knew
how she would develop.

15:58.088 --> 16:00.953
And now we know...

16:01.054 --> 16:04.587
All we can do is wish -

16:04.688 --> 16:06.757
wish for an act of God.

16:08.861 --> 16:10.760
<i>My apologies,</i>
<i>Your Holiness.</i>

16:10.828 --> 16:12.293
I have entirely
forgotten myself.

16:12.394 --> 16:13.759
Please forgive me.

16:13.861 --> 16:18.459
Oh, you have our forgiveness.

16:18.527 --> 16:20.759
Let us talk...

16:20.860 --> 16:22.492
further...

16:22.560 --> 16:24.692
if you so desire...

16:24.760 --> 16:29.391
of, uh,
the shame of France.

16:37.425 --> 16:39.390
KING FERDINAND:
The Royal Guard.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.657
Here lies the true worth
of Naples, my Lord Borgia,

16:42.725 --> 16:45.923
not in its buildings nor
its peasants, but here.

16:45.991 --> 16:47.324
Impressive.

16:47.392 --> 16:49.724
And yet merely the razor
tip of the great spear

16:49.825 --> 16:51.557
that is the Neapolitan army.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.257
Straight!

16:53.324 --> 16:54.624
If I may ask...

16:54.691 --> 16:57.723
uh, how many men does
Naples have under arms?

16:57.791 --> 16:59.892
Ten thousand men.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.296
Impressive.

17:05.430 --> 17:08.296
One might almost say...
incredible.

17:09.730 --> 17:12.994
[door creaking open]

17:18.296 --> 17:19.694
[chain rattling]

17:19.762 --> 17:24.094
[grunting]

17:30.028 --> 17:31.494
Put that down!

17:31.561 --> 17:33.727
No more fucking thieving,
do you hear me?

17:46.100 --> 17:47.435
You're telling me

17:47.502 --> 17:49.370
that people would wish
to steal such shit?

17:49.471 --> 17:51.171
[gasps in disbelief]

17:51.272 --> 17:53.073
That's good armour, that.

17:53.141 --> 17:54.808
Just needs shaking
in sand for 10 minutes;

17:54.876 --> 17:56.276
it'll come up good.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.846
[armour hitting armour]

17:58.914 --> 18:00.548
You shake this in
sand for 10 minutes

18:00.616 --> 18:03.518
and all you'll end
up with is rust.

18:03.586 --> 18:05.454
[chuckles]

18:20.136 --> 18:22.171
Now as to residence -

18:22.272 --> 18:23.639
on her marriage,

18:23.706 --> 18:25.173
your sister will become
the Duchess of Bisceglie.

18:25.241 --> 18:26.575
We had-

18:26.643 --> 18:30.178
Some attendance at the
court would be in order.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.747
We had already discussed it.

18:31.815 --> 18:35.250
She's happy to undertake
any duties that are expected.

18:35.318 --> 18:37.153
Agreed.

18:37.220 --> 18:40.291
Very well; then I think our
business here is concluded.

18:41.827 --> 18:45.163
There is one other thing.

18:45.231 --> 18:46.665
The child.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.201
The bastard son?

18:52.108 --> 18:53.042
Yes.

18:53.143 --> 18:54.510
My feelings on that matter

18:54.578 --> 18:57.313
have already been made
abundantly clear.

18:57.380 --> 18:59.214
I do not ask that you
parade him in public.

18:59.282 --> 19:00.649
I do not ask that you
make any statement,

19:00.717 --> 19:01.951
any commitment.

19:02.018 --> 19:03.485
But to separate a
mother from her child -

19:03.553 --> 19:05.855
Her bastard child.
A child that she loves -

19:05.923 --> 19:07.723
A bastard child nevertheless.

19:09.093 --> 19:12.929
All I ask is that Giovanni
should accompany his mother.

19:13.030 --> 19:15.365
Quietly, if you wish.

19:15.433 --> 19:17.167
In the company of a nursemaid.

19:17.235 --> 19:19.669
Out of the public eye,
but in the bosom of his family.

19:19.770 --> 19:21.838
His family
is to be my family,

19:21.906 --> 19:23.640
a family that traces
back its lineage

19:23.708 --> 19:25.175
to Aragon and Castille,

19:25.243 --> 19:28.145
the kings and queens
of Spain and Portugal,

19:28.213 --> 19:31.048
and I can assure you,
my Lord Borgia,

19:31.149 --> 19:33.951
my family has never
encompassed

19:34.018 --> 19:36.220
the offspring
of stable boys.

19:40.592 --> 19:42.959
You would risk an
open breach over this?

19:43.027 --> 19:44.628
An open breach with me?

19:44.695 --> 19:49.399
Do not parade your empty threats
around here, Cesare Borgia.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.267
Rome needs Naples -

19:51.335 --> 19:52.802
you know this
as well as I do.

19:52.870 --> 19:55.905
Your father sent you here
to consolidate an alliance,

19:55.973 --> 19:58.408
not to treat favours
for an infant.

19:58.476 --> 19:59.996
I'm not here to
consolidate an alliance

20:00.078 --> 20:01.578
but to consider one.

20:01.646 --> 20:03.726
And I will consider one
elsewhere if the need arises.

20:09.288 --> 20:12.257
Do not be hasty,
Your Highness.

20:12.358 --> 20:14.392
Turn the matter
over in your mind.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.760
Come to my
sister's wedding

20:15.828 --> 20:17.428
and let us have
your answer then.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.502
MAN:
Highness.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.440
<i>[door closes]</i>

20:29.541 --> 20:31.509
Why did you say nothing?

20:31.610 --> 20:33.077
What?

20:37.049 --> 20:39.084
You sat there,
meek as a girl -

20:39.151 --> 20:41.353
[gasps]
and said not one word.

20:42.388 --> 20:43.689
Your wife!
Your family!

20:43.756 --> 20:45.324
Have you nothing
to say?

20:50.362 --> 20:52.263
Back to Rome.

21:00.073 --> 21:04.643
[quiet conversations]

21:17.658 --> 21:19.893
There's a report.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.628
A report in what?

21:21.696 --> 21:23.263
The state of the army.

21:23.364 --> 21:25.999
Stores, powder,
shots for the cannon,

21:26.100 --> 21:27.834
readiness of the men.

21:27.902 --> 21:30.070
Commissioned for
the pope himself.

21:30.137 --> 21:32.472
In preparation for war.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.341
What else?

21:37.946 --> 21:39.547
<i>[coins clanging]</i>

21:41.484 --> 21:44.019
I should very much
like to see it.

21:45.155 --> 21:47.756
[Lucrezia giggles]

21:54.899 --> 21:57.000
[giggles]

21:57.067 --> 21:58.568
Was it pleasant
to see your home?

21:58.669 --> 22:00.270
Yes.

22:01.939 --> 22:04.073
You and I should
speak together.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.011
<i>LUCREZIA:</i>
<i>He refused?</i>

22:10.514 --> 22:12.549
When he finally
comes to his senses

22:12.616 --> 22:14.684
he will realize that
one child's happiness

22:14.752 --> 22:16.719
is a small price to pay
for the goodwill of Rome.

22:16.787 --> 22:20.222
Yes, one child's happiness.
And that of his mother.

22:20.323 --> 22:22.458
Is that so much to ask,

22:22.525 --> 22:24.026
that threats must be made,

22:24.094 --> 22:26.561
alliances held in jeopardy?

22:26.629 --> 22:28.830
[scoffs]

22:28.898 --> 22:31.366
Am I so hard to love?

22:31.434 --> 22:33.301
No.
No, my love.

22:35.304 --> 22:38.072
Rome is the peak
of the world,

22:38.140 --> 22:42.210
and we are at its pinnacle,
and yet...

22:42.277 --> 22:44.946
still, no matter
which way I turn,

22:45.013 --> 22:46.581
I still can't seem to find

22:46.649 --> 22:49.651
that which will
make me truly happy.

22:49.718 --> 22:51.319
Why can I not be happy?

22:51.387 --> 22:54.055
I will make you happy.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.557
[quietly]
I promise.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.500
ALEXANDER:
Forgive my prurience.

23:05.567 --> 23:06.868
Am I to understand

23:06.936 --> 23:12.206
she is so uncomely
she is unbeddable?

23:12.274 --> 23:14.175
In all honesty, then...

23:14.243 --> 23:16.611
Yes, honesty,
is always good.

23:16.679 --> 23:20.749
She is what we must
call a two-sack woman.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.251
What?

23:22.352 --> 23:23.886
There are women one
might take to bed

23:23.954 --> 23:26.289
only if they were to wear
a sack over their heads.

23:26.390 --> 23:28.091
And then there are others

23:28.158 --> 23:30.126
where you too must
wear a sack,

23:30.194 --> 23:32.029
lest theirs fall off.

23:32.096 --> 23:33.430
[sputters]

23:33.498 --> 23:37.333
Sadly, she is more
than likely barren.

23:37.401 --> 23:39.236
Ah.

23:41.506 --> 23:48.413
Well, King Louis
has our every sympathy.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.416
I am most encouraged to hear
you say so, Your Holiness.

23:53.919 --> 23:56.854
Now, we should
bid you goodnight.

24:06.665 --> 24:08.800
<i>[door closing]</i>

24:08.868 --> 24:10.769
It could hardly
have been clearer.

24:10.837 --> 24:12.771
He wants an annulment.
Uh-huh.

24:12.839 --> 24:14.506
And you're the only person
in Christendom

24:14.574 --> 24:16.542
who can give it to him.
Uh-huh.

24:19.612 --> 24:20.913
This is it.

24:21.014 --> 24:23.549
This is where the game turns.

24:23.617 --> 24:26.152
Everyone fears the French,

24:26.219 --> 24:28.454
and we hold their royal
succession in our hands.

24:28.555 --> 24:30.089
Everyone fears the French.

24:30.157 --> 24:32.892
Especially those who have
felt her sword, like Naples.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.461
Ah!
I have seen Naples, Father.

24:35.529 --> 24:37.363
There is nothing there.

24:41.134 --> 24:44.870
Nothing but a king whose throat
I would joyfully slit.

24:44.938 --> 24:47.740
A warehouse full of rust
and spiderwebs.

24:47.807 --> 24:49.308
No army, no will,

24:49.376 --> 24:52.277
just a leper with his hand
out begging Rome for coin.

24:55.248 --> 24:56.649
Hm.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.721
Your sister
marries Naples.

25:05.826 --> 25:08.995
Why don't you
marry France?

25:12.933 --> 25:15.100
And you would hold two states
in the palm of your hand:

25:15.168 --> 25:17.736
France and Naples.

25:17.804 --> 25:21.473
Cesare to France,
Lucrezia to Naples.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.708
Two states,

25:23.776 --> 25:28.613
one who desires the other.

25:28.681 --> 25:33.451
A desire that is destined
to be frustrated.

25:33.519 --> 25:37.922
Once your sister
is married to Naples,

25:38.023 --> 25:40.425
you will take ship
to France.

25:40.492 --> 25:42.560
You will take with
you a papal brief

25:42.628 --> 25:45.997
granting annulment to
the king's marriage.

25:46.064 --> 25:49.167
But you will not grant
this gift lightly.

25:49.234 --> 25:54.838
You will use every
advantage you can.

25:54.939 --> 25:57.675
Hm?

25:57.742 --> 26:01.212
As you said yourself:
everybody fears France.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.649
Well, let it be
everybody but us.

26:07.020 --> 26:11.390
And while you're there...

26:11.457 --> 26:13.725
find yourself a bride.

26:17.764 --> 26:19.398
[sighs]

26:23.738 --> 26:27.574
RUFIO: Your cousin
banished Vitelli.

26:27.642 --> 26:32.446
Your family dispossessed.

26:32.513 --> 26:34.748
Your cousin-
Cardinal Orsini-

26:34.816 --> 26:37.017
dead, at the pope's own hand.

26:37.085 --> 26:40.520
What more convincing do you
need to come to my lady's side?

26:40.588 --> 26:42.122
Your mistress
deludes herself

26:42.190 --> 26:44.224
if she believes she can be
victor over the Pope of Rome.

26:44.325 --> 26:47.394
My mistress alone...
perhaps.

26:47.461 --> 26:50.964
The assassinations failed.
He lives.

26:51.032 --> 26:52.632
The alternative
you would bring us

26:52.700 --> 26:54.834
is open warfare against
the papal armies of Rome.

26:54.902 --> 26:56.703
That is a great deal
more of a risk

26:56.771 --> 26:58.138
than a blade in the dark.

26:58.206 --> 27:00.707
And the blade in the
dark failed miserably...

27:00.775 --> 27:03.043
What if it was
less of a risk?

27:04.779 --> 27:07.147
What if it was more
of a certainty?

27:27.002 --> 27:29.604
Dear God.

27:29.672 --> 27:31.238
Is this information accurate?

27:31.306 --> 27:32.974
This is an exact
copy of the report

27:33.041 --> 27:36.510
commissioned by
Cesare Borgia himself.

27:36.578 --> 27:38.813
It's accurate.

27:38.881 --> 27:41.449
The papal armies of Rome...

27:41.517 --> 27:43.885
barely exist.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.453
SERVANT:
I was told to deliver these.

27:45.555 --> 27:47.055
Shall I take them through?

27:47.123 --> 27:48.790
VANOZZA:
Yes, take that one.

27:48.891 --> 27:50.526
And over there.

27:50.593 --> 27:52.528
<i>SERVANT:</i>
<i>Where would you like them?</i>

27:52.629 --> 27:54.062
Over there.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.664
Should we arrange King
Ferdinand's retinue

27:55.731 --> 27:58.166
and family on the one hand,
and ours on the other,

27:58.234 --> 28:00.502
or should we take
the fashionable route

28:00.570 --> 28:02.771
and let the guests
intermingle?

28:04.974 --> 28:06.909
What is it?

28:06.976 --> 28:08.810
Cesare is to go to France.

28:08.911 --> 28:11.045
What of it?

28:11.113 --> 28:13.247
Straight after my wedding -

28:13.315 --> 28:15.149
the wedding that
shackles me to Naples -

28:15.217 --> 28:18.820
my brother sets sail to court
Naples's greatest enemy.

28:18.921 --> 28:20.255
He said as much?

28:20.322 --> 28:23.825
No.
But it was in his eyes.

28:23.893 --> 28:25.727
He can't hide things from me.

28:26.829 --> 28:28.897
Why are you so upset?

28:28.998 --> 28:31.099
This makes no odds
between Alfonso and you -

28:31.166 --> 28:33.434
What rules this family,
Mother?

28:34.703 --> 28:36.170
Love.

28:36.271 --> 28:38.173
[laughs]

28:38.240 --> 28:39.541
Ambition.

28:39.642 --> 28:42.110
Ambition rules this family.

28:42.212 --> 28:43.979
My father's.

28:44.047 --> 28:46.115
My brother's.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.217
And I will have to add to that,

28:48.285 --> 28:51.354
my own if I don't want to
live in a garden of weeds.

28:51.422 --> 28:53.623
[quietly]
Lucrezia...

28:56.626 --> 29:01.063
It was you who purged the poison
from your father's veins.

29:01.131 --> 29:04.567
In that hour,
you saved Rome.

29:04.634 --> 29:06.802
I believe you are
the equal to any task,

29:06.870 --> 29:09.838
least of all that of
taking care of your family.

29:09.939 --> 29:11.940
Do you hear?

29:12.008 --> 29:14.076
Have more faith in yourself.

29:14.144 --> 29:15.778
I shall.

29:15.846 --> 29:17.713
There's no one else
to have faith in.

29:21.018 --> 29:22.718
He's done what?

29:22.786 --> 29:24.454
Invited her
to the wedding.

29:24.521 --> 29:28.092
He would invite that bitch
whore into our house?

29:28.160 --> 29:30.094
Not alone.

29:30.161 --> 29:31.595
Gian Paulo Baglioni,

29:31.663 --> 29:33.030
Prospero Colonna-
Oh!

29:33.098 --> 29:34.798
The Orsini brothers.
Vitelezzo Vitelli.

29:34.866 --> 29:37.001
Half the Lords
of the Romagna!

29:40.705 --> 29:42.773
And Catherina Sforza.

29:42.841 --> 29:45.342
And Catherina Sforza.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.045
As honoured guests of
King Ferdinand of Naples.

29:51.450 --> 29:53.217
Why is he doing this?

29:53.319 --> 29:55.987
I don't know.
To show his strength?

29:56.055 --> 29:58.256
To show that Naples
does not stand alone?

29:58.323 --> 30:00.191
To throw my own
words back in my face

30:00.259 --> 30:01.693
and show that the
alliance with Rome

30:01.760 --> 30:03.961
is only one of any number
he would consider.

30:04.029 --> 30:05.763
You'll forbid it, of course.

30:05.831 --> 30:08.500
What, and insult him publicly?
Humiliate him?

30:08.567 --> 30:11.035
Yes.
Yes, why not?

30:11.103 --> 30:14.205
Because the whole
of Italy is watching!

30:14.273 --> 30:16.208
Would you have
them see us divided

30:16.275 --> 30:17.676
even amongst
our own family?

30:17.777 --> 30:19.611
Bickering like peasants?

30:19.679 --> 30:21.179
Do you not see

30:21.247 --> 30:25.250
that even the impression
of weakness begets weakness?

30:25.317 --> 30:27.486
No.

30:27.554 --> 30:32.292
We are the Pope of Rome,
the vicar of Christ.

30:32.359 --> 30:34.594
Let her come.

30:41.336 --> 30:43.070
My lord.

30:52.147 --> 30:53.447
[earring jangles]

30:55.850 --> 30:58.986
I placed you here,
as you see.

30:59.087 --> 31:01.055
At my side.

31:01.123 --> 31:03.591
I see it.

31:07.963 --> 31:09.897
Are you?

31:13.635 --> 31:15.469
Of course,
at your side.

31:15.537 --> 31:20.340
Whatever happens:
France, or Spain, Naples...

31:20.408 --> 31:23.243
they can crumble to dust,
for all I care.

31:23.311 --> 31:25.679
As long as you -

31:26.915 --> 31:36.057
[breathing heavily]

31:40.262 --> 31:41.695

<i>Countess of Forli</i>
<i>and Lady of Imola.</i>

34:31.533 --> 34:35.335
We had almost lost hope
of having you kneel before us.

34:35.402 --> 34:37.670
I bend my knee to no man...

34:42.777 --> 34:45.312
unless I choose to.

35:00.628 --> 35:02.108
We should have
prepared her apartments

35:02.163 --> 35:03.630
in the Castel
Sant Angelo...

35:03.698 --> 35:05.632
Hm.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.268
I knew she was clever,

35:08.336 --> 35:12.339
but I never realized
how clever until today.

35:14.043 --> 35:16.611
Well, put her from your mind.

35:16.679 --> 35:20.482
The die is cast

35:20.550 --> 35:24.552
and we must hazard everything
or leave the game.

35:35.398 --> 35:36.932
Have you lost your mind?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.601
What have you done,
you fool!

35:39.669 --> 35:41.537
You invite her here?

35:41.638 --> 35:43.138
Into the heart
of Rome

35:43.206 --> 35:44.606
onto the steps
of the Vatican

35:44.674 --> 35:46.342
for the whole
world to see?

35:46.409 --> 35:47.743
You're insane.

35:47.811 --> 35:49.345
And you're naive!

35:49.413 --> 35:51.614
My invitation of Catherina
Sforza is a move in the game,

35:51.648 --> 35:54.516
as is your marriage
to the pope's daughter.

35:54.584 --> 35:56.752
My marriage is no game.
Don't be a child.

35:56.819 --> 35:58.954
I love Lucrezia.
Maybe you can't understand -

35:59.022 --> 36:02.257
Whether you love her,
hate her, are repulsed by her -

36:02.325 --> 36:03.792
you marry her,

36:03.860 --> 36:06.128
and you secure our claim
to the friendship of Rome.

36:06.195 --> 36:08.664
Why else do you think I put
you forward to be her suitor?

36:08.765 --> 36:10.099
[scoffs]

36:10.166 --> 36:13.169
And therefore also choose
to remind His Holiness

36:13.237 --> 36:16.539
that Naples has friends,
friends beyond Rome.

36:16.607 --> 36:19.175
And if Rome wishes the
friendship of Naples,

36:19.243 --> 36:23.180
that friendship needs to
be cultivated, nurtured -

36:23.248 --> 36:26.350
She tried to kill
his children!

36:26.451 --> 36:27.385
His grandchild!

36:27.486 --> 36:29.353
That, too, is the game;

36:29.421 --> 36:32.456
a game in which you are
new and uninstructed.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.725
Now, play your part.

36:34.792 --> 36:37.728
Get married,
fuck the pope's daughter,

36:37.795 --> 36:40.630
and leave the serious
matters for your elders.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.501

my congratulations

38:48.166 --> 38:51.636

of her marriage.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.471

to tell her.

38:57.911 --> 39:00.045
Should I also offer my
father your congratulations

39:00.113 --> 39:02.314
on his recovery
from poison?

39:02.382 --> 39:04.316
My family
your congratulations

39:04.384 --> 39:07.185
on their escape
from assassination?

39:07.253 --> 39:08.987
If it pleases you to do so.

39:12.692 --> 39:15.461
You risk everything, my lady.

39:15.528 --> 39:18.897
Do you think me
ignorant of that?

all they had before,

43:35.288 --> 43:37.589
You have no army.

44:32.548 --> 44:33.949
You know I am.

44:34.017 --> 44:37.151
Saving yourself
for marriage.

44:37.219 --> 44:38.753
I told you as much,
didn't I?

44:38.821 --> 44:41.589
And, um,

44:41.690 --> 44:43.991
are we now married?

44:44.059 --> 44:47.294
I believe so.
I seem to remember a ceremony.

44:47.361 --> 44:48.762
I also.

44:49.797 --> 44:51.331
[giggles]

44:52.900 --> 44:58.771
[giggles]

45:00.908 --> 45:03.343

45:03.444 --> 45:05.512
[giggles]

45:10.385 --> 45:14.722
[breathing heavily]

45:14.789 --> 45:16.723
What's this?
This board?

45:16.824 --> 45:18.025
It's nothing.

45:18.092 --> 45:19.860
It's seating arrangements
for the wedding.

45:19.928 --> 45:25.899
[murmurs with pleasure]

45:26.000 --> 45:27.434
Fuck me.

45:34.643 --> 45:36.110
This isn't the wedding.

45:36.178 --> 45:39.446
This is ally on the one hand
and enemy on the other.

45:39.547 --> 45:40.647
Who did this?

45:40.715 --> 45:43.184
Only my brother
would have -

45:51.827 --> 45:56.731
Is this what I am
to your brother?

45:56.832 --> 45:58.333
A question mark.

46:00.669 --> 46:02.270
A question mark.

46:02.338 --> 46:04.006
A QUESTION MARK!

46:05.741 --> 46:08.343
Is this what I am
to your family?

46:13.683 --> 46:15.617

46:47.384 --> 46:49.219

[door creaking open]

47:45.911 --> 47:47.945
What on God's earth?

47:51.416 --> 47:53.651
Am I so hard to love?

47:57.989 --> 47:59.222
No, Lucrezia -
you cannot.

47:59.323 --> 48:01.558
But I must.

48:01.625 --> 48:06.630
[breathing heavily]

48:06.697 --> 48:12.703
Only a Borgia, it seems,
can truly love a Borgia.

48:12.804 --> 48:15.172
They already whisper it of us-

48:15.239 --> 48:20.777
throughout the whole
of Italy.

48:20.845 --> 48:22.446
Why deny ourselves
the pleasure

48:22.513 --> 48:26.416
of which we're
already accused?

48:26.517 --> 48:27.751
[breathing heavily]

48:27.819 --> 48:30.787
Your husband -

48:30.854 --> 48:34.390
You will be my husband...
tonight.
