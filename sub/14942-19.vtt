00:01.702 --> 00:03.073
Previously on "body of proof"...

00:03.074 --> 00:04.374
Dani! No!

00:04.375 --> 00:06.005
Somebody help me, please!

00:06.006 --> 00:08.778
Whatever that creep gave
her was attacking Dani.

00:08.779 --> 00:11.611
(Groans) No, no! Don't touch him!
Don't touch him! Call an ambulance.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.543
What if it's not a
poison but an infection?

00:13.544 --> 00:16.316
(Woman) Seizing en route.
She's massively hypotensive.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.747
I think we've got an outbreak.

00:17.748 --> 00:19.719
Dr. Charlie Stafford,
centers for disease control.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.191
YouTube flagged this.

00:21.192 --> 00:23.022
A whole lot of you
are going to die.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.023
It's an act of terrorism.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.156
Brendan Johnson, FBI
special agent in charge.

00:26.157 --> 00:27.327
Bodies!

00:27.328 --> 00:28.458
(Peter) Our terrorist
is patient zero.

00:28.459 --> 00:30.160
He infected himself
first, and then

00:30.161 --> 00:32.132
turned himself into
a suicide bomber.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.104
We're talking about
an exotic virus.

00:34.105 --> 00:35.066
(Stafford) Which
are more deadly.

00:35.067 --> 00:37.168
(Megan) But not airborne.

00:40.211 --> 00:41.711
(Camera shutters clicking)

00:41.712 --> 00:44.074
(Exhales) People,
the truth is...

00:44.075 --> 00:45.245
(Clicking continues)

00:45.246 --> 00:46.546
The terrorist is sick.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.078
(Clicking continues)

00:48.079 --> 00:49.079
He's...

00:49.080 --> 00:50.580
Infecting...

00:50.581 --> 00:52.422
All of you, and he's still...

00:52.423 --> 00:53.754
Out there.

00:55.386 --> 00:57.056
(Woman screams)

00:57.057 --> 00:58.458
Kate.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.130
(Indistinct conversations)

01:00.131 --> 01:02.092
I need an ambulance!

01:02.093 --> 01:03.333
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

01:03.334 --> 01:04.794
She's going into
circulatory collapse.

01:04.795 --> 01:05.835
(Gasps)

01:05.836 --> 01:07.197
I need an epipen.

01:07.198 --> 01:09.068
I have one. Here's one.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.340
I need both. Both?

01:10.341 --> 01:12.442
One's not gonna do it.

01:12.443 --> 01:13.773
On my count. Ready?

01:13.774 --> 01:15.675
One... two...

01:15.676 --> 01:17.076
(Kate gasps)

01:17.077 --> 01:18.308
(Gasp)

01:18.309 --> 01:20.650
(Pants)

01:20.651 --> 01:22.712
(Whispers) Megan.

01:22.713 --> 01:26.085
(Megan) Oh, thank god. (Exhales)

01:26.086 --> 01:27.617
(People speaking indistinctly)

01:27.618 --> 01:29.289
Listen to me,

01:29.290 --> 01:31.161
don't you die on me.

01:31.162 --> 01:33.193
Believe it or not, I don't
have a lot of girlfriends.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.825
I can't afford to lose even one.

01:35.826 --> 01:38.298
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

01:38.299 --> 01:41.371
(Gurney clatters)

01:41.372 --> 01:44.375
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

01:46.877 --> 01:49.179
That's it. I can't
wait any longer.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.211
I'm instituting mandatory
isolation wards.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.284
Anybody has a fever
over 98.7, they cough,

01:54.285 --> 01:55.585
we quarantine their ass,

01:55.586 --> 01:57.116
starting with her.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.819
(Siren wails)

01:59.820 --> 02:01.391
166 victims.

02:01.392 --> 02:02.722
92 are in the morgue.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.394
The rest are being
placed in isolation wards

02:04.395 --> 02:06.656
that are already
at overcapacity.

02:06.657 --> 02:09.729
If we continue at this rate,
half the city will be infected

02:09.730 --> 02:11.231
inside a week.

02:11.232 --> 02:14.264
Due to the good work of
some of the people in this room,

02:14.265 --> 02:16.266
we've been able to track
the movement of each Vic

02:16.267 --> 02:18.308
over the past 72 hours.

02:18.309 --> 02:20.670
Here's what we've discovered...

02:20.671 --> 02:22.172
These six clusters
Mark the areas

02:22.173 --> 02:23.673
where most of the victims

02:23.674 --> 02:25.515
crossed paths
with the terrorist.

02:25.516 --> 02:27.146
We have a bank,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.648
a convenience store,

02:28.649 --> 02:29.919
a gas station,

02:29.920 --> 02:31.281
pharmacy,

02:31.282 --> 02:33.453
coffeehouse, church.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.154
As you can see,
all but ten victims

02:35.155 --> 02:36.786
can be tracked to at
least one of these clusters.

02:36.787 --> 02:38.588
So these six areas

02:38.589 --> 02:40.830
are where we're gonna
concentrate the investigation.

02:40.831 --> 02:42.332
So what about the
ten that aren't traceable

02:42.333 --> 02:43.463
to any clusters?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.195
Uh, yes, the outliers.

02:45.196 --> 02:47.337
I see that your
girlfriend is one of them,

02:47.338 --> 02:48.468
and her timeline
is still half blank.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.639
Maybe if you filled that in,

02:49.640 --> 02:51.170
we could discover
which cluster she went to.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.772
What do you think
I've been doing?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.206
I haven't the
faintest idea, dunlop.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.478
(Megan sighs) As of an
hour ago, our body count

02:58.479 --> 03:01.611
went from 78 to 92 dead.

03:01.612 --> 03:02.952
We are going to find

03:02.953 --> 03:04.454
the son of a
bitch that did this.

03:04.455 --> 03:07.287
But in order to find the who,
we need to isolate the what.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.788
So tell me what you
know. What do we got?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.320
Antibiotics aren't working.

03:10.321 --> 03:12.292
E-Even the patients that
got them are crashing.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.294
We're seeing some
common symptoms...

03:14.295 --> 03:16.226
Uh, pancytopenia, pancreatitis,

03:16.227 --> 03:17.797
patchy liver cell necrosis,

03:17.798 --> 03:19.729
but not enough to
account for death.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.231
Then we're running
out of options.

03:21.232 --> 03:23.233
I've got one.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.235
(Stafford) Now you want
to tell me why we're having

03:25.236 --> 03:26.536
this meeting of the minds?

03:26.537 --> 03:27.907
(Megan) Tell me what you see.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.709
(Sighs)

03:29.710 --> 03:32.882
Hemorrhage.

03:32.883 --> 03:35.315
Ooh.

03:35.316 --> 03:39.989
Rather spectacular hemorrhage.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.752
Hemorrhage.

03:42.753 --> 03:44.754
Looks like we found our
common cause of death.

03:44.755 --> 03:46.256
Bravo, Dr. Hunt.

03:46.257 --> 03:48.298
Let's not do the
happy dance yet.

03:48.299 --> 03:50.630
We still have no clue
what this disease is.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.902
Yes, but we know what it does.

03:52.903 --> 03:55.435
Stage one, you think
you have a fever,

03:55.436 --> 03:57.467
not knowing that inside,

03:57.468 --> 03:59.339
all of the blood vessels

03:59.340 --> 04:01.371
in your internal organs
are starting to leak blood.

04:01.372 --> 04:02.812
Stage two,

04:02.813 --> 04:05.745
now you really know
you're in trouble.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.877
Maybe you... you get a rash,

04:07.878 --> 04:09.419
you start bleeding from
unmentionable orifices,

04:09.420 --> 04:10.720
but before you can do
anything about that...

04:10.721 --> 04:12.251
(Snaps fingers) Bam.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.323
Hypotensive shock.

04:13.324 --> 04:15.385
(Megan) Stage three,

04:15.386 --> 04:17.957
pulmonary edema, cerebral edema,

04:17.958 --> 04:19.289
death.

04:19.290 --> 04:24.033
Not more than 72 hours
between the first symptom

04:24.034 --> 04:25.936
and the last.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.400
(Fabric snaps)

04:30.401 --> 04:32.803
♪♪♪

04:37.578 --> 04:38.848
So you're telling
me this disease

04:38.849 --> 04:40.850
can turn your brain
into cat food in 72 hours,

04:40.851 --> 04:42.752
but you have no clue
what we're dealing with?

04:42.753 --> 04:45.515
You have over a hundred
dead bodies in the morgue.

04:45.516 --> 04:47.417
Can't you find a-a
microbe or something

04:47.418 --> 04:49.018
that can you tell you
what this thing is?

04:49.019 --> 04:52.862
Do you know how many microbes
there are in the human body?

04:52.863 --> 04:54.564
100 trillion.

04:54.565 --> 04:56.466
That's a 1 with 14
zeroes behind it.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.067
Looking for one microbe

04:58.068 --> 05:01.471
is like looking for one specific
drop of water in the Atlantic.

05:01.472 --> 05:02.632
How about this?

05:02.633 --> 05:04.374
Our little, uh,
terrorist typhoid Mary

05:04.375 --> 05:06.676
gave himself this
disease, right?

05:06.677 --> 05:08.638
And it kills in 72 hours.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.440
Is our guy even still alive?

05:10.441 --> 05:12.382
So you're saying,
one of our victims

05:12.383 --> 05:14.083
is actually the perp.

05:14.084 --> 05:15.945
(Stafford groans)

05:15.946 --> 05:17.887
I'm gonna wake up screaming
in the middle of the night

05:17.888 --> 05:20.520
years from now because
I didn't think of that.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.853
At first glance, I
can tell you this...

05:23.854 --> 05:25.995
Anyone who visited a
cluster is not our killer.

05:25.996 --> 05:27.557
Why not?

05:27.558 --> 05:29.729
We have a complete
timeline for each of them.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.361
They each visited a cluster.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.563
None of them visited all six.

05:33.564 --> 05:35.104
Our killer did, though.

05:35.105 --> 05:36.836
Who are these other people?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.508
They're anomalies, outliers.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.910
Ghosts, essentially, 'cause
we don't have their full timelines.

05:40.911 --> 05:42.812
Three are clinging
to... to life in isolation,

05:42.813 --> 05:44.614
seven are in your morgue.

05:44.615 --> 05:47.848
Maybe our terrorist
is one of 'em.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.626
We're looking for
injection marks,

05:56.627 --> 05:57.927
puncture wounds,

05:57.928 --> 05:59.989
anything that looks
like a deliberate cut.

05:59.990 --> 06:03.062
Come on. Dani
wasn't a terrorist.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.664
We can't afford
to not be thorough.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.466
You want me to do
it? I didn't know her.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.739
No, you didn't, so back off.

06:09.740 --> 06:11.401
You know, I hate this.

06:11.402 --> 06:14.073
Dani... dead. Kate's down.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.144
Peter's awol.

06:15.145 --> 06:16.906
We are falling apart.

06:16.907 --> 06:18.978
(Stafford) Feel free to
tell me to back off again,

06:18.979 --> 06:22.753
but where is Peter dunlop?

06:45.736 --> 06:47.738
(Hinges squeak)

07:33.453 --> 07:36.756
Ow.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.759
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

07:39.760 --> 07:43.162
(Indistinct conversations)

07:43.163 --> 07:45.134
Here. Let me.

07:45.135 --> 07:48.138
(Beeping continues)

07:53.473 --> 07:54.804
There we go.

07:54.805 --> 07:57.578
Good girl. Good girl.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.510
Say thank you to
the lady, Louise.

08:00.511 --> 08:01.681
Thank you.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.183
(Chuckles) She's shy.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.586
You must be a doctor.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.017
Yeah.

08:08.018 --> 08:09.258
How are you feeling?

08:09.259 --> 08:11.661
Honestly?

08:11.662 --> 08:13.192
Numb.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.896
My husband and I both
woke up sick yesterday.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.968
He had a sore throat.

08:18.969 --> 08:21.531
I had a fever and...

08:21.532 --> 08:23.633
He went to work.

08:23.634 --> 08:26.075
I took Louise to school.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.938
Now he's dead,

08:28.939 --> 08:31.942
and we're here.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.184
I'm sorry.

08:35.185 --> 08:37.186
You're a doctor. Maybe you know.

08:37.187 --> 08:38.718
Did... did he give it to me?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.990
Did I give it to my baby?

08:40.991 --> 08:43.192
Will we die, too?

08:43.193 --> 08:46.256
(Indistinct conversations)

08:53.033 --> 08:55.164
Listen, we made
it to the hospital.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.236
That makes us the lucky ones.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.008
They'll balance
our electrolytes,

08:59.009 --> 09:01.540
maintain our oxygen
status and blood pressure.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.542
And that all gives
us a fighting chance

09:03.543 --> 09:06.976
of holding on until they can
figure out what this thing is.

09:06.977 --> 09:08.718
(Marcel coughs)
Balance our electrolytes?

09:08.719 --> 09:10.980
(Coughs) That's a good one, doc.

09:10.981 --> 09:12.682
Does, uh, bourbon
have electrolytes in it?

09:12.683 --> 09:14.553
I could use a shot
right about now.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.285
Can't you see,
people are scared?

09:16.286 --> 09:17.257
Yeah, they should be.

09:17.258 --> 09:19.328
They're dying.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.631
And newsflash... so are we.

09:21.632 --> 09:23.562
So if you could get
that nurse for me,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.134
I was serious
about that bourbon.

09:25.135 --> 09:27.036
Really? A drink? Yeah, I
shoulda had one at the bar

09:27.037 --> 09:28.838
with that hottie the other day.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.569
What?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.002
Prisoner gets a
last meal, right?

09:33.003 --> 09:35.676
I want a last drink.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.352
Peter dunlop.

09:43.353 --> 09:44.684
Julie tompkins.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.015
You people are so crass.

09:46.016 --> 09:47.316
I know that this
seems intrusive,

09:47.317 --> 09:49.759
but frankly, people
are frightened.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.892
They want to know exactly
what their families are facing.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.724
Oh, cut it.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.195
Look,

09:56.196 --> 09:57.927
I want to know.

09:57.928 --> 10:00.029
My boyfriend just
died of this thing.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.330
(People speaking indistinctly)

10:01.331 --> 10:03.372
I don't have answers.

10:03.373 --> 10:05.335
That's honest, at least.

10:09.379 --> 10:12.111
This hooded figure
from the Internet,

10:12.112 --> 10:14.613
he's calling himself
"John q. Plague."

10:14.614 --> 10:16.886
Who is he? Who
are we looking for?

10:16.887 --> 10:20.319
We're looking for
someone weak...

10:20.320 --> 10:23.022
Who hides behind
masks and who...

10:23.023 --> 10:26.195
Spouts slogans that he learned
off the back of cereal boxes.

10:26.196 --> 10:27.697
He got hold of something deadly,

10:27.698 --> 10:29.699
and for the first time
in his pathetic life,

10:29.700 --> 10:31.801
he feels power.

10:31.802 --> 10:34.964
These outliers are
gonna remain outliers.

10:34.965 --> 10:37.266
I've got nothing but a guy
who cut himself shaving

10:37.267 --> 10:38.768
and two who have bed bug bites.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.710
That's it. No injection marks.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.712
Aside from a
couple of hangnails,

10:42.713 --> 10:44.313
I couldn't find much
of anything either.

10:44.314 --> 10:45.975
Well, I was hoping we
could at least add a couple

10:45.976 --> 10:48.217
of clusters to agent
Johnson's pretty little map.

10:48.218 --> 10:49.719
Where have you been?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.050
(Mask squeaks)

10:51.051 --> 10:53.222
I went to see if the lab
had finished running tests

10:53.223 --> 10:55.424
on those, uh, syringes
from the terrorist's drug den.

10:55.425 --> 10:56.986
That took you 45 minutes?

10:56.987 --> 10:58.688
Uh, no. They
weren't finished yet,

10:58.689 --> 11:00.329
so I tried calling
the isolation ward

11:00.330 --> 11:02.331
to see how Kate was doing,
but I couldn't get through, so i...

11:02.332 --> 11:03.733
Ethan,

11:03.734 --> 11:06.736
Kate does not want us
wasting our time calling her.

11:06.737 --> 11:09.668
She wants us to solve
the problem, find the killer.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.509
Maybe she'd like to
hear the voice of a friend.

11:13.403 --> 11:15.144
So tell me,

11:15.145 --> 11:17.406
what did the lab say
about the, uh, syringes?

11:17.407 --> 11:18.908
Oh, let me guess.

11:18.909 --> 11:21.380
The big three...
Heroin, cocaine, meth.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.982
Yes, uh, but here's the thing...

11:22.983 --> 11:24.854
One syringe had
a trace for a drug

11:24.855 --> 11:26.185
the lab wasn't testing for.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.017
They're trying
to isolate it now.

11:28.018 --> 11:29.688
Weird thing is, it
was the only syringe

11:29.689 --> 11:31.390
that was wiped clean of prints.

11:31.391 --> 11:34.924
That's not exactly
junkie etiquette.

11:34.925 --> 11:36.325
Mnh-mnh.

11:36.326 --> 11:37.997
We're thinking that syringe

11:37.998 --> 11:40.700
belonged to the
terrorist, aren't we?

11:41.401 --> 11:45.174
(Cell phone rings)

11:45.175 --> 11:47.036
(Ring) Tell whoever
it is, I'm busy.

11:47.037 --> 11:48.738
(Ring) (Sighs)

11:48.739 --> 11:50.379
(Ring)

11:50.380 --> 11:52.442
It's Kate.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.384
(Siren whoops)

11:55.385 --> 11:57.917
(Peter) We're
looking for a loser

11:57.918 --> 11:59.488
with a jumped-up god complex

11:59.489 --> 12:02.151
who thinks that the ability
to kill makes him a man,

12:02.152 --> 12:05.454
when in reality, he is
and he will remain...

12:05.455 --> 12:06.956
A coward.

12:06.957 --> 12:09.959
Hey, that's the guy
who beat me up.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.001
Someone needs to tell him,

12:12.002 --> 12:14.003
the world already
has one dirty Harry.

12:14.004 --> 12:15.504
Please shut up.

12:15.505 --> 12:17.736
That guy just lost
somebody he loves.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.038
Love? (Blows
raspberry) Overrated.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.040
Look at them.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.773
I'm glad I don't have
some moon-face relative

12:23.774 --> 12:26.445
slobbering all over
me, telling me how sad

12:26.446 --> 12:29.418
life is for them when
I die a horrible death.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.220
Sounds like sour grapes to me.

12:31.221 --> 12:34.423
Yeah? I haven't seen
anyone visit you, either, doc.

12:34.424 --> 12:38.127
(Indistinct conversations)

12:38.128 --> 12:41.330
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

12:41.331 --> 12:44.494
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

12:47.537 --> 12:50.500
(Marcel coughs)

12:53.773 --> 12:57.246
I came as soon as I could.

12:57.247 --> 13:00.149
And I-I should've come sooner.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.480
No, I'm sorry. No.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.982
You shouldn't be here.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.553
It's fine. I understand.

13:04.554 --> 13:06.455
I mean, it's good to
see a familiar face,

13:06.456 --> 13:09.219
but I didn't call you
here to hold my hand.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.061
The news, uh...

13:12.062 --> 13:14.263
Said there's a
clock on this thing...

13:14.264 --> 13:16.425
72 hours from
contraction to death.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.399
Has that timeline lengthened?

13:20.901 --> 13:23.573
No, it hasn't.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.236
That guy trevino collapsed

13:27.237 --> 13:28.537
in interrogation
the day Dani died,

13:28.538 --> 13:30.940
four days ago.

13:30.941 --> 13:34.244
So how come he's still alive?

13:46.296 --> 13:47.456
Marcel trevino...

13:47.457 --> 13:50.059
Part-time pickup
artist, full-time con artist,

13:50.060 --> 13:53.302
went into tachycardia
96 hours ago

13:53.303 --> 13:54.463
in a police interrogation cell.

13:54.464 --> 13:55.504
Once the c.D.C.

13:55.505 --> 13:57.206
And the FBI came in,

13:57.207 --> 13:59.508
he went from being a
suspect to just another victim.

13:59.509 --> 14:01.540
You guys kind of
forgot about him.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.542
Maybe trevino's alive because
he's the friggin' terrorist.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.514
Okay, maybe he managed
to figure out a way to,

14:05.515 --> 14:07.516
I don't know, stave off death

14:07.517 --> 14:09.078
so that he could spread
the disease longer.

14:09.079 --> 14:10.249
Bud interrogated him.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.520
He went through
his entire timeline.

14:11.521 --> 14:12.581
He wasn't at any
of the clusters.

14:12.582 --> 14:14.323
Well, maybe he lied.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.325
Maybe he made up the
timeline just to throw us off.

14:16.326 --> 14:18.457
I've heard worse
theories. Where?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.129
I've spent time with him.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.891
It's not like the guy's
exactly machiavelli.

14:21.892 --> 14:23.432
These days, you
don't have to be.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.394
All you need's Google
and an ax to grind.

14:25.395 --> 14:27.596
Or meanwhile, back
here on planet earth,

14:27.597 --> 14:30.569
maybe one of these 17 drugs

14:30.570 --> 14:33.102
he's taking for
preexisting conditions

14:33.103 --> 14:36.575
is accidentally slowing
down the inevitable.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.578
Nicotine patches
for his smoking habit,

14:39.579 --> 14:42.481
antabuse for a drinking habit,

14:42.482 --> 14:44.583
fluvoxamine for his o.C.D.,

14:44.584 --> 14:47.486
interferon for a
hep c infection,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.588
and doxycycline for chlamydia...

14:49.589 --> 14:51.490
This guy is a walking pharmacy.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.492
If one of those drugs is
somehow keeping him alive,

14:53.493 --> 14:55.894
we need to find out which one.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.027
Now.

15:00.530 --> 15:02.101
Yeah, I got it. Thank you.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.304
Any one of the 17
drugs in his system

15:05.305 --> 15:06.905
could aid in
slowing the disease,

15:06.906 --> 15:09.278
but to control test each
one, that's gonna take time.

15:09.279 --> 15:10.579
We don't have it.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.581
I just got the results back
on the lab from that syringe,

15:12.582 --> 15:14.443
the one that was wiped
clean of the prints?

15:14.444 --> 15:18.287
The mystery drug was interferon.

15:18.288 --> 15:20.289
Trevino is taking interferon.

15:20.290 --> 15:21.620
Yep.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.623
Maybe g-man Johnson is
the genius he thought he was.

15:24.624 --> 15:29.029
Trevino could be
our terrorist after all.

15:32.302 --> 15:33.562
(Dial tone drones)

15:33.563 --> 15:36.936
(Keypad beeping)

15:43.473 --> 15:45.444
(Phone rings)

15:45.445 --> 15:47.116
(Ring)

15:47.117 --> 15:48.477
Hi, you've reached Gina Alvarez.

15:48.478 --> 15:50.349
I'm not available right now...

15:50.350 --> 15:51.650
(Dani) Because she's drinking
margaritas on a beach in Brazil

15:51.651 --> 15:53.352
and she doesn't
want to talk to you.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.523
(Gina) Dani. (Laughs)

15:54.524 --> 15:55.724
Now I have to
rerecord this thing.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.086
How do you stop it?

15:57.087 --> 15:58.527
Leave it, mama. It's cute.

15:58.528 --> 16:00.490
(Voice mail beeps)

16:04.664 --> 16:06.195
Mrs. Alvarez,

16:06.196 --> 16:08.267
um, my name is Peter,

16:08.268 --> 16:10.399
Peter dunlop, and
i'm, uh, I'm Dan...

16:10.400 --> 16:13.443
Uh, I-I work... I work
with your daughter.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.745
I need you to call
me on this number

16:16.746 --> 16:19.049
as soon as you can, please.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.583
(Sighs deeply)

16:30.590 --> 16:33.062
Where have you been?

16:33.063 --> 16:34.563
Thank you for being
so understanding.

16:34.564 --> 16:36.565
Yesterday I was understanding.

16:36.566 --> 16:38.067
Today the city is in meltdown.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.668
So whatever you're
feeling, box it up,

16:39.669 --> 16:42.601
put it on the shelf
until this is over.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.074
Don't you dare.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.076
You know, we all have our own
way of dealing with this, Megan.

16:47.077 --> 16:49.238
And my way is to find out
what the hell happened to Dani.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.440
Your way is keeping
me shorthanded.

16:51.441 --> 16:52.711
Tell me something.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.643
Did you stop for a
second to call Lacey

16:54.644 --> 16:57.346
or Aidan or your mom?

16:57.347 --> 16:59.017
(Exhales)

16:59.018 --> 17:01.790
Aidan is out of town, and
Lacey's with my mother.

17:01.791 --> 17:03.722
What if they weren't?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.725
What if one of
them was on a slab

17:06.726 --> 17:08.427
in that room?

17:08.428 --> 17:09.728
Do you think there's
the tiniest chance

17:09.729 --> 17:11.530
that you'd be doing
things a bit differently?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.433
Peter, I get it.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.136
I know how much
she meant to you. I do.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.138
But you're not gonna
fill that void tonight,

17:19.139 --> 17:21.510
sitting here.

17:21.511 --> 17:22.811
And right now,

17:22.812 --> 17:25.574
I can't do this without you.

17:25.575 --> 17:28.517
(Exhales deeply)

17:28.518 --> 17:30.579
(Sighs)

17:30.580 --> 17:32.681
(Indistinct conversations)

17:32.682 --> 17:35.724
This is coming
through the tip line.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.686
It's from our guy.

17:37.687 --> 17:38.827
You're gonna want to hear this.

17:38.828 --> 17:40.529
(Man) I saw your man on TV,

17:40.530 --> 17:42.291
the one who called me a coward?

17:42.292 --> 17:44.293
(Coughs)

17:44.294 --> 17:45.734
When a dozen people are killed...
(Whispering) Hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:45.735 --> 17:47.166
Trace this. Trace this.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.199
In a wildfire, no one
calls the flames cowards.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.672
Overpopulation leads
to overconsumption.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.073
No system is exempt.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.476
Our blind... We got
a trace on the call.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.108
Dumb pursuit of the happy ending...
It's coming from a bar near the hospital.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.679
Sir, the m.E.'S
office is on line three.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.212
They think our guy
is Marcel trevino.

18:03.213 --> 18:06.285
(Indistinct conversations)

18:06.286 --> 18:08.787
(Man) FBI! Get down!
Get down! Everybody down!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.159
(Man) Get down
on the ground now!

18:10.160 --> 18:11.590
Do it! Do it!

18:11.591 --> 18:12.661
Down! Everybody down!

18:12.662 --> 18:13.623
I said get down!

18:13.624 --> 18:15.164
(Grunts)

18:15.165 --> 18:16.725
(Man) Get your hands
where we can see 'em! Now!

18:16.726 --> 18:18.567
(Men shouting indistinctly)
(Man) Stay right there!

18:18.568 --> 18:19.728
It's not him. On the floor!

18:19.729 --> 18:21.330
Damn. (Man) Move!

18:21.331 --> 18:22.771
Who was the last person to use
that phone? (Man) Get on the ground!

18:22.772 --> 18:24.273
Don't move! Uh, I don't know,

18:24.274 --> 18:26.335
but he... he left like ten
minutes ago, out the back.

18:26.336 --> 18:28.577
All right, guys, let's
go. Let's go. Come on.

18:28.578 --> 18:29.878
(Man) All right. Move it!

18:29.879 --> 18:31.780
(Man) Back door! Back door!

18:31.781 --> 18:34.413
(Man) Out in the
alley. (Man) We're on it.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.714
We may have missed our guy,

18:35.715 --> 18:38.248
but he left us a present.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.692
(Coughing)

18:43.693 --> 18:46.195
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

18:46.196 --> 18:48.897
(Marcel panting) Help me.

18:48.898 --> 18:51.700
(Indistinct conversations)

18:51.701 --> 18:53.602
Hey.

18:53.603 --> 18:55.404
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

18:55.405 --> 18:56.765
Oh, god.

18:56.766 --> 18:59.808
I'm so alone.

18:59.809 --> 19:02.611
(Crying)

19:02.612 --> 19:04.814
I don't want to die alone.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.678
(Indistinct conversations)

19:09.679 --> 19:11.680
All right, what am I looking at?

19:11.681 --> 19:13.852
I sent our blood
samples to the c.D.C.,

19:13.853 --> 19:16.825
had them look at them
under the electron microscope.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.857
This is what we got.
Trevino's on the right.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.359
The person who made
the phone call on the left.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.930
Not the same. I got that much.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.932
But they are both on interferon.

19:23.933 --> 19:27.796
Trevino is taking it
for his hep c infection.

19:27.797 --> 19:30.399
This guy's taking a much
more concentrated form.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.471
It's human Alpha recombinant 2b.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.172
I say, he's taking it
deliberately to stay alive.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.805
Why? Is it a cure? Should we
start giving it to the infected?

19:36.806 --> 19:38.847
No, indications show that it
only slows the disease down.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.609
But the killer
could be taking it

19:40.610 --> 19:42.711
to stay alive long enough
to infect more people.

19:42.712 --> 19:43.852
Wonderful.

19:43.853 --> 19:46.385
We've got a walking dead
man who refuses to die.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.887
Chin up, little buckaroo.
This, too, is fantastic news.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.389
We're looking at the two people

19:50.390 --> 19:52.561
who have lived the
longest with the disease.

19:52.562 --> 19:54.723
Therefore, they have
a higher viral load

19:54.724 --> 19:56.565
in the bloodstream.

19:56.566 --> 19:57.896
Maybe you can explain to me

19:57.897 --> 19:59.898
how that's supposed
to make me happy?

19:59.899 --> 20:02.631
Because we just went
from fishing in the Atlantic

20:02.632 --> 20:05.774
to shark hunting in a
puddle, agent Johnson.

20:05.775 --> 20:06.935
With more disease cells present,

20:06.936 --> 20:08.477
we have a better
chance of isolating

20:08.478 --> 20:09.738
what the hell
we're dealing with.

20:09.739 --> 20:11.940
Oh, no.

20:11.941 --> 20:14.343
Candy canes and cheerios.

20:14.344 --> 20:15.814
What?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.787
You see those rod-shaped
cells that hook at the end

20:18.788 --> 20:21.690
with little circles around
them, looks like cheerios?

20:21.691 --> 20:24.693
There's only one virus on
the planet looks like that.

20:24.694 --> 20:26.255
What is it?

20:26.256 --> 20:29.258
You've heard of ebola?

20:29.259 --> 20:31.761
Meet his nastier bastard cousin.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.341
It's called marburg.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.842
It's one of three viruses

20:43.843 --> 20:46.415
in the class of
ebola s and ebola z

20:46.416 --> 20:47.716
known to man.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.247
But this is good news.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.849
How can that possibly
be good news?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.681
Well, because it isn't ebola.

20:52.682 --> 20:55.454
See, marburg burns
brighter, dies quicker,

20:55.455 --> 20:56.755
it makes it much more rare.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.457
(All speaking indistinctly)

20:58.458 --> 21:00.529
If it's so rare, how the
hell did our terrorist get it?

21:00.530 --> 21:01.690
From a level 4

21:01.691 --> 21:02.861
maximum-security
containment lab.

21:02.862 --> 21:03.833
This is good news.

21:03.834 --> 21:05.694
There are only a few
places on the planet

21:05.695 --> 21:07.696
this strain could come from.

21:07.697 --> 21:09.399
Is there a cure?

21:10.740 --> 21:13.472
(Sighs) That's the bad news.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.643
(Monitor emitting
continuous tone)

21:14.644 --> 21:15.804
(Man) Code blue! Code blue!

21:15.805 --> 21:17.676
(Woman) Bring in the crash cart!

21:17.677 --> 21:19.548
She's flatlining!

21:19.549 --> 21:20.879
(Man) I need a crash cart, stat!

21:20.880 --> 21:23.352
Okay!

21:23.353 --> 21:24.883
Prep for intubation.

21:24.884 --> 21:25.855
She's flatlining.

21:25.856 --> 21:26.856
Code blue.

21:26.857 --> 21:28.457
(Woman) Losing her! Code blue.

21:28.458 --> 21:29.958
(Woman speaks indistinctly)

21:29.959 --> 21:31.320
(Man speaks indistinctly)

21:31.321 --> 21:32.491
Got it. Bagging her now.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.494
(People speaking indistinctly)

21:35.495 --> 21:36.665
(Man shouts indistinctly)

21:36.666 --> 21:37.926
(Woman) Clear the I.V.

21:37.927 --> 21:39.628
(Defibrillator whining)

21:39.629 --> 21:41.870
(People shout indistinctly)

21:41.871 --> 21:44.002
(Sam) We gotta get
this son of a bitch.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.374
But how?

21:45.375 --> 21:46.535
(Stafford clears throat)

21:46.536 --> 21:48.737
Stop thinking of him
as a son of a bitch.

21:48.738 --> 21:50.739
Stop thinking of him as a man.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.441
I chase viruses for a living.

21:52.442 --> 21:55.514
I know where they like to hide.
I know where they like to hunt.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.616
This man is a human virus,

21:57.617 --> 21:59.548
and these are his
hunting grounds.

21:59.549 --> 22:00.849
What do they have in common?

22:00.850 --> 22:05.323
Why does he need to
feed where he feeds?

22:05.324 --> 22:07.557
Stafford.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.831
Can we have the room?

22:21.471 --> 22:23.341
I've heard what you've
been telling people,

22:23.342 --> 22:24.513
that there's no cure.

22:24.514 --> 22:25.814
You cannot tell
me that the c.D.C.

22:25.815 --> 22:27.516
Isn't working on one.

22:27.517 --> 22:29.518
Of course we're working on one.

22:29.519 --> 22:31.349
Right now we're
concentrating on prevention.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.851
We gotta catch this guy.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.823
Well, more people are
gonna get this disease

22:33.824 --> 22:35.353
before we ever catch this guy,

22:35.354 --> 22:36.985
so what are we gonna
do, just write them off?

22:36.986 --> 22:38.927
Them? You mean your friend.

22:38.928 --> 22:41.089
Let me give you the speech
you gave your boy Ethan.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.832
Dr. Murphy needs
us to catch this guy.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.834
And I know she's
your friend, too.

22:45.835 --> 22:46.965
You can't save her.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.398
You can.

22:49.839 --> 22:51.099
No, I can't.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.572
Some experimental trial,
a vaccine, something?

22:53.573 --> 22:56.445
Yes, there's an
experimental vaccine.

22:56.446 --> 22:57.706
It has never been
tried on people.

22:57.707 --> 22:59.007
And when are you gonna
get a better human trial

22:59.008 --> 23:02.050
than an outbreak
right under your nose?

23:02.051 --> 23:05.715
Fort Derrick is an hour
away by medical chopper.

23:08.788 --> 23:12.522
(Indistinct conversations)

23:22.732 --> 23:24.003
(Sighs)

23:34.013 --> 23:36.585
How you doin' in here?

23:36.586 --> 23:37.886
(Voice breaking) Not so good.

23:37.887 --> 23:39.988
(Chuckles)

23:39.989 --> 23:41.890
I started getting the rash

23:41.891 --> 23:45.794
and the fever and jaundice,

23:45.795 --> 23:48.126
sensitivity to light,
abdominal cramps.

23:48.127 --> 23:51.129
(Exhales deeply) Sorry.
Talk about blubbering.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.661
(Sniffles)

23:52.662 --> 23:54.563
It's gon' be all
right. It's okay.

23:54.564 --> 23:55.864
My brother couldn't make it in.

23:55.865 --> 23:58.036
They closed the airports.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.640
He's all I've got.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.973
I never thought I
would die alone.

24:04.974 --> 24:06.144
Well, what the hell am I,

24:06.145 --> 24:07.916
chopped liver?

24:07.917 --> 24:09.848
(Chuckles)

24:09.849 --> 24:11.780
You are not alone.

24:11.781 --> 24:12.981
I'm gonna

24:12.982 --> 24:14.923
sit here with you
till they kick me out.

24:14.924 --> 24:17.686
(Laughs and sniffles)

24:17.687 --> 24:20.058
(Cries)

24:20.059 --> 24:21.030
Okay?

24:21.031 --> 24:22.961
Thanks.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.064
Okay, I get Stafford's
human virus theory.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.096
And I agree that this guy is
living, breathing viral scum,

24:28.097 --> 24:30.098
but I don't see a pattern here.

24:30.099 --> 24:31.800
Yeah, it took us a minute, too.

24:31.801 --> 24:33.041
But look again.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.674
All are places that have
high-volume turnover

24:35.675 --> 24:37.075
and only one or two
entrances or exits.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.608
And each place has one object
almost everybody touches...

24:39.609 --> 24:41.149
The turnstile, the gas pump,

24:41.150 --> 24:42.851
the... the keyboard
on the a.T.M. Machine.

24:42.852 --> 24:45.153
One touch, maximum casualties.

24:45.154 --> 24:47.215
Maybe Dani and the
other nine were all

24:47.216 --> 24:49.217
at some
as-yet-unidentified cluster.

24:49.218 --> 24:52.090
With one exit and
minimal security.

24:52.091 --> 24:55.163
Let's look at the other
ten timelines again.

24:55.164 --> 24:57.866
(Megan) Why are you
bringing your cell phone?

24:57.867 --> 25:00.098
There is absolutely
nothing legal

25:00.099 --> 25:01.229
about what we are doing,

25:01.230 --> 25:02.771
so I want to be
sure to at least get

25:02.772 --> 25:04.102
a video consent from the patient

25:04.103 --> 25:05.574
before I administer anything.

25:05.575 --> 25:07.075
She'll give it.

25:07.076 --> 25:11.179
And I just want
to say thank you.

25:11.180 --> 25:13.011
I know I can be a pain.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.113
I'm not breaking pretty
much every rule there is

25:15.114 --> 25:18.717
just to get your harpy
claws out of my ass.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.689
You were right.

25:20.690 --> 25:22.020
This is probably
the only shot I have

25:22.021 --> 25:23.151
at getting a human trial

25:23.152 --> 25:25.694
against one of the deadliest
viruses on the planet.

25:25.695 --> 25:28.096
So...

25:28.097 --> 25:29.257
(Clicks buttons)

25:29.258 --> 25:30.629
(Beeps)

25:30.630 --> 25:31.960
Let's go virus hunting.

25:31.961 --> 25:35.064
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

25:50.680 --> 25:51.850
Kate.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.253
(Coughs)

25:59.228 --> 26:01.029
Megan?

26:01.030 --> 26:02.791
What are you doing here?

26:02.792 --> 26:03.962
I'm like marburg.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.794
I'm impossible to get rid of.

26:05.795 --> 26:06.795
(Chuckles)

26:06.796 --> 26:09.138
We're gonna try to change that.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.570
It's experimental.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.072
There's no guarantee
it's gonna work,

26:14.073 --> 26:16.946
but... I have to give it a shot.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.809
Thank you.

26:20.810 --> 26:22.150
Hey.

26:22.151 --> 26:24.583
What are girlfriends for?

26:26.656 --> 26:29.057
I, Marcel trevino,

26:29.058 --> 26:31.921
give you my consent
to do this test.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.262
Do it, doc.

26:34.263 --> 26:35.764
I give my consent.

26:35.765 --> 26:37.065
Wait.

26:37.066 --> 26:39.097
Hey. What are you doing?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.069
You said you
would give it to Kate.

26:40.070 --> 26:42.100
No, I specifically
didn't say that.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.803
Mr. Trevino's a much
better test subject.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.975
There's more of the
pathogen in his bloodstream.

26:46.976 --> 26:48.276
It'll be easier

26:48.277 --> 26:52.180
for the vaccine to recognize
the virus and neutralize it.

26:52.181 --> 26:55.143
Who the hell are you to
decide who lives or dies?

26:55.144 --> 26:57.145
Who are you?

26:57.146 --> 27:00.890
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:07.897 --> 27:15.735
Wow.

27:18.207 --> 27:21.310
(Panting)

27:25.875 --> 27:27.045
(Grunts)

27:27.046 --> 27:28.216
(Monitor emitting
continuous tone)

27:28.217 --> 27:29.178
(Woman) Flatline!

27:29.179 --> 27:30.979
(Man) Let's go! Let's go!

27:30.980 --> 27:33.651
(Woman shouts indistinctly)

27:33.652 --> 27:35.053
(Tone continues)

27:35.054 --> 27:36.124
(Man) I got 'em.

27:36.125 --> 27:40.158
(People speaking indistinctly)

27:40.159 --> 27:42.160
(Tone continues)

27:42.161 --> 27:44.163
(Man) Still dropping!

27:49.668 --> 27:52.841
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

27:52.842 --> 27:55.103
I almost gave you
an untested vaccine.

27:55.104 --> 27:57.746
I could've killed you.

27:57.747 --> 27:59.848
You wanted to help me.

27:59.849 --> 28:02.110
I can't tell you how much it
means to me that you tried.

28:02.111 --> 28:04.853
(Beeping continues)

28:04.854 --> 28:06.885
I just killed that man.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.317
Nobody killed anybody.

28:09.318 --> 28:11.319
He was dying. You
tried to save him.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.861
It didn't work.

28:12.862 --> 28:14.162
No, it didn't just not
work. It killed him.

28:14.163 --> 28:16.094
It was our best chance.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.966
(Beeping continues)

28:17.967 --> 28:20.698
Our last chance.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.170
(Beeping continues)

28:22.171 --> 28:24.072
I'm sorry.

28:24.073 --> 28:26.234
(Beeping continues)

28:26.235 --> 28:28.276
(Door hisses open)

28:28.277 --> 28:31.479
Look at me.

28:31.480 --> 28:35.944
I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told Curtis.

28:35.945 --> 28:37.946
The one place you're
not gonna catch this guy

28:37.947 --> 28:39.447
is sitting here holding my hand

28:39.448 --> 28:41.089
watching me die.

28:41.090 --> 28:43.752
No. I'm not leaving you.

28:43.753 --> 28:47.255
You have been a
truly good friend,

28:47.256 --> 28:48.827
which sounds odd,

28:48.828 --> 28:50.829
considering we've never
really seen eye-to-eye.

28:50.830 --> 28:55.203
But... if you really
want to be there for me,

28:55.204 --> 28:58.066
go catch this guy.

28:58.067 --> 29:01.210
Don't let him infect
even one more person.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.276
(Mouths word)

29:12.782 --> 29:15.785
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

29:21.190 --> 29:23.291
That's odd.

29:23.292 --> 29:24.894
What's odd?

29:26.135 --> 29:27.966
Trevino's liver.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.898
Trevino's dead?

29:29.899 --> 29:32.340
Four hours ago.
I tried to call you.

29:32.341 --> 29:33.972
Oh, I've been, uh,

29:33.973 --> 29:36.805
trying to piece
together Dani's timeline.

29:36.806 --> 29:38.306
Right. Your way.
How's that going?

29:38.307 --> 29:40.408
I know where she was
every hour of every day

29:40.409 --> 29:42.981
for her last 72 hours.

29:42.982 --> 29:43.953
That's great.

29:43.954 --> 29:45.113
All except for one hour

29:45.114 --> 29:47.385
on day one between
2:00 and 3:00 P.M.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.817
I know, I know.

29:48.818 --> 29:50.388
It's only an hour, but
it's unaccounted for.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.991
And so is where and how
she got this damn thing.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.163
Well, this is
where it all started,

29:55.164 --> 29:57.065
right here, at least for us,

29:57.066 --> 29:58.868
with those two.

30:01.470 --> 30:03.001
You know, he kept saying

30:03.002 --> 30:04.933
that he'd seen Dani
somewhere before.

30:04.934 --> 30:06.134
And at first, I thought

30:06.135 --> 30:07.876
it was just some
tired old pickup line,

30:07.877 --> 30:08.838
but what if it wasn't?

30:08.839 --> 30:10.508
They both have this disease,

30:10.509 --> 30:12.510
they're both outliers, they
met somewhere before,

30:12.511 --> 30:16.484
and she has an hour
missing in her timeline.

30:16.485 --> 30:19.287
Not in trevino's timeline.

30:19.288 --> 30:21.249
The FBI double-checked
it and reconfirmed it

30:21.250 --> 30:22.921
down to the millisecond.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.592
It's right there in his file.

30:24.593 --> 30:27.596
(People speaking indistinctly)

30:32.301 --> 30:33.461
2:30 to 3:00,

30:33.462 --> 30:37.165
he was on the number
24 crosstown bus.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.967
A bus...

30:38.968 --> 30:41.970
A high-volume place
with only one or two exits

30:41.971 --> 30:43.841
where people have to
touch the same thing.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.013
Didn't Dani drive a car?

30:45.014 --> 30:46.344
It was in the
shop all last week.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.046
This whole time, I've been
looking at where she went,

30:48.047 --> 30:49.217
not how she got there.

30:49.218 --> 30:51.881
She took the damn bus.

30:55.084 --> 30:56.454
(Johnson) So what
are we looking at?

30:56.455 --> 30:59.257
Security footage from
the number 24 bus.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.130
(Video playing without audio)

31:02.131 --> 31:04.132
That's one of our outliers.

31:04.133 --> 31:06.094
Yeah.

31:06.095 --> 31:09.097
There's Dani.

31:09.098 --> 31:12.070
(People speaking indistinctly)

31:12.071 --> 31:14.903
Marcel trevino.

31:14.904 --> 31:18.907
I count eight out
of our ten outliers.

31:18.908 --> 31:20.108
They all touched the railing.

31:20.109 --> 31:21.911
Yeah.

31:23.312 --> 31:25.413
The question is,
who touched it first?

31:25.414 --> 31:27.385
I gotta go all the
way back for that...

31:27.386 --> 31:28.556
(Clicks mouse)

31:28.557 --> 31:31.059
To the first
passenger of the day.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.591
(Click)

31:44.473 --> 31:46.105
(Click)

31:54.313 --> 31:57.415
His name is Jacob mount.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.388
He's got a bachelor's in
biochemistry from state.

32:00.389 --> 32:03.992
He was working on his degree
in population study at Oxford

32:03.993 --> 32:06.024
when he dropped off
the grid for eight months.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.025
Suddenly, he's back,

32:07.026 --> 32:09.627
applying for menial
jobs at the w.H.O.,

32:09.628 --> 32:12.930
the penn public health
laboratory, the c.D.C.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.602
Hey, don't look at me. We
didn't hire this assclown.

32:14.603 --> 32:16.264
Well, the w.H.O.
Did, as an intern

32:16.265 --> 32:19.007
in one of their facilities
in upstate Pennsylvania,

32:19.008 --> 32:23.711
the one that stores level 4
biohazardous viral strains,

32:23.712 --> 32:25.974
including our friends
ebola and marburg.

32:25.975 --> 32:28.316
He was fired six months ago

32:28.317 --> 32:30.578
evicted from his apartment
three months ago,

32:30.579 --> 32:32.950
current address...
(Clicks tongue) Unknown.

32:32.951 --> 32:37.185
So here's what we
know, ladies and gents...

32:37.186 --> 32:38.356
Who he is,

32:38.357 --> 32:39.687
where he's been,

32:39.688 --> 32:41.559
what he's spreading,

32:41.560 --> 32:44.362
and how he's spreading it.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.693
(Johnson) Here's
what we don't know...

32:45.694 --> 32:47.035
Where the hell he is now

32:47.036 --> 32:49.437
and what the hell
he's gonna do next.

32:49.438 --> 32:51.569
(Julie) As local law
enforcement remain mum

32:51.570 --> 32:54.142
about the progress
of the investigation,

32:54.143 --> 32:56.304
the average
philadelphian we talked to

32:56.305 --> 32:59.507
reels from shock to
fear to anger to sorrow,

32:59.508 --> 33:01.509
but all of them want to know,

33:01.510 --> 33:04.082
who is John q.
Plague... (Coughs)

33:04.083 --> 33:06.454
And where is he now?

33:06.455 --> 33:08.717
(Indistinct conversations)

33:11.690 --> 33:14.493
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

33:27.206 --> 33:28.376
(Johnson) A bank,

33:28.377 --> 33:29.537
a coffee shop, church,

33:29.538 --> 33:30.708
gas station,

33:30.709 --> 33:32.210
and now a bus.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.711
Seven clusters,

33:33.712 --> 33:36.114
seven very different targets,

33:36.115 --> 33:38.746
and mount hasn't
retraced his steps once.

33:38.747 --> 33:41.018
The question is,

33:41.019 --> 33:42.490
what's the next target?

33:42.491 --> 33:44.352
Spin me some scenarios.

33:44.353 --> 33:46.224
(All speaking at once)

33:46.225 --> 33:48.126
Excuse me.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.397
Hello!

33:49.398 --> 33:52.100
Actually, there are

33:52.101 --> 33:53.661
eight or nine clusters.

33:53.662 --> 33:56.464
Eight or nine? What are you
counting I'm not, Dr. Hunt?

33:56.465 --> 33:58.166
The two remaining outliers

33:58.167 --> 33:59.807
who were not on the bus...

33:59.808 --> 34:01.409
Viola marks and
Thomas highchurch.

34:01.410 --> 34:03.211
(Johnson) Uh, they
have nothing in common.

34:03.212 --> 34:05.213
Uh, yes, they do.

34:05.214 --> 34:06.244
Cimex lectularius.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.345
Excuse me?

34:07.346 --> 34:08.676
Bed bug bites.

34:08.677 --> 34:10.348
Uh, we've been looking
for commonalities

34:10.349 --> 34:11.679
among all the outliers,

34:11.680 --> 34:13.151
and there were
none among all ten,

34:13.152 --> 34:15.453
but those two both
had bed bug bites.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.325
(Ethan) Now they didn't
get marburg from those bites,

34:17.326 --> 34:18.656
but they did have them.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.259
There was an
infestation of bed bugs

34:21.260 --> 34:22.760
at the bingham hotel last week.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.163
Maybe our two
outliers stayed there.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.165
Maybe our killer did, too.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.197
Let's go.

34:31.140 --> 34:32.300
Dunlop.

34:32.301 --> 34:35.143
You're with us.

34:35.144 --> 34:37.545
(Clicks)

34:37.546 --> 34:40.148
(Man) FBI!

34:40.149 --> 34:43.211
(Man speaks indistinctly)

34:43.212 --> 34:44.452
(Man) Nobody here.

34:44.453 --> 34:46.384
Damn it! (Man) Clear.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.216
(Man) Bathroom's clear.

34:48.217 --> 34:50.218
Look, the desk clerk said he
was sick when he checked in.

34:50.219 --> 34:51.759
He's even sicker now.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.721
He doesn't have much time
left. He couldn't have gone far.

34:53.722 --> 34:55.293
(Johnson) Well, if
he's going out soon,

34:55.294 --> 34:56.624
he's going out big.

34:56.625 --> 34:58.326
But where?

34:58.327 --> 35:02.270
(Police radio chatter)

35:02.271 --> 35:05.304
(Indistinct conversations)

35:06.605 --> 35:07.735
He's gonna hit the school.

35:07.736 --> 35:09.238
You guys, with me!

35:12.281 --> 35:14.111
No, guys, wait, wait, wait.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.743
The elementary school
doesn't make any sense.

35:15.744 --> 35:17.415
That place has way too
many entrances and exits.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.217
It's not his m.O.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.149
Then he's not going there.

35:21.150 --> 35:23.421
But he doesn't have
much time, right?

35:23.422 --> 35:24.892
Okay, so...

35:24.893 --> 35:27.295
Where's he going?

35:27.296 --> 35:29.297
What does he need
in order to feed?

35:29.298 --> 35:31.229
One or two entrances,

35:31.230 --> 35:33.602
one touchstone,
maximum exposure.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.735
The only one that fits...

35:37.736 --> 35:39.208
The subway.

35:43.172 --> 35:44.912
(Groans)

35:44.913 --> 35:48.916
(Exhales)

35:48.917 --> 35:50.448
(Coughs)

35:50.449 --> 35:53.452
(Indistinct conversations)

36:00.589 --> 36:02.691
(Exhales deeply)

36:04.563 --> 36:05.863
Jacob mount!

36:05.864 --> 36:07.335
Freeze!

36:07.336 --> 36:09.267
(People shouting indistinctly)

36:09.268 --> 36:10.199
(Coughs)

36:10.200 --> 36:12.600
Ironic,

36:12.601 --> 36:15.273
'cause nothing
ever truly freezes...

36:15.274 --> 36:16.245
(Sam) Get out of here!

36:16.246 --> 36:17.445
Even when frozen.

36:17.446 --> 36:20.278
Life and death

36:20.279 --> 36:21.579
march on.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.712
Go ahead. Shoot.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.714
Help me splatter my blood

36:26.715 --> 36:29.387
over all these people.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.619
Help me

36:31.620 --> 36:32.960
cull this herd.

36:32.961 --> 36:34.392
I said freeze.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.893
(Laughs) Shoot.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.395
Shoot.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.796
We figured you'd plan
something like this.

36:38.797 --> 36:42.671
Don't move.

36:57.446 --> 37:00.449
(Sirens wailing)

37:08.797 --> 37:11.429
(Johnson) Nice working with you.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.431
Hopefully the next time,
things will go more smoothly.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.333
No next time. I just got fired.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.964
What? Why?

37:16.965 --> 37:18.866
I'll admit, your
charm is a bit limited,

37:18.867 --> 37:21.339
but you did just track
down a deadly virus.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.840
Yeah, and I...

37:22.841 --> 37:25.673
Stole a vaccine and
killed a man with it.

37:25.674 --> 37:28.316
Who was going to die anyway.

37:28.317 --> 37:30.348
Just because trevino
gave his verbal consent

37:30.349 --> 37:31.649
to be a test subject

37:31.650 --> 37:34.522
doesn't change the fact that
it was an untested vaccine

37:34.523 --> 37:35.853
that killed him.

37:35.854 --> 37:38.786
Actually...

37:38.787 --> 37:40.388
I don't think it did.

37:40.389 --> 37:41.729
(Sighs)

37:41.730 --> 37:44.592
Come with me. Now.

37:44.593 --> 37:46.594
Something about trevino's liver

37:46.595 --> 37:48.396
hasn't set right with me.

37:48.397 --> 37:49.637
Look, see.

37:49.638 --> 37:50.798
Focal liver cell necrosis.

37:50.799 --> 37:52.770
He had frickin' marburg, Megan.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.302
The marburg virus and
necrotic liver cells go together.

37:54.303 --> 37:56.604
But what if the marburg
was masking liver damage

37:56.605 --> 37:58.376
that was already present?

37:58.377 --> 38:00.047
Remember one of the drugs
he was taking... antabuse...

38:00.048 --> 38:02.350
Used to treat severe alcoholism?

38:02.351 --> 38:04.552
This guy shouldn't have
been anywhere near alcohol,

38:04.553 --> 38:06.754
but look at his tox screen.

38:06.755 --> 38:09.857
His blood alcohol was
.2. He was intoxicated.

38:09.858 --> 38:11.859
Somebody gave him a
drink in the last 24 hours,

38:11.860 --> 38:15.022
and his liver was so
damaged, he couldn't detoxify it.

38:15.023 --> 38:17.525
So your theory is that
a guy who was exposed

38:17.526 --> 38:19.397
to the deadliest
virus on the planet

38:19.398 --> 38:21.529
and shot with an
experimental medication

38:21.530 --> 38:23.771
actually died from a drink?

38:23.772 --> 38:24.932
Yes.

38:24.933 --> 38:27.506
Your vaccine could still work.

38:28.777 --> 38:30.378
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

38:30.379 --> 38:33.381
(Indistinct conversations)

38:33.382 --> 38:36.385
(Beeping continues)

39:03.412 --> 39:05.373
Welcome back, darling.

39:05.374 --> 39:09.077
(Chuckles)

39:57.766 --> 40:01.028
Mrs. Alvarez, I...

40:01.029 --> 40:02.701
I'm Peter...

40:04.803 --> 40:07.506
Dani's friend.

40:14.983 --> 40:17.846
Dani told me all about you.

40:40.008 --> 40:43.572
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

40:44.843 --> 40:46.544
Hey.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.576
You're looking a lot better.

40:48.577 --> 40:50.578
(Woman) Thank you, Dr. Stafford.

40:50.579 --> 40:52.219
(Beeping continues)

40:52.220 --> 40:54.852
Hey, Dr. Stafford.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.554
Or Charlie?

40:56.555 --> 40:58.556
What do I call you
after you saved my life?

40:58.557 --> 41:00.027
Call me staff.

41:00.028 --> 41:02.490
(Clears throat)
Like the infection?

41:02.491 --> 41:04.091
But cuter.

41:04.092 --> 41:05.863
(Laughs)

41:05.864 --> 41:08.866
Megan told me you got fired
'cause of what you did for us.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.669
I'm actually sad
about losing my lab.

41:11.670 --> 41:15.072
It took me ten years to
get the decor just right.

41:15.073 --> 41:18.606
Well, I doubt you'll be
unemployed for long, but...

41:18.607 --> 41:22.510
I do have a subbasement
at the m.E.O. Going unused.

41:22.511 --> 41:24.652
Are you propositioning me?

41:24.653 --> 41:26.584
Just temporarily,

41:26.585 --> 41:28.115
till your next job comes.

41:28.116 --> 41:29.486
(Chuckles)

41:29.487 --> 41:31.619
The space is available and maybe

41:31.620 --> 41:34.822
we get some free
lab work on the side?

41:34.823 --> 41:36.694
Well, you may regret that offer.

41:36.695 --> 41:40.267
It's, uh, it's said that I
don't play well with others.

41:40.268 --> 41:42.930
Have you met Megan hunt?

41:42.931 --> 41:44.533
(Laughs)

41:46.775 --> 41:49.677
(Julie) A city mourns.

41:49.678 --> 41:51.508
A city heals.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.581
Our home, brave Philadelphia,

41:53.582 --> 41:54.942
survives.

41:54.943 --> 41:56.684
We at channel 4
would like to thank

41:56.685 --> 41:58.716
the heroic members
of law enforcement,

41:58.717 --> 42:01.048
the FBI, and the c.D.C.
For all of their hard work...

42:01.049 --> 42:03.050
Hey, they didn't even
mention you, mom.

42:03.051 --> 42:04.592
How lame.

42:04.593 --> 42:06.994
I had a lot of help,
honey. I'm not a superhero.

42:06.995 --> 42:08.696
(Chuckles)

42:08.697 --> 42:10.628
Aidan called you,
like, a million times.

42:10.629 --> 42:13.000
He did? What did you tell him?

42:13.001 --> 42:15.032
That you were
out saving the city.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.604
(Laughs) Lacey.

42:16.605 --> 42:17.735
(Laughs) What?

42:17.736 --> 42:19.607
Someone's gotta sing
your praises around here.

42:19.608 --> 42:21.108
Good girl. (Laughs)

42:21.109 --> 42:22.269
What did he say?

42:22.270 --> 42:24.041
He said of course you
were saving the city

42:24.042 --> 42:26.714
and just to call him back
when you were done.

42:26.715 --> 42:29.918
(Kisses)
