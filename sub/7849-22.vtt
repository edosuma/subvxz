ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO!

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
NOW--

09:05.400 --> 09:08.800
WHO'S READY
FOR SOME ACTING EXERCISES?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.734
ACTUALLY, I'D LIKE
TO DISCUSS THE THEME
OF THE PLAY--

09:10.734 --> 09:11.967
GREAT IDEA!
OH.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.800

LET'S DO SOME
MIRRORING EXERCISES, OK?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.834

AND THEN FACE THEM.

09:17.834 --> 09:18.734
BUT--
BUT.

09:18.734 --> 09:19.867
NO, I'D LIKE TO--
NO, I'D LIKE TO.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.200
COULD WE JUST--

09:21.200 --> 09:22.800
OOH.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.667
HEY, ZACK,
LET'S BE PARTNERS.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.600
HEY, GWEN.
LET'S BE PARTNERS.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.200
YOU NEED
TO QUIT THE PLAY.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.400
WHAT? NO WAY!

09:35.400 --> 09:37.834
BUT LYSANDER
AND HERMIA KISS.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.867
I FORBID YOU
TO KISS GWEN.

09:39.867 --> 09:41.800
I WON'T BE
KISSING GWEN.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.300
MY CHARACTER WILL BE
KISSING HER CHARACTER.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.400
OH, YEAH?

09:46.400 --> 09:49.500
WELL, MY CHARACTER
WILL BE PUNCHING
YOUR CHARACTER OUT.

GWEN, YOU SEEM LIKE
A LOVELY GIRL.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.367
AND I WOULD HATE
TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

09:59.367 --> 10:00.300
WHY WOULD I GET HURT?

10:00.300 --> 10:03.233
'CAUSE IF YOUR
STAGE KISS WITH ZACK

10:03.233 --> 10:05.000

10:17.400 --> 10:20.200
JUST KEEP THE KISSING
TO A MINIMUM.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.734
OK, ZACK.

10:21.734 --> 10:22.700

WITH THE SCENE

10:24.600 --> 10:26.934
WHERE HERMIA
AND LYSANDER
DECIDE TO ELOPE.

10:26.934 --> 10:28.200
AND REMEMBER,
THIS IS THE PLAY

10:28.200 --> 10:29.900
WHERE EVERYONE
FALLS IN LOVE WITH
THE WRONG PERSON

10:29.900 --> 10:31.567
BECAUSE THEY'VE
BEEN BEWITCHED
BY THE FAIRY PUCK,

10:31.567 --> 10:34.200
BUT IN THE END, TRUE
LOVE CONQUERS ALL. HA!

10:35.500 --> 10:39.200
UH, I JUST WANTED
TO GET THE THEME IN.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.400
OK, IF WE'RE ALL THROUGH.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.133
START THERE.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.934
IF THOU
LOVEST ME, THEN--

10:47.934 --> 10:50.300
OK, GOOD.
I'M GONNA STOP YOU.

OH! SORRY.
OK.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.300
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN

10:58.300 --> 11:00.200
AND THIS TIME, I WANT
TO FEEL THE EMOTION.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.767
NOW, LOOK INTO EACH
OTHER'S EYES.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.400

WHAT YOU REALLY FEEL.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.800
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

11:46.800 --> 11:47.867
AND IT MIGHT BE
A GOOD IDEA

11:47.867 --> 11:49.567
IF WE SEE
OTHER PEOPLE.
