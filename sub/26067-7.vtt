<i>Previously on The Truth About</i>
<i>the Harry Quebert Affair...</i>

00:06.621 --> 00:07.562
Oh, wow, what is this?

00:07.662 --> 00:09.043
It's for putting
dry bread in,

00:09.143 --> 00:10.405
so you can feed
the seagulls.

00:10.505 --> 00:11.766
Tell me I'm your...

00:11.866 --> 00:13.007
your darling Nola.

00:13.107 --> 00:14.609
You're my darling Nola.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.711
Crime scene photos.

00:17.512 --> 00:21.576
What is on the first page
of this goddamn manuscript?

00:21.676 --> 00:23.177
This is not my writing.

00:23.277 --> 00:24.418
If you didn't
write this,

00:24.518 --> 00:26.380
who the fuck did?

00:26.480 --> 00:28.142
I can't stay here.

00:28.242 --> 00:29.623
I can't afford this house.

00:29.723 --> 00:30.544
We'll find us a way.

00:30.644 --> 00:31.625
We'll find it.

00:31.725 --> 00:32.907
It doesn't matter,
we'll make it work.

00:33.007 --> 00:34.789
We always make it work.

00:34.889 --> 00:36.890
Don't you love me?

00:38.212 --> 00:39.753
Yes.

00:39.853 --> 00:41.755
That's all that matters.

00:41.855 --> 00:44.038
Harry didn't kill that girl,
I know it.

00:44.138 --> 00:45.519
[Gahalowood]:
Because he's your friend?

00:45.619 --> 00:46.700
[Marcus]: Because there's
someone out there

00:46.780 --> 00:48.162
who doesn't want me
to figure out who did.

00:48.262 --> 00:50.264
[glass shattering]

00:51.425 --> 00:52.886
[Marcus]:
Harry was waiting for her

00:52.986 --> 00:54.848
at the By The Sea Motel
in Room 8, okay?

00:54.948 --> 00:56.169
He said Nola
had sent him a letter

00:56.269 --> 00:57.210
saying that
she'd meet him there,

00:57.310 --> 00:58.572
but she never showed up.

00:58.672 --> 01:01.414
The path through the forest
goes to the beach.

01:01.514 --> 01:04.658
Someone's beating you
again, aren't they?

01:04.758 --> 01:06.820
Yes, for disappearing
for a week.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.981
That's when she told me

01:08.081 --> 01:10.223
about her being in love
with an older man.

01:10.323 --> 01:11.664
Didn't name names,

01:11.764 --> 01:13.386
but I was sure it was Stern.

01:13.486 --> 01:17.070
My former chauffeur,
Luther Caleb, painted it.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.511
I have witnesses
who will testify

01:18.611 --> 01:19.472
that you two

01:19.572 --> 01:21.914
were actually
in a relationship.

01:22.014 --> 01:23.876
<i>The results are in, Goldman...</i>

01:23.976 --> 01:25.198
The handwriting isn't Harry's.

01:25.298 --> 01:27.600
He didn't write the note
on that goddamn manuscript.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.442
<i>I mean, that was their main</i>
<i>piece of evidence.</i>

01:29.542 --> 01:31.364
Why didn't you carry
out the investigation

01:31.464 --> 01:32.445
like you should have?

01:32.545 --> 01:35.748
That girl knew exactly
what she was doing.

01:36.909 --> 01:37.890
Nola...

01:37.990 --> 01:39.992
Now you're a criminal.

01:40.673 --> 01:42.334
<i>[Marcus]:</i>
<i>It's the first 50 pages.</i>

01:42.434 --> 01:44.977
You know, it's rough, you know,
it's just notes, really.

01:45.077 --> 01:47.299
Go ahead, give us all those
sordid, juicy details

01:47.399 --> 01:49.101
about how she went down on him,

01:49.201 --> 01:51.984
and then he forced her
to go down on him again.

01:52.084 --> 01:53.345
Where are you taking me?

01:53.445 --> 01:54.626
[unzipping]

01:54.726 --> 01:55.627
[Maggie Pratt]:
Detective, wh--?

01:55.727 --> 01:57.709
Where are they taking
my husband?

01:57.809 --> 01:59.811
What did you do?
Tell me!

02:01.012 --> 02:03.115
I have some devastating news.

02:03.215 --> 02:04.596
<i>I've been hacked.</i>

02:04.696 --> 02:06.638
<i>Those 50 pages of notes</i>
<i>you e-mailed me,</i>

02:06.738 --> 02:08.560
leaked to every major
news outlet

02:08.660 --> 02:09.721
all over the country.

02:09.821 --> 02:10.602
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

02:10.702 --> 02:12.804
Roy? You have to
stop them, okay?

02:12.904 --> 02:14.766
<i>It's too late. By tomorrow,</i>

02:14.866 --> 02:16.868
this will be
all anybody's talking about.

02:22.113 --> 02:24.916
[âªâªâªâªâª]

03:38.868 --> 03:39.929
[Marcus]: They make it sound

03:40.029 --> 03:42.091
like Nola was sleeping
with the whole town!

03:42.191 --> 03:43.452
<i>[Doug]: If it barks,</i>
<i>it's probably a dog, okay?</i>

03:43.552 --> 03:44.774
<i>Facts are just facts.</i>

03:44.874 --> 03:46.696
Yeah, not when they're
taken out of context.

03:46.796 --> 03:48.417
They printed my notes, Doug.

03:48.517 --> 03:50.499
Okay, I was writing something,

03:50.599 --> 03:52.501
something human,
and... and personal,

03:52.601 --> 03:53.582
and they made it sound--

03:53.682 --> 03:54.663
<i>Better?</i>

03:54.763 --> 03:57.106
No, I'm-- No,
I'm serious, man, okay?

03:57.206 --> 03:58.547
You're my agent.

03:58.647 --> 04:01.690
We need to do something
to restore my credibility here.

04:04.893 --> 04:07.796
[hum of conversations]

04:07.896 --> 04:09.898
[silence falls]

04:11.820 --> 04:13.822
Morning.

04:17.065 --> 04:19.488
"Jenny Dawn,
formerly Jenny Quinn...

04:19.588 --> 04:20.569
Shit.

04:20.669 --> 04:22.611
...the current owner
of Clark's Diner,

04:22.711 --> 04:23.852
still carries a torch
for Quebert...

04:23.952 --> 04:25.133
Yeah.

04:25.233 --> 04:28.536
an intense infatuation
that's lasted 33 years

04:28.636 --> 04:30.819
despite his total
lack of interest."

04:30.919 --> 04:31.860
Yes. These
were notes, Jenny,

04:31.960 --> 04:33.061
and they were not meant
for publication.

04:33.161 --> 04:36.024
It's in every goddamn
newspaper in the country!

04:36.124 --> 04:38.626
I have a husband,
Marcus,

04:38.726 --> 04:40.028
family, friends.

04:40.128 --> 04:41.309
Did you ever
think of that?

04:41.409 --> 04:43.431
I'm-- Jenny,
I'm very sorry, okay?

04:43.531 --> 04:44.912
Sorry excuse
for a friend,

04:45.012 --> 04:46.314
I can tell you
that much.

04:46.414 --> 04:47.635
I didn't spend hours

04:47.735 --> 04:48.996
giving you information
about Sommerdale

04:49.096 --> 04:51.879
so you could turn it into
Freaktown, USA!

04:51.979 --> 04:52.800
Ernie, Ernie, my notes...

04:52.900 --> 04:54.041
my notes
were leaked, okay?

04:54.141 --> 04:55.362
I swear to God,
none of this...

04:55.462 --> 04:57.885
none of this was ever supposed
to end up in print!

04:57.985 --> 04:59.086
Listen, if there's
anything I can do

04:59.186 --> 04:59.967
to make it up to you--

05:00.067 --> 05:01.488
There is, actually.

05:01.588 --> 05:04.511
You can find
somewhere else to eat.

05:26.172 --> 05:27.874
You should be happy.

05:27.974 --> 05:28.955
Your dirty book's the reason

05:29.055 --> 05:31.197
that Harry is getting
released on bail.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.639
<i>Aren't you giving me</i>
<i>a little too much credit?</i>

05:32.739 --> 05:34.881
The handwriting analysis alone
would have gotten him off.

05:34.981 --> 05:36.122
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

05:36.222 --> 05:38.845
That was the sundae,
this is the cherry on top.

05:38.945 --> 05:40.406
I mean, turning Nola
into a gold-digging hooker,

05:40.506 --> 05:41.487
that's genius.

05:41.587 --> 05:43.329
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I never said that.

05:43.429 --> 05:44.570
Was Nola Kellergan
really--?

05:44.670 --> 05:45.451
Excuse me,
just a minute.

05:45.551 --> 05:46.492
Excuse me,
Mr. Roth.

05:46.592 --> 05:47.493
Look, look, look,
just stay tuned--

05:47.593 --> 05:48.734
Was Nola Kellergan
really seeing--?

05:48.834 --> 05:50.776
Excuse me, just a minute.
Just stay tuned to CNN--

05:50.876 --> 05:51.737
Mr. Roth!

05:51.837 --> 05:52.939
Would you wait
a minute, please?

05:53.039 --> 05:54.060
Can you wait?

05:54.160 --> 05:55.221
I'm on the phone!
Do you notice?

05:55.321 --> 05:56.422
Right, sir.
Right you are.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.864
So within the hour,
the DA is gonna come out,

05:58.964 --> 06:01.427
and he's gonna take a huge dump
in front of the public.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.149
You don't want to miss it.

06:03.249 --> 06:04.390
All right,
now please, go ahead.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.472
Was Nola Kellergan really
seeing multiple men?

06:06.572 --> 06:08.033
Of course she was. Yes.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.515
Is the murder
investigation

06:09.615 --> 06:10.235
back to square one?

06:10.335 --> 06:11.797
-Of course it is.
-It is?

06:11.897 --> 06:14.640
It is! It is...

06:14.740 --> 06:16.001
-Mr. Roth! Mr. Roth!
-Yes, ma'am.

06:16.101 --> 06:17.603
Do you know
who the killer is?

06:17.703 --> 06:20.045
I know who
the killer isn't.

06:31.196 --> 06:32.417
Hi there.

Hi.

06:54.779 --> 06:56.080
Uh, just the scrambled eggs,

06:56.180 --> 06:57.762
and a side
of hash browns, please.

06:57.862 --> 06:59.483
-Right away.
-And some coffee.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.005
Of course.
Thank you.

07:01.105 --> 07:03.247
Hey!

07:03.347 --> 07:04.148
The coffee's
better at Clark's,

07:04.228 --> 07:06.230
don't you think?

07:08.152 --> 07:10.154
Uh...

07:13.557 --> 07:15.579
But sleaze peddlers
and pedophiles' wives

07:15.679 --> 07:17.961
can't be too choosy, can we?

07:21.925 --> 07:23.307
Mrs. Pratt.

07:23.407 --> 07:26.630
Maggie. Please.

07:26.730 --> 07:28.732
Yeah.

07:33.056 --> 07:34.317
So, they throw you
out of Clark's?

07:34.417 --> 07:37.160
What, me? No. No.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.242
Well...

07:39.342 --> 07:41.324
kind of.

07:41.424 --> 07:43.426
How are you, uh,
how are you holding up?

07:44.868 --> 07:47.610
Gareth is staying
at the Montburry Motel

07:47.710 --> 07:48.892
since his release.

They informed
everyone in town

07:50.593 --> 07:52.175
there's a registered
sex offender

07:52.275 --> 07:54.097
in their midst.

07:54.197 --> 07:56.299
Of course, by now
the chief's old news.

07:56.399 --> 07:58.261
Your tawdry exposÃ©
this morning

07:58.361 --> 08:00.903
was just a little post-it
to remind them.

08:01.003 --> 08:03.506
Those pages were stolen, okay?

08:03.606 --> 08:05.147
Good.

08:05.247 --> 08:07.710
People should know
what happened,

08:07.810 --> 08:09.812
what Gareth did.

08:11.453 --> 08:12.435
Look, you know,

08:12.535 --> 08:13.916
maybe you shouldn't be alone
right now.

08:14.016 --> 08:15.918
Are you...

08:16.018 --> 08:19.481
Are there friends you can
turn to for support, or...?

08:19.581 --> 08:22.805
You know what
my support system is saying?

08:22.905 --> 08:25.888
That Gareth did what he did
because I couldn't satisfy him.

08:25.988 --> 08:27.049
Hey, nobody blames you.

08:27.149 --> 08:28.250
Of course
they do.

08:28.350 --> 08:31.393
It's always the wife's fault.

08:32.914 --> 08:34.496
I spent 40 years of my life

08:34.596 --> 08:37.038
with a man who lied to me
for 33 of them.

08:39.761 --> 08:41.263
So why do I still
set a place for him

11:43.941 --> 11:45.242

Uh-huh.
You know, Sergeant,

Excuse me.

No, because you're white.

that swollen head of yours.

About you never start a book

can happen afterwards.

22:55.955 --> 22:58.578
[speech impediment]
The nail was the problem.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.501
Ah, I see.

23:01.601 --> 23:05.625
May I ask...

23:05.725 --> 23:07.747
what happened
to your face?

23:07.847 --> 23:10.590
I had an accident.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.092
I'm so sorry.

23:14.934 --> 23:17.356
I happen to run
a transport company,

23:17.456 --> 23:20.239
and have a fair
number of cars.

23:20.339 --> 23:23.983
You wouldn't by any chance
be interested in a job?

23:29.228 --> 23:32.251
It's yours if you want it.

23:32.351 --> 23:35.434
<i>[Sylla]: That visitor</i>
<i>was Elijah Stern.</i>

23:37.636 --> 23:40.839
<i>And thanks to him,</i>
<i>Luther became someone again.</i>

23:43.041 --> 23:44.183
<i>Having a job</i>

23:44.283 --> 23:46.445
<i>put meaning back</i>
<i>into Luther's life.</i>

23:52.050 --> 23:53.872
[Sylla]: I kept all
his belongings down here,

23:53.972 --> 23:55.974
if you'd like to see them.

23:59.618 --> 24:01.560
[Marcus]: These were
all his paintings?

24:01.660 --> 24:03.161
Yeah, that's what
he loved to do.

24:03.261 --> 24:05.643
That's Eleanore.

24:05.743 --> 24:07.886
[Marcus]: Oh, God,
she looks like Nola.

24:07.986 --> 24:09.808
Yeah.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.529
Your brother, he, uh...

24:11.629 --> 24:13.531
he had a thing for blondes?

24:13.631 --> 24:15.253
Yeah, because
of Eleanore.

24:15.353 --> 24:17.535
A way to hold on to
what he'd lost.

24:17.635 --> 24:19.817
After his accident,

24:19.917 --> 24:22.780
Luther became a little
strange with women.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.863
They didn't always know
he was drawing them.

24:25.963 --> 24:27.064
My father was certain

24:27.164 --> 24:29.066
that something
must have happened

24:29.166 --> 24:32.109
between him
and that girl, Nola.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.792
Luther had mentioned
her name to him,

24:34.892 --> 24:36.554
and that...

24:36.654 --> 24:38.656
he was in love with her.

24:46.143 --> 24:48.145
These, uh...

24:50.988 --> 24:52.769
Is this Luther's handwriting?

24:52.869 --> 24:55.292
His instructions
for pruning roses.

24:55.392 --> 24:57.794
You can keep it
if it'll help you.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.722
That's it.

25:06.723 --> 25:08.945
[Interviewer]:
So in your mind,

25:09.045 --> 25:12.268
this Nola was
a manipulative seductress,

25:12.368 --> 25:14.310
and that would make
Harry Quebert...?

25:14.410 --> 25:16.673
The real victim.
Yes.

25:16.773 --> 25:18.074
But that's ridiculous.

25:18.174 --> 25:19.716
She was only 15.

25:19.816 --> 25:21.157
You make it sound like

25:21.257 --> 25:23.359
she seduced half the men
in Sommerdale.

25:23.459 --> 25:25.641
That's only because I'm not sure
about the other half.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.323
[chuckling]

25:27.423 --> 25:30.726
[cell phone rings]

25:30.826 --> 25:32.088
Roth. Go.

25:32.188 --> 25:33.930
Hey! [laughs]

25:34.030 --> 25:35.851
Yeah, uh, were you watching?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.373
I crushed it, right?

25:37.473 --> 25:38.654
<i>You're disgusting, Roth.</i>

25:38.754 --> 25:40.816
You drag everyone's name
through the mud like that.

25:40.916 --> 25:43.579
<i>Look, I'm just</i>
<i>doing my job, Goldman.</i>

25:43.679 --> 25:45.501
I mean, the only way
I can clear Harry's name

25:45.601 --> 25:49.625
is by making everybody else
seem more repulsive than he is.

25:49.725 --> 25:51.146
<i>Let us not forget</i>

25:51.246 --> 25:53.789
<i>your book is doing</i>
<i>a bang-up job of that as well.</i>

25:53.889 --> 25:55.891
[hanging up]
-Asshole.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.935
[turns off TV]

26:03.418 --> 26:05.400
I'm not blaming you, Marcus,

26:05.500 --> 26:07.562
and I already knew about
Jenny's crush on Quebert.

26:07.662 --> 26:09.364
Okay.

26:09.464 --> 26:12.007
Now, you said there was
something you needed to discuss?

26:12.107 --> 26:13.288
Yeah, um,

26:13.388 --> 26:15.250
we got some new information
about Luther Caleb.

26:15.350 --> 26:16.891
Okay.

26:16.991 --> 26:19.654
[Perry]: We found
a portrait of Nola

26:19.754 --> 26:22.137
that he painted
at Elijah Stern's house.

26:22.237 --> 26:24.859
Um, apparently, she was
a frequent guest there.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.622
Yeah, I read
about that.

26:27.722 --> 26:29.984
I understand, um, he had
a harassment complaint

26:30.084 --> 26:31.906
filed against him.

26:32.006 --> 26:33.748
He was a weird guy.

26:33.848 --> 26:35.950
I don't know
how dangerous he was,

26:36.050 --> 26:38.553
but one time he got
aggressive with Jenny.

26:38.653 --> 26:39.914
Grabbed her hard, bruised her.

26:40.014 --> 26:42.596
And why wasn't he investigated
as a serious suspect?

26:42.696 --> 26:44.118
Well, he didn't drive
a black Monte Carlo,

26:44.218 --> 26:45.679
for one thing.

26:45.779 --> 26:48.042
And there was
no obvious connection

26:48.142 --> 26:49.643
between him and Nola
at the time...

26:49.743 --> 26:51.005
Mm-hmm.

26:51.105 --> 26:53.607
Plus, he, uh...

26:53.707 --> 26:56.010
he left town
before she even disappeared.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.091
Are you sure?

26:57.191 --> 26:59.133
Yeah, I'm sure.

26:59.233 --> 27:02.376
I, uh...
[clears throat]

27:02.476 --> 27:05.979
I saw him a couple days
before Nola disappeared,

27:06.079 --> 27:07.461
and he...

27:07.561 --> 27:10.103
he knew he wasn't supposed
to hang around Sommerdale,

27:10.203 --> 27:14.307
so when I saw him driving
on Shore Road, I, uh...

27:14.407 --> 27:16.409
I pulled him over.

27:18.091 --> 27:20.393
Look, uh...

27:20.493 --> 27:23.877
I'm not proud of this,
but I just, uh...

27:23.977 --> 27:25.318
I lost it.

27:25.418 --> 27:27.320
[blows thud]

27:27.420 --> 27:29.422
Please...

27:31.984 --> 27:33.086
If I ever see you

27:33.186 --> 27:34.147
prowling around
Sommerdale again,

27:34.227 --> 27:35.408
I don't care why,

27:35.508 --> 27:38.851
your dick is gonna wish
it looked like your face.

27:38.951 --> 27:40.953
Clear?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.778
You think he listened to you?

27:45.878 --> 27:47.940
I never heard from him again.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.383
Till about a month later

27:50.483 --> 27:51.944
when I got the report

27:52.044 --> 27:54.787
that he'd died
in an auto accident.

27:54.887 --> 27:56.388
Somewhere in Maine, I think.

27:56.488 --> 27:57.509
Uh-huh,
well, still,

27:57.609 --> 27:59.191
it's possible
that he could have hid out

27:59.291 --> 28:01.633
without you knowing, right?

28:01.733 --> 28:03.115
I mean, he knew the area.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.216
If he didn't
want to be seen, he could've--

28:04.296 --> 28:05.437
I doubt it.

28:05.537 --> 28:07.639
People were flooding into town
to help search,

28:07.739 --> 28:10.122
you know, strangers canvassing,
teams of dogs,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.124
and no one ever
reported seeing Luther,

28:12.224 --> 28:14.966
and I'd have heard
about it, believe me.

28:15.066 --> 28:18.470
Those were pretty dark times,
I'm telling you.

28:27.479 --> 28:29.901
How's the search going, Travis?

28:30.001 --> 28:32.544
Um, haven't found
anything yet, Mrs. Quinn.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.425
It's pretty depressing.

28:34.525 --> 28:36.828
What about Harry Quebert?

28:36.928 --> 28:37.989
Is he a suspect?

28:38.089 --> 28:39.070
'Cause he should be.

28:39.170 --> 28:42.754
That's a serious
accusation, Mrs. Quinn.

28:42.854 --> 28:44.515
Unless you have
some hard evidence.

28:44.615 --> 28:47.999
Evidence, right.

28:48.099 --> 28:49.720
The truth can go to hell
without hard evidence.

28:49.820 --> 28:53.104
What a world.

28:54.345 --> 28:56.527
Have you eaten yet, Travis?

28:56.627 --> 28:58.669
Um, actually...

29:00.351 --> 29:02.132
I'll just go see
if Jenny's back.

29:02.232 --> 29:04.234
Thank you.

29:07.838 --> 29:08.939
Jenny?

29:09.039 --> 29:09.940
She's upstairs.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.042
Oh, okay.

29:13.443 --> 29:15.105
Sweetie pie?

29:15.205 --> 29:16.827
[Jenny]: Hi.

29:16.927 --> 29:18.869
Travis Dawn
is downstairs.

29:18.969 --> 29:20.951
He's such a nice boy.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.553
He's not bad looking
in the right light.

29:23.653 --> 29:25.755
You know, I was thinking, like,

29:25.855 --> 29:28.398
why don't you invite him
to lunch with us on Sunday?

29:28.498 --> 29:29.319
Mom...

29:29.419 --> 29:31.281
he's not my type.

29:31.381 --> 29:32.882
I know
what your type is,

29:32.982 --> 29:35.565
and Harry Quebert
is not a nice man.

29:35.665 --> 29:37.407
There's no future
between the two of you,

29:37.507 --> 29:39.849
believe me.

29:39.949 --> 29:42.372
Now, we're having lunch
with Travis on Sunday,

29:42.472 --> 29:46.215
and you're gonna love it.

29:46.315 --> 29:49.739
Now, go downstairs
and thank him for the flowers,

29:49.839 --> 29:51.060
and try not to mention
they're dead.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.461
It's the thought
that counts.

29:52.561 --> 29:53.502
Oh, great.

29:53.602 --> 29:55.604
Come on,
break time's over.

29:59.248 --> 30:02.011
[gulls cry]

30:34.562 --> 30:36.564
Ernie?

30:36.925 --> 30:38.306
Hey.

30:38.406 --> 30:40.348
Uh...

30:40.448 --> 30:41.790
What are you
doing here?

30:41.890 --> 30:43.952
I shouldn't have said
those things to you.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.875
I had no idea you were
receiving threats.

30:46.975 --> 30:47.875
Yeah.

30:47.975 --> 30:49.977
And-and that you
didn't leave.

30:52.300 --> 30:55.443
You're an exceptional
person, Marcus.

30:55.543 --> 30:58.206
People are gonna remember you.

30:58.306 --> 30:59.207
Thank you, Ernie.

30:59.307 --> 31:00.648
Thanks, man.
You... you too.

31:00.748 --> 31:02.129
[laughing] No. Ha ha!

31:02.229 --> 31:04.532
Nobody's gonna remember
Ernie Pinkas.

31:04.632 --> 31:07.294
I had my chance,
though.

31:07.394 --> 31:09.256
Yup...

31:09.356 --> 31:11.899
When Harry was
writing his book,

31:11.999 --> 31:14.181
he promised to put me
in the acknowledgements.

31:14.281 --> 31:14.942
Oh, is that right?

31:15.042 --> 31:15.943
Yeah.

31:16.043 --> 31:17.985
"First name on the list,"
he said.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.666
[chuckles ruefully]

31:19.766 --> 31:23.991
Promises are a cheap thing
to some people.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.713
You know?

31:26.813 --> 31:30.237
Well, take care,
Marcus.

31:30.337 --> 31:33.740
Again, sorry
for what I said.

31:47.153 --> 31:50.296
How's your investigation
coming along?

31:50.396 --> 31:53.940
I found this
at Goose Cove.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.042
And these.

31:57.443 --> 31:58.745
In case you felt like
clobbering something

31:58.845 --> 32:00.846
besides your shadow.

32:10.376 --> 32:12.878
I love you like a son,
and I always will,

32:12.978 --> 32:14.980
but our relationship is over.

32:18.063 --> 32:18.964
I don't understand.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.125
I know you don't.

32:20.225 --> 32:22.087
But when you do,
it's all gonna be different.

32:22.187 --> 32:23.248
What?

32:23.348 --> 32:24.730
Would you stop talking
in goddamn riddles?

32:24.830 --> 32:26.832
What is...?
What are you hiding?

32:28.193 --> 32:30.195
Shit!

32:45.370 --> 32:47.372
[gasping]

32:47.812 --> 32:49.814
Let me see.

32:55.460 --> 32:58.243
I've given you
everything.

32:58.343 --> 33:02.126
The truth
is in your hands.

33:02.226 --> 33:03.408
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

33:03.508 --> 33:07.011
This is "The Origin Of Evil,"

33:07.111 --> 33:10.594
a moment I've been dreading
for 33 years.

33:14.558 --> 33:16.560
[undoing gloves]

33:20.204 --> 33:22.526
[cell phone rings]

33:27.931 --> 33:29.933
[sighs]

33:31.495 --> 33:33.117
Hey, Mom, can I call you later?

33:33.217 --> 33:34.758
<i>Sweetie, there's a headline</i>
<i>in the Times</i>

33:34.858 --> 33:37.641
that says
someone wants you dead.

33:37.741 --> 33:38.682
Should we be worried?

33:38.782 --> 33:39.603
<i>No, no, no.</i>

33:39.703 --> 33:40.524
That's just my publisher

33:40.624 --> 33:42.846
trying to drum up
publicity, okay?

33:42.946 --> 33:44.087
<i>Listen...</i>

33:44.187 --> 33:46.810
your father and I think
you should get a gun.

33:46.910 --> 33:48.371
They are very easy
to get in Maine,

33:48.471 --> 33:49.372
from what I understand.

33:49.472 --> 33:50.774
<i>Everyone has one.</i>

33:50.874 --> 33:52.976
Mom, I'm not gonna
get a gun, okay?

33:53.076 --> 33:54.177
[door opens]
Got you a coffee.

33:54.277 --> 33:56.139
<i>Who's that?</i>

33:56.239 --> 33:56.860
It's no one, Ma.

33:56.960 --> 33:57.981
Hi, Mrs. Goldman.

33:58.081 --> 34:00.703
<i>Hello.</i>

34:00.803 --> 34:02.385
<i>Look, sweetie,</i>

34:02.485 --> 34:04.227
I'm not gonna pry,

34:04.327 --> 34:06.469
your love life is your own.

34:06.569 --> 34:09.112
<i>I just hope he's big</i>
<i>and can protect you.</i>

34:09.212 --> 34:12.475
I'm real big, Mrs. Goldman.

34:12.575 --> 34:13.876
Mom, let me just
call you later, okay?

34:13.976 --> 34:15.238
I love you.

34:15.338 --> 34:16.759
Could you not
with my mother on the phone?

34:16.859 --> 34:18.861
I already like her better
than my real mother-in-law.

34:20.102 --> 34:21.564
Guess who I went
to see last night.

34:21.664 --> 34:24.407
Last night? Um...

34:24.507 --> 34:27.089
Elijah Stern without me?

34:27.189 --> 34:30.212
You're getting
better at this.

34:30.312 --> 34:34.216
[rings doorbell]

34:34.316 --> 34:36.318
[knocking]

34:42.204 --> 34:44.066
Hey.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.787
Hey, um...

34:45.887 --> 34:47.269
I'm looking for...

34:47.369 --> 34:48.630
Elijah?

34:48.730 --> 34:50.472
Yes.

34:50.572 --> 34:52.574
I'll get him.

34:53.735 --> 34:55.737
Eli!

34:56.578 --> 34:58.580
You got a visitor.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.429
I guess I'll
take a shower.

35:10.952 --> 35:12.774
Good evening, Sergeant.

35:12.874 --> 35:15.817
Come in.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.418
Oh, my God, Stern's gay.

35:17.518 --> 35:19.100
Mm-hm.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.622
Said they've been
together 28 years.

35:21.722 --> 35:23.224
Then what the hell was
going on between him and Nola?

35:23.324 --> 35:25.786
Aw, gee, man, good question.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.828
Should have asked that.

35:27.928 --> 35:29.270
<i>As I told you,</i>

35:29.370 --> 35:32.713
it was purely
a business arrangement.

35:32.813 --> 35:34.815
Meaning?

35:35.616 --> 35:39.239
One evening that summer,
it must have been July,

35:39.339 --> 35:41.602
she rang my doorbell.

35:41.702 --> 35:46.446
He's writing a wonderful book,
a masterpiece,

35:46.546 --> 35:48.729
but if he has to move out now,
he'll never finish it,

35:48.829 --> 35:51.311
and that would be
such a waste.

35:52.793 --> 35:54.915
You can't control
who you love, Mr. Stern.

35:56.877 --> 35:58.258
And what do you want from me,

35:58.358 --> 36:00.740
Miss Kellergan?

36:00.840 --> 36:03.103
I want you to hire me.

36:03.203 --> 36:04.744
Let me work for you
for as long as it takes,

36:04.844 --> 36:06.266
so Harry can stay in Goose Cove.

36:06.366 --> 36:09.989
Confidentially,
of course.

36:10.089 --> 36:11.871
[sighs]

36:11.971 --> 36:14.674
I already have
enough employees.

36:14.774 --> 36:17.657
I'll do anything.

36:20.259 --> 36:22.542
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

36:34.393 --> 36:37.576
[whispering] Eli, please?

36:37.676 --> 36:38.617
Could I, please--

36:38.717 --> 36:40.139
Luther, no.
Not again--

36:40.239 --> 36:41.300
Please, please, please!

36:41.400 --> 36:43.402
She looks like
Eleanore.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.464
Eleanore?

36:45.564 --> 36:47.926
Yes. Please.

37:06.424 --> 37:09.688
I am prepared to hire you,
Miss Kellergan,

37:09.788 --> 37:13.251
and to let Harry Quebert
stay at Goose Cove

37:13.351 --> 37:14.252
for as long as he wishes.

37:14.352 --> 37:16.414
Really? Thank you--

37:16.514 --> 37:18.576
You haven't heard
what you'll be doing yet.

37:18.676 --> 37:20.858
Anything you want, sir.

37:20.958 --> 37:23.982
I would like
to hire you as a model.

37:24.082 --> 37:27.705
My chauffeur happens to be
a very fine painter.

37:27.805 --> 37:30.027
If you agree
to pose nude for him,

37:30.127 --> 37:33.531
Mr. Quebert can
stay in the house.

37:37.895 --> 37:39.677
I knew it was wrong,

37:39.777 --> 37:42.279
but I established
strict rules

37:42.379 --> 37:44.401
for her protection.

37:44.501 --> 37:47.444
I set them up in a small room
right next to my office,

37:47.544 --> 37:48.846
and I remained nearby

37:48.946 --> 37:50.367
to make sure that
he didn't try anything.

37:50.467 --> 37:52.329
I even put an intercom in there,

37:52.429 --> 37:53.370
so that I could make sure--

37:53.470 --> 37:55.472
Eli...

37:56.473 --> 37:57.694
I don't know what to say.

37:57.794 --> 37:59.656
He never touched her.

37:59.756 --> 38:01.758
I would never have allowed it.

38:04.441 --> 38:06.303
<i>[Marcus]: So Stern wasn't</i>
<i>the generous benefactor</i>

38:06.403 --> 38:08.985
<i>Harry thought he was.</i>

38:09.085 --> 38:10.947
But why would Stern let Luther
do something like that?

38:11.047 --> 38:12.749
I mean, unless...

38:12.849 --> 38:14.591
Was there something going on
between the two of them?

38:14.691 --> 38:15.912
I mean, he assured me

38:16.012 --> 38:17.474
that he just
felt sorry for the guy.

38:17.574 --> 38:19.836
Uh-huh.

38:19.936 --> 38:22.519
I hired him out of pity,

38:22.619 --> 38:25.642
and had grown fond of him.

38:25.742 --> 38:27.403
I had hoped

38:27.503 --> 38:29.525
that Nola
would be the last,

38:29.625 --> 38:30.767
that he would paint her,

38:30.867 --> 38:34.330
and get whatever it was
out of his system, but...

38:34.430 --> 38:37.413
that's not what happened.

38:37.513 --> 38:41.417
He would just... sit there,

38:41.517 --> 38:43.599
staring at the poor girl.

38:46.642 --> 38:50.506
Miss Kellergan,
are you all right?

38:50.606 --> 38:52.908
<i>[Stern]: One night as she left,</i>

38:53.008 --> 38:55.871
<i>I took her hand,</i>
<i>and it was cold as ice...</i>

38:55.971 --> 38:57.593
[Nola's footsteps

38:57.693 --> 39:00.596
<i>...and I just couldn't</i>
<i>do it anymore.</i>

39:00.696 --> 39:04.159
<i>But ending it</i>
<i>wasn't that simple.</i>

39:04.259 --> 39:09.644
<i>She had...</i>
<i>awakened something in Luther,</i>

39:09.744 --> 39:12.888
<i>and he'd fallen in love</i>
<i>with his model.</i>

39:12.988 --> 39:14.990
[car engine starts]

39:18.073 --> 39:21.576
<i>He'd become</i>
<i>consumed by jealousy...</i>

39:21.676 --> 39:23.778
[typewriter clacking]

39:23.878 --> 39:25.900
<i>...obsessed by Quebert,</i>

39:26.000 --> 39:28.503
<i>whom he considered</i>
<i>a competitor...</i>

39:28.603 --> 39:30.705
I'll be right back.

39:30.805 --> 39:32.226
Okay.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.789
<i>He started spying on him</i>
<i>at every possible moment.</i>

39:34.889 --> 39:37.792
<i>One day, I followed him</i>
<i>to Goose Cove</i>

39:37.892 --> 39:42.036
<i>and saw him there, hiding.</i>

39:42.136 --> 39:43.798
<i>I wanted to scare him off,</i>

39:43.898 --> 39:46.600
<i>make him think</i>
<i>he just dodged a bullet,</i>

39:46.700 --> 39:51.806
<i>so I acted as if I'd just</i>
<i>popped in to see Quebert...</i>

39:51.906 --> 39:54.208
You're working
too hard, Quebert!

39:54.308 --> 39:55.209
[Harry]:
Elijah Stern!

39:55.309 --> 39:58.452
What a surprise
to see you here!

39:58.552 --> 40:00.214
Come on up
on the deck.

40:00.314 --> 40:03.457
<i>[Stern]:</i>
<i>I told Luther it was done...</i>

40:03.557 --> 40:05.499
that the painting sessions
were over,

40:05.599 --> 40:08.222
and I forbade him to go
to Sommerdale ever again.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.384
And how did he take it?

40:10.484 --> 40:12.346
Not well.

40:12.446 --> 40:15.709
He continued to go,
despite my warnings.

40:15.809 --> 40:20.393
A few weeks later,
we had a terrible argument.

40:20.493 --> 40:23.436
He swore at me

40:23.536 --> 40:26.079
before storming off
and slamming the door.

40:26.179 --> 40:29.682
That was Friday, August 29th.

40:29.782 --> 40:31.244
When he didn't show up
the next day,

40:31.344 --> 40:32.285
I went into Sommerdale,

40:32.385 --> 40:35.408
only to find
police cars everywhere.

40:35.508 --> 40:38.731
Nola had disappeared.

40:38.831 --> 40:41.434
So you think it was Luther
who killed Nola?

40:43.035 --> 40:46.158
I've thought so
for the last 33 years.

40:48.681 --> 40:49.702
Right.

40:49.802 --> 40:51.223
And you never saw Luther again?

40:51.323 --> 40:53.506
No.

40:53.606 --> 40:55.187
The next day,
his father called,

40:55.287 --> 40:56.869
said he'd been
searching for him.

40:56.969 --> 40:58.551
I couldn't
bring myself

40:58.651 --> 41:01.554
to tell him
what had happened.

41:01.654 --> 41:03.916
I said he was on vacation.

41:04.016 --> 41:07.039
A month later,
the police called

41:07.139 --> 41:10.002
telling me
that he'd missed a turn,

41:10.102 --> 41:13.305
driven off a cliff.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.488
What is this?

41:16.588 --> 41:19.931
That is Luther Caleb's
accident report.

41:20.031 --> 41:22.274
Had an intern
dig it up for me.

41:23.715 --> 41:24.896
Yeah.

41:24.996 --> 41:27.038
The make and model
of the vehicle was left blank.

41:30.522 --> 41:32.524
<i>-So, remind me who this guy is?</i>
<i>-</i> Good job.

41:33.965 --> 41:35.106
<i>[Perry]: Wanslow.</i>

41:35.206 --> 41:37.589
<i>He was a police officer</i>
<i>in Sagamore,</i>

41:37.689 --> 41:40.852
<i>the one called to the scene</i>
<i>when they found Luther's car.</i>

41:42.093 --> 41:44.095
Hey.

41:45.416 --> 41:46.718
Officer Wanslow?

41:46.818 --> 41:48.199
Yes, sir.
How's it going?

41:48.299 --> 41:49.801
Good, man.

41:49.901 --> 41:52.283
Thanks for agreeing
to see us, Officer.

41:52.383 --> 41:54.385
I know it's going back
a few years.

41:55.226 --> 41:56.067
<i>[Wanslow]: This is</i>
<i>one of the things</i>

41:56.147 --> 41:58.189
<i>you don't forget, trust me.</i>

42:01.712 --> 42:03.013
I've been telling them
for years

42:03.113 --> 42:05.576
they should put
a guard rail up here.

42:05.676 --> 42:06.937
Must have been
cruising pretty good

42:07.037 --> 42:09.860
to blast through
the pullout.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.122
Ah, Jesus...

42:16.166 --> 42:18.168
[flies buzzing]

42:20.290 --> 42:21.792
Ooh!

42:21.892 --> 42:24.014
[buzzing intensifies]

42:25.735 --> 42:26.997
<i>[Wanslow]:</i>
<i>We found papers on him</i>

42:27.097 --> 42:29.099
<i>and determined</i>
<i>that he was Luther Caleb.</i>

42:30.820 --> 42:32.642
I ran his name.

42:32.742 --> 42:36.486
There was a harassment
complaint up in Sommerdale,

42:36.586 --> 42:39.169
and we'd all heard about
the Kellergan girl,

42:39.269 --> 42:40.610
so I called
their chief of police.

42:40.710 --> 42:43.112
He comes up right away.

42:44.794 --> 42:46.095
We traced
the license plate.

42:46.195 --> 42:48.258
Belongs to
an Augusta firm,

42:48.358 --> 42:50.700
Stern Continental
Transport.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.102
Thank you for doing
such a thorough job, Officer.

42:53.202 --> 42:54.143
Yeah, no problem.

42:54.243 --> 42:55.705
Yeah, I know that firm well.

42:55.805 --> 42:59.388
Belongs to the richest man
in Maine, Elijah Stern.

42:59.488 --> 43:02.151
Unfortunately,

43:02.251 --> 43:04.113
this isn't the vehicle I saw

43:04.213 --> 43:06.716
during the pursuit.

43:06.816 --> 43:08.998
What? But...

43:09.098 --> 43:10.679
it's a black Monte Carlo
just like--

43:10.779 --> 43:12.401
I know, I know, just...

43:12.501 --> 43:14.924
It wasn't this one.

43:15.024 --> 43:15.884
I don't know.

43:15.984 --> 43:17.366
I-I-I'm not really,
really sure now

43:17.466 --> 43:18.967
if it was a Monte Carlo.

43:19.067 --> 43:21.090
Maybe it was a Nova.

43:21.190 --> 43:23.952
Nova?

43:25.314 --> 43:26.495
Okay...

43:26.595 --> 43:30.699
You know, just file this
as a... a standard accident,

43:30.799 --> 43:32.421
maybe leave off
the make and model.

43:32.521 --> 43:35.343
Don't want to get everyone
all excited for no reason.

43:35.443 --> 43:39.307
We all want to find
that poor girl.

43:39.407 --> 43:41.429
Good work, Officer.

43:41.529 --> 43:43.972
Sure. Uh, my pleasure.

43:48.977 --> 43:50.038
So Pratt found
the black Monte Carlo,

43:50.138 --> 43:51.599
then he dismissed it?

43:51.699 --> 43:53.081
I hear his wife
kicked him out.

43:53.181 --> 43:54.362
I'll call the station
and find out where he is.

43:54.462 --> 43:56.464
No, actually, I already know.

44:09.316 --> 44:11.318
I think that's his truck.

44:22.409 --> 44:23.671
[knocking insistently]

44:23.771 --> 44:25.032
Pratt?
[rattling doorknob]

44:25.132 --> 44:27.274
The light's on.

44:27.374 --> 44:28.275
There's the lady.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.377
Excuse me.

44:30.857 --> 44:31.959
Can you open this for us?

44:32.059 --> 44:32.960
I can't.

44:33.060 --> 44:33.961
Yes, you can.

44:34.061 --> 44:35.242
No, I mean,
I tried earlier.

44:35.342 --> 44:37.344
It's bolted from the inside.

44:38.305 --> 44:39.686
[knocking urgently]

44:39.786 --> 44:41.788
Pratt, open up!

45:01.407 --> 45:03.409
[âªâªâªâªâª]
