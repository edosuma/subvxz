00:18.934 --> 00:20.799
It's alive!

00:39.188 --> 00:41.418
I- I don't... I don't know
what's going on.

00:41.490 --> 00:42.980
This never really happens to me.

00:43.058 --> 00:45.583
Not having a penis never
happens to you?

00:45.661 --> 00:48.391
Bartender, give me a Scotch,
a backup Scotch, and a boiler Scotch.

00:48.463 --> 00:51.159
That's a shot of Scotch floating
in a bigger glass of Scotch.

00:51.233 --> 00:52.928
Now, Scotch me,
Scotch face.

00:53.001 --> 00:54.559
Wow, are you Scottish?

00:54.636 --> 00:56.831
I am U.S. Senator
Ted Kennedy.

00:56.905 --> 01:00.466
I'm Jenna Jameson,
the world's most famous porn star.

01:00.542 --> 01:01.474
What's wrong?

01:01.543 --> 01:03.340
Celebrities in politics.

01:03.412 --> 01:05.812
Schwarzenegger, Ventura,
Franken.

01:05.881 --> 01:07.940
Soon, bloated, repulsive
politicians like me

01:08.016 --> 01:09.847
won't find
work anymore.

01:09.918 --> 01:13.479
Hey, celebrities take work
away from honest porn stars, too...

01:13.555 --> 01:16.285
Paris Hilton,
Pam Anderson, Screech.

01:16.358 --> 01:17.723
What the hell's a Screech?

01:17.793 --> 01:18.782
Aw, screw it, Jenna.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.350
If my family's taught me
anything,

01:20.429 --> 01:23.523
it's that there's only one good
way to get rid of somebody.

01:23.599 --> 01:25.362
Crash their plane into the
ocean?

01:25.434 --> 01:26.560
No, the other way.

01:26.635 --> 01:27.602
Drive off a bridge?

01:27.669 --> 01:30.001
No,
I'm talking about...

01:32.207 --> 01:33.469
Yah!

01:33.542 --> 01:36.340
Paris, get that cock out of
your mouth.

01:36.411 --> 01:37.878
That's my job.

01:42.751 --> 01:45.015
Remember when I said I'd kill
you last?

01:45.087 --> 01:46.952
No, I don't recall that...

01:47.022 --> 01:49.718
Oh, you are doing a line
from my movie.

01:49.791 --> 01:50.621
I lied.

01:50.692 --> 01:52.125
I know how it goes.

01:52.194 --> 01:54.025
Aah!

01:54.096 --> 01:55.324
You suck!

01:55.397 --> 01:56.694
Sayonara, Scotch.

01:56.765 --> 01:57.595
Screech.

01:57.666 --> 01:58.530
Whatever.

02:01.136 --> 02:03.127
Aah!

02:07.709 --> 02:09.267
Holy schnikes!

02:10.612 --> 02:11.579
Hello?

02:11.647 --> 02:13.114
Seth, honey, are you at the
Oscars?

02:13.181 --> 02:14.773
No, mom, I'm watching them at
home.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.112
Why aren't you at the Oscars?

02:16.184 --> 02:17.651
'Cause, mom, I wasn't
nominated.

02:17.719 --> 02:19.812
When are you going to start
doing prestige pictures?

02:19.888 --> 02:21.219
I do work I'm proud of.

02:21.290 --> 02:24.020
Apparently, a little fellow
named Oscar thinks differently.

02:24.092 --> 02:25.081
God damn it!

02:25.160 --> 02:28.926
This is the greatest day of
my life!

02:31.366 --> 02:33.231
Oh, baby.

02:39.308 --> 02:41.367
Micro Machines Man here to
tell you about the genuine,

02:41.443 --> 02:43.502
original, marvelously majestic
micro machines collection.

02:43.578 --> 02:45.910
Make these cars zoom and vroom,
veer and sneer, jump and bump.

02:45.981 --> 02:48.108
Micro Machines Man used to own a
1965 mustang convertible,

02:48.183 --> 02:49.844
but his wicked witchifing wife took it
and everything he owned

02:49.918 --> 02:51.715
in a divorce proceeding that
left yours truly emasculated,

02:51.787 --> 02:53.118
devoid of testicles,

02:53.188 --> 02:55.315
nothing but an empty scrotum
swinging between his legs,

02:55.390 --> 02:56.687
like a portentous pendulum
tick-tock ticking

02:56.758 --> 02:58.555
away the remains of
yesterday's youth and vigor.

02:58.627 --> 03:01.061
Yes, the sea cow from the black hole
married Micro Machines Man not

03:01.129 --> 03:02.528
for the promise of eternal
tongue tickling,

03:02.597 --> 03:04.462
but for an amorphous amore only
a succubus

03:04.533 --> 03:06.558
could inflict on a balding
butthead with poor prospects.

03:06.635 --> 03:07.966
I'll never see my kids again.

03:08.036 --> 03:10.027
Tonight's the night when a rigid
Remington rifle barrel

03:10.105 --> 03:11.834
gets frenetically fellated and
brain matter

03:11.907 --> 03:13.738
goes splatter and the big
blanket of darkness

03:13.809 --> 03:15.299
gives cold comfort to a broken
bastard.

03:15.377 --> 03:18.642
For a product you can't take with
you to the grave, by Galoob.

03:18.714 --> 03:20.011
Be careful, daddy.

03:26.888 --> 03:29.152
Aah!

03:46.708 --> 03:48.539
Draw.

03:52.981 --> 03:55.472
Ow!

03:58.754 --> 04:00.085
No!

04:00.155 --> 04:01.281
I did it, princess!

04:01.356 --> 04:03.483
I've been through hell and back
to save you.

04:03.558 --> 04:04.650
Oh, thank goodness.

04:04.726 --> 04:05.886
Ganon was such a beast.

04:05.961 --> 04:07.326
I was a little bit badass.

04:07.396 --> 04:09.864
Yeah, I killed thousands of
Octoroks and retrieved

04:09.931 --> 04:11.922
the Triforce of wisdom,
just for you.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.436
I truly appreciate it.

04:15.504 --> 04:16.664
Truly.

04:16.738 --> 04:19.366
Yeah, yeah, a good fantasy
adventure it was,

04:19.440 --> 04:21.534
with a wonderful fairy-tale
ending.

04:21.610 --> 04:23.237
Eh-heh.

04:23.311 --> 04:25.506
Look, kid, I know where you're
going with this,

04:25.580 --> 04:28.208
and you have to realize that I
barely know you.

04:28.283 --> 04:29.614
But I'm the one who...

04:29.684 --> 04:31.618
I've been rescued before.

04:31.686 --> 04:33.745
It's part of being a princess.

04:33.822 --> 04:34.982
Yeah, but...

04:35.056 --> 04:37.251
Of course, the first time I
was ever rescued,

04:37.325 --> 04:40.192
I fucked that guy's brains out.

04:40.262 --> 04:41.194
Hoo!

04:41.263 --> 04:43.788
Ha!

04:43.865 --> 04:46.299
But you're like the
eighth-something.

04:46.368 --> 04:47.426
I've lost track.

04:47.502 --> 04:49.060
But it's my first time.

04:49.137 --> 04:50.900
I mean, in more ways than one.

04:50.972 --> 04:54.203
Look, some cherries you get
to pop, some you don't.

04:54.276 --> 04:57.211
How long did this rescue take
you, 20, 30 hours?

04:57.279 --> 04:58.678
It took me 50 hours.

04:58.747 --> 05:00.544
50?
Wow, you suck.

05:00.615 --> 05:03.550
Oh, look, I only have eight
rupees.

05:03.618 --> 05:05.381
Take it for your time.

05:05.454 --> 05:06.443
Take it, thanks.

05:06.521 --> 05:07.647
A grateful kingdom.

05:07.722 --> 05:09.212
I'm out.

05:11.326 --> 05:14.352
Then I will save you,
my princess.

05:14.429 --> 05:17.796
And now watch me escape from
this straitjacket.

05:22.237 --> 05:23.067
Success!

05:23.138 --> 05:24.765
I told you I'd do it!

05:25.941 --> 05:27.238
Why are you clapping?

05:27.309 --> 05:29.709
A violent schizophrenic rapist
with touches of dementia

05:29.778 --> 05:32.269
and the strength of eight men
just escaped.

05:32.347 --> 05:33.939
Yeah, he escaped from his
straitjacket.

05:34.015 --> 05:35.004
Really?

05:35.083 --> 05:36.550
I would have loved to have
seen that.

05:36.618 --> 05:37.607
Aah!

05:38.420 --> 05:40.047
Now smile.

05:40.121 --> 05:41.713
Perfect, yes.

05:55.737 --> 05:56.726
That stopped him.

05:56.805 --> 05:58.534
Yeah, but, man,
a spike strip?

05:58.607 --> 06:00.939
I mean, couldn't we have tried a
warning first?

06:01.009 --> 06:02.943
Yeah, we could have,
but we didn't.

06:05.046 --> 06:07.776
Actually, I prefer
African-American lagoon,

06:07.849 --> 06:09.373
thank you very much.

06:09.451 --> 06:11.214
Once again, good trumps evil,

06:11.286 --> 06:13.880
and General Spidrax's plan has
been thwarted.

06:13.955 --> 06:15.650
But I'm sure Spidrax will be

06:15.724 --> 06:18.659
spinning a new web of deceit
before long, Dargon.

06:19.728 --> 06:21.218
Spidrax, spinning web.

06:21.296 --> 06:25.130
I see what you did there, Zak,
and I like it.

06:26.635 --> 06:29.695
Dragonflyer, you ignorant bitch,
heed my telepathic commands.

06:29.771 --> 06:30.897
You use telepathy?

06:30.972 --> 06:32.963
I always just kick mine
in the ribs.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.737
Wait, we're being pulled into
a tractor beam.

06:35.810 --> 06:38.108
It must be Spidrax weaving a
new web.

06:38.179 --> 06:40.306
The time for spider puns is
past.

06:40.382 --> 06:41.371
Prepare to fight.

06:41.449 --> 06:44.148
Aah!

06:44.219 --> 06:45.345
Oh, goodness.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.978
That was a big one.

06:49.524 --> 06:52.516
Make sure your bindles are
stowed properly.

06:52.594 --> 06:57.725
Please direct your attention to
the exits here and here.

06:57.799 --> 07:00.734
The meal today will be a
warmed-up can of beans,

07:00.802 --> 07:04.499
and the in-flight movie will be
crazy John acting out scenes

07:04.573 --> 07:05.835
from "Forrest Gump."

07:05.907 --> 07:08.341
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan!

07:08.410 --> 07:10.344
Enjoy your flight,

07:10.412 --> 07:13.108
and thank you for flying
homeless airlines.

07:14.382 --> 07:15.644
Aah!

07:15.717 --> 07:17.412
And that's how I'm gonna get
home to Alaska.

07:17.485 --> 07:19.919
I'm the President
of jelly beans!

07:19.988 --> 07:21.455
Turn your head and cough.

07:21.523 --> 07:23.787
Ah, just as I suspected.

07:23.858 --> 07:26.725
You let a stranger grab
your balls.

07:28.363 --> 07:31.526
All right, I'm gonna
disconnect your air machine.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.363
Then you're gonna go to sleep.

07:33.435 --> 07:37.496
And then'll give you a shot,
and you'll stay asleep.

07:44.512 --> 07:49.347
"Mo chuisle" means
"my darling," "my blood."

08:04.699 --> 08:06.826
For picture quality that puts
cable to rest,

08:06.901 --> 08:08.493
you've got to
pick Direct TV.

08:33.662 --> 08:36.323
Boss, this is taking forever.

08:36.398 --> 08:38.332
Keep chopping,
you drain clog.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.892
Once we harvest the energy of
the oldest tree in Eternia,

08:41.970 --> 08:45.371
we can destroy Castle Grayskull
once and for all!

08:45.440 --> 08:49.137
You know, Skeletor,
based on our track record,

08:49.210 --> 08:50.507
this probably won't work.

08:50.578 --> 08:53.547
Uh, life's a journey,
not a destination.

08:53.615 --> 08:55.139
Not so fast, Skeletor.

08:55.216 --> 08:58.083
Trees are some of our most
precious resources.

08:58.153 --> 09:00.087
Uh...

09:00.155 --> 09:01.713
Who are you talking to?

09:01.823 --> 09:02.812
Your face.

09:02.891 --> 09:03.721
Ow!

09:03.792 --> 09:05.089
You know what they say...

09:05.160 --> 09:07.720
a bird in the hand is worth two
in the bush.

09:07.796 --> 09:08.626
Stop it.

09:08.697 --> 09:10.221
What, you gonna cry now?

09:10.298 --> 09:12.027
You gonna cry like a big baby?

09:12.100 --> 09:14.466
I don't even have tear ducts,
you jerk.

09:14.536 --> 09:15.935
You know what you need?

09:16.004 --> 09:18.336
A good skull fucking.

09:18.406 --> 09:19.395
What?

09:19.474 --> 09:20.338
Uh!

09:20.408 --> 09:21.670
What the...

09:21.743 --> 09:24.075
Oh, crap!
Oh, crap!

09:24.145 --> 09:25.737
Beast Man, what did you do?

09:25.814 --> 09:26.872
I don't know.

09:26.948 --> 09:29.712
I mean, I thought he would block
it or something.

09:29.784 --> 09:30.978
I mean, he's He-man.

09:31.052 --> 09:33.646
This is the first murder in
Eternian history.

09:33.722 --> 09:36.589
If the king finds out, it's the
guillotine for us all.

09:36.658 --> 09:38.023
Oh, god.
Oh, god.

09:38.093 --> 09:40.789
Oh, we're up shit's creek
without a paddle, man.

09:40.862 --> 09:42.056
# He-man #

09:42.130 --> 09:43.722
Okay, read that back to me.

09:43.798 --> 09:46.232
"Being He-man sucked more
than you think.

09:46.301 --> 09:48.326
Falling backwards onto
an ax now,

09:48.403 --> 09:50.894
the way I always talked
about doing.

09:50.972 --> 09:52.462
Love,
He-man."

09:52.540 --> 09:53.734
Foolproof!

09:53.808 --> 09:56.368
Let's get the hell out of
here.

09:56.444 --> 09:57.843
Oh, no.

09:57.912 --> 10:02.781
I must tell King Randor and the
Sorceress this terrible news.

10:02.851 --> 10:04.546
# He-man #

10:07.889 --> 10:09.447
Oh, we're so dead.

10:09.524 --> 10:11.890
Oh, we're so dead, we're so
dead, we're so dead,

10:11.960 --> 10:12.824
we're so screwed.

10:12.894 --> 10:14.418
I'm turning over a new leaf.

10:14.496 --> 10:17.863
From this point forward,
I'm no longer Evil-lyn.

10:17.932 --> 10:20.196
You may call
me Good-lyn.

10:20.268 --> 10:21.326
Heh.

10:21.402 --> 10:23.131
You know, I always thought your
name was Evelyn.

10:23.204 --> 10:24.228
It's weird.

10:24.305 --> 10:26.068
All this time,
it's been Evil-lyn?

10:26.141 --> 10:27.438
Pretty clever, right?

10:27.509 --> 10:28.339
No.

10:29.644 --> 10:32.807
Oh, game over,
man, game over.

10:32.881 --> 10:34.576
Why is that door locked?

10:34.649 --> 10:36.981
I've got to take a dump.

10:37.051 --> 10:39.281
Holy fucking shit.

10:39.354 --> 10:41.481
All:
Aah!

10:41.556 --> 10:44.582
I have the power!

10:45.527 --> 10:48.257
I have crapped my pants!

10:48.329 --> 10:49.796
# He-man #

10:49.864 --> 10:54.358
Orko, oh, thank goodness you
found He-man's sword of power.

10:54.435 --> 10:56.665
We can use it to bring him back
to life.

10:56.738 --> 11:00.174
He-man would be back and I'd
be regular Orko again?

11:00.241 --> 11:01.469
Absolutely.

11:01.543 --> 11:04.842
Yeah, but then that happened.

11:08.950 --> 11:11.282
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

11:11.352 --> 11:13.411
