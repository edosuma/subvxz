Maybe you need this.
my mother has nothing against it.

03:36.830 --> 03:42.660
I am not feeling well any longer in this town.
In Marseille we were so happy.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.330
I asked for a shifting.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.250
-And what about me?
-Oh, you..., err,

-But Philo, I...
-The street is my future.

03:59.580 --> 04:05.250

But you know, I can't marry you,i explained it to you.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.700

-Little french shit-officer, come on.
-What?  In German, if i am allowed to ask.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.700
Why is Villette not going to marry you?

07:48.080 --> 07:54.410
His wife got lost, He never saw her again.
Well, war...

07:57.040 --> 08:00.040
is guilty on everything.

08:02.700 --> 08:09.040
If there can't be adduced a proof of his wifes death,a divorce is impossible.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.290
The man isn't foolish!
Do you love him?

08:13.580 --> 08:17.870
Georges, i have to marry,to become a French.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.290
Marriage is a good idea.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.200
-Everything will be fine..
-Yes?

08:26.620 --> 08:30.540
I found your wife, Madame Villette.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.540
Anxious?

08:32.830 --> 08:34.830
-Does that scare you?
-No.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.290
As expected, Madam Villette native
Leoni Galone is dead.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.580
She doesn't exist any more.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.250

as i were a soldier!

10:32.580 --> 10:34.200
Would be a joke, wouldn't it?!

10:39.700 --> 10:44.160
Aha, a visitor!

-He was sympathetic.
-Very.

21:31.290 --> 21:36.620
We should have ensured him.

in his condition.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.290
He is a ruin.

22:32.750 --> 22:37.450
You go through the customary examinations
and undersign the contract!

33:13.700 --> 33:16.330
you miserable pimp, you pimp...

33:29.290 --> 33:31.830
<i>Father!  You there!</i>

33:46.000 --> 33:50.580
-She's obscene.
-Yes, is not it?  -However.

33:51.700 --> 33:55.250
-And he's not exactly ugly.
-If you think...

33:56.080 --> 33:58.450
Do you know how
big her fortune is?

33:59.500 --> 34:01.250
Accurate to francs and centimes.

34:01.450 --> 34:04.540
I even know how
they acquired it.

34:07.500 --> 34:12.200
I like you, you always act
so confident in what you say.

34:13.330 --> 34:17.580
With guys like you, killers
have a chance to save their heads.

34:19.830 --> 34:22.120
-It was worth the sight, wasn't it?
-Oh jLa!

34:35.580 --> 34:37.580
money disgusts me.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.620
It kills love.

34:41.410 --> 34:45.790
I did not bring you to this opinion.
My dear.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.370
So, 50:50!

35:06.700 --> 35:10.660
Don't tickle me!
No, stop it now.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.540
Get down. Put your head down.
It is not working this way.

35:27.790 --> 35:30.040
Sit up.

35:41.660 --> 35:43.160
Damned.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.450
We need two bathtubs.

36:10.910 --> 36:14.160
Philomena, Catherine, help me.

36:23.660 --> 36:25.790
Catherine?!

36:38.200 --> 36:40.750
<i>Do  something!</i>

36:49.830 --> 36:52.000
<i>So, let's leave it there for now.</i>

36:53.120 --> 36:54.870
<i>Thanks.</i>

36:55.290 --> 36:57.200
<i>Come on.</i>

37:07.870 --> 37:10.250
<i>-Not everything!
—Come on, lend a hand!</i>

37:10.450 --> 37:12.500
<i>Come on'</i>

37:36.950 --> 37:39.200
How do you spell "Merry
Christmas" in French?

37:40.040 --> 37:45.160
J-o-y-e-u-x Noal.

37:45.410 --> 37:51.790
N-o-ä-I.
With two dots on the e.

38:11.870 --> 38:14.250
Don't, Noemie.

38:14.500 --> 38:18.450
Let's do it now,
we'll have tomorrow off.

38:19.080 --> 38:23.080
Stop the jingling, you don't understand
your own words anymore.  I'll help.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.830
Leave her, that's the
way it is at this age.

38:26.540 --> 38:28.290
And it's not a
festival every day.

40:26.750 --> 40:30.540
I enjoy life, I
take it by the horns!

40:30.750 --> 40:36.120
The Father always sees only the
bad, he has no talent for happiness.

40:36.330 --> 40:40.790
Hello Georges!  Father always
says happiness is for fools.

42:49.870 --> 42:52.080
Sarret!

43:00.410 --> 43:02.950
Let go.  Go away.

43:29.410 --> 43:31.580
Leave... leave it!

44:54.290 --> 44:56.200
And off!

45:02.500 --> 45:04.540
take the legs  The legs!

45:11.540 --> 45:13.450
Damn it!

45:26.290 --> 45:32.000
DANGEROUS FEL ACID

52:53.000 --> 52:55.330
Santa Clause arrives in the evening.

55:47.450 --> 55:48.540
My God.

56:36.040 --> 56:38.700
Tomorrow at 2pm at my
notary, Miaitre Perrin.

56:42.410 --> 56:44.450
Practice all night if necessary.

56:48.950 --> 56:51.910
Tomorrow at 11 o'clock you
will be Chambon...

56:52.540 --> 56:55.250
You will be Chambon.

56:56.120 --> 57:02.120
A Monsieur Chambon is going to sign a
letter of attorney to lawyer Sarret.

57:08.290 --> 57:10.250
Present here.

57:15.910 --> 57:18.870
Try to appreciate my trust.

57:21.500 --> 57:23.450
The lovely Chambon.

57:29.040 --> 57:31.250
The hairline is on the right.

57:55.040 --> 57:58.870
-Well. Allright, Monsieur Chambon.
-Chambon!

57:59.830 --> 58:04.580
Goodbye, Monsieur Chambon,have a nice trip.
You can sleep assuaged, we know lawyer Sarret very well.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.160
Beautiful!

58:17.200 --> 58:19.370
Beautiful!

58:25.540 --> 58:29.370
Isn't it a little bit eccentric?

58:32.540 --> 58:34.910
I am crazy. I buy...i buy it.

58:36.250 --> 58:39.830
I do a deposit now.
How much Monsieur Chambon?

58:40.160 --> 58:43.200
I am not Chambon, Madame.
I am his person in charge.

58:43.870 --> 58:47.250
I don't negotiate with somebody.
I would like to speak to the owner.

58:47.830 --> 58:51.910
-He is in the Switzerland.
-What is he doing in a foreign country?

58:54.500 --> 58:57.580
A unlucky lovestory.

59:00.040 --> 59:06.160
An controverted ardor.
A jealous husband.Flee. Escape.

59:06.500 --> 59:11.250
Italien lakes, clouds, jeopardies.
The love, Madame.

59:11.870 --> 59:17.040
-I want to meet him.  Bring him here!
-Difficult.

59:17.870 --> 59:20.910
Incognito.Without cash.

59:22.790 --> 59:24.620
Maybe we can...

59:25.000 --> 59:28.160
help him with a train ticket.
Including return journey, of course.

59:33.580 --> 59:37.910
Toward...
and back!

59:39.830 --> 59:43.290
- Monsieur Chambon has arrived.
-Welcome, Monsieur Chambon.

59:47.040 --> 59:50.200
-How was it in the Switzerland?
-Clean, very clean.

59:50.790 --> 59:53.250
Adored Madame,

59:53.660 --> 59:56.040
Monsieur Chambon,

59:57.540 --> 59:59.540
A little signature, please.

1:05:32.830 --> 1:05:35.000
Catherine?!

1:05:39.290 --> 1:05:42.120
- Catherine!  !!
-I am coming!

1:05:42.370 --> 1:05:44.540
Don't speak with a mouth full.

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:50.910
Damned shit!

1:06:51.450 --> 1:06:53.660
Up here. I place you in the water.

1:07:04.370 --> 1:07:07.080
Yes, something, but i don't know what.
But what? That is, what it is about.

1:07:07.250 --> 1:07:12.000
What is it?  That's
why I called you.

1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:24.040
In Marseille are such kinds of smell...

1:07:24.290 --> 1:07:27.580
Well, Marseille. That is right.
But we are in Akes.

1:07:27.830 --> 1:07:29.410
I am sorry, but i don't smell anything.

1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:33.160
A little bit it is smelling like...
like a pigpen.

1:07:33.370 --> 1:07:37.500
Damned. I don't have a pigpen.
This is an insult.

1:07:37.660 --> 1:07:41.540
You can't decide to the smell.

1:07:41.870 --> 1:07:45.500
The man who leased this house is known
as very honorable.

1:07:45.830 --> 1:07:48.790
Maitre Sarret bestows a lot of money to the diocese

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.040
and you want to assume him something?
No, no.

1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:55.290
What do you want to do?
A trial?

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:57.330
Besides, i insure you,
i smell nothing.

1:07:57.500 --> 1:08:00.200
You can speak easy.
You don't have to live here.

1:08:00.410 --> 1:08:04.540
Well Monsieur, don't be afraid.
To sell now is not the right moment.

1:08:04.700 --> 1:08:06.540
No no...

1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:25.660
To sell now is not the right moment.

1:08:26.040 --> 1:08:30.870
-Falling Tendencies at the stock market.
- For you there never is the right moment.

1:08:32.250 --> 1:08:35.500
Georges, do you think we are beginners?

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.080
I will bring you the dessert.

1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:53.000
Jewelry! Jewelry?

1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:05.910
And the?

1:09:11.540 --> 1:09:13.870
...is difficult.

1:09:17.950 --> 1:09:19.500
Come on, that's not real.

1:09:36.290 --> 1:09:39.500
COBBLER DI LORENZO

1:09:41.830 --> 1:09:43.870
My ladies!

1:09:49.410 --> 1:09:55.000
There is the future. There.
If somebody would help me...

1:09:55.700 --> 1:09:58.660
a man who has to live a year.
If it is much.

1:09:59.290 --> 1:10:02.750
One year?
Your shoemaker? I donate him to you.

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:07.790
COBBLER

1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:12.160
Good evening, monsieur.
Can you fix my heel?

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:54.000
-Are you feeling better, today?
-If i always would have been cherished

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:59.410
like now. I would be in
good condition again!

1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:06.080
-I have your documents with me.
-Yes, this is very kindful.

1:11:06.290 --> 1:11:09.160
-Here please.
-Ah yes, thank you very much.

1:11:09.500 --> 1:11:11.620
And a rosary.

1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:15.950
-It will help you.
- It ins't that urgent.

1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:17.290
Yes, sure!

1:11:17.290 --> 1:11:19.500
-Name?
-Delorenzo.

1:11:19.700 --> 1:11:22.080
-First name?
- Alberto.

1:11:22.330 --> 1:11:24.910
-Profession?
-Shoemaker..

1:11:24.910 --> 1:11:30.540
-Legal heir in case of death?
- Maitre Georges Sarret.

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.410
Did you have any heart-, lung-,
stomach-, kidneysickness?

1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:39.540
Of sensory organs!
No no no.

1:11:40.250 --> 1:11:45.330
Do you explain to conceal
nothing about your actual fitness,

1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:48.120
as well as your fitness in the past?
Yes!

1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:03.290
Depending to smoking!

1:12:37.870 --> 1:12:39.750
The world is a sorrowful place,

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:44.620
but due to the Fratanelle
the sun will shine at the end.

1:12:45.250 --> 1:12:47.120
Always at your service, monsieur.

1:12:47.290 --> 1:12:49.750
Don't hesitate to engage us.

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.830
Faster! Faster! Faster!

1:13:24.910 --> 1:13:27.870
Have you thought about your future?

1:13:28.950 --> 1:13:30.450
No!
About your children?

1:13:30.620 --> 1:13:32.080
No!
About your parents?

1:13:32.370 --> 1:13:34.950
A life insurance will let you be free
from such problems!

1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:36.870
This is an sharp idea!

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:41.330
Imagine, Catherine would
subscribe 5 insurances.

1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:46.410
-Why not ten?
- That's too much, 5 are enough.
5 contracts in 5 different cities!

1:13:46.580 --> 1:13:48.580
Why me and not Philomene?

1:13:48.830 --> 1:13:51.750
-The younger the insurant, the fewer the bonus.
-Thanks.

1:13:52.870 --> 1:13:56.120
No. 5 contracts signed by Catherine Schmidt,

1:13:56.370 --> 1:13:57.750
in favor of Philomena Schmidt.

1:13:57.910 --> 1:14:00.620
-But i don't want to die. Are you crazy?!
-No, in due course...

1:14:00.870 --> 1:14:07.660
In the right moment Philomena

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:10.750
hopeless sick girl. Ready to die.

1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:15.620
and who we pass off
as Catherine Schmidt.

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:20.160
-And, ladies?
-Hats off!

1:14:20.410 --> 1:14:21.950
Hats off.

1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:30.120
My husband died
and left a remarkable fortune behind,

1:14:30.870 --> 1:14:34.620
but no child.No heirs!

1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:39.540
So i decided,
to use my fortune to beneficence.

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:45.620
I try to find a poor girl.

1:14:48.950 --> 1:14:51.950
For example an young orphan!

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:59.200
God prescribes us our tasks,
doesn't he, Doktor?

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.790
Fine! Beautiful!

1:15:35.330 --> 1:15:37.450
It is expensive!

1:15:40.950 --> 1:15:45.080
Tavern, Tavern, Tavern...

1:15:45.410 --> 1:15:47.660
The movement does not depend on me.

1:15:47.870 --> 1:15:50.790
This scandal does not affect them.

1:15:51.370 --> 1:15:57.410
I withdraw my candidacy for the
May elections without bitterness,

1:15:57.910 --> 1:16:02.000
so I can fight better,
you'll thank me for it.

1:16:02.620 --> 1:16:08.910
-But for this you nominate...
-We vote!

1:16:09.250 --> 1:16:13.000
...in my place my
friend Georges Sarret.

1:16:13.250 --> 1:16:17.620
Who is best placed to bear
this heavy responsibility.

1:16:21.910 --> 1:16:27.290
-But not here!
- Support Committee Sarret, yes please?

1:16:27.950 --> 1:16:29.950
-Breast out a little.
-I understand.

1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:33.700
Maitre, Maitre, a phonecall!
I beg your pardon.

1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:36.120
Maitre, i am afraid, it is a little
bit too much for us.

1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:37.580
-Hi?
- Just wait and see.

1:16:37.790 --> 1:16:42.250
Yes, Mr President!
This is Doctor Guy speaking.  Yes!

1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:45.160
Our business is moving
forward, Mr. President.

1:16:45.950 --> 1:16:48.200
Marseilles will be informed.

1:16:48.410 --> 1:16:51.040
- Am I good here?
-Yes this is good.

1:16:51.250 --> 1:16:52.750
-Danger!
-I will tell him, Mr. President.

1:16:52.950 --> 1:16:55.160
Don't move, please.

1:16:57.450 --> 1:16:59.660
These bonuses each quarter...

1:17:00.620 --> 1:17:03.370
plus the pensions

1:17:03.830 --> 1:17:06.290
the cost of choice

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:11.660
-Do you have a problem with the due date?
-Due date?  I beg you.

1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:16.910
Beginning, middle
and end of a month.

1:17:17.250 --> 1:17:20.580
Did you at least find
Catherine's future body?

1:17:21.450 --> 1:17:23.750
I'm fed up with
paying the premiums.

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:27.500
Find the rare little
bird if you're so great!

1:17:28.250 --> 1:17:31.160
-Do I seem like a charitable lady?
-No.

1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:33.870
What do you want to hear?

1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:38.250
Catherine got the insurance,
you profit but can't find it

1:17:38.450 --> 1:17:42.750
who lies in the coffin instead of her?
I've never had such problems.

1:17:45.250 --> 1:17:47.950
I'll pay somehow, like always.

1:17:48.830 --> 1:17:52.000
Or I'll kill my sister
to get the money.

1:17:52.330 --> 1:17:54.620
You are a monster.

1:17:55.620 --> 1:17:58.450
I notified you immediately.

1:18:00.330 --> 1:18:05.660
It came eight days ago
and I'm sure I'm not wrong.

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:11.450
She is really very ill, rickety,

1:18:11.700 --> 1:18:16.660
malnourished, neglected,
lungs like rags...

1:18:17.370 --> 1:18:21.750
A very ragged heart,just a poor misery!

1:18:23.660 --> 1:18:26.200
She would be too much work for us.

1:18:26.660 --> 1:18:29.830
Not enough manpower, understand?

1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:36.790
-Is she single?
-Of course, no family.

1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:40.080
Guaranteed an orphan.

1:18:41.540 --> 1:18:43.250
They are very friendly!

1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:47.750
Lord, forgive me,
but this is a miracle.

1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:19.330
Made!  I think
Philomene found one.

1:19:20.450 --> 1:19:22.790
-Is that safe?
-I hope so.

1:19:23.330 --> 1:19:25.830
I want this to stop.

1:19:26.870 --> 1:19:31.370
-Not bad, right?
-You are very beautiful.

1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:35.950
It inspires... confidence.

1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:38.750
People don't vote who knows who.

1:19:40.830 --> 1:19:43.290
I shouldn't have come back.

1:19:47.700 --> 1:19:52.950
Tell me your name

1:19:56.330 --> 1:19:58.040
Take!

1:20:04.250 --> 1:20:06.700
Look!

1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:13.580
And here.
It is nice, isn't it?

1:20:18.790 --> 1:20:22.330
Gabrielle?  Maria Teresia?

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:27.750
Josiane?  Martin?
Am I getting on your nerves?

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:31.620
Ok, i go now!

1:20:32.580 --> 1:20:35.540
And i will never come back.

1:20:41.250 --> 1:20:45.700
Please stay.
My name is Magali Herbin.

1:20:48.870 --> 1:20:50.910
Finally.

1:20:51.330 --> 1:20:55.660
i just want to help you,
do you understand?

1:21:28.410 --> 1:21:32.370
Try to thank the good Lord!

1:21:38.370 --> 1:21:39.830
Hermione!

1:21:42.410 --> 1:21:45.370
Get your clothes on.
You are shameless.

1:21:51.580 --> 1:21:53.830
Catherine, Hermione.

1:21:55.450 --> 1:22:00.040
i am melancholic.
You remind me on your sister, Catherine.

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:11.870
There is the new Catherine Schmidt.
Widowed Detreuil.

1:22:20.790 --> 1:22:24.000
Hermione, this is Magali.

1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:26.290
Hermine will look after you.

1:22:26.580 --> 1:22:29.200
Exclusively after you.

1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:33.660
Compliment.

1:23:27.540 --> 1:23:31.450
I am going to get camphor, stay here, Catahrine.
Stay with her, Hermine.

1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:37.290
Thanks!

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:44.250
Do you remember something?

1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:48.290
He was a brave man.

1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:53.160
We will go out a lot with her.

1:24:53.660 --> 1:24:57.290
Much drinking, much smoking, few sleeping.

1:24:57.870 --> 1:25:00.450
-Destroy her!
-Can i go out with you?

1:25:00.620 --> 1:25:02.250
Lungsick people are strange.

1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:08.660
You are at the same time very sad
and full of life, above all sensual.

1:25:11.580 --> 1:25:14.200
His midday devil
rides the Maitre Sarret.

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:16.080
What kind of tantrum?

1:25:16.450 --> 1:25:18.000
Catherine, my dear,

1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:22.500
your sister has fulfilled her mission impressively.

1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:27.620
Now it is your turn.

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:30.500
Spend your nights with her
and we will win several months.

1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:34.120
-But i find nothing interesting in women...
-Doesn't matter!

1:25:38.450 --> 1:25:40.580
What does Philomena think?

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:42.870
If Catherine agrees,

1:25:43.370 --> 1:25:45.830
i will replace her in housekeeping,
of course.

1:25:57.250 --> 1:26:00.790
-28, black, yoke.
-Excuse me.

1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:06.200
You old pig.

1:26:13.580 --> 1:26:17.290
- Ten each for the game.
-13, 17, 23 and the Chevaux.

1:26:23.330 --> 1:26:26.200
Here.  Give that to
the Lord and ask him...

1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:29.000
to change the money,
he gives you tokens,

1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.330
then you can play
along, my little one.

1:26:50.790 --> 1:26:53.790
You won!  Are you happy?

1:26:53.950 --> 1:26:55.330
Yes.

1:27:06.410 --> 1:27:08.200
<i>A//es to the ”29”.</i>

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.200
—29.  —29.

1:27:12.540 --> 1:27:15.000
Hermione, get chips.

1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:30.330
<i>26</i>

1:27:36.370 --> 1:27:38.830
Nothing works anymore.

1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:41.870
<i>Make your game.  Even number.</i>

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:34.540
Whoo...?

1:31:36.790 --> 1:31:38.500
H.uh.u

1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:43.540
HuhuH!

1:32:04.870 --> 1:32:06.500
Are you coming home now?

1:32:07.330 --> 1:32:08.410
Cursed.

1:32:12.290 --> 1:32:14.040
Cursed.

1:32:18.700 --> 1:32:20.370
you pig, you!

1:32:22.620 --> 1:32:26.790
-Okay, bye.
-Was he good, your kanake?

1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:30.290
1000 and 1 night.

1:32:33.500 --> 1:32:34.910
Here...

1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:39.330
For your ties.

1:33:04.450 --> 1:33:08.000
Hermione, I'm hungry.

1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:46.620
Sugar?  -Two .

1:33:54.250 --> 1:33:57.450
Many Thanks. Take a seat.

1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:38.160
And when Madame comes home?

1:34:55.830 --> 1:34:57.750
<i>The pie.</i>

1:35:00.700 --> 1:35:02.790
Music please, Maestro.

1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:10.160

1:35:20.620 --> 1:35:22.500
I baked the cake myself, Magali.

1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:29.040
Blow them all out at once!

1:35:29.330 --> 1:35:31.830
-There remains one...
-Then get married this year!

1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:33.290
What...

1:35:36.540 --> 1:35:38.370
-May I go again?
-Yes, go!

1:35:39.910 --> 1:35:41.450
Very good.

1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:06.080
I'm very tired.

1:36:07.950 --> 1:36:09.370
Good night!

1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:26.410
Magali?

1:36:27.540 --> 1:36:29.040
Oh thank you.

1:36:42.410 --> 1:36:43.870
How pretty!

1:36:44.250 --> 1:36:46.080
Do you like it?

1:36:51.500 --> 1:36:52.870
Do you like it?

1:37:35.950 --> 1:37:38.120
-Oh no!
-I'm going to sleep.

1:37:40.830 --> 1:37:42.290
<i>Good night.</i>

1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:01.080
Hermione, come on.

1:38:17.410 --> 1:38:19.290
Music!

1:38:30.950 --> 1:38:32.080
Maestro!

1:39:31.620 --> 1:39:33.950
You can't even waltz!

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:03.290
Catherine!  This is Catherine!

1:40:14.370 --> 1:40:16.870
-This is Catherine!
-I have not done anything!

1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:20.410
Such an idiot!

1:40:25.830 --> 1:40:27.080
This is Catherine.

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:48.330
This is Catherine.

1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:53.830
This is Catherine.

1:40:55.950 --> 1:41:00.370
This is Catherine.
You are to blame!  You are to blame!

1:41:00.580 --> 1:41:04.080
This is Catherine!
This is Catherine!

1:41:05.580 --> 1:41:07.660
Catherine!

1:41:08.830 --> 1:41:10.580

1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:13.790
Catherine.

1:41:15.450 --> 1:41:17.200
Catherine!

1:42:26.950 --> 1:42:28.370
They pay!

1:42:28.790 --> 1:42:30.620
The insurance companies pay.

1:42:31.330 --> 1:42:33.620
-Who do you pay?
-To you.

1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:36.620
Philomene Schmidt,
widowed Villette...

1:42:38.540 --> 1:42:40.660
and wife of Sarret.

1:42:54.790 --> 1:42:57.290
Isn't your little sister there?

1:42:59.450 --> 1:43:02.910
Danger!  Don't move anymore.

1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:08.200
Don't move.

1:43:09.910 --> 1:43:12.500
And a little smile.

1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:16.120
Thanks!
