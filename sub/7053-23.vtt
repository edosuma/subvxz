We have to get Peter back.

<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:04.775 --> 00:07.861
This technology has a
very recognizable design.

00:07.929 --> 00:10.157
This is William's technology,
but we didn't build it.

00:10.238 --> 00:12.657
Peter is in danger.
You have to help us cross over.

00:12.724 --> 00:15.887
We don't have a way to
cross over, but you do.

00:15.955 --> 00:18.950
We made it.
We're on the other side.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.804
Peter, I've missed you so much.

00:21.872 --> 00:23.781
Your father's so
pleased to see you.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.855
He asked me to give you this.

00:28.764 --> 00:33.371
<i>This is your team?</i>

00:33.439 --> 00:35.677
I understand you're
investigating a fringe event.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.112
<i>That's correct, sir.</i>

00:37.180 --> 00:39.950
<i>I have reason to believe
that these invaders</i>

00:40.018 --> 00:41.786
<i>Are anything but peaceful.</i>

00:41.854 --> 00:43.322
They must be found.

00:44.789 --> 00:45.987
Run, run, run!

00:46.055 --> 00:46.989
Hey!

00:48.126 --> 00:49.793
Hello, Olivia.

00:49.860 --> 00:53.129
Walter is in trouble,
and I'm quite confident

00:53.197 --> 00:54.897
We don't have much time.

03:11.047 --> 03:12.147
Hello, son.

03:15.652 --> 03:19.922
I've imagined this
moment so many times.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.725
I can't imagine how strange
it must be for you.

03:22.792 --> 03:25.861
I've seen the strange.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.065
But this...

03:29.133 --> 03:32.469
This is something else.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.676
<i>this is the last hospital
before the park.</i>

03:38.744 --> 03:39.844
If we don't find Walter here,

03:39.912 --> 03:41.779
We'll start heading uptown.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.080
Okay, well, how do you know that
he's not already in custody?

03:43.148 --> 03:45.115
I've checked with my sources
at homeland security.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.183
I don't believe Walternate's
people have found him yet.

03:47.251 --> 03:48.417
"Walternate"?

03:48.485 --> 03:49.951
It's a nickname Walter
gave him years ago.

03:50.019 --> 03:52.484
"Walternate." over here,
he's the secretary of defense.

03:52.552 --> 03:54.085
The fringe team answers to him.

03:54.152 --> 03:55.484
To Walter?

03:55.552 --> 03:57.585
I know it takes a little
getting used to, doesn't it?

03:57.652 --> 03:59.218
<i>okay, we're gonna have to
refer to the chart.</i>

03:59.286 --> 04:00.716
Excuse me.
How big were the bees?

04:00.784 --> 04:02.983
This big? Bigger
than a grapefruit?

04:03.051 --> 04:04.284
Excuse me-- hey, pal!

04:04.350 --> 04:06.150
If you ain't bleeding,
back of the line.

04:08.587 --> 04:10.687
Excuse me, sir,
I-- I didn't realize.

04:10.755 --> 04:11.955
That's quite all right.

04:12.023 --> 04:14.023
<i>I believe a friend of mine
is being treated here.</i>

04:14.090 --> 04:15.323

please?</i>

04:15.390 --> 04:16.690
Bell.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.458
Sir?

04:19.526 --> 04:21.358
You go. I'll buy you some time.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.493
You find Walter.

04:22.561 --> 04:23.827
I'll meet you in
the parking lot.

04:23.895 --> 04:25.762
I'm sorry.

04:25.830 --> 04:26.796
A misunderstanding.

04:26.864 --> 04:28.664
okay.

04:37.940 --> 04:38.939
<i>give me a second.</i>

04:39.007 --> 04:40.174
I'll find him for you.

04:40.242 --> 04:41.541
We're also gonna need
his medical files

04:41.609 --> 04:43.009
Purged from the system.

04:43.077 --> 04:45.145
Fringe authorization.

04:49.716 --> 04:51.017
I purged his file.

04:51.084 --> 04:52.018
He's in bed 18.

04:52.086 --> 04:53.019
Thanks.

04:53.087 --> 04:54.521
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

04:54.588 --> 04:56.722
Don't I know you from somewhere?

04:56.790 --> 04:58.824
I--I have it. You're agents.

04:58.892 --> 05:00.525
Fringe division.
You work for the secretary.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.228
Sorry, sir,
we're in a bit of a rush.

05:02.295 --> 05:03.262
I'd imagine you would be.

05:03.330 --> 05:04.764
Chaotic times, aren't they?

05:04.832 --> 05:05.798
Chaotic times indeed.

05:05.866 --> 05:06.832
I'm terribly sorry.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.934
The secretary and
I are old friends.

05:09.002 --> 05:10.635
I'm William bell.

05:10.703 --> 05:13.738
I see you're carrying
76 pulse side arms.

05:13.806 --> 05:15.206
I designed those, you know.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.174
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr.
Bell, but we have to--

05:17.242 --> 05:19.776
The 76 models don't
have the pha repeater.

05:19.844 --> 05:21.244
That's a design flaw.

05:21.311 --> 05:22.244
Walter.

05:22.312 --> 05:23.312
Olivia.

05:25.649 --> 05:27.717
It is you, isn't it?

05:27.784 --> 05:29.252
Yes, Walter.

05:29.319 --> 05:30.519
Prove it.

05:30.587 --> 05:33.055
Come on, Walter.
We don't have time for this.

05:33.123 --> 05:35.291
Ah...Yes, it is you.

05:35.359 --> 05:36.359
That's wonderful. Hi.

05:36.426 --> 05:37.894
Hi.

05:37.961 --> 05:39.662
They also don't have
the pulse function.

05:39.729 --> 05:41.830
Which I am putting in the 77.

05:41.898 --> 05:43.532
Excuse me, sir.

05:49.235 --> 05:51.902
Okay. Walter, can you walk?

05:51.970 --> 05:53.470
I can dance, if you like.

05:53.538 --> 05:56.540
They have absolutely
fabulous drugs here, Olivia.

05:56.608 --> 05:58.642
I feel great.
Oh, and look, look, look.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.810
Accelerated healing techniques.

06:00.878 --> 06:02.111
It--it's miraculous.

06:02.179 --> 06:03.477
Okay, come on, Walter.

06:03.545 --> 06:05.412
Bell's waiting for us.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.647
Bell is here?

06:06.714 --> 06:08.448
Yes. Yes, he is.

06:08.515 --> 06:11.082
That's nice of him
to finally show up.

06:15.985 --> 06:17.119
Here.

06:19.555 --> 06:20.589
Clothes are gone.

06:22.425 --> 06:23.458
He was wounded.

06:23.526 --> 06:24.659
I'll lock down the hospital.

06:24.727 --> 06:25.793
Are you looking for something?

06:25.861 --> 06:28.095
I need the security footage
for this unit. Now.

06:37.771 --> 06:38.870
Hello, William.

06:38.938 --> 06:40.571
Walter. I see you've aged.

06:40.639 --> 06:42.272
It appears I'm not the only one.

06:42.340 --> 06:44.140
Get in, Walter.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.508
Ohh.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.460
<i>Hey.</i>

07:08.528 --> 07:10.428
You okay?

07:10.496 --> 07:12.597

Fringe - 2x23 "Over There"
Aired on may 20, 2010

07:40.154 --> 07:42.088
Thank you.

07:42.156 --> 07:43.123
What's the red?

07:43.190 --> 07:46.958
That's the quarantine areas.

07:47.026 --> 07:48.993
Boston?

07:49.061 --> 07:49.994
Most all of them.

07:51.296 --> 07:54.497
Because of what that man did.

07:54.565 --> 07:55.899
The man who stole you.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.203
That's a lot of blame to
place on just one man.

08:01.271 --> 08:04.172
It's true, I'm afraid.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.641
When our two universes
first interacted,

08:06.708 --> 08:09.443
It caused soft spots
on the other side.

08:09.511 --> 08:12.579
But it was much worse here.

08:12.647 --> 08:17.416
The laws of physics were
turned into mere suggestions.

08:17.483 --> 08:19.850
But I'm hoping you
can change all that.

08:19.918 --> 08:21.618
I don't know what
you heard about me,

08:21.686 --> 08:24.320
But...Changing the
laws of physics

08:24.388 --> 08:26.521
Might be slightly
above my abilities.

08:29.224 --> 08:31.591
That's fair enough.

08:31.659 --> 08:34.293
But there have been

08:34.361 --> 08:35.626
Breakthroughs on
the the other side

08:35.695 --> 08:37.195
In science and
engineering that--

08:37.261 --> 08:39.462
That we haven't achieved yet.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.898
And these are things
that you understand.

08:44.967 --> 08:46.601
The schematic I left
with your mother...

08:46.669 --> 08:49.871
Yeah, I looked at them, and...

08:49.938 --> 08:52.375
Whatever it is, it's unlike
anything I've ever seen before.

08:52.442 --> 08:54.944
So what is it?

08:55.012 --> 08:57.680
It's very old tech.

08:57.747 --> 08:59.681
It's something that...

08:59.749 --> 09:00.948
I believe can be applied

09:01.016 --> 09:03.384
To heal the problems
of this world...

09:03.452 --> 09:05.655
<i>Of your world.</i>

09:05.723 --> 09:10.398
I've replaced missing
parts with new equipment,

09:10.466 --> 09:13.402
But, unfortunately,
it still doesn't work.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.872
My engineers tell
me that the problem

09:16.940 --> 09:22.710
Probably lies in
the power source.

09:22.778 --> 09:24.712
I was hoping that you
would have a look at it.

09:24.780 --> 09:27.448
Of course I would.

09:27.516 --> 09:31.919
Peter, I know it wasn't easy--

09:31.987 --> 09:34.455
Making the choice to come home.

09:37.359 --> 09:40.226
But I'm very glad you did.

09:40.294 --> 09:42.161
<i>Sir, Agent Dunham is here.</i>

09:42.229 --> 09:43.430
She doesn't have an appointment.

09:43.497 --> 09:46.465
Tell her-- Olivia's here?

09:46.533 --> 09:47.565
Send her in.

09:57.237 --> 09:58.937
Agent Dunham.

09:59.005 --> 10:00.371
Sir. This is Peter.

10:00.439 --> 10:01.406
Sir.

10:01.473 --> 10:03.340
<i>Thank you, major.</i>

10:10.680 --> 10:12.414
Do I have something in my teeth?

10:12.481 --> 10:15.649
No, you remind me
of somebody I know.

10:15.717 --> 10:18.017
<i>But your hair is different.</i>

10:22.156 --> 10:24.124
Think I like yours better.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.459
<i>would you excuse us,
please, Peter?</i>

10:26.527 --> 10:29.696
I need to speak to Agent Dunham.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.502
I'll be out in a moment
to show you around.

10:39.235 --> 10:40.468
Agent.

10:40.536 --> 10:41.870
Uh, we lost him

10:41.937 --> 10:43.638
At the hospital, sir.

10:43.706 --> 10:45.306
We think he had help escaping.

10:45.374 --> 10:46.640
That's not why
you're here, is it?

10:46.708 --> 10:48.142
Uh, no, it is not.

10:48.209 --> 10:49.643
I told you there
would be invaders

10:49.711 --> 10:50.944
Coming over from the other side,

10:51.012 --> 10:52.545
But I didn't tell you
they would be us.

10:52.613 --> 10:55.080
No, you did not.

10:57.050 --> 10:58.751
They're our doubles,

10:58.818 --> 11:00.352
Alternate version of ourselves,

11:00.420 --> 11:01.886
<i>But don't be deceived, Olivia.</i>

11:01.954 --> 11:04.122
<i>They're monsters in our skin.</i>

11:04.189 --> 11:06.424
They'll do anything,
say anything to gain our trust,

11:06.491 --> 11:08.592
But they can't be trusted.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.295
That man.

11:12.363 --> 11:13.796
He knows me.

11:13.864 --> 11:15.864
Or her.

11:15.932 --> 11:17.365
That's why he was staring at me.

11:17.433 --> 11:20.201
Is he from the other side?

11:20.269 --> 11:22.903
That man...Is my son.

11:22.971 --> 11:24.571
Peter.

11:24.639 --> 11:26.773
Your son who was
kidnapped 20 years ago?

11:26.840 --> 11:28.541
Yes.

11:28.609 --> 11:30.042
Kidnapped by them.

11:35.281 --> 11:37.248
Agent...

11:37.316 --> 11:42.019
May I ask a favor of you?

11:42.086 --> 11:44.220
They had cameras everywhere.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.490
We must be on the hospital
surveillance tapes.

11:47.558 --> 11:49.458
Which means we are fugitives.

11:49.526 --> 11:51.893
Double breaded for a big crunch.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.595
It's so good.

11:53.663 --> 11:56.597
Tastes just like on our side.

11:56.665 --> 11:59.766
It was Wednesday, 1983,

11:59.834 --> 12:02.001
When I happened to identify

12:02.069 --> 12:04.737
The last of the 11
secret herbs and spices.

12:04.805 --> 12:06.539
Walter...

12:06.606 --> 12:08.240
Okay.

12:08.308 --> 12:09.941
I think that we should split up.

12:10.009 --> 12:12.110
I can look for Peter
faster if I'm on my own.

12:12.178 --> 12:14.212
We have a larger pro.

12:14.279 --> 12:16.980
Without Mr. Lane and the others,

12:17.048 --> 12:19.082
We won't be able to
cross back to our side.

12:19.150 --> 12:22.085
Olivia can still open the door.

12:22.152 --> 12:23.920
That's her gift, is it not?

12:23.987 --> 12:26.655
<i>I don't know how much of a toll</i>

12:26.723 --> 12:28.824
Crossing over took on her.

12:28.892 --> 12:31.793
You may be able to open a crack,

12:31.861 --> 12:33.995
But without the others
to enhance your power--

12:34.063 --> 12:35.930
That's it, then.

12:35.997 --> 12:37.331
What?

12:37.399 --> 12:38.966
We need a doorstop.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.635
Something to hold the door open

12:41.702 --> 12:46.071
<i>Where Olivia has already
provided a crack.</i>

12:46.139 --> 12:48.473
You could build one, Walter.
A doorstop!

12:48.541 --> 12:50.275
No... No, no, no, no.

12:50.343 --> 12:52.243
For starters, I'd need
a particle accelerator.

12:52.311 --> 12:53.644
I don't think they
exactly sell those

12:53.712 --> 12:54.979
At the local drugstore.

12:55.046 --> 12:56.013
no.

12:56.081 --> 12:57.915
But I think I know
where we could get one.

12:57.982 --> 13:00.050
oh! Oh, of course.

13:00.117 --> 13:01.985
I'm sure you opened
massive dynamic

13:02.086 --> 13:03.086
<i>On this side as well.</i>

13:03.153 --> 13:04.554
As a matter of fact, I did not.
I did not--

13:04.621 --> 13:05.621
<i>To get rich and famous</i>

13:05.689 --> 13:07.556
While I was rotting
away in a padded cell.

13:07.624 --> 13:08.890
<i>Walter, will you please-- hey!</i>

13:10.860 --> 13:12.994
Come on, you can work
this out another time.

13:13.062 --> 13:14.529
<i>Okay, Walter...</i>

13:14.596 --> 13:15.763
<i>You build a doorstop,</i>

13:15.831 --> 13:16.931
If you can.

13:16.998 --> 13:18.098
I'm gonna go look for Peter.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.366
Now do you have a cell phone?

13:19.434 --> 13:21.768
They monitor all the
communications networks.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.236
That's probably how they
knew about central park.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.272
It's safest if we don't try to
communicate with one another.

13:27.339 --> 13:30.340
We'll meet back at the
opera house in 12 hours.

13:30.408 --> 13:32.542
Okay. Be careful.

13:34.579 --> 13:37.981
We've accomplished a
lot together, Walter.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.316
But she may be our
greatest achievement.

13:42.185 --> 13:44.687
Hmm.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.264
the secretary thinks
you'll be comfortable here.

13:56.034 --> 13:57.668
Thanks.

13:57.735 --> 14:00.737
So, uh, it's UV-proof glass.

14:00.804 --> 14:04.306
Uh, state-of-the-art
anti-fire tech.

14:04.374 --> 14:06.875
There's viral purging,

14:06.943 --> 14:08.210
<i>Air filtration,</i>

14:08.244 --> 14:11.679
And there's a gym
and a pool upstairs.

14:11.747 --> 14:14.115
<i>The secretary's gonna send a car
to pick you up at 8:00,</i>

14:14.182 --> 14:15.282
<i>Take you to dinner.</i>

14:19.353 --> 14:20.853
What was it like
on the other side?

14:22.623 --> 14:24.256
Secretary told me.

14:27.427 --> 14:30.595
A lot like it is here.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.429
Just...

14:34.499 --> 14:36.870
Slightly different.

14:36.938 --> 14:39.105
It's subtle,
but definitely different.

14:42.308 --> 14:45.510
You know, when people find
out that you're back...

14:45.578 --> 14:47.078
You're gonna be famous.

14:47.146 --> 14:49.080
What do you mean?

14:49.147 --> 14:50.581
Well, your kidnapping.

14:50.649 --> 14:51.882
It's a famous story.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.483
So I'm like the Lindbergh baby?

14:53.551 --> 14:54.618
The what?

14:58.488 --> 14:59.822
Nothing.

15:06.361 --> 15:09.062
What's she like?

15:09.130 --> 15:11.298
Who?

15:11.365 --> 15:12.365
Me.

15:15.569 --> 15:18.070
She's a lot like you.

15:18.138 --> 15:20.639
<i>Darker in the eyes, maybe.</i>

15:22.975 --> 15:25.576
She's always trying to
make up for something.

15:25.644 --> 15:27.712
Right some imaginary wrong.

15:30.215 --> 15:32.816
Haunted, I guess.

15:39.722 --> 15:41.890
Maybe she's nothing
like you at all.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.894
Thanks for the ride.

15:46.962 --> 15:47.995
Of course.

16:02.808 --> 16:06.577
Am I responsible for this?

16:09.981 --> 16:12.816
I'm afraid you are.

16:59.599 --> 17:01.267
Of course.

17:06.073 --> 17:08.741
At one time,

17:08.907 --> 17:10.842
Walternate was intent
on finding a means

17:10.910 --> 17:13.045
To cross between universes.

17:13.112 --> 17:15.513
Just as you were.

17:16.549 --> 17:18.215
<i>Heidn't succeed, but...</i>

17:18.284 --> 17:21.220
It stands to reason
the technology we need

17:21.287 --> 17:22.854
Might  here.

17:22.922 --> 17:25.022
Didn't walternate work with you?

17:25.090 --> 17:27.559
Or, rather, the William
be from this side?

17:27.627 --> 17:29.828
Walternate? No.

17:29.896 --> 17:32.331
It seems that William
bell on this side

17:32.399 --> 17:34.567
<i>Was killed in a car accident
as a young man.</i>

17:34.635 --> 17:36.836
Over here...

17:36.903 --> 17:40.573
The other you and the other me

17:40.641 --> 17:42.208
Ner had occasion to meet.

17:42.275 --> 17:44.143
What a shame

17:44.211 --> 17:46.379
Imagine how much money
you could have made

17:46.447 --> 17:47.580
If there were two of you.

17:52.048 --> 17:54.943
Creating massive dynamic

17:55.011 --> 17:57.506
Was not my idea, Walter.

17:57.574 --> 18:00.669
We both talked about borrowing
this world's technologies

18:00.737 --> 18:01.835
To help our own.

18:01.903 --> 18:04.668
You didn't help the world,
William.

18:04.736 --> 18:06.768
You helped yourself.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.970
You pilfered this
world for profit.

18:10.038 --> 18:11.369
As a byproduct, yes.

18:11.437 --> 18:12.502
Let's remember,

18:12.570 --> 18:14.137
The only reason I
came back over here

18:14.204 --> 18:15.471
Was to prevent a war.

18:15.539 --> 18:17.173
<i>And to stop a chain of events</i>

18:17.206 --> 18:20.241
Set into motion the
day you stole Peter!

18:20.308 --> 18:23.309
A little truth, if you please.

18:23.377 --> 18:24.877
You say you want
to prevent the war

18:24.945 --> 18:26.845
While you quietly fuel it.

18:26.913 --> 18:29.681
<i>I know th you helped craft</i>

18:29.749 --> 18:30.782
The shapeshifters.

18:30.849 --> 18:33.017
Your design signature
is all over it.

18:33.085 --> 18:35.486
I had little choice.

18:35.553 --> 18:38.021
If I wanted to keep
tabs on walternate,

18:38.089 --> 18:39.689
I had to remain valuable to him.

18:43.960 --> 18:47.495
I've lost...17 years

18:47.563 --> 18:51.466
In a mental institution,
William.

18:51.534 --> 18:53.234
17 years!

18:54.670 --> 18:56.270
And even now, I'm--

18:56.337 --> 18:57.838
I'm still incomplete.

18:57.906 --> 19:00.109
I forget things.

19:00.176 --> 19:02.044
Uh, names.

19:02.111 --> 19:03.678
Places.

19:03.746 --> 19:06.447
Connections that I used to
be able to make so easily.

19:06.515 --> 19:08.415
They just-- they just dangle,

19:08.483 --> 19:10.450
Just outside of my reach.

19:13.754 --> 19:15.888
<i>I know what you did to me.</i>

19:15.955 --> 19:19.090
I know that you cut out
pieces of my brain.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.224
Walter--

19:20.292 --> 19:21.925
<i>What kind of man could do that?</i>

19:21.993 --> 19:24.927
You robbed me of my
memories of my wife,

19:24.995 --> 19:27.063
Of my son, of my past!

19:27.130 --> 19:28.197
Walter!

19:32.235 --> 19:34.436
<i>I believe you've found what
we're looking for.</i>

19:41.275 --> 19:43.242
We should get started.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.797
Hmm.

20:26.345 --> 20:27.478
How did you--

20:27.546 --> 20:29.447
We both leave our hide-a-key
in the same place.

20:33.152 --> 20:34.918
This should do.

20:34.986 --> 20:37.787
With some modifications,
this should act as a doorstop.

20:37.854 --> 20:38.921
Yes.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.722
Now, we need to simultaneously

20:41.790 --> 20:43.190
Amply and limit

20:43.257 --> 20:45.191
The molecular
destabilization margins.

20:45.258 --> 20:48.193
Well, we should try not
to electrocute everyone

20:48.260 --> 20:49.427
In the process.

20:50.496 --> 20:52.796
Well...This will reopen

20:52.864 --> 20:54.831
The crack in the door.

20:54.899 --> 20:56.666
But without the others,
I'm not sure

20:56.734 --> 20:58.734
That Olivia will
be strong enough

20:58.802 --> 20:59.934
To keep it open.

21:00.002 --> 21:02.035
Well...

21:02.103 --> 21:04.370
Leave that to me.

21:08.273 --> 21:11.441
Now, I need your help.

21:11.508 --> 21:13.042
Well, you have a
funny way of asking.

21:13.110 --> 21:16.544
Okay, I need you to
take me to Peter bishop.

21:16.612 --> 21:18.278
I assume that you
know where he is.

21:21.915 --> 21:22.881
Don't.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.482
It's getting heavy.

21:33.422 --> 21:34.422
Is that mom?

21:35.757 --> 21:37.658
Yeah.

21:37.726 --> 21:39.226
She's alive?

21:42.562 --> 21:44.027
What is she like?

21:46.497 --> 21:49.366
Well, the last few years
have been hard for her

21:54.816 --> 21:57.357
My sister died
during childbirth.

22:01.969 --> 22:03.438
You have a sister too?

22:05.943 --> 22:08.213
And a niece.

22:08.281 --> 22:09.281
Ella.

22:09.349 --> 22:11.151
She's seven.

22:11.219 --> 22:12.820
Ella.

22:18.223 --> 22:21.092
I need to speak to Peter bishop.

22:21.159 --> 22:22.559
He's in danger here,

22:22.627 --> 22:23.794
And he needs to understand that.

22:29.231 --> 22:31.232
This isn't just an
assignment,s it?

22:33.435 --> 22:36.537
Are you two a couple?

22:36.605 --> 22:37.972
is that what this is about

22:38.040 --> 22:43.244
Please, I need to speak to him.

22:43.345 --> 22:45.245
You gotta trust me.

22:45.313 --> 22:47.281
I'm you.

22:49.217 --> 22:51.285
You haven't answered
my question.

22:51.352 --> 22:52.853
What question?

22:52.921 --> 22:55.622
Why did you remove my memories?

22:58.125 --> 22:59.326
I had my reasons

22:59.393 --> 23:00.326
Belly...

23:00.394 --> 23:01.494
Walter...

23:01.562 --> 23:04.564
Let the past be the past.

23:04.632 --> 23:07.467
We have less than four
hours to get back.

23:07.535 --> 23:08.668
<i>We should go.</i>

23:25.918 --> 23:28.819
Will you help me?

23:28.886 --> 23:30.018
Okay.

23:30.086 --> 23:32.715
Okay.

23:34.017 --> 23:35.416
Stop. Stop.

23:39.521 --> 23:41.656
I was just getting my keys.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.158
Put it down.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.527
You ep your backup gun
in your purse, don't you?

24:03.762 --> 24:05.162
I keep mine in my jacket.

24:15.296 --> 24:19.167
Now put your gun slowly
down on the table.

24:33.219 --> 24:36.894
I thought we had an agreement.

24:36.962 --> 24:38.629
You know, I don't
know what you are,

24:38.697 --> 24:40.631
But you are nothin' like me.

24:42.435 --> 24:44.203
You know, he was right.

24:47.544 --> 24:49.145
Call fringe. This is Dunham.

24:49.213 --> 24:50.647
Uhh!

24:52.282 --> 24:53.582
Uhh! Uhh!

25:02.894 --> 25:03.927
Uhh!

25:05.830 --> 25:06.963
Uhh!

25:18.841 --> 25:20.807
Uhh! Unh!

25:41.891 --> 25:43.057
Uhh!

26:43.997 --> 26:45.030
<i>Hey, Liv.</i>

26:47.500 --> 26:49.467
I tried your cuff
a couple of times.

26:49.535 --> 26:50.535
Everything okay?

26:50.602 --> 26:54.267
Yeah.

26:54.335 --> 26:57.032
What's up, Charlie?

26:57.100 --> 27:00.436
Got a power surge at the
secretary's old lab.

27:00.504 --> 27:03.505
So Broyles wants us to
go and check it out.

27:03.573 --> 27:04.940
You sure you're okay?

27:06.575 --> 27:08.043
The secretary just called.

27:08.111 --> 27:10.813
He, uh, he wants us
to move Peter bishop.

27:10.914 --> 27:12.481
Apparently,
he's not safe where he is.

27:12.549 --> 27:13.882
They found Peter bishop?

27:13.950 --> 27:15.584
Yeah.

27:17.253 --> 27:18.253
Huh.

27:21.690 --> 27:24.057
<i>object is totally unresponsive.</i>

27:24.124 --> 27:25.658
<i>But there's nothing
wrong with it.</i>

27:25.726 --> 27:28.928
There's no...Obvious
damage to the structure.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.294
And yet...

27:31.361 --> 27:33.725
Somehow it just
feels incomplete.

27:39.129 --> 27:40.462
All right, this is
gonna sound crazy.

27:40.529 --> 27:42.263
In fact...

27:42.331 --> 27:43.264
This is kind of crazy.

27:43.332 --> 27:46.633
But what if...

27:46.701 --> 27:48.869
The object was
symbiotic in nature?

27:48.936 --> 27:51.704
Which is to say that it
wasn't entirely mechanical,

27:51.772 --> 27:54.573
That it needed some sort of...

27:54.640 --> 27:56.107
So sort

27:56.175 --> 27:58.109
Organic interface?

28:11.190 --> 28:12.857
so how much do you know?

28:12.925 --> 28:15.793
How did they find him?

28:15.861 --> 28:18.061
I don't know.

28:18.129 --> 28:19.562
Wow.

28:19.630 --> 28:22.564
After all these years.

28:22.632 --> 28:24.900
Can you imagine when the
tabloids get hold of this?

28:24.967 --> 28:27.268
You know, I think it
has something to do

28:27.335 --> 28:30.470
With why these people have
come from the other side.

28:30.538 --> 28:33.173
Yeah, I suppose so.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.540
Have we got any new leads?

28:34.608 --> 28:36.575
No, nothing new.

28:36.643 --> 28:38.944
<i>I gotta tell you, Livvy,</i>

28:39.012 --> 28:41.913
This job isn't what
it was ten years ago.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.082
<i>You got alternate universes.</i>

28:45.150 --> 28:46.784
I an, it just--

28:46.851 --> 28:49.919
Just wasn't part of
my training, you know?

28:50.021 --> 28:53.957
I mean, how are we supposed
to fight these people?

28:54.025 --> 28:56.124
<i>Truth is, Livvy,</i>

28:56.192 --> 28:58.526
This makes me feel obsolete,
you know?

29:16.473 --> 29:19.006
The parameters are human...

29:19.074 --> 29:21.374
A reflection of
the human genome.

29:21.442 --> 29:23.408
The spectrum isn't random.

29:23.476 --> 29:25.076
In fact, the specificity
of the configuration

29:25.144 --> 29:27.708
Would seem to suggest
that the object

29:27.776 --> 29:30.772
Would only respond to
a subset of people.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.842
And a narrow subset at that.

29:35.811 --> 29:38.112
A subset of one.

29:42.751 --> 29:44.185
Me.

29:54.168 --> 29:55.806
Charlie Francis.

29:55.874 --> 29:58.310
Peter Bishop.

29:58.378 --> 30:00.280
It's pleasure to meet you.

30:00.347 --> 30:02.114
<i>Come on in. What can I
do for you guys?</i>

30:02.182 --> 30:03.516
Uh, Mr. Bishop,

30:03.584 --> 30:04.784
We're concerned for your safety.

30:04.852 --> 30:05.820
What's this?

30:05.887 --> 30:06.855
This was given to me

30:06.923 --> 30:07.990
<i>By an acquaintance of
your father.</i>

30:08.057 --> 30:10.058
<i>An observer.</i>

30:10.126 --> 30:11.126
An observer?

30:11.193 --> 30:12.260
He gave it to me, I think,

30:12.327 --> 30:13.828
To warm me about what
would happen to you

30:13.895 --> 30:15.362
If you ever returned here.

30:15.430 --> 30:17.163
<i>What's going on?
He wants you to know</i>

30:17.231 --> 30:18.230
That your friends are here

30:18.298 --> 30:19.899
And that they have
come to keep you safe.

30:19.966 --> 30:21.934
<i>Hey, Liv, what the hell are
you talking about?</i>

30:26.105 --> 30:27.171
oh, God.

30:27.239 --> 30:28.338
Peter, it's me.

30:28.406 --> 30:30.640
Thanks, I think I
just figured that out.

30:35.814 --> 30:37.214
He lied to me.

30:37.282 --> 30:39.881
He told me I could heal the
problems of this world.

30:39.949 --> 30:42.283
My father told me that all
the problems out there

30:42.351 --> 30:44.986
Started when Walter
came over and stole me.

30:45.053 --> 30:46.286
And that, now that I was back,

30:46.354 --> 30:48.088
I was gonna be able
to help to fix it.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.290
But his bringing me back

30:51.357 --> 30:54.526
Was never about
fixing this universe.

30:54.593 --> 30:56.761
It was about destroying yours.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.900
I'm sorry.

31:08.470 --> 31:09.772
How long did you know?

31:13.278 --> 31:14.311
A few weeks.

31:18.115 --> 31:20.051
Peter, I-- don't worry.

31:20.119 --> 31:22.287
I'm not gonna let them do this.

31:22.354 --> 31:23.888
I don't think that he can.

31:23.956 --> 31:25.256
I mean, not without you.

31:31.096 --> 31:36.033
Peter...

31:36.101 --> 31:37.368
You don't belong here.

31:39.137 --> 31:41.005
No, I don't belong here.

31:46.545 --> 31:48.079
But I don't belong there,
either.

31:49.614 --> 31:51.148
Yes, you do.

31:59.525 --> 32:02.761
I have thought of 100 reasons...

32:02.829 --> 32:04.029
Why you should come back.

32:04.097 --> 32:06.833
To--to fight the shapeshifters,

32:06.901 --> 32:10.404
To take care of Walter,
to--to save the world.

32:10.472 --> 32:13.541
But in the end...

32:16.512 --> 32:18.280
You have to come back.

32:22.885 --> 32:25.922
Because you belong with me.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.621
Colonel Broyles, listen up.

32:50.688 --> 32:51.956
I need everyone's
attention, now!

32:52.024 --> 32:54.726
Mr. Secretary. I want all
surveillance retasked

32:54.794 --> 32:55.927
To find a fugitive.

32:55.994 --> 32:57.127
What fugitive, sir?

32:57.193 --> 32:59.126
Me.

33:03.528 --> 33:05.193
I've got her;
her show me just passed

33:05.261 --> 33:07.294
The auto scan
checkpoint at sector 47.

33:07.361 --> 33:10.698
They're heading back
to the opera house.

33:10.765 --> 33:12.867
All right, people, let's move.
This is not a drill.

33:12.934 --> 33:15.035
<i>they should be here by now.</i>

33:15.103 --> 33:16.136
They'll be here.

33:16.204 --> 33:18.605
Help me get this thing inside.

33:18.672 --> 33:20.073
Walter!

33:20.140 --> 33:21.941
Oh, okay.

33:39.622 --> 33:40.622
<i>hello, Peter.</i>

33:40.689 --> 33:42.456
<i>I'm William bell.</i>

33:42.524 --> 33:44.958
Haven't seen you in many years.

33:45.026 --> 33:47.660
You're holding up better
than I would have thought.

33:47.728 --> 33:50.663
What's a little universe
hopping between friends?

33:50.731 --> 33:52.098
That's not what I meant.

33:52.167 --> 33:53.100
<i>Okay, so what do we do?</i>

33:55.671 --> 33:57.404
Peter, help your
father get this device

33:57.472 --> 33:58.439
Inside and powered up.

33:58.506 --> 33:59.740
Olivia and I will hold them off.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.982
I supplied fringe division
with the 76 model.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.793
This is the 77.

34:23.860 --> 34:24.860
Come on.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.864
Peter, I don't even
know where to begin.

34:28.933 --> 34:32.232
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.300
How do we do this, Walter?

34:43.077 --> 34:44.377
Phosphorous grenades.

34:44.445 --> 34:45.511
Be careful.

34:45.579 --> 34:47.545
They're prototypes.
They could be unstable.

34:47.612 --> 34:48.812
What do you mean, unstable?

34:48.879 --> 34:49.978
Just try not to jostle them.

34:55.284 --> 34:56.551
Cover me.

35:10.425 --> 35:11.658
Ready?

35:20.757 --> 35:22.757
We move on my mark.

35:29.728 --> 35:30.828
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

35:34.265 --> 35:35.398
I understand.

35:44.773 --> 35:45.773
Damn it.

35:49.043 --> 35:50.009
<i>Dr. Bell!</i>

35:50.077 --> 35:52.577
Get down!

35:57.082 --> 35:59.183
Dr. Bell.

35:59.251 --> 36:00.351
Can you hear me?

36:00.418 --> 36:02.052
Dr. Bell.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.387
<i>Ohh.</i>

36:05.589 --> 36:06.788
Thank God. What happened?

36:06.856 --> 36:09.022
Uhh.

36:10.089 --> 36:12.723
I, uh...

36:12.791 --> 36:14.591
I used a grenade.

36:14.659 --> 36:17.860
<i>I think I bought us a
few minutes.</i>

36:18.928 --> 36:20.662
Come on.

36:23.265 --> 36:25.199
<i>Walter, they're here.</i>

36:25.267 --> 36:27.835
Is it working?

36:27.902 --> 36:29.303
Yes.

36:29.370 --> 36:30.871
It's opening a
crack in the door,

36:30.939 --> 36:32.706
But we don't have enough
power to keep it open.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.175
Yes, we can do it. We can't.

36:35.242 --> 36:36.442
Olivia doesn't have the power,

36:36.510 --> 36:37.777
And--and I haven't
thought of a solution.

36:37.845 --> 36:39.912
Walter--- please don't
argue with me, William!

36:39.980 --> 36:42.248
Always thinking you're
smarter than me.

36:42.315 --> 36:44.984
Walter, I will be the power.

36:45.051 --> 36:48.019
I've traveled between
universes so many times,

36:48.086 --> 36:49.386
My atoms are ready
to split apart

36:49.454 --> 36:51.553
With the slightest provocation.

36:51.621 --> 36:55.122
You taught me there are as
many atoms in the human body

36:55.190 --> 36:57.192
As there are stars in the sky.

36:57.260 --> 37:00.863
That's how many atom bombs I am.

37:00.931 --> 37:03.168
That should be enough
power to get you home.

37:12.181 --> 37:14.481
I should never have doubted you.

37:14.549 --> 37:15.616
It's okay, Walter.

37:15.683 --> 37:17.484
You always were as stubborn

37:17.552 --> 37:19.620
As a donkey with a
nail in his head.

37:21.222 --> 37:23.189
Walter, start the sequence.

37:32.627 --> 37:34.396
Thank you, old friend.

37:34.464 --> 37:37.365
Walter...

37:37.432 --> 37:40.867
You asked me why I took
out part of your brain.

37:40.935 --> 37:43.569
<i>I did it because you
asked me to.</i>

37:43.637 --> 37:45.837
Because of what
you were becoming.

37:49.441 --> 37:51.975
<i>freeze!</i>

38:08.856 --> 38:10.458
<i>welcome back.</i>

38:54.768 --> 38:55.968
Seriously?

38:56.035 --> 38:57.669
This is the third piece, Astrid.

38:57.737 --> 38:58.870
Are you trying to kill me?

39:00.406 --> 39:02.474
I'm sorry.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.142
When I'm nervous, I cook.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.177
And I've been baking
pies for about a week.

39:06.245 --> 39:09.283
Pies and muffins and cakes.

39:09.351 --> 39:10.286
And I've been
eating them all too,

39:10.354 --> 39:11.388
So don't be surprised

39:11.456 --> 39:12.890
When I send you a
bill for my lap band.

39:16.428 --> 39:19.463
I'm sorry I make you nervous.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.432
That's okay.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.267
At least you're back.

39:30.776 --> 39:32.910
You mind giving
Walter a ride home?

39:32.978 --> 39:34.612
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

39:34.679 --> 39:35.978
Sure.

39:40.876 --> 39:42.108
Good night, Walter.

39:42.175 --> 39:44.908
Peter...

39:44.975 --> 39:47.910
You are back now, aren't you?

39:47.978 --> 39:49.678
You're--you're not
leaving again?

39:52.882 --> 39:55.650
I'm trying to see
this your way, Walter.

39:57.453 --> 39:59.219
I can't.

40:04.293 --> 40:06.794
But...

40:06.862 --> 40:10.097
You did cross universes
twice to save my life.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.935
So that's gotta count
for something, right?

40:18.473 --> 40:20.841
Thank you, Peter.

40:24.941 --> 40:26.808
My son.

40:41.082 --> 40:42.415
Help you, gorgeous?

40:42.483 --> 40:44.383
I hope so.

40:44.451 --> 40:46.318
I'm looking for a typewriter.

40:47.453 --> 40:48.386
Well, you're in luck.

40:48.454 --> 40:50.321
A Selectric.

40:50.389 --> 40:51.489
Model 251.

40:53.858 --> 40:56.059
I see.

41:01.097 --> 41:02.964
It's in the back.

42:29.432 --> 42:32.133
please let me out of here.

42:37.442 --> 42:40.712
I know you can hear me!

42:40.780 --> 42:43.081
Please...

42:44.217 --> 42:45.384
Please let me out of here.

42:46.753 --> 42:48.353
I know you can hear me!

42:48.421 --> 42:51.023
Please let me out of here!

42:51.090 --> 42:53.559
No, no, no.

42:53.626 --> 42:55.125
No! No! No!
