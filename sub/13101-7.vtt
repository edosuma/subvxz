00:34.958 --> 00:36.583
[all cheering]

00:36.667 --> 00:38.667
(Sheridan)
Captain's personal log.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.083
[instrumental music]

00:40.167 --> 00:42.292
The Shadow War is over.

00:44.167 --> 00:45.583
We won.

00:49.167 --> 00:52.208
[music continues]

01:01.708 --> 01:04.750
[all cheering]

01:17.625 --> 01:20.625
(Sheridan)
But I can't stop thinking
about what it cost us.

01:22.042 --> 01:24.958
And how much work
is still ahead of us.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.792
[music continues]

01:31.875 --> 01:34.083
(Sheridan)
Then again, uh,
maybe the doc's right.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.583
Embrace the moment.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.000
In the end,
it's all we have.

01:39.792 --> 01:42.875
[music continues]

01:56.833 --> 01:58.500
(Sheridan)
Trouble will come
in its own time.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.250
It always does.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.583
But that's tomorrow.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.333
Give me today
and I will be happy.

02:15.542 --> 02:17.417
[swooshing]

02:21.292 --> 02:23.458
Hey, Al.
Thanks for stopping by.

02:23.542 --> 02:26.833
I just came back
from a meeting at Earth Dome.

02:26.917 --> 02:29.042
The president has commissioned
a new program

02:29.125 --> 02:31.250
involving Psi Corps..

02:31.333 --> 02:36.042
...Earthforce, Nightwatch
and the Ministry of Peace.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.542
Now, for reasons of security,
none of these groups

02:38.625 --> 02:41.500
will know what the others
have been assigned to.

02:41.583 --> 02:44.708
Won't we end up
stepping on each other's toes?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.500
That's a risk
we'll have to take.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.583
The president can't trust anyone
outside of the inner circle

02:52.667 --> 02:55.208
with the whole picture.

02:55.292 --> 02:57.750
I'm not authorized
to give you the details.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.833
But something has
rattled him big time.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.250
So, we've been given
a new mandate.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.625
The president wants
Babylon 5 shut down..

03:07.708 --> 03:09.167
...permanently.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.917
[theme music]

03:14.000 --> 03:15.917
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.792
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:17.875 --> 03:20.750
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.417
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.750
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.583
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.167
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.917
(Londo)
It was a new age.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.958
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

03:32.042 --> 03:34.792
(Susan)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:34.875 --> 03:37.292
[instrumental music]

03:37.375 --> 03:39.958
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

03:40.042 --> 03:41.083
The place..

03:41.167 --> 03:42.917
(Sheridan)
"Babylon 5."

03:43.000 --> 03:46.042
[theme music]

04:16.042 --> 04:19.083
[music continues]

04:42.333 --> 04:44.833
(Bester)
'If Clark wants to
shut down Babylon 5'

04:44.917 --> 04:46.708
why not just
send in the troops?

04:46.792 --> 04:50.083
They tried that last year
when they turned back our ships.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.875
It had a disastrous effect
on morale.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.375
There's considerable sympathy
for Babylon 5

04:55.458 --> 04:57.958
among the alien governments
and here at home.

04:58.042 --> 05:01.042
So those are the areas being
targeted in the new program.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.125
The goal is to knock
the pins out from under them

05:04.208 --> 05:07.000
then move in
when they're vulnerable.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.375
Any questions?

05:09.542 --> 05:10.708
No, sir.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.833
[instrumental music]

05:24.583 --> 05:29.000
Your ship is ready to leave
for Babylon 5, Prime Minister.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.625
You're sure you can't stay
with us a while longer?

05:31.708 --> 05:33.458
With the recent
passing of the emperor

05:33.542 --> 05:35.792
and the Narn Homeworld
being freed

05:35.875 --> 05:38.875
I don't think this is a safe
place for me just now, hmm?

05:38.958 --> 05:41.667
I will return
when things calm down.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.875
Well, it's our loss.

05:43.958 --> 05:47.083
The jarno plants are
just coming into bloom.

05:47.167 --> 05:50.375
Five days of flowering
and then they're gone.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.833
Just like life, I suppose.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.542
You really should see it!

05:54.625 --> 05:56.750
Well, next time.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.500
Oh.

05:58.583 --> 06:01.792
I should tell you,
the Centaurum met this morning

06:01.875 --> 06:04.042
to discuss
choosing a new emperor.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.500
With all the recent problems

06:05.583 --> 06:08.625
they voted to postpone
any decisions for a while

06:08.708 --> 06:11.750
so, they could choose
more wisely this time.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.333
Well, probably a good idea.

06:13.417 --> 06:16.875
The royal bloodline
isn't what it used to be.

06:16.958 --> 06:20.667
Too much intermarrying,
I suppose.

06:20.750 --> 06:25.458
I always say, "When you reduce
a family tree to a family bush

06:25.542 --> 06:27.667
you just can't hide
as much beneath it."

06:27.750 --> 06:29.750
[both chuckling]

06:29.833 --> 06:30.833
Exactly.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.292
So, the Centaurum has decided

06:33.375 --> 06:35.500
to appoint a regent
to the throne

06:35.583 --> 06:38.458
until a new emperor
can be selected.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.250
A regent?

06:40.333 --> 06:42.250
Oh, my heavens!

06:42.333 --> 06:44.458
Who would take that job?

06:44.542 --> 06:47.000
It pays very well, I hear.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.958
But it's simply
a ceremonial role.

06:50.042 --> 06:52.792
you.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.167
It hardly seems worth..

06:58.042 --> 06:59.208
Me?

06:59.292 --> 07:00.958
You.

07:01.042 --> 07:03.125
[chuckles]
Oh, dear.

07:04.958 --> 07:08.792
The royal court
awaits your orders, regent.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.542
If you need any advice,
I'll be on Babylon 5.

07:13.625 --> 07:14.792
Good day.

07:14.875 --> 07:17.042
Uh, w-well,
there is, there's a..

07:23.792 --> 07:25.542
I'm thinking..

07:31.333 --> 07:32.792
...pastels.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.208
Well, I don't see any sign
of infection. That's good.

07:42.292 --> 07:44.042
Wouldn't want to go any deeper
into your eye cavity

07:44.125 --> 07:45.542
to dig it out.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.708
Thank you. I believe
I've had quite enough of that.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.958
There's a lot of
scarring back here.

07:51.042 --> 07:52.667
Well, the Centauri
who plucked it out

07:52.750 --> 07:54.875
was not a surgeon
of your caliber.

07:54.958 --> 07:57.708
I believe he used
something similar to this.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.667
I only saw it
end on, you see.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.333
Yeah. Here.

08:03.417 --> 08:04.708
Is there any pain?

08:04.792 --> 08:06.083
There is pain.

08:06.167 --> 08:08.208
Sometimes I find my eye itches.

08:08.292 --> 08:10.750
How can it itch
if it's no longer there?

08:10.833 --> 08:12.542
Phantom limb syndrome.

08:12.625 --> 08:16.042
Nerves are still sending off
random impulses.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.042
Let me give you something
for the pain.

08:18.125 --> 08:20.458
Then I want you to come back
for a full neural scan

08:20.542 --> 08:23.750
to determine what's left
of the optic nerve bundle.

08:23.833 --> 08:26.875
I can't promise anything, but
I might be able to fix you up

08:26.958 --> 08:28.667
with a prosthetic.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.583
Yeah, it's gonna be
a tough match.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.583
I don't have the access
to the newer prosthetics

08:32.667 --> 08:34.500
now that we're
cut off from Earth.

08:34.583 --> 08:38.625
And they are designed
for human metabolism...but..

08:38.708 --> 08:42.375
Will I- will I see
as I did before?

08:42.458 --> 08:44.875
Well, even under
ideal conditions

08:44.958 --> 08:46.250
the neural interface
is difficult.

08:46.333 --> 08:47.875
You're gonna have
some scanning lines

08:47.958 --> 08:50.125
some interference, if you
get near power sources and--

08:50.208 --> 08:53.292
Oh. It will do.
Thank you, doctor.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.333
- Here.
- Thank you.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.375
G'Kar.

08:58.458 --> 09:01.667
There's a rumor that,
uh, after Narn was freed

09:01.750 --> 09:05.500
your people wanted to put you
in charge. Is that true?

09:05.583 --> 09:08.167
- Mm-hmm.
- Why didn't you take it?

09:08.250 --> 09:10.375
I have seen what power does.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.042
And I have seen
what power costs.

09:13.125 --> 09:16.208
The one is never
equal to the other.

09:16.292 --> 09:17.708
Ugh!

09:20.417 --> 09:23.500
[instrumental music]

09:47.167 --> 09:49.250
(male #1)
'What happened after you
left Babylon 5?'

09:49.333 --> 09:50.750
I told you, I don't remember!

09:50.833 --> 09:53.875
- 'What happened--'
- I said, I don't remember!

10:00.750 --> 10:03.750
[beeping]

10:07.000 --> 10:08.667
- Yeah, what is it?
- 'Mr. Garibaldi.'

10:08.750 --> 10:09.958
'We've got
a coded message for you.'

10:10.042 --> 10:11.667
- 'It just came in.'
- Source?

10:11.750 --> 10:13.375
'We haven't been able
to run it down.'

10:13.458 --> 10:16.167
'We ran a standard decode on it
but we couldn't find anything.'

10:16.250 --> 10:17.500
Alright, put it through.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.375
Computer, delete
last transmission

10:28.458 --> 10:30.542
and log of incoming messages.

10:45.917 --> 10:48.292
Well, we might
as well get started.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.292
I..

10:50.375 --> 10:53.708
Mr. Garibaldi, good of you
to join us at last.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.083
Well, now that
we are all here..

10:55.167 --> 10:56.667
Uh.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.500
Before you do that,
there's, uh..

10:58.583 --> 11:00.750
...something I wanna say.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.875
[scoffs]
This isn't easy for me
and I imagine it's gonna be

11:02.958 --> 11:06.208
a pain in the butt
for everybody else too, but..

11:06.292 --> 11:07.625
[sighing]

11:07.708 --> 11:09.750
Well, there's no easy way to get
to it, so I'll just say it.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.750
I've decided to resign
as Head of Security

11:11.833 --> 11:13.500
effective immediately.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.250
Uh, you can't just
resign like this.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.417
Who says? I mean, since
we broke away from Earth

11:20.500 --> 11:22.333
you can't exactly hold me
to my Earthforce contract.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.958
We're free agents now.

11:25.042 --> 11:28.125
Michael, we-we've all been under
a lot of strain lately, alright?

11:28.208 --> 11:30.292
So, no one can blame you for
feeling a little stressed out.

11:30.375 --> 11:33.750
- Maybe a few days away--
- I don't want a few days away.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.375
I don't want a vacation,
a leave of absence

11:35.458 --> 11:36.917
or a five-day pass
to Disney Planet.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.292
I just...want out!

11:38.375 --> 11:40.583
- Why?
- Why?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.000
Because I wanna get out of
the game while I'm still ahead.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.500
That's why.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.417
Where does it say that I have
to fight someone else's battles

11:45.500 --> 11:48.583
everyday for
the rest of my life?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.167
'I'm tired.'

11:50.250 --> 11:53.542
I'm tired of fighting wars I
can't even begin to understand.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.292
Okay, we won.
So, now what?

11:56.375 --> 11:57.958
We can't go home.

11:58.042 --> 12:00.583
President Clark would have us
up for treason in a hot second.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.333
'So, do we go up against
our ships again?'

12:02.417 --> 12:04.000
'Just stay out here,
live like outlaws'

12:04.083 --> 12:06.458
for the rest of our lives?
What kind of a life is that?

12:06.542 --> 12:09.292
I agree we have got a lot
of work to do back home.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.042
But there are ways to do it.

12:11.125 --> 12:12.625
And what if you're not
doing it the right way?

12:12.708 --> 12:14.667
If you got a better idea,
put it on the table.

12:14.750 --> 12:18.458
No, I don't have a better idea.
I can't find a way out of this.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.125
All I see here
is a chance to get out

12:20.208 --> 12:22.000
while I still have my skin.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.958
Make a life.

12:24.042 --> 12:25.667
Maybe find a little happiness.

12:25.750 --> 12:26.917
Uh, doing what?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.500
[sighs]
Uh..

12:29.583 --> 12:31.750
I figure, you know,
go independent.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.333
Start my own company.

12:33.417 --> 12:34.708
You know, during the war,
whole lot of people

12:34.792 --> 12:36.333
lost a whole lot of things..

12:36.417 --> 12:38.125
...and a whole lot of people.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.500
They're gonna need someone
to help them find those things.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.958
A man could make
a decent living doing that.

12:43.042 --> 12:45.667
- Hell, maybe even do some good.
- Garibaldi..

12:45.750 --> 12:49.000
Look, I didn't come here
to argue with you.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.250
I just wanted to tell you
because you got a right to know.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.625
We all went through
hell together

12:53.708 --> 12:55.750
and whether you realize
it or not..

12:55.833 --> 12:58.583
...we're all damn lucky
to be alive.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.833
I did my part, and now it's..

13:01.917 --> 13:05.167
It's time for me to try
and find a life for myself.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.875
'The war was about
finding our own way'

13:06.958 --> 13:09.042
and making our own choices.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.625
If you won't
let me do that, if..

13:11.708 --> 13:13.917
...if I can't carve out just
a little bit of happiness

13:14.000 --> 13:15.542
for myself..

13:15.625 --> 13:17.375
...then I have to ask..

13:17.458 --> 13:20.042
What the hell
were we fighting for?

13:26.625 --> 13:28.708
(Zack)
After you get your assignments,
you still have to rotate

13:28.792 --> 13:30.875
through customs once
every two or three days.

13:30.958 --> 13:32.958
We get a lot of ships
coming through here.

13:33.042 --> 13:35.375
And if we don't rotate
our people on a regular basis

13:35.458 --> 13:36.708
they'll get burned out.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.583
Now, check this display
as soon as you come on duty.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.000
This is where
you'll get your updates

13:41.083 --> 13:42.833
on who to hold and
who to let through.

13:42.917 --> 13:45.292
Anything unusual gets flagged.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.667
And would I fall under the
category of unusual, Mr. Allan?

13:48.750 --> 13:50.167
Well..

13:50.250 --> 13:52.792
Didn't think we'd be seeing you
again anytime soon, ambassador.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.375
Yes, I gathered that from
the look of unvarnished joy

13:56.458 --> 13:58.042
on your face
when you saw me.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.333
Perhaps, you'd
like to sit down

13:59.417 --> 14:01.417
before you are
overcome by ecstasy.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.917
Thanks, I'm fine.
So, what happened?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.292
They get tired
of you back home?

14:05.375 --> 14:08.208
Tired? No, of course, not.
Don't be absurd.

14:08.292 --> 14:12.125
Why, the emperor himself said
I would only be allowed to leave

14:12.208 --> 14:14.125
over his dead body.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.417
I said, "Well, how strange!

14:16.500 --> 14:20.250
"Mr. Allan said I would only
be allowed back onto Babylon 5

14:20.333 --> 14:21.875
over his dead body."

14:21.958 --> 14:23.750
With my very busy schedule

14:23.833 --> 14:26.125
I can only accommodate
so many requests.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.750
'I know it is a burden'

14:27.833 --> 14:31.167
but you will simply
have to wait your turn.

14:31.250 --> 14:34.292
[both laughing]

14:35.500 --> 14:37.708
The only reason that guy
is still alive is that

14:37.792 --> 14:40.667
half the time, I don't know what
the hell he's talking about.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.792
The other half,
I wish I didn't.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.875
Well, that's why it's important
to check in on customs

14:44.958 --> 14:46.208
on a regular basis.

14:46.292 --> 14:47.875
You never know who's
gonna walk in that..

14:47.958 --> 14:50.292
Just a guess, Mr. Allan,
but I'd suggest

14:50.375 --> 14:53.375
the word you're
looking for is "door."

14:53.458 --> 14:55.667
Now, please notify
the captain that I'm here.

14:55.750 --> 14:59.792
I need to meet with him and the
rest of the command staff ASAP.

14:59.875 --> 15:03.708
I assume my usual quarters
in the brig are available.

15:03.792 --> 15:06.042
I've grown so attached
to the place.

15:06.125 --> 15:09.292
For you, Mr. Bester, always.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.083
Well, you ever have
one of those days?

15:19.208 --> 15:20.875
Yeah, well,
I guess I better notify.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.250
[beeping]

15:22.333 --> 15:23.792
Zack here.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.792
(female #1)
'The captain wants
to see you ASAP.'

15:25.875 --> 15:27.792
'He said there's been
a problem with Mr. Garibaldi.'

15:27.875 --> 15:29.042
On my way.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.500
Look, I'm getting
the hell out of here

15:30.583 --> 15:32.083
before anybody else
walks through there.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.250
With my luck,
it'll be the Second Coming.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.417
And I'm still three commandments
behind on penance.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.917
Here, take over.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.083
[instrumental music]

15:43.583 --> 15:45.375
[machine beeping]

15:46.958 --> 15:48.042
Thank you.

15:55.917 --> 15:56.875
[doorbell chimes]

15:56.958 --> 15:58.458
Yeah, come in.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.417
G'Kar. Hi.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.292
I heard..

16:05.375 --> 16:08.583
Well, I-I heard
you went looking for me.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.542
You're about
the only one who did.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.208
I heard you lost your, uh..

16:13.292 --> 16:16.208
Uh, that the Centauri
captured you because of me.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.125
Well, i-i-if you had
stayed here on the station

16:18.208 --> 16:19.917
'where you had sanctuary,
then..'

16:20.000 --> 16:21.958
...they-they-they
couldn't have..

16:22.042 --> 16:24.417
G'Kar, I, uh, I'm sorry.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.042
I don't know what else to say.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.458
I'm sorry.

16:28.542 --> 16:32.375
- Uh!
- Welcome home, Mr. Garibaldi!

16:32.458 --> 16:34.250
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Thank you, G'Kar.

16:34.333 --> 16:35.958
- What?
- I can't breathe.

16:36.042 --> 16:37.958
[chuckles]
Oh! Ah!

16:39.625 --> 16:42.417
Sorry.
Why were you apologizing?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.500
Uh, because, uh..
Because it was all for nothing.

16:45.583 --> 16:46.917
I mean, you went through
all that for me

16:47.000 --> 16:49.125
and they found me
somewhere else.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.958
All for nothing?
Absolutely not.

16:52.042 --> 16:54.958
Yes, true, if I hadn't gone
after you, the Centauri would

16:55.042 --> 16:57.500
never have captured me,
and, yes, it cost me my eye.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.625
But it put me in the right place
to strike a deal with Mollari.

17:01.708 --> 17:05.083
Because of that deal,
my world is now free.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.292
- Well, then you're not upset?
- Upset?

17:07.375 --> 17:09.375
I'm delirious with joy!

17:09.458 --> 17:11.542
It proves that
if you confront the universe

17:11.625 --> 17:13.750
with good intentions
in your heart

17:13.833 --> 17:16.917
it will reflect that
and reward your intent.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.458
- Yeah.
- Usually.

17:18.542 --> 17:21.958
It just doesn't always do it
in the way you expect.

17:22.042 --> 17:25.792
Yeah, maybe, maybe.
Maybe so. I'm just, uh..

17:25.875 --> 17:28.125
I'm just sorry you had
to go through all this.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.125
For this goal,
I'd go through far worse.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.750
That's why I came here,
to thank you.

17:33.833 --> 17:35.792
Through your friendship,
you became the one thing

17:35.875 --> 17:39.458
outside my own people that
I could care enough about

17:39.542 --> 17:41.667
to risk being captured..

17:41.750 --> 17:44.792
...and in so doing,
helped me serve my people..

17:44.875 --> 17:48.500
...more than I had
dreamed possible.

17:48.583 --> 17:51.625
You have a very weird way of
looking at the universe, G'Kar.

17:51.708 --> 17:54.292
But I kind of like it.
Thank you. Heh-heh.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.500
And you, Mr. Garibaldi.
Good day.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.125
[chuckling]

18:03.208 --> 18:06.250
Even for a Narn, he's nuts.

18:06.333 --> 18:10.250
I didn't think the chief would
ever walk away from this job.

18:10.333 --> 18:11.833
Something must gotta be wrong.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.667
He's been acting funny
ever since he got back.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.333
Maybe so,
but until we know more

18:16.417 --> 18:17.792
we have to go
along with this.

18:17.875 --> 18:20.750
Yeah, meanwhile, I'm putting
you in charge of security.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.833
After that, I want you
to find Lyta Alexander

18:22.917 --> 18:24.500
and escort her to
the conference room.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.292
We're meeting with Bester
in about an hour

18:26.375 --> 18:28.167
and I wanna be sure
we're not scanned.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.417
Ivanova. Go.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.667
(female #2)
'Commander, you better
put on ISN.'

18:32.750 --> 18:34.500
'They're talking about us.'

18:39.542 --> 18:41.625
Computer, show us ISN.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.875
The new issued presidential
mandate forbids any Earth ship

18:47.000 --> 18:49.458
to travel to or from Babylon 5.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.042
'This includes commercial
transport, passenger liners'

18:52.125 --> 18:53.875
'and private cruisers.'

18:53.958 --> 18:56.250
'Earthforce patrols
are authorized to use force'

18:56.333 --> 18:58.208
'to maintain
the quarantine zone.'

18:58.292 --> 19:01.375
Any ship found violating
these rules will be seized

19:01.458 --> 19:04.833
with both crews and passengers
subject to arrest.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.542
'The president took this action
in response to reports'

19:07.625 --> 19:09.542
'from the Ministries
of Peace and Security'

19:09.625 --> 19:11.375
detailing possible
terrorist threats

19:11.458 --> 19:13.375
emanating from Babylon 5.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.208
The president will
release information

19:15.292 --> 19:17.583
regarding these threats
at a later date.

19:17.667 --> 19:21.125
Once again, all travel
between Earth and Babylon 5

19:21.208 --> 19:23.292
'is now forbidden by law.'

19:28.167 --> 19:29.083
[chimes]

19:29.167 --> 19:30.958
- 'Yes?'
- Zack Allan, ma'am.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.792
Can I see you?

19:36.333 --> 19:38.542
- You moving?
- Oh.

19:38.625 --> 19:41.208
Uh, while I working for him,
the new Vorlon ambassador

19:41.292 --> 19:43.167
had me throw everything out.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.583
'He said it was a distraction
from my duties.'

19:45.667 --> 19:48.000
Now that he's gone,
I went out

19:48.083 --> 19:49.458
picked up a few things

19:49.542 --> 19:52.083
and...I don't quite know
where to put it all.

19:52.167 --> 19:53.792
'Yeah, I know the feeling.'

19:53.875 --> 19:56.000
Listen, the captain wants me
to escort you

19:56.083 --> 19:57.292
to the conference room.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.708
Bester just came aboard, and..

19:58.792 --> 20:00.917
Bester?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.583
- The Psi Corp?
- 'Yeah.'

20:02.667 --> 20:05.125
Uh, sorry, I assumed
the two of you had met before.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.750
Oh, we have.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.958
While I was at the academy,
I interned with the Psi Corps

20:09.042 --> 20:11.125
as a field assistant.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.667
Psi Corps are trained
to make everyone nervous

20:12.750 --> 20:15.458
but Bester can make even
other Psi Corps nervous.

20:15.542 --> 20:18.875
Hell, the guy can make
Poison Ivy nervous, heh.

20:18.958 --> 20:21.792
'But we have to make sure
he doesn't scan anybody.'

20:21.875 --> 20:23.875
Captain needs you
to keep an eye on him.

20:23.958 --> 20:25.292
Zack..

20:25.375 --> 20:28.542
...when I broke with the Corps,
I became a rogue telepath.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.250
As far as Bester's concerned,
I'm just another blip.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.208
If he sees me,
he'll take me back.

20:33.292 --> 20:36.167
The Captain won't let him
take you anywhere.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.292
You've got
his personal guarantee.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.958
So, will you come?

20:41.042 --> 20:42.042
Okay.

20:42.125 --> 20:43.625
Zack, uh..

20:43.708 --> 20:45.417
...how come the only time
people come to see me

20:45.500 --> 20:47.375
is when they want
something from me?

20:47.458 --> 20:48.792
Scan someone.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.083
Protect someone.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.333
Set up the Vorlon
so you can take him out.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.250
I nearly got
my brain fried at Z'Ha'Dum

20:54.333 --> 20:56.208
but nobody comes
just to visit.

20:56.292 --> 20:59.333
Nobody comes by and says,
"Let's have dinner."

20:59.417 --> 21:00.958
Well, I'm sure
it's nothing personal.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.875
I don't have to be a teep
to know that you're lying, Zack.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.292
So, what is it?

21:06.375 --> 21:08.167
Look, Lyta,
you gotta understand..

21:08.250 --> 21:09.667
...you were close to the Vorlons

21:09.750 --> 21:13.667
and they're not exactly
popular right now.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.583
And...there's a rumor going
around that before they left

21:16.667 --> 21:18.833
they changed you,
made some modifications.

21:18.917 --> 21:22.500
'So, yeah, people are
a little wary around you.'

21:22.583 --> 21:23.833
With everything
we've been through lately

21:23.917 --> 21:25.917
can you blame them?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.667
No, I can't.

21:28.667 --> 21:29.792
I guess I already knew it.

21:29.875 --> 21:32.333
I just needed
to hear it from someone.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.167
I needed someone to be
honest with me about it.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.083
Thanks.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.500
'I might not like it, but
at least, I know where I stand.'

21:41.583 --> 21:43.875
Well, just part of the service.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.875
L-listen, um..

21:47.958 --> 21:51.833
...later on, if you still need
some help unpacking this stuff..

21:51.917 --> 21:53.875
...you call me, okay?

21:53.958 --> 21:55.792
I'll bring pizza.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.458
Thanks.

21:58.542 --> 21:59.542
Yeah.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.958
[laughing]

22:02.042 --> 22:03.375
Too much!

22:03.458 --> 22:04.833
You're a thief!

22:04.917 --> 22:08.042
I'll give you 20 credits
for the set. That's all.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.708
So?

22:09.792 --> 22:12.583
[laughing]

22:14.542 --> 22:17.625
[intense music]

22:22.333 --> 22:25.417
[indistinct chatter]

22:37.833 --> 22:41.292
My world is now free.

22:41.375 --> 22:45.833
You no longer exist
in my universe.

22:45.917 --> 22:49.750
Pray that we never notice
one another again.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.708
I want you to know
that I object to this, captain.

22:59.792 --> 23:02.458
Miss Alexander has
no business being here.

23:02.542 --> 23:03.625
She's a blip.

23:03.708 --> 23:04.917
By all rights,
I should arrest her

23:05.000 --> 23:06.167
and take her back with me.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.875
Oh, you could do that.

23:07.958 --> 23:10.625
And I could nail your head
to the table, set fire to it

23:10.708 --> 23:14.125
and feed your charred remains
to the Pak'ma'ra.

23:14.208 --> 23:15.833
But it's an imperfect world

23:15.917 --> 23:18.250
and we never get exactly
what we want.

23:18.333 --> 23:21.958
- So get used to it.
- Captain, this is pointless.

23:22.042 --> 23:23.708
She's a P5.

23:23.792 --> 23:25.542
If I were really
going to try something

23:25.625 --> 23:28.708
she's not strong enough
to block me anyway.

23:28.792 --> 23:32.250
You're just embarrassing
yourself and her.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.792
Haven't we learned by now
to trust each other?

23:34.875 --> 23:37.250
No. Now, sit.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.875
I take it you've seen the news.

23:44.958 --> 23:46.208
We have.

23:46.292 --> 23:48.167
What the hell is
going on back home?

23:48.250 --> 23:49.958
This quarantine?

23:50.042 --> 23:52.000
Now that he's lost his allies
among the Shadows

23:52.083 --> 23:54.667
the president is worried
about what you might do next.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.958
He knows you'll come after him
sooner or later

23:57.042 --> 23:59.500
so he's making
a preemptive strike.

23:59.583 --> 24:02.583
He wants to destroy
your credibility..

24:02.667 --> 24:04.708
...undermine your position
back home

24:04.792 --> 24:07.042
and among the alien governments.

24:07.125 --> 24:10.667
They've already launched
phase one, the propaganda war.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.417
With phase two,
they get serious.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.875
- And what's phase two?
- Ah!

24:17.958 --> 24:20.500
It's not that easy, Mr. Allan.

24:20.583 --> 24:23.417
This information
has a price tag attached to it.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.542
Why, you said that you would
help us in exchange for us

24:25.625 --> 24:27.208
trying to free your lover
from the neural nets

24:27.292 --> 24:28.667
the Shadows used on her.

24:28.750 --> 24:32.417
True, even though
the Shadows seem to be gone

24:32.500 --> 24:34.125
their allies in
the Corps are still there

24:34.208 --> 24:37.125
so I can't pursue this
back home.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.375
But, uh..

24:39.458 --> 24:42.542
...you haven't
succeeded yet, have you?

24:42.625 --> 24:45.208
The organic technology used in
the wetware is beyond anything

24:45.292 --> 24:47.250
we've ever come across before.

24:47.333 --> 24:48.917
I've put them back
into cryogenic suspension

24:49.000 --> 24:50.250
until we can figure it out.

24:50.333 --> 24:53.583
- Now, in time, we--
- There is another way.

24:53.667 --> 24:56.708
If the Shadows
have left Z'Ha'Dum..

24:56.792 --> 24:59.583
...and that's where
this technology came from..

24:59.667 --> 25:01.417
...why not go there and take it?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.750
Go back to Z'Ha'Dum..
Are you nuts?

25:03.833 --> 25:06.792
Why not? If what you say is
true, the place is deserted.

25:06.875 --> 25:09.750
No. No, they would have
left defenses.

25:09.833 --> 25:11.083
Maybe so.

25:11.167 --> 25:13.333
But that's my price.

25:13.417 --> 25:14.667
You take me to Z'Ha'Dum

25:14.750 --> 25:17.583
and I'll tell you what
I know about phase two.

25:17.667 --> 25:20.708
After that,
we go our separate ways.

25:20.792 --> 25:23.042
It's a risk, I mean, even though
Z'Ha'Dum's been abandoned

25:23.125 --> 25:26.083
we don't know
what they left behind.

25:26.167 --> 25:30.083
'We're gonna have to have more
information before we try this.'

25:30.167 --> 25:32.000
(Franklin)
'Information or not, I don't
think you should go back'

25:32.083 --> 25:33.292
'there again.'

25:33.375 --> 25:35.875
You barely got out
the last time.

25:35.958 --> 25:38.375
(Zack)
'Look, we can send
someone else, right?'

25:38.458 --> 25:40.250
(Sheridan)
'No one else knows the area.'

25:41.000 --> 25:43.875
[intense music]

25:45.542 --> 25:47.417
You okay?

25:47.500 --> 25:48.708
Fine.

25:52.625 --> 25:55.792
- Is there a consensus?
- No.

25:55.875 --> 25:58.125
But we'll go anyway.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.125
You have my word.

26:01.208 --> 26:03.000
Now, uh..

26:03.083 --> 26:05.625
...this phase two?

26:05.708 --> 26:10.125
President Clark has ordered
the Earthforce base in Sector 49

26:10.208 --> 26:13.208
to keep a squadron
of Starfuries on patrol

26:13.292 --> 26:15.708
beside the local jumpgate.

26:15.792 --> 26:18.292
Sector 49 is
the last stopover point

26:18.375 --> 26:21.625
for ships traveling
from Earth to Babylon 5.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.333
They've been told
to challenge any ship

26:23.417 --> 26:25.458
coming through the gate.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.208
What they don't know is
that a Black Omega squadron

26:28.292 --> 26:30.458
an elite attack force
attached to Psi Corps

26:30.542 --> 26:32.792
and answerable only
to President Clark

26:32.875 --> 26:35.833
has been dispatched
in heavily armed transports.

26:35.917 --> 26:38.958
Their mission is to jump out
and destroy the security patrol

26:39.042 --> 26:40.667
before they can react.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.375
Then leave behind evidence
indicating that Babylon 5

26:43.458 --> 26:46.167
was responsible
for the attack.

26:46.250 --> 26:49.250
Blaming you for the unprovoked
murder of our pilots..

26:49.333 --> 26:51.167
...will help get the military
and public opinion

26:51.250 --> 26:53.083
back on Clark's side.

26:53.167 --> 26:55.292
You'll have to send a team
to intercept the Black Omega

26:55.375 --> 26:58.333
squadron immediately
or it'll be too late.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.333
[scoffs]
It's ironic, I suppose.

27:00.417 --> 27:01.958
Save the Earthforce patrol

27:02.042 --> 27:05.000
and continue
the blockade of Babylon 5.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.333
Let them be destroyed

27:06.417 --> 27:07.625
and you'll be framed
for murder

27:07.708 --> 27:10.000
and lose sympathy back home.

27:10.083 --> 27:13.417
For you, it's a lose-lose
proposition, captain.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.375
But as you said..

27:15.458 --> 27:17.417
...it's an imperfect world.

27:20.042 --> 27:21.417
I appreciate you're
doing this, chief.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.875
(Garibaldi)
'Not a problem.'

27:22.958 --> 27:24.583
You know when I got
the emergency codes

27:24.667 --> 27:27.875
to lock down the station, I made
sure to put them someplace safe.

27:27.958 --> 27:30.250
So, why is it that someplace
safe is always the one place

27:30.333 --> 27:32.208
you can never remember later?

27:34.625 --> 27:36.750
You got something
to say, Zack?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.167
I got eyes in
the back of my head.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.583
You grow 'em after you've
been shot in the back.

27:42.667 --> 27:45.417
You run security long enough.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.750
You're gonna grow
'em yourself.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.792
So?

27:49.875 --> 27:52.250
I think
you're making a mistake.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.958
Quitting like this, chief,
it just ain't right.

27:55.042 --> 27:57.625
Not after everything
we've been through.

27:57.708 --> 27:59.500
What, you don't
want a promotion?

27:59.583 --> 28:01.917
[sighs]
It's not about a promotion.
You know better than that.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.542
I just don't want you
to make a mistake.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.083
Here we go.

28:09.167 --> 28:11.000
Found it.

28:11.083 --> 28:12.667
[sighs]
Zack..

28:12.750 --> 28:14.583
...I got a flash for you.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.250
You know, the one thing in life
that you can be sure about

28:16.333 --> 28:18.500
is that you're gonna
make mistakes.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.750
Big ones, small ones.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.750
And the kind of mistakes
that take your breath away

28:22.833 --> 28:25.833
and...haunt you for
the rest of your life.

28:25.917 --> 28:27.208
It happens.

28:27.292 --> 28:29.750
I've had to learn
that the hard way.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.125
But this, right or wrong..

28:32.208 --> 28:34.333
...this is something that
I gotta do for myself.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.125
Remember when I hired you?

28:38.208 --> 28:41.333
Yeah. It was the first break
I had in a long time.

28:41.417 --> 28:43.417
Exactly. Details
I don't have to go into.

28:43.500 --> 28:47.500
You know and I know, and that's
all that needs know, right?

28:47.583 --> 28:50.458
Nobody would hire you.
I checked your references.

28:50.542 --> 28:53.083
They all said,
"The guy is a problem."

28:53.167 --> 28:56.458
But at some point,
you just gotta go on instinct.

28:56.542 --> 28:59.500
The way I figure it, we are
all entitled to one really big

28:59.583 --> 29:02.625
incredibly stupid screw-up
in our lives.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.542
Maybe this is one of those.

29:04.625 --> 29:06.583
We'll see.

29:06.667 --> 29:09.500
A lot of people told me
I was making a mistake with you.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.042
But I was right.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.917
And if I could be
right about you..

29:15.000 --> 29:17.958
...why can't I be
right about me?

29:18.042 --> 29:20.583
Zack, you're the best second
I've ever had.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.208
You'll make a good chief.

29:22.292 --> 29:23.708
Well, not as good as me,
but, you know, we can't expect

29:23.792 --> 29:25.083
miracles here, right?

29:25.167 --> 29:26.292
[chuckles]
Geez!

29:26.375 --> 29:29.750
Talk about
delusions of adequacy.

29:29.833 --> 29:33.375
- Here.
- Thanks.

29:33.458 --> 29:36.750
- For everything.
- You are welcome.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.250
Now, get out of here.
I got things to do.

29:47.417 --> 29:49.167
[sighs]

30:09.167 --> 30:10.583
Hey.

30:12.875 --> 30:14.167
Ah.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.250
Thank you for coming along.

30:16.333 --> 30:17.917
You know, spending
five minutes with Bester

30:18.000 --> 30:19.458
would try the patience
of a saint

30:19.542 --> 30:21.958
but being stuck
with him on a ship

30:22.042 --> 30:23.583
goes above and beyond
the call of duty.

30:23.667 --> 30:26.250
It's not a burden. It will
give us some time together.

30:26.333 --> 30:30.083
- That can never be a bad thing.
- I know, I know.

30:30.167 --> 30:31.917
It's just we never
seem to get a break.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.167
You know, I figured..

30:33.250 --> 30:35.375
...well, the war's over, we won

30:35.458 --> 30:39.333
we should get a few days off
before the next big crisis.

30:39.417 --> 30:41.542
But it never seems
to work out that way.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.083
No.

30:43.167 --> 30:46.458
And you wouldn't have
it any other way.

30:46.542 --> 30:50.250
- I beg your pardon.
- You're a problem solver, hmm.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.167
You're one of these people
who will pick up a rope

30:52.250 --> 30:54.833
that's gotten all tangled up
and spend an entire day

30:54.917 --> 30:56.542
untangling it.

30:56.625 --> 31:00.333
Because it's a challenge,
because it defies your..

31:00.417 --> 31:02.375
...sense of order
in the universe

31:02.458 --> 31:04.750
and because you can.

31:04.833 --> 31:08.083
Sometimes I try to picture you
sitting on a beach

31:08.167 --> 31:10.292
with absolutely nothing to do.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.458
And?

31:11.542 --> 31:13.250
And the picture always ends

31:13.333 --> 31:15.417
with your head imploding.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.667
Oh, you haven't known me
this long to know me so well.

31:19.750 --> 31:21.792
- We're old souls.
- Heh.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.917
Deal with it.

31:30.208 --> 31:32.292
Earth security patrol
to transports.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.708
If you're en route to Babylon 5

31:33.792 --> 31:35.917
you must turn back or
prepare to be boarded.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.375
Do you receive?

31:40.208 --> 31:42.958
I repeat, security patrol
to unidentified ships!

31:43.042 --> 31:45.125
Heave to at once!

31:49.542 --> 31:52.000
(Ivanova)
'Alpha Squadron to Earthforce
Patrol. It's a trap!'

31:52.083 --> 31:54.208
'Break off! Break off!'

31:56.917 --> 32:00.000
[dramatic music]

32:01.958 --> 32:03.417
We've got 'em boxed in.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.083
Alphas two and three, help take
out the enemy fighters!

32:05.167 --> 32:06.958
Four and Five, you're with me!

32:07.042 --> 32:10.083
[music continues]

32:17.333 --> 32:19.333
Security Patrol
to Alpha Squadron.

32:19.417 --> 32:21.042
Damn, people, you just
saved our butts.

32:21.125 --> 32:22.625
Where the hell
did you come from?

32:22.708 --> 32:25.625
- 'Babylon 5.'
- Babylon 5?

32:25.708 --> 32:28.000
I thought you were supposed
to be the bad guys here.

32:28.083 --> 32:30.167
Well, let's just say that
reports of our disloyalty

32:30.250 --> 32:32.542
have been greatly exaggerated.

32:32.625 --> 32:33.833
[beeping]

32:33.917 --> 32:36.500
We hit their primaries.
Break away.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.333
[explosion]

32:52.833 --> 32:55.875
You've been keeping me out
since I got here.

32:55.958 --> 32:58.375
A good question is, why?

32:58.458 --> 33:00.958
A better question is..

33:01.042 --> 33:02.250
...how?

33:02.958 --> 33:04.292
I was thinking

33:04.375 --> 33:06.833
I may have spoken
rashly before.

33:06.917 --> 33:10.667
There may be some value
in not turning you over.

33:10.750 --> 33:13.708
You're stronger than
the last time I saw you.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.250
We all change.

33:15.333 --> 33:18.125
Yes, but, uh,
this is different.

33:18.208 --> 33:19.583
I can feel it.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.708
Whatever has happened to you..

33:22.792 --> 33:24.708
...you have a moral obligation
to share it

33:24.792 --> 33:27.250
with the Corps, Lyta.

33:27.333 --> 33:30.750
"The Corps is mother.
The Corps is father."

33:30.833 --> 33:33.583
In that case, Mr. Bester,
I'm an orphan.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.917
[scoffs]
Not an orphan.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.167
Just a confused, frightened
child who's run away..

33:41.250 --> 33:44.250
...and needs to be reminded
where home is.

33:47.125 --> 33:50.083
Lyta...remember

33:50.167 --> 33:52.250
I know things about you..

33:52.333 --> 33:55.208
...you wouldn't want
anyone else to know.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.417
'Never forget that.'

34:07.542 --> 34:08.958
Is that it?

34:09.042 --> 34:11.125
It looks like hell.

34:12.042 --> 34:13.917
That's about right.

34:16.833 --> 34:19.458
John, the crew is picking up
something unusual

34:19.542 --> 34:20.625
at the local jumpgate.

34:20.708 --> 34:21.958
What is it?

34:22.042 --> 34:24.208
It appears
to be an evacuation.

34:27.625 --> 34:30.667
[dramatic music]

34:34.083 --> 34:36.792
Those aren't Shadow vessels.
Who are they?

34:36.875 --> 34:39.042
Shadows couldn't have
done all they did alone.

34:39.125 --> 34:42.750
They had allies, dark servants
from other races who helped

34:42.833 --> 34:44.125
because they believed

34:44.208 --> 34:46.000
or because they had
something to gain.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.667
Why would they be evacuating?

34:47.750 --> 34:49.917
Are we picking up
any signals from the planet?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.083
- No.
- Lyta?

34:52.167 --> 34:55.375
I'm not sensing anything.
It feels...dead.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.917
Then we can go in.
There's no one there to stop us.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.417
- Come about!
- What?

34:59.500 --> 35:01.750
Get us away
from the planet, fast!

35:06.583 --> 35:07.792
What are you doing?

35:07.875 --> 35:10.000
Defenses down,
no warning message.

35:10.083 --> 35:12.167
There's nobody left down there!

35:12.250 --> 35:14.208
Maybe the Shadows decided
not to leave anything behind

35:14.292 --> 35:15.583
for others to steal.

35:15.667 --> 35:18.208
No. No! They wouldn't..

35:25.875 --> 35:27.750
[explosion]

35:31.792 --> 35:33.333
Well, looks like we're
still stuck with each other

35:33.417 --> 35:34.917
Mr. Bester.

35:35.625 --> 35:37.667
Like I said..

35:37.750 --> 35:39.583
...it's an imperfect world.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.708
[whirring]

35:48.792 --> 35:50.625
This is where we're keeping
most of the telepaths

35:50.708 --> 35:52.042
who we rescued
from the Shadows

35:52.125 --> 35:53.875
until the doc can get
the control devices

35:53.958 --> 35:55.542
out of their brains.

35:55.625 --> 35:58.167
The rest of them
are in cryo.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.292
Which one is she in?

36:01.458 --> 36:03.708
Your ship leaves
in ten minutes.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.708
I'll be back in five.

36:14.792 --> 36:16.083
Hi.

36:17.542 --> 36:18.750
I tried.

36:19.625 --> 36:22.625
Damn, but I tried.

36:22.708 --> 36:23.875
Six men.

36:24.833 --> 36:26.708
My best pilots.

36:28.167 --> 36:30.750
They weren't my orders.
I just passed them on.

36:30.833 --> 36:34.542
And...took advantage of it.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.375
They trusted me.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.917
Never imagined..

36:41.000 --> 36:43.208
...what I was sending them into.

36:47.083 --> 36:50.333
When I gave them the orders,
I looked in their eyes and..

36:54.875 --> 36:56.167
It's..

36:57.042 --> 36:59.125
...a hard thing..

36:59.208 --> 37:01.500
...to send people in to die..

37:03.792 --> 37:06.208
...when you're the one
pulling the trigger.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.625
But I'd do it again.

37:12.208 --> 37:14.583
Black Omega was my baby.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.875
My creation.

37:16.958 --> 37:21.583
And I'd gladly sacrifice
the whole squadron..

37:21.667 --> 37:24.042
...if it would bring
you back to me.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.083
But..

37:29.250 --> 37:30.958
...it was all for nothing.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.542
Sheridan and the others..

37:34.625 --> 37:36.625
...they're probably
laughing right now.

37:36.708 --> 37:39.625
Well, that's alright.

37:41.417 --> 37:43.750
I still have an ace in the hole.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.833
And it'll hurt them
more than anything

37:46.917 --> 37:48.958
they've ever done to me.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.583
I..

37:56.208 --> 37:57.708
...miss you.

37:59.792 --> 38:01.500
There's no one..

38:01.583 --> 38:04.708
...at home for me to talk to.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.833
Goodnight.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.125
I'll see you soon.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.667
I promise.

38:25.292 --> 38:26.375
[doorbell chimes]

38:26.458 --> 38:27.500
Yes?

38:33.083 --> 38:36.583
I just, uh, thought I'd come by,
see how you were doing.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.708
Fine. Fine.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.042
Why shouldn't I be?

38:41.125 --> 38:43.542
You know, I was just thinking
about the timing

38:43.625 --> 38:46.542
of that evacuation at Z'Ha'Dum.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.208
And then I remembered
what Ivanova told me..

38:49.292 --> 38:52.833
...that when the three of you
went to Z'Ha'Dum to find me..

38:52.917 --> 38:55.750
...the Shadows picked up
on your telepathic signal.

38:57.167 --> 38:59.542
Now, those sensors were
probably left behind

38:59.625 --> 39:02.292
when the Shadows went away.

39:02.375 --> 39:05.542
If someone who knew
they were there..

39:05.625 --> 39:08.083
'...began sending
a telepathic probe'

39:08.167 --> 39:10.917
the moment we hit hyperspace..

39:11.000 --> 39:14.708
...it might just be enough to
set off the destruct sequence.

39:16.625 --> 39:19.500
Of course, it would take
a very powerful telepath

39:19.583 --> 39:21.417
to send a signal that far ahead.

39:21.500 --> 39:24.167
Hyperspace has been known
to enhance telepathic abilities.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.125
Not that much.

39:26.208 --> 39:29.750
And do all that and keep Bester
from picking up the signal?

39:29.833 --> 39:33.250
That's a bit much for a P5,
wouldn't you say?

39:33.333 --> 39:36.708
'Maybe even beyond
a P10 or a P12.'

39:38.333 --> 39:40.917
Now, what I haven't
figured out yet..

39:41.000 --> 39:44.583
...is why would someone
go through all that?

39:46.250 --> 39:48.000
Theoretically..

39:49.917 --> 39:52.333
...maybe because
he got me angry.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.667
Maybe because there's
some leftover commands

39:55.750 --> 39:59.125
from the Vorlons
I haven't recognized yet.

39:59.208 --> 40:01.458
Maybe because what's left on
Z'Ha'Dum can't be allowed

40:01.542 --> 40:04.250
to fall into anyone's hands
for any reason.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.958
And maybe..

40:08.042 --> 40:10.375
...maybe because he has hurt
so many of my people

40:10.458 --> 40:13.625
he deserves to be hurt
in response.

40:13.708 --> 40:15.542
He has sent away
so many loved ones

40:15.625 --> 40:17.750
he deserves to find out what
it feels like to lose someone

40:17.833 --> 40:19.375
he cares about.

40:19.458 --> 40:24.417
And I wouldn't have been told
because he could scan me.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.458
But not you.

40:28.583 --> 40:29.708
Yes.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.917
Well, theoretically.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.042
Well, I'm glad we're
talking theory here, Lyta.

40:37.625 --> 40:41.167
Because as much as I may
agree with your reasons

40:41.250 --> 40:42.917
might even have
supported the decision

40:43.000 --> 40:45.333
if this were to happen again..

40:45.417 --> 40:48.667
...if a command-level decision
were made without consulting me

40:48.750 --> 40:50.833
I would turn you
over to the Psi Corps

40:50.917 --> 40:54.042
and let them
turn you inside out.

40:54.125 --> 40:57.833
Am I perfectly, crystal clear?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.167
Yes, sir.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.208
[doorbell chiming]

41:16.292 --> 41:18.375
Yes? What?

41:21.125 --> 41:23.708
I got half-plain-cheese
and half-pepperoni.

41:23.792 --> 41:25.542
'At least,
they said it was pepperoni.'

41:25.625 --> 41:28.417
I don't think we should
look too close, though.

41:29.417 --> 41:31.000
Still need a hand?

41:35.500 --> 41:37.500
I've been monitoring
the Gold Channels.

41:37.583 --> 41:41.000
Clark's having a hell of a time
explaining the ambush.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.875
"Just all a terrible mistake,"
he says.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.500
- Hmm.
- He won't try that again.

41:45.583 --> 41:47.083
No one would fall for it now.

41:47.167 --> 41:49.958
We've gone from
lose-lose to win-win.

41:50.042 --> 41:51.583
It seems like.

41:52.583 --> 41:54.167
So, why do you look so worried?

41:54.250 --> 41:57.125
I was just thinking about those
ships we saw leaving Z'Ha'Dum.

41:57.208 --> 42:02.375
Delenn called them the allies
of the Shadows, dark servants.

42:02.458 --> 42:04.208
We don't know what they took
when they left

42:04.292 --> 42:05.583
where they're going,
or what they plan to do

42:05.667 --> 42:07.083
when they get there.

42:07.167 --> 42:08.625
Maybe they just wanted out.

42:08.708 --> 42:10.542
Or maybe they want to get even.

42:10.625 --> 42:13.583
Well, with Z'Ha'Dum gone,
I mean, it'll take a long time

42:13.667 --> 42:15.417
before they can do
anything to anybody.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.542
Yeah, I suppose so.

42:17.625 --> 42:20.875
But I just wish I knew
where they were going.

42:22.625 --> 42:25.458
[instrumental music]

42:25.542 --> 42:27.292

42:31.042 --> 42:33.542

A dream!

42:35.083 --> 42:37.417
[chuckling]
That's all.

42:38.958 --> 42:42.000
Just a bad dream.

42:44.292 --> 42:46.333
