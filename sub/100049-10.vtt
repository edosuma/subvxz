00:01.540 --> 00:05.120
Previously on "How to Get Away
With Murder"...
She faked her death
and framed Snow White.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.250
Mr. Millstone,
come and get your check.

00:07.250 --> 00:09.250
An unknown source
has come forward,

00:09.250 --> 00:12.920
causing the FBI to open
several closed murder cases.

00:12.920 --> 00:13.960
I take it
you saw the news.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.620
Laurel?

00:15.620 --> 00:16.750
Y-You're in
witness protection?
No.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.580
Someone had to help you
do all this.

00:17.580 --> 00:18.830
It was Tegan.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.500
Asher, is it you?

00:20.500 --> 00:21.960
Yeah.
Let me explain.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.420
No, you chose yourself.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.080
They want Annalise! Okay?
They know everything.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.330
When you go down, I hope
I'm there to see it.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.040
Man: VIP Results.
Annalise: I'm ready.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.210
Man:
You're clear for takeoff.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.670
Agent Lim: Connor Walsh
and Michaela Pratt?

00:31.670 --> 00:33.080
You're both under arrest
for murder.
What?

00:33.080 --> 00:35.040
Stop.
What are you talking about?
Who died?

00:35.040 --> 00:37.000
Minister:
We ask you, o Lord,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.380
to lift up Annalise
and give her peace.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.920
Female officer:
Turn to the left.

01:14.620 --> 01:15.880
Now what?

01:15.880 --> 01:18.000
Body inspection.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.620

01:26.000 --> 01:30.170

01:39.500 --> 01:42.380
Male officer: Remove all
jewelry, your wedding ring.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.330
Female officer:
Open your mouth.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.460
We have security cameras
in every room at our house.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.250
The footage will prove
we didn't do this.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.460
Oliver:
This is the Castillos.

02:02.460 --> 02:03.790
They must have
hacked into the app

02:03.790 --> 02:05.250
and deleted the footage.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.250
Okay.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.540
They own
a telecom company.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.710
They do things like this.

02:08.710 --> 02:10.460
I think you need
some sleep.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.420
No, you have
my innocent husband locked up.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.210
I'm not sleeping
until you release him.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.420
Calm down.
No, please.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.580
Just believe me.

02:17.580 --> 02:20.380
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.710
Your fingerprints match those
on the murder weapon.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.750
No more running.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.920
It's all over.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.580
Michaela:
I want my lawyer.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.920
Celestine just texted

04:03.920 --> 04:06.880
that she never showed up
in Memphis.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.750
She left.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.790
Or Xavier's guys staged it
to make it look like she ran --

04:10.790 --> 04:12.670
just like Laurel.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.540
Or she left.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.040
Annalise?

04:21.040 --> 04:22.040
No.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.500
Hey.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.420
Where's Annalise?

04:26.420 --> 04:28.460
Her phone keeps going
straight to voicemail.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.210
She's probably
at graduation.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.210
Why aren't you?

04:31.210 --> 04:32.830
You haven't heard?

04:32.830 --> 04:34.080
Heard what?

04:36.540 --> 04:37.330
Asher's dead.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.500
The FBI says it's murder.

04:40.500 --> 04:41.620
Where are you?

04:41.620 --> 04:42.500
At the police station.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.710
They arrested
Connor and Michaela.

04:43.710 --> 04:44.710
Pam: Oliver.

04:46.290 --> 04:47.750
Please tell me they just
teepeed the Dean's house.

04:47.750 --> 04:48.750
Who is that?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.580
Uh, Pam, you need to sit.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.120
W-What did Connor do?

04:57.420 --> 05:00.920
Connor:

05:09.830 --> 05:11.210
Get a medic now!

05:11.210 --> 05:13.540
I need help in here!

05:13.540 --> 05:14.960
Help! Help!!

05:14.960 --> 05:16.040
Pam: I'm his mother.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.880
I have the right to see him.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.040
Will you help, please?

05:19.040 --> 05:20.790
Hey, Pam, let's --
let's sit.

05:20.790 --> 05:21.750
D-Do you have
any children?

05:21.750 --> 05:23.380
Eight.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.710
Then you understand
that I need to see my child.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.670
Pam, we need
to wait, okay?
Wait?

05:27.670 --> 05:29.580
Whose side
are you on here?

05:29.580 --> 05:31.920
Making the police mad
won't help us --
I am mad, Oliver!

05:31.920 --> 05:34.250
And you should be, too.
That is your job right now --
No.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.250
To get angry because
you love your husband --
I know.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.080
Well, then be a man
and fix it, damn it!

05:43.460 --> 05:45.250
Okay.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.670
I'm gonna call Jefferson.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.210
BP's normal.
Heart rate, too.

05:53.210 --> 05:54.830
Probably a panic attack.

05:54.830 --> 05:57.120
I know what
a panic attack is.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.540
This wasn't that.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.880
You need to take me
to the hospital right now

06:00.880 --> 06:02.500
or I-I might die in here.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.380
We'll take the risk.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.710
I'm not...

06:09.710 --> 06:10.920
I wasn't faking it.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.460
I didn't say you did.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.620
Then take me
to the hospital.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.710
Please.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.880
I'm begging. Please.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.250
I think you're okay here.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.460
Oli.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.880
Hey.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.040
Come on, guy.
Let's get you out of here.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.250
Sweet-O, look at me.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.830
Connor's smart.
He's gonna be fine.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.040
I did it!
Oliver!

06:49.040 --> 06:50.330
It was me!
I'm the murderer!

06:50.330 --> 06:51.580
Arrest me!

06:58.080 --> 06:59.830
Hey.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.620
Oliver just confessed.
What?

07:01.620 --> 07:03.830
As soon as I got here,
he went crazy.

07:03.830 --> 07:05.710
They're booking him now.

07:05.710 --> 07:06.710
I'll be there in 20.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.250
You couldn't sleep
last night either?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.880
Listen.
I think Annalise should file
a defamation suit

07:12.880 --> 07:14.290
against the FBI

07:14.290 --> 07:15.420
for letting that leak out
on the news.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.500
Tegan, we have a bigger problem
right now.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.420
Annalise is about to get charged
with a murder conspiracy.

07:19.420 --> 07:20.790
How could there be
anything bigger?

07:20.790 --> 07:22.460
Asher was killed
last night.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.710
Lanford: Was anyone else
with you last night?

07:25.710 --> 07:28.290
No. I came home
right after our meeting.

07:28.290 --> 07:30.290
And you heard nothing
all night long?

07:30.290 --> 07:31.830
No voices, a struggle?

07:31.830 --> 07:33.460
Nothing.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.580
I swear.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.040
I'm telling the truth.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.790
Gabriel, last night,
you came to me

07:38.790 --> 07:40.790
and asked if Annalise Keating
was responsible

07:40.790 --> 07:42.290
for your father's murder.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.420
Then, later that night,
your neighbor,

07:45.420 --> 07:47.290
a member of Annalise's
inner circle,

07:47.290 --> 07:50.420
turns up dead outside your door.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.210
You're a smart guy.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.210
How does that sound to you?

07:58.620 --> 08:00.040
I didn't do this.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.830
Bonnie: Michaela and Connor
were arrested.

08:01.830 --> 08:03.330
Tegan: Did they do it?
No.

08:03.330 --> 08:05.040
But they need lawyers.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.500
Where's Annalise?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.170
Gone.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.290
I'm sorry?
She's gone.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.670
That's also
why I'm here --

08:12.670 --> 08:14.500
to see if you helped her
disappear like you did Laurel.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.170
Don't. I know it was you.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.460
So if you did the same thing
for Annalise --
I didn't.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.920
How can I believe that?!

08:23.420 --> 08:25.380
Laurel blackmailed me.
That's why I helped her --

08:25.380 --> 08:27.120
because she threatened
to tell Jorge

08:27.120 --> 08:30.040
I was the Jane Doe
who got him put away.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.750
Who the hell
told you any of this?

08:35.620 --> 08:37.210
Asher?

08:37.210 --> 08:39.120
What are you doing here?

08:49.500 --> 08:50.790
Asher.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.420
Listen,
i-it's not what you think.

08:52.420 --> 08:53.790
You're covered in blood.

08:53.790 --> 08:54.880
Yeah, it's my blood.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.460
Oliver hit me
with the fireplace poker.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.290
Oliver?
It was the shrooms.
They made everyone paranoid.

08:58.290 --> 09:00.040
When Laurel called, they -- they
all just -- they turned on me.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.620
You're not making sense.

09:01.620 --> 09:02.620
Laurel called, and she said
that she's not the mole,

09:02.620 --> 09:04.210
which means
that she obviously is, or...

09:04.210 --> 09:05.620
maybe it's Tegan.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.580
Why Tegan?

09:06.580 --> 09:07.790
She's the one
that disappeared Laurel.

09:07.790 --> 09:09.040
Or that's what
Laurel said.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.420
But it means one of them
has to be the informant

09:10.420 --> 09:11.500
that we've been hearing about
on the news, right?

09:11.500 --> 09:12.580
I'm -- I mean,
I'm leaning towards Laurel

09:12.580 --> 09:13.540
'cause she knows
everything we've done --

09:13.540 --> 09:15.420
Sam, Sinclair,
Miller, and...

09:15.420 --> 09:16.790
remember how mad she was
when she found out

09:16.790 --> 09:19.670
that you killed Miller
in front of Christopher?

09:19.670 --> 09:21.080
She probably went
to the FBI then.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.710
I think losing all that blood
has you...confused.

09:30.380 --> 09:31.710
Maybe.

09:31.710 --> 09:32.880
I'll make you some tea.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.290
I can just go home.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.670
Sit down so we can figure out
what to do.

09:49.670 --> 09:50.880
Frank: What's up?

09:50.880 --> 09:51.880
Bonnie: Where are you?

09:51.880 --> 09:53.460
About to walk
into the kids' house.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.380
Don't go in.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.710
I need you here right now.

09:56.710 --> 09:57.500
What's wrong?

09:58.710 --> 10:00.170
Asher's here.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.000
So?

10:03.330 --> 10:04.670
I think it's him.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.330
He turned.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.500
Don't let him leave.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.620
Thanks.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.750
Who were you
on the phone with?

10:38.750 --> 10:41.460
Frank.

10:41.460 --> 10:44.080
He's coming here
and will drive you home.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.330
There's nothing
we can do tonight,

10:48.330 --> 10:50.620
and you have graduation
tomorrow.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.540
Obviously, I'm not --
I'm not going.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.210
It's gonna look suspicious
to the FBI if you don't show up.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.620
Just don't tell Frank
about Tegan helping Laurel.

10:59.620 --> 11:01.580
Why?

11:01.580 --> 11:04.620
You saw what happened last time
Frank went looking for Laurel.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.460
Let's protect him
from himself, okay?

11:07.460 --> 11:10.420
Okay.

11:16.380 --> 11:17.880
Morons for doing shrooms.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.540
Yeah, I know.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.540
Eh, let's just go.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.120
We'll figure it all out
tomorrow.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.420
Coffee?

11:55.420 --> 11:57.330
I'm sorry?
Frank Delfino.

11:57.330 --> 11:59.120
We met last Christmas
at the kids' house.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
Oh. Right.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.830
Why are you here?

12:03.830 --> 12:05.380
Oliver called me

12:05.380 --> 12:06.830
right after Connor and Michaela
were arrested.

12:06.830 --> 12:08.290
Clearly,
I got here too late

12:08.290 --> 12:09.830
to stop him
from playing the martyr.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.750
Oh. I think that's my fault.
I yelled at him pretty bad.

12:12.750 --> 12:13.960
Hey, this is traumatic.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.380
No blaming yourself.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.790
The good news is that I have
the managing partner

12:16.790 --> 12:18.540
from Caplan & Gold coming
to help everyone.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.750
No, Connor's father's
already called a lawyer.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.330
Well, who?
This is Philly.

12:22.330 --> 12:23.620
You need someone
who knows the city.

12:23.620 --> 12:25.380
No, we need someone

12:25.380 --> 12:27.960
who isn't beholden
to that insane woman.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.670
Sorry?

12:29.670 --> 12:30.710
Annalise.

12:30.710 --> 12:31.960
This is all her doing.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.420
No, that's not
what's happening.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.460
Connor told me the Governor has
been coming after all of them

12:35.460 --> 12:37.000
since the Supreme Court win.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.960
That is Annalise's fault.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.250
Trust me, we're not gonna let
him go down for any of this.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.710
"We"?

12:45.710 --> 12:46.920
I just wanna help Connor --

12:46.920 --> 12:48.960
Leave.

12:48.960 --> 12:52.250
Or I will scream
to this whole station

12:52.250 --> 12:53.750
that you're harassing me.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.540
You're shook, I get it,
but I'm here to help.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.330
Who told you?
Bonnie.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.290
I stopped at the crime scene
on my way here.

13:20.290 --> 13:21.210
Which was where?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.790
The landing
outside Asher's apartment.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.830
I overheard a tech say

13:31.830 --> 13:35.040
he was hit multiple times
with a fireplace poker,

13:35.040 --> 13:37.710
also found
at the crime scene.

13:37.710 --> 13:40.000
Someone put that there
to frame us.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.880
Xavier's people.
I know.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.120
I am so sorry, Michaela.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.290
There aren't a lot
of good ones out there,

13:48.290 --> 13:49.540
but Asher was one of them.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.500
You barely knew him.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.880
I know you cared for him.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.750
I cared for Laurel, too.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.170
I did what Laurel asked,

14:05.170 --> 14:08.420
protecting her from the same
people who did this to Asher.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.710
I don't believe you.
You don't have a choice
to not believe me, Michaela.

14:10.710 --> 14:13.380
I'm all you have here,
and I'm damn good at what I do,

14:13.380 --> 14:16.330
just like I was damn good
at helping Laurel go MIA

14:16.330 --> 14:18.250
so that she and that baby
could be safe.

14:20.210 --> 14:22.080
And it wasn't my secret
to tell.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.830
So, if you're gonna be pissed,
be pissed at Laurel,

14:25.830 --> 14:28.420
but we have work to do if we're
gonna get you out of here.

14:30.210 --> 14:31.880
Connor:
This is a game.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.920
They're trying
to get in your head.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.420
The security cameras will prove
that you never left the house.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.750
There are people
who want to frame us.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.670
Oh, thank God.

14:42.670 --> 14:45.250
It's going to be okay.
No, it's not.
How's Connor?

14:45.250 --> 14:46.420
I'll try to see him
after this.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.040
No, you have to
go see him now!

14:48.040 --> 14:49.620
Just sign this

14:49.620 --> 14:51.880
so I can represent you
at the bail hearing.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.210
It's in two hours.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.120
What?

14:57.120 --> 14:59.960
Uh, I was wearing
Laurel's gloves.

15:01.380 --> 15:04.210
That's why my prints weren't
on the poker, but I did it.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.210
I hit Asher.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.880
That's not
what killed him.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.380
I hit him hard.
It might've been a slow bleed.

15:09.380 --> 15:12.750
Listen to me --
He could have fainted
and fallen down the stairs.

15:12.750 --> 15:15.880
I saw him after he left
your house last night, Oliver.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.120
Uh...what did he tell you?

15:18.120 --> 15:20.620
That you all accused him
of being the informant.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.000
No, he admitted
that he was.
I know.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.580
The only reason
he came over

15:24.580 --> 15:28.460
was to record me
saying something incriminating.

15:35.290 --> 15:36.880
It wasn't me.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.710
Killing an FBI informant

15:38.710 --> 15:41.120
is the dumbest move
any of us could make.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.790
Unless you and Frank
framed someone else.

15:43.790 --> 15:45.380
Oliver, look at me.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.880
This is what
Xavier wants --

15:48.880 --> 15:51.920
for all of us to point
the finger at each other.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.290
Don't fall for it.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.620
Sign, and I'll get you
out of here.

16:05.710 --> 16:06.710
How'd it go?

16:06.710 --> 16:07.670
Oliver signed.

16:07.670 --> 16:08.500
Michaela?

16:08.500 --> 16:09.790
No go.

16:09.790 --> 16:11.170
Why?

16:11.170 --> 16:12.960
She already hired
a lawyer.

16:20.330 --> 16:22.670
I'm so sorry.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.880
Hey. It's okay.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.670
It's okay.
You're not alone anymore.

16:27.670 --> 16:29.710
I just didn't know
who else to call.

16:29.710 --> 16:32.580
Hey.

16:32.580 --> 16:37.500
I'm exactly the right person
to have called, okay?

16:39.040 --> 16:40.000
This is Kendra Strauss.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.040
She is a partner
at, uh, Baldwin --

16:42.040 --> 16:43.580
Strauss and Morris.

16:43.580 --> 16:46.210
You got that hedge fund guy
out on self-defense.

16:46.210 --> 16:47.580
Exactly.

16:47.580 --> 16:48.500
She is the best.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.120
We're gonna fix this,
Michaela.

16:50.120 --> 16:55.040
But first, I need to know
if you've made any statements.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.960
God no.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.500
Told you she was smart.

17:04.170 --> 17:05.830
Sorry.

17:05.830 --> 17:08.330
Hey, it's alright.
It's alright.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.120
I swear, I...

17:13.120 --> 17:13.960
I didn't do this.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.290
Hey.

17:15.290 --> 17:18.120
Never once did I think
you did this.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.210
I'm not leaving
until we get you out of here.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.170
Oli's got
quite an arm on him, huh?

17:43.170 --> 17:44.580
Yeah.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.920
D-Did you or Bonnie, uh,
talk to him,

17:50.920 --> 17:53.540
or to Connor or Michaela?

17:53.540 --> 17:54.580
No.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.750
Should we?

17:56.750 --> 18:00.330
I'm just, uh, hurt,
to be honest.

18:02.210 --> 18:05.380
That they'd think I could...

18:05.380 --> 18:07.380
lie to all your faces
this whole time.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.880
We're all pretty good liars
at this point, no?

18:14.790 --> 18:16.250
What if it's Annalise?

18:16.250 --> 18:17.580
Hmm?

18:19.250 --> 18:22.120
If she's the mole,
I mean.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.210
She knows everything
we've done --

18:24.210 --> 18:26.040
you too --
shooting Wallace Mahoney,

18:26.040 --> 18:27.420
framing Nate for Sam...

18:31.880 --> 18:34.120
Those shrooms
making you hallucinate?

18:37.080 --> 18:39.460
Maybe.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.920
I guess I need sleep.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.960
I'll walk you up.
Oh, you don't have to.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.710
You're high.

18:45.710 --> 18:47.250
You probably have
a concussion from the blow.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.080
We don't want you
falling down the stairs.

19:07.330 --> 19:08.330
What?

19:08.330 --> 19:09.830
Asher.

19:09.830 --> 19:11.170
What about him?

19:12.500 --> 19:13.460
You really didn't hear?

19:13.460 --> 19:14.420
Hear what?

19:14.420 --> 19:15.540
Dead.

19:17.710 --> 19:20.040
Apparently, he told the kids
he was the mole.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.500
A few hours later,
his head was bashed in

19:21.500 --> 19:23.580
with a fireplace poker
at his apartment.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.710
FBI's got Connor, Michaela,
Oliver in jail.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.500
You and Annalise do it?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.380
Nah, don't be stupid.
This was Xavier.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.250
What better way
to hit back at us

19:33.250 --> 19:35.080
than to kill the guy
informing against us?

19:39.420 --> 19:41.040
Good luck proving that.

19:42.290 --> 19:43.830
You need to be worried
about this, too.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.540
Why?

19:45.540 --> 19:47.880
Asher knew you killed Miller,
which means so does the FBI.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.750
Good.
Tell Annalise I said that.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.580
She's gone.

19:52.580 --> 19:53.420
Where?

19:54.580 --> 19:56.880
No clue.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.080
Unless you know.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.710
Don't come
back here again.

20:09.460 --> 20:13.750
Judge Vitkay:
This is bail hearing 34-CR-4271,

20:13.750 --> 20:17.620
the United States vs.
co-defendants Walsh and Pratt.

20:17.620 --> 20:18.960
The top charge

20:18.960 --> 20:21.330
is the first-degree murder
of Asher Millstone.

20:21.330 --> 20:23.290
AUSA Montes,
it's my understanding

20:23.290 --> 20:25.120
that you've added
an additional defendant?

20:25.120 --> 20:26.170
Yes, Your Honor.

20:26.170 --> 20:28.420
In addition to Ms. Pratt
and Mr. Walsh,

20:28.420 --> 20:30.960
we're charging Oliver Hampton
with first-degree murder.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.540
We ask that the court deny bail
for all three defendants

20:33.540 --> 20:36.500
due to the extremely violent
nature of the killing.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.120
Evidence?

20:38.120 --> 20:39.880
We've identified Mr. Walsh
and Ms. Pratt's fingerprints

20:39.880 --> 20:41.380
on the murder weapon,

20:41.380 --> 20:43.500
and all of the defendants
had a clear motive

20:43.500 --> 20:45.330
to silence
a federal informant

20:45.330 --> 20:47.420
who was providing
criminal evidence against them.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.330
Defense counsel for Ms. Pratt,
your response?

20:51.620 --> 20:53.830
The government's evidence
against Ms. Pratt

20:53.830 --> 20:56.420
won't survive a probable cause
hearing, Your Honor.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.580
The only thing tying her
to this crime?

20:58.580 --> 21:00.620
Her fingerprints
on a fireplace poker

21:00.620 --> 21:02.920
my client used
as a household item

21:02.920 --> 21:05.170
many times before
Mr. Millstone's murder.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.170
The FBI denied Mr. Walsh
medical assistance

21:08.170 --> 21:10.960
after he had a severe
panic attack in custody.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.750
I therefore demand Mr. Walsh's

21:12.750 --> 21:14.920
immediate transfer
to a hospital.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.710
Mr. Hampton's only been charged
because of confession

21:17.710 --> 21:20.000
made under the influence
of psychedelic drugs,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.460
a confession that is
the government's only evidence

21:22.460 --> 21:24.120
against my client.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.670
Actually, we have more evidence
against Mr. Hampton, Your Honor.

21:27.670 --> 21:31.250
A voicemail Mr. Millstone
left a federal agent

21:31.250 --> 21:32.790
just hours
before he was killed.

21:32.790 --> 21:37.420
It shows Mr. Hampton and all
of the defendants had motive.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.920
Asher: It's Asher Millstone.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.460
The others saw the news
and figured out it's me.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.790
I just ran out of the house.
Please call me back.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.540
There is no proof these "others"
include my client.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.710
When Mr. Millstone
called the FBI,

21:50.710 --> 21:52.580
his phone pinged
a cell tower

21:52.580 --> 21:55.920
nearest to the house where
all three co-defendants live.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.420
Cell towers don't pinpoint
exact locations.

21:58.420 --> 22:00.120
This is all circumstantial,
Your Honor.

22:01.710 --> 22:03.380
Understood.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.250
Any additional arguments
for bail,

22:06.250 --> 22:07.960
or can I give my ruling?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.960
Good.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.500
I'm denying bail
to defendants Walsh and Pratt,

22:17.500 --> 22:18.830
who shall be held in custody
pending trial.

22:20.670 --> 22:23.460
However, I agree
there's not enough evidence

22:23.460 --> 22:25.540
to charge Mr. Hampton
at this time.

22:25.540 --> 22:28.330
I'm therefore dismissing
the charges against him

22:28.330 --> 22:30.040
and ordering his release.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.290
No! No!
No, they're all murderers!

22:33.290 --> 22:35.750
Order! Order in the court!
Okay, all three --
they need to go to jail!

22:35.750 --> 22:37.880
Officer, escort her outside.
No, Asher tried
to do the right thing,

22:37.880 --> 22:39.580
and they killed him!
They killed my brother!
Take the defendants
into custody.

22:39.580 --> 22:41.830
Order! Order in the court!
He's dead, so they need to
die now, too!

22:41.830 --> 22:43.670
They're all murderers!

22:43.670 --> 22:45.000
They need to die now, too!

22:50.170 --> 22:53.790
Okay. Home safe and sound.
All good.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.040
I gotta take a leak.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.040
Expecting a call?

23:31.040 --> 23:34.170
No, just, uh...

23:34.170 --> 23:35.960
checking the news to see
if anything else came out.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.040
Like what?

23:46.210 --> 23:48.380
Come on.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.120
We're not getting
away with it, are we?

23:51.960 --> 23:53.710
We're just kidding ourselves.

23:53.710 --> 23:54.750
You're just tired,
that's all.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.250
No, I-I just...

23:57.250 --> 24:00.210
I don't know
how we got here.

24:00.210 --> 24:02.500
Remember when
we were buds? We...

24:02.500 --> 24:05.040
We watched the Eagles together.
You gave me dating tips.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.880
I-I helped you study
for the LSAT.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.750
What's going on
in your head?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.170
I-I think I just need a hug.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.420
I never thought
you were a bad guy, Frank.

24:30.420 --> 24:32.250
Everything you ever did,

24:32.250 --> 24:33.670
I-I know you just did it
to protect us --

24:33.670 --> 24:35.710
Hey.

24:35.710 --> 24:39.170
The only thing I ever did
for you was be your friend.

24:41.330 --> 24:42.750
Don't go to sleep.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.920
It's bad for concussions.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.420
Automated voicemail:
Your call has been forwarded

25:04.420 --> 25:06.420
to an automated
voice-messaging system.

25:06.420 --> 25:07.500
At the tone, please record --

25:15.460 --> 25:18.710
Nate claims he had no idea
Annalise was gone.

25:18.710 --> 25:21.040
You think he helped her?

25:21.040 --> 25:23.620
Hell, maybe he helped Laurel
disappear, too.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.670
What is it?

25:27.670 --> 25:30.960
Nate wasn't who helped
Laurel disappear.

25:40.170 --> 25:41.580
Hey.

25:41.580 --> 25:42.750
Bonnie told you?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.710
Where are they?

25:44.710 --> 25:45.830
I don't know.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.170
How the hell
is that possible?

25:47.170 --> 25:49.290
I know a guy in Mexico
who does this.

25:49.290 --> 25:50.420
So, they're in Mexico?

25:50.420 --> 25:51.750
I don't know.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.330
I gave her his number.

25:53.330 --> 25:55.210
She arranged the details
without me.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.880
And even if I did know
where she was,

26:00.880 --> 26:02.710
telling you would risk having
Laurel and Christopher

26:02.710 --> 26:03.710
end up like Asher.

26:03.710 --> 26:05.670
Is that what you want?

26:05.670 --> 26:07.500
All this time,

26:07.500 --> 26:09.420
we thought she could be
chained up in a well.

26:09.420 --> 26:12.080
Annalise almost drank herself
to death 'cause of it.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.880
And I hated myself
the whole time.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.540
But you know what?

26:16.540 --> 26:21.330
Annalise just took off
without a thought about me.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.540
So I'm hating myself
a little less right now.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.250
I'm sorry Laurel hurt you,

26:28.250 --> 26:30.380
but that's between you two.

26:32.790 --> 26:34.460
Now,
can I get in my car,

26:34.460 --> 26:36.250
or are you gonna make me
use my mace?

26:46.540 --> 26:49.380
We appreciate you
sitting down with us today.

26:49.380 --> 26:50.710
Like we have a choice.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.880
Pam.
Just -- Don't you dare
shush me again.

26:54.670 --> 26:56.330
Drop the charges,

26:56.330 --> 26:58.000
otherwise we sue you
and this whole state

26:58.000 --> 26:59.210
for wrongful prosecution,
and I will --

26:59.210 --> 27:01.330
Mrs. Walsh, I'm sorry
this is so upsetting,

27:01.330 --> 27:04.080
but today's charges against
your son were just the start.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.120
In addition to
the Millstone murder,

27:06.120 --> 27:07.880
we have evidence linking
Ms. Pratt

27:07.880 --> 27:09.290
to several more crimes.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.330
You'll need time
to review them all,

27:11.330 --> 27:13.120
but the highlights
are conspiracy,

27:13.120 --> 27:14.750
aiding and abetting,
perjury,

27:14.750 --> 27:15.830
obstruction of justice --

27:15.830 --> 27:17.540
Evidence tampering?

27:17.540 --> 27:21.040
For when you helped hide
the murder of D.A. Miller.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.580
A wedding
was a convenient alibi

27:23.580 --> 27:25.080
for D.A. Miller's killing.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.710
We're ending this meeting

27:26.710 --> 27:29.580
if you continue to drum up
ludicrous accusations.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.210
You don't want to know
the other evidence first?

27:33.540 --> 27:35.330
Victim intimidation
of Simon Drake.

27:35.330 --> 27:37.330
Assault by
the unauthorized intoxication

27:37.330 --> 27:38.670
of Catherine Hapstall.

27:38.670 --> 27:41.500
Retaliation against
District Attorney Todd Denver.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.000
The murder
of A.D.A. Emily Sinclair.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.620
Caleb Hapstall.
Rebecca Sutter.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.620
All deaths stemming from
the first murder

27:47.620 --> 27:51.380
and dismemberment
of Sam Keating.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.290
Which is why you had to
kill Asher Millstone --

27:53.290 --> 27:56.080
to keep him from informing
on Sam's murder

27:56.080 --> 27:57.080
and everything
that came after.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.670
Then charge me.
Connor.

27:58.670 --> 28:02.290
If you have the evidence,
then charge me for all of it.

28:02.290 --> 28:04.080
You can't, though,
right?

28:04.080 --> 28:05.960
That's why the AUSA
isn't here?

28:05.960 --> 28:08.330
The AUSA isn't here because
you're being shady.

28:08.330 --> 28:10.620
This is all some
weak-ass scare tactic

28:10.620 --> 28:12.330
to bully us into giving
a false confession.

28:12.330 --> 28:14.540
Call our bluff.
We'll see you at trial.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.620
Or?

28:17.250 --> 28:19.960
Admit that you did all of it,
not because you wanted to,

28:19.960 --> 28:22.330
but because you were under
the influence of one person --

28:22.330 --> 28:24.540
Annalise Keating.

28:24.540 --> 28:27.000
Annalise Keating.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.500
If you want Keating
so bad,

28:28.500 --> 28:30.000
why haven't you
arrested her?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.380
Ms. Keating's missing.

28:31.380 --> 28:32.920
What?
What?

28:32.920 --> 28:35.290
We believe
she fled the country.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.500
We'll find her
and we'll take her to trial,

28:37.500 --> 28:40.250
but in order to make
our case, we need help.

28:40.250 --> 28:43.710
We're offering you
an immunity deal, Ms. Pratt.

28:43.710 --> 28:46.420
We're offering you
an immunity deal, Mr. Walsh.

28:48.290 --> 28:51.380
Plead guilty to all
the crimes listed here

28:51.380 --> 28:53.620
and agree to testify against
Ms. Keating at trial...

28:53.620 --> 28:57.750
And agree to testify
against Ms. Keating at trial,

28:57.750 --> 28:59.830
including the fact
that she ordered you

28:59.830 --> 29:01.290
to murder Sam Keating.

29:01.290 --> 29:03.330
Including the fact

29:03.330 --> 29:07.500
that she ordered you
to kill Sam Keating.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.920
Agree and you'll get
five years.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.580
For everything.

29:11.580 --> 29:12.960
For everything.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.960
You just need
to sign today

29:14.960 --> 29:16.920
and we'll immediately
release you.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.290
Don't sign...

29:19.290 --> 29:22.500
and you'll stay in jail
until your trial,

29:22.500 --> 29:26.000
where the AUSA will try
for a life sentence.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.580
You have until 5:00 p.m.
to decide.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.460
Asher: ...Sam, Sinclair,
Miller, and...

29:43.460 --> 29:44.620
remember how mad she was
when she found out

29:44.620 --> 29:45.920
that you killed Miller
in front of Christopher?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.290
Bonnie: I think
losing all that blood

29:47.290 --> 29:49.670
has you...confused.

29:49.670 --> 29:51.620
Asher: I never thought you were
a bad guy, Frank.

29:51.620 --> 29:53.330
Everything you ever did,

29:53.330 --> 29:55.960
I know you just did it
to protect us.
Frank: Hey.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.000
The only thing I ever did
for you was be your friend.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.790
D-Damn it!

30:09.920 --> 30:11.750
Stupid, stupid, stupid, Asher.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.500
Stupid, dumb rage monster.

30:24.830 --> 30:26.750
You alone?

30:26.750 --> 30:28.040
Yeah.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.710
Did Frank do it?

30:38.710 --> 30:40.210
What?

30:40.210 --> 30:42.880
My contact at PD says they
know Asher came over here

30:42.880 --> 30:45.420
and that Frank
drove him home after.

30:45.420 --> 30:48.540
Just look me in the eye
and tell me it wasn't Frank.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.830
It wasn't.

30:50.830 --> 30:53.170
The police
clearly know that, too,

30:53.170 --> 30:55.170
since we're not the ones
in jail.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.880
Why do you even care?

30:59.880 --> 31:01.120
You said you were done
with all of us.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.330
Done with Annalise, yeah,

31:03.330 --> 31:06.250
like she's clearly done
with all of you.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.830
But I'm not done
doing what's right.

31:08.830 --> 31:11.250
"What's right"?

31:11.250 --> 31:12.380
You?

31:14.380 --> 31:16.790
Do you have any idea
how many times

31:16.790 --> 31:18.960
I've played that night over
in my head?

31:18.960 --> 31:21.420
I chose you over Ron.

31:21.420 --> 31:22.750
I didn't ask you
to do that.

31:22.750 --> 31:23.830
He was innocent.

31:23.830 --> 31:25.210
He could have stopped
the whole thing.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.620
Reported Xavier
to the feds.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.500
That coward
son of a bitch

31:29.500 --> 31:32.500
let an old man get shot
point-blank in the head.

31:37.380 --> 31:40.080
You wanna actually move on
from all of this

31:40.080 --> 31:42.040
and be the hero
you think you are?

31:42.040 --> 31:44.170
Just turn yourself in.

31:47.380 --> 31:49.580
I am sorry about Asher.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.170
Michaela: What do you
think I should do?

31:57.580 --> 31:59.710
It's not my call.

32:03.460 --> 32:04.880
What if it were, though?

32:07.290 --> 32:08.880
Please.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.790
I really want to know.

32:11.790 --> 32:13.830
I'm with Kendra.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.620
You take the deal.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.380
Connor:
It's not that simple.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.210
They want us to lie

32:19.210 --> 32:21.500
and say that Annalise
told us to kill Sam.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.750
Is that such a bad thing?

32:25.210 --> 32:26.830
You could get
a life sentence.

32:26.830 --> 32:29.000
Maybe I deserve that.
You're my husband.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.540
You're who I care about here,
not Annalise.

32:31.540 --> 32:33.880
Annalise isn't to blame
for all of this.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.120
But she is to blame
for most of it, right?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.540
And don't forget,
Michaela,

32:37.540 --> 32:40.290
I have known her
for a long time,

32:40.290 --> 32:43.420
and what you're doing,
worrying about her,

32:43.420 --> 32:45.460
is not something she would do
for you right now.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.880
She ran away,
saved her own ass.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.620
Now you gotta do
the same thing.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.710
Oliver: What if this
was Annalise?

32:52.710 --> 32:55.880
For all we know, she killed
Asher and she framed you.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.210
You're reaching.
Am I?

32:57.210 --> 32:59.120
Maybe Asher
was right all along.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.500
She got you into this.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.170
She should go down.

33:02.170 --> 33:05.170
And, look, I know five years
sounds like a long time,

33:05.170 --> 33:08.210
but I'll be here
the whole time.

33:08.210 --> 33:10.380
I just want this
to be over

33:10.380 --> 33:12.170
so that we can go have

33:12.170 --> 33:16.210
a boring, normative life
together.

33:16.210 --> 33:19.000
What about Michaela?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.920
What if Connor
doesn't take the deal?

33:20.920 --> 33:22.540
They'll still charge him.

33:22.540 --> 33:24.420
My deal could
sentence him to life.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.670
Did you not hear me?

33:25.670 --> 33:29.330
First Annalise,
now that spoiled white boy?

33:29.330 --> 33:33.330
The only person you need
to think about here...

33:33.330 --> 33:34.920
is you.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.380
He's always had my back.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.790
And who's got his back?

33:37.790 --> 33:41.290
His husband, two parents,
history.

33:41.290 --> 33:45.000
You know a jury's not gonna
treat the two of you the same.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.290
Oliver: Michaela
got Simon deported,

33:47.290 --> 33:50.880
and she pushed Sam
over the railing, not you.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.000
I mean, what
have you done? Really?

33:52.000 --> 33:53.670
I told you.

33:53.670 --> 33:55.420
No, everything you did with Sam
was after the fact.

33:55.420 --> 33:57.290
You didn't instigate
anything bad.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.670
That's not true.
Then what have you done?

33:59.670 --> 34:01.670
I got you involved.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.210
I got myself involved.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.040
You always begged me
to stop.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.460
Please, if you want
to make it up to me,

34:07.460 --> 34:11.210
then just...sign...

34:11.210 --> 34:14.710
and come home
with me tonight.

34:14.710 --> 34:16.540
Okay? Just -- Please.
I'll do anything.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.420
Just sign.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.250
Michaela: What am I gonna do
after I get out?

34:21.250 --> 34:22.830
There's no way
I'll get to be a lawyer.

34:22.830 --> 34:24.120
You don't know that.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.380
They want me to plead guilty
to a dozen felonies.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.210
How do you think I got
to where I am, Michaela?

34:29.210 --> 34:32.210
I know people everywhere --
at the bar, too.

34:32.210 --> 34:34.330
And we will make you
a lawyer.

34:34.330 --> 34:37.790
I promise to use
every resource I have

34:37.790 --> 34:41.670
to get your sentence reduced,
your record sealed.

34:41.670 --> 34:44.210
Then you can come
to California with me,

34:44.210 --> 34:46.210
change your name to Vick
if you want.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.290
But me?

34:49.290 --> 34:53.290
Michaela, it's time...
that I be your father,

34:53.290 --> 34:55.380
and that means telling you
the truth.

You'll see soon.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.170
Please.
No more surprises.

35:58.170 --> 36:01.040
I don't know either,
is the point.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.790
That's the fun part.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.670
Let's go.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.120
Damn it!

36:42.210 --> 36:44.670
Frank:
I wish that I had killed Sam.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.670
Maybe killing his son's
the next best thing.

37:02.830 --> 37:04.290
Hey.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.380
What the hell?

37:07.380 --> 37:09.210
I'm fine.
Just -- I-I need your phone.

37:09.210 --> 37:10.380
For what?
It's an emergency.

37:10.380 --> 37:11.750
Give me your phone.
No.

37:11.750 --> 37:13.120
Wait.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.170
I'll pay you $64,000
for it.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.120
Don't let yourself feel
any guilt here.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.880
You made
a smart decision.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.830
So lower my sentence
to no years.

37:39.830 --> 37:42.040
It's not my call, sadly.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.580
But what I can tell you is

37:43.580 --> 37:45.080
you're gonna make
a great lawyer someday.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.460
Don't patronize me.

37:46.460 --> 37:48.290
I'm serious.

37:48.290 --> 37:50.290
You convinced us to give you
a better deal.

37:50.290 --> 37:52.250
You think
that happens often?

37:52.250 --> 37:53.920
Michaela:
I'm ready to sign.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.670
That's great news.

37:55.670 --> 37:58.710
But I have a stipulation.
Otherwise, we go to trial.

38:06.380 --> 38:07.880
I got you a room
at the hotel.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.420
Entire room service menu

38:09.420 --> 38:11.120
should be waiting
when we get there.

38:13.670 --> 38:15.080
Michaela?

38:22.580 --> 38:24.210
But I have a stipulation.

38:24.210 --> 38:26.500
The terms of the deal
are only valid

38:26.500 --> 38:29.330
if they apply to both Connor
and myself.

38:29.330 --> 38:31.500
Protect us equally...

38:31.500 --> 38:33.500
or we don't have a deal.

38:47.710 --> 38:49.380
You're welcome.

38:50.460 --> 38:51.920
What?

38:51.920 --> 38:54.580
Well, I-I made sure
we got the same deal.

38:54.580 --> 38:56.040
No.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.170
I made sure we got
the same deal.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.670
I'm only signing if you
agree to one more term.

39:00.670 --> 39:02.330
Which is?

39:02.330 --> 39:05.120
Michaela gets
the same protections I do...

39:05.120 --> 39:07.210
even if she doesn't sign.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.170
Great minds.

39:11.170 --> 39:13.120
Brilliant minds.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.920
Oliver: Connor.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.790
Thank God.

39:16.790 --> 39:18.500
I love you so much.

39:20.460 --> 39:23.120
Oh.

39:28.380 --> 39:29.830
Desi:
¿Esta cerrada la autopista?

39:29.830 --> 39:33.120
¿Que tal el puente?

39:33.120 --> 39:36.330
Pues tenemos que buscar otro
camino y hacer lo mejor.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.750
Confia en mi.

39:38.750 --> 39:40.290
Something wrong?

39:40.290 --> 39:42.380
We have to hurry.
Hurry where?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.000
We've been walking
for over an hour.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.920
They might know
you're here.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.210
Who?
I don't know.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.670
Come. Quick.

39:52.540 --> 39:55.500
I just got off the phone
with my "in" at the PD.

39:55.500 --> 39:58.040
They dropped the charges
against Connor and Michaela.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.170
Think they took a deal?

40:00.170 --> 40:02.830
What do you think?

40:02.830 --> 40:04.830
Hey.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.920
We'll make it
through this.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.580
Frank?

40:09.580 --> 40:11.330
What?

40:11.330 --> 40:13.540
Was it you?

40:14.670 --> 40:16.120
