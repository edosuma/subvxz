02:43.863 --> 02:45.194
Come on.

02:46.666 --> 02:47.833
This is ridiculous.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.700
What is the deal
with these people?

02:54.874 --> 02:56.809
KCBG.
Who are you holding for?

02:56.809 --> 02:59.445
Listen, I've been trying
to get ahold of Lori Tanner...

02:59.445 --> 03:01.013
for the last ten minutes.

03:01.013 --> 03:03.249
I'm sorry. She's not picking up
in her office right now.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.252
Yeah, well, tell her
she just lost her story.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.621
Hold on. Maybe she's
somewhere else in the building.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.423
Let me try and locate her.

03:10.423 --> 03:14.160
Wrinkle-free dirt-repellent
polyester...

03:14.160 --> 03:16.028
Is this working for you so far?

03:16.028 --> 03:19.965
Is trying to make a comeback
from the disco decade.

03:19.965 --> 03:23.069
Edit bay one.

03:23.069 --> 03:24.704
Yeah, hold on a second.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.040
...is finding new life
among top clothing designers.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.744
Hi, this is Judy Sanders
over at Emax.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.747
Oh, God, Judy!
Thanks for calling me back.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.749
It's not my fault we're stuck
with this lightweight...

03:36.749 --> 03:38.551
Shh! It's important.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.052
I didn't expect
to hear from you again.

03:40.052 --> 03:44.223
Look, I can sneak you
into the lab tomorrow night...

03:44.223 --> 03:46.325
if you've still got
that five hundred you promised.

03:46.325 --> 03:48.361
Yeah, yeah.
I just have to make sure...

03:48.361 --> 03:49.562
you can get me in
to see the animals.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.464
I got to know exactly
what's being done to them.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.631
No problem.

03:52.631 --> 03:55.968
Why don't you meet me
at 8:30 at the north gate?

03:55.968 --> 03:58.537
And don't be late. I can't
afford to get in trouble.

03:58.537 --> 04:01.407
I'll be there.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.500
Yes! Yes!

04:12.084 --> 04:14.286
Good morning, Mr. Perez.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.154
Buenas dias, Señor Perez.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.749
Buenas dias, Señor Perez.

04:20.559 --> 04:22.762
How are you, Mrs. Perez?

04:22.762 --> 04:25.464
¿Como esta usted, Señora Perez?

04:25.464 --> 04:28.558
¿Como esta usted, señora?

04:30.002 --> 04:32.371
How are you, Miss Perez?

04:32.371 --> 04:34.940
¿Como esta usted,
Señorita Perez?

04:34.940 --> 04:37.033
¿Como esta... shut up!

04:38.878 --> 04:41.881
- Hello, sir.
- Hola, señor.

04:41.881 --> 04:44.650
Hola, señor.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.952
- Hello, madame.
- Hola, señora.

04:46.952 --> 04:48.783
Hola, señ...

04:51.690 --> 04:53.749
Ladies and gentlemen.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.398
I am pleased to meet you.

04:59.398 --> 05:01.559
Mucho gusto en conocerle.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.295
- Thank you.
- Gracias.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.407
- Please.
- Por favor.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.044
- Goodbye.
- Adios.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.646
This is exactly the type
of story I've been looking for.

05:47.646 --> 05:49.482
What do you know
about animal rights?

05:49.482 --> 05:51.116
You have a parrot
that can't stand you.

05:51.116 --> 05:52.818
It's topical. It's hard-hitting.

05:52.818 --> 05:54.653
I think I can do something
significant with it.

05:54.653 --> 05:56.956
Do an expose. Who knows
what goes on in that place?

05:56.956 --> 05:59.325
We're already running late
on the polyester segment.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.460
Polyester segment.
Please, give me a break.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.295
Drip-dry suits.
That's real hard-core.

06:03.295 --> 06:06.999
Excuse me, but that's what
we get paid to do around here.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.767
How many times
have we had this discussion...

06:08.767 --> 06:12.071
about what we'd do if we got
a chance to cover a real story?

06:12.071 --> 06:14.206
No, I'm not going to let you
do this to me again.

06:14.206 --> 06:16.108
You've got to shoot this one
for me, Annie. You're the best.

06:16.108 --> 06:18.177
Why can't we be
like everybody else, huh?

06:18.177 --> 06:20.946
It doesn't make sense to shoot
the whole story on spec.

06:20.946 --> 06:23.082
We should just sell everybody
on the idea first.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.885
No! Because they'll just go
and put somebody else on it.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.254
The only way we're ever gonna
get to do anything real here...

06:28.254 --> 06:31.857
is if we just shoot the story
and blow their socks off.

06:31.857 --> 06:34.223
I'm doing this
with or without you.

06:46.071 --> 06:47.663
Come on. Bring it up.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.680
What is the deal? It's 9:00.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.416
What's her name... Judy... said
she'd meet us here at 8:30.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.815
Maybe we should just
get out of here.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.512
There's no answer. Damn it.

07:05.257 --> 07:06.792
What are you doing?

07:06.792 --> 07:08.427
I'm sneaking in.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.996
Lori.

07:10.996 --> 07:12.565
Lori!

07:12.565 --> 07:13.691
Wait.

07:17.636 --> 07:18.864
Lori, wait for me.

07:20.406 --> 07:23.108
Did your wife fix me up
with her sister yet or what?

07:23.108 --> 07:26.645
On second thought, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

07:26.645 --> 07:30.683
I found out she won't be
turning 18 for another 8 months.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.985
Hey, that's perfect, man.

07:32.985 --> 07:35.955
If I was you,
I'd rewrite that personal ad.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.122
Oh, come on, man.

07:37.122 --> 07:39.291
I haven't gotten a date
from that personal ad.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.293
Hey, listen, I was taking
a creative writing course...

07:41.293 --> 07:42.661
one time in community college.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.630
I'll help you with it
on my off night.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.131
We'll get together,
we'll rewrite the thing.

07:46.131 --> 07:47.666
Those things don't work.

07:47.666 --> 07:50.669
I got one more inside
we got to get.

07:50.669 --> 07:54.070
So, yeah, we'll just get
together, like, Wednesday night.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.639
What's that smell?

08:05.584 --> 08:07.916
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.423
Shoot it. Shoot it.

08:11.423 --> 08:12.549
OK.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.762
I don't eat doughnuts all day.

08:16.762 --> 08:19.131
I eat doughnuts in the evening.
I eat candy bars in the morning.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.800
Listen, you should try driving
with this shit in your trunk.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.968
You ever get a whiff
of this shit?

08:22.968 --> 08:25.204
It stinks.
I'll buy you some air freshener.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.330
How do you like that?

08:40.119 --> 08:42.121
This must be the place.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.390
Got everything?

08:44.390 --> 08:46.483
Have I ever forgotten anything
before?

08:49.528 --> 08:50.654
Let's do it.

08:56.101 --> 08:57.693
Oh, my God.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.145
Look at this. Look at this.
Annie, tape the rabbit.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.413
Got it, got it, got it.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.005
Hey, pan down the row.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.352
Look. They took her ear off.

09:13.352 --> 09:16.021
Move in on this one. This one.

09:16.021 --> 09:17.989
Look at the size of this wound.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.294
Now pull back and get the name
of this monkey.

09:22.294 --> 09:25.197
OK, stay out of the shot.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.866
These people are sick. Look.

09:27.866 --> 09:29.835
Look at her head.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.937
And the tattoo on her face, too.

09:31.937 --> 09:34.167
This is unbelievable.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.610
- Bring your camera up here.
- Hold on, I'm coming.

09:38.610 --> 09:41.046
Look at this place.
Look at this place.

09:41.046 --> 09:44.016
We've got to get this whole shot
of the whole place.

09:44.016 --> 09:47.286
I want people to really see
what's going on in here.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.754
What kind of person
could do all this?

09:51.724 --> 09:54.124
- Fifty-five, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.132
Did he take everything, Manning?

10:00.132 --> 10:01.333
Yes, sir, Dr. Jarret.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.302
Meet me around back.
I got some specimens...

10:03.302 --> 10:04.929
I want you to help me
take up to the lab.

10:07.906 --> 10:09.032
Damn.

10:15.714 --> 10:17.875
I'm not so sure about this.

10:20.986 --> 10:24.823
Oh, no. Look at this.

10:24.823 --> 10:26.658
Do we have enough light
to tape in here?

10:26.658 --> 10:28.160
Yeah, it's good.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.162
I can't believe
they're experimenting...

10:30.162 --> 10:32.765
on endangered species
like these.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.267
This is really strange.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.336
I'm not even sure
if this is legal.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.237
Annie, Annie, look at the bear.

10:44.543 --> 10:45.711
Come on, come on.
What are you waiting for?

10:45.711 --> 10:47.012
Be there in a second, doctor.

10:47.012 --> 10:48.514
Get the other cage.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.482
Get these doors here open.

11:07.466 --> 11:10.903
This is a major piece.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.772
We have got a real story.
This is going to work.

11:13.772 --> 11:14.940
Lori.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.775
What's in here?
Did you see what was in here?

11:16.775 --> 11:18.477
Let's just get out of here.

11:18.477 --> 11:21.969
Here we have a rare, extinct...

11:23.849 --> 11:25.441
dog.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.924
Let me get that for you, doctor.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.660
Take these
and put them in the lab.

11:34.660 --> 11:35.786
Thank you.

11:40.732 --> 11:43.368
What are they
doing to you, huh?

11:43.368 --> 11:44.858
I don't think
you should be doing that.

11:46.171 --> 11:49.174
I want to check him out.
He's not going to do anything.

11:49.174 --> 11:51.343
Hey, what are they doing to you
around here, huh?

11:51.343 --> 11:53.445
Poor little guy.

11:53.445 --> 11:56.815
Don't you look at me.
I didn't put you in there.

11:56.815 --> 12:00.285
You were probably a lawyer
in another life, I bet.

12:00.285 --> 12:03.755
What is this thing
they have on him?

12:03.755 --> 12:07.926
What is this?
What are these wires?

12:07.926 --> 12:09.826
Your rooms are ready.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.566
Wake-up call's at 6:00.

12:14.566 --> 12:17.870
You can check in,
but you can't check out.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.806
- Do you have us both in frame?
- Yeah, why?

12:20.806 --> 12:22.541
I want to do
the intro to the story.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.443
Are you crazy?
We can do that later.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.673
No, it's perfect now. Now.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.487
Do I look OK?

12:35.487 --> 12:37.853
- You look beautiful. Hurry up.
- Dog slobber!

12:44.129 --> 12:45.464
Rolling.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.799
Is this dog
really a noble sacrifice...

12:47.799 --> 12:51.103
donating his life
for the betterment of mankind...

12:51.103 --> 12:53.171
or is he simply
an innocent victim...

12:53.171 --> 12:56.575
of the billion-dollar
vivisection industry?

12:56.575 --> 12:59.444
Shit. Shit. Doggie!

12:59.444 --> 13:01.079
Max! Max!

13:01.079 --> 13:02.546
Get back here.

13:04.616 --> 13:05.851
- Max!
- Where did he go?

13:05.851 --> 13:07.019
Max?

13:07.019 --> 13:09.588
Hey! Hey, hold it right there!

13:09.588 --> 13:12.056
Hey, hold it!
Hold it right there! Stop!

13:18.130 --> 13:19.597
Shit!

13:21.967 --> 13:25.237
- Hurry!
- I'm trying! Go! Go!

13:25.237 --> 13:27.205
- Jesus!
- Shit!

13:27.205 --> 13:29.605
What the hell
are you doing here?

13:32.611 --> 13:34.913
Max.

13:34.913 --> 13:36.403
What's going on?

13:37.449 --> 13:39.284
What are you doing out?

13:39.284 --> 13:41.115
Sit.

13:44.856 --> 13:45.982
Max.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.251
Halt, Max.

13:52.097 --> 13:53.655
Good boy. Good boy.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.971
Max, you're scaring me.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.905
I'm not angry with you.
I'm just tired.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.408
Max...

14:03.408 --> 14:05.544
final command.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.136
Enter.

14:12.150 --> 14:13.674
Enter.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.389
Max...

14:17.389 --> 14:18.515
Max.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.355
Now.

14:26.064 --> 14:27.258
Max!

14:28.333 --> 14:30.135
Max!

14:30.135 --> 14:32.797
God damn it!

14:44.316 --> 14:47.012
- Where's the car?
- Over there.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.134
Come on, come on! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

15:14.546 --> 15:16.214
Just get in!
Just get in the car.

15:16.214 --> 15:17.382
You don't know
what you're doing!

15:17.382 --> 15:19.384
Get in!

15:19.384 --> 15:21.284
Forget the dog!

15:22.888 --> 15:24.913
Max! No!

15:27.225 --> 15:30.429
Oh, man! Oh, man! Sucker!

15:30.429 --> 15:32.898
Max!

15:32.898 --> 15:34.490
No!

15:35.634 --> 15:38.603
Max! Max!

15:40.305 --> 15:42.441
You said they had
a video camera.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.466
Any idea why?

15:46.645 --> 15:48.146
About six months ago...

15:48.146 --> 15:51.149
there was a group
of animal rights fanatics...

15:51.149 --> 15:53.919
protesting outside the lab.

15:53.919 --> 15:55.087
I called the police.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.421
A couple of 'em
tried to break in.

15:56.421 --> 15:57.989
Maybe that's the connection.

15:57.989 --> 15:59.825
Emilio, why don't you see
if we booked anyone?

15:59.825 --> 16:03.556
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
The police did nothing.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.599
Exactly what kind of work
do you do here?

16:07.599 --> 16:09.835
I do genetic research...

16:09.835 --> 16:12.437
often using animal models.

16:12.437 --> 16:14.372
You talking about vivisection?

16:14.372 --> 16:15.874
Yes, I am.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.042
Vivi what?

16:17.042 --> 16:18.643
Vivisection...

16:18.643 --> 16:20.645
those cruel experiments
they do on animals...

16:20.645 --> 16:22.114
to test out new products.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.983
My girlfriend talks about it
all the time.

16:24.983 --> 16:28.687
She wants to make sure
things like the shampoo I use...

16:28.687 --> 16:31.056
are on a cruelty-free
products list.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.691
Well, your girlfriend
is rather ignorant...

16:32.691 --> 16:35.694
like most of these
animal rights people.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.229
You try telling her that.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.664
Look. The kind of research
I do here...

16:39.664 --> 16:43.135
is about saving lives,
human lives.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.137
That's what's important,
isn't it?

16:45.137 --> 16:47.539
I don't make eyeliner here...

16:47.539 --> 16:49.641
and I don't pour acid
into monkeys' eyes...

16:49.641 --> 16:51.309
or stitch them closed, either.

16:51.309 --> 16:54.045
We get the picture, doc.
We'll be in touch.

16:54.045 --> 16:56.148
Yeah.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.983
I want Max back.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.752
We're not talking about
a street mutt here.

17:00.752 --> 17:01.920
We are talking about...

17:01.920 --> 17:03.655
a million-dollar
research animal.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.156
Well, for that kind of money...

17:05.156 --> 17:06.988
he should be able
to find his own way home.

17:10.729 --> 17:10.829
I'm sure not sending him back
there. You saw that dumpster.

17:10.829 --> 17:14.098
I'm sure not sending him back
there. You saw that dumpster.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.902
Yeah, but what are you going
to do with him in the meantime?

17:16.902 --> 17:20.271
I don't know.
Guess I'll take him home.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.107
Find another place for him.

17:22.107 --> 17:23.541
Your boyfriend
is gonna freak out...

17:23.541 --> 17:24.709
when he finds out
where you got him.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.506
Oh, yeah, right. Perry?
Perry won't even notice him.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.347
Give me your purse!
Give it to me!

17:29.347 --> 17:30.515
You, too, bitch!
Gimme the watch!

17:30.515 --> 17:32.250
OK, OK! Let her go.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.352
What else you got?
Come on, what else you got?

17:34.352 --> 17:35.720
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.123
- Oh, God.
- Don't do that!

17:38.123 --> 17:39.558
You got any jewelry?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.958
You want to watch me, mutt?
Woof!

17:44.029 --> 17:45.897
Oh, shit!

17:45.897 --> 17:49.968
Get that mutt away from me!

17:49.968 --> 17:53.238
- Get him! Get him!
- Yeah! Yeah!

17:53.238 --> 17:54.500
Shit!

17:56.208 --> 17:58.877
- Jerk.
- Are you OK?

17:58.877 --> 18:00.367
Son of a bitch.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.084
Look at that.

18:06.084 --> 18:08.143
Oh, God.

18:09.921 --> 18:13.825
Max, how...
What did you do, Max?

18:13.825 --> 18:15.260
Max.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.557
Hey...

18:17.596 --> 18:20.929
My God.
Is this dog incredible or what?

18:46.558 --> 18:47.859
Oh, boy.

18:47.859 --> 18:50.328
Someone's hungry, aren't they?

18:50.328 --> 18:51.496
Yeah.

18:51.496 --> 18:55.000
This stuff smells so disgusting.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.900
Wait till
he goes to the bathroom.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.536
I want to see something.
Would you sit?

19:06.244 --> 19:07.946
Good boy!

19:07.946 --> 19:09.208
Down.

19:13.084 --> 19:15.553
Oh, that's a good boy.

19:15.553 --> 19:17.555
Good boy.

19:17.555 --> 19:19.357
I'm a natural at this.

19:19.357 --> 19:21.326
He's a good boy. Come here.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.329
You just need to have
a little scratch.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.699
OK, get a really good, cute...
Oh, look at that.

19:27.699 --> 19:29.734
Oh, this is great.
This is a great shot.

19:29.734 --> 19:32.704
Oh, my God.
Get a close-up of this.

19:32.704 --> 19:36.508
Look at the size of these scars.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.210
Wait a minute.
Let's see here. Wait.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.838
Somebody's been butchering you,
haven't they?

19:43.848 --> 19:47.052
This is like
in a concentration camp.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.254
You poor dog.

19:49.254 --> 19:52.824
Max, Max, come here, Max.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.160
Max, sit. Sit.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.128
Max, sit.

19:57.128 --> 19:58.563
You're so good.

19:58.563 --> 20:00.532
You're so good, aren't you?

20:00.532 --> 20:03.568
Hey, don't worry. No one's
going to hurt you again.

20:03.568 --> 20:06.271
You protected me.
Now I'm going to protect you.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.397
OK?

20:38.336 --> 20:39.803
Damn truck.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.304
Oh, thank you, Max.

20:49.914 --> 20:52.650
You're sweet.

20:52.650 --> 20:53.844
Turn around.

21:02.894 --> 21:05.630
Baldy, baldy, baldy!

21:05.630 --> 21:08.098
- Aw, screw you.
- Screw you!

21:18.109 --> 21:20.512
Lori?

21:20.512 --> 21:22.414
Hey, Lori!

21:22.414 --> 21:24.349
Come on out. I want to show you
those new menus I got.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.117
Jesus!

21:26.117 --> 21:28.753
Lori, what the hell's
going on in there? You OK?

21:28.753 --> 21:29.988
Max, calm down!

21:29.988 --> 21:33.116
I'll be with you
in a second, honey!

21:38.496 --> 21:40.465
You stay.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.600
What the hell's going on?
What's that dog?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.067
Honey...

21:46.538 --> 21:48.540
Annie and I were attacked
in the parking lot...

21:48.540 --> 21:49.874
at the market tonight.

21:49.874 --> 21:53.578
Jesus. Are you all right?

21:53.578 --> 21:56.114
I'm OK. Just some asshole
with a knife grabbed my purse.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.449
Oh, God.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.584
Did you call the cops?

21:59.584 --> 22:00.885
I didn't have to.

22:00.885 --> 22:04.622
This dog was in the parking lot.

22:04.622 --> 22:07.392
He chased the guy off, and then
he went and got my purse...

22:07.392 --> 22:09.327
and brought it back for me.

22:09.327 --> 22:12.230
Really?

22:12.230 --> 22:13.698
He saved my life.

22:13.698 --> 22:16.734
It was incredible.
You should've seen it.

22:16.734 --> 22:18.536
He's a great guard dog.

22:18.536 --> 22:22.040
No, no, no,
we are not keeping this dog.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.076
That's like
a six-hundred-pound dog, Lori.

22:25.076 --> 22:27.178
If he's that well-trained,
he's got to belong to somebody.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.646
They're gonna want him back.

22:28.646 --> 22:32.016
Maybe. I... I feel a lot safer
with him here...

22:32.016 --> 22:34.018
after what happened to me
tonight.

22:34.018 --> 22:37.021
Lori, you're always
doing this to me, you know?

22:37.021 --> 22:38.189
You're always
bringing something home.

22:38.189 --> 22:41.693
You brought home that parrot,
that foul-mouthed, messy parrot.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.195
And this ugly painting and...

22:44.195 --> 22:45.663
Honey.

22:45.663 --> 22:47.265
It's just... the point is,
you don't ask me about it.

22:47.265 --> 22:49.467
You know? I just come home,
and there's the stuff, right?

22:49.467 --> 22:51.669
If you wanted a dog, you know...

22:51.669 --> 22:52.837
you should have just
told me about it.

22:52.837 --> 22:55.874
We'd go down, and we'd pick out
a nice dog, right?

22:55.874 --> 22:59.377
Don't you think that would be
a better way to do it?

22:59.377 --> 23:01.980
- Yeah, it could be, I guess.
- OK, good.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.982
- But he's already here.
- No, Lori, No.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.417
I... Why? I don't even know
what kind of home...

23:06.417 --> 23:08.920
No dog! No dog!

23:08.920 --> 23:10.088
Just try it with me!

23:10.088 --> 23:12.147
If it doesn't work out,
we'll give him away.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.401
If he stays,
he stays in the backyard.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.596
I don't want him
running around the house loose.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.334
It's cold out there.

23:30.775 --> 23:34.178
Whatever you say, honey.

23:34.178 --> 23:36.112
Thanks for being understanding.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.221
The toughest part
of owning a restaurant...

23:43.221 --> 23:45.655
is picking out the stupid menu.

23:47.091 --> 23:49.193
What do you think of this?

23:49.193 --> 23:50.595
Honey.

23:50.595 --> 23:54.599
Oh, God!
What are you looking at?

23:54.599 --> 23:55.967
That's disgusting.

23:55.967 --> 23:57.535
How can you read that
before you go to bed?

23:57.535 --> 23:58.803
You're going to get nightmares.

23:58.803 --> 24:00.271
- Perry, I'm...
- I don't want you...

24:00.271 --> 24:02.173
to get nightmares, sweetheart.

24:02.173 --> 24:04.642
I want you to sleep real well.

24:04.642 --> 24:07.145
I do. I want you to get
a good night's sleep.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.942
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

24:17.522 --> 24:18.750
Good, hmm?

24:26.264 --> 24:28.700
Honey? I can't...

24:28.700 --> 24:30.969
What? The dog's fine, really.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.136
He's going to bark
the first night.

24:32.136 --> 24:35.173
That's just natural.

24:35.173 --> 24:40.511
I can't... I can't get into this
with him making all that noise.

24:40.511 --> 24:42.313
I have to go check on him.
I'm sorry.

24:42.313 --> 24:43.948
- OK.
- All right?

24:43.948 --> 24:46.017
Fine.
Better go check on him.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.585
He could be hurt or something.

24:47.585 --> 24:52.357
- Who's going to hurt that dog?
- Fine.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.790
Don't be too long, all right?

25:02.600 --> 25:05.103
Ohh, you...

25:05.103 --> 25:07.405
What are you
making so much noise for?

25:07.405 --> 25:11.171
You miss me? You lonely
out there, huh? Huh, boy?

25:13.911 --> 25:16.614
Come here, Max. Max.
Max, come here.

25:16.614 --> 25:18.349
No, you can't go in.
No, you can't go in there.

25:18.349 --> 25:21.477
No, you can't. You can't go in.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.190
Lori!

25:26.190 --> 25:28.420
All right, that's enough.
Out.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.926
Max.

25:38.136 --> 25:39.771
Oh, Max, go to hell, Max.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.705
Get outside. Out.

25:43.441 --> 25:45.534
Oh, give me a break.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.544
You're bad.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.284
OK.

25:53.284 --> 25:56.354
OK, you can stay. OK.

25:56.354 --> 25:57.655
But you have to be
really quiet...

25:57.655 --> 25:59.350
because we don't want
mean old Perry finding out.

26:00.925 --> 26:02.483
OK.

26:04.595 --> 26:08.266
Hey, Lori,
are you coming up or what?

26:08.266 --> 26:09.392
OK.

26:22.613 --> 26:24.080
Honey?

26:32.123 --> 26:33.249
Honey?

26:41.466 --> 26:43.400
Are you asleep?

26:46.404 --> 26:48.806
- So, what took you so long?
- I'm sorry.

26:48.806 --> 26:50.508
- What was the matter with him?
- He's lonely.

26:50.508 --> 26:53.478
Yeah, I know how he feels.

26:53.478 --> 26:55.646
I'm sorry.

26:55.646 --> 26:56.981
OK?

26:56.981 --> 26:59.245
So, what did you do
to shut him up?

27:00.752 --> 27:03.050
You know, I have a way with men.

27:07.825 --> 27:09.383
You're such a liar.

27:19.837 --> 27:22.101
Screw you, mutt!

28:00.711 --> 28:02.508
Is that that dog
outside the door?

28:04.515 --> 28:06.984
You let that dog
in the house, Lori.

28:06.984 --> 28:08.619
I didn...

28:08.619 --> 28:10.688
- He was crying out there.
- How could you do that?

28:10.688 --> 28:12.657
I agreed to let you keep him,
didn't I?

28:12.657 --> 28:14.392
The least you could do...

28:14.392 --> 28:16.661
You got to meet me halfway
on this one, Lori.

28:16.661 --> 28:19.027
OK. OK.

28:21.499 --> 28:24.696
No, Max! No, Max!
No, Max! No, Max! No, Max!

28:26.470 --> 28:28.406
- Get him out!
- Got to go, Max.

28:28.406 --> 28:31.676
Come on, Max. Come on, Max.
We're going now.

28:31.676 --> 28:34.812
Get him out, Lori! Out!

28:34.812 --> 28:36.581
See what you did?
He's upset now.

28:36.581 --> 28:38.412
Get him out, please.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.627
Based on the descriptions
you gave us...

28:49.627 --> 28:50.828
we have several suspects.

28:50.828 --> 28:52.129
All of them have
prior arrests...

28:52.129 --> 28:54.866
for illegal animal rights
activities and so forth.

28:54.866 --> 28:58.169
So, what we want you to do
is take a look...

28:58.169 --> 28:59.337
at a couple
of these pictures here.

28:59.337 --> 29:00.638
Good. Thank you.

29:00.638 --> 29:01.873
Hey, doc, have a seat.

29:01.873 --> 29:03.500
I think we got something
for you here.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.912
Can I have a glass of water?

29:07.912 --> 29:10.073
These are our prime suspects.

29:11.582 --> 29:12.708
Thank you.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.048
I'm not sleeping too good.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.867
Anything?

29:29.867 --> 29:31.266
No.

29:32.570 --> 29:33.696
Take your time.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.575
No. Nothing.

29:44.081 --> 29:45.605
What are we going to do now?

29:46.751 --> 29:49.353
We're dusting for prints. I'm
waiting to hear from the lab.

29:49.353 --> 29:51.856
No good. Came up empty.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.925
You know,
we're on borrowed time, fellas.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.359
All right, doc, look.

29:55.359 --> 29:56.694
You're a little strung out.
You're tired.

29:56.694 --> 29:58.863
Why don't you go home?
We'll round up a few suspects.

29:58.863 --> 30:00.264
This bullshit
is not gonna do anything.

30:00.264 --> 30:04.869
What we gotta do is go
out there and rescue my dog.

30:04.869 --> 30:07.505
We're doing the best we can.

30:07.505 --> 30:10.374
I'll tell you something.

30:10.374 --> 30:13.945
I've given a dangerous
and experimental animal...

30:13.945 --> 30:16.147
a neuropathic drug
to keep him stable...

30:16.147 --> 30:18.950
to keep him calm.

30:18.950 --> 30:23.054
When that drug wears off,
he is going to snap!

30:23.054 --> 30:25.990
Hey, don't do that kind of shit
in here!

30:25.990 --> 30:27.491
We're sitting on a time bomb...

30:27.491 --> 30:30.061
and you're talking about going
out and dusting for prints!

30:30.061 --> 30:31.562
Don't tell us how to do our job.

30:31.562 --> 30:34.565
You don't get it, do you?
Max is fragmenting.

30:34.565 --> 30:36.467
He's coming apart.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.002
If I don't get him tonight...

30:38.002 --> 30:40.905
he's going to go through
a psychotic episode.

30:40.905 --> 30:43.965
You're the only fucking psycho
around here.

30:45.309 --> 30:47.277
Hey, where you going?
We're not done.

30:48.946 --> 30:52.143
We're not talking about
man's best friend here.

31:15.539 --> 31:17.166
Sorry, pooch.

31:39.797 --> 31:40.957
Oh, my God!

31:42.099 --> 31:44.897
I'm sorry, OK? OK? I'm sorry!

31:46.570 --> 31:47.696
Max!

31:48.739 --> 31:51.867
Max! Come here, boy! Breakfast!

32:08.125 --> 32:09.693
Hey, Mr. Ed.

32:09.693 --> 32:13.130
Now, today's word is fartface.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.832
Can you say fartface?

32:14.832 --> 32:17.134
- Fartface. Fartface.
- Very good.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.499
Yes!

32:19.537 --> 32:21.639
- Hey, Lori.
- Rudy, how you doing?

32:21.639 --> 32:24.141
I'm doing fine, but I'm
starving. What are you making?

32:24.141 --> 32:27.378
Fruit and yogurt. Want some?

32:27.378 --> 32:29.680
No, thanks. I'm allergic.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.415
Well, go ahead.
Look in the fridge.

32:31.415 --> 32:35.152
There's carrot sticks and
apples, some celery juice...

32:35.152 --> 32:38.556
- Cool! Pizza!
- Some pizza.

32:38.556 --> 32:41.525
- It's been in there a week.
- Yeah, just like at home.

32:46.497 --> 32:47.623
Who's that?

32:49.100 --> 32:52.870
- Wow! When did you get the dog?
- Yesterday.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.372
Oh, man. This guy's
even bigger than my collie.

32:55.372 --> 32:57.441
- What's his name?
- Max.

32:57.441 --> 33:00.644
Hey, Max, want to come in?
Come on in.

33:00.644 --> 33:03.581
Hey, don't let him get my pizza.

33:03.581 --> 33:06.484
Come here. Come here.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.285
He's not allowed in the house.

33:08.285 --> 33:10.354
Can I bring him over
to my house to meet Heidi?

33:10.354 --> 33:12.490
- Does that sound like fun?
- He's so cute.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.492
All right. Hand me his leash.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.983
All right. There you go.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.132
- Keep your eye on him.
- I will. I will.

33:21.132 --> 33:24.502
Be careful.
Bring him back in one piece.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.571
- You don't trust me?
- No.

33:27.571 --> 33:29.473
Rudy, close the gate
when you bring him back.

33:29.473 --> 33:30.599
- OK?
- OK.

33:36.847 --> 33:38.382
Oh, hi, doggie.

33:38.382 --> 33:40.484
You want to help me
fix this thing?

33:40.484 --> 33:44.614
You could go over and get that
brake line if you wanted to.

33:48.759 --> 33:51.523
Whoa. Good boy, Max.

33:58.669 --> 34:01.137
Hey, Heidi. Say hello to Max.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.605
You like her, huh?

34:11.614 --> 34:14.351
M-M-Max. Max!

34:14.351 --> 34:15.953
Max! Shh!

34:15.953 --> 34:17.284
You're going to wake up my dad!

34:18.621 --> 34:20.056
Shut up, Max! Quiet!

34:20.056 --> 34:22.726
Rudy, what the hell's
going on out here?

34:22.726 --> 34:25.129
You know
I've been working all night.

34:25.129 --> 34:28.132
It's nothing, dad. Max just
wanted to play with Heidi.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.362
Doesn't want to play
with him, OK?

34:31.635 --> 34:34.271
Now get him out of here
so I can get some rest.

34:34.271 --> 34:35.973
OK.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.600
Come on, Heidi.

34:40.710 --> 34:42.735
Come on, Max. Let's go see Chet.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.788
All right! Good noose.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.847
Worthy of the SPCA.

34:54.491 --> 34:56.822
Don't mess with the pros,
hairball.

34:58.729 --> 35:01.789
Hey, chill, fleabag,
or I'll stun gun your bun.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.093
We got him.

35:08.205 --> 35:09.773
What do you think you're doing?

35:09.773 --> 35:11.008
I wasn't gonna light it.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.010
Go ahead. Kill yourself.

35:13.010 --> 35:14.445
At your age and weight...

35:14.445 --> 35:16.180
you're a perfect candidate
for a heart attack.

35:16.180 --> 35:19.172
- I'm trying to quit, aren't I?
- Exactly.

35:20.651 --> 35:23.087
I'm gonna put you
on a real fitness program.

35:23.087 --> 35:25.055
You're worse than my wife.

35:25.055 --> 35:27.324
In six months,
you won't recognize yourself.

35:27.324 --> 35:29.126
Yeah, 'cause I'll be dead.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.262
- What's this crap?
- Missing persons.

35:31.262 --> 35:34.365
Gets a call from a guy
named Bill Sanders.

35:34.365 --> 35:37.368
His wife Judy
doesn't come home last night.

35:37.368 --> 35:38.767
Guess where she works?

35:40.504 --> 35:42.139
Emax.

35:42.139 --> 35:44.174
You're shitting me.

35:44.174 --> 35:46.477
Pulled a photo off the computer.
Take a look.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.713
Maybe we'd better have another
visit with the good doctor.

35:49.713 --> 35:54.151
Judy Sanders only worked for me
for about three months.

35:54.151 --> 35:56.153
I didn't really know her
very well.

35:56.153 --> 35:58.656
Her husband says she left
for work that morning.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.958
Well, she never arrived.
That's all I know.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.360
What about my dog?

36:03.360 --> 36:04.628
Any leads?

36:04.628 --> 36:07.064
Keep your shirt on, doc.
We're on top of it.

36:07.064 --> 36:09.099
We already fed the description
into the computer.

36:09.099 --> 36:12.227
All units have been alerted,
including animal control.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.739
I have to show you something.

36:20.110 --> 36:22.046
Friday,
bring up the promo material.

36:22.046 --> 36:23.809
One moment, please.

36:25.616 --> 36:27.518
Voice activation.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.120
You know,
when you think of guard dogs...

36:30.120 --> 36:32.623
you usually think
of German shepherd.

36:32.623 --> 36:36.593
They're loyal, smart, lethal,
but not good enough.

36:36.593 --> 36:39.063
And now, with the development
of the Emax-3000...

36:39.063 --> 36:42.533
they're totally obsolete.

36:42.533 --> 36:47.171
You see, Max, as I call him,
is not your typical dog.

36:47.171 --> 36:49.006
He's a genetic crossbreed.

36:49.006 --> 36:50.441
A mutt.

36:50.441 --> 36:53.577
I don't mean a mutt, sir.
Look around you.

36:53.577 --> 36:56.146
Each of these animals
is endowed...

36:56.146 --> 36:58.048
with a specific
desirable trait...

36:58.048 --> 37:01.108
that is dedicated
to their survival.

37:02.586 --> 37:05.289
If you took the DNA from each...

37:05.289 --> 37:06.690
and genetically spliced it...

37:06.690 --> 37:09.460
into the DNA
of a breed of a dog...

37:09.460 --> 37:11.362
you would have
a magnificent creature.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.597
You've actually been able
to do this?

37:13.597 --> 37:16.033
Enhance sight, hearing...

37:16.033 --> 37:20.604
strength, speed, stamina...

37:20.604 --> 37:23.334
the ability to climb
with jaguarlike agility...

37:24.808 --> 37:26.610
even a chameleonlike
capability...

37:26.610 --> 37:29.880
to camouflage itself
if threatened.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.483
Each of these traits
have been bred into Max.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.752
His intelligence
is so advanced...

37:34.752 --> 37:36.787
that he can operate
as a stand-alone unit...

37:36.787 --> 37:38.455
without a human handler.

37:38.455 --> 37:42.259
He can comprehend
almost 350 spoken commands.

37:42.259 --> 37:44.328
Is that in English
or in Spanish?

37:44.328 --> 37:47.164
You take your pick, detective.

37:47.164 --> 37:50.401
What I am trying to tell you...

37:50.401 --> 37:54.138
is that in the right hands,
Max can save thousands of lives.

37:54.138 --> 37:58.809
In the wrong hands,
he can be a deadly weapon.

37:58.809 --> 37:59.076
Boy, did my brother
cut one this morning.

37:59.076 --> 38:02.246
Boy, did my brother
cut one this morning.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.448
Grossed me right out
of the kitchen.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.650
Sounds like it was
nuclear winter in there.

38:06.650 --> 38:07.776
Ka-boom!

38:16.593 --> 38:20.097
Look. There's Mrs. Barclay's
stupid cat Boo.

38:20.097 --> 38:22.633
I hate that dumb cat.
He always tries to scratch me.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.759
Me, too.

38:30.007 --> 38:33.444
- Get him, Max!
- Sic 'im! Come on!

38:33.444 --> 38:36.880
Go! Go, Max! Go! Get him!

38:36.880 --> 38:40.217
Come on, Max! Get him!

38:40.217 --> 38:42.186
Kick his ass! Come on!

38:42.186 --> 38:44.814
- Yeah, get him!
- Come on!

38:47.157 --> 38:48.818
Come on!

39:04.074 --> 39:05.507
Wow.

39:38.108 --> 39:40.511
You sicked him on that cat,
not me.

39:40.511 --> 39:41.808
Oh, no, no, no. You did.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.582
We better get out of here.
Mrs. Barclay will kill us!

39:45.582 --> 39:47.384
Forget about it! We just got
to get out of here...

39:47.384 --> 39:48.986
before he gets us, too!

39:48.986 --> 39:50.821
- Oh, man!
- I told you not to!

39:50.821 --> 39:53.123
- Shut up!
- That was your fault!

39:53.123 --> 39:56.024
Shut up! Shut up!

39:58.595 --> 40:00.631
- It's the brake lines.
- You're kidding.

40:00.631 --> 40:02.132
Yeah, like, two hundred bucks.

40:02.132 --> 40:05.402
- You got the checkbook?
- Yeah.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.471
You got it on you?

40:07.471 --> 40:08.597
Maybe.

40:10.140 --> 40:11.642
Hey, listen...

40:11.642 --> 40:15.412
why don't we finish
what we started last night, huh?

40:15.412 --> 40:17.607
Because
I'm already late for work.

40:19.149 --> 40:20.275
Come here.

40:26.156 --> 40:27.658
Curtains are open.

40:27.658 --> 40:29.250
So what? Nobody's watching.

41:07.531 --> 41:10.193
Well, come around, idiot.

41:11.568 --> 41:12.694
Come around!

41:17.307 --> 41:19.275
You stupid mutt!

41:20.844 --> 41:22.744
Put a lid on that dog, huh?

41:27.117 --> 41:28.812
Hey, stop!

41:39.663 --> 41:41.688
You stupid mutt!

41:45.936 --> 41:48.171
No, no, no, Max.

41:48.171 --> 41:50.073
Come on.

41:50.073 --> 41:53.176
You have to...
Max, you have to stay. Max.

41:53.176 --> 41:55.178
Go on. You have to stay.

41:55.178 --> 41:57.180
Good boy.
I'll be back in a little while.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.182
I just have to go to work.
It's OK.

41:59.182 --> 42:01.150
I have a deadline to meet.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.085
Max.

42:12.329 --> 42:15.065
Don't do this to me, Max.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.067
You stay.

42:17.067 --> 42:19.763
Do what dogs do...
guard the house. You know.

42:41.792 --> 42:42.959
Come on, we got to go.

42:42.959 --> 42:45.062
- Dad...
- I don't want to be late.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.596
Come on.

42:46.596 --> 42:48.962
Come on, Heidi. You have
to stay at home. Come on.

42:52.169 --> 42:55.038
You don't want to miss the game,
do you?

42:55.038 --> 42:57.541
OK, I'm coming.

42:57.541 --> 42:58.675
You locked the front door,
didn't you?

42:58.675 --> 43:01.411
- You think I'd forget?
- All right.

43:01.411 --> 43:02.537
Let's go.

43:58.135 --> 44:01.671
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

44:01.671 --> 44:03.571
Come here, boo!

44:11.014 --> 44:12.849
Let's get to work.

44:12.849 --> 44:14.384
See how this tape turned out.

44:14.384 --> 44:17.120
I need a cappuccino.
You want one?

44:17.120 --> 44:19.623
Can we just get into this,
please?

44:19.623 --> 44:21.825
So, how was Max last night?

44:21.825 --> 44:24.628
He was a pain in the ass...

44:24.628 --> 44:27.464
but he's got such a personality.

44:27.464 --> 44:30.567
- How did Perry handle it?
- Oh, he loves Max.

44:30.567 --> 44:33.537
Right. You didn't tell him
where you got that dog, did you?

44:33.537 --> 44:34.663
He'll see it on the news.

44:37.707 --> 44:41.411
I think something's gnawed
through your brake line somehow.

44:41.411 --> 44:45.148
I had my brake lines changed
just this morning.

44:45.148 --> 44:47.116
See for yourself, huh?

44:51.154 --> 44:52.621
Oh, Jesus.

44:55.458 --> 44:57.894
Oh, God.
He's trying to kill me.

44:57.894 --> 45:01.193
- Who's trying to kill you?
- My girlfriend's dog.

45:02.599 --> 45:04.601
Yeah, right.

45:04.601 --> 45:06.068
I like that.

45:36.900 --> 45:39.402
- Yo, Frank, over here.
- What do we got, Dan?

45:39.402 --> 45:41.371
One of the box boys found
a body behind the dumpster.

45:41.371 --> 45:43.640
It's pretty bad.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.141
Fits the description
of the mugger...

45:45.141 --> 45:46.643
that's been terrorizing
the mall.

45:46.643 --> 45:49.246
Jesus Christ!

45:49.246 --> 45:52.147
Get ahold of Jarret.
I want him to look at this.

45:54.651 --> 45:57.279
You won't be mugging
anybody no more, pal.

45:58.488 --> 46:03.593
The lacerations, the power,
the efficiency...

46:03.593 --> 46:05.462
yes, it was Max.

46:05.462 --> 46:07.597
Put this bastard
out of business.

46:07.597 --> 46:08.832
Put him out of business?

46:08.832 --> 46:10.267
He killed him,
for Christ's sake.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.903
That's what
he was designed to do, sir.

46:12.903 --> 46:14.604
What is the matter, detective?

46:14.604 --> 46:17.140
You upset that Max
did your job for you?

46:17.140 --> 46:19.376
- Want to see me do my job?
- Yeah, do your job.

46:19.376 --> 46:21.945
I'll do my job, all right.
Emilio, get on the blower...

46:21.945 --> 46:23.647
and tell every black and white
in San Remo...

46:23.647 --> 46:26.182
that if they find
this... this canine...

46:26.182 --> 46:28.985
to blow its friggin' head off!

46:28.985 --> 46:32.122
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, detective.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.491
I don't think this city
could survive...

46:34.491 --> 46:37.861
a multimillion dollar lawsuit
'cause you went off half-cocked.

46:37.861 --> 46:41.298
Half-cocked? Somebody died here.

46:41.298 --> 46:45.101
This was a predator
who preyed on innocent people.

46:45.101 --> 46:48.204
People have to cower
in their homes...

46:48.204 --> 46:50.140
because you two are
standing around bullshitting.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.675
Eat shit.

46:51.675 --> 46:54.610
Max doesn't deserve a bullet.
He deserves a medal.

46:57.681 --> 47:01.518
Friday, what is the maximum
amount of time left...

47:01.518 --> 47:04.087
before Max becomes
completely destabilized?

47:04.087 --> 47:06.055
One moment, please.

47:10.360 --> 47:14.597
5 hours, 29 minutes,
and 14 seconds.

47:14.597 --> 47:16.199
And the minimum?

47:16.199 --> 47:19.134
The minimum time
has already expired.

47:40.223 --> 47:41.992
Hi there, buddy.

47:41.992 --> 47:44.527
Hey, big fella.

47:44.527 --> 47:48.331
Easy now, boy. Easy, easy.

47:48.331 --> 47:52.836
Take it easy now.
Don't be stupid.

47:52.836 --> 47:54.571
You must be new
in the neighborhood.

47:54.571 --> 47:56.334
I think it's time we met.

47:59.342 --> 48:01.640
Try something,
you son of a bitch.

49:21.357 --> 49:22.483
Dr. Jarret?

49:23.593 --> 49:25.060
I found something.

49:36.639 --> 49:38.800
Hey, Glen, you got
any blank tape I can steal?

49:46.449 --> 49:48.618
- Hurry.
- I'm trying.

49:48.618 --> 49:49.744
Go!

49:51.121 --> 49:52.288
Jesus!

49:52.288 --> 49:55.225
- We're in big trouble.
- Why?

49:55.225 --> 49:58.161
I just saw Dr. Jarret out front.

49:58.161 --> 50:00.897
Hi, Lori. This is Deborah
at the front desk.

50:00.897 --> 50:03.331
Yeah. I've got a Dr. Jarret
here to see you.

50:08.638 --> 50:09.764
Sure.

50:11.841 --> 50:14.332
I'm sorry, sir. Miss Tanner's
not available right now.

50:15.678 --> 50:18.248
Hey, look,
it's urgent that I talk to her.

50:18.248 --> 50:20.273
Sir, please step outside.

50:21.651 --> 50:23.153
Where are you going?

50:23.153 --> 50:25.655
I just... I got to do something
with Max.

50:25.655 --> 50:27.023
What are you gonna do with him?

50:27.023 --> 50:29.826
I don't know! Hide him.
Put him in a kennel somewhere.

50:29.826 --> 50:32.662
Lori, that's probably the first
place he'll go looking for him.

50:32.662 --> 50:35.098
You just have to give him away
to somebody.

50:35.098 --> 50:38.101
- Who?
- I don't know. Check the paper.

50:38.101 --> 50:40.968
There's got to be somebody
looking for a great guard dog.

50:45.675 --> 50:47.677
Sir, please leave the building
peacefully...

50:47.677 --> 50:49.245
or I'm going to have
to call security.

50:49.245 --> 50:50.780
What?

50:50.780 --> 50:52.248
- Don't make me do this.
- Wait a second.

50:52.248 --> 50:53.716
- Come on, listen.
- Don't do that.

50:53.716 --> 50:54.884
Please, sir, leave the building.

50:54.884 --> 50:56.386
She is not available
to talk to you right now.

50:56.386 --> 50:58.855
- Call her back...
- Ray!

50:58.855 --> 51:00.982
Excuse me, sir. You're going
to have to step outside.

51:07.096 --> 51:08.631
Get the hell out of here.

51:08.631 --> 51:11.828
- Come on, let's go, let's go.
- OK, OK.

51:11.868 --> 51:12.994
Jerk.

51:39.162 --> 51:40.424
Hey, Lori!

52:18.534 --> 52:19.728
Hello, fartface!

52:37.153 --> 52:38.279
Max?

52:41.157 --> 52:43.092
Oh, Max!

52:43.092 --> 52:45.295
I got something for you, Max.

52:45.295 --> 52:46.626
Lunchtime!

52:48.197 --> 52:51.768
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

52:51.768 --> 52:54.170
Look what I got for you, huh?
Look at that.

52:54.170 --> 52:56.973
Some nice steak tartare
from the restaurant.

52:56.973 --> 52:59.709
It's all for you, buddy, OK?
Good boy.

52:59.709 --> 53:02.178
Go ahead. Eat up, boy.
That's it.

53:02.178 --> 53:05.238
I made that special for you,
all right?

53:08.751 --> 53:10.787
Go on, Max. Eat up, buddy.

53:10.787 --> 53:12.652
It's good. Yum yum yum.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.816
Eat the food, Max.

53:49.225 --> 53:51.523
Hey, fleabag! Muttonhead!

54:15.318 --> 54:16.546
Max!

54:19.722 --> 54:21.224
Max.

54:21.224 --> 54:23.025
Hi, Max.

54:23.025 --> 54:24.794
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.

54:24.794 --> 54:26.462
We got to go for a ride.
That's a good boy.

54:26.462 --> 54:29.363
Come on. Come on.
Good boy. Come on.

54:31.834 --> 54:33.392
Oh, good boy.

54:34.670 --> 54:37.407
OK, stop stuffing your face
for one minute.

54:37.407 --> 54:39.809
I got news.

54:39.809 --> 54:43.413
I think Dr. Jarret's psychotic
superdog killed Judy Sanders...

54:43.413 --> 54:45.314
the girl who disappeared
from Emax.

54:45.314 --> 54:46.482
Check this out.

54:46.482 --> 54:50.486
He got his Ph.D. From Berkeley
at twenty.

54:50.486 --> 54:52.455
By the time
he was twenty-eight...

54:52.455 --> 54:54.991
he was patenting
this new synthetic hormone.

54:54.991 --> 54:57.093
Made him a multimillionaire
overnight.

54:57.093 --> 54:59.629
All right, he's got
a wonderful résumé. What else?

54:59.629 --> 55:02.365
Here's where the story
gets interesting.

55:02.365 --> 55:04.467
About six years ago,
Jarret gets busted...

55:04.467 --> 55:07.036
experimenting
on endangered species.

55:07.036 --> 55:08.838
His investors pulled out...

55:08.838 --> 55:10.673
and he's rejected
by the scientific community.

55:10.673 --> 55:12.942
He has a nervous breakdown.

55:12.942 --> 55:14.110
About a year later...

55:14.110 --> 55:17.847
he gets out of the hospital,
takes Emax private...

55:17.847 --> 55:20.616
and starts breeding
these friggin' guard dogs.

55:20.616 --> 55:24.320
He's got everything he has
riding on their success.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.689
He'd do anything
to protect that animal.

55:26.689 --> 55:29.692
I say we get a warrant,
go to Emax.

55:29.692 --> 55:32.562
I bet we find the body.

55:32.562 --> 55:34.689
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

56:29.051 --> 56:30.887
- See the scars?
- Yeah.

56:30.887 --> 56:33.685
Get them.
Go all the way up and down.

56:37.860 --> 56:40.263
- Do you have us both in frame?
- Yeah. Why?

56:40.263 --> 56:42.632
I want to do
the intro to the story.

56:42.632 --> 56:44.400
Are you crazy?
We can do that later.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.136
No. It's perfect. Now, now.

56:47.136 --> 56:48.971
Do I look OK?

56:48.971 --> 56:50.172
You look beautiful. Just hurry.

56:50.172 --> 56:51.969
Dog slobber.

57:04.086 --> 57:06.622
- Lori?
- Ray?

57:06.622 --> 57:08.524
Come here, boy.

57:08.524 --> 57:11.561
Come on,
I'm not going to hurt you.

57:11.561 --> 57:13.996
How are we going
to become friends...

57:13.996 --> 57:15.164
if you're going
to act like that?

57:15.164 --> 57:18.801
I've got a nice piece
of rawhide for you.

57:18.801 --> 57:21.003
You know you want that.

57:21.003 --> 57:23.839
Come get it. Come get it.

57:23.839 --> 57:25.508
You're a big dog.

57:25.508 --> 57:27.743
Handsome, too, aren't you?

57:27.743 --> 57:30.613
I bet you get
all the girls. Huh?

57:30.613 --> 57:32.706
Hey, you want some more?

57:36.586 --> 57:39.622
Boy, I sure would like
to have him around.

57:39.622 --> 57:42.625
So, where would Max live,
exactly?

57:42.625 --> 57:45.995
Well, not here, that's for sure.

57:45.995 --> 57:47.597
OK.

57:47.597 --> 57:51.801
No, I got a big ranch of about
15 acres out in Shadow Hills.

57:51.801 --> 57:54.003
My dog Wayne
used to love it out there.

57:54.003 --> 57:55.504
That sounds great.

57:55.504 --> 57:57.907
There's plenty of room
to run around in...

57:57.907 --> 58:00.774
rabbits to chase,
creeks to swim in.

58:02.545 --> 58:05.715
Dog's got a good life
if he's with me.

58:05.715 --> 58:08.479
I need to know I can have him
back if things change.

58:09.752 --> 58:11.420
This isn't easy.

58:11.420 --> 58:12.888
Oh, he'll be all right.

58:12.888 --> 58:15.091
Just give him a couple of days
up at the ranch...

58:15.091 --> 58:16.388
he won't even remember you.

58:23.532 --> 58:25.935
I'm sorry, Max.

58:25.935 --> 58:27.236
I have to do this.

58:27.236 --> 58:29.170
Otherwise, they're going
to take you back to the lab.

58:30.973 --> 58:34.875
Remember I promised
I would take care of you? Huh?

58:38.414 --> 58:39.849
Besides,
Ray's going to look after you.

58:39.849 --> 58:43.819
- Isn't that right, Ray?
- That sure is right.

58:43.819 --> 58:45.488
We're gonna have
a great time together.

58:45.488 --> 58:47.012
Aren't we, Max?

58:48.724 --> 58:50.885
OK, Max, you be good.

58:53.763 --> 58:56.065
Stay with Ray now, OK?

58:56.065 --> 58:57.589
I'll be back for you.

58:59.168 --> 59:00.931
You'll be fine, boy.

59:03.539 --> 59:05.439
Easy, boy, easy.

59:12.782 --> 59:14.477
That's enough of that.

59:20.022 --> 59:22.625
Settle down, boy.

59:22.625 --> 59:25.924
She dumped you,
just like they all do.

59:30.199 --> 59:33.636
I said settle down,
you worthless piece of dog shit.

59:33.636 --> 59:36.503
I asked you nice, didn't I?

59:40.743 --> 59:42.645
- Hello.
- Lori?

59:42.645 --> 59:44.847
Look, I don't know if you're
gonna believe this or not...

59:44.847 --> 59:46.882
but I think your dog
tried to kill me today.

59:46.882 --> 59:48.384
What are you talking about?

59:48.384 --> 59:51.253
Well, he gnawed
through my brake lines...

59:51.253 --> 59:53.589
and I almost crashed
going down the highway.

59:53.589 --> 59:55.124
That's crazy, Perry.

59:55.124 --> 59:57.927
Oh, I know it's crazy, but
I swear to God it's true, Lori.

59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.596
And then when I finally
got home, he attacked me.

01:00:00.596 --> 01:00:02.098
The dog's got to go.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:04.633
- He's gone, OK?
- What?

01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:07.363
- I just gave him away.
- Lor-Lori...

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:30.620
What's the matter, boy?
Don't you like my ranch?

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.363
Living
at the end of that chain...

01:00:34.363 --> 01:00:36.558
is gonna make you the meanest
junkyard dog in the city.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.701
Shut up!

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.270
You going to shut up or not?

01:01:00.122 --> 01:01:02.558
OK, you asked for it.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.727
Now you're going to get it.

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:07.897
Come on, boy. Come on, Max.

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:11.400
Come on, Max. Now you're
going to be a hot dog.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.927
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
I'm going to burn your ass bad.

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:21.974
Get off me! Get...

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:44.166
Look, I'm telling you...

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:46.869
Dr. Jarret just ran out
a little while ago.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:49.438
I mean, he told us
to pack everything up.

01:01:49.438 --> 01:01:53.275
I'm sure when Dr. Jarret gets
back, he'll explain everything.

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:55.277
Do you know a woman
named Judy Sanders...

01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:57.346
one of the ladies
who used to work here?

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.514
Not really.

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:01.550
I mean, I said hello to her
a couple times in the hallway.

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:02.718
Why?

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:06.288
We think Judy is dead,
and Dr. Jarret is responsible.

01:02:06.288 --> 01:02:07.890
What?

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.687
Tell us where he went.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.195
Yeah, I think we got it, Doug.

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:15.064
All right. That's good.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.499
You know, I'd like to take
about a five-minute break.

01:02:17.499 --> 01:02:18.625
Yeah, that's good.

01:02:20.769 --> 01:02:23.172
Hey, pan down the row.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.807
Remember me?

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:27.176
Where's my dog?

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.612
Hey, man, it wasn't my idea.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.180
You got to talk to Lori.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.579
Where's Lori?

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:13.721
Max?

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:22.730
Oh, my God.

01:03:25.634 --> 01:03:27.937
Where did you come from?

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.306
I got him for you.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.473
Do you like him?

01:03:31.473 --> 01:03:33.566
What? I...

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:37.279
I can't believe you did this.

01:03:37.279 --> 01:03:39.648
Yeah. I know.
Me, neither, really.

01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:41.884
But I was feeling kind of bad...

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:44.148
you know, 'cause I know
how much you miss Max.

01:03:45.587 --> 01:03:46.989
And also I figured
now was my chance...

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.358
to get a dog in here
that I liked, too...

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:53.429
before you brought home
another monster.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:56.031
- He's cute.
- Mm-hmm. What is he?

01:03:56.031 --> 01:03:58.000
I don't know.
The lady at the pet shop...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.302
she swore to me he wasn't gonna
get much bigger than this.

01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:03.505
So he's a little dog.
That's what he is.

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:07.142
Looks like
he should be a Barney or...

01:04:07.142 --> 01:04:09.345
No. Spike.
I've been calling him Spike.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.646
- He likes it.
- Spike?

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.081
Yeah. He acts like a Spike.
Watch this.

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.449
This is his favorite thing,
this plug.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.850
Go get it, Spike. Go get it.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.619
Honey, that's not... that's not...
that's dangerous.

01:04:17.619 --> 01:04:19.488
OK.

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.723
It's very sweet of you.

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:22.391
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:25.690
- I love you, Lori.
- I know.

01:04:29.064 --> 01:04:31.400
Thanks for getting rid of Max
for me, honey.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.336
I really didn't like him
very much.

01:04:34.336 --> 01:04:37.305
I got to go to work, honey.
I'm late.

01:05:10.372 --> 01:05:12.875
Spike. No, no.

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:14.643
Don't play with that.

01:05:14.643 --> 01:05:16.812
- Lori?
- Rudy.

01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.677
Meet Spike.

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:39.601
Where's Max?

01:05:39.601 --> 01:05:42.866
Uh, Max's owner
decided to take him back.

01:05:43.972 --> 01:05:45.140
You're lucky.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.076
What do you mean?

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.510
Uh, nothing.

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:50.603
I'm going to make
a milk shake, OK?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.787
Voilà. Stir.

01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:18.874
Um, look, just take it easy,
OK, Max? Just take it easy.

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:22.678
Max. Look, everything's OK,
buddy. Take it easy now.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:25.581
Look, you went after me first,
Max, and I went after you...

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.550
so we can just call it even
then, OK? And we can be friends.

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:31.383
Max. Max.

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:08.312
Oh, damn.

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:13.028
Perry!

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:15.155
Oh, God. Max.

01:07:22.237 --> 01:07:23.966
Max, no! No!

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.113
Oh. Rudy, Rudy.

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:33.274
- Open up! Let us in!
- Max!

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.017
- Freeze!
- There he is!

01:07:37.719 --> 01:07:39.152
Stay down!

01:07:51.533 --> 01:07:52.966
Let's go! Let's get this mutt!

01:07:59.174 --> 01:08:01.643
Right over there.
Come on. Come on.

01:08:01.643 --> 01:08:03.378
Let's go, Emilio!

01:08:03.378 --> 01:08:05.948
Get in there, you wimp.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:09.017
All units, all units.
We have a 1091-A.

01:08:09.017 --> 01:08:10.252
Vicious dog,
pursuit in progress.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.420
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.855
We got to get in on this.

01:08:13.855 --> 01:08:16.380
Any available units,
please respond.

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.395
Come on, let's go! Floor it!

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.912
He's turning right
on Albuquerque. Adam 361.

01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:40.015
Split off.
We'll try to box him in.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.413
You got it. We're in pursuit.

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:46.255
He's turning on Montecito!
Don't lose him!

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.856
Rank amateurs.

01:08:47.856 --> 01:08:49.255
Uh, roger that.

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:59.490
Close in on him! Now!

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.595
We got him, we got him.

01:09:04.805 --> 01:09:06.238
Ram him! Run him over!

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.818
He's ours now.

01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:19.218
Move over, rover,
so the pros can take over.

01:09:34.536 --> 01:09:36.071
You ready for some action?

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:38.206
Cocked and loaded,
armed and dangerous, baby.

01:09:38.206 --> 01:09:41.334
All right, let's bag this puppy.

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:51.077
I've got a weird feeling
about this.

01:09:54.589 --> 01:09:55.715
Come on, man.

01:09:58.093 --> 01:09:59.928
Here, puppy.

01:09:59.928 --> 01:10:01.190
Good doggy.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.158
Here, puppy.

01:10:24.686 --> 01:10:27.389
- Go! Go! Go!
- I'm going! I'm going! OK!

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:28.549
What was that?

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:43.605
What's going on?

01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:45.674
- Stay back, folks.
- You folks stay back.

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.642
Stay clear of the area, please.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.981
OK, ma'am, to the side.
Just stay back there, please.

01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:56.952
I heard there was some kind of
wild animal that got in there.

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.216
OK, people, let's go home.
Show's over.

01:11:02.624 --> 01:11:04.524
They tell me
he's going to be OK.

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:08.558
We'd like to ask you
some questions inside.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:21.036
I'll be in here, Emilio.

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:25.313
Where do you think
you're going?

01:11:25.313 --> 01:11:27.983
There's nothing you can do
for your boyfriend now.

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:29.985
I have to go to the hospital
to be with Perry.

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:32.320
Hey, the way I look at it,
you only got two choices.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.589
One... you walk out that door,
and we arrest you.

01:11:34.589 --> 01:11:36.358
Two... you stay here
and help us catch...

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.427
this friggin' psycho mutt.

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:40.762
'Cause I got a hunch
he's coming back here.

01:11:40.762 --> 01:11:43.765
I'll do whatever I can to help.
I'm sorry.

01:11:43.765 --> 01:11:45.634
All right, all right, all right.
Sit tight.

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.124
We'll take care of everything.

01:12:07.055 --> 01:12:10.325
It's, uh...
all clear out here, Frankie.

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:13.328
OK, Emilio. Let me know
if you see anything.

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.488
10-4.

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:20.624
- We'll call you if we need you.
- OK.

01:12:28.743 --> 01:12:31.713
It's going to be OK, Spike.

01:12:31.713 --> 01:12:33.704
Everything's
going to be all right.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.439
Get in!

01:15:35.897 --> 01:15:37.365
Let me out!

01:15:37.365 --> 01:15:40.168
I just need you long enough
to get Max to follow us to Emax.

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:42.671
- Then you can go to hell.
- Stop the car!

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.439
Stop it!

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:46.873
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:53.748
Why didn't you leave me alone?

01:15:53.748 --> 01:15:55.050
What about those animals
at your lab?

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.451
What about
what you're doing to them?

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:59.287
They mean nothing.
The project is what's important.

01:15:59.287 --> 01:16:00.755
Don't you understand that?

01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:02.857
- No. I can't.
- Gimme that.

01:16:02.857 --> 01:16:06.594
You broke the bond with Max.

01:16:06.594 --> 01:16:09.028
If I don't sedate him,
he's going to turn on you...

01:16:09.931 --> 01:16:11.626
just like he did on me.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.062
Max! Max!

01:16:41.062 --> 01:16:44.733
Release! Max! Release!

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.501
Release!

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:48.162
Max!

01:17:56.404 --> 01:17:58.531
Spike, come here.

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.383
No!

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:09.984
Get out.

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:11.315
He'll kill you.

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:20.119
Max.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:43.946
Spike!

01:21:01.155 --> 01:21:03.248
Max.

01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:39.187
Get away from my dog.

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:49.960
Get away from him!

01:21:51.572 --> 01:21:53.164
No!

01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:01.175
Lori! Come here! You got
to come see this! Come on!

01:23:01.175 --> 01:23:03.544
OK. Come on, Spike.

01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:04.779
Let's say hi to Rudy.

01:23:04.779 --> 01:23:06.080
Come on.

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.281
You won't believe this.
Come on.

01:23:07.281 --> 01:23:09.383
What?

01:23:09.383 --> 01:23:10.885
Surprise.

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:13.888
Oh, no! Look at them!

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:17.625
- Aren't they cute?
- Oh, come here.

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.894
Hey, you want one?
You want one?

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:22.454
Oh, look. Spike's jealous.
