00:49.500 --> 00:51.418
<i>For centuries,
the order of the Knights Templar</i>

00:51.502 --> 00:53.379
<i>have searched for the
mythical Apple of Eden.</i>

00:53.379 --> 00:55.297
<i>They believe it
contains not only</i>

00:55.339 --> 00:57.550
<i>the seeds of man's
first disobedience,</i>

00:57.550 --> 01:00.970
<i>but the key to the
free will itself.</i>

01:01.095 --> 01:04.473
<i>If they find the relic
and decode its secrets,</i>

01:04.473 --> 01:07.351
<i>they will have the power to
control all freedom of thought.</i>

01:07.393 --> 01:10.563
<i>Only the brotherhood called the
Assassins stands in their way...</i>

01:20.322 --> 01:23.909
<i>ANDALUCIA, SPAIN
1492</i>

01:56.275 --> 01:59.862
The Inquisition has finally
delivered Spain to the Templars.

02:00.738 --> 02:05.075
Sultan Muhammad and his
people still hold out in Granada.

02:05.409 --> 02:07.536
But if his son,
the prince, is captured,

02:08.537 --> 02:10.622
he will surrender the city
and the Apple of Eden.

02:12.082 --> 02:13.792
Do you, Aguilar de Nerha,

02:14.919 --> 02:17.713
swear to honor our order
in the fight for freedom?

02:18.631 --> 02:21.217
To defend mankind
against Templars' tyranny,

02:22.176 --> 02:24.011
and preserve free will?

02:24.428 --> 02:26.180
I swear.

02:26.263 --> 02:28.515
If the Apple falls
into their hands,

02:28.933 --> 02:31.477
the Templars will destroy
everything that stands in their way.

02:31.518 --> 02:34.730
Protest, dissent, our right
to think for ourselves.

02:35.105 --> 02:37.191
Swear to me that you
will sacrifice your life

02:37.608 --> 02:40.611
and lives of everyone
here to keep it from them.

02:41.237 --> 02:42.947
Yes, Mentor.

02:51.497 --> 02:53.207
Our lives are nothing.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.210
The Apple is everything.

02:57.294 --> 02:59.880
The spirit of the Eagle,
will watch over the future.

03:20.484 --> 03:24.196
Where other men blindly
follow the truth,

03:24.863 --> 03:27.616
remember, nothing is true.

03:28.158 --> 03:32.830
Where other men are
limited by morality or law,

03:33.205 --> 03:36.625
remember,
everything is permitted.

03:39.962 --> 03:44.717
We work in the darkness
to serve the light.

03:46.302 --> 03:48.721
We are Assassins.

04:44.818 --> 04:48.113
<i>Baja California, Mexico 1986</i>

05:26.735 --> 05:28.404
Shit.

06:23.918 --> 06:25.586
Mom?

07:11.340 --> 07:13.050
Dad?

07:13.300 --> 07:15.553
Your blood is not
your own, Cal.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.516
They've found us.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.201
Live in the shadows.

07:44.915 --> 07:46.709
Go!
Go now!

08:35.090 --> 08:36.799
<i>30 YEARS LATER</i>

08:38.385 --> 08:42.806
<i>HUNTSVILLE PENITENTIARY,
TEXAS, USA</i>

09:35.192 --> 09:36.860
You're here to save my soul.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.948
Something like that.

09:43.325 --> 09:45.119
I...

09:46.161 --> 09:47.872
I understand it is your birthday.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.624
Yeah.

09:50.916 --> 09:52.626
The party is just
getting started.

09:57.089 --> 09:59.758
Sit down.
You're making me nervous.

10:15.858 --> 10:17.568
Lord,

10:17.860 --> 10:19.570
wash away my sin,

10:20.487 --> 10:22.198
and I'll be clean...

10:23.824 --> 10:25.534
Once again.

10:31.874 --> 10:33.709
You're not much for
the Bible, are you?

11:05.199 --> 11:07.159
Be it known that
Callum Lynch

11:07.910 --> 11:10.287
has been found guilty
of capital murder

11:11.163 --> 11:16.252
and sentenced to die
on this day, October 21st 2016.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.213
Does the prisoner wish
to make a final statement?

11:19.922 --> 11:21.924
Tell my father that
I'll see him in hell.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.319
My name is Dr. Sophia Rikkin.

13:06.737 --> 13:12.409
At six pm yesterday evening, you
were executed and pronounced dead.

13:13.452 --> 13:17.498
And so far, as anyone in
the world knows or cares,

13:18.290 --> 13:20.167
you no longer exist.

13:29.593 --> 13:31.720
It's better you to sit.

13:34.390 --> 13:35.015
My eyes...

13:35.057 --> 13:38.769
What are you feeling right now
is normal and uncomfortable.

13:40.688 --> 13:42.356
Cal.

13:43.357 --> 13:45.067
I'm here to help you.

13:45.943 --> 13:47.653
And you're here to help me.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.335
Let him go.

14:37.119 --> 14:38.829
Don't touch him.

15:35.886 --> 15:37.555
Go ahead.
Do it.

15:40.975 --> 15:42.685
Jump.

15:46.230 --> 15:47.898
You're not a
prisoner here, Cal.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.610
I'm here to protect you.

15:51.819 --> 15:54.029
If you listen to me, everything
is going to make sense.

15:54.613 --> 15:56.323
And you need to trust me.

15:57.241 --> 15:58.951
Where am I?

15:58.951 --> 16:03.205
You're in a rehabilitation wing
of Abstergo Foundation in Madrid,

16:03.873 --> 16:07.751
a private organization dedicated
to the perfection of human kind.

16:09.628 --> 16:13.674
With your help, we can pioneer
new ways to eradicate violence.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.655
I had this.

16:36.906 --> 16:38.365
Your father wants him in.

16:38.449 --> 16:39.408
He's my patient.

16:39.909 --> 16:41.619
This is my program.

16:44.038 --> 16:45.748
Prepare the Animus.

16:57.009 --> 16:58.427
Are the blades prepared?

16:58.469 --> 16:59.178
Right here.

17:00.429 --> 17:02.056
And we confirmed
their provenance?

17:02.097 --> 17:03.224
They belong to Aguilar.

17:03.224 --> 17:04.934
We recovered them
from his burial site.

17:05.184 --> 17:06.852
What are these?

17:07.060 --> 17:11.982
Assume final preparations.
Our regression, AndalucÃ­a, 1492.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.359
Record everything.

17:19.198 --> 17:20.907
Arms ready.

17:32.211 --> 17:33.921
What is this?

17:33.921 --> 17:36.215
I'm sorry, Cal, this is not
the way I like to do things.

17:36.257 --> 17:37.967
Then don't do it.

17:39.134 --> 17:40.844
Insert epidural.

17:51.105 --> 17:53.190
What do you want from me?

17:53.274 --> 17:54.191
Your past.

17:55.150 --> 17:56.986
Listen to me carefully, Cal.

17:58.153 --> 18:00.072
You're about to
enter the Animus.

18:00.489 --> 18:03.033
What you are about
to see, hear and feel,

18:03.450 --> 18:06.412
are the memories of someone
who has been dead for 500 years.

18:06.704 --> 18:08.414
Wait a minute.

18:09.498 --> 18:12.209
You can't change
what happens, Cal.

18:13.669 --> 18:15.379
Engage scanner.

18:22.094 --> 18:23.762
Status?

18:23.888 --> 18:27.057
Scanning DNA chains.
Searching for time frame.

18:43.282 --> 18:45.326
First memory match locked.

18:46.327 --> 18:48.037
DNA match identified.

18:53.459 --> 18:55.169
Stay with it, Cal.

19:01.091 --> 19:02.843
Attempt synchronization.

19:20.694 --> 19:22.404
We found him.
We found Aguilar.

19:29.036 --> 19:30.704
Synchronization achieved.

19:33.165 --> 19:34.875
There.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.089
Commence regression.

20:54.330 --> 20:56.040
Our mission is the boy.

21:21.273 --> 21:22.983
It's the prince.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.752
Which household
harbored the boy?

21:47.591 --> 21:49.301
Only me.

21:58.936 --> 22:00.980
Nobody else knew.
Nobody.

22:04.024 --> 22:05.901
Hang his family
and make him watch.

22:09.238 --> 22:10.948
Burn the whole village.

22:31.844 --> 22:36.015
With the prince of Granada
as captive, his father, sultan,

22:36.515 --> 22:38.893
will surrender his
rebellious city,

22:38.934 --> 22:41.437
the last safe haven
for the infidels.

22:42.938 --> 22:46.650
God will punish his
people's heresy.

22:47.234 --> 22:52.448
Finally Spain will be
under one Templar rule.

23:16.305 --> 23:18.182
Stay with the memory, Cal.

24:04.270 --> 24:07.690
Aguilar! The boy, Aguilar!
The boy!

26:24.702 --> 26:26.704
Aguilar, the boy!

26:42.595 --> 26:44.305
Pull him!

27:03.824 --> 27:05.492
Commence rehabilitation.

27:05.743 --> 27:08.495
Run a system's check,
and log his condition.

27:10.331 --> 27:11.999
You did well, Cal.

27:31.101 --> 27:33.395
Looking back it's
clear that a history

27:33.479 --> 27:35.731
of the world is
history a violence.

27:37.233 --> 27:40.945
Last year the economic
impact of antisocial behavior

27:40.986 --> 27:43.155
was 9 trillion dollars.

27:45.491 --> 27:49.537
We believe that man
today experiences

27:49.620 --> 27:54.750
a measure of aggression which
he finds no acceptable outlets.

27:55.876 --> 28:01.173
Now imagine if all these costs
could be channeled elsewhere...

28:01.257 --> 28:03.342
So the regression went well?

28:03.968 --> 28:05.678
Lynch is the one.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.972
Direct descendent of Aguilar.

28:08.847 --> 28:11.433
Everything was clear in there,
for the first time.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.897
What do we all dream of?
A more peaceful world.

28:16.939 --> 28:18.899
I see you stole my lines again.

28:18.983 --> 28:20.776
I only steal from the best.

28:22.236 --> 28:23.946
And the artifact?

28:24.154 --> 28:26.824
The Apple. It's within our grasp.

28:27.783 --> 28:30.160
What happened in there?
Why did you pull him?

28:30.494 --> 28:33.414
I had to.
We have to keep him healthy.

28:34.123 --> 28:38.043
Earn his confidence.
And I know he'll lead us to it.

28:38.460 --> 28:39.253
Push him.

28:39.336 --> 28:42.256
That's not how
the Animus works.

28:53.183 --> 28:54.894
Here you go.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.230
Thank you.

28:59.857 --> 29:02.818
1917 Rutherford
splits the atom.

29:03.903 --> 29:07.281
1953 Watson and Crick
find a double helix.

29:08.449 --> 29:12.077
2016 my daughter

29:13.037 --> 29:14.955
finds the cure for violence.

29:22.880 --> 29:25.132
You've always been brighter than me.

29:28.844 --> 29:30.512
I'm late.

29:30.888 --> 29:33.849
I have to report to the Elders.

29:55.913 --> 29:59.667
Francisco Rizi's Grand
Inquisition. 1492.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.545
War, religious prosecution,

30:02.545 --> 30:06.006
and the closest that Father
Torquemada or any of our Order

30:06.006 --> 30:07.883
came to a finding the Apple of Eden.

30:09.843 --> 30:11.470
How are you, my friend?

30:11.554 --> 30:11.971
Well.

30:13.722 --> 30:14.932
Your Excellency.

30:14.974 --> 30:17.309
Next week when
the Elders meet,

30:17.518 --> 30:20.437
we shall vote to discontinue
your Abstergo project.

30:22.022 --> 30:24.441
We feel that giving
you 3 billion annually,

30:24.441 --> 30:26.735
could be better spent elsewhere.

30:26.861 --> 30:29.071
Tri billion is
nothing compared to...

30:29.113 --> 30:29.864
We've won.

30:30.698 --> 30:33.158
People are no longer care
about their civil liberties,

30:33.158 --> 30:34.869
they care about their
standard of life.

30:35.744 --> 30:38.831
The modern world has
outgrown notions like freedom.

30:40.124 --> 30:41.834
They are content to follow.

30:42.209 --> 30:46.505
The threat remains
while free will exists.

30:47.673 --> 30:52.052
For centuries we try with religion,
with politics and now consumerism

30:52.177 --> 30:53.888
to eliminate dissent.

30:54.597 --> 30:57.099
Isn't it the time we
gave a science a try?

30:57.725 --> 31:00.269
My daughter is closer
than we've ever been.

31:00.561 --> 31:02.271
How is your beautiful daughter?

31:04.356 --> 31:06.734
She has traced
protectors of the Apple.

31:09.153 --> 31:10.863
Where?

31:11.238 --> 31:14.283
AndalucÃ­a, 1492.

31:14.867 --> 31:15.701
The descendents?

31:15.743 --> 31:17.578
All the blood lines
have died out.

31:18.621 --> 31:20.289
But one.

31:21.165 --> 31:25.419
We've traced his back 500 years,
to the Assassin's Brotherhood.

32:39.243 --> 32:42.288
Hallucinations are what we
call the "bleeding effect."

32:43.372 --> 32:45.165
Images of your regression,

32:46.083 --> 32:48.836
laying themselves over your
present day field of vision.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.886
If you allow me, I can teach
you how to control them.

32:59.013 --> 33:01.015
Stand down.
I have this.

33:02.219 --> 33:03.470
Let it be.

33:03.512 --> 33:06.598
What is it?
The machine?

33:07.516 --> 33:09.184
It's genetic memory.

33:10.519 --> 33:12.229
By using the Animus,

33:12.229 --> 33:15.816
we can relive lives of
those who made us who we are.

33:28.829 --> 33:32.416
What I saw in there,
it felt real.

33:33.208 --> 33:34.918
It was.

33:36.837 --> 33:37.629
In a way.

33:37.713 --> 33:39.548
Don't mess with me!

33:40.632 --> 33:42.384
I feel different now.

33:44.970 --> 33:46.347
Why the aggression?

33:46.430 --> 33:48.307
I'm an aggressive person.

33:50.184 --> 33:51.894
What kind of prison is this?

33:52.645 --> 33:54.355
It's not a prison, Cal.

33:54.730 --> 33:56.940
You'll learn more if you cooperate.

33:57.983 --> 33:59.693
Let me go.

34:11.538 --> 34:13.248
I'm hungry.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.960
Come with me.

34:40.859 --> 34:45.239
<i>LYNCH
1979-present</i>

34:45.614 --> 34:47.324
What is this?

34:47.866 --> 34:49.952
I know everything about you, Cal.

34:52.996 --> 34:56.458
Your medical data,
your psychological profile,

34:57.292 --> 34:59.378
the mutations in
your MAO-A gene.

35:01.088 --> 35:02.798
I know about the foster homes.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.550
The juvenile homes.

35:06.010 --> 35:09.179
You are a living proof of the
link between heredity and crime.

35:09.221 --> 35:10.931
How did you find me?

35:11.265 --> 35:12.975
We found Aguilar.

35:13.809 --> 35:16.729
When you were arrested,
your DNA matched his.

35:19.064 --> 35:21.984
- Who is Aguilar?
- Your ancestor.

35:23.193 --> 35:24.903
His family were Assassins.

35:25.070 --> 35:26.947
They were burnt at the
stake by the Templars,

35:26.947 --> 35:29.908
Torquemada and the black night
you saw, Ojeda.

35:31.493 --> 35:33.704
Aguilar took up the
Assassins' cause.

35:38.584 --> 35:40.294
Do you go out much?

35:40.836 --> 35:42.504
More than you.

35:45.090 --> 35:48.802
And the others in here?
Are they the lab rats too?

35:48.802 --> 35:51.889
They are Assassins,
murderers like their ancestors.

35:52.890 --> 35:54.600
Like you, Cal.

35:55.059 --> 35:58.270
All born with
predisposition to violence.

36:05.194 --> 36:06.862
Murderer?

36:07.738 --> 36:09.990
- You killed the man.
- A pimp.

36:12.284 --> 36:13.994
Would you kill again?

36:21.377 --> 36:23.087
Happy families.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.090
She must be very proud.

36:27.049 --> 36:28.759
I wouldn't know.

36:29.551 --> 36:31.261
She was killed by an Assassin.

36:32.221 --> 36:33.931
Like your mother.

36:36.433 --> 36:38.102
Sorry.

36:43.565 --> 36:45.526
My old man killed my mother.

36:46.527 --> 36:48.362
And how does that make you feel?

36:51.156 --> 36:52.866
Like killing him.

36:56.412 --> 36:59.123
Either we let it to effect
us for the rest of our lives,

36:59.289 --> 37:01.375
or we just do something about it.

37:02.084 --> 37:05.462
You turn to violence,
I turn to science.

37:07.881 --> 37:09.925
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.

37:10.509 --> 37:12.261
I believe it exists.

37:13.429 --> 37:17.308
The Bible tells us it contained the
seed of man's first disobedience.

37:19.685 --> 37:21.979
But there are those of us
who believe that

37:23.188 --> 37:26.483
God or some ancient civilization

37:27.318 --> 37:30.988
have left us a road map to
understand why people are violent.

37:32.906 --> 37:36.577
Aguilar was the last person known
to have had it in his possession.

37:37.536 --> 37:39.747
We need you to find
out where he hid it.

37:42.124 --> 37:44.293
I thought I was here to be cured.

37:44.376 --> 37:45.878
Violence is a disease.

37:46.378 --> 37:48.088
Like cancer.

37:48.255 --> 37:52.468
And like cancer,
we hope to control it one day.

37:53.469 --> 37:55.220
Violence is what kept me alive.

37:56.263 --> 37:57.973
Well technically, you're dead.

38:02.311 --> 38:04.021
I'm hungry.

38:07.232 --> 38:08.942
What's in it for me?

38:08.942 --> 38:12.196
Once my research is complete,
there is no reason to keep you here.

38:13.906 --> 38:15.616
I get my life back?

38:16.241 --> 38:18.911
Better. A new one.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.790
You are hungry.

38:43.435 --> 38:45.980
You don't know who he is,
what he is.

38:47.064 --> 38:48.774
He is a dangerous man.

38:49.817 --> 38:51.610
Give him little more time, Emir.

38:52.277 --> 38:54.989
Man may prove that has
some noble blood in him yet.

39:00.619 --> 39:02.287
How about, sir?

39:05.833 --> 39:09.503
It's an open menu,
but we do recommend a chicken.

39:16.510 --> 39:19.596
What can I get you, Mr. Lynch?
It's an open menu,

39:19.638 --> 39:21.348
but we do recommend a chicken.

39:25.477 --> 39:26.478
I'll steak.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.564
Steak for the pioneer.

39:33.444 --> 39:35.154
Who are you?

39:37.698 --> 39:39.366
They call me Moussa.

39:40.826 --> 39:45.247
But my name is Baptiste.
I'm dead 200 years now.

39:46.415 --> 39:48.125
Voodoo poisoner.

39:49.418 --> 39:51.086
I'm harmless.

39:57.926 --> 39:59.803
They're watching you.

40:00.679 --> 40:03.015
Waiting to see who you are, pioneer.

40:06.935 --> 40:08.646
Have you met him yet?

40:11.273 --> 40:13.233
Have you met him yet?

40:15.819 --> 40:18.572
We are the last to protect
the Apple, my friend.

40:19.406 --> 40:24.286
Pick the wrong choice,
you'll send us all to infinity.

40:29.249 --> 40:30.959
This...

40:32.878 --> 40:34.546
belongs to you.

40:47.726 --> 40:49.603
You're going to lead
them right to it.

40:50.229 --> 40:52.523
Ne, I'm going to eat it.

41:06.245 --> 41:07.955
What the fuck is going on?

41:36.608 --> 41:38.485
He has to go back in the Animus.

41:41.822 --> 41:43.532
Now.

41:44.575 --> 41:46.785
He needs more time
before he goes in again.

41:46.785 --> 41:48.746
We don't have time.

41:50.664 --> 41:52.374
Why?

41:56.170 --> 41:57.880
I won't risk his life.

42:01.550 --> 42:04.094
Then I'll have to find
someone else to do it.

43:15.165 --> 43:17.960
- You're up, slugger.
- I'm crazy.

43:23.424 --> 43:25.134
I'm crazy.

43:26.343 --> 43:30.514
Crazy for feeling so lonely.

43:40.065 --> 43:41.775
They're getting him back in again.

43:41.900 --> 43:45.321
We should stop him
before he betrays us.

43:47.573 --> 43:49.116
Set the date for the six.

43:49.199 --> 43:51.827
If his condition deteriorates,
pull him out.

43:52.161 --> 43:54.788
- You father...
- I don't care what my father said.

43:55.914 --> 44:00.627
What in the world did I do?

44:00.669 --> 44:02.963
- Cal, listen to me.
- I'm crazy for trying...

44:03.005 --> 44:05.841
Listen to me.
You have to stay with Aguilar.

44:05.924 --> 44:07.301
Crazy for crying...

44:07.301 --> 44:09.803
Staying in synch-void
could be dangerous.

44:09.970 --> 44:15.976
And I'm crazy for loving you...

44:54.014 --> 44:56.100
Soon they will march on Granada.

44:58.310 --> 45:00.688
Sultan Muhammad is weak.

45:03.107 --> 45:05.275
He'll surrender the Apple

45:05.985 --> 45:09.446
and betray the
Creed to save the prince.

45:11.782 --> 45:14.660
The love makes us weak.

45:20.082 --> 45:24.920
Gladly I'll sacrifice
my flesh and blood,

45:25.421 --> 45:27.631
for survival of the Creed.

45:43.772 --> 45:47.818
When I die today,
don't waste your tears for me.

46:35.115 --> 46:37.826
The Lord spoke.

46:39.995 --> 46:41.664
And he said:

46:42.915 --> 46:45.292
"If a man abide not in me

46:46.168 --> 46:47.878
he is cast into the fire

46:49.296 --> 46:51.215
and he is burned!"

46:55.469 --> 46:57.137
For decades,

46:58.097 --> 47:02.101
you have lived in
the world torn apart

47:02.434 --> 47:04.937
by religious discord.

47:05.646 --> 47:09.274
But soon, thanks to God

47:10.985 --> 47:12.736
and Inquisition

47:14.279 --> 47:18.075
we will purge this disease!

47:25.874 --> 47:28.961
The sinners before you,

47:29.795 --> 47:33.382
sought to defend the
heretic prince of Granada,

47:34.883 --> 47:38.012
the last heathen stronghold

47:38.470 --> 47:40.806
in our holy war.

47:41.598 --> 47:43.309
So today,

47:43.809 --> 47:47.438
before our king and queen

47:48.272 --> 47:50.649
I swear we shall
wash ourselves clean,

47:51.108 --> 47:54.069
in the holy fire of God!

47:58.198 --> 47:59.867
Behold...

48:01.452 --> 48:03.162
God's will!

48:07.041 --> 48:10.961
You will watch your mentor burn
and then you will die the slowest.

48:26.143 --> 48:28.437
Give glory to the future.

48:30.064 --> 48:31.774
Not to us.

49:08.602 --> 49:10.312
He is synchronizing.

49:25.828 --> 49:27.538
Damned heretics!

49:44.680 --> 49:46.348
Don't let them escape!

55:20.474 --> 55:22.142
Jump.

55:38.242 --> 55:39.952
Complete desynch.

55:40.703 --> 55:42.413
Get him down!

55:43.664 --> 55:45.374
Call the medics!

55:51.588 --> 55:55.634
Okay. It's okay.
Cal, stay with me. Cal.

55:55.801 --> 55:58.053
Stay... It's okay.
Hurry up!

55:59.054 --> 56:02.182
Okay. Okay.
Look at me.

56:10.482 --> 56:12.192
Look at me.

56:37.009 --> 56:38.761
I can't feel my legs.

56:39.637 --> 56:41.347
Paralysis is temporal.

56:44.266 --> 56:45.976
What's the bad news?

56:46.268 --> 56:49.271
It caused a neurological split
but we got you through it.

56:50.189 --> 56:51.899
This time.

56:52.524 --> 56:54.193
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?

56:58.280 --> 56:59.990
No.

57:01.742 --> 57:04.203
Not if you go in there
on your own free will.

57:07.831 --> 57:09.541
I can't do this.

57:10.668 --> 57:12.336
Yes, you can.

57:12.670 --> 57:16.256
The Apple. You're the only
one left who can find it.

57:17.591 --> 57:21.136
We can put an end to pain, Cal.

57:22.554 --> 57:24.264
For everyone.

57:52.334 --> 57:53.335
Where did you get this?

57:53.377 --> 57:56.130
My father recovered it from the
scene of your mother's murder.

57:56.422 --> 57:58.882
And brought it here for safekeeping.

57:58.924 --> 57:59.842
Safekeeping?

58:02.636 --> 58:03.387
You stole it.

58:03.470 --> 58:06.640
It's your mother's necklace.
I wanted you to have it.

58:08.475 --> 58:09.768
Why was he there?

58:09.852 --> 58:11.770
- To save her.
- From whom?

58:12.146 --> 58:14.440
- Her own people.
- What's that got to do with you?

58:15.691 --> 58:18.736
Assassins and Templars have
been at war for centuries.

58:19.737 --> 58:21.447
I aim to change that.

58:21.655 --> 58:23.490
That's right, I forgot.

58:23.741 --> 58:25.826
We're here to combat aggression.

58:28.579 --> 58:30.539
I don't think I like your methods.

58:32.708 --> 58:34.418
I am a scientist.

58:35.085 --> 58:36.879
I'm here to be cured of violence.

58:39.214 --> 58:40.924
Who's gonna cure you?

59:28.305 --> 59:30.015
We're feeding the beast.

59:31.475 --> 59:33.185
We're making him stronger.

59:46.740 --> 59:48.450
I am Dr Rikkin.

59:50.786 --> 59:52.454
Alan.

59:53.622 --> 59:56.166
I look after things
here in Abstergo.

59:59.003 --> 01:00:02.006
You like to keep the
things in the family, huh?

01:00:02.047 --> 01:00:02.464
Yes.

01:00:04.591 --> 01:00:07.219
I'm sorry if we caused
you any discomfort.

01:00:08.429 --> 01:00:09.680
Is there anything I can do?

01:00:09.763 --> 01:00:11.348
How about you let me out of here?

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:23.902
That's something
I can't manage.

01:00:27.197 --> 01:00:28.907
I'm here to make a deal.

01:00:30.909 --> 01:00:32.619
We need the Apple.

01:00:34.496 --> 01:00:36.540
And we need you to get it for us.

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:41.503
You've been desynching
in the Animus.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.049
We need you not to do that.

01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:47.217
Sending me back to the machine?

01:00:48.552 --> 01:00:51.805
No, you've already shown us
what we needed to see.

01:00:51.889 --> 01:00:53.599
Will you let us free then?

01:01:03.067 --> 01:01:05.277
What do you hope to gain
from the newcomer?

01:01:08.155 --> 01:01:10.157
Something that'll benefit us all.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.620
You too, Moussa.

01:01:39.728 --> 01:01:41.438
What have you done to them?

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:47.653
It's what happens if you don't enter
in regression on your own volition.

01:01:54.952 --> 01:01:56.662
Do you recognize this?

01:01:57.788 --> 01:01:59.498
It's Assassin's blade.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.670
This is the actual one...

01:02:07.047 --> 01:02:09.842
your father used to
take your mother's life.

01:02:13.095 --> 01:02:14.763
He's here, you know?

01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:23.731
Mother's death, Cal.

01:02:25.399 --> 01:02:27.776
Not something a boy
should ever be made to see.

01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:19.244
This is wrong.

01:03:19.578 --> 01:03:21.288
You left me no choice.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:23.832
He has to go in on his own
free will, you said that.

01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:27.294
- I had to negotiate.
- You mean manipulate?

01:03:29.797 --> 01:03:33.050
I assured the Elders
we would have the Apple for London.

01:03:37.137 --> 01:03:38.847
That's in two days.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.144
He doesn't want to know his past,
or his father.

01:03:44.645 --> 01:03:46.981
He wants to destroy them, both.

01:03:47.815 --> 01:03:50.943
We're not in the business
of creating monsters.

01:03:51.443 --> 01:03:53.821
We neither created them
nor destroyed them.

01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:56.824
We merely abandoned them
to their own inexorable faith.

01:04:12.298 --> 01:04:15.634
- You're your mother's son.
- What does that mean?

01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:21.557
Blood that flows through you
is not your own.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:24.518
Belongs to the Creed.

01:04:25.519 --> 01:04:27.187
Your mother knew that.

01:04:28.605 --> 01:04:30.316
She died so the Creed may live.

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.237
Remind me how, exactly!

01:04:37.948 --> 01:04:40.617
What you saw, I did.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.830
You murdered her.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:52.588
I took her life rather than
have it stolen by that machine.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:58.302
Man grows with the greatness
of his task.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.306
I ought to have killed you.

01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:06.852
I couldn't.

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.147
Well, here.

01:05:11.398 --> 01:05:13.108
Take it.

01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:15.444
Do what you couldn't
do 30 years ago.

01:05:15.819 --> 01:05:17.529
It's in your hands now, Cal.

01:05:18.947 --> 01:05:20.616
This is what they want.

01:05:21.533 --> 01:05:23.202
Spill my blood.

01:05:25.037 --> 01:05:27.081
But do not go back in the Animus.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.708
Why?

01:05:30.501 --> 01:05:34.546
The Apple contains the
genetic code for free will.

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.299
They will use it to destroy us.

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.345
I'm gonna find it.

01:05:43.514 --> 01:05:47.434
And watch them destroy
you and your Creed.

01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:50.771
You can not kill the Creed.

01:05:51.605 --> 01:05:53.315
It's in your blood.

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.693
The Apple is everything.

01:05:56.694 --> 01:05:58.404
Your mother died to protect it.

01:06:02.032 --> 01:06:03.742
She had no choice.

01:06:12.876 --> 01:06:14.586
I do.

01:07:01.008 --> 01:07:02.676
You're gonna kill the Creed!

01:07:10.851 --> 01:07:12.561
Take me to the Animus.

01:07:21.028 --> 01:07:22.738
Put me in.

01:07:23.155 --> 01:07:24.865
Prepare the Animus.

01:07:24.865 --> 01:07:26.575
Voluntary regression.

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:32.039
Do you know how the
Assassins came to be named?

01:07:33.165 --> 01:07:36.710
From an Arabic word "Hashashin".

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.338
They were society's outcasts.

01:07:39.546 --> 01:07:43.175
Those who stole,
who murdered in cold blood.

01:07:45.177 --> 01:07:49.348
People ridiculed them...
Rebels, fools, drug addicts.

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:51.517
But they were wise.

01:07:52.726 --> 01:07:56.397
They used this reputation to hide
the dedication to principles

01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:59.358
beyond those of even
their strongest enemies.

01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:04.780
And for that I admire them.

01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:10.619
But you're not one of those men.

01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:13.789
Are you?

01:08:14.832 --> 01:08:16.500
Let's find out.

01:08:24.383 --> 01:08:26.051
Commencing regression.

01:08:32.474 --> 01:08:34.350
This is my life's work.

01:08:36.478 --> 01:08:38.188
It's my life.

01:09:26.403 --> 01:09:28.113
For the Creed.

01:09:31.992 --> 01:09:33.702
Our own lives...

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.247
What matters is what
we leave behind.

01:09:54.515 --> 01:09:56.183
Sultan...

01:09:57.142 --> 01:09:58.811
Surrender the Apple.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:00.980
Your Assassin protectors are gone.

01:10:02.022 --> 01:10:04.942
The Creed is finished.

01:10:46.066 --> 01:10:47.776
My son.

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.525
Here lies the seed

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.403
of man's first disobedience,

01:11:33.697 --> 01:11:35.407
of free will itself.

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:48.170
Thanks to the Apple of Eden,

01:11:49.129 --> 01:11:50.839
the known world

01:11:52.091 --> 01:11:54.176
shall be ushered into a new age.

01:11:55.594 --> 01:11:57.304
One of peace,

01:11:58.305 --> 01:12:01.558
in which all the warring
populations of mankind

01:12:01.934 --> 01:12:04.603
shall bow in perfect obedience

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:08.190
to our one templar rule.

01:13:13.964 --> 01:13:15.674
The Apple.

01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:18.427
Give it to him.

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.347
Now.

01:13:24.141 --> 01:13:25.851
For the Creed.

01:15:27.264 --> 01:15:28.974
Go!

01:16:30.411 --> 01:16:32.121
Forgive me.

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.220
It's over!

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.435
Assassin!

01:18:47.464 --> 01:18:49.133
A leap of faith.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.450
Where are we?

01:19:15.993 --> 01:19:17.661
It looks like a military port.

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:32.509
Kadiz, Palos de la Frontera.

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:12.132
The Assassins died for it.

01:20:13.592 --> 01:20:15.302
Protect it with your life.

01:20:17.054 --> 01:20:18.806
I am a friend of the Creed.

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:28.023
Take it to your grave.

01:20:29.233 --> 01:20:30.943
I swear.

01:20:49.086 --> 01:20:50.754
What is it?
Translation.

01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:01.223
Following the light of the sun,
I shall leave this old world behind.

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:04.351
It's Christopher Columbus.

01:21:05.102 --> 01:21:06.770
Where is he buried?

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:09.898
His remains were returned to Spain.

01:21:10.482 --> 01:21:12.943
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.740
We found it.

01:21:49.605 --> 01:21:51.690
Hey All Stars, come here.

01:21:59.907 --> 01:22:01.617
Pick one.

01:22:02.826 --> 01:22:04.536
Anyone.

01:22:12.252 --> 01:22:15.214
- Breach in common room.
- Seal the Animus.

01:22:35.526 --> 01:22:37.236
Is it a memory?

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.197
No.

01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:38.547
Come on!

01:23:50.809 --> 01:23:52.978
- Transport?
- Standing by.

01:23:55.814 --> 01:23:58.484
Protect the Animus.
Purge the facility.

01:24:00.027 --> 01:24:01.695
I need to get you out of here first.

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:11.205
- No!
- We have to leave, Sophia.

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:55.958
No!

01:24:56.834 --> 01:24:58.502
No!

01:25:10.431 --> 01:25:12.141
Pick it up!

01:25:25.279 --> 01:25:26.989
You are not alone, Cal.

01:25:28.741 --> 01:25:30.451
You never were.

01:25:44.757 --> 01:25:46.467
- Open...
- Come on.

01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:03.859
Where other men blindly
follow the truth,

01:26:04.568 --> 01:26:07.404
- remember...
- Nothing is true.

01:26:08.614 --> 01:26:12.034
Where other men are
limited by morality or law,

01:26:13.953 --> 01:26:17.206
- remember...
- Everything is permitted.

01:26:18.749 --> 01:26:21.919
We work in the darkness
to serve the light.

01:26:24.129 --> 01:26:25.839
We are Assassins.

01:26:55.035 --> 01:26:56.745
What now, pioneer?

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.294
We fight.

01:30:54.608 --> 01:30:56.318
Your Excellency.

01:30:59.029 --> 01:31:00.906
The glory will go to your father.

01:31:03.075 --> 01:31:04.785
But we both know who found it.

01:31:08.956 --> 01:31:10.624
Your time will come, my child.

01:31:49.747 --> 01:31:53.626
<i>GREAT TEMPLAR LODGE,
LONDON</i>

01:32:09.141 --> 01:32:11.352
They'll give you a
Nobel peace prize for this.

01:32:11.894 --> 01:32:13.604
You better start
writing your speech.

01:32:15.689 --> 01:32:18.525
- I've read yours.
- And?

01:32:22.738 --> 01:32:25.908
If we eradicate free will,
we eradicate the Assassins.

01:32:26.367 --> 01:32:29.328
A cancer that has menaced
society for centuries.

01:32:30.996 --> 01:32:35.084
It's not my best work,
but it gets the point across.

01:32:36.919 --> 01:32:39.004
We've been looking
for solutions.

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:43.050
You've eliminated
the problem.

01:32:57.272 --> 01:32:58.983
So my program...

01:32:59.233 --> 01:33:01.860
Has brought order to
society for the first time.

01:33:05.322 --> 01:33:07.032
I'm accountable for this.

01:33:07.366 --> 01:33:09.034
You've already
been accounted for.

01:33:09.118 --> 01:33:11.036
Our work belongs to the Elders.

01:33:11.328 --> 01:33:13.038
This is their finest hour.

01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:18.627
You lied to me.

01:33:18.627 --> 01:33:20.337
I've always known

01:33:20.587 --> 01:33:24.550
that in your heart you're a
scientist first, templar second.

01:33:25.884 --> 01:33:27.928
Your recent work has
impressed as much

01:33:28.929 --> 01:33:31.765
but it has confirmed
our belief that mankind

01:33:32.516 --> 01:33:34.184
cannot be redeemed.

01:33:34.268 --> 01:33:35.978
You've thought of everything.

01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:42.776
Not quite. My speech. It could do
with one of your elegant openings.

01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:47.489
Now I've become death,

01:33:48.949 --> 01:33:50.659
the destroyer of worlds.

01:33:52.911 --> 01:33:54.622
Not sure that I
could make that work.

01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:15.267
It is with great pleasure
tonight that I introduce

01:34:15.392 --> 01:34:18.979
the architect of our
ancient order's future.

01:34:21.315 --> 01:34:25.361
Please welcome the CEO
of Abstergo Foundation,

01:34:25.486 --> 01:34:27.196
Dr. Alan Rikkin.

01:34:43.253 --> 01:34:44.964
With the recovery of the Apple,

01:34:45.589 --> 01:34:47.424
we are now in possession

01:34:47.758 --> 01:34:50.219
of the complete
genetic road map

01:34:50.636 --> 01:34:52.680
to humanity's instincts.

01:34:54.014 --> 01:34:56.892
Any impulse towards
independence,

01:34:57.434 --> 01:34:59.353
resistance or rebellion

01:35:00.145 --> 01:35:01.855
will be crushed.

01:35:02.856 --> 01:35:06.402
Any predisposition that might
oppose our march of progress

01:35:07.403 --> 01:35:10.406
can now be eradicated.

01:35:15.202 --> 01:35:16.912
All I have to do is shout.

01:35:20.374 --> 01:35:22.084
I'm here to help you.

01:35:23.627 --> 01:35:25.337
And you're here to help me.

01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:29.091
I can't help you anymore.

01:35:30.342 --> 01:35:32.344
What about all
those great plans?

01:35:34.388 --> 01:35:37.558
Cure violence,
combat aggression.

01:35:40.769 --> 01:35:42.479
That's not going to happen.

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:52.531
You've started this, Sophie.
You don't get to walk away.

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.410
We both know what
happens next.

01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:04.460
Not everything
deserves to live.

01:36:07.755 --> 01:36:09.465
I can't do this.

01:36:15.763 --> 01:36:17.473
Yes, you can.

01:36:29.652 --> 01:36:31.862
But it is not to ourselves,

01:36:32.655 --> 01:36:35.616
but to the future,
that we must give glory.

01:36:36.241 --> 01:36:39.995
A future purged of
the Assassin's Creed!

01:36:57.513 --> 01:36:59.223
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:37:00.349 --> 01:37:02.059
the Apple of Eden.

01:38:27.895 --> 01:38:29.605
I did this.

01:38:39.281 --> 01:38:41.492
I will retrieve the
artifact for the Elders.

01:38:47.206 --> 01:38:48.916
Lynch I want for me.

01:39:06.475 --> 01:39:07.726
It is not to ourselves,

01:39:07.810 --> 01:39:10.062
but to the future,
that we must give glory.
