WEBVTT

00:04.350 --> 00:06.590
YOU GOT 5 MINUTES LEFT
TO GET IT THERE.

00:06.590 --> 00:11.630
OTHERWISE, I TAKE IT
OUT OF YOUR PAY.

00:11.630 --> 00:14.560
ALWAYS WITH THE LATE
DUTY, HE SAYS.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.540
LIKE THE PIZZA
TURNS TO POISON
IF IT'S 5 MINUTES LATE.

00:19.540 --> 00:23.040
HERE'S WHAT I THINK
OF YOUR PIZZA, MR. BRONSKI.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.910
WHOA. DUDE.

00:30.910 --> 00:34.650
THAT'S SOME GNARLY TRASH.

00:34.650 --> 00:36.820
FAR OUT.

00:47.260 --> 00:49.770
LOONATICS, READY, SET...

00:49.770 --> 00:51.100
LET'S JET!

00:51.100 --> 00:53.540
WE'VE GOT A FOOD FIGHT
TO STOP.

00:59.510 --> 01:00.710
HELP!

01:00.710 --> 01:02.010
LOOKS LIKE A U.F.P.--

01:02.010 --> 01:05.220
UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING PIZZA.

01:08.790 --> 01:09.920
BLAHH!

01:09.920 --> 01:11.420
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

01:11.420 --> 01:13.020
CLOSER THAN YOU THINK.

01:13.020 --> 01:16.130
HELP! HELP!
WOULD SOMEBODY HELP ME?

01:20.560 --> 01:24.170
HALF A BATTLE. LOOK LIKE
A CHEESE WAR TO ME.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.510
I'D RECOGNIZE
THAT FACE ANYWHERE.

01:29.510 --> 01:31.880
YEAH. HE LOOKS LIKE
THAT LAZY SLACKER

01:31.880 --> 01:34.210
WHO ALWAYS SHOWS UP LATE
WITH OUR PIZZA.

01:34.210 --> 01:37.110
I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO NEVER TIPS.

01:37.110 --> 01:39.350
I'LL GIVE YOU A TIP--AAH!

01:41.790 --> 01:43.490
PIZZA!

01:46.490 --> 01:48.860
HEY, HEY, HEY!
TAKE IT EASY THERE, BIG GUY.

01:48.860 --> 01:51.090
THERE'S DUCK.

01:51.090 --> 01:52.860
SLAM, YOU CAN MUNCH
ON DUCK LATER.

01:52.860 --> 01:57.630
WE GOTTA STOP
THE PIZZA DUDE FROM MAKING
ANY MORE DELIVERIES.

01:57.630 --> 02:02.640
GUESS YOU PICKED
THE WRONG DAY TO FIRE ME,
HUH, MR. BRONSKI?

02:02.640 --> 02:04.040
OK, TOBY, OK.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.340
YOU'RE REHIRED.

02:05.340 --> 02:07.980
YOU CAN EVEN TAKE
15 MINUTES OFF...

02:07.980 --> 02:09.410
EVERY OTHER MONDAY.

02:09.410 --> 02:12.120
NO. I'M THE BOSS NOW,

02:12.120 --> 02:15.190
AND YOU'VE
JUST BEEN TERMINATED.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.430

03:37.370 --> 03:39.170
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW
HOW TOUGH DELIVERY JOBS ARE,

03:39.170 --> 03:41.000
HAVING BEEN IN THE BIZ
FOR YEARS, UNTIL I BECAME
A CRIMEFIGHTER.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.910
THAT'S ALMOST AS DANGEROUS,
BUT YOU DO GET A GOOD
DENTAL PLAN,

03:42.910 --> 03:44.010
WHICH YOU NEED, GETTING
SMACKED IN THE BEAK
ALL THE TIME.

03:44.010 --> 03:45.070
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

03:45.070 --> 03:46.810
AAH!

03:46.810 --> 03:49.680
WHOA. WH-WH-WHOA.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.380
HA HA HA HA!

04:10.100 --> 04:12.440
ALL OF THIS
OVER A MEASLY TIP?

04:12.440 --> 04:15.070
WHOA, DUDES, IT'S NOT ME.

04:15.070 --> 04:16.440
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.640
TH-TH-THAT THING,
IT WAS CONTROLLING ME.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.480
LET ME GUESS: ANOTHER
ACCIDENTAL SUPER VILLAIN?

04:21.480 --> 04:24.180
WHAT'S NEXT, VILLAINS WITH
NOTES FROM THEIR PARENTS?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.920
IT'S LIKE I WAS POSSESSED.

04:28.350 --> 04:31.360
GIVE US THE SCOOP
ON THIS HARDHAT, TECH.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.820
WELL, TO PUT IT SIMPLY,

04:32.820 --> 04:35.330
IT'S AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL
BIO-TECH SYNAPSE POWER SITE

04:35.330 --> 04:38.730
THAT ENABLES THE HOST
WITH THOUGHT CONTROL
LEVITATION POWERS.

04:38.730 --> 04:41.700
TO PUT IT SIMPLER,
A THING-A-MA-JIG.

04:41.700 --> 04:46.070
MM-HMM. MY PIZZA GUY
SAID HE COULDN'T CONTROL
HIS ACTIONS.

04:46.070 --> 04:49.440
THAT'S RIGHT. ONCE
THE THING-A-MA-JIG ATTACHED,

04:49.440 --> 04:50.840
IT TOOK OVER HIS FREE WILL

04:50.840 --> 04:54.410
AND ACTED ONLY ON HIS
DEEPEST, DARKEST DESIRES.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.980
AND THOSE
DEEP, DARK DESIRES

04:56.980 --> 05:00.820
SCORED US PLENTY
OF FREE EATS FOR SAVING
PIZZA GUY'S BOSS.

05:04.590 --> 05:07.490
AT LEAST TAKE THEM
OUT OF THE BOX FIRST.

05:07.490 --> 05:09.590
HE'S LUCKY YOU
BLASTED IT OFF WHEN YOU DID

05:09.590 --> 05:11.530
OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
STUCK TO HIM PERMANENTLY

05:11.530 --> 05:14.960
UNTIL IT DECIDED
TO LEAVE ON ITS OWN.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.270
NOW JUST HERE,
A LITTLE WINDOW HERE.

05:17.270 --> 05:19.140
CAN'T ANYBODY ELSE
FIND THE DISHWASHER?

05:19.140 --> 05:20.940
MAN, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

05:20.940 --> 05:22.040
DIG IN.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.740
SORRY. CAN'T. NO TIME.
GOTTA CLEAN UP.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.840
GOTTA GET ORGANIZED. GOTTA
MAKE ROOM FOR VISITORS,

05:25.840 --> 05:27.440
WHO I FORGOT TO MENTION I
INVITED. THEY'RE COMING FROM OUT
OF TOWN

05:27.440 --> 05:28.810
AND THEY'LL
BE HERE ANY SECOND!

05:29.610 --> 05:32.320
WHICH MEANS THIS SECOND.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.680
MOM! POP!

05:33.680 --> 05:35.150
THERE HE IS!
HOW'S THAT SON OF MINE?

05:35.150 --> 05:36.850
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AFTER
SUCH A LONG, LONG WHILE

05:36.850 --> 05:38.960
NOT SEEING HIM, BUT FINALLY
SEEING HIM IN HIS NEW DIGS

05:38.960 --> 05:40.560
WHERE HE HANGS HIS FEATHERS.
AND THIS MUST BE THE SUPER
CRIMEFIGHTING CREW

05:40.560 --> 05:42.530
I'VE HEARD ABOUT, AND,
OF COURSE, I'M RALPH RUNNER

05:42.530 --> 05:45.260
AND THIS IS HARRIET. JUST
CALL US MA AND PA RUNNER,
AND THIS IS RIP.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.030
HEY.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.230
WHOA! SETTLE DOWN, SON,
AND LET THE GROWNUPS

05:49.230 --> 05:51.170
GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE. AND I
SEE YOU ORDERED PIZZA,
WHICH I LOVE.

05:51.170 --> 05:52.870
ESPECIALLY WITH
THOSE LITTLE SESAME SEEDS.

05:54.370 --> 05:55.810
IT IS SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU, REV, HONEY,

05:55.810 --> 05:57.470
EVEN IF I SHOULD SCOLD YOU
FOR NOT CALLING MORE.

05:57.470 --> 05:58.640
JUST LOOK AT YOU AND THAT
DELICIOUS LOOKING PIZZA.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.010
OH, BUT I COULDN'T.
MAYBE I SHOULD.

06:00.010 --> 06:01.410
MAYBE JUST A SLIVER.
JUST A BIT, A BITE,

06:01.410 --> 06:04.280
A GNOSH, A SMIDGEN, A TAD.
OH, SURE.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.550
AAH! MY BRAIN IS MELTING.

06:05.550 --> 06:07.320
THERE'S A WHOLE FAMILY
OF THEM.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.990
I'M CHECKING INTO A HOTEL.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.920
UH, FOLKS, I THINK
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN
JUST A LITTLE

06:10.920 --> 06:13.490
FOR THEIR SAKES, OK?

06:13.490 --> 06:18.930
SO...NICE...TO...
MEET...YOU.

06:18.930 --> 06:21.570
OK. NOT QUITE
THAT SLOW, MOM.

06:21.570 --> 06:22.900
WELL, HI. HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.400
NOW, DON'T TELL ME.
I'M REALLY GOOD WITH NAMES.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.170
MACE, DISLEXI, SPAM,

06:27.170 --> 06:29.240
DORK, AND, OH, YEAH,

06:29.240 --> 06:30.740
THE COYOTE.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.010
OH!

06:33.040 --> 06:34.840
OH, DEAR.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.780
AND NO LEASH.

06:36.780 --> 06:39.320
SORRY. THEY HAVE
COYOTE ISSUES.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.250
MAYBE I SHOULD
GET BACK TO WORK.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.350
WOULDN'T WANT TO ACCIDENTALLY
EAT YOUR MA AND PA.

06:45.350 --> 06:46.290
UH...

06:46.290 --> 06:47.860
NOW, SON, LET'S TALK

06:47.860 --> 06:49.360
ABOUT YOU JOINING
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.690
NO, POP,
I'M A CRIME FIGHTER,
NOT A GADGET SALESMAN.

06:50.690 --> 06:52.060
LET RIP HELP YOU OUT.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.360
RIP? OH, NO PLACE
IN BUSINESS FOR A SLACKER.

06:54.360 --> 06:56.300
THERE HE GOES AGAIN.

06:56.300 --> 06:59.840
I AM SO OUT OF HERE.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.140
HE TALKS SO SLOW,
I CAN BARELY UNDERSTAND HIM.

07:02.140 --> 07:03.540
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.240
REV, SON, YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THE BEST

07:05.240 --> 07:06.440
AT WHATEVER YOU SET
YOUR SIGHTS ON,
BUT SAVING THE WORLD

07:06.440 --> 07:07.640
IS A DEAD END JOB.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.010
HERE YOU GO, SON.
HERE'S A LITTLE CASH

07:09.010 --> 07:10.610
TO TIDE YOU OVER
UNTIL YOUR NEXT PAYCHECK.

07:10.610 --> 07:12.680
WE DON'T GET PAID, MOM.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.520
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
VOLUNTEER WORK.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.190
SO I GUESS THE FAMILY
TRADE OF MAKING MONEY
SELLING GADGETS

07:18.190 --> 07:20.090
IS BENEATH YOU.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.760
WHOA, WHAT IS THAT THING?

07:23.760 --> 07:25.190
JUST ONE OF THOSE
DANGEROUSLY POWERFUL

07:25.190 --> 07:27.430
BIO-TECH BRAIN PARASITES
FROM OUTER SPACE.

07:27.430 --> 07:28.830
WHOA!

07:32.440 --> 07:33.800
WELL, SPEAKING OF GADGETS.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.970
NO! DON'T TOUCH
THE MOLECULAR RECONSTRUCTER.

07:37.970 --> 07:39.110
SWEET-MEEP-MEEP.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.850
WHOA! LOOK AT THAT.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.120
HEE HEE HEE.

07:52.190 --> 07:53.320
WHOA, YEAH!

07:53.320 --> 07:54.560
SWEET-MEEP-MEEP.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.290
THIS PLACE IS A GOLD MINE
OF GADGETS.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.660
I MEAN, NOT BAD
FOR A COYOTE.

07:57.660 --> 08:00.400
HMM. SO, HOW MUCH
FOR ONE OF THESE BABIES?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.500
MY INVENTIONS
ARE NOT FOR SALE.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.130
I SEE. PLAYING HARD BALL.
BUT I CAN PLAY
HARD BALL, TOO.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.340
70/30 SPLIT,
AND THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.

08:07.340 --> 08:09.340
NO.
I MEANT 65/35.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.510
NO WAY.
60/40?

08:10.510 --> 08:12.180
NOT TODAY.
55/45?

08:12.180 --> 08:13.240
GOTTA GO.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.240
56/44?
SEE YA.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.010
57/43?
I'M GONE.

08:16.010 --> 08:17.710
POP, HE'S REALLY
NOT INTERESTED.

08:17.710 --> 08:19.420
WELL, I THINK THE COYOTE
HAS ROADRUNNER ISSUES.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.650
GEE, POP, IT YOU WANT
A GADGET SO BAD,

08:20.650 --> 08:23.390
I CAN SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M WORKING ON.

08:23.390 --> 08:24.450
WHAT'S THIS?

08:24.450 --> 08:25.760
IT'S A ROBO AMIGO.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.590
A ROBO AMIGO?
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.790
THAT OLD SCRAP HEAP?

08:28.790 --> 08:31.530
HE'S BEEN WORKING
ON THAT THING FOREVER.

08:31.530 --> 08:34.660
WE'LL FINISH IT
BACK AT HOME TOGETHER
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.270
HMM. WELL, I'D
REALLY LIKE TO, POP,

08:36.270 --> 08:39.240
BUT I HAVE IMPORTANT
CRIMEFIGHTING DUTIES HERE.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.370
NO SWEAT, REV.

08:40.370 --> 08:41.640
SPEND SOME TIME
WITH THE FAMILY.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.570
IF ANY END-OF-THE-WORLD
CRISIS COMES UP,

08:43.570 --> 08:46.180
WE'LL GIVE YOU A BUZZ.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.650
ADULTS DON'T NEED
A ROBO AMIGO.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.520
POP SHOULD SELL IT TO KIDS.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.820
RIP, STOP BOTHERING
YOUR BROTHER.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.120
CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S DOING
IMPORTANT WORK?

09:01.120 --> 09:03.330
HOW'S MY GENIUS
WITH A WRENCH DOING?

09:03.330 --> 09:06.030
I CAN MAKE ANYTHING FUN.

09:06.030 --> 09:07.060
OH, YEAH!

09:10.030 --> 09:12.040
WELL, STILL A FEW BUGS
TECHNICALLY-WISE, BUT
MARKETING-WISE,

09:12.040 --> 09:14.100
HOW ABOUT IF WE SELL 'EM
TO KIDS INSTEAD OF ADULTS?

09:14.100 --> 09:16.810
WHY, THAT'S--THAT'S--
THAT'S--THAT'S BRILLIANT!

09:16.810 --> 09:18.610
HEY, WHAT AM I,
INVISIBLE?

09:18.610 --> 09:20.240
YOU SEE, REV,
I'M TAPPING INTO

09:20.240 --> 09:22.410
ALL THE INVENTING
AND MARKETING TALENT
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.610
I AM SO OUT OF HERE.

09:24.610 --> 09:26.250
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY
RIP'S IDEA, POP.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.280
NEVER MIND, CHOP-CHOP.
IF WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH
ROBO AMIGO

09:28.280 --> 09:32.660
IN TIME FOR
THE HOLIDAY SEASON,
WE NEED IT DONE YESTERDAY.

09:32.660 --> 09:34.160
SUPER SPEED WON'T
HELP ME MAKE THIS WORK,

09:34.160 --> 09:36.230
BUT THERE MAY BE
SOMEONE WHO CAN.

09:36.230 --> 09:37.960
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE HELP ME MAKE
MY POP PROUD OF ME

09:37.960 --> 09:39.800
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
LET HIM DOWN, BUT
I CAN'T DO IT ALONE

09:39.800 --> 09:41.360
WITHOUT A SUPER GENIUS
WIZARD TO FINISH IT.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.170
AND BY THE WAY,
DID I TELL YOU
HOW SHARP YOU LOOK TODAY?

09:43.170 --> 09:46.670
OK. OK. SINCE YOU ADMIT
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,
I'LL HELP.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.170
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THOSE COYOTE ISSUES?

09:49.170 --> 09:50.870
WELL, I TOLD HIM
YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN,

09:50.870 --> 09:53.180
SO IF THEY OFFER YOU
BIRD SEED, GO ALONG WITH IT.

09:55.850 --> 09:57.450
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,
HIM BEING HERE,

09:57.450 --> 09:58.920
EVEN IF HE IS
A VEGETARIAN.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.580
HE JUST WANTS TO LEARN
FROM THE BEST, RIGHT, TECH?

10:00.580 --> 10:02.250
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

10:02.250 --> 10:05.920
THAT'S RIGHT, AND THE BEST
IS DEFINITELY IN THE ROOM.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.420
WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE
A COYOTE WHO KNOWS
HIS LIMITATIONS.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.780
I PRESENT TO YOU
THE ROBO AMIGO!

11:03.380 --> 11:07.120
I CAN MAKE ANYTHING FUN.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.620
NEW FROM ROBO ENTERPRISES,

11:08.620 --> 11:10.020
IT'S ROBO AMIGO!

11:10.020 --> 11:12.360
HE PLAYS WITH YOU,
STAYS WITH YOU,

11:12.360 --> 11:14.820
EATS WITH YOU,
HE HELPS YOU WITH HOMEWORK,

11:14.820 --> 11:17.030
FIGHTS BULLIES,
AND UNLIKE MOST KIDS,

11:17.030 --> 11:20.760
HE'S SELF CLEANING
AND LEAVES NO UNSIGHTLY
ODORS OR STAINS.

11:20.760 --> 11:25.840
WHO NEEDS FRIENDS
WHEN YOU HAVE A ROBO AMIGO?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.200
YOUR INVENTION'S
A SMASH HIT, SON.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.070
I THINK THIS CALLS FOR
A TRIP TO MY OFFICE.

11:31.940 --> 11:35.010
BUT POP, NO ON GOES INTO
YOUR OFFICE BUT YOU EVER.

11:35.010 --> 11:36.550
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

11:36.550 --> 11:37.810
SORRY, RIP. JUST REV.

11:37.810 --> 11:39.380
HIS INVENTION
HAS EARNED HIM THE RIGHT

11:39.380 --> 11:41.550
TO ENTER THE INNER CIRCLE OF
THE RUNNER FAMILY BUSINESS.

11:41.550 --> 11:43.220
BUT--

11:45.650 --> 11:47.060
BREAKING NEWS.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.890
A MONSTROUS CREATURE
IS ATTACKING ACMETROPOLIS

11:48.890 --> 11:50.560
AND THE POLICE
CAN'T CONTAIN IT.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.530
HOLD ON, POP. MY REAL--
I MEAN OTHER JOB'S
CALLING ME.

11:53.530 --> 11:54.830
BE RIGHT BACK.

11:54.830 --> 11:56.700
THAT'S MY SUPER SON.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.670
SUPER SPEED,
SUPER INVENTOR,

12:00.670 --> 12:01.910
SUPER SALESMAN.

12:01.910 --> 12:04.870
I'M SUPER SICK AND TIRED
OF IT.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.110
HMM. WHAT'S THIS?

12:16.850 --> 12:21.830
ACCESS GRANTED.
WELCOME, REV RUNNER.

12:21.830 --> 12:23.730
OH, WITH SOMETHING COOL
LIKE THIS,

12:23.730 --> 12:26.960
MAYBE POP WILL
FINALLY NOTICE ME.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.330
YEAH.

12:31.370 --> 12:33.940
YAAH!

12:37.370 --> 12:39.940
HA HA HA HA!

12:45.280 --> 12:47.750
OH, HE'LL NOTICE ME,
ALL RIGHT.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.320
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

12:58.430 --> 13:00.660
GEE, GUYS, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T GET HERE IN TIME.

13:00.660 --> 13:02.330
I'VE BEEN REALLY BUSY.

13:02.330 --> 13:04.630
OH, YEAH. MAKING TOYS
FOR RUGRATS.

13:04.630 --> 13:06.700
WHAT ARE YOU, A CRIMEFIGHTER
OR ONE OF SANTA'S ELVES?

13:06.700 --> 13:08.400
I KNOW IT'S BEEN
TAKING UP MY TIME,

13:08.400 --> 13:09.810
BUT HELPING THE FAMILY BUSINESS
IS SO IMPORTANT TO POP

13:09.810 --> 13:11.240
AND I'M A LITTLE TOO TALL
TO BE AN ELF,

13:11.240 --> 13:13.110
BUT I PROMISE
I'LL BE WITH YOU GUYS,

13:13.110 --> 13:14.680
READY TO FIGHT EVIL-DOERS
ANY WHERE, ANY TIME,
ANY HOW!

13:14.680 --> 13:16.580
HEY, DON'T SWEAT IT, REV. -
YEAH. NO BIGGIE.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.180
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU GUYS
FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING,

13:18.180 --> 13:19.920
EVEN THOUGH I CANNOT PROMISE
I'LL NEVER FORGET

13:19.920 --> 13:21.820
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU MIGHT GET
WHACKED ON THE HEAD

13:21.820 --> 13:23.020
AND FORGET EVERYTHING,
EVEN FORGETTING ABOUT
NOT FORGETTING.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.490
YEAH, THAT'S
A GREAT STORY,

13:24.490 --> 13:27.720
BUT WE OUGHT TO GET
HANDSOME HERE IN THE CELL.

13:32.330 --> 13:35.760
DESTROYING STUFF
IS SO MUCH FUN.

13:36.770 --> 13:39.070
I CAN MAKE ANYTHING FUN.

13:39.070 --> 13:41.870
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT, ROBO AMIGO.

13:41.870 --> 13:43.910
MMM! YUM, YUM, YUM!

13:43.910 --> 13:44.940
OR ESPECIALLY THAT.

13:44.940 --> 13:46.340
HA HA HA HA HA!

13:46.340 --> 13:48.240
I'LL BET BY CONCENTRATING
MY NEW POWERS

13:48.240 --> 13:50.680
INTO ROBO AMIGO'S
CENTRAL PROCESSOR

13:50.680 --> 13:52.920
I CAN CONTROL
ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.520
AH HA HA HA HA HA!

13:56.520 --> 13:57.650
ALL ACROSS ACMETROPOLIS,

13:57.650 --> 13:59.390
THE HUGELY POPULAR
ROBO AMIGOS

13:59.390 --> 14:01.760
ARE TURNING FROM
EVERY KID'S BEST FRIEND

14:01.760 --> 14:03.690
INTO EVERY PARENT'S
WORST NIGHTMARE.

14:03.690 --> 14:06.500
NO WORD YET FROM THEIR
MAKER, RUNNER ENTERPRISES.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.160
THAT'S IT. WE'RE FINISHED.
WASHED UP,

14:08.160 --> 14:10.530
OUT OF BUSINESS,
PUT A FORK IN ME, I'M DONE.

14:10.530 --> 14:13.270
TRY A SEED BUN, DEAR.
IT'LL KEEP YOUR STRENGTH UP.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.870
POP, I'M SURE
I CAN FIND THE ANSWER.

14:14.870 --> 14:17.040
YEAH, IT'S CALLED
TOTAL PRODUCT RECALL,

14:17.040 --> 14:18.470
THEN BANKRUPTCY,
THEN HOMELESSNESS.

14:18.470 --> 14:20.410
OH, DEAR. AND I
JUST BOUGHT NEW CURTAINS.

14:20.410 --> 14:21.980
ONCE I FIX WHATEVER MADE
ROBO AMIGO GO BERSERK,

14:21.980 --> 14:23.410
WE CAN SEND A REPAIR CHIP
TO EVERY CUSTOMER--

14:23.410 --> 14:25.410
OH, SEED BUNS! YUMMY!
MY FAVORITE!

14:25.410 --> 14:29.250
THANKS, MOM, AND I KNOW
JUST WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.690
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.290
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

14:32.290 --> 14:35.420
PLEASE, PLEASE...
DON'T MAKE ME BEG.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.130
UH, YOU ARE BEGGING.

14:37.130 --> 14:38.530
THEN PLEASE MAKE ME STOP.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.400
OK, OK, I'LL HELP YOU,

14:40.400 --> 14:43.330
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I WANT TO KNOW HOW SOMETHING
I DESIGNED BROKE DOWN.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.100
OH, THANKS, TECH.
IF YOU WEREN'T A COYOTE--

14:45.100 --> 14:46.400
AND A GUY--I'D KISS YOU!

14:46.400 --> 14:50.310
THEN LUCKY FOR ME
I'M BOTH.

14:50.310 --> 14:51.470
HMM.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.510
SENSORS, CHIPS,
AND SECURITY INTERFACE

14:54.510 --> 14:56.050
ALL CHECKS OUT FINE.

14:56.050 --> 14:59.080
MAYBE THE GLITCH
IS IN THE REMOTE.

15:05.150 --> 15:07.690
DON'T LET HIM
GO OVER THE--

15:07.690 --> 15:10.990
CLIFF.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.600
I CAME PREPARED THIS TIME.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.470
GREAT, TECH,
BUT WHAT ABOUT ROBO AMIGO?

15:17.470 --> 15:20.000
IF IT'S NOT
IN INTERNAL PROBLEM, THEN
WHAT'S FLIPPING HIM OUT?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.670
SOMETHING EXTERNAL.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.570
ROBO AMIGO'S
BEING CONTROLLED
BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING

15:24.570 --> 15:27.010
ON THE OUTSIDE.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.450
AND THAT WOULD BE ME, BRO.

15:31.450 --> 15:32.620
RIP, IS THAT YOU?

15:32.620 --> 15:35.880
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
A SUPER FAILURE, REV?

15:35.880 --> 15:37.190
HE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF.

15:37.190 --> 15:38.820
HE'S POSSESSED
BY THE BIO-TECH PARASITE.

15:38.820 --> 15:42.130
IT'S MAKING HIM ACT OUT
ON HIS DEEPEST,
DARKEST FEELINGS.

15:42.130 --> 15:44.560
TIME TO SHOW POP
WHO'S TOP BIRD.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.500
I'VE DISCOVERED
WHAT I'M SUPER AT--

15:47.500 --> 15:49.330
DESTROYING THINGS.

15:49.330 --> 15:52.340
AND THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO
BEGIN MY NEW CAREER CHOICE

15:52.340 --> 15:56.540
THAN WITH THE BIGGEST
TARGET OF ALL--

15:56.540 --> 15:57.940
ACMETROPOLIS!

15:57.940 --> 15:59.110
HA HA HA HA!

15:59.110 --> 16:03.510
AH HA HA HA HA HA!

16:12.360 --> 16:14.690
EH, THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

16:14.690 --> 16:16.890
PEOPLE OF ACMETROPOLIS,

16:16.890 --> 16:19.160
FEAR FOR YOUR LIVES!

16:19.160 --> 16:22.500
THE RIP IS ON A TEAR.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.530
HA HA HA HA HA!

16:24.530 --> 16:26.840
I'VE ALREADY GOT
A SIGNATURE TAUNT.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.140
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

16:28.140 --> 16:29.240
BUT I DON'T GET TO SEE
MY FAMILY OFTEN--

16:29.240 --> 16:30.540
HEY, IT'S OK, REV.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.080
WE ALL HAVE
FAMILY PROBLEMS SOMETIMES.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.910
WE GOT EVEN BIGGER
PROBLEMS.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.210
WHEN RIP SNATCHED
THE PARASITE,

16:36.210 --> 16:38.250
HE ALSO TOOK MY MOLECULAR
RECONSTRUCTER.

16:38.250 --> 16:42.950
SO WHAT'S HE GONNA DO,
MAKE ROBO AMIGO TINY AMIGO?

16:42.950 --> 16:46.320
OH, QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.600
COME ON, PEOPLE.
LET'S HAVE SOME FUN.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.700
POP SAYS
I HAVE NO AMBITION.

16:55.700 --> 17:00.940
HOW'S THAT FOR THINKING BIG?
HA HA HA HA HA!

17:00.940 --> 17:04.340
DESTROYING A CITY IS FUN.

17:04.340 --> 17:07.040
FLEEING, PANIC, SCREAMING.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.950
IT'S GOOD
TO FINALLY BE NOTICED.

17:09.950 --> 17:12.750
COME BACK!
DON'T YOU WANT TO PLAY?

17:12.750 --> 17:14.650
ROBO AMIGO GONE WRONG
IS AN INVENTOR'S
WORST NIGHTMARE,

17:14.650 --> 17:16.720
BUT IF I CAN REACH HIS HEAD,
I CAN SHUT HIM DOWN.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.420
THEN WE CAN WORK TOGETHER
TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, RIP?

17:18.420 --> 17:20.820
NO! YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

17:20.820 --> 17:22.260
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

17:22.260 --> 17:24.890
THIS TIME IT'S ABOUT ME.

17:24.890 --> 17:28.000
THIS IS NOT FUN.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.530
LITTLE BROTHER,
YOU NEED TO CHILL.

17:30.530 --> 17:32.500
TRY SOME YOGA.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.400
HYAH!

17:34.400 --> 17:37.170
I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.850
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
TO GET YOU TO STOP?

17:45.850 --> 17:47.020
I WANT YOU TO FIGHT ME.

17:47.020 --> 17:48.450
I CAN'T FIGHT
MY LITTLE BROTHER.

17:48.450 --> 17:51.520
I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.060
HAD ENOUGH OF ME YET?

17:55.060 --> 17:56.630
NO, YOU'RE STILL
MY BROTHER,

17:56.630 --> 17:59.260
EVEN IF YOU ARE
MAKING IT DIFFICULT
TO REMEMBER.

18:03.970 --> 18:06.640
WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY
TO GET THAT THING OFF HIM.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.300
IF YOU CAN
GET HIM INTO THE OPEN,

18:08.300 --> 18:10.970
MAYBE I COULD HIT THE THING
WITH MY LASER VISION.

18:10.970 --> 18:12.610
JUST BE CAREFUL
NOT TO HURT RIP, OK?

18:12.610 --> 18:15.510
IT'S NOT RIP
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

18:21.150 --> 18:22.550
HEY!

18:22.550 --> 18:23.990
NORMALLY
I DON'T HIT GIRLS,

18:23.990 --> 18:27.220
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M
NOT TOO NORMAL THESE DAYS.

18:30.130 --> 18:34.600
NOW, ACE!
TAKE THE SHOT!

18:34.600 --> 18:37.530
AAH!

18:38.070 --> 18:39.000
AAH!

18:39.000 --> 18:40.770
SO, UH, WHAT'S UP, DOC?

18:40.770 --> 18:44.840
HA! DEFINITELY NOT YOU.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.810
THE PARASITE'S
BEEN ATTACHED SO LONG,

18:49.810 --> 18:51.580
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE CAN GET IT OFF.

18:51.580 --> 18:54.780
I'M AFRAID
IT'S GOING NOWHERE
UNTIL IT WANTS TO LEAVE.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.850
OH, BOY.
MY PARENTS ARE GONNA FREAK!

18:56.850 --> 18:59.590
THEY FLIP OUT
WHEN I LEAVE MY ROOM A MESS.

19:02.430 --> 19:03.630
HEY, LITTLE FELLA.

19:03.630 --> 19:06.760
GIVE ME THAT AMIGO!
HA HA HA HA HA!

19:06.760 --> 19:10.830
DOUBLE THE DESTRUCTION,
DOUBLE THE FUN.

19:13.970 --> 19:16.270
OH, NO! THE SITUATION WAS
BAD ENOUGH WITH ONE AMIGO.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.240
NOW THERE ARE TWO!

19:17.240 --> 19:19.010
OK, THAT'S A CHALLENGE.

19:19.010 --> 19:20.810
HE'S UNSTOPPABLE!

19:20.810 --> 19:23.510
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY
WE CAN SCARE THAT ALIEN
GIZMO OFF OF HIM.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.950
NO, NO, NOT WE.
JUST ME!

19:25.950 --> 19:28.150
OK, LITTLE BROTHER,
YOU WANT A FIGHT,
YOU GOT A FIGHT.

19:28.150 --> 19:29.520
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.160
THIS IS GOING TO BE SWEET.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.390
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.

19:36.390 --> 19:38.790
I KNEW YOU WERE
TOO CHICKEN TO FIGHT.

19:38.790 --> 19:41.560
HEY! NO ONE CALLS
A ROADRUNNER CHICKEN.

19:45.930 --> 19:49.100
LET ME GO!

19:49.100 --> 19:50.940
HEY, ARE YOU CRAZY?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.110
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:52.110 --> 19:54.640
GETTING
MY LITTLE BROTHER BACK.

20:09.290 --> 20:10.630
THANKS, REV.

20:10.630 --> 20:12.600
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN
THOSE THINGS I SAID.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.030
YEAH, YOU DID,
BUT IT'S OK.

20:14.030 --> 20:16.470
I'M JUST SORRY I WASN'T
A BETTER LISTENER EARLIER.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.630
AFTER ALL THE THINGS
I DID TO YOU,

20:18.630 --> 20:20.270
YOU RISKED EVERYTHING
TO SAVE ME.

20:20.270 --> 20:22.170
HEY, FORGET ABOUT IT, RIP.
THAT'S WHAT BROTHERS DO.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.910
THEY LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

20:24.910 --> 20:25.910
SWEET-MEEP-MEEP!

20:25.910 --> 20:27.440
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A FENDER BENDER.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.080
MOM, POP, WHAT
ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

20:29.080 --> 20:31.380
WE SAW YOU BOYS ON TV
AND THOUGHT WE'D
COME DOWN TO SEE YA.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.520
I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS.

20:32.520 --> 20:33.880
I USED RIP'S
FIRST EDITION IDEA

20:33.880 --> 20:37.520
AND NOW THE ROBO AMIGO
IS BACK IN BUSINESS.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.520
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.
THE FIRST EDITION ROBO AMIGO

20:40.520 --> 20:41.860
IS SOARING IN VALUE.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.760
IT SEEMS THEY CAN'T KEEP
ENOUGH OF THEM IN STOCK.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.960
HEY, THAT'S MINE!

20:46.960 --> 20:48.300
HA HA HA HA.

20:48.300 --> 20:49.600
SUCKERS.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.900
WANNA PLAY ANOTHER GAME,

20:50.900 --> 20:54.470
O GREAT MAXIMUM LEADER
AND WONDROUS DUCK?

20:54.470 --> 20:57.010
HEH HEH. I TOLD YOU
TO STAY IN YOUR BOX.

20:57.010 --> 20:59.580
YOU'RE WORTH MORE
IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.640
SORRY.

21:11.190 --> 21:15.390
HERE, BOY.
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:15.390 --> 21:16.560
THERE YOU ARE!

21:16.560 --> 21:18.430
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.470
OH!

21:25.600 --> 21:30.170
KIDS. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

21:30.170 --> 21:34.440
OH, SPIKEY. I HOPE YOU'VE
BEEN STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE.
