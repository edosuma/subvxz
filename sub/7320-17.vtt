WEBVTT

00:12.667 --> 00:18.533
(siren wailing)

00:18.567 --> 00:19.467
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19.500 --> 00:22.067
I NEED BETADINE, SALINE
AND A SUTURE KIT.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.567
WHAT HAPPENED?
SHE CUT HERSELF.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.700
I'VE GOT THIS.
HOW MUCH BLOOD
HAS SHE LOST?

00:26.733 --> 00:28.100
ALEX...

00:28.133 --> 00:30.267
SHE'S FINE.
I'VE GOT THIS.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.500
(Derek) GIVEN THE SITUATION,
I WOULD UNDERSTAND

00:33.533 --> 00:36.233
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PROCEED
WITH THE SURGERY.

00:36.267 --> 00:39.167
BUT WE DID LEARN
FROM JEREMY,

00:39.200 --> 00:41.567
AND THE FORMULATION
OF THE VIRAL COCKTAIL

00:41.600 --> 00:45.133
WILL BE ADJUSTED.
WE HAVE NOT YET HAD
A POSITIVE OUTCOME.

00:45.167 --> 00:48.333
LIZ?
I WANT TO TAKE HER HOME.

00:48.367 --> 00:51.467
I UNDERSTAND.
NO. I WANT THE SURGERY.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.733
HONEY...

00:52.767 --> 00:55.600
HONEY,
THAT'S THE GRIEF TALKING.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.433
I WANT THE SURGERY TODAY.

00:57.467 --> 01:00.700
WELL, THERE ARE NO OTHER
CLINICAL TRIALS OUT THERE.

01:00.733 --> 01:03.333
NO ONE ELSE HAS ANY ANSWERS.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.067
DR. SHEPHERD HAS WORKED
VERY HARD ON THIS--
MEREDITH.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.200
WE'RE NOT LETTING YOU
HAVE THE SURGERY

01:08.233 --> 01:10.133
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DIE
WITH JEREMY.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.467
IF I GO HOME, I DIE.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.700
I DIE IN A FEW WEEKS,
A FEW DAYS.

01:16.733 --> 01:19.533
(crying)
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

01:20.867 --> 01:24.700
MOM... YOU WON'T...

01:24.733 --> 01:29.500
BECAUSE I'M NOT FINISHED.

01:29.533 --> 01:32.467
DADDY... HE LOVED ME.

01:32.500 --> 01:37.267
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
JEREMY REALLY LOVED ME.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.667
AND HE'D BE SO MAD
IF--IF I JUST GAVE UP.

01:43.467 --> 01:44.500
PLEASE...

01:44.533 --> 01:47.400
DO THE SURGERY TODAY.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.667
(laughing)
(clears throat) LOLA.
ANDREW'S ASKING FOR YOU.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.300
SO COULD YOU
COME WITH ME, PLEASE?
OOH, YEAH.

02:00.333 --> 02:02.200
(boys laughing)

02:02.233 --> 02:04.133
HEY, UM, IS, UH,
IS HE OKAY?

02:04.167 --> 02:08.233
NO, HE'S NOT OKAY. HE'S STUCK
IN A BLOCK OF CEMENT...

02:08.267 --> 02:10.167
ACTUAL HARDENING-BY-THE-SECOND,
CONCRETE CEMENT.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.500
HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY
BE OKAY?

02:14.700 --> 02:17.333
WOW. YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.333
HE'S MY FRIEND.

02:22.367 --> 02:24.800
I, UM, I KNOW
I TOLD YOU HE WASN'T,

02:24.833 --> 02:26.800
BUT HE'S MY FRIEND.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.700
I THINK HE'S MORE THAN THAT.

02:28.733 --> 02:32.533
AND I THINK YOU'RE TOO PROUD
TO ADMIT IT TO YOUR FRIENDS

02:32.567 --> 02:35.133
AND MAYBE EVEN TO YOURSELF.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.600
(boy imitating child)
MOMMY, I HAVE A BOO-BOO.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.767
KISS IT BETTER.
MWAH. MWAH.
(laughs)

02:39.800 --> 02:42.200
HEY, HE IS IN PAIN,
HE IS SCARED,

02:42.233 --> 02:46.300
AND HE NEEDS SOMEONE HE KNOWS
TO HOLD HIS HAND.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.300
LOLA. OH, LOLA.
HOLD MY HAND. PLEASE, LOLA.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.467
(lowered voice)
SCREW WHAT THEY THINK.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.533
THIS MATTERS. THEY DON'T.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.467
(boys laughing)

02:57.500 --> 02:59.800
I CAN'T HELP HIM.

03:02.867 --> 03:06.500
YOU'RE GONNA HATE YOURSELF
FOR THIS.

03:06.533 --> 03:09.600
LATER... YOU'RE GONNA
HATE YOURSELF FOR THIS,

03:09.633 --> 03:11.633
AND YOU'LL BE RIGHT.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.700
(sighs)

03:18.333 --> 03:19.400
I DON'T THINK
THIS LOOKS RIGHT.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.233
CRISTINA IS DYSLEXIC,

03:21.267 --> 03:22.500
BUT SHE GOT STRAIGHT A's
ALL DURING MED SCHOOL

03:22.533 --> 03:24.333
AND SHE HAS A PhD.
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

03:24.367 --> 03:26.167
EIGHT LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION
IN HER FILE.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.300
DOES THIS LOOK RIGHT? IS THIS
HOW IT WAS WHEN YOU FOUND 'EM?
IZZIE WENT TO COLLEGE AT NIGHT.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.833
IT TOOK HER SIX YEARS
TO GRADUATE,

03:31.867 --> 03:33.600
AND SHE VOLUNTEERED
AS A CANDY STRIPER.

03:33.633 --> 03:36.667
PATIENTS WROTE
HER LETTERS OF REC.
WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE
BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES US.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.600
(clattering)

03:38.633 --> 03:40.600
AND ALEX--HE WROTE
THIS ESSAY TO GET IN,

03:40.633 --> 03:43.100
THIS MOVING, BEAUTIFUL ESSAY
ABOUT HOW HIS GRADES

03:43.133 --> 03:45.067
WEREN'T THAT GOOD
DURING MED SCHOOL

03:45.067 --> 03:47.300
BECAUSE HE WAS SUFFERING
FROM TESTICULAR CANCER.
WHAT? OW! WHAT?

03:47.333 --> 03:49.233
HE SAID HE LOST A BALL.
(gasps)

03:49.267 --> 03:51.267
BUT I'VE SEEN HIM NAKED.
HE HAS TWO MANGERINES, GEORGE,

03:51.300 --> 03:53.733
TWO POUCH POTATOES.
HE LIED. HE'S A LIAR.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.667
STOP TELLING ME INFORMATION
I DON'T WANNA KNOW.
ONE POINT. JUST ONE POINT.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.800
HOW CAN THEY KEEP YOU BACK
FOR ONE POINT?

03:57.833 --> 04:00.733
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.
PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.
I CAN'T.

04:00.767 --> 04:02.667
WE'LL GET IT RIGHT
WITH BETH.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.433
SHE JUST LOST
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE.

04:04.467 --> 04:07.467
HOW COULD YOU ENCOURAGE HER
TO DO THE SURGERY?
HOW COULD YOU
ENCOURAGE HER NOT TO?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.400
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ME
WITH THE BIG EGO, IT'S YOU.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.367
YOU BACKED ME
INTO A CORNER THERE.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.067
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
SAY NO?
DEREK--

04:12.100 --> 04:13.333
I CAN'T. SHE'S A KID.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.600
SHE'S A KID WHO'S GONNA DIE
WITHOUT THE SURGERY.

04:15.633 --> 04:16.700
SHE'LL DIE WITH THE SURGERY.

04:16.733 --> 04:19.133
THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I
DO TOGETHER, WE KILL THINGS

04:19.167 --> 04:21.067
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.833
WE'VE KILLED 12 PEOPLE,
AND NOW BECAUSE OF YOU,

04:22.867 --> 04:24.500
I WILL KILL A 13th.

04:24.533 --> 04:26.433
WHEN BETH'S SURGERY'S OVER,
WE'RE DONE.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.700
I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH YOU,
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU,

04:28.733 --> 04:31.600
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
WE'RE DONE.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.167
OKAY, ANDY,
WE'RE READY TO BEGIN.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.567
OH, WAIT.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.433
UH, IS SHE... LOLA?

04:50.467 --> 04:52.367
UH, SHE--
I COULDN'T FIND HER.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.700
UH, SHE WENT TO EAT
OR SOMETHING.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.300
(Miranda) WE NEED TO START
THE CATHETER.

04:56.333 --> 04:59.800
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE GONNA
FEEL SOME PRESSURE.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.167
SHE DIDN'T GO TO EAT.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.100
SHE JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO COME, RIGHT?

05:04.133 --> 05:05.333
AH.

05:05.367 --> 05:08.667
LOLA LIKES TO HANG OUT
WITH ME.

05:08.700 --> 05:10.633
OR SHE DID--

05:10.667 --> 05:11.833
USED TO--

05:11.867 --> 05:14.233
BEFORE I DID THIS.

05:14.267 --> 05:16.433
ONCE, SHE ALMOST...

05:16.467 --> 05:20.300
THERE, UH, COULDA BEEN
A KISS,

05:20.333 --> 05:22.200
BUT I... CHICKENED OUT.

05:22.233 --> 05:25.200
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T
NEED TO BE KISSING HER.

05:25.233 --> 05:28.100
NO, I DO. (chuckles) I DO.
I DO NEED TO BE KISSING HER.

05:28.133 --> 05:30.067
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS ABOUT KISSING HER.

05:30.067 --> 05:34.067
(Miranda) OKAY, CATHETER'S IN.
THE GUYS ARE ON
THEIR LAST PIECE OF CEMENT.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.600
(Andrew groans)

05:35.633 --> 05:37.533
THANK GOD.
THE HARD PART'S OVER.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.800
RIGHT? THE HARD PART'S OVER?
YANG,
GET A CRASH CART READY.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.400
ALL RIGHT,
I'VE GOT CALCIUM...

05:43.433 --> 05:45.433
D50 AND INSULIN.

05:45.467 --> 05:46.400
READY.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.800
THE HARD PART IS OVER?

05:48.833 --> 05:51.833
OKAY, UM, THERE IS A CHANCE

05:51.867 --> 05:53.767
THAT WHEN THE NICE GENTLEMEN

05:53.800 --> 05:55.633
TAKE OFF
THE FINAL PIECE OF CEMENT

05:55.667 --> 05:58.533
THERE ON YOUR ABDOMEN,
ALL THE TOXINS THAT HAVE BEEN

05:58.567 --> 06:00.500
BUILDING UP UNDERNEATH
THE CONCRETE

06:00.533 --> 06:02.433
WILL RUSH TO YOUR HEART,

06:02.467 --> 06:03.633
AND YOU'LL CRASH.

06:03.667 --> 06:07.500
AND YOU--YOUR HEART WILL STOP
AND YOU'LL STOP BREATHING.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.233
UM, BUT NO, THERE'S NO NEED
TO MAKE THAT FACE

06:10.267 --> 06:12.167
BECAUSE WE WILL
RESTART YOUR HEART,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.433
AND WE WILL PUT IN A TUBE
THAT WILL BREATHE FOR YOU

06:15.467 --> 06:17.367
AND R--AND RUSH YOU
RIGHT TO THE O.R., OKAY?

06:17.400 --> 06:19.567
WE ARE GOOD AT WHAT WE DO.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.500
JUST, IF YOU SEE
THE WARM, WELCOMING LIGHT,

06:21.533 --> 06:24.067
DO NOT GO INTO IT.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.667
(chuckles and whimpers)

06:26.700 --> 06:28.400
LET'S GO.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.500
(Richard) OKAY,
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS ON THREE.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.567
OKAY, ONE...
ALL RIGHT,
WATCH THE LEADS.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.800
TWO...

06:36.833 --> 06:38.067
OH.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.167
THREE.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.233
OH, OH.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.633
(Richard) OKAY.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.633
THERE HE GOES.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.100
(Mark)
CLEAR HIS AIRWAY.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.667
(monitor beeping erratically)

06:49.700 --> 06:51.567
(Richard) ALL RIGHT.
(Erica) IT'S IN.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.400
ONE, TWO... THREE.

06:54.433 --> 06:57.267
EASY, EASY, EASY.
(Erica) WATCH HIS HEAD.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.133
(Callie) PUSH THE LIDOCAINE,
VEC AND VERSED.
(Richard) BAILEY.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.800
(Miranda) GOT THE INTUBATION.
GO.

07:02.833 --> 07:06.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN

07:06.700 --> 07:07.800
WHEN YOU SAY
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.500
WHEN YOU WERE SITTING
ON THE FLOOR WITH YOUR MOTHER,

07:10.533 --> 07:13.367
WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.833
SHE TOLD ME
TO BE EXTRAORDINARY.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.767
SHE SAID
THAT SHE HAD FAILED,

07:16.800 --> 07:18.100
BUT THAT I SHOULD BE
EXTRAORDINARY,

07:18.133 --> 07:21.367
THAT I SHOULDN'T DEPEND
ON ANYONE.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.500
"BE AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN,
MEREDITH," IS WHAT SHE SAID.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.267
AND SO YOU BECAME A SURGEON,
JUST LIKE HER.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.133
YES.
WHICH MEANS
YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS

07:30.167 --> 07:32.200
TO FIGURE THIS OUT
FOR YOURSELF.
BUT I JUST--

07:32.233 --> 07:34.133
YOU NEED TO
WORK THIS THROUGH, MEREDITH.

07:34.167 --> 07:37.633
I PROMISE YOU, WHEN YOU DO,
YOU'RE GONNA BE GLAD.

07:45.567 --> 07:47.500
(sighs)

07:50.200 --> 07:54.300
MY HEAD IS EXPLODING.
MAKE IT UNEXPLODE.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.100
ARE... ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

07:57.133 --> 07:59.600
NO.
THEN WHY ARE YOU
TALKING TO ME IN THAT VOICE?

07:59.633 --> 08:00.800
THERE'S NO VOICE.
THERE'S A VOICE...

08:00.833 --> 08:03.667
AND I DID YOU A FAVOR.
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO ME A FAVOR.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.500
YOU JUST MADE IT CLEAR THAT
I'M STILL ME--THE ALMOST GUY.

08:06.533 --> 08:08.433
ALL THAT SEPARATES ME
FROM THE REST OF MY CLASS

08:08.467 --> 08:10.367
IS ONE POINT, ONE POINT?

08:10.400 --> 08:12.833
I MEAN, IT WOULD'VE BEEN OKAY
IF IT WAS 50 POINTS

08:12.867 --> 08:14.767
OR EVEN TEN POINTS,
BUT ONE?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.133
THAT MEANS IT WAS RIGHT THERE,
IT WAS IN MY HAND,

08:16.167 --> 08:18.067
AND I LET IT SLIP AWAY.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.200
IT--I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT.
DO YOU GET THAT?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.133
THAT KNOWING
THAT IF I HAD JUST,

08:22.167 --> 08:24.067
WHAT, CHECKED "A"
INSTEAD OF "B," THAT...

08:24.100 --> 08:26.533
THAT THAT ONE POINT
SEPARATES ME FROM FREEDOM...

08:26.567 --> 08:29.200
I HAVE BEEN RUNNING
MY TAIL OFF, BUSTING MY ASS

08:29.233 --> 08:31.500
TO MAKE UP FOR ONE
LOUSY POINT,

08:31.533 --> 08:34.267
PROVING...

08:34.300 --> 08:39.200
YOU DIDN'T DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

08:39.233 --> 08:44.100
WELL, AT LEAST...

08:44.133 --> 08:46.667
NOW YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.067
YEAH.

08:51.233 --> 08:53.133
THIS ARM'S ALMOST BANDAGED,

08:53.167 --> 08:56.400
THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE
TO THE OTHER ONE, OKAY?
OKAY.

08:56.433 --> 08:58.400
I'VE PRESCRIBED HER
ALPRAZOLAM AND CLONAZEPAM.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.333
PSYCH WILL BE DOWN
WITHIN AN HOUR,

09:00.367 --> 09:02.067
BUT I THOUGHT IT'D BE GOOD

09:02.100 --> 09:05.067
TO HAVE SOMETHING TO KEEP HER
CALM UNTIL THEY GET HERE.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.567
SHE DOESN'T NEED ANY DRUGS
OR ANY PSYCH.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.533
SHE NEEDS A PSYCH CONSULT
TO BE ADMITTED.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.833
LOOK, I'M NOT ADMITTING HER.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING HER HOME.

09:11.867 --> 09:14.667
I WAS WATCHING HER EVERY MINUTE
UNTIL YOU CALLED.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
WATCH HER EVERY MINUTE.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.233
YOU'RE NOT ON TODAY, SO SHE
WAS ADMITTED UNDER MY NAME,

09:17.267 --> 09:18.700
WHICH MEANS I GET TO DECIDE
THE TREATMENT PLAN.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.600
SHE NEEDS TO BE PUT
ON A HOLD SO--
DAMN IT!

09:20.633 --> 09:23.200
WOULD YOU LEAVE US ALONE,
YOU STUPID BITCH?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.400
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
SITTING DOWN.

09:39.433 --> 09:40.500
THAT'S WHAT
THE BREAKS ARE FOR.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.433
WE'VE BEEN ON OUR FEET
OVER NINE HOURS.

09:42.467 --> 09:44.467
REST YOUR LEGS.
MY LEGS ARE GOOD.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.300
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE,
DON'T YOU THINK,

09:47.333 --> 09:48.367
THINKING ABOUT SEX
DURING SURGERY?

09:48.400 --> 09:51.233
I'M JUST SAYING WHAT I'VE
BEEN WITNESSING ALL DAY.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.700
THIS POOR KID'S ENTIRE BODY
WAS ENCASED IN CEMENT.

09:53.733 --> 09:54.767
HIS LEGS ARE CRUSHED,

09:54.800 --> 09:57.067
HIS VESSELS AND NERVES
NEARLY CUT OFF COMPLETELY,

09:57.067 --> 09:59.333
AND STILL...
I WAS TURNED ON.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.267
(clicks tongue)
THIS ENTIRE TIME,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.333
I'VE BEEN TURNED ON
BECAUSE OF YOU

10:03.367 --> 10:06.100
AND YOUR DIRTY TALK.
IT WASN'T MY DIRTY TALK.

10:06.133 --> 10:08.033
IT'S WHAT I WAS
DIRTY TALKING ABOUT.

10:08.067 --> 10:09.133
WHAT?

10:09.167 --> 10:11.067
ERICA. YOU AND ERICA.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.367
(scoffs) NO.
THAT'S... NO.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.300
CALLIE...
WHAT?

10:15.333 --> 10:16.633
IT'S OKAY.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.600
I WISH I WAS
ALL SOMEONE THOUGHT ABOUT.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.467
YOU HAD 14 LETTERS
OF RECOMMENDATION.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.633
CRISTINA HAD EIGHT,
MEREDITH HAD FOUR,

10:35.667 --> 10:37.567
IZZIE HAD 10,
BUT YOU HAD 14.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.300
AND THE WORDS THAT THEY USED
TO DESCRIBE YOU--

10:40.333 --> 10:42.233
NOBODY HAD RECOMMENDATIONS
LIKE YOURS.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.167
PEOPLE SAID THE OTHERS
WERE SMART,

10:44.200 --> 10:46.100
THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE
HARD WORKERS,

10:46.133 --> 10:48.500
THEY SAID
THAT THEY WERE GOOD.

10:48.533 --> 10:51.167
BUT YOUR LETTERS?
THEY SAID YOU WERE GREAT.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.333
THEY SPOKE OF YOUR KINDNESS,
YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

10:53.367 --> 10:55.267
THEY TALKED ABOUT
HOW HARD YOU TRY

10:55.300 --> 10:57.200
AND THAT YOU NEVER GIVE UP.

10:57.233 --> 10:59.700
THEY PAINTED A PICTURE
OF THE KIND OF DOCTOR

10:59.733 --> 11:01.167
THAT I HOPE TO BECOME.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.233
IT WAS AN HONOR
TO READ THOSE LETTERS

11:03.267 --> 11:05.067
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW

11:05.067 --> 11:06.800
THAT WHAT SEPARATES YOU
FROM THE OTHERS

11:06.833 --> 11:08.733
ISN'T ONE STUPID POINT.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.233
WHAT SEPARATES YOU
FROM THE OTHERS IS GREATNESS.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.433
SO DON'T YOU DARE
LET ONE POINT

11:13.467 --> 11:15.533
HOLD YOU BACK.

11:26.133 --> 11:29.500
OKAY, I'M COVERED IN BLOOD.
TALK FAST.

11:29.533 --> 11:32.567
ALEX BROUGHT REBECCA IN.
SHE TRIED TO HURT HERSELF.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.433
AND NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT
TAKING REBECCA HOME.
AND?

11:34.467 --> 11:37.633
SHE NEEDS TO BE ADMITTED.
SHE NEEDS A PSYCH CONSULT.
AND?

11:37.667 --> 11:40.233
CAN YOU JUST DO YOUR JOB?
I AM DOING MY JOB.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.600
I'M SORRY.
I'M HELPING A 19-YEAR-OLD MAN

11:42.633 --> 11:45.067
THAT I PROMISED WOULD GET
TO LIVE GET TO LIVE.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.100
THAT'S MY JOB AS A SURGEON.

11:47.133 --> 11:49.067
I TOOK MY SON TO DAY CARE
WHEN I CAME IN.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.800
THAT'S MY JOB AS A MOTHER.

11:50.833 --> 11:52.733
AND I'M STANDING HERE
ASKING YOU,

11:52.767 --> 11:54.567
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT YOUR PATIENT?

11:54.600 --> 11:56.500
THAT'S MY JOB
AS CHIEF RESIDENT.

11:56.533 --> 11:59.400
NOW HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOUR JOB?
I CAN'T.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:59.433 --> 12:03.167
STEVENS. SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.
HE'S...

12:03.200 --> 12:05.333
HER LOVED ONE.

12:05.367 --> 12:09.067
COME ON, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
IT'S JUST HARD TO DO IT.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.700
OKAY, I'LL TRY.

12:10.733 --> 12:12.633
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRY.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.567
YOU'RE A DOCTOR
TRAINED BY ME,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.567
WITH ALL THE SKILLS
THAT GOD GAVE YOU.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.600
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.300
EACH ONE TEACH ONE.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.567
WHERE ARE WE?

12:26.600 --> 12:29.167
SLOAN, HAHN AND TORRES
ARE DONE. WE'RE UP.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.533
WE JUST UNCLAMPED
THE PORTAL VEIN.

12:31.567 --> 12:34.133
BLOOD FLOW IS GOOD TO THE LIVER.
UH, RIGHT, CHIEF?

12:34.167 --> 12:35.767
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
GOOD JOB.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.300
(Miranda)
GOOD, THEN WE'RE READY TO--

12:38.333 --> 12:41.100
(monitor beeps erratically)

12:48.800 --> 12:50.567
OH.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.500
I THINK I LIKED IT BETTER

12:52.533 --> 12:54.433
WHEN YOU WERE SAYING
BORING SCIENCE STUFF.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.267
HMM.

12:58.467 --> 13:01.800
I'M NEVER GOOD ENOUGH...

13:01.833 --> 13:06.433
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY
OR WHAT I DO.

13:06.467 --> 13:10.433
I NEVER WANTED TO DO THIS.

13:10.467 --> 13:13.733
THIS CLINICAL TRIAL
IS MAKING ME A FAILURE.

13:16.267 --> 13:18.267
I FAIL HER OVER...

13:18.300 --> 13:20.767
AND OVER...

13:20.800 --> 13:23.067
AND OVER.

13:24.867 --> 13:28.600
YOU MEAN "THEM."

13:28.633 --> 13:32.600
WHEN YOU SAY, "FAIL HER,"
YOU MEAN "FAIL THEM"...

13:32.633 --> 13:35.500
THE PATIENTS.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.567
(sighs)

13:46.067 --> 13:48.767
(monitor beeping erratically)

13:48.800 --> 13:50.733
HE'S GONNA NEED AN EMBOLECTOMY.
CALL HAHN BACK HERE.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.667
A CLOT IN THE RIGHT
PULMONARY ARTERY.

13:52.700 --> 13:56.100
IT'S PRETTY MASSIVE.
I COULD GET TO IT
WITH A THORACOTOMY.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.267
UH, HAHN WILL ASSESS HIM
WHEN SHE GETS HERE.
I CAN GET TO IT.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.500
THE LUNG
AUTOMATICALLY RETRACTS,

13:59.533 --> 14:01.567
LEAVING THE AREA
FOR EMBOLECTOMY CLEAR.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.133
HE'S ALREADY
SEVERELY COMPROMISED.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.467
WE'D WASTE TIME
SETTING UP BYPASS,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.067
TIME HIS BRAIN
WON'T BE PERFUSING.

14:08.067 --> 14:10.333
IT'LL TAKE ME SECONDS.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE...

14:10.367 --> 14:12.067
WITH BURKE.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.800
I PROMISED THIS KID
HE WOULD LIVE.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.100
(beeping continues)

14:16.133 --> 14:18.200
DR. BAILEY,
TAKE OVER C.P.R.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.800
YANG... I'M RIGHT HERE
IF YOU NEED ME.

14:20.833 --> 14:24.067
(beeping continues)

14:25.467 --> 14:28.167
10-BLADE.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.200
(beeping continues)

14:41.733 --> 14:44.467
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.233
COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU,
SCARED?

14:47.267 --> 14:48.533
YES.

14:51.167 --> 14:52.700
ME, TOO.

14:52.733 --> 14:56.067
SO LET'S JUST... LEAP.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.067
OKAY?

14:59.100 --> 15:01.700
OKAY.

15:08.767 --> 15:11.333
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:11.367 --> 15:13.633
(door opens)

15:13.667 --> 15:16.300
WHAT IS IT? WHAT HAPPENED?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.633
HE THREW A P.E.
SO WHAT,
YOU DECIDED YANG WOULD BE

15:17.667 --> 15:19.067
THE BEST PERSON
TO OPEN HIM UP?
SHE'S A BIT OF
A CARDIAC SAVANT

15:19.067 --> 15:21.600
IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED.
OH, REALLY? IS THAT
WHY SHE WENT THROUGH

15:21.633 --> 15:24.133
THE FOURTH INTERCOSTAL SPACE
INSTEAD OF THE FIFTH?
COULDN'T GET IN
THROUGH THE FIFTH

15:24.167 --> 15:26.100
BECAUSE THERE'S GAUZE
PUSHING UP THE DIAPHRAGM

15:26.133 --> 15:28.267
FROM THE ABDOMINAL SURGERY.
THIS COULD BE EASIER IF YOU
DID IT UNDER FLUORO.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.700
ALREADY HAD THE T.E.E. HERE.
I'M DOING JUST FINE WITH IT.

15:30.733 --> 15:33.067
BUT YOU COULD REACH IT BETTER
IF--ALL RIGHT, FORGET IT.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.067
I'LL DO IT MYSELF.
GOWN, PLEASE.
I'VE GOT THIS.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.733
NO, IF YOU HAD DONE IT--
JUST SHUT UP AND LET ME WORK.

15:38.767 --> 15:42.233
LET HER WORK, DR. HAHN.

15:42.267 --> 15:44.600
(beeping continues)

15:55.300 --> 15:57.233
SHEPHERD SCHEDULED
TWO CRANIOTOMIES

15:57.267 --> 15:59.367
FOR THE CLINICAL TRIAL
TODAY?

15:59.400 --> 16:01.467
YES, WE LOST THE FIRST ONE,
BUT THE SECOND ONE...

16:01.500 --> 16:04.767
I TOLD MEREDITH ONE PATIENT.
DR. GREY SAID
SHE CLEARED IT WITH YOU.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.833
DID SHE?

16:06.867 --> 16:11.067
I...
SIR, I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN.

16:11.067 --> 16:14.167
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.667
(Meredith)
SHE'S HOLDING STEADY.

16:18.700 --> 16:21.167
THE I.C.P.'s 13.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.700
WE'LL SEE.

16:22.733 --> 16:24.433
DEREK...

16:24.467 --> 16:26.367
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.467
WE'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.400
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

16:30.433 --> 16:32.067
FOR HOW LONG?

16:32.100 --> 16:33.700
YOU CAN GO.

16:33.733 --> 16:35.233
I'LL STAY WITH HER.

16:35.267 --> 16:37.633
NO, IT'S JUST...

16:37.667 --> 16:40.067
I'LL DO IT. YOU CAN GO.

16:55.233 --> 16:58.233
(sighs)

16:58.267 --> 17:01.767
YANG FLEW SOLO,
AND YOU SHOULD BE CELEBRATING

17:01.800 --> 17:04.800
BECAUSE THAT MEANS
YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB--

17:04.833 --> 17:07.200
TEACHING HER
HOW TO SAVE A LIFE.

17:07.233 --> 17:11.533
RESIDENTS ARE LIKE...
PUPPIES,

17:11.567 --> 17:13.233
EAGER AND ENTHUSIASTIC,

17:13.267 --> 17:15.167
AND YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO TEACH

17:15.200 --> 17:16.800
WITHOUT CRUSHING THEIR SPIRIT.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.200
NOW YOU WANT TO WORK HERE
WITH MY RESIDENTS,

17:19.233 --> 17:21.833
THEN YOU NEED TO DO BETTER.

17:21.867 --> 17:24.700
YOU NEED TO BE
A BETTER TEACHER.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.500
(sighs)

17:39.267 --> 17:42.067
DON'T MAKE ME REGRET
BACKING YOU UP.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.333
NO, SIR.
ABSOLUTELY NOT, SIR.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.133
THANK YOU, SIR.

17:46.167 --> 17:49.533
PUPPIES.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.200
REBECCA...

17:56.233 --> 17:57.567
THIS IS DR. SHAPIRO
FROM PSYCH.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.367
HE'S GONNA BE EXAMINING YOU.
IZ--

17:59.400 --> 18:01.300
HE'S GONNA ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS

18:01.333 --> 18:03.467
WHILE DR. KAREV AND I TALK.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.300
ALEX?

18:14.367 --> 18:17.833
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
SHE'S MY PATIENT.
I DECIDE HER TREATMENT PLAN.

18:17.867 --> 18:19.767
I AM NOT RELEASING HER
WITHOUT A CONSULT.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.467
IF YOU TRY TO TAKE HER
OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL

18:22.500 --> 18:24.067
WITHOUT MY OKAY,

18:24.067 --> 18:25.367
I WILL CALL THE POLICE
AND HAVE YOU ARRESTED.
YOU CAN'T HAVE ME ARRESTED.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.233
TRY ME.
LOOK, IZ, YOU'RE WORRIED.
I SEE THAT, AND I UNDERSTAND.

18:28.267 --> 18:32.133
BUT YOU'RE--YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE UNREASONABLE.

18:32.167 --> 18:34.767
I'VE GOT THIS.
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE IT.
I HAVE IT.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.200
I'M TAKING HER HOME.
NO. NO!

18:37.233 --> 18:39.700
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA
BODILY RESTRAIN ME?

18:39.733 --> 18:42.300
I WILL IF I HAVE TO.
ARE YOU GONNA HIT A WOMAN?
I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

18:42.333 --> 18:47.200
ALEX, SHE'S SICK. SHE NEEDS HELP
YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY GIVE HER.

18:47.233 --> 18:49.133
I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.267
NO, YOU CAN'T. YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.200
YOU COULD DO MORE DAMAGE
BY TAKING HER HOME.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.733
LOOK, I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.500
ALEX--
SHE'S JUST GOING THROUGH
A BAD PATCH.

18:58.533 --> 18:59.700
PEOPLE GO THROUGH
A BAD PATCH.

18:59.733 --> 19:01.633
ALL RIGHT? I...
I-I-I CAN FEED HER

19:01.667 --> 19:03.567
AND I CAN--I CAN CHANGE HER

19:03.600 --> 19:06.333
AND I CAN BATHE HER
AND I CAN WATCH HER.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.200
UNTIL THE BAD PATCH IS OVER,
I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.

19:08.233 --> 19:11.233
LOOK, I TOOK CARE OF MY MOM,
AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF HER.

19:11.267 --> 19:14.167
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.700
I HAVE
DONE THIS BEFORE, IZZIE.

19:17.733 --> 19:20.600
BUT I WAS A KID THEN,
AND I'M A MAN NOW,

19:20.633 --> 19:21.600
SO I'LL BE BETTER AT IT.

19:21.633 --> 19:23.433
I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE.

19:23.467 --> 19:26.167
STOP. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY ANYMORE.

20:16.633 --> 20:17.800
YOU'RE HERE EARLY.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.500
I NEVER WENT HOME.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.433
I KNEW YOU'D WANT
TO MONITOR YOUR PATIENT.

20:21.467 --> 20:24.367
AND I FIGURED YOU WERE
TIRED AFTER SURGERY, SO...
MM-HMM. HOW IS HE?

20:24.400 --> 20:25.567
HIS VITALS ARE STABLE.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.033
HE RECEIVED 16 LITERS
OVER THE FIRST 24 HOURS.

20:29.067 --> 20:31.467
I CHANGED IT DOWN
TO 125 cc's PER HOUR.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.767
HIS URINE OUTPUT'S GOOD
AT 37 cc's PER HOUR.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.700
HE HAD SOME ANXIETY
AT 3:00 A.M.,

20:35.733 --> 20:37.633
AND THEN AGAIN AT 5:00 A.M.,

20:37.667 --> 20:39.567
WHICH I TREATED
WITH DIPHENHYDRAMINE.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.800
YEAH, GOOD. GOOD JOB.

20:41.833 --> 20:45.433
(scoffs) IT'S NOT
A GOOD JOB.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.467
O'MALLEY?

20:47.500 --> 20:51.267
IT'S NOT A GOOD JOB
FOR ME.

20:51.300 --> 20:54.333
SITTING BY HIS BEDSIDE
RECORDING URINE OUTPUT

20:54.367 --> 20:58.067
AND GIVING ANTIANXIETY MEDS
ALL NIGHT...

20:58.100 --> 20:59.833
IT'S NOT A GOOD JOB FOR ME.

20:59.867 --> 21:03.567
RUNNING LABS FOR MEREDITH GREY,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD JOB FOR ME.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.100
IT'S NOT A GOOD JOB FOR ME
BECAUSE I'M BETTER THAN THAT,

21:06.133 --> 21:08.067
AND YOU KNOW
I'M BETTER THAN THAT.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.367
MAYBE IF I WASN'T GOOD
AT MY JOB

21:10.400 --> 21:14.233
OR MAYBE IF I HAD STRUGGLED
AND WAS LAGGING BEHIND...

21:14.267 --> 21:18.167
MY PERSONALITY--
I'M NOT KAREV, I'M NOT YANG,

21:18.200 --> 21:20.100
I'M NOT MEREDITH--

21:20.133 --> 21:22.767
I'M NOT HARDENED,
I GET THAT.

21:22.800 --> 21:27.100
I GET IT. I DON'T HAVE
THE PERSONALITY OF A SURGEON.

21:27.133 --> 21:29.833
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU MADE THE MISTAKE

21:29.867 --> 21:32.733
OF NOT THINKING THAT I DESERVE
A SECOND CHANCE

21:32.767 --> 21:35.600
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE
AROUND HERE HAS GOTTEN ONE,

21:35.633 --> 21:39.133
BUT, SIR, IT IS A MISTAKE
BECAUSE I'M EXCELLENT.

21:39.167 --> 21:39.833
I'M EXCELLENT AT MY JOB.

21:39.867 --> 21:41.833
AND I DID FAIL MY TEST,

21:41.867 --> 21:44.800
BUT I DESERVE
A SECOND CHANCE.

21:51.133 --> 21:53.800
OKAY.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.767
OKAY?

21:56.800 --> 22:00.600
OKAY, YOU CAN RETAKE
THE TEST.

22:03.233 --> 22:05.200
(exhales)

22:05.233 --> 22:06.600
OKAY.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.233
SHE HASN'T WOKEN UP YET.

22:09.267 --> 22:11.333
SOMETIMES IT TAKES LONGER
WITH BRAIN SURGERY

22:11.367 --> 22:13.667
FOR THE BODY TO RECOVER.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.833
BUT SHE COULD NOT
WAKE UP?

22:16.867 --> 22:19.733
COULD SHE DIE?
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY,

22:19.767 --> 22:21.667
BUT I'D RATHER NOT
WORRY ABOUT THAT

22:21.700 --> 22:24.400
UNTIL WE HAVE TO.
WHEN?

22:24.433 --> 22:27.433
WHEN WHAT?

22:27.467 --> 22:31.533
WHEN WILL WE... HAVE TO START
WORRYING ABOUT THAT?

22:42.600 --> 22:43.767
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.233
WHAT, DID YOU SLEEP
IN THE WAITING ROOM?

22:45.267 --> 22:48.100
LOOK, I LIKE HIM.
ALL RIGHT, I DO.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.367
BUT HE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.067
NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW THAT.
HE NEEDS YOU,

22:52.067 --> 22:55.200
AND YOU'RE TOO WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT YOUR FRIENDS THINK?
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

22:55.233 --> 22:58.200
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'D BE LIKE
FOR ME, FOR HIM, IF THEY KNEW?

22:58.233 --> 23:01.100
YOU THINK IT'S EASY?

23:01.133 --> 23:03.267
I THINK IT'S BETTER
TO BE HONEST.

23:06.067 --> 23:08.233
HE'S ALIVE.

23:08.267 --> 23:10.400
BARELY, BUT...

23:10.433 --> 23:12.633
HE'S ALIVE.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.167
I, UH, CALLED YOUR HUSBAND.

23:21.200 --> 23:27.233
HE SAYS HE TOOK THE BABY
AND LEFT YOU TWO MONTHS AGO.

23:27.267 --> 23:29.500
HE SAYS...

23:39.333 --> 23:41.233
YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED

23:41.267 --> 23:44.167
UNDERLYING BORDERLINE
PERSONALITY DISORDER,

23:44.200 --> 23:46.100
WHICH MEANS YOU WERE
FRAGILE TO START WITH,

23:46.133 --> 23:47.700
SO THIS...

23:47.733 --> 23:51.067
THIS HAS PROBABLY
BEEN COMING ON FOR A WHILE.

23:51.067 --> 23:54.567
PROBABLY SINCE YOUR--
YOUR ACCIDENT.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.633
WHEN THEY CHANGED
YOUR FACE...

23:57.667 --> 24:01.600
I HELPED CHANGE YOUR FACE...

24:01.633 --> 24:03.633
YOU COULDN'T...

24:07.433 --> 24:11.433
YOU NEED HELP, REBECCA,
AND I CAN'T GIVE IT TO YOU.

24:15.067 --> 24:17.100
SO YOU'RE GONNA
STAY HERE TONIGHT,

24:17.133 --> 24:19.100
AND TOMORROW...

24:20.800 --> 24:22.700
TOMORROW, THEY'RE GONNA
TRANSFER YOU

24:22.733 --> 24:26.067
TO A PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.

24:26.067 --> 24:27.800
I THINK THAT'S BETTER.

24:27.833 --> 24:30.467
(whispering) OH.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.733
I'M SORRY.

24:32.767 --> 24:35.367
I...

24:37.300 --> 24:40.167
I REALLY TRIED.

24:40.200 --> 24:44.100
I WANTED TO BE BETTER
FOR YOU.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.267
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR YOU TO TRUST PEOPLE,

24:49.300 --> 24:53.500
AND I WANTED TO BE SOMEONE
YOU COULD DEPEND ON.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.067
I'M SORRY.

24:57.733 --> 25:00.200
I'M SORRY.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.167
IT'S OKAY.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.767
YOU TRIED.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.667
SO YOU CONVINCED SHEPHERD
TO DO THE SECOND SURGERY

25:12.700 --> 25:14.167
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.433
SO?

25:15.467 --> 25:17.267
SO?

25:18.467 --> 25:22.267
THAT'S HOW YOU SPEAK
TO THE CHIEF, "SO"?

25:22.300 --> 25:25.633
MY MOTHER TRIED TO KILL HERSELF
AFTER YOU LEFT.

25:25.667 --> 25:29.267
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.600
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.733
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW. I--

25:35.767 --> 25:37.667
SHE WAS A BRILLIANT SURGEON.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.567
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
TO HER?

25:40.600 --> 25:47.433
SHE WAS A TALENTED,
GIFTED, EXTRAORDINARY SURGEON.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.767
MEREDITH?

25:59.767 --> 26:01.700
TELL ME.

26:01.733 --> 26:05.067
SHE WAS A SURGEON.
SHE WAS AN EXCELLENT SURGEON.

26:05.067 --> 26:06.800
IF SHE WAS REALLY TRYING
TO KILL HERSELF,

26:06.833 --> 26:08.733
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE SLIT
HER WRISTS.

26:08.767 --> 26:09.967
SHE KNEW BETTER.

26:10.067 --> 26:13.167
SHE WOULD'VE TAKEN THE SCALPEL
AND CUT HER CAROTID ARTERY.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.100
IT WOULD'VE TAKEN SECONDS
TO DIE.

26:15.133 --> 26:17.067
SHE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO DIE.

26:17.067 --> 26:18.800
SHE WAS AN EXCELLENT, GIFTED,
EXTRAORDINARY SURGEON.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.067
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE.
WHAT DID SHE WANT?

26:21.067 --> 26:22.800
SHE WANTED RICHARD
TO COME BACK TO HER.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.733
AND WHY DIDN'T HE COME BACK?

26:24.767 --> 26:27.067
WELL, BECAUSE...
HE NEVER KNEW ABOUT IT,

26:27.067 --> 26:29.733
AND SHE WAS TOO STUBBORN
TO ASK.

26:29.767 --> 26:33.067
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WELL... THAT PART
I DON'T KNOW.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.733
COULD YOU JUST TELL ME
THAT PART FOR ONCE?

26:35.767 --> 26:37.267
I CAN.

26:37.300 --> 26:39.600
IT MEANS
THAT YOU ARE A GIFTED,

26:39.633 --> 26:41.800
TALENTED,
EXTRAORDINARY SURGEON,

26:41.833 --> 26:43.733
EXACTLY LIKE YOUR MOTHER,

26:43.767 --> 26:45.500
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS,

26:45.533 --> 26:47.533
YOU GET TO LEARN
FROM HER MISTAKES.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.700
BE EXTRAORDINARY.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.333
SHE WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT SURGERY.

26:57.367 --> 27:01.200
NO, SHE WASN'T.

27:01.233 --> 27:03.233
SHE WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT SURGERY AT ALL.

27:15.633 --> 27:18.567
WELL, DO I OR DO I NOT
KEEP MY PROMISES?

27:18.600 --> 27:22.400
UH-HUH. YOU DO.

27:22.433 --> 27:27.233
AND REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE?

27:27.267 --> 27:29.633
(sighs) YEAH.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.467
(Lola) HEY.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.800
(sniffles)

27:58.833 --> 28:01.700
HE'S BEEN WAITING
HIS WHOLE LIFE FOR THAT, HUH?

28:01.733 --> 28:03.733
YES, HE HAS.

28:06.367 --> 28:08.500
(elevator bell dings)

28:11.700 --> 28:12.700
ARE THOSE BETH'S FILMS?

28:12.733 --> 28:13.433
YES.

28:13.467 --> 28:15.433
THESE ARE
FROM TWO DAYS AGO,

28:15.467 --> 28:16.833
AND THESE ARE FROM TODAY.

28:16.867 --> 28:19.667
WOULD YOU HAND ME
THE CALIPERS, PLEASE?

28:25.367 --> 28:27.633
THIS ONE IS SMALLER
THAN THAT ONE.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.567
THE TUMOR'S SHRINKING.
THE VIRUS IS WORKING.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.500
OH, MY GOD. (laughs)

28:31.533 --> 28:34.067
YOU HAVE TO GO TELL DEREK.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.333
NO. YOU HAVE TO TELL DEREK.

28:36.367 --> 28:40.067
IT'S THE KIND OF NEWS
HE'D WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

28:41.567 --> 28:43.633
ROSE...

28:43.667 --> 28:47.633
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MAJOR
MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH.

28:47.667 --> 28:50.467
IT'S THE STUFF OF LEGENDS.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.567
(door closes)

28:55.733 --> 28:57.100
HEY!

28:57.133 --> 28:59.767
HEY. OH, YOU GOTTA TAKE
THIS SPARKLE PAGER BACK.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.533
I AM DRUNK ON THE POWER.
WHERE IS IT?

29:02.567 --> 29:05.100
I THINK IT MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE MYSTICAL.
HAVE YOU SEEN DEREK?

29:05.133 --> 29:06.467
NOPE.
(sighs)

29:06.500 --> 29:08.567
(hums)

29:08.600 --> 29:12.367
UM, YOU PAGED, DR. YANG?

29:12.400 --> 29:15.400
GRAB THAT BANANA
FROM MY CUBBY.

29:17.133 --> 29:20.467
YOU--YOU WANT ME TO...
PEEL IT FOR YOU?

29:20.500 --> 29:23.367
NO, I WANT YOU TO LEARN
THE RUNNING WHIP STITCH.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.567
I'M GONNA TEACH IT TO YOU.
TAKE THE NEEDLE.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.500
CHART, PLEASE.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.067
THANK YOU.

29:29.100 --> 29:34.067
(crying)

29:38.467 --> 29:40.367

29:48.233 --> 29:49.800
HI.

29:54.367 --> 29:57.667
HEY. HI.

29:57.700 --> 29:59.800
YOU'RE ALIVE.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.433
YEAH. I'M ALIVE.

30:13.367 --> 30:16.167
HMM.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.233
NOT JUST FOR SHOW ANYMORE.

30:21.067 --> 30:22.633
NO.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.633
(Derek sighs)

30:33.667 --> 30:35.067
(metal clanks)

30:38.567 --> 30:41.700
THAT'S NOT SANITARY.

30:41.733 --> 30:44.700
UH, A LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER.
TRY AGAIN.

30:44.733 --> 30:46.767
DR. YANG, THANK YOU FOR--

30:46.800 --> 30:48.033
UH-HUH.

30:55.267 --> 30:57.800
HOW'D IT GO?

30:57.833 --> 31:00.200
AWFUL. (clears throat)

31:00.233 --> 31:02.600
YEAH.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.700
OKAY, UM...

31:09.733 --> 31:13.200
TH--UH, THESE ARE FOR YOU.

31:13.233 --> 31:16.100
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME
YOUR KEYS TO THE CLINIC?

31:16.133 --> 31:18.067
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
MY KEYS TO THE CLINIC.

31:18.067 --> 31:19.800
I'M GIVING YOU THE CLINIC.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.167
WHAT?

31:21.200 --> 31:23.100
I'VE SEEN
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

31:23.133 --> 31:25.067
I LOVE THE CLINIC.

31:25.067 --> 31:27.233
I LOVE WHAT IT MEANS,
I LOVE WHAT IT IS.

31:27.267 --> 31:29.800
BUT I DON'T LOVE IT
AS MUCH AS I LOVE SURGERY.

31:29.833 --> 31:33.067
I DON'T LOVE IT AS MUCH
AS I LOVE BEING CHIEF RESIDENT.

31:33.067 --> 31:35.467
I DON'T LOVE IT AS MUCH
AS I LOVE...

31:35.500 --> 31:38.167
(voice breaks)
MY HUSBAND AND MY CHILD.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.333
(normal voice) SO...
I HAVE SEEN THE BIGGER PICTURE,

31:41.367 --> 31:45.733
AND I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING
AND STILL HAVE EVERYTHING.

31:45.767 --> 31:48.767
SO I HAVE TO, UH...

31:48.800 --> 31:50.833
LET SOME PIECES GO.

31:50.867 --> 31:54.367

31:54.400 --> 31:56.267
THIS IS YOUR PIECE.

31:56.300 --> 32:00.433
I'VE WATCHED YOU EARN
THIS PIECE

32:00.467 --> 32:03.167
THE HARD WAY, THE AWFUL WAY.

32:03.200 --> 32:05.300

32:05.333 --> 32:08.200
THAT I CAN GIVE THE CLINIC

MEREDITH?

37:54.633 --> 37:56.667

38:00.733 --> 38:03.533
BRAIN MAN... CORNY...
IDIOTIC...

38:03.567 --> 38:07.367
I CANNOT BELIEVE I DID THIS...

38:07.400 --> 38:09.833
STUPID LOSER... SON OF A...

38:09.867 --> 38:12.633
I COULD BE AT HOME
INSTEAD OF... UGH! STUPID...

38:12.667 --> 38:13.833
MEREDITH.

38:13.867 --> 38:15.667
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

38:15.700 --> 38:17.633
I'VE BEEN WAITING
AND WAITING FOR YOU,

38:17.667 --> 38:19.767
AND I DID THIS STUPID,
EMBARRASSING,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.667
HUMILIATING, CORNY THING,

38:21.700 --> 38:23.367
AND I WAS JUST GONNA TELL YOU

38:23.400 --> 38:25.267
THAT THIS OVER HERE
IS OUR KITCHEN

38:25.300 --> 38:27.200
AND THIS IS OUR LIVING ROOM,

38:27.233 --> 38:30.367
AND OVER THERE, THAT'S THE ROOM
WHERE OUR KIDS COULD PLAY.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.067
I HAD THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT
"I WAS GONNA BUILD US A HOUSE,"

38:33.067 --> 38:35.767
BUT I DON'T BUILD HOUSES
BECAUSE I'M A SURGEON.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.733
AND NOW I'M HERE FEELING LIKE
A LAME-ASS LOSER.

38:38.767 --> 38:41.433
I GOT ALL WHOLE AND HEALED,

38:41.467 --> 38:43.367
AND YOU DON'T SHOW UP.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.500
AND NOW IT'S ALL RUINED
BECAUSE YOU TOOK SO LONG

38:45.533 --> 38:47.167
TO COME HOME.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.633
AND I COULDN'T EVEN FIND
THAT BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.

38:50.667 --> 38:54.133

38:54.167 --> 38:56.133
MM-HMM.

THIS IS THE KITCHEN?

38:58.667 --> 39:01.500
LIVING ROOM?

39:01.533 --> 39:03.700
LITTLE SMALL.

39:03.733 --> 39:07.067
I THINK THE VIEW
IS MUCH BETTER FROM HERE.

39:07.100 --> 39:10.667
AND THAT'S THE ROOM WHERE
THE KIDS ARE GONNA PLAY? HMM.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.700

39:13.733 --> 39:16.600

I'M STILL MAD AT YOU, AND I
DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST YOU.

39:19.533 --> 39:22.667
I WANT TO TRUST YOU,
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I DO.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.133
SO I'M JUST GONNA TRY.
I'M GONNA TRY AND TRUST YOU

39:25.167 --> 39:27.200
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BE
EXTRAORDINARY TOGETHER

39:27.233 --> 39:29.067
RATHER THAN ORDINARY APART.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.567
AND I WANNA BE...

39:30.600 --> 39:34.167

39:42.367 --> 39:45.367

39:52.733 --> 39:55.100
(sighs)

39:55.133 --> 39:56.500
I HAVE TO GO.

39:56.533 --> 39:58.300
WHAT?

39:58.333 --> 40:01.200
IN ORDER TO KISS YOU
THE WAY I WANT TO KISS YOU,

40:01.233 --> 40:04.100
IN ORDER TO DO MORE
THAN KISS YOU,

40:04.133 --> 40:06.033
I NEED TO SPEAK TO ROSE.

40:06.067 --> 40:09.100
I WANT MY CONSCIENCE CLEAR

40:09.133 --> 40:11.833
SO THAT I CAN DO MORE
THAN KISS YOU.

40:11.867 --> 40:14.200
***

40:14.233 --> 40:17.167
STAY HERE.

40:17.200 --> 40:19.767
DON'T MOVE.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.500
WAIT FOR ME.

40:22.533 --> 40:26.467
