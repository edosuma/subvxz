WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.545
Okay, great. Bye.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.464
So guess who's coming
to Thanksgiving dinner.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.341
Sidney Poitier? Ha, ha.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.052
I miss Rachel.

00:12.721 --> 00:13.762
No, my parents.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.390
Oh, great, they haven't seen the place
since I moved in.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.977
Yeah, and if you could not mention
that we live together, that'd be great.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.479
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.982
Why can't I tell them
we live together?

00:25.233 --> 00:28.110
They don't know we're dating.
Should we eat in the kitchen?

00:28.820 --> 00:30.195
Why haven't you told them?

00:30.447 --> 00:33.157
Um, well, I was going to. I really was.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.577
But, um, then somewhere,
just out of nowhere, I didn't.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.997
Why haven't you told them?
Wouldn't they be happy?

00:40.248 --> 00:43.542
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
I'll see you then.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.294
Why wouldn't they be happy?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.087
Well, um, because...

00:47.881 --> 00:49.173
...mainly, um...

00:50.508 --> 00:52.301
...they don't like you.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.970
- I'm sorry.
- What? Why? Why?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.639
Maybe because you used to be aloof...

00:57.849 --> 01:00.893
...or that you're really sarcastic
or that you joke around all the time...

01:01.144 --> 01:03.896
...or that you take off your clothes
and throw them on the couch.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.607
Is this why they don't like me
or why you don't like me?

01:07.984 --> 01:11.320
I know I should have told them.
I know I shouldn't care what they think.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.488
I'm sorry.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.785
You know, it'll be okay, because
when they come over, I will be charming.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.621
I will make them love me,
then we'll tell them.

01:20.830 --> 01:21.914
You think that'll work?

01:22.165 --> 01:25.542
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't I?

01:26.795 --> 01:29.421
I don't think you'll ever get
my parents that drunk.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.340
Hey. Oh, good, Ross.
Your parents like me, right?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.509
Yes, of course they like you.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.219
Monica told me they don't.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.096
Yeah, they don't like you.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.390
Do you know why?

02:21.641 --> 02:25.644
Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic,
or maybe it's because you...

02:25.854 --> 02:28.647
If people don't know,
they shouldn't just guess.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.442
Great. Another Thanksgiving
with nothing to give thanks for.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.529
Maybe I give thanks
for you shutting up, huh?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.950
Maybe I give thanks by taking
my PlayStation to my new apartment.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.994
Maybe I love you.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.705
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.373
Hey, guys.

02:46.583 --> 02:50.127
No, I don't want
to play video games, Joey.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.174
Are you guys going
to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?

02:55.383 --> 02:56.425
Yeah, why, what's up?

02:56.634 --> 02:59.136
Well, me and my dancer friends
are doing Thanksgiving uptown.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.138
I thought you might like to come.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.056
For real?

03:04.142 --> 03:06.852
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.520
We'll probably just drink all day.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.564
- We go to yours.
- Yeah.

03:12.025 --> 03:16.111
Yeah, see, we have to stop across the hall
because it's my sister.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.573
But, you know, actually, uh,
growing up with a sister was nice...

03:19.824 --> 03:22.075
...because it really helped me
understand women.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.953
Yeah, you should tell your friends that.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.247
Okay.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.380
How you got three women to marry you,
I'll never know.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.678
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.056
Pheebs, check it out.
For my dessert...

03:44.265 --> 03:46.850
...I have chosen to make
a traditional English trifle.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.812
Wow, that sounds great.
And what are you making, Monica?

03:51.022 --> 03:54.274
In case Rachel's dessert
is so good that I eat all of it...

03:56.319 --> 03:58.737
...and there's none left
for anybody else.

03:59.906 --> 04:00.989
Nothing.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.532
Nothing?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.118
No, sweetie. I trust you.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.705
So if I mess this up,
there's nothing else for dessert?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.166
You're not gonna mess it up.

04:11.501 --> 04:15.212
Wow, Monica, I love that.
You really have faith in me. Thank you.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.382
Technical question: How do you know
when the butter is done?

04:18.632 --> 04:21.885
Well, it's done about two minutes
before it looks like that.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.764
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:25.932 --> 04:30.435
- Oh. The food smells great, Mon.
- And the place looks so nice.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.022
- Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.108
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.027
- Well, this has been great.
- See you.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.365
- Where you going?
- Oh, oh.

04:43.574 --> 04:47.661
We did say we'd stop by this little
thing Joey's roommate is having.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.289
Oh, Janine,
the really hot dancer girl?

04:50.873 --> 04:54.209
Some would say she's attractive, yes.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.503
Who else is going to be there?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.047
- Uh, some of her friends.
- Her dancer friends?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.882
Yes. All right?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.344
All of her hot dancer friends
are gonna be there...

05:04.595 --> 05:07.973
...and they'll be drinking and dancing
and we really want to go.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.394
Dude, we were good.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.523
You're not going. You said
you'd eat here and you'll eat here.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.693
Yeah, and leaving us
to go see hot dancer girls...

05:19.902 --> 05:21.862
...is not very Thanksgiving-y.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.155
Oh, but it is.

05:23.323 --> 05:28.243
Uh, it's like the first Thanksgiving
when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.912
Yeah, and then the Indians
taught the Pilgrims...

05:31.122 --> 05:33.498
...what it meant to be hot
in the New World.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.044
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.173
Hi, Dad. Mom.

05:41.549 --> 05:44.468
Look. Look who it is.
It's Chandler.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.513
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.183
Mr. And Mrs. Geller,
you look wonderful.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.353
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.189
Whoa, it snowing out there?

05:58.232 --> 05:59.274
No.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.658
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.744
You should think about doing this
for a living.

06:13.831 --> 06:18.251
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.005
Dad, Chandler was laughing at your joke.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.840
My joke wasn't funny.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.470
Rach, I just remembered.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.806
I had a dream
about Mr. Geller last night.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.099
Really?

06:32.266 --> 06:34.976
Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me
from a burning building...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.229
...and he was so brave and so strong.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.565
And it's making me look at him
totally differently.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.987
You know, I mean, he used to be just
"Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."

06:46.239 --> 06:49.533
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."

06:52.912 --> 06:55.831
I don't know.
To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...

06:56.040 --> 06:58.291
...walks in while you're changing."

07:01.796 --> 07:05.173
You know, Dad, Chandler is one
of Ross' very best friends.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.175
Ross sure is a great guy.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.761
You know, I've always felt that
how a young man turns out...

07:09.929 --> 07:12.431
...is a reflection on his father.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.309
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.022
He's a headliner of a...

07:21.232 --> 07:23.108
...gay burlesque show.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.447
Rach, you're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?

07:28.656 --> 07:31.241
There's drunken dancers a-waiting.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.577
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.120
Yeah. What is it?

07:35.371 --> 07:37.622
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.042
First there's a layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam...

07:41.294 --> 07:45.172
...then custard,
which I made from scratch...

07:45.381 --> 07:47.215
...then raspberries,
more ladyfingers...

07:47.467 --> 07:49.634
...then beef sautÃ©ed
with peas and onions...

07:50.094 --> 07:52.512
...then a little bit more custard...

07:53.389 --> 07:56.183
...then bananas and then
I put whipped cream on top.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.273
What was the one right before bananas?

08:05.902 --> 08:08.778
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.240
But then I thought,
"Well, there's minced meat pie."

08:12.492 --> 08:14.034
That's an English dessert.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.537
These people just put
very strange things in their food.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.623
By the way,
can I borrow rum from your place?

08:19.874 --> 08:20.999
Yeah, sure.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.376
And while I'm gone,
don't you boys sneak a taste.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.462
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.467
Beef in a dessert?

08:30.968 --> 08:32.969
No, no, no. There is no way.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.306
I know. And only one layer of jam?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.895
What is up with that?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.856
Oh, my God.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.109
- The pages are stuck together.
- Chandler.

08:55.076 --> 08:59.663
Oh, my God. She made
half an English trifle and...

09:00.873 --> 09:03.708
...half a shepherd's pie.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.212
Man, now she's gonna start all over.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.132
We're never gonna get to introduce
the hot girls to the New World.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.678
No, no, we will.
We just won't tell her she messed up.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.888
Just let her serve
the beef-custard thing?

09:17.974 --> 09:21.017
Yeah. It'll be like
a funny Thanksgiving story.

09:21.227 --> 09:24.062
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.316
Joey. God, your apartment
is like a hundred degrees.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.152
Did it make you want
to walk around in your underwear?

09:31.988 --> 09:33.029
No.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.949
Still not hot enough.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.246
Rachel. Okay, look at him.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.790
Look at those strong hands.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.836
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to be that can of condensed milk.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.385
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying
how beautiful your sweater is.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.304
Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it.

09:57.513 --> 10:02.100
Oh. Yes, well, it's very beautiful
and it's cream-colored and tight and...

10:04.562 --> 10:08.273
I don't mean tight. It's not too tight.
Not that I was looking at...

10:09.108 --> 10:11.234
What's the matter with him?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.820
I think he's stoned again.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.281
- What?
- What?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.991
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.

10:24.373 --> 10:27.334
Okay, I think I might know
why my parents don't like you.

10:27.543 --> 10:31.212
- You do? Why?
- Okay, remember we were young. Heh.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.300
Spring break, sophomore year,
I got high in my bedroom...

10:35.551 --> 10:37.719
...and my parents walked in
and smelled it...

10:37.970 --> 10:42.098
...so I told them that you had gotten stoned
and jumped out the window.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.934
What? Why did you do that?

10:45.144 --> 10:48.980
I don't know. Uh, yours was the first
name that popped into my head.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.232
I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd matter.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.484
How could it not matter?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.236
How was I to know
we'd be friends after college...

10:55.488 --> 10:57.489
...let alone
you'd be living with my sister?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.532
What about all that
"friends forever" stuff?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.452
I don't know. I was all high.

11:09.335 --> 11:13.505
Mom and Dad just sent me to find out
if you were trying to get Ross stoned.

11:15.633 --> 11:19.761
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot
in college, and he blamed it on me.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.388
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that.

11:21.639 --> 11:26.142
We haven't told them we're together
because they hate me, okay? So fix this.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.355
Okay, okay, I'll tell them
it wasn't Chandler who got high.

11:30.564 --> 11:33.066
Now, who should I say it was?

11:33.734 --> 11:38.530
You. It's not like it's a big deal.
You don't still do it or anything.

11:38.739 --> 11:43.076
All right. Now, who should I say
tricked me into doing it?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.374
Dad.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.210
Dad, please don't pick
your teeth out here.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.089
- And if you're gonna put your feet up...
- Monica, leave him alone.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.759
Will you hurry up?

12:00.010 --> 12:03.763
Did you not hear me when I told you
that all of Janine's friends are dancers?

12:03.931 --> 12:07.058
Huh? And that they're gonna
be drinking a lot?

12:07.643 --> 12:11.688
No, I did. But tell me again
because it's so romantic.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.482
You're whipping so slow.
Can't you do it any faster?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.860
Joey, come on,
I don't want to make any mistakes.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.988
This is the only dessert. If I screw it up,
everybody's gonna be like:

12:20.239 --> 12:24.367
"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving
when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"

12:26.412 --> 12:30.206
So just let me worry about making it,
and you just worry about eating it.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.875
Oh, I am.

12:33.544 --> 12:37.505
- Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will.
- Okay. Fine.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.134
- Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, uh...

12:41.302 --> 12:43.887
Can it wait a second, Joey?
I have to tell my parents something.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.638
No, it can't? Okay.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.897
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel
she messed up her dessert.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.316
What? What is with everybody?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.193
It's Thanksgiving, not...

12:58.444 --> 13:00.445
...Truth Day.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.783
Look, when everyone eats
that banana-meat thing...

13:04.992 --> 13:07.577
...they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.206
Okay. We'll just get everyone
to act like they like it.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.416
That way, no one makes fun of her...

13:13.626 --> 13:16.920
...and we still get to go
to sweet potato pie.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.964
Dude, they're not objects.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.883
Oh.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.636
Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
You distract her.

13:26.096 --> 13:29.641
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.769
Okay.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.902
What's up, Ross?

13:41.612 --> 13:42.821
So, um...

13:43.906 --> 13:45.698
Thanksgiving.

13:47.451 --> 13:51.037
The holiday season is upon us, hmm?

13:52.581 --> 13:53.581
Yeah.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.708
And, um...

13:57.044 --> 13:59.087
...you look nice today.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.674
- Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
- What?

14:02.925 --> 14:07.220
I just don't think us getting back together
is a good idea.

14:08.722 --> 14:09.764
Huh?

14:10.766 --> 14:12.684
I thought this might happen today.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.103
Ross, I know the holidays can be rough...

14:15.354 --> 14:18.481
...and it's probably really hard
for you to be alone right now.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.816
You're alone.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.027
No, I live with Phoebe.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.197
I mean, you're alone-alone.

14:27.116 --> 14:31.160
And it's just not the time for us.
I'm sorry.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.706
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.921
And, uh, if anyone needs help
pretending to like it...

14:42.172 --> 14:46.175
...I learned some things in acting class.
Try, uh, rubbing your stomach.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.346
Or, uh, saying "Mm."

14:50.556 --> 14:52.849
And, uh, oh, smiling.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.225
Okay?

14:54.685 --> 14:57.854
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay
for those acting classes anymore.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.067
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.447
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You know what? You don't get any dessert.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.740
Really?

15:10.159 --> 15:13.286
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.331
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.209
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional
English trifle, isn't it?

15:20.419 --> 15:21.711
- It sure is.
- Wow.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.047
So did you make it
with beef or eggplant?

15:24.381 --> 15:27.926
- Beef.
- I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Oh.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.969
Aw.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.641
Monica, I want you
to have the first taste.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.476
Really?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.648
Wait, you only got whipped cream.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.067
You gotta take a bite
with all the layers.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.904
Okay.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.697
You dropped a pea.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.625
Well?

16:01.669 --> 16:03.294
Mm.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.761
It's good.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.888
Really? How good?

16:14.098 --> 16:16.099
It's so good that I feel really selfish...

16:16.308 --> 16:18.559
...about being the only one
who's eating it.

16:18.769 --> 16:22.313
I think we should have everyone
taste how good it is.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.607
Especially Ross.

16:27.945 --> 16:28.987
Mm-hm.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.197
Mm.

16:31.448 --> 16:35.076
Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna
go enjoy it on the balcony.

16:37.162 --> 16:41.207
So that I can enjoy the view
whilst I enjoy my dessert.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.460
I've gotta call my friend...

16:44.670 --> 16:47.338
...and tell her how good
this is from Monica's room.

16:47.589 --> 16:48.840
I'll help you dial.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.428
I'm gonna go into the bathroom...

16:53.679 --> 16:56.639
...so I can look at it
in the mirror as I eat it.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.561
Okay, what was that all about?
Does it not taste good?

17:01.770 --> 17:04.021
- Let me try it.
- No, no.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.694
All gone.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.449
So good.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.785
Maybe Chandler has some left.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.582
It tastes like feet.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.335
I like it.

17:29.923 --> 17:30.965
Are you kidding?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.760
What's not to like? Custard, good.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.180
Jam, good. Meat, good.

17:39.558 --> 17:43.019
So a bird just grabbed it...

17:45.314 --> 17:48.441
...and then tried
to fly away with it...

17:48.942 --> 17:51.277
...and then just dropped it
on the street?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.990
Yes, but, if it's any consolation,
before the bird dropped it...

17:56.200 --> 17:58.284
...he seemed to enjoy it.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.037
Rachel, come here.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.914
Okay.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.667
I was just taking my Thanksgiving nap
and I had another dream about Jack.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.921
- Phoebe, do I want to hear this?
- I don't know, let's see.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.299
Okay, I dreamt we were getting married...

18:13.509 --> 18:15.551
...and he left because
he had to go fight a fire.

18:15.719 --> 18:20.139
And, um, so, okay, I went to a nightclub
and I saw him making out with a girl.

18:20.390 --> 18:23.226
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.561
Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came...

18:25.771 --> 18:28.106
...and he kicked his ass
for betraying me.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.982
It was so cool.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.528
Then he took me diving
and introduced me to his pet sea horse...

18:33.779 --> 18:38.157
...who was coming on to me.
And, please, that is not gonna happen.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.080
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.544
Five minutes ago, a line like that
would have floored me.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.756
But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.095
Ross? Let's go.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.848
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad...

19:02.057 --> 19:04.892
...I was thinking about
maybe writing a letter.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.311
You know what?
That's it. You've had your chance.

19:09.022 --> 19:12.775
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.610
- What?
- What?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.280
You are such a tattletale.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.493
Mom, Dad, heh...

19:22.661 --> 19:25.621
...you remember that time
you walked in my room...

19:25.873 --> 19:27.707
...and smelled marijuana?

19:27.875 --> 19:29.458
- Yes.
- Yes.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.214
I told you it was Chandler...

19:35.465 --> 19:38.801
...who was smoking the pot but...

19:40.637 --> 19:43.139
...it was me. I'm sorry.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.682
It was you?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.560
And, Dad, you know that mailman
that you got fired?

19:47.811 --> 19:51.480
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.

19:56.361 --> 20:00.239
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break
the porch swing. Monica did.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.536
Ross hasn't worked
at the museum for a year.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.874
Monica and Chandler
are living together!

20:12.836 --> 20:16.881
Ross married Rachel in Vegas.
And got divorced. Again!

20:18.759 --> 20:20.718
I love Jacques Cousteau.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.558
I wasn't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.478
I want to go!

20:33.232 --> 20:37.610
That's a lot of information
to get in 30 seconds.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.031
All right. Joey, if you want
to leave, just leave.

20:43.784 --> 20:48.037
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.248
It did not taste good.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.919
Phoebe, I'm sorry...

20:55.128 --> 20:58.422
...but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.843
Monica, why you felt
you had to hide the fact...

21:03.053 --> 21:05.930
...that you're in an important
relationship is beyond me.

21:06.181 --> 21:09.058
And we kind of figured
about the porch swing.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.144
Ross.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.479
Drugs?

21:13.730 --> 21:15.690
Divorced again?

21:17.359 --> 21:18.693
What happened, son?

21:18.944 --> 21:23.864
I... I, uh...
I got tricked into all those things.

21:25.325 --> 21:30.121
Chandler, you've been
Ross' best friend all these years...

21:30.330 --> 21:33.165
...stuck by him
during the drug problems...

21:35.460 --> 21:38.296
...and now you've taken on
Monica as well.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.757
Well, I don't know what to say.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.884
You're a wonderful human being.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.472
- Thank you.
- No.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.516
Thank you.

21:52.102 --> 21:56.814
Monica and Ross, I don't know
what I'm gonna do about the two of you.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.734
I'll talk to them.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.325
You guys, it was bananas...

22:07.576 --> 22:09.910
...cream and beef.

22:10.746 --> 22:14.623
I just cannot believe that you ate that
so that I wouldn't feel bad.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.085
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.295
No it isn't, I ate that.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.133
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.635
Nope, got it and got yours too.
