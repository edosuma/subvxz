KAREN:
So we have aisle seats, we have

00:35.936 --> 00:38.070
a couple of drinks, and
we get to the airport.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.272
Neither of us speaks a word of
Italian, by the way. (CHUCKLING)

00:40.273 --> 00:42.007
So this guy thinks he'll be able to

00:42.008 --> 00:45.177
- find his luggage if he speaks Pig Latin.
- Ah.

00:45.178 --> 00:47.212
Yeah, that's right.
I said "Looking for bags."

00:47.213 --> 00:50.983
But it came out "Ook-in-lay
or-fay ags-bay."

00:50.984 --> 00:52.184
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:52.185 --> 00:54.386
That is too funny.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.156
- I said "That's it. I'm never
leaving the country again." - Ugh!

00:57.157 --> 00:59.158
Joel can't even leave the
Upper West Side of Manhattan.

00:59.159 --> 01:01.026
That's true. For me,
the perfect vacation

01:01.027 --> 01:04.462
is getting a cheese danish from Zabar's
and curling up with the <i>Sunday Times.</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:05.698
(CHUCKLING)

01:05.699 --> 01:07.499
So do you still read <i>The Times?</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:09.101
Oh, boy. Kyle thinks <i>The
Times</i> has gone downhill.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.436
Now, I beg to differ.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.271
It's nothing but a
worthless yellow rag.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.306
We've been having this fight
since the day we met.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.108
- (CHUCKLES) Well, it probably
seems that way. - Hmm.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.277
No, we literally met when
we were both on a panel

01:18.278 --> 01:20.612
at the Guggenheim debating the
merits of the <i>New York Times.</i>

01:20.613 --> 01:22.514
And I said, "Who is
this know-it-all girl?"

01:22.515 --> 01:24.516
And I thought, "Who
is this pompous guy?"

01:24.517 --> 01:25.752
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

01:25.753 --> 01:29.288
Anyway, our heated discussion
continued over a bottle of merlot.

01:29.289 --> 01:33.692
Let's just say the discussing part
stopped, but the heated part continued.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.495
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
- Okay.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.731
For better or worse, we've
been together ever since.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.332
Probably worse, right?

01:40.333 --> 01:43.567
Oh, definitely for
worse. It's awful.

01:45.037 --> 01:47.573
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:47.574 --> 01:50.576
So, Joel, Molly,
how'd you two meet?

01:50.577 --> 01:52.511
- Oh, boy. That's a long story.
- Yeah.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.114
Oh, we've got time.
Waiter! More wine.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.017
Well, it's kind of a corny,
romantic comedy kind of story.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.020
- That's true. That is true.
- Really? How so?

02:01.021 --> 02:03.589
Well, Joel is kind of a typical
romantic comedy leading man.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.691
He's handsome, but in a
non-threatening way.

02:05.692 --> 02:09.127
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Vaguely but not overtly Jewish.

02:09.128 --> 02:13.298
- You're right. He's just Jewish enough.
- And Molly is the kind of cute, klutzy

02:13.299 --> 02:15.401
girl that sometimes will
drive you a little crazy,

02:15.402 --> 02:16.802
- but you can't help but fall in love with her.
- (CHUCKLES)

02:16.803 --> 02:18.570
Guilty.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.739
- Okay. So we have our main characters.
- Not quite.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.209
There is another character that was
just as important as the two of us.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.145
- Mmm.
- New York City.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.113
Ah! Mmm.

02:28.114 --> 02:30.714
So New York City is
like another character?

02:30.715 --> 02:31.583
Yeah.

02:31.584 --> 02:35.254
So if there was a movie
about your relationship,

02:35.255 --> 02:38.323
it would probably start with aerial
shots of the Manhattan skyline.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.059
Exactly.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.126
(HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING)

02:50.502 --> 02:53.138
JOEL: <i>I was living in a loft
on Broadway and 86th Street,</i>

02:53.139 --> 02:57.109
<i>and I had a girlfriend at the time,
Tiffany. She worked in the fashion industry.</i>

02:57.110 --> 02:59.378
<i>Very put together. Never
had a hair out of place.</i>

02:59.379 --> 03:01.747
<i>But there was something
cold about her.</i>

03:01.748 --> 03:03.082
Hey, you.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.416
Hey.

03:04.417 --> 03:05.751
I love you.

03:05.752 --> 03:09.486
Mmm, and I admire your spirit.

03:11.423 --> 03:13.792
Thanks.

03:13.793 --> 03:16.195
MOLLY: <i>And I was just
getting over a break-up,</i>

03:16.196 --> 03:18.797
<i>so the closest thing I had to a
boyfriend was my dog, Charlie.</i>

03:18.798 --> 03:21.300
- Hey, handsome!
- (GROUP LAUGHING)

03:21.301 --> 03:23.335
MOLLY: <i>I wasn't all put
together like Tiffany.</i>

03:23.336 --> 03:26.604
<i>In fact, as Joel said
earlier, I was a real klutz.</i>

03:27.341 --> 03:29.341
JOEL: <i>Klutz is the
understatement of the century.</i>

03:29.342 --> 03:31.210
(GROUP LAUGHING)

03:31.211 --> 03:32.977

Oh!

04:07.746 --> 04:09.613
Ugh!

04:12.618 --> 04:15.487
JOEL: <i>See, New York is such an
important part of our lives,</i>

04:15.488 --> 04:17.355
<i>it's almost like another
character in our story.</i>

04:17.356 --> 04:18.591
KYLE: <i>Right. You said that.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:21.326
MOLLY: <i>I really didn't feel like
I needed a love life, you know?</i>

04:21.327 --> 04:23.729
<i>In fact, New York City was
almost like a boyfriend to me.</i>

04:23.730 --> 04:25.397
KAREN: <i>Oh, right.</i>

04:25.398 --> 04:27.332
- KYLE: <i>That is so good.</i>
- KAREN: <i>Very good.</i>

04:27.333 --> 04:29.700
KYLE:
<i>That's very good. That's very cool.</i>

04:38.510 --> 04:42.648
MOLLY: <i>Most importantly, I had my
little candy shop, Upper Sweet Side.</i>

04:42.649 --> 04:44.750
<i>I was living my dream, of
owning a shop that was</i>

04:44.751 --> 04:48.420
charming and adorable, and
impossible not to like.

04:48.421 --> 04:52.491
You guys have not lived until you've
tried my Creamy Caramel Clusters.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.793
- They're better than sex!
- (JOEL AND KYLE CHUCKLING)

04:54.794 --> 04:56.728
When you've been married
as long as we have,

04:56.729 --> 04:59.565
taking a stinky shit is better than
having sex. (BOTH CHUCKLING)

04:59.566 --> 05:01.733
Only in New York, right?

05:01.734 --> 05:04.269
MOLLY: <i>Anyway, I was in no
rush to meet someone new.</i>

05:04.270 --> 05:07.839
<i>I was mainly concerned about
trying to keep my business afloat.</i>

05:07.840 --> 05:10.742
<i>So many mom and pop
shops being elbowed out</i>

05:10.743 --> 05:14.044
<i>by faceless evil
conglomerates like CSR.</i>

05:14.880 --> 05:17.716
- KAREN: <i>Wait a minute.</i>
- JOEL: <i>That's right.</i>

05:17.717 --> 05:20.319
<i>I was an executive at Candy
Systems and Research.</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:24.489
<i>I was the bad guy! I didn't think
of myself as a corporate raider.</i>

05:24.490 --> 05:26.992
<i>I thought of myself as a
nice guy with a great job.</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:30.662
So he went down on me, and I
came in one second. (CHUCKLES)

05:30.663 --> 05:32.397
Morning, Melanie.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.399

call you later. Bye, Dad.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.575
- Bob, my best friend!
- Joel, my best buddy!

05:43.576 --> 05:48.247
Guess what? After years of dating
Tiffany, I'm finally popping the question.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.782
Wow. So I guess you're finally dealing
with those commitment issues you have.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.651
Yeah, I even bought her
a ring and everything.

05:52.652 --> 05:56.455
Amazing. Because until now the only
thing you've been willing to commit to

05:56.456 --> 05:59.323
- are your commitment issues.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

06:02.027 --> 06:03.495
It's true.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.564

BOB: Joel?

06:26.786 --> 06:28.053
What do you want, Trevor?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.054
Congrats on snaggin' the
Dickricker account.

06:31.056 --> 06:32.624
Yeah, right. Sure.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.860
You ready for the big
meeting with Roland?

06:34.861 --> 06:37.963
I'd hate for you guys to screw everything
up again, like you did last time.

06:37.964 --> 06:43.367
So now I'm in line for the big promotion.
Not you. Pretty funny, huh?

- BOB: Joel? A little help here, buddy.
- TREVOR: Oh, Joel...

06:47.373 --> 06:49.741
Is your girlfriend
Tiffany home right now?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.775
Yeah, she should be. Why?

06:54.546 --> 06:56.180
No reason.

06:57.082 --> 06:58.583
What the...

06:58.584 --> 07:01.420
Sounds like this Trevor guy's trying
to get it on with your girlfriend.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.589
Well, in retrospect, I agree with you, but
at the time it seemed like he was just

07:04.590 --> 07:08.392
grabbing a condom out of the rubber bowl
and headin' over to meet my girlfriend.

07:10.028 --> 07:12.129
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

and Research Superstore.

07:25.812 --> 07:29.047
First order of business, to
suss out the competition.

07:29.048 --> 07:32.983
Are there any other nearby
candy stores we need to

07:34.353 --> 07:36.888
"know about"?

07:36.889 --> 07:39.991
The only one we could find
is just this really small

07:39.992 --> 07:42.728
quirky candy shop across the
street from our location.

07:42.729 --> 07:47.933
- It's called Upper Sweet Side, NYC.
- Kind of a dumb name for a store, huh?

07:47.934 --> 07:50.134
(ALL LAUGHING)

07:55.674 --> 07:58.443
That's so stupid.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.945
- No, I think it's kind of clever. I like it.
- What was that, Joel?

08:02.714 --> 08:04.583
Nothing, sir.

08:04.584 --> 08:10.220
That'll be $100,000 dollars.
I'm just kidding. It's all free.

08:12.557 --> 08:15.527
Oh, I love my little shop, Wanda.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.697
It's what I've always dreamed of,
ever since I was a little girl.

08:18.698 --> 08:22.667
And it's never going anywhere.
Nothing is ever going to threaten it.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.603
- Oh, no.
- What?

08:24.604 --> 08:26.838

put us out of business!

08:32.511 --> 08:36.615
Discovering this information
is a huge turn of events.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.751
You weren't kidding. Your story
really is like a corny movie.

08:39.751 --> 08:43.352
I know. The only difference is it's
not a movie. It's our real life.

- Hi, Mr. Flaps.

- Oh, Please. My friends call me Eggbert.
- Then they must not be very good friends.

08:55.067 --> 08:58.170
No, that's just my name.
Eggbert. Or Eggman, for short.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.907
I know. It's kind of a lame
name, but what can you do?

- How about we take a
gander at those documentos?

you heard that Frank and
I finally broke up.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.062
I did hear. Yeah.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.064

divorce. I'm sorry.

- I...
- It's just one of those things.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.904
We wanted different things.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.007
I wanted a family, settle
down, start a life together.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.742
- And what did she want?
- Who can say?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.478
I guess you'd have
to ask my brother.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.144
Oh.

09:45.617 --> 09:48.520
- Is he here? Can I ask him?
- Yes. Keith.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.622
- You have a second?
- What's up?

09:50.623 --> 09:52.724
Hey, Keith. I was just wondering,

09:52.725 --> 09:55.260
what did Hillary want that was
different than what Eggbert wanted?

09:55.261 --> 09:57.496
Uh, she just wanted to
travel more, she wanted

09:57.497 --> 09:59.231
to focus on her
photo-journalism career.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.032
And marriage just wasn't
conducive to that.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.602
- Thanks, Keith.
- Thanks, Keith.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.105

over these numbers,

- You have breast cancer.
- What?

Corporately speaking.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.915
Oh. Oh.

Your business has, at
best, six months to live.

- See for yourself.

10:24.789 --> 10:26.758
Wow. You are serious.

10:26.759 --> 10:30.562
Listen, Molly, would this
be an awkward time to

10:30.563 --> 10:34.798
ask if maybe you'd like to
go out with me sometime?

10:34.799 --> 10:37.002
Um...

10:37.003 --> 10:39.237
Don't answer. Just think about it.

10:39.238 --> 10:43.240
That's very sweet of you, Eggfart, but I
think I'm just gonna focus on me for now.

10:44.776 --> 10:48.111
Totally. You've gotta take
time for yourself, you know.

10:50.949 --> 10:54.853

- No, please. I think I'm gonna go...

10:54.854 --> 10:56.575

32:31.582 --> 32:33.250
'Kay.

32:33.251 --> 32:36.053
I like how you say "'kay."

32:36.054 --> 32:38.787
I like how you say, "I
like how you say "'kay.'"

32:48.332 --> 32:50.067
(CHUCKLING)

32:50.068 --> 32:52.502
Molly, where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.171
Who are you?

32:54.172 --> 32:56.373
Joel, this is my older
sister, Katherine.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.342
- Katherine, this is Joel.
- Hi.

32:58.343 --> 33:01.078
Don't "hi" me, Joel. You're
just like all the others.

33:01.079 --> 33:03.380
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.015
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi!

33:05.016 --> 33:06.483
You have a kid?

33:06.484 --> 33:08.452
Don't worry, Joel. His
dad's out of the picture.

33:08.453 --> 33:11.655
He's doing T-I-M-E in jail.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.091
Tucker, this is my friend, Joel.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.493
Hi, Mr. Joel. Are you my new daddy?

33:16.494 --> 33:18.395
Oh! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

33:18.396 --> 33:21.231
Hey, buddy, I see you've got
on some Pokemon pajamas.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.166
Yeah.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.502
My favorite one is Smeargle.
You know why?

33:25.503 --> 33:28.038
Because he can defend
Butterfree's Hyper Reverse Attack

33:28.039 --> 33:29.573
with two double
colorless energy cards

33:29.574 --> 33:31.375
and only get 10 damage points.

33:31.376 --> 33:34.144
You know about Pokemon?
You're cool, Mr. Joel!

33:34.145 --> 33:35.512
I think you're cool, Tucker.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.681
What is... Wait a minute.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.316
What is that in your ear? What?

33:41.018 --> 33:42.386
That's for you.

33:42.387 --> 33:44.354
Wow! A cheeseburger, Mommy!

33:44.355 --> 33:47.024
Wow! Go eat that in bed.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.391
Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight, Daddy.

33:51.228 --> 33:52.963
I mean "Joel".

33:52.964 --> 33:54.430
Oh!

33:56.633 --> 33:58.867
Oh.

34:01.238 --> 34:03.073
I think he likes you.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.040
I think I like him.

34:06.443 --> 34:08.944
Dinner was delicious, Molly.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.081
Here. A little chilly...

34:13.984 --> 34:15.385
Joel, can I tell you something?

34:15.386 --> 34:17.955
Sure. What is it?

34:17.956 --> 34:21.091
If I was ever about to marry
someone, and then realized

34:21.092 --> 34:24.094
that I didn't want to do it,
you know where I would go?

34:24.094 --> 34:28.165
Ah, random guess, but Boston?

34:28.166 --> 34:31.635
No. The Brooklyn Promenade.
Where I can look out over the city.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.036
It's very comforting.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.505
What you're saying to me is that
if you were to ever get married

34:35.505 --> 34:38.275
and then decide at the last minute that
you didn't want to marry that person

34:38.275 --> 34:41.078
- you would go to the Brooklyn Promenade.
- Yes. You see where I'm going with this?

34:41.079 --> 34:43.347
I think so. Yeah.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.482
I believe in fate, Joel.

34:45.483 --> 34:48.484
And If we were meant to be
together, then we will be.

34:49.152 --> 34:52.155
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:52.156 --> 34:53.422
I can't do this.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.424
Why? What did I do?

34:54.425 --> 34:56.426
I'm sorry.

34:56.427 --> 35:00.564
It's just that Tiffany, my ex, used
to say that exact same thing to me.

35:00.565 --> 35:04.601
- She used to say "hey"?
- Yeah.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.670
And I'm not so sure I'm ready
for this kind of thing...

35:06.671 --> 35:09.373
No, I understand. I didn't
want to kiss you anyway.

35:09.374 --> 35:12.409
I like you. It's just the way
you said "hey" like that...

35:12.410 --> 35:13.677
Goodnight, Joel.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.413
JOEL: Hey, no, look, Molly...
Molly, wait... Look.

35:16.414 --> 35:18.749
I think you're great.
I just need a little time.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.385
You think you're the only
person that's ever been hurt?

35:21.386 --> 35:24.254
Do you think it was easy for me
to watch Frank go Downward Dog

35:24.255 --> 35:27.224
on the yoga instructor while
they were lying on my mat?

35:27.225 --> 35:29.159
- My mat, Joel.
- I didn't know.

35:29.160 --> 35:33.061
You don't know anything! I can't even
do yoga any more. I only do Pilates.

35:33.597 --> 35:34.798
Good night.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.465
Molly...

35:37.200 --> 35:38.867
Molly, wait!

35:41.471 --> 35:43.138
Shit!

35:49.546 --> 35:53.784
JOEL: <i>I knew at that very moment
that I had screwed up big-time.</i>

35:53.785 --> 35:57.120
And then walking home,
I had this realization

35:57.121 --> 36:00.357
that my inability to open my dream
coffee shop was in many ways

36:00.358 --> 36:02.726
a metaphor for my inability to
follow through in my romantic life.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.795
Ah.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.097
And once I figured that out, I
didn't want to waste another moment

36:07.098 --> 36:09.666
before rushing back to Molly
and asking for another chance.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.101
So that's what you did?

36:11.102 --> 36:14.204
Not right away. This buddy of mine
who was super into boogie-boarding

36:14.205 --> 36:15.572
invited me down to his place
in Miami to check it out,

36:15.573 --> 36:17.607
so I went down there
for the weekend.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.609
But as soon as I got back, I
headed straight to Molly's store.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.812
<i>I didn't want to screw it up again,</i>

36:21.813 --> 36:24.114
<i>so I practiced what I was going
to say until it was perfect.</i>

36:24.115 --> 36:26.149
Hey Molly, I had such a
great time the other night.

36:26.150 --> 36:29.219
I'm sorry I got weird there
at the end. I was just so...

36:29.220 --> 36:31.854
I was just so hamburgies
and hotdoggies.

36:33.490 --> 36:36.293
No, that sounds stupid.
That sounds so stupid.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.162
Hey Molly, I had a great
time the other night.

36:39.163 --> 36:41.431
Sorry it got weird
at the end there.

36:41.432 --> 36:44.234
I've been going through a lot recently,
and I was just feeling all...

36:44.235 --> 36:46.001
Green beans!

36:46.770 --> 36:50.640
No! Hey, Molly. Pancakey.

36:50.641 --> 36:54.111
Molly! I think your
friend Joel is here.

36:54.112 --> 36:57.114
And it looks like he's
rehearsing an apology speech.

36:57.115 --> 37:00.317
Oh, no, Wanda! I look terrible!
I look like a chimney sweep.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.852
Okay, quick! I'll help you
find something better.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.585
Come on, let's hurry, then!

37:13.530 --> 37:15.097
Molly?

37:17.601 --> 37:19.568
Guess she's not here.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.180
Is that you? Hey, Joel, I...

37:33.416 --> 37:35.217
Where'd he go?

37:35.919 --> 37:37.653
Was that you?

37:41.324 --> 37:43.593
Oh, hey, big brother. Did
you go apologize to Molly?

37:43.594 --> 37:46.530
Oh, hey. I went by her
store, but she wasn't there.

37:46.531 --> 37:49.164
- Well, did you leave her a note?
- No. Should I have?

37:50.934 --> 37:55.172
You know, for a smart guy, big
brother, you sure are an idiot.

37:55.173 --> 37:58.575
You know what, Jake? I've had it up
to here with your little comments.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.877
You've got a bone to pick
with me, then spit it out.

38:00.878 --> 38:03.346
What? Is this about rent, Joel?

38:03.347 --> 38:05.882
Because you can have
your stupid money.

38:05.883 --> 38:10.453
No. It's not about money, Jake.
It's never been about money!

38:10.454 --> 38:13.723
But you know what? If you have a little
rent, then, sure, I'd gladly take it!

38:13.724 --> 38:16.726
- I was being rhetorical!
- Of course you were!

38:16.727 --> 38:18.327
Of course you were!

38:19.596 --> 38:21.298
You're like a child.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.733
Well, if being a grown-up means

38:23.734 --> 38:27.470
being a corporate drone
like you, then no thanks!

38:27.471 --> 38:29.339
I've got dreams, man!

38:29.340 --> 38:31.675
Well, your dreams don't
pay for the rent!

38:31.676 --> 38:35.812
- This corporate drone does!
- Do you remember the tire swing?

38:35.813 --> 38:37.981
I don't have time for this.
No, I don't have time...

38:37.982 --> 38:40.349
I know you remember it, Joel!

38:41.384 --> 38:44.254
The old maple tree.

38:44.255 --> 38:48.525
We used to spend hours in that
thing. Where'd it go, Joel?

38:48.526 --> 38:50.560
You sold it, didn't you?

38:50.561 --> 38:54.396
You traded in our fun for,
what, a few greenbacks?

38:58.001 --> 39:02.539
When Mom and Dad died,
I had to sell that tire

39:02.540 --> 39:05.841
to put food in your belly
and a shirt on your back.

39:07.510 --> 39:12.747
It was for you, Jake. All of it.

39:13.850 --> 39:15.851
(VOICE BREAKING)
It was always for you.

39:17.721 --> 39:19.955
I really miss Mom and Dad.

39:20.523 --> 39:22.090
Me, too.

39:22.692 --> 39:24.259
Me, too.
(SOBBING)

39:30.367 --> 39:32.035
Call Molly.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.837
Call her, man.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.771
Tell her how you feel.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.074
I'm gonna go run some errands.

39:40.944 --> 39:42.411
Hey, Jake.

39:43.446 --> 39:44.980
Yeah?

39:46.549 --> 39:48.717
Thanks, little brother.

39:53.056 --> 39:55.025
Hey, Joel?

39:55.026 --> 39:56.559
Yeah?

39:56.560 --> 39:58.193
Go get 'em, Tiger.

39:58.728 --> 40:00.262
(SIGHS)

40:01.865 --> 40:03.066
Hey, Jake?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.800
Yeah?

40:05.769 --> 40:07.269
Thanks.

40:08.838 --> 40:10.407
Joel, one last thing.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.973
What's up?

40:12.609 --> 40:14.477
Thanks.

40:14.478 --> 40:15.712
Jake!

40:15.713 --> 40:17.245
Yo.

40:17.881 --> 40:19.347
Thanks.

40:22.385 --> 40:24.821
Okay, I'm lost. What's going on?

40:24.822 --> 40:27.390
Basically he sold the tire
swing to feed his brother.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.659
I get that, but what does it
have to do with the two of you?

40:29.660 --> 40:31.561
Um, I think the idea is that

40:31.562 --> 40:33.396
- after they meet up...
- Right.

40:33.397 --> 40:35.365
they both realize, you
know, how short life is.

40:35.366 --> 40:39.336
And so the brother told him to
call her to say he was sorry.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.471
And then he went and ran errands.

40:41.472 --> 40:42.739
Is it something like that?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.107
Yeah. Sure. Whatever you want.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.542
So I called her right away.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.544
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?

40:47.545 --> 40:49.079
Hey, Molly, it's Joel.
How's it going?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.680
Hi.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.649
Uh, look, I wanted to
call you and apologize

40:52.650 --> 40:55.819
for the way that I behaved the other
night. I've learned that my inability to

40:55.820 --> 40:57.987
follow through on my
dream coffee shop

40:57.988 --> 41:03.059
is a metaphor for my inability to
follow through on my romantic life.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.362
Listen, I wanna clear something
up before we go any further.

41:05.363 --> 41:06.930
I really appreciate your
apology about the other night,

41:06.931 --> 41:10.367
but why did you come over to my store
<i>and then leave without coming in?</i>

41:10.368 --> 41:12.702
- <i>I did come in, but I couldn't find you.</i>
- <i>Oh, Really?</i>

41:12.703 --> 41:14.398
<i>I came there to apologize to you,</i>

41:14.399 --> 41:15.805
<i>- because I was a jerk.
- Oh.</i>

41:15.806 --> 41:17.506
Okay, good. Well, good.

41:19.476 --> 41:22.010
Molly, are you free
for dinner tonight?

41:23.146 --> 41:25.682
<i>Sure.</i>

41:25.683 --> 41:27.884
MOLLY: Wanda, I really
like this guy, Joel,

41:27.885 --> 41:29.819
but I just don't know
if he's the one.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.757
I mean, I wish there was some
sort of sign that proved it.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.925
Well, how about this?

41:35.926 --> 41:37.761
When you meet up with him
tonight, change the way you look.

41:37.762 --> 41:42.490
Just a tiny little bit. But if he notices,
then that's how you'll know he's the one.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.601
Oh.

41:44.602 --> 41:48.138
Change the way I look
and see if he notices.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.673
Wanda, thank you. You're the best.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.140
You are.

41:54.978 --> 41:56.513
No.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.475
I just felt like I
was gettin' a vibe.

42:09.025 --> 42:10.926
- Hey.
- Hi, there.

42:11.661 --> 42:12.829
You look different.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.164
Really? You think so?

42:14.165 --> 42:16.364
You've got Groucho glasses on.

42:18.735 --> 42:21.438
You noticed.

42:21.439 --> 42:24.399
Of course. You must have gone to
a gag store or something, huh?

42:25.742 --> 42:27.309
You're something.

42:27.977 --> 42:29.444
Come on, let's eat.

42:31.448 --> 42:33.116
(SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

42:33.117 --> 42:35.485
<i>Bonjour.</i> May I take your coat?

42:35.486 --> 42:36.853
No, thank you. I'll keep mine.

42:36.854 --> 42:38.521
We're okay.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.590
Well, in that case,

42:40.591 --> 42:45.061
may I then suggest you try the
greasy diner on Columbus and 67th.

42:45.062 --> 42:49.833
I think you will find their cuisine
and service up to your standards.

42:49.834 --> 42:52.502
Boy, does that guy have a
pole up his ass or what?

42:52.503 --> 42:54.037
Yeah.

42:54.038 --> 42:56.398
- Watch out, Joel! He does!
- (DISHES SHATTERING)

43:02.078 --> 43:04.247
Care to hear our specials?

43:04.248 --> 43:05.982
That's not necessary.

43:05.983 --> 43:08.224
I'm feeling adventurous tonight.
Surprise me.

43:08.685 --> 43:10.887
What? Really?

43:10.888 --> 43:12.522
You're willing to just throw
caution to the wind like that?

43:12.523 --> 43:14.224
Sure.

43:14.225 --> 43:17.126
Very well, <i>madame. For
the fish, we have...</i>

43:17.127 --> 43:19.895
Uh, wait! Whatever
it is, I'll have it.

43:20.230 --> 43:22.499
Very good, <i>madame.</i>

43:22.500 --> 43:23.967
And for <i>monsieur?</i>

43:23.968 --> 43:26.569
(STAMMERING)

43:26.570 --> 43:29.172
I'll have the steak plate.

43:29.173 --> 43:31.741
Molly, really, you don't even
need to hear what the fish is?

43:31.742 --> 43:33.109
I'm sure.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.744
I am more sure of this decision

43:34.745 --> 43:37.212

in my entire life.

43:51.528 --> 43:54.062
Dinner was great, Molly. I agree.

43:54.764 --> 43:57.465
Well, this is me.

43:58.668 --> 44:00.535
And this is me.

44:02.639 --> 44:04.707
I mean, this is me.
This is where I live.

44:04.708 --> 44:06.543
I know. And this is where I live.

44:06.544 --> 44:09.110

live, too. With me.

44:09.646 --> 44:11.147
Oh, Joel...

44:11.148 --> 44:13.316
Look, I'm just gonna throw my cards

44:13.317 --> 44:15.818
out on the table,
really go for broke.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.287
I had a great time tonight.

44:17.288 --> 44:20.056
Would you like to go for a
burrito sometime with me?

44:20.057 --> 44:22.625
No. I'm sorry, no. I wouldn't.

44:22.626 --> 44:24.761
Oh, wow, I wasn't expecting
that. That's harsh.

44:24.762 --> 44:27.063
It came out wrong. I just
don't like Mexican food.

44:27.064 --> 44:28.331
I'm sorry.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.199
You're sorry? Thought
you were Joel.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.769
- Actually, Joel is my middle name.
- Sorry is your first name?

44:32.770 --> 44:34.304
Billy is my first name.

44:34.305 --> 44:35.905
Your name is Billy Joel?

44:35.906 --> 44:41.878
Hmm... I never really thought about
that before, but yeah. I guess it is.

44:41.879 --> 44:43.611
I should probably get going.

44:44.747 --> 44:46.215
Have a good night.

44:46.216 --> 44:48.049
- Bye now.
- Wait...

44:48.585 --> 44:49.919
Yeah!

If you wanna come up,
uh, you know, you can.

44:56.159 --> 44:58.093
Shh.

44:58.695 --> 45:00.930
Don't say another word.

45:00.931 --> 45:02.664
I would love to come upstairs.

45:07.837 --> 45:09.704
Keep going.

45:18.815 --> 45:20.515
Where's your sister?

45:21.651 --> 45:23.186
She and Tucker went fly-fishing.

50:33.162 --> 50:34.964
What the fuck?

50:34.965 --> 50:38.000
Joel, have you ever thought
about how white people

50:38.001 --> 50:40.736
should be proud of their heritage,
just like other people are?

50:40.737 --> 50:41.971
No.

50:41.972 --> 50:44.040
Do you realize because
of the race mixers

50:44.041 --> 50:46.774
white people are now the
minority in this country?

50:48.311 --> 50:50.313
It's a good point.

Guys, let's not bore Joel.
Justin, how's school?

50:57.053 --> 50:59.155
How could you not tell me that your
parents were white supremacists?

50:59.156 --> 51:02.458
- I didn't think it was important, Joel.
- Not important? Are you kidding?

what? I'm dating this great girl.

I love you for who you are, Joel.
Why can't you do the same?

51:11.301 --> 51:12.668
Let me guess. The next
thing you're about to say

51:12.669 --> 51:14.670
is that it's really
hard making this work

51:14.671 --> 51:17.206
because my job entails running
your business out of business!

what I was going to say.

calm down for a second!

you're not here just because

feeling sorry for yourself.
