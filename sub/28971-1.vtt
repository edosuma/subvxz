01:39.400 --> 01:42.835
- Candidate
142, please take a seat.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.359
- Please standby.

02:50.004 --> 02:50.963
Marcus.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.906
Everything okay?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.350
Latitude.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.388
37 degrees.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.859
14, 62, North.

03:13.861 --> 03:14.893
Longitude.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.796
115 degrees.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.667
48.95, West.

03:29.143 --> 03:30.275
Please proceed.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.135
Present your findings to
the window on the right.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.680
Subject 142 shows
enormous potential.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.021
Finally, a breakthrough.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.201
Congratulations, candidates.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.037
You are successful in
reaching level six.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.277
- Warning,
facility lockdown

06:19.279 --> 06:21.646
in T-minus three minutes.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.176
- Advance
remote viewing experiment

06:51.178 --> 06:52.944
ready to commence.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.502
- Let me out!

08:23.504 --> 08:24.502
Please!

08:25.205 --> 08:26.972
Open the door!

08:28.642 --> 08:30.175
Please!

08:30.177 --> 08:32.811
What have you done to us?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.145
Please!

08:35.082 --> 08:36.313
Open the door!

08:37.384 --> 08:38.616
Open the door!

08:39.385 --> 08:40.284
Please!

08:58.438 --> 09:00.939
- Now, open your eyes, Marcus.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.777
How do you feel?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.013
- Tired.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.748
Frustrated.

09:10.784 --> 09:11.883
Angry.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.955
- I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.224
- It's very--
- Will you turn that off?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.326
It's giving me a headache.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.563
- It's very important that
you answer them honestly and

09:24.565 --> 09:25.764
with as much
clarity as possible.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.372
When did your
parents go missing?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.042
- August 8th, 1991.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.247
- And what happened to them?

09:42.249 --> 09:44.182
- I don't know.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.251
- What do you think
happened to them?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.285
- I don't.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.023
We've been through
this a hundred times.

09:52.025 --> 09:55.393
- It is my job to keep
asking you these questions.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.162
And as condition of your parole,

09:57.164 --> 09:59.130
it is your job to answer them.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.102
You have to work
with me here, Marcus.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.937
What do you think
happened to them?

10:09.459 --> 10:11.710
- I used to think they
ran away and left me.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.845
- And now?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.515
- My best guess is they're dead.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.250
- And how does
that make you feel?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.151
- Sad.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.954
- Sad in what way?

10:24.891 --> 10:28.426
- Sad because I'll never know
what really happened to them.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.096
Or what really happened to me.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.399
- Are your eyes
bothering you again?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.103
I'm gonna write you
up something for that.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.141
What about Sara, any contact?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.275
- I'm not allowed.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.612
- That hasn't stopped
you in the past.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.347
- No.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.215
None.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.854
- Let's talk about
what happened that day.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.156
- I told you, I don't remember.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.558
- Please try.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.434
- I woke up from a bad dream.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.804
I had a thumping headache.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.575
I went downstairs
to get some aspirin.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.178
I heard something.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.449
- What did you hear?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.052
- Voices.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.060
- What did they say?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.538
- I can't remember.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.974
When I came to, the
police were there

11:51.078 --> 11:52.711
and the whole room
was destroyed.

11:57.984 --> 11:58.983
How is she?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.086
- You know I'm not
allowed to discuss

12:01.088 --> 12:02.520
my other patients with you.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.657
- But she still is your patient?

12:08.528 --> 12:09.761
- She's doing fine.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.163
- Let's talk about
these headaches.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.531
Are you still having them?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.468
- They're less frequent,

12:16.470 --> 12:18.870
but I can't seem to
focus on anything.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.840
- There's always going
to be side effects.

12:22.976 --> 12:23.908
The important thing
is that we're moving

12:23.910 --> 12:25.777
forward in the right direction.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.349
You made a lot of progress
in six months, Marcus.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.118
- How much longer do
I have to take them?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.887
For the moment, we're gonna
take it one step at a time.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.989
and if you keep
progressing it will

12:37.991 --> 12:39.657
be sooner rather than later.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.628
Okay, I think that's
enough for today.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.965
I'm gonna write you up
something for your eyes.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.202
And Marcus,

12:52.339 --> 12:55.140
you'll get through
this, I promise.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.157
- I just wanna talk.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.992
- Yeah, well I don't.

13:15.028 --> 13:15.927
- Please.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.596
I don't have anyone else.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.900
- You shouldn't be here.

13:22.936 --> 13:23.902
- I'm sorry, Sara.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.406
I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.009
- Yeah, well you did.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.443
You did hurt me, Marcus!

13:32.445 --> 13:33.311
- I know.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.750
You have every right to hate me.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.222
- I don't hate you.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.693
I'm scared of you.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.401
You should leave.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.468
- I'm getting help.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.310
I'm seeing a therapist.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.544
It seems to be working.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.380
And you were right.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.884
I should have done
that a long time ago.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.855
- Okay, well, I'm
glad to hear that.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.723
I really am.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.360
I'm glad you're getting help.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.996
But that doesn't change the
fact that you came here.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.298
You can't just come
to my house, Marcus.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.000
I have a restraining
order against you.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.735
Do you understand what
a restraining order is?

14:30.737 --> 14:32.503
Do you understand
what that means?

14:33.607 --> 14:34.939
You don't care if
you go to jail?

14:36.443 --> 14:37.642
- I miss you.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.011
- That's not fair.

14:40.981 --> 14:41.880
- Are you happy?

14:52.325 --> 14:54.492
- You should leave
before James gets home.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.020
- Marcus?

17:03.757 --> 17:04.655
Marcus?

17:08.661 --> 17:09.560
Marcus?

17:10.797 --> 17:12.163
- Sorry.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.064
Sorry.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.599
- I lost you again, didn't I?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.570
So what do you think?

17:20.573 --> 17:21.705
- About what?

17:22.909 --> 17:25.209
- The next step
in your recovery.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.384
This belongs to you.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.226
It's the key to
your parent's cabin.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.704
- How did you get this?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.907
- I contacted your trust,

17:55.909 --> 17:58.543
told them you were going
up there for a couple days,

17:58.545 --> 18:01.345
and they had a courier
send it over to my office.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.214
We leave first thing
in the morning.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.583
- Tomorrow?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.351
- Do you need more time?

18:07.353 --> 18:08.653
- No, no, no, no, it's fine.

18:08.655 --> 18:09.921
It's just a surprise.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.923
- I need you to
pack some clothes.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.791
I want you to stay
for a few days.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.329
I think this is gonna
be good for you, Marcus.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.297
Who knows?

18:20.366 --> 18:21.532
Maybe it will jog
some of those memories

18:21.534 --> 18:23.468
you've got locked up so tight.

19:07.947 --> 19:08.946
You alright?

19:10.617 --> 19:13.918
- Looks different
from how I remember.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.786
- It's been a long time.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.256
You've got my number.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.691
If you need anything,
give me a call.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.860
Other than that, see
you in a couple days.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.003
- Jillian?

19:32.005 --> 19:33.471
- Yeah.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.405
- Thank you.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.374
- Good luck.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.928
- Hey,
you've reached Sara.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.763
Leave a message and I'll get
back to you soon as possible.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.098
- The serum intended
to enhance the subject's

26:08.100 --> 26:12.770
psychic abilities has resulted
in terrifying side effects.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.239
I can't be certain but it
would appear the experiment

26:15.241 --> 26:16.807
has attracted some kind of.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.915
Right now I have more
questions than answers.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.585
One certainty I have is that I.

26:34.527 --> 26:36.727
Some of his drawings
suggest that these

26:36.729 --> 26:39.029
things have already
made contact with him.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.564
I don't know if
this is a glimpse--

26:40.566 --> 26:41.765
- What did
I say about playing

26:41.767 --> 26:44.568
with Dad's recording,
you little monkey?

26:44.570 --> 26:47.972
If I let you go to work with
Daddy, you promise to be good?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.273
- Of
course, he's going.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.075
He's my little helper.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.643
- You
hear that, Marcus?

26:52.645 --> 26:54.945
Your Dad wants you to help him.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.047
- Marcus,
give me the recording.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.216
Happy birthday to you.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.086
Happy birthday, dear Marcus.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.921
Happy birthday to you.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.490
Quick, blow out
the candles, son.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.960
- Marcus?

29:05.578 --> 29:06.910
Down the hatch.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.251
- Down the hatch.

29:58.097 --> 30:03.167
Fuck!

32:39.024 --> 32:39.923
Oh.

33:03.949 --> 33:06.016
- Subject 142 has
displayed remote viewing

33:06.018 --> 33:09.553
abilities far beyond anything
I've ever seen before.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.289
Progress so far has
been slow, too slow

33:12.291 --> 33:13.890
for my superiors as they are now

33:13.892 --> 33:16.760
insisting I introduce
the newly-created serum.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.429
The psychic stimulator has yet

33:19.431 --> 33:20.964
to be tested successfully on--

33:22.534 --> 33:24.234
Two of my staff have been killed

33:24.236 --> 33:26.570
trying to subdue the subject.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.006
Unfortunately, our
female military volunteer

33:29.008 --> 33:32.175
has suffered some kind
of fatal side effect.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.044
Marcus is now the entity's only

33:34.046 --> 33:36.446
means of entering this world.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.148
I've hidden the
last of my serum and

33:38.150 --> 33:40.617
destroyed all of my research.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.020
I can only pray that if
they're here and if they can't

33:43.022 --> 33:45.455
successfully do it through 142,

33:45.457 --> 33:47.090
they will try to complete their

33:47.092 --> 33:49.292
transition to our
world through my son.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.567
Lasting side effects.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.175
- Marcus.

34:06.879 --> 34:07.778
- Hello?

34:33.205 --> 34:35.105
- Marcus.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.498
- Dad?

35:28.494 --> 35:29.392
- Marcus.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.031
- Hello?

38:24.469 --> 38:25.902
- Marcus?

38:25.904 --> 38:27.470
Marcus, are you in there?

38:28.340 --> 38:29.539
- Sara?

38:29.541 --> 38:30.607
- Yeah, it's me.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.275
Can you please open the door?

38:33.178 --> 38:34.778
- What are you doing here?

38:35.881 --> 38:37.881
- Well, let me
in and I'll explain.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.650
- How do I know
you're really you?

38:40.652 --> 38:41.551
- What?

38:42.387 --> 38:44.254
- How do I know it's you?

38:44.256 --> 38:45.989
- Marcus, this
is fucking ridiculous.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.458
Just open the goddamn door.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.727
- What did I get you
for your last birthday?

38:52.197 --> 38:53.830
What did I get you?

38:55.367 --> 38:58.601
- Fine, you bought
me a terrible necklace

38:58.603 --> 39:02.105
with this bedazzled teddy
bear on it and I hated it,

39:02.107 --> 39:05.608
but I wore it anyways
because I loved you.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.510
Now, please open the door.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.347
Marcus!

39:31.136 --> 39:32.802
Jesus.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.237
You look like shit.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.488
What is this?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.724
Marcus, what's going on?

39:54.726 --> 39:57.160
- Sara, what are you doing here?

39:57.162 --> 39:59.062
- Didn't Dr. Martin call you?

40:02.834 --> 40:04.567
She thought it might be helpful

40:04.569 --> 40:06.469
for you to see a familiar face.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.072
- She told you I was here?

40:09.074 --> 40:12.675
- Yes, she explained
everything to me.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.811
She's worried about you.

40:16.815 --> 40:17.714
And.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.482
So am I.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.222
All this time alone.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.592
- What are you talking about?

40:30.462 --> 40:31.895
I got here yesterday.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.733
- Marcus, you've been
up here for a week.

40:42.974 --> 40:43.840
Hey.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.709
I'm here to help you.

40:47.813 --> 40:48.878
I wanna help you.

40:51.082 --> 40:51.948
Just.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.350
Let me in.

41:07.699 --> 41:12.769
So you found this in a box
inside a hole in the woods?

41:18.610 --> 41:19.576
Yeah, okay.

41:22.414 --> 41:23.680
Well.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.148
What was it doing there?

41:25.150 --> 41:27.450
- That was hidden on purpose.

41:27.452 --> 41:29.419
Okay, that was hidden
there by my dad.

41:30.455 --> 41:32.121
- How do you know that?

41:33.358 --> 41:34.424
- I just do.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.564
- You have no idea
what this stuff is.

41:41.566 --> 41:43.833
I mean, it could be poisonous.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.135
You have no clue how
even old this is.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.711
You didn't take any
of this did you?

42:00.685 --> 42:01.551
Did you?

42:04.389 --> 42:06.089
- That could be
the key to finding

42:06.091 --> 42:08.625
out what happened to them.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.126
What happened to me.

42:13.365 --> 42:14.597
- And anyone answer?

42:14.599 --> 42:15.865
- Yes, someone answers!

42:18.236 --> 42:20.837
They just left me, Sara.

42:20.839 --> 42:24.307
I was a little boy
and they just left me.

42:25.377 --> 42:26.943
What if I did something wrong?

42:28.246 --> 42:29.178
What if this is my fault?

42:29.180 --> 42:30.947
- We have discussed this.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.916
It is not your fault.

42:35.353 --> 42:37.120
I see you still have a
lot you need to work on.

42:37.122 --> 42:38.922
- What do you think
I'm doing here?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.826
- You know what, this is.

42:43.828 --> 42:45.828
This is not the right
setting for this.

42:47.299 --> 42:48.197
I should go.

42:49.267 --> 42:52.335
We will discuss this
at a later time.

42:56.174 --> 42:57.040
- Wait.

42:59.511 --> 43:00.343
Let me show you.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.350
It was here, it was right here.

43:08.553 --> 43:09.953
- What was?

43:09.955 --> 43:10.787
- It was a hatch.

43:10.789 --> 43:11.688
- A hatch?

43:13.224 --> 43:15.391
- Yeah, he led me here.

43:16.528 --> 43:17.427
- Who did?

43:18.597 --> 43:19.495
- My dad.

43:22.701 --> 43:24.634
- Marcus, there's.

43:24.636 --> 43:25.969
There's nothing here.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.870
- It was, it was here.

43:30.175 --> 43:31.074
- Hey.

43:32.611 --> 43:33.509
Hey.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.112
It's okay, come on.

43:36.114 --> 43:41.184
Let's go home.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.553
Let's go home.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.196
What's wrong?

43:54.332 --> 43:55.798
Marcus, you okay?

43:57.769 --> 43:59.435
What's going on,
just talk to me.

44:00.972 --> 44:02.271
Stop, what are you doing?

44:03.975 --> 44:05.008
Marcus, where are you going?

44:05.010 --> 44:06.676
What are you doing?

44:08.847 --> 44:10.580
Stop fucking around, Marcus.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.218
Marcus, come here and talk.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.552
Let's go home, please.

44:18.056 --> 44:19.822
Stop looking at me like that!

44:21.059 --> 44:22.191
Marcus, talk to me.

44:24.229 --> 44:25.428
Marcus!

44:25.430 --> 44:26.362
Stop!

44:26.364 --> 44:27.397
Marcus!

44:27.399 --> 44:28.898
Marcus!

44:29.968 --> 44:30.867
Marcus!

44:32.437 --> 44:33.336
Marcus!

44:39.644 --> 44:40.543
Marcus!

44:48.119 --> 44:49.018
Marcus!

45:54.252 --> 45:55.852
Why did you do that?

45:59.424 --> 46:00.556
You just left me.

46:02.527 --> 46:03.960
Stop the bullshit, Marcus.

46:03.962 --> 46:04.861
I.

46:13.805 --> 46:16.372
You took some, didn't you?

46:26.951 --> 46:28.384
You lied to me!

46:31.856 --> 46:33.289
Answer me!

46:38.096 --> 46:41.230
Answer me!

46:41.232 --> 46:43.499
- No, you answer me.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.135
What the fuck are you?

46:48.106 --> 46:48.938
- Stop it, Marcus.

46:48.940 --> 46:49.839
You're scaring me.

46:49.841 --> 46:51.340
- Good.

46:51.342 --> 46:53.476
I'm tired of being the only
one around here who's scared.

46:54.445 --> 46:55.278
Come on.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.112
- Ow!

46:56.114 --> 46:57.013
- Hey.
- Ow!

46:57.015 --> 46:58.014
You're hurting me.

46:59.384 --> 47:00.416
Let go.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.084
Marcus, let go!

47:14.132 --> 47:15.031
- Sara?

48:21.399 --> 48:22.298
No.

48:27.705 --> 48:28.604
Oh no.

48:44.923 --> 48:45.855
Oh, no.

48:45.857 --> 48:46.722
No.

48:52.563 --> 48:53.462
Oh.

48:55.667 --> 48:56.565
Oh.

48:59.904 --> 49:00.770
Sorry.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.012
Shh.

49:10.014 --> 49:11.447
Don't speak, don't speak.

49:16.087 --> 49:18.587
I'll get help, I'll get help.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.523
Ah, fuck.

49:39.944 --> 49:42.278
- 911,
what's your emergency?

49:42.280 --> 49:43.746
- There's been an accident.

49:43.748 --> 49:44.714
Someone's been stabbed and
they're losing a lot of blood.

49:44.716 --> 49:46.182
Please, come and help us.

49:46.184 --> 49:48.484
Ugh, that sounds terrible.

49:48.486 --> 49:49.318
Please hold.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.753
- What the fuck?

49:50.755 --> 49:52.588
Thank you for waiting, sir.

49:52.590 --> 49:53.756
How can I be of assistance?

49:53.758 --> 49:55.291
- She's been fucking
stabbed, okay?

49:55.293 --> 49:58.294
Just get an ambulance out
here as quick as you can.

49:58.296 --> 49:59.528
Please hold!

49:59.530 --> 50:02.131
- What, you can't
be fucking serious!

50:02.133 --> 50:03.466
Sara, hold on, hold on, hold on.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.302
Why do you keep
putting me on hold?

50:06.304 --> 50:08.904
- Is
your friend still alive?

50:08.906 --> 50:10.339
- Yes, but barely.

50:10.341 --> 50:11.874
Look, she's losing
a lot of blood.

50:11.876 --> 50:14.310
- Then I
suggest you finish the job!

50:16.280 --> 50:17.179
- What?

50:18.916 --> 50:21.484
- Cut her
throat, end her suffering.

50:21.486 --> 50:22.918
You can't save her now.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.320
- What the fuck?

50:25.590 --> 50:27.890
Who the fuck is this?

50:27.892 --> 50:29.925
Please hold!

50:29.927 --> 50:34.630
- Fuck!

51:13.971 --> 51:14.904
Do you still

51:14.906 --> 51:17.339
require medical assistance?

51:17.341 --> 51:18.274
- Fuck you!

52:37.889 --> 52:39.188
- Marcus?

52:44.862 --> 52:45.728
Marcus.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.123
- Mom?

53:14.125 --> 53:15.624
- I'm here.

53:15.626 --> 53:17.726
No, don't open the door.

53:17.728 --> 53:19.995
Just listen to my voice.

53:19.997 --> 53:21.864
You have to trust me.

53:21.866 --> 53:23.766
It will try and confuse you.

53:24.869 --> 53:26.101
- Who are they?

53:26.103 --> 53:27.736
- They need you,
but you mustn't fall

53:27.738 --> 53:29.205
for their tricks.

53:29.207 --> 53:30.372
You must be strong.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.008
- Mom, I'm so scared.

53:34.745 --> 53:37.680
- Without you,
they are nothing.

53:37.682 --> 53:40.015
Nothing is as it seems.

53:40.017 --> 53:41.250
- Mom.

53:41.252 --> 53:43.452
- They're coming
for you, save yourself.

53:44.689 --> 53:46.655
I love you, darling.

53:46.657 --> 53:49.658

What is this a
picture of, Marcus?

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.612
- I don't know.

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.414
It's only the drawing.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.582
- Who did?

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:08.716
- The man in my head.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:14.622
- Never mention this
to anyone, okay, son?

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:23.331
I told you I didn't
wanna be disturbed.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:26.000
I don't care what she said.

01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:28.269
I run this facility not
her, and if you value

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.037
your job you will
keep her there.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.073
Under no circumstances
do I want her down here.

01:08:33.076 --> 01:08:34.609
Do I make myself clear?

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.483
- Where is he?

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.518
You take me to him right now.

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:46.386
The nightmares.

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:48.189
He's drawing the most
horrific monsters.

01:08:48.191 --> 01:08:49.323
It's all you!

01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:54.229
- Mary, you
don't understand.

01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.630
Where is he?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.198
- I can't.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.801
- What have
you been doing to him?

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.706
- Mary, stop.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.674
We have to continue
his treatment.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.076
It's the only way to stop this.

01:09:08.078 --> 01:09:10.745
- I can take care of him, I can.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:11.979
Let me go.

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:13.180
- I won't let you go.

01:09:13.183 --> 01:09:14.082
He needs this.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:18.920
- Don't come any
closer, I mean it.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:21.823
- Oh, Mary.

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:23.491
We don't have time for this.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.993
Please, put down the gun.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:27.261
Look at me.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.200
I would never do anything
to hurt you or Marcus.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:33.968
I love you both.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.203
You know that?

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.971
- This doesn't make
any sense, Andrew.

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.207
Why?

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.675
- You have to trust me.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.377
They're coming for him.

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:44.578
- Enough, get out of my way.

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:46.447
- Just give me the gun.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.252
No, no!

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.988
Oh, god, no!

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:55.623
Mary!

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:56.524
Oh!

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.235
Marcus.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.476
Come here, son.

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:17.612
It's okay.

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:29.958
You're special, Marcus.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.793
Don't ever forget that.

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:33.995
You remember our secret way out?

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:35.463
The one I should you.

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:38.566
You run as fast as you can
and you never look back, okay?

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:41.736
I love you, son.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.746
Now, go.

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:52.614
Go!

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:23.678
You can't take my boy!

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:47.335
I have
concocted a special formula

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:50.538
in hopes that it will suppress
Marcus's psychic abilities.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.206
My only hope is that
this will be enough

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:55.576
to sever the tie between
him and the entities.

01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:57.512
Long enough for me
to get him to safety.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:12:00.548
The serum could have
long-lasting side effects

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:04.319
on him mentally and could
possibly lead to psychosis.

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:07.922
I just need more time to perfect
it, to make it more safe.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:12.126
But time's up and I can't
think of any other solution.

01:12:12.128 --> 01:12:15.163
Since the termination of
Subject 142, Marcus is now the

01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:18.833
entity's only means of
entering this world.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.401
I've hidden the last of my serum

01:12:20.403 --> 01:12:22.637
and destroyed all
of my research.

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:26.274
I can only pray I've done
enough to stop these things.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:18.686
- Marcus.

Just do as they ask and go home.

01:15:40.203 --> 01:15:42.436
They promised to let us go.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.472
They wanna help you.

01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:47.875
Please, if you love
me just let them in.

01:16:50.173 --> 01:16:53.908
- Now open
your eyes to us, Marcus.

01:17:19.702 --> 01:17:20.901
- It's a good painting.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:24.672
The pallet is
somewhat rudimentary.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:27.274
And your use of shading
leaves a lot to be desired.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:32.246
But the central figure, it's
like looking in a mirror.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:34.749
- Who are you?

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:36.617
- I'm you.

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:39.620
Did the face not give it away?

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:41.555
- What?

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:45.159
- You're only half
a man, Marcus.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.962
Stunted, cleft, pulled asunder.

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:51.866
Your potential left
abandoned in the woods.

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.005
Pitiful.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.541
Always looking for the escape.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.981
Adversity is the
first path to truth.

01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:09.617
- What truth?

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:16.891
- That you feel
hopeless, lost, confused.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.294
You exist in a
state of abeyance,

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.596
unwilling to express
your true potency.

01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:25.566
You felt it once.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:28.836
- No.

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:31.639
- You only deny yourself.

01:18:33.076 --> 01:18:34.375
You want to help us.

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.278
You've always wanted to help us.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:51.158

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:22.803
- Of course, it's real.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:27.908
You left a message on my phone.

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:30.311
Remember?

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:32.746
That's why I'm here.

01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:36.583

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:37.618

01:22:45.895 --> 01:22:48.329
Remember what we once had?

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.497
You can have all of it.

01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:54.501
Just take my hand.

01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:10.751

Sara would never say that.

- We only want what's
best for you, darling.

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:27.668
We all do.

01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:56.096
Marcus, put down the knife.

01:24:09.645 --> 01:24:10.544

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:14.181
you die.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:18.719
