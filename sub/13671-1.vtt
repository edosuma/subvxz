00:01.440 --> 00:03.120
                  This latest fiasco,

00:03.120 --> 00:05.400
Morrison came back
looking like
an anchovy pizza.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.920
I know
my programs fail.

00:07.920 --> 00:11.120
I put that boy
on the plane.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.880
I feel
the responsibility.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.240
Who's coming back
for third year?

00:15.240 --> 00:16.680
You'll
know tomorrow.

00:16.680 --> 00:20.680
Know what it's like
going through life
not being well-liked?

00:20.800 --> 00:24.800
I hate it!

02:38.160 --> 02:42.160
Even I'd be big
in that place.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.960
Hey, Darth,
hold that 'vator.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.360
Excuse me.
Watch your toes.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.360
Third floor, please.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.360
When the heat's on,

02:59.360 --> 03:03.200
you should use
a double blast of deodorant.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.160
Don't think about it.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.160
This is the hospital's most
important piece of equipment.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.640
         (KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:13.640 --> 03:16.000
Come on in.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.160
Luther.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.560
I got it.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.920
At last. I ordered this
months ago.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.760
Too small for
the new magnetic
resonance scanner.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.160
How about
an air conditioner?

03:28.160 --> 03:30.040
A reprieve from summer.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.520
Thank you, Daniel.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.960
Set it up.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.560
We should have
picked him up
with the medical van.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.320
He didn't want
a fuss made.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.040
I can't wait to see
Father McCabe again.

03:44.040 --> 03:48.040
In two days,
he goes to that
retirement home.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.800
He supported me
so much growing up.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.160
I need
his advice again.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.040
Let's go meet him.

03:56.040 --> 04:00.040
I'll stop by
Mark's office.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.640
Be cool.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.960
For crying out loud.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.120
(KNOCK)

04:26.120 --> 04:27.520
Get in here.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.960
Mark, it's time.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.360
For what?

04:30.360 --> 04:33.280
Father McCabe.
We have a problem.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.360
What?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.840
Mr Lukas.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.280
Who's that?

04:37.280 --> 04:38.720
Bilateral
interstitial
pneumonia.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.640
His condition's
gotten worse.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.040
I'm putting him
on antibiotics.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.360
He needs an
open-lung biopsy.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.320
What are you doing?

04:48.320 --> 04:50.560
What does it look like?

04:50.560 --> 04:53.200
Let me help.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
My hand's healing
remarkably well.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.560
I'll be back at
full throttle next week.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.680
Excelsior.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.080
Spare me your
Latin platitudes.

05:03.080 --> 05:07.080
No. Excelsior.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.400
My cushing left anterior
descending artery award.

05:11.400 --> 05:15.240
Ellen broke the old one
playing interior decorator.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.640
Mark, will you
never learn?

05:17.640 --> 05:21.640
I never permit
Katharine to touch
my private things.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.320
Yeah, well...
forgive and forget.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.760
Ellen's under stress.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.640
I'm getting her
out of town.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.560
We're going to Philly.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.440
Stroll down
memory lane.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.440
I want to see where
my alumni dollars are going.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.640
Coming to see
Father McCabe?

05:40.640 --> 05:44.640
In a minute.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.240
"Sam McCulloch,
see the cashier."

05:50.240 --> 05:51.680
Lunch today?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.080
I've got
a vasectomy patient.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.040
Don't order
grilled capon.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.400
What's the deal?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.280
What will you say?

05:59.280 --> 06:00.560
About what?

06:00.560 --> 06:04.160
You won't let
the poor slob do it?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.600
The sky's falling.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.480
What's wrong,
chicken little?

06:07.480 --> 06:10.360
I was sitting
in my car.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.360
Next thing I know,
the roof caves in.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.040
Why didn't I go
to Boston General?

06:18.040 --> 06:19.840
What fell on you?

06:19.840 --> 06:23.840
An air conditioner.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.680
(THUD)

06:37.160 --> 06:41.160
(THUD)

07:02.840 --> 07:06.840
Aah!

07:19.880 --> 07:23.880
Oh, my god.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.400
Code blue in the morgue.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.400
Yeah, I'm serious.
I need help, stat.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.800
Donald, stop feeling
sorry for yourself.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.800
I ain't
boxing with you.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.760
You'll have pain and
disappointment your whole life.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.760
Face it, or you'll
get beat up every time.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.760
Now let's go.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.040
I know you love
your family, Donald.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.440
It's been 10 years.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.440
It's time to go on.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.040
There's no reason
for what happened.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.680
It hurts growing up.

08:30.680 --> 08:34.679
I'll show you hurt.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.400
# When the saints
go marchin' in

08:46.400 --> 08:50.400
# Oh, when the saints
go marchin' in

08:52.480 --> 08:54.200
# Bom bom bom bom. #

08:54.200 --> 08:56.600
It's nice
to see you.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.960
You're a sight
for sore eyes yourself.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.960
Hug me, lad.
I won't break.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.400
Meet Proud Eagle,
my nursemaid.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.280
My arms, my legs,
my friend.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.240
Donald Westphall.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.240
That was once five years old
with tousled hair.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.720
St Eligius hasn't aged
any better than me.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.160
Let's go inside.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.120
First trip
to Boston?

09:23.120 --> 09:27.120
He's dying to see Fenway.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.000
Joseph.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.040
Oh, Daniel.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.600
How are you?

09:32.600 --> 09:36.600
Proud Eagle,
if you please.

09:45.040 --> 09:49.040
Get him
on the table.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.600
Where's the chart?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.560
Check the toe tag.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.000
Looks like
he's coming around.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Get a gurney.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.960
Who got cut from
the residency program?

10:05.960 --> 10:08.360
Litvak's gone.
That punk, Brewster.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.560
Get this -
O'Brien from surgery.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.560
She find
another hospital?

10:12.560 --> 10:13.360
Yeah. New York.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.600
She won't
last 13 weeks.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.440
We've broken new ground.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.440
We brought one
back from the dead.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.040
We had this
made for you.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.840
Now you can take
St Eligius with you.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.840
I've got a confession
for you, boys.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
After my checkup here,

10:37.040 --> 10:41.040
I'm going to the home for
useless and discarded priests...

10:41.120 --> 10:45.120
and die.

10:51.440 --> 10:55.440
Anybody home?

11:11.440 --> 11:15.200
Like to see
our new magnetic
resonance scanner?

11:15.200 --> 11:17.600
Sounds grand.
What is it?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.000
A more advanced
CAT scan.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.920
Full operation
begins tomorrow.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.840
In the old days,

11:23.840 --> 11:27.160
with new hardware,
we said a prayer.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.320
Will you preside over
a dedication ceremony?

11:30.320 --> 11:31.760
I'd be honored.

11:31.760 --> 11:34.600
Like to see
the scanner now?

11:34.600 --> 11:38.080
Let's see
the surgical suites.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.800
Who's chief of surgery
now that Domedion's gone?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.360
Mark Craig.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.360
You're joking.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.640
Luther,
I still need--

11:54.640 --> 11:55.800
Later.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.120
Later?

11:59.120 --> 12:01.360
Jenkins was
DOA, Jack.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.280
And he became
AAKAA--

12:03.280 --> 12:05.680
alive and kicking
after arrival.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.560
Blame whoever
wheeled him

12:07.560 --> 12:09.520
to the morgue
originally

12:09.520 --> 12:10.920
or the dealer

12:10.920 --> 12:12.360
or his mother,

12:12.360 --> 12:14.400
but don't blame me.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.000
My dream - living
in video village.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.920
Admit you
screwed up.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.920
At most,
because I'm just
back from vacation,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.320
I'm a little rusty.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.520
You're not
a little anything.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.800
Hardy-har-yuk.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.440
There's only
a few pieces missing.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.680
Like Monty Hall.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.080
At least
he survived.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.320
Survived?
He was on 10 years.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.720
You wouldn't believe

12:39.720 --> 12:42.120
what was in
my parents' attic.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.520
My whole youth...
in boxes.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.880
20 years,
perfectly preserved.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.280
It helped me
find myself.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.160
Great.
You owe Â¤500.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.120
Double sixes
on the dice.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.120
At first, I hated
coming back to Boston.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.160
Tell me
about it.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.280
OK.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.280
We choose to leave
our families, right?

13:05.320 --> 13:07.560
We discover ourselves
as individuals.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.760
When we decide
to go home,

13:10.760 --> 13:13.480
we get taken care of.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.440
At St Eligius,
it's the same thing.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.840
You're my family, too,

13:18.840 --> 13:22.840
you know?

13:25.320 --> 13:27.720
We're doing this
by numbers,

13:27.720 --> 13:30.760
so ask questions
if you like.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.880
OK.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.160
OK.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.600
I finished
shaving

13:34.600 --> 13:38.280
the area
of incision.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.680
This may bite
a little,

13:40.680 --> 13:43.960
and it's going to
get tres hot

13:43.960 --> 13:46.200
for about 10 seconds.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.160
Waah!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.480
Mississippi 2,
mississippi 3...

13:49.480 --> 13:51.320
Almost done.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.720
You didn't attend

13:52.720 --> 13:55.640
a mail-order
Caribbean med school,

13:55.640 --> 13:57.240
did you?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.360
Si.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.680
You'll be done
momentarily.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.840
You have told me
everything, right?

14:03.840 --> 14:07.840
Scrotal sac and penis
may turn black and blue.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.200
You kidding?
For how long?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.960
Ooh, week or two.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.240
Little oozing of blood
from the incision.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.000
Scabbing,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.960
swelling in the cords,
marble-sized.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.360
Anything else?

14:23.360 --> 14:26.960
This procedure almost
always goes right.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.960
And if it doesn't?

14:28.960 --> 14:32.960
Well, we're talking
grapefruits.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.800
Great thing about
Lou Gehrig's disease,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.760
you never get tired.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.160
You're always tired.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.600
Quite a hitter.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.600
That's an admission
from a Red Sox fan.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.080
Would you like
your pajamas?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.520
Not yet, thanks.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.960
As for you,

14:51.960 --> 14:55.800
I trained a doctor,
not a tour guide.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.200
Don't you
do medicine here?

14:58.200 --> 15:01.400
You'll see firsthand
as guest star.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.360
Guinea pig,
you mean.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.960
See you later.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.000
Take my sweater now,
Proud Eagle.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.400
I'll be toddling
along myself.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.680
Wait a bit,
would you?

15:12.680 --> 15:15.960
I was the youngest
of 11.

15:15.960 --> 15:19.960
It took me 90 years,
but I'm a baby again.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.800
In 1955,

15:21.800 --> 15:25.640
when I was drop-kicked
out of this hospital,

15:25.640 --> 15:29.520
I landed on my face
in the Arizona Desert.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.960
A Boston potato
transplanted to sand.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.920
I thought I'd rot.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.440
I thought St Eligius
would, too.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.120
Oh, no, you've
done beautifully.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.120
We're known as
St Elsewhere,

15:41.120 --> 15:42.800
a dumping ground.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.760
I went southwest
full of aggression

15:45.760 --> 15:49.360
to improve the lot
of the tribe.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.160
How noble of you.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.880
Once I was standing
in the foundation

15:53.880 --> 15:56.440
of a school
we were building,

15:56.440 --> 15:58.440
impatient because
the wheelbarrows

15:58.440 --> 16:00.360
were full of bricks.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.760
I looked up

16:01.760 --> 16:05.600
and saw the beauty
of the sunrise obscured.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.000
Desert storms
don't come often,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.960
but when they do,

16:09.960 --> 16:13.080
oomaw, you-I-umpta,
as the Hopis say.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.560
Scaffolding,
bricks, dirt
blowing everywhere.

16:15.560 --> 16:17.560
And just as suddenly,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.080
the tempest passed,

16:19.080 --> 16:21.960
leaving all my work
in chaos,

16:21.960 --> 16:25.320
but the desert
was still the same--

16:25.320 --> 16:28.760
peaceful, eternal...

16:28.760 --> 16:31.680
It is time for
Dr Auschlander's
present?

16:31.680 --> 16:35.680
That's why I
asked you to wait.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.480
Since you're the chief
of services,

16:42.480 --> 16:46.480
we thought you deserve
this Cheyenne headdress.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.600
Oh, goodness.
Goodness.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.360
How do I look?

16:52.360 --> 16:56.360
Like Calvin Coolidge.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.839
Mark, vacation
means relax.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.359
Already you're
hustling me
down the street.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.040
I'm not sitting
in the suite.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.960
But why tour the
university hospital?

17:14.960 --> 17:17.359
Would Margaret Thatcher
visit Washington

17:17.359 --> 17:21.000
and not drop in
at the White House?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.760
Anyone particular
you want to see?

17:23.760 --> 17:25.160
Todd Sweeney.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.280
Who?

17:26.280 --> 17:30.160
You know, Sweeney,
the specialist.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.560
Uh-huh.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.400
Ok, let's see
good old Todd.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.360
I didn't invite you.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.560
I thought we were
on holiday together.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.400
You've always hated
this hospital, remember?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.360
You going to relive

17:44.360 --> 17:47.720
blowing homecoming dinner
all over the ER?

17:47.720 --> 17:50.120
Ok, I'll go
to Houston Hall.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.160
Don't buy me
another tie.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.360
I was planning
to shop for Barbara.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.360
We should have
brought her.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.320
This is
our weekend.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.240
The Galeckis
need time

18:01.240 --> 18:03.360
with their
granddaughter, too.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.560
Smokey Joe's
in one hour.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.920
Mark, can't you
imagine a bib--

18:07.920 --> 18:09.280
class 2007?

18:09.280 --> 18:11.800
She's going
to Harvard!

18:11.800 --> 18:15.800
She's not making
the mistake I made.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.320
Can anyone explain
amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis?

18:28.320 --> 18:31.680
The nerves that
stimulate the muscles
degenerate.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.080
The brain loses
its ability

18:34.080 --> 18:35.960
to direct
muscle movement,

18:35.960 --> 18:38.040
creating weakness
and atrophy.

18:38.040 --> 18:42.040
In reality, it's
a pain in the keister.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.400
In 5%
of the cases,

18:45.400 --> 18:47.840
ALS seems
to be inherited.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.760
Each child is 50-50
to develop the disease.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.720
So in my case,

18:53.720 --> 18:57.360
celibacy was
at least good
for something.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.960
Hope, there's
always hope,

18:58.960 --> 19:01.000
and where
there's hope,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.600
there's Crosby.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.720
Recently I read
that with genetic
engineering,

19:05.720 --> 19:09.560
isolating
the aberrant gene
may be possible.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.840
In Arizona
I tried everything,

19:11.840 --> 19:13.600
including
snake venom.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.360
We should
let you rest.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.280
It's an honor
meeting you, sir.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.520
You interns...
I mean, residents.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.320
You're the soul
of this building.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.720
That's why we made
St Eligius

19:26.720 --> 19:29.360
a teaching hospital.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.960
Youth will always
pulse through
these halls.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.480
If I could,

19:34.480 --> 19:37.840
I'd raise my hands
to bless you.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.240
Take my word for it.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.280
I wish you
the joy of healing

19:43.280 --> 19:45.960
and the joy
of good limerick.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.520
Bye, Father.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.760
I want to chew
the fat later.

19:50.760 --> 19:54.760
All right.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.000
I feel sorry
for him.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.200
He's too vital
to pity.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.400
Luther, thanks
for installing
the air conditioner.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.800
Don't mention it...
to anyone.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.920
Dr. Morrison,
outside of environment,

20:07.920 --> 20:11.760
what else
could cause ALS?

20:11.760 --> 20:13.240
Excuse me, sir.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.480
You don't know?

20:14.480 --> 20:17.040
Viruses are a suspected
possible factor,

20:17.040 --> 20:19.400
also inborn errors
of metabolism

20:19.400 --> 20:21.720
producing abnormal
forms of hormones

20:21.720 --> 20:23.680
and other
body chemicals.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.600
Excellent.
Welcome back.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.600
Rounds are over.
Thank you.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.840
Hi.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.240
You're here.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.680
Yeah.

20:38.680 --> 20:39.880
Why?

20:39.880 --> 20:43.880
I changed my mind.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.320
Here are the tickets.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.920
How's Joe behaving?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.280
He's as positive
as I remember him.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.240
He puts on
a good show.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.800
But he's really
very depressed.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.040
Since his illness
was diagnosed,

21:06.040 --> 21:09.040
he's been talking
about the past.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.960
That's
to be expected.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.960
Not from McCabe.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.600
He lives
for the future.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.120
Sometimes I think

21:17.120 --> 21:20.760
that if Joe
could manage it,

21:20.760 --> 21:24.760
he'd kill himself.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.840
You hit a picture?

21:33.840 --> 21:36.200
Yeah. I shattered
the glass.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.120
I went immediately
to Boston General.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.040
Endowed up
the wazoo,

21:42.040 --> 21:45.400
and what do
they have to show?

21:45.400 --> 21:48.080
A Minor League
emergency facility.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.440
Why didn't you go
to your hospital?

21:51.440 --> 21:54.240
Oland Stanley's
got a big mouth.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.640
Then I saw
a specialist.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.480
He knows nothing
about hands.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.480
So you came here.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.920
You're the best orthopod
in the country.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.520
From you,
that's sainthood.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.240
Besides, you were
the only guy at school

22:10.240 --> 22:14.240
who could tap a keg.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.440
Nasty scar,

22:19.440 --> 22:21.840
but there
appears to be

22:21.840 --> 22:23.760
a good
functional result.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.200
Everything works.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.320
Yeah.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.720
When I
use the hand,

22:28.720 --> 22:30.600
it causes
painful spasms

22:30.600 --> 22:32.560
down to
my fingertips.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.520
I've completely lost
fine control.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.440
There's always
the possibility

22:37.440 --> 22:41.440
of nerve damage
in the scar.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.120
Hmm.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.240
What do you think?

22:47.240 --> 22:49.840
I don't make
snap judgments.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.960
I get it.
You don't know.

22:52.960 --> 22:56.960
The same song I got
from everybody else.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.400
I'll consult
with Tom Smeeding.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.360
He's the hand man
at Hahnemann.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.840
Whatever's necessary.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.640
I'll take some pictures
and send them over.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.560
Cards on the table.

23:09.560 --> 23:12.440
Do you know
what it's like

23:12.440 --> 23:15.560
lying to everyone,
saying everything's fine?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.000
Mark, I can't promise.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.600
The others said
I'd never operate again.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.600
You must help me.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.520
Hi.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.360
Proud Eagle said
you were here.

23:43.360 --> 23:44.920
This damn disease.

23:44.920 --> 23:48.920
I can't even
blow my own nose.

23:49.520 --> 23:53.520
Here you go.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.360
I feel foolish.

23:56.360 --> 23:57.840
You're allowed.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.760
Oh, no, I'm not.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.200
I'm Father Joseph McCabe,
builder of dreams.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.320
Look at my picture,
smiling jackass.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.200
Always ready
with a funny line

24:09.200 --> 24:12.080
and a bit of
bloody advice.

24:12.080 --> 24:16.080
There's some spittle
on my chin.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.720
Thanks.

24:18.720 --> 24:22.720
I've been
waiting for us
to be alone.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.000
I need your advice.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.400
Last Thursday,
the board argued

24:31.400 --> 24:35.400
about continuing
a community service
program I started.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.200
I knew the chances
were bleak,

24:38.200 --> 24:42.080
but I figured passion
might sway the vote.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.800
There was an emergency
at my son's school.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.800
When I returned,
the whole board
was against me.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.440
I lost my temper
and the program.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.800
I'm taking care
of too many things.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.760
I'm not
solving anything.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.760
What's happened
to you, lad?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.920
I'm turning into
someone I don't like.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.800
You want
a solution from me?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.800
It would be nice.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.200
You still go
to church, Donald?

25:15.200 --> 25:18.400
Not in years.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
I can't perform
the mass anymore.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.320
I taste the body
of Christ,

25:24.320 --> 25:26.720
and I sip
his blood,

25:26.720 --> 25:30.080
and I don't
feel anything.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.000
I'm his
cursed servant.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
I have a cogent mind
and a wasted body.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.400
You have
some understanding

25:38.400 --> 25:41.040
of what's
happening to you.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.000
I have no
answers for you,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.560
no snippets
from the gospel.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.520
I need your help

25:48.520 --> 25:51.240
to get myself
back on track.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.680
You're so busy
creating problems,

25:53.680 --> 25:57.680
you never know
real problems
when you see it.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.440
What about you?

25:59.440 --> 26:01.640
Hiding behind
that collar,
pontificating,

26:01.640 --> 26:04.320
knowing what's best
for everybody.

26:04.320 --> 26:07.200
I'm a victim
of God's joke.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.080
He's taken away
my life's purpose.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.480
If your life's
a mess,

26:12.480 --> 26:15.320
you can do something
about that.

26:15.320 --> 26:19.320
You're right.
You're no help at all.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.160
This place makes me
want to sing and dance.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.960
Go ahead.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.400
I can't sing.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.880
You have
a lovely voice.

26:51.880 --> 26:55.720
I hear you
in the nursery
with Barbara.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.040
You know,
you've never
sung for me.

26:59.040 --> 27:03.040
Can you believe
that they moved
the Liberty Bell?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.640
They built a pavilion
especially for it.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.080
Why bother?

27:08.080 --> 27:10.480
It's no good.
It's cracked.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.400
Whenever
we come here,

27:12.400 --> 27:14.880
you say
the same thing.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.360
You always laugh.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.200
Once you return
to familiar
surroundings,

27:19.200 --> 27:22.600
you react the way
you used to.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.000
Independence Hall's
the only place

27:25.000 --> 27:27.400
I can use that joke.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.280
I was nervous
about coming here.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.360
Why?

27:31.360 --> 27:34.240
We spent
so much time here

27:34.240 --> 27:36.600
when we
were in college.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.960
I was afraid I
wouldn't measure up

27:39.960 --> 27:42.400
to the person I was.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.280
The most beautiful
girl at Penn.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.720
After
Candice Bergen.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.560
I don't know what
you saw in me.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.000
I was obnoxious.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.920
Underneath
that cocky veneer

27:53.920 --> 27:57.920
was a vulnerable boy
who needed me.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.080
What brought that on?

28:02.080 --> 28:06.080
Do I need a reason
to kiss my husband?

28:07.400 --> 28:10.320
There's something
I haven't told you.

28:10.320 --> 28:11.800
About your hand.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.840
Yes.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.200
It's worse
than you said.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.760
Sweeney should have
the results by now.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.640
May I come along?

28:20.640 --> 28:22.200
I'd like that.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.520
How did you know
about my hand?

28:25.520 --> 28:28.880
Why else
would we come
to Philadelphia

28:28.880 --> 28:30.320
in the summer?

28:30.320 --> 28:32.360
It's too warm.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.600
# It's hot as hell
in Philadelphia. #

28:34.600 --> 28:38.600
Don't ever say that I
never sang for you again.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.600
Do you know
what happened

28:49.600 --> 28:52.480
to the nurse's lounge
air conditioner?

28:52.480 --> 28:53.640
No.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.560
After you scrub
Colleen Clark's room,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.000
find a replacement.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.880
Nurse Rosenthal,
I can't.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.040
I think you can

29:02.040 --> 29:04.440
because if I
inform purchasing,

29:04.440 --> 29:07.400
an investigation
will ensue.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.880
The air will thicken
with intrigue.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.800
Orderlies
will be indicted.

29:12.800 --> 29:16.800
A/C will be
coming ASAP.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.200
I'm taking this
afternoon off.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.560
As long as someone's
covering for you.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.400
I know this is
kind of short notice,

29:26.400 --> 29:28.320
but...well,
you know.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.720
Are you busy
around 5:30?

29:30.720 --> 29:33.120
Yes. I have
a meeting

29:33.120 --> 29:36.000
unless
Dr Auschlander
flips the time.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.120
Why?
What's this about?

29:38.120 --> 29:40.000
Uh, well, um...

29:40.000 --> 29:42.960
never mind.
I'll find someone else.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.240
What's up?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.480
I'm going to City Hall.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.760
Wish me luck.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.040
Excuse me.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.280
Your daughter's
bringing Tommy here.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.720
What happened?

29:52.720 --> 29:55.120
Something about
a washing machine.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.560
Good luck, Jack.

29:56.560 --> 30:00.560
Thanks.

30:01.560 --> 30:05.560
You've entrapped
the sensory branch
of the radial nerve.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.800
I know. We had
anatomy together.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.520
When I use the hand,
the nerve's irritated.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.920
Can't we free
the nerve?

30:14.920 --> 30:16.320
There's one option.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.640
Destroy the nerve.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.000
You'll have
no sensation
in the area.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.440
Oh, great option.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.200
Maybe those idiots
at Boston General

30:25.200 --> 30:27.400
left something
in the wound.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.720
X-rays say no.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.960
Have you considered
peripheral neuropathy?

30:30.960 --> 30:33.680
You've had
trauma to the area.

30:33.680 --> 30:37.040
What you're
experiencing
is related to that.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.600
This may go away
on its own.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.520
When we were
in school together,

30:43.520 --> 30:46.720
you could practically
turn water into wine.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.720
So don't say
you can't do anything.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.400
I'm sorry.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.800
Well, that's great!

30:53.800 --> 30:57.800
That makes everything
just peachy-keen.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.840
Mark, what happened?

31:00.840 --> 31:03.600
Sweeney's not that
good, after all.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.000
I'm through.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.280
We'll do something.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.600
We'll do nothing!

31:07.600 --> 31:09.320
We're in this
together.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.320
Just leave me alone!

31:13.640 --> 31:17.640
Next time, wear
the motorcycle helmet.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.680
I'm honored,
and I'm thrilled.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.880
You're not
my first choice.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.240
Don't take
the rose's
last bloom, Jack.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.000
You don't take
the last pickle.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.880
Meet me at 5:30.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.800
You're covering for me.

31:32.800 --> 31:35.240
Why should I?
Forget it.

31:35.240 --> 31:38.400
Jenkins was DOA,
Jack, DOA.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.800
That's blackmail.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.560
You said it.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.400
What's happening
at 5:30?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.840
He's getting
married.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.400
Come on.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.200
I'm getting a car.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.480
Really? What make?

31:49.480 --> 31:52.400
"Dr Morrison,
call the page operator."

31:52.400 --> 31:54.280
Take over for me.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.480
You should've
come to me.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.400
My cousin has
a Datsun dealership.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.200
Next time,
you wear the helmet.

32:02.200 --> 32:06.200
Ooh!

32:07.360 --> 32:09.240
Can you do this?

32:09.240 --> 32:10.400
OK?

32:10.400 --> 32:12.160
Come on. Let's try.

32:12.160 --> 32:16.160
Here we go.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.120
Come on.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.560
Look. Once more.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.600
OK?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.040
Here we go.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.520
Come on.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.280
Catch it.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.720
Ah. A solarium.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.640
What
a wonderful thing

32:34.640 --> 32:37.840
to do to the polio
isolation ward.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.760
This is your son.

32:39.760 --> 32:40.800
Tommy.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.840
Named after
your father.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.040
Thanks for
coming up.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.480
What's his problem?

32:46.480 --> 32:47.760
He's autistic.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.200
We manage.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.640
Otherwise,
he's healthy?

32:50.640 --> 32:53.200
Yeah. Almost perfect.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.600
Listen, Donnie,
about last night--

32:55.600 --> 32:57.440
No. I apologize, too.

32:57.440 --> 33:01.400
Stop it. Slow down.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.240
Kid's got
a good arm, eh?

33:04.240 --> 33:07.280
Now, Tommy.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.040
I'm sorry,
Proud Eagle.

33:09.040 --> 33:11.520
Tommy, stop it.
Stop it.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.680
Tommy.

33:12.680 --> 33:16.680
Tommy, lad.

33:17.520 --> 33:21.520
Let him go.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.880
Come to me, lad.

34:00.520 --> 34:04.520
God love you.

34:35.719 --> 34:37.960
Shoe's on
the other foot.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.400
You get it?

34:39.400 --> 34:41.320
First time we met,

34:41.320 --> 34:45.320
I was sitting
in that very place.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.840
I'll tell you this.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.239
The view
sure has changed.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.639
That ugly library
wasn't there.

34:52.639 --> 34:56.639
Maybe it was
a Horn and Hardart.

34:58.720 --> 35:02.720
These kids are too young
to be in college.

35:07.680 --> 35:11.680
I talked
to Dr Sweeney.

35:15.360 --> 35:19.360
The first thing
I remember about
you was your shoes.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.360
Two-toned,
wing-tip, shiny.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.760
You asked me
if I was injured,

35:24.760 --> 35:28.640
and you said you
would be a doctor.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.880
And I thought,

35:29.880 --> 35:33.880
"well, not very original,
but sincere."

35:34.240 --> 35:38.040
Maybe if I'd never
come to this school,

35:38.040 --> 35:42.040
if I hadn't
been so...

35:42.080 --> 35:44.000
consumed with
the future,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.400
trying to achieve
some perfection

35:46.400 --> 35:50.400
you can't even get
your hands on...

35:51.440 --> 35:55.440
maybe this wouldn't
have happened.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.800
Now listen, Mark.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.640
Whenever you've been
faced with defeat--

36:02.640 --> 36:04.600
fumbling your
first surgery

36:04.600 --> 36:07.440
or losing your heart
transplant patient,

36:07.440 --> 36:10.320
even the horror
of Stephen's death--

36:10.320 --> 36:12.720
you've risen
above the pain.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.040
You've gotten stronger.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.240
This isn't the end
of the world.

36:17.240 --> 36:21.240
It's just another
obstacle to overcome.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.480
35 years ago,

36:22.480 --> 36:26.480
I fell in love with you
on this very spot.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.640
Are you sorry
you did?

36:29.640 --> 36:33.640
Oh, for crying out loud.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.360
Relief is
on the way.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.640
Jack, slow down.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.360
One knee injury's
enough.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.640
I'll be late.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.280
Richard Jenkins
in 3162 wants you.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.240
He's not my patient.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.760
Yes, he is.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.440
The guy
from the morgue.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.240
I got to go.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.680
So go. 3162.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.200
I've been on hold
for 10 minutes.

37:13.200 --> 37:17.200
Wasn't I covering
for you?

37:18.760 --> 37:21.160
I'm fit to be tied.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.440
What's the matter?

37:22.440 --> 37:24.200
My air
conditioner's gone.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.400
Maybe someone thought
you were leaving early

37:27.400 --> 37:31.400
to take a dip
with Mrs Auschlander.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.640
I enjoy lapping
with Katharine.

37:33.640 --> 37:37.320
Anyway, that someone
will find a replacement.

37:37.320 --> 37:41.320
Just put an end
to this roundelay.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.600
So you're the one.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.000
When you
picked me up,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.120
I thought you
were Jesus.

37:53.120 --> 37:55.000
Well,
don't thank me.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.840
I'm not.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.240
The overdose
was no mistake.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.400
Huh?

38:00.400 --> 38:03.760
When I get well,
I'll try again.

38:03.760 --> 38:07.600
Not around here
because we'll
save you again.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.000
Don't threaten me.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.920
We've all had times

38:11.920 --> 38:13.680
when everything
went wrong

38:13.680 --> 38:17.280
and looked for ways
to stop the pain.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.800
Drugs, suicide...

38:19.800 --> 38:23.480
just when you think
there are no answers,

38:23.480 --> 38:24.920
something comes along.

38:24.920 --> 38:28.920
The world's full
of possibilities.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
I got to go.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.440
You're back so soon

38:42.440 --> 38:45.320
from the city
of brotherly love.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.800
It rained constantly.

38:46.800 --> 38:50.600
They should hand out
umbrellas at the border.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.480
Reliving your youth
must be invigorating.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.400
Ellen couldn't
get enough.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
Really?

38:56.400 --> 38:57.800
Of the town!

38:57.800 --> 39:00.800
Your mind is
in the gutter.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.120
How's your hand?

39:02.120 --> 39:04.520
Sweeney said
with intensive therapy

39:04.520 --> 39:06.440
and a little luck,

39:06.440 --> 39:09.800
I'll be back soon.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.200
I'm no quitter.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.160
Never suggested you were.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.040
How is Mr Lukas?

39:15.040 --> 39:17.440
He didn't respond
to antibiotics.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.840
He'll need
a lung biopsy.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.240
I'll give him a look.

39:22.240 --> 39:26.240
Father McCabe's dedicating
the new scanner.

39:37.160 --> 39:41.160
For crying out loud.

40:07.360 --> 40:08.800
Sorry I'm late.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.200
You're not alone.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.640
Who's sorry?

40:11.640 --> 40:13.120
Who's late?

40:13.120 --> 40:16.440
One prisoner waited
five years for trial,

40:16.440 --> 40:18.360
forgotten
by the system.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.800
Where, in Istanbul?

40:19.800 --> 40:21.200
No, in Houston.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.120
Here.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.960
Sorry. I got lost
somewhere on the subway.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.400
Wayne, it's Joanne.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.320
Nice to meet you.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.720
Thanks for
helping us out.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.120
Now I'll
help you in.

40:36.120 --> 40:40.120
Right this way.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.920
Who is
John Morrison?

40:45.920 --> 40:47.320
He is.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.040
You're
Joanne McFadden?

40:49.040 --> 40:50.000
Yes.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.120
She is.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.440
And you're?

40:52.440 --> 40:55.200
Wayne Fiscus, best man
once removed.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.520
These are
the life sentences

40:57.520 --> 41:01.520
I like to give out.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.800
You stand here.
John, over here.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.800
Mr Fiscus,
right here.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.240
Dr Fiscus.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.360
Frightening.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.800
Now let's begin.

41:10.800 --> 41:14.800
Would it be OK
if I hold her hand?

41:15.680 --> 41:18.800
We'd all prefer that.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.760
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

41:21.760 --> 41:24.040
to join
John Steinbeck Morrison

41:24.040 --> 41:25.960
and Joanne McFadden
in matrimony.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.400
How are you?

41:27.400 --> 41:28.840
Happy. I'm happy.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.720
Families are
the foundation of fellowship,

41:31.720 --> 41:35.720
therefore matrimony is
to be entered into reverently.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.920
Donald.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.920
Hello, Father.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.600
I made
an important decision.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.600
I'm not going out
to pasture.

41:50.920 --> 41:53.320
You're returning
to the reservation?

41:53.320 --> 41:56.640
Yes. I came to Boston
to die.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.520
I was wrong.
I've been reborn.

41:59.520 --> 42:03.520
Come on.
I'll walk you down.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.640
Father, care
for a truffle?

42:24.640 --> 42:26.080
No, thank you.

42:26.080 --> 42:30.080
Bittersweet's a terrible
waste of a cocoa bean.

42:30.840 --> 42:34.840
What a lovely woman.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.800
40 years ago,
you let me beat you up.

42:44.160 --> 42:48.000
I've waited for you
to start swinging back.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.840
What you said
last night, Father...

42:50.840 --> 42:53.240
all the pieces
for happiness

42:53.240 --> 42:56.600
being laid out
in front of me.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.000
Well, Donnie,
it's your life.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.400
Only you can put
the puzzle together.

43:02.400 --> 43:06.200
Yeah, well,
I'm starting.

43:06.200 --> 43:10.000
Seems to me you're
spending too much time

43:10.000 --> 43:11.440
behind that desk.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.400
You're a wonderful
doctor.

43:13.400 --> 43:17.400
Be one. Take care
of that family of yours.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.720
I will.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.840
Despite my reputation,
this speech will be short.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.320
Well, fairly short.

43:27.320 --> 43:30.640
This room has always
handled head trauma.

43:30.640 --> 43:34.520
In my day, that meant
a white table,

43:34.520 --> 43:37.600
a basin,
and a damp cloth.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.680
Today...

43:38.680 --> 43:42.560
they tell me that
this machine gives us

43:42.560 --> 43:46.320
a three-dimensional
cross section of the brain.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.520
Miraculous.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.800
However,
the basis of medicine

43:49.800 --> 43:51.760
isn't a computer
print-out,

43:51.760 --> 43:54.600
but the mind
that created it.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.080
The rational mind

43:56.080 --> 43:59.920
that knows what to do
with the information.

43:59.920 --> 44:02.320
The compassionate mind
that teaches

44:02.320 --> 44:06.000
and consoles and loves.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
I tell you that because
I almost forgot it.

44:11.240 --> 44:15.080
Losing the use
of my body's been a...

44:15.080 --> 44:16.520
terrible ordeal.

44:16.520 --> 44:20.360
But if I had to choose
between that

44:20.360 --> 44:23.240
and the loss of my mind...

44:23.240 --> 44:26.120
well, there's
so much to do.

44:26.120 --> 44:30.120
All of us touch
so many in our work.

44:30.440 --> 44:34.440
There's no better reason
for being alive.

44:34.680 --> 44:37.320
Over here, Joseph.

44:37.320 --> 46:05.000
Proud Eagle,
if you please.
