WEBVTT

00:00.075 --> 00:01.654
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.713 --> 00:04.352
Her name's Sophia. That's my half sister.

00:04.948 --> 00:05.927
Can we hang out again?

00:05.935 --> 00:07.363
You told Emma about Hayley?
- Yes,

00:07.364 --> 00:09.475
why would you tell Hayley
you're a couple, and not Emma?

00:09.553 --> 00:10.627
That's none of your business.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.713
This is about you trying to
be like all those other girls.

00:12.726 --> 00:14.660
- Are you OK?
- Not really, no.

00:14.693 --> 00:17.262
I ate a pot brownie, and I'm freaking out.

00:17.297 --> 00:18.564
It's OK. You made a mistake.

00:18.598 --> 00:20.666
- I slept with Dani.
- Dani?

00:20.700 --> 00:23.268
I haven't told you. I was raped.

00:23.303 --> 00:25.270
I thought I put it behind me,

00:25.305 --> 00:29.108
but it turns out I still have some stuff

00:29.142 --> 00:30.376
I have to work through.

00:30.410 --> 00:32.043
Take as long as you need.

00:32.078 --> 00:33.245
Is Lena gonna be OK?

00:33.279 --> 00:35.347
Yeah, now, but she lost the baby.

00:35.382 --> 00:40.953
Sometimes I'm afraid that
they're not gonna love me

00:40.987 --> 00:42.121
as much as I love them.

00:42.155 --> 00:44.223
Biology or not,

00:44.257 --> 00:46.925
everybody's afraid that our children

00:46.960 --> 00:48.861
won't love us the way we love them.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.920
What's taking so freaking
long? Did you fall in?

00:54.955 --> 00:59.625
- I'm about to leak.
- Go downstairs.

00:59.659 --> 01:02.394
Jude's in the bathroom don't
want me to come with you?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.430
'Cause I, I don't mind.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.664
No, I know.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.232
I think it's better if
it's just me and Jude.

01:07.267 --> 01:08.634
I want him to get to know Sophia,

01:08.668 --> 01:12.404
so he doesn't feel so,
you know, threatened.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.340
And I don't think he's gonna
do that if you're there.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.375
OK.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.478
And have you decided about
what you're gonna tell Robert

01:19.512 --> 01:22.181
- about the college fund?
- I'm going to say thanks,

01:22.215 --> 01:24.316
but I don't want anything from you,

01:24.351 --> 01:26.051
and that includes your money.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.889
- You do know how to swim, yes?
- Yes.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.759
Mom, Mariana's way past her time.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.994
Well, you're old enough to work it out.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.829
I'm not getting involved.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.099
Let's go, your 15 minutes
was up like 15 minutes ago.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.635
What the... ?

01:43.670 --> 01:44.837
Fine, I'll finish in my bedroom.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.772
Don't say I never did anything for you.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.809
Thank you, you're a real saint.

01:50.844 --> 01:55.647
Ooh, quite the fashion statement, Judicorn.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.715
Have you seen my other flip-flop?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.484
Nope, sorry.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.020
Uh, no flip-flops, Jude.

02:00.054 --> 02:01.988
- Sneakers?
- Sneakers.

02:02.023 --> 02:03.990
All right, everybody,
taxi leaves in two minutes.

02:04.025 --> 02:05.058
Let's hop to it.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.827
Jesus, Mariana, Callie, Jude. Let's go!

02:07.862 --> 02:09.795
- I just need to get my...
- Gym bag?

02:09.830 --> 02:11.164
Took the liberty of
washing your wrestling gear.

02:11.198 --> 02:14.034
Lesson learned: You can't just
let that stuff rot in there.

02:14.068 --> 02:15.068
Yeah, OK.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.971
Yo! Go! Now! Come on,
one, two, three, four!

02:18.005 --> 02:20.907
All right, I'll see you
later. Where's, um, Brandon?

02:20.942 --> 02:21.975
What's he up to?

02:22.009 --> 02:23.577
Oh, I think he's still
sleeping. I'll check on him.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.711
OK, maybe give him a little incentive

02:24.745 --> 02:26.580
to get out of the house?

02:26.614 --> 02:27.547
You and I could use a
quiet afternoon at home,

02:27.582 --> 02:28.648
just the two of us.

02:28.683 --> 02:29.649
OK?

02:29.684 --> 02:30.884
- Thank you, I love you.
- Love you.

02:36.591 --> 02:37.557
Good morning.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.660
Hey, morning.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.229
How you feeling?

02:43.264 --> 02:46.499
Oh, as good as could be expected, I guess.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.168
You?

02:49.236 --> 02:51.104
So you got any plans for the day?

02:51.138 --> 02:54.507
Um, no, probably just
gonna work on some music.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.343
That's about it.

02:59.213 --> 03:02.148
Well, the kids are all out of the house.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.984
So I think it's time.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.087
We need to tell.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.104
Good shove.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.811
Good defense! Wedge her! Wedge her!

04:04.845 --> 04:06.780
Watch it! Watch it!

04:08.015 --> 04:09.916
Break!

04:14.088 --> 04:17.656
Match to Jesus. Hey, great footwork.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.661
And Emma, nice escape, but
you lost focus. It cost you.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.563
Right, got it.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.698
All right, let's clear the mats.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.599
And the ladder, I'll see you all tonight.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.567
All right?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.668
Nice match.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.739
That's it?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.408
What? What do you want, Jesus?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.711
I don't know. I just...
I just want us to be cool.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.547
I am such an idiot.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.715
I was stupid enough to think

04:41.749 --> 04:44.317
the first words out of your
mouth would be "I'm sorry."

04:44.351 --> 04:45.652
I am sorry.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.687
I should have never let
Mariana open her big mouth

04:47.755 --> 04:49.389
about me and Hayley.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.157
But don't forget, you broke up with me.

04:51.192 --> 04:53.526
And you waited like five
seconds to replace me.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.328
Makes me feel like a real winner, Foster.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.464
How was I supposed to know you
wanted to get back together?

05:00.301 --> 05:02.435
I'm not doing this anymore.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.938
Everything's cool, OK?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.372
We never should've
dated in the first place,

05:06.407 --> 05:10.276
I mean, if Hayley's what you want, well,

05:10.311 --> 05:12.278
I think we both know
she's everything I'm not,

05:12.313 --> 05:14.781
and nothing that I want to be.

05:17.952 --> 05:20.120
But I do think it's time
that you find a new tutor.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.313
Hey! You're here early.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.597
What was that all about?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.632
Some team stuff.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.601
Hmm.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.515
You OK?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.291
We are so happy you guys could make it.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.459
Soph's been talking about it for days.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.328
- Dad, shut up.
- Sophia.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.719
Sorry.

06:04.723 --> 06:08.998
I'm just... so excited
to finally meet you, Jude.

06:09.589 --> 06:12.017
And for you to finally meet our dad.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.440
I mean...

06:14.475 --> 06:16.342
Yeah, Jude and I already have a dad.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.244
His name's Donald.

06:18.279 --> 06:20.046
Right. Yeah, I know.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.948
Sophia, why don't you
come help me put out lunch?

06:29.957 --> 06:33.960
You guys really do look
alike, even more in person.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.863
You think?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.631
I guess, a little.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.835
So which side is port?

06:41.869 --> 06:44.737
Uh... this one.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.874
Why don't you just say "left?"

06:47.908 --> 06:49.742
Well, you don't want there
to the opposite direction,

06:49.777 --> 06:51.744
or if something goes wrong.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.812
Come on.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.587
Lena, I'm home!

07:00.621 --> 07:02.488
I'm in the living room.

07:11.332 --> 07:13.399
- Hi.
- Hey, honey.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.535
What's going on?

07:18.239 --> 07:19.472
You expecting someone?

07:23.377 --> 07:26.946
- Hey.
- Hi, what's up?

07:26.981 --> 07:29.949
Lena called, said you wanted to talk?

07:32.353 --> 07:34.020
I do?

07:36.090 --> 07:37.257
What's going on, love?

07:40.027 --> 07:42.061
Is this about the surgery?
You changed your mind?

07:42.096 --> 07:49.102
No, this isn't about his hand.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.970
Uh, Brandon has something
something important,

07:51.005 --> 07:55.642
and I'd like everyone to promise
that no one leaves this house

07:55.676 --> 07:58.511
until we all agree how
to handle this together,

08:03.417 --> 08:04.417
OK.

08:06.754 --> 08:10.423
OK, so... what's with the buildup?

08:10.457 --> 08:11.591
What are we talking about?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.394
It's about Dani.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.330
I knew it.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.432
I knew you had a problem with her, Brandon.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.167
No, no, it's...

08:25.439 --> 08:26.539
B?

08:26.573 --> 08:31.311
This is hard for him to
say, just give him a minute.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.948
Brandon, please, tell me that
this isn't what I'm thinking.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.383
What are you thinking?

08:37.418 --> 08:39.118
Brandon, what happened?

08:41.322 --> 08:45.158
- Did Dani do something?
- Excuse me?

08:45.192 --> 08:48.161
Brandon was in a vulnerable position...

08:48.195 --> 08:49.829
No, no, no.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.900
I want to hear it from him.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.840
Um...

09:00.874 --> 09:06.579
the night you kicked Dani out of the house,

09:06.613 --> 09:09.382
she came back to get her stuff,

09:09.416 --> 09:11.584
and I...

09:13.721 --> 09:16.422
... I had a few beers.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.628
And my audition for
symphony was the next day,

09:22.663 --> 09:25.431
so she, uh...

09:25.466 --> 09:29.369
told me to go to bed, sleep it off,

09:29.403 --> 09:33.239
so she helped me undress...

09:35.175 --> 09:37.443
... and...

09:37.478 --> 09:39.278
... and it just sort of happened.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.885
What happened?

09:51.025 --> 09:53.092
We had sex.

10:01.382 --> 10:03.140
What the hell do you mean, you had sex?

10:03.145 --> 10:04.953
Obviously he was seduced.

10:04.987 --> 10:07.956
No, I was... I was drunk,
and I wasn't thinking.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.558
It's my fault.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.526
Drunk? You were drunk? Did
Dani give you the booze?

10:11.561 --> 10:13.595
No, no, I was upset and...

10:13.629 --> 10:15.697
Oh, my God, I can't believe you
did not break up with that woman

10:15.731 --> 10:17.465
when you had the chance.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.833
You knew that she could not be trusted,

10:18.868 --> 10:20.835
- but you are so pathetic!
- So this is my fault?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.505
I didn't say that it was your
fault, but I'm just saying...

10:23.539 --> 10:24.539
That was exactly what you said.

10:24.574 --> 10:25.574
You said that I didn't break up with her.

10:25.608 --> 10:27.275
I can't believe that
I let you have custody.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.276
Oh, Brandon's been so
perfect under your rule.

10:28.311 --> 10:30.245
Stop it!

10:30.279 --> 10:35.150
God, I never should have told you.

10:35.184 --> 10:36.217
- Brandon!
- Brandon!

10:36.252 --> 10:38.253
- Brandon! I'm so...
- Let him go.

10:40.256 --> 10:44.092
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

10:44.126 --> 10:46.227
Stef, why are you acting
like this is Mike's fault?

10:46.262 --> 10:48.096
And Mike, I know that you are hurt

10:48.130 --> 10:49.864
and this is confusing as hell,

10:49.899 --> 10:51.967
but can't you see what
this is doing to your son?

10:59.942 --> 11:01.776
Hey, I'm taking off.

11:01.811 --> 11:02.978
Am I seeing you tonight?

11:03.012 --> 11:04.813
Oh, no, remember?

11:04.847 --> 11:06.114
I have that dinner at Coach's house.

11:06.148 --> 11:08.583
- Dinner?
- I told you.

11:08.618 --> 11:10.785
The one where he gives out
all the goofy awards and stuff?

11:10.820 --> 11:13.588
And somebody is getting
"Most Improved," right?

11:13.623 --> 11:15.624
That's the rumor.

11:15.658 --> 11:17.926
Is Emma gonna be there?

11:17.960 --> 11:20.862
This is a team dinner,
and she's on the team.

11:20.896 --> 11:22.397
OK, let's go!

11:22.431 --> 11:23.798
- Call me later?
- Promise.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.704
We don't have time to mess around today.

11:29.739 --> 11:32.273
Competition season starts this month,

11:32.308 --> 11:34.576
and we are not losing this year.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.612
We need to talk dollars.

11:37.647 --> 11:39.547
Our first competition is in L.A.,

11:39.582 --> 11:42.584
and the truth is, we don't have
enough money for everyone to go.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.185
We don't?

11:44.220 --> 11:46.988
At least one of us, and
maybe even two, can't go.

11:47.023 --> 11:49.357
Well, what if we have like
a car wash or something?

11:49.392 --> 11:51.292
We're not allowed, remember?

11:51.327 --> 11:54.963
Clubs and teams can't do
any "extra" fundraising.

11:54.997 --> 11:57.966
So, if you're planning
on holding anything back

11:58.000 --> 12:00.101
in rehearsal today... don't.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.903
All right, let's get started.

12:01.937 --> 12:03.071
Hayley, you lead the warm-up.

12:09.779 --> 12:12.981
Callie, you wanna try?

12:13.015 --> 12:14.983
- No?
- Mm-mm, no.

12:15.017 --> 12:16.785
Jude, how about you?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.620
Come one! Get in here!

12:18.654 --> 12:19.988
What are you gonna hit, an iceberg?

12:20.022 --> 12:21.690
Get up there.

12:21.724 --> 12:23.825
There you go.

12:23.859 --> 12:26.861
Feels good, right? Steering the ship?

12:26.896 --> 12:29.564
Oh, look out!  I'm kidding.

12:29.598 --> 12:31.666
I was kidding. I was kidding, relax.

12:33.703 --> 12:35.537
How do you know where you're going?

12:35.571 --> 12:37.372
Oh, I have this GPS right here.

12:37.406 --> 12:38.540
Have you ever gotten lost?

12:38.574 --> 12:40.742
Ah, once, yeah, when I was sailing.

12:40.776 --> 12:42.277
Really?

12:42.311 --> 12:46.581
Yeah, I got lost in
some really rough water,

12:46.615 --> 12:50.118
but actually between us,
it was pretty awesome.

12:50.152 --> 12:52.320
Sounds pretty terrible.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.022
No, no, it was an adventure.

12:54.056 --> 12:56.291
I mean, was I scared? Yeah, I was.

12:56.325 --> 12:58.193
But, you know, sometimes
you just have to let go,

12:58.227 --> 13:00.962
give up control, turn it over to the stars.

13:00.996 --> 13:02.197
You know?

13:06.869 --> 13:10.071
Hey, Jude...

13:10.106 --> 13:13.007
Listen, I know learning
that Callie had this

13:13.042 --> 13:17.712
whole "other family" has been crazy,

13:17.747 --> 13:20.648
but I don't want you to be scared.

13:20.683 --> 13:22.851
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I wanna get to know Callie.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.920
And you, too, if you're open to it.

13:25.955 --> 13:29.758
But I'm never gonna try
and replace your father.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.460
And no matter what, you
and Callie still share that,

13:32.495 --> 13:34.829
OK? And you always will.

13:50.212 --> 13:51.446
Hey, back row?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.314
Try and land that floor work clean, please?

13:53.349 --> 13:55.116
You look like you're having a seizure.

13:55.151 --> 13:57.418
Ignore her, she's just stressed.

13:57.453 --> 14:00.054
OK, let's take it from the
top of the second section.

14:05.127 --> 14:08.062
Five, six, seven, eight.

15:10.092 --> 15:12.293
Mariana, can you come here, please?

15:12.328 --> 15:15.263
Tia, can you show her how
to do the floor work, please?

15:26.351 --> 15:27.061
That is how you do it.

15:27.762 --> 15:28.983
If you can't lay it like that,

15:28.991 --> 15:30.879
then you're not going to competition.

15:30.913 --> 15:34.883
OK, take five. And
"five" means five, people.

15:34.917 --> 15:39.020
Hey, look, it just takes
time. OK, you'll get it.

15:39.054 --> 15:42.056
I don't want to get cut from the team.

15:42.091 --> 15:45.727
Well, I mean, I happy to...
you know, work on it with you.

15:45.761 --> 15:46.861
If you want.

15:48.664 --> 15:49.697
Yeah?

15:49.732 --> 15:50.899
OK, so it's...

15:50.933 --> 15:54.535
it's just drag, hands,
sweep it to the floor.

15:54.570 --> 15:59.774
OK, but you gotta trust. OK, try it.

15:59.808 --> 16:02.443
No, see, you gotta go for it.

16:02.478 --> 16:03.544
OK, you're holding yourself back.

16:03.579 --> 16:05.380
I don't know. I guess...

16:05.414 --> 16:08.616
... all the contemporary and the
hip-hop we've been doing lately

16:08.651 --> 16:10.418
doesn't come as natural to me.

16:10.452 --> 16:14.188
- Excuse me?
- You know what I mean.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.258
Uh, no, I'm afraid I don't.
Do you care to explain?

16:19.128 --> 16:20.528
Well, I mean, you're just so good,

16:20.562 --> 16:22.397
you make the rest of us look bad.

16:22.431 --> 16:24.499
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.001
Well, I mean, you could try to blend in.

16:27.036 --> 16:28.436
This is a dance team, you know?

16:28.470 --> 16:30.371
What? Should I dye my hair?

16:32.041 --> 16:33.174
You know what?

16:33.208 --> 16:36.044
Um, why don't you just
work it out on your own.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.145
Good luck.

16:42.217 --> 16:44.752
B?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.164
I'm glad you told us.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.801
I'm not.

16:59.835 --> 17:02.670
You understand that Dani was
the adult in this situation.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.477
- And that you're a minor.
- Yes.

17:09.511 --> 17:11.713
And that means that what
happened was illegal.

17:11.747 --> 17:14.348
- Mom...
- You're the victim here.

17:14.383 --> 17:15.583
I'm not a victim.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.519
Honey, I handle a lot of these cases,

17:18.554 --> 17:22.589
and it is common that the boys
don't think they've been raped.

17:22.624 --> 17:26.493
The difference is that
I'm not one of your cases.

17:28.163 --> 17:30.365
I was there. I know what I did.

17:30.399 --> 17:33.134
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd stop telling me

17:33.168 --> 17:34.302
how I should feel about it.

17:37.339 --> 17:41.909
I get that you might not
see it this way now...

17:41.944 --> 17:46.147
... but Dani broke the law
and she needs to be prosecuted.

17:49.118 --> 17:52.020
Well, I'm not gonna cooperate.

17:52.054 --> 17:56.657
I'll say you're lying or that I made it up.

17:56.692 --> 18:00.595
This is... completely humiliating.

18:01.897 --> 18:05.967
I'm not telling the police,
and you can't make me.

18:15.018 --> 18:17.419
- I love your jeans.
- Oh, thanks.

18:17.453 --> 18:19.154
I wanna get some like those, Mom.

18:19.188 --> 18:21.223
OK, we'll see what we can find.

18:25.431 --> 18:28.060
So, tell me about your school. It's
so cool you guys are by the beach.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.236
Archfield's so... uptight.

18:31.271 --> 18:33.138
Uptight? What does that mean?

18:33.172 --> 18:37.242
You know, the uniforms
and rules and everything.

18:37.277 --> 18:39.778
It's a lot.

18:39.812 --> 18:41.179
Well, yeah, even though it's on the beach,

18:41.214 --> 18:43.715
it's not really a day at one.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.816
It's actually pretty tough,

18:44.851 --> 18:46.051
definitely the hardest
school I've ever been to.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.853
I've been to a lot, you know?

18:47.887 --> 18:49.688
How many?

18:49.722 --> 18:53.525
Um, seven, I guess, all together.

18:53.559 --> 18:56.862
Wow, I feel like such a nerd right now.

18:56.966 --> 18:59.835
I've only been to one
school my entire life.

18:59.869 --> 19:03.505
- But you love Archfield.
- Not really.

19:03.539 --> 19:06.575
- Since when?
- Since forever.

19:06.609 --> 19:09.461
Well, I think Archfield sounds really cool.

19:09.612 --> 19:11.713
Why?

19:11.748 --> 19:14.683
I don't know. You were talking about

19:14.717 --> 19:16.518
the trips you guys go on every year?

19:16.552 --> 19:18.720
- Where'd you go last fall?
- Barcelona?

19:18.755 --> 19:22.424
Right, Barcelona. We're not
doing that at Anchor Beach.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.626
Well, all we did was walk around the street

19:24.660 --> 19:26.495
and go to museums and stuff.

19:26.529 --> 19:29.164
What about all those
beautiful photographs you took?

19:29.198 --> 19:31.199
You take pictures?

19:31.234 --> 19:32.467
Me, too.

19:35.505 --> 19:38.173
Still, I think you're really lucky.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.042
I'd love to go to Spain.

19:41.077 --> 19:45.046
It seems so cool and artsy and romantic.

19:45.081 --> 19:48.250
It might be. There weren't any boys.

19:48.284 --> 19:50.051
Archfield's all girls.

19:50.086 --> 19:53.855
And we're a little
young for romance anyway.

19:55.291 --> 19:56.858
You know, Callie has a boyfriend.

19:57.994 --> 19:59.027
Really?

19:59.061 --> 20:01.930
His name's Wyatt. He's super hot.

20:01.964 --> 20:05.967
Um, yeah, we're just taking
a little break right now.

20:07.203 --> 20:09.971
How come?

20:10.006 --> 20:12.073
Callie, you gotta come see the engine room.

20:12.108 --> 20:14.876
It's crazy. It's like something
out of The Golden Compass.

20:14.911 --> 20:17.646
Cool. Excuse me.

20:24.954 --> 20:28.523
I understand you're
trying to impress Callie,

20:28.558 --> 20:30.625
but being rude to your mother
is not the way to do it.

20:40.303 --> 20:41.436
B never liked Dani.

20:41.471 --> 20:45.307
Maybe... maybe he's
trying to get rid of her.

20:45.341 --> 20:46.575
You know? I mean, he could be lying.

20:46.609 --> 20:48.543
He's not lying, Mike.

20:53.316 --> 20:55.150
Where are you going? Mike?

20:55.184 --> 20:57.085
I just want to talk to her.

20:57.119 --> 20:59.187
I just wanna find out what
she has to say for herself.

20:59.222 --> 21:01.256
Mike, you promised that you would stay here

21:01.290 --> 21:03.091
and figure this out with us together.

21:03.125 --> 21:07.162
So Brandon won't... he doesn't
want us to press charges.

21:07.196 --> 21:09.130
Well, that's not really surprising, is it?

21:09.165 --> 21:11.299
Wait, wait, wait. Press charges for what?

21:11.334 --> 21:13.068
For statutory rape.

21:14.987 --> 21:16.855
You think Brandon was raped?

21:18.025 --> 21:19.995
You think Dani raped Brandon?

21:19.996 --> 21:22.956
Mike, you... you know the definition...

21:22.962 --> 21:25.931
- of statutory rape.
- Come on, Stef! He knew what he was doing.

21:25.965 --> 21:28.867
- So, he's not an adult.
- He's 16!

21:28.901 --> 21:30.869
Trust me, Dani didn't force him.

21:30.903 --> 21:33.738
I know how a 16-year-old boy thinks.

21:33.773 --> 21:37.173
- That is not the issue here.
- I can't... I can't...

21:37.176 --> 21:39.050
Mike. Mike! You promised.

21:39.060 --> 21:42.068
I need a minute. I'll be out back.

21:49.180 --> 21:51.741
So was your mom bummed when she
was passed over for principal?

21:52.900 --> 21:55.009
No, um, it was for the best.

21:55.041 --> 21:56.682
I mean, she already has a lot on her plate.

21:56.716 --> 22:00.386
Um, wait, Lena's your mom?

22:00.420 --> 22:04.390
- Lena the vice-principal?
- Yeah, I'm adopted.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.593
Oh, um, nice.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.629
You're lucky. I wish I was adopted.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.432
But what about your real parents?

22:13.467 --> 22:16.469
I mean, do you know anything about them?

22:16.503 --> 22:19.405
Stef and Lena are my real parents.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.440
Right. Sorry, but you know what I mean.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.244
No, it was a closed adoption.

22:25.278 --> 22:27.213
I don't know anything about them.

22:27.247 --> 22:29.448
That would drive me crazy
wondering who they are.

22:29.483 --> 22:31.217
Yeah, don't you want to find them?

22:31.251 --> 22:34.920
You know, at least to
see if you look like them?

22:34.955 --> 22:39.258
Um, you know what I was thinking about?

22:39.292 --> 22:41.126
How we don't have any
money for the competition.

22:41.161 --> 22:44.129
Let me talk to my mom
and see what I can do.

22:44.164 --> 22:46.665
I mean, the new principal
hasn't started yet,

22:46.700 --> 22:48.067
she's still in charge, right?

22:55.041 --> 22:57.842
I think... I think I'm gonna stay here.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.578
Are you sure?

22:59.613 --> 23:00.880
Yeah, I feel a little seasick.

23:00.914 --> 23:02.781
You guys go ahead.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.417
We're just going to the
ship's store across the marina.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.652
I'll keep him occupied.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.588
Yeah, great. Come on, let's go.

23:10.561 --> 23:12.419
Well, we won't be long, I promise.

23:15.380 --> 23:16.850
All right. Callie, you wanna drive?

23:17.531 --> 23:20.499
- Yeah!
- All right.

23:20.534 --> 23:23.269
Turn the key.

23:23.303 --> 23:24.503
- All right?
- Yeah, go back.

23:24.538 --> 23:28.307
Oops! A little bit. Just a little bit.

23:28.341 --> 23:29.575
- Perfect.
- OK.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.176
Nice.

23:31.211 --> 23:32.278
I'm in neutral, right?

23:32.312 --> 23:34.113
Yeah, now turn it around
to the right a little bit.

23:34.147 --> 23:35.381
There you go. OK, that's cool.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.150
- And forward?
- Yeah.

23:48.128 --> 23:49.862
There you go, looking good.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.297
Nice and slow.

23:51.331 --> 23:53.832
Put it in reverse.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.802
Just for a second. There you go. Perfect.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.971
Ah, there we go. All right.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.005
OK.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.809
- Tie it on for us.
- Here we go.

24:05.045 --> 24:07.846
Look at that, huh? She's a natural.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.114
All right!

24:09.149 --> 24:10.983
All right.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.785
- I'm gonna get a few things.
- OK.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.789
I'll be back in a flash,
and don't rock the boat.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.559
He is such a nerd.

24:20.594 --> 24:21.660
He seems like a good dad.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.964
Yeah, he is.

24:24.998 --> 24:26.498
You know, it must be weird for you,

24:26.533 --> 24:28.500
just being here.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.769
Kind of like seeing what
would have happened if

24:30.804 --> 24:33.405
our dad would have stayed with your mom.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.609
Well, kinda, yeah.

24:38.345 --> 24:40.613
But, you know, everything
happens for a reason.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.281
If you think about it,

24:42.315 --> 24:44.383
if your dad would have stayed with my mom,

24:44.417 --> 24:45.684
there'd be no Jude.

24:45.719 --> 24:47.353
And there'd be no you.

24:47.387 --> 24:50.623
Yeah, might not be such a bad thing.

24:56.204 --> 25:00.040
Sounds like you and Callie
found a wonderful home.

25:00.075 --> 25:03.244
Yeah, I mean, we didn't
grow up together but...

25:03.278 --> 25:05.346
the Fosters really feel like
our brothers and sisters.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.949
- And Callie's happy?
- Yeah.

25:08.984 --> 25:10.985
As happy as Callie can be, anyway.

25:13.368 --> 25:17.237
So, um, why did she run away?

25:17.272 --> 25:21.241
She thought they might not
want to adopt both of us.

25:21.276 --> 25:23.177
Why did she think that?

25:25.880 --> 25:27.114
I don't know.

25:28.149 --> 25:30.984
I mean, it's not true, right?

25:31.019 --> 25:33.654
They still want to adopt her, right?

25:33.688 --> 25:34.788
Oh, yeah. Totally.

25:34.823 --> 25:37.725
They're just... waiting on you guys.

25:39.994 --> 25:41.795
Why not?

25:41.830 --> 25:43.564
Because those are the rules, Mariana.

25:43.598 --> 25:44.898
People were taking advantage

25:44.933 --> 25:47.568
and using things like
bake sales and car washes

25:47.602 --> 25:49.703
to funnel a ton of money
into their own kids' programs,

25:49.738 --> 25:51.638
and the parent board
decided that it wasn't fair.

25:51.673 --> 25:54.742
But can't you, like, bend
the rules, just this once?

25:54.776 --> 25:56.510
I mean, aren't you the acting principal?

25:56.544 --> 25:58.479
But how would that look if
I start making exceptions

25:58.513 --> 25:59.780
for my own kids?

25:59.814 --> 26:01.615
The answer is no. Period.

26:01.649 --> 26:05.419
- Fine, thanks for nothing.
- You're welcome.

26:07.489 --> 26:08.756
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:08.790 --> 26:10.724
What are you doing at school on a Saturday?

26:10.759 --> 26:12.459
Band practice.

26:12.494 --> 26:13.594
"Someone's Little Sister"?

26:13.628 --> 26:16.497
No, uh, the other one. Nerd band.

26:18.366 --> 26:19.299
You?

26:19.334 --> 26:21.168
- Dance team.
- How was it?

26:21.202 --> 26:25.139
Well, um, we have competitions
coming up in a couple weeks,

26:25.173 --> 26:26.473
so Kaitlyn is on a rampage.

26:26.508 --> 26:29.176
And we don't have enough money
for everyone to go to L.A.,

26:29.210 --> 26:31.378
so I asked my mom if she
would help us raise some money

26:31.413 --> 26:34.248
but she said no... and I
just... I love being on the team,

26:34.282 --> 26:35.416
I just feel like they're gonna cut me...

26:35.450 --> 26:37.284
Hey, whoa. Slow down.

26:37.318 --> 26:41.054
Why are you looking for a backup plan?

26:41.089 --> 26:43.157
What does that have to do with dancing?

26:43.191 --> 26:45.092
I'm not as good as everyone else is.

26:45.126 --> 26:47.227
So work harder.

26:47.262 --> 26:49.163
But I'm never going to
be as good as they are.

26:49.197 --> 26:51.064
Well, not as long as you
believe that you're not.

26:51.099 --> 26:53.000
Why are you always up in my grill?

26:53.034 --> 26:54.768
"Up in your grill?"

26:57.739 --> 26:58.939
How about I tell you this Friday night?

26:58.973 --> 27:02.910
Hmm, sounds fun. A movie and a lecture.

27:02.944 --> 27:04.812
Yeah, how about we don't.

27:07.015 --> 27:10.751
Uh, so, no movie then?

27:16.591 --> 27:18.892
I can't believe that Mike thinks that

27:18.927 --> 27:22.629
Dani is gonna have some
miraculous explanation for this,

27:22.664 --> 27:24.598
some "side" that he needs to hear.

27:24.632 --> 27:25.899
- Stef.
- What?

27:25.934 --> 27:28.502
You're acting like Mike is to blame here.

27:28.536 --> 27:31.772
Do you honestly think, if he had
any inkling this was going to happen,

27:31.806 --> 27:33.707
that he would've have asked her to move in?

27:33.741 --> 27:36.643
Can you imagine how humiliated he must be.

27:36.678 --> 27:39.346
I can only imagine how
many red flags he ignored.

27:40.482 --> 27:42.449
He has terrible taste in women.

27:42.484 --> 27:46.587
- He married a lesbian.
- And you married a man.

27:46.621 --> 27:49.122
We all have our blind spots, Stef.

27:49.157 --> 27:50.524
Just don't be so hard on him.

27:50.558 --> 27:53.360
There's only one person here to
be angry with, and that's Dani.

27:53.394 --> 27:56.263
I'm... you think that I'm hard on him?

27:56.297 --> 27:58.098
- Stef.
- What?

27:58.132 --> 28:00.100
The only person in the world

28:00.134 --> 28:01.435
you're harder on than Mike is yourself.

28:03.071 --> 28:05.038
Any time the kids make a mistake or, hell,

28:05.073 --> 28:07.274
anyone you love makes a mistake,

28:07.308 --> 28:11.011
you take it all personally,
like you failed us,

28:11.045 --> 28:12.946
like you think you should've
been able to protect us

28:12.981 --> 28:15.082
from ourselves somehow.

28:15.116 --> 28:18.952
And I think that that extends to Mike.

28:18.987 --> 28:20.854
But with Mike, it's even worse,

28:20.889 --> 28:25.058
because on top of everything
else, you feel guilty.

28:27.996 --> 28:29.029
About?

28:29.063 --> 28:33.800
About leaving, about hurting him.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.838
Well, don't I sound like an ass.

28:37.872 --> 28:40.974
You're not an ass, honey,
not even a little bit.

28:41.009 --> 28:45.748
You just... love hard.

28:46.782 --> 28:49.561
- That's a good thing.
- But that's why Brandon came

28:50.512 --> 28:51.712
to you about this, right?

28:51.719 --> 28:55.355
Because I'm so hard on everyone?

29:12.473 --> 29:15.342
Hey, what are you still doing here?

29:16.578 --> 29:18.312
Practicing.

29:18.346 --> 29:20.581
Yeah, like you need to practice.

29:20.615 --> 29:22.349
Look, I know...

29:22.383 --> 29:24.151
I know you think these
moves come to me naturally

29:24.185 --> 29:27.120
because I'm black but...

29:27.155 --> 29:29.289
I'm just kidding.

29:31.092 --> 29:34.261
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

29:35.430 --> 29:38.398
So could I...

29:38.433 --> 29:40.334
Would you... help me?

29:40.368 --> 29:43.203
Yeah.

29:43.237 --> 29:45.038
Let's do this.

29:46.140 --> 29:48.175
Right, let's do this.

29:56.050 --> 29:59.786
Are you OK?

29:59.821 --> 30:02.856
- No.
- Me neither.

30:02.890 --> 30:04.691
At least we agree on that.

30:07.962 --> 30:09.863
I still don't understand
how this could happen.

30:11.065 --> 30:12.766
How I could let it happen.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.934
But you're right about one
thing, this is my fault.

30:13.968 --> 30:16.970
It's not... it's not your fault, Mike.

30:17.005 --> 30:18.639
I love you, Mike, I do,

30:18.673 --> 30:21.708
and I'm really sorry that
I've been so hard on you.

30:21.743 --> 30:22.909
It's a...

30:22.944 --> 30:26.480
Thanks but it wasn't exactly
easy being married to me.

30:26.514 --> 30:29.483
The problems in our marriage
were not all your fault.

30:29.517 --> 30:31.585
I wasn't exactly Mrs. Brady.

30:35.490 --> 30:36.723
You had her hair, remember?

30:36.808 --> 30:39.309
Right after we got married, the mullet?

30:39.310 --> 30:40.961
Oh, I beg your pardon,
that was not a mullet,

30:40.963 --> 30:43.380
that was a blunt, layered flip.

30:43.414 --> 30:45.282
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that,

30:45.316 --> 30:47.250
but I have photographic evidence.

30:50.288 --> 30:52.489
I don't blame you for the divorce, Stef.

30:54.592 --> 30:57.194
And we can't blame Brandon
for what happened with Dani.

30:58.463 --> 31:00.464
He made some bad decisions,
like drinking for one.

31:04.202 --> 31:06.336
I hope to God I didn't pass that on to him.

31:08.172 --> 31:10.107
But he's sixteen.

31:10.141 --> 31:11.274
What if this were Mariana?

31:11.309 --> 31:13.243
She's almost sixteen.

31:13.277 --> 31:18.014
What if she "agreed" to have
sex with a teacher at school?

31:18.049 --> 31:21.051
Would you blame her?

31:21.085 --> 31:23.787
- I mean, what would you do?
- I'd lock him up.

31:23.821 --> 31:25.055
So why is Brandon any different?

31:36.035 --> 31:37.235
Hey Jude!

31:37.270 --> 31:39.070
Get her to show you a sheet
bend, she needs the practice.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.273
Mm.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.880
I took those the summer we met.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.250
I can't believe you held onto them.

31:53.986 --> 31:58.757
So... Stef told me that
you had some concerns

31:58.791 --> 32:01.059
about accepting the college fund.

32:01.093 --> 32:04.729
You don't need to feel guilty, OK?

32:04.764 --> 32:10.669
I don't need a consolation
prize or a parting gift.

32:10.703 --> 32:12.003
I have my own plan.

32:12.038 --> 32:14.673
That's why I'm working,
to save up for college.

32:14.707 --> 32:16.575
Well, that's great.

32:16.609 --> 32:18.944
It's great but, you know,
it's hard to work and study.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.614
And it's gonna take you years
to save up for a semester.

32:22.648 --> 32:25.684
Your mother would have
wanted you to go to college.

32:25.718 --> 32:27.819
You know, she was always talking about...

32:27.853 --> 32:29.454
finishing her degree.

32:29.488 --> 32:31.356
Do you know if she ever went back?

32:31.390 --> 32:33.692
Uh, she took a couple night classes.

32:36.462 --> 32:38.363
Don't you think she
would've wanted this for you?

32:38.397 --> 32:43.468
Let me do this. Please, Callie, for her.

32:43.502 --> 32:45.370
I owe her that much.

32:45.404 --> 32:47.405
At least to help make her
dreams for you come true.

32:55.548 --> 32:58.450
Can I keep this one?

32:58.484 --> 33:00.418
You can keep any one you want.

33:04.490 --> 33:06.458
I'm sorta jealous you knew her then,

33:06.492 --> 33:11.162
when she was young and had
her whole life ahead of her.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.264
Yeah.

33:15.001 --> 33:17.235
It must've been hard to lose her so young.

33:22.008 --> 33:22.974
Thank you.

33:24.977 --> 33:26.878
For being so welcoming with Jude.

33:28.314 --> 33:32.017
And... for the college fund.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.152
I'd be stupid to turn that down, right?

33:40.092 --> 33:43.895
I think it's time we took the kids home.

33:43.929 --> 33:47.032
Yeah, OK. I'll get Jude.

33:49.135 --> 33:52.871
Thanks for coming, it
was a really nice day.

33:57.643 --> 33:58.777
Tommy's here. See you later, Moms!

33:58.811 --> 34:00.045
Don't be out late!

34:02.815 --> 34:03.948
Hey, what's going on?

34:04.984 --> 34:06.818
It's my parents.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.954
What's wrong? Is everything OK?

34:09.989 --> 34:11.755
They're getting a divorce.

34:12.792 --> 34:14.626
I'm so, so sorry.

34:14.659 --> 34:16.494
I just don't want to be alone tonight.

34:16.529 --> 34:17.795
Um...

34:17.830 --> 34:21.632
You know I have that, um, team dinner.

34:21.667 --> 34:24.469
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry.

34:24.503 --> 34:26.771
Of course I can't ask you to skip it.

34:26.806 --> 34:28.505
I'll be OK.

34:28.541 --> 34:31.772
Wait, wait, wait. I'll come with you.

34:31.781 --> 34:33.678
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

34:33.713 --> 34:36.681
Just tell the guys that they
don't have to come pick me up.

34:38.617 --> 34:40.418
Thanks.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.387
I don't know what I'd do without you.

35:21.227 --> 35:22.327
I'm so sorry.

35:29.235 --> 35:32.303
I wish I could take it back.

35:32.338 --> 35:36.275
Or at least tell you why I did it.

35:42.314 --> 35:45.950
I want you to be very careful
when it comes to drinking, Brandon.

35:48.220 --> 35:49.921
I don't want you ending up like me.

35:49.955 --> 35:52.857
God knows, I've made a lot of bad decisions

35:52.892 --> 35:53.892
when I've been drunk.

35:58.964 --> 36:02.066
Dad, I know how excited
you were to start over...

36:03.836 --> 36:06.738
... how much you wanted
to make a life with Dani.

36:09.008 --> 36:10.909
And I ruined it.

36:10.943 --> 36:13.611
No, Brandon, Dani's the adult.

36:13.646 --> 36:15.814
She had the responsibility to stop it,

36:15.848 --> 36:16.948
no matter how it started.

36:18.984 --> 36:24.589
And you might not feel this way,
but what she did was illegal.

36:24.623 --> 36:26.591
And we have to do something about it.

36:37.490 --> 36:40.559
- Jesus, come in here.
- Hey.

36:41.728 --> 36:44.329
So, how'd it go? The wrestling thing?

36:44.364 --> 36:45.597
Did you win "Most Improved"?

36:49.402 --> 36:52.204
- I didn't even go.
- What? Why?

36:53.473 --> 36:56.542
Hayley stopped by. She was a total mess.

36:56.576 --> 36:58.610
Her parents are getting divorced.

37:00.380 --> 37:03.449
- Well, she was really upset.
- About what?

37:03.483 --> 37:06.441
About the fact that her
parents are getting divorced.

37:06.442 --> 37:07.916
Why are you being so mean?

37:07.957 --> 37:10.389
Hayley's known about this for months.

37:10.523 --> 37:13.292
No, no. Well, it seemed
like they just told her.

37:13.326 --> 37:15.394
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

37:21.241 --> 37:22.231
_

37:29.442 --> 37:32.411
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:32.445 --> 37:35.013
How was the boat?

37:35.048 --> 37:38.951
Um, it was pretty fun.

37:38.985 --> 37:41.353
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:41.387 --> 37:42.354
How was your day?

37:45.191 --> 37:46.959
Long.

38:02.141 --> 38:05.911
So... moment of truth.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.081
What'd you think?

38:10.984 --> 38:13.952
To be honest...

38:13.987 --> 38:16.922
I wish you'd never found out about them.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.927
Well, thank you for telling me.

38:21.961 --> 38:23.862
That wasn't that hard, was it?

38:25.064 --> 38:26.932
Yeah, I don't have to see them again...

38:26.966 --> 38:30.002
Wait, I'm not done.

38:31.204 --> 38:33.739
I wish you never found out about them,

38:33.773 --> 38:36.875
but that's not gonna change anything.

38:40.847 --> 38:44.049
It sucks that I have to share you.

38:45.752 --> 38:50.856
But I guess if I learned how
to do it with the Fosters,

38:50.890 --> 38:52.791
then I can do it with Sophia, too.

38:56.162 --> 39:01.733
And... Robert and Jill,

39:01.768 --> 39:02.968
they seem pretty nice.

39:14.647 --> 39:21.653
- So did you have fun today?
- It's the best day ever.

39:24.757 --> 39:26.959
You know, I wish we could adopt Callie.

39:28.828 --> 39:31.897
Well, technically, we
wouldn't have to adopt her,

39:31.931 --> 39:33.966
but she's already got a
family. A family that loves her.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.837
Yeah, I know. But she's only
been with them for a few months.

39:38.871 --> 39:43.608
Maybe if she knew us longer,
she could learn to love us, too.

39:54.821 --> 39:55.921
Danielle Kirkland?
