better than I do.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.816
Be that as it may, my
previous comment stands.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.028
Who was on the phone
when the bomb threat
was made?

11:36.070 --> 11:38.489
My assistant, Cam Watkins.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.782
After I take a look at
the phone records,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.075
I need to speak with him.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.785
When you do,
I want to be there.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.578
That's not typically
how we do things.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.416
Be that as it may,
my previous comment stands.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.377
J.R.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.922
Why didn't you tell me
your mother was coming?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.841
That's what you want
to talk about?

11:56.882 --> 11:59.510
We're sheltered in place
because of a bomb threat.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.304
Exactly. A threat,
not an actual bomb.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.265
You don't know that.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.975
There could be a bomb
somewhere on campus.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.727
I need you to understand
the assignment.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.395
And I think the students
seeing a coach staying calm

12:09.437 --> 12:11.021
is the assignment.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.066
You realize that you
haven't asked me
am I OK?

12:14.108 --> 12:17.403
You have two sons
in the same
building with you.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.407
It's like you really
don't see me or Damon.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.123
Shanelle.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.041
Shanelle: Simone.
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

12:31.083 --> 12:32.835
Well, more or less,
I think.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.628
We've been praying
for y'all.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.630
The bomb threats are
all over the news.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.841
"Bomb threats"?
Plural?

12:38.883 --> 12:42.219
Yeah, another HBCU,
East Lennox University.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.513
They just confirmed it.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.227
How's Shay?

12:50.269 --> 12:51.896
Are you guys safe?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.857
I mean, who knows what
else could happen today?

12:54.899 --> 12:58.360
Shay's a little fussy, but
other than that, he's fine.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.154
Want to say hi?

13:00.196 --> 13:03.115
I would really love that.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.700
[Shay crying]

13:04.742 --> 13:08.037
Shanelle, what happened?
Is everything OK?

13:08.078 --> 13:12.166
[Alarm sounding]

13:12.208 --> 13:14.418
Shanelle? Hello?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.358
[Labored breathing]

13:40.611 --> 13:42.530
It was the cell phone
tower, the noise.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.073
It was being
shut down.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.574
How do you know?

13:45.616 --> 13:46.909
I can see the truck
from here.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.828
Look, the Wi-Fi's
down, too.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.496
It's probably just
the FBI doing their
thing, OK?

13:52.706 --> 13:55.543
I'm good, I'm good.
Thank you.

13:56.752 --> 14:01.715
OK. Breathe in
for 4 seconds,

14:01.757 --> 14:05.094
hold your breath for 7,

14:05.135 --> 14:09.306
and then exhale
for 8 seconds, OK?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.225
[Inhales]

14:14.144 --> 14:16.105
[Both exhale]

14:19.024 --> 14:21.402
[Both inhaling]

14:23.028 --> 14:25.614
[Both exhale]

14:27.408 --> 14:29.910
4-7-8 breathing.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.663
You get
panic attacks, too?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.582
Got them a lot
as a kid when my dad
was deployed.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.792
You were scared he
wasn't gonna make it back.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.544
Yeah.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.425
Now the parent is
worried about the child.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.303
We were on the phone when
everything went down.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.599
I have a son--Shay.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.269
We were on the phone when
everything went down, so...

14:55.311 --> 14:57.313
Your panic attack
was about him.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.359
[Exhales]

15:02.401 --> 15:05.779
These coordinated
bomb threats are
just a reminder...

15:07.489 --> 15:09.408
that there are spaces that
Shay won't be accepted in

15:09.450 --> 15:10.993
just because of how he looks

15:11.035 --> 15:12.786
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

15:16.874 --> 15:22.421
For now,
Shay's safe, OK?

15:22.463 --> 15:25.382
But there is something
you can do.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.177
I see a lot of people
who could use a friend

15:28.218 --> 15:30.262
or some help.

15:47.529 --> 15:51.492
Look, J., about Celine
and Jessie, I...

15:54.870 --> 16:00.000
um, actually, um,
mental health check.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.211
How you handling
all this, bro?

16:02.252 --> 16:04.797
You'd think I'd be used
to the fear of losing
my life by now.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.799
When I was a kid,
I thought

16:06.840 --> 16:09.301
aplastic anemia
had my number.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.512
I even made
a bucket list.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.806
For real?

16:13.847 --> 16:15.557
What was on it?

16:15.599 --> 16:17.309
Oh, the usuals--

16:17.351 --> 16:18.560
kiss a girl,
fight a ninja.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.479
Ninja? Ha ha!

16:20.521 --> 16:22.356
Damn if Mom and Dad
ain't try to hit
every item

16:22.398 --> 16:24.566
as if they ain't have
enough to deal with.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.068
What do you mean, what
they had to deal with?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.820
You was the one that
was sick, bro.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.197
Mm-mm. If one person
in the family is
that badly sick,

16:30.239 --> 16:31.699
everyone is.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.952
Damon, Mom and Dad
argued a lot,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.371
about my care,
how to pay for it.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.000
And the stresses of
that led to...

16:41.041 --> 16:43.043
led to Mom's affair.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.672
Growing up, I fooled
myself into thinking

16:46.714 --> 16:49.508
that our lives
were perfect,

16:49.550 --> 16:51.093
that we were happy.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.179
And we weren't
and they weren't.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.140
And for 18 years,
you didn't know
where you came from

16:56.181 --> 16:58.809
because Mom and Dad
couldn't handle
two kids.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.354
My illness hit different
for all of y'all,

17:02.396 --> 17:03.981
and I feel
responsible for it.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.567
Look, no, I know
I shouldn't, but I do.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.654
I'm working through it
with my shrink.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.114
Why did it take
a bomb threat

17:12.156 --> 17:13.615
for you to tell me
all this?

17:13.657 --> 17:15.075
Felt selfish
given everything.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.119
You can talk to me
about anything.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.496
You hear me?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.623
Damon...

17:24.251 --> 17:26.420
I'm scared, bro.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.092
Yeah, man.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.594
Me, too.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.304
Nico: As your SGA president,
I'll demand that

17:35.345 --> 17:38.223
Dr. Patterson make
our safety her priority.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.850
First order of business,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.393
adding police officers
to campus.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.436
Student: Yup, mm-hmm.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.437
Nathaniel: I don't--

17:43.479 --> 17:45.064
I don't know about that.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.608
Bringing cops to a school
full of Black students

17:47.649 --> 17:49.401
doesn't seem like the move.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.987
People who make
bomb threats
against HBCUs

17:52.029 --> 17:55.824
are violent individuals
who need to be met with
strength and force.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.701
Nathaniel: But sometimes...

17:57.743 --> 17:59.536
the people that are
supposed to have our backs

17:59.578 --> 18:01.830
end up being
our greatest threat.

18:01.872 --> 18:05.459
Nate, I love you, but
you're wrong about this,
so why don't you--

18:05.501 --> 18:07.544
Keisha: Excuse me.
Nate: Keisha, it's OK.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.671
No. no. For the record,
Nate knows exactly
what she's talking about.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.173
She's stood up to more
cops on this campus

18:11.215 --> 18:13.300
that tried to shut down
our right to protest

18:13.342 --> 18:15.260
than anyone else
in this building.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.096
That's funny. So the former
president's daughter,

18:17.137 --> 18:19.431
who lives in a big house,
knows about struggle.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.433
Keisha: OK, well, at least
I'm not an insecure man

18:21.475 --> 18:23.018
who feels the need to
silence other people

18:23.060 --> 18:25.229
to make himself feel better.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.855
No. I'm the guy trying
to get things done
for this student body.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.857
Well, then maybe you
should do less talking

18:28.899 --> 18:30.859
and more listening
because it's clear you're
only about yourself.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.862
I would argue that's
your issue.

18:33.904 --> 18:35.781
Nate, I hope you're
seeing this.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.580
Simone: Excuse me,
everyone. Can I please
have your attention?

18:43.622 --> 18:47.334
A lot of you may not know me,
but my name is Simone Hicks.

18:47.376 --> 18:54.049
And as uncertain and scary
as today is,

18:54.091 --> 18:55.717
we have to be here
for each other.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.678
We should really talk about
what's happening.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.805
It might do us some good.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.014
What did the caller
say exactly?

19:01.056 --> 19:02.766
Agent Hunt, what are
you doing?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.560
I mentioned I'd need
to speak to Cam Watkins

19:04.601 --> 19:06.436
since he's the one
answered the call.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.276
And I said I wanted
to be there when you did.

19:12.317 --> 19:16.697
Mr. Watkins, what did
the caller say exactly?

19:19.032 --> 19:22.536
That he hid explosives
in the west campus,

19:22.578 --> 19:26.498
and he chose Bringston
because...

19:29.126 --> 19:31.295
there are too many
Black students here.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.631
Thea: Well, being
a majority Black school
makes us a target.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.092
So does being the only
Black speck at a PWI.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.094
We should get to have
our own space, right?

19:39.136 --> 19:40.804
That's naive.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.389
We all know that when we
come together,

19:42.431 --> 19:44.057
excellence happens,
and that threatens them.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.559
-Exactly.
-Right, right.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.269
We put ourselves
in the line of fire.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.897
You're playing
their game.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.399
Whenever we get terrorized,
they always find a way
to flip it and blame us.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.443
Hunt: Mr. Watkins,
your memory of
the call's impressive.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.069
Most people
in your situation

19:56.111 --> 19:58.071
wouldn't be able
to remember so thoroughly.

19:58.113 --> 19:59.573
Look, man,
if you got something
to say, just say it.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.284
Your responses seem
rehearsed.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.369
Was this call real,
or is this a prank?

20:04.411 --> 20:05.579
Maybe you heard about
the threat at East Lennox
and wanted--

20:05.621 --> 20:06.580
Man. I ain't got
to do--

20:06.622 --> 20:07.706
Uh-uh.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.583
Cam Watkins is

20:09.625 --> 20:12.211
one of the most upstanding
students on campus.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.422
If he says the call
happened, it did.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.425
This isn't a prank.
It's a pattern.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.093
How do you not see that?

20:20.135 --> 20:22.137
The 16th Street
Baptist Church bombing,

20:22.179 --> 20:24.056
the Tulsa Race Massacre,

20:24.097 --> 20:25.807
the Charleston church
shooting.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.143
Guys, we have
a long history of
attacks against us.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.062
Exactly. This isn't new,
which is why I'm

20:30.103 --> 20:32.689
shrugging off
this bomb threat.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.068
It's just another instance
of fill in the blank
while being Black.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.569
Well, it's really sad
that you're desensitized

20:37.611 --> 20:39.071
to your own trauma.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.948
Maybe this is how
I'm strong and resilient.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.449
Lando: The problem
with being told

20:42.491 --> 20:44.034
to stay strong
and persevere is

20:44.076 --> 20:46.036
that it invalidates
our human emotions.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.247
But our society
constantly validates

20:48.288 --> 20:52.167
people who commit violence
against people of color

20:52.209 --> 20:54.836
when more needs to be done
to protect Black students.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.380
Cam.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.758
Tootie: Yeah, and maybe
this whole discussion thing

20:59.800 --> 21:02.135
was a really bad idea,
Simone.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.553
[Indistinct conversations]

21:03.595 --> 21:05.514
Amara: Your line of
questioning

21:05.555 --> 21:07.015
was out of line.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.142
Cam is a victim.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.521
Trust me.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.189
Cam Watkins doing this
as a prank

21:14.231 --> 21:15.732
would have been
preferable.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.526
To what exactly?

21:17.567 --> 21:19.278
The other threat,
at East Lennox University.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.446
My colleagues
just radioed in.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.990
They found a device.

21:23.031 --> 21:24.992
They were able to defuse
it a few minutes ago.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.786
So if the Bringston
bomb threat isn't a prank

21:27.828 --> 21:29.413
and is part of a pattern--

21:29.454 --> 21:31.123
There's a good chance
a device

21:31.164 --> 21:33.083
really is somewhere
at Bringston.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.227
Yo, hey, we saw
the FBI interrogating you.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.562
What--what's up?

21:55.772 --> 21:57.399
[Scoffs]

21:57.441 --> 21:59.860
How long it take 'em?

21:59.901 --> 22:02.362
Five minutes.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.072
I went from a victim
to a suspect in 5 minutes

22:04.114 --> 22:05.574
just sitting in a damn chair.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.034
J.R.: That's messed up.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.536
The whole situation
is trash, bro.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.163
Man, Bringston's supposed
to be different than
the rest of the world.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.956

what Bringston is.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.300
For us, by us.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.926
Those are dope words and all,

22:24.968 --> 22:28.055
but the truth is,
they gonna always find a way

22:28.096 --> 22:30.182
to tear us down.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.396
Hey! Where the hell
are you going?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.607
None of your business.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.108
Fine. I hope wherever
you're going is worth
risking your life.

willing to do
anything for a guy.

No. You sound like
a woman

who's willing to do
whatever for the man
that they love.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.707
I mean, if it'll help,
I've done

22:55.749 --> 22:57.834
something out of love
that I'd later regret.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.715
To take my mind off of
worrying about Shay,

23:03.757 --> 23:06.385
I basically tried to
mother everyone else.

23:06.426 --> 23:12.057
Yeah. It feels really weird
loving someone so much

23:12.099 --> 23:14.893
that I wasn't even thinking
of the harm to myself.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.604
I just...

23:17.646 --> 23:19.773

to tell him.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.401
And you will.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.569
You have to hold on to
that belief that we'll
make it out.

having this nice moment,

I need you to do
something for me.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.209
OK. I messed up.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.336
I was wrong
earlier.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.630
Talking is not
what we should be doing.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.091

waiting for our world
to end ain't it either.

about y'all, but I

for us to run around here,

but I know what I
want, Coach,

but what if it blows up
in my face?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.849
I don't know the words
for this.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.976
You'll find them.
I have no doubt.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.229
But don't let anything
that should be said

the middle of a bomb threat

and your partner is missing.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.877
Why aren't you worried?

25:03.919 --> 25:05.962
Because I'm positive that
Nate is somewhere safe

25:06.004 --> 25:07.714
and she'll come back
when she's ready.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.133
She gets like this.
She just needs a minute.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.470
Wow. You really are trash.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.431
Am I? Or is it the fact
that I know Nate
better than you

25:16.473 --> 25:18.725
and that is what's
really bothering you?

25:20.602 --> 25:22.979
No. What really scares me
is that Nate

25:23.021 --> 25:25.315
won't see you for
who you actually are,

25:25.357 --> 25:27.317
and that one day,
when she really needs you,

25:27.359 --> 25:28.944
you won't be there.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.071

isn't today.

to let things that
should be said

And, look, I'm not gonna lie.
I thought it was an excuse,

that y'all didn't
want me to mess up

26:43.852 --> 26:45.812

Now I know that your
lives weren't perfect.
They were far from it,

and what you actually
gave me was...

26:52.694 --> 26:54.321
was a gift.

I had an amazing life
with my adoptive parents,

had you not given me up.

was for Celine,

I know I have more
to atone for.

give you up out of
my own selfishness,

for that.
