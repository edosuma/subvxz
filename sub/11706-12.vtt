16:39.957 --> 16:41.375
{\an8}DON'T FALL THOUGH.
IT'S A BAD LOOK.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.253
{\an8}- WHERE'S MY SHIRT?
YOU FOUND IT?

16:44.336 --> 16:48.006
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO GO DOWN?
- I WANT TO SMUSH AGAIN. DO YOU?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.509
{\an8}- DAMN, IT STINKS
IN THIS HOUSE.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.010
{\an8}- SMELLS LIKE BAND-AIDS.
- THIS IS MY HOME.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.848
{\an8}THIS IS MICHAEL.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.223
{\an8}- KATIE.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.478
{\an8}- I LIVE HERE.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.313
{\an8}- YOU HAVING ONE?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.522
{\an8}- WHY SO SAD?

17:04.606 --> 17:05.523
{\an8}CHEER UP.
WHERE'S YOUR GIRL?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.608
{\an8}- I WASN'T FEELING
ANYBODY TONIGHT.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.028
{\an8}IT'S A GRENADE-FREE
AMERICA.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.487
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY?

17:10.570 --> 17:12.281
{\an8}YOU SAYING I'M A GRENADE?
- NO. [laughs]

17:12.364 --> 17:13.490
{\an8}- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

17:13.574 --> 17:14.950
{\an8}THEY WEREN'T
THAT BAD-LOOKING.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.993
{\an8}BUT THERE WAS A BUNCH
OF GRENADES IN AZTEC.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.662
{\an8}AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A BUNCH OF GRENADES,

17:18.746 --> 17:20.289
{\an8}IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DEALING WITH
THE BEST-LOOKING UGLY CHICK.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.958
{\an8}- YOU WANNA JUST LIKE HAVE FUN
WHILE WE TAKE SHOTS?

17:23.040 --> 17:25.502
{\an8}- UH, YES.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.588
{\an8}I'M HAVING FUN.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.006
{\an8}I'M PUTTING IN WORK
WITH MY GIRL.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.799
{\an8}I'M MAKING HER FEEL COMFORTABLE,
DRINKING WITH HER.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.427
{\an8}YO, THIS IS DJ PAULY D!

17:33.510 --> 17:35.929
{\an8}[humming, laughing]

17:36.013 --> 17:37.890
{\an8}[knock at door]

17:37.973 --> 17:39.391
{\an8}- SOMEBODY'S
KNOCKING AT THE DOOR.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.601
{\an8}- I GOT THIS ONE.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.978
{\an8}- WHO THE [bleep]
IS AT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW?

17:43.061 --> 17:44.521
{\an8}- COME ON IN.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.856
{\an8}IT'S HER BROTHER.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.983
{\an8}- WHY IS YOUR BROTHER
IN MY HOUSE?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.152
{\an8}- MY GIRL WAS DTF,

17:50.235 --> 17:52.613
{\an8}BUT SOMETIMES
WHEN FAMILY GETS INVOLVED,

17:52.696 --> 17:55.866
{\an8}UH, YOU KNOW, IT JUST
GETS A LITTLE BIT TOO WEIRD.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.826
{\an8}WHAT THE HELL?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.536
{\an8}ERIN, WHY IS YOUR BROTHER
IN MY HOUSE?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.288
{\an8}- EVERYBODY'S COMIN' AT ME!

18:01.371 --> 18:03.290
{\an8}- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

18:03.373 --> 18:05.667
{\an8}ARE YOU TAKING THE GIRLS
FROM THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.086
{\an8}IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO?

18:07.169 --> 18:07.795
{\an8}- NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

18:07.878 --> 18:10.005
{\an8}- I'LL GO HOME TONIGHT.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.132
{\an8}IF NOT, I'LL COME BACK
TOMORROW MORNING.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.884
{\an8}- HE PRETTY MUCH WANTS TO KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GETTING HOME

18:13.967 --> 18:15.427
{\an8}AND HOW YOU'RE GETTING HOME.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.137
{\an8}IF YOU'RE NOT LEAVING TONIGHT,
HE'S GONNA GO HOME.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.305
{\an8}- IN MY MIND,
LIKE A LIGHT BULB WENT OFF.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.308
{\an8}I'M LIKE, DING!

18:24.353 --> 18:26.647
{\an8}CAN YOU GIVE HER A RIDE
NOW WITH YOU?

18:26.730 --> 18:27.523
{\an8}- CAN YOU GIVE HER
A RIDE TOMORROW?

18:27.606 --> 18:30.484
{\an8}- YEAH.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.527
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.986
{\an8}SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
PLAN DISTINGUISHED.

18:33.070 --> 18:35.072
{\an8}- [laughing]
- HE'S GONNA GIVE...

18:35.155 --> 18:38.116
{\an8}HER A RIDE TONIGHT
AND HER A RIDE TOMORROW.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.409
{\an8}LET'S GO!
- YOU'RE A [bleep] DICK.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.204
{\an8}- OH!

18:42.287 --> 18:44.206

18:44.289 --> 18:46.667
{\an8}I'D RATHER [bleep] MIKE

18:46.750 --> 18:47.960
{\an8}- OH!

18:48.043 --> 18:50.003
{\an8}[laughter, chatter]

18:50.087 --> 18:52.214
{\an8}SERIOUSLY,
THAT'S [bleep] UP.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.215
{\an8}- I DON'T MIND LEAVING THEM.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.801
{\an8}- YOU [bleep] DICK.
- YOU GOT IT.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.511
{\an8}YOU'RE THE HERO.
GO. TAKE 'EM HOME.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.096
{\an8}THEY'RE BOTH GONNA
GO HOME WITH YOU.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.764
{\an8}- OH, BOTH!

19:00.848 --> 19:02.057
{\an8}- THEY'RE BOTH GONNA
GO HOME WITH YOU.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.100
{\an8}AT THIS POINT, IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE TOO AWKWARD,

19:03.183 --> 19:05.602
{\an8}SO GIRLS GOTTA GET
THE [bleep] OUT.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.436
{\an8}- I JUST WANNA SAY...

19:06.520 --> 19:08.397
{\an8}- I THINK IT'S JUST BETTER

19:08.480 --> 19:09.690
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.899
{\an8}- TAKE CARE.
BRUSH YOUR HAIR.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.067
{\an8}NO, THAT'S THE DOOR
RIGHT THERE.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.569
{\an8}THAT'S THE DOOR RIGHT THERE.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.195
{\an8}- WOW! VINNY G STEPPIN' UP!

19:15.279 --> 19:18.323
{\an8}- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- I LOVE YOU GUYS.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.617
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T SEEN VINNY G
LIKE THIS.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.953
{\an8}- I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.
HATE TO BOTHER YOU.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.497
{\an8}- WHOA!

19:25.581 --> 19:27.082
{\an8}- THOSE PIERCINGS
CHANGED HIM.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.542
{\an8}- DUDE, LET'S BE REAL.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.085
{\an8}YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR PASTRIES

19:30.168 --> 19:31.920
{\an8}AND, LIKE, COFFEE.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.755
{\an8}YOU CAME HERE TO DO SEX
WITH PAULY AND VINNY.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.090
{\an8}YOU EMBARRASSED YOURSELF.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.092
{\an8}- NAW, VINNY, VINNY,
YOU DID THE RIGHT--

19:37.175 --> 19:39.261
{\an8}- I WAS LOOKING AT HER
[bleep] FACE,

19:39.344 --> 19:40.804
{\an8}I'M LIKE--
THERE'S NO WAY IN THE WORLD

19:40.888 --> 19:42.431
{\an8}THAT GIRL CAN EVER
COME IN MY BED.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.473
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, SNOOKI.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.268
{\an8}- OH!

19:46.351 --> 19:47.895
{\an8}WOW!

19:47.978 --> 19:49.313
{\an8}I'M JUST KIDDING.
I LOVE YOU.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.690
{\an8}- WOW!

19:51.773 --> 19:54.776
{\an8}- I'M KIDDING.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.405
{\an8}KIDDING! NICOLE,
NICOLE, I LOVE YOU.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.490
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY, GET OFF.
- NICOLE, I'M KIDDING.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.451
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
ANYBODY'S LAST RESORT.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.453
{\an8}I'M SOMEBODY'S
FIRST PRIORITY.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.371
{\an8}AND I'M NOT GONNA DEAL
WITH THAT WITH VINNY.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.916
{\an8}- PUNCH ME.
PUNCH ME.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.959
{\an8}NICOLE, PUNCH ME.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.711
{\an8}- VINNY--

20:12.794 --> 20:14.796
{\an8}I'M JUST KIDDING!

20:14.880 --> 20:17.132
{\an8}NO, STOP, STOP, NICOLE.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.009
{\an8}NICOLE, I'M KIDDING,
IDIOT.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.802
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY?
- NO, STOP.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.221
{\an8}- YOU'RE AN [bleep].

20:22.304 --> 20:23.805
{\an8}- SEE MY GIRL SAM?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.891
{\an8}SHE'S THE SNEAKIEST BITCH
YOU'LL EVER MEET!

20:25.974 --> 20:28.644
{\an8}all: OH!

20:28.727 --> 20:31.063
{\an8}- YO, YOU BETTER WATCH WHERE
YOU SLEEP TONIGHT, MY DUDE.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.814
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU GETTING INVOLVED
IN MY BUSINESS?

20:32.898 --> 20:33.607
{\an8}- YO, YO, FIRST OF ALL,
HE DIDN'T SAY

20:33.690 --> 20:35.484
{\an8}THAT YOU GUYS WERE FRIENDS.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.735
{\an8}HE'S LIKE, "SHE'S WITH RON?
SHE TOLD ME HE ENDED IT."

20:36.818 --> 20:38.445
{\an8}- THAT'S A CROCK.

20:42.074 --> 20:42.950
{\an8}all: OH! WOW!

20:43.033 --> 20:46.495
{\an8}- I'M JUST KIDDING!

20:46.578 --> 20:49.331
{\an8}- YOU JUST [bleep] YOURSELF.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.499
{\an8}- IT WAS A JOKE.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.875
{\an8}- YOU ALWAYS [bleep]
DO [bleep] LIKE THAT.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.251
{\an8}- LIKE WHAT?
LIKE WHAT? LIKE WHAT?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.754
{\an8}LIKE WHAT?
I'M JUST KIDDING.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.255
{\an8}- SNOOKI HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT VINNY

20:57.339 --> 21:00.259
{\an8}BECAUSE VINNY WAS
A DOUCHE BAG.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.677
{\an8}AND AFTER
KICKING OUT THE GIRLS

21:01.760 --> 21:03.011
{\an8}THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO D.T.F. WITH,

21:03.095 --> 21:03.804
{\an8}HE PRETTY MUCH PLAYED OUT
SNOOKI IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.056
{\an8}IT WASN'T NICE.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.684
{\an8}- NICOLE, I'M SERIOUS.
STOP. I'M KIDDING.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.477
{\an8}- NO, YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT
[bleep] WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.312
{\an8}- I ALWAYS? THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME I EVER DID IT.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.689
{\an8}IT WAS A [bleep] JOKE.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.148
{\an8}- EVERY TIME YOU SAY
YOU'RE DRUNK YOU'RE LIKE,

21:15.232 --> 21:17.192
{\an8}"OH, COME SNUGGLE ME.
COME DO THIS, COME DO THAT."

21:17.275 --> 21:18.902
{\an8}- YOU DO THAT [bleep].
I DON'T DO THAT [bleep].

21:18.986 --> 21:20.195
{\an8}I DON'T DO THAT [bleep].
YOU DO THAT [bleep].

21:20.278 --> 21:21.571
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN GET VINNY,

21:21.655 --> 21:23.073
{\an8}'CAUSE WHEN HE'S DRUNK
HE SAYS ONE THING.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.825
{\an8}AND THEN HE'S SOBER,
AND HE SAYS ANOTHER.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.076
{\an8}WHEN WE'RE BOTH SOBER,

21:26.159 --> 21:27.536
{\an8}THAT'S WHEN I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.579
{\an8}- NICOLE, YOU DO THAT--
WHAT?

21:29.663 --> 21:31.581
{\an8}- WHEN SNOOKI'S DRUNK, SHE
TRIES TO SNUGGLE WITH ME.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.749
{\an8}I WANT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

21:32.833 --> 21:33.875
{\an8}AND THEN WHEN I'M DRUNK,

21:33.959 --> 21:35.210
{\an8}SNOOKI WANTS NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

21:35.293 --> 21:36.878
{\an8}YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I'M DOING
THE SAME THING TO HER.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.213
{\an8}- WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE GIRLS HERE,

21:38.296 --> 21:39.715
{\an8}THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT
TO CUDDLE WITH ME.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.883
{\an8}AND THAT'S LIKE PUTTING ME
IN SECOND PLACE.

21:41.967 --> 21:42.884
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE THAT.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.052
{\an8}- I'M SORRY!

21:44.136 --> 21:45.595
{\an8}- OKAY.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.221
{\an8}- LET'S GO HAVE SEX.

21:46.304 --> 21:48.140
{\an8}- SEE WHAT I MEAN?

21:48.223 --> 21:52.519
{\an8}- I'M KIDDING.
I KNOW YOU LIKE SEX, IDIOT.

21:52.602 --> 21:53.645
{\an8}- STOP.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.563
{\an8}GET OFF.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.481
{\an8}- NO, STOP.
I WANNA TALK TO YOU.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.358
{\an8}- EVERY TIME I WANT VINNY,
HE SAY NO.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.818
{\an8}SO IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME.

21:59.901 --> 22:00.944
{\an8}AND IF I GIVE IN LIKE THAT,

22:01.028 --> 22:02.612
{\an8}IT MAKES ME LOOK
LIKE A STUPID ASS.

22:02.696 --> 22:03.530
{\an8}SO I'M NOT PLAYING
THAT GAME.

22:03.613 --> 22:05.198
{\an8}- YOU'RE GOING
TO BED WITH ME.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.533
{\an8}- NO, I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.369
{\an8}DON'T TOUCH MY EARS.
THEY JUST GOT PIERCED.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.871
{\an8}WRAP YOUR LEGS AROUND ME.
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.247
{\an8}- YOU'VE CHANGED, BRO.

22:12.330 --> 22:13.957
{\an8}- UH-OH.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.250
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA HAVE SEX
IN THE AIR.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.918
{\an8}- YO, WHAT DID THIS GUY DRINK?

22:17.002 --> 22:18.170
{\an8}I SWEAR HE DIDN'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TO DRINK.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.006
{\an8}- ARE THEY MAKING OUT?

22:21.089 --> 22:24.134
{\an8}- YO, HE HAD, LIKE,
TWO DRINKS, BRO.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.469
{\an8}- EVEN THOUGH IT'S A JOKE,
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.262
{\an8}IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MAKING ME
LOOK LIKE AN ASS[bleep].

22:27.346 --> 22:28.013
{\an8}- YO, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.306
{\an8}- YO, TABLES HAVE TURNED.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.600
{\an8}- I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU, BRO.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.060
{\an8}- YOU PUT EARRINGS ON, BRO.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.227
{\an8}- NICOLE, I WANT--

22:34.311 --> 22:36.104
{\an8}SERIOUSLY I THOUGHT WE WERE
CLOSER THAN THAT.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.105
{\an8}FOR REAL.

22:37.189 --> 22:37.773
{\an8}I THOUGHT WE WERE
CLOSER THAN THAT.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.610
{\an8}FOR REAL.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.235
{\an8}- YO, YOU LIKE
MY NEW JORDANS,

22:42.319 --> 22:44.237
{\an8}THE KOOL-AID KICKS?

22:44.321 --> 22:45.238
{\an8}- LOOK AT WHAT I DID, VIN.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.448
{\an8}- ARE YOU [bleep] SERIOUS?

22:46.531 --> 22:49.826
{\an8}DEENA, GET THE [bleep] KOOL-AID
OFF THE WHITE RIGHT NOW.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.369
{\an8}- DON'T YELL AT MY ROOMMATE.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.956

FOR, LIKE, A HALF HOUR

30:49.597 --> 30:50.932
{\an8}TO RONNIE'S MOM.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.350

30:52.433 --> 30:56.312
{\an8}- MIKE TOLD RONNIE'S MOM
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.773
{\an8}JUST NOW.
- WHY?

30:58.856 --> 31:01.859
{\an8}- DON'T SAY ANYTHING YET.
WAIT TILL YOU TALK TO HIM.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.319
{\an8}- ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING?

31:03.403 --> 31:06.739
{\an8}- YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

{\an8}AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME.

31:12.495 --> 31:15.415
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GO PUNCH HIM

31:15.498 --> 31:18.084
{\an8}HE'S A [bleep] DIRTY LITTLE
[bleep] GRIMY SCUMBAG.

{\an8}HE WAS ON THE PHONE
TELLING YOUR MOM

31:26.551 --> 31:28.636
{\an8}EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON HERE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.721
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE THAT.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.514
{\an8}I'LL [bleep] KILL HIM
RIGHT NOW.

31:31.598 --> 31:34.017
{\an8}- WHY WOULD HE TELL HER THAT?

31:34.100 --> 31:36.811
{\an8}- RON, I'M LIKE THIS.

31:36.894 --> 31:38.187

IS I'M GOING TO CALL,

31:42.734 --> 31:44.319
{\an8}AND YOU CAN BE
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.862
{\an8}I WANTED HIM TO SAY EVERYTHING

31:45.945 --> 31:47.280
{\an8}HE COULD POSSIBLY SAY,

31:47.363 --> 31:48.656
{\an8}AND THEN YOU COULD DISPUTE IT.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.158
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU GETTING
INVOLVED IN MY BUSINESS?

31:50.241 --> 31:54.037

{\an8}THIS DUDE I USED TO HANG
OUT WITH AND USED TO HANG OUT--

32:55.807 --> 32:57.016
{\an8}SAM USED TO BE
IN THE GIRL CLIQUE.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.351
{\an8}THAT WAS THE DUDE CLIQUE.

32:58.434 --> 32:59.102
{\an8}NO JOKE,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE,

32:59.185 --> 33:01.020

{\an8}SHE SWEATED THIS KID.
SHE SWEATED THIS KID.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.108
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HOOKED UP.
I THOUGHT THEY DID.

{\an8}- COULD YOU GUYS, LIKE,
MAYBE NEUTRAL IT,

33:15.284 --> 33:18.579
{\an8}BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU HIT UP
A GIRL IN MIAMI?

33:18.663 --> 33:19.997
{\an8}- BUT THEY ALREADY
NEUTRALED THAT.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.082
{\an8}- WE STARTED IT CLEAN HERE.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.251
{\an8}- AND I SAY THEY START
WITH A ZERO-ZERO,

33:23.334 --> 33:26.087
{\an8}BECAUSE HE ADMITTED
HIS WRONGS TO THAT.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.672
{\an8}THIS GIRL'S STILL
NEVER ADMITTING.

33:27.755 --> 33:28.756
{\an8}SHE'S DENYING,
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.508
{\an8}BUT SHE LEAVES HE HOUSE
FOR ONE DAY

33:30.591 --> 33:32.635
{\an8}AND HITS THIS GUY.

33:32.719 --> 33:33.970
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE THAT.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.275
{\an8}AND I THINK ALL THE BOYS
ARE BRAINWASHING RONNIE.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.527

I--

33:49.610 --> 33:50.778
{\an8}- YEAH, SHE'S TOTALLY WRONG.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.572
{\an8}WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO
IS YOUR CHOICE.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.365
{\an8}- SHE SHOULDA CALLED--
SHE CALLED YOU,

33:54.449 --> 33:57.118
{\an8}SOME GIRLFRIENDS,
HER SISTER, HER MOTHER.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.286
{\an8}NOT SOME RANDOM DUDE

33:58.369 --> 33:59.495
{\an8}THAT COMES TO MEET HER
AT A CLUB BY HIMSELF.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.831
{\an8}HE CAME BY HIMSELF.

34:01.914 --> 34:02.915
{\an8}- IT KINDA SEEMED
LIKE MIKE'S STIRRING THE POT

34:02.999 --> 34:04.125
{\an8}AND BEING AN INSTIGATOR,

34:04.208 --> 34:05.668
{\an8}BUT I THINK MIKE IS ACTUALLY
BEING A FRIEND

34:05.752 --> 34:07.754
{\an8}AND LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.422
{\an8}- DUDE, I'M NOT
HAVING IT, DUDE.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.255
{\an8}I HAVE TO [bleep] PROTECT
THIS KID.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.466
{\an8}HE'S CRYING ON MY SHOULDER.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.801
{\an8}HE ORDERS HER ROSES,
AND THEN SHE TEXTS THIS KID?

34:13.885 --> 34:15.511
{\an8}IT'S PRINCIPLE THAT SHE--
THE INTENTION.

34:15.594 --> 34:18.056
{\an8}AND THAT INTENTION,
ONCE YOU CROSS THAT LINE,

34:18.139 --> 34:20.391
{\an8}THAT INTENTION LINE,
IT'S [bleep] HORRIBLE.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.476
{\an8}IT'S NO GOOD.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.268
{\an8}YOU DO NOT LET A GIRL
DO THIS TO YOU.

34:23.351 --> 34:26.647
{\an8}YOU'RE GETTING PLAYED,
PUNKED, DISRESPECTED.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.440
{\an8}I FEEL VERY STRONGLY
ABOUT THIS.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.817
{\an8}- HE DID COME BY HIMSELF,
RIGHT?

34:29.900 --> 34:32.235
{\an8}- YEAH.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.280
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:34.362 --> 34:36.491
{\an8}- LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE ALL TALKING.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.659
{\an8}- YOU WERE JUST OUT THERE.
WHAT'D HE SAY?

34:39.744 --> 34:40.953
{\an8}- MIKE WAS TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE,

34:41.036 --> 34:42.663
{\an8}HE WAS LIKE, "THIS IS
THE DUDE THAT SHE'LL BE WITH

34:42.746 --> 34:45.123
{\an8}IF SHE'S NOT WITH YOU."

34:45.208 --> 34:47.460
{\an8}- HELL NO.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.213
{\an8}- I WALKED AWAY.
- HELL NO.

34:50.295 --> 34:51.755
{\an8}- I STUMBLED UPON IT.

34:51.839 --> 34:52.840
{\an8}THE KID CAME UP TO ME,
HE'S LIKE, "YO, WHERE'S SAM?"

34:52.924 --> 34:54.425
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"
"WHERE'S SAM"?

34:54.509 --> 34:55.842
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

34:55.927 --> 34:56.677
{\an8}AND THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED
TO BE FOUND OUT.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.638
{\an8}AM I RIGHT?

34:58.721 --> 34:59.263
{\an8}THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED
TO BE FOUND OUT.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.015
{\an8}THE KID BUMPED INTO ME.

35:01.098 --> 35:02.308
{\an8}THE FIRST THING I DID
WHEN I WALKED UP TO SAM--

35:02.391 --> 35:03.684
{\an8}YOU WERE WITH SAM,
AND I HAD BUMPED INTO HER.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.521
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "YOU REALLY DIDN'T
THINK I KNEW THIS KID?"

35:06.604 --> 35:07.855
{\an8}AND THEN SHE GOES,
"[bleep] YOU,"

35:07.939 --> 35:08.606
{\an8}AND SHE WALKED BY ME
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU GUYS, MAN.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.984
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

35:12.068 --> 35:13.361
{\an8}I NEED TO KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.070
{\an8}- NO, WE'RE TALKING TO RON.

35:14.153 --> 35:16.114
{\an8}- I'M TALKING TO YOU.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.448
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

35:17.532 --> 35:19.158
{\an8}- ARE YOU TELLING RON
THAT IF I'M NOT HERE WITH RON

35:19.242 --> 35:21.202
{\an8}I'M GONNA BE WITH ARVIN?
- NO, NO, NO.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.788
{\an8}WE'RE HAVING
A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

35:23.871 --> 35:26.040
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU GETTING INVOLVED
IN MY BUSINESS?

35:26.123 --> 35:27.125
{\an8}- I'M NOT INVOLVED
IN YOUR BUSINESS.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.210
{\an8}- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW
ARVIN'S MY--

35:29.293 --> 35:31.712
{\an8}IT'S JUST SHADY.
YOU'RE BEING SHADY

35:31.796 --> 35:33.297
{\an8}WHEN YOU KNOW ARVIN'S
MY FRIEND.

35:33.381 --> 35:35.007
{\an8}- HE TOLD ME--HE SAID THAT YOU
WERE CONTACTING HIM TO CHILL.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.343
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
- NO.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.553
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.388
{\an8}- NOW YOU'RE BEING
A SCHEMER AND SCUMBAG,

35:40.471 --> 35:41.889
{\an8}AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
- I'M LOOKING OUT FOR HIM.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.224
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE YOU.
I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.183
{\an8}- I DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER.
- I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.143
{\an8}I LIKE RON.
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.770
{\an8}- I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THIS RELATIONSHIP.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.105
{\an8}- YO, YO, FIRST OF ALL
WHEN I DID SPEAK TO HIM--

35:49.188 --> 35:50.940
{\an8}- RELAX.
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.233
{\an8}- HE DIDN'T SAY
THAT YOU GUYS WERE FRIENDS.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.235
{\an8}- WHAT'D HE SAY TO YOU?
- HE SAYS, "WHERE'S SAM?"

35:54.318 --> 35:56.487
{\an8}I GO, "SHE'S WITH RON."
HE'S LIKE, "SHE'S WITH RON?

35:56.571 --> 35:57.905
{\an8}SHE TOLD ME
TO MEET HER HERE."

35:57.989 --> 35:58.948
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
TO ALL OF US.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.366
{\an8}- THAT'S A CROCK OF [bleep].

36:00.449 --> 36:01.450
{\an8}DID YOU SAY TO HIM,
"ARE YOU GUYS FRIENDS"?

36:01.534 --> 36:03.202
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO, I SAID TO HIM--
I SAID TO HIM--

36:03.286 --> 36:04.871
{\an8}- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW HIM.
- NO, NO, NO--

36:04.954 --> 36:07.206
{\an8}- YOU'RE A CROCK OF [bleep].

36:07.290 --> 36:09.000
{\an8}YOU'RE A CROCK OF [bleep]!

36:09.083 --> 36:10.084
{\an8}YOU'RE A PIECE OF [bleep].

36:10.167 --> 36:13.880
{\an8}- YOU ARE THE WORST
ARGUMENT PERSON EVER.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.132
{\an8}ALL YOU DO IS KEEP REPEATING
"YOU'RE A PIECE OF [bleep]."

36:16.215 --> 36:16.966
{\an8}I CAN'T EVEN, LIKE,
GET AN ANSWER OUT.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.384
{\an8}- YOU DON'T ANSWER ANYTHING.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.595
{\an8}- ALL YOU SAY IS,
"YOU'RE A CROCK OF [bleep]."

36:20.678 --> 36:22.138
{\an8}- YOU ARE A CROCK OF [bleep].

36:22.221 --> 36:23.431
{\an8}I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HARD

36:23.514 --> 36:27.018
{\an8}TO MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP,
LIKE, BETTER AND HAPPY.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.103
{\an8}AND MIKE'S, LIKE,
GONNA RUIN US.

36:29.186 --> 36:30.479
{\an8}WE'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.023
{\an8}- WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
IS I'M GOING TO CALL,

36:32.106 --> 36:33.608
{\an8}AND YOU CAN BE
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.694
{\an8}I WANTED HIM TO SAY EVERYTHING
HE COULD POSSIBLY SAY.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.279
{\an8}I DO NOT WANT YOU
TO JUMP IN.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.865
{\an8}EVERYBODY COULD BE THERE,
AND THEN YOU COULD DISPUTE IT.

36:40.948 --> 36:41.866
{\an8}- I LOOK AT SAM,
AND I CAN SEE IT IN HER FACE

36:41.949 --> 36:44.452
{\an8}THAT SOMETHING'S FISHY,

36:44.535 --> 36:45.912
{\an8}SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.288
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, IF I FIND OUT
THAT MORE STUFF GOES DOWN,

36:47.371 --> 36:49.999
{\an8}THAT'S WHEN I'M GONNA
[bleep] LOSE IT.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.293
{\an8}- I REALLY HAVE NOTHING
TO HIDE, RON.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.128
{\an8}- FIND THE NUMBER.
- GET ME HIS NUMBER.

36:54.211 --> 36:55.129
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M NOT
A SNEAKY PERSON.

36:55.212 --> 36:58.132
{\an8}- I'LL CALL HIM.
I'LL CALL HIM.

36:58.215 --> 36:59.967
{\an8}- HE WAS A FRIEND.
- YOU GOT THE NUMBER, MIKE?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.052
{\an8}- I CAN GET IT.

37:01.135 --> 37:01.844
{\an8}- YOU'RE A SNEAKY BITCH,
AND I'M GLAD--

37:01.928 --> 37:03.888
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

37:06.432 --> 37:08.726
{\an8}- WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS I'M GOING TO CALL,

37:08.809 --> 37:10.144
{\an8}AND EVERYBODY
COULD BE THERE.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.812
{\an8}AND THEN
YOU COULD DISPUTE IT.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.980
{\an8}- YOU'RE A PIECE OF [bleep].

37:13.064 --> 37:14.565
{\an8}- HE'S ORDERING YOU ROSES,

37:14.649 --> 37:15.983
{\an8}AND THE FIRST THING YOU DO
IS CALL ARVIN.

37:16.067 --> 37:16.984
{\an8}SMART MOVE.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.527
{\an8}- I DIDN'T GET THE ROSES
WHEN I DID THAT.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.987
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S ANOTHER THING.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.447
{\an8}WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE TO ARVIN THOUGH?

37:21.530 --> 37:22.823
{\an8}- ALL THE TIME WHEN I'M HOME.

37:22.907 --> 37:23.950
{\an8}HE'S A FRIEND.
HE'S MY B.B.M. FRIEND.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.493
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE SPOKE TO ME ABOUT.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.495
{\an8}- THAT'S JUST WEIRD.
- THAT'S SKETCHY.

37:27.578 --> 37:28.245
{\an8}- WHAT IS SKETCHY?

37:28.329 --> 37:30.539
{\an8}- IF IT WASN'T FOR MIKE,

37:30.623 --> 37:32.500
{\an8}I WOULDA NEVER KNOWN
THAT ARVIN SHOWED UP FOR YOU.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.918
{\an8}- YOU'RE A SNEAKY BITCH,
AND I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.169
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW ME!

37:35.252 --> 37:37.171
{\an8}- YOU'RE VERY SKETCHY.
YOU'RE JUST VERY SNEAKY.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.506
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN WANNA--I DON'T
EVEN WANNA TALK TO YOU.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.424
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I REALLY
DIDN'T LIKE HER THAT MUCH,

37:40.508 --> 37:44.178
{\an8}I RESPECTED HER AND THOUGHT
SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.

37:44.261 --> 37:45.554
{\an8}YOU'VE BEEN PUT ON BLAST.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.640
{\an8}NOW SHE'S A SNEAKY BITCH.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.518
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE HER,
AND I DON'T CARE.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.353
{\an8}- WE ALL KNOW WHERE
HIS INTENTIONS ARE.

37:52.436 --> 37:53.646
{\an8}I HATE MIKE.

37:53.729 --> 37:57.024
{\an8}- IF I'M WITH A GIRL
AND SHE TEXTS ANOTHER DUDE

37:57.108 --> 37:58.609
{\an8}"WHAT'S THE WEATHER
LIKE OUTSIDE?"

37:58.693 --> 38:00.528
{\an8}I STILL DON'T TRUST IT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

38:00.611 --> 38:01.529
{\an8}- EXACTLY.
- I JUST DON'T TRUST THE GIRL

38:01.612 --> 38:04.657
{\an8}TALKING TO ANOTHER DUDE,
THAT'S JUST ME.

38:04.740 --> 38:05.574
{\an8}THAT'S JUST ME.

38:05.658 --> 38:06.701
{\an8}WHAT WAS SAID,
WHAT WAS THIS,

38:06.784 --> 38:08.411
{\an8}I THINK THAT'S IRRELEVANT.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.371
{\an8}- WOULD SHE WANT YOU, RON,
TO HANG OUT WITH ANOTHER GIRL?

38:10.454 --> 38:13.082
{\an8}- AND WHY WOULD SHE TELL ALL
HER FRIENDS TO COME TO KARMA?

38:13.165 --> 38:14.208
{\an8}WE GO TO KARMA.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.668
{\an8}RONNIE, ALL HIS [bleep]
WAS OUT IN THE OPEN,

38:15.751 --> 38:17.169
{\an8}AND HE ADMITTED
TO ALL HIS [bleep].

38:17.253 --> 38:19.046
{\an8}RONNIE DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW ABOUT THIS DUDE,

38:19.130 --> 38:20.923
{\an8}AND SUPPOSEDLY THIS IS
SAMMI'S "FRIEND."

38:21.007 --> 38:22.049
{\an8}THAT'S BULL[bleep].

38:22.133 --> 38:24.218
{\an8}THE WHOLE FRIEND THING,
WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW

38:24.301 --> 38:25.344
{\an8}ABOUT THIS THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP,

38:25.428 --> 38:26.554
{\an8}THAT SHE TALKS TO THIS KID?

38:26.637 --> 38:29.849
{\an8}- TRUST NO [bleep] EVER.

38:29.932 --> 38:31.809
{\an8}- I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

38:31.892 --> 38:32.935
{\an8}- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE A VERY SWEET PERSON.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.229
{\an8}YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

38:35.312 --> 38:36.605
{\an8}- THE ONLY THING
THAT THEY CAN ARGUE

38:36.689 --> 38:37.898
{\an8}IS THAT YOU WERE
HITTING UP DUDE TO BE LIKE,

38:37.982 --> 38:39.066
{\an8}"YO, MEET ME OUT.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.360
{\an8}I'M SINGLE.
I WANNA DO ME."

38:41.444 --> 38:42.403
{\an8}BUT YOU WERE SINGLE.

38:42.486 --> 38:43.529
{\an8}LIKE ANY OTHER GIRL

38:43.612 --> 38:44.780
{\an8}HIT UP HER BEST-LOOKING DUDES

38:44.864 --> 38:46.365
{\an8}LIKE YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE SINGLE,

38:46.449 --> 38:47.992
{\an8}AND YOU BRING THEM OUT
TO THE NIGHTCLUB

38:48.075 --> 38:49.285
{\an8}THAT YOU KNOW YOUR EX
IS GONNA BE AT.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.703
{\an8}IF I KNEW TOM
WAS GONNA BE THERE,

38:50.786 --> 38:51.871
{\an8}I'D BRING [bleep]
TEN ROGERS TO THE SAME PLACE

38:51.954 --> 38:53.497
{\an8}AND [bleep] ON HIM.

38:53.581 --> 38:58.419
{\an8}- BUT OF COURSE, LIKE, MIKE
IS MIND-[bleep] HIM, OKAY?

38:58.502 --> 38:59.045
{\an8}- TOTALLY.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.672
{\an8}- MIKE IS NOT REAL.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.925
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, YO, AND
I'M GOING TO TALK ON THE PHONE

39:05.009 --> 39:06.844
{\an8}WITH THIS KID
LIKE HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.679
{\an8}SO I CAN GET [bleep]
OUT OF HIM, ALL RIGHT?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.056
{\an8}- YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
THE REAL DEAL, DOG.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.266
{\an8}- TWO DAYS AGO RON WAS SAYING

39:12.349 --> 39:13.934
{\an8}HOW MUCH HE [bleep]
HATED MIKE,

39:14.018 --> 39:15.394
{\an8}HOW HE WAS GONNA
CALL MIKE OUT.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.564
{\an8}AND NOW, LIKE,
HE'S LISTENING TO HIM.

39:18.647 --> 39:19.607
{\an8}- THAT'S HIS BOY.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.192
{\an8}- HE'S NOT YOUR BOY.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.026
{\an8}- YOU WANNA BELIEVE THE GUYS,
GO AHEAD.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.861
{\an8}I'M DONE WITH IT.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.613
{\an8}FORGET YOU, RON.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.448
{\an8}AFTER EVERYTHING, BYE.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.618
{\an8}FOR THE 40TH MILLION TIME,
I SAY I'M DONE.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.454
{\an8}LIKE, [bleep] IT, I'M DONE.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.623
{\an8}[line ringing]

39:35.706 --> 39:38.793
{\an8}- HELLO.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.503
{\an8}- ARVIN.
- WHAT'S UP, BRO?

39:40.586 --> 39:43.422
{\an8}- THERE'S A SITUATION
RIGHT NOW.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.716
{\an8}I MEAN, BETWEEN ME AND YOU,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.301
{\an8}RONNIE, HE JUST WANTS
TO KNOW THE DEAL.

39:47.384 --> 39:50.638
{\an8}HE'S LIKE, "IF THEY HOOKED UP,
THEY HOOKED UP, WHATEVER.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.140
{\an8}IT IS WHAT IT IS."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.266
{\an8}SO...

39:54.350 --> 39:56.143
{\an8}- WE WERE HANGING OUT
A LOT THE SUMMER

39:56.227 --> 39:57.853
{\an8}THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
AND ME WERE HANGING OUT.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.939
{\an8}- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
HOOKED UP LAST YEAR.

40:00.022 --> 40:01.941
{\an8}DID YOU GUYS EVER HANG OUT
IN THAT FASHION

40:02.024 --> 40:03.818
{\an8}OR IS IT ALWAYS FRIENDS?

40:03.901 --> 40:06.153
{\an8}- WE'VE ALWAYS GONE OUT
TOGETHER AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

40:06.237 --> 40:08.364
{\an8}AND, LIKE, WE MADE OUT.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.865
{\an8}- MADE OUT HERE AND THERE.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.325
{\an8}- THERE'S ALWAYS
BEEN SOMETHING THERE.

40:11.408 --> 40:14.078
{\an8}AND SHE HITS ME UP
FROM TIME TO TIME.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.287
{\an8}- SHE HITS YOU UP
FROM TIME TO TIME.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.622
{\an8}- YO, DUDE.
- WHAT UP?

40:16.705 --> 40:17.957
{\an8}- OKAY, HAVE YOU EVER
HOOKED UP WITH SAM?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.166
{\an8}- NAH, NOT LIKE THAT.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.585
{\an8}- YOU NEVER MADE OUT
WITH SAM?

40:21.669 --> 40:22.086
{\an8}- YEAH, WE HAVE.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.296
{\an8}- [bleep] THIS.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.339
{\an8}- WAIT, MAN, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
- [bleep] THIS BITCH.

40:25.422 --> 40:28.634
{\an8}I'M DONE WITH HER
[bleep, bleep].

40:28.717 --> 40:32.054
{\an8}[bleep] BIGGEST LIAR I EVER
MET IN MY LIFE.
