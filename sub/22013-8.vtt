WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.688
-Previously on Empire...
-I may lose Bella because

00:20.721 --> 00:22.090
-you were too weak to fight
for her. -That's not fair.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.591
I deserve better.
So when

00:23.624 --> 00:25.826
you start looking for me, don't.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.396
I planted that gun to make
the shoot look justified.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.830
Now you know something about me

00:29.863 --> 00:31.332
that could put me in a cell

00:31.365 --> 00:32.400
for the rest of my life.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.434
I think it's time.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.435
Time for what?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.404
Time for you to meet my family.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.607
This is Simon Lambert.
He's a medicating psychiatrist.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.375
No matter what happens
from here on out,

00:41.409 --> 00:43.077
I need you to know
that this is real.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.113
-I love you.
-Wait, Warren, why are you here?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.515
His job was to make you
fall in love with him.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.616
Jamal, listen to me,
I was just...

00:48.649 --> 00:49.783
-You bitch!
-(grunting)

00:52.720 --> 00:55.956
Yeah, a'ight, my love.
Thank you very much, a'ight.

00:55.989 --> 00:59.059
So, we have assault.
Battery.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.095
Disturbing the peace.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.430
Destruction of private property.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.098
And fleeing the scene
of the crime.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.900
Oh, he didn't flee the scene
of no crime.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.469
He just stomped a traitor's ass

01:08.502 --> 01:09.570
and then stepped over
the remnants.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.904
Ain't that right, boo?

01:10.938 --> 01:13.874
THIRSTY: Yeah. (chuckles)
I agree. But, uh,

01:13.907 --> 01:15.276
there's a warrant out
for Jamal's arrest.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.810
Now, I got them
to agree to let him

01:16.844 --> 01:18.579
turn himself in tonight.
That gives us about...

01:18.612 --> 01:20.881
ten hours to make
all this go bye-bye.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.252
How are we gonna
make that happen?

01:24.285 --> 01:25.953
We, uh, we-we find Warren.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.388
Get him to say he threw
the first punch, not Jamal.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.457
That way, at least
three of the charges

01:29.490 --> 01:30.958
go away, and I can
ghost the rest.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.294
But. I hear a "but."
Spit it out.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.095
No, it's not a "but."
It's a Diana Dubois.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.930
She's got her nephew on lock.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.999
Now, we know this family
loves to play hide-and-seek.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.968
They hide, we seek.
And he can be anywhere.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.470
Yeah, well, I'll find him.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.338
And I'm-a finish
what you started,

01:44.372 --> 01:45.739
'cause anybody
that knows me knows

01:45.773 --> 01:47.175
I will kill a bitch

01:47.208 --> 01:49.410
even if she
breathes on you wrong.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.978
-You know that.
-I know. We good.

01:51.011 --> 01:53.147
Okay, I'm-I'm-a make you
something to eat.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.482
You look a little flush.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.353
LUCIOUS:
Well, thank you, Thirst.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.622
(elevator bell dings)

02:04.057 --> 02:06.460
-What's up, Dad?
-Hey, fellas.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.797
Sit down.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.199
What...

02:11.232 --> 02:12.466
So y'all just...

02:12.500 --> 02:14.435
What is this?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.103
-Ma.
-What?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.272
Yo, can y'all just, like,
please stop all of this?

02:18.306 --> 02:20.140
Mom, I know what you're doing
over there.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.975
What, boy? I'm looking
for something for you to eat.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.544
No, there's no pills
in the cereal,

02:23.577 --> 02:25.313
-there's no booze in the cabinet
-Better not be.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.014
or nothing. If ya'll think
somehow I'm, I'm-a

02:27.047 --> 02:29.116
fall off the wagon or jump off
some damn balcony,

02:29.149 --> 02:30.117
then you're wrong.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.552
So the whole intervention stuff

02:31.585 --> 02:32.986
can stop right now.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.455
Wait, this is what
this is about?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.623
I'm out of here.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.724
-Uh-uh.
-LUCIOUS: Sit back down.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.159
When a family is in crisis,

02:39.193 --> 02:41.495
they come together.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.799
ANDRE:
What's this all about?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.701
This is about...

02:47.735 --> 02:48.936
you, Andre.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.173
(short chuckle)
Me?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.909
Yes, we know what that bitch
Diana Dubois is up to.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
She trying to get to my babies

02:57.611 --> 02:58.912
one by one,

02:58.946 --> 03:01.249
and you are next, Dre.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.053
*

03:12.960 --> 03:15.028
(Warren groans)

03:15.062 --> 03:18.232
Oh. Morning, Glory.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.534
(laughs)
I got to say

03:20.568 --> 03:22.436
I always thought that Jamal Lyon

03:22.470 --> 03:25.406
had it in him
to do you like that.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.909
But what I underestimated was
your weak ass not fighting back.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.944
It hurts, don't it?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.046
Where am I?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.082
Don't you sweat.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.518
You're safe.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.588
Mother had Dr. Mella
prescribe you some goodies.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.123
Made sure you stayed sleepy.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.259
Apparently they're working.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.063
Did all that hurt?

03:50.097 --> 03:52.566
-What about Jamal?
-(chuckles): Well...

03:52.600 --> 03:54.067
he's in jail, probably.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.569
Or he will be soon enough.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.071
Well, I got to get out of here.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.973
Things to do, people to see.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.575
Mother wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.311
I'll tell her

04:03.344 --> 04:06.079
that you are in good spirits.

04:06.113 --> 04:09.082
Sven's here to make sure
you're all safe and sound,

04:09.116 --> 04:11.719
just in case
the Lyons come over

04:11.752 --> 04:13.821
and try and kill you.
So, uh,

04:13.854 --> 04:15.389
I'll see you around, clown.

04:15.423 --> 04:19.159
-She ruined me.
-She ruined you?

04:19.192 --> 04:21.228
No, no, no, no, no.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.063
You ruined you.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.498
You played yourself.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.099
But no worries.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.769
Mother wouldn't
be the Diana Dubois she is

04:28.802 --> 04:31.405
if she didn't
stand by her word, so...

04:31.439 --> 04:33.307
we'll take care of your father.
And who knows--

04:33.341 --> 04:35.676
maybe after
all is said and done,

04:35.709 --> 04:38.446
you can go back to California.
Start your life back up again.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.081
See, I told you.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.784
I told you what would happen
if you fell for a Lyon.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.420
And now here you are.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.656
Okay.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.291
Sven.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.764
So is there anything different
going on in your life--

04:56.797 --> 05:00.267
-something strange, anything,
uh, suspicious. -I don't know

05:00.300 --> 05:02.536
what you want me to say, Ma,
okay? You can make

05:02.570 --> 05:05.105
these two go over their stories
all day, nothing like that's

05:05.138 --> 05:07.007
happened to me. I don't have
a baby to snatch, I don't have

05:07.040 --> 05:08.776
-a boyfriend to beat in
public... -Why you got to say

05:08.809 --> 05:10.544
-stuff like that? -Yo, why would
you say that? -Okay, all right,

05:10.578 --> 05:11.879
-j-just...
-I'm sorry, I'm-I'm sorry, okay?

05:11.912 --> 05:14.648
Look, I'm not unsympathetic.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.617
I'm just saying that
there's no pattern here, okay?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.519
I-I don't see how Diana
can get to me.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.054
Well, have you met anyone new
that you ain't told us about?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.491
I meet new people all the...

05:23.524 --> 05:25.826
Look, I got a new tailor, okay?
There's a new barista...

05:25.859 --> 05:27.861
Don't get smart, boy--
I beat your ass.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.229
You know your mom's
not talking about that.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.700
This woman--
she does have a pattern,

05:32.733 --> 05:34.835
because she tries
to go to your heart

05:34.868 --> 05:37.304
and bypass your brain.
Now, think.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.641
Has anyone tried to come at you
through your heart?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.209
COOKIE:
Listen to your father, boy.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.845
He actually...
is making sense.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.881
There's no one like that.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.850
Yeah, I don't know how many
times I can say it.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.985
But you did say
there was a new girl.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.221
-Yes. -That was nothing, Pop.
It was nothing.

05:54.254 --> 05:57.057
I don't know how many times
I need to hear it. Yo, I'm out.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.826
You gonna learn the hard way.
And don't be hitting people

05:58.859 --> 06:01.061
-in the street like Jamal did.
-Yo, straight up, you could

06:01.094 --> 06:02.930
-take your little bitch ass to
Cuba right now. -Hey, you sit

06:02.963 --> 06:06.366
your little narrow ass down.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.536
Ain't nobody finish.
I'm not done here.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.771
-Well, I am done.
-I'm not. -Yeah, well,

06:10.804 --> 06:13.106
look, I'm fine, okay?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.242
Ma, Pop,
I'm perfectly fine, okay?

06:15.275 --> 06:17.411
And it's clear that Jamal
wants to be left alone.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.246
-What? -I'm going back to work.
-You going to Empire?

06:19.279 --> 06:20.280
Yes, sir.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.615
COOKIE:
Oh, that's great.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.885
Three stupid, dumb-ass,
blind mice.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.287
Sorry about Warren, Jamal.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.791
JAMAL: You still watch
your back, though.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.626
So...

06:32.660 --> 06:35.429
should I catch
the elevator for y'all?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.566
LUCIOUS:
Come on.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.267
Let's give him some peace.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.272
You better be glad
I got an important text.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.607
You don't put your mother out.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.576
Thank you.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.751
-I think it's time.
-No, no, no, no.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.921
You got six more weeks. We just
got to get you to a doctor.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.456
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.157
-I just can't tell
her father yet. -Shh.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.393
-(groans) -Mm-mmm, mm-mmm.
Come on, come on, come on.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.062
Just keep walking.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.931
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.966
I'm gonna need you to stop
saying "father," okay?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.968
I know it's Burleson.

07:17.471 --> 07:21.809
Look, I am scared out of
my mind, all right?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.511
And you had three of these,

07:23.544 --> 07:26.013
so I just need to know
that it's gonna be okay.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.481
(sighs)

07:27.515 --> 07:29.282
-(exhales) -Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh. Come on.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.484
Oh...

07:30.518 --> 07:33.621
Here.
Look at this.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.424
That's my firstborn.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.593
He was born 15 years ago.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.094
I'm still scared, girl.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.263
(laughs)
Look,

07:43.296 --> 07:44.932
ain't nothing in this world

07:44.965 --> 07:47.300
gonna bring you more joy
and more pain

07:47.334 --> 07:49.937
than having a child.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.541
Well, damn, Cookie, you for
a whole bunch of pep talk.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.376
-Oh. Oh!
-Shh, shh.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.145
-(panting)
-C.O.!

07:58.178 --> 08:00.914
-C.O.!
-It hurts.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.958
-(laughing)
-Ooh!

08:10.991 --> 08:13.193
-It's a girl.
-(all cooing)

08:13.226 --> 08:15.062
Hush. Now, this a favor.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.832
You get caught, and it's my ass.
Ten minutes.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.401
Oh...

08:21.434 --> 08:24.371
Oh, look at that little peanut.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.907
Oh, she just as cute
as a little button.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.475
She's so pretty.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.244
Oh. You talk to your sister?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.346
Yeah. She gonna take her.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.416
You know, until I get out, which
is gonna be a couple of years.

08:36.449 --> 08:40.053
She won't have to know
about nothing-- not this place

08:40.087 --> 08:42.222
-or her father.
-COOKIE: Yeah, that's right.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.491
(sighs)

08:44.524 --> 08:46.660
What?

08:46.694 --> 08:48.495
-What?
-(crying): I'm sorry...

08:48.528 --> 08:51.431
COOKIE:
Oh...

08:51.464 --> 08:53.667
I don't know
if I can give her up.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.069
-Oh. -Oh, I know.
-Cookie, this feeling.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.005
I feel like

08:58.038 --> 09:00.240
-I would do anything for you.
-Mm-hmm.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.509
-I feel like
I would kill for her. -Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.678
You know?
Like, if anybody laid

09:04.712 --> 09:08.248
a hand on her beautiful,
precious head...

09:08.281 --> 09:09.449
-Yeah. -No, that's right.
-COOKIE: know that feeling.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.584
-Anyone. -Yes.
-I know that.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.619
Isn't this crazy?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.353
Oh, look at her.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.755
Thank y'all.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.423
Oh, there...

09:16.456 --> 09:19.292
COOKIE:
Mmm, little precious. Yes...

09:31.104 --> 09:32.906
I don't why
you so ready to leave.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.608
You know that bitch Diana
ain't done with us.

09:34.642 --> 09:35.943
-I know that.
-Okay, well,

09:35.976 --> 09:37.945
if you know that, know this:
Don't...

09:37.978 --> 09:41.481
I-I don't need
the-the kumbaya Dwight, okay?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.652
I need my fighter Lucious back.
And if you're not in there,

09:44.685 --> 09:46.453
then go paint a symphony
somewhere.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.455
Let me avenge this family.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.958
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
why would you say that to me?

09:50.991 --> 09:53.326
Don't you see I'm doing
everything in my power

09:53.360 --> 09:55.796
to be the man that you
need me to be right now?

09:55.829 --> 09:58.766
You may not see it clearly, but
I swear to you, Lucious is here,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.735
watching over you,
watching over our family.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.838
And what I do see is Andre
is not being honest with us.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.807
He's keeping something from us.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.976
And until we can figure out
what that is, we can't help him

10:09.009 --> 10:10.678
or the rest of our family.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.413
Okay, well, is there a solution
in this speech, Spartacus?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.816
Divide and conquer.
You take care of Jamal.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.951
He's not out of the woods yet,
but you got him.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.953
Let me take care of Andre
and this Dubois stuff.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.221
You better.

10:22.723 --> 10:23.957
(scoffs)

10:30.130 --> 10:32.332
DIANA: So, the next thing you
need you need to do is schedule

10:32.365 --> 10:34.201
my photo shoot
for the Captain's Ball promo.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.936
You need to schedule
two appointments--

10:35.969 --> 10:38.005
one for each of your faces.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.973
I suggest that you stay back.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.176
(scoffs)

10:43.210 --> 10:45.378
I'm just here to return a gift

10:45.412 --> 10:47.514
your family gave to my family.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.316
Knowing your penchant
for street justice,

10:49.349 --> 10:50.718
these gentlemen are prepared

10:50.751 --> 10:53.486
to haul you off to jail
or throw you in traffic.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.322
Now, how big a scene
do you wish to make?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.390
Well, you didn't need
all this manpower, child.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.626
I just wanted to return this.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.729
Angelo said it belonged
to his grandmother,

11:01.762 --> 11:04.664
so I was supposed to send it
back, but I guess I forgot.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.434
And I know how important
family is to you, so...

11:09.903 --> 11:12.539
Throw your men out in the street
for that, bitch.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.540
Move!

11:13.573 --> 11:14.908
Get that ring. Now.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.609
-Oh...
-(honking)

11:18.712 --> 11:20.413
(driver screams)

11:20.447 --> 11:21.715
Oh.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.550
(horns honking)

11:25.518 --> 11:26.854
-(horn honking)
-Got it.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.992
Ooh, it took everything inside
of me not to whoop her ass.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.994
-I hope you got the pictures.
-Hell, yeah, I got the shots.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.697
I got the shot.
I'll get back to you. Okay.

11:37.731 --> 11:41.068
Get a dog? Good looking out.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.004
Hey, split the difference
on that kick.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.007
Turn her up two DB. All right.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.942
*

11:51.111 --> 11:52.412
* I ain't shy-y-y-y *

11:52.445 --> 11:53.680
Perfect.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.716
* Move it double ti-i-i-ime *

11:56.750 --> 11:59.686
* You tryin' hold me
ti-i-i-ight *

11:59.719 --> 12:01.288
* But I'm-a fly high *

12:01.321 --> 12:03.190
* Like Superman,
you heard right *

12:03.223 --> 12:04.524
* Let me rock, babe

12:04.557 --> 12:06.059
* You can't make me stop, babe *

12:06.093 --> 12:08.295
* Fire like a bang bang

12:08.328 --> 12:10.063
* Ho

12:10.097 --> 12:11.231
* Let me rock, babe

12:11.264 --> 12:12.766
* You go do your own thing

12:12.800 --> 12:14.367
* Don't worry 'bout nothing *

12:14.401 --> 12:16.036
* Ho

12:16.069 --> 12:17.704
* Let me rock, babe

12:17.737 --> 12:19.039
* Time to pump the brakes,
babe *

12:19.072 --> 12:21.141
* Ain't nobody's baby *

12:21.174 --> 12:22.642
* Ho

12:22.675 --> 12:23.944
* Let me rock, babe

12:23.977 --> 12:25.578
* You can't make me stop,
babe *

12:25.612 --> 12:27.147
* Fire like a bang bang

12:27.180 --> 12:29.883
* Ho

12:29.917 --> 12:32.786
* Let me ro-o-o-o-ock

12:32.820 --> 12:36.589
* Let me
ro-o-o-o-o-ock *

12:36.623 --> 12:38.258
* Let me ro-o-o-o-o-ock

12:38.291 --> 12:41.328
* Let me rock, rock,
rock, rock, rock *

12:41.361 --> 12:43.296
* Trying to hold me

12:43.330 --> 12:45.598
* Do-o-o-own

12:45.632 --> 12:47.500
What's all this about?
Why she with you?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.136
This my man Caliban's beat.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.737
Tiana in here throwing
some flame to it.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.272
It's dope, right?

12:52.305 --> 12:54.607
What's that got to do with me?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.146
(Shine sighs)

12:59.179 --> 13:01.148
I got five albums to do
for 20 For 20.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.983
I got a Empire artist
on each one.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.852
-I want you to do one, too.
-(laughs)

13:04.885 --> 13:07.154
And I figured your girl
could help

13:07.187 --> 13:09.022
-talk you into it.
-Number one, she ain't my girl.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.024
Number two,

13:11.058 --> 13:14.161
I got better things to do than
lay hooks for off-brand rappers.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.464
And number three,

13:17.497 --> 13:20.200
you should put some Auto-Tune
on all that mess.

13:23.370 --> 13:27.540
I am so sick and tired of your
spoiled and entitled ass!

13:27.574 --> 13:29.642
You know what,
you should go be back

13:29.676 --> 13:32.079
with your baby mama
with your clown ass.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.949
You see what she did?

13:35.983 --> 13:38.251
-Well, I heard what you said.
Uh... -(door slams)

13:39.686 --> 13:41.989
Forget her, man!

13:42.022 --> 13:43.656
Screw you!

13:43.690 --> 13:45.725
I ain't never gonna be
with anybody.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.594
This life ruins everything.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.830
(sighs)

13:50.864 --> 13:52.332
Hakeem, listen, man.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.504
I'm not your father.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.909
But it seems like you need
some guidance

14:01.942 --> 14:04.711
on how to handle all this.
I'll tell you what,

14:04.744 --> 14:06.947
come take a ride with me.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.718
Come on.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.756
What's all this?

14:16.789 --> 14:18.591
Uh, this is the little project
for Cookie.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.193
You know, with the whole
Jamal situation.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.528
Come to find out

14:21.561 --> 14:23.196
I got a friend
in the security company

14:23.230 --> 14:25.065
that Diana employs.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.867
Now, they tell me she has
five guards assigned to her.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.370
These four,
they with her all day.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.172
See?

14:32.205 --> 14:33.506
So I looked for the fifth man,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.543
who's MIA... this dude.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.212
Sven Svarsqaard-- Smorgasbord--

14:39.246 --> 14:41.081
I mean, you know,
something N-Norwegian.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.184
Whatever. He's on the clock,
but he's not with Diana.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.518
He's with Warren.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.354
Bingo. So, I, you know...

14:47.387 --> 14:49.289
get the dispatcher to give me
his location:

14:49.322 --> 14:50.924
a hotel in Midtown.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.293
Nice work.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.396
-I aim to please.
-So you going?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.198
Well, that's what I suggested,
but you know Cookie.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.633
"I don't need your help,
Thirsty. I did 17 years."

15:00.667 --> 15:02.469
-So I got to get her the
address now. -Okay, good.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.137
Well, when you're done,
I've got something

15:04.171 --> 15:05.405
I need you to do for me.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.074
Say the word.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.944
(siren wails in distance)

15:12.279 --> 15:13.880
Are you working
for Diana Dubois?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.649
-Who? -Did she pay you
to get close to me?

15:16.683 --> 15:19.252
Maybe give you an extra bonus
for tearing my heart out

15:19.286 --> 15:20.787
like-like Warren did Jamal?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.755
-Like Anika did Hakeem?
-PAMELA: Sit down.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.925
People are beginning to stare.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.667
Now, what are you
going on about?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.669
Someone's after my family.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.438
Someone's always after
your family.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.307
Yeah, but this is different.
This is different, okay?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.775
The Dubois are coming at me
and my brothers one by one,

15:42.809 --> 15:44.611
through people pretending
to care about us.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.448
Who worm their way in under
our defenses, who get inside.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.651
People who make us want 'em,
people who make us need 'em.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.120
And that's supposed to be me?

15:53.153 --> 15:55.355
-You tell me.
-Okay, Andre.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.757
Tell me,

15:57.790 --> 16:01.161
was I also supposed to open
my heart up to you?

16:01.194 --> 16:05.132
Tell you the most sickening,
damning things about myself

16:05.165 --> 16:08.201
that could send me to prison,
so I could trap you?

16:16.143 --> 16:18.278
You better leave
the detective work to me,

16:18.311 --> 16:19.712
'cause you suck at it.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.554
I really thought
we had something.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.857
We do have something, okay?
We do have something.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.959
-Pamela, please. I'm sorry.
-Andre. Get off of me.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.462
Come on, I'm sorry.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.531
Come on, Pamela, I-I'm sorry!

16:38.565 --> 16:39.566
I'm sorry!

16:39.599 --> 16:40.600
Damn it!

16:46.005 --> 16:48.641
-I'm sorry.
-(phone buttons beeping)

16:48.675 --> 16:50.577
I'm sorry.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.579
Yeah, Lucious. Meet me over here
in Bryant Park.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.382
I got Andre over here. Yeah.
Yeah, something's up.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.789
*

17:08.428 --> 17:10.097
THIRSTY:
Right over here.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.901
Pop?

17:14.934 --> 17:17.237
What are you...?

17:17.270 --> 17:19.272
Uh, how-how'd you know
I was here?

17:19.306 --> 17:20.507
You mind if I sit down?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.209
Please.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.513
Son, is everything okay?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.282
With me?

17:29.316 --> 17:31.918
Yeah, I'm... (laughs) Of course.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.886
I'm just, I'm-I'm having
a-a coffee before I...

17:33.920 --> 17:35.722
THIRSTY:
Don't do that, boss man.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.124
I saw you. Hell, the whole place
saw you flippin' out.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.592
Why don't you mind your
business, Thirsty?

17:39.626 --> 17:43.563
LUCIOUS: Thirsty told me that
you were yelling at someone.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.239
I'm seeing someone.

17:52.272 --> 17:55.074
Kind, understanding,

17:55.108 --> 17:57.777
and beautiful... a woman.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.247
Her name is Pamela Rose.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.783
-Why didn't you just tell us
about her? -'Cause she's a cop.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.453
You don't have to worry, though.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.322
It's over.
You know why?

18:09.356 --> 18:12.492
Because I just accused her

18:12.525 --> 18:14.594
of being some kind
of double agent

18:14.627 --> 18:17.630
who somehow finds the time
to moonlight for Diana Dubois.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.467
You know, as wrong as we were
for each other,

18:20.500 --> 18:23.002
I was gonna bring her
to meet you.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.806
Because she meant
that much to me.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.078
I-I didn't think
I-I could feel that again,

18:32.111 --> 18:36.115
you know, after...
after Rhonda.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.821
(sighs)

18:43.022 --> 18:44.657
See y'all later.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.160
Andre!

18:52.499 --> 18:55.034
I wanna find out everything
there is to know

18:55.067 --> 18:57.837
-about this Detective Pamela...
-Pamela Rose.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.207
I'm on it.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.376
* Oh, yeah

19:03.410 --> 19:07.680
* And you must be the plug

19:11.518 --> 19:15.355
* 'Cause I can't get enough *

19:15.388 --> 19:16.989
* Oh, no

19:17.023 --> 19:18.725
WARREN:
* I can't get enough, man *

19:18.758 --> 19:20.059
-JAMAL (on tape): Ugh. -WARREN
(on tape): Enough of you.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.728
JAMAL:
Don't ever say that again.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.396
WARREN:
I can't get enough.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.865
JAMAL: Don't ever say it again.
You sound like a damn creep.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.203
(panting)

19:55.027 --> 19:57.830
* Man

19:57.864 --> 20:00.233
* Too broke to pay attention

20:00.267 --> 20:03.236
* Main man, yeah

20:03.270 --> 20:06.239
-* Man listen, man listen
-* Shh

20:06.273 --> 20:07.840
-* All I got is this ambition
-* That's it *

20:07.874 --> 20:10.009
HAKEEM:
Why the hell we out here?

20:10.042 --> 20:12.044
SHINE: Come on, man,
relax, youngbo. We're here.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.213
* They dropped the ball
and so I ran with it *

20:14.247 --> 20:16.249
* I'm like-
man listen, man listen *

20:16.283 --> 20:17.550
Oh. What's up, man?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.552
Daddy!

20:19.586 --> 20:21.954
Hey, hey!

20:21.988 --> 20:24.357
What's up, man?
Come here. Come here.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.394
Hey. Oh. Get 'em.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.928
Let's get 'em.
What's wrong?

20:28.961 --> 20:31.030
Oh, you want the ball?
Oh, come here.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.799
Look, I got a surprise for you.
Come on.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.535
* Inside, you still hear
the engine, like "wren, wren" *

20:35.568 --> 20:37.537
Yeah, look.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.971
Look at that.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.541
Ball.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.310
Hey. Look what I got.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.911
Everybody get one.
(grunts)

20:44.944 --> 20:46.713
Everybody get one, look.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.214
Wow.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.082
(sighs) Hakeem,

20:50.116 --> 20:52.251
-this is my family.
-Damn, man, you got busy.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.621
(laughs) Yeah,
those are their mothers.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.789
At least two of 'em.
The other one's in California

20:56.823 --> 20:58.291
-visiting her pops.
-(child crying)

20:58.325 --> 21:00.059
Aw, come here.
Let me-- come here.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.461
Come here, come here,
come here.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.496
It's all good.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.998
-(Hakeem laughs)
-All good. All good. Look.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.667
-Look who's here.
-Man,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.302
-what are you,
Muslim or something? -Nah.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.604
I got three sets of kids
with three different women.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.273
But absolutely no drama.
Remember that last sentence,

21:14.307 --> 21:15.575
'cause it's almost unheard of.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.177
Go play.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.146
Man, I didn't even know
you had kids.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.482
Exactly.
Don't got people out here

21:22.515 --> 21:24.283
putting my business
in the street.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.086
So you 21, chances are
you not done having

21:27.119 --> 21:29.322
a few of these yourself.
(laughs)

21:29.356 --> 21:31.558
But you can be done
with the drama.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.694
You know the difference
between them

21:34.727 --> 21:36.363
and the girls you mess with?

21:36.396 --> 21:39.298
-What?
-For one,

21:39.332 --> 21:40.933
I don't mess where I eat.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.470
None of my exes are involved
in the music industry,

21:43.503 --> 21:45.271
or any other business
I'm involved in.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.273
But the connection
me and Tiana got...

21:47.306 --> 21:48.775
I never found before.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.711
Connections fail.
Relationships die,

21:51.744 --> 21:53.680
except the ones by blood.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.182
Which brings me
to my second point.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.652
Never let nobody get between you
and your kid, Hakeem. Nobody.

21:59.686 --> 22:03.456
No lawyer, no baby mama,
no drama.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.658
Your babies come first,
your family follows.

22:05.692 --> 22:09.028
You tattoo that on the inside
of your eyelids, Hakeem,

22:09.061 --> 22:11.030
then you can see it
how I see it.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.900
* Man listen, all I got

22:13.933 --> 22:15.334
-* Is this ambition
-* Ya dig?

22:15.368 --> 22:17.303
-My man. -* A couple million
make you stand different *

22:17.336 --> 22:19.506
All right, who wants pizza?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.977
-* -JAMAL (on recording):
* I don't know. *

22:25.011 --> 22:27.380
WARREN:
I can't get enough, baby.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.682
-JAMAL: Ugh. (laughs)
-WARREN: Enough of you.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.518
-JAMAL: Don't ever say that
again. -I can't get enough.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.920
JAMAL: Don't ever say it again.
You sound like a damn creep.

22:33.953 --> 22:37.424
WARREN:
Oh, you don't like my moves?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.158
What? I put
a little Luther Vandross,

22:39.191 --> 22:41.327
a little Barry White in there.
What's wrong with that?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.895
-No, no.
-What?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.397
They-they liked it
even if you didn't.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.832
JAMAL: Luther and Barry
would be clowning

22:45.865 --> 22:48.535
your corny ass
way from up there.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.369
You've wounded me to the core.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.342
I love you.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.911
I love you more.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.414
(sighs on tape)

23:02.715 --> 23:04.917
WARREN:
Mmm.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.219
(kissing sounds)

23:15.127 --> 23:17.296
-JAMAL: We're still recording.
-WARREN: I know, but...

23:17.329 --> 23:19.499
JAMAL: No! That's how
people get in trouble.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.492
(door opens)

23:45.525 --> 23:48.895
Yeah, Sven is gonna take
a nice long walk,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.998
so that you and I can have
a nice talk.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.502
Or not so nice. You choose.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.110
What you gonna do is
you gonna go in that precinct,

24:04.143 --> 24:06.513
and you gonna tell
the boys in blue that you threw

24:06.546 --> 24:08.615
-the first punch.
-Okay, I'll do it.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.116
Now, come on, I'm not stupid.

24:10.149 --> 24:13.019
You didn't make your mind up
that fast.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.153
You got my word, Cookie.
I'll do it.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.488
Like my son had your word

24:15.522 --> 24:16.689
when you told him you loved him?

24:16.723 --> 24:18.658
Listen,

24:18.691 --> 24:20.493
I'm not expecting you
to understand.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.995
Jamal was the love of my life.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.533
And I lost him, so look,

24:26.566 --> 24:28.467
clearing his name is the least
I can do.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.205
Smart.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.675
-Can you do me a favor, though?
-Oh, no, no, no.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.544
No, no. See,
you're not in a position

24:37.577 --> 24:39.979
to be asking for favors.
Are you stupid?

24:40.012 --> 24:41.480
Just tell Jamal I'm sorry.

24:41.514 --> 24:44.283
Uh, now I'm starting
to feel sorry for you,

24:44.316 --> 24:46.653
because, see, I didn't come here
to transfer messages

24:46.686 --> 24:48.054
between you and Jamal.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.856
I came here for answers.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.358
-So what do you want to know?
-I need to know

24:52.391 --> 24:54.661
about your aunt.
I need to know what she's up to.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.162
'Cause she got all
her family members

24:56.195 --> 24:57.697
coming after me and my boys.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.299
So I need to know
what she has in store for Andre,

25:00.332 --> 25:02.869
and you're gonna tell me.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.404
All right. I'll tell you.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.977
Anika! I know you in there.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.845
I can see the light on
from the street.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.180
Let me see Bella!

25:14.213 --> 25:16.616
Let's work this out!

25:19.251 --> 25:22.388
Anika isn't here,

25:22.421 --> 25:23.923
-and neither is Bella.
-When they coming back?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.324
I don't know.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.260
She's at her boyfriend Angelo's.
I'm sorry.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.705
(sighs)

25:38.738 --> 25:40.506
ANDRE:
She compromised

25:40.539 --> 25:41.908
my therapist?

25:41.941 --> 25:43.676
I-I don't understand.
Dr. Lambert--

25:43.710 --> 25:45.712
he-he's one of the leading
psychiatrists in New York.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.279
Why would he do that to me?

25:47.313 --> 25:50.316
Warren says she's got something
on that doctor.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.554
(sighs) When he first
prescribed these to me,

25:55.588 --> 25:59.191
I-I felt, um...

25:59.225 --> 26:00.860
not up
to my full potential and...

26:00.893 --> 26:02.528
Let me see these.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.930
(Cookie laughs softly)

26:03.963 --> 26:05.732
Yeah, see,
he was messing with your meds

26:05.765 --> 26:08.534
so he could mess with your mind,
so you could tell him things.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.937
LUCIOUS:
Now remember. Did you

26:10.970 --> 26:14.373
say anything that might
compromise the family?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.942
(sighs)

26:15.975 --> 26:17.977
-You see what that bitch did
to Hakeem. -No.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.712
I... I mean, I....

26:19.746 --> 26:20.980
He asked questions.
He's a therapist.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.548
Like what?

26:22.581 --> 26:24.784
(sighs)
Look, I just...

26:24.817 --> 26:28.387
I told him
that I couldn't perform.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.922
-Couldn't perform what?
-Sexually, Ma.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.958
Oh.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.426
The work was stressful,
and that's-that's it, I think.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.763
-That-That's it.
-COOKIE: All right. Who knows

26:36.796 --> 26:38.297
what you told him?

26:38.330 --> 26:41.433
He had you doped up
like a racehorse.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.637
Just let me and your father deal
with that shrink.

26:44.671 --> 26:49.408
But Andre, you need
to get a new doctor ASAP,

26:49.441 --> 26:52.679
so you can get your meds
recalibrated, okay?

26:52.712 --> 26:54.213
Please?

26:59.719 --> 27:02.621
-Don't play with this stuff.
-Okay, okay.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.992
I'm so glad
you're better, though.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.994
-Tomorrow, okay?
-Okay, okay.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.495
-Promise me.
-I promise.

27:09.528 --> 27:11.430
I promise. I promise.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.933
(sighs)
Well, I-I got to go.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.435
Uh, I got to apologize
to Pamela. You know,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.137
-she deserves better from me.
-Well, I don't know

27:18.170 --> 27:20.139
-about all of that
if she's a cop. -No, don't.

27:20.172 --> 27:22.875
-I'd rather you date another
white girl. -Oh, Ma, come on.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.677
Don't listen to anything
this crazy woman is saying.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.146
-I'm sure she's lovely. We'd
love to meet her. -Thank you.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.981
You know, if you guys
hadn't done this for me,

27:29.015 --> 27:30.950
-I probably w... I might have...
-COOKIE: Hey.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.719
Tomorrow, Andre.

27:32.752 --> 27:36.055
Yes, ma'am.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.525
Thank you.

27:39.558 --> 27:42.561
(indistinct chatter)

27:42.594 --> 27:45.331
-Hey, look...
-Hey.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.233
Uh, where's Poundcake?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.535
You ain't heard?
They threw her in the hole.

27:49.568 --> 27:53.005
For what? What about the baby?

27:53.039 --> 27:55.842
Haven't heard anything.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.345
I'll be back.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.348
-What'd you do to Poundcake?
Huh? -You must have me mistaken.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.384
I'm not some Joe Familiar you
just come out of the mouth to.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.753
-I got a right to know.
-And I got a right

28:06.786 --> 28:08.120
to throw you in the hole,
you don't shut up.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.725
Look, I know that's your baby.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.595
-(Burleson grunts, Cookie
whimpers) -Oh, what the hell?

28:16.628 --> 28:18.097
(prisoners clamoring, groaning)

28:18.130 --> 28:19.665
-Tough bitch!
-BURLESON: Everybody, quiet!

28:19.698 --> 28:21.000
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

28:21.033 --> 28:23.535
Say something else, I dare ya.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.641
Let's go.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.748
Come on, get in.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.052
Oh, Poundcake.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.921
(Poundcake inhales sharply)

28:41.954 --> 28:44.256
I'm sorry.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.702
Damn.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.437
They had you in there
a whole month.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.406
They only had me in for a week.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.241
What they do to you in there?

29:02.274 --> 29:04.243
Where's your baby?

29:12.451 --> 29:14.153
Okay.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.289
Come on, talk to me.

29:17.323 --> 29:21.160
What did Burleson do
to you in there? Tell me.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.963
He forced me
to sign over my rights.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.333
(crying):
My baby's in the system now.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.535
COOKIE:
Damn.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.271
(crying):
Damn.

29:32.304 --> 29:36.175
I hate this place, man!

29:36.208 --> 29:39.611
They take everything you love,
and they leave you with nothing!

29:43.449 --> 29:48.787
My word on everything,
we gonna take his ass down.

29:48.821 --> 29:52.624
I promise you that.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.861
(crying)

29:54.894 --> 29:57.263
(panting)

29:57.296 --> 29:59.631
(whimpers)

30:06.205 --> 30:08.640
* Every day,
what did you do to me? *

30:08.674 --> 30:10.977
-(door opens)
-* Because love

30:11.010 --> 30:13.712
-Really? You up in here
drinking? -* Is like a drug

30:13.745 --> 30:15.948
Really? You in here
gonna lecture me again?

30:15.982 --> 30:18.885
-* And you -You ain't gonna
get one. Give me that bottle.

30:18.918 --> 30:24.156
* Must be the plug

30:24.190 --> 30:26.358
* I can't get away,
want you every day *

30:26.392 --> 30:28.060
Hakeem, what the hell
you smoking?

30:28.094 --> 30:29.896
* When you medicate,
all the pain goes away *

30:29.929 --> 30:31.697
What you been drinking?

30:31.730 --> 30:34.700
-* Because love...
-I hate them DuBois so much!

30:34.733 --> 30:36.468
Every last one of 'em
needs capping.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.137
I'm not even gonna argue
with that,

30:38.170 --> 30:40.806
but we not about to talk
about capping nobody, Keem.

30:40.839 --> 30:44.911
Oh, for real? Did you know
Anika moved in with Angelo?

30:44.944 --> 30:47.313
I'm supposed to watch
another man raise my child

30:47.346 --> 30:49.916
while you drink yourself
to death over some trick?

30:49.949 --> 30:52.985
-* If I'm hooked on you... *
-Wait. Is this corny ass Warren?

30:53.019 --> 30:55.354
Yeah, it's the stupid bitch.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.324
I was gonna put this ho
on my album

30:58.357 --> 31:00.059
with a song called
"Love is a Drug."

31:00.092 --> 31:02.394
Love is a...?

31:02.428 --> 31:03.829
Oh, hell, no, bruh.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.565
We fixin' to clap back on this.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.400
Well, now,
you know damn clapbacks.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.502
* You should be illegal...

31:10.536 --> 31:13.039
Which one is Warren vocals?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.740
JAMAL: The one
that says "Warren vocals."

31:14.773 --> 31:16.375
* I know the deal 'cause... *

31:16.408 --> 31:18.010
Keem, what are you doing?

31:18.044 --> 31:19.946
-Hakeem...
-Bye, ho.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.780
JAMAL:
Keem. (laughs)

31:21.813 --> 31:23.615
Bye again.

31:23.649 --> 31:25.051
Hakeem.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.953
(laughs)
Hell, yeah. Bye, ho.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.121
Pour out liquor for the ho.

31:29.155 --> 31:32.691
I was literally about
to put this ho on my song.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.560
Keem, on my damn record!

31:34.593 --> 31:36.695
* Oh, no, no, no, no...

31:36.728 --> 31:39.631
Hey, that. Look, look, look,
look, look, look.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.434
* Love

31:42.468 --> 31:44.303
* And you

31:44.336 --> 31:45.804
Let's go!

31:45.837 --> 31:48.440
You're so damn loud.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.976
* Because you got me...

31:50.009 --> 31:52.744
-* Trapped, trapped...
-Hey! Yes!

31:52.778 --> 31:54.646
Wait, wait. Hold up,
hold up, hold up. Sorry. Stop.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.616
Stop, stop.
Start it again. All right.

31:57.649 --> 32:00.886
* It's gettin' kinda heavy,
I can't handle all the baggage *

32:00.919 --> 32:04.056
* Never thought that I would
have to kick another habit *

32:04.090 --> 32:07.593
* Can't believe I let you
get away with so much damage *

32:07.626 --> 32:09.661
* Look at me

32:09.695 --> 32:13.599
* You did my heart so wrong
-* So wrong

32:13.632 --> 32:15.334
* One minute you love me

32:15.367 --> 32:16.835
-* The next minute you don't *
-* You don't *

32:16.868 --> 32:19.238
* Why is it so hard
to let you alone? *

32:19.271 --> 32:22.474
-* Let you alone -* Baby,
I don't wanna do it no more *

32:22.508 --> 32:24.977
-* No more
-* Because love

32:25.011 --> 32:28.514
* Is like a drug

32:28.547 --> 32:34.953
* And you must be the plug

32:34.987 --> 32:36.522
* Because you got me

32:36.555 --> 32:39.325
* Trapped, trapped, trapped

32:39.358 --> 32:41.093
* Trapped, trapped,
trapped *

32:41.127 --> 32:42.995
* And you must be the plug

32:43.029 --> 32:46.265
* You codeine, you morphine

32:46.298 --> 32:49.835
* I need caffeine so I can wake
up from this bad dream, uh *

32:49.868 --> 32:51.970
* Run up in the spot, give me
what ya got, we'll be in *

32:52.004 --> 32:54.906
* And out, we'll be in and out,
baby rockabye. * -(gunshots)

33:00.146 --> 33:02.148
You've reached Detective Pamela
Rose of the New York City

33:02.181 --> 33:03.849
Police Department. Please leave
a message, and I'll get back

33:03.882 --> 33:05.851
-to you as soon as I can.
-(beep) Uh, hey, hey, baby.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.486
It's-it's just me again.
It's Andre.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.655
Um, listen, I-I just wanted
to apologize to you now

33:09.688 --> 33:11.523
for everything I said,
everything I-I did.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.959
I need to tell you, I need
to explain to you what happened,

33:13.992 --> 33:15.461
and it's-it's
all just a misunderstanding,

33:15.494 --> 33:17.463
you know,
because of my medication.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.798
Uh, my-my doctor, he, um...

33:19.831 --> 33:22.234
Well, he-he was my doctor.
He's not my doctor anymore.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.103
Pamela, um...

33:26.038 --> 33:28.374
You're all that's good
in my life right now, baby.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.043
I need you, please.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.412
Call me back.

33:35.181 --> 33:37.083
(knocking at door)

33:42.454 --> 33:44.623
Hi, Pamela.

34:01.039 --> 34:05.177
That's the weapon I used
to kill Marlo Jones.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.380
The murder I confessed to you
a few days ago.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.748
You can take it down
to the precinct,

34:09.781 --> 34:11.250
they'll file it away
as evidence,

34:11.283 --> 34:13.252
and it'll put me away
for the rest of my life.

34:13.285 --> 34:16.021
Why would I do that?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.424
You called me a liar.

34:18.457 --> 34:22.094
And accused me of colluding
with people I don't even know.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.430
I know. I'm sorry.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.198
-Look...
-(scoffs) You're sorry.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.599
-I'm sorry.
-No.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.136
I'm-I'm sorry, Pamela.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.804
(sighs)
Look, okay.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.241
I called you over here
for something different, okay?

34:35.274 --> 34:37.409
You know, it-it's good news,
all right?

34:37.443 --> 34:39.378
My family figured out
how Diana DuBois

34:39.411 --> 34:42.148
-was trying to work with my...
-Andre. Andre.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.649
I don't care about Diana.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.652
Or-or any damn DuBois
or whoever else.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.920
I don't even know these people.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.089
-Yeah, and I... -But yet
you charge me with betrayal

34:51.123 --> 34:53.292
without any evidence.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.060
And that's based on what?

34:55.093 --> 34:57.896
The fact that you and I
happened to meet

34:57.929 --> 35:00.232
when-when your family
is going through all of this?

35:00.266 --> 35:03.469
-I'm sorry, baby. -No.
No, no, don't-don't "baby" me.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.172
-Andre, no. Don't. Don't.
-Come on. Hey...

35:06.205 --> 35:08.607
You-you accused me of treachery,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.242
even when I trusted you

35:10.276 --> 35:12.244
with the biggest secret
of my entire life.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.579
You can trust me, baby.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.682
-You can...
-Andre, I killed someone.

35:18.384 --> 35:20.118
I murdered them.

35:20.152 --> 35:25.457
And I have to carry that with me
every day until I die.

35:25.491 --> 35:28.994
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

35:29.027 --> 35:34.766
To-to walk around with-with the
weight of-of a guilt like this.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.769
You have no idea!

35:37.803 --> 35:41.673
-No idea. You-You could never
understand what it is -Pamela.

35:41.707 --> 35:42.841
-I'm dealing with.
-Pamela!

35:45.844 --> 35:48.814
I do know...

35:48.847 --> 35:51.583
how it feels.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.487
I know exactly,

35:55.521 --> 36:00.526
exactly what that kind of guilt
can do to you.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.164
Ask me how.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.937
I did something terrible,
Pamela.

36:15.707 --> 36:18.610
I know.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.820
-(door opens)
-THIRSTY: Lucious!

36:28.854 --> 36:30.756
Oh, hey.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.658
Look, there's something rotten
in Denmark, okay? I went above

36:32.691 --> 36:34.893
due diligence,
tapping every contact I got.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.429
There never was a Pamela Rose
in the NYPD.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.265
-What? (scoffs)
-Never heard of her.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.702
Andre's getting played.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.276
Baby, what happened?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.845
You can tell me.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.181
I, um...

36:56.214 --> 36:58.116
(phone buzzing)

37:06.392 --> 37:08.126
He's not answering his phone.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.429
Last time I had eyes on him,
he was headed to his house.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.763
Let's go.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.031
You got it?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.433
I'm good, I'm good.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.404
(sighs)

37:18.437 --> 37:20.639
What did you do?

37:20.672 --> 37:23.642
The car bomb.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.977
Uh...

37:27.513 --> 37:29.848
(exhales)

37:33.852 --> 37:35.921
It was me.

37:35.954 --> 37:39.858
I tried to kill my father.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.296
I tried to kill him.

37:44.330 --> 37:47.799
I do know what it's like...

37:47.833 --> 37:50.402
to carry guilt.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.771
Hmm?

37:56.007 --> 37:58.176
And you understand me.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.946
We understand each other.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.714
Right?

38:04.616 --> 38:06.518
I got you.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.623
I got you.

38:15.026 --> 38:18.964
I have a confession, too, Andre.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.801
I'm not NYPD.

38:22.834 --> 38:26.472
I'm Vegas Metro. Undercover.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.107
And I've been after you
for quite some time.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.444
And I finally got your ass.
(chuckles)

38:32.478 --> 38:35.447
You have got to be
the dumbest criminal

38:35.481 --> 38:38.016
in the history of crime,
you know that?

38:39.685 --> 38:42.020
Did you really think
that you would get away with it?

38:42.053 --> 38:46.992
I mean, with everything
you've done?

38:51.497 --> 38:54.733
I know about the car bomb,
you idiot.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.669
I've known all along.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.005
And the guy you hired to do it,
Franco,

39:00.038 --> 39:02.007
I know about him, too.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.644
Or what's left of him,
I should say.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.313
And poor Giuliana Green.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.483
Got a little too overconfident
and got herself killed.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.052
By you.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.088
But most of all,

39:17.122 --> 39:19.357
I know you're going away
for the rest of your life.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.362
Andre Lyon,

39:24.396 --> 39:26.164
you are under arrest.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.667
You have the right
to remain silent...

39:28.700 --> 39:31.903
Stop. Stop! On the ground.

39:31.937 --> 39:32.938
On the ground. Stop!

39:34.105 --> 39:36.007
(gunshots)

39:36.041 --> 39:39.377
(grunting)

39:51.089 --> 39:53.459
-(shouting)
-(grunting)

39:53.492 --> 39:55.761
(choking)

39:58.163 --> 39:59.431
(grunts)

40:09.340 --> 40:12.811
What? Oh...

40:12.844 --> 40:14.780
(shouts)

40:17.115 --> 40:19.117
Pamela, come on.
Hey, hey.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.118
Come on, Pamela.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.953
Pamela. Pamela! Pamela!

40:27.158 --> 40:28.760
(knocking at door)

40:28.794 --> 40:32.097
LUCIOUS:
Andre, son, are you okay?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.265
COOKIE:
Andre!

40:34.299 --> 40:36.802
Andre. We coming in!

40:36.835 --> 40:38.570
Ma, Ma, Pop, Pop, I'm-I'm sorry.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.405
I'm-I'm so sorry.
I-I didn't mean to do it.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.273
-Are you okay?
-I didn't mean to kill her, Ma.

40:42.307 --> 40:43.509
-You got to believe me. You got
to believe me. -What do you...

40:43.542 --> 40:45.410
-what do you mean, kill?
-Uh, and I liked her.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.412
She-she was so nice, and
she was... she was beautiful.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.815
She was kind, and I-I liked her.
I liked her, Ma, and...

40:49.848 --> 40:51.817
-Okay, come here.
-And I-I trusted her, Ma.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.752
I-I trusted her.
I-I thought she'd understand.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.754
But-but you were right.
Ma, you were... you were right.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.589
You were right. She's no good.
She's no good. No good.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.924
-She-She's a cop. She was a cop.
-Okay.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.926
All right, Andre,
what did you do?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.828
She-she lied to me, Ma.
She-she lied.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.363
This whole time, she
was lying to me. And-and she...

41:05.396 --> 41:07.132
-she was a cop, and-and she was
laughing at me. -(shushing)

41:07.165 --> 41:09.434
-Son. Calm down. Let us help you
for a minute. -Calm down.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.102
Help me?!
How you gonna help me, Pop?!

41:11.136 --> 41:14.873
Look, look, look, look
what I did, Pop. Look, look.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.174
(crying):
Look what I did.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.978
Look at her.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.648
I'm sorry, Ma. I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to hurt her.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.382
Okay. It's okay, baby.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.618
-(sobs)
-Come here. It's okay.

41:26.652 --> 41:29.187
No, Ma, it's not gonna be okay,
Ma. It's not gonna be okay.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.723
I killed her. I'm a killer.

41:31.757 --> 41:34.560
(panting):
Look, Pop, Pop...

41:34.593 --> 41:36.728
I killed her.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.799
There's no body there.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.068
No. No, no, no, no.
You-you can't take that away.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.070
-You can't take this away, Pop.
-Andre! Look!

41:45.103 --> 41:46.404
There is nothing here, son.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.006
-She's right there, Ma.
-There is

41:48.039 --> 41:51.176
nothing here, Andre!
There's nothing here!

41:51.209 --> 41:53.178
Okay? Baby, look.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.314
There is nobody in here
but you and us.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.750
There's nothing here, baby.

41:58.784 --> 42:02.353
(panting)
Look, look, go see for yourself.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.355
There's-there's nothing there.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.758
Nothing!

42:08.393 --> 42:11.496
Oh, hell. No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.632
Where is she?

42:18.269 --> 42:20.672
(Andre exhales sharply)

42:20.706 --> 42:22.874
(sobs)

42:22.908 --> 42:24.109
So what are you drinking?

42:24.142 --> 42:25.611
PAMELA:
Whatever you're buying.

42:26.812 --> 42:28.479
Mr. Lyon?

42:31.650 --> 42:33.184
I killed her.

42:33.218 --> 42:36.287
She was right here. I-I swear,
she was right... Where is she?

42:36.321 --> 42:38.724
Next time, you'll go with me.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.258
ANDRE:
Oh, my God.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.527
(crying):
Where-where did she go?

42:42.560 --> 42:44.362
Where is she? Where is she?!

42:44.395 --> 42:46.732
I just... I saw her.
She was here.

42:46.765 --> 42:50.969
The DuBois are coming at me
and my brothers one by one.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.038
Through people pretending
to care about us.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.974
(grunting)

42:56.007 --> 42:56.975
(shouts)

42:57.008 --> 42:58.810
(grunting)

43:00.946 --> 43:02.347
(shouts)

43:03.114 --> 43:04.616
Oh, no.

43:04.650 --> 43:07.385
Oh, no. God, help!

43:07.418 --> 43:08.787
Oh, God.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.222
You see what that bitch did
to my baby?

43:11.256 --> 43:13.659
Oh, God!

43:15.293 --> 43:17.996
-She was right here.
-Baby, I know.

43:18.029 --> 43:20.832
I swear, she was right...
What's wrong with me?

43:20.866 --> 43:23.669
(sobs)
Oh, God!

43:23.702 --> 43:25.871

44:17.723 --> 44:20.658

He treats his nurse like family
and his family like strangers.

44:32.370 --> 44:34.072
