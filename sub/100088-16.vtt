- Excuse me.
- I'm just having a little fun.

00:06.103 --> 00:07.235
What you're doing here

00:07.237 --> 00:09.935
is dishonoring the
memory of our brothers

00:09.937 --> 00:14.809
- who died doing the things you claim to do.

LINDELL: Well, you continue
to impress me, Spenser.

00:17.107 --> 00:19.494
You'd be an outstanding
candidate for STA-21.

00:19.496 --> 00:21.213
- Seaman to Admiral?
- Being an admiral

00:21.215 --> 00:22.417
would give you the kind of influence

00:22.419 --> 00:24.919
it takes to make a real difference.

00:24.921 --> 00:27.289
Can you die at your job?

00:27.291 --> 00:30.158
No matter what, I will
always be with you.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.560
My men and my mission come first.

CONNERS: What is it
that you want, Jason?

00:34.164 --> 00:36.514
I want to make sure
that my men come home.

00:36.516 --> 00:39.454
You need to be open for
a relationship to work.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.671

never allow that to happen.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.089
Let 'em know what's happening.

All right, listen up.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.524
I need all the eyes I can get.

03:47.526 --> 03:50.327
We're passing McEntire.

03:50.329 --> 03:53.097
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.755
Be advised. You've
got what appears to be

03:54.757 --> 03:56.867
two enemy vehicles moving
towards your location.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Punch it!

04:10.349 --> 04:11.548
We need to slow 'em down.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.851
A few frags might do the trick.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.452
Hey, pass them out. Let's do it.

04:35.173 --> 04:38.908
Sir, we lost eyes on.

04:42.748 --> 04:44.715
You still have enemy
vehicles in pursuit.

04:44.717 --> 04:46.717
JASON: Affirmative.
They're gaining on us.

04:48.253 --> 04:50.887
They'll be overtaken before
they hit the exfil point.

04:53.659 --> 04:56.593
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base. New plan.

04:56.595 --> 04:58.428

That's good copy.

All right, call the helo,
have them adjust.

05:10.342 --> 05:12.608
Tell them it's gonna be a hot extract.

05:23.889 --> 05:25.889
These guys don't quit, do they?

05:25.891 --> 05:26.891

- Copy that.

05:43.391 --> 05:45.073
We have two enemy vehicles on our six.

05:45.075 --> 05:47.443
I'm gonna mark the friendly
vehicle to identify it.

to make sure we get home

order with our families

time for three months.

to get some kind of a special
assignment for you in J-bad.

hip thing that I have.

- Those hip exercises?

09:59.693 --> 10:01.059
- Yeah.
- Get that movement going?

- Oh, gracious, that hip.

10:18.155 --> 10:20.756
All right, I love you. Bye-bye.

10:22.248 --> 10:24.916
Well, doesn't look like
Mikey's coming home.

10:24.918 --> 10:28.252
- Oh, no.
- Made some kind of an all-star team.

10:28.254 --> 10:31.113
And they're playing the
game in Minnesota, so...

10:31.115 --> 10:32.677
- That's great.
- Yeah.

10:32.679 --> 10:34.558
That sounds like a good
opportunity for him.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.627
Yeah. Right.

10:36.629 --> 10:39.170
You don't think it's so good.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.261
Usually the kids are home,

10:40.263 --> 10:42.166
and we have this pre-deployment routine.

10:42.168 --> 10:46.403
I'm not used to being so
invested in a Team guy,

10:46.405 --> 10:48.672
and I don't know how any
of this works, either.

10:48.674 --> 10:50.941
- How what works?
- Us.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.577
7,000 miles apart for three months.

10:53.579 --> 10:55.112
- Yeah, we'll make it work.

Nah, it's, it's worse. It's Lindell.

11:01.987 --> 11:03.853
He wants to see me right away.

11:03.855 --> 11:04.955
I got to go, okay?

11:07.326 --> 11:10.194
Didn't realize how much
stuff we had until now.

11:10.196 --> 11:11.795
It is daunting.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.348
It's nothing we can't handle.

11:13.350 --> 11:15.314
Here, can you mark that
for the living room, babe?

11:15.316 --> 11:18.439
I'm so excited for my new canopy bed.

11:18.441 --> 11:19.836
And so is Teena.

11:19.838 --> 11:21.537
Ah, well, your new bed will be

11:21.539 --> 11:23.773
the first thing I set up
in the new house, honey.

11:23.775 --> 11:25.341
So you and Teena can have sweet dreams

11:25.343 --> 11:26.543
our first night there.

11:30.849 --> 11:33.950
How long will you be gone?

11:33.952 --> 11:35.118
Three months.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.786
Three short months, okay?

11:36.788 --> 11:38.688
Fighting bad guys?

11:38.690 --> 11:41.891
Uh, not every day.

11:41.893 --> 11:44.828

has gotten pretty boring.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.963
Where will you live?

11:46.965 --> 11:48.865
On a big base with the rest of my team.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.591
Yeah, it's like a big sleepover

11:50.593 --> 11:52.291
- with Uncle Jason every night.
- Yeah.

11:52.293 --> 11:54.703
Only I won't get to sleep
in a canopy bed, so...

11:54.705 --> 11:56.204
boring.

11:56.206 --> 11:58.874
We should have a
sleepover in our new house.

11:58.876 --> 12:01.710
All of us can sleep in
my new bed tomorrow night.

12:01.712 --> 12:04.913
(LAUGHS) I don't think we'd all fit.

12:04.915 --> 12:06.849
Right?

12:06.851 --> 12:10.641
But you need extra
good sleep for your job.

12:10.643 --> 12:13.344
If you're tired, something
bad might happen.

12:16.661 --> 12:18.894
Uh, you know what, honey?

12:18.896 --> 12:22.397
A sleepover sounds
like an excellent idea.

12:22.399 --> 12:24.032
We're doing it.

the hell this is about?

some going-away ideas

Master Chief, I know you
would normally receive

12:45.466 --> 12:48.327
advance notice about this,
but as I've only just made

12:48.329 --> 12:49.891
this decision and we are short on time,

12:49.893 --> 12:53.619
I'm informing both of you
that instead of deploying

12:53.621 --> 12:56.129
with Bravo Team later this week,

12:56.131 --> 12:59.021
Petty Officer Quinn will travel
to Laughlin Air Force Base

12:59.023 --> 13:01.471
tomorrow for six weeks
of advanced armory school.

13:01.473 --> 13:02.577
The hell I am.

13:02.579 --> 13:04.247
There's no chance I'm sitting out...

13:04.249 --> 13:07.696
Sir, Bravo Team is deploying
to a war zone in two days.

13:07.698 --> 13:08.775
And a few weeks ago,

13:08.777 --> 13:10.338
Mr. Quinn assaulted a patron

13:10.340 --> 13:12.479
at a Washington, D.C. pub.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.615
And this is how I'm handling it.

13:14.617 --> 13:15.949
You what?

13:15.951 --> 13:17.730
Some douche was stealing valor, okay?

13:17.732 --> 13:19.841
- And, sir, I barely even touched him.
- Sir, if I had known...

13:19.843 --> 13:21.145
I imagine you would
have done very little,

13:21.147 --> 13:22.789
much like after his
altercation at the bar

13:22.791 --> 13:24.991
in Guam on your last deployment.

13:24.993 --> 13:27.328
Quinn here has a pattern of behavior

13:27.330 --> 13:29.081
that's been ignored for far too long.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.197
Sir, you should be
patting me on the back

13:31.199 --> 13:32.498
instead of kicking me in the ass

13:32.500 --> 13:33.940
for putting that fraud in his place!

13:35.222 --> 13:37.437
Look at this as an
opportunity to cool off

13:37.439 --> 13:39.762
and to prove to me that
you are capable of handling

13:39.764 --> 13:42.278
the high-stress
environment of Afghanistan.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.344
What, are you trying to tell
me I might not deploy at all?

13:44.346 --> 13:45.478
We have any other options, sir?

13:45.480 --> 13:46.847
We could open a formal

13:46.849 --> 13:48.476
disciplinary review into the incident.

13:48.478 --> 13:50.640
No, sir.

13:50.642 --> 13:53.042
Quinn will do his time in Texas.

13:56.158 --> 13:59.311
You know, deployment
really isn't a big deal.

13:59.313 --> 14:01.603
It's not any more
dangerous than a spin-up.

14:01.605 --> 14:02.629
It's just a longer trip.

14:02.631 --> 14:04.297
I know what I signed up for.

14:04.299 --> 14:07.032
Me worrying isn't gonna
make it any easier for you.

14:07.034 --> 14:09.468
This is usually a much
more difficult conversation.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.470
Thank you. Gives me one
less thing to worry about.

14:11.472 --> 14:13.705
Well, what else are you worried about?

14:13.707 --> 14:15.174
I need to give Lindell an answer

14:15.176 --> 14:16.852
about STA-21, and I don't have one yet.

14:16.854 --> 14:18.144
What, you mean you haven't

14:18.146 --> 14:20.345
instantly made a life-altering decision?

14:20.347 --> 14:22.547
Point and shoot is about as
life-altering as I'm used to.

14:22.549 --> 14:24.116
Okay.

14:24.118 --> 14:26.051
Well, then let's pro/con it.

14:26.053 --> 14:29.221
Pro... you're set to become an admiral.

14:29.223 --> 14:30.722
Con?

14:30.724 --> 14:32.958
Well, I get pulled from the field
and have to leave Bravo.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.293
And end up where?

14:34.295 --> 14:35.494
Rhode Island

14:35.496 --> 14:37.459
for basic officer training first.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.531
And then, uh...

14:39.533 --> 14:41.776
over three years I'd be
commissioned an ensign,

14:41.778 --> 14:43.017
have to do some more officer training.

14:43.019 --> 14:45.858
But if you imagine yourself
on a bigger stage,

14:45.860 --> 14:48.072
why is being pulled
from the field a con?

14:49.510 --> 14:51.874
Well, a few months
ago, I told my dad that

14:51.876 --> 14:54.379
I loved being a Team guy more
than anything in the world.

14:54.381 --> 14:56.515
I meant it.

14:56.517 --> 14:58.550
You know, and I'm-I'm not...

14:58.552 --> 15:00.885
I'm not sure that I'm ready to
stop door-kicking permanently.

15:00.887 --> 15:02.354
So wait.

15:02.356 --> 15:04.856
Program's got an age limit.

15:04.858 --> 15:08.676
So... if I want to point the spear

15:08.678 --> 15:10.948
rather than be the tip of it,

15:10.950 --> 15:12.940
then, uh, it's now or never.

15:12.942 --> 15:15.309
<i>(BEEPING)</i>

15:17.138 --> 15:19.426
I never seen you take it
from a cake-eater like that.

15:19.428 --> 15:21.034
- That right?
- Especially one that's messing

15:21.036 --> 15:22.725
- with your team, buddy.
- I'll tell you what, you know what,

15:22.727 --> 15:25.209
you didn't give me much of a
leg to stand on with Lindell.

15:25.211 --> 15:27.086
Look, man, I saw what happened to you

15:27.088 --> 15:28.379
when you were away from Bravo, okay?

15:28.381 --> 15:30.247
And I-I'm not just so
sure I can make it, Jace.

15:30.249 --> 15:31.571
Well, you have to, all right?

15:31.573 --> 15:32.982
You got to suck it up
and do it, all right?

15:32.984 --> 15:34.607
You'll be back in Texas,
you'll be close to home.

15:34.609 --> 15:36.519
- You'll make ribs...
- My brothers are gonna be in J-bad

15:36.521 --> 15:38.326
where I should be, Jace!

15:38.328 --> 15:39.967
And I just don't think
I can just accept that!

15:39.969 --> 15:41.368
Well, you're gonna have to accept it!

15:41.370 --> 15:43.326
Lindell has got you in
the crosshairs right now,

15:43.328 --> 15:44.527
right, and he's got an
itchy trigger finger.

15:44.529 --> 15:46.930
Do not give him a reason
to put a bullet in you.

15:48.959 --> 15:51.449
So I'm supposed to do what,
just, just scoot on back

15:51.451 --> 15:52.928
to Texas and be a good ol' boy,

15:52.930 --> 15:53.993
- is that it?
- That's right, that's right,

15:53.995 --> 15:55.386
you're gonna scoot on back to Texas

15:55.388 --> 15:56.404
and you're gonna be a good ol' boy,

15:56.406 --> 15:57.803
that's what you're
gonna do, but right now

15:57.805 --> 15:59.442
you're gonna go have a
nice barbecue with the team

15:59.444 --> 16:01.777
and you're gonna say
goodbye to everybody, nicely.

16:01.779 --> 16:03.146
Then you're gonna go to Texas

16:03.148 --> 16:05.338
and you're gonna walk
the line for six weeks,

16:05.340 --> 16:07.149
so you can come back and rejoin us.

16:07.151 --> 16:08.784
You keep your nose clean, do not

16:08.786 --> 16:11.320
give me a reason to
replace you permanently.

16:19.764 --> 16:22.564
(DOOR OPENS)

16:25.747 --> 16:27.413
Well, it might not be that bad, Sonny.

16:27.415 --> 16:28.914
Easy there, Blackburn.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.841
My tri-tip is always

16:30.843 --> 16:32.914
three-star Michigan quality.

16:32.916 --> 16:35.840
It's, uh, Michelin, not Michigan, Sonny.

16:35.842 --> 16:37.089
Michelin?

16:37.091 --> 16:39.659
Well, what in the hell's a
tire company know about meat?

16:39.661 --> 16:41.836
I was talking about your
punishment, not your meat.

16:41.838 --> 16:44.797
Yeah, I know what you were
talking about there, Blackburn.

16:44.799 --> 16:47.667
'Cause nobody ever questions
the quality of my meat.

16:47.669 --> 16:51.498
Well, just think of
it as time to recharge.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.639
You know, get a fresh perspective.

16:53.641 --> 16:55.240
(CHUCKLES) Perspective I got:

16:55.242 --> 16:57.309
Lindell, well, he's looking

16:57.311 --> 16:59.578
for scalps just to prove he's boss.

17:00.614 --> 17:02.113
Just watch your back, boys.

17:02.115 --> 17:03.181
Hey, yo.

17:03.183 --> 17:04.530
Gonna miss you, knucklehead.

17:04.531 --> 17:05.751
(GRUNTS)

17:05.752 --> 17:07.653
Didn't think you were gonna make it.

17:07.655 --> 17:11.368
Yeah, well, Naima gave me a hall
pass when she heard the news.

17:11.371 --> 17:13.227
Couldn't let you leave
without saying goodbye.

17:13.229 --> 17:15.926
Wow! Wow, look at that right there.

17:15.929 --> 17:18.997
Unbelievable, I finally
got somebody on my side.

Hey, Ray, you want a beer?

17:20.434 --> 17:21.933
Yeah.

17:21.935 --> 17:24.669
I just wish you'd make
it easier on yourself

17:24.671 --> 17:26.271
by not sticking your
hand in the hornets' nest,

17:26.272 --> 17:27.711
thinking it won't get stung.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.870
Well... (CLEARS THROAT) you see,

17:29.872 --> 17:33.377
I did not join Bravo
to be a wallflower, Ray.

17:33.379 --> 17:35.947
Yeah?

17:35.949 --> 17:39.483
And you know what? Your
Texas-sized anger management issues

17:39.485 --> 17:41.953
put us a man down at the
worst possible time, Sonny.

17:44.490 --> 17:46.390
All right, come on.

17:46.392 --> 17:48.226
Get something to eat.

17:48.228 --> 17:49.560
You know I'm right.

Uh...

18:01.451 --> 18:02.707
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.208
What, work?

18:04.210 --> 18:05.509
Do you think terrorist activity

18:05.511 --> 18:08.379
in Afghanistan is too quiet?

18:08.381 --> 18:11.069
Hmm, well... (CLEARS THROAT)
I'm not as up to speed

18:11.071 --> 18:13.351
on the big picture as you are, but...

18:13.353 --> 18:15.653
yeah, in general...

18:15.655 --> 18:17.755
too much stability in a
country that hasn't seen

18:17.757 --> 18:19.570
peace in decades, that
would ping my radar.

18:19.572 --> 18:20.858
This is what I've been saying.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.526
But the popular opinion
up chain of command

18:22.528 --> 18:24.829
is that the calm is the benefit

18:24.831 --> 18:26.897
of peace talks with the Taliban.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.110
And that I'm too green

18:29.112 --> 18:30.790
to know any better.

18:30.792 --> 18:33.106
Getting a lot of "stay in
your lane, little girl"?

18:33.108 --> 18:34.289

18:34.291 --> 18:35.572
in this role on deployment.

18:35.574 --> 18:38.742
Maybe they're right.

18:46.707 --> 18:48.897
I'm about to hop on a
call with the Intel officer

18:48.899 --> 18:50.453
on the ground over there,
get the lay of the land.

18:50.455 --> 18:52.856

RAY: These questions
Jameelah's asking, man,

19:04.137 --> 19:06.058
they're just getting harder
and harder to answer.

19:06.060 --> 19:07.909

off standing Sonny down

19:12.210 --> 19:14.110
without reading me in first, huh?

19:14.112 --> 19:15.711
It's messed up that he bypassed you,

19:15.713 --> 19:17.546

he-he made his own bed.

19:17.548 --> 19:19.481

the new Clay Spenser way.

That's the best you got, huh?

makes you feel any better,

miss you more than me

JASON (CHUCKLES): That's cute.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.910
No, it doesn't make me feel any better.

19:47.912 --> 19:49.745
Okay, but I tell you what,

19:49.747 --> 19:51.644
when your livelihood is
ripped away from you,

19:51.646 --> 19:53.541
I'll come around and
I'll start making jokes

19:53.543 --> 19:54.583
- about it, how about that?
- Hey, Sonny!

19:54.585 --> 19:56.351
- Easy, man, easy.
- What? You know, I-I'm actually curious.

19:56.353 --> 19:58.067
I'm just curious... it's
been on my mind here.

19:58.069 --> 20:00.622
How in the hell did Lindell

20:00.624 --> 20:03.258
find out what happened in D.C., huh?

20:03.260 --> 20:04.693
You happen to tell him in one of your

20:04.695 --> 20:06.428
private meetings there, golden boy, hmm?

20:06.430 --> 20:07.852
Why would I do that?

20:07.854 --> 20:09.097
Well, the teacher's pet

20:09.099 --> 20:10.599
does need his star, doesn't he?

20:10.601 --> 20:12.835
Heard somebody from the bar called DoD.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.336
- Oh, really?
- We don't talk about you, Sonny.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.639
Mmm. Then what do you talk about, hmm?

20:17.641 --> 20:19.474
You're always talking about
how he has a shine on you.

20:19.476 --> 20:21.041
Huh? All these opportunities.

20:21.043 --> 20:22.401
So you ain't narcing out your brothers,

20:22.403 --> 20:24.127
- then what the hell you talking about?!
- That's enough!

20:24.129 --> 20:26.213
- That is enough!
- JASON: Sonny, take it easy.

20:26.215 --> 20:27.648
What is it?!

20:27.650 --> 20:31.770
You look like you got something
to say! Spit it out!

20:31.772 --> 20:34.054
He's pushing me for STA-21.

20:34.056 --> 20:35.389

20:35.391 --> 20:37.057
Yeah.

enough for him, is it?

20:42.398 --> 20:43.664
No, no, no.

20:43.666 --> 20:45.566
Yeah, why don't you eat some cake, huh?

20:45.568 --> 20:46.667
Eat that cake.

20:46.669 --> 20:49.236
Yeah.

20:49.238 --> 20:50.905
I haven't said yes.

20:50.907 --> 20:53.207
SONNY: Well, no, you haven't
said no, either, have you?

20:53.209 --> 20:54.575
Because Bravo's just been another

20:54.577 --> 20:55.775
rung on the ladder, hasn't it?

20:55.777 --> 20:57.144
- Hasn't it?
- RAY: Hey, hold up.

20:57.146 --> 20:58.645
Just because you're
content where you are

20:58.647 --> 21:00.014

- Oh, shut your mouth!

Roger that there, Warrant Officer Perry!

21:02.251 --> 21:03.683
Okay, you know what?
Hey, you're out of line.

21:03.685 --> 21:04.708
Take a walk, cool off.

21:04.710 --> 21:06.320
You put yourself on the

21:11.885 --> 21:14.448
a guy on Bravo getting shivved like this

21:14.450 --> 21:16.397
right before deployment,
there would be a mutiny.

21:16.399 --> 21:18.765
A mutiny.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.767
And it'd be led by you.

21:22.538 --> 21:25.005
And you're just sitting on your hands.

21:25.007 --> 21:27.241
You're sitting on your
hands, and every one of you

21:27.243 --> 21:29.108

21:29.110 --> 21:30.510
- You did.
- I did?

21:30.512 --> 21:32.045
Yeah, and the team's paying for it.

21:34.016 --> 21:35.582
Oh, wow.

21:35.584 --> 21:37.350
Okay.

21:37.352 --> 21:40.286
Well, I guess I'm just going
on about about nothing, right?

21:40.288 --> 21:42.622
Ain't that the thing, yeah.

21:42.624 --> 21:44.357

21:44.359 --> 21:47.126
the brotherhood to protect, then...

21:49.830 --> 21:52.798
... ain't no reason
for me to stick around.

21:55.771 --> 21:57.303
Yeah, you were not joking

21:57.305 --> 21:59.973
with the peace with
the Taliban party line.

21:59.975 --> 22:01.374

how do I prove them wrong?

22:10.718 --> 22:12.618
(SIGHS) Well, first,

22:12.620 --> 22:15.254
you're gonna need a credible
line of facts to follow.

22:15.256 --> 22:17.223
Next, thick skin.

22:17.225 --> 22:19.925
They're gonna accuse
you of chasing ghosts.

22:19.927 --> 22:21.493
Worse, if you're wrong.

22:21.495 --> 22:22.828
Well, it looks like I need to start

22:22.830 --> 22:24.830
crossing my Ts and dotting my Is.

Might be another all-nighter. (SIGHS)

The work will be there when we land.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.898
You're taking a break tomorrow night.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.182
Well, all the meat is gone,

22:43.184 --> 22:44.738
- but we still have some salad left.

22:46.473 --> 22:48.281
Yeah, I'm glad my plant-based initiative

22:48.283 --> 22:49.971
was such a roaring success.

22:49.973 --> 22:51.189
(LAUGHS)

22:51.191 --> 22:54.859
Well, at least Sonny's tri-tip
was better than his attitude.

22:54.861 --> 22:56.995
- Definitely not his finest hour.
- Not his finest hour

22:56.997 --> 22:59.230
because he's being torn
away from his Bravo family.

22:59.232 --> 23:00.264
That's why.

- All right...

not in the conference room.

- What?

24:21.246 --> 24:24.280
There was flooding, the
house took on a lot of water.

24:24.282 --> 24:26.237
Raymond, how bad is it?

24:26.239 --> 24:28.095
We're gonna need to get a contractor

24:28.097 --> 24:30.120
to fix the damage before we move in.

24:30.122 --> 24:32.404
I-I should've known
not to get a new house

promotion... this is so st...

Hey. Stop that.

24:35.694 --> 24:37.694
This is just a little hiccup.

24:37.696 --> 24:39.729
We'll manage.

24:39.731 --> 24:40.930
Yeah.

24:42.967 --> 24:45.868
I'll cancel the movers.

24:45.870 --> 24:48.271
We're not moving today?

24:49.741 --> 24:51.374
Uh, it doesn't look like it, honey.

24:51.376 --> 24:53.543

the strip club this morning?

you're more concerned about

25:35.586 --> 25:38.153
What? What, you're not deploying?

25:38.155 --> 25:42.657
Nope. I got six weeks of hard
time for defending the Trident.

25:42.659 --> 25:44.546
And I'm never gonna
make that mistake again,

25:44.548 --> 25:45.860

is already your worst
nightmare, but, you know...

25:58.508 --> 26:02.677
maybe don't throw any
more gas on the fire.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.022
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

26:06.024 --> 26:09.047
It means getting so
wasted at the strip club

26:09.049 --> 26:10.632
that they have to call
your emergency contact

26:10.634 --> 26:12.519

tell me that I'm wrong.

Oh, you're messing with the
chemistry of my team, sir.

26:50.424 --> 26:53.788
Not the best way to send
Bravo outside the wire,

26:53.790 --> 26:55.361
by benching Sonny

he's the ultimate Team guy.

enters its third decade.

how the war on terror

attitude, Master Chief.

He said, uh, "Rounds
downrange stay downrange".

Don't let your last shot
impact your next one.
