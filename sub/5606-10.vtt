Matter of fact, he was
a pretty good boxer himself

09:43.995 --> 09:46.895
before he got mixed up with
drugs a couple of years ago.

09:46.897 --> 09:49.464
He's been in and out
of jail ever since.

09:49.466 --> 09:51.065
But nine months ago,
he got paroled.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.466
He's working
with his brother.

09:52.468 --> 09:53.967
He's been on
the straight and narrow.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.869
This surf pro up here

09:55.870 --> 09:57.770
was coming back here to get
a few boards for a lesson,

09:57.772 --> 10:00.205
and he found him
like this.

10:03.143 --> 10:04.809
What's up, Max?

10:04.811 --> 10:07.878
Gentlemen. C.O.D. appears
to be blunt force trauma.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.647
And estimated T.O.D.
is about 10:00 p.m. last night.

10:10.649 --> 10:13.016
Looks like a body dump.

10:13.018 --> 10:15.184
That is correct,
Detective Williams.

10:15.186 --> 10:17.052
Lividity pattern on the body
suggests that

10:17.054 --> 10:20.188
he was transported here at least
a few hours after the murder.

10:20.190 --> 10:23.491
That's his
wallet and keys.

10:23.493 --> 10:25.626
Well, clearly, this
wasn't a robbery.

10:25.628 --> 10:27.894
DANNY: Tuned him up pretty
good-- this, uh, looks like

10:27.896 --> 10:29.896
it was maybe personal. Maybe
some leftover hard feelings

10:29.898 --> 10:32.082
from the weigh-in?

10:32.083 --> 10:34.267
Haynes said he was here to spread
some pain and suffering, right?

10:35.870 --> 10:37.970
Maybe he got started early.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.010
Watch me slip
the jab. Slip.

10:47.012 --> 10:48.811
(grunts)
Back.

10:48.813 --> 10:50.078
And double jab. Pop, pop.
Right uppercut, left hook.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.979
MAN:
Looking good, kid!

10:55.517 --> 10:56.716
One, two.

10:56.718 --> 10:57.883
One, two.
Pop, pop.

10:57.885 --> 10:59.618
Hold on, champ.
Yo, man, I thought

10:59.620 --> 11:00.952
I told you
no reporters, man.

11:00.954 --> 11:02.186
Get those vultures
out of here.

11:02.188 --> 11:04.721
Those aren't reporters.
That's Five-O, Buddy.

11:04.723 --> 11:06.122
Hey, guys.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.924
Hey. Listen, uh, we need a word
with your fighter.

11:10.694 --> 11:11.859
It's about Ben, isn't it?

11:11.861 --> 11:13.260
Yeah, it is.

11:13.262 --> 11:15.729
I warned you.

11:17.132 --> 11:18.998
Yeah, what'd he get
arrested for now?

11:20.234 --> 11:22.634
He didn't get arrested.

11:25.105 --> 11:27.605
Benny was
Luke's trainer

11:27.607 --> 11:29.540
all through
his amateur career.

11:29.542 --> 11:33.010
Then he found something
that he liked more than boxing--

11:33.012 --> 11:34.611
cocaine.

11:34.613 --> 11:36.613
My brother had his share
of problems,

11:36.615 --> 11:38.615
but he wasn't a bad guy.

11:38.617 --> 11:40.283
I wouldn't be where I am
without him.

11:40.285 --> 11:42.251
I was just
starting

11:42.253 --> 11:44.119
to trust him again, you know?
He was in my corner,

11:44.121 --> 11:45.704
helping Buddy out.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.288
What happened when the
cameras were turned off

11:47.290 --> 11:49.223
at the weigh-in?

11:49.225 --> 11:52.693
After everyone cleared out,

11:52.695 --> 11:56.329
I laid into Ben for letting
Haynes rile him up.

11:56.331 --> 11:58.997
He was pretty pissed off
when he left.

12:01.301 --> 12:02.566
I said some things
I shouldn't have said.

12:07.172 --> 12:10.806
Luke, I got to ask you
a question. Um,

12:10.808 --> 12:13.241
do you know where Ben might have
gone after he left the arena?

12:14.744 --> 12:16.677
No. He was supposed
to be in here in the morning

12:16.679 --> 12:18.712
at the gym with us, you know?
But...

12:18.714 --> 12:21.114
when he didn't show,
I just figured he was still mad.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.316
Yeah, all right,
listen, uh,

12:23.318 --> 12:26.986
we're very, very sorry
for your loss.

12:26.988 --> 12:30.589
We'll leave you to it,
all right? Take care, kid.

12:30.591 --> 12:32.123
See you, Nick.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.291
Benny, Nicky.

12:34.293 --> 12:37.127
Luke.

12:37.129 --> 12:38.862
You're not fighting tonight.

12:38.864 --> 12:40.597
Not after this.

12:40.599 --> 12:42.765
I'm gonna cancel it.
No. No, you're not.

12:42.767 --> 12:45.134
Unless he's in handcuffs,

12:45.136 --> 12:46.602
I'm getting
in that ring with him.

12:46.604 --> 12:48.036
Think about this.

12:48.038 --> 12:50.905
That's all I've been doing
the last few months.

12:50.907 --> 12:53.807
This is my shot, Nicky.

12:53.809 --> 12:55.775
It may never come along again.

12:55.777 --> 12:59.712
This is what I've been
working my whole life for.

12:59.714 --> 13:01.313
All right, my brother
had his faults,

13:01.315 --> 13:03.882
but I loved him more
than anyone on this Earth.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.150
We talked about
bringing home that belt.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.119
He wanted this for me.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.689
You know what he said?

13:12.691 --> 13:16.359
He said the only person
that could stop me is myself.

13:16.361 --> 13:19.195
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

13:19.197 --> 13:22.131
He wouldn't want me to.

Gentlemen, if you're here
to talk to me

14:03.665 --> 14:06.232
about that bad boy nonsense
that happened at the weigh-in...

14:06.234 --> 14:08.934
(chuckles)
...talk to my manager.

14:08.936 --> 14:10.201
Yeah, actually, we're
here to talk to you

14:10.203 --> 14:11.669
about what happened
afterwards.

14:11.671 --> 14:13.237
Ben Nakano was murdered
last night.

14:13.239 --> 14:16.173
Wow.

14:16.175 --> 14:18.175
That's terrible.

14:18.177 --> 14:19.442
What happened?
I'm gonna show you

14:19.444 --> 14:21.944
right now.

14:21.946 --> 14:23.211
There.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.314
Hold on, wait, you don't think

14:27.316 --> 14:29.115
I had anything
to do with that, do you?

14:29.117 --> 14:31.450
I don't know. I mean, you know,
after what we saw on TV,

14:31.452 --> 14:33.251
it doesn't look like
the two of you'll be

14:33.253 --> 14:35.353
exchanging Christmas
gifts, you know?

14:35.355 --> 14:37.121
All that stuff?

14:37.123 --> 14:39.056
That's just business.

14:39.058 --> 14:41.958
The bling, the arrogance,
the bad boy nonsense?

14:41.960 --> 14:43.859
I mean, it's just a show.
It's what sells.

14:43.861 --> 14:46.695
People like a villain.

14:46.697 --> 14:48.697
I play a good villain.

14:48.699 --> 14:51.132
I mean, pay-per-view sales
went up 18%

14:51.134 --> 14:53.434
the first half hour
after the weigh-in.

14:53.436 --> 14:57.104
Okay, so you're saying there was
no hard feelings afterwards?

14:57.106 --> 14:58.972
I'm not saying that.

14:58.974 --> 15:02.976
But when we left that arena,
any feelings that I had--

15:02.978 --> 15:04.877
they stayed there.

15:04.879 --> 15:06.912
Okay. DANNY: What about, uh,

15:06.914 --> 15:08.813
the rest of your folks?
Can you account for them?

15:08.815 --> 15:11.366
You're wasting
your time.

15:11.367 --> 15:13.918
Look, nobody on my team would
let some thin-skinned ex-con

15:13.920 --> 15:16.186
or his wide-eyed little brother
get in the way

15:16.188 --> 15:19.489
of a $50 million payout
against Manny Garcia next year.

15:19.491 --> 15:22.358
We're way too smart for that.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.161
You're acting like the kid
doesn't stand a chance.

15:26.163 --> 15:27.996
He doesn't.

15:27.998 --> 15:29.998
That isn't a act.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.400
It's a fact.

15:36.806 --> 15:40.073
Oh, Lieutenant Kelly,
Inspector Dunn.

15:40.075 --> 15:41.207
<i> Chag sameach,</i> Max.

15:41.209 --> 15:43.042
Oh, happy holidays
to you as well.

15:43.044 --> 15:45.010
So what do you have for us?

15:45.012 --> 15:48.947
Well, thanks to the magic
of infrared photography,

15:48.949 --> 15:51.749
I discovered some
subdermal bruising

15:51.751 --> 15:53.984
on the victim's
wrists and biceps,

15:53.986 --> 15:55.952
inflicted around
the time of death,

15:55.954 --> 15:57.887
which would be consistent with
the fact that he was restrained

15:57.889 --> 15:59.154
while being assaulted.

15:59.156 --> 16:00.922
So we're talking
multiple attackers?

16:00.924 --> 16:03.457
It appears so.
ABBY: Hmm.

16:03.459 --> 16:05.476
Wow.

16:05.477 --> 16:07.494
Both the orbital bones
are completely shattered.

16:07.496 --> 16:09.329
Yes, the damage
is quite profound.

16:09.331 --> 16:12.899
However, it's the small fracture
on the back of the skull

16:12.901 --> 16:15.468
that yielded
the most interesting clue.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.870
I found these shards

16:17.872 --> 16:20.172
embedded in a laceration
on the scalp.

16:20.174 --> 16:23.308
So someone smashed him in the
back of the head with a bottle.

16:23.310 --> 16:24.542
ABBY: Bright orange-- that's
a pretty distinctive color.

16:24.544 --> 16:26.010
It is.

16:26.012 --> 16:27.811
I rushed the samples to the lab,

16:27.813 --> 16:31.047
and they were able to detect
trace elements on the shards

16:31.049 --> 16:34.083
that made up of ingredients
to the Pala'ai Ale, a local

16:34.085 --> 16:36.318
and seasonal pumpkin microbrew.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.454
Its unique selling point
is the bright orange bottle.

16:39.456 --> 16:43.090
Crime lab says it's not sold
in stores at this time,

16:43.092 --> 16:46.560
however there was a limited
distribution to a few taverns.

16:46.562 --> 16:48.295
One is right here in this town.

16:48.297 --> 16:50.330
A place called The Coral Point.

16:50.332 --> 16:52.199
I know that place.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.067
It's only a couple blocks
from where they found his body.

16:54.069 --> 16:56.836
WOMAN:
<i> I knew him pretty well.</i>

16:56.838 --> 16:59.805
He's a
regular here.

16:59.807 --> 17:02.073
And he's not the criminal
he looks like in that picture.

17:02.075 --> 17:04.842
He was actually
a really sweet guy.

17:04.844 --> 17:07.277
That's him right there
with his brother.

17:07.279 --> 17:10.513
They grew up a few
miles from here.

17:10.515 --> 17:12.515
He was doing
so well.

17:12.517 --> 17:14.116
He was off
the drugs.

17:14.118 --> 17:16.418
Said he was helping his brother
train for the big fight.

17:16.420 --> 17:17.852
So what happened?

17:17.854 --> 17:19.954
Well, we were hoping
you could tell us.

17:19.956 --> 17:23.257
There were two guys
with him last night.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.326
One was a Samoan, over
six foot, 300 pounds.

17:26.328 --> 17:27.927
Did Ben come in
with them?

17:27.929 --> 17:30.296
No, he came in
alone around 8:00.

17:30.298 --> 17:32.164
He was drinking
for a while.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.166
The two guys came
later and joined him.

17:34.168 --> 17:36.168
But they definitely
knew each other?

17:36.170 --> 17:38.036
Yeah, for sure.

17:38.038 --> 17:40.038
Ben seemed happy
to see 'em.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.305
The big guy
bought a round

17:41.307 --> 17:42.839
of shots for the whole place,

17:42.841 --> 17:45.007
like he was
celebrating something.

17:45.009 --> 17:47.976
And he paid with
a $100 bill.

17:47.978 --> 17:50.311
Is there any chance
it's still here?

17:50.313 --> 17:51.845
Yeah, last night's take
is in the safe.

17:51.847 --> 17:53.079
We're gonna need that bill.

17:53.081 --> 17:55.147
We may be able
to pull some prints off of it.

17:55.149 --> 17:56.281
Okay.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.016
Do you know what time Ben left?

17:58.018 --> 18:01.586
They all left together
around 10:00.

18:01.588 --> 18:04.055
It was odd, though.

18:04.057 --> 18:05.956
They said they were
going out into the alley

18:05.958 --> 18:07.557
to have a cigarette.

18:07.559 --> 18:10.560
They left through that door
and never came back.

18:15.399 --> 18:17.232
Huh.

18:17.234 --> 18:19.100
Looks like we've found
our primary crime scene.

18:19.102 --> 18:21.168
Mm-hmm.

18:27.575 --> 18:29.575
This is definitely
the same glass

18:29.577 --> 18:33.178
that Max found lodged
in the victim's scalp.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.946
I'll call CSU.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.982
So, Ben's hanging out with
two of his drinking buddies,

18:37.984 --> 18:41.418
one of whom is rolling
in crisp $100 bills.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.254
Everything's hunky-dory till
they step outside for a smoke.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.389
Then the bromance sours,

18:46.391 --> 18:49.091
escalates, and they end up
beating him to death.

18:49.093 --> 18:51.159
Yeah, if it was
one assailant,

18:51.161 --> 18:53.427
I'd buy that it was
personal, but two?

18:53.429 --> 18:55.095
I'm thinking it
was business.

18:59.434 --> 19:03.969
The Law teaches
the vanity of this body.

19:03.971 --> 19:06.371
If I must bear all venom,
pain and spite,

19:06.373 --> 19:10.508
I will advance in my practices
with energetic spirit

19:10.510 --> 19:12.243
until the end,

19:12.245 --> 19:15.212
and I will rue none of it.

19:22.921 --> 19:24.052
(sighs)

19:27.524 --> 19:29.590
(sighs)

19:49.244 --> 19:50.960
Hey.

19:50.961 --> 19:52.677
You remember when I told you
about my grandparents?

19:54.682 --> 19:57.349
How much I admired their
love for one another?

19:57.351 --> 19:59.417
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:59.419 --> 20:00.718
Well, what I didn't tell you

20:00.720 --> 20:02.986
was how things started
out between them.

20:06.124 --> 20:08.023
The day after their
wedding, my grandfather

20:08.025 --> 20:10.492
was drafted into the Japanese
navy and spent the next

20:10.494 --> 20:12.594
three years on a ship

20:12.596 --> 20:16.030
while my grandmother waited
without any word from him.

20:16.032 --> 20:18.065
And neither of them
ever stopped believing

20:18.067 --> 20:20.133
they would be together.

20:21.269 --> 20:23.435
And you know the rest.

20:23.437 --> 20:25.303
They were married
for 60 years,

20:25.305 --> 20:27.305
had five children,
plenty of grandchildren.

20:27.307 --> 20:28.973
Mm-hmm.

20:30.109 --> 20:32.609
I want the same
for us, Kono.

20:33.745 --> 20:36.011
You just have to believe.

20:40.117 --> 20:42.550
I do.

20:42.552 --> 20:44.618
Good.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.227
CHIN: Hey. So CSU
finished processing

20:55.229 --> 20:57.729
the $100 bill we
recovered from the bar.

20:57.731 --> 21:00.498
No usable prints or DNA,
but the serial number

21:00.500 --> 21:02.633
came back to money stolen
in an armored car heist

21:02.635 --> 21:04.568
two days ago.
Three guys in ski masks

21:04.570 --> 21:06.202
hit a truck outside
a supermarket.

21:06.204 --> 21:08.170
Got away with $150K in cash.

21:08.172 --> 21:10.105
DANNY:
All right, so maybe

21:10.107 --> 21:11.739
Ben got tired of carrying
his brother's water,

21:11.741 --> 21:14.108
found a way to make some more money.
Yeah, except when it was time

21:14.110 --> 21:17.377
to split the cash, they decided
he wasn't part of the equation.

21:17.379 --> 21:18.778
(grunts)

21:25.319 --> 21:26.785
GROVER:
<i> CSU was able to trace</i>

21:26.787 --> 21:29.020
the print on the bottle
back to this guy.

21:29.022 --> 21:32.023
Juru Katsu.
He's a Halawa graduate.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.791
He was in there for
extortion, robbery, assault.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.726
The usual.
The bartender

21:35.728 --> 21:38.028
at The Coral Point
bar said that

21:38.030 --> 21:40.230
she I.D.'d him as being
there last night.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.098
He was one of the guys
who left with Ben,

21:42.100 --> 21:45.334
but that's not the most
interesting thing about him.

21:45.336 --> 21:49.071
FBI database has him
as a known associate

21:49.073 --> 21:52.474
of our old and dear friend
Gabriel Waincroft.

21:52.476 --> 21:53.775
He and Mr. Waincroft

21:53.777 --> 21:55.109
were both indicted,

21:55.111 --> 21:56.543
along with 12
other people,

21:56.545 --> 21:59.078
on a RICO case in 2005.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.612
But eventually the
government's case fell apart

22:00.614 --> 22:02.347
when the main witness
was found murdered.

22:02.349 --> 22:03.514
All right, well,
it's no coincidence

22:03.516 --> 22:05.082
that Gabriel's name
is popping up now.

22:05.084 --> 22:06.349
I don't think
so, either.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.117
I think
he's probably got his fingers

22:08.119 --> 22:09.485
in that armored car heist.

22:09.487 --> 22:13.822
$150,000 split four ways

No, I agree with Danny.

22:15.692 --> 22:16.824
This isn't about money.

22:16.826 --> 22:18.559
Gabriel's got lots
of other plays.

I'll talk! I'll talk! I'll tell
you what you want to know!

23:25.846 --> 23:29.647
Gabriel had nothing to do
with the armored car heist.

23:29.649 --> 23:32.116
And neither
did Ben.

23:32.118 --> 23:34.718
Okay, so
how do you know Ben?

23:34.720 --> 23:37.787
We spent some time
together in Halawa.

Relax, Juru.

23:51.467 --> 23:54.334
No one's gonna hurt you.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.369
I need a favor.

24:00.140 --> 24:03.574
A very important favor.

24:03.576 --> 24:06.209
He wanted me to find Ben,

24:06.211 --> 24:08.211
offer him $50K

24:08.213 --> 24:10.479

Well, $50,000

a pretty good deal.

end up dead?

24:24.191 --> 24:26.624
He wasn't down with it.

24:26.626 --> 24:28.726
He was even a little insulted
that I asked.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.578
Said he wouldn't let anyone do

24:30.579 --> 24:32.429
anything that would jeopardize
his brother's shot at a title.

24:32.431 --> 24:34.864
All right, so what?
So you beat him to death?

24:36.834 --> 24:39.467
That... that wasn't the plan.

24:41.404 --> 24:44.571
Gabriel gave me two choices.

Pay him for the pass

24:46.575 --> 24:49.742

If I knew where he was,
I'd tell you.

I'm a dead man.

25:07.524 --> 25:09.557
All right, Ben was killed

special access to the fight

29:12.647 --> 29:15.514
All right, Abby, I need you

29:16.884 --> 29:18.016

29:18.018 --> 29:19.784
Chin, I need you up top,

29:19.786 --> 29:21.118
If there was a
long gun in that bag

29:21.120 --> 29:22.903
they carried in here,
they're gonna be

29:22.904 --> 29:24.687
looking for a sniper's perch,
and we need to find it.

29:24.690 --> 29:26.423
Copy.
Danny, you, me

29:26.425 --> 29:28.124

the potential targets.

29:28.126 --> 29:29.425
Now, Gabriel's men
are gonna be watching,

29:29.427 --> 29:30.726

29:32.796 --> 29:34.695
ANNOUNCER:
A devastating left hook!

29:34.697 --> 29:36.530
Down goes Nakano!

29:36.532 --> 29:38.054
This could be it!
Go to your corner!

CROWD (chanting):
Luke! Luke! Luke! Luke!

29:39.578 --> 29:41.100

down on one knee. One!

29:41.103 --> 29:42.502

Two.

This is for the championship.
Get up, baby.

You can do it.

30:03.586 --> 30:05.052
REFEREE:

30:08.524 --> 30:10.524

is mocking the crowd

with his version of the hula dance.
REFEREE: Five!

30:12.761 --> 30:15.094
It's this type
of brazen behavior

30:15.096 --> 30:18.163
that fans here were hoping
Luke Nakano would

30:18.165 --> 30:19.164
put to an end tonight.
Six!

30:19.166 --> 30:22.167
Nakano is back up on his feet!

30:22.169 --> 30:25.536
(crowd cheering)

30:28.007 --> 30:30.207
The referee checks him
to see if he wants to continue.

30:30.209 --> 30:32.175
He does.

30:32.177 --> 30:34.010
All right, you ready?
ANNOUNCER: You have to wonder,

30:34.012 --> 30:36.045
how much longer will his corner
allow him to take this pounding.

30:36.047 --> 30:38.247
Fight!
(bell clangs)

30:38.248 --> 30:40.448
Nakano charges forward,
lands a solid combination.

30:40.451 --> 30:42.017
Haynes counters, missing with
a right and then a left.

30:42.019 --> 30:43.885
Nakano comes upstairs,
connects with a solid left hand.

30:43.887 --> 30:46.721
And for the first time
in this fight,

30:46.723 --> 30:49.056
the challenger looks like
he might belong in the ring

30:49.058 --> 30:49.990
with the champ.

30:49.992 --> 30:51.491
Yeah!

30:56.831 --> 30:58.964

31:00.834 --> 31:02.701
We may have a fight
on our hands.

31:02.703 --> 31:04.569
Something happened
at the end of that round.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.903
Maybe it was
Haynes taunting the crowd,

31:05.905 --> 31:09.039
or maybe Luke is
just tired of getting hit.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.541
Whatever it is,
Nakano looks like

31:11.543 --> 31:13.843
a different fighter
than we saw down on one knee

31:13.845 --> 31:14.944
in the last round.

31:14.946 --> 31:16.779
Haynes' corner has to be
a bit concerned.

31:16.781 --> 31:19.581
Excuse me. Where are the guys
that were sitting here?

31:19.583 --> 31:20.982
ANNOUNCER: But it looks
like Luke may have

31:20.984 --> 31:23.050
found the momentum.

31:29.124 --> 31:31.524
Round five gets under way
in just a few moments.

the alarm

I'm heading up.

31:50.273 --> 31:52.006

out of his corner.

31:53.943 --> 31:56.677
Nakano lands
a big right uppercut!

31:56.679 --> 31:59.212
That definitely got
Haynes's attention.

32:00.815 --> 32:02.548
Grover, go up aisle 17.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.683
