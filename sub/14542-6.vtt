Monroe: Previously on Revolution...

00:04.680 --> 00:06.114
We're working for the Patriots.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.792
- We'll keep you close.
- What about my son?

00:08.960 --> 00:11.190
Well, we have
a very special plan for him.

00:12.120 --> 00:13.793
Secretary Allenford, acting command.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.550
(GRUNTS)

00:18.400 --> 00:20.277
- Good luck, lady.
- You can't leave me here.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.238
- My apologies.
- It's your son.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.789
They've got him
at the reprogramming center.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.230
I'll take you there
if you get me out of here.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.039
- Miles.
- Charlie.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.196
<i>Charlie: Come with me.
I want to show you something first.</i>

00:35.800 --> 00:37.359
Miles: I don't want your help, Bass.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.636
You can't do this alone.
You need me.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.710
<i>Miles: Those are the Texas Rangers.</i>

00:41.880 --> 00:43.757
Director Edward Truman
with the US government.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.240
Well, I'm John Franklin Fry,

00:45.440 --> 00:47.829
Secretary of the Interior
of the great nation of Texas.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.593
- He's our best shot.
- At what?

00:49.760 --> 00:51.353
Starting a war with the Patriots.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.158
- Bass: They're invading.
- I need proof.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.316
You got to come alone.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.515
(GUN FIRES)

00:56.840 --> 00:59.434
<i>Bass: All we got to do now is
frame the Patriots for this.</i>

00:59.600 --> 01:01.113
Texas is gonna go nuts.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.550
What's up?

01:38.720 --> 01:41.314
It's Fry. He's MIA.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.073
I can't find him anywhere.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.390
(RIVER FLOWING)

02:12.080 --> 02:13.195
Evening.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.194
Well, Cynthia's
probably worried sick.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.751
Thank you
for a truly horrific evening.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.557
(DOOR OPENS)

02:46.560 --> 02:47.277
Rachel?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.478
Where the hell have you been?

02:56.960 --> 02:58.758
- Charlie.
- Hey, Grandpa.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.039
Man: Fry's tracks led here.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.355
Got something!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.229
Shell's one of theirs.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.593
Came from a Patriot gun.

Son of a bitches.

(LOW WHISTLE)

04:05.400 --> 04:06.799
Hey, over here!

04:28.560 --> 04:30.198
Wound matches, too.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.920
I say we ride for Willoughby,

04:33.120 --> 04:34.872
slaughter every last one
of those Patriots.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.959
If this is what I think it is,
we got to do this right.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.236
Yah! Come on.
(HORSES WHINNYING)

04:44.880 --> 04:45.870
Told you it would work.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.549
You wanted a war.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.029
You got one.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.473
Charlie, please pass the milk.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.879
You bet, Mom.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.112
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Of course.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.591
Enough.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.519
You keep this act up,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.199
What do you mean?

05:27.360 --> 05:29.192
This.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.634
What is with you two?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.353
Fake-grinning your way
through whatever's going on.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.634
- Everything's fine, Grandpa.
- Like hell!

05:42.000 --> 05:44.355
Your daughter is back.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.238
You should be happy.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.515
Both of you.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.309
Something's up.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.596
Now, you two want
to tell me what?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.235
I got to go.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.714
Aw, come on!

06:16.760 --> 06:18.956
- You got to be kidding me.
- He was out on patrol.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.599
I just wanted to sit him
down for a little chat, okay?

06:20.760 --> 06:21.830
No one saw me.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.194
Are you stupid?

06:24.720 --> 06:25.676
The plan was to lay low,

06:25.840 --> 06:28.832
wait for Texas to start
killing Patriots, not you.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.070
By the way, where's Texas?

06:30.280 --> 06:31.873
Just relax, all right?
They're on their way.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.759
It worked.
Till then, here you go.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.311
What is this?

06:37.480 --> 06:40.393
That's base coordinates,
personnel rosters, target cities...

06:40.560 --> 06:42.358
This guy sang like a bird.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.920
- This is pretty good.
- Yeah, there you go. Huh?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.518
How about a thank you?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.275
No? All right.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.192
I dug a hole around back.
Grab his legs.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.759
That's if you can, stumpy.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.238
You know, I was thinking.
I really hate the son of a bitch,

07:01.440 --> 07:03.272
but you know who'd be
handy against these guys?

07:05.600 --> 07:06.715
Tom Neville.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.231
All right.
This is as far as I go.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.834
Your son is about
two hours that way.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.630
The deal was you help me get him,

07:18.800 --> 07:21.713
not point in a vague direction.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.599
The reprogramming center
should scare you.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.239
It scares me.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.550
I'm not getting
any closer than I have to.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.313
When I lay eyes on him...

07:36.400 --> 07:38.596
...then you're free to go.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.315
(FLIES BUZZING)

08:02.800 --> 08:04.950
(GASPS)
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.078
- Just hold on.
- No! This is a field exercise.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.197
Sent out to hunt and kill
whoever they find,

08:10.360 --> 08:12.749
- no questions asked.
- What are you saying?

08:12.920 --> 08:14.877
The cadets from the center,
they did this.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.951
These people look like
they were ripped apart by wolves.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.314
That's what the cadets are,
at this point.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.838
Patriot special ops.
This is their boot camp.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.435
More like Hitler youth on meth.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.318
That, too.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.596
What kind of crazy-ass game
are you people running?

08:32.919 --> 08:34.592
They're not my people anymore.

Is he hanging in there?

09:39.760 --> 09:42.149
Hey, come on in.
Make yourself at home.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.392
Does he need anything
hot lunch, cold beer?

09:49.320 --> 09:52.551
- What do you want me to do?
- Something. Anything.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.597
There is a monster in our backyard,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.558
and you're not doing
a damn thing about it.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.313
(DRY CHUCKLE)
No.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.033
Actually, you're bringing him lunch.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.076
He got more intel off
one of their guys in two hours

10:08.240 --> 10:10.436
than we've been able to get in days.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.631
Am I supposed to be impressed?

10:18.120 --> 10:19.440
That he can torture people?

10:19.600 --> 10:22.797
The Patriots are smart.
They're vicious.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.031
They got you on a wanted poster,
God knows why.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.759
This is what we need!

10:27.920 --> 10:30.514
We need somebody
who's willing to do this.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.916
'Cause if he doesn't do it,
I'm gonna have to.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.593
I think you're full of crap.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.957
(GRUNTING)

11:25.360 --> 11:26.634
Haul him up.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.873
On behalf of the

11:32.080 --> 11:34.196
and the sovereign nation of Texas,

you are under arrest.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.875
What's going on?

12:20.120 --> 12:24.079
That's Texas...
and the Patriots together.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.714
Not killing each other.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.715
I... I got nothing.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.955
As Commander in Chief
of this fine nation,

12:57.120 --> 13:00.511
I can't tell you how proud
I am of today's operation.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.235
I'm especially proud of my friend,

13:04.400 --> 13:06.960
Texas ranger Malcolm Dove.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.634
(CROWD CHEERING)

with our new friends

13:26.600 --> 13:29.319
from the new
United States government,

13:29.480 --> 13:33.155

for his numerous crimes.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.630
And if found guilty
by the power of Texas law,

14:00.800 --> 14:02.791
he won't live to see
another sunrise.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.792

14:18.680 --> 14:20.796
It's your comic.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.035
What's it about?

14:23.520 --> 14:26.831
Uh... It's about this guy

14:27.000 --> 14:29.276
who can torch things.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.750
Let me guess, you are single.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.038
No, actually.
This is research.

Bonnie Webster.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.955
And you're Aaron Pittman.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.031
Before the blackout,
I worked at Forbes,

14:46.200 --> 14:49.033
and you were on the cover
of our "30 Under 30" issue.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.356
It was back in 'O9, I think?

14:53.040 --> 14:56.158
- Good times.
- Yeah.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.676
So you're with this circus
that just rolled in?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.194
Yeah, yeah.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.351
I'm with General Carver's
press corps.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.193
- Press?
- Mm-hm.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.033
Wait, since when is there press?

15:07.200 --> 15:09.191
In Austin, there is.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.351
Politicians enjoy
reading about themselves.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.517
So shouldn't you be out there?

15:14.720 --> 15:17.439
Nah. I wrote the story.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.432
General Carver - Texas hero.
He caught his Bin Laden.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.150
That'll keep him comfy, fellated,
and in power for years.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.200
I'm a writer, Aaron.
The truth isn't my business.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.550
My job is to make
heroes and villains.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.314
And today, we are making them
in Willoughby.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.075
I count ten,
maybe 12 guards out front.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.230
Five or six in back.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.710
It's too many.
You sure about this?

15:47.960 --> 15:50.634
Now that Texas is
dry-humping the Patriots?

15:50.840 --> 15:53.719
No way we can win without him.
We got to get him out.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.831
- No, we're not doing it, Miles.
- So you're good with starving then?

16:15.400 --> 16:16.674
Winter's right around the corner.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.354
You're talking about
stealing another camp's food.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.638
We scouted ten head of cattle,
maybe a couple dozen guns.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.199
You scouted?
What, are we an army now, Miles?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.789
Hey, you want to survive?
Maybe we have to be, yeah.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.911
You got to stop thinking so hard.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.957
- You're gonna stain your pants.
- Look, Bass.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.554
Just drop it, all right?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.433
Go and find yourself a girl.

16:39.960 --> 16:40.995
Hey, you.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.720
(SIGHING)
Hey.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.835
I know that sigh.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.990
You've had to deal
with Miles all clay.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.798
I am begging you, Shelly.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.997
Let's just talk about
anything else.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.878
Please.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.189
Sure.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.312
What should we name it?

17:24.520 --> 17:26.909
They won't stop until we're dead.
You know that, right?

17:28.119 --> 17:30.191
So you expect me to kill my son?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.038
He's not your son.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.397
- Not anymore.
- What makes you so sure?

17:41.200 --> 17:43.032
I've been through this
with my own boy.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.749
Years ago, he was
in a similar program.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.630
In Cuba.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.480
They've been perfecting
this training for years.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.870
(WHISPERING)
So after all of that,

17:57.040 --> 17:58.917
you still stayed with these people?

18:01.200 --> 18:03.032
(CRYING)
I had no choice.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.032
My husband is
Patriot High Command.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.873
You think he knows

18:12.040 --> 18:13.599
what you're going
through right now?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.876
Oh, yes. I do.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.237
Country before family.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.277
Tom, they shattered my baby.

18:28.080 --> 18:31.789
And then they built him
back up into their own image.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.559
He's an officer now.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.394
Sure, he wears
a convincing mask.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.473
Smiles sometimes,
pretending to be human.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.195
But he's not the same.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.192
He'll never be the same.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.749
I am going to get
my son out of this.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.434
I don't care what it takes.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.749
Tom, listen to me.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.038
This will only end one of two ways:

19:00.240 --> 19:04.120
either you kill him,
or he kills us.

19:13.440 --> 19:16.193
Monroe. On your feet.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.198
They're moving him. To the bank.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.475
Why the bank?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.631
Because it's got a damn vault.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.234
So how are we gonna
get him out?

19:41.400 --> 19:43.471
We're not.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.789
Only one way in or out.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.837
They're gonna guard that
with every guy they got.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.553
Jailbreak's one thing, Charlie,
but bank job?

19:53.720 --> 19:55.279
No. No way.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.315
It doesn't make any sense.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.471
Why would they move him
all of a sudden?

20:06.320 --> 20:08.277
(DOOR OPENING)

20:11.680 --> 20:12.829
Rachel...

20:13.840 --> 20:14.910
Did you do it?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.354
Did I do what?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.994
Oh, you know,
tip them off to a jailbreak?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.239
Damn right I did.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.914
Did you narc him out
in the first place?

20:28.120 --> 20:29.235
No.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.315
I didn't.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.509
But now that they have him,
he's not getting away.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.035
Well, that's it.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.873
I don't know
how to save this town

20:41.040 --> 20:42.678
from the Patriots or anybody else.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.110
So when you figure it out,
you let me know.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.434
If they had caught you,

20:51.640 --> 20:54.553
they would've put
a bullet in your head.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.475
I am not losing
another child to that man.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.676
If you really cared about me,

21:01.840 --> 21:03.160
then you would've
asked me just once

21:03.360 --> 21:05.237
how I've been this whole time.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.190
For one thing, I almost died.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.073
You know who saved me?

21:13.080 --> 21:14.753
Monroe.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.712
But you don't want
to hear that, do you?

21:19.160 --> 21:21.276
That's the thing.
You don't listen.

21:22.560 --> 21:23.880
Never have.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.996
Because you're smarter
than everybody else.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.071
And you're always right.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.398
Even when you're dead wrong.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.590
Man: And by the power vested in me

21:44.760 --> 21:46.910
by the sovereign
nation of Texas,

21:47.080 --> 21:51.597
I hereby sentence you to die

gave me one last request, and I...

26:47.680 --> 26:49.000
I asked for you.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.996
And why exactly
would you want to see

26:55.160 --> 26:57.390
local nobody Stu Redman?

You really think if these

At the end of the day,
that's exactly what this is.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.834
We were friends.

and Emma were still...

But it happened.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.873
I've got a son out there.

I've never met him.

Yeah, I knew about him.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.153

And I hid him from you.

How could you do that?

he tracked down Monroe.
