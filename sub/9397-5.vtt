00:00.920 --> 00:02.638
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.719 --> 00:05.234
Well, well, well. Mayor Mullins.

00:05.320 --> 00:08.915
You drop your bid for re-election.
You're gonna endorse me for mayor.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.675
Look, I don't want to be curious about you,
but I can't help it. I am.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.593
Well, selfishly, I'm glad
that's one battle you're losing.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.033
I'm just scared.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.873
Haley's really hurting, Nathan.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.315
She hasn't written a song
since you guys split up.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.630
So what can Chris Keller do for you?

00:23.720 --> 00:25.790
He can help Haley with her music.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.039
You want to dance?

00:28.120 --> 00:30.918
- Unless you're seeing someone.
- No.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.558
Not exclusively.

<i>Is everybody ready for Midnight Madness?</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:29.036
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

01:29.400 --> 01:31.960
<i>The countdown to the start</i>
<i>of the season is on!</i>

01:32.040 --> 01:33.359
<i>Let me hear you!</i>

01:33.480 --> 01:38.270
Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

01:38.800 --> 01:40.870
<i>Let the madness begin!</i>

02:16.040 --> 02:18.793
So are you gonna tell me
what's going on with Haley?

02:18.880 --> 02:20.518
You're breaking her heart,
and you know that.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.036
Lucas, this is a pep rally.
Where's your pep?

02:35.120 --> 02:36.439
She's your wife!

02:36.600 --> 02:39.353
You treat her like this, manipulating her,
pushing her back to Chris!

02:39.440 --> 02:41.556
All right, you need to back up. Now.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.279
Really? Is that an order, Captain?

02:44.360 --> 02:46.157
- Don't push me, bitch.
- Why?

02:46.240 --> 02:48.674
You gonna do something about it?
You're a coward.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.479
You love Haley,
but instead of dealing with it,

02:51.560 --> 02:53.949
you avoid her, treat her like dirt.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.795
God, I used to wonder why you did it,
and then I realized something.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.272
You're just like Dan.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.157
<i>Now, the team</i>
<i>that's gonna deliver us our state title,</i>

03:07.240 --> 03:09.470
<i>your Tree Hill Ravens!</i>

03:20.880 --> 03:23.110
Damn your sperm, Danny.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.793
Lucas Scott throws a roundhouse
to Nathan Scott's jaw.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.633
It's just past 12:00
and all hell's broken loose!

03:34.160 --> 03:37.470
Now this is truly Midnight Madness!

03:44.240 --> 03:45.673
Announcer tryouts for the season.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.228
First official practice, midnight, Friday.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.794
Whatever.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.913
Hey, I was hoping I'd catch you.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.595
- Why is that?
- I don't know, I think we should talk.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.908
About what?

04:11.440 --> 04:14.273
About what happened the other night
at the masquerade ball.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.351
I can't, Whitey wants
to see me before class.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.870
- But it wasn't that big of a deal, anyway.
- It was to me.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.639
It was a nice moment, Haley,
but it's over now.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.194
I gotta go.

04:30.560 --> 04:31.595
You know what hit me today?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.636
These are our last
cheerleader tryouts ever.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.597
Yeah, I'm really broken up about it.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.240
Come on,
how can you not love tryout day?

04:38.320 --> 04:42.108
Just the smell of it.
Like sports bras and desperation.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.669
Speaking of desperate,

04:43.760 --> 04:46.115
how's life in the
non-exclusive dating world?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.397
- Lucas isn't playing fair.
- Maybe he's not playing at all.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.596
Exactly. I mean,
unless you count him dancing

04:51.680 --> 04:55.468
with that slut at the masquerade ball,
he's been totally monogamous.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.313
He knows the rules.
Why can't he just follow them?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.719
Brooke, when are you gonna quit this crap

04:59.800 --> 05:02.758
and accept the fact that a really
great guy wants to be with you?

05:02.840 --> 05:05.593
Nothing good can come of this, okay?
What are you gonna do?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.148
Force Lucas to go out
and see other people?

05:09.640 --> 05:13.030
- P. Sawyer, you are a genius.
- Okay, that is not what I meant.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.034
Is this where we go for cheer tryouts?

05:17.480 --> 05:19.357
What tipped you off?

05:21.080 --> 05:22.593
Go Ravens!

05:22.680 --> 05:23.954
We have spirit!

05:31.040 --> 05:32.268
Yeah, go team!

05:33.680 --> 05:36.592
Let's go Ravens.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.991
What, what, what, what.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.230
A what-what-what.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.476
Do it, do it, let's go.

05:52.640 --> 05:56.269
T.H.S. Is number one, yell "go"!

05:56.520 --> 06:00.672
T.H.S. Is number one. Big blue!

06:01.280 --> 06:04.113
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I'm fine.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.795
Seriously, I'm fine,
but does this mean I didn't get it?

06:08.560 --> 06:10.516
What part of this
were we gonna miss again?

06:10.600 --> 06:13.319
One spot on the team
and there's no one to fill it?

06:13.400 --> 06:16.278
It was like dance auditions
for <i>Crap, The Musical.</i>

06:17.960 --> 06:20.030
Sorry, am I too late? I got lost.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.395
This new campus is totally confusing.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.549
I'm Rachel, by the way.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.790
Really? I thought it was Pamela.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.711
Oh, right. The party.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.109
That guy wasn't your boyfriend, was he?

06:31.720 --> 06:35.235
Okay, you were late,
now you're just wasting my time.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.117
Just hit your mark and I'll start the song.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.111
I actually brought my own song.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.238
Whenever you're ready.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.913
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of myself and the group,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.592
and I hope we pass the audition.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.591
- I'm sorry, what?
- John Lennon.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.038
The <i>Let It Be</i> album.
Girl knows her music.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.319
Too bad she was late.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.393
Sorry, Betty, was it? We'll be in touch.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.550
It's Rachel, and I hope so.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.437
So, I guess we found our girl, right?

08:11.520 --> 08:13.829
Oh, you just like her
'cause of that stupid Bee Gees thing.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.559
No, I like her because she's good.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.198
- You wanted to see me, Coach?
- Nathan, good timing.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.595
Look at this, triangle offense.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.039
It all runs through to you.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.475
- I'm ready, Coach.
- I know you are.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.628
You know,
it might not come as a surprise,

08:33.080 --> 08:34.717
but I'm making it official.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.792
I'm making you captain
of this year's squad.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.953
- I don't know what to say.
- There's nothing to say. You've earned it.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.630
Well, in that case,
I promise to do whatever I can

08:44.720 --> 08:46.312
to get you that championship.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.870
Nathan, I appreciate that,
but if we get that far,

08:50.080 --> 08:52.913
that trophy belongs to the team,
it's not mine.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.388
Team unity.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.829
That's the captain's responsibility.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.953
So I've been thinking
about our whole "non-exclusive" thing

09:06.040 --> 09:09.077
and about how you haven't been holding
up your end of the bargain.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.878
I didn't know it was a requirement.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.997
Lucas, in order for this to work,
there has to be a balance.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.277
I kiss a guy, you kiss a girl.
I kiss two guys...

09:17.360 --> 09:19.999
- I kiss you twice.
- You kiss someone else.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.715
Which is why I'm gonna pick a girl for you.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.234
Say, somebody like her.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.838
Okay. Go ask her out. Go on.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.348
- Really? You want me to ask her out?
- Yeah.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.354
- You're sure?
- I'm sure. She's the one.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.912
Okay, if you insist.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.316
- Want that autographed?
- God.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.436
I knew you'd be happy to see me.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.196
So, how's married life?

10:11.280 --> 10:12.998
What are you doing here, Chris?

10:13.080 --> 10:16.709
Truthfully, I was thinking,
you and me should work together again.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.835
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on, you know Chris Keller...

10:20.920 --> 10:21.989
Sorry.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.675
Haley, you and I
made great music together.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.749
- Remember?
- Yeah!

10:26.840 --> 10:28.796
I remember exactly what happened.
Do you?

10:28.880 --> 10:32.031
Yeah, so things weren't always easy,
but if you just set that other crap aside...

10:32.120 --> 10:34.076
That other crap was my marriage, Chris.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.513
Details, Haley.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.268
Come on. Me and you. Just music.

10:41.440 --> 10:42.714
What do you say?

10:46.640 --> 10:49.108
- She said no?
- Among other things.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.430
The girl has a real potty mouth
when she wants to.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.512
So you just gave up?
I mean, you didn't so easily last time.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.434
Whoa, whoa, that's unfair.
And entirely correct.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.354
Listen, you know I don't like to get in
the middle of other people's relationships.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.839
But Haley wants you, man. I don't get it.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.115
Why is it so important to you
that she and I work together?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.679
I have my reasons.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.876
And you wanna share them with me?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.190
Haley's music was a big part of her life.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.599
Without it, she's just not Haley.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.398
So what, she gets her music back,
you get her back?

11:18.480 --> 11:21.278
No, it's not about that. This is about Haley.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.920
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
She's not gonna go for it.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.788
- We'll see about that.
- Whatever you say.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.191
So, we'd make a pretty good team,
you and me.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.191
- Team? You and me?
- What?

11:33.280 --> 11:36.636
You don't think I got game? Come on.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.874
Come on.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.035
How do you know I wasn't aiming there?

11:47.400 --> 11:48.719
See you, partner.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.432
He's running for mayor?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.678
That conniving skunk.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.474
Do you realize the amount
of control the mayor has?

12:02.560 --> 12:04.471
The police department,
the zoning commission,

12:04.560 --> 12:07.154
not to mention veto power
over city council.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.231
I was going to tell you, Karen.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.715
To be honest, when Dan first
brought it up, I thought he was joking.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.438
I mean, he's running unopposed.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.637
Well, then we're gonna have
to find somebody who can beat him.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.633
You know, I'd love to help,
but my hands are tied.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.198
I made a deal with the devil that
I'd stand by his side through this election.

12:29.680 --> 12:32.672
- In exchange for what?
- A divorce.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.716
Freedom for Nathan, for me.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.829
Trust me, it was an offer
too good to refuse.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.955
Sure.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.714
You know,

12:41.120 --> 12:45.238
I can still make things difficult for him.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.678
The billboards look great.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.235
TV ads air next week.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.797
And thanks to a well-timed donation,

12:55.880 --> 12:59.919
the high school's generously agreed
to officially retire my jersey

13:00.000 --> 13:01.797
this Friday night at Midnight Madness.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.838
Which brings me to my platform,
"Family First."

13:04.920 --> 13:07.070
A return to traditional values.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.992
Safer streets, better schools.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.672
Neighborhood watch programs.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.910
A new and improved mass transit system.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.036
Parents as role models...

13:16.520 --> 13:19.751
I'm so sorry, Dan.
I didn't know we had company.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.951
Can you see my ass through this?

13:24.320 --> 13:26.709
Deb, honey, it's a little early
to be drinking, don't you think?

13:26.800 --> 13:29.314
Oh, come on, it's noon somewhere, right?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.189
Cheers.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.636
Okay, we're done.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.631
Do you see how the tendrils
frame her face?

13:44.720 --> 13:48.838
Oh, my God, I look so hot. Thanks, Rach.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.910
- God, you rock.
- No, Bev, you rock.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.556
- Hey, boyfriend.
- Hey.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.438
- Are we still on for tonight?
- Yeah, about that.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.353
Here's the thing,

14:06.760 --> 14:10.594
when I asked you out,
it was just to make Brooke jealous.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.268
I see.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.352
So, basically,
you just took advantage of the new girl.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.476
- Dude, that's just wrong.
- I'm sorry.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.551
Lucky for you, I'm into wrong.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.358
My address.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.193
Pick me up at 8:00.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.269
Yummy.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.749
Tomorrow's Midnight Madness,
so practice doesn't officially start till then.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.671
That doesn't mean
we can't get a head start.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.159
Aye aye, Captain!

14:56.880 --> 14:59.678
So, today,
we're gonna run full court, for thirty.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.995
- Captain Scott?
- It's just Nathan, Tim.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.719
Captain Nathan, has it occurred to you
to appoint a vice captain

15:05.800 --> 15:09.156
in the event that you're assassinated
or smash up another race car?

15:09.240 --> 15:11.629
No.
All right, I've already split up the teams,

15:11.720 --> 15:12.789
you guys know who you are.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.279
Everybody else just rotate in, all right?

15:14.360 --> 15:17.511
Yeah, about that,
I notice you've got both centers.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.591
How about we take Aero?

15:19.680 --> 15:20.715
That's a great idea, Lucas.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.268
Maybe when you're captain,
we can try that.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.554
In fact, why don't you just go ahead
and sit this one out, all right?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.434
- You're kidding.
- No.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.671
I'm captain, and if you
can't handle that, you can leave.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.994
Fede, you're in. Let's go.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.672
Did I miss the tryouts?

16:01.280 --> 16:03.316
Everyone missed the tryouts.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.796
- Why, are you interested?
- Uh-huh.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.110
- Okay, what's your name?
- Gigi.

16:08.200 --> 16:11.829
Okay, Gigi, do you have any
prior experience announcing basketball?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.553
I see, so you're just a big fan of the game.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.638
Gigi, you do realize
this is a job where you talk?

16:22.400 --> 16:23.833
About basketball.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.993
I'll be in touch.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.238
There you go. Thank you.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.078
You too, huh?

16:36.640 --> 16:40.952
Don't freak, I'm pretty sure taste
in coffee drinks isn't hereditary.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.911
I was hoping I'd run into you.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.992
I mean, considering you've been
lurking outside my motel room.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.513
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.398
It's okay. I would've come out
and offered you a soda.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.358
The last thing I wanna do
is complicate your life.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.831
Well, I probably better go.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.115
You know, there's this lunchtime concert.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.033
This guy doing ska covers
of Neil Diamond songs.

17:03.360 --> 17:07.272
- That sounds awful.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.398
- So you wanna check it out?
- Yeah.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.637
Okay, so wait. You're saying that you were
actually conceived at Woodstock.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.917
Well, that's what my parents say,
but their math's a little off.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.718
They were pretty big hippies, though.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.756
Got a picture of them somewhere.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.474
Bear in mind,
this was taken a while ago, but...

17:44.520 --> 17:45.748
Oh, God.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.229
- What the hell is this?
- It's an article I wrote.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.639
For what, <i>Lying Bitch Monthly?</i>

17:49.720 --> 17:51.836
- Peyton.
- You said you wanted to get to know me!

17:51.920 --> 17:54.832
- You said that there wasn't any article!
- There wasn't, at the time.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.990
You also said that you don't draw,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.833
but really, Ellie,
this looks a hell of a lot like me!

17:59.920 --> 18:02.229
If you would just listen, I can explain.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.719
You know what? Don't bother.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.713
In fact, I've got a headline for your article,
it's called, "Go to Hell."

18:15.720 --> 18:17.756
I just had a great idea!

18:17.840 --> 18:19.717
Does it involve trigonometry?

18:19.880 --> 18:21.711
I don't know what that is, so I doubt it.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.519
You are gonna be a cheerleader.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.194
- What?
- I know, it's sudden, right?

18:29.280 --> 18:32.431
But I was thinking, you did such a great
job filling in at last year's tournament

18:32.520 --> 18:35.159
that why not do the same thing this year,
only permanently.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.708
- Thanks, but I'll pass.
- Come on.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.075
You're my roommate.
You're supposed to have my back.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.913
That Rachel girl, she is stealing my life.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.993
She's dating Lucas, which,
okay, I accidentally orchestrated.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.435
But my entire squad
has a girl crush on her.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.636
Basically, if you do not cheer, I'm screwed.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.314
Brooke, I have a lot going on
in my life right now.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.995
Nathan's being all hot and cold
and now with Chris back in town...

18:59.000 --> 19:00.911
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.069
Oh, that's totally it.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.912
That's exactly why
Nathan's acting so weird.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.228
He knows Chris is back in town

19:05.320 --> 19:07.356
and he thinks I had
something to do with it.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.830
Oh, yeah, great. We've solved your riddle.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.797
Can we please get back to mine?
Give me an "H"!

19:12.880 --> 19:13.915
I can't!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.309
You can, and besides,
I thought your goal was to be with Nathan.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.994
You'd be with him all the time,
pep rallies, and away games...

19:19.080 --> 19:21.150
I know, I get it. I just...

19:21.240 --> 19:22.753
I think that if I join the cheerleading squad,

19:22.840 --> 19:26.116
Nathan would see it as some,
like, pathetic attempt to get close to him.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.235
That's funny.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.072
It seems to me like worrying
about what Nathan thinks

19:29.160 --> 19:31.071
is pathetic, is actually pretty pathetic.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.391
Forget about Nathan.
Why don't you do what you want for once?

19:34.480 --> 19:36.869
Okay, I will. No thanks.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.719
Let me rephrase that.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.758
Why don't you just do
what I want for once?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.357
Come on.

19:48.000 --> 19:48.989
Fine.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.831
Oh, did I mention that Nathan's
very often shirtless at practice?

19:53.920 --> 19:58.710
You know, taut and sweaty
and bulging in all the right places.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.672
All the girls notice.

20:02.640 --> 20:03.868
Okay, see you.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.359
You don't give up, do you?

20:35.440 --> 20:39.035
Peyton, I had to explain.
I couldn't leave things like that.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.830
Maybe if you'd just read the article.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.877
Fine. Come in, I've got something for you.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.713
I'm a writer, Peyton.
It's a big part of my life,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.712
but I never meant to hurt you
and the fact that you even think that...

20:58.800 --> 21:00.631
You wanna know what I think?

21:01.280 --> 21:05.193
I think you're just a lying junkie
who probably doesn't even have cancer.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.472
Oh, I see.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.633
So this relationship that we have,
if you can call it that,

21:18.720 --> 21:22.998
you can use it for your podcasts and
your drawings, but I can't write about it.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.711
Just get out, Ellie.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.918
Out of my house, out of my town
and out of my life.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.988
Okay.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.308
I will.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.118
But know this, Peyton.

21:42.680 --> 21:47.196
Your trust was always more important
to me than any article.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.637
You may not believe that,

21:53.160 --> 21:54.798
but it's the truth.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.719
Damn it, Dan! What are you doing?

22:18.320 --> 22:20.754
Oh, in the spirit of your
little fashion show earlier,

22:20.840 --> 22:22.592
I decided to take up photography.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.229
I call this exhibit, "Deb's Toothbrush."

22:27.000 --> 22:28.433
Let's see,

22:28.520 --> 22:33.310
here's me Armor Alling the tires,
with your toothbrush.

22:34.760 --> 22:36.830
Scrubbing the toilet.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.430
The neighbor's dog.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.154
Oh, and my favorite,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.993
here's your toothbrush up the dog's...

22:54.640 --> 22:58.713
So, basically, the plan is
to parade me around in front of Brooke,

22:58.800 --> 23:00.438
rubbing her nose in the fact
that you're out

23:00.520 --> 23:02.715
with an extremely hot girl who isn't her?

23:02.800 --> 23:04.836
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Cool.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.831
Just show me where she works.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.837
Oh, perfect timing.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.272
You think it's working?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.958
Oh, yeah, but we can do better.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.873
Whoa, I think this is a bad idea.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.715
Welcome to Suburban Filth,
can I help you?

23:27.800 --> 23:30.633
Yes, we're looking for some lingerie,

23:30.720 --> 23:32.915
something lacy,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.197
open cup, possibly edible.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.234
Okay, joke's over, Rachel, let's go.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.436
You know, I think you're
in the wrong store,

23:42.520 --> 23:45.717
you're looking for Slut Barn, downstairs.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.228
These will do.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.550
Oh, and I need a pair for my sister.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.030
She's kind of chubby, you know, your size.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.910
Either you take her out that door
or I'm gonna put her through the window.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.231
Okay, look, I'm sorry. I messed up.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.189
- But you're the one who told me to see...
- Now, Lucas!

24:08.680 --> 24:11.717
- Let's go, Rachel.
- Yeah, okay.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.912
Service here sucks donkeys, anyway.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.514
Hey!

24:38.600 --> 24:41.273
I'm... I wasn't expecting you. Come on in.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.152
I can't stay. I just...

24:44.240 --> 24:45.798
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.359
- Chris.
- How'd you know?

24:47.440 --> 24:50.193
Please, all this weirdness between us,
I just figured.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.510
Nathan, I didn't know
he was coming back into town.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.875
You have to believe me.
I would never work with him again.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.191
- Actually, I think you should.
- You what?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.199
He's good for your music, Haley,

25:00.280 --> 25:02.157
and that's what you should be
focusing on right now.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.152
Nathan, working with Chris
nearly killed our marriage.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.994
- Do you remember how jealous you were?
- Yeah, and that's just it.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.959
I told you I needed to be able
to trust you again.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.600
- This is your chance.
- So this is like a test?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.079
You can call it what you want,

25:16.160 --> 25:18.833
but if you work with Chris and you
end up having feelings for him again,

25:18.920 --> 25:20.114
I guess I'll have my answer.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.589
That's ridiculous! Nathan, that's not fair!

25:22.680 --> 25:27.037
Maybe not.
But like I said, it's your chance.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.597
Vote Dan Scott for mayor.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.159
Appreciate your vote.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.868
Vote for Dan Scott. Dan Scott for mayor.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.749
Hey, Nathan.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.958
- Big night, huh?
- Yeah.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.588
I see you've managed
to make it about yourself.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.557
Come on, son. Don't be jealous.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.517
It's unbecoming to a captain.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.952
And frankly, it makes you look like a tool.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.595
Nathan.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.918
- You okay?
- Yeah.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.389
My dad just ruins my life.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.950
Pretty soon he'll be mayor
and he can ruin everybody else's too.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.395
Here you go, Dan Scott for mayor.

27:06.800 --> 27:10.315
We go on in 10 minutes.
Where is everybody?

27:10.400 --> 27:12.960
Brooke, chill. They're gonna be here.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.918
Where the hell have you been?

27:18.000 --> 27:21.072
- You almost missed the routine.
- Sorry, Brooke.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.391
I treated the team
to a little preshow beverage.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.835
- Brought you one.
- No, thanks.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.593
- Brooke, relax. It's okay.
- No, it is not okay.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.675
First of all, this is my squad! Second...

27:37.520 --> 27:39.750
Bevin, where are your cheer bloomers?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.872
I'm trying something new.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.117
Okay, this squad is out of control
and it is your fault.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.237
- What are you gonna do, fire me?
- Hi.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.319
Nice outfit.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.959
Well then, that's it. Get out.

27:58.280 --> 28:00.555
- You can't be serious.
- Oh, it's real.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.596
Check your pompoms at the door.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.832
Well, I don't know what to say.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.196
- But, if that's what everyone wants...
- No.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.396
Brooke, Rachel's
the best cheerleader we've got.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.040
If we want a shot at state, we need her.

28:14.120 --> 28:18.511
Look, I make the rules and I say Haley's in!

28:18.600 --> 28:22.036
And, besides, the routine
won't even work with an extra person.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.873
- Sure it will. Won't it, girls?
- Yeah.

28:24.960 --> 28:29.636
I'll be up front and... Haley, is it?
Just watch me for the changes.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.110
Come on, girls. Let's go stretch.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.913
What?

28:37.800 --> 28:40.917
Okay, what the hell just happened?

28:45.280 --> 28:46.793
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.440
Mouth McFadden, coming to you
from the Tree Hill gym

28:49.520 --> 28:51.590
where in minutes,
perhaps the most promising team

28:51.680 --> 28:53.671
in Ravens history will take the floor.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.230
With me tonight is my
new color announcer, Gigi Silveri.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.073
Gigi, how would you describe
the excitement here?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.353
Okay, then.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.877
And Coach Whitey Durham
is stepping to center court.

29:10.120 --> 29:13.271
<i>Welcome to Midnight Madness!</i>

29:20.160 --> 29:21.388
<i>All right!</i>

29:21.920 --> 29:24.309
<i>I want to bring out</i>
<i>the cheerleaders in a minute.</i>

29:24.400 --> 29:28.598
<i>But first, we've got some</i>
<i>business we've got to tend to.</i>

29:28.760 --> 29:31.069
<i>Twenty years ago, we had a player,</i>

29:31.160 --> 29:33.628
<i>one of the most talented</i>
<i>I've ever coached.</i>

29:34.040 --> 29:37.191
<i>Dan Scott scored</i>
<i>a lot of points for this team,</i>

29:37.280 --> 29:38.998
<i>got a lot of rebounds.</i>

29:39.080 --> 29:42.197
<i>After that, he sold a lot of automobiles,</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:44.953
<i>and I'm sure, in the upcoming election,</i>

29:45.040 --> 29:47.156
<i>he's gonna get a lot of votes,</i>

29:48.320 --> 29:50.072
<i>just not mine.</i>

29:52.200 --> 29:53.792
<i>Dan, come up here.</i>

30:10.360 --> 30:13.352
<i>Whitey Durham, everybody. Class act.</i>

30:21.680 --> 30:23.750
<i>It's an honor to be here tonight.</i>

30:32.040 --> 30:35.271
<i>Looking around this gym</i>
<i>sure brings back a lot of memories.</i>

30:34.840 --> 30:36.671
<i>I played my heart out for those teams.</i>

30:39.600 --> 30:43.434
<i>And I plan to put forth</i>
<i>that same effort as your mayor.</i>

30:41.520 --> 30:44.910
Lord, Lord, where's Lee Harvey Oswald
when we need him?

30:45.440 --> 30:46.793
<i>And since I'm running unopposed,</i>

30:48.920 --> 30:52.390
<i>a vote for Dan Scott</i>
<i>is not only the smart choice,</i>

30:50.360 --> 30:52.032
<i>it's the only choice.</i>

30:55.080 --> 30:56.354
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:58.000 --> 31:00.878
<i>Thank you, Danny. That was a fine speech.</i>

31:06.040 --> 31:09.077
<i>However, you made one small error.</i>

31:09.040 --> 31:12.874
<i>I've just been told</i>
<i>you'll be running opposed after all.</i>

31:12.320 --> 31:15.835
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the candidate that I'm endorsing,</i>

31:16.440 --> 31:17.998
<i>Ms. Karen Roe.</i>

31:20.040 --> 31:25.034
<i>Is everybody ready for Midnight Madness?</i>

31:49.200 --> 31:51.236
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

31:54.640 --> 31:57.359
<i>The countdown to the start</i>
<i>of the season is on!</i>

31:57.240 --> 31:58.593
<i>Let me hear you!</i>

32:00.040 --> 32:04.716
Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

32:01.480 --> 32:03.710
<i>Let the madness begin!</i>

32:06.480 --> 32:09.472
Brooke Davis and the squad
already in mid-season form.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.515
And the newest cheerleaders,
Haley James-Scott and Rachel Gattina.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.633
Showtime.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.554
Don't push me, bitch!

32:41.960 --> 32:44.269
- Don't push me, bitch.
- Why, you gonna do something about it?

32:43.240 --> 32:44.912
I'm just getting started.

32:45.640 --> 32:49.155
Cool it! This isn't the pole dancing
you do on weekends!

32:56.920 --> 33:00.356
Well, the new girl sure has a lot of spirit.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.678
What is your problem!

33:22.520 --> 33:25.114
Say, you're the one with the problem!
You dance like a cripple.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.992
Nice splits though, you must have
a lot of practice spreading your legs.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.433
I also have a lot of practice making a fist.
Do you wanna see?

33:30.760 --> 33:32.352
Brooke, you don't scare me.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.558
I mean, it's not like
I'm a cookie or a donut.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.989
<i>Now, the team</i>
<i>that's gonna deliver us our state title.</i>

33:40.160 --> 33:42.515
You're just like Dan.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.076
<i>Your Tree Hill Ravens!</i>

33:50.440 --> 33:52.908
- What happened?
- Who knows?

34:00.560 --> 34:03.028
Maybe somebody was being
a full on diva skank.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.269
You'd know.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.830
You just bought yourself a nose job.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.476
Let her go!

34:16.159 --> 34:19.152
Lucas Scott throws a roundhouse
to Nathan Scott's jaw.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.876
And over on the other side,
Brooke Davis is choking the new girl!

34:34.159 --> 34:36.549
There's a hair pull, oh, an eye gouge.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.114
Oh, and there's a painful shot to the groin!

34:40.480 --> 34:43.358
Now this is truly Midnight Madness!

34:43.159 --> 34:45.275
Gigi, I don't suppose
you have anything to add.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.748
Actually, this kind of turns me on!

34:48.560 --> 34:52.553
Never, in my 47 years of coaching,

35:03.400 --> 35:06.198
have I been so embarrassed
by my players!

35:07.720 --> 35:10.473
What in the hell
did I tell you about team unity?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.355
I'm sorry, Coach.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.559
I ought to come over there and rip
that captain's patch off that jersey!

35:17.880 --> 35:19.518
But I'm not gonna do it.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.035
I don't get it.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.236
I'm making you co-captains!

35:30.240 --> 35:34.677
God knows neither one of you deserve it,
but this is our last season,

35:32.440 --> 35:36.274
and you two are either
gonna make this work or tear it down!

35:37.320 --> 35:40.073
Either way, you're gonna do it together!

35:41.920 --> 35:43.797
So, what's the "C" stand for?

35:50.600 --> 35:55.037
'Cause if it's chastity,
I'm definitely in the wrong car.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.671
It's a crazy night, huh?

35:58.280 --> 36:00.669
I thought you might be up
for a little more fun.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.589
Rachel, I told you before.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.398
I get it, Lucas.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.993
You're using me and I'm okay with that.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.554
As long as you let me use you back a little.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.429
Please, naked in the backseat
is so last year,

36:18.600 --> 36:20.352
it's like, two years ago.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.229
Brooke!

36:26.440 --> 36:28.556
This isn't what it looks like.

36:27.800 --> 36:31.190
- Anyway, I don't get why you're so upset.
- You're kidding, right?

36:30.160 --> 36:31.912
You're the one who wanted
to be non-exclusive.

36:33.640 --> 36:36.359
- I'm just doing what you wanted.
- What I wanted?

36:35.480 --> 36:37.789
I wanted you to fight for me!

36:38.960 --> 36:42.635
I wanted you to say there is no one else
that you could ever be with

36:42.040 --> 36:45.032
and that you'd rather be alone
than without me.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.950
I wanted the Lucas Scott
from the beach that night,

36:49.360 --> 36:51.396
telling the world that he's the one for me.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.636
How was I supposed to know that?

36:53.720 --> 36:55.312
You just are.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.632
And one more thing.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.078
Don't ever hit me again.

37:10.920 --> 37:13.150
<i>"It's tough to get to know Peyton.</i>

37:39.680 --> 37:43.150
<i>"Like me, she tends</i>
<i>to keep the world at arm 's length,</i>

37:42.000 --> 37:45.037
<i>"but in those fleeting moments</i>
<i>she has let me in,</i>

37:45.560 --> 37:49.439
<i>"I've seen in her</i>
<i>such indomitable courage and heart,</i>

37:48.800 --> 37:52.475
<i>"a young woman anyone</i>
<i>would be proud to call her daughter. "</i>

37:52.760 --> 37:54.910
"Dan's the Man"?

38:02.320 --> 38:04.197
So you're running against me.

38:11.480 --> 38:15.314
Who would have thought,
18 years after I pick Deb over you.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.313
What's your point, Dan?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.550
The point is,
you came in second place then.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.719
What makes you think
it'd be any different now?

38:23.240 --> 38:24.673
Hi, guys.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.433
As you know,
I recently met my birth mother,

39:13.400 --> 39:15.231
and I really didn't like her.

39:16.720 --> 39:19.359
As a matter of fact, I drove her away,

39:18.640 --> 39:20.153
and now she's gone.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.670
But the part that really sucks...

39:26.800 --> 39:30.190
<i>You know that thing</i>
<i>about judging a book by its cover?</i>

39:29.960 --> 39:31.188
<i>It's true.</i>

39:33.440 --> 39:35.908
<i>Sometimes you gotta read the whole thing</i>

39:34.760 --> 39:37.911
<i>and, even then, you still might</i>
<i>not know the whole story.</i>

39:37.480 --> 39:40.790
Get your guitar,
and wipe that stupid smile off your face.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.714
