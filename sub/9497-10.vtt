<b>We have people over for Easter</b>

<b>Don't smile, you gotta be a tough guy.</b>

<b>Mary Ann: Horace!</b>

05:12.000 --> 05:13.709
<b>Where's Sylvia?</b>

05:13.792 --> 05:17.626
<b>- Um, she didn't come home last night.</b>

05:17.709 --> 05:19.250
<b>- She's out with that--</b>
<b>- No, she's out with Tina.</b>

05:19.334 --> 05:21.709
<b>I told her she could stay at her's.</b>

05:24.876 --> 05:28.000
<b>- What are you doing?</b>
<b>You're lying...</b>

05:28.083 --> 05:29.459
<b>Two times, it's 9:00.</b>

05:29.542 --> 05:31.250
<b>You already lied twice.</b>

05:31.334 --> 05:34.375
<b>Every time you open that mouth,</b>
<b>it's to lie.</b>

05:34.459 --> 05:37.209
<b>You brush your teeth, you're lying.</b>

05:37.292 --> 05:38.584
<b>The only time that mouth</b>
<b>of yours is not lying--</b>

05:38.667 --> 05:40.709
<b>- And sports fans, the funs begins.</b>

05:40.792 --> 05:42.959
<b>A classic matchup between Horace Wittel</b>

05:43.042 --> 05:46.083
<b>and his formidable opponent,</b>
<b>Mary Ann Wittel.</b>

05:46.167 --> 05:48.417
<b>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!</b>

05:48.501 --> 05:50.000
<b>Gotta go to my game.</b>

06:00.000 --> 06:02.334
<b>(Horace groans)</b>

06:02.417 --> 06:04.584
<b>- That sister of yours is a fucking snake.</b>

06:09.000 --> 06:12.375
<b>All you...</b>
<b>fucking broads are up to something.</b>

06:12.459 --> 06:13.501
<b>Go put some real clothes on.</b>

06:13.584 --> 06:15.083
<b>Go-- Get out of your</b>
<b>little baby jammies.</b>

06:15.167 --> 06:16.417
<b>- Iâm-- I'm not done with my breakfast.</b>
<b>- You had enough.</b>

06:16.501 --> 06:18.417
<b>You had enough.</b>

06:20.292 --> 06:22.876
<b>You dress him up like he's a--</b>
<b>Like a little teddy bear.</b>

06:22.959 --> 06:24.751
<b>Like a fag.</b>

06:28.417 --> 06:30.292
<b>Look at me.</b>
<b>Look at me.</b>

06:30.375 --> 06:32.959
<b>Look at me.</b>

06:33.042 --> 06:34.083
<b>Look at me.</b>

06:34.167 --> 06:35.250
<b>You're not going anywhere.</b>

06:35.334 --> 06:36.709
<b>You're staying right here.</b>

06:42.792 --> 06:44.250
<b>(muttering) Fucking...</b>

07:00.209 --> 07:03.292
<b>- Holy shit, it's hot out there today.</b>

07:03.375 --> 07:06.167
<b>It's hotter than a four-titted Mexican</b>
<b>woman on diarrhea.</b>

07:06.250 --> 07:07.292
<b>Holy shit.</b>

07:07.375 --> 07:10.375
<b>Then my truck breaks down,</b>
<b>overheats, and I said--</b>

07:10.459 --> 07:11.876
<b>I said fuck it.</b>

07:11.959 --> 07:14.250
<b>I just left it right there in the middle of the</b>
<b>fucking street.</b>

07:14.334 --> 07:16.083
<b>Then I come in here to get a beer</b>

07:16.167 --> 07:18.167
<b>and this shit is warmer than the shit</b>

07:18.250 --> 07:20.083
<b>that's running out</b>
<b>of my radiator.</b>

07:20.167 --> 07:23.000
<b>- Oh, fuck you, George.</b>
<b>Get out if you don't like it.</b>

07:23.083 --> 07:24.209
<b>- I don't like it.</b>

07:24.292 --> 07:28.167
<b>Why can't you fucking refrigerate your</b>
<b>beer like everybody else, Pete?</b>

07:28.250 --> 07:30.334
<b>- Because fuck you is why.</b>

07:30.417 --> 07:32.667
<b>I got all the machines downstairs to do it,</b>

07:32.751 --> 07:36.959
<b>but every time I go to turn it on, I think,</b>
<b>ah, fuck that black George.</b>

07:37.042 --> 07:41.667
<b>If you want to cool off, go find yourself</b>
<b>a big watermelon and climb inside.</b>

07:41.751 --> 07:42.792
<b>(woman giggles)</b>

07:42.876 --> 07:44.417
<b>Warm beer.</b>
<b>I'll give you warm beer.</b>

07:44.501 --> 07:47.292
<b>- And you did give me warm beer,</b>
<b>you Irish bastard.</b>

07:47.375 --> 07:49.834
<b>(woman laughing)</b>

07:51.459 --> 07:52.584
<b>The fuck you laughing at?</b>

07:52.667 --> 07:55.250
<b>- Nothing, Daddy.</b>

07:55.334 --> 07:57.292
<b>- You dumb, drunk bitches.</b>

07:57.375 --> 07:59.626
<b>What the--</b>
<b>Shut the fuck up!</b>

07:59.709 --> 08:03.584
<b>- Make me, then.</b>
<b>- Yeah, make her.</b>

08:03.667 --> 08:05.292
<b>- Just--</b>
<b>You know what?</b>

08:05.375 --> 08:08.542
<b>You take your lezzie friend somewhere</b>
<b>and y'all lick on each other's balls.</b>

08:08.626 --> 08:10.501
<b>Is that what y'all do?</b>
<b>- Hey, hey, hey!</b>

08:10.584 --> 08:11.626
<b>- Yeah, lick on each other's balls.</b>

08:11.709 --> 08:12.751
<b>- None of that in here.</b>

08:12.834 --> 08:13.918
<b>- None of what?</b>

08:14.000 --> 08:16.751
<b>- What are you laughing at?</b>
<b>- If you two are gonna...</b>

08:16.834 --> 08:19.417
<b>do that to each other,</b>
<b>just go somewhere else.</b>

08:19.501 --> 08:20.584
<b>- Hey, Jimmy.</b>
<b>- How you doing, Pete?</b>

08:20.667 --> 08:21.751
<b>What do you hear, what do you say?</b>

08:21.834 --> 08:22.876
<b>- Nothing.</b>
<b>Nothing.</b>

08:22.959 --> 08:24.167
<b>You want coffee?</b>

08:24.250 --> 08:25.667
<b>- Only your best, Pete.</b>

08:25.751 --> 08:28.959
<b>Nothing but your best coffee.</b>

08:29.042 --> 08:31.042
<b>Horace.</b>

08:31.125 --> 08:34.250
<b>How are you, Horace Sr.?</b>
<b>- Hi.</b>

08:34.333 --> 08:37.417
<b>- How you feeling,</b>
<b>still got both your kidneys?</b>

08:37.501 --> 08:40.167
<b>- One's fulled up.</b>
<b>I gotta empty out soon.</b>

08:40.250 --> 08:42.125
<b>One of my balls, you know.</b>

08:42.208 --> 08:45.167
<b>- Duly noted.</b>

08:45.250 --> 08:46.334
<b>- No school today?</b>

08:46.417 --> 08:49.834
<b>- No, it's Good Friday, Pete, you heathen.</b>

08:49.918 --> 08:52.542
<b>The students have to beat each</b>
<b>other up at home today.</b>

08:52.626 --> 08:54.042
<b>- Fucking animals.</b>

08:54.125 --> 08:55.167
<b>- They're all right.</b>

08:55.250 --> 08:57.167
<b>They just got too much</b>
<b>energy for a classroom,</b>

08:57.250 --> 08:58.959
<b>so once in a while,</b>
<b>they crack each other over</b>

08:59.042 --> 09:01.125
<b>the head with a fucking</b>
<b>Snoopy lunchbox.</b>

09:01.209 --> 09:04.042
<b>- Yeah, but I hear the gangs are</b>
<b>infiltrating the schools now.</b>

09:04.125 --> 09:05.542
<b>- Oh, my God, the gangs.</b>

09:05.626 --> 09:07.375
<b>I was in Coney Island the other day,</b>

09:07.459 --> 09:09.918
<b>I had my daughter for the weekend,</b>
<b>pick her up at her</b>

09:10.000 --> 09:11.584
<b>friend's house in Trump Village,</b>

09:11.667 --> 09:13.083
<b>take her to Coney Island, the boardwalk.</b>

09:13.167 --> 09:14.584
<b>We go on the Cyclone.</b>

09:14.667 --> 09:16.042
<b>She says, Daddy, it's boring.</b>

09:16.125 --> 09:17.667
<b>The Cyclone is boring now.</b>

09:17.751 --> 09:20.792
<b>So we're on the boardwalk,</b>
<b>ice cream, whatever.</b>

09:20.876 --> 09:22.751
<b>- You drink coffee in a bar?</b>

09:22.834 --> 09:24.250
<b>- Yes, ma'am.</b>

09:24.334 --> 09:26.792
<b>- Why the fuck would you come</b>
<b>to a bar to drink coffee?</b>

09:26.876 --> 09:28.334
<b>- Hey, shut up.</b>

09:28.417 --> 09:30.209
<b>Unless you want to get</b>
<b>the fuck out yourself.</b>

09:30.292 --> 09:33.125
<b>- You gonna kick me out just for asking</b>
<b>the man a question?</b>

09:33.209 --> 09:34.792
<b>- Yeah, Pete, it's all right,</b>
<b>it's a legitimate question.</b>

09:34.876 --> 09:36.250
<b>Why would I drink coffee in a bar?</b>

09:36.334 --> 09:39.083
<b>- Because he fucking likes it, okay?</b>

09:39.167 --> 09:42.083
<b>Because it's his fucking</b>
<b>business and not yours.</b>

09:42.167 --> 09:43.709
<b>Anyway, you're a degenerate lesbian.</b>

09:43.792 --> 09:45.375
<b>And...</b>

09:45.459 --> 09:47.709
<b>Jimmy here is an educated guy.</b>

09:47.792 --> 09:49.792
<b>So go fuck yourself.</b>

09:49.876 --> 09:52.292
<b>- I was gonna go with a more</b>
<b>diplomatic response,</b>

09:52.375 --> 09:56.459
<b>but it's Pete's bar, so I guess,</b>
<b>go fuck yourself is an order.</b>

09:56.542 --> 09:58.250
<b>Go fuck yourself, young lady.</b>

09:58.334 --> 10:00.417
<b>How dare you ask the teacher</b>
<b>a question?</b>

10:00.501 --> 10:01.542
<b>- Hey, Dad.</b>

10:01.626 --> 10:02.792
<b>You wanna go lay down?</b>

10:02.876 --> 10:04.417
<b>- What?</b>

10:04.501 --> 10:06.626
<b>- Why don't you go upstairs</b>
<b>and lie down for a minute?</b>

10:06.709 --> 10:08.125
<b>- What for?</b>

10:08.209 --> 10:10.167
<b>- Maybe you're tired,</b>
<b>maybe you want to lie down.</b>

10:10.250 --> 10:11.709
<b>- Iâm fine.</b>

10:11.792 --> 10:14.626
<b>- Iâm on the boardwalk,</b>
<b>me and my daughter.</b>

10:14.709 --> 10:15.751
<b>It's quiet.</b>

10:15.834 --> 10:19.000
<b>Suddenly, you hear "Homicides,</b>
<b>Homicides, Homicides."</b>

10:19.083 --> 10:21.959
<b>- Ooh, Homicides, the Homicides.</b>

10:22.042 --> 10:24.334
<b>- Worst gang in Brooklyn,</b>
<b>worst gang in Brooklyn.</b>

10:24.417 --> 10:27.209
<b>About 80 of them in their leathers</b>
<b>running right towards us.</b>

10:27.292 --> 10:29.417
<b>And they're yelling</b>
<b>"Homicides, Homicides."</b>

10:29.501 --> 10:31.626
<b>Iâm looking at my daughter like, is there</b>
<b>something you're not telling me?</b>

10:31.709 --> 10:34.125
<b>Are you in a feud</b>
<b>with the crazy Homicides?</b>

10:34.209 --> 10:35.501
<b>They stole your pop rocks?</b>

10:35.584 --> 10:37.834
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>They're coming right at us.</b>

10:37.918 --> 10:40.667
<b>George: What happened?</b>
<b>- Just then, right behind us,</b>

10:40.751 --> 10:44.417
<b>but in the same direction, four or five</b>
<b>members of the Jolly Stompers.</b>

10:44.501 --> 10:46.042
<b>- Oh, thatâs the guys who's</b>
<b>in the satin jackets.</b>

10:46.125 --> 10:49.584
<b>- Jolly Stompers, I mean, terrifying when</b>
<b>you see them on the train,</b>

10:49.667 --> 10:52.626
<b>but when there's 80 Homicides</b>
<b>chasing them, fairly docile.</b>

10:52.709 --> 10:55.042
<b>One of them had a little ball of shit rolling</b>
<b>down his pant leg as he ran.</b>

10:55.125 --> 10:56.375
<b>They were scared.</b>

10:56.459 --> 10:57.709
<b>And then--</b>
<b>- So wait a minute, wait.</b>

10:57.792 --> 11:00.292
<b>The Homicide gang were chasing them.</b>

11:00.375 --> 11:02.542
<b>- Thank Christ, at least</b>
<b>from our point of view.</b>

11:02.626 --> 11:04.918
<b>So these ill-fated Jolly Stompers</b>
<b>run past us</b>

11:05.000 --> 11:08.751
<b>and we're standing there frozen,</b>
<b>can't move, and this</b>

11:08.834 --> 11:12.209
<b>running mob runs around us</b>
<b>like a herd of buffalo</b>

11:12.292 --> 11:13.792
<b>and we're just standing there and then</b>

11:13.876 --> 11:16.125
<b>ten seconds, just standing</b>
<b>around us yelling.</b>

11:16.209 --> 11:17.876
<b>Homicides, Homicides,</b>

11:17.959 --> 11:21.501
<b>and running after these poor souls, who</b>
<b>are probably dead by now, by the way.</b>

11:21.584 --> 11:23.083
<b>And--</b>

11:23.167 --> 11:24.459
<b>And ten seconds later, they're gone.</b>

11:24.542 --> 11:25.584
<b>Just me and my daughter,</b>

11:25.667 --> 11:28.292
<b>standing there,</b>
<b>my 13-year-old daughter and me,</b>

11:28.375 --> 11:30.792
<b>and we still have nothing to talk about.</b>

11:30.876 --> 11:35.709
<b>(women laughing)</b>

11:35.792 --> 11:37.918
<b>- Hey, Pete.</b>
<b>Give me another one?</b>

11:41.000 --> 11:42.459
<b>- Cash first.</b>

11:42.542 --> 11:44.250
<b>- What?</b>

11:44.334 --> 11:46.167
<b>- Horace, come on.</b>
<b>What is this shit?</b>

11:46.250 --> 11:47.792
<b>- Hey.</b>

11:47.876 --> 11:50.125
<b>You ain't paid for the last three</b>
<b>I poured you.</b>

11:50.209 --> 11:51.584
<b>- Okay, okay, okay.</b>
<b>- Cash first.</b>

11:51.667 --> 11:53.167
<b>- So Iâm broke.</b>

11:53.250 --> 11:56.375
<b>I've got...</b>

11:56.459 --> 11:58.542
<b>I've got a quarter.</b>

12:02.459 --> 12:03.667
<b>You know what?</b>

12:03.751 --> 12:05.626
<b>What if I could make</b>

12:05.709 --> 12:09.125
<b>a one dollar bill that you gave me</b>
<b>change into a twenty.</b>

12:09.209 --> 12:11.334
<b>- Ooh, I wanna see it.</b>
<b>- I wanna go dancing.</b>

12:11.417 --> 12:13.959
<b>- Then you'll give me a free drink?</b>

12:14.042 --> 12:17.292
<b>- What are you talking about?</b>
<b>- If I can make your one into a twenty.</b>

12:17.375 --> 12:19.083
<b>Can I-- Can I borrow this?</b>
<b>Swear you'll get it right back.</b>

12:19.167 --> 12:20.501
<b>I won't do--</b>
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

12:20.584 --> 12:22.000
<b>- Do you have a--</b>
<b>Could I--</b>

12:22.083 --> 12:24.834
<b>Yeah?</b>

12:24.918 --> 12:27.167
<b>Here, you take the twenty,</b>
<b>I don't want to touch his money.</b>

12:27.250 --> 12:28.417
<b>His money.</b>

12:28.501 --> 12:30.501
<b>Your money, I don't do anything.</b>

12:30.584 --> 12:32.792
<b>Just-- Just fold it.</b>

12:32.876 --> 12:35.417
<b>No, no, no.</b>
<b>Fold it, fold it, fold it.</b>

12:35.501 --> 12:37.542
<b>And then again, this way.</b>

12:37.626 --> 12:38.709
<b>Crease it.</b>
<b>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</b>

12:38.792 --> 12:41.250
<b>Like this.</b>
<b>Yeah, yeah, good, good, good.</b>

12:41.334 --> 12:44.375
<b>Here, so if I rub the twenty,</b>
<b>just like this, here.</b>

12:44.459 --> 12:45.834
<b>Can you see, your twenty?</b>

12:45.918 --> 12:47.501
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Look.</b>

12:47.584 --> 12:52.542
<b>If I rub the twenty against the one, see,</b>
<b>the ink'll start to change.</b>

12:52.626 --> 12:53.709
<b>See? Here, you see your twenty?</b>

12:53.792 --> 12:54.834
<b>I'm going to give you</b>
<b>my one, but look.</b>

12:54.918 --> 12:57.709
<b>If I just place the little piece on top</b>

12:57.792 --> 13:00.542
<b>like this and I do that.</b>

13:00.626 --> 13:02.834
<b>See, now, actually--</b>

13:02.918 --> 13:04.751
<b>No...</b>

13:04.834 --> 13:06.292
<b>I kinda messed up.</b>
<b>George: Oh! That's a--</b>

13:06.375 --> 13:07.417
<b>(laughter)</b>

13:07.501 --> 13:08.584
<b>- Fuck?</b>

13:08.667 --> 13:10.459
<b>What the fuck?</b>
<b>How did you do that?</b>

13:10.542 --> 13:11.667
<b>- I didn't do that.</b>

13:11.751 --> 13:13.250
<b>It just happened.</b>

13:13.334 --> 13:14.501
<b>- Come on, what do you think--</b>

13:14.584 --> 13:16.083
<b>- Don't fucking touch me.</b>

13:16.167 --> 13:17.709
<b>Now, just tell me how you did it.</b>

13:17.792 --> 13:19.042
<b>How the fuck did you do that?</b>

13:19.125 --> 13:20.459
<b>Horace: Hey, it's a trick.</b>
<b>Horace Sr: Tell him it's a trick, please.</b>

13:20.542 --> 13:21.584
<b>Horace: It's a trick.</b>

13:21.667 --> 13:22.918
<b>- I don't know any tricks.</b>

13:23.000 --> 13:25.667
<b>I just watch nature happen.</b>

13:25.751 --> 13:26.792
<b>- Nature?</b>

13:26.876 --> 13:28.250
<b>You fucking freak!</b>

13:28.334 --> 13:29.542
<b>What?</b>
<b>My eyes didn't see that, all right?</b>

13:29.626 --> 13:31.000
<b>What did you do?</b>
<b>What happened?</b>

13:31.083 --> 13:32.250
<b>- It's all right, Pete, it's a trick.</b>

13:32.334 --> 13:33.375
<b>He's doing--</b>
<b>Show him the trick.</b>

13:33.459 --> 13:34.501
<b>- I don't know.</b>

13:34.584 --> 13:35.959
<b>Horace: Show him the trick</b>
<b>or we need you to go.</b>

13:36.042 --> 13:37.167
<b>- I don't know.</b>
<b>Here.</b>

13:37.250 --> 13:38.751
<b>(glass breaking)</b>
<b>- Oh!</b>

13:38.834 --> 13:40.876
<b>- Okay, all right.</b>
<b>Time to go, time to go.</b>

13:40.959 --> 13:42.000
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>Horace: Let's go.</b>

13:42.083 --> 13:43.626
<b>- Okay, I'm going.</b>
<b>- Let's go.</b>

13:43.709 --> 13:46.417
<b>- Hey, wait, wait, wait.</b>
<b>Where's my twenty?</b>

13:46.501 --> 13:48.584
<b>- Look under Pete's watch.</b>

13:49.667 --> 13:51.834
<b>- Holy shit.</b>

13:51.918 --> 13:53.000
<b>- All right.</b>

13:53.083 --> 13:55.459
<b>That's enough.</b>
<b>- Fucking scumbag!</b>

13:55.542 --> 13:58.000
<b>What the--</b>
<b>Horace: That's enough of your shit.</b>

13:58.083 --> 14:00.417
<b>Let's go, goodbye.</b>

14:00.501 --> 14:02.000
<b>- What the fuck was that, huh?</b>

14:02.083 --> 14:03.792
<b>- Yeah.</b>

14:11.626 --> 14:13.542
<b>Mary Ann: (quietly)</b>
<b>Iâm just gonna go.</b>

14:17.542 --> 14:18.584
<b>- Why are you going there?</b>

14:18.667 --> 14:20.083
<b>- Iâm just gonna go to my sister's house.</b>

14:20.167 --> 14:21.209
<b>I can go where I want.</b>
<b>- No, you're not.</b>

14:21.292 --> 14:23.083
<b>- I don't need your permission, Horace.</b>
<b>- No, you're not.</b>

14:23.167 --> 14:25.501
<b>- You have no right to keep me here</b>
<b>like a fucking prisoner.</b>

14:25.584 --> 14:26.626
<b>Just let me go, please.</b>

14:26.709 --> 14:28.083
<b>- All right, go ahead.</b>

14:31.042 --> 14:32.375
<b>(Mary Ann gasps)</b>

14:38.584 --> 14:40.792
<b>- I told you to cut your hair.</b>

14:44.334 --> 14:48.292
<b>- So, anyone have an opinion on this</b>
<b>peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter?</b>

14:48.375 --> 14:52.125
<b>Looks like he's floating</b>
<b>to the top of the sewer.</b>

14:52.209 --> 14:54.584
<b>Could be our next president.</b>

14:54.667 --> 14:59.334
<b>- Well, anything to throw that fuckin'</b>
<b>bum Ford out of there.</b>

14:59.417 --> 15:01.792
<b>- Okay, now, what's your</b>
<b>problem with Ford?</b>

15:01.876 --> 15:03.584
<b>- Are you fucking kidding me?</b>

15:03.667 --> 15:04.918
<b>You know what he said, he--</b>

15:05.000 --> 15:06.125
<b>Here.</b>

15:06.209 --> 15:07.542
<b>I saved it, all right?</b>

<b>"Ford to City: Drop Dead."</b>

<b>Horace: He's been saving that headline</b>

<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>Fuck this guy!</b>

15:12.918 --> 15:14.834
<b>He can go fuck himself forever.</b>

15:14.918 --> 15:18.792
<b>You know what?</b>
<b>I wish I had Squeaky Fromme right here</b>

15:18.876 --> 15:21.042
<b>and I could fucking teach her how to</b>
<b>shoot a gun.</b>

15:21.125 --> 15:22.167
<b>Jimmy: Oh.</b>

15:22.250 --> 15:24.792
<b>- Fucking hippies, they send</b>
<b>in a girl, you know?</b>

15:24.876 --> 15:26.167
<b>I mean, she had a clear shot at Ford</b>

15:26.250 --> 15:28.250
<b>and she throws the bullet like a girl.</b>

15:28.334 --> 15:29.375
<b>- Holy moly.</b>

15:29.459 --> 15:30.918
<b>Pete.</b>

15:31.000 --> 15:34.083
<b>I understand you have a hate for the</b>

15:34.167 --> 15:35.209
<b>Jeez.</b>
<b>- Oh, wait-- Wait a minute.</b>

15:35.292 --> 15:36.834
<b>Where does he get the balls, all right?</b>

15:36.918 --> 15:38.959
<b>To tell America's greatest city</b>
<b>to drop dead.</b>

15:39.042 --> 15:40.584
<b>- That's just it.</b>
<b>He never said that.</b>

15:40.667 --> 15:43.542
<b>The Daily News said he did,</b>
<b>but he didn't say it.</b>

15:43.626 --> 15:46.751
<b>- Oh, I don't care.</b>
<b>You don't, as leader of the free world,</b>

15:46.834 --> 15:50.501
<b>tell this city, I mean, this great city,</b>
<b>which by the way,</b>

15:50.584 --> 15:53.959
<b>gave more of its sons and brothers to</b>
<b>every war,</b>

15:54.042 --> 15:55.876
<b>you know, since we kept the British from</b>

15:55.959 --> 15:57.459
<b>crossing the Hudson River.</b>

15:57.542 --> 15:59.334
<b>- Not accurate, but I get your point.</b>

15:59.417 --> 16:01.626
<b>- How-- How do you</b>
<b>tell a whole city</b>

16:01.709 --> 16:03.626
<b>of New Yorkers to drop dead, all right?</b>

16:03.709 --> 16:07.125
<b>New York is the greatest</b>
<b>city in the world.</b>

16:07.209 --> 16:09.959
<b>- Paris is a better city.</b>

16:10.042 --> 16:12.042
<b>- He's right.</b>
<b>We got nothing on Paris.</b>

16:12.125 --> 16:13.834
<b>- I wish I was in Paris right now.</b>

16:13.918 --> 16:15.834
<b>- What's so fucking great about Paris?</b>

16:15.918 --> 16:17.209
<b>- Shut up.</b>

<b>Cancan.</b>

<b>You heard me.</b>
<b>Close it up now, and get out.</b>

16:33.501 --> 16:34.542
<b>Horace: Get outta here.</b>
<b>- Get out.</b>

16:34.626 --> 16:36.292
<b>Horace: Get outta here.</b>

<b>And he's a clumsy motherfucker.</b>

<b>- Pete, I understand you don't like the</b>
<b>president, but the fact is,</b>

17:11.876 --> 17:13.959
<b>he never said</b>
<b>"Drop dead, New York."</b>

17:14.041 --> 17:15.125
<b>He probably said--</b>

17:15.209 --> 17:16.834
<b>he said something</b>
<b>a lot more boring, like,</b>

17:16.917 --> 17:20.791
<b>I'll veto any bill that includes the bailout</b>
<b>of the municipal government</b>

<b>- All right, all right, Jimmy, why don't you</b>
<b>change the subject, huh?</b>

17:26.416 --> 17:27.666
<b>What else is in the news?</b>

17:27.751 --> 17:31.751
<b>- Well, Namath going to the Rams.</b>

17:31.834 --> 17:33.542
<b>I mean...</b>
<b>- Who cares?</b>

17:33.626 --> 17:34.834
<b>- Well, I for one, don't like it.</b>

17:34.918 --> 17:36.209
<b>Anyone care to weigh in?</b>

<b>- Oh, yeah?</b>
<b>Prove it.</b>

17:56.626 --> 17:57.751
<b>- All right, all right, all right.</b>
<b>All right, he said it 'cause--</b>

17:57.834 --> 17:59.167
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- He said it 'cause you said it.</b>

17:59.250 --> 18:00.834
<b>He said it 'cause you said it.</b>
<b>- But I'm not a fag.</b>

18:00.918 --> 18:02.083
<b>- Yeah, no, we know you're not a fag.</b>

18:02.167 --> 18:04.459
<b>Right, you said it, 'cause you retaliated.</b>
<b>- Yeah, I said it 'cause you said I was--</b>

<b>- Right?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

<b>Mike, let me get--</b>
<b>Let me buy you a beer.</b>

18:16.292 --> 18:17.918
<b>It's okay, Pete.</b>

<b>- I can't come, Abb.</b>

<b>He won't--</b>
<b>He won't let me leave here.</b>

18:24.000 --> 18:26.042
<b>I can't just leave.</b>

<b>And we'll talk about it, okay?</b>

18:37.834 --> 18:40.209
<b>Wha-- Why? Becau--</b>
<b>Yeah, because he's my husband.</b>

18:40.292 --> 18:44.375
<b>That is my fault and I can't do anything</b>
<b>about that.</b>

18:44.459 --> 18:47.334
<b>No, do not come here, I'm telling you,</b>
<b>that's gonna make things worse.</b>

18:50.417 --> 18:52.375
<b>Yeah, I know, I know.</b>
<b>I know, I know.</b>

18:52.459 --> 18:54.375
<b>I-- I don't know what to do.</b>

18:54.459 --> 18:55.751
<b>I don't know--</b>

18:55.834 --> 18:58.876
<b>I don't know what to do,</b>
<b>can't do this anymore.</b>

18:58.959 --> 19:01.834
<b>I just want to die every day.</b>

<b>I can't.</b>

19:03.542 --> 19:05.667
<b>No, do not--</b>
<b>I can't, I can't, Abby.</b>

19:05.751 --> 19:07.709
<b>Don't do that.</b>
<b>I'm telling you, don't come here.</b>

19:10.959 --> 19:12.292
<b>Just tell me that--</b>

19:12.375 --> 19:16.250
<b>That you love me</b>
<b>and that it's gonna be okay.</b>

19:16.334 --> 19:18.250
<b>I know, but just say it anyway,</b>
<b>will you, honey, please?</b>

19:18.334 --> 19:21.292
<b>Iâm dying over here, I need you.</b>

19:21.375 --> 19:24.125
<b>I don't need you like that.</b>

19:24.209 --> 19:26.292
<b>Why can't I?</b>
<b>Why can't I?</b>

19:26.375 --> 19:30.209
<b>Iâm the one getting my ass kicked</b>
<b>over here, itâs not you.</b>

19:30.292 --> 19:32.167
<b>Horace.</b>

19:32.250 --> 19:34.459
<b>Yeah, I have children here, you don't</b>
<b>know what that's like.</b>

19:34.542 --> 19:35.584
<b>(change jingling)</b>

19:35.667 --> 19:36.751
<b>Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that.</b>

19:36.834 --> 19:38.334
<b>What are you, crazy?</b>

19:38.417 --> 19:39.584
<b>Yeah.</b>

19:39.667 --> 19:41.000
<b>No, I can't do that.</b>

19:41.083 --> 19:42.125
<b>Come here.</b>

19:42.209 --> 19:45.959
<b>Go downstairs, get mama</b>
<b>a pack of cigarettes.</b>

19:46.042 --> 19:47.918
<b>Yeah, I know, I know, I know.</b>

19:48.000 --> 19:50.167
<b>I know, Abby.</b>

19:50.250 --> 19:53.918
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

19:54.000 --> 19:56.083
<b>- Well, Little Horace,</b>
<b>when he was about six,</b>

19:56.167 --> 19:59.209
<b>he was in the little league</b>
<b>and I coached his team, right?</b>

19:59.292 --> 20:03.083
<b>And so he played right field, so right</b>
<b>away, you know how good he is, right?</b>

20:03.167 --> 20:05.334
<b>I mean, how many kids that age</b>
<b>could hit it out to right field?</b>

20:05.417 --> 20:09.042
<b>So he'd be out there, you know,</b>
<b>picking his nose and staring off,</b>

20:09.125 --> 20:13.000
<b>and then one day, he comes running up</b>
<b>to me in the middle of the game,</b>

20:13.083 --> 20:14.334
<b>up to the bench,</b>
<b>he says,</b>

20:14.417 --> 20:17.000
<b>(high pitched) Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete,</b>

20:17.083 --> 20:20.083
<b>I gotta make a pee pee!</b>

20:20.167 --> 20:22.167
<b>I said, get the fuck</b>
<b>back out on the field!</b>

20:22.250 --> 20:23.834
<b>What's the matter with you?</b>
<b>(laughter)</b>

20:23.918 --> 20:27.667
<b>He said, (high pitched) time out,</b>
<b>Uncle Pete, I gotta make a pee pee!</b>

20:27.751 --> 20:29.876
<b>I said, I don't care if you</b>
<b>gotta make a doo-doo.</b>

20:29.959 --> 20:32.250
<b>You don't stop in the middle of the game.</b>

20:32.334 --> 20:33.959
<b>What are you doing?</b>

20:34.042 --> 20:35.501
<b>What is this, girls' softball?</b>

20:35.584 --> 20:37.959
<b>And then he's crying like, wahh...</b>

20:38.042 --> 20:39.709
<b>All right, all right,</b>
<b>I had to call a time-out.</b>

20:39.792 --> 20:41.292
<b>So I say to the ump, time out.</b>

20:41.375 --> 20:45.959
<b>And then I go over to Horace, I said,</b>
<b>okay, all right, come here.</b>

20:46.042 --> 20:47.167
<b>Here, come here.</b>

20:47.250 --> 20:48.501
<b>I said, all right, Horace.</b>

20:48.584 --> 20:51.209
<b>I called a time out so you</b>
<b>can go take a leak, all right?</b>

20:51.292 --> 20:54.000
<b>I mean, what am I gonna do?</b>
<b>He's my nephew and he's crying, right?</b>

20:54.083 --> 20:58.792
<b>So I said, okay, honey, go to the toilet,</b>
<b>I'll put Ralphie in right field, all right?</b>

20:58.876 --> 21:01.125
<b>So you can go take a pee pee.</b>

21:01.209 --> 21:03.334
<b>And he's crying, just standing there.</b>

21:03.417 --> 21:05.626
<b>I said, what's the matter with you?</b>

21:05.709 --> 21:07.125
<b>I thought you had to go</b>
<b>make a pee pee?</b>

21:07.209 --> 21:09.375
<b>Now go make a pee pee!</b>

21:09.459 --> 21:11.417
<b>And he says...</b>

21:11.501 --> 21:16.250
<b>(high pitched) Uncle Pete,</b>
<b>Uncle Pete, it's too late!</b>

21:16.334 --> 21:19.584
<b>I look and he's got piss</b>
<b>all over his pants!</b>

21:19.667 --> 21:21.209
<b>His pants are covered in piss!</b>

21:21.292 --> 21:23.459
<b>Remember that, Horace?</b>

21:23.542 --> 21:25.375
<b>Remember when you peed</b>
<b>your pants in little league?</b>

21:25.459 --> 21:26.834
<b>Where you going?</b>

21:26.918 --> 21:29.375
<b>Oh, come on, you little crybaby!</b>

21:29.459 --> 21:31.709
<b>- Don't cry, little Horace.</b>

21:31.792 --> 21:35.918
<b>Horace: He's all right.</b>
<b>He's all right, Pa.</b>

21:36.000 --> 21:37.042
<b>man: Oh, Jesus.</b>

21:37.125 --> 21:42.125
<b>- Hey, Horace, didn't your other</b>
<b>boy play baseball, too?</b>

21:42.209 --> 21:44.792
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>Yeah, Little Pete's good.</b>

21:44.876 --> 21:46.709
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- He's on a team, he's great.</b>

21:46.792 --> 21:50.292
<b>Shortstop, and he can hit it.</b>

21:50.375 --> 21:51.834
<b>Fantastic.</b>

21:57.667 --> 21:59.375
<b>- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.</b>

<b>Where you been?</b>

22:01.292 --> 22:03.000
<b>Where you been?</b>

22:03.083 --> 22:04.834
<b>- Heaven.</b>

22:04.918 --> 22:06.792
<b>- Tell me where you been.</b>
<b>What, are you fucking wearing lipstick?</b>

22:06.876 --> 22:08.000
<b>When'd you start wearing lipstick?</b>

<b>Where you been?</b>

22:09.209 --> 22:10.876
<b>Tell me where you been and don't lie.</b>

22:10.959 --> 22:12.083
<b>Don't tell me you been at Tina's,</b>
<b>'cause your mother</b>

22:12.167 --> 22:14.167
<b>already colluded on that lie</b>
<b>and I'm not buying it.</b>

22:14.250 --> 22:17.918
<b>- I don't have to lie to you, I don't have to</b>
<b>tell you anything.</b>

22:18.000 --> 22:19.334
<b>- You're dating that nigger again.</b>

22:19.417 --> 22:23.959
<b>- Yeah, I don't date niggers,</b>
<b>Dad, I just fuck 'em.</b>

22:24.042 --> 22:25.334
<b>- There's something wrong with you.</b>

22:25.417 --> 22:26.667
<b>- Oh, yeah?</b>
<b>- There's something wrong with you.</b>

22:26.751 --> 22:27.792
<b>- Yeah, what's wrong with me?</b>

22:27.876 --> 22:30.542
<b>- Somebody should put you away.</b>
<b>- Oh, yeah?</b>

22:35.918 --> 22:38.626
<b>- She's got a mouth on her.</b>

22:38.709 --> 22:40.501
<b>I mean, the way she talks.</b>

22:43.375 --> 22:45.292
<b>You know what I heard?</b>

22:45.375 --> 22:47.542
<b>That all teenage girls,</b>

<b>they got, like,</b>
<b>a hormonal imbalance,</b>

22:54.042 --> 22:58.501
<b>beat the shit out of them, tell them right</b>

<b>- That's true.</b>

22:59.792 --> 23:01.959
<b>She gonna be married in another</b>
<b>year anyway, Horace.</b>

23:02.042 --> 23:04.250
<b>Let some other guy smack her out.</b>

23:04.334 --> 23:07.417
<b>- Your people do that a lot,</b>

<b>- Well, I just do what my daddy did, man.</b>

23:14.209 --> 23:16.709
<b>- A teenage girl hates her father.</b>

23:16.792 --> 23:18.792
<b>She's supposed to.</b>

23:18.876 --> 23:22.918
<b>It's a biological imperative so she doesn't</b>

23:23.000 --> 23:25.542

<b>What did you do to my stuff?</b>
<b>Little Pete: What?</b>

24:25.459 --> 24:26.959
<b>- What did you do to my pictures?</b>

24:27.042 --> 24:28.626
<b>- I didn't do anything.</b>

24:28.709 --> 24:31.417
<b>- I found all these fucking</b>
<b>pictures in the trash.</b>

24:31.501 --> 24:35.042
<b>Those are mine and you</b>
<b>scratched out the faces!</b>

24:35.125 --> 24:36.375
<b>- Why do you think I did it!</b>

24:36.459 --> 24:38.250
<b>- Because you're a fucking retard!</b>

24:38.334 --> 24:40.959
<b>You have mental problems, or you're</b>

<b>Shut up!</b>

24:43.042 --> 24:44.792
<b>- What is wrong with you, Pete?</b>

24:44.876 --> 24:47.250
<b>Why can't any of us be normal?</b>
<b>- Shut up!</b>

24:47.334 --> 24:48.876

24:58.375 --> 25:00.042
<b>Mary Ann: How dare you?</b>
<b>Sylvia: I didn't do anything!</b>

25:00.125 --> 25:02.042
<b>(shouting continues)</b>

25:02.125 --> 25:03.459
<b>I didn't do anything!</b>

25:11.375 --> 25:12.459
<b>Little Horace: Why are we</b>

<b>This is a fucking waste of time.</b>
<b>Mary Ann: Yeah, you shut your mouth.</b>

25:19.792 --> 25:21.292
<b>This is all because of you.</b>

25:21.375 --> 25:23.083
<b>Because you had to stay out late.</b>
<b>- It's not my fault.</b>

25:23.167 --> 25:25.042
<b>- If I don't get us out of here, you have no</b>
<b>idea what's going on--</b>

25:25.125 --> 25:26.667
<b>- It's not my fault you don't</b>
<b>know how to fight back.</b>

25:26.751 --> 25:28.667
<b>- Horace, go, go, go.</b>

25:28.751 --> 25:30.918
<b>Okay.</b>

26:19.167 --> 26:20.584
<b>It's important.</b>

26:20.667 --> 26:22.250
<b>- You're gonna wake up your father.</b>

30:52.876 --> 30:54.918

<b>If your stomach hurts and you hurt it</b>

31:16.542 --> 31:18.292

31:18.375 --> 31:19.751

31:19.834 --> 31:22.292
<b>give it milk and honey and medicine</b>

<b>and it will be okay and...</b>

31:27.918 --> 31:32.834
<b>Then I thought, if someone's part of you,</b>
<b>how do you stop them from hurting you?</b>

31:32.918 --> 31:34.667
<b>And it's...</b>

31:34.751 --> 31:38.626
<b>It's by being good to them</b>

31:38.709 --> 31:43.501
<b>and being caring to them and giving</b>
<b>them milk and honey,</b>

31:43.584 --> 31:47.125

<b>of people to hurt you.</b>

31:49.209 --> 31:50.250

<b>That's not just Trump, that's our Trump,</b>
<b>do you understand?</b>

31:54.083 --> 31:57.792
<b>And he's in pain, and he's swollen,</b>

31:57.876 --> 31:59.250
<b>and get him in the White House.</b>

31:59.334 --> 32:01.709
<b>- Can't we just tell him</b>
<b>he's the president?</b>

32:01.792 --> 32:04.083
<b>You know, can't we just pretend,</b>
<b>so he'll be okay?</b>

32:04.167 --> 32:05.709
<b>- Like Batboy.</b>
<b>Leon: Yeah, like Batboy.</b>

32:05.792 --> 32:07.459

32:07.542 --> 32:08.834
<b>- Ugh.</b>

<b>Who cares?</b>

32:11.000 --> 32:13.334
<b>Whatever.</b>
<b>I don't vote, I think it's annoying.</b>

33:47.292 --> 33:48.459

33:48.542 --> 33:52.542
<b>What Iâm trying to say is...</b>

33:52.626 --> 33:56.000
<b>You know, someone in Pete's condition?</b>

33:56.083 --> 33:58.792
<b>He didn't go anywhere.</b>

33:58.876 --> 34:02.709
<b>He couldn't have gone anywhere.</b>

34:02.792 --> 34:05.918
<b>He's gone.</b>

34:06.000 --> 34:09.792

<b>Horace & Pete's ham recipe,</b>

<b>We're not doing Easter.</b>

35:56.250 --> 35:57.459
<b>- We're not?</b>

<b>He's gone.</b>
<b>So-- So what are you gonna do?</b>

36:22.000 --> 36:23.751
<b>- What are you talking about?</b>
<b>What the fuck-- What are you--</b>

36:23.834 --> 36:26.083
<b>Why are you saying this to--</b>
<b>What are you saying to me right now?</b>

36:26.167 --> 36:27.751
<b>Why are you saying this?</b>
<b>- Horace, because,</b>

36:27.834 --> 36:29.626
<b>right now is right now.</b>

36:29.709 --> 36:31.209
<b>Pete is gone.</b>

36:34.375 --> 36:35.584
<b>What are you gonna do?</b>

36:35.667 --> 36:37.876
<b>- Iâm not doing Easter.</b>
<b>Iâm not doing any of that.</b>

36:37.959 --> 36:39.083
<b>None of that makes sense</b>
<b>without Pete here.</b>

36:39.167 --> 36:40.918
<b>- Okay, so, then close this place down.</b>

36:41.000 --> 36:42.250
<b>Go do something else.</b>

36:42.334 --> 36:43.459
<b>- I can' t do that.</b>

36:43.542 --> 36:44.584
<b>- Why not?</b>

36:44.667 --> 36:45.959
<b>- Because he's gonna come back,</b>
<b>'cause he might come back.</b>

36:46.042 --> 36:49.125
<b>- He's-- Horace, he is not coming back.</b>
<b>Horace.</b>

36:49.209 --> 36:52.000
<b>Pete is dead, Horace.</b>

36:53.459 --> 36:56.375

37:02.083 --> 37:03.209
<b>of whatever time you fucking</b>
<b>have left.</b>

37:03.292 --> 37:04.459

<b>Iâm getting the fuck out of here.</b>

37:45.918 --> 37:47.000
<b>You can do what you want,</b>

37:47.083 --> 37:49.501
<b>but Harold and I are leaving town</b>
<b>on Monday and that's it.</b>

37:49.584 --> 37:51.209
<b>I'm getting the fuck out of here.</b>
<b>- Where?</b>

37:51.292 --> 37:52.584
<b>- Where--</b>
<b>I don't know where.</b>

37:52.667 --> 37:56.417
<b>See the country or whatever, just--</b>
<b>Just not here, though.</b>

37:56.501 --> 37:58.459
<b>- You're telling me that now?</b>
<b>- Yes, now.</b>

37:58.542 --> 38:00.459
<b>Yes, now, Horace.</b>

38:00.542 --> 38:02.542
<b>This is all you fucking have is right now.</b>
<b>Do you understand?</b>

38:02.626 --> 38:05.667
<b>I almost died and I got</b>
<b>my fucking life back,</b>

38:05.751 --> 38:08.667
<b>and Iâm not spending it here,</b>
<b>there's no fucking way.</b>

38:11.375 --> 38:15.292
<b>I hope you don't either, Horace.</b>

38:15.375 --> 38:18.584
<b>And I will miss you, but I'm not gonna sit</b>
<b>here and watch you rot.</b>

38:25.250 --> 38:28.584
<b>- Oh, Pete...</b>

38:28.667 --> 38:30.542
<b>Pete.</b>
<b>- Horace?</b>

38:30.626 --> 38:32.459
<b>You can call him all you want.</b>

38:32.542 --> 38:34.334
<b>He doesn't hear you, Horace.</b>

38:39.000 --> 38:40.626
<b>Horace.</b>

38:43.876 --> 38:48.792
<b>You know, fuck Easter, then, I mean,</b>
<b>like, you know, fuck that anyway.</b>

38:48.876 --> 38:51.501
<b>I am leaving on Monday.</b>

38:51.584 --> 38:53.083
<b>Do something.</b>

38:53.167 --> 38:56.209
<b>Please.</b>

38:56.292 --> 38:58.083
<b>Don't make me think about you sitting</b>
<b>there like...</b>

38:58.167 --> 39:00.083
<b>Like that.</b>

39:08.918 --> 39:12.167
<b>(door opens, footsteps approaching)</b>

39:15.209 --> 39:16.375
<b>- Hey.</b>

39:16.459 --> 39:18.292
<b>Hi. Iâm Mara.</b>

39:18.375 --> 39:20.417
<b>Iâm here for the interview.</b>
<b>- Sorry?</b>

39:20.501 --> 39:21.834
<b>- Oh, you sound like the guy</b>
<b>I talked to on the phone.</b>

39:21.918 --> 39:22.959
<b>Are you Horace?</b>

39:23.042 --> 39:24.501
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Oh, hey.</b>

39:24.584 --> 39:26.417
<b>How you doing?</b>

39:26.501 --> 39:27.918
<b>Gosh, it's so dark in here.</b>

39:28.000 --> 39:30.792
<b>So, Iâm here for the job interview.</b>
<b>- Oh.</b>

39:30.876 --> 39:32.250
<b>- Today.</b>

39:32.334 --> 39:33.375
<b>- We're looking for a bartender.</b>

39:33.459 --> 39:35.250
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>I'm the person, right here.</b>

39:35.334 --> 39:37.334
<b>Look.</b>
<b>Goodbye, gone.</b>

39:37.417 --> 39:38.792
<b>When do I start?</b>

39:38.876 --> 39:40.542
<b>Let's go.</b>

39:40.626 --> 39:42.751
<b>- Listen, this isn't a great time</b>
<b>for me right now.</b>

39:42.834 --> 39:44.167
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>- I'm sorry, I apologize.</b>

39:44.250 --> 39:45.709
<b>- Oh, Iâm sorry, just give me</b>
<b>ten minutes, though.</b>

39:45.792 --> 39:48.042
<b>Just give me ten minutes and then you</b>
<b>won't have to see me again</b>

39:48.125 --> 39:50.042
<b>'til tomorrow, at work.</b>

39:50.125 --> 39:51.792
<b>Horace.</b>
<b>- You want an interview now?</b>

39:51.876 --> 39:52.918
<b>- Yes, please.</b>

39:53.000 --> 39:54.459
<b>I mean, that's what you said</b>
<b>and I'm in a hurry.</b>

39:54.542 --> 39:55.876
<b>I have popsicles in the car.</b>

39:55.959 --> 39:57.417
<b>Popsicles melt.</b>

39:57.501 --> 39:59.083
<b>And then it's juice.</b>

39:59.167 --> 40:01.834
<b>Who likes juice, Horace?</b>

40:01.918 --> 40:03.083
<b>Please?</b>

40:03.167 --> 40:05.959
<b>- Sure, have a seat, would you?</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

40:06.042 --> 40:08.125
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>Now, I know this job starts tomorrow,</b>

40:08.209 --> 40:09.334
<b>but Iâm gonna need</b>
<b>next weekend off</b>

40:09.417 --> 40:11.000
<b>because Iâm gonna go to Chicago.</b>

40:11.083 --> 40:13.250
<b>They're having a bit of a--</b>

40:13.334 --> 40:16.125
<b>Like, a little party thing</b>
<b>that I want to go to.</b>

40:16.209 --> 40:17.250
<b>And I like going to parties.</b>
<b>- In Chicago?</b>

40:17.334 --> 40:18.375
<b>- Yeah, in Chicago.</b>

40:18.459 --> 40:20.292
<b>The land of pizza, yes.</b>

40:20.375 --> 40:21.792
<b>This is a nice place.</b>

40:21.876 --> 40:24.417
<b>Do you have any termites?</b>
<b>Everything's wood.</b>

40:24.501 --> 40:25.542
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

40:25.626 --> 40:27.542
<b>Are you okay?</b>
<b>I mean...</b>

40:27.626 --> 40:29.083
<b>- Yeah, no, yeah.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

40:29.167 --> 40:30.417
<b>All right.</b>
<b>- So, have you...</b>

40:30.501 --> 40:32.876
<b>- Um, yes?</b>
<b>- ... bartended before?</b>

40:32.959 --> 40:34.918
<b>- I have, I've bartended a lot, actually.</b>

40:35.000 --> 40:39.125
<b>The last, I was in Greece, I worked at</b>
<b>a taverna for a while in Athens, Greece.</b>

40:39.209 --> 40:42.292
<b>And then I did a little bit</b>
<b>of bartending in Mykonos,</b>

40:42.375 --> 40:45.083
<b>'cause I was there, and I bartended in</b>

40:45.167 --> 40:47.292
<b>Chicago at a little club,</b>
<b>but I hated the manager.</b>

40:47.375 --> 40:49.292
<b>I'm not gonna give you his reference.</b>
<b>I hated his guts.</b>

40:49.375 --> 40:51.000
<b>I actually took his keys</b>
<b>and I threw them in the snow</b>

40:51.083 --> 40:53.250
<b>'cause I knew he wouldn't</b>
<b>find them 'til the springtime.</b>

40:53.334 --> 40:54.501
<b>I just couldn't stand that guy.</b>

40:54.584 --> 40:55.626
<b>I mean, I know I shouldn't</b>
<b>be telling you that,</b>

40:55.709 --> 40:57.667
<b>'cause here I am trying to get a job, but...</b>

40:57.751 --> 41:01.375
<b>And then I've been everywhere but pretty</b>
<b>much, like, North and South Dakota,</b>

41:01.459 --> 41:03.334
<b>I've never been.</b>
<b>But I love Black Hills Gold,</b>

41:03.417 --> 41:04.667
<b>so I should go there one day, right?</b>

41:04.751 --> 41:05.792
<b>Are you all right?</b>

41:05.876 --> 41:07.167
<b>You look--</b>
<b>- I've had a tough day.</b>

41:07.250 --> 41:09.167
<b>- Oh.</b>
<b>I'm sorry, let me just..</b>

41:09.250 --> 41:12.042
<b>God, it's driving me crazy, your eyes are,</b>
<b>like, soaking wet.</b>

41:12.125 --> 41:13.250
<b>They're, like, soaking wet.</b>

41:13.334 --> 41:14.459
<b>Do you have an allergy problem</b>

41:14.542 --> 41:15.584
<b>or something?</b>
<b>- Um.</b>

41:15.667 --> 41:17.000
<b>- Look, Iâm gonna just go like this.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

41:17.083 --> 41:18.292
<b>- And you're just gonna breathe.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

41:18.375 --> 41:19.417
<b>- Isn't that good?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

41:19.501 --> 41:20.626
<b>- You know, sometimes,</b>
<b>if you just press on the temple--</b>

41:20.709 --> 41:22.334
<b>You have a headache, don't you?</b>
<b>- A little bit, yeah.</b>

41:22.417 --> 41:24.292
<b>- Look, 'cause, like, your whole face is</b>
<b>full of strawberries.</b>

41:24.375 --> 41:25.709
<b>You're sensitive, aren't you?</b>

41:25.792 --> 41:27.751
<b>Redheads are sensitive.</b>
<b>- Yeah, I guess so.</b>

41:27.834 --> 41:28.876
<b>- When's your birthday?</b>

41:28.959 --> 41:30.542
<b>Are you a Virgo?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

41:30.626 --> 41:32.125
<b>- I knew it, I knew it, see.</b>

41:32.209 --> 41:35.542
<b>I do just a little bit of palm reading and</b>
<b>can do horoscopes, charts.</b>

41:35.626 --> 41:37.417
<b>This woman taught me.</b>

41:37.501 --> 41:38.667
<b>- Who taught you?</b>
<b>- Yeah, she was a pill-popping,</b>

41:38.751 --> 41:42.375
<b>you know, astrologer, but she taught me</b>
<b>how to read charts.</b>

41:42.459 --> 41:44.375
<b>It's fascinating, so I'm really good--</b>

41:44.459 --> 41:45.626
<b>Iâm really good with people.</b>

41:45.709 --> 41:47.876
<b>I'm really great with strangers.</b>

41:47.959 --> 41:50.459
<b>- So where did you work besides Chicago</b>
<b>and Greece?</b>

41:50.542 --> 41:53.918
<b>- Oh, gosh, I worked in Vancouver for a</b>
<b>while at this place called</b>

41:54.000 --> 41:55.667
<b>the Golfin' Dolphin, but they didn't</b>

41:55.751 --> 41:58.709
<b>have alcohol, but I served drinks, but it</b>
<b>was just, like, you know,</b>

41:58.792 --> 42:02.459
<b>water mixed with, like,</b>
<b>flavored juice.</b>

42:02.542 --> 42:05.959
<b>I didn't work there long, but that was in</b>
<b>Vancouver and that was a lot of fun.</b>

42:06.042 --> 42:09.250
<b>And then I worked in Iowa for a while</b>

42:09.334 --> 42:11.334
<b>and then Washington, D.C.</b>

42:11.417 --> 42:12.876
<b>and then I worked in</b>

42:12.959 --> 42:14.709
<b>South Carolina, Charleston.</b>
<b>- Where are you from?</b>

42:14.792 --> 42:16.375
<b>- Are you--</b>
<b>Originally, Iâm from North Carolina.</b>

42:16.459 --> 42:17.501
<b>Raleigh, the capital.</b>

42:17.584 --> 42:18.626
<b>You been there?</b>
<b>- No.</b>

42:18.709 --> 42:19.792
<b>- Near Cherry Point.</b>

42:19.876 --> 42:21.501
<b>It's like a military base.</b>

42:21.584 --> 42:24.083
<b>I went there 'cause I wanted to save</b>
<b>my money to get a Hobie Cat, a boat.</b>

42:24.167 --> 42:26.375
<b>Do you ever go sailing</b>
<b>or anything like that?</b>

42:26.459 --> 42:27.501
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- Do you know anything about--</b>

42:27.584 --> 42:28.626
<b>Well, you're sensitive.</b>

42:28.709 --> 42:30.292
<b>I bet you want to stay out</b>
<b>of the sun, right?</b>

42:30.375 --> 42:33.083
<b>You probably frizzle,</b>
<b>you burn, you know?</b>

42:33.167 --> 42:34.959
<b>Ha, look at that, you're smiling!</b>

42:35.042 --> 42:36.417
<b>Look at that smile.</b>

42:36.501 --> 42:39.334
<b>See, you use every muscle</b>
<b>in your face when you smile.</b>

42:39.417 --> 42:40.626
<b>You're all sad sack.</b>

42:40.709 --> 42:41.834
<b>You know?</b>

42:41.918 --> 42:43.042
<b>Can I get you a drink?</b>

42:43.125 --> 42:44.417
<b>Maybe that'll cheer you up.</b>

42:44.501 --> 42:46.959
<b>Then I can prove to you how good</b>
<b>Iâm gonna be at this job.</b>

42:47.042 --> 42:48.542
<b>- Listen, Mora, can I have</b>
<b>your phone number?</b>

42:48.626 --> 42:50.292
<b>Maybe I'll call you when--</b>
<b>- Oh! My phone number?</b>

42:50.375 --> 42:52.918
<b>- I mean, just so I can call you when we</b>
<b>figure out what we're doing,</b>

42:53.000 --> 42:54.417
<b>'cause Iâm not sure what</b>
<b>we're doing.</b>

42:54.501 --> 42:56.083
<b>- Okay, Iâm gonna give you</b>
<b>a phone number.</b>

42:56.167 --> 42:58.167
<b>I don't really have a phone,</b>
<b>but I know this guy--</b>

42:58.250 --> 42:59.417
<b>It's a long story.</b>

42:59.501 --> 43:00.918
<b>It's this guy I dated for a long time,</b>

43:01.000 --> 43:03.083
<b>he was actually an alcoholic</b>
<b>and gay and he came to my</b>

43:03.167 --> 43:04.792
<b>house and he drank all the sangria</b>

43:04.876 --> 43:07.667
<b>and then I had this watermelon and he</b>
<b>picked it up and he threw it on the floor</b>

43:07.751 --> 43:09.167
<b>and then he wet my bed.</b>

43:09.250 --> 43:11.083
<b>I dated him for two years, it took me five</b>
<b>to get over him,</b>

43:11.167 --> 43:14.083
<b>but I'm gonna give you his number.</b>
<b>He'll call you.</b>

43:14.167 --> 43:16.125
<b>Ugh, he was a Sagittarius.</b>

43:16.209 --> 43:18.959
<b>You know, they say if you look at</b>
<b>something green</b>

43:19.042 --> 43:21.626
<b>for ten minutes every day,</b>
<b>it's supposed to cheer you up.</b>

43:21.709 --> 43:23.083
<b>- I didn't know that.</b>

43:23.167 --> 43:24.709
<b>- Why don't you come</b>
<b>to Chicago with me?</b>

43:24.792 --> 43:27.709
<b>Iâm not gonna be there long.</b>

43:27.792 --> 43:29.292
<b>I don't even know you.</b>
<b>That's weird, isn't it?</b>

43:29.375 --> 43:30.542
<b>Right?</b>
<b>- Sure.</b>

43:30.626 --> 43:33.417
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>Oh! You have a jukebox.</b>

43:33.501 --> 43:35.125
<b>There's your fun over there.</b>

43:35.209 --> 43:36.417
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Do you have any money?</b>

43:36.501 --> 43:38.042
<b>- It's free, we just let you give--</b>

43:38.125 --> 43:40.709
<b>- Oh, free?</b>
<b>Finally, something free, okay.</b>

43:40.792 --> 43:42.626
<b>I'm gonna play a song and Iâm gonna get</b>
<b>out of your hair.</b>

43:42.709 --> 43:43.918
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

43:44.000 --> 43:45.042
<b>Any song?</b>

43:45.125 --> 43:46.292
