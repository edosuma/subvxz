WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:05.458
[instrumental music]

00:16.000 --> 00:17.167
Is everything ready?

00:17.250 --> 00:19.625
Yes, the Royal Liner
is standing by

00:19.708 --> 00:21.667
and we have adequate warships
for protection

00:21.750 --> 00:25.208
and they're prepared to set
forth as soon as we arrive.

00:25.292 --> 00:28.417
As soon as I arrive.
You will remain here.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.167
I must protest, Majesty.

00:30.250 --> 00:33.208
As I expected,
but someone has to remain here

00:33.292 --> 00:35.125
in case there is a crisis.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.750
And you, as my prime minister

00:36.833 --> 00:38.792
are the first
in line of authority.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.625
I wish
you would change your mind.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.458
'The doctors say
your condition's very delicate.'

00:43.542 --> 00:44.792
The least amount of stress--

00:44.875 --> 00:47.292
All the more reason
why I should go now

00:47.375 --> 00:48.833
while I still can.

00:48.917 --> 00:51.750
What I must do
cannot wait any longer.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.167
Oh. No need for that now.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.167
When you get to be as old as I

00:58.250 --> 00:59.458
the trappings of status

00:59.542 --> 01:01.250
are not as important
as they used to be.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.917
Sometimes I think
our women are right

01:03.000 --> 01:05.875
when they shave their heads
and rise above these things.

01:05.958 --> 01:06.958
Majesty.

01:07.042 --> 01:09.542
I will go among them as I am.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.917
There's no need
for further discussion.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.625
'You have always served me well,
old friend.'

01:14.708 --> 01:16.917
And sometimes I think

01:17.000 --> 01:19.083
I do not thank you
as much as I should.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.750
Goodbye.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.208
[instrumental music]

01:38.708 --> 01:41.167
(G'Kar)
It's absolutely intolerable.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.708
This visit
by the Centauri Emperor

01:42.792 --> 01:45.125
is completely unacceptable
to my government.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.458
He is a monster

01:46.542 --> 01:49.167
a-an aberration, a-a criminal!

01:49.250 --> 01:51.333
His family
is directly responsible

01:51.417 --> 01:52.750
for strip-mining my world.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.750
His father
personally ordered the execution

01:55.833 --> 01:57.208
of a 100,000 Narns!

01:57.292 --> 02:00.417
But he himself did nothing,
am I correct?

02:00.500 --> 02:01.958
A technicality!

02:02.042 --> 02:03.875
In fact, unless I'm mistaken

02:03.958 --> 02:06.375
the current emperor
has gone out of his way

02:06.458 --> 02:08.542
to offer your world concessions

02:08.625 --> 02:10.792
and return lost territory.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.708
- Stolen territory!
- Whatever.

02:13.792 --> 02:14.958
Look.

02:17.958 --> 02:19.875
I appreciate the fact

02:19.958 --> 02:21.583
that 100 years of blood

02:21.667 --> 02:23.750
isn't something
you forget overnight

02:23.833 --> 02:25.375
'but the bottom line is, G'Kar'

02:25.458 --> 02:27.708
that is not my problem.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.917
'This station
is open to everyone.'

02:30.000 --> 02:33.708
Now, if the emperor wants
to come and visit Babylon 5

02:33.792 --> 02:35.083
I think it's great!

02:36.458 --> 02:38.042
It raises her visibility

02:38.125 --> 02:39.792
and it helps the folks back home

02:39.875 --> 02:43.125
think that maybe
we're doing some good.

02:43.208 --> 02:48.000
So you're going to allow this
even over my objections?

02:48.083 --> 02:51.958
Well, what, did I suddenly
turn invisible or something?

02:52.042 --> 02:54.083
Yes, ambassador.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.583
The emperor
is allowed to come aboard.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.042
'Now, if this bothers you'

02:58.125 --> 03:01.000
'I suggest
you stay in your quarters'

03:01.083 --> 03:02.250
stick your fingers in your ears

03:02.333 --> 03:05.542
and hum real loud
until it's over.

03:05.625 --> 03:06.833
Unless you'd like
to try something

03:06.917 --> 03:08.458
as breathtakingly rational

03:08.542 --> 03:11.583
as trying to open up a dialogue.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.500
G'Kar, you are in a position

03:14.583 --> 03:15.875
to negotiate directly

03:15.958 --> 03:18.333
with the head
of the Centauri Republic!

03:18.417 --> 03:21.708
And you're wasting it
on a-a-a tantrum.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.625
[sighs]

03:23.708 --> 03:26.500
I shouldn't have expected you
to understand, captain.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.500
My mistake.
I will not make it again.

03:31.583 --> 03:32.750
'G'Kar.'

03:34.750 --> 03:37.000
Don't do something
we'll both regret.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.833
It's too late for that, captain

03:40.917 --> 03:42.625
too late by far.

03:50.375 --> 03:51.625
(male narrator)
The Babylon project

03:51.708 --> 03:55.500
was our last best hope
for peace..

03:55.583 --> 03:58.625
...a self-contained world
five miles long

03:58.708 --> 04:01.000
located in neutral territory..

04:04.333 --> 04:06.458
...a place of commerce
and diplomacy

04:06.542 --> 04:10.167
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens

04:10.250 --> 04:13.375
a shining beacon in space

04:13.458 --> 04:15.500
all alone in the night.

04:15.583 --> 04:19.000
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

04:19.083 --> 04:23.375
the year the great war
came upon us all.

04:23.458 --> 04:27.333
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

04:27.417 --> 04:29.583
The year is 2259

04:29.667 --> 04:32.625
the name of the place
is Babylon 5.

04:32.708 --> 04:35.750
[theme music]

05:05.000 --> 05:08.083
[music continues]

05:18.750 --> 05:21.542
[droning]

05:26.375 --> 05:29.458
[indistinct chattering]

05:32.708 --> 05:35.667
Oh, back again, eh?
That's three times this month.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.625
- I do a lot of business here.
- Anything I can help you with?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.375
No, thank you.
I've found what I'm looking for.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
[crackling]

05:54.417 --> 05:57.583
And after the emperor
has made his speech

05:57.667 --> 06:00.792
I've arranged for him
to give you an audience.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.458
The whole thing
will be recorded.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.083
Does he know what it's about?

06:05.167 --> 06:07.625
He believes it's nothing more
than a progress report

06:07.708 --> 06:09.375
on your situation here.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.958
We've taken the liberty
of writing your speech for you.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.125
I've had experts
in psycholinguistics

06:17.208 --> 06:19.000
working on it for weeks.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.333
It's perfect.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.292
Fiery, but dignified

06:24.375 --> 06:26.042
'elegant, but strong.'

06:26.125 --> 06:28.292
It outlines the decline
of our government

06:28.375 --> 06:30.167
and our need for change.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.208
It also makes a few predictions

06:32.292 --> 06:34.042
about what will go wrong next

06:34.125 --> 06:35.792
with the economy
and the military.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.958
And these predictions,
they will come true?

06:38.042 --> 06:39.750
Already arranged.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.375
Sabotage?

06:42.458 --> 06:44.292
'Hm, a word or two
in the right ear'

06:44.375 --> 06:46.958
a critical
food shipment delayed.

06:47.042 --> 06:48.333
The method is unimportant.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.708
What matters
is that when it comes through

06:50.792 --> 06:53.333
the emperor will look
weak and shortsighted

06:53.417 --> 06:55.583
whereas we have
our eyes on the future.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.333
Well, you're..

06:58.417 --> 07:00.542
You're asking quite a lot of me.

07:02.292 --> 07:04.042
After I make this speech

07:04.125 --> 07:05.292
I won't exactly be in favor

07:05.375 --> 07:07.792
with the emperor
and his court, hm?

07:07.875 --> 07:10.625
True, for as long as he's alive

07:10.708 --> 07:12.000
which shouldn't be much longer.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.292
I am told his health
is fragile at best.

07:15.375 --> 07:18.042
When he passes,
all that will remain

07:18.125 --> 07:20.417
is the memory
that we were right.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.333
We must position ourselves

07:22.417 --> 07:24.833
'to move in
when the time is right.'

07:24.917 --> 07:27.833
Well, I will leave you
to study the speech.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.458
If you have any questions,
you know where to find me.

07:41.208 --> 07:44.708
This conversation
makes you uncomfortable?

07:44.792 --> 07:47.083
Yes. Yes, it does!

07:47.167 --> 07:50.875
Then for once
we have something in common.

07:50.958 --> 07:54.000
[instrumental music]

08:23.750 --> 08:26.250
On behalf
of the Centauri Republic

08:26.333 --> 08:29.083
I offer the hands of friendship.

08:29.167 --> 08:32.250
On behalf
of the Earth Alliance, I accept.

08:33.708 --> 08:36.583
This is my second,
Commander Susan Ivanova.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.917
'Chief of security,
Michael Garibaldi.'

08:39.000 --> 08:40.250
'Dr. Stephen Franklin'

08:40.333 --> 08:42.542
'the chief of staff
of our medlab facility.'

08:42.625 --> 08:44.125
(Emperor)
It's an honor.

08:44.208 --> 08:46.083
News of the work
you're doing here

08:46.167 --> 08:48.417
has reached
even the Royal Palace

08:48.500 --> 08:50.125
on Centauri Prime.

08:50.208 --> 08:53.833
'And I'm deeply moved
by the knowledge'

08:53.917 --> 08:56.792
'that you would
choose to stand in harm's way'

08:56.875 --> 08:58.667
'in the interest of peace.'

08:58.750 --> 09:00.208
Thank you.

09:00.292 --> 09:03.792
If you'd like to come this way,
we can begin your tour.

09:03.875 --> 09:07.458
Oh, uh, doctor, have you seen
much of the Vorlon?

09:07.542 --> 09:09.375
I believe his name is Kosh.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.583
Uh, no more than anyone else.

09:11.667 --> 09:15.000
He's-he's always in that
encounter suit of his. Why?

09:15.083 --> 09:17.708
Uh, I've never seen
a Vorlon before

09:17.792 --> 09:19.417
in or out of its shell

09:19.500 --> 09:20.833
but over the centuries

09:20.917 --> 09:24.208
we've sent many expeditions
into Vorlon space.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.083
None of them returned.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.500
I have heard
many strange stories about them.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.833
The first circle of the Kha'Ri

09:31.917 --> 09:34.208
have concluded
their deliberations.

09:34.292 --> 09:36.750
After much debate
they have endorsed your plan.

09:36.833 --> 09:39.875
When does the Kha'Ri feel
would be the best time?

09:39.958 --> 09:41.292
The reception

09:41.375 --> 09:43.417
just before he gives his speech.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.083
There will be greater exposure.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.208
Are you still prepared
to go through with this?

09:48.292 --> 09:50.000
Yes.

09:50.083 --> 09:53.000
It is a strange feeling,
Kha'Mak, to know suddenly

09:53.083 --> 09:55.375
that all the decisions
in your life

09:55.458 --> 09:58.083
have brought you to this place..

09:58.167 --> 10:02.000
...that there is no longer
doubt or uncertainty.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.833
The future now consists
of only three probabilities.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.792
'In the moment that I strike'

10:19.875 --> 10:23.125
the emperor and I will both die

10:23.208 --> 10:27.167
for he will die and I will
spend my life in prison

10:27.250 --> 10:29.458
or I will fail and be killed.

10:30.792 --> 10:34.333
For the first time in my life
the path is clear.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.458
[instrumental music]

10:45.958 --> 10:47.333
Your Majesty

10:47.417 --> 10:49.542
you asked to see me?

10:49.625 --> 10:52.083
Captain, may I ask you
a question?

10:52.167 --> 10:54.417
Depends on the question,
I guess.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.000
Why are you here

10:56.083 --> 10:59.375
in this place, in that uniform?

10:59.458 --> 11:02.500
Was it your choice or were you
pressed into service?

11:02.583 --> 11:04.625
It was my choice.

11:04.708 --> 11:07.375
The planetary draft
didn't start until the war

11:07.458 --> 11:08.917
a few years later.

11:10.167 --> 11:12.250
I guess
I wanted to serve something

11:12.333 --> 11:14.750
that was bigger than I was..

11:14.833 --> 11:17.417
'...make a difference somewhere,
somehow.'

11:17.500 --> 11:20.750
You seem interested
in why people chose to be here.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.125
It has occurred to me recently

11:22.208 --> 11:25.083
that I have
never chosen anything.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.542
'I was born into a role'

11:26.625 --> 11:28.958
'that had been prepared for me.'

11:29.042 --> 11:31.375
I did everything
I was asked to do

11:31.458 --> 11:34.625
because it never occurred to me

11:34.708 --> 11:37.375
to choose otherwise.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.000
And now, at the end of my life..

11:41.542 --> 11:43.875
...I wonder
what might have been.

11:43.958 --> 11:46.042
That's why my father taught me
to live each second

11:46.125 --> 11:48.292
as though it were
the last moment of my life.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.792
He said..

11:51.875 --> 11:53.292
..."If you love

11:53.375 --> 11:54.792
"love without reservation.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.542
"If you fight

11:56.625 --> 11:58.000
fight without fear."

11:59.708 --> 12:02.167
He called it
the way of the warrior.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.625
No regrets, then?

12:03.708 --> 12:06.208
A few, but just a few.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.208
- You?
- Oh.

12:09.292 --> 12:11.250
Enough to fill a lifetime.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.458
So much has been lost

12:13.542 --> 12:15.083
so much forgotten.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.833
So much pain, so much blood.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.875
And for what?

12:19.958 --> 12:21.500
I wonder.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.167
The past tempts us

12:23.250 --> 12:25.125
the present confuses us

12:25.208 --> 12:27.167
and the future frightens us.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.333
And our lives slip away

12:29.417 --> 12:31.125
moment by moment

12:31.208 --> 12:34.375
lost in that vast,
terrible in-between.

12:35.583 --> 12:36.750
But there is still time

12:36.833 --> 12:41.167
to seize
that one, last, fragile moment

12:41.250 --> 12:43.167
to choose something better

12:43.250 --> 12:45.417
to make a difference,
as you say.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.333
And I intend to do just that.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.208
(Garibaldi)
I want this
whole section cleared.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.667
I want every entrance and exit
checked and rechecked.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.167
They'll be down any second.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.417
So from now on, nobody gets in
without proper ID.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.917
I don't care if you recognize
them by sight or not.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.167
(G'Kar)
I take this action
without the knowledge

13:05.250 --> 13:07.667
or permission of my government.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.083
Neither should my aide, Na'Toth

13:09.167 --> 13:12.208
be held accountable
for my actions.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.958
The responsibility
is mine alone.

13:17.583 --> 13:20.375
I ask that my remains
and my personal property

13:20.458 --> 13:22.583
be sent back to Narn..

13:23.750 --> 13:25.250
...to my family.

13:28.125 --> 13:31.292
My copy of "The Book Of G'Quan"
I leave to Na'Toth

13:31.375 --> 13:34.417
in the hope
of her eventual enlightenment.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.917
[indistinct chattering]

13:44.625 --> 13:46.917
(John)
'So what's the deal
on those veiled Centauri women'

13:47.000 --> 13:48.167
'who follow the emperor around?'

13:48.250 --> 13:49.875
Well, Londo says
they're telepaths

13:49.958 --> 13:51.375
raised together since birth.

13:51.458 --> 13:52.917
They're linked 24 hours a day

13:53.000 --> 13:54.250
no matter
how far apart they are.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.917
What one sees, the others see.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.417
And traditionally,
when the emperor leaves

13:58.500 --> 14:00.542
two go with him
and two stay behind.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.125
- Interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.292
Guarantees that he knows
what's going on back home

14:04.375 --> 14:07.750
and keeps the royal court
up to speed on what he's doing.

14:07.833 --> 14:10.417
And did the-the emperor say what
this important speech was about?

14:10.500 --> 14:12.042
No, he just said
it was important.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.375
I was hoping
that would be enough

14:13.458 --> 14:15.042
to bring out Ambassador Kosh.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.625
Looks like I was wrong.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.333
Yeah, it's too bad considering
what the emperor said

14:18.417 --> 14:19.542
about the Vorlons.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.875
He might not get another chance
to see one.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.583
But I guess
it was too much to hope for.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.667
Well, speaking
too much to hope for

14:26.750 --> 14:28.917
look what just walked in.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.042
[dramatic music]

14:35.333 --> 14:36.708
Excuse me.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.583
- Ambassador.
- Captain.

14:39.667 --> 14:42.625
I see you've changed your mind
about opening up a dialogue.

14:42.708 --> 14:46.500
I make no promises, but I will
hear what he has to say.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.708
[dramatic music]

14:58.875 --> 15:00.167
[buzzing]

15:00.250 --> 15:02.958
Okay, pal, you've got
ten seconds to explain

15:03.042 --> 15:04.750
why you're following me.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.250
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

15:06.333 --> 15:08.250
- I..
- Relax, I got him.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.833
So talk.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.125
[sighs]

15:11.208 --> 15:12.708
That's what I figured.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.167
Take him down to holding
and keep him there

15:14.250 --> 15:16.542
until the reception's over.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.625
[indistinct chattering]

15:27.125 --> 15:30.167
[dramatic music]

15:49.625 --> 15:52.708
[music continues]

16:05.458 --> 16:08.500
[indistinct chattering]

16:17.125 --> 16:20.125
[dramatic music]

16:43.417 --> 16:45.625
Your Majesty.

16:45.708 --> 16:48.208
I wish I'd known of your
condition when you arrived.

16:48.292 --> 16:51.042
I could have done something,
tried something.

16:52.292 --> 16:53.458
Your government
is asking to

16:53.542 --> 16:55.167
have you transferred
to your warship.

16:55.250 --> 16:58.083
Now, I told them that moving
you right now could be fatal.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.250
I want your permission.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.208
There is something
more important

17:02.292 --> 17:04.333
than where I die.

17:05.417 --> 17:09.333
A message
you must give for me.

17:09.417 --> 17:10.667
Well, if it's important

17:10.750 --> 17:13.417
perhaps, one of your own people
should deliver it.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.208
If I did that

17:15.292 --> 17:17.625
the message
might never be delivered.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.458
Now, listen to me, doctor.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.542
'Listen carefully.'

17:22.625 --> 17:24.875
I hear, word of this
has already reached homeworld.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.917
Hm, our competitors
are moving into position

17:28.000 --> 17:30.125
setting themselves up
to ascend the throne

17:30.208 --> 17:32.333
the moment he dies.

17:32.417 --> 17:36.000
Before that happens, we have
to rise above the others.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.042
We must do
something extraordinary

17:38.125 --> 17:41.542
something....unparalleled.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.625
He said, "Just pick a target."

17:44.708 --> 17:46.333
I'm sorry?

17:46.417 --> 17:48.542
I believe there is a Narn colony

17:48.625 --> 17:52.083
on the border of Centauri space,
Quadrant 14.

17:52.167 --> 17:53.958
- Londo?
- A colony?

17:54.042 --> 17:55.208
It's a listening post.

17:55.292 --> 17:57.125
They've been using it
to spy on us for years.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.958
By all rights, that entire
planet should be ours.

18:00.042 --> 18:01.542
Well, then..

18:01.625 --> 18:04.083
...let us take it back.

18:04.167 --> 18:07.000
We couldn't take it
without a major assault.

18:07.083 --> 18:08.458
We would lose
thousands of lives.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.208
I will take care of it.

18:10.292 --> 18:12.208
Have your contacts
in the military

18:12.292 --> 18:14.625
send an expedition
to Quadrant 14.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.250
I can only guarantee
a few ships.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.750
Alright. It will be enough.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.250
I hope you know
what you're doing, Mollari.

18:24.792 --> 18:25.917
[sighs]

18:27.958 --> 18:30.417
Find Mr. Morden.
Bring him here.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.542
Londo, don't do this.

18:32.625 --> 18:35.000
- I have no choice!
- Yes, you do!

18:35.083 --> 18:36.750
Londo, please! Please, please!

18:36.833 --> 18:38.167
I know you don't listen to me

18:38.250 --> 18:40.292
but I'm asking you
just this one time

18:40.375 --> 18:42.500
don't do this!

18:42.583 --> 18:45.125
Uh, there's no turning back
once you start down that road.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.458
Do I have to go find him myself?

18:51.625 --> 18:53.375
No.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.042
No, I'll go.

18:55.125 --> 18:58.083
I'll go and I'll bring him back.

18:58.167 --> 19:02.042
And someday I'm gonna remind you
of this conversation.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.292
And maybe then,
then you'll understand.

19:05.375 --> 19:08.375
I understand just fine.

19:10.292 --> 19:13.500
By this time tomorrow
we will be at war with the Narn.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.833
May the great maker forgive me.

19:21.792 --> 19:24.250
[instrumental music]

19:29.500 --> 19:32.333
I was ready.
I had prepared myself.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.917
I had made my peace
with the universe

19:35.000 --> 19:36.958
put all my affairs in order.

19:37.042 --> 19:40.500
I had the dagger in my hand!

19:40.583 --> 19:42.417
And he has the indecency

19:42.500 --> 19:44.958
to start dying on his own.

19:45.042 --> 19:47.750
Never in my life have I seen
a worse case of timing.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.208
Well, you'd think
he could have waited

19:49.292 --> 19:50.458
a few more minutes before..

19:50.542 --> 19:51.583
[beeping]

19:51.667 --> 19:54.250
- Who is it?
- 'Dr. Franklin.'

19:58.167 --> 19:59.292
Maybe it's good news.

19:59.375 --> 20:00.875
With luck, he's feeling better.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.458
All they have to do is prop him
up for two minutes, I..

20:03.542 --> 20:05.208
I'll call you back.

20:05.292 --> 20:06.500
Uh, uh..

20:14.333 --> 20:15.292
Enter.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.708
[door opens]

20:20.542 --> 20:23.542
Just came from seeing
the Centauri emperor.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.750
How is the poor fellow?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.958
I was so looking forward
to meeting him

20:28.042 --> 20:30.958
and opening up a dialogue.

20:31.042 --> 20:33.458
Funny, he was looking forward
to meeting you, too.

20:33.542 --> 20:34.750
'He had a message for you.'

20:34.833 --> 20:36.417
Given his present condition he
asked me

20:36.500 --> 20:38.000
to relay that message for him.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.917
I have no time for threats.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.083
He wanted to say he's sorry.

20:44.458 --> 20:45.292
What?

20:45.375 --> 20:47.000
He came all the way out here

20:47.083 --> 20:49.417
risked his health
and endangered his life

20:49.500 --> 20:53.083
so that he could stand beside
a Narn in neutral territory

20:53.167 --> 20:55.667
and apologize for all the things

20:55.750 --> 20:58.500
the Centauri have done
to your people..

20:58.583 --> 21:00.750
...for all the things
his family did.

21:02.667 --> 21:03.917
He said..

21:05.917 --> 21:08.333
..."We were wrong.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.167
'"The hatred between our people
can never end'

21:10.250 --> 21:12.625
'"until someone
is willing to say'

21:12.708 --> 21:14.833
'"I'm sorry..'

21:14.917 --> 21:17.958
'"...and try and find a way
to make things right again'

21:18.042 --> 21:20.333
to atone for our actions."

21:22.292 --> 21:24.958
He said it was the only choice
he ever made in his life

21:25.042 --> 21:28.208
and now that seems to have been
taken away from him.

21:28.292 --> 21:30.500
I had..

21:30.583 --> 21:33.958
- I had no idea.
- No, I'm sure you didn't.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.083
Maybe that's the biggest tragedy
of the whole damn story.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.500
(Refa)
Keep this up, G'Kar

21:51.583 --> 21:54.042
and soon you won't have
a planet to protect.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.083
[coughing]

22:29.583 --> 22:31.125
[grunting]

22:32.667 --> 22:34.667
[groaning]

22:40.500 --> 22:41.833
The time?

22:42.625 --> 22:44.542
What is the time?

22:48.542 --> 22:50.292
It has begun.

23:05.167 --> 23:08.208
[explosion]

23:16.000 --> 23:16.917
[explosion]

23:17.000 --> 23:19.083
Attack! All wings, attack!

23:33.042 --> 23:35.833
'Shrak, where are they
coming from?'

23:35.917 --> 23:37.750
'What are they?'

23:42.833 --> 23:45.042
'Keep them away
from the colony.'

23:50.583 --> 23:52.708
'We can't let them get past us!'

23:55.375 --> 23:58.417
[explosion]

24:11.167 --> 24:13.208
[explosions]

24:29.708 --> 24:30.958
You're sure it's done?

24:31.042 --> 24:33.417
Yes, the Narn
should hear about it soon.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.375
Our forces
can move in at anytime.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.458
Then I'll have to move quickly.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.000
There's still one more thing

24:39.083 --> 24:41.458
I have to take care of back home

24:41.542 --> 24:43.167
an obstacle to remove.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.208
What's that?

24:45.292 --> 24:47.333
Better you don't know.

24:51.583 --> 24:52.792
Mollari!

24:54.958 --> 24:58.042
- You!
- No, I can explain everything.

24:58.125 --> 25:01.083
I'm going to get you a drink.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.833
- Oh, no, I don't--
- Sit, sit, sit, sit, Mollari.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.958
It's not every day
I have a revelation, you know?

25:08.042 --> 25:10.167
Two of your finest.

25:10.250 --> 25:13.333
I've heard something
and it makes me think

25:13.417 --> 25:16.417
there is still hope for us
after all.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.375
I'd believed your people capable

25:18.458 --> 25:21.583
of only murder and pain..

25:23.333 --> 25:27.667
...but apparently,
there's still a spark of decency

25:27.750 --> 25:29.625
in your genetic code.

25:29.708 --> 25:32.500
It's not much of a foundation,
I'll grant you that, but..

25:34.375 --> 25:36.583
...it's a start!

25:36.667 --> 25:39.375
Ah, I never thought
I would be saying this, Mollari

25:39.458 --> 25:40.500
but..

25:42.292 --> 25:44.875
...to the health of your emperor

25:44.958 --> 25:48.167
and perhaps,
to your health as well.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.708
[glasses clinking]

25:52.792 --> 25:54.458
To the emperor.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.583
And thank you.

26:14.792 --> 26:16.833
[dramatic music]

26:17.833 --> 26:19.875
[crackling]

26:26.583 --> 26:28.500
(Kha'Mak)
It's destroyed?

26:28.583 --> 26:29.833
All of it's gone.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.708
'Who could have done this?'

26:34.792 --> 26:36.333
(male #1)
'Centauri warships detected.'

26:36.417 --> 26:39.833
- 'Closing fast.'
- Centauri.

26:39.917 --> 26:42.292
Alert the homeworld.
Prepare to attack.

26:58.792 --> 27:01.458
Who is it? Who's there?

27:01.542 --> 27:03.208
Guards! Guards!

27:03.292 --> 27:05.083
[groaning]

27:10.375 --> 27:12.625
Chief, the prisoner's
asking to speak to you again.

27:12.708 --> 27:14.292
Oh, come on, Zack,
give me a break.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.292
You know the kind
of day it's been.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.583
- He says it's important.
- Oh.

27:18.667 --> 27:22.083
Okay, fine. Send him in.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.583
Oh, man.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.208
Alright, you got five minutes.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.542
I was sent to find you.

27:39.625 --> 27:40.917
I have a message.

27:44.875 --> 27:47.208
I believe
it will explain everything.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.375
Play.

27:59.458 --> 28:02.458
Hello, old friend.
It's been a while.

28:07.458 --> 28:08.917
I'm entrusting this message
to an associate of mine

28:09.000 --> 28:11.375
who has sworn
to bring it to you at any cost

28:11.458 --> 28:13.083
'including his own life.'

28:13.167 --> 28:14.833
'My job on
the Minbari homeworld'

28:14.917 --> 28:17.083
is more than just
representing Earth.

28:17.167 --> 28:19.542
The president doesn't know
about that part yet

28:19.625 --> 28:23.792
and I don't think it to be
wise for you tell him.

28:23.875 --> 28:26.417
'There's a great darkness
coming, Michael.'

28:26.500 --> 28:30.083
Some of the Minbari have been
waiting for it a long time.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.750
Captain!

28:32.833 --> 28:34.625
We just intercepted a message
from the Narn homeworld

28:34.708 --> 28:35.958
to Ambassador G'Kar.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.958
I thought we didn't eavesdrop
on our ambassadors.

28:38.042 --> 28:39.667
We don't.
This was on an open channel.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.750
I think
they wanted us to hear it.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.958
The Centauri have launched
a full-scale assault

28:44.042 --> 28:46.625
on a Narn colony in Quadrant 14.

28:46.708 --> 28:47.958
Damn it!

28:48.042 --> 28:51.333
The bearer of this message
s one of my rangers.

28:51.417 --> 28:53.417
'Some are Minbari,
most are humans.'

28:53.500 --> 28:56.542
They've been drawn here
to learn to work together

28:56.625 --> 28:58.375
and prepare for the fight ahead.

28:58.458 --> 28:59.792
(Garibaldi)
Pause.

28:59.875 --> 29:02.042
We've been here
for almost two months now

29:02.125 --> 29:03.875
keeping an eye on things.

29:03.958 --> 29:06.792
We are an army, Mr. Garibaldi.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.375
We're small, but we're growing.

29:08.458 --> 29:10.458
An army needs weapons.
Are they coming through here?

29:10.542 --> 29:13.750
No, but we do have friends here.

29:13.833 --> 29:16.125
And that's all
I can say for now.

29:18.583 --> 29:19.792
Resume.

29:19.875 --> 29:23.333
Their job for now
is to patrol the frontier

29:23.417 --> 29:26.167
to listen, to watch

29:26.250 --> 29:27.542
and return with reports

29:27.625 --> 29:30.958
too sensitive to entrust
to regular channels.

29:32.083 --> 29:34.917
'They are my eyes and ears.'

29:35.875 --> 29:39.125
Where you see them, you see me.

29:39.208 --> 29:42.667
The first reports
from Quadrant 14 were confused.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.542
They weren't sure
who was attacking them

29:44.625 --> 29:46.333
but the returning fighters
confirmed

29:46.417 --> 29:49.125
that Centauri warships
were leading the assault.

29:49.208 --> 29:50.542
What about our people?

29:50.625 --> 29:52.833
There were over
a quarter million of us there.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.208
There were heavy casualties.

29:55.292 --> 29:56.750
Most of those killed

29:56.833 --> 29:59.375
died in the first few minutes
of the assault.

30:00.917 --> 30:02.875
'As for the survivors'

30:02.958 --> 30:05.208
well, you know
how the Centauri are.

30:05.292 --> 30:06.542
Now that they've taken control

30:06.625 --> 30:08.958
I doubt that we'll see
any of them again.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.625
I don't understand

30:12.708 --> 30:15.583
how they could have destroyed
our defenses so quickly.

30:15.667 --> 30:17.958
I'll report more
when I learn of it.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.458
[sighs]

30:28.000 --> 30:30.083
I reached out my hand..

30:31.750 --> 30:33.958
...and he betrayed me.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.875
He knew..

30:37.917 --> 30:39.917
...and he betrayed me!

30:40.000 --> 30:42.083
[glass shattering]

30:42.833 --> 30:45.833
[grunting]

30:47.542 --> 30:48.750
In the name of our friendship

30:48.833 --> 30:49.917
I ask that you give them

30:50.000 --> 30:52.583
every courtesy and cooperation.

30:52.667 --> 30:55.083
'I wish I could tell you more.'

30:55.167 --> 30:57.750
'I wish I could warn you.'

30:57.833 --> 31:00.583
But the others don't think
it's time yet.

31:00.667 --> 31:03.625
Stay close to the Vorlon..

31:03.708 --> 31:05.792
...and watch out for shadows.

31:05.875 --> 31:09.792
They move
when you're not looking at them.

31:09.875 --> 31:11.167
Well, I'll be a son of a..

31:11.250 --> 31:12.667
[beeping]

31:12.750 --> 31:13.750
Yeah?

31:13.833 --> 31:14.875
(Zack)
'We've got a yellow alert'

31:14.958 --> 31:16.083
'in the ambassadorial wing.'

31:16.167 --> 31:18.458
'We need help fast. It's G..'

31:18.542 --> 31:20.625
Zack? Zack?

31:20.708 --> 31:23.042
[grunting]

31:23.125 --> 31:24.125
[groaning]

31:24.208 --> 31:25.583
[grunting]

31:25.667 --> 31:27.292
Mollari!

31:29.542 --> 31:30.792
Mollari!

31:30.875 --> 31:32.167
That's far enough.

31:32.250 --> 31:35.167
'Go to your quarters
and no charges will be pressed.'

31:35.250 --> 31:36.792
I mean it, G'Kar.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.708
You will go to your quarters
and you will go now.

31:39.792 --> 31:42.167
They're doing it to us again.

31:42.250 --> 31:43.833
Step aside, Sheridan.

31:43.917 --> 31:46.125
I won't let this happen,
not again!

31:46.208 --> 31:48.792
Then you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

31:51.833 --> 31:54.625
Set one foot in
Ambassador Mollari's quarters

31:54.708 --> 31:57.167
you'll either be dead or gone.

31:57.250 --> 32:00.625
Either way,
you won't help your people.

32:00.708 --> 32:04.125
They'll kill everyone,
don't you understand?

32:04.208 --> 32:06.583
They've done it before!
They'll kill everyone!

32:06.667 --> 32:07.958
Then you're gonna have to decide

32:08.042 --> 32:11.167
what's more important
to you, G'Kar..

32:11.250 --> 32:13.875
...revenge or saving
the lives of your people.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.833
[grunting]

32:18.917 --> 32:21.917
[sobbing]

32:24.083 --> 32:26.042
No, leave him alone.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.375
Just...leave him alone.

32:37.292 --> 32:40.333
[beeping]

32:42.375 --> 32:44.875
It's okay. Easy.

32:44.958 --> 32:47.083
You should try
and save your strength.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.042
Is there anything that you want?

32:50.125 --> 32:52.917
I would very much like

32:53.000 --> 32:55.083
to have seen a Vorlon.

33:15.458 --> 33:17.542
How will this end?

33:19.625 --> 33:21.625
In fire.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.333
What makes you think you can
trust this source of yours?

33:32.417 --> 33:34.375
Let's just say
he comes highly recommended.

33:34.458 --> 33:36.917
- You're holding something back.
- Yes, sir.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.375
- Why?
- I gave my word.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.667
You're asking me to accept
sensitive information

33:44.750 --> 33:47.000
without any idea
where it comes from.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.917
I could order you to tell me.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.708
And if I told you,
you'd never be able trust me

33:52.792 --> 33:54.500
with anything confidential
knowing that

33:54.583 --> 33:56.625
someone above you
could order me talk.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.667
Alright, go on.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.458
Ever since New Year's,
we've been hearing about

34:02.542 --> 34:04.208
some other major race
on the prowl.

34:04.292 --> 34:06.167
My source tells me
the rumors are true

34:06.250 --> 34:08.375
and there maybe some link
to the Centauri government.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.750
'Now, who or what that link is,
I don't know'

34:10.833 --> 34:12.917
but they're definitely
getting support.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.125
And you think this other race

34:14.208 --> 34:16.167
was behind that assault
on Quadrant 14?

34:16.250 --> 34:17.375
It's possible.

34:17.458 --> 34:18.792
If it's true, they won't want

34:18.875 --> 34:20.458
that information to get out.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.458
What information?
All we have here is supposition.

34:22.542 --> 34:24.333
Sheridan's rule number 29

34:24.417 --> 34:25.792
always make your opponent think

34:25.875 --> 34:28.500
you know more
than you really know.

34:28.583 --> 34:29.833
'Now, if your source is right'

34:29.917 --> 34:32.042
we may be able to play a bluff.

34:33.417 --> 34:36.917
Majesty, we have wonderful news.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.500
We have retaken the Narn Colony

34:39.583 --> 34:41.542
in Quadrant 14.

34:41.625 --> 34:44.375
'It fell within
a matter of hours'

34:44.458 --> 34:46.833
'and not one of our people
was hurt'

34:46.917 --> 34:49.583
or killed in the process.

34:49.667 --> 34:52.500
All of homeworld is rejoicing.

34:52.583 --> 34:55.792
We are again what we should be.

34:55.875 --> 34:59.083
All we lack is your blessing.

35:18.958 --> 35:22.000
[whispering]

35:27.333 --> 35:29.083
[beeping]

35:32.833 --> 35:34.167
He's dead.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.125
What did he say?

35:38.833 --> 35:41.625
He said, "Continue.

35:42.750 --> 35:46.792
Take my people
back to the stars."

36:03.292 --> 36:05.250
[door shuts]

36:05.333 --> 36:07.250
Mollari.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.625
What did he say, really?

36:11.167 --> 36:12.833
He said..

36:14.208 --> 36:16.792
...that we are both damned.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.917
Well..

36:21.000 --> 36:24.250
It's a small enough price
to pay for immortality.

36:25.167 --> 36:27.167
[laughing]

36:33.708 --> 36:36.750
[dramatic music]

36:41.958 --> 36:43.958
[door opens]

36:44.042 --> 36:47.125
[footsteps approaching]

36:49.333 --> 36:50.833
(John)
'Ambassador?'

36:59.875 --> 37:03.417
We think we have an idea
of how we can help.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.792
'I've called a council meeting.'

37:05.875 --> 37:07.958
'I hope you'll come.'

37:13.875 --> 37:15.292
Sheridan.

37:17.250 --> 37:19.417
I will attend.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.000
Thank you..

37:22.792 --> 37:24.875
...for stopping me.

37:30.792 --> 37:32.083
[sighs]

37:37.667 --> 37:41.500
Ambassador Mollari, what about
the Narn civilian population?

37:41.583 --> 37:43.625
I'm told there are over
a quarter of a million of them

37:43.708 --> 37:45.125
at the colony.

37:45.208 --> 37:47.583
Now, will you let them
return to the Narn homeworld?

37:47.667 --> 37:50.167
Oh, no,
I'm afraid we can't do that

37:50.250 --> 37:51.625
but I am sure that my government

37:51.708 --> 37:54.292
will find some productive
activity for them.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.917
Forced labor camps.

38:01.792 --> 38:03.708
A simple retraining.

38:03.792 --> 38:06.667
We have no desire
to misuse anyone.

38:19.167 --> 38:21.792
I should mention that
I've just received permission

38:21.875 --> 38:23.250
by my government

38:23.333 --> 38:25.000
to send observers to the colony.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.958
Their job will be
to monitor the treatment

38:27.042 --> 38:28.375
of the civilian population.

38:28.458 --> 38:29.875
They are not welcome.

38:29.958 --> 38:31.542
But we're sending them anyway

38:31.625 --> 38:32.875
unless you'd like
to try shooting down

38:32.958 --> 38:34.625
an Earthforce transport.

38:34.708 --> 38:37.708
Personally,
I'd advise against it.

38:37.792 --> 38:40.583
My people
aren't looking for another war

38:40.667 --> 38:43.667
but they don't take kindly
to being shot at.

38:43.750 --> 38:46.042
The observers
will assess the situation

38:46.125 --> 38:48.708
interview the survivors

38:48.792 --> 38:50.750
and put together a full report

38:50.833 --> 38:53.042
including as much as
they can find out

38:53.125 --> 38:55.333
about how the colony
was conquered

38:55.417 --> 38:57.083
so quickly.

38:57.167 --> 38:58.750
I'm sure we'd all be interested
to find out

38:58.833 --> 39:00.083
how you did this, ambassador.

39:00.167 --> 39:03.750
And trust me, if those observers
do go there..

39:05.042 --> 39:07.125
...they will find out.

39:09.625 --> 39:11.208
I believe..

39:12.833 --> 39:16.417
I believe that I may be able
to convince my government

39:16.500 --> 39:19.750
to allow the colony's civilian
population to leave the area

39:19.833 --> 39:22.500
and safely return
to the Narn homeworld

39:22.583 --> 39:25.083
as a gesture of goodwill.

39:25.167 --> 39:28.208
That would remove the need
for observers from Earth.

39:28.292 --> 39:29.792
Wouldn't you agree, captain?

39:29.875 --> 39:31.583
[chuckles]

39:31.667 --> 39:33.750
Under those conditions, yes.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.708
I'm sure
your gesture of goodwill

39:36.792 --> 39:40.417
will be appreciated
for what it is, ambassador.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.042
Ambassador G'Kar?

39:45.625 --> 39:46.958
[sighs]
Before coming here

39:47.042 --> 39:50.167
communique
from my government.

39:51.292 --> 39:52.375
For a hundred years

39:52.458 --> 39:55.167
the Centauri
occupied our world..

39:56.042 --> 39:58.542
...devastated it.

39:58.625 --> 40:02.292
We swore we would
never let that happen again.

40:02.375 --> 40:04.958
This attack
on our largest civilian colony

40:05.042 --> 40:09.667
has inflicted terrible damage
and loss of life.

40:09.750 --> 40:13.000
They've crossed a line
we cannot allow them to cross.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.792
As a result, two hours ago

40:16.875 --> 40:20.000
my government
officially declared war

40:20.083 --> 40:22.500
against the Centauri Republic.

40:23.417 --> 40:25.542
Our hope for peace is over.

40:26.875 --> 40:28.917
We are now at war.

40:30.083 --> 40:32.125
We are now at war.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.917
[dramatic music]

40:43.750 --> 40:46.083
And the unfortunate death
of the prime minister

40:46.167 --> 40:48.000
so soon after the emperor

40:48.083 --> 40:51.333
has had the effective tilt in
the balance of power back home.

40:51.417 --> 40:54.333
Several competing families
have been neutralized

40:54.417 --> 40:58.083
leaving the emperor's nephew
to claim the throne

40:58.167 --> 41:01.208
a young man who feels as we do
about the future.

41:15.417 --> 41:18.875
For the first time
in a hundred years, ambassador

41:18.958 --> 41:21.917
our people
are on the right track again.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.042
And we have you
to thank for it.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.333
You will find
the new emperor's gratitude

41:26.417 --> 41:28.458
most rewarding.

41:28.542 --> 41:31.208
- Good day, Mollari.
- Good day, Refa.

41:36.417 --> 41:37.750
(Vir)
'I'm surprised.'

41:37.833 --> 41:40.625
You could have asked
to be named to the Royal Court.

41:40.708 --> 41:42.000
It would have put you
in a position

41:42.083 --> 41:45.083
to become emperor
yourself someday.

41:45.167 --> 41:47.333
That's what you want, isn't it?

41:51.667 --> 41:52.750
[grunting]

41:52.833 --> 41:55.833
[groaning]

41:58.542 --> 42:01.417
No, I have no desire
to be emperor.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.708
No, I prefer to work

42:03.792 --> 42:05.417
behind the scenes.

42:06.333 --> 42:09.125
The reward is nearly as great..

42:09.208 --> 42:11.958
...and the risk far, far less.

42:12.042 --> 42:14.917
(Garibaldi)
So I wanna thank you again
for you help.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.708
You may have saved the lives
of a quarter million Narns.

42:17.792 --> 42:20.750
So then you will give us
the cooperation we need?

42:20.833 --> 42:22.417
On one condition.

42:22.500 --> 42:23.792
I want you to keep me informed

42:23.875 --> 42:26.083
as to what you and the other
rangers hear out there.

42:26.167 --> 42:27.542
We've got a shooting war
on our hands

42:27.625 --> 42:29.875
so we can use
all the information we can get.

42:29.958 --> 42:31.125
Consider it done

42:31.208 --> 42:33.292
as long as you keep
our presence here a secret.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.208
You got a deal.

42:35.292 --> 42:38.542
Oh. One last thing.

42:38.625 --> 42:41.125
Aside from me, does anybody else
know you're here?

42:41.208 --> 42:42.750
Just one other.

42:53.958 --> 42:55.958
(male #2)
'Hello, old friend.'

43:05.000 --> 43:07.417
