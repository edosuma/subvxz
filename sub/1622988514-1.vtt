WEBVTT

00:59.031 --> 00:59.699
Anna!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.902
Anna, Anna can you hear me?

01:01.935 --> 01:04.237
Anna? Give her a little space
girls.

01:04.270 --> 01:05.272
- Anna!
- Anna.

01:05.772 --> 01:06.440
Anna.

01:06.472 --> 01:08.075
Anna! Anna.

01:08.108 --> 01:09.576
She's breathing,

01:09.608 --> 01:12.178
she's just unconscious.
Nurse can I get a 911

01:12.212 --> 01:14.781
call, please? We need
to get her to a hospital.

01:16.950 --> 01:19.920
Help is on the way, they're
coming really soon.

02:26.652 --> 02:27.520
There you go.

02:27.554 --> 02:28.722
- Thank you
- Have a great day.

02:28.754 --> 02:29.455
You too.

02:29.489 --> 02:30.623
I can help who's next.

02:30.657 --> 02:31.725
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

02:31.758 --> 02:33.193
- Good, how are you doing?
- Good.

02:33.225 --> 02:34.760
Good, I need to make a deposit,
please.

02:34.794 --> 02:35.796
Ok! I'd be happy

02:35.829 --> 02:36.796
to help you with that.

02:36.830 --> 02:37.931
Thank you.

02:43.802 --> 02:46.639
I'm gonna need all of that in
large bills.

02:52.078 --> 02:53.413
What's going on with this guy?

02:53.445 --> 02:54.580
I don't know,

02:54.614 --> 02:55.682
don't get involved.

02:55.949 --> 02:57.651
Everybody on the ground!

02:57.683 --> 02:59.985
Oh my God, oh my God no!

03:00.019 --> 03:01.153
Oh my God, please, please!

03:01.187 --> 03:02.722
Roll the bag! Think you're

03:02.754 --> 03:04.191
safe back there but she's not.

03:04.456 --> 03:05.558
She's not safe.

03:05.592 --> 03:07.060
Don't hurt her please!

03:07.092 --> 03:08.094
Hurry up!

03:08.594 --> 03:10.530
Hey, maybe this will speed you
up a little bit.

03:10.562 --> 03:12.164
Wait, wait, do what he says!

03:12.198 --> 03:13.200
No, no please.

03:13.233 --> 03:14.100
Just do what he says!

03:14.133 --> 03:14.767
Alright.

03:15.602 --> 03:16.603
No!

03:18.371 --> 03:19.439
Anna.

03:21.875 --> 03:22.876
Anna!

03:23.408 --> 03:24.411
Are you ok?

03:24.776 --> 03:26.879
I just dreamt that a lady was
murdered.

03:26.913 --> 03:27.881
Oh, honey.

03:27.913 --> 03:29.115
It was so real.

03:29.449 --> 03:32.052
Honey... that's awful.

03:37.623 --> 03:38.792
It was the worst.

03:38.824 --> 03:41.260
It's just another one of your
bad dreams, ok?

03:42.228 --> 03:46.800
Alright, honey? You just need to
go back to sleep... ok?

03:47.266 --> 03:48.401
Alright.

03:50.336 --> 03:52.038
You're gonna be ok.

03:52.070 --> 03:53.507
I heard screaming.

03:55.175 --> 03:57.277
Anna just had
another one of her bad

03:57.310 --> 03:59.445
dreams, it's gonna be ok.
Alright?

03:59.479 --> 04:00.848
Let's get back to bed.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.048
I'm sorry.

04:05.117 --> 04:06.752
Just try to, try to relax...

04:08.086 --> 04:09.889
and have happy dreams.

04:09.923 --> 04:10.924
Ok?

04:12.391 --> 04:14.093
It's ok baby, come on.

04:55.168 --> 04:56.069
Hey, Brody, try

04:56.101 --> 04:56.936
the heart for this?

04:56.970 --> 04:57.938
Yea.

04:57.971 --> 04:59.105
- Hey, give it back, please.

04:59.137 --> 05:00.072
Just do it.

05:00.105 --> 05:00.774
Dude...

05:00.807 --> 05:01.708
Ha ha, I got your phone.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.075
Just give it back, stop.

05:03.108 --> 05:03.909
You want it?

05:03.942 --> 05:05.044
Oh you can't get it, what...

05:05.077 --> 05:06.178
Leave him alone you jerks!

05:06.211 --> 05:07.346
Woo.

05:07.379 --> 05:09.249
He needs a little
girl to save him.

05:09.281 --> 05:11.250
Told you guys he
was a scaredy cat.

05:11.283 --> 05:12.286
I guess you're right.

05:12.552 --> 05:14.588
Well come on, Anna, help him.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.088
He needs you.

05:16.422 --> 05:17.958
Really? Get a life.

05:19.024 --> 05:21.894
Come on, we were just messing
with him. Relax.

05:25.264 --> 05:27.700
Now I saved your life, so are we
finally even?

05:28.701 --> 05:30.804
Everyone take your seats please.

05:31.870 --> 05:34.873
Alright, alright, now I know
there's just a few days of

05:34.906 --> 05:38.377
class left until summer vacation
but we have to stay focused.

05:39.045 --> 05:40.614
We have exams today.

05:43.449 --> 05:44.451
Anna Miller?

05:45.584 --> 05:48.822
Please find your seat and stop
distracting Mr. Mason.

05:51.456 --> 05:53.627
Alright y'all, let's get
started.

05:57.764 --> 06:00.167
Hey, thanks for being a great
friend.

06:00.899 --> 06:03.068
It's not like I've had
much of a choice. Your

06:03.101 --> 06:05.938
locker's been next to mine
since when... first grade?

06:06.406 --> 06:07.441
Second grade.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.041
Whatever.

06:09.274 --> 06:11.210
Don't you remember,
I didn't even live here

06:11.244 --> 06:13.180
in first grade.
I still lived in Northville.

06:23.588 --> 06:24.591
Who are you?

06:25.557 --> 06:26.593
Where's Courtney?

06:28.026 --> 06:29.195
Where are you from?

06:29.728 --> 06:30.730
What's your name?

06:31.297 --> 06:33.300
You don't pick your nose, do
you?

06:35.901 --> 06:37.202
I guess you were better than

06:37.235 --> 06:38.771
Courtney Mabel
the nose picker...

06:39.805 --> 06:41.040
but you were just so quiet.

06:41.074 --> 06:42.643
Well you wouldn't shut up.

06:43.276 --> 06:45.245
You know never mind,
I think I liked

06:45.278 --> 06:47.213
you better when you were quiet.

06:47.245 --> 06:48.414
I'm kidding.

06:48.447 --> 06:50.250
No, I know... but I'm not.

06:51.584 --> 06:53.185
I saved your life
that winter and

06:53.218 --> 06:54.788
this is the thanks
I get from you?

06:55.288 --> 06:56.956
You can't use that for
everything.

06:57.990 --> 06:59.459
I thought we were even.

06:59.492 --> 07:00.494
Nope.

07:00.927 --> 07:02.495
Well maybe you
should have just let

07:02.528 --> 07:04.164
me drown and
freeze to death then.

07:04.197 --> 07:05.564
Maybe next time I will.

07:09.168 --> 07:11.838
So I'm free after school, do you
wanna hangout?

07:12.904 --> 07:13.906
Ok.

07:15.141 --> 07:17.511
Let me just drop off my stuff
and we'll go to your house.

07:18.911 --> 07:21.081
Hoo hoo hoo, look at you.

07:25.117 --> 07:25.786
Ohh.

07:25.819 --> 07:27.287
Alright, seriously?

07:27.786 --> 07:29.789
Get outta here, you guys are
such losers.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.026
That hurts.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.028
That hurts.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.730
Losers? C'mon guys, let's go.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.132
I'm sure Josh needs to go find
his mommy.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.274
Why do you have

07:49.307 --> 07:50.409
to live on a mountain?

07:55.747 --> 07:57.084
Just wait one second.

08:11.230 --> 08:11.865
Hey mom.

08:12.098 --> 08:12.966
Oh hi, honey.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.334
Hi, I'm gonna hangout with Josh.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.169
I'll probably just eat
dinner at his house.

08:16.536 --> 08:18.237
Actually,
as soon as your dad gets

08:18.271 --> 08:20.038
home we're going out for a date

08:20.072 --> 08:21.673
night, so I need you to watch

08:21.706 --> 08:23.709
Emma and Jack
and put them to bed.

08:23.742 --> 08:24.843
Ok?

08:24.877 --> 08:26.713
Wait... that's not fair.
Why do I have

08:26.745 --> 08:28.615
to watch them,
I already have plans.

08:29.081 --> 08:30.650
Honey, I'm sorry that you

08:30.682 --> 08:32.685
already have plans,
but your dad got a promotion

08:32.718 --> 08:34.721
and we haven't been
out in a really long time.

08:36.889 --> 08:38.358
I won't be late, ok?

08:38.857 --> 08:40.760
And you can spend all weekend
with Josh.

08:41.626 --> 08:42.762
Emma, no!

08:43.462 --> 08:44.463
What?

08:46.798 --> 08:49.135
Don't ever play with these,
these are not a toy.

08:50.135 --> 08:51.603
Keep these matches
somewhere she can't

08:51.636 --> 08:53.105
get them,
she could really get hurt.

08:53.139 --> 08:54.874
It's not like she know
how to use them, she

08:54.907 --> 08:56.509
probably couldn't
light one if she tried.

08:56.542 --> 08:57.543
So what?

08:58.043 --> 08:59.645
Oh no, no, he's right. Emma...

09:01.647 --> 09:04.151
These could really hurt you,
they're not a toy. Ok?

09:05.418 --> 09:06.419
Ok?

09:08.553 --> 09:09.221
Oh hey.

09:09.254 --> 09:10.155
Like to go celebrate?

09:10.188 --> 09:11.690
Yes. Alright put these in a safe

09:11.724 --> 09:14.561
place, take care of Emma. I love
you.

09:15.327 --> 09:16.829
I'm gonna go get ready, ok.

09:16.863 --> 09:17.864
Ok.

09:55.868 --> 09:57.871
They are all asleep.

10:03.408 --> 10:05.611
That was a great night, I really
needed that.

10:08.047 --> 10:09.382
The best is yet to come.

10:11.750 --> 10:12.751
Wow...

10:15.488 --> 10:17.857
I've been saving this bottle

10:17.889 --> 10:20.593
for the perfect occasion.
Open it up?

10:21.626 --> 10:23.362
Sounds good to me.

10:23.395 --> 10:27.433
Ohh, hey. Look at what I just
did there.

10:31.003 --> 10:32.405
Remember the last time...

10:33.773 --> 10:35.774
when I ended up wearing most of
the wine?

10:37.909 --> 10:38.911
Oh yea?

10:39.946 --> 10:41.314
Is that how you remember it?

10:41.346 --> 10:44.451
Yes, because that's exactly what
happened.

10:48.287 --> 10:49.288
Oh.

10:51.957 --> 10:53.626
I think it's your turn this
time.

10:57.263 --> 10:59.199
Hold that thought, I will be
right back.

11:05.870 --> 11:08.307
Yes, I'd appreciate that, thank
you.

11:09.575 --> 11:10.576
Yea, I'll hold.

11:16.749 --> 11:18.850
I'm going to Josh's, I'll be
back later.

11:18.884 --> 11:20.586
Oh, you want some breakfast?

11:20.620 --> 11:21.620
I'm not hungry.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.201
Hey.

11:35.234 --> 11:37.103
Hey, so what do you wanna do?

11:37.403 --> 11:38.236
You wanna go

11:38.269 --> 11:39.271
hangout at the pond?

11:40.105 --> 11:41.106
Sure.

12:06.932 --> 12:08.902
Somebody! Help!

12:13.072 --> 12:14.740
Anna! Grab my hand.

12:18.309 --> 12:20.312
This place still creeps me out
sometimes.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.821
I'm sorry about last night. I
know you wanted to hangout.

12:29.087 --> 12:30.723
My parents are so unfair.

12:32.258 --> 12:34.927
I shouldn't have to babysit when
I already have plans.

12:35.226 --> 12:36.895
You should be
grateful that you have

12:36.928 --> 12:38.497
a brother and sister to babysit.

12:38.964 --> 12:41.668
You're an only child, so you
don't know what it's like.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.471
I'll take them over being alone
any day.

12:45.804 --> 12:46.805
I guess.

12:47.605 --> 12:48.807
Hey, I have an idea.

12:49.341 --> 12:51.010
Maybe it'll help cheer you up.

12:51.409 --> 12:52.411
What?

12:53.511 --> 12:55.280
Ok, we need to find something
sharp.

12:56.448 --> 12:57.449
Will this do?

12:58.683 --> 12:59.885
Where did you get that?

12:59.918 --> 13:01.721
I just have it in case I might
need it.

13:02.087 --> 13:03.756
For what, murdering someone?

13:04.289 --> 13:06.425
Maybe, if someone ever hurt you.

13:08.360 --> 13:11.096
I don't know if I should take
that as a compliment or...

13:11.363 --> 13:13.867
It means that I'll never let
anything happen to you.

13:14.734 --> 13:16.335
How many times have I saved your
life?

13:16.368 --> 13:18.538
Oh yea, yea, I know,
I owe you big

13:18.571 --> 13:20.740
time because you saved me life.

13:21.474 --> 13:24.411
You just like the fact that I
owe you something, don't you?

13:25.711 --> 13:27.480
You know I'm gonna make it up to
you.

13:27.980 --> 13:29.682
Well you should be more careful,
you

13:29.715 --> 13:31.384
can't make it up to
me if you're dead.

13:32.884 --> 13:35.587
I could be your
guardian angel... no I

13:35.620 --> 13:38.423
could watch over you
and keep you safe.

13:38.456 --> 13:39.692
No, no way.

13:39.725 --> 13:40.726
Yea.

13:40.759 --> 13:42.427
You have to think
of a way to make it

13:42.461 --> 13:44.431
up to me that doesn't
involve you dying.

13:46.264 --> 13:47.266
Anyways.

13:48.368 --> 13:50.802
Do you think your knife can
carve into these rocks?

13:50.836 --> 13:53.005
Maybe. What are we carving?

13:54.506 --> 13:57.275
Maybe... our initials?

13:57.308 --> 13:58.310
What for?

13:59.577 --> 14:01.714
Just to have something to keep
and remember our friendship by.

14:02.514 --> 14:04.350
You know, I keep yours, you keep
mine.

14:05.384 --> 14:06.318
Is that stupid?

14:06.351 --> 14:08.187
No, no, it could be cool. Here,
give me one.

14:10.855 --> 14:12.024
What are your initials?

14:12.057 --> 14:12.825
You don't know?

14:12.857 --> 14:13.859
Wait...

14:14.125 --> 14:16.395
Anna Renee Miller... A. R. M.

14:17.897 --> 14:18.698
Arm.

14:18.730 --> 14:19.865
What's yours?

14:19.899 --> 14:21.366
You mean you don't know?

14:22.067 --> 14:23.068
Hmm...

14:24.035 --> 14:26.105
I know it's J...

14:26.371 --> 14:27.205
Fail!

14:27.240 --> 14:29.108
Alright, you didn't even let me
finish.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.543
Ok, a real best friend wouldn't
have to think that long.

14:31.576 --> 14:32.578
Shut up...

14:33.144 --> 14:34.146
it's Joshua...

14:35.380 --> 14:36.381
Edward...

14:37.048 --> 14:38.050
Mason.

14:38.783 --> 14:39.619
J. E. M.

14:39.652 --> 14:40.953
Cause I'm a real gem.

14:40.985 --> 14:42.554
That's not even how you spell
gem.

14:42.587 --> 14:44.256
Well it's still better than ARM.

14:47.725 --> 14:50.862
We both have a last name
that starts with M, so we could

14:50.895 --> 14:54.000
use M and we could use
the J for Josh and A for Anna.

14:54.933 --> 14:56.001
J. A. M.

14:56.936 --> 14:57.937
Jam.

14:58.571 --> 14:59.572
Yea.

15:00.004 --> 15:01.607
That's actually pretty cool.

15:02.541 --> 15:05.011
See, I told you this would make
you feel better.

15:05.043 --> 15:05.711
Thanks.

15:06.010 --> 15:07.045
I do feel better.

15:07.947 --> 15:08.947
Yea.

15:09.215 --> 15:10.216
Now get carving.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.211
Alright, which one do you want?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.581
- This one.
- No, I want that one.

15:51.956 --> 15:52.958
Hey.

15:53.926 --> 15:55.961
A 53 year old woman
now identified as,

15:55.995 --> 15:58.597
Sharon West,
was shot and killed in a robbery

15:58.630 --> 16:00.732
at this location earlier today.
Police

16:00.765 --> 16:03.401
have one suspect in custody,
that suspect...

16:03.434 --> 16:04.436
Anna.

16:05.203 --> 16:06.438
Do it, right!

16:08.606 --> 16:09.841
What's wrong, honey?

16:09.875 --> 16:11.309
ten thousand dollars.

16:11.342 --> 16:13.211
Police are confirming one thing,
one

16:13.245 --> 16:15.648
victim is dead as a
result of this robbery.

16:15.681 --> 16:16.682
That poor woman.

16:18.216 --> 16:20.419
She was in the wrong place at
the wrong time.

16:21.287 --> 16:22.788
Happened a few hours ago.

16:27.225 --> 16:28.760
The woman in your dream...

16:29.727 --> 16:31.597
She doesn't look like
the woman on TV.

16:32.298 --> 16:33.533
I'm not mistaken.

16:35.301 --> 16:37.370
Please don't look at me like I'm
crazy.

16:37.403 --> 16:38.403
I'm not.

16:39.504 --> 16:42.375
I'm telling you everything that
I saw on the news...

16:42.707 --> 16:45.110
the people... the bank.

16:46.144 --> 16:48.447
It's exactly like what was in my
dream.

16:49.881 --> 16:50.883
It's like...

16:51.283 --> 16:53.418
they took it out of my head or

16:53.818 --> 16:55.587
I dreamt it before it happened.

16:56.054 --> 16:57.355
Honey, don't say that

16:57.389 --> 16:58.924
it's not possible, ok?

16:59.958 --> 17:02.728
Look, why don't you take a
shower...

17:03.495 --> 17:05.397
go down stairs, have some food.

17:05.897 --> 17:07.500
I know you're gonna feel better.

17:07.532 --> 17:08.533
I promise.

17:09.768 --> 17:12.404
Look, I can't just forget about
this like it didn't happen.

17:13.372 --> 17:15.074
I know that's what
you want me to do

17:15.106 --> 17:17.874
because you can't
think of an answer.

17:18.210 --> 17:19.778
I'm not crazy.

17:21.913 --> 17:24.349
Go away, you're obviously not
gonna believe me.

17:24.383 --> 17:27.519
It's not that I don't believe
you honey, it's just...

17:29.253 --> 17:30.255
I think that...

17:32.290 --> 17:33.393
what you dreamt...

17:35.193 --> 17:36.194
is just...

17:37.528 --> 17:38.564
it's just similar...

17:39.765 --> 17:42.735
it... it's just playing tricks
on your mind, that's all.

17:45.104 --> 17:47.340
Look, there's nothing we can do.

17:47.373 --> 17:50.442
Bank robberies happen
and people get killed.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.214
But your dream...

17:57.148 --> 17:58.150
honey...

17:58.416 --> 17:59.418
your dream...

18:02.054 --> 18:03.855
was really just a dream.

18:04.490 --> 18:06.326
No, this one's different.

18:07.326 --> 18:10.129
Sharon West, no,
she was the woman in

18:10.162 --> 18:12.932
my dream,
she was the exact same woman

18:13.499 --> 18:14.701
and she's real, mom!

18:16.367 --> 18:18.104
And now she's really dead.

18:22.708 --> 18:25.611
Just go away if you're not gonna
believe me.

18:37.021 --> 18:38.523
Ok, I'll leave you alone.

19:28.039 --> 19:30.675
I had a feeling I'd
find you up here.

19:30.709 --> 19:33.346
Go home and get
yourself some rest.

19:36.248 --> 19:38.683
Says here they're giving us an
additional 90 days.

19:40.118 --> 19:42.754
You're essentially forced to cut
all research funding.

19:42.788 --> 19:43.789
What?

19:45.190 --> 19:47.192
Continue all
facility operations as

19:47.226 --> 19:49.629
normal and not a
word of this to anyone.

19:50.695 --> 19:51.529
Of course.

19:51.564 --> 19:53.533
We just take whatever we can get
for now.

19:56.234 --> 19:58.503
Sorry to interrupt,
there's a new patient inquiry

19:58.537 --> 20:00.573
and I think you need
to take a look at it.

20:01.772 --> 20:02.774
Sure.

20:03.407 --> 20:05.377
I gotta find myself
a new spot to think.

20:09.413 --> 20:11.416
Are you sure we're doing the
right thing?

20:11.817 --> 20:12.818
I mean really?

20:14.786 --> 20:17.590
Maybe we should just
wait a little bit longer

20:17.623 --> 20:20.826
until she gets better before
we take her anywhere.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.397
She's had vivid dreams since
the incident at summer softball.

20:27.499 --> 20:29.102
She's had trouble telling what's
real

20:29.500 --> 20:31.170
and it's only getting worse.

20:31.970 --> 20:35.074
It's almost been 6... years.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.577
But, she's gonna feel like we've
betrayed her.

20:39.478 --> 20:41.180
And, what if she doesn't wanna
go?

20:42.413 --> 20:43.950
She doesn't have a choice.

20:44.316 --> 20:46.451
She's not stable enough
to choose, we have to

20:46.484 --> 20:48.620
make the decision
about what's best for her.

20:49.188 --> 20:50.189
Look...

20:50.689 --> 20:52.024
she's very confused.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.862
She doesn't realize that she
needs help but...

20:56.428 --> 20:58.131
they'll know how to help her
there.

20:58.630 --> 21:01.234
I mean we've already tried
everything else.

21:03.902 --> 21:05.571
Maybe we just keep her there.

21:06.371 --> 21:08.541
You know, just until they
find...

21:09.540 --> 21:12.110
a proper diagnosis, because I
can't...

21:16.781 --> 21:18.483
I can't stand the thought...

21:19.785 --> 21:22.555
of leaving her there long term.

21:23.055 --> 21:24.056
Just can't.

21:24.923 --> 21:25.723
Come here.

21:25.757 --> 21:26.926
I can't

21:26.959 --> 21:27.960
It'll be ok.

21:29.094 --> 21:30.096
I promise.

21:40.939 --> 21:42.675
Josh, get in here, it's pouring
out.

21:43.808 --> 21:45.944
Yea, I know,
just hoping to see Anna.

21:46.310 --> 21:47.312
Well...

21:49.647 --> 21:51.583
she's still not coming out of
her room.

21:53.117 --> 21:55.486
Well, would it be ok if I go up
and talk to her?

21:55.519 --> 21:58.223
You know I think it would do her
some good to see you.

21:58.257 --> 22:00.993
You can give it a shot, what's
the worst that can happen?

22:01.026 --> 22:02.695
Just throws you out her window?

22:14.038 --> 22:15.708
People are worried about you
Anna.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.211
I'm worried about you.

22:20.211 --> 22:21.881
I just want my best friend back.

22:23.481 --> 22:24.884
Do you even believe me?

22:25.416 --> 22:27.086
Are you just like everyone else?

22:29.421 --> 22:30.456
I'm not crazy.

22:30.489 --> 22:31.490
No, I know...

22:32.324 --> 22:33.759
of course I believe you.

22:34.058 --> 22:37.997
I think they wanna send me to
some kind of mental hospital.

22:38.829 --> 22:40.566
Maybe they can help you get
better?

22:41.967 --> 22:44.303
I don't need to get better
because I'm not sick.

22:44.736 --> 22:46.071
Did they tell you to say that?

22:46.104 --> 22:49.307
No, no! That's not what I meant.
I'm sorry.

22:50.608 --> 22:52.778
What I meant is they
can help you deal with

22:52.810 --> 22:54.846
what happened,
so that you feel better.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.086
I don't know what to do.

23:01.752 --> 23:02.754
I feel so alone.

23:05.057 --> 23:06.592
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

23:10.729 --> 23:14.267
You know one horrible thing can
change your life forever...

23:15.800 --> 23:17.535
even ruin your life, if you let
it.

23:19.770 --> 23:21.473
You know you can't change the
past.

23:24.241 --> 23:25.911
I'd give anything to go back.

23:28.980 --> 23:30.383
I wanna play too.

23:31.883 --> 23:34.252
Now don't come out no matter

23:34.286 --> 23:38.490
what until someone finds you.
Stay here and be very quiet.

23:38.990 --> 23:39.991
Ok, I won't.

23:48.333 --> 23:49.335
Help!

23:51.103 --> 23:51.737
Help!

23:58.143 --> 23:59.778
Josh, where is your sister?

24:00.778 --> 24:01.713
Oh God!

24:05.416 --> 24:07.318
Maggie! She's still in there.

24:07.352 --> 24:09.288
I'll go get her. Keep the boys
out of here.

24:13.724 --> 24:15.627
Maggie... Maggie!

24:19.564 --> 24:21.267
I panicked and I forgot about
her.

24:22.733 --> 24:24.436
No one else knew where she was.

24:25.737 --> 24:27.105
She died because of me.

24:28.606 --> 24:29.642
That's so awful.

24:30.808 --> 24:31.810
I'm so sorry.

24:33.545 --> 24:35.147
How come you never told me?

24:36.882 --> 24:38.584
I never even knew you had a
sister.

24:38.884 --> 24:40.553
I don't like to talk about it.

24:41.987 --> 24:43.589
I tried so hard to forget.

24:45.891 --> 24:48.961
That was the summer after first
grade. We were gonna rebuild

24:48.993 --> 24:50.695
but...
my mom couldn't stand being

24:50.729 --> 24:52.431
in that house after Maggie died.

24:53.265 --> 24:54.667
That's why I moved here.

24:56.101 --> 24:57.770
It's only 15 minutes away but...

24:58.936 --> 25:00.638
it got us out of Northville.

25:01.740 --> 25:02.740
Wait...

25:03.842 --> 25:06.178
did you live across the street
from Willow Park?

25:07.445 --> 25:08.547
Josh...

25:09.448 --> 25:10.449
I was there!

25:11.549 --> 25:13.251
I was at the park when it
happened.

25:14.452 --> 25:16.387
My babysitter used
to live in Northville,

25:16.421 --> 25:18.124
she used to take
me to Willow Park.

25:19.089 --> 25:20.091
I was swinging.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.129
Everything was fine...

25:25.262 --> 25:26.264
but then...

25:32.971 --> 25:35.039
I'm sorry, we don't have to talk
about it.

25:36.407 --> 25:39.077
I just can't believe I never
knew that was your house.

25:39.544 --> 25:42.214
I always wondered what happened
after we left that day.

25:44.715 --> 25:46.751
They told me the firemen got
everyone out.

25:47.818 --> 25:50.588
I guess they didn't want me to
know about your sister.

25:51.088 --> 25:53.458
Well I miss her, so much...

25:54.992 --> 25:56.561
and that'll never go away...

25:58.430 --> 26:00.633
but I went to therapy and it
helped me a lot.

26:04.269 --> 26:06.038
Promise me you'll let them help
you...

26:07.705 --> 26:10.942
and, you won't be alone, I'll
come visit you.

26:13.744 --> 26:18.216
Yea, maybe you're right. If you
think it'll help I'll go.

26:36.101 --> 26:37.102
Mrs. Miller, hi.

26:38.470 --> 26:41.273
I'm Dr. Jenkins. It's nice to
finally meet you in person.

26:41.940 --> 26:44.009
Anna,
hopefully you'll like it here.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.044
We've got a lot
of fun things to do.

26:46.478 --> 26:49.515
In fact in about 15 minutes we
have a dodge ball tournament in

26:49.548 --> 26:50.949
the gym, if that sounds like

26:50.981 --> 26:52.817
something that
would be fun for you.

26:53.084 --> 26:55.153
You can meet some of the other
patients and...

26:58.589 --> 27:00.558
Yea? Great, please follow me.

27:10.701 --> 27:12.570
We could always
use some fresh fruit on

27:12.604 --> 27:14.507
the team,
are you any good at dodge ball?

27:20.412 --> 27:22.814
We're just practicing
right now but I'm telling

27:22.846 --> 27:25.183
you, it's gonna be the
game of the century.

27:26.884 --> 27:29.922
Go... fight... win...

27:29.954 --> 27:32.390
That's Peanut and Noodle,
they're our cheerleaders.

27:32.856 --> 27:34.660
I give all the girls
food nicknames.

27:34.692 --> 27:36.761
You look like you'd
make a good muffin.

27:37.461 --> 27:38.463
Muffin?

27:38.863 --> 27:39.765
You could make a

27:39.798 --> 27:40.865
good cheerleader Muffin,

27:40.898 --> 27:42.634
but for now we need
you on our team.

27:44.368 --> 27:47.038
Oh, that's Marshmallow, she's
very sensitive.

27:47.372 --> 27:49.041
Just be careful what you say.

27:49.874 --> 27:51.943
Hey Marshmallow, your shirts on
backwards.

27:56.714 --> 27:57.949
Heads up!

28:02.354 --> 28:05.157
Ok, Anna, so in order for
us to get accurate readings

28:05.190 --> 28:08.027
you just have to try and
relax as much as possible. Ok?

28:08.859 --> 28:09.527
Ok.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.928
Alright.

28:10.961 --> 28:13.164
So now we're gonna put you
into an induced sleep so that

28:13.198 --> 28:15.834
we can compare the results
with your daytime activity.

28:16.835 --> 28:18.403
Hopefully we can
determine what's

28:18.435 --> 28:20.071
going on in these
dreams of yours.

28:21.405 --> 28:23.474
Don't be afraid, this won't hurt

28:23.508 --> 28:25.577
at all. You won't feel...
anything.

28:26.176 --> 28:28.379
In a few minutes you are gonna

28:28.413 --> 28:30.682
start to feel very,
very, sleepy.

28:38.423 --> 28:39.424
How you doing?

28:40.858 --> 28:41.859
Ok.

28:43.795 --> 28:45.029
I'll be right there.

29:34.612 --> 29:35.846
- Hey.
- Hey!

29:35.880 --> 29:38.684
How's your wife, did they find
the match yet?

29:38.717 --> 29:39.951
No, no, no match yet.

29:40.785 --> 29:43.355
The two we thought might work
out cam back negative but...

29:44.255 --> 29:46.158
she's hanging in there. She's
doing alright.

29:46.191 --> 29:47.459
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:47.858 --> 29:49.360
Well, go and take

29:49.394 --> 29:52.329
care of her and enjoy
your night off. Ok?

29:52.363 --> 29:53.365
Thank you.

30:14.051 --> 30:16.888
Honey, don't worry about him.
He's harmless.

30:33.171 --> 30:34.173
May I cut in?

30:34.806 --> 30:36.641
C'mon Jive, we've talked about

30:36.673 --> 30:39.110
this before... boundaries.

30:51.256 --> 30:52.291
So how you doing?

30:53.458 --> 30:55.194
I wish you would get me out of
here.

30:55.626 --> 30:58.430
Maybe if you try to make some
friends you'll start liking it.

30:58.462 --> 31:00.432
All he people here
are crazy and I

31:00.464 --> 31:02.734
don't think I need
more crazy friends.

31:02.967 --> 31:05.871
Well maybe you can try to find
the least crazy of the crazy.

31:07.471 --> 31:09.141
I just hope I can go home soon.

31:14.878 --> 31:16.048
Do you see that guy?

31:20.417 --> 31:21.652
The janitor?

31:21.685 --> 31:25.557
Yea, like every time I see him I
feel like he's watching me...

31:26.423 --> 31:28.626
but I can't help but to stare
back.

31:29.928 --> 31:30.929
It's weird.

31:32.063 --> 31:35.100
I get his vibe like I know him
from somewhere but...

31:36.067 --> 31:37.803
I've never even talked to him
before.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.643
Can I have your pickle?

31:45.175 --> 31:46.177
You can have it.

31:48.512 --> 31:50.048
I came all the way out here, the

31:50.080 --> 31:51.817
least you can do
is give me a pickle.

32:05.195 --> 32:06.964
You need to leave, you're in the
way.

32:11.201 --> 32:14.405
Ok, welcome to group
therapy everyone. This is Anna's

32:14.439 --> 32:17.442
first time here so let's
make her feel welcome.

32:17.741 --> 32:20.645
Anna, would you like to tell us
a little bit about yourself?

32:24.449 --> 32:26.919
Alright, maybe it would
help Anna if someone else...

32:27.885 --> 32:28.953
decided to go first?

32:29.287 --> 32:29.922
Anyone.

32:30.954 --> 32:31.722
Cassie.

32:31.756 --> 32:33.959
My name is Cassie,
I'm 16, I love

32:33.991 --> 32:36.861
frogs, grass,
limes and green beans.

32:36.894 --> 32:38.797
I basically love everything
that's green.

32:39.396 --> 32:42.934
One time I vowed to only eat
green stuff for a whole year.

32:43.268 --> 32:44.736
Nobody thought I could do it
though.

32:44.769 --> 32:47.605
That's great, Cassie,
thank you so much. See we can

32:47.638 --> 32:50.908
share anything we want to
in this room, anything at all.

32:52.609 --> 32:53.611
I'm 14...

32:54.746 --> 32:57.082
I've been having these dreams
ever since I was 8...

32:57.615 --> 32:59.483
and now they're starting to come
true.

33:01.885 --> 33:04.522
See, Anna's having trouble
telling...

33:05.088 --> 33:07.358
her dreams from reality.

33:08.292 --> 33:10.227
So does anybody
have any ideas or

33:10.260 --> 33:13.097
suggestions that might
be able to help, Anna.

33:14.198 --> 33:15.868
I wish my dreams would come
true.

33:16.567 --> 33:18.936
Ok, maybe we should
play a game that allows

33:18.970 --> 33:21.273
everybody to sort
of have some input...

33:21.306 --> 33:23.642
Wait... could you dream
something for me?

33:25.042 --> 33:27.778
Ok, you know what? Let's
talk about dreams, let's talk

33:27.811 --> 33:30.581
about dreams, cause dreams
can be very, very, powerful.

33:33.050 --> 33:33.918
Does anybody

33:33.951 --> 33:35.053
know what causes this?

33:40.991 --> 33:42.728
I wish I wasn't afraid to sleep.

33:43.961 --> 33:44.962
I'm so tired.

33:45.663 --> 33:47.665
Alright, it's ok, take a nap.

33:49.099 --> 33:50.601
I'll be right here
and if you look

33:50.634 --> 33:52.170
like you're having
a bad dream...

33:52.936 --> 33:53.971
I'll wake you up.

33:54.838 --> 33:55.840
Really?

33:56.807 --> 33:57.608
Promise?

33:57.642 --> 33:58.644
Yea.

33:59.076 --> 34:00.077
Get some sleep.

34:46.623 --> 34:49.226
Hey, hey, it'll be ok, hey...

34:50.594 --> 34:51.596
it's ok.

35:31.902 --> 35:33.570
Oh you have to excuse my little

35:33.603 --> 35:35.573
friend Tiko here,
he's very curious.

35:36.407 --> 35:38.210
He likes to know everyone's
business.

35:38.809 --> 35:40.244
You mind if we come in?

35:41.311 --> 35:43.847
I'm Lenny,
we've been wanting to meet you

35:43.880 --> 35:46.817
every since you came
here but we're kinda shy

35:47.617 --> 35:49.887
and Tiko likes to spy on all the
new patients,

35:50.922 --> 35:52.590
but don't think we're crazy.

35:53.423 --> 35:54.992
Isn't everyone crazy here.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.563
I mean, it is a mental ward,
isn't it?

35:59.063 --> 36:01.166
Well it depends on your
definition of crazy.

36:02.099 --> 36:05.069
I mean I think we're pretty cool
if you get to know us.

36:05.702 --> 36:06.737
Have you met Jive?

36:07.038 --> 36:09.007
He's the coolest dancer you'll
ever see.

36:09.873 --> 36:11.407
He doesn't stop.

36:11.409 --> 36:13.111
He even dances in his sleep.

36:14.744 --> 36:15.746
Oh yea...

36:16.847 --> 36:19.050
that kid, no, I've seen him
around a few times.

36:20.384 --> 36:21.985
How long's he been dancing?

36:22.018 --> 36:23.287
Ever since...

36:24.588 --> 36:25.590
he came out...

36:26.190 --> 36:27.925
of his mother's womb.

36:31.762 --> 36:34.633
So you look pretty normal, why
are you here?

36:35.532 --> 36:37.235
It's kind of a long story.

36:37.268 --> 36:39.036
I'd rather not talk about it.

36:39.070 --> 36:40.639
Well I bet you're not crazy.

36:41.405 --> 36:43.075
You're too pretty to be crazy.

36:45.108 --> 36:46.344
So does he talk?

36:46.376 --> 36:49.114
Oh yea, you just have to give
him a little time to open up.

36:49.746 --> 36:51.750
He's super shy until he gets to
know you.

36:52.583 --> 36:54.418
He doesn't just trust anyone you
know,

36:55.253 --> 36:57.856
but once he does open up...
it's hard to get

36:57.889 --> 37:00.791
him to shut up, and he'll
be your friend forever,

37:01.826 --> 37:03.894
and then he'll expect
you to go on spy

37:03.927 --> 37:06.697
missions with him whenever
a new patient comes.

37:07.331 --> 37:09.334
It's kind of entertaining,
there's nothing

37:09.367 --> 37:11.369
really else to do
around here you know?

37:12.836 --> 37:15.907
What? It might look
weird that I hangout with a

37:15.940 --> 37:19.077
little kid, but Tiko he's
like my little brother.

37:19.710 --> 37:21.378
Kinda grows on you like a
fungus.

37:22.112 --> 37:24.215
Once he clings on, he's hard to
get rid of.

37:28.753 --> 37:31.690
Wow, looks like he likes you
already.

37:33.456 --> 37:35.359
Ok, boys,
Anna and I have a session

37:35.393 --> 37:37.262
right now,
so if you'll excuse us...

37:37.795 --> 37:38.864
Thank you, Lenny.

37:39.396 --> 37:40.965
Thank you very much, Tiko.

37:41.431 --> 37:43.567
Down you go buddy, off you go.

37:47.304 --> 37:49.606
So when can I go home?
Cause I don't wanna

37:49.639 --> 37:52.076
be here and I don't
belong here anyway.

37:52.108 --> 37:54.612
Well, Anna,
in my professional opinion

37:54.644 --> 37:56.947
you absolutely do...
belong here...

37:57.547 --> 38:00.284
and how long you remain here is
totally up to you.

38:03.019 --> 38:05.222
Anna, the human mind is so...

38:06.190 --> 38:07.592
complex and so difficult...

38:08.525 --> 38:10.694
to understand, and we're
learning new things...

38:11.329 --> 38:12.330
all the time.

38:13.063 --> 38:15.366
Ok, but your mind can play
tricks on you...

38:16.067 --> 38:18.603
and it can make us believe
things that aren't true.

38:19.737 --> 38:21.673
I know what's true and what's
not true.

38:23.273 --> 38:25.543
My dreams aren't make believe.

38:25.909 --> 38:27.744
I'm not stupid and I'm not
crazy.

38:27.777 --> 38:31.682
Anna, nobody thinks that you're
crazy or that you're stupid.

38:33.184 --> 38:35.753
Anna, I know we've spent
the results of your scan

38:35.786 --> 38:38.389
to a doctor who specializes
in this sort of thing.

38:39.090 --> 38:43.061
Ok? He is very interested in
what's going on in your sleep,

38:43.728 --> 38:46.197
but he wants us
to run more tests

38:46.230 --> 38:48.699
when your sleep is not induced.

38:48.965 --> 38:50.634
He wants your sleep to be
natural.

38:50.934 --> 38:53.036
I would like to start
those tests right away,

38:53.070 --> 38:55.440
but you need to get on
a better sleeping pattern.

38:55.873 --> 38:57.976
Is this a bad time? Should I
come back later?

38:58.476 --> 39:01.046
No, no, I'm glad you're here,
please stay.

39:01.311 --> 39:02.980
Alright,
go ahead then and visit.

39:03.014 --> 39:04.649
We can finish our session later.

39:11.755 --> 39:13.424
I'm really happy you're here.

39:13.891 --> 39:15.526
What have the doctors been
saying?

39:15.559 --> 39:17.295
Have you gotten any better by
now?

39:17.327 --> 39:19.630
They keep saying
my mind's tricking me

39:19.664 --> 39:22.000
into thinking things
that aren't true.

39:23.567 --> 39:25.869
They don't believe me,
they think I'm crazy.

39:26.670 --> 39:28.672
Maybe you should just agree with
them.

39:28.706 --> 39:31.009
I mean they'll never let you out
of here if you keep...

39:31.041 --> 39:32.043
Keep what!

39:32.443 --> 39:33.778
What am I doing wrong?

39:34.177 --> 39:35.579
I thought you believed me?

39:35.612 --> 39:37.915
I do, I do believe you, it's
just...

39:38.548 --> 39:40.851
all I'm saying is if you see it
from their view,

39:41.786 --> 39:43.387
they'll let you come home.

39:44.054 --> 39:45.056
But...

39:45.289 --> 39:46.891
no matter what, I'll visit you

39:46.923 --> 39:48.559
no matter how
long they keep you.

39:50.360 --> 39:54.031
So anyway, I saw that guy who
calls you Muffin.

39:55.132 --> 39:56.501
I think he likes you.

39:56.534 --> 39:59.604
He was asking me about you, I
think he's not really your type.

40:00.403 --> 40:01.505
He seems kinda...

40:01.539 --> 40:02.140
Crazy?

40:02.840 --> 40:04.742
Yea, I guess he is your type.

40:05.309 --> 40:06.378
Oh shut up.

40:07.644 --> 40:09.547
You always have to be funny,
don't you?

40:09.980 --> 40:11.248
You know you love it.

40:11.748 --> 40:12.750
Muffin.

41:24.889 --> 41:26.091
I'm... I'm sorry.

41:27.123 --> 41:29.626
I didn't mean to... I'm Anna.

41:30.628 --> 41:32.130
That's a good nickname.

41:32.163 --> 41:34.498
That's my name, it's not a
nickname.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.402
Anushka?

41:38.101 --> 41:38.935
What is that?

41:38.969 --> 41:40.904
Do you know why you were
following me?

41:40.938 --> 41:41.940
What?

41:44.240 --> 41:46.143
I've seen you around and I feel

41:46.177 --> 41:48.113
like I know you
from somewhere...

41:48.846 --> 41:50.914
You don't have to explain your
intuitions.

41:51.315 --> 41:52.317
I'm Takota.

41:52.782 --> 41:54.451
You have a lot to figure out.

41:56.119 --> 41:57.154
What do you mean?

41:57.521 --> 41:59.190
I feel like you know something.

41:59.789 --> 42:01.525
You've been having visions.

42:01.559 --> 42:02.560
Visions?

42:03.092 --> 42:04.728
No, what did they tell you?

42:05.028 --> 42:07.532
I happened to see them when they
were scanning you.

42:08.065 --> 42:10.068
Your dreams aren't ordinary
dreams, Anna,

42:10.534 --> 42:12.470
something I haven't seen in a
long time.

42:14.972 --> 42:17.375
I've been having these dreams
since I was little.

42:18.242 --> 42:19.944
Now, they're starting to come
true.

42:21.644 --> 42:23.148
I dreamed this lady died...

42:23.947 --> 42:24.949
and then...

42:25.648 --> 42:26.650
she did.

42:28.117 --> 42:29.721
Everyone thinks I'm crazy.

42:30.621 --> 42:31.956
How do I make it stop?

42:32.289 --> 42:34.759
This is something you shouldn't
be asking yourself.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.262
You have a gift, Anna.

42:37.494 --> 42:39.797
It's not a gift, it's ruining my
life,

42:40.231 --> 42:41.933
that I'm afraid to go to sleep.

42:42.398 --> 42:43.934
What if someone
else died because

42:43.967 --> 42:45.269
of something that I dream?

42:46.135 --> 42:47.806
My dreams are the whole problem.

42:48.172 --> 42:50.240
Like I said, you have a lot to
figure out.

42:52.175 --> 42:53.610
I don't know what to do.

42:54.277 --> 42:55.946
It's like I'm afraid of myself.

42:56.981 --> 42:59.918
You're not afraid of yourself,
you're afraid of the unknown.

43:00.451 --> 43:02.052
You're afraid of what
you think you can't

43:02.085 --> 43:03.754
control,
what you think you can't change.

43:04.755 --> 43:06.391
Stop running from yourself.

43:06.690 --> 43:08.358
You can't outrun your destiny.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.896
It's so hard when no one
believes me.

43:12.963 --> 43:14.865
Why do you need someone to
believe you?

43:15.632 --> 43:18.135
Your destiny does not require
approval from anyone.

43:18.802 --> 43:21.773
Believe in yourself, Anna, and
you will do great things.

43:26.476 --> 43:27.978
Do you know what this is?

43:28.778 --> 43:30.780
It looks like a butterfly net or
something.

43:30.813 --> 43:32.049
It's a dream catcher.

43:33.317 --> 43:35.052
I've had this a very long time.

43:35.885 --> 43:37.454
I take it everywhere I go.

43:37.755 --> 43:38.756
What's it for?

43:39.155 --> 43:40.458
Some people think it's...

43:41.125 --> 43:43.760
it captures your bad dreams so
that you only have good ones.

43:44.460 --> 43:46.430
That could be the answer to my
problems.

43:46.896 --> 43:48.799
Actually, it doesn't prevent bad
dreams.

43:50.934 --> 43:53.538
The truth is,
for people like you, it only

43:53.570 --> 43:56.139
captures what your
true dreams are made of.

43:57.273 --> 43:59.009
Then, you know your dreams are
safe.

43:59.577 --> 44:00.845
What do you mean safe?

44:01.244 --> 44:03.947
You fear your dreams because you
don't understand them.

44:04.514 --> 44:05.916
You doubt your abilities.

44:06.449 --> 44:08.885
If you catch the dreams
that are your inner

44:08.918 --> 44:11.355
truth, you can use
them to set you free.

44:12.056 --> 44:13.724
You must overcome your fear.

44:14.224 --> 44:15.894
Find strength in your destiny.

44:19.096 --> 44:20.764
Are you finding everything ok?

44:21.130 --> 44:22.232
Yea, I was just...

44:22.699 --> 44:24.868
Dakota, can you come help me
with something?

44:32.409 --> 44:33.778
Honey, you're exhausted.

44:37.246 --> 44:39.849
I should get going, you know, so

44:39.882 --> 44:42.486
you can get some rest,
some sleep.

44:44.420 --> 44:45.422
I doubt it.

44:47.056 --> 44:48.492
It's hard to relax here.

44:49.793 --> 44:51.394
You get to go home to your nice

44:51.427 --> 44:53.263
comfy bed and I'm
stuck here alone.

44:53.998 --> 44:55.934
No, don't say that, you're not.

44:57.967 --> 45:00.170
You're not alone, you never will
be.

45:02.072 --> 45:04.509
I want you to know how much we
love you?

45:06.043 --> 45:07.679
We're all in this together.

45:08.112 --> 45:09.713
This is for your own good.

45:11.014 --> 45:12.616
I'm too tired to talk about
this.

45:14.385 --> 45:15.420
I'm too tired too.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.623
I can't sleep with the thought
of...

45:21.125 --> 45:22.860
you being here, it's killing me.

45:27.364 --> 45:28.733
It's hard on all of us.

45:35.039 --> 45:36.040
Just...

45:36.706 --> 45:38.409
try to get some sleep, ok honey?

45:40.110 --> 45:41.112
I love you.

45:44.782 --> 45:46.484
I'll be back in a couple days.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.489
Oh, Mrs. Miller...

45:52.789 --> 45:53.791
What?

45:54.891 --> 45:56.727
I was just leaving, could I talk
to you for a minute?

45:58.128 --> 45:59.130
Yea, of course.

46:01.431 --> 46:05.068
Anna's normally a nice girl but
she's been acting very cranky

46:05.101 --> 46:09.005
lately and I was just wondering
if maybe it was her medication.

46:09.039 --> 46:12.643
Well sometimes patients do have
adverse emotional reactions to

46:12.675 --> 46:14.711
medications but
I think the biggest

46:14.744 --> 46:16.780
problem she has
is lack of sleep.

46:18.081 --> 46:20.451
I'm sure if she could just get a
really nice...

46:21.085 --> 46:23.554
good, decent, sleep, she'll be
much better off.

46:23.586 --> 46:25.690
Ok, I'm sure that's what it is.

46:26.757 --> 46:27.791
Thank you doctor.

46:33.697 --> 46:34.699
Hey, Anna.

46:36.365 --> 46:38.501
Do you need something to help
you sleep?

46:38.534 --> 46:39.971
I don't want your drugs.

46:41.371 --> 46:43.641
You think drugs are the solution
to everything.

46:44.273 --> 46:46.176
Anna,
you're showing some obvious

46:46.210 --> 46:47.811
signs of sleep deprivation.

46:48.311 --> 46:50.681
Ok, which can make you aggressie
and irritable.

46:50.713 --> 46:52.884
I could sleep if I could go
home.

46:53.416 --> 46:55.351
I wanna be in my own bed.

46:55.385 --> 46:57.288
And I completely understand
that.

46:58.255 --> 47:00.257
Look, we have tried
our very best to make

47:00.289 --> 47:02.527
you as comfortable as
you can be here but...

47:03.393 --> 47:05.262
it's not your home, it's not
your bed.

47:05.596 --> 47:07.731
You started out making really
good progress,

47:08.398 --> 47:11.402
has something happened? Is there
something you wanna talk about?

47:13.670 --> 47:15.505
I'm tired of being here for no
reason.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.342
Have you seen the
other patients? Because

47:19.376 --> 47:21.278
some of them are
pretty darn wacko.

47:22.112 --> 47:24.014
You honestly think I'm like
them?

47:24.047 --> 47:25.048
Anna, I'm not...

47:26.016 --> 47:27.751
the enemy here.
Ok? We're trying to

47:27.784 --> 47:29.519
help you as best we can.
I promise.

47:29.552 --> 47:31.054
Why do you feel like you don't

47:31.088 --> 47:33.057
wanna cooperate
with your treatment?

47:33.090 --> 47:35.093
Because I don't need treatment.

47:36.260 --> 47:38.696
Your job is to find something
wrong with me but your

47:38.728 --> 47:41.131
solution is to convince
me that it never happened?

47:41.764 --> 47:43.800
Anna, before you can even
start...

47:44.768 --> 47:47.003
to get better, you need to come
to grips with the truth.

47:47.036 --> 47:48.638
No, you need to get a grip.

47:49.072 --> 47:50.108
I know the truth!

47:51.208 --> 47:52.742
You don't believe me so you're

47:52.775 --> 47:54.745
holding me here
like a criminal but...

47:55.813 --> 47:58.583
I had a dream... is that a
crime?

48:01.885 --> 48:03.588
It's not my fault it came true.

48:05.155 --> 48:06.690
Anna, you're a very, very smart

48:06.722 --> 48:08.259
girl,
there's no doubt about that...

48:10.027 --> 48:11.628
but you've been
under a lot of stress

48:11.661 --> 48:13.096
and certainly a lack of sleep,

48:13.730 --> 48:14.932
and it doesn't help.

48:16.699 --> 48:18.902
Look, I'll be back to
check on you tomorrow

48:18.936 --> 48:20.838
but please,
try and get some sleep.

48:22.371 --> 48:24.375
I promise you'll feel a whole
lot better.

48:37.554 --> 48:39.023
Get up and come with us.

48:39.922 --> 48:41.424
Come on, Anna,

48:41.724 --> 48:45.195
Tiko's too excited to go back
to sleep cause there's a new

48:45.228 --> 48:48.765
patient. He won't go back to
bed unless we check her out,

48:49.099 --> 48:51.469
and he wants you to go on your
first spy mission.

48:53.269 --> 48:54.271
Why me?

48:54.938 --> 48:56.273
Come on, it'll be fun.

48:56.974 --> 48:59.376
It's about this woman who was in
a car accident.

48:59.909 --> 49:01.846
She was driving,
she had too little

49:01.878 --> 49:03.815
kids in the back and they died.

49:04.514 --> 49:05.516
I don't wanna go.

49:06.550 --> 49:08.885
I heard the nurses talking
earlier,

49:09.353 --> 49:12.023
the incident happened last
Friday.

49:13.222 --> 49:14.592
That was on my birthday.

49:15.157 --> 49:17.894
Anyways, I heard them
say she blames herself

49:17.927 --> 49:21.097
because she forgot
something and had to go back.

49:21.731 --> 49:23.900
And now they're dead.

49:25.402 --> 49:26.403
Stop it.

49:27.237 --> 49:28.905
You guys are creeping me out.

49:29.606 --> 49:31.809
Her room is just down
the hall from here,

49:31.842 --> 49:34.278
just c'mon, let's just
go take a little peek.

50:04.373 --> 50:07.277
You're the only one tall enough
to see through that window.

50:13.317 --> 50:14.784
I wanna see, pick me up.

50:16.119 --> 50:17.788
You can't see anything anyways.

50:18.255 --> 50:19.957
She's not looking this way.

50:19.989 --> 50:21.091
What is she doing?

50:23.492 --> 50:24.996
She's just sitting there.

50:39.242 --> 50:40.244
Mom!

50:45.849 --> 50:48.653
Are you ok? Honey, what
happened?

50:59.829 --> 51:01.699
Hey, hey, can I help you?

51:02.632 --> 51:04.101
Where's the new patient?

51:04.467 --> 51:05.501
What new patient?

51:05.534 --> 51:06.737
No, the new patient!

51:07.603 --> 51:10.974
That got here yesterday, a
woman, she was in this room!

51:11.440 --> 51:13.843
Look, honey, this room it's
been empty. Ok? We haven't

51:13.876 --> 51:16.480
had any new patients for weeks,
let's go find your nurse.

51:17.079 --> 51:19.048
C'mon, you're gonna be ok.
Let's get

51:19.081 --> 51:21.051
your meds, you'll be ok.
Alright?

51:21.818 --> 51:24.488
Are you ok? I think you just had
another bad dream ok?

51:25.288 --> 51:27.257
I'm ok, I just had a horrible
nightmare.

51:27.724 --> 51:30.260
Ok, do you want me to call the
doctor so you can talk about it?

51:30.293 --> 51:32.262
No! I'm... it's ok, I'm fine.

51:32.295 --> 51:33.931
Let's go back to your room.

51:35.264 --> 51:37.134
When's the last time you talked
to your mom?

51:37.166 --> 51:39.769
She was visiting last night so I
know it hasn't happened yet.

51:39.802 --> 51:42.505
Well, have you talked to anyone
else about it?

51:42.773 --> 51:43.874
No.

51:43.907 --> 51:45.042
You gotta believe me, I

51:45.074 --> 51:46.242
know nobody else will.

51:46.576 --> 51:47.978
Why don't we just call your mom

51:48.010 --> 51:49.746
and tell her about
your dream and...

51:49.780 --> 51:50.781
No!

51:51.181 --> 51:52.849
I know she won't believe me.

51:53.916 --> 51:55.185
She thinks I'm crazy.

51:55.652 --> 51:58.621
But you're stuck in here and you
won't tell anyone else but me,

51:59.188 --> 52:01.725
and there's no way of knowing if
or when it's even gonna happen.

52:02.958 --> 52:03.960
Wait.

52:06.096 --> 52:07.563
In my dream Tiko said the

52:07.597 --> 52:09.633
accident happened
on his birthday.

52:14.538 --> 52:15.204
Hello?

52:15.237 --> 52:16.373
Can I talk to Tiko, please?

52:17.407 --> 52:18.409
It's Anna.

52:19.708 --> 52:21.010
Anna, are you coming

52:21.043 --> 52:22.078
to my birthday party?

52:23.079 --> 52:24.114
When's your birthday?

52:24.146 --> 52:27.116
Well it isn't until tomorrow,
but my family's

52:27.150 --> 52:30.121
here today. So,
we were having a little party.

52:30.786 --> 52:31.788
What did he say?

52:34.657 --> 52:35.659
Tomorrow.

52:36.293 --> 52:38.061
You have to help me get out of
here!

52:38.094 --> 52:39.629
We have to do something.

52:39.663 --> 52:42.065
I'll be right back, I have to go
lock up my bike.

52:48.137 --> 52:50.740
Hey, it's Josh, there's
something I need to tell you.

52:54.577 --> 52:56.480
But, what if it is gonna happen?

52:57.079 --> 52:58.282
Like her last dream?

52:59.682 --> 53:01.751
Josh, Anna doesn't know what's

53:01.784 --> 53:02.886
real or not.

53:04.019 --> 53:06.222
She's very confused,
she's not gonna

53:06.255 --> 53:08.324
get better if you continue to...

53:08.358 --> 53:09.727
Who are you talking to?

53:12.528 --> 53:14.030
Did you just call my mom?

53:19.768 --> 53:21.438
How could you do that to me?

53:21.771 --> 53:23.441
I told you she doesn't believe
me!

53:23.873 --> 53:25.375
But now she's
gonna tell my doctor

53:25.407 --> 53:26.909
and I'm never
gonna get out of here!

53:26.943 --> 53:28.378
Anna, I'm sorry!
I thought she would

53:28.411 --> 53:30.213
believe us and then
we could stop her from...

53:30.246 --> 53:31.915
I thought I could trust you.

53:33.215 --> 53:34.351
What did you tell her?

53:34.384 --> 53:36.052
I told her that you had a
dream...

53:36.753 --> 53:38.756
and Jack and Emma died in a car
accident

53:39.389 --> 53:42.793
and your mom was driving, and a
girl ran in front of the car,

53:43.460 --> 53:45.128
but that's all that I got out.

53:46.128 --> 53:48.097
You're right, I'm sorry.
She thinks that you're

53:48.130 --> 53:50.134
confused and that you
don't know what's real.

53:52.001 --> 53:54.938
If someone could have stopped me
from lighting that match...

53:55.938 --> 53:57.440
to save my little sister.

53:58.474 --> 54:00.777
As your best friend, I was just
trying to help.

54:02.612 --> 54:04.548
I know, you know I know.

54:07.516 --> 54:08.518
Thank you.

54:10.586 --> 54:12.922
We have to figure out a way to
get out of here.

54:14.090 --> 54:15.826
Tomorrow my
brother and sister are

54:15.858 --> 54:17.594
gonna die if you don't help me.

54:18.961 --> 54:20.965
I think I know something that
could work,

54:22.231 --> 54:23.733
but you have to trust me.

54:24.601 --> 54:26.369
I'll think it all out
tonight and I'll

54:26.402 --> 54:28.071
be back in the
morning to get you.

54:28.471 --> 54:30.206
Try to get some sleep tonight,
ok?

54:43.253 --> 54:45.722
Did you guys here about that

54:45.989 --> 54:47.324
psycho killer...

54:48.391 --> 54:49.226
What killer?

54:49.259 --> 54:51.260
The guy going
around wearing that

54:51.293 --> 54:53.263
scary mask and killing people?

54:53.730 --> 54:56.266
You believe anything, don't you?
It's not even true.

54:56.298 --> 54:58.936
No! It is real, and the last I
heard the latest killing was...

54:58.969 --> 55:01.371
it was just the other day
and it was 10 miles from here.

55:02.838 --> 55:04.407
You are so gullible.

55:04.840 --> 55:06.777
Don't believe that crap, it's
fake news.

55:07.510 --> 55:08.512
It's true.

55:09.346 --> 55:11.815
I hear he likes to go
after skinny blondes who

55:11.847 --> 55:14.717
like to wear pink lip gloss
and who stink at pool.

55:15.619 --> 55:16.987
Ok, just, can you just shut up?

55:17.019 --> 55:18.688
You're really creeping me out.
Like...

55:19.121 --> 55:20.790
How am I supposed to sleep
tonight?

55:22.891 --> 55:24.193
Hey, leave her alone.

55:25.094 --> 55:27.063
Great,
now I have to go to the bathroom

55:27.097 --> 55:29.333
and I'm too afraid
to go pee by myself.

55:29.365 --> 55:31.768
Hey, watch out, he's
probably in the shower right

55:31.800 --> 55:34.572
now with his scary mask
on just waiting to jump out.

55:35.038 --> 55:36.039
Shut up!

55:36.472 --> 55:37.474
I'm not kidding.

55:38.907 --> 55:40.043
You're such a jerk!

56:42.072 --> 56:43.106
Sleep well, Anna.

56:54.751 --> 56:55.953
Mental Health Unit 3...

56:57.286 --> 56:59.055
No, I'm the only one here till
noon.

57:00.623 --> 57:02.059
No, I'll take care of it.

57:02.858 --> 57:04.027
I'll be right there.

57:14.603 --> 57:16.505
C'mon, we don't have much time.

57:16.539 --> 57:18.575
What'd you do? What took you so
long?

57:18.608 --> 57:20.344
I'll tell you later, we gotta
go.

57:28.385 --> 57:29.620
Crap, we need a code.

57:30.586 --> 57:31.922
Where are you going?

57:33.023 --> 57:35.726
I need to leave, don't tell
anybody you saw me.

57:36.425 --> 57:38.961
Are you coming back? You can't
leave on my birthday.

57:39.695 --> 57:41.364
Were you even gonna say goodbye?

57:42.699 --> 57:45.068
Look, we need to help
someone or something really bad

57:45.101 --> 57:47.538
is gonna happen, so don't
tell anybody that we left.

57:48.271 --> 57:49.273
Let's go.

57:50.206 --> 57:51.875
Can I come with you? I wanna
help.

57:52.442 --> 57:54.510
No, you have to stay
here and make sure no

57:54.543 --> 57:56.547
one knows we left.
That's how you can help.

57:56.780 --> 57:57.781
Ok?

58:00.416 --> 58:01.351
Stop!

58:05.422 --> 58:07.023
Security, I have a Code E.
I have a

58:07.056 --> 58:09.059
female patient with
a male accomplice.

58:09.092 --> 58:11.494
They were last seen heading
down South Wing Hall.

58:17.666 --> 58:19.268
- Which way?
- I don't know.

58:23.572 --> 58:24.574
Hey.

58:54.771 --> 58:55.705
There they are!

58:55.737 --> 58:56.739
- Run!
- Great!

59:24.934 --> 59:25.802
We lost them.

59:25.835 --> 59:27.538
Yea, but how do we get out of
here?

59:33.041 --> 59:34.143
Takota!

59:34.177 --> 59:35.812
Where are you going in such a
hurry?

59:35.844 --> 59:37.413
Get up, we gotta go.

59:38.081 --> 59:39.750
There isn't time to explain.

59:40.282 --> 59:41.985
We've gotta get outta here.
I had

59:42.018 --> 59:44.253
another dream and I
have to do something.

59:45.355 --> 59:46.356
Can you help us?

59:47.190 --> 59:48.258
Come on, let's go.

59:48.557 --> 59:51.461
Anushka, it means one who
fulfills their destiny.

59:55.898 --> 59:58.067
For your journey, please take
this with you.

59:58.534 --> 1:00:01.471
Embrace your dreams and set them
free and you too will be free.

1:00:03.873 --> 1:00:05.809
- We have to go now.
- Thank you so much.

1:00:17.554 --> 1:00:18.555
Did we lose 'em?

1:00:19.222 --> 1:00:22.092
Yea, call the police and make a
report.

1:00:22.559 --> 1:00:24.794
Tell them these kids are
considered dangerous. I don't

1:00:24.827 --> 1:00:27.097
know what they're up to
but I'm not risking anything.

1:00:27.396 --> 1:00:28.565
That was your plan?

1:00:28.965 --> 1:00:30.800
What was that? They almost
caught us.

1:00:30.833 --> 1:00:33.336
Well I didn't have a lot of time
to plan the escape.

1:00:34.237 --> 1:00:36.072
That reminds me, just wait right
here.

1:00:40.976 --> 1:00:42.478
Here, put this on.

1:00:47.182 --> 1:00:48.784
You brought me a disguise?

1:00:48.818 --> 1:00:50.720
Well I couldn't have
you running around town

1:00:50.753 --> 1:00:52.856
looking all crazy and
expect not to get caught.

1:00:57.827 --> 1:00:59.530
That janitor, why did he help
us?

1:01:00.295 --> 1:01:02.098
I'll tell you later, we have to
hurry.

1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:07.570
Here take this, my mom has them,
she's paranoid

1:01:07.603 --> 1:01:09.639
someone might grab her.
You might need it.

1:01:11.974 --> 1:01:13.242
I don't think I can...

1:01:13.576 --> 1:01:15.579
Here, please, just put it in
your pocket.

1:01:15.811 --> 1:01:17.380
Don't be afraid to use it.

1:01:17.947 --> 1:01:18.949
Take it.

1:01:27.590 --> 1:01:28.725
You look exhausted.

1:01:29.057 --> 1:01:30.927
Yea,
I didn't get much sleep last

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:32.795
night with what's been going on.

1:01:35.130 --> 1:01:37.733
I kept having these bad dreams
about a guy in a mask.

1:01:38.668 --> 1:01:39.670
Oh no...

1:01:40.903 --> 1:01:43.106
please don't tell me we have to
figure out what that means.

1:01:43.905 --> 1:01:44.907
Who knows...

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:47.376
but we have too much to worry
about.

1:01:47.409 --> 1:01:50.079
I think I might actually start
losing my mind for real.

1:01:51.114 --> 1:01:52.115
Too late.

1:01:52.614 --> 1:01:53.317
I'm kidding.

1:01:56.018 --> 1:01:57.152
Who the heck is that?

1:01:57.186 --> 1:01:58.855
That's part of my plan, let's
go.

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.303
Where are we going? I don't even
know where we are.

1:02:16.905 --> 1:02:18.976
Central and Concord, please.

1:02:20.777 --> 1:02:22.445
About how far is that exactly?

1:02:23.378 --> 1:02:24.681
Less than 10 miles.

1:02:24.713 --> 1:02:25.748
We're in a huge hurry.

1:02:25.782 --> 1:02:27.617
It's kind of a life or death
matter.

1:02:27.650 --> 1:02:29.086
Stop, that isn't funny.

1:02:30.286 --> 1:02:31.989
How much time do you think we
have?

1:02:33.222 --> 1:02:35.925
I don't know, my mom
usually gets the kids from the

1:02:35.958 --> 1:02:37.460
babysitter's house around 3

1:02:37.492 --> 1:02:39.395
o'clock,
then she'll be heading...

1:02:41.496 --> 1:02:43.599
Hey, hey, it's fine,
it's fine, we're gonna

1:02:43.632 --> 1:02:45.735
have enough time.
It's gonna be ok, alright?

1:02:46.501 --> 1:02:47.837
Absolutely not, honey.

1:02:49.105 --> 1:02:50.773
No, because that's dangerous.

1:02:51.641 --> 1:02:53.909
Make sure that I'm there when
you try and do that.

1:02:53.943 --> 1:02:55.278
Doctor, doctor, we have a
problem.

1:02:55.311 --> 1:02:56.211
I have to go, honey.

1:02:56.244 --> 1:02:57.146
Come quick please.

1:02:57.179 --> 1:02:58.848
Ok, ok, calm down, calm down.

1:03:08.123 --> 1:03:09.425
Can we go any faster?

1:03:09.458 --> 1:03:11.961
No, sorry. Bad traffic.

1:03:14.362 --> 1:03:16.065
How much further down is
Concord?

1:03:16.398 --> 1:03:17.567
We're almost there.

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:18.802
Now I see it.

1:03:20.202 --> 1:03:21.905
Let's just get out here.
It'll be

1:03:21.938 --> 1:03:23.706
faster to walk the
last few blocks.

1:03:23.739 --> 1:03:24.807
Ok, ok, sorry.

1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:26.907
Wait, wait, wait, you can't get
out like that. Wait.

1:03:26.909 --> 1:03:28.811
Sorry, sorry. Keep the change.

1:03:40.422 --> 1:03:41.424
Dear Dr. Jenkins,

1:03:42.391 --> 1:03:44.461
I know you don't believe my
dreams are real,

1:03:45.128 --> 1:03:46.329
but yours come true.

1:03:47.063 --> 1:03:49.365
You'll receive your
funding and if that's

1:03:49.398 --> 1:03:51.735
just not enough,
your wife gets her kidney.

1:03:52.568 --> 1:03:55.138
I'm still learning to believe
and now it's your turn,

1:03:56.105 --> 1:03:57.106
Anna.

1:03:59.675 --> 1:04:02.546
You know, doctor, we could never
really hold that girl down.

1:04:04.413 --> 1:04:06.583
I just have a feeling that she's
gonna be...

1:04:06.949 --> 1:04:08.284
where she needs to be.

1:04:27.969 --> 1:04:28.971
Hey, Anna.

1:04:30.206 --> 1:04:32.142
In my dream it said, Concord St.

1:04:33.409 --> 1:04:34.611
This is Concord Road!

1:04:35.210 --> 1:04:38.113
How can their be a road and a
street with the same name?

1:04:38.146 --> 1:04:40.784
You know I don't know, but this
definitely isn't it.

1:04:40.817 --> 1:04:43.085
Well, what the heck are we
supposed to do now?

1:04:48.157 --> 1:04:50.260
This says our first quarter was

1:04:50.293 --> 1:04:51.528
extremely positive,

1:04:51.561 --> 1:04:53.230
second quarter not so far
behind.

1:04:53.963 --> 1:04:57.200
I think that's why it's so
vital that we, that we really

1:04:57.233 --> 1:05:00.737
go after the economy in this
current climate the way it is.

1:05:01.336 --> 1:05:02.338
That's...

1:05:03.005 --> 1:05:04.173
Cindy?

1:05:05.608 --> 1:05:07.577
Cindy. Cindy, Cindy Miller.

1:05:08.677 --> 1:05:12.581
Look, I understand that you're
dealing with some pretty...

1:05:13.048 --> 1:05:15.652
severe family issues now with
your daughter and...

1:05:15.684 --> 1:05:19.755
Yea, I'm sorry. I won't let my
family life effect my work.

1:05:20.255 --> 1:05:21.924
It's ok, anyways.

1:05:22.458 --> 1:05:24.126
So again, back to where we were.

1:05:24.393 --> 1:05:26.762
The third and fourth quarter
still up for grabs.

1:05:29.931 --> 1:05:30.933
Excuse me.

1:05:32.802 --> 1:05:33.670
Can you help us?

1:05:33.702 --> 1:05:35.871
What's the problem? You kids
look lost.

1:05:36.405 --> 1:05:37.907
We're not from around here, do

1:05:37.940 --> 1:05:39.442
you know where
Concord Street is?

1:05:39.474 --> 1:05:40.777
How far's the street from here?

1:05:40.809 --> 1:05:42.679
Well,
you just go down Central Ave

1:05:42.711 --> 1:05:44.547
right here and just go straight

1:05:44.579 --> 1:05:46.583
under the overpass,
and it's maybe

1:05:46.615 --> 1:05:48.617
a half a mile or so.
You'll see it.

1:05:49.485 --> 1:05:50.452
Alright, thank you.

1:05:50.485 --> 1:05:51.821
Ok, you're welcome.

1:06:25.186 --> 1:06:26.221
Hey, can I ask you

1:06:26.255 --> 1:06:27.356
guys a couple questions?

1:06:27.389 --> 1:06:28.391
Anna, run, go!

1:06:29.291 --> 1:06:30.293
Hey!

1:07:46.568 --> 1:07:47.936
I was trying to
get the kids ready

1:07:47.969 --> 1:07:49.371
cause you said
you were in a rush.

1:07:49.405 --> 1:07:51.274
Yea, Jack has a doctors
appointment.

1:07:51.306 --> 1:07:52.375
Mommy!

1:07:55.543 --> 1:07:58.580
I missed you so much, all day,
mommy.

1:07:58.614 --> 1:08:00.650
Oh... I missed you too.

1:08:03.885 --> 1:08:04.521
Awe.

1:08:04.753 --> 1:08:05.954
Ok...

1:08:05.987 --> 1:08:08.991
- Say goodbye to Krissy.
- Bye, Kris Kris.

1:08:09.025 --> 1:08:11.193
- See you later.
- Ok let's go.

1:08:57.439 --> 1:08:58.840
Hey, she's taking your bike!

1:09:00.909 --> 1:09:02.077
What are you doing?

1:09:02.411 --> 1:09:03.945
Don't worry, we'll get it back.

1:09:46.921 --> 1:09:47.923
No!

1:09:56.465 --> 1:09:57.699
How can that be?

1:10:00.636 --> 1:10:01.638
Am I crazy?

1:10:03.538 --> 1:10:05.340
She's blames herself because she

1:10:05.373 --> 1:10:07.443
forgot something
and had to go back.

1:10:13.215 --> 1:10:14.217
Hello, hey.

1:10:15.717 --> 1:10:18.421
Krissy, oh you've gotta be
kidding me, ok...

1:10:19.087 --> 1:10:22.257
No, I just have so much on my
mind, I'm gonna turn around. Ok.

1:10:27.563 --> 1:10:30.132
That's not your bike! That's my
friend's bike.

1:10:31.167 --> 1:10:32.235
You're gonna pay!

1:10:42.610 --> 1:10:43.613
Stop!

1:10:44.412 --> 1:10:46.148
We can't let her get away with
this.

1:10:48.516 --> 1:10:50.353
That girl stole our friend's
bike.

1:10:51.953 --> 1:10:53.389
Don't worry, we'll catch her and

1:10:53.421 --> 1:10:55.090
teach her a lesson for you.
Let's go.

1:11:00.962 --> 1:11:03.899
Hey you! It's not nice to take
people's stuff!

1:11:04.199 --> 1:11:05.367
Oh great, not them.

1:11:11.907 --> 1:11:13.109
Hey, that's Anna!

1:11:14.475 --> 1:11:16.077
She thinks she can cause trouble

1:11:16.110 --> 1:11:17.713
in our neighborhood?
Oh no, no, no.

1:11:18.213 --> 1:11:19.782
Where's your little
friend Josh now?

1:11:19.814 --> 1:11:21.550
You mean he's not
here to save you?

1:11:21.583 --> 1:11:24.619
C'mon guys, a really bad car
accident is about to happen.

1:11:24.653 --> 1:11:26.556
Yea right, we heard you went all

1:11:26.588 --> 1:11:28.490
crazy,
guess the rumors are true.

1:11:30.091 --> 1:11:30.759
Guys stop.

1:11:30.993 --> 1:11:31.961
Yea, make us.

1:11:31.993 --> 1:11:32.996
No, stop!

1:11:33.828 --> 1:11:34.831
Whoa!

1:11:38.466 --> 1:11:39.768
Well that was smooth.

1:11:40.235 --> 1:11:41.837
Get up, she's getting away.

1:11:50.078 --> 1:11:51.980
Oh, thank you Krissy, so much.

1:11:52.014 --> 1:11:53.016
You're welcome.

1:11:54.283 --> 1:11:55.285
See you Monday!

1:12:03.958 --> 1:12:06.695
C'mon you sissy, you're not even
hurt. She went this way.

1:12:55.577 --> 1:12:56.579
Here, Emma...

1:12:58.279 --> 1:12:59.414
Here take this bag.

1:13:00.481 --> 1:13:01.884
Can you grab his bottle? It's in

1:13:01.917 --> 1:13:03.453
one of the pockets there.
Thanks.

1:13:04.185 --> 1:13:05.255
Here it is, mommy.

1:13:05.854 --> 1:13:07.856
Oh, thank you! Good job.

1:13:26.574 --> 1:13:28.243
The bike's still over there.

1:13:45.293 --> 1:13:48.197
I know but I told him
that if I was gonna go on

1:13:48.229 --> 1:13:51.134
this trip with him he was
gonna have to... shoot!

1:13:52.067 --> 1:13:53.269
I can't find my keys...

1:13:54.168 --> 1:13:55.604
and I don't think Laura's home.

1:13:55.636 --> 1:13:57.472
I'm just gonna have
to call you back. Ok?

1:14:01.542 --> 1:14:04.680
Mommy...
can you put it on number 8?

1:14:04.912 --> 1:14:07.250
That's my most favorite.

1:14:24.699 --> 1:14:25.768
I'm gettin' there.

1:14:33.442 --> 1:14:35.243
Help! Someone help!

1:14:38.579 --> 1:14:39.582
No!

1:14:39.981 --> 1:14:41.350
Run, Josh, run!

1:15:02.237 --> 1:15:03.239
Josh?

1:15:05.506 --> 1:15:07.442
Dude, where did you come from?

1:15:08.042 --> 1:15:09.577
You came out of no where.

1:15:09.610 --> 1:15:11.847
Julie, he just saved your life.

1:15:12.346 --> 1:15:15.417
No, you guys almost got me
killed.

1:15:15.451 --> 1:15:17.420
I'm so sorry, we were just being
stupid.

1:15:17.453 --> 1:15:18.421
Oh my gosh!

1:15:18.453 --> 1:15:20.155
We didn't think that this would
happen, Julie.

1:15:20.189 --> 1:15:22.057
I don't,
I thought you would see it

1:15:22.090 --> 1:15:23.960
was just me and
not freak out so bad.

1:15:29.530 --> 1:15:30.733
Wow, Anna was right.

1:15:36.204 --> 1:15:37.206
How?

1:15:43.145 --> 1:15:45.381
Anna? Oh I'm so sorry.

1:15:45.747 --> 1:15:48.083
You tried to tell me, I didn't
know, I didn't know.

1:15:48.115 --> 1:15:49.217
Mom, it's ok.

1:15:49.984 --> 1:15:51.319
It doesn't matter now.

1:15:53.488 --> 1:15:55.690
Everyone's safe. That's all that
matters now.

1:15:55.724 --> 1:15:56.726
Sissy!

1:15:58.894 --> 1:15:59.896
Awe.

1:16:02.363 --> 1:16:04.065
Anna, you're bleeding. Are you
ok?

1:16:05.067 --> 1:16:07.837
Yea, I'm fine, it's really not
that bad.

1:16:10.538 --> 1:16:11.541
Are you ok?

1:16:12.875 --> 1:16:14.676
What are you doing with that?

1:16:14.710 --> 1:16:16.345
We bought it last night to scare

1:16:16.377 --> 1:16:18.280
Julie with it,
it was just for a joke.

1:16:24.118 --> 1:16:25.753
I don't know how
I can ever repay

1:16:25.787 --> 1:16:27.457
you for what you
did for me today.

1:16:28.189 --> 1:16:30.492
You don't have to think of a way
to repay me.

1:16:30.525 --> 1:16:33.395
Losing my sister was the worst
thing that ever happened to me.

1:16:34.061 --> 1:16:36.131
I knew I couldn't let you go
through that.

1:16:36.465 --> 1:16:38.868
I've always dreamed of having a
friend like you.

1:16:39.301 --> 1:16:40.870
I just wish that I could promise

1:16:40.903 --> 1:16:42.472
to make all your
dreams come true.

1:16:43.572 --> 1:16:44.739
Wait...

1:16:44.773 --> 1:16:46.275
maybe I should promise to never

1:16:46.307 --> 1:16:47.877
let any of your
dreams come true.

1:16:48.377 --> 1:16:49.378
Wow.

1:16:49.912 --> 1:16:51.347
Is there something wrong with
you?

1:16:51.380 --> 1:16:53.615
There will be if anything ever
happens to you.

1:16:54.750 --> 1:16:56.118
I care about you, Anna.

1:16:56.618 --> 1:16:58.120
I promise,
no matter what happens

1:16:58.153 --> 1:16:59.555
I'll always be here for you...

1:17:00.421 --> 1:17:01.356
but for now...

1:17:02.390 --> 1:17:03.592
you have to go back.

1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:07.430
Promise me...
you'll come back to me.

1:17:10.164 --> 1:17:11.466
Anna, can you hear me?

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:12.835
It's mommy, can you hear me?

1:17:13.435 --> 1:17:14.437
Honey?

1:17:15.770 --> 1:17:16.905
Is she gonna be ok?

1:17:17.271 --> 1:17:19.240
Why does her
heart rate keep going

1:17:19.274 --> 1:17:21.277
up?
It was calm just a minute ago.

1:17:21.777 --> 1:17:24.279
She just suffered some trauma to
the head...

1:17:25.247 --> 1:17:27.216
and the heart rate,
it could just be that she's

1:17:27.248 --> 1:17:29.217
dreaming, that means
her brain is still active.

1:17:29.618 --> 1:17:30.620
It's good.

1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:33.722
Anna...

1:17:34.122 --> 1:17:35.124
Can you hear me?

1:17:40.061 --> 1:17:42.631
Why do I have to go back?

1:17:44.131 --> 1:17:45.134
What?

1:17:47.135 --> 1:17:48.804
Honey, what are you talking
about?

1:17:49.371 --> 1:17:51.105
Mam, just give her a moment,
just give

1:17:51.139 --> 1:17:52.841
her a moment to
figure things out.

1:17:52.873 --> 1:17:54.143
Where's Josh?

1:17:55.143 --> 1:17:55.844
What?

1:17:55.877 --> 1:17:56.879
Josh...

1:17:57.112 --> 1:17:58.114
Who's Josh?

1:17:58.779 --> 1:18:02.018
Josh Mason... my best friend.

1:18:02.917 --> 1:18:05.153
Where is he? Who took him?

1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:06.855
Please...

1:18:07.789 --> 1:18:09.358
Hey, you really are a brave
little girl.

1:18:09.390 --> 1:18:10.926
I mean you took a big hit...

1:18:11.726 --> 1:18:13.729
and you got a big bump there to
prove it.

1:18:14.395 --> 1:18:16.064
So do you remember anything,

1:18:16.564 --> 1:18:18.567
anything at all that might have
happened?

1:18:20.902 --> 1:18:23.271
Anna... do you know who I am?

1:18:23.939 --> 1:18:27.443
You're... my... mom.

1:18:28.777 --> 1:18:31.180
Yea, that's right. I'm your
mommy.

1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:34.783
Alright, let's go, c'mon!

1:18:36.184 --> 1:18:37.686
Strike three, batter's out.

1:18:37.719 --> 1:18:39.588
Awe, that's ok! It's alright.

1:18:43.958 --> 1:18:46.127
I don't know why I just can't
play...

1:18:46.627 --> 1:18:50.032
maybe we wouldn't be losing so
bad. I feel fine, mom.

1:18:50.731 --> 1:18:54.537
Oh, honey, I know that you wanna
play, I do,

1:18:54.903 --> 1:18:56.704
but the doctor says
you need to take

1:18:56.738 --> 1:18:58.541
it easy for just
a little bit longer.

1:18:58.939 --> 1:19:01.476
And, you can be here for your
team, cheering them on.

1:19:03.244 --> 1:19:06.082
That's not fun. I want to play
ball!

1:19:08.550 --> 1:19:10.386
Hey, Becky's up,
c'mon let's cheer for her.

1:19:10.418 --> 1:19:11.420
Becky, let's go!

1:19:17.658 --> 1:19:19.594
C'mon, bring it in, we'll get
'em next time.

1:19:20.095 --> 1:19:22.664
Oh also Allison's gonna
take you to the park for a

1:19:22.698 --> 1:19:25.534
picnic tomorrow, so you
have that to look forward to.

1:19:25.833 --> 1:19:26.501
Ok.

1:19:26.534 --> 1:19:27.536
Ok.

1:19:27.769 --> 1:19:29.405
You ready to have some fun?

1:19:29.438 --> 1:19:30.372
Do you wanna eat first,

1:19:30.404 --> 1:19:32.073
or you wanna
play for a few minutes?

1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:35.176
I'm a little hungry, but can I
just swing first?

1:19:35.743 --> 1:19:37.412
Sure, go ahead for a few
minutes.

1:19:54.895 --> 1:19:56.197
I wanna play too.

1:19:57.765 --> 1:20:00.568
Now don't come out
no matter what until

1:20:00.601 --> 1:20:04.206
someone finds you.
Stay here and be very quiet.

1:20:04.872 --> 1:20:06.975
Ok, I won't. Shh.

1:20:07.542 --> 1:20:10.312
Wow, Anna, you're getting really
high this time.

1:20:11.613 --> 1:20:14.383
Watch Allie, I'm gonna swing
higher than those houses.

1:20:17.819 --> 1:20:19.488
I'd give anything to go back.

1:20:20.221 --> 1:20:22.023
Find strength in your destiny.

1:20:22.056 --> 1:20:25.560
Believe in yourself, Anna,
and you will do great things.

1:20:28.630 --> 1:20:30.132
What if we get in trouble?

1:20:30.164 --> 1:20:31.934
We won't cause no one will find
out.

1:20:32.501 --> 1:20:34.670
Let's just go find Maggie, just
wait.

1:20:39.908 --> 1:20:42.144
I really have to go to the
bathroom.

1:20:42.644 --> 1:20:43.646
I'll go with you.

1:20:44.880 --> 1:20:47.917
No, I can go by myself! It's
just over there, I'll be quick.

1:20:48.283 --> 1:20:50.486
I'll get the sandwiches ready
but hurry back.

1:21:08.203 --> 1:21:09.205
Ow!

1:21:16.377 --> 1:21:18.679
We have to go back up there and
try to put it out!

1:21:18.712 --> 1:21:20.815
Are you crazy? We're in huge
trouble.

1:21:21.283 --> 1:21:23.953
I told you not to light it,
let's just get out of here.

1:21:52.146 --> 1:21:54.283
Maggie, come with me, we have to
hurry.

1:22:02.690 --> 1:22:05.027
Don't be afraid, we're going to
get out of here.

1:22:09.965 --> 1:22:12.100
Come on,
we have to run as fast as we

1:22:12.132 --> 1:22:14.302
can down the hall
and through the fire.

1:22:14.769 --> 1:22:16.038
I don't want to.

1:22:19.039 --> 1:22:21.275
Maggie, we have to... just close

1:22:21.309 --> 1:22:23.546
your eyes and
we'll run together.

1:22:48.970 --> 1:22:50.606
Josh, where is your sister?

1:22:51.672 --> 1:22:52.907
Oh God! No.

1:22:56.344 --> 1:22:58.212
Maggie, she's still in there!

1:22:58.246 --> 1:23:00.215
I'll go get her, get the boys
outta here.

1:23:00.247 --> 1:23:01.182
Alright.

1:23:04.719 --> 1:23:05.721
Maggie!

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:07.523
Maggie!

1:23:08.122 --> 1:23:09.123
C'mon.

1:23:21.636 --> 1:23:22.638
You alright?

1:23:39.487 --> 1:23:41.390
Mam, is there anybody left in
the house?

1:23:41.422 --> 1:23:44.260
No, everyone got out safe. Thank
God.

1:23:44.559 --> 1:23:47.329
No, mommy, there's still a girl
inside.

1:23:47.895 --> 1:23:49.096
What girl, honey?

1:23:49.130 --> 1:23:51.432
The girl who saved me from the
fire.

1:23:51.932 --> 1:23:54.569
Josh, did you boys see
another girl in the house?

1:23:54.601 --> 1:23:57.072
Maggie says a girl
saved her from the fire.

1:23:57.305 --> 1:24:00.075
No, mom, there's no girl, she's
making it up.

1:24:00.942 --> 1:24:01.944
Anna!

1:24:02.844 --> 1:24:03.846
Anna!

1:24:09.216 --> 1:24:11.786
Here come on, we need to go...
We don't wanna get trapped here.

1:24:26.100 --> 1:24:27.101
What's wrong?

1:24:55.796 --> 1:24:56.798
Anna!

1:24:57.097 --> 1:24:58.801
What on Earth are you doing?

1:24:59.300 --> 1:25:01.869
I can't find my ice skates
anywhere.

1:25:02.103 --> 1:25:04.639
Well once you find them make
sure you clean all this up, put

1:25:04.671 --> 1:25:05.806
everything away. Your mother

1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:07.208
would have a
fit if she saw this.

1:25:07.242 --> 1:25:08.243
Ok.

1:25:14.416 --> 1:25:15.417
Finally.

1:25:31.298 --> 1:25:33.301
Your dreams aren't ordinary
dreams, Anna.

1:25:34.735 --> 1:25:36.270
You should be more careful. How

1:25:36.304 --> 1:25:37.873
many times have
I saved your life?

1:25:38.773 --> 1:25:40.876
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

1:25:43.444 --> 1:25:44.545
I'm scared.

1:25:44.578 --> 1:25:45.880
Anna, don't move!

1:25:50.417 --> 1:25:51.085
No!

1:25:51.386 --> 1:25:52.388
Help!

1:25:53.621 --> 1:25:54.623
Help!

1:25:59.293 --> 1:26:01.697
I could be your guardian angel.

1:26:10.939 --> 1:26:12.307
Hang on, Josh,

1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:13.708
it doesn't look very stable.

1:26:14.109 --> 1:26:15.110
Mom!

1:26:18.212 --> 1:26:19.782
Help! Somebody!

1:26:20.081 --> 1:26:21.083
Help me!

1:26:22.917 --> 1:26:24.286
Hold on, Josh, hold on!

1:26:24.685 --> 1:26:25.586
Oh God, no!

1:26:31.859 --> 1:26:33.094
I saw it dive

1:26:33.127 --> 1:26:34.262
because I was there.

1:26:36.029 --> 1:26:37.698
I saw the whole thing.

1:26:39.033 --> 1:26:40.736
I don't know how he could be ok.

1:26:41.903 --> 1:26:43.204
He seems fine, honey.

1:26:44.037 --> 1:26:45.573
If it makes you feel any better,
we'll

1:26:45.606 --> 1:26:47.509
have him checked out,
but he's a tough kid.

1:26:47.542 --> 1:26:51.012
I saw who saved you, she
was your angel, she was the girl

1:26:51.045 --> 1:26:54.483
who saved me from the fire.
She wanted you to have this.

1:26:57.385 --> 1:26:59.387
You have to think of a way to

1:26:59.420 --> 1:27:01.489
make it up to me that
doesn't involve you dying.

1:27:27.715 --> 1:27:29.050
Promise me,

1:27:29.082 --> 1:27:30.384
you'll come back to me.

1:27:51.773 --> 1:27:53.708
I promise I'll come back to you.
