WEBVTT

00:15.928 --> 00:17.060
Looking good
this morning, Merri.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.235
Feeling cold, Reilly.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.368
Really cold.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.022
If it's any consolation,

00:22.065 --> 00:23.066
you look the opposite.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.546
By which I mean...

00:24.589 --> 00:25.503
hot.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.288
Thank you for clarifying.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.594
You are nothing
if not relentless.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.553
Hey, nobody ever hits
a home run without
stepping up to the plate.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.555
And nothing turns
on a woman more

00:33.598 --> 00:37.167
than a good baseball metaphor
in subzero temperatures.

00:37.211 --> 00:40.562
That's not subzero.
This is subzero.

00:40.605 --> 00:41.998
And I love it.
It's invigorating.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.913
You know,
good for the blood flow.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.436
Stamina.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.003
And I've been vaccinated,
just saying.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.787
Gosh, I can't wait for business
to get back to normal,

00:48.831 --> 00:51.834
so I can afford to cook
with fresh veggies again.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.749
But then you'd never
-get to see me.
-Oh, yeah.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.143
That's a real Sophie's choice.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.233
Hey, you ordered peas, right?

01:00.103 --> 01:01.278
Here's a loose bag.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.063
On the house.

01:03.106 --> 01:06.849
Now, tell me about this, uh,
Sophie girl...

01:41.188 --> 01:44.191
"And while I know that staying
in Afghanistan is right for me,

01:44.234 --> 01:45.844
"I do regret not
getting to say goodbye

01:45.888 --> 01:47.368
to each of you in person."

01:47.411 --> 01:49.631
"So as a way of saying
'Till we meet again,'

01:49.674 --> 01:53.156
I hereby bequeath the following
items from my office."

01:53.200 --> 01:55.724
"To McGee, I leave
my electric stapler,

01:55.767 --> 01:58.770
since he used it
every chance he could."

01:58.814 --> 02:00.990
Yeah. "And to Ellie,
I leave my shiatsu

02:01.033 --> 02:04.167
massage bar, since she borrowed
it every chance she could."

02:04.211 --> 02:05.125
Ah, yes.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.039
"And to Nick, I
officially award

02:07.083 --> 02:09.259
"full custody of Carl,

02:09.303 --> 02:10.869
because I know he'll
take good care of him."

02:10.913 --> 02:13.568
Aw.
What? No. No.

02:13.611 --> 02:16.614
Come on. You guys got all cool
stuff and I get a damn fish?

02:16.658 --> 02:17.702
-He's been with you all week.
-Look, one thing

02:17.746 --> 02:20.052
is keeping him alive for a week.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.880
The other is permanently.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.143
Well, obviously she thinks
you need it, Nick.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.188
Yeah, like I need
that back massager.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.016
You know, this e-mail's
just to the three of us.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.496
I wonder what she left Gibbs.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.845
You mean,
besides a broken heart?

02:29.888 --> 02:32.064
I think he's been a lot
chipper since he got back.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.718
Yeah, I know, right?

02:33.762 --> 02:35.503
I mean, he seems to be taking
Sloane's loss pretty well.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.505
I didn't know she was lost.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.463
Unless you know
something I don't.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.335
Uh, no, boss, we're just
talking about the fact

02:41.378 --> 02:43.075
that she's staying
in Afghanistan.

02:43.119 --> 02:44.773
Yeah, I heard about that.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.905
Gear up. Got a body in Douglass.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.778
Bundle up, kids.

02:54.826 --> 02:55.914
Ms. Hines?

02:55.958 --> 02:57.742
Director.

02:57.786 --> 03:01.659
I take it Agent Sloane left
a memento for you as well?

03:01.703 --> 03:02.834
She did.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.532
Yeah, but that's
not why I'm here.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.838
I just came to think.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.928
Here as opposed
to your own office?

03:09.972 --> 03:12.757
Force of habit. I've...

03:12.801 --> 03:15.151
actually been consulting
with Jack semi-regularly

03:15.195 --> 03:18.981
since that whole
diner hostage thing last year.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.417
Per your suggestion,

03:20.461 --> 03:22.593
-if you recall.
-Yeah.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.421
I-I recall. She was helpful?

03:24.465 --> 03:27.555
Oh, very.
So much so,

03:27.598 --> 03:30.340
I find myself drawn here
whenever I need to...

03:30.384 --> 03:32.342
collect my thoughts, I guess.

03:32.386 --> 03:34.431
Everything we've been through

03:34.475 --> 03:36.607
the past year or so...

03:36.651 --> 03:38.696
Uh-huh.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.220
But why do I get the feeling

03:40.263 --> 03:42.047
that there's-there's something
more personal, like...

03:42.091 --> 03:44.180
But not-not that it's
any of my business.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.662
No, it's fine,
just family stuff.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.404
My sister got furloughed
from her job

03:50.447 --> 03:53.668
and then she lost her apartment.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.975
She had to move back in
with our mom and...

03:57.019 --> 03:58.281
ugh, let's just say
the two of them

03:58.325 --> 03:59.848
love each other best from afar.

03:59.891 --> 04:03.243
I-I am familiar
with that dynamic.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.332
Yeah, I was up half the night
on the phone playing referee.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.814
And I am late
to a budget meeting.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.555
I sure could use
a referee on this.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.557
Ugh.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.691
Uh, but listen, um,

04:16.734 --> 04:18.388
you-- if you need
a few days off...

04:18.432 --> 04:21.086
Uh, no, not at all. I-I'm fine.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.523
Okay.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.841
All right, that's close enough.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.756
I never get to say that.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.021
Victim is, uh, Petty Officer
Martin Delfino, 25.

04:43.065 --> 04:46.373
Currently listed as U.A.
from the USS <i>Patrick Goodell.</i>

04:46.416 --> 04:48.462
Failed to report for muster
at midnight last night.

04:48.505 --> 04:49.898
Where is his ship now?

04:49.941 --> 04:52.117
Uh, prepared to
depart out of Norfolk.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.424
Delfino was, uh,
scheduled for mandatory

04:54.468 --> 04:56.034
quarantine pre-deployment.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.341
Neither of the witnesses
knows the victim,

04:58.385 --> 05:01.388
and the driver has no idea how
the body got in his truck.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.259
You got any cause
of death, Palmer?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.435
Yeah, we may have to wait
until he thaws out a bit.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.481
Uh, it appears to be
a head wound, but, uh,

05:07.524 --> 05:10.440
judging by his somewhat
casual pose, I'd say

05:10.484 --> 05:12.137
he was dead before he froze.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.052
No rhyme intended there.

05:16.098 --> 05:19.319
Hey. Third call today and
you don't even leave a message.

05:19.362 --> 05:20.363
Everything okay?

05:20.407 --> 05:21.930
Couldn't be better, Butch.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.541
I just had some big news
to share,

05:24.585 --> 05:26.369
and voice mail wouldn't do.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.588
You got a minute?

05:27.631 --> 05:28.589
No.

05:28.632 --> 05:29.720
Why, what is it?

05:29.764 --> 05:31.722
It's way too big
without telling you

05:31.766 --> 05:34.290
with a detailed explanation
and you'll think I'm crazy.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.509
I already think you're crazy.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.162
Well, that's a good point.

05:37.206 --> 05:38.903
Look, I-I still have
a couple of errands to run.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.644
I'll just drop by later
and I'll tell you in person.

05:40.688 --> 05:41.906
Ciao, baby.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.172
"Ciao, baby"?

05:47.216 --> 05:48.522
Hey, Gibbs?

05:50.262 --> 05:52.395
We might not know
who left him here,

05:52.439 --> 05:54.963
but maybe Killer Korn does?

05:55.006 --> 05:56.878
Killer Korn?

05:56.921 --> 06:00.011
Killer Korn?
Killer Korn?
Like the food truck?

06:00.055 --> 06:02.187
-You know it?
-I know it? I love it.

06:02.231 --> 06:04.276
It's the best corn on the cob
in the universe.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.582
There's a sentence
you don't hear every day.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.757
Come on, Ellie, it's just corn.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.193
How good can it be?

06:08.237 --> 06:09.456
Oh, you won't be
asking me that

06:09.499 --> 06:10.892
when you try it, promise.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.023
Did I hear right?

06:12.067 --> 06:14.156
That's one
of the Killer Korn guys?

06:14.199 --> 06:15.157
Oh, now you recognize him?

06:15.200 --> 06:16.201
I didn't see the logo.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.507
Him I don't know so well.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.248
I mostly deliver to Greco,
his cousin.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.554
When was the last time
you delivered?

06:20.597 --> 06:22.773
Had to be last week.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.297
-Where do we find this place?
Well, uh, it pops up

06:25.341 --> 06:26.951
all over town.

06:26.995 --> 06:30.477
Luckily, I have my trusty
little food truck app here.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.043
Oh, yeah. Oh, of course you do.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.915
What kind of foodie
-would she be without it?
-Okay, guys.

06:33.958 --> 06:37.092
Uh, it tracks every food
truck in the metro area.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.441
Just give me a second.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.964
Retrace your steps last night.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.140
Um, my last delivery
was in Brightwood.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.577
After that, I dropped
off the truck

06:43.620 --> 06:45.361
at the supply house
around 10:00.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.450
Picked it back up
this morning at 6:30.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.756
Obviously you didn't
take inventory.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.540
Hate to say,
I'm a little lazy about that.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.542
I just let them load
the truck and I deliver.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.762
Then let's check
the supply house.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.851
Any luck on the truck, Bishop?

06:56.894 --> 06:58.069
Uh, no, not yet,

06:58.113 --> 06:59.331
which is super weird,

06:59.375 --> 07:00.681
'cause this app updates
every ten minutes,

07:00.724 --> 07:02.639
but right now it just says
that Killer Korn is...

07:02.683 --> 07:04.380
nowhere.

07:13.389 --> 07:16.174
Mmm, this is so good.

07:16.218 --> 07:19.047
You ready for this?
Listen to this sweet sound.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.659
I hate you both.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.661
Not as much
as I hate Carl over here.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.794
Hate is a strong word, Nick.

07:26.837 --> 07:30.188
Dude, this fish needs everything
except a daily walk.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.755
Are you sure neither of you
can take him?

07:31.799 --> 07:33.322
My childhood trauma, remember?

07:33.365 --> 07:34.976
Oh, come on,
that was a goldfish that died.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.499
This is a betta fish.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.762
I'll even vaccinate him. McGee?

07:38.806 --> 07:40.851
No, I'm already taking
care of Tony's fish.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.723
Maybe, uh, maybe
Gibbs will take him.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.424
Update.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.515
Petty Officer First Class
Martin Delfino,

07:52.559 --> 07:56.301
25 years old,
CO calls him a model sailor,

07:56.345 --> 07:58.042
coming off two months' leave
after back-to-back tours

07:58.086 --> 07:59.479
in the Persian Gulf.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.785
-Next of kin?
-We notified his parents
in Phoenix.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.221
They said that
he visited briefly

08:03.265 --> 08:04.527
and then returned
back to D.C. to help

08:04.571 --> 08:06.268
his cousin out
on his food truck.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.357
-We find the cousin?
Not yet. The
name is Sean Greco.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.621
We left several messages on
the number the parents gave us.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.754
Website offers no update
on that truck's location.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.016
Same with the app. Uh, I've hit

08:15.059 --> 08:17.105
the refresh button,
like, a million times

08:17.148 --> 08:18.498
and still... Oh.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.890
Wait, I don't believe it. Okay.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.544
It finally updated.
We've got a location.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.937
Good, take Torres with you.

08:22.980 --> 08:26.462
McGee, we are going
to the supply house. Let's go.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.986
All right, Killer Korn,
here we come.

08:29.030 --> 08:33.251
Hey, Nick, you are going
to love this place.

08:33.295 --> 08:36.516
They've got Taiwanese corn,
they've got Mexican street corn,

08:36.559 --> 08:39.127
they've got Cuban corn.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.695
Oh, and their
Italian corn? Mmm.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.524
Parmesan and pesto? Oh, man.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.744
Wait a minute.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.441
That's not Killer Korn.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.313
-It says "Killer Korn" on it.
-Yeah, no, I know what it says,

08:51.356 --> 08:54.664
but their truck
is green, not blue.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.667
Kosmic Korn. Not Killer Korn.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.496
It is Kosmic Korn
that's the best.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.629
Don't let Greco
hear you say that.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.065
Kosmic Korn doesn't come close.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.588
What'd I tell you?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.459
You gonna be out of here
by 3:00?

09:07.503 --> 09:10.419
As always, Bjork, but it's
my first day without Marty.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.073
He went back to the Navy,
so I'm scrambling here

09:12.116 --> 09:13.901
to open up on time.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.817
Well, uh, don't let me keep you.

09:17.861 --> 09:18.993
There's that look.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.517
Taiwanese?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.866
You know it's my favorite.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.868
Here.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.743
Enjoy!

09:29.786 --> 09:31.571
And I'll be happy
to prove our corn's

09:31.614 --> 09:34.922
a thousand times better,
just not for another half hour.

09:34.965 --> 09:38.403
Yeah, Mr. Greco, I'm afraid
we're here about your cousin.

09:40.492 --> 09:43.147
Now, that is Reilly.
He's dropping off his truck

09:43.191 --> 09:46.542
at Igloo supply house
around 10:00 p.m. last night,

09:46.586 --> 09:47.804
walking away like
nothing happened.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.023
Now, we didn't
see anyone

09:49.066 --> 09:51.634
coming or going from there
until midnight,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.810
when we see this worker
starting to load food crates

09:53.854 --> 09:55.595
just inside the freezer door.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.684
If Delfino's body
was already in there,

09:57.727 --> 10:00.904
then this guy never saw him.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.558
Well, at 6:30 a.m.,
Reilly showed up again,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.255
picked up his schedule,

10:04.299 --> 10:06.780
and headed back out, which is
exactly what he said he did.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.346
What do we know about Reilly?

10:08.390 --> 10:09.696
Two old drug
misdemeanor charges,

10:09.739 --> 10:11.088
but he's been clean
ever since then.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.307
I'm still
making calls

10:12.350 --> 10:13.961
off his delivery schedule
from yesterday.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.572
Multiple pages, you know.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.358
-That Jack's?
-Yeah.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.405
Left it to me.
A beaut, isn't she?

10:23.448 --> 10:25.799
Why, it sure does staple.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.017
Yeah.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.889
She leave you anything, boss?

10:35.939 --> 10:39.508
I-I just can't believe it.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.297
Marty was indestructible.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.735
-Like a force of nature.
-Hold up.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.172
How could he be dead?

10:51.215 --> 10:52.869
Dead?

10:52.913 --> 10:55.176
Marty? Our Marty?

10:55.219 --> 10:57.091
-I'm afraid so.
-And you are?

10:57.134 --> 10:58.440
Betty's his girlfriend.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.268
Uh, good friend.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.705
We had a friendly split
before he had to leave.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.621
Oh, God, this is awful. How?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.971
-You didn't say how he died.
-We're still trying
to figure that out.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.581
His body was discovered
in the back

11:09.625 --> 11:11.496
of a frozen food delivery truck.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.324
Seriously?

11:13.368 --> 11:16.588
The driver's name was
Richard Reilly?

11:17.764 --> 11:19.940
Are you kidding? That goofball?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.985
What was Marty doing
in his truck?

11:22.029 --> 11:23.683
Any disagreements between them?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.336
They hardly knew each other.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.861
And Reilly hadn't delivered
here in at least a week.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.427
Two weeks for me.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.952
Were there any known enemies
he might have had?

11:31.995 --> 11:34.476
No. No, he had
no enemies, but...

11:35.956 --> 11:38.262
Well, let's just say
my cousin didn't take

11:38.306 --> 11:39.699
any crap from anybody.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.396
That's a good way to say it.

11:41.439 --> 11:44.399
Such as...?From, like, people we had
to deal with sometimes.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.488
You know, business owners

11:46.531 --> 11:48.229
who don't like us parking
in front of their stores.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.058
Rude customers, food bloggers
expecting free samples

11:51.101 --> 11:53.625
in exchange for a good review.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.540
Everybody wants freebies.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.543
Parking cops,
those trendy influencers.

11:58.587 --> 12:01.198
And Marty handled
all our social media,

12:01.242 --> 12:04.288
so... he couldn't stand them.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.073
Any known arguments
or fights?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.901
I guess he had a few with Sammy.

12:07.944 --> 12:08.815
Sammy who?

12:08.858 --> 12:10.338
Sloppy Joe Sammy.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.775
Eh, I don't know
his last name,

12:12.819 --> 12:15.822
but... yeah,
those two were always at odds.

12:15.865 --> 12:16.866
Y'all know
where we can find him?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.563
That's his truck right there.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.391
Guy's a real charmer.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.526
Hey, yo, you Sammy?

12:24.569 --> 12:26.223
Did you see the name
on the side of the truck?

12:26.267 --> 12:28.530
I don't open
for another ten minutes.

12:28.573 --> 12:29.966
This won't take long.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.794
Look, I-- whoa.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.796
I'm sorry,
I was kidding.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.450
Sammy's off today.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.626
As a matter of fact,
he told me not to open at all.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.802
So have a good day.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.108
All right, hold on now.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.199
Are you trying
to flee the scene, Sammy?

12:45.242 --> 12:46.678
I told you I'm not Sammy.

12:46.722 --> 12:47.984
Turn off your engine.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.420
Turn it off?
I can't even turn it on.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.074
Stop trying.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.209
What does that badge say?

12:55.252 --> 12:56.688
NCIS.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.783
You know, food trucks make
lousy getaway cars.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.663
I told you,
for the millionth time,

13:14.706 --> 13:16.186
I thought you were
the health department.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.885
And for the millionth time,
why would you run from them?

13:20.016 --> 13:21.844
Well, if you must know,

13:21.888 --> 13:24.499
they gave my truck
a "C" rating last month,

13:24.542 --> 13:26.022
and I, I haven't
quite gotten around

13:26.066 --> 13:27.502
to making
all the improvements yet.

13:27.545 --> 13:30.374
Putting a little extra sloppy
in your sloppy joe?

13:30.418 --> 13:32.681
Yeah, even your mob buddies
would find that disgusting.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.161
Oh, here we go.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.466
What mob buddies?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.207
Found guilty in 2015
on two counts

13:37.251 --> 13:39.253
of racketeering and operating

13:39.296 --> 13:40.994
a casino without a license.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.734
The food truck business is
a bigger gamble

13:42.778 --> 13:44.954
than any backroom card game
I might have run.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.914
But that life--
it-it's all behind me now.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.568
Or at least as of two weeks ago,
when your probation ended.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.570
Oh, congratulations, what
did you do to you celebrate?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.224
Huh? You settle some scores?

13:54.268 --> 13:56.966
Hey, I got no scores
to settle with that Navy kid.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.403
Look, any problems
we might have had

13:59.447 --> 14:01.971
was because we...
we're too much alike.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.365
Is that right?
Yeah.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.541
This is a tough business.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.109
And you got to be tough
and you got to bust your ass.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.154
Nice kid like Greco's lucky

14:11.198 --> 14:12.895
to have a guy
like Marty in his corner.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.941
To fight off the competition?

14:14.984 --> 14:17.421
You want competition,
don't talk to me.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.815
Go talk to Kosmic Korn.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.599
Why, what about Kosmic Korn?

14:21.643 --> 14:23.297
Well, look, I don't know
all the gory details,

14:23.340 --> 14:26.430
but, uh, there's a lot
of bad blood over there.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.215
It's like the Hatfields
and the McCoys.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.826
You know, except for food.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.483
Sammy wasn't kidding.
These food blogs

14:35.526 --> 14:37.137
read like a crime novel.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.965
Not a good crime novel.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.271
I mean,
"The Great Korn Wars of D.C."?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.446
What's that about?

14:42.490 --> 14:44.318
Basically, both Killer
Korn and Kosmic Korn

14:44.361 --> 14:46.537
make the same product,
which apparently

14:46.581 --> 14:49.323
splits the market
on a pretty fierce fan base.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.325
Two months ago,
the competition boiled over

14:51.368 --> 14:53.283
into accusations
of slashing tires.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.894
Led to the owners
of each truck

14:54.937 --> 14:56.417
to file restraining orders
against each other.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.158
Well, where's the other truck?

14:58.201 --> 14:59.942
The website doesn't show
a location.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.726
Let me check the app again.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.860
This a bad time?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.080
Uh ...t the best, but...

15:07.123 --> 15:08.646
when has that ever stopped you?

15:08.690 --> 15:10.779
Hey, how are you?
-Hey, Tobias.
-Toby, what's up, man?

15:10.822 --> 15:13.216
-How are you?
-Greetings to one and all.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.001
I'm doing great.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.133
And I'm really glad
you all are here,

15:17.177 --> 15:19.396
because now I can
make it official.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.920
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.922
Your big news.
Gibbs...

15:22.965 --> 15:26.708
I am moving to Costa Rica.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.710
Okay.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.973
Once you told me
Sloane's original plan,

15:31.017 --> 15:32.453
you know,
before Afghanistan,

15:32.496 --> 15:34.020
the wheels started turning.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.935
So I checked it out
and I think it's really perfect.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.458
I did not know you were looking.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.460
Well, why not?
I'm on the brink of retirement.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.637
Emily is
finally squared away.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.031
The time is right.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.337
Uh... okay...

15:47.381 --> 15:49.861
squared away, okay, but...

15:49.905 --> 15:52.908
what's Emily really think
about this?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.562
My daughter thinks
it's a great idea.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.867
As a matter of fact,

15:55.911 --> 15:57.434
we're meeting
for dinner tonight

15:57.478 --> 15:59.175
to work out the details.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.655
Who knows?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.265
Maybe she'll even come with me.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.444
Well... what do you think?

16:07.488 --> 16:08.750
Me?

16:09.751 --> 16:12.101
What does that matter?

16:16.105 --> 16:18.151
It matters.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.979
You matter.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.720
Are you happy?

16:22.764 --> 16:24.418
Mm.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.246
Then, what the hell? Go for it.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.248
Yes!

16:28.291 --> 16:30.990
Nice, Tobias, way to go, man.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.600
Thanks, guys.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.645
Wow, I am really stoked.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.039
I've got
a few more errands to run,

16:37.083 --> 16:38.562
so, Gibbs, I'll give you
a call you later.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.129
And, uh...

16:40.173 --> 16:42.871
uh, everybody have a great day!

16:42.914 --> 16:43.698
-All right, man.
-See you.

16:43.741 --> 16:44.742
See you, Tobias.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.357
Wow, Costa Rica.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.446
So what do you really think,
Gibbs?

16:52.489 --> 16:54.317
You heard what I think.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.277
Yeah, but really, I mean,
first Sloane, now Fornell?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.801
Losing another friend?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.371
Did I say that out loud?

17:04.414 --> 17:06.199
Nobody's losing anything.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.157
We still got phones, right?

17:08.201 --> 17:09.941
And Zoom.
Yeah, and, uh,

17:09.985 --> 17:11.552
-FaceTime.
-Mm-hmm.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.337
Whatever-- we got a location
on those other corn trucks?

17:14.381 --> 17:16.818
Uh, you know what,
still nothing on the app.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.907
Well, get a new app
and find the damn thing.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.475
And then find out why that
kid's cousin didn't tell you

17:21.518 --> 17:24.217
about the corn wars or whatever
the hell that's about.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.094
Yeah, you did say
that out loud.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.402
That kid melted yet?

17:35.445 --> 17:37.708
Gibbs, whoa,
you scared me.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.233
Uh, yes, Petty Officer Delfino
has thawed out a bit,

17:40.276 --> 17:43.062
and his skull X-ray
is actually quite revealing.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.585
Blunt force trauma?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.282
Wait, you-you can see that?

17:46.326 --> 17:48.545
What I see is no bullet, and
that's usually when you say

17:48.589 --> 17:49.764
blunt force.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.809
I'm sorry to be
so predictable, but yes,

17:51.853 --> 17:53.898
there's a crush injury
to the squamosal suture

17:53.942 --> 17:55.726
which caused massive
brain hemorrhage.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.598
-Killed him fast.
-You know what hit him?

17:57.641 --> 17:59.861
Well, whatever it was,
it left a distinct pattern,

17:59.904 --> 18:01.863
and here comes Kasie

18:01.906 --> 18:03.691
to match that pattern
to a weapon.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.345
I'll certainly try.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.607
There's no try, Kase.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.174
You just do.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.436
Yes, sir.

18:09.479 --> 18:10.828
Oh...

18:10.872 --> 18:12.787
Wha...?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.267
Really?

18:14.310 --> 18:16.051
Gibbs actually quotes Yoda,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.140
and all you can say
is "yes, sir"?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.837
What? Oh, right.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.317
Yoda, yeah.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.537
Okay, what's going on?

18:23.580 --> 18:25.060
Is it your mom or your sister?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.322
Both.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.585
-Did Vance tell you?
-No, no.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.021
But whenever something's up
with your family,

18:30.065 --> 18:31.545
you get really quiet and...

18:31.588 --> 18:33.068
your eyebrows furrow
just like that.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.852
Damn.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.072
Nothing gets past you.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.770
Okay, last I remember, uh,
your sister lost her place,

18:39.814 --> 18:42.338
so she moved in
-with your mom, right?
-Uh, yeah.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.819
Now she's all moved in,
and it's going so well

18:44.862 --> 18:47.474
that she just called
to tell me that...

18:47.517 --> 18:50.564
Mom's having chest pains
and they're headed to the E.R.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.174
Kasie...

18:52.218 --> 18:53.958
what are you,
what are you still doing here?

18:54.002 --> 18:55.873
You know, it's...
it's not that simple.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.440
Even if I were to head
to New York now,

18:57.484 --> 19:00.182
it's not like the hospital will
allow for visitors anyway.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.053
Yeah, but you'd be closer.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.621
And Mom will definitely think
she's dying if I just show up.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.667
Yeah.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.234
Why am I burdening you
with all this?

19:08.277 --> 19:09.800
Because we're friends.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.193
Yeah, but after all
you've been through?

19:11.237 --> 19:14.588
And why have you been
through so much?

19:14.631 --> 19:17.025
Why does stuff like
this keep happening

19:17.068 --> 19:19.419
to good people like you
and, frankly, to me,

19:19.462 --> 19:21.203
while other folks are
just skating through life

19:21.247 --> 19:22.900
happily unscathed?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.859
Is that really what you think?

19:24.902 --> 19:26.469
It's what I think.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.211
And see and feel lately, yeah.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.303
Okay, all right, well, let's,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.827
let's reframe this then, um...

19:38.742 --> 19:40.048
Look, if-if what
I've been through has

19:40.091 --> 19:41.745
taught me anything, it's that

19:41.789 --> 19:44.095
absolutely no one

19:44.139 --> 19:46.837
happily skates
through life unscathed.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.404
I'm not so sure.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.276
I'm 100% sure.
It's, like, um...

19:50.319 --> 19:52.452
<i>Tale of Two Cities.</i>

19:52.495 --> 19:54.584
Okay, you lost me.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.412
Yeah, Charles Dickens
did not write

19:56.456 --> 19:58.501
"It was the best of times

19:58.545 --> 20:00.938
and everything was awesome."

20:00.982 --> 20:02.462
You know, I mean,

20:02.505 --> 20:04.768
without "the worst of times,"
we wouldn't have

20:04.812 --> 20:07.423
I don't know... poetry,

20:07.467 --> 20:10.296
wouldn't have sad songs,
wouldn't have anything

20:10.339 --> 20:12.950
that makes us appreciate
"the best of times."

20:14.778 --> 20:17.738
Stars can't shine
without darkness.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.741
No one is immune to suffering.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.309
No one.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.920
But the good news is,

20:25.963 --> 20:27.965
people like you and me?

20:28.009 --> 20:30.011
We can handle it.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.708
We can?

20:31.752 --> 20:33.493
Heck yeah.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.886
We work hard to keep shining.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.503
What?

20:46.593 --> 20:49.465
Just, now I know how you talked
that guy off the ledge.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.305
I didn't tell you
because it didn't matter.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.308
Kosmic Korn stays on their side
of town, we stay on ours.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.570
But it wasn't always that way.

21:07.614 --> 21:10.094
Hey, Greco, backup hot sauces?

21:10.138 --> 21:11.531
Right above the register, Bets.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.837
-Oh, I see them.
-What about your truck?

21:13.881 --> 21:15.665
Oh, I got a staff working it.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.406
It's cool.
We look out for each other.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.321
Some more than others.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.802
Can't afford to shut down,
not even for a day.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.021
Not in this business.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.241
Which brings us back
to your feud.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.329
How did it start?

21:29.244 --> 21:32.029
Uh...

21:32.073 --> 21:35.816
I was head line cook at Dasher's
in Georgetown for years,

21:35.859 --> 21:38.819
and then... COVID shut us down.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.996
And, uh, suddenly
out of a job,

21:42.039 --> 21:43.693
I get this corn idea.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.129
And since nobody else
was doing it,

21:45.173 --> 21:47.393
I sunk my life savings
and every credit card I had

21:47.436 --> 21:48.394
to make it happen.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.787
Struggled at first,
but then

21:50.831 --> 21:53.137
Marty came to help, and, uh,

21:53.181 --> 21:55.531
and pretty soon
business was booming.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.665
You know, until ...til Kosmic Korn.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.406
Until another cook
from Dasher's,

22:00.449 --> 22:04.366
a now <i>former</i> buddy of mine,
opened up his own truck, yeah.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.543
-Your buddy stole your idea?
-Stole my idea.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.632
My recipe.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.852
Even the Ks we use
in our name.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.942
-Oh, that's straight-up slimy.
-Well, Marty and I
thought so, too,

22:14.985 --> 22:16.378
until the restraining orders
forced us to do business

22:16.422 --> 22:18.162
miles apart.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.991
So he's out of sight,
out of mind ever since.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.037
At least until now.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.649
It's McGee.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.042
Hey, McGee, you're on speaker.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.305
Hey, one of these blogs
just gave me a location

22:30.349 --> 22:31.698
for Kosmic Korn.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.917
An industrial park
on 10th and Ardale.

22:33.961 --> 22:37.443
Uh... we're a few blocks
away from there.

22:37.486 --> 22:40.837
Hey, are you, uh,
-Pete Cannizaro?
-Uh, yeah.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.273
Just take a number
and I'll be right with you.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.449
I don't like him already.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.538
-You don't like what he did.
-And you do?

22:45.581 --> 22:47.496
I say we drag him
out by his feet

22:47.540 --> 22:48.932
for breaking his
restraining order.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.065
I say there are
other ways to get answers.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.936
Plus, you might even get
some great corn out of it.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.460
Just follow my lead.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.637
Uh, Mr. Cannizaro, we-we're
not here to eat, actually.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.857
I-I'm writing an article
for <i>Food Truck Aficionado,</i>

23:00.901 --> 23:03.599
and I'd love to feature
what we're told is

23:03.643 --> 23:04.861
the best corn in town.

23:04.905 --> 23:05.906
In the universe.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.429
But, uh,
as you can see,

23:07.473 --> 23:09.126
I'm swamped over here.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.433
Uh, well,
maybe we could help.

23:11.477 --> 23:12.391
What?

23:12.434 --> 23:13.696
Yeah, my-my husband Nick and I,

23:13.740 --> 23:15.045
we could get behind the scenes,

23:15.089 --> 23:17.047
make it
a real hands-on story.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.788
We've both been vaccinated.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.094
You have
any experience?

23:20.137 --> 23:21.400
-None.
-Tons. Nick.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.618
Well, be
honest, Ellie,

23:22.662 --> 23:24.664
we don't have tons
of experience, but...

23:24.707 --> 23:26.666
I mean, how
hard can it be?

23:27.493 --> 23:28.755
It's just corn.

23:28.798 --> 23:29.843
Oh, and you think it's easy?

23:29.886 --> 23:32.411
Okay, hotshots,
climb aboard and, uh,

23:32.454 --> 23:33.760
do exactly what I tell you.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.937
I'll take two ...need three Italian,
two Mexican,

23:36.980 --> 23:37.981
two limes and
an orange.

23:38.025 --> 23:38.982
Two limes and an orange.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.027
Three Italian, two Mexican.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.245
Uh, cancel one
of the Italians,

23:41.289 --> 23:42.464
make it a Taiwanese.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.857
Uh, okay, which one's
the Taiwanese again?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.032
It's the one with
the green label.

23:45.075 --> 23:45.989
Okay.
And after that
I need,

23:46.033 --> 23:49.384
uh, two honey butter and, uh...

23:49.428 --> 23:50.994
four Mexican.
Thank you.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.170
So, uh, how did
you get the idea

23:53.214 --> 23:55.085
to serve corn
on the cob?

23:55.129 --> 23:56.652
Uh, I don't know.

23:56.696 --> 23:59.612
Most everybody loves corn,
and nobody else was doing it.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.265
Nobody else?

24:01.309 --> 24:04.051
Well, you know, there's nothing
new under the sun, right?

24:04.094 --> 24:06.749
Right, so it was your own,
uh, killer recipe?

24:06.793 --> 24:08.708
Yeah, it's my own twist on it.
Yeah.

24:08.751 --> 24:10.753
-Uh, these are all limes.
-Oh.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.494
I need, uh ...e orange
coming right up.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.323
Hey, so, I saw this,
uh, thing online

24:15.366 --> 24:16.498
about some other corn guys,

24:16.542 --> 24:18.021
like some kind of feud
or something?

24:18.065 --> 24:19.849
Oh, it was just
a big misunderstanding.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.503
I have some regrets about that.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.463
Okay, whoa,

24:24.506 --> 24:25.464
whoa, careful,

24:25.507 --> 24:27.335
Mr. How Hard Can Corn Be?

24:27.378 --> 24:28.510
Can't have a mess in here.

24:28.554 --> 24:29.772
Nick, I'll help you.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.513
This is his first day, right?

24:32.558 --> 24:36.213
So, just
a big misunderstanding, huh?

24:36.257 --> 24:37.911
Yeah, I don't like
to talk about it.

24:37.954 --> 24:40.609
I haven't even seen those guys
since the restraining orders.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.655
Are you sure about that?

24:42.698 --> 24:43.830
Sure about what?

24:43.873 --> 24:45.396
You haven't seen
the Killer Korn guys

24:45.440 --> 24:47.050
or, uh, Marty Delfino?

24:47.094 --> 24:49.749
What does that
look like to you?

24:49.792 --> 24:51.925
That looks like blood.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.057
It's probably just hot sauce.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.102
Nope.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.191
No, it's
definitely not hot sauce.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.454
Okay, hold on, now,
I-I can explain.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.283
You're gonna have to.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.291
You think I killed Marty?

25:10.334 --> 25:12.423
Well, now that you admitted
he came to see you, I...

25:12.467 --> 25:14.948
I also think you're really bad
at wiping up blood.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.080
I keep telling you, that
was my blood from my nose.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.082
From your fight
with Marty.
It wasn't a fight.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.128
It was just an argument
that got a little physical.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.565
You whacked Marty in the head,
and then you stuffed him

25:23.609 --> 25:26.612
-into a freezer truck.
-No.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.310
In fact, once he drew blood,
he calmed down.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.225
-Even apologized.
-Is that so?

25:31.268 --> 25:33.532
Said he was trying
to break old habits.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.534
All he wanted was to make sure
his loved ones

25:35.577 --> 25:37.753
were taken care of
before he shipped out.

25:37.797 --> 25:38.928
Like his cousin?

25:38.972 --> 25:41.496
Yeah, Marty was so worried
about Greco,

25:41.540 --> 25:44.238
all that money
and mental stress,

25:44.281 --> 25:47.589
so he made one last plea to me
to get out of the corn business,

25:47.633 --> 25:50.505
and he even offered
to help finance my switch.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.767
He gave you money?

25:51.811 --> 25:53.900
I-I didn't take it.

25:53.943 --> 25:57.251
Hell, once he was done talking,
I was, you know,

25:57.294 --> 25:59.079
a little ashamed.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.995
I mean, it-it was Greco's idea
to begin with.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.126
And his recipe.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.737
Okay, I-I admit it,

26:04.780 --> 26:06.390
what I did was wrong,

26:06.434 --> 26:08.784
and life is too short, you know?

26:08.828 --> 26:12.919
Stupid "Korn War" was giving me
gray hairs of my own.

26:12.962 --> 26:15.008
So I told him
I'd switch over to burritos

26:15.051 --> 26:17.445
as soon as I ran out of corn.

26:17.488 --> 26:22.276
Kasie confirmed it's Cannizaro's
blood and not our victim, so...

26:22.319 --> 26:25.192
while it doesn't make
Cannizaro innocent,

26:25.235 --> 26:26.976
he's not lying.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.543
And once we shook on it,

26:28.587 --> 26:30.937
Marty said he had
one more stop to make.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.895
One more stop where?

26:32.939 --> 26:34.897
I don't know.

26:34.941 --> 26:38.161
All I know is he had one more
loved one to take care of.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.252
Any idea who that could be?

26:44.951 --> 26:47.431
That sounds like something
Marty would say.

26:47.475 --> 26:50.304
But I don't know that
he'd consider me a loved one.

26:50.347 --> 26:51.697
Well, you'd been his girlfriend.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.437
You said the breakup
was friendly.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.352
From my side,
at least.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.137
We were only together
for two months.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.923
He would get so protective,
so possessive.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.447
Jealous?
Of anyone in particular?

27:03.491 --> 27:04.840
Flirty customers mostly.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.407
He-He'd overhear from his truck

27:06.450 --> 27:08.539
and come over
and get in their faces.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.063
-Any fights?
-Just words.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.325
Marty was lovely.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.457
He was, uh... so sweet.

27:13.501 --> 27:16.635
It just made me feel
uncomfortable.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.593
Even if he hadn't shipped out,
I would have ended it.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.116
Life's too short.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.468
Can you think
of anyone specifically, Betty,

27:24.512 --> 27:26.514
who may have flirted recently,

27:26.557 --> 27:28.734
enough for Marty
to want to protect you?

27:28.777 --> 27:30.997
No. I can't think of...

27:32.868 --> 27:33.913
Who?

27:42.748 --> 27:44.706
Sloane gave you this?

27:44.750 --> 27:45.838
Oh. Hey, Gibbs.

27:45.881 --> 27:47.056
Yeah.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.014
I was so honored.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.493
During our talks,

27:49.537 --> 27:51.408
Sloane would always point
to the elephant in the room

27:51.452 --> 27:53.193
whenever she thought
I was holding back.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.411
What'd she leave you?

27:57.806 --> 27:59.590
Got our weapon yet?

27:59.634 --> 28:01.201
Ooh, getting there.

28:01.244 --> 28:04.508
The wound's waffling pattern
suggests a tool of some kind.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.075
Since our victim
worked with food,

28:06.119 --> 28:07.903
I am thinking
cooking tools.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.731
Like one of those
meat-tenderizing hammers

28:09.775 --> 28:11.254
or a deep fryer basket.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.082
Or maybe an actual
waffle iron.

28:13.126 --> 28:14.693
Might be a little heavy
to swing,

28:14.736 --> 28:15.955
but anything's
possible.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.565
Are you feeling better?

28:17.608 --> 28:18.958
Better than what?

28:19.001 --> 28:20.742
Well, Kase,
you seemed a little off

28:20.786 --> 28:23.049
down there in Autopsy--
you know, that...

28:23.092 --> 28:25.007
-that eyebrow thing.
-Damn. You know,

28:25.051 --> 28:27.836
I am never playing poker
with you or Jimmy.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.185
So you're not better.

28:29.229 --> 28:30.317
No.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.492
Yes.

28:31.535 --> 28:32.754
Sort of.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.321
It helped

28:34.364 --> 28:38.804
to have Jimmy remind me that
I'm not alone in my anxiety.

28:38.847 --> 28:42.155
That both joy and sadness
await us all.

28:42.198 --> 28:45.680
Good days and bad,
everybody goes through them,

28:45.724 --> 28:48.944
so, may as well embrace
the roller coaster, right?

28:52.121 --> 28:54.384
Okay, fine.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.909
Right now I'm waiting
on a call from my sister

28:56.952 --> 28:58.780
to get Mom's results
from the doctor.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.955
The way things
are going, I'm...

28:59.999 --> 29:01.914
kind of bracing for the worst.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.177
So get out of here.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.093
What? No. Like I told Jimmy ...at? Oh, no...

29:07.136 --> 29:09.095
No, no, you don't
get to say no to me.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.313
Go. Now.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.837
Fine, I will book a flight

29:11.880 --> 29:13.490
as soon as I have our weapon.

29:13.534 --> 29:14.796
Weapon can wait.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.493
Kasie.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.452
You only have one mom.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.369
The only trip you regret
is the one you don't take.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.850
So go.

29:24.893 --> 29:27.983
Get on a plane,
get on a train.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.202
Go.

29:30.246 --> 29:31.465
Oh.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.772
That might be
our weapon now.
What is it?

29:33.815 --> 29:37.123
The wound's pattern is
a 96% match

29:37.166 --> 29:38.820
to whatever this is

29:38.864 --> 29:40.691
in Bishop's
crime scene photo.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.259
That's on the
freezer truck.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.871
Hi, Bishop.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.524
We think Reilly is the guy.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.091
Yeah, I know that.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.701
Hey, you go. Go.

29:50.745 --> 29:51.877
Where is he?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.182
Now.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.099
I admit, Marty did come see me
last night,

29:57.143 --> 29:58.666
but it's a long story.

29:58.709 --> 29:59.972
We've got time.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.495
Make it a good one.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.540
I was on my last stop
at this snack shop

30:03.584 --> 30:06.369
when Marty comes up to me
and tells me to stay away

30:06.413 --> 30:09.024
from this girlfriend of his
while he was away at sea.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.286
Beignet Betty.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.288
That one, yeah.
I wanted to reassure the guy

30:12.332 --> 30:15.204
he had nothing to worry about,
only I had parked by a hydrant

30:15.248 --> 30:17.990
and was in a hurry,
so I asked him to wait outside

30:18.033 --> 30:20.383
while I finished up my delivery.

30:20.427 --> 30:24.518
But when I came back out,
he was nowhere in sight. Gone.

30:24.561 --> 30:25.867
Rule 39.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.434
-What's that?
-Convenient.

30:27.477 --> 30:30.524
Maybe so, but...
it was also a big relief.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.701
So I-I closed up my truck,
I snatched the ticket off my...

30:33.744 --> 30:36.095
my-my windshield,
and I drove off fast.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.879
You should have told us that
this morning.
Look,

30:37.923 --> 30:38.924
I panicked, okay?

30:38.967 --> 30:40.577
So I played dumb.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.231
Oh, you don't got
to play dumb.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.842
Found a couple of hairs.

30:43.885 --> 30:45.974
You all want to bet
they belong to Marty?

30:46.018 --> 30:48.542
I swear to you,
I did not kill him.

30:48.585 --> 30:50.196
Wait. Back up.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.719
You got a parking ticket?

30:52.763 --> 30:54.896
It-it was 75 bucks. But...

30:54.940 --> 30:57.594
I wasn't even mad,
since Marty had left.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.987
Again, I was
by a hydrant,

30:59.031 --> 31:00.902
so it wasn't a
complete surprise.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
Ticket issued by C. Bjork.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.166
I'll run the badge number.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.776
Of course. Bjork strikes again.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.604
-You know him?
-Every truck driver does.

31:07.648 --> 31:09.955
Must have nailed me five
times already this year.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.827
And he's an even bigger hard-ass
with food trucks.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.089
Yeah, we know him, too, Nick.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.178
-We do?
-He got free corn from Greco.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.876
-Let's go get him.
Hang on.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.965
We're gonna need surveillance
from where this all happened.

31:20.008 --> 31:22.489
-Got the address on the ticket.
-You're coming with me.

31:22.532 --> 31:25.535
-Where am I going?
-You're going with me until we
find out you're not lying again.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.887
Hold this.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.584
Hey, Tobias,
can I call you back?

31:30.627 --> 31:32.281
I'm in the middle of something.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.979
Gibbs, hurry. It-It's Emily.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.589
Wait, what? What's going on?

31:35.632 --> 31:38.070
-Oh, my God. It's Emily.
-Tobias!

31:38.113 --> 31:39.549
Gibbs?

31:50.256 --> 31:51.213
Tobias.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.867
They won't let me in, Gibbs.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.695
My baby's in there and
they won't let me in.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.436
-Why won't they let me in?
-Okay, let's sit down.

31:56.479 --> 31:57.959
I don't want to sit down.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.918
Okay. Take a breath.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.921
Talk to me. Tell
me what happened.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.009
I don't know.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.488
First she didn't
show up for dinner

32:05.532 --> 32:07.621
and then she didn't
answer my texts or...

32:07.664 --> 32:10.406
or any of my...
my calls,

32:10.450 --> 32:12.234
and then I-I ran
home, and I...

32:12.278 --> 32:14.367
I went to her room,
and there she was.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.891
Bottle of pills
on her nightstand.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.285
She's alive.
Barely.

32:19.328 --> 32:24.159
She was breathing, but she was
so cold, her skin was so cold.

32:24.203 --> 32:26.248
What do we do, Gibbs?
What are we gonna do?

32:26.292 --> 32:28.947
We're gonna sit down.

32:32.820 --> 32:33.995
And we're gonna
let these doctors do

32:34.039 --> 32:37.694
what it is they do best.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.348
All right.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.961
Right, there's
good doctors here.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.963
Yeah, they're the best.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.399
Sit down.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.106
She's gonna be okay.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.978
Believe that.

33:11.337 --> 33:14.253
Yeah, that's one of mine.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.081
I didn't see the guy
I ticketed, though.

33:16.124 --> 33:19.214
But you saw, uh,
Marty Delfino.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.564
We have a witness
that saw you guys arguing.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.088
Wait, Marty?

33:23.131 --> 33:26.874
From the corn truck?
I-I'm confused.

33:26.917 --> 33:30.138
No, no, you're not,
and yes, that Marty.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.574
You got into a scuffle.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.576
Not a scuffle.

33:33.620 --> 33:37.232
A-After I wrote his ticket,
he just sort of appeared,

33:37.276 --> 33:40.366
told me to stop being
such a hard-ass.

33:40.409 --> 33:41.671
And then he just
kind of tripped.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.021
Oh, he didn't trip.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.806
Our witness saw you

33:45.849 --> 33:49.592
pushing him headfirst, hard,
into a truck.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.594
I'm telling you, he stumbled.

33:51.638 --> 33:54.293
And yeah, he-he landed
kind of hard, y-you know,

33:54.336 --> 33:56.208
so I set him up in the truck

33:56.251 --> 33:59.080
wh-while I went to go get
the first aid kit from my car.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.648
So you left the scene
and came back?

34:01.691 --> 34:04.868
And when I did, he was gone.
Did your witness see that?

34:04.912 --> 34:06.261
Oh, I'm sorry,
I keep saying "witness."

34:06.305 --> 34:09.699
I meant to say "security video."

34:11.875 --> 34:13.921
We have the whole thing, Bjork,

34:13.964 --> 34:15.792
in living color.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.630
I-I snapped, okay?

34:27.674 --> 34:31.069
The guy got in my face
and I let him have it.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.984
But, again,
I only put him in the truck

34:34.028 --> 34:35.812
so he could sit and ice his head

34:35.856 --> 34:37.988
while I went to go get
first aid.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.599
Video doesn't lie.

34:39.642 --> 34:41.470
Marty was half-dead
when you put him in the truck.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.864
You were hoping to pin it
on Reilly.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.519
Then you left
and never came back.

34:48.651 --> 34:52.002
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

34:52.046 --> 34:55.658
having everybody
mad at you every day

34:55.702 --> 34:57.573
just for doing your job?

35:00.489 --> 35:02.317
I'd let Gibbs know, but...

35:02.361 --> 35:03.797
Still going straight
to voice mail?

35:03.840 --> 35:04.885
Yep.

35:04.928 --> 35:07.105
Well, he clearly said "Tobias"

35:07.148 --> 35:08.584
when he answered the phone,

35:08.628 --> 35:10.847
and then he just
ran off without a word.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.936
I shudder to think what those
two are up to right now.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.852
-I'm gonna try him again.
-Hmm.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.431
Sylvia Carruthers.

35:31.825 --> 35:34.044
Who?

35:34.088 --> 35:35.959
The name on the
prescription bottle.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.831
Grandmother of one
of Em's friends.

35:37.874 --> 35:41.400
She probably found it in the
old lady's medicine cabinet.

35:41.443 --> 35:45.447
Temptation is everywhere,
Tobias.

35:45.491 --> 35:49.190
I really thought she
was past it, Gibbs.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.715
Seemed... completely okay.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.848
She was.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.242
She will be again.

36:29.796 --> 36:33.103
Hey, we deserve a good cry.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.105
Oh, hey.

36:35.149 --> 36:37.543
Jimmy just walked in.
Let me call you back.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.849
Okay. Love you, too.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.852
You were right.
You were so right.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.245
I was? I am?

36:44.289 --> 36:45.942
That was my sister.

36:45.986 --> 36:49.468
My mom passed all her tests
with flying colors.

36:49.511 --> 36:52.427
See? That is great.

36:52.471 --> 36:54.255
And while they were
at the hospital,

36:54.299 --> 36:56.039
my sister's old job called.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.607
They want her back
starting next week.

36:58.651 --> 36:59.695
This is, this is great.

36:59.739 --> 37:00.914
Oh, hey.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.307
It's Mom. I-- Let me take this.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.656
Yeah, t-take it. I-I...

37:03.699 --> 37:04.787
Give her my best.

37:04.831 --> 37:07.312
Hey. Hey, Mom.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.966
Yeah, uh, hang on. Hey, Jimmy.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.187
Thank you.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.763
Oh, yeah.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.591
That's right.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.288
What's right?

37:29.334 --> 37:31.814
She was there, in the room.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.207
Emily?

37:34.252 --> 37:35.340
Diane.

37:35.383 --> 37:39.169
Her mother.
Her spirit.

37:39.213 --> 37:42.216
When I first ran in
and saw Emily in the bed,

37:42.260 --> 37:45.263
I could feel Diane in the room,

37:45.306 --> 37:47.352
like she was waiting
for me to get there.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.444
Yeah, I'll bet she was.

37:52.487 --> 37:55.708
Yeah. I'm sure of it.

37:55.751 --> 37:58.406
Yeah, good.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.278
Then Emily was not alone.

38:36.662 --> 38:40.622
Hey, guys, I just finished up,
so I am headed o...

38:43.886 --> 38:44.887
What's going on? What happened?

38:44.931 --> 38:46.236
Emily Fornell.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.803
What?

38:49.849 --> 38:51.720
How? H-How?

38:51.764 --> 38:54.462
-Addiction.
You know how it goes.

38:54.506 --> 38:57.335
Addicts build up a tolerance.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.120
They get clean.

39:00.163 --> 39:03.253
Sometimes they relapse, and
it's a shock to their system.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.429
You know?

39:05.473 --> 39:07.388
Just doesn't seem real.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.608
I'm gonna go home
and hug my kids.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.394
Director.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.135
I guess you heard?

39:15.178 --> 39:20.183
Gibbs is, uh... he's taking
Fornell to his place.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.490
Um...

39:22.534 --> 39:26.364
I thought I would just go over
and, I don't know,

39:26.407 --> 39:30.542
I don't know, just sit outside
and just be there.

39:30.585 --> 39:33.414
That sounds nice.
I, uh, think I'll join you.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.546
I'll join, too.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.505
What do you have there,

39:37.549 --> 39:40.334
Director?

39:40.378 --> 39:44.164
It's a, it's a copy
of a poem that...

39:44.207 --> 39:46.209
a friend sent me
when my wife died.

39:46.253 --> 39:49.387
The same one you sent me?
Merrit Malloy?

39:49.430 --> 39:53.739
Yeah. I thought I would
give it to Fornell.

39:53.782 --> 39:55.480
I don't know,
it might be too soon.

39:55.523 --> 39:59.266
It's never too soon, sir.
Not for that poem.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.791
I'd like to read it.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.010
Or hear it.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.318
Sure.

40:15.543 --> 40:18.241
I'll try to get through it.

40:20.983 --> 40:24.117
"When I die

40:24.160 --> 40:27.033
"Give what's left of me away

40:27.076 --> 40:29.035
"To children

40:29.078 --> 40:31.690
And old men that wait to die."

40:34.997 --> 40:36.695
<i>"And if you need to cry..."</i>

40:38.174 --> 40:40.699
<i>"Cry for your brother or sister</i>

40:40.742 --> 40:43.179
<i>Who walk the street beside you."</i>

40:47.270 --> 40:49.577
<i>"And when you need me,</i>

40:49.621 --> 40:52.145
<i>Put your arms around anyone..."</i>

40:56.149 --> 40:59.761
<i>"And give them
what you need to give to me."</i>

41:09.249 --> 41:12.557
<i>"I want to leave you something.</i>

41:12.600 --> 41:15.516
<i>"Something better than words</i>

41:15.560 --> 41:18.214
<i>"Or sounds.</i>

41:18.258 --> 41:20.521
<i>"Look for me</i>

41:20.565 --> 41:23.698
<i>In the people
I've known or loved."</i>

41:29.443 --> 41:32.838
<i>"And if you cannot give me away,</i>

41:32.881 --> 41:36.406
<i>"At least let me live
in your eyes</i>

41:36.450 --> 41:38.060
<i>And not your mind."</i>

41:53.075 --> 41:55.382
<i>"You can love me most</i>

41:55.425 --> 41:58.037
<i>By letting hands touch hands."</i>

42:00.387 --> 42:02.781
<i>"By letting bodies touch
bodies."</i>

42:06.349 --> 42:08.308
<i>"And by letting go</i>

42:08.351 --> 42:10.745
<i>"Of children</i>

42:10.789 --> 42:12.617
<i>That need to be free."</i>

42:20.233 --> 42:23.671
<i>"Love doesn't die.</i>

42:23.715 --> 42:25.368
<i>People do."</i>

42:29.285 --> 42:33.376
<i>"So, when all that's
left of me is love..."</i>

42:37.772 --> 42:39.774
<i>"Give me away."</i>
