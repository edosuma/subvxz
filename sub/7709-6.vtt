00:00.801 --> 00:06.006
*

00:36.704 --> 00:37.671
(woman on speaker phone)
Are you listening
to me, Michael?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.373
Affirmative.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.542
What did I just say?

00:41.575 --> 00:44.345
You just said--
Let me, uh...

00:44.378 --> 00:45.479
check my notes.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.680
You just said...

00:46.714 --> 00:49.517
Alan and I have created
an incentive program--

00:49.550 --> 00:51.419
Hey!
Hey, how is Alan?

00:51.452 --> 00:55.223
Tell Alan that the Mets suck.
Okay?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.591
From me, big time.
Go Pirates!

00:57.625 --> 00:59.393
Not gonna do that,
Michael.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.129
We've created an incentive
program to increase sales.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.496
Uh-huh.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.732
At the end of the month,
you can reward your top seller

01:04.765 --> 01:06.400
with a prize worth
up to $1,000.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.635
Whoa, howdy ho.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.503
Wow, 1,000 big ones.
That's cool.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.505
Do I, uh, do I get
to pick the prize?

01:11.539 --> 01:13.407
Uh...yes.
Yes, you can.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.842
Um, question:

01:14.875 --> 01:18.846
Does "top salesman" include
people who were at one time

01:18.879 --> 01:23.384
such outstanding salesmen
that they've been promoted to--

01:23.417 --> 01:24.318
No, Michael.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.820
No, you can't
win this prize.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.756
I didn't mean me.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.397
Well, first
what we have to do

01:36.430 --> 01:39.467
is find out what motivates
people more than anything else.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.501
Sex.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.502
It's illegal.
I can't do that.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.503
Next best thing.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.504
Torture.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.505
Come on, Dwight.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.506
Just help me out here.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.540
That's stupid.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.541
Um, Michael--

01:47.575 --> 01:48.476
Pam!

01:48.509 --> 01:50.211
Hey, there's--
Burger with cheese!

01:50.244 --> 01:51.745
There's a person here--
And fries!

01:51.779 --> 01:52.913
There's--
And shake!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.515
What?
Go ahead.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.450
There's a person here
who wants to sell handbags.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.885
No, no, no.
No vendors in the office.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.420
That is a distraction.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.155
Okay, I told her you'd
talk to her at least--

02:01.189 --> 02:02.390
Pam, come on, I'm busy.

02:02.423 --> 02:03.691
So just
tell her to go away.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.293
Okay.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.329
[sigh]

02:10.831 --> 02:13.367
All right,
I'll talk to her.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.335
This one is hand-embroidered.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.669
All right, girls,
break it up.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.405
You're being infiltrated.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.539
Cock in the henhouse.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.274
Cocks in the henhouse.
Don't say cocks.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.809
Oh! Ahem!

02:21.842 --> 02:24.945
[Irish accent]
What is your name,
my fair lass?

02:24.978 --> 02:25.946
Katy.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.617
Ah, Katy.
Wow, look at you!

02:29.650 --> 02:32.553
You are, uh, you're like
the new and improved Pam.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.954
Pam 6.0.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.756
[laughing]
Ohh, look!

02:35.789 --> 02:38.559
Oh, hey, no cat fights,
you two.

02:38.592 --> 02:39.860
I'm against violence
in the workplace.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.495
So am I.
Nobody cares
what you think.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.563
Doesn't matter.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.897
So, uh,
you know what?

02:43.931 --> 02:46.567
I usually don't allow
solicitors in the office.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.603
But today, I am going
to break some rules.

02:49.637 --> 02:50.838
And you can
have the conference room.

02:50.871 --> 02:51.872
It's yours,
all day.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.307
Wow, thanks.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.409
There's an HR meeting
in there at 11:30.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.811
Well, let's put them
in the hallway.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.513
We'll give them
some chairs.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.615
Right?
Decisiveness!

03:01.649 --> 03:02.950
One of the keys
to success,

03:02.983 --> 03:04.985
according
to Small Businessman.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.421
I do, I read
Small Businessman.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.958
I also subscribe
to USA Today,

03:10.991 --> 03:14.262
and American Way,
um, magazine.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.496
That's the in-flight
magazine.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.531
Some great articles
in that.

03:17.565 --> 03:21.502
They did this great
profile last month

03:21.535 --> 03:24.272
of Doris Roberts,

03:24.305 --> 03:27.341
and where she likes to eat
when she's in Phoenix.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.310
Illuminating.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.778
This is my conference room.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.381
So please, uh,
make yourself at home.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.515
Whatever you need,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.617
I'm right on the other side
of this wall.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.386
Used to be a window here.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.920
There's not anymore.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.255
So that's
where I will be.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.624
So, ahem...

03:43.657 --> 03:45.025
If you need anything else,

03:45.058 --> 03:46.527
something to make you
more comfortable...

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
Just don't hesitate
to ask.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.664
I'm right here.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.566
I guess a cup of coffee
would be great.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.935
Wait a second!

03:54.968 --> 03:58.038
Ah! I should have spotted
another addict.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.607
Oh, gotta love
the 'Bucks!

03:59.640 --> 04:00.974
What?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.343
It's like a slang
for Starbucks.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.444
They're all over
the place.

04:03.477 --> 04:07.381
Oh, man, that place is like
the promised land to me.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.350
What a business model too.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.852
Oh, too bad we don't
have the good stuff here.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.587
Regular coffee is fine.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.623
No, it's not, it's--

04:15.656 --> 04:16.857
No, really, it is.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.359
No, here's the thing.

04:18.392 --> 04:23.531
You know,
I do my best to--

04:23.564 --> 04:26.567
to be my own man,
and, uh...

04:26.600 --> 04:29.737
go by the beat
of a different drummer.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.572
And nobody gets me.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.341
And they're always
putting up walls,

04:33.374 --> 04:34.742
and I'm always
tearing them down.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.711
Just breaking down barriers.
That's what I do all day.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.651
So...a coffee.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.719
Regular coffee.
For you.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.721
High test or unleaded?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.890
Bring it on.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.525
Ooh, ho!
Whoo!

04:51.559 --> 04:53.761
I will, I'll bring it on!
All right!

04:55.763 --> 04:58.499
So...are you jealous

04:58.532 --> 05:00.501
'cause there's
another girl around?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.636
No.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.705
She's prettier than you,
though.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.479
That's a very rude
thing to say, Kevin.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.819
So you like the periwinkles
and the purples?

05:18.852 --> 05:21.755
(Dwight)
The purse girl hits
everything on my checklist.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.792
Creamy skin,
straight teeth,

05:24.825 --> 05:28.662
curly hair,
amazing breasts--

05:28.696 --> 05:30.664
not for me,
for my children.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.033
The Schrutes produce
very thirsty babies.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.101
There you go!

05:34.134 --> 05:36.069
Nice, steaming hot
cup of Joe.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.971
Thank you.
I have an idea.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.907
Why don't
I introduce you around?

05:39.940 --> 05:42.510
You know, you can kind of
get your foot in the door,

05:42.543 --> 05:43.811
meet potential
clientele, right?

05:43.844 --> 05:46.079
Gosh, I'm--
I would love to,

05:46.113 --> 05:47.948
but my purses,
I should, um--

05:47.981 --> 05:50.484
Oh, um, well,
we can have Ryan take a look.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.919
Ryan, would you look
after the purses, please?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.921
Uh, I'm installing File Share
on all the computers.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.656
Yeah, well, blah
dee blooh dah blah blah.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.624
Techno babble.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.159
Just do it, okay?
We have company, right?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.694
You should sell
a lot here,

06:00.728 --> 06:03.631
because this branch made
over $1 million last year.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.765
Not that we're
all millionaires.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.834
I'm probably closest,
so...

06:06.867 --> 06:09.703
Here's Oscar!
Oscar, this is Katy.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.771
I'm on the phone.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.573
Ooh, ooh, oh,
Oscar the Grouch.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.542
Right?
I thought of that.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.510
That was
on Sesame Street.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.711
I know, I know, I know.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.812
I made the connection.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.514
Can you believe
he'd never heard that

06:20.548 --> 06:21.749
before he worked here?

06:21.782 --> 06:22.983
No, I don't
believe that.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.852
I know,
it's unbelievable.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.120
It's nice
having Katy around.

06:27.154 --> 06:31.425
It's another person
for Michael to, um...

06:31.459 --> 06:33.794
interact with.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.796
Here is Toby
from Human Resources.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.097
Katy, Toby.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.799
Toby, Katy!
Hi, nice to meet you.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.868
Did you go
to Bishop O'Hara?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.736
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.037
Cool.
What year were you there?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.573
'89.
Toby's divorced.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.475
He, uh...God.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.842
Recently, right?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.110
Yeah.
You and your wife?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.079
And you have kids?
A girl.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.481
Oh, that's so...

06:53.514 --> 06:55.215
That was really messy.

06:55.248 --> 06:59.753
He slept one night
in your car too?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.889
I should probably
get back to my table.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.090
Okay, all right.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.192
Cool.
See you in a bit.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.063
Oh!
Hey, she's cute.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.866
Cutie pie.
Back to work!

07:12.900 --> 07:14.802
I live by one rule.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.170
No office romances,
no way.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.708
Very messy,
inappropriate.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.875
No.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.511
But...

07:23.544 --> 07:25.879
I live by another rule.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.114
Just do it.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.816
Nike.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.651
Hey, Jimmy,
what do you think

07:30.684 --> 07:32.686
about that little
purse girl, huh?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.488
Cute, sure, yeah.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
Why don't you
get on that?

07:35.989 --> 07:37.858
She's not really my type.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.727
What, are you gay?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.596
Mmm, I don't
think so, no.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.097
(Kevin)
Well, what
is your type?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.869
Moms...primarily.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.805
Yep, soccer moms,
single moms, NASCAR moms.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.006
Any type of mom, really.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.608
That's disgusting.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.076
(Kevin)
Stay away from my mom.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.611
Too late, Kev.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.216
[Roy sighs]

08:03.250 --> 08:07.054
Man, I would be all over that
if I wasn't dating Pam.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.290
We're not dating,
we're engaged.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.660
Engaged, yeah.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.841
(Jim)
Pam and I are good buddies.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.142
I'm sort of Pam's
go-to guy

08:29.176 --> 08:30.878
for her problems.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.113
You know,
with stuff like work

08:33.146 --> 08:35.683
or, uh, her fiancé Roy.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.051
Or, um...

08:38.085 --> 08:41.288
Nope, those are pretty much
her only two problems.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.623
(Jim)
She'd be perfect
for you.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.423
(Dwight)
Mmm.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.759
She's been talking
to Michael a lot.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.827
So what?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.662
You're Assistant
Regional Manager.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.930
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.

08:49.963 --> 08:50.998
Well, you know what,
Dwight?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.733
He's your work boss, okay?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.134
He is not
your relationship boss.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.135
That's true.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.637
Plus, you have
so much more

08:56.670 --> 08:57.871
to talk
to this girl about.

08:57.905 --> 09:01.742
You're both, um, salesmen.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.043
I mean, that's something
right there.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.111
True.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.679
Plus, I could talk to her

09:05.713 --> 09:07.848
about the origins
of my last name.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.917
It's all gold.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.286
Guys are usually
my best customers.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.855
They buy
the high-end stuff,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.724
like the beads
and the sequins and stuff,

09:16.757 --> 09:18.859
for gifts, you know.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.993
They don't know
what they're looking at,

09:20.027 --> 09:22.329
so I make suggestions.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.864
All right,
here's the thing, okay?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.699
You just
keep talking to her.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.300
If you hit a stall,
you have a perfect fallback.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.836
What's that?
You buy a purse.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.838
I don't want a purse.
Purses are for girls.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.272
Dwight, that's not
necessarily true.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.774
Do you read GQ?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.075
No.
Okay, I do.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.877
They're like mini briefcases,
all right?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.345
Lots of guys have them.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.113
Like those?
Yes!

09:40.147 --> 09:41.915
Listen, you are spending
way too much time

09:41.949 --> 09:43.884
talking to me when
you could be talking to her.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.352
Okay, I'm just gonna
use the bathroom and then--

09:45.385 --> 09:46.854
No, you don't
need the bathroom.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.022
You've got it.
Go.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.727
[whispering]
Okay, shh. Stop.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.862
Stop whatever
you're doing,

09:54.895 --> 09:57.731
'cause this
is going to be good.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.933
(Jim)
[high voice mimicking]
Hi, my name is Dwight Schrute,

09:59.967 --> 10:02.035
and I would like
to buy a purse from you.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.337
Good Lord,
look at these purses!

10:04.371 --> 10:06.707
This is something special.

10:06.740 --> 10:12.045
Oh, my God, is this
Salvatore Dacinni purse?

10:12.079 --> 10:14.915
Oh, definitely--definitely
step in and out of it like that.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.217
(Jim)
Yes, well, I want
to stress test it.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.285
You know,

10:18.318 --> 10:19.953
in case anything happens.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.955
Oh!
Oh!

10:21.989 --> 10:24.224
[laughing]
That was really--

10:24.257 --> 10:25.993
This is necessary to do

10:26.026 --> 10:27.861
to really give it
a good workout.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.930
This is the--ooh.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.799
This is the prettiest
one of all.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.802
I'm gonna be the prettiest
girl in the ball.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.236
Oh, how much?

10:36.269 --> 10:38.338
Oh, God, it's sad.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.840
It's so sad.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.275
Here he comes, shh.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.348
[giggling]

10:48.381 --> 10:49.817
He did pick
a good one.

10:49.850 --> 10:50.918
You're horrible.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.986
This one's really good
for a hot date.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.854
Yeah, what's that?

10:53.887 --> 10:54.888
[both laugh]

10:54.922 --> 10:56.189
I'm engaged.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.024
Oh, congratulations.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.992
You need a hot date
more than anyone.

10:59.026 --> 10:59.827
Oh, I wish, right?

10:59.860 --> 11:02.295
Giggle, giggle,
shooshy, shooshy.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.630
I get it, I get it.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.933
Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood over here.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.134
Right?

11:07.167 --> 11:10.237
So, how was that coffee
from earlier?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.371
Good.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.873
Ah, I knew it.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.176
Guzzled it down.
You greedy little thing.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.179
So, uh, Pam,
is this your lunch break

11:19.212 --> 11:20.981
or was that earlier,

11:21.014 --> 11:26.053
when you were eating
in the kitchen with those guys?

11:26.086 --> 11:27.888
[gasps]
Sorry.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.022
Busted.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.323
[laughs]

11:30.357 --> 11:31.424
Come back?
Oh, hey!

11:31.458 --> 11:32.325
I wanna show you something.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.927
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.996
I know you
are gonna like this.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.031
Picked it up today.
1,000 big ones.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.399
Is that from Starbucks?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.335
Yes, this is a Starbucks
Digital Barista.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.938
This is the mack daddy
of espresso makers.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.807
Wow, is that
for the office?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.308
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.043
Ooh, you're not prying this
out of my hands.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.912
[laughs]

11:51.945 --> 11:53.446
But don't tempt me,
'cause I'll give it to you.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.816
I wouldn't think of it.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.819
Coffee is the great
"incentivizer" in the office.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.488
It's a drug--
it is quite literally a drug

12:01.521 --> 12:03.924
that speeds people up.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.993
It's not the only drug
that speeds people up.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.830
You hear stories about
Dunder Mifflin in the '80s

12:09.863 --> 12:12.165
before everybody knew
how bad cocaine was.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.202
Gah--man,
did they move paper!

12:15.235 --> 12:21.775
Oh, the rotating, uh,
steam...wand.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.276
What?
What's the matter?

12:23.310 --> 12:26.046
Oh, nothing.
My ride just bailed on me.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.215
Oh, oh, God, I'm sorry.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.416
Is it--
Oh, no, it's--

12:29.449 --> 12:30.784
Where you going?
Nearby?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.052
Because I could
give you a ride.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.253
No.
Sure?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.355
I don't wanna
inconvenience you.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.090
No, no, no, no, no!
No inconvenience.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.892
I mean, I'm out of here
at 5:00 sharp.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.061
At 5:00?
I can go earlier,
'cause I'm the boss.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.932
You know, whatever.
I'm outta here...slaves.
Okay.

12:44.965 --> 12:45.966
What?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.301
Okay.
Okay!

12:48.335 --> 12:50.804
I guess that would be--
I guess that would be okay.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.539
Okay, sounds good,
sounds good.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.408
5:00 sharp, I will give
you and your purses a ride home.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.977
Okay, cool.

12:57.010 --> 12:57.978
Right! Great!

12:58.011 --> 12:59.112
Cool.
Cool!

12:59.146 --> 13:01.014
Cool!

13:04.017 --> 13:06.319
Nyah, okay.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.489
I should never have
let the temp touch this thing.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.193
I had all these great icons,
and now I have four folders.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.228
It's actually
better this way.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.897
No, it's not,
because I could just

13:16.930 --> 13:19.166
click on the icon
and then I'm onto something--

13:19.199 --> 13:20.500
Michael, could I
ask you something?

13:20.533 --> 13:23.236
I wanted to ask your permission
to ask out Katy.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.105
I know it's against
the rules and everything--

13:25.138 --> 13:26.606
No, no, no, it's not
against the rules.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.176
Ahem. She is not
a permanent employee,

13:29.209 --> 13:30.143
so it's not.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.145
Thank you, Michael.
I appreciate this so much.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.546
But I think
you should just know

13:33.580 --> 13:37.250
that I am going to be
giving her a ride home later.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.952
What?

13:38.986 --> 13:40.120
She asked me for a ride,

13:40.153 --> 13:42.389
and so I'm going
to give her a ride home.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.957
Is that all it is?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.325
Just a ride home?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.027
Like a taxi cab?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.529
Well, it might
be a ride home.

13:49.562 --> 13:54.267
Might be a ride home,
and we stop for coffee and...

13:54.301 --> 13:55.602
dot, dot, dot.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.908
Please...please...

14:00.941 --> 14:02.209
I am your inferior,

14:02.242 --> 14:03.944
and I'm asking you
this favor.

14:03.977 --> 14:07.614
Can you promise me that
it will just be a ride home?

14:11.418 --> 14:13.286
No.
I cannot promise.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.488
You cannot promise me
or you won't promise me?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.490
Listen, Dwight--

14:17.524 --> 14:18.892
Do you love her?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.027
[scoffs]
Dwight, no.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.429
I--I don't know.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.064
It's too early to tell.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.134
I--I don't know
how I feel.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.007
I think you've made
a really good choice.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.008
She's really
gonna like that.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.910
Hmm.
Espresso?

14:36.944 --> 14:38.011
Oh, thank you.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.412
You're welcome.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.547
Thank you.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.015
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.016
Mmm!

14:43.050 --> 14:45.285
Is that from the machine
that was in your office?

14:45.318 --> 14:46.920
Mm-hmm.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.288
I thought that
was the incentive prize

14:48.321 --> 14:49.422
for the top sales person.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.024
Very easy to clean.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.625
Okay.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.062
Like he's gonna
win anyway.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.997
[snickers]
Right?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.104
So did we get any mail?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.705
Yeah, I gave it to you.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.574
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.077
Just checking.
Just checking, double checking.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.144
Checking on the check.

15:11.178 --> 15:15.415
Thoroughness is very
important in an office, and--

15:15.448 --> 15:16.549
So can I--

15:16.583 --> 15:17.617
Yeah, yeah.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.952
Of course.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.220
Uh, Pam, one more thing.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.522
Um, how do girls your age
feel about futons?

15:24.191 --> 15:25.292
A futon?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.060
He's a grown man.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.428
That's what he said.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.197
That's sad.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.264
Or it's innovative.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.399
Well, you know,
the futon

15:32.432 --> 15:35.502
is a bed and couch
all rolled into one.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.503
What's up?

15:36.536 --> 15:38.638
Hi.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.573
Are you still
mad at me?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.641
Roy...

15:41.674 --> 15:42.976
Come on.
Cut it out.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.144
Come on,
are you mad at me?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.079
Stop it!
Are you still
mad at me now?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.447
Cut it out.
Are you mad at me now?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.515
[laughing]
Stop!
Huh?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.617
[laughing]
Huh?
Come on.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.086
Come on, Pammy.
Stop, I can't breathe.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.687
I was just kidding.
You know I didn't mean it.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.089
[Pam laughing]

15:56.123 --> 15:57.057
(Pam)
Jim's a great guy.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.525
He's like a brother to me.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.693
We're, like,
best friends in the office.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.997
And I really hope
he finds someone.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.033
You seem to like
to touch things.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.400
You should
try the velvet.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.103
I don't like
to necessarily touch things.

16:10.137 --> 16:13.140
I'm just--
I'm shopping.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.576
Oh, no,
it's fine that you--

16:16.609 --> 16:19.112
Here, what about
the raspberry one?

16:19.146 --> 16:21.714
It's really, um,
kind of festive.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.550
It's got a lot
of personality.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.185
Hey, how's it going?
Fine.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.120
Good, could I talk to you
for a second, in private?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.189
I don't think so.
I'm really busy.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.157
It'll just take a second.
I can't.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.724
Just for a minute.
Please?
I really can't.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.626
I wanted to talk to you
in private because

16:33.660 --> 16:37.097
I wanted to ask you
out on a date.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.431
No.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.109
Okay, was that "no"
to talking to me in private

16:49.142 --> 16:51.344
or was that "no" to the date?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.213
Both.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.520
What colors
do you like?

17:00.553 --> 17:04.324
(woman)
Gray, dark gray, charcoal.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.260
Brian...
Yeah?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.296
Would you like to help me
with a special project?

17:09.329 --> 17:11.198
I would love to.
Well, all right.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.234
Okay, just throw out
all the empties.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.302
You don't want
to recycle them?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.570
Um...yes.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.773
Throw them away
in the recycling bin.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.542
Do you want this?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.579
No.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.315
What about this bottle
of power drink?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.416
Uh, what flavor?

17:29.449 --> 17:30.450
Blue.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.484
Blue's not a flavor.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.186
It says,
"Flavor: Blue Blast."

17:33.220 --> 17:35.188
Oh, Blue Blast, yes.
Put that in the trunk.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.557
And there should be an unopened
Arctic Chill back there.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.626
I want that
in the passenger's cup holder.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.161
Thank you.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.205
Hi.
Hi.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.673
I'm Jim, by the way.
I'm Katy.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.175
Hi, Katy,
nice to meet you.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.309
You sit out there,
don't you?
I do.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.344
That's what
I'm best known for.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.279
[laughs]
Sitting out there.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.348
All right,
let's talk about purses.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.615
Okay, um--

18:02.649 --> 18:04.217
Katy, but,
you know what?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.418
Don't try to sell me one.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.187
Okay, seriously.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.122
'Cause I'm just here
to learn.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.089
Okay.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.325
So I know about
most of these, but--
Okay.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.895
Whoa, stop! Whoa!
That's my Drakkar Noir.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.564
No, this says
Rite Aid "Night Swept."

18:17.597 --> 18:19.299
No, it is a perfect
smell-alike.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.267
I'm not paying
for the label.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.368
Right here, give it.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.702
It's empty.
No, it's not.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.404
There's some
in the straw.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.842
There.
Now you may throw it out.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.514
Wow.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.649
How many Filet-O-Fishes
did you eat?

18:36.683 --> 18:39.352
That's over
several months, Ryan.

18:39.386 --> 18:42.222
Still...

18:42.255 --> 18:43.256
What's up?

18:43.290 --> 18:44.291
I'm bored.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.260
Thank you
for choosing me.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.161
No, I'm kidding.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.198
Um, so you got
big plans this weekend?

18:51.231 --> 18:54.667
Uh...well, I think
I'm gonna see Katy.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.236
Really?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.604
Yeah.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.705
What are you guys
gonna do?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.308
Oh, man, I don't know.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.311
Uh, dinner,
drinks, movie...

19:04.344 --> 19:06.813
matching tattoos.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.215
That's great.
Big stuff.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.316
That's, mmm.
Yeah.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.184
What are you doing?

19:11.218 --> 19:13.320
I was gonna say
I think that, um...

19:13.353 --> 19:15.188
we're gonna
help Roy's cousin move.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.358
Okay.
'Cause Roy's got a truck.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.592
That's cool.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.860
Uh-huh.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.295
Yes.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.596
That is cool.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.265
But I'll see you
Monday, though, right?

19:25.298 --> 19:26.366
Great.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.235
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna head back.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.336
All right.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.710
I think, in order
to be a ladies' man,

19:37.744 --> 19:40.513
it's imperative that people
don't know you're a ladies' man.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.582
So I kind of play that
close to the chest.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.753
I don't know, what can I say?
Women are attracted to power.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.222
And I think...

19:49.256 --> 19:51.958
other people have told me
I have a very symmetrical face.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.964
I don't know.
I don't know.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.401
Maybe they're right.
I don't know.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.746
(Michael)
Sure you don't want me
to help you with that?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.315
'Cause I can grab that,
no problem.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.749
(Katy)
It was nice to meet
some of you.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.819
See ya later!
Good night!

20:19.852 --> 20:21.588
Good night, Jim.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.822
Good night, Michael.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.724
Where you going?

20:24.757 --> 20:27.360
I don't know.
Grab a drink, I think.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.462
With us?

20:29.496 --> 20:32.365
I, um, I probably
should have told you,

20:32.399 --> 20:33.366
I don't need a ride now

20:33.400 --> 20:34.767
'cause Jim can
take me home after.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.369
So you're off the hook.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.337
Okay, great, off the hook.
Excellent.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.339
Okay, cool.
(Jim)
I got this.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.642
Have fun.
Don't drink and drive.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.910
Take it easy.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.011
Have a good night.
You too.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.446
Have a good night!
You got that?

20:46.479 --> 20:47.714
Oh, yeah.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.849
You sold a lot,
so it's lighter.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.451
I bet.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.885
Well, here...

20:52.919 --> 20:55.388
[clears throat loudly]

20:55.422 --> 20:57.357
[engine starts]

20:57.390 --> 20:59.392
All right, now,
I'm gonna warn you.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.860
Don't freak out, okay?
Why?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.362
This is a really nice car.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.964
In case you haven't noticed,
this is a Corolla, okay?

21:04.997 --> 21:06.899
It's a very nice car.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.535
So you're not
gonna freak out?

21:08.568 --> 21:11.504
Do I have
a special someone?

21:11.538 --> 21:14.006
Uh, well, yeah,
of course.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.475
A bunch of 'em.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.744
My employees.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.912
If I had to choose between
a one-night-stand

21:19.946 --> 21:21.981
with some stupid cow
I pick up at a bar

21:22.014 --> 21:23.383
and these people,

21:23.416 --> 21:24.384
I'd pick them every time.

21:24.417 --> 21:28.788
Because with them,
it is an every day stand.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.823
And I still know
their names in the morning.
