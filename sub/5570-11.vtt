00:01.102 --> 00:01.902
BRIAN:
Previously on Limitless...

00:01.935 --> 00:02.703
CASEY:
It's a drug, isn't it?

00:02.736 --> 00:04.772
All my guys are trying
to figure out

00:04.805 --> 00:06.040
what's up
with Brian Finch.

00:06.074 --> 00:07.208
He's wanted for murder,
and then he

00:07.241 --> 00:09.443
suddenly works for us.
He's a genius.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.811
I know.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.712
Has to be a drug.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.481
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.216
How do you know
about me and Casey?

00:15.249 --> 00:17.485
BRIAN: His cologne,
it lingers on you.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.153
Your reaction when Naz
suggested he train me.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.455
The way he shows up at your...
Thank you. I get it.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.257
Do you ever think
about what it's like?

00:23.291 --> 00:24.125
Taking whatever Finch is on?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.360
How could I not?
I see the kid every day.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.196
But I'd never do it.
Maybe I just think,

00:28.229 --> 00:29.697
if you took one
of those pills,

00:29.730 --> 00:31.665
I don't see how
you ever stop.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.406
*

00:45.546 --> 00:48.682
(ringtone plays)

00:55.523 --> 00:57.525
(phone ringing)

01:01.129 --> 01:02.196
WOMAN:
It's him.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.200
It's not 7:00 yet.
(ringing continues)

01:06.234 --> 01:07.368
Don't answer.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.607
(knocking at door)

01:15.276 --> 01:17.345
Sorry to bother you, man,
but it's him again.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.180
I was wondering if
you could maybe pick me up

01:19.213 --> 01:20.414
some cat food on your
way in this morning?

01:20.448 --> 01:22.283
You don't even
have a cat.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.284
No.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.418
But I do have
a neighbor.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.587
Who is cute and
does have a cat.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.256
And I'm gonna feed him

01:28.289 --> 01:29.390
while she's away at
a music festival.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.392
I'm gonna wind up
feeding a cat

01:31.425 --> 01:32.593
for five days, aren't I?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.462
He only eats
grain-free salmon.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.496
Thanks, pal.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.470
MAN:
It's stress.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.804
IKE:
Seriously?

01:43.837 --> 01:45.573
My hand looks like
I have leprosy,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.175
and it's stress?

01:47.208 --> 01:50.278
Anxiety can do any number
of things to the human body.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.412
(sighs)

01:51.445 --> 01:53.447
I can prescribe
a cortisone cream...

01:53.481 --> 01:54.882
but have you
considered meditation

01:54.915 --> 01:56.450
as a means of coping?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.688
(cell phone ringing)

02:00.721 --> 02:02.823
Oh...

02:02.856 --> 02:04.158
What is it, Finch?

02:04.192 --> 02:06.294
Ike! Listen, man,
I wouldn't be calling,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.296
but I know you live
near Mandy's Records.
I'm at the doctor.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.398
...and it was Record
Store Day this weekend,

02:10.431 --> 02:12.166
but by the time
I was done working,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.501
they were all sold out
of Artificial Brain.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.935
"Artificial Brain"?
That's the name of the album?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.437
That's the name
of the band.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.206
The name of the album is
Labyrinth Constellation.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.374
You want to write it down
so you don't forget?

02:20.408 --> 02:22.710
Yeah, thank you.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.745
*

02:26.314 --> 02:27.281
So I don't get it.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.184
You're just supposed
to sit there and do nothing?

02:30.218 --> 02:31.919
You're concentrating
on the moment.

02:31.952 --> 02:32.953
That's not nothing.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.688
That's the hardest thing,

02:34.722 --> 02:36.890
according to people
who meditate.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.927
You gotta find a Zen place
with this gig, man.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.229
It's temporary.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.896
See, it's-it's
temporary for you.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.433
I mean, they already told you,
you do this for a year,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.535
you got a permanent gig
at the CJC.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.670
They didn't say
anything like that to me.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.639
As far as I know,
this is permanent.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.775
And I've been having
the craziest dreams.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.611
It's me and a succession
of guys Finch calls Mike.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.979
(buzzing, door opens)

02:59.012 --> 03:00.914
There's Asian Mike.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.550
There's a white Mike.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.552
There's even a woman
he calls Mike.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.554
Hey, boys.
Be right back.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.289
And we spend a year
together, right?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.690
Mike.
The girl Mike.

03:09.723 --> 03:10.991
And in my mind,

03:11.024 --> 03:12.693
we start to develop
a rapport, you know?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.562
Like maybe this is even
going to become something.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.364
See, but I've lost
track of the fact

03:16.397 --> 03:18.299
that I'm, like, eight
years older than her.

03:18.332 --> 03:21.302
And she wants nothing to do
with the Brian Finch lifer.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.904
So the fictional
female Mike

03:23.937 --> 03:25.906
can't wait to get
away from you?
Yes.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.475
Here you go, fellas.
Today's dose.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.544
Thank you.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.579
Thank you.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.384
(sighs)

03:36.417 --> 03:40.421
Meditation might
really help you.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.555
Yes!

03:41.589 --> 03:42.790
Man, have I told you guys

03:42.823 --> 03:43.857
how much
I appreciate you lately?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.327
'Cause I sure as heck do.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.762
*

03:48.796 --> 03:50.331
* Oh, yeah

03:51.399 --> 03:54.368
* Tighten up on that bass now

03:54.402 --> 03:55.035
* Tighten it up

03:55.068 --> 03:57.305
* Ha ha, yeah

03:57.338 --> 03:58.939
* Now let that guitar
fall in... *

03:58.972 --> 04:00.374
IKE:
Hey, what does he want

04:00.408 --> 04:02.810
with a gas mask
and a bunch of PVC pipe anyway?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.545
* Oh, yeah

04:06.614 --> 04:08.416
* Tighten up on
that organ now... *

04:08.449 --> 04:11.352
Hey, you don't know this
is a permanent gig.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.521
Just be the best
bodyguard you can be,

04:13.554 --> 04:14.522
and someone will notice.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.956
That's easy for you to say.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.359
You had the best
PT scores at Quantico.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.460
You won the marksmanship award.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.561
Everyone's watching you.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.895
(buzzing)

04:21.929 --> 04:23.431
The whole point
of this job

04:23.464 --> 04:24.798
is to fade into
the woodwork.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.834
How am I supposed
to get noticed?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.269
Here you go, (bleep).

04:30.371 --> 04:31.972
Thank you.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.443
(rapid inhaling)

04:37.478 --> 04:38.446
BRIAN:
All right.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.647
Ah.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.714
Thanks, guys.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.819
Whoa... my God.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.922
Ike, you should
get that looked at.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.362
(gagging)

04:54.395 --> 04:56.397
* Mama, you know

04:56.430 --> 04:57.698
* What's best...

04:57.731 --> 04:58.932
IKE:
I tried it this morning.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.334
Meditating.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.435
Didn't work.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.436
MIKE:
"Didn't work"?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.771
I'm pretty sure that's not how

05:03.804 --> 05:05.105
you're supposed
to think about it.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.340
Fine.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.442
If picturing
Brian Finch

05:08.476 --> 05:10.711
and imagining all the ways
female Mike can reject me

05:10.744 --> 05:12.980
is how you're
supposed to meditate...

05:13.013 --> 05:14.348
then I killed it.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.350
Oh, boy.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.552
Do you think we'll stay
in touch when this is all over?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.454
Yeah.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.755
Of course, yeah.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.824
Definitely.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.363
Evelyn?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.398
Hello?

05:32.866 --> 05:33.901
Hey.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.038
(guns cock)

05:42.710 --> 05:43.911
Oh, damn, (bleep). Look.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.416
MIKE:
Call Harris.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.752
Tell her the dispensary's
been compromised.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.588
We need immediate backup

05:54.622 --> 05:56.023
at the Gerwin-Strauss dispensary
in Greenpoint.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.467
FBI.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.300
Don't move.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.570
Put your hands where
I can see them.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.571
IKE:
What?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.639
No, this is...

06:13.173 --> 06:14.842
(clicks)

06:14.875 --> 06:15.943
MIKE:
Damn safety.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.413
(gunshot, Ike groans)

06:22.483 --> 06:24.518
Oh, God.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.119
Stay with me.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.422
All right?

06:28.456 --> 06:30.891
Why'd you have to go
and do that?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.427
It's gonna be
okay, buddy.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.495
It's gonna be okay.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.531
*

06:44.772 --> 06:46.607
REBECCA:
You're gonna go out there,

06:46.640 --> 06:47.841
drink your drink...

06:47.875 --> 06:49.477
No, don't drink your drink.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.545
Go out there, say good-bye,

06:51.579 --> 06:53.046
and that's all there is to it.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.418
I'm good.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.054
I was thinking
about this weekend.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.055
You know Nick

07:02.089 --> 07:03.190
from my SWAT team?

07:03.223 --> 07:04.858
Yeah, I know Nick.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.161
Well, every year, a few of us
go up to his mountain house,

07:08.195 --> 07:10.230
up in the Gunks.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.866
And since Nick's married now

07:12.900 --> 07:14.835
and starting
a new chapter of his life,

07:14.868 --> 07:16.604
uh, he decided to open up

07:16.637 --> 07:18.606
the invite to
our significant others.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.640
Well, Casey, I think...

07:19.673 --> 07:21.942
I know that that would mean
telling them about us,

07:21.975 --> 07:24.478
but these guys,
they're like brothers to me.

07:24.512 --> 07:27.948
And, uh... I think
it would be good for us

07:27.981 --> 07:29.249
to get out of the city together.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.151
Unless...

07:31.184 --> 07:32.586
you had something
else in mind.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.787
Well...

07:37.190 --> 07:38.892
Mmm.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.466
Let me think about that.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.903
(cell phone ringing)

07:52.940 --> 07:53.974
What is it?

07:54.007 --> 07:54.975
IKE:
We need immediate backup

07:55.008 --> 07:56.877
at the Gerwin-Strauss dispensary
in Greenpoint.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.979
And alert SAC Pouran.

07:59.012 --> 07:59.980
Casey...

08:00.013 --> 08:00.948
IKE:
What? No, this is...

08:03.116 --> 08:04.084
Are you still there?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.719
What happened?

08:05.753 --> 08:06.720
(gunshots)

08:06.754 --> 08:07.788
Can you hear me?

08:07.821 --> 08:08.989
If you can hear me,

08:09.022 --> 08:10.090
I'm calling
an ambulance, okay?

08:10.123 --> 08:11.258
What's going on?
It's classified.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.093
Have to go.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.228
(elevator bell dings)

08:16.930 --> 08:18.599
NAZ:
It was an accident.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.100
These things happen.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.802
REBECCA:
How is he?

08:21.835 --> 08:22.803
He's still in surgery.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.071
What happened?

08:24.104 --> 08:25.873
I forgot to take off the safety.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.941
BRIAN:
Mike, it's
just a mistake.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.977
And I'm sure
Ike's gonna be okay.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.980
He almost died today
because of you and your drug.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.550
Least you could do is call him
by his real name.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.255
(sighs)

08:42.289 --> 08:43.891
BRIAN:
It's just that
they've been

08:43.924 --> 08:45.559
Mike and Ike for so long...

08:45.593 --> 08:47.094
Go ahead and take that, please.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.103
The dispensary
that was raided belongs to

08:56.136 --> 08:58.572
a private pharmaceutical lab
that manufactures and securely

08:58.606 --> 09:00.340
stores our NZT supply.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.576
Well, not that securely.
I mean, that guy knew about it.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.844
NAZ:
There were three
of them, actually.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.278
And no,
I don't think they did know.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.513
The shooter's cohorts

09:06.546 --> 09:09.750
cleared out of there before
he discovered the NZT locker.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.019
Seems they were targeting
oxycodone.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.020
That makes sense.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.287
It's the highest street value.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.356
Not now that they have
over 6,000 NZT pills.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.758
Six thousand?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.359
NAZ:
Enough to fetch
a pretty penny

09:19.392 --> 09:20.894
and do some serious damage

09:20.928 --> 09:22.195
if it got into the wrong hands.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.364
So we have
to find them

09:24.397 --> 09:26.700
before they realize
what they have.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.945
Hey. So I searched
social media pics by location

09:37.978 --> 09:40.881
to see if I could find any
by the dispensary this morning,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.916
and it turns out a
guy took a selfie

09:42.950 --> 09:44.918
of him and his hedgehog--
don't ask--

09:44.952 --> 09:46.787
right around the time
we think our perps

09:46.820 --> 09:49.056
were getting out of what looked
like a gray Ford Fusion.

09:49.089 --> 09:49.990
Now, I could only get
a partial plate,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.992
but I did type up
a list of possibilities.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.294
Turns out that one matched a car
that was stolen in Michigan

09:54.327 --> 09:57.064
two days ago:
a gray Ford Fusion.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.802
You did all this while
I was getting my coffee?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.336
Yeah.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.074
Well, I'll make some calls.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.075
I'll see if anyone
at Michigan PD

10:08.108 --> 10:09.009
can help us I.D. our guys.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.043
That's great.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.981
MALE VOICE:
Thank you for
continuing to hold.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.883
Hey, you busy?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.885
No, I'm on hold.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.052
Seems like you guys
got everything handled.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.087
Uh, can you
cover for me?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.088
You just got here.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.422
Yeah. Um, I have...

10:22.455 --> 10:23.757
stuff going on at home.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.358
How is she?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.260
Been better.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.229
Yes, yeah.
Take all the time you need.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.698
Thank you.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.766
So I spoke to Michigan PD...

10:32.800 --> 10:34.902
Wh... what are you doing?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.770
You're doing
some string art?

10:36.804 --> 10:37.705
(muffled):
Or a spiderweb,

10:37.738 --> 10:39.707
as Mike called it
right before he told me

10:39.740 --> 10:40.674
to spin the damn thing myself.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.075
Ah.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.377
Do you think I'm disrespectful?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.714
Maybe Mike could
just use a break

10:46.747 --> 10:47.881
from arts and
crafts detail.

10:47.915 --> 10:48.882
Yeah.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.718
So, Michigan PD.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.853
They said the perps who stole
the Ford had accents.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.688
French, they think,
but I'm thinking,

10:54.722 --> 10:56.924
because it's Michigan,
it's probably...
French Canadian!

10:56.957 --> 10:58.826
QuГ©bГ©cois, technically.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.393
I called the manager
of the gas station

11:00.427 --> 11:01.428
where the car
was stolen.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.096
He thinks one of
our guys came in

11:03.130 --> 11:04.431
a few minutes earlier
looking for Smarties.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.433
Smarties?
No?

11:06.466 --> 11:07.935
Canadian M&M's.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.369
Oh. Well, okay.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.938
So we're on the same page
about the French Canadians.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.840
And I'm a few chapters
ahead, actually.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.375
I searched Narcotics files
over the past two years,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.044
and I found
a Michigan chiropractor

11:17.077 --> 11:18.846
involved in
a prescription drug ring.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.848
But he's in jail.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.182
So I almost gave up...

11:22.215 --> 11:23.483
After, what, ten minutes?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.452
...when I saw it was

11:25.485 --> 11:28.722
a Gerwin-Strauss employee's
testimony that put him there.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.991
And the name of his
former cellmate?

11:31.024 --> 11:34.294
Henri Bouchard,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.396
ex-QuГ©bГ©cois
arrested for robbery,

11:36.429 --> 11:38.766
released four
months ago.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.067
I think the chiropractor

11:40.100 --> 11:43.036
put Henri onto
the Gerwin-Strauss dispensary.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.338
What about the, uh, spiderweb?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.874
Henri's likely using
the same contacts

11:46.907 --> 11:49.843
to sell the oxy in Battle Creek,

11:49.877 --> 11:52.179
and this map

11:52.212 --> 11:54.047
shows all the highways

11:54.081 --> 11:55.983
and the back roads you could use
to get there.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.384
And this right here

11:57.417 --> 11:59.987
is our best chance
of intercepting them.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.855
Now, given the time
that Henri and his amis

12:01.889 --> 12:03.056
left the dispensaire,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.292
I'm estimating that
they'll hit that point

12:05.325 --> 12:06.760
in about seven hours from now.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.928
I'll go fill in Naz.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.763
Oh, I already did that,
actually.

12:09.797 --> 12:13.100
And she wants to fly you there
with someone from SWAT.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.803
So, I casually suggested
a particular someone.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.070
You can thank me later.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.941
Though I now see from your face

12:20.974 --> 12:24.111
I've made a terrible mistake.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.979
What face?

12:31.484 --> 12:34.822
CASEY:
It turns out Nick's wife
can't make it this weekend.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.023
She's gotta work or something.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.791
So he said we could
have the master.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.392
Wait, what?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.831
I never agreed to go.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.299
And, more importantly,

12:46.333 --> 12:47.968
how were you able to have
this conversation

12:48.001 --> 12:49.469
without telling him
that we were dating?

12:49.502 --> 12:51.338
I told you, Nick's like
a brother to me.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.840
He would've
figured it out anyway.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.241
(sighs)

12:54.274 --> 12:56.376
Just like I figured out
why we're really here.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.111
No matter how much oxy
those guys stole,

12:58.145 --> 12:59.847
no way the CJC
would be involved

12:59.880 --> 13:03.817
unless we were going after
that drug Finch is on.

13:03.851 --> 13:04.818
I get it.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.854
You can't talk
about it.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.489
The point is, the truth
always comes out.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.992
So we might as well be
honest about each other.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.862
You're right.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.064
We should.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.099
Casey, I-I've been
thinking that...

13:19.132 --> 13:21.201
MAN (over radio):
They're heading towards you.
I've been...

13:21.234 --> 13:23.203
Let's do it.
Okay.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.338
*

13:40.020 --> 13:41.554
(tires squealing)

13:41.588 --> 13:42.890
Move out! Go!

13:42.923 --> 13:44.191
Go, go!
(guns cocking)

13:45.558 --> 13:47.427
Get out, get out!
Get out of the car!

13:47.460 --> 13:48.862
Down!
Get down!

13:48.896 --> 13:51.064
Get down! On the ground!
(Henri speaking French)

13:51.098 --> 13:52.933
Where I can see 'em!
Hands up!

13:52.966 --> 13:54.501
On the ground now!
Ground now!

13:54.534 --> 13:57.004
(siren wailing)
On the ground!
On the ground now!

13:57.037 --> 13:59.039
(indistinct shouting)

14:05.012 --> 14:06.179
So what's going on
with you two?

14:06.213 --> 14:07.447
I know you
haven't broken up.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.581
I would've
noticed the signs,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.050
and given your current
body language...

14:10.083 --> 14:10.951
Are you NZT'ing me
right now?

14:10.984 --> 14:12.652
Because I don't want
to talk about it.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.654
Well, that's because you
don't like confrontation.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.356
I get that. I'm just
trying to repay you

14:16.389 --> 14:17.891
for all the times I've
asked for your advice.

14:17.925 --> 14:18.691
I didn't ask!

14:18.725 --> 14:19.792
I know, you never would,
because you

14:19.826 --> 14:22.029
don't like confrontation.
Don't like confrontation.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.997
Fine. I...

14:24.031 --> 14:27.034
I-I don't know how
to start the conversation.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.201
And every time I try...

14:28.235 --> 14:29.436
You back down?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.538
Okay. So... compose what
you want to say

14:31.571 --> 14:33.206
without giving him
a chance to interrupt,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.008
or redirect, and that way

14:35.042 --> 14:37.477
you won't feel like...
(phone chimes)

14:37.510 --> 14:39.980
Did you just break up
with him over text?

14:40.013 --> 14:42.315
Hey. Naz, conference room now.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.052
NAZ:
Though the recovery last night
seemed successful,

14:45.085 --> 14:46.453
we have an issue.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.021
(door opens)

14:48.055 --> 14:51.058
Rooks, please join us.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.967
As soon as you're ready,
Agent Harris... Yeah?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.634
Thank you very much.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.236
Somewhere between
the theft at Gerwin-Strauss

15:03.270 --> 15:06.073
and when we received
the evidence last night,

15:06.106 --> 15:07.707
80 pills went missing.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.043
You think someone
skimmed off the top.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.411
Gerwin-Strauss keeps
meticulous records,

15:11.444 --> 15:14.281
so I doubt it's a miscalculation
on their part.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.416
So that leaves Michigan PD

15:16.449 --> 15:17.985
and us.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.020
Now, I don't think
I have to worry

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
about anyone in this room, do I?

15:21.388 --> 15:22.990
If you think
I pocketed some

15:23.023 --> 15:24.591
at the crime scene,
I was too busy

15:24.624 --> 15:25.993
keeping my partner
from bleeding out.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.160
(phone chimes)

15:27.194 --> 15:27.827
NAZ:
Rooks?

15:27.860 --> 15:29.462
What did you see last night?

15:29.496 --> 15:33.166
Um... (sighs) Sorry.
He was with me.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.403
And the drugs were transported
in a different van,

15:36.436 --> 15:39.973
so he wouldn't have
had the opportunity.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.309
CASEY:
And none of my men

15:42.342 --> 15:44.311
would risk their careers
over prescription pills.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.545
Oh, no, neither would I.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.214
But we're not talking
about oxycodone anymore.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.384
Then maybe someone
should tell me

15:51.418 --> 15:53.153
what we are talking about.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.522
NAZ:
There's a Schedule I drug

15:55.555 --> 15:58.758
that the CJC has a particular
vested interest in.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
It's called NZT-48.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.006
CASEY:
What's this?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.174
What am I looking at?

16:16.276 --> 16:19.012
We all know that Finch kid
takes some kind of clear pill.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.747
And that's what
this is, right?

16:20.780 --> 16:21.981
You got these
from the Canadians?

16:22.015 --> 16:24.451
They had thousands of them.
Their trunk was better stocked

16:24.484 --> 16:25.718
than Lil Wayne's tour bus,
all right?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.620
You need new
material, man.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.789
I don't care what story
you gotta make up.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.458
You're gonna return those
to evidence.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.559
What if we kept just one sheet?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.361
NICK:
I'll admit,
I'm curious.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.528
You said these things
turned Finch

16:35.562 --> 16:36.463
into some kind of
fighting machine.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.264
That in two days,

16:37.297 --> 16:39.032
he learned what
took you five years.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.601
If they can make that clown
go from zero to 60,

16:41.634 --> 16:43.136
imagine what they
could do for us.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.237
RUSS:
I don't know.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.473
Seems unnatural.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.175
Wolverine is unnatural,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.110
but that son of a bitch
is still a superhero.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.045
I want to be a superhero.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.046
All right?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.481
(Kevin chuckles)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.516
(phone ringing)

16:58.851 --> 16:59.819
CASEY:
SWAT.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.122
Yeah, I'll be
right up.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.656
I gotta report upstairs.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.724
KEVIN:
Hey, Casey,
come on, dude.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.393
I only took these
because I thought you'd be in.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.694
Yeah, but this time,

17:07.727 --> 17:09.296
it's not just our jobs
on the line.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.697
It's Rebecca's.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.365
She led point
on that retrieval.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.134
I don't want this
coming down on her.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.336
Just get rid of 'em.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.538
NAZ: Rooks?
What did you see last night?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.241
REBECCA:
Um... uh...

17:21.274 --> 17:24.211
Sorry. He was with me.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.313
And the drugs
were transported

17:26.346 --> 17:28.781
in a different van, so...

17:28.815 --> 17:30.517
he wouldn't have had
the opportunity.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.186
And none of my men would risk

17:33.220 --> 17:34.621
their careers over
prescription pills.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.855
NAZ:
Oh, no, neither would I.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.091
But we're not talking
about oxycodone anymore.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.860
Then maybe someone
should tell me

17:40.893 --> 17:42.662
what we are talking about.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.731
What the hell was that?

17:44.764 --> 17:48.135
I-I should've
told you about NZT.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.103
You think that's
why I'm upset?

17:50.137 --> 17:53.206
You just broke up
with me over text.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.442
In the middle
of a conference.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.144
I texted you before the meeting.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.179
It just didn't send.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.847
But you couldn't
just talk to me

18:00.880 --> 18:02.182
face to face?

18:02.215 --> 18:03.250
Why?

18:03.283 --> 18:04.817
Because we're at work?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.453
Because you were
always more concerned

18:06.486 --> 18:09.289
with office politics
than us?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.658
What happened between
last night and today?

18:11.691 --> 18:12.792
Nothing.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.198
How long have you felt
this wasn't working?

18:21.368 --> 18:23.303
It never was.

18:24.871 --> 18:25.838
Right.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.641
At least I know
the truth now.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.847
We do this one time.
What?

18:34.881 --> 18:36.883
Are you for real?
What changed your mind?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.919
Curiosity.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.889
Just see what it's like,
and then dump the rest.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.157
Nick, you in?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.692
I'm in if you're in, brother.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.228
RUSS:
Where do we go?

18:48.261 --> 18:51.364
Just see where
the pill takes us, huh?

18:51.398 --> 18:52.899
Let's go.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.834
CASEY:
One shot to do
anything you want.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.303
What would you do?

18:58.871 --> 19:02.242
Fine, I'll start.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.614
I'd win the Abu Dhabi
Combat Club World Championship.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.219
Five minutes of killer stand-up
on The Tonight Show.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.723
I want to do
a solo climb of K2.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.892
To average 30 points
a game in the NBA.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.264
And why the hell not?

19:24.297 --> 19:26.299
("A Child Is Born"
by the Aggregation playing)

19:35.975 --> 19:39.279
*

19:41.481 --> 19:44.183
*

19:47.520 --> 19:49.989
*
(horn honks)

19:50.022 --> 19:52.525
(audience laughing)
KEVIN: All right, and, like...
and, like, it's like...

19:52.559 --> 19:54.527
it's like 4:00 in the morning...

19:55.562 --> 19:57.664
What'd y'all do last weekend?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.966
(stand-up continues
indistinctly)

19:59.999 --> 20:01.801
*

20:05.705 --> 20:09.208
*

20:12.812 --> 20:14.447
(whooping)

20:15.482 --> 20:18.718
(shouting, indistinct chatter)

20:20.052 --> 20:21.454
All right, eight-six. Ball.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.855
(song ends)

20:22.889 --> 20:25.692
Hey. Let's go.
Come on! Come on!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.327
Oh!
CASEY:
Hey.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.328
You all right?

20:28.361 --> 20:29.429
What happened,
baby?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.963
Yeah. No, I...

20:31.964 --> 20:32.965
...think I'm just coming down.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.634
Yeah. All right, look,

20:34.667 --> 20:36.469
I'm gonna call it a night, dude.
Okay.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.338
We're gonna meet up tomorrow.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.006
Well, look who's come around

20:40.039 --> 20:41.974
about dumping the rest
of that stash, right?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.543
(chuckles)

20:43.576 --> 20:45.545
Night, boys.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.746
Russ.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.484
You tired?

20:51.518 --> 20:54.321
Why don't we swing by
McSorely's on the way home?

20:54.354 --> 20:57.324
I'm buying.
Why not?

20:58.525 --> 21:00.527
(cell phone ringing)

21:08.901 --> 21:10.002
Hey.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.038
I need your help, man.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.272
Now.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.443
I don't know
what happened.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.479
It was that
drug, man.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.782
Look, it started
on the basketball court,

21:22.815 --> 21:25.084
and... and I don't know
what happened, it was like...

21:25.117 --> 21:28.321
it was like I smelled
him on Alicia.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.457
When did you see Alicia?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.458
I didn't. No.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.459
In my mind.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.460
In my memories.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.395
It was... like... (sighs)

21:37.029 --> 21:39.098
A couple of weeks ago,
I was pretty convinced

21:39.131 --> 21:40.633
that she was cheating on me.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.403
Last night, I knew it.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.871
After Russ and I ended up here,

21:44.904 --> 21:46.739
I confronted
him about it.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.008
Things escalated...

21:49.041 --> 21:51.077
I choked him out.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.016
I didn't...
I didn't mean to.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.353
It was that drug, man.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.389
We need to call a lawyer.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.424
And say what?

22:06.459 --> 22:10.096
Casey, if I'm arrested for this,
my best defense

22:10.129 --> 22:12.999
is to say that I was on NZT,
which Kevin stole from evidence,

22:13.032 --> 22:15.668
which you encouraged
your team to take.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.838
They're drug-testing us, and we
are all going down for this.

22:18.871 --> 22:22.041
All because Russ was
screwing my wife,

22:22.074 --> 22:24.544
and because I killed Russ
for screwing my wife.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.880
You want me to help you
cover this up?

22:30.617 --> 22:33.386
I can't even think straight.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.926
Well, you're not
gonna take that.

22:44.664 --> 22:45.965
Why not?

22:45.998 --> 22:47.700
Didn't make me kill anyone.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.703
What, you seriously think that I
did this because I wanted to?

22:50.737 --> 22:53.105
No, I just think
you were messed up

22:53.139 --> 22:55.542
and made a really,
really bad decision.

23:12.559 --> 23:16.028
Let me just start by restating
this is all very screwed up.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.997
Nick was right that we
can't just come clean.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.032
The FBI doesn't want
the world to know

23:20.066 --> 23:21.801
that they're experimenting
with NZT.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.971
So someone somewhere would
keep you from testifying,

23:25.004 --> 23:27.674
most likely by silencing
you... and me.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.876
Kevin, too,
since he stole the pills.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.211
And let's face it-- what's
three more bodies to them?

23:32.244 --> 23:36.215
So Nick's decision wasn't as bad
as I'd initially thought.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.085
Are you kidding me?

23:39.118 --> 23:40.753
He killed Russ.

23:40.787 --> 23:44.023
And you stole 80 pills they were
never going to let disappear.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.058
Let me be very clear--
I'm not saying

23:46.092 --> 23:47.560
Nick should have killed Russ.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.196
But since he did, from
a macro perspective,

23:50.229 --> 23:54.066
the best thing we can do
is to pin the theft on Russ.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.603
He stole the NZT that night
and then disappeared.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.204
I'm meeting
SAC Pouran.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.472
I'm gonna tell her my story.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.840
Meet me outside in an hour.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.678
*

24:05.712 --> 24:07.146
(singing to himself
indistinctly)

24:07.179 --> 24:08.147
Confidence, man.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.248
You got this.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.784
Just go in there
and tell your story.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.587
You got your team into this
mess, now get 'em out of it.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.957
If you're nervous, find
something to distract yourself,

24:17.990 --> 24:19.626
shift your focus.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.074
You mind if I
borrow this?

24:38.545 --> 24:40.880
(resumes singing
to himself indistinctly)

24:44.917 --> 24:46.218
BRIAN:
Hey, Casey.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.887
What's up, man? I've
been looking for you.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.556
I'm waiting
to meet with Pouran.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.190
Oh, this will just
take a second.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.192
You know those pills
that were stolen?

24:53.225 --> 24:54.861
Well, I decided
to start mapping

24:54.894 --> 24:56.863
the strange occurrences
around the tristate area,

24:56.896 --> 24:59.198
thinking that's one way to
track down the drug, right?

24:59.231 --> 25:03.235
Finding people doing things
that kind of scream "NZT."

25:03.269 --> 25:04.904
And I found an
Instagram account

25:04.937 --> 25:07.907
that tracked someone climbing
a building in Gramercy Park

25:07.940 --> 25:09.208
without a rope last night.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.077
Crazy.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.144
I know.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.648
Check out his shoes.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.819
What am I looking at?

25:19.852 --> 25:22.288
They're Frye combat
boots, like yours.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.757
Popular shoe.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.659
Yeah, but not with climbers.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.061
He ties them
like yours, too.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.298
Top two hooks unlaced, but
tied around the ankles.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.232
Now, I know
what you're thinking:

25:33.265 --> 25:35.001
A lot of people
lace their boots that way.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.135
It's comfortable.

25:36.168 --> 25:39.672
But not a lot of guys with
those boots tied that way

25:39.706 --> 25:42.074
had access to NZT yesterday.

25:47.113 --> 25:50.282
This is very helpful, Brian.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.284
One of my guys has
been off the grid

25:52.318 --> 25:54.353
since that NZT-48
went missing.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.589
This could be him.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.091
I'll be sure to bring it up
with Pouran.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.595
Thanks again.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.631
No problem.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.736
Agent Rooks.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.677
Why did you want
to see me?

26:26.753 --> 26:30.757
STAVROS: * I gave my heart
and soul to you, girl *

26:32.759 --> 26:35.728
* Didn't I do it, baby?

26:35.762 --> 26:39.065
* Didn't I do it,
baby? *

26:39.098 --> 26:40.066
(record scratch)

26:40.099 --> 26:42.101
*

26:44.804 --> 26:46.272
BRIAN:
This one's for you, man.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.409
* You and me...

26:50.442 --> 26:53.145
What's with
the song?

26:53.179 --> 26:55.682
He told me this one
is his favorite,

26:55.715 --> 26:57.149
makes him think of you guys.

26:57.183 --> 26:59.318
* Hey, hey, hey...

26:59.351 --> 27:00.987
You didn't know
that, did you?

27:01.020 --> 27:03.990
* My, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my... *
No.

27:04.023 --> 27:07.059
I guess, I mean, you guys do
spend a lot of time together.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.296
It's not weird
that he'd pick a song.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.198
It's not that weird.

27:12.231 --> 27:15.935
* If I never see
the setting sun again... *

27:15.968 --> 27:18.404
So, effective immediately,

27:18.437 --> 27:20.072
I'm done taking
you guys for granted.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.074
Really.

27:22.108 --> 27:25.011
I'm not gonna ask you
to get me gummy worms...

27:25.044 --> 27:28.447
I'm not just gonna
ask you to get me gummy worms.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.684
I'm also gonna treat you like
the trained agents that you are.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.686
Okay?

27:33.720 --> 27:34.887
Okay.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.889
Okay.

27:36.923 --> 27:40.026
So there's 80 NZT pills
out there still.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.028
Whoever has them
might be using them

27:42.061 --> 27:43.963
to do some
NZT-type stuff.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.298
So I asked James Tech
to pull together

27:46.332 --> 27:48.267
everything weird
that happened last night.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.103
* ...the same about you

27:51.137 --> 27:52.839
(chuckles)
* It's a natural fact

27:52.872 --> 27:54.874
* There's no turning back...

27:54.907 --> 27:56.843
"The Great Throwdini set
the world record

27:56.876 --> 27:59.846
for throwing consecutive
knives at a human target."

27:59.879 --> 28:01.714
Hmm, not what I'd do on NZT.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.049
Me, neither.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.484
* Oh, oh, oh, oh...

28:05.517 --> 28:06.953
(laughs)

28:06.986 --> 28:09.421
Impressive? Yes.

28:09.455 --> 28:12.124
But if I stole NZT, I don't
think I'd give it to a dog.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.359
How about you, bud?
What do you think?

28:13.392 --> 28:15.227
Think this is in
the discard pile?

28:15.261 --> 28:16.996
Huh?

28:17.029 --> 28:20.132
Do you think he can hear us?

28:23.169 --> 28:25.805
Oh, hey, Ike.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.139
Can you hear me, bud?

28:27.173 --> 28:28.808
Can't wait to have
you back, man.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.277
I've got all sorts
of fun stuff for us to do.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.378
(screaming)

28:32.411 --> 28:36.048
I'm sure some version
of this is getting through.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.319
Huh.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.321
Some guy posted a bunch
of pictures on Instagram

28:42.354 --> 28:44.456
of a guy climbing
the building across from his.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.458
Let me see.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.395
I'm pretty sure those
are Frye combat boots.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.130
It's what we issue
to our tactical team.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.132
BRIAN: I've seen these
laced up like this.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.066
BRIAN: I know what
you're thinking--

28:54.100 --> 28:55.201
a lot of guys lace
their boots like that.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.470
But not a lot of guys
with those boots tied that way

28:58.504 --> 29:01.507
had access to NZT yesterday.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.548
This is really
helpful, Brian.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.918
See, one of my guys
has been off the grid

29:11.951 --> 29:14.020
since the NZT
went missing.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.554
And this could be him.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.457
I'll be sure to
bring it up with Pouran.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.828
Thanks again.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.129
No problem.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.176
NAZ:
Agent Rooks.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.857
NAZ:
Why did you want to see me?

29:52.925 --> 29:55.094
REBECCA:
There's no way Casey
skimmed those pills.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.830
I was with him the whole time
we took down those dealers.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.465
Okay, then one of
his guys stole them.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.034
But I am telling you--
he is on NZT right now.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.170
Is his team here today?

30:04.203 --> 30:06.372
Kevin Mitchell and Nick
Wallace are in the building.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.041
Well, they might be on NZT, too.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.042
What are you doing?

30:10.076 --> 30:11.543
I'm texting Naz
to let her know

30:11.577 --> 30:13.612
that three of her SWAT guys
might be on NZT.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.914
(cell phone chimes)

30:14.947 --> 30:15.747
Hey, Rebecca.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.585
Would you hand me
your gun, please?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.921
Casey, you're in trouble,

30:21.954 --> 30:25.157
but you are taking this to a
place you cannot come back from.

30:25.191 --> 30:28.060
CASEY: We're gonna figure this
out, but I need your gun.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.528
Please don't make me
point this at you.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.238
Why did you take it?

30:39.271 --> 30:40.239
What?

30:40.272 --> 30:42.108
The pill?

30:42.141 --> 30:44.010
It wasn't part
of some grand plan.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.345
It was in front of me,
and I thought maybe I'd try it.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.014
Maybe life could be better.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.448
Maybe I could be better.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.417
Don't we all think that
sometimes?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.955
And how's that upgrade
working out for you?

30:55.988 --> 30:59.525
'Cause it seems to me this
is a harsh measure to take

30:59.558 --> 31:01.994
to avoid turning over
a few pills.

31:02.028 --> 31:05.664
What else happened
last night, Casey?

31:05.697 --> 31:08.000
And where's Russ?

31:08.034 --> 31:09.902
NICK:
We're totally boned, man.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.303
She must have got
the word out.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.039
What? What
happened?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.473
NICK: The whole
building's on lockdown.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.142
How the hell are we
gonna get out of here?

31:16.175 --> 31:19.478
We have a bag full of pills
that makes us smarter

31:19.511 --> 31:21.313
than anyone in the world.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.049
All we need to do is think.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.951
Come here.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.058
KEVIN: Okay, we should just give
up, do our time and start over.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.492
KEVIN: Look, I just stole
some pills, okay?

31:33.525 --> 31:35.294
I didn't kill anybody.
And I'm sorry about that,

31:35.327 --> 31:37.529
but how do we back down now?
What do we do?

31:37.563 --> 31:38.998
Fight our way out of here?

31:39.031 --> 31:41.200
CASEY:
I want clear of this building.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.701
I just don't want
to hurt anyone.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.936
BRIAN:
Hey, guys.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.305
There's a way
through this.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.307
Look, you're outnumbered.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.109
There's probably agents
gathering

31:50.142 --> 31:51.177
upstairs right now.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.544
But you're SWAT.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.047
You've got resources
that nobody else has.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.116
So if you don't want
to kill anyone,

31:57.149 --> 31:59.218
you don't want
to kill anyone else,

31:59.251 --> 32:01.220
just pretend like there's
a riot out there.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.989
Tear gas.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.323
We can pepper-spray
all we want,

32:04.356 --> 32:06.425
but we still can't get
out of the building.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.094
If you can put the
building on lockdown,

32:08.127 --> 32:09.328
you can take the building
off lockdown.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.663
They control that
from the special ops room.

32:11.697 --> 32:12.564
Don't they?

32:12.598 --> 32:16.035
Anyone SA or higher
is trained to work it.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.603
I could turn it off.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.139
Suit up.
We're going to the CJC.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.174
No, this could be a trap.
BRIAN: Why?

32:22.208 --> 32:24.110
I want the same thing
you guys do.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.512
To get out of here
without anyone getting hurt.

32:31.383 --> 32:34.186
*

32:35.487 --> 32:38.124
(alarm blaring)

32:45.497 --> 32:46.999
Let's go.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.667
Let's go, people. Let's go!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.102
Gas is down.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.737
All right.

32:51.770 --> 32:54.773
Let's clear the rooms
and get in and out.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.475
Nick, go clear Ops.
Yes, sir.

32:59.378 --> 33:02.281
Go, go, go!

33:02.314 --> 33:04.283
Get out of the room.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.252
Everybody out.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.523
Ops is clear.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.092
Get Harris in there.

33:16.162 --> 33:19.131
(yells)

33:19.165 --> 33:20.566
Nick! What happened to Nick?

33:20.599 --> 33:22.068
Nick, where are you?
What happened?

33:22.101 --> 33:24.070
There's someone else
with a mask in here.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.105
(gasping)

33:26.672 --> 33:28.407
Kevin?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.409
(gun cocks)
Throw your weapon.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.811
You've got two guns
on you, Casey.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.812
Hey, guys!

33:33.845 --> 33:35.247
I'm on NZT.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.415
So is Casey.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.483
We're walking out of here.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.185
BRIAN:
We can figure
something out.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.386
Think about it, Casey.

33:40.419 --> 33:41.720
I'm sure you can see

33:41.753 --> 33:43.222
there are so many
paths to take,

33:43.255 --> 33:46.258
and if we just talk
through them together,

33:46.292 --> 33:50.196
and if everyone puts
their guns down!
Now!

33:50.229 --> 33:51.163
Final warning!

33:56.302 --> 33:57.769
WOMAN:
You do what you have to do.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.439
Yeah, yeah, okay,
I just have a situation here.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.408
I'll get out as soon as I can.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.344
But it might be closer to 8:00.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.478
WOMAN:
I told you.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.814
You have to be home
by 7:30 today.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.482
I have tickets to that show.
Oh, uh, okay.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.483
Very expensive.

34:11.517 --> 34:12.484
Okay, okay.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.819
I'll-I'll figure it out.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.154
I'll call you back.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.192
BRIAN: This is Brian.
Don't text back.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.394
Look on my shelves by the
counterintelligence files,

34:22.428 --> 34:25.331
right next to the Js.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.239
(alarm blaring)

34:37.176 --> 34:39.345
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

34:44.216 --> 34:45.584
Ops is clear.
Get Harris in there.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.789
(yells)

34:50.822 --> 34:53.259
What happened to Nick?
Nick, where are you?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.560
There's someone else
with a mask in here.

34:54.593 --> 34:56.128
(gasping)

34:56.162 --> 34:57.296
Kevin?

34:57.329 --> 34:59.131
(gun cocks)

34:59.165 --> 35:00.466
Throw your weapon!

35:00.499 --> 35:02.234
You've got two guns
on you, Casey!

35:02.268 --> 35:03.235
Hey, guys!

35:03.269 --> 35:04.703
I'm on NZT.

35:04.736 --> 35:05.704
So is Casey.

35:05.737 --> 35:06.705
We're walking out of here.

35:06.738 --> 35:07.806
We can figure
something out.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.476
Casey, put it down.
Now!

35:10.509 --> 35:11.543
BRIAN:
Think about it, Casey.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.146
I'm sure you can see
there are so many paths to take,

35:14.180 --> 35:17.316
and if we just
talk through them!

35:17.349 --> 35:19.218
Final warning!

35:47.213 --> 35:49.515
NAZ:
Boyle?

35:49.548 --> 35:52.218
Agent Boyle?

35:53.952 --> 35:56.355
What was your understanding
of the situation?

35:56.388 --> 35:59.191
There was no other alternative.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.228
Is that your understanding
as well, Agent Harris?

36:07.566 --> 36:10.869
Uh, I don't know.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.904
There was Brian.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.243
Finch had a gun
held to his head.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.176
Anything he was saying
was irrelevant.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.678
He seemed to think
there was another way.

36:19.711 --> 36:20.679
He was also high.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.981
He was on NZT.

36:23.014 --> 36:26.318
As was the agent
who started a hostage crisis

36:26.352 --> 36:29.321
in the middle of the FBI.

36:29.355 --> 36:31.523
I did what I was trained
to do in that situation

36:31.557 --> 36:33.925
to minimize the risk
of other casualties.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.627
One shot to the head.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.232
Can I go?

36:40.266 --> 36:41.500
I've given my statement.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.303
Have you?

36:44.336 --> 36:46.338
There was no other alternative.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.779
You did what you had to do.

37:00.652 --> 37:03.522
(door opens and closes)

37:03.555 --> 37:04.856
Go home.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.924
Get some rest.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.629
You did your job,
and you did it well.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.998
Don't second-guess that.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.282
(sighs)

37:35.954 --> 37:37.589
What are you
looking for?

37:37.623 --> 37:39.024
Uh, yeah, Naz said
Casey was carrying

37:39.057 --> 37:41.327
the rest of the NZT on him
when he went down.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.694
Forensics thinks
they dropped one of them

37:42.728 --> 37:44.696
out of his pocket when
they were moving the body.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.632
Right, well, could be anywhere.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.966
Could have gotten kicked.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.068
Hey, don't worry
about it.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.603
Just go home.

37:51.637 --> 37:52.804
I got it.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.974
Thanks.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.345
Have a good night.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.380
*

38:15.093 --> 38:17.396
You're early.

38:17.429 --> 38:18.730
Yeah.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.066
I, uh...

38:21.099 --> 38:23.068
Is everything okay?

38:23.101 --> 38:24.470
It was a good day.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.937
I left you something
on the stove.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.474
Oh... you are a saint.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.075
(chuckles)

38:30.108 --> 38:31.076
I'm beat.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.844
You work too hard.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.450
Good night.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.022
(knocking on door)

38:47.158 --> 38:48.994
Hey, did you
forget something?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.996
Hey, got your message.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.698
Come in.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.402
BOYLE:
I would have come to you,

38:56.435 --> 38:58.069
but I'm kind of stuck
here after 7:00.

38:58.103 --> 38:59.070
That's all right.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.071
Can I get you anything?

39:00.105 --> 39:01.407
No.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.774
Why'd you want
to see me?

39:04.776 --> 39:06.745
Well, it was something
Rebecca mentioned

39:06.778 --> 39:10.416
during the debriefing...
with Naz.

39:10.449 --> 39:12.751
She said that you thought

39:12.784 --> 39:14.753
there was another way
today could have gone down.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.755
When something traumatic
like that happens,

39:16.788 --> 39:20.025
we replay scenarios,
we search for other outcomes...

39:20.058 --> 39:21.760
I'd like to hear it.

39:21.793 --> 39:22.894
What's that?

39:22.928 --> 39:24.630
Those other outcomes.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.032
How, besides getting
yourself shot,

39:27.065 --> 39:29.100
today could have
gone down differently.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.974
I appreciate
what you did, Boyle,

39:36.007 --> 39:39.110
and I respect your training...

39:39.144 --> 39:40.912
But?

39:40.946 --> 39:42.581
...but if you would have
given me more time...

39:42.614 --> 39:43.915
To do what?

39:43.949 --> 39:45.050
Talk to Casey.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.585
To negotiate.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.587
You're not a negotiator, Brian.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.956
You're an untrained consultant
who sends real agents

39:50.989 --> 39:52.090
to get you sodas.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.625
All right, look, I know I need

39:53.659 --> 39:54.960
to show Mike and Ike
more respect,

39:54.993 --> 39:56.094
but I'm trying to do that.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.963
When are you gonna
start respecting me?

39:57.996 --> 40:00.131
When I'm on NZT,

40:00.165 --> 40:03.134
I can read a situation better
than anyone in the room, okay?

40:03.168 --> 40:05.671
I can think through
all the different angles,

40:05.704 --> 40:07.739
every perspective.

40:07.773 --> 40:08.974
Then shouldn't you
have known mine?

40:09.007 --> 40:10.742
How and when I'm trained
to use lethal force,

40:10.776 --> 40:11.977
that I was gonna shoot Casey?

40:12.010 --> 40:12.944
You texted me.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.746
Yeah, I... I didn't
think you'd shoot him.

40:14.780 --> 40:15.747
But I did.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.215
Well, you
shouldn't have.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.984
Casey was never
gonna fire.

40:19.017 --> 40:22.821
But when you pulled the trigger,
he had enough time to pull his.

40:22.854 --> 40:26.224
Instead,
he lowered his gun.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.560
That was the last
honorable thing he could do,

40:28.594 --> 40:31.162
and if you ask me,
he might have done it sooner--

40:31.196 --> 40:32.898
if you had given me more time.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.701
Like I said,

40:35.734 --> 40:38.169
it's not that I don't respect
the choice you made,

40:38.203 --> 40:42.073
it's just... because of NZT,

40:42.107 --> 40:44.576
I know there was
a better one.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.619

40:59.958 --> 41:04.596
* Come lay down your head
* All of my life

41:04.630 --> 41:07.733
* Rest in my arms
* I've been waiting

41:07.766 --> 41:13.705
* You're free tonight
* For you

41:16.074 --> 41:20.178
* Come lay down your head
* All of my life

41:20.211 --> 41:24.049
* Rest in my arms
* I've been waiting

41:24.082 --> 41:30.488
* You're free tonight
* For you

41:31.923 --> 41:36.261
* Come lay down your head
* All of my life

41:36.294 --> 41:41.032
* Rest in my arms
* I've been waiting

41:41.066 --> 41:46.171
* You're free tonight
* For you

41:48.206 --> 41:52.544
* Come lay down your head
* All of my life

41:52.578 --> 41:56.081
* Rest in my arms
* I've been waiting

41:56.114 --> 42:02.854
* You're free tonight
* For you.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.193

42:21.973 --> 42:25.010
(song fades)

42:26.311 --> 42:28.313

42:31.382 --> 42:33.218
Welcome back, Jason.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.220
Hey, good news, man.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.122
Naz says you're getting
a commendation.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.797
You know,

42:45.831 --> 42:48.199
I kind of got used to Ike.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.801
(both chuckle)

42:49.835 --> 42:51.036
(groans)

42:51.069 --> 42:52.370
(chuckling):
Oh, no.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.705
(chuckles)
Oh, no.

42:53.739 --> 42:54.940
Take it easy.

42:54.973 --> 42:57.242
(mumbles indistinctly)

42:57.275 --> 42:59.277
Yes.
