That's how you settled things.

15:29.168 --> 15:30.587
And if I'd have won,

15:31.170 --> 15:33.715
I'd have been la jefa.

15:33.798 --> 15:35.425
Instead of this.

15:37.093 --> 15:39.679
Thank God I got cancer.

15:40.346 --> 15:43.015
No one fucks with cancer.

16:09.793 --> 16:11.669
So it's nothing but lemonade?

16:12.211 --> 16:13.379
It's a cleanse.

16:13.463 --> 16:16.466
No vegetable juice? Fiber?

16:16.633 --> 16:19.051
We are going to deny
ourselves sustenance

16:19.135 --> 16:22.597
while there are people
that starve in Kinshasa?

16:25.642 --> 16:27.184
It's racist to
just say "Africa."

16:28.311 --> 16:29.729
You put cayenne pepper in this?

16:29.813 --> 16:33.149
Yes! Yes.
It flushes out toxins.

16:34.317 --> 16:37.487
We don't smoke,
we don't snort crack.

16:39.071 --> 16:41.407
Honey, don't you think the little
rocks would hurt your nose

16:41.491 --> 16:43.117
if you tried to snort crack?

16:43.660 --> 16:44.661
I think you mean coke.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.120
You know what I mean.

16:46.203 --> 16:49.165
You know, you don't let me buy
food unless it's locally-grown,

16:49.290 --> 16:51.292
grass-fed, conflict-free...

16:51.375 --> 16:53.336
I'm perfectly fine
doing this on my own.

No. No, no, no, no. Honey,
that's not what I'm saying.

16:55.672 --> 16:57.465
You're making fun of it.
No. I'm just...

16:57.548 --> 16:58.800
When you said cleanse,

16:58.883 --> 17:00.969
I thought you meant
we'd be eating more kale.

17:01.093 --> 17:03.805
We can eat more kale when we're
transitioning back to food.

17:03.930 --> 17:04.931
Okay.

17:05.556 --> 17:07.141

gonna do it together.

It's like fresh muffins.

28:27.530 --> 28:28.989
Dried blueberries.

28:29.114 --> 28:30.907
Twelve fuckin' pounds of 'em.

28:31.283 --> 28:34.537
Funnest hobby ever.
You seen my headphones?

28:34.662 --> 28:35.663
Uh, left drawer.

28:35.829 --> 28:37.109
So you can put
anything in there?

28:37.164 --> 28:38.207
Just about.

28:38.374 --> 28:41.751
Peppermint, basil,
grapefruits, vanilla.

28:41.877 --> 28:42.836

28:48.925 --> 28:50.365
You know, for Amy,
I think you'd want

28:50.386 --> 28:51.720
something more along the lines

28:51.845 --> 28:55.474
of sage, patchouli,
maybe eucalyptus?

28:55.849 --> 28:57.767
Oh, she's allergic
to eucalyptus,

28:57.893 --> 28:59.769
or she hates it.
I can't remember.

28:59.895 --> 29:01.055
Really? Who hates eucalyptus?

29:01.063 --> 29:03.857

they're "dirty trees."

You're still with that guy?

29:05.693 --> 29:06.860

You are still a lesbian.

29:18.747 --> 29:19.998

Okay.

29:23.711 --> 29:25.713
You could sell these, you know.
(DOOR CLOSES)

29:27.130 --> 29:30.426

little boutique stores.

29:30.634 --> 29:32.010

29:33.345 --> 29:34.597
I could be your partner.

29:35.264 --> 29:36.265

29:37.807 --> 29:39.685
This could be something.

29:39.768 --> 29:41.520

30:23.895 --> 30:24.980
What did she say to you?

30:25.147 --> 30:27.941
Not a word. I just know

43:06.782 --> 43:07.825
She's busy.

43:07.950 --> 43:09.452
This'll only take a second.

43:14.874 --> 43:16.418
For your back.

43:16.751 --> 43:18.461
It's jalapeno rub.

43:18.753 --> 43:19.962
I made it myself.

43:22.924 --> 43:24.384
The capsaicin in the peppers

43:24.467 --> 43:26.187
creates heat which is good
for sore muscles,

43:26.261 --> 43:28.930
and the cocoa butter
is gentle on the skin.

43:31.682 --> 43:35.270
We have a similar product in our
line and my dad swears by it.

43:35.395 --> 43:36.604
He's got sciatica.

43:36.729 --> 43:38.689
These are wrong.
They should say "March."

43:41.025 --> 43:42.193
You can go now.

43:47.282 --> 43:50.326
OFFICER: Count time
starts now. Count time!

43:50.452 --> 43:51.953
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

44:04.173 --> 44:05.383
Line it up. Stop the chatter.

44:11.514 --> 44:12.807
Count time!

44:17.061 --> 44:18.271
(CLICKING)

44:18.354 --> 44:19.647
Dorm A, one through 20.

44:33.286 --> 44:34.726
GUARD: Get that
garbage out of there.

44:39.375 --> 44:41.503
All good. Thank you, ladies.

44:49.511 --> 44:50.677
All good.

45:15.578 --> 45:18.581
COMMENTATOR ON TV: Wilson into left field.
Beautiful hit.

45:19.332 --> 45:21.750
...eludes one tackler.
And he's brought down hard.

45:21.876 --> 45:23.670
"One imagines
somewhere in an attic

45:23.878 --> 45:26.339
"there's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

45:26.422 --> 45:28.257
For a guy from Ad Age,
he can really write.

45:28.424 --> 45:30.092
ROGER: He also says
you're married.

45:30.301 --> 45:34.222
DON: Jesus. He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

45:34.347 --> 45:36.057
ROGER: You didn't
give him any facts.

45:36.182 --> 45:37.892
He had to make
some assumptions.

45:38.059 --> 45:42.021
My job is to write ads, not go
around talking about who I am.

45:42.146 --> 45:43.231
Who knows who you are?

45:43.314 --> 45:46.234
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

45:46.359 --> 45:47.569
DON: Why do you
have so many copies?

45:47.652 --> 45:48.819
ROGER: I bought one to read.

45:48.903 --> 45:50.823
And I was going to buy one
to frame in reception.

45:51.738 --> 45:53.908
CAPUTO: That new freezer
cost more than my car.

45:54.158 --> 45:56.160
Freon leak, huh?

45:56.244 --> 45:57.453
Most likely.

45:57.579 --> 46:01.416
You know, huffers, addicts.
Anything to get high.

46:02.667 --> 46:05.253
Anyone in here
huff that much Freon,

46:05.336 --> 46:07.922
we'd have a body
to show for it.

46:11.718 --> 46:14.887
Even you gotta know
when you're gettin' played.

46:16.055 --> 46:19.058
WOMAN OVER PA: Catholic, Buddhist,
Jewish and Muslim services

46:19.141 --> 46:22.103
will begin tomorrow
in the chapel at 9:00 a.m.

46:27.567 --> 46:29.776
(INMATES TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

46:37.243 --> 46:38.953
They said to give you this.

46:41.497 --> 46:45.460
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it worked?

46:45.585 --> 46:47.712
It must've worked.

46:47.794 --> 46:49.756
Your back cream?
Yeah.

46:49.838 --> 46:52.091
She said it burned, it made her
smell like a Puerto Rican,

46:52.174 --> 46:53.259
but you're good now.

46:53.342 --> 46:56.304
Everyone saw how hard you worked.
"A" for Effort.

46:57.388 --> 46:58.514
(CHUCKLES)

46:58.640 --> 46:59.682
Mmm.

47:01.850 --> 47:04.019
(CHUCKLES) It's not that good.

47:04.145 --> 47:05.396
Mmm-hmm.

47:09.651 --> 47:11.486
GINA: Next.
INMATE: Thank you.

47:21.996 --> 47:23.247
Next.

47:24.915 --> 47:26.000
What?

47:27.042 --> 47:28.169
Next.

47:39.806 --> 47:41.223
(DOOR OPENS)

47:42.433 --> 47:43.601
Hello?

47:58.282 --> 47:59.283
Put that in.

48:03.412 --> 48:04.455
(BOTH SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

48:04.580 --> 48:05.790
What's in those?

48:06.415 --> 48:07.583
You don't want to know.

48:08.584 --> 48:10.030
It's fine.

48:11.796 --> 48:13.595
This will make things
right for us.

48:13.715 --> 48:15.216
This doesn't feel right.

48:15.550 --> 48:16.801
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

48:18.803 --> 48:20.847
We're fine.
We'll work it out.

48:20.929 --> 48:21.930
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

48:22.056 --> 48:23.182
I promise.

48:32.734 --> 48:34.276
(ALL LAUGHING)

48:53.796 --> 48:55.130
Sorry.

49:51.896 --> 49:53.564
MAN ON TV: Have you
considered the possibility

49:53.648 --> 49:55.399
the reason you haven't been
laid in the last decade

49:55.483 --> 49:57.485
has something to do with your
routine use of the word "Trim"?

49:57.652 --> 50:01.656
Yeah, seven days a week,
56 weeks a year, "Trim!"

50:03.282 --> 50:04.283
That's my bad.

50:04.951 --> 50:06.823
Where's your manners, shithead?

50:23.344 --> 50:25.179
