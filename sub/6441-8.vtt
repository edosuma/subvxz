00:04.104 --> 00:06.402
All right, Ryan, what am I looking at?

00:10.010 --> 00:10.999
Ryan.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.706
A dog.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.614
What kind of dog?

00:16.783 --> 00:18.944
- A lab.
- What color is it?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.448
- What color?
- Brown.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.549
A tree.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.855
A pine tree.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:41.441 --> 00:42.806
Ryan.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.171
A father, mother and son.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.387
Another pressure headache?

00:55.655 --> 00:56.883
Let's try and push on.

00:57.257 --> 01:00.954
- I don't want to answer any more questions.
- There's just a few more left.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.519
Full moon.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.663
A butterfly.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.092
Train.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.901
You're afraid you're not gonna get
all your research done.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.467
Get some coagulant.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.766
Yes, doctor.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.203
What is it, Ryan?

01:55.915 --> 01:58.315
What's OxyContin?

01:58.718 --> 02:02.017
It's a very powerful narcotic. Why?

02:04.224 --> 02:06.192
He's stealing it.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.485
I knew it.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.026
I'll be right back.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.443
- What do you got there?
- The coagulant.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.844
It's what you asked for, right?

02:31.584 --> 02:34.747
Son of a... Son of a bitch!

02:36.556 --> 02:37.750
Ryan.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.887
Ryan?

03:12.225 --> 03:15.456
Ryan, open the door.

03:15.628 --> 03:18.256
Open the door now. Open up.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.862
Clark, can you get that?

03:24.704 --> 03:26.171
Yeah.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.109
- Hello?
- Clark, you gotta help me.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.802
Ryan, is that you?

03:34.147 --> 03:36.581
- You gotta get me out.
- Calm down. Where are you?

03:36.749 --> 03:40.048
A hospital called Summerholt.
Clark, you gotta get me out, please!

03:40.220 --> 03:41.744
Get in there.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.253
- Give me the phone.
- They're experimenting on me!

03:44.824 --> 03:47.224
- What?
- Let go, help! Clark! No!

03:51.564 --> 03:53.054
Ryan!

03:53.566 --> 03:58.401
I'll stop! Don't put that in me! Stop!
Let go! No! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

03:59.739 --> 04:01.172
I'm sorry!

05:07.807 --> 05:12.642
Ryan's aunt's phone has been disconnected.
The operator said there's no new listing.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.372
- It's like she disappeared.
- Doesn't make any sense.

05:15.548 --> 05:17.709
- What about this Summerholt?
- No, I checked.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.517
There's no hospital by that name
in Edge City.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.211
When did you last hear from Ryan?

05:22.388 --> 05:25.414
He sent an e-mail a few weeks ago.
He was getting ready for school.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.952
I'm calling the Edge City police.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.788
I've never heard him so scared.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.331
Maybe somebody's filed
a missing persons report.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.837
I keep thinking I missed something.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.775
Some clue in his e-mail,
some sign that things weren't okay.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.846
I guess I just wasn't listening.

05:49.015 --> 05:53.349
I know Ryan means a lot to you, Clark,
but you've gotta cut yourself some slack.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.349
Second-guessing isn't gonna help.

05:55.588 --> 05:59.422
Hey, remember that cute guy Henrik,
who works at the phone company?

05:59.592 --> 06:03.323
Yeah, you mean the Hungarian one
with the toy scooter?

06:03.496 --> 06:07.330
He's Austrian, and it's a classic Vespa,
but anyway...

06:07.500 --> 06:09.934
...he traced Ryan's call
back to its point of origin.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.434
You found something.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.567
Summerholt Neurological Institute.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.608
- It's not in Edge City, it's in Metropolis.
- That explains why we couldn't find it.

06:17.777 --> 06:22.043
The weird thing is that Summerholt is
a research facility. They don't take patients.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.513
And if they did, why would
Ryan be in lockdown...

06:24.684 --> 06:27.812
...in a place that specializes
in super-esoteric brain research?

06:35.261 --> 06:38.753
Mr. Mayor. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.559
Always a pleasure, Lex.
How can I help you?

06:41.734 --> 06:45.670
As you know, LexCorp is in the midst
of major plan expansion.

06:46.005 --> 06:49.202
But we're still awaiting final approval
from the zoning commission.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.304
Well, you know how it is these days, Lex.

06:52.478 --> 06:55.538
With all these environmental
and safety regulations.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.874
There's no such thing
as a rubber stamp anymore.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.381
If this project collapses,
it's gonna cost Smallville a lot of jobs.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.486
I've been friends with your father...

07:06.659 --> 07:10.117
...ever since LuthorCorp bought
the old creamed-corn plant.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.561
He was always a very generous supporter.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.964
I never realized my father had an interest
in local politics.

07:17.503 --> 07:22.202
I don't think he does. But I know he's never
had a permit held up at the commission.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.046
You want a bribe?

07:28.381 --> 07:30.372
I never said that.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.775
But now that you're running
your father's plant...

07:33.953 --> 07:36.114
...you should learn
how business gets done.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.280
Let's be clear.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.494
I don't work for my father anymore,
and it's not his plant. LexCorp owns it.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.722
And I have my own way of doing business.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.163
I'm up for re-election soon.
It's my fourth term.

07:51.337 --> 07:55.034
Think of this as the beginning of
a long-term relationship, which could have...

07:55.208 --> 07:58.507
...beneficial consequences for both of us.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.037
Call this man.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.876
He'll explain how things work.

08:07.954 --> 08:13.415
Oh, and imagine how much you'll lose
if construction shuts down.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.058
Hey.

08:24.737 --> 08:27.103
Hi. How was your ride?

08:27.273 --> 08:30.640
Oh, it was great. We took the long way
around Crater Lake.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.938
Do you remember riding at
the Metropolis Equestrian Center?

08:34.113 --> 08:37.082
And you said you wished you
belonged to a club like that?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.116
Yeah. They've got fantastic facilities.

08:40.686 --> 08:45.089
Well, what would you say if I told you
you could ride there every weekend...

08:45.258 --> 08:47.283
...and any time you wanted after school?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.826
I'd say it'd be a long drive.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.426
I know this is sudden.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.191
But...

08:55.768 --> 08:59.670
Well, Dean's taking a job in Metropolis,
and he wants us to move with him.

09:02.408 --> 09:03.807
And you said yes?

09:04.877 --> 09:07.209
I know it's a lot to ask, Lana.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.813
But it's important to Dean...

09:08.981 --> 09:13.111
...and I think it'll be a great opportunity
for you. It'll be great for all of us.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.712
I can't believe you agreed to do this
without even asking me.

09:18.724 --> 09:23.320
- I know it's difficult to imagine right now...
- What about school? And my friends?

09:23.496 --> 09:25.623
Not to mention the Talon.

09:25.798 --> 09:28.323
Lana, you can visit Smallville
any time you want.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.280
This Summerholt Institute has
more bureaucracy than the IRS.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.385
I was on hold for an hour before
they told me to call tomorrow.

09:47.853 --> 09:49.445
I want to go and check it out.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.557
The police have been there,
and there was no sign of Ryan.

09:52.858 --> 09:56.555
- This might not even be the place.
- Ryan's like a little brother to me.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.254
If something happened to him,
I'd never forgive myself.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.899
We understand how you feel.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.696
But you can't just go and start
ripping the doors off this place.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.811
His name is Ryan James.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.388
I told you, we have no one here
by that name.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.721
- I know he's here.
- Lf you don't leave, I'll call security.

10:28.894 --> 10:30.794
I want to talk to someone in charge.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.022
- Mary, is there a problem?
- Dr. Garner.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.793
This man believes we have
a friend of his here.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.869
It's okay, I'll handle it. Dr. Garner.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.260
Clark Kent.

10:40.439 --> 10:43.465
- Kent. Did your parents call earlier?
- Yeah.

10:43.676 --> 10:47.908
We're looking for our friend Ryan James.
He called and said he was being held here.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.640
There's been a mistake.
We're a research facility.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.613
I know he's here.

10:53.719 --> 10:56.210
Don't take my word for it,
talk to the police.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.323
They came by and checked. Twice.

10:58.858 --> 11:02.021
I wish I could help you,
but your friend isn't here.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.728
I hope you find him.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.642
- Ryan.
- Clark?

11:33.259 --> 11:35.750
Hey. You're not supposed to be in here.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.701
It's okay, we'll get you out of here.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.330
- Here you go.
- I knew you'd come for me.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.284
Here you go, Ryan.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.415
How you doing?

12:04.590 --> 12:07.218
Okay. Thanks to Clark.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.658
Ryan, do you have any idea how we can
get ahold of your aunt?

12:12.364 --> 12:13.991
I think she moved to Arizona.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.566
How could she just leave you?

12:17.903 --> 12:20.838
A few months ago, I started getting
nosebleeds and headaches.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.539
She took me to doctors,
but no one knew what the problem was.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.907
The bills were becoming too much
for her to handle...

12:28.647 --> 12:31.411
Then Dr. Garner showed up
and offered to pay for my care.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.710
Ryan, what were they treating you for?

12:38.324 --> 12:40.121
They were...

12:40.359 --> 12:43.817
- They were treating me...
- They were holding him for observation.

12:45.464 --> 12:48.126
Clark, can I talk to you for a moment?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.760
Clark?

12:53.072 --> 12:54.869
Yeah?

12:58.477 --> 12:59.944
Never mind.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.846
Get some rest, okay?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.523
I appreciate you taking Ryan in.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.186
If I took him home,
my parents would have freaked.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.129
Yeah, kidnapping has that effect on people.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.896
Why did you break him out if they
were only keeping him for observation?

13:26.071 --> 13:28.130
Look, I didn't have a choice.

13:28.307 --> 13:32.767
- They were treating him like a lab rat.
- Clark, you abducted a minor.

13:32.945 --> 13:36.312
They'll trace him to you and me.
We're in serious trouble here.

13:38.517 --> 13:42.283
I shouldn't have involved you.
I'll find someplace else to hide him.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.289
Ryan's staying here.
At least for tonight.

13:45.457 --> 13:49.393
Tomorrow I'll talk to my lawyers,
see what our options are.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.252
I'm sorry.

13:51.430 --> 13:54.922
I didn't think it through. I saw him
hooked to wires, I had to do something.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.728
So you staged a one-man prison break?

13:59.305 --> 14:03.036
How did you manage to get him out
without anybody stopping you?

14:04.777 --> 14:06.711
Just lucky, I guess.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.348
You're the luckiest guy I've ever met.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.782
Let's hope it doesn't run out
before tomorrow.

14:23.329 --> 14:24.887
Mom?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.761
Hey, Dad.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.338
What's going on?

14:34.506 --> 14:36.337
Where's Ryan?

14:36.809 --> 14:39.676
- He's safe from you.
- Clark, what did you do?

14:41.113 --> 14:44.105
Sheriff, search every inch of this farm.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.641
Wait, you can't do that.

14:47.019 --> 14:50.614
- They have a search warrant.
- Place him under arrest for kidnapping.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.279
What?

14:52.691 --> 14:55.854
Look. Give me till tomorrow morning.

14:57.029 --> 15:01.932
I don't know how you got him out of
Summerholt, but if he's not here by 9 a. M...

15:02.101 --> 15:07.368
...federal marshals will be crawling all over,
and your life is going under the microscope.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.012
Ryan. Hi.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.348
Hi, Ryan.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.818
Mr. Kent.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.123
Please don't be mad at Clark,
he was trying to help me.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.730
I know that, Ryan.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.135
You should've seen the way
he threw that orderly.

15:42.308 --> 15:46.404
- He must have weighed, like, 300 pounds.
- No, he's exaggerating. A little.

15:48.213 --> 15:51.148
Look, Ryan, we're glad
that you're okay, but...

15:52.217 --> 15:55.812
...Clark did go about this the wrong way.
I'm afraid that we don't have...

15:55.988 --> 15:58.786
...much of a choice but to give you back.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.594
How did you end up in Summerholt?

16:06.265 --> 16:09.996
Dr. Garner told my aunt that there was
something wrong with my brain.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.961
That's why I can read minds.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.569
She found out about my ability,
it just freaked her out.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.672
Ryan, I'm so sorry.

16:18.844 --> 16:22.837
She's not a bad person, she just couldn't
accept that I was different.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.921
They're here.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.327
Hello, Ryan.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.534
Please don't let him take me.

16:44.703 --> 16:50.608
Dr. Garner's agreed to drop the kidnapping
charges if you turn over the boy.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.336
Come on, Ryan, we need to get back
to Metropolis.

16:56.215 --> 16:59.946
I'm Ryan's legal guardian,
and I have the paperwork denoting such...

17:00.119 --> 17:01.211
...please do your job.

17:01.387 --> 17:06.619
Having custody of a child is not the same
thing as having a pink slip to a car.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.784
Can't you see he doesn't want
to go with you?

17:10.194 --> 17:11.719
Ethan, please.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.996
The choice is yours, Mr. And Mrs. Kent.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.829
You can lose one boy here today,
or both of them.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.968
I believe kidnapping comes
with some juvenile time.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.372
I'm sorry, folks, but...

17:34.086 --> 17:35.610
Sheriff.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.319
Before you do anything...

17:38.991 --> 17:40.686
...take a look at this.

17:41.660 --> 17:46.188
It's a restraining order giving the Kents
custody until the situation can be reviewed.

17:46.365 --> 17:50.529
You want to try a judicial roadblock?
You go ahead. I'll have Clark arrested.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.731
You could, but I have a countersuit
ready to be filed.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.365
Metropolis DA is very interested in
Summerholt's research practices...

17:58.811 --> 18:01.439
...especially involving minors
held under duress.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.844
Your move, doctor.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.918
This isn't over.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.587
Your rich friend saved you today, Clark.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.628
Sheriff.

18:33.145 --> 18:35.409
Surprise!

18:36.081 --> 18:37.639
It's your jailbreak party.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.876
We even have the obligatory
pistachio log ice cream cake...

18:41.053 --> 18:43.988
...and we managed to rustle up a band.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.124
This is so cool. Thanks, guys.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.759
Good to see you, man.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.161
I'm so glad you're back.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.801
Yeah, me too.

19:01.773 --> 19:04.264
You knew about this
the whole time, didn't you?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.803
- Half a block away.
- Yeah.

19:07.746 --> 19:11.944
- Thanks for not ruining the surprise.
- I was tempted to. I hate pistachio.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.253
But it was definitely worth the kiss.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.846
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Pete. Tell your mom thanks.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.877
- Thanks for what?
- She cosigned the restraining order.

19:47.052 --> 19:50.283
Imagine getting a call from Lex Luthor
at 5 in the morning?

19:52.124 --> 19:54.149
Hey, Pete. Come here a second.

19:56.962 --> 20:00.728
- Pete knows your secret.
- Yeah, I know, I told him. It's all right.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.292
- Did you know he's stressed out about it?
- No.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.767
- Why?
- He's worried one day he'll slip up and tell.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.635
Then they'll lock you up
in a place like Summerholt.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.907
Brought you guys a couple of pieces
before everyone eats it all.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.254
Hey, what's wrong?

20:25.290 --> 20:29.056
- Just a headache.
- I'll go get you a glass of water.

20:29.928 --> 20:31.919
You sure you're okay?

20:34.366 --> 20:35.765
Clark.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.600
Lana's moving to Metropolis.

20:56.388 --> 21:00.017
Hey, Clark, got your message.
Is everything okay?

21:00.225 --> 21:01.214
Yeah.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.161
I just wanted to thank you for the party.
It was really great.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.762
Sorry we left early,
Ryan wasn't feeling so good.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.924
Yeah, how's he doing?
He didn't look so hot.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.332
To be honest, I'm not really sure.

21:12.504 --> 21:16.998
He's got a doctor's appointment tomorrow
to try to figure out what they did to him.

21:17.309 --> 21:19.675
You should have seen him, Lana.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.609
But he's safe now, thanks to you.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.846
Yeah, he's just such a good kid.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.680
Seems like life's always
kicking him in the teeth.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.152
Makes you realize how lucky we are.

21:35.994 --> 21:41.626
- You okay? You seem a little preoccupied.
- Oh, no. No, I'm fine.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.459
Things aren't as solid between us
as they used to be...

21:45.637 --> 21:49.767
...but I'm still here for you
if you want to talk about anything.

21:53.745 --> 21:58.148
Nell and Dean are moving to Metropolis,
and I'm supposed to go with them.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.319
How do you feel about that?

22:03.789 --> 22:06.986
How would you feel if you were uprooted
and sent somewhere far away...

22:07.159 --> 22:09.354
...where you didn't know anyone?

22:10.095 --> 22:11.653
I think it'd be really tough.

22:13.965 --> 22:17.059
I feel like a piece of luggage
they want to throw in the trunk...

22:17.235 --> 22:19.965
...as they drive off to their new life.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.106
Have you talked to Henry Small
about this?

22:24.276 --> 22:26.608
No, I'm not ready to dump this in his lap.

22:26.778 --> 22:30.270
Just because we might share the same DNA
does not mean we're family.

22:33.251 --> 22:37.017
Well, you can come stay with us.
It's just kind of crowded right now.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.851
Ryan's lucky.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.559
At least he got to choose his family.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.364
I'll see you later.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.239
Don't go.

23:00.846 --> 23:03.178
Don't go to Metropolis.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.942
Or what? You gonna kidnap me too?

23:07.152 --> 23:10.144
Nell shouldn't be able to dictate your life
without your input.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.120
If moving doesn't feel right, don't go.

23:25.537 --> 23:28.028
Mr. Luthor's in Metropolis
so I won't be long...

23:28.206 --> 23:30.470
...and then we'll get you to the doctor.

23:30.642 --> 23:34.976
You pretend around Mr. Kent
you don't like your job. But you do.

23:36.648 --> 23:40.778
Now that you're in our lives, I may
give it up to spend more time with you.

23:41.052 --> 23:43.418
- I don't want to be a problem.
- Ryan.

23:44.022 --> 23:46.855
You are a gift. Like Clark.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.091
I know your secret.

23:53.732 --> 23:56.428
Why don't you tell Mr. Kent and Clark?
They'd want to know.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.798
I will, when the time is right,
but in the meantime...

23:59.971 --> 24:02.235
- I promise, my lips are sealed.
- Thank you.

24:02.407 --> 24:03.567
Ryan.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.506
- Hi, Lex.
- Hey, how you feeling?

24:06.678 --> 24:10.876
- Much better. Thanks again for...
- Harboring you? My pleasure.

24:11.049 --> 24:14.018
- I'd better get to work.
- See you.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.711
So can I check out that
Warrior Angel collection?

24:17.055 --> 24:19.819
That depends. Your hands clean?

24:25.564 --> 24:29.762
Warrior Angel, number one, mint condition.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.930
I had two copies of every issue.
One for the collection...

24:33.104 --> 24:35.231
And one for reading.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.939
Why do you like Warrior Angel so much?

24:38.109 --> 24:40.976
Helped me through some tough times
when I was younger.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.239
After your mom died?

24:44.549 --> 24:46.574
How did you know that?

24:49.054 --> 24:50.817
Clark told me.

24:54.359 --> 24:59.023
The world between these glossy covers
was reassuring.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.564
You knew who the heroes and villains were.
When you grow up...

25:02.801 --> 25:05.031
...you learn that not everything's
black and white.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.637
So now all you see is shades of gray?

25:08.807 --> 25:10.468
Ryan.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.667
Real life is not a comic book.

25:12.944 --> 25:16.471
Sometimes you have to get
your hands dirty, make compromises.

25:17.482 --> 25:20.781
That's what your father told you.
That doesn't mean he's right.

25:23.288 --> 25:26.018
You are either remarkably intuitive or...

25:30.362 --> 25:31.795
Ryan?

25:33.832 --> 25:35.800
Ryan, what's wrong?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.505
It's so loud.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.668
Hey, buddy, how's your head?

26:14.172 --> 26:16.436
Still hurts a little.

26:22.380 --> 26:26.077
- The newest issue.
- Yeah, they had it at the gift shop.

26:28.053 --> 26:32.752
- So, what's up with the floating balloon?
- It's Warrior Angel's aerodrome.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.189
A floating fortress where he can get away
from his troubles.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.329
Sounds like something
everyone should have.

26:38.496 --> 26:41.090
- Not sure about the floating part though.
- Why not?

26:44.169 --> 26:46.899
I have this little fear of flying.

26:47.272 --> 26:51.675
- I didn't think you were scared of anything.
- There's a lot of things I'm scared of.

26:51.843 --> 26:53.640
Guess I just put on a brave face.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.642
Yeah.

26:57.148 --> 26:58.581
Me too.

27:02.153 --> 27:04.553
My parents said the doctors
are gonna run more tests.

27:04.789 --> 27:09.283
They don't need to, I know what's wrong
with me. I read Dr. Garner's mind.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.385
What is it?

27:13.765 --> 27:16.233
There's a tumor in my head, Clark.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.432
- It's getting bigger.
- I'll tell the doctors.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.162
They know.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.083
I'm dying, Clark.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.116
And no one can save me.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.274
Clark.

28:08.253 --> 28:12.087
- We're going to the hospital, wanna come?
- Is there any news?

28:16.628 --> 28:20.587
Son, the tumor is growing
at an accelerated rate.

28:20.765 --> 28:25.031
The doctors think it's probably due
to the experiments that were done on Ryan.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.410
This is Ryan's.

28:33.578 --> 28:35.045
He thinks I'm a hero.

28:36.548 --> 28:40.814
- Hey, you've helped a whole lot of people.
- I can't help Ryan.

28:40.986 --> 28:44.285
- What kind of hero is that?
- Listen...

28:44.523 --> 28:48.550
...this thing is beyond
even your ability, son.

28:48.727 --> 28:52.219
The doctors are doing everything
that they can. We...

28:52.397 --> 28:54.388
...have to pray for the best.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.729
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and watch Ryan die?

28:57.903 --> 29:00.872
- No. Nobody's asking you to do that, Clark.
- Good.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.569
Because I'm not gonna give up.

29:13.618 --> 29:18.146
"Facts on child emancipation." I have
a feeling this isn't for a research paper.

29:18.323 --> 29:22.259
I decided to tell Nell that I wasn't
moving with her to Metropolis.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.225
Well, that's very Erin Brockovich of you.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.728
How did Nell take it?

29:26.932 --> 29:32.268
One, she's my legal guardian,
two, I'm a teenager, and three:

29:33.171 --> 29:37.301
- I don't have any say in the matter.
- That pretty much covers all your bases.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.466
Are you gonna pursue
the emancipation thing?

29:39.644 --> 29:42.977
It could take up to a year and a half
to complete the process.

29:43.148 --> 29:46.447
- Sounds like you're talking yourself out of it.
- It's my last shot.

29:49.487 --> 29:52.945
You know, you might have
one other option.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.755
This is the man you want to talk to.

29:59.931 --> 30:04.300
He's developed a radical new serum
that shrinks primary brain tumors.

30:04.569 --> 30:07.231
- It's experimental.
- How can I get in touch with him?

30:07.405 --> 30:08.394
That's the problem.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.804
His office in Hub City said he's flying
to Helsinki this afternoon...

30:11.977 --> 30:13.569
...he won't be back for six weeks.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.513
By that time, it'll be too late.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.876
Clark.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.143
When I was looking into Ryan's condition...

30:21.319 --> 30:25.016
...I found that some scientists
think the type of tumor he has...

30:25.190 --> 30:28.216
...can give a person ESP-like abilities.
- What are you saying?

30:28.393 --> 30:30.486
Ryan is unnervingly insightful.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.096
I think he may be able to read
people's minds.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.932
Are you even interested in helping Ryan?
Or just exploiting him too?

30:37.102 --> 30:40.435
I just spent three hours on the phone
tracking this doctor down.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.129
What do you think?

30:42.707 --> 30:43.799
I'm sorry.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.671
I understand what you're going through,
but sometimes...

30:46.845 --> 30:50.611
...no matter how much you want to save
someone, there's nothing you can do.

30:56.054 --> 30:57.817
I'm not gonna let Ryan down.

30:58.123 --> 31:02.617
When my mother got sick, I spent my time
researching doctors and treatments.

31:02.794 --> 31:06.525
But the most important thing I could
have done was spend time with her.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.197
By the time I realized that,
it was too late.

31:11.236 --> 31:16.538
I wasn't at her side when she passed,
Clark. Don't make the same mistake I did.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.445
I'm not gonna let him die, Lex.

31:50.408 --> 31:51.966
Hey.

31:52.143 --> 31:53.770
Brought you some comics.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.312
- Clark beat you to it.
- Yeah?

31:57.649 --> 32:00.311
Well, I bet he didn't bring you number 66.

32:01.352 --> 32:02.614
That's the rarest issue.

32:02.787 --> 32:06.154
It's the one where Devilicus
turned against Warrior Angel.

32:06.357 --> 32:09.258
- Weren't they best friends?
- Once upon a time.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.058
What happened to them?

32:12.497 --> 32:16.490
Well, they ruled the Guardian Realm
together...

32:17.035 --> 32:19.230
...until Devilicus told Warrior Angel...

32:19.404 --> 32:22.601
...that they should join forces
and conquer humanity.

32:23.875 --> 32:28.312
Together, no one would be able
to stop them.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.916
- What did Warrior Angel say?
- He refused.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.849
He believed it was a hero's sacred duty
to protect those weaker than himself.

32:36.221 --> 32:40.954
Devilicus thought he was naive and vowed
to destroy him and everything he stood for.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.565
Why do you think Devilicus went bad?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.159
I'm not sure.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.332
Probably wasn't aware of it.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.336
You see, Ryan...

32:56.508 --> 32:59.773
...in life, the road to darkness
is a journey...

32:59.944 --> 33:01.741
...not a light switch.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.584
You should remember that, Lex.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.083
- Excuse me, have you seen Dr. Burton?
- Who?

33:41.252 --> 33:42.378
This guy, right here.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.250
You just missed him, kid. Right there.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.351
Wait!

33:53.965 --> 33:55.694
- Wait!
- Who is that?

33:59.771 --> 34:01.204
Dr. Burton!

34:01.372 --> 34:03.897
- What are you doing? Who are you?
- I'm Clark Kent.

34:04.075 --> 34:07.442
My friend is really sick. Would you
take a look at these scans?

34:08.313 --> 34:11.748
Doctor, please, by the time you get back,
it'll be too late.

34:11.916 --> 34:14.714
- Get your hands in the air now!
- Doctor, please.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.647
- I said, hands in the air now!
- Wait a second.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.297
Where's your friend now?

34:35.672 --> 34:37.902
Mom, Dad, when's Ryan
gonna be out of surgery?

34:38.076 --> 34:40.976
- In a couple of hours.
- Clark...

34:42.213 --> 34:45.649
...I don't think I've ever been
as proud of you as I am right now.

34:45.817 --> 34:49.411
Your mother's right, son.
It was an amazing thing that you did.

34:49.687 --> 34:53.521
But I hope you understand that even though
you did get Dr. Burton here...

34:53.690 --> 34:57.149
...Ryan isn't necessarily out of the woods.
- I know it's no guarantee...

34:57.328 --> 35:00.786
...but I think it's gonna work.
I have a great feeling about it.

35:04.302 --> 35:06.167
Over the past 12 years...

35:06.371 --> 35:11.206
...thirty-two city contracts have been
awarded to firms with ties to Mayor Tate.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.376
His sweetheart deals have
endangered our environment...

35:14.545 --> 35:17.776
...and harmed businesses trying to compete
on an uneven playing field.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.512
Can Smallville really afford
another four years of Mayor Tate?

35:24.222 --> 35:26.315
Why are you doing this?

35:27.392 --> 35:30.589
Smallville needs an honest mayor.

35:30.995 --> 35:33.623
- Are you planning on running?
- No.

35:33.798 --> 35:37.029
But I'm putting my support and money
behind your opponent.

35:37.201 --> 35:41.103
You'd save yourself a lot of trouble
by announcing your retirement now.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.439
You can kiss that plant expansion goodbye.

35:44.609 --> 35:46.702
I will see that it never gets approval.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.574
I'm prepared to sacrifice it to defeat you.

35:49.747 --> 35:53.012
You know, you're not from here.
People don't like you.

35:53.384 --> 35:54.817
Don't laugh at me.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.647
All it'll take are some fiery campaign
speeches about outside interests...

35:58.823 --> 36:02.486
...controlling this community
and you'll start to feel the heat.

36:04.329 --> 36:08.265
When Winston Churchill heard
about the attack on Pearl Harbor...

36:08.933 --> 36:13.768
...he broke out a bottle of champagne
and said, "We've won the war."

36:14.172 --> 36:17.300
His generals looked at him
like he'd lost his mind.

36:17.475 --> 36:20.035
America's Pacific Fleet was wiped out...

36:20.211 --> 36:24.238
...France was overrun and the Luftwaffe
was bombing London.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.844
Churchill said America is like a giant boiler.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.551
Light a fire under it...

36:32.724 --> 36:35.818
...and there's no limit to the amount
of heat it can generate.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.928
If you start a fire, Mayor Tate...

36:38.930 --> 36:41.797
...you'd better be prepared
to deal with the flames.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.277
Clark.

36:54.445 --> 36:56.379
- Hey, Lana.
- Is there any news?

36:56.581 --> 36:59.550
Ryan's still in recovery,
but Dr. Burton is optimistic.

36:59.784 --> 37:02.981
- Everything's gonna work out.
- Yeah, I think it is.

37:03.287 --> 37:04.982
Oh, by the way, I took your advice.

37:05.156 --> 37:09.650
Chloe and her dad have offered to let me
stay with them until I finish high school.

37:10.094 --> 37:14.622
- And Nell's cool with that?
- Not really, but she's agreed to it.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.600
Well, I knew you were a fighter.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.132
It's scary...

37:19.370 --> 37:22.737
...but then I think of Ryan
and everything that he's gone through.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.898
It kind of puts things in perspective.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.743
You and Chloe as roommates.

37:29.080 --> 37:33.016
- Did you ever see that coming?
- Not in a million years.

37:36.687 --> 37:38.917
What is it?

37:39.390 --> 37:41.153
Nothing.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.322
It's just you won't be
the girl next door anymore.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.922
I'm not going anywhere, Clark.

37:51.302 --> 37:54.237
Maybe now you can give
your telescope to Ryan.

38:03.981 --> 38:05.209
Mom?

38:07.385 --> 38:09.353
Clark.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.831
What you reading, buddy?

38:28.539 --> 38:30.598
The infamous aerodrome, huh?

38:32.710 --> 38:35.770
Every year for my birthday,
I'd wish for my own aerodrome.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.476
So I could fly high above the Earth.

38:40.985 --> 38:44.148
Up there all my problems would seem
so small and far away.

38:44.889 --> 38:48.052
It's a good idea except for the flying part.

38:50.361 --> 38:52.886
This is one of Lex's favorites.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.190
- Would you give it back to him?
- No, you give it to him.

38:57.034 --> 38:58.797
When you get out of here.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.232
I know I said
you should be careful of Lex.

39:06.410 --> 39:09.538
But I never told you how much
he admires you.

39:10.314 --> 39:12.805
Promise me you'll keep an eye
on him after I'm gone.

39:12.984 --> 39:16.215
Ryan. Don't talk like that, all right?
You're not going anywhere.

39:16.420 --> 39:19.082
- Clark.
- Look, you don't just give up hope.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.749
- There's more doctors we can see.
- You're not listening to me.

39:23.027 --> 39:26.190
The doctor said you bought me
a few extra days.

39:27.632 --> 39:30.430
I want to spend that time
with my friend.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.674
Ryan, what's wrong?

39:42.547 --> 39:44.071
Ryan.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.783
- Ryan, what's wrong?
- It's so loud in here.

39:53.624 --> 39:57.060
All right, look. I'll take you
somewhere quiet, all right?

40:16.447 --> 40:18.176
What do you think?

40:18.349 --> 40:20.510
It's peaceful.

40:21.219 --> 40:24.017
I thought you were afraid of flying.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.247
Not when I have you here to protect me.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.722
Thanks, Clark.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.220
For what?

40:33.397 --> 40:35.194
This moment.

40:36.133 --> 40:37.794
It's perfect.

40:43.874 --> 40:46.934
I don't want you to be angry or sad.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.740
You changed my life.

40:51.249 --> 40:54.514
You're gonna change
a lot of people's lives, Clark.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.113
Promise me you'll never give up.

41:01.759 --> 41:03.954
I promise.
