00:02.470 --> 00:05.724
- Previously on Hannibal...
- You're full of surprises, D.
They find you very mysterious.

00:05.770 --> 00:09.308
- I am delighted that you have
taken an interest in me.

00:09.340 --> 00:13.538
I want to be recognized by you.
- See how magnificent you are.

00:13.580 --> 00:18.301
- The man who killed the Jacobis
and the Leedses chose them.
I have to believe there is

00:18.350 --> 00:22.343
a common factor.
- Are you familiar with William
Blake's The Great Red Dragon?

00:22.390 --> 00:25.780
- You know, you're the second
person who's asked to see
the Blake today.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.187
- (Hannibal): As the dragon
grows in strength and glory,
there are families to come.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.119
- So whatever he says he wants
to do, you'll take him anyway.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.027
- (Jack): I promise I'll try to
make it as easy on him as I can.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.608
- (Will): He ate a painting.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.631
- He ate it?

00:47.680 --> 00:49.648
- He ate it up.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.671
The Art Squad in New York
snapped to it

00:51.710 --> 00:53.644
when they found out what he ate.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.615
- They pulled
two partial prints

00:56.650 --> 00:58.743
from the plastic pass he used.
No ID,

00:58.790 --> 01:01.588
but it's still the same thumb
that was on Mrs. Leeds' eye.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.657
- What about the docent
at the museum?

01:04.690 --> 01:07.090
- He had a sweet touch with her.
She had to have, uh,

01:07.130 --> 01:09.325
four stitches.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.429
Mild concussion,
but he didn't kill her.

01:11.470 --> 01:15.588
- Why?
- He'd have been
better off killing her

01:15.640 --> 01:19.701
and you.
- Maybe he's trying to stop.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.540
- You think there's a way
to push him to being
self-destructive?

01:23.580 --> 01:26.777
- You mean push him
towards suicide?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.812
- Suicide suits me just fine.

01:29.850 --> 01:33.889
- If he's really trying to stop,
he's not going to kill himself.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.552
How could he be sure his death
would affect whatever's
inside him?

01:39.600 --> 01:43.297
- You must know something about
him otherwise you wouldn't
have found him.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.532
- Jack Crawford,

01:49.570 --> 01:51.902
fisher of men,

01:51.940 --> 01:54.170
watching my cork

01:54.210 --> 01:57.805
move against the current.

01:57.850 --> 02:01.342
You got me again.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.515
Hannibal told me
where to find him.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.655
He knows.

02:13.630 --> 02:16.190
He knows who the Dragon is.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.133
He probably treated him.

02:30.750 --> 02:34.641
- It stunned me
the first time I saw it.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.682
- Like Blake peeked
in your ear and saw

02:36.720 --> 02:39.609
the Red Dragon there.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.720
Coiled inside you,
coiled around you.

02:42.760 --> 02:47.550
This new twoness with the Dragon
is disorienting for you.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.626
- Our wills were one.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.966
But not now.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.935
Not since her.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.940
(slashing sound)
(moaning)

03:04.550 --> 03:06.472
The Dragon

03:06.520 --> 03:10.388
has never spoken to me before.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.681
It was frightening.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.928
- What did it say?

03:17.960 --> 03:22.727
- It called my name.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.989
It wants her.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.807
- If it weren't for
the power of your Becoming,

03:32.840 --> 03:36.947
if it weren't for the Dragon,
you could never have had her.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.676
- I...

03:39.720 --> 03:43.019
...put my hand

03:43.050 --> 03:46.781
on her beating heart.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.294
Heard the sound of her...

03:53.330 --> 03:55.525
...living voice.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.669
A...

03:59.700 --> 04:04.262
...living woman.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.369
How bizarre.

04:15.450 --> 04:19.352
I don't want to give her

04:19.390 --> 04:22.018
to the Dragon.
- The Dragon is in your

04:22.060 --> 04:24.688
belly now.
...You can choose

04:24.730 --> 04:26.698
to have her alive.
You don't have to worry about

04:26.730 --> 04:29.494
feeling love for her.

04:29.530 --> 04:33.466
You can always
toss the Dragon someone else.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.401
(heart beating)

04:46.650 --> 04:49.448
- Will Graham

04:49.490 --> 04:51.446
interests me.

04:51.490 --> 04:55.608
Odd-looking
for an investigator.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.026
Not very handsome,

04:58.060 --> 05:01.552
but. . .purposeful.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.320
- He has a family.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.440
(exhaHng)

05:15.480 --> 05:18.745
Save yourself.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.115
Kill them all.

05:26.150 --> 05:28.710
(theme music playing)

06:20.540 --> 06:23.407
(soft click)

06:23.450 --> 06:26.078
(tense music)

07:09.660 --> 07:12.493
(aggressive music)

07:22.170 --> 07:24.502
(Clair de Lune
by Debussy playing)

07:35.150 --> 07:37.141
- I have a little homework.

07:39.690 --> 07:42.625
- Sure. If I'm keeping you
from working,

07:42.660 --> 07:44.651
I can go.

07:44.690 --> 07:47.796
- No.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.765
I want you

07:50.800 --> 07:53.598
to be here.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.234
I do.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.807
I have some film

08:00.840 --> 08:04.071
that I need to check.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.249
It won't take long.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.078
- Does it have
a soundtrack?

08:11.590 --> 08:13.558
- No.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.808
- May I keep the music?

08:15.860 --> 08:18.749
- Uh-huh.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.896
- I think I'll just
stretch out here

08:21.930 --> 08:24.592
for a few minutes,
if you don't mind.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.190
No, don't move.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.903
I have plenty of room.

08:30.940 --> 08:34.637
Hmm? Wake me up if I drop off.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.215
(whirring quietly)

08:59.300 --> 09:02.667
- Are these your
nocturnal animals?

09:02.710 --> 09:06.259
- Uh-huh.

09:06.310 --> 09:09.609
- Think they know
they're being filmed?

09:11.610 --> 09:13.646
- No.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.913
(ominous music)

09:42.810 --> 09:45.870
(running footsteps)
- Mom!

09:45.910 --> 09:49.641
- What?
- Mom! Something's
wrong with the dogs.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.860
- They may have gotten into
something they shouldn't have.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.118
Has there been _
any changes In their diet?

10:08.300 --> 10:12.009
- My husband usually
makes their food from scratch,

10:12.040 --> 10:14.679
but he's out of town
and it's a lot of work

10:14.710 --> 10:17.008
so I've been feeding them
canned food.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.972
- Was it canned food
made in China?

10:19.010 --> 10:22.218
- Is it bad to be made in China?
- If you're pet food.

10:22.250 --> 10:26.653
Dogs get poisoned by Chinese
pet food all the time.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.887
- Are the dogs going to die?
- No, they're not gonna--

10:29.930 --> 10:32.899
Are the dogs gonna die?
- No. I mean, you got
them here really fast

10:32.930 --> 10:36.354
and the activated charcoal
should soak up whatever's
in their system.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.324
It would help though if you
could bring me a sample

10:39.370 --> 10:41.429
of whatever it is they've been
eating so we can run some tests.

10:41.470 --> 10:44.064
- I'll bring it by tomorrow.
- OK, in the meantime,

10:44.110 --> 10:46.066
we'll keep the dogs here
overnight and we'll monitor

10:46.110 --> 10:48.078
their recovery.
They should be fine.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.840
- Thank you.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.173
(sighing)

10:55.220 --> 10:57.245
- Are you going
to tell Dad?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.212
- Um...

10:59.250 --> 11:02.879
You know how I always said
that secrets were bad

11:02.930 --> 11:05.148
and you shouldn't
keep secrets?

11:05.190 --> 11:07.249
I have an amendment to that,

11:07.300 --> 11:12.169
and we're going to keep
this secret for now.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.339
Just you and me.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.395
- You want me to lie?

11:16.440 --> 11:19.773
- It's not a lie if you
keep your mouth shut.

11:19.810 --> 11:23.143
Your dad has enough to worry
about without worrying

11:23.180 --> 11:26.843
if I'm going
to poison the dogs again.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.813
- I'm not fortune's fool --

11:35.860 --> 11:38.727
I'm yours.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.319
"Behold the Great Red Dragon."

11:45.370 --> 11:47.930
- And did you?

11:47.970 --> 11:50.404
- The Brooklyn Museum
is closed to the public

11:50.440 --> 11:54.399
on Tuesdays, but researchers
are admitted. You knew

11:54.440 --> 11:56.476
that's when
we'd both be going.

11:58.450 --> 12:02.113
- A sophisticated intelligence
can forecast many things.

12:02.150 --> 12:05.313
I suppose mine
is sophisticated enough.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.826
- He's contacted you.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.456
- How do you imagine
he's contacted me?

12:14.500 --> 12:17.469
Personal ads?

12:17.500 --> 12:21.391
Writing notes of admiration
on toilet paper?

12:21.440 --> 12:24.000
- There's a family out there

12:24.040 --> 12:27.203
who don't know
he's coming.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.171
We can save them.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.468
Tell me who he is.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.286
- I don't know who he is.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.125
When you close your eyes, Will,

12:45.160 --> 12:48.027
is it your family you see?

12:50.500 --> 12:52.491
- How is he choosing them?

12:52.530 --> 12:55.897
- Social media, I imagine.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.933
Can't be too careful
wrth privacy settings.

12:59.980 --> 13:04.349
- Do you know who they are?
- Yes.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.339
- And you're willing
to let them die.

13:15.490 --> 13:18.379
And I'm not letting them die.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.557
You are.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.079
(insects chirping)

13:52.900 --> 13:55.095
(creaking sound)

14:00.440 --> 14:03.500
(creaking continues)

14:28.430 --> 14:32.264
(door creaking)

14:38.710 --> 14:43.477
(silent)

14:43.510 --> 14:46.206
(floorboards creaking)

14:57.360 --> 14:59.351
- Wait for me by the car.

14:59.390 --> 15:01.699
Count to 100.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.960
If you see anyone else but me,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.935
run for the road.
- Mm.

15:06.970 --> 15:09.291
(creaking)

15:27.520 --> 15:30.284
(tense music playing)

16:11.130 --> 16:13.166
(jangling sound)

16:25.410 --> 16:28.573
- (quietly): 34...

16:52.570 --> 16:55.038
(silent)

17:06.420 --> 17:10.049
(crack)

17:21.100 --> 17:24.763
(honking and alarming sounding)

17:24.810 --> 17:27.574
(silenced gunshots)

17:46.390 --> 17:48.699
- MOM!
(tires screeching)

17:54.570 --> 17:57.232
- I ALMOST KILLED YOU!
What are you--

17:57.270 --> 17:59.636
- Get back in the car.
(silenced gunshot)

18:07.350 --> 18:10.387
(sharp thud)

18:21.460 --> 18:24.293
(screaming furiously)

19:06.210 --> 19:09.737
_ _- Your mom
IS In surgery, now.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.378
- Is there anything else I need
to know to see about Mom?

19:22.420 --> 19:25.787
- You're both safe here.

19:32.770 --> 19:35.739
- This crazy guy
wants to kill you?

19:35.770 --> 19:38.659
- No -- well,

19:38.710 --> 19:42.635
we don't know what he wants.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.706
- You gonna kill him?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.282
- No.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.982
I'm going to catch him.

19:53.020 --> 19:56.649
They'll put him
in a mental hospital

19:56.690 --> 19:59.420
so they can treat him

19:59.460 --> 20:02.429
and keep him from hurting
anybody else.

20:05.430 --> 20:09.230
- Tommy's mom
had this little newspaper.

20:09.270 --> 20:12.660
Said you killed a guy

20:12.710 --> 20:16.305
and you were put
in a mental hospital.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.639
Is it...true?

20:21.980 --> 20:24.744
- Yes. Yes.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.322
It bothers you,

20:32.360 --> 20:35.249
finding that out.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.463
Because I married your mom.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.806
- Then you shouldn't put this
guy in a mental hospital,

20:44.840 --> 20:46.865
you should kill him.

20:46.910 --> 20:50.448
I want to watch baseball.

21:01.020 --> 21:04.353
(TV playing indistinctly)

21:22.040 --> 21:25.498
- His team playing?

21:27.720 --> 21:30.780
- He read about me
in a Freddie Lounds article.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.754
I had to justify myself
to an 11-year-old.

21:36.790 --> 21:40.419
- Resentment's raising a blister
in you, Will.
-Hmm.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.769
- You think you might
lose me after this, Jack?

21:48.800 --> 21:51.837
You think I might
go back to my family?

21:51.870 --> 21:54.031
- For a minute, I did.
- Right.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.435
And then you realized
whatI realized, which is

21:56.480 --> 21:59.608
I can't go home

21:59.650 --> 22:01.971
and neither can
Molly and Walter,

22:02.020 --> 22:06.946
not until the Red Dragon
is out of the way.

22:21.100 --> 22:24.763
(heart monitor beeping)

22:38.620 --> 22:41.487
(ventilator hissing)

23:25.630 --> 23:28.861
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
You have a telephone call.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.061
It's your lawyer.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.135
Would you like to take it?

23:33.170 --> 23:35.809
- Did he say why he was calling?

23:38.510 --> 23:40.671
- I called him.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.110
To confirm that he
hasn't called you.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.517
Not since you've been
declared insane.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.211
- I could have told you that.

23:50.260 --> 23:53.559
- If only I'd known to ask.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.728
- If only.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.990
- Would you have told me
the truth?

23:59.030 --> 24:02.898
- In my own way, I always have.

24:09.210 --> 24:12.668
- Mr. Metcalf, that'll be all
for now. Thank you for
your time.

24:19.850 --> 24:23.650
- You've been talking
to the Tooth Fairy.

24:25.690 --> 24:27.658
- I think he's earned the right
to be known

24:27.700 --> 24:30.157
by the name he's chosen.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.021
He is the Great Red Dragon.

24:33.070 --> 24:36.665
- You have hubbed hell,
Dr. Lecter.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.533
- I often do.
(sighing)

24:39.570 --> 24:41.834
- You got what you wanted.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.201
Suddenly, you're
very relevant.

24:44.250 --> 24:48.277
There is one way
for you to stay relevant...

24:48.320 --> 24:52.040
...and comfortable.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.657
- You want me
to speak with the Dragon.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.726
Given his recent failure,

24:58.760 --> 25:00.751
you believe
he will seek counsel.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.224
- We need to make your contact
work for us.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.990
Standing trace order for
any time you're on the phone.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.565
When he calls,

25:10.610 --> 25:12.805
you keep him on the line.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.641
- I can't refuse him
a sympathetic ear.

25:19.680 --> 25:23.582
He no doubt needs it.

25:23.620 --> 25:27.181
(grunting)

25:27.220 --> 25:31.054
(echoing growl)

25:36.760 --> 25:39.968
(growling and grunting continue)

25:42.840 --> 25:44.831
(groaning sharply)

25:44.870 --> 25:47.134
(creature screeching)

25:49.240 --> 25:53.108
(roaring)

25:56.650 --> 25:58.618
(low snarl)

25:58.650 --> 26:01.687
(snarD
(grunﬂng)

26:27.350 --> 26:29.147
- (weakly): Don't do that...

26:29.180 --> 26:31.387
UNH!

26:31.420 --> 26:34.583
UNH! Don't do that...

26:43.360 --> 26:45.624
(heartbeat)

26:59.780 --> 27:03.272
(low growl)

27:28.080 --> 27:30.071
-D?

27:32.750 --> 27:36.413
D? You in here?

27:50.900 --> 27:53.937
- (quietly): Yes.
- What are you doing

27:53.970 --> 27:56.234
sitting here in the dark?

27:56.270 --> 27:59.330
- How do you know it's dark?

27:59.370 --> 28:01.838
- The lights aren't on.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.747
- Do you remember it?

28:06.910 --> 28:09.219
The light...

28:11.190 --> 28:14.011
Is it worse to have seen it

28:14.060 --> 28:17.154
and lost it?

28:17.190 --> 28:19.886
- I know I can never
have the light,

28:19.930 --> 28:22.319
but there are things I can have.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.760
There are things to enjoy.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.223
You sound strange.

28:32.070 --> 28:34.231
- (crying): Reba...

28:34.280 --> 28:38.148
I don't know what to say to you.

28:38.180 --> 28:41.047
I don't know
what's happening to me

28:41.080 --> 28:43.139
with you.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.785
You... You threaten me

28:45.820 --> 28:48.459
and yet you do not threaten me.

28:48.490 --> 28:51.050
(sniffing)
It's confusing.

28:57.330 --> 28:59.366
- It's OK to be confused.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.960
Spend most of our lives
confused.

29:03.940 --> 29:06.864
It's rare to really figure
anything out.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.790
- I can't be with you.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.969
- Most men are terrified
of entailing a burden.

29:41.010 --> 29:44.969
That fear is amplified
in my case.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.816
- That's not why

29:51.850 --> 29:54.410
I'm afraid.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.227
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

30:07.130 --> 30:09.360
- It was nice to spend time
with someone

30:09.400 --> 30:11.937
who has the courage
to get his hat

30:11.970 --> 30:14.279
or stay as he damn pleased

30:14.310 --> 30:16.938
and gives me credit
for the same.

30:19.180 --> 30:22.149
Get your hat, Francis.

30:22.180 --> 30:26.241
Get it and go.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.288
(sniffing)

30:58.420 --> 31:01.412
(low growl)

31:34.190 --> 31:36.488
(cord zipping)

31:42.000 --> 31:45.094
- Hello?

31:45.130 --> 31:48.099
(sobbing over the line)

31:50.070 --> 31:53.699
[You are the Dragon.
You don't have to be afraid.]

31:53.740 --> 31:56.937
[You know who speaks.]

31:58.550 --> 32:00.370
[From the beginning,
you and the Dragon]

32:00.410 --> 32:02.970
[had been one.]

32:03.020 --> 32:06.148
[You are Becoming]

32:06.190 --> 32:09.557
[and the Dragon
is your higher self.]

32:13.290 --> 32:17.454
- If I'm not as strong
as the Dragon,

32:17.500 --> 32:20.526
she will die.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.733
- Don't let fear
leach your strength.

32:23.770 --> 32:27.228
- (under his breath): I need
to think...

32:30.710 --> 32:33.406
I need to think.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.042
I...told her

32:39.090 --> 32:42.059
I can't be with her.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.129
- You are almost blind
to your own true feelings,

32:47.160 --> 32:51.665
no more able to express them
than a scar can blush.

32:54.740 --> 32:58.460
Do you know
how you feel about her?

32:58.510 --> 33:02.378
- Yes.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.605
I...

33:04.650 --> 33:08.541
I'm afraid she will
come to the house

33:08.580 --> 33:11.344
to talk.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.517
I don't know

33:13.550 --> 33:16.280
[what will happen in the house.]

33:19.330 --> 33:22.549
The Dragon may come down.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.491
(moaning)

33:26.530 --> 33:28.464
I know

33:28.500 --> 33:31.060
how easily she would tear.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.388
I think about what the...

33:47.420 --> 33:50.548
[...Dragon will do to me
ifI don't]

33:50.590 --> 33:52.581
[serve her up.]

33:58.270 --> 34:00.795
- She called me a man.

34:03.540 --> 34:07.431
A sweet...man.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.799
I didn't hear...

34:13.850 --> 34:18.048
Reba's heart.

34:20.490 --> 34:24.688
(smacking sound)
[I...didn't!]

34:24.730 --> 34:27.119
- They're listening.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.614
- The Tooth Fairy used

34:51.650 --> 34:54.187
call-spoofing software,
piggybacking on Lecter's

34:54.220 --> 34:57.485
old line, but the caller ID
showed his lawyer's number.

35:01.900 --> 35:06.189
- Hannibal's having his fun.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.811
- You're not the only one who
keeps their promises, Hannibal.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.154
The toilet, too.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.843
(crowd roaring)
(heart monitor beeping)

36:31.290 --> 36:33.918
- Wally's safe.

36:33.950 --> 36:37.613
The dogs are safe.

36:40.960 --> 36:44.259
We're picking them up
and bringing them in.

36:46.530 --> 36:49.397
- You look different.

36:49.440 --> 36:53.934
You said you wouldn't be
the same when you came home.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.336
- You said you would.

36:56.380 --> 37:00.578
- Mm! Boy, was I wrong
about that.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.011
I wanted you to go.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.324
I told you to go.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.693
Nobody to blame but myself.

37:15.730 --> 37:18.699
And Jack Crawford.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.336
I do blame Jack Crawford.

37:22.370 --> 37:26.363
- Jack knew what
he was doing.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.344
(sighing)
And so did I.

37:37.020 --> 37:40.979
- Is he after you now?

37:41.020 --> 37:43.614
Is that why
he came after us?

37:43.660 --> 37:47.050
- He came after you because
Hannibal suggested it.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.320
He urged him to do it.

37:52.700 --> 37:55.999
- It's a clammy, sick feeling.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.498
- Yeah, I know it is.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.947
- Wally almost died.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.308
My son almost died.
I almost died.

38:12.350 --> 38:16.081
I knew it was him.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.021
I knew it was him.
I saw your picture In that paper

38:19.060 --> 38:21.927
and I knew it was him.

38:26.070 --> 38:29.494
(exhaling slowly)

38:29.540 --> 38:32.361
Mm...

38:32.410 --> 38:36.039
Hell, I got mad there
for a second.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.607
(both chuckling)

38:49.990 --> 38:52.424
- I hate this, Molly.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.326
I'm sorry.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.966
- Um...

39:05.010 --> 39:08.707
This could take a while.
- It might.

39:13.710 --> 39:16.770
- We'll be back home,

39:16.820 --> 39:20.415
won't
we?

39:22.460 --> 39:24.621
- Yup.

39:29.130 --> 39:32.065
- It's tough to hold onto
anything good.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.933
It's all so slippery.

39:40.910 --> 39:43.504
- Slick as hell.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.971
(distorted beeping)

40:10.700 --> 40:12.736
- I'm just about worn out

40:12.770 --> 40:15.000
with you crazy sons of bitches.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.531
- The essence of the worst
in the human spirit

40:17.580 --> 40:20.743
is not found in the crazy
sons of bitches.

40:20.780 --> 40:22.748
Ugliness is found

40:22.780 --> 40:24.919
in the faces of the crowd.

40:26.890 --> 40:28.915
- What did you say to him?

40:30.660 --> 40:33.128
- Save yourself.
Kill them all.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.594
Then I gave him
your home address.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.793
- How's the wife?

40:42.840 --> 40:45.001
- How's my wife?

40:47.010 --> 40:49.877
She's luclq.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.041
- She survived
the Great Red Dragon.

40:54.080 --> 40:57.174
Takes a pinch
more than luck.

40:57.220 --> 41:00.644
When you look at her now,
what do you see?

41:05.790 --> 41:08.122
- You know what I see.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.194
- Before he became
the Red Dragon,

41:13.230 --> 41:15.562
this shy boy would never
have dared any of this.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.706
- Well, now he thinks
he can do anything.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.607
Anything.

41:21.640 --> 41:25.576
Anything!

41:25.610 --> 41:28.818
- The Dragon likely thinks
you are as much a monster

41:28.850 --> 41:30.875
as you think he is.

41:32.850 --> 41:36.217
- Is this a competition?

41:36.260 --> 41:40.959
- "Two souls, alas,
are dwelling in my breast,

41:40.990 --> 41:44.153
and one is striving
to forsake its brother."

41:48.000 --> 41:50.560
The Great Red Dragon
is freedom to him,

41:50.600 --> 41:52.739
shedding his skin,

41:52.770 --> 41:55.034
the sound of his voice,

41:55.080 --> 41:57.571
his own reflection.

42:00.750 --> 42:03.548
The building of a new body and
the othering of himself,

42:03.580 --> 42:05.582
the splitting of his
personality,

42:05.620 --> 42:08.589
all seem active and deliberate.

42:08.620 --> 42:11.987
He craves change.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.293
- He didn't murder
those families?

42:19.270 --> 42:23.639
He "changed" them?

42:23.670 --> 42:27.731
- Don't you crave change, Will?
