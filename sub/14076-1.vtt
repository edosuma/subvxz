[Episode 1]

00:08.390 --> 00:12.260
Everybody has
the highlight of their lives.

00:12.260 --> 00:18.900
The most glamorous
and happiest moment.

00:18.900 --> 00:22.830
For me,
today is the very day.

00:22.830 --> 00:26.600
Now I grasp
all that I have dreamed of.

00:26.600 --> 00:32.299
How I have waited
for this day.

00:32.299 --> 00:36.390
But happiness didn't last long...

00:36.390 --> 00:43.390
...because of the two women
with me now.

00:43.390 --> 00:45.390
Hold on.

00:46.390 --> 00:50.390
I think I'm standing out too much.
Tone down a color.

00:50.390 --> 00:53.630
The heroine of the day
is Lena, not me.

00:53.630 --> 00:58.390
Mine too.
She's the queen of tonight.

00:58.390 --> 01:04.260
Queen? For women,
youth is half the battle.

01:04.260 --> 01:10.100
Women in their 20's are like
a rugby ball men dash to get.

01:10.100 --> 01:17.390
Women in their 40's are like a golf ball
men want to hit far away.

01:17.390 --> 01:18.390
What about the 50's?

01:18.390 --> 01:25.560
A dodge ball men are afraid
to even brush past.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.860
So you're saying
I'm a dodge ball.

01:30.860 --> 01:34.460
Oh no.
There's always an exception.

01:34.460 --> 01:39.390
You're forever a rugby ball
to Mr. Park.

01:39.390 --> 01:43.260
"Heera! Heera, where are you?
Heera, my darling."

01:43.260 --> 01:45.330
Stop.

01:45.330 --> 01:48.390
Oh!
Your dress.

01:48.390 --> 01:52.390
I totally forgot about it.

01:53.900 --> 01:58.390
Julian! Julian!

[Family Killed In Fire
In Eumseong, Choongbook]

02:32.530 --> 02:36.660
Julian! Julian!

02:36.660 --> 02:39.500
Did you get my dress?

02:39.500 --> 02:47.390
Where the heck are you? I can't attend
the Awards in my skin! You still didn't...

02:55.100 --> 02:59.160
Just arrived from Paris.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.390
You know Nicolas Guesky,
the hotsy designer. It's his work.

03:03.390 --> 03:07.390
Look at the lines and details.

03:07.390 --> 03:11.390
Okay.
How much is it?

03:11.390 --> 03:13.160
One.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.260
Hundred thousand?

03:14.260 --> 03:16.390
[Yes.]

03:17.460 --> 03:21.390
Alright.
I am Lena Jeong,

03:21.390 --> 03:24.760
...the best emcee in Korea.
I deserve this much.

03:24.760 --> 03:30.900
Oh my god!
Gorgeous! Good!

03:30.900 --> 03:33.030
Watch me.

03:33.060 --> 03:39.390
Today is going to be
the best day of my life.

03:39.390 --> 03:43.390
What the...
That scared me.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.830
Get the phone. Must be one of
the reporters asking for an interview.

03:47.830 --> 03:52.660
Blame the popularity.

04:02.390 --> 04:05.390
Why?

04:05.390 --> 04:07.160
What's wrong?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.060
Leave me alone.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.390
- Lena?
- Beat it!

04:11.390 --> 04:17.899
Okay.
I'm going out.

04:38.760 --> 04:39.630
Yes?

04:39.630 --> 04:43.390
Where are you?
Where the heck are you?

04:43.390 --> 04:46.230
Relax.

04:46.230 --> 04:51.860
You're coming here
in person?

04:51.860 --> 04:55.960
No.
How I have come this far.

04:55.960 --> 05:01.960
I can't back off at this point.
I won't!

05:22.060 --> 05:24.390
It's me.

05:24.390 --> 05:31.430
Something urgent came up. Don't wait
for me. See you at the ceremony.

05:31.430 --> 05:37.390
At last, I can catch up
with the fox.

07:30.390 --> 07:32.930
Where are you?

07:33.700 --> 07:39.300
Doshin.
Where are you? Come out.

07:39.300 --> 07:42.130
Doshin!
Just come out!

07:42.130 --> 07:46.360
Soojeong Yi!

07:51.390 --> 07:54.390
Soojeong.

08:06.390 --> 08:07.860
What did you just say?

08:07.860 --> 08:14.390
Why, did you forget your name
since it's been so long?

08:14.390 --> 08:18.060
Indeed,
it's been a long time.

08:18.060 --> 08:23.390
It was your name
35 years ago.

08:23.390 --> 08:27.660
Why,
you still can't remember?

08:27.660 --> 08:31.760
I thought as much,
so I prepared this.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.159
Real name: Soojeong Yi.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.830
Originated from Mangdong 24,
Eumseong, Choongbook.

08:37.830 --> 08:40.360
Father: Namchol Yi.
Mother: Oglae Kim.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.390
On the night of Dec. 8, 1980,
your mother...

08:43.390 --> 08:45.100
Stop!

08:45.100 --> 08:49.960
Why are you doing this to me?
What did I do wrong?

08:49.960 --> 08:54.330
What have I done wrong to you
that you're doing this to me?

08:54.330 --> 08:58.390
You're a celeb.
The walls have ears.

08:58.390 --> 09:01.400
Tell me.
What do you want?

09:01.400 --> 09:08.000
Brat. You're as smart now
as you were in the past.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.230
Everything about Soojeong Yi
is stored in here.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.460
I can either release it to the media
or give it to you.

09:18.960 --> 09:24.700
Nothing comes free in life.
I went through a lot of trouble to find it.

09:25.600 --> 09:30.390
Well, Soojeong...

09:30.390 --> 09:34.390
Now I'm old and
I don't want to suffer.

09:34.390 --> 09:38.390
Let me benefit from you.

09:39.390 --> 09:42.560
How much do you want?

09:45.630 --> 09:48.300
$100k?

09:48.300 --> 09:50.390
Come on,
you're not that cheap.

09:50.390 --> 09:55.390
For old times' sake,
let me live off the fat of the land.

09:55.390 --> 09:59.700
We were childhood friends.

09:59.700 --> 10:04.390
Trash.
I know the likes of you.

10:04.390 --> 10:07.390
You were of no help to me.

10:07.390 --> 10:12.060
Do you know
how I've come this far!

10:12.060 --> 10:16.390
But you, you viper,
are now trying to bleed me dry?

10:16.390 --> 10:21.390
You bastard!
Bastard! Bastard!

10:25.460 --> 10:27.730
Get a grip.

10:27.730 --> 10:29.760
Can't you see what's going on?

10:29.760 --> 10:34.390
Right, you've come this far
with a lot of effort.

10:34.390 --> 10:38.430
Fine, forget it
if you don't want a deal.

10:38.430 --> 10:43.860
There are plenty of people
who'd pay for this.

10:43.900 --> 10:52.000
No. No, please don't.
Give it to me. I beg you.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.600
Doshin, I'm sorry.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.390
Please don't.

11:01.390 --> 11:06.390
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please!

11:08.800 --> 11:16.390
By looking down on me,
you lost your last chance.

11:22.130 --> 11:26.460
Hey! Come here!
Come here!

11:26.460 --> 11:30.430
- Doshin!
- Wench, come here.

11:31.530 --> 11:34.200
- Stop.
- You've become really bold.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.100
- You want to die?
- Please!

11:36.100 --> 11:39.390
Yeah?

11:56.390 --> 12:00.960
Soojeong...
Soojeong, help me! Please!

12:01.960 --> 12:07.390
Soojeong!
If I catch you, you're dead meat!

12:17.600 --> 12:22.060
Doshin...
Doshin!

14:04.260 --> 14:06.390
Hello?

14:07.390 --> 14:12.390
Hello?
Please wake up. Hello?

14:16.730 --> 14:19.030
Help...

14:19.030 --> 14:22.260
Please...call...911...

14:22.260 --> 14:24.500
911...

14:33.390 --> 14:35.100
This is 911,
what's your emergency?

14:35.100 --> 14:39.100
Yes!
Well...

14:40.300 --> 14:47.530
Hello? Hello? Please state
your emergency. Hello?

14:47.530 --> 14:50.390
Please!

14:58.390 --> 15:07.100
Welcome to the 21st
Korean Broadcast Culture Awards!

15:09.060 --> 15:14.390
I already feel the heat in this place.
Let's enjoy the opening performance first.

15:14.390 --> 15:18.160
Please welcome Rainbow!

15:44.390 --> 15:46.200
Why isn't your mom coming?

15:46.200 --> 15:50.300
She'll come.
Call her.

15:55.460 --> 15:58.300
She's not answering the phone.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.360
Don't worry.
She's thorough so she'll come.

16:02.360 --> 16:08.390
Ha. She's leaving me alone
to catch up with some fox.

16:08.390 --> 16:14.390
Women and golf clubs need a lesson
once every three days.

16:14.390 --> 16:18.000
Where on earth is she?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.390
Oh my god.
What should we do?

16:21.390 --> 16:24.560
Why doesn't she
answer the phone?

16:24.560 --> 16:28.390
Oh, headache.

16:28.390 --> 16:31.390
She can't be in trouble, right?

16:31.390 --> 16:34.200
What trouble?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.800
Oh, right.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.430
Have you any idea?

16:37.430 --> 16:41.800
Her dress was a bit too tight
when I did the fitting.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.390
Perhaps she took a diet pill
and fainted somewhere.

16:45.390 --> 16:45.900
Julian.

16:45.900 --> 16:53.730
No, she can't receive the award then.
Someone must accept it on her behalf.

16:53.730 --> 16:58.160
What if it's me?
Oh no, I'm not prepared to do that.

16:58.160 --> 17:04.060
There's no time to waste.
Coordinator!

17:04.060 --> 17:08.390
She isn't in trouble,
is she?

17:30.390 --> 17:34.930
Everything about Soojeong Yi
is stored in here.

17:40.390 --> 17:46.530
I can either release it to the media
or give it to you.

17:54.390 --> 17:57.390
Just go.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.390
Don't look back and just go.

18:00.390 --> 18:03.630
Mom...

18:26.360 --> 18:26.830
Yes.

18:26.830 --> 18:30.830
Where are you?
The Awards are about to start.

18:31.660 --> 18:34.390
The Awards?

18:35.960 --> 18:38.390
Okay.

19:09.760 --> 19:14.390
Yes.
It's destroyed now.

19:14.390 --> 19:18.230
There are no witnesses
or evidence.

19:19.390 --> 19:22.390
I must collect myself.

19:22.390 --> 19:25.630
Nothing happened.

19:38.730 --> 19:41.730
[Murderer]

19:41.730 --> 19:47.390
Who sent this?
Who the heck...

19:59.390 --> 20:01.760
Where the heck...

20:03.030 --> 20:05.330
...have you been?

20:05.330 --> 20:08.500
Sorry.
I'll tell you later.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.390
And what did you mean
by catching up with a fox?

20:12.390 --> 20:20.000
You'll see.
Something interesting will happen soon.

20:42.390 --> 20:44.630
This is Victoria amazonica.

20:44.630 --> 20:49.300
Even among thorns
it blooms the most beautifully.

20:49.300 --> 20:55.060
Can I be in full bloom
like that flower someday?

20:55.060 --> 21:00.700
You will come into bloom
like that flower.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.390
You're wrong.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.230
This is it for me.

21:10.390 --> 21:13.860
I think this is the end.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.830
However hard I try,

21:19.660 --> 21:27.390
...Soojeong Yi
cannot become the Victoria.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.000
Next is the award
for the Best Emcee.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.760
The presenter is last year's winner,
Ms. Gyongshil Lee.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.960
Please welcome her
with a round of applause.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.390
Why the heck isn't she coming?

21:55.390 --> 21:57.900
Good evening,
I'm Gyongshil Lee.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.760
I'm honored to be a part of
such a great ceremony.

22:01.760 --> 22:07.800
The 21st Korean Broadcast Culture
Awards, Best Emcee Award...

22:07.800 --> 22:10.700
I got hold of her.
She'll be here soon.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.390
I'll announce the Best Emcee.

22:13.390 --> 22:17.430
Oh, I'm her fan.

22:17.430 --> 22:26.300
The award goes to Lena Jeong
of Healing Recipes. Congratulations!

22:29.390 --> 22:34.390
Lena Jeong is the host of
the cooking and healing show.

22:34.390 --> 22:37.730
She is a top emcee
loved by many people.

22:37.730 --> 22:41.390
Let's welcome Ms. Lena Jeong.

22:48.430 --> 22:51.930
Ms. Lena Jeong?

22:53.730 --> 23:00.300
It seems she is not present.
We'll award the prize to her proxy.

23:00.300 --> 23:03.100
Yes.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.060
Oh, there she comes.

23:09.300 --> 23:15.390
What a dramatic appearance.
Congratulations.

23:20.630 --> 23:25.460
Ms. Lena Jeong,
acceptance speech please.

23:30.160 --> 23:35.600
Thank you.
For the past year, I was loved...

23:35.600 --> 23:40.060
...more than I've ever been loved
all my life.

23:40.060 --> 23:46.800
I'd like to thank
each and every one of you.

23:46.800 --> 23:52.830
In addition,
if I have done any wrong,

23:52.830 --> 23:55.390
...I'd like to ask your forgiveness.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.390
She's a woman of humility.

23:58.390 --> 24:00.500
I think there's no one
who hates Lena Jeong.

24:00.500 --> 24:04.930
No. Please give her
a round of applause.

24:04.930 --> 24:12.390
My favorite flower
is Victoria amazonica.

24:12.390 --> 24:18.700
It's so big and beautiful
it is also called the queen's flower.

24:18.700 --> 24:27.000
It comes into bloom among thorns
and bears the most beautiful flower.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.030
The flower blooms by itself...

24:32.030 --> 24:38.390
...and sinks back into water
in its full bloom.

24:39.390 --> 24:43.390
Just like the Victoria,
today...

24:43.390 --> 24:53.390
...at this happiest moment of my life,
I'd like to resign my post as an emcee.

24:56.100 --> 25:03.390
And I hope that
my assistant and co-host,

25:03.390 --> 25:08.390
...Ms. Esol Kang,
will take over the position.

25:13.400 --> 25:18.900
Esol, please come up
to the stage.

25:18.900 --> 25:22.930
That was an unexpected award speech.
Ms. Kang, please come up to the stage.

25:22.930 --> 25:27.060
Let's have a round of applause
for Ms. Kang.

25:32.530 --> 25:36.260
What the. Is this what you meant
by something interesting?

25:36.260 --> 25:39.260
Is she crazy or what?

25:39.260 --> 25:42.390
Flowers never fall off
without reason.

25:42.390 --> 25:47.390
She must have her reasons.

25:47.390 --> 25:50.830
She has great potential.

25:50.830 --> 25:59.390
I hope you'll give a lot of love
to her in my place.

26:29.060 --> 26:34.960
[1 year ago]

26:37.930 --> 26:39.390
Who is it?

26:39.390 --> 26:44.390
Monthly Economy.
We've come to interview Mr. Park.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.530
He made a pretty penny as I heard.
Wasn't he an odd-job man?

27:00.530 --> 27:06.930
Watch your mouth. The newly rich
are picky because it's their complex.

27:06.930 --> 27:10.200
Oh, hi!
Welcome!

27:10.200 --> 27:14.200
Taesoo's been looking forward
to see you.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.230
Thank you for taking the trouble
to come so far.

27:17.230 --> 27:21.230
Are you Mrs. Park
and the eldest son?

27:22.390 --> 27:24.900
It's cold.
Please come with us.

27:24.900 --> 27:25.800
Please.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.390
She called me Mrs. Park.

27:29.390 --> 27:30.700
Come on in.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.960
Come in.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.730
- Please feel at home.
- Come in.

27:35.730 --> 27:41.260
Nice interior.
Was it your decision?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.390
Thank you.

27:43.390 --> 27:46.390
There he comes.

27:46.390 --> 27:49.360
Hi, Ms. Song.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.390
Congrats on winning
Businessman of the Month.

27:51.390 --> 27:56.390
Thanks. It feels good
to receive such an award.

27:56.390 --> 28:00.390
There was
no prize money though.

28:02.600 --> 28:06.390
Your wife and your son
should join the interview.

28:06.390 --> 28:09.560
Who's my wife and
who's my son?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.030
Aren't they your....

28:11.030 --> 28:15.360
She's too old to be my wife. They're
my mother-in-law and brother-in-law.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.390
I'm sorry?

28:16.390 --> 28:20.390
I'm only older than you
by three years.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.930
Mom.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.390
Hi.

28:28.390 --> 28:30.390
You got the wrong person.

28:30.390 --> 28:32.390
This is my wife.

28:32.390 --> 28:35.430
An Ewha graduate.
She was May Queen.

28:35.430 --> 28:39.530
Don't we look good together?

28:39.530 --> 28:42.390
Yes.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.390
Go ahead.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.700
I love the aroma.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.390
It's Luwak.

28:54.390 --> 28:56.600
You know,
the expensive raccoon's feces.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.390
Honey.

28:59.390 --> 29:03.390
Sorry.
Badger's feces.

29:04.390 --> 29:07.930
I don't know why it's famous.

29:07.930 --> 29:14.030
But since she loves it,
I spend money on it.

29:14.030 --> 29:15.900
How happy you must be.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.390
Why yes.

29:17.390 --> 29:24.330
He always puts his family first
before his business.

29:24.330 --> 29:31.390
He's a respected father, attentive
husband, and caring son-in-law.

29:31.390 --> 29:37.390
Being so nice even to his in-laws,
he's the best husband.

29:37.390 --> 29:40.930
The best husband?

29:43.390 --> 29:47.230
Let's talk about your family then.

29:47.260 --> 29:49.630
Isn't your eldest son
the director of TNC Foods?

29:49.630 --> 29:54.230
Yes.
He's doing a good job.

29:54.230 --> 29:56.500
You boast about him.

29:57.700 --> 30:04.390
Our eldest son, Minjoon, as you know,
is not my own son.

30:04.390 --> 30:07.700
So I can tell you
about him objectively.

30:07.700 --> 30:12.660
He's so upright, warm-hearted,
and romantic.

30:12.660 --> 30:19.730
His only flaw is that
he's too perfect.

30:21.160 --> 30:21.960
What is it?

30:21.960 --> 30:27.630
Mr. Chairman is looking for you urgently
for an interview picture.

30:27.630 --> 30:29.900
Okay.

30:31.390 --> 30:38.930
So tiring. Doesn't he know
people point the finger at him?

30:40.390 --> 30:44.560
Are you leaving already?
Stay a little more, please?

30:44.560 --> 30:47.390
I have something to tell you.

30:47.390 --> 30:51.900
How long should I wait? I haven't been
offered any roles these days.

30:51.900 --> 30:59.630
I want to quit everything and marry.
Tell your father about us.

31:01.630 --> 31:03.400
Wait.

31:03.400 --> 31:07.390
I have something to give you.

31:15.600 --> 31:22.160
Surprise! I'm four weeks pregnant.
Four weeks.

31:25.390 --> 31:31.390
Are you crazy? I said I'm pregnant.
I have your baby!

31:31.390 --> 31:33.660
Take responsibility.
Marry me!

31:33.700 --> 31:39.390
I told you from the first that if you
demand marriage, we'll be history.

31:39.390 --> 31:43.560
- But...
- I'm sterile.

31:44.390 --> 31:49.390
I hate marriage and children the most.
So I had a vasectomy.

31:49.390 --> 31:54.430
You got the wrong man.
I'm not your baby's father.

31:57.800 --> 32:03.830
Don't put Seowoo through to me.
Keep her away from my office.

32:08.390 --> 32:12.830
I'd better put this on
to keep the flies away.

32:12.830 --> 32:18.060
He must be the perfect guy
we see in the TV dramas.

32:18.060 --> 32:23.390
Yes. As the successor of TNC,
he has to be upright in every aspect.

32:23.390 --> 32:28.060
You must be proud of him.
What about your second son?

32:28.100 --> 32:31.390
Oh, Jaejoon?

32:31.390 --> 32:34.390
Let me boast about him.

32:34.390 --> 32:37.960
Though I'm ignorant,

32:37.960 --> 32:39.800
...thanks to his mother's genes,

32:39.800 --> 32:43.390
...he graduated
from a top medical college.

32:43.390 --> 32:46.390
He's in training
at a cosmetic surgery hospital.

32:46.390 --> 32:53.500
He's tall, handsome, and smart.
I'm sure he'll become the best doctor.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.460
I really can't understand women.

32:58.460 --> 33:02.630
They spend money on food
and then on liposuction.

33:02.630 --> 33:07.390
We make money thanks to that.
Just shut up and do the job.

33:07.390 --> 33:10.700
Yes, ma'am.
Your wish is my command.

33:10.700 --> 33:14.390
Let's see.

33:26.390 --> 33:29.430
Okay.

33:35.230 --> 33:39.390
Okay...
Done!

33:42.030 --> 33:44.800
Jaejoon, press out pus.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.390
Sorry?

33:45.390 --> 33:50.400
How long will you just stand by?
Do it.

33:55.390 --> 33:59.360
Press hard.

34:04.500 --> 34:10.230
Hey, open your eyes
and do it right.

34:14.730 --> 34:17.389
- Harder, harder.
- Harder.

34:17.389 --> 34:21.260
Press harder.
Yes, good. Harder.

34:26.389 --> 34:28.389
Oh my god.

34:28.389 --> 34:35.389
Again? Can he make
a good husband for Yura?

34:35.389 --> 34:39.830
Honey,
finish the job.

34:39.830 --> 34:43.260
When will he get over it?

34:44.600 --> 34:47.389
Man, he's heavy.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.929
That mama's boy.

34:56.800 --> 35:03.390
How did you graduate
from medical college? Grow up.

35:09.390 --> 35:11.390
Hi, Heera.

35:11.390 --> 35:16.160
Oh, Jaejoon?
One second, please.

35:16.160 --> 35:20.390
Your father wants you to come home
this instant to take a picture.

35:20.390 --> 35:21.530
My father?

35:21.530 --> 35:24.700
Can you drive?

35:24.700 --> 35:30.390
I'm super dizzy. Can you ask
my mom to pick me up?

35:31.360 --> 35:35.360
The master would like
to be picked up.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.830
My father?

35:36.830 --> 35:42.600
He always says, "To be a father is easy
but to be a good father is not."

35:42.600 --> 35:48.390
My father is the best father
of all fathers.

35:50.390 --> 35:52.390
Say something, Doctor Son.

35:52.390 --> 35:55.390
My dream is to become
like Schweitzer.

35:55.390 --> 36:02.000
My father inspired the same love in me
since I was little. I admire you.

36:04.300 --> 36:06.360
You just heard who I am.

36:06.360 --> 36:15.000
My two sons will lead TNC to capture
the Chinese market next year. You'll see.

36:16.390 --> 36:20.060
Can I take your family picture?
Please gather around the chairman.

36:20.060 --> 36:21.060
Sure.

36:21.060 --> 36:26.390
Here we go.
Look at the camera. One, two...

37:05.760 --> 37:08.760
Taesoo Park...

37:08.760 --> 37:15.930
Yes. Perhaps this is
the last chance for me.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.330
[Kaohsiung, Taiwan]

37:53.390 --> 37:56.390
There's no time.

38:04.400 --> 38:08.160
A lunch delivery for you!

38:10.360 --> 38:12.500
Shrimp for the director.

38:12.500 --> 38:15.300
Cuttlefish
for the manager.

38:15.300 --> 38:18.200
Chicken
for the general manager.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.390
And stir-fried vegetables for you.

38:21.390 --> 38:26.390
Thank you for your order.

38:26.390 --> 38:30.200
Enjoy your lunch!

38:32.390 --> 38:35.500
I have more deliveries.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.660
Yes, your lunch is on the way.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.800
Hey, Korean please.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.730
Mom?

38:41.760 --> 38:49.390
Time flies today.
The sun is already at high noon.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.390
Did you eat lunch?

38:53.390 --> 38:58.530
Not yet. I have more deliveries.
How about you?

38:58.530 --> 39:03.330
Don't worry about me.
Just don't skip a meal.

39:03.330 --> 39:05.960
Oh, and...

39:05.960 --> 39:07.900
Did you get your paycheck?

39:07.900 --> 39:13.830
Why? Do you need money?
We've already paid interest.

39:13.830 --> 39:16.390
No, forget it.

39:16.390 --> 39:22.390
It'd be better to take a candy from
a child. I can't ask you for more.

39:22.390 --> 39:26.530
I'll let you work.
Bye.

39:26.530 --> 39:30.390
Mom. Mom?

39:43.930 --> 39:50.390
Why the big sigh?
What's the matter?

39:51.360 --> 39:53.630
What is it?

39:53.630 --> 39:57.600
You know why Eunsol came here.

40:00.390 --> 40:04.200
Her tuition is due tomorrow,

40:04.200 --> 40:09.160
...but I have nothing left in my pocket
after paying interest.

40:09.160 --> 40:14.530
That's why she's working here
to earn her tuition, but it's not enough.

40:14.530 --> 40:16.830
What to do...

40:17.500 --> 40:22.390
How come
we are so unfortunate?

40:22.390 --> 40:28.000
It's all your fault. You shouldn't have
invited my husband to Kaohsiung.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.390
Why did you have to work
in partnership with him?

40:31.390 --> 40:40.560
I lost money and my husband because
of you and became a widow in my 50's.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.390
Are you done?

40:43.390 --> 40:46.390
Get it straight.

40:46.390 --> 40:50.390
It's me who's the victim.

40:50.390 --> 40:55.130
If he hadn't expanded the business,
my wife wouldn't have left home.

40:55.130 --> 41:00.390
I'm the single father
who has deep sorrow in my heart.

41:00.390 --> 41:06.390
My. It was your idea to open
a Chinese restaurant in Taiwan.

41:06.390 --> 41:11.560
"Sell air conditioner in Alaska
and fur coats in Africa."

41:11.560 --> 41:16.390
It's called reverse thinking!
You're so ignorant.

41:16.390 --> 41:21.390
What? Ignorant?
Yes, I am ignorant.

41:21.390 --> 41:23.330
But it's none of your business!

41:23.330 --> 41:26.660
You're really...!

41:26.660 --> 41:29.830
Hey.
Did you just hit me?

41:29.830 --> 41:34.390
You hit me! How dare you use violence
against a frail woman.

41:34.390 --> 41:38.130
Fine, let's do this!

41:41.930 --> 41:45.390
Here comes the foreman!

41:48.500 --> 41:54.330
Please act your age. How come
you never meet without fighting?

41:54.330 --> 41:58.060
Mr. Hur, you were
my dad's best friend.

41:58.060 --> 42:01.360
He's watching you in heaven,
so don't be mean to my mom.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.060
Exactly!
That's my girl!

42:04.060 --> 42:10.390
You're the same. We're all in the
same boat, so can't you get along well?

42:10.390 --> 42:13.460
Stop goofing around and work!

42:14.390 --> 42:18.390
Cease fire.
Or we'll get the chop.

42:18.390 --> 42:21.390
Jeez.

42:21.390 --> 42:25.630
Pooh! I'd better listen
to Korean music.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.360
"Age is nothing but a number."

42:28.360 --> 42:31.830
At least you have taste in music.

42:38.400 --> 42:41.390
My.
How unfashionable.

42:41.390 --> 42:44.460
Your dance is so outdated.

42:44.460 --> 42:50.160
Look at me.
Just move the lower body.

42:50.160 --> 42:53.930
Your dance is no better than mine.

42:55.390 --> 42:59.390
Age is nothing but a number

42:59.390 --> 43:04.930
Love has no age limit

43:22.390 --> 43:23.900
What are you doing here?
Get out!

43:23.900 --> 43:30.060
Sir, teach me how to make
the rice bowl sauce.

43:30.060 --> 43:32.730
As the saying goes,
helping others benefits you.

43:32.730 --> 43:34.390
Cut the crap.

43:34.390 --> 43:37.390
Go clean the hall!

43:45.300 --> 43:48.330
Finished!

43:51.390 --> 43:55.000
Here.
The rice bowl sauce recipe.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.390
Dongu!

43:59.390 --> 44:04.390
Well? I'm the only one
that cares for you, eh?

44:05.160 --> 44:07.390
How did you find out?

44:07.390 --> 44:11.390
By the way,
why are you so nice to me?

44:13.390 --> 44:17.500
You know I'm nosy.

44:20.930 --> 44:28.630
Fool. You don't know I got a lump
on my head trying to find that out.

44:31.100 --> 44:35.360
Dinner time!

44:36.390 --> 44:43.930
Bean paste stew!
Koreans need a hearty meal like this.

44:47.390 --> 44:51.390
Uh oh.
What is this taste?

44:51.390 --> 44:53.390
It tastes weird.

44:53.390 --> 44:55.460
Really?

44:59.100 --> 45:02.390
I bet you made this.

45:03.600 --> 45:09.390
Then don't eat. You're a freeloader
but complain too much.

45:09.390 --> 45:11.730
Look at the way you talk.

45:11.730 --> 45:17.900
It's you who said we'd better eat together
and save money to pay our debt.

45:17.900 --> 45:23.200
Fine. I'll take back my words. Go back
to your home with your sons, okay?

45:23.200 --> 45:25.390
So cheap and nasty.

45:25.390 --> 45:31.390
I will never talk with you again.

45:31.390 --> 45:36.390
- Please stop.
- Father, please sit down.

45:38.390 --> 45:42.800
Esol,
can you season the stew?

45:50.390 --> 45:52.430
Taste it.

45:56.390 --> 45:58.960
Oh, Esol!

46:00.130 --> 46:03.130
You're the Jewel.
So delicious!

46:03.130 --> 46:05.390
You're the best!

46:06.000 --> 46:10.200
Can't believe you have
such a talented daughter.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.600
Maybe she's not
your own daughter.

46:13.600 --> 46:17.390
Cut it out.
Just eat this.

46:17.390 --> 46:22.130
I wish Esol would marry
into our family. Right, Dongoo?

46:22.130 --> 46:23.600
Huh?

46:24.730 --> 46:26.390
Yeah.

46:26.390 --> 46:31.660
He agrees.
Marry me, Esol.

46:33.030 --> 46:36.100
Youngoo,
do you like her that much?

46:36.100 --> 46:41.390
Yes.
I like her the best.

46:41.390 --> 46:47.390
She's pretty, kind, and most of all,
she's a good cook.

46:47.390 --> 46:51.390
Then you should be nice to me.

46:51.390 --> 46:55.600
Call me "Mother-in-law."

46:57.390 --> 47:00.390
Mother-in-law.

47:01.390 --> 47:03.930
Yes.

47:07.030 --> 47:09.000
Mom, take this.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.530
What is it?

47:14.360 --> 47:15.390
Esol.

47:15.390 --> 47:18.700
I got an advance.
It's for Eunsol's tuition.

47:18.700 --> 47:20.830
You don't have money.

47:20.830 --> 47:23.660
Don't worry about anything.
Just study hard.

47:23.660 --> 47:27.430
I told you.
I'm the family head.

47:27.430 --> 47:31.060
I'm hungry.
Let's eat.

47:36.300 --> 47:43.390
Far from helping my kids,
I give them only trouble in a foreign land.

47:44.860 --> 47:48.390
I can't be a human being.

47:48.390 --> 47:51.390
What's wrong with you?

47:51.390 --> 47:57.330
Yangsoon,
our lives won't always be like this.

47:57.330 --> 48:00.530
We'll see better days.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.860
The stew tastes great!

48:32.830 --> 48:38.390
Guess you feel sad and distressed.

48:38.390 --> 48:44.300
You can't sign up for a cooking class
because of Eunsol's tuition.

48:44.300 --> 48:49.300
You always sacrifice yourself.
What about your dream?

48:50.200 --> 48:52.330
Dongoo.

48:52.330 --> 48:57.390
Do you know
what my favorite saying is?

48:57.390 --> 49:02.660
"Your family is a burden
if you shun them,

49:02.660 --> 49:07.300
...but they are love
if you embrace them."

49:07.300 --> 49:13.930
I love my family so much.

49:13.930 --> 49:17.630
So I'm glad that
I can do something for them.

49:17.630 --> 49:22.390
But what about you?
You want to become a chef.

49:22.390 --> 49:24.390
That's why you do
two to three jobs.

49:24.390 --> 49:31.400
I will achieve my dream.
I can learn for myself.

49:34.390 --> 49:40.390
And look at this.
I have a supportive friend.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.960
Here.

49:50.960 --> 49:55.390
What is this?
Another recipe?

49:55.390 --> 49:56.390
Yura Seo?

49:56.390 --> 50:00.660
She's a Korean student
in need of a maid.

50:00.660 --> 50:05.390
The pay is high.
You can enroll in a cooking class.

50:05.390 --> 50:08.390
Oh, amigo.

50:11.900 --> 50:15.390
You're the best.

50:15.390 --> 50:23.600
Fool. You don't know
I think of you as more than a friend.

50:38.330 --> 50:40.330
When did you get up?

50:40.330 --> 50:45.390
Do you know what I'm thinking
when I see you sleep?

50:45.390 --> 50:49.390
I don't know. Why would you watch me
sleep, I must look unsightly.

50:49.390 --> 50:55.930
Unsightly? You're beautiful
whatever you do.

50:55.930 --> 51:01.390
When I first got a job
at your father's factory,

51:01.390 --> 51:07.390
...you were a college student,
acting haughty and proud.

51:07.390 --> 51:12.400
You didn't even look at me.

51:12.400 --> 51:20.660
My life is a success to have such a lofty
woman sleeping next to me, isn't it?

51:22.160 --> 51:30.390
I know. Surely, you never know
what life is going to bring you.

51:30.390 --> 51:37.390
Thank you for marrying
this old and ignorant man.

51:37.390 --> 51:43.390
I'll give extra attention to Jaejoon.

51:43.390 --> 51:45.560
No.

51:45.560 --> 51:52.030
Don't discriminate between
Minjoon and Jaejoon. It bothers me.

51:52.030 --> 51:58.030
The successor to TNC
should be Minjoon. Don't forget.

51:58.030 --> 52:02.390
This is why my darling's the best.

52:02.390 --> 52:09.330
You are exactly as you appear.
Just adorable.

52:09.330 --> 52:14.800
Get dressed. Dr. Choi and Dr. Seo
will come with your test result.

52:14.800 --> 52:23.000
Okay. I must take good care
of my health to live long with you.

52:26.390 --> 52:31.960
The test result is better than last year.
You'll live to be 100 at this rate.

52:31.960 --> 52:41.330
Don't make me laugh.
Money can't buy your health overnight.

52:41.330 --> 52:45.200
Both you and I are over the hill.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.390
Mom, if you're done eating,
please go upstairs.

52:48.390 --> 52:51.900
Hey, I'm talking.

52:51.900 --> 52:55.160
- Doctor Seo.
- Yes.

52:55.160 --> 53:01.390
Look at my face. I got Botox shots the
other day. Doesn't it look strange now?

53:01.390 --> 53:04.300
I'll go the day after tomorrow,
so please fix it for free.

53:04.300 --> 53:07.160
- Changsoo.
- Yes.

53:07.160 --> 53:10.560
Okay. I'm only a few years
older than Taesoo,

53:10.560 --> 53:14.700
...but you treat me
like an old useless woman.

53:14.700 --> 53:17.390
Changsoo, let's go.

53:18.390 --> 53:21.390
Wait.

53:25.360 --> 53:31.160
Dr. Seo, everyday's like this.
Isn't it ridiculous?

53:31.160 --> 53:34.160
I like it.
I can get a feel for humanity.

53:34.160 --> 53:36.960
How's your breaking into
the Chinese market?

53:36.960 --> 53:42.700
Going well.
Starting from Shanghai,

53:42.700 --> 53:46.760
...Minjoon will open 50 restaurants
in China next year.

53:46.760 --> 53:48.130
Is it going well?

53:48.130 --> 53:51.390
Actually, I was going to report something
to you about that. I'll tell you later.

53:51.390 --> 53:53.390
Okay.

53:53.390 --> 53:56.830
Jaejoon, when are you going
to leave for Kaohsiung?

53:56.830 --> 53:59.430
Kaohsiung?
Mom...

53:59.430 --> 54:04.900
Seems you forgot about
your arranged date with Yura.

54:04.900 --> 54:11.700
Your father and we are going to open
a cosmetic surgery hospital in Qingdao.

54:11.700 --> 54:14.900
That's why Yura is studying
in Kaohsiung.

54:14.900 --> 54:18.530
I told you I won't marry a girl
whose face I've never seen.

54:18.530 --> 54:19.700
And an arranged marriage...

54:19.700 --> 54:23.390
Why do you need to see her face?

54:23.390 --> 54:26.900
Just listen to us.
When is he going to leave?

54:26.900 --> 54:29.760
This Saturday,
her graduation day.

54:29.760 --> 54:35.100
It'll be too late.
Go today and meet her.

54:35.100 --> 54:37.390
Father,
I really don't want to marry...

54:37.390 --> 54:39.730
Why, you!

54:39.730 --> 54:43.460
Your brother gave me enough headaches.
Not you too!

54:43.460 --> 54:50.030
Honey, I'll talk to him.
Please calm down. Stop. Please.

54:51.390 --> 54:58.390
Jaejoon, you'll leave for Kaohsiung,
right? Answer.

54:58.390 --> 55:02.730
Okay.
I'll leave right away.

55:05.330 --> 55:08.600
What a boorish family.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.900
Do we have to become
in-laws with them?

55:10.900 --> 55:17.390
Why did you marry me?
Wasn't it for my father's hospital?

55:17.390 --> 55:18.500
The way you talk.

55:18.500 --> 55:24.330
To the people in our league,
marriage is business.

55:24.330 --> 55:29.100
I want to grow my hospital in China.
It needs money...

55:29.100 --> 55:33.730
...and Taesoo Park has it.
So just be quiet.

55:33.730 --> 55:36.400
But what about Yura's life?

55:36.400 --> 55:39.900
Jaejoon is a cowardly mama's boy.

55:39.900 --> 55:43.390
No one can handle her.

55:43.390 --> 55:49.830
A mama's boy is better for her
to dominate. Just like us.

55:52.800 --> 55:56.390
Yeah, you are perfect.

55:57.390 --> 56:02.600
I'm going to call Yura.

56:19.230 --> 56:22.390
Hi, Dad.

56:23.300 --> 56:26.860
I'm tired.
Call me later.

56:26.860 --> 56:31.390
Congrats. You're having a marriage date
in three hours. Good luck.

56:31.390 --> 56:34.390
I'll send you his photo.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.390
A marriage date?

56:40.390 --> 56:44.560
Are you crazy?
I'm still too young.

56:46.160 --> 56:48.730
Okay.

56:48.730 --> 56:51.390
Hang up.

56:55.390 --> 57:02.830
Marriage when I need to enjoy my youth?
Give me a break.

57:04.560 --> 57:10.360
Nuts!
Who the heck is it this early?

57:12.060 --> 57:13.700
What is it?

57:13.700 --> 57:16.390
I brought the maid you asked for.

57:16.390 --> 57:20.030
How do you do?
I am Esol Kang.

57:23.260 --> 57:24.430
You came at
just the right time.

57:24.430 --> 57:28.390
Forget about cleaning.
I have another job for you.

57:28.390 --> 57:31.390
Another job?

57:33.360 --> 57:36.390
Name: Jaejoon Park.
Age: 28.

57:36.390 --> 57:39.390
He'll land in Taiwan soon.
Go meet him at the airport.

57:39.390 --> 57:42.390
Look here.
What sort of job is it?

57:42.390 --> 57:44.930
Date him in my place.

57:44.930 --> 57:51.390
He'll stay here for three days. Show him
around Kaohsiung and send him back.

57:51.390 --> 57:54.390
Are you crazy? She doesn't do
those kind of part-time jobs.

57:54.390 --> 57:56.730
How do we know
what sort of guy it is?

57:56.730 --> 58:00.390
I'll pay you double.

58:00.390 --> 58:02.900
What do you say?

58:15.130 --> 58:18.390
Mom, it's so hot here.
Like summer.

58:18.390 --> 58:22.390
Did you have a nice flight?
Did you apply sun cream?

58:22.390 --> 58:27.560
I can't see Yura Seo.
She didn't come to fetch me.

58:27.560 --> 58:30.760
Don't you see a white foreign car?

58:30.760 --> 58:31.530
Did you call her?

58:31.530 --> 58:37.130
She doesn't answer. It's so hot.
I'm just going back to Korea.

58:39.960 --> 58:43.700
Mr. Jaejoon Park!
Mr. Jaejoon Park!

58:43.700 --> 58:45.390
Mr. Jaejoon Park?
Mr. Jaejoon Park!

58:45.390 --> 58:48.390
Mr. Jaejoon Park!
Jaejoon Park!

58:48.390 --> 58:50.660
- Mom, I'll call you later.
- Jaejoon Park, a 28 year old from Seoul!

58:50.660 --> 58:55.330
What the heck are you doing?
Lower your voice.

58:55.330 --> 58:59.400
Mr. Jaejoon Park?
You came for an arranged date, right?

59:01.160 --> 59:03.390
Hey.
Lower your voice.

59:03.390 --> 59:06.390
Huh? What did you say?
I can't hear you.

59:06.390 --> 59:10.390
Look, take off the helmet.

59:10.390 --> 59:14.390
Oh, I forgot.

59:30.390 --> 59:35.730
Sorry. You know,
I've never had an arranged date.

59:35.730 --> 59:39.160
I am Yura Seo.

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:27.260
Mister, do you have
what I asked for?

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.260
Oh, one sec.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:39.430
I can lend it to you only for today.
It's expensive.

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:42.390
Don't worry.

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.530
That is Victoria amazonica.

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:54.960
Even among thorns it blooms into
the most beautiful flower.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.390
So it's also known
as the queen's flower.

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:03.530
You will come into bloom
like that flower.

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:08.230
Yes, Lena.
You are not over yet.

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:13.360
Today, you will start
to come into bloom.

01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:26.390
Miss, when will you pay
the overdue rent?

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:29.390
You came
at just the right time.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:34.800
You were interested in this.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.600
How much
would you like to buy it for?

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600
This must be expensive.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.390
I need money to invest.
Name the price.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:55.100
Try it. It's tuna pasta,
our new menu.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:06.330
Too fishy.
Darn it.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.200
You can't enter
the Chinese market with this.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.360
You have too keen taste.
I will strengthen the...

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:19.390
No excuses. Replace the entire staff.
Having the right personnel is key.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:22.330
I have an interview
for a manager position.

01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:25.390
Pick the right person.

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:31.000
No. I'd better interview the candidates.
Save a seat for me.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.390
Father.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.760
Help!

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.390
What happened?

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:48.160
I don't know. He collapsed
all of a sudden during the meal.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.600
Mister, wake up.

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:52.390
Call 911!

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.390
Does he have
any chronic disease?

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:58.460
No, he's healthy. He just collapsed
while eating the salad.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.390
What does she mean?
Then is something wrong with our food?

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:06.390
That's impossible.
Mister, wake up.

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:09.390
Did you call 911?

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.500
Excuse me.
Let me see.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:34.390
[Subtitles provided by MBC]

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.390
I think you're really amusing.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:41.390
Tada!

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:43.000
You think you are Yura Seo?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.390
Can't I? I want to feel the thrill
and laugh like others.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:50.230
Nothing's impossible
when we join hands.

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.960
TNC is going through
a general crisis.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.390
Who does she think she is?

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:58.390
Who the heck is the brat
that captivated Jaejoon?

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:02.860
I dated you against my will
from beginning to end.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:08.760
I wanted to work in my mother's land.
Seems Korea is no place for me.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.390
I've put enough bait.
