01:43.820 --> 01:47.323
Oh, debbie,
you've got magic fingers.

01:47.824 --> 01:50.326
Oh, i bet you give
a great hand job.

01:50.827 --> 01:53.830
Yeah, she does.
Hey, there's my baby.

01:53.830 --> 01:57.333
Debbie, you gotta put her
on the "a" list, really.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.836
She rides better
than willie shoemaker.

01:59.836 --> 02:01.838
Did she go to the whip?
He is so crazy.

02:01.838 --> 02:04.841
Only in the home stretch.

02:04.841 --> 02:08.845
Ah, another
satisfied customer.

02:08.845 --> 02:11.848
I think he's having
a heart attack!

02:14.100 --> 02:16.102
Don't move.

02:16.486 --> 02:19.989
Go see if dr. Mop- n- glo
is still here.

02:20.490 --> 02:22.492
What do you mean,
dr. Mop- n- glo?

02:22.492 --> 02:24.494
Who?
Don't worry.
He's a real doctor.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.246
A dermatologist.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.114
Excuse me.
What's the matter?

02:28.615 --> 02:31.618
Dr. Edelstein, looks like
he's having a heart attack.

02:31.868 --> 02:35.371
I don't need no doctor.
It's just my back.

02:35.371 --> 02:38.374
Nice and slow.
Oh, god.

02:39.876 --> 02:43.379
Grab the rail.
Grab the rail.
That's right.

02:43.379 --> 02:45.882
Go easy.
Go easy, now.
That's it.

02:46.382 --> 02:49.385
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
Oh, mama.

02:49.385 --> 02:51.387
That's it.
That's it.

02:51.387 --> 02:55.892
Come on. That's it.
Hold the rail.

02:56.142 --> 02:58.645
I got it.
Hold the rail.

03:01.147 --> 03:05.034
Go slow.
That's it.
That's it.

03:15.545 --> 03:19.048
Fuck this.
What, your fuckin' back
still botherin' you?

03:19.048 --> 03:21.050
Yeah!

03:23.553 --> 03:27.173
F. B. I.!
Nobody move!
You believe this shit?

03:28.925 --> 03:31.928
Come on. It's
a friendly card game.
Relax, jimmy.

03:31.928 --> 03:35.431
If i wanted to bust up
card games, i'd have
a donut in my mouth.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.594
Hey! Hey!
Get him!

04:04.594 --> 04:06.963
You! You!
-

04:11.851 --> 04:15.855
oh, my goodness!
Do you know what this is?
It's a fucking gun!

04:28.117 --> 04:30.620
Fuckin' jimmy's
still in jail.

04:30.620 --> 04:34.624
- It don't mean shit.
- I don't like it.
This is how it starts.

04:34.624 --> 04:36.626
I think it was
a potluck raid.

04:36.626 --> 04:39.629
You know, make it look like
they're earnin' their pay.
I agree.

04:39.629 --> 04:41.631
Then why the fuck
would pussy run?

04:42.131 --> 04:45.134
The guy's out of breath
liftin' his dick up
to take a leak.

04:46.753 --> 04:51.007
So, puss, your ears
must be ringin'.

04:51.007 --> 04:53.009
Come on, run.

04:53.009 --> 04:56.512
Ha, ha. You guys
are a fuckin' riot.

04:56.512 --> 05:00.516
We were just gonna draw straws
to see who's goin' down there
and bail you out.

05:00.516 --> 05:03.019
My wife did.
I nearly strangled her
on the ride home.

05:03.519 --> 05:05.655
My head's hurtin',
i got angina,

05:06.155 --> 05:08.658
and on top of all that,
i threw my goddamn
back out again.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.911
Maybe it was
that ten- yard dash.

05:12.161 --> 05:13.663
We don't run.
It's embarrassing.

05:14.163 --> 05:15.665
Please. They robbed me,
those federal pricks.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.668
- What do you mean?
- They grabbed four dimes
from me.

05:18.668 --> 05:22.422
You shouldn't carry
that type of cash.

05:22.422 --> 05:25.425
Never mind.
I need a drink.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.798
Oh, jesus!

05:45.194 --> 05:47.196
This better be good.
I was takin' my kid fishing.

05:47.196 --> 05:50.199
Ah, jesus. What,
no "how you been?
How's it doin', vin"?

05:50.700 --> 05:52.702
I thought we understood
each other, right?

05:52.702 --> 05:56.706
I don't give two shits
about you, your family or
whether you take it up the ass.

05:56.706 --> 05:59.709
Now, what's so important
you take me away from my boat?

06:00.209 --> 06:01.711
Hey, fuck face,
where you goin'?

06:02.211 --> 06:05.214
Why do you gotta talk to me
like this? I do a lot
of risky shit for you.

06:05.214 --> 06:08.084
You're not doin'
charity work, remember?

06:10.586 --> 06:12.588
All right. I'm sorry.

06:12.588 --> 06:16.843
Hey, vin, how ya doin'?
What do you got for me?

06:19.846 --> 06:22.982
- Bompensiero.
- Pussy?

06:23.483 --> 06:26.986
- What about him?
- He's wired for sound.

06:27.103 --> 06:29.105
What?
I got it
from a good source.

06:29.105 --> 06:32.608
I thought you should know.
All right?

06:32.608 --> 06:36.112
I'm sorry.
I know you like him.
Like him?

06:36.112 --> 06:41.117
I fuckin'lovehim.
Now, who's your source?

06:41.117 --> 06:44.120
He's on the force.
He's on the task force,
all right?

06:44.620 --> 06:47.623
Look, he's not lyin' to me.
He was in my wedding.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.510
I wanna see the report.
I can't get my hands--

06:50.510 --> 06:53.012
i wanna see
the fuckin' 3- 0- 2!
All right.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.515
All right.
I'll see what i can do.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.639
It doesn't make any sense.

07:03.639 --> 07:08.144
Yeah, it does, ton,
if you take the blinders off.

07:08.277 --> 07:12.782
I'm in robbery/homicide. I was
told he was movin' a lot of "h"
to pay for his kid's college.

07:13.149 --> 07:15.651
Why would i know
something like that?

07:15.651 --> 07:18.654
And last spring,
with that big heroin bust,
where was he?

07:19.038 --> 07:22.041
He told you
he was in las vegas,
am i right?

07:22.041 --> 07:24.544
Again, i'm sorry,
but, yeah,
that's where he was.

07:24.544 --> 07:28.548
He was in las vegas.
He was in a federal building,
cutting a deal.

07:30.049 --> 07:33.052
And why did he walk so easy
from that thing the other day?

07:33.052 --> 07:35.054
"Known wise guy
resisted arrest."

07:35.054 --> 07:39.559
Who walks away
from a thing like that
with low- ball bail?

07:39.559 --> 07:41.561
Why? Why would he do it?
Why?

07:41.928 --> 07:45.932
Because he's facin' a possible
sentence of "from now on."
Mandatory, that's why.

07:46.065 --> 07:49.569
Come on. I know a lot of guys
who can't do that kind of time.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.071
Who is this guy, pussy, huh?
Who is he?

07:52.572 --> 07:55.074
He's a man who loves his family
above all else.

07:55.074 --> 07:58.578
Well, guess what?
That's their favorite target.

08:05.451 --> 08:08.955
No--

08:08.955 --> 08:11.457
okay. That's fine.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.460
I just said it's fine.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.971
Was that my mother?
She's not coming.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.974
You say it like you
expected different.
I hoped.

08:27.974 --> 08:31.477
Every year we have this
open house, and every year
she pulls the same shit.

08:31.477 --> 08:35.481
It's what they call
"negative attention gettin'."
Maybe i should call her back.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.984
That's just what
she wants you to do.
Come here.

08:39.485 --> 08:43.489
You're bein' too nice.
Forget about her.
She'll be fine.

08:43.489 --> 08:47.493
Will you do me a favor?
Can you get the guys to help you
move the piano out of the way?

08:47.493 --> 08:50.496
They're comin' to get it
tomorrow because
some people don't play.

08:50.496 --> 08:54.000
- I will.
- When? It's been gathering
dust here for three months.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.003
Oh, puss, come here.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.506
Excuse me.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.395
- What do you need?
- We're gonna move this.

09:06.512 --> 09:08.514
I wanna slide this
out of the way.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.022
I can't.

09:16.022 --> 09:20.026
What do you mean, you can't?
The fuckin' thing's on wheels.
My back, tony.

09:20.026 --> 09:25.031
I'm thinkin' about goin' home,
sittin' in the tub.
You all right?

09:25.031 --> 09:29.035
Yeah, it's just my back.
They got me on
these elephant pills.

09:33.039 --> 09:36.542
All right.
Go easy on'em.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.045
Go ahead, sit down.
Take it easy.

09:46.302 --> 09:48.304
Listen, i want you
to keep your eye on pussy.

09:48.304 --> 09:50.806
There's somethin'
wrong with him.
He's not himself.

09:50.806 --> 09:52.808
You're tellin' me?

09:52.808 --> 09:55.311
You know, he hasn't even
done his rounds in a week.

09:55.311 --> 09:58.314
He's startin' to look
like an easy mark.
I told him,

09:58.314 --> 10:02.318
"if someone owes you money,
even if you gotta crawl,
you get it."

10:02.318 --> 10:06.822
I even told him to give me his
list on who owes what, and i'll
collect the fuckin' thing.

10:06.822 --> 10:10.326
What'd he say?
He just nodded
like a fuckin' retard.

10:10.326 --> 10:12.328
Yeah, it's those
fuckin' percs.

10:12.328 --> 10:14.330
He's throwin' them
in his mouth
like they're m&ms.

10:14.830 --> 10:17.333
And there isn't even anything
wrong with his back.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.835
What do you mean?

10:19.835 --> 10:24.340
Remember when that guy hit me
in the head with that pool cue,
and i fucked my neck up?

10:24.340 --> 10:27.843
Yeah, down at the shore.
Right. I went
to this doctor.

10:27.843 --> 10:31.847
This guy works on the jets'
front line when they get hurt.

10:31.847 --> 10:34.350
Yeah, he's fuckin' like
the jonas salk of backs.

10:34.850 --> 10:37.853
Anyway, i send pussy
to this doctor.

10:37.853 --> 10:42.858
The guy gives him the works--
m. R. I. S, cat scans,
dog scans, you name it.

10:42.858 --> 10:45.861
He says there's not
a fuckin' thing wrong
with his back.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.751
Then again, he says, uh,
when it comes to backs,

10:51.751 --> 10:54.253
nobody knows anything, really.

10:54.253 --> 10:58.174
You know, i was on a good run,
and then, boom.

10:58.174 --> 11:01.177
I don't know. It's like
i'm walking down the street,

11:01.177 --> 11:06.182
and i'm looking up,
because i feel like a safe's
gonna land on my head.

11:06.182 --> 11:08.184
A feeling of pending doom?

11:08.684 --> 11:11.187
Let me ask you a question.

11:11.187 --> 11:15.191
This mental stuff can cause
physical problems, right?

11:15.191 --> 11:17.693
Are you having
any physical problems?

11:17.693 --> 11:20.196
No, no, i'm fine.

11:20.196 --> 11:22.698
But i got a friend,

11:22.698 --> 11:26.702
a dear, dear friend,
and i'm concerned about him.

11:26.702 --> 11:30.706
- What's wrong with him?
- It's his back.

11:30.706 --> 11:34.210
See, he-- he's complaining
about his back,

11:34.210 --> 11:36.712
but i think the doctor thinks
it's all in his head.

11:36.712 --> 11:39.215
That's very possible.

11:39.215 --> 11:41.717
What do you think?

11:41.717 --> 11:45.721
- I think we should
just keep this about you.
- This is about me.

11:46.222 --> 11:50.726
Every time i offer my opinion
about any of your friends,

11:50.726 --> 11:54.730
it seems to interfere
with our therapy.

11:54.730 --> 11:58.734
You start cursing
and screaming.

12:00.236 --> 12:03.739
What kind of mental stuff
would cause a backache?

12:03.739 --> 12:07.743
- For conversation's sake?
- Absolutely.

12:10.246 --> 12:12.748
With some people,
the pain is...

12:13.249 --> 12:17.253
caused by more responsibility
than they can handle.

12:17.253 --> 12:22.758
Well, that makes sense.
I mean, he's got a lot of bills,

12:22.758 --> 12:24.760
a lot of problems
with his kid's school fund.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.763
Secrets.

12:28.764 --> 12:30.766
What do you mean?

12:30.766 --> 12:34.770
Psychologically, a secret
is a heavy load.

12:34.770 --> 12:39.275
It leads to feelings of guilt
which further burden the mind.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.406
If you want my opinion,
this can't be true.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.408
Thanks, debbie.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.916
You know, i told you
that i would do what i could,

13:03.916 --> 13:08.888
but this is d. E. A. ,
feds, task force.

13:10.339 --> 13:12.341
This is not as easy
as you think--

13:12.341 --> 13:14.810
gettin' my hands
on the 3- 0- 2.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.762
Now, you listen to me.

13:16.762 --> 13:20.266
This is the most serious
fuckin' decision i've ever
had to make in my life,

13:20.266 --> 13:22.768
and i need proof.

13:22.768 --> 13:26.272
I'm not gonna hurt
a man that i love
because of some cop gossip...

13:26.272 --> 13:29.275
from a degenerate fuckin'
gambler with a badge,
you understand me?

13:29.275 --> 13:32.778
You know, you got
the amazing ability...

13:32.778 --> 13:36.782
to sum up a man's whole life
in a single sentence.

13:36.782 --> 13:40.286
"Degenerate gambler
with a badge," huh?

13:40.786 --> 13:44.790
- You're a pisser.
You're a real pisser.
- Oh, i'm sorry.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.794
I'm under a little bit
of pressure here. I don't
have time to suck your dick!

13:48.794 --> 13:50.796
- Apology accepted.
- Fuck you!

13:50.796 --> 13:52.798
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you!

13:55.801 --> 13:58.304
You know, when i was a kid--

13:58.304 --> 14:02.308
when i was a kid and my old man
would be in one of his ways,

14:02.308 --> 14:04.810
with the screamin'
back and forth,

14:05.311 --> 14:08.814
eventually it'd end
with her throwin'
the closest thing to her,

14:08.814 --> 14:11.317
and he'd smack her around!

14:12.818 --> 14:15.321
I don't know why,

14:15.321 --> 14:19.825
but i would run into my room
and i would hide under my bed.

14:20.326 --> 14:25.331
There was somethin' peaceful,
and there was somethin' safe
under that bed.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.335
And that's where i would
wake up the next day.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.806
Everything back to normal.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.808
How about you, tony?

14:37.309 --> 14:39.812
Do you ever feel
like hidin' under a bed?

14:41.814 --> 14:44.316
Yeah. Right now.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.824
Oh, you're a prick
to the end, right?

14:58.330 --> 15:00.332
You really
like this place, huh?

15:00.332 --> 15:02.835
It's my getaway.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.838
This is where debbie's
taken care of me for years.

15:05.838 --> 15:10.342
- I'll bet she has.
- I'm serious, she has.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.846
I mean, there were times when
i'd be havin' a great weekend
with the football, you know,

15:14.346 --> 15:16.348
and i would come in here
with a pocketful of money,
shitfaced,

15:16.849 --> 15:21.353
and every friggin', fuckin'
penny of it would be there
when i got up in the morning.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.356
She is an honest lady.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.359
She'd do anything for you.
Anything.
Come on.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.362
You come in here,
you flash your badge,
you get some free pussy.

15:30.362 --> 15:34.867
Fuckin' pussy.
I wouldn't fuck one of
these broads with your dick.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.871
They have absolutely no class,
and they're always
on the hustle.

15:39.121 --> 15:41.490
That's kind of what they're
supposed to do, no?

15:54.887 --> 15:57.389
"Oh, hello, carmela.
How nice to see you."

15:59.391 --> 16:02.394
How are you feeling?
Oh, what can i say?

16:02.394 --> 16:04.897
What's that?
Uh, it's a "rigot" pie.

16:04.897 --> 16:08.400
I saved it from the open house.
Are you wearing makeup?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.903
I can't eat that.
It's got cholesterol.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.405
I made it with
the low- fat cheese.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.408
Yuck!

16:17.409 --> 16:20.412
Well, maybe
your friends'll eat it.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.915
What friends?

16:22.915 --> 16:25.417
Fine, you can eat it
when junior visits.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.423
You know, ma, your son
loves you very much.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.926
He worries all the time.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.929
He felt bad that you
didn't come to the open house.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.932
And i don't care if you think
it's disrespectful,

16:39.932 --> 16:41.934
but i want you
to cut the drama.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.937
- It's killing tony.
- What are you talking about?

16:45.054 --> 16:48.557
I'm talking about this
"poor mother, nobody loves me"
victim crap.

16:48.557 --> 16:53.445
It is textbook manipulation,
and i hate seeing tony
so upset over it.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.948
I know how
to talk to people.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.818
Well, i am a mother too,
don't forget.

16:59.818 --> 17:03.205
And you know the power
that you have,
and you use it like a pro.

17:03.205 --> 17:05.207
Power? What?
What power?

17:05.207 --> 17:07.710
I don't have power.
I'm a shut- in!

17:07.710 --> 17:10.963
You are bigger than life!
You are his mother!

17:10.963 --> 17:13.464
I don't think for one second
you don't know what
you're doin' to him.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.468
Who, me? Me?
What did i--
what did i do?

17:16.835 --> 17:19.838
Look, i didn't come by
to argue.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.342
I came by to check on you
and to bring you the rigot.

17:23.842 --> 17:28.347
If you don't want it,
you can give it to junior,
'cause i know he stops by a lot.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.349
He's my husband's brother.

17:30.599 --> 17:33.602
He can't check up on me
once in a while?

17:33.602 --> 17:35.604
It's none of
anybody's business.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.489
Oh, my god.
I am not saying that.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.492
All i'm saying is,
if you don't want it,
give it to junior.

17:40.609 --> 17:42.611
I know what
you're hinting at.

17:42.861 --> 17:46.248
Ma, there is nothing wrong
with companionship!

17:50.002 --> 17:53.622
- What is wrong?
-

17:55.124 --> 18:00.129
oh. Wait until
you're abandoned.

18:00.129 --> 18:03.766
Oh!

18:04.767 --> 18:06.769
Abandoned? Please!

18:10.522 --> 18:16.028
When johnny was alive,
nobody treated me like this.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.398
What are you talking about?
Who is treating you bad?

18:19.398 --> 18:21.900
Tony would rather die
than see you hurt!

18:22.034 --> 18:25.904
- Johnny was a saint.
- Yes, we have heard.

18:25.904 --> 18:29.792
Funny, though, i don't remember
you telling him that
when he was alive.

18:29.792 --> 18:33.295
Junior couldn't carry
johnny's socks.

18:33.295 --> 18:36.298
Do you think i'd blacken
my johnny's memory...

18:36.298 --> 18:38.801
by getting mixed up
with his brother?

18:39.301 --> 18:41.303
Oh, jeez.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.055
I didn't say that.

18:43.555 --> 18:47.059
All i'm saying is that we
are happy that you and junior
get along so well.

18:47.059 --> 18:51.563
Well, at least with junior, i--

18:51.563 --> 18:55.067
i've got some purpose in life.

18:55.184 --> 18:59.938
Somebody listens to me
and doesn't treat me
like an old shoe.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.447
Jesus!

19:10.949 --> 19:14.703
Don't worry about the dish.
I'll come back tomorrow
and get it.

19:21.210 --> 19:23.712
Oh, tony.
Hey, college boy!

19:27.716 --> 19:29.718
Yo, dad,
it's uncle tony.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.976
There he is,
the beached whale.

19:37.976 --> 19:40.479
Hey, tony,
what are you doin' here?

19:40.479 --> 19:44.483
I figured you'd be havin'
a cannoli withdrawal by now.
Spinelli's?

19:44.867 --> 19:47.369
No, stop'n shop.
What do you think?

19:47.369 --> 19:50.873
Hey, you're the best.
Kev, put those on a dish.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.625
Wait till after supper.

19:54.126 --> 19:58.130
So, your father tells me you're
takin' up astronomy in college.
No, business.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.884
How come he keeps sayin'
you're takin' up space
in school?

20:02.384 --> 20:06.388
Madron, don't make me laugh.
It kills my back.

20:06.388 --> 20:09.391
He's a good- lookin' kid.
Sure he's yours?

20:09.391 --> 20:12.394
You're lucky my wife's not home.
She'd toss you out for that.
She doesn't play.

20:12.895 --> 20:15.898
I know.
He's a good boy, tony.

20:16.265 --> 20:18.767
I pray to god i keep that
fuckin' tuition comin' in.

20:19.268 --> 20:20.769
Hey, the kid can always
go to city college.

20:21.270 --> 20:26.024
This kid's stayin' right where
he is. He isn't gettin' fucked
'cause his old man is!

20:28.277 --> 20:32.531
You ought to relax.
You ought to take it
easy a little.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.033
"Take it easy."
How the fuck can i
take it easy?

20:35.534 --> 20:37.035
Things are happenin', tony.

20:37.536 --> 20:41.039
What kind of things?
Things!

20:42.541 --> 20:45.794
This fuckin' back has taken me
out of the game.
I'm way behind.

20:45.794 --> 20:49.298
And top it off,
i think i'm gettin' hooked
on these fuckin' painkillers.

20:49.798 --> 20:52.801
I don't know.
I feel like someone
put themaloikon me.

20:55.437 --> 20:59.942
Puss, you got options.

20:59.942 --> 21:05.447
Don't let anyone make you feel
like you don't have any options,
'cause you got friends--

21:05.447 --> 21:08.951
look at me-- friends
that would die for you.

21:08.951 --> 21:10.953
You understand me?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.205
Friends.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.208
Yeah, i know.

21:19.828 --> 21:22.714
You got anything
you want to say to me?

21:24.216 --> 21:26.218
Like what?

21:29.338 --> 21:32.474
Like,"you want some coffee,
tony? You want
somethin' to eat?"

21:32.474 --> 21:34.476
You want coffee?
Yeah.

21:34.726 --> 21:38.730
What do you think,
i'm gonna let you eat all those
fuckin' cannolis by yourself?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.732
- You beached whale.
- Here.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.236
What?
Help me up. You want coffee?
Who's gonna make it, you?

21:44.236 --> 21:46.238
One, two, three.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.241
You look good.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.243
Yeah.

22:13.015 --> 22:15.517
What's up, t?

22:15.517 --> 22:17.519
Sit.

22:19.021 --> 22:23.025
Fuckin' traffic.
I would've been here
20 minutes ago.

22:25.027 --> 22:27.029
Want a drink?
Nah.

22:29.031 --> 22:31.033
You okay?

22:34.536 --> 22:37.539
- He's wearin' a wire.
- Who?

22:37.539 --> 22:42.544
- Pussy.
- Oh, get the fuck outta here.
Our pussy?

22:43.045 --> 22:45.547
Don't know how long.

22:45.547 --> 22:50.552
- Are you sure
about this, tony?
- Ninety percent.

22:52.554 --> 22:54.056
Not enough to do
what needs to be done.

22:54.556 --> 22:57.559
Aw, jesus, tony,
i'm fuckin' dreamin' here.

22:57.559 --> 22:59.561
Well, get used to it.

22:59.561 --> 23:02.064
I've been walkin'
into walls all week.

23:08.070 --> 23:10.072
I'll do it.

23:15.077 --> 23:18.080
It's my responsibility.
Tony,

23:18.580 --> 23:20.582
you waited a long time
for the stripes.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.085
This is one of the perks.

23:23.585 --> 23:25.087
I'll do it.

23:33.595 --> 23:37.599
We need to be
110 percent sure.

23:37.599 --> 23:40.102
I want you to see it.

23:40.102 --> 23:43.105
I want you to see
that fuckin' wire
strapped on his body!

23:43.105 --> 23:47.109
I want you to see it.
You hear me?

23:47.109 --> 23:50.112
I want you to see it.

23:50.112 --> 23:53.115
Otherwise,
all bets are off.

23:53.482 --> 23:54.983
You understand?

23:57.619 --> 24:02.124
No. This is our friend
we're talkin' about here.

24:02.624 --> 24:04.626
You say it.

24:04.626 --> 24:06.745
You understand?

24:07.746 --> 24:09.881
I understand.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.271
Come in.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.775
Mr. Soprano.

24:37.776 --> 24:41.279
Are you busy?
No, no, no.
Come in, please.

24:44.282 --> 24:48.787
I was in the neighborhood,
figured i'd stop by
and see my mother.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.290
Brought her
some mario lanza.

24:52.290 --> 24:56.294
She, uh, loves
the old guys.

24:58.797 --> 25:02.801
I'm a little worried about her.
You know, she's always
been depressed.

25:03.301 --> 25:07.305
Sometimes these
half- assed tenors
can really do the trick.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.313
You know where she is?
She's not in her room.

25:15.313 --> 25:18.316
I wanted to tell her
her house went into escrow.

25:18.817 --> 25:22.320
She's with the other girls
getting aqua therapy.
My mother?

25:22.320 --> 25:26.324
The physical therapist told her
if she didn't get any exercise,

25:26.825 --> 25:29.077
her back was gonna arch
like an old lady.

25:29.077 --> 25:31.079
I didn't even know
she owned a bathing suit.

25:31.213 --> 25:33.215
She's more connected
to the world.

25:33.331 --> 25:34.833
Which one?
This one or neptune?

25:35.333 --> 25:38.837
No, really.

25:39.337 --> 25:42.974
I think your uncle's visits
has a lot to do with it.

25:42.974 --> 25:45.477
Oh, she looks forward
to them.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.980
- Oh, could you excuse me
one moment?
- Yeah, sure.

25:48.980 --> 25:52.984
No, just, uh, tell her
her house sold,

25:52.984 --> 25:55.487
and they accepted
the counteroffer.
Hello?

25:55.487 --> 25:58.490
Okay. Yeah,
i'll be right there.

25:58.740 --> 26:00.742
I'm leavin', guys.
All right, pussy.
I'll see you later.

26:00.742 --> 26:02.744
Feel better.
I'll tell ya if that horse
is runnin'.

26:03.245 --> 26:05.497
Don't do me any favors.
I gotta take off.
I'll see ya.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.781
- Follow me.
- Where?

26:40.282 --> 26:41.783
It's a surprise.

26:44.286 --> 26:46.288
Come on, ya hard- on,
before we get a ticket.

26:58.667 --> 27:01.670
Paulie, i been here before.
What the fuck you want?

27:02.170 --> 27:04.172
Look around.
I'll give you three guesses.

27:04.673 --> 27:06.174
Come on, down here.

27:10.178 --> 27:12.180
We'll grab a rubdown after.

27:12.681 --> 27:14.683
Here.

27:16.184 --> 27:20.689
I don't know.
Come on, get undressed.
It's on me.

27:21.189 --> 27:23.191
Why do you think
those russian leaders
live so long?

27:23.692 --> 27:27.195
They take ashvitz
every day.
I can't.

27:27.696 --> 27:30.699
Now, don't be like that.
It's a gift.
Take your clothes off.

27:31.199 --> 27:33.201
What? You want me
to turn around?

27:33.201 --> 27:37.205
The doctor said heat's no good
for me. I gotta avoid it.
That's why i sit in the shade.

27:37.706 --> 27:39.207
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

27:39.708 --> 27:42.711
Heat is good for your back.
Take your clothes off.

27:42.711 --> 27:46.214
Look, paulie, i appreciate it,
but maybe another time, huh?

27:46.715 --> 27:49.217
Take your clothes off.

27:50.719 --> 27:53.722
You're fuckin' crazy.
I'm goin' home.

27:55.724 --> 27:57.726
Why don't you wanna
take your clothes off?

27:59.227 --> 28:01.730
I got high blood pressure,
you fuckin' idiot.

28:01.730 --> 28:03.732
I go in there,
i could check the fuck out.

28:03.732 --> 28:06.735
My doctor mentioned
steam and sauna
specifically as no- no's!

28:07.235 --> 28:09.738
He said stay the fuck
away from heat!

28:10.739 --> 28:14.743
Thanks for the thought,
but get out of my fuckin' face.

28:36.398 --> 28:41.903
What'd you find out?
It's good.
It's fuckin' very good.

28:41.903 --> 28:44.406
Spit it out.

28:44.406 --> 28:48.410
He's into pussy, big.
I mean, with a capital "b."

28:48.910 --> 28:52.914
This fuckin' makazian,
he's a lyin' motherfucker.

28:52.914 --> 28:55.417
He's into pussy for,
like, 30 large.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.419
Twenty grand
just on football.

28:57.919 --> 28:59.921
Uh, the rest is shy.

28:59.921 --> 29:03.425
Pussy must be burying
this prick in vig alone.

29:10.932 --> 29:12.934
It doesn't mean
he's a liar.

29:12.934 --> 29:17.439
It just means he's got
a reason to see pussy dead.
It buys him time.

29:19.441 --> 29:23.445
Could this prick have the balls
to try somethin' like this?

29:23.445 --> 29:25.947
Hey, we're talkin' about
30 grand here.

29:26.448 --> 29:29.951
I don't even wanna think about
what me and you would do
to remove that debt.

29:29.951 --> 29:31.953
I wouldn't bet football.

29:35.957 --> 29:38.460
I gotta think about this.

29:39.461 --> 29:43.965
Look, t, if my vote
counts for anything,

29:43.965 --> 29:49.971
i cannot believe that pussy
would fear the can enough
to hurt his friends.

29:51.473 --> 29:54.976
That's what they said
about gravano.

29:57.979 --> 30:00.482
All right. Go back in.
I gotta think.

30:13.661 --> 30:15.663
Deb?

30:17.665 --> 30:19.667
Debbie?

30:27.792 --> 30:30.795
Why don't you take it easy?
I would think a whore
would like a little pain.

30:31.296 --> 30:32.797
Come on!
Take it easy!
Vinnie, stop it!

30:33.298 --> 30:35.800
Let's get this show
on the road!
Look at this.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.303
A doctor, a madam,
wise guy and a cop.

30:38.303 --> 30:41.940
That's what i call
a vice superfecta.

30:46.945 --> 30:50.198
The four were arrested
last night. A police
spokesman says...

30:50.198 --> 30:53.701
that the officer in question
will be placed on
administrative leave,

30:53.701 --> 30:56.204
pending the outcome
of the hearing
set for this morning.

30:56.454 --> 30:58.456
I'd hate to have been there
when he got home.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.458
I don't know which
is more embarrassing--

31:00.458 --> 31:03.962
to be caught in a bordello
or to be caught
with the wise guy.

31:03.962 --> 31:06.965
Meanwhile, there was a fire--
asshole.

31:07.081 --> 31:10.084
What's a bordello?
It's a fancy name
for a whorehouse.

31:10.084 --> 31:12.837
- Don't start, okay?
- It is.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.973
Yeah, i know it is.
I just don't like that talk.

31:15.089 --> 31:17.592
This country's light years
behind the rest of the world.
Most civilized countries...

31:17.592 --> 31:20.595
have legalized prostitution.
Don't you got
somewhere to be?

31:21.095 --> 31:23.097
It's a joke.
Look what they're putting
the president through.

31:23.231 --> 31:27.735
- He deserved what he got.
- He got monica "kazinski" and
the broad with the long nose.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.988
I just don't think sex
should be a punishable offense.

31:30.355 --> 31:33.358
That's where i agree with you.
I don't think sex should be
a punishable offense either.

31:33.741 --> 31:37.745
I do think that talkin'
about sex at the breakfast table
isa punishable offense.

31:37.745 --> 31:40.865
- So no more sex talk, okay?
- It's the 90s.

31:40.865 --> 31:43.751
Parents are supposed
to discuss sex
with their children.

31:43.751 --> 31:45.753
Yeah, but that's where
you're wrong.

31:45.753 --> 31:48.256
You see, out there
it's the 1990s,

31:48.256 --> 31:52.260
but in this house
it's 1954.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.879
1990s. 1954.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.883
So now and forever,
i don't wanna hear
any more sex talk, okay?

32:03.388 --> 32:05.390
What's with him?

32:05.523 --> 32:07.525
Come on! Let's go!

32:10.028 --> 32:14.032
Come on, come on!
Come on, you lame- ass driver!

32:15.400 --> 32:17.902
Keep moving, please.

32:18.403 --> 32:19.904
Come on!

32:20.405 --> 32:22.907
Move it!
Where do you want me to go?

32:25.410 --> 32:28.913
- Goddamn it!
- Come on, pull up!

32:38.172 --> 32:40.174
Come on, goddamn it!

32:40.174 --> 32:44.679
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

32:52.320 --> 32:55.823
Oh, go right ahead, detective.
Excuse me. Move it out, please.

32:56.074 --> 32:59.694
Got a police officer here.
Move it out!

32:59.694 --> 33:01.696
Let's go. Pull up.

33:02.196 --> 33:03.698
Come on.

33:04.198 --> 33:06.200
Police vehicle comin' through!

33:52.997 --> 33:56.000
Are you sure?
Who told you this?

33:57.502 --> 34:02.006
What?

34:05.009 --> 34:08.513
Yeah. Yeah, i'm still here.

34:08.513 --> 34:12.016
All right, thanks.
I'll talk to you later.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.522
You gonna tell me?

34:17.522 --> 34:21.025
The fuckin' jerk did a header
off the road one bridge.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.027
Who?
Makazian.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.531
Fuck!

34:27.031 --> 34:30.918
There goes our only shot
to find out for sure
the truth about pussy.

34:33.920 --> 34:38.926
Well, if it matters,
he always said how much
he respected you.

34:38.926 --> 34:40.928
It matters.

34:43.931 --> 34:46.434
He helped me out
of a lot of jams.

34:46.434 --> 34:48.803
Not just with the law.

34:50.304 --> 34:52.806
What the fuck was he thinkin'?
He could've kept his job.

34:52.806 --> 34:55.309
He might've been suspended,
that's all.

34:55.309 --> 34:57.311
It wasn't like
he was dealin'.

34:57.311 --> 34:59.814
That's not why he did it.

34:59.814 --> 35:01.816
Don't get me wrong,
it was the straw.

35:01.816 --> 35:05.820
But he was not happy...

35:05.820 --> 35:09.323
with himself,
how he turned out.

35:09.323 --> 35:11.826
What did he
come here for, therapy?

35:11.826 --> 35:13.828
You could say that.

35:13.828 --> 35:17.832
Instead of a couch
you use a bed?
It's not a bad deal.

35:17.832 --> 35:20.835
Hey, who wouldn't want
to sleep with their shrink?

35:23.838 --> 35:25.840
What does that mean?

35:27.842 --> 35:30.845
You would be amazed
how much easier it is
to open up when you're naked...

35:31.345 --> 35:33.848
and in the arms of someone
who cares for you.

35:33.848 --> 35:39.353
Did he ever...mention anything
about my guys to you?

35:39.353 --> 35:41.856
He didn't like paulie.

35:41.856 --> 35:43.858
He thought he was a psycho.

35:43.858 --> 35:49.363
- What about pussy?
- He really didn't have much
to say about any of you guys.

35:52.366 --> 35:54.869
Except that he
owed some money.

35:54.869 --> 35:57.872
He wasn't worried
because you liked him,

35:58.873 --> 36:01.375
and as long as he had you
in his corner,

36:01.876 --> 36:03.377
there was nothing
really to worry about.

36:04.879 --> 36:06.881
I'm not gonna lie
'cause he's dead.

36:06.881 --> 36:10.384
He didn't have a good thing
to say about anybody,

36:10.384 --> 36:12.887
but he did feel like
he could trust you, tony.

36:15.890 --> 36:20.394
He said many times,
"at least with tony soprano,
you know where you stand."

36:29.153 --> 36:32.657
Livia, open up.
It's junior.

36:32.657 --> 36:36.544
Come on in.
It's open.

36:38.546 --> 36:40.548
What's goin' on?

36:40.548 --> 36:43.417
My dominican girl
said you called me.

36:43.417 --> 36:48.422
Well, he sold our house.

36:48.422 --> 36:50.925
Don't people
have names anymore?
Who's "he"?

36:50.925 --> 36:54.929
Anthony.
He sold my house--

36:54.929 --> 36:58.432
the home that
my husband and i made!

36:58.432 --> 37:00.935
What else were they
gonna do with it?

37:00.935 --> 37:02.937
You too?

37:02.937 --> 37:05.940
Hey!

37:06.440 --> 37:10.444
I suppose he would've found it
harder to have his meetings
atmyhouse...

37:10.945 --> 37:12.947
than in this nursing home.

37:12.947 --> 37:14.949
What are you talkin' about,
"meetings"?

37:15.333 --> 37:18.336
Don't think i'll ever
see any of that money either.

37:18.836 --> 37:22.089
- What meetings?
- Raymond, larry,

37:22.340 --> 37:25.343
that sneak from manhattan.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.345
Johnny sack?
Johnny sack was here?

37:27.345 --> 37:30.848
With his mohair suits
and his shoe lifts.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.851
Suits? Pleurisy?

37:33.851 --> 37:37.355
More than once he was here?
Why didn't i know about this?

37:37.355 --> 37:40.858
Well, maybe it was you
they were talking about.
Who knows?

37:48.866 --> 37:53.371
I just don't like being put
in the middle of things.

37:54.372 --> 37:57.375
I should've known
something was strange...

37:57.375 --> 38:02.380
when suddenly larry boy's mother
moved in here...

38:02.380 --> 38:05.383
and then
jimmy altieri's mother.

38:05.883 --> 38:08.135
Three of mycappos
have their mothers
in this place?

38:08.135 --> 38:13.641
Instead of living in
normal homes with their sons,
like human beings.

38:13.641 --> 38:17.144
This must be some kind
of fuckin' end move.

38:17.144 --> 38:19.146
What, do they think
i'm stupid?

38:19.146 --> 38:21.899
We'll see.
Now, wait a minute.

38:23.150 --> 38:25.653
I don't like
that kind of talk.

38:25.653 --> 38:28.656
Now, just stop it.
It upsets me.

38:30.157 --> 38:32.159
Or i won't tell you
anything anymore.

38:32.660 --> 38:35.162
If this is true, livia,
you know what i--

38:35.162 --> 38:37.164
i mean--

38:37.164 --> 38:39.166
i'm divorced,
for christ's sake!

38:39.166 --> 38:41.669
If i don't act,
blood or no--

38:50.177 --> 38:52.680
i have to!
Oh, god!

38:53.180 --> 38:57.184
What-- what did i say now?

39:03.190 --> 39:08.195
I suppose i should have
just kept my mouth shut,
like a mute,

39:08.195 --> 39:11.699
and then everybody
would have been happy.

39:22.543 --> 39:24.545
Anthony, go see
who's at the door.

39:24.545 --> 39:27.548
- I'm eating.
- But you won't have any teeth
left to eat with...

39:27.548 --> 39:29.550
if you don't get off your ass
and see who's at the door.

39:36.057 --> 39:38.559
Make sure you know who it is
before you answer it!

39:38.559 --> 39:41.562
Who is coming at dinnertime?
People can't call?

39:41.562 --> 39:45.066
I don't know.
It's uncle jimmy!

39:45.066 --> 39:48.569
Uncle jimmy?
Let him in!

39:52.323 --> 39:54.825
I don't believe it.
How'd you get out?
Hey.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.328
Carm, look who's here.
It's jimmy. He's out.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.831
Oh, my god! Jimmy!
Thought you'd never
see me again, huh?

40:00.831 --> 40:02.833
So, what happened?
Long story.

40:02.833 --> 40:06.837
You got someplace in private
we can talk?
Yeah, in the basement.

40:10.591 --> 40:12.593
What's goin' on?

40:15.096 --> 40:17.098
You got a problem.

40:18.099 --> 40:21.102
Yeah, i know.
I'm workin' on it.

40:21.102 --> 40:25.106
- Workin' on what?
- Why, what were you gonna say?

40:25.106 --> 40:29.610
- You better lay low
with that safe house money.
- What are you talkin' about?

40:30.111 --> 40:33.114
They were askin' me
a lot of questions
in there, you know?

40:33.114 --> 40:37.618
If i knew anything
about the dead columbian
in the apartment and all that.

40:42.123 --> 40:43.624
You look good.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.127
Thanks. I wasn't
gone that long.

40:46.127 --> 40:49.130
Yeah. Yeah, i know.

40:49.130 --> 40:52.633
My lawyer told him,
"he doesn't own the building.

40:53.134 --> 40:55.636
He's not responsible
for what's in the building."

40:55.636 --> 41:00.141
I told him the pool table
was there when i first
rented the joint.

41:00.141 --> 41:03.644
Good thinkin'.
Missed your callin'.
Should've been a lawyer.

41:03.644 --> 41:05.646
Please.

41:05.646 --> 41:09.150
Enough people hate me.

41:09.150 --> 41:13.404
So, uh, what are you
gonna do about
the columbian money?

41:16.907 --> 41:20.411
They were puttin'
the screws to me
like i was a school kid,

41:20.411 --> 41:22.413
tellin' me that the money
was marked.

41:22.413 --> 41:26.917
They even said that there's
a new fingerprint technique that
lifts'em right off the bills.

41:31.422 --> 41:34.792
- You're a lucky man, jimmy.
- What do you mean?

41:35.292 --> 41:38.929
- You're out on bail on that
conspiracy thing, right?
- Yeah, so?

41:38.929 --> 41:41.432
So only a lucky prick like you
would get pinched with a gun...

41:41.432 --> 41:45.436
while he's out on bail
for something else and still
be out in time for dinner.

41:47.438 --> 41:49.440
You're a lucky guy.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.442
Speakin' of dinner,
carmela's got some lasagna.

41:51.442 --> 41:53.444
You want some?
Come on.
I'll pass.

41:53.444 --> 41:56.447
I still got a few people to see
that are late with payments.
Oh, yeah?

41:56.947 --> 41:59.450
I gotta make sure they
see my face, otherwise they
think they're off the hook.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.452
Yeah, i know how that is.

42:09.076 --> 42:12.580
- Get off the phone!
- I gotta go. What's up?

42:12.580 --> 42:15.082
It's jimmy!
It's fuckin' jimmy!

42:15.583 --> 42:18.586
What?
The wire,
it's fuckin' jimmy!

42:18.586 --> 42:21.589
What are you talkin' about?
The wire.
Do you understand?

42:21.589 --> 42:25.092
The wire,
it's fuckin' jimmy.
Holy shit.

42:25.092 --> 42:29.096
"New fingerprint technique."
I should've killed him
right in my fuckin' basement.

42:29.096 --> 42:32.600
Makazian's guy got his facts
crossed. They both got busted
at the same fuckin' time--

42:32.600 --> 42:35.603
jimmy and pussy,
you understand?

42:37.104 --> 42:40.608
Two fat fucks with black hair.
Where the fuck is paulie?

42:40.991 --> 42:43.994
Uh, he called an hour ago,
i swear to god.
He said he's on his way.

42:44.495 --> 42:46.997
Why the fuck
isn't he here now?

42:48.499 --> 42:50.501
Jesus, tony.

42:50.501 --> 42:53.504
You don't think, uh,
paulie jumped the gun?

42:53.504 --> 42:55.506
Shut up. God forbid.
God forbid.

42:56.006 --> 43:00.511
Don't talk like that.
Where's pussy?
Get him on the phone.

43:01.011 --> 43:04.014
All right. All right.

43:04.014 --> 43:07.768
I haven't seen him since, uh,
paulie took him to theshvitz.

43:07.768 --> 43:10.137
Hey, fellas.

43:11.639 --> 43:14.642
Where the fuck have you been?
I've been calling you
all fuckin' night long!

43:15.142 --> 43:17.645
I was at mygoombahs.
I told silvio i was comin'.

43:17.645 --> 43:20.147
You answer me like
i'm jesus christ himself,

43:20.147 --> 43:23.150
and if you fuckin' lie to me,
may your mother die
of cancer of the eyes.

43:27.154 --> 43:29.657
Where's pussy?
I don't know.

43:29.657 --> 43:32.660
Don't you fuckin'
lie to me.
Tony.

43:35.162 --> 43:37.665
Did you do it?
Tony--

43:37.665 --> 43:41.669
shh. Don't fuckin'
lie to me.

43:43.170 --> 43:46.173
Did you do it?
No.

43:46.173 --> 43:48.175
Did you fuckin' do it?
No.

43:48.676 --> 43:50.177
Did you fuckin' do it?

43:50.678 --> 43:54.682
I said no! Now get
your fuckin' hands off me.

43:54.682 --> 43:58.319
Come on, tony.
Come on.

44:17.838 --> 44:19.957
I'm sorry, paulie.

44:21.959 --> 44:24.962
I can't find pussy anywhere!

44:25.963 --> 44:27.965
Nobody knows anything!

44:28.349 --> 44:32.353
I haven't seen him
since theshvitz.

44:32.353 --> 44:36.857
The last thing
he said to me was,
"go fuck yourself."

44:36.857 --> 44:40.611
Did he at least
take theshvitz?

44:43.113 --> 44:46.367
He refused
to take his clothes off.

44:52.122 --> 44:56.126
The rat,
it's fuckin' jimmy.

45:00.381 --> 45:02.383
Ah, fuck it.

45:02.383 --> 45:04.501
Let's all have a drink.

45:09.757 --> 45:12.893
Easy. Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

45:14.395 --> 45:16.397
All right.

45:16.397 --> 45:18.399
Hey, babe!

45:21.518 --> 45:25.406
- Look what chucky brought us.
- Oh, another kitchen appliance.

45:25.906 --> 45:27.408
Whoop- fuckin'- pee.

45:27.908 --> 45:29.910
Well, slit your wrists,
why don't ya?

45:29.910 --> 45:32.913
A truckload fell off
the loading dock
at zim's last night.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.916
Oh, it's not even
a "bra- oom."

45:35.916 --> 45:38.419
That's a braun, babe.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.671
Junior said for me to tell ya...
yeah?

45:41.171 --> 45:43.674
He's decided...
on that thing.

45:43.674 --> 45:46.677
He said we should
look out of town
for who's gonna do it.

45:46.677 --> 45:48.679
Finally.
Yeah.

45:48.796 --> 45:50.798
Yeah.

45:50.931 --> 45:52.433
It's gonna
be a busy month.
Yeah.

45:52.933 --> 45:55.185
I'll see ya.
All right.
See ya later. All right.

45:55.686 --> 45:57.688
I'll see ya, jo.
Yeah, see ya.

46:02.810 --> 46:06.697

talkin' about?
- Mind your business.

46:07.197 --> 46:10.818
Whatever it is, mikey,
we're goin' to vegas
next month.

46:10.818 --> 46:14.321
I already lined up child care
for frances albert,
so i don't wanna hear it.

46:14.321 --> 46:17.324
Forget it.
Somethin's come up.

46:18.826 --> 46:20.828
Somethin' always comes up.

46:21.078 --> 46:23.330
This is a good somethin'.

46:23.330 --> 46:27.334
I hope it means more money,
'cause i need a new car.
Trust me.

46:27.718 --> 46:31.972
If this goes down,
you're gonna have a new car
and then some.

46:33.223 --> 46:35.726
Can you tell me?

46:35.976 --> 46:38.479
Oh, come on, mikey.
Tell me.

46:38.479 --> 46:40.981
Mm- mmm.
Come on. Please?

46:43.984 --> 46:46.987
I may be gettin' bumped up
a notch or two.

46:46.987 --> 46:51.992
Tony soprano's on his way out,
and i mean as inforever.

46:51.992 --> 46:55.496
Oh, my god!
He's goin' to jail?

46:55.496 --> 46:58.499
No, the other forever.

46:58.499 --> 47:00.501
Does junior know?

47:00.501 --> 47:03.003
Oh, jeez.

47:03.003 --> 47:06.507
Now, listen to me.
If you breathe
a word of this to anybody,

47:06.507 --> 47:10.511

me and you right next
to tony soprano, understand?

47:10.511 --> 47:12.513
Yeah.
Okay.

47:12.513 --> 47:14.515
Make it decaf.

47:19.770 --> 47:23.273
You don't belittle a man
like junior soprano.
He's old school.

47:23.774 --> 47:25.776
You don't joke
about cuntlapping,

47:25.776 --> 47:28.529
and you definitely
don't spill your guts out
to a fuckin' shrink...

47:28.529 --> 47:31.031
about business that isn't
yours to talk about.

47:31.532 --> 47:33.534
Tony soprano sees a shrink?

47:33.534 --> 47:36.537
You fuckin' believe that?
And to add insult to injury,

47:36.537 --> 47:39.039
he was plannin' on makin'
a move against junior.

47:39.540 --> 47:41.658
His own uncle?

47:43.660 --> 47:46.163
Were you this fuckin' stupid
when i married you?

47:46.296 --> 47:49.049
- Oh, fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

47:49.049 --> 47:51.552
