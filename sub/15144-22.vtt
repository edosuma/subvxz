- You guys have nothing

13:05.583 --> 13:07.792
to be sorry about.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.959
You were just trying

13:07.834 --> 13:09.959
to make me feel welcome.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.375
And you did.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.250
I finally feel like

13:11.417 --> 13:14.250
my old bad self again.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.000
- But what about your

13:14.291 --> 13:17.000
new good self?

13:17.041 --> 13:18.375
- Boring.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.083
Just like this lame sweater.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.250
- What's wrong with

13:20.125 --> 13:21.250
that sweater?

13:21.291 --> 13:22.875
It's just like mine.

13:22.917 --> 13:27.667
- It's fine for you,

13:22.917 --> 13:27.667
but I look better in this.

13:27.709 --> 13:28.917
- Whoa.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.834
You do look pretty awesome.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.083
- Thank you.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.583
Now,

13:33.125 --> 13:35.583
let's go break something.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.917
- Wait, aren't you afraid

13:35.625 --> 13:38.917
of getting caught?

13:38.959 --> 13:41.041
Remember?

13:38.959 --> 13:41.041
Boarding school?

13:41.083 --> 13:42.875
- I'm not gonna

13:41.083 --> 13:42.875
get caught.

13:42.917 --> 13:45.625
So you with me?

13:45.667 --> 13:48.917
We can do a lot of damage

13:45.667 --> 13:48.917
before homeroom.

13:48.959 --> 13:53.125
- Uh, no, thanks. I'm kind of a

13:48.959 --> 13:53.125
"by the rules" kind of guy.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.875
- Me too, but

13:53.166 --> 13:54.875
thanks for asking.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.667
- I've got a spotless record,

13:54.917 --> 13:58.667
so no can do.

13:58.709 --> 14:02.583
- I would, but these three

13:58.709 --> 14:02.583
get kind of judge-y.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.792
- I knew you guys

14:02.625 --> 14:04.792
weren't really bad.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.375
- Hold on;

14:04.834 --> 14:06.375
we're too bad

14:06.417 --> 14:07.792
to hang out with you

14:06.417 --> 14:07.792
when you're good,

14:07.834 --> 14:10.458
but when you're bad,

14:07.834 --> 14:10.458
we're not bad enough?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.291
- Pretty much.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.291
See ya.

14:13.333 --> 14:14.750
- This is terrible.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.875
- She's gonna get caught.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.875
- And sent away.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.166
- And it's our fault

14:16.917 --> 14:19.166
she turned bad again.

14:19.208 --> 14:20.834
So we need to do

14:19.208 --> 14:20.834
the right thing:

14:20.875 --> 14:23.834
follow her around and stop her

14:20.875 --> 14:23.834
from doing the wrong thing.

14:23.875 --> 14:25.375
- So we can get into

14:23.875 --> 14:25.375
that tree house.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.750
- Yeah.

14:25.417 --> 14:26.750
- Totally.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.583
- I can't wait.

14:28.625 --> 14:31.208
- Not like that is

14:28.625 --> 14:31.208
the only reason that we want to

14:28.625 --> 14:31.208
be friends with her.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.709
- Yeah.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.709
- No.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.041
- Of course not.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.834
- [gasps]

14:36.166 --> 14:37.834
Uh-oh.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.000
Syd's on the

14:37.875 --> 14:39.000
library table.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.166
- What is she doing?

14:41.208 --> 14:45.583
- I'm not sure if it's

14:41.208 --> 14:45.583
a whip or a nae nae, but I'm

14:41.208 --> 14:45.583
certain it's a no-no.

14:45.625 --> 14:48.083
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

14:49.625 --> 14:51.834
- I lost Syd in the cafeteria.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.834
Have you guys seen her?

14:51.875 --> 14:54.834
- No, but I think she drew a

14:51.875 --> 14:54.834
moustache on the lunch lady.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.750
- That was already there.

14:56.792 --> 15:01.291
- Well, that's good news for us

14:56.792 --> 15:01.291
but bad news for Mr. Lunch Lady.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.041
- I don't see how

15:01.333 --> 15:03.041
we can keep this up.

15:03.083 --> 15:06.500
I've already been tardy

15:03.083 --> 15:06.500
to two classes.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.583
I don't do tardy.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.625
- Hey, guys.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.625
- Have you seen Syd?

15:11.667 --> 15:14.000
- Not since

15:11.667 --> 15:14.000
Mr. Williams' class.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.250
Have you guys noticed that she

15:14.041 --> 15:16.250
seems different today?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.291
- No.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.291
- Didn't notice.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.583
- The same old Syd.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.166
- We didn't do a thing

15:18.625 --> 15:20.166
to change her.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.333
- Dicky.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.125
- Speaking of Mr. Williams,

15:23.166 --> 15:26.000
did you hear someone stole

15:23.166 --> 15:26.000
his answer book?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.709
- Guys, this is not good.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.458
- No, it is good.

15:27.750 --> 15:31.458
He cancelled tomorrow's test.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.208
Now I have time

15:31.500 --> 15:33.208
to paint my kitty's claws

15:33.250 --> 15:35.041
before her birthday party.

15:35.083 --> 15:39.166
It's her cats-eañera.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.000
- Okay, I know

15:39.208 --> 15:41.000
Syd is a bad kid,

15:41.041 --> 15:44.583
but I don't think she'd do

15:41.041 --> 15:44.583
something this bad.

15:44.625 --> 15:48.208
- Yeah, there's no way

15:44.625 --> 15:48.208
she stole the answer book.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.333
She stole the answer book.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.709
- And now she's climbing

15:51.375 --> 15:53.709
back down without it.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.709
She hid it

15:53.750 --> 15:55.709
in the tree house.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.208
If she gets caught

15:55.750 --> 15:57.208
with that book,

15:57.250 --> 15:58.792
it's "hello, boarding school"

15:57.250 --> 15:58.792
for her

15:58.834 --> 16:00.834
and "good-bye,

15:58.834 --> 16:00.834
tree house" for us.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.959
- But again, it's not like

16:00.875 --> 16:02.959
that's the only reason

16:03.000 --> 16:04.250
we want to

16:03.000 --> 16:04.250
be friends with her.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.250
- Yeah.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.250
- No.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.333
- Of course not.

16:08.542 --> 16:11.166
- Did you have to

16:08.542 --> 16:11.166
take a bath now?

16:11.208 --> 16:13.625
- I was here first.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.625
- Okay, I'm gonna run over to

16:13.667 --> 16:15.625
Syd's and get that book back

16:15.667 --> 16:17.208
so Mr. Williams

16:15.667 --> 16:17.208
doesn't find out.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.875
- Why do you get to be the one

16:17.250 --> 16:19.875
who goes in the tree house?

16:19.917 --> 16:23.875
- Because I'm the only one

16:19.917 --> 16:23.875
wearing socks and shoes.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.375
- Good.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.375
She's gone.

What are you

We were only spying on you

this answer book back

18:03.583 --> 18:05.458

19:50.000 --> 19:51.458
The four of you are lucky.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.083
You look out for each other.

19:54.959 --> 19:57.875
I guess I'm lucky you've been

19:54.959 --> 19:57.875
looking out for me.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.917
- Hey, that's what

19:57.917 --> 20:00.917
friends do for each other.

20:00.959 --> 20:04.000
- Guys, look at this place.

20:00.959 --> 20:04.000
- Yeah, it's amazing.

20:04.041 --> 20:07.083
- Look at all the

20:04.041 --> 20:07.083
smart storage solutions.

20:07.125 --> 20:10.000
- Hey, there's five

20:07.125 --> 20:10.000
of us up here.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.834
- Huh.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.834
My Dad was wrong.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.208
This thing can hold

20:11.875 --> 20:14.208
more than two people.

20:14.250 --> 20:17.500
Guess the tree's stronger

20:14.250 --> 20:17.500
than he thought.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.500
all: Aww.

20:19.542 --> 20:20.667
[creaking]

20:20.709 --> 20:21.792
- What was that?

20:21.834 --> 20:23.875
[rumbling]

20:30.083 --> 20:31.417
- Wow.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.375
Fell to the ground,

20:31.458 --> 20:33.375
and it's--

20:33.417 --> 20:34.875
it's still

20:33.417 --> 20:34.875
in one piece.

20:34.917 --> 20:36.875
- I guess it's not

20:34.917 --> 20:36.875
a total disaster.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.333
- Yeah.

20:39.375 --> 20:40.792
- What?

20:48.834 --> 20:52.625
- Now it's

20:48.834 --> 20:52.625
a total disaster.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.583
- I guess we all shouldn't have

20:52.667 --> 20:55.583
gone up there at the same time.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.291
- Once again,

20:55.625 --> 20:57.291
victims of circumstance.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.959
We tried to do something good,

20:57.333 --> 20:59.959
and something bad happened.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.959
[bang]

21:01.000 --> 21:04.542
It never ends.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.834
- It's okay.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.458
You may have ruined

21:05.875 --> 21:07.458
my tree house,

21:07.500 --> 21:10.542
but you've given me something

21:07.500 --> 21:10.542
much more valuable:

21:10.583 --> 21:12.291
your friendship.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.291
- Aw.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.291
- And I know something

21:12.333 --> 21:14.291
we friends can do together

21:14.333 --> 21:17.917
that's better than hanging

21:14.333 --> 21:17.917
in a silly old tree house.

21:17.959 --> 21:19.750
You know, I used to

21:17.959 --> 21:19.750
find this boring,

21:19.792 --> 21:23.500
but now that I'm doing it

21:19.792 --> 21:23.500
with friends, it's kind of fun.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.208
- Yeah.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.208
This is great.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.875
- So much fun.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.542
- Way better than hanging out

21:27.917 --> 21:30.542
in a tree house.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.709
- I have a splinter.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.709
- You know,

21:32.750 --> 21:34.709
I used to think

21:34.750 --> 21:36.917
you guys were just using me

21:34.750 --> 21:36.917
for my tree house,

21:36.959 --> 21:40.792
but now I can see that our

21:36.959 --> 21:40.792
friendship is built to last.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.458
- Oh, well.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.458
- I guess that's it for today.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.875
- Got to go.
