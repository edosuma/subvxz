Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:07.266 --> 01:10.603
I'm gonna
tell you a story.

01:17.176 --> 01:19.510
Not just any old story.

01:26.918 --> 01:29.021
The story is about a man.

01:34.325 --> 01:35.928
A man on a mission.

02:38.957 --> 02:41.124
A man that possesses
an alien proclivity

02:41.126 --> 02:44.227
for the complex physics
necessary to move a body

02:44.229 --> 02:48.300
in calculated and
unnatural ways through space.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.637
Ha. Just kidding.

02:53.639 --> 02:56.273
It ain't that kind of story.

02:58.310 --> 03:01.414
It's a tale of four
snowboarders.

03:02.514 --> 03:03.683
The young gun,

03:05.918 --> 03:06.920
the veteran,

03:09.288 --> 03:10.189
some chick,

03:12.191 --> 03:13.723
and this other guy.

03:13.725 --> 03:14.561
Hello.

03:19.865 --> 03:22.865
The story
starts in a place that, well,

03:22.867 --> 03:24.400
I'd be lying to you if it wasn't

03:24.402 --> 03:28.441
some straight out of what
you might call fairytale.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.840
I'm not kidding.

03:30.842 --> 03:31.944
Who am I to say?

03:33.378 --> 03:37.147
There could be thousands
of fairies in these woods.

03:37.149 --> 03:38.982
Certainly, used to be
thousands of salmon

03:38.984 --> 03:41.885
that would travel half the
continent upstrem from the Pacific

03:41.887 --> 03:44.389
just to spawn on these waters.

03:47.058 --> 03:48.324
It's a little place deep

03:48.326 --> 03:51.894
in the interior of
British Columbia.

03:51.896 --> 03:53.966
A place they call Galena.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.768
Far from civilization,

03:57.770 --> 04:01.941
but about as close to heaven
as you can get in this world.

04:03.108 --> 04:05.675
A place that during
this time of the year,

04:05.677 --> 04:09.514
and nearly always, is
shrouded in cloud and fog.

04:10.848 --> 04:14.721
Rock and earth stand snow-capped
like great cathedrals.

04:29.735 --> 04:32.902
I should tell you,
Mother Nature still rules

04:32.904 --> 04:34.806
this part of the world.

04:36.742 --> 04:41.043
And below that thick,
shrouded clouds, well,

04:41.045 --> 04:42.846
that's where she
had some of her most

04:42.848 --> 04:44.751
intricate works of art.

04:46.884 --> 04:49.721
She's quite the
Picasso, I'll say.

04:51.122 --> 04:55.027
She paints in broad,
heavy white brush strokes.

04:56.694 --> 04:59.829
And the weather had
to be just right,

04:59.831 --> 05:02.999
not too hot, not too cold,

05:03.735 --> 05:05.267
or these delicate
little snowflakes

05:05.269 --> 05:07.673
couldn't stack up just right.

05:10.408 --> 05:13.079
Well, lucky for our heroes here,

05:14.512 --> 05:17.582
this winter turned
out to be perfect.

05:18.416 --> 05:20.018
Absolutely perfect.

05:21.687 --> 05:23.790
It was a field of dreams.

05:26.992 --> 05:31.026
Which is why these fellows
called them "pillows" I suppose.

05:31.028 --> 05:34.163
Funny choice of words, I'd say,

05:34.165 --> 05:35.765
since watching them
riding down these things

05:35.767 --> 05:39.938
looked more like a bar fight
than a good night sleep.

06:56.548 --> 06:58.647
Now, it's not all
just about bar fighting

06:58.649 --> 07:01.550
down a pillow
stack around here.

07:01.552 --> 07:05.589
If a man wants to draw a lone
line through a quiet forest,

07:05.591 --> 07:07.259
by all means he can.

07:51.136 --> 07:54.738
I don't often show
folks this place,

07:54.740 --> 07:57.742
I've grown quite
weary of strangers,

07:58.911 --> 08:02.077
but I can tell by the
look on their faces

08:02.079 --> 08:03.748
they were different.

08:05.117 --> 08:08.450
I've felt drawn
to show it to 'em.

08:08.452 --> 08:10.753
And, who am I exactly?

08:10.755 --> 08:12.757
Well, we'll get to that.

08:15.192 --> 08:17.829
I've been in Galena a long time.

08:19.064 --> 08:22.835
Just think of me as the
steward of this land.

08:24.536 --> 08:27.904
And if you listen close enough,

08:27.906 --> 08:30.740
you, like them, might learn that

08:30.742 --> 08:34.913
there's a lot more going
on here than meets the eye.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.455
Now, before I head down the road

09:19.457 --> 09:23.562
of this long and endless
story, and I assure you,

09:24.562 --> 09:27.066
it is the most endless of roads,

09:28.265 --> 09:30.367
I should tell you how
these folks came to be

09:30.369 --> 09:32.768
in this part of the world,

09:32.770 --> 09:35.905
for it wasn't by some
random act of chance.

09:35.907 --> 09:39.512
No, it was most definitely
an act of faith.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.814
Nine, nine, nine!

09:44.816 --> 09:46.749
Austen Sweetin.

09:46.751 --> 09:50.619
Friends call him "Sweet
Tea", "Sweet and Low".

09:50.621 --> 09:52.390
Fire monkey of a kid.

09:53.258 --> 09:55.360
In the good year of 1999,

09:57.361 --> 10:01.498
on this particular day, his
life would change forever.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.599
Are you kidding me?

10:03.601 --> 10:05.001
In "The
Birdman's" precisely

10:05.003 --> 10:07.170
two and a half rotations,

10:07.172 --> 10:09.973
Austen saw a glimpse of
his own true potential.

10:09.975 --> 10:12.175
This is the best
day of my life.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.847
His infatuation
with skateboarding grew

10:17.849 --> 10:20.650
until it could no longer
be contained withinin the limits

10:20.652 --> 10:22.786
of the concrete jungle.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.457
So he turned his sights upwards.

10:29.494 --> 10:31.994
Bryan Fox. Like
most San Diegans,

10:31.996 --> 10:34.631
he grew up with an afinity
for punk-rock music

10:34.633 --> 10:36.733
and the Pacific Ocean.

10:36.735 --> 10:39.736
By the young age of six he had
become the Anthony Bourdain

10:39.738 --> 10:41.240
of local burritos.

10:42.841 --> 10:44.741
By the age of nine
he'd mastered the art

10:44.743 --> 10:47.643
of drawing a perfect
barreling wave.

10:47.645 --> 10:51.817
A right of passage and a skill
he still maintains today.

10:55.153 --> 10:58.324
And then there's
Robin. Robin Van Gyn.

10:59.725 --> 11:03.526
Kind of like the female version
of Jean Claude Van Damme.

11:03.528 --> 11:05.728
She takes the meaning of
all-natural to a level

11:05.730 --> 11:09.498
only countered by the
original hunter-gatherers.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.501
While her female
counterparts elsewhere

11:11.503 --> 11:13.268
bragged about how
much green juice

11:13.270 --> 11:15.438
they bought from
the farmer's market,

11:15.440 --> 11:18.610
well, Robin was out
here making her own.

11:22.614 --> 11:25.147
Robin's the kind of girl
that folks in Los Angeles

11:25.149 --> 11:27.916
name their boutique shops after,

11:27.918 --> 11:32.021
like yarn and cider,
or lace and log.

11:32.023 --> 11:35.695
And, yet, she absolutely
cuts her own logs.

11:37.796 --> 11:40.729
You ever heard of a
guy named Travis Rice?

11:42.701 --> 11:47.002
A fella whose stories are
that of fable and lore.

11:47.004 --> 11:51.110
Fire in his eyes and
dragon stone for balls.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.076
Myth has it he surfed
a flaming asteroid

11:54.078 --> 11:58.183
across the Milky Way just
to land on this planet.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.120
And, yeah, he's stomping.

12:03.788 --> 12:04.622
Howdy.

12:06.323 --> 12:09.124
But, what about
the sensitive side of Travis?

12:09.126 --> 12:11.627
Do you ever think about that?

12:11.629 --> 12:13.329
Sure he has one.

12:13.331 --> 12:15.330
Even the toughest
dragons have soft spots

12:15.332 --> 12:18.066
on their tender,
little underbellies.

12:18.068 --> 12:20.703
Never before has man
lived so entranced

12:20.705 --> 12:23.642
by the microscopic
details of life.

12:26.076 --> 12:29.912
A long, slow stretch
with no pants on.

12:29.914 --> 12:34.086
Soft, luxurious feel of an
exquisitely tailored house coat.

12:34.686 --> 12:36.388
I mean, kimono.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.454
The subtle perfection
of a simple meal

12:39.456 --> 12:43.195
shares in harmonious
silence with loved ones.

12:44.629 --> 12:47.463
It's the little things in
life that fill his soul,

12:47.465 --> 12:50.233
like watching a glorious
sunset while a warm breeze

12:50.235 --> 12:52.401
blows through his
fabulous flowing hair

12:52.403 --> 12:54.240
like a playful kitten.

12:55.639 --> 12:59.812
Hell, his reverence for the
mysteries of nature run so deep

13:00.912 --> 13:03.246
even animals are
tamed in his presence.

13:03.248 --> 13:07.353
Ernie, you're the only
one that understands me.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.458
Our friends here
were embarking on a journey

13:15.460 --> 13:17.530
into the thralls of winter.

13:19.096 --> 13:21.933
And what a winter
it was becoming.

13:41.552 --> 13:43.085
It's deep.

13:43.087 --> 13:45.454
I'm only five foot three, but,

13:45.456 --> 13:48.958
shit, it's three and a
half feet, bottomless.

14:13.951 --> 14:16.151
Finishing my
calculus equations,

14:16.153 --> 14:19.692
I think the formula is
gonna prove correct.

17:47.765 --> 17:50.499
See these snowflakes?

17:50.501 --> 17:52.503
Beautiful little things.

17:54.506 --> 17:57.743
But, where do you
think they come from?

17:59.911 --> 18:02.678
I bet your answer is clouds.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.682
Hah. Clouds.

18:05.115 --> 18:07.415
Now, I'm not gonna lecture you,

18:07.417 --> 18:10.585
but it's a bit more
than just clouds.

18:10.587 --> 18:13.922
You see, there is a thin
vale air stiring above us

18:13.924 --> 18:17.392
like the vast currents
of the Pacific.

18:17.394 --> 18:19.895
The great aerial ocean.

18:19.897 --> 18:23.834
And Galena is situated
quite perfectly beneath it.

18:35.346 --> 18:38.480
This season, the great ocean
delivered the perfect mixture

18:38.482 --> 18:42.653
to provide months of snowfall
of the highest consistency.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.758
This constant
sprinkling happens to be

18:49.760 --> 18:51.861
the perfect ingredient
for one of nature's

18:51.863 --> 18:53.632
rare snow formations:

18:54.965 --> 18:56.134
fluted spine.

19:00.637 --> 19:03.474
When the sun finally
does come out

19:04.741 --> 19:07.512
they're quite the
sight to look at.

19:42.145 --> 19:46.317
Hey, Travis, I
think we have storm coming.

19:47.184 --> 19:49.554
Well, hallelujah.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.632
Nestled amongst the
great forest

20:37.634 --> 20:41.136
and handcrafted from a
few fallen cedar trees,

20:41.138 --> 20:43.741
lay the tiniest of tiny cabins.

20:45.209 --> 20:49.014
Here, Austen, Robin and their
not-so-tiny Labrador, Stella,

20:50.448 --> 20:53.516
had decided to hunker down
and wait out the storm.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.651
Austen, I think
we need some more wood.

20:55.653 --> 20:58.086
More wood?
I got some tiny logs.

20:58.088 --> 21:00.189
Great!

21:00.191 --> 21:02.591
Bein' it
was such a tiny cabin

21:02.593 --> 21:04.759
the two became accustomed
to tiny things.

21:04.761 --> 21:05.596
Too big.

21:07.065 --> 21:08.797
Each piece
of tiny kindling could be

21:08.799 --> 21:11.199
no longer than two inches,

21:11.201 --> 21:13.201
but this story takes
place in Canada,

21:13.203 --> 21:16.774
so that is precisely
5.08 tiny centimeters.

21:18.276 --> 21:21.509
And once the room
was nice and hot,

21:21.511 --> 21:23.813
well, they played
tiny little jams.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.948
♪ Tiny house man in
a tiny house land

21:25.950 --> 21:30.122
♪ That played his amplifier
in a tiny house band

21:31.489 --> 21:32.755
♪ I was playing my
guitar but it was too big

21:32.757 --> 21:36.928
♪ So I got a tiny
one, that's how I live

21:38.363 --> 21:39.628
Every morning
Austen would prepare coffee

21:39.630 --> 21:41.497
in the tiny cabin.

21:41.499 --> 21:44.333
This daily regimen
required the following:

21:44.335 --> 21:46.469
two miniature silver spoons,

21:46.471 --> 21:49.404
two mugs with the gross
capacity of two ounces,

21:49.406 --> 21:51.239
and a tiny jar of
milk that was sourced

21:51.241 --> 21:54.075
from dwarf cows in Nova Scotia.

21:54.077 --> 21:58.080
And, of course, the
beans, tiny beans of joy.

21:58.082 --> 21:59.715
And Austen was
incredibly particular

21:59.717 --> 22:02.117
about these little beans.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.362
When the
coffee was finally done

22:13.364 --> 22:15.933
the two toasted to good tiding,

22:17.268 --> 22:21.306
for they knew that,
eventually, storm would clear.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.609
And outside that
cabin was a world

22:26.611 --> 22:28.576
that was anything but tiny.

22:28.578 --> 22:29.847
Come on, sun!

22:31.449 --> 22:32.284
Shine!

22:33.417 --> 22:34.418
We need you!

22:35.853 --> 22:36.855
We want you!

22:37.989 --> 22:40.325
Damn, you! Don't raise down!

22:44.961 --> 22:45.763
Hallelujah!

24:02.038 --> 24:03.873
Fucking big tank.

24:03.875 --> 24:04.709
Big tank!

26:54.545 --> 26:57.779
The unique
terrain draws people here.

26:57.781 --> 27:00.117
There's no doubt about that.

27:01.618 --> 27:05.789
But it's the timber that's
attracted most of the attention,

27:07.223 --> 27:10.191
'cause these aren't your
regular strands of trees.

27:10.193 --> 27:13.464
Nothing better than
a walk in nature.

27:16.166 --> 27:19.169
These trees are over
1,000 years old.

27:20.438 --> 27:23.708
And that's school,
politic and counted.

27:25.476 --> 27:27.412
They counted the rings.

27:28.445 --> 27:30.014
The beauty of that.

27:31.147 --> 27:34.149
How can you just
not fucking love it?

27:34.151 --> 27:37.055
Look at that cedar
tree. A monster.

27:40.156 --> 27:41.326
God's country.

27:43.027 --> 27:45.630
Nothing better, nothing bigger.

27:46.963 --> 27:49.597
God's
country, perhaps.

27:49.599 --> 27:52.603
Undisturbed by
glacier, wildfire or man,

27:54.305 --> 27:57.840
these forests stand
as time capsules.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.009
The old grove.

28:03.012 --> 28:07.184
But, you see, there's old
and then there's ancient.

28:09.319 --> 28:12.254
Up the head waters of
the Incomappleux River

28:12.256 --> 28:15.289
lies a particular growth
I'd like to tell you about.

28:22.900 --> 28:26.434
Down from the alpine to
the bio-geo-climatic zones

28:26.436 --> 28:30.305
of the vertically
integrated ecosystem

28:30.307 --> 28:34.479
lay one of the last ancient
forests in all of Galena.

28:39.115 --> 28:43.288
Better said, one of the best
tree runs of these riders' lives.

29:17.086 --> 29:20.154
It's hard not to love a forest,

29:20.156 --> 29:23.091
but a forest as grand as this,

29:23.093 --> 29:27.265
well, that's a whole
other kind of love story.

29:33.369 --> 29:34.972
Western red cedars,

29:35.772 --> 29:40.611
that's what makes up most
of this ancient forest.

29:41.478 --> 29:43.879
Some grow as old as 2,000 years

29:43.881 --> 29:46.849
and measure 35 feet round.

30:04.934 --> 30:07.004
Some big fucking trees.

30:08.372 --> 30:10.072
Beneath
these antiquated canopies

30:10.074 --> 30:12.274
thrives a metropolis.

30:18.214 --> 30:19.981
Everyone knows
there's a root system

30:19.983 --> 30:23.352
that anchors these
trees in place.

30:23.354 --> 30:27.322
What if I told you there's
communication here?

30:27.324 --> 30:30.691
I'd even go as far to
call it intelligence.

30:30.693 --> 30:31.959
The oldest of these giants

30:31.961 --> 30:34.896
passing on what they
know to their young.

30:34.898 --> 30:39.069
Save garden knowledge and
wisdom to keep a forest alive.

30:39.803 --> 30:41.472
Yes, these trees talk.

30:48.112 --> 30:52.550
Behold, the nervous
system of the valley.

31:00.156 --> 31:00.991
Oh!

31:06.630 --> 31:07.532
Whoa! Yeah!

31:09.799 --> 31:11.565
Watch out for the
dead spike in there.

31:11.567 --> 31:13.168
Oh, gosh!

31:13.170 --> 31:14.736
Oh, my goodness. It's crazy.

31:14.738 --> 31:15.573
Oh!

31:16.906 --> 31:19.440
Crazy people.

31:19.442 --> 31:23.711
Nobody has any respect for
their body. It's a temple.

31:23.713 --> 31:25.515
Your body is a temple.

31:49.772 --> 31:52.173
So, it's very nice.

32:04.887 --> 32:09.059
As long as I could see 10
feet from me, victory.

32:26.477 --> 32:27.644
Travis Rice.

32:29.145 --> 32:32.748
Probably doing
something questionable.

32:57.807 --> 33:01.645
A-grade high-quality
H2O powder.

34:16.119 --> 34:16.953
Ha!

34:33.835 --> 34:34.672
Whooo!

34:37.007 --> 34:37.842
Yeah!

35:21.083 --> 35:22.550
Every
once in a while,

35:22.552 --> 35:26.223
man comes along as well
just a little bit different.

35:27.356 --> 35:28.590
I'm talking about the
kind of difference

35:28.592 --> 35:31.126
that makes a man hike
alone to the woods

35:31.128 --> 35:35.199
with a 183-centimeter pink
snowboard on his back.

35:38.235 --> 35:41.336
Bryan fondly named his
companion "Big Pink",

35:41.338 --> 35:44.505
on the account of her
sheer girth and prowess.

35:44.507 --> 35:47.275
It towers above the rest of
Bryan's well-manicured quiver

35:47.277 --> 35:50.681
like a champion Clydesdale among
its tall opponents.

35:52.382 --> 35:55.249
And with a trusty
see like "Big Pink"

35:55.251 --> 35:59.186
Bryan felt compelled to explore
the mysteries of Galena.

35:59.188 --> 36:01.722
Seems he had an unquenchable
desire to seek out

36:01.724 --> 36:05.327
only the finest
geothermal heated waters,

36:05.329 --> 36:07.595
hot springs, for the lay man.

36:07.597 --> 36:08.996
Temperature of these
springs must be

36:08.998 --> 36:11.967
exactly 101 degrees Fahrenheit,

36:11.969 --> 36:14.802
with the Ph balance of 7.55,

36:14.804 --> 36:17.771
and at least 1,000 parts per
million of dissolved minerals

36:17.773 --> 36:20.610
such as calcium,
iron and lithium.

36:26.315 --> 36:28.215
But Bryan infatuation
with hot springs

36:28.217 --> 36:31.619
is nothing compared
to his real obsession.

36:31.621 --> 36:34.990
Over his lifetime Bryan claims
he's successfully summited

36:34.992 --> 36:38.496
over 400 mountains
peaks around the world.

36:39.896 --> 36:41.231
421 to be exact.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.702
Most of non-notable status.

37:49.932 --> 37:51.865
That was...

37:51.867 --> 37:52.702
Whoa.

37:57.306 --> 37:58.575
Can you see it?

38:01.478 --> 38:03.545
That was a lot deeper
than I thought.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.847
It's a long way
down from that top.

38:05.849 --> 38:06.684
Yeah.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.121
Some humans
seem like they are born

38:14.123 --> 38:16.057
with a deep desire
to understand the

38:16.059 --> 38:18.162
natural world around 'em.

38:19.329 --> 38:21.229
And, in a place like this,

38:21.231 --> 38:24.135
there's a lot going on that
needs to be understood.

38:25.135 --> 38:27.135
Hi, my name is John Buffery.

38:27.137 --> 38:28.769
You can call me "Buff".

38:28.771 --> 38:31.039
And I'm snowboard guide.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.941
Actually,
he's much more

38:32.943 --> 38:35.075
than just the snowboard guide.

38:35.077 --> 38:36.945
When it comes to the
art of snow evaluation

38:36.947 --> 38:40.815
and risk assessment, he's
a verified snow Yoda.

38:40.817 --> 38:43.385
Over the past three decades
he's lead guiding missions

38:43.387 --> 38:45.653
all over the planet.

38:45.655 --> 38:47.956
He's even been shot at.

38:47.958 --> 38:49.356
One time on a bad country trip

38:49.358 --> 38:51.793
near the Shah's mountain palace

38:51.795 --> 38:56.097
the Iranian Royal Guard
mistook him for a spy.

38:56.099 --> 38:58.032
What are you looking
for there, Buff?

38:58.034 --> 39:00.467
Instability in the layers?

39:00.469 --> 39:03.537
Yep. That's
absolutely correct.

39:03.539 --> 39:07.711
Behold what a
master carries in his pack.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.313
Part of the job
of the snow jedis

39:13.315 --> 39:16.383
is to assess the
safety of the snowpack,

39:16.385 --> 39:18.619
and he's got quite
the magic touch.

39:18.621 --> 39:20.354
Hey, Buff, it's
Travis.

39:20.356 --> 39:22.692
Go ahead, this is Buff,
Travis.

39:30.766 --> 39:32.166
I'm in a really
good spot response,

39:32.168 --> 39:34.235
and I like what I'm seeing.

39:34.237 --> 39:35.903
When
Buff's not guiding

39:35.905 --> 39:38.539
he's in his office at
the Ministry of Transport

39:38.541 --> 39:40.675
using his snow sensei
brain to mitigate

39:40.677 --> 39:44.278
avalanche dangers on the
Trans-Canada Highway.

39:44.280 --> 39:48.451
And, yes, he still has his
first avalanche beacon.

39:49.786 --> 39:52.487
Buff has over 200
notebooks of field notes.

39:52.489 --> 39:56.057
Decades of detailed observations
about weather conditions,

39:56.059 --> 39:58.626
base camp logistics,
temperature,

39:58.628 --> 40:01.865
and snowpacks ability
fill their pages.

40:03.599 --> 40:07.001
"Why is all this
important", you ask?

40:07.003 --> 40:10.537
Well, you see, only
with time and experience

40:10.539 --> 40:12.373
does one learn how
to read the mountains

40:12.375 --> 40:14.545
the way John Buffery does.

40:18.748 --> 40:21.918
And everyone can
use a good shepherd,

40:23.920 --> 40:25.186
especially around these parts.

40:37.166 --> 40:38.735
These are cornices.

40:40.170 --> 40:42.336
By wind-driven snow they
form into school bus-sized

40:42.338 --> 40:46.007
doomsday devices that
can be hair triggered.

40:53.516 --> 40:55.983
Surprisingly, cornices
and avalanches

40:55.985 --> 40:58.952
aren't the deadliest
hazards out here.

40:58.954 --> 41:00.621
In fact, it's the tree wells

41:00.623 --> 41:02.956
you should be most
concerned about.

41:02.958 --> 41:05.159
Usually one can't get out alone,

41:05.161 --> 41:08.896
and that's why the buddy system
is always in place out here.

41:08.898 --> 41:10.597
Take a look at these buddies,

41:10.599 --> 41:14.771
sword fighting down the
mountain like a bunch of idiots.

41:15.972 --> 41:19.574
Complete disregard
of their own safety.

41:19.576 --> 41:22.309
However, if you find
yourself trapped

41:22.311 --> 41:25.280
in the mountains for the night.

41:28.952 --> 41:31.653
The tree well can become
a life saving shelter.

41:31.655 --> 41:32.887
Tea?

41:32.889 --> 41:33.791
Oh, yeah.

41:40.996 --> 41:44.632
I think around the wide is
probably the hottest spot.

41:44.634 --> 41:48.706
The top slope is gonna
be gone into the chutes,

41:49.706 --> 41:51.338
so you're not gonna
have to worry about it.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.974
If you have to stop let
the snow go through it,

41:53.976 --> 41:55.144
don't go fast.

41:56.646 --> 41:59.947
Do you think that's 3,000
T to V, top to valley?

41:59.949 --> 42:01.351
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

42:02.952 --> 42:06.720
It's all quite within
your realms of management.

42:06.722 --> 42:08.389
Alright, man. Feels
like you're best in here,

42:08.391 --> 42:10.691
- and look at it any longer.
- Yeah.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.481
Get ready.

42:32.983 --> 42:34.051
We are ready.

43:11.788 --> 43:13.487
And I feel
pretty good to continue.

43:13.489 --> 43:17.627
Be on ridge, just
watch the transitioning.

44:55.525 --> 44:59.697
I've always had
a fondness for these giants.

45:00.864 --> 45:05.166
I'm talking about
the land, of course.

45:05.168 --> 45:07.171
By land I mean all this.

45:10.072 --> 45:14.175
Galena holds quite the
collection, I'd say.

45:14.177 --> 45:16.677
Not many things you can
fear and be in reverence of,

45:16.679 --> 45:18.382
all at the same time.

45:19.849 --> 45:23.383
It took quite some years for
this place to look this way.

45:23.385 --> 45:25.452
It's all being washed
over by Mother's

45:25.454 --> 45:28.458
great saline quilt
at one point.

45:29.592 --> 45:33.030
Still changing, too,
right before your eyes.

45:35.364 --> 45:36.766
You can't see it,

45:37.900 --> 45:39.800
this is just a
snapshot of a painting

45:39.802 --> 45:41.971
that's a work in progress, if
you will.

45:44.340 --> 45:46.340
Because the perception
of time is different

45:46.342 --> 45:49.376
for everything on this planet,

45:49.378 --> 45:52.947
I'm trying to explain to
you the concept of time.

45:52.949 --> 45:57.121
Hell, that's a rabbit hole,
if I've ever seen one.

45:59.054 --> 46:01.454
One thing is for certain,

46:01.456 --> 46:05.626
current state of this
painting, this land,

46:05.628 --> 46:07.662
is about as full of
abstracts and oddities

46:07.664 --> 46:09.399
as one could imagine.

46:15.938 --> 46:19.442
And our friends sure do
love those oddities.

46:21.610 --> 46:23.946
Take this arch, for example.

46:25.380 --> 46:29.353
Right conditions of wind, rain
and soft-pocketed limestone

46:30.753 --> 46:34.889
and these guys just
about lost their shit.

46:34.891 --> 46:39.061
They were so excited it'd
never been ridden before

46:40.128 --> 46:41.929
they rode it together
like brothers.

46:41.931 --> 46:44.333
Let's have some fun, buddy.

47:05.487 --> 47:09.490
They
named it "Tunnel buddy",

47:09.492 --> 47:11.894
whatever the hell that means.

47:14.097 --> 47:17.334
It's said that every
line has it's day.

47:18.701 --> 47:21.101
Hey, guys.
Dropping ahead, 10 seconds.

47:21.103 --> 47:22.570
The thing is,

47:22.572 --> 47:26.677
when you speak about the
truly bizarre, the rarities,

47:27.844 --> 47:31.945
that day can be a
decade apart sometimes.

47:31.947 --> 47:35.115
It comes down to right
time, right place, I'll say.

47:35.117 --> 47:37.286
Okay. Dropping.

49:19.856 --> 49:20.691
Holy shit!

49:22.625 --> 49:24.791
Alright. That was fun.

49:24.793 --> 49:26.128
Whoa!

49:30.632 --> 49:32.368
That was so savage.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.309
I've lived
here my entire life,

49:42.311 --> 49:44.845
and I've seen everything.

49:44.847 --> 49:47.851
And, see, we all
talk to each other.

49:49.684 --> 49:51.318
That's what makes
you so different

49:51.320 --> 49:55.492
than any other plant or
animal on this planet.

49:56.358 --> 49:58.492
We know our purpose here.

49:58.494 --> 50:00.226
You probably wouldn't
believe me if I said

50:00.228 --> 50:02.898
I had everything to do with you.

50:06.168 --> 50:08.672
Since I've got your attention,

50:09.838 --> 50:11.438
I might as well tell you

50:11.440 --> 50:15.011
how I came to be in
this part of the world.

50:16.978 --> 50:20.447
I was born in the
time of King Arthur.

50:20.449 --> 50:24.620
Fought for life as a seedling
while the Roman Empire fell.

50:26.822 --> 50:28.789
I grew from a
sapling into a tree

50:28.791 --> 50:32.963
as men sailed west in the
searched of the undiscovered.

50:34.163 --> 50:37.000
Irony is, there are
already people here.

50:38.166 --> 50:41.001
Had been for many millennia.

50:41.003 --> 50:42.838
It was different then.

50:43.905 --> 50:49.376
They had a deep
connection to this land.

50:49.378 --> 50:51.811
I had a family around
me that protected me

50:51.813 --> 50:55.418
from avalanches
and tumbling rocks.

50:59.054 --> 51:02.058
I was all that was left of them.

51:02.492 --> 51:06.663
Here I stood while man built
cities and great things.

51:08.431 --> 51:12.034
Oh, what wondrous things
you people create.

51:13.101 --> 51:15.001
As men step down on the moon

51:15.003 --> 51:16.336
I looked upward from here

51:16.338 --> 51:18.938
and smiled of being
a part of it all.

51:18.940 --> 51:21.944
Which brings me to
this moment here,

51:24.780 --> 51:27.551
where my world
and yours collide.

51:33.789 --> 51:36.389
What a chance encounter.

51:36.391 --> 51:38.492
It's not often enough that
one of you take the time

51:38.494 --> 51:40.730
to talk to one of us trees.

51:43.900 --> 51:47.066
The day will come when
I return to the soil

51:47.068 --> 51:49.172
and start all over again.

51:50.806 --> 51:52.907
It was my honor to give
you all a little window

51:52.909 --> 51:56.043
into what I've
seen in this life.

52:26.675 --> 52:28.777
I give you all the 900.

56:24.914 --> 56:29.085
And I said that
this story was an endless road,

56:29.952 --> 56:31.488
and still assure you it is,

56:32.487 --> 56:35.090
but before you leave this place

56:36.625 --> 56:38.758
I'll share with you a secret.

56:47.268 --> 56:48.735
Funny thing is.

56:51.773 --> 56:53.407
You probably already know it.

57:03.952 --> 57:08.123
You see, there is magic
that exists all around you.

57:10.793 --> 57:14.927
Stand still and take it
in, like a child would.

57:17.867 --> 57:21.104
Try to see past what
you've been taught.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.470
For I'm not really a tree.

57:27.076 --> 57:28.876
Even though that's
what you call me.

57:33.382 --> 57:34.550
I just am.

57:36.719 --> 57:39.322
That's closer to how we see it.

57:40.322 --> 57:42.724
And if you search long enough

57:45.327 --> 57:48.762
you might just find
one of those fairies.

57:51.333 --> 57:52.168
Ah!
