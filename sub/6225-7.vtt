00:01.835 --> 00:05.256
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.339 --> 00:10.428
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.264
His name, Merlin.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.309
(CHANTING)

01:27.004 --> 01:29.382
(PANTING) Did you see it?
The smoke? Did you see it?

01:30.508 --> 01:31.634
No, I saw nothing.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.344
Are you blind?
You were right here!

01:34.011 --> 01:37.265
It was magic I tell you!
There's sorcery here!

01:38.349 --> 01:39.850
We must tell the king!

01:40.476 --> 01:41.644
No, wait!

02:18.055 --> 02:20.057
It was sorcery you saw,
you're certain of it?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.309
Yes, Sire.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.436
And you swear this
before your king?

02:23.978 --> 02:25.062
CATHRYN: I swear it.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.897
ARTHUR: Perhaps your eyes
deceived you.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.065
A trick of the light.

02:28.232 --> 02:30.860
CATHRYN:
The smoke was alive, I tell you.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.236
| feared for my life.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.281
UTHER: I thank you
for bringing this to my attention.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.199
Your loyalty will
not go un-rewarded.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.243
Thank you, Sire.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.623
It cannot continue.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.959
| will hunt down
those responsible, father.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.794
| promise they
will not escape unpunished.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.087
No.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.299
Stronger methods
are called for.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.177
Send for the witchfinder.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.137
(COURT GASPING)

02:58.763 --> 03:01.557
Sire, is it necessary
to resort to such measures?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.768
The witchfinder
is a trusted ally, Gaius.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.271
His help will be invaluable.

03:08.814 --> 03:09.940
Of course.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.527
How many times, Merlin?

03:13.611 --> 03:16.864
How many times must I drive it
into that thick skull of yours

03:16.947 --> 03:20.159
that your magic is a secret
to be guarded with your life.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.786
What were you thinking?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.080
(SIGHS) I wasn't thinking.

03:24.163 --> 03:26.248
Well think, boy, think!

03:26.499 --> 03:27.792
It was just a bit of fun.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.960
It was magic and it was seen.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.754
You're right, I'm sorry.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.089
You must hide the book.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.800
Anything that can connect you
to sorcery in any way.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.181
-What, now?
-Yes, now, Merlin.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.934
The man that
Uther has sent for, I know him.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.060
The witchfinder?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.937
Some know him by that name.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.980
| know him as Aredian.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.525
He is a force to
be reckoned with.

03:52.817 --> 03:54.110
But I'm not a witch.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.362
Look, no dress or anything.
(LAUGHS)

03:59.657 --> 04:00.658
I'll get the book.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.581
(HORSES NEIGHING)

04:42.867 --> 04:44.368
| am expected.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.371
Is that him?

04:48.205 --> 04:49.290
Yes.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.208
What's that cage for?

04:52.877 --> 04:54.462
It hardly bears
thinking about.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.550
(GASPS)

05:01.302 --> 05:02.595
ARTHUR: So where's he
been all this time?

05:02.678 --> 05:04.138
In foreign lands.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.265
Wherever the pursuit
of sorcery takes him.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.100
He does all this in your name?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.227
The witchfinder serves no one.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.104
He is a law unto himself.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.898
AREDIAN: Do you smell it?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.779
Do you smell it, Uther?

05:21.280 --> 05:22.323
Aredian.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.409
It's all around us.
The foul stench of sorcery.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.246
It's infected your great city
like a contagion.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.333
| welcome you
to Camelot, Aredian.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.752
Thank you, for making
such haste to be here.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.254
Well let's hope I am
not too late, hmm?

05:38.172 --> 05:41.008
For every hour counts
in the war against sorcery.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.179
Unchecked,
it spreads like a disease.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.765
Seeks out
the young and the old,

05:48.933 --> 05:50.476
the weak and the able,

05:51.310 --> 05:55.105
the fair and the foul
of heart alike.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.149
You've grown lazy, Uther.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.902
You've grown idle.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.656
Your once noble Camelot
is rotten to the core.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.118
You stand on the brink
of dark oblivion.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.666
ARTHUR:
| am at your disposal, Aredian.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.793
The knights will aid you
in any way they can.

06:16.669 --> 06:18.128
You must be Arthur?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.130
| must be.

06:20.965 --> 06:22.550
You're a great warrior.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.386
The finest this kingdom
has ever known.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.180
-Thank you...
-So you won't be offended when I say

06:28.305 --> 06:29.974
that I shall have
no need of you,

06:30.057 --> 06:31.475
or your knights.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.228
The subtle craft of sorcery
can only be fought

06:34.311 --> 06:36.063
by yet subtler means.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.441
Methods honed
over decades of study.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.986
Methods known only to myself.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.862
We are grateful for your help.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.991
Gratitude alone
can't keep a man alive,

06:47.491 --> 06:49.368
you must put
food in his belly.

06:49.493 --> 06:52.162
| will pay your price,
Aredian, whatever it may be.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.625
| will bid you good night.

06:56.709 --> 06:57.835
Aredian?

06:59.211 --> 07:00.671
When do you begin?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.090
| have already begun.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.015
Gaius, isn't it?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.559
| never forget a face.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.353
Nor |, Aredian.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.356
A physician now, I hear?

07:20.232 --> 07:22.401
You always did have
a thirst for knowledge.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.279
-Scientific knowledge.
-Of course.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.534
My assistant, Merlin.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.077
Merlin.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.039
May your investigation
prove fruitful, Aredian.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.958
However, you'll have to excuse us,
we have work to do.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.919
Naturally. Merlin.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.092
| have a few questions
| would like you to answer.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.053
Please be at my chambers
in an hour.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.905
You are aware then,

08:08.447 --> 08:12.159
that sorcery has been practiced
in the vicinity of Camelot?

08:12.618 --> 08:15.663
Yes. I mean, apparently.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.999
No, it cannot be denied.
There was a witness.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.001
Yes, I know.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.296
Do you also know that the
woman has named you as a witness?

08:24.421 --> 08:25.422
(STAMMERS) But...

08:28.300 --> 08:29.760
(EXHALES FORCEFULLY)

08:30.094 --> 08:32.388
I've already spoken to her.
She was quite clear on the matter.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.931
<i>But I wasn't a witness.</i>

08:34.682 --> 08:36.475
Sorry, perhaps I misheard.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.436
Do you deny that you were present
at the time of the incident?

08:39.520 --> 08:40.562
No, I was there.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.730
So you saw it?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.524
The horse
conjured from the smoke?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.275
| saw the smoke.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.611
But it was only smoke.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.073
| saw nothing else.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.282
You saying that she lies?

08:52.533 --> 08:55.327
| didn't say that.
| said I didn't see what she saw.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.997
Hmm. How can that be I wonder?

08:59.123 --> 09:02.042
How can one
person see something and the other not?

09:03.794 --> 09:05.170
| can't explain it.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.382
Oh. I am at a loss as
to explain it myself.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.008
(CHUCKLES)

09:12.553 --> 09:14.805
Unless it was you
who performed the magic.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.433
It wasn't.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.143
Can you prove that it wasn't?

09:25.649 --> 09:26.734
No.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.652
Hmm.

09:33.157 --> 09:34.658
That'll be all

09:43.333 --> 09:44.626
for now.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.183
Speak. Do not be afraid.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.897
| was drawing water
from the well, Sire,

10:06.148 --> 10:07.691
when I saw them.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.571
Faces, in the water, Sire.
Terrible faces.

10:13.238 --> 10:17.534
Like people who were drowned,
screaming.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.745
(CRYING) Screaming.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.163
Hmm.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.584
| haven't done anything.
| promise.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.377
Tell them what you saw.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.881
A goblin dancing on the coals.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.342
It was dancing in the flames.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.220
And it spoke, Sire.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.555
My heart near
stopped for fear of it.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.560
As you've heard, my lord,
the incident in the woods

10:43.685 --> 10:45.270
was only the beginning.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.858
There was a sorcerer, Sire,
in the square.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.737
There were creatures
jumping right out of his mouth.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.906
What manner of creature?

10:57.074 --> 10:59.576
Toads, Sire.

11:00.536 --> 11:04.289
Great, green, slimy things
as big as your fist!

11:04.540 --> 11:06.750
AREDIAN: The sorcerer
laughs in your face.

11:07.251 --> 11:10.921
Even now magic flourishes
on the streets of Camelot.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.339
| scarcely believe it.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.424
Yet it is the truth, my Lord.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.386
Fortunately, I have utilized
every facet of my craft

11:17.469 --> 11:19.763
to bring this matter
to a swift resolution.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.267
The sorcerer.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.478
-You have a suspect?
- I do, my Lord.

11:27.229 --> 11:30.607
And I regret to say
they stand among us in this very room.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.653
(GASPS)

11:34.778 --> 11:36.738
AREDIAN:
My methods are infallible,

11:36.822 --> 11:39.408
my findings incontestable.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.956
The facts point to one person
and one person alone.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.003
The boy, Merlin.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.675
Merlin?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.721
You can't be serious!

12:00.804 --> 12:03.015
This is outrageous!
You have no evidence!

12:03.140 --> 12:05.601
The tools of magic
cannot be hidden from me.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.604
I'm certain that a thorough search
of the boy's chamber,

12:08.687 --> 12:10.522
will deliver us all we need.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.610
Merlin?

12:17.279 --> 12:19.031
| have nothing
to hide from him.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.992
Very well.
Guards, restrain the boy.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.453
Let the search begin.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.463
Careful, please!
That's my life's work!

12:36.048 --> 12:37.257
Comb every inch.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.676
The sorcerer is
a master of concealment.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.012
There's nothing here, Aredian.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.181
I'll be the judge of that.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.851
Over there,
behind this tapestry.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.687
And there, upend that stool.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.731
Be sure to check
for hollow legs.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.901
And there,
within those powder jars.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.240
Here!

13:08.246 --> 13:10.374
An amulet of enchantment.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.835
Were you aware, physician,

13:14.378 --> 13:17.214
that your assistant
kept instruments of sorcery?

13:20.008 --> 13:21.051
No.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.387
Well, our work is done.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.264
| must inform the king.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.394
Aredian!

13:31.687 --> 13:34.272
| know for certain
that that amulet

13:34.398 --> 13:36.274
does not belong to Merlin.

13:37.192 --> 13:40.404
Oh,
well who does it belong to, then?

13:44.533 --> 13:45.701
It belongs to me.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.751
You're free to go.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.093
MERLIN: Gaius!
What's going on?

14:03.218 --> 14:06.263
Say nothing, Merlin.
Do nothing. Promise me!

14:31.830 --> 14:33.623
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

14:37.252 --> 14:40.130
UTHER: Gaius served me
with unfailing dedication.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.050
Without his knowledge,
his wisdom,

14:43.133 --> 14:45.052
| would not be
sitting here today.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.888
You show great
faith in him, Sire.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.557
(SCOFFS) Great faith, indeed,

14:51.808 --> 14:54.311
considering he was known
to practice sorcery.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.232
-Gaius?
-Mmm-hmm.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.318
You're mistaken.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.861
No, Arthur.
He speaks the truth.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.281
| am well aware of his past,

15:06.740 --> 15:09.785
but I have every reason to believe
he's turned his back on sorcery.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.746
-Until now.
-UTHER: We don't know that.

15:12.829 --> 15:17.167
This amulet you found could
just be a stupid mistake.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.503
Or maybe he has fallen back
into old habits.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.630
We must give him the benefit
of the doubt, surely?

15:22.464 --> 15:23.590
Why?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.681
Anyway, there's a sure way
to establish his guilt.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.936
| know your methods
are effective, Aredian,

15:36.853 --> 15:38.105
but Gaius is an old man,

15:38.188 --> 15:41.691
he could not withstand
such treatment.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.987
It's the only way
to rid your mind of doubt.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.333
(GAIUS COUGHING)

16:00.377 --> 16:01.545
What time is it?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.339
Time for you to confess.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.685
The amulet was
a relic from the past,

16:16.893 --> 16:17.978
a keepsake.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.397
Such artifacts are banned
on pain of death,

16:20.522 --> 16:21.648
surely you must know this?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.400
| was wrong to have kept it.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.485
| am grievously sorry for it.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.740
That's a good start.
It's an excellent start. (LAUGHS)

16:33.577 --> 16:35.162
But not nearly enough
I'm afraid.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.705
-Aredian...
-Guards?

16:45.338 --> 16:46.548
AREDIAN: Was your conscience clear

16:46.631 --> 16:49.009
when you practiced magic
in the days of The Great Purge?

16:49.092 --> 16:51.178
| haven't used magic in years.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.346
-Merlin kept instruments of sorcery.
-It belongs to me.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.348
So if someone else were to have
practiced magic?

16:55.432 --> 16:56.600
AREDIAN: If you're an enemy
of this kingdom

16:56.683 --> 16:58.768
you're an enemy of your king.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.604
GAIUS: My conscience is clear.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.358
I'd like a drink
of water, please.

17:06.276 --> 17:09.279
And you shall have one
when you've confessed.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.534
Then I shall die
of thirst, Aredian.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.898
(PANTING)

17:46.233 --> 17:49.819
What is wrong, young warlock?
You look so pale.

17:51.029 --> 17:54.115
| did a stupid thing.
A stupid, stupid thing!

17:55.575 --> 17:57.702
And now Gaius is
going to die for it.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.580
Gaius means nothing to me.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.792
But he means
a great deal to me!

18:05.502 --> 18:08.630
Very well,
tell me what has happened.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.842
(EXHALES)
A witchfinder has come.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.764
He's arrested Gaius for sorcery,
but I am the sorcerer.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.392
Yes, I suppose you are.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.229
I'm going to confess.
It's the only way to save him.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.690
Then your stupidity continues.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.068
| won't sacrifice a friend
to save myself!

18:30.151 --> 18:32.153
Bravely spoken,

18:32.237 --> 18:34.447
but Gaius is already doomed.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.451
If you confess,
the witchfinder will just burn you both.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.413
But it's my fault!
Don't you understand?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.708
All too well, young warlock,

18:44.791 --> 18:46.626
but understand this,

18:47.419 --> 18:49.254
if you were to die,

18:49.337 --> 18:53.466
you would endanger the lives
of all those that rely upon you.

18:54.134 --> 18:57.637
There must be something I can do.
There must be.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.890
Please, help me.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.225
Merlin,

19:02.934 --> 19:05.353
| see you are
distressed by this,

19:06.438 --> 19:08.398
but I cannot help you

19:09.649 --> 19:13.278
because I do not know how to.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.990
| can't just stand by

19:17.073 --> 19:19.200
and watch Gaius die.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.911
| can't.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.914
| am sorry.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.560
You're a traitor!
You're an imposter!

19:45.643 --> 19:47.812
Sorcery is your only master!

19:47.896 --> 19:49.647
| serve only my king.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.649
(SCOFFS) In what way have
you served him?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.985
You've lied to him,
you've broken his laws,

19:54.069 --> 19:55.320
you betrayed his trust.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.405
| saved his life,
I've treated his ward,

19:57.489 --> 19:58.907
I've protected his only son!

20:01.034 --> 20:02.869
You have treated his ward?

20:07.123 --> 20:09.209
| have striven to help
all those in need.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.461
It is a physician's duty
to do so.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.255
-The Lady Morgana?
-Among others.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.802
For what malady does
she receive this treatment?

20:18.927 --> 20:20.261
(STAMMERS)

20:21.971 --> 20:23.807
She suffers from nightmares.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.601
| see.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.436
But as I said,

20:28.520 --> 20:30.814
| feel it is my duty to attend
to the needs...

20:30.897 --> 20:34.526
Yes, yes. You seem very keen
to change the subject, Gaius.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.365
Perhaps I should
question her myself.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.485
There's no need not be concerned,
my Lady, I won't detain you long.

21:18.361 --> 21:22.824
There's just a small detail
| wish to clarify.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.409
(AREDIAN CHUCKLES)

21:25.493 --> 21:27.954
Now it is true, is it not,

21:28.037 --> 21:30.999
that you have
received treatment for nightmares?

21:32.584 --> 21:33.710
Hmm.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.547
And it was Gaius,
the court physician

21:37.630 --> 21:39.215
who administered
these treatments,

21:39.299 --> 21:40.842
these potions?

21:41.926 --> 21:43.052
Yes.

21:45.013 --> 21:47.307
I'm sorry, could you speak up?

21:48.516 --> 21:49.517
Yes.

21:53.730 --> 21:57.192
Thank you. Now you may go.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.027
(LAUGHS)

22:01.988 --> 22:05.283
You don't happen to know
what was in these potions, I suppose?

22:06.201 --> 22:08.745
-Oh, no.
-No, of course not.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.372
You're not a physician,
after all. (LAUGHS)

22:11.706 --> 22:13.041
(LAUGHS)

22:13.416 --> 22:16.085
(CHUCKLES)
So for all you know,

22:16.336 --> 22:17.962
these potions could
have been magical.

22:18.046 --> 22:21.549
Your dreams, the product
of an enchanted elixir?

22:23.092 --> 22:25.261
| had these dreams
before Gaius started treating me.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.847
But these dreams,
have they got better or worse

22:27.931 --> 22:29.807
since Gaius
began treating you?

22:36.648 --> 22:37.857
Worse.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.401
As I thought.

22:43.071 --> 22:46.032
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.296
AREDIAN: Gaius.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.300
Are you prepared to confess?

23:05.635 --> 23:07.220
I'd rather die first.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.348
Good, and die you shall.

23:11.391 --> 23:14.227
But, not alone I'm pleased to say.
You shall have company.

23:16.437 --> 23:17.397
What?

23:17.480 --> 23:21.317
Merlin and the Lady Morgana
are to join you in the flames.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.780
No, this is a trick.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.324
Mmm-mmm.
You've corrupted them, Gaius,

23:28.408 --> 23:30.577
and they must
answer to their king.

23:31.703 --> 23:32.996
Unless...

23:34.330 --> 23:35.582
Unless, what?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.252
AREDIAN: Confess!

23:41.379 --> 23:42.714
Confess!

23:53.474 --> 23:57.145
| am a sorcerer, Sire.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.524
| am responsible
for conjuring the smoke.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.528
I'm guilty of practicing magic
in Camelot.

24:06.487 --> 24:09.073
The goblin,
the faces in the well,

24:09.574 --> 24:11.075
I...

24:11.200 --> 24:14.787
| am the sorcerer who conjured
the toad from his mouth.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.462
You've betrayed me, Gaius.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.049
Betrayed your friends.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.303
But above all,
you have betrayed yourself.

24:33.556 --> 24:36.601
By the laws of Camelot,
| must sentence you

24:42.065 --> 24:43.274
to death.

24:44.984 --> 24:49.030
The sorcerer will be purged
of his magic by means of fire!

24:49.906 --> 24:53.117
He shall be
burned at the stake tomorrow at dawn!

24:54.160 --> 24:56.913
Bear witness and
heed this lesson!

25:04.420 --> 25:05.755
You're a liar!

25:07.006 --> 25:08.257
UTHER: Guards!

25:08.383 --> 25:10.593
-You're a liar!
-I'll deal with this.

25:19.644 --> 25:22.021
| know you're upset and angry,
it's all right.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.606
I'm not throwing you in jail.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.191
Then what are you doing?

25:27.110 --> 25:28.695
I'm breaking the law.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.490
| can only give
you a few minutes.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.451
They wouldn't let me see you.
| couldn't do anything.

25:35.535 --> 25:36.869
| understand.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.497
| can't believe it.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.249
| can't believe
Uther could do this to you.

25:41.332 --> 25:44.502
He'd no choice.
Once Aredian had found the amulet...

25:45.044 --> 25:46.796
| didn't even know
you had such a thing.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.922
It isn't mine.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.051
-Why did you say it was?
-I was trying to protect you.

25:57.682 --> 25:58.808
| don't know what to say.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.685
It's all right, Merlin.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.437
You don't have
to say anything.

26:03.271 --> 26:04.689
Yeah, I do.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.525
The amulet isn't mine, either.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.485
Then, how did it get there?

26:09.569 --> 26:10.903
-Aredian.
-Aredian?

26:10.987 --> 26:12.196
There's no other explanation.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.698
-But why?
-It doesn't matter why.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.200
All that matters is, if I can prove
he planted it, you're saved!

26:16.367 --> 26:19.162
No, you must let this go.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.831
You were falsely accused.
| have a chance to prove that.

26:21.914 --> 26:22.999
| must take that chance.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.459
No, Merlin. You must not.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.337
| don't understand.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.174
-Do you want to die?
-No,

26:32.133 --> 26:34.135
but neither do |
want you to die.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.388
And die you surely will
if you get too close to Aredian.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.433
He will trap you, Merlin,
he will manipulate you.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.227
And without ever meaning to
you will incriminate yourself.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.939
You must let this go.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.617
| must let you go?

27:03.790 --> 27:06.292
To do otherwise
would be an act of suicide.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.267
(KEYS JINGLING)

27:28.189 --> 27:31.984
Gaius, I hope you have
found some relief

27:32.068 --> 27:33.528
now that your ordeal is over.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.989
Your concern is touching,
Aredian.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.368
Now, will you please,
get out of my sight.

27:40.451 --> 27:41.911
(LAUGHS) Of course.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.331
| just thought you'd want
to hear the news, that's all.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.916
What news?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.086
My investigations have begun.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.672
-Begun?
-Hmm.

27:52.755 --> 27:55.132
But you already
extracted my confession.

27:55.216 --> 27:58.803
Indeed. Which just leaves
Merlin and the Lady Morgana.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.556
But we struck a bargain!

28:01.639 --> 28:03.975
Oh. (LAUGHING)

28:04.058 --> 28:06.102
| don't bargain
with sorcerers.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.065
(LAUGHING)

28:30.793 --> 28:32.003
(GASPS)

28:32.211 --> 28:33.588
Merlin?

28:33.713 --> 28:36.215
-He won't let go. He won't stop.
-What happened?

28:36.299 --> 28:38.593
The witchfinder's questioning
Morgana again.

28:38.676 --> 28:41.095
I'm worried, Merlin.
She's close to breaking point.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.097
That's what he does.
He breaks you down

28:43.180 --> 28:45.725
and in the end you confess
whether you're guilty or not.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.768
-What do you mean?
-Gaius was setup.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.938
-Aredian planted that amulet.
-Why would he do such a thing?

28:51.814 --> 28:53.149
Aredian's paid to catch sorcerers.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.234
Maybe he doesn't care
whether someone is guilty or not.

28:55.318 --> 28:57.945
Maybe he gets confessions
by lying, planting evidence.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.323
Just as long as he gets a confession,
he gets his money.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.659
Even if this is true,
what can we do without proof?

29:05.745 --> 29:06.913
Get some.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.761
-This is hopeless.
-Keep looking.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.388
We don't even know
if this flower means anything.

31:29.472 --> 31:32.308
No, we don't,

For the alleviation of ulcers,
allergies, muscular inflammation.

-This is hopeless Merlin.
-Wait, listen.

"Under certain conditions a tincture of
the flower can produce hallucinations."

31:51.285 --> 31:52.453
GWEN: So?

31:54.205 --> 31:58.167
(LAUGHS) Aredian's witnesses.
It wasn't magic they were seeing,

31:58.250 --> 31:59.627
it was visions.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.172
It makes sense
if he's faking the evidence.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.216
-But how can we prove it?
-Aredian's too clever

32:05.299 --> 32:07.426
to have given them
the tincture directly.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.512
The witnesses,

32:09.595 --> 32:11.263
they must've got it
from someone else.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.224
They could've been getting it
from anyone.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.310
Is there anything at all
that these people had in common?

32:17.103 --> 32:18.229
They were all women.

32:18.312 --> 32:19.605
That doesn't
tell us anything.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.566
Yes, it does!

32:22.650 --> 32:24.568
What's the one thing
only women would buy?

them look beautiful.

-Eye drops.
-Yes.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.946
Women use them to make
their eyes more beautiful.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.281
Where did you get this?

33:10.364 --> 33:11.615
My usual suppliers.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.284
Sure you didn't get it
from someone else?

33:13.701 --> 33:15.077
Of course I'm sure.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.164
Now, if it's all the same to you,
I'd like to get some sleep.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.291
It was Aredian who gave you
the Belladonna, wasn't it?

33:21.375 --> 33:23.335
| don't know
what you're talking about.

33:23.627 --> 33:26.505
But you know that Gaius is gonna be
executed tomorrow, don't you?

33:26.589 --> 33:27.715
That has
nothing to do with me.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.758
That has everything to do with you!

33:29.842 --> 33:31.677
Aredian's
witnesses saw visions.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.138
Visions produced
by the Belladonna in these eye drops.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.225
If we can prove this,

33:39.059 --> 33:40.686
we have a chance
of saving Gaius.

33:48.485 --> 33:52.156
He forced me to sell it.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.035
He said he'd kill me
if I said anything to anyone.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.829
It was him? It was Aredian?

34:00.456 --> 34:02.666
Yes, it was him.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.376
Thank you.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.003
Thank you.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.092
That's it, we've got everything we need.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.344
Is it enough?

34:14.762 --> 34:16.429
<i>We've got a witness as well.
Surely that's enough.</i>

34:16.513 --> 34:18.431
It's still just our word
against Aredian's.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.684
Gwen, we don't have a choice!

34:20.768 --> 34:23.020
By dawn tomorrow
Gaius will be dead!

34:23.478 --> 34:24.605
Merlin, we've only got one chance.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.982
We've got to give Uther
something he cannot deny,

34:27.608 --> 34:30.277
something not even Aredian
can talk his way out of.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.114
I'll be as quick as I can!

36:52.252 --> 36:54.004

36:54.380 --> 36:55.714
It's done.
Everything's in place.

36:55.798 --> 36:57.633
But it's too late! Gaius has
already left the dungeons!

36:58.675 --> 37:02.388
Then we have to
delay the execution!

37:02.471 --> 37:03.597
How?

37:03.847 --> 37:05.140
Arthur, I'll speak to Arthur.

Arthur. Arthur, Arthur,
you've got to stop this.

38:03.699 --> 38:04.950
| can't, Gwen. You know I can't.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.785
Merlin has proof
that Gaius is innocent!

38:06.869 --> 38:09.371
My father has already passed sentences.
Nothing I can do.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.291
You can do the right thing,
Arthur Pendragon!

38:12.958 --> 38:14.543
You can show some faith

to let it happen again?

38:23.218 --> 38:26.138

Sire, the witnesses saw

in these eye-drops.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.433

from this man?

Where did you get it from?

39:17.314 --> 39:19.900
Don't be afraid.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.908

what it was for?

39:29.868 --> 39:30.953
No.

They are absurd.

these lies,

39:45.842 --> 39:47.594

If what Merlin says is wrong,

40:02.067 --> 40:04.194

Aredian...

42:31.216 --> 42:33.677

that he was a sorcerer.

42:34.511 --> 42:35.804
Indeed.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.059
Was there some reason
you wished to see me?

42:43.478 --> 42:44.896
Yes. I...

42:48.692 --> 42:52.654
| wanted to say I'm sorry
if you suffered at his hands.

But I did not suffer
at his hands, Uther.
