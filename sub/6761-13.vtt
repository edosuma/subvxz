01:36.614 --> 01:38.950
You're having a slumber party?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.244
I thought you gave those up
in junior high.

01:41.327 --> 01:44.747
It is not a slumber party.
It's an evening of female bonding.

01:44.831 --> 01:46.749
- Right, Mom?
- Sounds good to me, honey.

01:46.833 --> 01:47.959
- Hi, kids.
- Morning.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.086
- Hi, honey.
- Can you fix me a mug to go?

01:50.169 --> 01:51.838
You're setting a wonderful example.

01:51.921 --> 01:54.090
I gotta be at a staff meeting
in about five minutes.

01:54.173 --> 01:57.468
Don't forget about tonight, Dad.
You're going to stay upstairs, right?

01:57.552 --> 02:00.054
Oh, right, the slumber party.

02:00.179 --> 02:02.723
Didn't you give those things up
in junior high?

02:24.203 --> 02:27.039
- Wanna sign off on this, chief?
- Sure.

02:28.874 --> 02:33.254
- We beat Beverly High in tennis?
- Yeah, not that you'd care.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.463
I care.

02:35.005 --> 02:36.549
So what are you up to tonight?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.760
I've got a women's conference
I'm attending.

02:40.803 --> 02:41.887
At your house.

02:42.847 --> 02:44.640
Wait a minute, Brenda's slumber party?

02:45.975 --> 02:47.560
It is not a slumber party.

02:51.814 --> 02:54.525
Are you sure that this thing
is not a slumber party?

02:54.608 --> 02:56.819
I told you, it's a night of female bonding,

02:56.902 --> 03:00.322
a chance for us to get together
and talk about what's important.

03:00.406 --> 03:02.283
But we're doing it in our PJs.

03:02.366 --> 03:06.245
Well, that would make sense, unless
you'd prefer to sleep in your clothes.

03:06.328 --> 03:08.372
Well, can't we invite some guys
to come over later?

03:08.455 --> 03:11.166
I mean, after we've talked
and bonded and everything?

03:11.250 --> 03:14.378
Kelly, I thought what we wanted
was an evening to ourselves,

03:14.461 --> 03:17.339
where we don't have to think
about guys, or talk about guys,

03:17.423 --> 03:20.384
or worry about what we look like
because some guy is around.

03:20.676 --> 03:21.885
I mean, isn't that what we said?

03:22.845 --> 03:27.266
- So, what's the problem?
- Nothing. Actually, there is one thing.

03:27.349 --> 03:29.434
I kind of made plans
with this other friend of mine,

03:29.518 --> 03:31.478
Amanda Peyser.
You don't know her. She's a senior.

03:31.562 --> 03:34.898
- But we have been friends forever.
- So bring her.

03:35.607 --> 03:37.359
Well, I know this may sound stupid,

03:37.442 --> 03:39.987
but I don't want her to think
that this is a slumber party.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.280
I mean, it's not a slumber party, right?

03:44.324 --> 03:46.576
Guess where we're gonna be tonight?

03:46.868 --> 03:49.579
- You're crazy.
- Wild and crazy.

03:50.789 --> 03:52.999
She's kicking you
out of your own house?

03:53.250 --> 03:54.793
That's bold.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.878
I wouldn't stand for that if I were you.

03:56.962 --> 03:59.214
Well, I don't wanna be anywhere
that I'm not wanted.

03:59.297 --> 04:00.966
Well, what do you say
you and I go out tonight,

04:01.049 --> 04:02.801
try to find some girls who are interested

04:02.884 --> 04:04.386
in having a slumber party
with other guys?

04:04.469 --> 04:06.054
Now there's an idea.

04:06.137 --> 04:08.932
Hey, you guys got your nighties all set
for this evening?

04:09.015 --> 04:10.767
Well, we're sorry
you have to miss it, Steve.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.603
From what I hear, cheap thrills are
about all you're getting these days.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.440
Left you in the dust.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.531
- Your sister dissed me.
- Yeah, kind of, man, but it was weak.

04:32.163 --> 04:33.456
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:33.706 --> 04:37.085
Brenda, Kelly and Donna are here
to bond with you.

04:37.252 --> 04:38.753
Have fun, ladies.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.588
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:40.672 --> 04:42.757
Brenda, this is really weird.

04:43.049 --> 04:46.344
Kelly, we are going to have fun.
Where's Amanda?

04:46.427 --> 04:47.595
Oh, she's coming later.

04:47.679 --> 04:50.640
She wanted to bring her own car
in case...

04:50.807 --> 04:53.017
Something better came along.

04:53.101 --> 04:55.937
I think this might be all
a little too down-home for her.

04:56.020 --> 04:58.189
Kelly, we're not going on hayrides.

04:58.356 --> 05:00.149
Look, why don't you just go upstairs
and change?

05:00.233 --> 05:04.445
All right, but I'm warning you.
I don't have a nightgown.

05:04.529 --> 05:07.073
- I wear men's silk pajamas.
- Whose?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.699
Very funny.

05:21.629 --> 05:23.256
How are we gonna
get in this place, man?

05:23.339 --> 05:26.092
Would you relax? They never card
as long as you're dressed right.

05:27.093 --> 05:29.512
And failing that,
I'll slip the guy 20 bucks.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.348
What's wrong with the way I'm dressed?

05:33.182 --> 05:36.852
- Nice tie.
- Hey, I bought this tie in Canada.

05:39.647 --> 05:40.981
Evening, ladies.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.444
So you really think
you can pick up a girl in here?

05:45.528 --> 05:47.404
I know I can pick up a girl in there.

05:47.488 --> 05:49.365
Wait a minute,
what happens when she asks you

05:49.448 --> 05:51.617
where you live, where you work?
What are you gonna say?

05:51.700 --> 05:53.994
I tell her I work for my father's
import-export company

05:54.078 --> 05:56.539
and go to SC part-time.
What do you do?

05:57.706 --> 06:00.251
I'm a professional hockey player
for the Kings.

06:01.168 --> 06:05.881
No. Say you took a year off from UCLA
to find yourself.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.800
They'll eat that up.

06:08.842 --> 06:10.344
Brenda would love this place, man.

06:10.427 --> 06:13.847
Yeah, by now that party's probably
crashing and burning.

06:13.931 --> 06:16.725
Girls need guys.
They can't have fun without us.

07:19.955 --> 07:21.206
Hello!

07:28.046 --> 07:31.674
- Hello!
- Amanda, hi!

07:33.343 --> 07:36.930
Amanda, this is Brenda, Donna, Andrea,
and Mrs Walsh.

07:37.013 --> 07:38.807
- Hi.
- Hello, everyone.

07:39.140 --> 07:41.601
I thought you said
this wasn't a slumber party.

07:41.684 --> 07:45.563
Excuse me, all. I'm going to bed.
Nice to meet you, Amanda.

07:48.608 --> 07:50.693
Amanda, if you need
a nightshirt or something,

07:50.777 --> 07:53.947
- I have some extras upstairs.
- How sweet of you, Brenda.

07:54.030 --> 07:56.658
Do you mind if I talk to Kelly
for a minute?

07:56.783 --> 07:59.035
Kelly, you can't be serious.

07:59.285 --> 08:02.038
The Pioneers at USC are having
the most amazing party tonight.

08:02.121 --> 08:03.331
We've got to be there.

08:03.414 --> 08:05.208
But we planned on being here,
remember?

08:05.291 --> 08:06.584
That was before this.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.169
Come on, Kelly,
I can't put on a nightgown

08:08.252 --> 08:11.214
- and run around like a schoolgirl.
- You are a schoolgirl,

08:11.297 --> 08:13.591
unless you suddenly graduated
and forgot to clue me.

08:13.674 --> 08:15.718
Well, then I guess I'm a schoolgirl
that gets invited

08:15.802 --> 08:19.263
- to the best frat parties in town.
- Well, have fun.

08:19.347 --> 08:22.391
- Don't tell me you're staying.
- All right, I won't.

08:22.475 --> 08:25.520
Okay. Okay, I'll stay
for a couple of hours.

08:25.603 --> 08:27.855
Maybe by then you'll be bored enough
to come to your senses.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.023
- You're gonna have fun.
- Okay,

08:29.106 --> 08:31.525
but I'm not going to parade around
in some strange girl's nightgown.

08:31.609 --> 08:32.777
Okay. Come on.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.446
Okay. Fine.

08:35.529 --> 08:40.576
Okay, we have chocolate ice cream,
vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup

08:40.659 --> 08:42.828
- and whipped cream.
- Do you have any other cookies?

08:42.912 --> 08:44.080
Yeah. I think they're in the cupboard.

08:44.163 --> 08:46.374
I love cookies smushed in ice cream.
The best.

08:46.457 --> 08:48.459
Do you ever put popcorn
in your ice cream?

08:48.542 --> 08:50.086
Oh, that's disgusting.

08:50.169 --> 08:51.295
No, it's really good.

08:51.378 --> 08:54.173
Well, we have microwave popcorn
in a bowl over there.

08:54.256 --> 08:55.382
- Great.
- Wait.

08:57.218 --> 09:01.180
Okay. Amanda, what do you want?
Do you want vanilla or chocolate?

09:01.263 --> 09:02.556
Nothing for me, thanks.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.142
Oh, come on, Amanda, you're gonna
make us all look like pigs.

09:05.226 --> 09:06.393
You said it, I didn't.

09:19.740 --> 09:23.077
- Donna, that is so gross.
- I know, but I like it.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.163
I don't know why, but I do. Okay?

09:27.623 --> 09:30.250
This is something you can never do
with guys.

09:30.334 --> 09:31.877
- What?
- Pig out.

09:32.669 --> 09:35.339
- Do you eat on dates, Amanda?
- Never.

09:35.839 --> 09:37.883
But I always order something expensive.

09:37.966 --> 09:40.219
- Why?
- To let them know I'm worth it.

09:41.136 --> 09:42.262
Wow.

09:43.138 --> 09:44.556
I knew it was over with me and Steve

09:44.640 --> 09:46.600
when I started pigging out
every time we went out to eat.

09:48.727 --> 09:50.437
He never took you out to eat, Kelly.

09:52.439 --> 09:57.194
Okay. Okay, what's it gonna take?
$40? $50?

09:57.277 --> 09:58.570
- Come on, Steve.
- Chill, Brandon.

09:58.653 --> 09:59.988
Come on.

10:02.783 --> 10:04.826
I'm never coming back to this pigsty.

10:05.368 --> 10:07.204
It's weak anyway.
We're not missing a thing.

10:07.287 --> 10:09.790
- Steve, don't worry about it.
- I can't believe that guy.

10:09.873 --> 10:12.542
He wouldn't even take my money.
What's this world coming to?

10:12.626 --> 10:15.795
You know, I really hate being underage.
It sucks.

10:20.717 --> 10:22.260
- Steve?
- What?

10:22.344 --> 10:24.971
Remember those two girls
who were waiting out in front of the club

10:25.055 --> 10:26.723
when we were trying to get in?

10:28.058 --> 10:29.142
Which ones?

10:29.225 --> 10:31.227
One of them was wearing
a pair of biker shorts

10:31.311 --> 10:34.564
with garter belts sticking out under it,
little stockings, and

10:34.647 --> 10:37.942
the other one's wearing one of those
tops that looks like a bra,

10:38.026 --> 10:41.988
- but isn't a bra, but is a bra.
- Yeah, those. They were hot.

10:42.155 --> 10:46.034
- They're coming this way.
- Oh, I knew we were gonna get lucky.

10:46.117 --> 10:48.203
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:48.286 --> 10:51.122
- I'm Trena. This is Shelly.
- I'm Steven. This is Brandon.

10:51.206 --> 10:53.958
- Hi.
- God, it was so dead in there tonight.

10:54.042 --> 10:57.921
- I don't blame you guys for bailing.
- Yeah, it was kind of beat in there, huh?

10:58.004 --> 11:01.966
- God, I love your car. It's so hot.
- Well, it gets me around.

11:02.091 --> 11:04.344
I want one of these someday.

11:04.552 --> 11:06.304
So, what are you ladies doing
this evening?

11:08.431 --> 11:12.018
I don't know. What are we doing?

11:19.358 --> 11:22.320
- I'm not squashing you, am I?
- No, no, you're fine.

11:22.403 --> 11:25.156
- God, Steve, I love your car.
- Really?

11:25.865 --> 11:28.075
Yeah, I love the stick shift.
Is it hard to drive?

11:28.159 --> 11:32.163
No, not at all. In fact, in a sports car,
a stick's the only way to go.

11:32.246 --> 11:34.248
Puts you at one with the road
and the machine.

11:34.332 --> 11:36.042
Kind of zen-like.

11:36.584 --> 11:37.627
Very.

11:39.545 --> 11:43.132
- You ever driven a stick before?
- No, but I always wanted to.

11:43.215 --> 11:46.135
- Can I shift the gears?
- Go for it.

11:47.845 --> 11:51.932
- Ready. Just tell me when.
- When I say, push it up to third.

11:52.016 --> 11:53.434
Now.

11:54.393 --> 11:55.770
I love it.

11:56.312 --> 12:00.316
God, Brandon, you have
the most beautiful hair. It's so thick.

12:00.441 --> 12:05.070
- It's perfect hair for a convertible.
- Hey, you have very nice hair yourself.

12:05.821 --> 12:10.451
- So, you guys want to go to your place?
- I don't know.

12:11.285 --> 12:12.912
Why don't we go back to your place?

12:12.995 --> 12:14.288
Well, actually, our apartment's being

12:14.371 --> 12:16.707
kind of earthquake-proofed, right, Bran?

12:16.790 --> 12:19.835
Yeah. They're putting in
structural reinforcements.

12:19.918 --> 12:23.130
So we got to stay out all night.
Got any ideas?

12:24.173 --> 12:27.009
Actually, I know this really secluded
parking lot.

12:27.092 --> 12:29.053
It's behind this
boarded-up elementary school.

12:29.136 --> 12:31.013
It's right near here.

12:31.096 --> 12:36.143
- We could sort of hang out and talk.
- Sounds good to me.

12:36.226 --> 12:39.646
- What do you say, Bran?
- I think...

12:41.440 --> 12:42.858
Let's do it.

12:50.824 --> 12:52.701
I am in sugar shock.

12:52.909 --> 12:56.288
I feel like I just gained 10 pounds.

12:57.122 --> 13:00.751
<i>- So what do you guys wanna do now?
- Let's rent Pretty Woman.</i>

13:00.876 --> 13:04.421
- Donna, you've seen that 300 times.
- It's dependable.

13:04.546 --> 13:06.965
You know, sometimes

13:07.174 --> 13:09.968
I think about running away and
becoming a hooker

13:10.051 --> 13:14.055
on Hollywood Boulevard,
just so I can meet Richard Gere.

13:15.682 --> 13:18.768
- There's only one problem.
- What?

13:18.977 --> 13:20.520
You're not Julia Roberts.

13:21.479 --> 13:22.564
Oh, shut up.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.733
What? I'm just being honest.

13:24.816 --> 13:26.985
I wouldn't want you to go
and ruin your whole life.

13:27.068 --> 13:29.154
Look, we are not going to rent a movie.

13:29.237 --> 13:32.073
The whole point of us getting together
tonight was so we could talk.

13:32.157 --> 13:35.410
- What a concept!
- It's turning into a boring concept.

13:35.493 --> 13:38.038
All right, I am going to take these things
into the kitchen.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.040
Kelly, don't panic.
Do you want anything?

13:40.123 --> 13:42.751
No, really. Thanks. I'm full.

13:47.464 --> 13:48.673
Kelly, let's get out of here.

13:48.757 --> 13:50.633
If we leave now,
we'll get there fashionably late.

13:50.717 --> 13:52.927
I don't know. I promised Brenda.

13:53.011 --> 13:56.097
Come on, I would never
put you through this kind of torture.

13:56.181 --> 13:58.433
- Can't you just relax and have fun?
- No.

13:58.516 --> 14:00.977
This is completely seventh grade,
and you know it.

14:02.186 --> 14:05.481
Come on, Kel,
I hate to go to these things alone.

14:05.565 --> 14:08.735
Think how cool it will be.
Look at the option.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.280
- Hey, look what Andrea brought.
- What is it?

14:12.363 --> 14:15.992
- It's a Ouija board.
- Oh, my God, I love these things.

14:16.075 --> 14:17.952
- They are so cool.
- What do you do with it?

14:18.036 --> 14:21.039
Well, you ask it questions.
Contact spirits.

14:21.205 --> 14:22.457
Sorry.

14:22.957 --> 14:24.417
Do you think that we could really
do that?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.169
If the energy is right.

14:26.252 --> 14:29.380
Give me a break!
That thing's a bunch of crap.

14:29.714 --> 14:33.801
I wouldn't say that if I were you.
It's a pretty powerful thing.

14:34.886 --> 14:37.805
- I'm so scared.
- Well, why don't you try it?

14:38.681 --> 14:40.349
Okay, I will.

14:44.979 --> 14:48.107
- I'm gonna go turn off the lights.
- Okay. Great.

14:57.074 --> 14:59.201
Let us all join hands.

15:02.913 --> 15:06.041
We are gathered here tonight as friends

15:06.834 --> 15:09.962
to open the door to the spirit world.

15:14.383 --> 15:18.053
If there are any spirits
who would like to pass through,

15:18.178 --> 15:21.807
this room is a safe haven for you.

15:26.395 --> 15:27.521
Right?

15:27.604 --> 15:28.939
- Yes.
- Yeah.

15:29.023 --> 15:30.691
Give me a break.

15:31.859 --> 15:36.697
Does anybody have anyone
they would like to contact?

15:37.740 --> 15:39.032
Brenda?

15:39.575 --> 15:43.954
- I don't know anybody that's dead.
- Okay.

15:44.621 --> 15:47.374
Why don't we try to contact
my grandma?

15:47.457 --> 15:48.500
Fine.

15:49.793 --> 15:51.003
Okay.

15:51.295 --> 15:54.965
Everybody take two fingers
and place them near the magic window

15:55.048 --> 15:56.800
in the middle of the board.

15:57.968 --> 15:59.511
Now concentrate.

16:05.434 --> 16:07.144
Oh, my God. "l",

16:09.771 --> 16:11.231
"M",

16:13.817 --> 16:14.985
"H",

16:17.571 --> 16:18.905
"E",

16:20.782 --> 16:21.950
"R",

16:24.119 --> 16:25.245
"E".

16:26.121 --> 16:28.290
I'm here.

16:30.792 --> 16:33.211
It spelled, "I'm here."

16:35.005 --> 16:36.339
Grandma?

16:37.966 --> 16:41.011
- What is that?
- She's here.

16:43.179 --> 16:46.099
I'm scared. You guys, I'm really scared.

16:49.602 --> 16:53.356
- I think they're gonna kill us.
- But what a way to go.

16:53.565 --> 16:54.774
What is it?

16:54.858 --> 16:57.777
There's some creep outside
taking photos of us.

16:58.820 --> 17:00.905
Oh, my God. It's David Silver.

17:02.073 --> 17:03.449
Give me that, you little pervert.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.910
You know, you better get out of here
before I call the police.

17:05.993 --> 17:07.537
- Geek.
- Loser.

17:11.165 --> 17:12.750
That was my mom's camera.

17:13.209 --> 17:14.460
Can you believe those guys?

17:14.544 --> 17:17.380
I can't believe such immature people
go to our high school.

17:17.463 --> 17:19.007
Neither can I.

17:20.215 --> 17:22.635
What's wrong?
Are the spirits no longer cooperating?

17:24.011 --> 17:28.433
No, this is... This is too powerful.
I don't think that we're ready for this.

17:30.685 --> 17:32.270
- Damn it.
- What?

17:32.395 --> 17:34.647
- It's after midnight.
- So what?

17:34.730 --> 17:38.985
- Do frat boys turn into pumpkins?
- No. They turn into drunken slobs.

17:39.819 --> 17:42.530
- You sure made my night.
- Amanda, you didn't have to come.

17:42.613 --> 17:45.700
What, and miss all the fun?
The party games?

17:45.783 --> 17:48.786
- Well, why don't you just leave?
- No. I don't want to.

17:48.869 --> 17:51.956
Besides, everyone's ruined my night.

17:52.999 --> 17:55.960
- It's my turn to ruin theirs.
- What are you talking about?

17:56.877 --> 17:59.797
Okay, everyone.
I've got a game if you're up for it.

18:00.381 --> 18:02.800
- What?
- Skeletons in the closet.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.176
What is it?

18:04.260 --> 18:07.096
Well, everyone sits in a circle,
and the person in the middle

18:07.179 --> 18:10.182
has to answer all our questions,
as honestly as possible.

18:10.891 --> 18:12.893
What kinds of questions?

18:13.018 --> 18:16.021
Well, it's up to you.
Whatever you feel like asking.

18:16.105 --> 18:19.191
Of course, the better the questions,
the better the game.

18:21.527 --> 18:24.321
I... I don't know.

18:25.072 --> 18:28.659
- Why? You got so much to hide?
- No.

18:28.909 --> 18:31.412
Look, you guys,
this game can get pretty intense.

18:31.495 --> 18:34.999
- The more intense the better.
- Okay.

18:35.666 --> 18:36.750
Let's do it.

18:38.085 --> 18:39.294
Who wants to go first?

18:46.301 --> 18:47.553
I will.

19:14.287 --> 19:18.166
- Well, it sure is dark.
- And private.

19:19.876 --> 19:21.461
I like private.

19:23.422 --> 19:25.715
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:29.970 --> 19:32.597
- I wanna drive it.
- What?

19:33.139 --> 19:36.434
- Your car. I want to drive it.
- Sure, anytime.

19:36.518 --> 19:39.145
I wanna drive it now.

19:39.854 --> 19:41.982
- Now?
- Yeah.

19:43.066 --> 19:46.444
- It would really make me crazy.
- It would?

19:51.032 --> 19:54.160
Everybody out of the car.
Trena wants to drive it.

19:54.244 --> 19:56.162
- Now?
- Only for a minute.

19:56.246 --> 19:57.872
I wanna drive around the parking lot.

19:59.791 --> 20:01.000
Okay.

20:12.220 --> 20:15.098
Okay, remember what I told you?

20:15.515 --> 20:19.852
It's like an "H." First. Second.

20:20.561 --> 20:22.480
Third. And fourth.

20:22.563 --> 20:25.274
And fifth and sixth,
but don't worry about those.

20:25.733 --> 20:30.488
Okay, got my foot on the clutch.
I'm ready to go.

20:30.571 --> 20:33.991
- Okay, just let up on the clutch slowly.
- Okay.

20:58.975 --> 21:01.686
Easy. She's stripping my gears.

21:14.532 --> 21:16.659
- Had enough yet?
- No.

21:17.284 --> 21:18.744
Come on!

21:20.162 --> 21:21.956
What are you doing?

21:25.626 --> 21:27.253
Where are you going?

21:27.836 --> 21:28.921
What's going on?

21:34.969 --> 21:36.303
Steve, I don't think they're coming back.

21:36.387 --> 21:37.513
Brandon, shut up.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.099
They're coming back, and we're gonna
wait right here until they do.

21:55.864 --> 21:58.033
Steve, we've been waiting here
over an hour, buddy.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.410
- Maybe it's time...
- Brandon, if you want to leave, leave.

22:00.494 --> 22:02.412
But I'm staying here.
I know they're coming back.

22:10.003 --> 22:14.216
So, what do you think they're doing
out there in your car?

22:15.008 --> 22:18.053
I could think of a lot of things.
Like, maybe they went to get us beers.

22:18.136 --> 22:19.680
Or maybe Trena left her purse
at the bar,

22:19.763 --> 22:21.640
and there's a long line,
and they can't get back in.

22:21.723 --> 22:23.725
Brandon, you saw the way
they were coming on to us.

22:23.809 --> 22:27.020
- You can't fake that stuff.
- We got scammed, all right, Steve?

22:27.104 --> 22:28.980
They stole your car
and they scammed us.

22:29.064 --> 22:30.774
And I'm not going to sit around here
any longer

22:30.857 --> 22:32.192
and listen to you
make excuses for them.

22:32.275 --> 22:34.277
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the police. You coming?

22:35.862 --> 22:37.030
No.

23:09.729 --> 23:12.065
I can't believe what a moron I am.

23:13.233 --> 23:14.943
What's my dad gonna say about this?

23:15.944 --> 23:17.362
Just tell him the truth.

23:18.655 --> 23:21.407
He might never let me
live this one down.

23:21.491 --> 23:24.535
What if people at school find out?
I'm gonna be totally humiliated.

23:30.792 --> 23:31.918
You gotta swear.

23:32.001 --> 23:34.003
You gotta swear you're not gonna tell
anybody about this.

23:35.838 --> 23:37.131
Scout's honor.

23:39.425 --> 23:41.886
- What?
- "Scout's honor."

23:43.679 --> 23:46.015
No one's ever said that to me before.

23:47.725 --> 23:50.061
Well, that's the problem, Steve.

23:50.144 --> 23:52.146
Things like this don't happen
to good Scouts.

23:55.775 --> 23:57.818
Is it too late to join?

24:03.324 --> 24:06.661
So, who wants to start?
You can ask her anything.

24:08.454 --> 24:11.874
Okay. What's your middle name?

24:12.500 --> 24:13.542
Marlene.

24:15.252 --> 24:16.545
What's your favorite color?

24:17.671 --> 24:18.756
Fuchsia.

24:19.090 --> 24:22.384
"What's your middle name?
What's your favorite color?" Retch!

24:22.510 --> 24:25.137
The game is called
"Skeletons in the closet."

24:25.513 --> 24:26.847
We're just warming up.

24:28.933 --> 24:30.017
Kelly.

24:31.685 --> 24:35.522
What was your first sexual experience?

24:35.731 --> 24:36.982
Now that's more like it.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.449
Okay. It was with Steve.

24:47.201 --> 24:50.662
After we'd been going out
for about a month,

24:50.746 --> 24:53.624
he started talking about sex constantly.

24:56.502 --> 25:01.006
Neither of us had ever done it,
so naturally we were curious.

25:01.298 --> 25:04.426
But he was definitely more curious
than me.

25:06.136 --> 25:10.641
It got to the point where
all's we would talk about was sex.

25:12.351 --> 25:15.270
How? When? Where?

25:15.979 --> 25:19.232
Anyway, after all the talking
and planning,

25:20.192 --> 25:25.322
we ended up doing it in his bedroom
one day after school

25:26.198 --> 25:30.786
<i>while his mom was downstairs being
interviewed by Entertainment Tonight.</i>

25:32.329 --> 25:34.289
They even talked to Steve afterwards,

25:35.290 --> 25:38.919
and you should see the tape.
He's got this huge grin across his face

25:39.002 --> 25:41.254
the whole time they're talking to him.

25:41.838 --> 25:42.964
No.

25:43.882 --> 25:47.010
Why don't you tell them
about the real first time you had sex?

25:49.137 --> 25:52.307
- That was the first time, Amanda.
- Oh, really?

25:53.266 --> 25:56.394
- Whatever happened to Ross Webber?
- Who's Ross Webber?

26:01.149 --> 26:02.442
Well, come on, Kel.

26:05.111 --> 26:07.238
All right, I'll tell you.

26:10.492 --> 26:15.246
Ross Webber was this godly stud
on the football team

26:15.705 --> 26:18.625
who I had a hopeless crush on
in the ninth grade.

26:18.750 --> 26:21.836
- B.N.J.
- What's that?

26:22.253 --> 26:23.963
Before Nose Job.

26:26.299 --> 26:27.550
Right.

26:28.551 --> 26:29.802
Anyway,

26:31.262 --> 26:34.891
I was working the whole year
at getting close to him.

26:35.767 --> 26:38.936
I started hanging out
with the JV cheerleaders,

26:39.854 --> 26:41.189
going to all the games,

26:41.981 --> 26:45.234
just tagging along
wherever he was going to be.

26:49.781 --> 26:52.700
And one night, after some game,

26:53.784 --> 26:56.579
everybody was getting drunk except me.

26:57.538 --> 27:00.458
And a bunch of us
drove up to Mulholland.

27:02.877 --> 27:04.045
When we got there,

27:05.963 --> 27:10.384
Ross says he wants to take me
to his favorite spot in the woods.

27:14.138 --> 27:17.141
And I'm so stupid, I think,

27:18.809 --> 27:22.021
"Wow, that would be a neat thing to do."

27:24.857 --> 27:26.400
But of course,

27:28.235 --> 27:31.780
when we get there,
all's he wants to do is have sex.

27:36.869 --> 27:38.454
He kept saying,

27:40.623 --> 27:43.626
"Come on, Kel, I know you want it.

27:44.710 --> 27:46.086
"I know you want it, Kelly."

27:49.882 --> 27:51.300
And I did.

27:56.263 --> 27:57.639
But not on the ground.

28:01.935 --> 28:03.687
He didn't even bring a blanket.

28:07.524 --> 28:11.528
And it was over pretty quick.
And after that, he took me home.

28:17.618 --> 28:19.912
And never talked to me again.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.125
Is that what you had in mind?

28:51.526 --> 28:54.362
Okay, fellas. Let me get this straight.

28:54.821 --> 28:57.699
- You met these two outside Floodlights.
- Right.

28:57.782 --> 28:59.367
What were you doing
outside Floodlights?

28:59.451 --> 29:01.077
You gotta be 21 to get in there.

29:01.161 --> 29:02.704
- Well, we were just driving by.
- Right.

29:02.787 --> 29:04.289
And those girls just came up to the car.

29:04.372 --> 29:07.667
And asked you to drive them
to the abandoned elementary school.

29:07.751 --> 29:10.712
- Well, yeah.
- That's trespassing, you know.

29:10.837 --> 29:12.964
But we'll let that slide.

29:13.089 --> 29:14.215
Then what?

29:14.299 --> 29:16.134
Well, then she begged me
to let her drive my car.

29:16.217 --> 29:17.385
In fact, that's all she talked about

29:17.469 --> 29:19.179
- from the second she met me.
- That's right.

29:19.262 --> 29:20.847
- So you let her drive your car.
- Well, yeah.

29:20.930 --> 29:22.974
And then her friend jumped in,
and she kept on driving

29:23.057 --> 29:25.268
- right out of the parking lot.
- But you told her she could.

29:25.476 --> 29:27.687
- Well...
- She had your consent.

29:28.813 --> 29:31.357
- Sort of.
- Sorry, fellas, that's not car stealing.

29:31.441 --> 29:32.483
That's car borrowing.

29:32.567 --> 29:34.861
- What?
- You can't be serious.

29:34.944 --> 29:37.030
Forty-eight hours,
if the car is still missing,

29:37.113 --> 29:38.406
then you can report it stolen.

29:38.489 --> 29:41.034
But until then,
I'm afraid you don't have a case.

29:41.117 --> 29:42.493
Or a car.

29:44.370 --> 29:47.373
Go ahead, ask me anything.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.253
Why does everybody call you "Andrea"?

29:53.838 --> 29:55.923
- Excuse me?
- What, are you British?

29:56.048 --> 29:59.343
I mean, Andrea. God.

30:00.470 --> 30:04.348
- It is pretty pretentious.
- It's pronounced both ways.

30:05.016 --> 30:07.727
But Andrea is...

30:08.227 --> 30:11.397
Well, it's a little boring and common.
I like to be different.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.566
- Good answer.
- Thank you.

30:14.859 --> 30:17.611
- So, am I through?
- No, not yet.

30:20.781 --> 30:23.534
Have you ever slept with a guy before?

30:28.080 --> 30:31.584
- That's really personal.
- That's the point of the game.

30:31.667 --> 30:33.878
If you can't take it,
maybe you should go home.

30:33.961 --> 30:35.087
No.

30:37.089 --> 30:40.801
No, I have never slept with a guy before.

30:42.761 --> 30:44.263
I mean, yet.

30:44.722 --> 30:48.892
Well, if you could sleep with any guy
in school, who would it be?

30:53.355 --> 30:57.067
- Come on, you guys. I can't answer that.
- Yeah, you can.

31:00.237 --> 31:01.780
I don't know, I...

31:02.364 --> 31:05.617
I guess... I guess...

31:06.243 --> 31:09.329
- I guess it would have to be...
- Brandon.

31:09.413 --> 31:11.039
- No.
- No?

31:11.123 --> 31:13.000
No. Not Brandon. No.

31:14.042 --> 31:15.878
You know, it would have to be
Hans Fleischman,

31:15.961 --> 31:19.006
he is this incredibly gorgeous lifeguard
who pulled me out of the water

31:19.089 --> 31:22.175
when I was stung by a jellyfish
at Zuma beach last summer.

31:22.926 --> 31:24.428
Sure, Andrea. We believe you.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.307
What is this?

31:30.183 --> 31:34.271
I told you, Brandon is just a friend.
I do not want to sleep with him.

31:34.396 --> 31:35.981
Wait a second.

31:36.148 --> 31:38.984
Is this the same guy you're always
walking around the halls with,

31:39.067 --> 31:41.820
batting your big cow eyes at every day?

31:41.903 --> 31:43.530
What are you talking about?

31:44.239 --> 31:46.992
Get a life, Andrea.
The whole school knows.

31:47.075 --> 31:48.160
Not that they care.

31:52.455 --> 31:53.540
It's true.

31:57.168 --> 31:58.378
Okay.

32:00.630 --> 32:01.840
Okay.

32:03.258 --> 32:05.010
So it is Brandon.

32:11.307 --> 32:14.019
So who do we call?
Your mom or my mom?

32:14.102 --> 32:16.855
Definitely your mom.
At least she won't hit me.

32:19.607 --> 32:20.942
Hey, kid.

32:21.401 --> 32:25.822
- Your license number l8A 4RE?
- Yeah. Why?

32:25.905 --> 32:28.825
We just picked up two girls
breaking 100, no ID,

32:28.908 --> 32:33.997
driving a charcoal Corvette,
vanity plates, "I ate a Ferrari."

32:34.080 --> 32:35.331
You're kidding. Where are they?

32:35.415 --> 32:36.916
We should have them here
in a few minutes.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.004
Yeah! Justice is served. Yeah.

32:41.087 --> 32:43.840
Come on, Donna,
you got to have some secrets.

32:43.923 --> 32:46.342
I don't. I tell you guys everything.

32:46.801 --> 32:49.971
If you could go out
with any guy in school, who would it be?

32:50.054 --> 32:53.099
Greg Houseman. You know that.
She never stops talking about him.

32:53.182 --> 32:54.267
Well, he's cute.

32:56.144 --> 32:59.605
What is the most dishonest thing
you have ever done?

33:05.945 --> 33:07.363
Nothing.

33:07.446 --> 33:11.284
Didn't anybody in your family go insane
or something? Anything?

33:12.535 --> 33:13.828
No.

33:14.328 --> 33:16.372
We're all really normal.

33:18.791 --> 33:20.584
You know what your problem is, Donna?

33:21.294 --> 33:22.420
What?

33:22.503 --> 33:24.672
Your life is totally boring.

33:25.715 --> 33:28.634
Anybody who can't dredge up
one secret about themselves

33:28.718 --> 33:31.429
is either lying or a total zero.

33:32.888 --> 33:34.140
That is not true.

33:35.307 --> 33:39.103
Why? What are you hiding, Brenda?

33:39.687 --> 33:41.814
- Nothing, Amanda.
- Really?

33:42.439 --> 33:43.774
That's not what I hear.

34:01.125 --> 34:03.377
Those are the girls that stole my car.

34:06.213 --> 34:07.840
- Steve.
- Brandon.

34:07.923 --> 34:10.509
What happened to you guys?
We came back and you weren't there.

34:10.592 --> 34:12.761
What are you talking about?
We waited an hour for you.

34:12.844 --> 34:15.013
An hour?
Do you think we were gone that long?

34:15.097 --> 34:16.764
No, it doesn't seem like it was that long.

34:16.849 --> 34:19.976
Oh, come on, you guys scammed us.
You stole his car.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.353
Brandon!

34:21.478 --> 34:24.690
- What are you talking about?
- We were just fooling around.

34:24.773 --> 34:28.569
We went for a little ride, but I took
a weird turn, and we just got lost.

34:28.652 --> 34:30.571
It was so scary.

34:30.862 --> 34:33.572
We were driving as fast as we could
to get out of there,

34:33.657 --> 34:35.284
and I just kept worrying about you guys,

34:35.367 --> 34:38.120
wondering if I was ever
going to find you again.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.168
Oh, spare me.

34:45.502 --> 34:48.422
Do you really think
we believe that story?

34:55.137 --> 34:58.223
So, are you gonna make this up to me?

34:58.974 --> 35:00.433
Definitely.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.855
- Okay, you can let them go.
- I can't let her go.

35:05.939 --> 35:09.317
She's got a warrant out for her arrest
on a prior speeding ticket.

35:09.401 --> 35:11.695
She's got to pay $150 bail.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.405
And I'm broke.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.157
Steve.

35:20.578 --> 35:22.288
Do you take Visa?

35:25.250 --> 35:29.754
Brenda, what is the most completely
outrageous thing you've ever done?

35:31.881 --> 35:35.176
I went with a bunch of my friends
last summer down to the lake.

35:35.927 --> 35:39.180
And a few of the guys decided
to go skinny-dipping.

35:39.264 --> 35:41.099
- Did you?
- No.

35:41.641 --> 35:44.811
They were just trying
to get us to take off our bathing suits.

35:44.894 --> 35:47.105
So instead, we took theirs.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.986
- How outrageous.
- Why don't you just shut up?

35:54.237 --> 35:55.988
- Did I hit a nerve?
- No.

35:56.072 --> 35:58.074
It's just that you've been acting
like a total bitch

35:58.157 --> 36:02.203
- since the minute you got here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

36:02.370 --> 36:03.663
I didn't mean to be rude.

36:09.961 --> 36:11.379
So, is that it?

36:11.462 --> 36:14.131
No shameless secrets from your past?

36:18.761 --> 36:21.806
- Actually, maybe there is one.
- I knew it.

36:26.394 --> 36:31.023
Back in Minneapolis,
my best friend was Marjorie Miller.

36:33.526 --> 36:36.654
And she was going out
with Jim Townsend,

36:36.737 --> 36:39.532
who I thought was really, really cute.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.955
So, once we were at this party,

36:47.915 --> 36:50.668
and Jim and I were alone,
we were outside or something,

36:53.504 --> 36:55.130
and somehow we started kissing.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.718
Of course, I liked it.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.434
And when Marjorie heard about it
that night,

37:10.479 --> 37:12.022
she called me really late.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.445
It woke up the whole house,
and she was crying, she was hysterical.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.032
She kept saying,

37:23.742 --> 37:25.577
"How could you do that to me, Brenda?

37:28.080 --> 37:29.331
"How could you do that?"

37:34.294 --> 37:36.046
And the part I hate to think about

37:38.465 --> 37:39.800
is that I know why I did it.

37:43.387 --> 37:44.721
I did it to break them up.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.353
Wow.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.648
Did you guys
ever become friends again?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.653
Not like we were.

38:01.071 --> 38:04.908
Brenda, I have a confession
to make to you.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.910
What?

38:07.202 --> 38:11.831
After you started going out with Dylan,
I tried to get a date with him.

38:12.916 --> 38:15.252
- What?
- Brenda, I have always liked him.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.129
And he was flirting with me all last year
before you moved here.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.799
- Did you ever go out with him?
- No.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.801
Well, obviously he wasn't interested.

38:24.678 --> 38:27.305
Okay, Brenda. I get the picture.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.808
I was just trying to be honest. But I...

38:29.891 --> 38:32.102
You know, I thought after what you said,
you'd understand.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.855
What? Understand that you were putting
the moves on my boyfriend?

38:35.939 --> 38:37.941
Look, just forget it, all right?

38:38.191 --> 38:39.901
You know, ever since you started
going out with Dylan,

38:39.984 --> 38:41.778
you have developed
this side to your personality

38:41.861 --> 38:43.196
that's completely unbearable.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.864
Donna, is that true?

38:45.573 --> 38:47.700
Well, you have become a little stuck-up.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.703
Me? You and Kelly
are two of the most stuck-up people

38:50.787 --> 38:53.206
- I've ever met in my life.
- Fine.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.458
I cannot believe you guys.

38:58.544 --> 39:01.255
I came here tonight because I thought
I was gonna make good friends.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.383
You guys are so gossipy.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.928
Thanks for the memories.
I'm out of here.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.139
- So am I.
- Me, too.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.642
Told you
we should have gone to the frat party.

39:12.725 --> 39:13.893
Hey.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.232
We haven't put Amanda in the circle.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.485
That's right, Amanda. It's your game.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.820
Oh, forget it.
You guys are all a bunch of dupes.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.740
I would never tell you anything private
about myself.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.117
- Wished I hadn't.
- Me, either.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.453
Kelly, no.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.498
I'm glad you did.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.213
What happened to you
was a terrible thing.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.257
And I'm glad you told us.

39:46.175 --> 39:49.637
And I guess it's nice to know
that you're really not so perfect after all.

39:52.014 --> 39:54.308
What would ever make you think
I was perfect?

39:55.267 --> 39:59.647
Brenda, I'm sorry. I would never try
and steal Dylan from you.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.362
I lost one best friend
because of some stupid guy.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.908
- I'm not going to lose two.
- Thanks.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.046
And I'm sorry I called you pretentious.

40:24.463 --> 40:29.635
- And I'm sorry I called you gossipy.
- It's okay. Sometimes I am.

40:36.058 --> 40:40.270
Well, I'm sorry
for not having more problems.

40:41.104 --> 40:42.648
But I plan to.

40:43.941 --> 40:47.736
And when I do, I'm going to need
your shoulders to cry on.

40:49.363 --> 40:50.781
Come here.

40:59.498 --> 41:03.710
- Hey, where did Amanda go?
- She left. Good riddance.

41:04.377 --> 41:08.173
- She left her purse.
- Good. Let's throw it out the window.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.304
Oh, my God. What are all these pills?

41:14.387 --> 41:15.847
Let me see.

41:16.723 --> 41:18.642
These are diet pills.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.811
Take too many of these,
and PMS starts to look like a vacation.

41:23.229 --> 41:27.317
- And after seeing Amanda tonight...
- Hello?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.277
Hello, I forgot my...

41:32.030 --> 41:34.824
Give me that. I can't believe
you guys went through my purse.

41:34.908 --> 41:36.534
Amanda, when's the last time you ate?

41:37.660 --> 41:40.288
- What?
- My mom used to pop these like candy.

41:40.371 --> 41:43.041
They kill your appetite
and murder your personality.

41:43.833 --> 41:47.337
- Just give me my stuff.
- Why are you doing this to yourself?

41:47.629 --> 41:50.924
Look, I'm just not lucky enough
to be born as beautiful as you.

41:51.007 --> 41:54.677
- I've got to work at it, all right?
- You are beautiful, Amanda.

41:54.802 --> 41:58.139
Remember me in eighth grade?
Was I beautiful then?

41:58.389 --> 42:00.558
- Yes, you were pretty.
- I was fat, Kelly.

42:00.642 --> 42:02.935
And then you went on a diet
and you lost all that weight.

42:03.019 --> 42:04.145
That's right.

42:04.228 --> 42:07.148
And I swore that no matter what,
I would never be that way again.

42:07.231 --> 42:08.816
No matter what.

42:09.692 --> 42:11.694
Even if it's turned you into a total bitch?

42:13.362 --> 42:15.948
So, what do you want me to do?
Blimp out?

42:16.032 --> 42:18.701
God, guys don't go for fat chicks.
Everybody knows that.

42:18.785 --> 42:20.745
I'm not saying you have to be fat.

42:20.828 --> 42:23.206
But why don't you just relax
and be whoever you're gonna be

42:23.289 --> 42:26.292
- without all these pills?
- God, I wish I could do that.

42:26.834 --> 42:28.753
I really wish I could.

42:30.421 --> 42:32.298
Would it help to talk about it?

42:33.925 --> 42:35.301
Oh, sure.

42:38.554 --> 42:41.557
Guess you guys got me.
My skeleton's out.

42:42.308 --> 42:46.395
I used to be fat, and now I'm thin.
And I'm a bitch.

42:47.438 --> 42:49.774
- Bye.
- Amanda, please don't go.

42:52.401 --> 42:55.738
- Why? Don't you want me to go?
- No.

42:57.364 --> 42:59.575
I want you to stay here
with the rest of us.

43:02.745 --> 43:05.206
Are you sure?

43:08.000 --> 43:09.084
Definitely.

43:10.252 --> 43:11.503
Absolutely.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.010
Okay.

43:18.969 --> 43:20.179
Okay, I'll stay.

43:23.349 --> 43:24.683
Good.

43:32.399 --> 43:34.985
Brenda, do you have any more of those
chocolate-covered cookies

43:35.068 --> 43:36.278
in the refrigerator?

43:36.528 --> 43:39.490
- Yeah, I think there's a whole box left.
- Great.

43:39.573 --> 43:41.617
- Hey, Donna?
- Yeah?

43:41.950 --> 43:44.745
- Will you bring me a couple?
- Sure.

43:45.037 --> 43:48.999
On second thought,
why don't you bring the whole box?

43:50.208 --> 43:51.585
Got it.

43:54.713 --> 43:56.131
Call me anytime.

43:56.256 --> 43:59.593
- I really appreciate this, Steve.
- Well, how about tomorrow night?

44:00.260 --> 44:01.720
Tomorrow's fine.

44:07.476 --> 44:10.061
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:11.897 --> 44:13.106
Yeah.

44:16.026 --> 44:19.696
"This certificate good for one
deluxe manicure at Trena's Nails."

44:21.489 --> 44:24.409
Hey, this isn't what I had in mind
about making it up to me.

44:27.370 --> 44:28.496
What happened tonight, Brandon?

44:28.580 --> 44:30.999
I thought we had it wired
with those girls.

44:31.166 --> 44:34.586
Steve, we got scammed.
But you know what?

44:35.670 --> 44:37.505
I had a blast, man.

44:38.715 --> 44:40.341
Sure beats the hell out
of a slumber party.

44:40.425 --> 44:42.719
- Sure does.
- Maybe Brenda could use this.

44:42.802 --> 44:44.053
Thanks.

44:45.221 --> 44:46.931
"Oh, I'm broke."

44:59.110 --> 45:00.445
Brandon.

45:04.657 --> 45:06.784
Most guys would die to be in this room.

45:06.993 --> 45:08.745
Where have you been?

45:09.954 --> 45:12.874
- Out with Steve.
- Doing what?

45:14.417 --> 45:17.754
Oh, you know, guy stuff.

45:20.131 --> 45:21.674
What'd you guys do?

45:22.258 --> 45:24.886
Oh, you know, girl stuff.

45:26.387 --> 45:27.930
Meaning what?

45:28.598 --> 45:31.225
Meaning you tell me, I'll tell you.

45:34.520 --> 45:38.357
Forget it. I don't even want to know
what "girl stuff" is.

45:38.482 --> 45:40.985
Good. I wouldn't have told you anyway.
