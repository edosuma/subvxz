01:22.166 --> 01:23.667
Thank you.

01:23.801 --> 01:27.138
I'm Jane Deluca.
This is Johnny Figgis and our band.

01:27.271 --> 01:30.541
- I gotta go take a leak, babe.
- Bye.

01:31.041 --> 01:33.110
- Did you see that bitch, man?
- Fuck her.

01:33.244 --> 01:38.582
- I'm going to fuck her.
- Wait. Jane. Jane.

01:39.917 --> 01:44.054
- Girl, that man is so fine.
- Yeah, actually, he is.

01:44.188 --> 01:47.158
- Is this your first date?
- Do you need to clear or something?

01:47.291 --> 01:50.761
You can go ahead and take everything.
Just leave us the glasses. Thanks.

01:50.895 --> 01:53.264
No, no, I was the singer up there.
You didn't see me?

01:53.597 --> 01:56.300
I was, like, signaling
and going like this to you.

01:56.634 --> 01:59.737
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know? Oh, baby.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.740
You had the biggest, greenest thing
hanging out of your nose.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.576
- I kept going like this.
- You could see it from up there?

02:05.709 --> 02:07.812
Baby, it looked like Gumby doing Tarzan.

02:07.945 --> 02:10.214
- It was huge.
- Oh, my God. All right.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.348
You blew my rep, man.

02:11.682 --> 02:14.185
I invite this important A&R guy down,
and you fucked me.

02:14.318 --> 02:17.088
Know what? You're out of here.
You're canceled. Forget it.

02:17.221 --> 02:20.758
- You can't-- Hey, wait.
- Wait for what? Till you learn to sing?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.760
What's up with him? What did he want?

02:22.893 --> 02:26.764
You wanna know what's up with him?
That son of a bitch just fucked us.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.700
You know, this town is dead for me anyway.

02:29.834 --> 02:32.103
We've got that gig in L.A.
We'll just leave early.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.338
Maybe this is trying to tell us something.

02:34.672 --> 02:37.174
It's telling us we're fired.
That's what it's telling us.

02:37.308 --> 02:38.609
Well, no, not just this.

02:38.742 --> 02:42.213
- Maybe L.A. is not the answer to our problems.
- Well, what does that mean?

02:42.346 --> 02:45.282
Well, Tommy hooked me
with some studio work in the city.

02:45.616 --> 02:47.218
It's good money. It's in the city.

02:47.351 --> 02:49.753
And I gotta think of Debbie here,
you know?

02:49.887 --> 02:53.190
Debbie? Isn't that the little girl
in Queens who sets her hair every day?

02:53.324 --> 02:54.859
This is suddenly a factor?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.695
Get the fuck out of the way!

02:58.162 --> 03:00.297
You get the fuck out of my way,
you understand?

03:00.631 --> 03:02.633
Go back to Pakistan.

03:02.766 --> 03:06.237
Look, I gotta be realistic here, all right?
I mean, I gotta look ahead.

03:06.370 --> 03:09.773
How long you been doing this shit?
Seventeen years?

03:09.907 --> 03:13.143
- Look.
- Look what? Look what?

03:13.277 --> 03:16.313
- I don't want that to happen to me. Okay?
- You should be so lucky.

03:16.647 --> 03:19.717
Hey, I got priorities here, you know?

03:20.284 --> 03:22.419
You know, she's holding you back, man.

03:22.753 --> 03:25.256
I mean, everybody says it.
She's like Yoko with bangs.

03:25.389 --> 03:28.325
They don't say she's holding me back, okay?

03:28.659 --> 03:31.328
Look, all I'm saying is,
don't go to L.A., all right?

03:31.662 --> 03:34.398
Even if you don't got shit going on here,
you got voice-over--

03:34.732 --> 03:36.700
Let me tell you something. You stay here.

03:36.834 --> 03:40.671
You stay here and you play Daddy, okay?
I'm gone.

03:41.338 --> 03:43.674
Jane.

04:28.786 --> 04:29.954
So that was in '78, right?

04:30.087 --> 04:33.724
I was supposed to be the new Aretha,
but the old Aretha was the new Aretha...

04:33.857 --> 04:36.393
...and I wasn't either one.
I was something nobody'd seen.

04:36.727 --> 04:38.229
- Sure.
- So I'm getting the fuck out.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.497
- Can I get some French fries?
- Coming right up.

04:40.831 --> 04:44.168
You know, head down to L.A.,
get some gigs going, get that heat happening.

04:44.301 --> 04:48.305
That's perfect, because I can drop you there
and then head on to San Diego on my own.

04:48.439 --> 04:49.473
Great.

04:49.807 --> 04:52.876
- You know, I used to sing too.
- Oh, really?

04:53.010 --> 04:55.946
Nothing professional.
Mostly amateur talent competitions.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.848
<i>- What, like Star Search?
- Sort of.</i>

04:57.982 --> 05:02.353
Only I never made it that far.
I played the piano and sang.

05:02.486 --> 05:03.487
What did you sing?

05:04.355 --> 05:08.492
"Way Over Yonder," Carole King.
"Close to You," Carpenters.

05:08.826 --> 05:11.462
- It was the '70s.
- "Close to You"?

05:11.795 --> 05:12.963
Yeah, you know.

05:13.097 --> 05:15.899
"Why do birds suddenly appear
every time you are near?"

05:19.069 --> 05:21.872
No, no, I know. I know.

05:22.006 --> 05:25.242
- Why San Diego?
- Well, why not?

05:25.376 --> 05:28.379
- Here you go.
- I'm in real estate.

05:28.512 --> 05:31.915
And right now
the market is just unbelievably bad.

05:32.049 --> 05:34.818
And I think sometimes
you have to make a change.

05:34.952 --> 05:38.322
You have to take control and say,
"Things are gonna be different.

05:38.455 --> 05:41.892
I can make them different
if I believe it in my heart."

05:42.026 --> 05:45.329
<i>Hey, fuck Star Search.
You should have been Miss America.</i>

05:45.462 --> 05:47.331
- Okay, bring it on up.
- Bring it up.

05:47.464 --> 05:49.967
More. Good.

05:50.968 --> 05:54.238
I hope you don't mind my mentioning this.
No smoking in the car.

05:54.371 --> 05:55.839
What do you mean, no smoking?

05:55.973 --> 05:58.809
- No smoking in the car.
- Whatsoever?

05:58.942 --> 06:01.278
I'm going uptown. Can I give you a lift?

06:01.412 --> 06:03.313
- Taxi!
- No, I have a car.

06:03.447 --> 06:07.084
- One in which I smoke--
- What do you think? I think it could work.

06:07.217 --> 06:09.053
I'll let you know in a couple of days.

06:09.186 --> 06:12.022
Because I really need to leave
as soon as possible.

06:12.156 --> 06:15.259
And I just don't wanna do it alone.
I don't think that'd be safe.

06:15.392 --> 06:18.862
And you were the first person
that answered the ad.

06:18.996 --> 06:23.267
I think that's a sign of something.
And I think you'd be fine.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.270
I mean,
I think our personalities would mesh.

06:26.403 --> 06:30.340
Look, Robin, right? You're a nice lady...

06:30.474 --> 06:34.144
...and I'm sure there's a lot of things
about yourself you just can't help...

06:34.278 --> 06:37.347
...and I understand that,
but I don't fucking think we mesh at all.

06:38.015 --> 06:40.584
I'm sure somebody out there
wants to go cross-country...

06:40.918 --> 06:42.486
...with the whitest woman on earth...

06:42.619 --> 06:45.389
...singing Carpenter songs
and reliving childhood memories.

06:45.522 --> 06:48.158
But it ain't me. Hey, that's my car, man!

06:48.292 --> 06:53.564
Hey, that's my--! Hey. That's my car.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.535
That's gonna cost at least $200
to get your car back.

07:15.419 --> 07:19.390
Okay, Jane, good luck in L.A., man.
Earthquake. Fire. Riots.

07:19.523 --> 07:22.025
They got some real crazy bastards
out in California.

07:22.159 --> 07:25.062
I don't know why
you wanna go out there anyway.

07:26.163 --> 07:29.433
Careful. Easy, easy with that piano.

08:43.073 --> 08:45.342
Good morning.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.750
Listen, I have a friend in Pittsburgh.

08:54.084 --> 08:58.422
- Do you mind if we stop and take her to lunch?
- Oh, absolutely, no problem. Deal.

08:58.555 --> 09:00.390
Smile.

09:38.161 --> 09:43.534
My brother threw up right here, near Exit 7.
I remember, we pulled over.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.670
How come he's not making this trek
with you down memory lane?

09:46.803 --> 09:48.739
Or does he have a life?

09:49.072 --> 09:53.076
He doesn't. As a matter of fact,
he died of cancer when he was 6.

09:53.210 --> 09:56.647
Oh, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:57.748 --> 09:59.683
Would you mind if I used your headphones?

10:00.317 --> 10:02.486
- No, go ahead.
- Thank you.

10:14.498 --> 10:19.102
<i>Hi. You've reached Nick and Holly.
Leave a message--</i>

10:26.543 --> 10:28.845
There's a sick lady in the bathroom.

10:29.179 --> 10:32.816
- Is she with somebody here?
- She's outside.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.256
- Is that your friend in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.626
Girl, you better get in there.
She in there throwing up.

10:42.759 --> 10:44.461
Thanks.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.568
Are you all right?

10:51.702 --> 10:54.871
That stupid woman. I told her I was fine.

10:55.205 --> 10:58.208
- You look like shit.
- Thank you.

10:58.342 --> 11:00.844
Allergies. I have allergies.

11:01.178 --> 11:04.881
They come and go.
Sometimes I think it's all in my head.

11:05.215 --> 11:07.217
Do you ever knock?

11:07.351 --> 11:09.820
Not in a public toilet, no.

11:11.521 --> 11:12.522
I'm really sorry.

11:12.656 --> 11:14.791
It's probably
because I brought your brother up.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.394
Oh, no, no, it's not. I'm fine.

11:17.527 --> 11:21.431
I'll be fine if we just keep moving. It's nothing.

11:26.236 --> 11:28.872
You smell like an ashtray.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.392
I'm gonna go down to L.A.
and see what I can find.

11:48.525 --> 11:50.794
We're gonna go past-- What?

11:51.595 --> 11:52.596
Are you getting HBO?

11:52.729 --> 11:54.931
We're supposed to get HBO,
and it's not on mine.

11:55.265 --> 11:57.601
- I don't know. I'm on the phone here.
- I'm sorry.

11:57.734 --> 12:00.537
No, come in and check.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.239
Come in.

12:02.739 --> 12:06.810
Yes, I'm on my way to L.A.
You know, I thought I'd stop by and see you.

12:06.943 --> 12:11.748
No, no, I said Tuesday or Wednesday.
Are you okay?

12:11.882 --> 12:13.683
No, it's just....

12:13.817 --> 12:16.186
All right, no, I'll wait.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.687
<i>The Way We Were is on.</i>

12:19.222 --> 12:22.759
<i>Robert Redford? Barbra Streisand?
The Way We Were.</i>

12:22.893 --> 12:24.561
I don't get out much.

12:25.362 --> 12:27.597
It was 20 years ago.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.335
Oh, great, you got it.

12:32.903 --> 12:36.706
- Do you mind?
- No, please, please.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.675
No, I'm here.

12:39.276 --> 12:42.345
No, I figured we'd come by tomorrow
around noon.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.749
Are you okay? I mean, is it Nick?

12:45.882 --> 12:49.286
No. Fine, fine. All right.

12:49.853 --> 12:53.356
Yeah, no, I'll see you then. Goodbye.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.859
Damn.

12:55.992 --> 13:00.897
- Is that your friend in Pittsburgh?
- Yeah, if she is still my friend.

13:01.231 --> 13:05.469
That's nice.
I don't really have any girlfriends.

13:05.802 --> 13:08.805
My mom always felt, you know,
you can't trust women.

13:08.939 --> 13:10.907
I don't know about that.

13:11.241 --> 13:12.676
Oh, come on.

13:12.809 --> 13:16.947
Men know all about PMS. Somebody talked.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.385
<i>Your girl is lovely, Hubbell.</i>

13:22.519 --> 13:25.655
<i>Why don't you bring her for a drink
when you come?</i>

13:25.789 --> 13:26.890
<i>I can't.</i>

13:28.992 --> 13:30.894
<i>I know.</i>

13:41.505 --> 13:43.373
That-- That kills me.

13:43.507 --> 13:48.345
The way she, like,
brushes his hair off his forehead.

13:48.478 --> 13:51.615
Really gets me.

13:53.016 --> 13:55.285
So, well, which one of them were you?

13:55.418 --> 13:58.288
The one who loved too much
or the one who loved too little?

13:58.421 --> 13:59.990
Neither.

14:00.624 --> 14:02.859
I'm the one who spent three years
at happy hour...

14:02.993 --> 14:05.695
...and never went home with anybody
except the bartender.

14:05.829 --> 14:08.932
- Well, the bartender's somebody.
- Yeah.

14:09.065 --> 14:12.435
He was somebody, all right.

14:15.005 --> 14:16.873
I don't know.

14:17.474 --> 14:20.510
I don't know about men.

14:21.678 --> 14:23.780
I just don't get it.

14:23.914 --> 14:26.449
Maybe you're not into them.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.318
You mean...?

14:29.386 --> 14:32.722
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

14:32.856 --> 14:36.726
I think I scare them away
because I know what I want.

14:36.860 --> 14:40.597
Oh, well, tell me, what do you want?

14:41.631 --> 14:44.367
It's not very liberated, I know.

14:48.939 --> 14:52.375
I want a husband with a decent job.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.644
You know?

14:55.846 --> 14:59.683
And I want two kids, a boy and a girl...

14:59.816 --> 15:01.751
...in that order...

15:01.885 --> 15:06.923
...and a saltbox colonial
with three bedrooms...

15:07.057 --> 15:12.829
...a sun porch, a stairway with a white banister
and a convertible den.

15:15.966 --> 15:19.703
You could have been Donna Reed
in another life.

15:19.836 --> 15:24.040
- Anyway, I didn't get it.
- It's all right. There's always time.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.109
Yeah.

15:27.410 --> 15:30.714
Is that why you left New York?
Because that bartender did you wrong?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.716
Something like that.

15:35.085 --> 15:38.622
Eight o'clock tomorrow, okay?
If you wanna get to Pittsburgh by 12.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.960
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:44.094 --> 15:46.062
Thanks for the movie.

16:10.854 --> 16:13.924
So I looked around, got into real estate.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.626
That's where the performing really paid off.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.829
Sizing up situations, handling people...

16:19.963 --> 16:22.866
...getting what you want from them
without them really knowing.

16:22.999 --> 16:26.436
- You know, control.
- Don't worry. You don't have to come in.

16:27.671 --> 16:28.872
I hate this belt.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.541
- It's for your own protection.
- Yes, I know.

16:31.675 --> 16:32.842
- I'll wait here.
- Yeah.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.526
Hey, Holly.

16:51.127 --> 16:52.829
Holly.

16:54.197 --> 16:57.167
Hey, hey. Hey.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.868
- Jane.
- Hey.

16:59.002 --> 17:01.538
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:02.038 --> 17:03.506
You look good.

17:03.940 --> 17:07.644
Thanks. Thanks. You too.

17:09.079 --> 17:12.147
- What's the matter?
- Holly!

17:12.482 --> 17:15.719
Look, something's come up.
Nick's in a mood.

17:15.852 --> 17:17.153
Can we do this another time?

17:18.221 --> 17:22.192
We're on the road here.
Fuck it. I'll handle it. I'll fix it.

17:22.525 --> 17:25.228
- Would you let me talk to him?
- Jane.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.135
- Jesus Christ.
- Holly!

17:35.038 --> 17:38.174
- He thinks he's lost something.
- I thought you said he was clean.

17:38.508 --> 17:41.911
He is. He has nine months in NA.
He's just dealing.

17:42.779 --> 17:48.585
But then, you know,
he has a drink and he gets confused.

17:48.718 --> 17:54.157
Holly, if you cleaned this fucking place up,
maybe I'd fucking be able to find my shit!

17:55.759 --> 17:59.662
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Hello, Nick. I'm just passing through.

17:59.796 --> 18:01.598
We'll catch you later. Come on.

18:03.266 --> 18:05.168
- You think you're going somewhere?
- Nick!

18:05.301 --> 18:07.971
Nick, man, don't be a prick.

18:08.104 --> 18:09.973
Stick to what you know, Jane.

18:10.106 --> 18:12.842
That's something about you girls
I can never figure out.

18:12.976 --> 18:16.713
- What is sex like without a dick?
- I don't know, man. You tell me.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.883
- Fuck you.
- You wish. Come on.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.318
Ain't going nowhere.

18:22.652 --> 18:24.821
Hey, man. Hey, man.

18:24.954 --> 18:26.589
- You dyke.
- Asshole.

18:26.723 --> 18:30.660
Nick! Stop that! Nick, don't hurt her!

18:30.794 --> 18:32.829
- Fucking with me? Fucking bitch!
- Nick!

18:35.598 --> 18:37.634
You fuck.

18:39.169 --> 18:41.304
Bullshit.

18:41.638 --> 18:42.739
Are you all right?

18:45.141 --> 18:49.679
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hi. How are you?

18:49.813 --> 18:52.582
- Are we going?
- Yes.

18:52.715 --> 18:56.319
Nobody's going anywhere
until I get my coke.

18:57.087 --> 18:58.955
This bitch, she stole it.

18:59.089 --> 19:01.224
She ain't seeing daylight till she gives it up.

19:01.357 --> 19:04.594
You don't remember shit when you're drinking,
you asshole.

19:04.727 --> 19:08.998
- You sold it Tuesday night.
- Remember the last time I caught you lying?

19:09.132 --> 19:13.136
- Is that the way you want me to play this?
- Guys, guys, guys.

19:13.903 --> 19:19.309
My hunch is our two positions
might be a lot closer than we think.

19:19.876 --> 19:24.914
- Who do you believe he sold it to?
- Frank, this guy uptown. A friend.

19:25.048 --> 19:26.182
Hey, Nick.

19:26.316 --> 19:30.386
Jane, let me close this.
Where's his number?

19:30.720 --> 19:32.322
It's on the wall.

19:33.890 --> 19:36.025
I'm Robin, by the way. You must be Holly.

19:36.159 --> 19:40.096
- Hi. It's really nice to meet you.
- You too.

19:41.297 --> 19:44.634
I really like your hair.

19:45.034 --> 19:47.904
Thanks. The humidity really messed with it.

19:48.037 --> 19:49.772
- You know how it is.
- I understand.

19:49.906 --> 19:53.843
Is Frank there? Yeah.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.948
Frank.

19:59.082 --> 20:03.219
You score an eighth off me Tuesday night?
Yeah.

20:03.353 --> 20:05.021
How much?

20:05.922 --> 20:08.925
That's what I thought.
Holly's saying you didn't.

20:09.058 --> 20:11.828
All right. Later.

20:14.264 --> 20:16.266
So I sold it to him.

20:16.399 --> 20:19.302
- Okay, fine, let's go.
- Where's the fucking money?

20:19.435 --> 20:21.871
- Oh, man.
- Give us a fucking break.

20:22.005 --> 20:25.074
- Where's the money?
- He hides it. He always does.

20:25.208 --> 20:28.344
The same three or four places,
and I'm not telling.

20:28.678 --> 20:29.913
Tell me where.

20:30.046 --> 20:33.750
I tell you to write it down,
but you never do, so forget it.

20:33.883 --> 20:35.251
You stole it.

20:35.385 --> 20:38.054
- See what I mean?
- Jane, you know her.

20:38.188 --> 20:40.423
- Do you believe this?
- She's a liar and a thief.

20:40.757 --> 20:43.159
- It's not her fault. It's her nature.
- Such an asshole.

20:43.293 --> 20:46.963
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Fuck you too, man.

20:47.096 --> 20:49.799
No fucking trust here.

20:49.933 --> 20:53.803
Get the fuck up. That's what fucking hurts.

20:54.904 --> 20:57.840
Jesus fuck!

20:57.974 --> 21:00.777
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

21:00.910 --> 21:03.079
- Did I hurt him?
- What do you mean?

21:03.213 --> 21:06.716
You hit him with a bat.
I'm gonna call the cops, okay?

21:06.849 --> 21:09.319
Oh, fuck.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.188
He's alive.

21:13.923 --> 21:16.426
Give me the bat. Give it to me right now.

21:18.761 --> 21:22.332
I'm gonna kill you, Holly.
I'm gonna fucking....

21:22.465 --> 21:24.067
- No!
- Time-out.

21:25.401 --> 21:27.270
Nobody move.

21:29.405 --> 21:32.075
Jane, give me the bat, please.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.743
Thank you.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.512
Holly, don't tease him.

21:37.747 --> 21:41.284
And, Nick,
you've got some real likability issues.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.454
Now, who has tape?

21:47.924 --> 21:49.259
I do not feel good about this.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.395
What would you like to do?
Call the police? They'll arrest them.

21:52.528 --> 21:55.265
- There's drugs everywhere.
- What are you doing?

21:55.398 --> 21:56.766
Oh, nothing.

22:00.870 --> 22:03.373
- What are you doing?
- Just the cash. I'm clean.

22:03.506 --> 22:06.009
No, we're not taking drug money
on the road with us.

22:06.142 --> 22:10.113
- Put it back.
- Well, it's not like you can tell by looking at it.

22:10.246 --> 22:13.516
Okay. You have a point.
We'll just take half. All right?

22:13.850 --> 22:18.488
And we're not taking drugs on the road
with us either, so give them back.

22:18.821 --> 22:20.423
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:23.326 --> 22:27.196
We'll take the gag off when we leave.
Then there'll be four hours of loud music...

22:27.330 --> 22:30.900
...after which you can scream for help.
Meanwhile, work on the tape.

22:31.034 --> 22:34.103
- Okay. Phone's in the kitchen. Water?
- Yeah.

22:34.237 --> 22:36.506
Thanks, hon. Right here.

22:36.839 --> 22:39.108
Everyone go potty.
We don't wanna have to stop.

22:39.242 --> 22:41.010
I went.

22:43.513 --> 22:44.981
Look what she's doing.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.017
- Don't tease the animal.
- Go, go.

22:48.151 --> 22:49.952
Let's go.

22:53.256 --> 22:55.525
Let me go.

22:56.359 --> 23:00.296
I'm gonna kill you, Holly!
I'm gonna kill you. Holly!

23:00.430 --> 23:02.131
Come on, let's go. Come on.

23:02.265 --> 23:05.134
I feel really strongly about it.

23:08.871 --> 23:09.906
All right, buckle up.

23:10.039 --> 23:12.542
- Will you close the door?
- Shit.

23:35.298 --> 23:39.869
I am not going over a cliff for you two.
So just forget it.

23:45.308 --> 23:46.943
Fuck.

23:55.384 --> 23:59.956
I've got some friends in Saint Louis.
You remember Linda. I can stay with her.

24:00.923 --> 24:04.026
- So where are you guys going?
- Los Angeles, then San Diego.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.395
Yeah, and you're not coming.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.331
Bummer.

24:08.464 --> 24:12.034
Listen, why did you stay
with this guy so long?

24:12.435 --> 24:16.038
A lot of that back there was drugs.
You know, they really fuck him up.

24:16.172 --> 24:19.208
But he's a really nice guy underneath?

24:19.342 --> 24:21.277
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

24:21.410 --> 24:25.248
It's the sex. Come on. Let's be frank, okay?
He was great in bed, am I right?

24:25.381 --> 24:27.283
Sometimes.

24:27.416 --> 24:31.087
I don't know. I mean,
I think that there's something beyond sex.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.256
Yeah, me.

24:33.389 --> 24:36.392
Well, I don't know,
but I certainly didn't like his attitude...

24:36.526 --> 24:39.462
...and I'm gonna think long and hard
before I take him back.

24:39.595 --> 24:41.531
You go, girl.

24:47.470 --> 24:49.705
<i>Hi. You've reached Nick and Holly.</i>

24:50.039 --> 24:53.943
<i>Leave a message at the sound of the beep,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

24:54.076 --> 24:57.446
<i>- My fucking head. Jesus.
- Friday night, okay?</i>

25:09.592 --> 25:13.129
{\An8}Thank you. Really?
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

25:13.262 --> 25:14.664
<i>{\An8}Dance Fever was my favorite.</i>

25:14.997 --> 25:18.501
{\An8}I thought Deney Terrio was, like,
the coolest guy on the Earth.

25:19.368 --> 25:23.272
Will you look at her?
It's pathological, man.

25:24.373 --> 25:27.343
- She's young.
- I guess.

25:28.177 --> 25:30.046
How you doing?

25:30.179 --> 25:33.549
Me? I'm fine. A little tired.

25:33.683 --> 25:36.986
Well, you were great back there.
You must have sold a ton of condos.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.722
It was kind of fun. Adrenaline.

25:40.056 --> 25:44.493
Well, you were very frightening.
I was very proud of you.

25:45.494 --> 25:48.064
It was really nice meeting you.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.234
Bye.

26:01.611 --> 26:03.512
Yes.

26:04.714 --> 26:06.115
Is Robin asleep already?

26:06.249 --> 26:09.418
Yeah, you know, she gets tired real easy.

26:10.253 --> 26:11.754
You know, she doesn't look so good.

26:12.088 --> 26:15.625
She's got all those allergies, man.
You know, they come and go.

26:15.758 --> 26:17.760
Did you call Linda yet?

26:18.094 --> 26:19.362
Yeah. I was thinking, though.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.665
You guys can go ahead and leave tomorrow,
and I'll just grab a bus.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.201
Well, why?
We're going right through Saint Louis.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.136
I mean, it's no big....

26:31.307 --> 26:34.377
- You're going back, aren't you?
- Might as well.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.178
What do you mean, might as well?

26:36.312 --> 26:39.715
This is a guy who kicks your ass all the time.
This is not love, honey.

26:40.049 --> 26:44.086
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Look, the man is gonna kill you.

26:44.220 --> 26:48.557
We humiliated him. We tied him up.
Come on.

26:49.125 --> 26:52.261
I mean, I can't always do
what you think I should do.

26:52.395 --> 26:55.765
- Like, we've been there, Jane.
- Fine.

26:56.098 --> 27:00.269
I just don't understand why you keep
setting yourself up to get hurt, that's all.

27:01.070 --> 27:04.173
- You should talk.
- What does that mean?

27:04.307 --> 27:08.144
Look, you guys have been really great,
and I really like Robin and....

27:08.277 --> 27:11.647
- I just hope that you know she's not gay.
- Well, so what?

27:12.281 --> 27:15.518
So that's what I meant
by saying you should talk.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.600
Nick.

27:32.501 --> 27:35.838
Nick? Nicky?

27:38.407 --> 27:41.143
Oh, shit.

27:41.277 --> 27:44.213
<i>Bus to Pittsburgh is now arriving.</i>

27:44.347 --> 27:48.551
<i>Passengers with tickets,
please go directly to the boarding area.</i>

27:48.684 --> 27:51.454
<i>Those passengers still needing tickets...</i>

27:51.587 --> 27:54.724
<i>...please purchase them at the ticket window.</i>

27:54.857 --> 27:58.327
<i>Please take all luggage
to the baggage-loading area.</i>

27:58.461 --> 28:00.229
Here we are.

28:02.398 --> 28:04.233
Take care of yourself.

28:04.367 --> 28:05.701
You too.

28:05.835 --> 28:07.903
- Get some sunshine, okay?
- Okay.

28:08.237 --> 28:10.339
- Promise? Okay.
- Yeah.

28:10.473 --> 28:12.775
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

28:12.908 --> 28:15.778
- Bye, Jane.
- Bye.

28:19.215 --> 28:21.217
She'll get over it.

28:22.151 --> 28:23.252
See you.

28:23.386 --> 28:25.921
- Thank you.
- It's her life, you know.

28:26.255 --> 28:30.426
Yeah, but she gives us all a bad name
with that "I'm addicted to a bad guy" stuff.

28:30.559 --> 28:33.796
- Good.
- Thank you. I hope everything was satisfactory.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.798
Actually....

28:38.401 --> 28:40.336
The green on Number 8 is a little rough.

28:40.469 --> 28:44.273
Oh, really?
Well, we'll check it out as soon as we can.

28:44.407 --> 28:46.275
Is there anything else?

28:49.712 --> 28:52.581
- Jane!
- What? What?

28:52.715 --> 28:56.485
Why are you screaming like that? What?

28:58.587 --> 29:00.589
Oh, shit.

29:08.297 --> 29:10.733
Move closer. Just a little bit closer.

29:10.866 --> 29:13.602
- Okay, there she is. Okay.
- All right, there she is.

29:13.736 --> 29:18.708
Holly! Holly!

29:18.841 --> 29:23.312
Holly! Holly!

29:23.946 --> 29:28.818
Holly! Holly! Holly! Hi.

29:31.654 --> 29:34.857
Nick's dead.

29:37.293 --> 29:39.328
Nick's:

29:42.398 --> 29:44.467
Sounds like "head."

29:46.569 --> 29:49.805
- He's-- Oh, wait, I have an idea.
- What are you gonna do?

29:49.939 --> 29:51.607
No.

29:52.508 --> 29:53.509
What are you writing?

29:54.543 --> 29:57.346
- She's not gonna know what you're--
- It's French for "dead."

29:57.480 --> 29:59.515
I can't write "dead" because....

29:59.648 --> 30:01.984
Who's Morte?

30:02.318 --> 30:03.586
Wait.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.923
<i>- Dead!
- What?</i>

30:15.364 --> 30:18.267
Get off the bus!

30:19.468 --> 30:22.738
I can't believe this.
I mean, he was alive when we left.

30:22.872 --> 30:25.875
I have a photo. Do you think it would help?

30:29.311 --> 30:32.982
Poor Nick.
He was such a nice guy, once in a while.

30:33.315 --> 30:37.052
Stop with the "nice guy" stuff.
They have to believe this was self-defense.

30:37.386 --> 30:40.055
- Who's "they"?
- What do you mean? The cops in Pittsburgh.

30:40.389 --> 30:42.491
You want me to go back there?

30:42.625 --> 30:43.659
- Yeah.
- Now?

30:43.793 --> 30:44.860
- Yes.
- I couldn't.

30:44.994 --> 30:46.662
Why not?

30:46.796 --> 30:49.298
- The memories.
- What fucking memories?

30:49.431 --> 30:52.701
Why does she have to go back?
Why don't we pretend we never saw it?

30:52.835 --> 30:54.837
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- No.

30:54.970 --> 30:56.438
When we left, he was alive.

30:56.572 --> 30:58.574
How do we know
that what she did killed him?

30:58.707 --> 31:01.677
Exactly. He could have tripped
and hit his head on the bat.

31:01.811 --> 31:03.512
- It could happen.
- No.

31:03.646 --> 31:05.581
You're going back. This is not a game.

31:05.714 --> 31:08.317
I can't go to jail. Not with a baby.

31:09.819 --> 31:11.320
What baby, honey?

31:13.956 --> 31:15.658
I'm eight weeks pregnant.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.661
What--? You were gonna bring a baby
into that house?

31:18.794 --> 31:20.029
Like, what were my options?

31:20.362 --> 31:22.097
- How about abortion?
- Couldn't do that.

31:22.431 --> 31:26.502
- I'd feel like a murderer.
- Honey, you are a murderer.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.704
Oh, God.

31:29.438 --> 31:32.074
To think it's possible
I killed my baby's daddy.

31:32.408 --> 31:33.642
To think it's possible?

31:33.776 --> 31:37.046
You hit him in the head with a baseball bat.
He's dead.

31:37.379 --> 31:40.716
No, I mean,
it's possible that Nick is the daddy.

31:46.021 --> 31:48.757
We never saw the newspaper.
She hit him in self-defense.

31:48.891 --> 31:51.360
She split. She's never gonna see him again.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.029
I'll call my lawyer in New York.
He'll tell us what to do.

31:54.363 --> 31:57.533
If we have to go back,
we'll say we came as soon as we found out.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.536
That's fine with me.
I suggest we keep driving.

32:00.669 --> 32:01.971
We sleep in shifts.

32:02.104 --> 32:05.708
The farther away from that body I get,
the happier I'll be.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.937
She wrote
"The Ballad of the Lonely Masturbator--"

32:35.070 --> 32:36.772
Here, try this. It's really good.

32:36.906 --> 32:38.841
--"In Celebration of my Uterus--"

32:38.974 --> 32:40.809
- Anne Sexton.
- Did you go to college?

32:42.011 --> 32:43.846
I'm wet.

32:48.884 --> 32:52.187
No, no. Hold it. Stop the car. Stop. Back up.

32:52.521 --> 32:54.423
You're getting out and picking it up.

32:54.556 --> 32:55.991
- Fine.
- Honestly.

32:56.125 --> 32:57.526
I'll go get it.

32:57.660 --> 33:00.429
Keep your world clean.
Don't go leaving messes everywhere.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.831
All right.
I don't know what you're bitching about.

33:02.965 --> 33:07.903
- It's all biodegradable.
- It's plastic. Now, don't you feel better?

33:38.734 --> 33:41.170
Nick had this house
with this drummer that Jane knew...

33:41.503 --> 33:42.972
...and we'd all hang out together.

33:43.105 --> 33:47.142
But then Nick pissed some people off,
so we had to move to Pittsburgh.

33:47.476 --> 33:49.778
Can I have a bite of that?

33:49.912 --> 33:52.681
Yeah, well, it's been a long couple of days.

33:52.815 --> 33:56.752
- Yeah. Tell me about it.
- Jane's been so great to me.

33:56.885 --> 34:01.790
I mean, at first I thought she just liked me
because of the whole gay thing.

34:03.092 --> 34:04.493
Jane's gay?

34:05.160 --> 34:08.163
Like, hello? You didn't know?

34:08.496 --> 34:11.800
I don't know. Just.... Don't look, don't look.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.570
Oh, my God.

34:17.940 --> 34:21.643
It's okay. It's okay.

34:22.077 --> 34:25.880
Anyway, she just got dumped.
So, you know, rebound time.

34:27.983 --> 34:31.152
I know. Gross, but don't worry,
she won't try anything...

34:31.286 --> 34:33.088
...especially not after me.

34:33.222 --> 34:37.793
I told her that it was a real self-hating thing
to get crushes on straight girls.

34:37.926 --> 34:41.897
But this person who dumped her,
she was gay, right?

34:42.031 --> 34:45.734
Yeah, but I mean, even with gay girls,
there are no guarantees.

34:45.868 --> 34:48.036
They're very emotional.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.871
That's about all I know.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.940
They love uniforms,
and don't break their hearts.

34:53.074 --> 34:57.112
- Uniforms?
- Oh, yeah, all kinds. Especially UPS.

34:57.246 --> 34:59.181
Will that be all?

35:02.651 --> 35:04.286
- Yeah.
- I'll get the check.

35:04.620 --> 35:07.256
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

35:08.290 --> 35:11.894
Not that I'm an expert.
I mean, she's the only one I've ever seen...

35:12.027 --> 35:15.864
...except for the girls in the porno tapes
Nick used to rent.

35:26.775 --> 35:28.744
I'm sorry.

35:30.312 --> 35:33.849
It's just, every time I think of his little ways....

36:18.127 --> 36:20.395
Try to look a little more Western.
That's good.

36:20.729 --> 36:24.399
- Take the picture.
- You sort of need to do something.

36:26.001 --> 36:29.271
- Here.
- That's cute.

36:52.794 --> 36:56.331
Hey, hey, hey. Who you calling?

36:56.665 --> 36:59.735
- Who you calling?
- I was calling a friend.

36:59.868 --> 37:01.970
No, you can't call that friend. He's dead.

37:02.104 --> 37:05.073
And you're not supposed to know he's dead.

37:05.941 --> 37:08.310
But I want my friend.

37:08.443 --> 37:10.779
I want Nick.

37:16.285 --> 37:19.821
- Will you come talk to Holly, please?
- Don't come in.

37:19.955 --> 37:21.156
What's the matter?

38:03.799 --> 38:05.100
- Miss Deluca?
- Yeah.

38:05.234 --> 38:06.401
Susan Newbauer.

38:06.735 --> 38:09.137
She asked me to talk to you. It's pneumonia.

38:09.271 --> 38:11.273
We'll have to keep her for a couple days.

38:11.406 --> 38:13.909
- Can we see her?
- Tomorrow, after 11.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.245
Just go on up to the eighth floor.

38:16.378 --> 38:19.381
It's typical
in this kind of AIDS-related pneumonia.

38:20.082 --> 38:21.984
AIDS?

38:22.751 --> 38:26.455
- You're telling me she's got AIDS?
- Yes.

38:29.992 --> 38:32.060
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

38:33.362 --> 38:35.030
No, I didn't.

38:35.163 --> 38:38.066
She's okay. She'll be out in less than a week.

38:42.037 --> 38:45.240
Get this filled right away, please. Thank you.

39:07.329 --> 39:09.231
How you doing?

39:11.199 --> 39:13.035
I'm okay.

39:17.339 --> 39:18.473
I'm sorry.

39:18.807 --> 39:21.810
For what?
It's not like you knew this was gonna happen.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.378
No.

39:26.381 --> 39:32.988
I thought if I could just go somewhere else...

39:33.121 --> 39:36.925
...I could make it not happen.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.565
I shouldn't have lied to you.

39:44.566 --> 39:48.236
It wasn't a lie exactly.
It was more like a sin of omission.

39:48.370 --> 39:52.274
- Can I sit down?
- Sure.

39:58.046 --> 40:00.582
So I guess now we're even, huh?

40:02.250 --> 40:03.485
How so?

40:03.618 --> 40:06.321
Well, Holly told me
you didn't know I was gay.

40:06.455 --> 40:11.626
I don't want you to worry,
because, you know, I'm not after you.

40:12.928 --> 40:15.030
I'm not worried.

40:18.934 --> 40:20.135
Why?

40:20.936 --> 40:22.871
Luck of the draw, I guess.

40:23.004 --> 40:26.274
No, I mean, why aren't you after me?

40:26.408 --> 40:28.510
Because you're not my type.

40:37.285 --> 40:40.021
Is this a black-white thing?

40:41.356 --> 40:42.958
No.

40:43.091 --> 40:47.629
It's more like a blonds-Carpenter thing.

40:53.235 --> 40:55.070
You're safe with me.

41:02.978 --> 41:07.449
Is there somebody I should call or something?
You know, like family?

41:13.054 --> 41:14.122
My mother.

41:14.256 --> 41:18.660
But we don't communicate much,
not anymore.

41:20.128 --> 41:22.564
What about you? You've gotta get to L.A.

41:31.406 --> 41:34.409
Would you get me some ice?

41:35.610 --> 41:37.112
Sure.

41:47.689 --> 41:52.060
What's the matter? What is it?
What is it? Goddamn it. Damn it.

41:52.194 --> 41:55.363
Wait, wait, wait.

41:59.034 --> 42:02.504
What is it? Are you in pain?

42:03.171 --> 42:04.739
What is it?

42:06.575 --> 42:08.643
I don't know where to go.

42:08.977 --> 42:15.083
I don't.... I don't have any place to go.
I don't....

42:15.217 --> 42:18.386
I don't know any place, Jane.

42:20.222 --> 42:22.691
Okay, okay, okay.

42:31.333 --> 42:34.569
Sometimes if you don't have
any place to go...

42:34.703 --> 42:38.273
...it's probably a good idea
to stay where you are.

42:38.406 --> 42:40.575
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42:41.576 --> 42:43.078
All right?

42:44.212 --> 42:47.015
Yeah, you're okay.

42:48.517 --> 42:50.051
Okay.

42:50.185 --> 42:53.755
All right. Here, put your arm up.

42:56.625 --> 42:58.560
Oh, Jesus.

43:10.505 --> 43:13.542
This may be the wrong time
to bring this up...

43:14.276 --> 43:18.513
...but where the fuck are we?
I mean, really, where are we?

43:19.180 --> 43:20.482
Tucson.

43:20.615 --> 43:24.085
As in Arizona? Are you serious?

43:24.219 --> 43:25.554
You know what this means?

43:25.687 --> 43:28.290
I'm gonna have to go out
and get some cowboy boots.

43:28.423 --> 43:30.592
What about a horse?

43:40.368 --> 43:44.272
Okay, good.
No, I'm just gonna go straight from work.

43:44.406 --> 43:45.807
Yeah.

43:48.143 --> 43:49.678
Yeah.

43:53.114 --> 43:54.549
- Okay.
- I'm leaving now, Holly.

43:54.683 --> 43:56.551
So if you're coming, get off the phone.

43:56.685 --> 43:58.687
- He's coming.
- Great.

43:58.820 --> 44:02.290
Okay, I gotta go. Yeah. Okay, bye.

44:02.424 --> 44:04.159
We still have to pick up the cake.

44:04.292 --> 44:08.597
- Do you think she's gonna be surprised?
- That's the idea. Hurry up.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.098
Okay.

44:10.231 --> 44:13.835
I'll pick up the cake, because I have to drop by
the hospital for a blood test.

44:14.169 --> 44:17.105
Okay, and I told Abe
to meet us there around....

44:17.572 --> 44:21.242
- What? Are you okay?
- Kicking all morning long.

44:21.376 --> 44:25.213
I told him to meet us there around 10.
I think that you're gonna like him.

44:25.347 --> 44:28.350
Listen, I like any man
who dates a pregnant woman.

44:28.483 --> 44:31.453
I wonder about him, but I like him.
Are you ready?

44:31.586 --> 44:33.455
- Yeah.
- Okay.

44:47.469 --> 44:49.738
Hey, you're looking good tonight.

44:52.374 --> 44:55.443
Two hands. In this bar,
we wash the glasses with two hands.

44:55.577 --> 44:58.880
That's the difference between clean
and absolutely fucking disgusting.

44:59.214 --> 45:01.249
Watch your language.
Bambinos are coming.

45:01.383 --> 45:03.385
- Hi, Mom. Hey, Alex.
- What's up, Alex?

45:03.518 --> 45:07.756
Come on. Get in the kitchen and stay there.
She sees you two, the cat is out of the bag.

45:07.889 --> 45:11.426
- Give me a beer.
- No, there's no time.

45:12.727 --> 45:17.532
Is there no mercy? I can't believe it.
A body like that on a 12-year-old.

45:30.912 --> 45:33.448
That's enough candles.

45:35.517 --> 45:37.352
Come on. We all know she's not 12.

45:37.485 --> 45:39.454
- It's not polite.
- It'd hurt her feelings.

45:39.587 --> 45:41.456
I thought I'd never get here. Am I late?

45:41.589 --> 45:43.425
- No, no, no. It's okay.
- Oh, great.

45:43.558 --> 45:45.460
Hey, you ready?

45:45.593 --> 45:47.328
All right.

45:48.229 --> 45:50.198
Nice cake.

46:09.684 --> 46:12.253
Blow out the candles.

46:33.975 --> 46:37.412
Come on, girl. Move that cute little ass.

46:39.247 --> 46:40.982
Can I have a light?

46:46.521 --> 46:48.556
Give me that thing.

46:54.562 --> 46:56.965
You're such a slut.

47:26.060 --> 47:29.664
I don't know. It's like gay people
are the only people getting laid anymore.

47:29.797 --> 47:31.866
Maybe you ought to try it.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.601
I like being straight.

47:33.735 --> 47:36.471
You know, I think heterosexuality's
gonna make a comeback.

47:36.604 --> 47:39.040
Not if you have anything to do with it.
Go dance.

47:39.374 --> 47:40.909
Excuse me.

47:44.546 --> 47:50.418
- So, Robin, would you like to dance?
- Yeah? Yeah.

48:11.372 --> 48:13.408
- Oh, Jesus.
- She did it.

48:13.541 --> 48:16.778
- He did it, he did it.
- I just love that stick.

48:16.911 --> 48:20.582
My dream evening. Lesbians and cops.
What's next, Republicans?

48:20.715 --> 48:22.850
It's a cop. Cop.

48:24.986 --> 48:26.654
Cop.

48:26.788 --> 48:29.757
- It's a cop.
- Evening, ladies.

48:30.959 --> 48:32.126
Sir.

48:32.460 --> 48:34.028
I'm looking for a Holly Pulchik.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.734
- Who?
- Holly Pulchik.

48:39.867 --> 48:43.037
She's got blond hair, green eyes, about 5'4".

48:43.371 --> 48:45.974
- Gee....
- Hey.

48:46.107 --> 48:48.776
- You made it.
- There she is.

48:48.910 --> 48:51.112
I was afraid some crime
would keep you away.

48:51.446 --> 48:53.481
No, it couldn't.

48:54.048 --> 48:56.084
It happens to be a slow night.

48:56.417 --> 48:58.486
But Friday, Friday is the 1st.

48:58.620 --> 49:00.822
When they get their checks,
we have to be ready.

49:00.955 --> 49:04.058
It's time to go. Good night, everyone.
We're gonna clean up.

49:04.392 --> 49:06.427
Excuse me.
Nice to meet you, Officer Lincoln.

49:06.561 --> 49:10.565
No, no, please. Call me Abe.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.801
Abe?

49:13.935 --> 49:17.939
- As in Abe Lincoln? What is this, a joke?
- No, it's his name.

49:18.072 --> 49:20.675
Isn't that a coincidence?
Just like the president.

49:20.808 --> 49:26.414
I mean, I wonder why his parents thought
Abraham and Lincoln sounded good together.

49:27.682 --> 49:30.184
Now, let me guess. You must be Robin.

49:31.552 --> 49:32.787
Nice to meet you, Robin.

49:33.421 --> 49:35.990
- And this is Jane.
- Hello.

49:36.124 --> 49:38.893
Hi, Jane. Happy birthday.

49:39.027 --> 49:41.763
Oh, thank you. Peppers.

49:41.896 --> 49:46.200
- Yes, they're from my garden.
- Isn't he sweet?

49:46.868 --> 49:48.836
Hold on, babe.

49:48.970 --> 49:51.973
You know that I'm still in uniform.

49:52.473 --> 49:56.844
Isn't that cute? He takes it so serious.

49:56.978 --> 49:59.714
Come on, honey. Let's go get a drink.

49:59.847 --> 50:02.450
What will you have, babe?

50:05.753 --> 50:10.758
Is it me, or is she working her way down some
weird list of guys who call women "babe"?

50:10.892 --> 50:14.462
- I hope she keeps her mouth shut.
- Right.

50:14.595 --> 50:16.164
Where are you and Anna going again?

50:16.497 --> 50:19.200
She's taking me
to see some type of psychic.

50:19.534 --> 50:21.469
Here's your buddy.

50:23.938 --> 50:27.241
- Robin, do you need a ride home?
- Oh, I have a car.

50:27.575 --> 50:29.644
Oh, no. Didn't I tell you?

50:29.777 --> 50:32.180
Holly came up to me inside
and said she needed the car.

50:32.513 --> 50:33.748
- It's right on my way.
- Yeah.

50:33.881 --> 50:38.152
- Thanks.
- Oh, could you take these for me? Thanks.

50:39.987 --> 50:41.656
- Good night.
- Thanks.

50:42.857 --> 50:44.759
Jane.

50:45.660 --> 50:48.496
I don't wanna be late for this woman.
She scares me.

50:48.629 --> 50:50.498
Okay. Let's go.

50:50.631 --> 50:55.169
She is really good.
You have to be prepared when you get there.

51:03.611 --> 51:04.679
Here we go.

51:07.615 --> 51:10.718
There's a long trip here. Traveling.

51:12.520 --> 51:17.658
This is nice. You're in love.
This is very nice. Yes.

51:18.693 --> 51:19.994
And....

51:23.297 --> 51:24.966
What?

51:26.000 --> 51:28.703
This is a friend. I feel....

51:30.071 --> 51:31.739
This is not good at all.

51:31.873 --> 51:37.612
There's a sickness here.
There's a curse. Yes?

51:37.745 --> 51:42.583
Yes. This is a curse. I can feel it.

51:42.717 --> 51:45.686
- Can you do anything to remove the curse?
- Anna.

51:45.820 --> 51:49.624
- No, she can do that. Last year--
- Anna, sit down.

51:49.757 --> 51:52.193
Let me talk to my guides.

51:55.062 --> 51:57.265
You're gonna talk to these rocks?

51:57.598 --> 52:00.301
You're talking to these
and they're gonna say something to you?

52:00.635 --> 52:02.270
Uncross your legs, dear.

52:09.744 --> 52:10.845
You want some?

52:11.646 --> 52:14.048
Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks.

52:14.182 --> 52:17.819
- How was the psychic?
- Don't ask.

52:21.155 --> 52:25.092
How was Alex?
He leave fingerprints all over you?

52:26.027 --> 52:29.964
- What is it with me and bartenders?
- I don't know.

52:30.832 --> 52:34.302
He's coming with us Saturday night
to the street fair.

52:34.635 --> 52:39.273
Good, there's safety in numbers.
Just don't let him get you by yourself.

52:43.911 --> 52:48.049
- I cannot believe it's a cop.
- He's cute, though, huh?

52:48.182 --> 52:50.351
Yeah, for a cop.

52:50.685 --> 52:53.154
He does have a nice heinie.

52:53.721 --> 52:55.389
Heinie?

52:55.723 --> 52:58.993
What, is he 2 years old?
He has a nice heinie?

52:59.393 --> 53:00.695
Don't laugh.

53:00.828 --> 53:05.833
And don't think that I didn't see you
checking out that man's basket.

53:07.335 --> 53:09.036
What do you call it?

53:09.170 --> 53:10.705
I don't call it anything.

53:10.838 --> 53:13.875
I just wasn't brought up
to talk about a person's anatomy.

53:14.008 --> 53:16.077
That's because you don't have a word for it.

53:16.210 --> 53:19.881
That's just ridiculous. I do too.
It just doesn't often come up.

53:20.014 --> 53:23.217
Okay. What is this?
Below the belly button?

53:24.018 --> 53:26.888
I'm not gonna say "pussy,"
if that's what you're after, okay?

53:27.021 --> 53:29.223
- I hate that.
- Okay.

53:29.357 --> 53:30.858
So, what do you call it?

53:31.893 --> 53:34.695
- "Down there."
- Oh, come on. "Down there."

53:34.829 --> 53:38.399
- Well, "vagina" seems so formal.
- But you make it sound like a basement.

53:38.733 --> 53:40.034
- Okay. Honestly?
- Yeah.

53:40.167 --> 53:42.870
Fine. "Hoo-hoo" or "cissy."

53:43.905 --> 53:46.974
You're kidding, right?
A hoo-hoo or a cissy? What is that?

53:47.108 --> 53:48.809
That's what my mother called it.

53:48.943 --> 53:52.313
I had a hoo-hoo or a cissy,
and my brother had a noodle or a dingle.

53:52.446 --> 53:54.415
And that's what you still call it, huh?

53:55.316 --> 54:00.021
It's better than "pussy."
Or "beaver." What's that about?

54:00.154 --> 54:03.357
I never got that. Or worse.

54:03.691 --> 54:07.428
Worse? Did you say, worse?

54:07.995 --> 54:10.831
Now, what could be worse?
I have to hear you say it.

54:10.965 --> 54:13.434
- You know. I'm not gonna say it.
- Oh, come on.

54:13.768 --> 54:15.036
C-U-N-T. Come on. Please.

54:15.169 --> 54:18.105
- I don't think so.
- Please. It'll free you. Try it.

54:18.239 --> 54:20.441
There's a policeman
within the sound of my voice.

54:20.775 --> 54:22.343
- Give him a thrill.
- I don't think so.

54:22.476 --> 54:24.478
- I'm gonna wet you.
- No. You're such a baby.

54:24.812 --> 54:26.414
- Okay. Come on.
- All right.

54:26.747 --> 54:28.783
Cunt.

54:28.916 --> 54:30.785
- What?
- I said it.

54:30.918 --> 54:33.054
You breathed it. I wanna hear you say it.

54:33.187 --> 54:36.324
All right. All right. All right. C-U-N-T. Cunt.

54:36.457 --> 54:39.193
- Cunt, cunt, cunt.
- Free. Free.

54:39.327 --> 54:41.195
Cunt!

54:41.329 --> 54:43.397
Cunt! Cunt.

54:43.731 --> 54:46.233
Cunt, cunt, cunt.

54:46.367 --> 54:48.135
Dirty mouth.

54:48.836 --> 54:51.339
You're right. I feel...

54:51.472 --> 54:53.207
...I don't know, different.

54:53.341 --> 54:56.010
That's because you're free, Miss Scarlett.
You're free.

54:56.143 --> 54:58.346
Come on.
Let's go get everybody and tell them.

54:58.479 --> 55:02.883
- Cunt, cunt, cunt.
- Cunt, cunt.

55:05.252 --> 55:07.221
That can't be good for the baby.

55:07.355 --> 55:10.891
Well, you know, they'll probably take a break
in the delivery room.

55:11.025 --> 55:12.760
Maybe.

55:15.062 --> 55:16.530
Do you miss it?

55:16.864 --> 55:18.299
What?

55:19.533 --> 55:21.268
Sex.

55:22.536 --> 55:24.372
Yeah, I do.

55:28.476 --> 55:30.511
You know what's weird?

55:32.079 --> 55:36.784
You never know the last time you sleep
with somebody it's the last time.

55:37.351 --> 55:39.053
You're thinking:

55:39.820 --> 55:42.123
"We've got problems. We've got work to do."

55:42.256 --> 55:45.393
But you never think....

55:48.029 --> 55:52.266
And then you break up, and a month later,
you look back and you go:

55:52.400 --> 55:54.368
"Oh, that was it."

55:54.502 --> 55:58.372
That Tuesday or Friday or whatever.

56:00.107 --> 56:05.079
And you wish you'd paid attention.
Because it was the last time.

56:05.212 --> 56:06.914
You know?

56:13.521 --> 56:15.322
Oh, well.

56:16.524 --> 56:19.293
Hey, listen, thanks for my birthday present.

56:19.427 --> 56:22.296
A girl can never have
too many ThighMasters.

56:22.430 --> 56:26.033
- I know. I'm sorry.
- No, no. I love it.

56:27.535 --> 56:30.471
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

56:31.138 --> 56:35.209
Your mail's in the living room.
Good night. I drank too much.

56:35.342 --> 56:37.044
Good night.

58:45.473 --> 58:47.608
So, what's the deal?
Do you like her or what?

58:47.741 --> 58:48.976
Yeah, I do.

58:49.109 --> 58:53.214
And I've been trying, but you know,
she's got that "back off" thing going on.

58:53.347 --> 58:55.749
So I just assumed
that she was one of the girls.

58:57.485 --> 59:01.555
No, she's not that.
She's definitely not one of the girls.

59:01.689 --> 59:03.524
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

59:03.657 --> 59:06.627
- She's shy, you know. Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:06.760 --> 59:10.731
- So I hear you're going with us Saturday?
- I am now.

59:12.433 --> 59:15.669
- We should have a little talk.
- Come on. I'll give you a beer.

59:17.471 --> 59:19.173
Come on.

59:34.355 --> 59:36.790
- You ready? Give me a stick.
- Okay.

59:37.591 --> 59:40.628
All right. One.

59:40.761 --> 59:42.463
Two.

59:42.596 --> 59:44.198
Three.

59:44.665 --> 59:49.136
There you go. Hit it right there.
Higher. Higher.

01:00:08.322 --> 01:00:10.124
Okay.

01:00:56.637 --> 01:00:58.405
You want a drink?

01:01:17.458 --> 01:01:19.126
Hey.

01:01:20.127 --> 01:01:23.430
- You okay?
- Just tired.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.434
She's having a good time.

01:01:28.168 --> 01:01:29.236
Yeah.

01:01:31.572 --> 01:01:33.474
That's good, no?

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:35.242
It's what you wanted.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.646
Yeah.

01:01:43.384 --> 01:01:45.185
Holly?

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:49.723
Hey, babe.

01:01:49.857 --> 01:01:53.427
- Is something the matter?
- No.

01:01:55.396 --> 01:01:58.365
Smells like marijuana out here.

01:01:59.333 --> 01:02:01.502
Clove cigarettes.

01:02:01.902 --> 01:02:04.738
You know that's not good for the baby.

01:02:04.872 --> 01:02:08.475
Well, having him come out that tiny hole
is not good for me either.

01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:11.378
So we're even.

01:02:11.512 --> 01:02:13.580
What is wrong?

01:02:13.714 --> 01:02:16.517
I got things on my mind.

01:02:19.553 --> 01:02:21.555
It's that guy, right?

01:02:22.456 --> 01:02:23.891
Nick?

01:02:25.192 --> 01:02:27.361
Who told you about him?

01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:30.964
Well, it had to be someone.

01:02:31.632 --> 01:02:36.236
And besides,
you keep calling out "Nick" in bed.

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.472
I do?

01:02:39.406 --> 01:02:42.676
Well, maybe it's something
that sounds like "Nick."

01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.446
Does he know about the baby?

01:02:46.947 --> 01:02:50.918
You know, I'm only here temporarily.

01:02:51.251 --> 01:02:53.987
- I might go back.
- I know that.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:56.790
And I will not stand in your way.

01:02:56.924 --> 01:03:00.527
But if he loves you so much...

01:03:00.861 --> 01:03:02.996
...why doesn't he call?

01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:06.900
Maybe he can't get to a phone.

01:03:09.737 --> 01:03:12.306
Come on back to the party.

01:03:12.439 --> 01:03:15.676
I wanna get one dance before we go.

01:03:15.809 --> 01:03:17.811
All right.

01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:08.862
No, stop.

01:04:08.996 --> 01:04:11.465
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:13.834
- You don't like it?
- No, I do.

01:04:13.967 --> 01:04:17.004
- I do like it.
- Yeah. So do I.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.512
Feel me too. Put your hands on me.

01:04:25.646 --> 01:04:27.347
- Feel me.
- It's been a long time.

01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:29.817
Yeah. Me too.

01:04:31.752 --> 01:04:34.054
Go slow. Slow.

01:04:34.388 --> 01:04:36.323
Real slow.

01:04:40.828 --> 01:04:43.997
- Wait.
- What's the matter?

01:04:45.532 --> 01:04:47.634
I'm a little drunk.

01:05:01.915 --> 01:05:03.483
You are so beautiful.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.553
No, I'm not.

01:05:06.687 --> 01:05:09.523
Oh, yes, you are.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:12.626
You are so fucking beautiful.

01:05:14.361 --> 01:05:16.530
You taste so good.

01:05:50.797 --> 01:05:52.566
- Alex.
- Talk to me.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.434
- Tell me what you like.
- Listen....

01:05:54.568 --> 01:05:58.105
- I wanna make you come so hard.
- I gotta.... I have to tell you something.

01:05:58.438 --> 01:06:00.073
Yeah, I know.

01:06:00.641 --> 01:06:02.442
You need to know something.

01:06:02.576 --> 01:06:04.845
It's okay. I know. I'm gonna use something.

01:06:04.978 --> 01:06:06.079
What?

01:06:06.413 --> 01:06:10.083
I'm gonna use something. It's okay.
We'll be safe. Don't worry about it.

01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:11.919
About what?

01:06:13.086 --> 01:06:14.988
Come on. It's okay.

01:06:15.122 --> 01:06:18.058
No. No, you don't understand.

01:06:18.191 --> 01:06:19.893
I'm...

01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:23.664
...positive. I tested positive.

01:06:23.797 --> 01:06:27.134
I know. I just don't wanna talk about it.
Because I already know.

01:06:27.467 --> 01:06:29.536
Jeez.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:38.111
What? What's the matter?

01:06:40.047 --> 01:06:43.116
- Who told you?
- Nobody told me. Come on.

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.620
Jesus. You knew. She told you.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.090
Yeah, she told me.

01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:52.159
Why?

01:06:52.492 --> 01:06:54.895
It was no big deal.

01:06:55.028 --> 01:06:59.800
She said you were shy and had a bad time
with some guy, and I guessed...

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:01.568
...and she didn't deny it.

01:07:01.702 --> 01:07:05.038
But it came out real casual,
like it's just part of your history.

01:07:05.172 --> 01:07:07.874
Like, "Hey, she's on the rebound. Be careful,"
you know.

01:07:08.008 --> 01:07:10.978
Come on, it's just, like, a detail.

01:07:12.679 --> 01:07:14.848
What does that make you?

01:07:14.982 --> 01:07:19.252
Big hero, bringing sex to the unfuckable?

01:07:19.586 --> 01:07:23.557
- You must feel really good about yourself.
- Oh, God.

01:07:27.027 --> 01:07:28.996
That's not it.

01:07:31.598 --> 01:07:34.601
I just want things the way they used to be.

01:07:34.735 --> 01:07:35.969
You know?

01:07:36.837 --> 01:07:39.773
I wanna meet someone. Someone I like.

01:07:39.906 --> 01:07:43.543
Get drunk, have a good time
and fuck my brains out.

01:07:43.944 --> 01:07:46.179
Why can't we do that anymore?

01:07:46.513 --> 01:07:48.682
Because you can't.

01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:52.552
That's all. You just can't.

01:07:54.688 --> 01:07:57.024
I think you should go home.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:03.930
- No....
- No, please don't make me beg. Just go.

01:08:32.559 --> 01:08:34.928
Hey. Good morning.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.698
- How's it going?
- Great.

01:08:39.832 --> 01:08:41.902
How was last night?

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.136
It was good.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:45.572
Good.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.642
- Is Alex still here?
- No, he's gone.

01:08:49.009 --> 01:08:50.810
So you had a good time?

01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:54.848
Real good till I found out
you told him I've got HIV.

01:08:56.783 --> 01:09:00.720
- Well, I didn't exactly tell him, you know.
- No, I know. He guessed.

01:09:00.854 --> 01:09:04.323
"She looks like the kind of girl
that tested positive for the AIDS virus.

01:09:04.658 --> 01:09:07.594
I don't know, she's got that kind of glow."

01:09:09.162 --> 01:09:13.033
- It slipped out.
- What were you doing, setting me up like that?

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:15.335
I thought it was a good thing. You like him.

01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:17.770
- He likes you.
- Yeah, great.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:21.174
Maybe he'll ask me to go steady.
Maybe he'll take me to the prom.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:25.812
- Come on.
- What do you think I am, stupid?

01:09:25.946 --> 01:09:28.381
No. I don't think that at all.

01:09:29.116 --> 01:09:31.952
You think you can just put a man in my bed
and I'll forget?

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.888
All it does--
If you wanna know, all it does is remind me.

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:39.292
Alex and you and Holly and her baby.
Every living thing I see reminds me.

01:09:39.626 --> 01:09:40.961
So, what are you gonna do?

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:44.363
You gonna hide out in the house?
You gonna lock yourself away? Come on.

01:09:44.698 --> 01:09:47.634
You don't know anything about it.
It's none of your business.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:51.171
You're the one that's in love
with somebody you can never have.

01:09:56.676 --> 01:10:00.680
Do me a favor. I'll stay out of your love life,
and you stay out of mine.

01:10:00.814 --> 01:10:01.848
Not just my love life.

01:10:01.982 --> 01:10:04.818
- My life. Stay out of my life.
- Meaning what?

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:08.388
That means maybe this isn't working.
Maybe you should move.

01:10:14.027 --> 01:10:15.662
Okay.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.932
Take the fucking piano.
If you don't, I'll leave it out in the rain.

01:10:19.065 --> 01:10:22.936
- I swear to God I will.
- All right.

01:10:25.772 --> 01:10:28.942
All the way back across the room.
Against that wall.

01:10:29.075 --> 01:10:30.410
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:30.744 --> 01:10:33.847
How are you?
Gonna teach me to play piano?

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:38.151
- Is this gonna be good?
- That's fine. Don't scratch that, please.

01:10:47.294 --> 01:10:49.062
Hey, babe?

01:10:49.196 --> 01:10:50.997
Yeah?

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.268
Marry me.

01:10:58.772 --> 01:11:02.042
- Get serious.
- I am serious.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:04.811
Get out of town.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.415
Look.

01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:12.919
- Freeze, sucker.
- I got you.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.922
I'll get you.

01:11:17.958 --> 01:11:20.026
- Stop, stop.
- Marry me.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.895
Marry me tomorrow.

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.333
I can't marry you, Abe.

01:11:29.436 --> 01:11:32.339
You're not over him yet, are you?

01:11:34.407 --> 01:11:37.877
Well, we're all over him.

01:11:38.445 --> 01:11:41.881
Like, six feet over him.

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:11.111
Mom?

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:14.180
It was an accident. Or self-defense.

01:12:14.314 --> 01:12:18.518
I mean, I would never kill anybody on purpose,
or, like, in cold blood.

01:12:18.852 --> 01:12:21.321
Hey, did you ever see that movie?

01:12:28.228 --> 01:12:30.997
Let's get some rest, okay?

01:12:36.002 --> 01:12:39.272
You don't wanna marry me now, do you?

01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:45.245
We're together now. We're together.

01:12:46.546 --> 01:12:49.115
And that's not changing.

01:12:53.353 --> 01:12:55.422
She looks so thin.

01:12:57.424 --> 01:13:00.960
Look at you, honey.

01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:04.230
They gave us a terrible map at Hertz.

01:13:04.364 --> 01:13:07.901
I have been driving around
for an hour and a half.

01:13:08.034 --> 01:13:09.903
Is this your house?

01:13:10.036 --> 01:13:14.474
Isn't it quaint?
I need to use the little girls' room, darling.

01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:16.076
- Oh, sure, Mom.
- This heat.

01:13:16.209 --> 01:13:18.912
And the a.c. is NG, right, Jer?

01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:21.147
You know me. I like it so you need a sweater.

01:13:21.281 --> 01:13:23.149
It's two days. It'll be fine.

01:13:23.283 --> 01:13:25.485
- Hi, I'm Jerry.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry. Robin.

01:13:25.618 --> 01:13:27.954
- My daughter, Robin.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:13:28.088 --> 01:13:30.256
I could've picked you up.
You didn't need a car.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.360
Well, you know me.
I'm so damned independent.

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:36.229
Riding in other people's cars? Forget it.

01:13:36.363 --> 01:13:39.366
Well, isn't this nice?

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.901
Oh, look, Jer, a cactus flower.

01:13:42.035 --> 01:13:44.237
They bloom once every hundred years.

01:13:44.371 --> 01:13:48.942
Quick, show me the potty, darling.
I'm about to burst.

01:13:49.075 --> 01:13:53.480
Anyway, Jane called me at work.
Wants to know how you are.

01:13:53.613 --> 01:13:55.548
- I'm fine.
- Who's Jane?

01:13:55.882 --> 01:13:58.251
Jane used to live here
up until a few days ago.

01:13:58.385 --> 01:14:00.387
Stay out of this. It's between me and Jane.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.057
Well, she asked for my advice,
so I told her she's antilesbian.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.126
- Am not.
- Who's a lesbian?

01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:08.061
Jane is.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:11.231
- And she was living here?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:14.634
- I'm not antilesbian.
- Not you. Her.

01:14:14.968 --> 01:14:16.035
- Who?
- Jane.

01:14:16.169 --> 01:14:18.638
This is her old problem.
She creates this situation...

01:14:18.972 --> 01:14:22.008
...where she gets this rejection
that everyone sees coming.

01:14:22.142 --> 01:14:24.544
- She just wasn't being honest.
- It's a black thing too.

01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:27.680
- Jane is black?
- Yes, ma'am. She sure is.

01:14:28.014 --> 01:14:29.649
You can't live a lie. You just can't.

01:14:29.983 --> 01:14:33.153
Well, there's lying
and then there's just not telling.

01:14:33.286 --> 01:14:37.090
- Big diff.
- She's a black lesbian?

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:41.594
- Yes, ma'am, that is right.
- And she was living here?

01:14:41.928 --> 01:14:44.964
- With you?
- No, no, no, she was just living here.

01:14:45.098 --> 01:14:47.267
They weren't, like, fucking or anything.

01:14:50.637 --> 01:14:52.972
- Were you?
- Were you?

01:14:53.106 --> 01:14:54.941
Were you?

01:14:57.477 --> 01:14:59.679
I'll get the coffee.

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.949
I have to get going, babe.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:05.618
Why? Your shift doesn't start till 10:30.

01:15:05.952 --> 01:15:08.555
Don't you wanna go upstairs for a while?

01:15:08.688 --> 01:15:10.323
No, not tonight.

01:15:10.457 --> 01:15:13.059
- It was nice meeting you, ma'am.
- You going already?

01:15:13.193 --> 01:15:15.728
- We have dessert.
- Yes. Maybe next time. Thank you.

01:15:16.062 --> 01:15:19.032
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

01:15:20.967 --> 01:15:23.036
Maybe I'm just too fat now.

01:15:23.169 --> 01:15:26.539
Don't worry, dear. It's a natural thing.

01:15:28.208 --> 01:15:31.277
Will they live here after they get married?

01:15:31.411 --> 01:15:32.579
Who?

01:15:32.712 --> 01:15:36.516
Holly and, oh, that nice young man.
What is his name?

01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:38.351
Oh, Abe.

01:15:39.219 --> 01:15:41.588
Well, I'm not sure she wants to marry him.

01:15:42.489 --> 01:15:44.557
A pregnant girl?

01:15:44.691 --> 01:15:47.260
Is she crazy? She should grab him.

01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:52.532
Well, it's not really his baby.

01:15:52.665 --> 01:15:54.033
So what?

01:15:55.201 --> 01:15:58.004
She still should grab him.

01:15:59.372 --> 01:16:02.108
Believe me,
I know what she's gonna have to go through.

01:16:02.242 --> 01:16:05.144
You know, I'm a feminist too.

01:16:05.278 --> 01:16:07.480
I was a single mother after your father left.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.250
You think that was easy?

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:14.053
I even voted for Carter twice.

01:16:14.754 --> 01:16:20.293
But you can't fight nature.
God knows you girls keep trying.

01:16:20.426 --> 01:16:22.495
Treating your men like side dishes...

01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:26.032
...you stick a fork in when needed,
just like men used to treat us.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:29.702
Mother, who am I treating?
Do you see a man here anywhere?

01:16:30.036 --> 01:16:32.705
No, I don't.

01:16:33.039 --> 01:16:35.508
And I think it's a problem.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:38.711
I don't understand
why you don't come home.

01:16:39.045 --> 01:16:40.280
I like it here, Mom.

01:16:40.413 --> 01:16:42.415
It's so strange.

01:16:42.549 --> 01:16:45.518
You're not exactly bubbling over
with happiness.

01:16:45.652 --> 01:16:48.421
It's a life, Mom, not a hayride.

01:16:48.555 --> 01:16:51.157
Honey, what is this?

01:16:51.291 --> 01:16:57.130
- Oh, my gosh. The police are here.
- Yes, I see the police, Mother.

01:17:00.833 --> 01:17:03.636
What the fuck is going on?
What the hell is going on?

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:06.239
- Okay.
- Jane, what are you doing here?

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.740
I called her.

01:17:08.074 --> 01:17:10.109
- I thought that she should know.
- Know what?

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:13.580
- He's arresting me.
- What for?

01:17:13.713 --> 01:17:16.683
You know what for, Robin. Pittsburgh.

01:17:16.816 --> 01:17:19.118
- You told him?
- Yes, she told me.

01:17:19.252 --> 01:17:21.254
I take this name seriously.

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:23.656
I cannot tell a lie.

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:25.858
That was Washington, schmuck.

01:17:27.327 --> 01:17:28.528
Whatever.

01:17:28.661 --> 01:17:32.298
Anyway, I'm going to stand by Holly
100 percent.

01:17:32.432 --> 01:17:34.334
But I am sworn to uphold the law.

01:17:34.467 --> 01:17:37.670
And I don't believe I would be any use to her
if I broke my oath.

01:17:37.804 --> 01:17:39.639
Now, would I?

01:17:40.773 --> 01:17:42.442
He really loves me.

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:45.311
Oh, yeah,
I can tell by the manacles on your wrists.

01:17:45.445 --> 01:17:47.413
Right this way, miss.

01:17:49.282 --> 01:17:52.785
Don't say a word, not to him, not to anybody.
We'll get you a lawyer.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.622
I'll miss you guys.

01:18:14.807 --> 01:18:18.177
Now, I promise you
that they are going to treat her right.

01:18:19.245 --> 01:18:22.482
They know that she is going to be
my future wife.

01:18:27.553 --> 01:18:29.255
Son of a bitch.

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:34.460
Honey, what in the world is going on?

01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:38.665
<i>I feel like I've just seen
America's Most Wanted in person.</i>

01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:42.335
- This has got to be the mother.
- Jane, please.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:45.938
- Yes, I am. And who are you?
- I'm the lesbo.

01:18:46.272 --> 01:18:48.641
I used to live here
till your daughter threw me out.

01:18:48.775 --> 01:18:49.909
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Mother.

01:18:50.243 --> 01:18:53.446
Yeah, me too.
But I think this makes her real happy...

01:18:53.579 --> 01:18:56.282
...because now she's got the house
all to herself.

01:18:56.416 --> 01:18:58.651
Cut it out. You're just being mean.

01:18:58.785 --> 01:19:00.186
Jane. Stop.

01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:04.857
- You know, she's gonna need our help.
- No, not our help.

01:19:05.191 --> 01:19:06.592
I'll take care of this myself.

01:19:06.726 --> 01:19:08.361
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.597
Fine, fine, fine.

01:19:12.799 --> 01:19:15.268
- They do that now, don't they?
- What?

01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:18.271
- Call themselves lesbos.
- Oh, Mom.

01:19:18.404 --> 01:19:20.940
And she makes it sound like a compliment.

01:19:22.775 --> 01:19:24.243
She wants to confess.

01:19:24.377 --> 01:19:27.447
She says she doesn't wanna bring her child
into a world of lies.

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.716
You have nothing to worry about, Henry.

01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:32.552
Holly promised me
she is going to keep her mouth shut...

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:34.854
...as long as she does not have to lie
out loud.

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:37.890
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,
you brownnosing putz.

01:19:38.224 --> 01:19:40.760
- I took an oath, Jane.
- Yeah, you took a fucking oath.

01:19:40.893 --> 01:19:44.263
Now we're stuck in Pittsburgh,
Holly's on trial because of your oath.

01:19:44.397 --> 01:19:46.466
- So, what exactly do they have?
- Nothing.

01:19:46.599 --> 01:19:49.302
Except for Abe's testimony,
and that's just hearsay.

01:19:49.435 --> 01:19:50.570
That is the truth.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:55.374
Oh, shut up. Nobody wants to hear the truth.
But aside from that, what do they have?

01:19:55.508 --> 01:19:57.643
They have the Polaroid.

01:19:59.645 --> 01:20:01.948
- The Polaroid?
- Yes.

01:20:02.281 --> 01:20:04.684
I mentioned that I had seen a snapshot.

01:20:04.817 --> 01:20:08.721
It's on the list of exhibits. But come on.
What the hell can they do with that?

01:20:09.355 --> 01:20:11.023
Cold-blooded?

01:20:11.357 --> 01:20:12.959
Cruel?

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.595
Inhuman?

01:20:15.928 --> 01:20:18.931
What words would you use to describe
the woman who posed...

01:20:19.265 --> 01:20:20.566
...and took this photograph?

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.735
This is a photograph...

01:20:22.869 --> 01:20:25.905
...of a man who in a few short hours
will be dead...

01:20:26.038 --> 01:20:30.042
...from wounds inflicted by this woman
that you see before you.

01:20:30.376 --> 01:20:34.647
And not surprisingly, everything that you say
tends to exonerate your friend.

01:20:35.381 --> 01:20:38.818
- Sorry. It's the truth.
- Not coincidentally, it tends to exonerate you.

01:20:38.951 --> 01:20:41.521
- There are no charges against me.
- Yet.

01:20:41.654 --> 01:20:43.556
Oh, come on. Your Honor.

01:20:43.689 --> 01:20:46.559
Is he allowed to just intimidate me like this?

01:20:46.692 --> 01:20:48.561
Mr. Massarelli, please.

01:20:48.694 --> 01:20:50.930
I apologize, Your Honor.
It was unintentional.

01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:55.368
What is the nature of your friendship
with Holly Pulchik?

01:20:55.501 --> 01:20:58.971
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. Let me rephrase the question.

01:20:59.305 --> 01:21:03.910
- How would you characterize your friendship?
- I would call her my friend.

01:21:06.979 --> 01:21:10.817
- Come on. What is this "friendship" stuff?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:13.686
Let me put this delicately
to avoid offending the court.

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:17.490
Is there a romantic character
to your friendship?

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:18.958
- Objection.
- Overruled.

01:21:19.091 --> 01:21:21.828
- You may proceed, Mr. Massarelli.
- Thank you.

01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:23.996
To repeat, Ms. Deluca...

01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:27.667
...is there a romantic character
to your friendship with the defendant?

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.536
- No, Mr. Maserati, there is not.
- Massarelli.

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:32.538
Oh, sorry. Unintentional.

01:21:32.672 --> 01:21:36.042
You are one of these gay women we read about.
Or do you prefer "lesbians"?

01:21:36.375 --> 01:21:38.010
- Do I prefer them to you?
- Are you gay?

01:21:38.344 --> 01:21:39.545
- Do I look gay?
- Your Honor.

01:21:39.679 --> 01:21:43.583
- Please answer the question.
- Are you gay?

01:21:44.383 --> 01:21:45.885
Yes, I am.

01:21:46.018 --> 01:21:48.888
And I'm sure you hear that from women
all the time.

01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:51.891
But in my case, it happens to be true.

01:21:52.525 --> 01:21:56.629
She's scared shitless,
just like I would be after today.

01:21:56.762 --> 01:21:58.998
No, I don't want you to do that, Anna.

01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:04.637
Okay? I don't want you to do that.
I'll call you tonight. All right? Bye.

01:22:06.772 --> 01:22:08.708
Schmuck.

01:22:09.108 --> 01:22:10.142
You did your best.

01:22:10.476 --> 01:22:13.045
Yeah, I did.
Which is more than I can say for you.

01:22:13.379 --> 01:22:15.781
Justice is hard.

01:22:15.915 --> 01:22:17.717
Justice?

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:19.652
You call this justice?

01:22:19.785 --> 01:22:22.588
This girl protects herself
against some marauding asshole...

01:22:22.722 --> 01:22:25.491
...who uses her as a punching bag,
and she's going to jail.

01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:28.160
You call that justice? Is that what you want?

01:22:28.494 --> 01:22:30.930
I want Holly to be my wife.

01:22:31.797 --> 01:22:35.635
- I want us to be a family.
- Where? In the joint?

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.905
I don't know that.

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:41.908
But I do know that there's no kind of family
without the law.

01:22:42.041 --> 01:22:43.542
None whatsoever.

01:22:43.676 --> 01:22:48.714
Because the law that governs the society
is the same law that holds the family together.

01:22:48.848 --> 01:22:52.018
Where'd you read that?
On the side of a Cheerios box?

01:22:57.156 --> 01:22:59.859
You think I love her less now.

01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:03.963
But I don't.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.769
I love her more.

01:23:10.469 --> 01:23:13.105
That is why I had to do this.

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:20.146
Come on.

01:23:21.047 --> 01:23:23.215
Come on, come on.

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.064
- And they lived happily ever after.
- Did I wake you?

01:23:38.197 --> 01:23:42.234
No. I was just looking for a drink.

01:23:43.502 --> 01:23:46.038
- There's beer.
- No.

01:23:46.172 --> 01:23:50.876
I had some bourbon from the plane,
but I seem to have finished it.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.112
What are you doing?

01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:59.952
I thought somehow if I made this trip again,
we'd all be here at the end like this.

01:24:00.086 --> 01:24:04.790
Oh, honey.
Nobody was happy in these pictures.

01:24:04.924 --> 01:24:06.993
Except maybe you.

01:24:07.727 --> 01:24:10.663
Tommy was already so frail.

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.131
And your father....

01:24:13.566 --> 01:24:15.134
Well, you loved him, didn't you?

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:17.970
Yes, I did.

01:24:19.071 --> 01:24:21.173
With all my heart.

01:24:21.707 --> 01:24:23.275
But I lost him.

01:24:23.609 --> 01:24:25.611
And Tommy too. And that's that.

01:24:25.745 --> 01:24:29.582
You just have to let it go, Robin.
Just let it go.

01:24:29.715 --> 01:24:33.819
- I can't.
- You have to, darling.

01:24:33.953 --> 01:24:37.056
Because it's never gonna come out
any differently.

01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:39.892
No matter how many times
you make this trip.

01:24:40.026 --> 01:24:41.761
I know that.

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:46.265
When we lost Tommy...

01:24:47.767 --> 01:24:51.103
...well, your father just couldn't live with that.

01:24:53.105 --> 01:24:55.307
I don't blame him.

01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:59.612
It's not right, losing your children.

01:25:01.113 --> 01:25:04.150
Children are supposed to live after you.

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.952
Oh, honey.

01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:10.656
Are you crying? Oh, my gosh.

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:14.660
Do you know
I don't ever remember you crying?

01:25:15.728 --> 01:25:18.197
Even when you were a baby.

01:25:19.165 --> 01:25:20.566
Isn't that funny?

01:25:26.138 --> 01:25:28.007
I'm sorry.

01:25:32.078 --> 01:25:34.880
I know you're not well, darling.

01:25:36.015 --> 01:25:39.785
I don't know what it is,
and I don't wanna know.

01:25:40.119 --> 01:25:41.787
But I know you'll get better.

01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:44.890
You were always the strong one.

01:25:45.024 --> 01:25:47.359
I can't lose you.

01:25:48.227 --> 01:25:50.796
I can't just lose everybody.

01:25:52.665 --> 01:25:55.267
I do the best I can.

01:25:55.835 --> 01:25:58.204
I know it's not enough.

01:25:58.337 --> 01:25:59.738
And I'm sorry.

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:03.375
But that's what you get in life, you know?

01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:06.011
You get whoever you end up with.

01:26:06.145 --> 01:26:09.748
Whoever is willing to stick by you
and fight for you...

01:26:09.882 --> 01:26:12.351
...when everyone else is gone.

01:26:12.885 --> 01:26:19.058
And it ain't always who you expect,
but you just have to make do.

01:26:20.326 --> 01:26:22.161
I'm not complaining, Mom.

01:26:23.162 --> 01:26:26.699
"Never complain. Never explain."

01:26:26.832 --> 01:26:28.667
Katharine Hepburn.

01:26:28.801 --> 01:26:32.037
<i>She said that in Redbook last month.</i>

01:26:32.171 --> 01:26:34.807
It's a good motto, isn't it?

01:26:36.642 --> 01:26:39.278
Best I can do is pretend
like you never testified.

01:26:39.411 --> 01:26:42.748
- Just go on like it never happened.
- Go on to what?

01:26:42.882 --> 01:26:46.085
Honestly, I don't know.

01:26:56.862 --> 01:26:59.131
All right, this is the situation.

01:26:59.265 --> 01:27:02.768
I am still angry,
I do not forgive you for anything...

01:27:02.902 --> 01:27:04.970
...and I don't wanna talk about it.

01:27:05.104 --> 01:27:06.138
Anna filled me in.

01:27:06.272 --> 01:27:09.775
She told me everything I needed to know
about the trial so far.

01:27:09.909 --> 01:27:11.410
And I know I can help.

01:27:11.744 --> 01:27:15.080
Because even if I can't,
I couldn't make it any worse.

01:27:15.214 --> 01:27:18.684
And Holly is as much my responsibility
as anyone else's...

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:22.788
...and so are you,
because you are my family and I love you.

01:27:25.391 --> 01:27:28.894
Now, I feel fine.

01:27:29.028 --> 01:27:33.699
My T cells are over a hundred,
and I'm raring to go.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:36.235
So unless you wanna waste time
being stubborn...

01:27:36.368 --> 01:27:40.139
...I suggest we get me on the stand
as soon as possible.

01:28:00.759 --> 01:28:03.762
You expect us to believe
that the defendant...

01:28:03.896 --> 01:28:07.199
...pregnant with this man's child,
would leave him and never look back?

01:28:07.333 --> 01:28:12.071
It was over. He beat her and abused her.
I saw. I saw how he treated her.

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:15.374
But not to call. Not to leave an address
so he could forward her mail.

01:28:15.507 --> 01:28:17.009
And practical reasons aside...

01:28:17.142 --> 01:28:20.446
...let's say she did strike a blow for self-defense.
Let's just assume.

01:28:20.779 --> 01:28:25.084
And she decides to let him stew
in his own juices for a while.

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:27.886
But a couple of hours, a few days later,
she realizes:

01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:33.092
"He's my little baby's daddy.
And you know what? He's not so bad.

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:36.362
Maybe he's got a temper."
But all she knows is she needs him.

01:28:36.495 --> 01:28:41.000
- She needs to call him.
- But it was over between them.

01:28:42.801 --> 01:28:46.338
I know you think a girl like her,
the most important thing in her life is a man.

01:28:46.472 --> 01:28:49.275
But she didn't need him. She had us.

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:52.011
I hardly think
that you're a replacement for a father.

01:28:52.144 --> 01:28:53.946
I don't know what it is...

01:28:55.214 --> 01:28:58.450
...but there's something that goes on
between women.

01:28:59.518 --> 01:29:03.789
You men know that
because it's the same for you.

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:07.059
I'm not saying one sex is better
than the other.

01:29:07.192 --> 01:29:10.229
I'm just saying...

01:29:10.963 --> 01:29:12.331
...like speaks to like.

01:29:13.832 --> 01:29:17.336
Love or whatever doesn't always keep...

01:29:17.469 --> 01:29:20.906
...so you find out what does, if you're lucky.

01:29:23.942 --> 01:29:28.280
Well, thank you for that illuminating view
of the war between the sexes.

01:29:28.414 --> 01:29:32.484
- Are you a lesbian too, Ms. Nickerson?
- No, sir.

01:29:32.818 --> 01:29:34.987
But at times I understand the inclination.

01:29:36.522 --> 01:29:38.524
Suppose there is this bond between women.

01:29:38.857 --> 01:29:40.993
- Suppose men are disposable.
- I didn't say that.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:43.195
If that's the case,
why should we believe you?

01:29:43.328 --> 01:29:46.932
Wouldn't you say anything,
wouldn't you do anything, to keep your sister...

01:29:47.066 --> 01:29:49.401
...keep your bosom buddy,
so to speak, out of jail?

01:29:49.535 --> 01:29:53.472
- I'm under oath. I wouldn't perjure myself.
- I'm glad I don't have to remind you.

01:29:53.605 --> 01:29:56.975
And just for the record...

01:29:58.043 --> 01:30:02.181
...you didn't know until the police told you...

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:04.316
...that this man was dead of his wounds?

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:10.556
If I'm lying, may I be struck down
with some terrible disease.

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:15.461
Okay. All right, good news.

01:30:15.594 --> 01:30:17.262
Got an offer.

01:30:17.396 --> 01:30:20.365
Involuntary manslaughter,
extenuating circumstances.

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:23.936
One to two years. Parole after six months.

01:30:24.069 --> 01:30:29.374
I got you minimum security in Arizona,
two hours from home and good medical care.

01:30:30.442 --> 01:30:33.345
I'd hate to have my baby in jail.

01:30:33.479 --> 01:30:36.181
What are the chances for an acquittal?

01:30:36.315 --> 01:30:40.452
He's dead as a result of her actions.
And juries wanna make someone pay for that.

01:30:40.586 --> 01:30:45.224
She didn't testify in her own defense,
and I don't know how much good you did her.

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:50.629
I mean, my baby will have a mother
who's a convicted felon.

01:30:50.963 --> 01:30:53.365
I don't know. What do you think?

01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:56.068
- Under the circumstances....
- I'd have her....

01:30:56.201 --> 01:31:00.906
I mean Abe.
What do you think about that, babe?

01:31:02.141 --> 01:31:04.643
I think that you should take it.

01:31:04.977 --> 01:31:07.379
And I will keep the baby until you get out.

01:31:07.513 --> 01:31:10.115
- Yeah, but--
- That's what I'll do, then.

01:31:10.249 --> 01:31:13.552
Fine. I'll tell them we'll take it.

01:31:19.491 --> 01:31:21.160
I love you.

01:31:21.293 --> 01:31:23.629
- I gotta get in there with you.
- Do you?

01:31:23.962 --> 01:31:26.331
I want you so much, babe.

01:31:27.699 --> 01:31:29.601
Could we have a minute?

01:31:30.302 --> 01:31:33.472
- Yes.
- Yeah. We'll see you later.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.676
Get in here.

01:31:47.152 --> 01:31:50.322
Babe, I missed you so much.

01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:54.660
Well, so much for the bonds
between women.

01:31:54.993 --> 01:31:58.130
- I love you.
- You can't fight that.

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:00.966
I love you so much.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:04.203
- Your baby's gonna be fine.
- You were pretty good in there.

01:32:04.336 --> 01:32:08.740
Whatever happened to
"Honesty's the best policy"?

01:32:09.074 --> 01:32:11.443
You don't wanna go overboard.

01:32:19.384 --> 01:32:21.687
You know,
I been thinking and thinking about this...

01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.089
...so I wanna say it.

01:32:25.224 --> 01:32:29.628
I am really, really sorry. I truly am.

01:32:29.761 --> 01:32:33.532
Yeah, me too. I get so angry so fast.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.135
It's just....

01:32:40.205 --> 01:32:42.174
It's lonely.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:48.313
Between me and everybody else,
there's all this space all the time.

01:32:48.447 --> 01:32:51.550
And it gets bigger and bigger...

01:32:52.784 --> 01:32:55.320
...and I'm on one side...

01:32:56.154 --> 01:33:01.660
...and I'm screaming, and they're waving.

01:33:03.262 --> 01:33:09.768
And the one person I think I'm holding
is waving too.

01:33:14.072 --> 01:33:16.241
I'm holding you.

01:33:21.413 --> 01:33:25.484
There won't be any more lies between us.

01:33:25.617 --> 01:33:28.520
Not even for my own good.

01:33:29.621 --> 01:33:32.357
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

01:33:33.125 --> 01:33:35.494
- I'm gonna go call Anna. She's--
- Jane.

01:33:35.627 --> 01:33:39.431
Yeah? Yeah? What's the matter?

01:33:39.564 --> 01:33:41.667
What's the matter? Hey. Hey.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.236
Abe. Abe!

01:33:49.741 --> 01:33:52.277
<i>Elaine. Jane.</i>

01:33:52.411 --> 01:33:56.548
<i>Listen, I'm sorry to wake you,
but we're back in Tucson...</i>

01:33:56.682 --> 01:33:59.351
<i>...and she's in the hospital.</i>

01:35:17.195 --> 01:35:19.564
What curse, honey? Who?

01:35:19.698 --> 01:35:21.867
The one on my friend.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:26.238
Remember when I came to see you,
you said there was a curse on a friend of mine?

01:35:27.205 --> 01:35:29.775
It's my friend Robin. She's....

01:35:29.908 --> 01:35:32.944
Look, you know, I don't believe in this stuff.
You know that.

01:35:33.278 --> 01:35:35.313
I thought it couldn't hurt to come see you.

01:35:35.447 --> 01:35:38.683
Oh, Robin. That's the girl with AIDS.

01:35:38.817 --> 01:35:42.921
- Anna's friend.
- She's my friend.

01:35:45.424 --> 01:35:47.426
I see.

01:35:55.867 --> 01:35:58.670
- So can you do it?
- Do what?

01:35:59.371 --> 01:36:01.440
Take the curse off of her.
You said you could.

01:36:02.741 --> 01:36:05.210
It's AIDS, honey.

01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:10.315
I know that, but right now
it's just a lung infection, see?

01:36:11.249 --> 01:36:13.285
I don't want a miracle.

01:36:13.418 --> 01:36:16.321
I just wanna give her a 51-49 shot.

01:36:16.455 --> 01:36:20.325
I mean, look, I brought money.
I could pay you right now.

01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:24.996
Pay when it works.

01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:27.933
I can't promise anything.

01:36:34.573 --> 01:36:36.741
Don't wake her up.

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:39.311
Just doing my job.

01:36:41.446 --> 01:36:43.515
Is that a cold?

01:36:43.648 --> 01:36:46.585
Because she can't afford an infection.
I'll have to mask you.

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:47.719
Are you blind?

01:36:47.853 --> 01:36:50.388
Can't you see she's been crying?
It's her mother.

01:36:50.522 --> 01:36:53.925
People think they're being nice,
but they come in with colds, and it's not--

01:36:54.259 --> 01:36:56.294
It's not a goddamn cold.

01:36:56.428 --> 01:36:59.264
- Don't be such a hoo-hoo.
- And what's a hoo-hoo?

01:36:59.397 --> 01:37:01.600
It's a cunt, dear.

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:03.902
Now, why don't you leave us alone?

01:37:25.924 --> 01:37:27.359
Tommy?

01:37:37.502 --> 01:37:38.770
Hey.

01:37:38.904 --> 01:37:41.072
It's just me.

01:37:46.912 --> 01:37:50.382
- I know.
- Okay.

01:37:51.516 --> 01:37:53.451
Where's Mom?

01:37:54.419 --> 01:37:56.955
She had to go back to the house.

01:37:57.989 --> 01:38:00.091
Will you call her?

01:38:01.326 --> 01:38:02.460
Sure.

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:17.642
Yeah, hi. She's asking for you.

01:38:19.411 --> 01:38:20.979
Bye.

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:27.652
Do you want me to get a doctor?

01:38:31.756 --> 01:38:33.491
No.

01:38:44.603 --> 01:38:48.006
I had a crush on a woman once.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.610
I was 10.

01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:55.146
That's when I had crushes on boys.

01:38:57.649 --> 01:39:00.785
She was a strawberry blond.

01:39:02.921 --> 01:39:05.457
That's what my mom called her.

01:39:06.658 --> 01:39:11.930
She was the babysitter
at a hotel we stayed at...

01:39:12.063 --> 01:39:15.734
...right before my dad went to Vietnam.

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:18.670
She was beautiful.

01:39:18.803 --> 01:39:21.406
Strawberry blond.

01:39:22.173 --> 01:39:25.443
I used to be a strawberry blond too.

01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:35.520
It was me you loved, wasn't it?

01:39:38.123 --> 01:39:39.724
Yeah.

01:39:42.794 --> 01:39:44.796
Still.

01:39:47.499 --> 01:39:49.834
Well, I loved you too.

01:39:57.709 --> 01:40:03.048
I don't want a funeral, but Mom will.

01:40:03.181 --> 01:40:05.784
But it's gotta be here.

01:40:05.917 --> 01:40:09.054
Don't let her take me back to San Diego.

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:20.765
And afterwards you could have a big party
at the house, okay?

01:40:26.571 --> 01:40:28.807
Big party.

01:40:44.522 --> 01:40:46.191
Big party.

01:41:05.877 --> 01:41:08.847
Push, Holly. You can do it.
Push right into it.

01:41:10.582 --> 01:41:12.217
Come on, push, Holly. You can do it.

01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:15.720
- Nice deep breath and push.
- Pulling it down.

01:41:15.854 --> 01:41:19.591
- Perfect, perfect. Come on. You can do it.
- Give us a real good push now.

01:41:19.724 --> 01:41:22.827
- You're almost done.
- The baby's coming.

01:42:12.644 --> 01:42:15.847
I wanted to be here for her, you know,
to help her with the breathing.

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:18.349
Next time.
You ever seen one of these things?

01:42:18.683 --> 01:42:19.717
They're really ugly.

01:42:19.851 --> 01:42:21.786
- Where are they?
- Let's go.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.988
Wait. Whoa, wait a minute. Come on, man.

01:42:30.929 --> 01:42:32.931
{\An8}"Fristad."

01:42:33.064 --> 01:42:35.133
"Mitchell."

01:42:35.834 --> 01:42:36.968
{\An8}"Pulchik."

01:42:47.078 --> 01:42:49.147
Don't look at me.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.224
- I can't wait to see the baby.
- All right!

01:43:00.625 --> 01:43:04.362
- Welcome back.
- We made it. We're back home.

01:43:04.696 --> 01:43:06.631
- Hi.
- Coming through.

01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:11.069
- You look beautiful.
- My baby's baby.

01:43:11.803 --> 01:43:15.240
- You look great.
- Thank you.

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:18.276
Isn't she beautiful?

01:43:18.409 --> 01:43:21.412
Hi, little one. Come here.

01:43:21.746 --> 01:43:23.014
Welcome.

01:43:23.147 --> 01:43:25.650
Welcome, Mary Todd.

01:44:38.723 --> 01:44:41.859
Push it right out of there. Push it out.

01:45:03.448 --> 01:45:07.418
It was rough going there.
But she managed to pull herself through.

01:45:07.752 --> 01:45:11.322
And the next day
the pentamidine kicked in, so....

01:45:11.923 --> 01:45:14.292
What are her T cells now?

01:45:14.425 --> 01:45:19.897
They're about 35. They were under 20 before.

01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:23.334
She doesn't look good.

01:45:24.769 --> 01:45:28.940
She looks great, okay?

01:45:30.308 --> 01:45:34.112
We wanna welcome Holly home
with her new baby and her new husband, Abe.

01:45:35.313 --> 01:45:37.015
Great to have you back.

01:45:39.417 --> 01:45:42.387
We're all glad to be here with our friends.

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:45.556
And I want you right now,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:49.827
...to put your hands together
and give a round of warm applause...

01:45:49.961 --> 01:45:54.899
<i>...to 1983's fourth runner-up
in the Star Search Talent Competition.</i>

01:45:55.033 --> 01:45:58.403
No, no, no, Jane.
It was third runner-up, not fourth.

01:45:58.536 --> 01:45:59.537
I told her.

01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:03.808
Fourth was this terrible
little boy tap dancer with pimples.

01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:07.278
He only got that far because he cheated.
That is the only reason--

01:46:07.412 --> 01:46:09.113
Elaine.

01:46:09.847 --> 01:46:11.249
What?

01:46:11.382 --> 01:46:14.285
- Shut up.
- Jerry.

01:49:34.285 --> 01:49:36.721
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

01:49:37.054 --> 01:49:40.057
Now, you better be back for Christmas.
Mary Todd's expecting you.

01:49:40.191 --> 01:49:41.492
Yeah, I will.

01:49:41.626 --> 01:49:45.029
Call me as soon as you get to L.A.
I wanna know how the audition went.

01:49:45.162 --> 01:49:46.597
Okay, Mom.
