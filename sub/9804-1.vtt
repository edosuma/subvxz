In the middle, you feel like
it's never going to end.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.451
But he was with me.
I was going to make it.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.611
I remember that morning.
Hunter made me a deal.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.808
He'd clean out the basement
if I swam all the way across the lake.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.167
I dove right in.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.129
Our basement was a nightmare.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.691
But it turns out
that gliding along behind me

02:02.840 --> 02:05.844
that's when the last song
on the album came to him.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.644
The first time I brought him here
to show him where I grew up,

02:10.800 --> 02:13.963
he decided that this was where
he wanted to write music,

02:14.120 --> 02:18.122

I don't really know where they came from,

02:38.560 --> 02:41.131
but I was there for that one.

02:41.280 --> 02:45.444
So I hold onto that track
as the one that we wrote together.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.120
Together as it was supposed to be,

02:48.280 --> 02:52.649

Mr. Popular today.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.890
All right.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.768
Do you have any books
on how you write books?

05:06.920 --> 05:10.970
You know, all the rules and grammar,
semicolons and whatnot?

05:11.160 --> 05:16.041
Yes, I would recommend
"The Voyage Out" by Virginia Woolf.

05:16.200 --> 05:20.330
It's on the fiction aisle,
bottom shelf, lilac spine.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.323
I'm ready for my next assignment.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.448
Hannah, don't waste your time, all right?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.170
I'm giving the column
to somebody else this week.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.321
What? Who?

05:29.480 --> 05:32.689
I am done playing the fiddle
to your procrastination dance.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.683
Oh, hey, Upton, no, don't test me today.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.207
I worked all morning. I did.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.691
Give me an interview. Come on.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.842
And make it a good one, hmm?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.844
Esther Greeley. Birthdate number 88.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.923
- Bless her heart.
- Now, 600 words,

05:48.080 --> 05:51.004
and I insist you spend a minimum
amount of time on it.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.089
That "Franklin Journal,"
it's always striving for excellence.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.241
Yeah.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.131
Did my special order come in?
The biographies?

05:57.280 --> 05:58.281
Yes, they did.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.807
I have to be well-versed
in the full spectrum of the genre.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.207
Well, this ought to do it.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.522
That's going to be some good writing.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.205
- Here.
- Give me that.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.361
All right.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.046
You're a man of such loose morals
behind the cash register.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.361
- Thank you.
- You know what?

06:12.520 --> 06:14.648
- Keep that one.
- I don't want that one.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.211
Well, you might.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.681
- Maybe I do.
- You're going to love it.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.241
Hmm. Ooh.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.567
Hey! Hello.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.927
Okay, guys.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.730
Off we go. Come on, come on.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.122
You have two unheard messages.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.281
First message.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.568
Hello, Miss Miles.
It's Andrew McCabe again.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.603
You know, I'm not sure if you're getting
any of these messages,

06:51.800 --> 06:53.962
but I still would like to speak to you
about your late husband.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.043
- I've been studying his work...
- Message erased.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.009
- Next message.
- Come on. There you go.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.764
Well, maybe you'll pick up
one of these days.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.126
So in the meantime, I'll just go ahead and
tell your machine a little bit about myself.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.203
I'm a scholar, writer, associate professor

07:05.400 --> 07:06.447
- at Hofstra University...
- Good boy.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.886
...in pop culture and American studies.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.769
Go! Go! Fetch!

07:14.120 --> 07:17.363
Andrew McCabe.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.931
Let's see.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.441
Professor.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.764
Stalker, possibly. Huh.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.248
Uh-huh. Well, congratulations.
You write for the Internet.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.804
Howdy.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.128
- Hi, Hannah.
- Oh, hi.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.123
You brought a bird.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.567
- Had to evict this little critter.
- Hmm.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.087
- Real little fella.
- Aw.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.844
Thought maybe you'd want to tend to him.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.968
You know, I...

07:51.120 --> 07:52.884
I actually just sat down to do some work.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.644
Well, I'm on my lunch break presently

07:54.800 --> 07:58.407
and I guess I thought a bird in the hand

07:58.560 --> 08:01.848
was worth me in the bush.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.521
Hi, I'm not here.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.966
Leave a message.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.248
Noodle? Noodle, are you there?

08:28.440 --> 08:29.726
- It's Mom.
- Mom!

08:29.880 --> 08:31.006
You're not going to like this, sweetie,

08:31.160 --> 08:33.686
but apparently there's
some tight-jeaned fast-talker

08:33.840 --> 08:38.208
from the Big Apple who showed up in town
today riding some fancy motorcycle.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.044
He's been asking everybody all sorts
of personal questions about Hunter.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.246
No.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.208
So I guess you've got
another muckraking reporter type...

08:44.360 --> 08:46.522
What? Mom? Hey, what? From New York?

08:46.680 --> 08:47.681
Yeah, hi, honey.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.450
I guess he teaches
at Hofstra or something.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.967
Anyway, he's in the Chickadee Suite
at the Mount Blue Motel

08:52.120 --> 08:53.610
in case you want to pay him
a little visit.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.723
No. Okay, Mom. I got to go.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.962
Hofstra? Hello?

09:03.120 --> 09:04.963
Hofstra?

09:05.120 --> 09:06.884
You in?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.849
What is that?

09:17.920 --> 09:19.524
I got it.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.160
Upton!

09:31.320 --> 09:34.642
There's some underhanded,
citified star-humper all up my in grill.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.921
I think he's at the coffee shop.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.209
Will you come with me
and help me crush him, please?

09:39.360 --> 09:41.249
- Crush me?
- What the...?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.765
I could fling you like a Frisbee.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.922
Okay.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.686
- Told you she was a spunky one.
- I love spunky.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.604
Hannah, this is Andrew McCabe.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.250
We were just talking
about some really cool stuff.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.771
- Yes.
- You know, he teaches at...

09:52.920 --> 09:54.206
Hofstra.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.561
- Hofstra.
- That's right, yeah.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.803
You want the restraining order now
or you want to wait for the libel suit?

09:58.960 --> 10:00.200
- Huh?
- Sorry?

10:00.360 --> 10:02.931
You parasites are done running
Hunter through the rumor mill.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.451
- Got that?
- Oh, boy.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.090
Talk about barking up the wrong tree.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.971
If you're talking about magazines,
I agree with you... they're trash.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.282
- No, I'm writing a book.
- He's writing a book.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.487
Traitor.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.290
Look, and everybody that matters
is going to be in it, okay?

10:14.440 --> 10:17.091
But Hunter Miles
could be its heart and soul.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.287
All right.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.522
Well, you're awfully tenacious,
I'll give you that.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.801
Thank you.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.770
But my husband was a person,

10:24.920 --> 10:26.888
a real man.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.328
And every song he ever wrote
and everything he ever touched is mine.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.807
Got that? Mine. The end.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.644
Mine.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.123
This crazy widow routine of yours,
does that work on people?

10:39.320 --> 10:41.084
I mean, it seems a little over the top.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.481
- Sorry. That's too much.
- Yeah.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.404
Sorry. Um, hey, look.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.800
I've got respect fathoms deep

10:46.960 --> 10:49.327
for everything your husband had to say
in those shattering songs, okay?

10:49.480 --> 10:52.245
Those too few so...
where did you get that?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.971
Hey! What are you doing?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.805
Hey! Hey, whoa! Come here!

10:59.960 --> 11:02.645
Hey! Give that back.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.370
Okay, lady, look.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.284
That's not yours to ruin, okay?

11:06.440 --> 11:07.521
Sorry. One second.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.887
Please, will you give me back my book?

11:10.040 --> 11:12.122
Are you... it's like a snow globe in here.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.408
It's... a lot of work
went into this, you know?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.927
Go ahead, sir. Please, please.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.003
Are you kidding me? Who does this?

11:20.440 --> 11:22.841
You make a very lousy first impression.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.087
You know, there are many stages of grief.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.321
Oh, yeah?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.209
Hannah's currently
going through vandalism.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.362
Yeah. Spunky, huh?

11:33.520 --> 11:35.522
Thanks for the warning.

11:35.680 --> 11:39.526
"Lend an open heart to Hunter's words

11:39.680 --> 11:42.570
and you soon recognize
that these were always

11:42.760 --> 11:46.526
wounded impre... impre... imprecations

11:46.720 --> 11:49.121
from some distant remove,

11:49.280 --> 11:53.001
a windswept field of high grass
and dying light,

11:53.160 --> 11:56.482
otherworldly, Elysian."

11:56.640 --> 11:59.211
Ugh. "The man was singing
from transcendence

11:59.400 --> 12:03.325
long before his soul floated
across that deep cold river...

12:05.200 --> 12:08.090
yet he shines with hope.

12:08.240 --> 12:13.087
He pulls you beneath the covers
for a flashlit whisper session...

12:14.400 --> 12:17.051
shining on to who we are,

12:17.200 --> 12:19.089
what we run from...

12:20.200 --> 12:22.248
and who we hope in our hearts to become."

Okay, look, um, I just assumed
after a couple of years...

13:17.440 --> 13:18.965
you might be ready to talk about him.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.329
I misjudged that and I am really sorry.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.801
But your husband means
a lot to me, genuinely.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.041
All right, I'll tell you what.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.883
I'm getting something to eat at the diner

13:30.040 --> 13:32.805

13:36.160 --> 13:37.321

14:00.840 --> 14:03.684
Okay, well, I'm not going
to need that long.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.047
I want to make your husband immortal.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.004
That's a cruel thing to say.

14:08.200 --> 14:12.364
No, no, what's cruel is no matter
how good his music was,

14:12.520 --> 14:15.808
it's getting buried in an avalanche
of cheesy singles.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.844
Someone needs to build a monument
to raise him up above the rubble.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.201
Right, and that's you?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.840
Associate Professor of Truth on your hog?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.844
It's not a hog. It's a cafe racer.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.128
It's European. Come on.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.850
Here. Ahem.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.365
Got a few questions.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.090
Yeah, well, me first.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.166
So this book of yours...

14:38.320 --> 14:40.049
It's not gossip.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.168
It's not reference,
it's not fiction, okay?

14:42.320 --> 14:44.402
But it is wildly romantic.

14:44.560 --> 14:48.324
It's about the chorus of lost voices...
artists, poets, musicians,

14:48.480 --> 14:51.563
all of whom failed to navigate
out of the woods of their youth.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.370
And to understand why,
what I'm trying to do

14:53.520 --> 14:56.091
is deconstruct the edifice
of commodification

14:56.240 --> 14:58.322
that I believe our society
has entombed the creative urge.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.245
I mean, he's like the patron saint
of this whole ethos.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.241
You know what? I'm not that worried.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.926
Nobody's reading this book.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.491
What do you want to know?

15:09.640 --> 15:12.564
Um, yeah.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.444
Okay, so Hunter grew up in Philly.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.244
Yeah? He's a drummer
in a punk band, right?

15:16.400 --> 15:20.687
Suddenly he's singing his heart out on the
edge of the earth with an acoustic guitar.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.650
- How the hell does that happen?
- He loved it up here.

15:23.800 --> 15:24.881
Did he? I mean, I...

15:25.040 --> 15:26.929
he loved you and you're from up here.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.526
All right, yeah.
The whole thing is my fault.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.887
- Can I get that out of the way for you?
- Oh, yeah. Right.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.281
You know what?
I'll take that home for the hounds.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.090
- Are we done?
- No. No, no, no.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.241
You know what?

15:37.400 --> 15:40.449
What I really want to know is,
you know, like...

15:40.600 --> 15:42.409
okay, here is a sensitive soul

15:42.560 --> 15:45.291
who gives us a single,
nearly perfect album

15:45.440 --> 15:47.442
from the woods of Maine, right?

15:47.600 --> 15:51.127
And then before all the tours
and the radio play

15:51.280 --> 15:53.123
the chaos, the corruption...

15:53.280 --> 15:54.645
poof, he's gone.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.086
You know, what happened?

15:56.240 --> 15:59.130
Like, some accident or something?

16:02.280 --> 16:03.645
Yeah.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.721
I'll be right back.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.484
Hey, Hannah, just let me
talk to you, okay?

16:11.640 --> 16:13.244
Okay, McCabe. You got good taste in music.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.688
You got your theories about
consumer blah-blah, but here's the deal.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.968
Any monument that gets built for him,

16:19.160 --> 16:21.640
I'm laying the bricks.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.848
Okay, will you... hold on, all right?

16:24.040 --> 16:26.327
Whoa! Hey, easy.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.131
Look, I just want to say, man, I'm sorry.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.604
I'm terribly sorry you want
to just let him slip away for good.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.168
You know, I hope you get promoted
or rich or on "The View"

16:37.320 --> 16:39.084
or whatever it is that made you
haul yourself up here.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.446
Get off my truck.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.246
You're condemning a genius to obscurity.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.646
Work on this with me.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.325
I am working on it, dickweed.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.682
- I'm writing his biography.
- What?

16:49.840 --> 16:50.841
Wait, hold on. Stop.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.684
- No.
- Roll it down right now, please.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.446
Come on, let's talk about this. Please!

16:55.600 --> 16:57.568
Okay. Fine.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.530
Never mind. Nice meeting you.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.123
She just stonewalled me.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.521
I mean, I don't even know
if I can use him in the book at all.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.886
That sucks, because he would have been
the cornerstone of the whole friggin'...

17:14.040 --> 17:16.441
Look, he wrote one surprising album,

17:16.599 --> 17:19.046
he had a lot of potential,
and it sucks that he died so young.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.567
Yeah, but, honey,
how many stacks of dissertations

17:21.720 --> 17:23.961
have been written about, you know...

17:24.119 --> 17:27.329
I mean, hell, you got Cobain,
Buckley, Arbus.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.887
Elliott Smith, Nick Drake,
David Foster Wallace.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.202
On and on, you know?

17:32.400 --> 17:35.529
Hunter Miles? Uncharted territory.

17:36.880 --> 17:41.408
♪ Walked out on the frozen lake... ♪

17:43.080 --> 17:45.401
Tenure in the bag, man.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.891
No, no, no.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.368
This does not make or break you.
Come downtown with me.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.848
I scout three bands a week that are much
more cutting-edge than Hunter Miles.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.401
I know that, honey,
but that's what's so great about him.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.087
There's nothing cutting-edge about him.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.050
He's timeless. He's...

18:05.240 --> 18:06.526
Oh, well. Hmm?

18:06.680 --> 18:09.604
Hey, to Hunter Miles.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.606
♪ Echo, echo all again ♪

18:21.000 --> 18:24.129

19:00.720 --> 19:02.484
Howdy!

19:18.640 --> 19:21.291
As the space pod zoomed
across the horizon,

19:21.440 --> 19:24.808
the captain roared in his reptilian voice,

19:24.960 --> 19:29.761
"Lizardbot, unleash your snot fire!"

19:29.920 --> 19:31.524
Ha!

19:31.680 --> 19:33.523
Unleash!

19:33.680 --> 19:36.001
Hannah. Hannah Miles.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.525
- I'll come back.
- Get over here.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.286
I didn't know you were a fan
of "The Worm of Gondolak."

19:40.440 --> 19:42.204
Uh, here.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.563
Just read it, please.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.120
It's part of an intro,

19:48.280 --> 19:50.442
and then something like a first chapter,
and then some epilogue.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.763
- It's a start, right?
- Uh-huh.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.564
Um...

20:34.400 --> 20:36.721
Uh, hold...

20:36.920 --> 20:40.242
There's some interesting stuff here.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.049
It's just that I know
what you're capable of.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.090
You know, when you're on,
you're like a fanged wolf

20:47.240 --> 20:49.720
howling from a mountain top.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.568
But this is a toothless piglet
lost in the woods.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.324
Great. Thank you.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.081
Hannah, you're attempting the impossible.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.649
It's okay to ask for help.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.251
Yeah, well, thank you, Upton,

21:12.400 --> 21:14.971
but I'm not going
to drop this in your lap.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.205
Well, you're welcome,
but it's not my lap I'm thinking of.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.125
Never.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.130
Come here.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.163
Huh?

22:20.600 --> 22:22.568
Fiction or autobiography?

22:22.720 --> 22:27.164
Pose or confession, Biggie was
as much defined by as he was killed by

22:27.360 --> 22:28.725
his Ten Crack Commandments.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.325
So I ask you, what does that mean,

22:30.480 --> 22:34.690
to hinge your street cred
on your own mortal evanescence?

22:34.840 --> 22:36.205
That is all.

22:36.360 --> 22:37.521
Oh, and, hey, just to look ahead,

22:37.680 --> 22:40.001
after the break we're going to be
diving into the Kool Herc materials,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.481
so start thinking cultural appropriation,

22:42.640 --> 22:44.051
sampling the break.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.771
Which is not the same thing
as copy-pasting your midterms

22:46.920 --> 22:48.888
from a Wikipedia page, Mr. O'Brien.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.883
Busted.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.724
Oh, Professor.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.724
Oh, nice surprise.
What are you doing here?

22:55.880 --> 22:57.291
I thought you might like some sushi.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.169
Lifesaver. Yes, very much so.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.481
- Yeah, we'll eat over here.
- All right.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.051
Hold on one sec.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.401
Hello?

23:05.560 --> 23:08.484
Hi, it's your uncooperative widow friend.

23:08.640 --> 23:12.690
Well, hello there, Miss Hannah Miles.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.127
- How are you?
- I'm good. How's New York?

23:15.280 --> 23:17.362
Full of too many people, as always?

23:17.520 --> 23:18.567
So here's the thing,

23:18.720 --> 23:21.769
this research or whatever it is
that you're doing on my husband,

23:21.960 --> 23:24.327
I... I don't like it,

23:24.480 --> 23:27.723
and Hunter would have
kicked your ass for so many reasons,

23:27.920 --> 23:33.245
but I also think that he would have
respected your take on the songs.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.209
Well, I'm sorry. Respect me?

23:35.360 --> 23:38.364
The muckraking, star-humping dickweed?

23:38.560 --> 23:40.528
Did I forget any?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.762
I am willing to let go
of my first impressions...

23:42.920 --> 23:45.002
Oh, good, good. Well, then me, too.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.606
Hold on a second here.
Psychotic, ball-busting widow.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.808
Poof. To the wind. Proceed.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.724
You know, you're just the last
in a long line of bloodsuckers

23:51.880 --> 23:52.961
coming here to dig up dirt, so you...

23:53.160 --> 23:54.525
No, no, no.
I'm not digging up a damn thing.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.205
What are you doing?
Are you just calling to screw with me?

23:56.360 --> 23:59.603
No, no, no. I have a proposition.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.125
A proposal.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.124
Have you ever written a biography?

24:05.280 --> 24:07.282
- What?
- Shh. Shh.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.283
Okay, I see what's going on here.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.601
You're just a crazy person.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.610
Yes, apparently, because I think
that you have half a brain,

24:13.800 --> 24:16.246
and I need it...

24:16.400 --> 24:19.370
to help me distill the life
of an incredible person

24:19.560 --> 24:21.244
into a couple dozen thousand words.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.971
But, I mean, I've got a book deal
with Random House.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.281
And a pub date, you know what I mean?

24:25.480 --> 24:26.925
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.406
Well, I got the truth
of his last 10 years.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.164
I'd give you access
to all the fun stuff...

24:35.320 --> 24:37.891
the sheet music and drafts of his lyrics.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.166
Okay, okay. Hold on.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.163
Let's just talk this through
for a second, will ya?

24:41.320 --> 24:43.561
All right, so I write this bio...

24:43.720 --> 24:45.324
We write this bio.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.881
We write it? Like, together?

24:48.040 --> 24:49.849
Okay, I call left side of the keyboard.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.081
We co-author it.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.766
Your name goes on the spine
right under mine.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.684
Okay, Hannah, I have an advance.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.490
Well...

24:57.680 --> 24:59.603
well, Hunter's life insurance
policy wasn't huge,

24:59.760 --> 25:01.330
but, uh...

25:03.040 --> 25:04.326
I could do 40.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.567
- Um...
- Are you kidding me?

25:06.720 --> 25:08.643
- Jack it up, jack it up.
- What do you mean, jack it up?

25:08.800 --> 25:13.369
That's, like, five times my advance, plus
she's giving me the keys to the kingdom.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.363
50. That's all I got.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.361
Okay, look, take your time. Think it over.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.524
I tell you what, Miss Miles.
You just bought yourself a typist.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.170
Yes!

25:25.320 --> 25:26.685
What? Really?

25:26.840 --> 25:31.562
Okay, so I guess that means
that you'd be coming up here.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.564
Uh, yeah, yeah.
We've got spring break coming up.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.046
I have a guest room.

25:36.200 --> 25:40.000
You could stay in the guest room.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.367
Uh, yeah. Yeah, no.
I guess that would work.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.325
Okay, well, I will see you
in vacation land.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.683
- I will bring my swim trunks.
- Ha.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.402
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.806
- Hey.
- Oh, look at these guys.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.200
- Show no fear.
- Look at that.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.203
These are the hounds.
This is Ripken. This is Glover.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.930
Ripken, Glover. Excellent.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.606
Hi, I'm Andrew. Hello.
This is what I smell like.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.921
Yeah, okay. He's not sure.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.445
Okay, we'll take you in here.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.090
- Yeah.
- Come on.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.727
In you go. Bedtime. Bedtime.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.206
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.681
Yeah. You know, it's nice to be
in business with you.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.763
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.450
How were the roads?

26:50.600 --> 26:52.602
Oh, I'm...

26:52.760 --> 26:54.762
unmarked, tractionless,

26:54.960 --> 26:57.611
a waking nightmare of snow blindness.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.290
- You, uh...?
- Yes. No, yeah, please.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.487
That would be helpful.

27:00.680 --> 27:04.760
I mean, don't get me wrong, I find
moonlight as romantic as the next guy,

27:04.920 --> 27:08.766
but kiss my ass if I'm expected
to drive by it.

27:08.920 --> 27:12.327
You city people, you have this whole
"don't mess with me" exoskeleton,

27:12.520 --> 27:15.649
but you're generally just such pussies.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.802
I mean, this will be done by the morning.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.530
- It's just a tease.
- Mm-hmm.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.325
You sure you don't want some tea
or something to help you, uh...?

27:24.480 --> 27:26.881
No, thanks. No, no, no. That's all right.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.491
No, you know what?
Maybe you can just show me

27:28.640 --> 27:30.790
where I'll be warehousing
myself this evening.

27:30.940 --> 27:34.327
And there I shall build
a cocoon of many blankets.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.802
Call my gal, let her know I survived.
She's very worried.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.486
But I will rise again, I'll tell you that.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.961
I'll be ready and raring to dive
into my new job.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.327
At that point, I'll drink your tea.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.847
And by then maybe, just maybe,

27:48.000 --> 27:51.004
I'll have forgiven you
for just calling me a pussy.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.931
All right?

28:04.480 --> 28:07.802
Oh, boy.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.808
Hello there.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.885
You're right. You're right.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.963
You're sleeping. My fault. You got it.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.885
Oh!

28:22.040 --> 28:25.283
Dick move. Dick move.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.848
And you're his enabler.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.004
Ah. Oh, hello.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.731
Hmm. Walk of shame.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.724
So this is where the magic happens, huh?

28:40.880 --> 28:45.208
Uh-huh, if smashing your head
against a screen is magic, then, yes.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.522
Mm. What do you got so far?

28:47.680 --> 28:49.728
You have one of those drawers
in your kitchen

28:49.880 --> 28:54.249
full of unrelated items
like the small appliance manuals,

28:54.400 --> 28:59.087
dead batteries, egg beaters,
how he lost his virginity, his go-to joke,

28:59.240 --> 29:01.925
his theories on why Thursday
was the greatest day,

29:02.080 --> 29:05.766
and everything else that I can't forget
in no apparent order.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.208
"Nothing stinks like a pile
of unpublished writing,"

29:09.360 --> 29:13.081
quoth Silvia Plath
before preheating herself to 350.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.766
Yeah, well, enter the dragon.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.083
So I guess we can start with my notes.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.084
It's kind of like a book
without any verbs.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.089
Yeah, sure, but what about his notes?

29:24.280 --> 29:26.760
You know, did he keep a journal,
song ideas, things like that?

29:26.920 --> 29:28.285
No, it was mostly in his head.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.762
I do have the last interview he did.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.127
Yeah, Hannah, look,
I'm all for diving right in,

29:34.280 --> 29:36.965
but I can't start thinking about
the beginning of the story

29:37.120 --> 29:40.408
without knowing how it... you know.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.886
Right.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.965
He should've been home by then.

29:52.160 --> 29:56.483
His cell kept going to voicemail,
so I thought he must be still up there.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.642
There's no reception up there
on Tumbledown.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.883
It got dark and I drove the roads

30:02.040 --> 30:03.963
looking for him pulled off
with a flat tire

30:04.120 --> 30:08.728
or having hit a deer, worst case scenario.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.805
And then I saw his truck at the trailhead.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.163
And later they went up the mountain

30:19.320 --> 30:23.530
with flashlights and dogs, and...

30:26.840 --> 30:30.049
in the middle of the night,
in a shallow ravine, they found him.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.005
He was rock-climbing?

30:33.160 --> 30:34.924
Hiking.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.170
Had he never been on that trail before?

30:38.320 --> 30:40.322
Nope. He'd done it a hundred times

30:40.520 --> 30:44.002
in the same pair of boots that I got him
our first Christmas in Maine.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.162
You know, sometimes
you make a little mistake,

30:46.360 --> 30:47.850
you bump your knee, get a bruise.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.683
Other times you make a little mistake,
and you fall off the face of a mountain.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.204
I am so sorry.

30:59.880 --> 31:02.724
It's the least interesting thing
about him.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.089
Can we work on his life now?

31:08.720 --> 31:11.371
Yes. Yeah, of course.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.047
But, you know, I really think
I should go up there sometime.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.441
Why? To satisfy your morbid curiosity?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.881
Sure, I mean, maybe my dad
will take you up there.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.044
That is if you get to meet them.
Maybe at Easter or something.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.771
Oh, will they be joining me
in the guest room for spring break?

31:25.920 --> 31:27.490
No, they live in town.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.291
- Hmm.
- They do a big Easter dinner thing.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.920
It's... yeah, don't worry.
You're totally off the hook.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.411
What are you talking about?

31:34.560 --> 31:35.891
I earned my master's in American Studies.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.889
Family gatherings are my bread and butter.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.402

- Uh...
- You know, this thing's out of tune!

33:26.360 --> 33:28.169
Yeah, sat by the fire too long, probably.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.446
Mm-hmm, that'll do it.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.648
Plus, I'm playing it left-handed
and don't know what I'm doing.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.370
- There's that, too.
- Those three things...

33:33.520 --> 33:34.965
- Definitely.
- ...add up to what you're hearing.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.727
I'm going into town
to interview this, uh...

33:38.880 --> 33:40.370
Yeah, I'll be back soon.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.204
Wait, someone that knew Hunter?
I'll come with.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.441
No, no. Not that.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.683
I work freelance for a local paper

33:46.840 --> 33:50.367
and write these little
community portrait things.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.045
That is very sweet.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.328
Okay. I'm late.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.960
Work hard.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.531
Okay.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.205
Mm-hmm.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.367
So tell me what you ate at your birthday.

34:26.520 --> 34:30.081
The Lord's largest whoopee pie

34:30.239 --> 34:32.719
with 88 candles on it,

34:32.920 --> 34:36.129
and I blew out those puppies
all by myself.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.770
Are you going to tell me
what you wished for?

34:37.920 --> 34:41.969
Oh, can't do that, Hannah.

35:00.720 --> 35:04.122
Hey, it's called
investigative journalism, guys.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.090
Okay? Your mom's paying me to do this.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.130
All right?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.287
Go! Go, go, go!

35:13.440 --> 35:15.124
All right? Have fun, all right?

35:21.280 --> 35:25.444
And consider what I said
about Jessie's kid.

35:25.640 --> 35:26.971
Kenny Roy?

35:27.120 --> 35:31.967
Oh, he's one big hunk of man, child.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.283
Keep it in your pants, Esther.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.801
You shush. This is my interview.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.725
Happy birthday, my dear.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.644
Yeah. Hannah?

35:42.800 --> 35:45.610
You want to know what I wished for?

35:45.760 --> 35:46.807
Off the record.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.644
Well, not if it's going
to break the rules.

35:48.800 --> 35:52.168
There are no rules to it, sweetheart.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.927
I wished to keep living in the present,

35:56.080 --> 36:00.483
to die just as happy as I was
at my birthday party,

36:00.640 --> 36:05.521
and to be reincarnated
as my granddaughter's cat.

36:07.320 --> 36:11.484
Next Friday's paper, Esther.
Keep your eyes peeled.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.960
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

37:03.120 --> 37:04.565
Back inside. Back inside!

37:04.720 --> 37:07.246
Oh, no. No, please.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.731
Are you kidding me?

37:08.880 --> 37:10.928
Hey! Guys, guys, guys. Come here!

37:11.120 --> 37:12.531
No, no, no! Ripken! Glover!

37:12.680 --> 37:14.409
Whoa!

37:20.240 --> 37:21.730
Oh, you freezing? You freezing cold?

37:21.920 --> 37:24.161
Oh! Oh, hey! Hey, you're back.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.448
I didn't see... see you get here.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.524
Hey, what's everybody doing out here
in a state of undress?

37:29.720 --> 37:31.404
I'll give you two guesses.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.728
- You didn't...
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yes, I did.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.724
No, I took them on a walk
and locked all the doors by instinct.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.086
Yeah, very primal.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.244
Our Neanderthal cousins
were constantly locking themselves out.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.441
Uh-huh. Yeah.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.568
This is one wet T-shirt contest
I don't want to win.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.484
I'll get a fire going.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.285
Wow. You're still freezing, huh?

37:49.440 --> 37:51.283
Oh, thank you.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.805
Uh-huh. Yeah.

37:52.960 --> 37:55.850
Hunter was prone to the bone chill, too,
if he wasn't wearing his long johns.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.122
I made him wear two pairs
the day we got married.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.727
Hmm. Well, you know,
special occasion and all.

38:01.920 --> 38:05.970
We had a whole spring wedding planned.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.124
Daffodils were just coming up
and days were getting longer,

38:09.280 --> 38:12.284
and a foot of snow the day before
we were supposed to get married

38:12.440 --> 38:14.124
in my parents' backyard.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.124
So Hunter says, "Come on, Buttercup,

38:17.280 --> 38:19.009
put your snowshoes on."

38:19.160 --> 38:22.403
And we clamber up and...

38:23.720 --> 38:25.802
say our vows on top of Bald Mountain.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.560
Hunt said the whole world
was wearing a wedding dress that day.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.246
- Well, the man was a poet.
- Hmm.

38:34.400 --> 38:38.803
I had been made redundant,
so I decided to wear magenta.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.651
Yeah. Plus, you would have been
camouflaged, right?

38:41.800 --> 38:44.451
"Hannah, do you take this man
to be your... wait, Hannah?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.682
Hannah, are you there? I don't see you."

38:48.080 --> 38:50.128
- Oh.
- Hmm.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.806
Hannah? Are you there? I can't see you.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.007
Hannah, you all right?

38:54.160 --> 38:55.650
Oh, hey, Curtis.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.768
What are you, uh... what's going on?

38:57.920 --> 39:01.322
- Whole county's gone black.
- Huh. Right, well, great timing.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.126
Looks like we're going to
have to ride this one out till morning.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.288
God, you are wicked pretty
with your hair...

39:06.440 --> 39:08.522
Jeezum crow, boss!

39:08.680 --> 39:11.365
Who are you, if you don't mind
my barging in?

39:11.520 --> 39:13.363
This is my friend Andrew McCabe.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.522
We were at college together.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.364
He's just...

39:17.520 --> 39:18.601
This is Curtis.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.047
He provides light for western Maine...

39:21.200 --> 39:22.201
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.840
...and single-handedly keeps
the deer population under control.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.331
- Well...
- Oh, yeah?

39:26.480 --> 39:28.608
You make deer condoms, huh?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.006
Kidding.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.044
Speak of the devil.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.487
Got some venison from the deep-freeze.

39:36.680 --> 39:39.286
Looks like I thawed out
a bit more than I could chew.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.244
Curtis, that's sweet.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.204
Here, let me take it from you.
Here. Thank you.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.402
Okay. There we go.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.528
I'll cook it up tonight.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.569
Oh, you want to... you want to stay?

39:52.720 --> 39:54.722
Wha... aw, no.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.724
I... I wouldn't want to interrupt
you and your old friend

39:57.880 --> 40:01.327
catching up on whatever, et cetera.

40:13.240 --> 40:16.847
See, that's the good thing
about being a hunter, Andy,

40:17.000 --> 40:18.843
is that even when
the gatherers are up a creek

40:19.000 --> 40:20.081
because they realize they haven't put away

40:20.240 --> 40:22.447
enough nuts and seeds to last the winter,

40:22.600 --> 40:26.605
a hunter, he can find himself dinner
any day of the week

40:26.760 --> 40:29.411
as long as he can sniff out
the right dung,

40:29.560 --> 40:31.050
keep a steady shot.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.288
Yeah. Oh, boy, I hear you.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.488
Loud and clear. Couldn't agree more.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.120
I don't think I'd get on in the city
without my Glock.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.441
You know, when things get really nasty

40:39.600 --> 40:42.444
and I haven't been able to gather up
enough takeout menus,

40:42.600 --> 40:46.082
I just head up to the park,
blow up a beaver.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.288
See, I'd probably go
for the raccoon first.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.283
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- More white meat.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.010
Yeah, that's a good tip.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.401
Appreciate that.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.562
So, Curt, what do you do for fun up here?

40:58.480 --> 41:01.450
Is it too cold for ice cream?

41:01.640 --> 41:02.687
That's all right, Hannie.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.490
I, uh, ahem...

41:04.640 --> 41:07.450
sure I'll be up licking
the crack of dawn tomorrow.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.924
But it sure was nice meeting
your smart-ass buddy.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.208
And I look forward to our next rendezvous.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.371
Okay.

41:18.640 --> 41:20.005
- Oh, hey.
- Hmm?

41:20.200 --> 41:22.680
Sometime we should, uh...
we should get dinner and a dump.

41:22.840 --> 41:26.640
Mmm! It's very neighborly of you
to check in on me.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.531
I will see you sometime, hmm?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.321
Mm-hmm.

41:42.760 --> 41:43.841
- Oh.
- What?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.240
What? I didn't say anything!

41:45.400 --> 41:46.845
What are you...

41:47.000 --> 41:48.081
what are you talking about?

41:48.240 --> 41:49.571
Aw, come on! No, I... what?

41:49.720 --> 41:52.883
It's very rare for me to get to dine
with the executioned

41:53.040 --> 41:55.122
and its executioner,
that's all I'm saying.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.721
No, you don't know me well enough
to bust my chops.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.211
- Here.
- What?

41:59.360 --> 42:00.566
Here. Come on, get over there,

42:00.720 --> 42:03.803
unless you want to die of cold.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.644
No. No, thank you.

42:05.800 --> 42:07.723
Honestly, I think it's great.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.890
No, seriously, though. I think it's good.

42:11.040 --> 42:14.089
I think it's a good thing for you
to be getting back on that horse.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.447
And that guy... oh, boy.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.568
What a thoroughbred.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.001
Hold on, young lady.

42:21.160 --> 42:24.562
You might be falling in love again.

42:24.720 --> 42:25.801
Good for you.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.611
I've known him since high school

42:28.760 --> 42:33.084
and he's awesome in bed,
and that's all he is.

42:33.240 --> 42:35.925
Wow. Never had any intention of, uh...

42:37.360 --> 42:39.249
hearing you say those words.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.129
There they are.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.929
- Hey.
- Shh!

42:46.120 --> 42:47.565
- But seriously.
- What?

42:47.720 --> 42:49.404
- If I freeze to death...
- Mm-hmm.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.291
I just want you to know this has been
some of the weirdest shit

42:52.440 --> 42:53.521
I've ever dealt with in my life.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.284
You're welcome.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.205
Good night.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.642
No, it... it's actually pretty nice out.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.486
Well, it's Easter, so I assume we'll be
beheading the sacrificial lamb

43:27.640 --> 43:29.802
before dinner, right?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.480
Okay. Wait, hold on one sec.

43:32.640 --> 43:35.041
Look, you know, you really
don't have to do this.

43:35.200 --> 43:36.611
Why don't you just take the truck home

43:36.800 --> 43:39.485
and there's a nice bottle of Macallan
under the kitchen sink.

43:39.640 --> 43:41.085
No, no, no. I'm solid as a rock.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.730
And hungry. This is going to be great.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.644
- Great.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right?

43:44.800 --> 43:47.167
Hey, hon, we're here,
so I should really get rolling.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.084
Mm-hmm.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.287
Yeah.

43:50.480 --> 43:54.007
No, I'm curious what I can discover
from the rest of the flock.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.844
Hello!

43:56.000 --> 43:58.765
- Hi! Happy Easter!
- Hello!

43:58.920 --> 44:00.410
Oh, hey! Holy smokes.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.289
- The gang's all here.
- My favorite sister!

44:02.440 --> 44:03.965
- Hi.
- Hey, get in here.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.891
Hey, you grew a beard, huh? Incoming!

44:07.080 --> 44:10.050
Oh, my God. Where did you get that?

44:10.200 --> 44:12.965
Fresh fruit! Be still, my heart.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.124
Yeah, I caught it, Mom,
in my World Wide Web.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.327
Ah.

44:17.480 --> 44:20.689
Dad, can you do me a favor
and just set another place?

44:20.880 --> 44:22.803
- I brought a friend along.
- What, what?

44:22.960 --> 44:25.008
You couldn't tell me?
I hope I have enough food.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.322
- No, it's fine.
- Everybody pretend to be normal.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.529
You know what?
Better still, just sit her next to me.

44:30.680 --> 44:33.445
Yeah, actually, it's... he's a he.

44:33.600 --> 44:34.931
- Andrew.
- Andrew?

44:35.080 --> 44:37.526
Mm-hmm.

44:37.680 --> 44:42.447
He's a friend of a friend and from LA.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.968
He's doing research
on lakefront property in western Maine.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.969
- He's a contractor.
- Well, where is he?

44:48.160 --> 44:49.969
Is he incredibly thin or something?

44:50.160 --> 44:52.527
- He's in the car on the phone.
- Yeah, that's LA.

44:52.680 --> 44:55.047
So LA. So LA.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.089
- Oh!
- No, Mom, I'll get the door!

44:57.240 --> 44:58.651
I'll get the door.
No, no, I'll get it, I'll get it.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.285
I'll get it. No, no, no. No.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.886
- Oh, hello! Hi!
- I'll get the door.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.691
- Welcome! Come in here.
- Oh, hi!

45:05.840 --> 45:09.049
- Hello. How you doing?
- Oh!

45:09.200 --> 45:11.248
Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Andrew.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.561
Happy Easter.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.165
Uh, no. Not Easter.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.970
Uh, Passover. Both?

45:16.120 --> 45:18.885
Well, I'm Linda, real estate holder
in the state of Maine.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.565
- Great. Great.
- Oh, my God.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.563
Are you really working
all over the holiday?

45:22.720 --> 45:24.131
Isn't your family sore?

45:24.320 --> 45:25.970
What family? No, I'm joining yours.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.400
You didn't hear that?

45:27.560 --> 45:29.244
- It smells great in here.
- Oh!

45:29.400 --> 45:31.562
Well, it's our pleasure having you.

45:31.720 --> 45:33.085
- Nice to be had.
- Whoa!

45:33.240 --> 45:36.210
♪ Cheer, cheers, the gang's all here! ♪

45:36.360 --> 45:39.011
This is my other lovely girl Shannon.

45:39.160 --> 45:41.083
- This is my lovely boy Seth.
- Hey.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.083
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is his special friend Megan.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.402
Come on, guys.
Let the man wipe his boots off.

45:45.560 --> 45:46.766
Bruce Jespersen. Pleasure.

45:46.920 --> 45:47.921
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

45:48.080 --> 45:51.209
Shannon, will you give Andrew
a tour of the place?

45:51.360 --> 45:53.966
But don't take him into my office.
It's very, very messy.

45:54.120 --> 45:57.529
She just says that because she thinks
messy means creative and spontaneous.

45:57.680 --> 45:59.091
- Oh, you're so hilarious.
- Nice meeting you all.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.402
I'll see you after the tour.
All right, Shannon...

46:01.560 --> 46:02.925
How could you not tell us?

46:03.080 --> 46:05.287
You know how overjoyed I am?

46:05.440 --> 46:07.807
- Well, happy Easter.
- How long is he here?

46:07.960 --> 46:11.961
Ooh, ooh, can he come with us
to the Bogars' maple syrup barn party?

46:12.160 --> 46:14.162
Ooh! And what about
Matt Frost's band is playing,

46:14.320 --> 46:15.401
so all of Farmington will be there.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.641
Whoa, whoa, Mom.

46:16.800 --> 46:20.168
Just, you know, get all the joy
that you want out of him tonight,

46:20.320 --> 46:22.402
because after his business is done,
he'll be long gone.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.210
Oh, sweetheart.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.169
Oh, there, there.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.766
This is our wall of shame!

46:28.920 --> 46:30.046
- Yes.
- Yes.

46:30.200 --> 46:33.568
My parents love to frame the best
and worst thing we've ever done.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.371
- Huh.
- Yeah, it's constantly challenging us.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.847
- Yes.
- And up for revision.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.207
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.004
Hannah wrote a book?

46:43.160 --> 46:44.571
Mm-hmm.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.848
Seasonal motifs, poem stuff.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.526
It's a very long title. I can't really...

46:49.680 --> 46:52.684
plus, she has two best prizes
for some reason.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.525
Yes, like she never did anything wrong.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.682
- P-H-frigging-D.
- Mm-hmm.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.365
From Brown.

46:59.520 --> 47:00.851
Couldn't get into Harvard.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.610
- Oh.
- Ha!

47:02.760 --> 47:04.364
And Seth's room is upstairs.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.204
- It's sort of creepy.
- Hmm.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.885
Great, Mom. It's awesome.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.371
All right, look at this.

47:09.520 --> 47:11.682
Right over here, Andrew. This is you.

47:11.840 --> 47:15.049
Who needs more sauce? Everyone good for...

47:15.200 --> 47:17.043
Hello, Doctor.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.725
Andrew, right here. This is you.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.484
- Yeah.
- Mm.

47:20.640 --> 47:23.041
Let's all take our seats.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.281
Here we go.

47:24.480 --> 47:27.370
Smells delicious, Dad.

47:27.520 --> 47:30.490
- Let's join paws for a sec here.
- Ah.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.931
We are grateful today to Mother Nature

47:35.120 --> 47:37.726
and Mother Nurture for
the abundant food on this table

47:37.880 --> 47:41.566
and the not entirely unattractive
family around it.

47:41.720 --> 47:42.767
Amen.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.201
We remember those who are
with us in spirit.

47:45.360 --> 47:50.446
Mm-hmm, and a special welcome
to our new friend Andrew.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.409
- Thank you.
- Well, let's dig in, everybody.

47:52.560 --> 47:53.561
- Enjoy your food.
- All right.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.888
- Great. Here we go!
- Looks amazing.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.931
So, Andrew, what's the inside scoop
on lakefront prices?

48:00.080 --> 48:04.244
You think Maine's going to explode
like the Boston suburbs after the crash?

48:07.640 --> 48:09.449
- Is Maine going to explode?
- Yeah.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.285
I'm such a sucker.
I'm 29 and still renting.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.568
What do you think, Andrew?
You think I should buy?

48:14.720 --> 48:16.927
Or is the market still softening?

48:17.120 --> 48:20.727
You know, actually,
I think Andrew's specialty

48:20.880 --> 48:23.451
is in commercial real estate, right?

48:23.600 --> 48:24.681
Mm-hmm.

48:24.880 --> 48:27.850
And who wants to talk about work
over Easter dinner?

48:28.000 --> 48:29.525
- Oh, I do.
- I was just curious, man.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.409
Me, yeah. I would love to.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.800
Talk about it anytime, you know?

48:32.960 --> 48:35.804
Breakfast, lunch, snack time, dinner.

48:35.960 --> 48:38.440
I mean, I'm a realtor, you know?
It's my passion.

48:39.560 --> 48:42.404
How'd you catch
the real estate bug, Andrew, huh?

48:42.600 --> 48:44.762
Your folks big landholders?

48:44.920 --> 48:46.285
Mmm. Sure. Mm-hmm.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.720
You ever heard of Wyoming?

48:47.880 --> 48:50.645
Okay. All right, all right, all right.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.564
- Kidder.
- Hold your horses.

48:52.720 --> 48:53.801
But I care. I care.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.371
Yeah, she's curious. It's all right.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.806
No, actually, Mom,

48:56.960 --> 49:00.806
Andrew's research
is for more personal reasons.

49:00.960 --> 49:05.170
He's an associate professor for
American Studies at Hofstra University

49:05.320 --> 49:07.800
and he's here researching
a paper about Hunter.

49:12.040 --> 49:15.442
And when I say paper,
I mean more like a biography

49:15.600 --> 49:20.322
that I have hired him to write,
with me, about Hunter.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.687
Oh, really? So there's nothing
going on here, you mean?

49:22.840 --> 49:26.128
- No.
- No, and he ha... not that it matters.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.408
- He has a girlfriend...
- Mm-hmm. Finley.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.244
...and can we not talk about this
while he's sitting right here?

49:30.440 --> 49:33.125
- Well, fuck-a-doodle-doo.
- Ooh.

49:33.320 --> 49:36.324
And here I thought
maybe the clouds were lifting.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.289
You know, Mom, it's not actually
any of your business.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.523
So you're just eating my manicotti
and happily lying to my face?

49:41.680 --> 49:43.045
Oh, jeez.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.084
Okay, I'm sorry.

49:47.240 --> 49:50.323
Can we start again with this, please?

49:50.480 --> 49:54.610
My real name is still Andrew McCabe.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.882
I'm just... I'm just the help.

49:57.040 --> 50:00.806
I wasn't briefed on the classified
nature of my employment.

50:00.960 --> 50:04.931
No, I am really hoping to interview
each and every one of you

50:05.080 --> 50:07.003
if you're willing to contribute

50:07.160 --> 50:10.562
to what I believe will be
a very beautiful book someday.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.484
That is, unless I just got fired.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.250
My food got cold.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.083
Meatball?

50:23.120 --> 50:25.088
Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.083
- There's a spoon in the bowl.
- You're absolutely right.

50:27.240 --> 50:28.321
- No, leave it on.
- No.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.084
- You didn't have to do that.
- Spoon's better way to go.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.129
It's all right.

50:37.920 --> 50:40.924
- Need any help?
- No.

50:42.480 --> 50:47.084
I wanted to thank you for including me
in such a delicious feast, Mrs. Jespersen.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.288
The manicotti was dry.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.244
Well, I gobbled it right up.

50:51.440 --> 50:53.124
You sure did.

50:53.320 --> 50:57.769
Hey, uh, so are you a fan
of Hunter's music?

50:59.000 --> 51:00.445
So what is this?

51:00.600 --> 51:02.443
The interview portion of the program?

51:02.600 --> 51:05.126
Sorry, but I don't support
the whole project.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.441
Gotcha.

51:07.600 --> 51:10.080
Back to Balderdash it is. Not a problem.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.766
No, see, it is.

51:12.960 --> 51:17.522
She will never break this endless cycle
of keeping Hunter around.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.967
Well, you know, maybe this is her way
of ending that chapter of her life.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.407
Oh! No, no, no.

51:22.560 --> 51:25.325
She does care a great deal
about his legacy, you know.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.721
His legacy is 12 songs.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.803
Does the world care that much?

51:29.960 --> 51:31.485
You'd be surprised.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.722
Yeah, and what do you care about, huh?

51:33.880 --> 51:36.486
Is this your golden ticket
to tenure at some school

51:36.640 --> 51:39.405
where there's ivy on the walls?

51:39.560 --> 51:41.801
A fan?

51:41.960 --> 51:43.962
He was my son.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.203
That's what he was to me.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.771
No, of course.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.331
I'm sorry.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.851
Well, what was he like?

51:59.400 --> 52:02.688
It's kind of hard to tell
from just listening to the music.

52:05.320 --> 52:09.405
There was darkness in the man,
but, oh, he was one of a kind.

52:10.520 --> 52:14.764
And she felt lucky
to be considered his equal.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.161
Hannah's a pretty smart cookie herself.

52:17.360 --> 52:19.362
Yeah, you think so? I know so.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.842
But she can't think her way
out of this one.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.365
Uh-unh.

52:26.280 --> 52:28.009
- What is in here?
- Oh, boy.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.690
- Okay.
- Who knows?

52:31.680 --> 52:33.682
- This is heavy.
- All right.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.481
Um, all right. That was... interesting.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.884
Hey, I got a question for you.

52:42.040 --> 52:44.247
No, that wasn't my real mother.

52:45.520 --> 52:47.727
Here.

52:47.880 --> 52:52.363
Your prize for lying to my folks,
not that you were very good at it.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.404
Seriously, though,

52:57.560 --> 52:59.210
why do you want to write this book?

53:03.200 --> 53:07.208
'Cause I had so much love left in my
arsenal and I never got to spend it.

53:08.400 --> 53:09.970
Good night.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.087
- Hey, Hannah?
- Uh-huh?

53:14.240 --> 53:16.811
Kind of dug your family.

53:33.600 --> 53:36.251
Easy, Carl Lewis. What are you doing?

53:36.440 --> 53:38.249
Holy smokes.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.208
- Watch the ice here.
- What ice?

53:45.360 --> 53:47.442
I'm kidding, Bruce. These are jokes.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.048
I thought you invited me over
for French toast.

53:54.200 --> 53:55.440
What's with the bag o' peat?

53:55.600 --> 53:58.807
I thought as long as the boys are having
their fun, we could be productive.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.126
Okay.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.248
You got to plant the seeds early, honey.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.164
Try thinking more about the future.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.606
Thank you.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.444
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- There you go.

54:09.640 --> 54:12.644
- Come on.
- Jesus, you're quick.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.290
Oh, boy.

54:14.440 --> 54:16.681
Of all the days I forget
my pedometer, huh?

54:16.840 --> 54:20.643
If we want to reach the pond up top,
we have to get through Fat Man's Misery,

54:20.800 --> 54:23.371
not unlike crawling up a chimney.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.807
You want the best lookout,
we can hit the Lemon Squeeze

54:25.960 --> 54:29.089
while you make like a piece of bologna
between slices of toast.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.965
Or we can stop here,

54:32.160 --> 54:35.209
eat some granola, and pay our respects.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.086
Wait, this is it?

54:40.560 --> 54:42.324
It's where they found him.

54:54.080 --> 54:57.846
Always figured probably on his way down

54:58.000 --> 54:59.843
- it was getting dark.
- Yeah.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.207
He was out on that ridge above you there.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.243
- Yeah.
- Good Lord.

55:04.440 --> 55:05.680
That is no joke.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.525
Got spooked by some animal
jumped out on the trail.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.524
He just lost his footing.

55:15.480 --> 55:16.686
Bruce...

55:18.080 --> 55:19.889
we both know he didn't lose
his footing, right?

55:22.040 --> 55:24.202
Wouldn't you say he was
a pretty tortured guy?

55:26.320 --> 55:28.721
Real question for you here, Andrew.

55:30.880 --> 55:33.360
Who do you think you are?

55:33.520 --> 55:36.205
I've studied guys like him for years.

55:36.360 --> 55:39.330
You know, Hunter is pretty textbook.

55:39.520 --> 55:43.809
If you really, really listen to him...

55:43.960 --> 55:45.883
It's like it hasn't occurred
to anyone, right?

55:46.040 --> 55:48.805
Yeah, it never occurred to us.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.681
So thank you, oh, wise one
from the island of tall buildings,

55:52.840 --> 55:55.889
for teaching us native folk how it is.

56:01.720 --> 56:05.566
Now you just have to nurture them

56:05.720 --> 56:07.802
like they're your own children.

56:07.960 --> 56:11.328
Smooth segue to my ovaries.

56:11.480 --> 56:16.771
Listen, every year presents a milestone.

56:19.080 --> 56:23.768
Knocking out your baby teeth, graduating,

56:23.920 --> 56:25.001
heavy petting.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.242
Ew.

56:27.440 --> 56:31.686
When you're old,
there are only two milestones left...

56:31.840 --> 56:34.411
grandchildren and death,

56:34.560 --> 56:36.767
and you just pray that one
comes before the other.

56:36.920 --> 56:38.763
I know. I know I'm impatient,

56:38.920 --> 56:43.528
but I've tasted all the juicy stuff
except this one thing.

56:44.920 --> 56:47.287
You know, Ma,

56:47.440 --> 56:49.966
I used to think that I wanted children.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.248
Now I just want llamas.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.971
So many llamas.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.122
Just take one step.

56:57.280 --> 57:00.409
Yeah, do a date on the Internet
and cut this hair.

57:00.600 --> 57:01.806
Jesus.

57:01.960 --> 57:04.691
Just take a break from
this morbid writing project.

57:04.840 --> 57:06.649
Wow. Cue the salt in the wound.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.041
Hey, it's time
to call up your old friends,

57:09.200 --> 57:11.089
lipstick and eyeliner.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.486
These are like raw eggplant.

57:12.640 --> 57:15.769
Okay. Three strikes, I'm out.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.160
You need a little perking up.

57:17.320 --> 57:18.731
No, I do not need anything.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.087
Just a little bit. Just a smidge.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.810
You're just going to leave me?

57:27.640 --> 57:29.324
Of course. Of course!

57:29.480 --> 57:31.005
No, it gets dark at 4:00 PM.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.844
Bed time. Who needs coffee?

57:33.000 --> 57:37.130
Like I said, the gatherers
always get screwed.

57:37.280 --> 57:38.361
Howdy, Curt.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.841
You here to discuss the food chain
a little bit more?

57:41.000 --> 57:43.241
- How's it go?
- She's a real Maine girl, that Hannah.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.528
Aw, you're telling me.

57:45.680 --> 57:47.921
She likes a good man.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.161
A real man.

57:49.360 --> 57:51.681
A man that smells like pine resin,

57:51.840 --> 57:55.367
not Pierre Cardin.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.090
I've got no claim on her, Curtis.

57:57.280 --> 58:00.204
Hell, if you guys procreate,
it might even out the gene pool, yeah?

58:00.360 --> 58:02.328
Really nice seeing you.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.528
Oh, my God.
Are we going to do this bullshit?

58:04.680 --> 58:06.125
What are you going to do? Kick my ass?

58:06.280 --> 58:08.362
Not saying that you couldn't.
You'd destroy me.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.443
There's not a soul in this town
that wants to see her

58:10.600 --> 58:12.523
going with a flat-lander like you.

58:12.680 --> 58:15.445
You're going to crawl back
into that exhaust hole you came from.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.728
All right, Curtis. Curtis Brown.

58:17.880 --> 58:20.531
We live in the slow lane,
not a gravel ditch.

58:20.720 --> 58:22.131
Where are your manners?

58:23.360 --> 58:24.521
Andy...

58:24.680 --> 58:26.489
go screw yourself.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.130
Please and thank you.

58:29.640 --> 58:32.723
- Oh!
- Aw, come on.

58:32.880 --> 58:35.406
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine.

58:35.560 --> 58:37.403
Just helping everybody
work through their issues.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.525
He didn't pee on you?

58:40.680 --> 58:43.411
No. Surprisingly, no.
He did not pee on me.

58:43.560 --> 58:45.562
Mm-mm. No, I didn't even know
that would be an option.

58:45.720 --> 58:47.404
No, he just threw down the gauntlet.

58:47.560 --> 58:50.291
Well, that's, uh... that's kind of sweet.

58:50.440 --> 58:52.090
No, it is not sweet.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.844
No. Come on, what are you talking about?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.924
This isn't quaint
or kooky small-town charm.

58:57.080 --> 58:58.411
You know? And I got to be honest with you.

58:58.560 --> 59:01.569
I am sick of the forest and all
the crazy little creatures who live in it.

59:01.760 --> 59:03.091
You drag me up here to write this book...

59:03.240 --> 59:05.607
Okay, Snow White.
Nobody is holding you hostage.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.525
You leave in two days, right?
You can leave tomorrow.

59:08.680 --> 59:10.091
Oh, my God.

59:10.240 --> 59:13.084
Can you just be a chick
for, like, a second,

59:13.240 --> 59:15.607
and say, "There, there, poor thing,"

59:15.760 --> 59:17.569
or some shit, please?

59:17.720 --> 59:19.370
Some shit.

59:19.520 --> 59:20.601
Thank you.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.240
Was that so hard?

59:23.400 --> 59:25.767
Now I don't know about you,
but I would kill

59:25.920 --> 59:29.003
for an overpriced meal
at a mediocre restaurant.

59:29.160 --> 59:32.562
- Shall we?
- Dinner and a dump.

59:32.720 --> 59:36.122
Purely for journalistic reasons,
I will choose dinner and a dump.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.645
- Excellent.
- Got to see what this is all about.

59:37.840 --> 59:38.921
Let's do it.

59:39.080 --> 59:41.003
Ah, there we go.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.764
Hubba bubba. Look at that there.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.285
We have a gusher.

59:45.400 --> 59:47.801
I can't believe we go out to eat
and you order the one thing on the menu

59:47.960 --> 59:49.485
that anyone could make
with their eyes shut.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.802
You know, people who can't
toast Eggos can boil a bug.

59:51.960 --> 59:53.041
What are you talking about?

59:53.200 --> 59:54.725
Someone had to cut
this lemon wedge right here.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.962
They had to melt the butter.
There's a lot of steps involved.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.804
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, man, oh, man.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.291
Look at that.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.807
Are you ever getting the eye from
the woodchucks at the bar over there.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.769
Uh-huh. Hi!

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.490
Me or her?

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.291
You see, around here,
everybody keeps tabs on everyone else,

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.001
and everyone else is pretty sure
I ought to be moving on.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.209
You never thought about moving
to New York? Manhattan?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.044
- No.
- No? Living in the big city?

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.611
A change of scenery might help.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.565
No, it's not the kind of thing
that you can take a vacation from.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.762
It's who I am now.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.844
I mean, you try to seem normal, right?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.004
But here's this thing that looms
so large in your life

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.004
you can't even see around it, you know?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.926
Can't dress yourself because
it's blocking your closet.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.890
I guess you could technically say
that I'm depressed.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.850
No. No, you are not depressed.
That is not depression.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.685
That is just flat-out
certified grief, you know?

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.205
That's normal. That's natural.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.600
And it's not like you're waking up at noon

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.765
or Skyping with your therapist
during office hours

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.486
like me and half my colleagues.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.120
What have you got to be
so depressed about?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.203
- Are you serious? Me?
- Yes.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.886
Tons of stuff. I do!

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.727
I mean, little things, you know,
like having a bunch of smart-ass students

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.360
that don't have a single
original thought in their head.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.723
That's depressing. Big things?

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.202
My dad passing away way too early.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.209
That's tough, you know?

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.721
I mean, the smallest thing
can set me off with that.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.324
You know, like the fall of light through
a window or a stack of old newspapers.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.561
- Mm-hmm.
- It's true, though.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.442
But my old man took his life
when I was a kid.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.568
You know, so...

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.529
Now there, that's a guy
you thought you knew,

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.081
but... surprise.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.771
Do they do free refills on booze here,
or how's that work?

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.202
- That's terrible.
- Mmm.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.840
Yes, it was terrible.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.764
Yeah. But it was a long time ago.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.764
And that's what serotonin reuptake
inhibitors are for anyway, right?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.241
- You're medicated?
- Not currently, no.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.521
But a couple more weeks up here

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.489
and I may have to call my dealer...
er, I mean, doctor.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.647
- Oh.
- What's going on, boss?

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.600
Nothing. Just talking about stuff.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.171
Hannah, care to join me
on the dance floor?

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.451
- Of course.
- Oh.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.125
- Great.
- Yeah.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.486
Go scoot your boots.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.962
Five... five songs?

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.122
Five hours.

I have spent my entire adult life
in the city, okay?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.602
I've sat front row at the Garden.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.366
I've dined at some very hip spots.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.682
I've done seen some crazy shit, okay?

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.763
But this is what Saturday night
is all about.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.921
Mm-hmm.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.690
Yeah.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.366
Well, for some of us it is.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.605
That's great.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.171
It's great.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.051
Isn't it weird, you spend your whole life

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.009
trying not to die some way or other,

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.731
and then when something
really terrible happens,

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.042
you just wish it were you and not them?

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.042
Yeah, well, I'm glad it wasn't you.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.611
Right.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.006
There's no way that he would pay you
40 grand to write my biography.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.889
Pretty sure it was 50 grand.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.963
Don't look at me like that.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.168
Mmm.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.561
Mmm.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.404
Wow.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.891
He's a lot closer now, isn't he?

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.411
- Just stay calm.
- Should we go?

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.722
- Put it in reverse and leave.
- Yeah, that's what I was think... okay.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.208
All right, you got
the full rental insurance, right?

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.486
No, I'm not too worried about it.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.768
I'm sure those scratches
will just buff right out.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.924
Are you done for the night?

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.081
Uh, no. I mean, no, not if you're not.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.605
Okay. Come on.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.081
- Oh, we're getting out.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.446
All right. What were you thinking?

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.125
Tada.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.123
There's more. Come on.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.126
Where the hell are you taking me?

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.850
You'll see.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.526
There may well be a raccoon in here,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.121
so brace yourself.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.802
Here, wait. Let me just get the lights.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.491
- God, it's freezing.
- This is amazing.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.369
- Let me put the heater on.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.204
Whoa. This... I can't believe...

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.328
I mean, this is... this is
what I'm talking about.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.481
Yeah.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.005
This is the guy we all want to know.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.844
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.889
Look at all this.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.481
I can't believe this.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.530
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:09.523
This is incredible.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.887
I...

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.407
Hey, Hannah.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.289
Thank you.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.726
Thank you for letting me in.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.488
I'll erase your brain later.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.687
- Agreed. Agreed.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.683
Yes, absolutely. Yeah.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.371
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.171
- Knock yourself out.
- Yeah?

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.890
Oh, boy.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.206
Oh.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.443
The... yeah.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.963
Analog, of course.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.646
- Wait, wait. These aren't...
- Oh, God, no.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.723
Those babies are in a safety deposit box.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:04.090
That's just an empty blank canvas.

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.402
Yeah. Oh, man.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.402
Yes. Now we're talking.

Hmm.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.242
There's, like, one song.
At least one, or part of one,

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.084
but she definitely knew nothing about it.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.641
- And you don't get to hear it?
- I have no idea.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.848
She could be ripping it
to shreds as we speak.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.571

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.041
What's going on?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.281
Hi!

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.649
Hey! Finley!

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.121
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.282
I hopped on the 6:00 AM to Portland.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.689
Don't know what happened, but somehow
the cab ended up being $248.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.080
Stay, stay!

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.691
I definitely only had money for tip.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.330
- Crazy expensive, Maine.
- Right?

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.801
Yeah. So good to see you. That's...

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.724
- Hannah...
- Hmm?

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.724
...this is Finley,
right here in the flesh.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.565
I'll go grab my wallet
and get cash for you.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.688

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.604
Oh, my gosh, I've heard so much about you.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.000
He adores you.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.400
And as a person in the music industry,

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.484
I just want to say that we all grieved
the sudden loss of your husband.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.450
Aw, you, too. I mean, thank you, I mean.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.170
And sorry to barge in on you like this.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.687
I just didn't know how good you were
at keeping secrets.

01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.525
Oh, terrible.
You shouldn't tell me anything.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.522
Here it is.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.011
Got it.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.083
- All right.
- I'll leave you to, uh...

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.288
Right. Yeah.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.442
- She's cute.
- Huh? Huh?

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.284
Yeah. Oh, no. I guess so, yeah.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.249
I'll be right back.
Bedroom's right up there.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.687
So good to see you.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.523
Not bad, huh?

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.370

for a couple of weeks in the summer?

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.450

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.288
Get in here! Whoa!

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.931
Hey, Finley.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.803
Happy anniversary.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.249
What did you think of the song?

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.011
Um, I don't... what are you talking about?

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.484
You forgot to rewind.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.889
It's all right. I don't blame you.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.485
What did you think of it?

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.724
I thought it was beautiful.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.011
And incredibly sad.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.850
No, not sad.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.161
What do you think I should do with it?

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.527
- You're asking me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.171
No idea.

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.407
Well, if you love somebody,
set them free, right?

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.847
Right.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.047
Sting?

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.005
I think that might have been
the Dalai Lama first

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.524
and then Sting played some incredibly
obscure instrument behind it.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.209
Hannah...

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.484
did he have any idea how lucky he was?

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.770
- He was lucky.
- Yeah.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.241
Until he was profoundly unlucky.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.048
I know how you feel.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.884
All that uncertainty
of how and why you lost him.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.086
What?

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.406
He doesn't deserve this, you know?

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.643
He couldn't bear the weight,
so he put it all on you.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.290
He traded you for some
poetic notion of immortality.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.011
Mmm, no, Andrew, he...

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.243
Hannah, it's all... I mean, those lyrics.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.810
I mean, "Lay me in the snow
where I lose myself to time?

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.928
Is there more than flesh and bone?"

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.162
And then at the end he...
I mean, he just...

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.603
I mean, he tells you he's giving up.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.808
I'm so sorry.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.366
All this time and you've just
been gathering evidence

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.444
for some suicide theory.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.964
That's... no. That's not true.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:05.286
Because, well, whose suicide
are you trying to figure out?

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.646
Oh.

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.363
Oh, great. Oh, okay. Psychoanalysis, hmm?

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.284
Oh, we're going to do a little... okay.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.603
Because those lyrics, if we're honest
about those lyrics, it seems to me...

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.444
Andrew, the song means nothing.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.410
- How can you say that?
- Because I wrote it.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.528
What?

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.808
It's a poem.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.325
It's my little jokey poem

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.326
about making frostbitten love
on top of Little Jackson.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.088
Hunter set it to music for a surprise
or I don't know what.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.802
It... "Lay me in the snow"
doesn't mean "bury me."

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.007
You're the one who's obsessed with death.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.129
My Hunter was obsessed with life.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.642
Go away.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.689
Go upstairs.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.170
Go to New York.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.242
Do you know where Hunter Miles is buried?

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.006
Mm-hmm. Right here.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.605
Thanks.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.162
You ever heard his song "Sweet Spring"?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.529
Wow, right?

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.205
What's your email?

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.522
Uh...

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.728
muffinator66@outlook.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.450
Muffinator.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.840
Why?

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.761
I have a song for you.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.521
Share it around if... if you like it.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.840
Oh!

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:25.202
The truth of the matter is
I raked it in last year.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.486
Kids would much rather hitch a ride
on a four-wheeler than take the bus.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.883
Coolness factor. I charge five bucks.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.201
Marginal profit each ride, but you get
to buzz around Franklin County all day.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.562
Demand's high and chicks dig it.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.051
Feel free to print that.

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.641
Well, thank you for the scoop,
Mr. Woodcock.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.565
You know, Miss Miles,

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.085
I don't just drive around high school
girls, if you, ahem, catch my drift.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.245
All right, Ethan.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.965
Hannah, hear me out.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.646
I did my best to let go,
but I had to write it anyway,

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.969
a couple chapters at least,
and I think we're onto something.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.964
Please forgive me for thinking
brilliance comes with torture,

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.124
but I'm not from your neck of the woods.

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.327
Just read it, please?

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.205
Right now, actually,
because I'm waiting for you

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.129
to walk through the door
at Upton's bookstore.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.481
I'll be reading "Anna Karenina,"

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.530
and if she throws herself under a train
and you haven't shown up yet, I'll...

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.567
Do you come with peace pipe
or bearing musket?

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.686
Hasn't anyone ever told you no before?

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.845
Well, not as frequently
or as emphatically as you have, no.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.088
You just dropped a grenade in my lap.

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.211
What do you want me to say?

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:06.524
I don't know what I want you to say.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.329
I just like it when you say things.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.891
You want to go look at some ice?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.565
Take a walk? Get out of here?

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.166
Yeah. Are you kidding me?
Ice? Frozen water?

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.044
It's like my favorite thing
in the whole world.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.882
Eight trillion hits on YouTube.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:33.731
That ain't bad, you know,
for your first song.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.449
How pissed is your girlfriend?

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.930
Um, I would not know.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:51.641
God, I wish you could see
this place in the summer.

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.040
Yeah.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.170
Oh.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.560
You hear that sound? What is that?

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.324
A pod of whales communicating?

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.045
Lake whales, yes.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:04.727
I always thought God's belly
after a burrito.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.326
I don't know. Sounded like a warning.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.608
Just winter crying uncle.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.764
I love living in a place where you earn
your seasons, you know?

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.806
Tough it out, see the ice
return itself to mud,

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.042
slimy reeds...

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.969
become hopeful again.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.330
Hannah, do you feel that?

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.810
I want to.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.802
Would you mind if I kissed you?

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.641
You know, I swam all the way
across this lake once.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.643
In the middle it feels like
it'll never end.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.245
Yeah, but you made it.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.641
Yeah, there again and back.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.842
Please let me kiss you.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.331
No.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.528
Look at this.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.569
Yeah.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.731
Hi.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.441
Mmm.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.250
Mmm, you smell good.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.449
Hannah, you smell like dessert and Hawaii

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.722
and a long winter's...

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.647
Hey.

01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.643
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay?

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.881
- What's wrong?
- God.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.088
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.969
It's okay, all right? I get it.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.770
I'm telling you, he doesn't want you

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.969
to be a puddle of tears
the rest of your life, okay?

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.286
I promise you that, okay?

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:00.205
It's not... it's not what he would want.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.771
Okay?

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.970
You don't get to say that.

01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.845
Why not?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.005
'Cause... 'cause
it's a conflict of interest.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:27.124
How is this supposed to work?

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.806
Hmm?

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.131
Hmm?

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.330
I mean...

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.321
I mean, I am competing with a saint.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.323
What?

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.086
His recording studio
is a shrine, you know?

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.005
You've got a single album on your iPod.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.208
Hannah, there is grief
and then there is worship.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.328
Yeah, please stop talking.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.091
- Mm, I totally fell for it.
- Fell for what?

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.163
I paid you everything I had left.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.004
Take the money.
I don't care about the money.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.640
I put you up. Hell, I'm even putting out.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.325
And I'm rescuing you.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.241
Okay? I wrote that book
so you wouldn't have to.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.364
It's just a bunch of words.
It'll never be enough.

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.000
I know! I know.

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.001
Hunter was an amazing guy.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.009
He really was.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.727
But all I see is the girl that he wrote
his best songs about,

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.087
and I love the shit out of her.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.530
I mean, I love her.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.169
But she loves him.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.283
Hannah.

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.283
Al.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.086
I'm so sorry.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.210
She really appreciated
all those articles you wrote about her.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.126
We got emails about it for weeks after.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.645
Oh, Al.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.321
Hey.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.649
I hope you got all your wishes.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.008
You're going to come back
as one awesome kitty.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.845
Do me a favor.

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.003
When you see him...

01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.764
say good-bye for me.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.204
