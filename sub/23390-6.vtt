02:27.003 --> 02:28.403
What do you think?

02:28.958 --> 02:31.028
- Oh, it's perfect.
- Yeah.

02:34.761 --> 02:36.519
Oh! Oh.

02:37.106 --> 02:38.770
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

02:38.781 --> 02:40.223
GALLO: Happy birthday!

02:40.234 --> 02:41.441
Welcome.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.477
- Hi. Good to see you.
- Oh.

02:43.487 --> 02:45.562
David, come on in.
It must be at least ten minutes

02:45.572 --> 02:47.452
- since you've had a drink.
- Oh, what a relief.

02:47.463 --> 02:49.640
I was worried we were
gonna have to get along.

02:49.651 --> 02:50.651
After you.

02:51.578 --> 02:53.919
I hope you don't mind
I invited a few of my friends.

02:53.929 --> 02:56.258
Oh, no, not at all.
You know I love your friends.

02:56.268 --> 02:58.292
Yes, it's been noticed.

02:58.302 --> 03:00.410
I might have preferred
to have two parties, though...

03:00.420 --> 03:03.247
one for my friends and one for yours.

03:03.257 --> 03:05.999
Only the Queen of England
has two parties.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.081
I'm afraid you're
not that sort of queen.

03:08.092 --> 03:11.388
Oh, Gallo, you're like
a jukebox of bitchy hits.

03:11.398 --> 03:13.431
LIZZIE: Happy birthday, shmoo!

03:13.433 --> 03:15.559
- Hi! Hi.
- (SQUEALS, LAUGHS)

03:15.569 --> 03:18.270
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh.

03:18.272 --> 03:21.181
ANDREW: This whole party
is about one thing...

03:21.191 --> 03:22.699
getting David.

03:22.709 --> 03:25.369
That cute blonde from San Francisco?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.621
The man of my dreams.

03:27.631 --> 03:30.424
Can I ask...

03:30.434 --> 03:32.550
are you officially gay now?

03:34.507 --> 03:35.876
You know I don't like labels.

03:35.887 --> 03:38.037
Neither do I,
but sometimes it's nice to know

03:38.048 --> 03:41.357
what's inside the can,
especially before you... eat it.

03:44.177 --> 03:46.349
- You're disgraceful.
- Okay, okay.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.107
But what are you gonna tell
your dream man about this place?

03:49.118 --> 03:51.045
- Oh, he doesn't know about Norman.
- What?

03:51.056 --> 03:53.613
- How can he not know?
- Because I like to keep them separated.

03:53.623 --> 03:56.700
I... That's why I wanted
to have two parties.

03:56.710 --> 03:59.610
But I couldn't not invite David
to my birthday.

03:59.621 --> 04:02.289
That's why I need you
to help me explain to him

04:02.299 --> 04:04.241
what I'm doing here with Norman.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.652
What are you doing here?

04:07.050 --> 04:08.578
I curate his art.

04:08.588 --> 04:11.381
I find pieces of antique furniture.

04:11.391 --> 04:15.761
Are you sure there isn't something
else that you've been curating?

04:15.772 --> 04:17.581
Lizzie, that's not even a play on words.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.265
- I know.
- There's nothing sexual between us.

04:20.267 --> 04:22.392
Then why can't you tell David the truth?

04:22.402 --> 04:24.594
You're a handsome,
young interior designer

04:24.604 --> 04:27.272
who's living with his wealthy,
older client.

04:28.253 --> 04:30.484
- I see the problem.
- God.

04:30.878 --> 04:32.644
I-I can't lose him.

04:32.654 --> 04:34.688
I-I can't, I just can't.

04:34.698 --> 04:37.565
Hey, you've got it bad for him.

04:38.952 --> 04:40.831
He's a house.

04:41.301 --> 04:42.801
He's a, he's a home.

04:43.707 --> 04:47.777
He's a yard and a family and...

04:48.378 --> 04:52.956
picking kids up from school. He's...

04:52.966 --> 04:55.261
(SIGHS) He's a future.

04:55.272 --> 04:58.123
And up until now,
I've only dated the past.

04:59.887 --> 05:02.277
Who are you trying to be?

05:05.512 --> 05:07.645
Someone he can love.

- Uh...

05:25.316 --> 05:27.232
No, come with me.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.705
Yeah, I thought
we could go on some hikes.

05:33.707 --> 05:35.261
Give the bars a rest for a weekend.

05:35.272 --> 05:37.272
For the party,
I really want you to wear these.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.460
(SCOFFS)

05:45.511 --> 05:47.552
And you need to give me this.

05:49.410 --> 05:52.331
You want me to pretend that
that's my gift to you?

05:52.342 --> 05:54.501
You know that friend
I was telling you about.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.269
Oh, yeah. David.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.972
He's coming, and I want him
to see that I have...

05:59.983 --> 06:01.925
really good friends.

06:02.485 --> 06:03.893
Well, I am a good friend.

06:03.903 --> 06:06.167
Yes, of course you are, but...

06:06.178 --> 06:07.339
I...

06:08.658 --> 06:10.347
I need you to...

06:10.358 --> 06:12.274
to look the part.

06:13.205 --> 06:15.822
- What does a good friend look like?
- I'm not asking you to do

06:15.832 --> 06:17.503
anything you don't want to do, I just...

06:17.514 --> 06:19.496
I just want a little bit of help.

06:19.507 --> 06:22.331
I've helped you with countless guys.

06:22.535 --> 06:24.972
(LAUGHS): Okay,
but how is this gonna help?

06:24.983 --> 06:27.817
I just need him to see that I'm loved.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.738
I do love you, buddy.

06:30.749 --> 06:32.082
I need him to know that.

06:34.522 --> 06:35.522
Okay.

06:36.812 --> 06:38.212
Whatever you want.

06:38.230 --> 06:39.680
It's your birthday.

06:43.435 --> 06:46.820
Oh, uh, before I forget... I told
him you're an officer in the Navy.

06:46.830 --> 06:49.856
You're a lieutenant
on the aircraft carrier

06:49.866 --> 06:51.858
the USS Independence.

06:51.868 --> 06:53.785
Are you out of your mind?

06:53.787 --> 06:55.505
I'm not in the Navy anymore.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.714
I'm aware of that.

06:56.724 --> 06:58.917
Andrew, I'm not gonna
impersonate an officer.

06:58.928 --> 07:02.358
But, Jeff, being an officer
in the Navy just sounds...

07:02.369 --> 07:04.462
so impressive.

07:04.464 --> 07:06.135
I know it does.

07:06.145 --> 07:07.841
So be in the Navy.

07:07.851 --> 07:10.121

07:10.132 --> 07:13.653

Lizzie's my best friend
from San Francisco.

08:15.319 --> 08:18.719
Oh, right. Yeah. From when you were
designing costumes with Versace.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.401
We've been, uh, friends
for what? Eight years?

08:22.411 --> 08:23.800
Uh, we met at a debutante ball.

I'm also the godfather of her son.

anyone the way he talks about you.

- You haven't opened it.
- Oh, I don't have to. It's perfect.

I don't think I'll ever open it.
I just want to look at it.

- Mm-hmm.
- It wasn't clear from your letters.

Is this your home address
or your work address?

08:47.830 --> 08:50.998

I've done so much work on it.

- Uh, Versace.
- Ferragamo.

09:25.644 --> 09:27.698
Versace doesn't make shoes.

09:27.708 --> 09:31.108
That would require at least some
degree of craftsmanship.

Do I have to unwrap it right now?

You think Norman's
the lucky one, don't you?

10:40.630 --> 10:42.241
But you're wrong; you're the lucky one.

10:42.252 --> 10:45.033
- Is that so?
- Norman's a conservative old queer.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.673
He likes the fact that you
can carry on a conversation

10:47.684 --> 10:49.310
and decipher a wine list.

10:49.474 --> 10:52.432
Most men would make it clear
that you're an employee,

10:52.442 --> 10:54.551
but he wants you to feel
like you're an equal.

10:54.561 --> 10:55.900
I am his equal.

- Yes, I know.

10:59.778 --> 11:01.903
If you'll excuse me, Gallo.

11:01.914 --> 11:04.526
I care about him a great deal.

11:04.537 --> 11:06.689
He was vulnerable the night he met you.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.615
His lover had suffered terribly.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.533
You don't need to lecture me.

11:10.543 --> 11:12.379
I volunteer at an AIDS charity.

11:12.398 --> 11:14.440
I know all about Norman's partner.

11:14.645 --> 11:16.973
You know nothing about him.

11:16.984 --> 11:18.801
What it's like to lose a man like that,

11:18.812 --> 11:20.576
to watch him waste away.

11:20.587 --> 11:23.421
I won't allow Norman to be hurt again.

11:26.614 --> 11:29.552
You must be a very unpopular party guest

11:29.562 --> 11:32.231
if all of your gifts are this dreary.

11:32.242 --> 11:34.348
I don't mind being disliked.

11:35.602 --> 11:37.435
Well, how fortunate for you.

11:38.839 --> 11:40.947
What a volatile mix you are.

11:40.957 --> 11:43.441
Too lazy to work
and too proud to be kept.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.210
I need to get back to my party.

11:45.212 --> 11:47.254
That room is full of people
that love me.

11:47.264 --> 11:50.965
Then that room is full of people
who don't know you.

11:56.139 --> 11:59.057
(BOTH LAUGHING)

12:04.253 --> 12:07.732
Jeff, is your boyfriend coming tonight?

12:08.184 --> 12:09.542
Uh, no. No, he's not.

12:09.552 --> 12:11.544
- That's a shame; he's so funny.
- Mm.

12:11.554 --> 12:13.346
Is he still working at that mall?

12:13.356 --> 12:15.348
He works for a living, yes.

12:16.355 --> 12:18.468
I was just trying to figure out
where you sleep.

12:18.478 --> 12:20.478
Well, what do you mean? (CHUCKLES)

12:20.480 --> 12:25.275
Well, I found a bedroom with
a master bed and two mattresses.

12:25.285 --> 12:27.544
Norman spends a lot of his time
in Phoenix,

12:27.555 --> 12:30.665
and I often have to go back
to my New York apartment.

12:31.614 --> 12:34.200
- Your New York apartment?
- Mm-hmm.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.005
- I thought I'd be sleeping here, but...
- Oh, you must!

12:37.016 --> 12:38.020
I have a couch.

12:38.031 --> 12:40.456
His couch is hard and filthy.

12:40.903 --> 12:42.591
(DAVID LAUGHS)

12:43.723 --> 12:45.940
Uh, let's talk about it later, okay?

12:47.473 --> 12:49.130
Who wants more champagne?

12:49.141 --> 12:50.278
LEE: Andrew.

12:50.989 --> 12:53.252
I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

12:53.263 --> 12:55.255
Oh, you're so kind.

12:55.265 --> 12:56.589
Uh, I'm sorry,

12:56.599 --> 12:59.391
I'm sure we've met before. I...

12:59.402 --> 13:00.560
Lee.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.197
Lee Miglin.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.216
(CHUCKLES)

13:03.227 --> 13:05.997
- From Chicago.
- Yes! Yes, Lee.

13:06.008 --> 13:07.482
Of course, I remember.

13:07.493 --> 13:10.486
Um, I'll-I'll join you in a second.

13:10.496 --> 13:12.216
- If you'll excuse us.
- Mm.

13:12.910 --> 13:15.080
- Sorry about that...
- I asked you not to approach me.

13:15.091 --> 13:17.493
I couldn't wait any longer.
I've been staring at you

13:17.503 --> 13:20.163
across the room for that whole thing.

13:20.173 --> 13:22.837
You look so exceptionally handsome...

13:22.848 --> 13:24.654
- That's very nice of you, but...
- No,

13:24.665 --> 13:26.336
but I-I had to talk to you.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.150
Does that make me pathetic?

13:28.161 --> 13:30.908
- I get the drift.
- I-I got you a birthday present.

13:30.934 --> 13:33.143
But I'd like to give it to you
in private.

13:33.154 --> 13:35.013
- We can arrange a time.
- Promise?

13:35.024 --> 13:37.346
I-I promise. Now, we need
to get back to the party,

13:37.357 --> 13:39.390
- because I don't want people to talk.
- Okay.

13:44.525 --> 13:47.398
David! I want a picture with David.
Photo time.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.720
I'd love a photo. Come on.

13:48.731 --> 13:50.517
Shouldn't it be a group photo?

13:50.719 --> 13:52.277
No, no. I'll-I'll take it.

13:52.288 --> 13:54.238
Oh. No, come on, Jeff.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.530
- David, come here.
- Oh, Norman.

13:55.541 --> 13:57.533
- Good to have you here. You sure?
- DAVID: Norman.

13:57.543 --> 14:00.286
- Yeah.
- All right, I guess it's picture time.

14:00.296 --> 14:02.155
- All right.
- I'll take it.

14:02.165 --> 14:05.575
- Thank you, Lizzie. Everybody together.
- Okay. Are you ready?

14:05.585 --> 14:07.493
- All right, squeeze together.
- (CHUCKLES)

14:07.503 --> 14:09.462

14:09.472 --> 14:11.589

14:32.022 --> 14:33.572
NORMAN: What's this?

14:33.582 --> 14:35.232
A list of requirements.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.735
If we are going to stay together.

14:37.745 --> 14:39.161
List of requirements.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.674
Increased living allowance.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.044
First-class flights.

14:45.054 --> 14:46.840
International and domestic.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.499
Of course. A Mercedes SL600?

14:49.509 --> 14:50.960
It's the car of my dreams.

14:50.970 --> 14:54.792
And you wish to be written
into my will as my sole heir.

14:55.547 --> 14:58.012
Well, we've been together
for over a year.

14:59.308 --> 15:01.908
I've devoted my life
to making you happy.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.441
I've made enormous sacrifices.

15:06.451 --> 15:08.201
What have you sacrificed?

15:09.138 --> 15:10.447
Love.

15:10.457 --> 15:11.876
Whose love?

15:11.886 --> 15:13.653
My parents' love.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.163
Ah. Yes.

15:16.190 --> 15:18.125
The New York millionaires.

15:18.135 --> 15:20.177
They disinherited me

15:20.187 --> 15:23.447
when they found out I was living
with an older gay man.

15:23.457 --> 15:29.219
Andrew, do you know
how I became successful in life?

15:29.229 --> 15:32.306
By working very hard.

15:32.316 --> 15:35.192
And by doing due diligence.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.494
Okay, what are you saying?

15:37.504 --> 15:42.533
I'm saying that your name
is not Andrew DeSilva.

15:42.543 --> 15:45.327
It's Andrew Cunanan.

15:46.547 --> 15:49.273
Who told you that? That's not true.

15:49.283 --> 15:52.167
Two years ago, you were working
in a Thrifty drugstore.

15:52.169 --> 15:55.337
- That's not true.
- Earning $6.16 an hour.

15:55.339 --> 15:58.298
- That's-that's not true.
- Living in a small condo

15:58.308 --> 16:02.060
with your mother, Mary Anne.

16:10.104 --> 16:12.070
♪ ♪

16:25.369 --> 16:27.361
Andrew.

16:27.371 --> 16:30.197
You investigated me?

16:30.207 --> 16:32.507
You investigated me.

16:34.211 --> 16:38.188
We didn't meet by chance, did we?

16:38.198 --> 16:40.848
You knew which books I liked,
which music.

16:42.870 --> 16:45.470
You researched me, and you pursued me.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.582
You're not my prisoner.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.601
You're not even my partner anymore.

16:50.611 --> 16:53.194
When's the last time we
were intimate, three months ago?

16:53.204 --> 16:55.355
If you give me everything on that list,

16:55.365 --> 16:57.274
sex can become more regular.

16:57.284 --> 17:00.118
Andrew, I will increase
your living allowance.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.612
God knows you have no savings,

17:02.622 --> 17:05.799
because every dollar I give you,
you spend on other people.

17:05.809 --> 17:09.086
But as far
as the first-class flights, no.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.664
I'll pay for you to return to college

17:10.674 --> 17:12.728
and to finish your degree.

17:12.738 --> 17:14.137
(SCOFFS) I already have a PhD.

17:14.147 --> 17:16.404
No, you do not have a PhD.

17:16.414 --> 17:18.653
You started a history major at UCSD,

17:18.663 --> 17:20.566
and you quit after a year.

17:20.576 --> 17:22.566
I'm not going back to school!

17:22.576 --> 17:23.733
It's-it's insulting!

17:23.742 --> 17:25.836
What is it about having an education

17:25.846 --> 17:28.738
and the idea of work
that you find so insulting?

17:28.748 --> 17:30.665
It's ordinary!

17:30.667 --> 17:32.667
Andrew, you're smart.

17:32.669 --> 17:34.669
But being smart is useless

17:34.671 --> 17:36.630
unless it's in the service of something.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.915
I want that list.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.668
Or I'm leaving.

17:41.678 --> 17:43.570
(SIGHS)

17:43.580 --> 17:45.772
You've made a beautiful home.

17:45.782 --> 17:48.758
I want you to be happy. I really do.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.853
And I don't mind
that you tell a few lies

17:51.855 --> 17:54.014
to smooth over the discomfort
of this arrangement.

17:54.024 --> 17:57.084
Hell, I-I can allow you
all of the lies that you want.

17:57.094 --> 17:59.136
EXCEPT FOR ONE:

17:59.146 --> 18:01.847
that I'm a fool.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.475
Do you get that I probably lost
the love of my life

18:05.485 --> 18:07.444
by living with you?

18:07.454 --> 18:11.181
That handsome young man at the party.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.324
David.

18:14.228 --> 18:15.844
Hmm.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.171
Oh, boy.

18:17.181 --> 18:20.191
Tell me something.

18:20.201 --> 18:22.382
If I make you my heir,

18:22.392 --> 18:24.011
would you still want me around?

18:24.021 --> 18:26.889
Or have you already started dreaming
of the day that I'm not here?

18:27.324 --> 18:29.650
You can have this life.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.252
You can have it for yourself.

18:32.262 --> 18:35.263
If you work for it.

18:35.265 --> 18:39.601
But if you don't,
you must share it with me.

18:40.638 --> 18:42.671
There is no third way.

18:42.673 --> 18:45.841
If I can't have love,

18:46.693 --> 18:49.477
I want that list.

18:51.148 --> 18:54.082
So is it a yes or a no?

18:55.252 --> 18:57.219
No.

21:26.271 --> 21:28.395
Did you send my dad a postcard?

21:28.405 --> 21:29.982
- What?
- To my home address

21:29.993 --> 21:32.807
in DeKalb, Illinois.
Addressed to Stan Trail.

21:32.817 --> 21:35.612
You signed the postcard "Love,
Drew." You don't remember that?

21:35.623 --> 21:36.936
Uh, I-I...

21:36.946 --> 21:39.205
I remember sending a postcard. I...

21:39.215 --> 21:41.560
My dad called me asking who you were,

21:41.571 --> 21:43.810
why you signed a postcard "Love, Drew,"

21:43.821 --> 21:46.204
and why I'm buying you expensive shoes.

How funny.

What did you tell him?

Did you do it deliberately?

21:54.033 --> 21:56.108
What, send your dad a postcard?

21:56.118 --> 21:57.576
Kind of felt like a threat.

21:57.587 --> 21:59.653
A threat?

22:00.656 --> 22:02.930
- It was a mistake.
- You're lying.

22:02.941 --> 22:04.837
You want to tell my parents
I'm gay? Is that it?

22:04.848 --> 22:06.993
Why would I want to tell
your parents that you're gay?

22:07.004 --> 22:09.037

that you gave up

42:42.252 --> 42:43.481
Come...

42:47.307 --> 42:49.257
(SINGING "FA LA NINNA" IN ITALIAN)

42:59.657 --> 43:01.481
Whenever I cried,

43:02.144 --> 43:05.359
my mother would sing
this lullaby to me...

43:07.085 --> 43:09.635
the same lullaby her mother sang to her.

43:12.113 --> 43:14.307
30 years later,

43:15.479 --> 43:17.513
I sing it to you.

43:20.445 --> 43:22.610
And one day,

43:23.198 --> 43:25.621
you're gonna sing it to your children.

43:26.618 --> 43:29.452
That's how it is with family.

43:31.203 --> 43:33.653
I'm not gonna have any children.

43:34.559 --> 43:36.718
(MARY ANNE INHALES SHARPLY)

43:37.166 --> 43:38.301
What?

43:40.165 --> 43:42.198
That's nonsense.

43:44.202 --> 43:47.070
Life means nothing without children.

43:49.942 --> 43:52.379
How can you not have children?

43:53.426 --> 43:55.004
That's...

43:56.014 --> 43:57.879
that's no life.

44:05.363 --> 44:07.520
And why do you smell like that?

44:09.785 --> 44:11.160
That's...

44:13.031 --> 44:14.168
You don't...

44:15.167 --> 44:17.012
you don't smell like you.

44:18.220 --> 44:20.098
(SNIFFING)

44:20.906 --> 44:22.512
I know your smell.

44:23.770 --> 44:25.746
This is not your smell.

44:27.356 --> 44:29.749
I'm gonna make you...

44:29.760 --> 44:31.993
smell like you again.

44:33.676 --> 44:37.077
(SINGING IN ITALIAN)

44:40.684 --> 44:43.351
You remember that boy
you went to school with...

44:43.361 --> 44:45.945
handsome, but not so bright?

44:45.947 --> 44:48.454
- Charley... Charles Walker.
- Mom...

44:48.465 --> 44:51.243
His father was a big shot banker.

44:51.253 --> 44:53.286
After college,

44:53.288 --> 44:56.331
that boy couldn't get a job.

44:56.341 --> 44:59.951
Even with his big shot banker
father pulling all of his

44:59.961 --> 45:02.337
- big shot banker strings.
- Hey, Mom?

45:02.347 --> 45:04.923
And sometimes I see the mother,

45:04.933 --> 45:06.341
who always looked down on me

45:06.351 --> 45:08.343
because we didn't have a big house...

45:08.353 --> 45:11.054
I'm unhappy.

45:13.926 --> 45:16.051
I saw her the other day.

45:17.028 --> 45:18.978
I told her...

45:20.982 --> 45:25.026
you were making costumes
for Italian operas.

45:25.036 --> 45:29.673
Traveling the world
with the legendary Versace,

45:29.684 --> 45:33.101
visiting Tokyo and Sydney

45:33.111 --> 45:36.410
and Moscow and Milan.

45:37.785 --> 45:39.916
All the places that I have never been.

45:42.613 --> 45:44.971
And her face.

45:47.774 --> 45:50.215
You should have seen it, Andrew.

45:50.987 --> 45:54.914
She was so jealous.

45:55.668 --> 45:58.226
Because we always had so little.

45:58.236 --> 46:02.347
And they... they always had so much.

46:02.357 --> 46:05.191
And their son... (SNIFFS)

46:05.888 --> 46:08.457
their son has done so little.

46:09.932 --> 46:12.559
And my son...

46:14.223 --> 46:16.469
my son has done so much.

46:34.348 --> 46:36.623
I gave you everything.

46:39.009 --> 46:41.087
But it was worth it...

46:42.127 --> 46:43.713
for moments like this.

46:46.322 --> 46:48.501
I wish you could stay with me.

46:50.939 --> 46:53.890
But I have to share you with the world.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.363
(MARY ANNE SIGHS)

47:05.374 --> 47:07.123
Okay.

47:13.482 --> 47:17.640
So... what city are you visiting next?

47:20.451 --> 47:22.243
Minneapolis.

47:22.253 --> 47:25.154
They have an opera house in Minneapolis?

47:28.755 --> 47:30.553
No, Mom.

47:32.022 --> 47:34.063
I don't think they do.

47:36.869 --> 47:38.466
(KISSING RAPIDLY)

47:52.358 --> 47:54.133
(ENGINE STARTS)

48:00.684 --> 48:02.076
Bye, Mom.
