Bay: <i> Previously on </i> Switched at Birth...

00:01.339 --> 00:04.058
- I would never try to replace your mom.
- She's still alive.

00:04.239 --> 00:06.747
- Is that your son?
- He's with my son-of-a-bitch ex-husband,

00:06.750 --> 00:07.744
wherever he is.

00:07.878 --> 00:09.980
- I'm Daphne.
- Vimla.

00:10.013 --> 00:12.248
Josh, here's the deal...
I need an interpreter.

00:12.282 --> 00:15.152
I can't believe there's
even one of you in existence.

00:15.184 --> 00:16.352
Fine.

00:16.385 --> 00:18.489
- Sorry I'm late.
- No worries.

00:18.521 --> 00:19.922
It was worth the wait.

00:19.956 --> 00:21.024
I went to get tested.

00:21.056 --> 00:23.360
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:23.393 --> 00:25.195
The baby has Down syndrome.

00:25.227 --> 00:27.998
For $600, 12 more people
could learn to sign?

00:28.031 --> 00:29.337
Uh-oh. I know that look.

00:29.457 --> 00:31.565
I could totally raise $600.

00:31.580 --> 00:32.767
I can't wait to tell Quinn!

00:32.792 --> 00:34.851
You're still talking with that guy?

00:34.884 --> 00:35.865
There's nothing going on.

00:35.906 --> 00:36.986
Mingo: He kissed you.

00:37.017 --> 00:39.420
It's weird that you're arranging
this whole fundraiser with him

00:39.455 --> 00:40.419
and I didn't know about it.

00:40.444 --> 00:41.091
I met a guy.

00:41.111 --> 00:42.464
Bay: His name is Garrett?

00:42.479 --> 00:44.267
- Garrett Banducci?
- Yeah.

00:44.277 --> 00:46.121
- That guy's a player.
- I can roll with that.

01:02.579 --> 01:03.478
Thank you.

01:03.598 --> 01:06.088
_

01:06.779 --> 01:11.857
It's supposed to be about
how we are many things at once

01:11.872 --> 01:14.800
or that words don't define us.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.906
_

01:16.906 --> 01:19.283
In a few days, they're going over

01:19.283 --> 01:21.736
to the Waite Gallery for my show.

01:22.574 --> 01:23.397
"My show."

01:23.412 --> 01:26.507
I have been dreaming about
saying that for years.

01:26.542 --> 01:27.890
I'm trying to do

01:27.921 --> 01:30.803
a few more before the actual event.

01:30.923 --> 01:33.115
I was thinking, um...

01:33.731 --> 01:36.315
Maybe I could sketch you some time.

01:36.435 --> 01:42.262
_

01:45.917 --> 01:49.022
Actually, I do it off of a photo.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.166
So, what are some words

01:56.206 --> 01:57.973
you would use to describe yourself?

01:58.327 --> 01:59.705
_

02:01.583 --> 02:03.592
_

02:05.723 --> 02:07.596
_

02:07.647 --> 02:09.267
_

02:15.749 --> 02:17.965
Okay, okay. Um...

02:18.085 --> 02:19.692
just time out.

02:19.737 --> 02:23.492
My mom or Eric could pop in at any moment.

02:24.932 --> 02:28.047
_

02:28.057 --> 02:30.576
_

02:30.696 --> 02:33.885
Yeah. Oh! I could bring that found art

02:33.916 --> 02:35.670
documentary I was telling you about.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.239
_

02:38.252 --> 02:40.145

02:40.183 --> 02:42.391
_

02:49.497 --> 02:50.898
(Sighs)

02:50.942 --> 02:52.318
I'm gonna go get a soda.

02:52.343 --> 02:53.618
Do you want anything?

02:53.883 --> 02:55.751
- Huh?
- Is that my phone?

02:55.953 --> 02:58.371
Oh. Yeah. Mine's completely out of juice.

02:58.402 --> 03:00.422
I'm, like, addicted to <i> Clash of Clans.</i>

03:00.542 --> 03:02.409
- Can I have it back?
- Yeah.

03:02.788 --> 03:04.795
I need to text Vimla

03:04.808 --> 03:07.388
about our presentation.
It's a third of our grade.

03:07.508 --> 03:08.524
What class?

03:08.544 --> 03:10.962
Biology seminar. I'll be right back.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.914
_

03:20.034 --> 03:22.469

03:22.505 --> 03:25.443

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:42.543 --> 03:45.345
But if we find out, then we can buy stuff

03:45.380 --> 03:46.572
and start making the nursery.

03:46.582 --> 03:48.668
Oh, you want to start gender stereotyping

03:48.673 --> 03:49.884
while the baby is still a fetus?

03:49.929 --> 03:51.595
I'm not gonna go out and

03:51.595 --> 03:53.206
buy dolls or trucks.

03:53.236 --> 03:55.139
I just mean prepare ourselves.

03:55.185 --> 03:57.042
Yeah, well, I have a lot going on right now

03:57.083 --> 03:59.380
without adding a whole other layer of...

04:03.727 --> 04:05.297
I just don't want to know, okay?

04:05.525 --> 04:06.303
Okay.

04:07.575 --> 04:09.251
We have a doctor's
appointment this week, right?

04:09.453 --> 04:10.518
I've moved it.

04:10.553 --> 04:12.042
Melody is away at a conference,

04:12.062 --> 04:13.345
and I have loads of work to finish

04:13.380 --> 04:14.450
before the end of the school term,

04:14.481 --> 04:16.161
and before I tell her that I'm actually

04:16.172 --> 04:18.110
quitting my job and moving back to London!

04:18.149 --> 04:20.442
- Hey, hey, hey.
- (Breathing heavily)

04:21.875 --> 04:23.517
Everything is gonna work out.

04:25.487 --> 04:26.971
I'll see you tonight.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074

04:36.850 --> 04:40.107
_

04:40.358 --> 04:43.004
The fact that this guy even likes my stuff

04:43.019 --> 04:45.003
is beyond crazy.

04:45.038 --> 04:48.279
I sent out 50 e-mails,
and I finally got a hit

04:48.299 --> 04:51.172
from the coolest gallery in the Crossroads.

04:51.202 --> 04:52.853
That's so awesome.

04:52.908 --> 04:54.458
_

04:54.534 --> 04:56.483
- You really do.
- Thank you.

04:56.751 --> 05:00.542
So, how's it going with Mr. Banducci?

05:00.603 --> 05:05.129
Mm. It's good. We actually
have a date tonight.

05:05.767 --> 05:07.900
I'm going to his place.

05:08.247 --> 05:11.503
That'll be the first
time since you and Emmett

05:11.623 --> 05:14.810
- and since...
- The whole Tank thing.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.018
_

05:17.138 --> 05:18.217
Yeah!

05:18.931 --> 05:22.313
Well, I guess I'm just...

05:22.433 --> 05:25.121
Used to being in a relationship.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.503
You know, I've never really

05:26.522 --> 05:29.847
done the straight up
"hook up" thing before,

05:29.967 --> 05:33.198
and... (Sighs) I don't know.

05:33.255 --> 05:35.899
I thought that we might have

05:35.899 --> 05:38.979
more of a connection by now.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.106
_

05:41.163 --> 05:44.709
_

05:45.201 --> 05:47.827
You just met him. Give him a chance.

05:47.947 --> 05:51.033
And plus, casual doesn't
always stay casual.

05:51.153 --> 05:53.330
Mingo and I started the same way.

05:53.380 --> 05:54.611
Look at us now.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.841
True.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.361
So what are you up to today?

06:08.481 --> 06:11.087
I told John I'd give him
a hand at the car wash.

06:11.838 --> 06:15.378
He's got some painting, a
busted window, other stuff.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.962
He was gonna hire somebody...

06:16.975 --> 06:18.294
But you offered to do it.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.463
It's easy stuff, and a few cosmetic
patches may help the place sell.

06:21.532 --> 06:22.977
That would be really great for them.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.528
I thought it would have been sold by now.

06:25.988 --> 06:28.455
Yeah, they seem to be holding up okay.

06:28.493 --> 06:29.932
I mean, I didn't want to ask.

06:29.945 --> 06:32.412
- Well, I've been broke a lot.
- Me, too.

06:32.468 --> 06:34.715
But for folks like them who
are used to having everything,

06:34.722 --> 06:36.905
you know, it can't be easy.

06:37.512 --> 06:39.657
That's really nice of you.

06:39.950 --> 06:42.396
They're my family now, too, right?

06:51.085 --> 06:53.950
"So while there is no human
pheromone <i> per se,</i>

06:53.988 --> 06:56.505
biologists agree that a person's odorprint

06:56.518 --> 06:58.764
plays a big role in sexual attraction."

07:02.380 --> 07:05.214
I still think we should start
with the discovery of bombykol.

07:05.334 --> 07:07.732
It's the first pheromone
identified in nature.

07:07.757 --> 07:10.560
- It's history.
- But we only have 15 minutes.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.419
We have to focus on
what's relevant to humans.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.536
- (Sighs)
- (Phone vibrates)

07:16.967 --> 07:20.811
_

07:20.931 --> 07:24.357
_

07:24.477 --> 07:26.288
That's rude. It's like whispering.

07:26.314 --> 07:28.377
I'm communicating with my client.

07:28.383 --> 07:29.790
Well, if it's about the
assignment, say it out loud.

07:29.803 --> 07:33.194
- Actually, it's not.
- I'm allowed to have a personal conversation.

07:33.214 --> 07:35.350
We have work to do, in
case you haven't noticed.

07:35.370 --> 07:37.111
Can you two stop bickering, please?

07:37.131 --> 07:37.969
I'm out of here.

07:38.156 --> 07:39.337
Wait... what?

07:39.535 --> 07:41.992
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry, okay?

07:42.017 --> 07:44.249
I'll be there for the actual presentation.

07:44.486 --> 07:45.860
Josh!

07:47.849 --> 07:49.677
What is going on between you two?

07:49.707 --> 07:51.929
You guys have been at each
other's throats all day.

07:51.979 --> 07:54.385
We're having problems... obviously.

07:55.482 --> 07:56.820
Has he said anything to you?

07:56.865 --> 07:57.941
No.

07:58.511 --> 08:02.403
He has been moodier than usual.

08:02.681 --> 08:04.235
So it's not me...

08:04.270 --> 08:05.184
I don't know.

08:05.356 --> 08:07.047
But we have to focus.

08:07.239 --> 08:09.789
Can you guys keep the peace
until after the presentation?

08:09.814 --> 08:12.691
- It's just two more days.
- I'm not the problem.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.988
Maybe you can talk to him.

08:15.108 --> 08:16.286
Find out what's going on.

08:16.301 --> 08:18.083
I don't want to get in the middle.

08:19.073 --> 08:21.381
You want all our study
sessions to end like this?

08:22.027 --> 08:23.016
All right.

08:23.193 --> 08:24.944
I'll see what I can do.

08:27.712 --> 08:29.660
Josh: Of course she's blaming me.

08:29.696 --> 08:31.352
She's not blaming you.

08:31.751 --> 08:33.755
I don't know why she brought you into this.

08:33.784 --> 08:35.895
Because your fighting is affecting our work

08:36.015 --> 08:38.198
and you're both my friends.

08:39.273 --> 08:41.226
Is there something going on with you?

08:45.095 --> 08:46.523
It's stupid.

08:46.731 --> 08:48.249
What?

08:49.204 --> 08:52.071
I'm having feelings for someone else.

08:53.771 --> 08:54.939
Oh.

08:55.809 --> 08:59.944
Nothing's happened and
I'm sure that nothing will.

09:01.004 --> 09:04.245
So telling Vimla will
just make her feel bad.

09:06.482 --> 09:08.037
Do I...

09:09.330 --> 09:10.910
Can you say who it is?

09:11.152 --> 09:12.940
I don't want to talk about it.

09:13.606 --> 09:15.570
Okay? It's hopeless.

09:16.418 --> 09:18.705
Hey, hey! Party people!

09:20.330 --> 09:22.511
I thought you guys were
supposed to be working.

09:22.557 --> 09:25.146
- What's up, man?
- I was just leaving.

09:25.162 --> 09:27.333
Wait, no. Can you give us a second?

09:27.363 --> 09:28.989
It's okay.

09:29.428 --> 09:32.383
I'll see you later, all
right? I'll see ya, Mingo.

09:34.917 --> 09:36.144
What was that about?

09:36.709 --> 09:38.745
He and Vimla just had a fight.

09:38.750 --> 09:39.704
Oh.

09:39.759 --> 09:42.874
He told me he has
feelings for somebody else.

09:42.934 --> 09:44.105
Who? You?

09:44.225 --> 09:45.908
Very funny.

09:46.028 --> 09:48.376
I asked him who, but he got evasive,

09:48.401 --> 09:51.188
which is weird because
we talk about everything.

09:53.294 --> 09:55.363
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

09:55.414 --> 09:57.444
I think it is you.

09:58.039 --> 09:59.403
That's ridiculous.

09:59.415 --> 10:02.074
No, he's always asking
me how serious we are,

10:02.094 --> 10:04.558
and if we plan on moving in
together, stuff like that.

10:06.390 --> 10:08.526
He's my interpreter. He can't like me.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.293
I'll have to fire him
or he'll have to quit.

10:11.682 --> 10:13.449
This is a disaster.

10:16.372 --> 10:18.369
What am I gonna tell Vimla?

10:27.908 --> 10:29.473
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:29.524 --> 10:32.275
- Barley Pop?
- My man.

10:33.189 --> 10:36.122
You patched up the broken
tile on the bathroom floor.

10:36.148 --> 10:38.390
- You didn't have to do that.
- It wasn't a problem.

10:39.048 --> 10:40.329
Any more offers?

10:40.379 --> 10:41.994
Nothing to speak of.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.003
You know, I bought some time.

10:45.043 --> 10:47.109
Cashed in some bonds that were coming due.

10:47.144 --> 10:49.593
Well, things are looking up.

10:50.058 --> 10:51.511
Can't sit in the cash though.

10:51.541 --> 10:53.137
You know, smart thing would be to...

10:53.465 --> 10:56.120
Roll what I don't need right
away into something new, you know?

10:56.312 --> 10:57.928
Not a problem I'm familiar with.

10:58.109 --> 10:59.099
Well...

10:59.644 --> 11:02.946
Let's just say everybody
wants too much up front.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.945
Real estate is a total gamble, so...

11:06.107 --> 11:07.265
You know, one of my regulars

11:07.293 --> 11:08.666
at the coffeehouse mentioned something.

11:09.337 --> 11:10.855
A place that's up and running.

11:11.064 --> 11:12.198
Established.

11:13.052 --> 11:14.477
So, what's the catch?

11:16.780 --> 11:18.072
It's a...

11:20.039 --> 11:21.767
Gentlemen's club.

11:22.442 --> 11:23.969
The Brandy Rose.

11:24.554 --> 11:26.097
Is that the strip club

11:26.112 --> 11:27.918
with all those billboards around town?

11:27.967 --> 11:29.727
- Yeah.
- Oh!

11:31.181 --> 11:33.749
Hey, it's packed at all hours,
and men always gonna wanna

11:33.769 --> 11:36.135
- drink and look at pretty women.
- Yeah, they are.

11:36.475 --> 11:38.308
Hey, look, I'm just putting it out there.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.725
Do with it what you will.

11:39.759 --> 11:40.794
I appreciate it.

11:40.827 --> 11:43.247
It sounds like a great
opportunity for somebody,

11:43.261 --> 11:44.353
just not me.

11:44.473 --> 11:45.565
I hear you.

11:45.876 --> 11:48.848
Being an ex-Republican
state senator and all...

11:48.872 --> 11:51.481
- Right. Of course.
- (Chuckles)

11:51.687 --> 11:54.274
Look, give me about 10 more
minutes here and I'm done.

11:54.307 --> 11:55.237
Hey, no rush.

11:55.273 --> 11:57.164
Thank you very much, by the way.

11:59.535 --> 12:00.892
Vimla: He didn't say anything?

12:01.325 --> 12:02.912
He was evasive.

12:03.162 --> 12:04.874
- Can we get back to this?
- Evasive how?

12:04.886 --> 12:06.376
What were his words exactly?

12:06.554 --> 12:09.510
He said what you said.
That you guys were fighting

12:09.514 --> 12:11.606
and that he didn't want
to get into it with me.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.045
Okay, now you're being evasive.

12:14.045 --> 12:15.552
Maybe you should talk to him.

12:16.626 --> 12:18.096
Okay, I will.

12:18.108 --> 12:19.360
Wait! Not right now.

12:19.380 --> 12:20.580
We have work to do.

12:22.458 --> 12:23.508
Daphne...

12:24.421 --> 12:25.672
He...

12:26.255 --> 12:29.166
Has feelings for someone else.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.462
Oh, my god.

12:32.495 --> 12:35.066
But he hasn't acted on
them. They're just feelings.

12:36.533 --> 12:37.567
Who is she?

12:37.600 --> 12:39.336
I don't know. He didn't say.

12:41.638 --> 12:43.722
Well, the only girl he talks to regularly

12:43.738 --> 12:45.479
is his cousin and...

12:46.247 --> 12:47.413
And you.

12:52.037 --> 12:55.753
This happens a lot with
interpreters and their clients.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.232
They spend so much time together,

12:57.262 --> 12:59.403
and their relationship
is so intimate, but...

12:59.523 --> 13:02.401
I had no idea and I never encouraged it.

13:02.411 --> 13:04.456
- I swear.
- I don't believe this!

13:04.456 --> 13:06.162
You're as type "A" as I am.

13:07.016 --> 13:08.954
I mean, if he wanted somebody different...

13:10.519 --> 13:12.210
You should talk to Josh.

13:12.330 --> 13:14.906
- I'm going to.
- But not right now.

13:15.441 --> 13:17.182
We have a presentation.

13:22.039 --> 13:23.860
You're right. Thank you.

13:24.961 --> 13:26.965
And please don't tell him I said anything.

13:27.257 --> 13:28.500
(Sighs)

13:31.293 --> 13:35.553

13:55.716 --> 13:57.241
I... I got it.

13:57.246 --> 14:00.093
_

14:00.138 --> 14:01.768
What do you mean?

14:01.975 --> 14:08.261
_

14:08.381 --> 14:10.639
I'm already having a good time.

14:10.759 --> 14:13.839
_

14:17.015 --> 14:18.100
Okay.

14:18.322 --> 14:20.655
Wow. Um...

14:24.735 --> 14:27.683
_

14:27.714 --> 14:30.707
_

14:31.283 --> 14:32.449
All of them.

14:32.499 --> 14:34.609
That's good. That's good.

14:34.729 --> 14:39.491
_

14:40.112 --> 14:43.353
_

14:43.363 --> 14:45.791
_

14:45.806 --> 14:49.812
That... that's fine.
I... I totally trust you.

14:49.995 --> 14:54.564
_

14:54.627 --> 14:57.397
_

14:57.447 --> 15:00.760
_

15:01.884 --> 15:05.051
Um... oh! Oh! I just realized...

15:05.171 --> 15:08.586
I have an early shift tomorrow.

15:08.636 --> 15:11.078
I'm just gonna... I'm
gonna leave the movie here.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.287
You should watch it. It's really good.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.631
Thank you for dinner.

15:15.975 --> 15:17.515
(Door opens)

15:20.657 --> 15:23.889
So, how's it going in the
world of young and single?

15:23.921 --> 15:25.964
You still hanging with
that dock worker dude?

15:25.990 --> 15:27.983
Uh... yeah.

15:29.650 --> 15:31.463
What? Something happen?

15:32.530 --> 15:35.800
I kind of bailed in the
middle of our date last night.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.035
How come?

15:37.068 --> 15:41.564
Well, things were going
in a certain direction.

15:42.479 --> 15:45.242
And this would have been
the first time since...

15:45.275 --> 15:46.897
Yeah, but...

15:47.078 --> 15:48.914
That's not it.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.482
Okay, there are certain areas

15:51.515 --> 15:55.031
where I am still very much J.V.

15:55.075 --> 15:58.451
and Garrett is total varsity.

15:58.470 --> 16:02.490
Actually, whatever the next level
beyond varsity is, that's him.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.772
- He's experienced.
- Way more experienced.

16:05.816 --> 16:08.334
He gets tested for STDs, like, weekly.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.913
And he had a Costco sized
container of... props.

16:12.159 --> 16:14.278
I don't know. I got freaked out.

16:14.537 --> 16:16.329
Well, at least he's responsible.

16:16.449 --> 16:17.478
That's true.

16:17.598 --> 16:20.583
- And communicative.
- That's also true.

16:20.633 --> 16:22.824
Look, do what feels right.

16:22.874 --> 16:25.215
You know, if you're not
ready, you're not ready.

16:25.499 --> 16:27.134
It's cool.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.445
Let's end this super
awkward conversation now.

16:31.508 --> 16:33.029
Done.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.949
So now, Josh is avoiding me,

16:38.968 --> 16:40.963
Vimla is pissed off at me,

16:40.988 --> 16:42.692
and the project still isn't finished.

16:42.749 --> 16:45.777
- When's the presentation?
- Tomorrow... or never,

16:45.802 --> 16:48.213
- if Josh and Vimla aren't talking to each other.
-(Phone vibrates)

16:48.333 --> 16:50.479
- Or me.
- (Vibrating continues)

16:50.599 --> 16:55.356
_

16:55.590 --> 16:58.984
- Was that Josh?
- No. Uh... Bay.

16:59.016 --> 17:00.587
Right.

17:01.944 --> 17:03.969
I'm gonna fail another class.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.955
Let me help. Josh is coming
over for an ASL lesson later.

17:07.021 --> 17:08.712
Are you sure? He's gone A.W.O.L.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.726
Well, he didn't cancel.
I'll talk to him man-to-man.

17:11.846 --> 17:12.922
And say what?

17:13.041 --> 17:13.916
"Back off"?

17:14.037 --> 17:15.199
He knows we're together.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.309
I'll give him a reality check. I'll say,

17:17.365 --> 17:18.809
"hey, man, what are you thinking?"

17:18.809 --> 17:20.656
And he'll say, "yeah, you're right."

17:20.864 --> 17:21.722
It's that simple?

17:21.727 --> 17:23.903
Trust me, guys don't need a
lot of words to make a point.

17:23.954 --> 17:27.326
I don't think you and Josh
speak the same dude dialect.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.037
Close enough. We're buds,

17:29.057 --> 17:30.991
he teaches me ASL three times a week,

17:31.021 --> 17:33.505
I know how to talk to him.

17:34.838 --> 17:36.040
A strip club?

17:36.160 --> 17:37.519
Have you lost your mind?

17:37.559 --> 17:39.054
It's a gentlemen's club.

17:39.174 --> 17:42.327
Call it what you want,
it's still degrading.

17:42.447 --> 17:43.811
I talked to the guy.

17:43.931 --> 17:46.295
One of his investors
cashed out and retired.

17:46.415 --> 17:48.234
Now he needs a new silent partner.

17:48.274 --> 17:50.884
Our names will be
nowhere near the business.

17:50.909 --> 17:53.226
I had Marty check it out. He was impressed.

17:53.346 --> 17:54.751
I think it's a solid deal.

17:54.927 --> 17:56.310
That is not the point.

17:56.335 --> 17:59.541
Those places exploit women's sexuality.

17:59.566 --> 18:02.227
Says the best-selling author of erotica.

18:03.297 --> 18:04.363
Wait...

18:05.444 --> 18:08.478
My erotica is not pornography.

18:08.498 --> 18:09.619
It's tasteful

18:09.644 --> 18:10.875
and literary.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.823
- There is a spectrum.
- Just like with these clubs.

18:13.985 --> 18:17.322
You're thinking about all those
seedy joints out by the airport.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.442
Oh, and this place is the Taj Mahal?

18:19.482 --> 18:22.522
It's suit and tie, they
have a great wine list...

18:23.758 --> 18:26.493
You know what? Why don't
we go check it out together?

18:26.613 --> 18:28.856
You want me to go to a strip club?

18:29.139 --> 18:30.250
Why not?

18:30.275 --> 18:31.996
If it's as bad as you think it is,

18:32.017 --> 18:32.945
we're done.

18:33.127 --> 18:34.127
If it's not,

18:34.641 --> 18:37.711
will you at least consider
it with an open mind?

18:38.362 --> 18:39.564
I'll try.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.423
- Hey there.
- Oh, Regina. Hi.

18:49.455 --> 18:51.624
Melody is out for a few
days at a conference.

18:51.657 --> 18:53.626
I know. I came by to see you.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.311
Bring you some mommy
tea and some croissants.

18:56.528 --> 18:59.537
I drank it when I was pregnant.
Put me right to sleep...

18:59.784 --> 19:02.183
Until I had to get up to pee nine times.

19:02.193 --> 19:03.920
I mean, nothing is really
gonna help with that.

19:03.976 --> 19:04.950
Well, thank you.

19:05.713 --> 19:07.821
I was overdue for a mom-to-mom visit,

19:07.848 --> 19:10.175
and I just wanted to check
in, see how you're doing.

19:10.477 --> 19:12.610
Fine, yeah. All fine.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.131
Yeah?

19:14.251 --> 19:16.286
Are you all right? Is it pain?

19:16.286 --> 19:18.765
No, no, it's more of a... tightening.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.935
It's been coming and going all day.

19:20.995 --> 19:22.525
Those are contractions.

19:22.550 --> 19:25.569
- Contrac... oh! Oh! Oh!
- Okay, let's sit down.

19:25.689 --> 19:27.287
No, wait. Stand up.

19:27.661 --> 19:29.719
I can't remember. Um...

19:29.839 --> 19:32.202
Why don't we just get
you to your doctor, huh?

19:32.955 --> 19:34.121
It's gonna be fine.

19:34.181 --> 19:35.746
Come on.

19:44.723 --> 19:45.889
Hey.

19:46.009 --> 19:50.160
_

19:50.280 --> 19:53.026
I'm sorry about the other night.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.278
_

19:54.338 --> 19:57.922
_

19:58.175 --> 20:01.714
_

20:01.718 --> 20:03.177
You get what?

20:03.622 --> 20:06.610
_

20:06.822 --> 20:09.497
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:09.617 --> 20:13.162
_

20:13.769 --> 20:16.874
_

20:17.409 --> 20:21.736
_

20:21.796 --> 20:25.062
_

20:25.062 --> 20:27.884
Um, I really should get back to work.

20:31.307 --> 20:33.690
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.815
It's probably just Braxton-Hicks.

20:40.026 --> 20:41.238
Yeah.

20:46.186 --> 20:47.504
Lily: Your daughter is adorable.

20:47.519 --> 20:49.341
- How old is she?
- Six.

20:49.461 --> 20:50.568
Wow.

20:50.573 --> 20:52.638
That's young to be reading
such a big book, isn't it?

20:52.679 --> 20:55.410
Yeah. She was reading at
four and never stopped.

20:55.435 --> 20:56.919
I keep having to buy more and more books

20:56.935 --> 20:58.636
because she just goes through them.

20:59.731 --> 21:01.231
My oldest is the athlete.

21:01.276 --> 21:03.421
She walked at nine months, ran at 11.

21:03.477 --> 21:04.976
She's gonna be our Mia Hamm.

21:05.260 --> 21:08.141
My husband is thrilled to have
a sporty kid, let me tell you.

21:08.177 --> 21:10.489
They go snowboarding, rock climbing.

21:10.545 --> 21:12.094
His little best friend.

21:13.725 --> 21:16.012
- Your first?
- Yeah.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.536
You'll see.

21:17.656 --> 21:20.111
It's so exciting watching
them conquer the world.

21:20.643 --> 21:23.636
Then you blink and they'll
be off to college, right?

21:25.560 --> 21:27.377
Nurse: Lily Summers?

21:30.548 --> 21:31.977
She's right here.

21:32.097 --> 21:34.319
Lily. You're...

21:35.001 --> 21:36.672
There you go.

21:36.718 --> 21:37.991
Bye.

21:42.796 --> 21:44.135
How dare you!

21:44.150 --> 21:45.296
_

21:45.301 --> 21:48.602
You told Garret about
what happened with Tank!

21:49.567 --> 21:54.137
_

21:54.307 --> 21:57.696
So let him be confused or have him ask me.

21:57.741 --> 22:00.886
It is not your place to decide when people

22:00.946 --> 22:02.663
get to know my secrets.

22:02.699 --> 22:05.258
What if I told someone you were dating

22:05.293 --> 22:08.622
about your most private,
horrible experience?

22:08.933 --> 22:12.709
_

22:12.755 --> 22:14.749
_

22:14.825 --> 22:17.486
With your help I am sure he did.

22:17.541 --> 22:21.232
_

22:21.257 --> 22:26.023
_

22:26.038 --> 22:28.769
Then stay out of my business, okay?

22:38.550 --> 22:40.953
(Sultry music playing)

22:43.207 --> 22:45.827
See? What did I tell ya?

22:46.357 --> 22:49.518
Not seedy, not depressing...

22:50.578 --> 22:52.406
It's still a strip club.

22:52.526 --> 22:54.546
<i> ♪ Whip me, baby ♪</i>

22:54.592 --> 22:57.161
<i> ♪ I'm your tiger ♪</i>

22:57.197 --> 23:01.681
<i> ♪ come and tame me, ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ </i>

23:03.574 --> 23:05.522
Hello. Welcome to the Brandy Rose.

23:05.573 --> 23:07.617
What can I get you
beautiful people to drink?

23:07.678 --> 23:10.344
I'll have a glass of Chardonnay.

23:10.374 --> 23:12.737
We have a Napa Valley and a White Burgundy.

23:12.747 --> 23:14.055
The Napa is more buttery,

23:14.100 --> 23:15.600
like most California Chardonnays.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.292
I prefer the Burgundy though.

23:17.317 --> 23:19.209
It's got a nice
minerality... nice and crisp.

23:19.230 --> 23:21.628
- Sold.
- And how 'bout you, handsome?

23:22.037 --> 23:24.167
I'll have a scotch on the rocks, please.

23:24.202 --> 23:25.545
You got it. Be right back.

23:26.292 --> 23:28.488
Isn't she cute?

23:28.654 --> 23:30.946
Isn't she a little
young to be working here?

23:30.991 --> 23:32.913
- Don't you think?
- She looks 21 to me.

23:32.915 --> 23:34.106
Young and cute.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.136
That's good for business, right?

23:35.141 --> 23:37.675
I mean, it is the skin trade
we're talking about here.

23:37.690 --> 23:39.957
All right, no need to be melodramatic.

23:40.077 --> 23:43.360
Wow. Look at the mark
up on these cocktails.

23:43.385 --> 23:45.601
They must be printing money.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.979
What percentage of this
business would we own?

23:48.035 --> 23:49.488
Hey, folks.

23:50.261 --> 23:53.017
Wow, aren't you two a good-looking pair.

23:53.052 --> 23:54.107
Oh, thank you.

23:54.799 --> 23:57.249
I'm Georgia. Have you two been here before?

23:57.282 --> 23:59.686
No. No, Georgia. This is our first time.

23:59.727 --> 24:01.489
Oh, my goodness. I love newbies.

24:01.519 --> 24:04.028
Okay, now, I don't know if you know,

24:04.148 --> 24:06.496
but you haven't had the
full Brandy Rose experience

24:06.521 --> 24:08.515
until you've had a private dance.

24:08.551 --> 24:09.888
And I don't mean to brag,

24:10.008 --> 24:12.044
but I am the best...

24:12.301 --> 24:14.072
That there is.

24:14.123 --> 24:15.329
That's nice...

24:15.360 --> 24:16.490
John, how about it?

24:16.521 --> 24:18.222
You want a private dance with Georgia?

24:18.262 --> 24:20.160
- You know...
- Oh, I also do couples.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.301
We have drinks on the way, but thank you.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.967
- All right.
- Kathryn: Oh, wait!

24:24.007 --> 24:26.319
I am really interested in your work.

24:26.375 --> 24:29.031
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

24:29.151 --> 24:31.656
No, I don't mind. But I gotta keep moving.

24:31.681 --> 24:33.378
If I don't dance, I don't get paid.

24:33.448 --> 24:36.651
Ah... Well, how about if
we talk while you dance?

24:36.686 --> 24:38.383
A private dance?

24:38.418 --> 24:40.347
- Kathryn...
- No, absolutely.

24:40.467 --> 24:42.411
- Come on. Follow me.
- All right.

24:43.932 --> 24:45.718
- I won't be long.
- Yeah...

24:45.781 --> 24:50.463
<i> ♪ I've been such a naughty lady ♪</i>

24:50.488 --> 24:52.886

24:52.949 --> 24:55.732
(Phone vibrates)

24:57.683 --> 25:01.949
_

25:05.610 --> 25:06.765
Hey.

25:07.516 --> 25:08.759
Hey, stranger.

25:08.784 --> 25:11.422
I have been studying at the Lambda house.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.233
They have a neck masseuse!

25:14.502 --> 25:16.474
How are you?

25:17.096 --> 25:18.592
I've been better.

25:19.077 --> 25:22.266
I know. Finals will be over soon.

25:22.281 --> 25:25.537
It's not finals. It's your cousin Josh.

25:28.919 --> 25:30.605
Mm. Yeah!

25:30.640 --> 25:32.199
Here, chase it down.

25:38.047 --> 25:41.000
So, what are we celebrating?

25:41.046 --> 25:43.696
Well, I hear that liquor
helps you loosen up

25:43.741 --> 25:46.159
when you're trying to learn
sign language, you know.

25:46.164 --> 25:48.164
Hey, look at me, it's working!

25:48.325 --> 25:49.446
Hey.

25:49.522 --> 25:53.015
So I'm out a partner and an interpreter.

25:53.851 --> 25:55.220
Did you know?

25:56.332 --> 25:58.200
Did I know what?

25:59.324 --> 26:00.459
Iris...

26:02.945 --> 26:04.853
I'm not sure... (Sighs)

26:04.973 --> 26:06.756
Look, I don't know if it's my place.

26:06.802 --> 26:08.493
If you know something that could help me,

26:08.503 --> 26:09.861
you have to tell me.

26:09.981 --> 26:11.669
You know, maybe not this big,

26:11.694 --> 26:14.440
but, like, same kind of style... tribal.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.176
I was thinking, like, right here.

26:16.975 --> 26:17.651
Yeah.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.988
Like, even kind of, like, higher
up, all the way on the delt.

26:20.108 --> 26:21.603
Man, that would look killer.

26:21.619 --> 26:24.491
Right, man. Yeah. You totally get it.

26:27.262 --> 26:29.242
I haven't told Daphne yet.

26:29.489 --> 26:31.824
I don't even know if she likes tattoos.

26:32.522 --> 26:34.900
Yeah, I mean, but what
if you guys break up?

26:35.020 --> 26:37.605
Then it won't really matter
what she thinks, right?

26:38.343 --> 26:39.983
Yeah. Um...

26:40.265 --> 26:42.929
It's interesting that
you mention that. Um...

26:43.188 --> 26:45.662
Look, man. I gotta be honest with you...

26:45.782 --> 26:47.113
Are you sure?

26:47.145 --> 26:48.394
Not even remotely.

26:48.458 --> 26:51.284
It's just something my mom mentioned once,

26:51.404 --> 26:53.770
that his parents wondered about.

26:54.205 --> 26:57.730
But I have no idea. Honestly,
I could be completely off.

26:58.089 --> 27:00.254
Look, bro...

27:00.822 --> 27:02.665
I have been there.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.201
I know it's tough. Believe me, I do.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.884
But... Daphne and I
have been through a lot,

27:07.903 --> 27:11.014
and we're in a really good
place now, you know? And...

27:11.134 --> 27:12.636
Whoa.

27:13.791 --> 27:15.072
What was that?

27:15.078 --> 27:17.426
Oh, crap. I...

27:18.934 --> 27:21.792
I'm... I'm really drunk.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.760
Mingo!

27:31.788 --> 27:33.984
Josh isn't into me!

27:34.288 --> 27:36.622
Yeah, I just got that.

27:44.675 --> 27:47.975
- Josh!
- I'm really sick.

27:48.095 --> 27:50.405
Wait, no! Hang on. Hang on.

27:54.444 --> 27:56.558
Why didn't you tell me?

27:57.744 --> 27:59.998
How would that conversation had gone?

28:00.338 --> 28:03.002
"Hey, I've got a thing for your boyfriend.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.791
Do you mind sharing?"

28:06.069 --> 28:08.859
- Even if I said yes, I don't think Mingo...
- Yeah.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.443
I know.

28:12.678 --> 28:16.078
Like I said, it was stupid.

28:25.335 --> 28:27.071
What about Vimla?

28:27.108 --> 28:28.698
I mean, do...

28:29.128 --> 28:31.298
Do you still like girls?

28:33.924 --> 28:35.229
I don't know.

28:35.349 --> 28:37.116
I'm still figuring it out.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.471
I mean, Vimla and I are probably done,

28:41.490 --> 28:43.909
but that's for a lot of reasons.

28:44.482 --> 28:45.636
Okay.

28:45.895 --> 28:51.777
Anyway, I know that straight
guys are out of bounds.

28:52.049 --> 28:53.766
I'm not judging.

28:54.630 --> 28:57.647
You know, he surprised me.

28:58.095 --> 29:02.071
I mean, he wasn't the
meat-head I thought he was

29:02.279 --> 29:05.680
and he thought I was cool.

29:07.599 --> 29:11.385
I guess I let my imagination just...

29:11.852 --> 29:13.829
Run away with me.

29:16.435 --> 29:19.679
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
show up for class today.

29:19.736 --> 29:23.869
I know you guys have a
presentation tomorrow.

29:23.989 --> 29:26.097
I gotta get it together.

29:32.642 --> 29:35.103
Yeah. Help me up?

29:36.934 --> 29:38.947
Thank you.

29:39.686 --> 29:41.200
Um...

29:45.585 --> 29:49.598
Look, I don't know what's going on with you

29:49.610 --> 29:52.128
and texting guy, but...

29:52.700 --> 29:56.620
It was Mingo's idea to have ASL lessons

29:56.637 --> 29:58.673
three days a week.

29:58.854 --> 30:01.050
I don't know a lot of guys who would

30:01.082 --> 30:04.458
go through that trouble and
expense for someone they like.

30:16.921 --> 30:18.619
Are you okay?

30:18.739 --> 30:20.194
Yeah.

30:20.828 --> 30:22.488
Contractions have stopped.

30:22.829 --> 30:24.732
Braxton-Hicks, like you said.

30:25.365 --> 30:28.022
That's not what I meant.

30:29.006 --> 30:32.875
I know what that mom in
the waiting room was saying

30:33.127 --> 30:35.500
must have been hard to hear.

30:36.345 --> 30:38.088
I've made my decision.

30:38.498 --> 30:40.176
I'm not allowed to be upset.

30:40.202 --> 30:42.038
Who says you're not allowed?

30:42.088 --> 30:44.354
No one made me have this baby.

30:44.638 --> 30:46.777
I know exactly what
I'm getting myself into,

30:46.809 --> 30:48.860
and I'd better get used
to feeling how I felt

30:48.885 --> 30:50.791
in that waiting room, because...

30:51.271 --> 30:53.946
I'm going to feel like this
for the rest of my life.

31:02.937 --> 31:04.521
First of all...

31:05.140 --> 31:07.695
I hate to break it to you,
but that is not special

31:07.733 --> 31:09.923
to Down syndrome parents.

31:10.144 --> 31:15.002
Every parent feels jealous and
insecure sometimes about their kid.

31:15.122 --> 31:16.890
Every single one.

31:17.174 --> 31:20.631
Just hearing how her daughter
snowboards with her husband...

31:20.751 --> 31:22.499
I want to give that to Toby.

31:22.562 --> 31:25.144
I want to have that experience myself.

31:25.327 --> 31:28.664
I want all those moments that parents get.

31:30.231 --> 31:32.600
This has only just started...

31:32.925 --> 31:35.853
And I'm starting to think
I made a huge mistake.

31:37.304 --> 31:40.608
- Please don't tell Toby that I've said that.
- Listen to me.

31:40.641 --> 31:45.351
It is completely normal to
have doubts and be scared.

31:45.749 --> 31:49.536
You're not a monster for feeling that way.

31:49.990 --> 31:52.957
One thing that I know for sure...

31:53.187 --> 31:55.991
Is that this is gonna be your kid.

31:56.023 --> 31:59.235
Not your Down syndrome kid but your kid.

31:59.253 --> 32:02.756
And you are gonna love him or her

32:02.819 --> 32:05.000
with everything that you have,

32:05.032 --> 32:07.268
once you two meet.

32:12.058 --> 32:16.024
This has barely even begun, and
I already feel like I'm failing.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.340
No, sweetie.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.265
You're not failing.

32:19.757 --> 32:21.454
You're just being a mom.

32:24.496 --> 32:29.096
And I think that you
need to start being honest

32:29.102 --> 32:31.311
with Toby about all this.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.665
You need to stop holding it in.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.082
Okay.

32:39.015 --> 32:40.668
Okay.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.965
Yeah.

32:50.662 --> 32:53.501
- First lap dance?
- Yeah.

32:53.508 --> 32:56.518
Just enjoy being entertained.

32:58.342 --> 32:59.995
Have you always been a dancer?

33:00.115 --> 33:01.901
I did ballet when I was a kid.

33:01.945 --> 33:04.091
Oh. Yeah, me too.

33:04.734 --> 33:07.789
Yeah, I still dance.

33:07.789 --> 33:09.416
Mostly tap.

33:10.312 --> 33:13.139
You know what? I'm thinking
about investing in this place.

33:13.152 --> 33:14.818
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:14.849 --> 33:17.235
- Do you like working here?
- Yeah.

33:17.285 --> 33:19.816
Money's great, hours are flexible,

33:19.829 --> 33:22.391
and I can go to school in the daytime.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.899
Oh. Wow.

33:24.019 --> 33:27.250
You go to school.

33:27.306 --> 33:30.265
- Yep. U.M.K.C.
- Oh!

33:30.507 --> 33:33.334
MBA and I'm almost done.

33:33.334 --> 33:34.298
Wow!

33:34.333 --> 33:35.762
What's next afterwards?

33:35.882 --> 33:39.285
Well, I created a workout
called "pas de pole."

33:39.405 --> 33:41.310
It combines the moves of pole dancing

33:41.335 --> 33:43.243
with the technique of ballet.

33:43.273 --> 33:46.091
- It is such a great workout.
- Oh, yeah? Can I see?

33:46.151 --> 33:47.513
Okay.

33:48.058 --> 33:50.164
Hip... turn...

33:50.234 --> 33:52.884
<i> ♪ Got me burning ♪</i>

33:53.687 --> 33:57.265
<i> ♪ she's passing in her mini-dress ♪</i>

33:57.306 --> 34:00.173
<i> ♪ and she always knows what to say ♪</i>

34:01.849 --> 34:06.201
Okay, so you grand plié into a swivel,

34:06.222 --> 34:08.679
real sexy, and then battement,

34:08.847 --> 34:12.330
and then soutenu, turn
it up and then hold it,

34:12.375 --> 34:14.424
pop that leg out, one, two,

34:14.500 --> 34:15.616
dip the head, three,

34:15.641 --> 34:17.251
and you flip it like you mean it on four.

34:17.302 --> 34:19.851
There we go! Nice!

34:21.734 --> 34:22.840
Um...

34:23.617 --> 34:25.309
I'm not gonna stay long.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.121
I just wanted to clear some things up.

34:30.378 --> 34:31.569
You were right.

34:33.453 --> 34:36.034
I wasn't honest with you the other night.

34:39.385 --> 34:40.768
This is still new...

34:41.581 --> 34:46.846
And I'm still figuring out
how to talk about it and when.

34:47.754 --> 34:51.184
But that's not what's happening here.

34:51.304 --> 34:55.649
_

34:56.454 --> 34:59.244
You have more...

34:59.759 --> 35:02.007
Experience than I do.

35:02.026 --> 35:04.743
A lot more. And I...

35:05.182 --> 35:09.180
I got a little... nervous.

35:09.372 --> 35:14.532
_

35:14.652 --> 35:19.763
_

35:21.948 --> 35:26.426
_

35:26.699 --> 35:30.071
You don't have to do anything differently.

35:31.818 --> 35:36.074
I'm not some fragile thing,
and I really didn't want

35:36.089 --> 35:38.139
the first person after

35:39.472 --> 35:43.351
to know, and then have a bunch of

35:43.649 --> 35:46.445
baggage about it, because it's my

35:46.803 --> 35:50.221
baggage and I'm dealing with it.

35:50.407 --> 35:56.632
_

35:59.147 --> 36:02.368
I do enjoy being with you.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.867
_

36:04.943 --> 36:09.068
_

36:10.900 --> 36:12.132
I wanna stay.

36:13.132 --> 36:15.969
_

36:16.241 --> 36:17.578
Positive.

36:20.593 --> 36:23.238
I have those feelings too sometimes.

36:24.081 --> 36:25.502
You do?

36:25.797 --> 36:27.270
Of course.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.374
It's terrifying what we're doing.

36:33.623 --> 36:37.385
But I don't think just because a
baby has Down syndrome means that

36:38.121 --> 36:41.076
they'll never play basketball or...

36:41.681 --> 36:42.863
Snowboard...

36:43.479 --> 36:45.065
Or listen to music.

36:47.847 --> 36:52.976
I think I can do all those
things with him or her...

36:55.066 --> 36:56.599
In our own way.

37:01.271 --> 37:04.308
I kept telling myself that I
didn't want to know the gender

37:04.542 --> 37:08.344
because it'd be fun to wait, be surprised.

37:09.545 --> 37:10.913
But...

37:11.337 --> 37:15.585
Actually, I think not knowing was
my of keeping the baby at a distance.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.656
So, now you want to know?

37:23.059 --> 37:24.982
Actually, I do know.

37:25.427 --> 37:26.630
What?

37:27.789 --> 37:30.394
I called Dr. Brunstetter back and asked.

37:31.167 --> 37:34.181
- Well, what are we having?
- Um...

37:34.242 --> 37:36.135
Oh, come on!

37:36.255 --> 37:38.134
Tell me! What are we having?

37:39.624 --> 37:42.436
You know, maybe it's best not to know.

37:43.146 --> 37:46.945
I mean, they say there are so
few real surprises left in life...

37:46.980 --> 37:48.719
Lily Margaret Summers.

37:52.024 --> 37:53.412
It's a boy.

37:56.073 --> 37:57.460
A boy?

38:00.495 --> 38:02.532
We're having a boy?

38:12.128 --> 38:15.399
You were right. That
place was totally sleazy.

38:15.813 --> 38:16.974
Really?

38:17.094 --> 38:18.953
I kind of thought it was classy.

38:19.013 --> 38:20.326
What are you talking about?

38:20.331 --> 38:22.835
Those girls were barely
older than Bay and Daphne.

38:22.870 --> 38:24.395
And all those men oggling them...

38:24.425 --> 38:25.743
They were gorgeous.

38:25.863 --> 38:27.701
I was oggling them, too.

38:27.717 --> 38:30.777
I mean, I wouldn't want Bay
or Daphne to work there...

38:30.802 --> 38:31.559
Damn right.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.961
It wasn't the depressing
pit of despair I imagined.

38:36.914 --> 38:38.828
But, honey, I

38:39.110 --> 38:40.841
don't think it's the right business for us.

38:40.851 --> 38:45.324
See? Okay, we're on the
same page. Say no more. Done.

38:45.546 --> 38:48.367
But you know what might
be the right business?

38:48.619 --> 38:49.508
What?

38:49.690 --> 38:51.280
Pas de pole.

38:52.340 --> 38:56.168
It's a new workout that
combines pole dancing and ballet.

38:58.145 --> 38:59.594
How'd it go?

38:59.714 --> 39:02.538
- A minus!
- Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

39:03.618 --> 39:05.022
Where's Vimla?

39:05.264 --> 39:08.576
Oh, she and Josh went out for coffee.

39:08.738 --> 39:09.949
They're not broken up?

39:10.480 --> 39:13.070
I don't know what they're
doing. They're talking.

39:13.190 --> 39:14.988
I thought he'd be really hungover,

39:15.026 --> 39:18.213
- but he was actually fine.
- Yeah, I made sure he was okay.

39:18.333 --> 39:21.211
Picked him up this morning and took
him to the Drip for an infusion.

39:21.268 --> 39:22.587
What's the Drip?

39:22.789 --> 39:25.028
It's that trendy place over in
the Power and Light District.

39:25.070 --> 39:27.325
The nurse will hook you
up to an IV vitamin drip.

39:27.726 --> 39:29.189
It's supposed to cure your hangover.

39:29.222 --> 39:30.611
You drove him?

39:30.656 --> 39:31.732
Wasn't that awkward?

39:31.961 --> 39:33.013
A little.

39:33.227 --> 39:34.725
But I couldn't let him jeopardize

39:34.753 --> 39:36.398
my girlfriend's grade, now could I?

39:36.679 --> 39:39.874
And we've all done stupid
stuff while we're drunk, right?

39:40.233 --> 39:43.037
He's a good guy and we're still friends.

39:43.070 --> 39:44.405
You're amazing.

39:44.439 --> 39:46.174
Don't make me blush.

39:47.492 --> 39:49.044
(Phone vibrates)

39:51.144 --> 39:52.713
(Vibrating continues)

39:55.081 --> 39:59.156
_

40:00.722 --> 40:03.621
_

40:03.654 --> 40:07.467
_

40:14.481 --> 40:17.901
I am so excited about this new series

40:17.913 --> 40:19.823
and you are my first commission.

40:19.980 --> 40:22.443
I was so happy when you
came into the coffeehouse.

40:22.563 --> 40:25.125
Well, those portraits up
there are pretty unique.

40:25.512 --> 40:26.414
Thank you.

40:26.446 --> 40:27.786
It made me think,

40:28.040 --> 40:30.484
"I wonder what that artist
would make out of me."

40:30.517 --> 40:31.718
I had to find out.

40:32.018 --> 40:35.116
Well, I'm just doing some
preliminary sketches right now.

40:35.116 --> 40:38.424
In the meantime, why don't you

40:39.013 --> 40:40.008
tell me about yourself?

40:40.128 --> 40:43.871
Like, what are some words
you would use to describe you?

40:44.558 --> 40:46.201
Well...

40:47.692 --> 40:49.154
I'm a survivor.

40:52.724 --> 40:53.874
I hear that.

40:54.065 --> 40:55.143
Anything else?

40:55.430 --> 40:56.811
Determined.

41:05.103 --> 41:06.320
Mother.

41:11.762 --> 41:13.955
Bay: Those are some great words.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.620
I think we're off and running.

41:16.028 --> 41:17.906
Yeah, I think we are, too.
