(yells)

00:08.400 --> 00:09.925
Summa Nura.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.923
Voice: Ash.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.527
Ash: (yells)
Ruby is in Elk Grove, Michigan.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.250
My hometown.

00:17.840 --> 00:20.605
- Ashley?
- Pablo, Kelly, meet my father.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.128
- You said your dad was dead.
- Uh, we were sort of dead to each other.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.045
Pablo: Ever since Ruby put that book on
my face, I've been having nightmares,

00:27.200 --> 00:29.123
but they happen while I'm awake.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.964
(distorted)
Where is The Necronomicon?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.281
I'll never tell you.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.521
- (growls)
- (screams)

00:33.720 --> 00:35.245
(Ash whistles)
Night-night.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.805
My children have turned on me.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.281
Help me retrieve the book,
and send them back to hell.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.840
Let's go save the world.

That cyborg hand of yours got
something against knocking on doors?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.244
Sorry, Dad.
Just going up to my room.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.688
It looks like you found Bigfoot.
Why you still here?

01:27.840 --> 01:30.207
Uh, we just, uh, got to take care
of some business.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.845
Just a couple of days,
then I'm gone.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.162
Oh, for Christ--
No more horseshit about demons.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.522
What difference does it make?
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.808
Look,Pop,
I know you don't want me here...

01:38.960 --> 01:41.611
Brock: You're the one that ran off like
a scalded dog, left me here alone.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.684
Yeah, news flash--
I wouldn't have, if you stood by me.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.367
Oh, so it's my fault because, what?
I didn't give you enough hugs?

01:48.520 --> 01:50.090
Sack up, sunshine.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.050
Now, look, I know that
I'm not the son you wanted.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.761
And I know that Elk Grove would rather
have a hero who doesn't live in a trailer,

01:56.920 --> 01:59.890
and doesn't have a boatload
of cold sores, but too bad!

02:00.040 --> 02:03.203
I am your son,
and I'm the only hero Elk Grove has.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.567
(Kelly and Pablo clearing throats)

02:05.720 --> 02:07.802
Uh, except those two.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.407
Uh, yeah, the jury's out on her.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.211
All right, here's the deal.
My lady's on her way over here.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.890
I'm going to be up to my elbows

02:16.040 --> 02:17.121
- in cheesecake real soon.
- (groans)

02:17.320 --> 02:20.164
And when your "business" is done,
you know where the door is.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.731
Great, Dad, thanks.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.729
Oh, and by the way,
"Bigfoot" has a name.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.565
- It's Ruby.
- Oh, is that so, Ruby?

02:32.720 --> 02:35.246
Well, tell your story walking.
I'm done conversating.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.448
Time for some fornicating.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.250
- Ugh.
- (chuckles)

02:51.600 --> 02:53.523
- Woman: Ash?
- (floorboards creaking)

02:53.680 --> 02:56.047
(whimpering)

02:56.200 --> 02:58.931
I want to get out of here!

02:59.080 --> 03:01.321
Help me, Ash!

03:01.480 --> 03:03.528
Shut it off.
(screaming)

03:03.680 --> 03:05.250
Look at me!

03:10.040 --> 03:11.644
- You okay?
- What's that?

03:11.800 --> 03:15.122
Another LSD moment?
Oh, man. I told you, dude.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.124
Florida LSD, not to be fucked with.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.965
Got to trust me on this shit.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.647
Yeah, got to be careful.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.241
(music playing)

03:34.120 --> 03:37.806
Oh, sweet room, Jefe.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.804
Yep, lot of good memories in here,
and there.

03:40.960 --> 03:43.088
(Pablo chuckles)

03:43.280 --> 03:45.169
It looks like it hasn't changed in...

03:45.320 --> 03:47.322
30 years, that's right.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.686
When I left this place back then,

03:48.840 --> 03:51.127
I left behind everyone
and everything I ever knew.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.044
Poor fella.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.521
Guess he didn't have the heart
to carry on without me.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.444
Kelly: Or the food.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.164
Come on, guys,
we don't have much time.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.402
You've seen how powerful
my children have become.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.167
Wait... your children?
Those things came out of me.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.564
Oh, relax, you're not the father,
just the portal for their rebirth.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.724
Are you saying Pablo is a vagina?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.962
Ruby:
You need to take this seriously, missy.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.202
My spawn pose
an existential threat,

04:19.399 --> 04:21.164
such as the world
has never seen before.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.204
They're not only more powerful
and more intelligent and dangerous--

04:24.360 --> 04:26.328
Okay, yeah, got it.
They're big, mean, smart.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.448
Just tell us where they are,
we'll go spank their naked butts.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.523
Nope, we got to retrieve
that Necronomicon

04:30.680 --> 04:32.011
before they get their hands on it.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.685
That's all we have to be
concerned about right now.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.841
This is easy!

04:35.040 --> 04:38.681
We'll be back in the Sunshine State
before you can say Fort Ticonderoga.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.202
- Where'd you put it?

The best hiding place
you could think of

06:44.160 --> 06:46.481
was a fucking corpse?!

06:46.640 --> 06:49.803
Dead flesh masks the scent of
the book from the spawn.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.850
So in terms of quick thinking,
not the worst idea.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.048
We could argue worse ideas
all day long, believe me.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.170
- Time to put on our dancing shoes.
- Hold up.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.210
- Family meeting.
- Not you.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.725
(Ruby grunts)

07:02.880 --> 07:05.360
I don't trust her, Jefe.
She's hiding something.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.329
Agreed.
Something's funky.

07:07.480 --> 07:10.006
'Cause if she's
some kind of half-demon,

07:10.160 --> 07:12.561
immortal badass,
why does she need us?

07:12.720 --> 07:15.371
Look, I would trust
a blind proctologist

07:15.520 --> 07:17.249
more than her,
but you know the deal.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.402
Unless you have a better plan?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.528
Leave her here with me
while you guys go get the book.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.523
I'll figure out
what she's not telling us.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.364
Kelly: Yeah, I don't think
that's such a great idea.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.521
Pablo: I got this.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.842
Trust and believe I'll carve her up
like a Halloween pumpkin

07:29.000 --> 07:31.731
- if she even looks at me funny.
- Damn, Pablo.

07:31.880 --> 07:36.044
- Badass.
- Not so much of a vagina now, am I?

07:36.200 --> 07:39.682
Well, actually, vaginas are powerful
and life-affirming.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.730
So technically, you're more of
a vagina now than you've ever been.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.486
She's right, buddy.
And I couldn't be prouder.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.171
Sorry, lady.
You're riding the pine today.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.443
Pablo, and his friend Mr. Kandarian
Dagger, would like a word.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.046
- (chuckles) No, no, no.
- It wasn't a question.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.686
You want your book back,
that's how it happens.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.725
Fine.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.726
Just, uh, don't touch any of my stuff.
Except to tidy up.

08:05.920 --> 08:09.083
Seriously, don't let her touch
any of my stuff.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.129
Except to tidy up.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.880

08:28.640 --> 08:30.802
(Ash sighs)

08:32.919 --> 08:35.126
Mm, must be hard coming back.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.970
Confronting your past

08:37.159 --> 08:40.562
and all your many mistakes
and bad decisions.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.280
Holy pickle dicks,
it's Lillian Pendergrass!

08:44.440 --> 08:45.930
Kelly:
What's a "Lillian Pendergrass"?

08:46.080 --> 08:49.084
That beautiful creature right there.
I'd know that caboose anywhere.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.925
- Are you having a stroke?
- Hey, you say that now,

08:52.080 --> 08:53.923
back in the day,
Lillian Pendergrass

08:54.080 --> 08:57.402
was a smoking hot former gymnast
turned Phys Ed teacher.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.846
You know what I'm talking about?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.129
She wore these tiny,
little polyester shorts.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.806
You know during the summer,
when you find that perfect peach?

09:04.960 --> 09:08.282
Your next words better be "the end,"
or I will shoot us both.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.721
- Me first.
- I'll give you the abridged version.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.170
(chuckfing)

09:15.360 --> 09:18.011
- I boned her in the back.
- Good for you.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.841
Ash: She's going to the house.
She must've heard that I'm back in town.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.809
(laughing)
Oh, no!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.764
Well, sorry, Lillian.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.806
Tool time's going to have to wait,
'cause Dad's got a job to do--

09:30.000 --> 09:31.490
- Hello.
- Looking good.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.642
(gagging)
Well, it looks like

09:33.840 --> 09:36.446
Big Daddy's
working from home today.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.001
That son of a bitch.
Not again.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.130
- Wait, again?
- (engine starts)

09:54.360 --> 09:55.964
(elevator bell dings)

09:58.320 --> 10:02.530
So, um, you give any thought to
how we explain what we're doing here?

10:02.680 --> 10:06.002
Relax, just a couple of regular people
taking a stroll in a hospital.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.367
Kelly: Morgue.
A hospital morgue.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.682
Nobody strolls through a morgue.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.008
We look shady as fuck.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.527
We get busted,
we're getting locked up.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.206
Okay. Nobody's gonna be
locked up, okay?

10:18.360 --> 10:20.886
I'm going to be like a ninja
losing his virginity--

10:21.040 --> 10:23.771
quick and discreet.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.400
You just guard that door.
Nobody gets in.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.846
(electricity buzzing)

10:32.680 --> 10:35.081
(lock clicks)

10:49.960 --> 10:53.521
Okay... probably should've
asked which one.

10:56.280 --> 11:01.002
Okay, bodies,
who's got the book?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.610
Oh! What a waste.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.445
- What a waste--
- (banging)

11:19.960 --> 11:21.405
(drill whirring)

11:30.800 --> 11:33.485
Come on, you piece of crap.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.042
- (chainsaw buzzing)
- (flesh squelching)

11:49.880 --> 11:52.087
(grunts)

11:52.240 --> 11:54.607
Fuck.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.723
(exhales sharply)

12:11.240 --> 12:13.481
Pablo: I need to know
what's happening to me.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.644
What did you do?
You make me evil, too?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.246
Oh, so this isn't about me at all.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.805
Well, it was very naughty of you
to deceive Ash like that.

12:25.600 --> 12:29.161
- But I'm very impressed.
- Yo, just answer the question!

12:29.320 --> 12:32.688
I would like to, but I honestly
have no idea what you're talking about.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.211
You do seem upset, though, so come on,
sit down, and tell me about it.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.324
Yeah, I don't want to sit.
I want to talk about the book.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.847
All right?
It did something to me.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.367
It changed me, and...

12:44.520 --> 12:46.887
you're going to tell me
exactly how right now!

12:48.800 --> 12:51.690
We do not have time for this.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.845
So, you're going to answer
my questions right now.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.520
(music playing)

12:58.680 --> 13:01.331
(flesh squelching)

13:07.960 --> 13:09.928
Wait a minute.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.891
Son of a bitch.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.044
Ash, look first, cut later.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.645
(sighs)

13:29.520 --> 13:31.682
Oh, of course.
There you are.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.047
Come on now.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.361
What the Harryhausen?
(grunts)

13:39.520 --> 13:41.568
Definitely getting locked up.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.484
(sighs)

13:53.360 --> 13:55.203
(whispers) F8Y9°-

13:59.200 --> 14:00.850
Come on.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.082
Come on, motherfucker!

14:04.280 --> 14:05.441
Hey, you know what?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.364
- (gun cocks)
- (elevator bell dings)

14:22.400 --> 14:25.404
(elevator bell dings)

14:32.800 --> 14:35.644
Give me my fucking pop!

14:35.800 --> 14:37.643
Going to jail.
Give it to me!

14:37.800 --> 14:40.565
(clears throat)

14:42.280 --> 14:44.362
Oh, hey.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.646
You know what?

14:45.800 --> 14:49.771
Great timing, because
your pop machine is on the fritz.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.763
(grunting)
Give...

14:51.920 --> 14:53.524
H".back!

15:07.480 --> 15:09.403
Oh, no, you don't.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.724
Nobody hides
from Ashley J. Williams.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.281
Hmm?

15:24.480 --> 15:26.005
- (screeching)
' (Ash groaning)

15:34.480 --> 15:35.561
(yells)

15:38.880 --> 15:41.884
This part of the hospital
is off limits.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.562
- Why are you here?
- I could ask you the same thing.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.485
There's been a lot of weird shit
happening around town lately.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.928
And your friend, Ash,
he ain't a stranger to weird shit, is he?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.082
Dude, he's like the father
of weird shit.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.846
So, you're going to have to be
much more specific.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.367
Lot of unexplained deaths lately.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.370
And then all of a sudden,
you and that bozo roll into town.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.164
Wow.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.244
Someone's on the fast track
to detective.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.408
All right, smart-ass.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.211
You stand there and crack wise.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.601
We'll just see
what the coroner has to say.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.411
But dollars to donuts,

16:18.560 --> 16:22.724
Ash Williams will figure in
his explanation somehow.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.291
Now, if you'll excuse me.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.768
I said, excuse me.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.250

16:49.480 --> 16:50.720

16:54.760 --> 16:57.570

- Oh, no, no, no.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.762
Oh, no, no.
Not up the butt!

17:07.960 --> 17:09.564
Not up the...

17:09.720 --> 17:11.449

Oh, God!

17:16.119 --> 17:18.646
Oh, God, I'm in the butt!
I'm in the butt.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.121

Don't you suck my johnson!

17:36.800 --> 17:39.041

Oh, okay. Okay!

17:59.280 --> 18:01.328
This town is only big enough
for one asshole,

18:01.480 --> 18:03.767
and that asshole is me.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.370
"Lillian Pendergrass.
Pneumonia?"

18:22.480 --> 18:25.086
That's not Lillian Pendergrass.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.287
(crowd cheering on TV)

18:29.440 --> 18:32.011
Mm, you smell like Lysol wipes.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.881
Man on TV: You will fight,
or fall, where you stand...

18:36.040 --> 18:38.327
When did you say
Ash would be back?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.889
- Uh, who?
- Ashley.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.044
- Your son.
- Oh, uh, who cares?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.965
Could be ten minutes,
could be 30 years.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.367
- Doubt if I'd be that lucky twice.
- Hmm.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.848
Why the interest anyway?
Surprised you even remember him.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.048
He's a tough one to forget.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.329
Ah, well, he's not going to
stop me from trying.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.288
Man on TV: A single Roman
lacks courage enough to face me!

19:03.440 --> 19:05.602
(crowd on TV booing)

19:07.640 --> 19:10.291
Ruby: Tell me what's been
happening to you.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.931
Come on, you're the one
who was crying for answers.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.969
L-I wasn't crying.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.521
You see, the book has never
attached itself to a human before.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.130
Is it possible that it left
some kind of an imprint?

19:26.280 --> 19:28.931
Some terrible knowledge?

19:29.080 --> 19:31.367
Are you having nightmares?

19:31.560 --> 19:32.925
Premonitions, or...

19:33.080 --> 19:35.242
Oh, premonitions.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.330
Good.
That's what we need to know.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.404
I ain't telling you shit, lady.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.444
- Kelly.
- Down here.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.161
- We got to get out of here right now!
- Oh, shit!

19:55.320 --> 19:57.243
What happened in there?

19:57.400 --> 20:00.085
Oh, uh, let's go with colonoscopy?

20:00.240 --> 20:03.005
- What the hell happened here?
- He was abusing his power.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.481
- I informed him of my rights.
- With a sledgehammer?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.489
Not my fault he got a glass jaw.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.650
Wow, he's really out.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.451
Soon as this asshole wakes up,
this asshole's going to jail.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.844
Number one-- never say "ass" or "hole"
in my presence ever again.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.126
- Got it?
- Got it.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.651
- Ever!
- Okay.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.768
Number two--
no one's going to jail.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.081
Witness.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.329
(chuckfing)
See that?

20:27.480 --> 20:29.130
Back in school,
when we used to beat him up,

20:29.280 --> 20:31.760
he would whiz himself,
but he never told the teachers.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.490
- Why?
- Because he pissed himself.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.642
Bingo.
So we could just keep doing it.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.485
That is horrible,
and also awesome.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.130
Which is everything that I do.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.851
Oh, newsflash,
we got to get home and save Pablo.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.331
Lillian is a Deadite.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.006
- (pounding)
- (whispers) Did you hear that?

20:47.160 --> 20:49.162
From upstairs.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.322
Oh, it's probably Ashley.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.888
Must've snuck in the back door
like some cowardly dog.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.283
Why don't you forget about Ashley
and slide on over here

20:58.480 --> 21:00.369
and give old Brock
some Splenda, huh?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.410
(chuckles)
Oh, I like the sound of that, Daddy.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.369
You get your fine self ready

21:05.520 --> 21:07.966
while I freshen up
in the little girls' room.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.606
I was born ready, turtle dove.
You just hurry back.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.841
You'll know where to find me.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.969
- (music playing on stereo)
- What about your dad?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.364
You only said we had to get back
to save Pablo.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.727
What about your dad?

21:27.880 --> 21:30.406
Kelly, in war, there's always
gonna be collateral damage.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.762
How can you say that, Ash?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.571
I mean, I know you two
don't get along, but he's family.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.165
He's your father.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.607
And he won't be around forever.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.888
Are you kidding me?
That old buzzard?

21:42.040 --> 21:43.371
That guy's going to outlive us all.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.727
That's just another way
the man upstairs

21:45.880 --> 21:47.450
chooses to shtup me in the pooper.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.204
(Kelly groans)

21:55.160 --> 21:56.525
- (gasps) Stop!
- Whoa, fuck!

21:56.680 --> 21:57.681
- Whoa!
- The fuck asshole?!

21:57.840 --> 22:01.083
Hey, don't give me that look, punk.
Roads are for cars.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.765
Fuck you!
You need to watch where you're going!

22:02.960 --> 22:05.964
And you need to wait until your balls drop
before you talk to me, son.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.121
- (laughing)
- Yeah?

22:07.280 --> 22:09.089
Well, your piece-of-shit car...

22:09.240 --> 22:11.083
(sniffing)
Smells like a piece of shit!

22:11.240 --> 22:12.241
- (laughing)
- Ash: Oh, yeah?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.641
Well, my piece-of-shit car
isn't the cause of this shit.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.928
It's all me, baby!
Beat it!

22:17.080 --> 22:19.208
- Hey, whoa, whoa!
- Yeah, sit and spin!

22:19.360 --> 22:22.011
- L_=uck you!
- Emvv puberty!

22:23.440 --> 22:24.965
- Fucking douche bag!
- Ash: Guess we told them, huh.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.167
Come on, Tyler.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.966
What the f... Hey.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.162
What? Oh, shit! What?

22:32.320 --> 22:34.607
No! No!

22:34.760 --> 22:36.762
Please! Please!
What are you doing to me?!

22:36.920 --> 22:38.410
Please stop! No!

22:39.720 --> 22:43.327
What a disappointment
you've turned out to be.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.926
You really don't know
what's going on, do you?

22:47.320 --> 22:50.130
No! I'm sorry, I-l don't know!

22:50.280 --> 22:53.648
- Precognition, Pablo.
- No!

22:53.800 --> 22:56.406
Ruby: Psychic ability
to see events in the future.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.807
Do you understand?
You're having a premonition.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.042
Just please cut me down!
Please!

23:02.280 --> 23:03.770
Cutyou?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.570
As you wish.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.331
. (Pounding on door)
' Go away!

23:16.480 --> 23:20.371
- Pablo.
- Lillian: Ashley, is that you, dear?

23:20.520 --> 23:22.807
- (pounding continues)
- It happened again, didn't it?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.126
- (yells)
- Tell me what you saw!

23:24.280 --> 23:25.770
- Lillian: Ashley?!
- Stay away from me!

23:25.960 --> 23:27.291
- Calm down and listen to me.
- Pablo: You tried to kill me!

23:30.120 --> 23:33.647
(distorted)
Well, look who it is!

23:33.800 --> 23:35.165
The traitor!

23:35.320 --> 23:38.244
Makes sense you'd be with Ash now.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.606
Ooh, Pablo!

24:26.160 --> 24:30.165
Okay, what did I tell you about
not touching any of my stuff?

24:31.400 --> 24:32.447
Except to tidy up.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.443
(gasping)

24:36.280 --> 24:38.362
You ready to tell me
what you saw now?

24:38.520 --> 24:40.727
You... you tried to kill me.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.928
You-you slit my throat
with some sort of a...

24:43.120 --> 24:45.248
- plink.
- Fingernail?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.767
Mm-hmm.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.769
- Baal.
- Both: Huh?

24:49.960 --> 24:53.203
Pablo's visions-- I know why my children
are after the Necronomicon now.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.567
They aim to raise up their father.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.524
(Ruby groans)
But I don't see the book.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.690
Where is it?
Where's the Necronomicon--

25:01.560 --> 25:03.608
- You failed.
- Ash: Let me tell you something.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.240
Ash Williams doesn't know
the meaning of a lot of words.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.090
But I really don't know
the meaning of "fail."

25:08.240 --> 25:10.083
- So where is it?
- I wasn't going to bring it in here

25:10.240 --> 25:11.241
with some Deadite.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.761
It's locked up in the Delta,
safe and sound.

25:13.920 --> 25:14.921

- (boy screams)

25:15.080 --> 25:18.004

25:19.640 --> 25:22.166
- Jefe, it's the Delta!
- (groans)

25:22.320 --> 25:23.765
Lillian?

25:23.920 --> 25:26.969
Took so long,
I had to start without you.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.487
Thought I told you to stay upstairs.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.563
Where in the hell is Lillian?

25:31.720 --> 25:34.166
- See ya!

25:35.440 --> 25:37.807
Fuck you, Ashy Slashy!

25:37.960 --> 25:41.442
