-See you later, buddy.

01:06.191 --> 01:11.071
I nominated Sarah because
she definitely has great potential.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.741
She's self-taught,
and she just needs that little extra help

01:14.824 --> 01:17.869

that she deserves.

of OMG's baking and decorating herself

Okay.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.629
My grooming routine is sad.

I'll usually just wash my hair
and throw it under a hat wet.

every color of beret that you can have.

Asian people are experiencing right now.

-Yeah.
-[Tan] Just heartbreaking.

We can't cough because we're Asian,
even if we have allergies or asthma.

with things like the floor.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.407
We run out of space a lot.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.660
-A lot of the baking takes a lot of space.
-Takes a lot of prep work.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.872
-So we're constantly, like, moving around.
-Running into each other.

07:35.955 --> 07:40.835
Yeah, it's a little maze-y, but everything
in here was brought in or built by us.

[Sarah] I cut and painted,
and then I wired it.

in the middle of a pandemic,

08:02.523 --> 08:06.903

a lot of these unfinished projects.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.905
I'm ready for my shift, ladies.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.701
So, I'm really curious.
How did you adapt during the pandemic?

08:13.784 --> 08:18.664
Oh, we pivoted so many times, I could
probably become a basketball player.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.707
-It just…
-[laughing]

08:19.790 --> 08:22.752
I mean, we ended up
closing our doors, like,

08:22.835 --> 08:27.298
right after what was, kind of,
a sort of sad attempt at a grand opening,

08:27.381 --> 08:28.966
like, mid-March last year.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.845
Then I ended up doing a lot of character
macarons, which are really popular.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.849
The last set that we did
was the Lunar New Year.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.685
-[Antoni] Hmm.
-And we put them online for presales.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.480
-They sold out in probably ten minutes.
-Jeez!

08:42.563 --> 08:46.526
But after about six or eight weeks
of really intense macaron making,

08:46.609 --> 08:48.402
it really took a toll on my body.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.864
-You were the only one making them?
-I'm the only person that makes them.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.784
-How?
-Um, a lot of hours.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.912
But, um, we had to, you know, make rent.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.790
-Jeez, your poor little hands.
-[chuckles] I know.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.252

09:27.775 --> 09:29.443
to be, like, five years from now?"

09:29.527 --> 09:34.615
Long term, I would love to be able
to do more of the, like, creativity part.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.410
Eventually, I'd love
to ship some of our stuff.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.120
We get requests sometimes,

09:39.203 --> 09:42.123
but we just can't meet the demand
with just me doing everything.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.625
So you are getting the requests.
You can't fulfill the demand?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.085
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-Wow.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.211
[Sarah] You wanna try one?

09:47.295 --> 09:50.089
-Pick out whichever face speaks to you.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.924
[Sarah] They're<i> </i>dulce de leche.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.178
Mmm!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.850
-I wasn't expecting like the actual…
-Oh, yeah.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.893
Thought it was whipped in.
This is unbelievable.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.562
It's both. It's whipped in and it's…

10:04.645 --> 10:06.439
And it's not too sweet.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.399
-[Sarah] Yes. I like--
-It's perfect.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.611
I can relate
to Sarah's passion for cooking,

10:11.694 --> 10:14.447
but she wants to be more involved
in the creative process

10:14.530 --> 10:16.907
and not just sitting
in the kitchen all day

10:16.991 --> 10:19.160
decorating these macarons and donuts.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.911
She should teach somebody
how to make those.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.456
Mmm! So good.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.004
Okay, tell me about
the beret thing we have.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.340
Berets just seemed very cute and fun,

10:32.423 --> 10:35.509
and also I can shove
all my hair in the beret. So…

10:35.593 --> 10:37.053
-Okay. Okay.
-[Sarah chuckles]

10:37.136 --> 10:39.847
What else makes an OMG Squee uniform?

10:39.930 --> 10:44.226
Well, we used to wear, um, like,
a black-and-white checkered shirt.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.645
-Okay.
-People liked them<i>.</i>

10:45.728 --> 10:47.772
-Yeah. [laughs]
-Except for Kelly, she hates them.

10:47.855 --> 10:49.565
Uh, but then, you know, the pandemic hit,

10:49.649 --> 10:54.695
and we just kind of fell into
just being in kind of regular clothes.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.948
-Sure.
-I wear a version of what I'm wearing now.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.701
-Can I see it without the apron?
-[Sarah] Sure.

11:00.785 --> 11:04.580
Okay. So, you do look a little messy,

11:04.664 --> 11:06.457
because there are a lot of stains.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.959
-And I see holes on your T-shirt.
-Yes, yes.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.253
For me, I'm struggling to see

11:11.337 --> 11:15.841
the person who is producing
the most beautiful, perfect content,

11:15.925 --> 11:17.968
but then, she's in a T-shirt and jeans.

11:18.052 --> 11:22.056
Yeah, I mean,
I feel like I used to try more.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.975
-I do like the vintage silhouettes.
-[Tan] Love.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.727
-[Sarah] You know…
-Like fit and flare?

11:26.811 --> 11:27.937
-Yes.
-Yeah.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.397
[Sarah] So, I do like to be fitted.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.315
-I like a good silhouette to…
-[Tan] Yeah.

11:31.399 --> 11:37.071
This week, I wanna get you back
to the Sarah who had this big dream.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.787
Can I just say,
I love your space so much.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.706
-Oh, thank you.
-So cheerful.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.541
-Oh, thank you.
-So bright.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.793
Take the beret off. We gotta see it.
Without further ado.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.420
-Do you wanna do the honors?
-Can I?

11:54.547 --> 11:57.133
-It's a lot going on under there.
-Wow.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.509
[laughs]

11:58.592 --> 12:00.177
Hunty.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.764
The moment I see her hair
from beneath this beret,

12:03.848 --> 12:04.932
the world stopped.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.269
So, tell me.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.688
So you used to do
all-over bleach and tone,

12:10.771 --> 12:12.898
and we did, like, some purple, some blue.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.235
Yeah, whenever I was trying
to grow it out, I just decided,

12:16.318 --> 12:18.112
"I'll just do something for fun,"

12:18.195 --> 12:21.073
and then kind of hated it
and then just let it go.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.409
When's, like, the last time you were like…

12:23.492 --> 12:26.996
[exhales] "My squee is overflowing."

12:27.079 --> 12:30.332
[laughs] Um, it's probably been a while.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.669
And I just stopped doing anything.
Probably like a lot of people.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.629
We're gonna do some self-care.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.841
I'm gonna get you a mani, get you a pedi,
so we can just, like, love on you a bit.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.968
I've never had a manicure or pedicure.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.138
[laughs] I know.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.347
In your whole life?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.141
-Oh, my God.
-[laughs]

12:47.224 --> 12:48.768
So it sounds like you're kind of ready

12:48.851 --> 12:53.105
to just dip
that toe back into the beauty pond

12:53.189 --> 12:55.274
and maybe just take,
like, a full-on plunge.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.026
Oh, I would love that.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.486
[Antoni] Yum.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.280
-Where's the ice cream?
-[both laughing]

13:02.114 --> 13:04.283
[Karamo] One of the things
I wanna learn about you is

13:04.366 --> 13:06.494
what your experience has been like,

13:06.577 --> 13:09.622
first of all, just as
a half Asian-American in Austin, Texas?

13:09.705 --> 13:12.833
I think my biggest tie
to my Asian culture is through food.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.377
Some people don't totally
understand what we're doing.

13:15.461 --> 13:19.298
They're like, "I don't understand why you
guys just can't have vanilla ice cream."

13:19.381 --> 13:24.595
"Well, you know, vanilla is great.
But so is, like, <i>ube</i> or black sesame."

13:25.179 --> 13:28.891
But you know, when the pandemic started,
we knew that there would be a backlash

13:28.974 --> 13:32.061
when we had a leader
saying things like the "China flu,"

13:32.144 --> 13:34.772
and sometimes
people don't see you as a person.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.775
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And we experienced a lot of that.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.778
Like, our sign got stolen,
people stole our Christmas decorations.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.780
-Somebody kicked the door.
-Okay.

13:42.863 --> 13:46.033
It used to be glass, and then
I decided as a safety precaution,

13:46.116 --> 13:47.785
we would replace
the door with a steel door.

13:47.868 --> 13:48.702
Got it.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.621
-We dealt with a lot.
-Yeah.

13:50.704 --> 13:55.501
-What are you feeling right now?
-Um, just overwhelmed.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.585
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.423
I do rely on Kelly a lot.
She's a very good friend that way.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.093
But a lot of people just don't understand.
There's just three of us.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.846
And I just, um… [sniffles]

14:06.929 --> 14:08.848
I give everything I have to this place.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.975
And how much time
do you have to give to yourself?

14:11.058 --> 14:12.017
Not very much.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.271
-Oh, my baby. I gotta come give you a hug.
-[laughs]

14:15.855 --> 14:18.399
-I know, you'd better. You made me cry.
-I know!

14:18.482 --> 14:21.360
We're gonna help you have some time
to get back to yourself, honestly.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.903
Oh, thank you.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.533
[Karamo] Before we get
this week started,

14:27.616 --> 14:30.578
I wanna know from you two, how do
you feel about what's about to happen?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.997
I'm really excited for Sarah.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.416
I really wanted people
to see how great she is.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.667
[Fab Five] Aww!

14:36.750 --> 14:39.128
-[Sarah] I love you.
-[Jonathan] But even better!

14:39.211 --> 14:42.006
Before we go,
can we get a squee together on three?

14:42.089 --> 14:44.174
One, two, three!

14:44.258 --> 14:46.260
[all] Squee!

14:46.343 --> 14:48.762
[cheering]

14:48.846 --> 14:50.890
[Karamo] Say bye,
'cause you're coming with us!

14:50.973 --> 14:53.017
[Karamo and Antoni] Bye!

14:53.100 --> 14:55.352
[upbeat music playing]

14:58.772 --> 15:01.358
[Bobby] I wanna help take Squee
to the next level,

15:01.442 --> 15:04.320
so the space not only works
for Sarah and her crew,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.071
but also for customers coming in the door.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.117
[Tan] Presentation is important.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.871
I'm not suggesting that
Sarah dress up in a prom outfit.

15:13.954 --> 15:18.709
But I want Sarah to feel empowered
to really be the face of this company.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.003
[Jonathan] My goal for Sarah
is to show her

15:21.086 --> 15:23.964
how she can have
a sustainable relationship with her hair.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.883
Something that makes her feel cute

15:25.966 --> 15:28.510
and that she doesn't wanna,
like, cover up underneath a hat

15:28.594 --> 15:31.305
because she kind of,
like, torched it with bleach.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.602
[Antoni] She clearly
has a grasp on her product.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.606
But I want Sarah to get to a place where
she's able to trust somebody to help her

15:41.190 --> 15:43.817
so that she can move on
and start to do other things.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.195
[Karamo] Sarah feels overwhelmed,

15:46.278 --> 15:48.489
and it's really important
for her to understand

15:48.572 --> 15:52.576
that she can reach out
and ask for help from the community.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.745
I want Sarah to know that she's not alone.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.666
[upbeat pop music playing]

16:08.634 --> 16:11.512
Well, I tell you, I really wanted
to spend some time with you first.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.763
Oh, thanks.

16:12.846 --> 16:16.266
Because I really wanna make sure
that as you're going on this journey,

16:16.350 --> 16:19.520
that you're able
to receive it in a positive way.

16:20.145 --> 16:24.066
We all deserve people to know
how we're feeling and what we need.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.194
And it seems as if
you really don't have that experience

16:27.277 --> 16:29.989
where you get to talk
about what you feel and need often.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.157
Uh, not so much. I mean, I…

16:33.117 --> 16:34.660
You know, like, I grew up in a family,

16:34.743 --> 16:37.287
we don't really, like,
talk about our feelings.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.707
It's just kind of like,
you just go about your day…

16:39.790 --> 16:42.584
-Yeah.
-It's just kind of how you operate.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.630
You said to me yesterday that there's
times that you just feel very overwhelmed?

16:47.214 --> 16:48.882
-Yes.
-Yeah, I get that.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.009
-Mm-hmm.
-I get that.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.261
What are you thinking?
I see you're getting emotional.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.471
Um, it's just hard. It's just…

16:55.639 --> 16:56.849
It's just, um…

16:58.392 --> 16:59.518
I… I need help.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.562
[sniffles]

17:03.814 --> 17:05.274
Just for somebody to…

17:07.067 --> 17:09.028
Just the fact that you're here…

17:10.320 --> 17:12.531
[sniffles] …um, it's…

17:16.076 --> 17:19.997
I don't wanna put the burden of everything
on Michael and Kelly all the time.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.001
Um, I just don't feel like
I have anybody else I can ask. [sniffles]

17:24.084 --> 17:27.212
I really want to help you
in figuring out how to get that support.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.465
There's a restaurant right here,

17:29.548 --> 17:32.009
and there's a gentleman inside
that I want you to meet.

17:32.092 --> 17:32.926
Okay.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.929
And he is a successful business owner.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.848
He has several restaurants,

17:37.931 --> 17:41.435
and he has had almost
a very similar experience to you.

-I want you to meet him.
-Okay, cool.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.315

-This is my friend C.K.

-Pleasure to meet you.
-So nice to meet you.

-You can sit right over there.
-Okay, thank you.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.874
I'm familiar with your space, your place.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.584
-[Sarah] Oh!
-And I've had your <i>taiyaki</i>.

-Oh, I'm glad you like it. Yeah.
-Yeah, of course.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.093
[Karamo] C.K. Chin, who's a pillar
in the restaurant community.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.095
He understands what Sarah's going through.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.431
As an Asian business owner,
he's been there. He's made it through.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.517
And it's time for Sarah
to meet with the community

18:21.600 --> 18:22.893
and understand she's not alone.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.979
There's nothing more connecting,
in my opinion, with food.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.524
You know, I have a Chinese restaurant
over here called Wu Chow.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.817
Yeah, I love your restaurant.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.111
Thank you.
I named it after my grandmother.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.656
But a large portion of why we even did it

18:35.739 --> 18:39.159
was because I wanted to share
with Austin a part of my culture.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.495
No matter what,
no matter how different I look,

18:41.578 --> 18:43.747
no matter how different I feel,
no matter anything,

18:43.831 --> 18:47.292
but when we share food and somebody goes,
"Man, this is delicious" or whatever.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.837
Then all of a sudden,
right away I can be like, "Yo."

18:49.920 --> 18:52.673
-[Sarah] Yeah.
-"We agree on something."

18:52.756 --> 18:54.633
[Sarah] That's kind of exactly how I felt.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.553
The business' identity
is wrapped up so much in mine because…

18:57.636 --> 18:59.805
-I make the menus. Yeah.
-[C.K.] It's you. Yeah.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.099
I started OMG Squee out of our house.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.309
I think all the best places
kind of start off like that.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.770
[laughs] A lot of what we do at OMG Squee

19:06.854 --> 19:10.440
is really just, like, a part of,
like, stuff that's nostalgic for me.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.152
Like, it reminds me of when I was a kid.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.987
My best friend in middle school
was Filipino,

19:15.070 --> 19:17.698
and we would, like, eat<i> halo-halo</i>
in her kitchen, you know, so…

19:17.781 --> 19:21.577
I just remember going to
just the one pan-Asian grocery store.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.619
-Yeah.
-[Sarah laughs]

19:22.703 --> 19:24.329
It's just, like, very nostalgic for me.

19:24.413 --> 19:28.000
So I also wanted to share stuff
that I couldn't find anywhere,

19:28.083 --> 19:30.836
things that, like,
other people didn't have.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.923
I love explaining to people, like, what
black sesame tastes like, for example.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.886
Um, after we moved out of our house,
kind of shared with the coffee shop,

19:38.969 --> 19:40.596
and then when they decided to move,

19:40.679 --> 19:43.056
we kind of were
sort of forced to assume the whole space.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.100
[chuckles]
So we weren't totally ready for that.

19:45.184 --> 19:49.730
-So either get ready or, you know, close.
-That's right.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.939
I know that feeling.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.568
We just did what we could,
built everything piece by piece.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.528
Three people run our entire restaurant.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.030
-It's been a lot.
-[Sarah] Yeah.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.491
There's something to be said about
the beauty in doing something difficult.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.952
I mean, I remember when I moved here,
it was super difficult.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.038
And it was very overwhelming.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.707
We didn't know what we were doing,
how we were gonna do it.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.711
But we really latched
onto this idea that we can,

20:12.794 --> 20:16.715
that we're good enough
and that we have enough passion for it.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.177
And in 30 seconds of talking with you,
you have the passion for it.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.680
You know, nobody talks
about sesame seeds… [splutters]

20:23.764 --> 20:25.974
-I love it so much. [laughs]
-…in a loving way.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.185
When I first found my tribe
of people that love cooking,

20:28.268 --> 20:29.937
I mean, we talk about salt.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.649
"Look at these different types of salt.
We got this<i> fleur de gris.</i> It's amazing."

20:33.732 --> 20:37.527
You know, and everyone is looking at us
like we're crazy, but that's the truth.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.947
Nice to have somebody to talk shop with.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.823
-Yeah, yeah.
-[C.K.] Oh, yeah.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.659
And if it gets heavy, ask for a spot.

20:43.742 --> 20:47.037
How often do you ask for a spotter
outside of the two people that you know?

20:47.621 --> 20:49.790
I don't have anybody to ask. [chuckles]

20:49.873 --> 20:51.667
[C.K.] Well, now you have me.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.002
-[laughs]
-[C.K.] You're part of the community.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.213
And the fastest way
to be part of that community is

20:56.296 --> 20:57.631
to reach out, communicate.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.424
If you have
a restaurant you enjoy going to,

20:59.508 --> 21:03.762
find out who the chef is there and say,
"Next time, I'm gonna bring you my food."

21:03.845 --> 21:06.056
You know,
because that's what we do for each other.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.558
When chefs go to restaurants,
we try to kill each other.

21:08.642 --> 21:12.229
-[laughing]
-We, like… We bombard them with food.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.898
Because that is
the language that we all speak.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.485
You decided to get up one morning,
cook food for people.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.237
-You're one of us. You're here.
-[laughs]

21:20.320 --> 21:23.490
You have a great product and wanting
to do better, wanting to do more,

21:23.573 --> 21:25.158
that's very much part of this tribe.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.286
-I don't want you to forget that either.
-Mm-hmm.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.413
That's why I love
this connection right here,

21:29.496 --> 21:34.126
because C.K. has been very generous
to say he'll be a spotter for you.

21:34.209 --> 21:37.045
So that you can feel and talk
about what you're going through.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.549
Because if you keep holding it in,
you're gonna feel buried.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.468
Um, I would agree. Yeah.

21:43.552 --> 21:48.181
I really appreciate you lending your
experience to things that I also feel. So…

21:48.265 --> 21:50.892
[Karamo] Sarah started baking
because it brought her joy.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.187
But somewhere along
the hustle and bustle, she lost the joy.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.106
But now's the moment for her to realize

21:56.189 --> 21:59.318
that any time she needs support
because she's feeling overwhelmed,

21:59.401 --> 22:02.571
there's people that she can reach out to
that wanna be there for her.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.449
We all have the one underlying thing
is that we're a bit of a workaholic.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.744
There's always work to be done.
Right now there's work for you to be done.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.746
-But this is important too.
-[Sarah] Yeah.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.956
So you need to make sure
that you make time for that.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.292
-And make time for yourself.
-[Sarah] Thank you for that.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.637
[Tan groans] Oh! This humidity.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.639
I know, it's hard. I have curly hair, so--

22:29.723 --> 22:33.352
That is my issue.
My hair could not be curlier.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.064
They're such tight curls, so it takes
so much to blow dry it all out.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.774
-Oh, yeah.
-It's a whole process.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.611
-Are you excited to shop?
-I'm very excited. Wow!

22:44.071 --> 22:46.656
Sarah really appreciates vintage.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.117
She loves '50s. She loves early '60s.

22:49.201 --> 22:53.080
She loves a fit and flare, and actually,
it really does fit in with OMG Squee.

22:53.163 --> 22:57.292
So, I know exactly what
I can do with her if that's her vibe.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.461
Tell me about you shopping.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.797
How often are you shopping?
Where are you shopping?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.549
I generally shop maybe, for myself,

23:05.675 --> 23:06.927
like, once a year.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.346
You don't need to look timid.
That's understandable.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.599
A lot of people don't have either
the time or the disposable income,

23:12.682 --> 23:14.267
especially when you're a business owner.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.061
Now, talk to me about body.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.397
Uh, well, I got a very big butt.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.606
-Okay.
-[laughs]

23:19.689 --> 23:22.484
-Do you mind if I ask you to turn around?
-Okay.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.736
You've got a really nice bum.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.114
Thank you.
I was hoping you would say that.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.325
I love a really full butt.
So yes, you've got a lovely bum.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.370
Yeah, I just have a hard time
finding clothes for it. [chuckles]

23:33.453 --> 23:34.287
Okay.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.205
Running the business,

23:35.288 --> 23:39.459
I had definitely had
some very extreme swings in my weight.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.129
Um, whenever we were starting,
I was extremely stressed.

23:42.212 --> 23:46.591
I think I lost, like,
40 pounds in, like, maybe five weeks.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.509
Wow, wow, wow. Okay.

23:47.592 --> 23:52.889
And then when COVID hit, it was like,
"Oh, yeah, COVID-30? COVID-40." Yeah.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.392
-Yeah.
-It makes it hard to shop for clothes.

23:55.475 --> 23:59.980
Yeah, this is why
it's so much more about how you feel.

24:00.063 --> 24:03.400
-We just wanna get to where we're happy.
-Yes.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.277
-Look in the mirror, please.
-Okay.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.528
[Tan] Okay. Good, good, good.

24:06.611 --> 24:10.949
So, you've got this baggy T on
that is hitting a pretty low spot.

24:11.032 --> 24:14.786
I would have loved it
if it was just a little bit more fitted.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.330
You've got a lovely
little hourglass going on.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.292
-[laughs] Thanks.
-You're just hiding it away.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.462
All I'm gonna do today
is try and get you to stop hiding away.

24:23.545 --> 24:27.507
I wanna walk into your establishment
and be like, "This bitch owns this place."

24:27.591 --> 24:28.425
[laughs] Yeah.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.802
"This is her business,
and she knows she's wicked."

24:30.886 --> 24:32.095
Let's show it off.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.681
I've got some items
in the fitting room for you already.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.516
-We're gonna give them a go.
-Okay.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.269
Even if you see them and think,
"Oh, I don't know," try it on.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.188
-Don't worry if it doesn't work.
-Sounds great.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.398
Great. Come with me.
The fitting room is just here.

24:43.482 --> 24:47.027
It's very clear that
Sarah has some body hang-ups

24:47.110 --> 24:49.988
that I wasn't expecting, quite honestly.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.699
-Are you ready?
-[Sarah] Yes, I'm ready.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.619
She's hiding away some of the things
that she doesn't feel good about.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.828
[Sarah laughs]

24:58.663 --> 24:59.664
Okay!

25:00.874 --> 25:02.751
-You can stand right there for me.
-Okay.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.295
[Tan] I'm gonna ask you
to do something controversial.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.840
I've not seen-- I've literally,
truly no idea what's under your hat.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.509
-So, can I have a look?
-Sure.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.843
-Yes!
-[laughs]

25:11.927 --> 25:13.094
It's a lot of hair.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.681
Oh, wow, it's so much longer
than I expected it to be. Okay.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.725
Oh, yeah. I got a lot of hair.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.353
[Tan] So, I would like
to know what you think.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.104
-I think the dress is cute.
-Yeah.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.524
Um, I like the top part the best.

25:25.607 --> 25:29.027
-Good.
-The skirt, I'm not feeling as much.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.321
[Tan] Would it be better
if it was shorter? Fuller?

25:31.404 --> 25:32.656
Maybe shorter.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.824
[Tan] Yeah? Show off a bit more leg.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.576
-Do you-- I love that.
-Um… [laughs]

25:36.660 --> 25:38.620
Do you usually go above the knee?

25:38.703 --> 25:41.790
-I usually hit right at my knee.
-Okay, good to know. That's helpful.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.376
-So, a little shorter. Yeah.
-Okay, okay, okay.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.585
Whenever I shop vintage,

25:45.669 --> 25:48.463
I always expect that
I'm gonna have to get things tailored.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.382
-Sure.
-It's never gonna be quite right.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.093
-So that's a really easy fix.
-I do really like this top part.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.010
I love the top part.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.428
If this were a top with jeans,

25:55.512 --> 25:57.847
it'd probably be something
I'd wear all the time.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.267
I love when somebody
is not a "yes person."

26:00.350 --> 26:03.061
I do not have yes people around me at all.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.900
-Bitch!
-[laughs]

26:08.984 --> 26:10.277
Sorry to swear at you.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.196
-Why do you think so? [laughs]
-You're hiding this shit away?

26:13.280 --> 26:14.281
Show me your ass.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.617
-Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
-[grunts]

26:17.701 --> 26:20.036
-I feel tall. That's nice.
-So nice.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.290
[chuckles] If I were dressing myself,
I probably wouldn't pair these together,

26:23.373 --> 26:25.292
but I might pair this with something else.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.168
So, this is a bathing suit.

I could find here that's so revealing

26:32.632 --> 26:34.551
compared to what you ordinarily wear.

26:34.634 --> 26:38.638

how rocking your body is.

at herself is lovely to see,

because she sees for the first time,
I think, in probably a long time,

26:52.110 --> 26:54.237
that she does have a banging body.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.073

I hope it fits. Isn't that so cute?

-Yes, this is very cute. Thank you.
-I love it so much! You're very welcome.

If you were to work in this

So, I've been baking alone all day.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.925
No, I'm kidding. Okay, so, Kelly was here.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.095
She was telling me that you're an artist.
You're a perfectionist,

28:00.178 --> 28:03.556
but it takes you a while to get to,
like, really trust somebody.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.141
-That's true, yes.
-[Antoni] Yeah.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.769
So you're gonna be the teacher,
and we're gonna be the students.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.771
-Oh, my gosh. Okay, cool.
-Yes!

28:10.355 --> 28:12.107

-She really is.

That's French for artist.

If you are the only technician

What you can achieve is finite.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.661
Whereas, if you are able
to delegate to other people,

28:24.744 --> 28:27.455
you can step out of that kitchen
and actually run your business.

28:43.555 --> 28:47.308
I've taught myself everything. I've made
every mistake anybody probably could make.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.978
Great. We're gonna introduce you
to a few more mistakes.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.813
-[Antoni] Yep! So, let's go.
-[laughing]

28:51.896 --> 28:56.067
So, uh, if you're
decorating them like I do, strawberry,

28:56.151 --> 28:57.527
just put a little glaze on it.

28:57.610 --> 28:58.611
[Tan] Same with the lemon?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.864
[Sarah] So, the lemon one,
I usually make it a bear.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.199
-[Tan] I love a good bear.
-[laughing]

29:03.283 --> 29:04.576
[Sarah] What I usually do

29:04.659 --> 29:07.245
is I will take a little bit
of the white chocolate in the piping bag

29:07.328 --> 29:09.330
and glue the little ears on.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.749
[Antoni] How's that distance?

29:10.832 --> 29:12.459
[Sarah] It's a little close,
but it's okay.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.044
Dip those. Just kiss on the top.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.881
[Tan] Okay, I've not given a kiss.
I've given a full-on full.

29:17.964 --> 29:20.383
[Antoni] I just saw yours,
and I feel a lot better about mine.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.468
[all laughing]

29:21.551 --> 29:26.473
[chuckles] Clearly, we are showing
that decorating a donut is not easy.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.516
[Antoni] That bear
has a great personality.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.393
-[Sarah] Mm-hmm.
-[laughing]

29:30.477 --> 29:32.687
-[Sarah] His mom thinks he's cool.
-[Antoni] His mom!

29:32.771 --> 29:34.063
[laughing]

29:34.147 --> 29:36.733
I think internally, she's probably
really, really disappointed.

29:36.816 --> 29:37.817
Screaming.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.987
But I hope she appreciates
the effort and the intention.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.490
[Sarah] Okay, I'm gonna help you
improve your piping technique.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.783
-[Tan gasps]
-[Antoni] Please.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.075
So, if you take the bag,

29:46.159 --> 29:49.788
you don't want too much in your hands
so it's not too rough on your wrist.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.999
So, you'll pipe it on like so. Oh!

29:53.082 --> 29:54.918
-[Tan] Oh, you do big dollops.
-[Antoni] Yep.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.044
[Sarah] Then that. Mm-hmm.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.421
One of the biggest ingredients
in baking is time.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.381
-Yeah.
-Waiting for things to dry.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.593
Waiting for things to do their thing,
you know, fun stuff.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.553
[Tan] It's clear
she wants to teach other people,

30:05.637 --> 30:07.263
and she's excited about the product.

30:07.347 --> 30:11.392
It blows my mind that Sarah did not bake
before starting OMG Squee.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.395
Hey, not for anything,
but I did a really good job with this one.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.730
That one is very pretty.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.941
-[Antoni] See? I'm teachable.
-[Sarah] I'm proud of you.

30:18.024 --> 30:21.903
You were a very patient,
very, very kind teacher.

30:21.986 --> 30:22.821
Oh, thank you.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.948
Anyone would be so lucky
to learn from you.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.408
-This will travel so well.
-[Antoni] Totally.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.328
So I thought it could be really cute
if we maybe box these up

30:30.411 --> 30:32.330
and then we go
to a couple of local businesses.

30:32.413 --> 30:34.040
Have them try 'em and see how they feel.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.124
-Okay.
-[Antoni] You know?

30:35.208 --> 30:37.252
In terms of outreach to the community.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.796
-I didn't know that was the plan? Great.
-We gotta sell these.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.632
Sarah and I are gonna head out,
and, um, you can clean up.

30:42.715 --> 30:43.967
Thanks so much, Tanny, buh-bye.

30:44.050 --> 30:45.969
-Thank you, Sarah, my love.
-[Sarah] Bye! Thanks!

30:47.011 --> 30:48.137
Well, this is fun.

30:48.221 --> 30:50.932
Isn't this fun? What an adventure.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.142
[laughs]

30:53.226 --> 30:57.063
Sarah's got an incredible product
that she's mastered over the years.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.815
She just has to get out
and show the world.

30:58.898 --> 31:01.734
We have a lot of flavors
that are, like, Asian-inspired,

31:01.818 --> 31:04.946
as well as, like, Texas-inspired,
you know, 'cause I'm a Texas girl.

31:05.029 --> 31:08.116
[Antoni] I think it's a great opportunity
to meet other local businesses,

31:08.199 --> 31:10.827
get her product out there,
introduce herself.

31:10.910 --> 31:11.786
[Sarah] Hello!

31:11.870 --> 31:14.205
-[woman] Oh, look how darling those are.
-Thank you.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.000
And also, she doesn't get to see
other people actually enjoying them,

31:17.083 --> 31:18.877
which is the point of her whole business.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.379
-[woman] It's so good.
-She wants to bring joy to people.

31:21.462 --> 31:23.089
-So nice meeting you.
-[woman] You too.

31:23.172 --> 31:25.425
-Have a good rest of your day.
-Take care. Cheers.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.427
I want Sarah to be a wild success

31:27.510 --> 31:30.221
so she can bring as much joy
to other people as she has for us.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.390
That was pretty painless.
You're good at this.

31:32.473 --> 31:33.600
[Sarah] Yeah, I'm excited.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.935
To get us out there as much as possible.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.562
-Whoo!
-[laughs]

31:42.567 --> 31:45.737
-All right, I got the wallpaper.
-[woman] Neat.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.363
[Bobby] I wanted to show you guys.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.033
-Do you think she'll like it?
-Yeah.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.785
-[Bobby] I wanna see some excitement!
-This is it.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.747
-[laughing]
-[Bobby] Get this out of the way.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.249
All right, I think Sarah's gonna love it.
This is great.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.085

32:05.214 --> 32:07.759

32:08.426 --> 32:11.012
-That was a loving go, not a serious one.
-Oh, that's okay.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.765
-So rainy. Hi! We made it.
-Hi!

32:14.807 --> 32:16.809
-[Jonathan] Let's go over here.
-[Sarah] Okay.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.645
-Take a seat.
-Thank you.

32:18.728 --> 32:22.148
Sarah, who gave you
permission to be so cute-ah?

32:22.231 --> 32:23.524
Are you giving me permission?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.609
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.320
But I never even needed to
because you gave it to yourself-ah.

-Hello.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.868

32:33.952 --> 32:35.662
-You and your head.
-[laughs]

32:35.745 --> 32:37.246
[Jonathan] Okay, so I have ideas.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.457
You had a fringe historically, right?

32:39.540 --> 32:40.792
Yes, I generally have bangs.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.834
It's kind of good.

32:41.918 --> 32:45.505
'Cause it gives you kind of like a look
even if you didn't really have time.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.465
-Yes.
-'Cause then you can just style that

32:47.548 --> 32:49.634
and then put the rest of it
underneath your beret.

32:49.717 --> 32:50.551
Yes.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.596
So I'm just gonna go ahead
and get started, just wanna jump right in.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.264
Yeah, I got a lot of hair.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.601
[Jonathan] Are you happy
always having to be in the back?

32:58.685 --> 33:01.187
-[Sarah] Not always, but…
-It just is what it is right now?

33:01.270 --> 33:03.856
-It is… It is what it is.
-It gives me burnout vibes.

33:03.940 --> 33:04.899
I just think, like,

33:04.983 --> 33:09.278
what can we do for you to get more
of what makes you really happy?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.405
Yeah.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.449
I think it's gonna require
getting some more people.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.036
It is hard to, like, let go of stuff

33:17.120 --> 33:20.248
when I've worked so hard
to get it to a level that I'm happy with,

33:20.331 --> 33:24.627
but I'm, like, ready to,
like, teach people what I do,

33:24.711 --> 33:27.422
and do what I like the best,
which is being creative.

that says fun, professional, chic. Yes!

Yeah! Get it! Get it!

33:48.860 --> 33:50.737
I'm excited to just get to work.

like, your first manicure moment?

33:54.073 --> 33:55.992
Oh, really? I've never done that.

33:56.075 --> 33:59.203
I know! So I got you a gorgeous manicure,
and this girl is, like, amazing.

does nail art like nobody's business.

-[Sarah] Oh, awesome.

34:15.803 --> 34:19.265
Yes, I actually risked it all
to go, like, during a snowstorm one time.

34:19.348 --> 34:21.100
-Did you really?
-[Paige] It was snowing.

34:21.184 --> 34:24.187
-I was like, "I don't care. I'm going."
-[Jonathan] The lemon donut does it?

34:24.270 --> 34:27.023
Oh, yes, the lemon one's my favorite.
I like the Hong Kong milk tea.

-That one's my favorite.

we have, like, same aesthetic. So…

-This is my first manicure.
-[gasps] Ever?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.869

-Stop. [laughs]

and admiration for what Sarah has done.

34:46.709 --> 34:49.921

and to have fun with her in the salon

34:50.004 --> 34:51.798
and make her feel gorgeous.

34:51.881 --> 34:54.133

34:54.217 --> 34:57.345
to do good hair
during quarantine, thank God.

to let her personality shine.
