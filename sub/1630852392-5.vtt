WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.520
We found a woman murdered
in a bathroom.

00:03.520 --> 00:05.720
A neighbour disturbed a number
of men inside the apartment.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.120
CROWD SHOUT

00:20.840 --> 00:22.320
I need you to get me out of here.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.120
The house?The country.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.880
I need to see someone who
can help us.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.040
I think I might have
put you in danger.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.520
What sort of danger?
I'm going to tell the police.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.600
I'm dead otherwise.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.960
A guy out walking
his dog found a body.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.240
It's him.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.680
Fionn Brannigan tried to put three
properties beyond our reach.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.400
But there was something
in Surat, too, that we didn't get.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.680
Surat.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.200
That's where I'd be looking.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.640
What have you got, Norah?

00:46.640 --> 00:49.640
If we get to this
Senne van Eyck's files,

00:49.640 --> 00:52.680
find a company in Surat he might
have done business with,

00:52.680 --> 00:55.720
we might get to Fionn.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.000
We have managed to extract
a sample of DNA.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.720
The bomber? Yes. He's Colombian.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.040
Four inmates in La Modelo prison.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.680
These poor bastards are easy
pickings for someone.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.920
Luca Rivera.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.320
He's on his way.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.680
Or he's already here.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.600
This prison, La Modelo, where
the men are being sourced...

02:34.960 --> 02:37.000
It's an absolute hell hole - look.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.520
Can't believe places
like this still exist.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.600
You don't even get a cell.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.680
You just find somewhere
in the filth and lie down.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.600
They are being exploited
by the people we really want.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.000
You may be right.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.560
And it seems getting them out
of there might not be that hard.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.640
Who's that one for?

02:56.640 --> 02:57.960
Whoever needs it most.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.280
That'd be me.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.920
Over a 100 dismembered bodies
were found

03:03.920 --> 03:05.840
in the drains a few years back.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.120
Inmates disposing of other inmates.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.240
None of them even logged as missing.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.920
Guess they were doing
the state a favour.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.960
The guards prosecuted all the time

03:15.960 --> 03:17.880
for taking bribes
to get prisoners out.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.800
It's the perfect hunting ground.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.640
So, we might know how
they're getting out of there,

03:22.640 --> 03:24.240
but not how they're getting in here.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.520
Mm-hm. Not a hit anywhere.
Nothing on facial recognition.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.160
PHONE RINGS

03:36.760 --> 03:38.200
Siobhan Brannigan is downstairs.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.280
She's here to ID her husband.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.000
She could know what he wanted
to tell us.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.240
She can't protect him any more.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.520
She'll be in no fit state
to be interviewed.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.560
And you're in a fit state to wait?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.440
HE SIGHS

04:15.520 --> 04:17.840
You sure you don't want
James to do this?

04:28.760 --> 04:30.120
Morning.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.200
If you could follow me, please.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.920
I'm very sorry for your loss,
Mrs Brannigan, Mrs Melnick.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.920
Can I have this?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.640
These will all be returned
to you in due course.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.440
Can... Can I see him?

05:48.480 --> 05:52.200
This is sufficient
for identification purposes.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.160
He has not been prepared
for a viewing.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.040
I'm sorry, Mrs Brannigan.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.440
Can you give him this?

06:15.440 --> 06:16.840
Of course.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.560
SHE CRIES

06:34.880 --> 06:36.840
Mrs Melnick.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.520
I'm so sorry, Siobhan.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.480
Can we have a word, please?

06:45.480 --> 06:47.000
Now is hardly the time.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.160
Maybe tomorrow. Call.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.160
Yeah, well, tomorrow might be
too late to prevent more deaths.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.080
Can we have a minute
to grapple with this one?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.920
Unless you want to make this formal?

06:55.920 --> 06:58.280
I don't... I don't want to go yet,
I want to go back in.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.760
I'll go with you. No. Please.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.440
Can I get you anything?

07:27.680 --> 07:31.480
You must have a lot of questions,
too, you want answered.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.640
Do you want to talk to
me without her?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.320
Why did he go to her, Siobhan?

07:45.040 --> 07:48.160
All that heat on him,
why risk a journey like that?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.880
He must have had a very good reason.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.800
You were hoping that
I could tell you?

08:03.040 --> 08:05.160
We think he was going
to hand himself in.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.280
Do you know what he was
going to tell us?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.520
No.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.160
It could help catch the bombers.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.400
I don't know.Clear his name.

08:16.400 --> 08:20.040
You don't want him associated
with that massacre forever, Siobhan.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.040
Or anything else.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.600
It's Mrs Brannigan.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.600
We're not friends.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.680
We need to take
a closer look at her.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.560
Siobhan?

08:45.560 --> 08:48.080
Her bank account has
even less in it than mine.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.400
Fionn has her well beyond reproach.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.880
No, Bibi Melnick.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.840
She HAS been cooperative.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.920
And ended up getting leaked
to the press, probably by us.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.760
Now she lost her brother
as well as her employee, Sana.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.400
I don't think you're going to get

09:04.400 --> 09:05.880
a warrant for her based on a hunch.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.880
You sound like Norah.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.440
Yeah, well, I like Norah.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.840
I really don't understand
why CAB are here.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.680
A terrorist case, a murder case

09:25.680 --> 09:28.440
and they're still looking
to see what they can get.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.760
What did she want?

09:32.640 --> 09:34.160
Would you eat?

09:34.160 --> 09:35.480
A juice, even?

09:35.480 --> 09:38.600
What did he want to say
to you, Bibi?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.080
It must have been important.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.520
He didn't tell me. He...

09:43.520 --> 09:45.600
He said he was going
to tell the police instead,

09:45.600 --> 09:47.520
and I'd be safer that way.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.800
What do you think it was?

09:51.240 --> 09:53.480
It sounded like...

09:53.480 --> 09:55.640
..he wanted to warn me
about something,

09:55.640 --> 09:58.440
but I have no idea what.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.600
You'd tell me, Bibi?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.560
I wish I did know.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.400
Aren't you worried?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.360
If he was warning you.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.320
I don't even know
what he was talking about.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.680
Are you worried?

10:24.240 --> 10:26.400
You know you can stay with us
as long as you want,

10:26.400 --> 10:28.080
or bring the kids over.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.280
Get you security,
if it makes you feel better.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.880
Anything you need.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.600
You shouldn't have left him...

10:34.600 --> 10:36.320
..on his own.

10:38.240 --> 10:39.720
I know.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.480
I really thought I was
doing the right thing.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.800
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.520
It's OK.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.840
PHONE VIBRATES

10:58.840 --> 11:01.120
Here, you sit in the car,
I'll take this.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.880
I said no.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.360
I need time.

11:13.360 --> 11:14.880
Don't call me again.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.840
So this Senne van Eyck was involved
with Brannigan's affairs in Surat?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.520
You're sure of this, Norah?

11:29.040 --> 11:30.480
I'm sure.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.840
Because we'd look very, very stupid
on a very big scale

11:32.840 --> 11:34.960
if you got this wrong. I'm sure.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.440
We find a company in Surat
that van Eyck has done work for

11:37.440 --> 11:40.600
and that company will lead us
right to, or one step closer to,

11:40.600 --> 11:42.240
Fionn Brannigan's money trail.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.600
And at some point
somewhere along this trail

11:44.600 --> 11:46.880
he either journeyed with
or crossed paths with

11:46.880 --> 11:48.480
the terrorists operating in Belgium.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.520
Then I will get the Belgian CTIF

11:54.520 --> 11:55.920
to expedite a search warrant.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.480
I'm so not sure, lads.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.880
Gately should be more worried
about finding a criminal

12:03.880 --> 12:05.720
than losing face.

12:05.720 --> 12:09.280
AND we know Brannigan
was totally dodgy.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.200
What sort of man hides files
on his kid's computer?

12:12.200 --> 12:13.680
What have you got?

12:13.680 --> 12:15.440
The one thing you don't
want to find.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.520
Evidence of the absence of evidence.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.880
What?

12:18.880 --> 12:22.480
This laptop recently utilised
an SB 1TB passport.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.680
An external hard drive.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.240
I can see that all the files
were transferred over

12:27.240 --> 12:29.240
and then wiped from
the internal hard drive.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.040
Not something you'd expect
an eight-year-old girl to be doing.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.800
He went to some lengths too.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.920
Overwriting the temporary files,

12:35.920 --> 12:39.200
which makes anything that was here
totally unrecoverable.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.360
But look at the time stamp.

12:42.560 --> 12:47.000
He did this right after
we paid him our first visit.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.240
So it's something he needed
to be sure we didn't see.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.760
But something he couldn't
destroy either.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.160
The only copy.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.880
But we've no idea what.

Who cried? Van Eyck?

20:46.880 --> 20:49.080
I think you're about
to hit the motherlode.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.840
SHE CHUCKLES

20:49.080 --> 20:50.840
See you.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.040
DOORBELL CHIMES

21:07.320 --> 21:09.600
Where are they? Mr Melnick,

21:09.600 --> 21:12.240
I told you on the phone,
they don't wish to be disturbed.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.640
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.520
How are you?

21:17.520 --> 21:18.840
Take this, please.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.880
That was really something you had
to go through this morning, huh?

21:23.880 --> 21:25.920
And how's Siobhan?She's resting,

21:25.920 --> 21:28.280
which is why we're
trying to be quiet.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.680
Ah, good, good.
I'm going to take a bath.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.560
Indulge me for a bit, please.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.000
I really don't have it in me
right now, Richard. I'm sorry.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.440
All right, all right. I just want
to know that you're OK.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.520
No.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.160
Well, then, maybe you can take

21:43.160 --> 21:44.720
a little time off work
after this, huh?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.560
Yeah. I'll need a few days.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.360
Everybody happy?

21:54.480 --> 21:57.000
I'm sorry that I
interrupted you two.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.880
Chesa!

21:58.880 --> 22:01.360
My father needs his coat.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.720
When are you coming back?

22:10.720 --> 22:13.800
Soon. When's Daddy coming back?

22:14.880 --> 22:18.000
What will I bring you?
Chocolate, iPhone, Red Dead.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.560
OK, Mummy has to go now.

22:22.560 --> 22:23.960
Bye. Love you.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.040
SHE CRIES

22:38.120 --> 22:39.520
Hi.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.160
Just wanted to check in on you.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.640
Look, Siobhan, I want you to know

22:46.640 --> 22:49.520
you and the kids are going to
have nothing to worry about.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.720
No matter how much damage CAB do.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.800
I know my dad would want
that for his grandkids.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.360
And for Fionn.

23:05.040 --> 23:08.920
I'm going to propose a
yearly income of 350,000, OK?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.080
And I'll always be here for you.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.520
SIREN WAILS

23:24.880 --> 23:27.640
KNOCK ON DOOR

23:40.640 --> 23:41.800
Thanks!

23:49.200 --> 23:50.640
Eat.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.960
At least one of us gets something.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.920
I hear you cleaned up.Hmm.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.920
Not bad for a paper pusher, huh?

24:00.920 --> 24:02.280
SHE CHUCKLES

24:02.280 --> 24:05.920
No, Norah's the one now
doing all the real damage.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.080
Those files won't hide a thing.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.160
I'm a fucking disaster.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.960
I got angry at Mila and...

24:15.720 --> 24:18.360
..I didn't even wait to see
if that guy's ID checked out.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.320
You know...

24:23.520 --> 24:26.600
..I've dealt with a lot of
homicides over the years,

24:26.600 --> 24:28.600
and you can't help
but take that home.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.480
I can't imagine what it's like,
dealing with multiple deaths.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.000
Oh, God!

24:38.000 --> 24:40.080
Oh, shit!

24:38.000 --> 24:40.080
SHE LAUGHS

24:43.480 --> 24:44.760
Here.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.320
Yeah, thanks.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.600
Oh, my God, you're smoking!

24:54.600 --> 24:56.680
Yeah, well, you caught me.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.560
HE SIGHS

25:06.320 --> 25:11.320
You know, if this was Ireland,
I'd be denouncing you

25:11.320 --> 25:14.040
for inappropriate behaviour
in the workplace.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.360
Yeah!

25:15.360 --> 25:16.960
Have your office by the weekend.

25:18.320 --> 25:19.840
I believe you would.Mm-hm.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.320
You sure you want another
one of these?

25:25.320 --> 25:27.600
You seeing anything?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.640
I'm seeing double at this point.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.720
Is that everything Emer sent us?

25:31.720 --> 25:33.240
Yup.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.560
There just isn't a Surat link.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.920
What's Gately going to say?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.800
There isn't a single connection

25:41.800 --> 25:45.280
between any company van Eyck
ever did work for in Surat.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.000
What was I even thinking?

25:50.520 --> 25:52.440
You need sleep, Norah.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.800
We'll look at this again
tomorrow with fresh eyes.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.600
OK? No.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.960
We look at it till
we find something.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.920
Anything.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.360
PHONE RINGS

26:04.720 --> 26:07.360
Oh.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.280
Hello? We've had a look,

26:12.280 --> 26:13.760
and there's nothing there.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.840
There's nothing on the files
that connects to Surat?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.120
No, nothing.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.240
Look, I'll call you back.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.720
OK. Thanks.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.640
Norah needs my help.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.160
You can use my computer, feel free.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.360
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.720
Got them?

26:32.720 --> 26:34.360
In front of me now.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.800
First file up is 2009 -

26:36.800 --> 26:40.000
the year Fionn Brannigan
started travelling to Surat.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.520
We concentrated our search there
and two years either side.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.240
Nothing.

26:44.240 --> 26:47.280
And not a thing right up
until the present day.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.400
What are you doing here?
I thought you clocked out already.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.440
Josh said you needed all
hands on deck.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.080
Of course I'm here!

26:55.840 --> 26:57.080
Boss!

27:00.520 --> 27:03.960
I don't think van Eyck
is going to give us Fionn Brannigan.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.800
I made a bad call, Emer.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.800
It's too early to call that, Norah.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.240
Let's just go over it all again.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.160
Come on, Arthur. Time for bed.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.640
What's that, Mammy?

27:27.280 --> 27:29.120
Nobody.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.400
Bed.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.920
Maybe there's a different
connection, Norah.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
Between what and what, though?

27:48.920 --> 27:51.720
There's dozens of companies
and hundreds of policies here.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.840
If we don't have Surat
to anchor our search, then what?

27:54.840 --> 27:58.480
We just randomly look at data?
Companies?

27:58.480 --> 28:01.120
Culain sounds Irish.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.040
Maybe that's a bit TOO random, Josh.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.960
SHE SIGHS

28:08.360 --> 28:10.200
Hang on.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.280
What?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.480
Shit! What?

28:14.480 --> 28:16.760
He didn't!

28:16.760 --> 28:18.800
There's no way
he could be that stupid.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.920
They're always
that stupid eventually.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.760
What have you got, Sean?
I'm sending it over.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.080
I sat looking at it
for long enough.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.040
Look.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.760
It's the entrance
to Fionn Brannigan's house.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.560
And look what he's called it.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.880
I don't get it. It's Irish.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.880
"House of Culain."

28:39.880 --> 28:41.800
He named the company
after his house.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.520
Stupidity and a big ego.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.600
That's what always
gets these guys caught.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.200
Let's take a look at Culain then.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.880
Emer, I'm sending you
the Culain file now.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.640
PHONE CHIMES

28:55.160 --> 28:56.640
See it?

28:59.120 --> 29:01.040
Hmm.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.440
Culain's paying premiums in Surat.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.280
And I tell you something else -

29:05.280 --> 29:08.920
Fionn Brannigan isn't
the brains behind that.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.320
He was getting help

29:10.320 --> 29:12.000
from someone a lot smarter than him.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.400
DOG BARKS

30:22.520 --> 30:23.960
Bibi.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.400
Bibi!

30:29.080 --> 30:32.000
Wait, are you going to work?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.640
Yeah. I have to.
Koshinen sprang a fuel leak.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.040
A fuel leak?

30:37.080 --> 30:39.760
Destroyed his reserve stock.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.240
Come on, I'm sure they can
manage without you for one day.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.000
Today of all days.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.520
If it wasn't Koshinen -
he's my biggest client.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.040
Mammy, Mammy,
Auntie Siobhan is leaving.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.440
Stay with your dad. Why?

30:56.080 --> 30:57.480
Let's go play.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.680
Siobhan, what's going on?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.040
I need to be with my children.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.280
OK.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.160
If you wait a few hours,
we'll get you a flight.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.760
I've got a flight.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.960
I'd like to take my money now.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.120
We don't have that kind
of money here.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.520
Then we can stop by the bank.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.280
I have to go to work.
Then we'll stop on the way.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.040
Siobhan, what's going on?

31:22.040 --> 31:24.920
And I want more
than what you offered me.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.600
The money is tied up in the system.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.640
Then find it.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.480
I want out.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.000
And I want Fionn's full share.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.040
I know how much it is
and it's nowhere close to what
you offered me last night!

31:36.040 --> 31:37.720
Keep your fucking voice down.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.280
James doesn't know
you're laundering.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.240
I protect him from that.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.920
Fionn obviously protected
you from plenty.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.800
Thanks, Mila.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.520
We've got something.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.000
You've been here all night?Mm-hm.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
This Senne van Eyck
has a specie insurance policy

32:18.000 --> 32:21.440
on his books
covering diamond shipments.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.760
They're in and out of a
diamond cutting house in Surat.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.640
The premium is paid by a Cayman
Islands company called Culain.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.440
Guess who founded Culain?

32:30.440 --> 32:32.520
Fionn Brannigan?

32:32.520 --> 32:33.960
Bibi Melnick.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.160
Now we get a warrant.

32:38.160 --> 32:41.440
Chef, Kamal Mersi is downstairs.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.320
He asked for you specifically.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.480
Dr Mansour said to talk to you.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.600
She said she thought
I could trust you.

32:59.840 --> 33:03.800
Look, I just...don't want my friends
to get into trouble because of me.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.560
Not if you help us.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.640
And we think you know
things that could.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.920
Sana?

33:13.320 --> 33:15.640
She didn't do anything wrong.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.800
She just...

33:18.280 --> 33:20.720
..wanted to learn Flemish and...

33:20.720 --> 33:22.400
..become a music teacher.

33:24.520 --> 33:27.240
The night she died,
you were on shift together?

33:28.800 --> 33:31.160
She wanted to stay late.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.160
She used to sneak into the
office if no-one was around,

33:34.160 --> 33:36.240
to use the computer,

33:36.240 --> 33:39.400
Skype her family in Syria.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.040
I said I'd wait for her.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.000
But she insisted I go home.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.800
She was calling me
when she was leaving.

33:48.800 --> 33:49.920
She thought...

33:51.080 --> 33:53.560
Wait. I...

33:53.560 --> 33:55.160
I'll play it for you.

33:57.280 --> 34:03.120
PHONE CALL PLAYS

34:16.640 --> 34:19.600
She saw something strange
when she left work...

34:21.160 --> 34:24.000
..when everyone
was supposed to be gone.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.200
And she wishes she'd left with me.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.400
She has two creepy men
too close behind her.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.600
I should have stayed.
I should have stayed.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.280
Um...

34:39.280 --> 34:41.280
..you can hear her
run for her bus.

34:44.240 --> 34:46.720
She promises to call me
as soon as she's home.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.440
But she never did.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.560
I drove to her hostel, I drove
her route home. Nothing.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.560
And when I got back to my place,

35:01.560 --> 35:03.080
I saw two men inside...

35:03.080 --> 35:04.400
..waiting.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
I knew it was them.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.200
Can you describe them?

35:08.200 --> 35:10.040
I didn't stick around.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.760
And then what?

35:12.760 --> 35:14.280
And then, the next morning,

35:14.280 --> 35:16.800
Sana's death is all over the papers

35:16.800 --> 35:18.720
and you guys want me
for the Antwerp bomb.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.320
So I ran...

35:20.320 --> 35:22.400
..and hid. What would you do?

35:32.160 --> 35:36.040
Yeah, Mila, could you
go back to the port CCTV

35:36.040 --> 35:39.520
on the night of the 17th
and locate Sana?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.880

I can't do anything with those.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.040
I want polished,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.480
with certificates.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.720
Hurry up, Bibi.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.320
That's twice you've tried
to fob me off.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.600
I'm not trying to fob...
Get the polished ones.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.000
What's this?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.800
That's Fionn's full share
for next month.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.000
I want Fionn's
full share for forever.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.440
Take it in instalments, Siobhan.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.240
This is my father's money.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.040
We don't want to lose it all
again by drawing attention.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
Bibi, all you need to do right now

37:53.600 --> 37:56.360
is give me a good reason
not to give this to CAB.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.440
Every detail of you
and Fionn's entire system.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.320
You're implicated too.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.360
Fionn never implicated me
in anything.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.320
Only you and him.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.320
And he's dead.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.280
You'll never get them out
of the country.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.720
I've made arrangements, thank you.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.160
I'm sorry it's come to this.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.920
Oh, fuck off, Bibi!

38:48.880 --> 38:51.440
CCTV from this camera was corrupted.

38:51.440 --> 38:55.880
Vince was waiting on news from IT,
but I managed to recover the data.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.840
And I've found Sana.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.240
And she wasn't alone.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.840
Then, where did she go?

39:12.840 --> 39:14.520
It's all we have.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.600
She didn't make it
to the bus stop camera.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.360
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

39:57.560 --> 40:00.440
PHONE RINGS

40:06.000 --> 40:09.480
INDISTINCT SPEECH

40:09.480 --> 40:11.960
No. It's too dangerous now.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.000
After dark.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.920
Yes.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.080
Like I said, I...

40:48.080 --> 40:49.680
..I barely saw them but...

40:49.680 --> 40:51.600
Yeah, tall like that.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.560
Hang on, did you see that?

41:00.440 --> 41:01.920
Look.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.680
Look at that.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.960
What's Bibi Melnick doing there?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.520
Must be 4:00 in the morning.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.920
OK. Go back, check when she arrived.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.360
Everywhere.

41:16.360 --> 41:17.960
This woman is everywhere.

41:19.760 --> 41:22.280
There. 40 minutes earlier.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.000
Close in.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.360
Bibi Melnick brought these men?

41:37.480 --> 41:40.440
Or she's being followed too.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.720
She's not the one dead in a bathtub.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.480
Port or house? She's at the port.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.440
She used her alpha pass
20 minutes ago.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.000
OK.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.840
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

42:24.720 --> 42:26.960
I'm sorry about your brother.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.200
Thank you.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.400
Sir, according to her alpha pass,

42:33.400 --> 42:36.920
Bibi Melnick was in the port
the night before the Brussels bomb

42:36.920 --> 42:38.360
as well as the Antwerp one.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.120
There's also a ship

42:40.120 --> 42:42.200
that was present in the port
on both dates.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.000
And is it there now?

42:44.000 --> 42:46.800
According to the log,
it came in yesterday.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.960
It's her.

42:48.960 --> 42:51.800
Oh, my God! She's the one
bringing the bombers in.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.720
Copy that.

43:11.720 --> 43:14.640
Sana must have seen her and
Bibi Melnick had her killed.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.760
She's been right
in front of us the whole time.

43:16.760 --> 43:21.040
Bibi must have seen the call
to Kamal on Sana's phone...

43:21.040 --> 43:22.800
..and sent them after him.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.680
Come on. Get up.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.320
Hurry up!

44:36.760 --> 44:38.200
In! In, in.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.520
Shit! That was her. Turn around.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.280
What?Turn around!

45:12.280 --> 45:13.960
Fuck!

45:15.600 --> 45:20.080
BEEPING

45:20.080 --> 45:21.680
Come on! Open, open, open!

45:21.680 --> 45:24.320
COUGHING AND BANGING

45:21.680 --> 45:24.320

45:24.320 --> 45:26.800
Open up!

45:24.320 --> 45:26.800
BEEPING

45:26.800 --> 45:29.080
Can I help you, Mrs Melnick?

45:29.080 --> 45:30.120
Thank you!

45:36.120 --> 45:37.560
Fuck!

45:46.560 --> 45:49.280
SIREN BLARES

45:51.240 --> 45:52.880

45:52.880 --> 45:55.400
PHONE RINGS

45:58.600 --> 46:00.800
You are being
followed, Mevrouw Melnick...

46:00.800 --> 46:02.240
..by police.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.920
Shit!

46:03.920 --> 46:06.640
Get rid of them.
That's what you're paid for.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.480
Shit!

46:08.480 --> 46:10.920
Shit! Are you listening?

46:10.920 --> 46:12.800
This is what you need to do.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.640
I need a minute. Mevrouw...

46:18.240 --> 46:19.880
Listen to me!

46:19.880 --> 46:22.800
You are out of time.
You need to keep moving.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.560
They are closing on you.

46:25.560 --> 46:28.280
Mevrouw! I'm listening.

46:31.160 --> 46:33.360
Just keep going.
She can't have got far.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.080
He's in the car now.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.840
That's why she was in work

46:36.840 --> 46:38.720
the day after she ID'd
her dead brother.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.320
The day this ship was in port.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.880
He's in the car!

46:47.760 --> 46:49.080
Shit!

47:03.120 --> 47:04.880
OK. Get ready.

47:08.720 --> 47:10.280
Now.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.800
Come on!Do not lose her! Come on!

47:20.960 --> 47:24.080
Fuck!Don't lose her. Come on! Fuck!

47:24.080 --> 47:26.040
HORN BEEPS, SIREN BLARES

47:28.920 --> 47:31.200
SHE EXHALES DEEPLY

47:36.640 --> 47:39.320
This guy's got to
be working for her.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.600
Fuck it!

47:40.600 --> 47:42.440
All units to stop a black Audi

47:42.440 --> 47:45.400
Uniform Whiskey Zulu
7-9-1 travelling south.

47:45.400 --> 47:48.160
We have to go after Melnick.
I don't see her.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.800
I want a chopper in the air.
We cannot lose her.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.520
Already on its way, boss.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.120
There! There she is!

47:57.120 --> 47:59.120
HORN BEEPS, TYRES SCREECH

47:59.120 --> 48:01.760

on route 29.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.800
Tell me we have units
in place, Mila.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.520
Just checking that now.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.560
Fuck!

48:23.200 --> 48:24.920
Get out of the car!

48:24.920 --> 48:27.040
