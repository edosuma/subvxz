00:01.334 --> 00:03.128
Previously on Prison Break...

00:03.253 --> 00:04.462
From now on, I'm asking

00:04.629 --> 00:06.798
that everyone
keep their card on them.

00:06.881 --> 00:08.008
At all times.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.718
Gretchen didn't get us
the sixth card.

00:09.801 --> 00:10.719
Where does that leave us?

00:10.802 --> 00:11.845
You know, Gretchen did pass on

00:11.928 --> 00:13.638
this one piece of
information for you.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.724
It's gonna be helpful.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.353
I got a call from an old friend,
heard Scylla was

00:20.437 --> 00:21.563
in play and he wants to know

00:21.646 --> 00:23.106
if he can get in on it.
I've set up a safe house

00:23.189 --> 00:24.357
where we can hear him out.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.900
-Do you have a pen?
-Just a minute.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.111
1917 Piermont.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.198
Agent Self...

00:33.575 --> 00:34.868
we've been waiting.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.077
When Scofield
and Burrows walk

00:36.161 --> 00:37.704
through the door,
give them

00:37.787 --> 00:38.830
an opportunity to surrender.

00:38.913 --> 00:39.998
There's no way
they're gonna

00:40.081 --> 00:41.416
hand it over
without a fight.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.961
If they take that position,
we'll respond in kind.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.547
We make one wrong move,

00:48.673 --> 00:51.760
the camera goes on and General
Krantz knows we're inside.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.770
I need a team downstairs now!

01:25.210 --> 01:26.586
Shouldn't be long.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.091
You sure we shouldn't
be waiting down there

01:31.174 --> 01:33.051
for Michael to leave
with Scylla.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.136
If you knew anything
about tactics,

01:35.220 --> 01:36.930
you would know
that this is the high ground.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.057
Besides, we have silencers.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.321
So, Scylla isn't one card.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.156
It's six.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.832
Make sure he's not armed
with explosives.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.083
Then kill him.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.807
Drop 'em.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.892
Or I blow his head clean off.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.438
You're gonna want
to put that down.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.360
You're gonna want
to put that down.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.281
Lower your weapons.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.617
Come on. Get over there.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.620
Come on, old man.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.587
The best minds in the world
designed this security system,

02:50.670 --> 02:53.089
and you almost beat it.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.343
The frustration
must be killing you.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.220
You blew it.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.347
Actually...

03:01.431 --> 03:04.642
there's only one missing piece
of the puzzle...

03:04.726 --> 03:06.769
and you just brought it to me.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.607
I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.525
Your Scylla card.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.444
Now.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.580
Not what you expected?

04:07.664 --> 04:08.915
What I expected

04:08.998 --> 04:11.084
of a man like you is a system

04:11.167 --> 04:15.004
where you've got
all the advantage.

04:19.842 --> 04:23.179
Looks like you're
a few cards short.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.359
Suck it, General.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.374
You're the worst partner
I've ever worked with.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.750
What?
Leaving me

04:52.834 --> 04:54.085
with the one-handed freak

04:54.168 --> 04:55.628
and crazy bitch,
while you hang out

04:55.712 --> 04:56.879
with GQ...
Be quiet.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.548
Be quiet. Be quiet.
Don't tell me what to do!

04:58.631 --> 05:00.300
You're a coward!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.467
Listen to me.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.970
You think Gretchen and Bagwell
are gonna get you Scylla,

05:04.053 --> 05:05.430
but the people
they're gonna steal it from

05:05.513 --> 05:06.472
have a plan

05:06.556 --> 05:07.807
Shut up!
to trick them...

05:07.890 --> 05:09.017
-You shut up!
-Don't tell me

05:09.100 --> 05:10.184
-to shut up!
-Okay, be quiet.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.269
Don't tell him anything!

05:11.352 --> 05:12.353
I can tell whatever I want!

05:12.437 --> 05:13.313
-Be quiet!
-Don't tell me

05:13.396 --> 05:14.314
-to shut up!
-Hey! Hey!

05:26.492 --> 05:28.202
Hey!

05:28.286 --> 05:29.454
Don't!

05:45.762 --> 05:47.972
-We needed him.
-He was going to kill you.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.515
All right, just go get
Gretchen and Bagwell.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.934
I'm gonna take care of this.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.856
Cole,

05:56.939 --> 05:59.400
you ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.445
I don't know how things
worked back home,

06:02.528 --> 06:03.696
but around here, we like to give

06:03.780 --> 06:06.074
our guest
a proper introduction.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.825
I'm Gregory White.
Nice to meet you.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.035
Susan Anthony.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.787
I've seen you around
the past couple of days.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.497
Are you a prospective client?

06:12.580 --> 06:15.208
Actually, no, I am a former
work colleague of Cole's.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.377
She's a pretty convincing
salesman herself.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.461
Really?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.296
Where did you work together?

06:22.757 --> 06:24.258
Florida.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.761
Florida?

06:26.844 --> 06:28.638
Weren't you
in the Northeast division?

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
I was.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.392
But my very first job
with GATE was, uh,

06:32.475 --> 06:33.851
in Clearwater.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.522
I guess you don't like
to stay put much, do you?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.441
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.945
Well, it was, uh, wonderful
to meet you. I, uh...

06:44.028 --> 06:47.949
I have to go jump
on a conference call.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.498
He knows.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.255
No. No.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.049
No.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.467
What's she doing!?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.056
Hey!

07:15.726 --> 07:18.020
Hang it up.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.730
Please, that way.
Right in Mr. White's office.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.649
Everybody just stay calm.
Mr. White's office!

07:21.732 --> 07:22.817
Sit!

07:22.900 --> 07:23.860
Now listen very closely!

07:23.943 --> 07:26.154
No one's gonna get hurt.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.322
Now what?

07:38.207 --> 07:39.876
How...

07:39.959 --> 07:42.003
did you get all five cards?

07:42.086 --> 07:45.381
The frustration
must be killing you.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.446
Is that...?

08:08.529 --> 08:09.572
What is that?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.408
The cards were keys...

08:13.367 --> 08:16.370
...and this...

08:16.454 --> 08:19.290
this is Scylla.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.918
Guess right now you wish
you'd framed

08:22.001 --> 08:23.336
somebody else,
huh, General?

08:23.419 --> 08:28.633
You're not even close
to getting out of here.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.843
Let's go.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.976
You sure, Papi?

08:39.060 --> 08:40.561
We have no idea what's waiting
for us back there.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.230
Yeah, but we don't know
what's be up there either.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.648
Trust me.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.650
General, we're gonna
need you

08:45.733 --> 08:48.069
to activate
this elevator.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.331
Best of luck.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.293
You're coming
with us.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.476
It's all right, Damani.
Put away the gun.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.186
Everything's under control.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.450
We have a major situation.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.211
Michael, thank God.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.338
We got it.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.675
How's it going on your end?

09:52.758 --> 09:53.801
Pretty damn good.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.262
But give me five more minutes.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.710
♪ ♪

10:29.462 --> 10:30.588
Is that the desk

10:30.671 --> 10:32.923
you sat at when you told Wyatt
to kill my son?

10:33.924 --> 10:35.343
Don't worry, Alex.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.387
He won't be giving
any more orders after today.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.974
I'm curious.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.934
How do you think
you're getting out of here?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.395
The second

10:46.479 --> 10:47.521
we stepped off the elevator,

10:47.605 --> 10:50.608
my guard made a call to put the
entire building under lockdown.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.195
Nothing gets in or out.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.157
So whatever
you're waiting for--

10:58.532 --> 11:00.493
it isn't coming.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
♪ ♪

12:10.312 --> 12:11.355
What are you
looking at, huh?

12:11.439 --> 12:12.481
Nothing. Nothing.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.649
Huh? What are
you looking at?!

12:13.733 --> 12:14.817
Nothing.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.280
Don't you be eyeballing me,
soldier.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.448
Back to work.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.454
There's no way
this is gonna end well.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.748
We should get
out of here.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.877
Don't you think it's worth
20 minutes for $125 million?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.545
Suck it up!

12:37.923 --> 12:39.800
I want a team
outside of the General's office.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.594
We need to get a handle on this.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.762
Check the elevator.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.223
Cover the stairwell.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.440
All that design just
to hold some names and reports.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.442
Names and reports?

12:57.318 --> 13:00.321
Is that information
from the government,

13:00.404 --> 13:02.698
or your father?

13:04.241 --> 13:05.326
Careful.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.370
Top right-hand drawer.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.540
It's something that should be
of interest to you.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.211
I pulled it
when your names came up.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.297
Why did you leave?

13:18.380 --> 13:19.423
I took a position

13:19.507 --> 13:21.300
with a group of
multinationals we call

13:21.383 --> 13:22.802
the Company.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.137
They call every shot
this country takes.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.933
I knew your father
since before you were born.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.393
You do know he worked
for the Company?

13:31.477 --> 13:34.480
Yeah. He was a data analyst.

13:34.563 --> 13:37.233
Is that what he told you?

13:37.316 --> 13:39.777
Well, it makes sense.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.071
He wanted to protect you
from the truth.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.531
I'm warning you.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.741
Your father was a brilliant man,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.536
but he could never
have defeated the Company.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.704
You don't have
to make the same

13:50.788 --> 13:54.416
misguided, fatal mistake
that he did.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.503
There's so much you don't know
about the Company...

13:57.586 --> 13:59.505
about Scylla...

13:59.588 --> 14:01.465
about your dad...

14:01.549 --> 14:03.008
about your mother.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.510
I swear to God,
I'll kill you.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.223
Let's get through this.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.769
What's the plan?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.241
Agent Self?

14:27.324 --> 14:28.409
Where are we?

14:28.492 --> 14:30.035
The men went in
about two hours ago.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.745
No confirmation on
whether they've gotten Scylla?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.539
Not yet,
but I promise you, Herb,

14:33.622 --> 14:35.374
you'll be the first
to know, okay?

14:35.457 --> 14:37.835
And as soon as I get word,
I'm taking an unmarked car

14:37.918 --> 14:39.712
to the pickup location, and then
I'm gonna head back over...

14:39.795 --> 14:42.464
No. You go directly
to Senator Dallow's office.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.842
I'll have the attorney general
standing by.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.552
We can't veer
from the plan here.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.636
It's too dangerous.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.804
Yes, sir.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.181
We're almost at
the finish line.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.475
I know.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.313
I never thought
you'd make it this far.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.273
I was wrong.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.571
We need to be prepared to go in

15:05.654 --> 15:07.740
as soon
as the General gives the order.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.433
What is it you all want?

15:36.226 --> 15:37.269
Fernando.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.354
Just say the word,

15:38.437 --> 15:39.605
and your little girl's

15:39.688 --> 15:41.106
college education
is paid for.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.733
We'll buy her a house
to grow up in.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.234
You think you can just

15:44.318 --> 15:45.778
throw some cash at us, huh?

15:45.861 --> 15:48.238
We'll forget everything,
call it a day?

15:48.322 --> 15:51.075
Pam needs you, Alex.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.285
Now more than ever.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.454
You're both
still hurting,

15:55.537 --> 15:57.581
but given time,
it'll pass.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.999
And maybe some day
you'll be ready

15:59.083 --> 16:02.002
to be parents again, and
if money is no object...

16:02.086 --> 16:04.546
You should hear yourself
right now.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.007
The desperation
in your voice.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.008
You hear it?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.969
But listen to what
it is I'm saying.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.220
Get away from me.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.304
Whatever you want...

16:12.388 --> 16:13.806
Get away from me.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.267
Whatever you want,

16:17.351 --> 16:19.645
I can provide.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.399
Airline tickets

16:23.482 --> 16:25.275
for you and Sara
anywhere in the world.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.820
What I want

16:27.903 --> 16:30.239
is to see The Company
burn to the ground,

16:30.322 --> 16:32.783
and you in prison.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.662
It's what we all want.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.958
That'll never happen.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.547
Hi. How have you been?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.298
Fine.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.175
Good.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.179
Oh. Oops.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.848
I am so sorry.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.932
Back off.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.267
Excuse me.
Let me help you

16:58.350 --> 16:59.351
get some of
that off.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.853
You know what? Stop. Just...

17:01.937 --> 17:03.313
Ugh!

17:03.397 --> 17:05.649
Don't worry about it.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.194
Are you okay?
Excuse me, gentlemen.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.071
Thank you.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.122
Damn it.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.298
Shh.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.718
Everybody get into position.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.847
This is going to end

17:36.930 --> 17:40.684
very soon,
and it's not going to be pretty.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.395
One last chance.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.899
Leave Scylla, and you can all

17:46.982 --> 17:48.734
go free.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.696
Just walk out the door.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.203
Where are
you going?

17:59.286 --> 18:02.122
You shoot me,
and then what?

18:02.206 --> 18:05.918
You jump out the window
of my 19th floor office?

18:06.001 --> 18:09.713
Michael, you kill me,
you lose your leverage.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.803
Hello?

18:20.307 --> 18:22.392
It's for you.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.895
Oh, what is this?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.814
Leverage.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.233
It's me.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.943
Lisa?

18:32.820 --> 18:34.905
I'm at gunpoint.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.116
What's going on?

18:37.199 --> 18:38.200
It's Tancredi.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.535
She says if you don't

18:39.618 --> 18:43.080
let Michael and the others leave
with Scylla, she'll kill me.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.710
Dad?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.840
Please.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.970
Do what they want.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.351
I suggest you take
your daughter's advice, General.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.145
You son of a bitch.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.279
Lisa, where you are?

19:15.362 --> 19:16.655
Get her back on the phone!

19:16.738 --> 19:19.158
You can talk to your daughter
after we've left

19:19.241 --> 19:20.909
with Scylla, of course.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.164
Look, I read enough intel
on your girlfriend

19:25.247 --> 19:27.332
to know
that she wouldn't hurt a fly.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.710
Maybe... three months ago,

19:29.793 --> 19:33.172
but she's changed.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.549
We've all changed.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.844
This is a list of
everyone you've killed.

19:38.927 --> 19:43.223
Fathers, sons... friends.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.269
Do you really think
your daughter's life

19:47.352 --> 19:49.396
is worth any more than theirs?

19:49.479 --> 19:51.940
One of two things is
going to happen now.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.902
You're going to let us
go, or Lisa will die.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.404
Either one is fine with me.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.824
Just don't hurt her.

20:00.908 --> 20:05.162
As long as you hold up your end
of the deal, we won't.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.168
You ordered
Scylla to be moved.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.670
Show us how.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.098
I'm walking them out!

20:31.313 --> 20:33.106
Stand down.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.441
Stand down.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.151
Yes, sir.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.080
They must have found
another way out.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.915
-That's impossible.
-Well, then, they're caught or dead.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.959
How much longer
are we gonna wait?

20:52.042 --> 20:54.002
You were the one who
said Scofield had a plan.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.921
And you put a gun
in Mr. White's face!

20:56.004 --> 20:58.340
He was going to
call the police.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.054
Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay.
Federal agent.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.222
What?

21:05.305 --> 21:07.891
Quick. I'm gonna help you.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.351
All right, help me
untie the others.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.608
Okay, I'll keep an eye
on Cole and the woman.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.235
I want you to slip out
two at a time.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.361
Okay, you two first.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.570
Why can't we all go together?

21:20.862 --> 21:21.947
You're here. Go arrest them.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.323
I want to get out
as many of you as possible

21:23.407 --> 21:24.408
before they realize
what's happening.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.661
Theodore Bagwell's
wanted for murder.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.621
And now Cole Pfeiffer's
a hostage-taker.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.373
What am I gonna do?

21:31.456 --> 21:32.874
You're gonna run for your life,

21:33.542 --> 21:35.210
you idiot.

21:38.839 --> 21:39.881
I'm leaving.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.049
No, Mr. White.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.676
No, Mr. White. Wait!

21:43.010 --> 21:44.177
No! Wait!

22:00.027 --> 22:02.779
Everybody stay down!
Drop your weapon!

22:21.923 --> 22:23.175
Call 911!

22:31.016 --> 22:32.893
How does it feel, huh?

22:32.976 --> 22:35.103
Being forced to do something
you don't want to do?

22:35.562 --> 22:36.938
But knowing that if you
don't go through with it,

22:37.022 --> 22:38.482
someone you care about
is gonna suffer;

22:38.565 --> 22:39.524
they're gonna pay?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.153
What goes around,
comes around, huh, General?

22:47.115 --> 22:48.367
I...

22:48.450 --> 22:50.410
I can't imagine
what you've been through.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.663
I can't imagine
that you'd want to.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.333
Whatever they've done to you...

22:57.042 --> 22:59.294
"They" are you, my friend.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.381
Whatever they've told you,

23:02.464 --> 23:03.882
you need to realize that...

23:04.299 --> 23:07.052
Scofield and Burrows
are bad men.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.600
You used to be a doctor.

23:13.975 --> 23:16.269
You devoted your whole life
to helping other people.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.146
Now look at you.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.942
They have you holding a gun
on an innocent woman.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.236
So you're innocent?

23:24.319 --> 23:26.029
You're just...

23:26.113 --> 23:27.364
crunching numbers
and running data

23:27.447 --> 23:29.032
to make the world
a better place?

23:31.284 --> 23:32.661
Mrs. Tabak?

23:33.912 --> 23:35.205
You're fine.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.957
You need a couple of minutes.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.544
Hello, Mrs. Tabak?!

23:40.919 --> 23:42.212
You okay?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.006
Say it.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.927
I'm soaking my skirt.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.888
If I don't get the grease out
before it gets to the cleaners,

23:52.597 --> 23:54.015
it'll be ruined.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.601
Okay, ma'am.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.980
I don't know what it
looks like up there

24:00.063 --> 24:01.314
in your ivory tower.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.191
Down on the ground,
men and women are dying

24:03.275 --> 24:05.235
and lives are
being ruined.

24:05.318 --> 24:09.114
So, I'm prepared to do
absolutely anything

24:09.197 --> 24:11.783
in order to stop
you people.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.370
Turn around.

24:18.915 --> 24:22.544
Turn... around, Lisa.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.103
You should've let me try
to convince Mr. White

24:40.187 --> 24:41.813
that everything
was gonna be okay.

24:41.897 --> 24:42.939
That way,
I could've...

24:43.023 --> 24:44.191
What?! Put on a monkey suit
every day

24:44.274 --> 24:45.233
and sit behind a desk.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.277
How long you think
that's gonna last?

24:48.737 --> 24:49.654
Uh-uh.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.407
You gonna walk down the street
with an MP-5?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.960
You can't be serious.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.420
They can identify you, Cole.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.964
You're the only one linking
me to that crime scene.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.634
But, hey, it was nice
working with you.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.582
Don't move!

25:44.459 --> 25:45.794
Turn around.

25:45.877 --> 25:46.920
Turn around!

25:47.003 --> 25:48.547
Gently now, sugar.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.508
That's Special Agent
Miriam Holtz to you, sugar.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.176
Let's go.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.178
I want to speak
with my daughter,

25:55.262 --> 25:57.305
get confirmation
that she's being released.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.182
Sara will be keeping
your daughter in custody

25:59.266 --> 26:00.976
until she knows we're safely
away from this place

26:01.059 --> 26:04.020
with nobody
trailing us.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.190
Company agents aren't
just embedded in the FBI

26:07.274 --> 26:09.150
and the Secret Service.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.904
They're in local law
enforcement, hospitals, DMV.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.281
You'll never see us coming.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.157
Actually, once we get Scylla
into the right hands,

26:16.241 --> 26:18.076
all your agents,
all your operations--

26:18.159 --> 26:20.203
it'll all be out in the open,

26:20.287 --> 26:23.373
and then everyone...
will see you coming.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.589
We did this to you.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.841
We did this to you.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.759
Don't you forget that, old man.

26:36.636 --> 26:40.223
Want to know what your father
really did for the Company?

26:40.307 --> 26:42.267
He was an executioner.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.729
He killed people who
defected from the Company.

26:45.812 --> 26:50.483
And now the men he trained
will be coming after you.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.226
Come on.
Something's not right.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.356
Mrs. Tabak?

27:31.107 --> 27:33.401
Mrs. Tabak?!

27:51.002 --> 27:52.128
She just left--

27:52.212 --> 27:54.673
Tancredi-- she has to be
right outside.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.714
Are you all right?

28:35.797 --> 28:37.048
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.092
I'm heading back now.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.552
No. I want you
in a secure location,

28:40.635 --> 28:41.845
under supervision.

28:41.928 --> 28:42.971
You go home.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.139
But I really need to be there.

28:44.222 --> 28:48.268
I'll call you
once we get Scylla back.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.104
We've given the truck's
license plate and VIN number

28:51.187 --> 28:52.355
to the local police...

28:52.439 --> 28:55.442
We lost our tactical initiative
the minute

28:55.525 --> 28:57.944
that Scofield figured out
our SOPs.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.029
If we want to defeat him,

29:00.113 --> 29:02.699
we've got to alter
our way of operating...

29:02.782 --> 29:05.618
become unpredictable.

29:20.633 --> 29:21.926
It's them.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.052
Michael, where are you?

29:23.136 --> 29:24.888
The Company's armored truck.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.931
We have it.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.057
They got it.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.977
Okay, listen. Michael,
stay on alert, okay?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.270
I will.

29:32.353 --> 29:35.482
See you at the rendezvous.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.420
♪ ♪

30:23.696 --> 30:26.074
You guys get
someplace safe.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.826
Wait till
you hear from us.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.786
You got it.
Good luck, Bobby.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.041
Where are they?

30:35.124 --> 30:37.460
The airport.
We have visual confirmation.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.712
Make sure not a single plane
leaves the ground

30:39.796 --> 30:41.130
before we've got them.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.216
Understood, sir.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.009
Stay with Scofield
and Burrows.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.428
Scylla's the priority.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.860
Check it out.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.783
They're right behind us.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.830
Let's go.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.238
Hey, my name's John Burton.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.032
I'm an off-duty cop
from Chicago.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.200
Listen, I'm walking
through Ontario Airport,

31:51.284 --> 31:53.244
Terminal 2,
right by the ticket counters,

31:53.328 --> 31:54.454
and I just saw something
that you guys

31:54.537 --> 31:56.331
definitely want to check out.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.751
We got company.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.921
Michael Scofield
and Lincoln Burrows.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.005
Let's get out of here.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.048
No, no, no...

32:05.173 --> 32:06.424
The last thing you want to do
right now is run.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.509
Why is that?
You gonna shoot us?

32:08.593 --> 32:09.552
Yeah.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.346
I say the word and my men
will take you both out.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.014
In front
of all these people?

32:13.097 --> 32:15.058
You'd never risk
that kind of exposure.

32:15.725 --> 32:16.935
I think it's clear by now

32:17.018 --> 32:20.813
that you've miscalculated
how far we're willing to go.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.524
Give me the bag.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.535
Give me the bag. Now.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.929
Tell Krantz
this isn't finished.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.181
Oh, you can tell him in person.

32:55.264 --> 32:57.558
Sir? Please
come with us.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.935
Excuse me?

32:59.018 --> 33:00.812
Just a security precaution.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.237
Yeah, sure.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.446
Let's go.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.120
Is this really necessary?

33:17.453 --> 33:18.955
Please empty
the contents of your bag.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.790
Look, all I've got in there
is a laptop

33:20.873 --> 33:22.000
and an external hard drive.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.129
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy.

33:33.219 --> 33:34.887
Let go of the bag, sir.

33:54.699 --> 33:55.616
Yeah?

33:55.700 --> 33:56.743
Well?

33:56.826 --> 33:57.869
Yeah, we got it.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.840
So you knew who I was
from the start, huh?

34:11.507 --> 34:13.801
My real name,
my record...

34:13.885 --> 34:15.470
I read your file, yeah.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.307
What if you hadn't?

34:20.641 --> 34:21.642
What's your point?

34:21.726 --> 34:22.935
What if you never knew

34:23.019 --> 34:25.897
I was Theodore Bagwell,
the convict?

34:28.149 --> 34:30.193
Would you have believed
I was Cole Pfeiffer?

34:30.777 --> 34:33.029
Stellar salesman...

34:33.112 --> 34:35.531
talented speaker?

34:35.615 --> 34:37.825
I don't know.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.161
You certainly had a lot
of other people fooled, though.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.664
Till you pulled
a machine gun on them.

34:46.125 --> 34:49.045
I guess it's like
they said over at GATE:

34:50.421 --> 34:54.926
"We are captives
of our own identities,

34:55.718 --> 34:59.388
living in prisons
of our own creation."

35:04.602 --> 35:07.563
Who would've thought
they'd actually

35:07.647 --> 35:09.816
be right about something?

35:12.151 --> 35:13.903
So if you drop this,

35:13.986 --> 35:15.822
does that mean we
all go back to prison?

35:15.905 --> 35:17.865
Don't worry.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.243
If this doesn't get
in the right hands in one piece,

35:20.326 --> 35:22.495
I'm going to be
in as bad a spot as you are.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.167
Congratulations.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.881
What now?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.759
Now, I live up
to my end of the deal.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.719
The vans are going to be here
in a half an hour.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.429
They're going to be sent
to a field office

35:40.513 --> 35:42.431
where you can go
through processing.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.976
This is all your
transfer paperwork.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.561
You're gonna get this
to an Agent Schmidt.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.229
He's going to be
heading up the convoy.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.772
I wish I could
drive you myself,

35:49.856 --> 35:52.650
but I need to get
to Dallow ASAP.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.278
Are you okay?

35:55.361 --> 35:57.446
Yeah, I'm okay.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.657
No, he's not.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.908
He needs to go to a hospital.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.161
All right, I'm going to send
an ambulance with the vans.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.997
You're going to get
the best medical care available.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.124
Thank you.

36:08.207 --> 36:10.251
No, I should be thanking you.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.545
Okay, because
of what you've done,

36:12.628 --> 36:15.131
lives are going
to be changed forever.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.617
Listen, I need a, uh, ambulance
to come with the convoy.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.128
Sir, what are your orders?

36:56.005 --> 36:57.882
Sir?

37:00.259 --> 37:01.427
I don't know.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.025
None of us will ever have

37:16.108 --> 37:18.694
to look over our
shoulders again.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.322
That's the most
important thing.

37:22.823 --> 37:25.326
No matter what
comes next.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.411
You're gonna make it, Michael.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.205
You'll have
the operation and...

37:29.288 --> 37:31.207
and you'll get through this.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.626
Just like we've gotten
through everything else.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.298
She's worried about you.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.555
♪ ♪

38:00.528 --> 38:02.363
It's nice to know
that the next time

38:02.446 --> 38:04.699
I want to drink one of these,

38:04.782 --> 38:07.702
I won't have to drink it
in this crappy warehouse.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.080
Yeah.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.963
I can't even remember being able
to sit down at a restaurant

38:19.046 --> 38:21.590
or go to a ball game.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.928
God... it seems like
I've been running forever.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.930
It's time to stand still.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.349
Take in the sun.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.769
Salud.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.401
Hey.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.948
I know I'm supposed
to be happy right now.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.867
I'm still scared.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.455
I'm scared we're going
to have come all this way

38:52.538 --> 38:54.165
and I'm going
to lose you anyway.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.209
Come here.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.378
Come on.

39:00.880 --> 39:01.964
Sara...

39:02.048 --> 39:03.299
Just don't tell me
that everything's

39:03.382 --> 39:05.217
going to be okay, please.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.262
Okay.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.183
I won't.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.121
I see you brought
your friend along.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.956
What happened
to Gretchen?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.792
Uh, she got away.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.129
So here it is.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.423
Wha...?

39:46.467 --> 39:49.095
Oh, my God.

39:49.178 --> 39:51.180
Wow. I can't
believe it.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.848
So what's next?

39:52.932 --> 39:54.183
Senator Dallow?

39:54.266 --> 39:55.851
No, I need to tie up
some loose ends.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.771
Did Gretchen and Bagwell say
anything else about Scylla

39:58.854 --> 40:00.898
-in terms of other buyers?
-Feng.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.274
He's dead.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.027
They didn't talk
to anyone else?

40:05.111 --> 40:06.320
We need to get
as many indictments

40:06.404 --> 40:07.363
on this thing
as possible.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.864
Well, Bagwell might know.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.367
Once we get him in an interview room
and offer him a deal,

40:11.450 --> 40:14.161
his mouth will start moving.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.849
Remember what I said to you
the first day we got here?

40:36.517 --> 40:38.227
Yeah, you said
that when this was over,

40:38.310 --> 40:40.521
we were gonna settle up.

40:41.897 --> 40:43.190
We're settled.

40:46.777 --> 40:47.778
Michael.

40:48.571 --> 40:49.613
It's been an hour.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.615
Would you call Self
and check on that ambulance?

41:04.378 --> 41:07.256
Is he not picking up?

41:07.715 --> 41:09.842
Maybe something's wrong
with the signal.

41:10.926 --> 41:14.054
The number you
have reached is not in service at this time

41:14.221 --> 41:16.474
and there is no new number.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.728
What is it?

41:31.780 --> 41:34.033
You did really good
on this one, Miriam.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.118
You really held your own.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.246
Thank you.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.667
Can I take a closer look
at that?

41:50.674 --> 41:51.884
I'm sorry.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.178
What are you
talking about?

42:52.736 --> 42:54.905
Self.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.032
Self.

43:42.244 --> 43:44.246
