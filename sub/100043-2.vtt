WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:05.964
No one's around, again.

00:06.048 --> 00:08.300
Is it just me or have people
been avoiding us lately?

00:08.926 --> 00:11.470
I get it, twins are a ton of work,

00:11.470 --> 00:14.056
but Haley and Dylan
ask us to help out a lot.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.476
Maybe we're both just loopy
from sleep deprivation.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.354
I don't even remember
making this cup of tea.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.481
It's fine, I'll just jog with them.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.525
Don't push yourself too hard on that run.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.568
Please. Do you know who you're talking to?

00:26.652 --> 00:28.737
Why does everyone always ask me that?

00:30.072 --> 00:32.074
Ooh, that was close.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.158
Are they gone?
- Yes!

00:33.242 --> 00:37.037
Phew! Okay, who would like
to help me with a magic trick?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.081
Oh.
- Alex, great.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.125
Now, uh, take this dove.
Try not to rile her up.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.795
She's about to spend
the better part of an hour in my pants.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.811
Until now, we haven't had
the best of luck with renters.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.773
So, when you said you were a cat person,
uh, on your application...

01:04.857 --> 01:06.233
- Mmm-hmm.
- Um...

01:06.525 --> 01:08.110
Oh, that... That's just my watch.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.362
But then Brad and Paul moved in,

01:10.362 --> 01:13.782
and it was like the perfect
friend-couple showed up at our front door.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.411
And you wanted to stop renting
completely after the cat lady.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.789
I just... I couldn't listen
to her scream every time she took a bath.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.542
I can't believe
how much we have in common!

01:23.542 --> 01:24.793
Daughters the same age.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.253
You both played football.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.214
You know, an ex-teammate
of mine is a coach for the Chargers.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.924
He can get us right on the field.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.217
You just have to watch where you stand

01:32.301 --> 01:34.011
'cause you could end up
under a wide receiver.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.470
Okay! Stop selling, I'm in!

01:35.554 --> 01:37.973
They even prepaid for six months.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.850
That means they'll be here
till Christmas!

01:39.850 --> 01:41.643
We can include them in our Secret Santa.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.729
Oh, it would be nice
not to get Lily again.

01:43.729 --> 01:44.938
Mmm-hmm.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.065
The Duke...

01:49.443 --> 01:51.486
...becomes a uke...

01:53.447 --> 01:55.574
...becomes a Luke.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.951
- Dad! That was amazing!
- Yeah!

01:58.035 --> 02:01.622
Amazing that I think a hacky parlor
trick is going to cut it at SCARB.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.583
You heard me right, Alex, SCARB.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.753
The Southern California Area Realtors'
Banquet is the biggest event of the year

02:07.753 --> 02:09.546
for Southern California area realtors.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.967
The other events, SCARL, SCARD,
SCARP, SCARG, SCARF,

02:14.051 --> 02:15.719
they're fine.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.846
But SCARB, it's the show.

02:17.930 --> 02:21.016
I performed at last year's SCARB and...
And I did well.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.144
Too well.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.395
Thank you.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.482
Wait, was there someone else
who wanted to say thank you?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.858
Oh, that's right,

02:29.942 --> 02:31.735
Puff wanted to say thank you.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.322
Thank you so much. Thank you.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.282
Unbelievable!

02:37.366 --> 02:39.201
When you were under water
for nine minutes,

02:39.201 --> 02:41.787
I almost broke the glass myself!

02:41.787 --> 02:43.664
You have got to come back next year.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.707
Well, I guess I could, uh...

02:46.542 --> 02:49.086
...get behind you on that.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.881
I don't know how I did that.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.591
For the last year,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.844
I haven't paid for a drink in
any realtor bar in California.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.262
I've never known that kind of adulation.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.681
If I blow it tonight, it all goes away.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.267
I'm just another bum walking into Brokers,

03:03.267 --> 03:05.394
paying for my own Long Escrow Iced Tea.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.855
Dad, I'm on the short list
for this NASA job.

03:07.855 --> 03:12.025
I just need to finish these forms,
but I swear to you, it really was great.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.151
Oh.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.403
I'm sorry.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.071
And I am a tough audience.

03:16.071 --> 03:17.322
I'm a scientist!

03:17.406 --> 03:20.033
It's not like I'm fooled
by simple misdirection.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.869
I told Janice I'm 21.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.287
I'm pretty sure she'd break up with me

03:23.287 --> 03:25.414
if she found out I wasn't even legal yet.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.250
Then she asked if I'd buy wine
for dinner tonight.

03:28.834 --> 03:32.004
Mind moving your thumb, Alexandra?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.506
That's what that's short for?

03:45.350 --> 03:46.768
So sweet of you to take them to the park.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.437
Just make sure they're someplace shady.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.646
Will do.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.194
It's amazing how well you've been doing
selling Aunt Miranda's hot sauce.

03:55.194 --> 03:59.364
I don't want to tell you how much money
I have lost trying to sell it over here.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.866
I wouldn't mind having an exact figure...

04:00.866 --> 04:04.286
I can't believe that you guys
are already engaged.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.704
Where did you guys meet?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.664
On the street where I sell my artwork.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.666
One day, she let me paint her.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.792
She became my muse.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.544
I'm so happy for you, Sonia.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.172
Finally you found the love
that you deserve.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.800
It's great seeing you being
supportive of Sonia for a...

04:18.884 --> 04:19.885
She's an idiot.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.721
He's obviously a gold digger,
and I'm going to prove it to her.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.431
How do you know he's a gold digger?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.808
He's a starving artist, she has money.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.478
Do you really think
that someone young and beautiful like that

04:29.478 --> 04:31.897
is gonna fall in love
with a rich, older person?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.024
- Never happens.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.109
I hear what I'm saying and we're fine.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.158
When Sheryl McCray comes in,
pay for her coffee with this.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.454
Sheryl McCray,
powerhouse real estate developer.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.998
I've been trying to land
her closet business for years,

04:50.082 --> 04:52.084
but it's impossible to get a meeting.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.002
This article, though,

04:54.086 --> 04:57.172
says where she buys a latte
every Saturday at 10:00.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.800
Today, I'm going to buy that latte.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.969
We'll get to talking
and before you know it,

05:01.969 --> 05:04.805
she'll be buying a "latte" closets.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.181
Sheryl McCray?

05:06.265 --> 05:08.141
Matthew Kang, Kang Cabinets.

05:08.225 --> 05:10.269
- Would you have just two minutes to...
- Are you serious?

05:11.436 --> 05:14.898
I'm not going to do business with someone
who interrupts me in a coffee shop

05:14.982 --> 05:17.776
while I'm trying to enjoy a few
precious moments of alone time

05:17.860 --> 05:19.862
with my child and her nanny.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.071
I think she's wet.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.866
Change of plans, big spender?

05:25.909 --> 05:28.245
Oh! Really? An emergency?

05:28.245 --> 05:29.496
- I guess I could...
- Relax.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.999
They don't need help with the babies.
Luke has them.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.292
Thank God.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.586
Ugh, let's get rid
of this bad reminder, huh?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.796
- Oh, I know that lady.
- What? How?

05:37.880 --> 05:40.382
Oh, Mommy and Me class at my yoga place,
she's there every week.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.926
Oh, in fact,
it's starting in half an hour.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.137
I think I'm gonna grab the kids
and go do my thang...

05:45.137 --> 05:46.305
Hey.
- Hi.

05:46.305 --> 05:48.557
You know what, I haven't spent any time
with those little ragamuffins.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.641
Why don't you let me take them?

05:49.725 --> 05:51.935
- But I kind of wanted to...
- Oh, take the help.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.979
Don't be a hero, Super Mom, huh?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.859
Is it me or is your mom acting weird?

05:58.859 --> 06:01.737
No. No. Don't you leave...

06:01.737 --> 06:03.697
Your cue is "cadabra!"

06:08.035 --> 06:09.119
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.954
We made kale smoothies
and wanted to share.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.372
Thank you.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.166
Oh, no!

06:14.166 --> 06:16.877
We're intruding.
You're throwing a big pancake brunch.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.337
Where is everyone?

06:18.337 --> 06:19.880
Uh, this is just for us.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.840
- Oh.
- What's this?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.467
Art project for school.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.595
I just grabbed something out of the trash
and threw glitter glue on it.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.804
Got a 70.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.097
She knows that's out of 100, right?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.683
Vera went through a found art phase.

06:31.767 --> 06:36.021
This is, um... This is the Michelangelo's
<i>David</i> that she made out of plastic.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.898
Recycled plastic.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.067
We only get one planet,
let's take care of it.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.151
Mmm.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.195
I guess someone's never heard of the moon.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.906
Oh, hey, speaking of art, you're so lucky

06:45.906 --> 06:47.824
to live right around the corner
from a museum.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.118
Who was your favorite artist in
their Post-Impressionist show?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.286
- Oh, uh...
- Uh...

06:51.620 --> 06:53.539
I mean, gun to my head? I would say...

06:54.039 --> 06:55.165
Gauguin, perhaps?

06:55.249 --> 06:57.501
Uh, to the exhibit? Yes. In a heartbeat.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.378
You know, actually,
I'm thinking about going today.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.088
Would you guys care to join?

07:01.088 --> 07:04.716
Oh, I'd love to, but I promised
this one we'd go on a canyon hike.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.468
Once an underwear model...

07:06.552 --> 07:09.596
A couple <i>International Male</i>
covers to pay for medical school.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.765
He'll never let me forget it.

07:11.849 --> 07:12.975
Okay, we should go.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.768
Oh, unless,
did you want to join for the hike?

07:14.977 --> 07:18.897
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm... I'm running
the Santa Monica Stairs this afternoon.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.148
- Oh.
- So... It's Saturday.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.233
If they don't see me there,

07:21.233 --> 07:22.401
they get worried.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.777
And thank you for the yummies!

07:23.861 --> 07:26.280
- Yes. Mmm-hmm.
- They sure are.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.991
- Oh, no. So, um...
- Oh.

07:28.991 --> 07:30.951
I didn't know you were a museum lover.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.036
Oh, well, yeah,
before you and I started dating,

07:33.120 --> 07:34.788
I used to go to the museum all the time.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.832
I'm not blaming you, of course.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.751
You know that the Hollywood
Wax Museum isn't an actual...

07:39.835 --> 07:43.255
What about you, Rocky?
You get winded taking towels upstairs.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.674
That's because after we met,
not blaming you,

07:45.674 --> 07:48.260
um, I sort of...
I tapered off a little bit.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.928
To focus on the relationship.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.972
But this is good,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.891
- us getting back to our roots.
- Yeah.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.225
You know? Enjoy the museum.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.935
- Yeah. Enjoy your run.
- I will.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.646
- You haven't, by chance seen my...
- They're still in the box.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.106
- Back of the closet?
- Uh-huh.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.318
How come you never let me
play with that thing?

08:04.318 --> 08:07.905
This "thing" medaled in three
different Air Expos, Manny.

08:07.905 --> 08:08.989
It's not a toy.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.532
Hey, look at this.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.326
That's Sonia's fiance, right?

08:12.326 --> 08:14.411
It says he's from
one of the richest families in Colombia.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.829
I knew the guy was all right.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.123
Oh, I see.
Being rich makes you "all right."

08:18.207 --> 08:19.208
That's not what I meant.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.667
Your mom thought
he might be a gold digger.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.378
And by the way, unlike you,
I grew up working class.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.589
Oh, please.
The only blue collar in this house

08:25.589 --> 08:28.050
is the bedazzled one
on your purebred French Bulldog.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.760
She was going through a depressed period.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.638
You're only as happy as your
least happy child, Manny.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.515
I'm just saying,
I've never seen you show much interest

08:34.515 --> 08:35.641
in someone who didn't have money.

08:35.641 --> 08:36.725
That's ridiculous.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.685
Hey, buddy! Come on, take a load off.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.938
- Have a drink with us.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.815
I know what it's like
to put in a hard day's work.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.983
Jay Pritchett, by the way.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.360
Yes, we've met many times.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.946
Remember? A couple years ago,
I loaned you money for a cab.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.072
Oh, yeah, right.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.826
Hi, Mama. She's not after our money.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.495
How do I know?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.288
She has money! Lots of it.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.748
And I'm marrying this woman.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.291
I'll see you for the wedding next week.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.712
Ay, next week? That's very quick.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.215
I don't want to give Sonia
a chance to change her mind.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.550
I'm sure you don't.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.636
You can't marry my sister.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.721
- Why?
- Two words.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.182
Maybe one with a hyphen. Gold digger.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.395
I've always hated to see people
take advantage of others in that way.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.230
I can't let that happen here.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.315
But doesn't your sister
have a lot of money?

09:25.399 --> 09:27.693
Would you be that quick
to marry her if she didn't?

09:30.362 --> 09:31.738
Hey, have you seen Nestor?

09:31.822 --> 09:33.240
I sent him off.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.826
Nobody's taking anyone's money today.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.494
Oh, I didn't need that much from him.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.454
I just need to reshoot
the end of my thesis film.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.374
The special effects are weak
and Prague was clearly faked.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.126
What the hell are you talking about?

09:44.126 --> 09:46.128
Nestor. His family's loaded.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.212
I looked him up.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.132
He's a Berellez?

09:50.132 --> 09:53.927
They own a soccer team,
12 hotels and five judges!

09:54.928 --> 09:56.847
Oh, really?

09:56.847 --> 10:00.309
I don't care if you want
to buy 10,000 closets.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.103
I'm not at work. I am trying to
bond with my child...

10:03.395 --> 10:04.605
...ren.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.689
Bye.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.065
Hi.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.234
I'm so sorry about that, it's just...

10:09.318 --> 10:11.028
People are constantly trying to sell me

10:11.028 --> 10:14.114
and it is not always appropriate,
you know?

10:14.198 --> 10:15.365
I hear that.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.160
Mommies, mommies, Gary.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.079
Let's start with a deep hip stretch.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.292
I find this class hard enough.
How do you do it with twins?

10:25.292 --> 10:29.421
Well, uh, it's nothing compared to the
babies I gotta juggle at the office, huh?

10:29.505 --> 10:31.006
I know that feeling.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.675
Now up and down, a little deeper.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.178
You know,
there's a baby-friendly tapas place

10:36.178 --> 10:39.848
Atticus and I go to after,
if you ladies are up for it.

10:39.932 --> 10:41.725
I don't think it's time to bond, Gary.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.393
And I'm pretty sure
you had to sue to get in here.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.811
He did. And up.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.605
We had to settle. And down.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.689
Nice.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.526
So what kind of closets do you make,
because I actually need...

10:50.526 --> 10:52.528
You know what? Would it be okay
if we did this after class?

10:52.528 --> 10:55.030
It's just, I get no time with them.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.698
Of course, of course.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.706
Oh, hey, how were the steps?

11:04.998 --> 11:08.252
Oh, so... So great, so tough.
Uh, love the burn.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.962
What's up with the hat?
I can barely see your eyes.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.130
Uh, same old eyes.
I'm just going to go ahead and...

11:13.257 --> 11:15.801
Why is there a Wilson logo
on your forehead?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.052
I don't know, must be the hat.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.136
Nobody's buying it.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.305
Just skip to the part
where you tell us the truth.

11:20.389 --> 11:23.100
Fine! I... I never made it
to the stairs, okay?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.310
I got distracted.

11:25.519 --> 11:26.520
I got it.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.896
Here we go.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.524
Nice. Dig, dig, dig.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.904
I'm a fraud. Happy?

11:35.988 --> 11:37.823
I never even made it to the stairs.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.116
Don't even know where they are.

11:39.116 --> 11:42.119
You know, I can't say I'm...
I'm not a tad bit disappointed in you.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.539
It's just a little lonely going on this
journey of self-improvement all by my...

11:45.539 --> 11:47.499
- What is that?
- Hmm? What?

11:47.583 --> 11:49.835
What part of the museum
did you get this from?

11:50.419 --> 11:51.753
Well, apparent...

11:51.837 --> 11:55.549
Well, obviously you're not familiar
with Matisse's feather period.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.051
Did you maybe get this across
the street from the museum?

11:58.260 --> 11:59.261
- Hmm?
- Nope.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.554
Because if you had,

12:00.554 --> 12:03.974
you'd have a distinctive
and sparkly hand stamp!

12:04.391 --> 12:05.601
Hi, I just need one ticket...

12:05.601 --> 12:06.977
Oh, my God, you guys! Let's hurry.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.061
Hurrying where?

12:08.145 --> 12:09.646
There's a retrospective,

12:09.730 --> 12:12.441
"Cher in the '70s:
Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves."

12:13.609 --> 12:14.776
You went without me?

12:14.860 --> 12:16.403
What do we always say?

12:16.403 --> 12:21.366
Every Cher experience
should be a shared experience.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.993
I'm sorry, Mitchell.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.912
Look, if I could turn back time...

12:26.747 --> 12:27.748
Knock, knock.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.625
Give me the feather.
No, put the feather in your cap.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.877
Hey, just checking in. How was the museum?

12:31.877 --> 12:33.462
- Oh, um...
- Oh, so great. Sit down.

12:33.462 --> 12:37.841
Cam was actually about to tell us
what he learned about Picasso.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.426
Oh, I know so little about him.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.678
Well, it turns out,

12:41.762 --> 12:44.014
he was born, um,

12:44.014 --> 12:46.934
in the wagon of a... Of a traveling show.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.894
- Oh.
- His mother, poor thing...

12:48.894 --> 12:51.104
She was forced to dance for...

12:51.188 --> 12:52.814
You want me to teach you
how to play bridge?

12:52.898 --> 12:54.942
- Sure.
- I need a new partner.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.276
I keep beating the computer.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.363
Listen, we want to invite you
guys to a dinner party tonight.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.614
Oh.
- Yeah, you guys are going to love

13:00.614 --> 13:01.740
Xander and Mateo.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.409
They just finished an ultramarathon in
Mozambique where they're lecturing.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.579
And to build up an appetite,
we play sprinting charades.

13:07.663 --> 13:12.334
And this silly version of Celebrity
using only characters from Dickens.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.878
That sounds so fun. We'll be right back.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.673
We were just fanning out
some celery on a platter.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.510
Okay, I want them gone.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.220
Even if you mean kill them, I'm in.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.429
What are we supposed to do?

13:24.513 --> 13:26.181
Spend the next six months
with our drapes closed

13:26.265 --> 13:28.517
like Pepper after one
of his cheek implants fell?

13:28.517 --> 13:30.185
Speaking of Picasso...

13:30.269 --> 13:32.271
How are we supposed to get out of this?

13:32.271 --> 13:33.897
Move out west.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.275
That's what those towns are for. Disappearing.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.527
We live a mile from the ocean. What town?

13:38.527 --> 13:39.778
What's wrong with me?

13:39.862 --> 13:42.030
I'm so stupid!

13:42.114 --> 13:43.532
Sweetie, what is it?

13:43.532 --> 13:45.868
She beat me and she never
even played before!

13:47.286 --> 13:50.205
I'm such a loser.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.834
Is she okay or...

13:54.334 --> 13:57.129
Vera has this thing where
she needs to be perfect all the time.

13:57.129 --> 13:59.548
You know, the only reason
we moved to this neighborhood

13:59.548 --> 14:03.468
was so we could be closer
to this accelerated school she got into.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.305
Maybe we need to reconsider the move.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.140
Naturally, we'll pay for all six months.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.142
- Yes.
- We should go talk to her.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.226
I'm sorry, guys.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.228
I was looking forward to that celery.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.814
I could really use a cheat day.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.691
Vera?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.276
Lily, how...

14:19.276 --> 14:20.360
I set up my mirror

14:20.444 --> 14:21.737
- so I could see her cards.
- Uh...

14:21.737 --> 14:25.199
I had to. I couldn't stand her
making me feel bad about myself.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.408
No, no, I get it.

14:26.408 --> 14:29.244
I'm not sure they don't enjoy
making people feel inferior.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.413
Which is something
you guys could never do.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.915
Aw...

14:34.041 --> 14:37.002
Wait, did she just say that
we could never make people feel inferior

14:37.002 --> 14:39.004
because we're so inferior ourselves?

14:39.004 --> 14:41.965
But cleverly wrapped
in a compliment to avoid detection?

14:42.049 --> 14:43.675
In other words, the perfect gay zinger?

14:43.759 --> 14:45.093
Well, she may not finish high school,

14:45.177 --> 14:47.179
but she will hold her own
at any Tony party the rest of her life.

14:47.179 --> 14:48.263
Yeah, she will.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.599
I'm so sorry to hear that,

14:50.599 --> 14:54.645
but, honestly, if your wife left you just
because you missed her birthday...

14:54.645 --> 14:55.896
To drive you to the airport.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.523
I heard him, Manny, thank you.

14:57.523 --> 14:59.691
You're probably better off without her.

14:59.775 --> 15:00.943
You're right.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.238
I only wish I had something nicer to wear
to our son's wedding tonight.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.864
You know,
you and I are about the same size.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.157
Why don't you borrow my tux?

15:08.784 --> 15:10.410
- Really?
- I insist.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.621
In fact,
I want to give you something else.

15:12.621 --> 15:13.705
Your plane?

15:13.789 --> 15:15.290
Uh, no, I was reaching for my wallet,

15:15.374 --> 15:17.751
you know, to give you
the money I still owe you for the cab.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.587
I've admired this plane ever since
I fell off the roof getting it for you.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.297
I am so touched and honored.

15:22.381 --> 15:24.091
- Actually...
- He fell off the roof.

15:28.637 --> 15:29.638
Fine.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.223
Enjoy.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.433
I will name her <i>Roberta.</i>

15:34.685 --> 15:35.936
It's a boy plane!

15:40.315 --> 15:43.610
I feel like I got the buckles wrong.
Does this straitjacket look right on me?

15:43.694 --> 15:44.903
More and more.

15:44.987 --> 15:48.031
Dad, I love you, but I don't have time
for another magic trick.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.449
I can't find my ID,

15:49.533 --> 15:51.326
and I need a copy of it for this NASA job,

15:51.410 --> 15:53.954
and my application
has to be mailed by 5:00.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.581
I'm sorry. Can I help you look?

15:55.581 --> 15:57.457
Ugh! This is hopeless.

15:57.541 --> 16:01.670
Unless there was some way to jump the line
at both the post office and the DMV,

16:01.670 --> 16:04.256
and the only way to get to
either of them at this hour

16:04.256 --> 16:05.632
is to drive in the carpool lane.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.551
We're back!

16:07.551 --> 16:10.220
Oh, my God, I missed you so much!
Aw.

16:10.304 --> 16:13.432
Oh, I got this. You look so tired.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.475
- But I've been napping all day.
- You're welcome.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.562
Can I at least smell their heads?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.149
Nestor, hi, it's Gloria Pritchett again.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.775
Please call me back.

16:23.859 --> 16:27.446
I need to explain,
this was all a big mistake.

16:27.446 --> 16:29.907
Nestor. Where are you, my love?

16:29.907 --> 16:31.033
<i>Ay,</i> no.

16:32.784 --> 16:36.830
Sonia, I have very bad news to tell you.

16:36.914 --> 16:39.625
Let me get Nestor. He's my rock. Nestor!

16:39.625 --> 16:42.002
What happened to my independent sister

16:42.002 --> 16:44.713
that I admired so much
because she needed no man...

16:44.713 --> 16:46.757
Where is he?

16:46.757 --> 16:50.093
I thought he was a gold digger,
so I chased him out.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.345
You did what?

16:51.345 --> 16:54.890
But the silver lining is that
you still have all your money.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.476
What money? I don't have any money!

16:57.476 --> 16:59.728
What do you mean?
The money from the hot sauce business

16:59.728 --> 17:01.313
that you're doing so well.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.982
No, it was all a lie!
I just didn't want him to be suspicious!

17:04.066 --> 17:06.401
Look, I'm wearing aluminum earrings!

17:06.485 --> 17:08.111
They're turning my ears green.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.238
Ugh.

17:09.530 --> 17:13.033
It took me two years to land
that rich, beautiful moron.

17:13.033 --> 17:16.119
Where am I going
to get that kind of money?

17:18.830 --> 17:19.831
I tripped!

17:19.915 --> 17:21.291
Someone call a lawyer!

17:21.375 --> 17:23.085
- You didn't trip.
- Yes, I did.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.420
Look, the floor is all wet.

17:25.504 --> 17:28.590
Sonia, that didn't work
at the Princess Cruise ship,

17:28.674 --> 17:30.300
and it's not going to work here.

17:30.843 --> 17:34.304
Every time I try to get my life together,
you always ruin it for me.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.348
You owe me a rich husband!

17:36.348 --> 17:37.432
I'll find you one!

17:37.516 --> 17:41.645
There are plenty old, rich men around
here that would do anything that you say.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.938
Some of them can still hear.

17:44.398 --> 17:46.775
- Who's this?
- Oh, he's, um...

17:48.527 --> 17:50.320
He's the best hedge guy in town.

17:50.404 --> 17:51.572
Congratulate him.

17:51.572 --> 17:52.906
He just got a new plane.

17:53.323 --> 17:56.869
Oh, a hedge guy. Fascinating.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.329
And how did you get started
in that business?

17:59.413 --> 18:01.039
I bought the clippers.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.332
Wow...

18:02.416 --> 18:04.835
And where are you going dressed so nice?

18:04.835 --> 18:07.087
- A wedding.
- Oh, I love weddings!

18:07.171 --> 18:08.172
Would you like to accompany me?

18:08.172 --> 18:10.215
I would love to.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.633
And can we take your plane?

18:11.717 --> 18:13.010
Yeah, sure.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.264
Why is our gardener wearing your tuxedo?

18:17.264 --> 18:19.057
Why is Nestor gone?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.642
Let me lock the door first.

18:21.852 --> 18:24.354
Gloria! You ruined my life again!

18:25.355 --> 18:26.398
Oh!

18:26.398 --> 18:27.774
Is this your ring?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.195
It is!

18:32.029 --> 18:33.739
Is this your sock?

18:34.364 --> 18:35.365
It is!

18:35.449 --> 18:36.533
Oh.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.829
Is this your card?

18:40.913 --> 18:42.247
I don't remember!

18:42.706 --> 18:45.292
Now everything is where it belongs.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.377
Except for this candle,

18:47.461 --> 18:48.962
which obviously belongs...

18:50.797 --> 18:52.257
...on the piano.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.926
Oh, my God!

18:53.926 --> 18:56.845
You're right. It's like I want to fail.

18:56.929 --> 18:59.389
Dad, stop being crazy! Your act is great!

18:59.473 --> 19:02.100
It's a flat finish,
which means it's a flat act.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.977
It's obviously two candles.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.438
I put the second one over there
while I was distracting you

19:06.522 --> 19:08.649
by throwing a card into that stupid grape.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.777
We're home!

19:11.777 --> 19:13.362
My babies!

19:13.362 --> 19:16.406
I feel like I haven't seen you all day.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.158
Did you have fun today?

19:18.242 --> 19:19.409
Well, that's easy to find out.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.328
Let me just upload this baby cam footage.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.080
The what... What was that? Hmm?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.165
Oh, one of their buttons
is actually a camera.

19:25.249 --> 19:26.542
It's not greatest quality, but...

19:26.542 --> 19:29.378
Wait, you took my babies
to a liquor store?

19:29.795 --> 19:31.255
No, it's the...

19:31.255 --> 19:33.006
it's the wine museum.

19:33.090 --> 19:34.675
It's Ace Liquor, Luke!

19:34.675 --> 19:38.595
I've been going there since I was 15
minutes past my 21st birthday.

19:38.679 --> 19:40.180
- Well, I am horrified that...
- Wait, wait.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.682
I just fast forwarded,

19:41.682 --> 19:43.851
and it's you talking
to some lady at a yoga class.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.018
She's from the magazine!

19:45.102 --> 19:47.354
You pimped out my babies
for a sales pitch?

19:47.354 --> 19:48.438
Who did it hurt?

19:48.522 --> 19:50.482
<i>I do a lot of...</i>

19:50.732 --> 19:51.942
Oh, disgusting.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.652
Personally, I can't stand to see...

19:53.652 --> 19:57.823
Some guard at the DMV giving our
five-month-old a bite of his hot dog?

19:57.823 --> 19:59.408
He only watched them for a second.

19:59.408 --> 20:03.328
Wow. I was so happy you all wanted
time with the babies today

20:03.412 --> 20:05.205
because lately it has felt like

20:05.289 --> 20:07.249
you didn't even want to be
bothered with them.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.544
Turns out you only want
to help when it can help you.

20:10.544 --> 20:13.338
Part of me wonders why we even stay here.

20:13.422 --> 20:14.882
Because you eat and live here for free?

20:14.882 --> 20:15.966
I said part.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.260
Okay, I'm not saying
that what they did was great,

20:18.260 --> 20:19.636
but isn't that what families do?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.263
Help each other out?

20:21.263 --> 20:25.350
And are we ever really too young
to come to our family's aid?

20:26.768 --> 20:28.812
You're not seriously trying
to get us to let you

20:28.896 --> 20:30.856
use them for your magic trick, are you?

20:32.608 --> 20:33.942
It is my card!

20:36.486 --> 20:38.197
You guys have been great,

20:38.197 --> 20:41.033
but I should be getting
my beautiful assistant here

20:41.033 --> 20:42.951
out of this tuxedo

20:43.035 --> 20:45.829
and into some warm jammies.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.087
You guys.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.839
It's you that make it work.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.845
So, I'm sorry about earlier.
I hope I wasn't rude.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.972
Please, I totally get it.
Are you free for a bite now?

21:04.139 --> 21:06.600
Uh, sure.
I guess I got a couple minutes.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.726
Perfect.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.103
I'll get us a table
at Straight to the Tapas.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.480
Great. Meet you there.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.732
I'm just getting rid of him,
we're not going.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.943
Oh, thank God.
When his shirt rose up earlier,

21:15.943 --> 21:17.486
I saw a Dora the Explorer tattoo.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.863
And I do not want to hear
the story behind that one.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.661
This stays between us.
