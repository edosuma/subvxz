That's a shame, Frankie.
Lot of unanswered questions.

19:29.435 --> 19:33.905
You want your fight?
You got your fight.
You and me, right now.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.974
Well, I-- No.
What? Daddy, you can beat him.
Come on.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.077
- You're next.
- It'll be like the old days.
I will kill you.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.646
I will knock your nose
off your face.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.048
You wanna knock something,
you knock it off of me.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.717
That's right.
All right,
you got a fight.

19:46.719 --> 19:47.818
Greg, get my gloves.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.121
I'm sorry, bro.
Yeah, well, sorry's not
gonna get our money back.

19:50.123 --> 19:54.392
He was so fast.
You should have moved around
a little more and tired him out.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.826
We have nothing.
I don't know
what to say.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.564
I gave it my best.
Yeah. You know what?
Your best wasn't good enough.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.966
- Hey, you have the time?
- Aw, not you again.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.068
We don't have any money.
We just lost it all.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.037
Empty your pockets.
<i>Hey, meth-head.</i>

20:06.039 --> 20:08.506
Are you listening to me?
We don't have any money.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.908
Do it,
or I will kill you both.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.110
Okay, here you go.
Look. Empty.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.812
Now you.
I don't have anything.

20:14.814 --> 20:15.713
Do it.
I don't have--

20:15.715 --> 20:18.849
Just empty your pockets.
No. I'm not emptying 'em.
I'm not even gonna--

20:18.851 --> 20:20.685
I don't feel like standing
in this alley all night.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.986
It's a matter of principle.
A matter of principle?

20:21.988 --> 20:26.857
- I don't feel like standing
in an alley with a meth-head.
- I'm gonna stab you, man!

20:26.859 --> 20:31.028
For the love of God,
empty your pockets.
Okay.

20:34.499 --> 20:37.602
- What the hell is that?
- Give it to me.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.972
You give us a second.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.909
Where did you
get that money?

20:45.110 --> 20:47.011
I had to change the bet--
a little.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.080
You bet against me?
I bet against you.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.515
Why would you
bet against me?
It was the right move.

20:51.517 --> 20:54.852
I mean, you got
your ass kicked.
Why wouldn't you tell me?

20:54.854 --> 20:58.756
I could have taken a dive.
I wouldn't have had
to get my ass kicked.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.559
Mac, it had to look real.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.562
Were you gonna
tell me eventually?

21:06.431 --> 21:08.132
Yes.
Yeah?

21:08.134 --> 21:11.769
I was going
to tell you eventually.
Yeah?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.739
You know what?
Stab this son of a bitch.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.140
Oh, wait a second.
Oh, come on, Mac.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.843
Don't be like that, man.
You would have done
the same thing.

21:18.845 --> 21:22.113
Come on, don't act
like a baby.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.782
Please don't stab me.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.585
Bash this ugly jerk's
face in, Daddy.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.755
Your last chance
to chicken out.
That ain't gonna happen, Bobby.

21:30.757 --> 21:34.558
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.
All right, Frankie.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.761
Seeing that we're
a couple of old men here,

21:36.763 --> 21:39.730
I think we should
lay down some ground rules.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.133
Now. Number one.
