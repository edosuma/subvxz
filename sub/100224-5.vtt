00:37.955 --> 00:39.831
So you got your clearance back.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.209
Your lawyer did it for me.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.337
Technically, now I'm an investigator.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.256
I'm close to something.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.424
What?

00:52.427 --> 00:53.720
What's going on?

00:57.140 --> 00:58.350
Warren.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.534
What did you find?

01:16.577 --> 01:20.497
Your father was unaccounted for
at the time of Chuck Buhrman's murder.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.458
No, he was on patrol with his partner.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.878
There was a gap. Over an hour.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.716
And he showed up to his next call
with blood on his shoes.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.889
-Jesus Christ.
-Warren.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.025
My father had me shanked.

01:48.817 --> 01:49.818
What?

01:52.362 --> 01:53.739
Oh, my God.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.993
And he will do it again.
He obviously doesn't want me talking.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.121
-You need to get into protective custody.
-You think that will work?

02:01.622 --> 02:04.833
Do you have any idea how far his reach is?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.037
-You're getting played.
-Like hell.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.874
He's a convict, Pop.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.751
He'd tell you Big Bird shanked him
if he thought it'd get him out of there.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.087
-You didn't see what I saw.
-No.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.923
But I heard the shit you been spillin'
about Owen Cave.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.009
-Excuse me?
-Your new episode?

03:37.092 --> 03:40.429
Shining that hot guilty light on Cave
without any real evidence?

03:40.512 --> 03:42.723
The man went ghost for 74 minutes

03:42.806 --> 03:45.225
and then shows up to his next call
tracking blood on the carpet.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.685
Not enough.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.604
You were right there
when we found that shit.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.189
I'm not saying it ain't him.

03:50.272 --> 03:53.901
But you do not go blowing the man up
publicly without knowing 100%.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.445
I'm not a prosecutor. I'm a podcaster.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.572
Hey, my name is on this thing too.

03:59.198 --> 04:02.284
And what are you doing? Aren't you
supposed to be keeping her in check?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.744
-Since when?
-Thank you!

04:04.036 --> 04:06.413
But it wouldn't hurt
to focus on the Buhrmans.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.456
Enough!

04:08.207 --> 04:10.083
Okay? That's our guy.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.085
Jesus Christ!

04:12.169 --> 04:16.173
Why is this such a leap for you?
He testified against his own son.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.801
He never visited for 19 years, and the
moment he does his son gets shanked.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.428
The man deserves to burn in hell!

04:28.185 --> 04:29.603
You got no proof, Pop.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.439
Just like you got no proof
that Owen killed Chuck.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.983
Then get me some, damn it.
That's why you're here.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.068
Get me some.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.572
You know what? I'm done with this shit.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.283
What?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.453
Markus!

04:50.916 --> 04:52.084
Markus.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.087
What's going on with you?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.756
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.551
-Speak your mind.
-All right.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.804
Your eyes are way off the main goal here.

05:03.887 --> 05:08.016
I mean, look at you.
You're hell-bent on burying Owen Cave.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.227
Clearly he's pushed some buttons in you.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.146
-I'm just going after the truth.
-Really.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.607
Okay, so now you don't want to
work with me anymore?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.660
You know,
I could've never given you any of this.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.830
No matter how hard I worked.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.374
I never asked you to.

05:34.126 --> 05:37.045
And Ingram and I worked for this together.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.964
I know, I know. Women's lib and all that.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.257
No, no, no, no.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.260
You understand we made choices

05:43.343 --> 05:46.680
and sacrifices and decisions
to live the way we wanted.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.350
As you can see,
there are no kids running around in here.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.602
Yeah, yeah.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.312
Listen.

05:55.272 --> 05:59.109
If you want me to keep digging, fine.
I'll dig.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.362
But we're playing
with people's lives here, Pop.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.740
Are you ready for the consequences?

06:36.146 --> 06:38.190
Hey, Mom. I didn't...

06:39.399 --> 06:41.026
I didn't know you were coming.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.404
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.823
This place is crawling with germs.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.909
I don't care.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.579
I had to see you.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.916
I know--

06:56.792 --> 06:59.253
Is your wound healing okay?

07:00.045 --> 07:01.088
Yeah.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.009
Did they find out who did it?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.597
No, Mom.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.647
I read this article the other day
in the library,

07:18.730 --> 07:20.107
and there's this...

07:20.732 --> 07:23.694
There's this cancer doctor out at USCF...

07:23.777 --> 07:26.280
No. No, Mom. Mom, listen.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.824
He's doing this new experimental treatment
that I think you should--

07:28.907 --> 07:29.908
No, Warren.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.246
It won't help.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.297
I'm sorry, sweetie, but I know.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.673
I just know.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.177
Mom.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.724
How's your garden?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.061
Tell me about it.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.931
Knew that would get ya.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.351
Heard from your father yet?

08:38.184 --> 08:40.312
I got nothing for him if I did.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.027
You trying to get me drunk?

08:47.110 --> 08:48.237
Oh, yeah.

08:49.613 --> 08:53.700
That podcast has been disrupting our life,

08:53.784 --> 08:58.038
so I... am going to disrupt it right back.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.627
Cheers.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.212
You're not slick.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.840
What?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.551
You got something brewing. I can see it.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.761
Can't a man want to spend a minute
with his wife?

09:17.683 --> 09:18.684
Come here.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.814
Come on. Follow me.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.275
Follow me.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.281
Damn it.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.702
-Yeah?
-So, how's the digging?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.246
Hey, Pop.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.209
I'm on it. I'm down at city hall.

10:26.502 --> 10:27.753
They're open this early?

10:27.836 --> 10:30.047
I gotta pick up my daughter
from school later.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.383
I didn't wanna have to
stand around in line all day.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.761
Well, I've been digging.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.764
Been looking into Owen's non-police life.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.642
The things at the margin.
You know, try to understand him better.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.102
And your shovel hit something.

10:45.354 --> 10:49.483
He's listed as the founder of
an organization called "Angel's Halo."

10:49.566 --> 10:50.901
Sounds angelic.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.612
Sounds bullshit. He's the only name on it.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.740
And when cops do public service stuff,
they promote it heavily.

10:56.823 --> 11:00.577
But this one's got nothing.
No footprint. A single donor.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.287
So what do you think it is?

11:02.371 --> 11:04.581
Well, that's what we have to find out.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.834
I'll text you the address.

11:06.917 --> 11:07.960
"We"?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.962
So we tag-teaming it again, huh?

11:10.045 --> 11:13.257
Another lucky day for you.
See you in 30 minutes.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.551
Back into the field with Markus?

11:16.802 --> 11:20.556
We're just trying to figure out
this Owen Cave stuff.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.434
We need to talk about your father.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.437
I plan to draw up a restraining order
against him.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.566
So you ganked me last night?

11:30.649 --> 11:34.027
Last night was real, and you know that.
So is this.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.112
That's my daddy.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.155
He put his hands on my wife.

11:37.239 --> 11:40.868
This is my family, Ingram.
You're not blood. You don't get a say!

11:49.668 --> 11:52.296
I heard you crying yourself to sleep.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.632
Your own father scared you, Poppy.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.764
Is there something you're not telling me?

12:15.611 --> 12:18.530
You know as well as I do
something needs to be done.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.492
I can't do it.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.494
You don't have to.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.663
I'll handle it.

12:29.124 --> 12:33.587
You're gonna have to work around him.
You can't go at him directly.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.631
Okay.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.184
I wish Susan hadn't made me executor.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.604
This is all very overwhelming.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.357
Well, why don't you let me help you?

12:54.399 --> 12:58.237
You know, you could move out of the hotel
and stay with us. Save some money.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.530
I'll think about it.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.000
Hello?

13:13.544 --> 13:15.128
Hello? Vivienne?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.673
I have to call you back.

13:17.756 --> 13:21.134
-What's going on? I haven't heard--
-I'll call you back. All right?

13:21.218 --> 13:22.427
Promise.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.808
Everything okay?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.478
Why would you do that?

13:31.562 --> 13:34.106
I mean, sorry. You won't tell me anything.

13:35.023 --> 13:38.193
I just wanna stay connected, you know.
I don't wanna lose you.

13:49.580 --> 13:53.625
-My God, this is all our stuff.
-I didn't know she kept everything.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.059
You used to love this.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.944
I like the name "Vivienne."

14:25.407 --> 14:27.784
The British accent kinda threw me, but...

14:28.577 --> 14:32.039
I really like the picture
of your husband and... son?

14:32.998 --> 14:34.333
You look real happy.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.924
Sorry. I really shouldn't have done that.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.264
I have to get out of here.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.517
What? What about all this stuff?

14:51.850 --> 14:54.144
Just lock it up. I'll meet you in the car.

15:01.485 --> 15:05.864
Angel's Halo is Owen Cave's business,
not mine.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.326
But its official address is here.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.371
That was just for the registration.
I helped him set it up. That's all.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.164
So what are you? His business manager?

15:15.290 --> 15:16.291
Christen!

15:17.042 --> 15:19.461
I advise Chief Cave, okay?

15:19.545 --> 15:20.546
Scan and shred.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.676
Look, if Angel's Halo is really legit,
you don't have to worry about--

15:25.759 --> 15:28.470
Everything that I do is above board here.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.180
You want information?

15:30.514 --> 15:32.140
Call Mr. Cave yourself.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.686
Thank you.

15:39.064 --> 15:41.441
Hey, I'll take another run at him later.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.277
Or try a softer target.

15:43.694 --> 15:44.987
What are you talking about?

15:45.737 --> 15:48.031
That receptionist was giving you
a lot of heat.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.116
Come on now.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.412
She was looking at you
the exact same way DeeDee Royce used to.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.665
DeeDee. That used to bother you.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.542
You only thought it bothered me.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.337
-Still picking up your daughter?
-Not for a while.

16:02.421 --> 16:05.424
Good. Then catch DeeDee 2.0
on one of her breaks

16:05.507 --> 16:09.178
and see if you can turn that heat
into some info on Owen.

16:09.928 --> 16:13.265
-I'll see what I can do.
-I bet you will.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.783
What's up?

16:31.867 --> 16:32.868
How are you?

16:34.953 --> 16:35.954
Lillian.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.459
You here for moonshine?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.419
Lookin' for you.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.171
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.674
We need to do something about Shreve.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.260
-Oh, please go on with all of that.
-Listen to me.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.512
I said no.

16:51.595 --> 16:54.806
I'm gonna file a restraining order
to keep him away from my wife.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.061
Y'all a trip.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.855
You and Poppy sure love the police.

17:03.232 --> 17:04.816
That ain't how we do things here.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.194
-I'm not the bad guy here.
-Really?

17:07.277 --> 17:08.694
No, I'm not.

17:10.113 --> 17:13.157
Now, we can leave the law out of this
on one condition.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.037
Make Shreve go see a doctor.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.666
Yeah.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.878
You know it yourself.

17:27.589 --> 17:31.093
He needs help. Lillian, he needs help.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.805
Anybody who's around him for five minutes
can see that.

17:40.394 --> 17:44.106
I guess I was just kinda hoping
that it would go away on its own.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.276
I even hoped it was drugs or alcohol.

17:52.489 --> 17:56.159
I just don't want it to be something
that takes him away from me.

17:57.703 --> 17:58.829
Yeah.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.582
I was 18 when I first saw Shreve.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.084
Right outside this bar.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.423
He was a giant to me.

18:11.550 --> 18:13.051
And he still is.

18:15.304 --> 18:18.515
Now, how do you talk to a giant
like he's a child?

18:41.914 --> 18:43.373
You have 40 minutes.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.088
Hey, Jax.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.257
Come on, boy.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.259
Jax?

18:54.343 --> 18:55.385
Warren...

18:56.762 --> 18:59.306
-Where's Jax?
-They didn't tell you?

19:00.057 --> 19:00.933
What?

19:01.934 --> 19:04.770
After what happened with Quiroga,
he was declared unsound.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.231
Unsound?

19:07.773 --> 19:09.024
He's being put down.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.068
What? You're killing him?

19:11.151 --> 19:13.904
The program has a zero tolerance policy,
and you know that.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.115
So take him out of the program!
He doesn't have to fucking die!

19:19.868 --> 19:20.953
I'm sorry.

19:22.913 --> 19:26.583
Is there someone I can talk to?
On his behalf?

19:27.626 --> 19:29.044
I'll see what I can do.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.508
See, you young bucks
don't know nothing about this scene.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.177
That's the reason why
I still love buying these.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.805
You haven't heard real music
until you've heard it on vinyl.

19:39.888 --> 19:45.018
I'm talking about E-40, Fab, Mac Dre.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.020
B-Legit.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.607
I don't see you as old, Daddy,
but you work really hard to sound like it.

19:50.691 --> 19:54.319
Oh, yeah? 'Cause I'm old-school.
That's where I'm from. I'm from the--

20:00.200 --> 20:03.745
Hey, baby, do me a favor.
Go sit in the car for me.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.290
-Daddy, what's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.166
-Everything's okay, sweetheart.
-Are you sure?

20:08.250 --> 20:10.252
I'm sure. I'll be right out.

20:19.678 --> 20:22.055
Markus Killebrew, formerly of OPD.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.558
I don't know that we ever met in person,

20:24.641 --> 20:26.643
but I've been told
you've taken quite an interest in me.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.061
Not the time, Chief.

20:29.438 --> 20:31.440
You tell Poppy Parnell to back off.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.818
You messed with her family,
so, you know, she's on your head.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.236
And you're okay with it?

20:36.778 --> 20:39.615
With her trying to ruin a fellow cop?
Smearing his reputation?

20:40.199 --> 20:42.576
I mean, my situation isn't quite like
what happened to you.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.454
I mean, I'm not a drunk
who accidentally shot the wrong--

20:45.537 --> 20:47.789
Hey, hey. I was cleared of that.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.209
It was a good shooting.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.045
So you chose to be a security guard
over a cop?

20:53.712 --> 20:55.464
Then it must have been your choice

20:55.547 --> 20:58.258
to give up custody
of your only daughter too, right?

21:01.929 --> 21:04.014
You tell Parnell to back away...

21:05.098 --> 21:06.975
or it goes bad for us all.

21:17.945 --> 21:20.322
-Still not here?
-Can you give him ten more minutes?

21:20.405 --> 21:24.368
We've already given him 30. I'm sorry.
Mr. Scoville will need to reschedule.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.623
I'm doing this MRI for Lillian.
Understand?

21:30.332 --> 21:31.458
Lillian.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.961
Understood.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.296
This way, Mr. Scoville.

21:37.756 --> 21:41.927
Poppy got you doin' her dirty work, huh?
Always was manipulative.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.762
-That's not what this is.
-That's bullshit.

21:43.846 --> 21:47.975
She been waiting 30 years to get back
at me for sticking her in foster care.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.143
-What?
-'Cept the shit I did back then

21:50.227 --> 21:51.353
was for her own good.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.648
Shreve.
Baby, please just go with the nurse, okay?

21:54.731 --> 21:56.149
Come on. Let's just go.

21:56.608 --> 22:00.654
Hey. What's all this about foster care?
What happened 30 years ago?

22:00.737 --> 22:02.948
You're gonna have to ask your wife
about that.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.959
-Hey.
-Hey, Poppy.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.170
He's right over there.

22:19.089 --> 22:21.800
Seriously?
You just had to drag me down here.

22:22.593 --> 22:23.927
Good a place as any.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.429
Leverage, right?

22:29.391 --> 22:30.350
All right.

22:31.268 --> 22:34.062
Angel's Halo is a 501-C.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.565
-A charity?
-Mm-hmm.

22:36.648 --> 22:41.153
Created by Owen Cave on November 29, 1999.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.489
Shit. That's a month
after Chuck Buhrman's murder.

22:44.573 --> 22:47.034
And he's been donating a grand a month
to this thing.

22:47.117 --> 22:49.661
Never missed a payment in 19 years.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.163
Is there a beneficiary?

22:51.246 --> 22:53.040
See, here's where it gets interesting.

22:53.123 --> 22:57.544
It only lists one-- A "JJJ."

22:57.628 --> 23:01.507
But I came up with shit
on who or whatever the hell that even is.

23:02.174 --> 23:03.467
Sounds like hush money.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.887
You were right. Cave is hiding something.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.055
I knew it.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.559
Hey, look...

23:14.937 --> 23:18.398
I just want to say I'm sorry for saying
all that stuff at the house the other day.

23:18.482 --> 23:19.983
-It wasn't...
-Look.

23:21.276 --> 23:22.319
I'm sorry too.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.242
You feel like taking a stroll
down memory lane?

23:31.453 --> 23:32.955
Take a look at that.

23:40.671 --> 23:43.298
I thought my daddy
was gonna pop a cap in your ass.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.175
Shit. I'm still afraid.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.095
That's why I only come around here
when he ain't around.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.945
-Madam Mayor.
-Owen.

24:05.362 --> 24:07.906
I'm sorry to surprise you like this,

24:07.990 --> 24:10.617
but I wanted to save you
a spectacle at the office.

24:11.660 --> 24:12.578
What's wrong?

24:12.661 --> 24:16.748
I'm putting you on a leave of absence
while we open an investigation.

24:23.547 --> 24:25.299
So, you leaving?

24:27.259 --> 24:29.052
Is that what Lanie told you?

24:29.136 --> 24:30.762
Well, she yelled it at me.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.141
Told me I was the reason
that you were leaving again.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.518
Okay, I really don't wanna do this here.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.645
My sister died, Josie.

24:39.104 --> 24:42.691
Give me a little grace here
just to say I'm sorry.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.822
I mean, how would you feel if Lanie died?

24:49.198 --> 24:52.701
Oh, my God.
Do you ever give yourself the creeps?

25:01.502 --> 25:05.130
Lanie told me that you saw the painting
I did of you in Susan's storage space,

25:05.214 --> 25:07.966
and since I can't have
the two of you in the flesh,

25:08.050 --> 25:10.093
I would at least like to have that.

25:12.763 --> 25:17.142
Okay. I paid the manager a hundred bucks
to throw everything out.

25:17.226 --> 25:20.062
So if you want it,
you should go sooner rather than later.

25:23.482 --> 25:24.399
Thank you.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.393
Oh, shit.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.537
What do you mean by "dead-end"?

26:18.620 --> 26:21.248
It takes time. I know we'll get there.

26:21.331 --> 26:24.126
No, you told me that you had him.

26:25.043 --> 26:27.588
The blood on his shoes.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.381
I know he's guilty, Warren.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.593
But you have nothing.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.428
Not yet, but we are onto something.

26:34.511 --> 26:38.140
We found a charity that he's been
donating a thousand bucks a month to

26:38.223 --> 26:39.725
for the past 19 years.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.560
Okay, so that's all you got.

26:42.728 --> 26:44.271
A fucking tax deduction.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.815
He started it right after Chuck's murder.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.818
He's the only donor and all
the money's going to the same person.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.111
It's gotta be hush money.

26:51.195 --> 26:53.530
All right, so who's the money going to?

26:54.907 --> 26:57.117
That's the part we don't know yet.

26:57.201 --> 27:00.078
All we have are initials: "JJJ."

27:02.915 --> 27:04.333
-Shit.
-What?

27:11.006 --> 27:12.049
Warren?

27:14.051 --> 27:15.469
There was this...

27:16.094 --> 27:18.680
kid around my block.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.892
I knew him my whole life.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.811
Big football star.

27:27.105 --> 27:29.316
Everyone called him "Tre-J."

27:30.442 --> 27:33.654
John James Jackson.

27:33.737 --> 27:36.740
John James Jackson.

27:41.161 --> 27:45.082
There are wounds
from which we never recover.

27:45.624 --> 27:50.295
They strike you on the surface,
but quickly burrow deep into the soul

27:50.379 --> 27:55.509
and metastasize into something darker.

27:55.592 --> 28:00.097
Might the wound of a truth have burrowed
deep into the soul of Owen Cave?

28:00.180 --> 28:05.435
Metastasized into the most
unforgivable sin against his own child?

28:20.284 --> 28:21.451
We need to talk.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.746
I'm taking Henry to my mother's.

28:25.414 --> 28:27.124
I'm not sure when we're coming back.

28:41.263 --> 28:46.268
"Some people think you're born bad.
But I don't think that's true.

28:46.685 --> 28:48.729
I know Jax wasn't born that way,

28:48.812 --> 28:52.232
and he doesn't deserve to die
just because he made a mistake.

28:54.610 --> 28:58.739
Being locked up in a cage
can make anyone vicious,

28:59.323 --> 29:02.618
'cause the only way to survive
is to fight...

29:05.287 --> 29:06.496
to be bad."

29:07.581 --> 29:08.749
He...

29:16.965 --> 29:18.467
I'm sorry.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.470
Look...

29:23.222 --> 29:24.848
Jax, he...

29:26.141 --> 29:27.142
he trusted me.

29:29.102 --> 29:33.232
In 19 years, he was the only one.

29:34.483 --> 29:38.320
Jax attacked because he thought
he was protecting someone...

29:40.739 --> 29:41.740
he loved.

29:41.823 --> 29:42.866
Aus, Jax!

29:45.285 --> 29:49.289
You know,
my own father wouldn't do that for me.

29:52.417 --> 29:56.839
Look, maybe that means
he can't be in your program.

29:59.424 --> 30:02.553
But that doesn't mean
he should have to die.

30:09.101 --> 30:11.061
Have you looked at our web page lately?

30:11.895 --> 30:16.316
There's a guy says he has info
on the murder. Chris Harkin.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.319
And every one we've gotten thus far
has been useless.

30:19.403 --> 30:22.781
Yeah, but this one's not claiming he has
the answer like the nutjobs do, just info.

30:22.865 --> 30:23.866
He wants to meet.

30:24.616 --> 30:27.369
Wait, you just warned me
about these Internet lynch mobs

30:27.452 --> 30:29.621
and now you're talking about
meeting with one?

30:29.705 --> 30:30.831
All for the cause.

30:45.095 --> 30:46.763
-Thank you.
-Hey.

30:48.223 --> 30:51.268
I thought you might wanna say good-bye
before we bring him to the shelter.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.604
-Hey, Jax.
-You did it, Warren.

30:53.687 --> 30:57.441
-You saved his life.
-Hey, hey. That's a good boy.

30:58.650 --> 30:59.985
It's okay, bud.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.696
They'll find you a good home.

31:04.364 --> 31:05.365
Let's go.

31:25.427 --> 31:28.096
-Are you okay?
-I think my career is over.

31:29.515 --> 31:32.643
Alana's leaving me.
She's taking Henry with her.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.777
All the heat from the podcast
became too much for her.

31:43.195 --> 31:47.783
You know, in 12 years of marriage,
she hardly ever mentioned Warren.

31:49.201 --> 31:52.079
She always wanted me looking forward.

31:52.871 --> 31:55.290
Or she was just protecting herself.

31:57.167 --> 32:00.420
You're the only one that truly got me.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.300
That was a long time ago.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.512
I should've been here for you.

32:09.221 --> 32:11.640
You shouldn't have to go through all this
alone.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.434
-Yeah, I manage okay.
-Goddamn woman.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.062
Started stirring up this shit
all over again.

32:17.145 --> 32:19.982
She's trying to help Warren.
Nobody else will.

32:20.899 --> 32:24.069
Can you forgive me?
For destroying everything?

32:24.152 --> 32:25.320
Don't say that. Just...

32:25.404 --> 32:29.575
I was so focused on work.
Trying to make chief.

32:29.658 --> 32:31.368
I ignored you. I drove you to Chuck.

32:31.451 --> 32:34.371
-Don't talk like that.
-Then I put our only son in prison.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.081
I mean, who does that, Melanie?

32:36.498 --> 32:38.792
I just couldn't keep
my fuckin' mouth shut.

32:38.876 --> 32:40.961
I was so noble, so righteous!

32:41.795 --> 32:43.755
-And all that time--
-What?

32:46.008 --> 32:48.635
"All that time," what?

32:54.057 --> 32:57.519
-He's my son. He's our son.
-I know. It's okay.

32:57.603 --> 32:58.854
Owen, it's okay.

32:58.937 --> 33:01.690
-It's okay. You're okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

33:01.773 --> 33:05.194
-What are you doing? Stop!
-I'm sorry!

33:05.277 --> 33:07.487
You want comfort from me

33:07.571 --> 33:10.574
now that your shiny life
has just suddenly fallen apart?

33:10.657 --> 33:14.161
You left us. Owen, you left us.

33:14.244 --> 33:16.788
You took everything from me and Warren.

33:18.916 --> 33:22.586
I'm the only one that understood you.
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:22.669 --> 33:25.422
You stole 19 years of my life!

33:25.506 --> 33:26.798
Nineteen years!

33:30.093 --> 33:31.428
I'm sorry.

33:31.512 --> 33:33.305
I don't care about you.

33:33.388 --> 33:35.807
Get out of my-- Just get out of my house.

33:36.225 --> 33:38.560
Get out of my house! Get out!

33:52.324 --> 33:53.659
-Hey.
-Hi.

33:59.665 --> 34:02.292
So have you decided
how long you're staying?

34:02.376 --> 34:04.837
I was actually thinking about that,

34:04.920 --> 34:09.007
and then Mom came to see me.

34:09.842 --> 34:11.260
Yeah, I know.

34:12.761 --> 34:14.054
I'm so sorry.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.266
That woman.

34:19.810 --> 34:22.980
Even her best efforts
feel like an assault.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.820
I don't know, Lanie.
There's just too many memories here.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.239
You know? It's so toxic.

34:33.489 --> 34:34.533
Okay.

34:35.951 --> 34:37.327
Thought I'd give it one more try.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.498
You will come say good-bye
to Ella though, right?

34:42.583 --> 34:44.835
I mean, she really likes her aunt.

34:44.918 --> 34:45.960
Of course I will.

34:52.676 --> 34:54.428
Don't wanna get too used to that.

35:19.661 --> 35:20.871
Hey, Siri.

35:25.167 --> 35:26.251
Call "Home."

35:26.335 --> 35:27.544
Calling "Home."

35:34.927 --> 35:36.094
Hey, Vivienne.

35:40.057 --> 35:42.768
Mr. Jackson
doesn't get many visitors anymore.

35:42.851 --> 35:45.103
-You family?
-A friend of mine tracked him down.

35:45.187 --> 35:47.147
She asked me to say hello.

35:47.231 --> 35:48.607
Nice of her, yeah.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.526
His family used to come every day.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.194
But the past few years...

35:53.237 --> 35:54.905
birthdays and Christmases.

36:07.459 --> 36:10.003
-Jesus.
-It was a hit-and-run.

36:11.421 --> 36:13.799
He was walking home
from a Halloween party.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.634
Driver hits him, panics...

36:16.844 --> 36:19.263
leaves him twisted
and bleeding in the street.

36:20.347 --> 36:22.683
And Angel's Halo pays for all of this?

36:22.766 --> 36:24.017
Every dime.

36:54.590 --> 36:57.009
Markus, hey, it's Poppy.

36:57.092 --> 36:59.428
Holler back, please? Thanks.

37:08.228 --> 37:09.396
Ingram?

37:17.070 --> 37:18.071
Babe?

37:19.239 --> 37:20.866
I thought you were working late.

37:24.536 --> 37:28.207
You know we can play that upstairs
after we eat, right?

37:50.270 --> 37:51.480
Join me.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.357
Have a seat.

37:57.861 --> 38:01.740
Now, this may not be as high tech
as you're used to, but it'll do.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.410
For what?

38:06.453 --> 38:10.207
You are gonna record a retraction.

38:17.130 --> 38:20.300
"Owen Cave was a good father to Warren.

38:20.384 --> 38:23.554
But his son had problems.

38:24.012 --> 38:25.514
Everyone saw it.

38:26.515 --> 38:29.017
Except Owen's wife, Melanie.

38:31.144 --> 38:34.815
Owen looked the other way with his son
for years.

38:35.399 --> 38:38.235
Until that one night when Warren..."

38:40.070 --> 38:41.572
I'm sorry. I can't say...

38:42.030 --> 38:45.033
You can't say my son killed Chuck Buhrman?
I thought you were all about the truth?

38:45.117 --> 38:47.452
-I'm just trying to help you here--
-Bullshit!

38:48.120 --> 38:50.539
You destroyed my life.
You destroyed my family.

38:50.622 --> 38:52.791
You will say whatever
the fuck I tell you to! Read it!

38:52.875 --> 38:55.127
I just... meant...

38:56.461 --> 38:58.672
that your story is incomplete.

38:59.631 --> 39:03.093
If you wanna clear your name,
we have to give the audience more.

39:03.177 --> 39:05.304
More? More?

39:06.680 --> 39:09.725
Like tell 'em how it feels
to destroy your own blood like I did?

39:09.808 --> 39:13.437
How it costs you something
you will never get back?

39:14.855 --> 39:19.902
All of this so that I wouldn't find out
the truth about Angel's Halo?

39:23.030 --> 39:26.783
That was an accident. That fucking kid
ran right in front of my car.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.619
John James Jackson?

39:31.163 --> 39:35.417
That's what happened
during those... 74 minutes.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.128
You could've told the police.

39:38.212 --> 39:42.299
And see my career go down the toilet
because some stupid, idiot kid

39:42.382 --> 39:45.511
was wearing a black costume
that no one could see?

39:45.844 --> 39:47.763
For 20 years everything was fine...

39:48.472 --> 39:51.099
until you showed up and fucked it all up!

39:53.936 --> 39:55.229
I'm a good man.

39:56.438 --> 39:59.775
That's why I got Tre-J taken care of.
I got him in the best facility.

39:59.858 --> 40:02.361
And why I got Warren
into that dog program,

40:02.444 --> 40:03.987
even though he didn't know!

40:05.614 --> 40:07.449
Whether you like it or not...

40:08.158 --> 40:10.160
my son killed Chuck Buhrman,

40:10.577 --> 40:12.663
and I was right to put him in jail.

40:13.705 --> 40:15.415
'Cause I'm a good man.

40:16.542 --> 40:17.543
Oh, God!

40:17.626 --> 40:20.379
You tell the audience I was a good man.

40:38.313 --> 40:40.607
-Poppy?
-Sir, excuse me.

40:40.691 --> 40:42.901
Poppy! Where's my wife?

40:44.027 --> 40:45.612
Sir, I'm gonna need you to come back here.

40:45.696 --> 40:47.614
-Please!
-Poppy! Where's my wife?

40:47.698 --> 40:50.993
-Hey! A police officer died here tonight.
-Where the fuck is my wife?

40:51.076 --> 40:52.077
Ingram.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.122
My father once told me

40:55.205 --> 40:59.251
that a man will do one of two things
when he's backed into a corner--

40:59.334 --> 41:00.335
Are you okay?

41:00.419 --> 41:03.630
...lie down and die, or come out fighting.

41:04.214 --> 41:06.550
That's how you take a man's measure,

41:06.633 --> 41:08.719
find out who he really is.

41:08.802 --> 41:11.722
You put him in a corner
and see what he does.

41:11.805 --> 41:13.849
Unless he's got nothing left to lose.

41:13.932 --> 41:15.225
Now that...

41:16.059 --> 41:18.437
That's the man you don't wanna mess with,

41:18.520 --> 41:21.940
because he will come out fighting
every time.

41:22.691 --> 41:24.693
But his fight will be to the death.

41:26.612 --> 41:29.823
His... and yours.

41:36.371 --> 41:39.458
Oh, my God, Poppy.
You're not gonna wanna hear this.

41:39.541 --> 41:43.587
I just spoke to the street sweeper
who saw Warren the night of the murder,

41:43.670 --> 41:46.423
leaving the Buhrman house with a knife.

41:47.216 --> 41:49.927
This is our worst nightmare.
Owen was right.

41:50.636 --> 41:52.971
Warren did it. He killed Chuck.

41:53.055 --> 41:54.765
Poppy, you have to call me back.
