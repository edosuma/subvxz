WEBVTT

01:19.204 --> 01:21.664
The big question is,
how aggressive do you want to be?

01:22.290 --> 01:24.918
Very aggressive.
We don't want to lose any more time.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.796
You've been trying for... two years?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.005
And four months.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.384
I have the app monitoring ovulation,

01:33.802 --> 01:35.512
taking temperature and mucus levels,

01:35.595 --> 01:38.431
we've been planning and pacing
intercourse.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.183
It's been very romantic.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.603
So we're looking at IUI or IVF.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.523
-IUI is the least invasive.
-And outpatient.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.482
IUI...?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.652
Didn't you read the thing?
I told you to read it.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.988
Intrauterine insemination. The sperm
are injected directly into the uterus.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.407
-And yes, it's outpatient
-Let's start there.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.660
-You're 39, Steven?
-Uh-huh.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.996
Okay, we'll test your sperm
for count and motility percentage.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.958
And how far away are we
from your period, Leigh?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.335
It's unpredictable.
A week, maybe ten days.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.129
Your cycle's unpredictable?

02:10.588 --> 02:11.548
Is that a problem?

02:12.298 --> 02:13.800
Possibly, possibly not.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.010
That and your age are all factors.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.888
Over 35, the situation
becomes more difficult.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.015
But very often it's manageable.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.518
But it might be likely
that based on your test results,

02:23.601 --> 02:25.019
we go straight to in vitro.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.773
-Will Insurance help with that?
-Most companies won't cover IVF,

02:28.857 --> 02:32.152
but very often the genetic testing
for the man will be covered.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.611
Oh, that sounds fair.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.990
All right, so, Steven,
when can we schedule your tests?

02:37.073 --> 02:38.241
Which tests?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.619
A blood panel for chromosomal diagnosis,

02:41.703 --> 02:42.829
a sample of your semen.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.497
When did you last ejaculate?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.249
A week.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.834
Maybe less.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.127
No, it's two weeks.

02:49.669 --> 02:50.503
When--

02:53.173 --> 02:55.216
We'll need to reschedule it
for another time.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.260
We need you within
three to five days after.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.057
Homework, honey.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.981
We gotta talk.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.609
About what?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.111
Steve?

03:17.655 --> 03:18.489
Steve!

03:19.616 --> 03:20.450
Steve.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.119
Steve!

03:26.748 --> 03:28.291
Oh. I'm sorry.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.670
-I'll just--
-I can fix this.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.924
No, I don't want to cancel it,
I just wanted a usage alert.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.010
So you'll text me next time it's used?

03:40.511 --> 03:41.596
Okay. Thanks.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.307
He hasn't used the credit card yet.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.267
They're going to send me an alert
when he does.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.019
We can get a location from that.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.355
God, I hope he...

03:50.772 --> 03:53.942
just tries an ATM and doesn't
trade the card for dope.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.193
Does he have your PIN?

03:55.902 --> 03:56.778
Are you kidding?

03:56.861 --> 03:58.238
Why would he try an ATM?

03:58.529 --> 04:01.199
I'm sorry, Steve.
Do you have a better suggestion?

04:01.449 --> 04:03.493
He took the card to use the card,

04:03.576 --> 04:05.078
and now we'll know if he does.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.707
He didn't have to break the house.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.960
No, I don't think he did.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.294
Me neither.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.505
Someone ask you what you think, Theodora?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.006
Sorry.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.342
If it wasn't Luke, who was it?

04:19.425 --> 04:20.718
Maybe one of your kids.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.595
Yeah, that makes sense.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.930
It's probably my kids.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.141
Or maybe it was the guy
who just stole a car

04:27.225 --> 04:28.393
to put a needle in his arm.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.270
I'm worried about
a lot more than that.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.479
What do you mean?

04:31.562 --> 04:35.233
I mean, that suicides
can cluster in families,

04:35.566 --> 04:36.734
especially twins.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.195
If they lose a twin,

04:39.570 --> 04:40.822
the odds go up.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.993
He may not be planning to come home.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.162
Where-- Where would he go?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.372
He could be anywhere.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.127
He was picked up off Mass Ave a few times
when he was living here.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.045
Methadone Mile.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.257
-What's that?
-Mass Ave, south of downtown.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.968
It's basically an open-air drug market.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.428
I remember it.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.514
-I'll go look for him.
-It's a waste of gas.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.808
-He could be anywhere.
-Yeah, I'll go with you.

05:08.891 --> 05:09.726
I got this.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.060
Just wait a bit.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.229
-We'll see if he's using the card.
-Call me if he does.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.981
Are you gonna drive in circles?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.942
-Hope he's standing on some corner?
-Maybe, I don't know.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.945
We're really not going to tell them
what we saw?

05:25.783 --> 05:26.784
Damn it, Luke.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.419
We going or what?

05:37.879 --> 05:38.880
I just want to help.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.633
I just want to help.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.845
Look, bud, I know you do,

05:46.012 --> 05:48.556
but I'm gonna start using
some really strong chemicals down here...

05:49.640 --> 05:50.808
...and it just isn't safe.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.852
I can help with something else, then.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.354
Look, pal,

05:55.688 --> 05:57.523
I've already hired all the help
I can afford

05:57.607 --> 05:59.859
just to get everything else
finished by the end of summer.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.906
I could use your help
with something, though.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.074
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:07.075 --> 06:10.787
See, your mom's going to go
to your Aunt Janet's in a few days

06:11.329 --> 06:12.330
and stay a bit.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.331
Maybe a week.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.375
How come?

06:16.584 --> 06:19.837
Well, you know, she's been cooped up
in this house all summer and...

06:20.630 --> 06:22.590
Anyway, I know it's not
the most exciting thing,

06:22.673 --> 06:25.009
but I could really use your help

06:25.093 --> 06:27.637
watching your brother and your sisters
while she's away.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.430
Yeah.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.640
Yeah, I got you.

06:31.057 --> 06:31.974
Okay.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.714
Mom?

07:03.965 --> 07:05.758
What do you mean, sweetheart?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.511
Of course you're safe with me.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.430
-Mom.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.516
Are you okay?

07:15.726 --> 07:16.561
Where...

07:16.644 --> 07:17.812
Where are the twins?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.147
Downstairs.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.109
Of course.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.862
-Are you sure--?
-I'm fine, sweetie. I'm fine.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.514
Okay, thanks.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.268
Well, he's-- he's not at Holy Family.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.937
We'll, he's probably not going to
instantly OD.

08:00.104 --> 08:03.149
You're going to call every hospital
in Boston

08:03.232 --> 08:06.527
What, you're going to just drive around,
hope we spot him in a city of 700,000--?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.947
I'm not looking for him.
I'm looking for a beat-up green Jeep

08:10.031 --> 08:12.658
with not one, but two Ani DiFranco
bumper stickers,

08:12.742 --> 08:14.785
and I'm looking for it
where I know he used to score.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.829
Gotta do something.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.581
Yeah, we do.

08:21.792 --> 08:22.627
So, um...

08:24.670 --> 08:25.755
What's going on?

08:25.963 --> 08:28.174
Hmm

08:28.257 --> 08:29.300
What do you mean?

08:29.884 --> 08:30.885
Well, I mean...

08:31.886 --> 08:32.887
how's your marriage?

08:33.387 --> 08:35.264
You're kidding, right?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.474
You're not living at home,

08:36.557 --> 08:38.351
and I couldn't help but notice
at the funeral--

08:38.434 --> 08:41.354
-You aren't seriously doing this.
-Well, yeah, I am. I--

08:41.437 --> 08:43.814
Jesus Christ, Dad, you're out of line.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.360
We might be in the car for a while,
and so I thought to myself,

08:47.443 --> 08:49.946
"I'm going to ask my son about his life."
What's wrong with that?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.405
Doesn't work that way, Dad.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.911
Your mom and I were married 15 years.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.374
Together five before that.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.712
She used to say she was the kite
and I was the line.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.966
She was a... creature of the clouds

09:10.049 --> 09:13.135
and... and I was a creature of the earth.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.390
And she'd say that without me
she'd become untethered

09:17.473 --> 09:19.433
and she would float away up into the...

09:20.351 --> 09:22.562
And then without her,
I would just, you know,

09:22.895 --> 09:25.189
crash, just drop right down
to the ground,

09:25.273 --> 09:26.649
and, you know.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.151
But... together...

09:31.237 --> 09:32.238
we...

09:37.702 --> 09:38.953
You know, we separated.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.497
You... You didn't know that, probably.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.251
Briefly, we separated.
You were one year old.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.587
Stupidest thing I ever did.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.256
You know, I made some stupid
proclamation and that was it.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.340
Two weeks.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.178
Two weeks. I don't even know how
we got there. I just know we fought.

09:56.262 --> 10:00.141
I don't know what we fought about,
but I finally came to my senses, and...

10:02.893 --> 10:05.855
I thought, "What the hell,
you stupid asshole. What are you, insane?"

10:05.980 --> 10:08.441
So, you know, I came back
and knocked on the door,

10:08.524 --> 10:10.735
she answered it,
she put her arms around me,

10:10.860 --> 10:13.362
she kissed me,
she forgave me with her eyes, and...

10:14.822 --> 10:15.698
She handed you to me.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.701
I had you in one arm
and her in the other and that was it.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.040
We were back at it.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.460
And Shirley came along and...

10:29.086 --> 10:30.963
from that moment on,
we were on the same team.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.923
You know, we still fought sometimes,

10:33.674 --> 10:34.634
but it was...

10:34.967 --> 10:37.720
it was different. We fought with love.
She taught me that.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.722
You fight with love.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.140
Yeah, when you're...

10:43.517 --> 10:46.312
You're on the same team
even in the middle of a fight.

10:46.771 --> 10:47.647
During the fight,

10:48.397 --> 10:49.940
you're... you're forgiven.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.526
There's no fear. There's no danger.
You're safe.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.781
I hope, really, you get to
experience that sometime.

10:57.031 --> 10:57.990
It's a...

10:58.491 --> 10:59.867
It's a beautiful way to be.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.122
You know, look, we weren't perfect...

11:07.291 --> 11:08.876
but we were always kind.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.962
And we loved each other hard.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.009
And I love her today
just as much as I did in the beginning.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.806
The kite and the line.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.021
So whatever you need to fix
between you and Leigh...

11:31.232 --> 11:32.733
I really hope you do.

11:36.570 --> 11:37.488
And...

11:39.407 --> 11:41.534
That's all I... That's all I really
wanted to say.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.997
Candy, candy, candy, candy!

11:47.748 --> 11:49.250
Sure you won't come with us?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.292
You guys have fun.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.169
Come on, Mom, candy!

11:52.253 --> 11:54.672
We'll bring her back some.
Mom's had a very hard day.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.507
Would you stop that?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.510
I'm still disappointed you're not going
as Captain Lame.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.512
I swear to God, Dad.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.055
Candy, candy, candy!

12:03.723 --> 12:04.557
Hey.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.892
Can we talk when I get back?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.104
How? You'll be back at the hotel.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.273
Okay.

12:13.607 --> 12:14.483
Okay, Shirl.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.319
Stop.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.572
-Let's go.
-Turn off the porch light.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.657
I can't handle trick-or-treaters tonight.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.494
I love you.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.247
You guys have fun.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.154
What the hell?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.543
Sorry, no candy here.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.719
Goddamn light's off.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.201
I'm gonna call the hospitals again.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.703
-Maybe he just forgot his ID.
-And ask them what?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.580
If they've seen a junkie
in a funeral suit?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.958
He's 90 days clean
and he's your brother.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.251
He's a good man, Steve.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.836
They're not mutually exclusive.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.421
He's my brother, but he's a junkie.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.009
We're not going to find him like this.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.719
-You didn't have to come.
-Yeah, I did.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.972
-No, you really didn't.
-Yeah, I did, Steve.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.184
He's my son. You know? My...

14:12.518 --> 14:15.354
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost him, any of you.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.775
Yeah, I had to come.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.945
I can't... I can't lose...

14:24.196 --> 14:25.447
I can't lose anyone else.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.327
One day when you have children,
you'll understand that.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.329
I'm never having children.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.749
Well, that's... that's a shame.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.295
'Cause you kids are the best thing
in my life.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.046
You mean Aunt Janet's life?

14:41.422 --> 14:43.257
She's the one who raised your kids,
didn't she?

14:43.340 --> 14:45.426
-You don't know what it was like.
-You never told me.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.177
Everything I did, I did to protect you.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.054
To protect us, I know, yeah.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.598
Just like you protected Mom.

14:52.766 --> 14:53.684
Here we go.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.436
I saw the police reports.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.817
-Her skull cracked like a melon--
-All right, Steve, why don't you just--?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.653
There was blood all over
the library carpet.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.364
There were bruises on her upper arms

15:07.448 --> 15:09.867
because someone
grabbed her pretty hard.

15:09.950 --> 15:10.868
Okay, Steve--

15:10.951 --> 15:14.622
And a contusion on the back of her head
from being shoved into a wall?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.250
Her ankle was twisted,
so she was limping,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.669
she was bruised to hell,
depressed out of her mind,

15:20.753 --> 15:23.881
unmedicated, untreated,
and abandoned.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.466
It wasn't like that.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.676
I did my best. You have no idea--

15:27.760 --> 15:29.970
You threw us in car,
you left her there alone,

15:30.054 --> 15:32.598
and she threw herself
off the goddamn staircase,

15:32.681 --> 15:33.724
and that was your best?

15:33.807 --> 15:36.393
All right, well, she should not
have been left alone in the house--

15:36.477 --> 15:39.188
Fuck the house. It wasn't the house.
She was sick.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.316
She was sick in her mind,
and the one person,

15:42.399 --> 15:44.777
the one person that was supposed
to take care of her

15:44.860 --> 15:47.738
didn't do a goddamn thing
to get her help.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.536
I miss her.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.582
I miss my mom.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.796
I miss her too.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.718
It's certainly beautiful.
Where did you find it?

16:11.095 --> 16:11.971
The game room.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.348
-The what room?
-Upstairs.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.184
You know, I think a little paint,
maybe fix those doors,

16:17.267 --> 16:19.770
-and she might really love it.
-I'm sure she will.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.815
So do you know
where the paint and stuff is?

16:22.982 --> 16:26.026
-Why don't you ask your father?
-I did. He's busy.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.988
He said if it wasn't tagged for sale,
I could do whatever I wanted.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.572
And it's not tagged for sale.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.742
Well, I do know where some paint is.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.623
I thought so.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.126
This must have been Poppy's.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.502
Poppy?

16:44.878 --> 16:45.921
Poppy Hill.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.590
She was William's wife.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.551
She was insane.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.053
Yeah, she looks kind of wild.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.805
No, I mean clinically.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.223
So was he.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.352
William's parents sent him
to an institution when he was a kid.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.439
They called it private school,
but it wasn't a school, though.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.650
It was just a place where rich parents
hid their embarrassments.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.404
They met in the mental institution.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.531
They fell in love in an asylum.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.283
She was insane.

17:15.784 --> 17:16.785
Did you know her?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.204
Oh, yes.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.832
She was just as crazy, just older.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.755
She was a beautiful young woman
in her time, though.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.340
No doubt about that.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.852
If you really want this to be a surprise
for your mom,

17:42.603 --> 17:44.772
I'd suggest you don't work on it
in your room.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.916
Just take the fucking candy and go.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.564
You're very clever.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.233
How about you try another house?

19:11.316 --> 19:12.943
I'm not in the fucking mood!

19:44.308 --> 19:46.101
What the fuck do you want?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.688
Oh... Oh.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.524
I was just coming to apologize.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.652
Who are you yelling at?

19:57.571 --> 19:58.947
Some fucking kids are...

20:00.407 --> 20:01.241
Forget it.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.250
-Wait.
-Not now.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.919
-I can explain.
-I doubt that.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.671
-Shouldn't you be packing?
-I know what it looked like last night.

20:14.755 --> 20:18.050
-You were making out with my husband.
-No. No, there was no actual...

20:18.133 --> 20:21.303
Okay, so from what I can remember,
which isn't a lot actually,

20:21.386 --> 20:22.304
he pushed me away.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.848
-Is that supposed to make this better?
-If it wasn't even him.

20:25.098 --> 20:28.018
It wasn't... I didn't see him.
It wasn't about him.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.229
It's about you getting out of
my guest house

20:30.312 --> 20:31.563
and off my fucking property.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.816
-If you would just let me talk.
-I don't care what you have to say.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.194
Don't you understand? Get out!

20:37.277 --> 20:38.737
You are impossible.
Do you know that?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.197
I'm sorry, have I offended you?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.991
You are always throwing it in my face
that I live in your guest house.

20:43.075 --> 20:43.992
Won't happen again.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.953
I choose to live there, Shirley.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.956
-With you, for you.
-Oh, I can't thank you enough.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.207
You ice people out.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.208
You always have.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.542
I ice people out?

20:52.626 --> 20:54.002
Have you met yourself?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.713
And so I chose to live there
to help try and keep you warm.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.465
You fucking suck at apologies.

20:58.548 --> 21:02.052
I don't have to live in your guest house.
I'm not some bohemian weirdo.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.220
I'm an adult.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.846
I am a fucking doctor.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.390
You're a fucking slut.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.226
I just need you to know

21:09.726 --> 21:11.853
that it wasn't Kevin's fault
and he didn't do anything--

21:11.937 --> 21:14.231
Don't you fucking dare
defend my husband.

21:14.314 --> 21:16.942
All of us, all of us are just always
helping you

21:17.025 --> 21:19.820
keep up this idea in your head
that you're perfect Shirley,

21:19.903 --> 21:21.863
and we're just a bunch
of fuck-ups fucking up.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.283
-Perfect Shirley's perfect fucking--
-Out!

21:24.825 --> 21:25.742
No!

21:25.826 --> 21:28.078
You do not just get to shut me
out of your--

21:32.916 --> 21:34.626
Did you just punch me in the boob?

21:36.503 --> 21:37.337
Yeah.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.381
Yeah!

21:40.173 --> 21:42.217
If you kiss my husband,
that's what you get.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.386
You get punched
in the fucking boob.

21:45.012 --> 21:45.929
And you get evicted

21:46.013 --> 21:47.764
-from my fucking house.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.210
Shirl?

22:59.002 --> 23:00.045
What's up?

23:00.879 --> 23:01.713
They...

23:04.257 --> 23:05.175
Sorry, they...

23:06.885 --> 23:07.928
They got a hit.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.765
He used the card at a gas station.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.643
202, just east of Amherst.

23:15.936 --> 23:16.770
Amherst?

23:17.104 --> 23:17.938
Um...

23:18.105 --> 23:19.815
Can you text me the address?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.611
-Shirl?
-Yeah.

23:24.903 --> 23:25.946
I'm here. Sorry.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.033
Yeah, I'll... I'll text you the address.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.829
-Amherst is on the way--
-Yeah, I know where it is.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.248
You guys are gonna stay there,
we're gonna go to Amherst.

23:36.331 --> 23:39.668
I'm saying, if he's stopping in Amherst,
he's heading--

23:39.751 --> 23:41.837
Shirley, listen to me,
you're gonna stay put.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.755
-You hear me?
-Tell them what happened.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.341
Tell them what just happened.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.010
I'll text you.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.432
Some fucking kids playing a prank
is what happened.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.516
You know it wasn't.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.059
You know that.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.730
That's not the only thing like that
that's happened here tonight.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.446
I think Luke is going to the house.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.739
Of course he is.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.409
The goddamn house.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.121
It was a good enough spot for Nell,
it's a good enough spot for Luke.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.582
He always wanted to do what she did
his whole life.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.916
-You think you know.
-Uh-huh.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.918
And you just don't,
you don't understand.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.837
Last time I saw Mom,

24:24.588 --> 24:25.881
the look in her eye,

24:26.298 --> 24:27.382
I've seen that look.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.927
And Nell over the years, and Luke,
from the start,

24:31.011 --> 24:34.514
from when he'd sit there
drawing crazy ghouls in his treehouse,

24:34.598 --> 24:37.017
and, hell, I've seen that look
in the mirror.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.855
Our family has a disease
that's never been treated,

24:41.938 --> 24:44.483
because it was easier
to listen to your crazy stories

24:44.566 --> 24:45.609
about an evil house.

24:48.111 --> 24:51.198
You think you saw it in the mirror

24:51.281 --> 24:52.824
Oh, I know I'm never having children.

24:52.908 --> 24:56.077
Because you think that they'll
just have the same imaginary sickness?

24:56.161 --> 24:58.205
They would. We all do.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.665
Nell was delusional, depressed,

25:00.749 --> 25:03.668
Luke's an addict,
Shirley is a control freak,

25:03.752 --> 25:06.630
and Theo's basically
a clenched fist with hair.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.258
The whole fucking family
is on the brink of a breakdown

25:10.342 --> 25:13.512
and seeing things that aren't there,
hearing things that aren't there,

25:13.595 --> 25:16.056
and that shit happened after the house.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.307
It's not the house.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.018
There's something wrong
with our goddamn brains.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.145
So yeah, I'm never having children.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.648
I made sure.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.194
A vasectomy.

25:31.738 --> 25:32.739
Right out of college.

25:34.199 --> 25:37.285
And it was the right call, believe me,
because if I ever doubted it,

25:37.369 --> 25:40.455
some of the bullshit
I've been hallucinating this week...

25:43.041 --> 25:44.000
You really did?

25:45.085 --> 25:45.919
Yeah.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.798
Before you met Leigh?

25:53.969 --> 25:54.886
Boy.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.806
You didn't tell her?

25:59.599 --> 26:00.684
You didn't tell her.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.061
No.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.023
She wanted kids, I knew that.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.944
I kept thinking, "I'll tell her later,
now's not the time."

26:13.613 --> 26:16.157
But then we were engaged,
and then we were married,

26:16.241 --> 26:19.452
and then we were trying and she
was so upset it wasn't working.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.124
I couldn't say.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.543
I can't. My genes.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.046
"My... My genes are rotten, Leigh."

26:30.880 --> 26:31.881
So I... I...

26:34.634 --> 26:35.885
I didn't tell her.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.515
And I thought I was being kind,
I really thought that.

26:43.184 --> 26:44.853
See, we're all fucking crazy.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.647
The crazy Crains.

26:49.608 --> 26:53.194
This sickness already killed two of us,
might kill a third tonight.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.613
That's...

26:55.614 --> 26:56.698
almost half.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.243
Be almost half of us.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.875
So, you want to tell me more
about the kite and the line?

27:09.169 --> 27:10.128
Or just...

27:11.171 --> 27:13.298
Just tell me what a shitty husband I was.

27:13.965 --> 27:14.966
Go ahead.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.095
I'm so sorry.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.222
I'm just...

27:24.809 --> 27:26.061
I'm just so sorry, son.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.147
You did this?

27:29.731 --> 27:31.858
This is beautiful.
You did this by yourself?

27:32.317 --> 27:33.943
Thought it might cheer you up.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.737
Dad said you've been...

27:36.696 --> 27:38.573
What

27:38.698 --> 27:40.241
I'm... I just...

27:40.325 --> 27:42.410
I know you're taking a little vacation.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.037
I wanted to cheer you up.

27:46.081 --> 27:46.998
Oh, sweetie.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.502
How long are you going to be gone?

27:50.627 --> 27:51.836
Oh, not long.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.171
Not long, honey.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.758
I just need a little time away.
It's nothing more than that, okay?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.134
Okay.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.054
This is perfect.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.891
Thank you. Thank you! I love it.

28:12.023 --> 28:12.857
Mom?

28:20.865 --> 28:22.033
Oh, baby.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.286
Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:26.287 --> 28:29.082
This is an older picture.
He would have been wearing a suit.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.751
-About an hour ago. Did he come in?
-Yeah, I think so.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.669
Yeah?

28:32.752 --> 28:34.921
Did he say anything weird
or do anything... ?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.256
He filled up his Jeep.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.091
-Green Jeep?
-That's right.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.844
And then he filled up some cans,
like, five cans.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.138
Five cans, you say?

28:55.525 --> 28:56.818
-Was it him?
-Yeah.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.070
What are you doing?

28:59.404 --> 29:01.364
-I'm driving.
-No, this...

29:01.448 --> 29:02.574
This is my rental.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.582
Jesus, Dad, slow down.

29:10.665 --> 29:13.168
He bought five cans of gasoline.
He's not going to kill himself,

29:13.251 --> 29:15.378
-he's going to burn the house down.
-That's a relief.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.756
He's in more danger now
than he's ever been,

29:17.839 --> 29:20.216
and if he tries to burn it,
it will defend itself.

29:20.300 --> 29:23.386
-You really didn't hear a word I said.
-I did. Now you're gonna listen to me.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.222
There's a lot you don't know.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.643
I thought I could keep you kids safe
if you didn't know, but for 20 years

29:30.727 --> 29:33.313
I've been holding the door closed,
'cause I knew there were monsters

29:33.396 --> 29:35.064
on the other side,
do you understand me?

29:35.148 --> 29:36.399
Not even a little.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.861
Our family is like an unfinished meal
to that house,

29:39.944 --> 29:42.489
and your brother is walking
right back into...

29:43.990 --> 29:48.328
That house is the most dangerous place
in the world for all of us,

29:49.204 --> 29:50.747
but especially for you.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.540
-For me?
-Yeah, you.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.125
What

29:54.209 --> 29:55.877
Because I read your book,

29:55.960 --> 29:59.672
and you are the last person that
should ever step foot in that house

29:59.756 --> 30:02.258
because of what you wrote
and how you wrote it.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.011
You think you know what you saw?

30:05.261 --> 30:08.264
You think you know what you wrote

30:09.182 --> 30:10.683
I know you saw a ghost.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.353
Yeah, chapter 19.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.395
Yeah.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.440
That little story about the vanity
you painted for your mother.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.943
That's a story about a schizophrenic woman

30:20.026 --> 30:21.945
having a manic episode
in front of a mirror.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.613
You don't understand what you wrote--

30:23.696 --> 30:26.407
No, I saw Mom smash that glass

30:26.491 --> 30:28.034
-for no reason.
-Before that.

30:28.117 --> 30:29.994
Go to the beginning,
that little bit,

30:30.203 --> 30:31.996
about the vanity and why you did it.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.290
-You found the vanity in the game room.
-Uh-huh.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.584
And you walked by the man
repairing the clock,

30:36.668 --> 30:38.962
and then you saw your mother
looking into the twins' room,

30:39.045 --> 30:40.296
staring at their empty beds.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.049
Textbook dissociative episode.
She was not well.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.425
No, no, not her.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.302
The man repairing the clock.

30:47.595 --> 30:48.555
What about him?

30:49.264 --> 30:51.516
Do you know what "witness marks" are?

30:52.809 --> 30:53.852
They're scars.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.437
Little marks inside the clock,

30:56.521 --> 30:58.439
scrapes, lines, divots,

30:58.523 --> 31:00.275
from tools, gears,

31:00.650 --> 31:02.569
pieces removed from the clock.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.864
They're basically evidence of repairs
that have been done to the clock

31:05.947 --> 31:07.240
and what the clock was.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.826
And with antique clocks,

31:09.909 --> 31:11.619
you almost never have a repair record,

31:11.703 --> 31:14.205
so you have to learn how to read
the witness marks,

31:14.289 --> 31:16.291
so you can understand
what was done to the machine

31:16.374 --> 31:18.167
and how it's meant to function.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.588
Witness marks tell the story of the piece,

31:21.838 --> 31:23.464
if you know how to read them.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.133
What are you trying to say?

31:25.425 --> 31:27.802
I had that clock evaluated
by a professional

31:27.886 --> 31:29.721
before we even moved into the house.

31:30.096 --> 31:34.058
I just wanted to know its history,
know its value.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.811
That clock hadn't been touched
since the '60s.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.814
You hired a slew of workers
toward the end...

31:39.898 --> 31:41.858
Not for that clock, I didn't. Uh-uh.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.029
No, and if I had, it would have
taken a specialist.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.573
There's only a handful in the world
who know how to do it right,

31:48.656 --> 31:49.699
and they take it off-site.

31:50.199 --> 31:52.452
No. No one touched that clock.
There was no man there,

31:52.535 --> 31:56.164
and certainly not one in old overalls
with a handlebar mustache.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.082
That man wasn't there.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.460
You probably just forgot.

32:00.543 --> 32:03.046
You know, you think you're writing
about your crazy mom,

32:03.129 --> 32:05.757
your crazy brother
making scary faces in the treehouse.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.468
You see the marks,
but you don't know how to read them.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.180
I never built you kids a treehouse.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.933
What? Luke was in there all the time.

32:15.016 --> 32:18.102
-I used to go fetch him for dinner--
-We were there flipping a house.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.480
We were gonna be there maybe eight weeks.

32:20.563 --> 32:24.108
How would I even have the time to build
you kids a goddamn treehouse?

32:24.192 --> 32:26.945
-Maybe it was already there.
-There was no treehouse.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.740
Now, when we get there,
you can have a look,

32:30.823 --> 32:33.660
your mother, she was not sick.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.746
She wasn't crazy,
and neither was your sister,

32:36.829 --> 32:38.957
neither is your brother,
neither are you.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.792
Whatever you saw this week,

32:40.875 --> 32:43.795
and I'm very sorry you have to be
taking all this in right now,

32:43.878 --> 32:44.754
but you have to.

32:44.837 --> 32:46.297
Do you understand me?
You have to,

32:46.381 --> 32:49.342
because your brother's life
depends on it.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.388
That house is the most dangerous place
in the world for all of us,

32:53.680 --> 32:56.391
and that's why I told your sisters
to stay put.

32:58.434 --> 32:59.811
You really think they will?

33:05.358 --> 33:06.484
Do you think he's... ?

33:08.319 --> 33:09.195
You know...

33:10.863 --> 33:13.116
going there like Nell went there?

33:13.533 --> 33:14.909
Like going to kill himself?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.078
I don't know.

33:19.706 --> 33:20.540
No.

33:20.873 --> 33:21.958
I guess I don't.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.087
I'm not perfect, you know.

33:27.588 --> 33:28.423
I know.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.633
I'm really not.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.594
So go ahead, tell me.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.014
Try again.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.227
Dad and I were in your office,

33:41.310 --> 33:44.188
and the forever house
was on the floor,

33:44.772 --> 33:46.482
and we heard a noise under the desk--

33:46.566 --> 33:48.401
Not that. You already told me that.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.571
I was really drunk.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.782
-Swear to God, Theo--
-And the lights went out

33:55.783 --> 33:57.744
while we were down there, and I...

33:59.162 --> 34:01.622
couldn't see. I was in the dark.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.043
I mean, like I was in the dark

34:05.710 --> 34:08.171
that whole night, and I just needed...

34:08.254 --> 34:09.756
I... I needed...

34:12.175 --> 34:13.509
I couldn't see

34:14.052 --> 34:14.969
him,

34:15.178 --> 34:16.554
if that makes any sense.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.389
You know what? Never mind.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.517
-I'm trying to tell you--
-Forget I asked.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.936
You just don't know what I'm dealing with.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.313
We've all been dealing,

34:25.396 --> 34:28.316
and we somehow managed
not to try to fuck each other's spouses--

34:28.399 --> 34:30.818
Hey, that's not what this was about.
It just isn't.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.196
So, you were drunk,

34:33.279 --> 34:35.573
-and that's supposed to be okay?
-I'm telling you.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.743
I don't even know why
I let you come with me.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.789
I touched Nell's body the night before.

34:43.414 --> 34:44.832
The fuck is wrong with you?

34:46.667 --> 34:47.960
Why don't you listen?

34:48.044 --> 34:49.754
-I don't--
-I'm telling you.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.924
-I'm trying to tell you.
-I don't need to hear your excuses...

34:53.007 --> 34:54.801
-I'm not making excuses.
-...or your bullshit.

34:54.884 --> 34:55.760
I saw--

35:16.572 --> 35:17.532
Are you okay?

35:17.615 --> 35:18.741
That was her!

35:18.825 --> 35:21.744
That was her! That was her!

35:22.161 --> 35:24.038
Did you see that, Shirley?

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124
Do you fucking believe that?

35:30.378 --> 35:32.004
You ought to know why I did it.

35:33.172 --> 35:35.383
I touched Nell because I had to know.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.927
You know what I'm talking about.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.470
Don't pretend that you don't.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.640
You know what happens
when I touch people.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.725
A part of you knows, it always has.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.354
I had to know and I...

35:49.564 --> 35:50.565
I touched her.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.441
And I felt...

35:53.943 --> 35:54.861
nothing.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.072
Just nothing.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.285
And it spread,
it spread everywhere in me,

36:02.368 --> 36:05.496
this nothing, until I couldn't
feel anything anymore.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.123
I was just this dark,

36:07.623 --> 36:09.333
empty black hole.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.128
And I tried to fill it up,
I tried to fill me back up,

36:12.211 --> 36:15.423
and I called Trish and she came right away
and I felt nothing.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.467
And then I tried to mourn at the wake
and I felt nothing,

36:18.551 --> 36:21.929
and so I drank and I drank,
and nothing worked.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.140
I couldn't feel anything, Shirley.

36:24.223 --> 36:27.560
After I touched her skin,
I couldn't feel...

36:28.728 --> 36:29.896
anything.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.733
And then we're in the basement
and the lights go out.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.444
And I can't see.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.446
And I can't feel.

36:39.488 --> 36:43.659
And I'm just... I'm just floating
in this ocean of nothing,

36:43.743 --> 36:46.370
and I wonder if this is it,
if this is what death is,

36:46.454 --> 36:50.416
just out there in the darkness,
just darkness and numbness and alone,

36:50.499 --> 36:54.378
and I wondered if that's what she felt
and that's what Mom feels,

36:54.462 --> 36:58.341
and it's just numb and nothing and alone.

37:02.094 --> 37:04.847
What if that's what it is for all of us

37:05.890 --> 37:07.099
when the time comes?

37:09.810 --> 37:12.647
And then the lights came on
and there he was, and I...

37:13.231 --> 37:15.274
I didn't see him. I didn't see him.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.193
He was the light in the darkness.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.904
He was a life preserver in the ocean.

37:19.987 --> 37:23.324
I just... I reached for him
because I had to feel something.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.659
I had to feel anything.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.745
And I didn't see him.

37:28.162 --> 37:30.414
I didn't... I didn't see him.
I didn't see him.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.624
I didn't see him!

37:31.707 --> 37:33.209
And he stopped me. He stopped me.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.086
He took my hands, and he said no,

37:35.169 --> 37:37.546
and then I saw him,
and then you walked in.

37:39.006 --> 37:41.217
God, I'm so glad I did it, though.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.928
Because it worked.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.389
Oh, God, it worked.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.432
I started feeling things again,

37:48.516 --> 37:51.602
and I felt... I felt shame,
and I felt grief,

37:51.686 --> 37:53.896
and I felt... scared.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.648
I felt so fucking scared

37:55.731 --> 37:58.567
that I was gonna lose
the only sister that I had left.

38:00.611 --> 38:01.445
And I...

38:01.904 --> 38:05.408
Honestly, I had to do it,
because it felt better than nothing.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.619
That thorough fucking shame

38:08.995 --> 38:12.999
was so much better than that horrible,
empty nothing.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.751
I can't... Shirley, please.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.381
I am... I am so...

38:20.464 --> 38:22.091
I am so, so, so sorry.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.135
I'm so sorry.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.054
Please, just please.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.654
One, two, three, four,

40:06.779 --> 40:08.406
five, six, seven.

40:14.829 --> 40:15.704
One,

40:16.038 --> 40:17.832
two, three,

40:18.374 --> 40:20.042
four, five,

40:20.543 --> 40:21.377
six...

40:57.246 --> 40:58.122
Mom.
