00:01.317 --> 00:04.018
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.019 --> 00:07.989
Hey, holy moly,
guacamole, Normie. Hey, what?

00:07.990 --> 00:09.857
Huh?

00:09.891 --> 00:11.559
See that guy down there?

00:11.560 --> 00:13.078
I think that might
be Spanky McFarland

00:13.079 --> 00:14.329
from the old Little Rascals.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.263
Get out.
Yeah, I think so.

00:15.264 --> 00:16.931
Really?
Hey, I'll go ask him.

00:16.965 --> 00:18.899
I'll go check it out.

00:20.969 --> 00:22.903
(humming
The Little Rascals theme)

00:26.275 --> 00:28.042
Hey, how are you doing, Sid?

00:28.076 --> 00:30.011
Hi.
Hey, uh, my name's Cliff Clavin.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.212
Hello, Cliff.

00:31.213 --> 00:33.314
You know, I-I know
you've probably heard this

00:33.315 --> 00:34.683
a thousand times before,

00:34.684 --> 00:36.818
but you do resemble
that, uh, child actor

00:36.819 --> 00:38.487
Spanky McFarland
from The Little Rascals.

00:38.488 --> 00:40.305
Well, that's
because... 'Cause I'm one of

00:40.306 --> 00:42.173
Little Rascals fan
there ever was.

00:42.174 --> 00:44.476
I mean I've got every episode
on tape, you know.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.727
Well, except "Free Eats" and,
uh, "Captain Spanky's Showboat."

00:47.728 --> 00:48.563
That's great.

00:48.564 --> 00:50.699
Yeah, Alfalfa,
Darla, Buckwheat.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.733
(chuckles)

00:51.734 --> 00:52.767
Hey, I got to confess,

00:52.768 --> 00:55.286
I had quite a big crush
on Darla.

00:55.421 --> 00:56.755
I'll tell you, you know,

00:56.756 --> 00:58.523
if you were Spanky,
boy, I could sit here

00:58.524 --> 01:00.057
and chew on your ear for hours,

01:00.058 --> 01:03.161
you know, about the, you know,
"Happy Birthday, Mr. Hood"

01:03.195 --> 01:05.630
and the "He-Man
Women Haters Club."

01:05.631 --> 01:07.649
And remember the sound the cake
made coming out of the oven?

01:07.650 --> 01:09.851
Was it...
(makes groaning noise)

01:09.885 --> 01:11.352
Huh?

01:11.386 --> 01:12.954
So, uh, are-are you Spanky?

01:12.988 --> 01:14.088
Nope.

01:14.122 --> 01:15.523
Ah.

01:15.524 --> 01:16.558
Take care.

01:16.559 --> 01:17.892
Catch you later.

01:17.977 --> 01:20.161
You are Spanky, aren't you?

01:20.196 --> 01:22.330
Oh, yeah.

Oh, no. Who's
this guy?

02:13.732 --> 02:15.066
Huh? Oh.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.769
Well, that's, uh, Mr. Kevin
Fogerty, our city councilman.

02:18.771 --> 02:21.089
He's been there for
three consecutive terms.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.225
Running for re-election now;
Nobody dares run against him.

02:24.260 --> 02:26.661
He's also very, very rude
to, uh, voters

02:26.695 --> 02:30.932
who call with perfectly normal
and good suggestions.

02:30.934 --> 02:32.216
(camera clicks)

02:32.250 --> 02:34.285
Okay, Mr. Clavin,
remember the rules:

02:34.320 --> 02:35.950
You have to keep
at least 50 feet

02:35.954 --> 02:38.122
from Mr. Fogerty
at all times.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.341
Yeah.

02:40.342 --> 02:41.609
All right, just to be safe,

02:41.610 --> 02:43.360
I'd better go back
in the pool room.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.813
I remember Fogerty.
Hmm?

02:45.814 --> 02:48.500
He was here a couple of years
ago trying to get our votes.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.151
NORM:
Oh, yeah.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.419
He bought me a beer.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.820
Did you vote for him?

02:52.838 --> 02:54.522
He bought me a beer.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.160
Something has to be done,
and the time is now.

02:59.178 --> 03:03.331
There he goes, spouting a bunch
of meaningless platitudes.

03:03.332 --> 03:05.900
Sure enough, the people are
lapping it up like milk.

03:05.901 --> 03:09.437
Oh, the mentality of the voter
in this country fascinates me.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.573
Someday, I ought to
do a paper about it.

03:11.574 --> 03:13.575
What's-what's your problem
with Fogerty?

03:13.576 --> 03:14.742
He's not a bad guy.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.127
Oh. All
right, Sam.

03:16.128 --> 03:17.362
Why don't you ask
him a question?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.930
I'll bet you ten bucks
all he gives you

03:18.931 --> 03:20.966
is some meaningless
politician's rhetoric.

03:20.967 --> 03:21.932
Yeah, all right.

03:21.933 --> 03:23.133
Come on.

03:23.152 --> 03:24.552
You're on.

03:24.586 --> 03:26.921
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Fogerty, sir.

03:26.922 --> 03:28.889
Could I, uh, speak
to you for a second? Mm-hmm.

03:28.890 --> 03:30.524
I'm Sam Malone; I'm
the owner of the bar.

03:30.525 --> 03:32.377
And, uh, got a
question for you.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.213
I'm a small businessman, and
I was just wondering, uh,

03:35.214 --> 03:37.431
when is this economy
going to turn around?

03:37.466 --> 03:39.167
I'm glad you asked that.

03:39.201 --> 03:42.203
I say now is the time
to roll up our shirtsleeves

03:42.237 --> 03:44.005
and get to the bottom of this.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.074
The only way we're
going to defeat this thing

03:46.075 --> 03:47.708
is if we all do it together.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.078
I think you owe me ten bucks.

03:53.384 --> 03:55.233
Hi.

03:55.234 --> 03:58.069
Kevin Fogerty, City Council.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.838
Kevin Fogerty, City Council.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.107
I hope I have your vote
on election day.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.176
And why, exactly, should I
vote for you, Mr. Fogerty?

04:05.194 --> 04:07.328
Well, because I'm a hard worker.

04:07.363 --> 04:08.630
I take a stand.

04:08.664 --> 04:10.465
On what exactly?

04:10.533 --> 04:12.199
The issues of the day.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.568
Which are?

04:13.570 --> 04:17.221
The things that concern
you and your family the most.

04:22.344 --> 04:26.113
I think you're making
an ass out of yourself.

04:26.148 --> 04:27.482
I am not!

04:27.516 --> 04:30.851
I simply want the councilman
to say one concrete thing.

04:30.886 --> 04:32.320
Yes, I understand.

04:32.354 --> 04:33.588
You don't trust me.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.323
A lot of people
don't trust politicians.

04:35.324 --> 04:36.424
I know how it is.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.559
I have been out there.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.360
But what does that
have to do with...

04:39.445 --> 04:41.045
May I finish, please?

04:41.113 --> 04:44.665
Maybe we need someone to blame.

04:44.700 --> 04:48.469
Maybe if we pick some
faceless person at city hall

04:48.504 --> 04:50.805
to be responsible
for all our problems,

04:50.839 --> 04:53.775
then we won't have to accept
any responsibility at all.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.944
Well, people,
I say now is the time

04:55.978 --> 04:57.678
to start looking in the mirror.

04:57.713 --> 05:00.414
Because if this thing
is going to work,

05:00.449 --> 05:02.583
we are all going to have
to make it work...

05:02.635 --> 05:04.335
the way a bunch of people

05:04.337 --> 05:07.788
made something work
at Lexington and Concord.

05:07.823 --> 05:11.593
You may remember it;
It's called... America!

05:11.594 --> 05:12.626
Yes! Bravo!

05:12.627 --> 05:13.861
(cheering, applause)

05:16.265 --> 05:19.968
But he didn't say anything!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.738
Thank you, people,
for proving my point.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.807
The voters of Boston are sheep!

05:25.809 --> 05:27.979
Oh, I thought that was
just a Hanover thing.

05:28.130 --> 05:33.114
Look, all I'm saying is
that when it comes to voting,

05:33.115 --> 05:35.649
people just
shut off their brains.

05:35.684 --> 05:38.152
I submit we could put
a chimpanzee on the ballot

05:38.153 --> 05:39.587
and garner ten percent
of the vote.

05:39.588 --> 05:40.588
(chuckles):
Whoa.

05:40.589 --> 05:43.424
Two Hanover things in one day?

05:43.509 --> 05:46.210
You're exaggerating
a little bit, aren't you?

05:46.212 --> 05:47.262
No, no, Sam, I'm not.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.996
Look, you know what?
I'll go you one better.

05:48.997 --> 05:50.831
I'll bet we could
put Woody on the ballot

05:50.832 --> 05:52.402
and get ten percent
of the vote.

05:52.403 --> 05:54.602
Yeah, all right,
I'll take ten dollars of that.

05:54.603 --> 05:55.437
All right, you're on.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.871
You know, come to think of it,

05:56.872 --> 05:59.974
this would make a fascinating
study of voter psychology.

06:00.008 --> 06:02.811
I submit, if we just put
Woody's name on the ballot,

06:02.845 --> 06:06.047
circulate a few posters
of his attractive smiling face

06:06.081 --> 06:08.516
over some meaningless slogan,

06:08.551 --> 06:11.920
come election day, we'll get
ten percent of the vote!

06:11.921 --> 06:13.054
(people groaning) Come on, man.

06:13.055 --> 06:14.239
FRASIER:
Oh, oh, okay!

06:14.240 --> 06:15.272
I'll prove it to all of you.

06:15.273 --> 06:16.674
I'll start the process
of getting his name

06:16.675 --> 06:17.975
on the ballot
this very afternoon.

06:17.976 --> 06:19.494
WOODY:
Oh, I-I don't know, Dr. Crane.

06:19.495 --> 06:22.046
I'm not so sure I want to
get mixed up in all this.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.748
Mixed up in what, Woody?

06:23.783 --> 06:26.250
Well, Dr. Crane wants me
to run for City Council.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.352
Oh, Woody,
that's a wonderful idea.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.404
It is?

06:29.405 --> 06:31.256
I'd be so proud
if you were a politician.

06:31.257 --> 06:34.625
Uh, Kelly, I-I-I'm not gonna
get mixed up in politics.

06:34.659 --> 06:37.244
Uh, you live your
life in a fishbowl.

06:37.279 --> 06:38.612
Everybody hates you.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.948
The press is always
criticizing you.

06:40.949 --> 06:42.651
There's no way I'm running
for public office.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.085
All right, Mr. Stubborn.

06:45.086 --> 06:46.654
From now on,
you can dance naked

06:46.655 --> 06:49.957
in front of the lava lamp
all by your lonesome.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.928
Well, maybe just one term.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.953
Well, step one of my plan
is complete.

07:02.988 --> 07:06.491
Woody Boyd is now on the ballot
for City Council.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.176
I'll be damned.
How'd you do that?

07:08.177 --> 07:09.427
Well, it was really
no trouble at all.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.464
I simply stood out in front of
a supermarket with a petition.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.398
When people asked me
who I was supporting, I said,

07:14.399 --> 07:17.869
"Woody Boyd, the man who stands
for the American way."

07:17.903 --> 07:20.705
Well, the sheep couldn't sign
their names fast enough.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.861
I also put up about, uh,
300 of these guys here.

07:26.862 --> 07:28.831
300- you think that's
going to be enough?

07:28.832 --> 07:30.147
Well, there's no need
to go crazy.

07:30.148 --> 07:31.982
I only need to get ten percent
of the eligible vote.

07:31.983 --> 07:33.151
CLIFF:
Well, in that case,

07:33.152 --> 07:34.418
why don't you just put them up

07:34.419 --> 07:35.629
on Carla's headboard?

07:39.892 --> 07:41.459
Oh...

07:41.494 --> 07:45.129
Clavin, Clavin, Clavin.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.431
When are you going to learn?

07:47.466 --> 07:51.002
See, now I have to retaliate.

07:51.036 --> 07:52.470
No, you don't have to, Carla.

07:52.471 --> 07:54.706
You know, we-we could just,
uh, don't even say anything,

07:54.707 --> 07:57.074
you just forget
all about it, huh?

07:57.109 --> 07:59.243
I can't forget;
You know that.

07:59.277 --> 08:00.578
All right.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.263
Well, uh, just get it
over with fast, then, will you?

08:03.315 --> 08:04.665
(chuckles)

08:04.700 --> 08:06.033
Yeah, all right.
Thank you.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.568
No, that's for even asking.

08:07.603 --> 08:09.136
You can't hurry an artist.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.305
(laughing)

08:12.241 --> 08:13.491
Woody Boyd?

08:13.526 --> 08:14.759
Uh, right here.

08:14.777 --> 08:17.094
Holly Matheson.
Boston Herald.

08:17.095 --> 08:19.430
I understand you're
running for City Council.

08:19.431 --> 08:20.431
Yes, ma'am.

08:20.432 --> 08:22.900
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

08:22.934 --> 08:25.002
Oh, I guess that would be okay.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.170
(scoffs)

08:26.171 --> 08:28.373
Here's where your great
experiment hits the wall, pal.

08:28.374 --> 08:31.008
Well, maybe, maybe not.

08:31.042 --> 08:33.210
It's all part
of the experiment.

08:33.261 --> 08:35.529
Let's start with
our police force.

08:35.563 --> 08:37.264
Morale is at
an all-time low.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.433
Officers are
underpaid and overworked.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.900
What do you plan to do?

08:40.902 --> 08:42.903
Well, I don't know much
about big city stuff.

08:42.904 --> 08:45.573
I was raised on a farm.

08:45.575 --> 08:47.124
Oh, I get it.

08:47.158 --> 08:48.926
This is your hook.

08:48.927 --> 08:51.429
You're the innocent farm boy
telling the big city slickers

08:51.430 --> 08:54.198
to clean up the barn
and all that farm crap.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.934
Well, no, it's not crap.

08:55.968 --> 08:58.903
If you don't clean up
the barn, you get rats.

08:58.954 --> 09:01.655
Yes, yes.

09:01.690 --> 09:04.258
So in other words, it's time
to clean up city hall.

09:04.293 --> 09:08.178
Well, I'm just saying that,
uh, if you let the rats go,

09:08.213 --> 09:11.515
then, uh, you know, pretty
soon you don't have a barn.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.984
You just have kind of a...

09:14.018 --> 09:15.986
a rat place.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.658
Okay.

09:20.659 --> 09:23.428
So if we don't do something now,
we'll lose our fair city.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.196
Blah, blah, blah.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.164
You know, my
Grandpa Boyd caught

09:27.199 --> 09:29.533
a rat the size of a pig.

09:29.568 --> 09:32.804
Or was it a pig
the size of a rat?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.956
Well, either way,

09:34.990 --> 09:37.558
it was a big hit
at the county fair.

09:39.528 --> 09:41.962
So what you're saying is,

09:41.997 --> 09:44.281
there are no easy answers.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.433
Well, not for me, there aren't.

09:52.324 --> 09:54.734
You really believe
this farm stuff, don't you?

09:54.759 --> 09:56.711
With all my heart.

09:56.712 --> 09:58.579
Well, it's kind of
a cornball message,

09:58.580 --> 10:01.281
but you just might be the kind
of guy who can sell that stuff.

10:01.282 --> 10:02.349
Oh, thanks, ma'am.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.472
Woody, that was
absolutely brilliant.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.374
(scoffs):
Some reporter.

10:10.408 --> 10:12.698
She didn't even want to
ask me about politics.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.151
Oh, listen to this.

10:20.185 --> 10:22.786
"The race in District Three
is the one to watch

10:22.821 --> 10:24.872
"between incumbent
Kevin Fogerty

10:24.906 --> 10:28.459
"and his idealistic
young challenger Woody Boyd.

10:28.493 --> 10:30.961
"Even this cynical reporter
was impressed

10:30.995 --> 10:33.405
by Boyd's simple,
straightforward approach."

10:33.432 --> 10:34.799
(laughs)

10:34.833 --> 10:36.851
Well...

10:36.885 --> 10:38.519
according to the latest poll,

10:38.553 --> 10:42.507
candidate Boyd now
stands at eight percent.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.341
Now, do I need to go
for the two remaining percent,

10:44.342 --> 10:46.177
or have I proved my point?

10:46.178 --> 10:47.211
You have proved your point.

10:47.212 --> 10:48.813
You win.
(laughs)

10:48.814 --> 10:49.597
Very well.

10:49.598 --> 10:50.765
Thank you very much.

10:50.766 --> 10:52.366
Guess I can put an end
to this farce.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.934
I'll take the posters
down tomorrow.

10:53.935 --> 10:55.236
Hey, hey, turn on the news.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.638
Fogerty just got arrested
for public drunkenness.

10:57.639 --> 10:59.056
You're kidding.
(turns on TV)

10:59.057 --> 11:00.107
Good God.

11:00.108 --> 11:01.408
This will be a major scandal.

11:01.409 --> 11:03.310
You know, this could
really rock his campaign.

11:03.311 --> 11:07.014
I bet the person who's running
against him is pretty happy.

11:07.015 --> 11:08.199
REPORTER:
...Councilman Fogerty's ratings

11:08.200 --> 11:09.250
in the polls...

11:11.249 --> 11:15.072
and newcomer Boyd
appears to be poised...

11:15.073 --> 11:18.409
Yeah, I bet if we just printed
up a few more posters...

11:18.443 --> 11:21.645
Yeah, and maybe, uh, did some
door-to-door canvassing...

11:21.680 --> 11:24.715
CARLA:
Yeah, and made some personal appearances...

11:24.750 --> 11:25.883
We're going for it!

11:25.917 --> 11:27.685
(cheering)

11:27.719 --> 11:29.136
Whoo!

11:29.137 --> 11:30.170
Going for what?

11:30.171 --> 11:31.739
I missed a step.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.701
Hi. I'd like to tell you
about candidate Woody Boyd.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.868
He's challenging the status quo,

11:44.869 --> 11:46.937
and he's listening to the voters
for a change.

11:46.938 --> 11:48.739
And while I have you
on the phone,

11:48.773 --> 11:52.443
could I get two large pizzas
with everything?

11:52.494 --> 11:56.196
So, uh, you don't plan
to vote for Woody Boyd?

11:56.231 --> 11:58.799
Uh-huh. Now, according
to the phone book,

11:58.834 --> 12:01.435
your address is 151 Richmond?

12:02.671 --> 12:06.073
Do your children like
to run and play?

12:07.292 --> 12:09.927
No, it's Boyd. B-O-Y-D.

12:09.928 --> 12:11.629
Mm-hmm. Well,
he's destined for greatness.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.831
He's one of the sharpest
young political minds

12:13.832 --> 12:16.433
to come along
in quite a long time.

12:16.468 --> 12:18.636
He's absolutely brilliant.

12:18.670 --> 12:21.139
Me?

12:21.173 --> 12:22.740
Well, I am, um...

12:22.775 --> 12:24.208
I'm 26.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.011
You're not 26!

12:27.062 --> 12:29.746
If Woody can be brilliant,
I can be 26.

12:32.150 --> 12:35.419
Wow. I've never seen
all you guys work so hard.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.955
Yeah, well...
Paul, you see,

12:37.990 --> 12:41.993
most of us guys who hang
around here day in, day out,

12:42.027 --> 12:45.296
we frankly don't have much
going for ourselves, and...

12:45.298 --> 12:47.431
Woody here has a shot at...

12:47.499 --> 12:49.049
actually making the big time.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.736
It's like he...
he stands for all of us losers.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.071
Even me?

12:54.089 --> 12:55.839
Especially you, Paul.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.676
Wow.

12:59.728 --> 13:03.864
Uh, everyone, I'd, uh,
like your attention, please.

13:03.932 --> 13:05.583
As you know, it's just...

13:05.601 --> 13:08.319
48 hours until
the big election day,

13:08.353 --> 13:11.422
and I've been charting
our progress up until now,

13:11.456 --> 13:15.759
and I'd like to say
with all confidence that I'm gonna win!

13:15.793 --> 13:17.495
We're gonna win!

13:17.529 --> 13:21.098
Woody Boyd is gonna be the next city
councilman of this fair district!

13:21.133 --> 13:24.302
(cheering, whooping)

13:24.303 --> 13:26.503
Gosh, Dr. Crane...
Not now, Woody, I'm talking.

13:26.504 --> 13:28.772
Now, listen, I know
we're not in the lead,

13:28.807 --> 13:30.774
but I can smell victory!

13:30.809 --> 13:33.477
Now, I just want you all
to keep up the heat.

13:33.511 --> 13:36.247
Let's not stop until we
reach the victory party!

13:36.348 --> 13:39.733
(cheering, whooping)

13:39.768 --> 13:42.653
Well, Carla,
I see you retaliated.

13:47.142 --> 13:48.926
Yeah, it turns out, uh,

13:48.960 --> 13:52.463
she slipped me a Mickey, so
I'd fall asleep in the pool room.

13:52.497 --> 13:54.932
As it turns out,
I woke up to find

13:54.966 --> 13:58.402
that she had tied
my shoelaces together.

14:00.822 --> 14:05.075
Fortunately, I noticed it
before I took my first step.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.711
Good try, Carla.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.646
Better luck next time.

14:08.714 --> 14:12.266
Excuse me, I have
to go do my route now.

14:17.438 --> 14:18.605
Excuse me.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.741
Kevin Fogerty, City Council.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.843
I just wanted you to know

14:22.877 --> 14:25.546
that I have always
supported you people.

14:29.434 --> 14:32.019
Too little, too late, Fogerty.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.738
Woody Boyd.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.073
Hi, Mr. Fogerty.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.910
So you're the young man
everyone is talking about.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.428
Well, it's nice to finally
meet you in person.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.949
You know, you remind me
of a bright, young comer

14:44.983 --> 14:48.286
that took this town
by storm 30 years ago.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.222
His name was Kevin Fogerty.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.956
Any relation?

14:53.008 --> 14:55.141
(chuckles):
Ah!

14:55.176 --> 14:58.144
Boy, I'm looking forward
to our debate tomorrow.

14:58.146 --> 14:59.763
Debate?

14:59.798 --> 15:01.148
Of course-
on Channel Six.

15:01.149 --> 15:03.250
It's a tradition whenever
there's a challenger.

15:03.251 --> 15:05.252
I think the voters
deserve to hear

15:05.287 --> 15:07.488
our stands on
the issues, don't you?

15:07.490 --> 15:08.773
Oh, yes, of course we do.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.175
And we'll be there, sir.
Good!

15:11.276 --> 15:14.295
I'm really looking forward
to hearing your opinions.

15:16.565 --> 15:18.916
I don't know if I can handle
a debate, Dr. Crane.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.751
I'm not very good at
rendering my opinions.

15:20.752 --> 15:22.320
Nothing to worry about, Woody.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.189
Just tell some more of those farm
stories- people seem to love those.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.059
If that doesn't work, just say the
word "change" about a hundred times.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.328
Come on, let's go
to my place and work on it.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.496
Trust me, Woody, with
my brains and your smile,

15:32.497 --> 15:34.298
who knows how high we can go.

15:34.300 --> 15:37.134
Congressman, senator...

15:37.169 --> 15:38.935
(breathily):
Who knows?

15:38.971 --> 15:42.072
(band playing
"Hail to the Chief")

15:42.107 --> 15:44.842
(band continues playing)

15:44.876 --> 15:46.376
(song ends)

15:50.715 --> 15:53.583
Would you please
raise your right hand

15:53.618 --> 15:56.353
and repeat after me.

15:56.387 --> 15:59.924
I, Woodrow Tiberius Boyd,

15:59.958 --> 16:01.926
do solemnly swear...

16:01.960 --> 16:05.562
I, Woodrow Tiberius Boyd,
do solemnly swear...

16:05.596 --> 16:07.226
that I will faithfully execute

16:07.232 --> 16:10.167
the office of the President
of the United States

16:10.202 --> 16:12.837
and will, to the
best of my ability,

16:12.871 --> 16:15.339
preserve, protect and defend

16:15.373 --> 16:17.842
the Constitution of
the United States.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.477
That I will faithfully...

16:22.647 --> 16:24.014
faithfully...

16:24.049 --> 16:25.249
Execute.

16:25.283 --> 16:28.152
Execute...

16:28.186 --> 16:30.020
The.
...the...

16:30.055 --> 16:32.089
Office.
...office...

16:32.123 --> 16:33.357
Of.
...of...

16:33.391 --> 16:34.691
The.
...the...

16:34.692 --> 16:37.094
President of the
United States. Oh, I-I got that.

16:37.095 --> 16:40.430
The President
of the United States...

16:40.465 --> 16:43.000
And will, to the
best of my ability,

16:43.034 --> 16:45.202
preserve and protect and defend

16:45.237 --> 16:48.172
the Constitution of
the United States.

16:49.374 --> 16:51.976
Oh, boy.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.211
And.
...and...

16:54.246 --> 16:56.247
Will.
...will...

16:56.281 --> 16:57.614
Protect.
...protect...

16:58.767 --> 17:00.751
WOODY:
Oh, yeah?

17:00.752 --> 17:02.036
Well, I'm calling your bluff.

17:02.037 --> 17:05.638
I'm firing my missiles, too-
all of 'em!

17:05.674 --> 17:07.141
Who was that, Woody?

17:07.175 --> 17:08.541
(deep rumbling)

17:08.576 --> 17:10.077
How the hell should I know?

17:10.111 --> 17:12.945
The phone rings, I answer it.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.664
(booming explosion)

17:20.188 --> 17:22.289
(screaming)

17:31.449 --> 17:34.084
Woody! Thank God
I got to you in time!

17:34.119 --> 17:35.586
I've got to talk...

17:35.620 --> 17:37.254
What are you reading?

17:37.288 --> 17:39.490
Well, I'm boning up
on the Constitution

17:39.524 --> 17:43.327
in case I ever decide
to run for Congreff.

17:43.361 --> 17:45.395
It's Congress, Woody.

17:45.430 --> 17:49.566
In colonial times,
the S's looked like F's.

17:49.634 --> 17:50.834
Oh. Well, if I'm elected,

17:50.852 --> 17:52.903
that's the first thing
I'm gonna change.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.738
Yes. Woody, I'm sorry.

17:54.739 --> 17:56.606
There's one thing
I've got to tell you.

17:56.607 --> 17:59.197
Listen, you have got
to withdraw from the election.

17:59.277 --> 18:00.961
What do you mean, Dr. Crane?

18:00.962 --> 18:03.280
Well, aside from the nagging
feeling that your election

18:03.281 --> 18:06.567
might actually mean
the extinction of all life as we know it,

18:06.601 --> 18:09.219
you're just not a politician.

18:09.237 --> 18:11.004
Yeah, but you said
it would be easy.

18:11.005 --> 18:13.624
In fact, you said not being
a politician was my hook.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.825
I know, Woody, I'm sorry.

18:14.826 --> 18:16.677
Listen, I-I shouldn't
have led you on.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.998
I guess I was just drawn in
by the promise of power.

18:21.032 --> 18:23.083
Oh, but, Dr. Crane...

18:23.118 --> 18:25.836
No, no "but, Dr. Cranes"-
now, Woody, just listen to me.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.805
Listen, the right to vote is...

18:27.839 --> 18:30.640
it's far too sacred
to cheapen by some...

18:30.675 --> 18:32.776
some vain psychological
experiment.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.711
I mean, your
winning an election

18:34.712 --> 18:36.746
without knowing anything
at all about politics...

18:36.747 --> 18:39.850
it would just make
a mockery of the entire democratic process.

18:39.851 --> 18:42.519
Woody, you have to withdraw.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.590
Well, there's no sense in
arguing with you, Dr. Crane.

18:46.624 --> 18:50.293
I mean, next to Mr. Clavin,
you're the smartest guy I know.

18:52.913 --> 18:55.332
But what about the debate?

18:55.333 --> 18:57.418
They're expecting me
to go over there.

18:57.452 --> 18:59.386
Woody, you'll just
have to make a...

18:59.420 --> 19:02.206
a simple speech
and gracefully bow out.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.242
Oh. Well, I guess you're
right, Dr. Crane.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.511
Gotta do what I gotta do.

19:07.545 --> 19:09.313
It's too bad, though.

19:09.347 --> 19:13.183
I was really looking forward
to being a good city councilman

19:13.218 --> 19:16.270
and working hard
to make sure that...

19:16.304 --> 19:19.923
every person in my district
was ensured...

19:19.957 --> 19:22.193
life, liberty...

19:22.227 --> 19:25.462
and the purfuit of happineff.

19:28.671 --> 19:36.690
MODERATOR (on TV): Welcome to the District
Three City Council candidates debate.

19:36.691 --> 19:40.077
To my immediate right is
Councilman Kevin Fogerty.

19:40.111 --> 19:42.546
(booing, jeering)

19:42.580 --> 19:46.333
To his right is
the Challenger, Woodrow Boyd.

19:46.367 --> 19:49.303
(cheering, whistling)

19:49.337 --> 19:51.054
Before we begin the questions,

19:51.088 --> 19:53.924
each candidate will make
a brief opening statement.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.141
Mr. Boyd.

19:56.577 --> 20:00.681
Well... this is the hardest
thing I've ever had to do.

20:00.715 --> 20:05.018
As much as I've enjoyed
getting to know you all, I-I...

20:05.053 --> 20:07.988
I have to bow out of the race.

20:08.022 --> 20:10.190
(others murmuring)
SAM: What the hell's

20:10.224 --> 20:12.843
Fact is, I'm really
not much of a politician.

20:12.877 --> 20:15.879
In fact, I really don't
know much about anything.

20:15.914 --> 20:20.217
I-I... I don't know,
I just... I just wanted to...

20:20.251 --> 20:24.021
(crying): thought it'd be nice to be a...
city councilman.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.105
I mean...

20:25.123 --> 20:28.542
I'd do a good job, too,
I promise!

20:28.576 --> 20:31.111
(sniffling):
How bad could I screw up?

20:31.146 --> 20:35.715
I mean, it's not like a
councilman could declare war or anything!

20:35.750 --> 20:37.684
I-I couldn't, could I?

20:38.338 --> 20:40.237
It's just one vote!

20:40.238 --> 20:42.940
I mean, would it kill you
to vote for me?

20:42.974 --> 20:44.775
KELLY:
Oh, don't cry, Woody!

20:44.809 --> 20:48.111
Oh, well, this is...
this is my wife Kelly,

20:48.112 --> 20:50.681
and she deserves better
than just a simple bartender.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.716
Oh, it's all right.

20:52.734 --> 20:53.901
I love you, Woody.

20:53.935 --> 20:56.136
WOODY:
I love you, too, Kelly.

20:56.154 --> 20:59.289
In fact, we both love you.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.641
Both?

21:00.675 --> 21:02.025
Yes.

21:02.059 --> 21:07.314
This probably isn't the ideal
time to tell you, but...

21:07.348 --> 21:11.101
you're gonna be a daddy.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.370
WOODY:
I'm gonna be...

21:13.421 --> 21:15.405
(laughs):
I'm gonna...

21:15.406 --> 21:17.858
Did you hear that, everybody?
I'm gonna be a daddy!

21:17.859 --> 21:20.360
(laughing)

21:20.394 --> 21:22.963
I'm gonna be a daddy!

21:29.738 --> 21:33.057
TV ANNOUNCER: WATW is now projecting
a winner in District Three.

21:33.091 --> 21:37.027
Challenger Woody Boyd has
been elected to City Council.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.779
(cheering)

21:39.864 --> 21:42.182
CLIFF:
All right, way to go, Woody!

21:42.200 --> 21:45.068
I am so proud of you!

21:45.069 --> 21:47.854
Hey, hey, huh?
Good luck, all right?

21:47.855 --> 21:49.623
Don't forget that
little talk we had

21:49.624 --> 21:51.158
about extending
unemployment benefits.

21:51.159 --> 21:52.759
Consider it done,
Mr. Peterson.

21:55.396 --> 21:57.431
Oh, hey, Dr. Crane.

21:57.465 --> 21:58.565
Listen, uh...

21:58.600 --> 22:00.867
I just wanted
to thank you, you know?

22:00.901 --> 22:03.071
Uh, without you,
I couldn't have done this.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.871
In fact, you're
directly responsible.

22:04.872 --> 22:06.573
No one can prove that.

22:06.608 --> 22:09.943
I know you don't have a lot
of faith in me, Dr. Crane,

22:09.944 --> 22:11.428
but I'm gonna
prove you're wrong.

22:11.429 --> 22:13.780
I'm gonna study hard
on all the issues,

22:13.815 --> 22:16.600
and I'm gonna be
a great city councilman,

22:16.651 --> 22:19.770
and maybe this is just the first
rung on a very long ladder,

22:19.804 --> 22:21.805
and you're the man
who made it happen.

22:23.908 --> 22:26.342
(booming explosion)

22:27.305 --> 22:33.768
