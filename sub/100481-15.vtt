00:32.800 --> 00:33.633
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:33.700 --> 00:34.700
TAKING PLACE IN THIS WHITE,

00:34.766 --> 00:37.533
ANTISEPTIC ROOM FILLED WITH

00:37.600 --> 00:38.100
ONE INCREASINGLY WEAK ADULT.

00:38.166 --> 00:38.733
IT'S LIKE A HOSPITAL,

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
ONLY SADDER.

00:39.866 --> 00:41.800
IT'S BEEN A WEEK OF CONTINUED

00:41.866 --> 00:42.566
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS

00:42.633 --> 00:44.033
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHICH HAVE

00:44.100 --> 00:45.733
MANAGED TO GENERATE FAR-REACHING

00:45.800 --> 00:45.933
NO

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
EFFECTS, BOTH BIG AND SMALL.

00:47.066 --> 00:48.433
FOR INSTANCE, "COPS"

00:48.500 --> 00:49.266
WAS CANCELED AFTER 33 YEARS

00:49.333 --> 00:50.333
OF BEING THAT SHOW YOUR DAD

00:50.400 --> 00:52.633
FALLS ASLEEP TO.

00:52.700 --> 00:54.000
AND "SESAME STREET" AND CNN

00:54.066 --> 00:55.233
HELD A TOWN HALL TO EXPLAIN

00:55.300 --> 00:57.033
THE CURRENT MOMENT TO CHILDREN,

00:57.100 --> 00:58.666
WHICH DIDN'T PLEASE ALL KIDS.

00:58.733 --> 00:59.966
IN FACT, JUST WAIT FOR ONE GIANT

01:00.033 --> 01:03.133
BABY'S REACTION:

01:03.200 --> 01:05.533
>> ACROSS THE COUNTRY, PEOPLE OF

01:05.600 --> 01:08.100
COLOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE BLACK

01:08.166 --> 01:10.033
COMMUNITY, ARE BEING TREATED

01:10.100 --> 01:11.300
UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF HOW THEY

01:11.366 --> 01:13.700
LOOK.

01:13.766 --> 01:14.900
>> IT'S A CHILDREN'S SHOW.

01:14.966 --> 01:16.466
GOT THAT, BOBBY?

01:16.533 --> 01:19.800
AMERICA IS A VERY BAD PLACE AND

01:19.866 --> 01:21.233
IT'S YOUR FAULT, SO NO MATTER

01:21.300 --> 01:24.166
WHAT HAPPENS, NO MATTER WHAT

01:24.233 --> 01:24.866
THEY DO TO YOU WHEN YOU GROW UP,

01:24.933 --> 01:25.433
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.066
>> John: FIRST: OBVIOUSLY --

01:27.133 --> 01:27.833
FUCK OFF, TUCKER, YOU ONE-MAN

01:27.900 --> 01:30.433
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.066
AND SECOND: THAT UNSPECIFIED

01:32.133 --> 01:34.200
"THEY" IN "WHAT THEY DO TO YOU

01:34.266 --> 01:35.466
WHEN YOU GROW UP" IS DOING A LOT

01:35.533 --> 01:38.366
OF HEAVY LIFTING THERE.

01:38.433 --> 01:39.133
THERE'S BASICALLY TWO OPTIONS

01:39.200 --> 01:42.166
FOR WHAT IT COULD MEAN.

01:42.233 --> 01:43.066
ONE: THAT TUCKER AND HIS VIEWERS

01:43.133 --> 01:44.133
HAVE BENEFITED FROM A RACIST

01:44.200 --> 01:45.166
SYSTEM THAT RENDERS ANY

01:45.233 --> 01:46.200
SPECIFICATIONS OF WHO

01:46.266 --> 01:46.700
"THEY" ARE UNNECESSARY.

01:46.766 --> 01:47.833
OR TWO: THAT HIS SHOW IS

01:47.900 --> 01:48.366
A BADLY-WRITTEN PIECE OF

01:48.433 --> 01:48.833
GARBAGE.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.600
SO WHICH IS IT, TUCKER?

01:50.666 --> 01:51.566
ARE YOU RACIST OR

01:51.633 --> 01:53.033
A TOTAL FUCKING MORON?

01:53.100 --> 01:54.066
THE ANSWER CAN BE,

01:54.133 --> 01:56.100
AND INDEED IS, BOTH.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.500
BUT THE MOMENTUM WASN'T JUST

01:57.566 --> 01:59.533
CONFINED TO TELEVISION.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.100
THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL HAS

02:01.166 --> 02:02.566
PLEDGED TO DISMANTLE THAT CITY'S

02:02.633 --> 02:04.166
POLICE FORCE, WHILE NEW YORK

02:04.233 --> 02:05.900
LAWMAKERS VOTED TO MAKE POLICE

02:05.966 --> 02:06.900
DISCIPLINARY RECORDS PUBLIC,

02:06.966 --> 02:08.533
AND PASSED A LAW CRIMINALIZING

02:08.600 --> 02:11.233
THE USE OF CHOKEHOLDS BY POLICE.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.833
BOTH OF WHICH SEEM BOTH

02:12.900 --> 02:14.200
COMMONSENSE AND LIKE THE BARE

02:14.266 --> 02:16.133
MINIMUM, AND YET, POLICE UNION

02:16.200 --> 02:17.333
LEADERS HAVE CONTINUED TO FREAK

02:17.400 --> 02:18.700
OUT.

02:18.766 --> 02:21.600
>> STOP TREATING US LIKE ANIMALS

02:21.666 --> 02:22.966
AND THUGS AND START TREATING US

02:23.033 --> 02:25.200
WITH SOME RESPECT.

02:25.266 --> 02:26.133
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY

02:26.200 --> 02:27.633
TO SAY.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.766
WE'VE BEEN LEFT OUT OF

02:28.833 --> 02:30.733
THE CONVERSATION.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.233
WE'VE BEEN VILIFIED.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.100
IT'S DISGUSTING.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.900
IT'S DISGUSTING.

02:37.966 --> 02:39.500
>> John: YEAH YOU HAVE BEEN LEFT

02:39.566 --> 02:42.300
OUT OF THE CONVERSATION, BUT

02:42.366 --> 02:43.433
I'LL TELL YOU WHY: IT'S BECAUSE

02:43.500 --> 02:44.766
YOU'VE BEEN FUCKING TERRIBLE AT

02:44.833 --> 02:45.666
CONVERSING.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.033
IF A HIGH SCHOOL DEBATE TEAM

02:47.100 --> 02:48.633
ARGUED THEIR REBUTTALS BY TEAR

02:48.700 --> 02:49.900
GASSING THE OTHER TEAM, THEY

02:49.966 --> 02:50.666
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE INVITED

02:50.733 --> 02:52.766
BACK TO REGIONALS.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.200
MEANWHILE, SOME HAVE TAKEN

02:54.266 --> 02:55.300
DISMANTLING SYMBOLS OF

02:55.366 --> 02:56.166
WHITE SUPREMACY INTO

02:56.233 --> 02:57.666
THEIR OWN HANDS.

02:57.733 --> 02:58.566
STATUES ACROSS THE WORLD

02:58.633 --> 03:00.033
ARE BEING TORN DOWN.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.233
A SLAVE TRADER IN BRISTOL,

03:01.300 --> 03:03.200
ENGLAND, WAS HURLED INTO THE

03:03.266 --> 03:05.466
HARBOR, KING LEOPOLD II IN

03:05.533 --> 03:06.433
BELGIUM WAS SPRAY PAINTED AND

03:06.500 --> 03:08.133
ULTIMATELY REMOVED, AND STATUES

03:08.200 --> 03:10.133
OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS HAVE

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
BEEN TOPPLED, BEHEADED AND -- IN

03:11.266 --> 03:12.366
ONE CASE -- THROWN INTO A LAKE,

03:12.433 --> 03:14.466
WHERE -- AND THIS IS TRUE -- ITS

03:14.533 --> 03:15.700
LOCATION WAS QUICKLY UPDATED ON

03:15.766 --> 03:17.633
GOOGLE MAPS.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.133
BECAUSE UNLIKE

03:19.200 --> 03:20.866
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS HIMSELF,

03:20.933 --> 03:22.033
GOOGLE KNOWS HOW TO READ

03:22.100 --> 03:23.700
A FUCKING MAP.

03:23.766 --> 03:25.066
AND THESE PROTESTS HAVE GIVEN

03:25.133 --> 03:27.100
MOMENTUM TO OFFICIAL CAMPAIGNS,

03:27.166 --> 03:29.000
LIKE VIRGINIA'S EFFORT TO REMOVE

03:29.066 --> 03:30.333
A STATUE OF ROBERT E. LEE -- AN

03:30.400 --> 03:31.566
EFFORT SOME, LIKE THIS STATE

03:31.633 --> 03:35.166
SENATOR, HAVE BEEN TROUBLED BY.

03:35.233 --> 03:37.300
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT SHOVING THIS

03:37.366 --> 03:41.200
DOWN PEOPLE'S THROATS AND, AND

03:41.266 --> 03:42.700
ERASING THE HISTORY OF -- OF THE

03:42.766 --> 03:43.666
WHITE PEOPLE, AND I THINK THAT'S

03:43.733 --> 03:44.300
WRONG.

03:44.366 --> 03:47.700
>> John: WOW.

03:47.766 --> 03:48.833
I MEAN, SETTING ASIDE HER ALMOST

03:48.900 --> 03:52.333
CLINICAL ABILITY TO MISS

03:52.400 --> 03:53.300
THE POINT, YOU CANNOT "ERASE"

03:53.366 --> 03:54.366
THE HISTORY OF WHITE PEOPLE.

03:54.433 --> 03:55.000
IT'S LIKE THE SKID MARKS ON

03:55.066 --> 03:56.100
THE ASS OF YOUR FAVORITE SHORTS.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.266
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY,

03:57.333 --> 03:59.633
THAT SHIT'S NEVER COMING OUT.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.033
AND STATUES AREN'T THE ONLY

04:01.100 --> 04:02.566
TRIBUTES TO A HORRIFYING PAST

04:02.633 --> 04:04.066
NOW BEING RECONSIDERED.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.166
NASCAR BANNED THE CONFEDERATE

04:06.233 --> 04:07.100
FLAG, WHICH PROMPTED ONE

04:07.166 --> 04:09.166
PART-TIME DRIVER TO ANNOUNCE

04:09.233 --> 04:10.666
HE'S QUITTING AFTER THIS SEASON.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.566
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, THAT

04:12.633 --> 04:15.800
DRIVER HAD NEVER WON A RACE,

04:15.866 --> 04:17.766
SO YOU CAN KIND OF UNDERSTAND

04:17.833 --> 04:18.433
WHY A FLAG FOR LOSERS MIGHT BE

04:18.500 --> 04:19.166
IMPORTANT TO HIM.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.400
AND THE COUNTRY GROUP

04:20.466 --> 04:23.800
LADY ANTEBELLUM CHANGED THEIR

04:23.866 --> 04:24.700
NAME TO JUST LADY A,

04:24.766 --> 04:25.900
WHICH IS A SOLID FIX...AS LONG

04:25.966 --> 04:27.100
AS NOBODY EVER ASKS WHAT THE "A"

04:27.166 --> 04:27.966
STANDS FOR, OR POINTS OUT

04:28.033 --> 04:29.333
THAT NAME'S BEEN USED BY

04:29.400 --> 04:30.000
A BLACK BLUES SINGER FOR

04:30.066 --> 04:31.733
THE LAST 20 YEARS.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.300
AND THEN THERE WAS THIS.

04:34.366 --> 04:35.466
>> "GONE WITH THE WIND" IS

04:35.533 --> 04:37.033
GONE FROM HBO.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.500
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR

04:39.566 --> 04:41.033
FILMS OF ALL TIME, BUT IT'S ALSO

04:41.100 --> 04:42.000
BEEN CONDEMNED FOR IGNORING

04:42.066 --> 04:43.166
THE HORRORS OF SLAVERY.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.833
TODAY, WHITE HOUSE PRESS

04:44.900 --> 04:46.733
SECRETARY KAYLEIGH McENANY

04:46.800 --> 04:48.166
TORE INTO HBO, MAKING IT CLEAR

04:48.233 --> 04:49.366
SHE WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

04:49.433 --> 04:50.600
THE PRESIDENT.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.466
>> WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE

04:51.533 --> 04:54.000
HERE?

04:54.066 --> 04:55.700
I'M TOLD THAT NO LONGER CAN YOU

04:55.766 --> 04:57.700
FIND ON HBO "GONE WITH THE WIND"

04:57.766 --> 04:58.433
BECAUSE, SOMEHOW, THAT IS NOW

04:58.500 --> 05:00.366
OFFENSIVE.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.600
WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE?

05:01.666 --> 05:02.833
IS IT -- SHOULD GEORGE

05:02.900 --> 05:04.000
WASHINGTON AND THOMAS JEFFERSON

05:04.066 --> 05:05.000
AND JAMES MADISON BE ERASED FROM

05:05.066 --> 05:07.600
HISTORY?

05:07.666 --> 05:09.433
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: AS I'VE

05:09.500 --> 05:10.300
SAID BEFORE, THE ANSWER TO

05:10.366 --> 05:11.733
"WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE?"

05:11.800 --> 05:12.766
IS LITERALLY ALWAYS "SOMEWHERE."

05:12.833 --> 05:19.266
YOU DRAW IT SOMEWHERE.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.366
ALSO, HBO IS NOT PERMANENTLY

05:20.433 --> 05:22.233
PULLING THE MOVIE -- IT'S GOING

05:22.300 --> 05:23.100
BACK UP WITH ADDITIONAL

05:23.166 --> 05:23.833
CONTEXT.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.500
AND FINALLY: WHO GIVES A SHIT IF

05:24.566 --> 05:25.666
SOMETHING'S NOT ON HBO MAX?

05:25.733 --> 05:27.100
IN FACT, THERE MAY BE NO BETTER

05:27.166 --> 05:29.266
WAY TO OBLITERATE ALL EVIDENCE

05:29.333 --> 05:30.333
OF SOMETHING'S EXISTENCE THAN

05:30.400 --> 05:31.900
TO PUT IT ON HBO MAX, THE ONLY

05:31.966 --> 05:33.066
"ASH HEAP OF HISTORY" THAT COSTS

05:33.133 --> 05:35.300
$15 A MONTH.

05:35.366 --> 05:36.766
AND LOOK, OBVIOUSLY:

05:36.833 --> 05:38.466
SYMBOLIC PROGRESS IS PROGRESS.

05:38.533 --> 05:39.666
AND A LOT OF THESE CHANGES HAVE

05:39.733 --> 05:41.566
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.400
BUT THIS WEEK ALSO BROUGHT

05:43.466 --> 05:45.800
STUBBORN REMINDERS OF THE

05:45.866 --> 05:46.933
INSTITUTIONAL INERTIA THAT IS

05:47.000 --> 05:48.433
GOING TO MAKE REAL CHANGE SO

05:48.500 --> 05:50.466
DIFFICULT, LIKE JOE BIDEN

05:50.533 --> 05:52.666
STICKING BY HIS PLAN TO INVEST

05:52.733 --> 05:54.133
AN ADDITIONAL $300 MILLION INTO

05:54.200 --> 05:55.700
COMMUNITY POLICING EFFORTS --

05:55.766 --> 05:57.533
WHICH IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHATEVER

05:57.600 --> 05:58.400
THE PRECISE OPPOSITE OF

05:58.466 --> 06:00.633
"READING THE ROOM" IS.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.100
AND ALSO, WE SAW YET MORE

06:02.166 --> 06:03.300
FOOTAGE OF POLICE HANDCUFFING

06:03.366 --> 06:05.400
BLACK TEENS FOR JAYWALKING,

06:05.466 --> 06:06.466
AS WELL AS A NEWLY RELEASED

06:06.533 --> 06:08.133
VIDEO OF OKLAHOMA OFFICERS

06:08.200 --> 06:10.333
RESPONDING TO A MAN SAYING

06:10.400 --> 06:12.100
"I CAN'T BREATHE" BY SAYING

06:12.166 --> 06:12.800
"I DON'T CARE."

06:12.866 --> 06:13.933
THAT MAN, INCIDENTALLY,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.733
DERRICK SCOTT, WOULD GO ON TO

06:15.800 --> 06:16.600
DIE AT THE HOSPITAL OF A

06:16.666 --> 06:18.466
COLLAPSED LUNG.

06:18.533 --> 06:21.200
AND PERHAPS MOST INFURIATINGLY,

06:21.266 --> 06:23.333
AS PROTESTORS CONTINUED TO

06:23.400 --> 06:24.866
DEMAND JUSTICE FOR

06:24.933 --> 06:26.566
BREONNA TAYLOR, WHO WAS KILLED

06:26.633 --> 06:27.766
IN HER OWN HOME BY POLICE

06:27.833 --> 06:29.733
EXECUTING A NO-KNOCK WARRANT,

06:29.800 --> 06:30.933
THE LOUISVILLE POLICE DEPARTMENT

06:31.000 --> 06:32.400
RESPONDED WITH THIS:

06:32.466 --> 06:34.466
>> POLICE IN LOUISVILLE ARE

06:34.533 --> 06:35.666
RELEASING THE INCIDENT REPORT

06:35.733 --> 06:36.600
FROM THE NIGHT OFFICERS SHOT AND

06:36.666 --> 06:37.866
KILLED BREONNA TAYLOR.

06:37.933 --> 06:39.166
AS "THE COURIER-JOURNAL"

06:39.233 --> 06:40.233
REPORTS, IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY

06:40.300 --> 06:41.300
BLANK.

06:41.366 --> 06:43.533
THE FOUR-PAGE REPORT SAYS TAYLOR

06:43.600 --> 06:45.133
HAD NO INJURIES, EVEN THOUGH

06:45.200 --> 06:45.733
POLICE SHOT HER AT LEAST EIGHT

06:45.800 --> 06:47.033
TIMES.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.666
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

06:48.733 --> 06:50.233
THAT IS APPALLING.

06:50.300 --> 06:54.133
AND WHEN IT COMES TO ERASING

06:54.200 --> 06:54.733
HISTORY, THIS SEEMS A FUCK OF

06:54.800 --> 06:55.866
A LOT WORSE THAN LEAVING A BUNCH

06:55.933 --> 06:56.800
OF STATUES TOPPLED, CRACKED,

06:56.866 --> 06:58.233
AND BEHEADED.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.300
OR AS THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE

06:59.366 --> 07:00.166
DESCRIBED ON A LOUISVILLE POLICE

07:00.233 --> 07:02.466
REPORT: NO INJURIES.

07:02.533 --> 07:04.133
SO YES, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

AND MOVIES FOR YEARS.

DISCOVERED A CREATIVE USE FOR IT

FACIAL RECOGNITION HAS

09:54.233 --> 09:54.933
BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.466
BUT RECENTLY, AS IT'S GROWN MORE

09:56.533 --> 09:57.833
SOPHISTICATED, ITS APPLICATIONS

09:57.900 --> 09:59.033
HAVE EXPANDED GREATLY.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.400
FOR INSTANCE, IT'S NO LONGER

10:00.466 --> 10:01.433
JUST HUMANS WHO CAN BE THE

TARGETS.

10:12.766 --> 10:13.766
A NUMBER OF SYMPTOMS ARE

10:13.833 --> 10:14.900
RECOGNIZED, INCLUDING

10:14.966 --> 10:17.200
LOSER FISH.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.900
>> John: YES, "LOSER FISH,"

10:18.966 --> 10:22.833
WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS AN ACTUAL

10:22.900 --> 10:24.633
INDUSTRY TERM.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.566
THAT COMPANY SAYS

10:25.633 --> 10:26.466
IT CAN DETECT WHICH FISH ARE

10:26.533 --> 10:28.266
LOSERS BY FACIAL SCAN, WHICH IS

10:28.333 --> 10:28.533
IMPORTANT.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.266
CAN YOU TELL WHICH ONE OF THESE

10:29.333 --> 10:30.133
FISH IS A LOSER, AND WHICH ONE'S

10:30.200 --> 10:32.833
A WINNER?

10:32.900 --> 10:34.333
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.566
CAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME FISH!

10:35.633 --> 10:36.466
THIS IS WHY YOU NEED A COMPUTER!

10:36.533 --> 10:37.433
BUT THE GROWTH OF FACIAL

10:37.500 --> 10:38.400
RECOGNITION, AND WHAT IT'S

10:38.466 --> 10:39.800
CAPABLE OF, BRINGS WITH IT

10:39.866 --> 10:40.800
A HOST OF CIVIL LIBERTY AND

10:40.866 --> 10:43.066
PRIVACY ISSUES.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.433
CAUSE IF YOU WANT A SENSE OF

10:44.500 --> 10:46.066
JUST HOW TERRIFYING THIS

10:46.133 --> 10:46.600
TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IF IT

10:46.666 --> 10:48.100
BECOMES PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE,

10:48.166 --> 10:50.200
JUST WATCH AS A RUSSIAN TV

PRESENTER DEMONSTRATES AN APP

10:53.666 --> 10:53.966
CALLED FINDFACE.

10:54.033 --> 10:55.533
>> IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A

10:55.600 --> 10:56.633
CAFE WITH AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL AND

10:56.700 --> 10:57.700
YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO

10:57.766 --> 10:59.300
APPROACH HER, NO PROBLEM.

10:59.366 --> 11:00.866
ALL YOU NEED IS A SMARTPHONE AND

11:00.933 --> 11:02.633
THE APPLICATION FINDFACE.

11:02.700 --> 11:07.000
FIND NEW FRIENDS, TAKE

11:07.066 --> 11:09.866
A PICTURE, AND WAIT

11:09.933 --> 11:14.000
FOR THE RESULT.

11:14.066 --> 11:15.266
NOW YOU'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT

11:15.333 --> 11:16.800
HER PROFILE PAGE.

11:16.866 --> 11:17.866
>> John: BURN IT ALL DOWN.

11:17.933 --> 11:18.400
BURN.

11:18.466 --> 11:18.966
EVERYTHING.

11:19.033 --> 11:21.000
DOWN.

11:21.066 --> 11:22.366
I REALIZE THIS IS A SENTENCE NO

11:22.433 --> 11:23.500
ONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THAT

11:23.566 --> 11:24.900
APP EVER ONCE THOUGHT, BUT:

11:24.966 --> 11:25.700
JUST IMAGINE THAT FROM A WOMAN'S

11:25.766 --> 11:26.800
PERSPECTIVE!

11:26.866 --> 11:31.400
YOU'RE GOING ABOUT YOUR DAY

11:31.466 --> 11:32.566
WHEN SUDDENLY, YOU GET A RANDOM

11:32.633 --> 11:33.133
MESSAGE FROM A GUY YOU DON'T

11:33.200 --> 11:34.300
KNOW THAT SAYS, "HELLO, I SAW

11:34.366 --> 11:35.033
YOU IN CAFE EARLIER, AND USED

11:35.100 --> 11:35.900
FINDFACE APP TO LEARN YOUR NAME

11:35.966 --> 11:37.766
AND CONTACT INFORMATION.

11:37.833 --> 11:38.800
I'LL PICK YOU UP FROM YOUR PLACE

11:38.866 --> 11:39.600
AT 8:00.

11:39.666 --> 11:40.800
DON'T WORRY.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.233
I ALREADY KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE."

11:42.300 --> 11:44.433
BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST USERS OF

11:44.500 --> 11:45.466
FACIAL RECOGNITION IS, PERHAPS

11:45.533 --> 11:49.500
UNSURPRISINGLY, LAW ENFORCEMENT.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.233
SINCE 2011, THE FBI HAS LOGGED

11:51.300 --> 11:52.466
MORE THAN 390,000

11:52.533 --> 11:54.066
FACIAL RECOGNITION SEARCHES.

11:54.133 --> 11:54.933
AND THE DATABASES

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE PULLING FROM

11:57.066 --> 11:58.533
INCLUDE OVER 117 MILLION

11:58.600 --> 11:59.666
AMERICAN ADULTS, AND

11:59.733 --> 12:01.066
INCORPORATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

12:01.133 --> 12:02.333
DRIVERS' LICENSE PHOTOS FROM

12:02.400 --> 12:03.100
RESIDENTS OF ALL OF THESE

12:03.166 --> 12:04.400
STATES.

12:04.466 --> 12:06.333
SO ROUGHLY ONE IN TWO OF US

12:06.400 --> 12:07.733
HAVE HAD OUR PHOTOS SEARCHED

12:07.800 --> 12:09.000
THIS WAY.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.400
AND THE POLICE WILL ARGUE THIS

12:10.466 --> 12:14.533
IS ALL FOR THE BEST.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.166
IN FACT, HERE IS AN OFFICIAL

12:16.233 --> 12:16.966
WITH THE LONDON POLICE

12:17.033 --> 12:17.800
EXPLAINING WHY

12:17.866 --> 12:18.366
THEY USE IT THERE.

12:18.433 --> 12:19.300
>> HERE IN LONDON, WE'VE HAD

12:19.366 --> 12:21.400
THE LONDON BRIDGE ATTACK,

12:21.466 --> 12:22.000
THE WESTMINSTER BRIDGE ATTACK.

12:22.066 --> 12:23.366
THE SUSPECTS INVOLVED IN THAT,

12:23.433 --> 12:24.433
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GUILTY OF

12:24.500 --> 12:25.066
THOSE OFFENSES, WERE OFTEN KNOWN

12:25.133 --> 12:25.633
BY THE AUTHORITIES.

12:25.700 --> 12:26.366
HAD THEY BEEN ON SOME DATABASE,

12:26.433 --> 12:27.333
HAD THEY BEEN PICKED UP BY

12:27.400 --> 12:28.633
CAMERAS BEFOREHAND, WE MAY HAVE

12:28.700 --> 12:30.300
BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THOSE

12:30.366 --> 12:31.066
ATROCITIES AND THAT WOULD

12:31.133 --> 12:31.633
DEFINITELY BE A PRICE WORTH

12:31.700 --> 12:32.066
PAYING.

12:32.133 --> 12:33.033
>> John: OKAY, LOOK, IT'S

12:33.100 --> 12:34.166
HARD TO COME OUT AGAINST

12:34.233 --> 12:35.766
THE PREVENTION OF ATROCITIES.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.100
THIS SHOW IS -- AND ALWAYS HAS

12:37.166 --> 12:39.700
BEEN -- ANTI-ATROCITY.

12:39.766 --> 12:41.633
BUT THE KEY QUESTION THERE IS,

12:41.700 --> 12:43.033
WHAT'S THE TRADE-OFF?

12:43.100 --> 12:46.033
IF THE POLICE COULD GUARANTEE

12:46.100 --> 12:46.600
THAT THEY COULD PREVENT ALL

12:46.666 --> 12:47.200
ROBBERIES, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO

12:47.266 --> 12:48.433
DO THAT IS BY HAVING AN OFFICER

12:48.500 --> 12:49.933
STATIONED IN EVERY BATHROOM

12:50.000 --> 12:51.066
WATCHING YOU EVERY TIME YOU TAKE

12:51.133 --> 12:52.466
A SHIT, I'M NOT SURE EVERYONE

12:52.533 --> 12:54.033
WOULD AGREE THAT IT'S WORTH IT.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.366
AND THE PEOPLE WHO DO MIGHT WANT

12:55.433 --> 12:56.933
THAT FOR REASONS OTHER THAN

12:57.000 --> 12:58.433
PREVENTING CRIME.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.866
AND NOW IS ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD

12:59.933 --> 13:00.633
TIME TO BE LOOKING AT THIS

13:00.700 --> 13:01.466
ISSUE.

13:01.533 --> 13:02.933
BECAUSE THERE ARE CURRENTLY

13:03.000 --> 13:04.033
SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT

13:04.100 --> 13:05.166
FACIAL RECOGNITION IS BEING USED

13:05.233 --> 13:06.233
TO IDENTIFY BLACK LIVES MATTER

13:06.300 --> 13:10.366
PROTESTORS.

13:10.433 --> 13:11.133
AND IF THAT'S TRUE, IT WOULDN'T

13:11.200 --> 13:12.100
ACTUALLY BE THE FIRST TIME, AS

13:12.166 --> 13:13.600
THIS SENIOR SCIENTIST AT GOOGLE

13:13.666 --> 13:21.066
WILL TELL YOU.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.766
>> THERE WAS AN EXAMPLE WITH THE

13:22.833 --> 13:24.166
BALTIMORE POLICE

13:24.233 --> 13:25.733
THE FREDDIE GRAY MARCHES WHERE

13:25.800 --> 13:27.133
THEY USE FACE RECOGNITION TO

13:27.200 --> 13:28.466
IDENTIFY PROTESTERS AND THEN

13:28.533 --> 13:30.000
THEY TRY TO LINK THEM UP WITH

13:30.066 --> 13:31.366
THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES AND

13:31.433 --> 13:32.900
THEN TARGET THEM FOR ARRESTS.

13:32.966 --> 13:35.000
SO RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE

13:35.066 --> 13:36.933
ARE ACTUALLY URGING PEOPLE NOT

13:37.000 --> 13:39.500
TO PUT IMAGES OF PROTESTERS ON

13:39.566 --> 13:40.866
SOCIAL MEDIA, CAUSE THERE ARE

13:40.933 --> 13:42.400
PEOPLE OUT THERE WHOSE JOB IT IS

13:42.466 --> 13:43.333
JUST TO LOOK UP THESE PEOPLE AND

13:43.400 --> 13:44.600
TARGET THEM.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.300
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

13:46.366 --> 13:47.533
DURING THE FREDDIE GRAY

13:47.600 --> 13:49.033
PROTESTS, POLICE OFFICERS USED

13:49.100 --> 13:50.233
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

13:50.300 --> 13:51.500
TO LOOK FOR PEOPLE WITH

13:51.566 --> 13:52.866
OUTSTANDING WARRANTS AND

13:52.933 --> 13:54.333
ARREST THEM, WHICH IS A PRETTY

13:54.400 --> 13:55.600
SINISTER WAY TO UNDERMINE

13:55.666 --> 13:57.533
THE RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.800
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

13:58.866 --> 14:00.933
FACIAL RECOGNITION.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.166
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

14:02.233 --> 14:04.466
THAT EVEN AS BIG COMPANIES LIKE

14:04.533 --> 14:05.733
MICROSOFT, AMAZON, AND IBM

14:05.800 --> 14:06.900
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING IT, AND

14:06.966 --> 14:07.933
GOVERNMENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

14:08.000 --> 14:09.466
HAVE BEEN HAPPILY ROLLING IT

14:09.533 --> 14:10.733
OUT, THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MANY

14:10.800 --> 14:12.400
RULES OR A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE

14:12.466 --> 14:14.200
FOR HOW IT'S USED.

14:14.266 --> 14:15.366
IN BRITAIN, THEY'VE ACTUALLY

14:15.433 --> 14:16.900
BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH

14:16.966 --> 14:18.200
"FACIAL RECOGNITION ZONES,"

14:18.266 --> 14:19.566
EVEN PUTTING SIGNS UP ALERTING

14:19.633 --> 14:20.733
YOU TO THE FACT YOU'RE ABOUT TO

14:20.800 --> 14:22.200
ENTER ONE.

14:22.266 --> 14:23.800
WHICH SEEMS POLITE, BUT WATCH

14:23.866 --> 14:25.400
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE MAN

14:25.466 --> 14:26.466
DECIDED HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT

14:26.533 --> 14:27.666
HIS FACE SCANNED.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.266
>> THIS MAN DIDN'T WANT TO BE

14:29.333 --> 14:30.333
CAUGHT BY THE POLICE CAMERAS,

14:30.400 --> 14:31.500
SO HE COVERED HIS FACE.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.933
POLICE STOPPED HIM.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.266
THEY PHOTOGRAPHED HIM ANYWAY.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.166
AN ARGUMENT FOLLOWED.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.766
>> WHAT'S YOUR SUSPICION?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.066
>> YES.

14:39.133 --> 14:40.366
THE FACT THAT HE WALKED PAST

14:40.433 --> 14:41.000
CLEARLY MARKED

14:41.066 --> 14:41.733
"FACIAL RECOGNITION"

14:41.800 --> 14:42.633
AND HE COVERED HIS FACE.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.266
>> I WOULD DO THE SAME.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.666
>> SO I WALKED PAST LIKE THAT.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.833
IT'S A COLD DAY AS WELL.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.466
I'VE DONE THAT AND THE POLICE

14:49.533 --> 14:50.433
OFFICERS ASKED ME TO COME WITH

14:50.500 --> 14:51.666
HIM.

14:51.733 --> 15:00.800
SO I'VE GOT ME BACK UP.

15:00.866 --> 15:01.500
I SAID TO HIM, "[BLEEP] OFF"

15:01.566 --> 15:02.566
I'VE GOT NOW A 90 POUND FINE.

15:02.633 --> 15:02.966
THERE YOU GO.

15:03.033 --> 15:03.833
LOOK AT THAT.

15:03.900 --> 15:04.366
9 -- THANKS, LADS.

15:04.433 --> 15:05.033
90 POUND.

15:05.100 --> 15:05.600
WELL DONE.

15:05.666 --> 15:06.366
>> John: YEAH, THAT GUY RITCHIE

15:06.433 --> 15:07.100
CHARACTER WAS RIGHTLY MAD.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.066
AND, INCIDENTALLY, IF YOU'RE

15:08.133 --> 15:09.266
NOT BRITISH, AND YOU'RE LOOKING

15:09.333 --> 15:09.900
AT THAT MAN, THEN AT ME, AND

15:09.966 --> 15:10.533
WONDERING HOW WE BOTH CAME FROM

15:10.600 --> 15:11.966
THE SAME ISLAND, LET ME EXPLAIN:

15:12.033 --> 15:14.633
BRITISH PEOPLE COME IN TWO

15:14.700 --> 15:16.100
VARIATIONS: SO EMOTIONALLY

15:16.166 --> 15:16.666
STUNTED THEY'RE PRACTICALLY

15:16.733 --> 15:17.300
COMATOSE, AND CHEERFULLY TELLING

15:17.366 --> 15:18.900
LARGE GROUPS OF POLICEMEN TO

15:18.966 --> 15:21.866
FUCK OFF

15:21.933 --> 15:23.533
AND DO ONE IF YOU'RE GOING TO

15:23.600 --> 15:25.300
TAKE A PHOTO!

15:25.366 --> 15:25.900
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN BETWEEN.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.466
AND THE U.K. IS BY NO MEANS

15:26.533 --> 15:27.100
ALONE IN BUILDING OUT A SYSTEM.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.933
AUSTRALIA IS INVESTING HEAVILY

15:29.000 --> 15:29.700
IN A NATIONAL FACIAL BIOMETRIC

15:29.766 --> 15:31.533
SYSTEM CALLED "THE CAPABILITY"

15:31.600 --> 15:32.800
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THE NAME OF

15:32.866 --> 15:35.400
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL MOVIE.

15:35.466 --> 15:36.433
ALTHOUGH, THAT'S PERFECT IF YOU

15:36.500 --> 15:37.366
WANT PEOPLE TO NOTICE IT, THINK

15:37.433 --> 15:38.266
"HUH, THAT SEEMS INTERESTING,"

15:38.333 --> 15:39.733
AND THEN FORGET IT EVER EXISTED.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.166
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMAGINE

15:42.233 --> 15:43.366
WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD LOOK

15:43.433 --> 15:44.366
LIKE IN THE HANDS OF AN

15:44.433 --> 15:45.833
AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT,

15:45.900 --> 15:47.366
BECAUSE CHINA IS UNSURPRISINGLY

15:47.433 --> 15:50.666
EMBRACING IT IN A BIG WAY.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.300
>> WE CAN MATCH EVERY FACE WITH

15:52.366 --> 15:54.500
AN I.D. CARD AND TRACE ALL YOUR

15:54.566 --> 15:56.866
MOVEMENTS BACK ONE WEEK IN TIME.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.500
WE CAN MATCH YOUR FACE WITH YOUR

15:58.566 --> 15:59.666
CAR, MATCH YOU WITH YOUR

15:59.733 --> 16:00.766
RELATIVES AND THE PEOPLE YOU'RE

16:00.833 --> 16:01.633
IN TOUCH WITH.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.666
WITH ENOUGH CAMERAS, WE CAN KNOW

16:02.733 --> 16:05.033
WHO YOU FREQUENTLY MEET.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
>> John: THAT IS A TERRIFYING

16:06.566 --> 16:08.366
LEVEL OF SURVEILLANCE.

16:08.433 --> 16:09.966
IMAGINE THE EYE OF SAURON, BUT

16:10.033 --> 16:11.733
INSTEAD OF SCOURING MIDDLE EARTH

16:11.800 --> 16:13.266
FOR THE ONE RING, HE WAS JUST

16:13.333 --> 16:15.033
REALLY INTO KNOWING WHERE ALL OF

16:15.100 --> 16:16.033
HIS ORCS LIKE TO GO TO DINNER.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.500
AND SOME STATE-FUNDED DEVELOPERS

16:17.566 --> 16:19.833
IN CHINA SEEM WEIRDLY OBLIVIOUS

16:19.900 --> 16:21.366
TO JUST HOW SINISTER THEIR

16:21.433 --> 16:21.800
PROJECTS SOUND.

16:21.866 --> 16:22.733
>> SKYNET.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.900
WHAT IS THAT?

16:24.966 --> 16:25.933
>> "THE TERMINATOR" IS THE

16:26.000 --> 16:28.533
FAVORITE FILM OF OUR FOUNDER.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.866
SO THEY USE THE SAME NAME,

16:31.933 --> 16:33.533
BUT THEY WANT TO PUT SOMETHING

16:33.600 --> 16:35.233
GOOD INTO THIS SYSTEM.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.533
>> SO, OKAY, IN "THE TERMINATOR"

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
SKYNET IS EVIL --- RAINS DOWN

16:38.666 --> 16:40.600
DEATH FROM THE SKY.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.233
BUT IN CHINA, SKYNET IS GOOD.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.200
>> YEAH, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.333
>> John: OH, THAT'S

16:45.400 --> 16:47.433
THE DIFFERENCE, IS IT?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.666
IT'S NOT EXACTLY REASSURING

16:48.733 --> 16:50.166
THAT YOU CALLED YOUR MASSIVE,

16:50.233 --> 16:51.233
ALL-ENCOMPASSING A.I. NETWORK

16:51.300 --> 16:53.100
"SKYNET, BUT A GOOD VERSION."

16:53.166 --> 16:54.366
IT'D BE LIKE IF "THE TODAY SHOW"

16:54.433 --> 16:55.566
BUILT A ROBOT JOURNALIST AND

16:55.633 --> 16:56.900
CALLED IT "MATT LAUER, BUT

16:56.966 --> 17:01.100
GOOD."

17:01.166 --> 17:02.833
OH, YEAH, "THIS ONE'S COMPLETELY

17:02.900 --> 17:06.033
DIFFERENT!

17:06.100 --> 17:06.966
SURE, HE DOES ALSO HAVE A BUTTON

17:07.033 --> 17:07.966
UNDER HIS OFFICE DESK, BUT ALL

17:08.033 --> 17:09.033
IT DOES IS RELEASE LILAC AIR

17:09.100 --> 17:09.466
FRESHENER!

17:09.533 --> 17:10.500
THIS IS THE GOOD VERSION."

17:10.566 --> 17:11.200
THE POINT IS, THIS TECHNOLOGY

17:11.266 --> 17:12.300
RAISES TROUBLING PHILOSOPHICAL

17:12.366 --> 17:12.966
QUESTIONS ABOUT PERSONAL

17:13.033 --> 17:13.366
FREEDOM.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.200
AND RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE ALSO

17:14.266 --> 17:15.000
SOME VERY IMMEDIATE, PRACTICAL

17:15.066 --> 17:18.500
ISSUES.

17:18.566 --> 17:19.800
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEING

17:19.866 --> 17:20.633
USED, THIS TECHNOLOGY IS STILL

17:20.700 --> 17:21.866
VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.

17:21.933 --> 17:22.900
AND ITS ERROR RATE IS

17:22.966 --> 17:23.800
PARTICULARLY HIGH WHEN IT COMES

17:23.866 --> 17:24.933
TO MATCHING FACES IN REAL TIME.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.200
IN FACT, IN THE U.K., WHEN

17:27.266 --> 17:28.800
HUMAN-RIGHTS RESEARCHERS WATCHED

17:28.866 --> 17:30.333
POLICE PUT ONE SUCH SYSTEM TO

17:30.400 --> 17:31.866
THE TEST, THEY FOUND THAT ONLY

17:31.933 --> 17:33.066
8 OUT OF 42 MATCHES WERE

17:33.133 --> 17:35.766
VERIFIABLY CORRECT.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.900
AND THAT'S BEFORE WE EVEN GET

17:37.966 --> 17:39.500
INTO THE FACT THESE SYSTEMS CAN

17:39.566 --> 17:41.300
HAVE SOME WORRYING BLIND SPOTS,

17:41.366 --> 17:42.933
AS ONE M.I.T. RESEARCHER FOUND

17:43.000 --> 17:43.900
OUT WHEN TESTING OUT NUMEROUS

17:43.966 --> 17:45.633
ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING AMAZON'S

17:45.700 --> 17:46.900
OWN "REKOGNITION" SYSTEM.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.266
>> AT FIRST GLANCE, M.I.T.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.200
RESEARCHER JOY BUOLAMWINI SAYS

17:51.266 --> 17:52.766
THE OVERALL ACCURACY RATE WAS

17:52.833 --> 17:54.333
HIGH, EVEN THOUGH ALL COMPANIES

17:54.400 --> 17:55.633
BETTER DETECTED AND IDENTIFIED

17:55.700 --> 17:57.166
MEN'S FACES THAN WOMEN'S.

17:57.233 --> 17:58.300
BUT THE ERROR RATE GREW AS SHE

17:58.366 --> 18:00.933
DUG DEEPER.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.233
>> LIGHTER MALE FACES WERE THE

18:03.300 --> 18:04.900
EASIEST TO GUESS THE GENDER ON,

18:04.966 --> 18:05.733
AND DARKER FEMALE FACES WERE THE

18:05.800 --> 18:07.266
HARDEST.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.166
>> ONE SYSTEM COULDN'T EVEN

18:09.233 --> 18:10.733
DETECT IF SHE HAD A FACE AND THE

18:10.800 --> 18:12.833
OTHERS MISIDENTIFIED HER GENDER.

18:12.900 --> 18:20.366
WHITE GUY, NO PROBLEM.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.533
>> John: YEAH, "WHITE GUY,

18:21.600 --> 18:22.066
NO PROBLEM."

18:22.133 --> 18:22.833
WHICH, YES, IS THE UNOFFICIAL

18:22.900 --> 18:23.866
MOTTO OF HISTORY.

18:23.933 --> 18:24.933
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WHAT WE NEEDED

18:25.000 --> 18:25.733
WAS FOR COMPUTERS TO FIND A WAY

18:25.800 --> 18:26.833
TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM.

18:26.900 --> 18:27.866
AND IT GETS WORSE.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.000
IN ONE TEST, AMAZON'S SYSTEM

18:29.066 --> 18:30.166
EVEN FAILED ON THE FACE OF

18:30.233 --> 18:31.600
OPRAH WINFREY, SOMEONE SO

18:31.666 --> 18:33.066
RECOGNIZABLE, HER MAGAZINE ONLY

18:33.133 --> 18:34.866
HAD TO TYPE THE FIRST LETTER OF

18:34.933 --> 18:35.666
HER NAME AND YOUR BRAIN

18:35.733 --> 18:37.166
AUTO-COMPLETED THE REST.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.866
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.200
A FEDERAL STUDY OF MORE THAN

18:40.266 --> 18:41.600
100 FACIAL RECOGNITION

18:41.666 --> 18:43.400
ALGORITHMS FOUND THAT ASIAN AND

18:43.466 --> 18:45.833
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE UP

18:45.900 --> 18:47.166
TO 100 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO

18:47.233 --> 18:48.466
BE MISIDENTIFIED THAN WHITE MEN.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.900
SO THAT'S CLEARLY CONCERNING.

18:50.966 --> 18:52.866
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, SOME

18:52.933 --> 18:54.766
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE

18:54.833 --> 18:55.866
BEEN USING THESE SYSTEMS IN WAYS

18:55.933 --> 18:56.800
THEY WEREN'T EXACTLY DESIGNED TO

18:56.866 --> 18:58.833
BE USED.

18:58.900 --> 18:59.800
>> IN 2017, POLICE WERE LOOKING

18:59.866 --> 19:01.100
FOR THIS BEER THIEF.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.166
THE SURVEILLANCE IMAGE WASN'T

19:02.233 --> 19:03.966
CLEAR ENOUGH FOR

19:04.033 --> 19:05.500
FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE

19:05.566 --> 19:07.400
TO IDENTIFY HIM.

19:07.466 --> 19:09.133
SO INSTEAD, POLICE USED A

19:09.200 --> 19:10.300
PICTURE OF A LOOK-ALIKE,

19:10.366 --> 19:11.600
WHICH HAPPENED TO BE ACTOR

19:11.666 --> 19:13.400
WOODY HARRELSON.

19:13.466 --> 19:15.033
THAT PRODUCED NAMES AS SEVERAL

19:15.100 --> 19:18.166
POSSIBLE SUSPECTS AND LED TO

19:18.233 --> 19:18.433
AN ARREST.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.533
>> John: YEAH, THEY USED A PHOTO

19:19.600 --> 19:22.600
OF WOODY HARRELSON TO CATCH

19:22.666 --> 19:22.933
A BEER THIEF!

19:23.000 --> 19:24.100
AND HOW DARE YOU DRAG

19:24.166 --> 19:25.266
WOODY HARRELSON INTO THIS?

19:25.333 --> 19:26.400
THIS IS THE MAN THAT ONCE GOT

19:26.466 --> 19:27.133
DRUNK AT WIMBLEDON IN THIS

19:27.200 --> 19:28.766
MAGNIFICENT HAT, MADE THIS

19:28.833 --> 19:30.100
FACIAL EXPRESSION IN THE STANDS,

19:30.166 --> 19:30.733
AND IN DOING SO, ACCIDENTALLY

19:30.800 --> 19:31.733
MADE TENNIS INTERESTING

19:31.800 --> 19:32.700
FOR A DAY.

19:32.766 --> 19:34.166
HE DOESN'T DESERVE PRISON FOR

19:34.233 --> 19:36.566
THAT, HE DESERVES THE WIMBLEDON

19:36.633 --> 19:37.333
TROPHY!

19:37.400 --> 19:38.600
AND THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE

19:38.666 --> 19:39.366
INSTANCES WHERE INVESTIGATORS

19:39.433 --> 19:40.566
HAVE HAD SUCH CONFIDENCE

19:40.633 --> 19:41.333
IN A MATCH, THEY'VE MADE

19:41.400 --> 19:42.533
DISASTROUS MISTAKES.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.533
A FEW YEARS BACK, SRI LANKAN

19:43.600 --> 19:45.200
AUTHORITIES MISTAKENLY TARGETED

19:45.266 --> 19:47.300
THIS BROWN UNIVERSITY STUDENT

19:47.366 --> 19:48.800
AS A SUSPECT IN A HEINOUS CRIME,

19:48.866 --> 19:49.800
WHICH MADE FOR A PRETTY AWFUL

19:49.866 --> 19:52.400
FINALS WEEK.

19:52.466 --> 19:54.466
>> ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 25TH,

19:54.533 --> 19:56.366
IN THE MIDST OF FINALS SEASON,

19:56.433 --> 19:59.366
I WOKE UP IN MY DORM ROOM TO

19:59.433 --> 20:01.100
35 MISSED CALLS, ALL FRANTICALLY

20:01.166 --> 20:03.100
INFORMING ME THAT I HAD BEEN

20:03.166 --> 20:05.100
FALSELY IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF

20:05.166 --> 20:06.333
THE TERRORISTS INVOLVED IN THE

20:06.400 --> 20:08.433
RECENT EASTER ATTACKS IN MY

20:08.500 --> 20:10.133
BELOVED MOTHERLAND, SRI LANKA.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.333
>> John: THAT'S TERRIBLE.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.866
FINALS WEEK IS BAD ENOUGH,

20:13.933 --> 20:14.733
WHAT WITH STAYING UP ALL NIGHT,

20:14.800 --> 20:15.666
ALTERNATING SHOTS OF

20:15.733 --> 20:17.100
5-HOUR ENERGY AND

20:17.166 --> 20:18.366
JAVA MONSTER MEAN BEAN WHILE

20:18.433 --> 20:19.300
TRYING TO PUSH YOUR BRAIN TO

20:19.366 --> 20:20.466
REMEMBER THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

20:20.533 --> 20:21.900
BAROQUE AND ROCOCO ARCHITECTURE,

20:21.966 --> 20:23.000
WITHOUT WAKING UP TO FIND OUT

20:23.066 --> 20:24.300
YOU'VE ALSO BEEN ACCUSED OF

20:24.366 --> 20:25.000
TERRORISM BECAUSE A COMPUTER

20:25.066 --> 20:26.766
SUCKS AT FACES.

20:26.833 --> 20:28.300
NOW, ON THE ONE HAND, THESE

20:28.366 --> 20:29.166
TECHNICAL ISSUES COULD GET

20:29.233 --> 20:30.900
SMOOTHED OUT OVER TIME.

20:30.966 --> 20:33.533
BUT EVEN THIS TECHNOLOGY

20:33.600 --> 20:40.533
EVENTUALLY BECOMES PERFECT,

20:40.600 --> 20:41.866
WE SHOULD REALLY BE ASKING

20:41.933 --> 20:44.966
OURSELVES WITH HOW MUCH WE ARE

20:45.033 --> 20:45.600
COMFORTABLE WITH IT BEING USED

20:45.666 --> 20:45.933
BY POLICE,

20:46.000 --> 20:46.800
GOVERNMENTS, COMPANIES,

20:46.866 --> 20:47.733
OR INDEED ANYONE.

20:47.800 --> 20:48.800
AND WE SHOULD BE ASKING THAT

20:48.866 --> 20:50.000
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT

20:50.066 --> 20:50.666
TO CROSS A MAJOR LINE.

20:50.733 --> 20:51.633
FOR YEARS, MANY TECH COMPANIES

20:51.700 --> 20:52.600
APPROACHED FACIAL RECOGNITION

20:52.666 --> 20:53.433
WITH CAUTION -- IN FACT, IN

20:53.500 --> 20:54.166
2011, THE THEN-CHAIRMAN OF

20:54.233 --> 20:55.100
GOOGLE SAID IT WAS THE ONE

20:55.166 --> 20:56.266
TECHNOLOGY THE COMPANY HAD HELD

20:56.333 --> 20:57.300
BACK, BECAUSE IT COULD BE USED

20:57.366 --> 20:59.666
"IN A VERY BAD WAY."

20:59.733 --> 21:00.766
AND THINK ABOUT THAT -- IT WAS

21:00.833 --> 21:02.366
TOO PANDORA'S BOXY FOR

21:02.433 --> 21:04.200
SILICON VALLEY, THE WORLD'S

21:04.266 --> 21:05.333
MOST ENTHUSIASTIC PANDORA'S BOX

21:05.400 --> 21:06.933
OPENERS.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.333
AND EVEN SOME OF THE BIG

21:08.400 --> 21:10.100
COMPANIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED

21:10.166 --> 21:10.800
FACIAL RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS

21:10.866 --> 21:12.933
HAVE DESIGNED IT FOR USE ON

21:13.000 --> 21:13.900
LIMITED DATA SETS, LIKE

21:13.966 --> 21:14.733
MUG SHOTS OR DRIVERS' LICENSE

21:14.800 --> 21:16.500
PHOTOS.

21:16.566 --> 21:21.566
BUT NOW, SOMETHING IMPORTANT

21:21.633 --> 21:22.933
HAS CHANGED, AND IT IS BECAUSE

21:23.000 --> 21:24.633
OF THIS GUY, HOAN-TON THAT, AND

21:24.700 --> 21:25.400
HIS COMPANY CLEARVIEW A.I.

21:25.466 --> 21:26.000
AND I'LL LET HIM DESCRIBE WHAT

21:26.066 --> 21:26.700
IT DOES.

21:26.766 --> 21:27.900
>> QUITE SIMPLY, CLEARVIEW IS

21:27.966 --> 21:30.033
BASICALLY A SEARCH ENGINE FOR

21:30.100 --> 21:31.400
FACES.

21:31.466 --> 21:34.133
SO ANYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN

21:34.200 --> 21:35.533
UPLOAD A FACE TO THE SYSTEM AND

21:35.600 --> 21:37.600
IT FINDS ANY OTHER PUBLICLY

21:37.666 --> 21:38.733
AVAILABLE MATERIAL THAT MATCHES

21:38.800 --> 21:39.466
THAT PARTICULAR FACE.

21:39.533 --> 21:41.400
>> John: OKAY, SO THE KEY PHRASE

21:41.466 --> 21:42.166
THERE IS "PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

21:42.233 --> 21:43.700
MATERIAL."

21:43.766 --> 21:45.033
BECAUSE CLEARVIEW SAYS IT'S

21:45.100 --> 21:46.466
COLLECTED A DATABASE OF

21:46.533 --> 21:48.966
THREE BILLION IMAGES --

21:49.033 --> 21:50.000
THAT IS LARGER THAN ANY OTHER

21:50.066 --> 21:50.633
FACIAL RECOGNITION DATABASE

21:50.700 --> 21:51.366
IN THE WORLD.

21:51.433 --> 21:53.200
AND IT'S DONE THAT BY SCRAPING

21:53.266 --> 21:54.200
THEM FROM PUBLIC-FACING

21:54.266 --> 21:55.300
SOCIAL MEDIA, LIKE FACEBOOK,

21:55.366 --> 21:56.133
LINKEDIN, TWITTER, AND

21:56.200 --> 21:57.433
INSTAGRAM.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.333
SO, FOR INSTANCE, CLEARVIEW'S

21:58.400 --> 21:59.833
SYSTEM WOULD THEORETICALLY

21:59.900 --> 22:02.066
INCLUDE THIS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

22:02.133 --> 22:03.000
PHOTO OF TON-THAT AT WHAT

22:03.066 --> 22:04.533
APPEARS TO BE BURNING MAN, OR

22:04.600 --> 22:06.000
THIS ONE, OF HIM WEARING A SUIT

22:06.066 --> 22:06.633
FROM THE EXCLUSIVE "SANTA CLAUS

22:06.700 --> 22:07.400
AFTER DARK COLLECTION" AT

22:07.466 --> 22:08.700
MEN'S WEARHOUSE.

22:08.766 --> 22:11.266
AND THIS VERY REAL PHOTO OF HIM

22:11.333 --> 22:12.133
SHIRTLESS AND LIGHTING A

22:12.200 --> 22:13.100
CIGARETTE WITH BLOOD-COVERED

22:13.166 --> 22:15.066
HANDS -- WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS

22:15.133 --> 22:16.766
HIS PROFILE PHOTO ON TIDAL,

22:16.833 --> 22:18.133
BECAUSE, YES, OF COURSE HE'S

22:18.200 --> 22:19.233
ALSO A MUSICIAN.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.833
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT'S

22:20.900 --> 22:22.033
THE COVER OF AN ALBUM CALLED,

22:22.100 --> 22:22.866
"AUTOMATIC SKIP IF THIS EVER

22:22.933 --> 22:24.866
COMES UP ON A PANDORA STATION."

22:24.933 --> 22:26.733
AND TON-THAT'S WILLINGNESS TO DO

22:26.800 --> 22:30.433
WHAT OTHERS HAVE NOT BEEN

22:30.500 --> 22:31.333
WILLING TO DO -- AND THAT IS

22:31.400 --> 22:32.800
SCRAPE THE WHOLE INTERNET FOR

22:32.866 --> 22:35.800
PHOTOS -- HAS MADE HIS COMPANY

22:35.866 --> 22:37.300
A GENUINE GAME-CHANGER IN THE

22:37.366 --> 22:37.866
WORST POSSIBLE WAY.

22:37.933 --> 22:38.766
JUST WATCH AS HE IMPRESSES

22:38.833 --> 22:39.433
A JOURNALIST BY RUNNING A SAMPLE

22:39.500 --> 22:39.866
SEARCH.

22:39.933 --> 22:40.866
>> SO HERE'S THE PHOTO YOU

22:40.933 --> 22:42.166
UPLOADED OF ME.

22:42.233 --> 22:45.566
A HEADSHOT FROM CNN.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.866
SO FIRST FEW IMAGES IT'S FOUND

22:48.933 --> 22:49.600
A FEW DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THAT

22:49.666 --> 22:50.166
SAME PICTURE.

22:50.233 --> 22:54.233
BUT NOW AS WE SCROLL DOWN,

22:54.300 --> 22:55.800
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE PICTURES

22:55.866 --> 22:57.433
OF ME THAT ARE NOT FROM THAT

22:57.500 --> 22:58.366
ORIGINAL IMAGE.

22:58.433 --> 22:59.233
WHOA -- GO TO THAT -- OH, MY

22:59.300 --> 23:01.133
GOD.

23:01.200 --> 23:02.800
SO THIS PHOTOGRAPH IS FROM MY

23:02.866 --> 23:04.266
LOCAL NEWSPAPER WHERE I LIVED

23:04.333 --> 23:07.533
IN IRELAND, AND THIS PHOTO

23:07.600 --> 23:12.300
WOULD'VE BEEN TAKEN WHEN I'M 16.

23:12.366 --> 23:13.266
WOW.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.300
THAT'S CRAZY.

23:14.366 --> 23:17.966
>> John: YEAH, IT IS.

23:18.033 --> 23:21.366
ALTHOUGH, HERE IS SOME ADVICE:

23:21.433 --> 23:22.966
IF THERE IS AN EMBARRASSING

23:23.033 --> 23:24.133
PHOTO OF YOU FROM WHEN YOU WERE

23:24.200 --> 23:25.433
A TEENAGER, DON'T RUN AWAY FROM

23:25.500 --> 23:26.933
IT.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.466
MAKE IT THE CENTER OF YOUR

23:28.533 --> 23:29.500
TELEVISION SHOW'S PROMOTIONAL

23:29.566 --> 23:30.066
CAMPAIGN, AND OWN IT.

23:30.133 --> 23:31.100
USE THE FACT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS

23:31.166 --> 23:32.233
WERE A HORMONAL STALINGRAD.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.066
HARNESS THE PAIN.

23:33.133 --> 23:34.166
BUT THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE

23:34.233 --> 23:34.966
CAN TAKE YOUR PICTURE AND

23:35.033 --> 23:36.366
IMMEDIATELY FIND OUT EVERYTHING

23:36.433 --> 23:37.233
ABOUT YOU IS ALARMING ENOUGH --

23:37.300 --> 23:38.100
EVEN BEFORE YOU DISCOVER THAT

23:38.166 --> 23:39.200
OVER 600 LAW ENFORCEMENT

23:39.266 --> 23:40.066
AGENCIES HAVE BEEN USING

23:40.133 --> 23:41.266
CLEARVIEW'S SERVICE.

23:41.333 --> 23:42.366
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY IN THAT

23:42.433 --> 23:43.466
DATABASE, EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW

23:43.533 --> 23:45.833
IT -- IF A PHOTO OF YOU HAS BEEN

23:45.900 --> 23:48.433
UPLOADED TO THE INTERNET,

23:48.500 --> 23:49.166
THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE

23:49.233 --> 23:49.800
CLEARVIEW HAS IT.

23:49.866 --> 23:50.500
EVEN IF SOMEONE UPLOADED IT

23:50.566 --> 23:51.333
WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.000
EVEN IF YOU UNTAGGED YOURSELF OR

23:53.066 --> 23:53.800
LATER SET YOUR ACCOUNT TO

23:53.866 --> 23:54.833
PRIVATE.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

23:56.666 --> 23:57.766
"HOLD ON: ISN'T THIS AGAINST

23:57.833 --> 23:58.433
THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR

23:58.500 --> 23:59.533
INTERNET COMPANIES?"

23:59.600 --> 24:00.533
YOU SHOULD KNOW, CLEARVIEW

24:00.600 --> 24:01.633
ACTUALLY RECEIVED

24:01.700 --> 24:03.466
CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS FROM

24:03.533 --> 24:05.066
TWITTER, YOUTUBE, AND FACEBOOK

24:05.133 --> 24:06.066
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

24:06.133 --> 24:07.466
BUT IT HAS REFUSED TO STOP,

24:07.533 --> 24:09.000
ARGUING THAT IT HAS

24:09.066 --> 24:11.000
A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

24:11.066 --> 24:14.066
HARVEST DATA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA,

24:14.133 --> 24:15.066
WHICH IS JUST NOT AT ALL HOW

24:15.133 --> 24:15.966
THE FIRST AMENDMENT WORKS.

24:16.033 --> 24:17.433
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ARGUE YOU HAVE

24:17.500 --> 24:18.066
AN EIGHTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

24:18.133 --> 24:18.600
DRESS UP RABBITS LIKE

24:18.666 --> 24:25.233
JOHN LENNON.

24:25.300 --> 24:28.733
THAT AMENDMENT DOESN'T COVER

24:28.800 --> 24:31.500
WHAT I THINK YOU THINK IT

24:31.566 --> 24:32.033
DOES.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.066
AND YET, TON-THAT INSISTS THIS

24:33.133 --> 24:34.000
WAS ALL INEVITABLE, SO WE SHOULD

24:34.066 --> 24:34.933
ALL BE GLAD THAT HE'S THE ONE

24:35.000 --> 24:35.566
WHO DID IT.

24:35.633 --> 24:36.900
>> I THINK THE CHOICE NOW IS

24:36.966 --> 24:37.466
NOT BETWEEN, LIKE, NO

24:37.533 --> 24:40.633
FACIAL RECOGNITION AND

24:40.700 --> 24:41.666
IT'S BETWEEN,

24:41.733 --> 24:42.766
YOU KNOW, BAD FACIAL RECOGNITION

24:42.833 --> 24:45.000
AND RESPONSIBLE

24:45.066 --> 24:45.800
FACIAL RECOGNITION,

24:45.866 --> 24:46.333
AND WE WANT TO BE

24:46.400 --> 24:46.900
IN THE RESPONSIBLE CATEGORY.

24:46.966 --> 24:47.500
>> John: WELL, SURE, YOU WANT

24:47.566 --> 24:48.133
TO BE.

24:48.200 --> 24:48.800
BUT ARE YOU?

24:48.866 --> 24:49.733
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

24:49.800 --> 24:50.533
RED FLAGS HERE.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.533
FOR STARTERS, APPS HE DEVELOPED

24:51.600 --> 24:52.633
BEFORE THIS INCLUDED ONE CALLED

24:52.700 --> 24:53.766
"TRUMP HAIR," WHICH WOULD JUST

24:53.833 --> 24:54.533
ADD TRUMP'S HAIR TO A USER'S

24:54.600 --> 24:55.566
PHOTO, AND ANOTHER CALLED

24:55.633 --> 24:56.666
"VIDDYHO" THAT PHISHED ITS

24:56.733 --> 24:57.766
OWN USERS, TRICKING THEM INTO

24:57.833 --> 25:00.466
SHARING ACCESS TO THEIR GMAIL

25:00.533 --> 25:01.866
ACCOUNT AND THEN SPAMMING ALL

25:01.933 --> 25:02.700
THEIR CONTACTS.

25:02.766 --> 25:03.733
SO I'M NOT SURE I'D WANT TO

25:03.800 --> 25:04.966
TRUST MY PRIVACY TO THIS GUY.

25:05.033 --> 25:06.700
IF, HOWEVER, I WAS LOOKING FOR

25:06.766 --> 25:08.066
SOMEONE TO BUILD AN APP THAT LET

25:08.133 --> 25:09.233
ME PUT RON SWANSON'S MUSTACHE

25:09.300 --> 25:10.133
ON MY FACE AS MY CHECKING

25:10.200 --> 25:14.033
ACCOUNT WAS QUIETLY DRAINED,

25:14.100 --> 25:15.000
SURE, THEN HE'D BE THE TOP

25:15.066 --> 25:16.500
OF MY LIST.

25:16.566 --> 25:18.100
AND DESPITE CLEARVIEW'S REPEATED

25:18.166 --> 25:18.966
REASSURANCES THAT ITS PRODUCT

25:19.033 --> 25:22.800
IS INTENDED ONLY FOR

25:22.866 --> 25:23.500
LAW ENFORCEMENT -- AS IF THAT IS

25:23.566 --> 25:24.166
INHERENTLY A GOOD THING -- HE'S

25:24.233 --> 25:25.066
ALREADY PUT IT IN A LOT OF OTHER

25:25.133 --> 25:25.800
PEOPLE'S HANDS.

25:25.866 --> 25:26.966
BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO USERS

25:27.033 --> 25:29.166
LIKE THE DEA AND FBI, HE'S ALSO

25:29.233 --> 25:30.100
MADE IT AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES

25:30.166 --> 25:32.033
AT KOHL'S, WALMART, AND MACY'S,

25:32.100 --> 25:34.133
WHICH HAS ALONE COMPLETED

25:34.200 --> 25:36.466
MORE THAN 6,000 FACIAL SEARCHES.

25:36.533 --> 25:37.966
AND IT GETS WORSE, BECAUSE

25:38.033 --> 25:39.300
THEY'VE ALSO REPORTEDLY TRIED

25:39.366 --> 25:41.133
TO PITCH THEIR SERVICE TO

25:41.200 --> 25:42.900
CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE AND

25:42.966 --> 25:44.633
WHITE SUPREMACIST PAUL NEHLAN,

25:44.700 --> 25:45.900
SUGGESTING THEY COULD HELP HIM

25:45.966 --> 25:46.966
USE "UNCONVENTIONAL DATABASES"

25:47.033 --> 25:48.366
FOR "EXTREME OPPOSITION

25:48.433 --> 25:49.766
RESEARCH," WHICH IS A TERRIFYING

25:49.833 --> 25:51.500
SERIES OF WORDS TO SHARE

25:51.566 --> 25:52.433
A SENTENCE WITH

25:52.500 --> 25:56.066
"WHITE SUPREMACIST."

25:56.133 --> 25:59.233
NOW CLEARVIEW SAYS THAT OFFER

25:59.300 --> 26:00.133
WAS "UNAUTHORIZED," BUT WHEN

26:00.200 --> 26:00.833
QUESTIONED ABOUT WHO ELSE HE

26:00.900 --> 26:03.566
MIGHT BE WILLING TO WORK WITH,

26:03.633 --> 26:04.500
TON-THAT'S ANSWER HASN'T BEEN

26:04.566 --> 26:08.666
REASSURING.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.266
>> THERE'S SOME COUNTRIES I

26:09.333 --> 26:10.166
WOULD NEVER SELL TO THAT VERY

26:10.233 --> 26:10.900
ADVERSE TO THE U.S.--

26:10.966 --> 26:11.566
>> FOR EXAMPLE?

26:11.633 --> 26:12.400
>> LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA, IRAN,

26:12.466 --> 26:12.733
NORTH KOREA.

26:12.800 --> 26:13.366
SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE

26:13.433 --> 26:14.800
DEFINITELY OFF THE TABLE.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.233
>> WHAT ABOUT COUNTRIES THAT

26:16.300 --> 26:18.966
THINK THAT BEING GAY SHOULD

26:19.033 --> 26:21.933
BE ILLEGAL, IT'S A CRIME?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.566
>> SO LIKE I SAID, WE WANT TO

26:23.633 --> 26:24.700
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING

26:24.766 --> 26:25.433
CORRECTLY, MAINLY FOCUS ON

26:25.500 --> 26:26.766
THE U.S. AND CANADA.

26:26.833 --> 26:28.800
AND THE INTEREST HAS BEEN

26:28.866 --> 26:29.400
OVERWHELMING, TO BE HONEST --

26:29.466 --> 26:29.933
>> SURE.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.066
>> JUST SO MUCH INTEREST

26:34.133 --> 26:35.400
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TAKING IT

26:35.466 --> 26:36.066
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

26:36.133 --> 26:36.633
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S

26:36.700 --> 26:37.500
NOT TERRIBLY COMFORTING!

26:37.566 --> 26:38.600
WHEN YOU ASK A FARMER IF

26:38.666 --> 26:39.533
HE WOULD LET FOXES IN THE

26:39.600 --> 26:40.366
HEN HOUSE, THE ANSWER YOU HOPE

26:40.433 --> 26:41.500
FOR IS "NO," NOT:

26:41.566 --> 26:42.500
"THE INTEREST FROM THE FOXES HAS

26:42.566 --> 26:43.766
BEEN OVERWHELMING, TO BE HONEST,

26:43.833 --> 26:44.733
JUST SO MUCH INTEREST, SO YOU

26:44.800 --> 26:45.433
KNOW, WE'RE TAKING IT ONE DAY AT

26:45.500 --> 26:47.833
A TIME."

26:47.900 --> 26:49.566
AND UNSURPRISINGLY, REPORTERS

26:49.633 --> 26:50.733
FOR BUZZFEED HAVE FOUND

26:50.800 --> 26:51.433
CLEARVIEW HAS QUIETLY OFFERED

26:51.500 --> 26:52.800
ITS SERVICES TO ENTITIES IN

26:52.866 --> 26:54.700
SAUDI ARABIA AND

26:54.766 --> 26:55.766
THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES --

26:55.833 --> 26:57.300
COUNTRIES THAT VIEW HUMAN RIGHTS

26:57.366 --> 26:58.966
LAWS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF

26:59.033 --> 27:00.366
RESPECT THAT CLEARVIEW HAS FOR

27:00.433 --> 27:01.100
FACEBOOK'S TERMS OF SERVICE.

27:01.166 --> 27:02.066
SO FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

27:02.133 --> 27:03.533
IS ALREADY HERE.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.766
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT CAN WE DO

27:04.833 --> 27:06.133
ABOUT IT?

27:06.200 --> 27:08.066
WELL, SOME ARE TRYING TO FIND

27:08.133 --> 27:09.300
WAYS TO THWART THE CAMERAS

27:09.366 --> 27:10.700
THEMSELVES.

27:10.766 --> 27:12.066
>> HI, GUYS.

27:12.133 --> 27:12.900
IT'S ME JILLIAN, AGAIN, WITH

27:12.966 --> 27:13.466
A NEW MAKEUP TUTORIAL.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.200
TODAY'S TOPIC IS HOW TO HIDE

27:15.266 --> 27:17.600
FROM CAMERAS.

27:17.666 --> 27:18.500
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT'S

27:18.566 --> 27:19.733
PROBABLY NOT A SCALABLE

27:19.800 --> 27:22.566
SOLUTION.

27:22.633 --> 27:23.233
AND SECOND, I'M NOT SURE IF THAT

27:23.300 --> 27:24.400
MAKES YOU LESS IDENTIFIABLE,

27:24.466 --> 27:25.400
OR THE MOST IDENTIFIABLE PERSON

27:25.466 --> 27:27.133
ON EARTH.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.200
"OFFICERS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A

27:28.266 --> 27:29.333
YOUNG WOMAN -- DARK HAIR, MEDIUM

27:29.400 --> 27:30.266
BUILD, LOOKS LIKE A MIME WHO

27:30.333 --> 27:33.066
WENT THROUGH A SHREDDER."

27:33.133 --> 27:38.000
LOOK, CLEARLY, WHAT WE REALLY

27:38.066 --> 27:39.566
NEED TO DO IS IS PUT LIMITS ON

27:39.633 --> 27:40.400
HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED.

27:40.466 --> 27:41.400
AND SOME LOCATIONS HAVE LAWS

27:41.466 --> 27:42.633
IN PLACE ALREADY: SAN FRANCISCO

27:42.700 --> 27:43.233
BANNED FACIAL RECOGNITION LAST

27:43.300 --> 27:44.166
YEAR, BUT THE SCOPE OF THAT IS

27:44.233 --> 27:45.866
LIMITED TO CITY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

27:45.933 --> 27:47.033
IT DOESN'T AFFECT STATE AND

27:47.100 --> 27:47.833
FEDERAL USE, OR PRIVATE

27:47.900 --> 27:49.200
COMPANIES.

27:49.266 --> 27:50.700
MEANWHILE, ILLINOIS HAS A LAW

27:50.766 --> 27:52.166
REQUIRING COMPANIES TO OBTAIN

27:52.233 --> 27:53.800
WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE

27:53.866 --> 27:54.566
COLLECTING A PERSON'S

27:54.633 --> 27:56.166
FINGERPRINTS, FACIAL SCANS, OR

27:56.233 --> 27:57.233
OTHER IDENTIFYING BIOLOGICAL

27:57.300 --> 27:58.266
CHARACTERISTICS.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.733
AND THAT IS GOOD.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.733
BUT WE ALSO NEED A

28:01.800 --> 28:03.266
COMPREHENSIVE, NATION-WIDE

28:03.333 --> 28:04.300
POLICY.

28:04.366 --> 28:07.233
AND WE NEED IT RIGHT NOW.

28:07.300 --> 28:07.866
BECAUSE, AGAIN, THERE ARE

28:07.933 --> 28:10.800
WORRIES THAT IT'S BEING USED

28:10.866 --> 28:12.333
IN THE PROTESTS THAT WE'RE

28:12.400 --> 28:13.433
SEEING NOW.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.433
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, JUST THIS

28:14.500 --> 28:15.100
WEEK -- THANKS TO THOSE PROTESTS

28:15.166 --> 28:16.533
AND YEARS OF WORK BY ACTIVISTS

28:16.600 --> 28:17.300
-- SOME COMPANIES DID PULL BACK

28:17.366 --> 28:18.500
FROM FACIAL RECOGNITION.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.433
FOR INSTANCE, IBM SAYS THEY'LL

28:20.500 --> 28:21.600
NO LONGER DEVELOP FACIAL

28:21.666 --> 28:22.700
RECOGNITION.

28:22.766 --> 28:24.066
MEANWHILE, AMAZON SAID IT WAS

28:24.133 --> 28:25.933
PUTTING A ONE-YEAR HOLD ON

28:26.000 --> 28:27.566
WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

28:27.633 --> 28:28.766
AND MICROSOFT SAID IT WOULDN'T

28:28.833 --> 28:30.133
SELL ITS TECHNOLOGY TO POLICE

28:30.200 --> 28:34.500
WITHOUT FEDERAL REGULATION.

28:34.566 --> 28:35.400
BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO STOP

28:35.466 --> 28:36.100
THOSE COMPANIES FROM CHANGING

28:36.166 --> 28:37.300
THEIR MIND IF PEOPLE'S OUTRAGE

28:37.366 --> 28:38.233
DIES DOWN.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.833
AND FOR THE RECORD, WHILE

28:39.900 --> 28:40.933
CLEARVIEW SAYS IT'S CANCELING

28:41.000 --> 28:42.500
ITS PRIVATE CONTRACTS, IT'S ALSO

28:42.566 --> 28:43.866
SAID IT WILL KEEP WORKING WITH

28:43.933 --> 28:45.800
THE POLICE, JUST AS IT WILL KEEP

28:45.866 --> 28:48.066
HARVESTING PHOTOS FROM THE

28:48.133 --> 28:50.233
INTERNET.

28:50.300 --> 28:51.766
SO IF CLEARVIEW IS GOING TO KEEP

28:51.833 --> 28:52.933
GRABBING OUR PHOTOS, AT THE VERY

28:53.000 --> 28:54.033
LEAST, THERE MAY BE A WAY TO LET

28:54.100 --> 28:54.666
THEM KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT

28:54.733 --> 28:55.866
THAT.

28:55.933 --> 28:57.266
SO THE NEXT TIME YOU FEEL THE

28:57.333 --> 28:59.100
NEED TO UPLOAD A PHOTO MAYBE

28:59.166 --> 29:00.466
THROW IN AN EXTRA ONE FOR THEM

29:00.533 --> 29:01.800
TO COLLECT.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.400
MAYBE HOLD UP A SIGN THAT SAYS,

29:03.466 --> 29:04.300
"THESE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN

29:04.366 --> 29:05.200
UNWILLINGLY AND I'D RATHER

29:05.266 --> 29:06.466
YOU NOT BE LOOKING AT THEM."

29:06.533 --> 29:07.633
OR, IF THAT FEELS TOO

29:07.700 --> 29:09.000
COMPLICATED, JUST

29:09.066 --> 29:14.233
"FUCK CLEARVIEW."

29:14.300 --> 29:15.000
THAT REALLY DOES GET THE MESSAGE

29:15.066 --> 29:15.233
ACROSS.

29:15.300 --> 29:15.933
AND REMEMBER, THESE PHOTOS ARE

29:16.000 --> 29:19.200
OFTEN BEING SEARCHED BY

29:19.266 --> 29:20.233
LAW ENFORCEMENT, SO YOU MAY

29:20.300 --> 29:21.166
WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

29:21.233 --> 29:22.000
TO TALK TO THE INVESTIGATORS

29:22.066 --> 29:22.833
LOOKING THROUGH YOUR PHOTOS.

29:22.900 --> 29:23.633
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE, I DON'T

29:23.700 --> 29:24.433
LOOK LIKE WOODY HARRELSON, BUT

29:24.500 --> 29:25.033
WHILE I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,

29:25.100 --> 29:26.400
DEFUND THE POLICE.

29:26.466 --> 29:27.833
REALLY, WHATEVER YOU FEEL IS

29:27.900 --> 29:29.366
MOST IMPORTANT TO TELL THEM,

29:29.433 --> 29:30.366
YOU SHOULD PUT ON A SIGN.

29:30.433 --> 29:31.466
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:31.533 --> 29:35.033
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.633
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
