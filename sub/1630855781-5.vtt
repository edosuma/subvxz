Guys, eggs are chicken period,
aren't they?

01:49.720 --> 01:52.679
Morning.
I'm taking Elsie to school.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.280
Are you guys going to college?
It's been three days.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.559
So unless your parents tell me it's okay,
I think you need to go.

01:58.559 --> 02:00.919
Yeah, my mum's been asking,
but rock 'n' roll.

02:00.919 --> 02:04.160
- I don't care. I'm not scared.
- I can take another day. It'll be fine.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.199
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

02:05.199 --> 02:07.479
I'm gonna go to the funeral home
with Sean today,

02:07.479 --> 02:09.680
so you two should go back to college.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.440
Okay, I am actually really scared.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.440
- I'll go get ready.
- Okay.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.360
Thanks for brekkie.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.560
Do you wanna do something later?

02:25.720 --> 02:27.560
Like, go out. You and me.

02:29.640 --> 02:30.720
Okay, just to clarify,

02:30.720 --> 02:34.519
because I've got this wrong in the past...
do you mean a date?

02:35.760 --> 02:37.160
Yeah, I mean a date.

02:39.519 --> 02:40.560
Are you sure?

02:41.080 --> 02:43.239
Just with what's goin' on at the moment?

02:44.519 --> 02:45.519
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:45.519 --> 02:48.360
I think it would really help
to take my mind off things.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.400
- You know?
- Yeah. No. Let's... let's go on a date.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.360
It'll be fun.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.840
Okay, great. Yes. Yeah.

03:09.040 --> 03:14.160
Thanks for letting me walk you to college.
Oh, and, um... good luck with the test.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.519
Walkin' to college together already?

03:23.519 --> 03:26.519
- It's gettin' serious!
- Shut up.

03:26.519 --> 03:27.679
- But I know, right?
- Mmm!

03:27.679 --> 03:29.880
- He's taking me to Martha Street Cinema.
- Oh!

03:29.880 --> 03:32.200
They're playing
all the old movies this week.

03:35.679 --> 03:38.320
How are you feeling?
I was worried about you.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.679
Oh, I'm okay. Been trying not to think
about it too much, to be honest.

03:41.679 --> 03:45.079
And I've decided, yeah?
I wanna find my sperm donor.

03:45.079 --> 03:48.040
- So grim. I heard that about him.
- I know. Everyone...

03:48.040 --> 03:50.760
Um... wow! That's kind of a big deal.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.000
Well, yeah.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.959
My parents don't talk about donor stuff,
you know, like, ever.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.280
They made me this book when I was a kid.
That was the end of the conversation.

03:59.799 --> 04:03.119
But I wanna know, you know,
like... where I come from.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.880
Are you gonna try and tell your parents
that you're doing this?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.480
Yeah, I will at some point.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.519
Jackson, you have to tell them.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.119
Yeah, I will.

04:12.839 --> 04:15.720
So, I have had an idea,

04:16.320 --> 04:18.360
and you can totally say no.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.320
Try me.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.880
Okay, well, you know the other day
at the soup kitchen?

04:22.880 --> 04:25.080
- Yeah.
- I wasn't supposed to go, obviously.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.880
But I feel like I was led there.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.360
- And this is silly. This is silly. This...
- No, don't worry. I do get it. Go on.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.599
Okay, well, I then found out
that its funding has been cut,

04:36.599 --> 04:41.200
and it just all felt like
it was supposed to be or something.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.320
And I was wondering whether
we could use the fundraiser for that.

04:46.479 --> 04:49.200
- Roman might take a bit of persuading.
- Yeah.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.680
But queer people holding out
an olive branch to the church?

04:51.680 --> 04:53.640
I feel it's givin' "We are gay Jesus."

04:53.640 --> 04:56.200
- We are... We totally are gay Jesus.
- We're gay Jesus.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.720
- In the name of the Father, the Son...
- Girl!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.120
- Ah!
- No, I love it. Let's do it.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.720
- Yeah? Oh my God. Oh!
- Yeah. 100%. That'll be so good for us.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.520
Thank you, Abbi. Thank you.
I feel like it'll mean so much to my mum...

05:09.680 --> 05:12.320
I'll leave you guys to catch up.
I'll see you in a bit.

05:15.360 --> 05:16.280
Okay.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.400
Yeah, it was so funny...

05:20.000 --> 05:21.200
Hey, Otis.

05:21.720 --> 05:22.800
Um, hey.

05:24.320 --> 05:28.599
I have been wanting to say sorry
about the club night

05:28.599 --> 05:31.720
because it was awkward and not nice,
and I feel terrible.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.280
- Yeah... It's fine.
- And it was awk--

05:33.280 --> 05:35.080
It's fine. Honestly. Like...

05:35.080 --> 05:38.880
It probably wasn't even my thing.
But I need to tell you something.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.720
It happened that night, and I'm feeling
really weird about it. Basically...

05:43.479 --> 05:45.359
me and Ruby fell asleep together.

05:45.359 --> 05:46.320
Nothing happened.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.680
But we were hangin' out all night,
and we woke up in the same bed.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.680
Oh... gosh.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.599
Yeah.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.440
- Have you told Maeve?
- Mm, no.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.479
We weren't really speaking
when it happened.

05:58.479 --> 06:01.840
And... I know it didn't mean anything,
but I need to tell her.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.440
But her fuckin' mum's just died.
So, I don't know.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.240
- It's, like, the wrong... time.
- Mmm... mmm...

06:07.240 --> 06:12.320
Well, the longer you leave that,
the more of a secret it's gonna feel.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.680
- Yep.
- Yeah.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.400
How was the club?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.520
Oh-ho!

06:18.520 --> 06:22.120
It was amazing!
I got with the hottest guy ever.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.080
- From my church.
- She was on it one time!

06:24.080 --> 06:27.280
Oh! Otis! You're back!

06:27.280 --> 06:29.120
I was worried I'd have no one to debate.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.680
I loved chattin' to your mum, by the way.
She told me so much about you.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.160
I forgot about the debate.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.640
Oh shit.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.320
Okay, um... I gotta go.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.320
Nice chattin'.

06:49.039 --> 06:51.440
That was a nice chat about my life.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.640
Ruby, hey.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.240
So, O is calling herself
the "Star of <i>Sexology,</i>" which is a lie.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.400
- Is that even allowed?
- No, it's called "spin," Otis.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.479
So, I haven't... really had any time
to prepare anything for the debate.

07:06.479 --> 07:08.640
You don't have any notes for me, do you?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.560
No. Why would I have that?

07:11.280 --> 07:13.200
Because you're my campaign manager.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.760
I <i>was</i> your campaign manager.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.719
Then you stopped responding to my texts
and disappeared for three days.

07:19.719 --> 07:21.120
So you're on your own.

07:22.479 --> 07:24.880
Uh, you're right, and I should've...
I'm sorry.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.000
Wait, please. I should have texted you.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.200
It's just Maeve's mum just died,
and I've been a bit all over the place.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.080
And I'm rubbish
at this whole election thing without you.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.760
Please?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.640
I'm sorry about Maeve's mum.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.680
Thanks.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.680
Okay. You don't have
a lot of time to prepare.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.120
You want to deliver your mission statement
in a concise way. Don't ramble.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.239
- I don't ramble.
- You do. You ramble, Otis.

07:50.239 --> 07:52.440
<i>Sexology!</i>

07:52.440 --> 07:54.479
- <i>Sexology!</i>
- Did you get any dirt on her?

07:54.479 --> 07:59.080
No, everyone at this college is so sweet
and good-natured. It's disgusting, really.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.880
I'll find you later.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.359
- Vote O!
- Ruby.

08:07.159 --> 08:08.200
Oh, that is good.

08:08.799 --> 08:10.960
We have some information for you.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.039
- It's about O.
- Oh?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.239
Work, you big metal fuck!

08:16.239 --> 08:18.760
It's broken again, mate.
I've called an engineer.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.599
Great. When are they getting here?

08:20.599 --> 08:23.560
Tomorrow, hopefully,
but it took three days last time.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.880
So, how am I supposed to get
to my class now, then?

08:28.400 --> 08:29.919
I'm not sure.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.439
That's a tricky one.
Maybe I could carry you.

08:33.439 --> 08:35.400
Could you? Really?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.840
Me, my chair, up two flights of stairs.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.079
I've broken my neck once.
I'd rather not do it again, but thank you.

08:41.079 --> 08:44.199
I could set up a classroom
down here for you.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.520
Yeah.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.079
Ah-ah-ah.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.880
Can I take Isaac's stuff down to him?
He says the lift's broken again.

09:00.880 --> 09:01.840
Yeah, of course.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.640
This fucking college.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.400
- Hey, there.
- Hiya.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.120
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.640
- How's Maeve doing?
- Oh my God. I'm so worried about her.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.959
- It's awful.
- Yeah.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.680
Her mum was complicated, but...

09:22.680 --> 09:23.800
Yeah, I really liked her.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.520
Hey, how are your photos going?

09:28.520 --> 09:30.440
- Good, I think.
- Yeah?

09:30.440 --> 09:31.600
- Yeah!
- Good.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.440
- How do I get them out of this?
- Ah. We need to use a darkroom.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.120
Which, luckily for you,
is on the ground floor.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.720
- What do you think?
- They're hideous.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.839
Right.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.520
Which means Mum would have liked them.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.800
How much do you think they cost?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.160
Sean?

09:56.720 --> 09:59.160
- Boo!
- Fuck's sake. That's not funny.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.360
You've gotta try it before you buy it.
This one's good. Very comfy.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.720
Grow up.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.720
I'm very sorry for your loss.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.199
Thank you. Sean, get out of the box.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.600
- Hi. Nice to meet you, mate.
- So, how can I help?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.440
We've never done this before.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.199
Um... ahem. How does it work?

10:22.199 --> 10:24.400
Did your mother leave behind
any instructions?

10:24.400 --> 10:27.320
No, she wasn't much of a planner.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.640
Do you know if she wanted
a burial or a cremation?

10:29.640 --> 10:31.480
- Burial.
- Cremation. Cremation.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.680
She told me she didn't want
her exes visiting her grave.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.400
Don't like the idea of her gettin' burned.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.959
I don't like the idea of her being stuck
underground. She was claustrophobic.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.920
- You can think about it. Please.
- All right.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.400
So, how many people will you be expecting?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.240
Absolutely no one.
Mum didn't have friends.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.800
- People didn't like her.
- That's not really true. She had friends.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.440
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.040
- Name one friend.
- Sh... um...

10:56.320 --> 10:57.240
Uh...

10:57.240 --> 10:59.400
Exactly. Anyway, it's good news for us.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.719
It doesn't matter if it's a shit funeral
if no one's there.

11:01.719 --> 11:03.120
Fuck's sake, Sean.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.560
An intimate funeral, then.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.959
Yeah, an intimate funeral.
God, you're a good salesman.

11:07.959 --> 11:12.079
I'll give you a moment alone to discuss,
but here are all our packages.

11:12.079 --> 11:13.800
- Right.
- Thank you.

11:17.839 --> 11:19.360
Fuckin' hell.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.440
Well, I guess it's a cremation,
then, isn't it?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.440
Right.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.680
I have to take this. Sorry.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.719
- Sean.
- Two seconds. Two seconds.

11:32.719 --> 11:34.719
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, mate.

11:41.959 --> 11:45.040
She cries a lot.
I find it hard to settle her.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.160
And... and she makes these grunting sounds
after she's feeding.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.199
And she does these
unbelievable projectile poos.

11:53.199 --> 11:55.839
I was wondering if it had to do
with her being premature.

11:55.839 --> 11:57.360
No, I don't think so.

11:57.360 --> 12:01.320
Joy is a very healthy baby. Yeah.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.120
- Really?
- There we are.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.320
Such a relief.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.040
I didn't realize
how anxious I was about today.

12:08.719 --> 12:09.839
And how is Mum's mood?

12:09.839 --> 12:13.160
Oh, I'm fine. Just... I'm a bit tired.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.280
Your mood is not okay.
She cries all of the time.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.800
She's stressed and forgetful
and touchy as fuck.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.560
You're not right. Sorry.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.920
Can I speak to Jean alone for a moment?

12:23.920 --> 12:26.520
- Oh, I'm her sister. It's fine.
- Jo!

12:28.079 --> 12:29.199
Fine.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.959
Okay.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.880
A bit of blueness is normal after a baby.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.480
But feeling constantly anxious
and low isn't.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.640
I can see from your notes that you've had
a previous period of depression.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.199
Yes. Well, that was ten years ago.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.240
I mention this because birthing parents

12:47.240 --> 12:49.440
who've previously struggled
with mental health

12:49.440 --> 12:52.160
are more susceptible
to postnatal depression.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.160
Yes.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.839
Would you consider trying some medication?

12:55.839 --> 12:59.640
No. Thank you. But, um...

13:00.800 --> 13:03.839
I know that my hormones
are all over the place

13:03.839 --> 13:05.599
and that it's normal.

13:05.599 --> 13:09.719
And when I was depressed before,
I got through it without medication,

13:09.719 --> 13:11.240
and I'd like to try that again.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.199
Well, we'll keep an eye on things.

13:14.959 --> 13:15.920
Thank you.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.880
Thanks a lot.
She tried to prescribe me medication.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.920
Well, that's good.
I think you might need some.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.640
Why are you being so weird about it?

13:35.640 --> 13:38.000
Because you embarrassed me, that's why.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.760
Because I know my own brain.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.959
I'm fine.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.480
Anyway, I have to go to the studio.
Can you take her?

13:44.480 --> 13:49.000
No, I... I can't take her. And you don't get
to snap my head off whenever you want.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.760
You said you weren't doing anything.

13:50.760 --> 13:54.520
My plans changed. I've got a second date,
and I need to get my hoo-hoo waxed.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.599
When did you go on a first date?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.199
And it's not a hoo-hoo! It's a vulva!

13:59.199 --> 14:00.320
Absolutely.

14:02.839 --> 14:05.599
<i>Any students wishing to attend
the student counselor debate,</i>

14:05.599 --> 14:07.360
<i>please make your way to the atrium.</i>

14:07.360 --> 14:13.599
Otis! I have got some information
that looks very, very bad for O.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.199
I feel like a wizard in this bit.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Abracadabra!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.839
- Hey, I think it's quite good.
- Yeah, that's great.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.880
What made you wanna
paint your foster homes?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.280
Um...

14:34.880 --> 14:35.920
Hmm.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.920
- So I lived with nine different families.
- Wow.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.199
Every time we'd get settled,
they'd just move us on to the next one.

14:43.199 --> 14:48.880
There was one family that did actually
want to, uh... adopt my brother and me,

14:48.880 --> 14:52.000
but, uh... that fell through.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.479
The whole system is just broken,
and it makes me angry.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.479
So I paint about it.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.360
I still don't know
what I wanna say with my photos.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.120
- Aimee.
- Yeah?

15:08.120 --> 15:10.240
- You literally never stop talking.
- What?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.120
So you've definitely got plenty to say.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.120
Stop underestimating yourself.
That's all I'd say.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.719
Thank you.

15:25.000 --> 15:25.839
Aimee, I, um--

15:25.839 --> 15:29.160
Please stop talking, 'cause I think I know
what you're gonna say.

15:29.959 --> 15:31.040
I think I like you.

15:32.079 --> 15:33.839
I think I like you too.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.479
- Shit. This is really terrible.
- What do we do?

15:40.479 --> 15:42.120
I need to talk to Maeve.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Right. Is that me?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.120
See you there.

15:47.040 --> 15:47.959
Uh...

15:54.880 --> 15:55.920
Hey, Frog. You ready?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.680
Yeah, who was that?

15:57.680 --> 15:59.280
- Wanted a lighter. I said no.
- Did he?

15:59.280 --> 16:00.760
Yeah. What the fuck are you doing?

16:00.760 --> 16:04.319
- Get off that fucking bag!
- No. Let go. I'm not doing anything--

16:05.520 --> 16:08.160
- Have you started dealing again?
- No. No, I haven't.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.760
- Are you using?
- No, of course I'm not using.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.120
- Fucking lying to me!
- Fuck off. I said I'm not.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.199
- Show me your arm.
- Fuck, Maeve!

16:17.199 --> 16:18.520
All right! Calm down.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.319
Maybe I have started using a little bit.
It's not a big deal. I'm gonna stop soon.

16:22.319 --> 16:25.120
You're a fucking idiot, Sean.
Fucking idiot!

16:26.000 --> 16:28.479
- Oh, get off your high horse, Maeve!
- Fuck you, Sean!

16:28.479 --> 16:29.800
You might be smarter than me,

16:29.800 --> 16:32.280
but we came from
exactly the same shithole!

so, uh, opening statements?

17:17.680 --> 17:20.599
- Thanks, Principal Lak--
<i>- </i>  Hi, everyone. I am O.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.720
Vote for me,

17:21.720 --> 17:25.159
and I promise that I will continue doin'
what I have already been doin',

17:25.159 --> 17:27.919
serving you all
with openness and integrity.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.680
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Um... Ahem.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.600
Well, I am Otis Milburn,
and you should vote for me

17:34.600 --> 17:39.080
because I came up with this original idea
to set up a therapy clinic on campus.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.520
It's because I believe all students

17:41.520 --> 17:46.159
should have access to unbiased information
and counseling on sex and their bodies.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.440
Oh, I suppose I'd better ask a question.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.640
I've got a question for Otis.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.440
Who is this man?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.760
- That's my dad. And--
- Correct.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.000
- This is Otis's father, Remi Milburn.
- Oh my God.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.360
Now, his writing is quite popular
amongst certain men's rights groups.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.560
And, if you don't mind,
I'd like to read you

18:09.560 --> 18:11.120
an extract from his latest book.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.440
- Is this allowed?
- It is.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.880
- Here we are.
- Yeah, it's fine.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.240
"In order to attract a woman,

18:16.240 --> 18:18.240
- the modern man finds himself..."
- It's fine.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.320
"...unable to assert his natural authority."

18:21.320 --> 18:23.760
- I don't see how this is relevant--
- Thank you, Otis.

18:23.760 --> 18:26.320
If you don't mind,
I'd like to finish. Thank you.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.440
"Forced into a submissive role,

18:28.440 --> 18:30.399
which not only emasculates him,

18:30.399 --> 18:33.560
but creates a society
disinterested in harmony."

18:34.560 --> 18:37.040
Wow. Thank you, Remi Milburn.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.760
Otis Milburn,

18:41.360 --> 18:44.679
would you agree that men
have a natural authority over women?

18:45.520 --> 18:47.440
No. Of course I don't.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.440
Look, my dad just writes that stuff
to sell books.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.040
I'm not him, and I don't agree
with anything he says.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.399
- That's interesting.
- Is it?

18:54.399 --> 18:57.360
It is. Because I would argue
that the way you have behaved,

18:57.360 --> 19:00.000
particularly towards me,
has been pretty sexist.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.200
That is ridiculous.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.919
And I think it's inappropriate that
you're even bringing my family into this.

19:04.919 --> 19:06.679
I disagree. People need to know

19:06.679 --> 19:08.720
what kind of person
they're getting advice from.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.200
I agree with that.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.440
- So, O, I have a question for you.
- No, I'm not ready to move on.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.960
- I have a few more points to make.
- I thought this was a debate.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.360
Please continue, Otis.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.360
Thank you, sir.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.200
O, what advice would you give to someone
who's recently been ghosted?

19:24.840 --> 19:27.840
Well, I would need a little bit more
information than that, Otis.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.880
Sure.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.880
PK, it's true, isn't it,
that O ghosted you last term?

19:34.399 --> 19:36.919
Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

19:36.919 --> 19:40.560
And you're not the only one
who's been strung along and tossed aside.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.520
- There are others.
- You did it to me too.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.919
I tried to talk to you about it,
but you ignored me.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.360
- Well, I--
- I felt like shit.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.080
You stamped on my heart.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.000
I--

19:51.000 --> 19:53.320
Can someone go and check on her?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.800
He's so right!

19:56.440 --> 19:58.320
I'm not sure I would want to be counseled

19:58.320 --> 20:01.399
by someone who clearly cares so little
about people's feelings.

20:01.919 --> 20:03.120
Hmm.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.240
Uh, we... Um...

20:09.560 --> 20:11.000
Okay... um...

20:15.520 --> 20:16.919
Um...

20:18.440 --> 20:22.399
I deserve to be called out
on my past behavior.

20:22.399 --> 20:25.280
I have withdrawn
from several relationships

20:25.280 --> 20:28.840
without proper communication,
and that is not something that I condone.

20:29.360 --> 20:33.720
I think that leaving people
without closure just isn't right.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.040
And I am an absolute arsehole
for doin' that, and I am owning that.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.679
However, this hasn't just happened
in a vacuum.

20:40.679 --> 20:43.919
I have actually been
on my own personal journey recently.

20:43.919 --> 20:47.960
And... well, it's not something
that I was going to talk about

20:47.960 --> 20:49.360
until I felt ready to,

20:49.360 --> 20:54.080
but I guess you have kind of
forced my hand there, Otis.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.320
Um...

20:56.159 --> 20:58.040
So... uh...

21:00.280 --> 21:01.120
Um...

21:02.440 --> 21:04.640
Oh God! Um...

21:05.240 --> 21:06.880
I am asexual.

21:08.520 --> 21:12.520
And I really enjoyed the friendships of
the people that I ghosted. I really did.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.360
But when it started to move into
somethin' more intimate,

21:15.360 --> 21:17.760
I... I felt really overwhelmed
and uncomfortable.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.520
I didn't know how to deal with
the feelings.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.520
I didn't have the words
to articulate that.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
So I did the cowardly thing,
and I just ran away,

21:24.040 --> 21:26.720
and that is something
that I really regret.

21:27.240 --> 21:31.240
But unlike some people,
I can accept criticism when it is valid.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.960
And I really hope you all believe me

21:32.960 --> 21:36.040
when I say
that I am working hard on doing better.

21:36.800 --> 21:42.399
I am working on accepting myself
and... and feeling proud of my identity.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.040
Thank you.

22:04.439 --> 22:05.560
That was bad, man.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.679
What just happened?

22:09.679 --> 22:12.399
Well, I think she's won,
and you've been canceled.

22:14.439 --> 22:15.280
Yeah.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.480
- Come in.
- Sorry. I had to bring Joy again.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.640
No worries. Would you like a cuppa?

22:26.159 --> 22:29.439
Oh no. I did not wet myself. Ice pack.

22:29.439 --> 22:33.360
I rubbed some of my son's
home-brewed chili oil on my vulva.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.320
- Oh.
- I might have burned my clitoris.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.360
- Oh boy.
- I figured you're a therapist.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.960
- Don't mind me sharing personal stuff?
- No problem.

22:40.880 --> 22:41.840
- Tea.
- Yes.

22:41.840 --> 22:42.760
- Thanks.
- Great.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.439
- I'll wash my hands.
- Good.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.960
There you go.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.040
Is that the, uh... chili sauce?

22:50.040 --> 22:51.120
Ha ha! You're funny.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.320
Yeah, peri-peri
for the peri-perimenopause.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.439
Oh.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.320
How long have you been perimenopausal?

22:57.320 --> 23:01.000
Oh, couple of years, I guess.
I haven't had an official diagnosis.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.760
It's just the hot flashes

23:02.760 --> 23:05.439
and desert-like vagina
are a bit of a giveaway.

23:06.679 --> 23:08.919
Well, you know, you don't have to suffer.

23:09.520 --> 23:13.000
There are plenty of treatments on offer
if you call your GP.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.200
I'm very busy. I work a lot.
I'm a workaholic.

23:16.200 --> 23:20.880
That's what my ex-wife reckons, but mostly
I'm in here just playing with dinosaurs.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.679
But I think I'm fine.

23:22.679 --> 23:25.159
Yeah, it's not like I'm sick, you know.

23:25.159 --> 23:27.640
Just uncomfortable.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.280
Especially today.

23:29.280 --> 23:33.960
So, you otherwise feel good in yourself?
No mood changes?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.040
What the fuck do you mean by that?

23:36.720 --> 23:39.800
- Oh. Well, some--
- Oh. That is a joke. I'm sorry.

23:39.800 --> 23:40.720
- Too soon.
- Fine.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.520
I mean, my sons keep telling me
I'm a bit more emotional than normal, but...

23:44.520 --> 23:49.040
Sometimes our loved ones can see us
much more clearly than we see ourselves.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.679
Honestly...

23:54.399 --> 23:56.439
I think I'm embarrassed.

23:57.840 --> 24:00.200
You know, so many women don't seek help,

24:00.720 --> 24:02.439
but it's because the subject of...

24:03.520 --> 24:08.439
yeah, menopause is still
so... stigmatized in society.

24:08.439 --> 24:10.200
It's fucking ridiculous.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.640
But even if you don't go
for any of the treatments,

24:13.640 --> 24:17.720
I think even just calling
might help you feel more empowered,

24:17.720 --> 24:20.560
and there is no reason to feel shame.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.880
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.320
There's the Jean I hired.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.159
Hello again! Like, more of that on air.

24:27.159 --> 24:31.399
Yes, well, I... I did feel better
after the last show, I have to say.

24:31.399 --> 24:33.120
- Yeah, about that.
- Mmm.

24:33.120 --> 24:38.720
Listen, Terry wants me to hire O on
as your permanent cohost.

24:38.720 --> 24:42.320
He thinks the idea
of having two sex therapists,

24:42.320 --> 24:44.880
you know, one young and one old-er,

24:44.880 --> 24:47.080
is the hook that we've been looking for.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.760
How do you feel about that?

24:48.760 --> 24:50.320
Do I have a choice?

24:50.840 --> 24:52.000
Yeah.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.320
Nah. No.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.760
Right.

24:55.760 --> 25:00.480
I love my sister, I really do,
but she is so tightly wound.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.280
She's been like that since she was a kid.

25:03.280 --> 25:07.800
She has to control everything in her life,
and she doesn't know how to have any fun.

25:09.439 --> 25:11.800
My husband Greg's exactly the same.

25:12.439 --> 25:15.600
He's such a downer. I'll be eating dinner
with him and thinking,

25:15.600 --> 25:17.320
"Christ, Greg, you're depressing."

25:17.320 --> 25:20.320
"Everything you do makes me sad,
even the way you eat chicken."

25:20.320 --> 25:22.080
Ow! Fuck! Shit!

25:22.080 --> 25:23.760
Remember that I'm not Greg!

25:23.760 --> 25:26.560
Sorry, love, but brace yourself.
There's more where that came from.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.000
- Ah!
- Oh! What the fuck?

25:29.600 --> 25:30.560
Don't itch it.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.199
Um... Oh, sorry, it's been declined.
Have you got another card?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.640
No.

25:38.159 --> 25:39.240
Um...

25:40.560 --> 25:42.520
Just give me a second.

25:45.280 --> 25:46.960
Oh...

25:48.880 --> 25:49.720
Hi.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.679
Turtle, hi.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.919
<i>My, um</i>... <i>my card has been declined.</i>

25:52.919 --> 25:56.439
I think they put a block on it.
Could you pay for a wax over the phone?

25:56.439 --> 25:59.320
- Didn't they block it the other day?
- Yeah, I'll pay you back.

25:59.320 --> 26:03.640
Okay. Can you just speak to the lady?
Thank you. She's gonna...

26:04.760 --> 26:08.439
Hello. Yeah, well,
full bush, front and back.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.520
You all right, mate?

26:22.199 --> 26:24.960
Just gettin' to know each other a bit,
aren't we? Yeah?

26:29.080 --> 26:31.320
Sorry. I, uh... I was cleaning, and...

26:31.320 --> 26:33.120
I wasn't... Yeah.

26:36.960 --> 26:40.000
So, how come you left school?

26:40.600 --> 26:44.320
Uh... just... I wasn't very good at it.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.760
Yeah, me either.
I'm dyslexic, so that didn't help.

26:48.439 --> 26:51.760
I was lucky, my...
my dad let me come and work here.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.120
I think he realized
there was no point pushing me.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.159
I've seen your dad
picking you up for driving lessons.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.399
He must be supportive too?

27:00.919 --> 27:01.760
Uh...

27:02.480 --> 27:06.280
Not really. I've always been
a bit of an embarrassment to him.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.760
What do you mean?

27:08.760 --> 27:11.080
Well, he was the headmaster at my school.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.800
And I just couldn't get it.
More I tried, the worse I got.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.840
He used to yell at me a lot.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.720
Sounds like a bully.

27:22.199 --> 27:24.960
Yeah, it's... a little bit scary.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.640
But now he seems to be trying to, I dunno...

27:29.240 --> 27:32.560
trying to be a normal dad,
I suppose, or something.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.320
Can I show you something?

27:40.120 --> 27:43.159
Okay, don't think it's weird, but, um...
Yeah, put that down.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.480
I think that horses
can help heal anything.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.919
- So, if you just trust me...
- Yep.

27:48.919 --> 27:52.159
Just relax.
Put your hand on his belly.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.960
- Then put a hand here.
- Uh-huh.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.439
Yeah, and, yep.

27:56.439 --> 27:57.840
- Do the thing.
- Okay.

28:00.399 --> 28:01.640
Feel his heartbeat.

28:03.399 --> 28:04.480
Feeling it?

28:05.120 --> 28:10.800
Okay, tell me that... that doesn't make
everything else feel... calm.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.640
Feels a bit weird
to be huggin' a horse, but...

28:14.840 --> 28:15.800
yeah, it does.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.720
Yeah, great...

28:19.720 --> 28:22.520
Oh shit. I've got a class to teach.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.280
Okay, I'll see ya.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.480
You should come and shadow me.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.640
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Jem.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.159
- You ready to go?
- Yes.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.840
Oh, Michael, I feel awful. I feel like
we're doing this behind Adam's back.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.639
I think we should get back together.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.199
We can't.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.439
Adam would be devastated.

29:03.439 --> 29:06.199
But... I've... changed.

29:06.959 --> 29:07.919
Michael!

29:09.959 --> 29:12.320
You've taken him on a few driving lessons.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.560
It's gonna take time to earn his trust.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.000
Okay.

29:39.879 --> 29:40.720
No.

29:46.280 --> 29:48.199
Okay. Here we go.

29:53.879 --> 29:57.720
Oh. Hello, darling. You're back.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.280
Yep. I'm goin' out.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.720
Wh... where are you going?
I... I haven't seen you in three days.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.120
I'm going to see Maeve.

30:04.639 --> 30:06.040
Why are you being cold?

30:07.199 --> 30:12.959
Because, Mum, you decided to bring
my main competition onto your radio show.

30:12.959 --> 30:14.159
What? Who?

30:15.120 --> 30:18.760
O? What?
I didn't even know that you knew her.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.639
I told you about
the other therapist on campus. That's her.

30:21.639 --> 30:22.560
Oh, wh--

30:22.560 --> 30:26.120
And now she's walkin' around
saying she's the star of <i>Sexology.</i>

30:26.120 --> 30:29.399
Well, she sort of is the star of <i>Sexology.</i> They...

30:30.080 --> 30:31.919
they've hired her as my cohost.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.959
Wh... Otis, you can't just
come and go as you please.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.679
You're still living under my roof,

30:37.679 --> 30:41.600
and I would like to continue
this conversation, please.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.720
- Why're you suddenly acting like a parent?
- What?

30:44.720 --> 30:49.199
You've paid zero notice of me
since Joy arrived. Like, at all.

30:49.199 --> 30:52.800
And I know it's been hard,
and I know having a baby is a huge deal,

30:52.800 --> 30:56.080
but you... you're treatin' me like an adult,
and I still need a mum.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.840
I'm gonna be late.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.720
- <i>Hello, surgery.</i>
- Yes, um...

31:30.720 --> 31:34.320
I'd like to book back in
to see Dr. Miller, please.

31:40.800 --> 31:41.959
Come in.

31:43.919 --> 31:45.520
- Hello.
- Hi.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.240
Ooh! Where are you going?

31:47.240 --> 31:50.080
I'm going on a date with Otis.
It's our first one.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.159
Oh, you look amazing.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.399
- How was today?
- Um...

31:55.600 --> 31:56.520
Not great.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.080
Yeah.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.719
Kind of realized we don't have anyone
to invite to the funeral.

32:03.639 --> 32:07.240
I still want Mum to have a proper goodbye,
so I need to figure it out.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.360
Definitely.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.120
Anyway, it's fine. How was your day?

32:15.480 --> 32:16.879
Yeah, it was fine.

32:18.399 --> 32:21.159
- Could you sit for two seconds? Sorry.
- Yeah.

32:22.760 --> 32:23.879
Um...

32:25.760 --> 32:29.199
So, you know how you thought
me and Isaac would get along?

32:29.199 --> 32:30.120
Yeah.

32:30.639 --> 32:34.800
Well, we've been doing art class together,
and we've kind of become friends.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.280
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.679
Um...

32:39.840 --> 32:42.600
- This is really hard to say.
- What? Aimes?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.959
I think we might like each other
more than that.

32:47.719 --> 32:48.919
Sorry.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.679
What?

32:50.679 --> 32:53.240
- So--
- Wait. Why are you laughing?

32:53.240 --> 32:55.480
Oh... I'm not. I was--

32:56.439 --> 32:58.159
- It's been a weird day.
- I'm so sorry.

32:58.159 --> 33:01.120
I wasn't expecting you to say that.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.000
Sorry, do you actually like Isaac now?

33:04.040 --> 33:06.320
Yeah. I mean, he's grumpy.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.240
- He's a bit rude. But he gets me.
- Yeah.

33:08.240 --> 33:11.560
Hanging out with him has made me realize
that I'm actually quite smart.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.040
Aimes, you are smart.

33:13.679 --> 33:15.639
- I thought you wanted to be single.
- I know.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.879
It's shit. I'm a shit person,
and I'm a shit friend.

33:18.879 --> 33:21.159
- You're not shit. Aimee, you're not shit.
- No, I am.

33:23.679 --> 33:25.159
How do you feel about it?

33:27.560 --> 33:30.879
Um... I can't really deal with this now.
I'm sorry.

33:30.879 --> 33:32.959
- Absolutely. I'm gonna go.
- We can talk another time.

33:32.959 --> 33:35.120
Of course. Complete wrong moment.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.959
- Um...
- I'm really sorry.

33:38.959 --> 33:40.840
It's okay. I... I'll see you.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.120
- Enjoy your date.
- Thanks.

33:44.719 --> 33:46.080
- I love you.
- Love you.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.919
- Don't tell me.
- I'm far too busy for that.

33:56.919 --> 33:59.560
- More than you though.
- Yes. Busted.

34:00.159 --> 34:01.439
How was school?

34:03.159 --> 34:04.480
- Yeah, fine.
- Hmm.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.839
I'm gonna say something,
and I need you both to not get defensive.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.239
- Okay?
- Hmm.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.319
I wanna find out who my sperm donor is.

34:16.319 --> 34:18.000
Wh... why now?

34:18.920 --> 34:20.719
- Ahem.
- Well, I've always had questions.

34:20.719 --> 34:23.679
Right, well, um... What kind of questions?

34:23.679 --> 34:26.440
Lots of things. Like, who am I?

34:26.440 --> 34:29.080
Well, you know
who you are, Jackson.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.280
- I said don't get defensive.
- Right.

34:32.920 --> 34:36.000
- What else?
- Like, does cancer run in their family?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.600
And their heritage.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.000
I'm so anxious, yeah?
And I feel like I was born with it.

34:41.520 --> 34:47.480
- And it didn't come from either of you.
- Well, your mum and I will think about it.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.760
- Uh...
- What?

34:50.520 --> 34:52.480
I don't think it's your decision, Mum.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.239
You have a lot going on,

34:54.239 --> 34:57.360
and you've got to get
your test results back from the doctor.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.960
- Exactly.
- And your A-levels are coming up, so...

35:01.720 --> 35:02.880
This is not the time.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.360
I knew there was no point
talking to you about this.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.520
Hey!

35:09.400 --> 35:11.400
I said
this would eventually happen.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.680
I am not...

35:13.920 --> 35:14.760
ready.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.560
Um...

35:22.560 --> 35:23.960
- Yeah.
- Uh...

35:25.640 --> 35:26.760
What can I get you?

35:26.760 --> 35:29.839
Can I get that bag of sweets there?
Top left, the white one.

35:29.839 --> 35:30.960
Sure.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.839
- The white one.
- Here you go.

35:33.839 --> 35:36.640
Thank you. Can I just tap that?

35:41.560 --> 35:43.240
Eric, it's good to see you again.

35:44.839 --> 35:46.000
Uh...

35:46.880 --> 35:49.920
My college is doing
their annual fundraiser,

35:50.560 --> 35:54.319
and I was wondering whether I could
donate the money to the soup kitchen.

35:54.319 --> 35:58.360
I enjoyed workin' there the other night
and bein' a part of the community.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.000
And I just think it would be sad
if it didn't continue.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.839
That is... very kind.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.400
Thank you.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.880
Uh... Great!

36:09.400 --> 36:10.600
Great.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.080
I will tell my friends.
Thank you, Pastor Samuel.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.440
You haven't been
coming to baptism classes.

36:17.799 --> 36:19.960
Yeah...

36:19.960 --> 36:21.560
Um...

36:21.560 --> 36:23.319
I'm not sure

36:24.280 --> 36:26.080
I want to be baptized anymore.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.520
Oh.

36:29.080 --> 36:34.080
I understand. But you are welcome
to come back at any time.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.000
I'll think about it.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.040
Hello.

36:43.799 --> 36:45.520
- Hi.
- Hi. Uh...

36:46.400 --> 36:48.360
I didn't know
you were part of church choir.

36:48.360 --> 36:53.319
Yeah. Um, you should stay and listen.
We've been workin' on a new song, so...

36:54.520 --> 36:56.080
- I'm gonna get warmed up.
- Okay.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.720
See you in a bit. Stay.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.359

39:43.920 --> 39:46.040
- Hi.
- Are you seeing something tonight?

39:46.040 --> 39:49.880
Yeah, um... I was supposed to be,
but I was stood up. Yeah.

39:49.880 --> 39:52.400
Apparently, he has had
a motorbike accident.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.319
Oh.

39:53.319 --> 39:56.240
- Bet he says that to everyone.
- This is Maeve.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.520
- Uh... This is my Auntie Jo.
- Hi.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.520
- Hello.
- Hi, Jo.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.240
Oh my God, she is a goddess.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.960
Look at her. You two are adorable.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.480
Okay, stop.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.280
- Okay, um... we should get the tickets.
- Yeah.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.319
- Yeah.
- It's gonna start.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.000
- But I'll see you.
- Nice to meet you.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.319
Could you, um... shout me a ticket?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.880
Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.

40:19.880 --> 40:21.400
- You don't mind, do you?
- No.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.520
Hey.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.319
Hey.

40:28.319 --> 40:31.920
I know you don't wanna be friends anymore,
but you don't need to be a dick about it.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.520
- What?
- It's okay. I won't bother you anymore.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.440
- Wait, Cal.
- No.

40:35.440 --> 40:38.400
Sorry, I'm late. Shall we go get popcorn?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.600
- Um, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.040
Hey!

40:44.040 --> 40:45.240
- Viv.
- Hey.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.200
Hey, sorry.

40:47.240 --> 40:50.160
Had a big fight with my parents.
I didn't know where else to go.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.200
Come watch the film with us.

40:52.799 --> 40:54.080
That's fine, right, Beau?

40:55.240 --> 40:57.960
- Yeah. I'll get another ticket.
- Cool. Thanks, man.

40:57.960 --> 41:00.560
I can't believe
that that twat stood me up.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.359
I mean, he told me
he wanted to get married and have kids.

41:04.359 --> 41:06.280
Talk about red fucking flag.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.600
- Where are we?
- Hi. Um...

41:08.160 --> 41:09.319
- These ones.
- Mmm.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.920
But if... Uh, we were...

41:12.640 --> 41:14.080
It's humiliating.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.760
Do you want a drink?

41:18.120 --> 41:19.640
Yes, I want a drink.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.000
- Tequila? Yes, my friend.
- Mmm.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.480
I really like her.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.400
Mmm.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.359
Ah! Oh, that's strong.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.160
- Here we are.
- What a fucking pig.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.760
So, what happened, then?

41:40.760 --> 41:43.480
So I told them, and they freaked out.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.600
All right, lads?

41:44.600 --> 41:46.920
They said, yeah,
I'm not allowed to look for him.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.680
But I'm 18 now, so they can't stop me.

41:51.359 --> 41:54.640
Do you think it's a good idea
to go behind your parents' backs?

41:54.640 --> 41:57.000
- What's behind their back?
- Oh, nothing.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.839
Thanks.

41:58.839 --> 41:59.880
Film's starting.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.680
Is this a fucking
black-and-white film?

42:02.680 --> 42:06.120
<i>"You pay the balance at once," he says,
"or I'll hand you over to the police."</i>

42:06.120 --> 42:09.319
<i>- You ought to have seen the chap's face.</i>
- So sad. Oh my God.

42:09.319 --> 42:10.480
<i>Changed his tune...</i>

42:10.480 --> 42:13.400
Oh shit.
They haven't turned the subtitles on.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.040
- I can go ask.
- Oh, no, no, no.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.720
- You don't have to do that. Let's watch.
- <i>You can't expect much spirit from a man</i>

42:18.720 --> 42:21.000
<i>- with only one lung...</i>
- Cheers, everyone!

42:21.000 --> 42:23.200
<i>I thought something must be wrong
when you didn't come.</i>

42:23.200 --> 42:25.319
<i>I'd have popped in to explain,
but I had a date.</i>

42:25.319 --> 42:27.120
<i>- Oh, good morning.
- How's the eye?</i>

42:27.120 --> 42:31.040
- "How's the eye"?
-"Very fine, actually. Thanks for asking."

42:31.040 --> 42:33.880
- "Feels like it's clearing up."
- "Yes, looks very good."

42:33.880 --> 42:35.960
<i>- And I to the grocer's.
- What exciting lives...</i>

42:35.960 --> 42:38.200
- "An exciting life we lead."
- I'm gonna go.

42:39.319 --> 42:42.040
<i>I'd been to the Palladium, as usual,
but it was a terribly long film.</i>

42:42.040 --> 42:44.799
<i>- I was afraid I'd be late.
- </i>  Okay, I'm gonna see if he's okay.

42:44.799 --> 42:47.680
<i>- As I came up onto the platform...</i>
- All men are arseholes.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.760
I mean, not you, Otis.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.200
You're actually quite sweet,

42:51.200 --> 42:57.000
but most men are big, fucking,
gaping, prolapsed arseholes.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.080
Sh!

42:58.080 --> 42:59.720
You, sh!

42:59.720 --> 43:01.040
- Look...
- Sh...

43:02.160 --> 43:04.720
Relax, Otis. Have some tequila.

43:04.720 --> 43:08.799
Beau. Beau! Wait. What's wrong?

43:09.680 --> 43:11.920
Why is he talking to you
about this private stuff?

43:12.520 --> 43:15.080
And... and crashing our date.
He's obviously into you, Viv.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.560
I've told you it's not like that.
We're just mates.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.760
Okay. If you say so.

43:21.799 --> 43:24.560
But I don't think you know
how great you are.

43:25.760 --> 43:30.560
And we've got mock exams comin' up,
so don't let him distract you, all right?

43:30.560 --> 43:31.640
Yeah.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.560
I'm sorry I got upset. I just...

43:34.400 --> 43:36.960
I... I think I'm falling for you.

43:36.960 --> 43:39.799
- You don't have to say anything.
- I think I'm falling for you too.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.720
Bitch!

43:56.520 --> 43:58.879
Sh.

43:58.879 --> 44:01.200
Hey, Maeve,
give me another sip.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.480
Give me another sip.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.359
Just one more.

44:23.359 --> 44:24.440
Sorry. I'm sorry.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.160
Please stop throwing popcorn.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.080
- They'll kick us out.
- Sorry. Okay, I won't.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.839
- I'm going to get the usher.
- Okay.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.160
Good. Can you tell him
to change the film as well?

44:37.160 --> 44:39.920
'Cause this one is slow.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.839
- Tell you what a good film is.
- Jo, please...

44:43.839 --> 44:47.359
- What's that one with Lady Gaga?
- Just be quiet.

44:47.359 --> 44:50.640
- They're gonna kick us out.
- And that guy, and he pisses himself.

44:50.640 --> 44:51.879
And he's really sad.

44:51.879 --> 44:54.720
Now that's a good... That is a good film.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.799
Excuse me, madam.

44:57.799 --> 44:59.080
- Oh!
- You need to leave.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.359
- I'm...
- We're going. Stand up. Stand up!

45:01.359 --> 45:04.160
- I am standing up!
- Just take this.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.000
Ooh!

45:06.000 --> 45:08.319
- I'm sorry.
- I am so sorry.

45:08.319 --> 45:10.319
- I might be a bit sick.
- Maeve, please help.

45:10.319 --> 45:12.440
- I'll be sick if I don't eat...
- Just wait till you're...

45:12.440 --> 45:13.839
- You're so lovely.
- ...home. Oh, Jo...

45:13.839 --> 45:15.520
- Oh, thank you.
- I like you so much.

45:15.520 --> 45:18.560
- In the car. Hey, mate. You okay?
- Don't be sick on the seat.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.120
Belt on. There's your bag.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.200
Hey, mate. You know where you're going?
Just up the hill. Here's 20.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.839
- All right, mate.
- Okay. Cheers.

45:31.520 --> 45:32.400
- Maeve!
- Bye.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.640
Where you going?
We've got a table booked for dinner.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.720
- We can do it another day. Come on.
- But...

45:40.040 --> 45:41.000
Oh, yeah...

45:46.040 --> 45:47.760
- Aww!
- There she is.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.200
You're not gonna get in.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.799
Ahem.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.240
Uh...

46:11.680 --> 46:12.600
Uh, really?

46:12.600 --> 46:13.760
Yeah, why?

46:14.400 --> 46:15.640
You scared?

46:20.680 --> 46:21.760
Follow me.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.080
Okay. Oop!

46:23.080 --> 46:24.680
Ooh!

46:24.680 --> 46:26.799
So many fucking steps. Oh God!

46:28.359 --> 46:29.839
Fucking bush.

46:29.839 --> 46:31.440
I'll fucking take you up.

46:33.359 --> 46:34.760
Sh... Okay.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.839
Okay... We're down now.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.080
Oh fuck. Oh my God. Jesus.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.000
Fucking gibberish.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.400
Jean.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.440
Jean, I...

46:54.120 --> 46:55.000
Are you drunk?

47:02.359 --> 47:05.240
I know that you're upset
about the doctor's,

47:05.240 --> 47:08.160
but you're the best sister I've ever had.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.600
I'm your only sister.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.200
You're so kind to me.

47:11.200 --> 47:16.520
You're such a... a kind, kind woman,
and I'm a mess.

47:16.520 --> 47:19.440
- Mm-hmm.
- No wonder no one loves me.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.400
- Well, I love you, Jo.
- I know you do.

47:24.400 --> 47:30.000
And that's why you're gonna be so angry
when I tell you about the debt.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.720
What debt?

47:32.720 --> 47:35.960
I owe a lot of money.

47:38.319 --> 47:39.560
How much is a lot?

47:39.560 --> 47:41.520
A lot. A lot.

47:51.080 --> 47:53.480
- Can I ask you a silly question?
- Yes.

47:53.480 --> 47:56.040
Why did you stop me when I was gonna
ask them about the captions?

47:56.040 --> 47:58.319
Oh, I don't like making a fuss.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.200
Why not?

48:00.920 --> 48:01.960
What do you mean?

48:02.879 --> 48:05.280
I mean, if it would have made
your experience better,

48:05.280 --> 48:06.720
I feel you should have asked.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.040
If I make it a thing
every time something like that happens,

48:10.040 --> 48:13.240
I will spend my life
having awkward arguments

48:13.240 --> 48:15.200
with non-disabled people.

48:15.920 --> 48:16.760
I feel that.

48:17.480 --> 48:21.040
I'm like that sometimes with my mom.
She doesn't understand my identity.

48:21.040 --> 48:25.200
I love her, but I get tired of
explaining everything to her all the time,

48:25.200 --> 48:28.000
so I've just kind of
stopped talking altogether.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.680
But you have a right
to ask for things when you need them.

48:31.680 --> 48:32.799
Hmm.

48:32.799 --> 48:37.200
It's a shame it's cloudy because
I would love to show you the stars.

48:38.960 --> 48:39.879
What?

48:39.879 --> 48:42.000
Are you seriously trying
to talk about stars?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.920
It's my signature move.
Thank you very much.

48:44.920 --> 48:47.000
You could also kiss me.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.560
- Oh my God.
- What?

49:02.520 --> 49:03.480
Sh.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.560
Shut up!

49:08.080 --> 49:09.120
Come on.

49:11.560 --> 49:12.720
Ta-da!

49:12.720 --> 49:14.480
Ah!

49:14.480 --> 49:15.839
- Ooh!
- Oh!

49:16.319 --> 49:17.200
Okay!

49:17.720 --> 49:20.000
- Come on.
- We definitely shouldn't be here.

49:30.080 --> 49:31.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.280
We should have sex.

49:48.879 --> 49:51.600
Well, you've just had a bit to drink.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.600
- I don't know...
- I'm fine. I'm not drunk.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.520
- Yes, you are.
- I wanna have sex with you.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.799
- Take your jacket off.
- Yeah.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.920
- Okay. This feels a bit weird.
- Why? It's fine.

50:11.920 --> 50:14.640
- Stop worrying about everything.
- Okay.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.399
Sorry, I can't. Stop.

50:31.399 --> 50:33.600
Sorry. Um... I spent the night with Ruby.

50:33.600 --> 50:36.440
I just... Uh, I had to tell you.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.879
It's when you were in America.
We were fighting, and...

50:41.720 --> 50:45.399
And we just... We slept together.
No, as in, we didn't have sex.

50:45.399 --> 50:49.080
Like, nothing happened. We just...
We just stayed in the same bed. Sorry.

50:56.879 --> 50:57.839
Fuck.

51:01.080 --> 51:02.120
Mmm.

51:03.040 --> 51:04.040
Hmm.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.319
Maeve?

51:07.160 --> 51:08.000
Well, fuck you.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.560
Did you hear that?

51:11.560 --> 51:14.520
- Yeah, it's usually...
- Shit. Someone's here.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.520
There's someone down there. Go, go, go.

51:18.520 --> 51:21.160
My jacket. I can't get arrested.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.960
- Oi!
- I'm too young.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.600
What do you think you're doin'?

51:25.240 --> 51:27.160
- Fuck!
- Oh, my neck.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.000
Stop playin' around.

51:30.600 --> 51:31.480
Out!

51:49.319 --> 51:51.319
Mum, this is Maeve.

51:54.120 --> 51:55.240
