(soft music playing)

01:00.000 --> 01:01.166
What did you get?

01:01.233 --> 01:03.133
I'm not sure. I think it's coconut.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.066
It's white inside,
but there's a red ring outside.

01:07.133 --> 01:11.166
Oh, that's my lipstick.
I don't like coconut.

01:11.233 --> 01:12.967
That's disgusting.

01:13.033 --> 01:14.734
That piece of chocolate
was in your mouth,

01:14.800 --> 01:16.400
and I put it in mine.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.700
We took a bite from the same piece
of chocolate.

01:18.767 --> 01:21.133
Call C. Everett Koop.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.300
I breast-fed you
for the first two years.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.967
You want to talk disgusting?
That's disgusting.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.400
All right. Enough already.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.467
It's not my fault
your date dumped you.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.033
Edgar didn't dump me.

01:32.100 --> 01:35.300
He and his lawyer left
on urgent business.

01:35.367 --> 01:38.367
Oh, please. The man
sells birdbaths for a living.

01:38.433 --> 01:42.133
What happened, a sparrow
slipped and is suing him?

01:42.200 --> 01:45.900
I can't believe it.
Raymond's got the flu.

01:45.967 --> 01:49.266
He can't take me
to the valentine's day dance.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.200
I guess I'll be keeping
you company, Dorothy.

01:52.266 --> 01:55.133
Why automatically assume
I don't have a date?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.767
She assumes a week has seven days.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.433
Have another chocolate, Ma.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.734
The doctor didn't know
what he was saying.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.533
They're not bad for you.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.133
Have you ever seen anything
more devastatingly beautiful

02:07.200 --> 02:10.266
-in all your life?
-Gosh, let's see...

02:10.333 --> 02:12.934
That was a rhetorical question,
Rose.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.533
When are your dates
picking you two up?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.533
We don't have any dates.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.967
No dates? On valentine's day?

02:21.033 --> 02:22.633
Oh, you poor things!

02:22.700 --> 02:25.834
Oh, I feel awful for you.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.300
The important thing
is to keep your spirits up

02:28.367 --> 02:31.200
and don't get upset. Oh...

02:31.266 --> 02:33.200
(telephone rings)

02:34.767 --> 02:35.700
Hello.

02:35.767 --> 02:39.066
Hello, Steve.
I'm all ready to go.

02:39.133 --> 02:40.433
What are you talking about?

02:40.500 --> 02:43.934
I spent all day getting ready.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.066
Oh, I could just
scratch your eyes out.

02:46.133 --> 02:49.934
I hate you. I hate you. Drop dead.

02:51.033 --> 02:53.467
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

02:53.533 --> 02:56.300
Well, don't wait up.
I'll, good night.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.867
Blanche.

02:57.934 --> 03:00.300
Steve canceled your date,
didn't he?

03:00.367 --> 03:01.767
Yes!

03:01.834 --> 03:03.433
How did you know?

03:03.500 --> 03:06.333
I'm clairvoyant, Rose.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.700
You're lucky.

03:07.767 --> 03:10.734
I get into a pool,
I sink like a stone.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.667
But how did you know
about Blanche?

03:13.734 --> 03:15.667
I can't believe this.

03:15.734 --> 03:19.400
Stuck here on valentine's day.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.633
This is the worst day of my life.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.533
Worse things can happen
on valentine's day.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.066
You once had no date
on valentine's day?

03:28.133 --> 03:29.400
Please. Until I was 80,

03:29.467 --> 03:32.834
I was combing geezers
out of my blue rinse.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.000
I'm talking about something
that happened long ago.

03:36.066 --> 03:38.934
Sal and I drove
my father to a wedding,

03:39.000 --> 03:40.900
and we had car trouble.

03:40.967 --> 03:43.533
Sal and papa never got along,

03:43.600 --> 03:46.266
so there was trouble
before we left Brooklyn.

03:46.333 --> 03:51.400
In Chicago, the car started
making strange noises.

03:51.467 --> 03:54.967
Salvadore, don't pretend
you know about cars.

03:55.033 --> 03:58.633
You want to impress me? Eat with
a fork instead of a bread crust.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.033
If you ask me, he ran out of gas.

04:01.100 --> 04:02.066
Nobody asked you.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.367
Was I talking to you?

04:03.433 --> 04:05.066
I'm talking to my daughter.

04:05.133 --> 04:08.233
To me, you don't exist.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.800
Then who's driving you
to your niece's wedding?

04:10.867 --> 04:14.633
You're upsetting papa.
Find a mechanic. It's freezing.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.934
It's freezing in here.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
He decides to take a shortcut
through Chicago in winter.

04:23.066 --> 04:24.734
He didn't plan it that way.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.700
He lost the map. He didn't know
where he was going.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.567
I could have told him
where he was going.

04:28.633 --> 04:34.166
I told you where he was going
first time I met him, nowhere.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.734
You married a bum.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.100
Excuse me.
We're having a problem.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.233
I'm starting my lunch break,

04:41.300 --> 04:43.600
and I've got three jobs
ahead of yours.

04:43.667 --> 04:48.300
Beautiful! I've always dreamed about
spending the winter in Chicago,

04:48.367 --> 04:52.934
and, of course,
the volcano season in Pompeii.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.266
Look, here's 2 bucks.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.367
Lend me your tools
while you're gone.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.834
Help yourself, buddy.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.700
Salvadore, you can't open a beer.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.400
What will you do with tools?

05:05.467 --> 05:07.700
We'll be out of here in no time.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.500
The same words he used

05:09.567 --> 05:13.533
when you moved into that
crummy flat 12 years ago.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.600
Papa, he's trying his best.

05:15.667 --> 05:19.333
And that doesn't scare you?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.333
You're not being fair.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.734
You've never given
Salvadore a chance.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.200
I don't understand
what you see in this man.

05:26.266 --> 05:28.233
It's something I can't explain.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.100
Everything you say about him
is true.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.533
Lord knows,
he's not terribly bright.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.700
He's not terribly good looking
and not much of a provider,

05:35.767 --> 05:37.367
but I love him anyway.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.934
I don't know why.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.133
It's the little things,
you know what I mean?

05:43.333 --> 05:44.633
I got to take a leak.

05:46.266 --> 05:47.500
Can you find the bathroom?

05:47.567 --> 05:51.033
If not, I'll find a wall.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.000
Sal, you having any luck?

05:53.066 --> 05:56.500
To be perfectly honest... no.

05:56.567 --> 06:00.000
No? You bagiagaloop!
Can't you do anything right?

06:00.066 --> 06:03.266
-I'm cold, I'm tired, I'm hungry.
-You're hungry?

06:05.834 --> 06:07.667
Here. What's this?

06:07.734 --> 06:10.700
Today's Thursday,
valentine's day.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.967
Valentine's day? It's...

06:13.033 --> 06:15.633
Wait. We left Brooklyn the 11th,
so this...

06:16.767 --> 06:21.633
Sal... you planned this three days
ago before we left?

06:21.700 --> 06:27.233
Yep. I hid it under the seat
when I was loading the suitcases.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.633
Happy valentine's day, Sophia.

06:29.700 --> 06:33.033
I think this is what I was trying
to explain to papa.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.834
Come here, you big lug.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.900
-I'm ready. Let's go.
-What is that noise?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.166
-My guess is machine guns.
-What?

06:44.233 --> 06:46.500
I'm in the back
looking for the John.

06:46.567 --> 06:49.000
I see a bunch of guys
lined up facing the wall.

06:49.066 --> 06:50.934
So I figured the toilet is broken

06:51.000 --> 06:53.700
so I'm gonna wait
behind one of these guys.

06:53.767 --> 06:56.500
Suddenly, someone's yelling,
"Get out of there.

06:56.567 --> 06:58.033
You don't belong here."

06:58.100 --> 06:59.266
I said, "Wait a minute.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.066
I peed against
better walls than this."

07:03.533 --> 07:06.233
When I see he's holding
a machine gun.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.400
So I decide to take his advice.

07:08.467 --> 07:15.133
I move, everybody's falling
like flies on aunt Regina.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.333
Your imagination is running wild,
papa.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.834
This is Chicago, not Sicily.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.834
You're just a little homesick,
that's all.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.400
(machine guns firing)

07:23.467 --> 07:25.834
I saw another garage
a couple of blocks away.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.400
The car's not running.

07:27.467 --> 07:28.867
Hey, who cares? I am.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.266
Ma, that never happened.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.200
You were not at the same
valentine's day massacre.

07:36.266 --> 07:39.967
I didn't say I was at
the St. Valentine's massacre.

07:40.033 --> 07:43.400
I said I was at
a St. Valentine's massacre.

07:44.834 --> 07:49.133
It was Chicago, and it those days
it stood for two things.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.900
-What were they?
-How the hell should I know?

07:52.967 --> 07:54.000
I forgot.

07:54.066 --> 07:58.533
Well, let's not just sit around
wasting time eating chocolates.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.934
Let's do something constructive.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.433
Do you want to eat some ice cream?

08:02.500 --> 08:04.734
That's not a bad idea.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.233
Ok, Rose. Go get it.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.333
I'm too weak
from disappointment.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.100
Well, I'm disappointed too.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.333
So, what? Dorothy, make her get it.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.867
Get it, Rose.

08:14.934 --> 08:17.633
Why are you two
being so mean to me?

08:17.700 --> 08:19.467
We're in bad moods,

08:19.533 --> 08:21.700
and we remember
what you did to us

08:21.767 --> 08:23.633
last valentine's day.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.934
You promised you'd forget that.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.533
What happened?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.233
You don't remember what happened
last valentine's day?

08:30.300 --> 08:31.900
I'm 82.

08:31.967 --> 08:35.967
Be thankful I remember not to wear
my underwear outside my dress,

08:36.033 --> 08:37.700
most of the time.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.767
Tell your story.

08:38.834 --> 08:40.767
Last St. Valentine's day,

08:40.834 --> 08:43.934
we thought we'd go
away for the weekend.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.400
We went to this cute little
woodsy mountain retreat.

08:47.467 --> 08:51.600
Well, when we got there,
were we in for a surprise.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.233
Isn't this lodge great?

08:53.300 --> 08:56.934
Oh, yes.
It's just beautiful up here,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.633
the fresh air,
the wide-open spaces.

08:59.700 --> 09:03.166
Being in the mountains
puts me in a romantic mood.

09:03.233 --> 09:06.000
Dorothy, you ever make love
on top of a mountain?

09:06.066 --> 09:07.734
No. The closest I came

09:07.800 --> 09:12.033
was making love to a fat guy
called old smokey.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.967
Let's check in.

09:17.100 --> 09:20.433
(bell rings)

09:20.500 --> 09:22.600
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Sunny Meadows.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.767
Thank you.
We'd... whoa!

09:26.333 --> 09:28.967
His klingenspritzer's showing.

09:29.033 --> 09:32.000
Where would you
like me to put this?

09:32.066 --> 09:35.467
Oh. Buy me a drink,
and we'll talk.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.567
Blanche.

09:36.633 --> 09:41.867
I'm sorry. Just hold on to it,
them, I mean, the bags.

09:44.934 --> 09:47.200
Where do you put your tips?

09:47.266 --> 09:50.033
Who cares?
What is going on here?

09:50.100 --> 09:51.867
Obviously, there's some confusion.

09:51.934 --> 09:54.533
Sunny Meadows
is a clothing-optional resort.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.000
You mean, a nudist camp?

09:56.066 --> 09:58.000
We didn't know that.

09:58.066 --> 10:00.367
Who made the reservation?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.467
Don't look at me.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.433
Rose, you made the reservation.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.033
I know. Just don't look at me.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.700
Look, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.500
This isn't for us.
We'd like to leave.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.600
You're with us tonight.

10:14.667 --> 10:17.433
The bus doesn't leave down
the mountain till tomorrow morning.

10:17.934 --> 10:19.967
Ladies,
may I show you to your room?

10:20.033 --> 10:21.266
Just point the way.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.333
Oh, good.
It's on the second floor.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.467
Thanks a lot, Rose.

10:30.533 --> 10:32.967
This is a great
valentine's weekend.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.433
Stuck in a hotel at a nudist camp!

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

10:38.567 --> 10:40.600
I misunderstood the brochure.

10:40.667 --> 10:44.400
"Fun in the buff
at a mountain retreat.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.900
Hike, swim, and play volleyball

10:46.967 --> 10:49.266
while the sun beats down
on your fanny."

10:50.967 --> 10:52.133
Call David Horowitz.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.000
How can they get away
with this misrepresentation?

10:56.066 --> 10:58.300
How can people run around

10:58.367 --> 11:01.166
showing their naked bodies
to total strangers?

11:01.233 --> 11:02.066
It's disgusting.

11:02.133 --> 11:04.233
-It's sickening.
-It's terrible.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.266
Yoo-hoo!

11:06.333 --> 11:09.233
Get away from that window
for two seconds!

11:09.300 --> 11:11.867
Come see this guy
playing volleyball.

11:11.934 --> 11:15.133
Blanche, will you stop acting
like a teenager.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.200
You have seen naked men before.

11:17.266 --> 11:19.400
What is the big deal, whew!

11:21.333 --> 11:23.200
Is that a legal serve?

11:24.867 --> 11:28.266
Everybody seems to be
having such a good time.

11:28.333 --> 11:33.767
You know... the more
you stare at everyone,

11:33.834 --> 11:35.767
the more natural it seems.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.300
I've been thinking
the same thing.

11:38.367 --> 11:41.166
Why don't we just
put our inhibitions aside

11:41.233 --> 11:42.734
and have some fun?

11:42.800 --> 11:45.333
We don't know anybody here,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.800
and we'll never
see these people again.

11:47.867 --> 11:49.567
And I'm really getting hungry.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.767
I wouldn't mind getting dinner.

11:51.834 --> 11:55.033
Let's cast caution to the wind,

11:55.100 --> 11:57.166
get buck naked,
and have a good time.

11:57.233 --> 12:01.166
If I had a dollar for every time
you've said that, I'd be wealthy.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.533
I'm starting to chicken out.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.633
Don't you be self-conscious.

12:12.700 --> 12:17.133
There's probably people here
with much worse bodies than yours.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.900
Then let's just do it.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.200
Ok... ok,
we're almost there.

12:37.266 --> 12:40.800
-Here we go.
-Wait a minute. This is ridiculous.

12:40.867 --> 12:44.667
We can't go through an entire dinner
holding these hearts.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.500
Dorothy's right.

12:46.567 --> 12:50.266
How will we cut our meat?

12:50.333 --> 12:53.700
Either we do this or not.
What's it going to be?

12:54.934 --> 12:57.033
We go at the count of 3.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.500
Ready?

12:58.567 --> 12:59.767
-1...
-1...

12:59.834 --> 13:00.967
-2...
-2...

13:01.033 --> 13:01.700
-3!
-3!

13:10.567 --> 13:14.133
Excuse me, ladies,
but we always dress for dinner.

13:15.700 --> 13:20.166
And in your case, please do that
for all three meals.

13:28.967 --> 13:31.533
(mellow music playing)

13:32.033 --> 13:36.433
What are we sitting around
all depressed about?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.767
Just 'cause it's valentine's day
and our dates dumped us?

13:39.834 --> 13:40.600
Yes, Blanche.

13:40.667 --> 13:44.367
I just wanted to hear it
before having more ice cream.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.700
I have an idea.

13:46.767 --> 13:50.333
Let's go out to dinner and
celebrate valentine's day ourselves.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.834
Having no dates doesn't
mean we can't have fun.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.166
It doesn't?

13:55.233 --> 13:58.467
Rose is right.
This is hardly a disaster.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.967
We're not the only women
without valentine dates.

14:02.033 --> 14:03.033
Ma, you want to join us?

14:03.100 --> 14:05.900
I can't. I have a date.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.033
You do?

14:07.100 --> 14:09.266
She's trying to annoy us.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.867
No, I'm not.
I have a date.

14:12.367 --> 14:14.266
What's his name?

14:14.333 --> 14:16.333
I can't tell you.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.300
Have I met him?

14:18.367 --> 14:20.333
He's from out of town.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.600
Where is he taking you?

14:25.033 --> 14:27.633
I can't say.
Security reasons.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.533
None of this is true.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.066
Ok, I'll tell you.

14:31.133 --> 14:33.300
It's Julio Iglesias.

14:33.367 --> 14:34.433
You satisfied?

14:36.734 --> 14:38.266
We'll make the reservation
for four.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.467
She'll tell us the truth
when she gets hungry.

14:40.533 --> 14:41.900
That is the truth!

14:41.967 --> 14:45.734
He was visiting his aunt.
He liked my spunk.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.667
It's not easy for anybody

14:47.734 --> 14:50.500
to accept being dateless
on valentine's day.

14:50.567 --> 14:52.767
What's so special
about Valentine's Day?

14:52.834 --> 14:56.400
It's the most romantic day
of the year.

14:56.467 --> 14:59.000
George proposed to me
on valentine's day.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.567
You told us already.

15:00.633 --> 15:04.333
So, what!
You don't have anywhere to go.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.066
Besides, I was going to tell you

15:06.133 --> 15:09.834
about another night
many years later.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.100
Same little romantic bar
where George proposed.

15:13.166 --> 15:17.300
Our finest champagne...
and two glasses.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.467
Very romantic.

15:19.533 --> 15:21.967
Well, it is St. Valentine's day,
after all.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.500
Pour both of them.
I'm not expecting anybody.

15:24.567 --> 15:27.900
It's St. Valentine's day,
not St. Patrick's day.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.500
I'm not drinking both,
just celebrating.

15:30.567 --> 15:34.900
My husband proposed to me here
on valentine's day,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.367
then we made it a tradition
and came back every year.

15:38.433 --> 15:39.900
Since he passed away,

15:39.967 --> 15:43.000
I've just continued
the tradition by myself.

15:44.967 --> 15:48.367
That's so romantic...
proposing over champagne.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.000
I never think of things like that.

15:51.066 --> 15:53.567
I'm going to ruin this night.

15:53.633 --> 15:56.734
You're thinking
of popping the question

15:56.800 --> 15:59.300
right here on valentine's day,
just like George did?

15:59.367 --> 16:02.133
Yeah. Now I'm thinking
maybe it's a bad idea.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.867
No, don't be nervous.
This was meant to happen.

16:05.934 --> 16:09.066
I'll help you by telling you
everything George said.

16:09.133 --> 16:11.834
I'm not sure that will work.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.333
We may be from
different generations,

16:14.400 --> 16:16.333
but some things never change.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.433
Love is love, period.

16:18.500 --> 16:22.767
Yeah, I suppose, but...
every couple is different.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.300
You just listen.

16:24.367 --> 16:26.533
We were sitting right here.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.834
George took my hand
in both of his,

16:29.900 --> 16:34.867
and looked deep into my eyes,
and he said, "You know, Blanche,

16:34.934 --> 16:37.533
you are a very special lady."

16:37.600 --> 16:40.633
Then he said he
couldn't bear the thought

16:40.700 --> 16:43.133
of spending even one day
out of the rest of his life

16:43.200 --> 16:46.000
without me right there.

16:46.066 --> 16:52.333
Then he said, "Blanche,
would you be my wife?"

16:52.400 --> 16:57.166
And... after I stopped crying,
I said yes.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.133
Blanche, you're right.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.734
Love is love, period.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.133
Some things never change.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.700
-I'm going to go through with it.
-Well, good for you, here!

17:06.767 --> 17:08.600
And thank you for listening.

17:08.667 --> 17:11.000
Oh, Victor... come on.

17:11.066 --> 17:12.900
Let's get a table.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.700
There's something
I have to tell you.

17:21.133 --> 17:22.300
Maybe I'm wrong.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.533
Maybe some things do change.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.066
Blanche,
what a lovely, sweet story.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.734
Tell me, did his girlfriend
ever show up?

17:36.400 --> 17:39.533
You're right, Blanche.
Some things never change.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.934
I'm getting ready for my date.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.967
Oh, Ma, knock it off.

17:44.033 --> 17:47.633
You're right. At 82,
what am I going to get ready?

17:47.700 --> 17:48.800
I always have my purse,

17:48.867 --> 17:52.233
and I shouldn't pee
until the motor's running.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.467
At any age, you ought to be
ready for your date.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.367
She doesn't have a date.

17:57.433 --> 18:01.867
I was thinking about
when we were getting ready

18:01.934 --> 18:05.767
to go away on that valentine's day
cruise with our steadies.

18:05.834 --> 18:09.166
And we were picking up
last-minute odds and ends

18:09.233 --> 18:11.266
in a drugstore...

18:11.333 --> 18:14.433
Ok, we have suntan lotion,
Chapstick,

18:14.500 --> 18:17.834
and half a dozen cheap,
tawdry, romance novels.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.266
Then we're all set. Everything
we need for the cruise.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.533
Maybe we don't have everything.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.734
What are we missing?

18:23.800 --> 18:26.500
We are going away
for a romantic weekend

18:26.567 --> 18:29.333
to the Bahamas
with Jeff, Rich, and Randy.

18:29.400 --> 18:34.600
It might be a good idea
to take along some protection.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.200
What kind of protection?

18:37.567 --> 18:41.200
Two armed Pinkerton guards.

18:41.266 --> 18:46.633
-No, Blanche is talking about...
-A Nestle's crunch?

18:48.133 --> 18:49.967
One over.

18:50.033 --> 18:53.367
-An enema bag?
-To the right.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.600
Dentu-grip?

18:54.667 --> 18:59.400
Condoms, Rose!
Condoms, condoms, condoms!

18:59.467 --> 19:01.500
Calm down, lady.

19:01.567 --> 19:03.367
You just get out of prison?

19:06.934 --> 19:10.066
Girls... what do you think?

19:10.133 --> 19:14.066
Well, it's not a bad idea,
but I'm a little embarrassed.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.934
-Oh, me too.
-Embarrassed?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.967
There's no reason
to be embarrassed.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.900
These are discreet professionals.

19:19.967 --> 19:21.433
It's a private matter.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.433
Whatever we buy is
nobody's business but our own.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.033
I'd like a package
of these, please.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.967
And I'll take these.

19:40.567 --> 19:43.133
And I'll take these.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.900
Now, that wasn't so bad,
was it?

19:45.967 --> 19:49.433
Joe, I need a price check
on some condoms.

19:51.867 --> 19:55.033
These three ladies here
want a couple of boxes

19:55.100 --> 19:57.467
of the king George Prophylactics.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.000
<i>The lambskins</i>
<i>or the ultra-sensitives?</i>

20:03.066 --> 20:05.033
Two of them have the lambskins,

20:05.100 --> 20:09.800
and the blonde has
the ultra-sensitive... in black.

20:16.734 --> 20:19.066
<i>Lambskins are $12.95.</i>

20:19.133 --> 20:22.066
<i>The black's a dollar extra.</i>

20:22.567 --> 20:25.867
Look at these people staring.
Oh, this is humiliating.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.000
I've never been
so embarrassed.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.967
What in hell are all you staring at?

20:33.033 --> 20:35.734
Haven't you ever seen
three vibrant, healthy,

20:35.800 --> 20:37.934
sexually active women before?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.133
Now, we're embarking
on a little weekend cruise

20:40.200 --> 20:42.734
with some long-time
gentlemen friends.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.266
If we decide to be intimate,
we'll be prepared.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.734
We're not embarrassed,
we're not uncomfortable,

20:48.800 --> 20:50.934
we are not humiliated.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.700
We'll walk out of here
with our heads high,

20:53.767 --> 20:55.100
secure in the knowledge

20:55.166 --> 20:59.200
that what we've done is morally
and socially responsible.

21:03.934 --> 21:05.100
Isn't that right, girls?

21:05.166 --> 21:06.500
I don't know this woman.

21:06.567 --> 21:10.033
I bought these for my brother.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.133
Rose. Rose!

21:17.967 --> 21:20.700
I was never so embarrassed
in my life.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.934
It turned out to be a lovely cruise.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.367
Well, it did not.

21:25.433 --> 21:27.934
We never had
to use those condoms.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.700
-You didn't?
-I used every one of mine.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.367
I filled them with water

21:33.433 --> 21:37.300
and threw them
at people in the limbo line.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.567
(doorbell rings)

21:39.633 --> 21:42.433
-I wonder who that is.
-Probably my date.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.734
Don't make a fuss over him.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.633
Latin entertainers
have a short fuse.

21:55.266 --> 21:57.166
Happy valentine's day.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.433
Raymond!
I thought you were sick.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.567
I thought you had to work.

22:01.633 --> 22:04.300
You said you had an emergency.

22:04.367 --> 22:05.433
So they're all liars.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.333
That's an asset for a surprise.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
We've got reservations for dinner.

22:10.467 --> 22:13.700
Ma, I bet you were in on this.

22:13.767 --> 22:14.934
Of course, I was.

22:15.033 --> 22:19.200
These dimwits' idea of romance
is a <i>Love Boat</i> rerun.

22:19.266 --> 22:21.066
Let's go.
The Limousine's waiting.

22:21.133 --> 22:24.066
Oh, you little devils.
Wait a minute.

22:24.133 --> 22:26.500
Honey, sure you won't join us?

22:26.567 --> 22:29.533
You got a marzipan bar
in your ear?

22:29.600 --> 22:33.400
I said I've got a date with,
you know who.

22:33.467 --> 22:36.000
Oh, Ma, we love you.

22:36.066 --> 22:37.967
Yeah. Right.

22:38.033 --> 22:41.166
-You fell for it.
-I did.

22:51.734 --> 22:54.066
(knock on door)

22:54.133 --> 22:55.867
-Julio?
-Yes, dear?

22:55.934 --> 22:58.734
You didn't use the front door.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.233
What's the point
in going with Julio Iglesias

23:01.300 --> 23:03.000
if nobody's going to see us?

23:12.233 --> 23:13.600
Tell me.

23:14.467 --> 23:16.233
Once we hit Wolfie's Deli,

23:16.300 --> 23:19.633
I'd appreciate you serenading
me with "Begin the Beguine".

23:19.700 --> 23:20.633
We sing together.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.200
-Come on.
-Let's try it together.

23:23.266 --> 23:25.300
<i>♪ When they beguine ♪</i>

23:25.367 --> 23:27.900
<i>-♪ The beguine ♪</i>
-That's perfect.

23:35.166 --> 23:38.433
(theme music playing)
