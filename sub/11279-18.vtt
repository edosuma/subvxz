18:30.877 --> 18:32.178
That tastes like fish.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.514
I told you!

18:34.547 --> 18:36.483
[***]

18:39.319 --> 18:40.720
Back to clean out
your locker?

18:40.754 --> 18:42.622
Nope. Just back for good.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.190
Cool!

18:44.224 --> 18:46.192
NARRATOR:
<i>Hey, this ain't</i>Brokeback.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.328
Greg!
Sorry.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.230
So, what made you
decide to come back?

18:50.263 --> 18:51.664
I thought Corleone
was my problem,

18:51.698 --> 18:53.566
but then I noticed
the real problem.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.802
I'm little, skinny
and I can't fight.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.738
So no matter where I go,
I'm still the same guy.

18:58.772 --> 19:00.740
So they jumped you.
Yeah.

19:00.774 --> 19:04.344
I figure the bully you know is
better than the bully you don't.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.313
Hey, Dolomite.
Welcome back.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.648
[SIGHS]
It was rough without you.

19:08.682 --> 19:11.618
I had to go back to
beating up white kids.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.987
The next time
you decide to quit,

19:14.020 --> 19:16.389
could you let
somebody know?

19:17.791 --> 19:19.659
So, what do we do now?

19:19.693 --> 19:21.361
Same thing we always do.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.296
Glad to have you back, man.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.803
NARRATOR:
<i>That day I realized that no</i>

19:29.836 --> 19:31.638
<i>things were gonna be rough.</i>

19:31.671 --> 19:36.376
<i>But as long as I had Greg,</i>

19:36.409 --> 19:38.545
