00:02.252 --> 00:03.562
[Male weatherman]
Good morning, Chicago.

00:03.586 --> 00:05.004
The big question for Santa

00:05.088 --> 00:07.424
is can he handle
the Chicago weather.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.134
[Man] What do I want
for Christmas?

00:09.217 --> 00:10.635
How about a winning team?

00:10.719 --> 00:12.262
Any Chicago team.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.448
[Woman 1] You've already put
your wish in for Santa, right?

00:14.472 --> 00:16.891
[Woman 2] I sure have.
I wrote a list,
I checked it twice.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.144
[Male reporter] Blackhawk fans
around the world,

00:19.227 --> 00:20.687
fans everywhere have had...

00:20.770 --> 00:22.290
[Woman 3] And I love
this time of year.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.464
[Adult Jake]
We gotta hustle, Annie.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.024
- Come on. Let's go, go, go!
- [Phone chimes]

00:49.048 --> 00:51.342
That's my friends
trying to reach me, isn't it?

00:51.426 --> 00:53.219
You know,
if I had my own phone...

00:53.303 --> 00:57.474
Um, there's no quit in you,
and it's inspiring.
Still a hard no.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.726
Okay, let's say
I'm in a burning building.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.686
No. A burning pet store.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.397
No. A burning orphanage,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.357
and I need to make a phone call.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.151
- You'd feel so terrible.
- [Phone chimes]

01:08.234 --> 01:09.527
Lives are at stake!

01:09.611 --> 01:11.088
You're not getting a phone,
Annie. I'm sorry.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.989
I get more calls on your phone
than you do.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.449
That's not true.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.243
My friends have to text you
just to talk to me.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.703
It's embarrassing.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.872
I'm not embarrassing.
Maeve's dad is embarrassing.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.749
Whoa! [Grunts]

01:23.750 --> 01:24.750
Ow!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.712
Still? The ice?

01:27.796 --> 01:29.839
- [Santa] I told them
to salt it.
- [Adult Jake] Ow.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.883
- [Annie] You were saying?
- [Phone ringing]

01:31.966 --> 01:33.593
[Groaning] One second.

01:34.886 --> 01:35.886
Jake Doyle.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.141
It's for you.

01:40.225 --> 01:44.270
[Adult Jake] Fifty-eight
minutes to grandpa
and grandma's. With traffic.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.814
Boom!

01:45.897 --> 01:48.107
Hey, you wanna shoot pucks
in the driveway later?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.360
No, thanks.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.463
Why not?
I thought you liked it.
It's kind of our thing.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.780
I don't like hockey anymore.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.783
Oh, okay, well...

01:56.866 --> 01:59.327
Maybe we can build a snowman
with mom and your brother?

01:59.869 --> 02:00.869
Dad.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.454
We could...

02:03.498 --> 02:05.375
Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.211
Listen, kiddo,
I'm sorry about the phone.
It's not gonna happen.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.839
I hate to see you disappointed.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.842
Look, I know that this year
is a little bit different,

02:13.925 --> 02:16.135
but you can still have
a good Christmas.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.262
What about you?

02:19.848 --> 02:21.724
I always have a good Christmas.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.143
[Adult Jake] Hello?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.604
Mom?

02:26.688 --> 02:27.814
Must be out running errands.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.569
[Adult Jake] Katie? Charlie?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.237
[Annie] I'm bored.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.406
Why couldn't
we visit aunt lizzy
in Australia instead?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.908
Those flights
are crazy expensive.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.743
[Annie] Well...

02:40.827 --> 02:42.453
What am I supposed to do here?

02:44.205 --> 02:45.205
I...

02:49.878 --> 02:51.078
[Adult Jake] Come on, come on.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.007
Ta-da!

02:54.090 --> 02:57.343
- What is that?
- That's my Nintendo
from when I was a kid.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.721
[Annie] Hmm.
It looks like tupperware.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.804
Tupperware?

03:01.598 --> 03:02.598
Come on, let's play.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.185
Can I text Maeve
from your phone after?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.396
Can you...

03:08.479 --> 03:10.857
Yes, but can I show you
how this works first, please?

03:10.940 --> 03:12.020
- [Annie] Yeah.
- Thank you.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.155
Oh, first you have
to do this. [Blows]

03:17.238 --> 03:18.281
Why?

03:18.364 --> 03:19.782
I don't know, just how it works.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.035
- [Blowing]
- Nice. Maybe dust?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.581
[Laughs]

03:28.541 --> 03:30.168
I thought you said
grandma and grandpa

03:30.251 --> 03:32.462
didn't let you have video games
when you were little.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.545
They didn't.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.799
Then how'd you get it?

03:36.883 --> 03:40.219
When I was a kid,
I wanted a Nintendo
worse than you want a phone.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.387
That's not possible.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.016
You know what?
Today is your lucky day.

03:45.099 --> 03:49.479
Because I am now
going to tell you the story
about how I got my Nintendo.

03:49.562 --> 03:53.775
But it is possibly
the most amazing, dangerous,

03:53.858 --> 03:56.319
awesome story of all time.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.238
So... can you handle it?

03:59.322 --> 04:02.241
Is it dangerous
because I might die
from boredom?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.743
That's a good point.

04:03.826 --> 04:07.580
The year was 1987.
Or was it '88?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.290
No. '85, bears.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.774
- Super bowl was in '86...
- Okay, does it
really matter, dad?

04:12.293 --> 04:13.378
Okay, okay.

04:13.461 --> 04:17.130
The year was the late '80s.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.341
We'll call it December.

04:19.175 --> 04:22.553
I was 11 years old.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.098
In the winter,
if the streets were plowed,

04:25.181 --> 04:29.644
I could make it
to Timmy keane's house
in just under eight minutes.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.648
[Annie] On a bike?
How fast were you going?

04:33.731 --> 04:34.774
[Adult Jake] Super fast.

04:34.857 --> 04:35.960
[Annie] Did you wear a helmet?

04:35.984 --> 04:38.027
[Adult Jake] Yeah, of course.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.154
We always wore helmets
in the '80s.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.365
Was it green?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.701
Um, yeah. It was green.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.262
[Adult Jake] Could I just
tell the story?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.766
- [Annie] Yeah.
- [Adult Jake] Thanks.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.673
[Panting]

05:01.801 --> 05:04.220
[Children chanting]
Nintendo! Nintendo! Nintendo!

05:04.303 --> 05:06.431
Nintendo! Nintendo!

05:06.514 --> 05:08.558
[Adult Jake] The rule
at keane's was simple.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.811
The first ten kids
to get through his door
got to play Nintendo.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.604
You know how you meet
some people,

05:13.688 --> 05:15.457
and you have no idea that
they have a lot of money?

05:15.481 --> 05:18.026
Yeah. Timmy keane
was the opposite of that.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.695
A known psycho,

05:20.778 --> 05:22.798
he had the tendency
to lose his mind
on a regular basis.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.950
- [Umpire] You're out!
- You! You! You!

05:26.034 --> 05:27.285
Stupid!

05:27.368 --> 05:29.162
Idiot grandma!

05:30.955 --> 05:33.499
[Adult Jake] It was
an early lesson
in god's cruelty...

05:33.583 --> 05:38.504
Giving the only Nintendo
in town to a rich kid
like Timmy keane.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.508
And every kid
at Mary Todd Lincoln elementary
was at his mercy...

05:42.592 --> 05:43.843
Including my best friends.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.679
Oh, another Saturday
in the trenches.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.264
[Inhales]

05:48.347 --> 05:50.308
[Adult Jake] Mikey trotter.

05:50.391 --> 05:54.729
Tough, tenacious.
Was allowed to watch
r-rated movies, and it showed.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.814
I wanna set land mines
in this yard.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.068
Like in platoon,
blow everyone up.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.694
Sounds dangerous.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.237
[Adult Jake] Evan Olsen.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.449
Nervous, allergic to bees
and spaghettios.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.201
Probably has to go home soon.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.078
I probably gotta go home soon.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.454
More Nintendo for us.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.955
[Adult Jake] Tammy Hodges.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.291
Smart, confident,
baseball card genius

06:15.375 --> 06:18.169
and future ceo
of Hodges industries.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.796
My canseco rookie went up
two bucks!

06:19.879 --> 06:21.714
Yeah, that used to be
my canseco.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.816
[Adult Jake] Teddy Hodges.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.425
Tammy's twin brother.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.637
Future assistant to the ceo
of Hodges industries.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.013
Hey, guys. What's up?

06:29.097 --> 06:30.765
[Adult Jake] Oh, yeah,
and this kid.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.534
Sorry I'm late.
I was on the phone
with bon jovi.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.684
[Adult Jake] Jeff farmer.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.103
Pathological liar.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.438
Not really our friend,
but always around.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.065
And you left school
early yesterday

06:39.148 --> 06:41.268
because Tom Cruise needed you
to stunt double for him?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.653
He knows I too
have a need for speed.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.404
So, you didn't have diarrhea?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.031
It was both.
Tom Cruise and diarrhea.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.117
The two are not
mutually exclusive.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.827
Shut up. He's coming out.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.995
[Children chanting]
Nintendo! Nintendo!

06:53.079 --> 06:54.872
[Children screaming]

06:59.836 --> 07:02.213
Nintendo!

07:02.296 --> 07:04.173
- Nintendo!
- Silence!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.550
[Adult Jake] 8:00 A.M.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.176
Game time.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.054
Any of you huddled masses
care for some Nintendo?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.764
[All] Yeah!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.307
Pick me! Pick me!

07:13.391 --> 07:15.935
You. You. You.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.229
You're good.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.648
Yes! I got in!

07:22.275 --> 07:23.693
[Mikey] We're in!

07:23.776 --> 07:25.278
I love this place.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.530
- [Mikey] Whoa!
- [Tammy] Awesome.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.200
[Adult Jake] And there she was,
glistening in all her
gray plastic glory,

07:31.284 --> 07:35.746
a maze of rubber wiring
and electronic intelligence
so advanced

07:35.830 --> 07:37.582
it was deemed not a video game,

07:37.665 --> 07:41.460
but an 8-bit
entertainment system.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.212
Say hello to my little friend.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.715
Hey, boots off!

07:45.798 --> 07:47.958
There's tape over there
if you have holes
in your socks.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.762
Don't touch the wall!
It's French.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.784
- Wait, my brother's
still outside.
- [Teddy] Let me in!

07:55.808 --> 07:56.827
[Timmy] You know the rules.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.311
First ten, that's it.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.270
But it's Teddy.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.688
[Mocking] "But it's Teddy."

08:00.771 --> 08:01.771
[Teddy] Jerk!

08:02.607 --> 08:04.108
Too bad, so sad.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.072
[Adult Jake] There was
no denying he was a jerk.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.613
There was also no denying
he had the coolest basement

08:08.696 --> 08:10.948
in the entire central time zone.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.951
A pool table, shuffle board,
pinball machine,

08:14.035 --> 08:16.621
pop machine,
movie-style popcorn-maker.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.264
[Timmy] Hey, no sucking
on the soda pop.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.333
[Adult Jake] And a snack drawer
better stocked

08:20.416 --> 08:22.710
than most supermarkets
in the greater Chicago area.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.087
You guys hungry?
You want some pop-tarts
or something?

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340
- Yeah. That'd be great.
- [Jake] Sure.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.883
- [Beeping]
- Mom.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.220
Mom!

08:32.303 --> 08:34.388
- Mom, wake up!
- [Mrs. Keane] What?

08:34.472 --> 08:35.472
Get me a pop-tart!

08:35.514 --> 08:36.765
[Mrs. Keane] Uh, how many?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.491
- Just one.
- [Mrs. Keane] Does anybody...

08:42.438 --> 08:43.438
[sighing]

08:43.522 --> 08:44.522
[Yaps]

08:48.611 --> 08:49.654
Winner stays.

08:50.988 --> 08:51.989
Die, die!

08:52.073 --> 08:53.950
You're dead. You're dead.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.285
You're dead. [Laughs]

08:56.369 --> 08:57.411
Hey, you guys wanna play?

08:58.079 --> 08:59.330
Psych! Boom!

09:00.206 --> 09:01.791
I can do this all day.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.085
[Adult Jake] As I sat there
and watched Timmy keane

09:04.168 --> 09:08.214
blast away an inch
from the screen
to his evil heart's content,

09:08.297 --> 09:09.757
one thing became clear.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.926
I needed to get my own Nintendo.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.219
Fast.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.553
[Festive music playing]

09:18.975 --> 09:20.393
[Kathy] Oh, gee!

09:21.310 --> 09:23.896
Y-o-u-r is possessive.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.982
[Adult Jake] For weeks,
I'd been plotting

09:26.065 --> 09:29.026
how to get my parents
to say "yes" to a Nintendo
for Christmas.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.279
[Kathy] "Scout" is misspelled.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.448
[Adult Jake] Tonight was
the night I'd finally put
my plan into action.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.326
- [Kathy] "Atticus"
is misspelled.
- [Jake] Mom.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.245
Uh, hey, mom.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.330
I'm so sorry, mom,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.249
but I got some ketchup
on my sweatshirt.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.335
Oh, gosh. All right,
let's get that out
before it sets in.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.499
You know,
we bought that sweatshirt
two sizes too big.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.266
- I know.
- It's gotta last you
another year.

09:51.215 --> 09:54.343
I don't know. Wow! Jesus!

09:54.427 --> 09:56.679
[Adult Jake] My mom
was always multi-tasking.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.139
She thrived on the chaos.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.224
Two things at once,
she was golden.

10:00.308 --> 10:04.186
But if you gave her
a third task to juggle,
things got dicey,

10:04.270 --> 10:07.356
and you could get her
to agree to stuff she wouldn't
normally agree to.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.401
Hey, so, mom, I was thinking,
for Christmas...

10:10.484 --> 10:12.570
A kid who thinks.
How refreshing.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.864
Maybe you could teach
my students that.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.365
Sure?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.242
But just to make
Christmas shopping

10:18.326 --> 10:20.578
a little easier for me
this year...

10:20.661 --> 10:22.496
How about getting me a Nintendo?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.374
Sure. That sounds great.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.376
[Adult Jake]
Mom gauntlet passed.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.586
[John] God bless it!

10:28.669 --> 10:30.212
Is everything all right
in there?

10:31.255 --> 10:34.050
Has anyone seen my skil saw?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.218
I think it's in the shower.

10:36.302 --> 10:40.222
No, that's my Jigsaw.
I need my skil saw.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.892
John, the skil saw
is underneath the Jigsaw.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.269
You have to look harder.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.481
- Those are for the muellers.
- [Stammers]

10:48.564 --> 10:50.691
[Adult Jake] Of the 6,000
Christmas cookies

10:50.775 --> 10:52.401
my mom had baked over the years,

10:52.485 --> 10:55.237
no one in my family
had ever actually eaten one.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.739
Hey, the milk is expired.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.574
No. That's a suggestion.
It's fine.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.784
Jake! Where...

10:59.867 --> 11:01.285
- Oh.
- What?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.579
Come on in here and help me.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.682
[Adult Jake] Normally,
helping my dad with whatever
half-baked renovation

11:05.706 --> 11:07.706
he was doing
would be the last thing
I wanted to do,

11:07.750 --> 11:10.753
but tonight,
I was a man on a mission.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.005
I'll be right in, dad.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.340
[Kathy] Wow, look at that.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.592
He finally wore you down.

11:16.675 --> 11:20.471
[Adult Jake] My dad
was something
of a dyslexic Bob vila.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.808
It was well-known
up and down linwood Avenue
that in 1978

11:23.891 --> 11:28.312
my father went to
install a kitchen cabinet
and had not stopped since.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.689
[Kathy] Please wear
your safety glasses this time.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.358
[Annie] Did you wear
the safety glasses?

11:32.441 --> 11:33.442
[Adult Jake] Absolutely.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.528
Really?

11:37.863 --> 11:38.863
Kind of.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.538
All right,
you can take that off now.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.415
- [Jake] What?
- [John] Take it off.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.582
Oh.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.167
We'll look for
the glasses later.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.878
It's really
more of a suggestion.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.425
[Jake] Wow.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.260
How'd you get your hands
so strong?

11:59.343 --> 12:02.304
I've been working with them
for over 30 years, that's how.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.181
- That's so cool.
- Yeah?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.201
Maybe you guys could
get me something
for Christmas

12:06.225 --> 12:08.936
that builds up
my hand strength,
so I could help you out better.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.150
You know,
I like the sound of that.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.233
Like a Nintendo?

12:16.485 --> 12:17.485
Yeah.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.823
Done. [Chuckles]

12:20.906 --> 12:22.700
All right. Let's go clean up.
Come on.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.493
[Annie] You did it, dad!

12:24.577 --> 12:25.578
They said yes.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.329
I was on cloud nine.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.999
So the story's over, right?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.375
Cool. Can I text Maeve now?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.376
Uh-uh.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.672
[Kathy] John,
that cup is disgusting.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.216
This is the exact cup
I was drinking out of when...

12:39.300 --> 12:40.759
When they beat the north stars

12:40.843 --> 12:43.179
- in the conference semis
in '85.
- Fine. Yep.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.056
It's a beautiful memory
and a gross cup.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.933
Totally.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.935
Stop saying "totally."
You sound like a moron.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.913
[John] And what's your retainer
doing out of your mouth?

12:51.937 --> 12:53.355
But we're eating.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.459
Do you know how expensive
that thing is? Put it back in.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.736
John, he really can't eat
with it in. It doesn't
work that way.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.363
Well, it won't work at all
if he loses it.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.782
I mean, orthodontistry
is the biggest racket.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.493
I could make
one of those. Easy.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.329
Couple of paper clips,
mouth guard...
[Whistles] Done.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.706
I'd like you to finish
the living room
and the dining room

13:10.789 --> 13:12.625
before you start work
on their retainers.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.711
If I had a retainer,
I'd wear it all the time,
no matter what.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.297
I know you would, honey.
You're such a sweetheart.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.884
Hey, you haven't seen
my air compressor, have you?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.427
It's in the backyard,

13:23.511 --> 13:25.711
right next to all the dog poop
that Jake didn't pick up.

13:26.055 --> 13:26.972
Hey.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.432
You haven't picked that up yet?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.683
Cry in a bucket, Jake.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.185
What have you been doing
all day?

13:31.268 --> 13:32.728
I was in Timmy keane's basement.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.230
What, you can't play outside?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.231
It's cold.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.941
It's not even below zero out.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.460
What've you been doing inside
all day?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.819
Probably playing the mimtendo?

13:40.903 --> 13:41.987
"Nintendo."

13:42.071 --> 13:43.739
That's what I just said.
"Intendo," John.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.367
You know,
I ran into Mrs. Trotter
at the Jewel today.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.078
Apparently, video games
have been doing

13:49.161 --> 13:51.914
all kinds of strange things
to children in Japan.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.749
Like what?

13:53.832 --> 13:56.710
They get so involved,
they completely forget
about everything else.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.920
School, friends.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.422
One little boy
had a brain aneurysm

14:00.506 --> 14:02.925
and stuff oozed out of his nose.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.761
I'm very glad
that we do not have one.
[Chuckles]

14:05.844 --> 14:08.556
But you said I could get one
for Christmas.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.600
I said nothing of the sort.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.270
Video games make you fat, Jake.
It's a fact.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.730
Cabbage patch kids
don't make you fat.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.107
[Jake] No, no, no.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.025
Dad, you said
I could have one, too.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.902
No, I didn't.
Well, okay, I did.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.655
But I thought that
it was an Asian tool brand,
like makita.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.032
You know what?
You should be playing outside.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.994
Evan Olsen almost got frostbite
from playing outside.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.912
He almost lost his pinkie toe.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.831
The olsens are weak stock.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.374
No Nintendo in my house.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.209
I second that.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.836
Me three,
and that makes a majority.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.632
Looks like a no-go
on the 'tendo.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.843
[Laughs]

14:45.926 --> 14:47.845
She's funny, John.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.764
[John] Best kid ever.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.975
[Adult Jake] And just
like that, it was gone.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.060
I was never getting
my own Nintendo.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.645
My life was over.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.401
Jake. Jake.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.361
Come on. You gotta focus, man.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.864
[Evan] His parents said
he couldn't get a Nintendo
last night.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.427
When my parents said no,
I was so mad,

15:08.490 --> 15:10.618
I started calling them
by their first names.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.038
Okay, well, channel that anger
into taking down jagorski.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.456
[Grunting]

15:16.415 --> 15:17.750
[Josh] Yeah!

15:17.833 --> 15:19.251

15:19.335 --> 15:20.586
Let's go!

15:20.669 --> 15:23.088
[Growling]

15:23.172 --> 15:25.591
[Adult Jake]
Every day before school,
we would gather,

15:25.674 --> 15:28.510
for reasons unknown,
to get pummeled by jagorski

15:28.594 --> 15:30.429
in the game
king of the mountain.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.806
[All screaming]

15:32.890 --> 15:35.934
My mountain! Mine!

15:36.018 --> 15:39.855
[Adult Jake] It was never
quite certain what grade Josh
"king of the mountain" jagorski

15:39.938 --> 15:41.231
was actually enrolled in,

15:41.315 --> 15:43.400
as the vast majority of his time

15:43.484 --> 15:45.712
was spent
in such foreign districts
as the principal's office,

15:45.736 --> 15:48.822
and the adult beverage
refrigerator case
at the gas station.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.867
[Growling]

15:51.950 --> 15:53.911
[Josh] Bye and bye.

15:53.994 --> 15:57.331
Yeah! Come on!

15:57.414 --> 16:00.668
He smells like my dad
after he practices guitar
in the garage.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.877

16:01.960 --> 16:05.589
of this delicious
strawberry cake?

16:05.673 --> 16:08.050
This is it. Let's go!

16:08.133 --> 16:10.052
- Why now?
- Do we have to?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.053
Come on!

16:11.136 --> 16:12.513

16:40.332 --> 16:41.417
Me too.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.936
Just think about
the power glove, man.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.254
What? What power glove?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.422
Yo, you didn't tell him?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.173
- I thought you told him.
- [Mikey] No.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.510
The power glove.
Keane got one last night.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.929
No way!

16:54.012 --> 16:55.389
- Yes, way.

to his house after school
to play it.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.525
He's gonna let us in?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.358
We gotta bribe him with gifts,
but yeah.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.444

Yeah. Four. Yeah.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.641
NASA moon rocks?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.184
Moon rocks? No.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.394
Summer sausage!

19:05.477 --> 19:07.437
- It's my dad's. It's gourmet.
- No.

19:09.356 --> 19:13.694
[Connor] I got
a goldfish, keane!
You want it?

19:13.777 --> 19:16.446
-But it's a good pet.
It's a fish.
-[Timmy] No.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.168
Good girl, good girl.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.628
[Dog growling]

19:39.177 --> 19:40.177
Fetch! Go!

19:43.974 --> 19:45.183
[Timmy] Settle down, peons.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.354
- Gentlemen.
- [Clears throat]

19:50.355 --> 19:52.441
Gentlemen and the Hodges girl.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.401
Behold the power glove...

19:55.193 --> 19:56.193
In all of its...

19:57.446 --> 19:58.446
Power.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.950
Timmy keane, dream journal.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.119
I had the dream
about Tammy Hodges again.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.496
She was on a white horse,
I was on a beach.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.957
- I don't know what that means.
- Turn it off!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.727
- [Mrs. Keane] Timmy,
do you have your jammies on?
- [Timmy] Mom, get out of here!

20:10.751 --> 20:12.294
[Mrs. Keane] Okay.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.172
- No one heard that. Understand?
- Yeah.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.423
[Exhaling]

20:18.175 --> 20:19.635
Behold...

20:19.718 --> 20:22.429
The power of the power glove.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.974
[Timmy] You ready, Hodges?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.858
Not everyone can use
these things, by the way.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.312
You have to be
specially trained
in taekwondo

20:30.395 --> 20:33.315
which is like karate,
but just more expensive.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.442
[Jake] What a tool.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.694
[Adult Jake]
Oh, man. This was it.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.947
The power glove. At last.

20:40.030 --> 20:43.742
Each one of us
in that basement knew we were
about to witness history.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.915
Feel the glove.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.458
Felt like an isotoner.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.460
This is how you really punch
with power.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.923
- [Timmy] Come on.
- [All] Oh!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.153
- [Mikey] Go, Tammy!
- [Teddy] Go, Tammy,
get him, get him!

21:02.177 --> 21:04.012
Boom! You can give up now.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.848
Nah. I think I'll win instead.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.642
[Mikey] Yeah, Tammy!

21:09.601 --> 21:11.228
Get him, Tammy! Get him!

21:12.270 --> 21:13.772
[All] Whoa!

21:13.855 --> 21:14.773
Come on!

21:14.856 --> 21:16.858
Work!

21:16.942 --> 21:19.170
[Adult Jake] We thought
he was just making excuses,
being a sore loser.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.572
But we'd later realized
a horror that defined
our generation.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.825
The power glove sucked.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.201
This glove sucks!

21:27.327 --> 21:28.787
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

21:30.998 --> 21:32.833
Come on, unleash your power!

21:35.293 --> 21:36.837
[Jake] Yeah, yeah!

21:36.920 --> 21:39.006
It's not working! Come on!

21:39.089 --> 21:41.216
[Man in game] Silence him!

21:41.299 --> 21:42.968
[All cheering] Yeah!

21:43.885 --> 21:46.054
Mommy, Tammy cheated!

21:46.138 --> 21:49.266
Sucks to lose... to a girl.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.059
- [All] Ooh!
- [Screams]

21:51.143 --> 21:53.061
[Adult Jake]
Maybe it was the glove.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.312
You tell 'em, keane!

21:54.396 --> 21:55.756
[Adult Jake]
Maybe it was the song.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.774
Chop, chop, chop!

21:57.858 --> 21:59.693
Hai karate, keane!

21:59.776 --> 22:02.946
[Adult Jake]
Maybe it was because
he was just such an idiot.

22:03.030 --> 22:07.034
But Timmy keane lost his
dang mind that day.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.828
Go, keane, go! Taekwondo!

22:09.911 --> 22:15.417
[All] Go, keane, go! Taekwondo!

22:15.500 --> 22:16.500
[Screams]

22:19.337 --> 22:20.377
[Kids screaming in horror]

22:21.339 --> 22:23.759
[All gasp]

22:23.842 --> 22:25.862
[Mrs. Keane over intercom]
Does anybody want some tang?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.721
I just made a batch.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.182
[Adult Jake] A marble
stuck in a nostril...

22:30.265 --> 22:31.767
Shattering mom's antique vase.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.644
Picnics in the fricking park
compared to this.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.897
For there,
lying under the weight

22:36.980 --> 22:40.442
of a smashed 42-inch
television set...

22:40.525 --> 22:42.360
Was a dead dog.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.653
What?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.113
The dog dies?

22:45.197 --> 22:47.282
There's a dead dog
in this story?

22:47.365 --> 22:50.285
Hey, what can I tell ya?
It was the '80s.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.953
Stuff got real.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.997
I thought you said
you were super safe
in the '80s?

22:54.081 --> 22:55.916
It was a complicated decade.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.334
Are you making all this up?

22:57.417 --> 22:58.794
No. No. No way.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.630
Okay, well...

23:01.713 --> 23:03.381
What happened next
in the basement?

23:03.465 --> 23:06.009
I mean,
I don't really care. But...

23:08.428 --> 23:09.805
What did you do?

23:09.888 --> 23:13.058
We did what any rational,
thoughtful, responsible kids

23:13.141 --> 23:14.976
would've done in our position.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.060
[All exclaiming] Run!

23:19.231 --> 23:20.482
[Evan] Why is everyone running?

23:20.565 --> 23:23.151
[Tammy] Go, go, go!

23:23.235 --> 23:25.654
- [Evan] What's happening?
- We gotta get outta here!

23:25.737 --> 23:28.073
[Evan] What's going on?
What's going on?

23:28.156 --> 23:30.676
- The sound of all
those bones breaking...
- What do you mean, "bones"?

23:30.700 --> 23:34.121
It's game over at keane's!
Just go! Go! Go! Go!

23:34.663 --> 23:36.498
Go!

23:36.581 --> 23:39.000
[Yells indistinctly]

23:39.084 --> 23:43.004
[Adult Jake] It was the end-o
of Nintendo at keane's
as we knew it.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.631
So many thoughts
raced through my head.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.842
Would I be arrested?
Would I go to jail?

23:46.925 --> 23:49.261
Or worse, would I ever play
Nintendo again?

23:57.435 --> 24:00.147
It's gonna be snow, snow, snow.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.982
[Lizzy] Snow!

24:02.065 --> 24:03.918
[Weatherman] We have
a northwest clipper
coming off

24:03.942 --> 24:05.253
- of the south side
of lake Michigan.
- Yes!

24:05.277 --> 24:07.529
God bless it.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.732
[Weatherman]
And at Christmas time
that's just perfect.

24:11.449 --> 24:14.077
Can't read Jenny jablecki's
handwriting on this, mom.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.454
[Kathy] If there is a heart
over the "i"...

24:16.538 --> 24:17.789
Mark it wrong and move on.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.542
Are we gonna have
a snow day today?

24:20.625 --> 24:23.712
I don't want anyone here
getting their hopes up.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.088
It's probably not gonna happen.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.299
I don't want anyone
getting upset, okay?

24:27.382 --> 24:30.051
[Adult Jake] In the history
of batavia, Illinois,

24:30.135 --> 24:32.095
there had never been a snow day.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.930
Not a single one.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.391
It could be 20 below
with a Soviet attack
on the way

24:36.474 --> 24:38.619
- and we'd still have school.
- [Reporter] We just
got this in.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.354
In Kane county,
the school closures
are as follows...

24:41.438 --> 24:43.023
- [Lizzy] Come on!
- [Reporter] Geneva,

24:43.106 --> 24:44.386
- come on!
- [Reporter] Elburn...

24:44.441 --> 24:45.960
- [Jake] Come on!
- [Reporter] South Elgin,

24:45.984 --> 24:48.737
[reporter] North Aurora,
and... That's it.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.906
- Stupid!
- Oh, no!

24:50.989 --> 24:52.824
Mary of god!

24:54.242 --> 24:56.786
I told you guys
not to get your hopes up.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.550
-[Jake] You okay, mom?
-[Kathy] All right.
You have to eat something.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.500
- Here.
- This is frozen.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.896
Yes, put it under your armpits
for two minutes,
it'll thaw out.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.755
Guys, coats, gloves.
What are we doing?

25:06.838 --> 25:08.024
Jake, don't forget your boots.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.091
Yeah. Don't forget
your boots, Jake.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.303
- [Lizzy laughs]
- [Sighs]

25:13.386 --> 25:18.099
[Adult Jake] My mother,
in a multi-tasking, cold,
coupon-induced bout of madness,

25:18.183 --> 25:20.936
had accidentally bought me
girl's boots.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.323
Back then,
they were a death sentence.

25:33.406 --> 25:36.493
I should note,
they were also flowered
and French.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.286
What do you mean,
"girl's boots"?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.789
Like they only fit girl's feet?

25:40.872 --> 25:43.500
No, they were just purple.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.085
So?

25:45.168 --> 25:48.296
Back then, people were
more close-minded
about fashion.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.799
And everything else.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.217
Ooh, pretty.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.638
Did you know that
esprit is French for "cool"?

25:56.721 --> 25:58.223
- Really?
- No.

25:58.306 --> 25:59.474
Just go ahead, I'll catch up.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.892
What if someone kidnaps me?

26:00.976 --> 26:03.270
They'll return you in,
like, five minutes.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.771
You shouldn't be doing that.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.606
Wait a second and shut up.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.149
You said a swear.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.609
I got a lot on my mind, lizzy.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.444
I got a lot on my mind too.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.989
Come on. Let's go.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.156
Let's go.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.038
[Sneezes]

26:26.793 --> 26:30.547
[Mrs. Hugo] It's called
the Dewey decimal system.

26:30.630 --> 26:34.301
Right. This is a life skill,
people, like cursive.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.804
When you're an adult,
and you wanna look
something up really quickly,

26:37.887 --> 26:41.182
you're gonna be very happy
that you learned
this today. Okay.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.102
All you're gonna have to do
is go to the library.

26:44.185 --> 26:45.746
Get your coats and boots on,
head on over...

26:45.770 --> 26:48.023
We talked to keane.
The dog's not dead.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.941
The dog's not dead?

26:50.025 --> 26:52.503
No, it just broke three legs
and a few ribs.
It's on life support.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.405
It's gonna make
a full recovery though. Right?

26:55.488 --> 26:56.781
I wouldn't count on it.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.326
That TV landed on her
like a house on a witch.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.911
But eventually
it'll be like nothing happened.

27:01.995 --> 27:06.124
Physically, maybe.
But mentally,
she'll never be the same.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.710
You're lucky
you didn't see it, Olsen.
You would have thrown up.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.588
I only throw up
from spaghettios.
It's a medical condition.

27:11.671 --> 27:14.049
He's really the shackleton
of the librarians.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.485
- And I'm not the only one
who thinks that, by the way.
- [Snoring]

27:16.509 --> 27:18.887
Wait, so does this mean
Nintendo's back on?

27:18.970 --> 27:20.323
- It gets
a little more specific.
- No.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.641
Keane's dad took it away.
It's really over.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.393
[Jeff] Did you guys hear?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.580
The loyal ranger scouts
are giving out a Nintendo
this year.

27:27.604 --> 27:31.232
Whoever sells the most wreaths
in the wreath-selling contest
gets one.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.235
-No way.
-Yes, way.
A sixth-grader told me.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.505
The same sixth-grader
who told you that
there were tryouts

27:36.529 --> 27:38.281
for the a-team? Yeah, right.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.034
Nope. That was a lie.
This one's real.

27:41.117 --> 27:43.536
We're gonna need
some solid proof, farmer.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.663
- Jake Doyle.
- Huh?

27:45.747 --> 27:48.517
Do you have something
that you'd like to share
with the rest of the class?

27:48.541 --> 27:49.793
Uh, no.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.395
Don't think I haven't
been watching you, Jake.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.855
You're the only one in here
with wet shoes.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.840
Now, you know the rules.
No boots, no recess.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.426
- But...
- I expect to see you in boots
at recess,

27:58.510 --> 28:00.470
or your name goes
on the board...

28:00.553 --> 28:01.638
With a check.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.681
So what's it going to be,
Mr. Doyle?

28:04.307 --> 28:05.307
Boots...

28:06.017 --> 28:07.102
Or a check?

28:08.353 --> 28:09.687
[Josh] Go, go, go!

28:13.149 --> 28:15.944
-[Josh] Catch it.
Get out there. Catch it.
-No.

28:16.027 --> 28:17.570
It changes colors
when I lick it.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.490
[Adult Jake] Connor stump

28:20.573 --> 28:23.118
was by far the weirdest kid
in school.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.744
He always carried around
a recorder

28:24.828 --> 28:26.996
and his lunch
was almost exclusively tuna.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.543
You ever put socks
and shoes on your hands
and just crawl around?

28:31.626 --> 28:33.002
[Growling]

28:33.086 --> 28:35.630
It's just me, Connor.
I'm not really a lion.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.900
- Jake, come on,
you're on our team.
- [Josh] Let's go. Line up.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.218
Just play without me.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.345
What're you doing back there?

28:42.429 --> 28:44.431
Ooh, is there
a dead squirrel again?

28:44.514 --> 28:46.182
Is it all furry and frozen?

28:47.225 --> 28:48.351
Dude.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.870
You're wearing
Katie sorrentino's boots.

28:49.894 --> 28:50.812
They're mine.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.230
Your mom use a coupon again?

28:53.189 --> 28:55.191
Let's go, trotter, you baby.

28:55.275 --> 28:56.609
Yeah, we gotta get you
outta here.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.028
If jagorski sees you,
he'll kill you.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.531
Hey. What're you...

29:01.614 --> 29:03.908
You're wearing
Katie sorrentino's boots.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.160
They're mine.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.454
That's it!
I'm coming over there.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.414
No, no! What do I do?
What do I do?

29:09.497 --> 29:12.500
Does anybody have some candy
or a nudie magazine
or something?

29:12.584 --> 29:15.253
I call dibs if there's
a dead squirrel
back there again.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.257
[Josh laughs]

29:19.340 --> 29:23.845
I think we got ourselves
a pair of girl's boots here.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.739
[Adult Jake] Painfully,
my mind flipped through

29:25.763 --> 29:28.766
the rolodex of punishment
I was about to endure.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.353
Weeks of wedgies, swirlies,
dead legs.

29:32.437 --> 29:37.192
I wanted to punch a kid's face
until it turned
into kool-aid so bad

29:37.275 --> 29:40.528
and I didn't get the chance...
Until now.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.863
- What's up, dork?
- Hi!

29:41.946 --> 29:43.990
How's four eyes?

29:44.073 --> 29:47.313
- [Adult Jake] But then,
I heard the voice of an angel.
- [Jeff] Guys, I got proof!

29:47.785 --> 29:49.078
[Jeff] Guys! Guys!

29:49.162 --> 29:51.002
It says it right here!
It really is a Nintendo!

29:53.833 --> 29:55.752
It's just a picture
of a dumb wreath.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.670
You gotta read it.

29:57.754 --> 30:01.883
"This year's first prize
is a brand-new Nintendo
entertainment system."

30:02.634 --> 30:04.969
[All exclaiming]

30:12.852 --> 30:14.020
I'm gonna kill you.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.814
[All cheering]

30:16.898 --> 30:19.734
[Adult Jake] Less than
30 minutes after
the final school bell

30:19.817 --> 30:22.695
I was fitted in my dress Greens
and on my way...

30:22.779 --> 30:25.323
Envisioning the acres
of Alaskan pine forest

30:25.406 --> 30:28.493
needed to cover
the amount of wreaths
I was about to sell.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.538
And I had my sales pitch
all planned out.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.747
[Clears throat]

30:32.830 --> 30:34.541
[Knocking]

30:34.624 --> 30:36.685
"I'm with the loyal ranger
scouts, ma'am,
and without your help

30:36.709 --> 30:40.004
thousands of boys may become
drug addicts and communists."

30:40.088 --> 30:41.756
- What?
- What?

30:41.839 --> 30:42.882
What? What do you want?

30:42.966 --> 30:45.260
Hi. My name is...

30:45.343 --> 30:47.762
Wait. You're not trying
to sell me something,
are you?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.056
Wanna buy a wreath?

30:52.767 --> 30:56.396
What, do you got
a learning disability
or something?

30:56.479 --> 30:59.732
Wait, you don't really got
a learning disability, do you?

30:59.816 --> 31:03.194
Good. Ma, this kid thinks
your wreath sucks!

31:05.530 --> 31:06.614
- [Door slams]
- Oh.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.954
[Jeff] Hey, Doyle.
Gotta look out for
those "no solicitor" signs.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.457
What're you doing here, farmer?

31:16.541 --> 31:17.685
- [Doorbell chiming]
- Ruining your life.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.294
You can't sell wreaths here.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.255
You think there are rules here,
Doyle? There are no rules.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.715
That Nintendo's mine.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.051
- I've already sold 67 wreaths.
- To who?

31:27.135 --> 31:29.304
People. Your mom.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.806
You're full of it, farmer.

31:31.889 --> 31:34.183
Hello, young lady.
I was hoping
your mother was home.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.769
I need to speak to an adult
in the house.

31:36.853 --> 31:40.273
And did I mention
how much I like your sweater?

31:40.356 --> 31:43.526
[Adult Jake] All over town,
the boys in green
pounded the pavements

31:43.610 --> 31:44.819
in record numbers,

31:44.902 --> 31:46.487
all in the name of Nintendo.

31:46.571 --> 31:51.075
A swarm of snot-nosed
Gordon gekkos had been born.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.995
Merry Christmas, ma'am.
Would you like to buy a wreath?

31:55.288 --> 31:57.206
Hello, ma'am. 'Tis the season.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.918
Merry Christmas, sir.
Do you think die hard
is a Christmas movie?

32:01.002 --> 32:03.671
Look at that,
it's already wreath-thirty?

32:04.756 --> 32:06.382
Um...

32:06.466 --> 32:09.093
"Douglas fir
Christmas wreaths."
Just say it!

32:09.177 --> 32:11.012
Why don't you just say it?

32:11.095 --> 32:14.599
'Cause I'm not in
stupid ranger scouts,
'cause I'm not a stupid boy.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.684
[Adult Jake] And it was
every kid for themselves.

32:19.437 --> 32:22.690
Kids who weren't
even in ranger scouts
were getting in on the action.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.484
I will not take no
for an answer!

32:24.567 --> 32:28.571
That is the first rule
of salesmanship!
The first rule!

32:28.655 --> 32:30.031
[Knocking]

32:30.114 --> 32:31.954
[Adult Jake] Even I was
getting the hang of it.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.537
Oh, are you here
to shovel my walk?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.706
No, I'm here
to sell Christmas wreaths.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.125
Okay. Um, let me see.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.919
My wallet's in my car.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.671
You want me to...

32:44.754 --> 32:47.340
Shovel my car out,
so I can get to it.
That would be great.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.925
Oh, I'll get the shovel.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.973
[Panting]

33:00.645 --> 33:03.231
[Kathy laughing]

33:03.314 --> 33:07.235
[Jeff] The tevatron particle
accelerator at fermilabs,
they get more headlines.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.820
But if you ask me...

33:08.903 --> 33:10.881
The most valuable
local resource
we still have today

33:10.905 --> 33:12.198
are our teachers.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.409
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Doyle.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.619
Merry Christmas, Jeff.

33:16.703 --> 33:17.829
Stay beautiful, Kath.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.416
She said I reminded her of you.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.585
See you later, Jake.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.715
Did it have to be farmer?

33:28.798 --> 33:31.092
He offered me an honest deal
at an honest price.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.010
There's nothing honest
about him!

33:33.094 --> 33:34.595
He's a pathological liar!

33:34.679 --> 33:39.100
Oh, I thought he was
a really nice boy.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.352
Those are for your mother.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.438
My mom would want me
to have one.

33:43.521 --> 33:47.233
I didn't even know that
you were selling wreaths
this year.

33:47.316 --> 33:51.112
He only cares about it now
because they're giving away
a nin...

33:51.195 --> 33:52.613
Night in Chicago.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.699
Yep. That's a new prize.

33:54.782 --> 33:58.327
At a hotel, I think,
in downtown?

33:58.411 --> 34:00.496
[Kathy] That's a peculiar prize
for an 11-year-old.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.623
That is a peculiar prize.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.584
Don't you think
that's peculiar, dad?

34:04.667 --> 34:06.502
God bless it.
Where the hell is it?

34:06.586 --> 34:08.463
The Phillips head
is in the butter dish.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.466
[John] No, that's not it.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.402
You know what, Jake?
If you wanna win that prize,

34:13.426 --> 34:15.969
you have to do
what I tell my kids
in class every day.

34:16.053 --> 34:17.638
Make like a vacuum cleaner.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.099
Suck it up and do the work.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.685
- [John groans]
- What are you looking for?

34:22.768 --> 34:23.936
My gourmet sausage.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.855
How the hell do you lose
a sausage?

34:25.938 --> 34:27.065
[Kathy] Dinner is served.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.360
I wanted to eat it with dinner.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.652
We're having salads.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.572
That's why I wanted to eat
the sausage.

34:35.656 --> 34:37.199
Well, maybe elwood ate it, dad.

34:37.283 --> 34:40.036
'Cause, I mean,
he's been pooping
so much lately.

34:40.119 --> 34:41.329
He has, hasn't he?

34:41.411 --> 34:42.580
You know how I know that?

34:42.663 --> 34:45.081
Because it still
hasn't been picked up.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.293
Uh, it snowed.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.337
Hey, that's no excuse, okay?

34:49.420 --> 34:52.924
Tomorrow morning, you,
that shovel, backyard.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.010
No, I'm totally supposed to
sell wreaths all day tomorrow.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.096
Well, too bad.
And stop saying "totally."

34:58.179 --> 34:59.096
It's not fair.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.224
Hey, if life was fair,

35:01.307 --> 35:04.018
it would be... a fair.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.187
Okay? But I don't...

35:06.270 --> 35:08.940
I don't see any carnival rides
around here, do you?

35:09.816 --> 35:10.816
Hmm.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.694
You just made that up,
didn't you?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.947
No, I didn't.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.490
It's an old saying.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.034
Listen!

35:20.117 --> 35:25.706
In the name of
the father, and of the son
and of the holy spirit...

35:25.790 --> 35:29.669
From thou thy bounty,
to Jesus Christ's name...

35:29.752 --> 35:31.963
- He is great.
- Amen.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.967
[Adult Jake] I was convinced
elwood had pooped
more times than any other dog

35:36.050 --> 35:38.553
in the history of the world.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.596
Our yard looked like
a vanilla cake

35:40.680 --> 35:43.558
that someone
dumped an entire bag
of chocolate chips onto.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.604
What's lizzy doing?
She can't help?

35:48.688 --> 35:52.233
You wanted the dog,
you pick up after it.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.235
You got the dog
before I was born.

35:54.318 --> 35:57.405
Who wanted the dog
is irrelevant, Jake.
Just pick up the dang poop.

35:59.866 --> 36:03.452
Come here.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.456
All right. Take a deep breath.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.625
Go ahead.

36:12.837 --> 36:13.837
You smell that?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.590
- Poo?
- No!

36:15.673 --> 36:16.674
Fresh air!

36:18.551 --> 36:20.303
That's all we had,
and we loved it.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.305
When I was your age,
we didn't have nintendos.

36:22.388 --> 36:23.514
You know what we did?

36:24.348 --> 36:26.350
Built forts in the woods.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.603
We'd gather up old lumber
and siding

36:28.686 --> 36:31.063
and whatever we could find
we'd build, like,

36:31.147 --> 36:33.566
watchtowers and rope ladders...

36:33.649 --> 36:34.901
Trapdoors?

36:34.984 --> 36:36.903
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we built trapdoors, too.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.947
- Cool.
- Yeah, it was cool.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.366
Yeah, we'd work on it
all year round, too.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.659
Kinda like the house?

36:45.703 --> 36:48.414
[Laughing] Yeah.
Kinda like the house.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.332
Yeah.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.630
Cry in a bucket,
that dog poops a lot.

36:55.713 --> 36:56.714
Yeah.

36:56.797 --> 36:57.797
Hey.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.718
Don't worry about
behind the shed.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.803
Just get the ones
around the house, okay?

37:03.888 --> 37:06.307
And then when you're done...

37:06.390 --> 37:08.559
You can varnish
these old hockey sticks.

37:08.643 --> 37:09.852
Why?

37:09.936 --> 37:11.729
Because they need to get done,
that's why.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.356
Come on, dad.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.709
You think I like paying taxes
and talking to our neighbors?

37:15.733 --> 37:17.234
No. But you gotta do it.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.945
I don't like doing that stuff!

37:22.365 --> 37:23.616
Careful with the varnish.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.748
[Jake] "Careful
with the varnish."
What am I gonna do? Drink it?

37:30.831 --> 37:32.041
I know how to be careful.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.592
We need to talk.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.010
What are you doing in my room?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.095
I need...

37:45.304 --> 37:46.889
Did elwood diarrhea on you?

37:46.973 --> 37:48.933
It's varnish. What do you want?

37:49.016 --> 37:50.059
I need your help.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.018
With what?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.895
Getting a cabbage patch kid.

37:52.979 --> 37:56.315
Santa didn't get me
a she-ra last year,
so I can't trust him.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.025
I gotta go through mom and dad.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.443
So what do you need me for?

37:59.527 --> 38:02.154
I need you to drop hints
for them to get me one.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.615
No way.
Why would I wanna help you?

38:04.699 --> 38:07.910
Now, I want a redhead
named abrona Fiona
with freckles and a...

38:07.994 --> 38:09.704
Why do you want
a dumb doll so bad?

38:09.787 --> 38:13.082
Because I've always wanted
a sister. Stop interrupting me.

38:13.165 --> 38:16.210
It looks bad
if I'm talking about it
all the time to mom and dad.

38:16.293 --> 38:19.380
We need a subtle attack,
and we gotta act fast.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.923
What are you gonna do for me?

38:21.007 --> 38:23.134
- Tell you how to win
a Nintendo.
- [Chuckles]

38:23.217 --> 38:25.177
You don't know
how to win a Nintendo.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.595
Okay, never mind.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.849
Wait.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.227
How can I win it?

38:33.310 --> 38:36.605
You promise to help me
get a cabbage patch kid?

38:36.689 --> 38:38.149
Yeah, sure.

38:38.232 --> 38:39.066
Promise?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.818
Yes, I promise already.

38:40.901 --> 38:44.238
Okay. You sold two wreaths
to miss sherman
yesterday, right?

38:46.032 --> 38:46.907
How do you know that?

38:46.991 --> 38:48.159
Don't worry about it.

38:48.242 --> 38:50.578
She bought a lot
because she's old, right?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.747
Old people buy stuff from kids.

38:52.830 --> 38:56.292
So what you need
are a bunch of old people
all in one place

38:56.375 --> 38:58.419
so you don't have to track
them all down.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.754
What's your point?

38:59.837 --> 39:02.506
Prairie pines, the nursing home.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.175
Two hundred old people,

39:04.258 --> 39:05.468
each with their own door,

39:05.551 --> 39:07.178
perfect for wreath-hanging.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.096
Wow.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.059
That's...

39:13.142 --> 39:14.643
That's a really good idea.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.854
I know. So we got a deal,
or what?

39:16.937 --> 39:18.022
Yeah.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.941
A redhead with freckles.
Don't mess it up.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.402
I'll be watching you.

39:25.613 --> 39:29.617
[Adult Jake] Prairie pines
nursing home didn't know
what was about to hit them.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.870
[Exhaling] "Suck it up.
Do the work."

39:37.416 --> 39:39.418
Hi, everybody.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.130
- Hi.
- Do you like blues?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.800
Hi! You look just like
my grandson.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.927
Oh, let me see those cheeks.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.013
[Adult Jake] But it turned out,
I didn't know what was
about to hit me.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.307
Because the world's fair
was here...

39:53.390 --> 39:56.644
And we were celebrating
the city's centennial.

39:56.727 --> 40:01.315
You see,
Chicago was founded in 1833.

40:01.398 --> 40:05.611
That makes it 100 years to 1933.

40:08.322 --> 40:09.323
Hold on.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.512
It's what he would've wanted.

40:43.190 --> 40:46.068
[Adult Jake] It took six hours
and ten cups of pudding,

40:46.152 --> 40:50.823
but I managed to sell
a whopping 47 wreaths
to the nursing home.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.158
All thanks to lizzy.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.451
Hey, mom.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.871
Did you know that this mall
has the largest selection

40:56.954 --> 40:59.915
of cabbage patch kids
in all of Chicago?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.710
I didn't know that, no.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.254
Which is good,
'cause they're really
flying off the shelves.

41:09.175 --> 41:12.261
He doesn't want
a cabbage patch kid
now, does he?

41:12.344 --> 41:14.221
- No idea.
- Odd. But who knows
with these two?

41:14.305 --> 41:16.473
- Hey! What're you doing?
- [Horn blaring]

41:16.557 --> 41:18.684
Yeah, Wisconsin plates.
Shocker.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.912
-Look at him. Look at him.
Look at him.
-Okay. All right, John...

41:20.936 --> 41:22.813
He's jerking the wheel
like he's milking a cow.

41:24.648 --> 41:28.611
[Adult Jake] Ah, yes.
The annual Doyle
Chicago shopping trip.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.237
Also known
as my dad's least favorite

41:30.321 --> 41:31.947
and most expensive day
of the year.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.574
You know what I love
when you wear?

41:33.657 --> 41:35.159
- What?
- Turtlenecks.

41:35.242 --> 41:36.952
Ah.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.805
It's gonna be so cold
in Minnesota when we get
to my parents' house,

41:38.829 --> 41:40.956
I feel like we should
definitely try on a few today.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.585
Yeah, well, turtlenecks,
your parents, it's great.

41:44.668 --> 41:45.586
So, yes?

41:45.669 --> 41:46.754
Look at this idiot.

41:46.837 --> 41:47.922
What're you doing?

41:48.005 --> 41:50.299
Hey! You beeping at me?

41:50.382 --> 41:51.382

41:51.425 --> 41:52.885
Yeah, I got a horn, too, miles.

41:52.968 --> 41:54.595
Miles Davis,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.263
Sorry.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.848
Can we turn on
the Christmas Carols?

41:57.932 --> 42:00.226
No! No Christmas Carols.

42:00.309 --> 42:03.979
Steely Dan. Listen to this.
This is good stuff.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.035
[Jake] Hey, mom.
Did you know

43:00.119 --> 43:03.497
that cabbage patch kids
come with their own
birth certificates?

43:03.580 --> 43:05.392
Thought all you cared about
was selling wreaths.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.835
Since when are you
so interested
in cabbage patch kids?

43:07.918 --> 43:09.670
Lizzy really wants one.

43:09.753 --> 43:12.464
Well, they're very expensive,
honey, and they're very hard
to find.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.564

Last patch in all of Chicago.

You should've seen it.
It was ugly.

right in the throat.

You know, I saw some
really nice care bears
on the way in.

wanna go over there
and wipe her tears

[Nintendo] You know who.

44:03.390 --> 44:04.516
Nintendo?

44:04.600 --> 44:06.894
[Nintendo] That's right.
Come over here.

44:06.977 --> 44:08.562
I've missed you, Jake.

44:08.645 --> 44:10.665
[Kathy] Hey, Jake.
Your dad and I
are gonna go upstairs

44:10.689 --> 44:12.191
to get the fenelons a gift.

44:12.274 --> 44:15.361
[John] Why?
They haven't given us anything.

44:15.444 --> 44:18.280
[Kathy] Stay down here
with the toys and watch
your sister, okay?

44:19.198 --> 44:20.282

44:21.617 --> 44:23.077
- Jake.
- Huh?

44:23.160 --> 44:24.453
Watch your sister.

44:25.245 --> 44:26.705
Yeah.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.208
[Nintendo] That's it.
Come over here, Jake.

What am I gonna do about
my cabbage patch kid now, Jake?

44:34.338 --> 44:36.715
[Nintendo]
Forget your sister, Jake.
She's useless.

44:36.799 --> 44:38.759
You should be worried
about the wreaths.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.552
Have you sold enough wreaths?

44:40.636 --> 44:42.179
I'll do anything to be with you.

how many games
I have here, Jake?

44:50.813 --> 44:52.856
I have all the games.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.775
Way more than Timmy keane.

44:54.858 --> 44:56.944
What game
would you like to play?

44:57.027 --> 44:58.195
Joust.

44:58.278 --> 45:00.155
Pick another one.
I don't have that one.

45:00.239 --> 45:01.615
[Jake] Super Mario bros.

45:01.698 --> 45:03.409
- Pick another one.
- Defender.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.869
Hmm, how about rampage?

45:05.953 --> 45:07.162
It's loaded up right now.

45:07.246 --> 45:09.790
Cool. I'll do anything you say.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.386
[Nintendo]
Very good. Yes.

45:22.469 --> 45:23.929
You're such a good boy, Jake.

45:24.012 --> 45:26.640
I can tell,
you've got what it takes.

45:26.723 --> 45:27.766
You really think so?

45:27.850 --> 45:29.726
[Nintendo] No. I know so.

45:32.062 --> 45:34.040
[Adult Jake] Maybe it was
the excitement of the display,

45:34.064 --> 45:36.108
or just the thrill of playing
in public,

45:36.191 --> 45:40.070
but for some reason,
I started playing
the game of my life.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.072
Dude, you're on fire.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.325
[Adult Jake]
All other distractions
became irrelevant.

45:45.409 --> 45:47.578
My senses had reached
a higher state.

45:47.661 --> 45:50.747
I'd become one with Nintendo.

45:54.751 --> 45:57.171
Yeah!

45:57.254 --> 46:00.340
[Nintendo] Yes, yes.
You were born for this moment.

46:03.010 --> 46:05.387
Whoa!
You're amazing!

46:05.471 --> 46:07.055
What's your name, man?

46:07.139 --> 46:10.017

the entire mall was
chanting my name.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.407
This was why I needed
a Nintendo.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.284
This was my destiny.

Shut up, Nintendo!
This is your fault!

that don't have chimneys?

[Adult Jake] The actual cost
of my retainer had been
explained to me

47:58.709 --> 48:01.461
in the simple terms of,
"if you lose it, don't bother
coming home."

50:09.715 --> 50:11.299
[John humming]

50:15.178 --> 50:17.806
- [Jake humming]
- Enough with the Dee-doos,
for crying out loud,

50:17.889 --> 50:19.099
I'm trying to listen to this.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.662
And stop fiddling
with the hand plane.

50:20.726 --> 50:21.977
This is not a toy. See?

50:22.769 --> 50:23.979
It's sharp.

50:25.313 --> 50:27.816
[Clanking]

50:27.899 --> 50:31.778
[Man on radio]
Konroyd over to larmer.
Larmer circling.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.739
And has his pocket picked
by Shane corson...

50:33.822 --> 50:34.990
You know...

50:35.073 --> 50:36.992
If you want, sometime,
maybe I can...

50:38.285 --> 50:40.662
Teach you how to use
some of those.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.831
I kinda got a lot going on, dad.

50:42.914 --> 50:45.500
Ah... right.

50:45.584 --> 50:48.336
[Man on radio]
He dishes back to larmer.
Larmer down the near side,

50:48.420 --> 50:49.463
over to savard...

50:49.546 --> 50:52.174
[Louder] He shoots, he scores!

50:52.257 --> 50:54.301
- Yes!
- Denis savard!

50:54.384 --> 50:56.386
- Hawks now leading with one!
- Yeah, baby!

50:56.470 --> 50:59.931
- [Exclaiming]
- And Claude lemieux
is still jawing away.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.683
Quit your crying, Claude.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.810
Yeah, you're all talk, no walk.

51:03.894 --> 51:05.479
Remember that, Jake. Okay?

51:05.562 --> 51:09.316
A bully like Claude lemieux
is not worth a hill of beans.

51:09.399 --> 51:11.318
He's all talk, no walk.

51:11.401 --> 51:13.361
Why are we under
this bridge, dad?

51:13.445 --> 51:15.822
Talk to a guy about
the cabbage patch kids.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.657
You know what
they look like, right?

51:17.741 --> 51:19.367
Why does lizzy get to get
what she wants,

51:19.451 --> 51:20.911
but I can't get what I want?

51:20.994 --> 51:22.370
Do you wanna deal
with your sister

51:22.454 --> 51:24.331
if she doesn't get
what she wants?

51:24.414 --> 51:25.707
- No.
- Exactly.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.001
I don't negotiate
with terrorists.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.669
So you just give them
what they want?

51:29.753 --> 51:31.546
- Yeah. You kidding?
- [Engine revving]

51:35.050 --> 51:37.052
Okay. That's him.

51:37.135 --> 51:39.679
Let me do
all the talking. Okay?

51:39.763 --> 51:41.389
This feels kinda scary, dad.

51:41.473 --> 51:43.683
Here, I'll take the handsaw.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.602
Come on. Come on!

51:50.982 --> 51:52.359
Can I help you boys?

51:52.442 --> 51:53.442
[John] Yeah.

51:54.319 --> 51:56.696
Word is that you've...

51:56.780 --> 51:58.323
Come into a little cabbage?

51:58.406 --> 52:00.242
Officer, please.
I'm just standing here.

52:00.325 --> 52:02.619
I thought maybe you two
needed directions, so...

52:02.702 --> 52:03.954
Relax, I'm not a cop.

52:04.037 --> 52:06.289
What about 21 jump street
over here?

52:06.373 --> 52:07.415
He's not a cop.

52:07.499 --> 52:08.708
Come on, man. He's 11.

52:08.792 --> 52:10.168
Yeah, I don't know that.

52:10.252 --> 52:12.295
I mean, cops are crazy.
You ever see robocop?

52:12.379 --> 52:14.381
That dude's half cop
and half robot.

52:14.464 --> 52:15.382
You ever see that movie?

52:15.465 --> 52:17.008
My mom wouldn't let me.

52:17.092 --> 52:18.760
But my friend,
Mikey trotter, saw it.

52:18.844 --> 52:19.761
Oh...

52:19.845 --> 52:21.721
Yeah. He's good.
You're good.

52:21.805 --> 52:23.765
He's not a cop, all right?
Now, come on.

52:23.849 --> 52:27.143
Are you gonna sell us
a black-market
cabbage patch kid, or what?

52:27.227 --> 52:29.020
Step into my office.

52:29.104 --> 52:30.904
You boys need anything else
while you're here?

52:30.981 --> 52:34.442
Some pound puppies?
Kidney? Nintendo?

52:34.526 --> 52:36.403
- [Jake gasping]
- [John] No, just the doll.

52:36.486 --> 52:38.446
We're gonna need a girl one.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.699
A redhead with freckles.

52:40.782 --> 52:42.826
Best patch in the tri-city.

52:44.911 --> 52:46.121
Yeah, that looks good.

52:46.204 --> 52:47.622
Yeah, does look good.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.417
So what, are you two
having a father-son day? Yeah?

52:50.500 --> 52:51.668
Something like that? Yeah?

52:51.751 --> 52:52.752
Need a third?

52:52.836 --> 52:53.920
Nah, I'm kidding.

52:54.004 --> 52:56.423
I do miss my dad... a lot.

52:56.506 --> 52:59.009
[John] Hey, this redhead
doesn't have any freckles.

52:59.092 --> 53:01.052
Yeah, no,
the blond one's got freckles.

53:02.137 --> 53:03.680
- All right, how much?
- $100.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.640
One hundred? No.

53:05.724 --> 53:07.017
Yeah, where else you gonna go?

53:07.100 --> 53:09.019
Every store from wheaton
to winnetka's out.

53:09.102 --> 53:10.854
Sixty bucks.

53:10.937 --> 53:13.899
I got the name of two brothers
up in villa park
selling them for $50.

53:13.982 --> 53:15.702
You know what?
We can go up there right now.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.111
Yeah, yeah. The Diaz brothers.
No, no, no.

53:18.194 --> 53:20.655
You do not want
any of their bald-headed junk.

53:20.739 --> 53:22.324
Seventy. Last offer.

53:24.159 --> 53:25.952
Oh, I can't say no to that face.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.245
All right. $70.

53:29.623 --> 53:31.225
- Comes with
a birth certificate.
- [Jake] Wow!

53:31.249 --> 53:33.460
- Dad, that's...
- Signed right on the derriere.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
[Dealer] Thanks.

53:38.381 --> 53:39.549
[John snickering]

53:39.633 --> 53:41.009
Can we ask about the Nintendo?

53:41.092 --> 53:43.386
I got him down from $100.
Can you believe that?

53:43.470 --> 53:45.221
[Chuckles]
Lizzy's gonna love it.

53:45.305 --> 53:47.074
[Adult Jake]
Did it bother me
that my dad went to

53:47.098 --> 53:49.309
herculean lengths
to get my sister a present?

53:49.392 --> 53:50.560
Sorta.

53:50.644 --> 53:53.188
But I was gonna get one
on my own.

53:53.271 --> 53:55.190
[Mr. Halberg] Gentlemen.

53:55.273 --> 53:58.526
Look deeply
into your candle's flame.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.446
Stare at its dancing light.

54:02.739 --> 54:05.450
Now, close your eyes.

54:06.701 --> 54:07.953
What do you see?

54:09.162 --> 54:12.415
You see the flame, gentlemen.

54:12.499 --> 54:14.334
It burns even when
your eyes are closed

54:14.417 --> 54:18.213
because we know that even when
we blow these candles out...

54:18.296 --> 54:22.050
The loyal ranger scout flame
will never fade.

54:22.133 --> 54:24.344
- [Kid farting]
- [Children giggling]

54:24.427 --> 54:25.595
[Mr. Halberg clears throat]

54:26.471 --> 54:27.639
[Sizzling]

54:30.100 --> 54:31.559
Okay.

54:31.643 --> 54:33.483
But I thought
loyal ranger scouts
were for boys.

54:33.561 --> 54:35.105
And scouts are supposed
to have honor,

54:35.188 --> 54:36.773
yet you're still here.

54:36.856 --> 54:38.084
[Mr. Halberg]
Lots to get through
tonight, gents.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.901
We've got the pinewood derby,

54:39.985 --> 54:41.695
the loyalty day parade... oh...

54:41.778 --> 54:45.532
I got another 'nam poem for you
entitled "a tie is not a loss."

54:45.615 --> 54:47.701
Get to the wreaths, halberg!

54:47.784 --> 54:50.495
- I'm sorry?
- The door necklaces.

54:50.578 --> 54:51.871
Are you even in this troop?

54:51.955 --> 54:56.710
[Chanting] Wreaths!
Wreaths! Wreaths!

54:56.793 --> 54:58.044
Wreaths! Wreaths! Wreaths!

54:59.879 --> 55:02.549
Okay. Okay!
We'll do the wreaths!

55:02.632 --> 55:05.260
[Children cheering]

55:05.343 --> 55:06.720
Okay. Calm down.

55:06.803 --> 55:08.388
Now...

55:08.471 --> 55:10.557
I know you've all been selling
very hard this year

55:10.640 --> 55:13.852
so we've done our best
to make sure
that these prizes...

55:13.935 --> 55:15.020
Are special.

55:16.813 --> 55:18.857
[Adult Jake] Oh-ho!
Look at that!

55:18.940 --> 55:22.277
First prize looked even bigger
than a normal nes system.

55:22.360 --> 55:25.989
Who knew what other
Nintendo treasures
were under there?

55:26.072 --> 55:28.241
Told you it came with
a free power pad.

55:29.617 --> 55:31.077
Okay. [Clears throat]

55:31.161 --> 55:33.747
In third place...

55:36.166 --> 55:37.751
Jeffery farmer!

55:37.834 --> 55:38.834
[Kids cheering]

55:38.877 --> 55:41.087
Nobody cares about third place.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.882
[Adult Jake]
Considering farmer's
constant claims to victory,

55:43.965 --> 55:45.967
this was a delight to us all.

55:46.051 --> 55:47.844
Anybody had a chance now.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.640
"Subscription to boys' life."

55:52.724 --> 55:54.434
- [Children laughing]
- Yes!

55:54.517 --> 55:55.769
I grew up on that magazine.

55:55.852 --> 55:57.645
[Mr. Halberg]
Great articles.

55:57.729 --> 55:59.731
And in second place...

56:00.732 --> 56:02.734
An amazing showing...

56:04.736 --> 56:05.945
Teddy Hodges!

56:06.029 --> 56:07.781
No!

56:07.864 --> 56:09.717
[Adult Jake]
Sadly, the combined totals
of the Hodges twins

56:09.741 --> 56:11.785
were only good enough
for silver.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.664
It's a globe of the whole world!

56:16.748 --> 56:17.791
All of it!

56:21.044 --> 56:22.962
[Clanging]

56:23.046 --> 56:25.526
[Adult Jake] There was
no second place when
it came to Nintendo.

56:27.801 --> 56:29.594
And now...

56:29.677 --> 56:32.347
- [Evan] This is it, this is it!
- This year's
first prize winner

56:32.430 --> 56:34.682
of the wreath-selling contest.

56:34.766 --> 56:39.270
The highest sales total
in troop history...

56:42.649 --> 56:44.192
Jake Doyle!

56:44.275 --> 56:45.443
[All cheering]

56:51.074 --> 56:52.492
I won!

56:52.575 --> 56:55.286
[Adult Jake] You can
put it on the board! Yes!

56:55.370 --> 56:56.996
Oh, so many people to thank.

56:57.080 --> 57:00.291
My friends, my family,
the Nintendo corporation...

57:00.375 --> 57:01.584
Yes!

57:01.668 --> 57:03.837
[Mr. Halberg]
This year's first prize...

57:03.920 --> 57:06.172
The best we've had in years...

57:07.590 --> 57:09.384
- Are you ready, Jake?
- Yeah.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.638
A brand-new set
of world book encyclopedias!

57:14.264 --> 57:15.807
What?

57:15.890 --> 57:18.059
[Adult Jake]
It was like winning
more school.

57:18.143 --> 57:20.103
No!

57:20.186 --> 57:23.523
Where is it?
[Screaming]

57:23.606 --> 57:26.609
- I hate you, halberg!
- [Mr. Halberg exclaiming] God.

57:29.404 --> 57:31.531
[Adult Jake]
It didn't make any sense. Why?

57:31.614 --> 57:35.243
Why had the troop leaders
promised us toys,
and then give us books?

57:35.326 --> 57:38.079
Who could possibly be
behind something so terrible?

57:38.163 --> 57:40.081
So awful, so villainous?

57:40.165 --> 57:44.419
Dr. Timothy keane senior,
that's who.

57:44.502 --> 57:47.672
Parents of batavia,
good evening.

57:47.755 --> 57:49.340
-Hi.
-[Adult Jake]
Little did we know,

57:49.424 --> 57:51.718
the night before
the wreath award ceremony,

57:51.801 --> 57:53.386
Dr. Keane had
assembled a meeting

57:53.469 --> 57:56.389
with the express purpose
of ruining our lives.

57:56.472 --> 57:59.475
There was an incident
in my home recently.

57:59.559 --> 58:03.271
A member of the keane family,
Lacy dog keane...

58:03.354 --> 58:07.066
Was crushed to near death
by our 42-inch television set.

58:07.150 --> 58:10.195
[Whispering] 42-inch,
that's a really nice
television set.

58:10.278 --> 58:11.571
[Whispering] John.

58:11.654 --> 58:15.074
Now I certainly do not blame
my boy, Timmy,

58:15.158 --> 58:17.952
who is a gifted,
generous young man,

58:18.036 --> 58:22.665
who has recently been diagnosed
with something called...

58:22.749 --> 58:24.417
"Attention deficit..."

58:24.500 --> 58:25.919
Blah, blah, blah. Whatever.

58:26.002 --> 58:29.255
It's very serious...
[Sighs]

58:29.339 --> 58:31.716
And it's extremely rare.

58:31.799 --> 58:33.009
[Crying] So rare.

58:33.092 --> 58:34.302
[Kisses and blows]

58:34.385 --> 58:35.845
[Kisses] I love you.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.198
Could I have the lights, please?

58:37.222 --> 58:38.222
[Clicking]

58:40.683 --> 58:42.101
Ladies and gentlemen...

58:42.185 --> 58:45.271
The real culprit of
this dog-crippling crime...

58:45.355 --> 58:46.981
Is video games.

58:47.065 --> 58:49.651
Video games did this.

58:49.734 --> 58:51.128
- [Crowd gasping]
- [Mrs. Keane whimpers]

58:51.152 --> 58:52.612
And this.

58:52.695 --> 58:53.780
[Crowd gasping loudly]

58:54.364 --> 58:55.364
And this.

58:56.199 --> 58:57.283
[Gasping]

58:57.367 --> 58:58.952
And this.

59:00.703 --> 59:01.537
Oh.

59:01.621 --> 59:02.997
It's the same slide.

59:03.998 --> 59:07.126
I meant, and this.

59:07.210 --> 59:09.212
-[John]
Still same slide.
-God damn it!

59:11.005 --> 59:12.966
Timmy dumped
cheese in here again.

59:13.049 --> 59:15.677
You know you can't
give him cheese, Janice.
You know this.

59:15.760 --> 59:17.136
Pookie.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.180
[Sighs]

59:20.723 --> 59:22.016
And this.

59:22.100 --> 59:24.560
[Crowd exclaiming]

59:24.644 --> 59:26.455
- The question is,
ladies and gentlemen...
- [Mrs. Keane crying]

59:26.479 --> 59:27.772
[Man] Is that a dog?

59:27.855 --> 59:29.208
What are we prepared
to do about it?

59:29.232 --> 59:30.316
We should ban it!

59:30.400 --> 59:32.193
- Ban it!
- Ban it! Ban it!

59:32.277 --> 59:35.154
- No more dogs
are getting crushed in my town!
- No more.

59:35.238 --> 59:36.990
- We must protect our dogs.
- Yes.

59:37.073 --> 59:39.450
We must protect our community!

59:39.534 --> 59:41.160
Yes!

59:41.244 --> 59:43.222
[Mr. Keane]
It's modern technology
taking over our lives.

59:43.246 --> 59:45.391
It's only gonna get worse.
It's all gonna go
downhill from here!

59:45.415 --> 59:47.017
- [Mrs. Trotter] That's right.
- We've gotta stop it!

59:47.041 --> 59:48.852
We've gotta burn it all,
burn it all to the ground.

59:48.876 --> 59:50.169
- Burn it.
- Yeah.

59:50.253 --> 59:52.922
Video game over!
Video game over!

59:53.006 --> 59:54.924
Let me hear you.
Video game over! Louder.

59:55.008 --> 59:58.011
[All chanting] Video game over!
Video game over!

59:58.094 --> 59:59.571
- Let me hear you.
- [Chanting continues]

59:59.595 --> 01:00:01.315
[Softly] Bring it down now.
Video game over.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:03.516
[Adult Jake] Keane's panicked
propaganda continued on

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:04.892
well into the night.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:07.437
It was a virtual
video game armageddon.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.873
-[Mr. Halberg]
I can feel it! We're so close!
-[Crowd] Video game over!

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.691
Video game over!

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.794
[Adult Jake]
And there was nothing
we could do about it.

01:00:13.818 --> 01:00:14.986
[Bugs bunny on TV]
No rabbit.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:21.534
All those wreaths for nothing.

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:25.413
Did you know that
Australia's chief export
is coal briquettes?

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.333
[Sighs]

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:31.437
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special
news bulletin from Kane county.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:33.338
Thank you, Walter.
We're here live in Geneva

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:36.591
with video game
violence activist
Dr. Timothy keane.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:39.218
Dr. Keane, it's only
eight shopping days now

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.054
until Christmas,
and you've managed to pass

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:44.807
a county-wide ban
on selling video game systems.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.476
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.603
Every store in Kane county
has agreed to it.

01:00:48.686 --> 01:00:52.357
And you really feel that
video games promote
violence enough

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.233
to make them illegal?

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.128
Has your dog ever been
crushed to near death
by your TV?

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.071
No, she has not.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:00.007
[Dr. Keane on TV]
It's not a pretty sight.
Parents need to know the truth.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:04.243
These games are pure evil,
and they've got to be stopped.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.038
Video game over!
Video game over!

01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:08.974
-Video game over!
-[Crowd chanting on TV]
Video game over!

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.500
He's a podiatrist.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.168
Sorry, Jake.

01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:13.753
Knock it off, lizzy.

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:17.048
No, I was being serious.
I know how much you wanted one.

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:19.759
I had it.

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:21.594
It was mine.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.347
But now...

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.225
I'll never get one.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.437
Here. You can have the remote.

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:35.024
Thanks, lizzy.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.740
She gave you the remote?

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:45.993
I would never give Charlie
the remote.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:47.620
You must've been a wreck.

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:50.331
Duh. They banned Nintendo.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.126
So, if batavia banned Nintendo

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.586
and grandma and grandpa
won't get you one...

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.172
And you're doing
all these bad things,
all the time...

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:00.967
- Not all the time.
- Yes, all the time.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.490
You're doing all these things,
and no one will get it for you,

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.887
then how did you get it?

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.681
How did you get the Nintendo?

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:09.225
Okay, calm down.

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:11.036
Should we take a break?
You wanna text Maeve...

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.228
No!

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:14.355
I wanna know
what happens in the story.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.439
[Sighs]

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.818
You see, Annie...

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.320
Sometimes during Christmas...

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.157
Just when you think that
all hope is lost...

01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:26.993
Something magical happens.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:31.664
Some people call it
a Christmas miracle.

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:35.126
Well, this miracle happened
at the roller rink.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:37.879
What's a roller rink?

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:39.921
[Sighs]

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:47.847
[Adult Jake]
Six days until Christmas
and it was officially official.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.391
None of us were getting
a Nintendo.

01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:58.399
[Evan] My cousin in elmhurst
might get one still.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:00.151
That's in cook county.

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:01.402
Dupage county.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.446
- How do you know?
- I got encyclopedias.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:05.531
[Jeff] Come on, guys.
We still got each other.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.824
- [Boy] Watch out!
- [Gasps]

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.493
[Glass breaking]

01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:11.329
- [Jeff] Sorry.
- Objectively,
I know that's hilarious

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:15.124
but I just don't have it in me
to laugh right now.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.710
[Adult Jake] It was
the Hodges' birthday party.

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.587
The dreaded Christmas birthday.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:22.507
Not only did the twins have to
share a birthday between them,

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.009
they had to share it
with Christmas to boot.

01:03:25.092 --> 01:03:28.888
"Happy birthday
and merry Christmas.
Love, grandma."

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.181
What a rip-off.

01:03:30.264 --> 01:03:33.017
"P.s. This gift
is for you two to share."

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:37.104
-Fresh packs.
Who wants to open?
-[All] Me!

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:41.609
- You got Chris sabo.
- Need it.

01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:44.654
Need it. Got it.
Need it.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:45.947
You gonna eat your gum?

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:49.699
Ow!

01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:51.494
Mmm...

01:03:51.577 --> 01:03:54.038
Uh, I got a ripken.
Billy ripken.

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:55.957
[Tammy] Who cares about
Billy ripken?

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.041
[Chuckles in disbelief]

01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:58.209
What?

01:03:58.292 --> 01:03:59.460
What? What is it?

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:00.944
You guys are not gonna
believe this.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.089
Look! Right there! On his bat!

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.550
- [Jake] Oh, my gosh!
- [Evan] A swear word.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.718
That's a bad one.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.488
- What does it say?
- [Evan] Don't read it out loud.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.347
I'm not allowed
to hear swear words.

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.224
"Swear word dash face."

01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:15.268
Which swear word? A-face?

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:16.143
Mmm-mmm.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:18.229
- S-face?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:20.481
Wait. F-Face?

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:21.315
Bingo.

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:22.650
It's an error card.

01:04:22.733 --> 01:04:25.444
It's the greatest error card
of all time!

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.904
Billy ripken.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.700
Ninety-five bucks!

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:32.034
[Cheering]

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.995
Ninety-five dollars?
You're a millionaire!

01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:36.872
Yeah, couple more of those,
and you can buy
your own Nintendo.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.209
Guys...

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.795
I got it.

01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:44.046
[Jeff] I don't get it.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.357
[Jake] What do you mean,
you don't get it?

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.091
It's a very clear 15-point plan.

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:50.094
- I think you spelled
"covert" wrong.
- [Mikey] Okay.

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:53.806
The field trip is Monday
at 0900 hours to Chicago.

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:56.934
- So?
- So, they still sell
nintendos there.

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.102
So?

01:04:58.185 --> 01:04:59.937
So, we sell some baseball cards,

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:01.480
get some money...

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.667
We sneak out of the field trip
and buy our own Nintendo.

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.485
Oh, now I get it. But wait,
how's that 15 steps?

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.571
That's like... three.

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.323
I don't know.
We could get in trouble.

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:13.367
I can't get in trouble now.
It's almost Christmas.

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:14.827
Forget Christmas.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.705
This is bigger than Christmas.

01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:23.044
[Jake] This is our
one and only chance
to get a Nintendo.

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.463
One that we can play on our own.

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:27.840
We don't have to worry about
taking our boots off,

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.258
or getting in line...

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.218
Or any of that stuff.

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:33.346
We can totally do this!

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:38.017
- This is our Vietnam.
- [Mikey] Yeah.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.020
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:43.397
I have no idea what it means.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:45.024
But who's with me?

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.107
I'm in.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:53.699
Check, check. Over.

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:55.660
[Both] We're in.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.636
I'm in.

01:06:13.719 --> 01:06:15.096
Nope.

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:16.305
- [Tammy] Forget it.
- What?

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:17.765
Baseball cards, farmer.

01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:20.101
Come on!
What's a guy gotta do?

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:21.894
Olsen?

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:34.824
[Sighs]

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.661
We're gonna
get in so much trouble.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:39.870
[All cheering]

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.167
[All] One, two, three, Nintendo!

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:51.340
[All cheering]

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:52.508
[Jake] Got it!

01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:53.592
Nice, Tammy.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.219
[Evan] Safe and secure.

01:06:55.302 --> 01:06:56.804
Here we go!

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:25.791
[Annie] Oh, no!
Not jagorski.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.251
What's he gonna do?

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:28.961
I'll give you a hint.

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:30.796
Nothing good.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.632
[Mrs. Hugo]
It's my favorite field trip.
Off to the art institute.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.301
- Duffle bag?
- Check.

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.094
- Blanket?
- Check. In the bag.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.471
- Walkie-talkies?
- Check.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:39.889
Camouflage, check.

01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:42.349
Not necessary, farmer.
But I like the spirit.

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:44.351
Personally, I prefer
a woodland pattern,

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:45.895
you know, for urban combat.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:47.480
[Jeff] I agree.

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:48.814
How are you feeling, Olsen?

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.608
Not good. [Gags]

01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:51.691
Perfect.

01:07:54.111 --> 01:07:56.322
Nice trapper keeper, Doyle.

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.491
I heard it's good
for money management.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:01.160
[Jake struggling]

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.745
[Josh growls]

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:04.538
- That's ours!
- Not anymore.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:06.123
You can't do that!

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:09.001
Oh, yeah?
And what are you
gonna do about it?

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:11.629
Yeah. That's what I thought.

01:08:11.712 --> 01:08:14.131
Your Nintendo's mine.
[Grunts]

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:16.091
[Laughs wickedly]

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:17.259
[Josh] What up, miss Hugo?

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:18.551
Oh, man. This is so bad.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.513
I don't think it could get
any worse.

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:22.555
Jake Doyle.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.933
Where do you think you're going?

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:25.600
On the bus to the art institute?

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:26.894
Not like that.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.729
No boots, no field trip.

01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:37.029
[Adult Jake]
At first, I thought,
"maybe no one will notice."

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:41.116

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.369
Oh, god.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.121
I got past them,
I'm in the clear!

01:17:06.204 --> 01:17:08.040
[Mikey over comms]
The bus is moving, Jake.

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:10.143
The stoplight is still
the rendezvous.
You're gonna make it.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.668
[Adult Jake]
This was it. This was it.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.379
Victory was mine.
I could taste it.

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:16.465
Yes. Yes.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.383
No!

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:28.222
[Slow motion screaming] No!

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:31.730
[All] No!

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:44.201
That can't be good.

01:17:47.704 --> 01:17:49.498
- [Thumps]
- Damn.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:55.629
So, you're not gonna get
what you wanted for Christmas.

01:17:55.712 --> 01:17:58.757
Ain't gonna lie.
That's a tough one, kid.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.093
You could give me the Nintendo
you have in your trunk.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:04.221
I said you're not gonna get
what you wanted
for Christmas this year.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:07.099
One year, for Christmas,
when I was a kid,

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.434
know what I wanted?
I wanted a donkey.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.853
A donkey. Can you believe that?

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.940
Yeah. Be kind of a weird thing
to make up.

01:18:15.732 --> 01:18:17.275
Well, I did.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:20.445
All November, all December,
that's all I could think about.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.197
All I could talk about.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.033
Donkey this, donkey that.
How am I gonna get this donkey?

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.328
And guess what happened
Christmas morning?

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:30.789
- You got a donkey?
- No.

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.165
Who gets a donkey?

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:33.667
No. I...

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:37.462
No. I realized that I spent
the whole Christmas season

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.464
worrying about
something I wanted

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:42.843
and I stopped appreciating
what I already had.

01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:45.095
Was it like a hamster
or dog or something?

01:18:45.178 --> 01:18:48.515
No, my family. My life.

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:50.809
You know, you only get
so many christmases, kid.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.978
You gotta make them count.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:57.065
Hey, I bet you haven't even
told somebody "merry Christmas"
this year, have you?

01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:03.572
All right, come on, get up.
I'll get you a cab. Come on.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:05.740
Yo! Taxi!

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:13.290
Let's get you back
with your field trip.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.878
- Where's you headed?
- Art institute.

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:20.464
Drop him off
at the side door on Monroe.

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.090
- Okay?
- Got it.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:24.134
Tell security you got lost.

01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.803
Is there any way
I can pay you back somehow?

01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:29.389
Nah. I fleeced your dad
for that patch.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:30.741
You gotta do me a favor, though.

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.851
- What's that?
- Have a merry Christmas.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.067
- [Christmas bells jingling]
- [Horse neighing]

01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:53.288
Wake up, wake up.
Is it time yet?

01:19:53.371 --> 01:19:54.623
Is it time yet, Jake?

01:19:57.918 --> 01:19:58.919
Let's go!

01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:00.002
[Festive music playing]

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:05.175
[Whispering] Wow!

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:10.096
[Adult Jake]
Ten years of visual
unwrapping experience

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.226
I could tell right away
there was no Nintendo
under that tree.

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:18.188
Fat ladies standing by
quietly warmed
their vocal chords.

01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:21.858
Lizzy, no opening the presents
until we pass them out.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:23.860
You know the rules.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:25.278
[Rattling]

01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:27.112
Legos?

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.698
Let's just get this over with.

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:30.951
Okay...

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.328
Let's have some Christmas.

01:20:35.455 --> 01:20:36.873
And...

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:40.293
- [John] Three, two, one...
- Merry Christmas!

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:43.004
It's Christmas morning, 1988.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.381
Opening our presents!

01:20:44.464 --> 01:20:47.050
- Looking good.
- Merry Christmas.

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:48.593
[Kathy] Merry Christmas.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.720
- Okay, hold on.
- Cheese.

01:20:53.056 --> 01:20:54.140
[Lizzy giggling]

01:20:54.224 --> 01:20:55.642
[Kathy] Boop. Boop.

01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:57.435
- [John] How are you, Jake?
- Boop.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:58.937
[John] Cheer up!

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.689
[Kathy] Merry Christmas.

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:01.856
[John] Thank you, honey.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.986
[John] Come on, buddy.
Thumbs up.

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:07.362
Great, all right, cool.

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:17.330
[Gasping] Leg warmers.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:23.253
[Exclaiming] What?
I got a sander.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.463
Bookends?

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.757
For your encyclopedia set.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:29.634
Great.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.678
And they have baseballs on them.

01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:32.761
I see that.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.683
A cabbage patch kid!

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:41.479
Wow! Freckles!

01:21:43.106 --> 01:21:45.233
I'm sorry it's not a redhead.

01:21:47.944 --> 01:21:50.780
Thank you so much.
I love you.

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:51.948
I love you, too.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:54.826
[Loud buzzing]

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.703
Another great Christmas.

01:21:56.786 --> 01:22:00.415
You know, every holiday that
I spend with you guys

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:02.500
is a real blessing.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.127
[Shouting] What?

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:07.047
I said, "every holiday that
I spend with you guys..."

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:08.632
John. John!

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.009
John.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.177
[Sander stopping]

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.553
Do you have to
do that right now?

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.514
Yeah, but... you gave it to me.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.184
Okay.

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:21.561
Never mind, honey. I feel like
the moment just passed.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.440
[Thudding]

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:28.026
-[Gasps]
-[Adult Jake]
And that's when I saw it.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.569
[Barks]

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:32.781
It was the exact size and shape
of the box I'd held in my hands

01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:34.157
not three days before.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:42.290
"To Jake. From uncle Dan."

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:45.919
Of course.
Crazy rich uncle Dan.

01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:49.297
Huh. A gift from uncle Dan.

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.901
You haven't gotten
as much as a postcard
in the last three years.

01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:53.885
Where's he living again now?

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.053
Japan.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.846
[Adult Jake]
Japan. Japan.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.306
Home of Nintendo.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:00.475
The land where dreams come true.

01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:02.811
Oh, god, don't mess with me now.

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:05.855
It's got your name on it, Jake.

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:09.192
[John] What'd he say
he was sending?

01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:10.485
I have no idea.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.157
Come on, come on.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.034
It has to be. It has to be.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:20.829
[Adult Jake] Lite-brite?

01:23:20.912 --> 01:23:21.913
Lite-brite?

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:23.289
Lite-brite.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.750
Japanese lite-brite.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.545
Wow! Lite-brite!

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:30.255
- Yeah.
- Jake, that's fun.

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:34.426
You know, for a second there,
I thought it was a Nintendo.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.052
[Laughs]

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:38.930
[Adult Jake] As I slowly tried
to grasp the situation

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:42.434
I began to fear that I might
never recover from this.

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:46.771
This was a tragedy so great
that I'd never go to prom,

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.774
never go to college,
never leave the house.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.528
I'd become
a 30-year-old balding man
in his parents' basement

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:57.532
making elaborate pictures
of Zelda on his lite-brite.

01:23:57.615 --> 01:24:00.285
Christmas was dead to me now.

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.745
- Hello?
- Hey, trotter.

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.371
- Hey.
- You didn't get one either?

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.166
- Nah, I got a chia pet.
- You got a chia pet?

01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:07.459
The Hodges struck out, too.

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:10.253
Yeah, yeah.
I heard about the Hodges.

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:13.715
They just got
a new bike... to share.

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:15.467
Yep.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:17.528
Farmer says he got one,
but he also says
he got a jetpack. So...

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.595
Yeah, right.

01:24:18.678 --> 01:24:20.805
I guess we all struck out.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:21.890
Well, I gotta go.

01:24:21.973 --> 01:24:23.016
- See ya.
- See ya, man.

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:24.099
[Line disconnects]

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.102
[Sighs]

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.857
[Annie] Wait a second.
So, you didn't get one?

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.901
None of your friends got one?

01:24:32.984 --> 01:24:35.111
What kind of a story is this?

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.322
Whose Nintendo
were we even playing?

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.451
Here, come with me.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.831
[Kathy] ...Gifts for
granny and grandpa
are in the blue bag.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.666
[Kathy speaking indistinctly]

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.754
We're going to Minnesota
for three days, Kathy.

01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:54.714
You've been in our car.
I've seen you in it.

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:56.132
You know how big it is.

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:58.218
John, you're getting
a little bit of a tone.

01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:00.345
I feel like maybe we should
leave tomorrow morning.

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.514
No. I'm not hitting traffic.

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:04.098
- Jake!
- What?

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:05.517
Oh.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.186
Hey, there's still a ton
of poop in the backyard. Okay?

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.188
So, get a shovel and pick it up.

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:12.190
Why? I mean, come on. Please?

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:13.525
It's Christmas.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:18.278
Fine.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:27.205
Come on. Pick them up
and put them down, buddy.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:29.249
- We gotta go.
- Yep.

01:25:29.332 --> 01:25:31.584
[John] Hey,
start with the ones
behind the shed.

01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:44.889
Dad! The floodlights!

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:50.019
[Adult Jake]
And there, high above
the frozen dog poo

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:52.188
that had become
the bane of my existence

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:56.609
was the most
beautiful structure
I had ever laid my eyes on.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:57.902
Whoa!

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.362
A tree fort.

01:25:59.445 --> 01:26:03.283
A spectacular,
solid-wood tree fort.

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:07.954
Oh, it was breathtaking.

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:21.217
Wow.

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.596
Wowee.

01:26:26.472 --> 01:26:28.308
It has a trapdoor!

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:33.104
Your dad was up all night
finishing it.

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:38.109
No, careful by the paint!

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:39.235
It still looks wet.

01:26:45.241 --> 01:26:48.036
Dad! It's awesome!

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.164
I'm gonna get the video camera.

01:26:51.956 --> 01:26:53.750
Nah, nah.

01:26:53.833 --> 01:26:55.376
- No?
- Nah.

01:26:56.794 --> 01:26:58.046
Let him be.

01:27:07.513 --> 01:27:08.513
[Sighs]

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:10.892
[Chuckles]

01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:12.644
So, dad...

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.813
The Nintendo was here
in the fort, right?

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.441
It was somewhere hidden in here?

01:27:18.524 --> 01:27:19.817
Nope.

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:21.319
Then how'd you get it?

01:27:21.402 --> 01:27:24.447
I never got it as a present.
I had to work for it.

01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:27.825
Spent a whole summer caddying
at prairie pines golf course.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:31.454
Then grandpa said
I could buy my own.

01:27:31.537 --> 01:27:35.500
But I'll tell you what,
this tree fort turned out to be
a pretty great present.

01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:38.336
Mmm-hmm.

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.630
It's my favorite place
at grandma and grandpa's.

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:42.590
Me, too.

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:47.011
[Kathy] Dinner's ready!
Come on in!

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:49.764
Grandma! Hi, grandma!

01:27:49.847 --> 01:27:52.100
Hey, mom!
Didn't know you guys were back.

01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:53.393
Well, we are.

01:27:53.476 --> 01:27:55.196
Now get your buns in here
and give me a hug.

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:19.459
Phew.

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.048
[Sniffing]

01:28:25.341 --> 01:28:26.759
Smell that?

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:28.261
[Inhaling deeply]

01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:29.470
Fresh air?

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:32.390
Fresh air.

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:35.059
Hockey stick slats
turned out okay, huh?

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:39.313
Thanks for your help.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:41.607
[Clicking]

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:44.027
Here. Carve your initial.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:47.030
Every good craftsman
leaves their Mark.

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.823
That's a good spot.

01:28:50.366 --> 01:28:51.367
There you go.

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.746
[John] There,
you got it. Yeah.

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.623
Not bad.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:29:02.128
Maybe this summer
we could add a lookout tower.

01:29:02.962 --> 01:29:05.590
Totally.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.262
[Adult Jake]
Peacefully, my mind unfolded
all the tree fort adventures

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:13.014
that undoubtedly lay ahead.

01:29:13.097 --> 01:29:15.767
Flashlight campouts
with Olsen and the Hodges

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.186
ridiculous ghost stories
from farmer

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:22.148
and late-night
skygazing with trotter
for Soviet spy planes.

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:27.528
And then a dog
was crushed by a TV.

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:30.448
Oh, and mom,
dad skipped out
on a field trip.

01:29:30.531 --> 01:29:32.450
It was the most crazy story
I've ever heard.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.494
Thank you.
Crazy and exciting and amazing.

01:29:34.577 --> 01:29:38.331
So, that was the first thing
you and grandpa
built together, right?

01:29:38.414 --> 01:29:40.083
Yes, Annie, but I had a point.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:41.959
I know your point, dad.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:44.045
I'm not getting a phone,

01:29:44.128 --> 01:29:45.963
but Christmas
can still be great.

01:29:46.839 --> 01:29:49.717
That... yeah, pretty much.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:51.427
But you left out the best part.

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:53.888
Yes. Our matching
purple floral boots.

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:56.307
Katie sorrentino, I would never.

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.975
- [Kathy] Okay.
- Really?

01:29:58.059 --> 01:30:01.771
Those boots were $11.99,
and I thought they
looked great.

01:30:01.854 --> 01:30:03.439
[Annie] No, dad.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:05.733
That was the Christmas
you and grandpa
found your thing.

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:18.037
Which is a miracle, too,
'cause that man
could not find anything.

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:19.163
[Both chuckle]

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:38.683
[Sighs]

01:30:41.144 --> 01:30:42.645
Thanks, kiddo.

01:30:42.728 --> 01:30:44.897
You think maybe
we could borrow
some of his tools

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:46.524
and work on the fort tomorrow?

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:49.152
Yeah.

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:51.821
I think he'd like that.

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:58.035
[Adult Jake] Turns out
John Doyle was more than
just a guy who yelled a lot

01:30:58.119 --> 01:31:00.413
and could never quite
finish the kitchen.

01:31:00.496 --> 01:31:02.165
He was a magician.

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:04.000
He was a hero.

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:07.336
He was my dad.

01:31:09.755 --> 01:31:11.257
Come on.

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:12.508
Gotta hit the road.

01:31:13.676 --> 01:31:15.261
Don't wanna hit any traffic.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:17.305
Okay.

01:31:20.349 --> 01:31:21.434
[Groans]

01:31:25.479 --> 01:31:26.522
All right.

01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:33.446
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah?

01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:37.158
Merry Christmas.

01:31:37.241 --> 01:31:38.951
Merry Christmas, Jake.
