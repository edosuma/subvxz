two, breaking out

03:55.476 --> 03:58.514
and raiding the bins.

03:58.548 --> 03:59.687
-Oh, mamma!

04:04.554 --> 04:07.074
-You're always saying how I
have to stay hidden from

04:07.108 --> 04:09.490
humans, and never give
in to our wolf-self.

04:09.525 --> 04:12.252
And the moment you've got a
chance, you're out of the

powerful the pull of the moon

-When you're old enough to take
wolf form, then you'll--

-I won't be a hypocrite who
says, stay hidden, and then

04:19.914 --> 04:23.366
breaks out at the first
whiff of food.

04:23.401 --> 04:25.575
And that chicken, blah.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.026
-Actually, your dad's not the
only one that's been eating

04:28.060 --> 04:31.167
things he shouldn't, is he?

04:31.201 --> 04:32.341
-Yes.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.688
And you were still dressed when
you came outside, young

-Yeah, didn't we agree in bed

what I found on

I'm going to compare it

-What?

Every type of dog?

05:20.837 --> 05:22.356
-This proof, Tom.

up there on the moors.

05:38.890 --> 05:41.030
-Finally!

05:41.064 --> 05:43.446
-You're gonna need a
bigger darkroom.

05:43.481 --> 05:44.792
-What?

05:44.827 --> 05:47.105
-Well, apparently the Incredible
Hulk is taking up

05:47.139 --> 05:51.178
photography, along with
Superman, and that is awful

05:51.212 --> 05:52.800

05:55.424 --> 05:57.633
-We're gonna get new members.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.532
-Look, I'm glad you
all have passions.

06:00.567 --> 06:05.088
But it does not entitle you to
a room on school premises to

06:05.123 --> 06:07.297
use as your own private den.

06:07.332 --> 06:10.024
You have until tomorrow morning
to find three new

06:10.059 --> 06:12.372

you down.

who did this--

06:22.554 --> 06:23.555

06:30.562 --> 06:34.152

bad handwriting.

-Welcome aboard.

07:09.739 --> 07:11.638
My name is Mr. Jeffries.

07:11.672 --> 07:14.468
I'm your head of year, as well
as your form tutor, so you

07:14.503 --> 07:17.989
will be seeing a lot of
me over the next year.

07:18.023 --> 07:19.300
Everyone!

07:19.335 --> 07:27.101
This is Rhydian Morris who, I
am guessing, is from Wales.

If I hear one more sheep noise
coming from the back of the

-No, here, on our territory.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.144
Don't you know the rules?

08:10.179 --> 08:11.318
You can't stay here.

08:11.352 --> 08:13.044
If my mom and dad get
a sniff of you.

08:13.078 --> 08:14.563
-I don't even know you.

-Exactly.

08:15.598 --> 08:17.186
-I don't care whose
territory this is.

I'm not sticking
around anyway.

08:18.428 --> 08:20.154
I mean, why would
I, in this dump?

08:20.189 --> 08:25.125
But no smelly girl tells
me when to stay or go.

08:25.159 --> 08:26.713
-Smelly!

08:26.747 --> 08:28.300
-Maddy, you did kind
of start it.

08:28.335 --> 08:29.094
-No I didn't.

08:29.129 --> 08:33.063
He was the one that was just--

08:33.097 --> 08:34.686
forget it.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.342
-As usual, you two
missed out on the

08:36.376 --> 08:39.311
most important question.

08:39.346 --> 08:40.623
Does he play football?

08:40.658 --> 08:43.177
-Is that all you ever
think about?

08:43.212 --> 08:44.558
-Basically, yeah.

08:44.593 --> 08:46.491
Hey, Jimi, you going to ask
the new kid to tryout?

08:46.526 --> 08:47.561
-Bleat boy?

08:47.596 --> 08:49.632
Don't think he's the right
sort for the team.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.978
Do you?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.950
-He didn't say you
couldn't ask.

08:56.984 --> 08:57.778
-Good point.

08:57.813 --> 08:58.572
-No, Tom, don't.

08:58.607 --> 09:01.057
-Come on, Mads, he won't bite.

09:01.092 --> 09:02.542
-I wouldn't count on that.

09:06.684 --> 09:07.650
-Wow, that's brilliant!

09:07.685 --> 09:08.306
You're really good, you know.

09:10.619 --> 09:12.828
-What do you want?

09:12.862 --> 09:14.657
-Just wanted to know if
you like football.

09:14.692 --> 09:16.072
-Not really.

09:16.107 --> 09:17.798
-Because, you know, it's a
good way to make friends.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.421
-I don't like football, and I
don't want to hang around with

09:20.456 --> 09:22.354
you and your weirdo mate.

09:22.389 --> 09:23.666
You got that?

09:25.426 --> 09:29.810
-Yeah, I got that.

09:29.845 --> 09:33.607
Obviously they don't teach
you manners in Wales.

09:33.642 --> 09:35.851
You didn't get to see the
picture, did you?

09:35.885 --> 09:37.956
It's a wolf's head.

09:37.991 --> 09:40.510
-Rhydian, look what we found.

09:40.545 --> 09:41.615
It's this competition.

09:41.650 --> 09:42.892
-We're definitely
going to enter.

09:42.927 --> 09:44.963
-And we think you should
too, because

09:44.998 --> 09:46.206
you're dead good looking.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.794
-All you need is a--

09:47.828 --> 09:49.174
what's it called?

09:49.209 --> 09:50.141
Phortolio.

09:50.175 --> 09:52.005
-She means a portfolio.

09:52.039 --> 09:53.282
-Ah.

09:53.316 --> 09:55.491
-Come on girls, he's not
interested in that.

09:55.525 --> 09:56.561
He's only just got here.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.943
What he needs is someone
to show him around.

09:58.977 --> 10:02.049
And we know everything
about it.

10:02.084 --> 10:05.605
-That weird girl, who's she?

10:05.639 --> 10:06.709
-Maddy Smith?

10:06.744 --> 10:07.952
Her?

10:07.986 --> 10:10.057
Those country families have
lived here for centuries.

10:10.092 --> 10:14.130
Never leave the area, don't like
strangers, or questions.

10:14.165 --> 10:16.477
-They're all cuckoo!

10:16.512 --> 10:18.272
-But what are we talking
about her, for?

10:18.307 --> 10:20.550
Let's talk about you, and me.

10:20.585 --> 10:21.655
-And us.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.731
-We need three new members
by tomorrow.

10:28.766 --> 10:29.939
What's going on today?

10:29.974 --> 10:32.666
Where could we recruit
new members?

10:32.701 --> 10:33.667
-[gasp]

10:33.702 --> 10:36.325
Miss Parrish's badger
stakeout.

10:36.359 --> 10:38.741
It's open to anyone,
but it's part of

10:38.776 --> 10:39.915
the year seven syllabus.

10:39.949 --> 10:43.643
So year sevens have to go.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.541
-Shannon, you're a genius.

10:45.575 --> 10:49.441
If we give out all the club
cameras, I bet we'll get three

10:49.476 --> 10:50.788
new members by tomorrow.

10:53.169 --> 10:54.239
[chuckling]

10:54.274 --> 10:55.378
-I thought I smelled
something funny.

10:55.413 --> 10:58.761
-Is that your lunch, Welshie?

10:58.796 --> 11:01.557
-I'm not even Welsh.

11:01.591 --> 11:02.696
-Ooh!

11:14.432 --> 11:18.229
-Got a problem, bleat boy?

11:18.263 --> 11:23.096
[growling]

11:23.130 --> 11:24.787
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]: What
on earth is going on here?

11:24.822 --> 11:25.408
-Come on!

11:25.443 --> 11:26.513
-Huh?

11:29.171 --> 11:29.999
-What are you doing?

11:30.034 --> 11:30.690
-It's all right.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.621
-Get out!

11:31.656 --> 11:34.107
-You have to get out!

11:34.141 --> 11:35.453
Argh!

11:35.487 --> 11:36.765
Ugh!

11:44.082 --> 11:46.050
I'm so sorry.

11:46.084 --> 11:47.603
[grunting]

11:58.545 --> 11:59.960
[wolf growling]

12:09.970 --> 12:16.666
[growling]

12:16.701 --> 12:17.978
-Rhydian!

12:23.018 --> 12:26.815
[growling]

12:57.915 --> 12:58.708
-He attacked me, sir.

12:58.743 --> 12:59.364
He's off his head.

12:59.399 --> 13:01.781
-And where is Rhydian?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.610
I'll catch up with him later.

13:03.644 --> 13:05.301
You follow me.

13:11.652 --> 13:14.103
-I knew there was something
about you.

13:14.138 --> 13:16.485
But when your eyes went--

13:16.519 --> 13:19.729
it's true, isn't it?

13:19.764 --> 13:21.939
You're like me.

13:21.973 --> 13:22.802
You're like me.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.596
-I'm not like you.

13:24.631 --> 13:28.566
I don't show off, and pick
fights, and invade other

13:28.600 --> 13:30.016
pack's territory.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.396
You're a danger to us all.

13:31.431 --> 13:33.122
And the sooner you leave,
the better.

13:46.032 --> 13:47.343
-What happened in here?

13:51.347 --> 13:52.486
-Let him go.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.077
He doesn't belong here.

14:15.268 --> 14:17.408
-I still think we should
tell someone, you know.

14:17.442 --> 14:19.997
-Yeah, tell Jeffries that the
darkroom's been trashed.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.619
See how quickly he closes
the club then.

14:21.653 --> 14:25.105
-Are you gonna buy
anything, or not?

14:25.140 --> 14:27.280
Pound.

14:27.314 --> 14:28.626
Thank you.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.148
-Are you's coming on the
badger walk too?

14:33.182 --> 14:34.390
-What's that?

14:34.425 --> 14:36.358
-Hey, Bernie, has
Rhydian come in?

14:36.392 --> 14:36.979
-Who?

14:37.014 --> 14:37.738
-He's this tall.

14:37.773 --> 14:38.636
-And dreamy.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.362
-And Welsh.

14:40.396 --> 14:42.157
-He's not Welsh.

14:42.191 --> 14:46.644
-Ah, the Vaughan's
new foster kid.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.956
-Rhydian's in foster care?

14:47.990 --> 14:49.578
-Oh, ay.

14:49.612 --> 14:51.821
Most have been a bad boy, eh?

14:51.856 --> 14:54.859
To get moved all the way up
here for a fresh start.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.240
-He's an orphan?

14:56.274 --> 14:58.035
-I told you, most foster kids
have parents somewhere.

14:58.069 --> 15:00.589
-Well, he's separated
from them.

15:00.623 --> 15:02.729
All alone in the world.

15:02.763 --> 15:04.455
Stuck in a strange place.

15:04.489 --> 15:06.319
No one to turn to.

15:06.353 --> 15:09.253
Trying to make it in the
world, all alone.

15:09.287 --> 15:11.738
-Keep recruiting, I'll meet
you in the woods.

15:11.772 --> 15:12.152
-But--

15:12.187 --> 15:13.119
-What?

15:17.192 --> 15:20.574
[sniffing]

15:23.612 --> 15:26.753
-This is where we have
to be very quiet.

15:26.787 --> 15:28.479
Badgers come out around
dusk and we don't

15:28.513 --> 15:30.722
want to scare them.

15:30.757 --> 15:33.449
-And photography really
impresses girls.

15:33.484 --> 15:36.280
-So you will join
up, wont' you?

15:36.314 --> 15:37.591
-Quiet.

15:37.626 --> 15:38.420
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]:
Do you want to join

15:38.454 --> 15:39.455
a photography club?

15:43.770 --> 15:44.978
-Rhydian!

15:45.013 --> 15:48.361
-Don't worry, I'm out of here.

15:48.395 --> 15:49.017
-Don't!

15:49.051 --> 15:51.467
I was stupid, I'm sorry.

15:51.502 --> 15:52.192
Don't go.

15:52.227 --> 15:52.986
We can help you.

15:53.021 --> 15:53.849
-Help?

15:53.883 --> 15:55.368
I've had help.

15:55.402 --> 15:56.438
Counseling, wrestling.

15:56.472 --> 15:57.818
-We can really help.

15:57.853 --> 15:59.544
You need to learn to control
your wolf-self before

15:59.579 --> 16:00.890
someone gets hurt.

16:00.925 --> 16:02.168
Probably you.

16:02.202 --> 16:03.686
-You're just like the
rest of them.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.233
-I know about the Vaughans.

16:33.268 --> 16:34.855
I know you're alone.

16:34.890 --> 16:35.891
-So?

16:35.925 --> 16:38.031
-I'm like you, you saw that.

16:38.066 --> 16:39.377
-You may be like me.

16:39.412 --> 16:41.034
You think the same as them.

16:41.069 --> 16:42.518
You're just trying to
make me better.

16:42.553 --> 16:43.968
But you know what?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.282
What I am, what I turn
into, that is better.

16:47.316 --> 16:48.628
It's better than anything
I've ever known.

16:48.662 --> 16:50.147
And I'm not letting anyone
take that away from me.

16:50.181 --> 16:52.183
-I'm not going to let you go.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.289
-Go ahead, chase me.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.704
Stop me.

16:55.738 --> 16:58.569
Use your wolfy powers and see
how long it takes for someone

16:58.603 --> 16:59.742
to find out what you are.

16:59.777 --> 17:00.812
Because none of your
mates know your

17:00.847 --> 17:04.022
little secret, do they?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.023
Thought not.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.164
I've got nothing to lose
here, unlike you.

17:21.488 --> 17:24.319
[sigh]

17:24.353 --> 17:25.458
-Oh, where's Maddy?

17:56.489 --> 17:58.007
[whistling]

18:00.872 --> 18:02.011
-Ha, ha, ha.

18:39.739 --> 18:42.086
-Sorry we're late, everyone.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.225
Seen any badgers yet?

18:45.848 --> 18:46.987
-No.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.162
You two have scared off every
animal for miles.

18:49.197 --> 18:50.370
I'm sorry, everyone.

18:50.405 --> 18:51.992
We'll have to come
back another day.

18:52.027 --> 18:52.924
-Come join a photography club.

18:52.959 --> 18:54.271
-Anyone?

19:01.657 --> 19:03.176
-Well done, Mads.

19:03.211 --> 19:04.660
-Yeah, we're were so close to
getting new members, and then

19:04.695 --> 19:05.903
you two had to show up and
mess everything up.

19:05.937 --> 19:06.904
-There was something important
I had to--

19:06.938 --> 19:07.974
-What?

19:08.008 --> 19:08.906
More important than the
Photography Club, yeah?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.287
-Yeah, actually.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.255
Rhydian is more important
than the club.

19:13.290 --> 19:20.952
The thing is, Rhydian
and I are related.

19:20.987 --> 19:22.161
Distant cousins.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.886
He's the black sheep of
the family, and I

19:23.921 --> 19:25.267
didn't want him here.

19:25.302 --> 19:28.236
So I treated him badly, which
is why he lashed out and

19:28.270 --> 19:29.754
trashed the darkroom.

19:29.789 --> 19:32.378
You don't have to be best
friends, but Rhydian's part of

19:32.412 --> 19:34.759
my life now.

19:34.794 --> 19:35.933
And that's that.

19:41.801 --> 19:43.458
-OK.

19:43.492 --> 19:45.149
Sure.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.495
-Welcome to Stoneybridge,
mate.

19:48.842 --> 19:50.430
You really don't like football?

19:50.465 --> 19:51.811
-No.

19:51.845 --> 19:52.432
-Right.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.331
well, I am frozen.

19:54.365 --> 19:56.056
So can we just go?

19:56.091 --> 19:57.265
-Yeah.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.612
-You might want to stay
here and warm up.

19:59.646 --> 20:01.234
It's a long walk
back to Wales.

20:01.269 --> 20:03.271
-I'm not even Wel--

20:03.305 --> 20:05.238
oh.

20:05.273 --> 20:06.722
-Here's to the late,
great Bradlington

20:06.757 --> 20:08.241
High Photography Club.

20:08.276 --> 20:10.554
It was full while
it lasted, yeah?

20:10.588 --> 20:11.175
-Mm.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.039
-Mm, mm.

20:13.073 --> 20:13.764
Yeah.

20:13.798 --> 20:16.870
[bells over door ringing]

20:16.905 --> 20:18.769
-We have a proposition
for you.

20:18.803 --> 20:20.943
-You've got a proposition
for us?

20:20.978 --> 20:22.462
-It's this competition.

20:22.497 --> 20:24.878
It'll cost too much to get our
photos done professionally.

20:24.913 --> 20:26.363
-And we need a phortolio.

20:26.397 --> 20:27.950
-Portfolio.

20:27.985 --> 20:29.538
-Both.

20:29.573 --> 20:33.508
-So if you take our photos,
we'll join your photography

20:33.542 --> 20:35.164
club, and everybody wins.

20:37.512 --> 20:38.823
-We're not actually
going anywhere

20:38.858 --> 20:40.273
near your monkey darkroom.

20:40.308 --> 20:44.381
We'll just put our names down
so Jeffries keeps it open.

20:44.415 --> 20:45.727
Do I have a deal?

20:52.837 --> 20:53.390
Please!

20:53.424 --> 20:55.599
-Ew!

20:55.633 --> 20:56.945
-Is Rhydian joining?

21:00.224 --> 21:01.294
-No.

21:06.092 --> 21:09.198
-Guys, I'll catch
you up, yeah?

21:09.233 --> 21:14.031
Rhydian, I'll walk
home with you.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.860
-I never said I was staying.

21:15.895 --> 21:17.103
-That's a pity.

21:17.137 --> 21:20.589
You got a fan club.

21:20.624 --> 21:22.281
-He's just scrummy.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.420
-He likes me.

21:23.454 --> 21:24.835
-He does not.

21:24.869 --> 21:27.251
-If that doesn't scare you
off, nothing will.

21:32.670 --> 21:39.919
So if you're not from Wales, how
did you get named Rhydian?

21:39.953 --> 21:42.922
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: My mom
was Welsh, I think.

21:45.373 --> 21:46.719
-How long you in foster care?

21:49.446 --> 21:52.241
-Since I was two.

21:52.276 --> 21:53.933
-And nobody knows
what you are?

21:58.489 --> 22:02.528
So what did you do for the
full moon last night?

22:02.562 --> 22:04.357
-I couldn't stay in my
bedroom, could I?

22:07.015 --> 22:09.845
I climbed out my window.

22:09.880 --> 22:13.746
-So it was your paw print
that Shannon found.

22:13.780 --> 22:17.163
Was it your first change?

22:17.197 --> 22:18.682
-Second.

22:18.716 --> 22:22.064
The first got me checked out
of my last foster home.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.653
-What happened?

22:24.688 --> 22:26.379
-Don't know.

22:26.414 --> 22:29.520
I went to bed and woke
up in a ditch.

22:29.555 --> 22:34.801
Turns out I trashed my bedroom
so they kicked me out.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.251
-It must have been hard.

22:38.598 --> 22:39.772
-Anyway, what about you?

22:39.806 --> 22:44.293
I mean, full moons must
be epic out here.

22:44.328 --> 22:49.160
-Well, I haven't started
transforming yet.

22:49.195 --> 22:51.439
-So I know more about this
stuff than you do?

22:51.473 --> 22:52.957
-Yeah, you're the expert.

22:52.992 --> 22:54.407
That's why you lost
it with Jimi in

22:54.442 --> 22:55.753
front of half the school.

22:57.790 --> 22:59.343
-I didn't know that
could happen.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.208
I only thought werewolves went
hairy at the full moon.

23:02.242 --> 23:04.659
-We feel the urge to change
when we feel threatened or

23:04.693 --> 23:05.970
angry, too.

23:06.005 --> 23:09.111
You learn to control it and you
can transform whenever you

23:09.146 --> 23:10.147
want.

23:10.181 --> 23:11.113
-How do you know
all this stuff?

23:11.148 --> 23:13.184
-My parents taught us.

23:13.219 --> 23:14.703
-You have parents like us?

23:14.738 --> 23:15.808
-Yep.

23:15.842 --> 23:18.638
And it's wolfblood,
not werewolf.

23:18.673 --> 23:19.984
We're not monsters.

23:21.814 --> 23:26.888
-The weird thing is I don't even
remember being bitten.

23:26.922 --> 23:28.165
[snickers]

23:28.199 --> 23:29.822
-Bitten?

23:29.856 --> 23:30.926
You don't get bitten.

23:30.961 --> 23:33.032
-Don't laugh at me.

23:33.066 --> 23:34.309
-Sorry.

23:34.343 --> 23:37.174
It's just you really do
have a lot to learn.

23:37.208 --> 23:41.385
-Well, teach me then,
smelly girl.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.145
-You were born this way.

23:43.180 --> 23:46.321
You're normal.

23:46.355 --> 23:47.529
[sigh]

23:47.564 --> 23:48.875
Look around.

23:50.636 --> 23:58.022
Everything you thought made you
a freak, sight, hearing,

23:58.057 --> 24:05.409
speed, sense of smell,
they're all

24:05.444 --> 24:07.031
completely normal for wolfblood.

24:12.692 --> 24:17.110
-So say I did stick
around, uh, only

24:17.145 --> 24:20.251
for a bit, no promises.

24:20.286 --> 24:22.081
-You'd have a pack, at last.

24:22.115 --> 24:23.496
People to teach you.

24:23.531 --> 24:24.497
-Oh, no.

24:24.532 --> 24:25.912
No rules, no lectures.

24:25.947 --> 24:28.536
You can keep your group hugs
and your big furry family.

24:28.570 --> 24:30.952
I'll do things my way.

24:30.986 --> 24:33.057
-Lone wolf, huh?

24:33.092 --> 24:36.785
So the next time you lose
control of your wolf-self,

24:36.820 --> 24:37.959
what happens then?

24:37.993 --> 24:41.997
-Well, uh, that'll be an
interesting day, won't it?
