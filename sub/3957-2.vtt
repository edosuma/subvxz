WEBVTT

00:02.868 --> 00:05.227
It's no wonder I went mental!

00:05.228 --> 00:07.267
I don't think I'm strong enough to
make it on my own.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.387
Why didn't you tell me
you were back?

00:09.388 --> 00:11.487
Come to the pub with me
and the gang.

00:11.511 --> 00:12.910
This is Rae.

00:12.911 --> 00:14.830
Hiya. I'm Archie.

00:14.831 --> 00:18.830
You don't want people thinking
you're weird or not normal.

00:23.551 --> 00:24.750
Dear Diary.

00:24.751 --> 00:26.670
It had been two days since the pool
party,

00:26.671 --> 00:30.670
and still Chloe
hadn't mentioned the hospital tag.

00:32.671 --> 00:36.670
Rae.

00:39.191 --> 00:43.190
'But I had a terrible feeling
that was all about to change.'

00:44.711 --> 00:47.470
Thanks for meeting, sweets.

00:47.471 --> 00:51.470
I just really need to talk to you
about something.

00:52.711 --> 00:54.510
I think I've got a boyfriend.

00:56.911 --> 00:59.230
I thought you wanted to talk about
something serious.

00:59.231 --> 01:01.790
Yeah, well, it is serious, Rae.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.347
Proper serious.

01:03.348 --> 01:05.467
It's not Archie, is it?

01:05.468 --> 01:07.667
No, it's not Archie. It's...

01:07.668 --> 01:10.507
someone who...

01:10.508 --> 01:12.667
Oh, look, I can't tell you, babe.

01:12.668 --> 01:14.427
Not yet.

01:14.428 --> 01:16.627
But I just wanted you to know,

01:16.628 --> 01:20.627
because you're my bessie
and I hate keeping secrets from you.

01:23.388 --> 01:24.667
Well, don't be like that.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.627
Like what?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.187
Rae, you will find a boyfriend.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.707
How?

01:29.708 --> 01:32.107
How will I ever find a boyfriend?

01:32.108 --> 01:35.587
Right, come here, sit down.

01:35.588 --> 01:37.467
Right...

01:37.468 --> 01:40.427
My sister used to be big.

01:40.428 --> 01:42.467
So, I know what this is like.

01:42.468 --> 01:45.707
And I know that boys don't like it.

01:45.708 --> 01:48.147
And it's not right, but...

01:48.148 --> 01:50.067
that's just the way they are.

01:50.068 --> 01:54.027
You know, they think, if they go out
with someone who's big,

01:54.028 --> 01:56.787
then the other lads
will just take the piss.

01:56.788 --> 01:59.707
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

01:59.708 --> 02:02.587
Yeah? Come here.

02:02.588 --> 02:06.587
Come on! Want a hug.

02:13.348 --> 02:15.427
I am a body dysmorphic

02:15.428 --> 02:18.227
without the dysmorphic.

02:18.228 --> 02:20.067
I am a bulimic...

02:20.068 --> 02:22.827
without the sick.

02:22.828 --> 02:24.907
I am fat.

04:11.026 --> 04:12.105
You all right, Finn?

04:12.106 --> 04:13.705
S'pose.

04:13.706 --> 04:17.584
I'm fine, by the way.

04:17.586 --> 04:18.745
Rae!

04:18.745 --> 04:22.745
'Oh, my God. Archie, the
tyrannosaurus of sexiness,

04:23.186 --> 04:25.425
'was coming to sit next to me.

04:25.426 --> 04:28.665
'I wanted him to treat me like that
little goat in Jurassic Park

04:28.666 --> 04:31.945
'and just eat me whole.'

04:31.946 --> 04:33.945
Save me from this conversation.
Please!

04:33.959 --> 04:35.198
Why?

04:35.199 --> 04:36.678
What's everyone talking about?

04:36.679 --> 04:38.598
Orgasms!

04:38.599 --> 04:41.278
That'd be my specialist subject
on Mastermind.

04:41.279 --> 04:42.718
I've never had an orgasm.

04:42.719 --> 04:44.998
It's exactly the same
as sneezing eight times.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.758
Is it bollocks!

04:46.759 --> 04:49.798
It's true. And when I come,
I come with thunder, pal.

04:49.799 --> 04:52.080
Once you get him out,
the SWAT team can't get him back in.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.918
Oh, aye?!

04:53.919 --> 04:55.558
What about the girls you're doing it
with?

04:55.559 --> 04:56.638
Ask Sam Moffat, mate.

04:56.639 --> 04:59.598
I threw her round that Renault 5
like she was an empty shell suit.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.958
Why d'you have to be such a horrible
boy all the time?

05:01.959 --> 05:03.678
What you doin'? Why? Why?

05:03.679 --> 05:05.958
Chill! Stop hitting me!

05:05.959 --> 05:07.398
It's not nice.

05:07.399 --> 05:09.358
Like, I'm not saying I've done
everything.

05:09.359 --> 05:11.278
Yeah, cheeky!
But, you know, like,

05:11.279 --> 05:13.118
an orgasm's like a gateway.

05:13.119 --> 05:17.118
You can never go back through.
Like, it sets you free as a person.
Doesn't it?

05:17.799 --> 05:19.758
Totally! Yeah!

05:24.759 --> 05:26.758
I've got an idea.

05:26.759 --> 05:28.958
Why don't we all talk about
our best sexual

05:28.959 --> 05:32.958
and romantic experiences?
Great! I'll go first. Listen...

05:33.079 --> 05:36.118
Er, no, Rae... Rae, you go first.

05:45.639 --> 05:48.958
I forgot, I've gotta put the tea
on for my mum. Sorry, guys.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.238
Come on, Rae.
Hey, I'll get you a drink.

05:51.239 --> 05:52.518
No, it's all right.

05:52.519 --> 05:56.518
Come on, you only just got
here. What you making?

05:57.039 --> 05:59.598
'Thanks to Chloe,
it was now clear to everyone

05:59.599 --> 06:03.598
'that I had never done anything
sexual or romantic.

06:05.119 --> 06:08.798
'The 15th of July, 1996.

06:08.799 --> 06:11.438
'Something had to be done.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.878
'One - pass through
the mystical orgasm gateway.

06:14.879 --> 06:17.798
'Two - see someone naked.

06:17.799 --> 06:19.958
'Three - kiss someone.

06:19.959 --> 06:23.958
'Must be human.'

06:50.279 --> 06:51.878
I didn't even see anything.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.118
She saw everything.

06:53.119 --> 06:56.238
Rae, did you see Mrs Dewhurst's...
credentials?

06:56.239 --> 06:57.798
She's always peeping.

06:57.799 --> 06:58.878
I didn't peep. You did.

06:58.879 --> 07:00.278
Were you staring at her? No!

07:00.279 --> 07:02.398
I opened the curtains,
and she was standing there...

07:02.399 --> 07:03.518
Oh, I beg your pardon... naked.

07:03.519 --> 07:04.838
I'm very sorry.

07:04.839 --> 07:07.358
You were. Fed up with it!

07:07.359 --> 07:11.358
Why would I peep?
What is there to even peep at?

07:11.519 --> 07:12.798
Rae, be quiet!

07:12.799 --> 07:13.838
'It was typical.

07:13.839 --> 07:17.478
'The first time I catch a glimpse
of another person's bits

07:17.479 --> 07:20.158
'and it's my 76-year-old
neighbour's.

07:20.159 --> 07:22.718
'A romantic milestone
burnt into my retinas.'

07:22.719 --> 07:24.398
Right.

07:24.399 --> 07:27.478
First off, Rae isn't gonna peep any
more.

07:27.479 --> 07:30.118
But I didn't peep! Just...!

07:33.199 --> 07:36.798
Second off,
she'll run a few errands for you

07:36.799 --> 07:40.798
to apologise for any embarrassment -
how's that?

07:47.399 --> 07:51.398
'Living in the totalitarian state of
Mum was worse than being in prison.

07:51.799 --> 07:54.758
'At least there are laws
to protect prisoners.

07:54.759 --> 07:58.758
'Any kind of human right I am
entitled to is always swept away
by one single phrase.'

08:00.839 --> 08:03.918
And don't pull that face at me,
Rachel Earl.

08:03.919 --> 08:07.918
So long as you live under my roof,
you live by my rules.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.478
My mum's in a sham relationship.

08:30.479 --> 08:32.158
She's going out with this guy.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.837
And he's like...

08:34.839 --> 08:36.998
handsome and fit and stuff.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.038
But she...

08:39.039 --> 08:42.318
she's like me.

08:42.318 --> 08:43.518
She's a blob.

08:43.519 --> 08:45.278
A blob with a gob.

08:45.279 --> 08:47.238
Is that how you see yourself?

08:47.239 --> 08:48.798
It's how I am.

08:48.799 --> 08:52.078
Tell me some things
that you like about yourself.

08:54.079 --> 08:56.878
Anything.

08:56.879 --> 08:59.278
I can't think of anything.

08:59.279 --> 09:02.438
All right, if I was to ask one of
your friends what they liked
about you,

09:02.439 --> 09:04.118
what do you think they would say?

09:04.119 --> 09:05.398
They would say...

09:05.399 --> 09:09.398
"What the bloody hell
are you asking me that for?"

09:11.359 --> 09:13.838
I've noticed that every time
you come into this room,

09:13.839 --> 09:17.118
you take the longer way round
to that chair.

09:17.119 --> 09:20.758
I thought maybe you're trying
to avoid that mirror over there.

09:20.759 --> 09:24.518
Ooh! Maybe you should open
a detective agency.

09:24.519 --> 09:27.758
Yeah, maybe I should.

09:27.759 --> 09:30.878
Hardly anyone likes
looking in a mirror.

09:30.879 --> 09:34.878
In fact, no-one likes
looking in a mirror.

09:35.119 --> 09:36.718
You know what, Rae?

09:36.719 --> 09:39.998
I'm 47 years old
and I still get blackheads.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.638
I've got bags under my eyes

09:41.639 --> 09:45.638
that make me look like I've battled
a lifelong addiction to heroin.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.958
But having said that,

09:47.959 --> 09:50.878
I do look fantastic.

09:50.879 --> 09:52.398
Yeah, I look great.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.238
You know what?

09:54.239 --> 09:56.438
Perfect wouldn't be a stretch too
far.

09:56.439 --> 10:00.438
I think I look perfect.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.158
Are you trying to make me hate you?

10:03.159 --> 10:06.598
I want you to make it your mission
to look in a mirror every day.

10:06.599 --> 10:08.958
And no matter how many things you
see that you don't like,

10:08.959 --> 10:11.238
I want you to say something positive
about yourself.

10:11.239 --> 10:15.238
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

10:16.559 --> 10:19.598
Do you know what? It's just weird.

10:19.599 --> 10:21.598
Is it more or less weird...

10:21.599 --> 10:24.198
than being physically unable
to look at your own reflection?

10:24.199 --> 10:25.358
I'm not doing it.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.678
All I'm asking is that you
try your...

10:27.679 --> 10:31.678
I'm not fucking doing it.

10:33.879 --> 10:35.918
What do you like about me?

10:35.919 --> 10:37.638
I like everything about you.

10:37.639 --> 10:38.918
Mmm.

10:38.919 --> 10:42.118
Be more specific.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.158
I can't.

10:43.159 --> 10:45.318
There's nothing I don't like about
you.

10:45.319 --> 10:48.558
You're lovely...

10:48.559 --> 10:50.478
but unhelpful.

10:50.479 --> 10:52.598
Tix!

10:52.599 --> 10:54.118
Danny.

10:54.119 --> 10:55.798
What?

10:55.799 --> 10:57.158
Danny, let go of her arm.

11:00.039 --> 11:03.478
Agh! Stop it. Agh! Tix, stop.

11:03.479 --> 11:04.518
Agh!

11:04.519 --> 11:07.478
Tix, stop it. Agh! Agh, Tix!

11:07.479 --> 11:09.078
Agh! Stop it. Sorry, Tix. Agh!

11:09.079 --> 11:13.078
Tix, I said I'm sorry, Tix.
I forgot. Tix, I'm sorry.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.838
No! No-one touch her.

11:15.839 --> 11:19.078
Danny, just let go of her arms.

11:19.079 --> 11:23.078
But she'll hit me again.
She won't. Just stop touching her.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.598
Tixy.

11:32.599 --> 11:36.598
'Broken people fall to bits
sometimes. That's what they do.

11:36.719 --> 11:38.158
'But I'm not broken.'

11:38.159 --> 11:39.638
It's all right.

11:39.639 --> 11:40.798
'Not any more.'

11:40.799 --> 11:44.000
It's all right. It's all right.

11:47.147 --> 11:50.546
Why did she look at me like that
when she gave me my prescription?

11:50.587 --> 11:53.546
Like, it's just the pill -
it's no big deal.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.986
I think she looks at everyone like
that.

11:55.987 --> 11:58.246
I once bought a whistling lollipop
from there, and she looked at me

11:58.257 --> 12:00.496
like I'd farted
in an empty bag of Monster Munch

12:00.497 --> 12:02.016
and just squashed it in her face.

12:02.017 --> 12:06.016
Nah, it's because it was
the pill. I know it.

12:06.177 --> 12:08.856
I can't believe
I'm gonna be doing it, Rae.

12:08.857 --> 12:10.576
This weekend!

12:10.577 --> 12:11.656
Shit!

12:11.657 --> 12:14.056
Shit.

12:14.057 --> 12:16.696
So, are we gonna talk
about the pool party?

12:16.697 --> 12:18.936
What about the pool party?

12:18.937 --> 12:22.296
Well, I found that
hospital tag thing.

12:22.297 --> 12:26.296
'I wished for the ground to
swallow me up, for a piano to
fall from the heavens

12:28.377 --> 12:30.536
'and crush Chloe deep
into the earth.

12:30.537 --> 12:34.536
'But the weird thing was, something
even more incredible happened.'

12:47.697 --> 12:49.896
- Ay, ay.
- Hi, Archie.

12:49.897 --> 12:53.896
Hi. Rae, I wanted to talk to you
at the boozer last night, but you
left before I could speak to you.

12:54.097 --> 12:55.896
I just, er, wanted to know

12:55.897 --> 12:58.976
if you wanted to come out for a
drink with me tomorrow night.

12:58.977 --> 13:00.056
Just me and you.

13:00.057 --> 13:02.576
'Wasn't expecting that!

13:02.577 --> 13:04.376
'What to say?'

13:04.377 --> 13:05.896
'Yeah? Fuck yeah?

13:05.897 --> 13:07.856
'A thousand fucks yeah?!'

13:07.857 --> 13:09.016
Is that a yes or a no?

13:09.017 --> 13:12.016
Yeah.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.576
Why not?

13:13.577 --> 13:15.696
Cool. All right, I'll... I'll meet
you at The Swan at eightish.

13:34.937 --> 13:37.416
When are you allowed back to the
ward?

13:37.417 --> 13:41.416
Kester says I have to
prove to him that I'm not gonna
freak out again.

13:42.657 --> 13:44.296
Let's talk about something else.

13:44.297 --> 13:46.336
So, tell me about Archie.

13:46.337 --> 13:48.496
Well...

13:48.497 --> 13:51.656
he's an Aries, which is perfect,
because I'm a Sagittarius.

13:51.657 --> 13:53.056
And he prefers Oasis to Blur,

13:53.057 --> 13:54.976
but he quite liked Parklife

13:54.977 --> 13:58.176
because it reminded him of this
holiday that he had in Corfu.

13:58.177 --> 14:00.456
And he wants to study history
at university,

14:00.457 --> 14:02.536
cos he wants to be, like, a
historian.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.816
And he's always coming out
with these amazing quotes

14:04.817 --> 14:07.136
from, like, Alexander the Great and
stuff.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.736
Tix, this could be it.

14:08.737 --> 14:12.736
This could be the real thing.

14:13.057 --> 14:17.056
I would be nervous about it, though.
Boys move pretty fast, don't they?

14:17.377 --> 14:18.736
He might want to touch you.

14:18.737 --> 14:19.776
Er...

14:19.777 --> 14:23.456
Tix, are you forgetting
that I really want him to?

14:23.457 --> 14:26.136
Well, yeah, but think about it.

14:26.137 --> 14:28.256
You could be naked
in front of each other tonight.

14:28.257 --> 14:30.176
You could be looking at him naked,

14:30.177 --> 14:31.736
thinking, "What do I do now?"

14:33.017 --> 14:36.456
"What do I do with... that?

14:36.457 --> 14:40.456
"What if I do something to it
that he doesn't like?"

14:40.577 --> 14:43.656
And that's not forgetting the fact
that you'll be naked.

14:43.657 --> 14:47.096
I would be bricking it, Rae.
Aren't you bricking it?

14:50.697 --> 14:54.096
Oh, my God!

14:54.097 --> 14:58.096
'Bollocks to looking in a mirror
and whispering sweet nothings to
myself.

14:58.177 --> 15:00.496
'If I wanted Archie to touch me,

15:00.497 --> 15:04.496
'it was imperative there was a lot
less of me to touch.'

15:10.257 --> 15:12.576
'Oh, Christ!

15:12.577 --> 15:16.456
'I'm the tyrannosaurus of sex.'

15:21.577 --> 15:22.576
Ahh!

15:24.537 --> 15:25.576
Clever girl!

15:25.577 --> 15:27.976
Ah! Ahh!

15:31.737 --> 15:34.696
'Something must be done.'

15:41.257 --> 15:45.256
'Only one album
would get my fat arse moving.

15:46.817 --> 15:50.816
'It was time for greatness.'

15:57.177 --> 16:01.176
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13...

16:03.417 --> 16:06.056
18, 19...

16:06.057 --> 16:10.056
21, 22, 23...

16:38.097 --> 16:39.576
Oi!

16:39.577 --> 16:41.736
Jabba the jogger!

16:41.737 --> 16:43.496
God! Jabba!

16:44.817 --> 16:46.216
Jabba the jogger!

16:46.217 --> 16:48.616
Oi, Jabba jogger!

16:58.457 --> 17:02.456
Bollocks.

17:10.297 --> 17:14.296
'Argh! How can I weigh more?'

17:17.656 --> 17:19.136
Mum?

17:19.137 --> 17:23.136
Sit down, Rachel.

17:23.297 --> 17:25.056
Stamford...

17:25.057 --> 17:27.656
is a small town, Rae.

17:27.656 --> 17:30.856
People talk.

17:30.857 --> 17:34.856
Have you got something
that you want to tell me?

17:35.257 --> 17:36.296
No.

17:36.297 --> 17:40.296
Not even in regards...

17:41.737 --> 17:44.376
this?

17:44.377 --> 17:47.536
That's for my mum.

17:47.537 --> 17:49.496
Not even in regards...

17:49.497 --> 17:53.456
these.

17:53.457 --> 17:56.976
Don't look at me! They're for my
mum.

17:56.977 --> 18:00.976
It's not even that
you're spreading rumours

18:01.337 --> 18:04.576
that I'm some kind of sex maniac.

18:04.577 --> 18:08.576
It's that to be a sex maniac,
you have to have a man.

18:09.937 --> 18:13.936
And as the man I've got is currently
on the run from Immigration,

18:16.017 --> 18:18.696
it's not something
I want spread around town.

18:18.697 --> 18:19.776
I, erm...

18:19.777 --> 18:21.576
It's not just those things.

18:21.577 --> 18:24.416
It's the fact...

18:24.417 --> 18:28.096
that I come home after a long day

18:28.097 --> 18:31.376
cleaning up the sick... and the piss

18:31.377 --> 18:35.376
of the infirmed and
injured, to find...

18:35.417 --> 18:38.456
that you have thrown away

18:38.457 --> 18:42.456
£35-worth of confectionery

18:42.577 --> 18:44.856
for no reason!

18:48.257 --> 18:49.336
I, er...

18:49.337 --> 18:51.416
Shush!

18:51.417 --> 18:54.056
I don't know what
game you're playing at,

18:54.057 --> 18:57.416
but you're grounded for 24 hours,

18:57.417 --> 18:59.416
effective immediately.

18:59.417 --> 19:01.296
I can't! I'm meeting some...

19:01.297 --> 19:05.296
Put... your keys... on... the table!

19:14.897 --> 19:18.416
'He's waiting for me. He's waiting
for me!

19:18.417 --> 19:21.336
'And some skinny bitch will see him
all alone at the bar,

19:21.337 --> 19:23.856
'dry his tears and shag him in the
toilets.

19:23.857 --> 19:27.856
'Arrgh!'

19:45.577 --> 19:48.376
All right, I'm coming!

19:48.377 --> 19:49.896
Archie?

19:49.897 --> 19:53.376
I'm wearing a towelling rainbow.
I look like a tube of toothpaste.

19:53.377 --> 19:54.696
Rae, what happened?

19:54.697 --> 19:58.016
I'm really sorry, Archie.
My mum wouldn't let me come out.

19:58.017 --> 19:59.296
Why?

19:59.297 --> 20:03.296
Cos I threw away
a few of her chocolate bars.

20:04.297 --> 20:07.536
Let's go out now. I won't tell her.

20:07.537 --> 20:09.056
I dunno.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.016
She knows everyone in Stamford.

20:11.017 --> 20:13.776
If we go to the pub, she'll only
find out.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.376
I know somewhere else we can go.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.376
All right. Wait here.

20:21.377 --> 20:22.376
Two minutes.

20:22.377 --> 20:25.736
- OK.
- All right.

20:25.737 --> 20:29.096
There aren't many good things about
working early shifts at a leisure
centre.

20:30.377 --> 20:31.496
Oh.

20:34.217 --> 20:35.256
But there are some.

21:06.497 --> 21:09.096
'Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't hear a
thing.

21:09.097 --> 21:11.776
'Just keep that pretty mouth
moving.'

21:11.777 --> 21:13.776
that was really
what put an end to the sport.

21:13.777 --> 21:16.136
If it hadn't have been for that,
maybe we'd have...

21:16.137 --> 21:18.776
jousting areas in leisure centres
all over Britain, eh?

21:18.777 --> 21:22.776
Yeah.

21:22.817 --> 21:24.216
Am I being boring again?

21:24.217 --> 21:26.216
No.

21:26.217 --> 21:30.216
I like listening to you talk about
stuff.

21:39.337 --> 21:42.256
'It was incredible
what Archie's tongue felt like -

21:42.257 --> 21:46.256
'like a small, warm animal
darting round inside my mouth.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.296
'In that one kiss, I was so free.

21:50.297 --> 21:53.256
'Free of people telling me what to
do.

21:53.257 --> 21:54.496
'Free of hospitals.'

21:56.017 --> 21:58.936
'Free of myself.'

22:00.777 --> 22:02.296
Archie.

22:02.297 --> 22:04.136
Your hand is on my boob?

22:04.137 --> 22:06.336
Does it feel good?

22:06.337 --> 22:10.336
Yeah, it's all right.

22:10.817 --> 22:11.936
Cool.

22:11.937 --> 22:15.936
Yeah.

22:21.537 --> 22:22.858
Will you be allowed out tomorrow?

22:23.817 --> 22:26.376
Yeah. I'm on parole tomorrow.

22:26.377 --> 22:30.376
Well, if you can, meet me tomorrow
evening for tea in the cafe outside
the cinema.

22:30.897 --> 22:34.896
Er, my parents
are away at the moment, so, er...

22:36.537 --> 22:40.536
Well... Afterwards,
maybe we could go back to mine.

22:46.417 --> 22:47.696
See ya.

23:05.566 --> 23:07.485
It was too good to be true.

23:07.486 --> 23:11.485
If it wasn't for the fact that
I found two new spots,
I'd think I was dreaming.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.214
Someone likes me.

23:15.215 --> 23:16.814
Not just someone.

23:17.024 --> 23:21.023
Archie, the professor of horn,
likes me.

23:21.184 --> 23:25.183
I don't get it, but I love, love,
love it!

23:40.344 --> 23:41.463
Rae!

23:41.464 --> 23:44.303
Oh, guess who I've just been
speaking to.

23:44.304 --> 23:46.263
Who? Mrs Dewhurst.

23:46.264 --> 23:50.163
Guess who she saw coming
in at one o'clock in the
morning with a boy last night.

23:50.198 --> 23:51.177
Who?

23:51.192 --> 23:53.771
I don't know when you thought
that going out with a boy

23:53.832 --> 23:56.031
and doing God knows what
till God knows when...

23:56.032 --> 23:59.911
Why is it all right for you to have
a boyfriend but not for me?

23:59.912 --> 24:02.391
I've gotta put up with Karim
every bloody day.

24:02.392 --> 24:04.671
Get in there.

24:04.672 --> 24:08.671
Get in.

24:09.032 --> 24:11.711
Right, what is wrong with Karim?

24:11.712 --> 24:14.511
He's constantly in a state
of semi-nudity.

24:14.512 --> 24:15.871
Why is he even here?

24:15.872 --> 24:17.991
Why's he going out with you?

24:17.992 --> 24:20.111
I just don't get it.

24:20.112 --> 24:22.711
There's nothing to get.
He loves me.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.671
Fair enough.

24:24.672 --> 24:28.231
D'you know what? I am sick to
the back teeth of you taking
the piss out of me.

24:28.232 --> 24:29.951
I'm your mum.

24:29.952 --> 24:33.951
Not your school friend,
not your sister. Your mum.

24:34.832 --> 24:38.231
Are we done? No, we're not done.
You're grounded.

24:38.232 --> 24:40.911
Not just for today.
Not just for tomorrow.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.111
But for forever, until I say stop.

24:43.112 --> 24:44.991
You can't do that.

24:44.992 --> 24:48.711
I can do that, cos this is my house
and you're living...

24:48.712 --> 24:52.711
Yeah, it might be your house and
I might live under your roof,

24:53.912 --> 24:56.271
but you're not grounding me.

24:56.272 --> 25:00.271
End of.

25:02.072 --> 25:05.111
Three weeks ago, Rae,

25:05.112 --> 25:08.991
you were in a psychiatric ward.

25:08.992 --> 25:12.151
It's my job to keep
an eye on you,

25:12.152 --> 25:15.351
to make sure you don't do too much,
too soon,

25:15.352 --> 25:19.351
to make sure you don't
break again.

25:20.712 --> 25:24.311
But d'you know what? Fine.

25:24.312 --> 25:27.671
You obviously know
better than me.

25:27.672 --> 25:29.111
Do what you want.

25:44.832 --> 25:47.231
Chop, you are talking
absolute bollocks.

25:47.232 --> 25:49.511
Orgasms are mint.

25:49.512 --> 25:50.631
A sneeze isn't even nice.

25:50.632 --> 25:53.111
How can eight of 'em be an
orgasm? It doesn't make sense.

25:53.112 --> 25:56.191
It's pound for pound.
It has the same physical impact.

25:56.192 --> 25:57.711
I read it in a textbook,
all right?

25:57.712 --> 25:59.471
So, just drop it.
Prove it.

25:59.472 --> 26:01.191
All right, I will do.
Go on.

26:01.192 --> 26:04.311
No, rack up a line of that pepper
and see if you can snort it. Go on.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.351
That one there? Aye.

26:05.352 --> 26:06.831
All right, I'll do it right now.
Get it right up your nose.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.671
Watch me go. Rae!

26:08.672 --> 26:11.711
I'll give you a fiver...
How was your date with Archie?

26:11.712 --> 26:13.151
Tell me everything!

26:14.352 --> 26:18.271
You didn't let him touch your lady
parts, did you, Raemundo?

26:18.272 --> 26:20.191
What are you doing?
No, nothing happened.

26:20.192 --> 26:23.591
I told you nothing'd happen.
Yeah... nothing happened.

26:23.592 --> 26:25.711
We did have a bit of a kiss,
though.

26:25.712 --> 26:27.071
Oh!

26:27.072 --> 26:30.551
Go on! You two are so perfect
for each other.

26:30.552 --> 26:33.191
Raemundo, you saucy little
tartlet, you!

26:33.192 --> 26:36.551
You little raring tiger!
Get out of it! Go on!

26:36.552 --> 26:39.431
Chop! It was only a kiss!

26:39.432 --> 26:40.911
Bollocks to that.

26:40.912 --> 26:43.791
Your faces totally had sex
with each other.Right.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.871
It was kinda cool.

26:45.872 --> 26:49.271
But... big deal. So we kissed.

26:49.272 --> 26:51.591
I can't believe
you're so chilled about it.

26:51.592 --> 26:53.791
Well, you know...
But, Izzy, it was so...

26:53.792 --> 26:56.991
Girls, I need to talk to you.

26:56.992 --> 26:58.191
Toilets.

26:58.192 --> 27:01.231
Now!

27:01.232 --> 27:03.031
Is that big enough, that?
Here y'are.

27:03.032 --> 27:05.031
That's big enough, that.
Have a bit more, mate. Go on.

27:05.032 --> 27:06.271
I had sex last night!

27:06.272 --> 27:08.591
Oh, yay! Oh, my God!

27:08.592 --> 27:10.351
What was it like?

27:10.352 --> 27:13.111
Who was it with?
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

27:13.112 --> 27:14.911
I still can't tell you who he is.
Yeah, yeah.

27:14.912 --> 27:16.071
It's just... Totally.

27:16.072 --> 27:19.431
You know, we just want
everything not to be in the
public domain at the moment.

27:19.432 --> 27:21.951
You know? Yeah.

27:21.952 --> 27:25.951
Oh, it was perfect. Got to
his house about half-eight-ish.

27:26.272 --> 27:29.031
He only lives
in a sodding barn conversion!

27:29.032 --> 27:30.871
Oh, my God!
I know!

27:30.872 --> 27:33.431
So, when I got there, we had,
like, a little bit of dinner.

27:33.432 --> 27:35.471
What did you eat?
Just a sandwich.

27:35.472 --> 27:36.711
He made you a sandwich? Yeah.

27:36.712 --> 27:38.991
Well, what kind of sandwich?
Well, cheese and Branston.

27:38.992 --> 27:40.471
Ohh... And anyway,

27:40.472 --> 27:42.791
he only goes and sticks on
the Phil Collins album.

27:42.792 --> 27:45.151
Oh!
Which Phil Collins album?

27:45.152 --> 27:47.191
Well, the one with Coming In
The Air Tonight on it. Obviously!

27:47.192 --> 27:48.471
Face Value? Yeah.

27:48.472 --> 27:50.271
Oh, yeah.
I think so.

27:50.272 --> 27:51.511
Doesn't matter anyway.

27:51.512 --> 27:55.471
Because we were only
halfway through the first song
when he took me upstairs.

27:55.472 --> 27:56.871
What was his bedroom like?

27:56.872 --> 27:58.591
Yeah, he was a bit weird
about taking me in there...

27:58.592 --> 28:00.191
so he laid me out

28:00.192 --> 28:02.951
on a towel on the landing...

28:02.952 --> 28:05.311
in front of the airing cupboard.

28:05.312 --> 28:06.711
And, well...

28:06.712 --> 28:08.751
you know the rest.

28:11.592 --> 28:13.071
Classic Chloe.

28:13.072 --> 28:14.351
Rae!

28:14.352 --> 28:15.791
Tell Chloe your news.

28:15.792 --> 28:19.351
Well, no, it's nothing
compared to...

28:19.352 --> 28:22.271
I kissed Archie last night.

28:22.272 --> 28:23.751
Oh, my God!

28:23.752 --> 28:24.951
How?

28:24.952 --> 28:27.711
Well, we just put
our faces together.

28:27.712 --> 28:29.031
Obviously!

28:29.032 --> 28:30.671
It turns out he proper fancies me.

28:30.672 --> 28:33.871
Ohhh!
You know what? Archie's really hot.

28:33.872 --> 28:35.351
Yeah. Correct.

28:35.352 --> 28:37.031
Yeah.

28:37.032 --> 28:39.751
So, what else happened?

28:39.752 --> 28:43.751
Well, there was a bit of touching
when we was kissin'!

28:44.272 --> 28:45.631
As standard, you know? Yeah!

28:45.632 --> 28:48.791
What else?

28:48.792 --> 28:50.191
He fingered me eight times.

28:50.192 --> 28:51.711
Yay! What?!

28:51.712 --> 28:52.791
Shit.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.471
Fucking hell, Rae.

28:54.472 --> 28:56.191
Yeah. Under your jeans?

28:56.192 --> 28:57.231
Over my jeans.

28:57.232 --> 28:59.111
Oh, that still counts.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.111
Totally still counts.
Oh, my God.

29:01.112 --> 29:02.831
Yeah! That's so good.

29:02.832 --> 29:05.591
And, er, well,
we're going on another date tonight.

29:05.592 --> 29:06.631
Really? Yeah.

29:06.632 --> 29:10.311
His parents are away, so, um,
I'm...

29:10.312 --> 29:12.351
probably gonna be doing it.

29:12.352 --> 29:16.351
Holy shit, Rae!
Are you ready for that?

29:17.672 --> 29:19.031
We should do a makeover!

29:19.032 --> 29:20.311
Definitely a makeover.

29:20.312 --> 29:22.831
Pleeease!
No, no, no, no. I don't do makeovers.

29:22.832 --> 29:24.351
That's not me. No.
Er, well, you do now.

29:24.352 --> 29:26.351
So, listen to me. OK?

29:26.352 --> 29:29.511
This is not just a kiss
and a bit of a grope.

29:29.512 --> 29:30.951
It's more than a grope.Exactly.

29:30.952 --> 29:32.311
So, think.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.071
Think, Rae. Think...

29:34.072 --> 29:35.991
of how hot Archie is.

29:35.992 --> 29:37.591
Yeah.
Right? Yeah.

29:37.592 --> 29:40.271
He's gonna be naked, trying
to put his penis inside of you.

29:40.272 --> 29:42.871
Yeah, inside.
Do you wanna look your best?

29:42.872 --> 29:44.791
Yeah!

29:44.792 --> 29:47.911
Oh, God.

29:47.912 --> 29:51.911
I never wanna have an orgasm
if it looks like that.

29:53.952 --> 29:56.071
Are you sure this is
even necessary?

29:56.072 --> 29:59.311
I mean, he kissed me...

29:59.312 --> 30:01.071
so he must like me.

30:01.072 --> 30:03.671
Yeah, but he's got to be
turned on by you, Rae.

30:03.672 --> 30:06.031
You know? Otherwise...

30:06.032 --> 30:08.671
Well...
Otherwise well what?

30:08.672 --> 30:12.671
Well, listen, sometimes men,
they can have problems,

30:13.272 --> 30:14.791
you know, being ready.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.511
Well, how often does that
happen? Well...

30:17.512 --> 30:19.271
if they don't like something

30:19.272 --> 30:21.591
or if they feel uncomfortable.

30:21.592 --> 30:25.591
So, please, will you hurry up
and try on the outfit,
cos I'm bored.

30:25.872 --> 30:27.711
All right. Chlo...

30:27.712 --> 30:31.711
I think we should go
with the black leggings.

30:31.712 --> 30:33.311
Yeah, maybe you're right,
actually.

30:33.312 --> 30:34.711
Rae, try these leggings on.

30:34.712 --> 30:38.031
Oh, right.

30:38.032 --> 30:41.111
What happened to your legs,
Rae?

30:41.112 --> 30:44.551
I was in an accident
when I was in France.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.831
Oh, my God!

30:46.832 --> 30:50.191
Do they look horrible?

30:50.192 --> 30:52.751
You can't even really notice them.

30:52.752 --> 30:56.751
D'you think Archie
will be turned off by them?

30:59.432 --> 31:01.591
Maybe we could put
some makeup on 'em.

31:01.592 --> 31:03.151
Would that work?

31:03.152 --> 31:04.711
We could try.

31:04.712 --> 31:06.951
But if we're gonna put
makeup on your legs, Rae,

31:06.952 --> 31:10.071
it seems mad not to let me do
all your makeup properly.

31:10.072 --> 31:14.071
All right!
Yeah!

31:14.152 --> 31:16.671
Rae...

31:16.672 --> 31:19.791
um, why didn't you tell me?

31:19.792 --> 31:23.791
Eh? Come here!

31:34.032 --> 31:38.031
If you want to make someone
touch you and you can't change
the way you look,

31:38.792 --> 31:41.991
I guess the next best thing is
to hide it, with makeup,

31:41.992 --> 31:45.031
with clothes, with whatever
you can find.

31:45.032 --> 31:47.591
I feel sick.

31:47.592 --> 31:50.911
Maybe I should just cancel.
No. Look at me.

31:50.912 --> 31:54.911
We haven't spend three hours
making you look super foxy
for you to walk away.

31:55.112 --> 31:57.871
Me and Chlo will come in
for the first 20 minutes.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.111
Make sure everything's OK.

32:00.112 --> 32:04.111
Well, you go first, foxy lady.
Oh, shut up!

32:08.592 --> 32:10.471
Hi.

32:10.472 --> 32:13.071
Who are you? Who's that?

32:13.072 --> 32:17.071
Um... This is my Uncle Kester.
These are my friends.

32:18.192 --> 32:20.151
Chloe. Hi.

32:20.152 --> 32:21.631
Izzy. Hiya.

32:21.632 --> 32:22.831
Hello.

32:22.832 --> 32:25.911
Are you the uncle
Rae stopped with in France?

32:25.912 --> 32:29.391
Yeah. That... That...
That's right.Bonjour!

32:29.392 --> 32:33.391
Er, peut-etre que je peux pratiquer
mon francais avec vous?

32:38.112 --> 32:42.111
Er, I'm... I don't speak
French when I'm in England.

32:42.712 --> 32:45.391
In case I forget how
to speak English.

32:45.392 --> 32:46.631
Oh, right.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.911
Oh, my God, Rae was just telling me

32:48.912 --> 32:50.311
about her accident.
Chloe...

32:50.312 --> 32:54.231
We've gotta go.

32:54.232 --> 32:57.071
It was lovely to meet you
anyway. Bye.

32:57.072 --> 33:01.071
Ciao.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.111
Can I have a coffee, please?

33:13.112 --> 33:17.111
Thanks.

33:53.272 --> 33:54.311
Yo.

33:54.312 --> 33:55.671
What are you doing here?

33:55.672 --> 33:57.071
I've just seen Archie.

33:57.072 --> 33:58.351
He ain't coming.

33:58.352 --> 34:02.351
He said to say... Well,
he said to say that, really.

34:03.512 --> 34:06.311
Right.

34:06.312 --> 34:10.311
Why are you dressed like Chloe?
I'm not dressed like Chloe.

34:10.831 --> 34:11.911
OK.

34:11.911 --> 34:15.911
See you later, then.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.351
Rae, what did Finn say?

34:24.351 --> 34:28.351
Don't. Just leave me alone.

36:00.850 --> 36:04.849
' "When Alexander the Great saw
the breadth of his domain, he wept,

36:05.810 --> 36:09.809
' "for there were no more worlds
to conquer."

36:09.810 --> 36:13.049
'That's Archie's favourite quote.

36:13.050 --> 36:16.114
'My domain is my bed.
'I'm weeping for the opposite reason.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.979
'The world has conquered me.'

36:20.980 --> 36:22.939
It's midday.

36:22.940 --> 36:26.939
I know.

36:27.180 --> 36:31.179
I'm just about to make
a sausage casserole.

36:31.380 --> 36:33.819
Not hungry.

36:33.820 --> 36:37.819
I've got tiger bread
and spread for dipping.

36:43.580 --> 36:45.739
What spread is it?

36:45.740 --> 36:46.979
Lurpak.

36:46.980 --> 36:50.219
Normal or unsalted?

36:50.220 --> 36:51.859
Normal.

36:51.860 --> 36:55.859
Obviously.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.339
I thought about it.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.699
I shouldn't have gone out.

37:07.700 --> 37:11.699
I deserve to be grounded.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.379
Right.

37:14.380 --> 37:16.459
Right, well, um...

37:16.460 --> 37:20.459
since you've thought about it
and you're sorry...

37:20.780 --> 37:22.539
I don't think you do
need to be grounded.

37:22.576 --> 37:23.855
You can go out, if you want.

37:23.856 --> 37:27.655
Just behave yourself,
be responsible.

37:28.856 --> 37:32.855
Karim.

37:37.936 --> 37:40.495
Rae, it's for you.

37:40.496 --> 37:44.495
It's a young man.

37:48.296 --> 37:49.935
What?

37:49.936 --> 37:51.575
I came about yesterday.

37:51.576 --> 37:53.815
Come to take the piss, have you?
No.

37:53.816 --> 37:55.415
Just save it.
I would never have done it

37:55.416 --> 37:57.895
if I knew
you were supposed to be on a date.

37:57.896 --> 38:00.695
Oh. How very grown-up of you!

38:00.696 --> 38:02.855
Look, I know you don't like me,
and that's fine, right?

38:02.856 --> 38:04.695
But I just...

38:04.696 --> 38:08.535
I think he's a dick for what he did.

38:08.536 --> 38:12.535
I didn't want you adding it
to the very long list
of things you hate about me.

38:19.376 --> 38:23.335
Finn.

38:23.336 --> 38:27.335
The list isn't that long.

38:28.776 --> 38:32.135
Archie's at work
at the leisure centre right now.

38:32.136 --> 38:34.375
If I were you, I'd find him

38:34.376 --> 38:36.935
and I'd stick a fucking boot
right up his arse.

38:50.456 --> 38:52.895
Weight Watchers is Tuesday.
Yeah?

38:52.896 --> 38:54.895
Why don't you just tell me where
Archie is

38:54.896 --> 38:57.495
before I wrap my fist
right round your nose?

38:57.496 --> 38:58.575
He's in the wet rooms.

38:58.576 --> 39:00.215
But it's 50p admission, though.

39:00.308 --> 39:01.427
Fuck off!

39:40.268 --> 39:42.427
Rae! Shit!

39:42.428 --> 39:44.547
Are you peeping?
No. No, no.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.107
No. No. It's not what it looks like.

39:47.108 --> 39:49.827
Because it looks like you're a
pervert. No. Er... It...

39:49.828 --> 39:51.467
Let me explain. It... It's just...

39:51.468 --> 39:52.907
It... I swear.

39:52.908 --> 39:53.947
Move. Please.

39:53.948 --> 39:55.107
Archie, move.
Rae, no. No!

39:55.108 --> 39:57.747
Move! Rae!

39:57.748 --> 40:00.107
Rae.

40:00.108 --> 40:04.107
Rae. Just...

40:08.348 --> 40:10.427
Rae, please...

40:10.428 --> 40:12.747
Rae, please. Please stop.
Stop. Look at me.

40:12.748 --> 40:14.667
Just... Just stop a second.
I knew it!

40:14.668 --> 40:16.627
I knew you couldn't
possibly like me.

40:16.628 --> 40:17.667
Shh!

40:17.668 --> 40:19.307
How could you do this to me?

40:19.308 --> 40:22.267
Why not just leave me alone
in the first place?

40:22.268 --> 40:23.907
Rae, please.
I know that I'm ugly and I know

40:23.908 --> 40:27.907
that boys don't like me, so why...
why make me think that you did?

40:28.508 --> 40:30.507
I'm really sorry. OK?

40:30.508 --> 40:32.347
Just, please...

40:32.348 --> 40:33.827
Oh, my God!

40:33.828 --> 40:36.107
Did I do it?

40:36.108 --> 40:38.627
Did I make you gay?
No, no, no, no, of course not.

40:38.628 --> 40:40.067
Was it me? Shh!

40:40.068 --> 40:44.067
Just... Just calm down. Just wait.

40:51.228 --> 40:54.387
I bottled it.

40:54.388 --> 40:58.387
I thought if I tried to be straight
for a bit... then maybe...

41:00.588 --> 41:02.267
You don't know what it's like.

41:02.268 --> 41:06.267
Having this big bloody secret
that could come out at any moment.

41:07.188 --> 41:11.187
It's horrible.

41:11.308 --> 41:15.067
I'm really sorry.

41:15.068 --> 41:18.147
What did you think...

41:18.148 --> 41:19.867
when you saw my legs...

41:19.868 --> 41:21.947
at the pool party?

41:21.948 --> 41:24.027
Dunno. Er...

41:24.028 --> 41:28.387
- I thought you'd been in
an accident or something.
- Did you think I was a freak?

41:28.388 --> 41:32.387
Why would I ever think that?

41:40.268 --> 41:43.667
Why don't you just be brave
and tell people?

41:43.668 --> 41:46.747
Then you'd be free to be yourself.

41:46.748 --> 41:48.587
You wouldn't have to
worry all the time.

41:48.588 --> 41:52.507
Come out, in Lincolnshire,
when I'm still in high school?

41:52.508 --> 41:56.507
That's not bravery.
That's just asking for it.

41:57.948 --> 42:00.387
RH Tawney said...

42:00.388 --> 42:03.347
"What's freedom for the pike
is death for the minnow."

42:03.348 --> 42:05.707
I think I believe that.

42:05.708 --> 42:08.187
Archie...

42:08.188 --> 42:10.467
You know, for a gayer...

42:10.468 --> 42:14.467
you really are
a boring fucker sometimes!

42:16.348 --> 42:18.147
D'you know what?

42:18.148 --> 42:22.147
There is one thing you can do
to make it up to me.

42:23.868 --> 42:27.867
'Well, Chop said that
Archie literally, like,
begged you to forgive him'

42:28.268 --> 42:31.507
- and then he asked you to go out
with him, and you said no.
- 'Yeah,'

42:31.508 --> 42:34.667
he did beg and that, but whatever.

42:34.668 --> 42:38.667
I'm just... I'm at a stage in my life
where I am loving being single.

42:39.188 --> 42:41.427
That is so hardcore!

42:41.428 --> 42:45.427
'Why didn't I think of that?'

42:51.708 --> 42:55.707
It's fucking embarrassing
how good I look some days.

42:57.268 --> 42:58.547
So...

42:58.548 --> 43:01.787
how long does it take
for you to actually believe it?

43:01.788 --> 43:05.787
Oh, I think it's a lifelong project
for everyone.

43:11.628 --> 43:15.427
Rae!

43:15.492 --> 43:19.491
Danny, Tix would like
to say something to you.

43:25.787 --> 43:26.866
I'm...

43:26.891 --> 43:29.730
sorry for hitting you with the tray.

43:29.731 --> 43:33.170
Repeatedly hitting you
with the tray.

43:33.171 --> 43:34.450
That's all right.

43:34.451 --> 43:37.970
I should've remembered
not to surprise you like that.

43:37.971 --> 43:41.970
I forgot you don't like it.

43:53.322 --> 43:54.721
Please take your hand off mine.

43:59.722 --> 44:03.721
'Maybe some bodies
weren't meant to be touched.

44:04.122 --> 44:07.241
'Maybe my body
wasn't meant to be stroked...'
