00:43.568 --> 00:45.982
<i> And now begins the ancient word,</i>

00:46.341 --> 00:48.794
<i>the sun sleeps below the sky,</i>

00:49.757 --> 00:51.895
<i>and the world turns upside down.</i>

00:52.538 --> 00:55.221
<i>In the night, we make our feast.</i>

00:58.104 --> 01:01.707
<i>For centuries I danced for
them, the blood-gatherer,</i>

01:01.934 --> 01:03.500
<i>the bringer of souls.</i>

01:03.788 --> 01:05.871
<i>I brought them the lost ones,</i>

01:06.059 --> 01:09.162
<i>the troubled ones, the desperate ones.</i>

01:10.862 --> 01:13.362
<i>Now I am free...</i>

01:13.693 --> 01:16.430
<i>and the world turns upside down again.</i>

01:17.522 --> 01:19.640
<i>They are thirsty for revenge,</i>

01:19.702 --> 01:21.524
<i>and nothing will stop them.</i>

01:21.616 --> 01:24.156
<i>No boundaries, no borders.</i>

01:24.181 --> 01:25.767
<i>They will come for me,</i>

01:26.080 --> 01:28.293
<i>but I am coming for them.</i>

01:28.767 --> 01:31.061
<i>Their empire of blood will fall,</i>

01:31.150 --> 01:36.695
<i>and I will not rest until it all burns.</i>

02:57.635 --> 02:58.604
<i> Mi diosa.</i>

02:59.303 --> 03:00.725
You were mesmerizing.

03:01.856 --> 03:04.411
He has no idea
how special you are.

03:05.340 --> 03:07.784
He will never
appreciate you like I do.

03:09.237 --> 03:11.388
I think you appreciate her too much.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.704
Don't you have a floor to mop?

03:34.313 --> 03:36.407
I wonder what other lies
he's told you.

03:37.352 --> 03:39.209
I know how special you are.

03:41.345 --> 03:42.499
The question is...

03:43.147 --> 03:44.378
do you?

03:46.608 --> 03:47.717
Face me.

03:54.573 --> 03:56.197
How did you feel out there?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.358
Just like you said I would.

03:59.947 --> 04:01.784
They were eating from
the palm of my hand.

04:01.832 --> 04:03.389
Your lips speak the truth...

04:04.643 --> 04:06.427
but your eyes say otherwise.

04:08.172 --> 04:09.953
What were you before we met?

04:10.875 --> 04:12.495
A little girl lost.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.064
And now you're a goddess.

04:17.209 --> 04:18.250
Say it.

04:18.773 --> 04:20.423
I am a goddess.

04:23.171 --> 04:24.360
Say it again.

04:25.543 --> 04:26.829
I am a goddess.

04:26.857 --> 04:28.298
Say it again!

04:28.746 --> 04:30.468
I am a goddess.

04:31.946 --> 04:33.007
That's it.

04:37.582 --> 04:39.328
Now act like it.

04:40.230 --> 04:41.340
For your Lord.

04:50.217 --> 04:51.411
You're being quiet.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.254
- I'm thinking.
- Thinking about what?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.335
It's a simple plan.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.194
This is your plan, by the way.

05:01.057 --> 05:03.024
Use Paloma
and the girls as bait,

05:03.867 --> 05:05.040
follow the flesh.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.387
Find Malvado's hideout,
pop him.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.504
And then?

05:09.233 --> 05:10.049
Then?

05:10.819 --> 05:11.910
Then we're set.

05:12.153 --> 05:14.178
This guy's got
a big operation, right?

05:14.605 --> 05:16.269
We're gonna put that
to work for us.

05:20.753 --> 05:21.810
Pull over.

05:35.259 --> 05:38.566
Look, I get it. You want
to tear everything down.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.062
You're all screwed up
about the guy.

05:42.545 --> 05:44.418
Don't think that I'm
not sensitive to that.

05:45.052 --> 05:48.030
I see you dancing all alone,
burning yourself in the sunlight.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.723
But you gotta let that go.

05:50.748 --> 05:53.077
I am not gonna destroy
his operation.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.290
He is loaded, and, yes, therefore
that means that I will be loaded.

05:56.329 --> 05:58.447
But I'm not
about a smash 'n' grab job.

05:58.532 --> 06:01.817
This Gecko is not
some d-bag trigger man.

06:01.842 --> 06:03.694
He is a brilliant tactician...

06:24.275 --> 06:25.603
Wait! The car!

06:26.455 --> 06:27.507
The car!

06:28.846 --> 06:32.322
I want him dead. I want
his world turned to dust.

06:32.394 --> 06:34.397
No more slavery, Richard.

06:34.422 --> 06:37.850
Does your brilliant fucking
mind understand that?

06:39.422 --> 06:40.683
Pretty sure I got it.

07:39.127 --> 07:40.561
Good morning, sunshine.

07:41.588 --> 07:42.967
We're almost there.

07:43.942 --> 07:44.979
Where's there?

07:45.395 --> 07:46.309
Houston.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.063
What?

07:50.144 --> 07:52.966
Got rid of the little
junkie-chic look, huh?

07:53.589 --> 07:55.875
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.587
What's in Houston?

07:58.060 --> 08:02.185
- Probably the last person I can trust.
- The only person you'd get dressed up for.

08:02.210 --> 08:04.076
It sure ain't me.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.108
Not that I want
to bring this up,

08:06.133 --> 08:09.220
but we're not going to see your
brother, are you?

08:11.218 --> 08:12.061
Good.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.049
Yeah, you don't need distractions

08:14.074 --> 08:16.470
while you're making
that money back for me.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.130
Oh. Really.

08:18.155 --> 08:20.489
Must be a hell of an outfit
looking for him.

08:20.624 --> 08:23.103
- What do you mean?
- They got you paranoid back there.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.788
You were kicking me around
in that hotel room.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.228
We kind of turned into a country
song there for a second.

08:27.253 --> 08:28.794
Yeah, okay, um...

08:29.800 --> 08:31.140
Look, about that...

08:31.165 --> 08:33.068
- I'm.. I don't know.
- You get a pass.

08:33.527 --> 08:35.215
Okay. One pass.

08:35.606 --> 08:38.018
You were in a dark place.
I've been there before.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.340
So what exactly were you running
from down there, anyway?

08:43.006 --> 08:46.306
Wasn't trying to get away
from anything. Just...

08:47.795 --> 08:49.546
trying to find something new.

08:50.451 --> 08:51.494
You want new?

08:52.323 --> 08:53.516
I'm gonna get you new.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.318
From here on out, it's all new.

08:56.660 --> 08:57.501
Okay?

08:58.412 --> 08:59.661
All right.

09:03.384 --> 09:06.418
Well, Governor,
it's a big state.

09:07.806 --> 09:09.531
Yeah, I know.

09:10.847 --> 09:15.391
Actually I think I might be in Mexico
around that time. But...

09:17.331 --> 09:18.777
I'm sure we can work something out.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.489
Love to see you and Jeanette.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.908
Brunch? Um...

09:24.071 --> 09:27.769
Let's make it dinner.
I... eh, I'm not a brunch guy.

09:29.827 --> 09:30.733
Be in touch.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.606
Just build
that interstate,<i> cabrón.</i>

09:37.251 --> 09:38.109
What do you want?

09:38.454 --> 09:39.295
These.

09:39.503 --> 09:40.989
Sex Machine needs the map.

09:41.106 --> 09:42.527
He needs to start the search.

09:43.251 --> 09:44.457
Take them. Go.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.673
You do realize that
once you have the treasure,

09:51.715 --> 09:53.482
you can't open it
without a key.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.154
Are we still talking?

09:56.009 --> 09:57.547
What if she finds it first?

09:58.509 --> 10:00.027
She doesn't care about that.

10:00.052 --> 10:02.920
Well I hear that she took one
of your flesh deliveries.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.363
Is that why you're
so irritable,<i> Jefe?</i>

10:06.388 --> 10:07.557
You've lost some weight.

10:09.366 --> 10:11.229
I've got someone
on the case.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.536
<i>El Regulador?</i> Yeah.
I know him. Cool guy.

10:14.622 --> 10:15.517
Cool guy.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.950
But I have to tell you...
<i>es un perro...</i>

10:19.647 --> 10:20.758
<i>y nada más.</i>

10:21.436 --> 10:24.391
And a dog is only good
when it's got a scent.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.169
And if you want Santanico,

10:26.383 --> 10:28.167
you don't need anyone
with a nose.

10:29.399 --> 10:31.232
You need someone
with a brain.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.392
Yeah?

10:36.533 --> 10:38.029
Someone with a cock.

10:38.885 --> 10:40.406
I know why
you want to find her.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.869
You want to start fucking
her again, don't you?

10:42.983 --> 10:45.686
You're the one that shared
her with me, Your Eminence.

10:45.736 --> 10:47.908
It's my way of keeping her
in the temple.

10:48.671 --> 10:49.828
But you know what?

10:50.107 --> 10:52.413
I can give this map
to <i> el profesor</i> myself.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.317
I don't even need you anymore.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.611
I built your flesh business.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.323
And now that she knows
you're using it to feed,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.079
she'll attack again.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.689
You know she's trying
to find this place.

11:07.511 --> 11:09.084
She'll never find it.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.350
And pretty soon she'll be
back where she belongs.

11:15.453 --> 11:18.750
You see that? That is
how it ought be, my friend.

11:18.867 --> 11:21.136
Coitus is a natural
human function,

11:21.161 --> 11:23.591
fundamental
physiological need.

11:23.691 --> 11:24.928
Thanks, sweetheart.

11:25.359 --> 11:28.076
All this stuff that we put
between the dick and pussy,

11:28.479 --> 11:31.223
like love, marriage, clothing.

11:31.899 --> 11:32.806
Come on.

11:33.233 --> 11:34.606
Gets in the way, man.

11:35.316 --> 11:36.788
It's like
with taking a crap.

11:37.121 --> 11:39.988
Did you know that
the man-made toilet,

11:40.124 --> 11:42.454
the crapper, has vitiated
the natural way

11:42.493 --> 11:44.454
we were meant
to evacuate our bowels?

11:45.345 --> 11:46.523
You're supposed to squat.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.214
- Straightens out the colon.
- Exactly.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.064
Exactly. You squat
when you take a shit?

11:52.239 --> 11:55.106
- Fuck, no.
- Fuck no! 'Cause it ain't natural right.

11:55.559 --> 11:58.452
See that's how upside down and
sideways our world has become.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.929
What's man-made
now feels natural.

12:00.978 --> 12:02.870
Like cutting off
a brother's head.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.269
- That ain't natural.
- What are you doing man?

12:05.294 --> 12:07.687
- Did I ask you to speak?
- No, sir.

12:08.331 --> 12:10.464
Then go out back
and sit with the vehicles.

12:13.070 --> 12:14.740
Am I a parking attendant now?

12:15.601 --> 12:17.282
You're whatever
I say you are.

12:18.172 --> 12:18.989
Go.

12:24.399 --> 12:26.396
I expect
to see you on that stage.

12:29.423 --> 12:32.606
This one here needs
an attitude adjustment.

12:32.793 --> 12:35.801
If you can't turn her out at curtain call,
she doesn't set foot on that stage.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.010
I'll take care of her.

12:37.514 --> 12:40.092
All right, ladies.
Let's go.

12:40.157 --> 12:43.350
If there's enough beauty in here to bring out,
it should have happened by now.

12:43.382 --> 12:45.438
- Go. Five minutes.
- _

12:45.742 --> 12:48.219
_

12:48.275 --> 12:49.209
What are you doing?

12:51.267 --> 12:53.511
- Hey!
- I'm not going out there.

12:53.536 --> 12:57.173
Remember what I told you?
No one is gonna touch you.

12:57.564 --> 12:59.392
We're gonna go all the way to the top.

12:59.536 --> 13:02.349
- We're gonna destroy them together.
- I'm not going!

13:03.177 --> 13:05.588
Fine. Be that way.

13:07.114 --> 13:08.044
This'll make her dance.

13:11.632 --> 13:14.276
I'm sorry,
you did not just touch me!

13:23.677 --> 13:25.053
What the hell
are we waiting for?

13:32.019 --> 13:34.808
- It was necessary.
- Long as we make the sale.

13:36.824 --> 13:38.370
You will see me as her.

13:38.992 --> 13:41.913
Everyone will.
But only for a little while.

13:43.351 --> 13:44.568
<i>La diosa!</i>

13:45.456 --> 13:47.864
I'm not a goddess.
You are.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.575
Now act like one.

14:55.202 --> 14:56.763
I thought you would have
come home sooner.

14:59.262 --> 15:02.541
I didn't have a reason to
until I knew you were actually here.

15:02.566 --> 15:04.596
- Who told you?
- Jessica.

15:04.714 --> 15:06.837
She said you were hanging
outside of school.

15:07.387 --> 15:09.159
She wanted to know
if I was back too.

15:09.639 --> 15:10.827
Bitches be textin'.

15:12.110 --> 15:12.768
Don't.

15:13.476 --> 15:14.326
I'm...

15:14.378 --> 15:16.027
I'm just trying to help you Scott.

15:17.564 --> 15:18.529
Help me?

15:19.899 --> 15:21.019
Like you helped Dad?

15:26.990 --> 15:28.201
What are you doing?

15:28.304 --> 15:29.811
Just grabbing something
for the road.

15:30.710 --> 15:33.097
What? Didn't know
about Dad's secret stash?

15:38.084 --> 15:39.328
He was weak, Kate.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.470
No, you're weak.

15:43.673 --> 15:45.309
You're sick and starving.

15:45.475 --> 15:47.785
And the neighborhood cats
aren't going to be enough.

15:48.228 --> 15:49.478
What do you know about it?

15:50.930 --> 15:53.008
I know that
Miss Downton Tabby

15:53.033 --> 15:55.032
isn't gonna be enough
to hold you over.

15:57.151 --> 15:58.522
You shouldn't have
come back.

15:59.968 --> 16:03.038
Scott, this is our home.

16:03.085 --> 16:05.213
And I know that you wouldn't
have come back to back home,

16:05.238 --> 16:08.220
if there wasn't some part of you that
thought you could live a normal life again.

16:08.597 --> 16:09.638
No, Kate.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.697
I'm part of something
bigger now. Much bigger.

16:14.806 --> 16:15.753
Where are you going?

16:16.484 --> 16:19.011
- The night is young.
- Scott, wait.

16:23.263 --> 16:24.069
Scott!

16:30.220 --> 16:31.219
Scott!

16:51.875 --> 16:52.684
Really?

16:55.085 --> 16:58.014
What the hell do you think you're doing,
letting yourself in here like this?

16:58.039 --> 16:59.904
I think maybe you should have move
the spare key.

17:00.266 --> 17:02.227
You wanna lower
the cannon, please?

17:04.753 --> 17:06.692
- What do you want?
- Eddie.

17:07.454 --> 17:10.159
Come on. I got
a 13-inch tube that needs...

17:10.184 --> 17:13.384
What in God's name is
a fine young lady like yourself

17:13.409 --> 17:16.205
doing with a no-good-low-down
shit-bird like him?

17:16.231 --> 17:19.500
- Okay, easy there.
- Excuse me, I'm talking to Miss...?

17:19.669 --> 17:20.642
Sonja.

17:20.737 --> 17:24.021
Sonja. He only comes calling
when he needs something.

17:24.107 --> 17:26.646
- That's not true!
- And right about now he's gonna flash

17:26.693 --> 17:28.388
that shit-eatin' grin
of his.

17:28.745 --> 17:31.577
Okay. Eddie, will you
just calm yourself, please?

17:32.615 --> 17:33.472
Thank you.

17:34.617 --> 17:37.592
Look, I just came here
to ask you one thing.

17:38.037 --> 17:40.889
- Oh, forget it. I can't do it.
- It's just till I get back on my feet.

17:40.924 --> 17:43.218
You think I got scores
growing on trees?

17:43.243 --> 17:44.972
I think you got a ripe one right here.

17:46.035 --> 17:47.149
That ain't for you.

17:49.549 --> 17:51.716
Okay, fine.
What else you got, then?

17:51.741 --> 17:53.774
What else I got?
How about the shirt off my back,

17:53.803 --> 17:55.575
or maybe the change
in my pockets?

17:55.758 --> 17:59.251
You know what? Think I ought change
that... sign out the front door,

17:59.276 --> 18:02.248
where you boys keeps stopping by,
want me to fix your problems.

18:02.395 --> 18:04.450
It ought be called
the Gecko Repair Shop.

18:04.475 --> 18:06.160
Wait a second. "You boys"?
What boys?

18:06.817 --> 18:09.211
Two days ago, Richie came in here
looking for a handout.

18:09.236 --> 18:12.437
Now you're here with Red Sonja
looking for a quick way to get some gold.

18:12.462 --> 18:14.485
Except you ain't Conan no more my friend.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.351
Excuse me, would you not touch that, please?

18:16.619 --> 18:19.388
These are those
crazy monkey-shit beans.

18:19.517 --> 18:20.989
Kopi Luwak, right?

18:21.047 --> 18:22.914
Okay, she's not so bad,
but you.

18:22.939 --> 18:24.934
Okay, can we just back up
for a second here please?

18:25.585 --> 18:26.828
You said Richard was here?

18:27.530 --> 18:28.992
What, am I slurring my words?

18:29.429 --> 18:31.840
- What did he want?
- He wanted a favor, just like you.

18:31.865 --> 18:32.785
Oh, okay.

18:33.826 --> 18:37.572
- You know what? Forget it.
- You're supposed to look out for him.

18:37.730 --> 18:39.716
- Don't start with me.
- He's family.

18:39.741 --> 18:42.575
- Not anymore.
- Oh that's funny, he said the same thing.

18:45.198 --> 18:47.745
This where you hold your
breath till one passes out?

18:49.278 --> 18:51.202
You want a juice box
or something?

18:54.548 --> 18:55.376
You can't just go out there

18:55.401 --> 18:57.253
- and start pulling jobs.
- Why the hell not?

18:57.298 --> 18:59.743
"Cause the name Seth Gecko
doesn't mean anything anymore."

18:59.768 --> 19:02.284
A lot mayhem. Your brother made that
<i>Walker, Texas Ranger,</i>

19:02.309 --> 19:04.139
car-off-the-cliff shit stick.

19:04.674 --> 19:06.928
You're dead, literally.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.872
Okay, fine. Then I'll start from scratch.

19:10.213 --> 19:12.229
Okay. Gimme something simple.

19:13.276 --> 19:17.121
I'd give him a shot,
but I'm biased, so...

19:30.069 --> 19:31.302
What you doin' with that?

19:31.701 --> 19:35.322
Self-defense, dude. Never know
what you might find out in the woods.

19:35.347 --> 19:37.217
Hey, if we find your balls,
you can scoop 'em right up.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.292
Ah, he is right. It's never this quiet.

19:39.455 --> 19:41.993
Hey, you think someone's
pulling catfishhere on this?

19:42.441 --> 19:44.810
Not unless you guys
started banging freshmen.

19:45.191 --> 19:47.270
Fuller! Where did you
come from?

19:47.467 --> 19:50.240
- I am the one that texted you.
- Since when did you know about the party hut?

19:50.265 --> 19:52.929
Ah, screw that! Since when
are you still breathing?

19:53.139 --> 19:55.936
We heard about your dad going all
schizo when your mom died.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.555
Chop-sueyed you and your
sister and skipped town.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.833
Chop suey.
That's... that's funny.

20:01.264 --> 20:02.105
I'm a clown.

20:03.683 --> 20:04.849
Do I look dead to you?

20:06.855 --> 20:08.951
No. Come on, boys.

20:11.346 --> 20:12.510
Shoo...!

20:12.535 --> 20:13.807
Is that...?

20:14.346 --> 20:17.582
We are gonna need serious
snackage to go with that.

20:17.607 --> 20:21.343
Guys, guys. Yo.
I'm all set on food.

20:21.617 --> 20:23.759
Let's go. Let's go.

20:24.370 --> 20:25.768
<i> I don't know</i>
<i>what he's gonna do.</i>

20:26.284 --> 20:28.804
I tried to talk to him,
but he got away from me.

20:29.815 --> 20:32.330
I never should've left him
in that awful place, and...

20:32.712 --> 20:34.629
I think that maybe
they brainwashed him,

20:35.100 --> 20:37.848
and made him believe that
he belongs with them now.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.988
Look, I'm sorry
to ramble on like this.

20:41.354 --> 20:43.812
I don't know
who else to call.

20:44.107 --> 20:45.552
I know that I can help him.

20:46.271 --> 20:48.994
I just can't do it alone,
so please...

20:49.877 --> 20:51.559
Please, just call me back.

21:09.651 --> 21:12.135
Ohh. Think I'm
gonna yack, boys.

21:15.260 --> 21:18.046
Yo. We gotta get
you outside, man.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.217
- Outside?
- Yeah.

21:19.294 --> 21:21.327
- Why?
- Barfing's contagious.

21:21.496 --> 21:24.578
Plus, gotta get you back for all
those times you picked on me last year.

21:28.963 --> 21:31.127
- Do this first.
- No way, dude.

21:38.111 --> 21:39.677
Ohhhh!

21:39.779 --> 21:41.305
Do it again, man!

21:41.781 --> 21:44.115
There you are. Thought you
fell in man, sit down.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.120
- Let's go. Here we go.
- Missing the show.

21:46.867 --> 21:48.692
Good, good. Here we go.

21:48.789 --> 21:49.475
Huh?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.416
Smile. Smiles, please.

21:51.624 --> 21:54.094
Dresses are a nice touch.
Should charge more for that.

21:57.460 --> 21:59.231
Oh, my God. Look at that.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.497
That is a peach
right there.

22:03.205 --> 22:05.471
Hey, how they doing?

22:06.119 --> 22:08.723
- Had a little trouble with one of them.
- Yeah?

22:10.693 --> 22:12.948
- But she got in line.
- That's good.

22:13.696 --> 22:16.273
Did Mr. Sanz dear tell you
about his demands?

22:16.540 --> 22:17.706
He just did.

22:18.157 --> 22:21.075
Can't sell his girls to the Browns
if the Browns aren't here.

22:21.657 --> 22:24.311
Don't get your panties
in a bunch baby. I got you.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.531
Here's Carlos now.

22:32.070 --> 22:33.349
Carlos, my friend.

22:33.716 --> 22:34.551
Carlos.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.105
- Carlos, my favorite buyer.
- Blanchard.

22:41.130 --> 22:44.061
Listen. When I'll get your bid number
set up right away.

22:44.138 --> 22:45.476
As you can see you're gonna need it.

22:45.501 --> 22:47.702
In the meantime there's someone
I want you to... meet.

22:48.139 --> 22:49.017
Who's that?

22:49.327 --> 22:52.648
Ah... our new supplier. But I don't
know where he really gotten off to.

22:53.124 --> 22:55.040
Here, I got your table all set up.

22:55.171 --> 22:57.883
Candy, get over here and take care
of Señor Madrigal, okay?

22:57.908 --> 23:00.293
Anything you need.
Talk to you soon.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.394
This is a problem.

23:02.918 --> 23:05.305
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is good.

23:06.082 --> 23:07.315
We stick to the plan.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.385
Carlos won't be able to resist.
He'll purchase Paloma.

23:11.410 --> 23:13.411
and we'll follow him
to Malvado's hideout.

23:18.161 --> 23:19.609
Carlos Madrigal.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.136
Leave the door open,
anything'll walk in.

23:24.522 --> 23:27.234
Diana. So nice to see you.

23:28.171 --> 23:29.481
I need something...

23:30.123 --> 23:31.250
exceptional.

23:32.045 --> 23:32.860
Ohh.

23:33.243 --> 23:35.094
Right to the point today.

23:36.186 --> 23:37.282
Well you know me.

23:38.548 --> 23:40.660
How long has it been, huh?

23:44.804 --> 23:46.508
When was the last time
I came here?

23:47.156 --> 23:48.187
February?

23:49.984 --> 23:51.455
It's been too long.

23:53.020 --> 23:54.615
Why don't you
get comfortable.

23:54.847 --> 23:57.617
Something exceptional
is coming right up.

23:58.315 --> 23:59.993
You'll know her
when you see her.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.233
Yeah. You're good.

24:06.881 --> 24:08.431
She looks just like new.

24:08.679 --> 24:10.706
I'm just glad
it's not on your ass.

24:12.365 --> 24:14.348
Yeah, I can see
you love what you do.

24:15.404 --> 24:17.190
Have tattoo gun,
will travel.

24:17.443 --> 24:19.123
Practically an appendage.

24:20.245 --> 24:21.288
That's right.

24:21.424 --> 24:22.954
Lets you do
what you do best.

24:23.426 --> 24:25.908
Sometimes that's
the tool in your hand and...

24:26.720 --> 24:29.031
Well, sometimes it's the tool
at your side.

24:29.109 --> 24:30.869
- You know what I mean?
- Easy.

24:32.135 --> 24:34.809
Seth can be a tool,
you got that right.

24:35.648 --> 24:39.007
But what he and I have, it's a business
arrangement it's pure and simple.

24:39.058 --> 24:41.359
- Business?
- Till I get what he owes me.

24:41.477 --> 24:44.312
Yeah, I guess it's best to keep it casual.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.970
Best for you and Seth.

24:45.995 --> 24:48.695
Because it's his brother lets him do
what he does best.

24:48.785 --> 24:51.369
As far as I can tell,
all Richie's done

24:51.394 --> 24:54.318
is leave Seth to rot in a
shithole south of the border.

24:54.956 --> 24:56.225
He's better off without him.

24:56.534 --> 24:59.482
Yeah, I'm sure Seth's ex-wife
would agree with you there.

25:00.948 --> 25:02.995
Ow! Goddamn, woman.

25:03.216 --> 25:03.954
Sorry.

25:04.125 --> 25:05.601
What your doing, tattooing my bone?

25:05.626 --> 25:06.820
It's a dull needle.

25:07.488 --> 25:09.330
Been working
on thick skin lately.

25:10.673 --> 25:12.233
You seem like a smart girl.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.976
Last smart girl to come
between those brothers

25:15.061 --> 25:17.049
ended up doing
two dimes at Hilltop.

25:17.666 --> 25:20.170
Bottom line is,
when it comes to Richie,

25:20.233 --> 25:22.104
it's not a matter
of <i> if</i> but <i> when</i>

25:22.158 --> 25:24.482
Seth mends the fence,
and when he does,

25:24.570 --> 25:27.346
I'd just hate to see you
standing all alone on the other side.

25:33.112 --> 25:35.881
Everybody loves a good underdog
story, wouldn't you say?

25:37.617 --> 25:40.175
See somebody triumph
in the face of adversity.

25:42.601 --> 25:46.492
See somebody taking punches.
Get knocked down.

25:46.820 --> 25:49.266
Drag themselves back up,
keep on swinging.

25:49.389 --> 25:50.309
That's <i> Rocky.</i>

25:51.909 --> 25:53.619
Greatest underdog story
ever told.

25:54.394 --> 25:56.838
You know, it's funny, but eh...

25:58.521 --> 26:01.433
a lot of people forget that he
actually loses in that first movie.

26:01.693 --> 26:02.459
You know?

26:03.481 --> 26:04.871
That's the whole point,
you see.

26:05.695 --> 26:07.524
Even in the face of defeat,

26:07.879 --> 26:09.488
he had his chance
to prove himself.

26:09.656 --> 26:10.822
And he gets the girl.

26:12.068 --> 26:15.819
I mean don't get me wrong here.
You know the sequels were fun and all.

26:15.988 --> 26:17.714
Mr. T's always good
for a laugh.

26:18.491 --> 26:21.132
But nobody wants to see greased up
Dolph Lundgren with his...

26:21.944 --> 26:24.264
cheesy Russian accent
go home with the belt you know.

26:24.752 --> 26:26.941
It's not the same anymore.
It's not an underdog story.

26:27.822 --> 26:29.436
That's a valid point, son.

26:31.221 --> 26:32.920
But I ain't
giving you the cash.

26:32.945 --> 26:34.620
Larry, you got it
and then some.

26:35.203 --> 26:37.215
Now, that 442 back there
is worth,

26:37.894 --> 26:39.456
what,
six times what you owe?

26:39.979 --> 26:43.268
From the looks I'd say you boys are doing
some pretty nice work around here.

26:44.266 --> 26:48.089
Eddie says you've been doing brisk
business ever since he gave you that loan.

26:48.114 --> 26:49.291
and get you back at your feet.

26:49.337 --> 26:52.671
Eddie and his ridiculous
interest...

26:53.189 --> 26:55.260
can suck my lily-white ass.

26:55.634 --> 26:58.592
And you, you call yourself a collector?

26:58.767 --> 27:00.427
Why should I deliver to you?

27:02.300 --> 27:03.885
Who the fuck are you?

27:05.538 --> 27:06.949
Ah, well,

27:07.373 --> 27:10.758
at this moment,
right now, I'm nobody.

27:12.261 --> 27:14.953
But in 3.2 seconds,
I can be any number of people.

27:16.799 --> 27:18.299
I can be Mr. Switzerland.

27:19.519 --> 27:22.269
Gets along with all the other
nations around him.

27:22.355 --> 27:24.517
Keeps good time.
Makes fine chocolate.

27:26.152 --> 27:30.663
Now, Mr. Switzerland would politely take
receipt of the monies and be on his way.

27:32.363 --> 27:33.510
I can be him.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.238
Or I can be Mr. North Korea.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.823
I think you know what I mean
when I say Mr. North Korea.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.913
- Crazy motherfucker.
- Crazy motherfucker.

27:44.721 --> 27:46.266
Allright, tell you what.

27:48.915 --> 27:51.872
How about I have my boy Wade
here shoot you in the face?

27:53.836 --> 27:55.694
Then you could be Mr. Guam...

27:57.139 --> 27:59.473
who nobody gives a fuck about.

28:05.102 --> 28:06.334
I'm not gonna do that.

28:14.399 --> 28:15.606
Wise choice.

28:18.360 --> 28:19.768
Eddie says "much grass."

28:26.619 --> 28:27.785
You know who am I now?

28:28.771 --> 28:30.379
I'm Seth Gecko, motherfucker.

28:38.708 --> 28:41.583
Scott, Scott, Scott!

28:41.630 --> 28:42.722
Shh shh.

28:47.985 --> 28:51.056
Whoa. Seriously, bro, that's
some David Blaine shit right there.

28:52.558 --> 28:53.177
Yeah.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.713
Oh, sweet. They're here.

28:55.944 --> 28:56.649
Who?

28:56.799 --> 28:58.074
Mmmm.

29:01.989 --> 29:04.565
Looks like you guys are having
all the fun without us.

29:16.530 --> 29:20.054
So what? You were like spying on me when
you saw me outside school?

29:20.079 --> 29:22.625
You mean like how you used
to always spy on me?

29:22.650 --> 29:25.702
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, please.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.557
All those sleepovers.

29:27.630 --> 29:30.451
Listening outside
your sister's bedroom door.

29:30.466 --> 29:32.228
Trying to sneak a peek.

29:33.974 --> 29:35.085
Well, what could I say?

29:35.110 --> 29:37.202
You looked better than anything
I've seen on the Internet.

29:38.169 --> 29:39.040
Shut up.

29:39.357 --> 29:43.454
You know, I used to always tell
Kate that I thought you were cute.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.959
She'd get all mad
and overprotective.

29:48.631 --> 29:52.311
Even texted me tonight saying
that I should stay away from you,

29:52.405 --> 29:53.844
that you're dangerous.

29:55.107 --> 29:57.660
She's always getting
in other people's business.

29:58.911 --> 30:00.269
Is that true, Scott?

30:02.911 --> 30:04.435
Are you dangerous?

30:09.554 --> 30:12.873
<i>And sold, to our
friends</i> from Dubai, all three.

30:13.009 --> 30:14.675
Help the ladies down, will you fellas?

30:14.710 --> 30:15.576
Good job.

30:17.095 --> 30:17.949
All right.

30:18.247 --> 30:19.542
On to the main event.

30:20.516 --> 30:21.492
This...

30:22.218 --> 30:23.940
This is why
y'all came out tonight.

30:24.609 --> 30:25.676
Have a look.

30:26.331 --> 30:28.181
Who doesn't like cupcakes, right?

30:28.706 --> 30:30.291
Let's go with number 13.

30:44.438 --> 30:46.351
Dance.
Shake it for the guys.

30:58.754 --> 31:01.639
Who's got ten for me?
There's ten. Twenty?

31:02.585 --> 31:03.641
Who's got 30?

31:03.759 --> 31:06.060
Thirty, there you are.
Forty?

31:24.030 --> 31:25.249
Everything okay?

31:25.865 --> 31:28.332
Fifty?
Can we do 50? There's 50.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.692
Sixty? You know what?
I bid 60.

31:31.245 --> 31:35.307
Seventy? Who's got 70? There's
70 in the back. Eighty?

31:36.676 --> 31:38.676
Fellows,
the number is 80.

31:45.101 --> 31:46.090
Scott?

31:52.032 --> 31:54.391
Should've started at 130.
One-forty.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.360
There's 140. There you go.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.362
Now we're moving. One fif...

31:58.481 --> 31:59.813
Excuse me.

32:01.484 --> 32:02.700
Hold on a second.

32:07.657 --> 32:08.539
Boom.

32:19.825 --> 32:20.907
One second.

32:22.036 --> 32:24.015
That's a hell of a number
for one girl.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.937
- That's for all of them.
- Of course.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.467
That's it, gentlemen.

32:29.935 --> 32:33.180
We'll see that she and the rest
get delivered to your boss.

32:33.265 --> 32:34.815
Put the others in the truck.

32:36.569 --> 32:38.485
I'd like to break the seal on this one.

32:43.025 --> 32:44.109
Let's go, ladies.

33:02.969 --> 33:03.696
Scott?

33:16.082 --> 33:20.254
Scott! I knew when you grabbed Dad's
alcohol you'd come here to have a party!

33:22.134 --> 33:23.146
Oh, my God!

33:23.171 --> 33:24.740
It was an accident,
I swear.

33:26.059 --> 33:27.141
Look, Kate.

33:28.247 --> 33:29.461
I couldn't stop.

33:30.646 --> 33:31.964
I was just so...

33:32.599 --> 33:33.804
so hungry.

33:34.617 --> 33:36.149
Oh, my God, Jessica.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.162
Kate, I need your help.

33:39.939 --> 33:41.606
- Kate!
- I can't help you.

33:41.631 --> 33:42.635
Yes, you can.

33:44.016 --> 33:46.051
We need to move this body up way
before everyone else wakes up,

33:46.076 --> 33:47.703
or else we both screwed.

34:26.786 --> 34:28.181
Send me home.

34:38.772 --> 34:39.770
Katerina.

34:48.424 --> 34:49.498
Katerina, get up.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.507
A missionary can't spread the
Good News if she's sitting on her ass.

34:56.025 --> 34:57.128
I can't.

35:02.173 --> 35:03.251
Yes, you can.

35:13.499 --> 35:15.256
You came to me
because of him.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.434
You're already giving up?

35:21.601 --> 35:23.170
He killed my friend.

35:23.772 --> 35:26.319
- He's not right. He's...
- A monster.

35:26.963 --> 35:27.893
Yeah.

35:28.461 --> 35:29.885
He's just like me, Kate.

35:30.767 --> 35:31.716
No.

35:31.992 --> 35:33.896
You're different, Rafa.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.813
You... tried to help me. You...

35:37.751 --> 35:39.503
You died trying to help me.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.378
You don't think Scott's capable of that?

35:43.446 --> 35:44.612
I want him to be.

35:46.196 --> 35:47.245
Then tell him.

35:49.702 --> 35:50.825
Keep telling him.

35:53.804 --> 35:56.173
If not, someone else will
start whispering in his ear.

36:07.568 --> 36:09.263
<i> You went</i>
<i>on your own journey,</i>

36:09.639 --> 36:11.594
<i>across an ocean of sand,</i>

36:11.975 --> 36:14.989
<i>with your substitute father
and your sister.</i>

36:16.062 --> 36:18.266
<i>I didn't know
what you were capable of,</i>

36:18.762 --> 36:20.109
<i>what you could become.</i>

36:20.766 --> 36:23.824
<i>Go. Go find
a new ocean to cross.</i>

36:24.187 --> 36:27.548
<i>It might bend you
and it may break you,</i>

36:28.007 --> 36:29.939
<i>but you will learn
what you need to know.</i>

37:05.778 --> 37:08.073
You know, I met someone
down in Mexico.

37:08.671 --> 37:10.924
He learned to control
his cravings.

37:11.468 --> 37:12.773
You can learn too.

37:13.536 --> 37:17.571
We just have to find a way
without hurting innocent people.

37:19.719 --> 37:21.451
I could see into her, Kate.

37:22.484 --> 37:23.480
Her soul.

37:24.469 --> 37:27.094
You don't have any clue,
but she was totally jealous of you.

37:27.133 --> 37:29.229
Stop trying to justify
what you did.

37:29.254 --> 37:31.677
I'm not try to justify anything.
I'm telling you what I saw.

37:31.921 --> 37:33.610
I didn't just feed
off her blood.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.494
- I fed on her soul.
- What you saw was wrong.

37:37.810 --> 37:40.896
And jealous or not,
you killed an innocent girl.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.518
Look, she was just practice.

37:50.432 --> 37:53.141
- I can control myself now.
- Scott.

37:55.002 --> 37:56.286
I'm not gonna kill you.

37:58.346 --> 37:59.695
I'm gonna protect you.

38:00.916 --> 38:02.509
The only way
that I know how.

38:17.016 --> 38:17.830
No!

38:19.039 --> 38:19.717
No.

38:21.771 --> 38:23.451
That's no way to treat family.

38:40.234 --> 38:41.010
Hey.

38:41.346 --> 38:43.563
His boys got the girls all loaded up.
We need to get you down there.

38:43.642 --> 38:45.388
Just go go go go, I got it.

38:48.597 --> 38:49.797
You were incredible.

38:55.287 --> 38:57.084
How did you learn
to dance like that?

38:57.506 --> 38:58.293
Hmm?

39:05.237 --> 39:06.357
Don't be afraid.

39:06.432 --> 39:09.457
I only wish for the privilege
of dancing with you.

39:17.549 --> 39:18.671
Now, remember...

39:19.562 --> 39:21.774
it's not the steps that's important.

39:22.982 --> 39:24.113
What's important...

39:24.822 --> 39:26.748
is the person
you're dancing with.

39:34.627 --> 39:36.657
He won't appreciate you
like I do.

39:38.297 --> 39:39.382
The way you look,

39:40.413 --> 39:41.753
the way you dance.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.602
There is no worse kind of torture

39:57.808 --> 40:00.353
than being forced to love
only a part of someone...

40:05.418 --> 40:06.876
when you want the whole thing.

40:12.002 --> 40:14.043
I will never be yours.

40:14.762 --> 40:16.468
_

40:18.343 --> 40:19.449
_

40:34.220 --> 40:35.827
That's not nice.

40:43.355 --> 40:44.802
I asked for privacy.

40:45.035 --> 40:47.767
I ask that if one of
my girls forgets herself,

40:47.792 --> 40:49.928
you let me be the one
that crack the whip.

40:51.437 --> 40:53.160
Forgive me for being forward.

40:53.227 --> 40:55.974
But your boss paid a pretty penny
for top product.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.829
He has six downstairs.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.264
This one... is mine.

41:03.566 --> 41:05.806
I'm going to shower her
with gifts.

41:06.034 --> 41:08.648
I'm going to make her feel
like a goddess.

41:09.238 --> 41:10.593
I'm going to make her mine.

41:13.497 --> 41:14.535
Forever.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.327
You must have a pretty
understanding boss.

41:27.278 --> 41:29.275
Get in the truck, now.

41:30.496 --> 41:31.758
She likes to play rough.

41:34.263 --> 41:36.510
Reminds me of girl
I used to know.

41:39.107 --> 41:41.556
Man like you must've
put her in her place.

41:41.687 --> 41:44.417
Oh, no. She put me in mine.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.127
Didn't you...

41:47.290 --> 41:48.296
<i>diosa?</i>

41:54.282 --> 41:57.063
So that was
your game, huh?

41:57.369 --> 41:59.918
Follow the flesh
to Malvado's stronghold.

42:00.447 --> 42:03.518
You really think you can
find his hideout?

42:03.759 --> 42:06.125
Well, it was working
until you showed up.

42:10.299 --> 42:11.815
Where's the guy who
too you upstairs?

42:11.840 --> 42:12.764
With her.

42:16.355 --> 42:18.560
It wasn't until I actually saw her,

42:18.925 --> 42:21.825
saw how absolutely perfect she was,

42:22.488 --> 42:23.571
that I knew.

42:24.706 --> 42:27.640
Such a cruel and ugly thing
to do to a little girl.

42:40.621 --> 42:41.977
What the hell is that?

42:42.717 --> 42:44.340
Wrap this up.
Get 'em out of here.

43:13.955 --> 43:14.871
Come in.

43:19.919 --> 43:20.690
Hey.

43:24.618 --> 43:29.166
So there's some, uh, long-lost friends
of yours out by the dresser.

43:30.445 --> 43:31.713
Bunch of guys
named Benjamin.

43:31.738 --> 43:33.663
That squares us away,
then, huh?

43:35.427 --> 43:37.043
Yeah, yeah. Pretty much.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.398
Listen, one more thing, though.

43:40.849 --> 43:41.757
What's that?

43:42.046 --> 43:42.979
Thank you.

43:44.537 --> 43:47.297
I never said thank you for
pulling me out of that hole down south.

43:48.564 --> 43:49.603
You're welcome.

43:51.867 --> 43:52.659
Okay.

43:54.923 --> 43:55.776
Hey.

43:59.932 --> 44:01.413
What is it about us?

44:01.710 --> 44:02.628
What do you mean?

44:02.812 --> 44:04.175
I just feel like

44:05.148 --> 44:06.808
all we ever do
is say goodbye.

44:07.679 --> 44:10.601
Guess this doesn't have to be
the end. You know, it...

44:11.279 --> 44:13.357
could be the beginning of a...

44:14.435 --> 44:15.922
business arrangement.

44:51.961 --> 44:54.136
Hey, Sonja, listen, there's, uh...

44:56.000 --> 44:57.916
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

45:02.117 --> 45:03.061
What's wrong?

45:04.437 --> 45:05.520
What's wrong...

45:06.788 --> 45:08.293
is you're dead.
