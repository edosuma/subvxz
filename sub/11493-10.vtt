Well, I could, but you know,
since I've been single

You should totally get a yacht,

the difference

01:38.962 --> 01:41.162
between "organic beef"
and "grass-fed beef"?

01:41.164 --> 01:44.999
Yeah, "organic" is, uh, no
antibiotics or growth hormones,

01:45.001 --> 01:46.834
but it can still be
force-fed grain, which produces

01:46.836 --> 01:48.753
a less nutritious product
than cows that are allowed

01:48.755 --> 01:50.171
to naturally graze on grass.

I've got to
move on with my life.

09:45.531 --> 09:47.999
And this ring is just an anchor
chaining me to the past.

09:48.001 --> 09:49.083
Thanks, Al.

09:49.085 --> 09:51.753
Well, you are very welcome.
Enjoy your date!

09:51.755 --> 09:53.805
Will do. See you.

09:53.807 --> 09:55.706

10:05.228 --> 10:07.035
So the young man you were
with at the supermarket

10:07.036 --> 10:08.035
is no relation to you?

10:08.037 --> 10:09.921
Oh, no, Jake...
Mm.

10:09.923 --> 10:11.973
is Alan's son.

10:11.975 --> 10:14.309
And Alan is...?

10:14.311 --> 10:17.011
Uh, it's complicated.

10:17.846 --> 10:20.098
I'm fairly bright, try me.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.550
Okay.

10:22.552 --> 10:25.553
Um, when I tried to kill
myself in the ocean,

10:25.555 --> 10:28.189
Alan's house was
the closest one with a phone.

10:30.058 --> 10:31.326
I see.

10:31.328 --> 10:33.962
- You don't, do you?
- Not at all.

10:33.964 --> 10:36.781
- Okay, let me back up.
- Please do.

10:36.783 --> 10:40.118
Okay, when I was in high school,
I met this girl named Bridget.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.870
Is it really necessary to
back up quite that far?

10:42.872 --> 10:45.906
You're right, I'll skip ahead.

10:45.908 --> 10:48.926
Let's see... I got married
right after high school,

10:48.928 --> 10:50.244
happy, happy, happy.

10:50.246 --> 10:52.246
Made like a billion dollars,
rich, rich, rich.

10:52.248 --> 10:54.215
She decided she didn't
want to be married anymore,

10:54.217 --> 10:55.249
sad, sad, sad.

10:55.251 --> 10:56.684
In the ocean,
out of the ocean,

10:56.686 --> 11:00.021
bought Alan's house, got rid
of the furniture, kept Alan,

11:00.023 --> 11:03.641
got hungry, went to the
supermarket, met you. The end.

11:04.977 --> 11:06.728
Wow.

11:06.730 --> 11:08.313
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

11:08.315 --> 11:10.815
No, no, I have a few
follow-up questions.

11:10.817 --> 11:11.899
The furniture?

11:11.901 --> 11:13.368
The suicide.

11:13.370 --> 11:16.571
Oh, it was just a cry
for attention.

11:16.573 --> 11:18.406
I wanted Bridget
to feel sorry for me.

11:18.408 --> 11:20.825
Well, that's rather pathetic.

11:20.827 --> 11:23.044
In hindsight, yeah.

11:23.746 --> 11:25.279
And the billion dollars?

11:25.281 --> 11:27.999
I sold a couple companies
to Microsoft.

11:28.001 --> 11:29.167
Big mistake.

11:29.169 --> 11:30.585
Oh, you regret it?

11:30.587 --> 11:32.887
No, they do.

11:34.623 --> 11:36.474
How long's it been
since your wife left?

11:36.476 --> 11:40.595
Four months, three weeks,
four days, six hours and change.

11:41.647 --> 11:44.065
Let's just call it six hours.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.901
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

11:49.555 --> 11:51.105
You really <i>are</i> bright.

11:52.157 --> 11:53.875
I thought it was
just your accent.

11:53.877 --> 11:55.326
It kind of raises
the question,

11:55.328 --> 11:57.412
"Why on Earth did
you ask me out""

11:57.414 --> 11:58.746
Jake told me to.

11:58.748 --> 12:00.865
Alan's son.

12:00.867 --> 12:05.203
Yeah, and also wanted to because
I'm moving on with my life.

12:05.205 --> 12:06.504
See? Look, no wedding ring.

12:06.506 --> 12:08.673
Mmm, I noticed the
bright white tan line.

12:08.675 --> 12:11.092
Yeah, it's almost like
I still got it on.

12:11.094 --> 12:12.777
It is.

12:12.779 --> 12:14.712
No worries. I gave it to Alan.

12:14.714 --> 12:17.715
The man you kept
instead of furniture.

12:17.717 --> 12:20.134
Well, it wasn't an either/or.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.054
What about you?
What's your deal?

12:23.056 --> 12:25.440
My deal.

12:25.442 --> 12:27.024
All right, I'm a lawyer.

12:27.026 --> 12:28.726
Ugh! Ech!

12:30.846 --> 12:31.979
What else?

12:31.981 --> 12:34.649
Well, I'm divorced and I have

12:34.651 --> 12:36.701
a five-year-old daughter, Ava.

12:36.703 --> 12:38.152
I always wanted to have kids,

12:38.154 --> 12:40.354
but Bridget insisted
that we already had one.

12:40.356 --> 12:41.739
I don't follow.

12:41.741 --> 12:42.907
Me.

12:42.909 --> 12:45.526
Oh, sure, I can see that.
(chuckles)

12:48.414 --> 12:50.047
What do you think?

12:50.049 --> 12:52.383
Are we gonna fall in love
and stuff?

12:54.136 --> 12:55.386
What?

12:55.388 --> 12:58.306
'Cause that would really teach
Bridget a lesson.

13:02.027 --> 13:03.144
Hi, again.

13:03.146 --> 13:06.097
Oy gevalt.

13:06.099 --> 13:08.733
I, uh, brought something
else for you.

13:08.735 --> 13:12.403
My sphincter's tight
with anticipation.

13:12.405 --> 13:15.189

Whoa.

13:19.194 --> 13:22.229
Oh...

13:22.231 --> 13:23.998
very valuable.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.616
Did you steal it?

13:25.618 --> 13:27.018
What?

13:27.020 --> 13:31.873
I'm only asking because it
affects my marketing strategy.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.674
No, it was a gift.

13:33.676 --> 13:34.842

Give it away?

18:55.422 --> 18:57.839
Yeah, I think it's a bad idea
to lend people money.

18:57.841 --> 18:58.924
They never pay you back,

18:58.926 --> 19:00.676
and then you just end up
resenting them.

19:00.678 --> 19:01.843
So how much do you need?

19:01.845 --> 19:05.564
Uh...

19:05.566 --> 19:07.299
No, no, I can't, I can't
take your money.

19:07.301 --> 19:09.518
What, you're too proud?

19:09.520 --> 19:11.653
Oh, God, no, I-I-I
haven't had any pride

19:11.655 --> 19:14.940

19:14.942 --> 19:17.326
