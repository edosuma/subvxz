<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.375 --> 00:06.250
<i>Stardate 41386.4:</i>

00:06.250 --> 00:09.417
<i>We are in pursuit of a starship</i>

00:06.250 --> 00:09.417
<i>of Ferengi design.</i>

00:09.417 --> 00:11.417
<i>Our mission is</i>

00:09.417 --> 00:11.417
<i>to intercept and recover</i>

00:11.417 --> 00:13.875
<i>a T-9 energy converter</i>

00:11.417 --> 00:13.875
<i>which the Ferengi stole</i>

00:13.875 --> 00:15.834
<i>from an unmanned monitor post</i>

00:15.834 --> 00:17.375
<i>on Gamma Tauri IV</i>

00:17.375 --> 00:20.208
<i>a theft which automatic</i>

00:17.375 --> 00:20.208
<i>scanners recorded</i>

00:20.208 --> 00:22.333
<i>providing us with</i>

00:20.208 --> 00:22.333
<i>the long-awaited opportunity</i>

00:22.333 --> 00:24.875
<i>to make close contact</i>

00:22.333 --> 00:24.875
<i>with a Ferengi vessel.</i>

00:24.875 --> 00:27.208
<i>If we succeed in this chase</i>

00:27.208 --> 00:30.792
<i>it will be Starfleet's</i>

00:27.208 --> 00:30.792
<i>first look at a life-form</i>

00:30.792 --> 00:34.917
<i>which, discounting rumor,</i>

00:30.792 --> 00:34.917
<i>we know almost nothing about.</i>

00:34.917 --> 00:36.917
There she is.

00:40.375 --> 00:42.000
Enlarge.

00:45.959 --> 00:47.917
What is their course?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.959
They're now angling through

00:47.917 --> 00:50.959
that solar system, Captain.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.250
Identify.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.917
Listed as

00:52.250 --> 00:54.917
Delphi Ardu, sir--

00:54.917 --> 00:56.750
eleven planets,

00:54.917 --> 00:56.750
unexplored.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.667
Stay with them, La Forge.

00:58.667 --> 00:59.834
Aye, sir.

01:04.333 --> 01:05.542
Sensors read a power surge

01:05.542 --> 01:07.000
from their last maneuver,

01:05.542 --> 01:07.000
Captain.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.375
LA FORGE:

01:07.000 --> 01:11.375
They are dropping

01:07.000 --> 01:11.375
to sub-warp speed.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.959
Reduce to impulse power.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.083
Sensors record fluctuations

01:19.083 --> 01:21.166
in the energy readings from it,

01:19.083 --> 01:21.166
Captain.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.542
Possibility:

01:21.166 --> 01:23.542
a malfunction in

01:21.166 --> 01:23.542
their engines, sir.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.875
Breaks my heart.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.750
WORF:

01:24.875 --> 01:26.750
In visual range,

01:24.875 --> 01:26.750
Captain.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.333
Fully enlarge.

01:32.834 --> 01:35.083
Hello, stranger.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.125
Very impressive design.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.041
Anything on that

01:37.125 --> 01:39.041
design, Data?

01:39.041 --> 01:40.917
Nothing specific, sir.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.417
As you know,

01:40.917 --> 01:42.417
Ferengi technology

01:42.417 --> 01:44.917
is estimated to be

01:42.417 --> 01:44.917
generally equal

01:42.417 --> 01:44.917
to our own.

01:44.917 --> 01:47.750
PICARD:

01:44.917 --> 01:47.750
But that does not mean

01:44.917 --> 01:47.750
identical, however.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.166
Correct, sir.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.542
We are no doubt

01:49.166 --> 01:51.542
advanced in some areas--

01:51.542 --> 01:52.917
they in others.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.166
Showing another

01:52.917 --> 01:54.166
power surge, sir.

01:55.959 --> 01:58.750
They are firing on us!

01:58.750 --> 02:00.000
Damage report.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.208
YAR:

02:00.000 --> 02:01.208
Shields holding.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.917
Mostly electromagnetic.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.959
Fusion generator

02:02.917 --> 02:04.959
and batteries

02:04.959 --> 02:06.250
down by 30 percent.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.291
<i>Our</i> impulse engines

02:06.250 --> 02:08.291
are surging now.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.375
WORF:

02:08.291 --> 02:10.375
They're

02:08.291 --> 02:10.375
firing again.

02:12.208 --> 02:15.458
YAR:

02:12.208 --> 02:15.458
Deflector shield power

02:12.208 --> 02:15.458
weakening, Captain.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.166
Phasers ready.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.333
Photon torpedoes ready.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.000
Do we return their fire, sir?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.500
Negative,

02:25.000 --> 02:26.500
Number One.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.291
They're just responding

02:26.500 --> 02:29.291
to our close pursuit.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.959
Fall back a bit,

02:29.291 --> 02:31.959
but stay with them.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.458
They're slowing too, sir.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.458
They may be turning to fight.

02:48.583 --> 02:49.917
Open hailing frequen...

02:49.917 --> 02:52.208
Why are we gaining on them?

02:52.208 --> 02:53.709
Don't anticipate.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.250
LA FORGE:

02:53.709 --> 02:55.250
I'm not, sir.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.250
Something's wrong.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.750
DATA:

02:55.250 --> 02:56.750
Sir, something is

02:55.250 --> 02:56.750
dragging us forward.

02:58.959 --> 03:01.041
I read that, too.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.959
Lieutenant Yar, what

03:01.041 --> 03:03.959
do your sensors show?

03:03.959 --> 03:05.333
Not certain, sir.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.542
I'm getting

03:05.333 --> 03:07.542
very confusing readings.

03:07.542 --> 03:08.625
Captain...

03:08.625 --> 03:09.959
this shouldn't be.

03:09.959 --> 03:12.125
Our power systems

03:09.959 --> 03:12.125
are failing.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.291
YAR:

03:12.125 --> 03:14.291
Deflector

03:12.125 --> 03:14.291
shield failing.

03:14.291 --> 03:16.291
Phasers going inoperative,

03:14.291 --> 03:16.291
Captain.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.834
Captain, something is completely

03:16.291 --> 03:18.834
immobilizing us.

03:18.834 --> 03:22.333
Immobilized by the damn Ferengi!

03:22.333 --> 03:23.834
I need more

03:22.333 --> 03:23.834
information.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.208
What the hell

03:23.834 --> 03:26.208
are they using?

03:36.375 --> 03:38.458
Obviously, we've

03:36.375 --> 03:38.458
underestimated

03:38.458 --> 03:40.166
their technology,

03:38.458 --> 03:40.166
Captain.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.583
Considerably.

03:45.709 --> 03:48.709
It appears the Ferengi have us

03:45.709 --> 03:48.709
right where they want us--

03:48.709 --> 03:51.125
in<i> their</i> sights.

04:12.709 --> 04:16.583
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:16.583 --> 04:21.333
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:16.583 --> 04:21.333
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.583
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:23.583 --> 04:26.583
<i>to explore</i>

04:23.583 --> 04:26.583
<i>strange new worlds</i>

04:26.583 --> 04:31.625
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:26.583 --> 04:31.625
<i>and new civilizations</i>

04:31.625 --> 04:36.750
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:31.625 --> 04:36.750
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:45.750 --> 05:47.750
Are you searching

05:45.750 --> 05:47.750
all frequencies?

05:47.750 --> 05:49.000
Is there any sign

05:47.750 --> 05:49.000
of any message?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.250
Negative, sir.

05:52.583 --> 05:53.875
Weapons report, Lieutenant.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.750
I have phasers

05:53.875 --> 05:55.750
and torpedoes armed

05:55.750 --> 05:58.208
but I show insufficient power

05:55.750 --> 05:58.208
to fire them.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.834
Engineering, give me status

06:00.834 --> 06:02.333
on power recovery.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.125
Engineering, come in.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.125
Why aren't they

06:09.583 --> 06:11.125
answering?

06:12.166 --> 06:13.583
La Forge.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.583
Sir?

06:13.583 --> 06:15.250
Get me a full report

06:13.583 --> 06:15.250
from Engineering.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.000
Aye, sir.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
It's impossible

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
they could be draining

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
all power

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
from all systems.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.250
Counselor?

06:23.500 --> 06:25.750
I'm sensing nothing

06:23.500 --> 06:25.750
from them, sir.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.709
Which could mean

06:25.750 --> 06:27.709
they can shield

06:27.709 --> 06:30.208
their thoughts and emotions

06:27.709 --> 06:30.208
from others.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.959
Which still makes it

06:30.208 --> 06:31.959
our move.

06:31.959 --> 06:35.000
Sir, they may know as little

06:31.959 --> 06:35.000
about us as we do about them.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.083
Except that they know that

06:35.000 --> 06:38.083
they've got us in deep trouble.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.500
If so, then

06:38.083 --> 06:39.500
the question becomes

06:39.500 --> 06:41.667
what do they do

06:39.500 --> 06:41.667
with that knowledge?

06:41.667 --> 06:43.709
Data, do you have

06:41.667 --> 06:43.709
any information

06:43.709 --> 06:45.166
touching this on any file?

06:45.166 --> 06:46.458
None, sir.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.917
Only hearsay

06:46.458 --> 06:48.917
and third-hand reports

06:48.917 --> 06:50.291
most of which conflict.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.458
Which reports

06:50.291 --> 06:52.458
do not conflict?

06:52.458 --> 06:54.083
That the Ferengi are...

06:54.083 --> 06:57.458
Well, the best description

06:54.083 --> 06:57.458
may be "traders."

06:57.458 --> 06:59.417
What kind of traders?

06:59.417 --> 07:02.417
A comparison modern scholars

06:59.417 --> 07:02.417
have drawn from Earth history

07:02.417 --> 07:05.250
likens the Ferengi to

07:02.417 --> 07:05.250
the ocean-going Yankee traders

07:05.250 --> 07:07.667
of 18th and 19th century

07:05.250 --> 07:07.667
America, sir.

07:07.667 --> 07:10.500
From the history

07:07.667 --> 07:10.500
of my forebears--

07:07.667 --> 07:10.500
Yankee traders.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.458
Who in this case sail the<i> galaxy</i>

07:12.458 --> 07:15.500
in search of mercantile

07:12.458 --> 07:15.500
and territorial opportunity.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.542
And are these scholars

07:16.542 --> 07:17.834
saying that

07:16.542 --> 07:17.834
the Ferengi

07:17.834 --> 07:18.875
may not be unlike us?

07:18.875 --> 07:19.875
Hardly, sir.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.458
I believe the analogy refers

07:21.458 --> 07:23.291
to the worst quality

07:21.458 --> 07:23.291
of capitalists.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.458
The Ferengi are believed

07:24.458 --> 07:26.000
to conduct their affairs

07:24.458 --> 07:26.000
of commerce

07:26.000 --> 07:29.458
on the ancient principle,

07:26.000 --> 07:29.458
<i>caveat emptor--</i>

07:29.458 --> 07:31.667
"let the buyer beware."

07:31.667 --> 07:33.166
RIKER:

07:31.667 --> 07:33.166
Yankee traders--

07:33.166 --> 07:34.291
I like the sound of that.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.542
Well, sir...

07:35.542 --> 07:37.333
I doubt they wear

07:35.542 --> 07:37.333
red, white and blue

07:37.333 --> 07:38.834
or look anything like Uncle Sam.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.291
Engineering?

07:40.291 --> 07:42.333
Join La Forge down below

07:40.291 --> 07:42.333
in Engineering, Number One.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.792
Aye, sir.

07:43.792 --> 07:47.750
Without warp capacity,

07:43.792 --> 07:47.750
we're just a floating target.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.959
Uncle who?

07:51.875 --> 07:53.375
YAR:

07:51.875 --> 07:53.375
<i>What have bright</i>

07:53.375 --> 07:55.291
primary colors

07:53.375 --> 07:55.291
got to do with it?

07:55.291 --> 07:57.083
I understand the allusion.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.959
Colors representing countries

07:59.959 --> 08:02.041
at a time when they

07:59.959 --> 08:02.041
competed with each other.

08:02.041 --> 08:05.709
Red, white and blue

08:02.041 --> 08:05.709
for the United States

08:05.709 --> 08:09.417
whereas the French more properly

08:05.709 --> 08:09.417
used the same colors

08:09.417 --> 08:12.250
in the order

08:09.417 --> 08:12.250
of blue, white and red.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.959
And the German nation

08:12.250 --> 08:14.959
red, black and gold

08:14.959 --> 08:16.750
the Italians green, white

08:14.959 --> 08:16.750
and red; the British...

08:16.750 --> 08:17.875
That's enough, Data.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.166
It was you who...

08:19.166 --> 08:21.458
We were discussing

08:19.166 --> 08:21.458
the Ferengi.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.750
I wish I had some clue

08:23.750 --> 08:25.917
as to what they

08:23.750 --> 08:25.917
will do next.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.208
Given what is now happening

08:25.917 --> 08:28.208
to our ship, sir

08:28.208 --> 08:31.625
their weapons could be

08:28.208 --> 08:31.625
vastly superior to ours.

08:31.625 --> 08:35.625
Yes, Data, that is

08:31.625 --> 08:35.625
a natural assumption.

08:35.625 --> 08:39.208
Engineering?

08:39.208 --> 08:40.875
Bottom line, La Forge.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.500
Uh, it's not good, sir.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.959
The Ferengi force field

08:42.500 --> 08:44.959
that holds this ship

08:44.959 --> 08:47.250
compensates almost as fast

08:44.959 --> 08:47.250
as we can increase power.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.834
Almost?

08:48.834 --> 08:50.875
Well, there's a .372

08:48.834 --> 08:50.875
millisecond delay

08:50.875 --> 08:52.834
between the use

08:50.875 --> 08:52.834
of our power

08:52.834 --> 08:55.417
and the neutralizing counter

08:52.834 --> 08:55.417
force of the Ferengi.

08:55.417 --> 09:00.208
See, we push and they push back

08:55.417 --> 09:00.208
with equal force, sir.

09:10.166 --> 09:13.417
What's our acceleration delay

09:10.166 --> 09:13.417
between slow-reverse impulse

09:13.417 --> 09:15.291
and top warp speed?

09:15.291 --> 09:19.166
Well, that's .300 milliseconds,

09:15.291 --> 09:19.166
but there's...

09:19.166 --> 09:22.417
Ah, I see

09:19.166 --> 09:22.417
where you're going.

09:22.417 --> 09:25.417
We shift down then kick hard

09:22.417 --> 09:25.417
into warp nine.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.458
Yeah, come back

09:25.417 --> 09:27.458
fighting! Whoo-whee!

09:27.458 --> 09:28.625
Can we do it, Geordi?

09:28.625 --> 09:30.667
Ask me after

09:28.625 --> 09:30.667
it's done, sir.

09:30.667 --> 09:34.458
I want a slow reverse-engine

09:30.667 --> 09:34.458
drop-off over five minutes.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.041
We'll show them

09:34.458 --> 09:37.041
what this baby can do, sir.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.208
Give me everything

09:37.041 --> 09:39.208
you've got, La Forge.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.458
Aye, aye, sir.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.208
RIKER:

09:44.375 --> 09:48.208
Now a sudden abrupt power surge

09:44.375 --> 09:48.208
to high warp speed, Captain

09:48.208 --> 09:51.667
we may be able to break loose

09:48.208 --> 09:51.667
from that Ferengi force field.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.750
I wish I knew what they

09:51.667 --> 09:54.750
were thinking over there.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.834
They're wondering what

09:56.542 --> 09:58.834
we're going to do next.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.959
I say fight, sir.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.208
There's nothing shameful

10:03.208 --> 10:05.250
in falling

10:03.208 --> 10:05.250
before a superior enemy.

10:05.250 --> 10:09.166
And nothing shameful

10:05.250 --> 10:09.166
in a strategic retreat either.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.917
LA FORGE:

10:09.166 --> 10:10.917
All systems

10:09.166 --> 10:10.917
ready, Captain.

10:10.917 --> 10:13.333
And communication

10:10.917 --> 10:13.333
now restored to engineering.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.542
Excellent, La Forge.

10:15.542 --> 10:16.959
Now, let's uh...

10:16.959 --> 10:19.500
Let's throw them

10:16.959 --> 10:19.500
off guard.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.542
Lieutenant Yar,

10:19.500 --> 10:22.542
open hailing frequencies.

10:22.542 --> 10:26.041
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.250
At least we won't begin

10:26.041 --> 10:28.250
with weakness.

10:28.250 --> 10:31.625
Attention,

10:28.250 --> 10:31.625
Ferengi starship.

10:31.625 --> 10:35.291
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard

10:31.625 --> 10:35.291
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

10:35.291 --> 10:37.542
In the name of the United

10:35.291 --> 10:37.542
Federation of Planets

10:37.542 --> 10:40.542
I demand that you return

10:37.542 --> 10:40.542
the T-9 energy converter

10:40.542 --> 10:43.500
you removed from Gamma Tauri IV.

10:47.959 --> 10:50.667
Send that in all language forms.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.250
All language forms, sir.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.917
Sometimes, Riker

10:53.917 --> 10:55.750
the best way to fight

10:53.917 --> 10:55.750
is not to be there.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.291
Yes, sir.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.583
"He will triumph

10:57.291 --> 10:59.583
who knows when to fight

10:59.583 --> 11:01.667
and when not to fight."

11:01.667 --> 11:03.542
I'm glad the Academy

11:01.667 --> 11:03.542
is still teaching

11:03.542 --> 11:05.291
the strategies of Sun Tzu.

11:05.291 --> 11:08.250
This delay had better

11:05.291 --> 11:08.250
prove out, La Forge.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.583
.300 milliseconds, sir.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.959
Let's blast full power

11:10.583 --> 11:12.959
into warp nine.

11:12.959 --> 11:14.208
Ready?

11:14.208 --> 11:15.709
On your command, Captain.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.166
On the count of three.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.959
Stand by on phasers.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.959
One-- set warp to nine.

11:22.959 --> 11:27.667
Two-- divert shield power

11:22.959 --> 11:27.667
to main engines.

11:27.667 --> 11:28.917
Three.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.291
<i>Merde.</i>

11:52.291 --> 11:53.542
Shields up.

12:03.083 --> 12:06.125
Captain, I think

12:03.083 --> 12:06.125
you had better see this.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.500
What's wrong?

12:08.500 --> 12:10.333
Someone is reading

12:08.500 --> 12:10.333
every file

12:10.333 --> 12:12.041
every bit of information

12:12.041 --> 12:13.792
stored in the<i> Enterprise</i>

12:12.041 --> 12:13.792
memory banks.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.417
They can do that?

12:15.417 --> 12:17.542
And more, perhaps.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.709
Captain.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.667
If I may

12:23.709 --> 12:25.667
recommend.

12:25.667 --> 12:29.041
With our attention

12:25.667 --> 12:29.041
on the Ferengi vessel

12:29.041 --> 12:31.250
we have ignored the planet.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.583
Data, consult the charts

12:31.250 --> 12:34.583
on this planet.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.291
See what we've got on it.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.750
Conference evaluation.

12:48.125 --> 12:49.709
So, while we still have

12:48.125 --> 12:49.709
some power left

12:49.709 --> 12:51.375
it's time

12:49.709 --> 12:51.375
for difficult decisions.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.166
Opinions, please?

12:53.166 --> 12:55.417
I say put all available power

12:53.166 --> 12:55.417
into a full-out, combined phaser

12:55.417 --> 12:57.166
and photon torpedo salvo.

12:57.166 --> 13:00.083
Destroy their ability to sustain

12:57.166 --> 13:00.083
this force field, sir.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.125
Yes!

13:01.125 --> 13:02.834
Hit them hard and hit them fast.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.417
Impractical.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.000
And provocative.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.166
Even assuming that we have the

13:07.000 --> 13:11.166
power to sustain such a tactic.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.458
But, Captain, isn't firing on us

13:11.166 --> 13:13.458
an act of war?

13:13.458 --> 13:15.917
TROI:

13:13.458 --> 13:15.917
The facts are the Ferengi

13:13.458 --> 13:15.917
did fire on us

13:15.917 --> 13:18.208
but we were

13:15.917 --> 13:18.208
chasing them.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.792
Since then, all they've done

13:18.208 --> 13:20.792
is search our computers

13:20.792 --> 13:22.792
trying to learn

13:20.792 --> 13:22.792
who and what we are.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.083
Your point, Counselor?

13:24.083 --> 13:25.458
Let's talk to them.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.208
It's been tried.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.208
No response.

13:27.208 --> 13:31.458
But did we tell them

13:27.208 --> 13:31.458
anything they wanted to hear?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.458
La Forge?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.291
Other opinions?

13:47.291 --> 13:49.458
Thank you for your advice.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.083
PICARD:

13:53.875 --> 13:56.083
Will...

13:56.083 --> 13:59.208
I haven't heard your assessment.

14:00.959 --> 14:03.917
I believe we've covered

14:00.959 --> 14:03.917
every available option, Captain.

14:03.917 --> 14:07.125
Are there other options

14:03.917 --> 14:07.125
that you want to analyze?

14:07.125 --> 14:09.417
The only one remaining

14:09.417 --> 14:11.875
is the one that needs

14:09.417 --> 14:11.875
no conversation--

14:11.875 --> 14:13.709
the one we must avoid.

14:13.709 --> 14:15.500
Sir?

14:15.500 --> 14:18.834
The one that leads

14:15.500 --> 14:18.834
to total annihilation.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.792
Open hailing

14:34.792 --> 14:36.792
frequencies.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.375
DATA:

14:36.792 --> 14:38.375
Open, sir.

14:41.542 --> 14:43.208
Attention, Ferengi starship.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.083
This is Captain Picard.

14:45.083 --> 14:48.750
It is obvious that

14:45.083 --> 14:48.750
we are in a situation here

14:48.750 --> 14:51.166
which needs resolving

14:51.166 --> 14:56.750
and we are willing to do

14:51.166 --> 14:56.750
whatever is... required.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.875
Whatever is necessary.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.166
I would like...

15:05.166 --> 15:08.500
I would request

15:08.500 --> 15:11.667
that you present

15:08.500 --> 15:11.667
your terms to us.

15:22.834 --> 15:26.834
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

15:22.834 --> 15:26.834
<i>Stardate 41386.5:</i>

15:26.834 --> 15:29.083
<i>It is with a heavy heart</i>

15:29.083 --> 15:30.792
<i>that I have offered to meet</i>

15:30.792 --> 15:33.792
<i>whatever reasonable and</i>

15:30.792 --> 15:33.792
<i>necessary terms are demanded</i>

15:33.792 --> 15:35.417
<i>by the Ferengi.</i>

15:35.417 --> 15:37.583
<i>I fear for my people</i>

15:35.417 --> 15:37.583
<i>and my vessel in the event</i>

15:37.583 --> 15:41.000
<i>the unknown Ferengi</i>

15:37.583 --> 15:41.000
<i>ask the unreasonable.</i>

15:41.000 --> 15:44.542
<i>How can I oppose</i>

15:41.000 --> 15:44.542
<i>even unreasonable demands?</i>

15:44.542 --> 15:46.250
It's moving, sir.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.333
WORF:

15:48.333 --> 15:50.333
We ask to

15:48.333 --> 15:50.333
surrender

15:50.333 --> 15:51.709
and<i> now</i> they

15:50.333 --> 15:51.709
fire on us?

15:51.709 --> 15:53.208
Ready torpedoes, sir.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.250
We have enough power

15:53.208 --> 15:55.250
for a few of them.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.417
Ready.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.208
But hold on ready.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.041
Open hailing frequencies.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.250
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

16:04.291 --> 16:07.125
Ferengi vessel,

16:04.291 --> 16:07.125
we await your response.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.834
Suggest first strike, sir.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.750
Our shields now only have

16:08.834 --> 16:10.750
63 seconds

16:10.750 --> 16:12.417
of power left before lowering.

16:12.417 --> 16:15.083
WORF:

16:12.417 --> 16:15.083
If the Ferengis' ship

16:12.417 --> 16:15.083
sensors can read us, sir

16:15.083 --> 16:17.250
they will be waiting until

16:15.083 --> 16:17.250
we are most vulnerable.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.333
I'm afraid I agree, Captain;

16:17.250 --> 16:19.333
they have not responded...

16:19.333 --> 16:21.500
We will wait a bit more,

16:19.333 --> 16:21.500
Number One.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.750
50 Seconds.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.125
Patience.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.542
Patience.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.625
The quicker we can come

16:29.208 --> 16:31.625
to terms

16:31.625 --> 16:34.750
the better, NCC 1701-D.

16:36.208 --> 16:37.583
Who is speaking?

16:37.583 --> 16:42.792
I am Tarr,

16:37.583 --> 16:42.792
Daimon of the Ferengi.

16:42.792 --> 16:45.542
You wished to discuss surrender,

16:42.792 --> 16:45.542
Captain Picard?

16:45.542 --> 16:47.750
What I said, Daimon Tarr, is...

16:47.750 --> 16:51.917
Unconditional surrender,

16:47.750 --> 16:51.917
I warn you

16:51.917 --> 16:55.291
is totally unacceptable.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.709
We will die

16:55.291 --> 16:57.709
to the last one of us

16:57.709 --> 16:59.542
before such dishonor.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.166
Hailing frequencies

17:04.500 --> 17:06.166
closed, sir.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.375
Something has seized

17:06.166 --> 17:08.375
their ship, too.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.792
They're in the same

17:08.375 --> 17:10.792
predicament as us.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.583
Launch a sensor probe.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.041
Set it to search

17:12.583 --> 17:15.041
for the source of...

17:15.041 --> 17:18.125
whatever this "something" is

17:15.041 --> 17:18.125
that is holding both ships.

17:18.125 --> 17:21.166
Go back

17:18.125 --> 17:21.166
to hailing frequency, fast.

17:21.166 --> 17:26.208
...and I regret, Daimon Tarr,

17:21.166 --> 17:26.208
that I can no longer negotiate

17:26.208 --> 17:29.583
unless it is conducted visually.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.750
Your complete message

17:29.583 --> 17:31.750
not received,<i> Enterprise</i>

17:31.750 --> 17:35.250
but visual communication

17:31.750 --> 17:35.250
is against our custom.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.291
And it is against

17:35.250 --> 17:37.291
Starfleet orders

17:37.291 --> 17:38.959
to accept

17:37.291 --> 17:38.959
a surrender otherwise.

17:38.959 --> 17:41.709
Do you withdraw

17:38.959 --> 17:41.709
your surrender?

17:48.291 --> 17:51.000
You give us

17:48.291 --> 17:51.000
no choice,<i> Enterprise.</i>

17:51.000 --> 17:54.041
May we have

17:51.000 --> 17:54.041
a visual on you, as well?

17:55.458 --> 17:57.959
Agreed, Daimon Tarr.

17:57.959 --> 18:00.000
You should be able

17:57.959 --> 18:00.000
to view us now.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.583
Are we on your screen?

18:01.583 --> 18:05.500
Yes, the ugliness of the hu-man

18:01.583 --> 18:05.500
was not an exaggeration.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.792
I do not know how

18:05.500 --> 18:08.792
your twisted alien culture

18:08.792 --> 18:10.250
has paralyzed our vessel

18:10.250 --> 18:13.000
but I concede

18:10.250 --> 18:13.000
your<i> Enterprise</i> is superior.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.291
We will return

18:13.000 --> 18:15.291
your worthless T-9 device

18:15.291 --> 18:17.125
and we offer the lives

18:15.291 --> 18:17.125
of our second officers

18:17.125 --> 18:20.709
as required by the Ferengi code.

18:20.709 --> 18:22.792
Fortunately, Starfleet

18:20.709 --> 18:22.792
has no such rules

18:22.792 --> 18:24.959
involving its second officers.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.250
Is this to your satisfaction

18:26.500 --> 18:29.250
Picard Captain?

18:29.250 --> 18:31.291
Your offer may be inadequate

18:31.291 --> 18:34.125
but I will discuss it

18:31.291 --> 18:34.125
with my staff.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.959
Stand by

18:34.125 --> 18:35.959
for further communication.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.125
Matthew! Pola!

18:43.125 --> 18:44.959
You know this area

18:43.125 --> 18:44.959
is off-limits!

18:44.959 --> 18:46.959
Come on, come on!

18:46.959 --> 18:49.000
Boys will be boys, Captain.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.750
Lieutenant, have you

18:49.000 --> 18:50.750
launched the probe?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.083
Aye, sir.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.041
We should be getting

18:52.083 --> 18:54.041
those readings soon.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.417
If we're not

18:54.041 --> 18:55.417
holding the Ferengi

18:55.417 --> 18:57.417
and they're not holding us,

18:55.417 --> 18:57.417
who the hell is?

18:57.417 --> 19:00.000
Well, the probe will give us

18:57.417 --> 19:00.000
some of those answers, sir.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.000
Data!

19:03.000 --> 19:04.583
You were going

19:03.000 --> 19:04.583
to show us something.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.333
As requested, Captain

19:06.333 --> 19:09.709
library computer information

19:06.333 --> 19:09.709
on this planet.

19:09.709 --> 19:13.417
It has been charted

19:09.709 --> 19:13.417
only from long-range scans.

19:13.417 --> 19:15.000
It is class "M"

19:15.000 --> 19:16.750
but shows no indication

19:15.000 --> 19:16.750
of life-forms--

19:16.750 --> 19:18.041
sentient or otherwise.

19:18.041 --> 19:21.375
However, you may find

19:18.041 --> 19:21.375
this of interest.

19:21.375 --> 19:25.166
Resolving it

19:21.375 --> 19:25.166
into our language.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.542
The center

19:25.166 --> 19:27.542
of a huge space federation--

19:27.542 --> 19:29.917
a population of trillions.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.375
Trillions?

19:31.375 --> 19:34.667
I've never heard

19:31.375 --> 19:34.667
the word "Tkon" before.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.166
Understandable.

19:36.166 --> 19:39.750
It has been extinct

19:36.166 --> 19:39.750
for 600,000 of our...

19:41.750 --> 19:43.458
of our years.

19:44.834 --> 19:46.166
These...

19:46.166 --> 19:48.667
these planets

19:46.166 --> 19:48.667
were once...

19:48.667 --> 19:50.000
outposts...

19:50.000 --> 19:51.750
of that empire...

19:51.750 --> 19:53.458
Data, what are you doing?

19:53.458 --> 19:56.083
Apologies, Captain.

19:56.083 --> 20:01.667
I seem to have reached

19:56.083 --> 20:01.667
an odd functional impasse.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.542
I am, uh...

20:04.667 --> 20:06.333
...stuck.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.709
Then get unstuck

20:06.333 --> 20:08.709
and continue with the briefing.

20:08.709 --> 20:09.959
Yes, sir.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.917
That is what

20:09.959 --> 20:11.917
I'm trying to do, sir

20:11.917 --> 20:15.709
but the solution eludes me.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.250
My hero.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.500
(<i> laughter</i> )

20:23.542 --> 20:24.750
Continue, Commander.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.291
Intriguing.

20:29.291 --> 20:31.166
It...

20:31.166 --> 20:32.792
it describes

20:31.166 --> 20:32.792
the empire

20:32.792 --> 20:36.083
as being highly advanced

20:32.792 --> 20:36.083
and powerful

20:36.083 --> 20:38.625
and capable

20:36.083 --> 20:38.625
of actually moving stars.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.417
Stars whose planets

20:38.625 --> 20:41.417
are their defense system.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.542
Correct, sir.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.917
Outposts.

20:43.917 --> 20:46.166
The planet below

20:43.917 --> 20:46.166
was possibly one of them.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.875
YAR:

20:46.166 --> 20:47.875
Excuse the interruption,

20:46.166 --> 20:47.875
Captain

20:47.875 --> 20:49.875
but this may be worth it.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.625
We're now receiving

20:49.875 --> 20:52.625
a signal from the probe.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.583
We'll take it here.

20:55.959 --> 20:57.625
(<i> low whistle</i> )

20:57.625 --> 20:59.041
Incredible!

20:59.041 --> 21:01.834
There's our mysterious

20:59.041 --> 21:01.834
"something," Captain.

21:01.834 --> 21:04.709
It is a force field

21:01.834 --> 21:04.709
of some kind.

21:04.709 --> 21:07.500
Reaching up from

21:04.709 --> 21:07.500
the planet's surface.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.709
Amazing power.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.458
Data, what does

21:08.709 --> 21:10.458
the legend say

21:10.458 --> 21:12.291
about the end

21:10.458 --> 21:12.291
of the Tkon empire?

21:12.291 --> 21:14.166
Their sun went supernova, sir.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.959
Could this planet

21:14.166 --> 21:16.959
have escaped that?

21:16.959 --> 21:20.875
This planet may have been

21:16.959 --> 21:20.875
the most distant outpost, sir

21:20.875 --> 21:23.250
but it shows

21:20.875 --> 21:23.250
no life-form readings.

21:23.250 --> 21:27.208
We should take a look at it,

21:23.250 --> 21:27.208
Number One.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.375
Stand by with an away team.

21:28.375 --> 21:29.834
RIKER:

21:28.375 --> 21:29.834
And if the Ferengi

21:29.834 --> 21:31.709
also realize

21:29.834 --> 21:31.709
that the force field

21:31.709 --> 21:32.875
emanates

21:31.709 --> 21:32.875
from the planet, sir?

21:32.875 --> 21:34.250
Mmm. That's a complication.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.875
Maybe we should ask them

21:34.250 --> 21:36.875
to join us in this.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.875
Team up with

21:36.875 --> 21:38.875
the Ferengi, sir?

21:38.875 --> 21:41.208
We've been ordered

21:38.875 --> 21:41.208
to learn all we can about them.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.917
Do you know a better way?

21:45.709 --> 21:46.875
Data.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.458
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

21:57.458 --> 22:00.875
<i>In orbit of a mysterious planet</i>

21:57.458 --> 22:00.875
<i>whose unexplained force field</i>

22:00.875 --> 22:05.000
<i>has seized us with a power</i>

22:00.875 --> 22:05.000
<i>almost beyond imagination.</i>

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
<i>If there is a solution to this</i>

22:07.000 --> 22:09.667
it almost certainly will involve

22:07.000 --> 22:09.667
<i>cooperation from the Ferengi.</i>

22:09.667 --> 22:12.458
Ship's power drain

22:09.667 --> 22:12.458
is critical, Captain.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.875
I must now shut down

22:12.458 --> 22:14.875
our shields

22:14.875 --> 22:17.000
to maintain

22:14.875 --> 22:17.000
life-support systems.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.500
Understood.

22:19.542 --> 22:22.667
Open hailing frequencies.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.667
Hailing frequencies

22:22.667 --> 22:24.667
open, sir.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.500
Ferengi vessel

22:24.667 --> 22:26.500
from<i> Enterprise.</i>

22:26.500 --> 22:27.834
Come in.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.041
Your alien images

22:31.083 --> 22:33.041
again shock us.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.750
With regard to

22:33.041 --> 22:34.750
the surrender

22:34.750 --> 22:37.125
Daimon Tarr, the facts are

22:34.750 --> 22:37.125
somewhat different.

22:37.125 --> 22:40.542
Our own probe has already shown

22:37.125 --> 22:40.542
us your trickery, hu-man.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.750
We withdraw our surrender.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.375
Agreed.

22:44.375 --> 22:48.625
Perhaps you would agree to

22:44.375 --> 22:48.625
a more productive relationship.

22:48.625 --> 22:51.750
I prefer

22:48.625 --> 22:51.750
a more profitable one, hu-man.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.083
Yankee trader.

22:53.083 --> 22:55.959
Explain what means

22:53.083 --> 22:55.959
"Yankee traders."

22:55.959 --> 22:57.291
He heard that?!

22:57.291 --> 23:00.291
He recognizes

22:57.291 --> 23:00.291
your interest in profit...

23:00.291 --> 23:03.083
or is that

23:00.291 --> 23:03.083
an incorrect assumption?

23:03.083 --> 23:04.750
We seek only what is equitable.

23:04.750 --> 23:05.959
What do you seek?

23:05.959 --> 23:07.875
Why did you begin

23:05.959 --> 23:07.875
by attacking us?

23:07.875 --> 23:09.125
We did not attack you.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.959
We gave chase

23:09.125 --> 23:10.959
in order to recover

23:10.959 --> 23:12.667
a Federation-owned

23:10.959 --> 23:12.667
energy device...

23:12.667 --> 23:14.375
Which we know is ours!

23:14.375 --> 23:17.125
Your barbarous Federation

23:14.375 --> 23:17.125
placed it on one of our planets.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.709
On the contrary--

23:18.709 --> 23:22.041
Gamma Tauri IV is recognized

23:18.709 --> 23:22.041
by all civilized...

23:22.041 --> 23:24.625
The Ferengi

23:22.041 --> 23:24.625
are not uncivilized, hu-man!

23:24.625 --> 23:26.417
Are you suggesting otherwise?

23:26.417 --> 23:30.208
All I'm saying is that you

23:26.417 --> 23:30.208
removed something

23:30.208 --> 23:33.709
which clearly did not

23:30.208 --> 23:33.709
belong to you.

23:33.709 --> 23:36.458
Are you now calling us thieves?

23:36.458 --> 23:38.125
On the contrary.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.583
I have no wish to discuss issues

23:38.125 --> 23:40.583
of property or of territory

23:40.583 --> 23:42.333
while our mutual

23:40.583 --> 23:42.333
problem remains.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.917
Like it or not

23:43.917 --> 23:45.583
we are both trapped

23:45.583 --> 23:50.041
by this energy-draining

23:45.583 --> 23:50.041
force field from the planet.

23:52.041 --> 23:57.875
On that matter,

23:52.041 --> 23:57.875
there can be no argument.

23:57.875 --> 24:01.000
I would like to propose a swap.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.125
And what is a "swap"?

24:03.125 --> 24:04.625
It's a trade--

24:04.625 --> 24:05.959
an exchange.

24:05.959 --> 24:07.375
Yes, trade, hu-man.

24:07.375 --> 24:08.875
What do you offer?

24:08.875 --> 24:11.000
We will tell you what

24:08.875 --> 24:11.000
we know about the planet

24:11.000 --> 24:14.542
and in trade, you will

24:11.000 --> 24:14.542
give us your information.

24:14.542 --> 24:15.792
Ridiculous! How do we know

24:15.792 --> 24:17.750
you will not withhold

24:15.792 --> 24:17.750
information.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.500
We must trust each other, Tarr.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.625
(<i> laughs</i> )

24:20.625 --> 24:22.083
Amusing, hu-man.

24:22.083 --> 24:23.917
"Trust" each other?

24:23.917 --> 24:27.709
I propose that we test

24:23.917 --> 24:27.709
this relationship

24:27.709 --> 24:30.709
by cooperating

24:27.709 --> 24:30.709
in a joint exploration

24:30.709 --> 24:32.458
of the planet's surface.

24:32.458 --> 24:35.250
And what profit

24:32.458 --> 24:35.250
is in this Picard Captain?

24:35.250 --> 24:38.792
The profit, Daimon Tarr,

24:35.250 --> 24:38.792
of saving all our lives.

24:38.792 --> 24:42.000
We will agree,

24:38.792 --> 24:42.000
no doubt foolishly

24:42.000 --> 24:44.291
but you are warned that any

24:42.000 --> 24:44.291
further trickery on your part

24:44.291 --> 24:45.792
will be met with no mercy.

24:45.792 --> 24:46.875
Agreed.

24:46.875 --> 24:48.333
If you care to join us

24:48.333 --> 24:50.250
we have a well-proven

24:48.333 --> 24:50.250
transporter device...

24:50.250 --> 24:52.458
We have a matter-energy

24:50.250 --> 24:52.458
device of our own.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.417
We will beam a science

24:52.458 --> 24:54.417
team of three

24:54.417 --> 24:56.291
to whatever coordinates

24:54.417 --> 24:56.291
you propose.

24:56.291 --> 24:59.041
Excellent, we will transmit

24:56.291 --> 24:59.041
the information shortly.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.917
<i>Enterprise</i> out.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.458
Hailing frequencies off.

25:05.083 --> 25:09.166
I would log that agreement

25:05.083 --> 25:09.166
as promising, at least.

25:09.166 --> 25:10.583
I wonder, Captain.

25:10.583 --> 25:13.375
I'm not usually one for

25:10.583 --> 25:13.375
distrust at first sight

25:13.375 --> 25:15.166
but this may be

25:13.375 --> 25:15.166
an exception.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.291
Especially in view

25:15.166 --> 25:16.291
of the fact

25:16.291 --> 25:17.875
that the image he

25:16.291 --> 25:17.875
transmitted, sir

25:17.875 --> 25:19.291
was somehow

25:17.875 --> 25:19.291
distorted.

25:19.291 --> 25:21.291
I sense

25:19.291 --> 25:21.291
the same thing, Captain.

25:21.291 --> 25:23.458
He's hiding something.

25:23.458 --> 25:25.000
With this power drain,

25:23.458 --> 25:25.000
we can't delay.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.291
Now, I'd like some

25:25.000 --> 25:26.291
additional help

25:26.291 --> 25:27.500
in case we run

25:26.291 --> 25:27.500
into trouble.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.583
Can you spare Worf?

25:28.583 --> 25:29.625
Take him.

25:29.625 --> 25:33.291
And be careful, Number One.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.083
DATA:

25:45.250 --> 25:47.083
With this power drain

25:45.250 --> 25:47.083
we may have trouble

25:47.083 --> 25:48.875
communicating with

25:47.083 --> 25:48.875
the<i> Enterprise,</i> sir.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.875
Understood.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.875
Anything else?

25:50.875 --> 25:52.333
Due to this

25:50.875 --> 25:52.333
force field

25:52.333 --> 25:54.417
there is presently

25:52.333 --> 25:54.417
no way to beam us back, sir.

25:54.417 --> 25:55.709
Oh, you had to ask.

25:55.709 --> 25:57.125
Understood.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.250
Energize.

26:03.959 --> 26:07.417
(<i> explosive thunder</i> )

26:27.583 --> 26:29.458
Tasha!

26:29.458 --> 26:31.166
Data!

26:31.166 --> 26:33.625
Geordi!

26:33.625 --> 26:35.250
Worf!

26:49.959 --> 26:52.458
Anybody!

27:04.250 --> 27:05.792
Data?

27:14.542 --> 27:16.625
What are you

27:14.542 --> 27:16.625
doing up there?

27:16.625 --> 27:18.583
Most intriguing, sir.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.375
I assume a problem

27:18.583 --> 27:20.375
of inaccurately

27:20.375 --> 27:21.875
transmitted program

27:20.375 --> 27:21.875
coordinates

27:21.875 --> 27:24.250
due to the force field

27:21.875 --> 27:24.250
around the ship, sir.

27:28.917 --> 27:30.375
Are we alone, sir?

27:30.375 --> 27:31.875
Unfortunately.

27:31.875 --> 27:33.125
Let's find the others.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.000
What do you make of these?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.875
Crystalline.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.208
Mostly inert.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.500
Nothing to write home about.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.041
Excuse me?

27:51.041 --> 27:52.625
Slang, sir.

27:52.625 --> 27:56.625
I did use it

27:52.625 --> 27:56.625
correctly, did I not?

27:58.834 --> 28:01.625
They've got to be around here

27:58.834 --> 28:01.625
somewhere.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.208
What's that?

28:12.208 --> 28:13.417
What?

28:13.417 --> 28:14.583
That!

28:14.583 --> 28:16.000
Geordi!

28:20.083 --> 28:22.625
Are you conscious?

28:22.625 --> 28:24.250
Do I look conscious?

28:24.250 --> 28:25.375
What are you doing?

28:25.375 --> 28:26.750
I'm resting, sir.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.417
My foot stuck--

28:28.417 --> 28:29.500
up there!

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
I materialized

28:29.500 --> 28:31.500
upside down

28:31.500 --> 28:33.375
above the planet surface.

28:33.375 --> 28:34.792
DATA:

28:33.375 --> 28:34.792
Tricorder's

28:33.375 --> 28:34.792
useless, sir.

28:34.792 --> 28:36.500
Communication's

28:34.792 --> 28:36.500
gone, too.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.750
Fortunately, you

28:36.500 --> 28:38.750
did not break...

28:38.750 --> 28:39.834
Data?

28:39.834 --> 28:41.208
Hmm?

28:41.208 --> 28:42.458
Data, who's that?

28:47.208 --> 28:49.125
Who are you?

29:13.250 --> 29:15.333
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

29:15.333 --> 29:17.917
<i>It is now six hours since</i>

29:15.333 --> 29:17.917
<i>our away team beamed down</i>

29:17.917 --> 29:19.875

29:19.875 --> 29:21.417
<i>On the</i> Enterprise

29:21.417 --> 29:23.291
<i>our condition</i>

29:21.417 --> 29:23.291
<i>is rapidly worsening.</i>

29:23.291 --> 29:26.000
<i>Ordinarily,</i>

29:23.291 --> 29:26.000
<i>with reserve power alone</i>

29:26.000 --> 29:29.333
<i>we could maintain life support</i>

29:26.000 --> 29:29.333
<i>for several months</i>

29:29.333 --> 29:32.458
<i>but the force holding us</i>

29:29.333 --> 29:32.458
<i>has closed down all engines</i>

29:32.458 --> 29:35.834
<i>and is draining</i>

29:32.458 --> 29:35.834
<i>our reserve power, too.</i>

29:35.834 --> 29:38.041
It's getting much,

29:35.834 --> 29:38.041
much, much colder, sir.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.083
How far down is

29:38.041 --> 29:40.083
it likely to go?

29:40.083 --> 29:41.250
A lot.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.458
Even in orbital space

29:42.458 --> 29:44.375
it'll get below

29:42.458 --> 29:44.375
minus 200 degrees.

29:44.375 --> 29:47.166
We won't have to worry much

29:44.375 --> 29:47.166
past minus 70 or so.

29:47.166 --> 29:48.792
Feels like that now.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.458
Good, thank you.

30:24.083 --> 30:27.709
LETEK:

30:24.083 --> 30:27.709
If he moves,

30:24.083 --> 30:27.709
kill him.

30:29.542 --> 30:31.583
Has what

30:29.542 --> 30:31.583
we've done

30:31.583 --> 30:34.417
broken our agreement

30:31.583 --> 30:34.417
with their Captain?

30:34.417 --> 30:36.542
We will accuse

30:34.417 --> 30:36.542
the humans

30:36.542 --> 30:39.417
of preparing

30:36.542 --> 30:39.417
to ambush us.

30:39.417 --> 30:44.625
It will be our word

30:39.417 --> 30:44.625
against theirs.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.625
And who is more

30:44.625 --> 30:47.625
trustworthy, Mordoc?

30:49.125 --> 30:51.458
It looks like gold.

30:53.709 --> 30:55.667
Tastes like gold.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.375
RIKER:

30:55.667 --> 30:57.375
It is gold.

30:57.375 --> 31:00.375
(<i> thunder crashing loudly</i> )

31:00.375 --> 31:01.917
(<i> screams</i> )

31:02.834 --> 31:04.792
(<i> screams</i> )

31:04.792 --> 31:06.291
Accursed planet.

31:06.291 --> 31:08.166
It's nothing compared

31:06.291 --> 31:08.166
to what our Captain will do

31:08.166 --> 31:10.792
when he finds out you've broken

31:08.166 --> 31:10.792
our landing party agreement.

31:10.792 --> 31:13.500
What part of

31:10.792 --> 31:13.500
the agreement?

31:13.500 --> 31:16.625
You appeared and

31:13.500 --> 31:16.625
attacked<i> us.</i>

31:16.625 --> 31:19.375
Are you one

31:16.625 --> 31:19.375
of their assassins?

31:19.375 --> 31:21.750
I am Commander William Riker,

31:19.375 --> 31:21.750
First Officer

31:21.750 --> 31:23.500
of the USS

31:21.750 --> 31:23.500
<i>Enterprise.</i>

31:23.500 --> 31:25.625
You have a lot

31:23.500 --> 31:25.625
to learn.

31:34.625 --> 31:36.375
I've got this one!

31:36.375 --> 31:38.166
Careful, Commander,

31:36.375 --> 31:38.166
they're much stronger than...

31:41.500 --> 31:43.750
Pygmy cretins!

31:50.834 --> 31:52.000
Kill them.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.417
Hideous monsters!

31:54.417 --> 31:55.959
No!

31:57.417 --> 31:58.834
Good.

31:58.834 --> 32:02.083
You've heard

31:58.834 --> 32:02.083
of phasers.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.834
Now, over there.

32:06.709 --> 32:09.583
Is this a female?

32:09.583 --> 32:13.667
A human female, Letek?

32:13.667 --> 32:16.125
It is true.

32:16.125 --> 32:19.500
You work with your females

32:19.500 --> 32:24.875
arm them and force them

32:19.500 --> 32:24.875
to wear clothing.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.500
Sickening.

32:32.542 --> 32:35.667
I've diverted

32:32.542 --> 32:35.667
the reserve power

32:35.667 --> 32:38.125
down here to

32:35.667 --> 32:38.125
the family decks.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.041
They'll last longest.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.458
Is there anything else

32:43.500 --> 32:46.458
we can do, Doctor?

32:50.500 --> 32:52.125
Where is Wesley?

32:52.125 --> 32:54.667
He's in our quarters.

32:54.667 --> 32:59.208
I was tempted

32:54.667 --> 32:59.208
to give him a sedative.

32:59.208 --> 33:00.792
You shouldn't.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.000
I know, but he's my son.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.583
I love him.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.542
He has the right

33:04.583 --> 33:07.542
to meet death awake.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.709
Is that a male perspective?

33:15.625 --> 33:16.959
Rubbish.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.458
Hold it right there.

33:23.542 --> 33:24.792
YAR:

33:23.542 --> 33:24.792
Stop.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.500
Stop!

33:26.500 --> 33:27.792
Phasers on stun.

33:27.792 --> 33:29.291
Already set.

33:33.291 --> 33:35.250
What's going on?

33:41.667 --> 33:44.375
What is this?

33:47.917 --> 33:49.875
I believe

33:47.917 --> 33:49.875
we can deduce

33:49.875 --> 33:51.625
these crystalline

33:49.875 --> 33:51.625
tree-shapes

33:51.625 --> 33:53.458
are actually energy

33:51.625 --> 33:53.458
collectors.

33:53.458 --> 33:55.417
Along the same principle

33:55.417 --> 33:58.250
as that which is draining

33:55.417 --> 33:58.250
energy from our ships.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.917
But the Ferengi whips were

33:58.250 --> 34:00.917
working when we first arrived.

34:00.917 --> 34:03.333
Which means something

34:00.917 --> 34:03.333
new has happened.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.542
LA FORGE:

34:03.333 --> 34:05.542
I'm finally beginning

34:03.333 --> 34:05.542
to understand

34:05.542 --> 34:07.041
what my eyes have been

34:05.542 --> 34:07.041
showing me.

34:07.041 --> 34:10.166
It's patterns of force

34:07.041 --> 34:10.166
everywhere.

34:10.166 --> 34:13.959
This entire planet has been

34:10.166 --> 34:13.959
turned into a power accumulator.

34:13.959 --> 34:15.166
And these?

34:15.166 --> 34:16.792
It's the whole point

34:15.166 --> 34:16.792
of this place.

34:16.792 --> 34:19.917
I can see the planet's power

34:16.792 --> 34:19.917
emanating from...

34:19.917 --> 34:21.709
Commander.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.667

35:29.166 --> 35:31.667
Biped, excellent.

35:31.667 --> 35:34.291
Why would we

35:31.667 --> 35:34.291
petition to enter

35:34.291 --> 35:37.417
an empire that

35:34.291 --> 35:37.417
no longer exists?

Why do you attempt

this deception?

35:41.083 --> 35:43.291
The empire is forever.

35:43.291 --> 35:46.625
Your empire fell prey

35:43.291 --> 35:46.625
to a supernova.

We are forever.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.083
Data.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.166
Please repeat

35:52.083 --> 35:54.166
the file.

35:54.166 --> 35:56.500
It is a matter

35:54.166 --> 35:56.500
of record, Portal.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.875
In the age of Makto

35:57.875 --> 36:00.125
the central star

35:57.875 --> 36:00.125
of the Tkon empire

36:00.125 --> 36:01.291
destabilized...

36:01.291 --> 36:04.417
There has never been

36:01.291 --> 36:04.417
an age of Makto.

36:04.417 --> 36:06.500
In fact, there

36:04.417 --> 36:06.500
have been many ages

36:06.500 --> 36:09.500
which have come and

36:06.500 --> 36:09.500
passed since Makto.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.917
This is the age

36:09.500 --> 36:11.917
of Bastu.

36:11.917 --> 36:13.125
I'm afraid not.

36:13.125 --> 36:15.041
According to the Tkon use

36:15.041 --> 36:17.834
of the galactic motionary

36:15.041 --> 36:17.834
startime charts

36:17.834 --> 36:20.041

36:20.041 --> 36:21.750
Xora, Makto...

36:21.750 --> 36:23.166
Enough!

36:23.166 --> 36:24.750
Absurdities.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.000
You must have

36:24.750 --> 36:27.000
been asleep, Portal

36:27.000 --> 36:29.291
for hundreds

36:27.000 --> 36:29.291
of thousands of our years.

36:31.083 --> 36:36.250
Deception is

36:31.083 --> 36:36.250
the way of the human.

36:36.250 --> 36:39.083
We Ferengi will gladly

36:39.083 --> 36:41.250
make a petition.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.625
We invite

36:41.250 --> 36:43.625
your petition.

36:43.625 --> 36:44.834
Speak.

36:44.834 --> 36:50.208
FERENGI:

36:44.834 --> 36:50.208
We wish to offer

36:44.834 --> 36:50.208
our services

36:50.208 --> 36:54.000
to serve the Tkon empire

36:54.000 --> 36:56.083
at no profit.

36:56.083 --> 36:59.625
Return control

36:56.083 --> 36:59.625
of our starship to us

36:59.625 --> 37:03.375
and we will

36:59.625 --> 37:03.375
happily destroy

37:03.375 --> 37:05.959
the human criminals

37:05.959 --> 37:08.750
and their vessel

37:05.959 --> 37:08.750
which attacked us

37:08.750 --> 37:10.875
without provocation.

37:10.875 --> 37:14.000
They came to loot

37:10.875 --> 37:14.000
your empire

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
but...

37:16.000 --> 37:19.208
we intercepted them.

37:19.208 --> 37:22.750
You are accused

37:19.208 --> 37:22.750
of deceit and treachery.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.583
Do you give yourself up

37:24.000 --> 37:27.583
for judgment?

37:27.583 --> 37:29.208
RIKER:

37:27.583 --> 37:29.208
Yes.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.667
If you believe these accusations

37:30.667 --> 37:32.333
then you certainly should act

37:30.667 --> 37:32.333
on them.

37:32.333 --> 37:35.125
And there is even more.

37:35.125 --> 37:37.417
We can prove

37:37.417 --> 37:39.000
that the humans

37:39.000 --> 37:42.291
are destroyers

37:39.000 --> 37:42.291
of legal commerce.

37:42.291 --> 37:45.417
And that they

37:42.291 --> 37:45.417
selfishly withhold

37:45.417 --> 37:49.125
vital technology

37:45.417 --> 37:49.125
from backward worlds.

37:49.125 --> 37:52.875
And necessary defensive

37:49.125 --> 37:52.875
weapons, too.

37:52.875 --> 37:55.709
We Ferengi are

37:52.875 --> 37:55.709
now challenge

37:55.709 --> 37:58.417
this human

37:55.709 --> 37:58.417
madness.

37:58.417 --> 38:01.041
I admit we withheld

37:58.417 --> 38:01.041
modern technologies

38:01.041 --> 38:02.291
from some worlds.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.125
You see,

38:02.291 --> 38:04.125
they are demented.

38:04.125 --> 38:05.750
Their values are insane.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.083
You cannot believe

38:07.083 --> 38:09.375
the business opportunities

38:07.083 --> 38:09.375
they have destroyed.

38:09.375 --> 38:12.041
Proof of their

38:09.375 --> 38:12.041
barbarism--

38:12.041 --> 38:15.166
they adorn

38:12.041 --> 38:15.166
themselves

38:15.166 --> 38:16.500
with gold.

38:16.500 --> 38:20.000
A despicable use of

38:16.500 --> 38:20.000
the valuable metal.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.792
And they

38:20.000 --> 38:23.792
shamelessly

38:23.792 --> 38:26.709
clothe their females.

38:26.709 --> 38:28.792
Inviting others

38:26.709 --> 38:28.792
to unclothe them.

38:28.792 --> 38:31.458
The very depth

38:28.792 --> 38:31.458
of perversion.

38:32.625 --> 38:34.166
Paws off, Ferengi!

38:36.000 --> 38:39.500
No female--

38:36.000 --> 38:39.500
human or Ferengi

38:39.500 --> 38:43.250
can order

38:39.500 --> 38:43.250
Mordoc around.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.458
Submit.

38:45.458 --> 38:47.917
Just try it,

38:45.458 --> 38:47.917
shorty.

38:47.917 --> 38:49.333
At ease, Lieutenant.

38:52.709 --> 38:55.000
And we still have more faults.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.959
They should add

38:55.000 --> 38:56.959
that Starfleet

38:56.959 --> 38:59.083
has permitted several

38:56.959 --> 38:59.083
civilizations to fall.

38:59.083 --> 39:01.709
We have at times

38:59.083 --> 39:01.709
allowed the strong

39:01.709 --> 39:03.458
and violent to

39:01.709 --> 39:03.458
overcome the weak.

39:03.458 --> 39:05.750
They admit their crimes.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.000
Hear them.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.333
They admit the evil

39:07.000 --> 39:10.333
that they do.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.542
Barbarian.

39:13.125 --> 39:16.667
Yes, you show wisdom.

39:16.667 --> 39:19.083
Barbarians, all.

39:19.083 --> 39:21.667
But this one first.

39:23.208 --> 39:24.583
In the fashion

39:24.583 --> 39:27.959
the empire has always

39:24.583 --> 39:27.959
challenged savages.

39:27.959 --> 39:29.542
No!

39:29.542 --> 39:30.667
For battle, come to me!

39:30.667 --> 39:31.834
No!

39:31.834 --> 39:33.250
That's an order.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.583
PORTAL:

39:33.250 --> 39:35.583
You have a single

39:33.250 --> 39:35.583
chance for life.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.208
One only.

39:37.208 --> 39:41.041
What is the answer

39:37.208 --> 39:41.041
to my challenge?

39:41.041 --> 39:43.875
I offer a thought.

39:43.875 --> 39:47.709
"He will triumph

39:43.875 --> 39:47.709
who knows when to fight

39:47.709 --> 39:49.917
and when not to fight."

39:56.250 --> 39:59.083
You are being tested, Riker.

39:59.083 --> 40:01.125
What is the answer?

40:01.125 --> 40:03.250
How do you

40:01.125 --> 40:03.250
know my name?

40:11.875 --> 40:13.041
Ah...

40:13.041 --> 40:17.083
You are facing fate

40:13.041 --> 40:17.083
with composure.

40:17.083 --> 40:20.458
But what is the answer

40:17.083 --> 40:20.458
to my challenge?

40:22.166 --> 40:27.583
Fear is the true enemy,

40:22.166 --> 40:27.583
the only enemy.

40:27.583 --> 40:32.625
Unlike these little ones

40:27.583 --> 40:32.625
who close their minds

40:32.625 --> 40:36.709
your mind holds

40:32.625 --> 40:36.709
interesting thoughts.

40:36.709 --> 40:39.583
"Know your enemy

40:36.709 --> 40:39.583
and know yourself

40:39.583 --> 40:42.417
and you will always

40:39.583 --> 40:42.417
be victorious."

40:42.417 --> 40:44.417
Why that thought?

40:44.417 --> 40:48.125
And who is this Sun Tzu

40:44.417 --> 40:48.125
you revere?

40:49.959 --> 40:52.291
An old Chinese

40:49.959 --> 40:52.291
philosopher

40:52.291 --> 40:55.000
from ancient

40:52.291 --> 40:55.000
Earth history.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.583
You must tell me more

40:55.000 --> 40:56.583
of this wisdom--

40:56.583 --> 40:58.083
so much

40:56.583 --> 40:58.083
like our own.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.583
Gladly, but first,

40:58.083 --> 41:00.583
our starship.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.375
Can you release it?

41:03.375 --> 41:05.458
It is released.

41:05.458 --> 41:08.166
All power

41:05.458 --> 41:08.166
is restored.

41:27.583 --> 41:31.542
Not a moment

41:27.583 --> 41:31.542
too soon, Jean.

41:36.667 --> 41:39.125
I mean, Captain.

41:55.667 --> 41:58.458
I admit, I had

41:55.667 --> 41:58.458
my doubts

41:58.458 --> 42:00.291
as your ships

41:58.458 --> 42:00.291
battled each other

42:00.291 --> 42:02.542
in overt acts

42:00.291 --> 42:02.542
of belligerence.

42:02.542 --> 42:04.041
Normally, I would

42:02.542 --> 42:04.041
have destroyed

42:04.041 --> 42:06.500
all of you

42:04.041 --> 42:06.500
and your ships

42:06.500 --> 42:09.291
but something

42:06.500 --> 42:09.291
confused me.

42:09.291 --> 42:10.875
Which was?

42:10.875 --> 42:13.583
First, you wanted

42:10.875 --> 42:13.583
to destroy each other

42:13.583 --> 42:17.000
then you were willing

42:13.583 --> 42:17.000
to assist each other.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.959
What of our vessel?

42:18.959 --> 42:20.500
We knew

42:18.959 --> 42:20.500
the same answer.

42:20.500 --> 42:23.166
The truth

42:20.500 --> 42:23.166
is I gave

42:23.166 --> 42:25.917
those words

42:23.166 --> 42:25.917
to this human.

42:25.917 --> 42:27.875
What of them?

42:27.875 --> 42:31.083
Shall I

42:27.875 --> 42:31.083
destroy them?

42:31.083 --> 42:33.041
Then they would

42:31.083 --> 42:33.041
learn nothing.

42:33.041 --> 42:36.291
A most interesting

42:33.041 --> 42:36.291
conclusion.

42:36.291 --> 42:40.208
But what if they

42:36.291 --> 42:40.208
never learn, Riker?

42:40.208 --> 42:42.375
Is this a test also?

42:42.375 --> 42:46.041
In life, one is

42:42.375 --> 42:46.041
always tested.

42:46.041 --> 42:49.500
I see them much as we were

42:46.041 --> 42:49.500
several hundred years ago.

42:49.500 --> 42:52.375
But possessing the technology

42:49.500 --> 42:52.375
they now have

42:52.375 --> 42:53.792
they're very dangerous.

42:53.792 --> 42:54.959
Untrue.

42:54.959 --> 42:56.917
We seek friendship

42:54.959 --> 42:56.917
with you.

42:56.917 --> 42:59.250
But we can hardly hate

42:56.917 --> 42:59.250
what we once were.

42:59.250 --> 43:02.458
They may grow and learn.

43:02.458 --> 43:04.458
And learn ways

43:02.458 --> 43:04.458
to destroy you.

43:04.458 --> 43:06.417
Well, our values

43:04.458 --> 43:06.417
require us

43:06.417 --> 43:08.875
to face that

43:06.417 --> 43:08.875
possibility.

43:08.875 --> 43:10.250
What of you?

43:10.250 --> 43:13.250
With your

43:10.250 --> 43:13.250
empire gone?

43:13.250 --> 43:18.417
The universe exists

43:13.250 --> 43:18.417
to me to create life.

43:18.417 --> 43:21.667
I shall sleep...

43:21.667 --> 43:23.125
until needed again.

43:24.875 --> 43:30.000
(<i> explosive thunder</i> )

43:46.375 --> 43:47.583
Compliments,

43:46.375 --> 43:47.583
Lieutenant.

43:47.583 --> 43:48.583
Thank you.

43:48.583 --> 43:49.709
Lieutenant Worf.

43:54.041 --> 43:55.291
You've done well.

43:55.291 --> 43:57.834
Something to write

43:55.291 --> 43:57.834
home about.

43:59.041 --> 44:01.083
"Something to write

43:59.041 --> 44:01.083
home about"?

44:01.083 --> 44:03.083
Data, that's very human.

44:03.083 --> 44:04.417
The T-9 energy converter

44:04.417 --> 44:06.542
has been beamed aboard

44:04.417 --> 44:06.542
and secured, sir.

44:06.542 --> 44:08.792
The Ferengi complained bitterly,

44:06.542 --> 44:08.792
but one final roar

44:08.792 --> 44:10.583
from Portal

44:08.792 --> 44:10.583
convinced them.

44:10.583 --> 44:12.709
I commend your performance,

44:10.583 --> 44:12.709
Number One.

44:12.709 --> 44:14.291
One final request, sir.

44:14.291 --> 44:18.208
Permission to beam a box of

44:14.291 --> 44:18.208
Data's Chinese finger puzzles

44:18.208 --> 44:19.667
over to the Ferengi.

44:19.667 --> 44:22.417
A "thank you" for all

44:19.667 --> 44:22.417
they tried to do.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.542
Make it so.

44:31.917 --> 44:33.542
Set course,

44:31.917 --> 44:33.542
La Forge.
