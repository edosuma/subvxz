00:24.025 --> 00:25.358
Serena?

00:25.426 --> 00:26.926
Hey! Excuse me.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.266
You told me you did your math homework.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.901
You lied to me again. Why?

00:34.969 --> 00:36.335
I can't do it!

00:36.404 --> 00:38.070
And I don't get why I have to.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.072
Jesse didn't finish college,

00:40.141 --> 00:42.808
and he's the greatest singer
who ever lived.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.043
Yeah.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.545
Well, Jesse may not
have finished college,

00:46.614 --> 00:48.948
but he finished the third grade.

00:49.017 --> 00:52.184
Serena, we had an agreement.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.786
Any more unfinished homework...

00:53.855 --> 00:54.787
No!

00:54.856 --> 00:55.922
I'm sorry.

00:55.990 --> 00:58.391
I have to go to that concert!

01:00.528 --> 01:01.694
- Dad.
- Yeah?

01:01.763 --> 01:04.030
Mommy said I can't go
to Jesse's concert.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.331
Tell her...

01:05.400 --> 01:07.333
Tell her to give me a second chance.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.569
Serena, you promised your mother.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.305
Math makes my stomach hurt.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.839
Jesse is life.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.650
What if she does it this morning
before school?

01:19.113 --> 01:23.316
Tom, Serena and I
had an agreement, remember?

01:23.384 --> 01:26.018
Come on, Mom. It's Jesse.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.021
I'll tell you what...

01:29.090 --> 01:30.723
get the homework done right now,

01:30.792 --> 01:33.793
don't lie to your mother again,
ace your next quiz...

01:33.861 --> 01:35.127
which I know you can do...

01:35.196 --> 01:38.764
and we'll all go to Jesse
as a family, frontrow seats.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.933
They're sold out.
There are no frontrow seats.

01:41.002 --> 01:44.570
One of the perks
of being district attorney...

01:44.639 --> 01:46.839
connections.

01:46.908 --> 01:48.140
Come here.

01:50.812 --> 01:52.311
- Go.
- I'm on it!

02:00.455 --> 02:02.054
Carefree days of youth.

02:08.229 --> 02:11.530
Tom. Come on.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.699
She lies, and the consequence
is frontrow seats?

02:13.768 --> 02:16.035
She deserves to have a childhood.

02:16.104 --> 02:18.537
She deserves to be ready for adulthood.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.707
The hours I work,
never getting to see her...

02:21.776 --> 02:23.542
I don't want to be the bad guy.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.278
Which makes it my job?
You get to be Cool Dad?

02:27.949 --> 02:30.282
She has a wild soul, like you,

02:30.351 --> 02:32.351
and I don't ever want her to lose that.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.554
I love her soul.
I'm not trying to crush it.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.991
But there's such a thing as too wild.

02:39.060 --> 02:40.626
I hear you.

02:40.695 --> 02:42.361
And I understand. We'll figure it out.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.230
- Yeah.
- Like we always do.

02:44.298 --> 02:47.233
Just back me up from now on, okay?

02:47.301 --> 02:48.968
Always.

02:49.037 --> 02:50.136
Seriously.

02:50.204 --> 02:53.773
I couldn't... be... more serious.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.940
You're so bad.

03:04.799 --> 03:06.218
<i>We now go to the Capitol,</i>

03:06.287 --> 03:09.655
<i>where, following the killer's
third brutal strike in 10 days,</i>

03:09.724 --> 03:11.390
<i>the governor had this response.</i>

03:11.459 --> 03:12.892
<i>I am confident</i>

03:12.960 --> 03:14.760
<i>that the legislature
will support me, at last,</i>

03:14.829 --> 03:17.029
<i>in taking the necessary steps</i>

03:17.098 --> 03:18.764
<i>to end the moratorium on executions.</i>

03:18.833 --> 03:21.133
Down the rabbit hole I go.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.635
The Heidi case has ripped open?

03:23.871 --> 03:24.970
For starters.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.439
- Morning.
- Morning, Barry.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.706
Morning, Barry.

03:27.775 --> 03:28.707
Good morning, sweetheart.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.776
Serena is in math homework jail,

03:30.845 --> 03:32.545
so don't let her con you
into any detours

03:32.613 --> 03:33.724
on the way home from school.

03:33.748 --> 03:36.615
<i>Criminals live in fear.</i>

03:36.684 --> 03:38.017
<i>It's time to strike back</i>

03:38.086 --> 03:40.252
<i>with the most powerful
deterrent we have.</i>

03:40.321 --> 03:41.754
<i>Should the moratorium be lifted,</i>

03:41.823 --> 03:44.490
<i>the first inmate to be executed
will be Danny Jackson,</i>

03:44.559 --> 03:47.326
<i>convicted of three murders
in Spanish Harbor 10 years ago.</i>

03:47.395 --> 03:49.462
<i>The case made a stir
because Jackson's own brother</i>

03:49.530 --> 03:51.041
<i>was the star witness
for the prosecution...</i>

03:51.065 --> 03:52.231
Grandma?

03:52.300 --> 03:55.101
Why is my dad on TV?

03:55.169 --> 03:56.635
Are they gonna kill my dad?

03:56.704 --> 03:59.538
No. No! No, sweetheart.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.707
YYou promised they were never going to.

04:01.776 --> 04:04.243
I swear to you on my own life...

04:04.312 --> 04:06.178
I'll never let them hurt my baby.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.913
<i>Jackson should be found not guilty</i>

04:07.982 --> 04:10.249
<i>on the grounds that he suffers
from a genetic disorder</i>

04:10.318 --> 04:12.418
<i>linked to intellectual disability.</i>

04:12.487 --> 04:14.019
<i>But the state argued successfully</i>

04:14.088 --> 04:17.223
<i>that his disability was not
a factor in the crimes.</i>

04:17.291 --> 04:19.625
<i>This week on
"Most Wanted: City by the Bay,"</i>

04:19.694 --> 04:21.627
<i>three murders, zero leads.</i>

04:21.696 --> 04:23.629
<i>For the third time in a week and a half,</i>

04:23.698 --> 04:26.298
<i>a young woman stabbed to death.</i>

04:26.367 --> 04:29.168
<i>Once again, the killer
signs his work in blood.</i>

04:29.237 --> 04:30.781
- Go to the other cam.
- <i>Multiple knife wounds,</i>

04:30.805 --> 04:33.272
<i>signs of grisly struggle,
a mangled body abandoned...</i>

04:33.341 --> 04:35.541
Hey, boss? Did we get
the extra five minutes?

04:35.610 --> 04:38.377
Well, it was either
border war in Pakistan,

04:38.446 --> 04:40.112
the funeral of a U.S. senator,

04:40.181 --> 04:42.548
the governor's short list
of candidates to replace him...

04:42.617 --> 04:44.750
Or dead bodies in Dumpsters
all over town.

04:44.819 --> 04:48.821
On our tombstones, Mara...
"We Bled, We Led."

04:48.890 --> 04:51.390
Ready to help the cops bag another one?

04:51.459 --> 04:53.526
Look who's starring on Channel 5.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.994
<i>Stockbroker returning home</i>

04:55.062 --> 04:56.729
<i>to her milliondollar apartment on...</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:58.964
<i>Yes, 10 years ago,
I prosecuted Danny Jackson</i>

04:59.033 --> 05:00.266
<i>for all three murders.</i>

05:00.334 --> 05:02.501
<i>So, no regrets, Mr. Price?</i>

05:02.570 --> 05:04.937
<i>If the moratorium's lifted,
you have total faith</i>

05:05.006 --> 05:08.140
<i>you won't be sending
an innocent man to his death?</i>

05:08.209 --> 05:10.943
<i>Well, I have total faith
in the gifted defense attorneys</i>

05:11.012 --> 05:12.689
<i>who've given everything
they've got to making sure</i>

05:12.713 --> 05:15.748
<i>this man had the full benefit
of due process and the law.</i>

05:15.917 --> 05:17.816
Thank you, Michelle.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.351
Mr. Price!

05:21.789 --> 05:23.189
<i>You will hear the defense make much</i>

05:23.224 --> 05:26.325
<i>of Mr. Jackson's
limited intellectual capacity.</i>

05:26.394 --> 05:29.028
But he had the intelligence

05:29.096 --> 05:31.230
to lie in wait for Carina Markovich,

05:31.299 --> 05:32.831
to put on the gloves

05:32.900 --> 05:35.935
with which he strangled the life
out of Janice Kim,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.704
to stalk Susanna Spencer,
his brother's fiancÃ©e,

05:38.773 --> 05:39.939
the night he slaughtered her.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.508
It's not true! The police lied!

05:42.577 --> 05:44.143
It's not true! They lied!

05:44.212 --> 05:45.652
You shouldn't be here, Mrs. Jackson.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.213
I have files to show you.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.148
In the lineup for the first victim,

05:49.217 --> 05:50.716
Danny was the only Caucasian.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.419
In the second lineup,
he was 3 1/2 inches shorter

05:53.487 --> 05:54.753
than all the other suspects!

05:54.822 --> 05:56.989
Ma'am, would you step back, please?

05:57.058 --> 06:00.071
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Jackson.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.098
I'm running for your mom's dry cleaning,

06:06.167 --> 06:07.766
and you know the cleaningday rules,

06:07.835 --> 06:10.369
so don't party too hard, okay?

06:10.438 --> 06:11.904
Don't worry.

06:11.973 --> 06:14.273
I'll only have a hundred friends over.

06:14.342 --> 06:15.908
I'll be right back.

06:36.931 --> 06:38.130
What's up, Tiger Lily?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.372
Hi, angel.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.241
<i>Does your husband think
he can just not pay?</i>

06:49.310 --> 06:50.576
Who is this?

06:50.645 --> 06:52.256
<i>You better get home quick
with the whole $60k.</i>

06:52.280 --> 06:53.612
<i>Serena's waiting for her mother.</i>

06:53.681 --> 06:55.447
<i>And cops... not such a good idea.</i>

06:55.516 --> 06:57.783
<i>You have 10 minutes.</i>

07:22.877 --> 07:23.877
Dance break!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.878
Ayeaye, Captain Nico!

07:27.848 --> 07:29.181
Hey!

07:30.618 --> 07:32.017
Get away from my daughter!

07:34.121 --> 07:37.623
Captain Nico says if you borrow money,

07:37.692 --> 07:39.391
it's bad not to pay it back.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.799
Truly, it was...
it was just an honest mistake.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.100
I apologize.

07:48.169 --> 07:50.202
Inspector Kupner, will you
please acquaint this man

07:50.271 --> 07:51.804
with the concept of wasted breath?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.339
We are licensed investigators

07:53.407 --> 07:55.774
legally collecting a debt
from a Mr. Davidson Norris.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.177
It's not our fault nobody
told our client the guy moved.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.545
The only relevant fact here

07:59.613 --> 08:01.947
is that this man broke into my home

08:02.016 --> 08:03.782
and terrified my 8yearold daughter.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.517
I wasn't scared for one second.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.820
We were having the best time ever.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.155
We'll take care of it
from here, Mrs. Price.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.737
Let's not tell Daddy about this, okay?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.394
It will only upset him.

08:15.463 --> 08:19.031
Don't worry, Captain Nico.
I will save you!

08:19.100 --> 08:20.733
Okay, come on. Let's go, sweetheart.

08:22.737 --> 08:25.137
Stop thinking with your head, Cupcake.

08:25.206 --> 08:27.206
Think with that
big bleeding heart of yours.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.019
Think about what this would do
to Jenny's parole.

08:29.043 --> 08:30.576
Don't do this, Nico.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.010
One teeny, tiny tap on "delete,"

08:33.080 --> 08:35.179
and just like you getting to second base

08:35.249 --> 08:37.750
with Heidi Wilson in 8th grade,

08:37.818 --> 08:38.884
this never happened.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.018
That totally happened.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.721
Not according to Heidi it didn't.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.657
Muscling deadbeats for cash? You?

08:45.726 --> 08:46.726
Hello, Nico.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.830
<i>Hola,</i> Captain Sarneau.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.566
What's the illustrious former
detective being charged with?

08:54.635 --> 08:56.301
Unlawful entry.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.103
Enjoy your stay, Nico.

09:07.081 --> 09:09.681
What are you inhaling?

09:09.750 --> 09:13.819
Cold sweat dripping from a perp
right before he caves,

09:13.888 --> 09:17.122
rust on a badge after a rainy stakeout,

09:17.191 --> 09:19.057
dust gathering on overtime requests.

09:21.529 --> 09:24.997
The sweet, musty aromas of my old life.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.665
You wishing you had it back?

09:26.734 --> 09:29.635
That would be
a prizewinning waste of time.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.670
Right at that desk, Nico.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.506
Me looking at five years
for soliciting and possession,

09:34.575 --> 09:37.075
you cutting me loose for reasons
I have yet to fathom.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.011
So...

09:39.079 --> 09:41.447
I am expected to believe

09:41.515 --> 09:43.749
that totally by some random coincidence,

09:43.818 --> 09:47.386
you just happened to break into
the loft of the prosecutor

09:47.455 --> 09:49.054
who put your brother on death row.

09:51.492 --> 09:52.524
What?

09:53.861 --> 09:54.893
That woman was...

09:54.962 --> 09:56.862
Mrs. Thomas Price. You know what?

09:56.931 --> 09:59.364
Don't insult the distant memory
of our friendship

09:59.433 --> 10:02.568
by pretending
that you didn't know, okay?

10:02.636 --> 10:06.071
Look, whatever hellish game
you were up to here,

10:06.140 --> 10:07.506
you take it to another precinct.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.881
A million people in this city...
what are the chances?

10:15.950 --> 10:19.151
Apparently, 100%,
because that's what happened.

10:19.220 --> 10:22.621
How long do we have to keep waiting for?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.690
Till the person
I need to see comes home.

10:26.694 --> 10:27.926
Jesse!

10:29.396 --> 10:30.762
Ruby, no!

10:30.831 --> 10:32.831
That's my favorite song!

10:32.900 --> 10:33.966
Mine too!

10:34.034 --> 10:35.501
I bet it's gonna go triple platinum.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.703
My God. Where'd you get
that backpack from?

10:37.771 --> 10:39.271
It's so beautiful!

10:42.109 --> 10:44.176
Take it. I have, like, 50 backpacks.

10:44.245 --> 10:45.310
Thank you!

10:45.379 --> 10:46.678
My name's Ruby.

10:46.747 --> 10:50.282
I have 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.

10:50.351 --> 10:52.117
But we all have something, right?

10:52.186 --> 10:53.719
What's your name and what do you have?

10:53.787 --> 10:56.989
Serena Price, and... I have an allergy.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.157
No. What are you allergic to?

10:59.226 --> 11:02.561
Mrs. Price, could you give this
to your husband, please?

11:02.630 --> 11:05.364
These are files regarding the
case of my son, Danny Jackson.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.033
I'm sorry. You'll have to
contact his office.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.102
Message me @JesselsGod!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.870
Sweetie, we have to go.

11:17.278 --> 11:20.479
Ruby's funny, she's nice,

11:20.548 --> 11:22.381
and she loves Jesse way more than I do,

11:22.449 --> 11:25.150
which I didn't think was possible.

11:25.219 --> 11:26.652
Why can't I call her?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.388
Because her grandmother...

11:29.456 --> 11:31.089
Her grandmother what?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.291
Sweetie.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.726
You have 10 math problems
due by tomorrow...

11:34.795 --> 11:36.895
and spelling,
and you haven't even started.

11:36.964 --> 11:40.265
So... let's get focused.

11:40.334 --> 11:42.067
Can I call her after I'm done?

11:42.136 --> 11:43.168
Focus.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.168
Serena?

12:20.207 --> 12:23.108
Snack time, angel. Hardworking...

12:43.130 --> 12:45.564
Mr. Debray! Mr. Debray! Mr. Debray!

12:45.633 --> 12:46.832
This is Serena.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.501
Serena, this is
my favorite teacher, Mr. Debray.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.370
Well, we're glad you're here, Serena.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.105
Okay.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.074
Hey. Thank you for being Ruby's friend.

12:57.378 --> 12:58.510
Dance time!

13:10.924 --> 13:11.990
Serena!

13:15.729 --> 13:17.796
Do you have any idea
how frightened I was?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.078
I think it would be better if
you didn't see Serena anymore.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.102
Please don't go!

13:23.137 --> 13:25.370
Do not grab my daughter.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.106
Are you okay?

13:28.175 --> 13:30.475
Look what you did! It was her father's!

13:30.544 --> 13:33.011
It was the most important thing
in the world to her!

13:33.080 --> 13:35.180
Is everything okay here?

13:35.249 --> 13:36.515
I'm sorry.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.884
I'm sorry the camera's broken.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.287
I'll fix it and I'll bring it
back to the school, okay?

13:42.356 --> 13:44.356
You did notice she wasn't
a student here, right?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.059
All right.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.062
- I'm right here, Ruby. I'm right here.
- I'm not going with you!

13:50.130 --> 13:51.930
Come here.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.732
Don't ever, ever, do this again!

13:53.801 --> 13:55.067
How did you get there?

13:55.135 --> 13:58.403
We took the bus, just like
a billion people do every day.

13:58.472 --> 14:00.706
Serena, the city is very dangerous.

14:03.644 --> 14:05.110
A tire blew.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.913
That was cool!

14:07.981 --> 14:10.982
But don't ever try that again, okay?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.908
They'll have the tire changed
in two minutes.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.176
You okay?

14:38.245 --> 14:39.845
All right.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.680
Thanks for letting me use your phone.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.717
Is she your daughter?

14:45.786 --> 14:47.419
Yes. She is.

14:47.488 --> 14:49.020
She's beautiful.

14:50.591 --> 14:52.057
Where is she?

14:56.497 --> 14:58.497
It's such a lovely store.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.800
I don't know why
I never noticed it before.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.871
There's something
I'd like to give you...

15:05.939 --> 15:08.006
an oldfashioned photograph.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.541
Would you like one?

15:09.610 --> 15:11.543
Yes, please!

15:19.486 --> 15:21.753
It's lovely. Thank you so much.

15:22.823 --> 15:24.923
You will soon lose something
more precious to you

15:24.992 --> 15:27.125
than anything in the whole world.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.426
Water will take it away.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.262
That is your fate... written in stone

15:30.330 --> 15:32.397
a million years before you were born.

15:32.466 --> 15:33.732
It's late. We better get going.

15:33.801 --> 15:36.701
Fate is your enemy.
You can't flee from her.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.738
The only way is to fight her headon.

15:39.807 --> 15:43.475
But you cannot win
until the price is paid.

15:43.544 --> 15:46.111
For one to live, one must die.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.646
Who has to die?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.214
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.018
Serena, get in the car. Come on.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.888
Nothing is a coincidence!

15:56.957 --> 15:58.990
Everything is connected!

16:11.150 --> 16:13.837
Don't sleep too long.
You got pictures to take.

16:13.892 --> 16:15.959
Rich wife plus lyin', cheatin' husband

16:16.027 --> 16:18.261
equals this month's rent.

16:18.330 --> 16:19.829
Siesta first.

16:23.158 --> 16:24.290
Why did you put that up?

16:24.359 --> 16:26.159
A reminder that even the icy heart

16:26.227 --> 16:27.994
of a police captain can be melted

16:28.063 --> 16:30.797
and that even the pure heart
of a little girl can be conned

16:30.865 --> 16:33.399
into thinking that Nico
Jackson's ass is worth saving.

16:33.468 --> 16:35.234
She does have a way with glitter.

16:35.303 --> 16:36.936
I'm waking you up in half an hour.

16:37.005 --> 16:38.237
- Yeah.
- Keep your phone on.

16:44.712 --> 16:45.745
Don't judge me.

16:50.452 --> 16:51.918
Nico, are you in there?!

16:54.656 --> 16:55.755
Hey, Mom.

16:57.358 --> 16:59.158
Uncle Nico, Uncle Nico, Uncle Nico!

16:59.227 --> 17:01.060
You're getting heavy!

17:04.132 --> 17:05.330
Mom?

17:05.400 --> 17:06.911
Nico, did you hear
what the governor said?

17:06.935 --> 17:09.246
Hey, Ruby, you want to run grab
yourself a soda from the fridge?

17:09.270 --> 17:11.270
Man, you bet!

17:11.339 --> 17:12.605
Go ahead.

17:15.510 --> 17:16.709
Yes.

17:16.778 --> 17:18.344
I heard what the governor said.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.246
- You know Danny.
- Mom.

17:20.315 --> 17:21.791
- He loved Susanna like you did.
- Mom. Mom.

17:21.816 --> 17:24.295
- And the others... he could never have...
- The blood on the clothes under the bed.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.417
- Please, Nico.
- The knife.

17:25.487 --> 17:26.551
The confession, Mom.

17:26.621 --> 17:27.932
- You've got to stop, Mom.
- Call the judge!

17:27.955 --> 17:30.534
Tell him it was dark that night,
that you're not sure what you saw.

17:30.558 --> 17:31.591
Mom!

17:31.659 --> 17:33.893
Could you just... visit him?

17:37.098 --> 17:38.664
Before...

17:38.733 --> 17:40.666
Hey.

17:40.735 --> 17:42.835
I have some work
I have to get back to, okay?

17:42.904 --> 17:45.872
But I want you to visit me
again, all right, Ruby Tuesday?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.473
Goodbye, Uncle Nico.

17:47.542 --> 17:48.542
Potatoes...

17:48.610 --> 17:50.476
Fried!

18:08.963 --> 18:10.696
I killed her!

18:15.637 --> 18:19.839
Who did he say was responsible
for Susanna's death?

18:19.908 --> 18:23.309
What did your brother say
when you saw him with the body?

18:26.948 --> 18:29.148
Mr. Jackson?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.197
Whoo!

18:44.265 --> 18:45.765
Aww!

18:46.968 --> 18:48.301
Yay!

18:48.369 --> 18:51.070
Make a wish before you say
anything, or it won't come true.

18:51.139 --> 18:52.038
It already has.

18:52.106 --> 18:54.640
You say that every year.

18:55.743 --> 18:56.676
Present!

18:56.744 --> 18:59.312
Ooooh!

18:59.380 --> 19:02.248
Looks like a regular, normal pen, right?

19:02.317 --> 19:03.749
Wrong!

19:03.818 --> 19:06.986
Press this button,
and it's a laser death ray.

19:07.055 --> 19:08.854
- Pew, pew, pew!
- Aah!

19:08.923 --> 19:11.023
I love it, sweetie!

19:12.260 --> 19:14.227
Dad, have you seen my journal?

19:14.295 --> 19:15.561
On the windowsill.

19:15.630 --> 19:16.963
Did you peek?

19:17.031 --> 19:18.991
I swear on all the hobbits
in The Shire, I didn't.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.269
Mnh!

19:23.338 --> 19:24.704
Are you okay?

19:24.772 --> 19:26.706
- Sweetie!
- Sweetie, come here.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.374
Look. No glass.

19:28.443 --> 19:30.243
You're good. I'll fix it up, okay?

19:47.829 --> 19:50.696
I love Jesse, but can we have
something quieter?

19:52.934 --> 19:54.333
<i>City in terror</i>

19:54.402 --> 19:56.202
<i>as the killer claims a fourth victim</i>

19:56.271 --> 19:57.970
<i>in a grim replay of an all...</i>

19:58.039 --> 19:59.272
Okay.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.641
Who wants cake for breakfast?

20:04.946 --> 20:08.414
My husband always was a passionate man.

20:08.483 --> 20:11.617
A bastard and a criminal...

20:11.686 --> 20:13.252
but passionate.

20:13.321 --> 20:15.021
$5,000.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.556
Dangerous man like your husband,
that's the rate.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.792
- Two double cosmos.
- You got it.

20:19.861 --> 20:21.060
Make that one.

20:23.164 --> 20:27.133
When I indulge, things tend
to get a little...

20:27.201 --> 20:29.001
unpredictable.

20:29.070 --> 20:32.872
Maybe I'm in the mood for unpredictable.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.640
That's revenge talking.

20:35.677 --> 20:37.576
You underestimate yourself.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.115
That's a sin I've never been accused of.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.462
God.

20:59.901 --> 21:03.636
Sing me the song again...
about the umbrellas.

21:03.705 --> 21:05.104
Yeah.

21:05.173 --> 21:07.506
Let's skip coffee
and get right to the show tunes.

21:07.575 --> 21:09.375
Aw, please?

21:11.446 --> 21:13.245
Can you hum me a few bars?

21:15.183 --> 21:17.216
You don't remember?

21:19.454 --> 21:22.054
That's the upside
of being a blackout drunk...

21:22.123 --> 21:24.490
less to regret.

21:24.559 --> 21:28.761
Well, we'll make new memories, then.

21:28.830 --> 21:29.962
Sounds good.

21:37.372 --> 21:39.372
You're a talented man.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.440
Anya?

21:40.475 --> 21:42.375
Don't worry.

21:42.443 --> 21:44.910
It's just my soontobeexhusband.

21:44.979 --> 21:45.911
Yeah. I'm worried.

21:45.980 --> 21:46.980
Who's there?

21:51.319 --> 21:52.319
Anya?

21:55.089 --> 21:56.288
Hey!

22:03.164 --> 22:05.064
<i>Tonight, the city is bracing itself</i>

22:05.133 --> 22:07.800
<i>after the body of another woman
was found in a Dumpster</i>

22:07.869 --> 22:10.536
<i>behind a popular nightclub
in the Richmond District.</i>

22:10.605 --> 22:12.538
<i>Authorities believe her
to be the fifth victim</i>

22:12.607 --> 22:14.340
<i>of a killer stalking city streets.</i>

22:15.943 --> 22:17.376
<i>I saw her.</i>

22:17.445 --> 22:19.285
<i>I remember the skull

22:19.313 --> 22:21.547
<i>in the Richmond, Park something...</i>

22:21.616 --> 22:23.582
<i>No, Parade.</i>

22:23.651 --> 22:26.719
<i>Something that begins with a "P."</i>

22:26.788 --> 22:29.455
<i>I was there from, like,
11:00 to midnight.</i>

22:33.895 --> 22:36.562
Is it the place?

22:36.631 --> 22:39.265
How do you pick them?

22:39.333 --> 22:40.599
What's your pattern?

23:02.323 --> 23:04.023
Sweetheart.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.591
I'm so sorry.

23:09.030 --> 23:12.031
I know how much he meant to you.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.868
WWhy do people have to die?

23:15.937 --> 23:18.637
Sometimes...

23:18.706 --> 23:21.006
things just are.

23:21.075 --> 23:22.075
And they hurt.

23:23.277 --> 23:27.012
There's a midnight vigil at his house.

23:27.081 --> 23:29.682
I want to ggo with Ruby.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.883
Let me talk to Dad, okay?

23:30.952 --> 23:33.619
That's what you always say when it's no.

23:33.688 --> 23:35.688
Why can't I go?!

23:35.756 --> 23:38.491
Because midnight is too late.

23:38.559 --> 23:40.926
And Ruby...

23:40.995 --> 23:42.461
she's much older than you.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.898
I understand this is hard.

23:45.967 --> 23:47.233
You don't understand anything!

23:47.301 --> 23:49.168
You're the worst mom in the world!

23:49.237 --> 23:50.803
You didn't even fix the camera yet,

23:50.872 --> 23:53.939
and if you hate Ruby, I hate you!

24:00.748 --> 24:02.848
You can fix it? I know it's superold.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.151
And then there were six.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.420
Do the cops have anything?

24:08.489 --> 24:11.957
Just this... in her pocket.

24:14.095 --> 24:16.362
Mara, we're nailing this guy.

24:16.430 --> 24:18.998
Get me every witness,
every police report,

24:19.066 --> 24:21.333
every scrap of CCTV.

24:21.402 --> 24:23.536
I'll get us an hour
on prime time on Tuesday,

24:23.604 --> 24:26.272
with a callin.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.407
You think we can
pull it together by then?

24:28.476 --> 24:31.844
Do not let the witnesses talk
to each other in the greenroom.

24:31.913 --> 24:33.012
How you doing, sweetie?

24:33.080 --> 24:35.147
Aaron! Someone put a black tie on Ted.

24:35.216 --> 24:36.615
He looks like a Christmas tree.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.883
- Mom?
- Yes, angel?

24:37.952 --> 24:39.151
I miss Ruby.

24:39.220 --> 24:41.487
I've been really good,
and I've done all my homework.

24:41.556 --> 24:42.755
Can I please go see her?

24:42.823 --> 24:44.957
Let me talk to Dad about it.

24:46.260 --> 24:48.394
Laura. We're on in 60 seconds.

24:48.462 --> 24:49.495
Yes, we are.

24:49.564 --> 24:50.496
Okay.

24:50.565 --> 24:51.697
Yes? Hello?

24:51.766 --> 24:52.665
Hi, Barry.

24:52.733 --> 24:53.966
Well, I promised Serena

24:54.035 --> 24:55.968
that Auntie Mara
would walk her down, okay?

24:56.037 --> 24:57.169
And here she is.

24:57.238 --> 24:58.282
All right, beautiful. Ready to go?

24:58.306 --> 24:59.538
Hi, Auntie Mara.

24:59.607 --> 25:02.308
I've got to work late,
but I will come in and kiss you.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.144
I never want you to kiss me again.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.712
Well, I love you, no matter what.

25:06.781 --> 25:09.081
In five, four, three...

25:12.353 --> 25:14.231
It's just over there. Are you
guys gonna have fun tonight?

25:14.255 --> 25:15.955
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:16.023 --> 25:17.023
All right.

25:17.058 --> 25:19.224
Hey.

25:19.293 --> 25:21.026
See you.

25:21.095 --> 25:24.263
What do you want from me?
There is nothing left!

25:25.499 --> 25:27.433
We have operators to take your calls

25:27.501 --> 25:29.168
and Captain Sarneau and her team here

25:29.236 --> 25:31.670
to follow up on every lead you give us.

25:31.839 --> 25:33.272
Captain Sarneau?

25:33.341 --> 25:35.040
<i>Take a look at this sketch.</i>

25:35.109 --> 25:37.776
<i>Caucasian male, brown hair, long face.</i>

25:37.845 --> 25:39.244
Tighter on the sketch.

25:39.313 --> 25:40.757
<i>Now, our profilers
are telling us that...</i>

25:40.781 --> 25:42.648
- Yes?
- <i>Hi, it's Barry.</i>

25:42.717 --> 25:44.695
- <i>I thought you were sending her out.</i>
- I did, with Mara.

25:44.719 --> 25:46.685
<i>- Not here yet.
- What?</i>

25:46.754 --> 25:48.854
Laura, I'm telling you...
I don't see her.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.992
Somebody claiming
to be the killer... line 2.

25:54.228 --> 25:55.327
<i>Laura, are you there?</i>

25:55.396 --> 25:57.663
<i>Some crime stoppers you are.</i>

25:57.732 --> 25:59.743
<i>You think you can catch me
with that pathetic sketch?</i>

25:59.767 --> 26:01.266
<i>I wish I was that goodlooking.</i>

26:01.335 --> 26:03.335
How do we know
you're who you say you are?

26:03.404 --> 26:05.004
<i>The news didn't mention
the sapphire ring</i>

26:05.072 --> 26:07.072
<i>that I took from the second girl.</i>

26:08.109 --> 26:10.442
<i>I hope you're watching,
District Attorney Price.</i>

26:10.503 --> 26:11.891
<i>Because I'm one criminal</i>

26:11.915 --> 26:13.813
<i>you'll never put on death row.</i>

26:13.814 --> 26:15.147
<i>Recognize this voice?</i>

26:15.216 --> 26:17.549
<i>Talk. Go on... talk!</i>

26:17.618 --> 26:20.552
<i>Mom! Mom, I'm scared!</i>

26:20.621 --> 26:22.287
<i>Are you listening now?</i>

26:24.492 --> 26:26.191
<i>I have your daughter.</i>

26:26.260 --> 26:27.571
<i>I better have your attention, too...</i>

26:27.595 --> 26:29.728
<i>everybody's attention.</i>

26:29.797 --> 26:33.232
<i>So much for the death penalty
as a deterrent, Mr. Governor.</i>

26:33.300 --> 26:35.634
<i>Ready to have a child's blood
on your hands?</i>

26:35.703 --> 26:36.735
- Serena!
<i>- Mommy!</i>

26:36.804 --> 26:37.804
- Serena?
- <i>Mo...</i>

26:46.514 --> 26:49.394
She was running to Barry... in his car.

26:49.457 --> 26:51.938
I'm so sorry, Laura.
I didn't know she was there.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.518
Okay.

26:53.587 --> 26:54.587
There she is.

26:57.358 --> 26:59.397
Where did she go?

26:59.927 --> 27:01.426
Wait! Stop!

27:01.495 --> 27:02.628
Go back!

27:04.365 --> 27:05.397
HHold it. Hold it.

27:07.701 --> 27:08.867
Zoom in.

27:14.608 --> 27:15.941
I need to talk to him.

27:19.513 --> 27:23.882
Clear to air
in five, four, three, two...

27:29.156 --> 27:33.091
I don't know why you took my Serena.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.694
Maybe it's because you wanted to prove

27:35.763 --> 27:41.099
how foolish and arrogant I was
for thinking I could catch you.

27:41.168 --> 27:44.536
<i>I was. II know that now.</i>

27:44.605 --> 27:47.139
I'm talking to you...

27:48.609 --> 27:50.542
because you're somebody's son,

27:50.611 --> 27:53.311
maybe somebody's father.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.982
And I'm begging you not to hurt her.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.451
Have mercy on her.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.020
Send her home safe and alive.

28:02.089 --> 28:03.689
<i>And if you can't...</i>

28:03.757 --> 28:06.324
<i>if you can't let go of your anger...</i>

28:06.393 --> 28:07.414
<i>take me.</i>

28:08.796 --> 28:10.829
<i>Do whatever you want with me.</i>

28:10.898 --> 28:12.764
Take me instead

28:12.833 --> 28:17.002
aand just send Serena back
to her father, who loves her.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.971
I don't care about the governor
or the death penalty.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.474
I just want my baby back.

28:22.543 --> 28:25.310
Please.

28:25.379 --> 28:27.045
Please.

28:33.187 --> 28:35.287
<i>This criminal announced his crime</i>

28:35.355 --> 28:37.589
<i>as a personal challenge to me.</i>

28:37.658 --> 28:39.691
<i>And I vow, as a father,</i>

28:39.760 --> 28:41.999
<i>that I will rise to that challenge.</i>

28:42.663 --> 28:44.763
<i>I will see that this monster</i>

28:44.832 --> 28:46.965
<i>and all who take the lives of innocents</i>

28:47.034 --> 28:48.900
<i>pay the highest price.</i>

29:15.562 --> 29:17.462
These were found in her pockets.

29:17.531 --> 29:19.064
Do you recognize them?

29:20.167 --> 29:22.067
Serena... she didn't draw that.

29:22.136 --> 29:24.569
That... that... the ssnakes and thorns,

29:24.638 --> 29:27.606
she's never drawn anything like that.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.842
What about the safety pin?

29:30.911 --> 29:32.077
It was caught in her sweater.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.913
SShe wasn't wearing
a safety pin last night.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.416
What about this?

29:38.485 --> 29:40.619
What is that? Are th... flowers? W...

29:40.687 --> 29:41.887
They're marsh harebell.

29:41.955 --> 29:44.456
They're found in swamps...
not around here.

29:44.525 --> 29:45.568
They might help tell us where...

29:45.592 --> 29:47.125
Wait. Wait. Toy car?

29:47.194 --> 29:48.593
She never plays with cars.

29:48.662 --> 29:49.828
She hates all that.

30:22.262 --> 30:26.097
It is tragic that it took
the death of Serena Price,

30:26.166 --> 30:29.568
a child who could have been
our own granddaughter,

30:29.636 --> 30:31.670
to end the footdragging.

30:31.738 --> 30:34.039
<i>I am instructing
the Department of Corrections</i>

30:34.107 --> 30:37.409
<i>to recommence executions
effective immediately.</i>

30:37.477 --> 30:39.211
<i>Through a careful process of discussion,</i>

30:39.279 --> 30:41.880
<i>the first to be executed
will be Daniel Jackson,</i>

30:41.949 --> 30:44.549
<i>a man guilty of murdering
two young women...</i>

30:44.618 --> 30:47.552
<i>A heartbreaking scene today
at Black Pine Cove,</i>

30:47.621 --> 30:49.688
<i>where a local fisherman
discovered the body</i>

30:49.756 --> 30:51.489
<i>of missing Serena Price,</i>

30:51.558 --> 30:54.426
<i>the daughter
of District Attorney Tom Price.</i>

30:59.766 --> 31:02.167
Your daddy's
going to Heaven, sweetheart.

31:04.104 --> 31:07.072
And when he gets there...

31:07.140 --> 31:09.507
he'll have Serena to keep him company.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.013
There's no such place as Heaven.

31:15.082 --> 31:19.150
So Serena ccan't be there,
wwhich means she's here.

31:19.219 --> 31:21.253
She's right here. She's...

31:21.321 --> 31:23.922
She's... She's right...
She's right here.

31:40.832 --> 31:41.898
What you are doing?

31:41.966 --> 31:43.799
I can't see them every day.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.868
Then don't come in here.

31:45.936 --> 31:47.896
They should go to children
who are gonna use them.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.673
You don't have the right to
make that decision on your own.

31:51.742 --> 31:53.342
I can't do this the way you're doing it.

31:53.410 --> 31:54.576
Your way is better?

31:54.645 --> 31:58.380
Three months... grieving time's up?

31:58.449 --> 31:59.849
Time to act like she never existed?

31:59.884 --> 32:01.583
Is that what you think I'm doing?

32:01.652 --> 32:03.886
How dare you!

32:08.425 --> 32:09.958
Um...

32:10.027 --> 32:11.467
every time I look at you, I think...

32:11.495 --> 32:14.296
That I sent Serena downstairs
with my assistant

32:14.365 --> 32:16.198
when I knew there was
a killer in the city...

32:16.267 --> 32:18.100
a killer my show was going after.

32:19.870 --> 32:22.371
That's not what I was going to say.

32:24.742 --> 32:26.642
I thought I could
carry you through this.

32:29.613 --> 32:32.381
I hoped we could
carry each other, but...

32:32.449 --> 32:34.249
we can't.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.401
Mom.

32:52.469 --> 32:54.236
<i>They're killing him...</i>

32:54.305 --> 32:57.005
<i>at 7:00... in one hour.</i>

32:57.074 --> 32:59.308
Please come... ffor Ruby. I...

32:59.376 --> 33:01.388
There's no time to pick you up.
I'll meet you there, okay?

33:01.412 --> 33:02.412
<i>Bless you.</i>

33:11.422 --> 33:12.955
Whoa, whoa. Okay.

33:13.023 --> 33:16.158
My wife finally coughed up
your name, Mr. Jackson.

33:16.226 --> 33:17.826
I envy you, my friend.

33:17.895 --> 33:19.127
Today, you will cross the veil

33:19.196 --> 33:20.840
and discover the answer
to the great mystery.

33:20.864 --> 33:22.364
Listen for one second.

34:46.382 --> 34:49.150
If you kill me,
my mother loses two sons today.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.385
It'll do her in.

34:50.454 --> 34:52.065
You really want to kill
somebody's mother?

34:52.089 --> 34:53.655
Everybody has a mother.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.456
And everybody dies.

35:02.066 --> 35:04.566
Mommy's coming, angel.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.669
You won't be alone anymore.
You won't be cold.

37:42.025 --> 37:44.559
Looks like we really surprised her?

37:46.029 --> 37:47.974
Don't say anything
until you blow the candles out,

37:47.998 --> 37:49.464
or the wish won't come true.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.734
Is it...

37:54.104 --> 37:55.837
Is it really you?

37:55.906 --> 37:57.339
Who else would it be?

38:06.065 --> 38:08.322
Mommy, let go! You're hurting me!

38:08.369 --> 38:10.268
OOOkay.
Go get ready for school, honey.

38:10.337 --> 38:11.848
Isn't Mommy gonna blow out the candles?

38:11.872 --> 38:13.838
She'll blow them out later. Off you go.

38:15.242 --> 38:18.243
Hey. Are... Are you okay?

38:18.312 --> 38:19.911
What happened to you?

38:19.980 --> 38:21.579
Did you walk through a sprinkler?

38:21.648 --> 38:23.148
It's impossible.

38:23.216 --> 38:24.416
She died.

38:24.484 --> 38:26.117
- Who died?
- Serena.

38:26.186 --> 38:30.055
We... She drowned on the 12th,
a week after my birthday.

39:24.277 --> 39:28.012
Whoever you are, whatever you are...

39:33.420 --> 39:35.687
thank you for giving me back
my Serena.

39:40.994 --> 39:42.527
Hey.

39:42.596 --> 39:43.596
Hey.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.901
You want to tell me about your swim?

39:49.970 --> 39:52.470
Mom, Mom!
Mommy, I got a present for you!

39:52.539 --> 39:53.539
Yeah?

39:54.841 --> 39:57.442
Looks like a regular, normal pen, right?

39:59.346 --> 40:02.580
Looks like a regular, normal pen, right?

40:02.649 --> 40:03.649
Wrong!

40:03.717 --> 40:05.183
Press this button, and it's...

40:05.252 --> 40:06.985
a laser death ray.

40:07.053 --> 40:08.253
Pew, pew!

40:09.790 --> 40:11.089
It's...

40:11.158 --> 40:12.924
I love it.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.793
Dad, have you seen my journal?

40:14.861 --> 40:16.694
It's over on the windowsill.

40:16.763 --> 40:18.096
Did you peek?

40:18.165 --> 40:20.265
I swear on all the hobbits
in The Shire, I didn't.

40:25.505 --> 40:27.172
Stop! I'll get your journal.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.706
No, you'll read it!

40:28.775 --> 40:29.775
Go around the rug!

40:38.318 --> 40:40.218
- Sweetie!
- Sweetie, come here.

40:40.287 --> 40:41.719
Okay, no glass.

40:41.788 --> 40:44.456
I'll fix you up. Be right back.

40:44.524 --> 40:45.824
Everything's the same.

40:45.892 --> 40:47.258
What are you talking about?

40:51.998 --> 40:53.198
<i>City in terror</i>

40:53.266 --> 40:55.233
<i>as the killer claims a fourth victim</i>

40:55.302 --> 40:56.901
<i>in a grim replay of...</i>

40:57.070 --> 40:59.204
<i>city in terror
and the killer claims...</i>

40:59.272 --> 41:00.512
<i>an alltoo familiar scenario.</i>

41:00.540 --> 41:02.407
He's killing them.

41:02.476 --> 41:04.042
Ilt's all happening the same.

41:15.121 --> 41:17.555
You will soon lose
something more precious to you

41:17.624 --> 41:19.123
than anything in the world.

41:19.192 --> 41:20.992
That is your fate... written in stone

41:21.061 --> 41:23.862
a million years before you were born.

41:23.930 --> 41:25.163
Mom.

41:25.232 --> 41:28.433
Why are you acting so weird today?

41:31.171 --> 41:35.006
I am not gonna let anybody
hurt you this time.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.442
I swear to you on my life.

41:37.511 --> 41:39.310
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

41:39.379 --> 41:40.545
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

41:40.614 --> 41:41.746
No!

41:41.815 --> 41:43.648
Fate is your enemy.
You can't flee from her.

41:43.717 --> 41:45.984
The only way is to fight her headon.

41:48.421 --> 41:50.488
Baby, this time I'll save you.
