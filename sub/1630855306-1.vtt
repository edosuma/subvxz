00:42.791 --> 00:44.000
<i>But spicy?</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
<i>Yeah. See, that's how I got here.</i>

00:46.708 --> 00:48.333
<i>To this moment.</i>

00:48.333 --> 00:52.375
<i>Me, the most uneducated,
successful</i> vato <i>you'll ever meet.</i>

00:53.166 --> 00:56.708
<i>I served up my pride on a silver platter
more than once along the way.</i>

00:57.250 --> 00:59.833
<i>With my head held high,
I worked my way through kitchens,</i>

00:59.833 --> 01:03.708
<i>chicken coops, mechanic shops,
breaking a sweat to make a dollar stretch.</i>

01:05.125 --> 01:06.625
<i>Until I got here.</i>

01:07.208 --> 01:09.333
<i>See, I'm the guy
who helped bring the world</i>

01:09.333 --> 01:11.375

01:11.375 --> 01:12.541
Here you go, ma'am.

01:12.541 --> 01:14.041
<i>Nah, not that fool.</i>

01:14.750 --> 01:16.750
<i>Yeah, that fine-looking</i> guapo <i>right there,</i>

01:16.750 --> 01:19.375

<i>See, but I didn't always schmooze
with the big dogs. Nah.</i>

01:26.291 --> 01:27.541
<i>See, I started at the bottom.</i>

01:27.541 --> 01:28.625
1966

01:28.625 --> 01:32.333
<i>I mean the very bottom.
In a grape vineyard in Guasti, California.</i>

01:34.000 --> 01:36.541
<i>Yeah, that little</i> travieso <i>right there.</i>

01:36.541 --> 01:38.500
<i>Actually, one of nine</i> traviesos<i>.</i>

01:38.500 --> 01:41.750
<i>I mean, it was the '60s. We're Mexican.
Of course my parents got down.</i>

01:41.750 --> 01:44.750
<i>See, in my mind,
I was the luckiest kid in the world</i>

01:44.750 --> 01:46.708
<i>with a playground bigger than Disneyland.</i>

01:49.500 --> 01:51.291
Get up! Why are you playing?

01:51.625 --> 01:52.625
Fill this up.

01:52.833 --> 01:54.458
Leave him alone. He's just a boy.

01:54.458 --> 01:57.416
 <i>Except my playground
was everybody else's labor camp.</i>

01:57.416 --> 01:59.041
Hey, give that to me. Go play.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.958
<i>We lived together. We worked together.</i>

02:01.958 --> 02:03.583
<i>And we survived together.</i>

02:03.583 --> 02:06.541
<i>And by the time I was ten,
I knew all I had in life was...</i>

02:06.833 --> 02:08.916
 The Montañez name.

02:09.541 --> 02:13.625
If you can show 'em what a Montañez can do

02:14.083 --> 02:16.583
they can't tell you nothin'.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.083
Don't forget that.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.083
Yes, Grandpa.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.041
I'm a Montañez!

02:21.708 --> 02:22.583
I'm a Montañez!

02:26.208 --> 02:27.416
Yes, you are.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.250
Dinner time.

02:33.458 --> 02:35.083
Leave it there, Richie.

02:35.708 --> 02:38.666
When I fix it, we're gonna call Batman.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.875
-  <i>My dad...</i>

02:43.875 --> 02:48.208
<i>...Vacho Montañez,

02:48.208 --> 02:50.666
Richard. Richard.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.166
Why are you touching my things?!

02:54.958 --> 02:57.583
Leave him alone,
he didn't do anything bad.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.750
<i>School was no better.</i>

03:01.666 --> 03:03.000
<i>Until I met Judy.</i>

03:04.708 --> 03:07.458
<i>Let's just say
us two</i> chiquillos <i>had a lot in common.</i>

03:12.041 --> 03:13.291
Hi.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.333
 Is that your lunch?

03:15.333 --> 03:16.416
Yeah.

03:16.416 --> 03:20.250
Wish it was a bologna sandwich or--
or a <i>chocolate</i>.

03:21.541 --> 03:22.583
 I got a burrito.

03:22.833 --> 03:24.166
Want some?

03:24.166 --> 03:26.666
Ew! What is that? Gross.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.000
It's a bean burrito.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.500
Ha! Figures. Beans for a dirty beaner.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.833
- Let's go, guys.

03:31.833 --> 03:34.666
<i>Judy and I knew we stuck out
like a couple of sore brown thumbs.</i>

03:34.666 --> 03:35.583
 Are you OK?

03:36.375 --> 03:38.416
<i>So we decided to stick together.</i>

03:38.416 --> 03:40.166
<i>Burritos and bullies be damned.</i>

03:41.750 --> 03:44.333
Please, make me a bologna sandwich!

03:45.666 --> 03:47.583
Nobody's making you a bologna sandwich.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.000
I don't want to be different.

03:51.375 --> 03:52.708
Here. One for you...

03:53.541 --> 03:55.333
and one for the idiot
who doesn't like burritos.

03:58.416 --> 04:00.000
Hey. There's the beaner. Ha.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.166
- He's eating it again. Gross. Look.
- Looks like it came out of a toilet.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.875
Aw, I might throw up.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.500
Oh, my God!

04:07.500 --> 04:09.541
So good!

04:09.541 --> 04:11.333
<i>Delicioso.</i>

04:11.333 --> 04:12.416
Want some?

04:12.416 --> 04:14.583
Ew, I'm not gonna eat that!

04:14.583 --> 04:15.666
You eat it.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.000
- I dare you.

04:24.875 --> 04:27.541
- Hey, this is pretty good.
-  I want some. Give me one.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.000
Me first. Give me this one.

04:31.916 --> 04:33.083
Twenty-five cents.

04:36.750 --> 04:37.750
Let's go.

04:37.750 --> 04:41.833
<i>And just like that, I became
the burrito hustler of Guasti Elementary.</i>

04:42.958 --> 04:45.333
<i>Ever heard of a little thing called
"supply and demand"?</i>

04:46.500 --> 04:48.833
-  Whoa! I want one.

04:48.833 --> 04:51.500
<i>Man, Taco Bell didn't introduce
the world to burritos.</i>

04:51.500 --> 04:53.000
<i>Me and my mama did.</i>

04:53.500 --> 04:55.625
<i>Well, at least
that's what it felt like to me.</i>

05:00.291 --> 05:04.083
<i>I wasn't gonna let another day go by
where Judy ate a sad sack lunch.</i>

05:04.583 --> 05:05.750
HERSHEY'S

05:05.750 --> 05:08.208
<i>My Jude wanted chocolate,
and she was gonna get it.</i>

05:09.916 --> 05:11.208
You better have money for that.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.416
Where'd you steal that from, huh, boy?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.041
<i>Here's how this</i> bronca <i>could've gone.</i>

05:22.041 --> 05:23.625
Gee, mister!

05:23.625 --> 05:25.875
I made that money on my newspaper route.

05:25.875 --> 05:29.375
No funny business here.
Just a kid with a girl to impress.

05:29.375 --> 05:32.333
Well, look at this fine,
upstanding young citizen here, huh?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.250
- Wow!
-  Huh?

05:35.250 --> 05:37.166
You go get that girl, son.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.166
And you know what?
Have some free candy on the house.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.291
- Ooh.

05:41.291 --> 05:42.500
Ah, good-looking kid.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.041
- Yeah, smart too.
- Yeah.

05:45.916 --> 05:47.791
<i>But I wasn't a white kid.</i>

05:48.375 --> 05:49.375
<i>I was brown.</i>

05:52.916 --> 05:54.083
Get in.

05:56.833 --> 06:00.625
<i>And when the world treats
you like a criminal, you become one.</i>

06:00.625 --> 06:01.708

06:05.833 --> 06:09.958
<i>Yeah! That's that</i> firme pachuco

06:09.958 --> 06:11.958
<i>I look good!</i>

06:11.958 --> 06:14.458
<i>Now, before you start talking smack about</i>

06:14.458 --> 06:16.958
<i>"why Mexicans always
got to be gangsters," don't.</i>

06:16.958 --> 06:18.916
<i>'Cause I didn't make this up. I lived it.</i>

06:18.916 --> 06:21.500

<i>...to beat your ass in the street

06:25.041 --> 06:26.041
BE BROWN & BE PROUD

06:26.041 --> 06:27.666
<i>To be Chicano meant being invisible...</i>

06:27.666 --> 06:28.708
WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED!

06:28.708 --> 06:30.250
<i>...but still getting a beatdown.</i>

06:30.250 --> 06:32.375
<i>And if</i> la jura <i>wasn't beating your ass,</i>

06:32.375 --> 06:35.500
<i>you were getting shipped off to war
to drop like flies.</i>

06:38.916 --> 06:40.833
<i>I was just trying to survive.</i>

06:40.833 --> 06:42.125
<i>And Judy?</i>

06:42.125 --> 06:43.875
<i>She was surviving too.</i>

06:44.666 --> 06:46.708
<i>And we were real good at surviving.</i>

06:46.708 --> 06:48.166
<i>Together.</i>

06:51.416 --> 06:53.708
<i>The Chicano Movement was in full effect,</i>

06:53.708 --> 06:55.541
<i>but I wasn't paying attention.</i>

06:55.541 --> 06:57.708
<i>I had family business to attend to.</i>

06:59.791 --> 07:03.333
<i>You see, my homeys were
the only family I knew, you dig?</i>

07:03.916 --> 07:05.750
<i>We always had each other's backs.</i>

07:06.416 --> 07:07.958
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:08.916 --> 07:10.750
- Don't be pushing my man!

07:12.375 --> 07:13.583
Get her, Judy!

07:14.500 --> 07:15.833
<i>Business was good.</i>

07:16.958 --> 07:18.541
<i>And I was living the life.</i>

2-hour home test for pregnancy

07:22.208 --> 07:26.625
<i>But ignorance is bliss

07:27.208 --> 07:28.875
Rich, you gotta change now.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.250
- For us and for the baby.
- What you talking about?

07:31.250 --> 07:33.291
- Check out this new ride I got us.
- Yeah, exactly!

07:33.291 --> 07:34.750
Like, where did this car come from?

07:37.916 --> 07:41.083
Rich, if I am sitting in a stolen car,
I swear--

07:41.083 --> 07:42.375
It's on a layaway plan.

07:42.958 --> 07:44.708
- Are you kidding me right now?

07:44.708 --> 07:47.041
Why do you keep doing stuff like this
all the time?

07:49.250 --> 07:50.458
Look at me, son.

07:50.958 --> 07:54.000
You're not worthless, Richard.
Do you hear me?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.666
You're not stupid.

07:55.666 --> 07:59.208
You've got a brain between those ears,
not just that dumb mustache.

07:59.208 --> 08:03.083
You're not your father,
but you will be if you don't change.

08:03.833 --> 08:07.541
If you don't wake up, you're gonna
end up in a cell or in the ground.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.625
We can't lose you, Rich.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.291
And I think you can do better.

08:15.375 --> 08:18.250
<i>Man, it's a miracle
he didn't throw the book at me.</i>

08:18.250 --> 08:21.083
Hey, yo, Richie! Richie!

08:21.666 --> 08:22.750
Hey, <i>vato</i>!

08:23.583 --> 08:24.583
You ready to leave?

08:24.583 --> 08:26.083
Let's go, homey!

08:29.208 --> 08:30.791
Let's go!

08:36.625 --> 08:38.541
<i>You see, life is about choices.</i>

08:40.291 --> 08:41.375
<i>Big ones.</i>

08:47.333 --> 08:49.583
<i>It was time for me
to choose something better.</i>

08:50.166 --> 08:51.166

08:51.166 --> 08:52.958
<i>But better doesn't always mean easier.</i>

08:52.958 --> 08:55.041
We can't fix that right now.
We don't have time.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.791
-  This thing's stuck.

08:56.791 --> 08:58.666
This wire is corroded.
What the hell?

08:58.666 --> 09:01.166
Yes, <i>amor</i>. Are you hungry?

09:03.833 --> 09:07.041
<i>Amá. Amá</i>, look.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.250
I know, baby. I know.

09:12.708 --> 09:13.833
Here. Chew.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.666
You gotta hurry up, baby.
We're gonna be late.

09:17.666 --> 09:18.791
Yeah, yeah.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.375
- How the heck...
- Spit.

09:20.958 --> 09:22.833
- Put your leg up.
-  I think I got it.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.375
Okay, I think I got it.

09:24.875 --> 09:27.250
All right, go. Go wait in the <i>sala</i>.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.125
Yes, Mexicans can!

09:33.125 --> 09:34.708
I fixed it.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.583
Baby, that sounded really bad.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.916
Bad? Nah.
No, the fridge is just taking a nap.

09:41.916 --> 09:44.458
- The food is gonna spoil. Come on.
- The food will be fine.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.708
What are we gonna do?

09:45.708 --> 09:47.375
- When are we gonna have time to fix it?
- Hey.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.208
- We can't afford another.
- Look at me.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.666
- What are we gonna do?
- Breathe.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.541
Three.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.041
Two.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.541
One.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.708
-  Breathe.
- Breathe.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.416
Someone's gonna say "yes" today.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.250
Yeah.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.708
I got this.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.000
<i>And I did have this.</i>

10:09.000 --> 10:12.125
-<i>Judy even made me a fancy résumé.</i>
- Excuse me. Hey, man. How are you?

10:12.125 --> 10:14.708
<i>'Cause who's gonna say "no" to something
that sounds so French?</i>

10:14.708 --> 10:17.000
- We don't got no work, bro.
- Now, I can mow lawns.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.500
I can hedge the bushes.
I'll clean out the equipment.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.958
- Whatever you need.
- Sorry, man. My crew's full.

10:22.541 --> 10:25.291
Here's my number. Just call me anytime
if something opens up.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.750
Excuse me.
Do you know where they might be hiring?

10:28.416 --> 10:30.083
My father and grandfather
were farmworkers.

10:30.083 --> 10:33.416
I was too when I was a kid so,
I-- I remember well.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.041
If you could just take my résumé.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.125
-  No, thanks.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.708
-  No, thank you.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.958
Here's my résumé.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.750
And I'll do anything.
I'll wash dishes. Whatever.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.125
Don't hold your breath.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.916
- There you go.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.458
Some people call it juvie.
I call it summer camp.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.166

11:07.250 --> 11:08.875
We ain't hiring.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.500
You just don't look like the kind of guy
who's got an ounce of initiative.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.333
What kind of guy does that look like?

11:15.250 --> 11:17.083
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! That's my car.

11:17.083 --> 11:20.250
Don't do that! You have respect

Hey, hey, hey!

11:21.291 --> 11:23.625
- You understand me?
- Get your hands off my kid!

11:23.625 --> 11:25.083
Don't be talking to him like that.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.791
Good Lord! You women pump
these wetbacks out like a factory.

11:28.791 --> 11:32.125
- What did you just say?
- Hey! Hey! You touch my kid?

11:32.125 --> 11:34.000
- Leave it, Rich.
- What do you mean, "leave it"?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.500
Yes, leave it! The police will come,
and that's not good for us.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.916
Mommy?

11:37.916 --> 11:39.583
What's a wetback?

11:41.375 --> 11:43.625
It's okay, baby.
You didn't do anything wrong.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.291
- Okay.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.083
- I know.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.541
We need to go in at some point, babe.

11:54.416 --> 11:55.458
I really don't want to.

11:55.458 --> 11:56.625
The kids need to eat.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.250
- We have food at home.
- No, we don't.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.625
The fridge just broke. We don't have work.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.125
You think I don't know that?

12:05.208 --> 12:08.083
Tortillas can't pay the bills,
and our kids have shoes that talk.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.208
We need help.

12:10.291 --> 12:13.041
Please just suck it up,
and let's go into Vacho's.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.750
Can't your sister get you more shifts
at the store?

12:24.333 --> 12:26.083
She tried ama, but there's no more shifts.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.125
 You know what?

12:27.625 --> 12:29.833
It's not your job
to provide for your family.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.625
It's this <i>menso</i>'s job.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.166
What's the matter with you, huh?

12:35.166 --> 12:37.000
Letting your woman work so much.

12:37.708 --> 12:40.541
If you'd read the Bible, you'd know it's
a man's job to provide for his family.

12:40.541 --> 12:42.041
<i>You heard that right. God.</i>

12:42.041 --> 12:44.500
<i>Vacho got saved about five years ago.</i>

12:44.500 --> 12:47.083
<i>He replaced the gin and juice
with some Jesus juice.</i>

12:47.833 --> 12:50.458
You need to set an example for your kid.
Ain't that right, <i>mijo</i>?

12:51.458 --> 12:53.708
He looked for work today, didn't you mijo?

12:53.708 --> 12:56.750
Yes. We both have. There's
just no work for anybody right now.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.416
Oh, there's work out there.
There's always work out there.

13:00.041 --> 13:02.833
Problem is, all they see is a good-
for-nothing gangster when they see you.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.166
- Mm-hmm.
- If you gave your life to the Lord,

13:05.166 --> 13:07.208
you would see how fast
the help would come, <i>mijo</i>.

13:07.208 --> 13:10.875
Well, last time I checked, Jesus was poor,
<i>prieto</i> and powerless like me.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.333
And he did some pretty gangster shit.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.250
You wanna be a good husband
and father or what, <i>huevón</i>?

13:17.708 --> 13:20.250
Light this and say a prayer. It'll help.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.875
<i>Ya, Concha.</i>
Stop it with the candle, huh?

13:23.750 --> 13:25.791
- Ain't no candle gonna fix him.
-  Okay, Vacho.

13:25.791 --> 13:27.125
He needs to fix himself.

13:27.125 --> 13:29.833
Thank you, Concha. At this point,
I'll put my faith in anything.

13:29.833 --> 13:33.250
How about you forget about the stupid
candle and have a little faith in me, huh?

13:33.250 --> 13:34.750
Rich, are you serious?

13:46.083 --> 13:48.166
<i>It felt like I had no choice.</i>

13:48.875 --> 13:50.916
<i>I had to go back to what I knew best.</i>

13:52.333 --> 13:56.708
<i>And if I wanted to start selling again,
I had to check in with the old crew.</i>

14:11.666 --> 14:13.875
<i>Órale.</i> What's up, homeboy?

14:13.875 --> 14:16.166
-  What's up?
- It's the big dog.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.166
You finally back for more business, <i>ese</i>?

14:19.166 --> 14:20.541
Depends.

14:20.541 --> 14:21.458
Oh, yeah?

14:21.458 --> 14:23.166
Oh, shit, Richard's back?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.458
- 'Sup? <i>Órale.</i>
- I got you, homey.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.583
Hey, check it out.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.208
This <i>vato</i> right here
could sell water to a whale, <i>carnal</i>.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.166
The baddest salesman on the block, homey.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.333
Nah.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.083
Richard's good.

14:39.416 --> 14:41.125
<i>Every hood has a big brother.</i>

14:41.125 --> 14:42.458
<i>The jefe.</i>

14:42.458 --> 14:44.583
<i>The</i> vato <i>who runs everything on the block.</i>

14:45.208 --> 14:47.333
<i>That was Tony Romero.</i>

14:47.333 --> 14:49.125
Listen, Tony, I know what I'm doing.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.625
No, you don't. 'Cause you got babies.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.250
You don't need to sling nothing.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.416
Hey, man,
if he wants to deal, let him deal.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.083
Yeah, homes,
we don't all got fancy factory jobs

14:58.083 --> 14:59.958
with benefits and stupid hairnets.

14:59.958 --> 15:02.208
Frito factory.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.541
- You working at Frito-Lay?
-  Yeah.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.541
So, what?

15:07.291 --> 15:09.500
- Well, hook me up with a job.
-  This fool.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.583
- What?

15:11.583 --> 15:14.000
They hired this Mexican
Hulk-Hogan-looking <i>pendejo</i>.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.083
Why not me?

15:15.083 --> 15:17.375
<i>Este vato</i>, man.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.708
You really wanna do this, punk? Huh?

15:21.708 --> 15:23.833
I'm gonna give you
a <i>putazo en la madre</i>, fool.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.333
Tony, I just need a job, man.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.208
Go get an application.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.291
Who's stopping you?

15:31.166 --> 15:32.791
Just put in a good word.

15:34.041 --> 15:35.875
Like you said, I got kids.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.166
I'll see what I can do.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.750
Hey,
forget about that dude at the store, <i>mijo</i>.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.958
You know you're a good kid, right?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.291
Yeah, I know.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.583
Let's check it out.

16:01.583 --> 16:02.916
Put your arm out.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.666
This?

16:07.333 --> 16:08.416
We're the same.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.083
If I'm good, you're good.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.791
No matter what anybody says.

16:15.791 --> 16:17.125
Understand?

16:18.458 --> 16:20.416
Can we just watch TV, <i>Apá</i>?

16:21.583 --> 16:22.625
Sure, <i>mijo</i>.

16:23.125 --> 16:26.541
<i>There's a reason why
poor people always talking about God.</i>

16:26.541 --> 16:28.208
<i>'Cause when you don't got nothing,</i>

16:28.208 --> 16:32.291
<i>the guy promising you everything
starts to sound pretty good.</i>

16:32.291 --> 16:33.875
Frito Lay

16:36.000 --> 16:37.500
Frito Lay

16:45.958 --> 16:47.583
Excuse me. Sorry.

16:47.583 --> 16:49.125
Um, hi.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.041
Um, my name is Richard Montañez.
I'm coming to bring a résumé.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.416
We don't take résumés.
You have to fill out an application.

16:54.416 --> 16:56.875
And before you ask, no,
we don't have it in Spanish.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.333
Okay, thanks.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.750
Frito Lay - PEPSICO
APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT

17:22.083 --> 17:24.333
PLEASE READ EACH STATEMENT
CAREFULLY BEFORE SIGNING

17:30.333 --> 17:31.833
Here's my application.

17:37.958 --> 17:40.708
EDUCATION - Have you received
a high school diploma or its equivalent?

17:44.625 --> 17:48.833
Hi, um, you think it'd be okay
if I brought this back later?

17:49.416 --> 17:50.916
Probably a good idea, hon.

17:53.666 --> 17:54.875
Thank you.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.166
Pen.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.750
Oh. Sorry.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.541
Baby!

18:00.541 --> 18:01.833
Sofía got fired.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.625
Because she was fooling around, yet again.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.083
So, guess who gets all
of her shifts at the store? This girl!

18:08.083 --> 18:12.500
So, I got us
the name-brand cornflakes to celebrate.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.083
Hey, what's wrong?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.208
Baby, what's "initiative" mean?

18:19.208 --> 18:23.750
It means, uh, s-someone who can
take charge without being asked. Why?

18:24.583 --> 18:26.458
Do I look like a guy who's got initiative?

18:27.958 --> 18:29.625
What is it? Tell me.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.666
High school diploma.

18:34.416 --> 18:35.958
You're applying to Frito-Lay?

18:35.958 --> 18:37.708
Yeah, but I got to be
a high school graduate,

18:37.708 --> 18:39.166
and I can barely read the application.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.416
No, baby, that's okay. I'll help you.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.750
I need my wife to help me
fill out the application.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.958
God, what an idiot.

18:46.958 --> 18:48.750
Hey! Stop it.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.583
Screw the diploma. Can you do the job?

18:50.583 --> 18:52.125
Yeah, I think so.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.166
Can you?

18:54.750 --> 18:56.125
Yes, I can.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.541
Okay, well, guess what?

18:58.541 --> 19:02.291
You graduated
from San Bernardino High School.

19:02.916 --> 19:04.291
Class of '71.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.625
Yeah?

19:05.625 --> 19:07.500
With honors. What's up?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.500
Okay, <i>papi</i>, let's not get crazy.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.333
Come on. They ain't gonna know.

19:14.916 --> 19:18.041
So, Tony says you're a good guy.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.125
Yeah, I hope so.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.166
You fill this out?

19:24.666 --> 19:25.791
Yeah.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.583
You write like a girl.

19:28.583 --> 19:29.583
Thank you.

19:29.583 --> 19:32.000
San Bernardino High, huh? I went there.

19:32.625 --> 19:33.625
You did?

19:33.625 --> 19:35.708
Remember Principal Grimaldi?

19:35.708 --> 19:37.125
Tough. Annoying.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.875
Heck, yeah, man.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.666
I hated that guy.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.333
Principal Grimaldi is a woman.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.041
Yea-Yeah, but she was like--

19:47.041 --> 19:50.625
She was like-- like a woman
who felt like one of the guys.

19:51.416 --> 19:52.458
Okay.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.208
- All right.
- Look, um, sir!

19:55.208 --> 19:57.500
Look, I'm fast. I'm smart.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.458
I-- I know I don't look it,

19:59.458 --> 20:01.916
but I promise
I'll be the best worker you ever hired.

20:01.916 --> 20:05.375
Look, maybe I don't got no diploma,
but I got a PhD.

20:05.375 --> 20:08.791
- Hmm?
- I'm poor, hungry and determined, sir.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.250
Oh, well, that's just stupid.

20:14.583 --> 20:15.833
Fine.

20:15.833 --> 20:18.250
Honestly, most of the Mexicans here
work pretty dang hard.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.375
It's a janitor gig. What's the worst
you could do? Break a mop?

20:21.375 --> 20:22.458
But I won't.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.708
<i>For the first time in years...</i>

20:26.708 --> 20:27.791
Montanez

20:27.791 --> 20:29.833
<i>...this</i> chavo <i>had a legit grown-up job.</i>

20:30.333 --> 20:31.666
<i>See, fools were jealous.</i>

20:31.666 --> 20:33.666
<i>Shoot, I was jealous of me.</i>

20:35.875 --> 20:37.375
Frito Lay - Montanez

20:44.458 --> 20:48.333
All right, you punch in on time.
You punch out on time. No exceptions.

20:48.333 --> 20:49.666
This here is the main pit.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.708
Cornmeal goes in that extruder,
through the oven.

20:52.708 --> 20:55.916
Chips cool down in this tumbler.
Lots of grease. You'll be scrubbing that.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.333
Right there are the fryers.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.458
You're gonna change the oil
on those every two days.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.458
Make sure you scrub the exterior too

21:01.458 --> 21:04.458
because it'll drip like a son of a gun
and muck up the floors.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.000
Could cause a lawsuit.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.000
And I don't need
a stinking lawsuit, got it?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.583
This here is the main walkway.

21:10.583 --> 21:14.458
Lot of forklifts
and traffic moving around, so be careful.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.208
<i>It was crazy.
Like a city of machines.</i>

21:17.208 --> 21:19.375
<i>It was</i> firme<i>.</i>

21:20.458 --> 21:23.125
<i>This</i> moreno <i>was finally part of something.</i>

21:23.125 --> 21:24.583
<i>Something big.</i>

21:24.583 --> 21:27.250
Here the chips are sorted,
weighed and bagged.

21:27.250 --> 21:30.708
Underneath there, those conveyors,
I want you to scrub right up under that.

21:30.708 --> 21:33.833
These bins are gonna wanna be
emptied out every hour.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.666
Main trash bin is outside there
on the loading dock.

21:36.666 --> 21:39.166
But, basically, don't get in anyone's way.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.583
Montañez! Hey, you "comprende-ing"?

21:44.583 --> 21:46.083
Yes, sir!

21:46.083 --> 21:49.791
Cornmeal shooter, oil lawsuits,
every bin, every hour.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.333
I'll be the best dumper you ever had.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.208
Okay, I can see
you're gonna be a weird one.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.916
All right, this here is Nacho.
Nacho. Richard.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.083
Nacho will fill you in on anything
I didn't explain.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.791
- Good luck.
- What do you need help with?

22:00.791 --> 22:03.916
<i>Packaging operator,
you're needed on the floor, please.</i>

22:03.916 --> 22:06.000
<i>Packaging operator,
you're needed on the floor.</i>

22:06.000 --> 22:07.083
Wow!

22:07.625 --> 22:09.458
Hey, this is so cool. Have you seen this?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.750
 Calm down, Rich. Easy.

22:17.875 --> 22:19.208
Hey!

22:20.500 --> 22:22.125
I got you. That's too heavy for you, <i>vato</i>.

22:22.125 --> 22:24.916
-  <i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>
-  All right.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.916
<i>Amá</i>, Dad's home!

22:30.916 --> 22:34.666
Oh, my gosh! Baby, how did it go?
Did they like you? I was praying all day.

22:34.666 --> 22:37.333
<i>Apá</i>, they gave you free Cheetos?

22:37.333 --> 22:39.708
You know white people
don't give you no free nothing.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.041
Plus...

22:42.708 --> 22:45.708
-  What we got, babe?
-<i>Arroz con quesadillas.</i>

22:45.708 --> 22:46.791
Mmm.

22:46.791 --> 22:49.541
We always eat the same thing.

22:49.541 --> 22:52.833
Hey! You like my quesadillas. Here. Eat.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.666
Hey.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.000
-  You proud of your man?
- Maybe.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.166
Start bringing home free food,
and I'll think about it.

23:00.166 --> 23:02.125
-<i>Chale.</i>

23:04.625 --> 23:07.583
Babe, you got that candle burning 24-7.
You're gonna burn down the house.

23:07.583 --> 23:10.333
Hey! What are you doing?
So, you trying to get fired?

23:10.333 --> 23:11.750
- I don't think so.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.041
-  Brat. Stop it.
- What? It's so windy in here.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.875
-  I'm gonna get you!

23:15.875 --> 23:18.083
- Stop it!
- I won't do it.

23:18.083 --> 23:19.333
TIME CLOCK

23:33.958 --> 23:34.958
Hey, that was fun, man.

23:34.958 --> 23:38.458
I've never used a power washer before.
I didn't know they could clean like that.

23:38.458 --> 23:41.166
You know what? I think if we used vinegar,
it would do really well.

23:41.166 --> 23:42.708
Vin-- Judy has this-- You know what?

23:42.708 --> 23:44.750
I think she used baking soda.
That's what it is.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.000
Oh, hey!

23:52.000 --> 23:54.750
So, you're telling me
that the cornmeal mixes with the water,

23:54.750 --> 23:57.333
goes into that machine, is like, "Poof!"

23:57.333 --> 23:59.041
Comes out shaped like a Cheeto?

24:01.458 --> 24:02.875
But, like, how?

24:02.875 --> 24:04.166
Is it, um--

24:05.083 --> 24:06.541
Is it the heat plus the pressure?

24:08.083 --> 24:11.000
Don't you got a mop to flirt with
instead of me, Paco?

24:11.583 --> 24:13.666
-  <i>Man, I know guys like this.</i>
- Okay.

24:13.666 --> 24:15.375
<i>I've dealt with them my whole life.</i>

24:16.875 --> 24:19.708
-  Oh, yeah, Richard! Yeah!

24:19.708 --> 24:21.708
-  <i>Nah, just kidding.</i>

24:22.833 --> 24:25.416
<i>What'd you think?
This is my first week on the job.</i>

24:25.416 --> 24:27.000
<i>I had to mind my gangster.</i>

24:33.041 --> 24:35.083
Yeah, it's the heat plus the pressure.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.000
Collets look good to you, Baker?

24:40.958 --> 24:41.958
Yeah.

24:44.625 --> 24:47.625
Is that what they call the "temp levels,"
or is that part of the machine?

24:47.625 --> 24:50.333
Nah, man. The doodles, bro.
The Cheeto doodles are the collets.

24:50.916 --> 24:53.041
Oh, nice.
Hey, it's wild, isn't it?

24:53.041 --> 24:55.500
How all these gauges and gadgets
make a bunch of doodles.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.583
Montañez!

24:57.333 --> 25:00.500
Come on. The extruder's caked
in cheese dust. Clean it out!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.708
It's Montañez, sir!

25:08.583 --> 25:09.833
You got a cool job, brother!

25:11.750 --> 25:13.666
Yes, I do, brother.

25:13.666 --> 25:15.166
I'm an engineer.

25:15.708 --> 25:16.708
Self-made.

25:16.708 --> 25:18.000
For real?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.083
For real.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.166
Hey, hold up!

25:35.583 --> 25:37.708
You push all them buttons
like you're a superhero.

25:37.708 --> 25:39.291
Like pa-pa-pow!

25:41.458 --> 25:42.666
Hey, I'm Richard.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.833
Richard Montañez.

25:46.583 --> 25:47.583
Clarence C. Baker.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.000
<i>Órale.</i>

25:49.000 --> 25:51.208
- Pleasure to meet you, <i>hermano</i>.
- Mm-hmm.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.541
Hey, what's the "C" stand for?

25:53.125 --> 25:54.416
Charisma.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Oh, okay.

25:59.916 --> 26:01.541
Hey, I got a question.

26:01.541 --> 26:03.541
You think there might be a way
that I can look at--

26:03.541 --> 26:05.166
Man, I don't even know what it's called.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.875
It's, like, a diorama
or a diagram of this machine.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.458
Now, why would you wanna learn
about a machine I run, boy?

26:11.166 --> 26:13.583
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Uh, my bad, Clarence.

26:13.583 --> 26:16.666
The janitor got a little lost.
He was just looking for the cafeteria.

26:16.666 --> 26:19.000
- Just come on.
-  I was just talking to him, man.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Richie, don't be talking
to people like that, homey.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.791
This here's like high school, <i>menso</i>.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.000
The mean guys
ain't trying to talk to no janitor.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.458
I never been to high school.
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:28.458 --> 26:29.875
-  Come on, man.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.500
New guy's already messing up?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.791
Oh, yeah! He's talking to Clarence
like he knows the guy.

26:33.791 --> 26:36.916
- You already met Nacho. This is Hector.
- Hey.

26:36.916 --> 26:38.291
- That's Alejandro.
- How you guys doing?

26:38.291 --> 26:40.666
-  Pass me the salsa, yeah.

26:41.250 --> 26:42.291
 Can I have one?

26:42.416 --> 26:44.541
I don't like the green one, bro. <i>Gracias.</i>

26:44.541 --> 26:47.291
-  You're gonna eat it all.
- The meat doesn't taste like anything.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.375
Here's what you need to know
if you're gonna survive around here.

26:50.375 --> 26:53.458
The guys at that table,
those are the plant managers.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.833
Calm, confident.

26:55.833 --> 26:58.708
They got white picket fences and 401(k)s.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.791
<i>They got money, champagne,</i>

27:00.791 --> 27:04.583
<i>and no worries
because they got the cushy, safe jobs.</i>

27:04.583 --> 27:06.708
<i>Then, there's the floor managers.</i>

27:06.708 --> 27:10.916
<i>They ain't got no job security,
but they got all the responsibility.</i>

27:10.916 --> 27:12.291
- God dang it!

27:12.291 --> 27:14.500
<i>Poor bastards are bitter
because they gotta answer</i>

27:14.500 --> 27:17.333
<i>to the guys above them
who do less and make more.</i>

27:17.333 --> 27:20.416
Y luego<i>, the machine operators.</i>

27:20.416 --> 27:23.916
<i>Blue-collar but proud.
They get everybody's respect.</i>

27:23.916 --> 27:26.708
<i>And Clarence, he's the best of them all.</i>

27:26.708 --> 27:28.791
<i>Homey's been here longer than anybody.</i>

27:29.208 --> 27:31.125
 Poor guy. So hardworking.

27:31.375 --> 27:32.916
Yeah, but why is that bad?

27:32.916 --> 27:35.583
'Cause the <i>compa</i> has been trying
to get from that table

27:35.583 --> 27:39.083
to that table for 15 years.

27:39.083 --> 27:42.083
Half those <i>cabrónes</i> at the top learned
everything they know from Clarence.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.916
There's a reason he doesn't like
getting questions about his machines.

27:44.916 --> 27:47.458
-<i>Exacto.</i>
- And then, you got us.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.666
Lowest of the low.

27:49.666 --> 27:53.625
- The assembly line, packing--
-  Speak for yourself, homey.

27:53.625 --> 27:55.416
Us drivers are elite status.

27:55.583 --> 27:58.333
 Shut up, Mr. Clean!

27:58.333 --> 28:00.000
Ooh! <i>Ay, güey. Órale.</i>

28:00.000 --> 28:01.583
And then there's you two.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.875
- Bottom-feeders. The janitors.

28:04.125 --> 28:05.458
 I'm not a bottom feeder.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.500
Guys like you can't be
talking to a guy like Clarence.

28:09.125 --> 28:10.833
'Cause we don't break rank around here.

28:10.833 --> 28:12.000
<i>Entiendes?</i>

28:12.000 --> 28:13.166
It's about respect.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.583
And guys like you and me,
we don't get shots like this.

28:15.583 --> 28:16.666
So don't blow it.

28:16.666 --> 28:19.333
'Cause I'm not going back
to that life, <i>carnal</i>.

28:19.333 --> 28:20.666
Are you?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.375
You should see the machines.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.750
Oh, and I got my own little office
<i>y todo, Amá</i>.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.041
 That's nice, mijo.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.750
An office, huh?
You mean more like a closet, <i>que no</i>?

28:39.375 --> 28:41.166
Where you stuff the cleaning supplies.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.750
Man, it ain't no closet.

28:43.458 --> 28:45.791
Nacho and I share a desk in there.
We got a phone and everything.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.833
Ah, still a dead end, <i>sangrón</i>.

28:47.833 --> 28:49.166
It's a job.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.666
Provide for my family.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.750
Yeah, for how long?

28:53.291 --> 28:54.791
Until you change your insides,

28:54.791 --> 28:56.458
you're gonna keep
making the same mistakes.

28:56.458 --> 28:58.500
You can't spend
the rest of your life scrubbing floors

28:58.500 --> 28:59.958
and cleaning up after people.

28:59.958 --> 29:02.708
<i>I would never say
Vacho was right, but he wasn't wrong.</i>

29:02.708 --> 29:04.958
<i>I didn't wanna mop floors my whole life.</i>

29:04.958 --> 29:07.000
<i>I was working hard to get to the top.</i>

29:07.500 --> 29:08.791
<i>And you know who was at the top?</i>

29:08.791 --> 29:09.875
Team Pepsi

29:09.875 --> 29:11.375
<i>That</i> vato <i>right there. Roger Enrico.</i>

29:11.375 --> 29:12.875
PAVING THE WAY TO
COLA WAR VICTORY

29:12.875 --> 29:15.916
<i>He ran PepsiCo,
which ran Frito-Lay, which ran us.</i>

29:15.916 --> 29:17.000
The Pepsi Challenge

29:17.000 --> 29:19.541
<i>He created the Pepsi Generation
and a blind taste test challenge</i>

29:19.541 --> 29:21.750
<i>that became
a national marketing sensation.</i>

29:21.750 --> 29:26.583
<i>This</i> vato <i>is the only guy to almost take
down Coca-Cola in nearly 100 years.</i>

29:26.583 --> 29:28.583
<i>Pepsi was ballin' thanks to this G.</i>

29:29.958 --> 29:33.416
<i>If I was gonna get to the top,
I needed to learn from the best.</i>

29:33.416 --> 29:36.208
<i>And Clarence? Clarence was the best.</i>

29:36.208 --> 29:37.833
<i>See, I couldn't mess around.</i>

29:37.833 --> 29:41.041
<i>I needed to pull out the big guns.</i>
Los cuetes<i>, baby.</i>

29:41.041 --> 29:42.916
You want carnitas or asada?

29:44.625 --> 29:45.625
Flank steak?

29:47.166 --> 29:48.166
Asada?

29:48.166 --> 29:49.291
Asada.

29:54.416 --> 29:56.041
Okay, what do you want?

29:56.916 --> 29:58.916
I wanna say that I respect your work, sir.

29:59.666 --> 30:01.875
Uh, that I respect that you're self-made.

30:02.458 --> 30:03.625
An engineer.

30:05.583 --> 30:06.666
I wanna learn from you.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.083
Look, my father ain't worth nothing,

30:10.083 --> 30:12.375
but he taught me a lot
about fixing stuff as a kid.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.875
So, I got a thing for machines.

30:14.875 --> 30:19.375
Like when I learn them and fix them
and run 'em, it makes me feel like--

30:20.750 --> 30:23.500
I don't know. Like I ain't a nobody.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.583
Maybe even like I am a somebody.

30:26.708 --> 30:31.291
Somebody that gives out respect
to people he's barely met

30:32.083 --> 30:33.250
and haven't even earned it?

30:35.166 --> 30:38.125
'Cause I ain't that kinda somebody.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.541
<i>Dang,
if I was gonna learn anything here,</i>

30:40.541 --> 30:41.833
<i>it was gonna be from this guy.</i>

30:41.833 --> 30:44.916
<i>But he was shut up tighter
than a jar of chipotles.</i>

30:44.916 --> 30:46.041
Right.

30:47.958 --> 30:49.750
You got some salsa or what?

30:51.291 --> 30:52.333
Yeah.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.666
-  What are we talkin'? Spicy?
-  Oh, yeah.

30:57.666 --> 30:59.625
-  Good.
-  Be careful with that one.

30:59.625 --> 31:03.208
<i>Clarence C. Baker.
He was respected and smart as hell.</i>

31:03.208 --> 31:06.166
<i>And get this, his middle name
really was Charisma.</i>

31:06.166 --> 31:08.958
All right. Got your machine all shiny,
Mr. Baker. What ya think?

31:09.958 --> 31:10.958
You missed the vent.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.041
- What?

31:13.041 --> 31:14.166
Dang.

31:22.166 --> 31:23.166
 Don't touch that.

31:23.416 --> 31:24.416
Richie!

31:25.083 --> 31:26.375
Hey, Mr. Baker. Sir!

31:26.375 --> 31:30.125
I was reviewing the extruder protocols,
and it looks like this gauge is off.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.750
- Do you want me to adjust it? I know how.
- No, no, no, no.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.291
This gauge ain't off.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.875
Hmm. Must've been Alejandro
touchin' my dang machine again.

31:42.625 --> 31:43.625
Thanks.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.750
Hey, Clarence, some of these chips
are looking overcooked.

31:51.750 --> 31:53.083
Should the heat be adjusted?

31:53.958 --> 31:57.000
Nah, brown ones
are separated and then tossed.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.833
They just trash 'em?

31:59.833 --> 32:01.250
Dang.

32:02.708 --> 32:04.791
People always trying
to throw away the brown ones.

32:08.958 --> 32:11.541
Montañez, you missed a spot.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.125
Watch yourself, Carson.

32:15.416 --> 32:17.375
I'm always missin' a spot.

32:19.541 --> 32:20.541
Hey.

32:21.250 --> 32:22.625
Leave it.

32:23.625 --> 32:24.875
Come with me.

32:25.666 --> 32:26.708
Stand right there...

32:29.250 --> 32:30.458
...and listen.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.375
Gasket's loose in station seven.

32:42.958 --> 32:45.000
That's all I got to do, is listen.

32:45.583 --> 32:51.250
I can tell you which machine,
belt, drum, valve or motor that's off.

32:51.250 --> 32:55.083
All by keeping my mouth shut
and listening.

33:02.333 --> 33:03.333
I can't hear it.

33:04.166 --> 33:06.583
Oh, you will when I'm done with you.

33:08.416 --> 33:10.458
You ain't a nobody, son.

33:15.791 --> 33:16.791
<i>Heck yeah.</i>

33:16.791 --> 33:18.833
<i>I was officially his protégé.</i>

33:19.541 --> 33:22.875
<i>But I had to learn it on my own time,
before and after my shifts.</i>

33:22.875 --> 33:24.083
<i>But it didn't matter.</i>

33:24.083 --> 33:26.958
<i>I was ready.
I knew I could do more and be more.</i>

33:26.958 --> 33:28.666
- Hey, I got to go.
- Wait, why?

33:28.666 --> 33:30.333
Your shift doesn't start till later.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.708
Because Clarence said
if I got there early,

33:32.708 --> 33:35.291
- he'd show me how to use the tumbler!
- The what?

33:35.291 --> 33:37.708
- Always very small movements.
- Yeah, but I know this.

33:37.708 --> 33:39.583
- How that work?

33:39.583 --> 33:40.666
Stop.

33:43.833 --> 33:46.833
Montañez, you ain't done. Come on.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.750
Yeah! Hey, maybe the wire burned out.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.291
No, it's just oxidized.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.291
Plug it back in.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.750
- Hey, you going on break, brother?
-  Yeah.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.166
I got you. I'll watch your machine.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.000
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

34:04.541 --> 34:06.791
<i>Just when things
were going great for me,</i>

34:07.625 --> 34:10.875
<i>the country's economy went to shit.</i>

34:12.416 --> 34:14.875
 <i>This is</i> NBC Nightly News<i>.</i>

34:14.875 --> 34:15.958
ECONOMIC MESSAGE

34:15.958 --> 34:18.041
<i>This was the day
Ronald Reagan has been waiting for</i>

34:18.041 --> 34:19.375
<i>since he first entered politics.</i>

34:19.375 --> 34:20.458
1984

34:20.458 --> 34:22.875
<i>The day he will announce
that he is slowing down the growth</i>

34:22.875 --> 34:24.291
<i>of the federal government.</i>

34:24.291 --> 34:26.708
<i>Man,
these Reagan years weren't kind to nobody.</i>

34:26.708 --> 34:27.791
1985

34:27.791 --> 34:30.041
<i>Nothing trickling down
to the</i> pobres <i>and</i> prietos <i>like us.</i>

34:30.041 --> 34:32.791
<i>Deep cuts are planned
for programs designed for the poor...</i>

34:32.791 --> 34:33.875
1987

34:33.875 --> 34:36.250
<i>...such as food stamps,
Medicaid, and employment programs.</i>

34:36.250 --> 34:39.250
 <i>I already have a hard time
keeping the roof over my kid's head.</i>

34:39.250 --> 34:40.166
1988 - 1989

34:40.166 --> 34:41.791
<i>Now I'm making too much for food stamps?</i>

34:41.791 --> 34:43.791
<i>How do they expect me to feed my family?</i>

34:43.791 --> 34:46.791
-  <i>The factory was struggling.</i>
-  <i>I can't even afford my rent.</i>

34:46.791 --> 34:47.708
1990 - 1991

34:47.708 --> 34:49.500
<i>I didn't know politics affect people,</i>

34:49.500 --> 34:51.000
<i>especially hardworking people like us.</i>

34:51.000 --> 34:53.125
<i>Hispanics are much poorer now than we were</i>

34:53.125 --> 34:55.541
<i>before the Reagan administration
came into power.</i>

34:55.541 --> 34:57.250
<i>As the years passed around here,</i>

34:57.250 --> 35:00.750
<i>layoffs and shift cuts got more popular
than Koosh balls and parachute pants.</i>

35:00.750 --> 35:02.333
1992

35:02.333 --> 35:08.250
<i>And here I was, eight years later,
in the exact same spot.</i>

35:09.875 --> 35:12.375
<i>Not even. Things were worse.</i>

35:12.375 --> 35:14.083
Yes, you qualify for SNAP.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.625
With dependents, you can siphon off
more than enough food stamps--

35:16.625 --> 35:18.041
Excuse me, what do you mean "siphon"?

35:18.041 --> 35:19.875
- We're hardworking. We both have jobs.
- Stop. Mom.

35:19.875 --> 35:22.041
- We're trying to figure this out.
- Mom, you're embarrassing us!

35:22.041 --> 35:23.791
You're going to make us feel bad
for wanting help?

35:23.791 --> 35:25.833
-  What are we supposed to do?

35:25.833 --> 35:26.916
Hey, hey.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.291
Quiet down, please. Okay?

35:28.291 --> 35:30.125
Quiet down! Hey!

35:30.125 --> 35:32.125
Frito-Lay isn't getting enough orders

35:32.125 --> 35:34.750
to keep both our factory
and Bakersfield open.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.708
So I'm gonna be brutally honest.

35:37.708 --> 35:41.916
Losing bulk orders
to Bakersfield is now lethal.

35:41.916 --> 35:46.333
If we cannot outrun 'em,
we are the ones who will get shut down.

35:46.333 --> 35:47.666
Understand?

35:47.666 --> 35:49.500
Now, let's go! Back to work!

35:49.500 --> 35:51.416
<i>The snack wars were getting serious.</i>

35:51.416 --> 35:54.166
<i>Competition was thick
and market share was shrinking.</i>

35:54.166 --> 35:57.958
<i>You see, Roger Enrico had become the CEO
of PepsiCo, and he didn't mess around.</i>

35:57.958 --> 35:59.041
EXECUTIVE SUITE

35:59.041 --> 36:00.500
<i>So his first order of business...</i>

36:00.500 --> 36:01.583
DRINK PEPSI-COLA

36:01.583 --> 36:05.041
<i>...cut the fat, cut shifts,
shut down factories,</i>

36:05.041 --> 36:07.250
<i>and find the money
to keep this ship moving.</i>

36:07.250 --> 36:11.125
<i>The corporate suite at Frito-Lay felt like
gangsters throwing down in a drug den.</i>

36:11.125 --> 36:15.541
<i>'Cause, let's be real, that's pretty much
what C-suiters are. Gangsters with money.</i>

36:15.541 --> 36:16.666
<i>Enrico was pissed.</i>

36:16.666 --> 36:21.666
<i>He was like,
"You</i> pendejos <i>are out here tellin' me</i>

36:21.666 --> 36:24.958
<i>these little punks
like Nabisco and Eagle Snacks</i>

36:24.958 --> 36:27.291
<i>are getting more</i> feria <i>than us?</i>

36:27.291 --> 36:31.416
<i>Biting off our territory,
and youse</i> estúpidos <i>okay with that?"</i>

36:31.416 --> 36:34.833
<i>And this</i> gabacho <i>was all, "Nah, big homey.</i>

36:34.833 --> 36:39.541
<i>We still got the good stuff.
Cheetos, Fritos, Doritos.</i>

36:39.541 --> 36:40.791
COMPETITOR PRODUCT SALES 91-92

36:40.791 --> 36:43.750
<i>People still dishin' out</i> lana
<i>for the classics, bro."</i>

36:43.750 --> 36:46.541
<i>Then the big homey laid it down,
and he was like,</i>

36:48.041 --> 36:49.708
<i>"For how long?</i>

36:49.708 --> 36:52.791
<i>'Cause we ain't got time, little puppet."</i>

36:52.791 --> 36:55.958
<i>What? You need a chola translator?
All right, I got you.</i>

36:58.583 --> 37:01.041
So, sales are down?

37:02.583 --> 37:04.000
- Yeah.
- Unfortunately.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.083
- Yeah, that's what it looks like.
- Right now.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.791
HUMAN RESOURCES

37:09.791 --> 37:11.583
- Hey, Stephanie.
- Hey, Richard.

37:12.083 --> 37:14.125
Any word on my application
for the machinist job?

37:14.125 --> 37:16.083
Sorry, Richard. There are no openings yet.

37:17.166 --> 37:19.375
Don't worry, hon.
You'll be the first to know. I'll call ya.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.333
- All right.
- Thank you.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.000
<i>Everyone's shifts kept getting cut.</i>

37:22.916 --> 37:26.000
<i>Didn't matter if you were at the top
or the bottom of the food chain.</i>

37:27.500 --> 37:30.708
<i>Hmm, at least I wasn't alone.
We were all struggling.</i>

37:30.708 --> 37:33.875
<i>Struggling to feed our families.
Struggling to keep our homes.</i>

37:33.875 --> 37:35.750
<i>Struggling to save our pride.</i>

37:36.500 --> 37:38.125
<i>So we did what Mexicans do best.</i>

37:38.666 --> 37:40.916
<i>We shoved it down
and tried to keep our heads up,</i>

37:40.916 --> 37:42.416
<i>even while we were drowning.</i>

38:16.958 --> 38:17.958
<i>Apá.</i>

38:19.750 --> 38:20.875
Can't sleep?

38:36.625 --> 38:38.375
Hey, you sure you don't wanna go home?

38:38.375 --> 38:39.583
Nah, man. I'm sure.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.375
Cheetos
CHEESE THAT GOES CRUNCH!

38:41.375 --> 38:43.416
Man, you crazy. I don't work free 99.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.583
Yeah, well, when someone in the factory
needs a shift covered,

38:45.583 --> 38:46.583
who they gonna call?

38:46.583 --> 38:48.000
Ghostbusters.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.458
You got jokes.

38:49.458 --> 38:52.375
They're gonna call the <i>vato loco</i>
who knows how to do everything.

38:56.625 --> 39:00.125
All you got to know, <i>vato loco</i>,
is rotation is the key.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.958
Out with the old, in with the new.

39:02.958 --> 39:04.500
Fritos

39:04.500 --> 39:05.958
They're all old.

39:05.958 --> 39:10.958
Yeah, well, brown neighborhood,
white flavors. Do the math.

COOL RANCH FLAVOR

39:12.125 --> 39:13.583
I mean, who eats Cool Ranch anyway?

39:15.041 --> 39:16.041
Excuse me.

39:20.041 --> 39:21.208
That lady.

39:21.208 --> 39:24.125
We need to focus on the stockholders.
They control the purse strings.

39:24.125 --> 39:27.333
No, it's the regional managers who need
the oars to turn this ship around.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.250
What? The stockholders are chopped liver?

39:29.250 --> 39:31.333
They need answers.
This video should give it to them.

39:31.333 --> 39:34.666
- Everything isn't about the stockholders.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, guys.

39:34.666 --> 39:38.583
I don't need stockholders
or regional managers or scripts.

39:39.250 --> 39:42.166
I'm gonna just speak from the heart today.

39:42.708 --> 39:45.166
Okay? To the people who matter.

39:45.166 --> 39:46.416
Mic's hot.

39:46.416 --> 39:48.000
Gentlemen.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.875
- Three, two, one, let's shoot it.
-  Okay. Ready to roll.

39:52.125 --> 39:55.375
Okay, everybody, we have
some entertainment for today's lunch.

39:56.083 --> 40:00.500
Garza, hey! Give me a hand here.
We've got to plug it in somewhere.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.708
All right.

40:04.208 --> 40:06.375
Yeah, that's the thing.

40:10.541 --> 40:12.041
Okay. Enjoy the show.

40:12.041 --> 40:13.125
PLEASE STAND BY

40:13.125 --> 40:14.333
Hey, man. What's that?

40:14.958 --> 40:18.250
Corporate nonsense.
They make me play this crap all the time.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.791
Watch it. Ignore it. I don't care.

40:23.541 --> 40:26.791
<i>Hello. I'm Roger Enrico,
chairman of Frito-Lay.</i>

40:27.416 --> 40:33.708
<i>I'm sure you're wondering why I'm here
speaking directly to you, our workforce.</i>

40:34.291 --> 40:37.666
<i>You, my friend,
are the heart and soul of this company.</i>

40:37.666 --> 40:41.000
<i>Turns out Enrico sounded
more like Mister Rogers than</i> American Me<i>.</i>

40:41.000 --> 40:43.125
<i>...machines running
and the product moving.</i>

40:43.125 --> 40:49.041
<i>Now, the world, the economy,
the factory is going through a hard time.</i>

40:49.708 --> 40:50.708
<i>I know you've felt it.</i>

40:51.291 --> 40:54.583
<i>But, for every challenge,
there is opportunity.</i>

40:54.583 --> 40:58.541
<i>And this is your opportunity, Richard.</i>

41:02.250 --> 41:05.958
<i>Yeah, you with the broom.
You see anyone else watching?</i>

41:06.916 --> 41:09.208
Me? I'm just a janitor.

41:09.708 --> 41:13.333
<i>So? Show the world what a janitor can do.</i>

41:14.083 --> 41:18.583
<i>Every person can be the difference
between failure and success.</i>

41:19.166 --> 41:24.416
<i>Richard, I want you to think like a CEO.</i>

41:25.500 --> 41:26.500
Think like a CEO.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.458
<i>Stock prices are rising.
And in the foreseeable future...</i>

41:29.458 --> 41:30.791
-<i>...we should get our...</i>

41:37.583 --> 41:38.958
-  <i>Papi!</i>
-  Can't wait.

41:38.958 --> 41:40.083
Hey!

41:40.083 --> 41:42.166
How was your day?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.250
- Good.
- Yeah?

41:44.791 --> 41:47.041
Hey. What the hell happened to you?

41:47.958 --> 41:49.208
Let's just go home.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.041
Nah, not before
I beat these little punks up.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.916
- Hey!
- No, Dad, let's just go home!

41:52.916 --> 41:54.625
Can we get some <i>elotes</i> first?

41:54.625 --> 41:57.750
No! Why do we always gotta do
stupid Mexican stuff?

41:57.750 --> 42:00.041
Hey! What's the matter with you?

42:00.833 --> 42:06.541
Don't look at me. I love <i>elote</i>.
I love beans. I love rice. I love tamales.

42:06.541 --> 42:09.875
He's just mad 'cause kids make fun of him
'cause we're Mexican.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.333
- Man, shut up!
- Hey, you shut up!

42:11.333 --> 42:12.916
- Hey! Knock it off.
- Hey!

42:12.916 --> 42:13.833
Stop.

42:17.041 --> 42:18.041
Is that true?

42:19.666 --> 42:21.541
Are some little pricks picking on you?

42:26.125 --> 42:28.416
Look, there's a lot
we can be embarrassed about.

42:29.166 --> 42:31.375
But being Mexican?
Nah, <i>mijo</i>, that ain't one of 'em.

42:31.375 --> 42:32.791
You're embarrassed.

42:33.708 --> 42:34.875
No, I'm not.

42:36.583 --> 42:39.000
And you know why
they don't want you to be Mexican?

42:39.625 --> 42:41.458
Because they know it's a superpower.

42:43.166 --> 42:46.791
They know that if you are proud of
who you are, that they couldn't stop you.

42:46.791 --> 42:49.250
That they couldn't make you feel
like you're less than them.

42:50.625 --> 42:51.875
Because you're not, <i>mijo</i>.

42:54.541 --> 42:58.291
They know that superpower--
that superpower can knock 'em out.

42:58.791 --> 43:02.416
Like-- Like Superman.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.541
I ain't four no more, Dad.

43:06.541 --> 43:10.458
Plus, no one craps on Superman
like they crap on us.

43:20.291 --> 43:25.375
Come on. We're getting <i>elote</i>. Right now.

43:29.125 --> 43:30.458
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

43:30.958 --> 43:32.083
What is it?

43:32.083 --> 43:33.166
It burns!

43:33.166 --> 43:34.750
Well, stop eating it, dummy.

43:34.750 --> 43:37.333
No! I like it. It burns good.

43:41.625 --> 43:43.000
TACOS

43:55.041 --> 43:57.166
<i>I'd been searching for an answer.</i>

43:57.833 --> 43:58.958
<i>Or a door to open.</i>

43:58.958 --> 44:00.125
CHOLULA HOT SAUCE

44:00.125 --> 44:04.208
<i>And there it was, all around me.</i>

44:05.458 --> 44:08.125
<i>It had been there the entire time.</i>

44:11.333 --> 44:12.541
- Mom!
- Mom!

44:12.541 --> 44:13.833
-  Jude!
- Mommy!

44:14.333 --> 44:15.666
Enrico sent me a video!

44:16.583 --> 44:19.666
The candle was out.
I fixed it, and Enrico sent me a video.

44:20.541 --> 44:21.791
My candle sent you a video?

44:21.791 --> 44:23.000
Yeah!

44:23.791 --> 44:25.875
- Lucky, baby, what happened?

44:25.875 --> 44:28.166
- Nah, nah. He's all right. Eh?
- What?

44:28.166 --> 44:30.958
He's not four anymore.
Plus, we already talked about it.

44:30.958 --> 44:33.333
We're working on his superpowers.

44:33.333 --> 44:36.000
<i>O no?</i> All right. Go get some bowls.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.333
Mommy! We're gonna make Cheeto chips
and save everybody's jobs.

44:39.333 --> 44:41.875
- We just needed time, you, and the recipe.
- Okay.

44:43.583 --> 44:45.458
-  Hey, put this in a bowl.
- Okay.

44:45.458 --> 44:46.583
Get a move on.

44:46.583 --> 44:49.708
And while you do that, Rich,
how do we pay rent? Huh?

44:50.250 --> 44:52.958
How do we buy food? How?
How do we survive?

44:52.958 --> 44:54.458
We'll be okay.

44:54.458 --> 44:56.333
God, baby. I can't do this anymore.

44:56.333 --> 44:58.833
- No, no, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my Gosh.

44:59.458 --> 45:00.625
<i>Cálmate.</i>

45:00.625 --> 45:01.791
Breathe.

45:02.916 --> 45:03.916
Three...

45:05.416 --> 45:07.375
- Two!
- Two!

45:09.708 --> 45:11.833
One. Breathe.

45:19.041 --> 45:20.041
Baby...

45:22.250 --> 45:23.583
Vacho found a job for you.

45:23.583 --> 45:26.083
- It's a full-time job.

45:26.083 --> 45:29.166
Why can't you just talk to him?
For me, please.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.208
And then--
And then I will do this for you.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.583
Yeah, okay.

45:36.250 --> 45:37.208
Okay.

45:38.166 --> 45:41.041
- Hey! You eating the product?
-  Sorry.

45:43.250 --> 45:46.458
Clarence, you gotta believe me.
They got potential.

45:46.458 --> 45:48.666
I just need the product to start sampling.

45:49.208 --> 45:50.541
We got to innovate, remember?

45:51.041 --> 45:53.416
We could cover every Dorito,
Frito and Cheeto with this stuff

45:53.416 --> 45:55.583
and get more orders.
More orders means more shifts.

45:55.583 --> 45:58.416
So, Frito-Lay is gonna make them
because the janitor said so?

45:58.416 --> 45:59.833
Now, Mr. Enrico said that--

45:59.833 --> 46:02.750
Roger Enrico?
We're talking about the guys at the top.

46:02.750 --> 46:06.416
You ain't at the top. I ain't at the top.
Those guys up there are.

46:06.416 --> 46:09.958
Wait, sometimes we just gotta
show 'em what the burrito's worth.

46:09.958 --> 46:11.500
What does that even mean, son?

46:11.500 --> 46:15.000
It may look like it's worthless, but
if people just took a bite, they'd see.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.625
Someone took a chance on you, didn't they?
You got on that machine somehow.

46:18.625 --> 46:21.250
If they took a chance on you again,
you'd run this whole damn place.

46:21.250 --> 46:23.583
- Of course I would.
- Because you believe it.

46:23.583 --> 46:25.166
And I believe in this.

46:25.166 --> 46:28.125
And I know it sounds crazy,
but what else is there to do?

46:28.125 --> 46:29.625
Lose our jobs? Go hungry?

46:34.208 --> 46:35.208
You got a point.

46:38.041 --> 46:40.541
Yo, what are you doing?
Eating all the Cheetos?

46:40.541 --> 46:41.958
So I got a plan, <i>carnal</i>.

46:41.958 --> 46:45.250
All right. So I was talking to Clarence.
This is what we're gonna do.

46:46.500 --> 46:48.958
<i>We had it all to gain and nothin' to lose.</i>

46:48.958 --> 46:53.333
<i>We were just a bunch of brown chips
on a conveyor belt, waitin' to get tossed.</i>

46:57.208 --> 46:59.125
- Thank you, brother. All right.

46:59.125 --> 47:00.833
Almost forgot your Cheetos.

47:00.833 --> 47:01.916
Hey.

47:03.333 --> 47:05.000
That's the Doritos, Fritos, Cheetos.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.083
Hey. Don't get your hopes up too high.
Okay, fool?

47:15.166 --> 47:16.500
You kickin' with these fools again?

47:16.500 --> 47:17.583
Tony, let's go!

47:17.583 --> 47:20.041
You take care of your family.
I take care of mine.

47:23.083 --> 47:25.750
<i>Yeah,
Tony had to go back to that drug life.</i>

47:25.750 --> 47:27.375
<i>'Cause his mom was battling cancer,</i>

47:27.375 --> 47:30.375
<i>and he didn't have any money
to pay for doctor bills.</i>

47:31.291 --> 47:34.041
<i>We were all gonna do whatever it takes
to take care of our families.</i>

47:34.625 --> 47:36.000
It's a full-time job, <i>mijo</i>.

47:36.666 --> 47:38.416
That's good. Full-time's good.

47:39.625 --> 47:42.250
Like Pastor Marco said,
after a year, you'll move on up.

47:42.250 --> 47:43.916
- Ain't that right, Pastor?

47:43.916 --> 47:44.833
 Exactly.

47:44.833 --> 47:46.250
-  Hey, boys, come on.
- Ow.

47:46.250 --> 47:49.125
 And it might pay even more.

47:50.041 --> 47:52.500
In a year, you could be
the head of maintenance.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.166
So, I would go from being a janitor

47:57.958 --> 47:59.125
to being a janitor?

48:00.083 --> 48:02.833
And, hopefully,
<i>si me pongo las pilas</i>, and I'm lucky,

48:02.833 --> 48:05.583
I'm gonna maybe be janitor-in-chief?
President of the janitors?

48:05.583 --> 48:08.208
King of the janitors?

48:08.875 --> 48:10.750
Nah, I'm good.

48:11.750 --> 48:15.000
I think I'll stick with Frito-Lay,
where I have a real future.

48:16.791 --> 48:20.083
Better the devil you know
than the devil you don't, eh, Vacho?

48:21.250 --> 48:24.333
Don't be stupid, <i>mijo</i>. They don't believe
in you or care about you.

48:24.333 --> 48:25.416
And you do?

48:26.333 --> 48:28.583
All that ever comes out of your mouth
is what an idiot I am.

48:28.583 --> 48:30.958
That I ain't worth shit.
I can't do nothin' right.

48:30.958 --> 48:33.208
You expect me to trust you
when you say God believes in me?

48:33.208 --> 48:34.625
He does.

48:35.333 --> 48:36.708
According to the Book of Vacho.

48:37.041 --> 48:38.250
 Don't talk to me like that.

48:38.750 --> 48:40.458
You respect me in front of my company--

48:40.458 --> 48:41.541
Respect you?

48:46.166 --> 48:47.500
Hey, check it out, Pastor.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.333
I bet you didn't know that
he beat the shit out of me my whole life.

48:52.291 --> 48:56.583
But it doesn't bother me.
Because I got thick skin and a hard skull.

48:57.333 --> 48:58.833
You know what really sucks, <i>Apá</i>?

48:59.333 --> 49:04.750
Is that I hear your voice in my head,
beating my brain every day.

49:06.166 --> 49:10.375
And for some reason,
that's the beating I can't get up from.

49:12.583 --> 49:14.083
- I'm just trying to help.
- Back off.

49:14.083 --> 49:15.041
Hey, baby.

49:15.041 --> 49:17.875
It's getting so bad, your wife is looking
for help behind your back.

49:17.875 --> 49:20.291
- She's lost all faith in you.
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

49:20.291 --> 49:23.041
You do not speak for me, Vacho,
and you sure as hell don't speak for God.

49:24.083 --> 49:27.083
Richard, look at me. I did not say
that I didn't have faith in you.

49:28.041 --> 49:30.375
I know what Richard is,
and I know what he isn't.

49:30.375 --> 49:33.875
Not educated? Sure.
But he is the smartest person that I know.

49:34.916 --> 49:36.750
He already knows God.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.875
You wanna save someone? Save yourself.

49:40.791 --> 49:43.833
And then you come to him
when you're the father that he needs.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.208
Come on, baby.
We're gonna go put my voice in your head.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.958
Come on, kids. We're leaving. Let's go.

49:50.958 --> 49:52.291
I don't want to go.

49:52.291 --> 49:53.625
Come on. Just go.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.583
Let's go, guys. Get in the car.

50:06.416 --> 50:10.125
Hey. If we're gonna make those <i>güeritos</i>
sweat, we're gonna get the good stuff.

50:12.541 --> 50:15.416
<i>To be the best,
you had to get the best. Homegrown, baby.</i>

50:15.416 --> 50:16.500
MEXICO LINDO

50:16.500 --> 50:20.708
<i>Chile molido, chile fresco,
chile guajillo, chile piquín,</i>

50:20.708 --> 50:22.916
<i>I mean, you name it,
we cleared the shelves of it.</i>

50:22.916 --> 50:24.000
Baby, get the red chile.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.125
- I can't, Mom.
- Yes, you can, <i>Papá</i>. Come on.

50:30.291 --> 50:32.125
Jude, which chiles do you want?

50:32.125 --> 50:33.583
All of 'em, babe.

50:33.583 --> 50:35.875
<i>No chile was left unturned.</i>

50:36.625 --> 50:38.875
Jude! Jalapeños or serranos?

50:39.750 --> 50:42.375
Hey, babe! I found some <i>güeritos</i>.

50:42.375 --> 50:46.000
Okay, baby. Which one you wanna try?
The Cheetos? Fritos? Doritos? The popcorn?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.125
<i>And I had my very own focus group.</i>

50:48.125 --> 50:49.750
- Uh, Doritos.
- Oh, yeah.

50:54.416 --> 50:56.458
Hot!

50:56.458 --> 50:58.583
Hot like <i>elote</i> hot? Good hot?

50:58.583 --> 51:00.708
- No! Bad, bad, bad.
- Come on.

51:04.041 --> 51:05.125
- Oh, my-- Baby.
- Hot.

51:05.125 --> 51:06.041
Oh, water!

51:06.041 --> 51:09.125
Chale<i>, man.
That salsa would've made the devil sweat.</i>

51:09.625 --> 51:11.083
<i>While we were trying to remember</i>

51:11.083 --> 51:15.500
<i>everything our</i> abuelitas <i>taught us
about chile, apparently, in the Midwest,</i>

51:15.500 --> 51:18.083
<i>they had already been spicing things up
for a while.</i>

51:18.083 --> 51:21.708
<i>Except their ingredients came
in test tubes and syringes.</i>

51:21.708 --> 51:22.833
Oh, it's hot.

51:22.833 --> 51:25.000
- Hot. Hot. Hot!

51:25.000 --> 51:27.250
<i>I don't know what's going down over there.</i>

51:27.250 --> 51:31.416
<i>All I knew was, our ingredients came
from the ground. Our roots.</i>

51:32.375 --> 51:33.625
Maltodextrin.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.500
Monosodium glutamate.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.916
Disodium inosinate.

51:41.916 --> 51:45.000
<i>Me and Judy had
that spice in our DNA.</i>

51:45.000 --> 51:46.375
You gotta turn the bowl.

51:46.375 --> 51:47.708
- Look, taste this.

51:47.708 --> 51:49.125
There you go. How is it?

51:49.916 --> 51:50.916
- It's wet.
- Wet?

51:50.916 --> 51:53.333
I think we need to bake 'em.
I think they need to be dry ingredients.

51:53.333 --> 51:54.750
Wait, no, no, no. Try it.

51:54.750 --> 51:57.000
- Ah, <i>chile de pasilla</i>.
-  Mmm.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.125
Dad, just shake it. It's not sticking.

51:59.625 --> 52:02.125
It's gotta tumble,
like it does in the factory.

52:07.666 --> 52:12.125
<i>If anyone was gonna crack this recipe,
it was gonna be us: the Montañez.</i>

52:14.083 --> 52:16.875
<i>We had tried every chile
in every store in town.</i>

52:19.250 --> 52:20.250
<i>Until finally...</i>

52:31.041 --> 52:32.708
Ow! Ow! Ow! It burns!

52:32.708 --> 52:34.291
Burns good or burns bad?

52:35.750 --> 52:37.416
It burns good.

52:37.416 --> 52:38.750
- Oh!

52:38.750 --> 52:39.833
Oh, we did it!

52:39.833 --> 52:41.166
- Oh. Yeah!

52:41.166 --> 52:42.500
Of course we did!

52:48.333 --> 52:51.083
I'm just doing
what corporate tells me to do.

52:51.583 --> 52:52.583
What happened?

52:53.250 --> 52:56.250
- Layoffs, son. Lots of 'em.
-  I'm the messenger here.

52:58.333 --> 53:00.000
Where's Tony? Where's Nacho?

53:01.791 --> 53:04.125
Do you really think
I wanna lay people off?

53:04.125 --> 53:07.583
Okay. Hey, hey, hey! That's it!
That's all I got for now, okay?

53:07.583 --> 53:08.875
Back to work.

53:08.875 --> 53:11.041
- Hey, Lonny!
-  Somebody put this ladder back.

53:11.041 --> 53:13.500
Lonny, hold up, man.
Hey, look. You gotta listen to me.

53:13.500 --> 53:16.416
I got an idea.
An idea you gotta tell Enrico about.

53:17.041 --> 53:19.500
It's a new line of products.
It's a spicy chip!

53:19.500 --> 53:22.958
It's gonna change everything.
Spicy Doritos, Fritos, Cheetos.

53:22.958 --> 53:24.041
Spicy what?

53:24.041 --> 53:26.708
I just laid off
a slew of hardworking guys again.

53:26.708 --> 53:28.083
- Yeah--
- A lot of 'em your friends,

53:28.083 --> 53:30.000
and you wanna tell me
about some new flavor you got?

53:30.000 --> 53:31.333
Look, if you just called Enrico...

53:31.333 --> 53:33.166
Oh, you just want me to call Enrico?

53:33.166 --> 53:35.083
- Yeah.
- And just tell him,

53:35.083 --> 53:39.208
"Oh, our janitor, the guy who cleans
the toilets, he's got a bright idea"?

53:39.208 --> 53:41.416
You know I can do more
than clean the toilets, Lonny.

53:41.416 --> 53:43.000
It ain't like that, okay?

53:43.000 --> 53:46.791
New products take years to develop,
cost millions to launch,

53:46.791 --> 53:50.083
and they do not get created
by blue-collar hoodlums,

53:50.083 --> 53:53.083
who probably can't spell
the word "hoodlum."

53:54.583 --> 53:56.541
Hey! What's with the chitchat?

54:03.500 --> 54:04.583
<i>When I was seven,</i>

54:05.666 --> 54:09.000
<i>these white ladies would come
to our school to tutor us in reading.</i>

54:09.791 --> 54:12.291
<i>Except there were two trailers.
One for the white kids...</i>

54:12.291 --> 54:13.583
LONNY MASON
PLANT SUPERVISOR

54:13.583 --> 54:16.416
<i>...and one for everybody else,
the brown kids.</i>

54:17.041 --> 54:20.083
<i>Because, you know,
they liked to keep us separate.</i>

54:21.750 --> 54:23.625
<i>And then,
kids that came out of the white trailer,</i>

54:23.625 --> 54:26.041
<i>they always came out
with cookies in their hands.</i>

54:27.791 --> 54:29.375
<i>And I really wanted one of those cookies.</i>

54:29.375 --> 54:30.541
COMPANY TELEPHONE DIRECTORY

54:32.625 --> 54:34.916
<i>And one day, I got in that line.</i>

54:38.250 --> 54:39.791
<i>The white kids spit at me, shoved me...</i>

54:39.791 --> 54:41.541
FRITO-LAY CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
EXECUTIVE OFFICES

54:41.541 --> 54:43.166
<i>... and told me, "Go back to Mexico!"</i>

54:43.166 --> 54:44.625
ROGER ENRICO
Chief Executive Officer

54:45.458 --> 54:47.958
<i>But I didn't care. I stayed in that line.</i>

54:49.000 --> 54:50.875
<i>I went into that trailer.</i>

54:54.666 --> 54:58.833
<i>And when I came out,
I came out with my damn cookies.</i>

55:21.625 --> 55:24.333
Patti
Secretary to Roger Enrico

55:25.916 --> 55:27.625
Office of President Roger Enrico.

55:27.625 --> 55:29.333
Uh, hi.

55:29.333 --> 55:32.458
Uh, may I speak with Roger Enrico, please?
This is Richard Montañez.

55:32.458 --> 55:35.125
Uh, what country are you calling from,
Mr. Montañez?

55:35.708 --> 55:36.875
United States.

55:37.875 --> 55:42.166
Well, you're not
the president of American corporate,

55:42.166 --> 55:43.375
'cause that's not his name.

55:43.375 --> 55:44.833
I work in California.

55:44.833 --> 55:46.875
Don't say anything. This says "received."

55:46.875 --> 55:48.833
Oh, you're the VP of California.

55:48.833 --> 55:49.916
<i>No, I, um...</i>

55:49.916 --> 55:52.458
- You. Let's go.
- I work at the Rancho Cucamonga plant.

55:52.458 --> 55:54.541
Okay, so you're the plant director?

55:54.541 --> 55:57.750
Not exactly.
I work "inside" inside the plant.

55:57.750 --> 55:58.833
I'm, uh...

56:01.041 --> 56:02.458
I'm a maintenance technician.

56:05.541 --> 56:06.666
Hello?

56:06.666 --> 56:09.375
Um, the janitor? You're the janitor?

56:09.375 --> 56:11.000
Okay, no, no, don't-don't-don't hang up.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.083
I have an idea that's gonna
revolutionize Frito-Lay.

56:13.083 --> 56:15.041
That'll save our factory,
that'll save jobs,

56:15.041 --> 56:17.583
that'll save hardworking people
who are just trying to survive.

56:18.083 --> 56:21.333
Look, if he cares about his people,
his people on the line,

56:21.333 --> 56:22.916
Mr. Enrico needs to hear this.

56:33.625 --> 56:34.625
Please hold.

56:42.875 --> 56:44.541
Hello, Richard. This is Roger.

56:44.541 --> 56:46.541
Mr. Enrico, uh--

56:48.708 --> 56:50.291
Thank you for taking my call.

56:50.291 --> 56:52.041
I have an idea that you need to hear.

56:52.875 --> 56:54.041
I'm listening.

56:54.041 --> 56:55.791
<i>Okay, yes, sir.</i>

56:55.791 --> 56:59.833
I'm Mexican and proud of it.
And there's a lot of us in this country,

56:59.833 --> 57:02.583
and we spend money on snacks
just like everybody else.

57:03.125 --> 57:06.625
We eat Doritos, but not before
covering them suckers with Tapatio.

57:06.625 --> 57:09.625
<i>It's like the more it burns,
the more money we'll spend on it.</i>

57:09.625 --> 57:12.333
So I thought,
"Why don't I make my own spicy slurry?"

57:12.333 --> 57:15.791
You made your own spicy slurry?

57:15.791 --> 57:17.333
<i>Yeah, I did. And it's good.</i>

57:17.333 --> 57:21.708
You can slather it on everything:
Doritos, Fritos, popcorn, Cheetos.

57:21.708 --> 57:24.875
And the best part, sir,
it is 100% Mexican-approved.

57:24.875 --> 57:28.000
Uh, my family, my neighbors,
they can't get enough.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
<i>And I got a plan, Mr. Enrico, to get it
to the streets, to get it to my people.</i>

57:32.000 --> 57:36.291
I think it will save our factory.
It will save jobs.

57:36.875 --> 57:38.000
Save jobs, huh?

57:39.750 --> 57:42.541
That's a lot of confidence there, Richard.

57:42.541 --> 57:49.166
Yes, sir. And you said in the video,
"Think like a CEO." So I did.

57:53.750 --> 57:55.250
You saw my video?

57:55.250 --> 57:56.333
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

57:56.333 --> 57:58.416
And you're a janitor?

57:58.416 --> 57:59.875
Maintenance crew, sir.

57:59.875 --> 58:02.875
Look, if it's okay,
I'd like to send you some samples, sir.

58:04.291 --> 58:07.541
Richard, that's more than okay with me.

58:07.541 --> 58:09.000
-<i>More than okay.</i>

58:09.875 --> 58:10.875
Thank you, sir.

What are we doing, guys?
First class? Priority?

58:24.708 --> 58:25.708
Hold on a sec.

58:31.166 --> 58:32.166
We should pray.

58:33.125 --> 58:34.875
- We should?
- Yeah.

58:34.875 --> 58:38.791
I mean, God got us here, right?
We should let God take it home.

58:39.833 --> 58:40.875
Yeah. Yeah.

58:44.625 --> 58:47.791
Uh, dear God, Jesus, señor...

58:48.875 --> 58:50.416
- I mean, you know who you are.

58:50.416 --> 58:55.375
Listen, man. We both know I've--
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.

58:55.375 --> 58:59.958
Mmm, the gang, the guns, the drugs,
the stolen cars, the other drugs.

59:00.458 --> 59:01.708
Man, there was a lot of drugs.

59:01.708 --> 59:06.083
You know,
maybe I wasn't never bad, just lost.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.541
But I'm doing good things now, so--

59:08.541 --> 59:10.500
What the heck, man? Let's move it.

59:10.500 --> 59:13.375
Hey! He is praying, <i>pendejo</i>!
Have some respect.

59:15.166 --> 59:16.291
Go ahead, baby.

59:16.958 --> 59:21.166
Lord, please forgive me
for all my past sins, and...

59:23.416 --> 59:25.458
pour all your blessings
onto this box right here.

59:27.875 --> 59:28.875
A-Amen?

59:28.875 --> 59:30.375
Amen.

59:32.625 --> 59:33.916
Amen.

59:35.791 --> 59:36.791
Amen.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.375
-<i>Are you there?</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:39.583
Listen, Richard, I can't stop thinking
about your initiative.

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:42.875
<i>And I'm coming to Rancho Cucamonga
for a plant tour.</i>

01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:45.000
What do you say I meet you there,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.333
and you tell me more about your ideas.

01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:50.000
<i>In about two weeks.</i>

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.458
-<i>Would that be okay with you?</i>
- Yes, sir. More than okay.

01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:54.416
Good. We'll be in touch.

01:00:56.916 --> 01:01:00.625
Who the hell is this Richard Montañez?

01:01:00.625 --> 01:01:03.333
And who let him call
Roger-freaking-Enrico?

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:04.666
Get him on the phone!

01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:06.250
Okay, I don't know who that is!

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.083
What do you mean you don't know the guy?

01:01:08.083 --> 01:01:10.291
He works in your plant. Find him!

01:01:11.541 --> 01:01:12.833
Montañez?

01:01:13.416 --> 01:01:14.958
Montañez!

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:17.875
- Stay right there!

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.291
-  <i>Turns out, I messed up.</i>
-  Are you kidding me?

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:22.916
<i>I broke rank and went straight to the top.</i>

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:25.833
<i>Wasn't nobody happy with this</i> chavalo
<i>talking to the top dog.</i>

01:01:25.833 --> 01:01:28.375
- Lonny, it ain't even like that.
- Oh, you're gonna paint.

01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.333
You're gonna fix every machine in here.

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:32.000
You're gonna clean every particle of dust

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.583
until every code violation
in here is gone.

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:35.666
Good luck with that!

01:01:35.666 --> 01:01:37.416
Mr. Enrico's coming to hear
about my product.

01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:40.833
Yeah, and when he's done listening
and realizes it's all nonsense,

01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:43.166
he's gonna think, "Hey, I don't need you."

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.750
Then he's gonna realize we need
to stop hemorrhaging money,

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:48.500
and he's gonna start by shutting us down!

01:01:49.833 --> 01:01:52.083
You better pray for a miracle, Montañez.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:56.375
Because before this is over,
one way or another, you won't have a job.

01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:57.625
- No!

01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:00.666
None of us will have a job!
Thanks to Richard!

01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:02.583
Thanks, Richard.

01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:11.916
Mm-mmm.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:25.041
Baby?

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.500
What are you doing up?

01:02:28.541 --> 01:02:31.041
I got to find a way to stop Enrico
from coming.

01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:33.083
- Stop him?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:35.750
Uh-uh. No, what--

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.458
- What are you doing?

01:02:37.458 --> 01:02:39.875
Uh-uh. Come on. Get up. Get up. Come on!

01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:42.750
Look at yourself.

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.916
- Look. You see that guy right there?

01:02:44.916 --> 01:02:46.750
Who? That <i>guapo</i> right there?
Yeah, I see him.

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.458
Yeah, you do? You see a good man?

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:49.833
- Come on.
- A special man?

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.000
Because, baby, that's what I see.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:54.083
I see a <i>chingón</i>.

01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:55.666
A Montañez.

01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:00.958
<i>They're scared.</i>

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:03.125
Scared of what you can do for them.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.916
Scared that they've been begging for help,

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:09.250
and they got a broke Mexican kid
from Guasti as their hero.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.541
They don't know what to do with that.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.791
Baby, do you know what I've
been praying for all these years?

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:21.333
That you would see the gifts
and talents that you have.

01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:23.875
Baby, use your gifts.

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:25.541
Be great!

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:29.583
Enrico is coming to hear you speak.

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:33.083
Do not let these <i>sinvergüenzas</i> stop you.

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:35.791
I--

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:39.541
I-I don't even know
how to do a sales presentation.

01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:41.916
Well, guess what?

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:43.500
We're gonna find out.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.916
Now, come on. Let's go to bed.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.500
<i>You wanna survive this crazy world?</i>

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.708
<i>Get yourself a Judy.</i>

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.291
<i>Man, she took me to biz church
the next few weeks.</i>

01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:55.875
- Okay, that's enough.
- That's really smart.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.750
- Babe, no.
- Ooh, baby, <i>The Hispanic Market</i>.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:58.958
- That's good.
-  Great book.

01:03:58.958 --> 01:04:01.750
This is great. I had no idea
any of this stuff was a-- a thing.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.416
You don't know how
to use a computer, right?

01:04:03.416 --> 01:04:05.416
- So this is all the information online...
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:05.416 --> 01:04:07.000
I should learn how to use a computer.

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:10.125
"Present a solution to their challenges."

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.166
Connect prospects to profits.

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.125
What's "prospects"?

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:15.458
Got it!

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:17.416
No, baby,
you have to be, like, animated.

01:04:17.416 --> 01:04:18.500
What, like Bugs Bunny?

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.166
- No, like, excited, big, you know?

01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:25.125
"The Hispanics are the fastest growing
segment in the US population."

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:28.000
See, that's what I've been saying, baby.
We like to get down!

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.750
Okay, baby. Come on. Reel it in.

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:32.000
I need to say something like,
"We're being ignored."

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.666
Then say that, but from your diaphragm
and your chest, head up.

01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:37.000
Take control of the room.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.250
Say, "The Hispanic market
will not be ignored."

01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:45.416
The Hispanic market will not be ignored.

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:47.083
Good, but in your voice.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:00.708
- Baby, I found Versace for $3.
- Yeah?

01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:04.708
Oh, no, it's Vermace

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.000
-  You look so good.
-  Yeah?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.416
- I feel weird.
- No, you look good.

01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:14.500
You look sharp.

01:05:15.291 --> 01:05:17.083
This looks really good on you.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.458
Something like this.

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:22.958
You're the best person I know.

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:26.416
Who, me?

01:05:26.416 --> 01:05:28.750
I'm just a poor <i>cholita</i>
who got smart about God.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:32.041
Nah, pretty sure God got smart about you.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.291
Jude, I--

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:41.750
I'm here because of you.

01:05:42.791 --> 01:05:43.875
You know that, right?

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:46.708
What?

01:05:47.666 --> 01:05:48.833
There's no me without you.

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:55.000
Thank you for believing in me, <i>mi reina</i>.

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:03.375
Well, your <i>reina</i>
don't know jack about tying a tie.

01:06:06.291 --> 01:06:08.250
B-But I know someone who does.

01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:13.208
-  Nah, man. He already--
- Baby, I know.

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:14.500
I know, I know.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.791
But he won't stop calling.
I don't think he's gonna go away.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.041
He does love you.

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:26.833
You look good.

01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:29.791
I'm gonna go find some fake Gucci.

01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:36.208
<i>When you've had as many
court dates as Vacho,</i>

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:37.583
<i>you master tying a tie.</i>

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:44.625
- I know I don't got the right to tell you.
- Come on, man.

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.750
-  Listen to me.

01:06:54.583 --> 01:06:56.708
I am so proud of you, <i>mijo</i>.

01:06:58.166 --> 01:07:03.666
And I'll always regret not being the man
that made you the man you are today.

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:07.333
Always.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:15.750
 Now,

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:17.375
go get 'em.

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:22.625
You look good, <i>mijo</i>.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:02.041
1991 HISPANIC POPULATION

01:08:02.041 --> 01:08:04.833
There are more Hispanics
in the United States than there are...

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:08.416
There are more Hispanics
in the United States

01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:10.291
than there are in--

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:11.583
Come on out. It's time.

01:08:12.916 --> 01:08:13.916
Okay.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.750
And I've organized a checklist
that we call "quality control" or "QC."

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:22.375
You can say "Quality C" too.
Actually, either way.

01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:25.333
And those quality checks
every 20 minutes are the reason

01:08:25.333 --> 01:08:27.333
we haven't had a line go down in years.

01:08:27.333 --> 01:08:28.500
Unlike Bakersfield.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.291
- Right, I see.
- If you don't mind,

01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:32.291
I'd love to show you
how the collets are made.

01:08:32.291 --> 01:08:35.416
Mr. Mason, I happen to know
how collets are made.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:37.125
My time is limited, so I--

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:39.000
Where is Richard?
I'd like to speak to him.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.708
Sure, sure. Uh, Richard!

01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:41.791
I'm here!

01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:02.375
The infamous Richard Montañez.

01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:04.375
What an honor to meet you, Richard.

01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:05.625
Are you ready?

01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:07.916
<i>A huevo.</i> I've been ready.

01:09:07.916 --> 01:09:09.125
All right.

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:12.375
<i>All right, all right.
Judy says I exaggerate this part a lot.</i>

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.416
<i>I guess it was
a little bit more like this.</i>

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.375
I'm here! Here!

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:18.500
- Pardon me.
-  Watch out.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.333
-  That's my foot!
- Sorry. Excuse me.

01:09:20.333 --> 01:09:22.458
Just need to get right there.
Thank you so much.

01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:30.916
So nice to meet you.

01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:34.250
Are you ready, Richard?

01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:36.333
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.000
Anytime you're ready, Richard.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:58.166
"The growing number of Latinos in America

01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:01.916
represents a vast untapped market
for Frito-Lay."

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000
"Did you know that there are more Latinos
in the United States than in Australia?"

01:10:10.583 --> 01:10:11.583
Of course there are.

01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:15.583
No, um.

01:10:15.583 --> 01:10:17.333
Nah, that's not-- I meant that, um--

01:10:17.333 --> 01:10:19.833
Did you know that there are more Latinos
in the United States

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:21.833
than there are Australians in Australia?

01:10:26.125 --> 01:10:28.791
Pretty sure there's more Mexicans
in this room than in Australia.

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.791
Clarence, can you get the light, please?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.583
Listen, gentlemen, no offense...

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:50.916
but our shelves are boring.

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:55.708
People, my people,
they're tired of the same old flavors.

01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:58.500
See, I grew up with a lot of flavors,

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.958
and I've been searching for that taste
in everything I buy ever since.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.083
I want a food that tastes like home.

01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:09.416
This is it.

01:11:09.916 --> 01:11:11.958
Everything I grew up with, in a bag.

01:11:12.458 --> 01:11:13.500
<i>Chile</i> chips.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.625
And if you put this out there,
you'll see that there's this whole market

01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:19.291
that no one else is paying attention to.

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:22.000
Us, <i>la gente</i>.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.583
And what about market share?
How much would your, uh, "product" yield?

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:29.083
- According to you.
- Um...

01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:31.166
<i>What the F is market share?</i>

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:32.541
<i>That wasn't in the books.</i>

01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:34.625
<i>Or maybe it was. It was a lot of books.</i>

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:35.708
Um...

01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:48.208
This much.

01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:50.250
This much market share.

01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:58.333
You know what?

01:11:58.333 --> 01:11:59.916
I don't know what market share is

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:02.958
because I don't sit up
in no corporate office wearing a suit.

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:06.000
Like, I'm down here with <i>mi gente</i>,

01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:08.125
and here's what I know about 'em.

01:12:08.125 --> 01:12:10.500
They're looking for themselves
on those shelves.

01:12:11.416 --> 01:12:14.625
They wanna know that the food
that they eat at home is valued by you.

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:16.208
That we matter.

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:19.458
I wanna know that I matter
when I pick up one of our products.

01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:23.375
To you, to this company, to the world.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.958
So put this chili slurry on Doritos,
Fritos, popcorn, anything.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:31.875
Because, at the end of the day,
it's how we make them feel.

01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:34.958
If we knew that there was
a product out there for us,

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:37.250
we'd say, "Take all our money, <i>cabrónes</i>."

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:47.791
Oof, I got a little hood there
at the end, but...

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.083
Gentlemen...

01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:56.750
...did you know we could get
this much more market share?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.666
- Did you?

01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:02.041
Thank you, Richard.

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:06.166
You have given us
a lot to think about here.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.166
Uh, sir, I got--

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:10.708
I got some more graphs and stuff
that I can show you.

01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:16.333
Sir, R & D already has
a spicy product in the Midwest,

01:13:16.333 --> 01:13:18.041
and it's testing just fine.

01:13:18.041 --> 01:13:22.041
Just fine? I aim to do better
than "just fine," James.

01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:25.000
Have McCormick send
the spicy seasonings here.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.083
I have a good feeling about this man.

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:29.041
He may not know about market trends,

01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:33.083
but he knows about people,
and that's where I always put my money.

01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:34.458
Let's see what he can do with it.

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:36.875
Sir, the resources required for it
to pivot so quickly--

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:38.708
James,
looks like you have some work to do.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:40.625
Do we wanna finish the tour?

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.208
-  He's here, baby! Go!

01:13:42.208 --> 01:13:44.250
-  Dad!
-  Hey!

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.666
-  How was it?
-  Great.

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:48.416
-  Did you tell them about me?
-  Of course I told them.

01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:50.416
<i>Enrico wanted to test the market
with 5,000 cases.</i>

01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:52.166
McCORMICK

01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:55.500
<i>The next few months were a blur.</i>

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.083
<i>I did it, man. I got my shot.</i>

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:02.666
Well, it's not Judy's, but it will do.

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:07.500
First one off the line.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.458
Cheetos
FLAMIN' HOT

01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:14.291
You did good.

01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:18.916
<i>I was the guy with initiative,
and this was my magnum opus.</i>

01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:21.250
<i>Judy taught me that phrase.</i>

01:14:27.208 --> 01:14:28.166
Ruffles
Potato Chips

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:30.208

FRITO LAY HQ
JAMES FINLEY

01:14:37.666 --> 01:14:40.916
<i>As I suspected, the product
isn't selling, so we're pulling it.</i>

01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:42.708
They haven't been
on the market long enough.

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:45.166
Mr. Montañez, product's not moving.

01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:46.375
Simple as that.

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.208
Mr. Finley, I was just wondering,
how many cases have we moved so far?

01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:52.375
<i>I don't have that information
in front of me.</i>

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:55.833
But we can't continue to invest
in Richard's strategies at this rate.

01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:57.458
What strategies?

01:14:57.458 --> 01:14:59.375
You haven't even let me do anything!

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:01.833
Like, are you even targeting
all the Latino cities?

01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:04.000
<i>We're everywhere! Pacoima. Montebello.</i>

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.041
Of course, Mr. Montañez.

01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:08.916
And no one in your market
is responding to it.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:12.250
Uh, sir, Mr. Finley, could--
could we just get one more week?

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.125
I mean, that-that-that's all we're asking.

01:15:16.375 --> 01:15:18.375
Hey! What is it? What happened?

01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:20.500
They're not moving the product.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.666
They're killing it.
They're gonna shut us down.

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:25.666
Like, who'd I think I was?

01:15:26.541 --> 01:15:27.916
I'm a nobody.

01:15:27.916 --> 01:15:30.333
Pretending like
I could do something was stupid.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:31.416
Oh, wait a minute.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.625
You find out
that the product's not moving,

01:15:34.625 --> 01:15:37.041
so you decide that you're an idiot
and can't do nothin'?

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.875
Figure out the next step.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:41.666
Yeah, what next step?

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:43.625
There's no next step for guys like us.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:46.333
If there was a next step, you would've had
Lonny's job a long time ago.

01:15:47.625 --> 01:15:48.791
All right, all right.

01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:49.875
You ain't wrong.

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.958
But did I let that stop me
from being the best damn worker here?

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:56.041
Did this place stop you

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:59.416
from having the balls to pick up the phone
and call Roger Enrico?

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:01.666
Yeah, but then I embarrassed myself.

01:16:01.666 --> 01:16:03.875
Embarrassment's never stopped you before.

01:16:04.541 --> 01:16:07.625
Ask questions.
You wore my ass out with 'em.

01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:12.833
Look here, the person
I met ten years ago wouldn't blink.

01:16:12.833 --> 01:16:14.875
He'd find a way, any way, to get it done.

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:17.625
I don't wanna look you up
in 20 years from now

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:19.916
just to find out you're still down here
on the bottom.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Step up!

01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:30.625
Baby, can't you just call Enrico?

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.916
Calling Enrico is what got me
in this mess in the first place.

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:37.791
Clarence is right.

01:16:39.208 --> 01:16:40.416
I gotta figure this out.

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:53.750
-  <i>Apá.</i>
-  What's wrong, baby?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.083
He got scared.

01:16:55.666 --> 01:16:57.791
Oh, you don't need to be scared.

01:16:57.791 --> 01:16:59.416
The power just went out.

01:16:59.416 --> 01:17:01.666
Plus, your dad's gonna take care
of everything.

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:03.625
I think I know why it's not selling.

01:17:03.625 --> 01:17:05.458
- What do you mean?
-  The Cheetos.

01:17:06.166 --> 01:17:07.666
They didn't tell anyone it exists.

01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:11.000
There's no commercials,
but there's commercials for everything.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.541
Cookie Crisp, Sega,
but none for Hot Cheetos.

01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:15.875
I didn't see none.

01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:17.416
Hmm.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.166
Wait.

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:30.833
Let's buy a commercial.

01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:34.833
I know it's not a lot, but it's a start.

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:38.666
<i>This little</i> mocoso
<i>was giving me his lunch money,</i>

01:17:38.666 --> 01:17:41.000
<i>his recycling money, everything.</i>

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.541
<i>And I wasn't gonna take it.</i>

01:17:43.541 --> 01:17:44.791
All right.

01:17:44.791 --> 01:17:46.625
<i>But I was gonna take his idea.</i>

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
Hey! I'm gonna get your job back, big dog!

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.083
But I need your help.

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:53.000
Little busy here, bro.

01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:56.875
This way, Mrs. Romero.

01:17:56.875 --> 01:18:00.083
I got an idea, but I need you guys
to do what you do best.

01:18:00.083 --> 01:18:02.000
Oh, yeah? What's that?

01:18:03.541 --> 01:18:05.208
A little guerrilla marketing.

01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:08.041
<i>Man, these fools didn't have
no business degrees,</i>

01:18:08.041 --> 01:18:10.000
<i>but they could sell condoms to a nun.</i>

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.666
<i>They could close a hundred sales in a day.
They move product like G's.</i>

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:33.625
Hey, stick around!

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.791
Everybody, come here!
Come close! Bring it in!

01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:36.958
Come on in!

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.500
-<i>Oigan!</i> Listen up!
- Hector! Alejandro!

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:41.875
-  Gino!

01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:43.583
Come on, everybody.

01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:45.250
- I like your hairnet. <i>Firme.</i>
-  Come on!

01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:48.333
I got something to say!
Everybody needs to hear this!

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:49.708
Montañez.

01:18:49.708 --> 01:18:52.583
That is not safe or sanitary.
Get down from there right now.

01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.250
Back up. Not today. Okay, Lonny?

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.500
Not today.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.166
Yeah, I was backing up.

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:01.791
Corporate's killing the product.

01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:03.250
- What?
- Aw, man.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:04.541
No. I know! I know!

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.291
But it's not because
the people don't love it.

01:19:07.291 --> 01:19:10.500
If people knew it existed,
it would be huge.

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:13.208
Like, yeah, we can let it die.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:15.208
We can let the factory get shut down...

01:19:16.416 --> 01:19:19.166
...or we can pick ourselves up
and show 'em who we are.

01:19:19.916 --> 01:19:21.833
I ain't got no fancy degrees.

01:19:21.833 --> 01:19:23.041
None of us do.

01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:24.166
We don't need 'em,

01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:25.666
because people like us,

01:19:26.416 --> 01:19:27.791
like you and me,

01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:30.375
we're what makes this whole thing run.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:34.000
None of this exists if we don't exist.

01:19:35.416 --> 01:19:37.250
Let's show 'em that we won't be buried.

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:39.583
Shut up, Montañez!
You trying to get us all fired?

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:42.333
Hey! Let the man speak.

01:19:43.083 --> 01:19:44.083
Go on, brother.

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:46.000
I'm not trying to get you fired.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.916
I'm asking you to save your job.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.291
Because if we don't,
that's it for all of us.

01:19:52.375 --> 01:19:55.083
And this product doesn't only have
the Montañez name on it.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.375
It's got the Romero name.

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:59.916
- Morales.
- Hey.

01:19:59.916 --> 01:20:01.541
Baker.

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:04.291
- Listen.
- And Carson.

01:20:06.708 --> 01:20:09.291
Enrico believes that we're
what make this company special.

01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.916
So we can sit around
like a bunch of <i>huevónes</i>...

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:17.166
or we can stand up and be great.

01:20:17.958 --> 01:20:20.666
What exactly are
you asking for here, Montañez?

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.750
I need all the product that didn't sell
loaded up into the trucks.

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:25.000
Everyone who's got the time,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.333
before or after your shifts,
whatever it takes.

01:20:27.333 --> 01:20:30.291
We're gonna distribute it.
We're gonna get it out to our people.

01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:40.708
Well, you heard the man!

01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:44.500
Get up, line up, and let's get
this product on those trucks. Let's go!

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.333
-  <i>Ándele!</i>

01:20:48.375 --> 01:20:50.291
-  Let's load up!
-  Let's move.

01:20:50.291 --> 01:20:52.625
Hey, Hector, get the truck! Let's go!

01:20:58.708 --> 01:20:59.541
Take that.

01:21:06.208 --> 01:21:07.291
Grab a box!

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:09.791
Everybody, come on in!
We're gonna load up all the cars!

01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:11.250
Move down the line.

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:12.916
Here we go! Here we go!

01:21:12.916 --> 01:21:15.000
Drop the box, go get another one.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.208
- Pack them in there tight, guys.
-  Here you go.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:19.916
Drop a box.

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.750
- Get back in and get another one.
-  More boxes on this side!

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:23.833
Can I?

01:21:26.291 --> 01:21:27.416
Wow.

01:21:31.041 --> 01:21:33.541
-  Thank you, hon.

01:21:33.541 --> 01:21:34.666
What's up?

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.041
- Hi, mama.
- Hey, can I have one?

01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:42.625
Here's another one.
Tell all your family too.

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:44.625
Cheetos! Get 'em.
Get your Cheetos!

01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:47.875
- Hey, my son made those.
- You must be proud, eh?

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.541
Yeah, tell your friends.

01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:52.000
- You're gonna love them.
-  Get your Flamin' Hot Cheetos!

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.916
Hey! Flamin' Hot Cheetos!

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:58.833
Big sister.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:00.625
The convenience store.

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.500
- Enjoy.
- Bro, check it out!

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.458
They're different because they're spicy.

01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:08.541
 Hot Cheetos!

01:22:09.083 --> 01:22:11.791
Guys, guys!
Come here! Come here! Hot Cheetos.

01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:14.500
- Guys, guys. Hey, wait up. Hot Cheetos.
- Hot Cheetos. Come here.

01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:18.083
- Here, here! Take 'em.
- Hey, thank you, little man.

01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:19.000
Thanks.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.041
-  Hey, guys. Try these.
-  Excuse me.

01:22:21.041 --> 01:22:22.291
So good. Try these.

01:22:22.291 --> 01:22:25.375
Hey. We just made these. They're Cheetos
with <i>chile</i> on them. You gotta try 'em.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.750
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, they're crazy.

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.875
- Your kids are gonna love 'em.
- Thank you.

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:30.875
Here! Tell all your homegirls.

01:22:33.583 --> 01:22:35.916
Hey! Hold up. Hold up. Hold Up.

01:22:35.916 --> 01:22:39.083
Hey, we got something for you to try.
The next one you gotta buy, all right?

01:22:39.083 --> 01:22:42.291
What I say? I said, one bag each.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.083
One bag each. We ain't trying to waste it.

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:46.500
- Let 'em enjoy it. What's up?
-  Call 'em back.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.583
Right here!

01:22:47.583 --> 01:22:48.916
Hey, watch it!

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:57.083
They're obsessed.

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:58.458
They're my new favorite.

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:00.500
They're so good.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.875
 What are they?

01:23:02.416 --> 01:23:03.708
Cheetos <i>con chile</i>.

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:04.791
They're flamin' hot.

01:23:04.791 --> 01:23:05.958
Oh.

01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:10.458
Can I get a bag?

01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:13.416
<i>Maybe it looked like a bunch
of Mexicans hustling the streets</i>

01:23:13.416 --> 01:23:15.750
<i>to move a few bags, but the truth was,</i>

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:18.875
<i>we were mobilizing the Hispanic market
before we even knew what it was.</i>

01:23:18.875 --> 01:23:20.041
All right!

01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:23.541
<i>So Enrico wanted answers.</i>

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:26.000
<i>"How are you gonna explain this, fool?</i>

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.625
<i>How's Hot Cheetos got more love on it
than your</i> ruca <i>has got</i> vatos <i>on her,</i> ese<i>?"</i>

01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:33.250
<i>Finley was shitting his pants.
So he was like,</i>

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:36.000
<i>"Man, I don't know
what you're talking about, homes.</i>

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.458
<i>I ain't never heard
of none of these</i> tonterías<i>."</i>

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:42.083
<i>But Al Carey wasn't having it.
So he got super gangster and was like,</i>

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:44.250
<i>"Oh, yeah, you little</i> chavala<i>?</i>

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:49.708
<i>Yo, Patti, how much</i> lana
<i>did this fool put into the product?"</i>

01:23:49.708 --> 01:23:51.708
<i>Man, even Patti was pissed.</i>

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:54.583
Nothing. I mean, he hardly spent a dime.

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:57.125
<i>And then Enrico went OG on 'em.</i>

01:23:57.125 --> 01:24:00.083
<i>"You ain't never
gonna eat another Cheeto in your life.</i>

01:24:00.583 --> 01:24:02.041
<i>You dig,</i> carnal<i>?"</i>

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:05.791
<i>Nah, I'm just playin'.
It didn't go down like that.</i>

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:08.375
<i>You think these fools had that in them?</i>
Chale.

01:24:08.375 --> 01:24:11.833
Here's the latest sales report
on Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

01:24:13.875 --> 01:24:16.333
Whoa, Finley.
How much money did you put into this?

01:24:17.166 --> 01:24:19.875
- Why?
- Because Southern California's blowing up.

01:24:20.708 --> 01:24:23.208
Hmm. That-- That's a blip.

01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:27.708
Look, uh, sir,
why on earth are we still wasting time

01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:30.000
on this janitor's crazy ideas?

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.750
You still think
I'm investing in a janitor?

01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:36.458
Finley, come on.

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:38.291
I'm investing in a vision.

01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:43.125
The Hispanic market is the future,
and this man is going to lead us there.

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:46.125
Better get on board, buddy.

01:24:50.458 --> 01:24:51.750
<i>Compré</i> doughnut.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:53.083
Of course you did, <i>flaco</i>.

01:24:55.583 --> 01:24:56.666
Mmm.

01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:09.833
Maintenance, can I help you?

01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:12.250
<i>Richard? It's Roger Enrico.</i>

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.750
Hello, sir.

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:16.541
<i>We're gonna need more cases.</i>

01:25:17.666 --> 01:25:19.333
Oh-- Yeah-- Okay.

01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:21.375
Yes, sir. Like, how many? Like, 5,000?

01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:25.458
<i>Mmm. No, Richard. Five million.</i>

01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:28.458
<i>We're gonna need five million.</i>

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:30.166
Not playing, are you?

01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:31.416
<i>No, Richard.</i>

01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:35.875
Yes, sir. Um, right away, sir.

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:37.750
Thank you.

01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:46.833
Yeah!

01:25:47.666 --> 01:25:50.166
- All lines go.

01:25:50.916 --> 01:25:52.750
<i>All lines go!</i>

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:32.750
Cheetos FLAMIN' HOT

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:34.000
THEY'RE DANGEROUSLY SPICY!

01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:44.208
6 MONTHS LATER

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.958
<i>Things finally got back
to normal at the factory.</i>

01:26:54.958 --> 01:26:56.541
<i>We all had our shifts back.</i>

01:26:58.416 --> 01:26:59.500
Hey!

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:03.541
- They called?
- They called.

01:27:03.541 --> 01:27:04.625
And?

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:08.250
You're now looking at
the new plant manager in Bakersfield.

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.083
- Oh!
- Yeah!

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:13.083
Oh, yeah! Man, they should have
made you damn president, brother.

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:14.708
Well, you're not wrong.

01:27:16.208 --> 01:27:17.583
They say anything about me?

01:27:21.583 --> 01:27:22.916
But they will.

01:27:22.916 --> 01:27:24.000
They will.

01:27:25.625 --> 01:27:26.833
You'll see.

01:27:29.333 --> 01:27:32.750
Hey, Montañez.
I need you to head up to room C on six.

01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:34.125
I need it cleaned out ASAP.

01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:37.916
Actually, no.

01:27:39.541 --> 01:27:42.625
I'm not gonna do anything until I get
an interview for the machinist gig.

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:43.750
Look, you're on the clock.

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:46.958
Just do the job you got,
and I'll see what I can do. Please.

01:27:58.916 --> 01:28:00.583
Ah, hello, Richard.

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:04.083
Mr. Enrico, what are you--
What are you doing here?

01:28:04.083 --> 01:28:09.375
Ah, I was in town for a convention,
where I told them about your story.

01:28:10.166 --> 01:28:12.708
They loved it.
Of course, I told the shit out of it...

01:28:12.708 --> 01:28:17.666
...'cause it's a story
I know very well, Richard.

01:28:18.458 --> 01:28:23.000
You know, I ran around the mines
of small-town Chisholm, Minnesota

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.375
when I was a snot-nosed Italian kid,

01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:31.750
who had dreams bigger than
what that place could contain.

01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:34.833
The thing is, Richard,

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:38.666
visionaries can't be contained.

01:28:39.791 --> 01:28:42.583
And a smart person
doesn't try to contain them.

01:28:43.083 --> 01:28:48.083
In fact, smarter guys,
like us, invest in vision.

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:51.250
So I'm thinking it's a good idea...

01:28:52.416 --> 01:28:53.666
to invest in yours.

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:58.041
- I-I don't-- I don't understand.
- What do you say?

01:28:59.875 --> 01:29:01.041
You wanna join us?

01:29:03.083 --> 01:29:07.541
And show us the big plans you have
for marketing to your community?

01:29:08.541 --> 01:29:10.000
Um.

01:29:13.416 --> 01:29:16.000
Richard Montañez
Director of Multicultural Marketing

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.416
I had to kick a little ass
to get the <i>Ñ</i> on there for you.

01:29:37.041 --> 01:29:38.041
Wow, I--

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:41.750
For real?

01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:46.083
Richie!

01:29:46.083 --> 01:29:50.083
-  <i>Órale.</i> Let's go, Richie!

01:30:01.166 --> 01:30:03.625
Way to go, baby! East-siders, baby!

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:16.208
I got ya!

01:30:26.416 --> 01:30:30.541
<i>This part...
This part was finally real.</i>

01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.083
Hello, and thank you
for calling Target Warehouse.

01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:12.791
This is Judy. How can I help you?

01:31:12.791 --> 01:31:14.333
Hey, Jude. It's me.

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:16.416
<i>Hey, baby. What's up?</i>

01:31:21.958 --> 01:31:23.333
We're gonna need more ties.

01:31:31.541 --> 01:31:32.541
Oh, my God.

01:31:35.791 --> 01:31:39.208
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

01:31:40.166 --> 01:31:43.791
<i>Well, you see, in this world,
there's no such thing as just a janitor.</i>

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.125
<i>There's no such thing as just a waiter.</i>

01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:54.208
<i>No such thing as just a busboy.</i>

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.291
Thank you so much.

01:31:58.416 --> 01:32:00.791
<i>There's no such thing as just a valet.</i>

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:05.375
<i>No such thing as just a gardener,
mechanic, maid.</i>

01:32:08.333 --> 01:32:12.125
