00:02.040 --> 00:04.880
&lrm;<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:08.080
&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:08.200 --> 00:10.800
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.400
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

00:13.320 --> 00:15.680
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! Simply the best! ♪</i>

00:15.800 --> 00:18.680
&lrm;<i>♪ Up to the test when things go wrong! ♪</i>

00:18.800 --> 00:21.440
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! The luckiest! ♪</i>

00:21.560 --> 00:24.280
&lrm;<i>♪ The power of love, always so strong! ♪</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:27.200
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! ♪</i>

00:30.240 --> 00:33.880
&lrm;I'll let you in on a little secret.
&lrm;I always add cream to chocolate

00:34.000 --> 00:35.920
&lrm;to make the ganache extra velvety.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.400
&lrm;Then I let it infuse for one minute.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.720
&lrm;I love it when your dad comes to class
&lrm;and gives us pastry lessons!

00:41.840 --> 00:43.800
&lrm;Ha, ha! So does he!

00:44.760 --> 00:49.080
&lrm;Do they seriously think I'm going to get
&lrm;my hands dirty cooking, like some maid?

00:49.200 --> 00:52.000
&lrm;If I want a croissant,
&lrm;I just make my butler get it for me!

00:52.120 --> 00:56.080
&lrm;He's not making croissants, Chloé,
&lrm;those are macaroons.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.440
&lrm;It's all done with a flick of the wrist.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.120
&lrm;But don't go too fast,
&lrm;or you might splash yourself!

01:01.240 --> 01:04.879
&lrm;And soil my Chenal pants?
&lrm;Who's he kidding?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.800
&lrm;-Look at this lovely emulsion.
&lrm;-Oh!

01:07.920 --> 01:09.760
&lrm;It's beautiful!

01:17.000 --> 01:20.080
&lrm;Now we need to chill it
&lrm;for half an hour. Marinette?

01:20.680 --> 01:24.160
&lrm;-Yes, Dad?
&lrm;-Could you put this in the fridge, please?

01:24.280 --> 01:27.560
&lrm;In the meantime, I'll show your friends
&lrm;how to whip up egg whites.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.320
&lrm;Of course!

01:33.560 --> 01:37.080
&lrm;-Hmm. Can I get a taste?
&lrm;-Not yet, Tikki!

01:37.200 --> 01:38.960
&lrm;Control that sweet tooth of yours!

01:39.080 --> 01:40.360
&lrm;[laughs]

01:40.480 --> 01:42.560
&lrm;[alarm]

01:43.240 --> 01:44.240
&lrm;Hide, Tikki!

01:44.360 --> 01:48.560
&lrm;Quietly, students! Single-file line!
&lrm;Just keep moving.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.880
&lrm;I hope it's only a fire drill.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.440
&lrm;So, some smart aleck had the bright idea
&lrm;of calling the fire department!

01:57.560 --> 01:59.520
&lrm;Huh?

02:00.120 --> 02:03.840
&lrm;Somebody thought it would be funny
&lrm;to waste the fire captain's time!

02:03.960 --> 02:06.600
&lrm;-Yes, in fact, if you wouldn't mind, I--
&lrm;-Hold on!

02:06.720 --> 02:09.560
&lrm;I want the guilty party
&lrm;to apologise to you!

02:09.680 --> 02:10.960
&lrm;I'm sure it was Chloé!

02:11.080 --> 02:13.760
&lrm;I saw her on the phone
&lrm;right before the alarm went off!

02:14.280 --> 02:17.400
&lrm;You seeing her make a phone call
&lrm;isn't solid proof.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.960
&lrm;-Mr Damocles, sir?
&lrm;-Yes, Miss Bourgeois?

02:21.080 --> 02:24.320
&lrm;I saw someone leave the classroom
&lrm;right before the alarm went off!

02:24.440 --> 02:27.720
&lrm;-It must have been her.
&lrm;-Really? Who was it?

02:27.840 --> 02:30.040
&lrm;Let's see if she'll come clean?

02:30.160 --> 02:33.320
&lrm;What do you say, Marinette Dupain-Cheng?

02:33.440 --> 02:36.560
&lrm;Marinette, do you have
&lrm;something to tell the captain?

02:36.680 --> 02:39.960
&lrm;Uh, wait. Excuse me, sir,
&lrm;but it couldn't possibly be Marinette.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.600
&lrm;Why would she disrupt
&lrm;her father's cooking class?

02:42.720 --> 02:47.160
&lrm;And I know she didn't have her phone
&lrm;on her when she left the classroom!

02:47.280 --> 02:50.560
&lrm;-Mr Damocles, I must be heading--
&lrm;-Just one more second!

02:50.680 --> 02:52.640
&lrm;We're very close to discover the truth!

02:52.760 --> 02:56.400
&lrm;-Oh...
&lrm;-Well, we all know it can't be me!

02:56.520 --> 02:59.600
&lrm;I'm not gonna let her get away with this!
&lrm;I've gotta tell--

02:59.720 --> 03:02.560
&lrm;Hang on, Marinette.
&lrm;We don't know for sure that it was her.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.760
&lrm;He's right. Let's not stoop to her level!

03:04.880 --> 03:06.000
&lrm;[chuckles]

03:06.120 --> 03:09.800
&lrm;I really have to leave now. Just call me
&lrm;if you find out who the prankster is.

03:09.920 --> 03:14.120
&lrm;Fine! Since no one is owning up,
&lrm;the whole school will be punished!

03:14.720 --> 03:19.320
&lrm;What? I'm not so sure my father will react
&lrm;kindly to me being punished without proof!

03:19.440 --> 03:22.760
&lrm;Oh, no, please!
&lrm;Don't disturb the busy mayor!

03:22.880 --> 03:25.680
&lrm;The whole school is punished,
&lrm;except for Miss Bourgeois!

03:26.560 --> 03:28.160
&lrm;Yeah, that's more like it!

03:28.760 --> 03:32.480
&lrm;Now you know how we deal with anyone
&lrm;who misuses the fire department's time!

03:32.600 --> 03:34.200
&lrm;OK, great!

03:34.320 --> 03:35.280
&lrm;Bye!

03:40.120 --> 03:44.400
&lrm;-Do you see what just went down?
&lrm;-I know! Adrien just talked to my ear!

03:45.240 --> 03:46.880
&lrm;Seriously, Marinette?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.840
&lrm;[sweeping]

03:51.560 --> 03:56.040
&lrm;Can't you see I'm trying to relax here?
&lrm;Go sweep somewhere else, Cinderella!

04:01.960 --> 04:04.000
&lrm;Adri-kins!

04:09.400 --> 04:12.480
&lrm;Of course it was me who called
&lrm;the fire department! So what?

04:12.600 --> 04:15.080
&lrm;It doesn't bother you
&lrm;they've all been punished?

04:15.200 --> 04:20.320
&lrm;No, why would it? They all seemed
&lrm;to enjoy getting dirty making cookies.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.600
&lrm;How's it different than cleaning floors?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.200
&lrm;They should be thanking me, if anything!

04:25.320 --> 04:28.000
&lrm;Chloé,
&lrm;how long have you and I been friends?

04:28.120 --> 04:32.000
&lrm;Since we were adorable little tots,
&lrm;Adri-kins!

04:32.120 --> 04:35.360
&lrm;Well, I'm sorry Chloé,
&lrm;but I can't be friends with someone

04:35.480 --> 04:36.920
&lrm;who treats others like this.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.200
&lrm;You've got to be nice to people!

04:39.320 --> 04:41.080
&lrm;N... Nice?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.280
&lrm;Yes, nice. It's not that hard!

04:53.800 --> 04:56.400
&lrm;Mademoiselle does not look
&lrm;very happy today.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.760
&lrm;[sobs]

05:04.880 --> 05:09.320
&lrm;Adrien says I have to be nice to everyone
&lrm;or he won't be my friend any more!

05:09.440 --> 05:12.280
&lrm;How can he do this to me, Jean-Michel?

05:12.400 --> 05:15.360
&lrm;Uh, my name is... Hmm. Never mind.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.400
&lrm;Perhaps Mademoiselle
&lrm;can seek comfort with Mr Cuddly?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.560
&lrm;If you would allow it, Mademoiselle,

05:25.680 --> 05:28.640
&lrm;I could help you
&lrm;keep your friendship with Adrien.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.600
&lrm;Why would you do a thing like that,
&lrm;Jean-Jacques?

05:31.720 --> 05:34.400
&lrm;Because that's
&lrm;what being nice is all about.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.640
&lrm;I'm sure Mademoiselle can remember
&lrm;when she was a little girl,

05:38.760 --> 05:41.840
&lrm;when Mr Cuddly was always nice
&lrm;to Mademoiselle when she was sad.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.880
&lrm;Mr Cuddly can teach you
&lrm;how to be kind to others.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.000
&lrm;I remember, Jean-Luc! Adrien's
&lrm;going to see just how nice I can be!

05:54.120 --> 05:55.400
&lrm;Hmm.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.760
&lrm;These are jewels I design
&lrm;that you can customise yourself.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.320
&lrm;Ooh!

06:05.800 --> 06:08.840
&lrm;-They're so cute!
&lrm;-Hold on! Nobody move!

06:11.080 --> 06:15.760
&lrm;This one would make an awesome home
&lrm;page image your future blog, wouldn't it?

06:15.880 --> 06:18.840
&lrm;-Chloé?
&lrm;-What does that bratty snob want?

06:18.960 --> 06:21.520
&lrm;Chloé's inviting me to a party!

06:21.640 --> 06:24.280
&lrm;-Me too!
&lrm;-Me too.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.280
&lrm;-Me too.
&lrm;-That's so nice of Chloé!

06:27.400 --> 06:30.480
&lrm;"Chloé" and "nice" in the same sentence?
&lrm;Can't be her.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.920
&lrm;Maybe somebody hacked her phone, then.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.760
&lrm;-I haven't received a text.
&lrm;-Then that means it must be Chloé!

06:39.520 --> 06:41.560
&lrm;Ugh! The baker girl as well?

06:41.680 --> 06:43.960
&lrm;It's what Mr Cuddly would do, yes.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.920
&lrm;Ugh!

06:49.120 --> 06:53.240
&lrm;-Ew! She invited me!
&lrm;-Awesome! This will be so much fun!

06:53.360 --> 06:55.440
&lrm;Wait! You're actually gonna go?

06:55.560 --> 07:00.520
&lrm;She probably wants to say sorry.
&lrm;Maybe she's nice... very, very deep down.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.600
&lrm;Chloé?
&lrm;No. She's the exact opposite of nice!

07:03.720 --> 07:07.800
&lrm;Whatever. You guys can go,
&lrm;but don't count me in!

07:07.920 --> 07:10.840
&lrm;It's Nino.
&lrm;He's going to the party with Adrien.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.280
&lrm;OK, yes, you guys are right.
&lrm;We should give Chloé one more chance.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.600
&lrm;A party being thrown
&lrm;by the most spiteful girl in all of Paris?

07:20.720 --> 07:24.240
&lrm;Such a fertile breeding ground
&lrm;for negative emotions!

07:32.560 --> 07:35.520
&lrm;Fly away, my evil akuma!

07:35.640 --> 07:38.920
&lrm;Finding a victim
&lrm;to evilise should be a piece of cake!

07:53.200 --> 07:56.560
&lrm;Mademoiselle should go greet her guests
&lrm;in a welcoming manner,

07:56.680 --> 07:58.520
&lrm;with a hug and a kiss.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.000
&lrm;You're kidding, Jean-Claude?

08:00.120 --> 08:02.680
&lrm;You really expect me
&lrm;to let their cheeks touch mine?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.480
&lrm;Well, it's what Mr Cuddly would do.

08:05.600 --> 08:10.920
&lrm;This way you will prove to your good
&lrm;friend Adrien that you really are nice.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.880
&lrm;This whole party thing's way weird.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.320
&lrm;Well, I've known Chloé for a long time,
&lrm;and she can actually be cool sometimes!

08:17.440 --> 08:19.080
&lrm;Adri-kins!

08:20.680 --> 08:23.840
&lrm;What do you think of me hosting a party?
&lrm;Really nice of me, right?

08:23.960 --> 08:25.440
&lrm;It's awesome, Chloé!

08:25.560 --> 08:28.400
&lrm;-Hey, there!
&lrm;-Hey, Chloé!

08:28.520 --> 08:30.480
&lrm;Thanks for the invite, Chloé.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.960
&lrm;Ugh!

08:47.840 --> 08:49.880
&lrm;[gasping]

08:54.800 --> 08:57.680
&lrm;Ha, ha, ha!
&lrm;I should've got you guys on video!

08:57.800 --> 08:59.360
&lrm;Don't rub it in!

09:09.080 --> 09:12.320
&lrm;I did it. Adrien seems happy.
&lrm;Are we done now?

09:12.440 --> 09:16.240
&lrm;If I may be so bold, in order to reaffirm
&lrm;Adrien of her kindness,

09:16.360 --> 09:19.600
&lrm;Mademoiselle might go and check
&lrm;her guests are having a good time.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.800
&lrm;And why would I do that, Jean-Marc?

09:21.920 --> 09:24.360
&lrm;Because that's what Mr Cuddly would do.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.600
&lrm;All right! Fine! I get it!

09:30.640 --> 09:31.840
&lrm;Aaah!

09:32.440 --> 09:35.040
&lrm;Having a good time?

09:36.160 --> 09:40.080
&lrm;Woo! All this dancing's made me thirsty!
&lrm;Do you know where the ice cubes are?

09:40.200 --> 09:43.240
&lrm;How should I know?
&lrm;I'm not your servant! Find them yourself!

09:43.840 --> 09:47.160
&lrm;And if you're so hot, why not take off
&lrm;your fake, sheepskin sweater?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.520
&lrm;-Throw it in the trash, where it belongs!
&lrm;-Oh!

09:49.640 --> 09:52.680
&lrm;I knew I wouldn't have to wait very long.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.120
&lrm;Ahem!

09:56.920 --> 09:58.280
&lrm;[fake laugh]

09:58.400 --> 10:01.080
&lrm;I'm totally joking. I love mutton!

10:01.960 --> 10:03.800
&lrm;I'll get you those ice cubes!

10:10.080 --> 10:11.840
&lrm;What are you doing, Miss Bourgeois?

10:11.960 --> 10:14.680
&lrm;Where's that natural cruelty
&lrm;I'm counting on?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.440
&lrm;This BFF act she's doing
&lrm;is just one big charade!

10:17.560 --> 10:21.000
&lrm;-She's just doing it to please Adrien!
&lrm;-Ahem! How funny!

10:21.120 --> 10:25.280
&lrm;Reminds me of a girl who didn't want to go
&lrm;to a party till she heard Adrien would go.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.520
&lrm;Please don't compare me to Chloé!

10:39.120 --> 10:40.480
&lrm;[slow music starts]

10:45.680 --> 10:48.520
&lrm;Chloé, how about a dance
&lrm;with an awesome guy?

10:48.640 --> 10:51.200
&lrm;-I'd love it. Where is he?
&lrm;-Hmm?

10:58.280 --> 11:01.160
&lrm;Oh, here he is, right in front of me!

11:06.360 --> 11:07.520
&lrm;Grr!

11:16.720 --> 11:21.840
&lrm;-Go over and ask him, girl!
&lrm;-Uh? What? Adrien? No! You're crazy!

11:24.080 --> 11:26.880
&lrm;-Hey, Marinette! You wanna dance?
&lrm;-Uh...

11:46.920 --> 11:49.560
&lrm;What? I am speechless!

11:49.680 --> 11:52.960
&lrm;Thanks!
&lrm;You're a pretty good dancer yourself!

12:01.440 --> 12:03.760
&lrm;See?
&lrm;Chloé's on her best behaviour tonight.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.320
&lrm;I'm not letting her dance with Adrien
&lrm;under my roof!

12:34.440 --> 12:36.560
&lrm;Hey! The song's not over yet!

12:37.720 --> 12:40.760
&lrm;-If I may say, Mademoiselle ought to--
&lrm;-Move, Jean-Jacques!

12:40.880 --> 12:42.720
&lrm;Oh, please, Chloé dear!

12:42.840 --> 12:44.800
&lrm;You've been such a good little girl!

12:44.920 --> 12:47.480
&lrm;Mr Cuddly's so very proud of you!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.240
&lrm;Is that your teddy bear, Chloé?

12:49.360 --> 12:51.240
&lrm;[laughter]

12:51.360 --> 12:55.360
&lrm;I've had it with your stupid teddy bear,
&lrm;your stupid advice, and you,

12:55.480 --> 12:59.560
&lrm;-Jean-whatever-your-stupid-name-is!
&lrm;-Mademoiselle, I was trying to help.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.480
&lrm;There's no more "Mademoiselle,"
&lrm;no more help, no more anything!

13:03.600 --> 13:06.320
&lrm;You are fired! Now get out!

13:08.440 --> 13:12.080
&lrm;Ah! I knew I wouldn't be disappointed!

13:15.960 --> 13:19.400
&lrm;Hello, Despair Bear, I am Hawk Moth.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.120
&lrm;You've always been
&lrm;such a good influence on Chloé.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.720
&lrm;But now you get to be
&lrm;a bad influence for everyone,

13:25.840 --> 13:28.360
&lrm;and a very evil one, at that!

13:28.480 --> 13:30.680
&lrm;With great pleasure, sir.

13:36.920 --> 13:41.560
&lrm;You've been very naughty, Chloé-kins,
&lrm;and Despair Bear is not proud of you!

13:41.680 --> 13:44.200
&lrm;The time has come to make you pay!

13:57.840 --> 14:01.080
&lrm;-Come here, Chloé.
&lrm;-Sabrina? What's gotten into you?

14:01.200 --> 14:04.160
&lrm;Let me brush your hair.
&lrm;I promise I won't hurt you.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.640
&lrm;Aaah! Somebody stop her!

14:11.360 --> 14:14.440
&lrm;Touch one hair on Chloé's head
&lrm;and you'll have to answer to me!

14:14.560 --> 14:19.280
&lrm;Oh! What a gentleman! Despair Bear
&lrm;praises a knight in shining armour!

14:24.080 --> 14:27.800
&lrm;I think I've had too much orange juice.
&lrm;I gotta go. See ya!

14:27.920 --> 14:31.080
&lrm;No problem.
&lrm;I have something to do anyway! See ya!

14:32.840 --> 14:34.720
&lrm;-Chloé?
&lrm;-Don't you come near me!

14:34.840 --> 14:38.000
&lrm;-Why? What's going on?
&lrm;-Kim, do something!

14:38.120 --> 14:41.480
&lrm;-Would you like to dance, Chloé?
&lrm;-Ugh!

14:42.800 --> 14:46.880
&lrm;I gotta transform, Tikki!
&lrm;Too bad I had to stop dancing with Adrien.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.240
&lrm;It felt like I was dancing
&lrm;on a little cloud!

14:49.360 --> 14:51.680
&lrm;An out-of-body experience! It was like...

14:51.800 --> 14:53.360
&lrm;Marinette! Focus!

14:53.480 --> 14:54.680
&lrm;[groaning]

14:54.800 --> 14:56.560
&lrm;OK! Back down to Earth.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.840
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

15:17.960 --> 15:20.800
&lrm;Let go, you evil dork!
&lrm;You're messing up my hair!

15:20.920 --> 15:24.120
&lrm;-I hope you're having fun, Chloé-kins!
&lrm;-Whoa!

15:30.880 --> 15:32.760
&lrm;About time! What took you so long?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.080
&lrm;That's a very slippery dance floor!

15:46.240 --> 15:48.000
&lrm;Aaah! A mouse!

15:48.600 --> 15:49.840
&lrm;Move aside, all of you!

15:53.560 --> 15:54.680
&lrm;Look out!

15:55.320 --> 15:58.200
&lrm;How about a little game of Flying Chairs?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.520
&lrm;Ladybug! What happened?

16:14.440 --> 16:16.640
&lrm;-Cat Noir?
&lrm;-Huh? Where'd he go?

16:22.240 --> 16:24.080
&lrm;What are you doing?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.760
&lrm;-Oh! Oh, no!
&lrm;-Despair Bear!

16:26.880 --> 16:30.480
&lrm;If you want to continue playing this game,
&lrm;give me Ladybug's Miraculous!

16:30.600 --> 16:32.440
&lrm;Oh! Pretty earrings!

16:35.000 --> 16:37.880
&lrm;Cat Noir, it's me! Stop it!

16:40.880 --> 16:42.760
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:46.360 --> 16:47.800
&lrm;Paws off, kitty!

16:50.840 --> 16:53.920
&lrm;-Thank you!
&lrm;-Hey, I was really nice just then!

16:54.040 --> 16:56.040
&lrm;Did you see? No?

16:56.160 --> 16:57.520
&lrm;You're all so lame!

16:58.120 --> 16:59.800
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

17:06.240 --> 17:08.880
&lrm;-A fork?
&lrm;-You little brat!

17:14.040 --> 17:16.480
&lrm;She's crazy,
&lrm;she's never gone make it without me!

17:25.599 --> 17:26.480
&lrm;OK!

17:35.160 --> 17:37.080
&lrm;Hey, stop! Oh!

17:41.520 --> 17:43.400
&lrm;Naughty, naughty Ladybug!

17:48.720 --> 17:50.480
&lrm;Chloé, would you be so kind?

17:53.520 --> 17:54.920
&lrm;OK, Ladybug!

18:03.040 --> 18:04.440
&lrm;No, stop! What's happening?

18:05.720 --> 18:07.760
&lrm;Ladybug? What are you doing?

18:07.880 --> 18:11.480
&lrm;Oh, nothing. Just saving your skin
&lrm;with the help of our new sidekick!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.760
&lrm;Give me your Miraculous!
&lrm;You haven't defeated me yet!

18:15.880 --> 18:17.480
&lrm;Watch your step, Cat Noir!

18:19.280 --> 18:22.320
&lrm;I've got this little guy under control.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.400
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

18:32.040 --> 18:34.080
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:37.920 --> 18:39.680
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:39.800 --> 18:41.400
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.440
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:53.840 --> 18:57.120
&lrm;Thanks for helping me out there.
&lrm;That was... really nice of you!

18:57.240 --> 19:00.720
&lrm;-I know, wasn't it?
&lrm;-Mademoiselle, I must confess

19:00.840 --> 19:04.200
&lrm;-I don't remember anything.
&lrm;-Well, basically, you turned evil,

19:04.320 --> 19:06.360
&lrm;and I saved you. In fact, without me,

19:06.480 --> 19:08.760
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;wouldn't have succeeded!

19:08.880 --> 19:12.760
&lrm;I'm even better than you superheroes.
&lrm;I don't even need a costume!

19:16.280 --> 19:18.240
&lrm;-Gotta get going!
&lrm;-Yeah, me too.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.760
&lrm;You know what?
&lrm;I'm suddenly feeling very generous.

19:21.880 --> 19:25.400
&lrm;I think that thing of yours
&lrm;about being nice might make some sense.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.680
&lrm;-I've decided to keep you on after all!
&lrm;-Mademoiselle is so kind.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.080
&lrm;Don't let the guests go away,
&lrm;Jean-Baptiste.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.480
&lrm;They mustn't miss what's coming up next!

19:36.920 --> 19:39.200
&lrm;Ladybug, if you hadn't been helped,

19:39.320 --> 19:41.800
&lrm;defeating you
&lrm;would have been child's play!

19:41.920 --> 19:47.120
&lrm;So you'd better watch out.
&lrm;Your day of devastation is coming soon.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.760
&lrm;Great job, kids!
&lrm;You've done some really good work!

19:51.880 --> 19:52.920
&lrm;[cheering]

19:53.040 --> 19:55.440
&lrm;That was a great idea,
&lrm;inviting Marinette's dad!

19:55.560 --> 19:59.280
&lrm;I know! This way, no one can be mad at me
&lrm;for calling the fire department.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.240
&lrm;I'm really nice now.
&lrm;Did you notice, Adri-kins?

20:02.360 --> 20:05.440
&lrm;Even Ladybug said so.
&lrm;Didn't she, Jean-Pascal?

20:05.560 --> 20:10.160
&lrm;I'm proud of you, Chloé! You've proven
&lrm;you can be nicer to everyone.

20:10.280 --> 20:15.560
&lrm;Oh, Adri-kins, so we'll always be
&lrm;best friends forever? Pinky swear?

20:15.680 --> 20:16.760
&lrm;Pinky swear.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.400
&lrm;Phew!

20:22.600 --> 20:24.360
&lrm;So...

20:24.480 --> 20:26.800
&lrm;Those macaroons are dreadfully ugly!

20:28.040 --> 20:30.560
&lrm;Those are so greasy
&lrm;you could see yourself in them!

20:32.200 --> 20:34.200
&lrm;Ugh! Too disgusting for comment!

20:34.320 --> 20:35.840
&lrm;Yours look horrible!

20:35.960 --> 20:37.800
&lrm;She'll never change.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.280
&lrm;-May I?
&lrm;-Yeah, sure!

20:40.400 --> 20:41.760
&lrm;I mean, what?

20:42.360 --> 20:45.320
&lrm;-Have a macaroon.
&lrm;-Yes! Of course.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.520
&lrm;Oh, sorry! I'm so clumsy!

20:50.640 --> 20:51.880
&lrm;It's OK!

20:53.360 --> 20:56.760
&lrm;Wow, this is really good!
&lrm;Your baking is as good as your dancing.
