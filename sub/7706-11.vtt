Interesting
concept --
The pencil.

00:09.934 --> 00:11.701
Where did it
come from ?

00:11.767 --> 00:14.968
I've heard a number
of theories on that.

00:15.033 --> 00:16.801
How about the
shortest one ?

00:16.868 --> 00:19.100
The stationery store.

00:19.167 --> 00:22.100
Thank you.

00:24.934 --> 00:29.267
That's a
voter registration
application.

00:29.334 --> 00:31.634
Can't fool you.

00:31.701 --> 00:35.968

until we see blue dots ?

01:47.033 --> 01:50.167
No, we're watching the
presidential debate on tv.

You're voting in this election.
The issues are important.

01:56.467 --> 01:58.834
Listen to your mother.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.734
You don't.

02:00.801 --> 02:02.701
<i>She's not my mother.</i>

02:02.767 --> 02:06.100

the mall with julie.

02:06.167 --> 02:10.199
Lizard got a job at the
weiner-On-A-Stick place.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.400

change the subject.

04:25.634 --> 04:28.601
In answer to
your question --

04:28.667 --> 04:34.701
As joe biden once said,
"we have nothing to fear
but fear itself."

04:34.767 --> 04:38.434
By arming ourselves
against the impossible,

04:38.501 --> 04:40.934
We are preventing
the unthinkable ...

04:41.000 --> 04:43.100
From becoming
the inevitable.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.167
Double-Talk.

04:45.234 --> 04:47.868
Preventing war
is easy.

04:52.934 --> 04:56.734
International politics
is very complex.

04:56.801 --> 04:58.400
The soviets want peace
and so do we.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.634
But we're
separated by ...

05:00.701 --> 05:02.968
History, ideology,
economic philosophy ...

05:03.033 --> 05:05.434
You sound just like

05:17.801 --> 05:19.400
Wow !

05:19.467 --> 05:22.234
Kate, maybe you should
become president.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.300
Are you decent ?

05:28.367 --> 05:29.968
Would it matter ?

05:30.033 --> 05:31.834

05:33.501 --> 05:35.100
<i>Oh, there

05:35.167 --> 05:37.667
With that light
behind you,

05:37.734 --> 05:39.334
I could see
your silhouette.

<i>You look ...</i>

05:42.167 --> 05:43.534

05:43.601 --> 05:46.000
I was gonna say you
look like an angel.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.634

05:47.701 --> 05:49.234
A naked angel.

05:50.901 --> 05:52.734
What do you want ?

05:52.801 --> 05:55.834
I keep thinking
about the debate.

05:55.901 --> 06:00.801
I noticed those politicians
never give simple answers.

06:00.868 --> 06:04.234
That's because the issues
are so complicated.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.033
I think the voters would like
answers they could understand.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.934
Like your answer to
unemployment --

06:10.000 --> 06:13.667
Hire the jobless to give
you piggy-Back rides.

06:13.734 --> 06:17.300
If i can
restore a man's dignity
by climbing on his back,

06:17.367 --> 06:19.868
I say go for it.

06:19.934 --> 06:24.167
You can't understand
our democratic process ...

06:24.234 --> 06:27.901
Because you're not looking
at the big picture.

06:27.968 --> 06:30.767
The big picture
over the piano ?

06:30.834 --> 06:35.501
No.By big picture,
i mean --

06:35.567 --> 06:40.133
<i>Because i can look at that,
if i stand on the piano.</i>

06:41.501 --> 06:44.133
"Big picture" means --

06:44.200 --> 06:46.667
It's all right.

06:46.734 --> 06:49.868
If alf wants to look
at the big picture
over the piano,

06:49.934 --> 06:51.567
Let him.

06:51.634 --> 06:54.133
I am going to bed.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.400
Thank you, kate.

06:55.467 --> 06:59.200
Just don't get any fur
between the keys.

06:59.267 --> 07:01.767
All right, but don't
lock your door.

07:01.834 --> 07:05.834

political questions for you.

08:34.133 --> 08:37.033
I'd rub them
on a big sweater,

12:45.701 --> 12:47.567
Go back to sleep,
willie.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.767
This doesn't
concern you.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.167
Okay.

12:54.234 --> 12:56.834
I have another stupid
question, kate.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.667
Why do all those
candidates look alike ?

13:03.334 --> 13:05.534
That's not a
stupid question.

13:05.601 --> 13:07.033
Sorry.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.567
That's okay.

13:08.634 --> 13:11.767
One reason that all the
candidates look alike ...

13:11.834 --> 13:13.501
Is that they have
image consultants;

13:13.567 --> 13:16.100
People who
advise the --

13:16.167 --> 13:18.367
Why am i telling
you this ?

13:18.434 --> 13:23.100
I thought you were trying
to lull me to sleep.

13:23.167 --> 13:26.067
Get out
of here.

13:26.133 --> 13:30.434
You're pretty cranky
at 3:14 am.

13:30.501 --> 13:34.667
I hope you're more
sociable at 5:28.

13:44.868 --> 13:46.934
Hi.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.434
What did you think
of my debate ?

13:49.501 --> 13:51.367
You were
great,
honey.

13:51.434 --> 13:54.000
Yeah, mom,
you were terrific.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.567
Neat.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.100
Really ?

13:57.167 --> 13:58.701
Hey, tell her the truth.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.400
I saw it.
You stunk.

14:00.467 --> 14:05.100
P.U.Odor city.
You shouldn't be president.

14:05.167 --> 14:08.868
You should be foreman
at the skunk works.

14:08.934 --> 14:12.968
Thank you for your
constructive criticism.

14:13.033 --> 14:15.701
We still love you, mom.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.801
Love, shmuv.
You need help.

14:17.868 --> 14:19.167
My card.

14:19.234 --> 14:23.434
"Gordon shumway.
Image consultant."

14:23.501 --> 14:25.901
The ink is
still wet.

14:25.968 --> 14:29.467
First, we need to lose
2" off that skirt.

14:29.534 --> 14:31.734
We'll pin
it up later.

14:31.801 --> 14:33.834
Now the name ...
kate tanner ...

14:33.901 --> 14:36.133
It doesn't
say "power."

14:36.200 --> 14:39.934
It says
"wipe your feet,
i just mopped."

14:40.000 --> 14:43.267
All right ... what name
would you suggest ?

14:43.334 --> 14:46.000
Let's see ...
whoopi tanner.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.901
No.

14:47.968 --> 14:49.701
Indira tanner.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.367
No, i got it.

14:51.434 --> 14:54.601
Mary tyler tanner.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.267
No, no.I've
got a better one.

14:57.334 --> 14:58.834
Come with me.

14:58.901 --> 15:00.100
Come on.

15:01.968 --> 15:06.200
Now representing the
new and improved party,

15:06.267 --> 15:09.834
Ms. Sigourney tanner.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.000
That's more
like it.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.367
That's more
like it.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.534
<i>That's more
like it.</i>

15:18.601 --> 15:20.667
<i>That's more
like it.</i>

15:20.734 --> 15:22.634
<i> That's more
 like it.</i>

15:22.701 --> 15:25.834
Yeah, that's
more like it.

15:25.901 --> 15:27.801
Oh.

15:27.868 --> 15:30.267
Not you again.

15:30.334 --> 15:32.801
Would you be happier
if i were a burglar ?

15:32.868 --> 15:36.033
At this point, yes.

15:36.100 --> 15:40.133
Okay, give me your purse.

15:41.434 --> 15:44.534
Why are you wearing
willie's robe ?

15:44.601 --> 15:49.033
I decided that i
want to be president.

15:49.100 --> 15:55.133
Do you like this look
for my fireside chats ?

15:56.968 --> 16:00.834
I'll be in the kitchen
making bumper stickers.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.133
Eeney,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
Meeney,

16:08.267 --> 16:09.367
Miney ...

16:11.400 --> 16:12.801
Gabon.

16:13.834 --> 16:16.467
<i>Yes, mr. President ?</i>

16:16.534 --> 16:18.667
Send a memo to gabon.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.501
Ask if they need
foreign aid,

16:20.567 --> 16:24.434
Or if they want sally struthers
to adopt some kids.

16:24.501 --> 16:26.300
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

16:26.367 --> 16:28.400
<i>And there's a
kate tanner
to see you.</i>

16:28.467 --> 16:29.734
That's my kate.

16:29.801 --> 16:32.267
Send her in.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.300
Kate, long time no see.

16:36.367 --> 16:37.834
Hello, mr. President.

16:37.901 --> 16:39.868
What do you think
of the office ?

16:41.467 --> 16:43.601
It's oval.

16:45.501 --> 16:47.367
Popcorn ?

16:47.434 --> 16:50.567
I popped it over
the eternal flame.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.367
Why did you
call me here ?

16:54.868 --> 16:58.434
Because i want you
in my cabinet.

16:59.734 --> 17:03.667
<i>Right between the ben gay
and the dental floss.</i>

17:03.734 --> 17:06.166
Ha ha ha !

17:06.233 --> 17:09.000
Just kidding.

17:09.067 --> 17:13.367
You haven't lost your boyish
sense of humor, mr. President.

17:13.434 --> 17:17.867
Why else would i
appoint judge reinhold ...

17:17.934 --> 17:20.334
To the supreme court ?

17:20.400 --> 17:23.934
The president
has a lot of
serious problems ...

17:24.000 --> 17:25.934
[ Burp ]

17:26.000 --> 17:27.601
To deal with.

17:27.666 --> 17:31.400
For example --
What do you plan to do
about the homeless ?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.868
It's done.

17:32.934 --> 17:33.868
What ?

17:35.634 --> 17:38.501
I had houses built
for each of them.

17:38.567 --> 17:41.868
And what about
unemployment ?

17:41.934 --> 17:43.734
There is none.

17:43.801 --> 17:46.334
Everybody's
building houses.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.801
I suppose people aren't
fighting wars anymore ?

17:49.868 --> 17:52.033
Who's got time
to fight ?

17:52.100 --> 17:55.868
They're all picking out
wallpaper for new homes.

17:55.934 --> 18:00.734
I don't think
the country's problems
can be solved that easily.

18:00.801 --> 18:03.400
Sure they can.
Look outside.

18:07.901 --> 18:08.834
[ Burp ]

18:08.901 --> 18:12.601
Everybody's dancing
in the street.

18:12.667 --> 18:18.033
There was lots of room after we
swept up the dead stock brokers.

18:18.100 --> 18:21.467
Looks like the old alfer
came through, huh ?

18:21.534 --> 18:25.200
I must say,
i'm impressed.

18:25.267 --> 18:28.901
You've solved 200 years
of problems in one week.

18:28.968 --> 18:32.167
Actually, i took
the weekend off.

18:32.234 --> 18:34.200
I went to camp david.

18:34.267 --> 18:36.667
See this neat
wallet i made ?

18:37.767 --> 18:39.934
Very nice.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.067
<i>[ Buzz ]</i>

18:41.133 --> 18:43.734
<i>Sir, the ayatollah
returned your call.</i>

18:43.801 --> 18:45.934
<i>He's sorry about
mining the gulf,</i>

18:46.000 --> 18:49.200
<i>And he'd love to be
the white house santa
this year.</i>

18:49.267 --> 18:51.367
Thanks, fawn.

18:51.434 --> 18:56.000
Well, i guess you are
a good president.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.601
<i>[ Ring ]</i>

18:58.667 --> 19:01.267
Don't worry, it's
the black phone.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.868
President here.

19:05.934 --> 19:08.400
Really ?

19:08.467 --> 19:11.234
Yeah,
no problem !

19:11.300 --> 19:13.267
Thank you !

19:13.334 --> 19:17.067
Excuse me.
I'm off to south dakota.

19:17.133 --> 19:21.501
I've got a rendezvous
with history.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.167
<i>What do you
think, kate ?</i>

19:32.234 --> 19:33.734
Huh ?

19:33.801 --> 19:37.567
I think you look silly
next to abe lincoln.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.767
And i think valerie should
have stayed with her family.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.501
But hey --
It's her career.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.367
Alf.

19:48.434 --> 19:50.200
What do you
want, now ?

19:50.267 --> 19:52.200
I finally
figured out ...

19:52.267 --> 19:56.167
Why your political system
is so complicated.

19:56.234 --> 19:59.701
That's just the way
your world works.

19:59.767 --> 20:03.767
I guess things were
simpler on melmac, huh ?

20:03.834 --> 20:08.167
Yeah,
if we didn't understand
something, we broke it.

20:10.767 --> 20:13.501
Good night, kate.

20:13.567 --> 20:16.767
Good night, alf.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.467
Mom, have you seen --

20:26.534 --> 20:27.667
Shh !

20:27.734 --> 20:29.734
Sorry.

20:29.801 --> 20:31.467
Uh, lynn ?

20:33.300 --> 20:36.234
Can you get me
out of here ?
