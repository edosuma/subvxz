-OKAY, SO WHAT ARE YOU
TELLING ME NOW?

09:50.894 --> 09:52.766
YOU'RE QUITTING? IS THAT IT?
-NO, I'M TELLING YOU
I'M FACING FACTS.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.072
-NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME.
YOU ARE QUITTING.

ABOUT YOUR OTHER BACK PROBLEM.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.994
-WHAT OTHER BACK PROBLEM?

10:04.125 --> 10:07.998
-THAT STREAK OF YELLOW
THAT'S RUNNING STRAIGHT
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF YOURS.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.056
-LET'S TRY THAT ONCE AGAIN.

10:32.806 --> 10:33.937

-HEY, HOBIE.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.008
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:04.402 --> 11:07.841
-I'M TRYING TO MOVE MY FOOT.
-IS IT MOVING?

11:14.717 --> 11:17.633
-NO.
-WELL, ARE YOU TRYING
AS HARD AS YOU CAN?

11:17.764 --> 11:20.114
ARE YOU FOCUSING?
-DID SOPHIE SEND YOU IN HERE?

11:20.941 --> 11:23.073
-WHAT?
-NEVER MIND.

11:23.204 --> 11:27.774
-DAD, I BET IF YOU,
LIKE, REALLY CONCENTRATE,
YOU CAN MOVE YOUR FOOT.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.125
HERE, TRY TO KNOCK
THIS CAN OVER.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.171

YOU CAN DO IT!

11:39.481 --> 11:41.091
FOCUS! FOCUS!

11:43.703 --> 11:47.489
TRY AS HARD AS YOU CAN.
COME ON! YOU CAN DO IT,
AND I KNOW IT, DAD! COME ON!

11:47.619 --> 11:50.884

-HOBIE! WHAT'S WRONG?

12:04.245 --> 12:06.508
-MY DAD'S MAD AT ME
JUST BECAUSE I WANTED HIM
TO MOVE HIS FOOT.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.728
-WHAT-- HEY, HOBIE--

12:24.134 --> 12:26.136
YOUR SON JUST RAN
OUT OF THE ROOM CRYING.

12:26.267 --> 12:30.010
-I KNOW. I KNOW.
I GOT FRUSTRATED,
AND I TOOK IT OUT ON HIM.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.360
-YOU'RE AN ADULT, HE'S A CHILD,
AND HE'S SCARED TO DEATH.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.144
-WELL, ADULTS CAN BE SCARED TOO!
-MITCH!

12:34.275 --> 12:35.232
-WHAT?

12:36.973 --> 12:41.151
-LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,
BUT HOBIE NEEDS YOU.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.550
-I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'LL GO FIND HIM.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.614
HOBIE!

13:32.681 --> 13:35.466
-HOBIE, WHAT'S WRONG?
-NOTHING. I'M FINE.

13:37.468 --> 13:40.428
-I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR, MAN,
NOT IN A COMA. WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:42.343 --> 13:43.561
-NOTHING.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.304
WHAT'S IT LIKE?
I MEAN...

13:48.001 --> 13:51.918
REALLY LIKE, YOU KNOW,
BEING PARALYZED?

13:52.048 --> 13:55.051
-MAN, THAT'S A HARD QUESTION.
IT'S LIKE...

13:55.182 --> 13:57.184
EVERY DAY, WHEN I WAKE UP...

13:59.229 --> 14:02.929
FOR THE TINIEST SECOND,
I FORGET THAT I HAVE TO GET HELP

14:03.059 --> 14:05.235
TO GET OUT OF BED
AND BE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.978
AND THEN, THE WHOLE
REST OF MY DAY, MAN...

14:09.109 --> 14:10.762
THERE'S NO WAY I FORGET.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.941
-DO YOU EVER GET MAD?
-SURE, I DO.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.858
SOMETIMES, I GET MAD
BECAUSE THAT TINY SECOND
IN THE MORNING

14:18.988 --> 14:20.598
JUST CAN'T LAST ALL DAY.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.818
-DO YOU EVER GET MAD
AT ANYBODY YOU LOVE?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.821
-YOUR DAD GOT MAD
AT YOU, DIDN'T HE?

14:32.654 --> 14:34.699
I USED TO GET MAD AT MY MOM,

14:35.265 --> 14:38.312
BUT SHE KNEW IT DIDN'T MEAN
I DIDN'T LOVE HER
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.838
IT'S EASY TO GET MAD
AT SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU

14:42.969 --> 14:45.406
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THEY'LL ALWAYS FORGIVE YOU.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.673
I GOTTA GO, HOBIE.
SOPHIE WILL KILL ME
IF I'M LATE FOR THERAPY AGAIN.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.112
-BYE, JASON!
-BYE!

14:56.243 --> 14:57.635
-AND THANKS!

15:06.906 --> 15:09.691
-HOBIE'S OVER THERE.
-THANKS, JASON.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.451
HEY.

15:31.104 --> 15:35.499
LOOK, UH... I'M SORRY
THAT I LOST IT WITH YOU.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.589
IT'S JUST, UM...

15:39.721 --> 15:41.505
I'M HAVING A REALLY
HARD TIME WITH THIS,

15:42.680 --> 15:44.944
AND I'M TRYING REALLY HARD
TO BEAT IT,

15:45.074 --> 15:46.728
BUT SOMETIMES, I JUST...

15:46.858 --> 15:48.948
I JUST GET A LITTLE FRUSTRATED.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.559
UH...

15:54.257 --> 15:56.738
FORGIVE ME?
-I FORGIVE YOU, DAD.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.749
-YOU KNOW, I LOVE YOU, DON'T YA?
-I LOVE YOU, TOO.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.055
-OKAY.

16:14.451 --> 16:17.193
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO TEACH THOSE GUYS
HOW TO PLAY THAT GAME?

16:17.324 --> 16:20.240
-ALL RIGHT, GREAT!
-LET'S GO.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.070
-HEY, YOU GUYS, GOT ROOM
FOR TWO MORE PLAYERS?

16:36.604 --> 16:38.301
-ALL RIGHT!

16:40.738 --> 16:45.134
OKAY, HOBIE, GO.
HOBIE, OUTSIDE, OUTSIDE!
HOBIE! I GOT IT!

17:15.164 --> 17:16.905
-I HOPE YOU GIRLS HAD
A GREAT DAY.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.515
-SEE YA.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.998
-MATT, LET ME WORK
YOUR TOWER TOMORROW,
SO I CAN BE NEAR JIMMY.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.305
-HEY, IT'S FINE WITH ME
IF IT'S OKAY WITH STEPHANIE.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.046
-OKAY, THANKS. COME ON.

17:35.706 --> 17:39.058
-RADAR, WILL YOU GIVE THESE
TO NEWMAN? THEY'RE THE TOWER
ASSIGNMENTS FOR TOMORROW.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.363
-MM-HMM.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.715
-HEY, GUYS! OH, ROUGH DAY?

17:45.281 --> 17:47.066
-SEEMS LIKE NO ONE KNEW
HOW TO SWIM TODAY.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.981
I SPENT MORE TIME IN THE WATER
THAN IN MY TOWER.

17:50.895 --> 17:53.246
-UH, LISTEN, STEPHANIE,
MATT AND I WERE WONDERING

17:53.376 --> 17:54.986
IF WE COULD SWITCH
TOWERS TOMORROW.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.077
-SWITCH TOWERS? WHY?
-WHY?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.688
-BECAUSE, UM...

18:01.297 --> 18:03.734
I JUST WANTED
TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE
IN A DIFFERENT TOWER.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.260
-WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
GETTING A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE, MATT.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.349
-HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?

18:09.479 --> 18:11.351
-I HAVEN'T QUITE
FIGURED THAT OUT YET.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.749
-HEY, WASN'T THAT JIMMY
I SAW SURFING IN FRONT
OF YOUR TOWER TODAY?

18:21.230 --> 18:24.364
-I THINK SO.
-YOU THINK SO?

18:25.147 --> 18:28.846
A SURFER LIKE JIMMY SLADE
EITHER IS OR IS NOT SURFING
IN FRONT OF YOUR TOWER, MATT.

18:29.630 --> 18:30.805
THERE'S NO MISTAKING IT.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.460
WHAT IS A MISTAKE THOUGH,

18:33.590 --> 18:35.505
IS TO TRY AND GET A TOWER
TO BE NEAR YOUR BOYFRIEND.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.594
-YEAH? WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS DOING.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.727
