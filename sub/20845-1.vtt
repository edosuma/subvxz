00:00.279 --> 00:03.348
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.349 --> 00:05.149
Man, this girl still
ain't text me back.

00:05.150 --> 00:06.750
It's probably 'cause you're unemployed,

00:06.751 --> 00:08.085
you live with your ex-wife

00:08.086 --> 00:11.288
and you owe Bank of America $35,000.

00:12.157 --> 00:13.290
Jerrod, I told you.

00:13.291 --> 00:14.692
Stop being so honest with Bobby.

00:14.693 --> 00:16.160
He's not strong enough.

00:17.462 --> 00:21.398
Bobby, you beautiful.

00:21.399 --> 00:23.100
Bobby, just give her some time.

00:23.101 --> 00:24.535
I mean, the date was just last night.

00:24.536 --> 00:26.403
See, that's the problem
with technology.

00:26.404 --> 00:29.039
You sitting here waiting for
this woman to text you back.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.175
In my day, you just park
in front of a woman's house

00:31.176 --> 00:32.610
and you stay there.

00:33.912 --> 00:35.779
He did, he did that.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.083
Your daddy wouldn't leave for nothing.

00:39.084 --> 00:41.318
I'm glad you're back in
the dating game, Bobby.

00:41.319 --> 00:42.786
I wanted to win the divorce,

00:42.787 --> 00:44.955
but I never wanted it to be a shutout.

00:44.956 --> 00:46.257
I'm happy Bobby's dating, too.

00:46.258 --> 00:48.092
See, if Bobby's getting dates,

00:48.093 --> 00:51.028
that means if me and Maxine
ever break up, I'll be fine.

00:51.029 --> 00:52.262
Oh, my God.

00:52.931 --> 00:54.632
Maxine, calm down.

00:54.633 --> 00:57.167
I hardly ever think about
breaking up with you.

00:57.168 --> 00:59.703
No, no, I just read
that this girl, Sara,

00:59.704 --> 01:01.605
I used to work with was raped.

01:01.606 --> 01:04.742
Oh, wow. That was not
what I was expecting.

01:04.742 --> 01:05.876
Sorry to hear that, Maxine.

01:05.877 --> 01:07.645
Oh, that's just terrible.

01:07.646 --> 01:09.280
It happened last year.

01:09.281 --> 01:10.948
I guess she's just started
talking about it.

01:10.949 --> 01:12.016
Poor girl.

01:12.017 --> 01:13.417
Well, what happened to the guy?

01:13.418 --> 01:14.552
Nothing, apparently.

01:14.553 --> 01:16.320
It was his word versus hers.

01:16.321 --> 01:18.422
See, that happens way too often.

01:18.423 --> 01:21.191
She needs to take the justice
system into her own hands.

01:21.192 --> 01:24.361
This one time, this guy was
pulling this girl into an alley,

01:24.362 --> 01:26.764
and me and my cousins took
turns beating his face in.

01:26.765 --> 01:29.166
We took his shoes and everything.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.768
That ain't even enough.

01:30.769 --> 01:33.637
If I was in charge,
the punishment for rapers

01:33.638 --> 01:37.641
would be they'd be put in prison
and raped every single day.

01:37.642 --> 01:39.943
Then they'd be put
into the halfway house

01:39.945 --> 01:42.513
where they raped every other day.

01:42.514 --> 01:44.214
But they wouldn't get raped on holidays

01:44.215 --> 01:46.517
'cause, you know, this still America.

01:46.518 --> 01:50.754
It's crazy you haven't been
elected to office yet.

01:50.755 --> 01:52.095
Where are you reading all this?

01:53.091 --> 01:55.259
She posted on this Facebook
hashtag called #ltHappenedToMe.

01:55.260 --> 01:58.162
There are over 100,000 posts.

01:58.163 --> 02:00.197
Man, rape is the worst.

02:00.198 --> 02:04.134
Real brave stance you're
taking there, Bobby.

02:04.135 --> 02:06.503
Yeah, so, apparently,
Sara went to a party

02:06.504 --> 02:09.106
where she ran into a guy
she knew named Mark Henderson.

02:09.107 --> 02:10.640
They went back to his house

02:10.642 --> 02:12.476
where they were making out on his bed.

02:12.477 --> 02:14.211
She told him she wasn't
gonna have sex with him,

02:14.212 --> 02:16.046
she only wanted to make out,

02:16.047 --> 02:18.716
but before she realized it,
sex had started.

02:18.717 --> 02:20.417
Wow.

02:20.418 --> 02:22.753
Wait.

02:22.754 --> 02:24.955
I-I missed the part about the rape.

02:24.956 --> 02:27.524
Did you switch to a different story?

02:27.525 --> 02:28.859
No, that's the story.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.628
She didn't give consent. That's rape.

02:30.629 --> 02:34.498
Well, maybe I'm unclear
as to the definition.

02:34.499 --> 02:37.635
What's the one where they
drag somebody into a alley

02:37.636 --> 02:40.404
- and they force themselves on them?
- Rape.

02:40.405 --> 02:43.173
That's the one I was thinking of.

02:43.174 --> 02:47.511
Look, this is clearly
a very delicate subject

02:47.512 --> 02:49.713
and pretty scary stuff.

02:49.714 --> 02:51.348
Yeah, it's terrifying.

02:51.349 --> 02:53.150
If we just jump to conclusions,

02:53.151 --> 02:55.619
a rape accusation can
really ruin a man's life.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.054
Are you kidding me?

02:57.055 --> 02:58.122
You're worried about the man?

02:58.123 --> 02:59.957
Someone has to be, Maxine.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.859
I mean, we just heard
about this Mark Henderson guy

03:01.860 --> 03:03.460
and we were all ready to kill him,

03:03.461 --> 03:05.863
and then after a few more
details of the story came out,

03:05.864 --> 03:08.032
we're not necessarily sure
if he did anything wrong.

03:08.033 --> 03:09.466
Like, nothing about that bothers you?

03:09.467 --> 03:11.268
No, we do know that
he did something wrong.

03:11.269 --> 03:13.037
Sara didn't give him consent.

03:13.038 --> 03:14.371
That's assault.

03:14.372 --> 03:16.206
Well, that's her version of the story.

03:16.207 --> 03:17.274
We don't know his version.

03:17.275 --> 03:18.709
Okay, well, Sara is one

03:18.710 --> 03:19.810
of the most reliable
people that I know.

03:19.811 --> 03:21.578
Oh, my bad. I didn't know

03:21.579 --> 03:24.181
she was one of the most
reliable people you know.

03:24.182 --> 03:26.183
Oh, in that case, let's lock him up.

03:26.184 --> 03:29.486
Let's send him to Dad's rape prison.

03:29.487 --> 03:30.888
Look, this is exactly why

03:30.889 --> 03:32.823
you should get
a verbal yes for consent.

03:32.824 --> 03:33.891
Then there are no questions.

03:33.892 --> 03:35.426
"A verbal yes"?

03:35.427 --> 03:36.960
That's not the rules for sex.

03:36.961 --> 03:40.030
That's the rules for
emergency exit row seating.

03:40.031 --> 03:44.535
No, a woman should
never say yes verbally.

03:44.536 --> 03:48.472
I mean, if a man wants sex and
a woman says, "Yes," out loud,

03:48.473 --> 03:51.508
well, that just makes her
a dirty whore.

03:53.545 --> 03:55.112
I don't know.

03:55.113 --> 03:56.647
I think I'm with Jerrod on this one.

03:56.648 --> 03:58.449
I mean, it's confusing, Maxine.

03:58.450 --> 04:02.219
What if you meet a woman who has
a rape fantasy and she says,

04:02.220 --> 04:05.155
"No matter how many times
I say no, keep on going."

04:05.156 --> 04:06.724
Now, how do you know
if you've gone too far

04:06.725 --> 04:10.294
or if you just making
a woman's dreams come true?

04:10.295 --> 04:14.098
Well, if you guys have decided
to role-play a rape fantasy,

04:14.099 --> 04:17.201
then that is consent and a safe
word should be established.

04:17.202 --> 04:19.136
Mike Pence.

04:19.137 --> 04:20.571
That's my safe word.

04:20.572 --> 04:22.039
If you hear "Mike Pence,"

04:22.040 --> 04:24.808
you've gone too far for Nekeisha.

04:26.277 --> 04:29.747
Well, uh, now, what if both
of y'all are so drunk

04:29.748 --> 04:32.115
you in no condition to give consent?

04:32.117 --> 04:34.318
Does that mean you raped each other?

04:34.319 --> 04:35.819
Okay, how about this?

04:35.820 --> 04:39.156
What if I fall asleep
in a short skirt on a bus?

04:39.157 --> 04:40.858
Should someone be allowed
to have sex with me

04:40.859 --> 04:42.125
while I'm passed out?

04:42.127 --> 04:43.160
Well of course not, but-but, see...

04:43.161 --> 04:44.828
Okay, so what if I was drunk?

04:44.829 --> 04:46.964
Should someone be allowed
to do whatever they want?

04:46.965 --> 04:47.965
No, but...

04:47.966 --> 04:49.600
Okay, so in a perfect world,

04:49.601 --> 04:52.703
a woman should be able
to be black-out drunk,

04:52.704 --> 04:54.371
break into someone's house,

04:54.372 --> 04:55.973
pass out, and still not have to worry

04:55.974 --> 04:57.508
about being sexually assaulted.

04:57.509 --> 05:00.010
What are you doing drunk
on the bus, Maxine?

05:00.011 --> 05:01.612
I'm just saying

05:01.613 --> 05:04.214
that it shouldn't all be
on women to stay safe.

05:04.215 --> 05:06.450
We should be teaching
our sons not to rape,

05:06.451 --> 05:09.486
to get a verbal yes
every step of the way.

05:09.487 --> 05:11.388
All right.

05:11.389 --> 05:17.060
So, if a guy had a drunk hookup
with a girl last night,

05:17.061 --> 05:22.266
and he doesn't remember
verbally getting a yes,

05:22.267 --> 05:24.535
could that guy be a raper?

05:24.536 --> 05:26.436
Yes. Thank you, Bobby.

05:26.437 --> 05:28.972
Finally, someone understands
what I'm saying.

05:34.546 --> 05:36.280
Oh, Lord.

05:36.281 --> 05:38.015
What's wrong, Bobby?

05:38.016 --> 05:42.152
Mama, I might be a raper.

05:42.153 --> 05:45.355
Oh, sweet shepherd of Jesus!

05:45.356 --> 05:46.924
You a raper?!

05:46.925 --> 05:49.860
Bobby, I didn't raise you
to be no raper.

05:51.095 --> 05:52.796
Hold on, everybody.

05:52.797 --> 05:55.065
Before we go any further,

05:55.066 --> 05:58.669
the correct word is rapist.

06:06.662 --> 06:12.762
<font color="#FFDF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by</font>
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

06:14.143 --> 06:16.265
Oh, my God. Am I a monster?

06:16.266 --> 06:20.396
Bobby, look me in my
eyes and be honest.

06:20.397 --> 06:22.498
Did you rape that girl?

06:22.499 --> 06:24.200
I don't think so.

06:24.201 --> 06:26.169
I believe you.

06:26.170 --> 06:29.939
Come on, y'all, everything's okay.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.941
But I don't know for sure.

06:31.942 --> 06:34.244
Bobby, what makes you think
this is even possible?

06:34.245 --> 06:36.279
Look, I wouldn't
intentionally hurt a woman,

06:36.280 --> 06:39.816
and I always go with no means no,

06:39.817 --> 06:41.751
but I've never thought of consent

06:41.752 --> 06:42.752
the way you talk about it.

06:42.753 --> 06:44.087
Bobby.

06:44.088 --> 06:45.188
What are you talking about?

06:45.189 --> 06:47.056
You didn't do anything wrong.

06:47.057 --> 06:49.626
At any point during the night,
did she ever say no to sex?

06:49.627 --> 06:51.494
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait, what?

06:52.663 --> 06:54.530
- But it wasn't during sex.
- Oh.

06:54.531 --> 06:56.933
You know, she-she did that
thing that girls do, you know,

06:56.934 --> 06:59.535
before the start of a date,
where they let you know

06:59.536 --> 07:01.271
that they're definitely not
having sex with you tonight.

07:01.272 --> 07:03.773
They still doing that?

07:06.477 --> 07:09.212
So how did you two
end up sleeping together?

07:09.213 --> 07:10.780
Well, I mean, we had a few drinks,

07:10.781 --> 07:12.382
you know, and dinner was fun.

07:12.383 --> 07:14.183
And I went to put her in an Uber,

07:14.184 --> 07:16.019
and she was like, "I'm not tired,"

07:16.020 --> 07:18.554
so she said she'll come back
to my place and watch a movie.

07:18.555 --> 07:20.757
Oh, she said she was gonna
come back to your place

07:20.758 --> 07:23.526
to watch a movie, well,
there's consent right there.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.395
- You think so?
- No!

07:25.396 --> 07:30.500
Come on, Maxine, just let
my son not be a rapist.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.502
I'm not saying that
he did anything wrong.

07:32.503 --> 07:34.170
And he's the one questioning himself.

07:34.171 --> 07:35.938
And I actually think
that it's pretty admirable

07:35.939 --> 07:37.707
that he even cares to try and see this

07:37.708 --> 07:39.342
from the woman's point of view.

07:39.343 --> 07:42.812
I just never thought I'd need
to hear the word "yes."

07:42.813 --> 07:47.684
I mean, at one point I thought
she yelled out, "Don't stop."

07:47.685 --> 07:50.620
Or maybe it was just, "Don't.

07:50.621 --> 07:52.321
Stop!"

07:54.124 --> 07:58.961
Son, that's a very important pause.

07:58.962 --> 08:01.931
Well, have you, have you talked to her?

08:01.932 --> 08:04.967
No, she hasn't answered
any of my texts.

08:04.968 --> 08:06.936
Oh, man, you don't think that's why?

08:06.937 --> 08:09.705
Rape or no rape, I think it's
rude not to return a text.

08:11.608 --> 08:14.410
Two wrongs don't make a right.

08:14.411 --> 08:18.481
Bobby, there's no way you did anything.

08:18.482 --> 08:21.217
You're not a rapist,
you're a sweet guy,

08:21.218 --> 08:23.152
You're caring, and considerate,

08:23.153 --> 08:24.887
and you got asthma,

08:24.888 --> 08:27.690
and you can't see without your glasses.

08:27.691 --> 08:30.526
- You can't keep a secret.
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.527 --> 08:33.328
And you got no grip.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.164
Almost any woman could
get away from you

08:35.164 --> 08:36.664
'cause you got these weak-ass arms.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.538
Thanks, guys.

08:42.539 --> 08:46.109
I really appreciate that,
but Maxine's new rules

08:46.110 --> 08:48.378
on consent really got me thinking.

08:48.379 --> 08:51.381
You know, asking men to
treat women with respect

08:51.382 --> 08:53.383
isn't some new rule that I made up.

08:53.384 --> 08:55.318
Well, I had never heard of it before.

08:58.021 --> 09:00.990
I'm just saying that there
should never be any doubt.

09:00.991 --> 09:03.893
You should get clear consent
and hear her say "yes."

09:03.894 --> 09:05.061
I don't know.

09:05.062 --> 09:06.662
Not letting any of these men touch us

09:06.663 --> 09:07.964
until we get a verbal "yes,"

09:07.965 --> 09:09.699
could take some of the fun out of sex.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.668
I don't want to share too much,

09:12.669 --> 09:14.937
but I like to get choked
and pinned down sometimes.

09:19.443 --> 09:22.044
Nekeisha, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

09:22.045 --> 09:23.579
but you already told us that.

09:26.283 --> 09:29.352
But let's not pretend that
you and I ask for permission

09:29.353 --> 09:31.020
every step of the way.

09:31.021 --> 09:33.556
Yeah, that's because there's
no surprises with you,

09:33.557 --> 09:36.926
you do the same thing in the
same order every single time.

09:38.362 --> 09:39.595
Maxine,

09:39.596 --> 09:41.197
have a little class, okay?

09:41.198 --> 09:42.865
We're in front of my family.

09:42.866 --> 09:44.567
Let's stay on the subject.

09:44.568 --> 09:47.537
We're talking about rape.

09:47.538 --> 09:51.107
Uh, I know this is an awkward
time to to say this,

09:51.108 --> 09:54.277
but I ordered an Uber before
this conversation even started,

09:54.278 --> 09:56.579
and if I don't leave now
I'm gonna have to pay for it,

09:56.580 --> 09:58.948
so I'm out.

09:58.949 --> 10:01.083
God, I can't believe
she hasn't answered my texts.

10:01.084 --> 10:03.386
Bobby, you're really
overthinking this whole thing.

10:03.387 --> 10:05.154
Why are you saying that
he's overthinking this?

10:05.155 --> 10:07.056
Maybe a little caution
when it comes to sex

10:07.057 --> 10:08.357
would be a good thing.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.860
It would be great if men
had to think about rape

10:10.861 --> 10:12.261
as much as women do.

10:12.262 --> 10:13.429
Maxine, are you kidding me?

10:13.430 --> 10:14.831
When I was single, I thought about

10:14.832 --> 10:16.299
rape accusations constantly.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.800
That's why I was so nice
to girls all the time.

10:17.801 --> 10:19.168
Opening doors and stuff.

10:19.169 --> 10:21.370
Really, that's all chivalry
is, it's just a man

10:21.371 --> 10:24.106
trying to show a woman
how much he's not a rapist.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.110
I read somewhere that Justin Bieber

10:28.111 --> 10:31.948
makes everybody he sleeps
with sign a consent waiver.

10:31.949 --> 10:33.549
That is so sad,

10:33.550 --> 10:35.151
a young pop star can't even enjoy

10:35.152 --> 10:38.821
a gratuitous amount
of casual sex anymore.

10:40.090 --> 10:42.658
Man, I should've got her
to sign something?

10:42.659 --> 10:45.995
I don't even have a printer.

10:45.996 --> 10:48.531
I mean, it's not a bad idea.

10:48.532 --> 10:50.867
Really, being falsely accused of rape

10:50.868 --> 10:52.835
is as bad as being raped.

10:52.836 --> 10:55.338
What? How could you possibly
say a dumb thing like that?

10:55.339 --> 10:57.440
You can't compare being accused
to being mentally

10:57.441 --> 11:00.176
- and physically assaulted, Jerrod.
- True, true.

11:00.177 --> 11:02.645
But if you're accused,
your life is over.

11:02.646 --> 11:05.414
Yeah, ever since I accused myself,

11:05.415 --> 11:08.084
I've been devastated.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.620
That is not true, Jerrod.

11:10.621 --> 11:13.990
Um, Kobe Bryant,
Nate Parker, Ben Roethlisberger.

11:13.991 --> 11:16.259
None of their careers
have been affected.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.461
Roman Polanski, Julian Assange.

11:18.462 --> 11:19.829
CeeLo Green.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.297
Yeah, okay.

11:21.298 --> 11:24.233
Sure, but those accusations
will follow them

11:24.234 --> 11:25.434
for the rest of their lives

11:25.435 --> 11:27.503
because rape is the worst crime.

11:27.504 --> 11:29.805
Well, what about murder?

11:29.806 --> 11:32.441
That's pretty bad
when you think about it.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.244
Sure, but murder can be justified,

11:35.245 --> 11:37.647
or even celebrated
in a certain context.

11:37.648 --> 11:40.216
There's never been a movie
where the terrorists surrender

11:40.217 --> 11:42.985
and the audience cheers because
Mark Wahlberg raped the bad guys

11:42.986 --> 11:44.754
just in the nick of time.

11:46.056 --> 11:48.524
Jerrod, a man who bragged about

11:48.525 --> 11:50.726
sexually assaulting women,
and then dismissed it

11:50.727 --> 11:52.194
as "locker room talk"

11:52.195 --> 11:54.530
was elected as the president
of the United States.

11:54.531 --> 11:55.898
Clearly we don't
take it seriously enough.

11:55.899 --> 11:57.333
Damn.

11:57.334 --> 11:59.569
You can brag about sexual assault

11:59.570 --> 12:01.003
and become president.

12:01.004 --> 12:03.906
I don't know if I should
be horrified or inspired.

12:05.776 --> 12:07.577
Everybody, that's enough.

12:07.578 --> 12:08.844
Now, we have done nothing

12:08.845 --> 12:11.213
but talk about rape,
rape, rape, rape, rape.

12:12.316 --> 12:15.184
Who wants ice cream?

12:15.185 --> 12:17.620
You know what, Maxine, my mom is right.

12:17.621 --> 12:19.288
Let's just drop it, all right?

12:19.289 --> 12:20.423
I'll make you a sundae.

12:20.424 --> 12:22.058
Oh, thank you.

12:22.059 --> 12:25.227
Uh, do you want one scoop or two?

12:25.228 --> 12:26.228
One.

12:26.229 --> 12:27.496
Okay, 'cause I know, like,

12:27.497 --> 12:29.065
usually you want one,
but occasionally two,

12:29.066 --> 12:31.667
and I just want to be sure
before I do anything.

12:33.403 --> 12:34.604
One.

12:34.605 --> 12:37.273
Okay. Oh, Maxine, sprinkles?

12:37.274 --> 12:38.407
Mm-hmm.

12:38.408 --> 12:39.875
I'm-I'm sorry, is that a yes?

12:39.876 --> 12:42.545
'Cause I need to hear a verbal "yes."

12:42.546 --> 12:44.313
I-I don't want to make any assumptions

12:44.314 --> 12:46.282
about what you want going in your body.

12:46.283 --> 12:47.950
Are you really mocking me right now?

12:47.951 --> 12:49.652
Yeah, Jerrod. Are you
trying to mock us?

12:49.653 --> 12:51.954
- This is serious.
- No.

12:51.955 --> 12:54.256
No, no, I'm just doing
what you said, Maxine.

12:54.257 --> 12:55.825
Making things crystal clear.

12:55.826 --> 12:58.094
Okay, you know, you're
worried about accusations,

12:58.095 --> 13:00.763
Bobby's worried that he may have
accidentally assaulted somebody.

13:00.764 --> 13:02.465
You know how you fix all that?

13:02.466 --> 13:04.066
You communicate with your partner.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.034
It's very simple.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.169
Watch. You are a dick.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.171
I'm taking the car. Good night.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.888
I think we all have
to give her that one.

13:21.393 --> 13:23.697
Bobby, I hate to see you like this.

13:23.698 --> 13:26.365
You hardly even touched
your ice cream. Are you okay?

13:26.366 --> 13:29.806
No, I'm trying to put together
the pieces from last night.

13:29.807 --> 13:32.275
We were both so drunk.

13:32.276 --> 13:35.278
And I remember that she hurried
off at the end of the night.

13:35.279 --> 13:38.348
And she still hasn't
answered any of my texts.

13:38.349 --> 13:40.083
Well, did you check her social media?

13:40.084 --> 13:42.552
Yeah, she hasn't posted all day.

13:42.553 --> 13:44.654
Well, that's not normal.
I mean, even I posted

13:44.655 --> 13:47.223
a picture of the ice cream on Facebook.

13:49.126 --> 13:50.293
You got to...

13:50.294 --> 13:52.662
you got to read
what I wrote about it. I said,

13:52.663 --> 13:55.332
"Coolin' out with my family."

13:55.333 --> 13:59.002
Oh, Joe, that's so clever.

13:59.003 --> 14:01.271
T-Tag me in that so Sylvia can see

14:01.272 --> 14:03.740
how much fun we're having over here.

14:03.741 --> 14:07.343
Uh-oh.

14:07.345 --> 14:08.311
Oh, did she post something?

14:08.312 --> 14:09.980
Yep.

14:09.981 --> 14:12.082
"Trying to forget about
last night, but I can't.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.017
Need good energy right now."

14:16.020 --> 14:18.221
I got to talk to her.

14:18.222 --> 14:20.190
Bobby.

14:20.191 --> 14:22.592
Bobby, what are you doing?

14:22.593 --> 14:24.227
You're-you're gonna go find
this girl and ask her what?

14:24.228 --> 14:26.096
I don't know. I just need answers.

14:26.097 --> 14:28.498
Son, you gonna show up at this
woman's house unannounced

14:28.499 --> 14:29.899
and ask her if you raped her?

14:29.900 --> 14:33.003
Are you trying to get
a restraining order?

14:33.004 --> 14:35.772
Look, Dad, she's clearly
upset about something.

14:35.773 --> 14:38.541
I need to make sure I didn't
do anything to hurt this girl.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.543
Bobby, I know how you were raised.

14:40.544 --> 14:41.945
You are a sweet boy.

14:41.946 --> 14:44.647
You wouldn't even rape a fly.

14:44.648 --> 14:46.483
Now, come on, don't do this.

14:46.484 --> 14:49.252
But Mama, you always told me
to own up to my mistakes.

14:49.253 --> 14:51.187
Bobby, if you go over there,

14:51.188 --> 14:53.490
you're gonna be asking
her a very real question

14:53.491 --> 14:56.493
and you have to be ready
for a very real answer.

14:56.494 --> 14:59.262
I know, and-and whatever she says,

14:59.263 --> 15:01.264
at least my conscience will be clear

15:01.265 --> 15:03.266
and I've owned up to whatever I did.

15:03.267 --> 15:05.168
Now, the only thing worse
than being the type of guy

15:05.169 --> 15:06.903
that does something like this

15:06.904 --> 15:09.205
is being the guy that
tries to get away with it.

15:09.206 --> 15:13.042
All right, man, if you feel that way,

15:13.044 --> 15:15.445
then maybe you should go.

15:15.446 --> 15:17.881
Thanks, Jerrod.

15:17.882 --> 15:19.315
Come on, let's go to your place.

15:19.316 --> 15:23.086
But wait-wait, w-why my place?

15:23.087 --> 15:24.754
She lives in your building.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.389
You...

15:26.390 --> 15:29.592
you maybe raped my neighbor?

15:29.593 --> 15:32.195
I mean, Jerrod, where am I
supposed to go to meet girls at?

15:32.196 --> 15:34.497
Okay? I'm always here or at your place.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.266
Come on, Jerrod.

15:36.267 --> 15:38.001
I can't do this by myself.

15:40.838 --> 15:42.872
I'm nervous.

15:42.873 --> 15:44.507
You know, we don't have to do this.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.909
No, man, I'm ready, you know?

15:45.910 --> 15:47.610
Let's just go up there and talk...

15:47.611 --> 15:50.780
oh, God, she's coming. I'm not ready.

15:50.781 --> 15:52.715
Hi.

15:52.716 --> 15:54.551
Bobby?

15:57.955 --> 15:59.322
H-hey, Natalie.

15:59.323 --> 16:00.823
What are you doing here?

16:00.825 --> 16:05.562
Well, um, Natalie, I mean, um...

16:08.299 --> 16:11.134
I'm sorry I raped you.

16:12.937 --> 16:15.438
Hey, I'm Jerrod.

16:15.439 --> 16:19.442
I'm just here to make sure
everybody feels safe.

16:19.443 --> 16:21.111
What are you talking about?

16:21.112 --> 16:23.279
Well, last night, you said
you didn't want to have sex,

16:23.280 --> 16:27.016
and then we did,
but did I ever get a verbal yes?

16:27.017 --> 16:28.318
No.

16:28.319 --> 16:31.254
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this,

16:31.255 --> 16:33.356
it means I raped you.

16:33.357 --> 16:37.260
Bobby, you did not.

16:37.261 --> 16:38.828
Yes, I did.

16:38.829 --> 16:41.397
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

16:41.398 --> 16:44.934
Bobby, what are you
trying to talk her into?

16:44.935 --> 16:46.836
Did you really come down here
with another guy

16:46.837 --> 16:49.639
to explain to a woman what rape is?

16:49.640 --> 16:53.076
Well, it sounds bad when
you say it like that.

16:53.077 --> 16:56.913
Bobby, I wanted to sleep with you.

16:56.914 --> 16:58.581
Yes!

16:58.582 --> 17:01.584
Yes, yes, yes!

17:03.420 --> 17:05.887
So, how do you like the building?

17:08.325 --> 17:10.693
You know something, Natalie?
You know, next time,

17:10.694 --> 17:12.929
we just got to do a better job
at communicating.

17:12.930 --> 17:16.933
Bobby, I don't think
there's gonna be a next time.

17:16.934 --> 17:21.069
Wait, what? How-how come?

17:21.070 --> 17:24.207
I can think of a couple reasons.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.742
Look, Bobby, it was a fine date,

17:25.742 --> 17:27.644
but I just don't think we connected.

17:27.645 --> 17:28.945
What are you talking about?

17:28.946 --> 17:30.313
We got so much in common.

17:30.314 --> 17:33.550
No, I don't mean that. I just mean...

17:33.551 --> 17:34.684
What?

17:34.685 --> 17:39.289
Physically, it was... you know?

17:42.993 --> 17:46.963
Nah.

17:46.964 --> 17:49.866
I don't think I do know, nah.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.068
Bobby, don't...

17:52.069 --> 17:53.903
What are you trying to say?

17:53.904 --> 17:57.740
Bobby, the sex was bad, all right?

17:59.543 --> 18:03.479
Oh, okay. You know, that's what's up.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.882
Yeah. Sorry.

18:09.019 --> 18:10.553
And the tweet earlier?

18:10.554 --> 18:14.524
I was ashamed.

18:14.525 --> 18:18.995
Okeydoke. You know...

18:18.996 --> 18:22.732
I mean, I'm not a rapist.

18:22.733 --> 18:26.502
But I'm bad at sex.

18:26.503 --> 18:29.939
This moment is really bittersweet.

18:31.842 --> 18:33.776
Natalie, one last question.

18:33.777 --> 18:36.246
What exactly about the sex was bad?

18:36.247 --> 18:40.116
Well, I just don't think you
were aggressive enough.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.787
Huh.

18:47.558 --> 18:50.360
Jerrod, it is impossible

18:50.361 --> 18:54.464
to describe how I'm feeling right now.

18:56.000 --> 19:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:03.374 --> 19:05.775
You don't have to pretend
to be asleep, Maxine.

19:05.776 --> 19:07.176
You were right about consent.

19:07.177 --> 19:10.213
I'm awake.

19:10.214 --> 19:12.048
I just watched

19:12.049 --> 19:14.817
a man try and tell a
woman that he raped her

19:14.818 --> 19:17.086
and her response was, "No, you didn't.

19:17.087 --> 19:19.155
You're just bad at sex."

19:19.156 --> 19:22.191
So, if the choice is to
communicate before or after,

19:22.192 --> 19:23.860
before is definitely the way to go.

19:23.861 --> 19:25.695
Well, thank you for acknowledging that.

19:25.696 --> 19:27.730
That is all I wanted.

19:27.731 --> 19:28.931
But I can't believe you guys

19:28.932 --> 19:30.800
actually let Bobby go over there.

19:30.801 --> 19:34.537
He showed up at a woman's house
and asked if he raped her?

19:34.538 --> 19:35.938
Was he trying to get
a restraining order?

19:35.939 --> 19:37.740
Oh, he tried his hardest.

19:37.741 --> 19:41.010
Also, the girl lives in our building,

19:41.011 --> 19:43.212
- so we might have to move.
- What?

19:43.213 --> 19:45.782
So... we good?

19:45.783 --> 19:47.283
Yeah, we're good.

19:47.284 --> 19:52.789
Cool. Um, may I...

19:52.790 --> 19:54.757
lie next to you?

19:54.758 --> 19:58.127
Yes.

19:58.128 --> 20:00.963
May I kiss you?

20:00.964 --> 20:04.233
Yes.

20:04.234 --> 20:06.369
Left hand, right thigh?

20:06.370 --> 20:08.104
Come on.

20:08.105 --> 20:09.572
Get under the covers.

20:09.573 --> 20:11.007
Consensual sex is fun.

20:11.008 --> 20:12.075
It's kind of like playing Twister.

20:14.078 --> 20:16.012
Hey, maybe tonight's
the night we finally...

20:16.013 --> 20:17.447
Mike Pence.

20:17.448 --> 20:19.949
Okay, that's why we ask.

20:21.410 --> 20:23.497
Well, I'm relieved to hear that, Bobby.

20:23.498 --> 20:25.883
But why didn't she answer
your text messages?

20:25.884 --> 20:28.253
She was afraid of how
attached she was getting.

20:28.254 --> 20:30.654
Matter of fact, she said, and I quote,

20:30.655 --> 20:32.990
"Bobby, you've made me feel

20:32.991 --> 20:35.059
"like no man's ever
made me feel before.

20:36.328 --> 20:40.698
"I almost got your name
tattooed on my shoulder.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.666
"And that's why we can never be

20:42.667 --> 20:46.170
because I can't handle the emotions."

20:46.171 --> 20:48.038
She said all of that?

20:48.039 --> 20:51.175
Yep. Word for word, Mama.

20:51.176 --> 20:53.177
Good news.

20:53.178 --> 20:54.545
Bobby, you didn't rape her.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.547
I got a friend that knows Natalie

20:56.548 --> 20:59.083
and she said you're just bad at sex.
