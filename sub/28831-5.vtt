WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:04.000
(lively chatter, laughter)

00:05.500 --> 00:08.119
You either need to break up
with Raj or take him
off your team.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.330
Mariana:
I'm gonna miss
working with you so much.

00:10.330 --> 00:13.120
And, hey, I don't want you
to worry about Evan.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.920
If he ever crossed
a line,

00:14.920 --> 00:16.540
trust that I would
shoot it down right away.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.120
So, I was wondering if you
would like to get a drink
with me sometime.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.080
To talk next steps
on the app.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.750
-Sure. When?
-How about now?

00:24.750 --> 00:28.620
-Oh, my God,
we loved your set!
-Yeah, you're hysterical.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.710
Look, I don't have to go
to the queer comedy night.

00:30.710 --> 00:32.080
Yes, you do.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.620
So, you're not
breaking up with me?

00:33.620 --> 00:35.000
No.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.330
'Cause I'm falling
in love with you.

00:37.710 --> 00:39.250
Gael: I haven't had
the chance to thank you

00:39.250 --> 00:41.040
for making her dress.
It's stunning.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.250
This is Callie.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.540
She's our new
research assistant.

00:43.540 --> 00:44.790
Oh, good.

00:44.790 --> 00:46.170
You served
a demand letter?

00:46.170 --> 00:48.120
That's what
you said we do.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.120
We, as in one
of the licensed lawyers.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.670
I don't expect you
to invite me

00:51.670 --> 00:53.170
to every party
at The Coterie.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.710
Because I didn't want
to flaunt my choice

00:55.710 --> 00:57.460
in front of Gael
at his sister's party.

00:57.460 --> 00:58.830
So, I'm your choice?

00:58.830 --> 01:00.330
-Yes.
-In that case,

01:00.330 --> 01:02.040
all is forgiven.

01:05.580 --> 01:09.880
-(muffled laughter)
-(comedian speaking
indistinctly)

01:09.880 --> 01:12.170
Oh. Oh, my God.
Look at that jacket.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.330
It is a travesty
that a cow had to die

01:14.330 --> 01:16.330
for you to look
almost all right.

01:16.330 --> 01:17.920
Audience: Ooh!

01:17.920 --> 01:19.420
(laughter, scattered applause)

01:24.290 --> 01:26.290
Mariana:
So, the next steps
on the app.

01:29.330 --> 01:32.620
Evan:
I wanted to talk to you
about something personal.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.120
(echoing): What kind of law
do you practice?

01:36.920 --> 01:40.460
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

01:44.880 --> 01:47.750
Callie:
But this remodel
has been so stressful.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.330
I really need
a vacation.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.380
 Pa-pa-pa,
pa-pa-pa,
pa-pa

01:55.380 --> 01:58.620
 Pa-pa-pa,
pa-pa-pa, pa-pa

01:59.670 --> 02:03.210
 And then we'll find
our peace of mind

02:04.040 --> 02:06.210
 You and me, bel ami

02:06.210 --> 02:11.500
 Pa-pa-pa, pa-pa

02:16.210 --> 02:18.330
Why do you have
to go back to the Blue Team?

02:18.330 --> 02:20.170
They never replaced me.

02:21.290 --> 02:22.710
Alex:
Did you mean
to write "pubic static"?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.210
-It should be "public."
-Sam: No, no, no. Public.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.670
-Public.
-Alex: It's what--

02:25.670 --> 02:29.540
Ah! Look who's back
from the vaganerian.

02:30.460 --> 02:31.460
How did the neutering go?

02:31.460 --> 02:33.330
Is it itchy? Do you need
a cone of shame?

02:33.330 --> 02:35.290
The least she could have done
is let him keep his balls.

02:35.290 --> 02:37.120
Sam: Right? Like in a jar
or something.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.380
-I feel so bad.
-Raj: It's okay.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.710
I'll survive.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.960
Hey, so what happened
with Raj?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.210
Well, you know
what to say.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.120
Well, the plan
was always...

02:50.120 --> 02:52.290
for me to work
on the back end and once...

02:52.290 --> 02:53.380
the beta test
was successful,

02:53.380 --> 02:54.420
bring Claire in...

02:54.420 --> 02:55.790
to work on
the front end.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.670
-Sam: Mm.
-So, she just wanted you
for your back end.

03:02.670 --> 03:04.620
Baby got back... end.

03:04.620 --> 03:07.920
But clearly, the front
was not impressive.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.960
Sam:
No, I'm not impressed, at all.

03:15.290 --> 03:16.750
What was that for?

03:16.750 --> 03:17.880
For being amazing.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.620
So, uh, how late did you
end up working last night?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.330
(car honks)

03:24.330 --> 03:25.420
Not that late.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.380
So, next steps
on the app.

03:28.380 --> 03:30.290
Actually, that's not
why I asked you

03:30.290 --> 03:31.250
to have drinks with me.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.670
I wanted
to talk to you

03:32.670 --> 03:34.040
about something
more personal.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.500
Oh.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.000
I wanted to talk
to you about...

03:39.960 --> 03:40.960
dating.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.000
Cary: All these student
loan lenders

03:44.000 --> 03:45.620
are predatory,
if you ask me.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.750
And what about
the colleges?

03:46.750 --> 03:48.540
Tuition has doubled
over the past three decades.

03:48.540 --> 03:49.330
But salaries haven't.

03:49.710 --> 03:52.380
Which is why I can't afford
to go to grad school.

03:52.380 --> 03:55.330
I still owe $65,000
as it is.

03:55.330 --> 03:57.460
But hopefully,
I'll find a rich husband.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.790
Sixty-five K? Oof.
Mine is half that.

04:00.790 --> 04:03.420
What's a law degree
setting you back
these days?

04:03.420 --> 04:05.790
-You don't want to know.
-Come on, Marcus.

04:05.790 --> 04:06.960
We're all friends here.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.540
One-ten-ish?

04:08.540 --> 04:09.580
-Wow.
-Yikes.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.080
And that was
a couple of years ago.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.460
What about you?
What are you carrying?

04:15.420 --> 04:17.079
Or did you have
your college paid for?

04:18.290 --> 04:19.880
Like, he thinks

04:19.880 --> 04:22.040
I'm some entitled
rich girl

04:22.040 --> 04:23.670
who's never had to work
for anything.

04:23.670 --> 04:27.000
-He doesn't know me.
-So, set him straight.

04:28.540 --> 04:29.830
No, I shouldn't have
to play

04:29.830 --> 04:32.290
the foster kid card
just to get him to stop
judging me.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.250
Actually, I was
a foster kid.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.880
And when I eventually met
my biological father,

04:38.880 --> 04:41.670
he insisted on setting up
a college fund for me. So...

04:41.670 --> 04:44.330
Well, I think
that's great!

04:44.330 --> 04:45.620
Yeah, you're fortunate
to start your career

04:45.620 --> 04:47.580
with such a big leg up.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.420
I'm sure once you actually
pass the bar,

04:49.420 --> 04:50.920
you'll have lots
of opportunities.

04:52.580 --> 04:55.330
Do you know who else didn't
pass the bar the first time?

04:55.330 --> 04:57.750
Jerry Brown, Michelle Obama,
Hillary Clinton, and FDR.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.830
They all ended up having
pretty solid careers.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.330
I can't believe I was
so full of myself.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.380
Quitting my clerkship,

05:04.380 --> 05:06.380
thinking I was going to get
a job at the ACLU.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.170
Now I'm a research assistant,
making half of what I was.

05:11.170 --> 05:15.120
Meanwhile, Mariana's stuck
paying two-thirds of our rent,

05:16.170 --> 05:18.040
and she has her own
student loans to pay.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.080
 Been lost, been found

05:20.080 --> 05:22.620
 Bound with temptation

05:22.620 --> 05:24.500
I haven't gotten
the job yet.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.120
I'm pretty sure
I'm going to get it.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.290
 I've been uptight,
you got me right

05:30.290 --> 05:32.750
 I'm back into my groove

05:32.750 --> 05:35.380
 Keep it pumping
give me something

05:35.380 --> 05:36.830
 That I could get used to...

05:36.830 --> 05:38.880
I could always help out.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.750
No. No. No, no, no.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.540
So, that's a no?

05:44.330 --> 05:46.040
No, you have always been

05:46.040 --> 05:47.710
beyond supportive of me.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.920
In fact,

05:49.920 --> 05:52.920
what can I do for you,
for once?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.710
Besides...
get naked?

06:00.120 --> 06:02.710
You can come with me to this
partner's event this weekend.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.500
I'm one of the only
junior lawyers invited.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.750
-It's kind of a big deal.
-I'm there.

06:08.670 --> 06:09.580
Nice.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.040
-Wait, when is it?
-Saturday.

06:12.670 --> 06:13.830
This Saturday?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.500
Teresa: Don't forget
we're working Saturday.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.210
We work one
a month for clients

06:19.210 --> 06:20.420
who can't get here
during the week.

06:20.420 --> 06:22.790
-All of us?
-Yes. All of us.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
Knock, knock.

06:37.830 --> 06:38.750
(knocking on door)

06:40.540 --> 06:41.620
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.750
What do you think?
This one or this one?

06:44.710 --> 06:46.710
Uh, I like
the leather jacket.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.500
Yeah, I could use
the extra body armor.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.790
Where are you going?

06:50.790 --> 06:52.290
The comedy club.

06:52.290 --> 06:54.040
Check out some acts.
"Make connections."

06:57.880 --> 07:00.460
Uh, do you want to come?

07:01.330 --> 07:02.460
-Oh, no, thanks.
-Great.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.250
Um, actually,
I was gonna ask

07:06.250 --> 07:10.500
if there may be some odd jobs
I could do around here

07:10.500 --> 07:13.330
for maybe a little break
on rent.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.670
Money's kind of
tight and all.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.170
Um...

07:19.880 --> 07:22.920
Well, okay, just...
I'll leave you to it.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.000
(chuckles)

07:25.670 --> 07:27.920
Just call me
if you need anything.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.620
(door closes)

07:31.620 --> 07:33.080
I think this is
more awkward for her.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.040
It doesn't have
to be awkward.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.330
No, I know.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.460
I really appreciate
you letting me help.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.040
Yeah. Well, we know
we work well together.

07:51.670 --> 07:52.620
So, just,

07:52.620 --> 07:54.750
uh, let me know
what I need to do.

07:54.750 --> 07:55.540
Gael: Yeah.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.750
(noisy chattering)

08:02.750 --> 08:05.250
-Hey.
-Yo, you came!

08:05.250 --> 08:06.170
Where's your partner?

08:06.170 --> 08:07.670
Joey. They had to work.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.170
I got a spot.
I'm going up tonight.

08:10.170 --> 08:12.620
Yes! Oh, my gosh.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.830
It's, like, crazy hard
to go up at this club,

08:14.830 --> 08:16.670
especially
if you're new.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.920
So, who did you
sleep with this time?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.170
Okay, hunty.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.420
-I only did that once
by the way.
-(chuckles)

08:22.420 --> 08:24.290
-Avery: You be judging.
-Sydney: I do be judging.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.170
-Wait, is that Lindsay Brady?
-Avery: Where?

08:31.580 --> 08:32.580
Oh, my God!

08:32.580 --> 08:34.039
What is she doing here?

08:34.039 --> 08:36.039
"They," they just changed
their pronoun.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.539
There's a lot
of that going around.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.380
Which I fully support.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.500
It's just tough
to remember.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.920
Life is so hard
as a white woman.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.960
(scoffs)

08:45.960 --> 08:47.790
Maybe they're workshopping
some new material.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.670
Well, I'm, like,
their number one stan.

08:49.670 --> 08:50.830
I've been trying forever
to get them

08:50.830 --> 08:52.120
to follow me back on Insta.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.960
Oh, my God,
not happening.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.170
They're very stingy
with their follows.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.500
Maybe if they hang out after,
we can meet them?

08:59.540 --> 09:00.670
-I mean--
-Shh, shh.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.670
Be cool.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.040
-Wow.
-Let's get a good seat.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.960
Gael: So, you want
to feather the paint on,

09:11.960 --> 09:13.750
just like this.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.460
Perfect.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.710
How's it going with Elijah?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.210
What do you mean?

09:36.170 --> 09:37.790
I mean, you're seeing
him again, aren't you?

09:44.790 --> 09:46.750
So, this is
my assistant Naveen,

09:46.750 --> 09:47.830
and this is Gael.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.580
-Hey.
-Gael: What's up, dude?

09:52.170 --> 09:52.960
Naveen: All right.

09:54.170 --> 09:57.170
Elijah:
So, the sewing tables
will be in the back.

09:57.170 --> 09:58.790
And out here,

09:58.790 --> 10:01.250
we'll have our new collection
on display,

10:01.250 --> 10:03.000
along with
a small boutique.

10:03.830 --> 10:06.000
-It's a great space.
-(chuckles)

10:07.790 --> 10:11.000
Elijah:
What... What?
What is this?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.830
This is just a thank-you
for Jazmin's dress.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.120
(sighs)

10:22.250 --> 10:26.790
-You framed this?
-Uh... yeah.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.500
-Y-you're welcome?
-It's just--

10:30.500 --> 10:31.750
A great review

10:31.750 --> 10:34.380
that you should be proud of
and hang it up in here.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.580
Thank you.

10:37.790 --> 10:39.710
Look at you
all low-key, humble.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.210
It's not that big
of a deal.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.540
(scoffs) If I got
a review like that,

10:42.540 --> 10:43.880
it would be a hell
of a big deal for me.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.670
I hope you're not still
stressing about that
Times review.

10:47.670 --> 10:49.170
Oh, you read that, huh?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.790
It's bullshit.
Don't take it to heart.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.540
Uh, so, lunch?

10:54.330 --> 10:55.920
You want to get lunch?

10:55.920 --> 10:57.250
A guy's got to eat.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.670
You could eat
without me.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.120
I could also do this
without you.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.750
But it wouldn't be
as fun.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.120
We're hanging out.

11:10.380 --> 11:11.620
How are you and Jamie?

11:14.290 --> 11:17.380
So, I know this isn't
exactly your scene.

11:17.380 --> 11:20.080
No, country club cocktail
parties are my favorite.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.620
-Just don't leave me
alone with the wives.
-(laughs)

11:23.960 --> 11:25.830
How white
is your firm?

11:26.750 --> 11:28.920
-They're working on that.
-Mm. And conservative?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.790
Aah, don't worry.
They're not all
Trump supporters.

11:31.790 --> 11:34.710
Well, as long as you're not
a registered Republican.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.790
-Are you?
-Garrett: Hey! There he is!

11:39.790 --> 11:40.790
Hey!

11:40.790 --> 11:42.710
And who is this lovely lady?

11:42.710 --> 11:44.330
This is
my girlfriend, Callie.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.290
This is Garrett, my boss.

11:45.290 --> 11:46.500
Hi! Lovely to meet you.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.750
The pleasure is mine.
She's a beauty.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.620
Yeah, she's
a lawyer as well.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.960
Re-really? Uh,
where do you work?

11:53.960 --> 11:55.120
Legal Aid.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.580
Oh. Good for you.

11:56.580 --> 11:57.830
I want you to meet my wife.

11:57.830 --> 11:59.290
Uh, Cynthia,
you remember Jamie?

11:59.290 --> 12:01.420
-Of course.
-It's good to see you again.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.290
And, hon, this is
Jamie's girlfriend, Callie.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.830
Will you introduce her
to the other ladies,

12:04.830 --> 12:06.920
while I steal him to meet
the New York partners?

12:06.920 --> 12:08.000
Cynthia:
Mm-hmm.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.040
Ugh, these things
are boring as hell.
Let's get you a drink.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.670
-Yes.
-(chuckles)

12:14.670 --> 12:15.750
Oh, It's beautiful.

12:15.750 --> 12:16.920
Oh, it's just lovely.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.330
It's such a great day.
Is champagne okay?

12:18.330 --> 12:19.790
-Yes, thank you.
-Great

12:20.920 --> 12:22.420
-Thank you.
-Heather: Oh, I know.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.960
It's a nightmare,
we did all our bathrooms.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.880
But once it's done,
we'll be so happy.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.080
Cynthia:
Ladies, this is Callie.
She's young Jamie's date.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.880
Oh, we love young Jamie.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.710
Old Jamie, not so much.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.380
I didn't know
there was an old Jamie.

12:34.380 --> 12:37.040
-He's a close talker.
-Like Joe Biden.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.790
(laughter)

12:38.790 --> 12:40.080
So, Callie,
what do you do?

12:40.080 --> 12:41.210
I'm a lawyer.

12:41.210 --> 12:43.040
-Oh.
-Oh, Heather and I
went to law school.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.290
It's where
I met my husband.

12:44.290 --> 12:45.420
Oh, where do you work?

12:45.420 --> 12:47.960
Oh, I haven't
for years.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.500
Oh, and I never did.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.620
Love law school,
hate the law.

12:50.620 --> 12:51.920
Well, it's hard to work
when you have kids.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.790
Personally, I love being
a stay-at-home mom.

12:54.790 --> 12:57.000
It's really the best decision
I ever made.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.580
Lauren:
Especially with
a full-time nanny.

12:58.580 --> 13:02.040
(women laughing)

13:02.040 --> 13:05.620
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

13:05.620 --> 13:06.670
Marcus:
Callie?

13:07.880 --> 13:09.290
I heard
you called in sick.

13:09.290 --> 13:11.040
I guess you must be
feeling better.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.000
Lindsay:
So I'm from Arizona.
Yeah, no, I-- it's not a choice.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
-I was born this way.
-(laughter)

13:21.000 --> 13:22.500
It's a tough place
to be from.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.790
You know,
it took us ten years

13:23.790 --> 13:25.500
to recognize
the MLK Holiday.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.040
(laughter)

13:27.040 --> 13:29.420
For sure. You know
what they say about Arizona,

13:29.420 --> 13:30.710
it's a dry hate.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.080
(laughter)

13:33.080 --> 13:34.460
I mean, we've got
the Grand Canyon.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.920
You know?
Got that going for us.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.500
I made it.
It was all me.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.920
Just me,
Phillips-head screwdriver,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.000
and a ton of angst.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.920
-(laughter)
-I spent a lot
of time on that.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.080
Alice:
You're so genius!
So smart.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.420
I like to think so.
Uh, let's see.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.330
So, Facebook has been
bleeding users.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.620
Like, 15 million people
have left the website.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.040
I mean,
I finally cut the cord.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.790
(cheers)

13:54.790 --> 13:57.420
Yes, I'm a true hero.
Absolutely.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.460
Being on Facebook
these days is like going
to an abandoned mall.

14:00.460 --> 14:03.380
-It's a retail
apocalypse, you know.
-(laughter)

14:03.380 --> 14:05.380
You're wandering around
and there's that chick

14:05.380 --> 14:08.120
from high school
trying to sell you a candle.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.290
Alice:
Candles.
Like lavender!

14:10.290 --> 14:11.790
I mean,
your parents are there.

14:11.790 --> 14:13.960
You know,
that whole thing.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.790
Alice:
So true!

14:15.790 --> 14:16.920
Mom and Dad

14:16.920 --> 14:18.380
are always liking
your photos.

14:18.380 --> 14:20.750
-Lindsay: You--
-(audience laughter)

14:22.080 --> 14:23.540
You know,
I can hear you, right?

14:23.540 --> 14:26.080
Like, this isn't a TV show.
Like, I'm actually here.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.380
Did your mom not teach
you how to use your
inside voice?

14:28.380 --> 14:29.960
-Audience Oh!
-Alice: No.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.670
I mean, we kind of had
a language barrier.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.830
-So, you know,
-(audience laughs)

14:33.830 --> 14:35.250
I'm Chinese.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.750
All right. Could we get
a light on this individual?

14:37.750 --> 14:39.170
What's happening over here?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.460
Lindsay: Oh, my God.
You talk more than
my Coche driver.

14:45.460 --> 14:48.210
-(laughter)
-Wait. are you
my Coche driver?

14:48.210 --> 14:49.670
(laughter)

14:49.670 --> 14:53.120
-This is why I gave
this person two stars.
-(audience groans)

14:53.120 --> 14:55.170
Lindsay: Oh, my God,
look at that leather jacket.

14:55.170 --> 14:57.880
I am sad that
a cow had to die

14:57.880 --> 15:00.210
for you to look
almost all right.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.170
(audience groans)

15:02.170 --> 15:04.040
You are literally
why I'm vegan.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.170
I would rather eat
a cashew cheese quesadilla

15:07.170 --> 15:09.000
than look at that jacket.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.210
It's terrible. Is that jacket
made out of nut cheese.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.670
You know. Has that kind
of a sheen to it.

15:14.670 --> 15:17.120
Did the '80s call you
on a landline and ask

15:17.120 --> 15:18.960
for Andrew Dice Clay's
whole thing back?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.880
Did the '90s follow up
with a fax

15:21.880 --> 15:24.000
and ask for George Michael's
entire thing back?

15:24.830 --> 15:27.250
So, there is this blogger

15:27.250 --> 15:29.120
who I guess a lot
of people follow,

15:30.080 --> 15:31.580
and he did
a great piece on Elijah,

15:31.580 --> 15:34.750
and he sent the guy
a link to my Insta

15:35.580 --> 15:37.210
and I guess now he wants
to interview me

15:37.210 --> 15:39.120
and see my work in person.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.170
That's great.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.210
I don't think
I'm going to do it.

15:44.210 --> 15:48.040
No, you can't let
one bad review shut you down.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.540
I'm just not confident
in the work that I have,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and I wish I could have
shown him the...

15:55.080 --> 15:56.960
the piece that I sold.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.670
You sure it looks
good there?

15:59.670 --> 16:01.250
Yeah, it looks great.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.000
Well, you could always make
another piece like it,

16:07.080 --> 16:08.420
as part of a series.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.170
Yeah.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.120
Bottom line, you can't let

16:12.120 --> 16:14.380
what anyone thinks of you
mess with your head.

16:14.380 --> 16:15.920
All that matters is

16:15.920 --> 16:18.000
what you think of yourself
and your work.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.670
The only way the world
will believe in you

16:20.670 --> 16:22.750
is if you believe
in yourself.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.040
I wasn't feeling well,
but I had forgotten

16:31.040 --> 16:33.210
I had promised my boyfriend
I'd come to this work thing,

16:33.210 --> 16:34.420
-so I rallied.
-Thank you.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.460
Well, I would love to meet him.
Which one is he?

16:36.460 --> 16:39.580
Uh, he's over there
in the blue suit.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.120
That white guy
in the blue suit

16:41.120 --> 16:44.170
or one of the other five
white guys in blue suits?

16:45.120 --> 16:47.790
Look, I know
you think I'm entitled,

16:47.790 --> 16:49.210
but this is not my world.

16:49.210 --> 16:51.000
Well, you blend in
pretty well.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.250
-Garrett: Marcus!
-Hey.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.420
Ah, I see
you've met, uh...

16:53.420 --> 16:55.330
-Callie.
-Right.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.580
She's also a lawyer
with Legal Aid.
Do you two know each other?

16:59.170 --> 17:01.670
-Yes, we do.
-Garrett: Ah!

17:02.830 --> 17:05.920
Callie, I apologize
for doing this to you again,
but I need to steal Marcus.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.210
There are some people
he needs to meet.
Will you excuse us?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.880
Sam: We got you
a welcome back gift.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.290
They're for ball-busting
stress relief.

17:36.670 --> 17:37.880
(Alex chuckles)

17:38.880 --> 17:41.960
Well, uh, we just figured,
since Mariana cut off yours.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.830
(Sam chuckles)

17:43.830 --> 17:46.290
You, you squish them
when you're stressed.

17:46.290 --> 17:49.290
Just give them, uh,
give them a fondle.

17:49.290 --> 17:51.380
-Pluck the hairs out--
-I get it!

17:51.380 --> 17:53.080
So, do we want to list

17:53.080 --> 17:55.170
the grievance committee
suggestions based on importance?

17:55.170 --> 17:56.920
Aren't they all important?

17:56.920 --> 17:58.380
Well, I think
a salary laddering plan

17:58.380 --> 18:00.830
is a little more important
than free tampons
in the women's room?

18:00.830 --> 18:02.380
That depends
how heavy your flow is.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.380
(chuckles)

18:04.670 --> 18:06.540
Hey! How's Raj doing now that
he's back on the Blue Team?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.170
Um, I'm pretty sure
he's miserable,

18:10.170 --> 18:11.580
but he wouldn't tell me,
just because

18:11.580 --> 18:14.210
it would make me feel worse
than I already do.

18:14.210 --> 18:15.420
And 'cause he's that great.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.380
-Aw.
-I need a Raj.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.500
-Right?
-Well, I need a raise.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.120
So, let's get back to it.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.750
(cell phones chiming)

18:24.750 --> 18:27.120
("Criminal" by
3 One Oh playing)

18:29.960 --> 18:31.080
What?

18:31.080 --> 18:33.420
 I was born
bad in my blood

18:34.620 --> 18:35.710
What?

18:35.710 --> 18:37.290
 Black as night...

18:37.290 --> 18:40.120
Uh, guys, you're gonna want
to look at your phones.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.880
 Out of the dark
I'll steal your heart

18:44.880 --> 18:47.960
 Light up a match
and I'll never look back

18:47.960 --> 18:50.210
 Oh oh oh oh oh...

18:50.210 --> 18:52.000
(Alex laughs)

18:52.380 --> 18:54.420
Oh, I knew it!

18:54.420 --> 18:56.710
All that feminist BS,
and she is just honeypotting

18:56.710 --> 18:58.830
her way up the ladder.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.790
(laughs)

19:00.790 --> 19:03.330
Oh, I bet she gives
great Act-ivism

19:03.330 --> 19:04.920
with that big mouth of hers.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.290
 Lock me up
throw away the key

19:07.290 --> 19:08.540
Don't fight!

19:08.540 --> 19:10.620
 Ain't nobody
as dangerous as me

19:10.620 --> 19:12.710
Dude, my Legos.
Come on.

19:12.710 --> 19:15.040
 Whoa oh oh
I'm a criminal

19:17.040 --> 19:18.290
Stop.

19:26.330 --> 19:28.460
Okay, look, I ran into Evan
in the elevator after work,

19:28.460 --> 19:30.040
and he asked me to grab
a drink with him to talk

19:30.040 --> 19:31.880
about my app,
and that's it!

19:33.330 --> 19:36.710
I wanted to talk to you
about... dating.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.880
You want to talk
about dating?

19:39.710 --> 19:42.790
Yes. Uh, what do you
think about it?

19:42.790 --> 19:45.250
You don't even need
to explain yourselves.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.290
Why can't a woman just have
a drink with her boss

19:47.290 --> 19:49.290
without everyone jumping
to conclusions?

19:49.290 --> 19:50.920
U-us dating?

19:50.920 --> 19:52.420
Oh, no.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.040
Not us dating.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.500
Uh, dating, in general.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.250
Well, have you ever tried
a dating app?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.830
I'm not very sure
how to describe myself.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.540
What do you think if I help you
set up your profile?

20:06.460 --> 20:08.420
-You'd do that?
-Yeah, of course.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.330
Because we have to be
above reproach
to be taken seriously.

20:11.330 --> 20:13.040
That's totally sexist.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.790
If Evan had a drink
with a guy from work,

20:14.790 --> 20:15.920
no one would care.

20:17.790 --> 20:20.380
My whole life I've had trouble
connecting with people.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.290
When I was a kid,
they called it Asperger's,

20:24.290 --> 20:26.250
but now they just say
I'm on the spectrum.

20:28.290 --> 20:31.960
I don't always pick up
social cues or... humor,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.670
why people like
to talk on the phone...

20:35.960 --> 20:37.620
things of that nature.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.380
I'm not even sure there's
someone out there for me.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.330
No, of course there's someone
out there for you.

20:51.420 --> 20:52.750
Which begs the big question:

20:52.750 --> 20:54.620
who did care enough to send
the photo to everyone?

20:54.620 --> 20:56.500
Everyone?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.040
They sent it
on the company Slack.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.170
Where's Raj?

21:02.170 --> 21:04.330
W-well, after
we broke up the fight,

21:04.330 --> 21:05.830
and by we,
I mean other people,

21:05.830 --> 21:08.580
and by other people,
I mean Evan,

21:08.580 --> 21:11.750
um, they, they took Alex
and Raj to the,

21:11.750 --> 21:13.500
-to the office.
-Fight?

21:13.500 --> 21:16.040
It's completely unacceptable
to have people coming
to blows at work.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.880
Who started it?

21:20.120 --> 21:22.580
Uh, we both started it.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.290
-Over what?
-Politics.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.670
We should have never gotten
into a discussion

21:28.670 --> 21:30.500
on how to make America
great again.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.670
Uh, I'll tell you my pitch:
flash mobs.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.750
Well, if we can agree
to disagree,

21:38.750 --> 21:41.710
why don't you two take
the rest of the day off
to cool down.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.170
(Evan clears throat)

21:52.750 --> 21:54.540
Really, Evan?

21:54.540 --> 21:55.830
No consequences?

21:55.830 --> 21:58.540
They're two of our
best engineers.

22:00.290 --> 22:01.500
Fine.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.210
Your decision.

22:03.210 --> 22:05.620
But what about this photo
of you and Mariana?

22:06.670 --> 22:08.750
Just two coworkers
having a drink after work.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.670
It's not two coworkers.

22:10.670 --> 22:11.920
You are her boss

22:11.920 --> 22:13.540
and the CEO
of this company,

22:13.540 --> 22:16.420
and we cannot afford to have
another Amanda situat--

22:16.420 --> 22:20.170
Angela, I'm well aware
of my position at my company!

22:21.460 --> 22:24.880
And I do not want
another Amanda situation either.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.460
I was so humiliated.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.620
I mean, I didn't even
pay my tab.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.500
I've never dined
and dashed in my life.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.710
I mean, I left my credit card
there, so hopefully
I won't get in trouble.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.670
Crap, that means I have
to go back and get it.

22:41.670 --> 22:44.540
You know what? Just forget it.
I'm just going to cancel it
and order a new one.

22:44.540 --> 22:48.080
Okay, listen, I'm sorry
Lindsay dragged you like that.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.960
Honestly, I'm not surprised.
They're not a nice person.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.670
Do you know them?

22:52.670 --> 22:54.790
Yeah, we have... history.

22:55.670 --> 22:57.000
Not like that.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.040
I dated their ex
who I really liked,

23:00.040 --> 23:03.620
and as soon as Lindsay found out
she was happy with someone else,

23:03.620 --> 23:04.710
they wanted her back.

23:04.710 --> 23:07.380
So Jenny broke up with me
to get back with Lindsay.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.210
And after a couple weeks,

23:09.210 --> 23:11.880
Lindsay got bored
and dumped her, again.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.790
Did Jenny try
to get back with you?

23:13.790 --> 23:16.000
Yeah, but once
the trust is broken,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.290
there's no going back
for me.

23:18.290 --> 23:20.500
Lindsay has broken up
a bunch of relationships

23:20.500 --> 23:24.170
just to get whatever
"it" girl they happen
to want at the moment.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.500
(sighs)

23:25.500 --> 23:27.250
I'm sorry.

23:27.250 --> 23:30.710
Yeah, it sucked,
but... I'm over it.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.290
Well, I'm ruined.

23:32.290 --> 23:34.500
I can't show my face
at any comedy club ever again.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.750
How can you be ruined?

23:35.750 --> 23:37.380
You haven't even
gotten up on stage.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.830
And who knows
if I ever will.

23:38.830 --> 23:40.620
Apparently, it's really hard
to get a spot

23:40.620 --> 23:42.040
when you're new
and you don't know anyone.

23:42.040 --> 23:45.250
Well, that's why you have
to go back and make connections.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.500
Don't let some mean girl
get in your way.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.120
-Mean person.
-Oh, sorry. Right.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.330
Yeah, you're right.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.750
Move out the way,
toe rag! Skrt-skrt!

23:56.750 --> 23:58.210
Toe rag?

23:58.210 --> 24:00.960
It's really hard to come up
with gender-neutral disses.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.750
-Is it too much?
-I...

24:12.580 --> 24:13.790
Hey!

24:13.790 --> 24:15.540
-Can we talk?
-Here?

24:15.540 --> 24:17.170
I guess you're not worried
people might think

24:17.170 --> 24:19.080
you're sleeping
with me anymore.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.420
-Please, I can explain.
-I'm sure you can.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.500
You're the best
con artist I know.

24:33.330 --> 24:35.210
Um, excuse me!

24:38.710 --> 24:40.620
Can I have
everyone's attention?

24:42.580 --> 24:44.580
Which I obviously already do.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.790
Not that it's anyone's business,
but I am not seeing Evan.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.330
-I'm seeing Raj.
-Man: I knew it!

24:54.670 --> 24:56.580
Man 2:
Yeah, yeah, I knew it.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.250
In fact, he's my boyfriend.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.210
So, if you want to talk about
something, talk about that!

25:35.670 --> 25:39.960
Callie: Maybe I should
just give up the law,
try and be an artist again.

25:41.670 --> 25:45.000
Do you ever regret
giving up art for law?

25:48.670 --> 25:50.330
Callie:
I regret a lot of things.
(chuckles)

26:11.330 --> 26:13.460
My boyfriend said
I was a lawyer,

26:13.460 --> 26:16.210
and his boss asked
where I worked so I told him,

26:16.210 --> 26:20.250
but I never said I was a lawyer
practicing law at Legal Aid.

26:20.250 --> 26:22.420
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

26:22.420 --> 26:23.880
Really?

26:23.880 --> 26:25.790
Because you seem to make a lot
of assumptions about me.

26:27.210 --> 26:30.460
Actually, why are you here?
Are you looking for a new job
in an elite firm?

26:30.460 --> 26:33.170
I am here to pick the pockets
of a rich law firm.

26:33.170 --> 26:35.670
Get them to atone for the sins
of their corporate clients

26:35.670 --> 26:37.960
by doing pro bono work
on behalf of some of ours.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.920
Well, maybe
I could help with that?

26:41.920 --> 26:44.210
Raising money for Legal Aid
is not your job,

26:44.210 --> 26:46.420
but I would still like
to meet your boyfriend.

26:46.420 --> 26:48.000
So you can judge
him too?

26:50.040 --> 26:53.710
Look, I know I made a mistake
writing that demand letter,

26:53.710 --> 26:56.080
and I have apologized...

26:56.080 --> 26:57.540
but I have
a hard time believing

26:57.540 --> 26:58.920
that that's all
you have against me.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.880
What I think about you
doesn't matter.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.420
The only thing that matters is
what you think of yourself.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.250
That you know
who you are.

27:06.830 --> 27:08.000
I learned the hard way.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.290
If you want the world
to believe in you,

27:09.290 --> 27:11.460
you have to believe
in yourself.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.830
The only way the world's going
to believe in you

27:12.830 --> 27:14.750
is if you believe
in yourself.

27:17.790 --> 27:19.040
I'll see you on Monday.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.750
And don't worry,
I won't tell anyone

27:21.750 --> 27:23.540
about running into you today.

27:33.170 --> 27:36.880
I told you I know where
Angela keeps her medicine.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.710
Well, we could have met
at a bar.

27:39.710 --> 27:42.580
Yeah, why pay when we
can drink here for free?

27:43.750 --> 27:45.670
Why didn't you tell Angela
I threw the first punch?

27:47.790 --> 27:50.960
'Cause we used
to be best friends.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.960
Until Mariana showed up
and you chose her.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.790
I chose not to be
a massive asshole.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.790
(exhales sharply)
Whatev.

28:02.420 --> 28:05.040
The team isn't the same
without you.

28:07.540 --> 28:09.040
You have Sam.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.960
Sam is an idiot.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.080
(chuckles)

28:13.080 --> 28:16.620
He's a decent third,
but he's not Spock material.

28:18.040 --> 28:21.000
Alex, you being Kirk is
wildly presumptuous, all right?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.960
The Federation wouldn't pick
someone without a logical--

28:23.960 --> 28:25.830
All right... ( sighs)
All right, you know what?

28:25.830 --> 28:27.960
I can't be your Spock, anyway,
if you continue

28:27.960 --> 28:30.210
to be a racist,
sexist dick.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.960
Oh, my God,
they're just jokes.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.500
Jokes... hurt.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.290
Well, you know what hurts?

28:39.290 --> 28:41.920
My jaw,
where you punched me.

28:44.670 --> 28:47.380
(cell phones buzzing)

28:53.330 --> 28:54.920
So, are you, like,
in love with her?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.500
Look, I get it.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.670
She's hot,

29:01.380 --> 29:03.670
and she told everyone
you're her boyfriend.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.880
That's, that's... Woo!

29:06.880 --> 29:10.250
That is extremely brave
for anyone to admit.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.170
See? Jokes.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.670
(sighs)

29:19.790 --> 29:21.580
You really don't think
I'm Kirk material?

29:39.250 --> 29:40.960
-Okay. So...
-(clears throat)

29:40.960 --> 29:44.750
...first question: What is
your idea of a romantic date?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.170
Romantic date?

29:47.290 --> 29:49.920
In movies, women enjoy
walking on the sand.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.040
Okay, walks on the beach.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.080
Would you mind
not telling anyone

29:58.080 --> 30:00.250
that you're helping me
do this?

30:00.250 --> 30:01.420
Yeah, of course.

30:02.420 --> 30:04.670
(laughs)
I thought that was you two.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.620
Who all here
has Josh tried to kiss?

30:09.960 --> 30:12.290
I-I just wanted
to say hello.

30:12.290 --> 30:13.710
This is a smear campaign.

30:13.710 --> 30:17.080
-(clears throat)
-Hello. How are you, Josh?

30:17.080 --> 30:18.920
Great. Great! I...

30:19.880 --> 30:21.960
got another job
at a different startup.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.460
Better pay. Better hours.

30:24.460 --> 30:28.040
Less, um, (chuckles)
less headaches.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.960
Yeah, but hey, you know,

30:30.960 --> 30:33.540
I wish Speckulate
all the luck in the world.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.290
No hard feelings.

30:36.290 --> 30:37.580
No hard feelings.

30:38.580 --> 30:41.040
Okay. (chuckles)
Well, see you around.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.380
That was sus.

30:49.420 --> 30:51.080
Suspect.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.790
Ah. Why do you
say that?

30:54.120 --> 30:56.000
Well, you fired him.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.250
You really don't think
he's holding a grudge?

30:58.250 --> 30:59.330
Oh.

31:00.420 --> 31:01.670
That is sus.

31:04.670 --> 31:07.170
(indistinct chatter)

31:13.290 --> 31:17.540
(laughter echoing)

31:22.500 --> 31:25.290
-(cheering)
-Did the '90s
follow up with a fax

31:25.290 --> 31:27.460
and ask for George Michael's
entire thing back?

31:38.380 --> 31:39.920
Oh, it's you.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.040
(chuckles awkwardly)

31:44.120 --> 31:46.080
Look, I'm sorry I tore
into you last night,

31:46.080 --> 31:47.460
but, you know,
even a happy heckler

31:47.460 --> 31:48.830
can mess up
a comedian's set.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.120
It's all about timing.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.290
Right. I,
I totally understand.

31:52.290 --> 31:53.420
Uh, my bad.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.210
But you are funny.

31:57.380 --> 31:58.830
-I am?
-Yeah.

32:00.710 --> 32:02.040
Hey, Alice,
Lindsay's here.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.620
Sydney: They're here.
They're...

32:03.620 --> 32:05.540
uh, here.

32:06.580 --> 32:07.750
-Hey.
-Lindsay: Hey.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.880
I was just telling
your friend she's funny.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.080
-Alice: Yeah.
-Avery: Oh, yeah.
She's a stand-up.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.040
-So are, so are we.
-Oh.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.960
I haven't technically
stood up, yet.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.250
Well, she does hilarious bits
on Insta, though.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.330
-You should check her out.
-All right.

32:19.830 --> 32:22.380
Hey, do you think that
we could get a picture?

32:22.380 --> 32:24.120
-Sure.
-(nervous chuckles)

32:24.120 --> 32:25.670
Let's do this.

32:25.670 --> 32:28.330
-Ooh! Uh!
-Hey, can you take
a picture of us?

32:28.330 --> 32:30.120
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Love it.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.000
-Okay, guys.
-(shutter clicks)

32:32.000 --> 32:32.960
woman: Smile.

32:34.170 --> 32:36.250
Okay, so don't screw up
my set tonight.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.500
I won't. Thanks!

32:37.500 --> 32:39.170
-Bye!
-She won't!

32:39.170 --> 32:41.080
Lindsay Brady.
Lindsay Brady!

32:42.000 --> 32:43.710
That was
Lindsay Brady!

32:43.710 --> 32:45.210
Oh, my gosh, look!

32:45.210 --> 32:46.540
Oh, my gosh,
I look good.

32:52.250 --> 32:53.250
Hey.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.040
Hey.

32:56.290 --> 32:57.670
So, I did the interview.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.670
How'd it go?

33:00.750 --> 33:02.670
I don't know.
I haven't looked at it yet.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.170
Can you just tell me
if it's good or bad?

33:06.170 --> 33:08.120
'Cause I don't want
to look at it.

33:11.920 --> 33:14.290
"Bold AF LA Artist

33:14.290 --> 33:15.920
"Everyone Will Be
Talking About,

33:15.920 --> 33:17.580
If They Aren't Already."

33:17.580 --> 33:19.580
Gael (laughing):
Are you kidding me?

33:20.880 --> 33:23.380
"Everything about the work
of Gael Martinez shows

33:23.380 --> 33:25.750
"the promise of an artist
ready to break out

33:25.750 --> 33:27.960
"and shake up
the art world.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.540
If you don't know him now,
you will."

33:31.420 --> 33:33.250
(exclaims excitedly)

33:33.250 --> 33:34.250
(laughs)

33:34.250 --> 33:36.120
Oh, my God.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.580
We have to celebrate!

33:39.580 --> 33:40.750
With everyone.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.330
-(cell phone buzzing)
-Oh, give me a second.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.250
-Hey.
-Elijah: (over phone)
Did you see it?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
-Gael: (over phone) I did.
-Elijah: I told you!

33:50.540 --> 33:52.040
I can't believe it!

33:52.040 --> 33:53.380
I really can't.

33:53.380 --> 33:55.080
-I can.
-Thank you.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.620
This is because of you.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.290
Oh, all I did was turn them on
to a talented artist.

33:59.290 --> 34:00.540
You did everything else.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.000
But look, I'm taking you
out to celebrate.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.670
So, uh, get ready and meet me
at Perch in 20 minutes.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.420
Hey, so Elijah wanted to--

34:10.420 --> 34:12.790
Yeah, no, you should go
celebrate with him.

34:13.330 --> 34:14.170
Have fun!

34:14.920 --> 34:16.290
You wanna pick this up
tomorrow night?

34:16.290 --> 34:17.210
Sure.

34:17.210 --> 34:19.250
All right.
(inhales sharply)

34:19.250 --> 34:20.540
(shrieks)

34:28.380 --> 34:30.380
I have got those
fabric swatches for you.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.670
Dope. Just, uh, leave 'em
on my desk.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.960
I'll get to 'em tomorrow.

34:35.080 --> 34:38.080
-Wait, did you frame that?
-(Elijah chuckles)

34:38.080 --> 34:41.330
Gael did, as a thank you
for Jazmin's dress.

34:41.330 --> 34:44.000
Okay, but does he know that
you paid for that review?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.670
No, and he's not going to
because I paid for his, too.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.620
Oh, how much did that cost you?

34:49.460 --> 34:50.960
You have got it bad
for that boy.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.880
Look, it wasn't
about publicity for him,

34:52.880 --> 34:54.250
he just needed
a confidence boost.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.380
(Naveen chuckles)

34:55.380 --> 34:58.210
And, uh, seriously,
he can never know.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.420
(cell phone chimes)

35:04.580 --> 35:08.210
Washed up in places
I never gave permission.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.290
But I'll tell you one thing,
I've never been more radiant.

35:13.670 --> 35:14.580
-So I'm from Arizona.
-(crowd cheering, applauding)

35:14.580 --> 35:16.040
Okay, take it easy.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.040
It's not a choice,
I was born this way.

35:18.540 --> 35:20.620
It's a tough place to be from,
took us ten years...

35:20.620 --> 35:22.750
-Hey.
-...to recognize MLK Day.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.250
Oh.
(chuckles)

35:24.250 --> 35:25.710
Is that Lindsay's Insta?

35:25.710 --> 35:27.380
Um, yeah.

35:27.380 --> 35:28.460
They followed me.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.250
Oh.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.880
And they liked
one of my videos!

35:32.880 --> 35:35.080
The one where I'm the old lady
who's pissed at the bidet.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.000
(chuckles)

35:36.880 --> 35:38.960
-That's great.
-Yeah, it is.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.540
Um, it's a major promotion,
you know.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.000
Okay.

35:43.670 --> 35:45.920
Okay?
What does that mean?

35:45.920 --> 35:49.000
It means,
they totally humiliated you,

35:49.000 --> 35:52.080
in front of everyone
at their show last night.

35:53.420 --> 35:56.170
And now, because
they're following you,

35:57.120 --> 35:58.790
suddenly all is forgiven?

35:58.790 --> 36:01.330
They actually apologized.

36:01.330 --> 36:04.210
They were there again tonight,
and we ran into each other
in the restroom,

36:04.210 --> 36:06.000
and at first,
they were like, "It's you!"

36:06.000 --> 36:07.170
I was like, "Oh, shit!"
(chuckles)

36:07.170 --> 36:08.420
But then,
they were really nice,

36:08.420 --> 36:09.960
and they actually said
I was funny.

36:11.210 --> 36:15.000
And did you... happen
to mention your partner,

36:15.000 --> 36:16.170
who they totally burned?

36:17.420 --> 36:19.000
No.
(chuckles)

36:19.000 --> 36:20.920
That didn't come up.

36:23.380 --> 36:26.710
Look, it's not like
we're BFFs.

36:26.710 --> 36:28.080
They just liked
one of my videos,

36:28.080 --> 36:29.670
and this could be
really good exposure for me

36:29.670 --> 36:31.670
in the comedy world.

36:31.670 --> 36:34.580
You're the one who told me
to go back out there

36:34.580 --> 36:36.330
and make connections.

36:36.330 --> 36:38.580
Lindsay Brady is
a huge connection.

36:38.580 --> 36:39.750
I know that.

36:41.420 --> 36:42.880
I just don't trust them...

36:44.960 --> 36:46.250
and I want you
to be careful.

36:47.250 --> 36:48.170
I will.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.620
This is a big deal.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.540
Well, they think you're funny,

36:57.170 --> 36:59.080
so at least they have
good taste.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.420
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

37:08.210 --> 37:09.420
(cell phone chimes)

37:29.540 --> 37:32.120
(both laughing)

37:36.250 --> 37:37.540
Mariana: I guess
I should have just told him

37:37.540 --> 37:39.880
that I was having drinks
with Evan in the first place,

37:39.880 --> 37:42.500
but he's already so jealous
of him as it is.

37:43.540 --> 37:46.290
Are you going to keep helping
Evan with his dating profile?

37:47.880 --> 37:48.920
I guess.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.380
He was so cute,
and I feel bad for him.

37:51.380 --> 37:54.460
Why don't you just tell Raj that
that's what it was all about.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.000
I said I wouldn't
tell anyone.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.170
Yeah, but he's your boyfriend,

37:58.170 --> 37:59.460
and you have
to be honest with him.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.540
Right.
(sighs)

38:02.540 --> 38:03.790
How's your boyfriend?

38:10.460 --> 38:13.290
Divestments, selling off
underperforming units,

38:13.290 --> 38:15.920
layoffs,
some tax shelter work.

38:16.790 --> 38:18.710
Cynthia: We had to get our son
a tutor for the ISEEs.

38:18.710 --> 38:22.210
Oh, us too. Dylan wants
to go to Harvard-Westlake.

38:24.620 --> 38:26.080
Callie: What kind of law
do you practice?

38:26.080 --> 38:28.210
Man: I mostly fight
government regulation

38:28.210 --> 38:29.380
of antitrust
or anticompetitive practices

38:29.380 --> 38:31.080
of the corporations
we represent.

38:33.620 --> 38:36.250
-Uh, what's the ISEEs?
-Independent School
Entrance Exams.

38:36.250 --> 38:39.500
-It's worse than the SATs.
-Yeah, but you don't want to
send your kids to public school.

38:47.620 --> 38:49.040
We went with Duchateau floors

38:49.040 --> 38:51.750
which our interior designer
insisted on,

38:51.750 --> 38:53.540
but her installer
glued them down

38:53.540 --> 38:55.500
instead of nailing,
and now they're buckling.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.500
Oh, no.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.620
Yes!
(sighs)

38:57.620 --> 38:59.500
Luckily, we're going
to Napa for two weeks

38:59.500 --> 39:02.460
while they rip them out,
but it is still a nightmare.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.960
Cynthia: Napa is beautiful
this time of year.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.460
Oh, I know.

39:06.460 --> 39:08.540
You know, I thought I was busy
when I was working,

39:08.540 --> 39:10.920
but this remodel
has been so stressful.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.460
I really need a vacation.

39:17.670 --> 39:20.580
(talking indistinctly)

39:23.040 --> 39:24.420
Jamie: Callie?

39:24.420 --> 39:25.380
There you are.

39:28.290 --> 39:29.710
Everything okay?

39:29.710 --> 39:31.380
No.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.540
No, I'm scared.

39:35.670 --> 39:37.210
I'm never going
to fit into your world,

39:37.210 --> 39:38.250
and I don't want to.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.710
I don't want to quit
my career

39:40.710 --> 39:44.000
to raise our kids
and remodel our home.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.830
I can't be the wife you need
to succeed in all of this.

39:51.420 --> 39:52.580
I love you...

39:53.580 --> 39:55.330
but I don't think
we want the same things.

40:00.670 --> 40:01.580
There you are.

40:03.460 --> 40:04.620
Everything okay?

40:06.460 --> 40:08.540
Yeah. I was just taking
a break.

40:13.540 --> 40:16.290
Uh, we can get out of here
if you're ready?

40:16.290 --> 40:18.000
-Sure, if you are.
-Mm-hmm.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.330
You never answered
my question.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.460
I am a registered Republican,

40:31.540 --> 40:33.540
but I didn't vote
for the current president.

40:46.580 --> 40:47.750
We're fine.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.540
(door opens)

40:53.120 --> 40:54.170
(clears throat)

40:55.670 --> 40:57.460
It's like deja vu
all over again.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.420
He really needs to invest
in some serious curtains.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.620
I think he's really
into this one.

41:10.580 --> 41:13.210
Well, I'm not sticking around
for the show this time.

41:19.670 --> 41:20.670
Mariana?

41:26.920 --> 41:28.250
All right, coming.
