WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:04.121
He wants to hack Steel
Mountain's climate control system,

00:04.122 --> 00:07.454
raise the facility's heat high
enough to destroy all the tapes.

00:07.455 --> 00:08.248
This is what we're doing.

00:08.283 --> 00:10.450
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact
as soon as you take off.

00:10.485 --> 00:13.673
You just gonna hit up the
world's most dangerous hacker crew?

00:13.674 --> 00:15.088
He has my bank account, Ollie.

00:15.123 --> 00:20.367
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network
because of this. I'll lose my job.

00:20.545 --> 00:22.796
Evil Corp's upping their
security protocol.

00:22.848 --> 00:23.797
They are physically copying,

00:23.849 --> 00:26.154
then shipping all
the analog backups.

00:26.155 --> 00:27.434
We go up today.

00:27.469 --> 00:29.518
_

00:29.543 --> 00:31.795
_

00:31.919 --> 00:34.119
_

00:34.176 --> 00:37.528
I want you to be where
you belong, here with me.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.180
I think I'm happy where I am.

00:40.215 --> 00:42.282
Don't let
me down, okay?

00:42.317 --> 00:44.534
That girl in there is mine.

00:44.569 --> 00:46.486
Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

00:46.521 --> 00:48.538
He's on murder charges.
Do you know that?

00:48.573 --> 00:50.323
It's my plan. I'll go in.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.042
You might be able to
hide it from these nerds,

00:52.077 --> 00:53.960
but I know a junkie
when I see one.

00:53.996 --> 00:56.716
- I'm alone.
- No, you're not.

00:56.717 --> 00:58.498
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:22.024 --> 01:23.523
I wish I had better
news for you, Fernando,

01:23.525 --> 01:25.692
but this isn't the
you're-getting-out meeting.

01:27.362 --> 01:29.863
This is only as much
as I could carry.

01:29.865 --> 01:31.081
The D.A. has more.

01:33.585 --> 01:37.404
- How long this gonna be?
- We're talking years.

01:37.439 --> 01:38.705
Yo, you playing?

01:38.740 --> 01:40.674
You get our people out.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.275
That's your use to us.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.044
They have a solid case.

01:44.079 --> 01:45.645
For every charge they're
gonna lay on you,

01:45.681 --> 01:48.915
they have these binders,
your Twitters, your Instagram.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.269
You said they wouldn't
figure this shit out.

01:53.305 --> 01:54.354
They can't, brah.

01:54.389 --> 01:56.523
I'm telling you, it
was airtight, V.

01:56.558 --> 01:59.526
Fellas, this isn't
the imitation game.

01:59.561 --> 02:01.111
The code here is not
that complicated.

02:01.146 --> 02:03.063
Besides, who told you
to put your business

02:03.065 --> 02:05.615
anywhere near social media?

02:05.650 --> 02:08.785
My aspirational
little brother.

02:08.820 --> 02:12.789
You know how much money
we saved last year?

02:12.824 --> 02:15.075
Made our whole operation
way more efficient.

02:15.077 --> 02:16.543
We were careful.

02:16.578 --> 02:17.939
You tweeted about
every transaction

02:17.963 --> 02:19.079
your business was involved in.

02:19.081 --> 02:21.798
That is the opposite
of careful.

02:21.833 --> 02:25.418
It's no wonder an
anonymous tip turned you in.

02:25.420 --> 02:29.222
- Who called in the tip?
- This is what is meant by anonymous.

02:29.257 --> 02:31.091
It is now spilled milk.

02:31.143 --> 02:32.142
The information got out,

02:32.177 --> 02:34.427
and now they're
coming down hard.

02:34.429 --> 02:35.589
There's no plea on the table.

02:35.597 --> 02:37.097
They're gonna lay
murder one on you.

02:37.099 --> 02:38.598
I ain't pleading anyway.

02:38.650 --> 02:39.983
Men can't sentence me.

02:40.018 --> 02:42.402
That is a cosmic
responsibility.

02:44.940 --> 02:47.741
Someone's gonna get
hurt for this.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.859
That's how we get square
with the universe.

02:49.911 --> 02:52.112
Fernando, we need to
discuss strategy.

02:52.164 --> 02:55.616
- You don't want Supermax.
- Naw, naw.

02:58.703 --> 03:02.417
If they lock me up, the kind of
door they close don't matter.

03:27.649 --> 03:31.913
So that's you.
That's who you are.

03:32.988 --> 03:36.218
I know you.

03:47.436 --> 03:51.217
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

04:09.524 --> 04:10.523
Excuse me.

04:10.525 --> 04:12.025
Pardon me. Pardon me.
I already paid.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.693
Just want to pay my respects.

04:13.695 --> 04:14.861
Thank you. Thank you.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.495
Ooh, I'm sorry, man. Sorry.

04:16.531 --> 04:18.197
Just want to pay
my compliments.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.867
Hey, excellent coffee,
fantastic service.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.554
Buy yourself something nice.

04:35.022 --> 04:36.970
_

04:38.436 --> 04:40.937
Steel Mountain.

04:40.972 --> 04:43.056
We're trying to penetrate
a data security facility

04:43.108 --> 04:45.308
whose tagline literally is...

04:51.366 --> 04:53.399
Nothing is actually
impenetrable.

04:53.451 --> 04:55.768
A place like this says
it is, and it's close,

04:55.804 --> 04:58.705
but people still
built this place.

04:58.740 --> 05:00.039
And if you can hack
the right person,

05:00.075 --> 05:01.324
all of a sudden,

05:01.376 --> 05:03.743
you have a piece of
powerful malware.

05:03.795 --> 05:06.412
People always make
the best exploits.

05:06.464 --> 05:09.332
I've never found it
hard to hack most people.

05:09.384 --> 05:11.334
If you listen to
them, watch them,

05:11.386 --> 05:12.752
their vulnerabilities are like

05:12.754 --> 05:15.088
a neon sign screwed
into their heads.

05:15.123 --> 05:16.756
Mobley's a glutton.

05:16.808 --> 05:18.591
He lacks discipline
from his urges.

05:18.643 --> 05:20.927
I don't want to get
bugs. They spread disease.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.396
Romero is a know-it-all
and a hypochondriac.

05:23.431 --> 05:25.798
Bill Harper
is our first exploit.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.333
He isn't gonna give the
search much scrutiny.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.568
He'll get us to Level 1,

05:28.603 --> 05:29.936
but Bill is not gonna be
able to get us to Level 2.

05:29.988 --> 05:31.938
And we need to get to Level 2.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.607
You're gonna ask to speak
to his supervisor, Wendy.

05:34.609 --> 05:36.643
She'll get us to exactly
where we need to be.

05:36.678 --> 05:38.661
Then we'll be able to get
rid of her from the van.

05:38.697 --> 05:41.114
After that, you connect
the Raspberry Pi

05:41.116 --> 05:43.416
to the climate control
system, and Bob's your uncle.

05:48.540 --> 05:51.424
Now we can hear you,
and you can hear us.

05:51.459 --> 05:52.759
Mr. Robot?

05:52.794 --> 05:54.627
His flaw is he's
absolutely insane.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.596
We're talking clinical.

05:56.631 --> 05:58.848
When they say, "If your friends
jump off a bridge, would you?"

05:58.883 --> 06:00.967
he would, without hesitation,

06:00.969 --> 06:02.468
just to prove something.

06:02.470 --> 06:04.137
He goes in there, he's liable
to blow the whole place up,

06:04.139 --> 06:06.472
just like he wanted to
in the first place.

06:06.474 --> 06:07.994
Sure you don't want
to look over the info

06:07.995 --> 06:10.310
- and the map again?
- I got it.

06:10.312 --> 06:13.112
Okay, James Bond, let's
go mess their shit up.

06:13.148 --> 06:14.280
Boom, boom.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.319
Yes, I also
have security flaws.

06:19.371 --> 06:21.154
I don't like being outside.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.572
I liked morphine too much.

06:22.624 --> 06:24.457
Mr. Sepiol?

06:24.492 --> 06:25.825
I'm talking
to you right now,

06:25.827 --> 06:27.493
and you don't exist.

06:27.495 --> 06:30.129
Sam Sepiol?

06:30.165 --> 06:31.798
Sir?

06:31.833 --> 06:34.334
That's you, Elliot.

06:34.386 --> 06:36.252
Okay.

06:36.304 --> 06:37.670
So sorry you had to wait.

06:37.672 --> 06:40.173
As you can see, there's
always a lot of bustle here.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.507
How can I help you today?

06:41.509 --> 06:44.093
You need a
tour. Don't elaborate.

06:44.145 --> 06:47.263
Um... a tour.

06:48.683 --> 06:50.350
Okay.

06:50.352 --> 06:51.985
I'm sure they told
you at reception

06:52.020 --> 06:54.520
that we... we require
appointments for tours.

06:54.572 --> 06:57.273
My supervisor gives us
all a hard time about that.

06:58.276 --> 07:01.361
I'm Sam Sepiol.

07:01.363 --> 07:02.578
You should look me up.

07:02.614 --> 07:04.080
Okay.

07:04.115 --> 07:07.000
A little inelegant,
but we can work with it.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.201
Tell you what.

07:08.203 --> 07:10.620
Have your company call
over to new accounts,

07:10.672 --> 07:13.423
and we can set something
up later this week.

07:13.458 --> 07:15.291
Ask for Bill Harper.

07:15.343 --> 07:16.292
They'll know where to find me.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.543
Listen, Bill.

07:17.545 --> 07:19.712
You think your boss
gives you a hard time now?

07:19.714 --> 07:21.214
You're gonna get a
really hard time

07:21.216 --> 07:22.416
right after I
walk out of here.

07:22.434 --> 07:24.384
I'm not rescheduling, Bill.

07:24.386 --> 07:26.352
When I walk out that door,
I'm never coming back.

07:26.388 --> 07:28.388
That's your ass, Bill.

07:30.725 --> 07:32.725
I really think you
should look me up.

07:34.229 --> 07:36.195
It... it just doesn't
work like that.

07:36.231 --> 07:38.231
I'm sorry, sir.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.233
You take care, okay?

07:45.907 --> 07:47.990
I'm coming out.
It's not working.

07:48.043 --> 07:49.125
It's gonna work.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.326
Hang in there.

07:50.378 --> 07:51.794
I was being too weird.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.546
Just like every
other tech billionaire.

07:53.581 --> 07:56.416
Slow your roll.
It's gonna happen.

08:00.088 --> 08:03.089
It's no wonder
Wikipedia is never accurate.

08:03.091 --> 08:06.592
Anyone can edit them.

08:06.594 --> 08:07.894
Well, not anyone.

08:07.929 --> 08:10.680
Nerds like Mobley built a
lot of credit over the years

08:10.732 --> 08:12.432
with his 20,000 edits.

08:12.434 --> 08:14.517
And still people trust it,

08:14.569 --> 08:17.403
beholden to all the Mobleys of
the world for their information.

08:17.439 --> 08:19.322
Mr. Sepiol?

08:19.357 --> 08:20.523
Mr. Sepiol!

08:20.575 --> 08:22.241
I have some good news.

08:24.877 --> 08:26.594
Stop it. Stop it.

08:26.629 --> 08:28.296
Can you stop packing
for, like, five minutes?

08:28.348 --> 08:30.631
Can we just hash this
out like adults?

08:30.684 --> 08:33.183
I love you.

08:33.219 --> 08:34.602
You don't even know
why you're crying.

08:34.636 --> 08:36.770
Let's get married.

08:36.806 --> 08:38.139
Ollie, will you please stop?

08:38.140 --> 08:41.859
Angela... Angela, you can't
just give up on us like this.

08:48.034 --> 08:50.368
I mean, have you even
thought this through?

08:50.403 --> 08:52.954
What are you gonna do, go
live with your dad in Jersey?

08:52.989 --> 08:54.655
Come on.

08:56.326 --> 09:01.021
- You're ruining your life.
- Maybe, but I also ruined yours.

09:02.382 --> 09:04.499
Why do you have my work ID?

09:11.725 --> 09:14.592
Did you...

09:14.644 --> 09:18.146
did you... do you... do you...

09:18.181 --> 09:20.982
do you know what's
gonna happen?

09:21.017 --> 09:23.017
There will be fallout from this,
and I'm gonna tell them...

09:23.069 --> 09:27.321
I used your computer, so
tell them whatever you want.

09:27.357 --> 09:29.690
Are you serious?

09:29.743 --> 09:33.694
Did you even think about
how this would affect me?

09:36.249 --> 09:38.166
I did.

09:45.341 --> 09:47.508
Here's an idea
of how big this place is.

09:47.544 --> 09:50.044
We have our own fire department,
inside the building,

09:50.096 --> 09:51.512
just for us.

09:51.548 --> 09:54.449
And you can't have a fire
department without a fire truck,

09:54.484 --> 09:56.884
and you can't have a
fire truck without roads.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.987
We have all of that, inside.

10:00.023 --> 10:01.689
Imagine that.

10:09.265 --> 10:11.632
Elliot, now's
the time we get rid of Bill.

10:12.669 --> 10:14.368
There's so much information...

10:14.404 --> 10:16.704
Okay, we're gonna
need to roll up our sleeves here.

10:16.739 --> 10:20.074
You have to destroy Bill in
order to get to a supervisor.

10:20.110 --> 10:23.611
There's one vault in here
that's 200,000 square feet.

10:23.646 --> 10:25.146
That's the size of
a shopping mall,

10:25.181 --> 10:27.415
and that's just one.

10:28.551 --> 10:32.560
- Bill, where are those giant vaults?
- They're on Level 2,

10:32.561 --> 10:34.005
but that's not
part of the tour.

10:34.057 --> 10:36.224
Even I don't have
authorization.

10:36.259 --> 10:38.009
He's not gonna
take you for ice cream.

10:38.061 --> 10:39.811
He has to go away.

10:39.846 --> 10:42.763
There's no place in
this plan for Bill.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.600
Now, right down here...

10:45.652 --> 10:47.101
Everything okay, sir?

10:47.103 --> 10:50.021
We need to tear
Bill down piece by piece.

10:50.073 --> 10:53.241
You need to wipe that smile
off of his stupid face.

10:53.276 --> 10:55.827
Sir, are you okay?

10:55.862 --> 10:58.663
You're not... you're
not saying anything.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.867
Dig
into him, Elliot.

11:07.957 --> 11:10.758
You of all people can
do this, Elliot.

11:10.793 --> 11:13.628
You know how it feels when
someone makes you small.

11:13.630 --> 11:16.380
You understand what
happens when someone exposes

11:16.432 --> 11:18.432
the thing you fear
most about yourself.

11:18.468 --> 11:19.433
Answer me!

11:19.469 --> 11:20.968
Answer me!

11:23.389 --> 11:24.856
Get up.

11:24.891 --> 11:28.142
Just get up!

11:29.445 --> 11:31.646
I hate you.

11:31.698 --> 11:34.699
You're nothing.

11:34.734 --> 11:36.234
You're worthless.

11:39.906 --> 11:41.956
Think about it, Bill.

11:41.991 --> 11:44.375
Think about what?

11:48.998 --> 11:50.665
If you died,

11:50.667 --> 11:53.167
would anyone care?

11:55.171 --> 11:58.005
Would they really care?

11:58.057 --> 12:01.559
Yeah, maybe they'd
cry for a day,

12:01.594 --> 12:03.010
but let's be honest.

12:03.062 --> 12:06.180
No one would give a shit.

12:06.232 --> 12:08.432
They wouldn't.

12:08.484 --> 12:11.852
The few people that would feel
obligated to go to your funeral

12:11.854 --> 12:14.522
would probably be annoyed

12:14.574 --> 12:17.108
and leave as early
as possible.

12:26.169 --> 12:28.703
That's who you are.

12:28.755 --> 12:31.289
That's what you are.

12:31.341 --> 12:35.876
You're nothing to anyone,

12:35.929 --> 12:37.929
to everyone.

12:39.599 --> 12:42.300
Think about it, Bill.

12:43.353 --> 12:46.187
'Cause if you do,

12:46.222 --> 12:48.222
if you let yourself...

12:50.393 --> 12:52.727
You'll know I'm telling
you the truth.

12:54.447 --> 12:57.064
So instead of wasting
any more of my time,

12:57.066 --> 13:00.952
I need you to go call
someone that matters,

13:00.987 --> 13:02.954
because, Bill...

13:04.958 --> 13:06.407
You don't.

13:11.547 --> 13:14.665
I'll...

13:14.717 --> 13:16.717
I'll call my supervisor.

13:18.338 --> 13:21.088
And that's why Bill
Harper is a perfect exploit,

13:21.140 --> 13:23.924
desperate enough for the
business to break protocol

13:23.926 --> 13:27.228
and let me in.

13:27.263 --> 13:29.063
Lonely enough to break.

13:29.098 --> 13:32.266
I need a supervisor in L1S3.

13:32.318 --> 13:33.434
Copy that.

13:40.026 --> 13:41.942
Don't apologize.

13:41.944 --> 13:45.613
You're almost there.
You did great.

13:45.665 --> 13:47.782
Once Wendy gets
there, we'll send her a text

13:47.834 --> 13:51.285
letting her know her
pregnant wife is in labor.

13:51.287 --> 13:53.120
Once she leaves, that
should give you enough time

13:53.122 --> 13:54.789
to plant the Pi, you dig?

13:57.427 --> 13:58.626
Trudy Davis,
Accounts Supervisor.

13:58.678 --> 14:00.232
Is there a problem here?

14:00.233 --> 14:02.008
- Mr. Sepiol is asking...
- Trudy?

14:02.009 --> 14:04.213
- What the fuck? - for
someone more senior than me.

14:04.434 --> 14:06.934
I don't seem to
have your name.

14:06.969 --> 14:10.771
I'm Sam Sepiol?

14:11.808 --> 14:13.802
- Is that a question?
- Trudy? Trudy?

14:13.803 --> 14:14.892
Where's Wendy?

14:14.944 --> 14:16.560
We only prepped for Wendy.
Where the hell is Wendy?

14:16.612 --> 14:18.312
I need Wendy, actually.

14:18.364 --> 14:21.982
And how do you know Wendy?
She didn't come in today.

14:24.545 --> 14:26.046
_

14:26.047 --> 14:28.239
What is it that
you need, Mr. Sepiol?

14:28.291 --> 14:31.792
Um...

14:31.828 --> 14:34.578
I would love a
tour of Level 2.

14:34.630 --> 14:35.663
I don't know what
you've been told,

14:35.715 --> 14:37.665
but we don't allow that.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.667
I'll see you out.
You can go, Bill.

14:39.669 --> 14:41.802
Follow me to the lobby.

14:49.212 --> 14:50.211
This woman's a ghost.

14:50.246 --> 14:51.445
None of these are her.

14:51.481 --> 14:52.646
No Facebook, no LinkedIn.

14:52.682 --> 14:54.315
She's been married
for 30 years.

14:54.350 --> 14:55.983
All we have is her
husband's cell phone number.

14:56.018 --> 14:56.984
He doesn't even have
a picture online.

14:57.019 --> 14:58.619
No hobbies, no kids,

14:58.654 --> 15:01.455
no credit problems,
no weird sex stuff.

15:01.491 --> 15:02.957
House paid off.

15:02.992 --> 15:04.392
I need... I need
to... I need to think.

15:04.427 --> 15:08.329
The
elevator's almost here.

15:08.364 --> 15:13.167
Yes, that's how they work
when you press the button.

15:14.470 --> 15:15.569
Okay.

15:15.605 --> 15:18.773
People... people are
all just people, right?

15:18.808 --> 15:20.274
When it gets down to
it, everyone's the same.

15:20.309 --> 15:21.409
They love something.

15:21.444 --> 15:22.643
They want something.
They fear something.

15:22.678 --> 15:24.412
Specifics help, but
specifics don't change

15:24.447 --> 15:25.913
the way that everyone
is vulnerable.

15:25.948 --> 15:30.050
It just changes the way that we
access those vulnerabilities.

15:34.074 --> 15:37.363
_

15:52.291 --> 15:55.242
I-I have to go. I'm sorry.

15:55.244 --> 15:56.577
I need to go to my office.

15:56.579 --> 15:59.330
Reception will see you out.

16:07.473 --> 16:09.256
What'd you do?

16:09.308 --> 16:11.258
I spoofed a
text from her husband.

16:11.592 --> 16:15.443
_

16:23.587 --> 16:25.260
_

16:26.275 --> 16:27.825
It's a palm print scanner.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.995
Get out of there.

16:31.030 --> 16:32.863
There's one
door manually locked.

16:32.915 --> 16:35.122
It's a fire code thing,
and I think you can pick it.

16:35.123 --> 16:37.051
- Where?
- It's at the end of the hallway

16:37.086 --> 16:39.503
if you're heading north on L1.

17:07.148 --> 17:08.147
The stairs don't
go to Level 2.

17:08.150 --> 17:09.700
They go to a parking lot.

17:09.734 --> 17:12.368
You're on the complete
wrong side of the building.

17:12.405 --> 17:14.320
You're gonna have to double
back and go through the door

17:14.373 --> 17:17.374
you came in and
make a run for it.

17:21.696 --> 17:23.530
Elliot...

17:25.367 --> 17:27.501
I thought I saw you.

17:27.636 --> 17:29.052
What are you doing here?

17:30.541 --> 17:33.377
Thank you. Y'all come
back to Wingstravaganza.

17:33.728 --> 17:34.844
Okay, real important...

17:34.896 --> 17:37.703
Wingstravaganza means
wings and extravaganza.

17:37.704 --> 17:40.500
- Do you know what extravaganza means?
- Yep, it's a big deal.

17:40.501 --> 17:42.235
You got it.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.021
You look nervous.
Are you excited?

17:45.073 --> 17:46.830
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:46.831 --> 17:49.650
So you'll shadow me for the
week, but don't sweat it.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.277
It's like every
other server job.

17:51.629 --> 17:53.868
Well, I've actually never
been a waitress before.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.833
This is kind of like
a new beginning for me.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.371
- What were you doing before?
- Pharmaceutical sales.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.454
Fancy.

18:02.507 --> 18:04.044
You must have made bank.

18:04.331 --> 18:09.128
- What happened?
- Um, just, you know, Obamacare.

18:14.852 --> 18:18.137
Welcome to Steel
Mountain's data center.

18:18.189 --> 18:20.856
Our facility meets
diamond specifications

18:20.892 --> 18:24.226
and features a tier 10
certified build and design,

18:24.278 --> 18:27.396
providing you with a
safe, rock-solid fortress

18:27.448 --> 18:29.031
for your data needs.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.150
All of our
facilities implement

18:31.202 --> 18:32.651
comprehensive
security measures...

18:32.703 --> 18:36.038
They say I'm overdoing
it, and I say exactly.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.407
So yeah.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.959
Elliot.

18:40.011 --> 18:41.794
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

18:41.846 --> 18:45.214
- Tell your wife I said hi.
- I will.

18:45.216 --> 18:47.283
Those men I just
shook hands with,

18:47.318 --> 18:50.603
financiers of
Hezbollah and ISIS.

18:50.638 --> 18:52.855
I wouldn't stare.

18:52.890 --> 18:54.807
Did he know
I was gonna be here?

18:54.859 --> 18:56.475
Does he know why I'm here?

18:56.527 --> 18:58.728
Shit, he's gonna kill me.

18:58.730 --> 19:04.150
- As you were saying?
- Just a routine data process check.

19:04.202 --> 19:07.319
Allsafe does them
all the time.

19:07.372 --> 19:09.455
But why would they send you?

19:09.490 --> 19:11.374
That type of thing
isn't usually handled

19:11.409 --> 19:13.459
by the engineers, is it?

19:13.794 --> 19:17.046
We've been overlapping
a lot in our duties.

19:17.098 --> 19:19.848
Budget reasons.

19:19.884 --> 19:24.303
It seems we both had the
idea to work off-site today.

19:24.355 --> 19:26.605
Let's call this fortuitous.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.927
- Join me for lunch?
- S-sure.

19:32.613 --> 19:35.147
I eat lunch.

19:35.199 --> 19:37.950
So you are like
the rest of us.

19:40.321 --> 19:41.403
Come.

19:44.575 --> 19:45.741
He got owned, man.

19:45.776 --> 19:47.776
We got to go.

19:47.812 --> 19:48.812
We're not going anywhere.

19:48.846 --> 19:51.280
This changes nothing.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.165
What can I get you, Elliot?

19:53.217 --> 19:54.500
Have a lot of things here.

19:54.552 --> 19:55.913
He has
a vulnerability.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.337
He's an arrogant prick,
and he's proud of it.

19:58.389 --> 20:00.506
He cares what you
think about him,

20:00.558 --> 20:02.141
even though he probably
hates that he does.

20:02.176 --> 20:05.060
Tyrell Wellick's greatest
asset is his hubris,

20:05.096 --> 20:07.679
but it's also his flaw,
and that's your exploit.

20:07.732 --> 20:08.680
Would be nice.

20:08.733 --> 20:10.733
You eat here?

20:12.737 --> 20:15.537
This place?

20:15.573 --> 20:17.773
Is that your
plan, to piss him off?

20:17.808 --> 20:19.575
No, wait, man. Wait.

20:21.687 --> 20:22.738
_

20:25.649 --> 20:26.698
Now remember, Elliot,

20:26.751 --> 20:29.368
you'll lose our
signal on Level 2.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.120
Elliot.

20:32.289 --> 20:35.290
Elliot, say something
if you can hear us.

20:40.965 --> 20:43.882
I'm impressed you came
all the way out here.

20:43.934 --> 20:47.719
Allsafe is finished,
but you won't let it die.

20:47.772 --> 20:49.521
We're the same.

20:49.557 --> 20:51.056
We're perfectionists.

20:59.650 --> 21:02.484
I've seen our waiter
here for the last...

21:02.536 --> 21:04.820
seven years.

21:04.872 --> 21:08.073
Must be in his 50s,
maybe has kids,

21:08.125 --> 21:10.993
divorced, second
wife, more kids,

21:10.995 --> 21:12.628
and I wonder,

21:12.663 --> 21:15.497
what must he think of himself?

21:15.499 --> 21:17.499
His life's potential reached

21:17.551 --> 21:19.551
at a 30 grand a year salary,

21:19.587 --> 21:22.504
an economy car he
still owes money on,

21:22.556 --> 21:24.556
two-bedroom apartment,

21:24.592 --> 21:28.093
child support, coupons.

21:28.145 --> 21:30.179
I couldn't bear it,

21:30.231 --> 21:32.931
a life like that.

21:32.983 --> 21:35.100
The life of an
ordinary cockroach

21:35.152 --> 21:38.270
whose biggest value
is to serve me salad.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.530
I have to go to the bathroom.

22:47.525 --> 22:49.024
Goddamn
withdrawals again.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.859
Or is it Tyrell Wellick?

22:50.895 --> 22:51.894
Is he toying with me?

22:51.896 --> 22:53.896
What kind of game
are we playing?

22:57.451 --> 22:58.784
Am I his malware?

23:49.203 --> 23:51.537
I had to wash my face.

23:51.589 --> 23:54.089
Hard to breathe...

23:54.125 --> 23:55.340
here.

23:55.376 --> 23:57.626
I know you framed Terry Colby.

23:59.964 --> 24:01.096
I-I didn't.

24:01.132 --> 24:03.465
Your father worked at
Evil Corp before he died.

24:03.517 --> 24:05.517
That's a matter
of public record.

24:17.314 --> 24:20.365
I'm not turning you in, if
that's what you're thinking.

24:20.401 --> 24:22.785
I don't even have proof,

24:22.820 --> 24:25.237
and even if I did,
I don't care.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.623
Just wanted to know
your weakness.

24:27.658 --> 24:30.325
Now I do.

24:30.377 --> 24:32.161
Revenge.

24:34.165 --> 24:36.665
How ordinary.

24:36.717 --> 24:39.501
Just like our waiter.

24:39.553 --> 24:41.753
But even extraordinary people,

24:41.806 --> 24:43.505
and I believe you are,

24:43.507 --> 24:45.891
are driven by
human banalities.

24:45.926 --> 24:49.011
And unfortunately,
we're all human.

24:49.013 --> 24:51.013
Except me, of course.

24:54.568 --> 24:56.351
I'm joking, Elliot.

24:56.353 --> 25:00.155
Enjoy your long
drive back home.

25:00.191 --> 25:02.878
I'm having a helicopter
take me back to New York.

25:04.078 --> 25:05.744
You take care, Elliot.

25:37.249 --> 25:41.319
_

25:41.398 --> 25:44.891
_

25:49.344 --> 25:50.819
_

25:54.706 --> 25:57.410
_

25:57.669 --> 25:59.203
No. Bullshit.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.684
Dude, bullshit!

26:01.685 --> 26:03.140
- What did they say?
- I don't know.

26:03.176 --> 26:05.342
Basically that they're a
bunch of dickless assholes.

26:05.378 --> 26:07.044
- Where are you going?
- To fix it.

26:07.079 --> 26:09.413
No one else is going to.

26:09.465 --> 26:11.465
Darlene, wait.

26:14.837 --> 26:16.921
I really don't think you
should keep pushing them.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.088
Put it this way.

26:18.141 --> 26:21.142
Either I'm fixing
this or breaking it.

26:21.177 --> 26:22.593
Their call.

26:34.657 --> 26:37.107
Hi, Pumpkin.

26:37.109 --> 26:38.909
Hey, Daddy.

26:38.945 --> 26:43.477
- Why aren't you at work?
- I broke up with Ollie.

26:43.866 --> 26:45.115
I know.

26:45.117 --> 26:47.835
Just got off the
phone with him.

26:47.870 --> 26:49.003
Come on.

26:49.038 --> 26:51.455
He was sobbing.

26:51.457 --> 26:53.841
He wanted me to tell
you something like,

26:53.876 --> 26:55.626
"I'll always love you.

26:55.628 --> 26:56.877
Please come back."

26:56.929 --> 27:00.714
And he can learn to forgive you.

27:00.766 --> 27:03.684
Jesus.

27:03.719 --> 27:05.841
- What did you say?
- I told him I thought you

27:05.842 --> 27:08.399
should've broken up with him a
long time ago and hung up on him.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.975
Nice.

27:11.027 --> 27:17.778
- What did he mean, anyway?
- Just normal work and...

27:18.784 --> 27:20.284
money stuff.

27:22.288 --> 27:25.739
And, well, he cheated on me,

27:25.791 --> 27:27.157
so there's that.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.411
Well, the cheating part,
I'm not surprised.

27:32.415 --> 27:35.165
Not trying to make you feel
bad, honey, but come on.

27:35.167 --> 27:36.834
The kid's a douchebag.

27:39.171 --> 27:41.505
- As for the money...
- Dad, no.

27:41.507 --> 27:44.508
I'll float you some money
for professional development.

27:44.510 --> 27:47.511
- Dad...
- Call it a loan,

27:47.513 --> 27:50.431
but do not pay me back.

27:50.483 --> 27:51.849
And you'll stay
here and commute

27:51.901 --> 27:53.517
until you can save
for an apartment.

27:53.519 --> 27:55.185
I can't make you
do any of that.

27:55.238 --> 27:57.071
And you didn't.

27:57.106 --> 27:59.657
It's what I want.

27:59.692 --> 28:02.887
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

28:02.888 --> 28:04.161
No, no. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

28:04.196 --> 28:05.863
Relax.

28:05.915 --> 28:09.199
- What would you like?
- You don't need to cook for me, Dad.

28:09.252 --> 28:12.419
French toast coming up!

28:16.876 --> 28:19.077
_

28:19.101 --> 28:21.701
_

28:24.190 --> 28:25.447
_

28:28.534 --> 28:30.959
_

28:32.284 --> 28:34.350
_

28:38.691 --> 28:39.891
_

28:39.915 --> 28:41.915
_

28:42.939 --> 28:46.339
_

28:47.063 --> 28:48.763
_

28:50.787 --> 28:54.787
_

28:54.811 --> 28:56.411
_

28:56.435 --> 28:59.835
_

28:59.859 --> 29:03.459
_

29:09.230 --> 29:12.630
_

29:13.654 --> 29:15.654
_

29:18.478 --> 29:20.378
_

29:26.329 --> 29:29.663
Why are they backing out?

29:29.699 --> 29:30.998
This is a library.

29:31.033 --> 29:33.617
You want to discuss that,
go back to the IRC island.

29:33.669 --> 29:35.953
They banned me
from the channel!

29:36.005 --> 29:37.121
What happened?

29:37.173 --> 29:38.622
We just owned Steel Mountain.

29:38.624 --> 29:40.207
We did our part, and
it went perfect.

29:40.259 --> 29:42.009
Come on, we both know that
shit didn't go perfect.

29:42.044 --> 29:44.261
Well, it doesn't matter!
They called it off.

29:44.296 --> 29:45.879
We pulled our side together,

29:45.931 --> 29:47.848
and your side called it
off like it was nothing.

29:47.883 --> 29:49.633
You got your answer.

29:49.635 --> 29:53.137
You better tell your pal
whiterose to stop being a pussy

29:53.139 --> 29:54.688
and start growing a pair

29:54.724 --> 29:56.974
because we don't have time
to dilly-dally around...

29:56.976 --> 30:00.728
And now you're gonna talk
about this in the world?

30:00.780 --> 30:03.614
Do you even care
who hears you?

30:03.649 --> 30:05.315
Face it, Darlene.

30:05.317 --> 30:06.900
It's over.

30:06.952 --> 30:09.403
Walk away.

30:09.455 --> 30:11.655
I can't go back to
my people with that.

30:11.707 --> 30:13.874
Tell me why.

30:13.909 --> 30:17.578
You said the Dark Army
was with us on this.

30:21.417 --> 30:25.052
- Between us?
- I'm not about to goddamn tweet about it.

30:28.507 --> 30:32.843
They were out before you
ever got to Steel Mountain.

30:32.845 --> 30:35.179
I don't know why. That's
all they said to me.

30:36.766 --> 30:38.432
I know you had your heart set,

30:38.484 --> 30:39.850
but for real this time,

30:39.852 --> 30:42.736
just let it go.

31:02.664 --> 31:03.997
- I need seats mostly.
- No.

31:03.998 --> 31:06.100
I imagine it must be exciting
to work in government.

31:06.136 --> 31:08.169
It's like a spy movie.

31:08.463 --> 31:11.639
- Can you read my secret emails?
- No.

31:11.874 --> 31:14.508
My job is mostly paperwork
and bureaucracy.

31:14.544 --> 31:17.945
They always want more
than the technology allows.

31:17.981 --> 31:20.414
I don't even have time to
read your secret emails.

31:20.450 --> 31:22.617
But it's a stopgap for me.

31:22.652 --> 31:23.784
I'm restless.

31:23.820 --> 31:26.120
I'm always itching
for something else.

31:26.155 --> 31:28.322
There have been a lot
of something elses.

31:29.359 --> 31:30.391
For both of us.

31:31.995 --> 31:34.195
Before this, I
worked at an NGO,

31:34.230 --> 31:37.398
and before that, I worked
at Microsoft for a year,

31:37.433 --> 31:40.134
which felt like a decade.

31:44.574 --> 31:47.375
Your place is beautiful.

31:47.410 --> 31:49.210
I wish I could take
the compliment.

31:49.245 --> 31:51.245
The decorating is
Scott's domain.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.880
- Really?
- Yes.

31:52.915 --> 31:55.216
- Very nice.
- Yeah.

31:55.251 --> 31:58.819
- Where's all the... the antiques from?
- They're...

31:58.855 --> 32:01.722
So they tapped you
for CTO, yes?

32:01.758 --> 32:03.057
They're 17th century.

32:03.092 --> 32:05.726
Don't be surprised.

32:05.762 --> 32:08.596
Suspicious is more accurate.

32:08.631 --> 32:12.800
I was beginning to wonder
why you set this dinner.

32:12.835 --> 32:15.536
Four people in the world

32:15.571 --> 32:17.605
know about my conversations.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.942
Somehow you're number five.

32:21.978 --> 32:26.414
Then I'm exactly what
you need in a right hand.

32:26.449 --> 32:29.450
So that's what this is about.

32:29.485 --> 32:31.385
Isn't everything
about something?

32:31.421 --> 32:34.021
Like, we were thinking
about, is it is it babyproof?

32:34.057 --> 32:36.791
Yeah, that's...
that's a consideration.

32:36.826 --> 32:39.093
If you were me,

32:39.128 --> 32:44.165
- would you trust you as your right hand?
- If I were you,

32:44.200 --> 32:48.302
I wouldn't have even
let me in the house.

32:49.572 --> 32:52.339
We finished
everything upstairs...

33:05.788 --> 33:06.754
Hey.

33:06.789 --> 33:08.122
Hey, it's me.

33:08.374 --> 33:11.659
- Is now a good time?
- Yeah.

33:11.660 --> 33:13.094
I'm at my new job.

33:13.744 --> 33:17.131
- How's it going?
- Seriously, it's hard as hell,

33:17.183 --> 33:19.633
but I am getting
the hang of it.

33:19.635 --> 33:21.969
At first, it took me, like,
years to marry ketchups,

33:21.971 --> 33:23.721
but it turns out I'm amazing

33:23.773 --> 33:26.640
at upselling
expensive cocktails.

33:26.692 --> 33:28.225
I'm not surprised.

33:28.277 --> 33:30.478
And then when I have to
put together to go orders,

33:30.480 --> 33:33.147
it's like bagging molly, so
I'm, like, kind of an expert.

33:33.149 --> 33:37.318
- How are you?
- I'm good.

33:38.371 --> 33:39.703
Wow, I've never heard you say

33:39.739 --> 33:42.123
a sentence like
that before, ever.

33:43.326 --> 33:46.210
I did what I had to do today.

33:46.245 --> 33:48.796
Well, if you're
around tonight,

33:48.831 --> 33:51.165
come over and tell
me about it, okay?

33:51.217 --> 33:53.584
I got to go.

33:53.636 --> 33:54.969
Okay, bye.

34:08.568 --> 34:11.185
You seem to know how
to drink your wine.

34:13.356 --> 34:16.857
I indulge in few things,
but I do love wine.

34:16.909 --> 34:19.853
- Yourself?
- In my other life,

34:19.855 --> 34:21.862
when I could drink for one.

34:21.914 --> 34:24.697
But even then I
had cheap tastes.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.867
It's safe to smell, though.

34:26.918 --> 34:28.002
Put your nose in there.

34:28.036 --> 34:32.623
♪ Mean a thing to me ♪

34:32.675 --> 34:34.395
You know, to me, it
smells like every wine.

34:35.878 --> 34:39.380
But I'd love to learn.

34:39.431 --> 34:44.051
Dried red fruit, fresh violet,

34:44.053 --> 34:46.719
lemon peel.

34:46.722 --> 34:47.855
Try it again.

34:47.889 --> 34:52.393
Smell and really...
really think about it.

34:52.445 --> 34:55.396
I do smell lemon.

34:55.398 --> 34:57.148
- Sharon?
- Yeah?

34:57.200 --> 35:00.034
How do you not blow your brains
out being married to him?

35:00.069 --> 35:01.485
Smell again.

35:01.537 --> 35:03.404
Excuse me?

35:03.406 --> 35:08.742
- Shall I repeat the question?
- You're a guest in our house.

35:08.744 --> 35:12.413
A very honest one.

35:12.465 --> 35:14.331
Wow.

35:15.835 --> 35:20.554
I think I'll mistake what you
said as a joke in poor taste

35:20.590 --> 35:23.174
and excuse myself
to the bathroom.

35:25.595 --> 35:28.145
I have a beautiful
vintage over here.

35:28.181 --> 35:31.315
I would love to just
show you the label.

35:40.493 --> 35:42.159
Nope.

35:42.195 --> 35:44.411
There's the one.

35:44.447 --> 35:47.498
This is my prized
possession, actually.

35:47.533 --> 35:48.866
Take a look at this.

35:48.918 --> 35:50.421

35:53.122 --> 35:56.090
I'm in here.

35:56.525 --> 35:58.692
Can I help you?

36:38.467 --> 36:40.767
Thank you for a
lovely evening.

37:01.554 --> 37:05.090
- Siege in Stormstout!
- Carcass Emblem!

37:06.726 --> 37:08.159
We got problems.

37:08.195 --> 37:10.960
- Is the Pi online?
- Yeah, we're in the whole system.

37:10.961 --> 37:13.242
We could deliver the whole
payload right now if we wanted.

37:14.568 --> 37:16.151
And yet I hear no applause.

37:16.186 --> 37:18.186
Applaud.

37:22.993 --> 37:24.142
You have to tell them.

37:26.428 --> 37:29.814
- What?
- We lost China.

37:29.850 --> 37:33.184
- I'm sorry?
- The Dark Army is bailing.

37:34.151 --> 37:37.554
- Why?
- They don't answer whys apparently.

37:39.226 --> 37:40.625
That's no problem.
We'll just call 'em back.

37:40.677 --> 37:42.735
- We'll set up another meet ASAP...
- Dude, did you not hear me?

37:42.736 --> 37:45.130
They've gone dark.
It's not happening.

37:53.773 --> 37:55.356
I know. I know.

37:55.392 --> 37:58.176
I get it, okay? I fucked up.

38:09.239 --> 38:10.989
Let's not wait, then.

38:11.041 --> 38:13.208
Let's do it anyway, just us.

38:13.243 --> 38:14.959
Let's do it right now.

38:14.995 --> 38:16.661
Okay? We execute now.

38:16.713 --> 38:18.713
We execute on our side and
trust that the Dark Army

38:18.715 --> 38:20.165
gets their shit
together and follows.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.833
Why do they get
to dictate terms?

38:21.885 --> 38:22.834
We dictate terms!

38:22.886 --> 38:24.219
We can go now.

38:24.254 --> 38:25.386
If we move forward
and they don't,

38:25.422 --> 38:27.589
China still holds all
the redundant information.

38:27.641 --> 38:28.723
It will be pointless.

38:28.758 --> 38:31.509
And if we wait, it'll
also be pointless.

38:31.511 --> 38:34.062
Everything you guys did
today would be for nothing.

38:36.433 --> 38:39.234
God, are you crazy?

38:39.269 --> 38:41.819
It will have no effect!

38:41.855 --> 38:43.354
It'll take down their
network for weeks.

38:43.406 --> 38:44.439
They'll recover.

38:44.491 --> 38:45.523
It would still hurt them.

38:45.575 --> 38:46.941
We don't want to hurt them!

38:46.993 --> 38:49.194
We want to kill them!

38:49.246 --> 38:52.080
And neither will happen
if we do nothing right now.

38:53.333 --> 38:58.286
- What are you doing?
- Take another step, and I'll do it.

39:00.207 --> 39:02.090
Think about what
you're doing, okay?

39:02.125 --> 39:03.458
All right?

39:03.510 --> 39:05.543
In a month, they're gonna
be up and running again

39:05.595 --> 39:06.878
with even better security.

39:06.930 --> 39:08.570
We are not gonna get
another shot at this.

39:08.598 --> 39:10.965
The revolution that
we've always talked about

39:11.017 --> 39:13.384
will be gone,
dead, and buried.

39:13.386 --> 39:18.139
We will have failed
because of you.

39:18.191 --> 39:21.893
Please do not do this.

39:29.653 --> 39:30.652
Is there anyone here

39:30.704 --> 39:32.904
who can communicate
with this woman?

39:57.480 --> 39:59.430
Please.

39:59.432 --> 40:02.600
Tell me it's okay to execute.

40:20.587 --> 40:23.688
But we were so close.

40:32.732 --> 40:34.832
It's not over.

40:34.868 --> 40:36.034
We'll rework it.

40:36.069 --> 40:37.735
We'll figure something out.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.771
We got this far.

40:41.641 --> 40:44.809
We'll find a way,
just not tonight.

40:57.290 --> 41:00.658
This is all my fault.

41:02.162 --> 41:04.078
Come on.

41:04.130 --> 41:06.130
You can crash at my place.

41:17.143 --> 41:19.227
My father picked
me up from school one day,

41:19.262 --> 41:22.680
and we played hooky and
went to the beach.

41:22.716 --> 41:24.248
It was too cold to
go in the water,

41:24.284 --> 41:28.319
so we sat on a blanket
and ate pizza.

41:28.355 --> 41:30.788
When I got home, my
sneakers were full of sand,

41:30.824 --> 41:33.758
and I dumped it on
my bedroom floor.

41:33.793 --> 41:35.159
I didn't know the difference.

41:35.195 --> 41:36.861
I was six.

41:36.896 --> 41:38.529
My mother screamed
at me for the mess,

41:38.565 --> 41:40.415
but he wasn't mad.

41:40.450 --> 41:42.700
He said that billions
of years ago,

41:42.702 --> 41:45.036
the world shifting and
the oceans moving

41:45.038 --> 41:47.171
brought that sand to
that spot on the beach,

41:47.207 --> 41:49.173
and then I took it away.

41:49.209 --> 41:50.341
"Every day," he said,

41:50.377 --> 41:52.960
"we change the world,"
which is a nice thought

41:53.012 --> 41:55.546
until I think about how
many days and lifetimes

41:55.548 --> 41:58.049
I would need to bring
a shoe full of sand home

41:58.051 --> 41:59.784
until there is no beach,

41:59.819 --> 42:02.186
until it made a
difference to anyone.

42:03.189 --> 42:04.889
Every day, we
change the world,

42:04.941 --> 42:07.725
but to change the world in
a way that means anything,

42:07.777 --> 42:10.561
that takes more time
than most people have.

42:10.563 --> 42:12.897
It never happens all at once.

42:15.068 --> 42:16.150
It's slow.

42:16.202 --> 42:17.618
It's methodical.

42:17.654 --> 42:20.822
It's exhausting.

42:20.874 --> 42:22.874
We don't all have
the stomach for it.

42:49.002 --> 42:54.305
- Hey, sweetie.
- I'm gonna go for a run.

42:55.308 --> 42:56.874
Nice.

43:06.953 --> 43:09.504
Shayla's got the dog.

43:09.539 --> 43:12.957
She doesn't shit
on her pillows.

43:12.959 --> 43:14.709
That's a plus, I guess.

43:29.392 --> 43:32.977
- Shayla?
- Hey, brah.

43:33.029 --> 43:36.531
Sometimes the universe
aligns perfectly.

43:36.566 --> 43:39.033
Here I am, locked away.

43:39.068 --> 43:42.537
Still, it brings
you right to me.
