12:39.893 --> 12:41.829
- I'M SORRY, BABY.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.131
I'M SO SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.

12:44.164 --> 12:48.869
- ME TOO. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHOSE FAULT IT WAS.

12:48.902 --> 12:53.773
- NOW ALL THAT MATTERS...
IS THIS.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.478
[door opening]

12:58.511 --> 13:01.348
- OUI?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.515
- "WE"?

13:02.549 --> 13:03.750
- NON.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.119
"OUI" AS IN, "IS THERE
SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE?"

13:06.153 --> 13:07.988
- UH, ACTUALLY...

13:08.021 --> 13:09.857
YES.
I'D LIKE TO SEE LINDSAY.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.424
- AH, LINDSAY IS NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.326
SHE'S TEACHING CLASS.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.561
- AND WHO ARE YOU?

13:14.594 --> 13:17.164
- I AM GUILLAUME.
AND YOU ARE?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.066
- MELANIE.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.368
- AH, MELANIE,
THE EX-GIRLFRIEND.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.070
- YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

13:23.103 --> 13:25.572
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO HAD THE AFFAIR.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.375
OF COURSE IN FRANCE,
THIS WOULD BE MEANINGLESS.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.911
- I-I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE TOLD YOU THAT.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.581
- LINDSAY AND I ARE VERY,
UH, INTIM--

13:34.614 --> 13:36.283
INTIMATE.
- I GOT IT.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.285
LOOK, I STOPPED BY
TO SEE MY SON.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.619
- MMM. I-I'M AFRAID
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.054
IT'S HIS FEEDING TIME.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.890
- WELL, I COULD DO--
NO, NO, NO. NO.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.258
- I WILL DO IT.
HE GETS VERY, UM...

13:45.292 --> 13:47.327
WHAT YOU CALL IT?
UH, FINICKY.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.296
- OKAY, WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU ANYWAY,

13:49.329 --> 13:52.499
AND WHY HASN'T LINDSAY
EVER TOLD ME ABOUT YOU?

13:52.532 --> 13:53.934
- PERHAPS IT'S HER DECISION,

13:53.967 --> 13:55.335
NOW THAT YOU'RE
NO LONGER LIVING TOGETHER,

13:55.368 --> 13:57.104
NOT TO SHARE WITH YOU
ALL THE DETAILS OF HER LIFE.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.538
[Gus crying]
THIS IS NORMAL.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.240
I'M ON MY WAY,
MON PETIT CHOU.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.176
SO, I TELL HER YOU STOP BY.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.192
- WHY WOULD DAVID KEEP
TAKING MY CHECKS

14:19.226 --> 14:21.194
IF HE HAS NO INTENTION
OF CASHING THEM?

14:21.228 --> 14:23.296
- WELL, MAYBE HE'S WAITING
UNTIL NEXT QUARTER

14:23.330 --> 14:24.932
WHEN HE HAS LESS
TAX LIABILITY.

14:24.965 --> 14:25.732
- [snickering]

14:25.765 --> 14:26.766
- SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE ACCOUNTANT.

14:26.799 --> 14:29.336
- OR MAYBE HE'S JUST
TAKING THEM TO HUMOR YOU.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.305
- WELL, I'M NOT AMUSED.
I CAN PAY MY OWN WAY.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.942
- VERY NOBLE.
- YEAH, AND STUPID!

14:34.975 --> 14:36.343
- MICHAEL, SWEETIE,

14:36.376 --> 14:40.647
IT'S EVERY GAY BOY'S DREAM
TO BE A KEPT WOMAN.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.983
[yells of protest]
- WHAT'S SHE DOING IN HERE?

14:43.016 --> 14:44.217
- OH, CHRIST!

14:44.251 --> 14:45.485
DO YOU THINK I'VE NEVER SEEN
A DICK BEFORE?

14:45.518 --> 14:46.653
- NOT MINE!

14:46.686 --> 14:48.221
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY, EVERYONE.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.222
SHE'S A LESBIAN.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.357
- OH, SHE'S A DYKE.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.225
- MELANIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.394
- I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
AND I WENT TO GO SEE LINDSAY.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.463
UH, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO HER?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.065
- A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.666
- DID SHE MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT A FRENCH GUY?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.268
- NO.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.070
- A FRENCH GUY?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.571
- I WENT OVER TO SEE HER,

15:04.604 --> 15:06.006
AND THIS FUCKING FROG
ANSWERED THE DOOR.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.374
- SO?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.976
- SO WHEN I TRIED
TO SEE GUS,

15:09.009 --> 15:11.044
HE SLAMMED THE GODDAMN DOOR
IN MY FACE.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.245
- WELL, EVERYBODY KNOWS

15:12.279 --> 15:13.513
THE FRENCH ARE FAMOUS
FOR ECLAIRS,

15:13.546 --> 15:15.248
ORAL SEX, AND RUDENESS.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.350
- I ONCE HAD A DATE
THAT INVOLVED ALL THREE.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.719
- MAYBE SHE JUST GOT HERSELF
A NEW BABYSITTER.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.354
- FROM FRANCE?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.190
- A LITTLE PRICEY
ON HER TEACHER'S SALARY.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.391
- AND HOW COME
SHE DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT IT?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.293
- [on voice mail] BONJOUR.
- H-HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.228
- YOU HAVE REACHED LINDSAY
AND GUILLAUME

15:28.261 --> 15:29.496
AND BEAUTIFUL BABY GUS.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.733
IF YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR US,
KINDLY LEAVE IT AFTER THE BEEP.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.468
- "US."

15:35.502 --> 15:37.570
- IT'S PRETTY PUSHY
FOR THE HELP.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.339
- IT MAKES IT SOUND
LIKE THEY'RE A COUPLE.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.709
- QUELQUE CHOSE
ISN'T KOSHER.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.614
[knocking]

15:47.647 --> 15:50.283
- HEY.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.986
[door closing]

15:53.020 --> 15:55.322
YOU KNOW THE LAST TIME
I BROUGHT HOT CHOCOLATE

15:55.355 --> 15:57.757
AND FIG NEWTONS UP HERE?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.326
- WHEN MICHAEL LIVED HERE?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.661
- SMART KID. HMM.

16:01.694 --> 16:05.365
HE'D LOCK HIMSELF IN HERE
FOR HOURS AND HOURS.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.001
TOLD ME HE WAS PLAYING
WITH HIS MODEL AIRPLANES.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.137
HA!
I KNOW WHAT HE WAS PLAYING WITH.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.439
[snort, chuckle]

16:12.472 --> 16:16.076
HERE.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.211
YOU WANT ONE?

16:18.245 --> 16:20.713
- NO, THANKS.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.216
- IT'S A LOUSY THING
THAT TEACHER DID,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.385
HAVING YOU SUSPENDED.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.122
- YEAH, I COULD PUNCH
DICKHEAD DIXON'S FACE IN.

16:29.156 --> 16:32.625
CHRIS HOBBS' TOO.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.428
- ONLY THEN,
YOU'D BE JUST LIKE THEM.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.430
- SO WHAT?

16:37.464 --> 16:41.534
THEY DESERVE IT.
- SURE THEY DO.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.770
BUT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS
OF HANDLING IT.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.506
- HMM, QUIT SCHOOL?

16:46.539 --> 16:50.777
- AND GIVE THEM THE PLEASURE?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.313
HMM?

16:56.716 --> 17:00.453
YOU KNOW...

17:00.487 --> 17:02.389
THERE WERE PEOPLE...

17:02.422 --> 17:06.126
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
THAT MICHAEL WAS GAY...

17:06.159 --> 17:09.729
WHO SAID AND DID
THE CRUELEST THINGS.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.132
FRIENDS...

17:12.165 --> 17:14.067
NEIGHBORS...

17:14.101 --> 17:15.668
FAMILY.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.604
MY OWN GODDAMN SISTER
WOULDN'T EVEN

17:17.637 --> 17:20.440
LET HER KIDS COME OVER HERE.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.142
SHE WAS AFRAID MICHAEL
WAS GOING TO MOLEST THEM

17:22.175 --> 17:24.277
OR SOMETHING.

17:24.311 --> 17:26.246
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE WAY PEOPLE ARE.

17:26.279 --> 17:30.783
THEY'RE IGNORANT
AND THEY'RE SCARED.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.254
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO...

17:34.287 --> 17:38.725
EXCEPT EDUCATE 'EM
OR SHOOT 'EM.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.693
ME, I JOINED P-FLAG,
'CAUSE I FIGURED

17:40.727 --> 17:42.662
IT WAS MORE PRACTICAL
THAN SHOOTING 'EM.

17:42.695 --> 17:47.800
[chuckles]

17:47.834 --> 17:50.670
DO YOU HAVE A GAY CLUB
AT YOUR SCHOOL?

17:50.703 --> 17:53.640
- [laughs]
ARE YOU CRAZY?

17:53.673 --> 17:56.443
- I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF IT.

17:56.476 --> 18:01.814
- NO. I'M, LIKE,
THE ONLY GAY STUDENT THERE.

18:01.848 --> 18:05.818
- I DOUBT THAT, SUNSHINE.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.856
GAY KIDS ARE EVERYWHERE.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.892
ONLY THEY'RE NOT
ALL LIKE YOU...

18:12.925 --> 18:18.865
'CAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID
TO SHOW THEIR FACES.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.801
THAT'S WHY MAYBE...

18:21.834 --> 18:24.537
YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
TO HELP THEM KNOW THAT...

18:24.571 --> 18:29.842
THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.146
- I DIDN'T CASH YOUR CHECKS
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY.

18:33.180 --> 18:37.317
- BUT I NEED
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.885
- MICHAEL, YOU KNOW,
OF COURSE,

18:38.918 --> 18:42.355
THAT HALF THE MONTHLY EXPENSES
AREN'T REALLY $300.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.657
- OF COURSE I KNOW,
AND I'M SURE WHATEVER IT IS,

18:44.691 --> 18:46.793
I COULDN'T AFFORD IT,
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.262
UH, I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.298
- AND YOU DO.
YOU DO.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.765
YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING
MUCH MORE VALUABLE THAN MONEY.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.267
YOU GIVE ME YOUR SWEETNESS,

18:54.301 --> 18:57.604
YOUR CHARM, YOUR HUMOR,
YOUR HOT LITTLE BOD.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.273
I MEAN, WHAT'S PAYING
HALF THE GAS AND ELECTRIC

19:00.307 --> 19:03.310
COMPARED TO THAT, MICHAEL?

19:03.343 --> 19:05.878
- I'M NOT SOME BOY TOY
YOU'RE KEEPING.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.581
- I'VE NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU
AS MY BOY TOY.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.817
DON'T INSULT ME.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.486
- I'LL TAKE THAT.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.255
- OKAY.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.489
OKAY, WHATEVER
WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.890
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.693
- WHAT WILL MAKE ME HAPPY
IS IF YOU...

19:20.727 --> 19:23.930
TAKE MY MONEY AND YOU STOP
PAYING FOR EVERYTHING.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.399
- FINE. FROM NOW ON,
WE'LL ONLY DO THINGS

19:26.433 --> 19:30.503
THAT WE CAN BOTH AFFORD
TO DO TOGETHER.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.843
[sigh]
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING.

19:36.876 --> 19:40.580
- WHAT'S THAT?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.781
- DON'T GET MAD.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.383
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A SURPRISE.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.651
BUT YOU KNOW THE--
[clears throat]

19:44.684 --> 19:46.553
THE WEEK THAT YOU HAVE OFF
FROM WORK?

19:46.586 --> 19:49.889
I CLEARED IT FOR ME TOO,
AND I POPPED FOR...

19:49.922 --> 19:51.491
A TRIP TO PARIS.

19:51.524 --> 19:55.828
FIRST CLASS,
SUITE AT THE HOTEL GEORGES V,

19:55.862 --> 20:00.433
RESERVATIONS AT ALL
THE FINEST RESTAURANTS.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.235
- WOW. THAT--

20:02.269 --> 20:04.304
THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.438
- I KNOW.
- BUT--

20:05.472 --> 20:07.740
- NO, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.342
[sighing]
IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO DO.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.578
I'LL, UH...
CANCEL IT TOMORROW.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.414
AND WE'LL JUST STAY HOME,
WATCH A MOVIE...

20:14.447 --> 20:17.550
OR TWO, EAT IN.

20:17.584 --> 20:22.489
AND THAT CAN STILL BE FUN.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.896
[doorbell ringing]

20:29.929 --> 20:31.998
- HI, LINDSAY.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.001
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND US
ALL DROPPING BY LIKE THIS.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.904
- ACTUALLY,
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.906
- WE DID,
AND GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

20:45.044 --> 20:48.281
[Gus fussing]

20:49.949 --> 20:54.987
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.525
AH. LOOK WHO ELSE IS HERE.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.826
- THIS IS GUILLAUME.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.761
I BELIEVE
YOU'VE MET MELANIE.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.963
- OUI.
MELANIE, COMMENT CA VA?

21:03.996 --> 21:05.865
UM, HOW ARE YOU?

21:05.898 --> 21:08.034
- UH, CA VA JUST FINE.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.637
- THIS IS BRIAN,
GUS' BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.505
- AH, OUI.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.073
OH. BE ASSURED, MY FRIEND,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.576
THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT GUS NOW THAT I'M HERE.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.978
- MM-HMM. I WASN'T WORRIED
WHEN YOU WEREN'T...

21:19.011 --> 21:20.046
MON AMI.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.515
- AND THIS IS TED AND EMMETT.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.050
- BONJOUR.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.084
- BONSOIR.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.486
- ENCHANTE.

21:26.519 --> 21:27.920
- WE WERE JUST IN THE MIDDLE
OF DINNER,

21:27.954 --> 21:29.522
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND...

21:29.556 --> 21:32.425
- UH, I-IF YOU WOULD LIKE,
YOUR FRIENDS MAY JOIN US.

21:32.459 --> 21:37.697
THERE'S ENOUGH...
RABBIT FOR EVERYONE.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.898
- RABBIT?

21:38.931 --> 21:41.934
- YES, I MADE A, UH, STEW.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.504
- WITH--WITH RABBIT?

21:44.537 --> 21:45.772
BUNNY RABBIT?

21:45.805 --> 21:47.740
- THEY SAY IT TASTES
JUST LIKE CHICKEN.

21:47.774 --> 21:51.811
- PLEASE,
UH, COME, TRY SOME.

21:51.844 --> 21:56.949
- WELL, MAYBE JUST A...
LITTLE TASTE.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.619
- I'M--I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY,
SO, UH...

22:03.055 --> 22:04.957
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.426
- YEAH.
WHO'S THIS GUY?

22:06.459 --> 22:07.994
- AND WHAT'S HE DOING
IN OUR HOUSE?

22:08.027 --> 22:09.896
- EXCUSE ME, I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR BARGING IN HERE

22:09.929 --> 22:11.063
AND INTERROGATING ME.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.965
- OH, WHOA.
WHO'S INTERROGATING YOU?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.368
- WE'RE JUST ASKING YOU.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.570
- GUILLAUME TEACHES FRENCH
AT THE UNIVERSITY.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.472
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.574
- YEAH, WELL, HOW COME
YOU NEVER MENTIONED HIM?

22:21.608 --> 22:22.575
- I DID.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.976
YOU JUST NEVER LISTENED.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.612
- [scoffs]

22:25.645 --> 22:28.648
- ANYWAY, HE NEEDED SOME HELP,
AND SO DID I.

22:28.681 --> 22:32.151
SO I SAID HE COULD MOVE IN.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.653
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

22:33.686 --> 22:36.923
- WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN
COMMUNICATING LATELY.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.891
- OH, MY GOD!

22:38.925 --> 22:40.727
THIS IS FABULOUS!
- MAGNIFIQUE!

22:40.760 --> 22:41.861
IT'S THE BEST RABBIT
I'VE EVER HAD.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.996
THE ONLY RABBIT
I'VE EVER HAD.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.933
- [cooing]

22:46.966 --> 22:51.471
- YEAH, HE'S A...
FANTASTIC COOK,

22:51.504 --> 22:53.172
AND HE'S WONDERFUL
WITH THE BABY.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.508
AND GUS TOOK TO HIM
IMMEDIATELY.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.143
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT A RELIEF IT IS

22:57.176 --> 22:59.746
HAVING HIM HELP
WITH THE MORTGAGE.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.649
- SOUNDS LIKE
THE PERFECT ARRANGEMENT.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.751
- SO HOW LONG IS HE STAYING?

23:04.784 --> 23:07.887
- THAT ALL DEPENDS.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.089
- UNTIL HE FINDS A PLACE
OF HIS OWN?

23:10.122 --> 23:13.159
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO RAISE RABBITS IN YOUR CONDO.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.094
- UNTIL...

23:15.127 --> 23:18.164
[nervous chuckle]
WE GET MARRIED.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.866
- WHAT?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.501
- [chuckles]

23:21.534 --> 23:22.569
- ARE YOU FUCKING NUTS?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.771
- DON'T GET SO EXCITED.
IT'S JUST AN ARRANGEMENT.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.439
I CAN GET SOME HELP,

23:26.473 --> 23:29.776
AND HE CAN STAY IN THE COUNTRY
AND GET HIS GREEN CARD.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.678
- ALORS, I MUST INSIST

23:31.711 --> 23:33.012
THAT YOU COME EAT
TOUT DE SUITE,

23:33.045 --> 23:37.717
OR ELSE IT GETS COLD.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.760
- THE WAY HE INSINUATED
HIMSELF...

23:47.794 --> 23:49.529
- RIGHT. LIKE--LIKE--
LIKE IT WAS HIS HOUSE...

23:49.562 --> 23:50.597
- THAT HE BELONGS THERE...

23:50.630 --> 23:52.198
- AND YOU AND I WERE LIKE
A COUPLE OF STRANGERS.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.833
I NEED A CIGARETTE BAD.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.468
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.804
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,
NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.005
- OH, MELANIE THE MARTYR.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.540
YOU WANT ME
TO SET YOU ON FIRE?

24:00.573 --> 24:03.676
- ASSHOLE, JUST GIMME A LIGHT.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.012
IF SHE GOES THROUGH
WITH THIS,

24:06.045 --> 24:08.815
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE THERE
FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF YEARS.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.950
- AND BY THEN GUS'LL BE
SMOKING GAULOISES AND...

24:10.983 --> 24:12.885
NOT WEARING DEODORANT.
- [chuckles]

24:12.919 --> 24:14.621
- AND SHE'LL HAVE MOVED ON
WITH HER LIFE.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.689
THERE'S NO WAY
WE'LL EVER GET BACK TOGETHER.

24:16.723 --> 24:17.924
- IF ONLY SHE KNEW

24:17.957 --> 24:19.726
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
SHE COULD GET INTO.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.028
WELL, KNOWING LINDSAY...
PROBABLY WOULDN'T CARE.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.831
SHE'S ALWAYS LOOKING OUT
FOR THE WELFARE OF OTHERS.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.098
- THE GENEROUS ONE.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.067
THEN THERE'S ME,
THE SELFISH ONE.

24:28.100 --> 24:32.939
I WANTED A FUCK, AND BOY,
DID I GET FUCKED.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.708
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH GETTING YOUR NEEDS MET.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.610
- THAT'S NO SURPRISE
COMING FROM YOU.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.245
IT'S YOUR MANIFESTO.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.813
- WELL, IT WOULD BE EVERYONE'S

24:40.847 --> 24:42.715
IF THEY WERE HONEST ENOUGH
TO ADMIT IT.

24:42.749 --> 24:46.218
SO STOP BLAMING YOURSELF.
IT'S BORING.

24:46.252 --> 24:49.756
AND YOU DON'T DESERVE IT.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.091
- HEY!
- HEY.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.793
ISN'T IT A SCHOOL NIGHT?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.294
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT DEB'S
STUDYING?

24:55.327 --> 24:58.030
- I GOT SUSPENDED.
- YOU?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.099
- FOR TWO DAYS.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.068
I SAW THIS STUDENT
GETTING BASHED,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.804
AND MY HOMOPHOBIC TEACHER
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT...

25:04.837 --> 25:06.739
SO I TOLD HIM TO FUCK OFF.

25:06.773 --> 25:09.108
[laughter]

25:09.141 --> 25:11.110
- GO TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.145
- THAT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.682
GETTING THE SHIT KICKED OUT
OF YOU ON THE PLAYGROUND.

25:15.715 --> 25:20.252
- MMM. HAVING LIT MATCHES THROWN
AT YOU IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

25:20.286 --> 25:24.624
GOOD TIMES.
- YEAH.

25:24.657 --> 25:28.227
I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYTHING LIKE
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.763
- WELL, ONCE THIS STRAIGHT
FOOTBALL JOCK PICKED ME UP

25:30.797 --> 25:33.833
AND DUNKED MY HEAD
IN THE TOILET.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.134
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

25:35.167 --> 25:37.136
- I FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS LOCKER.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.906
IT WAS OPEN, HIS HAND WAS UP
KIND OF LIKE THIS.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.774
HE WAS LAUGHING,

25:41.808 --> 25:44.310
SO I SLAMMED THE DOOR SO HARD
IT BROKE THREE OF HIS FINGERS.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.179
- OOH.
- MMM!

25:47.213 --> 25:50.617
- AND THAT WAS THE END
OF THE SEASON FOR HIM.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.125
- A GAY-STRAIGHT WHAT?
- STUDENT ALLIANCE.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.727
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.795
- IT'S A CLUB,

26:02.829 --> 26:06.633
A-A FORUM WHERE STUDENTS
DISCUSS ISSUES, PLAN EVENTS.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.335
YOU KNOW,
TO PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.204
- [sighing]
I'M ASLEEP ALREADY.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.807
- [slapping Brian's back]
I NEED YOUR EXPERTISE.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.143
- I THINK
I'VE GIVEN YOU PLENTY.

26:17.176 --> 26:22.048
- [grunts]
YOUR BUSINESS EXPERTISE.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.884
IT'S A TOUGH SELL,
ESPECIALLY AT ST. JAMES.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.220
SO, SAY I BROUGHT THIS CONCEPT
TO YOU AT YOUR OFFICE.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.957
HOW WOULD YOU MARKET IT?

26:30.990 --> 26:33.125
- IT'S 1:30
IN THE MORNING,

26:33.159 --> 26:36.062
AND I'M HORNY AS HELL.

26:36.095 --> 26:41.901
- PLEASE?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.403
- [sigh of resignation]
OKAY.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.938
[clears throat]

26:45.972 --> 26:48.775
YOU'RE THE CLIENT.

26:48.808 --> 26:53.312
HAVE A SEAT, MR. TAYLOR.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.714
[laughing]

26:54.747 --> 26:56.248
- WELL, WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

26:56.282 --> 26:58.951
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST
HOW I IMAGINE ALL MY CLIENTS.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.987
I PICTURE THEM NAKED.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.255
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M DOING THIS.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.224
OKAY.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.826
SO YOU HAVE THIS CONCEPT,

27:06.859 --> 27:09.962
THE GAY-STRAIGHT
STUDENT ALLIANCE.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.263
LET'S ALL LIVE TOGETHER.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.699
POWER TO THE PEOPLE.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.366
PEACE.
THAT'S BORING AS SHIT.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.003
- I COULD TAKE OUT AN UZI
AND SHOOT EVERYONE.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.404
THAT WOULD BE EXCITING.

27:18.437 --> 27:21.140
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'D GET THEIR ATTENTION.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.142
NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO SELL IT.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.344
- RIGHT. HOW?

27:25.377 --> 27:28.047
- THE SAME WAY YOU SELL
EVERYTHING ELSE.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.053
SEX.
- SEX.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.222
- YOU WANT TO GET 'EM
IN THE TENT,

27:36.255 --> 27:37.690
HAND OUT THESE.

27:37.724 --> 27:38.858
- CONDOMS?

27:38.891 --> 27:41.193
- YOU SAID IT WAS AN ALLIANCE.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.831
WHAT BETTER WAY FOR EVERYONE
TO COME TOGETHER?

27:50.803 --> 27:53.840
- HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU
TO PARIS?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.942
- HONEY, YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST BOY
IN THE WORLD.

27:55.975 --> 27:56.976
PASS ME THE SYRUP.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.410
I LOVE PARIS.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.179
- YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO PARIS.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.049
- WELL, I KNOW I'LL LOVE IT
WHEN I GET THERE.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.184
- SO WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?

28:05.217 --> 28:07.019
- WE'RE NOT.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.454
- EXCUSEZ-MOI?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.757
- I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
FOR THAT KIND OF A TRIP.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.825
- OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
BUT DAVID DOES.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.794
- I TOLD HIM I COULDN'T
LET HIM PAY FOR ME.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.463
- ARE YOU COMPLETELY MAD?

28:17.496 --> 28:18.731
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.967
- DAVID AND I HAVE
AN ARRANGEMENT.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.269
WE ONLY DO THINGS
THAT WE CAN BOTH AFFORD.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.838
- AU REVOIR, PARIS.
BONJOUR, PITTSBURGH.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.407
- ALL RIGHT, SO I WON'T GET
TO SEE THE SEINE AT SUNSET,

28:28.440 --> 28:31.277
OR--OR STROLL
THROUGH THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS,

28:31.310 --> 28:33.212
OR ANY OF THE OTHER WONDERFUL
STUFF HE HAD PLANNED,

28:33.245 --> 28:34.413
BUT AT LEAST--
- YOU'LL HAVE YOUR PRIDE?

28:34.446 --> 28:36.282
- AH. I HEAR IT'S WHAT
EVERYONE IS WEARING

28:36.315 --> 28:37.817
IN PARIS THIS YEAR.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.819
- DAVID ALREADY TAKES ME
TO DINNER,

28:39.852 --> 28:41.087
HE BUYS THE GROCERIES.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.955
HE PAYS
ALL THE HOUSE EXPENSES.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.957
- WHERE DO I SIGN UP?

28:44.991 --> 28:46.158
- IT'S NOT RIGHT.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.527
- BUT IF HE WANTS TO DO IT?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.863
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.
HE SAYS IT MAKES HIM HAPPY.

28:50.897 --> 28:54.266
- THEN STOP BEING
SO GODDAMN SELFISH.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.102
- SELFISH?

28:56.135 --> 28:58.504
- I THINK IT'S SELFISH
TO DENY YOUR LOVER PLEASURE.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.473
- LISTEN TO ME, MICHAEL.
MONEY IS MY BUSINESS.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.376
I'VE SEEN IT DESTROY
MORE RELATIONSHIPS THAN SEX.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.013
OKAY? NOW YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING FAIR TO DAVID

29:07.046 --> 29:08.948
WITH THIS FALSE PRIDE THING
OF YOURS,

29:08.981 --> 29:11.217
BUT IT'LL ONLY CAUSE RESENTMENT
AND FRUSTRATION.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.353
AND FRANKLY, YOU'RE DENYING
YOURSELF THE OPPORTUNITY

29:14.386 --> 29:16.555
TO GO PLACES
THAT YOU COULD NEVER GO

29:16.588 --> 29:19.992
AND DO THINGS
YOU COULD NEVER DO.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.528
- IT'S LIKE WHAT BARBRA SAID
SO ELOQUENTLY

29:22.561 --> 29:24.263
IN HELLO, DOLLY!,

29:24.296 --> 29:26.232
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS YEARS
TOO YOUNG FOR THE PART.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.867
- [scoffs]

29:27.900 --> 29:30.269
- [imitating Barbra Streisand]
"MONEY IS LIKE MANURE.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.004
"IT ISN'T WORTH A THING
UNLESS YOU SPREAD IT AROUND,

29:32.038 --> 29:33.539
"ENCOURAGING THINGS TO GROW.

29:33.572 --> 29:37.276
"YA KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

29:37.309 --> 29:41.280
KISS ME, HORACE."
- [laughing]

29:41.313 --> 29:45.551
[school bell ringing]

29:45.584 --> 29:47.887
- THERE'S A MEETING
AFTER SCHOOL

29:47.920 --> 29:50.189
OF THE GAY-STRAIGHT
STUDENT ALLIANCE.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.291
UH-UH, AFTER SCHOOL
THERE'S A MEETING...

29:52.324 --> 29:54.593
THE GAY-STRAIGHT
STUDENT ALLIANCE.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.829
HEY, YOU WANT A FREE CONDOM?
- OH, YEAH.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.330
- HERE, YOU GOTTA TAKE
ONE OF THESE THEN.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.465
- COOL.
- THANKS.

29:59.498 --> 30:00.599
- HERE.
- CATCH YOU LATER.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.168
- SURE. HERE YOU GO.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.970
- UM, THERE'S A MEETING
AFTER SCHOOL,

30:04.003 --> 30:05.905
PLEASE TAKE A FREE CONDOM
AND A FLYER.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.539
BRIAN KNOWS
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.942
- YEAH, HE'S BRILLIANT.
- AND HOT!

30:09.976 --> 30:11.610
- [sarcastic]
CAN I HAVE A CONDOM?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.312
- SURE.
- UM--

30:13.345 --> 30:15.181
- HEY, TAYLOR,

30:15.214 --> 30:16.582
YOU STARTING A FAGGOT CLUB?

30:16.615 --> 30:19.151
- IT'S FOR GAY STUDENTS
AND STRAIGHT STUDENTS.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.587
- TO PROMOTE TOLERANCE
AND UNDERSTANDING.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.523
- SO NOW BUTT-FUCKING
IS AN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY?

30:24.556 --> 30:28.928
- NO, JUST HANDJOBS.

30:28.961 --> 30:32.464
[labored breathing]

30:32.498 --> 30:35.902
[moans of arousal]

30:39.005 --> 30:40.506
- YOU BETTER NEVER MENTION
THAT AGAIN,

30:40.539 --> 30:42.975
YOU LITTLE COCKSUCKER.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.479
[indistinct chatter]

30:50.382 --> 30:52.885
- I ADMIT
IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.187
- CRAZY? YOU KNOW,
IF THIS IS ABOUT MONEY,

30:55.221 --> 30:56.588
I TOLD YOU
I'D HELP YOU OUT.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.190
- AND YOU HAVE.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.192
BUT I GOT TO START TAKING CARE
OF MYSELF.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.428
I MEAN, I CAN'T KEEP RELYING
ON YOU AND MELANIE.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.663
- OKAY, BUT DO YOU HAVE
TO FUCKING MARRY HIM?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.333
- BUT IT'S NOT A REAL MARRIAGE.
IT'S JUST AN ARRANGEMENT.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.268
- WELL, HE SHOULD ARRANGE
SOMETHING ELSE.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.137
- IF HE WAS STRAIGHT,
HE COULD MEET SOMEONE,

31:11.170 --> 31:12.638
FALL IN LOVE
AND GET MARRIED.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.473
BUT BECAUSE HE'S GAY,
THERE'S NO WAY.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.076
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.446
- WELL, LISTEN
TO THE RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.514
KINDA SOUNDS LIKE THE LINDSAY
I USED TO KNOW.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.650
- [chuckling] OH, YEAH.
WHICH LINDSAY WAS THAT?

31:24.683 --> 31:26.385
- THE LAST YEAR OF COLLEGE
WHEN YOU TURNED

31:26.418 --> 31:28.254
INTO THAT SCARY
POLITICAL DYKE.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.222
- OH, HER.
THE ONE WHO STARTED THE PETITION

31:30.256 --> 31:33.292
TO MAKE DATE RAPE PUNISHABLE
BY CASTRATION.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.361
I EVEN GOT YOU TO SIGN.

31:35.394 --> 31:40.132
- YEAH, WELL, YOU ALWAYS
WERE ONE FOR A WORTHY CAUSE.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.134
LISTEN,
MEL AND I'VE BEEN THINKING.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.570
- WAIT A MINUTE.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.372
DID I JUST HEAR YOU SAY...

31:46.405 --> 31:49.508
"MEL AND I"?

31:49.541 --> 31:52.044
DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY THAT?

31:52.078 --> 31:53.545
YEARS I HAVE STRUGGLED

31:53.579 --> 31:55.547
TO GET MEL AND YOU
TO BE CIVIL TO EACH OTHER,

31:55.581 --> 31:57.583
EVEN BE IN THE SAME ROOM
TOGETHER.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.186
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MEL AND YOU ARE ALLIES?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.054
- [clears throat]

32:02.088 --> 32:04.023
[scoffs]

32:04.056 --> 32:06.325
- CHRIST.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.295
WELL, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO WORRY
ABOUT WHAT MY SELFISH,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.397
SELF-CENTERED,
NARCISSISTIC FRIENDS THINK.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.731
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT MY SON,

32:12.764 --> 32:14.733
AND HOW I'M GOING TO RAISE
AND SUPPORT HIM.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.702
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.971
SO I THINK
YOU SHOULD JUST FUCK OFF.

32:19.005 --> 32:22.308
I'M SURE THAT'S A THOUGHT
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.649
- I THOUGHT A LOT MORE PEOPLE
WOULD COME, DIDN'T YOU?

32:30.682 --> 32:33.419
I MEAN, CONSIDERING
ALL THE CONDOMS WE HANDED OUT.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.288
- YEAH. I GUESS THEY
COULDN'T WAIT TO USE THEM.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.060
- HEY!

32:41.093 --> 32:42.394
NOT A BAD TURNOUT, HUH?

32:42.428 --> 32:45.597
- DEB, WH-WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

32:45.631 --> 32:48.734
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
SOME COOKIES AND MORAL SUPPORT.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.337
HERE YOU GO, KIDS.
HUH?

32:51.370 --> 32:52.471
ENJOY YOURSELVES.

32:52.504 --> 32:56.042
HOME-BAKED.
[chuckles]

32:56.075 --> 32:57.776
MY GREAT-AUNT FAY,
WHO WAS IN BURLESQUE,

32:57.809 --> 33:00.446
SAID YOU SHOULD NEVER GO ON
IN FRONT OF A HUNGRY AUDIENCE.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.314
[giggling]

33:02.348 --> 33:04.316
- WELL, I GUESS WE SHOULD
GET STARTED, HUH?

33:04.350 --> 33:06.418
- WELL...

33:06.452 --> 33:08.420
GOOD LUCK, SUNSHINE. HMM?

33:08.454 --> 33:09.455
YOU TOO, DAPHNE.
KNOCK 'EM DEAD.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.223
[chuckles]

33:11.257 --> 33:12.724
- [clears throat]

33:12.758 --> 33:16.095
COULD WE HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

33:16.128 --> 33:20.766
[mixed chatter]

33:20.799 --> 33:22.801
- [shrill whistle]

33:22.834 --> 33:26.338
[students silence]
THANK YOU.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.475
- HI.
UM, I'M DAPHNE.

33:29.508 --> 33:33.112
WELCOME TO THE FIRST MEETING
OF THE ST. JAMES

33:33.145 --> 33:35.514
GAY-STRAIGHT
STUDENT ALLIANCE.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.717
IN THE UPCOMING WEEKS,
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING ISSUES

33:38.750 --> 33:41.320
THAT AFFECT ALL OF US HERE
AT ST. JAMES...

33:41.353 --> 33:42.654
- ISN'T THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE ABOUT SEX?

33:42.688 --> 33:44.623
[murmuring agreement]
- SEX IS PART OF IT.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.792
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT
OTHER THINGS.

33:46.825 --> 33:49.528
LIKE HOW WE SEE OURSELVES
AND EACH OTHER.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.532
- FUCK THIS. LET'S GO.

33:57.503 --> 33:58.804
- FAGGOT!

33:58.837 --> 34:01.740
COCKSUCKER! HOMO!

34:01.773 --> 34:04.710
FUDGE-PACKER!

34:04.743 --> 34:07.746
THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE NAMES
THAT I HAVE BEEN CALLED

34:07.779 --> 34:10.082
BECAUSE I'M GAY.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.151
I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD
THAT I'M GOING TO HELL,

34:12.184 --> 34:15.387
AND THAT I SHOULD DIE
OF AIDS.

34:15.421 --> 34:19.391
MAYBE THE SAME THING
HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.

34:19.425 --> 34:22.694
THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE...

34:22.728 --> 34:25.297
TO SEE IF WE CAN LEARN
TO ACCEPT OUR DIFFERENCES

34:25.331 --> 34:28.567
AND RECOGNIZE
OUR SIMILARITIES.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.103
BECAUSE GAY OR STRAIGHT,
WE ALL WANT THE SAME THINGS.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.306
- ALL RIGHT, TAYLOR,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.175
- WE'RE--WE'RE JUST HAVING
A MEETING.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.676
- DID YOU GET PERMISSION
FROM THE PRINCIPAL?

34:37.709 --> 34:39.245
DID YOU ASK TO USE
THIS CLASSROOM?

34:39.278 --> 34:42.848
DO YOU HAVE AN ADVISOR?
- HE'S GOT ME.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.116
- AND WHO ARE YOU?

34:44.150 --> 34:45.484
- DEBBIE NOVOTNY.
WHO ARE YOU?

34:45.517 --> 34:47.319
- I'M A MEMBER OF THE FACULTY.

34:47.353 --> 34:48.454
- WELL, THEN,
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

34:48.487 --> 34:51.257
THAT WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM HERE.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.724
SO WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN?

34:52.758 --> 34:55.294
YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.463
- IS THIS A PART
OF YOUR CURRICULUM?

34:57.496 --> 35:00.566
- YOU BET YOUR ASS IT IS.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.269
- NOW, ALL OF YOU, ON YOUR WAY.
THIS MEETING IS OVER.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.305
COME ON! LET'S GO!

35:06.338 --> 35:08.140
[inaudible whispers]

35:08.174 --> 35:12.644

35:12.678 --> 35:14.480
- YEAH, NICE TRY, MAN.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.615
- SEE YOU, MAN.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.184
- TRY AGAIN, DAPHNE.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.465
- [long sigh]

35:33.499 --> 35:35.767
- FUCK.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.770
[accordion music]

35:38.804 --> 35:39.805
*

35:39.838 --> 35:42.674
- MAN,
IT'S BEEN A LONG WEEK.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.444
[record scratching]

35:45.477 --> 35:48.814
I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO TAKING SOME TIME OFF.

35:51.550 --> 35:57.189
GOT A PATIENT AT 7:30.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.857
GOOD NIGHT.

36:05.431 --> 36:11.237
- DAVID?
- YES?

36:11.270 --> 36:14.406
- DO YOU THINK I'M SELFISH?

36:14.440 --> 36:18.344
- [sigh] YOU?

36:18.377 --> 36:19.978
WHAT KIND OF A QUESTION
IS THAT?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.913
- I MEAN, ABOUT...

36:21.947 --> 36:24.450
N-NOT TAKING YOU UP
ON YOUR GENEROSITY, LIKE--

36:24.483 --> 36:27.653
LIKE GOING ON THIS TRIP.

36:27.686 --> 36:32.558
- MICHAEL...

36:32.591 --> 36:34.526
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,

36:34.560 --> 36:37.229
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS MAKE YOU HAPPY.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.898
- YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT WOULD--

36:39.931 --> 36:44.002
[whispering]
WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY?

36:44.035 --> 36:47.473
- WHAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY?

36:50.909 --> 36:56.482
SEEING YOU SEE PARIS
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

36:56.515 --> 37:00.352
SAILING DOWN THE SEINE
ON A BATEAU-MOUCHE,

37:00.386 --> 37:02.854
HAVING THE BEST MEAL
OF OUR LIVES AT...

37:02.888 --> 37:06.325
LE GRAND VEFOUR
OR, UH...

37:06.358 --> 37:09.661
ALAIN DUCASSE.

37:09.695 --> 37:10.796
SEEING YOUR EYES LIGHT UP

37:10.829 --> 37:13.265
WHEN YOU FIND SOME NEAT
LITTLE TOY IN A FLEA MARKET--

37:13.299 --> 37:17.269
THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

37:17.303 --> 37:19.905
THAT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY.

37:19.938 --> 37:25.611
- I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.480
- ARE YOU SAYING
YOU WANT TO GO?

37:28.514 --> 37:30.649
- WELL, SINCE YOU ALREADY
WENT AHEAD

37:30.682 --> 37:36.021
AND MADE THE PLANS
AND EVERYTHING--

37:36.054 --> 37:38.624
- DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS.

37:38.657 --> 37:42.728
- NO, JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL LET ME PAY FOR SOMETHING

37:42.761 --> 37:45.697
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.967
- I'LL LET YOU PAY
FOR THE BAGUETTES.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.908
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PRACTICE OUR FRENCH?

37:56.942 --> 37:58.644
[electronica music]

38:13.959 --> 38:15.761
* TO NUMBER ONE

38:15.794 --> 38:22.334
*

38:22.368 --> 38:24.736
* NUMBER ONE

38:24.770 --> 38:30.476
*

38:30.509 --> 38:32.478
- THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

38:32.511 --> 38:37.949
- OH, I LIKE THIS ONE TOO.
- [chuckles]

38:37.983 --> 38:39.618
WE DO MAKE A HANDSOME FAMILY.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.354
HUH?
- MM-HMM.

38:42.388 --> 38:45.557
- WE SHOULD PUT THIS ONE
IN A FRAME...

38:45.591 --> 38:48.794
INSTEAD OF THAT ONE.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.563
BRIAN.
HE'S VERY BEAUTIFUL.

38:51.597 --> 38:54.366
- LOTS OF GUYS
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.968
- ESPECIALLY HIS LIPS.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.904
THEY'RE QUITE KISSABLE, YES?

38:58.937 --> 39:00.105
- NO!

39:00.138 --> 39:01.540
- OH! LA LA!
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.

39:01.573 --> 39:03.775
I CAN TELL
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.378
AND NEITHER DOES MELANIE
OR YOUR OTHER FRIENDS...

39:06.412 --> 39:07.713
- IT'S NOT YOU
THEY DON'T LIKE.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.648
IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.850
BUT IT'S NOT THEIR DECISION.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.420
HMM.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.588
- WELL, YOU ARE
A WONDERFUL PERSON, LINDSAY.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.490
- [scoffing]
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S TRUE.

39:18.524 --> 39:21.460
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU,
I'D HAVE TO LEAVE THE STATES.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.429
NOW I'LL BE ABLE TO STAY.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.531
[doorbell ringing]

39:33.939 --> 39:34.973
[door closing]

39:35.006 --> 39:37.142
CHERIE, C'EST MELANIE.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.116
GUS SHOULD BE UP
FROM HIS NAP.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.553
I'LL GO CHECK.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.695
- I GUESS IF GUS LIKES HIM,
HE MUST BE OKAY.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.163
GUS KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN WHO'S AN ASSHOLE

39:58.196 --> 39:59.765
AND WHO'S NOT, RIGHT?

39:59.798 --> 40:04.002
- RIGHT.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.170
- WHAT ARE THESE?

40:05.203 --> 40:06.905
- JUST SOME PHOTOGRAPHS.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.707
IT'S IMPORTANT
TO CREATE A HISTORY,

40:08.740 --> 40:12.678
IN CASE IMMIGRATION EVER DECIDES
TO PAY A VISIT.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.013
- OH, JESUS.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.915
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH WITH THIS--

40:16.948 --> 40:18.650
THIS...
- WHAT?

40:18.684 --> 40:21.086
- CHARADE.
AND FOR WHO?

40:21.119 --> 40:22.721
SOMEBODY YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.856
- I TOLD YOU, HE'S A FRIEND.
- I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.058
IT'S THE MOST MESHUGGANAH IDEA
I EVER HEARD OF.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.660
I GUARANTEE YOU THAT
IF I HAD BEEN HERE--

40:28.694 --> 40:31.863
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.836
- I WISH I WAS.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.978
I MISS YOU, LINDS.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.881
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE OF GUILLAUME.

40:49.915 --> 40:55.053
- [giggling]

40:55.086 --> 40:58.957
NO, I'M NOT.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.727
I MISS YOU EVERY MINUTE...

41:01.760 --> 41:05.263
OF EVERY DAY.

41:05.296 --> 41:10.869
AND IF I COULD MISS YOU
MORE THAN THAT, I WOULD.

41:10.902 --> 41:15.574
- YOU THINK
I DON'T MISS YOU?

41:15.607 --> 41:17.275
- THEN WHY AREN'T I HERE?
I MEAN--

41:17.308 --> 41:19.244
WHY AREN'T WE RAISING
OUR SON TOGETHER?

41:19.277 --> 41:20.712
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

41:20.746 --> 41:22.013
- WELL, IT DID AT THE TIME.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.282
I MEAN,
ALL THE THINGS YOU SAID,

41:24.315 --> 41:25.684
THAT I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
ENOUGH AFFECTION...

41:25.717 --> 41:26.918
- OH.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.120
- THAT I WAS ONLY CONCERNED
ABOUT GETTING MY OWN NEEDS MET.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.122
- I WAS WRONG.
IT WAS ME.

41:31.156 --> 41:35.126
I BECAME JEALOUS
AND RESENTFUL AND...

41:35.160 --> 41:37.195
I DEMANDED WAY TOO MUCH.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.931
- YOU WERE HURT.

41:39.965 --> 41:43.201
- SO WERE YOU.

41:43.234 --> 41:45.704
- YEAH.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.939
WELL...

41:47.973 --> 41:49.608
I GUESS WE'RE ONLY...
- HUMAN?

41:49.641 --> 41:52.878
[both chuckling]

41:52.911 --> 41:53.945
- YEAH.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.246
- PARDON?

41:55.280 --> 41:57.048
UH, DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE GUS HIS LUNCH,

41:57.082 --> 41:59.751
OR SHOULD I?

41:59.785 --> 42:01.753
- I'LL DO IT.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.336
- OKAY, EVERYBODY WAVE.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.238
COME ON.
PUT SOMETHING INTO IT.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.608
OH, YOU CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

42:22.641 --> 42:24.876
- WHO DO YOU THINK WE ARE,
MATT DAMON AND BEN AFFLECK?

42:24.910 --> 42:26.277
- [scoffs]
I WISH.

42:26.311 --> 42:28.013
- NOW YOU GUYS CAN SEE US
RUNNING ALL OVER

42:28.046 --> 42:29.648
THE STREETS OF PARIS,

42:29.681 --> 42:30.916
AND IT'LL BE JUST
LIKE YOU'RE THERE WITH US.

42:30.949 --> 42:34.686
- OH, I CAN HARDLY WAIT.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.188
- THAT CAMERA IS
THE MOST EXPENSIVE MODEL.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.657
MY DAD HAS ONE LIKE IT.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.258
LET ME HAVE IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.060
YEAH, IT NOT ONLY SHOOTS
THE MOVIE,

42:42.093 --> 42:43.629
IT MAKES POPCORN
TO GO WITH IT.

42:43.662 --> 42:44.830
- [laughing]

42:44.863 --> 42:46.798
- I GUESS YOU DIDN'T GET IT
AT THE BIG Q.

42:46.832 --> 42:49.300
- DAVID LIKES TO GO
FOR THE HIGH-END.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.336
- THAT MUST KEEP YOU
ON YOUR TOES.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.138
- HEY, IS THAT JACKET NEW?

42:53.171 --> 42:56.074
- SNAZZY, MICHAEL.

42:56.107 --> 42:58.009
- BOSS. NOT BAD.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.045
- WELL, I HAD TO HAVE
SOMETHING TO WEAR.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.680
- CHECK OUT THIS LUGGAGE.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.949
- [gasps] IT'S EVEN GOT
