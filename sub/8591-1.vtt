 about by your will to win.

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.252
 - Here we go.
 - Let's get 'em!

01:03:15.526 --> 01:03:17.993
 What the heck is that thing?

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:19.528
 Who cares? Just shoot it.

01:03:24.868 --> 01:03:27.068
      We did win, didn't we?

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:29.905
 No,
 but if we think fast enough

01:03:29.907 --> 01:03:31.339
 we just might
 live to lie about it.

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.146
       What's the problem?
       Just vaporize

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.182
          everyone, everything.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:42.918
 Poof!  Mission accomplished.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.087
     Medals, awards, a parade.
     Next?

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:49.858
 No, wrong,
 false, none of the above.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.527
     - Why? Because we're not
     supposed to be here.
     - What?

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.363
 We goofed. We erred.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.499
       We misinterpreted
       the data at hand.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.935
          I told you so.

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:03.905
 Let me explain the
 situation in a nutshell.

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:07.175
      There are 5 of us
      and 4 billon of them.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:11.279
 They have
 strategic air commands,
 nuclear-powered submarines

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.315
          and John Wayne.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.483
          We have this.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:17.452
        - Is it loaded?
        - Let's find out.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:22.324
    Wait!
    We've got bigger problems.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:25.060
      - What's worse than this?
      - That.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.261
       Who let him out?

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:31.433
  Martians
  I'm afraid we have no choice.

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:35.103
 We will have to use the D.O.D.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:38.940
            Break out the kits.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.509
         What's the D.O.D?

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.212
               What does it do?

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:52.153
        You can't!
        If you let your friends
        blow up the Earth

01:04:52.155 --> 01:04:54.122
 I'll never speak to you again.

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:58.059
        Hold your fire.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.628
 Hold your fire!

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:03.231
          Put your guns down.

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:13.108
 What the heck is that?

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:30.425
        Citizens of Earth,
        surrender or die.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:34.195
 Why should we?
 We've got you surrounded.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:36.398
 Take it easy, Klembecker.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.035
        If you don't surrender,
        or attempt to kill us

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:43.405
     this device will detonate,
     and you, your town

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:46.207
      and everything within
      a million mile radius

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:48.143
 will just simply go

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.644
              kaboom!

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.346
             Wow!

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.450
 You'll be killed, too!

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:58.219
 Wrong! This, you see,

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:00.722
 is the donut of destruction!

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:07.195
 It will obliterate all of you

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:10.498
 while leaving us
 completely unscathed.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.202
 Yeah? What about your ship?

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.972
 Won't it be obliterated, too?

01:06:22.379 --> 01:06:25.680
 - We're doomed!
 - Let's let 'em have it!

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:29.084
 Gimme that.
 Prepare to die, Earth scum.

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:49.437
              You did it again.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:52.207
              You put tab '"A"
              into slot "B".

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:55.143
       - I must've told
       you a hundred times!
       - No, I didn't!

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:58.079
 - It wasn't me.
 - You want to argue or live?

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:00.181
           Get 'em!

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.650
 Are you all right?

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:06.254
     - I can't move.
     My whole body's asleep.
     - I'll get help.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.458
 Hey, somebody help. Hurry!

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:14.229
                      Kathy?

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.767
 Kathy! I've been
 looking all over for you.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.802
 What the heck is that?

01:07:22.773 --> 01:07:25.340
 You're alive!

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:28.209
 "Prepare to die, Earth scum."

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:30.779
      I'll make sure they carve
      that on your tombstone.

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:33.348
 Aw, shut up.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:37.786
 They was all I needed to save
 my farm and I almost had 'em.

01:07:37.788 --> 01:07:42.090
        I could have been rich
        and never had to worry.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:44.726
 It's gonna be all right.
 I'll take you to my place.

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:48.096
 They landed on my farm.
 That counts for something.

01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:50.698
 - Sure it does.
 - Verndroid to Capt. Bipto.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.335
 Capt. Bipto, come in, please.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:57.105
 [ Russell ] There's something
 wrong with my brother.

01:07:57.107 --> 01:08:00.475
     - Vern's your brother?
     - Capt. Bipto,
     come in, please!

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:03.645
 - He used to be.
 - Vern, are you all right?

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:05.747
        It must be shock.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.216
 I'll take him to my place.

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:11.853
 I'll take care of your truck.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:14.856
 Keep an eye on
 that until I get back.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:18.259
 Listen,
 Russell is the sheriff now.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.161
 Listen to what he says.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.569
 [ Russell ] All right,
 let's get organized.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:29.636
        Are you all right?

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:32.607
      Yes.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:36.845
    You have a good explanation
    as to what you were doing

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:39.481
 riding in an alien spacecraft?

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:47.889
              Nice knowing you.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:58.133
     What have we here?

01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.834
          Martians got popcorn?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.417
                 Here you go.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.157
            It'll be all right.

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.796
 [Kathy] What are we gonna do?

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.932
 You're going to bed.

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:33.301
  - What are you gonna do?
  - I don't know.

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:35.636
 I'll call
 the air force, I guess.

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:38.573
 You can't. They hate Martians.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:42.644
            They'll shoot and
            drop nuclear bombs.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:45.580
 I don't know about bombs
 but they deserve whatever
 they get. Now come on.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.814
        But, Dad, they're
        not really bad.

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:50.285
       They're just stupid.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.587
           They haven't
           really hurt anybody.

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:55.757
       If we help them get away

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:59.227
       no one will ever
       know the difference.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:01.896
      Honey, I'm supposed
      to be the sheriff.

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.399
    If I don't get
    help to control this

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:06.701
 and it gets more out of hand

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:08.903
      it'll be my fault.

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:11.973
 I might as well
 throw away this badge.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:15.376
      That's all you care
      about, your stupid badge.

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.879
     If you want to be a
     big, important sheriff,

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:19.380
      why don't you do
      things yourself?

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:23.218
       At least they have
       a chance with you.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:48.409
 What are we going to do now?

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.879
      Looks like we'll have
      to apply for citizenship.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:55.617
       If only we
       could have connected
       with the invasion force.

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:58.553
 It could have been glorious!

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.989
 If we ever get out, remind me.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:03.925
     I've got a real
     funny story to tell you.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:06.661
                We're doomed to
                spend our lives

01:11:06.663 --> 01:11:09.664
        breathing 74% nitrogen.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:16.971
         <i> ¶ Oh, give me a home</i>

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:20.608
         <i> ¶ Where</i>
         <i> the asteroids roam</i>

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.546
       <i> ¶ And the dweebs and</i>
       <i> the fuzzymugs play</i>

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:29.317
     <i> ¶ Where gravity's low</i>

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:32.920
    <i> ¶ and the water is slow</i>

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:38.459
       <i> ¶ And the desert</i>
       <i> winds blow you away</i>

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:43.865
     <i> ¶ Mars, Mars is my home</i>

01:11:43.867 --> 01:11:48.903
        <i> ¶ Where everyone's</i>
        <i> short just like me</i>

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:51.706
       <i> ¶ I wish I was where</i>

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:54.909
          <i> ¶ There is not</i>
          <i> so much air</i>

01:11:54.911 --> 01:12:00.348
        <i> ¶ And two moons to</i>
        <i> smile down upon me ¶</i>

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:13.528
 Hey, what are you doing here?

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.396
    There's no place like home.

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:19.334
    There's no place like home.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:23.404
    There's no place like home.

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:40.888
 Hey, shortstuff, welcome back.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.558
 We're trying to figure
 out how to get outta here.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.660
          Got any bright ideas?

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:53.434
   Well,
   bless your little batteries.

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:59.006
 Number for the Strategic
 Air Command, please.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:01.709
 <i> What extension, please?</i>

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:07.115
 Do you have a listing for
 reporting unusual phenomena?

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.384
        <i> - A U.F.O.?</i>
        - That'll do.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:11.652
         <i> There's no</i>
         <i> such listing.</i>

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:15.990
  <i> I do have unlimited</i>
  <i> listings for psychiatrists.</i>

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:18.426
 Wait, lady,
 I don't need to hear this.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.999
             Oh, no.

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.770
 Kathy?

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:31.706
 Kathy?

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.875
 Kathy?

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.144
 [ Kathy ] You melonheads!

01:13:36.146 --> 01:13:38.746
 That was just
 an old radio show.

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:43.418
 I figured out why you're here.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.421
 You were sent to ruin my
 Halloween, weren't you?

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:49.157
    Capt. Bipto to Verndroid.
    Come in, please.

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:51.592
 Capt. Bipto to Verndroid!

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.195
       Yes, Capt. Bipto?

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:57.665
     Remember the surprise
     we were working on?

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.967
       The time has come

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:03.771
    to unleash its terror!

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.941
 Would you like it
 equipped with nuclear warheads
 or particle beam weapons?

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:09.043
         Who me?

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:12.046
         <i> Whatever. Be creative.</i>
         <i> We'll meet you there.</i>

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:20.822
        - Well?
        - Let's do it.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.060
          [ Beeping ]

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:29.564
        - Aw!
        - What's wrong?

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:32.033
 The hyperfusion-feedback
 governor on the ship

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:34.235
 just had a meltdown.

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:36.170
 If we don't get
 back to zero gravity

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:39.774
 in the next, oh, hour,

01:14:39.776 --> 01:14:41.976
 the ship's
 hyperdrive will implode

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:44.178
 creating
 an ever-expanding hole

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.782
 in the space-time continuum.

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:51.586
 Making you, me, and the
 rest of this galaxy

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:54.922
 some other universe's problem.
 Right?

01:14:54.924 --> 01:14:56.123
 Close enough.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:20.648
 [ Giggywig ]
 We look stupid, don't we?

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:23.184
 Keep your head down.
 Maybe no one will see us.

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.086
 I don't see why
 I have to pedal.

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:27.255
 Nobody rides for free.

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:28.956
        What's he doing?

01:15:32.929 --> 01:15:35.763
             It's my dad!

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:39.000
        - Did he spot us?
        - I don't think so.

01:15:42.305 --> 01:15:46.574
 [ Klembecker ] Outta the way.
 Shotgun coming through.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:48.576
 We need more ammo.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:54.615
     - Did you get them?
     - We almost got 'em.

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:57.852
 - Mr. Klembecker shot a bunny.
 - Shut up!

01:15:57.854 --> 01:16:00.288
      - It was charging!
      - Let's stay cool.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:02.757
 I don't want
 anybody to get hurt.

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:06.327
          We're trapped.
          What are we gonna do?

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:09.764
 Die horrible, searing
 deaths in less than an hour.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.668
   Can we help?

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.937
 [ Vern ] No, I'm fine.

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:19.840
 A little more ocular
 welding and we'll be set.

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:21.842
 What the heck is that?

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:25.680
    It's a diversion. We're
    gonna get the ship back.

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:28.115
 You better not try to stop us!

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:31.852
 If you get through me,
 you'll have to deal with him.

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:35.089
 Relax,
 kid, I've just come to help.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:41.095
 I already got
 a whole bunch of pictures.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:45.766
 If I help them get away,
 I'll have the only ones.

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:48.869
 Gentlemen, I present

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:51.639
      the farmzoid.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.823
 - All right.
 - Hurry, hurry!

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:23.337
 Now that's a diversion!

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:31.145
                We can't wait.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:34.215
          We have to chance it.

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:37.151
 I told you to go to bed!

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:43.391
 Take me to your secret
 government labs, and cut me
 into wafer-thin sections.

01:17:43.393 --> 01:17:47.061
        They want to go home.
        They've made a mistake.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:49.730
 And they're sorry. Aren't you?

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:52.199
 And getting
 sorrier by the minute.

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.769
       The ship's gonna blow up

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:56.203
       and destroy
       the Earth in 15 minutes!

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.273
             Really, Dad.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.409
 Hey, it's your planet.

01:18:01.411 --> 01:18:03.878
 Just for the sake of argument,

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.948
       how are you
       planning on getting out?

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.217
 There's a few things
 I haven't tried yet.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:12.853
 They're risky,
 but better than death.

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:14.055
 Probably.

01:18:19.896 --> 01:18:24.131
   We worked really hard on
   creating this big diversion.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.300
            A diversion?

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:29.003
     What kind of a diversion?

01:18:29.005 --> 01:18:31.739
         What the heck is that?

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.748
            Uh, that diversion.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:53.761
            I gotta admit.
            That's a diversion.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.807
         I don't care what the
         heck that thing is.

01:19:07.877 --> 01:19:09.443
          Adios.

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:12.513
         Hey, Klembecker?

01:19:12.515 --> 01:19:14.482
      Laugh now, butthead!

01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:16.283
 I'll drive.

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.887
 Hey?

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:23.524
      Mayday, Mayday.

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:27.128
          Look, you guys caused
          a lot of damage here.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.830
      You're gonna have to
      make restitution somehow.

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:32.767
        If you promise me that,
        then I'll help you.

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.302
 Promise me that you can hit
 that blinking red light

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:37.538
 in the next 10 seconds

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.374
 or we're gonna need help
 from a higher source.

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:41.842
         Hang on.

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.046
 Aaah!

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:47.848
     - Which red button?
     - That one.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:51.152
 Not that one!

01:19:56.893 --> 01:19:59.360
 Mayday. Somebody answer me.

01:20:00.997 --> 01:20:04.165
 Capt. Bipto, what's wrong?

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.901
        We've got problems.
        We'll need a miracle

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:10.204
 to get this baby off the
 ground, much less outer space.

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:14.241
 Can you tip that
 contraption up on its butt?

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:16.811
    If the vertical orientation
    struts are functioning.

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:18.546
 I think I've got you covered

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:21.182
   but we have to get
   back to the farm.

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:22.483
 - Tell them to meet us there.
 - Right.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.920
 Meet at the Wrenchmuller farm.

01:20:25.922 --> 01:20:28.322
         Bipto out.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.258
 Hey, where do you guys
 grow your Wrenchmullers?

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:35.296
 There must be
 something we can use.

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:38.165
 You can't just take a car.

01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:42.136
           It's all right, kid.

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:43.537
             I know this guy.

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:51.245
          Vern, you come
          down right now, hear?

01:20:54.884 --> 01:20:57.952
 Shoot,
 my helpless friends, shoot!

01:20:57.954 --> 01:21:00.020
 Fire everything you've got.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.522
 The farmzoid is impervious.

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:06.160
 That's it.
 Mom's gonna hear about this!

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:16.503
       - Make a left.
       - Left?

01:21:16.505 --> 01:21:18.339
      - Left?
      - Right. I mean, yes.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:21.342
        Come back, you cowards.
        Come back here!

01:21:21.344 --> 01:21:24.278
       It's just
       a big toy robot.

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:29.316
 If I win, the whole tank wins

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:31.418
      not just one guy.

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:35.422
         Aaah!

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.332
          [ Laughs ]

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:51.505
   In case anybody's interested

01:21:51.507 --> 01:21:54.341
       we have 12 minutes until
       the end of the world.

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:56.911
 Put this puppy
 into hyperdrive!

01:21:56.913 --> 01:21:59.113
      Maybe I better
      take a shortcut.

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:07.421
 Listen,
 I'd like to live to see

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.323
 the end of the world!

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:10.591
         Okay?

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:15.062
              There's the farm.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.400
               Whoa!

01:22:25.975 --> 01:22:28.976
              I'm telling you,
              that ship has got

01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:31.111
   the flight
   potential of a cement truck.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:33.147
 I can fix that.

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:36.383
 What's that?

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:40.120
 That's a farmer's
 all-purpose helper.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:44.625
 It's guaranteed to
 remove stumps, gophers,

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:48.062
 and improve
 the flight potential
 of a Martian spaceship.

01:22:48.064 --> 01:22:50.965
         - Get outta here.
         - Help yourselves.

01:22:50.967 --> 01:22:53.600
 Wait up. This I gotta see.

01:22:53.602 --> 01:22:57.071
<i> This is your captain speaking.</i>

  <i> I hope we live long enough</i>
  <i> to do this again sometime.</i>

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.014
 Come on. You're not
 gonna believe this!

01:23:10.186 --> 01:23:13.087
 - Bypass the ecto-thruster.
 - Guys, wait a minute.

01:23:13.089 --> 01:23:15.189
 That's the guy who
 wants to blow us up.

01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:18.092
 Flight One to Mars
 now boarding.

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:20.060
            What are you
            gonna do with this?

01:23:20.062 --> 01:23:22.196
 Sheriff, ain't you ever put

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:25.699
 a cherry bomb
 under a garbage can?

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:28.068
      - Ha-ha-ha.
      - A what?

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:30.371
    Don't you guys ever listen?

01:23:30.373 --> 01:23:33.107
 - Anybody seen my astroplans?
 - Who took
 the torus calibrator?

01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:35.209
            Listen to me.

01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:37.544
      Blaznee, we'll fix that
      later. Prepare to launch.

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:40.280
      - This isn't gonna work.
      - Don't worry.

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:42.750
 Our Earth friends are gonna
 give us an extra boost.

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:46.286
     That guy wants to
     boost his bank account.

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:48.555
        He's trying to
        blow up the ship.

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:50.624
          Assume vertical
          launch position.

01:23:53.062 --> 01:23:55.629
        Verndroid,
        this is Capt. Bipto.

01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:58.165
          Are you receiving me?

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.701
  - Verndroid, come in, please.
  <i> - Yes, Capt. Bipto.</i>

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.070
 How may I be of assistance?

01:24:03.072 --> 01:24:06.173
 Your assignment is complete,
 Verndroid.

01:24:06.175 --> 01:24:08.475
      Your bravery and devotion
      have saved us all.

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:12.212
     I am so proud of you, son.

      It has been
      a pleasure serving you.

                 Now

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:29.096
 <i> I must bid you adieu.</i>

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:31.398
 There's much work to be done.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.233
 You see,
 I have plans for this world,

01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:35.836
       big plans!

01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:39.239
       Verndroid away!

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:43.777
                   Mm-hmm.

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:47.147
   NASA spends years
   calculating fuel loads,

01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:51.151
 launch pressures, and
 orbital-window dynamics.

01:24:51.153 --> 01:24:53.654
 You're just
 gonna stuff dynamite
 under this and light the fuse?

01:24:54.657 --> 01:24:56.757
             Actually,

01:24:56.759 --> 01:24:59.493
      I was gonna use this.

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:01.161
 Kids, get behind that tractor.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:10.604
 This is supposed to save us
 from the end of the world?

01:25:11.707 --> 01:25:14.808
        Now, before we go

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:18.278
 does anyone need to
 go to the bathroom?

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:22.549
 Is this really gonna
 work? If it's not

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:25.552
 we ought to figure out
 how to defuse that
 nuclear cosmos-whatever it is.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.521
            You know how?

01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:29.823
             No.

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:32.793
      Then move out,
      or this is gonna
      solve everyone's problem,

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:41.602
        one way or another.

01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:44.805
 Hey,
 I'm not going home in a bag!

01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:47.474
 I made it! I'm never
 gonna do this again.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.176
 Same here.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.311
               Oh!

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:03.690
         Red alert.
         Run for your lives!

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:10.697
         Leave them alone.

01:26:10.699 --> 01:26:14.635
      - Kathy, get back.
      - They want to go home.

01:26:14.637 --> 01:26:17.404
        Impossible.
        They have failed
        in their mission.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:21.575
 If you kill them
 now, the gravity hyperfusion

01:26:21.577 --> 01:26:23.644
        pheto-cuisinart
        will blow up in

01:26:23.646 --> 01:26:26.346
 5 minutes or so.

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:28.782
   The Earth will implode and
   throw Mars out of orbit

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:31.552
 and it'll go
 crashing into the sun.

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:35.355
 That would be a blemish on
 the old perfection record.

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:37.824
       And expensive.

01:26:37.826 --> 01:26:40.861
 What if they took it out
 of your paycheck? Whoa!

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:43.530
      What's a planet
      cost these days?

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:45.666
         4 minutes, 30 seconds.

01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:54.408
            Very well.

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.710
 Return to your spacecraft.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.812
         Every Pez for himself!

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:09.656
        Blaznee, you'll have
        exactly 6.38621 seconds

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:12.559
      to fire the main engine
      to reach escape velocity.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.394
       Never tell me
       the decimal points.

01:27:16.532 --> 01:27:21.301
       I'm gonna grow up to
       be 5'7, 5'8 easy.

01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:23.337
           You're full grown.

01:27:23.339 --> 01:27:28.308
      I'm animal.
      You're polypropylene.

01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.378
              Besides

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.480
        they really need you.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:38.018
           We can write

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.788
             or something.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:44.024
      Geez,
      you're breaking my heart.

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:46.627
            Here.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.269
 Come on, shortstuff, before
 they check for green cards.

01:28:00.309 --> 01:28:03.810
 Hey,
 the next time you guys visit

01:28:03.812 --> 01:28:06.480
     pay closer attention
     to our traffic laws.

01:28:06.482 --> 01:28:09.516
 Next time we visit?
 Yeech!

01:28:11.053 --> 01:28:14.888
 Well, thanks for not killing
 them, Mr. Enforcer Drone.

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:18.592
 Sorry to interrupt. 3 minutes!

01:28:18.594 --> 01:28:21.361
       You misunderstood.
       Once we reach

01:28:21.363 --> 01:28:23.330
      the cold, airless
      depths of outer space,

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:26.533
        I shall incinerate them

01:28:26.535 --> 01:28:28.902
       and toss their charred,
       sizzling skeletons
       into the cosmos.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:31.972
 Huh? Say what?

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:34.308
 A quick vacuuming,
 a little air freshener

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:36.677
    and will have completed
    my duties with perfection.

01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:37.911
 What?

01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:40.547
 You can't do that!

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.617
 Better them than us.

01:28:43.619 --> 01:28:45.686
          I beg your pardon?

01:28:45.688 --> 01:28:48.555
        I thought you were
        nice, but I was wrong.

01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:51.325
 You're just a selfish old man.

01:28:51.327 --> 01:28:54.394
 They caused more trouble
 than they was worth.

01:28:54.396 --> 01:28:57.764
 If it hadn't been for you,

01:28:57.766 --> 01:29:00.467
 things might have gotten
 further out of hand.

01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:02.803
 Somebody might even
 have gotten killed.

01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:07.574
 I'd say that makes you a
 hero in both our planets.

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:11.712
 As the ambassador
 of the planet Earth

01:29:11.714 --> 01:29:14.648
 I would like to present
 you with an award

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.950
 as a token of
 our appreciation.

01:29:18.087 --> 01:29:21.621
 The trinitrotoluene award.

01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:26.460
 Kids,
 run and get the champagne

01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:29.029
 so we can do this up proper.

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:32.833
       I accept
       in the name of goodwill,
       with hope

01:29:32.835 --> 01:29:34.968
   for peaceful coexistence
   of our two worlds.

01:29:36.105 --> 01:29:37.971
        It certainly isn't
        much to look at, is it?

01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:43.110
 Let me light it up for you
 so you can get
 the full effect.

01:29:49.585 --> 01:29:51.385
                How pretty!

01:29:54.123 --> 01:29:57.457
 How'd you like to have a photo

01:29:57.459 --> 01:29:59.526
 so you can remember this?

01:29:59.528 --> 01:30:02.162
 Yes, please.

01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:07.768
 Let me back up a bit
 so I can get
 the whole ship into it.

01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:10.804
          Are you sure
          there's enough light?

01:30:10.806 --> 01:30:13.774
        - Oh, there's gonna
        be plenty of light.
        - I'm so proud.

01:30:13.776 --> 01:30:15.509
      I don't know what to say.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.446
 You can just say your prayers.

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:25.786
        - What the...
        - Why aren't we moving?

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:31.958
 Great. We're stuck here.

01:30:33.462 --> 01:30:35.629
 I guess he left.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:39.833
       What happened?

01:30:39.835 --> 01:30:43.503
 It's okay. Mr. Wrenchmuller
 blew up the enforcer drone.

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:45.505
 - Hooray for our side!
 - Time to go.

01:30:46.809 --> 01:30:50.577
 - Take care of yourselves.
 - Break it up.

01:30:50.579 --> 01:30:52.946
             There's billions
             of lives at stake.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.514
                      Move!

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.452
 Don't need to tell me twice.

01:31:23.045 --> 01:31:24.945
 Prepare for takeoff.

01:31:25.914 --> 01:31:29.082
    - Start the countdown.
    - Five

01:31:29.918 --> 01:31:31.651
        - Wait a minute.
        - four

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:36.556
        - three, two...
        - I'm not in my seat.

01:31:36.558 --> 01:31:37.791
               ...one!

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.604
 You blew them up!

01:31:50.606 --> 01:31:53.240
           Yeah, way up!

01:31:55.711 --> 01:31:57.978
         - Go, go, go!
         - Yeah!

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:01.248
          [ Cheering ]

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:13.994
                Whoa!

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:27.574
        That's it. I Quit!

01:32:27.576 --> 01:32:30.644
 Do something!
 You're the pilot.

01:32:30.646 --> 01:32:32.546
     How 'bout if I eject?

01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:33.880
         Lighten the load.

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:38.885
     - Hurry it up, Pez.
     - I'm lightening!

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:41.555
        We're too heavy.
        Something else must go.

01:32:41.557 --> 01:32:45.125
    We've dumped
    everything we can dump.

01:32:45.127 --> 01:32:48.261
        - Except
        - Hit it, Giggy.

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:56.069
          - Yeah!
          - Yea!

01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:09.616
 You know, the last time I put
 a cherry bomb
 under a garbage can

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:14.054
                the garbage can
                didn't make it.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:17.958
            I guess somebody
            up there likes you.

01:33:21.196 --> 01:33:23.296
 They just got lucky.

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.870
 When you see my dog,

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:33.073
 tell him we're
 moving tomorrow.

01:33:48.724 --> 01:33:52.192
 Good morning,
 Mr. Wrenchmuller.

01:33:52.194 --> 01:33:55.161
       The judge send you to
       come and throw me off?

01:33:55.163 --> 01:33:56.963
                    No,

01:33:59.635 --> 01:34:02.135
 but I'm afraid this is legal.

01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:06.139
 It's wrong, but it's legal.

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:09.242
     I was bringing somebody I
     thought you'd want to see.

01:34:09.244 --> 01:34:11.778
 Him? What do I
 want to see him for?

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.713
                  Not him. Him.

01:34:15.884 --> 01:34:17.884
       Aw, Jim, Jim.

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:20.720
 Jim, boy.

01:34:20.722 --> 01:34:23.957
 That's all very touching.

01:34:23.959 --> 01:34:27.260
 As you can see,
 I've got things to do.

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:30.897
 Unless you've got the cash
 or a crop to sign over,

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:33.166
 I suggest you
 hand over those keys.

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:35.301
      Hold it, Jim. Jim!

01:34:35.303 --> 01:34:38.672
 He ain't worth your breath!

01:34:38.674 --> 01:34:42.375
 You want these keys, do you?

01:34:42.377 --> 01:34:43.376
           Ha, ha, ha.

01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:46.279
           Go get 'em!

01:34:54.823 --> 01:34:58.124
            I'm sorry that it
            has to be this way.

01:34:58.126 --> 01:35:00.860
        You wanna hear
        something funny?

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:03.096
                    Sure.

01:35:03.098 --> 01:35:06.299
      You're gonna
      hear it right about

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:08.368
              now.

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:11.171
 Aaah!

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.193
               Aw!

01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:38.098
                  I'll be back!

01:36:00.055 --> 01:36:02.789
      We're only a few
      hours behind schedule.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:05.825
     I was just thinking,
     if we hurry

01:36:05.827 --> 01:36:09.529
 we might make it to Arcturus
 in time to help
 torture prisoners.
