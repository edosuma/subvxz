that was possible.

I'm sorry for calling.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.128
‐ That didn't
answer the question.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.397
‐ Don't do that, Danni.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.566
Do you not call and tell me
everything that Zac is into,

06:39.566 --> 06:40.968
including Fatima?

06:40.968 --> 06:42.269
‐ Oh, so we're
getting even now, hmm?

06:42.269 --> 06:45.539
‐ No, I just, I just, I thought
you may wanna know.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.907
‐ Why?
You never ask about

06:46.907 --> 06:48.242
anything else with him.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.843
‐ Look, that's your man,
or so I thought.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.845
I...I don't know.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.581
‐ We're trying to figure it out.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.849
‐ Okay.

06:55.849 --> 07:00.921
Well, it looks like he's
figuring someone else out.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.557
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:06.226 --> 07:10.330

07:24.678 --> 07:26.313
‐ What about him?

07:26.313 --> 07:30.918
‐ Zac.
Zac did this.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.487
When he first got out,
he worked at a clinic.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.756
She was doing me a favor.

07:35.756 --> 07:41.595
Maybe Him and Preston talked
and he hooked them up.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.996
‐ I see.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.299
‐ Yeah.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.734

31:25.819 --> 31:27.721
‐ I'm just thinking.
‐ What you thinking? Come on.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.089
‐ I'm thinking that this is...

31:29.089 --> 31:32.259
‐ That you want to stop talking
to me, right?

31:32.259 --> 31:35.696
And you wanna shut down.

31:35.696 --> 31:38.832
How am I gonna get to know you
if you do that?

31:38.832 --> 31:40.534
‐ So, I'm just supposed to
be cool with you going

31:40.534 --> 31:43.737
to play ball at 10:00 at night?

31:43.737 --> 31:46.540
‐ No, this is what you gonna do.

31:46.540 --> 31:49.243
You gonna tell me what's
on your mind

31:49.243 --> 31:52.079
and you gonna trust me
the same way

31:52.079 --> 31:56.216
I'm gonna trust you.
It's that simple.

31:57.818 --> 32:00.120
Look at me.

32:00.120 --> 32:03.357
Whenever you get nervous
and you get scared,

32:03.357 --> 32:08.695
you don't look at me.
I know you're scared.

32:09.396 --> 32:11.598
Look at me, look at me.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.967
‐ I'm looking.

32:13.967 --> 32:19.139
‐ I'm not going nowhere
and you're not going nowhere.

32:19.139 --> 32:20.607
You hear me?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.243
‐ I...I don't know.
I don't...mm‐mm.

32:23.243 --> 32:25.279
Do you hear me?

32:25.279 --> 32:27.648
‐ Yes, I hear you.

32:27.648 --> 32:31.785
‐ So, yes, I'm going
to play ball at 10:00 at night.

32:31.785 --> 32:33.053
Okay?

32:33.053 --> 32:35.656
‐ Okay.

32:35.656 --> 32:37.558
So you're gonna play basketball,
right?

32:37.558 --> 32:39.426
‐ Yes, I am.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.128
‐ Okay.
I'll come with you.

32:41.128 --> 32:42.629
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait, wait, wait.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.398
‐ What? We trust, trust,
we talking trust, right?

32:44.398 --> 32:46.333
We trust each other, right?

32:46.333 --> 32:47.634
‐ You just said you
were tired, right?

32:47.634 --> 32:49.403
‐ Yeah, but I just got a
sudden burst of energy...

32:49.403 --> 32:51.471
‐ No, no, no, no, no, stop.
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.

32:51.471 --> 32:53.974
Don't. Fatima, stop.
Don't do that.

32:53.974 --> 32:56.143
‐ What?

32:56.143 --> 32:59.346
‐ Listen.
First of all, I'm not gonna

32:59.346 --> 33:02.916
take you with your fine ass
to go watch me play basketball

33:02.916 --> 33:04.785
at 10 o'clock at night.
I'm not bringing you

33:04.785 --> 33:06.520
around all those dudes.
That's number one.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.055
Number two.
I know you're gonna

33:08.055 --> 33:09.389
do your verifications.

33:09.389 --> 33:10.924
‐ Mm‐hmm, oh,
I'm definitely gonna do that.

33:10.924 --> 33:12.693
‐ I know that.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

33:12.693 --> 33:15.329
‐ But you gonna have
to learn to trust me

33:15.329 --> 33:18.832
the same way I trust you.

33:18.832 --> 33:20.067
Am I clear?

33:20.067 --> 33:22.603
‐ Mhm.

33:22.603 --> 33:24.037
‐ Come on, now.

33:24.037 --> 33:26.273
‐ Well, enjoy your game.

33:26.273 --> 33:28.675
‐ I will. Excuse me.

33:33.347 --> 33:34.781
‐ Not going nowhere.

33:34.781 --> 33:36.116
‐ That's your plan?

33:36.116 --> 33:38.252
‐ Yep. Clink clink.

33:38.252 --> 33:40.053
‐ To keep me locked
in between your legs?

33:40.053 --> 33:41.822
‐ Yes, that's the plan.

33:41.822 --> 33:43.991
‐ I like it here.
‐ Master plan, actually.

33:43.991 --> 33:45.692
‐ It's a master plan?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.294
‐ You know what happens
when I get in here, though?

33:47.294 --> 33:49.396
‐ Yeah, yeah.

33:49.396 --> 33:51.698
‐ Yeah, you was just running
from me about 10 minutes ago.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.333
‐ Yeah, but I got,
I got more energy.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.202
‐ You got more energy?
‐ Yeah, so just stay.

33:55.202 --> 33:58.105
‐ Fatima, that's not gonna work.

33:58.105 --> 34:00.807
We got to do more
than just this.

34:00.807 --> 34:02.976
‐ Okay, you right.

34:02.976 --> 34:05.879
‐ Look at me.

34:05.879 --> 34:09.750
Every time you get scared,
you look away.

34:09.750 --> 34:12.219
‐ You know why I don't wanna
look in your eyes?

34:12.219 --> 34:15.556
‐ No.

34:15.556 --> 34:17.991
‐ Because every time I do,

34:17.991 --> 34:19.860
I fall deeper in love with you.

34:19.860 --> 34:23.397
‐ That's where I want you.
Just want you

34:23.397 --> 34:27.301
to meet me where I am.

34:27.301 --> 34:28.869
Can you do that?

34:28.869 --> 34:30.571
‐ If you keep saying
all the right shit,

34:30.571 --> 34:33.440
I'ma let you go play basketball.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.875
‐ I appreciate that.

34:34.875 --> 34:38.612
‐ Yeah.
And thank you.

34:38.612 --> 34:39.880
‐ For what?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.549
‐ For what you were
gonna do about Hayden.

34:42.549 --> 34:44.851
‐ I told you I got you.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.954
‐ I know.

34:46.954 --> 34:50.257
‐ I'm not gonna let you take
the fall for no shit.

34:50.257 --> 34:52.960
‐ I wouldn't have had to.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.460
‐ No?

34:54.460 --> 34:56.330
‐ No.
My dudes are ride or die.

34:56.330 --> 34:58.765
‐ You think he got the message?

34:58.765 --> 35:02.402
‐ If he don't, he'll be getting
his ass whooped weekly.

35:02.402 --> 35:05.005
Yeah, I don't play that shit.

35:05.005 --> 35:06.473
‐ You ruthless.

35:06.473 --> 35:10.444
‐ Yeah, when it comes
to what's mine, I can be.

35:10.444 --> 35:11.912
‐ Oh, I'm yours.

35:11.912 --> 35:15.716
‐ Bought and paid for.

35:15.716 --> 35:18.519
‐ What makes you think that?

35:18.519 --> 35:21.355
‐ ‐‐‐, wasn't you just calling
my name like a little boy?

35:21.355 --> 35:23.457
Yeah, that's mine.

35:23.457 --> 35:25.292
‐ I was.
‐ I got that.

35:25.292 --> 35:26.927
‐ I'm yours.

35:26.927 --> 35:29.029
‐ I know you are.

35:29.029 --> 35:31.832
‐ Can I go play basketball now?

35:31.832 --> 35:33.834
‐ I guess.

35:36.303 --> 35:39.206
Make sure you dunk it
for me one time.

35:39.206 --> 35:41.241
‐ I got you.
‐ Okay.

35:41.241 --> 35:43.610
‐ All right?
‐ Mhm.

35:43.610 --> 35:46.346
‐ Look, you gonna have
to trust me now.

35:46.346 --> 35:47.714
‐ I trust you.

35:47.714 --> 35:49.116
‐ I'll be back in a few hours.

35:49.116 --> 35:50.884
‐ All right, be careful.

35:50.884 --> 35:52.419
‐ And that's it.

35:52.419 --> 35:54.321
‐ Yes, Zac. That's it.

35:54.321 --> 35:55.722
‐ You sure?

35:55.722 --> 35:57.958
‐ Yeah, we good.
‐ All right.

36:01.828 --> 36:03.530
‐ But Zac?

36:05.666 --> 36:07.868
‐ You don't gotta say it.

36:07.868 --> 36:10.304
I ain't gonna ‐‐ with you.
I've already seen

36:10.304 --> 36:12.573
what you did to Hayden.

36:12.573 --> 36:14.775
‐ Okay.
Have fun.

36:14.775 --> 36:16.543
‐ All right.

36:22.249 --> 36:24.084
You a lot girl.

36:24.084 --> 36:25.552
‐ I know.

36:25.552 --> 36:26.920
That's what you got
two hands for.

36:28.822 --> 36:30.424
‐ Bye.

36:32.459 --> 36:33.894
‐ Where my sneakers?

36:33.894 --> 36:37.030
‐ They smell so I put 'em
outside the door.

36:37.030 --> 36:39.266
You ain't about to be
funking up my house.

36:39.266 --> 36:40.734
‐ And my socks?

36:40.734 --> 36:41.969
‐ Yes.

36:41.969 --> 36:44.071
‐ That's foul!
Foul.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.205
‐ Bye, boy.

36:45.205 --> 36:48.375
‐ Bye.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.844
Ah, here they go!

36:57.317 --> 36:58.752
‐ Oh my gosh, no.

36:58.752 --> 37:00.287
‐ I'm telling you,
it was crazy.

37:00.287 --> 37:03.790
‐ Mm‐mm.
I told you it was a bad idea.

37:03.790 --> 37:05.392
‐ Yeah. Your boy was so mad.

37:05.392 --> 37:06.860
‐ They were so mad.
Can I have one?

37:06.860 --> 37:07.861
‐ Yeah, go ahead.
‐ Thanks.

37:07.861 --> 37:09.630
‐ They were so mad.

37:09.630 --> 37:12.900
‐ I know.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.968
‐ Well, not everybody.
Maurice was the one

37:14.968 --> 37:16.670
that was mad.
You know your boy.

37:16.670 --> 37:18.305
‐ Always hot.
‐ Yeah.

37:18.305 --> 37:19.740
‐ Crazy.

37:19.740 --> 37:21.975
‐ Yeah, but Laz is so cool.
I wish they woulda hit it off.

37:21.975 --> 37:24.978
‐ Me, too.
‐ Yeah.

37:24.978 --> 37:26.813
‐ Well, thank you
for this.

37:26.813 --> 37:28.782
‐ Uh, yeah, this is, um...

37:28.782 --> 37:30.450
‐ Normal?

37:30.450 --> 37:34.755
‐ Yeah, I guess we
haven't had normal in...

37:34.755 --> 37:36.056
‐ Forever.

37:36.056 --> 37:38.625
‐ Yeah.
Cheers to normal.

37:47.467 --> 37:50.370
‐ Sabrina?

37:50.370 --> 37:52.773
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

37:52.773 --> 37:56.243
‐ Um, I'm sorry. I'm Bayo.

37:56.243 --> 37:57.377
‐ Um...

37:57.377 --> 37:59.680
‐ You don't remember me?
‐ No.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.949
‐ You used to work
at the Dallas Street branch.

38:01.949 --> 38:03.717
I would come in all the time.

38:06.753 --> 38:10.090
‐ Yes. Yes.
Hi, how are you?

38:10.090 --> 38:14.061
‐ All the better
after seeing you.

38:14.061 --> 38:15.996
‐ Uh, yeah.

38:15.996 --> 38:18.265
‐ Here, take my number
and give me a call.

38:19.132 --> 38:21.802
‐ This is Calvin.

38:21.802 --> 38:24.505
‐ Hello.
‐ Hi.

38:24.505 --> 38:26.173
‐ So when do you think
we're gonna catch up?

38:26.173 --> 38:27.674
‐ Excuse me, my man?

38:27.674 --> 38:32.179
I don't think you realize
that she's on a date.

38:32.179 --> 38:34.181
‐ Oh, is there
someone else here?

38:37.718 --> 38:41.021
You mean with you?
‐ Yeah.

38:41.021 --> 38:43.390
‐ I am so sorry.

38:43.390 --> 38:46.693
My friend Johnny was telling me
I should come say hi.

38:46.693 --> 38:51.164
I told him you were with someone
but he convinced me that, uh...

38:51.164 --> 38:53.033
‐ Convinced you what?

38:53.033 --> 38:56.069
‐ Well, never mind.

38:56.069 --> 38:58.472
It was so good
to see you, Sabrina.

38:58.472 --> 38:59.740
I'm terribly sorry.

38:59.740 --> 39:02.643
‐ Yeah, be that.

39:07.548 --> 39:11.885
‐ That was, that was weird.
Right?

39:11.885 --> 39:16.423
‐ So he really came over here
and disrespected me like that?

39:16.423 --> 39:18.525
‐ I don't think
he meant it.

39:21.495 --> 39:24.097
‐ You know what?

39:24.097 --> 39:25.966
‐ Calvin, where,
where you going?

39:25.966 --> 39:28.001
‐ Yo, my man?

39:28.001 --> 39:31.171
‐ Hey, I'm sorry man.

39:31.171 --> 39:33.140
‐ That shit you just pulled
at the table?

39:33.140 --> 39:34.508
That shit was rude
and disrespectful

39:34.508 --> 39:36.944
and I think you
owe me an apology.

39:36.944 --> 39:38.979
‐ Look man, I said I'm sorry.

39:38.979 --> 39:41.315
‐ Hey, man, we thought you
were her friend.

39:41.315 --> 39:44.818
‐ I'm not her friend.
I'm her boyfriend.

39:44.818 --> 39:46.086
‐ Okay.
Yeah man, sorry.

39:46.086 --> 39:48.088
‐ Yeah, we get it.

39:48.088 --> 39:51.058
‐ You know what? ‐‐ y'all.

39:51.058 --> 39:53.460

39:53.460 --> 39:55.162
‐ What are you doing?
‐ You better get your friend.

39:55.162 --> 39:56.496
‐ I'm so sorry.

39:56.496 --> 39:57.998
‐ No, don't ‐‐
apologize for me.

39:57.998 --> 39:59.466
‐ Calvin.

39:59.466 --> 40:00.934
‐ No. ‐‐ him.
Bitch ass ‐‐.

40:00.934 --> 40:02.035

40:10.143 --> 40:11.678

It's not that serious.

40:11.678 --> 40:14.181
‐ So him disrespecting me
isn't serious?

40:14.181 --> 40:17.050
‐ Calvin, seriously?
What are you doing?

40:17.050 --> 40:18.986
‐ No, ‐‐ him.
And you don't have to ‐‐

40:18.986 --> 40:21.388
apologize for me for anything.
All right?

40:21.388 --> 40:26.093
‐ Calvin, why are you talking
to me like that?

40:26.093 --> 40:28.161
This is getting out of hand.

40:28.161 --> 40:31.098
‐ Yeah, yeah.
You know what? You're right.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.666
I'm outta here.

40:32.666 --> 40:34.101
‐ Calvin.
‐ Let him go!

40:34.101 --> 40:35.802
