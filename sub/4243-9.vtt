WEBVTT

00:01.171 --> 00:01.931
Give her some room.

00:01.932 --> 00:03.350
She needs space! Breathe, girl, breathe!

00:03.372 --> 00:04.736
Does anyone have anything she can eat?

00:04.737 --> 00:06.777
I have some leftover
Halloween candy in my locker.

00:06.778 --> 00:08.778
I may have a juice box.
I'll go get Marley's mom.

00:08.779 --> 00:09.579
ARTIE:
This is bad.

00:09.580 --> 00:10.535
Never in the history

00:10.553 --> 00:13.872
of show choir competitions
has anyone ever fainted.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.201
We got the juice.
We got the juice.

00:16.202 --> 00:17.642
No, I'm okay.
Drink the damn juice!

00:17.643 --> 00:19.683
FINN: Marley? Marley, are you okay?
What happened?

00:19.684 --> 00:20.884
JAKE:
She hasn't been eating.

00:20.885 --> 00:21.783
She's been skipping lunch.

00:21.784 --> 00:22.384
Is that because

00:22.385 --> 00:23.465
you've been telling her to?

00:23.466 --> 00:24.346
You trying to turn her

00:24.347 --> 00:25.717
into a damn rexy?
What?

00:25.735 --> 00:27.415
No. Why would I...
why would I want that?

00:27.416 --> 00:28.776
'Cause you're a crazy, evil bitch.

00:28.777 --> 00:29.857
Hey, Marley, you all right?

00:29.858 --> 00:32.978
The nurse is on the way, Mr. Schue.
Santana, Puck, you stay here with Marley.

00:32.979 --> 00:34.619
The rest of you guys,
get back up there.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.020
Leaving the stage
mid-competition,

00:36.021 --> 00:38.221
for any reason, is risking
immediate disqualification.

00:38.222 --> 00:39.564
What?! That-that's a rule?

00:39.582 --> 00:40.783
SUE:
Yeah, it's a rule.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.451
One of the bylaws, actually.

00:42.502 --> 00:43.782
As all of you all were spiraling

00:43.783 --> 00:46.738
into a self-created
K-hole of crazy,

00:46.756 --> 00:48.173
the judges, by unanimous vote,

00:48.208 --> 00:51.009
have declared the Warblers victorious.

00:53.279 --> 00:54.639
Hey, congratulations, Finn Hudson.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.000
For the first time in its charmed,

00:56.001 --> 00:57.132
yet pitiful existence,

00:57.183 --> 00:58.917
the New Directions!
Has lost Sectionals.

00:58.935 --> 01:00.469
But here's the good news.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.138
Christmas came early
for one Sue Sylvester.

01:11.834 --> 01:14.415
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

01:14.717 --> 01:16.869
That was Blaine.
They lost.

01:16.903 --> 01:20.372
(gasps) Apparently, the new girl,
Marley, passed out on stage,

01:20.406 --> 01:21.657
and the Warblers won.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.642
Oh, my God. So, wait.
That... that's it then.

01:23.676 --> 01:25.210
What are they going to do now?

01:25.245 --> 01:27.296
I don't know.
I just feel bad for Blaine.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.947
If he was still with the Warblers,

01:28.965 --> 01:31.049
he'd be on his way
to Regionals right now.

01:31.084 --> 01:34.124
You think I should call Finn? If you
think it's gonna make him feel better.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.005
No. I don't, actually.

01:35.006 --> 01:36.788
It'll probably
just make him feel worse.

01:36.806 --> 01:37.844
Imagine coming down

01:37.845 --> 01:40.125
from one loss just to be
reminded of an even bigger one.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.961
Well, our friends' feelings
aside, it's really woken me up

01:42.979 --> 01:45.981
to the idea of making the most
of the chances that you have.

01:46.015 --> 01:48.483
You know? I've got one more
chance of getting into NYADA,

01:48.518 --> 01:49.852
and I can't blow the audition.

01:49.903 --> 01:51.636
It's not your last chance, okay?

01:51.654 --> 01:53.856
I mean, you can still reapply.
No.

01:53.907 --> 01:56.187
I can't live my life chasing
something that the universe

01:56.188 --> 01:58.508
is trying to tell me that I'm
not good enough to achieve.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.746
It's not the universe.
It's just Carmen Tibideaux.

02:00.780 --> 02:01.980
Is there a difference?

02:01.998 --> 02:02.768
Speaking of Carmen,

02:02.769 --> 02:04.649
has she started passing out
her golden tickets

02:04.667 --> 02:06.151
for the Winter Showcase yet?

02:06.169 --> 02:08.586
No, and it doesn't matter,
because I'm not getting one.

02:08.621 --> 02:10.872
Alexandra Blasucci was
the last freshman to get one

02:10.924 --> 02:12.490
in the past seven years,

02:12.508 --> 02:14.760
and she was practically
raised on the Broadway stage.

02:14.794 --> 02:16.714
Wait. How do you even know
about those tickets?

02:16.763 --> 02:18.663
I've become very active
on the NYADA blogs.

02:18.681 --> 02:19.761
I figured, the more I know,

02:19.762 --> 02:22.042
the better I can streamline
my application and audition.

02:22.043 --> 02:23.168
(opera music playing)

02:23.186 --> 02:25.387
<i>The Winter Showcase</i>
<i>is like the NYADA Met Ball.</i>

02:25.438 --> 02:27.838
<i>Ten students are invited to</i>
<i>perform at the showcase a year.</i>

02:27.839 --> 02:29.007
The cream of the cream.

02:29.025 --> 02:32.010
<i>She handwrites and</i>
<i>hand-delivers each invitation.</i>

02:32.028 --> 02:34.062

02:36.733 --> 02:38.951
<i>Golden Globes and even an Oscar.</i>

02:38.985 --> 02:40.235
But they all agree.

02:40.286 --> 02:42.454
The proudest and greatest moment
of their careers

02:42.488 --> 02:44.573
was when Carmen handed them
that Golden Envelope.

03:34.426 --> 03:36.325
on this, my new rehearsal space.

It is now the home of my
brand-new French-Canadian,

03:38.594 --> 03:42.580
circus-inspired Cheerios!
Side project, Sue du Soleil.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.118
Get rid of all this sparkly red stuff.

03:44.169 --> 03:45.929
It still smells like
the Glee Club in here.

03:45.930 --> 03:47.252
What are you talking about?

03:47.270 --> 03:48.753
Well, when your season ended,

03:48.771 --> 03:50.088
with your loss at Sectionals,

03:50.106 --> 03:51.861
I filed the appropriate paperwork

03:51.862 --> 03:54.142
so that the Cheerios! Take
full possession of this room,

03:54.193 --> 03:56.594
including everything
in it... your trophies,

03:56.612 --> 03:59.931
your beloved plaque
with the late Lillian Adler.

03:59.966 --> 04:02.701
And I took her inspirational quotation,

04:02.735 --> 04:05.037
and I re-engraved something
for myself here.

04:05.071 --> 04:07.605
"I died a slow, horrible death
choking on the fluid

04:07.623 --> 04:09.791
in my own lungs."

04:12.328 --> 04:13.996
You...

04:14.030 --> 04:16.882
You can't do this.
Oh, I didn't do this.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.051
You did this, and now
if you'll excuse me,

04:19.084 --> 04:21.553
I'm going to take
your Nationals trophy,

04:21.587 --> 04:24.056
and I'm going to run
over it with my Le Car.

04:25.758 --> 04:28.010
Over my dead body.

04:32.098 --> 04:33.965
(grunting)

04:33.983 --> 04:35.967
Figgins' office.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.986
Now!

04:41.107 --> 04:42.324
Door jam?

04:42.358 --> 04:43.808
(school bell ringing)

04:43.826 --> 04:45.327
How could you have let this happen?

04:45.361 --> 04:46.978
It's not rocket science, Will.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.581
When the football team
loses and the season is over,

04:49.615 --> 04:52.084
they are longer entitled
to use the field!

04:52.118 --> 04:53.651
Fine. We'll use
the auditorium.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.836
The auditorium now belongs

04:54.871 --> 04:56.872
to the McKinley High
Drum and Bugle Corps.

04:56.923 --> 04:58.206
What about the Spanish Room?

04:58.257 --> 04:59.777
I've rented it out to the Rotary Club.

04:59.778 --> 05:01.978
The history classroom? Sex
and Love Addicts Anonymous.

05:01.979 --> 05:03.499
You're telling me that there's nowhere

05:03.500 --> 05:05.420
in this school
that the Glee Club can rehearse?

05:05.454 --> 05:07.454
That's exactly what
I'm telling you, Finn Hudson.

05:07.455 --> 05:08.666
It's pure economics.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.720
The district is running
a seven-figure deficit,

05:11.754 --> 05:13.555
and we're sitting on prime real estate.

05:13.606 --> 05:15.507
SUE:
Let's face facts.

05:15.525 --> 05:17.008
The New Directions!
Are finished.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.843
You have no place
to practice or perform.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.817
The only thing left
to do is to hand over

05:20.818 --> 05:22.898
the keys to the choir room
and inform your students

05:22.949 --> 05:25.200
that Glee Club is over for the year.

05:25.234 --> 05:27.354
And if that's too much
for your feeble constitution,

05:27.370 --> 05:28.887
I'm happy to do it for you.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.290
No.

05:32.325 --> 05:35.710
I'll do it.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.964
(school bell ringing)

05:38.998 --> 05:41.083
(sighs)

05:41.134 --> 05:42.300
How does it feel, Coach?

05:42.335 --> 05:45.036
Got to be honest, Becky.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.722
I have looked forward
to this very moment

05:47.757 --> 05:49.641
for a long time.

05:49.675 --> 05:51.709
Now that it's finally here,

05:51.727 --> 05:55.714
I'm left with a strange, empty feeling.

05:55.748 --> 05:58.650
That's how I felt
when I saw <i>Prometheus.</i>

05:58.684 --> 06:00.552
Now, I'd be lying if I said

06:00.570 --> 06:02.604
I wasn't a little concerned
about them, Becky.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.556
(sighs)

06:04.574 --> 06:09.394
Those Glee Clubbers are
so emotionally fragile,

06:09.412 --> 06:12.564
I can't help wonder
what this will do to them.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.583
With their dreams crushed,

06:14.617 --> 06:16.901
where and who will they be

06:16.919 --> 06:19.237
in just a few short months?

06:19.255 --> 06:21.739
I'm a drug mule
in the Lima crack district.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.658
I was forced to sell my legs
to science.

06:23.693 --> 06:25.333
I'm performing
on the bathhouse circuit.

06:25.334 --> 06:27.345
I'm a finance major at Brandeis.

06:27.380 --> 06:30.081
It turns out Glee Club
was really holding me back.

06:30.099 --> 06:33.135
Oh, I wish there was some way
to assuage my guilt.

06:33.186 --> 06:35.520
A sign that I was doing
the right thing.

06:35.555 --> 06:37.305
(knocking)

06:37.356 --> 06:39.758
Sue Sylvester?
I cannot thank you enough.

06:39.792 --> 06:42.677
I can't tell you
how much I hate those kids!

06:42.712 --> 06:45.090
Do you know how demeaning
it is when they just turn to you

06:45.091 --> 06:46.931
and yell, "Hit it!,"
and you're just supposed

06:46.949 --> 06:48.600
to know what song they're gonna sing?

06:48.618 --> 06:50.268
I'm free. Free.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.604
(school bell ringing)

06:52.638 --> 06:54.089
So, that's it?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.874
No more Glee? Until
next September.

06:55.908 --> 06:57.042
Sugar already bailed.

06:57.076 --> 06:59.044
Can I just say
what everyone is thinking?

06:59.078 --> 07:00.878
This is Marley's fault.
New Rachel, my butt.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.547
I knew Rachel Berry.

07:02.582 --> 07:03.999
I was friends with Rachel Berry,

07:04.050 --> 07:05.950
and you, Marley, are no Rachel Berry.
Mm-hmm.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.952
Preach. FINN: Guys,
guys, enough.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.362
It's not like it's over.
The holiday concert is later

07:10.363 --> 07:12.123
this week, and we are
going to be preparing

07:12.141 --> 07:13.391
for it all week long.

07:13.426 --> 07:15.393
If this is our swan song,

07:15.428 --> 07:17.629
let's make it the best one it can be.

07:17.647 --> 07:18.904
You really expect us to go up

07:18.905 --> 07:20.465
in front of the whole school and parade

07:20.483 --> 07:21.966
our loserdom for all to see?

07:21.984 --> 07:23.184
Yeah, Kitty does have a point.

07:23.185 --> 07:24.825
We agreed to do the show
when we thought

07:24.826 --> 07:27.066
it would be on the heels
of another Sectionals victory.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.573
Now it just feels like a pity party.

07:28.608 --> 07:30.733
I love to sing and dance
as much as anybody,

07:30.734 --> 07:32.694
but without a competition
to prep for, it's hard

07:32.728 --> 07:33.578
to get motivated.

07:33.613 --> 07:34.812
I understand that we need

07:34.830 --> 07:36.239
a little shift in perspective,

07:36.240 --> 07:38.200
but let's just enjoy this week,
and look forward

07:38.251 --> 07:40.318
to our big comeback next year.
That's right.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.454
What about those of us
who won't have a next year?

07:46.442 --> 07:48.426
(school bell ringing)

08:21.504 --> 08:23.371
It worked.
You found me.

08:23.389 --> 08:26.007
Did you lay out the
line of cereal for me?

08:26.008 --> 08:27.208
Well, it's Tuesday, and I know

08:27.209 --> 08:28.969
how you forget
to eat breakfast on Tuesdays

08:28.970 --> 08:31.330
'cause the first few days
of the week tend to confuse you.

08:31.331 --> 08:32.211
How did you know that?

08:32.212 --> 08:33.315
You told me.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.717
Is that mine? I think
maybe the reason

08:36.751 --> 08:39.256
why Santana was always
picking on me was because

08:39.258 --> 08:40.538
some part of her knew the truth.

08:40.573 --> 08:42.107
About Area 51?

08:42.158 --> 08:45.226
About that I'm totally into you.

08:45.261 --> 08:48.330
You're, uh, the only person
that really understands me.

08:48.364 --> 08:50.115
It's 'cause you're a genius.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.066
And most people don't
understand geniuses.

08:52.084 --> 08:54.068
Like most people
didn't appreciate Einstein

08:54.086 --> 08:56.071
or the Spice Girls
until it was too late.

08:56.105 --> 08:58.072
And I think that you know that I think

08:58.090 --> 09:01.926
that you are... pretty awesome.

09:01.961 --> 09:03.345
And your impressions are amazing.

09:03.379 --> 09:05.019
(like Elvis):
Well, thank you, Brittany.

09:05.020 --> 09:06.020
(laughs) I'm super bummed

09:06.021 --> 09:07.915
about Glee Club ending,
but I'm most sad

09:07.933 --> 09:10.635
that I never got the chance to
do a real love song with you.

09:10.686 --> 09:13.021
That's why I laid out
the path of cereal...

09:13.055 --> 09:15.089
so you could come in
here and sing with me.

09:15.107 --> 09:17.642
Is that why the band's here?

09:17.693 --> 09:19.644
You figured it all out.

09:19.695 --> 09:23.865
So, will you do me the honor
of singing a ballad with me?

09:23.899 --> 09:25.600
I love this song.

09:25.618 --> 09:27.569
("Something Stupid" begins)

09:35.878 --> 09:39.664
(in harmony): ♪ I know I stand
in line until you think ♪

09:39.715 --> 09:43.635
♪ You have the time
to spend an evening with me ♪

09:45.805 --> 09:48.173
♪ And if we go someplace to dance ♪

09:48.224 --> 09:52.761
♪ I know that there's a chance
you won't be leaving with me ♪

09:54.480 --> 09:59.067
♪ And afterwards we drop
into a quiet little place ♪

09:59.101 --> 10:02.771
♪ And have a drink or two

10:04.490 --> 10:06.474
♪ And then I go and spoil it all ♪

10:06.492 --> 10:11.246
♪ By saying something stupid
like "I love you" ♪

10:12.915 --> 10:15.316
♪ I can see it in your eyes

10:15.334 --> 10:17.318
♪ That you despise the same old lies ♪

10:17.336 --> 10:20.789
♪ You heard the night before

10:22.675 --> 10:25.093
♪ And though it's just a line to you ♪

10:25.127 --> 10:30.181
♪ For me it's true and never
seemed so right before ♪

♪ To make the meaning come through ♪

10:40.025 --> 10:42.844
♪ But then I go and spoil it all ♪

♪ By saying something stupid

♪ By saying something stupid
like "I love you" ♪

11:07.887 --> 11:11.473
♪ I love you

11:13.058 --> 11:15.727
♪ I love you

11:17.980 --> 11:22.567
♪ I... love you.

11:27.156 --> 11:29.390
(whispers):
I can't.

11:29.408 --> 11:30.608
Is it my lips?

11:30.659 --> 11:33.144
No. Your lips are so
soft and horizontal.

11:33.179 --> 11:35.280
I just like you too much
to put you in danger.

11:35.331 --> 11:36.898
Santana broke up with you.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.232
No, it's not just Santana.

11:38.250 --> 11:41.068
It's, like, all the
lesbians of the nation,

11:41.086 --> 11:42.587
and I don't know how they found out

11:42.621 --> 11:44.122
about Santana and I dating,

11:44.156 --> 11:46.674
but once they did, they started
sending me, like, tweets,

11:46.709 --> 11:48.993
and Facebook messages on
Lord Tubbington's wall.

11:49.028 --> 11:50.228
I think it means a lot to them

11:50.229 --> 11:52.514
to see two super-hot,
popular girls in love,

11:52.548 --> 11:55.416
and I worry if they find
out about you and I dating,

11:55.434 --> 11:57.802
that they'll turn on you
and get really violent

11:57.853 --> 12:00.588
and hurt your beautiful face and mouth.

12:00.606 --> 12:02.473
I'm not scared of them.

12:04.226 --> 12:06.928
I know, uh, yeah...

12:06.946 --> 12:08.363
Um, thanks for the song

12:08.397 --> 12:10.315
and breakfast was great,
but I just can't.

♪

12:32.471 --> 12:33.788
Knees back, Schwimmer.

12:33.806 --> 12:35.006
Knees...

12:35.057 --> 12:36.290
Can I go get a sip of water?

12:36.308 --> 12:37.559
Of course.

12:37.593 --> 12:39.126
Of course, yeah.

12:39.144 --> 12:40.395
Stop.

12:41.497 --> 12:42.814
Everybody, stop.

12:42.848 --> 12:43.928
Because that's what happens

12:43.933 --> 12:46.734
when you're thirsty on Broadway.

12:46.769 --> 12:48.803
You see, they stop the show

12:48.821 --> 12:51.773
so that mommy can hand you a sippy cup.

my butt off in this class,

13:02.084 --> 13:03.751
Hmm. And I have gotten better.

13:03.786 --> 13:05.506
Three months in,
you still have no stamina

13:05.537 --> 13:07.255
no precision, and you think

13:07.289 --> 13:10.157
you can outperform Alexandra
Blasucci at the Showcase?

13:10.175 --> 13:12.493
That girl was born in toe shoes.

13:12.511 --> 13:14.212
You won't even be able to keep up.

13:14.263 --> 13:16.163
I've kept up with you.

13:16.181 --> 13:18.216
Oh. All right.

13:18.267 --> 13:21.769
I-I just meant, with everything
that you've thrown at me...

13:21.804 --> 13:24.606
I don't throw things...
I teach.

13:24.640 --> 13:28.359
Nothing I do here is random
or unintentional.

13:28.394 --> 13:30.634
It's not my fault that you
don't understand my methods.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.205
And it's not my fault that you
don't see how good I've become.

13:33.206 --> 13:34.282
Okay.

13:34.316 --> 13:37.184
Would you like to show me
how good you've become?

13:37.202 --> 13:39.186
Show me that I'm not wasting my time?

Fine.

You're not good enough yet.

16:18.063 --> 16:19.847
Maybe you're right.

Oh! Oh, you're finally
learning something in here.

16:25.788 --> 16:27.572

16:27.623 --> 16:29.457
maybe even better.

16:29.491 --> 16:31.576
You think anyone in here believes that?

16:31.627 --> 16:33.744
Because there's a big difference

16:33.796 --> 16:35.413
between self-confidence
and delusion.

16:35.464 --> 16:37.582
No one else has to believe it.

16:37.633 --> 16:39.467
No one but me.

16:39.501 --> 16:41.535
But... thank you.

16:41.553 --> 16:43.871
You actually did teach me
something, which is that

16:43.889 --> 16:45.556
if I'm going to win this showcase,

16:45.591 --> 16:47.925
the only way I'm gonna do it
is with my voice.

16:54.178 --> 16:56.062
Where are we putting Scott Rudin?

16:56.873 --> 16:58.106
That's where you have him?

16:58.124 --> 16:59.491
You need to put him over here.

16:59.542 --> 17:00.509
As a matter of fact,

17:00.543 --> 17:01.843
you need to redo all of this.

17:01.878 --> 17:02.828
(knock at door)

17:02.879 --> 17:04.329
Madame Tibideaux?

17:04.380 --> 17:05.464
I hope it's all right

17:05.498 --> 17:08.333
that I'm dropping by your office.

17:08.384 --> 17:10.185
I-I'm not sure that
you, uh, remember me...

17:10.219 --> 17:11.618
What can I do for
you, Mr. Hummel?

17:11.619 --> 17:13.338
Oh, uh,

17:13.388 --> 17:15.007
I-I applied for
the second semester...

17:15.040 --> 17:16.241
I received it.
I reviewed it.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.109
And the accompanying video?

17:18.144 --> 17:19.645
Of you doing the acoustic version

17:19.679 --> 17:22.180
of WHAM!'s "Wake Me Up
Before You Go-Go"?

17:22.231 --> 17:24.049
What'd you think?

17:24.083 --> 17:26.603
I thought exactly what I thought
the first time you auditioned

17:26.604 --> 17:27.635
for me last Spring.

17:27.654 --> 17:29.637
"Here's a very talented young man

17:29.656 --> 17:32.307
"who knows how to sell a number,

17:32.325 --> 17:35.310
but who is devoid
of complexity and depth."

17:35.345 --> 17:37.729
What?
You gave me

17:37.764 --> 17:38.980
surface...

17:38.998 --> 17:41.649
when I was looking for soul.

17:41.668 --> 17:45.370
We are training artists
here, Mr. Hummel.

17:45.421 --> 17:47.781
Performers who are not afraid
to show their vulnerability,

17:47.782 --> 17:50.876
and yes, even their heart.

17:50.927 --> 17:53.245
Madame Tibideaux, I-I-I-I-I have
all of those things.

17:53.279 --> 17:55.997
I rarely give anyone a second chance,

17:56.015 --> 17:58.417
and when I do, it is on my terms.

17:58.451 --> 18:01.219
Now, thank you for your
continued interest in NYADA,

18:01.270 --> 18:03.505
but as you can see, I'm busy preparing

18:03.539 --> 18:05.006
for the Winter Showcase.

18:05.024 --> 18:06.441
Good afternoon, Mr. Hummel.

18:11.197 --> 18:13.532
(school bell rings)

18:14.450 --> 18:16.401
Oh, hell no.

18:16.452 --> 18:17.685
What happened to you?

18:17.704 --> 18:19.664
I joined the marching band.
I'm the drum leader.

18:19.665 --> 18:20.688
What happened to you?

18:20.707 --> 18:22.214
We joined the Cheerios!

18:22.215 --> 18:24.055
We had to do something.
It's our senior year.

18:24.090 --> 18:26.170
We wanted to compete.
We want to be part of a team.

18:26.171 --> 18:27.491
And Coach Sylvester just let you?

18:27.492 --> 18:29.197
It was way easier than I thought.

18:29.215 --> 18:30.298
I'm gonna be blunt.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.217
<i>60 Minutes</i> is doing a piece on me,

18:32.251 --> 18:34.252
and that Leslie Stahl is
gonna to bring the heat.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.538
I could use a handsome,
non-flammable gay

18:36.556 --> 18:39.091
to articulate how my defeating
the Glee Club once and for all

18:39.142 --> 18:40.559
and absorbing its budget

18:40.593 --> 18:42.877
was actually the best thing
that ever happened to him.

18:42.895 --> 18:44.879
And my squad's looking
a little pale these days.

18:44.897 --> 18:47.716
Wouldn't hurt to add
a dash of Yellow ♪4

18:47.750 --> 18:49.384
to my championship cheer batter.

18:49.419 --> 18:50.867
I get what you're saying.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.428
It's weird to suddenly feel like
you're not a part of anything.

18:53.429 --> 18:55.109
That's why we joined
the basketball team.

18:55.110 --> 18:55.390
Oh, no,

18:55.391 --> 18:57.111
that's why you joined
the basketball team.

18:57.145 --> 18:59.585
I joined the basketball team
because I'm good at basketball.

19:00.696 --> 19:01.696
Uh...

19:04.033 --> 19:05.567
That's right.

19:05.585 --> 19:08.120
Uh-huh.

19:08.171 --> 19:10.905
I joined the McKinley
Floor Hockey Team.

19:10.923 --> 19:12.843
And when I slip a wig
underneath the face mask,

19:12.844 --> 19:13.959
nobody will be the wiser.

19:13.993 --> 19:15.410
Hallelu.

19:15.428 --> 19:16.988
Who knew this school had so many clubs?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.894
I joined the Interfaith
Paintball League,

19:18.895 --> 19:20.415
where Christians, Jews and Muslims can

19:20.433 --> 19:22.750
shoot at each other safely.

19:22.769 --> 19:24.469
(spattering)

19:29.859 --> 19:31.868
Well, it looks like we've
all sort of moved on,

19:31.869 --> 19:34.429
which just leaves one question:
When are we going to tell Finn?

19:34.464 --> 19:37.032
(school bell rings)

19:37.066 --> 19:40.435
I can't believe it's been,
like, what, two days,

19:40.470 --> 19:42.937
that you've all gone
in completely separate,

19:42.955 --> 19:44.322
and totally insane, directions.

19:44.373 --> 19:46.274
We lost Sectionals.

19:46.309 --> 19:47.275
Our season is over.

19:47.293 --> 19:48.853
You can't be upset that we've moved on.

19:48.871 --> 19:50.031
It's the healthy thing to do.

19:50.032 --> 19:50.629
Is it really?

19:50.663 --> 19:51.830
Is it the healthy thing to do

19:51.881 --> 19:53.281
to take orders from Sue Sylvester

19:53.316 --> 19:55.000
for the rest of the school year?

19:55.034 --> 19:56.001
And Artie, man,

19:56.052 --> 19:57.219
you basically dragged me

19:57.253 --> 19:59.454
out of the tire shop,
telling me that this club was

19:59.472 --> 20:00.722
part of my destiny somehow.

20:00.756 --> 20:01.956
What did you even join?

20:01.974 --> 20:03.725
Your costume is ridiculous.

20:03.759 --> 20:05.510
I looks like a peacock
died on your head.

20:05.545 --> 20:06.378
It's called a plume.

20:06.412 --> 20:07.423
Whatever! Okay, look,

20:07.424 --> 20:09.064
I-I'm not going to waste
all six minutes

20:09.065 --> 20:10.545
I was able to book the auditorium for

20:10.546 --> 20:11.449
yelling at you guys.

20:11.484 --> 20:12.951
Six minutes?
Yeah.

20:12.985 --> 20:14.129
Emperor Sylvester swooped in

20:14.130 --> 20:15.970
and carved the reservation
hours into tenths.

20:15.988 --> 20:18.139
So the only other time
I was able to get

20:18.157 --> 20:20.225
was 9:54, Friday night,

20:20.259 --> 20:22.577
and I'll be here ready to rehearse,

20:22.612 --> 20:24.396
and I hope you will, too.

20:24.430 --> 20:25.380
'Cause if you don't,

20:25.381 --> 20:26.581
I think you're going to regret

20:26.616 --> 20:28.867
missing that opportunity
for the rest of your lives.

20:28.901 --> 20:29.868
I'll definitely be here.

20:29.919 --> 20:31.536
Yeah, well, we'd all be here

20:31.587 --> 20:33.655
if you hadn't face-planted
at Sectionals.

20:33.673 --> 20:34.923
Tina, enough.

20:47.770 --> 20:49.437
(speaking quietly)

21:01.400 --> 21:06.788
(light switches clicking, clanking)

21:08.307 --> 21:10.575
(school bell rings)

21:10.610 --> 21:12.127
Hey.
Oh.

21:12.161 --> 21:14.281
Can I ask you a question?
Oh, <i>The Walking Dead</i> isn't

21:14.282 --> 21:15.962
based on a true story.
I already checked.

21:15.963 --> 21:18.366
That's not what I was
gonna ask, but, oh.

21:18.384 --> 21:19.718
No, thanks.

21:19.752 --> 21:21.052
Are you planning on going

21:21.087 --> 21:23.054
to the holiday concert
rehearsal on Friday?

21:23.089 --> 21:25.056
Why?

21:25.091 --> 21:26.708
Well, I pulled some strings

21:26.726 --> 21:30.362
and I got us reservation
for the VIP booth at Breadstix,

21:30.396 --> 21:32.564
but the only time
they had available was

21:32.598 --> 21:35.133
for the same time as rehearsal.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.735
So, do you want to go?

21:36.769 --> 21:39.821
You mean, like... on a date?

21:39.855 --> 21:42.991
Yeah, well, I was thinking
about what Finn said

21:43.025 --> 21:44.910
about last chances,
Mm-hmm.

21:44.944 --> 21:47.262
And how everyone's
joining all these clubs

21:47.296 --> 21:48.914
because they don't want to miss out,

21:48.948 --> 21:53.585
and the truth is, is that
ever since Santana left,

21:53.619 --> 21:55.654
you're the only person
that makes me smile.

21:55.688 --> 21:57.455
I am pretty
non-stop hilarious.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.660
You make me happy, Sam,

22:01.694 --> 22:03.762
And I don't want to waste any more time

22:03.796 --> 22:05.480
not smiling at your hilariousness.

22:09.635 --> 22:11.315
What about the lesbian
blogger community?

22:11.316 --> 22:12.437
They're not gonna like it,

22:12.471 --> 22:14.189
but the way I figure is that

22:14.223 --> 22:15.473
they know they're my sisters

22:15.524 --> 22:16.950
and love is love.

22:27.820 --> 22:31.323
(like Forrest Gump): I may not be a
smart man, but I know what love is.

22:35.119 --> 22:39.422
(chamber orchestra tuning up)

22:40.708 --> 22:47.263
(instruments quiet)

22:47.298 --> 22:50.600
Welcome to the New York
Academy of Dramatic Arts'

22:50.634 --> 22:53.269
annual Winter Showcase.

22:53.304 --> 22:55.755
While this is a competition,

22:55.773 --> 22:58.090
it is also a celebration.

22:58.108 --> 23:01.194
Each year, our faculty
chooses ten students

23:01.228 --> 23:03.363
who exemplify the best

23:03.397 --> 23:05.598
of what we are trying to achieve.

23:05.616 --> 23:07.984
Our first performer is Alexandra.

23:08.035 --> 23:09.452
Blasucci.

23:09.486 --> 23:12.772
She will be doing Delibes' <i>Sylvia</i>

23:12.790 --> 23:16.492
with variations
by Sir Frederick Ashton.

23:16.543 --> 23:18.544
(applause)

23:25.469 --> 23:27.971
(orchestra playing lively,
dramatic selection from <i>Sylvia</i> )

23:31.926 --> 23:32.976
Hey.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.144
Hey. Hi.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.630
You're nervous.

23:37.665 --> 23:39.732
I was, too, at my first showcase.

23:39.767 --> 23:41.748
Just... remember what I said

23:41.749 --> 23:43.069
when we first met...
you're here

23:43.103 --> 23:44.604
because you're the best of the best.

23:45.673 --> 23:47.139
What?
Well, that's very sweet.

23:47.157 --> 23:48.357
That was a very good pep talk.

23:48.359 --> 23:49.158
I don't know.

23:49.193 --> 23:50.810
I feel like I...
like I got this.

23:50.828 --> 23:51.861
You know?

23:52.947 --> 23:55.498
Look, I-I know I may not be a...

23:55.532 --> 23:57.417
like, a typical beauty, and...

23:57.451 --> 24:00.086
no one's gonna ever pay me to
walk the runway on Fashion Week

24:00.120 --> 24:03.656
or I'm not gonna cure cancer,
write the Great American Novel,

24:03.691 --> 24:06.426
but if you give me a stage to sing on,

24:06.460 --> 24:10.196
I know, in my gut, that there's
no one that can beat me.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.548
I... can't believe
you can be so calm.

24:12.599 --> 24:14.434
(chuckling):
Oh, my God... I'm terrified!

24:15.436 --> 24:17.603
But, um, I know who I am and I know

24:17.638 --> 24:18.938
what I'm gonna do.

24:18.973 --> 24:22.058
I'm just gonna go out there like...

24:22.109 --> 24:25.061
I'm never gonna get
a chance to sing again.

24:25.112 --> 24:26.729
Well, I may not be able to cure

24:26.780 --> 24:28.898
anything either,
but I'm smart enough to know...

24:28.949 --> 24:31.234
never get in the way
of a woman on a mission.

24:31.285 --> 24:32.902
So...

24:33.988 --> 24:34.737
...break a leg.

24:43.497 --> 24:45.131
What was that for?

24:45.165 --> 24:47.199
I think I'm just gonna
start doing things

24:47.217 --> 24:49.202
like I'm never gonna
get another chance to.

24:49.236 --> 24:50.202
KURT:
Hey!

24:50.220 --> 24:51.587
Uh, as sympathetic as I am

24:51.609 --> 24:53.089
at this particular act
of a rom-com,

24:53.140 --> 24:54.140
Rachel, you're up.

24:58.062 --> 25:01.731
Our next performer is
from the freshman class.

25:01.765 --> 25:04.050
Please welcome Miss Rachel Berry.

25:04.068 --> 25:06.102
(applause)

25:11.742 --> 25:13.609
Hi, I'm Rachel Berry, and, um...

25:13.660 --> 25:16.079
I'm just going to...
sing for you.

Rachel, that was wonderful.

30:59.089 --> 31:00.456
No...

31:00.507 --> 31:02.241
it was superb.

31:02.259 --> 31:05.010
And now we're going to have
a brief intermission,

31:05.045 --> 31:07.463
and when we come back,
if he thinks he's ready,

31:07.514 --> 31:08.964
we'll have a performance...

31:09.015 --> 31:10.549
from Mr. Hummel.

31:18.425 --> 31:20.524
Carmen Tibideaux is an insane person.

31:20.548 --> 31:21.285
Asking me to sing

31:21.286 --> 31:22.766
in front of the entire NYADA faculty?

31:22.817 --> 31:23.934
And all those theatrical

31:23.985 --> 31:26.103
luminaries? I mean,
why would she do that?

31:26.154 --> 31:28.194
She's giving you a second chance
at your audition.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.380
She just wants to see how
you perform under pressure.

31:30.381 --> 31:32.359
I'm gonna fail,
that's what's gonna happen.

31:32.393 --> 31:34.828
Uh... I have nothing prepared.
Oh, my God.

31:34.863 --> 31:36.413
You have an entire repertoire.

31:36.447 --> 31:39.283
I guess I could do "Wishing
You Were Somehow Here Again"?

31:39.334 --> 31:40.894
No <i>Phantom,</i> not in front of this crowd.

31:40.902 --> 31:43.203
"With One Look"?
<i>Sunset Boulevard?</i> Same thing.

31:43.237 --> 31:45.255
(sighs) "Being Alive"?

31:45.290 --> 31:46.924
Yes.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.675
Oh, my God, I just got chills.

31:48.710 --> 31:50.470
That's perfect!
There's only one problem...

31:50.471 --> 31:52.296
I think that's a song that Carmen hates

31:52.347 --> 31:54.548
and I can't do it
without a costume or props!

31:54.582 --> 31:56.183
You don't need any of that stuff!

31:56.217 --> 31:57.817
Yes, I do.
You know that I'm at my best

31:57.818 --> 31:59.538
when I have my careful
assortment of bells

31:59.539 --> 32:02.806
and whistles, like steel
scaffolding or my gold lamé pants.

32:02.857 --> 32:04.141
Kurt.

32:04.192 --> 32:05.776
You said it yourself...

32:05.810 --> 32:09.196
that is exactly what Carmen
does not want to see.

32:10.481 --> 32:13.617
You know when you were
your absolute best?

32:13.651 --> 32:15.369
My favorite performance ever?

32:15.403 --> 32:17.871
When you sang "I Want to Hold
Your Hand" in the choir room.

32:17.906 --> 32:19.573
It was so...

32:19.607 --> 32:20.657
just simple

32:20.708 --> 32:23.327
and emotional and...
I don't know, I...

32:23.378 --> 32:25.629
I get chills every time
I think about it.

32:25.663 --> 32:26.964
Do you remember that?

32:26.998 --> 32:28.048
(sighs)

32:28.082 --> 32:29.800
Of course I do.

32:29.834 --> 32:32.114
But things were different...
my dad was in the hospital.

32:32.115 --> 32:33.503
I dedicated it to him.

32:33.554 --> 32:35.722
Who am I supposed
to dedicate this to? Carmen?

32:35.757 --> 32:37.624
To yourself.

NYADA student.

32:58.579 --> 33:01.448
Tonight I am going to perform a song

33:01.482 --> 33:03.417
that I've loved since I was six.

33:03.451 --> 33:05.118
But, um...

33:05.152 --> 33:08.121
I think for the
first time in my life, I...

33:08.155 --> 33:11.157
finally understand what it means.

36:38.887 --> 36:40.954
Rachel, it's Finn.
You butt-dialed me again.

36:40.972 --> 36:43.336
Oh, I... I didn't...
I didn't butt-dial you.

36:43.371 --> 36:44.672
I just, um...

36:44.706 --> 36:47.474
I wanted to hear your voice.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.476
Especially after...

36:49.511 --> 36:51.512
Hearing we lost?

36:51.546 --> 36:52.846
That everyone's giving up

36:52.881 --> 36:53.647
and moving on?

36:53.682 --> 36:55.149
It's over.

36:55.183 --> 36:56.817
We're done competing for the year.

36:56.851 --> 36:59.270
Finn, Glee Club isn't
just about competing.

36:59.321 --> 37:01.272
You kidding me?
You live to compete.

37:01.323 --> 37:03.324
Kurt told me
you were competing tonight.

37:04.409 --> 37:06.410
How'd it go?

37:08.896 --> 37:11.165
I won.

37:14.669 --> 37:16.620
Great.

37:16.671 --> 37:18.706
That's...

37:18.740 --> 37:21.842
Wow, uh... congratulations.

37:21.876 --> 37:25.179
Finn, listen to me.

37:25.213 --> 37:29.216
You know, even if we...
we never won our Sectionals,

37:29.250 --> 37:32.536
or Nationals had never happened...

37:32.571 --> 37:36.390
it still would have been worth it.

37:36.424 --> 37:38.392
I mean, Glee... it's...

37:38.426 --> 37:40.561
it's about the love of music.

37:40.595 --> 37:44.698
It's about people like Puck and Artie

37:44.733 --> 37:47.934
not just singing together,
but actually being friends.

37:47.953 --> 37:50.771
And Brittany and Mike dancing
just for fun

37:50.789 --> 37:52.790
when no one else is around.

37:54.726 --> 37:57.944
It's even about the romances.

37:57.963 --> 38:00.581
You know, they come and go, but...

38:00.615 --> 38:02.616
they're just as important.

38:09.924 --> 38:13.093
Look, those kids...
they respect you so much.

38:13.127 --> 38:15.095
And they look up to you, so...

38:15.129 --> 38:17.431
don't let them give up on their dreams.

38:17.465 --> 38:19.433
Okay?

38:19.467 --> 38:21.585
Promise me one thing.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.555
Don't give up on yours.

38:25.807 --> 38:28.409
Okay?

38:28.443 --> 38:30.444
(beep)

38:32.580 --> 38:34.948
(sighs heavily)

38:57.022 --> 38:59.005
No one else is coming, are they?

38:59.024 --> 39:01.208
I don't think so.

39:03.111 --> 39:06.730
I had some good news for us, but
maybe it doesn't matter anymore.

39:06.781 --> 39:09.099
I found a place where
Glee Club can practice.

39:09.134 --> 39:10.901
It's not great, but

39:10.952 --> 39:13.370
I know for a fact
that no one can kick us out.

39:17.042 --> 39:19.043

Marley, don't.

No, I mean it.

You've being so nice about
this, but it's my fault.

40:30.565 --> 40:32.599
I was...

40:32.617 --> 40:37.037
naive and insecure
and self-centered,

40:37.071 --> 40:39.105
