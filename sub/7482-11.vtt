WEBVTT

00:04.419 --> 00:06.183
Sweetheart, just try it.

00:06.354 --> 00:07.651
They're not fried leaves.

00:10.625 --> 00:13.117
It doesn't make any sense
to me either.

00:19.467 --> 00:22.562
Here, try a bite of mine.

00:31.946 --> 00:34.142
That was a pretty big bite. Ha-ha-ha.

00:40.788 --> 00:41.812
Be right back.

00:43.358 --> 00:45.190
Too much coffee.

00:57.172 --> 00:58.503
FBI!

00:58.673 --> 00:59.970
- FBI.
- Don't move!

01:00.141 --> 01:01.734
- Downstairs.
- Stay in your seats.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.277
- Stay where you are.
- Stay down. Don't move.

01:04.444 --> 01:05.708
What the hell is going on?

01:09.984 --> 01:11.474
Federal agents. FBI.

01:17.992 --> 01:19.357
- Bathroom, clear.
- Go.

01:26.701 --> 01:28.294
We're clear.

01:31.472 --> 01:33.668
- He's gone?
- Afraid so, ma'am.

02:08.977 --> 02:10.570
Is this how we're working out now?

02:11.212 --> 02:13.909
I'm just resting between sets.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.979
- You taught me that.
- Right.

02:17.151 --> 02:20.246
- Just taking a little power nap.
- You were snoring.

02:20.421 --> 02:22.501
I'm not snoring.
Those were deep breathing exercises.

02:22.657 --> 02:24.056
Something you also taught me.

02:24.225 --> 02:27.889
You know, this is the third morning
this week I caught you here resting.

02:28.062 --> 02:30.224
What can I tell you?
I'm always in the gym.

02:30.398 --> 02:32.025
Just trying to stay
lean and mean, baby.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.396
- Ha, ha. No, I'm always in the gym.
- Uh-huh.

02:34.569 --> 02:37.539
You know you have a house now.
You can sleep there.

02:37.705 --> 02:39.585
- That's what normal people do.
- I sleep there.

02:40.608 --> 02:42.201
I do.

02:42.377 --> 02:45.278
You're like a cat that keeps going back
even though the owners moved.

02:45.446 --> 02:47.972
What do you want me to say?
I'm a creature of habit.

02:48.316 --> 02:50.978
Yeah, you're a creature, all right.

02:51.152 --> 02:52.551
Of bad habits.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.246
What is your deal this morning?

02:55.556 --> 02:57.251
Did the kids eat your Cocoa Puffs
again?

02:57.425 --> 03:00.918
- Don't go trying to change the sub...
- Ahem, ahem.

03:01.629 --> 03:04.121
- What the...?
- Good morning.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.667
Sorry to interrupt your workout,
gentlemen.

03:09.837 --> 03:11.805
- We weren't working out.
- I was working out.

03:11.973 --> 03:13.600
- He was sleeping.
- Resting.

03:13.775 --> 03:15.470
We have a case.

03:24.252 --> 03:26.414
I'm not sure
I'm comfortable with this.

03:26.587 --> 03:28.749
She's already in three places
at once.

03:28.923 --> 03:30.618
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Heh.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.124
I can still hear you, gentlemen.

03:37.832 --> 03:40.324
Embrace the future.

03:42.036 --> 03:44.937
Today's special is former
Romanian Communist leader,

03:45.106 --> 03:48.201
and suspected war criminal,
Anton Zevlos.

03:48.643 --> 03:51.908
He allegedly helped mastermind
Romania's human trafficking ring.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.980
Now, there was already a market
for young women,

03:54.148 --> 03:57.140
but Zevlos used his position
to create false adoption papers

03:57.318 --> 03:59.548
for the trafficking
of children and babies.

03:59.721 --> 04:03.180
Now, a lot of those adopted kids
ended up being used as organ donors.

04:03.358 --> 04:05.122
At least that's the rumor.

04:05.293 --> 04:06.385
Zevlos disappeared

04:06.561 --> 04:09.553
after Romania's Communist regime
fell in '89,

04:09.731 --> 04:12.029
but Romania believes
he's been living in Los Angeles...

04:12.200 --> 04:15.135
under an assumed identity,
John Vasile,

04:15.303 --> 04:16.668
for the last 20 years.

04:16.838 --> 04:18.772
How did he go so long
without being found?

04:18.940 --> 04:21.637
I mean, it can't be that hard
to track down one Romanian ex-pat.

04:21.809 --> 04:23.299
It is if no one's looking for you.

04:23.478 --> 04:26.345
The Romanian government wasn't
even sure he'd ever left the country.

04:26.848 --> 04:28.873
Lots of war criminals
stayed behind in Romania

04:29.050 --> 04:30.677
after Ceausescu was overthrown.

04:31.085 --> 04:32.382
They got generous pensions,

04:32.553 --> 04:34.851
luxury apartments
for their service to the republic.

04:35.022 --> 04:37.022
It doesn't help
that there's still strong nostalgia

04:37.191 --> 04:38.681
for the Communist era back there.

04:38.860 --> 04:41.727
That's part of why Romania
basically ignored its brutal past.

04:41.896 --> 04:42.954
Until now.

04:43.131 --> 04:46.260
Romania finally wants to bring charges
against their war criminals.

04:46.434 --> 04:48.334
And they want us to deliver Zevlos.

04:48.503 --> 04:49.698
Well, now, they do.

04:49.871 --> 04:51.751
They initially went
through the State Department

04:51.906 --> 04:54.034
who sent the FBI to bring him in.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.573
That didn't go so well.

04:55.743 --> 04:57.404
Zevlos walked out
on his wife and kid,

04:57.578 --> 05:00.639
and left the restaurant moments
before the SWAT team moved in.

05:00.815 --> 05:03.580
Now we've been asked
to help find him, help finish the job.

05:03.751 --> 05:06.015
Well, so much
for the element of surprise.

05:06.187 --> 05:08.349
Yeah. Now that Zevlos knows
we're after him,

05:08.523 --> 05:10.514
he's not gonna come up for air
many more times.

05:11.626 --> 05:14.118
Well, let's make this one count.

05:14.295 --> 05:16.161
Start with his wife.

05:19.534 --> 05:21.969
Hey, uh, do you want me
to ride with you guys?

05:22.136 --> 05:24.216
- We're taking the Challenger.
- I think we got this.

05:24.372 --> 05:26.636
- Oh. Okay.
- We'll call you if we find something.

05:26.808 --> 05:29.243
Or if you need backup,
because if you need me, I'll be there.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.139
- I'll be there, like, uh...
- Uh-huh.

05:31.312 --> 05:32.336
- Cool.
- Yup.

05:32.513 --> 05:33.571
Like, boom!

05:33.748 --> 05:35.238
If you need...

05:38.553 --> 05:40.043
Okay.

05:48.429 --> 05:50.261
Maybe we should
have brought Deeks along.

05:50.431 --> 05:51.796
For what?

05:51.966 --> 05:53.434
Uh, I don't know.

05:53.601 --> 05:55.797
Clearly, the guy's a little lost
without his partner.

05:55.970 --> 05:59.338
Oh, I get it. You're feeling bad for him.
You feel like you gotta go easy on him.

05:59.507 --> 06:02.306
- You've lost your favorite chew toy.
- The guy's been through a lot.

06:02.477 --> 06:04.309
- And he saved my wife's life.
- Once.

06:04.479 --> 06:06.607
I've saved your life,
what, a hundred times?

06:06.781 --> 06:08.271
- A hundred?
- How many?

06:08.449 --> 06:12.352
Not a hundred. And definitely not
as many times as I've saved your life.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.249
Are you kidding me?

06:14.455 --> 06:16.617
I've saved your life
more times than you've saved mine.

06:16.791 --> 06:19.192
- No way. Stop it.
- Fact of life, baby.

06:21.162 --> 06:22.755
- Good morning.
- Morning.

06:22.930 --> 06:25.365
Agents Hanna and Callen, NCIS.

06:26.567 --> 06:30.026
Carla Shear.
I'm the Vasiles' attorney. Please.

06:30.204 --> 06:32.468
Thank you. Not a hundred.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.698
Dreaming.

06:35.510 --> 06:37.376
This has to be a misunderstanding.

06:38.646 --> 06:41.411
I wish it were, for your sake, ma'am.

06:41.849 --> 06:45.149
But your husband's real name
is Anton Zevlos.

06:47.154 --> 06:49.885
He is wanted for war crimes
he committed as a high-ranking official

06:50.057 --> 06:51.923
in Communist Romania.

06:52.326 --> 06:56.126
No, no, see, you have it backwards.

06:56.597 --> 06:59.862
John came to America
to flee Ceausescu.

07:00.034 --> 07:02.196
He was penniless.

07:02.370 --> 07:05.396
He left everything behind
for a chance at a better life.

07:05.573 --> 07:07.803
Found his way
into commercial real estate,

07:07.975 --> 07:10.706
and look what he's achieved.

07:10.878 --> 07:13.506
Classic American dream.

07:13.814 --> 07:15.077
He's a real inspiration.

07:16.651 --> 07:17.675
Agent Callen, you realize

07:17.852 --> 07:19.843
you are conducting a search
without a warrant.

07:20.021 --> 07:22.388
We're just trying to help the missus
find her husband.

07:22.557 --> 07:24.855
I thought you said you were looking
for a war criminal.

07:25.026 --> 07:26.118
Same thing.

07:26.294 --> 07:29.525
My husband is not a war criminal.

07:38.039 --> 07:40.269
What have we got here?

07:49.984 --> 07:51.645
You were saying?

08:08.835 --> 08:12.465
How's Mrs. Zevlos... Vasile, doing?

08:12.639 --> 08:16.473
I'm seeing some trust issues
and some therapy in her future.

08:16.643 --> 08:18.372
She claims
this was his personal space.

08:18.545 --> 08:19.979
She never came in here.

08:21.514 --> 08:23.141
What we get?

08:23.683 --> 08:27.551
About September of 1998,
Zevlos felt like he was being watched.

08:27.721 --> 08:28.761
He started keeping records

08:28.922 --> 08:30.802
of anyone around him
who he felt was suspicious.

08:31.257 --> 08:33.953
Healthy dose of paranoia
doesn't hurt,

08:34.126 --> 08:36.619
especially when you're a war criminal
in hiding.

08:36.796 --> 08:39.059
Liked to keep tabs on his friends.

08:39.232 --> 08:40.631
His enemies too.

08:41.701 --> 08:44.500
Not to mention enough arms
to start a small war.

08:45.538 --> 08:47.768
Looks like he took two of those
with him.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.137
Armed and psychotic.

08:50.644 --> 08:51.736
Perfect.

08:53.179 --> 08:54.442
Here itis.

08:54.614 --> 08:58.744
John Vasile died
of necrotizing enterocolitis in 1993

08:58.918 --> 08:59.976
at the age of six months.

09:00.153 --> 09:03.350
- Zevlos must've assumed his identity.
- That old chestnut.

09:04.157 --> 09:05.420
What else we got?

09:06.126 --> 09:09.824
Well, uh, Callen and Sam found
a secret stash of files and weapons

09:09.996 --> 09:11.691
at Zevlos'-slash-Vasile's house.

09:11.865 --> 09:13.299
Now we're cooking. What else?

09:13.466 --> 09:15.867
That's all we're working with
at the moment.

09:16.603 --> 09:17.900
Okay. All right. No worries.

09:18.071 --> 09:20.472
Let's, uh, change gears for a second,
shall we?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.734
Let's try something else.
Where is, uh...?

09:22.909 --> 09:24.570
Where's Kensi right now?

09:24.744 --> 09:26.337
We don't know.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.104
We don't.

09:28.281 --> 09:31.808
No, I mean, I get it, it's classified,
but how do we get in touch with her?

09:31.985 --> 09:33.180
I don't think we can.

09:33.353 --> 09:35.651
Right, of course,
and I'm not suggesting that we do,

09:35.822 --> 09:38.621
but if I were to need
to speak with her...

09:38.792 --> 09:39.953
Yeah, you couldn't.

09:41.327 --> 09:42.488
Mr. Deeks.

09:42.662 --> 09:44.494
Yes, Hetty.

09:44.998 --> 09:48.525
Aah. Danger, Will Robinson.
What the hell is that?

09:48.702 --> 09:51.831
It's advanced telepresence.

09:52.005 --> 09:56.238
It allows me
to be in several places at once.

09:56.409 --> 09:59.538
I'd like to see you in my office,
Mr. Deeks.

10:15.361 --> 10:16.487
Ma'am.

10:19.799 --> 10:22.063
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

10:57.036 --> 10:58.401
Hey.

11:00.807 --> 11:02.775
- Hi there.
- Hey.

11:08.782 --> 11:12.548
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Hi. I'm Kensi Blye.

11:13.319 --> 11:16.448
Rachel Harris. Are you...?
You looking for someone?

11:16.890 --> 11:17.982
I was told to report here.

11:18.491 --> 11:20.459
Uh, okay. By whom?

11:20.927 --> 11:22.087
By Assistant Director Granger

11:22.228 --> 11:23.787
and my operations manager
Hetty Lange.

11:25.231 --> 11:27.928
- You work for Hetty?
- Yeah.

11:28.401 --> 11:30.267
What's that like?

11:31.070 --> 11:33.630
- It's interesting.
- I bet.

11:33.807 --> 11:36.640
- You know what your assignment is?
- No.

11:37.577 --> 11:39.739
Well, that makes two of us.

11:39.913 --> 11:41.506
Anyone here got a heads up

11:41.681 --> 11:45.413
on the arrival of Special Agent...

11:45.585 --> 11:46.984
- Blye.
- Blye?

11:47.153 --> 11:48.746
- No.
- Mm-mm.

11:50.190 --> 11:51.589
Am I about to be replaced?

11:51.758 --> 11:55.126
I don't think so. I have a partner and
ongoing cases in Los Angeles, so...

11:56.296 --> 12:00.062
All right, well,
um, make yourself at home,

12:00.233 --> 12:04.136
and I will try and figure out
what's going on.

12:04.304 --> 12:06.329
Okay. Thanks.

12:09.008 --> 12:12.308
- How are you, Mr. Deeks?
- I'm good.

12:12.879 --> 12:15.007
I'm really good. I'm great.

12:16.349 --> 12:19.410
But now that you mention it,
I could, uh...

12:19.686 --> 12:21.620
I could be better.

12:22.689 --> 12:23.884
How so?

12:24.891 --> 12:27.121
Well, for starters,
I could have my partner back.

12:30.196 --> 12:31.630
Well, unfortunately,

12:31.798 --> 12:35.666
she's on a rather important
assignment.

12:36.703 --> 12:37.864
Which is what again?

12:38.705 --> 12:40.730
It's classified.

12:42.408 --> 12:44.342
Can you at least tell me
if she's in danger?

12:44.510 --> 12:47.411
No more than usual.

12:49.883 --> 12:52.318
All right, I'm just gonna ask.
Is this because of me?

12:53.653 --> 12:56.281
You sending her away like that,
is that because of me?

12:56.456 --> 12:58.296
Because if it is, this is simple.
I can just...

12:58.458 --> 12:59.755
I can just walk.

12:59.926 --> 13:01.485
You know,
I'll just go back to L.A.P.D.

13:01.661 --> 13:03.356
because you don't have
to punish Kensi

13:03.529 --> 13:05.122
for something that I did

13:05.298 --> 13:07.198
or something that you think
that we did.

13:07.901 --> 13:11.735
So if there's a problem here,
I take full responsibility for that.

13:11.905 --> 13:15.569
That's very admirable of you,
Mr. Deeks.

13:16.242 --> 13:17.539
So is that it?

13:18.478 --> 13:21.209
I think I have everything I need.

13:27.220 --> 13:30.053
Any idea where Zevlos
might be headed?

13:30.223 --> 13:34.956
Uh, not yet, but we may have an idea
of how he'll get there.

13:35.128 --> 13:36.254
Hit me.

13:36.429 --> 13:39.990
Okay. This is a leasing agreement
from Million Air Charter.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.725
Yep. Million Air.

13:41.901 --> 13:44.165
It's a private charter company
out of Burbank.

13:44.337 --> 13:46.704
Company's owned by this guy,

13:46.873 --> 13:48.068
Michael Bell.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.642
Now, I looked into him.

13:50.810 --> 13:54.769
Turns out his real name
and the name he used in the KGB

13:54.948 --> 13:56.109
is Mikhail Brantov.

13:56.282 --> 13:57.408
Hello there, comrade.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.883
Guys, I found him.
I got a hit on Zevlos' Range Rover.

14:01.054 --> 14:03.079
Let me guess,
he's headed to the Burbank Airport?

14:03.256 --> 14:06.123
Uh, no, actually,
he's circling around Santa Monica.

14:06.592 --> 14:09.254
Maybe he's waiting
to pick up someone or something.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.261
Sending his location
to Callen and Sam now.

14:11.431 --> 14:13.559
Okay. I'm gonna head
to Million Air Charter

14:13.733 --> 14:15.758
in case he gets past them
and makes a break for it.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.425
- Good work.
- Thanks.

14:17.603 --> 14:19.093
He's traveling south on E Street.

14:19.272 --> 14:21.331
Should be coming around the corner
any moment.

14:31.651 --> 14:33.415
We got him, Eric.

15:02.715 --> 15:04.115
Federal agents! Get out of the car!

15:04.283 --> 15:06.342
Get out of the car!
Put your hands on the dashboard!

15:08.121 --> 15:09.714
- Where's Zevlos?
- Who?

15:09.889 --> 15:11.323
The guy whose car you just crashed.

15:11.491 --> 15:14.756
Some lady gave us the keys
and said it was her cheating husband's

15:14.927 --> 15:16.190
and told us to have fun.

15:16.362 --> 15:19.195
That's not stealing.
She gave it to us.

15:27.273 --> 15:29.367
FBI's been watching Maggie Vasile
since the raid

15:29.542 --> 15:30.702
so it couldn't have been her.

15:30.843 --> 15:33.608
- Which only leaves...
- Carla Shear.

15:33.780 --> 15:35.874
Zevlos' lawyer.

15:48.393 --> 15:49.485
It's confirmed?

15:54.299 --> 15:57.325
Witnesses at a food truck on Melrose
corroborated the kids' story.

15:57.502 --> 15:58.936
Any idea where Shear is?

15:59.103 --> 16:01.162
With Zevlos, for all we know.

16:02.540 --> 16:06.101
- Go for Deeks.
- The Range Rover was a distraction.

16:06.277 --> 16:08.075
Any chance you got eyes on Zevlos?

16:08.246 --> 16:10.908
Not unless
he's had facial reconstruction surgery.

16:11.082 --> 16:13.676
All I've seen so far
is an overzealous bridal party

16:13.852 --> 16:17.550
I'm assuming is going to Vegas
for the night and an old guy with a dog.

16:18.456 --> 16:19.821
Wait a minute.

16:25.864 --> 16:27.662
Stop the press.

16:32.604 --> 16:34.094
We have a new player.

16:36.274 --> 16:38.299
Go ahead and check your e-mails.

16:42.113 --> 16:43.274
Who the hell is this guy?

16:43.448 --> 16:45.416
His name is Donald Banks,
and get this.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.779
He's been with the CIA
almost three decades.

16:47.952 --> 16:50.182
CIA might be tracking Zevlos too.

16:50.355 --> 16:52.255
- Check him out anyways.
- You got it.

16:52.423 --> 16:54.790
Eric, contact Homeland Security
and the FAA.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.654
Have them shut down
Million Air Charter.

16:56.828 --> 16:58.694
Also, see if you can locate
Carla Shear.

16:58.863 --> 17:00.524
She's back at Zevlos' house.

17:00.698 --> 17:02.063
Showed up in a cab.

17:02.233 --> 17:04.634
And we've got some new intel
on her.

17:07.805 --> 17:10.740
- What do we know about her?
- Carla Shear, 36. Single.

17:10.909 --> 17:12.877
Admitted to the California Bar
in 2003.

17:13.044 --> 17:16.480
Specializes in high net worth
individuals, in personal matters.

17:16.647 --> 17:18.513
So a high school kid gets a DUI,

17:18.683 --> 17:20.481
his rich parents pay her
to make it go away.

17:20.652 --> 17:23.815
Exactly.
But looking at last year's tax return,

17:23.988 --> 17:26.012
we think she's being paid
under the table.

17:26.190 --> 17:29.455
Carla Shear reported earnings
of 115 K last year,

17:29.627 --> 17:31.322
but that wouldn't cover
half her mortgage

17:31.496 --> 17:32.691
on her Ocean Avenue condo,

17:32.864 --> 17:34.992
the new lease on her fancy F-Type

17:35.166 --> 17:37.328
- or her Louboutins.
- Her what?

17:37.502 --> 17:38.560
- Her shoes.
- Her shoes.

17:39.671 --> 17:40.900
What? My partner's a woman.

17:41.072 --> 17:44.235
Or at least she was.
I mean, she's still a woman.

17:44.409 --> 17:46.309
Actually, I'm not sure
if she's still a woman.

17:46.477 --> 17:48.437
Not that I know that
from any intimate experience.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.571
I'm just saying that, right now,

17:50.748 --> 17:54.116
- she's not here with me.
- We got it.

17:55.687 --> 17:58.782
Do any of Carla Shear's other clients
fit Zevlos' profile?

17:59.123 --> 18:01.182
What, war criminals on the run?

18:01.359 --> 18:04.090
He's her only client
with that particular legal problem.

18:04.262 --> 18:06.924
So then the question is, how much
did she really know about him?

18:07.098 --> 18:10.432
Was she taking orders
when she gave away his Range Rover,

18:10.602 --> 18:12.696
knowing that it would throw us
off his tail?

18:12.870 --> 18:15.567
Or was she in on the plan
from the get-go?

18:15.740 --> 18:18.072
Either way,
she's still our best bet to finding him.

18:18.242 --> 18:19.869
I think we need to ask her.

18:20.044 --> 18:21.876
- You go get the lawyer?
- Oniit.

18:22.046 --> 18:24.105
Find out everything
on Zevlos' business dealings.

18:24.282 --> 18:26.910
If he's gonna run, he's gonna
wanna liquidate as much as he can,

18:27.085 --> 18:29.281
- as fast as he can.
- Yep.

18:34.092 --> 18:35.685
Really?

19:08.926 --> 19:10.416
Do you mind?

19:12.130 --> 19:13.490
Wondering
what you were working on.

19:13.631 --> 19:15.099
It's classified, so...

19:15.266 --> 19:17.030
Well, I'm an NCIS agent, so...

19:17.502 --> 19:19.129
First I'm hearing about it.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.837
Let me guess. You must be Booker.

19:29.414 --> 19:30.939
Good talk.

19:37.855 --> 19:39.846
Please, take a seat.

19:44.362 --> 19:47.229
I want it on the record
that I came here willingly

19:47.398 --> 19:49.389
to cooperate with your investigation,

19:49.567 --> 19:52.502
and to help you find Mr. Vasile
and prove his innocence.

19:52.670 --> 19:53.694
You mean Zevlos.

19:53.871 --> 19:55.361
Ha, ha. You're cute.

19:55.540 --> 19:56.735
That's off the record.

19:56.908 --> 19:58.842
You should probably save that charm
for the jury.

20:00.144 --> 20:01.634
Grumpy much?

20:02.547 --> 20:05.227
- That's why you work alone?
- I don't work alone. I have a partner.

20:06.851 --> 20:08.046
He watching us?

20:08.219 --> 20:09.345
No, she's not.

20:10.755 --> 20:12.052
Where's she?

20:12.223 --> 20:16.217
- I don't know.
- So you are a lawyer.

20:16.394 --> 20:17.657
Yep.

20:17.829 --> 20:19.763
Who works for the L.A.P.D.
and NCIS?

20:19.931 --> 20:22.366
- You got it.
- Who has a missing partner?

20:22.967 --> 20:24.594
Bingo.

20:25.603 --> 20:27.537
She's good.

20:28.639 --> 20:29.663
She's very good.

20:35.446 --> 20:36.743
What do you have for me, Nell?

20:36.914 --> 20:39.508
Well, we found
some new information on Zevlos

20:39.684 --> 20:41.880
that you guys
might wanna take a look at.

20:42.053 --> 20:44.249
- Send it to my phone.
- Yep.

20:44.422 --> 20:46.083
What about Zevlos' Range Rover?

20:48.025 --> 20:49.925
You mean Vasile's Range Rover?

20:50.094 --> 20:52.062
You say Vasile, I say Zevlos.

20:52.230 --> 20:56.360
Tomato, tomato.
War criminal, criminal lawyer.

20:59.403 --> 21:01.064
I like you. I do.

21:01.239 --> 21:03.333
So I'm sorry
there's been so much confusion.

21:03.508 --> 21:05.508
- Let me try to straighten things out.
- Please do.

21:06.878 --> 21:09.677
Yes, I gave...

21:09.847 --> 21:11.440
We got something?

21:12.884 --> 21:14.374
Yeah.

21:14.886 --> 21:16.752
We got something.

21:17.588 --> 21:19.886
What a generous man he is,

21:20.057 --> 21:23.254
and his ongoing
charitable involvement.

21:23.427 --> 21:25.395
He's always pulling stunts like that.
It's crazy.

21:25.563 --> 21:28.589
- It's really crazy.
- Right.

21:28.766 --> 21:32.134
It's crazy like "sleeping with a client”
crazy.

21:40.611 --> 21:43.131
Zevlos didn't call you from
his regular cell phone this morning,

21:43.281 --> 21:46.512
because he has a separate line
just for you.

21:53.424 --> 21:55.085
Hope you had a warrant for that.

21:56.194 --> 21:57.684
Does his wife know?

22:00.731 --> 22:02.893
Wow, I didn't think so.

22:03.301 --> 22:06.134
So when did he let you in
on his real past in Romania?

22:07.805 --> 22:09.204
We're done here.

22:10.208 --> 22:11.471
I don't think we are.

22:14.645 --> 22:16.204
Please, sit.

22:16.781 --> 22:19.773
Not unless you're gonna charge me
with something, arrest me. Good luck.

22:19.951 --> 22:22.215
How about aiding and abetting
an international fugitive,

22:22.386 --> 22:24.150
filing fraudulent tax returns,

22:24.322 --> 22:27.053
interfering
with a federal investigation?

22:27.225 --> 22:28.283
Should I keep going?

22:28.459 --> 22:30.985
Your only real move here,
Carla, is to cooperate,

22:31.162 --> 22:34.598
because prison would do a number
on that fancy manicure.

22:41.172 --> 22:43.732
The guy you're helping
is a human trafficker.

22:43.908 --> 22:48.345
Young girls, children, babies,
all sold into slavery under his watch.

22:48.512 --> 22:50.207
No, that's a lie.

22:50.381 --> 22:54.215
I mean, he may have been
an arms dealer.

22:54.385 --> 22:56.945
He probably told you
he was an arms dealer.

22:57.321 --> 22:59.585
Thought it'd be easier to accept.

23:01.058 --> 23:03.686
But he made his money
in human flesh.

23:05.830 --> 23:06.854
Kids.

23:08.532 --> 23:10.193
Babies.

23:14.138 --> 23:15.731
Now,

23:16.774 --> 23:18.674
where the hell is he?

23:21.112 --> 23:23.137
He have money to run?

23:24.382 --> 23:27.010
He has 68 million invested
in real estate.

23:28.152 --> 23:32.111
He likes a certain lifestyle.
He's not walking away without it.

23:35.693 --> 23:37.627
Zevlos' legitimate finances

23:37.795 --> 23:41.163
are a web of shell corporations
and holding companies.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.528
He started buying up
commercial buildings

23:43.701 --> 23:46.227
in the mid-'90s
and has made a killing.

23:46.604 --> 23:48.436
Are you seeing many
sell-side transactions

23:48.606 --> 23:50.404
or was Zevlos
mainly buying property?

23:50.574 --> 23:53.100
- Looks like mostly acquisitions.
- So he's rich on paper

23:53.277 --> 23:55.974
but maybe too cash poor
to be an international fugitive.

23:56.147 --> 23:57.945
- Who financed his loans?
- Um...

23:58.916 --> 24:01.317
Wahr Geld Bank, Munich.

24:01.485 --> 24:04.147
He's gonna be looking
to liquidate assets and fast.

24:04.322 --> 24:07.724
Pull out as much money as he can,
even if it's pennies on a dollar.

24:08.526 --> 24:10.824
Doesn't help that he doesn't have
access to his lawyer.

24:11.362 --> 24:14.127
Well, he's either desperate enough
to do it on his own,

24:14.298 --> 24:16.323
or he's willing to forgo his fortune
and run.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.265
Let's hope he's as greedy
as he is deranged.

24:41.359 --> 24:42.485
You bored?

24:43.060 --> 24:44.528
Hey.

24:44.929 --> 24:46.158
I didn't know you were here.

24:46.897 --> 24:47.955
I'm not.

24:48.766 --> 24:50.166
Does that mean I'm not here either?

24:51.635 --> 24:52.693
What do you think?

24:53.971 --> 24:55.530
Okay.

24:56.073 --> 24:58.201
So maybe you can tell me
why I'm not here

24:58.376 --> 25:00.276
since no else seems to know.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.411
Come on.

25:18.629 --> 25:19.653
That isn't mine.

25:20.197 --> 25:21.358
Is now.

25:22.666 --> 25:23.724
What's the target?

25:24.535 --> 25:26.629
The locals call him Spin Pairay,

25:26.804 --> 25:30.434
the White Ghost. We don't know
who he is or where he's from,

25:30.608 --> 25:33.009
but we think he's a Westerner
who's working with the Taliban.

25:33.744 --> 25:36.076
- American?
- Maybe.

25:36.247 --> 25:38.978
It's possible he's a private contractor
that went native.

25:39.483 --> 25:42.111
Initially we thought
it was disinformation or tribal legend,

25:42.286 --> 25:43.766
but the insurgents
have been employing

25:43.921 --> 25:46.322
advanced combat tactics
that someone's been teaching them.

25:46.490 --> 25:49.118
- You want me to find him?
- No.

25:49.293 --> 25:51.523
The task force is gonna find him.

25:51.695 --> 25:52.719
You're gonna kill him.

25:56.901 --> 25:58.266
There's our guy.

25:59.003 --> 26:00.061
Only branch in town.

26:00.504 --> 26:01.562
Had to show up eventually.

26:10.681 --> 26:12.115
One o'clock.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.888
Get down! Everybody get down!

26:28.032 --> 26:29.932
Federal agents!
Everyone stay down!

26:34.705 --> 26:36.400
Grenade!

26:46.083 --> 26:47.141
You got him?

26:49.920 --> 26:51.979
I can't see anything.

26:59.897 --> 27:02.127
Go. Go. I got this.

27:32.795 --> 27:34.524
- Here.
- I'm fine.

27:38.635 --> 27:42.833
I understand Zevlos got away.

27:43.006 --> 27:44.303
We'll find him.

27:44.941 --> 27:46.705
I don't think so.

27:46.876 --> 27:49.436
SECNAV shut it down.

27:49.612 --> 27:50.807
What are you talking about?

27:50.980 --> 27:52.345
Why?

27:52.515 --> 27:57.214
All I know is that we are no longer
to pursue Mr. Zevlos.

27:57.387 --> 27:59.082
He shot three people.

27:59.255 --> 28:01.155
He practically blew up a bank.

28:01.324 --> 28:04.225
It's over, Mr. Hanna.

28:04.394 --> 28:06.226
Not for me.

28:06.396 --> 28:08.194
Not after what he did to those kids.

28:08.364 --> 28:12.028
I'm not going to repeat myself.

28:12.202 --> 28:16.332
Mr. Deeks, release Miss Shear.

28:17.807 --> 28:20.640
Good day, gentlemen.

28:28.585 --> 28:32.385
Zevlos still has ties
to the former Soviet bloc.

28:32.789 --> 28:34.655
He has friends in positions of power.

28:34.824 --> 28:38.419
He'd leverage those relationships
to put pressure on our government.

28:38.595 --> 28:40.996
Could've convinced them
to turn a blind eye.

28:41.497 --> 28:45.365
That and $68 million buys you
a lot of favors in this country.

28:45.535 --> 28:48.004
Only he doesn't have
the 68 million.

28:48.171 --> 28:50.765
Without the money,
there's nothing keeping him here.

28:51.241 --> 28:53.710
This time, Zevlos really is leaving.

28:55.878 --> 28:58.313
- What do you have, Eric?
- Okay, Donald Banks,

28:58.481 --> 29:01.416
the CIA agent who was
at Million Air Charter this morning,

29:01.584 --> 29:03.552
he wasn't always based in L.A.

29:03.720 --> 29:06.189
Uh, he was stationed
in a bunch of places,

29:06.356 --> 29:09.724
but he spent a good chunk
of the "80s in Romania.

29:09.892 --> 29:13.123
Maybe that's why the CIA
assigned him to find Zevlos.

29:13.296 --> 29:14.764
Could've been a personal vendetta.

29:14.931 --> 29:16.626
Or a personal relationship.

29:16.799 --> 29:18.528
How many flights
going out of Million Air?

29:18.701 --> 29:22.228
Just one, uh,
to Costa Rica leaving at 3:15.

29:22.405 --> 29:24.237
Two unlisted passengers.

29:25.141 --> 29:26.939
Zevlos and his CIA buddy?

29:27.110 --> 29:28.339
After what went down,

29:28.511 --> 29:30.946
Zevlos is not going anywhere
near an airport.

29:31.114 --> 29:32.707
He doesn't know who he can trust.

29:32.882 --> 29:35.579
Banks doesn't know that.
I mean, he's still waiting at the airport.

29:38.354 --> 29:41.881
I think it's time we lifted the lockdown
at Million Air Charter.

29:46.062 --> 29:47.928
Welcome to Million Air Charter,

29:48.097 --> 29:51.556
where our commitment
is to first-class service.

29:54.604 --> 29:56.971
Oh. Good afternoon.
May I help you?

29:57.140 --> 29:59.939
Yeah, I'm booked on a flight today,
315, to Costa Rica.

30:00.109 --> 30:02.100
- Okay. You are...?
- Victor Brown.

30:02.278 --> 30:05.942
Great. May I see your ID?
Thank you.

30:06.749 --> 30:08.911
I'm supposed to be meeting someone
here today.

30:09.085 --> 30:10.814
- And who might that be?
- Robert Taylor.

30:12.188 --> 30:13.212
Oh, yes, Mr. Taylor.

30:13.389 --> 30:15.357
He left a message
saying he is delayed

30:15.525 --> 30:17.045
and you should go on ahead
without him.

30:18.394 --> 30:20.522
- He did?
- Yes.

30:20.697 --> 30:24.395
He is booked on a flight
later this evening, also to Costa Rica.

30:24.567 --> 30:26.968
Wow, wish I was going
with you guys. Heh.

30:32.008 --> 30:36.844
- Looks like we have an empty seat.
- Oh, that's awfully generous.

30:37.013 --> 30:38.674
No, my treat.

30:38.848 --> 30:40.213
A little sand, sun and fun.

30:42.652 --> 30:45.849
Thank you. I wish I could,
but I am chained to this desk.

30:46.022 --> 30:47.854
Oh, come on. What's a few days?

30:48.024 --> 30:49.856
- I bet you deserve a vacation.
- I do.

30:50.026 --> 30:53.553
But my mom,
she is just so sick right now.

30:53.730 --> 30:54.959
Colitis.

30:55.131 --> 30:56.621
It's getting pretty messy.

30:58.701 --> 31:01.329
You know what though?
She could really use the trip.

31:01.504 --> 31:04.804
No, no, um, I understand.

31:04.974 --> 31:07.909
It's probably not good for her
to travel.

31:08.077 --> 31:09.636
You're probably right.

31:09.812 --> 31:11.507
Okay, you are all set.

31:11.681 --> 31:14.776
Your plane is first on the tarmac
to the right.

31:14.951 --> 31:17.249
- Have a great trip.
- All right, thank you.

31:26.896 --> 31:28.091
Banks is coming towards you.

31:28.264 --> 31:29.857
He's traveling under the name
Mr. Brown.

31:30.032 --> 31:32.057
He was waiting for a Mr. Taylor.

31:32.502 --> 31:35.528
Probably Zevlos traveling
under a new identity as well.

31:36.739 --> 31:38.332
Ah. Good afternoon, Mr. Brown.

31:38.508 --> 31:40.306
I can take your bag
and your jacket for you.

31:40.476 --> 31:42.308
Aah. Sure. I'll take a drink as well.

31:42.478 --> 31:43.707
Bourbon, neat.

31:45.114 --> 31:46.707
Why don't you go ahead
and buckle up?

31:46.883 --> 31:49.352
And I'll grab that bourbon for you.

32:08.738 --> 32:10.604
How about another one of these?

32:10.773 --> 32:13.037
Already in my hand, sir.

32:15.211 --> 32:17.543
- Sit down.
- What the hell is this?

32:17.713 --> 32:20.341
This is about to be
a tragic aviation accident,

32:20.516 --> 32:21.608
killing everyone onboard.

32:22.185 --> 32:25.883
Except they're only gonna recover
one body: Yours.

32:26.055 --> 32:29.218
Yeah. Autopilot's gonna disengage
in about two minutes

32:29.392 --> 32:30.512
and the plane's gonna crash.

32:30.660 --> 32:33.186
Feel free to use your seat
as a flotation device

32:33.362 --> 32:35.660
in the event of a water landing.

32:35.832 --> 32:37.231
This will be a water landing.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.458
Splash.

32:39.936 --> 32:43.497
I knew I couldn't trust that bastard.
That Romanian bastard.

32:43.673 --> 32:45.513
How much is he paying you guys?
I'll double it.

32:46.075 --> 32:47.167
With what?

32:47.343 --> 32:49.334
He's paying us out of your cut,
genius.

32:51.314 --> 32:52.804
- We good?
- We're good.

32:52.982 --> 32:54.916
- Good.
- Wait, wait!

32:55.084 --> 32:57.018
Look, Zevlos is in trouble.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.781
They're onto him, okay?
He may even be caught already.

33:00.957 --> 33:02.857
Look, I'm CIA. I can help.

33:03.025 --> 33:05.426
Why would Zevlos work
with the CIA?

33:05.595 --> 33:07.235
I'm the one who snuck him
into the States.

33:07.363 --> 33:10.298
I provided him with intel,
with names of operatives.

33:10.466 --> 33:12.906
Look, I can move just about anything
in or out of the country.

33:13.035 --> 33:14.366
Now, I can do the same for you.

33:14.537 --> 33:18.838
So let's just land this plane
and talk this through.

33:24.647 --> 33:26.513
Oh, thank God.

33:28.551 --> 33:29.712
You won't regret this.

33:29.886 --> 33:32.878
No, but you will.

33:33.523 --> 33:35.252
Okay, yeah, that was fantastic.

33:35.424 --> 33:37.064
Can one you please go back
to the cockpit?

33:37.460 --> 33:40.760
Ha, ha. Relax, Deeks.
I fly better than I drive.

33:40.930 --> 33:42.557
That's not saying a whole lot. I'll fly.

33:42.965 --> 33:44.399
I'm a better pilot than you are.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.228
- Since when?
- Since last summer.

33:46.402 --> 33:49.235
The Catalina Operation. There's no
way you could've landed that plane.

33:49.405 --> 33:50.605
Please, that was a float plane

33:50.773 --> 33:52.893
and it was pure luck
that we got shot down over water.

33:53.042 --> 33:54.407
Luck had nothing to do with it.

33:54.577 --> 33:56.238
I was in complete control
the entire time.

33:56.412 --> 33:58.403
- That proves nothing.
- That proves everything.

33:58.588 --> 34:00.388
Okay, listen,
I'll let you guys work that out.

34:00.550 --> 34:03.144
I'm just gonna go ahead
and leave my chute on.

34:04.420 --> 34:05.751
How's that bourbon?

34:20.168 --> 34:22.694
So according to the Wonder Twins,

34:22.870 --> 34:24.702
Donald Banks' financial history
shows

34:24.871 --> 34:27.773
that Zevlos has been giving him
generous kickbacks since '89.

34:27.942 --> 34:31.206
Buying the names of CIA operatives
abroad doesn't come cheap.

34:31.379 --> 34:35.043
Zevlos may have threatened to expose
CIA assets in Eastern Europe,

34:35.216 --> 34:39.312
which is why the State Department
told SECNAV to stand down.

34:39.954 --> 34:41.422
So, what do we do with him?

34:42.223 --> 34:43.884
We hand him over to the Agency.

34:44.058 --> 34:45.583
He's their problem.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.627
Hmph. They will be more than happy
to take care of this

34:48.795 --> 34:50.594
without mentioning our involvement.

34:50.764 --> 34:53.029
Spook-on-spook punishment?

34:53.201 --> 34:54.259
Spooky.

34:54.435 --> 34:56.301
And it keeps the Hetty-bot happy.

34:56.471 --> 34:58.701
Yeah, still doesn't get us any closer
to Zevlos.

34:58.873 --> 35:01.865
As soon as we were told to stand
down, he could've been out of here.

35:03.011 --> 35:04.775
Yeah, but he doesn't know that.

35:04.946 --> 35:07.381
If I'm Zevlos,
all I know is I'm a wanted man.

35:07.548 --> 35:08.982
I'm playing it safe.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.242
So, what does that mean?

35:10.418 --> 35:12.750
Means I'm laying low
until I'm guaranteed safe passage.

35:12.920 --> 35:16.550
Hmm. The kind of thing perhaps
you'd have your lawyer get for you.

35:16.724 --> 35:18.158
Or somebody that loves you.

35:19.093 --> 35:21.323
And if that's the same person...

35:25.099 --> 35:26.123
- Eric?
- Callen.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.631
Where's Carla Shear?

35:28.736 --> 35:31.569
Okay, I got her cell phone
moving south on Pacific Avenue

35:31.739 --> 35:33.173
between Navy and Rose.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.571
So where's she headed?
Santa Monica Airport? LAX?

35:35.743 --> 35:36.972
No, the marina.

35:37.145 --> 35:38.909
She cashed out her bank account
an hour ago.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.809
So I checked the bank's
phone records.

35:40.982 --> 35:42.342
It turns out someone placed a call

35:42.483 --> 35:45.680
to Carlyle Yacht and Boat Rentals
right after that.

35:45.853 --> 35:48.345
Carla chartered a boat,
slips 16 through 21.

35:48.523 --> 35:51.356
Alert Coast Guard, LA.P.D.,
and the harbormaster.

36:04.839 --> 36:06.671
You made it. I was getting worried.

36:08.943 --> 36:09.967
Good girl.

36:11.379 --> 36:12.904
What's wrong?

36:13.981 --> 36:16.221
They told me... They told me
you were a human trafficker.

36:16.350 --> 36:18.819
No. They would have told you
I eat children

36:18.986 --> 36:20.746
if they thought
it would turn you against me.

36:23.024 --> 36:26.392
Come. Let's go. We have to hurry.

36:37.171 --> 36:39.367
- Deeks, coming your way.
- I'm in position.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.133
Zevlos!

36:47.248 --> 36:48.909
Drop it!

36:49.684 --> 36:51.243
- John! John!
- Shut up.

36:51.419 --> 36:53.319
- What are you doing?
- Let her go.

36:53.488 --> 36:54.751
It's over.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.050
Back off or I'll kill her.

36:57.225 --> 36:58.522
- You know I will.
- John.

36:58.693 --> 37:00.525
Killing her won't help you get away.

37:01.095 --> 37:03.029
In fact, it'll ensure I kill you.

37:03.965 --> 37:06.696
Come on, Zevlos.
You're smarter than this.

37:07.135 --> 37:08.625
You're connected.

37:08.803 --> 37:11.238
Guy like you will be wired in prison
within a week.

37:12.306 --> 37:14.570
You'll probably have an escape plan
within a month.

37:14.742 --> 37:16.836
You don't want to call my bluff.

37:17.011 --> 37:18.069
She will die.

37:18.246 --> 37:20.840
John. John, please.

37:21.015 --> 37:22.244
Please.

37:24.352 --> 37:25.877
Take the shot.

37:26.954 --> 37:28.012
- Aah!
- Unh!

37:43.137 --> 37:45.606
Of course, that was only
if you went to jail here.

37:45.773 --> 37:49.073
I have no idea what's in store for you
at a Romanian war crimes tribunal.

37:49.777 --> 37:52.610
I'm so glad I didn't have to kill you.

37:53.414 --> 37:56.748
So you can spend the rest of your life
rotting in a cell.

38:00.254 --> 38:01.779
I'm sorry.

38:01.956 --> 38:03.476
I just wanted to see him
one last time.

38:03.624 --> 38:05.558
I was afraid
I would never see him again.

38:07.528 --> 38:08.927
You good?

38:09.897 --> 38:11.592
Yeah, I'm good.

38:13.034 --> 38:14.524
I'm good.

38:15.169 --> 38:16.728
Let's go.

38:22.476 --> 38:23.807
How is it?

38:23.978 --> 38:25.104
I feel like the new kid.

38:25.279 --> 38:26.838
No, I meant the rifle.

38:29.183 --> 38:31.811
Rifle's fine. It'll do the job.

38:33.387 --> 38:34.980
Do the others know
about my assignment?

38:35.156 --> 38:38.387
Unless they're complete idiots, they
should've gotten a pretty good idea

38:38.559 --> 38:40.857
once you started carrying
that cannon around.

38:41.028 --> 38:43.258
Well, I feel like they resent me
being here.

38:43.431 --> 38:46.162
Why would they?
And even if they do, so what?

38:46.334 --> 38:48.428
Well, some of us don't relish
being disliked.

38:53.307 --> 38:57.141
Let's focus on the mission,
Miss Congeniality.

39:10.358 --> 39:12.986
Mr. Callen? Mr. Hanna?

39:33.314 --> 39:34.338
Oh, come on.

39:34.515 --> 39:35.880
That's not fair.

39:36.050 --> 39:38.576
What's not fair, Mr. Hanna?

39:38.753 --> 39:40.243
Nothing.

39:44.925 --> 39:47.656
Well, I just got off the phone
with SECNAV.

39:47.828 --> 39:51.264
It seems the CIA has arrested
one of its own,

39:51.432 --> 39:56.165
- a man named Donald Banks.
- Hmm.

39:56.337 --> 39:58.829
No? Nothing?

39:59.006 --> 40:00.098
Never heard of him.

40:00.274 --> 40:04.677
Evidently,
he was tied in with Zevlos,

40:05.212 --> 40:09.012
who's also been taken into custody.

40:09.183 --> 40:10.673
Imagine that.

40:11.852 --> 40:13.911
- CIA is good.
- Mm-hm.

40:14.622 --> 40:18.684
"And ye shall know the truth

40:19.126 --> 40:24.030
and the truth shall make you free."

40:24.198 --> 40:25.688
That's their motto.

40:28.636 --> 40:30.365
That's a good motto.

40:32.106 --> 40:34.939
You disobeyed my orders.

40:39.914 --> 40:43.646
Hetty, there were extraordinary
circumstances.

40:43.818 --> 40:46.651
There always are.

40:46.821 --> 40:48.581
Would you have preferred
we let him get away?

40:48.723 --> 40:51.021
That's not the point.

40:51.192 --> 40:54.594
I give you both a lot of rope,

40:54.762 --> 40:57.993
and I would hate
to see you hang yourselves.

41:03.637 --> 41:06.163
Where's the third blind mouse?

41:08.576 --> 41:10.066
He had some paperwork
to catch up on.

41:10.244 --> 41:11.803
Another likely story.

41:12.279 --> 41:15.806
You know, I don't want
to see you in here tomorrow.

41:18.586 --> 41:20.987
- You're giving us tomorrow off?
- Yes.

41:21.722 --> 41:23.816
- Nice.
- Without pay, of course.

41:23.991 --> 41:26.585
No, suck it up.

41:26.861 --> 41:31.856
Unless you want to have
an extended unpaid vacation.

41:32.566 --> 41:35.194
- No, tomorrow's good.
- Heh.

41:37.738 --> 41:41.333
I don't play favorites, gentlemen.

41:41.509 --> 41:46.071
Even under extraordinary
