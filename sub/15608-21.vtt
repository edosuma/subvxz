(SHYLY) Zuri...
I really like you.

Wait, do you mean,
you like me?

02:19.750 --> 02:21.710

Wildlife Preserve.

Wow! Is it true
that they have the most

red-eyed peeper
frogs in the world?

02:59.170 --> 03:02.170
Yep! That place

03:03.040 --> 03:05.500
Nifty! Where do I sign up?

Whoa, Wildlife Preserves!

03:19.080 --> 03:21.290
Jam made of animals?

03:21.290 --> 03:23.290
I have got to try that!

03:27.460 --> 03:29.250
I just love this part.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.540
She's all alone in the rain,

03:31.540 --> 03:34.500
and then there he is,
with a pink umbrella...

03:34.500 --> 03:37.120
That belonged to his mother.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.960
Wow, Lou is
such a romantic sap.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.210
(EMOTIONALLY) Look,
the umbrella just broke,
like their love.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.420
Oy.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.880
So, what's your
favorite kind of music?

03:52.880 --> 03:53.960
Country.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.250
No way! Me too!
Why do you like it?

03:57.250 --> 03:59.620
Well, most of the songs
are about being in prison,

03:59.620 --> 04:01.380
so I can relate.

04:02.790 --> 04:06.120
Hey, there's this
country music festival

04:06.120 --> 04:08.380
all this week at Maren Harbor.

04:08.380 --> 04:12.170
If we can get a counselor
to take us, want to go?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.830
Is NASCAR a bunch of good
ol' boys turning left?

04:16.960 --> 04:19.170
Aww, look at Griff.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.080
LOU: He's a-courtin' Zuri!

04:21.080 --> 04:23.170
Don't be silly.
Yeah, they're just friends.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.250
(GASPS) Lou's right!
They're a-courtin'!

04:29.250 --> 04:31.290
Aw.
Look at those two.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.250
And those two.

04:33.250 --> 04:36.830
I can't take all this romance!
I need a tissue!

04:39.290 --> 04:42.960
You know... I wish Gladys
would just get a battery
to power the projector.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.210
There's tons of 'em
in the lake.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.920
You know, I'm not sure
it's such a good idea

04:47.920 --> 04:50.080
for Zuri and Griff
to be more than just friends.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.790
Yeah, I kind of agree.

04:51.790 --> 04:55.500
I mean, I like Zuri,
but I think she might
be a bad influence on Griff.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.290
She gets in trouble a lot.

04:57.290 --> 05:01.210
Excuse you? At least when Zuri
gets in trouble,
she gets grounded,

05:01.210 --> 05:03.250
not five years
making license plates!

05:03.250 --> 05:05.210
That was the old Griff!

05:05.210 --> 05:08.040
Oh, then it must have been
the new Griff who came up
with the idea to con the kids

05:08.040 --> 05:09.710
out of their candy
with that shell game.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.580
I doubt it. After all, it was
Zuri who got Jorge and Tiffany

05:12.580 --> 05:15.040
involved in candy smuggling
last year!

05:15.040 --> 05:18.210
You call it smuggling,
I call it being
a good business woman!

05:18.210 --> 05:20.670
I know we're mad
at each other, but don't we
want the same thing?

05:20.670 --> 05:21.790
Yeah.
Okay.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.380
Great! Why are we still mad?

05:23.380 --> 05:25.120
I don't know,
but I'm really out of breath!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.290
That Wildlife Preserve
was cool.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.000
There were so many frogs.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.500
By the way,
when you kiss them,

05:35.500 --> 05:37.540
they don't turn
into princesses.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.290
Nobody thought that.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.500
And Ravi,
we left three hours ago.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.420
Shouldn't we be back
at camp by now?

05:45.420 --> 05:48.380
We are taking the longer,
scenic route...

05:48.380 --> 05:50.710
To take in the scenery.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.290
We're lost.
Big time.

05:54.210 --> 05:55.500
Hey, look, a booth!

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
Maybe there's someone
in it that can help us.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.380
Hello?

06:02.380 --> 06:04.330
(GASPS) Oh,
cheese and crackers!

06:04.330 --> 06:06.290
I thought you were a bear.

06:06.290 --> 06:07.380
Do bears knock?

06:07.380 --> 06:09.500
Well, the polite ones do.
(LAUGHS)

06:11.250 --> 06:13.040
The name's Marie Poutine.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.790
Border Patrol Guard by day,

06:14.790 --> 06:17.210
professional funny lady
by night.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.170
Border patrol?
How far did we hike?

06:22.170 --> 06:24.120
Well, I don't know
where you started,

06:24.120 --> 06:25.670
but you're in Canada now.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.420
We're in Canada?

06:28.420 --> 06:30.960
And I understood
what she said.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.460
So, I speak English, Spanish,
and Canad-ese.

06:34.460 --> 06:38.380
Aww, looks like this guy took
a few too many pucks
to the head, eh?

06:39.920 --> 06:42.250
We are trying to get back
to Camp Kikiwaka.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.250
You're gonna have to talk to
the yahoo in the other booth.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.830
(YELLING) Hey, Cosmo!

06:47.710 --> 06:48.920
Marie!

06:49.670 --> 06:51.620
Stop screeching!

06:51.620 --> 06:54.040
Your voice is like
nails on my eyeballs!

06:54.040 --> 06:58.250
(SARCASTIC) Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I disrupt your
precious crossword puzzle?

06:58.250 --> 06:59.420
Oh! Here's a hint.

06:59.420 --> 07:03.210
Twelve across is
you're a nerd! (LAUGHS)

07:03.210 --> 07:06.500
And you're about as funny
as a beaver with a toothache.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.420
I'll have you know
The Maple Leaf Gazette

07:08.420 --> 07:10.580
called my stand-up comedy
"acceptable."

07:12.170 --> 07:15.620
Sorry to interrupt
your delightful banter,

07:15.620 --> 07:18.380
but could you give us
directions back to
Camp Kikiwaka?

07:18.380 --> 07:19.920
Oh, sure.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.290
You're gonna take
a left at that tree,

07:22.290 --> 07:24.170
a right at the pile
of moose poop

07:24.170 --> 07:26.000
and then straight on
down the dirt road.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.250
How do you know
the moose poop will be there?

07:28.250 --> 07:31.170
Oh, Marge?
She's a regular as a clock.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.250
Okay, thanks.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.210
And remember,
challenging your mind

07:35.210 --> 07:37.750
with a puzzle
does not make you a nerd.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.290
Yes, it does.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.290
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:43.290 --> 07:46.380
I can't let you back
into these United States

07:46.380 --> 07:48.670
without seeing
some proper identification.

07:48.670 --> 07:51.830
But we were just on a hike.
We do not have any ID on us.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.290
Then I guess you're
stuck in Canada,

07:54.290 --> 07:55.880
with her.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.330
What?
This is terrible.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.500
Well, at least
I know the language.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.500
Griff, we need to talk.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.750
What? I did a courtesy flush.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.880
It's not about that,
but thank you.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.460
It's about you and Zuri.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, man. I really like her.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.040
See, that's the problem.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.330
I'm not sure it's a good idea
for you two to hang out.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.250
What? Why?

08:25.250 --> 08:26.420
Because you've been doing
so well here,

08:26.420 --> 08:28.540
and Zuri's not exactly
a rule follower.

08:28.540 --> 08:30.420
I know. Isn't she great?

08:32.460 --> 08:34.210
Not for you.

08:34.210 --> 08:36.250
Who are you to tell me that?

08:36.250 --> 08:39.380
I'm the one who helped you
get into this camp,
so you're my responsibility.

08:39.380 --> 08:42.250
And I don't want you to
get in trouble
and wind up back in juvie.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.080
We're not gonna
get in trouble,

08:44.080 --> 08:45.830
and this is
none of your business!

08:45.830 --> 08:48.880
Griff, as your friend,
it's my job to make sure

08:48.880 --> 08:50.540
you don't go down
the wrong path.

08:50.540 --> 08:56.000
Yet last week you took us
on a hike, and we ended up
in a bears' den!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.960
And then I bravely played dead
to make the bear go away.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.830
Oh, please, you fainted.

09:03.290 --> 09:04.380
Still counts!

09:06.620 --> 09:09.380
What do you mean
you don't want me
hanging out with Griff?

09:09.380 --> 09:11.380
Zuri, I'm really sorry,

09:11.380 --> 09:13.710
but it's my job
as your big sister
to look out for you.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.750
This isn't fair!

09:15.750 --> 09:20.170
If life were fair,
Chris Hemsworth would be
our cook instead of Murphy.

09:20.170 --> 09:23.460
Look, I can't have your
first relationship
be with an ex-felon.

09:23.460 --> 09:27.080
Just because Griff went
to juvie doesn't mean
I'll end up there.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.420
Well, I can't take
that chance.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.080
And I'm not willing
to call Mom and Dad

09:30.080 --> 09:32.080
and tell them
their little girl was nabbed
by the coppers

09:32.080 --> 09:33.380
and is doin'
a stint in the pokey!

09:35.250 --> 09:39.250
You have got to stop
watching those old movies.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.540
Look, Zuri, you've gotten
in a lot of trouble at camp.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.330
I have not! Name one time.

09:45.330 --> 09:48.920
Just last week, you tried
to sell this whole place
to Chinese investors!

09:48.920 --> 09:51.790
They offered me
twenty percent over asking!

09:51.790 --> 09:55.120
It's not your camp to sell!

09:55.120 --> 09:58.170
Zuri, I'm your big sister,
and I don't want to
see you get in trouble,

09:58.170 --> 10:01.250
so I need you to
stop seeing Griff.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.330
And what if I don't?

10:03.330 --> 10:06.250
Then I'll make you go
to every one of

10:06.250 --> 10:08.830
Tiffany's recitals for the
rest of the summer.

10:08.830 --> 10:10.290
Well, that's just mean.

10:16.290 --> 10:19.120
I know we did the right thing
for Griff and Zuri.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.620
(SIGHS) Yeah, although
she wasn't very happy.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.500
Which was clear from the note
attached to that snake
she left in my bed.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.210
Psst! Zuri!

10:31.210 --> 10:34.120
Griff!
I really miss you!

10:34.120 --> 10:35.830
Scamming campers
out of their stuff

10:35.830 --> 10:39.000
seems so meaningless
without you.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.710
And I've really missed you
when I was selling
Xander's filling.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.920
I can't believe
they're trying to keep us
from seeing each other.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.880
I know. This is just like
what happened
to Romeo and Juliet.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.540
What cabin are they in?

10:53.540 --> 10:57.250
They're characters,
in the play by Shakespeare.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.080
Still nothing, huh?

11:02.250 --> 11:05.620
I'm mad at Xander!
They're being such jerks!

11:05.620 --> 11:07.330
And the jerks just heard that!

11:07.330 --> 11:09.210
You guys are in big trouble.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.210
So we're talking.
What are you gonna
do about it?

11:15.710 --> 11:17.500
I did not see that coming.

11:18.330 --> 11:20.170
(GASPS) Ow!

11:20.170 --> 11:23.580
I hope your finger swells
so much that your diamond
rings don't fit anymore!

11:23.580 --> 11:26.120
(GASPS) You take that
back right now!

11:27.290 --> 11:28.620
Howdy doody!

11:30.880 --> 11:32.460
Is a twister coming?

11:33.670 --> 11:36.250
No. But I need to go
to the infirmary.

11:36.250 --> 11:39.170
There's a nail
in my fingernail.
Watch Zuri!

11:39.170 --> 11:40.620
Okey-McDokey.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.920
Why am I doing this?

11:49.290 --> 11:51.420
To keep me
from talking to Griff.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.290
Emma and Xander have forbidden
us to see each other.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.920
You're kidding.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.750
This reminds me
of the time back home,
when my friends

11:57.750 --> 12:00.330
Johnnie and Susie
were forbidden to be together.

12:00.330 --> 12:01.960
Why were they forbidden?

12:01.960 --> 12:03.880
Well, Johnnie was a meat goat,

12:03.880 --> 12:08.000
while Susie was a milk goat.
So, you see the problem.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.380
This just stinks.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.620
Griff asked me to go to the
country music festival

12:13.620 --> 12:16.170
in Maren Harbor,
and I really want to go.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.880
Who wouldn't? Country music
and deep fried everything.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.170
But I can't go against
Emma and Xander.

12:22.170 --> 12:25.250
(SIGHS)
Is there anything else
I can do?

12:25.250 --> 12:28.670
Well, you could go tell Griff
that I miss him.

12:28.670 --> 12:30.080
Got it.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.710
And that he's the coolest guy
I've ever met.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.080
Got it.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.880
And no matter how hard they
try to keep us apart,

12:36.880 --> 12:39.790
our burning spark of love
will never be quenched...

12:39.790 --> 12:41.170
I better write this down.

12:49.210 --> 12:52.210
Griff! I have
a message for you.

12:53.580 --> 12:56.670
Is it that your legs
fell asleep?

12:56.670 --> 13:01.080
No. I'm crawling
and whispering so Xander
won't hear me!

13:01.080 --> 13:02.540
(WHISPERING) He's not here!

13:02.540 --> 13:05.380
Oh, great! So I got rug burn
on my knees for no reason?

13:07.330 --> 13:09.080
So, what's the message?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.960
Oh, well, Zuri says
she misses you.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.250
(LAUGHS)

13:13.250 --> 13:15.750
And you're the coolest guy
she's ever met,

13:15.750 --> 13:16.750
and...

13:18.710 --> 13:20.960
Something about a churning
bark of glove...

13:22.380 --> 13:23.540
And Judi Dench?

13:24.420 --> 13:26.080
What?

13:26.080 --> 13:29.000
I got surprisingly sweaty
on the way over here.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.380
Look, I hate to
play this card,

13:34.380 --> 13:35.620
but if it will help,

13:35.620 --> 13:37.380
my parents are loaded,

13:37.380 --> 13:39.380
like a baked potato.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.670
And I can get you
some of that cheddar. Wink.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.380
Are you trying to bribe me?

13:45.380 --> 13:47.120
With a baked potato?

13:48.670 --> 13:50.620
You're looking at some
serious jail time, mister!

13:50.620 --> 13:53.250
Oh, no, I cannot go to jail!

13:53.250 --> 13:55.500
I barely survived
private school!

13:56.920 --> 13:58.790
(FROG CROAKING)

13:58.790 --> 14:01.380
Huh, Jorge, I thought
I'd heard all your noises.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.790
That wasn't me.
It was Edward Hoppy,

14:03.790 --> 14:06.420
my frog friend
I just found in the woods.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.330
Wait a moon pie!

14:08.330 --> 14:10.290
This is a red-eyed peeper.

14:10.290 --> 14:13.210
They're a protected species
here in Canada.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.540
Were you trying to smuggle
him outta the country?

14:15.540 --> 14:19.830
No, I was just gonna
take him home with me.

14:19.830 --> 14:23.210
You, sir,
are in big trouble
with the Canadian government.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.290
Not so fast.

14:25.290 --> 14:29.170
They're already
in big trouble with these
United States of America.

14:29.170 --> 14:33.250
A country with real sports,
not "ice sweeping."

14:33.250 --> 14:35.420
(GASPS) How dare you!

14:35.420 --> 14:38.000
Curling is a frozen
water ballet!

14:38.000 --> 14:41.460
It's people in puffy jackets
doing housework!

14:42.120 --> 14:43.580
C'mon, kids.

14:44.290 --> 14:46.210
Don't you move an inch!

14:46.210 --> 14:47.880
You are not
taking those kids...

14:47.880 --> 14:50.540
We just created
an international incident.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.330
RAVI: What? No!

14:52.330 --> 14:55.920
Up until now
my list of crimes was limited
to ignoring curfew!

14:55.920 --> 14:58.210
Wow, you actually
stayed out too late?

14:58.210 --> 15:00.290
No, I came home too early.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.460
Zuri. I have a message
for you from Griff!

15:12.960 --> 15:17.210
I mean, I have...
A massage as a gift...

15:17.210 --> 15:19.380
For you. I'll go get my oils.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.750
Wait!

15:21.750 --> 15:24.000
If you're looking for Zuri,
she's in the mess hall.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.210
And I can't believe
my best friend would come
between me and my sister!

15:27.210 --> 15:28.830
I'm sorry.

15:28.830 --> 15:32.080
But honestly, I think
you and Xander
are overreacting.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.330
Well, I don't,

15:34.330 --> 15:36.750
and Zuri is my sister,
so I need you
to respect my wishes.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.580
Fine.

15:38.580 --> 15:42.830
For you, I will no longer
water the seedlings of their
beautiful young love.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.420
Thank you.
And I'll take you up
on that massage.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.580
This situation has gotten me
super tense.

15:51.210 --> 15:55.080
Maybe we should
make a run for it.
Who wants to carry me?

15:56.290 --> 15:58.250
Nobody!

15:58.250 --> 16:00.580
And Ravi,
tell Jorge he's crazy.

16:01.620 --> 16:02.710
Run!

16:03.500 --> 16:05.120
(SIREN WAILING)

16:08.580 --> 16:10.330
Zuri, I'm sorry,

16:10.330 --> 16:12.380
but I promised Emma
that I would stop being

16:12.380 --> 16:13.960
the go-between
for you and...

16:14.290 --> 16:15.290
Griff?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.170
Griff's here?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.000
What?

16:21.040 --> 16:23.420
Look, guys, I know it's tough
that you can't be together,

16:23.420 --> 16:26.000
but I'm going to tell you
the same thing
I told my goats,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.380
Johnnie and Susie...

16:27.380 --> 16:28.380
Baaaahh!

16:30.380 --> 16:32.080
I hope that helps.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.750
Look, Emma and Xander
are down at the lake
teaching swimming.

16:37.750 --> 16:42.330
So we just thought we could
sneak a couple minutes
together to talk.

16:42.330 --> 16:43.920
I guess that can't hurt.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.420
But why are you packing?

16:45.420 --> 16:48.460
I, uh, like to pack
when I'm sad.

16:48.460 --> 16:51.080
We all have our quirks.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.960
C'mon guys, I know
you're planning something.
I'm not stupid.

16:57.330 --> 17:00.290
(CHUCKLES) But you are
handcuffed to the furniture.

17:00.290 --> 17:02.290
I knew these would come
in handy someday.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.250
Wait! You take these
off right now!

17:06.250 --> 17:08.960
Okay, we'll go get the key!

17:08.960 --> 17:10.290
Thank you.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.710
They're not going to
get the key.

17:20.210 --> 17:23.330
Guys, we have a
huge problem!

17:23.330 --> 17:25.170
Lou, why are you handcuffed
to a footboard?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.830
Because I don't feel like
gnawing off my hand!

17:28.880 --> 17:30.500
Zuri and Griff
have run off!

17:30.500 --> 17:32.750
What? How could you
let this happen?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.290
I didn't let it happen!

17:34.290 --> 17:36.670
Do you think
this is a fashion choice?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.670
I knew it!
This is Griff's fault!

17:39.670 --> 17:41.500
He's corrupted
my sweet little sister.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.210
No, it's Zuri's fault!

17:43.210 --> 17:45.250
She's the one who corrupted
my little Grizzly!

17:45.250 --> 17:48.830
Wait! Zuri mentioned something
about a country music festival

17:48.830 --> 17:51.040
in Maren Harbor.
Maybe they went there.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.170
That's crazy!

17:52.170 --> 17:53.170
They know they're
not supposed to leave camp

17:53.170 --> 17:54.960
without a counselor.
It's dangerous!

17:54.960 --> 17:56.540
And Maren Harbor
is so far away!

17:56.540 --> 17:58.000
How do they
expect to get there?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.580
They must have gone to
town to get the bus.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.080
How can we stop them?
I know a shortcut! Let's go!

18:09.040 --> 18:12.080
Now I know what a bathroom key
at the gas station feels like.

18:13.830 --> 18:15.670
Bribery.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.040
Attempted escape.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
Don't forget frog smuggling!

18:20.710 --> 18:24.210
(CRYING) I cannot believe
I will have a criminal record

18:24.210 --> 18:26.290
on my permanent record.

18:26.290 --> 18:29.210
Now I will never
get into Yale!

18:29.210 --> 18:31.330
I guess I could
settle for Harvard.

18:31.330 --> 18:32.830
They will accept anyone.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.580
And littering.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.080
(SOBS)

18:38.880 --> 18:40.500
Holy Zamboni!

18:40.500 --> 18:44.500
If you cried this much
during winter,
you'd be a solid block of ice.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.330
Can't you please,
please just forget all this
and let us go?

18:48.330 --> 18:50.210
That would be easy for Marie.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.250
She forgets everything.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.330
Here we go again!

18:54.330 --> 18:57.880
So I forgot the anniversary
of our first date. Big whup!

18:57.880 --> 19:01.170
Hey, I think I have an idea
that might get us out of here.

19:02.250 --> 19:05.210
So, Cosmo, Marie...

19:05.210 --> 19:08.170
Where exactly do you think
your relationship went wrong?

19:08.170 --> 19:09.670
I'll tell you
where it went wrong.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.290
He had so many
anniversaries for us,

19:11.290 --> 19:13.120
I could barely
keep track of them all!

19:13.120 --> 19:15.710
First hug, first canoe ride,

19:15.710 --> 19:19.500
first elk scones
we made together...

19:19.500 --> 19:23.670
So your relationship
ended all because of
one forgotten date?

19:23.670 --> 19:25.460
What a shame.

19:25.460 --> 19:30.290
Indeed, but I think I know
how we can work past this
anniversary kerfuffle.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.920
(GIGGLES)
Kerfuffle.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.790
Ravi, you can't just
make up words.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.920
Anyway.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.000
What if Cosmo just chooses
one anniversary to celebrate?

19:42.000 --> 19:45.080
That way, it will be easier
for Marie to remember.

19:45.080 --> 19:48.170
How about November 11th?

19:48.170 --> 19:49.960
(SMILES) The day we first met.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.920
You remember?
Of course I do.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.380
You dug me
out of a snow drift.

19:54.380 --> 19:58.170
I still have the toe you
helped me chop off
on account of my frostbite.

19:58.170 --> 19:59.250
Awww...

19:59.250 --> 20:00.540
ALL: Ewwww...

20:03.250 --> 20:05.170
Thanks so much, Tiffany.
How can we ever repay you?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.830
Well... You could let us go.

20:07.830 --> 20:11.290
Uh, I don't know...

20:11.290 --> 20:15.170
You know, Cos Cos,
that would mean we could
have a little alone time.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.540
Hmm?

20:16.540 --> 20:18.120
See ya, kids!

20:24.880 --> 20:28.330
Xander, when was the last time
you took this "short cut"?

20:28.330 --> 20:32.880
Three years ago.
When there weren't any
thorn bushes or quicksand.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.500
Oh, don't forget
the shooting range,
that was fun.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.880
(GASPS) It's after six.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.830
The last bus just left
for Maren Harbor.

20:40.830 --> 20:42.040
Looks like we're too late.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.960
I guess we should
head back to camp.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
there's no way we're taking
your shortcut again.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.000
I know a better way.

20:53.790 --> 20:56.290
So, Lou, about that shortcut.

20:56.290 --> 20:59.170
Did you say
"better" or "wetter"?

20:59.170 --> 21:02.710
In my defense,
that old bridge was a lot more
rickety than I remembered.

21:04.210 --> 21:07.080
Zuri?
XANDER: Griff!

21:07.080 --> 21:09.250
(SIGHS) You guys
have been here the whole time?

21:09.250 --> 21:11.000
Where did you think we'd be?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.960
Honestly, we thought
you'd run off to that
music festival by yourselves.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.500
Well, we wanted to,
but I didn't want to
get Griff in trouble.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.290
And I didn't want Zuri
to get in trouble.

21:20.290 --> 21:23.380
So, instead we just went
for a picnic by the lake.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.580
Hmm.

21:25.580 --> 21:29.080
Looks like they're not
such a bad influence
on each other after all.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.210
Maybe we did
overreact a little.

21:32.210 --> 21:33.540
A little?

21:33.540 --> 21:35.500
You boarded up our windows!

21:37.120 --> 21:38.250
We're sorry, guys.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.330
We really should have
trusted you.

21:40.330 --> 21:43.620
So... Does that mean it's okay
for Zuri and me to hang out?

21:44.710 --> 21:46.290
I guess so.

21:46.290 --> 21:48.580
In fact, maybe you guys
could even go to that
festival tomorrow.

21:48.580 --> 21:51.420
I mean, if you could
find a counselor
who loves country music.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.830
Ooh, me, me!

21:52.830 --> 21:55.790
Ooof! Forgot that was there.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.670
Sorry about
handcuffing you, Lou.
Do you want the key?

21:58.670 --> 22:01.000
Actually, I'm getting kind of
used to it.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.380
It's like a big ol'
charm bracelet.

22:03.380 --> 22:05.330
Hey, you know what would
look great on here?

22:05.330 --> 22:06.620
A croquet mallet!

22:12.290 --> 22:15.250
Maybe we should go back
and wait at the bus.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.380
Yeah, the driver said
a mechanic would be there
soon to fix it.

22:18.380 --> 22:23.120
No way. I promised to get you
to that music festival
and I know a great shortcut.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.670
They really have to fix some
of the bridges around here.

22:32.420 --> 22:35.290
Excuse me, which way
is Maren Harbor?

22:35.290 --> 22:37.120
Sweet maple syrup,

22:37.120 --> 22:40.210
you guys are lost big time.
This is Canada.

22:40.210 --> 22:43.750
Oh... Well, then I guess
we'll just head back
to the good 'ol U. S. of A.

22:46.380 --> 22:49.880
Hey, Cosmo, you have visitors.

22:49.880 --> 22:53.000
Thanks, Poutie.
You have some ID?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.290
No.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.000
Is that a problem?
