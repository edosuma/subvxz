00:30.454 --> 00:33.652
Familiarity need
not breed contempt.

00:34.060 --> 00:37.071
A new adventure or a special dress

00:37.072 --> 00:41.506
can render the mundane bright,
and the accustomed novel.

00:44.047 --> 00:48.983
Sometimes, we simply see
each other through fresh eyes.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.000
And there's joy in it.

00:55.571 --> 00:59.587
I cannot comprehend how you can
fail to build on your experience.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.480
You've been here
for over six months.

01:02.731 --> 01:06.491
You should have delivered
numberless babies in that time

01:06.516 --> 01:08.179
without any supervision.

01:08.204 --> 01:10.980
Well, I think Nurse Crane just
wanted me to be sure of everything.

01:11.257 --> 01:14.941
One can never be sure
of everything in childbirth,

01:15.170 --> 01:17.798
it doesn't matter whether
you're in Poplar or Peking.

01:18.048 --> 01:21.819
There may be only so many ways
a baby can emerge into the world,

01:22.053 --> 01:25.411
but they have a
peerless ability to surprise us.

01:25.672 --> 01:27.272
Nurse Crane says
that I'm not really...

01:27.297 --> 01:30.312
Until Nurse Crane says
she's coming home from hospital,

01:30.337 --> 01:33.773
I think you'll find
that I'm in charge of the rota.

01:33.798 --> 01:37.559
From tomorrow morning,
your name will be on the call board.

01:38.230 --> 01:40.589
I'm going to put it there myself.

01:43.690 --> 01:46.981
Goodness me, we weren't expecting
a mannequin parade.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.876
Well, we thought
we ought to make an effort.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.684
Mrs Turner's been planning
her canapés for weeks.

01:51.783 --> 01:53.337
She's doing hard-boiled eggs

01:53.362 --> 01:57.330
stuffed with kipper mousse
and cheese, and pineapple on sticks.

01:57.355 --> 01:59.031
That all sounds very modern.

01:59.032 --> 02:02.051
The Brook Advisory Centre's
very modern,

02:02.052 --> 02:05.710
and if a range of canapés helps
to rally support for a branch

02:05.735 --> 02:09.151
in our borough, I happen to think
that's all to the good.

02:09.734 --> 02:11.790
Well, I hope you all
have a very pleasant evening,

02:12.217 --> 02:14.768
and that you'll listen
to other points of view.

02:15.334 --> 02:16.718
But of course, Sister.

02:21.251 --> 02:24.060
I see someone's up
after their bedtime.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.015
They insisted on saying
hello before bed.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.220
But I think they just wanted
a chance to be nosy.

02:29.668 --> 02:31.096
Hello, young lady.

02:31.147 --> 02:35.137
Have you gotten even bigger
since I saw you last?

02:35.162 --> 02:37.871
In fact, you're all
positively gigantic!

02:38.032 --> 02:40.599
I suggest you
stop feeding them immediately.

02:40.624 --> 02:42.039
You might be right.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.242
You can have a handful of
peanuts each

02:44.267 --> 02:46.325
and then it's up the wooden hill
to Bedfordshire.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.415
Violet, I am so pleased
that you could come.

02:49.925 --> 02:52.661
I think I'd better be
Councillor Buckle this evening,

02:52.686 --> 02:53.833
all things considered.

02:53.858 --> 02:55.024
Of course.

02:55.155 --> 02:56.849
Can I tempt you to a glass of wine?

02:56.874 --> 02:59.019
Oh, just a small dry sherry,
thank you,

02:59.020 --> 03:01.036
as I'm on official business.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.450
- Please.
- Thank you.

03:03.909 --> 03:08.941
We believe that a Brook Advisory
Centre would be a boon to Poplar.

03:09.392 --> 03:13.070
The central London branch already
gives access to contraception

03:13.320 --> 03:16.330
and confidential advice
to anyone who requires it,

03:16.616 --> 03:20.245
including, very importantly,
unmarried women.

03:20.557 --> 03:24.999
But the reality is that single women
are most in need of those services.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.047
They're the ones whose lives
are turned upside down

03:27.048 --> 03:29.067
by unwanted pregnancies.

03:29.068 --> 03:31.743
And unfortunately,
those women often take

03:31.768 --> 03:34.663
desperate measures when they find
themselves in that predicament.

03:35.805 --> 03:37.793
How much would all this cost?

03:38.697 --> 03:41.701
The Brook Foundation
would fund it at the outset.

03:41.950 --> 03:45.249
But we would need the council
to provide the running costs.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.375
It will be money well spent
for the women of Poplar.

03:50.850 --> 03:53.380
The problem is,
we don't just look after women,

03:53.405 --> 03:55.007
we have to think about everyone -

03:55.008 --> 03:58.084
men, women, children, handicapped.

03:58.383 --> 04:03.080
If we give you money, then we have
to take it away from someone else,

04:03.355 --> 04:04.824
and that can't be right.

04:05.376 --> 04:07.179
Can it, Mother Mildred?

04:07.898 --> 04:09.942
I have yet to form an opinion.

04:10.195 --> 04:16.103
I came here tonight to listen,
mark, learn and inwardly digest.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.509
I mean information and not canapés.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.173
And so these
swimmers steady for the start

04:23.198 --> 04:25.011
of this 100 metres freestyle.

04:25.012 --> 04:28.028
And they're away beautifully.

04:29.088 --> 04:32.015
An excellent start there
from McGregor,

04:32.016 --> 04:33.786
the "Falkirk Flyer" as he's known...

04:34.114 --> 04:36.897
The harvest cross was the
first corn dolly I learned to make.

04:37.272 --> 04:40.410
I've made one every
harvest festival since.

04:40.858 --> 04:42.420
Certainly very intricate.

04:42.587 --> 04:45.736
Well, they're supposed
to be potent fertility symbols.

04:46.481 --> 04:49.235
Then perhaps we should
prepare for busy times.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.891
Oh!

04:50.947 --> 04:55.224
Swim, plough the waters,
like Poseidon's hippocampi!

04:55.582 --> 04:58.003
Gold shall be your reword!

04:58.004 --> 05:00.043
The finals of the
men's 100 metre swim.

05:00.044 --> 05:03.881
This young man carries
Olympic hopes for our nation.

05:04.098 --> 05:07.844
So far, gold has evaded
our British team.

05:08.197 --> 05:11.075
But as he heads there,

05:11.076 --> 05:14.474
it's gold for Schollander, quite
easily, silver for Bob McGregor...

05:14.499 --> 05:17.316
And evades us yet again.

05:18.028 --> 05:21.009
He got the silver.
It's still a medal.

05:22.127 --> 05:23.215
It'll have to suffice.

05:30.522 --> 05:33.444
If I were a betting woman,
I'd put a shilling on

05:33.469 --> 05:36.738
your having your first solo
delivery before the week is out.

05:37.024 --> 05:38.480
You sound very convinced.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.815
I said a shilling,
not a half crown!

05:41.461 --> 05:43.839
Babies come along when
they feel inclined.

05:43.864 --> 05:46.667
We can only prepare,
we can never predict.

05:54.024 --> 05:56.007
Thank you very much, Mrs Jones.

05:56.008 --> 05:58.008
Hello, would you like
to come with me?

06:06.378 --> 06:07.659
Are those for Nurse Crane?

06:07.972 --> 06:09.059
Yes.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.548
Would you mind passing this on
to her as well?

06:12.532 --> 06:15.593
It would seem that Nurse Crane
has quite the fan club.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.462
I'll deliver them this evening.

06:17.843 --> 06:19.145
I'm sure she'll appreciate that.

06:24.336 --> 06:25.656
That came from your boots.

06:25.681 --> 06:28.363
You sound like you've got the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.828
That's what it feels like.

06:30.892 --> 06:32.317
Is this about last night?

06:33.810 --> 06:36.794
I stood for the council
because I considered myself

06:36.819 --> 06:38.903
to be one of life's problem-solvers.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.840
I'd agree with that.

06:41.805 --> 06:43.845
I knew I'd be taking
responsibility for potholes

06:44.380 --> 06:48.083
and Dicky street lights, but not
the moral well-being

06:48.108 --> 06:50.032
of the young women of Poplar.

06:51.252 --> 06:55.414
They were right, Dr Turner and
Trixie, they could do a lot of good.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.160
- I just wish that...
- They could do it a bit cheaper.

07:00.232 --> 07:01.543
Exactly.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.008
- Mrs Pugh?
- Mrs Blakemore?

07:24.813 --> 07:25.833
All right.

07:25.858 --> 07:26.878
Oh.

07:27.108 --> 07:28.854
Thank you. Sorry.

07:29.394 --> 07:31.841
When's this little beggar going to
put in an appearance, then?

07:31.866 --> 07:33.271
Not long, Mrs Blakemore.

07:33.296 --> 07:36.263
That's... That's music to my ears.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.914
I've had everything ready at home
for, well, for weeks.

07:40.030 --> 07:42.094
And you seem very calm about it.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.435
I worried myself silly
over the first one,

07:44.460 --> 07:45.826
my sisters didn't help.

07:45.851 --> 07:48.220
Full of horror stories
they were about their babies,

07:48.254 --> 07:51.186
- but come my big day...
- Oh, as simple as that.

07:51.485 --> 07:54.497
Well, Eric said I made
a right racket last time.

07:54.522 --> 07:56.294
Could hear me down
the docks, apparently!

07:57.631 --> 07:58.943
Just come around this way.

08:02.655 --> 08:04.511
The first few months were a trial.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.063
If it hadn't been for my neighbour,
Connie...

08:08.375 --> 08:11.007
I didn't know a soul
when I moved here with my Vince.

08:11.008 --> 08:12.363
It must've been pretty lonely.

08:15.052 --> 08:17.413
I'm so relieved to have
my get-up-and-go back,

08:17.708 --> 08:19.581
cos things were
getting a bit desperate.

08:20.024 --> 08:22.051
And my Vince is not
at all domesticated,

08:22.052 --> 08:24.588
and with him spending all his
time down the dog track...

08:25.791 --> 08:27.670
Oh, he's a bookie.
He's not a gambler.

08:29.157 --> 08:30.746
He just takes their money.

08:31.016 --> 08:32.908
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're feeling better.

08:35.466 --> 08:37.306
Was there something else, Mrs Pugh?

08:38.395 --> 08:39.863
It's my waterworks.

08:41.568 --> 08:44.648
When I go for a wee,
and I've been needing to go a lot...

08:45.935 --> 08:48.537
Anyway, it burns,
and this morning I noticed

08:48.562 --> 08:52.901
a smell, like, down there.
And not a nice one.

08:53.162 --> 08:54.621
It's probably nothing
to worry about,

08:54.646 --> 08:55.935
but let's make absolutely sure.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.601
We'll start with
a urine sample, shall we?

09:02.024 --> 09:04.330
This is a serious matter.

09:04.393 --> 09:07.043
The pride of the nation is at stake.

09:07.044 --> 09:08.216
Is it?

09:08.767 --> 09:10.795
The future will be upon us,

09:11.056 --> 09:13.644
measured in increments
of four years.

09:17.048 --> 09:21.087
His proportions were far from ideal
for track and field anyway.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.413
Athletes must be ectomorphs.

09:25.043 --> 09:29.202
Slender, and bred for speed,
like a whippet.

09:29.227 --> 09:31.727
Elizabeth, these children
are not dogs.

09:31.844 --> 09:34.394
Perhaps a little young
to be considering the Olympics.

09:34.461 --> 09:38.791
Our Antipodean friends encourage
athleticism at a very young age,

09:39.388 --> 09:43.039
and the Soviets
seemingly from conception.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.440
Yes, but I'm not sure you should be
taking childcare advice

09:45.465 --> 09:46.760
from the gulags.

09:46.946 --> 09:49.134
Let them play, Sister.

09:57.028 --> 09:58.653
Stand by your beds.

09:59.334 --> 10:01.037
They reckon it could be any minute.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.930
You better get some dinner on, then.

10:07.792 --> 10:10.546
Or me and the lad could
take a walk down the chippy.

10:11.072 --> 10:13.517
Yes! Hey?

10:13.542 --> 10:15.149
I'll go and do some
bread and butter.

10:15.913 --> 10:17.180
Do you want some chips, love?

10:17.205 --> 10:19.649
No, thanks, I've already got
something special planned.

10:19.743 --> 10:20.823
Ohh.

10:25.048 --> 10:28.218
I do wish Councillor Buckle had been
a bit more forthcoming about funds.

10:28.243 --> 10:31.898
If you think she's wrong
then you must change her mind.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.083
I intend to.

10:33.084 --> 10:36.397
I just, simply don't know how.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.701
Use your initiative!

10:38.726 --> 10:41.562
Use your resources,
use Sister Julienne.

10:41.651 --> 10:46.003
She knows more about this district
and its travails

10:46.004 --> 10:47.429
than anyone else in this room.

10:50.595 --> 10:54.711
Whilst I admire the enthusiasm
being shown for this project,

10:55.278 --> 10:58.297
- I don't necessarily share it.
- And nor do I.

10:58.354 --> 11:01.621
But you told Nurse Franklin
that she should listen

11:01.646 --> 11:05.020
to opposing points of view,
and so should we.

11:10.906 --> 11:12.857
May I leave the table early,
Mother Mildred?

11:12.882 --> 11:15.930
- My gran's expecting me this evening.
- Very nice.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.849
Tell me, what do you think

11:21.245 --> 11:22.634
your grandmother
would have thought

11:22.659 --> 11:24.627
of a proposal like Brook?

11:26.367 --> 11:29.517
Uh... When she was about
the age you are now.

11:32.036 --> 11:34.289
I should think she'd have
danced in the streets.

11:37.048 --> 11:39.894
She once told me her first memory
was being held up

11:39.919 --> 11:41.550
to kiss her mother in her coffin.

11:42.032 --> 11:43.859
She'd died giving birth to her
ninth child.

11:43.884 --> 11:46.088
And her second memory...

11:46.355 --> 11:49.889
..was of her dad taking his belt to
her older sister, who'd come home

11:49.914 --> 11:52.044
in the family way
and wasn't married.

11:53.056 --> 11:55.437
When he hit her in the face,
the buckle broke her tooth.

11:59.546 --> 12:03.670
I'm sorry, it was the way things were,
where I come from.

12:08.309 --> 12:10.444
And where we work... now.

12:22.555 --> 12:24.043
Oh, Miss Higgins?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.474
I wasn't expecting
visitors this evening.

12:26.499 --> 12:27.731
Nurse Crane.

12:28.028 --> 12:29.275
I trust you're well?

12:30.016 --> 12:33.214
I understand my progress
is quite satisfactory.

12:33.603 --> 12:36.286
I'll pass that on to
your well-wishers.

12:37.489 --> 12:41.205
We've had quite a volume of
enquiries about you at the surgery.

12:41.382 --> 12:44.213
Even Sergeant Woolf
has been enquiring.

12:44.732 --> 12:45.816
Has he now?

12:46.372 --> 12:48.843
Oh, I've put a little
something in here, too.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.466
It's a book of verses
by Patience Strong.

12:52.044 --> 12:55.473
Her simple words have brought me
great comfort over the years,

12:56.024 --> 12:58.721
although knowing that so many people
have you in their thoughts

12:58.746 --> 13:00.995
must be, quite gladdening.

13:03.028 --> 13:04.072
It is.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.535
Thank you, Miss Higgins.

13:17.389 --> 13:20.280
Oh, give over! You make me crazy.

13:20.305 --> 13:21.881
I thought you were feeling better.

13:21.906 --> 13:22.942
Yeah, I am.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.056
I've even made us a special dinner.

13:25.232 --> 13:26.233
Corned beef pie.

13:26.258 --> 13:28.068
Oh, you're spoiling me.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.878
Then I thought
we might have an early night.

13:34.052 --> 13:36.055
I didn't think you were
working tonight, Vince.

13:36.056 --> 13:38.715
There's a couple of
tasty races on tonight.

13:38.740 --> 13:42.812
Big crowds with loose pockets,
and a little one on the way.

13:43.415 --> 13:44.560
I'll wait up.

13:45.298 --> 13:46.326
It'll be late.

13:46.351 --> 13:47.632
I'll wait up.

13:48.081 --> 13:52.096
It's For You
by Cilla Black

14:56.806 --> 14:58.999
I'm not nicking it,
I'm just keeping it ticking over

14:59.024 --> 15:00.358
until Nurse Crane gets back.

15:00.383 --> 15:02.518
Do we know when that might be?

15:03.414 --> 15:05.539
Well, you'd best ask
the fount of all wisdom.

15:05.623 --> 15:06.900
Ah, Mother Mildred!

15:07.040 --> 15:09.294
I was just enquiring
after Nurse Crane.

15:09.682 --> 15:11.722
Wondering whether a visit
might be welcome.

15:12.076 --> 15:14.096
- From whom?
- Well, from me.

15:14.369 --> 15:16.854
Nurse Crane requires complete rest.

15:16.879 --> 15:19.660
I expect she'll receive
you when she returns.

15:19.949 --> 15:23.213
In the meantime, might you be able
to forward her this?

15:23.415 --> 15:26.748
It's a written report detailing
the activities of the Cub Scouts

15:26.773 --> 15:28.227
undertaken in her absence.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.841
I said complete rest.

15:35.196 --> 15:37.751
She's a one-woman Siegfried Line.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.712
I'll make sure she gets it.

15:41.068 --> 15:42.072
Thank you.

15:44.502 --> 15:46.035
Ah, Nurse Franklin!

15:46.702 --> 15:48.478
Can I help you with
anything, Dr Turner?

15:48.503 --> 15:51.480
Yes, I've had Heather Pugh's
results back.

15:51.946 --> 15:54.266
I wonder if you're able
to come on a home visit?

15:54.520 --> 15:55.524
Yes, of course.

15:58.312 --> 16:03.044
Mrs Pugh, I'm afraid you've tested
positive for gonorrhoea.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.653
You mean the clap?

16:07.220 --> 16:08.418
Is it serious?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.163
It's perfectly treatable,

16:10.588 --> 16:13.620
but the problem is with how
the disease is contracted.

16:14.861 --> 16:17.284
It's sexually transmitted.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.139
Then your tests are wrong.

16:24.064 --> 16:26.291
My Vince is the only man
I've ever been with.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.664
And I made him wait
till our wedding night.

16:29.060 --> 16:30.943
He will also need to be tested.

16:31.068 --> 16:32.084
What, Vince?

16:32.554 --> 16:35.257
No, he wouldn't.
We love each other.

16:35.282 --> 16:37.385
Right now, your baby
is our priority.

16:38.335 --> 16:41.853
Gonorrhoea can cause a serious eye
infection in newborns.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.308
There is a risk of permanent damage.

16:44.395 --> 16:47.160
But we're also worried
about you going into labour early,

16:47.501 --> 16:49.553
so we'd like to look
after you at the maternity home

16:49.668 --> 16:52.787
- and start your treatment.
- I don't understand.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.669
Maybe I could help
you pack some things.

16:56.886 --> 16:58.616
Evening, Doctor, Nurse.

17:01.297 --> 17:02.557
Everything all right?

17:02.582 --> 17:04.996
Vince, you have to hear this.
They've got it so wrong.

17:05.021 --> 17:06.025
What is it?

17:06.050 --> 17:07.905
Well, they think that
you've given me the clap.

17:08.430 --> 17:09.941
That can't be right, can it?

17:10.170 --> 17:12.243
Cos you'd never go
with another woman, would you?

17:15.108 --> 17:16.113
Vince?

17:24.729 --> 17:26.133
You all right, darling?

17:26.398 --> 17:28.105
She hasn't started already, has she?

17:28.364 --> 17:29.380
Bit early.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.017
We're just going
to keep an eye on her.

18:06.401 --> 18:08.433
It's lovely to see you, kid.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.060
Brought you some clean things.

18:11.153 --> 18:12.157
Good girl.

18:13.478 --> 18:17.221
And, this, from Sergeant Woolf.

18:20.347 --> 18:22.239
He seems very worried about you.

18:23.291 --> 18:27.044
There's no need to be drawing
any fanciful conclusions from that.

18:28.436 --> 18:30.492
He's your secret admirer, isn't he?

18:30.935 --> 18:33.895
- The one you told me about.
- Now, what have I just said?

18:39.072 --> 18:43.569
I had hoped it would be a case
of out of sight, out of mind.

18:44.454 --> 18:45.925
Haven't you heard?

18:46.064 --> 18:48.072
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

18:54.630 --> 18:57.654
Please tell your wife, Mr Eden,
that a midwife is on her way,

18:58.056 --> 18:59.468
and please don't panic.

19:03.080 --> 19:06.055
Mrs Eden is having
contractions in the street.

19:06.056 --> 19:07.712
I'm first on call. On my way.

19:09.084 --> 19:12.550
Meaning the next call, is yours.

19:12.575 --> 19:15.646
Yes, Sister, so I am aware.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.390
You're more than ready.

19:24.076 --> 19:26.934
I take it that this is not
your first infection?

19:27.319 --> 19:29.986
It's the clap.
We've all had a dose.

19:30.137 --> 19:32.066
I can assure you that's
not the case.

19:33.060 --> 19:35.114
I will be treating
you with penicillin.

19:35.505 --> 19:38.402
You need to abstain from sexual
contact

19:38.910 --> 19:41.085
until the infection
is completely gone

19:41.594 --> 19:43.354
or, at the very
least, use a sheath.

19:43.406 --> 19:44.443
Understood.

19:44.468 --> 19:48.240
I am eager to prevent the infection
spreading any further,

19:48.540 --> 19:51.651
and whilst I appreciate that speaking
to someone with whom

19:51.676 --> 19:53.896
you've had an extramarital affair
might be difficult...

19:53.921 --> 19:55.925
No, it wasn't an affair!

19:56.550 --> 19:57.753
I love my wife.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.746
Whatever the nature
of the romantic liaison...

20:00.771 --> 20:03.160
It wasn't that either,
it wasn't romantic, it was...

20:04.923 --> 20:06.151
It was business.

20:07.860 --> 20:09.056
I paid for it.

20:10.823 --> 20:13.486
I will still need to speak
with the woman in question.

20:16.466 --> 20:21.775
Once you're able to work unaided, I
am rendered surplus to requirements,

20:21.800 --> 20:25.115
I will go home to the mother house
when you're able to prove yourself

20:25.140 --> 20:26.333
as a member of staff.

20:27.275 --> 20:29.771
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

20:31.311 --> 20:34.414
Go home to your wife
and tell her help is on the way.

20:37.291 --> 20:41.288
Mrs Constance Blakemore,
second baby,

20:41.546 --> 20:43.562
no complications noted.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.858
Just the job for you.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.092
I hope so.

20:47.352 --> 20:49.023
Well, chop chop, child!

20:53.060 --> 20:56.088
Don't forget your most
essential instruments...

20:59.044 --> 21:01.181
..courage and humility.

21:01.470 --> 21:05.016
If you leaven one with the other,
you cannot fail.

21:18.254 --> 21:19.920
Can you manage, Sister?

21:20.260 --> 21:23.009
I'm managing perfectly well,
thank you.

21:24.714 --> 21:27.440
Why are you telling me this?
It's disgusting!

21:27.465 --> 21:31.063
Because I need you to understand
it's got nothing to do with you!

21:31.064 --> 21:32.604
I thought we'd a good time together.

21:32.963 --> 21:35.975
It was only for a couple of months
when I wasn't feeling my best.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.506
I don't think you're
meant to be in here, are you?

21:38.531 --> 21:41.174
Please, Sister, just get him out.
If you'd kindly leave.

21:41.199 --> 21:43.254
I'll never do it again, I swear.

21:43.279 --> 21:44.861
I love YOU, Heather.

21:44.886 --> 21:45.913
Please speak to her!

21:45.938 --> 21:47.902
Mr Pugh, I'm asking you to leave.

21:57.366 --> 21:58.534
She's waiting for you.

21:59.907 --> 22:02.488
Good, that's good.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.387
I suppose I'd better go up.

22:05.718 --> 22:07.665
I've taken the lad
over to my mother's. I'll..

22:07.690 --> 22:09.508
I'll just go and make
sure he's all right.

22:09.876 --> 22:12.417
Connie made a right racket last
time. I didn't want him scared.

22:12.442 --> 22:15.056
No, no, we definitely
don't want that.

22:15.081 --> 22:17.743
Don't worry, I'll be straight back
to boil the kettle and all that.

22:17.768 --> 22:19.251
You make yourself at home.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.352
I had hoped we'd get
a little more warning.

22:32.060 --> 22:35.522
A week's notice isn't very much
to prepare me and the children.

22:36.379 --> 22:37.557
And ourselves.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.630
We'll just play a couple of games

22:46.655 --> 22:48.905
and I'll buy you some chips
on the way home.

22:48.930 --> 22:51.027
What's this? Bribery and corruption?

22:51.052 --> 22:52.373
Bingo with my gran.

22:52.398 --> 22:54.730
I'm just trying to drum
up some support.

22:56.145 --> 23:00.549
I'm sorry, Val, but I do have a
previous engagement this evening.

23:00.574 --> 23:02.699
That would explain why
Cyril is in the hall.

23:02.724 --> 23:03.780
Already?

23:04.275 --> 23:05.550
How do I look?

23:06.393 --> 23:07.481
Too good for bingo.

23:14.686 --> 23:18.420
So... what are you doing tonight,
Trix?

23:21.493 --> 23:25.497
When the master of ceremonies
in the bingo hall calls out

23:25.522 --> 23:31.350
"the Lord is my Shepherd", he is in
fact referring to the number 23.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.452
Miss Anderson!

23:35.481 --> 23:38.702
May I say you're looking especially
elegant this evening?

23:39.056 --> 23:42.028
Thank you, Cyril.
You look very nice too.

23:42.718 --> 23:44.509
You'll have to excuse
us now, Sister.

23:44.534 --> 23:46.289
We don't want to be late
for Cliff Richard.

23:46.314 --> 23:48.086
Oh, actually, we can't be late

23:48.111 --> 23:49.772
because the cinema is closed
tonight.

23:49.912 --> 23:52.059
I just walked past
and there's a sign up saying

23:52.060 --> 23:53.338
that a projector's broken.

23:53.501 --> 23:56.398
Oh, no! And we're all dressed up.

23:57.057 --> 23:59.206
I could fetch the bike and take us
to the social club.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.792
No, I don't think so.

24:00.817 --> 24:04.567
An evening replete with
delights awaits you,

24:04.592 --> 24:07.998
should you choose to join
your companions at the bingo.

24:08.436 --> 24:09.820
I hadn't thought of that.

24:10.056 --> 24:11.978
We can wait for the others
and go with them.

24:12.003 --> 24:14.397
Wouldn't you rather
a nice walk by the river?

24:17.426 --> 24:21.471
I think he fears
the element of mathematics.

24:22.720 --> 24:27.270
You are an engineer -
numbers should not daunt you.

24:27.483 --> 24:32.487
The phrase "legs eleven"
is almost self-explanatory.

24:33.621 --> 24:36.542
Right, so that's done.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.285
Um, next?

24:38.861 --> 24:41.540
Well, I'm going to shave you,
Mrs Blackmore,

24:41.769 --> 24:44.407
- if that's all right with you?
- You're in charge, Sister.

24:45.449 --> 24:48.590
Yes, I suppose I am, really.
Good.

24:48.615 --> 24:53.178
Um, now shave, and then
I'll prepare you an enema.

24:53.203 --> 24:54.662
Oh, no need for that.

24:54.857 --> 24:56.833
Mother Nature's beaten you to it.

24:58.056 --> 24:59.246
Oh!

25:04.068 --> 25:06.716
Who's got room for some
raspberry ripple?

25:08.875 --> 25:11.406
It's a good job I bought two blocks.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.430
Um, before we have pudding,
we need to talk to you all.

25:16.751 --> 25:18.807
We have had some news today.

25:18.832 --> 25:20.014
Good news.

25:20.597 --> 25:24.322
May is finally going
to be joining her new family.

25:26.175 --> 25:27.287
When?

25:28.064 --> 25:29.095
Soon.

25:29.916 --> 25:33.313
The Tunnocks have been waiting a
long time for May to join them.

25:33.338 --> 25:34.612
And how's that good news?

25:34.642 --> 25:40.773
Timothy, I know that makes us all
a little sad, but we should be happy

25:40.798 --> 25:42.039
that May is going to be with

25:42.064 --> 25:44.932
her new mummy and daddy
and her sister in her new home.

25:44.957 --> 25:46.447
She's already got a new home!

25:47.032 --> 25:49.964
You knew that May was only staying
with us until Mr Tunnock

25:49.989 --> 25:50.993
was feeling better.

25:54.586 --> 25:59.202
So, what about that
raspberry-ripple ice cream?

26:05.359 --> 26:07.726
Oh, gosh! Not sure I've got
the concentration for this.

26:07.751 --> 26:10.253
Eyes down for your first game,
ladies...

26:10.561 --> 26:12.107
..and gentlemen.

26:13.076 --> 26:17.955
Starting with buckle my shoe, 32.

26:17.980 --> 26:19.994
Oh! Perfect.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.203
She's a natural.

26:21.228 --> 26:23.051
I think she just heard
the word shoe, Gran.

26:23.052 --> 26:26.257
And now we have, legs eleven.

26:26.663 --> 26:28.814
Oh, I know that one!
Give me your pen.

26:32.056 --> 26:33.059
Hey what's wrong?

26:33.060 --> 26:34.567
Oh, these chairs!

26:35.231 --> 26:36.773
Hope's more forgiving.

26:37.288 --> 26:38.661
I had to bring in a cushion.

26:38.686 --> 26:41.294
And it's Burlington Bertie.

26:41.319 --> 26:42.427
Is it your boil again?

26:42.452 --> 26:43.693
- Shh!
- Number 30.

26:43.718 --> 26:44.722
Eyes down.

26:49.846 --> 26:53.158
Well, that was the quietest bedtime
we've had in a while.

26:53.183 --> 26:54.971
They didn't even want a story.

26:55.248 --> 26:56.791
Have you been called out?

26:56.816 --> 27:00.310
I'm going to see Mr Pugh's preferred
establishment,

27:00.815 --> 27:03.498
and I thought I'd better visit
during business hours.

27:07.076 --> 27:08.649
Will we ever see her again?

27:09.064 --> 27:10.065
May?

27:10.587 --> 27:11.591
I don't know.

27:14.060 --> 27:16.907
That will depend on her new family,
I suppose.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.710
But if they say we can?

27:19.257 --> 27:21.266
Then of course we will.

27:21.855 --> 27:23.116
Oh, Timothy!

27:26.056 --> 27:29.059
Being a foster family
is about showing children

27:29.060 --> 27:31.841
how a normal family life
can be until they move on

27:31.866 --> 27:33.310
to their permanent families.

27:34.658 --> 27:38.339
May's turned into such a happy
and confident little girl

27:38.364 --> 27:40.584
- since living with us.
- I know, Mum.

27:41.829 --> 27:43.530
I just worry about Angela.

27:43.906 --> 27:45.359
She won't understand.

27:46.635 --> 27:49.825
Young children are more robust
than we give them credit for.

27:54.293 --> 27:55.611
Is there something wrong?

27:55.776 --> 27:59.039
Oh, I'm sorry, no, nothing's amiss.

27:59.064 --> 28:02.035
I just want to make sure
everything goes swimmingly for you,

28:02.036 --> 28:03.091
like with your son.

28:03.092 --> 28:04.354
You're all right, love.

28:04.723 --> 28:06.511
Can't you do whatever
you have to do?

28:08.016 --> 28:09.552
Oh, here we go again!

28:16.913 --> 28:18.147
Oh!

28:28.431 --> 28:30.925
The thing is, it's not
about what I need to do.

28:31.528 --> 28:34.141
It's about making sure
that you can do what you need to do.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.556
I don't catch your drift.

28:36.173 --> 28:40.561
Well, you did say you were quite
loud during your last delivery.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.313
It's just that, last time, Eric
said I put the fear of Go...

28:43.440 --> 28:45.031
..God into him.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.328
Well, I've already got that.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.011
That's it, Mrs Blakemore.
Give it all you've got!

29:04.348 --> 29:06.597
5 and 8, 58.

29:13.792 --> 29:15.103
5 and 6...

29:15.128 --> 29:17.124
Was she worth it?

29:17.786 --> 29:19.210
76.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.239
House!

29:21.189 --> 29:22.193
House!

29:24.402 --> 29:25.728
Beginner's luck!

29:26.358 --> 29:30.252
Tell him - winners get the teas,
three sugars in mine,

29:30.277 --> 29:32.044
and I'll have a ginger nut.

29:35.539 --> 29:36.583
Oh, Gran.

29:41.060 --> 29:44.792
Can't take these - you won
them fair and square.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.874
I'm not sure Valerie's
grandmother would agree.

29:47.899 --> 29:48.900
True.

29:49.445 --> 29:52.040
Winning the raffle did
add insult to injury.

29:54.387 --> 29:57.339
She had her heart set
on that cake. Mm-hm!

29:58.025 --> 29:59.029
My luck was in.

30:00.072 --> 30:01.906
It has been for a couple of weeks.

30:09.329 --> 30:10.813
It'll be boiled in a minute.

30:11.517 --> 30:13.226
There's biscuits in the tin.

30:13.251 --> 30:16.002
I would have preferred
a slice of Madeira.

30:17.762 --> 30:18.806
Oh, Gran!

30:18.962 --> 30:20.604
Only joking.

30:21.052 --> 30:22.319
You've got lovely friends...

30:23.954 --> 30:26.918
That's it, you're going to see
Dr Turner in the morning.

30:26.943 --> 30:29.963
It's nothing a warm flannel
won't sort out.

30:32.354 --> 30:33.932
Oh, if it'll make you happy.

30:34.744 --> 30:38.084
You always were a bossy
little madam, weren't you?

30:38.314 --> 30:40.995
Yeah. I wonder who I got that from!

30:48.658 --> 30:52.152
Dr Turner, I wasn't
expecting a house call.

30:52.177 --> 30:54.414
I'm here in a professional capacity.

30:54.996 --> 30:56.713
I think it's best I come in.

30:59.544 --> 31:01.340
They say you forget the pain,
don't they?

31:01.365 --> 31:03.503
But I'm sure it hurts
more than last time.

31:03.873 --> 31:05.710
It's not just round
the front this time.

31:06.060 --> 31:07.657
Oh, my backside!

31:08.494 --> 31:11.440
You've got pain in your rectum?
Yeah, I'd say.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.185
It's not the usual pain, either.

31:13.829 --> 31:15.367
Oh, it's sharp!

31:15.659 --> 31:20.416
I see. I think perhaps we should
get you on your hands and knees.

31:20.441 --> 31:24.290
All right, but first I think
you need to turn a knob

31:24.315 --> 31:25.801
on that thing to get it started.

31:26.064 --> 31:29.000
So I do. Silly me!

31:29.389 --> 31:30.445
Ooh!

31:33.701 --> 31:37.082
You'll need to come to the surgery
tomorrow for your second injection,

31:38.056 --> 31:39.237
and in the meantime...

31:39.331 --> 31:41.531
Closed for business, I know.

31:41.556 --> 31:43.773
And please think
about what I said.

31:44.549 --> 31:46.452
There are ways to
protect yourself.

31:46.481 --> 31:48.469
The customers just won't wear 'em.

31:49.279 --> 31:51.868
Sorry, love, not working tonight.

31:54.136 --> 31:56.628
Mr Pugh? I think we should talk!

31:56.653 --> 31:58.241
Yeah, well, I don't,
so leave me alone.

31:58.265 --> 32:01.583
Not until you understand how
damaging this behaviour can be,

32:02.039 --> 32:03.059
and not just to you.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.546
Of course I flaming understand!
I'm not stupid.

32:05.676 --> 32:07.847
- Then tell me why you're here.
- I don't know!

32:08.493 --> 32:10.406
Look, I didn't even mean to!

32:10.911 --> 32:12.685
I didn't know what else
to do with myself,

32:12.710 --> 32:13.915
not with my Heather gone.

32:14.108 --> 32:16.895
This is exactly the behaviour
that caused your separation

32:16.920 --> 32:18.164
in the first place!

32:18.393 --> 32:19.737
Don't you think I know that?

32:24.857 --> 32:28.260
Mrs Blakemore,
I think I've found the problem.

32:28.467 --> 32:30.857
We have what's called
a compound presentation here.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.622
- What does that mean?
- Baby's trying to come out elbow first,

32:34.384 --> 32:37.456
which explains the pain and why
things are taking a little bit

32:37.481 --> 32:38.565
longer than expected.

32:39.404 --> 32:41.149
It's very unusual.

32:41.446 --> 32:43.207
But you have seen it before?

32:43.596 --> 32:48.374
I've read about them a lot,
but I've never seen one in real life.

32:48.988 --> 32:50.357
But don't worry, Mrs Blakemore,

32:50.382 --> 32:52.895
I'm going to ask your husband
to telephone for another midwife.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.931
No, let's not mess about, love!
You've got me this far.

32:55.956 --> 32:57.978
A second pair of hands
will come in useful.

32:58.072 --> 33:00.308
I think you're going to need
a little bit of extra help,

33:00.333 --> 33:01.420
to get baby out.

33:09.297 --> 33:11.146
It's not long now,
Mrs Blakemore.

33:11.661 --> 33:13.113
Little breaths again.

33:24.824 --> 33:27.155
I'm just making a little cut
to help baby out.

33:30.060 --> 33:31.063
Here we go.

33:33.056 --> 33:35.008
Push, push!

33:35.639 --> 33:38.293
Here comes baby, gentle, gentle!

33:41.076 --> 33:44.135
Here comes the little one.
Oh, Mrs Blakemore!

33:44.165 --> 33:45.175
Here's baby.

33:46.724 --> 33:47.794
A little girl!

33:49.072 --> 33:51.499
Is she all right? Have I hurt her?

33:51.885 --> 33:53.183
She's absolutely perfect.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.343
Well done, Mum!

34:05.036 --> 34:10.060
You took your own time...
my girl... didn't you?

34:13.060 --> 34:14.531
Well done, you, Sister!

34:16.353 --> 34:17.831
We don't need back-up.

34:18.733 --> 34:22.701
We did it on our own.
Just the three of us.

34:35.753 --> 34:38.493
Warmest congratulations,
Sister Frances.

34:39.060 --> 34:43.456
You have earned an extra egg
and an additional slice of bacon.

34:43.481 --> 34:45.188
You must be exhausted.
Come and sit down.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.896
I can't.
I've not finished my work yet.

34:50.068 --> 34:51.072
Oh!

34:54.587 --> 35:00.969
Thank you, God, for not leaving me
alone when I was on my own.

35:02.195 --> 35:03.265
Thank you.

35:04.877 --> 35:05.881
Amen.

35:10.076 --> 35:12.052
Time for your injection, sweetie.

35:14.466 --> 35:15.834
Back to bed, ladies!

35:16.205 --> 35:18.972
- Talk of the ward, am I?
- Not at all.

35:19.488 --> 35:21.281
I know what it's like
around here for gossip.

35:21.762 --> 35:24.692
What do you think me and Connie talk
about all day? The price of cheese?

35:26.196 --> 35:27.573
Maybe it's just my turn.

35:29.769 --> 35:31.488
Maybe I'm getting what I deserve.

35:31.809 --> 35:34.374
I don't think that's true,
not for a second.

35:34.572 --> 35:36.813
I thought I was doing everything
I was supposed to,

35:37.642 --> 35:39.167
in the house and in bed.

35:41.518 --> 35:44.746
"Worth the wait."
That's what he said to me

35:45.345 --> 35:48.048
when I wouldn't,
before we were married.

35:50.206 --> 35:51.849
Obviously, I wasn't worth the wait.

35:53.335 --> 35:54.910
I wasn't worth anything at all,

35:56.232 --> 35:58.908
because he had me at home
but still he'd rather pay.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.908
You must have really been in pain
with this, Mrs Dyer.

36:09.214 --> 36:10.475
I've had worse.

36:11.072 --> 36:12.167
It's only a boil.

36:12.892 --> 36:15.476
It's actually a cluster of several
boils,

36:15.501 --> 36:17.402
commonly known as a carbuncle.

36:17.615 --> 36:19.425
Even the name sounds horrible.

36:19.741 --> 36:22.238
A course of antibiotics
ought to see it off,

36:22.520 --> 36:29.255
but... I, am going to
take a quick swab...

36:29.806 --> 36:32.593
..and test to see
if it's being caused

36:32.618 --> 36:36.654
by Staphylococcus aureus
or Streptococcus pyogenes,

36:36.863 --> 36:38.163
or anything else.

36:38.419 --> 36:41.431
I'd rather tell people
I had something like that

36:41.456 --> 36:43.004
than a carbuncle.

36:43.455 --> 36:47.023
I like medical names -
they're more elegant.

36:47.048 --> 36:49.682
Well, whatever the cause,
you'll need to keep this area

36:49.707 --> 36:51.953
and your hands scrupulously clean.

36:52.486 --> 36:55.131
I'll arrange for you to have your
dressing changed every day

36:55.156 --> 36:57.096
when you have your
penicillin injection.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.223
My Val can do all of that.

36:59.702 --> 37:01.195
It's best you come here.

37:01.702 --> 37:03.734
I need to make sure
you're behaving yourself!

37:09.586 --> 37:11.570
Looking around.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.192
Here she is!

37:14.333 --> 37:17.539
The woman of the hour!
Come in, Sister, have a drink.

37:17.564 --> 37:19.473
Not whilst I'm still on duty,
Mr Blakemore.

37:21.578 --> 37:24.598
It really is a little too soon for
Mrs Blakemore to be having visitors.

37:24.713 --> 37:27.059
Oh, Connie doesn't mind,
she's having a lie-down.

37:27.261 --> 37:29.006
Could sleep through a hurricane,
that one.

37:29.857 --> 37:31.865
Sorry, I'm going to need
this little one.

37:48.044 --> 37:51.040
Mrs Blakemore,
whatever is the matter?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.329
I wish I knew.

38:01.802 --> 38:05.199
Oh, no! Oh, not now!

38:07.440 --> 38:08.682
Nurse!

38:09.712 --> 38:11.668
I've never been one for tears.

38:12.591 --> 38:16.611
Once I started, I couldn't stop.
I'm so tired.

38:18.210 --> 38:20.569
I can't settle her.

38:21.060 --> 38:24.036
She's still bruised
because of the way she was born.

38:24.905 --> 38:27.925
But not as bruised as you,
Mrs Blakemore.

38:28.664 --> 38:30.560
Remember, you've had stitches.

38:30.585 --> 38:32.495
You shouldn't even
have been out of bed.

38:40.072 --> 38:41.665
It's time for everyone to leave.

38:42.461 --> 38:44.336
Auntie Jean's only
just got here!

38:44.361 --> 38:47.365
Mr Blakemore, your wife's just
been through a difficult birth!

38:47.390 --> 38:48.867
Connie loves having her house full.

38:48.892 --> 38:50.880
Then why is she crying
in the bedroom?

38:52.749 --> 38:57.216
Now, please, everybody,
Connie needs to be left in peace.

39:01.450 --> 39:02.454
Thank you.

39:07.177 --> 39:09.539
If the baby's decided it's time,
there's not a lot we can do

39:09.564 --> 39:11.788
about it, which is why
we brought you here,

39:11.813 --> 39:13.662
where you and the baby
will get the best care.

39:14.189 --> 39:15.459
What about Vince?

39:16.052 --> 39:17.206
What about him, sweetie?

39:17.231 --> 39:18.531
Do you think he should know?

39:19.076 --> 39:20.193
That it's happening?

39:20.218 --> 39:22.047
Only if it's what you want.

39:22.048 --> 39:23.811
I don't know what I want.

39:24.305 --> 39:26.365
We talked about what
today would be like,

39:27.064 --> 39:29.924
the day we became parents,
and it wasn't like this.

39:30.758 --> 39:32.600
We'll see if we can get word to him.

39:48.638 --> 39:49.892
How's Heather doing?

39:51.913 --> 39:53.656
She's still at the
maternity home.

39:53.982 --> 39:54.988
Um...

39:58.305 --> 40:00.238
..would you see that she gets these?

40:00.578 --> 40:02.866
We take it in turn to buy 'em.

40:03.244 --> 40:04.762
She likes the recipes.

40:12.044 --> 40:16.802
May I say this feels
like quite an honour, Sister.

40:17.615 --> 40:20.362
I thought I was going to get one
of the junior nurses.

40:20.387 --> 40:22.028
The privilege is all mine, Mrs Dyer.

40:23.036 --> 40:26.266
Did the doctor find out
what germ caused this?

40:26.443 --> 40:30.280
According to your notes, it seems
to be Streptococcus pyogenes.

40:30.580 --> 40:33.959
We used to dread these infections
before antibiotics.

40:34.264 --> 40:37.092
If they were picked up by women
after childbirth,

40:38.090 --> 40:39.189
they would die.

40:41.583 --> 40:44.237
That's all finished.
You can adjust your clothing.

40:45.645 --> 40:46.645
Oh.

40:48.589 --> 40:52.204
You've got a superior touch.
Hardly felt a thing.

40:53.156 --> 40:55.786
I hope my Val turns out
to be as good as you.

40:56.615 --> 40:58.856
Valerie is an excellent midwife

40:59.158 --> 41:01.630
and a thoroughly nice young woman.

41:01.655 --> 41:05.152
You can't go wrong when you've got
a sharp brain and warm heart.

41:05.177 --> 41:06.491
She's got both.

41:07.028 --> 41:09.266
When she said about
going off to nursing,

41:09.291 --> 41:13.066
I said to myself,
"You watch her go, Else.

41:13.578 --> 41:16.764
"She'll do everything
you never did."

41:17.519 --> 41:19.461
Did you have aspirations
to be a nurse?

41:19.636 --> 41:22.039
It weren't for the likes
of me in them days.

41:22.551 --> 41:25.643
Being a nurse was
something ladies did.

41:26.425 --> 41:29.276
Anyway, I left school at 12.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.356
I'd never have had the learning.

41:42.936 --> 41:45.988
Mr Pugh, your wife is in labour,
and she's asking for you.

41:46.756 --> 41:48.853
So if you would like
to put on a shirt...

41:49.733 --> 41:52.590
No! I'm the last thing she needs.
The last thing anybody needs.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.621
You saw that for
yourself the other night.

41:54.646 --> 41:56.978
What I saw is a man
who needs help.

42:04.052 --> 42:06.359
It started when I was
on National Service.

42:07.721 --> 42:09.320
They sent me to Berlin.

42:10.268 --> 42:12.705
I'd barely been past the end
of my street before.

42:14.396 --> 42:15.418
I was miserable.

42:16.032 --> 42:17.507
I took it out on everyone else.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.425
I kept getting in fights.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.303
The next time I threw a punch,

42:21.360 --> 42:23.065
it was going to be
the glasshouse for me.

42:25.415 --> 42:29.860
Luckily, I had a sergeant
who knew I just needed to er,

42:31.653 --> 42:32.916
let off some steam.

42:34.316 --> 42:36.023
He took you to a brothel?

42:37.771 --> 42:38.799
It worked.

42:40.068 --> 42:41.974
I settled down and I did my time.

42:42.950 --> 42:46.815
But when I came home...
I couldn't stop.

42:49.347 --> 42:50.493
Until I met Heather.

42:51.430 --> 42:52.882
So what changed?

42:53.740 --> 42:55.698
It started when she got pregnant.

42:57.032 --> 43:00.749
Self-destructive behaviour
is not an unusual reaction

43:00.774 --> 43:02.288
to high-stress situations.

43:02.486 --> 43:04.850
Drink, gambling, narcotics,

43:04.875 --> 43:06.738
I've seen them all used
in that manner.

43:08.335 --> 43:10.783
I think your visits
to prostitutes are the same.

43:11.483 --> 43:13.400
I've everything a man could want.

43:13.826 --> 43:16.263
I've got a beautiful wife
and a baby on the way.

43:16.288 --> 43:18.327
Becoming a father is wonderful,

43:19.529 --> 43:21.642
but it's also the biggest
responsibility

43:21.667 --> 43:23.063
you will ever have to shoulder.

43:23.064 --> 43:25.730
And I've buckled under the pressure
before it's even born.

43:25.755 --> 43:30.176
That may be, but you have got
the chance to rebuild.

43:34.490 --> 43:35.671
Is he here?

43:35.920 --> 43:39.098
He's right outside, Mrs Pugh,
and that's where he'll stay,

43:39.123 --> 43:40.499
unless you say otherwise.

43:40.936 --> 43:43.159
Let's concentrate on the job
in hand, shall we?

43:46.382 --> 43:48.044
That's good, Mrs Pugh.

43:49.186 --> 43:51.096
Now slow down a little.

43:51.605 --> 43:52.911
Gently does it.

43:53.845 --> 43:55.336
And just breathe for me.

43:58.431 --> 44:01.334
Baby's head's been born.
Very nearly there.

44:05.386 --> 44:06.589
That's it.

44:07.293 --> 44:09.294
Now just another push, Mrs Pugh.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.096
There we go.

44:14.721 --> 44:16.064
A little girl.

44:17.675 --> 44:18.731
Well done, sweetie.

44:22.573 --> 44:23.797
How are her eyes?

44:24.076 --> 44:25.661
Has she caught it from me?

44:25.945 --> 44:26.955
Let's find out.

44:48.358 --> 44:50.207
No obvious signs of infection.

44:53.188 --> 44:55.019
I still think we should
start treatment.

44:58.763 --> 44:59.767
Ssh.

45:09.060 --> 45:11.138
Quick, it's the Ann Packer race.

45:12.699 --> 45:14.547
Run, Miss Packer,

45:14.572 --> 45:17.847
you are Artemis,
goddess of the chase.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.584
- Give it some welly, love!
- Oh, she's got herself boxed in!

45:22.609 --> 45:23.817
Come on, Ann!

45:32.000 --> 45:33.756
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

45:34.008 --> 45:36.895
Hello, I need to speak
to Nurse Dyer.

45:36.925 --> 45:38.409
Tell her it's Auntie Flo.

45:38.868 --> 45:40.040
Valerie!

45:45.616 --> 45:47.776
It's your Aunt Flo,
it sounds urgent.

45:48.344 --> 45:51.152
- Flo?
- Val? I need you down the pub.

45:51.241 --> 45:54.173
Bring your nurse's bag
and come round the back.

45:54.198 --> 45:55.677
Your gran's here with me.

46:02.661 --> 46:05.769
Weird that someone's gone into
labour in between two kegs of mild.

46:06.718 --> 46:09.437
I don't know. It sounds like there's
been some sort of accident. Hm.

46:09.722 --> 46:10.986
Perhaps I should come with you.

46:12.445 --> 46:14.027
She might just do it.

46:14.052 --> 46:17.128
Look at her go!
Go on, darling! Ha-ha!

46:17.153 --> 46:18.153
Yes!

46:22.674 --> 46:24.653
Auntie Flo, what's happened?

46:25.374 --> 46:28.116
I didn't send for two of you,
I sent for her.

46:28.141 --> 46:30.610
It sounded urgent - we thought
you might need reinforcements.

46:30.635 --> 46:33.088
You'd better get upstairs. Go on!

46:36.483 --> 46:39.844
There you are, darling,
I told you it was on its way.

46:43.487 --> 46:45.165
What sort of help
does she need, Gran?

46:46.583 --> 46:49.496
Help stopping the bleeding,
help cleaning her up.

46:50.016 --> 46:51.808
Help if the baby comes away.

46:57.474 --> 47:00.069
I take it that that was in fact
the object of this enterprise?

47:00.094 --> 47:02.449
- Yes. It was...
- Gran.

47:03.052 --> 47:05.064
Gran, has someone
been doing an abortion?

47:06.556 --> 47:07.560
Yes.

47:09.537 --> 47:10.724
Me.

47:18.056 --> 47:22.631
You know it goes on all over,
just like everybody else does.

47:23.008 --> 47:25.987
She ain't never had this
happen before, not once.

47:26.549 --> 47:27.777
You wanted towels.

47:27.802 --> 47:30.690
Don't you dare bring these filthy
articles anywhere near my patient.

47:30.715 --> 47:33.226
Throw them on the floor, please,
so I don't slip in this mess.

47:33.635 --> 47:37.494
Thank you. Can you put some gloves
on, Nurse Dyer, in case I need you

47:37.519 --> 47:38.948
to prepare some ergometrine?

47:39.814 --> 47:41.605
Sweetheart,
can you tell me your name?

47:41.630 --> 47:42.658
It's Teresa.

47:43.255 --> 47:45.525
I'm just going to take
a little look down below, Teresa.

47:46.406 --> 47:48.511
I send them home to bed usually.

47:49.056 --> 47:51.179
They lose it at night,
by the next day.

47:51.204 --> 47:52.800
Move your knees apart for me.

47:57.352 --> 47:59.830
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Good girl.

48:00.845 --> 48:02.144
We're going to sort this out.

48:02.169 --> 48:05.691
I reckon there was already
something wrong with her.

48:06.232 --> 48:08.479
It's the haemorrhage
she's having now that concerns me.

48:08.504 --> 48:11.188
- Did you use instruments?
- Yes.

48:15.418 --> 48:16.482
Thank you.

48:17.383 --> 48:20.279
Nurse Dyer, I need sterile pads

48:20.414 --> 48:22.084
and I need you to call
for an ambulance.

48:22.378 --> 48:25.016
I can't do that. You know I can't.

48:25.291 --> 48:26.765
It's why we sent for 'er.

48:29.024 --> 48:32.948
You can and you will,
because if either Nurse Dyer or I

48:32.973 --> 48:34.854
have to leave this poor girl's side
to do it,

48:34.879 --> 48:37.667
we'll be coming back here
with a police officer, won't we?

48:38.610 --> 48:39.643
Yes.

48:40.497 --> 48:42.892
I don't want my mum and dad to know.

48:42.917 --> 48:46.035
I promise, Teresa, right now,
nobody in this room is thinking

48:46.036 --> 48:47.303
about anyone but you.

48:51.040 --> 48:56.102
Oh, Mother Mildred, can I help you?

48:56.127 --> 48:59.265
I'm struggling with
a recalcitrant shoelace.

48:59.354 --> 49:01.708
You may assist me, if you wish.

49:04.448 --> 49:06.488
Is that your suitcase, Mother?

49:11.289 --> 49:13.596
I arrived without fanfare,

49:14.235 --> 49:16.029
I leave the same way.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.648
But why now?

49:19.300 --> 49:21.494
Remember what I told you, child.

49:22.643 --> 49:26.203
Because now...
I can.

49:33.762 --> 49:35.651
Still no signs of infection.

49:37.861 --> 49:42.043
But, we will continue the drops

49:42.044 --> 49:43.680
just to be on the safe side.

49:44.334 --> 49:47.341
Infection's not always obvious
so soon after birth.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.572
Is Vince still here?

49:51.547 --> 49:53.957
He is. Would you like to see him?

49:54.196 --> 49:59.835
I don't know. I thought I did,
but I can't just forget what he did,

50:00.018 --> 50:01.655
and I can't pretend
it didn't happen.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.666
And neither should you, Mrs Pugh.

50:05.250 --> 50:07.286
Maybe it would help
to talk about it.

50:07.311 --> 50:09.199
And how are we
supposed to do that?

50:09.504 --> 50:13.220
I'd be happy to refer you to the
National Marriage Guidance Council.

50:13.386 --> 50:15.703
It's a service where
you and your husband

50:15.728 --> 50:18.349
can discuss your relationship
with a counsellor -

50:18.732 --> 50:21.305
someone who can help you talk
about what happened.

50:22.614 --> 50:25.646
If, you're both ready
to be honest with each other.

50:26.032 --> 50:27.628
And do you think Vince is ready?

50:28.624 --> 50:29.742
I do.

50:51.538 --> 50:55.072
I'm cold. There will be another
blanket in the ambulance, sweetie.

50:55.273 --> 50:57.382
It's Pullman service
all the way now.

50:58.064 --> 51:00.708
I'm not leaving her. I think she
might miscarry en route.

51:04.335 --> 51:06.969
Back stairs, if you'd oblige me.

51:10.468 --> 51:11.993
Why did you send for me?

51:13.036 --> 51:16.051
You've had training,
and we was in trouble.

51:16.052 --> 51:17.988
Well, you're in worse trouble now!

51:18.731 --> 51:21.206
What you did in here was criminal.

51:21.231 --> 51:23.390
And I don't just mean
because it was against the law.

51:29.690 --> 51:31.718
Mrs Pugh, may we?

51:36.068 --> 51:39.012
Oh, my God, look at her.

51:40.289 --> 51:41.414
She's perfect.

51:43.193 --> 51:44.233
She's perfect.

51:45.388 --> 51:47.205
Heather, I'm sorry.

51:47.925 --> 51:48.933
Please.

51:50.410 --> 51:54.195
So, here's how it's going to be
when we come home.

51:54.700 --> 51:56.088
No more doing nights.

51:56.536 --> 51:59.059
I want you home at a decent hour
from now on.

51:59.060 --> 52:01.049
But I'll 'ave to stop
working at the dogs.

52:01.074 --> 52:03.496
I want you where I can
see you, Vincent Pugh.

52:03.903 --> 52:07.035
Every single night.
And if I ever hear of you...

52:07.036 --> 52:08.324
Oh, you won't, I promise.

52:09.244 --> 52:12.264
Because the doctor says there are
people we can talk to about it.

52:12.758 --> 52:14.370
He says it might help.

52:15.816 --> 52:18.199
What, us? Talk about...

52:19.344 --> 52:22.470
- ..the thing we don't talk about?
- Yes, Vince, that.

52:23.258 --> 52:25.821
And the other thing
we don't talk about, which is us.

52:26.321 --> 52:28.001
I'll do whatever it takes.

52:29.920 --> 52:33.773
And I want to call her Agnes -
after my mum.

52:45.508 --> 52:47.351
What are you all gawping at?

52:53.513 --> 52:57.802
Did it not occur to you - I might get
into trouble, Gran?

52:58.485 --> 53:02.221
I could even lose my job,
because you dragged me into this.

53:04.186 --> 53:08.788
No-one's going to tell on you.
Not me, not Flo.

53:09.794 --> 53:11.259
- You're family.
- Oh!

53:12.072 --> 53:14.200
Even if you do forget
where you're from

53:14.764 --> 53:16.809
and whose side you ought to be on.

53:18.731 --> 53:20.457
You haven't seen
the things I've seen.

53:23.207 --> 53:26.465
You haven't seen little
boys left motherless,

53:28.163 --> 53:30.422
young women shaking with fever,

53:30.447 --> 53:33.663
passing clots of rotten matter
into a toilet bowl.

53:33.688 --> 53:35.067
You're in my way.

53:35.068 --> 53:39.047
You, haven't seen patients
crying in my clinic

53:39.048 --> 53:40.661
because they're married now.

53:42.036 --> 53:45.044
They're married and it's safe,

53:46.136 --> 53:48.024
but they can't hang onto a pregnancy

53:48.684 --> 53:53.011
because they have been so badly
lacerated by something

53:53.012 --> 53:56.734
someone like you keeps in her
sideboard drawer

53:56.759 --> 53:57.774
or underneath her sink.

53:57.799 --> 54:00.773
Are you saying that what
I see don't matter?

54:01.158 --> 54:03.958
I see them crying,
I see it all the time.

54:04.931 --> 54:10.337
The girls who are trying to feed
five kids on a tin of corned beef.

54:11.606 --> 54:14.581
Or worse - with black eyes,
covered in pan stick,

54:15.056 --> 54:18.624
and a husband who drinks
a skinful every night.

54:18.649 --> 54:24.056
I bet I can match
you tear for bloody tear!

54:25.060 --> 54:27.197
And you know what, Nurse Dyer?

54:28.052 --> 54:30.080
I send them home smiling.

54:31.597 --> 54:33.609
You hurt people, Gran.

54:35.427 --> 54:38.796
You hurt them.
You put things inside them,

54:38.821 --> 54:41.741
inside parts of the body
that you can't even name.

54:41.766 --> 54:46.745
But I do it because
they ask me to, beg me to.

54:47.378 --> 54:48.462
Pay you to.

54:55.457 --> 54:57.913
I don't charge as much as others.

54:58.757 --> 55:00.381
Most ask £10.

55:00.937 --> 55:04.853
Even Guinness gives it
a whiff of Harley Street.

55:04.878 --> 55:05.902
Oh.

55:06.044 --> 55:09.289
This is not Harley Street, Gran.
Look at it.

55:09.775 --> 55:13.024
Look at this room! It's filthy.
Look at your hands.

55:13.331 --> 55:17.037
I know what's clean
and what's not clean.

55:17.062 --> 55:18.196
You are covered in boils.

55:18.221 --> 55:20.706
I wouldn't give you a job making
flamin' sandwiches!

55:21.771 --> 55:24.379
You don't really need low-paid work,
do you,

55:25.347 --> 55:27.077
with your oven full of banknotes.

55:29.028 --> 55:31.076
£7 is what I charge.

55:43.300 --> 55:45.189
And that's how much it matters.

55:49.866 --> 55:51.378
Now do you believe me?

55:54.004 --> 55:56.946
I believe you're burning the
evidence before the police get here.

55:57.503 --> 56:00.778
The police won't come
unless someone calls them.

56:07.618 --> 56:09.525
People go to prison
for what you've done.

56:11.177 --> 56:13.718
There's abortionists in Holloway
serving eight years.

56:15.324 --> 56:16.348
I know.

56:20.379 --> 56:23.095
And so Ann Packer of
Great Britain

56:23.096 --> 56:26.015
receives the gold medal
for the 800...

56:26.016 --> 56:28.153
We can never
foretell

56:28.178 --> 56:30.312
when our fortunes will turn

56:31.016 --> 56:33.694
or when the story will change.

56:37.525 --> 56:40.590
Sometimes, we see each other
through fresh eyes,

56:40.707 --> 56:42.244
and there's no joy at all.

56:43.834 --> 56:45.834
We see what was concealed

56:46.016 --> 56:47.283
and what is shameful.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.173
We see what is true.

56:51.183 --> 56:54.179
And nothing familiar remains.

57:02.230 --> 57:04.759
We're going to have
to report what happened.

57:04.784 --> 57:07.067
It's the sort of thing
that makes your blood run cold.

57:07.421 --> 57:10.400
I'm launching a fund-raising drive
and the first event

57:10.425 --> 57:12.259
is going to be the Ballroom of Hope.

57:12.504 --> 57:14.597
There's a new patient
