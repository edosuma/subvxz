-Whoa.
-In the middle of something here.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.884
We had a deal.
Time to hold up your end.

34:58.096 --> 35:01.008
Fine. Just let me finish
and then you'll get what you want.

35:05.020 --> 35:08.228
You know what? I've waited long enough.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.848
You've messed with enough
people's heads.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.774
We leave now or I'm putting a bullet
in yours.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.066
If you shoot me, neither one of us get
what we want.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.244
Just let me finish with Nikita,
and then we'll go.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.956
-I can't let you do that.
-Don't tell me you've gone soft.

35:28.376 --> 35:32.039
Don't blame him. I put a tracker
on that box right after we got it from Ari.

35:32.255 --> 35:35.213
Now, put the box down
and back away from Nikita.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.290
And here I thought you trusted me.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.510
Nikita.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.637
-You have to get Amanda.
-She's gone.

35:46.853 --> 35:50.220
-The black box? Can you track it?
-Amanda's going to have to wait.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.056
-Division?
-We need to get back.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.947
-You might live to regret that, Sam.
-You may not live, period.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.696
I went through hell to get this back.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.748
Now it's your time to deliver.

36:11.544 --> 36:14.672
I want the names of the contacts
we can sell these secrets to.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.754
I want my money.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.457
And then I never want to see
any of your faces again.

36:20.345 --> 36:24.133
-You're a man who seems to know--
-Hey. Shut up and drive.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.075
Okay.

36:54.421 --> 36:58.585
-Sean, are you Okay?
-Yeah. I'm good.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.796
Let me catch my breath.
I think I cracked a rib.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.925
-You need to go to Medical.
-Are there any Medics left?

37:06.141 --> 37:08.678
One. She's looking after Ryan.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.894
Sean, there's something
I have to tell you...

37:17.986 --> 37:19.772
...about Ryan.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.025
You're the one who shot him.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.492
How did you know?

37:29.414 --> 37:33.157
When I mentioned his name
in the storage room, your reaction.

37:33.376 --> 37:38.666
That's when I became certain you were not
the Alex I know.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.168
I didn't mean to Shoot him.

37:41.885 --> 37:46.595
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I swear, I didn't.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.138
Sean, you have to believe me.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.893
-The thing that matters to me the most--
-ls saving everyone, I know.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.845
No, you don't know.

37:56.399 --> 37:59.186
I couldn't save my father.

37:59.527 --> 38:03.645
I couldn't save Larissa, I couldn't save
those girls I left behind in the brothel.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.605
What's done is done.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.861
| just want my girl back.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.989
Now help me get to Medical.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.625
One thing good.

38:21.841 --> 38:25.208
I can finally use that big-screen to watch
some Monday night football.

38:25.428 --> 38:28.966
Sean.Sean.

38:31.142 --> 38:36.136
You got shot. Somebody help!

38:40.652 --> 38:44.645
I can't find the exit wound,
where's the blood?

38:45.156 --> 38:47.898
-Must be internal bleeding.
-What?

38:48.117 --> 38:49.698
I've seen this before.

38:49.911 --> 38:53.324
Bullet gets lodged in there, nicks a major
artery. Nothing you can do.

38:53.540 --> 38:59.331
-No!
-Promise me you'll find a way to get better.

38:59.796 --> 39:04.381
Don't think about that now.
Please, please, somebody help!

39:04.926 --> 39:11.422
-Alex, Alex, just promise me....
-I promise.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.883
Hey,Sean?

39:15.478 --> 39:17.434
You were wrong before...

39:17.647 --> 39:20.980
...when you said the thing that matters
to me most is saving everyone.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.693
You were wrong.

39:22.902 --> 39:26.065
What I was trying to say is the thing
that matters to me most...

39:26.447 --> 39:28.153
...is you.

39:31.411 --> 39:35.404
Hey, this is where we first met.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.581
Hey.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.600
No!

40:29.761 --> 40:33.879
-What happened?
-ls there anyone left?

40:34.223 --> 40:36.350
A dozen or so.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.179
You guys need to get to Ops.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.290
This was Rachel's doing?

41:10.677 --> 41:13.840
He bled out internally.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.713
Where's Alex?

41:16.933 --> 41:20.346
She said she was gonna stay.
She was waiting for you...

41:21.813 --> 41:25.101
...and then we found Sean here.
She was gone.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.107
Kept saying She was trying to save
everyone.

41:29.570 --> 41:32.186
I guess in the end, She couldn't save him.

41:36.744 --> 41:39.486
Not everyone can be saved.

42:28.337 --> 42:30.328
