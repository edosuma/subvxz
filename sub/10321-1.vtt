So, she makes
her money in turnover.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.406
- How'd it go?
- He gave me $10
to help baby monkeys.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.609
How was the sex?
You got anything in the tank
left over for me?

12:56.643 --> 12:57.777
We didn't do it.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.548
Damn it, Patty.
I'm on a schedule here.
Come on, Randy.

13:01.581 --> 13:07.120
I tried, Earl. I did.
Towards the end I even
pulled out my good boob.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.124
You think he's
gonna remember you?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.795
- [ Whimpers ]
- Yeah, I think he remembers me.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.934
[ Beeping ]

13:20.968 --> 13:25.572
- Kenny, calm down.
- I have a restraining order
against you, Earl Hickey.

13:25.605 --> 13:29.009
But that was written
on a brown paper bag by
the school nurse 20 years ago.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.744
Yeah, well, just take
what you want and leave.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.380
All I wanna do is talk.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.749
Listen, Kenny.
I'm here to help you.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.952
I don't need your help.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.989
Buddy, you just gave up
a chance to have free sex
with a daytime hooker.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.024
- You need my help.
- Earl?

13:44.057 --> 13:46.793
- Not now, Randy.
- Shut that drawer!

13:46.826 --> 13:50.763
Kenny, I'm here
to help you find a woman
so that you can be happy.

13:50.797 --> 13:56.103
Earl, I think you're tryin'
to sell a cat to a man
who fancies dogs.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.952
[ Earl Narrating ]
I know this might sound crazy
in this day and age,

14:11.985 --> 14:16.924
but we live in a small town,
and I've never been
face-to-face with a gay before.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.195
I understand now the runnin'
probably wasn't necessary.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.102
That's it.
Kenny's off the list.
Good.

14:29.136 --> 14:33.173
Isn't that against the rules?
Look, I made the list.
That means I make the rules.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.076
The guy was gay. Gay.
That's special circumstances.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.878
I don't have to help if
there's special circumstances.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.714
Here. Get us
a couple of cheeseburgers
from the machine.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.317
Okay. So, what's next?

14:44.351 --> 14:48.588
Number 86-- stole a car
from a one-legged girl.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.061
What happened here?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.065
Ow! Damn, girl!
Have you lost your mind?

14:58.098 --> 15:00.600
- Who's the whore?
- What did you just call me?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.603
- She's the maid. Relax.
- Did you think
I wasn't gonna find out?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.842
Damn. Look at that.
My eyes are closed.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.644
I want half
that lotto money, Earl.

15:11.678 --> 15:15.382
I wanted a legitimate baby
and a wife who didn't
huff paint on Thanksgivin',

15:15.415 --> 15:18.285
but I guess life's full
of little disappointments,
now ain't it?

15:18.318 --> 15:21.421
They only had one
Mello Yello left.
You wanna wrestle for it?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.823
[ Groans ]

15:23.856 --> 15:26.593
That's it!
Gimme the damn phone!

15:26.626 --> 15:31.631
I'm gonna get that money, Earl!
I want it.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.605
[ Catalina ]
That's your ex-wife?
Yep.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.841
As crazy as she is,
I'd be lyin' if I said
I wasn't gonna miss her.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.545
[ Grunts ]
[ Alarm Beeping ]

15:45.578 --> 15:48.381
[ Alarm Beeps, Stops ]

15:48.415 --> 15:51.118
- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, Crab Man.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.487
What happened?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.691
Karma.
Karma happened.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.964
[ Earl Narrating ]
And I believed it too.
Think about it.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.134
As soon as I decided
not to help Kenny,

16:07.167 --> 16:10.503
Joy broke into my room
and beat me up with a phone.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.173
That's when I realized
I have to stick to the plan.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.575
There are
no special circumstances.

16:15.608 --> 16:19.179
I may have made the list,
but I do not make the rules.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.348
Karma makes the rules.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.418
The one-legged girl
would have to wait.
Kenny had to be first.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.793
Stay away. I bought Mace.
I just want to talk,
Kenny. Relax.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.930
[ Screaming ]
Ow!

16:37.964 --> 16:40.867
Kenny?

16:40.900 --> 16:44.337
Hey, Kenny.
How's it feelin' now?

16:44.371 --> 16:48.308
Better, yeah.
Thanks for pinning me
down on the ground,

16:48.341 --> 16:50.943
prying my eyes open
and pouring the milk in.

16:50.977 --> 16:55.748
- I think that helped a lot.
- You steal enough purses, you
learn a few things about Mace.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.717
Mm-hmm.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.820
Why--
[ Clears Throat ]

17:00.853 --> 17:03.123
God, wow. That's--
[ Chuckles ]

17:03.156 --> 17:06.426
Why don't you have
a man, Kenny?

17:06.459 --> 17:08.261
What?

17:08.295 --> 17:11.831
If you like... men,

17:11.864 --> 17:14.501
why don't you, uh,
have a man?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.104
That's none
of your business.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.038
No, it's not.
I know that.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.642
Trust me, I don't
really wanna know.
It's just you seem lonely.

17:22.675 --> 17:27.114
And I gotta figure out how
I'm gonna help you so I can
cross you off my list.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.249
What list?

17:29.282 --> 17:32.719
You're number 64.
But don't let that fool you.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.654
I'm doin' you first.

17:36.223 --> 17:40.493
You see, Kenny,
my life sucks.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.196
And it's because
I've been a bad person.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.432
I'm hopin' if I can
do some good things,

17:45.465 --> 17:48.168
then maybe some good things
might finally happen to me.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.603
You're talking about karma.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.340
You're a Carson Daly
fan too, huh?

17:53.373 --> 17:56.443
Yeah, I'm talkin'
about karma.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.580
You're really trying
to change?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.849
If I don't, I think
life's gonna kill me.

18:04.884 --> 18:09.021
I don't have a man because...
nobody knows I'm gay.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.791
You know what this town
is like, Earl.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.794
Besides, even if people knew,
where am I gonna meet anyone?

18:14.827 --> 18:18.398
What about the city?
Don't they have special bars
for the queers?

18:18.431 --> 18:23.035
I'm sorry.
Uh, Homosexual-Americans.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.071
I tried that once.

18:25.104 --> 18:30.109
I drove an hour and a half
just to sit out front
in my car, too scared to go in.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.114
[ Clears Throat ]

18:35.148 --> 18:37.684
What if I went with you?
[ Grunts ]

18:37.717 --> 18:42.455
- What?
- Maybe you won't be scared
if you're not alone.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.859
Earl Hickey is going
to take me to a gay bar?

18:47.394 --> 18:50.363
I don't have
a choice, Kenny.

18:50.397 --> 18:53.200
[ Men Chattering ]

18:55.968 --> 18:58.471
[ Earl Narrating ]
I didn't wanna be
the only non-gay there,

18:58.505 --> 19:03.243
so luckily, Randy agreed
to go as soon as he heard
there were gonna be bubbles.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.347
You like that one?

19:07.380 --> 19:10.383
Uh, I don't--
I don't know.
He's cute, I guess.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.885
All right.
I'll go talk to him.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.588
You wanna be the man
or the woman?

19:15.622 --> 19:18.391
Wait. You're just gonna
go over there and talk to him?

19:18.425 --> 19:22.629
Yeah. He's gay,
but he ain't gonna bite me.
He ain't gonna bite me, is he?

19:22.662 --> 19:26.699
Look, maybe I should
do this myself.
I can't let you do that.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.602
I gotta be the one
to help you if I wanna
cross you off my list.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.939
Wait, wait, wait.
You have helped me.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.642
Look, my whole life
I've been scared to be
who I really am...

19:35.675 --> 19:38.345
because of what people
might think.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.013
But then Earl Hickey
brought me to a gay bar.

19:41.047 --> 19:46.152
Earl Hickey
went to Express for Men
and bought me a shirt.

19:46.185 --> 19:50.257
Earl Hickey, the one man
I was the most scared of
in my whole life,

19:50.290 --> 19:52.525
has accepted me as I am.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.597
Look, when we were kids,
you took away my confidence.

19:57.630 --> 20:02.402
But today you gave it back.
Thanks, Earl.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.676
You can cross me off
your list.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.248
[ Earl Narrating ]
And there you have it.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.984
Never underestimate
the power of confidence.

20:18.017 --> 20:22.221
It's midnight, boys.
And that means it's time
to take it old school.

20:26.993 --> 20:31.331
Oh, no, you didn't.
Tell me you didn't
just go old school!

20:41.173 --> 20:43.610
[ Earl Narrating ]
And never underestimate
15 beers,

20:43.643 --> 20:46.446
a little enlightenment...

20:46.479 --> 20:49.449
and the power of
Rob Base and DJ EZ Rock.

20:51.418 --> 20:55.422
Well, one down,
258 to go.
