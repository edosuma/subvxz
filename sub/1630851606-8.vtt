["Raspberry Jam" by Allah-Las playing]

00:13.430 --> 00:16.182
[indistinct chattering]

00:16.266 --> 00:18.727
-[Pope] That was epic.
-[John B] Did you guys see Kelce's face?

00:18.810 --> 00:21.229
-[JJ] Bomb drop! [grunts]
-[basketball rim shaking]

00:21.312 --> 00:23.690
-[John B] Another broken couch.
-[Pope] You gotta sleep there.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.066
[JJ] I always sleep there. Hey.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.902
-Well, hello, princess.
-[Kie] What's up?

00:27.986 --> 00:31.448
Shouldn't you be on Figure Eight
with your little group of polo players?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.826
Or did you break up with Topper?

00:34.909 --> 00:36.077
We're just friends.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.705
He's just a friend.
You have a lot of friends, Sarah Cameron.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.166
Yeah, and it seems
like you've got some of your own too.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.252
-All right, what are you doing here?
-[Sarah sighs] I'm here for Pope.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.589
I think I found the island room.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.883
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

00:57.265 --> 00:59.059
Guys, listen to this.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.897
The diary says the cross holds
the most holy relic in all of Christendom,

01:03.980 --> 01:05.273
the Garment of the Savior.

01:05.356 --> 01:09.069
[Kie] So wait, he saying
there's a holy garment inside the cross?

01:09.152 --> 01:13.698
Yeah. It says the garment is capable
of healing the sick from any malady.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.369
Mmm, yeah. "If only I may touch
His garment, I shall be made well."

01:20.663 --> 01:22.499
What? I went to Sunday school.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.416
[Kie] Sure.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.252
Well, that explains
why Limbrey would want the cross so bad.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.712
She thinks it can heal her.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.048
[Kie] What else does it say?

01:30.131 --> 01:32.717
"Many feel that we have sinned
to steal such a sacred thing,

01:32.801 --> 01:34.844
and God will strike His vengeance on us."

01:34.928 --> 01:37.639
Thing is, God did have His vengeance.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.350
He sent a hurricane to sink the ship.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.018
Only Denmark survived.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.040
-[JJ] Whoo!
-[John B] This place still freaks me out.

02:04.124 --> 02:04.958
[JJ] Yeah, same.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.045
Pope, look.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.802
[Pope] Whoa! You've got to be kidding me.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.972
[Sarah] Yeah.
I know, right? It's the island room.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.184
-Incredible.
-[Sarah] It's been here this whole time.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.853
[John B] No freaking way.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.813
-This definitely means something.
-Wow.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.648
-[John B] Jeez.
-[JJ] Dang!

02:29.566 --> 02:30.984
[John B] This is incredible.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.195
Yo, this is a map of the whole island.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.991
[JJ] Yeah, John B, I think you're right
because this is Rixon's right here.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.660
And then, there's the lighthouse.

02:40.743 --> 02:44.122
[Kie] Guys, look, Parcel 9 and the well.

02:44.706 --> 02:48.751
So, if that's Parcel 9,
and then if that's Rixon's,

02:48.835 --> 02:50.795
then that's gotta be
the surf break at Mase.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.005
Right. And look.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.592
Pope, come here.
This is Denmark's handwriting for sure.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.052
[Pope] The drawings, they match up.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.512
Holy shit.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.015
Denmark, you genius!

03:02.098 --> 03:05.727
These are all his drawings.
He… he painted this entire room.

03:05.810 --> 03:09.230
[Kie] Yeah, question is why.
What's he trying to tell us?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.858
[JJ] It's gotta have something
to do with the key, right? Right?

03:11.941 --> 03:13.568
[Kie] Yeah, but what?

03:13.651 --> 03:16.529
-How did you know to uncover this?
-I didn't.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.865
-It was like this when I got home.
-[JJ] What?

03:18.948 --> 03:20.909
[Kie] Okay, then who did it?

03:20.992 --> 03:22.035
I don't know.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.703
-[Wheezie] The freaks.
-[group gasps]

03:24.621 --> 03:25.705
Wheeze!

03:25.788 --> 03:29.876
-What freaks are we talking about, Wheeze?
-Uh… that sick lady and her attack dog.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.545
They… they showed up last night,
and they wanted to talk to Rafe.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.172
-Okay.
-Wait. Pale blond lady?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.924
-[Kie] She have crutches?
-Uh-huh.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.675
-It's gotta be Limbrey.
-Wh… what happened?

03:37.759 --> 03:40.011
First, they searched the whole house
looking for something,

03:40.094 --> 03:41.763
and then Rafe told me to go upstairs.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.641
But I didn't wanna miss out,
so I listened through the grate.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.977
[Rafe] We looked all over the house.
This is the last room to check out.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.104
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

03:51.314 --> 03:52.482
Well, look.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.611
Is this what you were talking about?

03:57.153 --> 03:57.987
[sighs]

04:01.824 --> 04:02.659
[gasps]

04:03.952 --> 04:06.162
Yes! That's it! That's it! That's it!

04:07.247 --> 04:10.375
This is it. All right,
let's get the rest of this wallpaper off.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.126
[laughing]

04:12.210 --> 04:13.419
[Renfield] Holy shit.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.755
-[Limbrey] Work on the other wall.
-All right.

04:16.881 --> 04:19.509
[Limbrey gasps] Yes!

04:21.678 --> 04:22.595
It's a church.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.264
[sighs]

04:24.347 --> 04:27.600
[Limbrey] We found it.
We finally found it.

04:28.226 --> 04:32.272
And they were talking
about getting across the sand flamingo.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.690
That's code for something.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.234
The cross. The Cross of Santo Domingo?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.653
Yeah, that's it.
Oh, and they were talking about angels.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.239
-A lot of angel talk. I don't know.
-[John B] Angels?

04:41.322 --> 04:43.408
Guys, Denmark's famous last words.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.660
He buried the real treasure
at the foot of the angel.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.579
They're looking for an angel.
We have to find the angel in the room.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.998
-Start looking.
-[Kie] Spread out.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.458
-There's a church over here.
-Yeah, check the church.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.585
-[Pope] Looking for an angel.
-Could this be an angel?

04:54.669 --> 04:55.712
Maybe… maybe…

04:55.795 --> 04:58.172
What's… what's going on?
Are you guys gonna tell me?

04:58.256 --> 05:01.384
-[Pope] The lighthouse maybe?
-[Kie] Maybe it's heat-sensitive.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.303
[group speaking indistinctly]

05:04.971 --> 05:06.097
[Pope] There's a cemetery…

05:06.180 --> 05:07.307
[Kie] Yeah, because--

05:07.390 --> 05:09.851
It's still there. Hey, yo!
Hey, guys, I think I found something.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.687
Come here. This humongous tree
is still on Goat Island.

05:12.770 --> 05:13.813
You know what it's called?

05:14.605 --> 05:15.523
Angel Oak.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.443
-[JJ] Look there. There's the keyhole.
-Wait.

05:18.526 --> 05:23.197
That means the cross is buried
at the foot of the angel.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.743
Wow, that must be where he put it.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.911
That must be where they are right now!
We have to go!

05:28.995 --> 05:31.539
I think I'm Sherlock Holmes, all right?
You're welcome by the way.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.166
[John B] Yeah. Hurry up, Sherlock.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.918
[upbeat rock music playing]

05:36.002 --> 05:38.046
[Pope] Guys,
we're coming up on Freedman's Church.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.881
The church Denmark built
for all the slaves he freed.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.429
[Kie] There it is, Angel Oak.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.268
[John B] Oh, shit! Tide's coming in.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.231
-Um…
-[Pope] Hey, wait a second. Look.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.524
They already came through here.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.486
Those have to be Limbrey's tire tracks.
Guys, we gotta go.

06:01.569 --> 06:05.114
-[JJ] Mmm, what do you think, chief?
-I'm thinking it's looking a little dicey.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.200
Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree
with that statement.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.035
-Yeah.
-[Kie] Okay, clearly, they made it. No?

06:09.118 --> 06:11.079
[JJ] In a two-wheel drive?
I don't know about that.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.831
Why are y'all acting
like you're not gonna do it anyways?

06:13.915 --> 06:16.542
Like when have
y'all ever done the safe thing?

06:18.169 --> 06:20.171
-She's got a point.
-Speed is your friend here, okay?

06:20.254 --> 06:22.882
So, put her down in second
and hammer down, brother.

06:22.965 --> 06:26.302
-[Pope] Stick to the ground in the middle.
-All right, ready? Here we go.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.429
-[rock music playing]
-[JJ] Come on. Punch it.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.015
Speed is your friend.
You're not going fast enough.

06:31.099 --> 06:31.933
I'm in second.

06:32.016 --> 06:32.934
It's gonna slide.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.478
-You're fishtailing already.
-I know.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.438
[Pope] Not to put
any more pressure on you,

06:37.522 --> 06:39.982
but if you don't make it through,
we'll be stuck here forever.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.067
Put your head back, okay?

06:41.651 --> 06:42.944
[group cheers]

06:43.027 --> 06:45.321
-[John B] I told you we'd make it.
-[JJ] That's my girl.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.031
[JJ] All right, right here. That's good.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.325
Angel Oak is right through here.

06:49.992 --> 06:52.328
All right, so word to the wise,

06:52.995 --> 06:54.664
definitely know
that gators nest back here,

06:54.747 --> 06:56.666
so keep your eyes peeled, okay?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.377
You don't wanna step on a mama gator.
That's the last thing you want.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.378
They have nests?

07:00.461 --> 07:02.171
[Sarah] Seems like a good place to park.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.674
[JJ] All right.
You don't wanna be a Pat Womack.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.885
She had her calf chewed off by a gator,
right? You know that, right?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.637
That's actually not true.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.015
Pat Womack was injured
in a car accident, but I hear you.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.434
Okay, just live in ignorance.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.479
But like, she had her calf chewed off
by a mama gator. I know that for a fact.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.064
They like the brackish water.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.525
-Wait. Hold on. I see something.
-[Kie] What are you doing?

07:23.734 --> 07:25.695
Right. Wake them up. That's smart.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.823
I was just making sure it wasn't a gator.
That's all, all right?

07:29.866 --> 07:31.993
Okay, I just wanna make this
crystal clear

07:32.076 --> 07:34.579
so you don't lose your shit
and cause another riot.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.247
I am here for Pope and not you.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.832
-You're here for Pope and not me?
-Yeah.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.833
-That the case?
-Mm-hmm.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.377
Then why are you back here
walking with me, huh, Sarah Cameron?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.671
-[Sarah] I don't know. Why am I?
-Seriously?

07:44.714 --> 07:47.049
-[men speaking indistinctly]
-[whispers] Hey. [shushes]

07:47.133 --> 07:48.468
[engine revving]

07:49.343 --> 07:50.636
[Rafe] I don't see shit.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.640
-You sure this is the right spot?
-[whispers] Hey. [shushes]

07:54.724 --> 07:56.017
[dramatic music playing]

07:56.100 --> 07:58.728
[Limbrey] It's there.
The garment will be in the cross,

07:58.811 --> 08:01.063
and the cross will be
at the foot of the tree.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.107
[Renfield] Well,
whatever we find, I get my cut.

08:03.691 --> 08:07.987
The actual garment.
You understand the significance.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.114
I do, Carla. Completely.

08:10.198 --> 08:16.204
One touch of it, and I'll be healed,
and this long nightmare will be over.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.498
Your lips to God's ears.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.124
[Limbrey] I know you don't believe it,

08:20.208 --> 08:23.127
but countless stories
over millennia prove that…

08:23.211 --> 08:24.128
[grunts]

08:25.379 --> 08:26.297
[sighs]

08:27.256 --> 08:28.132
[chuckles]

08:28.674 --> 08:30.134
…miracles happen.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.555
-[wood crunching]
-Hey! Wait!

08:34.639 --> 08:37.433
Stop! Stop. Please stop. Did you hear it?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.810
Hey, get in there, boys. Do it by hand.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.772
Oh. This has gotta be the cross.

08:43.981 --> 08:44.815
[gasps]

08:45.399 --> 08:47.026
It's smaller than I thought. [chuckles]

08:47.109 --> 08:48.736
-It looks like a--
-Casket.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.200
He put it in a casket. [chuckles]

08:54.283 --> 08:57.078
-Denmark put it in a casket. Get it up.
-Let's go.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.708
-[Rafe] Here. Come on.
-[Renfield and Rafe grunting]

09:05.378 --> 09:08.130
They got the cross?
What do we do? What do we do?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.131
What can we do?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.217
[Renfield and Rafe panting]

09:12.176 --> 09:13.553
[Limbrey] Be careful.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.390
Don't touch anything inside!
Don't touch anything inside!

09:17.473 --> 09:19.350
[Renfield and Rafe grunting]

09:23.354 --> 09:25.231
[jarring instrumental music plays]

09:26.566 --> 09:28.609
-[Limbrey sighs]
-[Renfield] It's just a corpse.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.987
Sorry, Carla.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.824
-[sighs]
-[Limbrey grunting]

09:37.159 --> 09:39.120
We must have missed something.

09:39.203 --> 09:42.665
[Rafe] Of course. Of course, yeah.
Of course it's just a dead body. Jesus!

09:44.292 --> 09:45.585
[panting]

09:48.462 --> 09:50.381
[Limbrey] We just got the wrong place.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.383
We'll go back to the island room.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.344
We're going back!
We're going back! It's not over!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.848
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

10:14.113 --> 10:16.699
Pope. Pope, wait. Wait! Shit.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.745
-[all panting]
-[JJ] Wait, wait. Yo.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.924
[Pope] Cecilia Tanny, Denmark's wife.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.309
He wasn't talking about the cross.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.394
He buried her at the foot of the angel.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.313
The true treasure.

John B! Hold on!

23:54.099 --> 23:55.225
Sarah, what's happening?

23:55.308 --> 23:57.227
[panting]

23:57.310 --> 23:59.563
-Pope, hurry!
-John B! Hey!

23:59.646 --> 24:01.398
Pope, a gator has him!

24:01.481 --> 24:03.442
[panting]

24:04.359 --> 24:05.944
[whimpers]

24:06.445 --> 24:08.738
-John B.
-[screams]

24:08.822 --> 24:09.823
John B!

24:11.533 --> 24:13.743
[Sarah grunting]

24:26.047 --> 24:27.632
You okay, man? Holy shit!

24:27.716 --> 24:29.009
[group panting]

24:31.386 --> 24:32.804
-[Pope] Come on.
-[Sarah] Let's go.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.347
[group panting, coughing]

24:34.431 --> 24:36.308
-Go!
-[Pope] Get to the Twinkie, now!

24:46.109 --> 24:49.237
Hey, why don't you tell your mom hi?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.322
[JJ] Shut up.

24:50.947 --> 24:51.823
Make it quick.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.868
-Come on.
-[door closes]

24:55.619 --> 24:56.453
[Kie] Hey, Luke.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.415
[JJ] Go. Go!

25:09.925 --> 25:13.261
Did you have to do that?
Did you have to go after her like that?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.515
-I told her the truth. She didn't like it.
-Everything, hmm.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.684
Everything I have, you fricking ruin.

25:20.894 --> 25:24.022
I don't try to. Just happens naturally.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.573
[engine sputters, starts]

25:36.159 --> 25:37.827
You got a full tank of gas…

25:40.872 --> 25:43.625
but I reckon
that's only gonna get you to Jacksonville.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.171
-You got money for gas, right?
-[Luke] What do you think?

25:48.255 --> 25:50.006
Yeah, no. I'll figure it out.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.599
[JJ] Dad.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.935
[somber instrumental music playing]

26:06.815 --> 26:08.358
Hey. Come here, Son. Come here.

26:11.444 --> 26:15.490
-I know I could've been better.
-I hadn't exactly been perfect either.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.243
Well, hey, perfect don't matter.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.287
You got a good heart.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.836
No, no. Come on.
Can't let it end like this.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.463
I'm going to Yucatán.
I might never be coming back.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.090
It'll all work out.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.303
[whimpering] No, it's not.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.472
But maybe in the next life.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.560
[Luke] Come on, J. Don't be like that.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.190
[emotional music playing]

26:49.899 --> 26:50.984
[JJ sighs]

26:54.195 --> 26:57.073
[sniffles] Take care, Dad, okay?

27:15.759 --> 27:16.635
[sighs]

27:28.855 --> 27:29.731
[sniffles]

27:53.296 --> 27:54.172
[sniffles]

28:05.016 --> 28:06.726
[Limbrey] Where's the cross, Denmark?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.853
[inhales deeply] Come on. Come on.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.564
[gasps, grunts]

28:12.899 --> 28:15.694
She really believe
that shit about the magic bathrobe?

28:16.486 --> 28:20.031
Full-on. She got nothing else
to believe in. Why not that?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.075
But the cross, that exists, yeah?

28:24.327 --> 28:26.788
Did at some point.
That's a historical fact.

28:27.789 --> 28:28.873
And it's valuable?

28:29.999 --> 28:34.754
It's seven feet high, plated in gold,
and full of diamonds. You tell me.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.631
-[vehicle approaching]
-I was just asking.

28:38.466 --> 28:39.426
Shit.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.302
[vehicle door opens]

28:44.264 --> 28:49.185
Hey, Rafe. Got no beef, man.
I'm, uh… I'm just here to meet Sarah.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.314
Sarah's not here.
Go… go chase her somewhere else.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.984
What do you mean, Sarah's not here?
I talked with her earlier.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.069
Supposed to meet her here,
supposed to pick her up.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.821
How would I know where my sister is, huh?

29:00.947 --> 29:03.074
And one thing you should know, Top, is…

29:03.158 --> 29:07.120
is I got nothing against you, even though
you totally punked me the other night.

29:07.203 --> 29:10.248
Really? Uh…
Were… were you too coked-out

29:10.331 --> 29:13.042
to remember the fact
that you were drowning your sister?

29:13.126 --> 29:15.462
Drowning? I wasn't--
No. I wasn't drowning her.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.881
-I was provoked, all right?
-All right, man. You know what?

29:17.964 --> 29:20.550
You think…
you think I want her with John B? Huh?

29:21.926 --> 29:23.428
Is that what you really think?

29:24.721 --> 29:26.598
Is that where she is? Is she with John B?

29:27.098 --> 29:31.895
Where the hell else would she be? Huh?
Unless she found some other sucker. Yeah?

29:33.313 --> 29:36.149
I can just track her. I completely forgot.
I can just track her phone.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.401
-Are you spying on her?
-No, I'm not spying on her.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.237
Rafe, I just care about her.
I want to make sure she's safe.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.325
-Can I see that? Oh, yeah.
-Jeez.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.576
Give… give me my phone back.

29:46.659 --> 29:49.621
What? Calm down, all right?

29:49.704 --> 29:52.081
What the hell
is she doing out on Goat Island?

29:54.584 --> 29:55.835
Shit.

29:57.420 --> 29:58.630
-[Topper] What?
-Of course.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.633
-Rafe!
-Go home.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.344
Trust me.
You do not wanna be near her right now.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.763
Hey, Renfield, I got something. Let's go.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.435
-[menacing instrumental music playing]
-[John B gasps]

30:12.519 --> 30:14.562
[Pope] Careful.
I'm pretty sure that'll get infected.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.064
Yeah! [gasping]

30:16.147 --> 30:19.067
Yeah, you're lucky.
It didn't cut into muscle too much.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.278
[panting] Lucky I got bit by an alligator

30:22.362 --> 30:24.864
and my car is underwater.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.033
Do you have something to wrap it with,

30:27.116 --> 30:29.118
stop the bleeding? It can…

30:36.751 --> 30:39.128
[Pope] Oh,
and speak of the fricking devil.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.840
-[horn honks]
-Look who it is,

30:41.923 --> 30:45.343
the tortoise and the tortoise.
Just a couple hours late.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.428
Where the hell were you guys?

30:48.096 --> 30:49.973
Paternal complications.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.474
Luke was at the Chateau.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.644
[Pope] Oh, great! While you were having
family time with your pops,

30:54.727 --> 30:56.145
John B got bit by a gator.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.189
-Like, for real?
-Does it look like we're joking?

30:58.273 --> 30:59.983
Okay, what the hell happened?

31:00.066 --> 31:02.485
-What happened? I got bit by a gator!
-He got bit by a gator!

31:02.569 --> 31:04.904
I dunno why I'm being yelled at.
I put my ass on the line.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.031
You're being yelled at
because it was 20 minutes--

31:07.115 --> 31:11.202
-We got here as fast as we could.
-[group yelling indistinctly]

31:11.286 --> 31:12.537
Shut up!

31:16.165 --> 31:18.793
Seriously, guys,
I can't take it anymore, all right?

31:21.129 --> 31:24.799
Everyone just cut it out for a second.
[laughs]

31:26.843 --> 31:32.724
Look, I just helped my dad
leave this island for good.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.726
Like, he's not ever coming back.

31:34.809 --> 31:37.520
He's straight up like the Spanish.
Just, "Bon voyage."

31:39.689 --> 31:41.274
That's not the right language.

31:41.357 --> 31:42.567
All we got…

31:43.985 --> 31:48.781
And I know for a fact all I got
is you guys, okay? You're it.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.747
And I've come too close to losing you,
all of you.

31:55.830 --> 31:59.334
I mean, shit, like you almost drowned.
Pope, you were kidnapped.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.377
Sarah, you've been shot.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.047
John B, you were almost dinner
for a freaking gator, bro.

32:04.130 --> 32:07.508
So, this blaming each other
is some Kook-ass bullshit, all right?

32:08.885 --> 32:10.011
We don't do that.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.763
Okay? We're Pogues.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.059
Sorry, that was a lot right now.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.186
I didn't mean to…

32:20.647 --> 32:22.565
Yeah. All right.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.275
-[Pope] Well-done.
-I gotta be honest.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.486
That was the best freaking speech
you have ever given.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.072
Also, you should think about,
like, a Rosetta Stone

32:29.155 --> 32:31.741
because your Spanish and French
are flip-flopped.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.035
We should bon voyage out of here.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.621
All right, let's get
this damn Twinkie out of here.

32:36.704 --> 32:39.916
Keep it coming.
Keep her coming. She's almost out.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.168
Keep it going. Easy! Easy! Easy!

32:42.251 --> 32:43.503
Sarah, to the right.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.129
-Straighten out.
-[Sarah] I am!

32:46.255 --> 32:48.758
-Whoo! The Twinkie lives!
-[Sarah] Whoo!

32:48.841 --> 32:51.928
[JJ] The Twinkie lives! Let's go, boy!

32:52.011 --> 32:53.179
[Sarah laughing]

32:56.307 --> 32:58.309
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

33:03.398 --> 33:05.233
[birds fluttering]

33:08.444 --> 33:12.699
Okay, you're telling me Denmark Tanny
decided to hide the cross here?

33:12.782 --> 33:15.243
-[Pope] Mm-hmm.
-[Kie] Everybody, just spread out.

33:15.743 --> 33:19.831
[John B] Okay, well, if I was a cross
and wanted to be hidden in an old church,

33:19.914 --> 33:20.999
where would I hide?

33:21.082 --> 33:23.376
Are you sure
that Denmark hid the cross here, Pope?

33:23.459 --> 33:26.379
-Like, are we at the right church?
-It's gotta be here somewhere, guys.

33:26.963 --> 33:31.759
What if we have to push a secret button
or, like, play, like, a… a certain chord,

33:31.843 --> 33:34.137
and then, all of a sudden,
the ground beneath us reveals

33:34.220 --> 33:37.140
the catacombs or something
on which we stand?

33:37.223 --> 33:39.559
[John B] How about
we try to find obvious clues?

33:39.642 --> 33:40.768
It's not an escape room.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.312
-[Pope] It's gotta be in here.
-[JJ softly] Sorry. I'm sorry.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.731
[gasps] Come on.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.025
[John B] I can't see
where they'd hide a giant cross here.

33:47.108 --> 33:50.611
No, no. There's no way he would set us up
on a freaking goose chase

33:50.695 --> 33:52.697
that would lead us
to a church that has nothing.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.241
Yes, I get it.
I don't know what to tell you, man.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.870
[Pope] The clues led us here.
The cross is in this church.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.749
[John B] Pope, it'll be all right.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.543
We've had setbacks in the past,
and we figured it out.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.920
-We're gonna find it.
-He's right.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.467
[John B] We've just gotta think
about this logically, all right?

34:12.550 --> 34:15.678
Where else would you hide
a seven-foot-tall cross made of gold?

34:20.183 --> 34:21.225
What?

34:31.736 --> 34:33.946
[inspirational instrumental music playing]

34:35.156 --> 34:37.700
[Kie] Oh my God! Look at that.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.289
[gasping]

34:43.790 --> 34:44.624
Pope.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.543
-[JJ] Hey, no!
-[John B] Now Pope's climbing the wall.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.172
-Wait. Pope, wait. This is crazy.
-[Kie] Pope, this church is old.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.008
-[JJ] I'm just gonna--
-Like really old. This isn't safe.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.218
[crumbling]

34:55.301 --> 34:58.179
[JJ] Yo! This church gots to be
at least 200 years old.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.972
[John B] He's right. It's too dangerous.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.432
[JJ] Yo, let me just be real.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.893
You're not the most coordinated person
on planet Earth.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.229
-[Kie] Pope? Pope!
-[JJ] You hear me? What are you doing?

35:06.312 --> 35:08.523
All right, this one's solid wood.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.733
I'm gonna try the other beam.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.820
[JJ] Pope, that's rotten as shit
right there, okay?

35:14.487 --> 35:16.072
-[grunts]
-[Kie] Hey, easy!

35:16.155 --> 35:18.574
Pope, I hate to break it to you,
but that's wood.

35:18.658 --> 35:22.829
No, no. [grunts]
It has to be here. I know it.

35:22.912 --> 35:23.913
[JJ] Bro, just look out

35:23.996 --> 35:25.915
for that giant wasp nest
right above your head.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.708
-[Sarah] Yeah.
-[wasps buzzing]

35:28.835 --> 35:32.463
Hey, just… just move slow, all right?
Nice and easy, all right?

35:37.176 --> 35:39.095
-Whoa, hey! Yo!
-[Sarah] God!

35:42.014 --> 35:42.932
[Pope] Look!

35:44.225 --> 35:45.309
It's hollow.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.770
-Go get me a crowbar!
-What are you gonna do, Pope?

35:47.854 --> 35:50.690
I don't want this entire church
to collapse on top of us.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.691
That's all I'm saying.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.823
[dramatic music playing]

-[leaves rustle]

36:21.387 --> 36:22.221
[Pope] Sarah!

36:22.305 --> 36:24.140
Hey. Pope.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.766
-Throw it.
-[Sarah] Okay.

36:25.850 --> 36:26.684
Oh, for real?

36:26.767 --> 36:28.352
-[John B] Watch your heads.
-[JJ] Wait.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.520
Ah.

36:29.604 --> 36:30.438
Got it!

36:30.521 --> 36:32.648
-[chuckles]
-[Kie] Not bad.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.611
Hey, Pope, Pope, there's the wasp nest
right up there, okay?

36:36.694 --> 36:39.280
-Just move slow, all right?
-Got it.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.535
[grunting]

36:45.620 --> 36:46.454
Hey, uh…

36:53.169 --> 36:54.170
What is that?

36:55.338 --> 36:56.589
Do you guys see that?

36:57.632 --> 36:58.466
[Kie] Shit.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.472
[gasps]

37:05.181 --> 37:06.849
-[gasps]
-Holy shit.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.393
[Sarah] It's here. Oh my God.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.897
-You did it, buddy.
-[Sarah] What is that?

37:13.898 --> 37:15.358
[group laughing, chattering]
