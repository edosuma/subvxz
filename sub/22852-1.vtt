"Just be quiet, ma'am."

know where I'm going."

04:12.300 --> 04:14.077

knew where he was going.

04:14.078 --> 04:16.334
He drove around in a circle
for at least an hour,

04:16.334 --> 04:18.685
and of course, I did not pay for that,

04:18.685 --> 04:20.848
so when we got here, he got
all pissed off and upset.

04:20.849 --> 04:24.395
He threw my bags out
and then he drove away.

04:24.396 --> 04:26.042

04:26.043 --> 04:27.638
- They're on the curb.

Did you guys, like, plan this?

10:30.776 --> 10:32.026
- [ALL] Cheers.

10:34.165 --> 10:37.248
- All right, who would like to start?

10:38.520 --> 10:42.207
- Well, I googled intervention letters.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.379
So we could get it right.

10:44.380 --> 10:45.352
- No, you're supposed to write it.

10:45.352 --> 10:46.323
- Wait a minute, I thought we were,

10:46.324 --> 10:48.169
I thought we shouldn't
say it in our own voice.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.572
- [IKE] In writing? Okay, sure.

10:50.573 --> 10:53.168
- It's like a homework assignment.

10:53.169 --> 10:54.336
Let's do this.

10:55.311 --> 10:58.338
- When did you write a letter?

10:58.339 --> 10:59.589
- Right. Right.

11:00.955 --> 11:01.788
Um, okay.

11:03.745 --> 11:05.994
"Dear Alis and Tomas,"

11:05.995 --> 11:09.581
"I'm here today because I
love and care about you."

11:09.582 --> 11:10.910
"I think you're doing the right thing,"

11:10.911 --> 11:12.223
"and that you're both entitled
to your personal plans."

11:12.224 --> 11:13.833
- Are they doing the right thing?

11:13.834 --> 11:15.470
I mean, what exactly are they doing?

11:15.471 --> 11:16.560
- Obviously, they weren't
too good together,

11:16.561 --> 11:17.522
so yeah, sure.

11:17.523 --> 11:18.925
- Oh, so being apart is the right thing.

11:18.926 --> 11:21.683
- What, did Google say that?

11:21.684 --> 11:22.529
- [MARIA] Cybil.

11:22.529 --> 11:23.362
- Sorry.

11:24.455 --> 11:27.366
- "Alis, I remember when we first met."

11:27.367 --> 11:28.598
"We were both spending another all-nighter"

11:28.599 --> 11:29.992
"in the campus library."

11:29.993 --> 11:32.224
"I will never forget
our marathon margaritas"

11:32.225 --> 11:33.663
"we had in the morning, when we finally"

11:33.664 --> 11:35.777
"handed in our papers."

11:35.778 --> 11:37.686
"We couldn't stop laughing,"

11:37.687 --> 11:39.256
"you told me I have the
most beautiful laughter"

11:39.257 --> 11:41.161
"you've ever heard,
and I should never ever"

11:41.162 --> 11:43.152
"stop laughing again."

11:43.153 --> 11:44.101
"You were the first to meet someone"

11:44.102 --> 11:46.354
"you could imagine
having that family with,"

11:46.355 --> 11:49.136
"the first to give birth
to a beautiful baby girl"

11:49.137 --> 11:51.321
"and the first to get a real job."

11:51.322 --> 11:55.930
"You are now also the
first to change your life."

11:55.931 --> 11:57.264
"People think being a good mother"

11:57.265 --> 11:59.098
"means you have to be there all the time,"

11:59.099 --> 12:01.011
"or be perfect, but really,"

12:01.012 --> 12:03.762
"a mother needs to just be happy."

12:05.820 --> 12:08.737
"Tomas, I know it is hard to be..."

12:10.189 --> 12:12.707
You know, I don't really
know what to say to Tomas.

12:12.708 --> 12:13.739
I'm sorry, I know he's your brother,

12:13.740 --> 12:15.180
and you love him, I just...

12:15.181 --> 12:17.471
- [IKE] We weren't judging
or taking sides, I thought.

12:17.472 --> 12:19.282
- Yeah, and I think
your love is beautiful.

12:19.283 --> 12:22.014
- Cybil just stays right
there, and judges everyone.

12:22.015 --> 12:23.960
- I want to be Cybil.

12:23.961 --> 12:27.403
- [CYBIL] That's because
he doesn't have a letter.

12:27.404 --> 12:28.991
- [IKE] Where's yours?

12:28.992 --> 12:29.825
Cybil.

12:32.373 --> 12:34.880
- Wait, are you talking shared custody?

12:34.881 --> 12:36.316
- Well..

12:36.317 --> 12:40.484
- Okay. I don't think Tomas
or Alis wants shared custody.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.155
- [IKE] I think we should
hear Cybil's letter.

12:44.156 --> 12:45.007
- Right.

12:45.007 --> 12:45.967
- Cybil doesn't have the letter,

12:45.968 --> 12:47.344
Cybil doesn't have a place card.

12:47.345 --> 12:49.038
- "Dear Alis and Tomas..."

12:49.039 --> 12:51.306
- Cybil has a place card if she wants one.

12:51.307 --> 12:56.276
- "We have known each other
for the past ten years.

12:56.277 --> 12:59.695
"You introduced me to my husband,"

12:59.696 --> 13:02.029
"and now, I wish you hadn't."

13:03.176 --> 13:04.327
"I know you think you are in"

13:04.328 --> 13:08.876
"the worst possible situation
imaginable, but you are not."

13:08.877 --> 13:12.356
"I wish I was in your situation."

13:12.357 --> 13:14.274
- [WOMAN] I'm so sorry.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.234
- [VINEKE] "Fighting with Peter"

13:20.235 --> 13:23.358
"about who will spend more
time with our own son."

13:23.359 --> 13:26.723
"This is why I want you to stop fighting."

13:26.724 --> 13:28.322
"You wish that what you feared most"

13:28.323 --> 13:30.074
"was what you were dealing with."

13:30.075 --> 13:32.700
"Because there's something worse"

13:32.701 --> 13:34.344
"that you could have never imagined."

13:34.345 --> 13:35.602
(PANS RATTLING)

13:35.603 --> 13:38.308
Oh my God, would you just fucking grow up?

13:38.309 --> 13:40.226
I'm so sick of you all.

13:41.534 --> 13:42.463
- [IKE] That's about right.

13:42.464 --> 13:44.283
- [FELICE] I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.

13:44.284 --> 13:45.117
- Didn't she say no anger?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.034
I'll do it.

13:47.081 --> 13:48.104
Go ahead, drink your wine, I'll be back.

13:48.105 --> 13:49.440
- Finds a way to make it about her.

13:49.441 --> 13:50.510
- [CYBIL] I'm sorry, I'm the asshole.

13:50.511 --> 13:51.344
I'll fix it.

13:51.344 --> 13:52.177
- No, you're not.

13:52.178 --> 13:53.416
It's stressful, it's stressful.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.250
- [CYBIL] I'm being an asshole.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.083
I'm sorry.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.236
- She's like an open wound,
all the goddamn time.

13:58.237 --> 13:59.721
- [MARIA] All right, she
thinks Peter left her

13:59.722 --> 14:01.081
because of Alis leaving Tom,

14:01.082 --> 14:03.356
just give her a break.

14:03.357 --> 14:05.220
- [IKE] We need to move
on to the happy stuff.

14:05.221 --> 14:06.481
- [MARIA] Wine?

14:06.482 --> 14:07.561
- Yeah.

14:07.562 --> 14:08.895
Yeah.

14:08.896 --> 14:10.006
Wine.

14:10.007 --> 14:11.648
And I'll write something.

14:11.649 --> 14:12.655
- [TOMAS] Start celebrating without me?

14:12.656 --> 14:13.489
- Hi.

14:13.490 --> 14:15.241
(CHEERING)

14:15.242 --> 14:17.905
Wow, you're earlier than I
thought you were gonna be.

14:17.906 --> 14:20.007
I'm so glad to see you.

14:20.008 --> 14:22.324
Here, I'm coming up.

14:22.325 --> 14:24.484
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

14:24.485 --> 14:26.152
It's gonna be great.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.618
- [ALL] Hi.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.062
- [TOMAS] Hi.

14:30.063 --> 14:30.896
- Hey.

14:33.327 --> 14:34.316
Good to see you.

14:34.316 --> 14:35.161
- Congratulations.

14:35.162 --> 14:36.694
- Thank you.

14:36.695 --> 14:38.532
- Hey, how's it going?

14:38.533 --> 14:39.366
- Good, how are you?

14:39.366 --> 14:40.366
- All right.

14:41.549 --> 14:42.938
- [IKE] Man.

14:42.939 --> 14:43.772
- Hey, buddy.

14:43.772 --> 14:44.605
Stranger.

14:44.605 --> 14:45.438
- Yeah.

14:45.438 --> 14:46.355
How are ya?

14:47.331 --> 14:50.426
- Come on, it's my sister's wedding, huh?

14:50.427 --> 14:53.010
I'm not gonna hold any grudges.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.389
Good to see you too.

14:56.390 --> 14:57.577
So, how do I get one of those?

14:57.578 --> 14:59.162
- [CYBIL] Yeah, you want some wine?

14:59.163 --> 15:00.746
You want some wine?

15:01.768 --> 15:02.878
You like red wine?

15:02.879 --> 15:04.299
- Red's good.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.595
As long as it keeps flowing.

15:05.596 --> 15:07.749
- Have some wine, you sad sack you.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.566
- A woman after my own heart, hi.

15:09.567 --> 15:10.715
- Good to see ya.

15:10.716 --> 15:12.098
- Just make sure you make eye contact.

15:12.099 --> 15:13.129
Make eye contact.

15:13.130 --> 15:13.963
- Yes, eye contact, eye contact.

15:13.964 --> 15:15.412
- Eye contact, eye contact.

15:15.413 --> 15:16.246
Got it.

15:16.247 --> 15:17.257
- Why is that important?

15:17.258 --> 15:19.350
- Uh, bad luck, I think, if you don't.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.739
- You have bad sex for
seven years if you don't.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.291
- Don't tell.

15:22.292 --> 15:26.125
Don't tell Maria anything
else about bad luck.

15:27.207 --> 15:29.311
- (MUMBLES) Hello, how are you?

15:29.312 --> 15:30.672
- [TOMAS] Well, you guys
did get a jump start on me,

15:30.673 --> 15:31.506
didn't you?

15:31.507 --> 15:33.024
- Yeah, exactly.

15:33.025 --> 15:33.858
- How have you been?

15:33.859 --> 15:34.947
You a stranger now?

15:34.948 --> 15:36.228
- Oh, good, good.

15:36.229 --> 15:37.062
Yep.

15:38.143 --> 15:39.643
Everything's good.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.569
I wouldn't mind lying down for a minute.

15:43.570 --> 15:44.685
- Oh!
- Oh, I'll help you.

15:44.686 --> 15:45.519
I'll show you around.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.900
- We're such terrible hosts.

15:46.901 --> 15:47.734
- No, no, no.

15:47.734 --> 15:48.567
It's all good.

15:48.568 --> 15:50.474
Save that, don't let anyone touch that.

15:50.475 --> 15:52.174
I'm good, I'm good.

15:52.175 --> 15:53.092
- Did you bring enough?

15:53.093 --> 15:54.404
- Jesus.

15:54.405 --> 15:55.238
God damn it.

15:55.239 --> 15:57.883
- [CYBIL] I don't care. He's a dick.

15:57.884 --> 15:59.517
- Hey.

15:59.518 --> 16:01.748
- That's why I can't write a letter.

16:01.749 --> 16:04.820
Cause I'll be like, I'll
just rip his face off.

16:04.821 --> 16:05.981
You're a dick!

16:05.982 --> 16:07.949
- Cybil, if I'd known
you had this side to you,

16:07.950 --> 16:09.620
we would have talked sooner.

16:09.621 --> 16:10.818
- It's totally not a judgy thing.

16:10.819 --> 16:12.648
I mean, how could you not judge that?

16:12.649 --> 16:13.494
Maria is the only one who is...

16:13.495 --> 16:14.697
- Not judging his bullshit.

16:14.698 --> 16:17.999
- Non-biased, just, it should just be her.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.498
- I know, but she said it
won't work if it's just her.

16:20.499 --> 16:22.045
- Oh yeah, because it's
totally gonna work.

16:22.046 --> 16:24.621
It's like, combined power,
like Captain Planet.

16:24.622 --> 16:26.605
- Because, you know,
Fel can hide anything.

16:26.606 --> 16:29.137
You know, Fel is feeling
something, she can bury it,

16:29.138 --> 16:31.046
and keep it away.

16:31.047 --> 16:31.986
No.

16:31.987 --> 16:33.670
- Woah. I'm stepping...

16:33.671 --> 16:34.774
- That's a beautiful thing!

16:34.775 --> 16:37.427
That's a beautiful thing!

16:37.428 --> 16:40.678
That's a, I love that about you, honey.

16:41.635 --> 16:42.836
- [CYBIL] Are you guys happy?

16:42.837 --> 16:44.337
- Yes, very happy.

16:45.331 --> 16:47.343
You son of a...

16:47.344 --> 16:51.581
- Like, you're my only
example of a happy couple.

16:51.582 --> 16:54.544
Otherwise, if you guys aren't
happy, we're all fucked,

16:54.545 --> 16:56.648
so just keep that in mind.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.504
- Happy is a...
- No pressure.

16:58.505 --> 16:59.338
- It's a relative term.

16:59.338 --> 17:00.171
- No, don't start that sentence.

17:00.171 --> 17:01.012
Don't start that.

17:01.013 --> 17:02.157
- [IKE] No, it is a relative term.

17:02.158 --> 17:03.550
- [FELICE] No, yeah,
you gotta find your own.

17:03.551 --> 17:05.103
- [IKE] Marriage isn't about happiness.

17:05.104 --> 17:05.936
Marriage is about...

17:05.936 --> 17:06.770
- Oh, great.

17:06.771 --> 17:08.536
- [IKE] I mean, it's not...

17:08.537 --> 17:12.185
- Why don't you write that
speech for my wedding?

17:12.186 --> 17:14.036
- [MARIA] It was Cybil's old room.

17:14.037 --> 17:14.869
- Wow.

17:16.484 --> 17:17.672
You seem nervous.

17:17.673 --> 17:19.045
It's coming, the big day.

17:19.046 --> 17:19.878
- It's coming, it's coming.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.126
I have to tell you something.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.377
Alis is coming.

17:24.704 --> 17:25.537
- What?

17:26.779 --> 17:28.678
The family is not together anymore.

17:28.679 --> 17:31.352
So you're taking all these
broken, scattered pieces,

17:31.353 --> 17:32.186
and you're throwing them together.

17:32.186 --> 17:33.154
Why did you think it was a good idea

17:33.155 --> 17:35.716
to be throwing all these
broken pieces together, huh?

17:35.717 --> 17:36.799
It was a bad idea.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.200
- [MARIA] But it's already been done.

17:38.201 --> 17:39.034
She's already coming,

17:39.035 --> 17:40.571
she's already said she's coming, so...

17:40.572 --> 17:41.406
- When is she coming?

17:41.407 --> 17:44.802
I have an hour to meet my ex-wife.

17:44.803 --> 17:45.803
Fuck, Maria!

17:46.651 --> 17:48.786
What are you doing to me?

17:48.787 --> 17:49.620
- [MARIA] I'm sorry.

17:49.621 --> 17:51.426
- I don't even want to stay, Maria.

17:51.427 --> 17:53.264
I'm not gonna do anything today.

17:53.265 --> 17:54.438
It's your big event,

17:54.439 --> 17:56.911
I'm not gonna do anything that's
gonna upset the apple cart,

17:56.912 --> 17:58.098
I just...

17:58.099 --> 17:59.310
- [MARIA] I want the
whole family together.

17:59.311 --> 18:00.644
If it's gonna be okay.

18:00.645 --> 18:02.753
- Do you really think this makes sense?

27:28.755 --> 27:30.825
- [IKE] Anyone would
like some more red wine?

27:30.826 --> 27:33.167
- [TOMAS] I would love some
more red wine, thank you.

27:33.168 --> 27:34.604
- [MARIA] I don't think he
needs any more red wine.

27:34.605 --> 27:35.438
- [BEN] I'll take some.

27:35.439 --> 27:36.774
- [TOMAS] I am a big boy, right?

27:36.775 --> 27:38.429
- [MARIA] Yeah, we just saw.

27:38.430 --> 27:39.391
- [TOMAS] We got it.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.378
- [IKE] Thanks a bunch, Ben.

27:42.379 --> 27:44.430
- Seems a decent dude, come on.

27:44.431 --> 27:45.531
We just had a nice meal.

27:45.532 --> 27:48.141
- We did not just have a nice meal.

27:48.142 --> 27:48.975
- Ugh.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.526
- [MARIA] You just had
several glasses of wine,

27:52.527 --> 27:54.998
and were really kind of a jerk.

27:54.999 --> 27:57.591
- Well, thank you very much, Maria.

27:57.592 --> 28:00.509
Wow, I was a jerk. Oh, my goodness.

28:04.537 --> 28:05.370
I'm sorry.

28:05.371 --> 28:06.667
I'm very sorry.

28:06.668 --> 28:07.521
- Apology accepted.

28:07.522 --> 28:10.100
- Thank you very much.

28:10.101 --> 28:12.018
Do I, I'm sorry, Maria.

28:13.912 --> 28:16.178
Look, I was doing apologies,
and you dismissed them.

28:16.179 --> 28:17.149
- Shocking.

28:17.150 --> 28:18.732
- Ooh, ouch. Sorry.

28:20.740 --> 28:21.573
That was funny.

28:21.573 --> 28:22.406
- [WOMAN] It's about time.

28:22.407 --> 28:24.051
- That was funny.

28:24.052 --> 28:25.479
That was funny.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.672
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

28:26.673 --> 28:27.519
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.921
- [VINEKE] God, someone's gonna die

28:28.922 --> 28:29.755
if you have another bottle.

28:29.756 --> 28:32.266
- [TOMAS] No one's gonna,
have you seen how tall I am?

28:32.267 --> 28:34.377
I'm only filled up to my calves.

28:34.378 --> 28:36.628
(LAUGHTER)

28:37.521 --> 28:40.104
Look what I found, dun-dun-dun.

28:43.644 --> 28:45.748
Do you want some rose, sweetheart?

28:45.749 --> 28:48.608
- [MARIA] Don't do that, I already...

28:48.609 --> 28:50.536
- Do you want some more?

28:50.537 --> 28:53.082
Do you want some more
attitude adjusts first?

28:53.083 --> 28:57.498
- You know, I think I just might
need to keep pace with you.

28:57.499 --> 28:59.188
- [TOMAS] Come on, Vineke, we'll toast.

28:59.189 --> 29:00.954
- [MARIA] Woah! Vinnie...

29:00.955 --> 29:03.753
- [IKE] And you were just served.

29:03.754 --> 29:06.118
- [TOMAS] No, she, she was just served.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.868
Sell the Thurber, come on.

29:07.869 --> 29:10.000
- It's what I need to
deal with Tomas tonight.

29:10.001 --> 29:13.937
- Oh, she brought it
back, she brought it back.

29:13.938 --> 29:17.058
Oh, I didn't mean to take that from you.

29:17.059 --> 29:17.892
We made eye contact.

29:17.893 --> 29:20.708
- [IKE] Cybil should be the
only one that can ever talk.

29:20.709 --> 29:23.014
She dictates the conversations.

29:23.015 --> 29:23.848
- [MARIA] Thank you, Cybil!

29:23.849 --> 29:25.603
- [ALL] Cybil.

29:25.604 --> 29:28.017
- [FELICE ] Here's to Cybil.

29:28.018 --> 29:29.264
Three cheers.

29:29.265 --> 29:32.163
- [IKE] To Cybil, for keeping us civil!

29:32.164 --> 29:34.289
Cybil, for keeping us civil.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.400
- Can I ask a favor?

29:36.401 --> 29:38.014
After we get married,

29:38.015 --> 29:39.722
every time I enter a room,

29:39.723 --> 29:43.336
will you please give
me a standing ovation?

29:43.337 --> 29:44.475
- Let's start now.

29:44.476 --> 29:45.577
Let's start now.

29:45.578 --> 29:47.894
- Cybil! Yes! Yes!

29:47.895 --> 29:50.679
(APPLAUSE)

29:50.680 --> 29:52.696
- [TOMAS] Welcome to
Cybilization, everybody.

29:52.697 --> 29:54.075
Welcome to Cybilization.

29:54.076 --> 29:55.169
- [WOMAN] Cybil.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.003
- She's good at that.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.982
- You're my Cybil-ing, I got your back.

29:57.983 --> 30:00.239
- And then, can you stand
up and wipe a tear away?

30:00.240 --> 30:01.225
- No.

30:01.225 --> 30:02.058
(LAUGHTER)

30:02.059 --> 30:04.058
- [CYBIL] Just one tear.

30:07.433 --> 30:08.850
But you have to be, yeah.

30:08.851 --> 30:10.768
It has to have meaning!

30:12.142 --> 30:15.164
- That is my sister-in-law,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:15.165 --> 30:17.867
Soon-to-be, soon-to-be. Soon-to-be.

30:17.868 --> 30:18.850
- [CYBIL] You're welcome.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.517
- Let's have a cheer to awkward moments.

30:20.518 --> 30:23.903
Here's to awkward fucking moments.

30:23.904 --> 30:26.042
- Awkward fucking moments.

30:26.043 --> 30:29.437
- [IKE] No, let's cheer to
not awkward fucking moments.

30:29.438 --> 30:30.852
- [BEN] To awkward moments.

30:30.853 --> 30:31.686
- Awkward.

30:32.920 --> 30:35.277
- [WOMAN] While fucking.

30:35.278 --> 30:36.435
- [IKE] You don't want to see me?

30:36.436 --> 30:38.353
Well, you won't see me.

30:48.906 --> 30:50.323
- Like, who else?

30:52.501 --> 30:53.531
Oh, just kidding.

30:53.532 --> 30:54.991
- No, you know Ike's got plenty.

30:54.992 --> 30:56.365
- [FELICE] Get a photobomb.

30:56.366 --> 30:57.685
- Get out of here.

30:57.686 --> 30:59.795
Thank you for ruining that lovely moment.

30:59.796 --> 31:01.105
- [TOMAS] Oh, I didn't ruin anything.

31:01.106 --> 31:03.189
He's got her all on tape.

31:07.022 --> 31:08.313
How was she, how was she?

31:08.314 --> 31:10.584
How were you when you
started, recreate the face.

31:10.585 --> 31:11.483
Turn around...

31:11.484 --> 31:14.697
- And she was like the coolest,
most gorgeous creature ever.

31:14.698 --> 31:15.624
- Stop it.
- Creature.

31:15.625 --> 31:17.681
- [MARIA] And she asked me out to coffee,

31:17.682 --> 31:19.119
and I freaked out and I didn't go.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.616
- Let that happen, let
it happen, let's focus.

31:20.617 --> 31:21.591
- With what person?

31:21.592 --> 31:23.024
Changes the relationship with...

31:23.025 --> 31:23.911
- [IKE] It's different.

31:23.912 --> 31:25.890
You have like, another
life to take care of,

31:25.891 --> 31:27.259
and it changes things.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.952
Like, child is difficult.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.547
- [TOMAS] Exactly, pussy.

31:30.548 --> 31:32.010
- Hey, I'm against that.

31:32.011 --> 31:34.702
Pussies do beautiful, wonderful things.

31:34.703 --> 31:37.181
Pussies are tender, pussies are sensitive,

31:37.182 --> 31:39.756
and they suffer and they push out life.

31:39.757 --> 31:41.351
They take a lot of pain.

31:41.352 --> 31:42.815
Here's to pussies.

31:42.816 --> 31:45.889
- Well, we can call him
a dick, and that's fine.

31:45.890 --> 31:50.054
- Because, tell me the last
time a pussy started a war.

31:50.055 --> 31:51.670
- Pussies stopped wars.

31:51.671 --> 31:53.223
Pussies stop wars.
- Pussies stop the wars.

31:53.224 --> 31:54.057
- Three cheers to that shit.

31:54.058 --> 31:55.779
- Um, her name is, her name is Alis.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.722
- [FELICE] Pussies can stop some wars.

31:57.723 --> 31:58.772
Thank you.

31:58.773 --> 32:01.554
- Maybe Felice and I
can get along after all.

32:01.555 --> 32:04.209
- There's double standards,
is all I'm saying.

32:04.210 --> 32:05.769
- [FELICE] All right, sure.

32:05.770 --> 32:08.489
When they talk about what
atrocities are going to happen

32:08.490 --> 32:10.328
to a village after it's been conquered,

32:10.329 --> 32:13.808
are pussies going to go
out and cause the damage?

32:13.809 --> 32:15.378
No, dicks do.

32:15.379 --> 32:16.565
- All right, so, okay.
- [MAN] It's true.

32:16.566 --> 32:18.149
- So you're saying women
are better than men.

32:18.150 --> 32:19.892
- [FELICE] No, I'm just saying pussies

32:19.893 --> 32:22.111
should not be used as a derogatory term.

32:22.112 --> 32:23.015
- [BEN] I love pussies.

32:23.016 --> 32:25.451
- [IKE] But dicks are a derogatory term.

32:25.452 --> 32:27.229
- That's what I'm saying.

32:27.230 --> 32:28.063
Don't you?

32:28.064 --> 32:29.688
- What?

32:29.689 --> 32:30.686
- Uh-oh.

32:30.686 --> 32:31.519
Things are breaking up.

32:31.519 --> 32:32.352
- Oh, you've gotta be...

32:32.352 --> 32:33.226
- [TOMAS] The party's breaking up.

32:33.227 --> 32:35.559
- [IKE] fucking kidding me.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.687
- Hey, Cybil, nice to see you.
- [IKE] Are you joking?

32:39.688 --> 32:40.771
Did you know?

32:43.373 --> 32:44.206
- Hey.

32:44.207 --> 32:45.622
- [FELICE] Hey.

32:45.623 --> 32:47.205
- [WOMAN] Hi.
- Hi.

32:47.206 --> 32:48.123
- Hi, guys.

32:49.750 --> 32:50.583
Let's get a hug.

32:50.584 --> 32:52.563
I want a hug, I want a hug, I want a hug.

32:52.564 --> 32:54.647
- I'm coming for hug two.

32:56.305 --> 32:57.652
- Hi, you.

32:57.653 --> 32:59.200
I'm glad you came!

32:59.201 --> 33:01.701
Hi! (MUMBLES)

33:03.141 --> 33:03.974
Hi, hi.

33:03.975 --> 33:05.268
- Hey, this is Marc.

33:05.269 --> 33:06.206
- [MARC] Hey.
- It's Felice.

33:06.207 --> 33:07.944
I've heard great things about you.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.399
Nice to meet you, in person!

33:09.400 --> 33:10.233
- Hi!

33:11.290 --> 33:13.063
- We've had wine, I, I, I can just...

33:13.064 --> 33:14.227
- Yeah, everybody's had a lot of wine.

33:14.228 --> 33:15.721
- You had dinner.

33:15.722 --> 33:17.483
- My mouth tastes like church.
- So, um.

33:17.484 --> 33:18.338
Um, I'm gonna show you two around.

33:18.339 --> 33:19.374
- [IKE] What does that mean?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.100
- Sure, yeah, we can move our stuff down.

33:21.101 --> 33:24.434
- Wine, and that bread that's flattened.

33:26.330 --> 33:27.415
- [WOMAN] He'll back down, right?

33:27.416 --> 33:28.662
- [MARIA] Do you want some wine?

33:28.663 --> 33:30.581
- [ALIS] Uh, we're gonna
put our stuff down.

33:30.582 --> 33:32.689
- [MARIA] All right.

33:32.690 --> 33:33.523
You got it?

33:33.524 --> 33:34.829
- [ALIS] I got it, it's...

33:34.830 --> 33:36.922
- [MARIA] Well, with Tomas
and all staying here...

33:36.923 --> 33:39.090
(MUMBLES)

33:46.644 --> 33:48.144
- Look who's here.

33:56.915 --> 33:58.915
Is there another bottle?

34:10.426 --> 34:13.176
(CAR DOOR SLAMS)

34:15.295 --> 34:18.128
(HEAVY BREATHING)

34:36.060 --> 34:37.414
- Did you know?

34:37.415 --> 34:39.069
- No.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.634
- [IKE] The fucking balls.

34:40.635 --> 34:41.967
- [VINEKE] Un...

34:42.829 --> 34:43.723
Believable.

34:43.724 --> 34:44.971
- [FELICE] Okay, relax.

34:44.972 --> 34:45.958
- [TOMAS] Maria, why
didn't you fucking tell me

34:45.960 --> 34:47.315
that she was bringing Marc?

34:47.317 --> 34:49.522
- I didn't know she was bringing Marc.

34:49.523 --> 34:51.889
- Yeah, I figured she was coming,

34:51.891 --> 34:52.909
I just didn't...

34:52.911 --> 34:54.380
- [TOMAS] Her being here is...

34:54.382 --> 34:57.217
- Tomas, I didn't know.
- [TOMAS] Bad enough.

34:57.218 --> 34:58.630
- And now she's got him?

34:58.631 --> 35:00.784
- [MARIA] I had no idea.

35:00.785 --> 35:02.745
- [IKE] Maria, you let him in the house.

35:02.746 --> 35:04.614
- What was I supposed to do?

35:04.615 --> 35:05.817
- [IKE] You say, "No."

35:05.818 --> 35:08.470
You kick him out on the fucking street.

35:08.471 --> 35:09.304
- No.

35:09.305 --> 35:11.518
- [IKE] That is not fucking cool.

35:11.519 --> 35:13.435
- He's a total asshole.

35:13.436 --> 35:16.652
- Well, what do you know about him?

35:16.653 --> 35:17.872
- It doesn't matter
what we know about him,

35:17.873 --> 35:19.184
it's not about him.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.426
- [FELICE] Yeah, you guys
are making it about him.

35:21.427 --> 35:23.740
You're saying he's a
total asshole. What...

35:23.741 --> 35:25.283
- No, it's not, I'm not saying that.

35:25.284 --> 35:26.760
- Please do share what information...

35:26.761 --> 35:28.023
- [IKE] I'm not saying
that he's an asshole.

35:28.024 --> 35:30.942
I'm saying that she's a fucking
asshole for bringing him.

35:30.943 --> 35:33.839
- [FELICE] Okay, maybe she
just wanted to feel accepted

35:33.840 --> 35:35.674
and loved and have someone with her.

35:35.675 --> 35:36.588
- Then you tell.

35:36.589 --> 35:37.867
Then you mention that's happening, okay?

35:37.868 --> 35:38.701
- She made her choice, okay?

35:38.702 --> 35:39.735
She made her fucking choice.
- You don't drop that bomb.

35:39.736 --> 35:41.516
You don't fucking drop that bomb.

35:41.517 --> 35:43.345
- And by the way, he doesn't give a shit

35:43.346 --> 35:44.906
about any of her friends.

35:44.907 --> 35:46.452
Let's just make that clear.

35:46.453 --> 35:47.526
- [FELICE] That's not
true, and that's not fair.

35:47.527 --> 35:50.300
- Oh, what interaction
have you had with him?

35:50.301 --> 35:51.826
- I have been with her recently,

35:51.827 --> 35:54.428
and she was grateful to
have the time and attention.

35:54.429 --> 35:56.542
- [VINEKE] What interaction have you had,

35:56.543 --> 35:57.376
- [TOMAS] Shut the fuck up,

35:57.376 --> 35:58.209
- you personally had with him?

35:58.210 --> 35:59.587
- [TOMAS] They can all
hear you inside, okay?

35:59.588 --> 36:01.156
- [IKE] It has nothing to do with him.

36:01.157 --> 36:02.837
- Of course, it apparently does!

36:02.838 --> 36:04.146
- Would you guys fucking relax,

36:04.147 --> 36:05.639
okay, they can hear you fucking inside.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.981
It's exactly what she fucking wants.

36:07.982 --> 36:08.988
- [VINEKE] I don't care.

36:08.989 --> 36:09.928
- [FELICE] Wow, you're
really making her to be

36:09.929 --> 36:11.598
some sort of extraordinary villain

36:11.599 --> 36:13.444
that structured this whole thing.

36:13.445 --> 36:14.278
- How would you...

36:14.279 --> 36:15.735
- [IKE] She did.

36:15.736 --> 36:17.402
- [MARIA] I invited her.

36:17.403 --> 36:18.396
I invited her.

36:18.397 --> 36:20.009
- [VINEKE] But how dare
she do that to you?

36:20.010 --> 36:21.119
- Yeah, bad fucking idea.
- [IKE] Yeah, you invited her.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.171
It is selfish. I am...

36:23.172 --> 36:24.005
- [MARIA] It was the
invitation we sent out.

36:24.005 --> 36:24.923
There was a plus one on it.

36:24.924 --> 36:26.590
I didn't even think.

36:27.703 --> 36:28.536
- [CYBIL] Who would have?

36:28.537 --> 36:29.790
- [IKE] She can't, she
can't hide under that,

36:29.791 --> 36:33.291
like, fucking hospitality bullshit. She...

36:37.545 --> 36:39.212
- [MARIA] It's done.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.521
- You know what we do? We...

36:43.522 --> 36:45.022
- [MARIA] Tomas...

36:46.786 --> 36:48.742
- Do you know how difficult
that is gonna make tomorrow?

36:48.743 --> 36:49.922
It is gonna make tomorrow impossible.

36:49.923 --> 36:51.042
- [MARIA] No, you guys don't know.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.627
No, we'll get rid of him in the morning.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.306
First thing, we'll kick him out.

36:54.307 --> 36:55.649
- [IKE] I mean, if that's what she did,

36:55.650 --> 36:56.817
she is not...

36:57.679 --> 36:58.512
- [FELICE] You say it like
she did something so horrible,

36:58.512 --> 36:59.345
- [VINEKE] You know what?

36:59.346 --> 37:00.795
- [FELICE] like she committed some crime.

37:00.796 --> 37:04.770
- [IKE] She brought, are
you, I am, that is...

37:04.771 --> 37:06.041
- [VINEKE] She actually did.

37:06.042 --> 37:08.872
She broke the law, basically.

37:08.873 --> 37:09.706
- Excuse me?

37:09.707 --> 37:11.593
- [MARIA] That is not
what tomorrow is about.

37:11.594 --> 37:12.850
No, tomorrow is about...

37:12.851 --> 37:13.684
- No, no, no, no.

37:13.684 --> 37:14.517
No, let's back up.

37:14.518 --> 37:17.247
What fucking law did she break?

37:17.248 --> 37:18.576
- [IKE] She committed adultery.

37:18.577 --> 37:19.981
- Thank you.
- That's, that's the law.

37:19.982 --> 37:22.024
- [FELICE] After she was
separated. What law...

37:22.025 --> 37:23.010
- [IKE] No.
- No. No.

37:23.010 --> 37:23.843
- Did she break?

37:23.844 --> 37:26.083
I'm sorry, what biblical
world are you living in,

37:26.084 --> 37:28.845
that she broke a law?
- Not after she was separated.

37:28.846 --> 37:33.261
She was fucking him long
before they were separated.

37:33.262 --> 37:34.915
- Why does this hurt you so badly?

37:34.916 --> 37:36.476
- [IKE] Fucking stoke the burning flames.

37:36.477 --> 37:39.310
- Gee, thought you were my friend.

37:41.045 --> 37:43.488
- [IKE] She does not need
any more excuse to fucking...

37:43.489 --> 37:45.906
(DOOR SLAMS)

37:53.039 --> 37:56.289
(FELICE AND IKE SHOUT)

38:00.026 --> 38:02.276
(LAUGHTER)

38:03.629 --> 38:04.738
- [IKE] This is funny!

38:04.739 --> 38:05.906
This is great!

38:07.460 --> 38:08.823
It's like I'm not right there with her,

38:08.824 --> 38:10.502
It's not, I'm, you know, I'm not there,

38:10.503 --> 38:12.374
then has to wake up after
three hours of sleep,

38:12.375 --> 38:13.729
and go work all day.

38:13.730 --> 38:14.693
That's not me.

38:14.694 --> 38:17.681
I am doing nothing, nothing wrong.

38:17.682 --> 38:18.515
- I didn't say that.

38:18.516 --> 38:19.946
- I am contributing nothing.
- I didn't say that.

38:19.947 --> 38:20.958
I didn't say that.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.180
Maybe your guilt is talking,

38:22.181 --> 38:23.014
but I didn't say that.

38:23.015 --> 38:24.770
- [IKE] Oh, my guilt?

38:24.771 --> 38:27.205
I think you put the guilt on me. Please.

38:27.206 --> 38:28.500
- [FELICE] Did anybody hear me say that?

38:28.501 --> 38:30.417
- Um, didn't you call
me not a good parent,

38:30.418 --> 38:31.709
because I don't check every 15 minutes?

38:31.710 --> 38:32.543
- That's not what I said.

38:32.544 --> 38:35.569
Wait for your guilt to talk.

38:35.570 --> 38:39.737
- [BEN] Wait, how long
have you guys been married?

38:40.729 --> 38:41.896
- Eight years.

38:43.132 --> 38:46.250
- How long did you guys
know each other before that?

38:46.251 --> 38:48.460
- [FELICE] A year.

38:48.461 --> 38:49.294
- [BEN] A year.

38:49.295 --> 38:50.894
- Yeah.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.695
- [IKE] Mm-hm.

38:52.696 --> 38:54.808
- [BEN] When, I was just...
- But you know what?

38:54.809 --> 38:56.089
We're gonna sleep in
the same bed together,

38:56.090 --> 38:57.277
then we're gonna wake up,

38:57.278 --> 38:58.667
I'm gonna bring her coffee,

38:58.668 --> 38:59.507
and you know what?

38:59.508 --> 39:00.589
She's gonna kiss me good morning,

39:00.590 --> 39:03.067
and everything is gonna be great.

39:03.068 --> 39:03.901
That's how it works.

39:03.901 --> 39:04.810
- Tell them.

39:04.810 --> 39:05.782
- [IKE] That's how it works, Ben.

39:05.783 --> 39:07.700
- Tell them that thing your dad says.

39:07.701 --> 39:08.565
- [BEN] What about my dad?

39:08.566 --> 39:09.776
- Tell them what your dad says.

39:09.777 --> 39:11.477
- [BEN] Oh, no, about his marriage thing?

39:11.478 --> 39:12.311
Come on.

39:14.545 --> 39:16.212
- [CYBIL] Tell them.

39:17.077 --> 39:18.909
- [BEN] Dad...

39:18.910 --> 39:21.708
I'm, okay, well, I'm about to turn 28.

39:21.709 --> 39:22.560
- They have been together 27 years.

39:22.561 --> 39:25.842
- No, that doesn't make sense.

39:25.843 --> 39:26.922
Well, yes.

39:26.923 --> 39:28.213
They've been together a long time.

39:28.214 --> 39:29.625
I mean, it's a long time,

39:29.626 --> 39:31.415
how do you do it, right?

39:31.416 --> 39:32.831
So I asked them that.

39:32.832 --> 39:35.405
And you know, he said,

39:35.406 --> 39:38.361
he said, "The first
seven years are great."

39:38.362 --> 39:39.610
- Go team.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.318
- [IKE] That's why we pop round two.

39:41.319 --> 39:44.486
- "The next seven years are pure Hell,

39:45.331 --> 39:49.331
"and after you get past
that second seven years,"

"you're so thankful that
the Hell has passed,"

39:54.641 --> 39:56.551
"that, I mean, it couldn't
get any worse, right?"

39:56.552 --> 39:58.317
"So you stay together,"

39:58.318 --> 40:02.485
"'Cause, I mean, it couldn't
get any worse, right?"

- Oh, wait.

40:40.552 --> 40:42.700
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40:42.701 --> 40:44.325
- Breakfast?

40:44.326 --> 40:45.826
- Yeah. After you.

40:48.173 --> 40:50.296
- [FELICE] Did you hear what I said?

40:50.297 --> 40:53.020
A hurricane, that its'...

40:53.021 --> 40:55.854
They're closing the parks at five.

40:56.882 --> 40:59.248
And they're closing the bridges at seven.

40:59.249 --> 41:00.082
- All right, we're not
going to get into that,

41:00.083 --> 41:02.037
that you're...

41:02.038 --> 41:02.871
'Kay.

41:02.871 --> 41:03.710
- That I'm what?

41:03.711 --> 41:06.127
- That I'm not a good father.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.625
- [FELICE] I didn't, I'm
not, I didn't say that.

41:09.626 --> 41:10.636
- You can do this.

41:10.637 --> 41:11.883
- Is he gonna be okay?

41:11.884 --> 41:12.762
- I don't know.

41:12.763 --> 41:14.950
- I'm fine, is she...

41:14.951 --> 41:16.518
- [ALIS] Come here.

41:16.519 --> 41:19.076
- Uwe and Rosie just bailed.

41:19.077 --> 41:20.333
- I will cook.

41:20.334 --> 41:21.496
You can't cook.

41:21.497 --> 41:23.859
- Don't make that face at me.

41:23.860 --> 41:25.044
Anger only reflects anger.

41:25.045 --> 41:27.493
If anyone's angry...
- [MARIA] Everybody's angry.

41:27.494 --> 41:30.319
- If anyone's angry, they're
just gonna be angry back.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.155
So we have to take the high road,

41:32.156 --> 41:33.583
and try not to be angry.

41:33.584 --> 41:35.673
- It's just a beautiful morning.

41:35.674 --> 41:37.784
- [CYBIL] Places, places, places.

41:37.785 --> 41:41.355
- [MARIA] All right, we all
know what we're doing, right?

41:41.356 --> 41:42.518
- Everybody's waiting for me.

41:42.519 --> 41:44.110
- [ALL] Good morning.

41:44.111 --> 41:47.093
- [MARIA] We're glad you're here.

41:47.094 --> 41:49.281
- [WOMAN] Good morning.
- So, coffee?

41:49.282 --> 41:51.346
- [WOMAN] Want something,
want some coffee?

41:51.347 --> 41:52.629
What do you want in your coffee?

41:52.630 --> 41:53.886
- Just black is fine.

- Morning, hello.
- Alis, hi.

41:55.499 --> 41:56.999
Thanks for coming.

41:58.498 --> 41:59.474
Okay, come on in.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.382
So, Marc, can you do me a favor?

42:01.383 --> 42:02.216
- [MARC] Yeah.

42:02.217 --> 42:05.343
- I think Ben probably needs
some help out by the pool.

42:05.344 --> 42:06.177
- Oh.

42:06.177 --> 42:07.010
- [MARIA] But could you...

42:07.010 --> 42:07.843
- I'll just have some,

42:07.843 --> 42:08.676
let me sit down and have some breakfast.

42:08.677 --> 42:10.724
- You know what, he sort of
needs some help right now,

42:10.725 --> 42:13.891
so if you grab one, I promise
I'll get you sitting down,

42:13.892 --> 42:15.097
- [MARC] It can wait five minutes.

42:15.098 --> 42:15.931
- I'll make you some eggs later.

42:15.931 --> 42:16.764
- [MARC] What's the problem?

42:16.764 --> 42:17.646
- [MARIA] Actually, it can't right now.

42:17.647 --> 42:19.092
- [VINEKE] Ben's waiting.

42:19.093 --> 42:19.926
- Yeah, he's waiting.

42:19.927 --> 42:21.042

Croissant, muffin...

42:21.043 --> 42:21.876
- Thank you.

42:21.877 --> 42:23.437
- [MARC] What's going on?
- I have no idea.

42:23.438 --> 42:24.271
- [MARIA] It's okay.

42:24.271 --> 42:25.104
I'll take good care of her,

42:25.105 --> 42:26.941
I promise I'll give her
back in just a minute.

42:26.942 --> 42:29.159
I just need some, Ben needs some help.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.308
- You know, I'd like for us
to eat breakfast together.

42:31.309 --> 42:32.149
- You know what, I'm sorry.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.896
I certainly don't mean
to be rude, so thank you.

42:33.897 --> 42:35.531
- You don't mean to be rude?

42:35.532 --> 42:37.489
- [MARIA] I know, I know,
it's me, it's all me.

42:37.490 --> 42:38.726
- Are these organic?

42:38.727 --> 42:40.605
I only do organic.

42:40.606 --> 42:41.811
- Sure. Yeah.

42:41.812 --> 42:43.101
I saw you last eating, remember?

42:43.102 --> 42:44.584
- [TOMAS] You okay?

42:44.585 --> 42:46.807
I'm just gonna grab
something and go upstairs.

42:46.808 --> 42:47.921
- [MARIA] No, I would like for you

42:47.922 --> 42:48.755
to stay for a few minutes.

42:48.756 --> 42:50.025
- [WOMAN] Alis, coffee?
- No.

42:50.026 --> 42:53.443
- What's with all the cards and nonsense?

42:54.852 --> 42:56.926
- Why is everyone acting
like this is a funeral?

42:56.927 --> 42:57.996
What is this?

42:57.997 --> 42:58.909
- [MARIA] Everyone sit down, please.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.574
- [ALIS] What is this? What is this?

43:00.575 --> 43:03.408
- [MARIA] This is an intervention.

43:05.945 --> 43:09.674
- [TOMAS] I'm gonna have an aspirin.

43:09.675 --> 43:11.091
Lead by example.

43:11.092 --> 43:12.411
- [ALIS] Are you serious right now?

43:12.412 --> 43:13.245
- [MARIA] Yeah, I'm serious.

43:13.246 --> 43:15.167
This is my idea, so bear with me...

43:15.168 --> 43:16.117
- Can we just have breakfast?

43:16.118 --> 43:17.917
- Did you know about this?

43:17.918 --> 43:20.605
- No, I didn't know about this.

43:20.606 --> 43:21.612
- Well, not like I believe anything

43:21.613 --> 43:24.831
you say these days anyway, so.
- Why would you?

43:24.832 --> 43:26.211
- All right.

43:26.212 --> 43:27.936
Tomas, could you please sit down?

43:27.937 --> 43:31.242
- Why? Just say what
you're gonna say, please.

43:31.243 --> 43:34.326
- [MARIA] Would you sit down, please?

43:35.464 --> 43:36.297
Thank you.

43:37.752 --> 43:39.385
- [TOMAS] Should I sit
here where my name is?

43:39.386 --> 43:41.243
- [MARIA] That'd be great.

43:41.244 --> 43:43.323
- [VINEKE] Oh, I'll just hold my tongue.

43:43.324 --> 43:45.741
- Everything okay, Vineke?

43:45.742 --> 43:48.601
- This is, this is an intervention.

43:48.602 --> 43:49.609
This is an intervention.

43:49.610 --> 43:50.443
- For what?

43:50.444 --> 43:51.735
- [MARIA] The only way this is gonna work

43:51.736 --> 43:55.569
is if I'm the only one
that talks out of turn.

43:57.356 --> 43:59.091
Because if there's one
person that talks out of,

43:59.092 --> 44:01.096
otherwise we're gonna break into fighting.

44:01.097 --> 44:04.276
And really, we've had
enough of that. So...

44:04.277 --> 44:05.110
- This is stupid.

44:05.111 --> 44:07.197
I came here to celebrate your wedding,

44:07.198 --> 44:08.031
not to have a fucking intervention.

44:08.032 --> 44:10.373
- [MARIA] Well, that's why I
asked you to come a day early.

44:10.374 --> 44:13.598
Because we really want to get

44:13.599 --> 44:14.981
this settled before we get married.

44:14.982 --> 44:19.561
- Get this, I'm sorry, this
is our life, not yours.

44:19.562 --> 44:20.487
- Oh, did you happen to know

44:20.488 --> 44:22.776
that your life affects our lives?

44:22.777 --> 44:24.851
Hello, have you noticed this yet?

44:24.852 --> 44:25.923
- Maybe if you took a step back

44:25.924 --> 44:28.764
and dealt with your own life.

44:28.765 --> 44:32.456
Honestly, honestly none of
you have been there for me.

44:32.457 --> 44:33.824
None of you have been there for me,

44:33.825 --> 44:35.072
- [FELICE] Okay, that is not true,

44:35.073 --> 44:35.906
and that's not fair.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.837
- [VINEKE] That isn't true.
- Yeah, okay.

44:37.838 --> 44:39.206
- [VINEKE] Look, how come we follow you

44:39.207 --> 44:40.715
when you decide to go run
off with some other guy?

44:40.716 --> 44:41.714
- [MARIA] Wait, wait, wait, Vineke.

44:41.715 --> 44:43.382
- That's not fair either.

44:43.383 --> 44:45.517
- [MARIA] Felice, everybody.

44:45.518 --> 44:46.351
Thank you.

44:47.667 --> 44:51.732
We are here because we love both of you.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.268
- We're here because
you're getting married,

44:53.269 --> 44:54.898
and I'm trying to support
you in your marriage.

44:54.899 --> 44:56.034
I don't know why,

44:56.035 --> 44:57.180
why would you even come?

44:57.181 --> 44:58.775
- Tomas, I asked you to come a day early.

44:58.776 --> 44:59.889
That's why we're here today early.

44:59.890 --> 45:02.040
- Yeah, we thought...

45:02.041 --> 45:03.169
- What we're going to do...

45:03.170 --> 45:04.003
- You know what I'd like to know?

45:04.003 --> 45:04.836
Why you're here a day early.

45:04.836 --> 45:05.745
- I feel like you're
ganging up on us, actually,

45:05.745 --> 45:06.578
is what I feel like.

45:06.578 --> 45:07.490
- Can you please not talk to each other?

45:07.490 --> 45:08.483
You can talk to me.

45:08.484 --> 45:10.570
- I would like to know why
she's here a day early.

45:10.571 --> 45:11.483
- I was invited.

45:11.484 --> 45:14.135
- [MARIA] This is about all
of your friends and family

45:14.136 --> 45:17.111
coming to tell you how much we love you,

45:17.112 --> 45:19.224
and how sad we are that things

45:19.225 --> 45:21.010
are getting so out of control.

45:21.011 --> 45:22.525
- [VINEKE] And it's about Sam.

45:22.526 --> 45:24.490
- Well, honestly, let's be...

45:24.491 --> 45:26.005
You know what? Fuck it.

45:26.006 --> 45:29.077
- [MARIA] Things have gotten
really out of control lately.

45:29.078 --> 45:30.159
- Yes, they have.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.328
I was almost in jail
because of this fucker.

45:32.329 --> 45:34.777
Let's talk about who
is really out of line.

45:34.778 --> 45:36.563
- Okay, what my lawyer does
is not what I do, okay?

45:36.564 --> 45:38.428
- [MARIA] Please don't talk
directly to each other.

45:38.429 --> 45:39.929
Please talk to me.

45:41.490 --> 45:42.660
- [ALIS] I'm sorry, this is bullshit.

45:42.661 --> 45:43.494
- Alis.

45:43.494 --> 45:44.370
Here's the deal:

45:44.371 --> 45:46.469
You can walk out the door, it's okay.

45:46.470 --> 45:47.303
But if you do,

45:47.304 --> 45:48.400
if either of you do,

45:48.401 --> 45:49.914
you need to know, that's it.

45:49.915 --> 45:50.884
We're done.

45:50.885 --> 45:52.994
I won't be helping you see Sam anymore.

45:52.995 --> 45:55.126
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Well, you have to.

45:55.127 --> 45:55.973
That's actually court-mandated.

45:55.974 --> 45:57.605
- You're fucking threatening us now?

45:57.606 --> 46:00.208
- [MARIA] If either of you
walk out the door, that's it.

46:00.209 --> 46:03.278
We are not a part of your lives anymore.

46:03.279 --> 46:04.850
We love you and we are here to help you.

46:04.851 --> 46:06.187
- It feels manipulative
to me, to be honest.

46:06.188 --> 46:07.566
- [MARIA] Well, I'm
sorry it feels that way,

46:07.567 --> 46:10.067
but would you please humor us?

46:11.970 --> 46:12.803
Thank you.

46:13.688 --> 46:14.974
- Got your security blanket here,

46:14.975 --> 46:15.863
he's standing outside.

46:15.864 --> 46:18.248
- [MARIA] Tomas.
- Fuck you.

46:18.249 --> 46:21.166
(BOTTLES CLINKING)

46:35.408 --> 46:36.241
- Hey.

46:38.293 --> 46:39.543
How's it going?

46:42.533 --> 46:43.366
- 'Sup?

46:44.500 --> 46:47.331
- Um, can I help you out with that?

46:47.332 --> 46:49.415
- [BEN] Nah, I've got it.

46:50.670 --> 46:51.670
- All right.

46:57.472 --> 46:58.805
Shitty day, huh?

47:03.435 --> 47:05.768
Just like a storm, probably.

47:12.105 --> 47:12.938
Yeah.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.285
Got a lot of beer there.

47:16.286 --> 47:18.703
- Yeah, it's for the wedding.

47:22.173 --> 47:25.256
- [MARC] Yeah, it's quite a lot, man.

47:29.640 --> 47:30.957
- Do you want a beer?

47:30.958 --> 47:31.791
- Aw, pff.

47:33.181 --> 47:34.764
I mean, no, no, no.

47:37.744 --> 47:41.222
It's kind of, it's kind
of early for beer, right?

47:41.223 --> 47:42.205
- I mean, whatever, man.

47:42.206 --> 47:43.824
Have one or have not, you know?

47:43.825 --> 47:45.908
Whatever you've gotta do.

47:49.808 --> 47:51.641
- You're cool with it?

47:52.950 --> 47:54.436
- Yeah.

47:54.437 --> 47:56.020
- Yeah, okay, cool.

47:56.890 --> 47:57.898
Thanks.

47:57.899 --> 47:58.732
- Yep.

48:02.521 --> 48:04.688
- Sorry, I mean, I'm Marc.

48:05.579 --> 48:07.835
- Yeah, I know who you are.

48:07.836 --> 48:10.451
You're going out with Alis, right?

48:10.452 --> 48:11.285
- Yeah.

48:11.286 --> 48:13.202
We're comrades in arms.

48:14.783 --> 48:16.029
- What does that mean?

48:16.030 --> 48:19.137
- [MARC] We're both going
through, uh, shitty divorces.

48:19.138 --> 48:21.214
- Sorry to hear that, buddy.

48:21.215 --> 48:22.215
- It's cool.

48:23.077 --> 48:24.244
I'm a big boy.

48:25.245 --> 48:27.238
I can take it.

48:27.239 --> 48:28.072
I think.

48:31.213 --> 48:32.046
Wait.

48:33.984 --> 48:35.029
Ben, right?

48:35.030 --> 48:35.863
- Yep.

48:35.863 --> 48:36.780
- Oh, shit.

48:37.874 --> 48:42.041
Please tell me you're not the
guy that Tomas thought was me.

48:44.150 --> 48:44.983
Oh, shit.

48:46.226 --> 48:49.119
Dude, you caught so much shit for that.

48:49.120 --> 48:49.953
- I did.

48:49.954 --> 48:50.989
- And you're still here.

48:50.990 --> 48:52.045
- I am.

48:52.046 --> 48:53.236
- I'm sorry about that.

48:53.237 --> 48:54.070
- Whatever, man.

48:54.071 --> 48:55.290
Fuck Tomas. I hate him.

48:55.291 --> 48:56.874
- Yeah, fuck Tomas.

48:59.897 --> 49:01.730
Why don't you join me?

49:02.804 --> 49:06.137
- [TOMAS] Are all you guys part of this?

49:06.977 --> 49:07.810
- Yes.

49:07.811 --> 49:09.021
Were all of us affected by the way

49:09.022 --> 49:10.379
that you guys are behaving? Yes?

49:10.380 --> 49:13.117
- [ALIS] I don't understand
what the end-game is here.

49:13.118 --> 49:14.710
What is the point of this?

49:14.711 --> 49:16.628
- The point is to talk.

49:17.593 --> 49:18.565
To talk.

49:18.566 --> 49:20.030
- [ALIS] You think we don't talk?

49:20.031 --> 49:22.151
- [ALL] No.
- We don't know.

49:22.152 --> 49:23.402
You don't talk.

49:24.357 --> 49:25.343
- [MARIA] All right, all right, all right.

49:25.344 --> 49:26.711
- You think it's gonna be any different

49:26.712 --> 49:29.709
by putting us in this situation?

49:29.710 --> 49:31.378
I feel that this is personal,

49:31.379 --> 49:33.011
and that you're making it very public,

49:33.012 --> 49:34.102
and it makes me uncomfortable.

49:34.103 --> 49:34.995
- [MARIA] We are all of your friends.

49:34.995 --> 49:35.987
- Would you let her know it is personal,

49:35.988 --> 49:38.193
that it's been personally
affecting all of us?

49:38.194 --> 49:39.522
- [ALIS] What are you so angry about?

49:39.523 --> 49:41.561
I don't understand what
you're so angry about.

49:41.562 --> 49:43.124
Just because you are heartbroken,

49:43.125 --> 49:44.357
and dealing with your own grief,

49:44.358 --> 49:45.206
doesn't mean you should take it out on us.

49:45.207 --> 49:46.831
- [MARIA] Okay, the whole
point is not to be judgemental.

49:46.832 --> 49:49.242
- [VINEKE] Hello, what about Sam?

49:49.243 --> 49:50.530
That's really what this is about.

49:50.531 --> 49:52.490
- What about Sam in G?

49:52.491 --> 49:53.702
That's the reason why I'm here,

49:53.703 --> 49:54.577
is to see my daughter,

49:54.578 --> 49:56.233
and she's not even here, so.

49:56.234 --> 49:58.477
- So, she's coming tomorrow.

49:58.478 --> 50:01.333
And I would prefer it if
what's-his-face wasn't here.

50:01.334 --> 50:02.521
- He has a name.

50:02.522 --> 50:03.542
You know he has a name.

50:03.543 --> 50:04.400
- All right, all right, Marc, yeah.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.233
Marc.

50:05.234 --> 50:06.353
- Well, I'm with him.

50:06.354 --> 50:07.396
And this is a wedding.

50:07.397 --> 50:08.826
I get a plus one.

50:08.827 --> 50:10.170
I'm not gonna apologise for that.

50:10.171 --> 50:11.004
I would like to...

50:11.005 --> 50:12.078
- Well, Sam is arriving tomorrow, okay,

50:12.079 --> 50:14.356
and I don't want him around her.

50:14.357 --> 50:16.197
- Well, they've met, and they
have a great relationship.

50:16.198 --> 50:17.087
- Oh yeah, oh, great.

50:17.088 --> 50:18.958
So you guys get to go
and play fucking house,

50:18.959 --> 50:20.063
while I'm not there?

50:20.064 --> 50:21.212
- [MARIA] That's not what this is about.

50:21.213 --> 50:22.583
- That is what this is about.

50:22.584 --> 50:24.133
It's about my daughter.

50:24.134 --> 50:25.558
- Listen, just because you have

50:25.559 --> 50:27.092
no personal life outside of hers,

50:27.093 --> 50:28.054
- Oh, fuck you, okay, Alis?
- It's not my fault.

50:28.054 --> 50:28.971
- Fuck you.

50:30.112 --> 50:32.529
(RAIN FALLS)

51:09.146 --> 51:10.941
- This is nice.

51:10.942 --> 51:11.775
- [ALIS] Honestly, I have done

51:11.776 --> 51:12.961
nothing wrong in this situation.

51:12.962 --> 51:13.935
Following the heart...

51:13.936 --> 51:15.599
- Right, you were that
innocent fucking virgin.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.744
- It is not wrong to divorce someone,

51:17.745 --> 51:19.099
so sue me!

51:19.100 --> 51:20.741
I'm sorry that you're hurting.
- I did sue you.

51:20.742 --> 51:21.847
- [ALIS] You think I'm not hurting?

51:21.848 --> 51:22.980
- We can't even agree on anything.

51:22.981 --> 51:24.457
How are we gonna share her?

51:24.458 --> 51:25.952
- [ALIS] That's the whole
reason why we're here.

51:25.953 --> 51:26.836
- [MARIA] Like I said before,

51:26.837 --> 51:30.003
I understand how hurt you are by this.

51:31.136 --> 51:33.454
- This is so fucking ridiculous.

51:33.455 --> 51:35.734
None of you guys fucking
understand anything.

51:35.735 --> 51:38.173
Right, that's why I don't
even talk to you anymore!

51:38.174 --> 51:40.632
It's why I never say
fucking anything to you!

51:40.633 --> 51:42.515
(SHOUTING)

51:42.516 --> 51:43.570
I am thinking about Sam!

51:43.571 --> 51:45.827
I'm the only one thinking about Sam!

51:45.828 --> 51:48.411
(RAIN PATTERS)

51:51.291 --> 51:52.896
- I like the sound of the rain.

51:52.897 --> 51:55.982
(IMITATES RAIN)

51:55.983 --> 51:59.150
I love sleeping in the rain, actually.

52:03.299 --> 52:07.608
Not like, not like that,
know what I'm saying, just...

52:07.609 --> 52:09.050
Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying, man.

52:09.051 --> 52:11.126
It's all right.

52:11.127 --> 52:13.344
- It's fucking cold.

52:13.345 --> 52:15.371
- [MARIA] Stop this battle.
- This is not helping!

52:15.372 --> 52:16.284
Don't you understand?

52:16.285 --> 52:18.302
Shut up, Maria, shut up!

52:18.303 --> 52:19.956
- I have nothing left to lose.

52:19.957 --> 52:22.443
And you think he's gonna give two inches?

52:22.444 --> 52:25.257
- I'm not letting you take her away, okay?

52:25.258 --> 52:27.633
- Alis, if you yell like this, it won't.

52:27.634 --> 52:29.382
- If I yell like this?

52:29.383 --> 52:30.452
If I yell like this?

52:30.453 --> 52:31.286
- [MARIA] Both of you.

52:31.287 --> 52:32.984
I understand, I understand
how hard things are right now.

52:32.985 --> 52:34.078
- I'm sorry, this is bullshit.

52:34.079 --> 52:35.605
No, you don't understand.

52:35.606 --> 52:37.764
What you're trying to do is
you're trying to understand,

52:37.765 --> 52:40.956
but until you live with this
man every day of your life,

52:40.957 --> 52:42.528
and deal with his anger issues,

52:42.529 --> 52:43.754
and then see them passed
down to your child,

52:43.755 --> 52:45.104
- You weren't even there.
You weren't even there.

52:45.105 --> 52:45.938
- You don't understand.

52:45.938 --> 52:46.878

01:03:10.096 --> 01:03:12.192
for like, a fucking nice person, right?

01:03:12.193 --> 01:03:13.682
(CYBIL LAUGHS)

01:03:13.683 --> 01:03:15.239
You actually think I'm funny.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.167
- [CYBIL] Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.536
- [MARC] She's getting married today.

01:03:18.537 --> 01:03:19.370
Did you know that?

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:20.370
- [SILA] No.

01:03:21.712 --> 01:03:23.212
- [MARC] Yeah, that's why I'm here.

01:03:23.213 --> 01:03:25.832
- [SILA] Really? You're
here for a wedding?

01:03:25.833 --> 01:03:26.666
Oh my god.

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:27.910
Okay, wait, Marc, for just one second

01:03:27.911 --> 01:03:30.485
I want to hear there are
like, weird happy stories.

01:03:30.486 --> 01:03:32.236
Who are you marrying?

01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:34.667
No way.

01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:38.134
Seriously? Gay marriage?

01:03:38.135 --> 01:03:39.106
- [CYBIL] So gay.

01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:39.939
- So gay.

01:03:41.853 --> 01:03:42.686
Wow.

01:03:45.681 --> 01:03:46.931
Marriage. Ha...

01:03:51.188 --> 01:03:53.688
(PHONE RINGS)

01:03:54.889 --> 01:03:57.517
Whose phone is ringing?

01:03:57.518 --> 01:03:59.525
- It's the home, it's the home phone.

01:03:59.526 --> 01:04:01.269
- [SILA] Home phone?

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.270
Go ahead, get the phone.

01:04:07.992 --> 01:04:09.224
- Hello?

01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:10.443
- [SILA] Who is it?

01:04:10.444 --> 01:04:13.288
- I don't know, it's a guy.

01:04:13.289 --> 01:04:14.678
It's a recording.

01:04:14.679 --> 01:04:15.651
- [SILA] What's it say?

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:16.624
Did you not pay your bill?

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:19.833
- [CYBIL] No, it's about the hurricane.

01:04:19.834 --> 01:04:21.591
They want us to shut down all the,

01:04:21.592 --> 01:04:24.148
to turn off our electricity,
and things like that.

01:04:24.149 --> 01:04:25.918
- Okay, hang up, hang up.

01:04:25.919 --> 01:04:29.720
That's one of the, okay, come on back.

01:04:29.721 --> 01:04:31.331
Who's gonna be, one, two, three.

01:04:31.332 --> 01:04:32.911
One, two, three, four.

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:36.040
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:37.407
Nine, 10.

01:04:37.408 --> 01:04:38.668
Even!

01:04:38.669 --> 01:04:40.083
That's, that works nicely.

01:04:40.084 --> 01:04:42.987
So, one, two, three, are my friends.

01:04:42.988 --> 01:04:44.571
And then, yeah, ha.

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:52.720
Okay, yeah, I'll let you be my friend.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.267
Hang in there, babe.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:59.705
It'll all be over soon.

01:04:59.706 --> 01:05:01.109
Right?

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:04.717
You can do anything if
there's a time limit on it.

01:05:04.718 --> 01:05:06.635
And seriously, you can.

01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:10.360
You can do anything.

01:05:10.361 --> 01:05:13.898
You can do anything, so
we're gonna make team Sila,

01:05:13.899 --> 01:05:15.821
and we're gonna make team Marc,

01:05:15.822 --> 01:05:18.015
and we're gonna sit at the table,

01:05:18.016 --> 01:05:19.900
and we're gonna work it out.

01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:23.068
And we're gonna save my family, right?

01:05:25.508 --> 01:05:27.412
The one I made.

01:05:27.413 --> 01:05:29.535
'Cause I didn't have one, I made one.

01:05:29.536 --> 01:05:30.872
I made one. We have one.

01:05:30.873 --> 01:05:31.873
We have one.

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.176
That was supposed to be enough, right?

01:05:35.177 --> 01:05:37.227
'Cause like, if you
don't have one above you,

01:05:37.228 --> 01:05:38.476
you have one below you,

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:40.810
and then it goes from there.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.622
You're right, Sila.

01:05:47.355 --> 01:05:48.438
You're right.

01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:52.532
Okay, so.

01:05:53.904 --> 01:05:55.987
There's this funny thing.

01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.706
God, I feel compelled.

01:05:59.707 --> 01:06:00.707
It just, oh.

01:06:04.959 --> 01:06:06.792
So, those are my kids.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.717
Those are my best thing I ever did.

01:06:13.538 --> 01:06:14.998
Really, the only thing I've done.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.575
- [MARC] That's not true.

01:06:16.576 --> 01:06:17.409
- Oh.

01:06:19.717 --> 01:06:20.845
That's my dad.

01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:21.763
He's not...

01:06:24.639 --> 01:06:29.270
God, I think we're lucky
he's not alive anymore.

01:06:29.271 --> 01:06:31.416
He would fucking kill you.

01:06:31.417 --> 01:06:33.500
He would kill you for me.

01:06:39.602 --> 01:06:40.769
Easy pickings.

01:06:43.443 --> 01:06:46.247
My name's Alis, and I'm
coming to your town,

01:06:46.248 --> 01:06:47.988
and I'm gonna fuck up your family.

01:06:47.989 --> 01:06:50.239
It's like a bad, um, right?

01:06:53.161 --> 01:06:56.994
You might notice that
our happy family is, um,

01:06:59.174 --> 01:07:02.131
that my husband's not in
any of the fucking pictures.

01:07:02.132 --> 01:07:03.569
You might notice that.

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:05.403
You might notice that.

01:07:11.155 --> 01:07:13.645
You're, that's, really, thank you so much!

01:07:13.646 --> 01:07:15.299
Thank you, oh my God.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.174
Thank you.

01:07:16.175 --> 01:07:17.374
Oh, that's what I should do.

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:18.921
I should just go make some friends,

01:07:18.922 --> 01:07:20.241
and like, what?

01:07:20.242 --> 01:07:21.406
Make some family.

01:07:21.407 --> 01:07:22.240
Just make it!

01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:23.637
I made a fucking family,

01:07:23.638 --> 01:07:25.547
and it's falling apart!

01:07:25.548 --> 01:07:27.106
Do you understand me?

01:07:27.107 --> 01:07:28.834
Do you understand me?

01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:29.668
- [MARC] Babe, where are the...

01:07:29.668 --> 01:07:30.501
- I made one!

01:07:30.501 --> 01:07:31.497
I made a family!

01:07:31.498 --> 01:07:32.951
I didn't have a family around me.

01:07:32.952 --> 01:07:34.163
I fucking made one!

01:07:34.164 --> 01:07:37.716
I made one, I pushed them right out, man!

01:07:37.717 --> 01:07:39.924
- [MARC] Babe, where are the kids?

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:41.175
- They're fine.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.880
- [MARC] Where are they?

01:07:44.881 --> 01:07:46.131
- They're fine.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.206
Why are you crying?

01:07:50.207 --> 01:07:52.571
You don't get to cry.

01:07:52.572 --> 01:07:54.190
You don't get to cry.

01:07:54.191 --> 01:07:57.191
- [MARC] Just leave her alone, okay?

01:07:58.632 --> 01:08:01.609
- [ALIS] If you're gonna
shoot me, just shoot me.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.443
- Are you kidding me?

01:08:02.443 --> 01:08:03.276
- If you're gonna kill me, just kill me.

01:08:03.277 --> 01:08:05.170
Honestly, just do it.
- Just leave her alone.

01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:06.067
- [CYBIL] God, Alis, don't say that.

01:08:06.067 --> 01:08:06.988
Don't say that.

01:08:06.989 --> 01:08:08.015
Please don't say that.

01:08:08.016 --> 01:08:09.849
- [MARC] Alis, please.

01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:12.685
- And it's back to Alis.

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:16.298
Wow.

01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:17.390
Did you see how she did that?

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.540
That was amazing.

01:08:18.541 --> 01:08:20.743
Were you taught that, or
were you just born that way?

01:08:20.743 --> 01:08:21.921
- [ALIS] Look, I don't want
you to hurt my friends.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.786
- [SILA] Do us all a favor,

01:08:23.787 --> 01:08:27.694
and put your gigantic
fucking Ph.D mouth shut,

01:08:27.696 --> 01:08:28.647
I'm not kidding you.

01:08:28.648 --> 01:08:29.919
- [ALIS] I'm not scared of her.

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.117
If she's gonna do it, she's gonna do it.

01:08:32.118 --> 01:08:33.529
- Please put the gun
down, stop pointing it!

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:34.363
- Shut up!

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:36.520
- Stop pointing it.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.417
- [SILA] What, do you care about her?

01:08:38.419 --> 01:08:40.408
What, do you care about her?

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.447
What, are you really worried about her?

01:08:42.448 --> 01:08:44.611
Don't call me Sila.

01:08:44.612 --> 01:08:47.095
- [MARC] What do you want me to call you?

01:08:47.095 --> 01:08:50.242
- [SILA] What do you call me, hon?

01:08:50.243 --> 01:08:52.326
- [MARC] I call you babe.

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:59.300
- Why does he love you?

01:09:02.653 --> 01:09:04.403
What is it about her?

01:09:06.192 --> 01:09:08.524
What is it about her, honey?

01:09:10.751 --> 01:09:12.417
He loves your brain.

01:09:14.098 --> 01:09:16.598
I was a teacher, but you, wow.

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:22.139
So tell me, if he loves your brain,

01:09:23.795 --> 01:09:25.545
why does he fuck you?

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:29.098
Are you wearing panties right now?

01:09:29.099 --> 01:09:30.834
- [ALIS] Fuck you.
- Leave her alone.

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:32.488
- [SILA] Oh, God.

01:09:32.488 --> 01:09:33.783
Are you kidding?

01:09:33.785 --> 01:09:35.379
This is not a good mother!

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.964
This is not a good woman!
- She is a good mother.

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:38.225
Leave her the fuck alone!

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:39.059
- Oh my God.

01:09:39.059 --> 01:09:39.892
I have seen her.

01:09:39.892 --> 01:09:40.725
I have seen you.

01:09:40.725 --> 01:09:42.413
I've seen you fucking,

01:09:42.415 --> 01:09:44.935
I've seen you shopping for furniture,

01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:47.603
I've seen you shopping for wine.

01:09:48.606 --> 01:09:50.947
Picking up my kids,

01:09:50.948 --> 01:09:53.189
playing house with my fucking children,

01:09:53.191 --> 01:09:56.119
when you can't even take care of your own.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.164
What kind of woman does that?

01:09:57.165 --> 01:09:59.729
I would never let my kids go like that.

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:00.563
If I could do it, I...

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.821
Whatever it is that she does, I can do it.

01:10:01.822 --> 01:10:03.346
- Stop, come on, we have a daughter.

01:10:03.347 --> 01:10:04.968
- [SILA] I can do it, I can do it, I know.

01:10:04.969 --> 01:10:06.219
I know, I know.

01:10:07.554 --> 01:10:08.583
- [MARC] The boys.

01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:09.785
- [SILA] They're fine.

01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:11.067
- [MARC] Where are they?

01:10:11.068 --> 01:10:14.703
- They're with the stupid
babysitter you hired.

01:10:14.704 --> 01:10:15.821
- Babe?

01:10:15.822 --> 01:10:17.632
They're okay?

01:10:17.633 --> 01:10:19.020
- Didn't you already ask me that,

01:10:19.021 --> 01:10:20.938
and didn't I answer it?

01:10:23.696 --> 01:10:26.340
Do you have any idea what it's like

01:10:26.341 --> 01:10:30.258
to hang up from a Skype
call with your husband,

01:10:32.629 --> 01:10:33.744
run and use the bathroom real quick,

01:10:33.745 --> 01:10:34.896
come back into the room,

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:38.564
and see some woman walk
into his hotel room?

01:10:40.347 --> 01:10:43.269
And just pull up her skirt,

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:45.520
bend over, and, no panties.

01:10:48.407 --> 01:10:49.240
And, ha.

01:10:52.116 --> 01:10:52.949
Right?

01:10:58.862 --> 01:11:01.936
- Why didn't you turn it off?

01:11:01.937 --> 01:11:03.604
What made you watch?

01:11:04.913 --> 01:11:07.515
- [MARC] Alis, please.

01:11:07.516 --> 01:11:09.683
- 'Cause I wanted to know.

01:11:13.193 --> 01:11:15.276
It was like a trainwreck.

01:11:16.674 --> 01:11:17.924
You can't stop.

01:11:22.004 --> 01:11:24.171
I didn't want to kill her.

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:27.382
- [TOMAS] No, don't. Don't.
- [WOMAN] Please don't!

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.731
- [MARC] Sila, Sila, put
the gun down, please.

01:11:28.732 --> 01:11:29.565
- [VINEKE] Kill who?

01:11:29.566 --> 01:11:30.823
- [MARC] Please, what
do you want me to do?

01:11:30.824 --> 01:11:31.850
What do you want...

01:11:31.851 --> 01:11:33.048
- I didn't want to kill her.

01:11:33.049 --> 01:11:36.716
- [MARC] Sila, Sila,
what do you want to do?

01:11:44.086 --> 01:11:46.586
- Why'd she have to be a girl?

it never comes true,

01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:07.937

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:27.077
- [MARC] Well, you don't
wanna think about that.

01:23:27.078 --> 01:23:29.109
Or if you did, it's would be probably not

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:31.007
anywhere near as bad as it would be.

01:23:31.008 --> 01:23:32.116
- [TOMAS] But you should, right?

01:23:32.117 --> 01:23:32.950
You should think about it.

01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:34.001
- [MARC] Yeah, that would make sense.

01:23:34.002 --> 01:23:36.574
- [TOMAS] In fact, what if,

01:23:36.575 --> 01:23:39.125
I think they should make
you get divorced first.

01:23:39.126 --> 01:23:41.490
(LAUGHTER)

01:23:41.491 --> 01:23:42.943
- [MARC] Wow.
- [TOMAS] And then,

01:23:42.944 --> 01:23:45.002
if you can get through that,

01:23:45.003 --> 01:23:47.791
then you can, then you can get married.

01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:48.930
Then they'll give you a license.

01:23:48.931 --> 01:23:50.741
- [MARC] Oh, yeah.

01:23:50.742 --> 01:23:53.885
Like, that's, you should
write a book about that.

01:23:53.886 --> 01:23:55.216
That's, that's quite a theory.

01:23:55.217 --> 01:23:56.732
- Or flip it on its head.

01:23:56.733 --> 01:23:58.743
Like, who's that person gonna become

01:23:58.744 --> 01:24:01.494
when you're like, happy and shit?

01:24:02.531 --> 01:24:03.731
- [TOMAS] But you didn't.

01:24:03.732 --> 01:24:06.050
Nobody would have anticipated this, right?

01:24:06.051 --> 01:24:07.583
- Mm-mm. No.

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:08.835
- Like, you didn't know,

01:24:08.836 --> 01:24:11.164
you don't know who the fuck your wife is.

01:24:11.165 --> 01:24:11.998
- No. No.

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:14.271
- Oh, I mean, I guess
you guys are divorced.

01:24:14.272 --> 01:24:16.643
- Yeah, but I don't know
who the fuck I am right now.

01:24:16.644 --> 01:24:17.668
I mean...

01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:19.090
- I don't know who the fuck you are,

01:24:19.091 --> 01:24:20.424
but here we are.

01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:22.691
- What are you gonna do?

01:24:22.692 --> 01:24:24.227
- I don't know.

01:24:24.228 --> 01:24:25.895
- I could marry you.

01:24:27.368 --> 01:24:28.943
- You're proposing to me?

01:24:28.944 --> 01:24:32.085
- He bought an extra plane
ticket for Sam to come with me,

01:24:32.086 --> 01:24:35.073
which I thought was a
little out of character,

01:24:35.074 --> 01:24:37.544
but I was pleasantly surprised.

01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:40.068
And then I fucking get to the airport,

01:24:40.069 --> 01:24:42.189
and he's called the fucking cops,

01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:44.544
and he's claiming that
I'm trying to kidnap her.

01:24:44.545 --> 01:24:46.710
- Let's see, hold on.

01:24:46.711 --> 01:24:48.500
- [CYBIL] Maybe we can get
you an internet divorce.

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:50.217
- Get a divorce first,

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:52.227
and then, and then...
- Get a divorce first.

01:24:52.228 --> 01:24:53.691
And if you do that,
- And based on...

01:24:53.692 --> 01:24:54.738
- If you survive it,

01:24:54.739 --> 01:24:56.477
if you're cool...

01:24:56.478 --> 01:24:58.530
- But what does surviving mean?

01:24:58.531 --> 01:24:59.614
- Oh, I mean.

01:25:00.465 --> 01:25:02.094
- Like, literally surviving.

01:25:02.095 --> 01:25:03.414
- Like, literally.

01:25:03.415 --> 01:25:05.482
- Like if you don't get shot.

01:25:05.483 --> 01:25:07.114
- Uh, that's a little too soon.

01:25:07.115 --> 01:25:08.023
- All right.

01:25:08.023 --> 01:25:08.856
Oh, yeah.

01:25:08.857 --> 01:25:10.856
Sorry. Sorry about that.

01:25:11.954 --> 01:25:13.764
That was fucking,

01:25:13.765 --> 01:25:14.983
that was wow.

01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:16.786
- Yeah, I mean, I get it.

01:25:16.787 --> 01:25:20.954
I'd fucking love to shoot the
woman who my husband is with.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:25.859
- That is an unpredictable,
unconventional,

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.420
outside of the box way

01:25:27.421 --> 01:25:30.504
to jail people together for weddings.

01:25:31.722 --> 01:25:34.305
- You know, she broke my heart.

01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:37.940
- Yeah, she broke mine too.

01:25:39.744 --> 01:25:41.568
Just, just don't tell her.

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:43.652
You'll get me in trouble.

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:47.270
- I won't get you in trouble.

01:25:47.271 --> 01:25:48.771
You're a good guy.

01:25:51.589 --> 01:25:53.756
- Yeah, so are you, Tomas.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.667
Thanks for, uh...

01:26:02.148 --> 01:26:02.981
Well.

01:26:03.961 --> 01:26:06.378
Here's to, uh...
- Good guys.

01:26:07.779 --> 01:26:10.178
- To what?
- Good guys.

01:26:10.179 --> 01:26:11.320
- Here's to good guys.

01:26:11.321 --> 01:26:12.534
- Here's to good guys.

01:26:12.535 --> 01:26:14.084
- Here's to good guys!

01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:15.331
- Here's to good guys!

01:26:15.332 --> 01:26:16.352
- Good guys.

01:26:16.353 --> 01:26:17.353
- Good guys.

01:26:19.773 --> 01:26:21.705
Eh, they're not listening.

01:26:21.706 --> 01:26:23.456
- Never did.
- Mm-hm.

01:26:24.715 --> 01:26:27.189
- [IKE] I just became a minister online.

01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:31.193
I literally just became a minister online.

01:26:31.194 --> 01:26:32.277
- I miss you.

01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:35.829
- Well, I miss you!

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:39.021
- It's like, I want to
go to sleep, but I can't.

01:26:39.022 --> 01:26:40.380
You know what I mean?

01:26:40.381 --> 01:26:41.464
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:42.433 --> 01:26:45.166
- Well, because the nightmares suck.

01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:46.080
- You having nightmares?

01:26:46.081 --> 01:26:47.196
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:47.197 --> 01:26:48.201
- Pussy.

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:51.240
(LAUGHTER)

01:26:51.241 --> 01:26:55.260
- I got, I got four
letters for you, soldier.

01:26:55.261 --> 01:26:56.844
P-T-S-D, all right?

01:26:57.759 --> 01:26:59.714
So don't...
- Ooh, ooh, he's throwing out

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:01.320
the big words now.

01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:02.904
- The big acronyms.

01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:05.283
- Well, you don't die,

01:27:05.284 --> 01:27:06.772
because you wake up, hopefully.

01:27:06.773 --> 01:27:07.923
And right about that time...

01:27:07.924 --> 01:27:08.757
- Yeah, well, yeah.

01:27:08.758 --> 01:27:11.974
When you wake up, and
(TAKES A DEEP BREATH)

01:27:11.975 --> 01:27:14.892
It's why you get up in the morning.

01:27:18.292 --> 01:27:19.542
- To good guys.

01:27:20.878 --> 01:27:22.711
- Where are they? I...

01:27:24.181 --> 01:27:25.303
- Am I a good guy?

01:27:25.304 --> 01:27:27.887
Am I in this, am I in the club?

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.999
- (SCREAMING)

01:27:48.524 --> 01:27:50.037
- [MAN] A shooting
range around the corner.

01:27:50.038 --> 01:27:53.205
What kind of sick cosmic crap is that?

01:27:55.825 --> 01:27:58.575
- [IKE] Tomas, this is your game!

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.595
- Sam's with your mother.

01:28:16.248 --> 01:28:18.367
- Is my mom coming to the wedding?

01:28:18.368 --> 01:28:19.201
- No. No.

01:28:20.676 --> 01:28:25.092
She wasn't invited, but she's
gonna bring Sam tomorrow.

01:28:25.093 --> 01:28:25.957
- She what?

01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:29.096
- She's gonna bring Sam tomorrow.

01:28:29.097 --> 01:28:32.680
You can hide her, or
whatever it is you do.

01:28:40.261 --> 01:28:42.336
- That's how I do.
- [MARC] All day.

01:28:42.337 --> 01:28:43.170
- All day.

01:28:43.170 --> 01:28:44.122
- [CYBIL] I can do it all day!

01:28:44.123 --> 01:28:45.260
- All day!

01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:47.009
- [TOMAS] We're all nuts.

01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:49.343
(SPLASHING)

01:28:53.353 --> 01:28:55.514
- [ALIS] Yeah, I guess.

01:28:55.515 --> 01:28:56.956
- No, you did.

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:59.707
It was, so a guy runs into a bar,

01:29:00.688 --> 01:29:02.464
asking, or screaming,

01:29:02.465 --> 01:29:05.072
"Does anyone own a six-foot penguin,"

01:29:05.073 --> 01:29:06.309
"does anyone own a six-foot penguin?"

01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:07.310
- I'm sorry about Marc.

01:29:07.311 --> 01:29:10.198
- Bartender and all the
patrons are like, "No, why?"

01:29:10.199 --> 01:29:12.638
Guy says, "I think I might
have just hit a nun."

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.144
(LAUGHING)

01:29:14.145 --> 01:29:15.569
- Oh, no.

01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:18.297
- [MARC] Oh, no. That's such nun-sense.

01:29:18.298 --> 01:29:19.629
- [MAN] Oh, you did not.

01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:20.463
- [FELICE] I did it!

01:29:20.463 --> 01:29:21.328
- [MARIA] Oh, yes you did.

01:29:21.329 --> 01:29:23.828
- You know, when Sam was born,

01:29:27.187 --> 01:29:29.169
she looked at me,

01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:31.420
and I looked at you, and...

01:29:38.747 --> 01:29:42.080
I'll never forget the look on your face.

01:29:47.724 --> 01:29:50.057
(SPLASHING)

01:29:55.994 --> 01:29:58.744
(MUFFLED SPEECH)

01:30:25.816 --> 01:30:27.983
- [ALIS] See you in court.

01:30:30.566 --> 01:30:32.816
- [TOMAS] See you in court.

01:30:36.827 --> 01:30:37.910

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:43.518
(EVERYONE SPEAKS AT ONCE)

01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:49.827
- Be here now, Alis, come on!

01:30:49.828 --> 01:30:53.745
- [FELICE] I can feel
the relief wash over you!

01:30:56.204 --> 01:31:00.121
- Now, all we need is
good old Tomas to get in.

01:31:01.334 --> 01:31:03.084
- [ALL] Tomas, Tomas!

01:31:05.186 --> 01:31:06.354
- Here he comes!

01:31:06.355 --> 01:31:08.612
- [FELICE] Here he comes.

01:31:08.613 --> 01:31:09.835
- [IKE] Yes!

01:31:09.836 --> 01:31:11.753
- [MAN] Oh, oh. Oh, oh.

01:31:12.996 --> 01:31:14.614
- [FELICE] Tomas is at the diving board.

01:31:14.615 --> 01:31:16.865
(SHOUTING)

01:31:23.386 --> 01:31:24.291

01:31:24.292 --> 01:31:25.536
It's a stand-off,

01:31:25.537 --> 01:31:28.152
who is gonna get in here first?

01:31:28.153 --> 01:31:30.357
(SHOUTING)

01:31:30.358 --> 01:31:32.244
Oh, oh, all right.

01:31:32.245 --> 01:31:33.605
All right.
- [TOMAS] Maybe.

01:31:33.606 --> 01:31:34.675
- [IKE] Come on, buddy.

01:31:34.676 --> 01:31:35.509
- On three.

01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:36.944
- [IKE] All right, oh shit.

01:31:36.945 --> 01:31:38.945
