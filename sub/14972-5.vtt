WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:03.169
It was murder.

00:03.171 --> 00:04.270
You don't know that.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.755
Yeah, we do.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.239
Somebody took it after
she was already dead.

00:07.242 --> 00:08.592
Why are you here?

00:08.593 --> 00:09.943
Same reason as you.
I got plans out there.

00:09.945 --> 00:10.855
I can't.

00:10.856 --> 00:11.766
You want to find your daughter.

00:11.767 --> 00:12.677
I want to find my sister,
Sheema.

00:12.681 --> 00:13.680
If we hit that plant
hard enough...

00:13.682 --> 00:14.447
It's too great a risk.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.015
We have to try!

00:16.017 --> 00:18.851
What if there was another way
to get into the building.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.287
She was alive after I died.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.022
She made it out.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.073
How is your face, Susan?

00:24.074 --> 00:25.123
Forget about my face.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.292
This is my way of saying,
thank you.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.294
We got to get my people
someplace safe.

00:28.296 --> 00:31.464
Don't leave me...please.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.032
You let them in here?!

00:33.034 --> 00:34.367
You should have
left them out there.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.701
Yeah, instead we left her.

00:37.639 --> 00:38.471
Take her!

00:38.473 --> 00:39.205
( gunfire )

00:39.207 --> 00:41.441
( snarling and growling )

00:50.719 --> 01:02.962
( vampires growling )

01:06.801 --> 01:10.703
They fear her.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.972
She could change us.

01:12.974 --> 01:15.808
( speaking Romanian )

01:15.810 --> 01:18.645
Truth or not, she will lead me
to Rebecca.

01:18.647 --> 01:21.981
Rebecca will lead me to Dmitri.

01:21.983 --> 01:23.716
Then I'll remove his head.

01:30.592 --> 01:32.992
Your prize.

01:32.994 --> 01:34.761
( feral growling )

01:34.763 --> 01:36.229
Not much of one.

01:54.916 --> 01:58.584
( whispers ) What are you?

02:00.855 --> 02:03.056
( sniffing )

02:09.931 --> 02:12.832
I should bite you.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.101
Good idea.

02:15.103 --> 02:16.836
Go for it.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.682
That's right, you know
you want a taste.

02:46.868 --> 02:51.571
If she is our death,
she is valuable.

02:51.573 --> 02:54.474
But if not...

02:54.476 --> 02:56.376
A test.

02:57.379 --> 02:59.812
A test!

02:59.814 --> 03:02.315
Aaaaagh!!!!

03:02.317 --> 03:05.351
( vampires join in )

03:24.839 --> 03:26.873
Uh... excuse me.

03:30.178 --> 03:33.012
( speaking Romanian )

03:33.014 --> 03:35.915
It's... it's Dr. Sholomenko.

03:35.917 --> 03:37.650
Come forward.

03:40.755 --> 03:44.023
Don't be frightened, doctor.

03:44.025 --> 03:45.958
Dmitri...

03:45.960 --> 03:47.927
Have you met my sister?

03:47.929 --> 03:49.695
Antanasia.

03:49.697 --> 03:53.099
She's a bit of a recluse,
only comes out to feed.

03:53.101 --> 03:56.102
And to play, of course.

03:56.104 --> 03:58.871
After living for 300 years,

03:58.873 --> 04:02.775
I've learned it is not enough
to merely exist.

04:02.777 --> 04:05.678
One must enjoy the simple
pleasures of life.

04:08.116 --> 04:12.518
But you gain no sustenance
from this, correct?

04:12.520 --> 04:15.188
Mmm.

04:15.190 --> 04:17.190
So pure.

04:17.192 --> 04:19.358
So sweet.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.429
A message from Julius camp.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.132
The woman absolutely exists.

04:26.134 --> 04:28.534
It said she turned one of them.

04:28.536 --> 04:32.438
There are even reports
Julius has already captured her.

04:36.711 --> 04:40.112
Would you like me to send
a response?

04:43.051 --> 04:47.720
The key to ruling successfully,
my dear doctor,

04:47.722 --> 04:52.058
is by saying much by saying
so very little.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.295
Go now. Go!

05:00.335 --> 05:04.136
Slowly, my dear, slowly.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.874
We have all the time
in the world.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.828
I want you to keep an eye
on these guys

05:28.830 --> 05:29.495
while I'm gone, alright?

05:32.834 --> 05:34.667
Hey.

05:34.669 --> 05:35.424
Hey!

05:35.425 --> 05:36.180
Yo!

05:36.181 --> 05:36.936
Put the food back
on the shelf!

05:36.938 --> 05:37.937
They're hungry.

05:37.939 --> 05:39.739
Right now!

05:42.944 --> 05:45.778
Thank you for letting us in.

05:45.780 --> 05:46.612
If it weren't for you-

05:46.614 --> 05:48.514
It wasn't.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.515
I lost someone important
out there because of you.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.950
Vanessa.

05:50.952 --> 05:52.151
Yeah.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.351
She saved some good people.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.120
She's a hero.

05:54.122 --> 05:56.622
She was stupid.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.024
Her death won't be in vain.

05:58.026 --> 06:00.092
Nobody said she's dead.

06:05.266 --> 06:06.332
Give me that.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.549
It's a goddamn bus station
out there.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.184
Well, get used to it.

06:25.186 --> 06:27.620
This one has several broken
ribs, a punctured lung,

06:27.622 --> 06:29.355
what looks like
internal bleeding.

06:29.357 --> 06:31.791
It'll be at least a month
before he goes anywhere.

06:31.793 --> 06:33.392
Come on.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.628
You know we're gonna run out
of food, right?

06:35.630 --> 06:38.631
I'll try and find some more
while I'm out there.

06:38.633 --> 06:39.632
I gotta find her, Doc.

06:39.634 --> 06:40.299
I thought you
understood that.

06:40.301 --> 06:42.301
What I understand is them.

06:42.303 --> 06:43.202
What happens
when they find out

06:43.204 --> 06:47.473
that they're living
with a murderer?

06:47.475 --> 06:49.809
You gotta stop pretending
like that's not our reality.

06:49.811 --> 06:51.644
I'm not pretending.

06:51.646 --> 06:52.578
Then it never crossed
your mind?

06:52.580 --> 06:53.713
What do you want me to do?

06:53.714 --> 06:54.847
You want me to go out there and
tell them "Hey, you know what?

06:54.848 --> 06:55.981
You should all watch
your backs

06:55.984 --> 06:59.151
'cause there's a murderer in
here" right before I take off?

07:05.960 --> 07:08.661
Can I help you?

07:08.663 --> 07:10.796
You going somewhere?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.164
That's none of your business,
pal.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.733
Ok.

07:13.735 --> 07:15.735
How's Roger doing?

07:15.737 --> 07:17.503
I put him under to ease
the pain,

07:17.505 --> 07:20.740
but when he wakes up
he's on his own.

07:20.742 --> 07:21.674
It's gonna hurt like hell,

07:21.676 --> 07:24.910
but we can't spare
any more analgesic.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.512
I understand.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.913
Really, do you?

07:30.685 --> 07:32.018
What's that mean?

07:32.020 --> 07:33.002
It means ever
since you got here

07:33.003 --> 07:33.985
I've seen nothing
but a free-for-all.

07:33.988 --> 07:38.090
If you don't step in,
I will.

07:38.092 --> 07:40.426
A lot of people got excited.

07:40.428 --> 07:44.430
We haven't seen a stock of food
like that in a long time and...

07:44.432 --> 07:46.599
it felt safe.

07:46.601 --> 07:49.368
I promise, from now on we
get what you ration us.

07:49.370 --> 07:51.003
Nothing more.

08:07.455 --> 08:09.855
You sure about this?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.524
Drinking water only until
we get a heavy rain.

08:11.526 --> 08:13.359
No showers.

08:13.361 --> 08:15.695
It is gonna get ripe in here
with all those people.

08:15.697 --> 08:18.764
Yeah, well, if they don't like
it they're welcome to leave.

08:20.802 --> 08:25.304
You blame me for bringing
them here, don't you?

08:25.306 --> 08:26.772
What did you expect her
to do?

08:26.774 --> 08:28.641
Let them die?

08:28.643 --> 08:30.443
If it meant her coming back.

08:30.445 --> 08:32.278
( grunts )
Yeah.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.249
What I don't know is what this
place is gonna look like

08:36.250 --> 08:37.450
when I do bring
her back.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.053
Look, you don't even know
where they're taking her-

08:41.055 --> 08:42.054
Hey, I got this.

08:42.056 --> 08:42.888
I got this.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.223
Why don't you go check
the uh...

08:44.225 --> 08:45.825
reservoir on the roof?

08:45.827 --> 08:47.460
Ok?

08:48.162 --> 08:51.797
Kid.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.966
You steal the codes out of
my notebook again,

08:53.968 --> 08:55.134
I'm gonna chuck you
off that roof.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.635
You got me?

08:59.741 --> 09:01.874
Yes sir.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.818
Who is brave enough?

09:12.820 --> 09:14.720
( vampires hissing )

09:28.669 --> 09:34.240
Fear.. this human.

09:36.511 --> 09:40.179
I am not afraid.

09:40.181 --> 09:42.414
( snarls )

09:54.128 --> 09:56.862
She's nothing.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.533
Just a freak.

10:00.535 --> 10:02.601
Always was.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.040
Susan?

10:12.480 --> 10:14.980
Friends.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.882
Better.

10:31.966 --> 10:33.232
I don't want to hurt you.

10:33.234 --> 10:36.735
You were a real bitch.

10:36.737 --> 10:42.141
Like your little girl, right
before I DRAINED HER!

10:43.411 --> 10:46.412
( cries out angrily )

10:46.414 --> 10:48.747
( glass shatters )

10:48.749 --> 10:51.016
Pathetic!

10:51.018 --> 10:52.318
If you laid a hand on her-

10:52.320 --> 10:54.486
I'll do the same to you!

10:54.488 --> 10:57.056
( roars )

11:01.095 --> 11:03.729
( hisses )

11:19.580 --> 11:20.512
( bone snaps )

11:25.353 --> 11:28.520
( sets bone )

11:28.522 --> 11:30.122
She called for you.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.691
Over and over.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.426
Shut your mouth!

11:34.428 --> 11:35.694
So sweet.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.297
So young.

11:38.299 --> 11:40.532
So trusting.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.533
( groans )

11:54.982 --> 11:58.784
( screams )

12:43.030 --> 12:44.697
Come on!

12:44.699 --> 12:45.931
Who's next?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.266
It's true.

12:47.268 --> 12:47.800
Huh?

12:47.802 --> 12:49.201
Who's next?

12:51.105 --> 12:53.439
Who's next?

12:54.942 --> 12:57.109
( whispers ) Get ready to run.

12:58.679 --> 13:01.013
Want some?

13:01.015 --> 13:03.082
You want some?

13:03.784 --> 13:04.783
Now!

13:07.221 --> 13:08.187
Go!

13:09.123 --> 13:11.357
( growling )

13:17.631 --> 13:21.533
( growling )

13:27.808 --> 13:28.807
( shrieks )

13:32.646 --> 13:36.582
Find her, or it's your head!

13:36.584 --> 13:40.386
ALL OF YOUR HEADS!

13:40.388 --> 13:41.887
GOOOO!

13:46.894 --> 13:48.827
How did you do this?

13:49.397 --> 13:51.330
Vanessa, how are you
still alive?

13:51.332 --> 13:53.232
It doesn't matter.

13:53.234 --> 13:55.901
Just tell me what happened
to Dylan.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.002
No, I'm sorry.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.238
No, what I said in there,
it isn't true.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.739
About Dylan.

14:00.741 --> 14:01.573
What?

14:01.575 --> 14:03.509
I didn't kill her.

14:03.511 --> 14:05.244
That was the vampire
in me being a bitch.

14:05.246 --> 14:08.180
I didn't- I didn't kill her.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.683
Is she alive?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.752
What happened to her?

14:15.523 --> 14:18.590
( feral screeching )

14:18.592 --> 14:19.992
Leave me here.

14:19.994 --> 14:21.760
I deserve it.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.436
Which way?

14:30.438 --> 14:31.336
Come on.

14:54.862 --> 14:58.330
( gasping )

15:47.815 --> 15:49.314
( loud thud )

16:10.838 --> 16:13.238
( hissing )

16:18.112 --> 16:20.646
( snarls )

16:30.858 --> 16:33.692
Now I have you.

16:37.431 --> 16:40.532
You don't have to kill me.

16:40.534 --> 16:44.603
I'm sure I'm not the first
human to say this, but...

16:48.375 --> 16:50.142
You were the one in the walls.

16:50.144 --> 16:52.778
Watching me.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.616
I remember your scent.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.956
( gasps )

17:07.628 --> 17:09.628
Please, I can be useful.

17:09.630 --> 17:11.196
Anything you need,
I can get it.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.631
Please.

17:12.633 --> 17:17.569
I have everything I need.

17:17.571 --> 17:23.809
Maybe I... feed you
to my pets.

17:23.811 --> 17:28.146
Or maybe I...
experiment on you.

17:30.918 --> 17:33.652
Or...

17:38.559 --> 17:40.158
Go...

17:43.063 --> 17:44.830
Go!!!

17:52.840 --> 17:57.576
Never to say I can't
be merciful.

18:00.614 --> 18:02.914
( hiss )

18:29.143 --> 18:30.409
Where now?

18:30.411 --> 18:31.443
This way.

18:39.486 --> 18:43.622
The food's good for now, but
our biggest problem is uh...

18:43.624 --> 18:46.224
the reservoir is almost
bone dry.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.592
But it should rain eventually.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.959
It is Seattle, right?

18:55.736 --> 18:59.538
Sam, what are they saying?

19:11.652 --> 19:13.352
Hey, come on.

19:13.354 --> 19:17.022
I don't trust that guy.

19:17.024 --> 19:18.990
Do you?

19:31.939 --> 19:34.339
Hard to read them.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.741
Shhh.

19:37.378 --> 19:41.880
They're whispering.

19:41.882 --> 19:43.515
Try.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.393
Uh, don't feel safe.

19:54.395 --> 19:57.529
Why do we have to leave?

19:59.967 --> 20:03.635
Thought we... going
to find the resi-

20:03.637 --> 20:05.570
resistance?

20:05.572 --> 20:06.405
Yeah, the resistance.

20:06.407 --> 20:07.472
Resistance?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.207
Yeah, heard of 'em.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.077
Some kind of
human-lead uprising

20:12.079 --> 20:13.712
to fight back or whatever.

20:13.714 --> 20:14.479
Horse shit.

20:16.917 --> 20:17.582
The water's shut off.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.251
Yeah, I know.

20:19.253 --> 20:19.918
Why?

20:19.920 --> 20:21.820
Guess.

20:21.822 --> 20:26.158
Hey, what're you
all talking about?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.993
Your little meeting
you're having over here.

20:27.995 --> 20:30.328
What's this all about?

20:30.330 --> 20:34.065
If I wanted you to know,
you would.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.168
Ok, well we got a new rule.

20:36.170 --> 20:38.837
There's no secrets in
my house.

20:38.839 --> 20:40.505
Look, we appreciate
your hospitality-

20:40.507 --> 20:42.307
( dishes clattering )

20:42.309 --> 20:45.076
But I'm gonna conduct meetings
with my people as I see fit.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.077
Now, if you got a problem
with that-

20:46.079 --> 20:48.880
Oh, I definitely got a
problem with that.

20:49.817 --> 20:51.750
( gasps )

20:51.752 --> 20:52.984
Axel!

21:08.368 --> 21:10.001
Jesus Christ!

21:11.038 --> 21:12.737
Uh...

21:15.542 --> 21:16.708
What the heck
is going on?

21:16.710 --> 21:17.943
He's dead.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.119
What happened?

21:28.121 --> 21:28.670
You told me he was-

21:28.671 --> 21:29.220
He bled out.

21:29.223 --> 21:29.688
I'm- I'm sorry.

21:29.690 --> 21:30.956
He bled out?

21:30.958 --> 21:32.341
How?

21:32.342 --> 21:33.725
We should get the body
down the chute.

21:33.727 --> 21:34.559
Down the chute?

21:34.561 --> 21:35.727
The garbage chute.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.295
What?!

21:37.297 --> 21:38.363
We're not doing that.

21:38.365 --> 21:39.598
Then you go outside
and dig a grave.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.868
It's how we dispose of
our dead.

21:42.870 --> 21:43.452
It's nothing personal-

21:43.453 --> 21:44.035
It's hygienic.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.438
That's all.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.372
Ok, fine.

21:47.374 --> 21:47.973
I'll take care of it.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.941
Is there anything else?

21:49.943 --> 21:51.109
No.

21:51.111 --> 21:51.877
Woah, woah!

21:51.879 --> 21:53.778
I think there is.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.553
You need to look at this.

22:04.458 --> 22:06.057
What the?!

22:11.665 --> 22:14.633
Somebody say something!

22:14.635 --> 22:16.735
One of ours was killed
before you got here.

22:16.737 --> 22:20.372
Whoever did it took a finger
just like this.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.342
You kept that from us?

22:24.344 --> 22:27.679
A murderer?

22:27.681 --> 22:30.916
I made a judgement call to
avoid panic in an overpopulated,

22:30.918 --> 22:32.584
confined environment.

22:32.586 --> 22:34.986
I can control my people.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.154
Clearly you can't.

22:36.156 --> 22:37.389
His blood is on your hands.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.895
You prepared, asshole?

22:43.897 --> 22:46.231
For the giant mess
you just made?

22:46.233 --> 22:47.399
They had a right to know.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.407
Well, I know I didn't kill him.

22:55.409 --> 22:57.342
Well, we can all say that.

22:57.344 --> 22:58.343
Yeah, and one of us would
be lying.

22:58.345 --> 23:00.178
It's obvious why he was killed.

23:00.180 --> 23:01.846
He's the reason why
they were staying.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.950
Dead, they leave.

23:04.952 --> 23:06.284
That shows motive.

23:06.286 --> 23:07.903
But with Cynthia,
that seems personal.

23:07.904 --> 23:09.521
Look, we gotta focus on what's
right in front of us right now.

23:09.523 --> 23:12.524
This situation is going down
the toilet fast.

23:12.526 --> 23:13.858
Now what are they doing?

23:15.762 --> 23:19.197
What is John doing with them?

23:19.199 --> 23:20.765
Son of a bitch.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.037
Hey!

23:28.642 --> 23:30.042
Hey!

23:30.043 --> 23:31.443
What'd I tell you about
your little meetings?

23:31.445 --> 23:32.777
Hey!

23:35.048 --> 23:36.881
What's with the map, John?

23:36.883 --> 23:37.882
( chuckles )

23:37.884 --> 23:39.784
They're just trying
to figure out

23:39.785 --> 23:41.685
how hard it would be to take
over this place.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.456
You learn a thing or two
in an apocalypse!

23:44.458 --> 23:46.791
Don't you dare move!

23:46.793 --> 23:49.961
It turns out it's easier
than we thought.

23:49.963 --> 23:51.463
Sorry, Axel.

23:51.465 --> 23:54.299
Hey, that rhymes with "asshole".

23:54.301 --> 23:56.635
I just realized that.

24:17.691 --> 24:19.424
This is only temporary
until we find out

24:19.426 --> 24:21.493
who the real killer is.

24:21.495 --> 24:25.096
It's for your safety
as much as ours.

24:25.098 --> 24:26.431
What's the point of
having a refuge

24:26.433 --> 24:27.599
if it's no safer outside, right?

24:27.601 --> 24:31.202
Oh, so you're protecting
us now, that's it?

24:31.204 --> 24:32.937
That's bullshit.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.440
You saw something good
and you took it.

24:35.442 --> 24:37.942
I'll tell you what.
You can have it.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.177
You give me my gear, you
send me out the front door.

24:39.179 --> 24:41.346
( laughs )

24:41.348 --> 24:41.980
I can't do that.

24:41.981 --> 24:42.613
Sure you can. Why not?

24:42.616 --> 24:44.449
You got what you wanted.

24:44.451 --> 24:46.451
Put me out there.

24:46.453 --> 24:47.903
Send me out the front door.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.354
We let you out, you sneak
back in here two days later,

24:49.356 --> 24:51.189
kill us all in our sleep.

24:51.191 --> 24:52.190
Fu   you, John!

24:58.298 --> 24:59.197
You did the right thing.

24:59.199 --> 25:00.999
It could be any one of them.

25:08.475 --> 25:09.774
Come on, man. Don't do this.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.711
Don't leave me in here.

25:12.713 --> 25:15.814
Don't leave me in here!

25:15.816 --> 25:17.849
Hey! Hey!

25:20.821 --> 25:21.436
How could you?

25:21.437 --> 25:22.052
Huh?

25:22.055 --> 25:22.721
Woah, woah, no.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.289
Easy, easy.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.224
Don't put this all on me!

25:26.226 --> 25:29.561
I just told them what
they deserved to know!

25:29.563 --> 25:34.232
That one of you is the killer.

25:34.234 --> 25:36.401
And who absolved you?

25:36.403 --> 25:39.037
I know it wasn't me,
which makes it one of you.

25:39.039 --> 25:42.540
What you did out there,
betraying us?

25:42.542 --> 25:44.142
You know that makes you look
guilty as hell.

25:44.144 --> 25:47.145
Yeah, sure does.

25:47.147 --> 25:49.197
Any one of us is
capable of it,

25:49.198 --> 25:51.248
but only one of us took off
right after Cynthia was killed.

25:51.251 --> 25:52.150
Me?

25:52.152 --> 25:54.252
You think I killed them?

25:54.254 --> 25:55.270
Yeah, why not?

25:55.271 --> 25:56.287
No one else died 'til you
got back!

25:58.925 --> 25:59.924
Are you serious?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.259
<i> He's right.</i>

26:01.261 --> 26:03.428
What?

26:03.430 --> 26:04.996
Timing.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.164
Where were you when Roger
was killed, huh?

26:06.166 --> 26:08.166
I was on the roof top trying
to check the reservoir

26:08.168 --> 26:09.501
just like Axel asked.

26:09.503 --> 26:12.670
I can vouch for that.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.773
Anybody go with you?

26:14.775 --> 26:19.344
I- I think we might be
overlooking someone here.

26:19.346 --> 26:23.348
He used to be one of those...
things, right?

26:23.350 --> 26:24.961
Christ, you came in here
to kill us all.

26:24.962 --> 26:26.573
Who's to say you're not
still carrying

26:26.574 --> 26:28.185
some residual psycho
killer in you, huh?

26:28.188 --> 26:30.188
You have been struggling
with the transition.

26:30.190 --> 26:32.157
Sleepwalking, nightmares-

26:32.159 --> 26:33.875
Oh, come on!

26:33.876 --> 26:35.592
I wasn't even in the lab today!

26:35.595 --> 26:37.996
Are you sure?

26:37.998 --> 26:42.100
Or was I?

26:42.102 --> 26:46.204
Maybe.

26:46.206 --> 26:47.438
No, that's not possible.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.706
That's not who I am.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.774
That's not who I am anymore.

26:49.776 --> 26:50.341
That's not who I am anymore.

26:50.343 --> 26:51.342
I'm not a killer!

26:51.343 --> 26:52.342
I know who I am!

26:52.345 --> 26:53.228
I know who I am!

26:53.229 --> 26:54.112
Calm down.

26:54.114 --> 26:55.280
Jesus, why is that,
soldier boy?

26:55.282 --> 26:56.365
What do you care?

26:56.366 --> 26:57.449
You were just about
to ditch out on us!

26:57.450 --> 26:58.533
Leave us here to rot!

26:58.534 --> 26:59.617
You need to get out of my face
right now!

26:59.619 --> 27:01.219
Hey!

27:01.221 --> 27:02.053
No, no, no.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.043
Hey!

27:03.044 --> 27:04.032
Stop!

27:04.033 --> 27:05.021
Stop! Enough!

27:05.025 --> 27:07.025
This is what they want, right?

27:07.026 --> 27:09.026
They want us to be fighting,
they want us to yap

27:09.029 --> 27:09.894
about who did what to who.

27:09.896 --> 27:10.628
It doesn't matter.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.796
It's not our issue right now.

27:11.798 --> 27:15.366
We have to stick together
until we get outta here.

27:34.054 --> 27:38.489
There's a sewer over there,
I think we can get out that way.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.824
I've heard stories.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.659
What stories?

27:41.661 --> 27:44.062
Let's just stay it's doubtful
we'll be followed.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.236
I've always admired you.

27:51.238 --> 27:53.071
Your courage.

27:53.073 --> 27:55.406
Pretty girls like us always
gotta put up with shit

27:55.408 --> 27:57.742
and you had the balls to do
something about it.

28:00.580 --> 28:01.846
Is that it there?

28:01.848 --> 28:03.181
Yeah.

28:03.183 --> 28:06.084
( feral howls )

28:06.086 --> 28:07.685
We lost our lead!

28:07.687 --> 28:08.920
( howling )

28:08.922 --> 28:12.657
( hissing )

28:12.659 --> 28:16.094
( howling )

28:16.096 --> 28:19.430
We go down there,
we're probably gonna die.

28:19.432 --> 28:20.815
Go, go, go!

28:20.816 --> 28:22.199
( snarling )

28:22.202 --> 28:23.268
( screaming )

28:26.873 --> 28:28.606
It's not coming in.

28:28.608 --> 28:29.841
( snarling )

28:29.843 --> 28:32.277
We are the only ones
crazy enough.

28:32.279 --> 28:33.411
Let's go!

28:35.248 --> 28:36.014
Get back!

28:39.119 --> 28:41.152
( growling )

28:47.694 --> 28:49.694
This way. Come on.

28:52.866 --> 28:54.332
Shit!

28:56.202 --> 28:57.201
We gotta go!

28:57.203 --> 28:58.770
We gotta go now.

29:10.550 --> 29:12.050
Follow.

29:12.052 --> 29:13.518
Bring her to me.

29:24.564 --> 29:26.965
You choose death?

29:26.967 --> 29:30.001
( screech )

29:30.003 --> 29:32.070
Down there humans will die.

29:37.310 --> 29:38.977
She's no human.

30:15.882 --> 30:20.184
Fresh meat to the one who
brings her to me.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.121
( howls )

30:33.867 --> 30:36.534
( howls )

30:58.324 --> 31:00.124
( snarls )

31:22.682 --> 31:25.750
( whispering )

31:25.752 --> 31:28.586
I take it you're not here
to let us out?

31:28.588 --> 31:31.255
Actually I am.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.925
Hear me out.

31:33.927 --> 31:37.595
I think we could hear a lot
better outside this cage.

31:37.597 --> 31:39.931
Look, we spent a lot of time
discussing what to do with you,

31:39.933 --> 31:44.001
and... we've come to
an agreement.

31:44.003 --> 31:44.936
None of us are innocent.

31:44.938 --> 31:47.038
We all have blood
on our hands.

31:47.040 --> 31:51.943
While one of you...
killing for pleasure?

31:51.945 --> 31:54.445
We have no other choice
but to exile all of you.

31:54.447 --> 31:55.346
Are you serious?

31:55.348 --> 31:56.280
That's insane.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.448
I'm not going anywhere!

31:57.450 --> 31:58.182
We'll die out there.

32:00.854 --> 32:01.953
Brendan, you can't do this.

32:01.955 --> 32:03.454
We can and we will.

32:03.456 --> 32:06.624
The decision has been made.

32:06.626 --> 32:07.692
Ok, listen to me.

32:07.694 --> 32:08.392
I did it.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.460
Axel, don't-

32:09.462 --> 32:12.563
Send me out there.

32:12.565 --> 32:13.064
I'm confessing to you.

32:13.066 --> 32:14.299
I'm the one.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.533
I did it.

32:15.535 --> 32:16.000
I did it.

32:16.001 --> 32:16.466
Send me out there.

32:16.469 --> 32:18.970
It was me.

32:18.972 --> 32:20.204
Come on.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.472
I did it.

32:21.474 --> 32:23.374
I don't believe you.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.177
I did.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.049
Because I did, Sam.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.385
I killed those people.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.991
When we left Vanessa outside
I was pissed and I wanted

32:39.993 --> 32:43.161
you out of here so I thought
if Roger was dead

32:43.163 --> 32:44.829
you'd be scared and have
no reason to stay.

32:44.831 --> 32:46.564
And the girl, Cynthia?

32:46.566 --> 32:48.466
She was weak.

32:48.468 --> 32:49.634
We're only as strong as our
weakest link,

32:49.635 --> 32:50.801
you said it yourself.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.070
None of us are innocent.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.405
You killed Roger?

32:54.407 --> 32:57.742
Yeah, and after I took his
finger as a souvenir.

32:57.744 --> 33:01.345
Look, kid, you don't have
to do this.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.214
Fine.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.082
Put your hands in the air
and move forward slowly.

33:14.594 --> 33:15.760
Take me.

33:15.762 --> 33:17.929
I killer.

33:17.931 --> 33:19.430
I killer!

33:19.432 --> 33:19.997
Sam!

33:19.999 --> 33:20.998
Sam, Sam, Sam!

33:21.000 --> 33:25.336
Listen, I'll be ok.

33:25.338 --> 33:26.837
I'll see you soon.

33:26.839 --> 33:29.941
I promise.

33:29.943 --> 33:30.408
Friends.

33:30.410 --> 33:31.676
Yes, we are.

33:31.678 --> 33:32.343
But they need you.

34:01.374 --> 34:04.542
Ok. I'm ready.

34:04.544 --> 34:05.510
Good.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.477
Move forward slowly.

34:06.478 --> 34:07.444
The rest of you back up.

34:07.447 --> 34:09.714
Move back!

34:09.716 --> 34:11.449
Back up!

34:20.727 --> 34:22.126
You're gonna get what's
coming to you, kid.

34:22.128 --> 34:25.229
Axel, do something.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.399
Don't worry about me, guys.

34:28.401 --> 34:30.968
I've survived out there before.

34:30.970 --> 34:33.371
I'll do it again.

34:43.149 --> 34:54.492
( cries out )

35:04.070 --> 35:05.436
It's impossible.

35:05.438 --> 35:08.406
And yet there it is.

35:08.408 --> 35:09.106
But how?

35:09.108 --> 35:10.174
The citadel is well guarded-

35:10.176 --> 35:12.610
I told you, I'm a tunnel rat.

35:12.612 --> 35:16.681
There's a network of service
tunnels under that building.

35:16.683 --> 35:18.683
We break in through here
and we're up and in

35:18.685 --> 35:22.987
without them even knowing.

35:22.989 --> 35:25.589
And you thought I was just
some kid.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.158
I never said that.

35:31.931 --> 35:33.397
So how's the rest of
this gonna work?

35:41.874 --> 35:43.407
I smell the bitch.

35:47.113 --> 35:48.512
She's close.

35:52.352 --> 35:53.951
( snarls )

35:58.291 --> 35:59.557
What was that?

35:59.559 --> 36:01.692
I don't know.

36:04.964 --> 36:09.133
I don't hear it anymore.

36:09.135 --> 36:11.135
Let's keep going.

36:15.408 --> 36:19.210
( growling )

36:28.221 --> 36:31.389
Wasn't him.

36:31.391 --> 36:37.395
I seen the eyes of a killer
and it sure wasn't that kid.

36:37.397 --> 36:41.899
It's not your fault.

36:41.901 --> 36:47.905
I saw the whole thing coming,
just got too fixated on...

36:47.907 --> 36:51.976
On Vanessa.

36:51.978 --> 36:55.579
Doesn't matter now.

36:55.581 --> 36:59.650
Hindsight's anchor will
drown us all eventually.

36:59.652 --> 37:01.519
These people will make
sure of that.

37:01.521 --> 37:04.755
The hell are you taking about?

37:04.757 --> 37:07.658
This won't stop at Mohamad.

37:11.764 --> 37:24.909
( vampires hissing )

37:27.680 --> 37:28.779
You have anything to say,
Spartacus?

37:28.781 --> 37:30.080
What?

37:30.082 --> 37:32.683
I'm calling you a liar.

37:32.685 --> 37:33.684
If you-

37:33.686 --> 37:34.936
if you think I didn't do it

37:34.937 --> 37:36.187
then why are you
kicking me out?

37:36.189 --> 37:40.858
The way I see it, if
I've got to thin the herd

37:40.860 --> 37:45.763
until I get it right in order to
protect my people so be it.

37:45.765 --> 37:46.630
At least release my friends.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.165
They're good people.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.699
Your friends are not your
concern anymore.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.535
You're getting off easy.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.470
Yeah?

37:52.472 --> 37:54.004
Well, so are you.

37:58.110 --> 38:02.947
You're seriously gonna let me go
out there without any weapons?

38:02.949 --> 38:04.181
Go!

38:20.066 --> 38:21.198
( door slams )

38:23.803 --> 38:26.804
( growling )

38:26.806 --> 38:28.205
Shit.

38:43.556 --> 38:45.589
It should have been me.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.157
At ease, soldier man.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.492
They're never gonna let us
out of here,

38:48.494 --> 38:51.996
even with that death stare
of yours.

38:51.998 --> 38:53.898
I just let an innocent kid walk
to his death because of you.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.099
Innocent?

38:55.101 --> 38:56.600
He confessed.

38:56.602 --> 39:00.104
He did it to save us.

39:00.106 --> 39:00.938
Jesus.

39:00.940 --> 39:02.273
Don't be naive.

39:02.274 --> 39:03.607
The world's a war zone.

39:03.609 --> 39:04.675
There's casualties in war.

39:04.677 --> 39:06.176
Yeah, you mean like Wendy.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.013
Hey.

39:09.015 --> 39:10.014
The hell?

39:10.016 --> 39:11.749
Yeah, maybe so.

39:11.751 --> 39:13.117
All I know is there's two
people out there

39:13.119 --> 39:15.686
who you want to save but can't.

39:15.688 --> 39:19.356
Now maybe you know
what it feels like.

39:19.358 --> 39:25.362
If it wasn't Mohamad that means
the killer is still among us.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.031
Right here.

39:27.033 --> 39:30.367
So what do we do now?

39:30.369 --> 39:34.104
We get outta here.

39:34.106 --> 39:36.774
And we take it all back.

39:45.618 --> 39:49.386
( gasping )

39:54.894 --> 39:57.728
I need to rest.

39:57.730 --> 39:59.964
You're ok.

40:03.903 --> 40:07.071
But only for a minute, because
we need to keep moving.

40:07.073 --> 40:08.739
Thank you.

40:09.008 --> 40:10.374
Oh, shit!

40:21.320 --> 40:25.889
Susan, do you remember
what happened to Dylan?

40:33.833 --> 40:36.166
Dylan came to my door.

40:36.168 --> 40:38.936
She was covered in blood.

40:38.938 --> 40:40.270
Your blood.

40:40.272 --> 40:45.109
She was so afraid she could
barely speak.

40:45.111 --> 40:48.178
What'd she say?

40:48.180 --> 40:55.019
She said someone broke into
your apartment and attacked you.

40:55.021 --> 40:58.455
But she watched you die.

40:58.457 --> 40:59.356
I brought her in my apartment,

40:59.358 --> 41:03.193
I locked the door
and called 911.

41:03.195 --> 41:07.031
While we waited for the cops
we called her dad.

41:07.033 --> 41:10.634
Did he come get her?

41:10.636 --> 41:11.802
Please, I need to know.

41:11.804 --> 41:13.504
Did he come and get her?

41:13.505 --> 41:15.205
Did he take her to Denver?

41:15.207 --> 41:19.710
He- He said he was coming.

41:19.712 --> 41:23.614
The cops took her away, so...

41:23.616 --> 41:26.884
I tried to find out what
happened to her, I swear I did.

41:26.886 --> 41:31.789
But then...

41:31.791 --> 41:35.192
You were turned?

41:35.194 --> 41:37.061
I'm so sorry Vanessa.

41:37.063 --> 41:39.129
Shh. It's ok.

41:39.131 --> 41:40.230
I'm so...

41:40.232 --> 41:42.366
Shh. It's ok.

41:56.649 --> 41:58.315
You.

41:58.317 --> 42:00.651
You were the mysterious girl
Julius was after

42:00.653 --> 42:02.653
this whole time.

42:02.655 --> 42:06.156
( laughs )

42:06.158 --> 42:07.558
Shit.

42:15.067 --> 42:17.034
Oh god.

42:22.742 --> 42:23.240
What was that?

42:23.242 --> 42:25.909
Stay calm.

42:25.911 --> 42:28.145
I can't see anything.

42:29.148 --> 42:31.248
I can.

42:31.851 --> 42:35.185
What do we do?

42:35.187 --> 42:36.487
Run!!!!
