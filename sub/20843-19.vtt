00:02.071 --> 00:05.444
‐ Announcer: <i>Previously...</i>
‐ Three, two, one.

00:05.444 --> 00:07.816
Dino, baby doll, go!

00:07.816 --> 00:10.254
Four are cooking,
one's standing, staring.

00:10.254 --> 00:12.324
Announcer:
<i>It was a race</i>
<i>against the clock.</i>

00:12.324 --> 00:15.632
He's got barely
20 minutes to cook.

00:15.632 --> 00:18.470
‐ Announcer:
<i>But for Yachecia...</i>
‐ ( spits )

00:18.470 --> 00:21.677
‐ <i>...and Jeff...</i>
‐ The salmon's raw.

00:21.677 --> 00:24.850
<i>...the time ran out.</i>

00:24.850 --> 00:29.793
<i>Tonight,</i>
<i>the finale is just</i>

00:29.793 --> 00:31.329
<i>three pressure tests away.</i>

00:32.632 --> 00:35.672
<i>And with</i>
<i>the end in sight...</i>

00:35.672 --> 00:38.310
We are raising
the stakes tonight.

00:38.310 --> 00:40.180
<i>...whose MasterChef dream...</i>

00:40.180 --> 00:41.750
It needs to go
in the oven.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.988
‐ <i>...will rise...</i>
‐ ( Bleep ). Come on, move!

00:43.988 --> 00:45.357
‐ <i>...and fall?</i>
‐ ( bleep )

00:45.357 --> 00:46.392
This is it.

00:46.392 --> 00:47.829
‐ ( sniffles )
‐ You okay?

00:47.829 --> 00:50.535
‐ I did a bad job.
‐ It's do or die.

00:50.535 --> 00:53.507
‐ It looks awful.
‐ To be eliminated now
would be crushing.

00:53.507 --> 00:54.610
( sobs )

01:05.565 --> 01:07.134
Hi.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.638
Gordon:
<i>Welcome, guys.</i>

01:08.638 --> 01:11.009
When I first came here,
I was just a ballet dancer

01:11.009 --> 01:14.883
<i>and now I'm</i>
<i>in the top four best home cooks</i>
<i>in America, baby.</i>

01:14.883 --> 01:18.991
You have no idea
how hard it was to get here.

01:18.991 --> 01:21.730
I have some really tough
competitors.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.335
You talented four,
make your way down
to the front.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.372
‐ Thank you.
‐ Jason: It's so dark
in here.

01:26.372 --> 01:28.343
Jason's a music teacher.

01:28.343 --> 01:31.884
<i>To see him translate</i>
<i>the music into food</i>

01:31.884 --> 01:34.255
is beautiful.
Jason's an artist on a plate.

01:34.255 --> 01:36.092
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐ Oh, my God.

01:36.092 --> 01:37.729
You know what this is.

01:37.729 --> 01:41.135
Eboni, baby doll.
She's been down in the dirt,

01:41.135 --> 01:43.473
gotten her ass kicked.
She's been through it all.

01:43.473 --> 01:45.878
<i>But being from that type</i>
<i>of lifestyle‐‐</i>

01:45.878 --> 01:48.216
<i>street smart and book smart</i>
<i>at the same time,</i>

01:48.216 --> 01:49.553
<i>it's made her very talented.</i>

01:49.553 --> 01:51.222
‐ Welcome back.
‐ ( sighs )

01:51.222 --> 01:52.726
Dino:
<i>And then there's Cate.</i>

01:52.726 --> 01:55.163
<i>She's been a front‐runner</i>
<i>in so many of these challenges.</i>

01:55.163 --> 01:58.838
She has been consistently
good since day one,

01:58.838 --> 02:00.508
and she's only
been getting better.

02:00.508 --> 02:03.681
Honestly, she's probably
the person I'm worried
about the most.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.221
We are raising
the stakes tonight.

02:07.221 --> 02:10.595
One of you will go home
empty‐handed.

02:10.595 --> 02:11.797
( exhales )

02:11.797 --> 02:14.936
The other three of you
will be headed

02:14.936 --> 02:19.278
straight
for the "MasterChef" finale.

02:19.278 --> 02:20.915
Aarón:
This is gonna work
a little differently

02:20.915 --> 02:22.251
than you guys are used to

02:22.251 --> 02:23.754
because more than
one challenge

02:23.754 --> 02:25.625
will take place
in this kitchen tonight.

02:25.625 --> 02:29.131
You're about to face
a series of skills tests

02:29.131 --> 02:32.004
and your aim
is to get yourself safe

02:32.004 --> 02:35.645
and into the finale
as quickly as possible.

02:35.645 --> 02:38.016
To survive tonight,
you're going to have
to conquer

02:38.016 --> 02:42.257
one of the world's
most versatile ingredients.

02:42.257 --> 02:44.863
‐ It's the all‐around...
‐ All‐star...

02:44.863 --> 02:46.967
All‐purpose...

02:50.473 --> 02:53.479
‐ flour.
‐ ( all laugh )

02:53.479 --> 02:56.553
Flour is
the foundation for more
dishes than you can count.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.389
To make it
to the "MasterChef" finale,

02:58.389 --> 03:00.327
you are going
to have to show us

03:00.327 --> 03:03.834
that you can create
MasterChef‐worthy masterpieces

03:03.834 --> 03:06.105
using flour.

03:08.777 --> 03:11.115
Flour.
You could do so many things‐‐

03:11.115 --> 03:14.623
<i>dumplings, pasta, pastries,</i>
<i>fruit tarts.</i>

03:14.623 --> 03:16.827
I'm almost certain I'm gonna
be good at whatever this is.

03:16.827 --> 03:19.599
Flour's a cheap ingredient,
and I use that a lot at home.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.941
Christina:
<i>Home cooks...</i>

03:25.778 --> 03:29.953
your first battle
for survival will involve
all four of you home cooks.

03:31.322 --> 03:33.627
Four of you will cook
at these stations.

03:33.627 --> 03:37.669
And from here,
one of you will be made safe.

03:37.669 --> 03:42.912
The other three will be left
standing on the firing line.

03:42.912 --> 03:45.584
Facing another challenge.

03:45.584 --> 03:47.087
Aarón's scaring me.

03:47.087 --> 03:49.526
From the three that battle
at these stations,

03:49.526 --> 03:51.930
one of you
will be victorious

03:51.930 --> 03:54.903
and take their place
in the finale.

03:54.903 --> 03:59.111
The other two will face
the scary, intimidating...

03:59.111 --> 04:01.349
Final challenge.

04:01.349 --> 04:04.054
If you still haven't
made it to safety,

04:04.054 --> 04:06.994
your shot at becoming
America's next MasterChef

04:06.994 --> 04:10.568
will all be on the line
right here.

04:10.568 --> 04:12.304
Two of you will then
go head‐to‐head

04:12.304 --> 04:15.076
in a straight
all‐or‐nothing fight.

04:15.076 --> 04:18.182
One will take a place
in the "MasterChef" finale,

04:18.182 --> 04:21.757
the other will walk out
of those doors with nothing.

04:24.495 --> 04:27.434
All four of you,
follow me.

04:29.004 --> 04:30.841
I need to get
on the balcony first

04:30.841 --> 04:34.783
because each skills test
is only gonna get harder
and harder

04:34.783 --> 04:38.189
and my odds of going home
are only gonna increase

04:38.189 --> 04:39.358
if I stay down here.

04:39.358 --> 04:42.297
<i>I just need to execute</i>
<i>and be quick.</i>

04:42.297 --> 04:45.203
Today's all about speed.

04:45.203 --> 04:50.113
For your first flour challenge,
you'll be tackling a dessert.

04:50.113 --> 04:54.288
An elevated treat
that requires so much finesse,

04:54.288 --> 04:57.795
it takes some of the best chefs
years to master.

04:57.795 --> 05:01.402
This is flour
at its finest...

05:01.402 --> 05:03.740
‐ profiteroles.
‐ Mm.

05:03.740 --> 05:06.278
Christina:
Each with an exquisite
chocolate ganache

05:06.278 --> 05:09.051
<i>and a beautiful</i>
<i>pastry cream filling.</i>

05:09.051 --> 05:11.590
You'll have 45 minutes
to make us a plate

05:11.590 --> 05:15.598
of three profiteroles
identical to these.

05:15.598 --> 05:17.902
The home cook
who impresses us the most

05:17.902 --> 05:19.404
will be sent up
to the balcony

05:19.404 --> 05:22.310
and will claim their spot
in the finale.

05:22.310 --> 05:25.918
The three who are not safe
have some serious trouble ahead

05:25.918 --> 05:29.592
because the next challenge
is not pretty.

05:30.594 --> 05:33.934
Please head
to your stations.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.673
Profiteroles are something
that I've worked with before.

05:36.673 --> 05:39.946
<i>I know some tricks</i>
<i>to make the cream puffs</i>
<i>a little better.</i>

05:39.946 --> 05:44.989
I think these profiteroles
could be my winning ticket
to the finale.

05:44.989 --> 05:47.194
At your stations,
you'll have everything
that you need

05:47.194 --> 05:49.599
to make us three
stunning profiteroles‐‐

05:49.599 --> 05:52.838
<i>eggs, butter, salt, sugar,</i>
<i>chocolate,</i>

05:52.838 --> 05:55.678
heavy cream,
and, of course, flour.

05:56.947 --> 06:00.386
Your 45 minutes starts...

06:00.386 --> 06:01.790
‐ now.
‐ ( clock ticks )

06:09.338 --> 06:11.810
All right, guys,
so looking at these
four competitors‐‐

06:11.810 --> 06:14.849
<i>Eboni, Cate, Jason,</i>
<i>and Dino.</i>

06:14.849 --> 06:18.590
‐ Who really has
those pastry chops?
‐ Dino.

06:18.590 --> 06:21.362
Cannolis, breads,
desserts, Dino has nailed.

06:21.362 --> 06:23.165
Dino:
<i>I need to be on that balcony.</i>

06:23.165 --> 06:25.303
I need to make it up there
because I want to live

06:25.303 --> 06:27.508
that food dream one day
of opening up that pastry shop,

06:27.508 --> 06:30.313
so everything's at stake
for me right now in this
challenge.

06:30.313 --> 06:32.217
Eboni's been very strong
on these desserts.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.354
‐ <i>Chocolate soufflé.</i>
‐ Ah!

06:34.354 --> 06:37.695
‐ Gordon:
<i>Cate, a great technician.</i>
‐ That's good.

06:37.695 --> 06:40.199
The weakest one
across the desserts
right now tonight

06:40.199 --> 06:42.738
is Jason.

06:42.738 --> 06:45.209
Aarón:
Absolutely, Jason gets
too caught in his own head.

06:45.209 --> 06:47.648
‐ He wants to deviate
from the recipe...
‐ He does want to deviate.

06:47.648 --> 06:49.184
...and he wants to do
what he wants to do.

06:52.892 --> 06:57.067
Christina:
45 minutes to make three
stunning, perfect profiteroles.

06:57.067 --> 06:59.605
Now, profiteroles start with
that pate a choux pastry‐‐

06:59.605 --> 07:04.549
water, flour, sugar, salt,
butter in a saucepan.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.886
Cook out the starch.

07:06.886 --> 07:08.456
Into the stand mixer,

07:08.456 --> 07:11.495
add four eggs until
that batter is smooth

07:11.495 --> 07:15.069
and ready to pipe
onto a sheet tray
in perfect rounds.

07:15.069 --> 07:19.478
The pastry dough needs
to be in the oven within
the first 10, 12 minutes max

07:19.478 --> 07:24.221
because they're gonna
take 22 to 24 minutes
in the oven at 425.

07:24.221 --> 07:26.893
Gordon:
Ten minutes gone,
35 minutes to go.

07:26.893 --> 07:29.732
They have got to be
in the oven

07:29.732 --> 07:31.669
in the next
two to three minutes.

07:31.669 --> 07:34.007
Otherwise, you're gonna
be in trouble to fill them.

07:34.007 --> 07:35.343
Ah!

07:35.343 --> 07:37.046
Gordon:
We have these
professional trays

07:37.046 --> 07:39.451
that have the circumference,
the spacing.

07:39.451 --> 07:42.290
Jason hasn't followed
those lines,

07:42.290 --> 07:43.927
so they're not
even evenly piped.

07:43.927 --> 07:46.031
‐ I said earlier,
he'll go off‐piste.
‐ Yep.

07:51.375 --> 07:53.780
Christina:
Cate's dollops
are quite small.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.249
She needs a little bit
more down there.

07:57.287 --> 07:59.926
Gordon: Speed up.
Get that choux pastry
in the oven.

07:59.926 --> 08:02.698
You have to move, Dino.

08:05.036 --> 08:07.942
Jason's in the oven,
Eboni's in the oven,
Dino's in the oven.

08:07.942 --> 08:11.716
Cate is the only one now
who hasn't got her sheet pastry
in the oven.

08:13.587 --> 08:15.724
How are they gonna
cool down?

08:15.724 --> 08:18.897
They're gonna
be soggy balls
of pastry cream.

08:18.897 --> 08:21.536
‐ ( exhales )
‐ Christina:
27 minutes to go.

08:21.536 --> 08:23.773
‐ Gordon: Get them in the oven.
‐ Christina: Gotta get them
in the oven, Cate.

08:23.773 --> 08:24.775
Yes.

08:32.625 --> 08:35.096
Cristina:
27 minutes to go.

08:35.096 --> 08:36.633
Gotta get 'em
in the oven, Cate.

08:36.633 --> 08:37.835
Yes.

08:37.835 --> 08:40.807
They're gonna be soggy balls
of pastry cream.

08:44.481 --> 08:45.918
‐ Cate.
‐ Yes, Chef?

08:45.918 --> 08:47.688
You were the last
in the oven.
Why?

08:47.688 --> 08:49.959
I'd rather be perfect
on the technique

08:49.959 --> 08:53.465
instead of rushing it
and having it flawed at the end.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.938
You understand
they have to cool down
before you start piping.

08:55.938 --> 08:57.440
Yes, Chef.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.146
‐ What size
have you gone for?
‐ Small.

09:00.146 --> 09:03.954
23 and a half minutes
to get yourself onto
the balcony...

09:03.954 --> 09:05.156
I'm gonna do it, Chef.

09:05.156 --> 09:07.327
...and in the finale
of "MasterChef."

09:07.327 --> 09:10.166
Thank you, Chef.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.669
Christina :
The next thing you do
at this point

09:11.669 --> 09:14.942
is get going
on those ganaches.

09:14.942 --> 09:17.648
Dino's adding
cold heavy cream
to his ganache.

09:17.648 --> 09:20.587
Cold heavy cream
will separate
that mixture.

09:20.587 --> 09:23.359
Jason is using these
small little saucepans

09:23.359 --> 09:25.162
to make his ganache,
direct heat.

09:25.162 --> 09:29.872
He needs to be very delicate
or it's gonna burn.

09:29.872 --> 09:32.310
Keeps seizing up.
I don't know what the hell's
wrong with it.

09:32.310 --> 09:35.282
Eboni's milk
chocolate ganache
is on high heat,

09:35.282 --> 09:38.823
so much so that
the water bath underneath
is starting to boil up.

09:38.823 --> 09:41.796
You don't want water
or condensation in your ganache.

09:41.796 --> 09:46.371
A touch of water inside
that chocolate can destroy
the ganache.

09:46.371 --> 09:48.710
Game over.

09:48.710 --> 09:51.181
No, see?
It's too hard.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.421
Home cooks,
last ten minutes.

09:56.693 --> 09:57.761
‐ Jason?
‐ Yes, Chef.

09:57.761 --> 09:59.765
So you prefer to make
your ganaches in the pot

09:59.765 --> 10:01.669
as opposed
to a double boiler, why?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.441
I just‐‐ I think
I have a good handle
on the temperature.

10:04.441 --> 10:06.411
I'm not gonna have it
overheat and separate,

10:06.411 --> 10:08.783
and this way I can
make sure that the chocolate
is fully melted,

10:08.783 --> 10:10.854
and that way I won't have
problems if water gets in it

10:10.854 --> 10:12.256
and it seizes,
or things like that.

10:12.256 --> 10:15.129
‐ All right, Jason,
good luck.
‐ Thank you.

10:15.129 --> 10:17.701
This one is
( bleep ) separating.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.210
‐ Miss Eboni.
‐ Yes, Chef?

10:22.210 --> 10:23.646
How's it going?

10:23.646 --> 10:25.984
That milk chocolate's
separating. I'm gonna
redo it real quick.

10:25.984 --> 10:28.288
Only one minor setback.
That'll be all right.

10:28.288 --> 10:29.959
You seem very calm,
very focused,

10:29.959 --> 10:32.463
‐ very in control.
‐ I've come this far, right?

10:32.463 --> 10:34.400
I've been gone away
from my kids for how long?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.104
And if I go home
on a dessert,

10:36.104 --> 10:38.142
something I love to do,
come on, now.

10:38.142 --> 10:39.745
All right, good luck.
Keep your eye on that
ganache.

10:39.745 --> 10:42.116
Thank you.

10:42.116 --> 10:44.487
Gordon:
Jason's taking his
out of the oven now.

10:44.487 --> 10:45.824
Wow.

10:45.824 --> 10:48.428
Dino's out of the oven.

10:48.428 --> 10:51.702
Fan them down.
Fan them down, do something.
Get them cold.

10:51.702 --> 10:54.340
‐ Christina: Less than
five minutes to go, guys.
‐ Ow!

10:54.340 --> 10:57.714
‐ Christina: Come on.
‐ Cate: Finally.

10:57.714 --> 11:01.221
Aarón:
Make sure that your glaze
is immaculate.

11:01.221 --> 11:03.760
Christina:
Make sure it's just
the right consistency.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.634
Gordon:
60 seconds remaining.
This is it.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.139
‐ Aarón: Finesse.
‐ Gordon:
Glaze them beautifully.

11:10.139 --> 11:14.782
Three profiteroles
good enough to get you
into the finale.

11:16.484 --> 11:20.092
‐ Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine, eight, seven,

11:20.092 --> 11:23.800
six, five, four, three,

11:23.800 --> 11:26.471
‐ two, one.
‐ Stop!

11:26.471 --> 11:30.981
‐ Hands in the air.
‐ Hands in the air.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.622
All right, home cooks,
very carefully please bring
those profiteroles forward.

11:35.991 --> 11:37.728
Jason:
<i>I think that</i>
<i>I've done a decent job,</i>

11:37.728 --> 11:39.632
but the more I'm looking
at my profiteroles,

11:39.632 --> 11:42.303
the more all these wild thoughts
are running through my head.

11:42.303 --> 11:44.140
<i>Have I filled</i>
<i>the profiteroles properly?</i>

11:44.140 --> 11:46.044
<i>Is the white chocolate glaze</i>
<i>the right consistency?</i>

11:46.044 --> 11:49.652
I'm just hoping
that I've done enough
to get me into the finale.

11:49.652 --> 11:51.989
Christina:
It's time to find out
whose profiteroles

11:51.989 --> 11:55.730
are MasterChef finale‐worthy.

11:57.366 --> 11:59.872
Jason, those glazes,
how did they go?

11:59.872 --> 12:01.374
Jason:
<i>I think I did all right.</i>

12:01.374 --> 12:04.113
<i>I know my ganache techniques</i>
<i>may be a little unconventional.</i>

12:04.113 --> 12:06.151
<i>I just put things</i>
<i>directly into the pan,</i>

12:06.151 --> 12:08.990
just trying to control
that temperature.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.994
Nice and baked
on every side.

12:10.994 --> 12:12.965
Nice glaze.

12:12.965 --> 12:14.802
But the white chocolate
is a little bit thinner, huh?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.237
Yes.

12:16.237 --> 12:17.908
If it's too warm,
it's gonna be thinner,

12:17.908 --> 12:19.210
which will have it
droop down.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.916
Temperature plays a role
in this ganache.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.653
How much filling am I
gonna get on the inside?

12:23.653 --> 12:25.155
It should
be filled completely.

12:28.863 --> 12:30.099
( gasps )

12:30.099 --> 12:31.736
You've managed
to get pastry cream

12:31.736 --> 12:33.405
in every nook and cranny,
which is impressive.

12:37.279 --> 12:38.616
Nice flavor.

12:38.616 --> 12:40.520
Do you think
those profiteroles
were good enough

12:40.520 --> 12:42.691
to get you
into the finale?

12:42.691 --> 12:43.793
I'm really hoping.

12:48.736 --> 12:51.107
Okay, Eboni.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.946
<i>Visually, you've got</i>
<i>three consistent sizes</i>

12:53.946 --> 12:56.752
<i>and great color</i>
<i>on the profiteroles.</i>

12:56.752 --> 13:01.361
However you've got an issue
with the white chocolate.

13:01.361 --> 13:03.766
It just kept seizing.
Every time I was trying

13:03.766 --> 13:05.703
to slow cook it down,
it melted.

13:05.703 --> 13:07.841
White chocolate was just
not my friend today.

13:07.841 --> 13:10.947
‐ Yeah, it looks grainy,
it's sort of all runny...
‐ Yes, Chef.

13:10.947 --> 13:12.049
...and sort of
not pleasant.

13:12.049 --> 13:14.788
The filling?

13:14.788 --> 13:16.124
Beautiful.

13:16.124 --> 13:19.130
How's it taste?

13:19.130 --> 13:21.602
‐ It tastes amazing.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

13:21.602 --> 13:23.873
So, great size,
the filling, beautiful.

13:23.873 --> 13:27.547
Unfortunately, visually,
it looks awful.

13:27.547 --> 13:28.916
Thank you.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.730
‐ Dino, how did you do?
‐ Pretty good.

13:35.730 --> 13:38.301
<i>I think the ganache glaze</i>
<i>is good on these two.</i>

13:38.301 --> 13:39.638
<i>That one could use</i>
<i>a little bit of work.</i>

13:39.638 --> 13:41.675
‐ The dark chocolate, you mean.
‐ The dark chocolate, yeah.

13:41.675 --> 13:44.147
It looks grainy.
It doesn't look smooth,

13:44.147 --> 13:46.284
it doesn't have that sheen,
I think you know that.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.621
Yes, Chef.

13:47.621 --> 13:48.789
Did you heat your milk
before you added it?

13:48.789 --> 13:51.494
I didn't.

13:51.494 --> 13:53.431
Okay.

13:53.431 --> 13:55.202
Let's see
what we have inside.

14:01.414 --> 14:02.617
Beautifully filled.

14:07.894 --> 14:11.835
Delicious.
I think the profiterole
itself is baked properly.

14:11.835 --> 14:14.006
Right ratio of filling.

14:14.006 --> 14:15.342
Ganache is a touch grainy.

14:15.342 --> 14:17.313
<i>It hasn't been</i>
<i>smoothed out sufficiently.</i>

14:18.649 --> 14:20.820
( exhales )

14:22.791 --> 14:24.460
All right, Cate.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.801
Visually, size, shape,
consistency‐wise,

14:27.801 --> 14:29.638
<i>your profiteroles,</i>
<i>are you happy?</i>

14:29.638 --> 14:31.809
Yeah, I think they're
a little bit smaller

14:31.809 --> 14:34.514
than I'm used to making,
but I'm happy with them.

14:34.514 --> 14:36.050
Um, they are
a bit small.

14:36.050 --> 14:39.290
Smaller than
your standard profiterole.

14:39.290 --> 14:42.496
And this one
sort of looks like the top
has popped up and over.

14:42.496 --> 14:44.033
Yes, Chef.

14:44.033 --> 14:46.705
So I can start to see
some of the pastry cream
come out the side there.

14:46.705 --> 14:48.709
You filled them
from the bottom, correct?

14:48.709 --> 14:51.314
No, I filled them
from the side.

14:51.314 --> 14:54.655
You do know what
a profiterole's supposed
to look like, right?

14:54.655 --> 14:57.226
I just never‐‐
I didn't know.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.598
Okay.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.502
Let's see
about this filing.

15:04.608 --> 15:06.779
Beautifully filled.

15:10.653 --> 15:13.993
Um, you know,
it's not grainy,.
It's not‐not silky.

15:13.993 --> 15:17.499
The fat has just separated,
so the flavor is a little
disjointed there.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.738
Um, but a nice filling.

15:19.738 --> 15:21.374
‐ You okay?
‐ Cate: Yeah.

15:21.374 --> 15:23.144
Christina:
What's going on?

15:23.144 --> 15:24.548
It's okay, talk to me.

15:24.548 --> 15:28.723
I just did a bad job
and I need to...

15:28.723 --> 15:30.860
toughen up.

15:30.860 --> 15:33.231
Listen, there's a lot
on the line.

15:33.231 --> 15:34.735
It's a very
serious evening.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.437
‐ Sorry.
‐ And I know how much
you want it,

15:36.437 --> 15:39.878
and I know how hard
you've worked to be here.

15:39.878 --> 15:43.953
I know how hard
you worked last season
to try to win an apron.

15:43.953 --> 15:46.592
You're not going
straight into the finale
after this battle,

15:46.592 --> 15:49.063
but I know you're tough enough,
and I know you're a fighter.

15:49.063 --> 15:51.902
Thank you.

15:57.279 --> 15:59.885
Wrong size, wrong shape.

15:59.885 --> 16:01.889
‐ You okay, Cate?
‐ I'm good.

16:01.889 --> 16:03.425
The pressure
is getting to her.

16:03.425 --> 16:06.431
‐ Give this to her.
There goes some tissue.
‐ Thanks.

16:06.431 --> 16:09.604
Two great ones,
the size are beautiful,
very consistent.

16:09.604 --> 16:12.109
There's a lot
of understanding,
a lot of perspective.

16:12.109 --> 16:14.548
Aarón:
And no one else did that,
by the way. He nailed that.

16:14.548 --> 16:15.616
Yes.

16:17.620 --> 16:20.459
That was an intense
challenge.

16:20.459 --> 16:23.264
One of you
gave us profiteroles

16:23.264 --> 16:27.774
good enough to book yourself
a place in the finale.

16:27.774 --> 16:31.748
Three of you didn't make it
this challenge,

16:31.748 --> 16:35.121
and you'll go straight
into another battle

16:35.121 --> 16:36.457
for a place
in the finale.

16:38.629 --> 16:42.804
The first person
going into the finale is...

16:51.020 --> 16:55.195
The first person
going into the finale

16:55.195 --> 16:56.264
is...

16:59.638 --> 17:02.610
Jason.
Congratulations.

17:02.610 --> 17:04.614
( sobs )

17:04.614 --> 17:08.388
Gordon:
A near‐flawless execution.
Beautifully presented.

17:08.388 --> 17:11.227
Beautifully cooked.
How are you feeling?

17:11.227 --> 17:13.799
Ahh!
( laughs )

17:13.799 --> 17:18.676
You are the first
"MasterChef" finalist.

17:18.676 --> 17:23.151
Young man, head up
to the balcony. Amazing.

17:23.151 --> 17:25.488
Go, Jason!

17:25.488 --> 17:27.961
Never in a million years
would I have thought

17:27.961 --> 17:29.698
that I would be here
in this position.

17:29.698 --> 17:32.102
Thank you, Chefs.
Thank you, thank you.

17:32.102 --> 17:34.173
<i>I try to instill</i>
<i>in all my students</i>

17:34.173 --> 17:36.979
<i>that if you</i>
<i>believe in yourself,</i>
<i>you can achieve anything.</i>

17:36.979 --> 17:40.018
<i>And now I, Jason,</i>
<i>a high school music teacher</i>

17:40.018 --> 17:41.655
<i>from Newton,</i>
<i>Massachusetts,</i>

17:41.655 --> 17:43.859
is in the finale
of "MasterChef"!

17:43.859 --> 17:45.730
Ahh!

17:45.730 --> 17:48.034
The three of you,
follow us.

18:00.358 --> 18:03.364
This next challenge
is the holy grail

18:03.364 --> 18:05.101
of flour‐based dishes.

18:05.101 --> 18:06.605
A beautiful Latin spin

18:06.605 --> 18:10.311
on one of the most treasured
desserts in the culinary world.

18:10.311 --> 18:12.884
This is one
of the hardest dishes

18:12.884 --> 18:16.625
you'll ever have
to master.

18:16.625 --> 18:18.996
<i>Volcán de deuce de leche.</i>

18:18.996 --> 18:22.469
A Latin
molten lava cake.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.241
With a dish this elegant,
this technical,

18:25.241 --> 18:27.580
there is so much
that can go wrong.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.018
And you won't know
if you got it right

18:30.018 --> 18:34.661
until you slice into it.

18:34.661 --> 18:38.702
If you get this right,
it could land you up
on that balcony with Jason,

18:38.702 --> 18:41.340
securing a spot
in the "MasterChef" finale.

18:41.340 --> 18:44.046
If you get it wrong,
you'll have an even more

18:44.046 --> 18:46.685
difficult challenge
ahead of you.

18:46.685 --> 18:50.024
You'll have just
25 minutes

18:50.024 --> 18:55.903
to make us one "MasterChef"
finale‐worthy molten lava cake.

18:55.903 --> 18:57.272
Please head
to your stations.

18:58.274 --> 19:01.280
A molten lava cake
in 25 minutes?

19:01.280 --> 19:02.683
Are you kidding me?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.386
<i>This is impossible!</i>

19:04.386 --> 19:07.092
If I had an hour on this,
I'd probably struggle.

19:07.092 --> 19:08.829
When they said it was
gonna be a lot harder,

19:08.829 --> 19:12.202
they were not joking,
baby doll.

19:12.202 --> 19:14.406
On your stations,
you'll find everything you need

19:14.406 --> 19:18.381
to make us one amazing
Latin molten lava cake.

19:18.381 --> 19:21.888
Eboni, Dino, Cate,
are you ready?

19:21.888 --> 19:24.259
All: Yes, Chef.

19:24.259 --> 19:27.733
Your 25 minutes
starts...

19:27.733 --> 19:29.136
‐ now.
‐ ( clock ticks )

19:33.645 --> 19:35.315
All right, guys, so,
the <i>volcán de dulce de leche,</i>

19:35.315 --> 19:37.219
this is one
of the signature dishes

19:37.219 --> 19:38.755
I have in my restaurants,
and let me tell you,

19:38.755 --> 19:41.327
the degree of difficulty
is so high here.

19:41.327 --> 19:43.665
First of all,
it's a molten cake

19:43.665 --> 19:46.470
that's flavored,
instead of chocolate,
with dulce de leche.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.441
In essence, all it is
is condensed milk

19:48.441 --> 19:51.013
that's been cooked down
for three hours

19:51.013 --> 19:52.950
till it gets
to this caramel‐y state.

19:52.950 --> 19:56.658
It's wonderful,
and it permeates all of the
batter of the actual cake.

19:56.658 --> 19:58.695
But if you don't do it
at the right temperature,

19:58.695 --> 20:00.933
and if you don't ribbon
those eggs properly

20:00.933 --> 20:02.637
you can have a cake
that can collapse,

20:02.637 --> 20:05.174
and that would be
a disastrous situation.

20:05.174 --> 20:08.949
The first round,
I lost focus of the stuff
that needed to be done,

20:08.949 --> 20:11.020
and this round,
I have my head on
straight again.

20:11.020 --> 20:14.527
I'm not letting the first round
affect me on how I perform

20:14.527 --> 20:15.863
and I'm gonna
prove that right now.

20:15.863 --> 20:17.867
That's it, Cate, good.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.171
Now, you've got to get
that batch going immediately.

20:20.171 --> 20:22.042
Those eggs take about
two to three minutes

20:22.042 --> 20:24.079
to get to a nice
aerated ribbon state

20:24.079 --> 20:26.250
before you add
the dulce de leche,

20:26.250 --> 20:27.887
and then the flour
at the last moment.

20:27.887 --> 20:29.991
Ramekins get buttered
up the sides,

20:29.991 --> 20:34.166
a very light dusting of flour
so the cake will release itself
once baked,

20:34.166 --> 20:36.070
and then those cakes
need to get in the oven,

20:36.070 --> 20:37.673
and it's baked
for 15 minutes.

20:37.673 --> 20:39.911
Aarón:
Yes, if you don't work
that batter sufficiently,

20:39.911 --> 20:42.082
that dulce de leche
bunches up on you.

20:42.082 --> 20:45.756
When you come to invert it,
it collapses.

20:45.756 --> 20:47.359
Gordon:
But one minute undercooked,

20:47.359 --> 20:48.929
as you come to tip it out
onto the plate,

20:48.929 --> 20:50.933
that wall of sponge
around the outside breaks down

20:50.933 --> 20:53.605
and the whole thing
just oozes out.

20:53.605 --> 20:55.909
18 minutes to go.

20:59.116 --> 21:00.719
Right, Miss Eboni,
how are you feeling?

21:00.719 --> 21:01.888
I'm feeling good, Chef.

21:01.888 --> 21:04.861
Who do you think
is not gonna make it
right now?

21:04.861 --> 21:07.265
‐ Eboni: Cate.
‐ Gordon: She's never been
anywhere near the bottom.

21:07.265 --> 21:10.171
It's actually quite shocking,
but Cate is really cracking
under pressure.

21:10.171 --> 21:11.240
Oh.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.710
‐ 15 minutes to go.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

21:12.710 --> 21:14.413
‐ You've got to get them
in the oven.
‐ I will, Chef.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.450
‐ Young man.
‐ Yes, Chef?

21:16.450 --> 21:20.191
These need a minimum
of 14 minutes in the oven.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.262
‐ We've got to speed up.
‐ Yes, Chef.

21:22.262 --> 21:24.867
‐ Are you feeling the heat?
‐ Yeah, I really am.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.270
I need to be
on that balcony.

21:26.270 --> 21:28.107
It's all I have, Chef.
I gotta do this.

21:28.107 --> 21:29.911
Gordon:
14 and a half minutes
to get yourself

21:29.911 --> 21:33.217
into the finale.
Good luck.

21:33.217 --> 21:36.724
Cate's in the oven.
We should be in the oven now,

21:36.724 --> 21:38.394
otherwise you have
got no chance

21:38.394 --> 21:40.933
of joining Jason
in the finale of "MasterChef."

21:40.933 --> 21:44.172
‐ Aarón: Come on, move!
‐ Gordon: Eboni's in the oven.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.243
We got less than
13 minutes to go,

21:46.243 --> 21:47.412
they need
14 minutes to cook,

21:47.412 --> 21:49.750
and Dino is still
not in the oven.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.120
It needs to go in the oven.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.422
Come on, Dino,
let's go.

21:52.422 --> 21:53.792
‐ Gordon: Get them in the oven!
‐ Gotcha, Chef.

21:56.163 --> 21:57.766
Come on, guys.

21:57.766 --> 21:59.336
All the molten lava cakes
are in the oven.

21:59.336 --> 22:02.475
Who do you think's
next to join Jason
up on the balcony?

22:02.475 --> 22:04.881
Gordon: Eboni.
She is so focused,
it's extraordinary.

22:04.881 --> 22:07.653
And I'm not too sure
if Cate is gonna bounce back.

22:07.653 --> 22:09.256
‐ Christina: Stop.
‐ I'm serious.

22:09.256 --> 22:11.493
Christina:
Gordon, she's never been
in the bottom once

22:11.493 --> 22:13.097
in this competition,
for good reason.

22:15.736 --> 22:17.840
Okay.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.011
Gordon:
Five minutes remaining.

22:20.011 --> 22:22.182
One of you is minutes away

22:22.182 --> 22:24.954
from joining Jason
in the "MasterChef" finale.

22:24.954 --> 22:27.458
Make sure it's you.

22:29.029 --> 22:33.103
Hot spoon, Eboni.
The cream will come off
beautifully.

22:33.103 --> 22:36.878
60 seconds remaining.

22:36.878 --> 22:38.147
Christina:
Dino, you gotta move.

22:38.147 --> 22:39.717
You're driving me crazy
right now.

22:39.717 --> 22:41.119
You've gotta
get one out, Dino.

22:41.119 --> 22:43.057
‐ Jeez.
‐ Gordon: 30 seconds
remaining.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.627
Christina:
Come on, Eboni.
One motion.

22:44.627 --> 22:47.332
Gordon:
Gently, gently, gently.

22:47.332 --> 22:51.206
All:
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

22:51.206 --> 22:53.912
six, five, four,

22:53.912 --> 22:56.884
three, two, one,

22:56.884 --> 22:58.053
‐ Gordon: And stop.
‐ Aarón: Hands in the air.

22:58.053 --> 23:00.559
Gordon:
Hands in the air.

23:05.869 --> 23:06.871
‐ Judges: Ten...
‐ Hold on!

23:06.871 --> 23:09.977
Judges:
...nine, eight, seven,

23:09.977 --> 23:13.017
six, five, four,

23:13.017 --> 23:15.656
three, two, one!

23:15.656 --> 23:19.664
‐ Aarón: Hands in the air.
‐ Gordon: Hands in the air!

23:19.664 --> 23:21.868
Gordon:
Well done.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.738
All of you, very carefully,
bring them round to the front.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.186
Jason:
Stay strong, Dino.

23:31.186 --> 23:32.221
Dino:
Yeah.

23:36.864 --> 23:40.037
Eboni, how long did you
bake your cake?

23:40.037 --> 23:41.941
13 and a half
minutes, Chef.

23:41.941 --> 23:44.580
‐ Think you baked it
long enough?
‐ I do.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.220
Sure it's gonna be
molten lava in the center?

23:48.220 --> 23:49.590
100% positive.

24:00.712 --> 24:03.317
What do you think
about your cake compared
to the others?

24:03.317 --> 24:05.054
I think I got a seat
in the finale.

24:08.026 --> 24:09.362
Is it liquid
in the center?

24:09.362 --> 24:10.699
Molten lava.

24:13.671 --> 24:16.042
Dino,
what happened?

24:16.042 --> 24:17.513
Oh, I failed
you guys.

24:17.513 --> 24:20.017
‐ Did you get it in
too late?
‐ I think so.

24:21.521 --> 24:23.858
All right,
keep your head up,
shake it off.

24:26.096 --> 24:28.367
‐ I mean, it's delicious‐‐
‐ What happened
to his cake, though?

24:28.367 --> 24:30.137
Aarón:
He didn't put enough flour
in there, obviously,

24:30.137 --> 24:31.741
and he waited too late.

24:31.741 --> 24:33.778
Cate.

24:33.778 --> 24:37.051
It definitely looks
like a volcano erupted.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.468
Delicious.

24:46.838 --> 24:48.808
The taste of Cate's
is extraordinary.

24:48.808 --> 24:50.512
‐ Yeah?
‐ And it's slightly broken.

24:50.512 --> 24:52.649
‐ But it still has
more structure.
‐ The flavor's incredible.

24:52.649 --> 24:53.651
Yeah.

24:55.421 --> 24:57.124
All right, home cooks.

24:57.124 --> 25:00.832
Jason is already
through to the finale
of "MasterChef."

25:00.832 --> 25:03.771
Now one of you
has made a molten cake

25:03.771 --> 25:06.978
that has taken you
to the finale.

25:06.978 --> 25:11.554
The home cook
joining Jason is...

25:12.923 --> 25:14.994
Congratulations...

25:14.994 --> 25:15.996
Eboni.

25:15.996 --> 25:17.265
( applause )

25:17.265 --> 25:18.500
Aarón:
Well done.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.807
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Oh, thank you.

25:21.807 --> 25:23.778
Gordon:
Eboni, you know what?

25:23.778 --> 25:26.249
Watching the walls
you built up around yourself,

25:26.249 --> 25:28.988
to see you now months later,

25:28.988 --> 25:31.092
naked and afraid
and determined.

25:31.092 --> 25:34.499
Vulnerable.
Man, you ain't lying.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.704
Gordon:
Get up those stairs

25:36.704 --> 25:39.309
and enjoy spending
quality time

25:39.309 --> 25:41.948
with your fellow finalist.

25:41.948 --> 25:45.020
Eboni:
<i>1999, I was 16 years old</i>
<i>with a brand‐new baby,</i>

25:45.020 --> 25:47.893
sleeping in a car
in Chicago wintertime.

25:47.893 --> 25:49.195
The struggle was real.

25:49.195 --> 25:51.801
It's a long way
from the ghetto.
( laughs )

25:51.801 --> 25:53.805
Now I am in the finale

25:53.805 --> 25:57.211
<i>of the biggest cooking</i>
<i>competition in the world.</i>

25:57.211 --> 25:59.883
What do you think of me now?

25:59.883 --> 26:03.190
‐ I can't ( bleep ) breathe.
‐ Keep breathing,
keep breathing.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.359
So...

26:06.329 --> 26:07.966
We have
two finalists.

26:07.966 --> 26:11.306
There are three spots
in this year's finale.

26:11.306 --> 26:13.778
One of you...

26:13.778 --> 26:17.051
will be taking a place
with Jason and Eboni

26:17.051 --> 26:19.623
in the "MasterChef" finale.

26:19.623 --> 26:25.535
And after the next battle,
one of you will be going home
empty‐handed.

26:25.535 --> 26:29.977
It all comes down
to the next and final
challenge.

26:31.514 --> 26:33.985
Please, follow us.

26:33.985 --> 26:35.020
Dino:
<i>I'm very embarrassed.</i>

26:35.020 --> 26:36.590
<i>I'm very ashamed</i>
<i>of what I did.</i>

26:36.590 --> 26:39.663
This is the lowest
I've ever felt since
being here,

26:39.663 --> 26:43.203
<i>but I can't go into the next</i>
<i>battle all falling apart.</i>

26:43.203 --> 26:45.675
This is the last opportunity
to become that MasterChef.

26:45.675 --> 26:47.913
<i>I need to regroup.</i>

26:47.913 --> 26:50.017
This is it.

26:50.017 --> 26:53.725
Your entire fate
of this entire competition

26:53.725 --> 26:55.562
hangs in the balance.

26:58.568 --> 26:59.903
For your final
battle tonight,

26:59.903 --> 27:02.007
you'll be making
a MasterChef classic.

27:02.007 --> 27:05.180
A savory version
of one of the world's

27:05.180 --> 27:07.986
toughest desserts
to master.

27:07.986 --> 27:09.857
An incredible...

27:09.857 --> 27:11.059
a temperamental...

27:14.933 --> 27:16.169
( gasps )

27:21.781 --> 27:23.718
Gordon:
For your final
battle tonight,

27:23.718 --> 27:26.122
you'll be making
a MasterChef classic.

27:26.122 --> 27:28.260
A savory version

27:28.260 --> 27:32.536
of one of the world's
toughest desserts to master.

27:32.536 --> 27:33.805
An incredible...

27:33.805 --> 27:35.942
a temperamental...

27:38.714 --> 27:41.386
‐ ...cheese soufflé.
‐ ( gasps )

27:41.386 --> 27:43.958
Got that
crispness on top.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.962
An amazing distribution
of the egg whites

27:45.962 --> 27:48.400
across that wonderful
cheese sauce.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.903
Semi‐liquid at the bottom,

27:49.903 --> 27:53.310
thick, rich,
oozing all that savory cheese,

27:53.310 --> 27:55.815
baked to perfection.

27:55.815 --> 27:59.957
Tonight, you'll have
just 30 minutes to perfect
your soufflés.

27:59.957 --> 28:05.100
And seeing as this is
the semi‐final,

28:05.100 --> 28:08.975
one soufflé
is not required.

28:11.246 --> 28:13.083
You'll be making three.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.093
Please,
head to your stations.

28:18.093 --> 28:20.430
Eboni:
<i>Three cheese soufflés</i>
<i>in 30 minutes.</i>

28:20.430 --> 28:23.971
Do you know how hard it is
to do a savory soufflé?

28:23.971 --> 28:26.944
Then three of them,
in 30 minutes.

28:26.944 --> 28:29.516
Ha! I'm glad
I'm on this balcony.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.290
On your stations,
you'll find everything
that you need

28:33.290 --> 28:37.164
to make us three amazing,
stunning cheese soufflés.

28:37.164 --> 28:40.605
Dino, Cate,
give it all you've got.

28:40.605 --> 28:43.811
Your 30 minutes starts...

28:43.811 --> 28:44.947
...now.

28:49.823 --> 28:51.794
Right now,
it's me versus Dino,

28:51.794 --> 28:53.664
<i>and I know Dino</i>
<i>is super fast,</i>

28:53.664 --> 28:56.035
but he's so unpredictable,

28:56.035 --> 28:59.475
<i>so I'm hoping</i>
<i>my attention to the details</i>

28:59.475 --> 29:03.249
is what's gonna bring me
the win this time.

29:03.249 --> 29:05.688
Cate has made
a soufflé before.

29:05.688 --> 29:08.928
so she has
that slight advantage on me.

29:08.928 --> 29:10.832
<i>But I'm very good</i>
<i>at multitasking,</i>

29:10.832 --> 29:14.438
so I'm gonna be using every
single second of that clock.

29:16.376 --> 29:18.781
This is the absolute
last chance

29:18.781 --> 29:21.620
for one of these two home cooks
to make it into the finale.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.824
Aarón: Asking them to present
three cheese soufflés,

29:23.824 --> 29:25.060
all with the perfect rise,

29:25.060 --> 29:27.297
all with a great flavor
and texture.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.237
Come on, guys.

29:32.174 --> 29:33.343
Gordon:
The first and foremost
important thing

29:33.343 --> 29:34.546
is your cheese sauce.

29:34.546 --> 29:36.215
Add your butter,
your milk.

29:36.215 --> 29:38.420
Cook out that flour
so you haven't got
that raw texture.

29:38.420 --> 29:41.059
That's your base.
After that,
separate your eggs,

29:41.059 --> 29:43.531
and then you start
whipping those egg whites.

29:46.202 --> 29:48.507
If those egg whites
aren't whipped up
sufficiently,

29:48.507 --> 29:50.778
then your actual mix
becomes too dense,

29:50.778 --> 29:53.083
so there's no height
on the soufflé.

29:53.083 --> 29:57.792
Much like a sweet soufflé,
a savory soufflé's ramekin
needs to be buttered,

29:57.792 --> 30:02.134
and instead
of sugar you coat them
with a dry parmesan cheese.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.808
Again, to give
that savory soufflé
something to hold onto.

30:05.808 --> 30:07.277
Gordon:
Sure.

30:07.277 --> 30:09.115
Dino's working
much faster than Cate.

30:09.115 --> 30:11.653
Cate's not even whisking
her egg whites.

30:11.653 --> 30:12.989
In four minutes from now,

30:12.989 --> 30:15.795
you've got to get
your soufflés
in the oven.

30:17.632 --> 30:19.836
20 minutes remaining.

30:19.836 --> 30:21.405
Now, if you have
your heat on

30:21.405 --> 30:22.942
while you're adding
your cheese into your sauce,

30:22.942 --> 30:24.478
what happens is the fat
runs out the cheese.

30:24.478 --> 30:27.017
It starts to look grainy.
It starts to look broken.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.703
18 and a half
minutes to go.

30:36.703 --> 30:40.711
They need at least
15 to 16 minutes
in the oven...

30:41.713 --> 30:43.383
...to perfect your soufflé.

30:55.340 --> 30:56.843
You've got to start
filling your molds, guys,

30:56.843 --> 30:59.683
otherwise they're not gonna
have sufficient time to cook.

30:59.683 --> 31:03.189
Why is it Cate made the mix
but hasn't even buttered
her molds?

31:03.189 --> 31:04.826
You've gotta do that
while you're mixing
your egg whites.

31:04.826 --> 31:06.128
You have to multitask.

31:06.128 --> 31:07.966
The longer that mix
stays out in the warm kitchen,

31:07.966 --> 31:09.301
it deflates.

31:12.107 --> 31:14.879
15 and a half
minutes to go.

31:14.879 --> 31:16.850
Christina:
Get them in the oven.

31:20.023 --> 31:21.827
Aarón: All right,
Dino has just put
three in the oven.

31:21.827 --> 31:23.396
Come on, Cate,
let's go.

31:28.139 --> 31:29.976
Dino's put two more in.

31:32.882 --> 31:35.821
Cate doesn't have
a single soufflé in.

31:35.821 --> 31:37.357
Listen, she may
put less in,

31:37.357 --> 31:39.194
they still could
cook beautifully.

31:39.194 --> 31:40.998
It's all about
the taste, guys.

31:44.271 --> 31:46.175
Christina: Cate's got
her soufflés in the oven,

31:46.175 --> 31:48.847
but she's only made three.

31:48.847 --> 31:50.785
‐ Gordon: I mean,
it's all or nothing.
‐ Aarón: Yep.

31:52.922 --> 31:54.358
Gordon:
Ten minutes to go.

31:54.358 --> 31:55.393
Come on.

31:56.395 --> 31:57.732
‐ Hey.
‐ Yes, Chef.

31:57.732 --> 31:59.368
‐ How many's in there?
‐ There's five in there, Chef.

31:59.368 --> 32:01.540
But why are they all
to the left‐hand side
of the oven?

32:01.540 --> 32:02.742
I thought I was gonna put
another rack here,

32:02.742 --> 32:04.178
but I realized I only
had one, so...

32:04.178 --> 32:07.050
‐ Why five?
‐ Five 'cause I need
that insurance policy.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.152
I'm desperate.
I need this.

32:08.152 --> 32:09.188
I got nothing waiting
for me at home.

32:09.188 --> 32:10.658
This is it.
This is why I'm here.

32:10.658 --> 32:11.760
So I need to make sure
that I give you

32:11.760 --> 32:13.162
the three prettiest
ones that I have.

32:13.162 --> 32:16.903
You've still got
eight minutes remaining.

32:16.903 --> 32:18.741
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Adjust accordingly, okay?

32:18.741 --> 32:19.776
Yes, Chef.

32:21.245 --> 32:22.515
Oh, damn.

32:22.515 --> 32:24.284
‐ Gordon: How you feeling?
‐ Cate: I feel great.

32:24.284 --> 32:26.623
I have all my eggs
in this basket.

32:26.623 --> 32:28.092
I have no insurance policy
this time.

32:28.092 --> 32:29.194
I didn't have time
for one.

32:29.194 --> 32:31.800
It would have just
messed up the oven heat

32:31.800 --> 32:33.469
if I had to
open it again.

32:33.469 --> 32:34.806
I thought you
were a multitasker

32:34.806 --> 32:36.142
going into
this last challenge.

32:36.142 --> 32:38.814
You were doing one thing
at a time, so sort of‐‐

32:38.814 --> 32:42.789
I was‐‐ I was scared to,
like, burn something,
or let something go.

32:42.789 --> 32:45.260
It's only one chance
so I wanted to just
make sure.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.563
Gordon:
Adjust your timing.

32:46.563 --> 32:48.099
You've got them literally
sat in the middle of the oven...

32:48.099 --> 32:49.903
‐ It's perfect, yeah.
‐ ...which is the best place.

32:49.903 --> 32:51.807
‐ It's all yours to win.
‐ Yeah.

32:51.807 --> 32:53.309
Just over five minutes.
Good luck.

32:53.309 --> 32:54.411
Thank you, Chef.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.453
Aarón:
What are you seeing
out there?

32:58.453 --> 32:59.856
Gordon: Right now,
this is anybody's game.

32:59.856 --> 33:02.394
Cate has three perfectly
centered in her oven.

33:02.394 --> 33:04.264
I was more nervous
for Cate,

33:04.264 --> 33:05.801
but honestly,
I've seen those soufflés.

33:05.801 --> 33:08.774
Now I'm more nervous
for Dino than I am Cate.

33:08.774 --> 33:11.913
Dino's stuck five soufflés
on one tray,

33:11.913 --> 33:13.617
slightly touching
each other,

33:13.617 --> 33:16.756
and he's put them all
to the left‐hand side
of the oven.

33:16.756 --> 33:20.598
‐ What?
‐ You've got to cook
soufflés in the center.

33:20.598 --> 33:23.504
‐ Baby doll.
‐ Not yet.
( chuckles )

33:23.504 --> 33:26.308
When I see them risen
and perfect color,
you get the "baby doll."

33:26.308 --> 33:30.651
If you need to crank up
the oven 10 or 15 degrees,
do it.

33:30.651 --> 33:32.955
‐ How you looking, baby?
‐ I'm looking good.

33:32.955 --> 33:35.093
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>it's do or die.</i>

33:35.093 --> 33:38.132
It's either
three perfect soufflés,

33:38.132 --> 33:40.771
or me taking off
my apron

33:40.771 --> 33:43.342
<i>and going back</i>
<i>to Chicago.</i>

33:43.342 --> 33:45.681
‐ It's gonna be one of us,
you know that.
‐ Yeah.

33:45.681 --> 33:47.484
60 seconds to go.

33:49.187 --> 33:50.456
Dino:
<i>This is it.</i>

33:50.456 --> 33:52.795
I cannot add time.
I cannot change the recipe.

33:52.795 --> 33:56.636
Everything that I just did
could be the last time
I can cook here.

33:56.636 --> 34:00.511
My fate could
either rise or fall

34:00.511 --> 34:02.447
with these soufflés.

34:07.457 --> 34:08.994
60 seconds to go.

34:08.994 --> 34:11.031
Three soufflés,
one spot left

34:11.031 --> 34:12.969
in the "MasterChef" finale.

34:12.969 --> 34:15.306
Baby doll, come on.
You're coloring,
you're coloring.

34:15.306 --> 34:17.812
You're looking good,
baby, come on.

34:17.812 --> 34:20.718
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine, eight,

34:20.718 --> 34:23.155
seven, six, five,

34:23.155 --> 34:25.393
four, three,

34:25.393 --> 34:26.830
two, one!

34:26.830 --> 34:27.832
‐ Gordon: Stop!
‐ Aarón: That's it!

34:27.832 --> 34:29.134
Christina: Hands in the air!

34:29.134 --> 34:31.205
Gordon:
Hands in the air.

34:31.205 --> 34:34.411
Carefully bring
your plates down
to the front, let's go.

34:34.411 --> 34:37.050
I am shocked
that Cate has come out

34:37.050 --> 34:39.488
with three
passable soufflés.

34:39.488 --> 34:42.895
With no insurance policy,
that was a big gamble.

34:42.895 --> 34:44.364
Look good, Dino.

34:44.364 --> 34:46.736
Jason:
<i>Dino's, there's</i>
<i>a little bit higher lift,</i>

34:46.736 --> 34:49.007
<i>but the coloring</i>
<i>isn't as even.</i>

34:49.007 --> 34:50.944
<i>Are the soufflés</i>
<i>the proper texture,</i>

34:50.944 --> 34:53.884
<i>or is it a soupy mess,</i>
<i>or is it overdone?</i>

34:53.884 --> 34:55.954
It's all
in the judges' hands now.

35:01.566 --> 35:02.635
Dino:
<i>I'm sweating like hell</i>
<i>right now.</i>

35:02.635 --> 35:03.737
I'm sweating because
they're not

35:03.737 --> 35:05.974
the most perfect soufflés
I could've made,

35:05.974 --> 35:08.312
<i>but I know</i>
<i>that I cooked them right.</i>

35:10.316 --> 35:12.387
<i>It's all down to the inside,</i>
<i>to the texture,</i>

35:12.387 --> 35:14.257
<i>and the taste.</i>

35:29.387 --> 35:31.125
My soufflés look great.

35:31.125 --> 35:34.197
<i>They've risen beautifully.</i>
<i>They're all golden brown.</i>

35:34.197 --> 35:37.403
<i>They're exactly why</i>
<i>I took that extra minute</i>

35:37.403 --> 35:40.209
<i>to make them perfect</i>
<i>before I put them</i>
<i>in the oven.</i>

35:40.209 --> 35:42.982
I'm just praying
that they're cooked inside.

35:56.074 --> 35:58.245
Both of you.

35:58.245 --> 36:00.483
Extraordinary performance.

36:00.483 --> 36:02.922
There's a lot
on the line.

36:02.922 --> 36:05.928
There's a lot of details
for us to discuss.

36:05.928 --> 36:08.098
Please give us a moment.

36:13.777 --> 36:16.883
This is so difficult.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.454
Dino's, the soufflés were
sort of pushed over
like a wave.

36:19.454 --> 36:21.759
Christina:
They were so close to the fan
in that convection oven.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.395
That's why they have
to be in the center.

36:23.395 --> 36:24.732
They're broken
a little bit for me.

36:24.732 --> 36:26.636
I could taste a little bit
of grease from the cheese,

36:26.636 --> 36:28.573
but the taste
was extraordinary.

36:28.573 --> 36:30.978
It was so balanced.
It was well‐seasoned.

36:30.978 --> 36:32.781
It had the right amount
of cheese.

36:32.781 --> 36:35.253
‐ Good luck.
‐ Good luck to you.

36:35.253 --> 36:38.292
Christina:
Cate's soufflés were
a little bit more sturdy

36:38.292 --> 36:39.862
but also then underbaked
in the center,

36:39.862 --> 36:41.833
because she got
her soufflés in the oven

36:41.833 --> 36:43.536
a minute after Dino.

36:43.536 --> 36:45.507
Even though she had a less
amount of time to cook,

36:45.507 --> 36:47.645
it still felt
more rounded out.

36:47.645 --> 36:50.349
I felt that the egg whites
could've been a little
more aerated,

36:50.349 --> 36:52.487
so the mixture would've
been less liquid.

36:52.487 --> 36:54.825
Aarón: I mean,
we're talking
about minute details.

36:54.825 --> 36:56.028
Gordon:
Big time.

37:01.506 --> 37:03.242
Dino, Cate.

37:03.242 --> 37:05.079
It's been a really
tough decision.

37:05.079 --> 37:06.983
It came down to the finer
details tonight,

37:06.983 --> 37:08.954
in terms of flavor
and who really nailed

37:08.954 --> 37:12.460
that incredible texture
of the soufflé.

37:12.460 --> 37:16.536
The person
picking up that last spot
in the "MasterChef" finale...

37:19.542 --> 37:22.280
that third spot...

37:23.382 --> 37:24.384
goes to...

37:28.192 --> 37:29.729
congratulations...

37:39.014 --> 37:40.584
Dino.

37:41.986 --> 37:44.357
Congratulations.

37:44.357 --> 37:45.694
Gordon:
Absolutely amazing.

37:45.694 --> 37:46.763
It was so close.

37:46.763 --> 37:49.234
Dino, please say
goodbye to Cate,

37:49.234 --> 37:51.438
and head on up
to the balcony.

37:51.438 --> 37:55.346
Bye!
I'm so happy for you.
Good job!

37:57.116 --> 37:58.787
You're gonna rock it.

38:00.356 --> 38:03.462
Everything I've ever worked for,
it's paid off.

38:03.462 --> 38:05.901
Everything I've ever
been through has paid off.

38:05.901 --> 38:07.336
<i>To be a part of the finale,</i>

38:07.336 --> 38:09.842
that is not only
my dream come true,

38:09.842 --> 38:11.478
but my mother's dream.

38:11.478 --> 38:16.556
<i>She had me at 19.</i>
<i>She gave up her entire life</i>
<i>for me.</i>

38:16.556 --> 38:19.427
And now her baby boy

38:19.427 --> 38:23.402
made it to the finale.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.572
( mouths words )

38:27.043 --> 38:29.013
Oh, Cate.

38:29.013 --> 38:32.019
You've been
an extraordinary competitor.

38:32.019 --> 38:34.558
How are you feeling?
Come on.

38:34.558 --> 38:37.263
Um, I appreciate
you all so much

38:37.263 --> 38:40.436
for believing in me
and pushing me.

38:40.436 --> 38:42.774
I started my journey
so long ago,

38:42.774 --> 38:44.578
as you all know.

38:44.578 --> 38:48.385
From last season to now,
I've excelled,
I've learned,

38:48.385 --> 38:50.422
I've grown as a chef.

38:50.422 --> 38:54.464
And even though my journey
here in this kitchen is over,

38:54.464 --> 38:56.134
I'm still gonna open
a health cafe.

38:56.134 --> 38:58.438
I'm still gonna do
everything I want in life.

38:58.438 --> 39:02.113
Gordon: This journey's
confirmed that you have
a spot in our world.

39:02.113 --> 39:04.518
‐ Absolutely.
‐ It's what you do with it
next that counts,

39:04.518 --> 39:07.290
and this has been
your foundation.

39:07.290 --> 39:08.593
Come up and say
goodbye, young lady.

39:08.593 --> 39:10.429
‐ Ahh!
‐ Man.

39:10.429 --> 39:11.899
Too soon!

39:11.899 --> 39:13.870
Thank you so much
for everything.

39:13.870 --> 39:15.807
Great job, Cate,
you were amazing.

39:15.807 --> 39:18.613
‐ Thank you, thank you.
‐ You're gonna be great.

39:18.613 --> 39:20.449
‐ You're gonna be so great.
‐ Thank you.

39:20.449 --> 39:24.424
( sighs )
One, two, three,
talented individuals.

39:24.424 --> 39:27.564
Who is gonna become
America's next MasterChef?

39:27.564 --> 39:29.768
( sighs )
It's so tough.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.941
I'm gonna go
with Eboni.

39:32.941 --> 39:38.620
I think her tenacity
is going to prevail
in this competition.

39:38.620 --> 39:41.324
Have a safe trip back home.
Please, place your apron
on your bench.

39:41.324 --> 39:42.928
‐ Thank you!
‐ Thank you, Cate.

39:42.928 --> 39:46.535
Jason:
Cate, we love you.
We're so proud of you.

39:46.535 --> 39:49.173
When I first came back here,
I had one goal,

39:49.173 --> 39:51.812
<i>and it was</i>
<i>to get my apron.</i>

39:51.812 --> 39:54.450
<i>I made it</i>
<i>to the very last step</i>

39:54.450 --> 39:56.889
before the finale.
That's huge.

39:56.889 --> 39:58.793
Whoo‐hoo!

39:58.793 --> 40:01.298
<i>I had some obstacles</i>
<i>throughout this competition</i>

40:01.298 --> 40:03.335
<i>and it feels like I've climbed</i>
<i>over Mt. Everest</i>

40:03.335 --> 40:04.538
to get to this point.

40:04.538 --> 40:07.410
If you can't cook
two omelets side by side,

40:07.410 --> 40:09.915
untie your apron
and give it to me now.

40:09.915 --> 40:12.888
Cate:
<i>Not only did I learn</i>
<i>about cooking...</i>

40:12.888 --> 40:13.923
This is unbelievable.

40:13.923 --> 40:17.330
I know you can cook,
but this is fabulous.

40:17.330 --> 40:18.332
Cate:
Thanks, Dad.

40:19.601 --> 40:21.237
<i>...I've learned</i>
<i>more about myself...</i>

40:21.237 --> 40:22.507
Mmm!

40:22.507 --> 40:25.079
<i>...and my strengths</i>
<i>and my weaknesses.</i>

40:25.079 --> 40:27.617
Gorgeous!
Gorgeous!

40:27.617 --> 40:29.187
I've won so many challenges.

40:29.187 --> 40:31.759
Congratulations, Cate.

40:31.759 --> 40:33.629
‐ Whoo!
‐ The winner is Cate.

40:33.629 --> 40:37.637
‐ Christina: Well done.
‐ I came here for redemption...

40:37.637 --> 40:40.309
‐ ( all cheering )
‐ Gordon: Congratulations,
Red Team!

40:40.309 --> 40:43.115
And I redeemed myself
and some.

40:43.115 --> 40:44.985
I'm one of the few people
that doesn't like cheesecake,

40:44.985 --> 40:47.156
and you completely
changed me.

40:47.156 --> 40:49.327
That is really,
really special.

40:49.327 --> 40:51.297
For the first time
in this competition,

40:51.297 --> 40:54.938
‐ I feel like I'm tasting
food in the finale.
‐ Shut up.

40:54.938 --> 40:57.176
<i>My dream was, yeah,</i>
<i>to win the trophy,</i>

40:57.176 --> 41:02.119
but I still feel
like I won an experience
of a lifetime.

41:06.595 --> 41:07.798
Announcer:
<i>Next week,</i>

41:07.798 --> 41:10.035
<i>it's the two‐hour</i>
<i>"MasterChef" finale.</i>

41:10.035 --> 41:12.574
Please welcome back
the one and only,

41:12.574 --> 41:14.812
‐ Joe Bastianich!
‐ Oh, my God!

41:14.812 --> 41:17.617
I am about to pee my pants.
Are you kidding me?

41:17.617 --> 41:19.788
<i>The world's biggest</i>
<i>cooking competition...</i>

41:19.788 --> 41:21.157
This is it.

41:21.157 --> 41:24.297
<i>...comes to an end,</i>
<i>as Jason, Eboni, and Dino...</i>

41:24.297 --> 41:27.136
‐ Ow!
‐ <i>...face off for a quarter</i>
<i>of a million dollars...</i>

41:27.136 --> 41:28.806
Boom, there you go.

41:28.806 --> 41:30.844
<i>...and the MasterChef title.</i>

41:30.844 --> 41:33.850
America's
next MasterChef is...

41:33.850 --> 41:36.989
( cheers, applause )
