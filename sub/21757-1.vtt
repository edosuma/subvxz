a lot of fun.

00:11.033 --> 00:13.033

00:13.033 --> 00:15.166
- A lot of sneaking onto the
boat in last night's clothes.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.166

00:18.166 --> 00:19.767

put in the washers?

08:44.700 --> 08:46.367
We're gonna run
without a boatswain.

08:46.367 --> 08:50.100
- Okay.
- So it's your crew.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.400
Nico did a good job last season,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.033
so I'm gonna have to rely
heavily on Nico

08:54.033 --> 08:56.433
to be in charge out there,

08:56.433 --> 08:58.567
but I'm not ready
to make him a boatswain

08:58.567 --> 09:01.133
by any stretch
of the imagination yet.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.700
You've got some green ones,

09:02.700 --> 09:04.567
one or two that
have some experience.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.734
- Okay.
- And Kate's back.

09:06.734 --> 09:09.333
- Great.
- And you know the boat already.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.066
- Yeah, exactly. Knock knock.
- Hi.

09:12.066 --> 09:14.467
- Hi, Kate. How's it going?
- Good.

09:14.467 --> 09:16.133
- Me and Kate had our
differences last season.

09:16.133 --> 09:17.734
Well, let's just stop, Kate.

09:17.734 --> 09:19.066
- I'm not done. I'm not done.
I'm not done.

09:19.066 --> 09:20.700
- Kate can go f--- herself.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.600
But it's all about maturing
and just moving on,

09:23.600 --> 09:25.734
and if you can't then
you're in the wrong industry.

09:25.734 --> 09:27.400
- Matt, this is Nico.
- Hey, how's it going, man?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.066
- Hi, nice to meet you.

09:29.066 --> 09:30.333
- Actually, you two
are gonna be roommates.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.700
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.467
- I think Bruno's in there.
- He was.

09:33.467 --> 09:34.700
- Oh, okay.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.100
- Knock knock.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.633
- Hi. Are you Chris?
- I'm Chris Brown, yeah.

09:41.633 --> 09:44.166
- Chris Brown?
- Like the famous guy.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.100
- Do you spend a lot of time
in the bathroom?

09:47.100 --> 09:49.100
- Yeah.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.367
- For me, rooming with a guy,
I have more bathroom time.

09:50.367 --> 09:52.100
- I like that strategy.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.166
- Maybe we should
just say something.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.500
- Hi there.
- Hi.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.734
- How's it going?
- Good.

09:56.734 --> 09:58.500
- Nico.
- Jen. Nice to meet you.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.633
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Nico.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.033
- Long time no see.
- Oh, my God.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.166
We met in Barcelona.
- Nice.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.500
- Long time ago.
- Yeah.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.767
- Cool.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.767
- We were docked
at the same dock,

10:08.767 --> 10:10.767
and some of his crew and my crew
decided to go out one night.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.600
We ended up in a taxi together.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.567
He was very flirtatious,
very drunk.

10:15.567 --> 10:17.500
- Well, this should be fun.
- I'm excited, yeah.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.200
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.500
- Chris Brown.
- Brianna.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.734
- Nico.
- What's up?

10:21.734 --> 10:23.266
I'm Chris Brown.
Nice to meet you.

10:23.266 --> 10:26.133
- Chris Brown.
- What's up, man?

10:26.133 --> 10:28.000
- Bruno.
- Chris Brown. Nice to meet you.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.133
- Nice to meet you. Go ahead.
- Chris Brown's in here?

10:30.133 --> 10:32.533
- Yes.

10:32.533 --> 10:34.133
- I guess we're only waiting
for one more crew member.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.633
- Yeah.
- Oh.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.066
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:37.066 --> 10:38.533
- How's it going?
- Hi there.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.533
- I'm Baker.
- You're my roommate.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.200
You're gonna be on the top bunk,
and I'm gonna grab your uniform.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.233
- Sweet.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.133
- If you want to start forward.

10:46.133 --> 10:47.633
- Windows as well, right?
Everything.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.000
- Yeah, everything.

10:50.734 --> 10:54.066
- Grody.
- Oh, we have cockroaches.

10:54.066 --> 10:56.633
Kate, I just found a cockroach.
Oh, there it is there.

10:56.633 --> 10:57.667
- Oh, it's still alive?
You didn't kill it?

10:57.667 --> 10:59.133
- A little baby. I can't.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.266
- What, are you a Buddhist?
Kill it.

11:00.266 --> 11:02.066
- I got him. There you go.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.667
- Great. "Oh, let's not
kill the cockroach.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.233
Let's just keep it
onboard to breed."

11:05.233 --> 11:08.166
Like, what? He's so Canadian.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.000
- "Just kill it."
- Girls, do you mind

11:11.000 --> 11:13.567
if we do a stewardess
meeting in the sky lounge?

11:13.567 --> 11:14.700
- Yeah.
- Let's just tell each other

11:14.700 --> 11:16.233
our experience.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.567
- Brianna, how's
your service skills?

11:18.567 --> 11:21.033
- I don't have a lot
of service experience.

11:21.033 --> 11:24.433
- How's your service?
- I was a cocktail waitress.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.567
- I have 2 years of experience,

11:26.567 --> 11:28.700
although it's been,
like, 2 years.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.567
- Okay. Chris Brown?

11:31.567 --> 11:33.033
- I'm green as sh--.

11:33.033 --> 11:36.233
- Okay.
- This is my first yacht.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.700
- Um...

11:37.700 --> 11:39.166
- You studied culinary
arts as well?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.767
- That was in high school.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.433
- Bartending?
- Oh, my gosh.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.166
This needs to be
updated for sure.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.533
So I did take
a bartending course years ago,

11:46.533 --> 11:49.200
but I never followed through
after with, like, work.

11:50.734 --> 11:54.066
- Every season I am hoping
this will be the season

11:54.066 --> 11:57.533
I don't have to train
green stewardesses,

11:57.533 --> 12:01.133
but clearly it just
seems to get worse.

12:01.133 --> 12:04.467
What about coffees? Do you
guys know how to do lattes?

12:04.467 --> 12:07.533
- I know how to work a Keurig.
- All right.

12:08.467 --> 12:10.133
- Coming up...
- You guys doing good?

12:10.133 --> 12:12.700
- Just a bunch of cushions
[inaudible].

12:12.700 --> 12:19.233
- Jesus Christ. We got cushions
over the side. F---ing idiots.

12:19.333 --> 12:19.767
- We used this boat last season,

12:19.767 --> 12:20.300
- We used this boat last season,
so I know how it works.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.734
- This is where
all of our polish is.

12:23.734 --> 12:25.700
[inaudible] mops, deck brushes.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.767
- Right in here
is all the placemats.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.367
- There's our boatswain's
locker right there.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.233
- All these beds.
Pretty easy to clean.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.700
There's the bathroom in here.
The pillows. Water spots.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.200
- The boat is like a maze.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.734
There's staircases
and hidden doors.

12:38.734 --> 12:40.333
- This is our cleaning closet.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.333
- Fun things around
every corner.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.100
- Start making the cabins
look great,

12:45.100 --> 12:46.233
and then I'll meet you guys
and we'll do the

12:46.233 --> 12:47.233
[inaudible]
together.

12:47.233 --> 12:52.100
- Okay.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.100
- How's it going?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.033
- Great.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.767
- I can tell by the tone of
your voice how excited you are.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.367
- Well, it's just, like, we've
got a ton of work coming up,

12:58.367 --> 13:01.633
and I don't mind it,
but I'm not excited.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.333
- The feeling is mutual.

13:03.333 --> 13:06.567
- I'm pretty sure I told Bruno
starboard forward

13:06.567 --> 13:07.700
and then he came in here.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.633
[inaudible]

13:09.633 --> 13:13.667
- Maybe he didn't know where
starboard or forward was.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.233
- It's not easy being green.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.133
- Do you know any knots?
- A couple, man.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.667
I pulled up some YouTube videos

13:18.667 --> 13:20.266
and tied my headphones
into a knot

13:20.266 --> 13:21.734
and felt like I did
a good enough job

13:21.734 --> 13:23.600
to go back to drinking.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.266
For the majority of growing up

13:25.266 --> 13:27.600
being a Christian
identified who I am,

13:27.600 --> 13:30.133
and I was celibate
for 26 years of my life,

13:30.133 --> 13:32.333
so I've got to make up
for lost time.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.200
- So are you a drinker?
- I do enjoy drinking, man.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.233
Four things Chris Brown
loves the most?

13:37.233 --> 13:40.133
Women, alcohol,
snowboarding, and travel.

13:40.133 --> 13:43.266
Yachting covers three,
so let's give this a go.

13:43.266 --> 13:46.066
- What are you into?
Are you, like, a girly girl?

13:46.066 --> 13:47.233
A tomboy?

13:47.233 --> 13:49.000
- A little bit of both.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.166
I come from a more traditional
Southern family,

13:51.166 --> 13:55.433
just a long line of prominent
gentlemen and classy ladies,

13:55.433 --> 13:57.700
but I'm a little different.

13:57.700 --> 14:01.166
I live in an RV seasonally.
I like to go to Burning Man.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.367
I'm a little more debu-not
than debutante.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.700
Southern belle.
I grew up all girly girly,

14:06.700 --> 14:09.667
but I evolved a little bit
since then.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.000
- So tell me more
about yourself.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.033
Are you dating someone?
- Single.

14:15.033 --> 14:18.166
I've been traveling a lot for
the past two and a half years.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.133
- Cool.
- And you?

14:20.133 --> 14:22.367
- My last relationship
was brief.

14:22.367 --> 14:25.433
- Oh, my God.
- Surprise!

14:28.567 --> 14:30.300
- I realized it was not
that cool.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.300
I don't trust my judgment.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.066
If I'm attracted to someone,
it's probably bad news.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.066
- Do you want me
to do the others?

14:36.066 --> 14:37.433
- Yeah, if you don't mind.

14:37.433 --> 14:39.033
- Yeah.
- Attention all crew.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.166
Staff meeting in
the main slot in 5.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.767
- Copy.
- Copy.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.467
- I want to introduce Garreth,
first officer,

14:48.467 --> 14:50.700
and our chief engineer Darrien.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.033
We don't run
with a lot of rules.

14:53.033 --> 14:55.133
One is you will work hard.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.734
We have some green crew,

14:56.734 --> 14:58.700
and we can teach you
anything you need to know,

14:58.700 --> 15:01.667
but once you're shown something
and you screw it up,

15:01.667 --> 15:03.266
it's not a good thing.

15:05.266 --> 15:07.300
Like, even the jewelry
he wears, the gold,

15:07.300 --> 15:09.300
and he's, like, kind of tough.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.600
- Don't embarrass yourself,
and don't embarrass the boat.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.600
We're not gonna
drink on charter.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.333
Tips get divided up equally.

15:15.333 --> 15:18.066
If you don't deserve
the same amount,

15:18.066 --> 15:21.767
then there's also a plane ticket
in your tip envelope.

15:21.767 --> 15:24.233
Guests arrive tomorrow, and
we'll be off the dock at noon.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.767
Let's get to work. We've got
provisions coming down to dock.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.467
Let's get it onboard ASAP.

15:29.467 --> 15:30.500
- Copy.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.100
- Been drinking a lot lately.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.367
- You drink much?
- Yeah.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.200
- Not like crazy
like normal chefs?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.033
- No, I'm actually trying to--
- Cut it back?

15:40.033 --> 15:41.066
- Yeah, hopefully.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.500
- There's a lot.

15:45.500 --> 15:49.100
- I'm already lost. I'm not
really sure where this goes.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.333
As a single mom
I haven't got a break,

15:51.333 --> 15:53.367
but my dad retired recently,

15:53.367 --> 15:56.266
and because of that I have
flexibility in being able

15:56.266 --> 15:59.233
to live my dream.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.233
That looks good.

16:00.233 --> 16:02.000
- Yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.133
- What do you think
about the team though?

16:03.133 --> 16:04.400
- The girls seem pretty foxy.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.233
Are you single, bro?
- Yeah.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.734
I'm really focused
on my job right now.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.734
Awesome.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.400
- How do you like
to do breakfast?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.333
- We'll definitely do
a breakfast special,

16:28.333 --> 16:31.133
a lunch special. Dinner menu
planned the night before.

16:31.133 --> 16:32.233
- Most of the yacht chefs
I've worked with are crazy.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.133
- Do you want to cook?

16:34.133 --> 16:35.133
Would you like to cook?
Are you any good at cooking?

16:35.133 --> 16:37.166
- I told you--

16:37.166 --> 16:39.033
- Then don't come out
with that bullsh-- to me, yeah?

16:39.033 --> 16:41.033
- It's always been breakfast,
but I won't use the word

16:41.033 --> 16:42.233
"breakfast"; I'll just say it's
the first meal of the day.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.166
- It is breakfast.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.300
- That's just for us to make it
a lot easier for them.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.100
- I love it.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.133
Matt is enthusiastic
and organized and nice,

16:49.133 --> 16:51.000
and I can't help but wonder
if this is too good to be true.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.433
Yay, I love it.

My best bet is not to be
as strict as I normally would be

17:16.166 --> 17:17.700
- No.
- Fold it up.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.066
See that little
triangle facing up?

17:19.066 --> 17:20.433
- Yep.
- And then--

17:20.433 --> 17:22.200
- I feel like I've done
this before.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.266
- So if you have a couple
minutes to practice that

17:24.266 --> 17:27.000
one, it's fine. Hopefully
they're gonna catch on.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.066
- Matt, Kate, Nico, I need
your guys in the crew mess.

17:30.066 --> 17:34.200
- Copy.
- Hi, guys.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.600
Charter one. Six people.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.000
So primary charter guest, Dave,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.200
the owner of San Francisco's
first trampoline park.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.200
- We'll have to bust out
that trampoline then for him.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.467
- Or not. Maybe he's like,
"Ugh, not another trampoline."

17:46.467 --> 17:48.567
- He's a big adventure junkie.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.433
He's chartering the yacht with
his wife Amy and their friends,

17:50.433 --> 17:53.467
who also share the same passion
for extreme stuff.

17:56.734 --> 17:59.333
- Yeah.
Did you see Dave's dinner?

17:59.333 --> 18:00.467
- The steak?

18:00.467 --> 18:02.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I saw it.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.166
- [inaudible]. He says,
"I'm a meat, potato, meat guy."

18:04.166 --> 18:05.333
- I'm a meat and potatoes
kind of chef.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.767
Perfect match. Let's do this.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.233
- Beach barbecue?

18:08.233 --> 18:10.100
- Yep, that's gonna be
the second day.

18:10.100 --> 18:12.500
- You usually want the chef
on the beach.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.367
- I'm gonna leave
that up to you.

18:14.367 --> 18:17.100
- Sounds good.
- I know we've got green crew,

18:17.100 --> 18:18.300
but charter guests
don't really give a sh--

18:18.300 --> 18:20.166
how green we are.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.767
- We don't want them knowing
that either, you know?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.367
- As the captain,
you're not allowed

18:23.367 --> 18:25.233
to show your anxiety
to the crew,

18:25.233 --> 18:28.033
but right now the pucker
effect is so strong

18:28.033 --> 18:29.500
you couldn't drive
a straight pin up

18:29.500 --> 18:31.300
my ass with
a 10-pound sledgehammer.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.567
That's a wrap.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.066
- All deck crew, can you go
to the main deck aft please?

18:40.066 --> 18:42.000
If you look at our lines
here, right,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.400
this is our bowline right here.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.533
This holds the bow in.
If I say make it off,

18:47.533 --> 18:52.200
you're gonna go one loop
around like this, all right?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.533
Then figure eight.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.266
- My day work experience
was like,

18:55.266 --> 18:57.266
"This is your job
for the next 6 hours.

18:57.266 --> 19:00.133
You're gonna polish the hull."
This is a little different.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.066
- No.
- [inaudible] locking--

19:02.066 --> 19:04.400
- Well, you could lock it
off that one then. It's fine.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.133
So wrap that around like you
had it, like a figure eight.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.533
- Yeah?
- Now make it off.

19:07.533 --> 19:09.133
- There's a lot more
to being a deckhand

19:09.133 --> 19:11.266
on a boat than just polishing,

19:11.266 --> 19:13.100
and you better soak it in
on the first try because

19:13.100 --> 19:14.400
I don't want to be responsible

19:14.400 --> 19:17.000
for any harm
happening to the boat,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.133
to a human, to myself. Boom.

19:20.133 --> 19:21.500
- Holla.
- Nailed it, girl.

19:21.500 --> 19:25.266
- Quick, easy. Rodeo girl.

19:25.266 --> 19:27.033
- All crew, all crew.

19:27.033 --> 19:30.266
Dinner's ready in the crew mess.

19:30.266 --> 19:32.433
- Oh, you are too kind.

19:32.433 --> 19:34.567
- How do you say cheers
in Portuguese?

19:34.567 --> 19:37.367
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

19:37.367 --> 19:39.100
- Here we go.
- Do you want to bring it up?

19:39.100 --> 19:40.300
- I think we should.
- Okay, yeah.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.166
So we were making observations,

19:42.166 --> 19:44.500
and maybe you would be
interested

19:44.500 --> 19:47.266
in switching rooms,
just one of you.

19:47.266 --> 19:49.667
- So we would have mixed rooms?
- Mm-hmm.

19:49.667 --> 19:52.367
- Is that allowed?
- Yeah, you guys will be fine.

19:52.367 --> 19:56.300
- Later. We were great friends
for 12 hours.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.233
- Rooming with a guy means
free reign of the bathroom,

19:59.233 --> 20:01.266
the top bunk,
and a bigger closet.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.233
It'll all be worth it.

20:03.233 --> 20:05.300
- I brought one underwear.
Yeah, I don't wear underwear,

20:05.300 --> 20:07.667
so I have to change
in the bathroom.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.166
- Coming up...
- Pull your end more in.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.467
Pull it. Pull it.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.567
- All kinds of things
are happening.

20:11.567 --> 20:12.600

go up the stairs with it.

23:40.367 --> 23:42.333
Coming right behind you
with the fenders.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.633
Captain, are we gonna be
able to squeeze by you?

23:43.633 --> 23:46.433
- Nope, just stand by.
- Okay.

23:46.433 --> 23:48.033

Smarter, not harder.
- Yeah.

23:50.767 --> 23:52.500

off something?

23:52.500 --> 23:54.300
- Probably after lunch.

23:54.300 --> 23:55.500
- The higher and the more
dangerous the better.

on his back.

I'll come back out and get 'em.

F---ing idiots.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.500
All right, we got cushions
over the side.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.467
Can you snag
those cushions please?

24:18.467 --> 24:21.400
- Jesus.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.734

I thought they were.

They blew right in the water.

24:31.767 --> 24:36.266

- Chips. Runaway chips.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.533
- I got 'em.

24:37.533 --> 24:39.734
The fish will love the chips.

all of them
are clipped in in the sliders.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.367

24:49.367 --> 24:51.100
We lost those, so.

24:52.633 --> 24:54.100

24:54.100 --> 24:57.133
Seriously.
I can't get over it.

On my mark, drop.

a good one, on the back
of Captain Lee's cabin door.

25:11.633 --> 25:14.300
Can you go get that,
bring it down these stairs

25:14.300 --> 25:16.033
and then down
to the laundry room?

25:16.033 --> 25:20.700
- Okay, okay.
- And iron his black uniform.

25:20.700 --> 25:24.400
- Captain Lee's captain
is which direction?

25:27.300 --> 25:30.000
I'm raring and ready to go.
Hand me the iron.

25:31.567 --> 25:33.300

25:33.300 --> 25:35.033
- Those are the ones we lost?
- Yeah.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.700
- Damn. They're heavy, man.
- Yeah.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.567
I didn't even know
the cushions had securements,

25:38.567 --> 25:41.533

into the physical boat.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.567
- It makes sense
because it's a boat.

25:45.567 --> 25:47.467
Did we do it wrong?

25:47.467 --> 25:49.000
- I think this might be right.
- I don't think so.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.066
- A little lunch,
a little jet boarding.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.700
- Yes.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.600
- I can't wait to see it.
- I call it rocket feet.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.433
- Radish, radish, radish.
- So you're making the Caesar?

25:56.433 --> 25:58.600
- Yeah. Caesar salad is one of
my favorite things to make

25:58.600 --> 26:00.467
because I make
the dressing from scratch.

26:00.467 --> 26:04.533
If the guests don't want
some elaborate fine dining meal,

26:04.533 --> 26:06.467
why give it to them?
No, I'm gonna give 'em

26:06.467 --> 26:09.333
the best damn Caesar salad
they've ever had.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.667
- You're such a calm chef.
- Yeah.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.433
- It's refreshing.
- I try.

26:12.433 --> 26:14.066
- All right.
They have their Mountain Dew,

26:14.066 --> 26:15.467
they have their wine,
and they are ready.

26:15.467 --> 26:17.000
- Okay, all cool.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.600
- The old Mountain Dew
white wine.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.066
- It's all happening.
- Are these ready to go?

26:20.066 --> 26:21.500
- Yeah.
- Serve the ladies first.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.100
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.767
- Thank you.
- So I'll serve ladies first.

26:24.767 --> 26:26.633
- Okay.
- Since there's a third lady,

26:26.633 --> 26:28.367
will you take down for the girl
in the middle?

26:28.367 --> 26:31.367
- Okay. Hope that you're hungry.
- Wow. Oh.

26:31.367 --> 26:33.500
- Chicken Caesar salad
with tarragon.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.033
- Thank you.

26:35.033 --> 26:36.633
- Thank you.
- I said ladies first.

26:36.633 --> 26:38.600
If Jen doesn't understand that,

26:38.600 --> 26:41.033
we might be in more trouble
than I initially thought.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.567
- That looks great.
- This chicken is perfect.

26:43.567 --> 26:44.767
- Matt without pants,
the chicken is good.

26:44.767 --> 26:46.433
- Pantless Matt.

26:46.433 --> 26:47.767
- No Pants Matt.
- No Pants. Thank you.

26:47.767 --> 26:49.600
Nice work, No Pants Matt.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.767
- That's funny.
- So it was the first lunch,

26:53.767 --> 26:55.600
but, like,
serve the ladies first,

26:55.600 --> 26:57.066
and you clear the ladies first.

26:57.066 --> 26:58.367
- Okay.
- Matt, they're happy.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.500
They're loving it.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.467
- Great.
- Whatever you do,

27:01.467 --> 27:03.400
don't stand
underneath it, all right?

27:03.400 --> 27:05.200
It's 'cause it's gonna swing,
so move that table.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.667
- Back up.
- Now pull your end more in.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.400
- More in?
- Yeah, man.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.200
We're f---ing going down
with it, not sideways.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.400
Hey, pull it. Pull it, pull it.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.000
F---. Come on, guys.
Open your eyes.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.467
- Which ones?
- I'm pulling it out.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.400
Pull your end more, Chris.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.000
- I don't want to be under it.
- So don't be under it.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.633
The concept's simple, man.

27:20.633 --> 27:23.400
It's a single pivot point
and you have ropes,

27:23.400 --> 27:26.000
and you pull the thing
and you put it in the water,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.400
but I've never done this before
so of course I suck at it.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.133
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No tender.

27:31.133 --> 27:32.767
- All kinds of things
are happening.

27:32.767 --> 27:35.066
- Pull it, pull it, pull it.
- Whoa.

27:35.066 --> 27:36.100
- F--- now?

27:39.667 --> 27:40.166
- Pull it, pull it,

27:40.166 --> 27:41.033
- Pull it, pull it,
pull it, pull it.

27:41.133 --> 27:41.400
God f---ing damn it.

27:43.533 --> 27:45.166
- Whoa. All kinds of things
are happening.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.166
- Bruno, go downstairs.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.667
- Hey, Lee, Lee.
Do you mind jumping in?

27:49.667 --> 27:51.233
I just need a hand
with this please.

27:51.233 --> 27:54.033
- Yeah.
- This is a sh--show.

27:54.033 --> 27:55.233
- You drive the crane.
I'll get in.

27:55.233 --> 27:56.700
- Yeah.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.166
- How's everything so far, guys?
- Great.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.233
- So good.
- Good.

28:00.233 --> 28:02.233
- Bruno, if you and I both keep
the same amount of tension,

28:02.233 --> 28:05.166
then it keeps the boat
parallel with the big boat

28:05.166 --> 28:07.567
and he can pick it up.
Let it out.

28:07.567 --> 28:11.033
First time I worked on a yacht
was back in the late '80s.

28:11.033 --> 28:14.166
I was in so far over my head
it was just incredible,

28:14.166 --> 28:16.033
so with a green crew,

28:16.033 --> 28:19.233
I'm more than happy
to show them how to do things.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.633
Once.

28:20.633 --> 28:23.033
There you go. Good job.

28:23.033 --> 28:25.533
- Okay.
- You gonna come

28:25.533 --> 28:26.767
[inaudible] here?

28:29.166 --> 28:31.467
- I'm gonna keep saying
things about service.

28:31.467 --> 28:34.734
- Okay.
- So I like to have the table

28:34.734 --> 28:36.734
after a meal,
everything cleared.

28:36.734 --> 28:38.200
- Okay.

28:38.200 --> 28:42.033
- How's that going?
- I'm...

28:42.033 --> 28:44.066
I'm hoping I'll only
have to teach them up

28:44.066 --> 28:45.533
through this first charter.

28:45.533 --> 28:46.533
- Yeah.
- So what did we say?

28:46.533 --> 28:48.033
7:30 what, start?

28:48.033 --> 28:49.700
- Yeah.
- Hook me up with it.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.166
No worries. It's gonna be fine.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.734
- We'll figure it out.
- Yeah.

28:52.734 --> 28:54.200
- You don't want that really
too tight either

28:54.200 --> 28:56.033
'cause it's gonna
hurt you here, so.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.567
But I know how
to read a guest

29:02.567 --> 29:05.734
and treat them well
and talk to them.

29:05.734 --> 29:08.467
- Here we go.
- Yeah. Whoo!

29:08.467 --> 29:11.200
- Told you.
Gonna get it.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.767
It's a nice feeling
when you're up there.

29:12.767 --> 29:14.533
You really feel
like you're flying.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.100
- Go really high?
- Yeah.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.233
- Good job, Davey.
- Do you think

29:20.233 --> 29:22.300
are we doing great or not?
I have no clue. Like,

29:22.300 --> 29:25.633
is Nico's happy or we're
doing sh-- all the time?

29:25.633 --> 29:26.767
- I don't know. Poor Nico,
and I guess

29:26.767 --> 29:28.700
I'm the second-most experienced.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.100
The fact that I am the
second-most experienced person

29:32.100 --> 29:35.567
on deck after Nico
is a little bit scary.

29:35.567 --> 29:38.166
I guess I'm just gonna have
to adapt and step it up.

29:38.166 --> 29:42.300
Considering the circumstances,
like, we're doing all right.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.667
- Yeah, right?

29:45.100 --> 29:47.567
- Argh! Oh, my legs.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.767
- Thanks a lot for coming out.
- Oh, God.

29:51.533 --> 29:52.567
- [sighs]

29:58.667 --> 30:01.533
- All deck [inaudible], go ahead
and change over.

[upbeat music]

30:04.533 --> 30:08.266
♪ ♪

30:08.266 --> 30:09.767
- Have you set tables
very often?

30:09.767 --> 30:11.533
- Just on my last boat.

30:11.533 --> 30:13.266
- You'll be setting lots
of tables this season.

30:13.266 --> 30:16.133
- Cool.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.767
- Oh, God. So we can eat?
- Yeah.

30:18.767 --> 30:21.333
- Oh, God. I'm so tired.
I can't feel my legs.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.100
I'm really, really hurt
in my legs.

30:23.100 --> 30:28.633
- Drink some water.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.567
- The dresses, ladies.
You look awesome.

30:32.567 --> 30:34.100
- I know.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.166
We're all lovely
in the ocean breeze.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.700
- You look beautiful.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.433
- The primaries are out
of their cabin,

30:38.433 --> 30:39.700
so I'm gonna have you go
to the master and start the

30:39.700 --> 30:41.400
turndown. Watch your head.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.133
Hey, hon, will you just
go check on the guests?

30:43.133 --> 30:44.300
- Sure.
- The Flyboard today?

30:44.300 --> 30:46.033
- Yeah?
- Pretty fun.

30:46.033 --> 30:47.700
- That was very fun.
- That was awesome.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.767
- Is your bucket list shrinking
or is it growing?

30:48.767 --> 30:50.300
- Oh, it's growing.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.667
I'd really like
to climb Kilimanjaro.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.567
- Can I get you something
to drink, [inaudible]?

30:54.567 --> 30:55.567
- A glass of Sauvignon
blanc, please.

30:55.567 --> 30:57.567
- Sauvignon blanc.

30:57.567 --> 30:59.233
- Can I get a Mountain Dew?
- We both love to do the Dew.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.300
- I'll have a gin martini
with olives, thanks.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.166
- Absolutely. Thanks.

31:02.166 --> 31:05.033
- I might be a tiny bit drunk.
Give me a martini.

31:05.033 --> 31:09.033
- Sauvignon blanc and gin
and tonic with olives.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.100
- Gin martini with olives.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.667
- Absolutely.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.000
- Okay,
there's wine glasses out there.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.667
- Okay.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.033
- I'll give you the gin
and tonic real quick.

31:20.734 --> 31:22.400
- Do you have any little
beverage napkins in here

31:22.400 --> 31:23.734
that I can--
- Don't worry about it.

31:23.734 --> 31:27.066
- Okay. Thank you. Here you go.

31:27.066 --> 31:28.700
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.000
- That looks different.
I don't think that's--

31:30.000 --> 31:31.200
- Sauvignon blanc?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.333
- Is that a martini?
- No.

31:32.333 --> 31:34.333
I think it's a gin and tonic.

31:34.333 --> 31:37.166
- Is it good? The drink is okay?
- Well, this isn't a martini.

31:37.166 --> 31:39.333
- So demanding.
- Just gin and vermouth.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.600
- Yeah, sorry.
- That's okay.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.200
- I didn't make the drink.
I just passed it on.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.200
- Oh, okay. You just brought it.
All right.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.734
- Yeah. Just delivery.
Don't kill the messenger.

31:48.734 --> 31:53.000
- So she said this--brought it
to her and she was like--I said,

31:53.000 --> 31:54.200
"Is your drink okay?"
And she goes,

31:54.200 --> 31:56.100
"Oh, well, it's not a martini,"

31:56.100 --> 31:58.100
and I'm like,
"You didn't say that."

31:58.100 --> 32:00.100
- Oh, that's a gin and tonic.
Did she ask for a martini?

32:00.100 --> 32:01.233
- Apparently.
- Okay.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.166
Can you go up in the upper bar

32:03.166 --> 32:05.233
and look for olives
in a skinnier jar [inaudible]?

32:05.233 --> 32:06.767
- Okay. Okay.

32:06.767 --> 32:08.633
- When you hear gin
and tonic and olives,

32:08.633 --> 32:10.233
usually it's like
that Sesame Street.

32:10.233 --> 32:12.233
One of these things
does not belong here.

32:12.233 --> 32:14.233
It's either gin and tonic and
lime or gin martini with olives.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.767
I should've known better,
but I'm a little overwhelmed.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.700
I swear we're coming.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.767
- Yeah, no worries.
- Here you go.

32:24.767 --> 32:28.367
- Thank you.
- Better?

32:28.367 --> 32:32.100
- Yes, yes.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.734
- I can start taking 'em out
when you're ready.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.233
- All right.
This is the principles here.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.000
We're gonna give 'em
the well done.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.133
This first dinner
is extremely important.

32:39.133 --> 32:40.400
Cooking exactly what the guests

32:40.400 --> 32:42.200
want will guarantee
their happiness,

32:42.200 --> 32:43.533
and that's all
that matters to me.

32:43.533 --> 32:45.233
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

32:45.233 --> 32:47.100
- Serve from the left,
ladies first.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.000
- Here you go.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
- Wow.
- Oh, my gosh.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.734
It looks beautiful.

32:51.734 --> 32:54.333
- Here you have a seared filet
with Dijon mashed potato

32:54.333 --> 32:57.033
and buttered asparagus.
- Yum.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.400
- How is your steak, everybody?
Is it cooked all right?

33:00.400 --> 33:02.133
- It is delicious.

33:02.133 --> 33:03.133
- Good, I'm so glad
to hear that. Good.

33:03.133 --> 33:04.400
- Yeah, thank you.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.266
- Thanks, No Pants.
- Cheers.

33:06.266 --> 33:09.133
- They're so happy, by the way.
- Good. Thank you.

33:09.133 --> 33:11.266
- Have you guys been practicing,
like, the bowline and stuff?

33:11.266 --> 33:13.400
- Yeah, I have.
I mean, like, to be honest,

33:13.400 --> 33:17.233
I'm just really
too exhausted, but--

33:17.233 --> 33:21.700
- No. No. Right here.
In, around,

33:21.700 --> 33:25.166
and back in the same exact place
that you came from, right?

33:25.166 --> 33:28.000
You've got 24 hours in a day.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.533
Surely you can learn
a simple knot.

33:29.533 --> 33:31.433
- I'm tired.

33:31.433 --> 33:33.433
My brain is just overwhelmed
with so much information.

33:33.433 --> 33:35.300
This is hard work.

33:35.300 --> 33:38.767
- I need you guys
to really f---ing get with it.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.033
- Coming up...

33:41.033 --> 33:43.433
- Bruno, unhook it.
Unhook it. Take it off.

33:43.433 --> 33:45.300
No, no, no. Stop.
Stop. Stop moving.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.533
- Bruno.
- He's just f---ing lost.

33:52.200 --> 33:52.567
- [inaudible]'s cool.

33:52.567 --> 33:55.066

You should definitely go.

33:57.400 --> 33:57.567
With these

33:57.567 --> 33:58.233
With these
stewardesses I just feel like

34:00.200 --> 34:02.300
if I don't check
something myself,

34:02.300 --> 34:04.467
I cannot be certain
that it's correct.

34:04.467 --> 34:07.000
Basically, I'm working alone.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.467
I'm gonna leave you a list
to set up breakfast.

34:09.467 --> 34:11.266
You'll on deck at 6:30.

34:11.266 --> 34:14.467
- Okay.
- Goodnight, guys.

34:17.467 --> 34:22.066
- That went well.
- How are you doing, Nico?

34:22.066 --> 34:25.133
- Good, good.
- Your first time down here?

34:25.133 --> 34:27.433
- I've been down here months.
- Wow.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.467
- Yeah, just working
on a 100-foot.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.166
It was an unpleasant
few months, yeah.

34:32.166 --> 34:33.467
Especially, you know,
I got a lot going on

34:33.467 --> 34:35.333
with my family and everything,

34:35.333 --> 34:38.066
so I flew down right
after everything, so, you know.

34:38.066 --> 34:40.066
- I know.
I'm sorry for that, buddy.

34:40.066 --> 34:41.333
- Nah.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.066
You know,
life gets crazy sometimes.

34:44.066 --> 34:48.467
Last November, unfortunately,
my 21-year-old little brother

34:48.467 --> 34:53.500
had fallen from a balcony
and hit his head pretty good,

34:53.500 --> 34:56.233
and yeah, unfortunately
he passed away,

34:56.233 --> 35:00.567
and, you know,
he was my best friend.

35:00.567 --> 35:03.066
You think that, you know,
maybe you're just dreaming.

35:03.066 --> 35:05.100
Maybe that this isn't real.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.600
You know, I still try
and call his phone

35:06.600 --> 35:09.400
and he doesn't pick up,
and he's never going to.

35:11.367 --> 35:14.200
- Can't imagine what you went
through, but my heart goes out.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.233
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you.

35:16.233 --> 35:20.000
It's hard for me
to just be here at all.

35:21.233 --> 35:24.166
It's been a f---ing
hard 3 months.

when they don't know

the wall, and the sea bobs in.

39:37.533 --> 39:39.200
- Put those through
the hawsepipe,

39:39.200 --> 39:40.433

to tie them on the boat.

fall off this thing.

40:42.367 --> 40:43.700

40:43.700 --> 40:46.467

- Yeah, I fell coming on.

40:46.467 --> 40:49.300

40:52.300 --> 40:53.333
- Mm-hmm.

40:55.767 --> 41:00.533
The only time I run
is to escape a beach party.

41:00.533 --> 41:03.734
Oh, God. Get me off the island.

41:03.734 --> 41:06.600
- Man.
- How's it going over there?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.767
- I'm a solo stew right now.
- Oh.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.533
- This is borderline dangerous.

41:10.533 --> 41:12.667
- Dangerous for my health
and mental well-being.

41:12.667 --> 41:15.533
- You know, any issues that Nico
and I may have had in the past

41:15.533 --> 41:17.533
we're gonna have to
leave them in the past

41:17.533 --> 41:19.633
because at this point
we really only have each other

41:19.633 --> 41:21.633
because he has experience,

41:21.633 --> 41:23.333
and that's more than I can say
about the rest of the crew.

41:48.667 --> 41:51.567
- I'm not your bitch, bitch.
- Open it!

41:51.567 --> 41:53.700
- These are, without a doubt,
the most demanding guests.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.433
- What do you think, Brad?

41:55.433 --> 41:57.033
- Truth be told,
it's not cooked enough.

41:57.033 --> 41:59.367
- It's not my job to tell a chef
how to do his.

41:59.367 --> 42:01.367
You should do the caviar
and oysters together.

42:01.367 --> 42:02.700
- If you're gonna throw
that thing, get it to

42:02.700 --> 42:04.567
the goddamn dock.

42:04.567 --> 42:06.533
- My deck crew is greener
than a leprechaun's dick.

42:08.767 --> 42:10.567
- Who?
- Bri. I f---ing want

42:10.567 --> 42:12.033
to bang her.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.400
- Ooh, we're getting
loose tonight.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.433
L-l-loose.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.033
- Don't screw the crew
doesn't apply on this boat.

42:17.033 --> 42:18.066
It's a loose rule.

42:20.133 --> 42:22.533
- I will sleep with Jesus
on a sailboat.

42:22.533 --> 42:25.066
What would Jesus do? Me.

42:25.066 --> 42:28.533
- I've got no bow thruster.
- Oh, f---.

42:28.533 --> 42:30.567
- I don't know if he's gonna
lose his hand or what.

42:30.567 --> 42:33.166
- I don't really think Nico's
the best leader.

42:33.166 --> 42:35.600
- That anchor drop
was f---ing embarrassing.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.467
- I'm going to f---ing
unleash on you,

42:37.467 --> 42:39.433
you stupid f---ing bitch.

42:39.433 --> 42:41.734
- If it were just me,
I would feel bad firing them.

42:41.734 --> 42:43.734
- I'm not gonna talk back
to you. I'm sorry.

42:43.734 --> 42:45.433
Is this good for you?

42:45.433 --> 42:47.200
- Captain Lee loves
firing people.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.400
- I don't need your sh-- either!

42:49.400 --> 42:51.467
- There's gonna be a change in
the configuration of this crew.

42:51.467 --> 42:54.667
- If tomorrow I'm not
boatswain, I quit.

42:54.667 --> 42:57.200
- I got a spring line out there.
- Watch the bow! Watch the bow!

42:57.200 --> 42:59.667
- I need the spring line--
- Okay, okay.

42:59.667 --> 43:02.734
- Did we hit something?
- Goddamn it!
