WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.459
(siren wailing in distance)

00:04.505 --> 00:07.918
(man) J‘ You and me,
we're not the same J‘

00:07.966 --> 00:11.458
— What are you doing?
— (Andy) Putting on my shirt.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.753
Ah. Iwouldn't have
made you for shy.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.296
I'm not being shy.
I'm just... you know...

00:18.101 --> 00:20.638
Wire's off.
Camera's off, Andy.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.722
Prove it.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.057
Happy?

00:27.110 --> 00:28.975
(giggles) Very.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.894
Grapefruit or cranberry?

00:30.948 --> 00:31.937
Orange.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.491
Grapefruit.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.573
I'm never doing this again.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.494
I think you said that the last time.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.910
Hey, you're the one that called me.
I don't even have your number.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.703
Too risky, all right?

00:47.756 --> 00:49.747
The less you know about
what I'm doing, the better.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.131
I don't even know anything.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.962
I mean, other than the fact
that you hang out in dive bars

00:53.011 --> 00:55.798
and flash cash, make friends
with Jamie Brennan.

00:55.847 --> 00:59.089
Hey, that guy is no joke.
Forget you ever met that guy.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.554
Okay. I don't need
to know anything.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.312
You know, unlike Sam,
J.D. is a perfect gentleman.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.689
— Brings me juice to bed...
— Mm—hmm.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.817
holds my hand,
and he actually calls me.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.817
Well, J.D.'s an open book.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.197
— Oh, really?
— Yeah.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.154
Mm—hmm.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.659
What do you wanna know?

01:19.705 --> 01:21.536
Favorite ice cream.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.914
— What?
— What?

01:23.959 --> 01:26.496
That's your first question?
I'm a badass drug smuggler,

01:26.545 --> 01:27.830
and that's what you wanna know?

01:27.879 --> 01:29.835
What? Everybody likes ice cream.
Everyone has a favorite.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.712
— Okay, pistachio.
— Except for that.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.669
— No one chooses pistachio, ever.
— Yes.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.129
J.D. was 6 years old.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.555
He went to visit his father
in Maplehurst Penitentiary.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.681
It was the first time he ever met the guy,
so he was a little nervous.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.182
But when he got in there,

01:42.227 --> 01:44.183
his dad gave him
a pint of pistachio ice cream.

01:44.229 --> 01:49.394
They ate it together,
and he wasn't so nervous anymore.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.435
J‘ La—la, la—la, la—la,
la—la—la J‘

01:52.487 --> 01:54.614
J‘ There's something
to consider J‘

01:54.656 --> 01:59.525
J‘ When you come for dinner
at my place J‘

02:02.623 --> 02:04.579
(grunting)

02:04.625 --> 02:06.411
(exhales deeply)

02:07.753 --> 02:09.744
You, uh, you all right?

02:09.796 --> 02:12.003
(exhaling) Fine.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.710
And does your physio know
you're lifting this much weight?

02:13.759 --> 02:15.215
I mean, you're supposed
to be strengthening your back,

02:15.260 --> 02:17.296
not injuring it again.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.586
Ohh!

02:19.890 --> 02:21.505
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, man.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.674
It was my bad. I should've had that.
Are you okay?

02:23.727 --> 02:26.639
Yeah, I'm fine.
Wicked plan, though.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.973
W—What do you mean?

02:28.023 --> 02:29.934
Give your buddy faulty barbells,

02:29.983 --> 02:33.601
weight slips, bam.
EX—buddy killed instantly.

02:33.654 --> 02:38.023
W—Wait. You——
You know I would never...

02:38.075 --> 02:40.612
I'm kidding.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.868
— I mean, you gotta know——
— It's a bad joke. I'm sorry.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.413
Look, Chris,

02:54.466 --> 02:56.377
I really screwed things up with Gail.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.882
I'm sorry.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.010
Yeah. Now, don't——

03:01.181 --> 03:03.388
— Look, it is what it is.
— Okay?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.684
Yeah. Okay.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.715
Okay.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.384
Uaughs)

03:07.437 --> 03:09.598
(sighs) Feels good
to be back to normal.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.434
Got that right, brother.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.815
"Brother"?
You sound just like Oliver.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.361
Next thing I know, you're gonna
be asking me to buy you lunch.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.316
(imitating Oliver)
Nice! If I want your opinion, Diaz,

03:18.365 --> 03:22.153
I'll ask for it. Now go get me
a sandwich. No pickles!

03:22.202 --> 03:23.658
All right. Okay, I got one.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.194
(imitates Swarek)
You wanna know the rules,

03:25.247 --> 03:28.034
go ask your mother,
'cause I don't play by the rules.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.619
— Swarek?
— Yeah!

03:29.668 --> 03:31.329
Uh, it was good. It was good.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.243
Okay, I got——| got another one.
I got another one.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.673
(imitating Noelle) Okay. Are you
sucking up to me, Peck? Huh?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.001
'Cause I don't mind,
just long as you know

03:37.050 --> 03:39.382
it's not gonna get you anywhere...

03:39.428 --> 03:41.259
with... me.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.467
That's not how you do Noelle.
Noelle is more like, uh...

03:44.516 --> 03:46.427
(imitating Noelle)
Are you sucking up to me, Peck?

03:46.476 --> 03:49.092
'Cause that is not
gonna get you jack.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.431
Just, uh, getting my gym bag.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.528
Looks like she's been
living out of that gym bag.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.031
Yeah, I didn't even know
she had a gym bag, actually.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.745
All right.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.573
(beep)

04:09.958 --> 04:12.244
Ella Jane Tulip is a bitch.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.580
Well, with a name like that...

04:14.629 --> 04:17.245
Who is she?
A prostitute? Junkie?

04:17.299 --> 04:18.539
Leo's classmate.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.799
What, you're mad
at a second grader?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.300
That was Leo's teacher
on the phone,

04:22.345 --> 04:24.131
and my son is refusing
to go to school

04:24.181 --> 04:26.092
because this Tulip girl's
been picking on him.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.053
Trace, kids pick on each other.
It's the circle of life.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.058
Derek McKinley called me
Jerry Barbie

04:31.104 --> 04:33.345
until I was in high school.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.686
You want me to send a couple guys
over there, rough her up?

04:36.735 --> 04:39.351
lt's tempting, but no.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.941
I already told Leo that fighting back
is not the answer.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.322
There is good in everyone.
You just have to find it.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.777
Oh, so you lied to him.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.071
Trace, one thing
that I've learned in this job

04:50.123 --> 04:52.114
is to expect the worst
out of everyone,

04:52.167 --> 04:54.749
and if I'm wrong, great.
But some people——

04:54.795 --> 04:57.832
a lot of people——
are just plain bad.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.839
I choose to believe in the fundamental
goodness of human nature.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.545
You called a 7—year—old a bitch.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.835
In a moment of weakness,
and | feel better. Thank you.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.049
Okay.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.886
You, uh, working
the afternoon shift?

05:10.936 --> 05:12.267
No, I already told you.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.722
I took the day off
to finalize my mortgage.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.263
Right, right, right, right.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.808
So, uh, which one did you buy?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.522
You know the one on the corner
with all the windows?

05:21.571 --> 05:24.313
I actually showed Sam all the pictures
before he disappeared.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.152
I remember. It's beautiful.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.066
Thanks. You wanna come?

05:29.746 --> 05:33.034
lwish I could, but, uh, I gotta
turn these cameras back on

05:33.083 --> 05:34.573
and start behaving.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.116
Another eight hours without a wire,

05:36.169 --> 05:37.830
Boyd might actually notice.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.085
Yeah.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.418
— I'm gonna miss you.
— How long's it gonna be?

05:42.467 --> 05:45.630
(knock on door)

05:51.184 --> 05:52.515
Yeah?

05:52.561 --> 05:54.722
(Jamie) lt's Brennan.
I brought coffee.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.097
J.D., come on.
Open the door.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.065
(whispers) What?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.106
(knock on door)

06:04.155 --> 06:06.487
Coffee's getting cold.
Open up.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.194
What?

06:12.122 --> 06:14.113
So... how are things?

06:14.165 --> 06:17.453
What, like you don't know
every single detail?

06:17.502 --> 06:19.584
I'm not sure I wanna know
every detail.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.665
I'm just asking how things are,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.582
since, you know, you and Chris——

06:24.634 --> 06:26.920
Why does everyone care so much?

06:26.970 --> 06:29.632
You're lucky your life is so quaint.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.046
Quaint?

06:31.099 --> 06:33.806
Stable, solid,
not worth gossiping about.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.433
No offense.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.639
Why would I take offense, Gail?

06:37.689 --> 06:39.680
(dispatcher on radio)
Home invasion in progress.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.849
193 Dowling.
Suspect is still on scene.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.144
Car 1504 responding.
We're on it.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.902
(siren wailing)

06:46.948 --> 06:48.813
(woman speaking excitedly, indistinct)

06:51.453 --> 06:53.318
(Dov)
Calm down. What happened?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.532
I heard gunshots
in the apartment right above me.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.198
— lt's apartment 202.
— Stay there. Stay here.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.116
1504 on scene at 193 Dowling.
Going in.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.660
(dispatcher) Copy that.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.210
(dog barking in distance)

07:16.895 --> 07:19.227
(man speaking, indistinct)

07:30.075 --> 07:32.737
This is the police!
We know you're in here.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.777
Identify yourself.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.157
Police! Don't move!

08:15.203 --> 08:16.534
Please don't shoot!
I'll do anything you want!

08:16.579 --> 08:18.240
Just don't kill me.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.002
Nothing.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.670
Okay, I'm gonna check the other room.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.340
l'll——l'll do anything you say.
Just don't shoot me.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.883
You don't have to keep
saying that, okay?

08:39.936 --> 08:42.598
We're not gonna shoot you.
Come on.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.765
(Traci on radio) Place is clear, but we have
a body in the upstairs apartment.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.104
Oh, my God. Kevin.
She——She killed him.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.146
— Who killed him?
— One of you guys——a cop.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.358
A police officer?
Are you sure?

08:53.408 --> 08:55.023
Her——Her name tag was right here.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.239
— What was her name?
— Peck. Her name was Peck.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.450
What?

09:06.921 --> 09:09.788
So, our witness says
he ran through here,

09:09.841 --> 09:12.332
— then jumped to the unit below?
— Mm—hmm.

09:13.595 --> 09:14.960
All right.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.503
Uh...

09:16.556 --> 09:18.842
single bullet wound
straight through the heart.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.883
Looks amateur to me.
Look how many times the shooter missed.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.394
I thought you were
a better shot than that, Peck.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.305
(laughter)

09:27.358 --> 09:29.189
Well, what do you know?
Kevin Reynolds.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.442
Dealer with a bad attitude.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.150
Guys in 27 liked him
for a drive—by last year

09:34.199 --> 09:35.279
but couldn't make it stick.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.361
Hey, Nash,
you run this down to the car.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.366
Put it through the CPlC.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.743
— Yes, sir.
— Thank you.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.992
Now this blood over here——
that's not his.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.373
It's too far away from the body.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.794
Well, the other guy——
the scaredy—cat witness——

09:46.836 --> 09:48.417
he didn't have a scratch
on him, Luke.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.704
Okay, well, maybe the, uh, shooter
got hit in the exchange.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.248
Hey, guys, can we get a piece of this?
Take it down to the lab.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.713
See if our "Officer Peck"
is in the system.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.627
You know I didn't have
anything to do with this.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.217
— Yeah, yeah, I'm fairly convinced.
— Good.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.928
Yeah, but, you know,
the thing I really wanna know

10:02.977 --> 10:06.435
is why someone's running around
in your uniform shooting drug dealers.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.899
Nice place.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.609
Thanks.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.903
Ooh. "Moby Dick." impressive.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.242
Not really.
Helps put me to sleep.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.782
Yeah, you know what's funny?
I've got that same lamp.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.201
Uaughs)

10:29.254 --> 10:31.461
Is that why you're here, boss——
to compare home furnishings?

10:31.506 --> 10:33.042
No, I'm here to make it clear
that nobody does business

10:33.091 --> 10:35.707
out of my warehouse
without talking to me first.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.261
O...kay.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.294
I'm serious.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.679
Guys say you can get
practically anything you want.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.760
I'm wondering
how exactly that happens.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.425
"God's Good Grace".

10:45.478 --> 10:47.969
(laughs)
What does that mean?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.604
That's the name of my boat.
lt's docked at the Harbourfront.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.317
Just let me know.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.901
Oh, thank you.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.861
lwas in.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.821
That didn't turn out so well.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.156
How do you mean?

11:04.205 --> 11:06.787
Uh, long story.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.619
I got time.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.454
Look, you probably know the gist of it.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.040
Okay, humor me.
What have the guys told you?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.625
— They say you're a fair boss.
— Uh—huh.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.130
They say you've had a rough year.

11:17.594 --> 11:21.553
Tell you about my, uh, wife?
My little girl?

11:21.598 --> 11:24.510
Yeah. Sorry.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.972
You wanna grab, uh,
something to eat?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.638
I got nothing here, but there's
a half—decent diner around the corner.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.516
Nah. I'm good.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.480
— You sure?
— Yeah.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.946
Wouldn't wanna intrude.

11:43.995 --> 11:47.988
So... when are you
gonna let me meet her?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.416
(door opens)

11:52.462 --> 11:55.078
— Did you get us coffee, babe?
— Hey.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.632
Uh, Candice?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.758
Jamie, right?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.885
Yeah, we met the other night
at the bar.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.341
You remember. l'm touched.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.553
I mean, kicked my ass in pool.
How could I forget?

12:08.478 --> 12:11.766
To Candice.
Thanks to you, boss.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.275
There's an armed killer on the loose,

12:21.324 --> 12:23.736
wearing an official police uniform——

12:23.785 --> 12:27.073
a uniform that belongs
to an officer in this division——

12:27.121 --> 12:29.612
— my division.
— Yes, sir.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.281
How?

12:31.334 --> 12:34.246
I believe the uniform was stolen
from my car last night.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.671
You of all people should know
not to leave your uniform

12:35.713 --> 12:37.214
in the car in clear view.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.841
lfl had known, I would have
reported it right away. I...

12:40.885 --> 12:42.967
| forgot it was in my car.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.388
You have three uniforms, Peck.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.386
How hard is it to keep track
of three uniforms?

12:46.432 --> 12:48.343
Yeah. l——l thought one
was in the dry cleaner's

12:48.393 --> 12:50.349
and the other one was
at a place | used to live,

12:50.395 --> 12:52.727
and l——l knew that for sure
that this was in my locker, so——

12:52.772 --> 12:56.685
Stop! There is no excuse for this.
You understand me?

13:00.446 --> 13:01.982
Officer Nash.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.817
Detective. What's this?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.527
This is Kevin Reynolds' cell phone.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.157
We have to find someone to notify.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.535
Yeah, we have a long file on him.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.287
There's just nothing in the system
about a next of kin,

13:12.333 --> 13:14.198
so, uh, I'd start with the speed dial.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.295
(Noelle) Hey, vigilante mama.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.503
Officer Peck, I got a guy, uh,
double—parked over here on Carlton.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.508
Can you go issue him a ticket,
with extreme prejudice?

13:24.554 --> 13:27.261
— Yeah.
— (both chuckle)

13:27.307 --> 13:28.513
Peck, you got a minute?

13:28.558 --> 13:31.550
Uh, can it wait? I'm just on my way
to go murder somebody.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.510
| just have some questions.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.889
This is from the one camera
in the lobby that actually works.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.853
Yeah, I've never seen her before.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.279
You didn't notice anybody
hanging around your car last night?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.529
No, the street
was completely empty.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.530
All right, where were you
coming from?

13:47.368 --> 13:48.278
Why?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.035
Someone may have followed you,
targeted you——

13:51.080 --> 13:52.365
somebody who knew
you were a cop.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.871
No one was targeting me.
I was alone.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.453
l was just, you know,
visiting someone.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.163
Private dwelling on Hingston Street.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.998
All right, then. Address.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.835
333 Hingston Street.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.676
Celeste, the all—night psychic?

14:06.721 --> 14:08.131
What, you know her?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.967
Yeah, we used her on
a missing persons case last year.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.056
— You know, she's not very good.
— Yeah. No kidding.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.063
l... I think she put a curse on me.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.275
ljust, l...

14:24.280 --> 14:25.144
How tall are you?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.483
5'7"_

14:26.532 --> 14:28.318
— And weight.
— 120.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.654
Suspect we're looking for
was wearing your uniform, so——

14:30.703 --> 14:32.113
Fine. 130.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.903
(sighs)

14:33.956 --> 14:36.618
| just couldn't get on the plane.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.159
I tried to leave, and I ended up
missing the plane, and I stayed.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.623
Glad you did.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.583
Woman like you doesn't knock
on my door every day.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.591
True. (laughs)

14:46.636 --> 14:49.048
Augh. You probably think we're crazy.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.884
No, | get it.
Sometimes you just know.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.219
Excuse the interruption.
You two have fun today.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.769
I gotta go.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.393
Okay. See ya.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.144
Thanks for dropping by, boss.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.146
Yeah, we'll talk later.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.070
(door closes)

15:08.116 --> 15:10.072
Okay, this is really bad, okay?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.074
I gotta get outta here. I gotta go!

15:12.120 --> 15:13.985
— Not for another 15 minutes.
— 15 minutes? Why?

15:14.038 --> 15:15.949
Because we have to make sure
he's gone. Do you understand?

15:15.998 --> 15:18.660
Are you sure 15 minutes
is even enough, huh?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.743
Uh, maybe 20.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.411
What? (laughs)

15:23.464 --> 15:25.455
(Dov) Okay, ma'am.
Thank you very much.

15:25.508 --> 15:26.918
(woman) I don't have
any guns on me.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.674
Nothing.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.096
Multiple gunshots.
One dead body.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.256
Some guy jumps out of a window,
and no witnesses?

15:34.308 --> 15:36.344
Basic survival instinct.
People keep to themselves.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.806
Nobody talks.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.971
Well, Gail says there's
a witness on this floor.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.604
He was on the stainNell
when they arrived on the scene.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.982
It's a good thing she was on patrol
when it happened.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.938
— Why?
— Perfect alibi.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.775
Well, nobody would actually think
Gail would be capable of murder.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.065
Well, "nice" wasn't exactly
her strong suit.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.198
"Mean", on the other hand...

15:54.203 --> 15:57.070
I've never met someone
who could dish it out like Gail Peck.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.114
(laughs)
She is kinda awesome.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.412
Jonathan Gupta.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.794
G—U—P—T—A.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.500
I heard a commotion
and peeked down the stairs

16:06.549 --> 16:09.291
to see what was the matter.
Then I heard the gunshots.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.880
A moment later, I saw
the lady officer running away.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.591
I hope she is okay.
I want to thank you

16:14.640 --> 16:17.757
for trying to rid this building
of all these drug—dealing bastards.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.141
Well, actually, that first officer——

16:19.187 --> 16:20.893
So sorry you were only able
to shoot one of them.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.394
Actually, that first officer wasn't——

16:22.440 --> 16:24.146
Sir, did you say
"all those drug—dealing bastards"?

16:24.192 --> 16:27.309
— Well, you shot Kevin, right?
— Well, not us, exactly.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.522
And Carson threw himself
through the window——

16:29.572 --> 16:32.814
not to his death, unfortunately.
But you did arrest him, yes?

16:34.202 --> 16:36.033
Well, that leaves Danny.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.455
— Who's Danny?
— I don't know his last name.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.079
He lives in one of
the townhouses

16:40.124 --> 16:42.991
across from the park——
used to be a nice kid.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.831
Now he's a drug—dealing bastard
like the others.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.087
— Did you see Danny this morning?
— No, I didn't.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.499
But you will let me know if you manage
to track him down and shoot him, yes?

16:53.221 --> 16:54.836
Anything else I can do for you?

16:54.889 --> 16:56.470
— Oh.
— Thank you very much.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.052
Thank you.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.061
Do you know this person?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.438
Uh, yeah, she's the cop
who tried to kill me this morning.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.645
Cop impersonator.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.195
(scoffs) Yeah, whatever.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.275
We have reason to believe there was
somebody else in the apartment——

17:13.324 --> 17:16.737
another dealer named Danny
working for you and Kevin Reynolds.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.947
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.611
(chuckles)
You got nothing on me.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.281
Actually, we've got you breaking
into the apartment downstairs.

17:23.334 --> 17:26.622
— I told you. The cop came in.
— Yeah.

17:26.671 --> 17:31.836
She pulled out a gun.
I... ran.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.340
That's it.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.718
We know the shooter is
the approximate height and weight

17:35.763 --> 17:37.378
of this fine officer behind you,

17:37.431 --> 17:38.591
so anything you can give us——

17:38.641 --> 17:41.633
ethnicity, hair color,
eye color——be a big help.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.687
You're Peck?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.520
Who's the other Peck?
Your sister or something?

17:50.570 --> 17:54.028
Actually...
there is no other Peck, okay?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.938
She stole my uniform,
she tried to kill you,

17:55.992 --> 17:57.402
and now she's trying
to kill this other guy.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.782
And you know what?
I really don't care if she does,

17:58.828 --> 18:01.695
but I would just rather she wasn't
wearing my uniform when she did it,

18:01.747 --> 18:04.033
so why don't you tell us
where this lowlife meth dealer is?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.914
And maybe we can save his life.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.829
Da—Danny Baker.
1--

18:10.881 --> 18:12.337
(thud)

18:12.383 --> 18:14.374
1 Parkside South.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.089
Yeah, no,
I know that I am not Kevin.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.130
I'm calling to find someone
who knows him so that l...

18:20.850 --> 18:22.056
Pardon?

18:22.101 --> 18:25.264
You kiss your mother
with that mouth? Hello?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.053
— Detective.
— Yeah.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.846
I've called 20 of the numbers
on Reynolds' phone.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.436
— 17 have hung up on me.
— Okay, what about the other 3?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.897
I hung up on them.
He's not a very popular guy.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.779
It doesn't matter. His sisters are
on their way down here, all right?

18:36.824 --> 18:38.564
They heard that some cops were
swarming around his apartment,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.028
and they wanna know
what happened.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.328
Did you tell 'em he's dead?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.782
Uh... no, 'cause we don't do
notifications on the phone,

18:43.831 --> 18:45.492
so you'll have to tell them
when they get here.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.906
You want me to do it?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.416
Yeah. You know, just use my office.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.642
Candice, where you headed?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.683
Uh... just, uh, downtown.
Queen Street.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.351
I heard it's pretty cool.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.905
All right, hop in.
I'll give you a lift.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.528
No, that's okay. I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.781
No, I insist.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.575
Yeah. If you insist.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.677
You've been in town a week,
you're only going shopping now?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.880
Been spending
a lot of time in bed.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.133
J.D.'s a lucky man.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.138
That's what I keep telling him.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.549
What I don't get is,

19:46.602 --> 19:49.560
why is he making you take a cab
to Queen Street?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.186
Oh, he's not. It's my choice.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.598
You can't go shopping
with a man hanging around,

19:53.651 --> 19:54.766
bored out of his mind,

19:54.819 --> 19:56.855
and making you feel guilty every time
you wanna try a few things on,

19:56.904 --> 19:59.611
and when you're ready to go,
you know, he's gone.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.865
Half an hour later, you find him at
an electronics store watching football.

20:03.661 --> 20:04.901
You don't like football?

20:04.954 --> 20:06.990
Where did you say you were from again?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.745
— Wisconsin.
— Right.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.747
Everybody loves football there.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.879
So, you think the shooter
knew these guys personally?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.759
Let's ask Danny Baker.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.841
He's a minor,
few counts of possession.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.676
Probably one of Kevin Reynolds'
low—level drug dealers.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.762
But this fake cop——
she is going to a lot of trouble

20:28.811 --> 20:30.722
just to take out a couple dealers.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.807
It's a crime of opportunity.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.018
Probably saw your uniform laying
in the backseat of your car,

20:35.067 --> 20:37.683
decided to steal it,
impersonate an officer,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.398
try to intimidate or kill someone.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.365
What's your take on the suspect?

20:45.411 --> 20:49.120
Well, I'm pissed that there's a killer
out there pretending to be me.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.657
But I am kind of impressed
she took down a violent drug dealer

20:52.710 --> 20:53.995
all by herself.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.374
You asked me what I thought.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.958
Hi. I'm Officer Nash.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.754
l'm Nadia. This is Sonya.
We're Kevin's sisters.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.056
What'd he do this time?

21:09.101 --> 21:11.513
We're not posting his bail again,
if that's what this is about.

21:11.562 --> 21:16.397
Um, actually, why don't we take this
somewhere a little more private?

21:22.656 --> 21:26.490
Wow, detective's office.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.787
Kevin's moving up in the world.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.992
Homicide. This looks bad.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.702
Did Kevin hurt somebody?

21:33.751 --> 21:36.367
(sighs) I'm very sorry
to inform you...

21:36.420 --> 21:38.581
that your brother is dead.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.206
How?

21:43.135 --> 21:43.965
He was shot.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.919
Who shot him?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.962
l——l can't share
all the details right now,

21:48.015 --> 21:49.971
but as soon as we find out
what's happened,

21:50.017 --> 21:51.678
I'll let you know.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.393
I'm sure this must come as a shock.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.475
Actually... no, it doesn't.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.984
Don't even get me started
on Favre, seriously.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.898
(laughs) He's the iron man
of the NFL.

22:07.952 --> 22:10.614
Don't hack on him just 'cause
he didn't finish at Green Bay.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.869
He finished his career three times.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.495
All the guy does is retire.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.452
J.D. like football?

22:15.501 --> 22:17.366
Come on. I wouldn't date anybody
who doesn't like football.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.122
He tell you he spent time in prison?

22:24.552 --> 22:26.383
He said his father did time

22:26.428 --> 22:28.339
and that, you know, these things
tend to run in the family.

22:28.389 --> 22:31.005
It doesn't take a genius
to figure out what he was saying.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.054
That didn't send you running.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.641
I didn't know him back then.
He's different now.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.445
I thought we were going downtown.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.698
We are.
Just have to make a stop first.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.909
I knew he'd end up like this.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.040
Please. It doesn't take
a genius to figure out

22:58.085 --> 23:01.623
that Kevin was gonna get himself
killed sooner or later.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.754
He was getting death threats
in junior high.

23:03.799 --> 23:07.257
— He set a neighbor's car on fire.
— With the neighbor still in it.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.090
Hid a bag of weed
at his girlfriend's house.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.470
She almost went to jail for it.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.598
He used people. Kevin didn't care
about anybody but himself.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.976
Augh, you must think we're terrible,
talking about our brother like this.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.229
No. No, no——

23:20.274 --> 23:22.765
She's a cop, Sonya.
I'm sure she's seen it all.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.561
Is there anything else?
Do you need us to sign something or...

23:26.614 --> 23:28.195
No, I guess not.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.654
Unless you can think of anybody
who might have wanted him dead.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.954
Wow. I wouldn't even know
where to start.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.580
All right,
if this Danny kid's a target,

23:45.633 --> 23:47.419
there's a chance our impostor
might already be on to him.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.299
So look sharp.
You guys got the back?

23:49.345 --> 23:50.960
Yes, sir.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.143
— Yeah?
— Danny Baker?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.103
Yeah, but, um, I can't talk now.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.484
Can you come back
when my parents are home?

24:07.529 --> 24:09.656
Danny, we have reason to believe
you might be in danger.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.033
— He's going around the back!
— We got him.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.660
(Dov) Chris, incoming.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.241
(Danny) Hey! Uhh!

24:19.583 --> 24:20.959
Let me go! I didn't do anything!

24:21.001 --> 24:22.992
Hey, chill, all right?
We're here to protect you.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.666
I don't know anything.
Let me go.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.251
Look, man.
Just take it easy, all right?

24:31.428 --> 24:34.090
Hey. Meth.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.805
Oh, Danny,
you're coming with us.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.590
Let's go.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.272
Heard you had to give
your first death notification.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.360
How was it?

24:54.410 --> 24:57.243
It was fine. Weird.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.278
I don't know.
Everybody hated the guy.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.118
Yeah. He was a meth dealer,
a menace to the neighborhood.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.583
and they looked like they were
going home to throw him a party.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.540
Uh—huh. You still think
there's good in everyone?

25:07.589 --> 25:10.296
Great. You find something good
about Kevin Reynolds,

25:10.342 --> 25:11.878
you're a better detective than I am.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.340
— Don't be so cynical.
— I'm a cop. l'm realistic.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.806
Not all cops think that way.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.138
You sure about that?

25:26.025 --> 25:30.109
So beautiful out here.
Really should come back with J.D.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.644
when it gets a bit warmer.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.779
You just met this guy.
How do you know you can trust him?

25:33.824 --> 25:37.032
I don't know. 'Cause when I met
you guys at the bar that night,

25:37.077 --> 25:40.661
it just felt like we had a connection
or something, you know?

25:57.931 --> 26:00.013
So, a girl shows up in a bar
with her stripper best friend,

26:00.059 --> 26:01.924
then shacks up with the first guy
she has a connection with?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.683
That's the story
you're trying to tell me?

26:03.729 --> 26:05.970
I'm not trying to tell you anything.

26:07.316 --> 26:09.898
Come on,
Candice from Wisconsin.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.025
Fine. Uh...

26:20.079 --> 26:23.321
my dad is an alcoholic,
and my mom left us.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.414
So I chose the route of stability.

26:26.460 --> 26:30.749
You know, I moved out,
and I got engaged to Mr. Nice Guy,

26:30.798 --> 26:32.584
and guess what?

26:32.633 --> 26:35.340
He cheated on me the week
before the wedding.

26:35.385 --> 26:38.468
So, after that,

26:38.514 --> 26:40.425
decided to get out of town
with my best friend,

26:40.474 --> 26:43.341
who, yes, is a stripper
but a very nice person regardless.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.304
We end up at a dive bar.
I meet J.D.,

26:45.354 --> 26:47.640
and for the first time
in a really long time,

26:47.689 --> 26:50.897
l was starting to have fun,
so I stayed.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.782
(opens glove compartment)

27:00.828 --> 27:02.284
Let's go.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.002
Get out.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.567
So, how long has it been?
Since you got high.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.403
Whatever.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.404
Detective Callaghan says
he's gonna be a while.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.317
I already told you
I don't know anything.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.450
Why are you keeping me here?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.282
Your parents are deceased.
You're underage.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.992
You got caught
with 2 grams of meth.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.451
Unless we find more in here.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.412
Hey, what are you doing?
That's my private stuff.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.292
— You can't do that.
— 'Course we can.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.125
Danny, we're trying to help you.
Kevin Reynolds is dead.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.257
Targeted. If you know the name
of the woman who did it,

27:58.302 --> 27:59.712
you need to tell us now.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.138
I don't know any woman!

28:02.181 --> 28:04.342
Oh, so this is yours?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.803
Who is she? Girlfriend?

28:06.852 --> 28:09.013
Maybe you two
were in on this together.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.313
Rip off your buddies,
take over the business.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.347
No, it wasn't like that.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.312
— This isn't her fault.
— Whose fault is it?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.852
lt's mine!

28:22.242 --> 28:26.656
Then Christmas, 2007,
I buy Izzy a Packers jersey.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.947
She's so happy, she cries——
cries from happiness.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.992
Uh, couple months later,
it's the Jets, then the Vikings.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.161
You have any idea how many
jerseys this guy's cost me?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.580
You see this? This is how much
I love hearing that story

28:37.633 --> 28:39.169
again and again and again.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.709
Believe me, everyone here knows
how you feel about Brett Favre.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.344
Excuse me. Sorry.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.004
— What's up, Nash?
— I need to know.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.556
and I'm just... wondering
what you think about...

28:51.605 --> 28:53.061
Look, spit it out, Nash.
What do you need?

28:53.106 --> 28:55.142
What can we help you with?
What are you wondering about?

28:55.192 --> 28:57.103
Do you believe in
the basic goodness of mankind?

28:57.152 --> 28:58.688
Trick question.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.900
Hey, hey, hey. Don'tjoke.
She's trying to be a good cop,

29:01.949 --> 29:03.234
and that's a very important question.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.526
So you agree. It is possible
to find some good in all people?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.240
No.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.278
What's going on?

29:10.332 --> 29:13.290
Detective, do you believe
that if you look hard enough,

29:13.335 --> 29:15.701
you can find good in everyone?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.870
You know I'm
a homicide detective, right?

29:17.923 --> 29:19.459
(both chuckle)

29:19.508 --> 29:21.590
Detective Callaghan?
We know who the shooter is.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.133
Your sister's name is Lindsay Baker.

29:27.182 --> 29:30.390
22 years old, works at Value Town.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.300
Didn't show up to work today.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.766
Danny, where were you
supposed to meet her?

29:38.944 --> 29:41.435
Look, we know you talked to her

29:41.488 --> 29:43.649
and that she told you
to bring her these clothes.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.564
Look, if you wanna keep
talking to him,

29:45.617 --> 29:47.073
— I'll check in with the hospitals.
— Okay.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.609
What do you mean?

29:50.122 --> 29:51.237
Your sister didn't tell you?

29:52.499 --> 29:53.864
She got shot.

29:53.917 --> 29:57.626
While she was shooting at Kevin,
I guess he decided to shoot back.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.161
I don't believe you.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.250
Okay, fine. There was a lot
of blood at the crime scene,

30:01.300 --> 30:02.915
and not all of it was Kevin's.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.005
Danny, look, your sister
is out there alone,

30:06.054 --> 30:07.590
and I know
you wanna protect her,

30:09.349 --> 30:11.055
and she needs to go to the hospital.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.930
Are you lying?

30:16.857 --> 30:19.644
No. I'm not.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.442
She's at Allan Gardens.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.653
I'm supposed to meet her there
once it got dark.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.418
You wouldn't even know
you're in the city.

30:39.463 --> 30:41.829
| used to come down here
with my wife.

30:41.882 --> 30:43.668
And then Maggie got pregnant.

30:43.717 --> 30:48.131
I'd come out and have picnics
by the lake with Gracie.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.922
House in the suburbs,
2—car garage.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.680
We thought we were
living the dream.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.512
Well, we were living the dream.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.889
What happened?

30:56.938 --> 30:57.927
They died.

30:57.981 --> 30:59.687
Car accident. Two months ago.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.098
I'm so sorry.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.312
Yeah, it was a freak accident.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.188
Well, that's what they think,
anyway. Not sure.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.317
Maybe my past came back.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.534
I wasn't always a nice guy.
I did some terrible things.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.037
Thing is, they paid the price,

31:20.087 --> 31:22.624
and all they ever did was, uh, love me.

31:24.758 --> 31:28.091
I like you——
you had a rough go of it,

31:28.136 --> 31:32.129
but, uh, now you met J.D.
Now you think you're in love.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.138
You think he's the answer.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.924
But he's not.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.558
What is he, then?

31:37.604 --> 31:38.889
He's garbage wrapped in skin.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.600
Look, I don't wanna see you get hurt.

31:40.649 --> 31:43.015
I'm not gonna get hurt.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.308
Go home.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.523
— Wisconsin's calling.
— Jamie...

31:47.572 --> 31:49.437
Look, there are a lot of hotels downtown.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.527
I don't wanna see you there tonight.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.326
Okay.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.955
Okay.

32:02.129 --> 32:05.371
(sirens wailing)

32:08.718 --> 32:10.549
Yeah, she came in a little while ago,

32:10.595 --> 32:12.711
said she needed
a place to sit for a while.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.300
I didn't realize goofing off

32:14.349 --> 32:16.431
was such a serious offense
for you guys.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.057
You know, she's not the first cop

32:18.103 --> 32:19.684
to come in here at night
and take a nap.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.515
— Which way did she go?
— I didn't see.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.476
She's gotta be around here somewhere.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.101
All right, I'll take the right.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.234
(guns cocking)

33:01.480 --> 33:03.846
— Drop the gun now.
— Where's Danny?

33:03.899 --> 33:05.355
He's fine.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.063
He's at the station. You know,
he's really worried about you.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.103
He told us where you were.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.364
You're really hurt,

33:14.409 --> 33:16.821
so why don't you put the gun down
and let me help you?

33:16.870 --> 33:20.533
No! I needed help
six months ago.

33:20.582 --> 33:23.039
Danny was using crystal meth,

33:23.084 --> 33:25.666
and then he started dealing to keep using.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.624
I found this gun in his backpack.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.756
He's 16 years old,
and this is what he carries with him.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.964
So you broke into my car
and started dressing like a cop.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.089
I put it on, and people
started listening to me.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.723
In about ten seconds,
a bunch of real cops

33:40.769 --> 33:43.226
are gonna come around that corner
and shoot you dead.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.683
Okay.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.895
Okay? But you and I both know

33:48.944 --> 33:51.981
that your brother
will never recover from that.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.191
You think we don't care,
that's fine.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.152
But he does.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.902
Lindsay, put down the weapon!

34:00.956 --> 34:02.696
(whispers) Please.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.535
I'm not gonna ask you again!

34:11.550 --> 34:13.882
— You're Peck.
— Yeah.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.464
That's my uniform you stole
and got bullet holes in.

34:16.513 --> 34:17.878
You all right?

34:17.931 --> 34:19.341
She's bleeding.
I need an EMS here.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.801
You heard her. Call it in.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.556
No. I cleaned it up already.
I put gauze on it.

34:22.602 --> 34:25.139
(man) Suspect's in custody.
EMS requested on scene.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.601
Guy at the drugstore didn't even
charge me, 'cause I'm a cop.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.357
Yeah. You're not a cop, Lindsay.

34:39.703 --> 34:43.821
So, it looks like we are both gonna be
getting out of work on time tonight.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.206
You'll be pleased to know everyone
around here agrees with you.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.493
Some people are all bad.
You win.

34:49.546 --> 34:53.084
Trace, you asked a bunch of cops
if they thought people were dirtbags.

34:53.133 --> 34:54.248
You didn't stand a chance.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.587
So, I guess I lied to my son.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.093
Okay, a couple of years ago,

34:59.139 --> 35:01.221
Kevin Reynolds was in a hit—and—run.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.052
Oh, please, Jerry,
I don't wanna hear

35:03.101 --> 35:05.763
any more horrible stuff
this guy did. I don't.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.145
He broke his wrist, and instead of
going straight to the hospital,

35:09.190 --> 35:11.772
he picked up a dog
that was hit by the other car

35:11.818 --> 35:14.560
and he carried that dog
four blocks to the vet.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.944
How do you know that?

35:15.989 --> 35:18.071
Well, l was one of the uniforms
on the scene.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.529
l tracked him to the animal hospital
on Bathurst Street.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.368
Did that really happen?

35:24.414 --> 35:27.372
I would tell Leo it did if he asked.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.711
Hey. What are you doing here?
Did you get your mortgage?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.467
— No.
— What happened?

35:39.512 --> 35:41.639
I screwed up.
I think I screwed up.

35:41.681 --> 35:42.887
I saw Sam.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.059
(sighs)
Andy, what are you think——

35:45.101 --> 35:47.137
I know.
The guy from the bar showed up.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.472
— Jamie Brennan?
— Yeah.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.313
and he ended up driving me
out to Cherry Beach.

35:53.526 --> 35:57.815
Oh, my God. "Jamie Brennan——
enforcer with the North End Guys."

35:57.864 --> 36:01.072
He's a primary suspect in...
six murder cases?

36:01.117 --> 36:02.232
That's just what they know of.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.276
I mean, two of them
were tortured to death.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.785
Did he make you as a cop?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.661
I don't know. I mean,
|——| kept it together, but, you know,

36:07.707 --> 36:10.414
maybe the real Candice
would've been really scared,

36:10.460 --> 36:12.826
you know, that some strange guy
picks her up, and l...

36:14.422 --> 36:16.674
He told me to stay away tonight.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.092
He said he was gonna
go and see Sam.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.511
— So call Sam and tell him.
— I don't have his number.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.509
I gotta tell Frank.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.466
No, you can't. They're gonna
shut down the whole operation.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.427
I can't risk this.
Okay, maybe Brennan knows.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.637
Maybe he's figured it out.
I mean, what if he hurts Sam?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.239
What's up, McNally?

36:43.284 --> 36:47.573
Sir, um, I have something
I need to tell you.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.496
How many times have you
been to his apartment?

36:53.545 --> 36:56.378
Once, after the first time.
Twice.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.505
Do you have any idea
what you've done, McNally?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.417
Not only have you embarrassed this division,

37:01.469 --> 37:03.175
and me personally,

37:03.221 --> 37:05.212
but you've jeopardized
an undercover operation

37:05.265 --> 37:06.755
that's been undenNay for months!

37:08.059 --> 37:10.220
You've put an undercover
officer's life in danger!

37:10.270 --> 37:12.556
I know. I'm sorry.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.686
Get me Guns and Gangs.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.226
Frank, you got a minute?

37:19.279 --> 37:21.520
We got a situation.
We need to talk, now.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.154
(sighs)

37:24.951 --> 37:26.111
Stay here.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.866
What is it?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.530
(speaking inaudibly)

37:35.086 --> 37:36.667
(knock on door)

37:36.713 --> 37:38.419
Who is it?

37:38.465 --> 37:40.672
(Jamie) Open up. It's me.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.474
So, what's happening?

37:52.771 --> 37:53.806
Where's, uh, Candice?

37:53.855 --> 37:55.595
Uh, she's not back yet.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.809
l was thinking about that——
that boat of yours.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.190
Okay.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.226
I thought, uh, maybe hit the Alpine,

38:01.279 --> 38:04.396
have a couple beers,
talk a little business.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.905
Yeah? Good.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.941
If you're not too busy——| don't know——
watching the football game.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.782
No, man. I'm good.
I'm not a big football guy.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.787
So, I'll meet you there, yeah?

38:13.833 --> 38:18.122
No use taking two cars.
I'm right outside.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.129
Sure.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.173
Right, thanks.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.505
Child Services is taking Danny
down to the hospital

38:26.554 --> 38:28.260
to see his sister.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.968
He's agreed to a rehab program
for kids at Sunnybrook.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.257
What about Lindsay?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.141
She'll be back on her feet
and ready for trial in no time.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.013
Okay, you know what?
Luke, I called my mom.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.477
| asked her
to pull some strings,

38:40.527 --> 38:43.940
maybe get her a half—decent
lawyer from Legal Aid.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.400
You know, Lindsay told me
that wearing the uniform

38:46.449 --> 38:49.156
made her feel
like a powerful person.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.284
God, | wish it was that easy.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.779
You are a powerful person.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.998
— That doesn't look good.
— Mm—mm.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.586
Hey. Gail.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.638
We've, uh, we've been talking.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.299
Yeah,notaboutanyﬂﬂngthat”
happened.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.967
Or didn't——or didn't happen.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.396
No, just about whether, you know,

39:17.438 --> 39:19.975
the three of us could go back
to being friends again.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.140
You know, like normal.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.694
Like the way things were before.

39:23.736 --> 39:27.228
Yeah. You were never normal.
We were never friends.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.694
But, hey, if sucking up to me
makes you feel better about yourself,

39:29.742 --> 39:31.949
knock yourselves out.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.529
She's back.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.493
Yep.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.328
(conversation, indistinct)

39:44.424 --> 39:46.289
Williams, Shaw, come with me.

39:46.342 --> 39:49.129
Okay, bring them around.
Be there in two.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.759
All right, let's go.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.056
Yeah, I got one, two,
three, four, five.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.152
Trace, what's going on?

40:05.194 --> 40:07.355
I don't know. Something about Swarek
and a problem with the wire.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.736
Give me your car keys.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.902
Here.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.279
(sirens wailing)

40:17.332 --> 40:19.744
(police radio chatter)

40:22.086 --> 40:24.122
(camera beeps, shutter clicks)

40:27.884 --> 40:31.001
(Oliver) McNally,
what are you doing here?

40:31.054 --> 40:32.794
— What is she doing here?
— (Noelle) I don't know.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.008
Don't step on the evidence. Look.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.049
All non—necessary personnel,

40:37.101 --> 40:38.682
I need you to clear
outta here, please!

40:38.728 --> 40:40.684
Jerry, what's going on?

40:40.730 --> 40:42.516
— What is she doing here?
— No.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.647
Get her outta here!
Get her outta here right now!

40:44.692 --> 40:47.434
Sam. No! Where's Sam?!

40:48.821 --> 40:50.903
Sam.
