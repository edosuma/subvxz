00:01.488 --> 00:02.711
I booked you at the Sex Stop.

00:02.722 --> 00:05.981
It's a classy sex store. They
sell books and flavored condoms.

00:05.991 --> 00:07.558
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:07.593 --> 00:10.488
I decided to partner with
Jonathan on the hotel-restaurant.

00:10.498 --> 00:13.553
Your little party-planning thing
is now a real P.R. business.

00:13.563 --> 00:15.223
She's right. It's impressive.

00:15.233 --> 00:16.501
I feel a little lost.

00:16.511 --> 00:18.813
I could actually use
some help here in the store.

00:18.847 --> 00:20.314
I think Michael's gonna love my design.

00:20.348 --> 00:22.269
Michael, Michael, Michael.

00:22.357 --> 00:23.684
Must be a pretty important man

00:23.718 --> 00:26.192
for his name to make it
into our bedroom.

00:27.349 --> 00:31.572
Uh, you really need to go, Michael. Now.

00:36.573 --> 00:39.707
So, I was researching preschools
online the other day.

00:39.717 --> 00:42.394
I know it's early, but I've heard
these things get competitive.

00:42.404 --> 00:44.538
Anyway, I noticed a lot of the schools

00:44.573 --> 00:46.707
are teaching mindfulness to children,

00:46.741 --> 00:48.231
which is fascinating, right?

00:48.241 --> 00:49.844
Well, are you telling personal stories,

00:49.878 --> 00:51.212
or is this part of the pitch?

00:51.246 --> 00:54.075
Part of the pitch. So,
I thought maybe there's a way

00:54.085 --> 00:57.026
to apply that same concept to
the physical relationship.

00:57.036 --> 00:59.453
Sort of an extension of
the whole tantric sex craze

00:59.487 --> 01:01.188
which was so big in the late '90s.

01:01.223 --> 01:03.735
Wait, wait, hey, sweetie.
I hate to stop you,

01:03.745 --> 01:06.180
but if you don't see that capitalizing

01:06.190 --> 01:09.074
on a craze from the
late '90s is a problem,

01:09.084 --> 01:11.061
then we've got a problem.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.765
Uh, it was just one idea.

01:12.775 --> 01:14.962
Truthfully, it's not even my favorite.

01:14.972 --> 01:16.566
Well, good. Pitch me your favorite.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.702
Okay, I thought for my second book,

01:18.736 --> 01:22.198
I could move away from the
topic of sex altogether.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.064
Better to not be pigeonholed, right?

01:24.074 --> 01:26.376
Well, no one's trying to pigeonhole you.

01:26.410 --> 01:28.749
I am trying to brand you.

01:28.898 --> 01:32.815
You're a sex therapist, Karen.
Get onboard that party train.

01:32.825 --> 01:34.317
Whoot-whoot!

01:34.351 --> 01:38.088
I want 10 new proposals
next week. Can do?

01:38.630 --> 01:40.724
- Can do.
- Fantasmic.

01:40.758 --> 01:43.359
In the meantime, I got you
a spot on "LoveChat."

01:43.394 --> 01:46.029
Huge podcast. The host, Jason Hughes,

01:46.063 --> 01:49.138
is about to be bigger than Marc Maron.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.539
- You don't know who Marc Maron is?
- Honestly,

01:52.549 --> 01:55.035
I'm not sure I know what a podcast is.

01:56.639 --> 01:59.359
I'm kidding! I know what they are.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.377
Just haven't figured out
how to listen to them.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.446
Well, figure it out.

02:03.481 --> 02:05.515
You're gonna want to be
prepped before going in.

02:05.549 --> 02:08.283
Jason Hughes is a client of mine
and a bit of a shock jock,

02:08.318 --> 02:10.889
so you got to know how to
roll with the punches.

02:10.899 --> 02:12.889
I can roll.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.394
- I-I won't do that again.
- Yeah, I-I think that would be best.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.130
Uh, wine, wine.

02:22.258 --> 02:25.368
Now, I don't recommend you
trying the flower right away,

02:25.402 --> 02:28.309
but once you get used to the machine,
I can teach you how to make a heart.

02:28.319 --> 02:30.355
It's absolutely gorgeous.

02:30.365 --> 02:32.575
Honestly, Randy, you're an artist.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.810
Why, thank you.

02:33.844 --> 02:36.412
It tastes even better than it looks.

02:38.863 --> 02:41.236
Mmm. Delicious.

02:41.676 --> 02:43.353
How do you do it?

02:45.438 --> 02:47.390
So, that was a rhetorical question?

02:47.424 --> 02:50.827
So, I've decided I don't see the
point in telling Marc about the kiss.

02:50.861 --> 02:52.295
What good will it do?

02:52.305 --> 02:55.398
Well, it's not so much about doing
good as it is about preventing a bad.

02:55.432 --> 02:57.211
If you don't tell him,
he's gonna find out.

02:57.221 --> 02:59.942
I'm with Joss. Honesty is
always the best policy.

02:59.952 --> 03:01.275
Do you even know
what we're talking about?

03:01.285 --> 03:02.639
Not yet, but I'll catch up.

03:02.673 --> 03:04.260
Well, I agree with April.

03:04.270 --> 03:07.691
There's no reason to tell Marc
if it's only gonna upset him,

03:07.701 --> 03:10.638
especially if it's not something
that will ever happen again.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.115
Do you think it will ever happen again?

03:12.149 --> 03:13.447
Absolutely not.

03:13.457 --> 03:15.699
Because it shouldn't or
because you don't want it to?

03:15.709 --> 03:17.420
- Both.
- Then forget about it.

03:17.454 --> 03:19.422
Why start trouble where there is none?

03:19.456 --> 03:21.191
Mm. She makes a good point.

03:21.225 --> 03:23.793
Wha... I thought you just said
honesty was the best policy.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.583
A glib idiom that glosses
over the complexities

03:26.593 --> 03:28.651
of the human experience.

03:31.772 --> 03:34.331
- Did she just call me an idiot?
- "Idiom."

03:34.341 --> 03:36.848
An expression that cannot be understood

03:36.858 --> 03:38.663
from the meanings of its separate words

03:38.673 --> 03:40.671
but that has a separate
meaning of its own.

03:40.681 --> 03:42.779
Although in this particular case,

03:42.813 --> 03:46.349
the meaning isn't really obscured, so...

03:46.383 --> 03:48.151
What the hell is she talking about?

03:48.185 --> 03:50.486
I have no idea. Karen. Earth to Karen.

03:50.521 --> 03:53.105
Hi there. Welcome back.
Where'd you go, pretty lady?

03:53.115 --> 03:55.507
Oh, I'm just working out
some talking points

03:55.517 --> 03:57.813
for this podcast I'm gonna be on.

03:57.823 --> 03:58.997
Love-something.

03:59.007 --> 04:00.652
- No. "LoveChat"?
- Yes.

04:00.662 --> 04:03.233
Barbara got you on "LoveChat"?
That's fantastic.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.467
- Is it?
- Yeah.

04:04.501 --> 04:05.952
Well, it will be if you don't do

04:05.962 --> 04:08.638
any of that weird stuff you just did.

04:08.672 --> 04:10.111
- Speak intelligently?
- No, you just...

04:10.121 --> 04:11.545
You can't go in there over prepared,

04:11.555 --> 04:13.066
especially not with a guy
like Jason Hughes.

04:13.076 --> 04:16.278
- He's super off the cuff.
- You know who Jason Hughes is?

04:16.288 --> 04:17.560
Of course I do. I'm a publicist.

04:17.571 --> 04:19.241
It's my job to know
every minor celebrity

04:19.250 --> 04:20.572
who thinks they're a major celebrity

04:20.582 --> 04:23.493
in case, you know, one day they
actually become a major celebrity.

04:23.503 --> 04:26.614
You remember when Leonardo
DiCaprio was on "Growing Pains"?

04:26.624 --> 04:27.824
- No.
- No.

04:27.858 --> 04:29.993
- Mnh-mnh.
- Well, I do, and I was 6.

04:30.027 --> 04:31.661
Leonardo DiCaprio.

04:31.695 --> 04:33.429
- He's a beaut, isn't he?
- Mm.

04:33.464 --> 04:34.931
And single again.

04:34.965 --> 04:37.233
Anyone know where I might
be able to meet him?

Harry: This place is phenomenal.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.110
I can't belive we've
never been here before.

04:47.144 --> 04:49.279
Josslyn: Oh, well, you have to
be invited to join, right?

04:49.313 --> 04:51.514
Yeah, but I can get you in if you want.

04:51.548 --> 04:53.883
Mnh-mnh-mnh. No, I wasn't saying that.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.585
Please. He loves it.

04:56.110 --> 04:57.587
Oh.

04:57.621 --> 04:59.622
Oh, how's the new house?

04:59.657 --> 05:00.946
Are you all settled in?

05:00.956 --> 05:03.359
Yeah, pretty much. The place is great.

05:03.394 --> 05:05.280
- Traffic is a bloody nightmare.
- Oh, okay.

05:05.290 --> 05:06.577
You're up in the hills, right?

05:06.587 --> 05:08.175
Yes, there's one way in,
there's one way out,

05:08.185 --> 05:09.366
but look, I'm not complaining.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.467
I'm complaining, but I'm
a bit of a curmudgeon.

05:11.502 --> 05:13.569
- A bit? A bit?
- Okay.

05:14.672 --> 05:17.540
So, Josslyn, when are you
coming down to the site?

05:17.574 --> 05:19.238
Oh, I'm dying to see it.

05:19.248 --> 05:20.787
When do you think the opening might be?

05:20.797 --> 05:23.884
At least six months,
probably closer to a year.

05:23.894 --> 05:26.191
Oh. Are you guys doing anything now

05:26.201 --> 05:28.151
to capitalize on Harry's TV momentum?

05:28.185 --> 05:29.786
I'm just... it seems like
a wasted opportunity,

05:29.820 --> 05:30.954
if you don't mind me saying.

05:30.988 --> 05:32.789
Spoken like a true publicist.

05:32.823 --> 05:34.753
- Well, one of the best.
- Okay.

05:34.763 --> 05:36.328
You know what, we don't
have to talk shop tonight.

05:36.338 --> 05:37.827
- Let's just...
- She makes a good point.

05:37.861 --> 05:39.651
Eight months from now,
they probably won't be

05:39.661 --> 05:41.798
running as many ads with
Harry's face all over it.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.067
Thank you. That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

05:44.101 --> 05:45.768
I think it would be really worthwhile

05:45.803 --> 05:48.338
to build in some publicity
opportunities while he's hot.

05:48.372 --> 05:50.060
Yeah, but I was told it's better

05:50.070 --> 05:52.909
to do a media blitz
right before the opening.

05:52.943 --> 05:54.277
Right, that makes sense.

05:54.311 --> 05:56.320
Yeah, that's one way to go, you know.

05:56.330 --> 05:57.380
Save your money till it counts,

05:57.414 --> 05:58.830
but there's a whole other
school of thought

05:58.840 --> 06:00.092
that if you start the momentum early,

06:00.102 --> 06:02.585
as long as you keep it steady,
it can be just as effective.

06:02.619 --> 06:04.620
It might cost a little
more in the aggregate.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.356
- Money is not an issue.
- That's what I figured.

06:06.390 --> 06:08.166
What else did you have in mind?

06:08.176 --> 06:10.994
Well, a website should be up
and running immediately.

06:11.028 --> 06:12.695
You know, build that right away.

06:12.730 --> 06:14.464
We can link it into his show's website,

06:14.498 --> 06:17.798
and then boom, we have an
instant fan base, ultimately.

06:18.150 --> 06:19.932
Thanks for meeting me here
last minute like this.

06:19.942 --> 06:21.504
Of course. No problem.

06:21.538 --> 06:23.506
I know I said it was
about the subway tiles,

06:23.540 --> 06:25.341
but really, I wanted to apologize.

06:25.376 --> 06:27.010
I feel terrible about what happened.

06:27.044 --> 06:29.812
We... don't need to talk
about it. Really, it's okay.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.149
It's not okay. I'm really sorry, April.

06:33.183 --> 06:34.717
Well...

06:34.752 --> 06:36.486
I accept your apology.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.021
Thank you.

06:39.490 --> 06:41.869
- I-I was drunk.
- And upset about your divorce,

06:41.879 --> 06:43.575
which is understandable.

06:43.585 --> 06:45.628
Exactly. The timing was all wrong.

06:45.662 --> 06:47.230
Exactly!

06:47.264 --> 06:48.551
Wait, what?

06:48.561 --> 06:50.311
I never should've kissed you in reaction

06:50.321 --> 06:53.222
to what was going on with Teresa.
If I could do it over again...

06:53.232 --> 06:56.786
But you can't because I
am in a relationship...

06:58.204 --> 07:00.317
a happy relationship.

07:00.677 --> 07:02.076
Okay.

07:04.311 --> 07:06.866
I should... go.

07:08.122 --> 07:10.887
I'm sorry, April. I'm just confused.

07:10.921 --> 07:13.222
I swear I felt a connection between us.

07:13.257 --> 07:15.751
I wouldn't have kissed you otherwise.

07:15.761 --> 07:17.493
But maybe it was just me.

07:17.528 --> 07:19.662
- Was it just me?
- I am really grateful

07:19.696 --> 07:21.531
for the opportunity
you gave me, Michael,

07:21.565 --> 07:23.999
but I don't think we should
keep working together.

07:24.009 --> 07:26.509
- April...
- Good luck with everything.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

07:42.377 --> 07:44.998
Is it me, or should we be
getting naked right now?

07:45.008 --> 07:47.029
Yeah, I'm a little tired.

07:47.039 --> 07:48.577
Come here. I'll do all the work.

07:48.587 --> 07:50.693
You just lie there and you look pretty.

07:55.399 --> 07:58.401
Why did you have to do that tonight?

07:58.435 --> 07:59.602
Do what?

07:59.636 --> 08:01.293
Pitch yourself to Jonathan like that.

08:01.303 --> 08:05.007
It was so... undignified.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.605
- Excuse me?
- Tonight was supposed to be fun, Joss.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.224
Two couples getting to know each other,

08:11.234 --> 08:14.421
and instead, you turned it into
this whole strategy meeting.

08:14.431 --> 08:15.856
What are you talk... I was

08:15.866 --> 08:18.100
talking about you, Harry,
and your restaurant.

08:18.110 --> 08:20.078
And how you wanted to be the publicist.

08:20.112 --> 08:23.906
You have to admit it was
a little awkward.

08:23.916 --> 08:25.563
Yeah, actually, it was a lot awkward.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.004
Well... I was trying to be nice, but...

08:28.014 --> 08:30.028
Yeah, no, because I shouldn't
have to pitch myself, Harry.

08:30.038 --> 08:31.990
You should've offered me the job anyway,

08:32.024 --> 08:33.792
unless you think
I'm not a good publicist.

08:33.826 --> 08:36.662
I think you're a great
publicist. I just...

08:36.672 --> 08:38.672
I don't want to work together.

08:40.277 --> 08:41.732
Wow.

08:41.767 --> 08:44.533
So, you've actually... You've
actually thought this all out.

08:44.543 --> 08:46.070
I have. I even did some research,

08:46.105 --> 08:48.173
and couples who work
together fight more often.

08:48.207 --> 08:50.308
- It's statistically proven.
- Oh, my God.

08:50.342 --> 08:52.465
All right, well, okay, don't
worry about the statistics.

08:52.475 --> 08:53.987
We've worked together before, right?

08:53.997 --> 08:56.314
There was a lot of drama,
a lot of tears.

08:56.348 --> 08:58.324
Yeah, but did it ever occur to you

08:58.334 --> 09:00.185
to maybe talk this whole
thing over with me

09:00.219 --> 09:01.853
before you just made a decision?

09:01.887 --> 09:03.393
Well, I figured,
since you hadn't brought it up,

09:03.403 --> 09:05.004
that maybe we were on the same page.

09:05.014 --> 09:08.159
- Well, you were wrong.
- See this? We're fighting already.

09:14.104 --> 09:15.961
And this is the bedroom.

09:19.391 --> 09:21.234
This is where he does his podcast?

09:21.244 --> 09:23.312
Something about the acoustics.

09:23.347 --> 09:25.497
And it freaks people out.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.918
Karen Kim? Jason Hughes.
Pleasure to meet you.

09:28.952 --> 09:30.932
Thank you for having me in your... room.

09:30.942 --> 09:34.090
It's a little unorthodox,
but it keeps people on their toes.

09:34.124 --> 09:37.604
I like authenticity, which is why
I straight-up loved your book.

09:37.614 --> 09:39.395
- What a ride, man.
- Thanks. That's...

09:39.429 --> 09:42.563
Shh, shh. Save it for the show.
That's how we keep it real.

09:42.573 --> 09:44.218
Let's dive in, yeah?

09:51.654 --> 09:52.775
What's up, lovers?

09:52.809 --> 09:56.804
You're not gonna believe who I'm
sitting across from right now.

09:57.147 --> 09:58.814
Oh, she's shy. Don't be shy.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.496
- Oh, hi. I'm Karen Kim.
- Karen Kim!

10:01.506 --> 10:03.196
Author of the memoir "Unleashed."

10:03.206 --> 10:05.354
- Is memoir the right word?
- Somewhat.

10:05.389 --> 10:07.630
Well, whatever it is, it is
full-blown madness, my friends.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.425
You thought you had a decent
sex life, think again,

10:09.459 --> 10:12.025
because Ms. Kim is here to make
you feel like a damn virgin.

10:12.035 --> 10:13.661
And I don't care how
many sluts you banged.

10:13.671 --> 10:16.596
Yeah, I'm talking to you, Sheila.

10:17.734 --> 10:19.168
How fun is she?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.017
Okay, Karen Kim,
my first question is this.

10:21.027 --> 10:22.697
When you sat down to write this epic,

10:22.707 --> 10:25.508
was the intention to set back
the women's movement 100 years,

10:25.542 --> 10:28.128
or was that just a happy coincidence?

10:28.383 --> 10:30.477
- Excuse me?
- You must have realized that in success,

10:30.487 --> 10:32.948
you were basically creating
a zombie tribe of whores

10:32.983 --> 10:35.949
who will spread their legs for any Tom,
Dick, and hooker-loving Harry.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.233
Not that I don't appreciate you
keeping the bar low.

10:38.243 --> 10:39.506
- I don't think...
- But you're one of those

10:39.516 --> 10:42.124
edumacated lady folks with
all kinds of fancy degrees,

10:42.159 --> 10:43.492
so I just assumed you wouldn't bother

10:43.527 --> 10:46.395
promoting that tired cliché
that women can have it all.

10:46.430 --> 10:48.731
Orgasms and babies and power, oh, my!

10:48.765 --> 10:51.367
Because we all know that when
you try to have everything,

10:51.401 --> 10:53.822
you wind up with nothing, am I right?

10:54.121 --> 10:55.193
Well, glad we agree.

10:55.203 --> 10:56.365
Now, let's get back to your mission

10:56.375 --> 10:58.283
to reduce women to their pinker parts.

10:58.293 --> 11:00.765
So, what is your favorite
sexual position?

11:05.155 --> 11:06.615
How was drop off?

11:06.625 --> 11:08.818
You know that kid from Lucy's Instagram

11:08.852 --> 11:12.456
- who's definitely not her boyfriend?
- No.

11:12.466 --> 11:15.558
Pretty sure they were holding hands
when they walked into school.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.825
I thought I was the only one

11:16.835 --> 11:18.426
freaking out over Lucy's
little love life.

11:18.436 --> 11:19.995
I'm not freaking out, I'm jealous.

11:20.030 --> 11:22.978
The kid's getting more action
than I am these days.

11:22.988 --> 11:25.524
Although I feel like we might be able

11:25.534 --> 11:28.215
to rectify that situation.

11:28.225 --> 11:30.106
Say, now-ish?

11:30.140 --> 11:32.174
It's 8:30 in the morning.

11:32.209 --> 11:34.343
Yeah, and the house is empty.

11:34.377 --> 11:37.246
Dishes are all done. Sofa's well lit.

11:38.482 --> 11:39.882
Mm.

11:40.356 --> 11:43.085
I got fired yesterday.

11:43.496 --> 11:45.087
You what? You mean Michael?

11:45.524 --> 11:46.702
Yeah.

11:46.712 --> 11:48.190
What happened?
I thought it was going so well.

11:48.225 --> 11:49.391
Well, it was.

11:49.426 --> 11:52.294
But it was also turning into
this full-time thing, you know?

11:52.329 --> 11:54.396
He wanted me to be on-call 24/7,

11:54.431 --> 11:57.299
and that's just never
gonna fit my lifestyle.

11:57.334 --> 11:59.401
Our lifestyle.

11:59.436 --> 12:02.049
Like the other night,
Michael wanted me to stay later

12:02.059 --> 12:04.498
to go over all these rug options,

12:04.508 --> 12:06.662
but I was not about to miss
your first real gig,

12:06.672 --> 12:08.644
so I told him I couldn't, you know, go,

12:08.678 --> 12:10.546
and it turned into an argument.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.086
Yeah, see, now I feel this is my fault.

12:12.096 --> 12:14.743
It's not. It is 100% not your fault.

12:14.753 --> 12:17.164
It was my choice.

12:17.174 --> 12:19.224
I thought you said you got fired.

12:19.330 --> 12:23.392
That's right.
It was my choice to get fired.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.471
But you loved it so much.

12:26.752 --> 12:28.360
It's okay.

12:28.632 --> 12:30.480
I love you more.

12:33.770 --> 12:35.137
- Mmm, yum.
- Oi!

12:35.172 --> 12:36.906
- Ow!
- Sit, eat.

12:36.940 --> 12:39.308
Sorry, dove. Can't be
lollygagging about anymore.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.277
I'm a working woman.

12:41.311 --> 12:45.511
Just waiting for Harrison Ford to buy
me a lunch box and kiss me goodbye.

12:48.371 --> 12:50.486
This is why I wanted a sister.

12:54.014 --> 12:55.658
Hi.

12:57.134 --> 12:58.794
Okay, let me just start by saying

12:58.829 --> 13:00.462
that I understand why you
think it's a bad idea

13:00.497 --> 13:02.198
for the two of us
to be working together,

13:02.232 --> 13:04.500
but if you just hear me out
and you still feel the same way,

13:04.534 --> 13:06.298
I will never bring it up again.

13:06.308 --> 13:07.821
I'm listening.

13:07.831 --> 13:09.308
Okay.

13:11.074 --> 13:12.708
Number one... While you were correct

13:12.742 --> 13:14.558
that during our previous
working relationship,

13:14.568 --> 13:15.904
there was a lot of fighting,

13:15.914 --> 13:17.374
I would argue that most of that fighting

13:17.384 --> 13:20.761
was a result of the sexual
tension building up between us.

13:20.771 --> 13:22.852
Now that we're a couple,
we can have sex whenever we want.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.820
No more tension.

13:24.926 --> 13:27.823
- It's an interesting point.
- Mm! Okay.

13:27.858 --> 13:31.293
Number two... Events by Josslyn
was my first venture on my own.

13:31.328 --> 13:32.661
I was... I was young, I was naive,

13:32.696 --> 13:34.296
and I had no clue what I was doing.

13:34.331 --> 13:35.531
I've grown up a lot since then.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.343
I agree.

13:37.659 --> 13:38.946
You do?

13:39.157 --> 13:40.469
Great.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.572
Oh, right. Um... wait.

13:43.607 --> 13:46.175
Number three... unlike the last
time we worked together,

13:46.209 --> 13:47.830
this wouldn't be a partnership.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.923
Okay? I'd be working for you,

13:49.933 --> 13:52.047
and as my client,
I would always defer to you,

13:52.082 --> 13:53.515
unlike in our marriage
where I'll most likely

13:53.550 --> 13:55.212
always demand the last word.

13:55.713 --> 13:57.887
Can't argue with that. You win.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.555
No, Harry, I don't want to win, okay?

13:59.589 --> 14:02.327
- I want you to want me.
- I want you.

14:02.337 --> 14:04.593
I want you and so does Jonathan.

14:04.628 --> 14:06.816
I talked it over with him after
you went to bed last night,

14:06.826 --> 14:09.124
and he agreed we should hire you.

14:09.134 --> 14:10.532
Har...

14:10.567 --> 14:13.068
Okay, if you keep making
decisions about me without me

14:13.103 --> 14:15.437
we're gonna have a problem,
but not this decision.

14:15.472 --> 14:18.306
This is a great decision. Yay!

14:20.477 --> 14:23.012
- Should we celebrate?
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.314 --> 14:39.395
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah, you Michael?

14:39.429 --> 14:42.788
- Who's asking?
- I'm Marc, April's boyfriend.

14:44.267 --> 14:45.588
Is April with you?

14:45.598 --> 14:47.462
Oh, no, no, no. She doesn't
even know that I'm here,

14:47.472 --> 14:49.538
and I'd prefer to keep it
that way if you don't mind.

14:49.572 --> 14:51.413
- Of course.
- Um...

14:51.423 --> 14:54.276
thing is, I feel somewhat responsible

14:54.311 --> 14:56.045
for what happened with you guys.

14:56.079 --> 14:58.361
It's nobody's fault. We
shouldn't be placing blame here.

14:58.371 --> 14:59.796
Yeah, but now April's really upset,

14:59.806 --> 15:01.705
which makes me really upset,

15:01.715 --> 15:03.271
and I just know that if you
give her a second chance,

15:03.281 --> 15:04.753
- Of course.
- I feel horrible about all this.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.883
I never should've kissed her.

15:07.217 --> 15:08.791
Wait, what?

15:10.462 --> 15:12.127
You...

15:12.162 --> 15:13.499
you kissed April?

15:13.509 --> 15:16.609
I thought that's why you
came all the way out here.

15:30.301 --> 15:31.674
April: Hey.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.240
I was just about to start dinner.

15:34.274 --> 15:37.376
- Lucy's finishing her homework.
- And you kissed Michael.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.787
- Marc.
- Yeah.

15:42.797 --> 15:46.419
Okay, first of all,
I did not kiss him. He kissed me.

15:46.453 --> 15:47.817
Come on, April.
If we're gonna play games...

15:47.827 --> 15:49.483
No, we're not.

15:49.659 --> 15:51.957
I-I just wanted to, um...

15:52.388 --> 15:53.775
make sure that you had all the facts

15:53.785 --> 15:55.227
before we had this conversation.

15:55.262 --> 15:57.391
Why are we having this conversation now?

15:57.584 --> 15:58.640
Why didn't you tell me when it happened?

15:58.650 --> 16:01.481
I'm so sorry. Honestly,
I did think about it,

16:01.491 --> 16:05.369
but then I decided that it was
so stupid and meaningless,

16:05.379 --> 16:08.970
and I didn't want you to get
all upset for no reason.

16:09.727 --> 16:11.678
How did you even find out?

16:11.854 --> 16:16.200
I-I went over to his house to
try to get you your job back.

16:16.457 --> 16:18.485
Wound up punching the guy in the face.

16:18.688 --> 16:21.161
Wait. You punched him in the face?

16:21.195 --> 16:22.829
Yeah, you're damn right I did.

16:22.863 --> 16:24.964
Why did you have to go and do
a stupid thing like that?

16:24.999 --> 16:26.332
Oh, I did the stupid thing?

16:26.367 --> 16:28.635
I just told you that kiss
meant nothing to me.

16:28.669 --> 16:31.792
I quit a job that I loved
because you were more important,

16:31.802 --> 16:33.039
but that does not give you the right

16:33.073 --> 16:36.042
to just go and act like a damn fool.

16:36.076 --> 16:38.778
This is exactly what
happened with Richard.

16:39.364 --> 16:40.701
Who the hell is Richard?

16:40.711 --> 16:42.482
My ex-boyfriend who went
and beat up Paul

16:42.516 --> 16:43.983
after he died the first time,

16:43.993 --> 16:46.152
and that was the beginning of
the end of our relationship.

16:46.187 --> 16:48.455
- You and Paul?
- Me and Richard!

16:48.489 --> 16:50.156
I don't go for that macho crap,

16:50.191 --> 16:53.459
which is one of the reasons
I fell in love with you.

16:53.811 --> 16:55.462
I thought you were better than that,

16:55.496 --> 16:57.797
but now I don't know what to think.

16:57.832 --> 16:59.732
What is happening here?

16:59.767 --> 17:01.501
Hey, you're the one who
kissed someone else!

17:01.535 --> 17:04.065
I'm the one who gets to walk away mad!

17:04.698 --> 17:06.673
I'm walking!

17:12.680 --> 17:13.713
Morning, Lila.

17:13.747 --> 17:15.548
Good morning, Dr. Kim.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.794
I meant to text you last night

17:16.804 --> 17:18.712
to tell you how much
I loved your podcast.

17:18.722 --> 17:20.252
You were fantastic.

17:20.287 --> 17:21.753
No, I wasn't.

17:21.789 --> 17:23.857
Well, you didn't say as
much as I was expecting,

17:23.891 --> 17:25.925
but the podcast itself was riveting.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.671
That Jason Hughes, what a hoot, right?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.430
And sexy, too.

17:30.464 --> 17:33.628
He is much more attractive in
person than I thought he'd be.

17:33.638 --> 17:36.069
- When did you meet him?
- He's waiting for you in your office.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.749
Did I not mention that?

17:46.569 --> 17:47.861
Adorable.

17:47.871 --> 17:49.282
She's got your chin.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.676
What are you doing here?

17:51.686 --> 17:54.746
I came to say thank you
for the awesome interview.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.248
You left in such a hurry,
I didn't get my hug.

17:57.258 --> 17:58.630
That wasn't an interview.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.102
It was a monologue,
an insulting one at that.

18:01.112 --> 18:03.309
You can't take it so personally.
It's all part of the act.

18:03.319 --> 18:06.121
It may be part of your act,
but I don't have an act.

18:06.155 --> 18:07.989
Well, if that's the case,
then you better get one.

18:08.023 --> 18:10.158
Because the second you
become a public figure,

18:10.192 --> 18:11.750
you need to cultivate a persona,

18:11.760 --> 18:13.895
if for no other reason
than to keep yourself sane.

18:13.929 --> 18:16.431
I'm pretty sure having
two competing personalities

18:16.465 --> 18:19.134
is the definition of insane,
but what do I know?

18:19.168 --> 18:22.157
I'm just a licensed psychiatrist.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.773
- Come back on my show.
- No, thank you.

18:24.807 --> 18:25.974
You've got more downloads already

18:26.008 --> 18:27.776
than the hot robot from "Ex Machina."

18:27.810 --> 18:30.086
I really don't care.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.950
I get it. You're afraid.

18:36.242 --> 18:37.281
Please.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.487
You don't want to be challenged
on your bogus theories.

18:39.522 --> 18:41.189
If you were really confident in them,

18:41.223 --> 18:43.508
you'd leap at the chance
to stand up for them.

18:43.518 --> 18:44.859
The fact that you're blowing me off

18:44.894 --> 18:47.262
must mean that you don't buy
into this pseudo-feminist crap

18:47.296 --> 18:48.396
any more than I do.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.132
Are you really attempting
reverse psychology on me?

18:51.167 --> 18:53.601
No, I'm honestly relieved.
But friend to friend...

18:53.636 --> 18:55.698
- We're not friends.
- As long as you keep hiding

18:55.708 --> 18:57.205
behind this progressive nonsense,

18:57.239 --> 18:59.207
you'll never get what you
really want out of life.

18:59.241 --> 19:01.985
And what do I really want
out of life, Jason?

19:01.995 --> 19:03.778
What every woman wants.

19:03.813 --> 19:06.214
A husband, security,

19:06.248 --> 19:09.948
someone who can give you another
child before your eggs dry up.

19:11.940 --> 19:14.640
You have 10 seconds
before I call security.

19:19.580 --> 19:21.520
Call me if you change your mind.

19:26.936 --> 19:28.736
Okay, let's start with the basics.

19:28.771 --> 19:31.573
When did you first know that you
wanted to become a chef?

19:31.607 --> 19:33.041
You know the answer to that.

19:33.075 --> 19:34.819
- Pretend I forgot.
- Did you forget?

19:34.829 --> 19:36.644
No, of course not.

19:36.679 --> 19:38.646
Um, okay, let's start
with a different question.

19:38.681 --> 19:41.160
- Your previous restaurant...
- Savannah's Kitchen.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.894
No, I was talking about Wunderbar.

19:42.904 --> 19:45.153
Mm, yeah, that wasn't mine.
That was Greta's.

19:45.187 --> 19:47.722
I guess so, but if we bring up
Savannah's Kitchen,

19:47.756 --> 19:50.560
we kind of have to talk about Savi.

19:50.570 --> 19:52.160
Which leads to me being divorced.

19:52.194 --> 19:54.562
Yes, and engaged to her sister.

19:54.597 --> 19:56.531
Which is unappealing.

19:56.565 --> 19:58.600
In a court of public opinion, yes.

19:58.634 --> 20:01.269
See, Harry, the idea here is to
write a jazzy little puff piece

20:01.303 --> 20:02.837
that I can put on your show's website,

20:02.872 --> 20:05.787
and I can link it to the
restaurant site in progress.

20:05.797 --> 20:08.209
- We have a site in progress?
- You do now.

20:08.244 --> 20:11.112
- You are good at your job.
- Why, thank you. I know.

20:11.146 --> 20:13.181
Okay, let's try something different.

20:13.215 --> 20:15.250
Uh... Oh!

20:15.284 --> 20:16.851
Here we go.

20:16.886 --> 20:19.759
What was your all-time
most memorable dish?

20:21.891 --> 20:23.291
Spaghetti and ketchup.

20:23.325 --> 20:25.050
- Harry.
- I'm serious.

20:25.060 --> 20:29.097
I was 7 years old and I loved
my mum's Sunday night pasta.

20:29.131 --> 20:31.266
But I had no idea
how she made it, right?

20:31.300 --> 20:34.954
And then one day she was working
late and I was starving,

20:35.244 --> 20:37.405
so I decided I could probably
figure out how she did it

20:37.439 --> 20:39.140
by just looking in the fridge,

20:39.174 --> 20:40.624
which wasn't terribly well stocked,

20:40.634 --> 20:44.112
but I knew the sauce was red,
so I had a little snoop around.

20:44.146 --> 20:46.247
And other than a few
rancid strawberries,

20:46.282 --> 20:49.884
there wasn't anything red
except for... the ketchup.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.553
So I boiled the water,
stuck in the pasta...

20:51.587 --> 20:53.221
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You were 7?

20:53.255 --> 20:55.423
7 years old. Plucked the
pasta out with a fork

20:55.457 --> 20:57.992
'cause I had no idea what
a colander was at the time.

20:58.027 --> 20:59.827
And I poured half a bottle of ketchup

20:59.862 --> 21:02.230
all over it and mixed it up.

21:02.264 --> 21:04.799
- Voilà. Dinner.
- And it was delicious.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.049
- It was horrible.
- Oh.

21:06.059 --> 21:07.874
But you didn't ask me
what my best dish was,

21:07.884 --> 21:10.171
you asked me what my
most memorable dish was,

21:10.205 --> 21:14.108
and like any good man,
you never forget your first.

21:17.130 --> 21:18.479
I love that story.

21:18.514 --> 21:21.182
- I love you.
- I love...

21:22.576 --> 21:24.252
Um, Justin.

21:24.286 --> 21:28.076
Can you please take
a very long lunch right now?

21:29.730 --> 21:32.327
Oh, what's... okay. Wow.

21:32.361 --> 21:33.595
Mm.

21:33.629 --> 21:35.296
This is the best interview ever.

21:35.331 --> 21:37.365
Mm. So, so good.

21:37.399 --> 21:38.656
Mm.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.242
What the heck is that?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.416
- Oops.
- Kate?

22:08.382 --> 22:09.697
Oh, my God.

22:09.732 --> 22:11.232
It's not that bad.

22:11.266 --> 22:13.234
I can't believe he did that
to you, Michael.

22:13.268 --> 22:14.469
I'm so sorry.

22:14.503 --> 22:16.270
Honestly, it's okay.

22:21.210 --> 22:22.744
I am so embarrassed.

22:22.778 --> 22:24.045
Please don't be.

22:24.079 --> 22:25.955
Really, he was well within his rights,

22:25.965 --> 22:28.883
and truth be told, it wasn't
entirely unpleasant.

22:28.917 --> 22:30.518
- Getting punched in the face?
- Yeah.

22:32.202 --> 22:33.588
I don't understand.

22:33.622 --> 22:36.557
I know you don't, April,
and that's my fault.

22:36.592 --> 22:38.393
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

22:38.427 --> 22:40.094
What do you mean? What's going on?

22:40.129 --> 22:42.330
It's not like I've been keeping
a secret. It's different.

22:42.364 --> 22:45.166
Honestly, Michael, whatever
it is, I can handle it.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.202
I've had a husband die twice
and fell in love with a painter

22:48.237 --> 22:50.071
who turned out to be an FBI agent.

22:50.105 --> 22:52.720
It takes a lot to surprise me.

22:53.213 --> 22:55.034
I'm transgender.

23:02.664 --> 23:03.727
I wish I could say it's something

23:03.762 --> 23:07.204
I always knew about myself,
but it took some time.

23:07.404 --> 23:08.871
When I was a kid, my mom used to call me

23:08.906 --> 23:10.340
her little tomboy because of how

23:10.374 --> 23:12.604
I liked to dress and wear my hair short.

23:12.614 --> 23:14.647
As I got older, I started meeting

23:14.657 --> 23:17.066
people who identified as trans,

23:17.076 --> 23:19.583
and that's when I realized...

23:19.777 --> 23:21.211
that's who I am.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.308
How... old were you?

23:25.318 --> 23:26.719
26.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.120
I had just met Teresa.

23:28.154 --> 23:29.955
I knew she was special,

23:29.990 --> 23:31.790
but I also knew that it was important

23:31.825 --> 23:33.225
to her that she was a lesbian.

23:33.259 --> 23:35.327
I know that might sound strange.

23:35.362 --> 23:38.964
I mean, none of this
sounds easy for anyone.

23:38.999 --> 23:42.001
So, me telling her
that I wanted to transition,

23:42.035 --> 23:44.003
I knew it could be an issue.

23:44.037 --> 23:46.639
So I didn't say anything
for a long time.

23:46.673 --> 23:50.042
Not until I knew that she loved me.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.613
You didn't want to lose her.

23:52.623 --> 23:54.380
I can understand why you waited.

23:54.414 --> 23:56.454
I honestly thought that our relationship

23:56.464 --> 23:58.706
might be enough for me to be happy,

23:58.716 --> 24:02.221
but as time went on, I needed more.

24:02.255 --> 24:04.751
I needed to live fully as myself.

24:05.103 --> 24:07.002
She understood at first,

24:07.012 --> 24:10.396
but after a while, I think
it just was too much for her.

24:10.430 --> 24:13.080
Why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

24:14.351 --> 24:16.735
Selfishly...

24:16.770 --> 24:21.173
I think I was enjoying my first
authentic relationship as a man.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.442
Do you hate me?

24:23.857 --> 24:25.944
Of course not.

24:25.979 --> 24:28.781
I hope I haven't ruined anything
between you and Marc.

24:28.815 --> 24:32.051
Don't worry about Marc.
I'm just glad you told me.

24:32.085 --> 24:35.087
Me too. Me too.

24:45.177 --> 24:47.077
I'm sorry you had to see that.

24:47.087 --> 24:49.338
I've seen it before. I have Showtime.

24:49.348 --> 24:51.603
I'd really appreciate
if you didn't tell April.

24:51.638 --> 24:53.175
It's not like it's a regular thing.

24:53.185 --> 24:54.807
That you had sex in the storage room

24:54.841 --> 24:56.475
or that you had sex with a married man?

24:56.509 --> 24:58.143
How did you know he was married?

24:58.178 --> 25:00.379
He came into the store the
other day with his husband.

25:00.413 --> 25:03.115
- Oh.
- Yeah. "Oh."

25:03.281 --> 25:05.384
Are you angry at me or something?

25:05.418 --> 25:07.152
I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.

25:07.187 --> 25:08.725
I hate cheating.

25:08.735 --> 25:10.322
It's what ruined my
relationship with Brian.

25:10.356 --> 25:11.543
It's what ruins all relationships.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.960
Well, I hope it ruins theirs

25:12.970 --> 25:16.109
because I really love Gary
and I think he loves me.

25:16.119 --> 25:18.423
Doesn't make it right. They took vows!

25:18.433 --> 25:20.122
People make mistakes.

25:20.156 --> 25:22.268
That's why God invented divorce.

25:22.278 --> 25:24.927
It's easy to fall in love when
you have zero restrictions.

25:24.961 --> 25:27.630
Just last week, I met the most
gorgeous man I've ever seen

25:27.664 --> 25:29.398
in my entire life at a taco truck.

25:29.432 --> 25:31.967
But as soon as he mentioned
his wife, I walked away,

25:32.002 --> 25:34.103
even after he told me he was separated.

25:34.137 --> 25:37.806
It didn't matter, because
I have standards and morals.

25:37.841 --> 25:40.262
You keep acting all judgy judgy,

25:40.272 --> 25:43.391
and those girls are never gonna
let you in their clique.

25:44.139 --> 25:46.399
- I don't care.
- Mm-hmm.

25:46.409 --> 25:47.750
Yeah, you do.

25:52.199 --> 25:53.956
How's it going as Harry's publicist?

25:53.990 --> 25:55.457
Mm, great.

25:55.492 --> 25:56.959
I think it's actually gonna be good

25:56.993 --> 25:58.331
for our relationship, you know?

25:58.341 --> 26:00.617
I'm learning all these
really cute things about him.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.131
It's fun.

26:02.165 --> 26:03.666
More importantly,

26:03.700 --> 26:06.068
how badly did you suck on that podcast?

26:06.102 --> 26:09.471
You're really sticking with this
honesty is the best policy thing, huh?

26:09.506 --> 26:11.173
No, I... Don't feel too bad, honey.

26:11.207 --> 26:14.076
- It wasn't entirely your fault.
- It wasn't my fault at all.

26:14.110 --> 26:15.918
He is a pompous blowhard

26:15.928 --> 26:18.013
who didn't let me
get a word in edgewise.

26:18.048 --> 26:21.483
And he had the audacity to ask me to
come back, if you can believe it.

26:21.518 --> 26:24.453
- He did? That's great.
- Did you not hear what I just said?

26:24.487 --> 26:26.255
Karen, he's giving you
an opportunity to...

26:26.289 --> 26:27.823
To embarrass myself again?

26:27.857 --> 26:29.992
No, thanks. Fool me once, shame on you.

26:30.026 --> 26:31.994
- Fool me twice...
- You're a moron.

26:32.028 --> 26:34.930
That's not exactly how it goes,
but close enough.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.533
Yeah, no, no, no. You're not...
You're not looking at the big picture.

26:37.567 --> 26:40.035
This is exactly what Jackie and I
were talking about the other day.

26:40.070 --> 26:42.137
- Who's Jackie again?
- Oh, my trainer.

26:42.172 --> 26:43.772
She's, uh... You would love her.

26:43.807 --> 26:46.308
She's... she's all about,
you know, female empowerment

26:46.343 --> 26:48.929
and taking what's ours,
and she thinks that half the time,

26:48.939 --> 26:51.313
we let men win simply by
refusing to play the game.

26:51.348 --> 26:53.816
Just like what almost happened
with Harry when he first told me

26:53.850 --> 26:55.281
that he didn't want me
to be his publicist.

26:55.291 --> 26:57.319
But then I re-engaged,
and look what happened.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.154
That's because Harry isn't a jerk.

26:59.189 --> 27:00.723
Jason Hughes, on the other hand...

27:00.757 --> 27:02.664
Is a pompous blowhard,
but we know this, okay?

27:02.674 --> 27:04.645
So let's be strategic.
The next time you go in there,

27:04.655 --> 27:06.098
you don't wait to be given the floor.

27:06.108 --> 27:08.297
You... You take the floor.
You demand to be heard.

27:08.331 --> 27:10.332
You lean in, Karen.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.436
- You're getting better at this.
- Come on.

27:16.949 --> 27:18.307
Hey, wait up.

27:25.849 --> 27:29.151
Hey! You checking up on me?

27:29.185 --> 27:33.222
Actually, probably smart since I
can't remember where I put my key.

27:35.503 --> 27:36.813
You okay?

27:36.963 --> 27:38.193
Mm.

27:38.228 --> 27:39.902
I know I'm new to the group,

27:39.912 --> 27:42.731
but I'm a really good listener.

27:42.766 --> 27:44.757
Back home, I had my own lady posse.

27:44.767 --> 27:47.529
Granted, it was my mom
and my cousin Sally, but...

27:47.539 --> 27:49.405
Michael was a girl.

27:50.639 --> 27:53.275
- Excuse me?
- Michael, the guy who kissed me?

27:53.590 --> 27:55.798
He used to be a girl.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.280
- Wow.
- Yeah.

27:58.954 --> 28:00.582
What was her name?

28:01.329 --> 28:03.185
I don't know. I didn't ask.

28:03.219 --> 28:05.954
Did he have the surgery and everything?

28:05.989 --> 28:08.168
I didn't ask that either. Should I have?

28:08.178 --> 28:09.656
I-I have no idea. I mean, I'm...

28:09.690 --> 28:11.991
I'm really out of my depth on this one.

28:12.026 --> 28:13.592
Me too.

28:14.428 --> 28:17.900
At least you don't have to feel
bad about the kiss anymore.

28:17.910 --> 28:19.132
Why not?

28:19.166 --> 28:22.402
Well, if on some level, you did
allow for it to happen

28:22.436 --> 28:26.005
because of some inexplicable connection,

28:26.040 --> 28:27.807
maybe there's a reason.

28:27.841 --> 28:31.678
Maybe it's because you were bonding
on some deeper female level.

28:31.712 --> 28:34.113
Like how it is when you
make a new girlfriend.

28:34.148 --> 28:36.315
Can be really intense.

28:36.711 --> 28:39.852
You know what?
That actually makes sense.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.588
Maybe it was a sisterhood thing?

28:41.622 --> 28:43.790
Sure. If that's the case,

28:43.824 --> 28:46.626
there's no reason why you can't
keep working together.

28:46.660 --> 28:49.996
It's not like anything's gonna
happen between the two of you.

28:50.030 --> 28:51.292
That's true.

28:51.302 --> 28:54.033
And if you think about it,
Michael being trans

28:54.068 --> 28:56.866
could be the best thing
that's ever happened.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.605
You know what, Kate?

28:58.639 --> 29:01.497
You're gonna fit in
just fine around here.

29:03.711 --> 29:05.311
Good morning, lovers.

29:05.346 --> 29:06.804
Back by popular demand,

29:06.814 --> 29:09.927
the one, the only,
the deliriously sexy...

29:09.937 --> 29:11.951
I'm gonna stop you right there.

29:11.986 --> 29:15.005
Uh, someone's feeling feisty.

29:15.471 --> 29:18.124
I'm not feeling anything but tired,

29:18.158 --> 29:19.963
and not just because
my daughter woke me up

29:19.973 --> 29:21.872
at 1:00, 3:00, and 5:00 a.m.

29:21.882 --> 29:24.133
I'm tired of being reduced
to my appearance.

29:24.143 --> 29:26.499
I'm tired of being taken out of context.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.497
I'm tired of being talked
over, glossed over,

29:28.507 --> 29:30.066
airbrushed, and antagonized.

29:30.076 --> 29:31.977
I'm tired of having to
listen to men like you

29:32.012 --> 29:34.814
who turn my daily struggles
into pithy punch lines.

29:34.848 --> 29:36.649
I'm not here to amuse you, Jason.

29:36.683 --> 29:38.536
I'm here to educate you.

29:38.546 --> 29:40.314
Now...

29:42.118 --> 29:43.579
what's your first question?

29:46.312 --> 29:50.015
Okay. Be honest. Do I sound like a prat?

29:50.025 --> 29:51.692
So far, you sound fantastic.

29:51.727 --> 29:54.725
And the picture Joss chose is lovely.

29:54.735 --> 29:55.895
Huh.

29:55.905 --> 29:58.290
I didn't know you worked
for Charlie Trotter.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.967
He was one of your heroes, wasn't he?

30:00.002 --> 30:01.369
I didn't work with him.

30:01.403 --> 30:03.037
I was a busboy at one of
his restaurants.

30:03.072 --> 30:04.672
Does it say that I worked with him?

30:04.706 --> 30:07.799
It's definitely the implication, especially
since she's quoting a conversation

30:07.809 --> 30:09.177
the two of you apparently had.

30:09.211 --> 30:10.845
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:10.879 --> 30:14.135
He didn't say that to me.
I said that about him.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.692
Look at this. She's gone
and twisted this all around.

30:16.702 --> 30:18.990
Consider it a happy accident, then.
You come off much more charming

30:19.000 --> 30:20.655
on the page than you are in real life.

30:20.689 --> 30:22.457
- This is just...
- Morning, beautiful people.

30:22.491 --> 30:24.826
Hey, this article you wrote
about me is a bunch of lies.

30:24.860 --> 30:27.395
Well written lies.
Let's keep this positive.

30:27.429 --> 30:29.997
I didn't make anything up.
Maybe I embellished a little.

30:30.032 --> 30:31.232
Or a lot.

30:31.266 --> 30:32.867
Harry. It's not a crime.

30:32.901 --> 30:34.902
I just took some of the best
parts of your life

30:34.937 --> 30:36.204
and I sparkled them up a bit.

30:36.238 --> 30:37.782
It's like Photoshop, but with words.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.707
Okay, I don't need you
to Photoshop my life.

30:39.741 --> 30:41.915
It is sparkly enough as it is, thanks.

30:41.925 --> 30:44.078
- Meh.
- Meh?

30:44.113 --> 30:46.314
Who wants a smoothie? Just me?

30:46.348 --> 30:48.416
Honey, obviously I think
you're fascinating,

30:48.450 --> 30:50.485
but I'm your biggest fan.
I'm not the most subjective.

30:50.519 --> 30:52.186
I had some of the girls
give it a read, and...

30:52.221 --> 30:54.922
- What... what girls?
- My crew, my people.

30:54.957 --> 30:57.391
This is what I do for a living,
okay? So just trust me.

30:57.426 --> 30:59.060
Okay, Joss, I want you to change it.

30:59.094 --> 31:00.661
Are you kidding me? Don't be crazy.

31:00.696 --> 31:03.064
I'm not being crazy. I'm the client.
You work for me, remember?

31:03.098 --> 31:05.295
Are you seriously taking that
tone with me right now?

31:05.305 --> 31:07.368
Ooh, mango. Such a treat.

31:07.402 --> 31:09.036
I'm not taking any tone, okay?

31:09.071 --> 31:11.005
I-I want you to change it.

31:13.483 --> 31:16.444
Okay, whatever you say, boss.

31:17.618 --> 31:19.347
- Mother...
- Whoa.

31:19.855 --> 31:21.015
Easy there, love.

31:21.049 --> 31:22.950
Hey, hey. You okay?

31:22.985 --> 31:24.085
No.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.465
Sorry, am I interrupting?

31:37.499 --> 31:40.101
No, I'm just messing around.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.604
I tried to, um, wait up for you
last night so we could talk,

31:43.639 --> 31:45.540
but you got home so late.

31:45.574 --> 31:47.542
Yeah, well, rehearsal went
longer than I thought.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.581
So, I, um, I went over to
Michael's house yesterday.

31:53.615 --> 31:55.917
I was planning on apologizing
on your behalf,

31:55.951 --> 31:58.819
but it turned out I didn't need to.

31:59.408 --> 32:03.124
He wasn't angry. In fact,
he was glad you did what you did.

32:03.158 --> 32:05.826
Made him feel like a real man,
or something like that.

32:05.861 --> 32:07.625
Look, I don't know what angle
you're playing here, April.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.964
Michael is transgender.

32:09.998 --> 32:13.100
He used to be a woman,
and now he's a man.

32:15.152 --> 32:16.617
Okay.

32:16.863 --> 32:18.072
Well, okay.

32:18.106 --> 32:22.009
Uh, wow, I... I don't know what to say.

32:22.044 --> 32:25.079
I know. Obviously, I had no idea.

32:25.113 --> 32:26.948
I mean, I've been working
with the guy for weeks now.

32:26.982 --> 32:28.478
You'd think you'd be able
to tell, but...

32:28.488 --> 32:30.685
I don't know. I just met the guy.

32:32.063 --> 32:34.602
This has to be a little
strange for you, I guess.

32:34.612 --> 32:38.159
Well, yeah. It's, uh...
It's been a lot to process.

32:38.664 --> 32:40.968
But, I mean, at least now I feel like

32:40.978 --> 32:43.346
I can go back and finish the job.

32:44.127 --> 32:46.500
- Really?
- Well, yeah. I mean, why wouldn't I?

32:46.535 --> 32:48.496
For all the same reasons you
weren't gonna go back before,

32:48.506 --> 32:49.670
because he kissed you.

32:49.705 --> 32:51.105
He's clearly attracted to you, April.

32:51.139 --> 32:52.707
Honestly, I think he's just confused.

32:52.741 --> 32:54.942
And even if he is attracted
to me, so what?

32:54.977 --> 32:56.355
I'm not attracted to him.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.945
It's not like anything
would ever happen.

32:57.980 --> 32:59.046
Yeah, but still...

32:59.081 --> 33:02.049
Just like nothing would ever
happen with you and Sofia.

33:02.084 --> 33:03.664
What does Sofia have to
do with any of this?

33:03.674 --> 33:06.187
I'm just saying you're working
with a very attractive woman.

33:06.221 --> 33:08.389
A woman you used to date.

33:08.423 --> 33:09.957
I could be jealous,

33:09.992 --> 33:13.027
but I choose not to be
because I trust you.

33:14.501 --> 33:17.031
The question is, do you trust me?

33:20.287 --> 33:22.036
Yeah.

33:22.624 --> 33:24.005
I do.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.175
Then kiss me.

33:35.865 --> 33:37.485
Good God.

33:37.519 --> 33:39.687
Your face looks like
the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.

33:39.721 --> 33:43.371
You'll be happy to know that Gary
broke up with me last night.

33:43.866 --> 33:45.493
I'm not happy that you're miserable,

33:45.527 --> 33:48.195
but I'm not surprised either.

33:48.230 --> 33:51.332
Karma has a mysterious
way of working out.

33:51.366 --> 33:54.201
Enjoy your soapbox now,
my little kangaroo.

33:54.236 --> 33:57.038
You've lived in this city
for about five minutes.

33:57.072 --> 33:59.173
Call me when you've been
out here for five years

33:59.207 --> 34:01.208
and tell me how easy it is to find love.

34:01.243 --> 34:03.343
- I never...
- You think you're gonna click

34:03.353 --> 34:04.900
with every guy you meet at a taco truck?

34:04.910 --> 34:06.589
You think there are a
million guys out there

34:06.599 --> 34:08.806
who are unattached,
somewhat close to your age,

34:08.815 --> 34:10.583
and check off all your boxes?

34:10.619 --> 34:12.286
Guess again.

34:12.321 --> 34:15.434
I've been single for 10 years,
and it's been hard.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.190
I am tired of being alone.

34:17.225 --> 34:19.193
I want kids, I want a family,

34:19.226 --> 34:21.116
I want everything that you want,

34:21.126 --> 34:26.100
and I thought I had finally found that.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.976
Hi, Barbara. I'm so
glad you called me in.

34:36.011 --> 34:37.978
I have so many ideas
to go over with you...

34:38.013 --> 34:39.413
Are you a bourbon or a scotch girl?

34:39.447 --> 34:40.699
I'm good, thanks.

34:40.710 --> 34:43.138
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd have any new thoughts.

34:43.148 --> 34:44.418
At least not this quickly.

34:44.453 --> 34:47.628
But my last interview with Jason
got me so pumped up.

34:47.638 --> 34:49.255
Well, that's great, Karen.

34:49.291 --> 34:50.658
But unfortunately, I'm not sure

34:50.692 --> 34:52.760
I can invest any more
time in this right now.

34:53.418 --> 34:55.510
- In what?
- You.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.107
Not right now.

34:57.117 --> 34:59.133
Are you firing me?

34:59.713 --> 35:01.271
Yes.

35:01.729 --> 35:02.899
I don't understand.

35:02.909 --> 35:05.643
Well, of course you don't,
because if you did,

35:05.653 --> 35:07.241
you wouldn't have gone
on Jason's podcast

35:07.275 --> 35:09.443
with the clear intention
of humiliating him.

35:09.478 --> 35:11.091
Humiliating him?

35:11.101 --> 35:12.480
What about what he did to me?

35:12.514 --> 35:15.008
- His show, his rules.
- I was just standing up for myself.

35:15.018 --> 35:16.250
You should be on my side.

35:16.284 --> 35:18.231
Jason has been my client
for a long time.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.788
Jason brings in more money than me.

35:19.798 --> 35:21.455
I understand that. But as a woman...

35:21.490 --> 35:24.258
As a woman, I will do
what's best for me.

35:24.292 --> 35:27.150
As an ambitious, intelligent,
business-minded woman,

35:27.160 --> 35:28.831
I will do what's best for my company.

35:28.841 --> 35:31.181
I don't let my personal
feelings get in the way.

35:31.191 --> 35:33.734
My soul will not be compromised here.

35:42.411 --> 35:45.212
In order for your soul
to be compromised,

35:45.247 --> 35:47.047
you need to have one.

35:54.647 --> 35:58.067
A friend of mine from Food & Wine
is meeting us at the site.

35:58.077 --> 36:00.278
I sent him that blurb that Joss wrote,

36:00.313 --> 36:02.447
and he thinks he can build off of it.

36:02.482 --> 36:04.349
Oh, man. I'm sorry about that.

36:04.383 --> 36:06.013
I should've called you earlier. Um...

36:06.023 --> 36:08.720
that piece... is rubbish.

36:08.754 --> 36:11.991
Joss got a little carried away, but I've
asked her to take it down, rework it.

36:12.001 --> 36:14.035
- Why?
- Because it's not true.

36:14.328 --> 36:15.870
Well, not all of it, anyway.

36:15.905 --> 36:18.506
Harry, you're not running for president.

36:18.541 --> 36:21.576
You're a celebrity chef
who has never done cocaine.

36:21.610 --> 36:23.511
It's amazing she could find something

36:23.546 --> 36:25.313
to make your life seem interesting.

36:25.348 --> 36:28.383
- Okay.
- Listen, I-I... no, I'm saying that

36:28.417 --> 36:31.052
with nothing but love and affection,
but you got to lighten up, man.

36:31.087 --> 36:33.666
You're opening a restaurant.
It's supposed to be fun.

36:33.676 --> 36:35.724
Yeah, well, she should've
run it by me at least.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.734
Well, tell her for next time.

36:40.463 --> 36:42.564
Listen, Harry, I'm a businessman,

36:42.598 --> 36:44.532
so I've done my due diligence.

36:44.567 --> 36:46.234
I checked up on Joss.

36:46.268 --> 36:49.104
She's got a strong
reputation in her field.

36:49.138 --> 36:51.272
Well liked. She's good at what she does.

36:51.307 --> 36:53.843
- Yeah, I know.
- But that means nothing

36:53.853 --> 36:56.378
if it's making your personal life hell.

36:56.412 --> 36:58.580
There are a million
publicists in this town,

36:58.614 --> 37:02.250
so if working with your fiancée is
a problem for you, then we don't.

37:02.284 --> 37:04.352
You can blame it on me if you like.

37:04.387 --> 37:06.254
It's your call.

37:10.389 --> 37:12.783
There are lots of other agents
out there, Dr. Kim.

37:12.793 --> 37:13.984
Not really.

37:13.994 --> 37:17.699
Not when your first book was
only somewhat successful.

37:17.733 --> 37:19.252
I can't afford to take another year off

37:19.262 --> 37:20.466
to write something on spec,

37:20.476 --> 37:23.938
and I don't know how to get
another deal without an agent.

37:23.973 --> 37:26.074
Maybe I should give up.

37:26.108 --> 37:28.109
Maybe I don't have another book in me.

37:28.144 --> 37:29.778
Of course you do.

37:29.812 --> 37:33.136
You have as many books
in you as I have songs.

37:33.567 --> 37:36.397
- You sing, Lila?
- Like an angel.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.821
Oh, I better get home.
I have to relieve the nanny.

37:39.855 --> 37:41.589
I'm not sure you should drive.

37:41.624 --> 37:43.958
- Oh, ooh.
- I'm not sure I should stand.

37:43.993 --> 37:47.276
Why don't you lie down,
take a nap before you go home?

37:47.286 --> 37:49.897
What am I doing with my life?

37:50.205 --> 37:52.333
Taking it day by day, Dr. Kim.

37:52.864 --> 37:54.483
Day by day.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.732
Next time, please talk to me
before you print something.

38:13.444 --> 38:14.729
Okay.

38:16.941 --> 38:18.577
I'm sorry that you hated what I wrote.

38:18.587 --> 38:22.052
Pfft. It's fine. Jonathan loved it.

38:22.062 --> 38:23.213
- Hmm.
- But then again,

38:23.223 --> 38:25.033
Jonathan does have questionable taste.

38:26.964 --> 38:28.809
I couldn't agree more.

38:28.819 --> 38:31.187
Did you see the monstrosity
in our living room?

38:31.221 --> 38:33.156
What monstrosity?

38:33.796 --> 38:36.659
- There's a monstrosity?
- Come here. Mm-hmm.

38:40.898 --> 38:42.791
Holy...

38:42.801 --> 38:45.431
Yeah. It's a little bit
extravagant, don't you think?

38:45.441 --> 38:47.296
Not to mention a blatant
disregard for public safety.

38:47.306 --> 38:49.467
_

38:49.477 --> 38:51.811
- I lo... I love it so much.
- Of course you do.

38:51.821 --> 38:54.172
I just... I can't... I can't...

38:57.614 --> 38:59.682
Oi, don't you have a bedroom
for that kind of nonsense?

38:59.717 --> 39:00.956
Look.

39:02.723 --> 39:04.988
- Let's take it for a spin.
- No! Hell no.

39:05.022 --> 39:06.529
You're not getting me on
the back of that donor-cycle.

39:06.539 --> 39:07.762
Yes, you are!

39:07.772 --> 39:08.992
- No!
- Grab a leather jacket.

39:09.026 --> 39:11.886
- We have to look cool, man!
- No! No!

39:27.611 --> 39:28.911
Hi.

39:36.471 --> 39:39.455
Guess what came back in stock.
Those Granada tiles you loved.

39:39.490 --> 39:41.024
They can be here by Friday.

39:41.058 --> 39:43.572
Does this mean you want
to be my designer again?

39:43.582 --> 39:45.377
If you'll have me.

39:48.657 --> 39:51.601
I would love that, April.
You know I would.

39:51.635 --> 39:54.037
I just don't want to ruffle
any more feathers with Marc.

39:54.071 --> 39:55.905
Marc is fine with it.

39:55.939 --> 39:59.142
Now that everything is out
in the open, it's all good.

39:59.687 --> 40:03.046
- You told him?
- I did. I hope that's okay.

40:03.926 --> 40:06.608
Of course, of course.

40:07.215 --> 40:08.692
And he was all right with everything?

40:08.702 --> 40:10.427
Marc is a very liberal guy.

40:10.437 --> 40:14.123
He would never take issue
with your... situation.

40:14.559 --> 40:16.469
- My being trans.
- Right.

40:16.479 --> 40:19.126
And of course, now he's not
threatened anymore.

40:19.136 --> 40:21.456
What does that mean, "of course"?

40:21.879 --> 40:24.333
No, it just means... you know...

40:24.368 --> 40:26.703
Right, now that you know
that I used to be a woman,

40:26.713 --> 40:28.370
you're not attracted to me anymore

40:28.380 --> 40:30.173
and he doesn't have to worry
about you cheating on him.

40:30.207 --> 40:33.539
- I was never attracted to you.
- Bull...

40:34.522 --> 40:36.968
I'm not saying we didn't have
a special connection,

40:36.978 --> 40:39.082
and maybe it was a bit confusing,

40:39.116 --> 40:40.450
but that was because I didn't realize

40:40.484 --> 40:41.918
what part of you I was connecting with.

40:41.952 --> 40:45.021
- And what part is that?
- Your female part inside.

40:45.055 --> 40:46.856
But now that I know the whole truth...

40:46.890 --> 40:48.591
You could never be
attracted to me again.

40:48.625 --> 40:50.026
- Of course not.
- And why is that?

40:50.060 --> 40:52.884
Because I would never
date a trans person.

41:00.723 --> 41:02.808
Get out of my house, April.

41:03.987 --> 41:05.341
Now.

41:27.831 --> 41:30.633
What the hell are you doing here?
