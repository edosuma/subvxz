what our training says to do.

09:46.421 --> 09:48.641
Exactly.
If we follow our training,

09:48.685 --> 09:51.644
we get out of here alive.
All of us.

09:51.688 --> 09:53.733
[groans]

09:53.777 --> 09:55.605
BOIMLER:
Ooh,

09:55.648 --> 09:57.215
I love me an undercover op.

09:57.258 --> 09:58.608
You could tell
the captain was bummed

09:58.651 --> 09:59.783
to have to stay on the ship.

09:59.826 --> 10:01.219
[chuckles]:
Badass like Riker,

10:01.262 --> 10:03.351
you know he'd rather
have boots on the ground.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.310
He must have been so bored
on the Enterprise.

10:05.353 --> 10:08.008
I mean,
seven years of what, exploring?

10:08.052 --> 10:10.620
On a ship
with five day care centers.

10:10.663 --> 10:12.883
Are you talking about the D?
The flagship?

10:12.926 --> 10:14.232
They went
to different dimensions.

10:14.275 --> 10:16.060
They fought the Borg.
They insurrected.

10:16.103 --> 10:17.670
They had
regular string quartets.

10:17.714 --> 10:19.977
-Wow, what a rush.
-[all but Boimler laughing]

10:20.020 --> 10:21.848
Play me a concerto.

10:21.892 --> 10:24.024
That's dumb.

10:26.766 --> 10:28.638
-[grunts]
-RANSOM: Uh, Captain?

10:28.681 --> 10:29.682
You feeling okay?

10:29.726 --> 10:31.597
Hmm? I'm fine. Why?

10:31.641 --> 10:33.904
This is typically about the time
you'd start asking

10:33.947 --> 10:35.993
for a second
or even third status report

10:36.036 --> 10:37.342
from the away team, but, uh,

10:37.385 --> 10:39.083
you haven't even asked
for one yet.

10:39.126 --> 10:42.173
Commander, are you suggesting
that I micromanage?

10:42.216 --> 10:44.001
-No, no, no. Not at all. I...
-Because that is

10:44.044 --> 10:46.090
what Starfleet Command
said in my evaluation.

10:46.133 --> 10:47.265
Can you believe that?

10:47.308 --> 10:50.137
Since when do I micromanage?

10:50.964 --> 10:55.403
I am going to have to "show
more trust in my subordinates."

10:55.447 --> 10:59.930
[exhales] Lieutenant Kayshon
is an accomplished officer.

10:59.973 --> 11:02.628
I am sure
he's got a handle on things.

11:03.498 --> 11:04.804
-[Tendi gasps]
-[Jet grunts]

11:04.848 --> 11:05.979
-[screams]
-[Rutherford grunting]

11:06.023 --> 11:07.981
Rutherford, take the puppet.

11:08.025 --> 11:10.592
-[puppet squeaks]
-Tendi, target the hinge.

11:11.332 --> 11:12.899
-[Jet grunts]
-[alarm blares]

11:12.943 --> 11:15.162
[Mariner screams, grunts]

11:16.947 --> 11:18.339
[screams]
Inorganic matter compactor!

11:18.383 --> 11:21.386
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Rutherford!

11:22.213 --> 11:24.955
-[screams]
-Don't let go!

11:24.998 --> 11:26.391
Hey, what the [bleep]?!
Little help?

11:26.434 --> 11:28.001
Not my problem!

11:32.658 --> 11:34.834
[all exhale]

11:41.406 --> 11:44.452
-RUTHERFORD: Huh?
-TENDI: Whoa.

11:45.236 --> 11:47.847
Hey! Thanks
for helping out back there.

11:47.891 --> 11:49.327
You couldn't lend
a frickin' tentacle?

11:49.370 --> 11:52.330
-Get your lousy hands off me.
-[Tendi gasps]

11:52.373 --> 11:55.115
Kahless's sex helmet?
You took it!

11:55.159 --> 11:56.595
That's what set off the ship!

11:56.638 --> 11:59.511
This is all your fault,
you pervert! No judgment.

11:59.554 --> 12:00.686
Oh, save it, Orion.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.732
I don't got to answer
to nobody but me.

12:02.775 --> 12:06.561
That's how I got on top,
that's how I'm staying on top.

12:06.605 --> 12:07.824
Don't move.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.216
[scoffs] I'm done
listening to youse.

12:09.260 --> 12:12.176
-[alarm blares]
-[gasps]

12:12.959 --> 12:15.092
Maybe his helmet saved him?

12:16.571 --> 12:17.834
[Mariner groans]

12:17.877 --> 12:19.661
Guess we have
to go up and over.

12:20.662 --> 12:22.882
[all grunting]

12:24.275 --> 12:27.887
Uh, remind me again
how this was the safer option?

12:27.931 --> 12:30.063
There's unknowns to any plan.

12:30.107 --> 12:32.022
If we'd gone your way,
we'd have had to fight

12:32.065 --> 12:33.501
twice as many collectables

12:33.545 --> 12:36.026
andfree-climb
a radiation coolant pipe.

12:36.069 --> 12:37.636
I'm not afraid of a little risk.

12:37.679 --> 12:39.769
-But what about them?
-[Tendi and Rutherford grunt]

12:39.812 --> 12:41.161
Maybe you've got a death wish,

12:41.205 --> 12:43.076
but you can't ask them
to follow you there.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.730
Oh, don't act like
you're watching out for them.

12:44.774 --> 12:47.385
You're just using them
to prop yourself up.

12:47.428 --> 12:49.387
What are you talking about?

12:49.430 --> 12:52.129
You want everyone to see you
as this big, brave hero

12:52.172 --> 12:53.870
who only cares
about the team, but...

12:53.913 --> 12:56.046
-[drone beeps]
-Oh, God, get out of here.
Stupid vacuum.

12:56.089 --> 12:57.612
[beeps]

12:58.483 --> 13:01.225
Uh-oh. I think you triggered
some kind of network response.

13:01.268 --> 13:03.531
Aw, what are they gonna do,
suck us to death?

13:03.575 --> 13:05.795
Ow!
[screams]

13:05.838 --> 13:07.927
They're gonna suck us to death!

13:07.971 --> 13:10.147
[grunting]

13:10.190 --> 13:12.279
There's too many of them!

13:15.761 --> 13:16.936
[panting]

13:16.980 --> 13:19.112
[grunting]

13:19.939 --> 13:21.245
We need a barricade.

13:21.288 --> 13:23.421
No, guys, grab a bone.
Just swing on 'em.

13:23.464 --> 13:25.771
-No, help me build.
-Don't listen to him.

13:25.815 --> 13:28.426
-Stand down, Mariner.
-Youstand down.

13:28.469 --> 13:30.471
-I told you to stand down.
You stand down.
-Uh...

13:32.125 --> 13:34.432
[weapons firing]

13:34.475 --> 13:38.044
We are strong.
We take your mine.

13:38.088 --> 13:40.655
It is our mine now.

13:43.441 --> 13:46.009
Stay strong, brother.
We miners shall overcome.

13:46.052 --> 13:47.401
Dude, you're clearly Starfleet.

13:47.445 --> 13:48.794
Your hands are super soft
and clean.

13:48.838 --> 13:50.883
Uh, no, I'm a miner
with a heart of gold.

13:50.927 --> 13:52.450
And I have dad issues.

13:52.493 --> 13:54.452
Okay, the Pakleds' shuttle
is unattended. Now's our chance.

13:54.495 --> 13:56.541
Hold it.
We got a 'Led over there.

13:57.368 --> 13:58.891
We have to stun him,
or he could sound

13:58.935 --> 14:00.327
-the alarm.
-But our orders are to avoid...

14:00.371 --> 14:01.938
We can't leave anything
up to chance.

14:01.981 --> 14:03.765
Oh.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.332
[grunts]

14:08.335 --> 14:10.947
Sorry, pal,
but this ain't your lucky...

14:10.990 --> 14:12.296
Huh?

14:12.339 --> 14:13.645
It's a pile of snacks.

14:13.688 --> 14:17.083
Hey! Those miners
are stealing our snacks.

14:17.127 --> 14:18.650
We're blown!

14:18.693 --> 14:21.174
Fall back to that tunnel!

14:25.526 --> 14:27.833
[grunts] There,
this should buy us some time.

14:27.877 --> 14:29.313
I'll try to come up with a plan.

14:29.356 --> 14:31.358
Enough with this whole
textbook leader routine.

14:31.402 --> 14:32.751
We're not buying it.

14:32.794 --> 14:33.926
I'm just trying to step up here.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.362
You'rethe one with the act.

14:35.406 --> 14:37.495
The whole
"dive in headfirst" thing.

14:37.538 --> 14:40.454
You're just desperate to be seen
as some kind of renegade hero.

14:40.498 --> 14:43.240
No, I'm not. Diving in
is just how I work best.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.894
And I like to think things out.

14:44.937 --> 14:47.505
Sorry if that comes off
all "textbook" to you.

14:47.548 --> 14:50.334
What, you think I'm trying to be
like Ransom up in here?

14:50.377 --> 14:52.640
Square jaw, all squinting,
like, "Let's roll"?

14:52.684 --> 14:54.860
[chuckles]
Uh, no, not a good look.

14:54.904 --> 14:57.950
I'm just surprised that you'd
ever trash-talk a superior.

14:57.994 --> 14:59.169
[laughs]
Are you kidding me?

14:59.212 --> 15:00.692
Don't even get me started
on Stevens.

15:00.735 --> 15:02.868
Do you know he keeps a log
about his mustache?

15:02.912 --> 15:04.217
[grunts]

15:04.261 --> 15:05.610
[Mariner grunts]

15:05.653 --> 15:07.829
Gah, this isn't gonna hold
much longer!

15:07.873 --> 15:11.094
If I had thought for one second
before I hit that stupid vacuum,

15:11.137 --> 15:12.356
none of this
would have happened.

15:12.399 --> 15:14.314
No, it was my call
to go this way.

15:14.358 --> 15:15.968
I led us into this mess.

15:16.012 --> 15:19.015
Great. So, then, what, neither
of us should be in charge?

15:19.058 --> 15:21.147
-Oh.
-Ha!

15:21.191 --> 15:23.802
-Rutherford, Tendi.
-What do you two
think we should do?

15:23.845 --> 15:26.631
-We two?
-I-I don't know,
this isn't really my...

15:26.674 --> 15:30.026
Well, actually,
these are Excalbian bones.

15:30.069 --> 15:32.767
With enough friction, they
break down and become acidic.

15:32.811 --> 15:34.552
Which we could use
to cut through the wall paneling

15:34.595 --> 15:36.336
and access
the engineering sub-conduits.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.816
And those run
the length of the ship.

15:37.859 --> 15:39.557
[chuckles]
Honestly, we could've bypassed

15:39.600 --> 15:41.211
all this scary stuff
by using them from the start.

15:41.254 --> 15:42.995
What?! Why didn't you
say something before?

15:43.039 --> 15:44.954
Because you guys were in charge.

15:44.997 --> 15:46.738
-Uh...
-Uh...

15:46.781 --> 15:48.783
[indistinct shouting]

15:50.263 --> 15:52.657
There. This will buy us
some time, but not much.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.746
-RIKER: Riker to away team.
-Go ahead.

15:54.789 --> 15:56.922
We've entered the system. What
the hell happened down there?

15:56.966 --> 15:59.620
Long story, sir.
Requesting emergency transport.

15:59.664 --> 16:01.274
-Get them out of there.
-I can't, sir.

16:01.318 --> 16:02.972
-Why the hell not?
-There's some sort

16:03.015 --> 16:04.538
of distortion field.

16:04.582 --> 16:06.366
It must be interfering
with the transporter.

16:06.410 --> 16:09.152
That Varuvian explosion
must have released an ion cloud.

16:09.195 --> 16:11.415
RIKER:
Hang in down there.
We'll figure this out.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.634
-[loud pounding]
-PAKLED: Get the saw!

16:13.678 --> 16:16.333
We need to hit the door
with the saw!

16:16.376 --> 16:17.769
[fierce yelling]

16:17.812 --> 16:19.771
[pounding, grunting]

16:19.814 --> 16:21.947
I can't say this is
how I pictured going out,

16:21.991 --> 16:23.383
but I'll tell you what,

16:23.427 --> 16:25.298
there's no other blokes
I'd rather be with.

16:25.342 --> 16:27.170
This is what
we signed up for, men:

16:27.213 --> 16:28.823
to boldly go.

16:29.824 --> 16:30.869
Boimler?

16:30.912 --> 16:31.957
Uh...

16:32.001 --> 16:33.350
I'm sorry, I gotta be honest.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.439
I didn't join Starfleet
to get in phaser fights.

16:35.482 --> 16:37.223
I signed up to explore,

16:37.267 --> 16:39.269
to be out in space
making new discoveries

16:39.312 --> 16:41.097
and peaceful
diplomatic solutions.

16:41.140 --> 16:42.837
That'sboldly going.

16:42.881 --> 16:44.100
And you know what?

16:44.143 --> 16:45.623
I'd love to be
in a string quartet.

16:45.666 --> 16:47.190
I love that when Riker was
on the Enterprise,

16:47.233 --> 16:48.800
he was out there jammin'
on the trombone

16:48.843 --> 16:51.324
and catching love disease
and acting in plays

16:51.368 --> 16:53.587
and meeting his identical
transporter clone Thomas.

16:53.631 --> 16:56.112
That stuff may not seem as cool
as what you guys do,

16:56.155 --> 16:58.070
but it's Starfleet all the way.

16:58.114 --> 16:59.550
[pounding continues]

16:59.593 --> 17:01.291
PAKLEDS:
Ha-ha! Ho-ho-ho!

17:01.334 --> 17:03.641
I got into Starfleet
to study moss.

17:03.684 --> 17:06.339
I joined up
'cause I love beaming.

17:06.383 --> 17:08.341
Thanks, Boimler.
If we're going out,

17:08.385 --> 17:10.343
at least it's remembering
that Starfleet

17:10.387 --> 17:12.737
isn't just about kicking
enemy ass.

17:12.780 --> 17:15.827
[chuckles]
Can't believe the captain has
a transporter clone.

17:15.870 --> 17:17.655
Yeah, Thomas Riker--
he was created

17:17.698 --> 17:19.874
from a distortion field
that was actually a lot like...

17:19.918 --> 17:21.137
[gasps]

17:21.180 --> 17:22.094
FIRST OFFICER:
What are you doing?

17:22.138 --> 17:23.617
We might not have to die!

17:27.317 --> 17:29.406
-Ah.
-[gasps]

17:31.843 --> 17:33.845
Ha-ha! Yeah!

17:33.888 --> 17:35.368
[grunts]

17:35.412 --> 17:37.849
Okay, the escape pods
should be down this way,

17:37.892 --> 17:39.111
if that's still the plan.

17:39.155 --> 17:40.852
It is if you say it is, buddy.

17:40.895 --> 17:43.159
Stay alert, stay alive.

17:43.202 --> 17:45.074
-Damn!
-Damn!

17:45.900 --> 17:48.468
RANSOM:
Captain, it's okay
if you want to check in

17:48.512 --> 17:50.340
-on Lieutenant Kayshon.
-No, no, no, no.

17:50.383 --> 17:52.690
[chuckles]:
I can be a hands-off captain.

17:52.733 --> 17:53.821
I don't mind.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.780
Captain,
two escape pods just launched

17:55.823 --> 17:58.696
-from the collector's ship.
-What?! On screen.

18:00.350 --> 18:01.699
What the hell is going on?

18:01.742 --> 18:04.049
The ship tried to collect us,
Captain.

18:04.093 --> 18:05.268
Where's Kayshon?

18:05.311 --> 18:07.531
Kayshon,
when he became a puppet.

18:07.574 --> 18:10.099
This is what being hands-off
gets me?

18:10.142 --> 18:12.884
Well, never again!

18:17.541 --> 18:18.933
[Pakleds grunting]

18:20.021 --> 18:21.545
Initiating drill.

18:21.588 --> 18:24.156
Reversing the polarity.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.636
I got signal lock.

18:25.679 --> 18:27.333
Get them out of there!
