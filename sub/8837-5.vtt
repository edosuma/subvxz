14:23.237 --> 14:26.281
THEN I'LL JUST
WALK TO SCHOOL WITH
SOMEONE WHO WILL.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.159
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:30.327 --> 14:34.080

WITH YOU?

14:52.641 --> 14:54.017
YEAH, BUT
NOT WHERE SHE
COULD SEE.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.602

BELIEVE ME.

YOUR FOLKS?

14:57.396 --> 15:00.648

LAUGHED AT ME,
BUT NOT REALLY.

IMAGINING THINGS.

15:06.655 --> 15:07.947
I EXPECT
HE'S RIGHT.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.324

15:09.491 --> 15:11.743

BEST FRIENDS.
