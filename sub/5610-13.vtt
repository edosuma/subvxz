Hey, Natalie.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.776
There is a desert
veiled in pavement

38:46.780 --> 38:48.600
Um, Ijust...

38:48.610 --> 38:51.499
You should know,
no matter where I am...

38:51.500 --> 38:54.207
And there's a city
of seven hills
...I'll always be
better than you.

38:54.210 --> 38:56.861
[ Chuckles ]
I'll catch up one day.

38:56.870 --> 39:00.988
And all our debris
flows to the ocean
You'll see.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.833
MIRANDA: The closer
you may be to a source,

39:03.840 --> 39:05.717
the better they may be,

39:05.720 --> 39:08.041
but then they have access
to your life.

39:08.050 --> 39:17.300
How could something so fair
be so cruel?

39:17.310 --> 39:21.019
When this black sun

39:21.020 --> 39:23.432
The most valuable thing
that I can tell you...

39:23.440 --> 39:25.271
Revolves around you
...is to be careful.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.852
Just because
someone is close to you...

39:28.860 --> 39:32.114
it doesn't mean
that they aren't dangerous.

39:38.120 --> 39:41.669
There is an answer
in a question

39:41.670 --> 39:44.047
Human intelligence can give you
the information you want.

39:44.050 --> 39:48.373
And there is hope
within despair

39:48.380 --> 39:52.805
And there is beauty
in a failure
But once you have it,
the question remains...

39:54.270 --> 39:56.591
And there are depths
beyond compare
...Who can you trust with it

39:56.600 --> 39:58.500
besides yourself?

40:01.100 --> 40:03.648

40:34.140 --> 40:35.801
It's okay. What do you need me
to do for you?

40:35.810 --> 40:37.095
You -- I don't know What to do,
Alex.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.169
You're not telling me anything.
-Okay, I don't --

40:38.180 --> 40:39.670
Do you need me to
check you in somewhere?

40:39.680 --> 40:41.898
Yes! Yes, can you check me in?
Can you please just check me in?

40:41.900 --> 40:43.549

[ Cellphone vibrating ]

40:53.950 --> 40:55.941
This is
Special Agent Ryan Booth.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.486
Put me through to Psych.

40:57.490 --> 40:59.276
I need to schedule
a voluntary admit.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.410
But it's so hard
for me to find

Please don't hurt them. Please
just -- just don't hurt them.

41:20.430 --> 41:21.897
THE VOICE: Whether any more
of them dies is up to you.

41:21.900 --> 41:23.720
I have another task for you.

41:23.730 --> 41:25.721
