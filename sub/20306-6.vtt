WEBVTT

00:01.292 --> 00:04.379
(chattering)

00:04.462 --> 00:06.589
Okay, let's go, come on, people!

00:07.132 --> 00:07.966
Order!

00:09.801 --> 00:11.678
Item one. Order!

00:12.554 --> 00:14.931
Item one. Drug wars.

00:16.975 --> 00:20.186
Night tour at County
has three dead junkie males.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.107
Brings the week's OD count to 14.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.778
Also got shootouts,
at, uh, Oswaldo's Carniceria

00:28.862 --> 00:31.072
as well as an after-hours joint
over on East Utica,

00:31.156 --> 00:33.950
that Special Narcotics
is calling war-related.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.869
Four dead, in these incidents.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.747
Brings the assigned dead number to 18.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.000
For the record...

00:44.335 --> 00:45.170
from Division.

00:45.670 --> 00:49.424
"The so-called Colombian wars or drug wars
are being investigated by,

00:49.632 --> 00:53.136
"and all cases or incidents
suspected of bearing a relation to same

00:53.219 --> 00:57.223
should be referred
to Division Special Narcotics."

00:57.307 --> 00:59.059
Yeah? What are they doing about it?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.560
You ain't a woman, Sergeant.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.064
It's a... it's a Special Narcotics matter,

01:04.481 --> 01:05.899
it's a Police Intelligence matter,

01:05.982 --> 01:07.484
but the bodies keep showing up
in our precincts.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.777
-WOMAN: That's right.
-(chattering)

01:08.860 --> 01:10.028
LUCY: Glad you could make it.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.988
RENKO: Baby boys like you
can't afford to be late.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.784
(chattering, hooting)

01:15.867 --> 01:16.743
Item two.

01:19.454 --> 01:22.040
Uh, this a.m. also marked the passing on,

01:22.123 --> 01:25.126
the untimely passing on
of the Reverend Booker Simon.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.378
The reverend was killed
trying to dissuade the theft

01:27.462 --> 01:29.214
of his imported German automobile.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.674
I understand that the reverend
was a pillar of this community.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.220
Stolen vehicle is a 1984 silver 325e. Heh.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.764
The reverend also knew his wheels.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.517
Night shift detectives
Russell and Sullivan are assigned,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.352
Lieutenant Goldblume is in charge.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.437
Item three, continuing operations.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.815
Mike Belker's undercover
at Hudson Auto Parts.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.818
Officer Coffey, Sergeant Bates,
Detective Garibaldi and Mayo

01:49.901 --> 01:53.279
are on hooker patrol in the red quarter
at Dekker and 116th.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.156
-(whispers)
-Men are johns, women make the pops.

01:55.657 --> 01:56.658
Item four-- Oh.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.828
Um, third tour officers are reminded,

01:59.911 --> 02:03.331
you've only got two weeks left
to re-qualify for pistol usage.

02:03.414 --> 02:06.042
Now, if you ignored
the noticed in your box...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.128
this is your last shot.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.506
-(groaning)
-(scattered boos)

02:13.049 --> 02:15.385
All right. Okay, people. Let's, uh...

02:15.468 --> 02:16.803
Let's get out there. Let's...

02:18.263 --> 02:20.431
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:20.807 --> 02:21.641
Let's roll.

02:21.891 --> 02:26.688
Nothing like that old-time religion
and a BMW to deliver the good word.

02:27.063 --> 02:28.273
He was a good man, Renko.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.234
(chattering)

02:31.693 --> 02:33.194
It's a classic Millsian equation, Henry.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.364
Excess competition,
too much product chasing too few dollars

02:36.447 --> 02:38.533
with a resulting rise in product quality.

02:38.616 --> 02:42.036
More drugs, no more money.
Better drugs to compete for that money.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.330
So when are you gonna give me my TV back?

02:44.789 --> 02:46.875
Mr. Coleman, I have told you--

02:46.958 --> 02:51.171
I am making a career of telling you
your television is evidence,

02:51.254 --> 02:52.630
and I'm trying to persuade

02:52.714 --> 02:55.383
the district attorney's office
to authorize its return.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.634
When?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.761
I'm sorry, I just can't say.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.223
I took a second job
just so's I could pay for that TV.

03:02.307 --> 03:06.811
Ain't bad enough I get it from out there,
you people stick it to me from this side.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.771
You just don't let up!

03:08.855 --> 03:10.481
You got a problem here, Mrs. Furillo?

03:10.565 --> 03:13.276
You're the problem!
You people are the problem!

03:13.359 --> 03:14.903
Now, let's calm down now here, sir.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.738
You calm down!

03:17.530 --> 03:18.948
I want my TV!

03:19.032 --> 03:20.617
Is that your TV over there?

03:21.242 --> 03:22.952
(grunts)

03:25.079 --> 03:25.914
Thanks.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.916
You can get up now, Mrs. Furillo.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.585
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:30.919 --> 03:32.712
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:32.795 --> 03:36.424
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:36.507 --> 03:38.176
(sirens wailing)

03:43.640 --> 03:46.267
(theme song playing)

05:07.849 --> 05:09.517
(siren blaring)

05:18.651 --> 05:20.778
-Good morning, sir.
-Overdose?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.697
-Yeah, for a change.
-Who's that?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.825
Name's Carlos Saldana,
he's a nickel dealer.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.619
Personally, I don't think this guy
had anything to do with it.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.330
You're comin' at me, man,
you're comin' at the wrong guy.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.874
You came to us, Carlos.
You came walking out that door.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.500
Cat's gotta live someplace, right?

05:36.210 --> 05:37.712
-Look, you wanna know what happened?
-Yeah.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.506
CARLOS: All right, say five guys
want to score a deck, right?

05:40.965 --> 05:43.718
One of 'em's gotta be the guinea pig
because the stuff is just so strong,

05:43.801 --> 05:46.888
and, uh, looks like it
was his turn today, that's all.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.349
If you sold it to him,
you're a murderer, Carlos.

05:49.432 --> 05:52.226
Hey, all I did was live in this building,
man, get up and go to breakfast.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.937
You'd be doing everybody a favor
popping these Colombians, man.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.982
They are moving 20 percent doojie
to street junkies.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.402
No, it's busting the market,
just making trouble for everybody.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.948
Cat cops from me, knows what he's getting.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.617
Yeah, a bunch of garbage.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.534
Absolutely.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.995
It's gonna buzz 'em a little,
but it's gonna keep 'em alive.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.705
Don't be knocking garbage, man.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.999
Garbage lets you scuffle another day.

06:16.751 --> 06:17.877
You the arresting officer?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.796
No, Officer Hill.

06:20.630 --> 06:21.464
Yeah.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.049
-What's your name?
-Harry.

06:25.009 --> 06:25.927
Hang on a second.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.106
Sorry, where were we?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.525
Uh, we were wondering if you were working.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.945
-Anything's possible.
-All right, what's a taste?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.947
Thirty. Twelve for the room.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.574
Sorry kid, I'm a cop.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.577
-Oh, no.
-Hey, hold it, hold it, hold it.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.956
-Top Dog, we got a pickup.
-Do you have to arrest me?

06:55.039 --> 06:58.167
Uh-huh. You're too young to be doing this.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.461
You know, you seem like a nice lady, Lana.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.339
-Hate to have to do this.
-Hate to do what, honey?

07:04.173 --> 07:06.342
I'm a cop. You're under arrest.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.345
-I don't believe it.
-Yeah, well, believe it.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.305
2203, I got one.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.474
-Get a disease.
-Come on.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.644
The death of Booker Simons
represents a loss for all of us

07:16.727 --> 07:19.522
inspired by his work as a leader
of the Hill community,

07:19.605 --> 07:21.649
and a champion of the underprivileged.

07:21.732 --> 07:25.319
The police department intends
to find Booker Simons' killer.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.280
-Progress on the Simons murder, Captain?
-No comment.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.657
You want to buy a scorecard
on the drug war, Captain?

07:29.740 --> 07:31.617
No comment on that subject, either.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.202
Sleep in this morning, Frank?

07:33.286 --> 07:36.956
I want access to department intelligence
on those Colombian dealers.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.125
We've gone around
in this circle before, Frank.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.669
(sighs) Precinct's turning
into a graveyard.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.590
It's a citywide problem.
It's better coordinated out of Division.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.509
Frank, these vermin'll
be killing each other tomorrow, too.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.386
Now, who've we got on the Simons killing?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.806
Call was taken by the night shift,
Henry Goldblume is supervising.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.101
Henry?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.061
I want us aggressive on this, Frank.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.273
The Reverend was a good man
with a substantial constituency.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.984
Track the Simons investigation for me.

08:05.943 --> 08:06.903
Professional job.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.280
Thief disconnected the car alarm.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.700
Reverend Simons was awakened
by his dog barking, went outside.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.620
His wife heard shots, two gunshots.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.121
When she got to the window,
the car was driving away,

08:17.205 --> 08:19.248
she got outside,
her husband was dead in the street.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.249
Description?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.210
No description from Mrs. Simons
or the neighbor.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.836
Okay, if it was professional

08:24.253 --> 08:26.214
there's no way that car
is still in one piece.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.925
Your ongoings list a chop shop undercover.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.053
We need at least a week
to mature to this operation, Chief.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.430
We're after suppliers
as well as the garage operator.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.682
Frank, I want a way to that car thief.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.645
G-O-O...

08:40.728 --> 08:41.854
Not how it's spelled.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.273
You said "Goo."

08:44.357 --> 08:46.901
It's pronounced "Goo,"
but it's spelled "G-U-E."

08:49.946 --> 08:50.947
Lose something?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.616
(chuckles) Haven't we met before?

08:54.492 --> 08:55.993
I work Dekker and 116th.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.622
Uh, no, no, no, I mean, during a--
During a previous arrest.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.708
Uh... sorry.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.835
Another lady of the morning for you, Leo.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.337
-Hi, kid.
-Hi.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.465
This way Miss, uh... "Gway."

09:10.091 --> 09:11.801
"Goo." "Gway" is how it's spelled.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.052
Yeah, sure, toots.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.308
Neal, J.D., we're gonna make
arrests at Hudson Auto Parts.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.060
But that's Belker's undercover.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.395
He's just setting it up, Captain.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.021
This is not a debate, Detective.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.982
Your captain will explain
what we're after.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.610
Chief.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.743
-Mrs. Simons?
-Yes?

09:37.827 --> 09:40.288
Fletcher Daniels. Deepest sympathies.

09:41.038 --> 09:44.000
Are you going to catch the man
who killed my husband, Chief Daniels?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.460
We're going to bring every resource
of this department

09:46.544 --> 09:48.045
to bear on doing just that.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.172
You're in good hands here.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.468
I've never trusted that man.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.932
Mrs. Simons, is there anything
else I can do for you?

10:00.891 --> 10:04.020
Grateful, your giving me
these claim forms.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.522
No, I mean anything-- anything more?

10:08.024 --> 10:11.485
There were so many people who thought
so much of your husband, myself included.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.363
You can't give him back to me.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.828
-Please excuse me.
-Oh, of course.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.164
Please keep me informed of the progress.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.582
I will.

10:30.004 --> 10:30.838
(door closes)

10:30.921 --> 10:32.632
MAN: Knock when you're done, Lieutenant.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.021
It's cold.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.856
I thought maybe you'd like
a cup of coffee.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.316
Thanks.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.616
That's a big gun.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.868
Well, it, uh, does the job.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.873
So, uh... you're a prostitute.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.126
You know, being a prostitute
is nothing to be ashamed of.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.629
It's a time-honored profession.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.881
A victimless offense at worst.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.550
Oh, yeah? Then how come I'm in here?

11:16.634 --> 11:19.470
(chuckles) Well, if it were up to me,
you wouldn't be.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.014
Unfortunately, you ran afoul

11:22.098 --> 11:25.101
of the guardians
of this unenlightened society.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.562
So how come you keep
staring at my breasts?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.483
Oh, inadvertently, I assure you, uh...

11:33.192 --> 11:34.193
I'm nearsighted.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.153
You're horny.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.613
I beg your pardon?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.949
You're a horny cop looking for a freebie.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.034
I have never gotten a freebie in my life.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.037
That is to say that I that I have never

11:45.121 --> 11:47.540
tried to take unfair advantage
in a situation.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.500
Well, take advantage of these, buster.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.878
You get me out of here, and I'll let you
do a lot more than just stare.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.505
Madam, restrain yourself.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.007
What are you gonna do, arrest me?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.009
Oh, Judas.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.305
(tools buzzing loudly)

12:03.389 --> 12:04.223
Hey.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.476
Come on. Come on, hey!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.437
Hey! Come on!

12:09.520 --> 12:12.398
Come on, the serial number's right there.
You gotta bear down.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.983
I'm going as fast as I can.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.985
And I'm tellin' you, pick up the pace.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.820
We turn these jobs over in two hours.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.781
That's ten minutes to lose serial numbers
or you'll foul up the works.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.408
-All right.
-And you are flunking this test!

12:23.033 --> 12:23.909
All right.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.083
-(horn honks)
-What's that? There's nobody scheduled.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.086
Police, everybody freeze! Get him!

12:36.130 --> 12:37.590
Hey, you, out! You, out!

12:37.673 --> 12:38.883
Come on out!

12:40.050 --> 12:42.386
It's me, LaRue! It's me!

12:43.804 --> 12:45.890
(panting)

12:51.187 --> 12:53.522
You're saying you couldn't drop
a dime to warn me?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.982
We tried, the line was busy.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.108
So you call back!

12:56.192 --> 12:58.277
Hey, go chew on the captain's leg, okay?

12:58.360 --> 13:01.614
Our orders were to take this dump fast
and get that slop to roll over.

13:01.697 --> 13:02.531
Not good enough.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.367
I'm tellin' you, I know nothing
about the death of no reverend,

13:05.451 --> 13:08.788
and I did not commission
the theft of no silver 325e!

13:08.871 --> 13:11.290
We're giving you a chance here, Tony.
Don't be stupid twice, man.

13:11.373 --> 13:13.751
Well, believing that little crumb
was a grease monkey was my first mistake.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.044
Concentrate, Tony,

13:15.127 --> 13:17.046
'cause a metal bimbo like you
has gotta work real hard to follow.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.924
Now, maybe you didn't put out the order
to take that car last night

13:20.007 --> 13:20.966
and maybe it wasn't pieced out here--

13:21.050 --> 13:22.551
It definitely was not!

13:22.635 --> 13:25.095
Okay, but you're still had on multiple
counts of receiving stolen property

13:25.179 --> 13:28.015
and you do know guys
who specialize boosting certain makes.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.601
-It's a possibility.
-Stay tuned, Tony.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.813
We want the guy who took the reverend's
car 'cause he also croaked him.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.941
And we want to catch him doing a crime
so we can get a warrant for his apartment

13:37.024 --> 13:39.109
so we can look for evidence
into the reverend's death.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.779
You're gonna put the word out
that you want a 325e.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.781
Whoever delivers, we're gonna pop 'em.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.242
For that I walk?

13:46.909 --> 13:48.035
For that, you waddle.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.705
You're gonna tell 'em there's a two grand
bonus if it's delivered by four.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.543
Let me make some calls.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.216
-Top floor.
-Mr. Foster, I repeat,

14:02.299 --> 14:05.761
I'm in no mood for jokes,
practical or otherwise,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.680
this high above sea level, sir.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.015
It ain't no joke, officer.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.727
-Wait'll we-- (gags)
-(coughing)

14:14.520 --> 14:15.354
See?

14:17.106 --> 14:17.940
Ugh!

14:19.483 --> 14:21.193
There's a body in there, minimum.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.570
What do you mean, minimum?

14:23.821 --> 14:25.364
-You ready?
-Yeah.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.702
(both coughing, groaning)

14:30.786 --> 14:33.414
All right, let's get 'em blankets
so they don't--

14:39.295 --> 14:41.922
(gags)

14:42.006 --> 14:43.048
(animal bleating)

14:51.140 --> 14:52.975
(bleating)

14:53.434 --> 14:54.393
Oh, lordy.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.481
Imagine that.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.194
Chief, does it bother you
that we may be commissioning

15:04.278 --> 15:05.905
the theft of a citizen's automobile?

15:07.865 --> 15:10.200
Sure the chop shop owner's gonna lead them
to the cars we put out,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.620
that doesn't mean those are the ones
they're gonna steal.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.081
Yeah, all right.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.584
Okay, we'll just hope for the best.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.922
-Authorization?
-Four bait cars.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.256
I'll tell Neal and J.D.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.967
Uh, they weren't able to tip Belker
about the bust.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.344
Neal says Mick's a little hot.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.804
Okay, next time I see him. Thanks, Henry.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.686
Come on in here.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.813
Come on, hey, hey, hey, come on.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.193
-You weren't kidding.
-No, we were not kidding, Leo.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.862
Me and my partner
are in dire need of fumigation.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.615
And our unit smells like the inside
of my granddaddy's farm.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.867
-Where do we put her?
-How do you know it's a she?

15:52.284 --> 15:55.245
Tag here says "Fifi."
I assume that it's a female.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.289
Holding cell for now.
I'll call the Humane Society.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.290
This way, ma'am.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.674
-Carla Walicki?
-She's in lineup.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.009
Uh, here's her paperwork, Ms. Davenport.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.554
You might want to check her ID.
If she's 18, I'm 80.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.556
RENKO: Mrs. Doris Crandell?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.226
This is Officer Andrew Renko
at Hill Street, Mrs. Crandell.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.729
I'm afraid I have some very sorrowful news
with regard to your spouse.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.440
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.569
Any proof of that besides
your obviously forged driver's license?

16:28.237 --> 16:29.196
What else do I need?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.907
Have you held a job any place
where they'd have you on record?

16:33.534 --> 16:36.370
I've been taking classes
at the Medical Careers downtown.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.956
Training for hospital cafeteria.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.625
My boyfriend, he's in mechanics classes.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.253
We're gonna move out
to Long Beach, California

16:44.336 --> 16:46.422
so he can start work
in the defense plants.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.966
I want it so bad.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.636
Just looked like working the streets
a few weeks was gonna be the fastest way.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.264
Your boyfriend agree to this?

16:56.015 --> 16:59.476
No. No, he didn't know.
He doesn't know anything about it.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.770
But I just can't be here anymore.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.315
Do you have family, Carla?

17:05.858 --> 17:06.859
Father.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.652
He's the one ought to be locked up.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.155
He's why I have to go.

17:12.031 --> 17:12.865
(breath shaking)

17:13.532 --> 17:16.702
He's made relations with me
ever since I was 11 years old.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.205
Miss, please, if they think I'm any
younger, they're gonna send me home.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.542
Or to Juvenile Hall.
My friends say that's as worse as home.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.544
I'm really 18, really.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.382
Woman's prerogative.

17:30.966 --> 17:31.800
What?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.011
We'll see what we can do.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.310
That's right, officers,
treat my clients like barnyard critters.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.311
Pen 'em up with the animals.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.813
It's a temporary situation, sir.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.357
We're doing our best to clear it up.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.985
-Among other things.
-(coughs)

17:50.319 --> 17:52.571
-The forms you requested, Mr. Brown.
-Thanks.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.992
What? What? Am I E.F. Hutton?

17:57.076 --> 17:57.910
Jesus?

17:59.328 --> 18:01.246
Jesus Martinez Jimenez, correct.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.665
My apprentice.
Can we help you with something, Captain?

18:03.749 --> 18:07.377
Yeah, may I borrow
Mr. Martinez Jimenez for a minute?

18:07.461 --> 18:11.048
Yeah, as long as I'm being detained with
these hummer charges against my clients.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.136
I think that guy's in one of my classes.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.016
I go to school, I'm working paralegal
with Attorney Brown.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.393
Eventually,
I plan to put up my own shingle.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.064
Will you stop looking at me
as if I were a Martian, Frankie?

18:27.439 --> 18:30.901
Got some whiskers, gained a few pounds
with a wife home cooking.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.486
But I'm still Jesus.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.695
Did you say a law school?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.864
Night law school, correct.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.534
Okay, where are your diplomas?

18:38.617 --> 18:41.537
I may not be educated,
but I've had an education.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.998
Diplomas, Jesus.
High school and college diplomas.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.626
It came into my possession.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.295
Maybe that's why I'm known
as Martinez Jimenez.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.213
No good.

18:54.216 --> 18:58.929
As long as I can pass the law courses,
who cares as if I didn't take biology?

19:00.180 --> 19:01.682
You gonna blow the whistle on me?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.477
Guys always getting educated.
I should try to get ahead.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.939
All right, just don't represent
anybody around here, okay?

19:09.398 --> 19:12.151
While in training?
It would be unethical, Frankie.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.527
They're clean, Detective.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.322
Mick?

19:17.614 --> 19:18.991
You know I could've shot him?

19:25.664 --> 19:29.084
I coulda shot LaRue.
And what's worse, he coulda shot me.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.087
Henry said you weren't told that they were
gonna be moving on Yankovich.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.005
MICK: Oh, that's correct.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.923
I wanna know what the hell's going on.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.967
Shift in priorities, Mick.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.762
They were pushing for a way to the thief
who took the Reverend Simons' car.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.930
I heard all that.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.059
I'm waiting to hear about the department
protecting its men in the field,

19:46.143 --> 19:47.644
'cause I am alone out their, Captain.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.438
I'm swinging in the wind out there.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.648
No excuses.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.525
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.279
But I want you back in that operation.

19:58.071 --> 19:58.906
Yes, sir.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.244
That memo was supposed to be read
before every roll call.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.206
-Inspector, it got read.
-Then you disobeyed an order.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.916
The guy died from Colombian smack.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.251
Sir, we were sent out
on another call after the LD.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.586
We were just gonna do the paperwork.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.671
All right, listen to this.
All cases or incidents--

20:14.755 --> 20:16.673
All cases or incidents suspected
of bearing a relation--

20:16.757 --> 20:18.425
-to the Colombian drug wars--
-We seen that at roll call.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.219
Inspector Keenan,
I'd like to see you in my office.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.055
...Division Special Narcotics.
Whose side are you on, guys, huh?

20:25.098 --> 20:28.560
I'm sick of this crap, I can't get any
information while it's usable.

20:29.061 --> 20:29.895
(door shuts)

20:29.978 --> 20:31.939
You have a problem with this precinct,
you bring it to me.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.024
(bitter laugh)
Oh, I've got a problem, all right.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.443
Let's hear it. I don't want you
out the grilling my uniforms.

20:36.526 --> 20:40.614
These Colombians got no history.
They got no stable distribution network.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.116
The only place I'm gonna nail
'em is in the streets.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.993
And I'm getting zero cooperation
from the precinct.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.204
And how much cooperation
have you been giving?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.455
What's the matter, Furillo?

20:49.164 --> 20:53.627
You afraid of getting Jerry Fuchs's
carcass out from behind our necks?

20:54.544 --> 20:56.046
Afraid we might get on our feet again?

20:56.129 --> 20:57.631
No, I want you on your feet again.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.259
I want vice and narcotics
out of my squad room.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.095
But you people keep making
the same mistake over and over again.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.763
You want us to do your scut work,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.890
then you handle your cases
as if you were the Kremlin.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.308
You calling me a damn communist?

21:08.392 --> 21:11.561
I'm saying you conduct your investigations
behind closed doors.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.773
Then you wonder why the precincts
don't do somersaults trying to help you.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.192
Twelve of those 17 deaths
were in my precinct,

21:17.276 --> 21:18.902
yet I haven't received
one phone call from you

21:18.986 --> 21:20.904
regarding the status of the investigation.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.240
It's not Jerry Fuchs
hanging around your neck.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.367
It's your trying to rehabilitate
your reputation

21:25.450 --> 21:26.868
at the expense of good police work.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.334
I want those reports in two hours.
All right?

21:35.168 --> 21:37.838
I'll ask my men to get them
to you as quickly as they can.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.299
No, two hours,
or I'm gonna make this case, Furillo.

21:42.092 --> 21:42.926
All right?

21:47.222 --> 21:50.309
I put four showroom 325es
on the street, J.D.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.476
You promised me paper.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.270
Rob, you got the chief's
personal guarantee.

21:53.353 --> 21:57.316
A hundred bucks per unit per day,
all damages, retail compensation for loss.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.152
-What, the chief's got writer's cramp?
-They gotta draw up the papers!

22:00.235 --> 22:02.904
My own brother-in-law.
You want me to sign something?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.282
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'm really low on toilet paper.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.076
Them taking one of his cars.
That ain't part of my deal, is it?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.454
-Not your part of it, Tony.
-These guys are real picky.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.165
They may case a piece a couple
weeks before they boost it.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.208
(horn honking)

22:15.292 --> 22:16.335
Could be a bingo.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.378
MAN: All right, take your stations.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.504
Open the door.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.093
(power tools whirring)

22:32.100 --> 22:32.976
TONY: Hey, Louis.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.315
Where you want it, Tony?
Bonus before 4:00, am I right?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.275
-Jail.
-MICK: Police officers, you're under--

22:40.359 --> 22:41.360
-Hey! Hey!
-(tires screeching)

22:43.320 --> 22:44.738
Backups, suspect is--

22:54.414 --> 22:56.416
(tires screeching)

22:57.376 --> 22:58.668
(horn honking)

23:00.420 --> 23:03.882
(sirens approaching)

23:17.020 --> 23:18.230
(grunts)

23:21.691 --> 23:22.651
Dirt bag!

23:28.240 --> 23:29.825
MICK: You are under arrest.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.916
My husband was an eccentric man.
There's no point in denying it.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.710
Well, uh, ma'am,
we all have our little habits.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.463
He disappeared two
and three days at a time.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.966
Never this long, though. Never a week.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.426
I knew something was wrong.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.887
Is this Mrs. Crandall?

23:50.971 --> 23:51.930
Yeah, Sergeant.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.016
Ma'am, Humane is here.

23:56.351 --> 24:00.522
Awkward as it is, there's a question
of ownership of the animal.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.483
There was an animal involved?

24:04.443 --> 24:06.778
(clears throat) Yeah.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.196
Ma'am, there was a...

24:09.656 --> 24:11.491
-Sheep.
-...sheep in the room.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.077
I-It may not have belonged
to your husband.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.580
No, it was probably Charlie's.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.749
That men cared for every wounded creature.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.546
Well ma'am,
are you going to take ownership?

24:24.754 --> 24:27.132
No. No, I won't.

24:27.632 --> 24:31.887
I like animals, but I'm not a fanatic
the way Charlie was.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.810
It's gonna be hard enough with Binky.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.813
-Binky?
-Binky?

24:43.023 --> 24:45.859
That little schnauzer loved his master so.

24:49.362 --> 24:51.490
MICK: Louis Clay, auto theft and resist.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.117
Henry, mighta helped you
with this Simons killing.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.454
We just busted a guy boosting
a 325e, Louis Clay.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.998
Only way to warrant his apartment
is the garage owner verifies

25:00.081 --> 25:01.666
he's a specialist stealing that make.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.168
Hey, owner says he'll verify.

25:04.377 --> 25:06.505
Call it in, will you, J.D.?
I want to get the captain up to speed.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.506
-Good job.
-Right.

25:08.715 --> 25:09.549
Got a warrant.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.093
-Henry.
-What's up, Fay?

25:12.177 --> 25:15.388
Did I hear John LaRue say there's been
an arrest in the Reverend Simons killing?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.098
-A Louis Clay?
-No.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.726
-I thought I--
-We're booking an auto theft suspect.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.186
I don't know what he'll be charged with.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.104
-Phone call, Mrs. Furillo.
-Thanks, Natalie.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.190
-Did I misunderstand--
-Look, I'm a little busy right now, Fay,

25:25.273 --> 25:27.526
And you're not supposed to be asking
questions like that.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.320
Well, excuse me for living, mister.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.822
Victim's Aid.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.034
Oh, hello, Mrs. Simons.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.917
Well... in absolute confidence,
there may be some progress.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.919
Does it look as if Clay
might be cooperative?

25:46.002 --> 25:46.836
Let's try him.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.215
Captain, they towed the car
that Clay stole to impound.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.883
No registration. We're running the plates.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.886
Stan, what public defenders
do we have to do intake?

25:54.970 --> 25:56.054
I'm afraid none, Captain.

25:56.137 --> 25:57.597
-(phone ringing)
-They're all in court.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.849
Captain, we got the warrant
on Clay's apartment.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.351
-Okay, you and Neal.
-Yes, sir.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.270
-The A-toss, J.D.
-Gotcha, Captain.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.605
-(phone hangs up)
-Captain, officer down.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.482
Impound lot, 119th.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.407
(siren wails)

26:19.160 --> 26:19.995
Hello, Captain.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.376
(indistinct chatter)

26:33.049 --> 26:34.301
MAN: Push it out of the way.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.891
OFFICER: They were rabid.
They were ethnics.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.268
Think they were Latin.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.479
They shot us,
and they went right for that car.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.357
They tried to drive it away,
but we had it booted.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.776
They couldn't drive it. They had a torch.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.194
Look, I've gotta get him
to the damn hospital.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.112
Go, go.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.869
Only thing missing is the door.
It has to be drugs.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.121
Had to be drugs stashed in the door.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.457
Look at the level of violence.
This is them animals.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.833
Description did say Latin.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.918
You got the guy
who stole the car in custody.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.170
Louis Clay.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.171
KEENAN: This could be the break.

27:11.254 --> 27:14.257
We find out where he stole the car from,
we got away to these dealers.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.885
Why don't we lean on Clay
for that address, Frank?

27:16.968 --> 27:18.428
I want to question him, Chief.

27:18.511 --> 27:20.347
Clay's also a murder suspect
in my precinct.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.015
He's gonna be questioned
by my detectives first.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.308
Fine, no problem.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.268
You don't mind if I'm
in the precinct house.

27:29.147 --> 27:35.320
Next on the calendar, 27-2752,
Carla Walicki, solicitation.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.828
JUDGE: Application, Mr. DA?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.873
Arrested on a prostitution sweep,
Your Honor.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.833
People request a hundred
dollars or 30 days.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.918
-(coughing)
-JOYCE: A word, Your Honor?

27:50.418 --> 27:51.419
Approach.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.464
(coughing continues)

27:54.547 --> 27:57.258
The defendant is 18 years old,
Ms. Davenport?

27:57.634 --> 28:00.887
Best outcome would be to allow Ms. Walicki
to plead as an adult, Your Honor,

28:00.970 --> 28:03.807
My understanding is
the family situation is not a healthy one.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.892
-(coughing)
-Ms. Walicki intends to pursue

28:05.975 --> 28:08.353
legitimate job opportunities
in California.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.064
-Do we believe her?
-We give her the benefit of the doubt.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.234
Any objection to reducing it
to Disorderly Conduct?

28:14.317 --> 28:15.318
No objection, Your Honor.

28:16.027 --> 28:16.861
Stand back.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.698
(coughing continues)

28:19.781 --> 28:23.702
JUDGE: This, uh, court understands that
you intend to move California, young lady.

28:23.785 --> 28:24.744
CARLA: That's right, sir.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.706
JUDGE: And you have gainful employment
waiting for you there?

28:27.789 --> 28:30.291
CARLA: Yes, sir. Um, my fiancé does, too.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.085
JUDGE: Well, I sincerely
hope that's the case,

28:32.168 --> 28:36.089
because if you appear before this court
another time on solicitation,

28:36.172 --> 28:39.217
I guarantee you,
I'm not gonna be very sympathetic.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.636
Disorderly Conduct, how do you plead?

28:42.053 --> 28:43.012
Guilty, sir.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.057
A twenty dollar fine.
Good luck in California.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.434
-(bangs gavel)
-Next case.

28:49.686 --> 28:55.483
27-2753, Lotta "Guay." Solicitation.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.277
Gue.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.196
JUDGE: Mr. DA?

29:00.947 --> 29:03.950
Repeat offender, Your Honor,
60 days or two hundred dollars.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.662
JUDGE: Mm-hm. Okay, Mr. Brown.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.123
How does Ms., uh, Gue plead?

29:10.498 --> 29:11.958
Martinez Jimenez, Your Honor.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.627
-Jesus Martinez Jimenez.
-JUDGE: Sorry.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.796
Mr. Brown's got a frog in his throat.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.924
Okay, Mr. Martinez Jimenez,
how does she plea?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.886
Uh, we go with<i> Finken v. Green,</i>
Your Honor.

29:22.969 --> 29:26.389
No, no, I asked for a plea,
not a precedent.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.975
JESUS: Ah, oh. Plea, huh?

29:29.058 --> 29:31.936
(muttering in Spanish)

29:32.520 --> 29:34.773
-<i>Finken v.--</i>
-Guilty, Your Honor.

29:35.231 --> 29:38.067
-I'll try not to do it anymore.
-JUDGE: Two hundred dollar fine.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.654
Your next offense
is a 90-day incarceration, Ms. Gue.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.906
I hear, Your Honor.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.282
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.533
JUDGE: Mr. Martinez Jimenez.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.659
-(gavel thuds)
-JUDGE: Next case.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.167
Uh, Ms. Davenport,

29:54.417 --> 29:56.503
you're urgently requested
to return to Hill Street Station.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.837
How many more have you got?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.923
Just Mr. Sloan for vagrancy, Your Honor.

30:00.465 --> 30:05.386
Okay, released on recognizance.
Mr. Sloan, go and sin no more!

30:05.470 --> 30:07.555
(bangs gavel) Ten minute recess.

30:07.639 --> 30:11.059
(people murmuring)

30:11.142 --> 30:12.310
Is my husband all right?

30:12.769 --> 30:15.021
Just said they wanted you up there,
Ms. Davenport.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.314
Thank you.

30:19.859 --> 30:20.985
Uh, Robert Silver.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.571
They just rotated me over
from tax court for 30 days.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.114
Uh, Martinez Jimenez.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.742
I don't know what happened to my man,
Brown, he must've strangled.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.744
Uh, what was that precedent
you were citing?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.329
-Fifken versus--
-No, no, no.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.499
<i>You in the Courts. </i>By Finken V. Green.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.001
He wrote the whole damn book.

30:39.921 --> 30:40.922
This is Joyce Davenport.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.049
Sergeant Jablonski,
is my husband all right?

30:45.426 --> 30:47.387
Good. I'm on my way.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.055
-BILLY: Why'd you do it?
-CARLA: Please, Billy.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.807
BILLY: You make me sick. You're garbage.

30:50.890 --> 30:54.227
Billy, I'm sorry, I only did it
so we can get to California.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.520
8-Tramp! You whore!
-Billy!

30:55.603 --> 30:57.856
What, were you selling
yourself in the streets?

30:57.939 --> 30:59.357
(sobs)

31:06.865 --> 31:09.158
FRANK: Yes, I told you-- Right, thank you.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.494
-You get an address from Clay yet?
-No, he's still in with--

31:11.578 --> 31:13.288
Neal and J.D. are still working on him.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.248
Well, we may have been the Simons killing.

31:15.915 --> 31:17.667
Police labs say the bullets
from the piece in his apartment

31:17.750 --> 31:20.003
are a caliber match,
match on gross examination

31:20.086 --> 31:21.796
How long before full ballistics results?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.172
-Testing now.
-(snaps fingers)

31:23.256 --> 31:25.383
How'd you like to live right
for once, gentlemen?

31:26.175 --> 31:29.220
Get an address from Clay
that gives us these dealers

31:29.304 --> 31:31.264
plus sandbag him on a murder conviction.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.600
LaRue and Washington know not
to mention the Simons case?

31:33.683 --> 31:34.642
Yes.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.144
All right.

31:37.270 --> 31:42.358
The bargain is, the dealer's address
in exchange for immunity,

31:42.817 --> 31:45.194
only on the car Clay stole today.

31:45.653 --> 31:47.030
Not the murder he did last night.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.448
They understand that.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.033
Well, make damn sure, Frank.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.409
I want these dealers.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.037
I want to send a message loud and clear

31:54.120 --> 31:57.123
that no one shoots down my cops
in cold blood and gets away with it.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.793
But if I do it by trading away
a conviction on the Simons killing,

32:00.877 --> 32:02.086
they'll crucify me.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.717
Such a thing as being too smart, Louis.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.801
Not till she gets here.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.012
Amen, Louis.
You don't have to say word one.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.139
You'd just better hope
that we still need that information.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.599
Hey, what's that?

32:14.682 --> 32:16.434
Oh, look, it's Louis's deal,
heading south.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.227
I'm not saying anything without my lawyer.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.605
See, Louis you fell into it, man.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.775
The people you boosted that car
from today, they wasted some cops.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.444
Now, all you got to do
is tell us were you got it.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.738
It's not every day you can walk away
from Grand Theft Auto, Louis.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.907
And you can believe
we're not waiting on you, Louis.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.951
You can believe that
we're out looking for these guys.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.202
You'd better hope we don't find 'em.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.120
Look, I'm not saying I don't want a deal.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.039
-J.D.: Tick-tock, Louis.
-Will you just wait?

32:38.122 --> 32:39.707
Will you just let me think a minute.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.917
Oh, take all the time you need.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.002
As long as you don't
outsmart yourself, Louis.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.969
Leo, could you get Louis Clay
out of holding, please?

32:51.052 --> 32:52.887
I think he's already in Interrogation A.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.767
-FAY: Please, listen to me.
-Where is he? Were is Louis Clay?

32:57.850 --> 32:59.686
Mrs. Simons, you shouldn't have come here.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.814
Please, where is the man
who killed my husband?

33:02.897 --> 33:04.524
I want to see his face.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.651
-I just want to look into his eyes.
-Come over here.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.152
Come over here and sit with me.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.492
-Let's have it, Louis.
-Play ball.

33:14.701 --> 33:15.660
(door opens)

33:16.953 --> 33:19.872
End of discussion, gentlemen.
Mr. Clay, I'm your attorney.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.082
Where were you, lady?

33:21.374 --> 33:24.627
Hey, no thumbscrews, Ms. Davenport.
We were just having a talk with Louis.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.296
I have to talk to the men outside
about your case, Mr. Clay.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.424
You keep your mouth shut until I get back.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.801
-That's what I've been doing.
-Yeah, he's great at that.

33:34.637 --> 33:38.933
Joyce, nobody's going behind your back.
Clay had information we needed.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.560
He has leverage on that car he stole

33:40.643 --> 33:42.770
only as long as that information
is current.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.647
My detectives wanna make sure
he understood that.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.900
Has my client been charged in
all the crimes in which he's a suspect?

33:47.984 --> 33:50.069
Figure we're trying to get him
on the Jimmy Hoffa killing?

33:52.572 --> 33:54.824
How about the killing of Booker Simons?

33:56.075 --> 33:57.118
Son of a--

33:57.994 --> 33:59.579
You've got a leak in your boat, Captain.

33:59.662 --> 34:01.122
If time is so precious, gentlemen,

34:01.205 --> 34:03.291
let's stop shooting each other
through the grease.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.084
Any bargain has to be comprehensive.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.378
We give up Clay in exchange
for a street number,

34:07.462 --> 34:08.838
this community is gonna run riot.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.256
I have to have that address.

34:10.631 --> 34:11.507
What do I hear?

34:11.883 --> 34:15.053
How about if Clay gets immunity
on the crime he did today

34:15.136 --> 34:16.679
and if he gets charged
in the Simons killing,

34:16.763 --> 34:18.431
the maximum will be
voluntary manslaughter.

34:18.806 --> 34:19.640
How much time?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.184
FRANK: No, no, no,
the deal's on the charge.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.894
Jury'll have to determine the sentence.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.980
That's as good as it's gonna get,
Ms. Davenport.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.441
As it is, I'm gonna need
a place to fall on this.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.738
I want you to find that leak, Captain.
I want it fixed.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.202
I need a couple of minutes
to lay it out for Clay.

34:39.285 --> 34:40.203
No more than that.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.335
(toilet flushing)

34:48.669 --> 34:49.754
-Henry.
-Frank.

34:55.885 --> 34:56.719
What's up?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.807
Boy, I tell you, it's like something
out of<i> Police Gazette.</i>

35:01.974 --> 35:04.143
We set out bait cars,
trying to get Louis Clay,

35:04.227 --> 35:06.312
instead he snags another car,
which just happens to have

35:06.395 --> 35:08.856
about a zillion dollars' worth
of smack hidden in the door.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.192
-Street value.
-Suddenly, out of nowhere,

35:11.526 --> 35:13.986
I have the biggest drug epidemic
I've ever seen

35:14.070 --> 35:15.822
married to the Reverend Simons
murder case.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.907
Wait a second, five minutes ago,
Fletcher Daniels

35:17.990 --> 35:19.784
was turning cartwheels
about this wedding. What happened?

35:19.867 --> 35:22.703
Well, what happened was that J.D. or Neal
must've shot his mouth off

35:22.787 --> 35:24.580
about Clay being a suspect
in the Simons murder

35:24.664 --> 35:27.458
because Joyce just got a hold of it
and took us to the cleaners.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.001
Frank?

35:30.878 --> 35:32.964
I wouldn't come down
too hard on Neal or J.D.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.966
I'm not sure what you do with it, but I--

35:35.299 --> 35:37.343
I know Fay had Clay's name earlier today.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.220
She asked me if he was connected
to the Simons shooting.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.763
-And you told her?
-No, I didn't.

35:41.722 --> 35:44.392
But she could've put two and two together
and told Simons' wife.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.269
The woman was just outside raising hell.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.485
Should we have him sign anything?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.362
Give us the damned address.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.905
Not necessary, Mr. Clay.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.407
You're lucky I cased it.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.534
Greasers live on Fulmer.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.787
Between Arnold and 98th,
north side, middle of the street.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.039
-Give us an address.
-I don't know the number.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.499
I-- I can show it to you.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.127
Put him in a car.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.838
J.D.: Come on. Come on.

36:20.052 --> 36:23.097
That's him, isn't it?
That's the man who killed Booker!

36:23.181 --> 36:26.184
-Murderer! Murderer!
-J.D., J.D., let's go.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.643
Come on, take it easy.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.020
-Murderer!
-Take it easy, ma'am.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.146
(crying) Lord forgive him--

36:30.938 --> 36:33.441
Lord forgive him for what I can't!

36:33.524 --> 36:35.693
-(indistinct chatter)
-MAN: People, clear this area. Move back.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.695
-(helicopter circling)
-Come on, move back.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.238
MAN (on radio):
<i>Blue Fox One to Fox Leader.</i>

36:39.322 --> 36:41.282
<i>Third floor.</i>
<i>Request permission to examine.</i>

36:41.365 --> 36:42.909
Stand by, Blue Fox One.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.160
<i>-</i>BLUE FOX ONE:<i> All right.</i>
-We're ready, Frank.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.620
Talk to them, Howard.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.540
Frank, if they shot people down in cold
blood in that impound lot--

36:49.624 --> 36:50.458
Just do it.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.544
MAN: Anyone not on police business,
clear this area immediately.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.213
(sighs, clears throat)

36:59.008 --> 37:02.011
Residents on the fourth floor,
this is the police--

37:02.094 --> 37:03.638
(gunfire)

37:05.765 --> 37:07.642
Ballantine, prepare to deploy tear gas.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.978
Blue Fox One, move two counts
after the canisters go in.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.271
You ready, Ballantine?

37:12.355 --> 37:13.606
-Yes, sir.
-Now.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.071
-(glass breaks)
-(gunfire)

37:20.571 --> 37:21.781
Take 'em, Blue Fox One.

37:33.793 --> 37:34.710
HUNTER: Cease fire.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.840
(helicopter continues circling)

37:40.508 --> 37:41.842
All right, back-ups, move out.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.098
(indistinct chatter)

37:47.181 --> 37:49.475
(sirens approaching)

37:53.562 --> 37:56.482
(faint radio chatter)

38:18.337 --> 38:20.798
Of course you know, I ain't gonna be able
to submit the final bill

38:20.881 --> 38:22.800
until we do a complete overhaul
on all of those cars,

38:22.883 --> 38:24.302
you know, check out the wear and tear--

38:24.385 --> 38:26.512
Oh, yeah, never can tell
what kind of wear and tear

38:26.595 --> 38:28.472
being parked four hours could do.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.807
What, am I gonna get a hard time now?

38:29.890 --> 38:31.183
You gonna squeeze me on my vouchers?

38:31.267 --> 38:34.520
Rob, look, you did the department a favor.
Go ahead and goose the bill.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.564
Just don't insult their intelligence.

38:36.772 --> 38:39.442
Mr. Nelson,
we picked up three of the four cars.

38:39.525 --> 38:40.943
What do you mean, three of the four?

38:41.027 --> 38:43.571
You sure you give us the right address
on that mocha sedan?

38:43.654 --> 38:45.406
Of course I gave you the right address.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.327
-Where was it parked?
-Utica and 123, I put it there myself.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.871
Hey, J. D., I'm still covered
if that car gets boosted.

38:51.954 --> 38:54.457
You know, I think after 4:00,
that's a tow zone.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.964
AR-15, shrapnel grenades,

39:02.048 --> 39:05.092
they had enough hardware in there
to start a war, which is what they got.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.054
Captain, got word that
Officer Cooney's gonna make it.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.722
-Thanks, Stan.
-You know, I served with Cooney

39:09.805 --> 39:10.848
at Polk Avenue.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.726
Got six months left, he was gonna
loaf it out at the impound lot.

39:13.809 --> 39:14.643
Funny, huh?

39:16.354 --> 39:17.438
Was it bad out there, Lieutenant?

39:17.521 --> 39:19.607
I don't know if I suspect
that our heroin plague

39:19.690 --> 39:20.816
is over though, Sergeant.

39:21.609 --> 39:24.987
Confirmation from ballistics.
Clay's gun killed Simons.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.073
Charge him. Voluntary manslaughter.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.326
-Voluntary manslaughter?
-That's the charge, Henry.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.329
Fay, my office.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.206
What's the matter?

39:49.303 --> 39:50.846
How did the Reverend Simons' widow
find out

39:50.930 --> 39:52.390
we had a suspect on her husband's death?

39:52.807 --> 39:54.392
-Why are you asking me?
-Why do you think?

39:54.475 --> 39:56.185
Did you tell her we had a suspect, Fay?

39:56.268 --> 39:58.437
Don't shout at me! Yes.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.981
And I'm sorry she created that scene.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.070
I'm used to seeing grief.
It's part of my job.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.283
I'm not used to plea-bargaining
a murder case down to manslaughter

40:11.367 --> 40:14.120
because you decide to scratch the itch
of your good intentions.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.663
What's that supposed to mean?

40:15.746 --> 40:18.457
It means there was premature exposure
of Louis Clay

40:18.541 --> 40:20.209
as a suspect in the Simons case.

40:20.292 --> 40:22.795
It means that Louis Clay's
plea bargain might not have

40:22.878 --> 40:26.132
included the Reverend's murder
if you had kept your mouth shut!

40:27.800 --> 40:28.634
Oh, my God.

40:28.717 --> 40:32.179
You capitalized on personal relationships
to get that information, Fay,

40:32.263 --> 40:34.640
and then you behaved unprofessionally
once you had it.

40:35.015 --> 40:36.976
-Well, what do you want me to do?
-I-I don't know.

40:37.601 --> 40:38.436
You want me to quit?

40:40.271 --> 40:41.981
I want you to realize your mistake.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.316
I want you to understand
your responsibilities.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.278
I'm supposed to be
the victims' aid, Frank.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.323
And every day,
I see victims I can't aid at all.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.117
That's no excuse.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.743
I know it's no excuse.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.996
I just need you to understand,

40:57.621 --> 40:59.165
this woman called me on the phone

40:59.248 --> 41:01.542
and I could hear
the pain in her voice, I--

41:02.334 --> 41:05.212
I just wanted to offer her
some kind of consolation.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.755
I was wrong to do it.

41:07.089 --> 41:08.257
It can't happen again.

41:10.050 --> 41:11.969
If it does, you won't have to quit.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.225
Good night.

41:19.810 --> 41:20.644
Good night.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.908
Fay, Fay,
the district attorney's office called.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.452
They released Mr. Coleman's TV
from Property.

41:37.077 --> 41:40.372
Well, I'll have to call Mrs. Coleman.
Mr. Coleman's under psychiatric care.

41:40.706 --> 41:41.582
Thank you, Lieutenant.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.585
"Lieutenant"? Are you angry with me?

41:45.878 --> 41:47.755
No, I-I just think that--

41:48.339 --> 41:50.216
Here, I should call you Lieutenant.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.343
All right.

41:55.262 --> 41:56.096
He's here.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.726
Did you sort it out?

42:01.143 --> 42:02.853
-He just wouldn't listen. I tried--
-Carla.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.689
Life is what happens
while you're waiting for life to start.

42:06.148 --> 42:09.652
Every day you keep going the way you were,
makes it that much harder to walk away.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.862
I stopped. I'll never do it again.

42:19.453 --> 42:20.287
Billy?

42:21.830 --> 42:24.792
The, uh, whore said you wanted to see me.
Did she put you up to this?

42:24.875 --> 42:28.087
I'm not going to pretend this isn't
something serious in your lives, Billy.

42:28.504 --> 42:32.049
You obviously have to decide for yourself
how you feel about what happened.

42:32.424 --> 42:33.801
But however misguidedly,

42:34.009 --> 42:36.637
Carla just wanted to help
the two of you make a new start.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.556
A new start with a hooker?

42:39.348 --> 42:43.185
I'm not saying what she did was right.
But she wanted to make a life with you.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.271
She thought this was a way to it.

42:47.147 --> 42:48.190
I hope you work it out.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.707
Well,<i> deja </i>Gue.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.418
-What?
-To what do we owe this pleasure?

43:07.501 --> 43:08.752
Soliciting, Leo.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.005
Today just ain't my day.

43:12.339 --> 43:15.801
Harry, do you mind if I have a brief word
with your suspect?

43:16.343 --> 43:17.553
I don't know, Lieutenant.

43:26.645 --> 43:28.105
-Go.
-It's "Gue."

43:28.564 --> 43:29.815
"Go," as in "leave."

43:30.774 --> 43:32.985
-What about the cop who arrested me--
-I'll take care of it.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.696
-What do I have to do?
-Nothing.

43:36.739 --> 43:38.616
It's a freebie. Go on.

43:46.707 --> 43:50.085
Case materials on the Colombians.
Your bust, your paperwork...

43:50.169 --> 43:51.253
(slaps desk) ...our pen.

43:52.963 --> 43:53.964
What's the matter with you?

43:54.048 --> 43:55.883
Mother Keenan didn't raise good losers.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.802
I don't feel like a winner, Joe.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.430
Oh, sure, it's just one big department,
isn't it?

44:01.513 --> 44:02.806
"I'm only thrilled
they're off the streets."

44:02.890 --> 44:04.433
Why don't you take
your white hat off, Frank?

44:05.434 --> 44:07.269
What do you want?
What'd you come up here for?

44:09.647 --> 44:10.981
Working this case is the...

44:12.983 --> 44:15.069
first time I felt like a cop
since coming downtown.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.031
It's a different job, Joe.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.951
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

44:23.869 --> 44:25.162
Yes, sir, downtown.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.040
Downtown--
You know what downtown is, Frank?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.794
Watching Daniels play
both ends against the middle.

44:32.336 --> 44:33.629
Getting half stiff lunch.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.006
Try to be the one he lies to.

44:37.883 --> 44:38.717
No.

44:41.053 --> 44:43.472
Once you stop being a good cop,
that's when all the other stuff starts.

44:43.555 --> 44:45.140
You can't be a good cop, Frank.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.894
Cannot be a good cop, that's--
that's how you get in trouble.

44:48.977 --> 44:50.521
What stuff? What do you mean?

44:51.105 --> 44:54.191
Oh... you wouldn't understand.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.696
Glad we made the case.
You ought to get those blinds cleaned.

45:00.072 --> 45:03.909
(thunder rumbling faintly)

45:11.542 --> 45:12.376
Going home?

45:14.294 --> 45:15.504
I had to tell him, Fay.

45:15.963 --> 45:16.797
I know.

45:19.508 --> 45:20.968
I'm not angry at you, Henry.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.470
I just feel ashamed.

45:24.763 --> 45:26.598
-Tomorrow's another day.
-(sighing)

45:26.682 --> 45:28.267
I keep telling myself that.

45:29.184 --> 45:30.519
I guess I don't believe it.

45:30.602 --> 45:33.522
Come on, lift yourself up.
We make mistakes, that's how we learn.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.649
This wasn't just a mistake, Henry.

45:36.817 --> 45:39.445
And I keep thinking,
if I'd been anybody else but his ex-wife,

45:39.528 --> 45:40.696
he'd have fired me on the spot.

45:40.779 --> 45:43.198
Okay. Look, Fay, I'm not gonna tell you

45:43.282 --> 45:45.492
that personal relationships
don't matter, they do.

45:45.951 --> 45:47.661
But I also know that
Frank wouldn't keep you on

45:47.745 --> 45:49.830
if he didn't feel you were doing
a damn fine job.

45:50.706 --> 45:53.125
-Really?
-Yes. He's too good a cop.

45:56.795 --> 45:57.629
Thank you, Henry.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.049
You got time for a drink?

46:02.634 --> 46:03.469
I wish.

46:04.178 --> 46:05.596
I gotta go home and feed the kids.

46:05.679 --> 46:06.513
Okay.

46:07.890 --> 46:08.724
See you tomorrow.

46:09.641 --> 46:10.476
See you tomorrow.

46:13.687 --> 46:14.521
Lieutenant...

46:15.272 --> 46:16.565
<i>Chief of Police Fletcher Daniels</i>

46:16.648 --> 46:19.359
<i>had this reaction</i>
<i>to the controversial plea bargain.</i>

46:20.068 --> 46:23.030
<i>This afternoon, the police department</i>
<i>arrested Louis Clay</i>

46:23.113 --> 46:25.616
<i>as a suspect in the cowardly</i>
<i>and despicable murder</i>

46:25.699 --> 46:26.909
<i>of Reverend Booker Simons.</i>

46:27.367 --> 46:29.077
<i>I share the grief and frustration</i>

46:29.369 --> 46:31.288
<i>of the family and community</i>
<i>of Reverend Simons</i>

46:31.371 --> 46:35.667
<i>in today's decision to charge Mr. Clay</i>
<i>only with voluntary manslaughter</i>

46:35.751 --> 46:37.044
<i>in Reverend Simons' death.</i>

46:37.753 --> 46:39.922
<i>I find myself wondering, as they must be,</i>

46:40.464 --> 46:43.425
<i>whether rather than being</i>
<i>considered a capital crime,</i>

46:43.509 --> 46:47.971
<i>murder is to be trivialized</i>
<i>and made the occasion of barter.</i>

46:49.890 --> 46:51.058
(clicks off TV)

46:54.645 --> 46:56.146
Daniel's found his place to fall.

46:56.438 --> 46:57.272
Mm.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.108
You know when they called me
out of court this morning,

47:00.192 --> 47:02.236
my first thought was
something happened to you.

47:02.986 --> 47:04.822
(chuckles) Somehow, when I saw you,

47:04.905 --> 47:06.824
you did not have the look
of a worried wife.

47:07.616 --> 47:09.076
More like a fire-breathing dragon.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.915
By that time,
I had ascertained you were safe.

47:15.582 --> 47:17.918
Without bringing the office home, Frank,

47:18.585 --> 47:22.381
I remind you, I disapprove of my clients
being questioned in my absence.

47:22.464 --> 47:26.301
Oh, we weren't questioning,
we were just elucidating his options.

47:26.385 --> 47:30.013
(laughs) I disapprove of my clients having
their options elucidated.

47:33.559 --> 47:34.852
Consider me reminded.

47:38.856 --> 47:41.108
-Oof!
-Don't make me get rough with you, Frank.

47:41.191 --> 47:45.070
-Oh, yeah?
-(shrieks, laughing)

47:48.949 --> 47:50.951
(closing theme playing)
