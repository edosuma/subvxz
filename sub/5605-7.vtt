09:02.085 --> 09:05.119
She's an intelligent,
creative, capable woman.

09:05.121 --> 09:06.753
Just like her mother.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.954
Oh, no, no, no.

09:07.956 --> 09:09.956
You're not gonna get out of this
by complimenting me.

09:09.958 --> 09:12.191
Why? You look great
when you're all steamed up?

09:12.193 --> 09:13.025
[ Sighs ]

09:13.027 --> 09:15.027
[ Laughing ]
Stop, stop.

09:15.029 --> 09:15.961
Now, wait, hey.

09:15.963 --> 09:17.095
My point is,

09:17.097 --> 09:19.197
it is hard enough
for women to get ahead.

09:19.199 --> 09:20.431
You can't hold Kristin back

09:20.433 --> 09:22.733
just because you're her dad
and you want to protect her.

09:22.735 --> 09:23.900
If I weren't her dad,

09:23.902 --> 09:26.068
she would have been fired
maybe eight months ago.

09:26.070 --> 09:27.102
What? Why?

09:27.104 --> 09:29.437
You're always saying
she's doing a great job.

09:29.439 --> 09:30.604
Yeah, as the manager.

09:30.606 --> 09:32.639
But putting together
a restaurant's more complicated.

09:32.641 --> 09:34.607
She dropped a lot of balls
I had to pick up.

09:34.609 --> 09:37.242
Well, she didn't
tell me<i> that.</i>

09:37.244 --> 09:40.211
She didn't tell you that
'cause I never told her that.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.247
Well, since when are you so shy
about telling the truth?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.215
I mean, there's a reason
why I never ask you

09:45.217 --> 09:47.717
if I look fat
in my skinny jeans.

09:47.719 --> 09:50.953
Because you make every pair
of jeans look like skinny jeans.

09:50.955 --> 09:54.589
[ Laughing ]
Just stop.

09:54.591 --> 09:58.792
Look, all I'm saying
is you are always telling me

09:58.794 --> 10:01.094
how the kids need to learn
to take their lumps.

10:01.096 --> 10:02.161
Yeah, but in kris' case,

10:02.163 --> 10:03.929
I thought she'd taken
enough lumps.

10:03.931 --> 10:06.064
And she was just getting
her confidence back,

10:06.066 --> 10:08.166
and I didn't want to take that
away from her.

10:08.168 --> 10:10.935
You're a good dad.

10:10.937 --> 10:13.570
I know, but does that make me
a lousy boss?

10:13.572 --> 10:16.573
The thing with Mike the boss
and Mike the dad

10:16.575 --> 10:17.907
and Mike the person

10:17.909 --> 10:19.942
is he's always
talking straight to people.

10:19.944 --> 10:22.144
And then he lets them
make their own choices.

10:22.146 --> 10:24.513
Yeah, Mike's a terrific guy,
isn't he?

10:24.515 --> 10:25.447
Yeah.

10:25.449 --> 10:27.982
Is that all you got
out of that?

10:27.984 --> 10:29.249
I'll call kris.

10:29.251 --> 10:31.751
Good. Ah! Okay.

10:31.753 --> 10:33.786
You can compliment me
more now if you want.

10:33.788 --> 10:35.921
You know,
I don't like to waste it

10:35.923 --> 10:38.023
unless you're really
mad at me.

10:42.929 --> 10:44.595
Hey, check it out.

10:44.597 --> 10:45.929
Wow!

10:45.931 --> 10:49.665
Yeah. Mr. Alzate wore this suit
in his third wedding.

10:51.669 --> 10:55.804
Like my third wife,
it's beautiful and expensive.

10:55.806 --> 10:57.438
The difference is,

10:57.440 --> 11:01.007
I get to take<i> it</i>
to the cleaners.

11:01.009 --> 11:04.310
Okay, uh...

11:04.312 --> 11:05.778
Something's missing.

11:05.780 --> 11:07.646
What is it,
what is it?

11:07.648 --> 11:09.447
Oh, Kyle,
you're gonna kill me.

11:09.449 --> 11:10.448
Flowers.

11:10.450 --> 11:11.482
Oh, no worries.

11:11.484 --> 11:13.450
I love getting flowers
for other people.

11:13.452 --> 11:16.953
And I don't care that nobody
ever gets me flowers.

11:16.955 --> 11:20.022
But if they did --
hint, hint -- daffodils.

11:20.024 --> 11:20.989
Kyle, flowers.

11:20.991 --> 11:22.290
Okay.

11:22.292 --> 11:24.625
All right. I tried to make it
as romantic as possible,

11:24.627 --> 11:27.561
but it's a little hard
with all the dead animals.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.362
[ Laughs ]
You've done great.

11:29.364 --> 11:31.997
The important thing
is that I get to tell Wendi

11:31.999 --> 11:35.033
how I truly feel
and give her this.

11:35.035 --> 11:37.568
Oh! That's so...

11:37.570 --> 11:39.236
Ordinary.

11:39.238 --> 11:42.906
This is a special swan,
Mandy.

11:42.908 --> 11:45.074
Yeah, we saw it at a flea market
in new Mexico

11:45.076 --> 11:47.309
when we were
deeply in love.

11:47.311 --> 11:50.412
She admired it,
so when she wasn't looking,

11:50.414 --> 11:51.679
I bought it.

11:51.681 --> 11:53.847
I was going to give it to her
for her birthday,

11:53.849 --> 11:56.015
and then she --
she broke up with me.

11:56.017 --> 11:58.317
And tonight,
you're finally giving it to her.

11:58.319 --> 11:59.584
That's so sweet.

11:59.586 --> 12:04.088
I'm gonna smash it
right in front of her smug face.

12:04.090 --> 12:06.723
Uh...Come again?

12:06.725 --> 12:09.025
Well, she broke my heart,
so I'm gonna woo her back

12:09.027 --> 12:12.061
and break hers
like a cheap glass swan.

12:12.063 --> 12:15.564
That's terrible!
No wonder she bit you!

12:15.566 --> 12:17.566
I've been plotting this
for months.

12:17.568 --> 12:20.569
Revenge is a dish
best served cold.

12:20.571 --> 12:22.070
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

12:22.072 --> 12:24.238
I did all of this so you two
could patch things up.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.707
And I can't thank you enough,
Mandy.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.676
Listen, Ed, I have a confession
to make, okay?

12:29.678 --> 12:31.577
I am not actually
a doctor.

12:31.579 --> 12:32.611
Oh.

12:32.613 --> 12:33.878
But I do know love,

12:33.880 --> 12:36.413
and I can see
that you still love Wendi.

12:36.415 --> 12:38.515
It's -- it's just
an Ember now,

12:38.517 --> 12:41.451
but if you fan it,
you can turn it into a flame.

12:41.453 --> 12:42.685
Well, your work
is done now, Mandy.

12:42.687 --> 12:43.952
I'll take it from here.

12:43.954 --> 12:45.920
I'm not gonna let this happen.
I'm gonna tell her.

12:45.922 --> 12:48.389
That's very brave of you,
knowing I spend months

12:48.391 --> 12:50.791

against people who wrong me.

12:54.262 --> 12:56.695
Hello, Eddie.

12:56.697 --> 12:58.029
Hi, Wendi.

12:58.031 --> 12:59.897
Come in, please.

12:59.899 --> 13:02.566
Everything looks
so beautiful.

13:02.568 --> 13:04.067
Well, thanks to Mandy.

we have the perfect evening.

13:07.472 --> 13:08.838
Don't you, Mandy?

13:12.109 --> 13:13.408
Yes.

13:13.410 --> 13:17.478
But if one of the dishes
is cold, it's not my fault.

13:29.224 --> 13:30.990
What the hell
are you doing?

13:30.992 --> 13:34.259
Oh, I'm making a bouquet
for Mr. Alzate to give to Wendi.

I'm trying to pick flowers
that say "take me back."

13:37.230 --> 13:39.630
You know what these flowers
are saying right now?

13:39.632 --> 13:41.331
"Put me back
or you're fired."

Hey, kris,
can I talk to you for a minute?

13:45.736 --> 13:47.469

Mr. Baxter.

13:47.471 --> 13:48.803
But, uh, I think "kris"

13:48.805 --> 13:50.738
is a little familiar
for the workplace.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.773
From now on, I would prefer
"Mrs. Vogelson."

13:52.775 --> 13:55.575
Yeah. It's smart to pick
the name they call you at work.

13:55.577 --> 13:58.144
If you leave it up to them,
you will not be happy.

13:58.146 --> 14:01.847
We are having a conversation,
bonehead.

14:01.849 --> 14:04.950
[ Chuckles ]
I picked that one.

14:04.952 --> 14:09.287
I found the others to be,
uh, a bit pejorative.

14:09.289 --> 14:10.921
Listen, I know it's hard
to separate

14:10.923 --> 14:13.123
your role as my boss
from your role as my father,

14:13.125 --> 14:14.824
so I'm just trying
to make it easier.

14:14.826 --> 14:16.525
All right, kid,
I understand what you're doing,

14:16.527 --> 14:18.693
but can you go with something
else besides "Mrs. Vogelson"?

14:18.695 --> 14:21.028
That sounds like
bad fish sticks.

14:21.030 --> 14:22.329
The important thing is,

14:22.331 --> 14:25.031
from now on at work,
I am no longer your daughter.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.032
Okay. Got it.

14:26.034 --> 14:28.367
But right now
I want to put my dad hat on.

14:28.369 --> 14:30.268
You're the boss,
Mr. Baxter.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.603
Not Mr. Baxter.
I'm your dad right now.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.138
And as your dad,
I do want to encourage you

14:35.140 --> 14:37.106
to push yourself,
to take risks.

14:37.108 --> 14:40.142
So if you really think
you can do this job in Dallas,

14:40.144 --> 14:41.343

that's fantastic!

14:46.782 --> 14:47.881
Oh, no. No hugs.

my boss hat on.

I have got it turned around
to look younger.

14:54.021 --> 14:56.287
And as your boss,
I want to let you know

14:56.289 --> 14:58.389
that when you set up
this restaurant,

14:58.391 --> 15:01.058
you made some mistakes
that I had to cover for.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.993
I never heard about that.

15:02.995 --> 15:05.328
That's generally what they mean
by "covered for."

15:05.330 --> 15:07.363
Kristin, you missed
a bunch of deadlines.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.898
You didn't return calls.
You pissed off the inspectors.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.199
They pissed me off.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.335
Right, they piss everybody off.
They're inspectors.

how I handle them?

15:16.639 --> 15:17.871
I'm nice.

it is for me to be nice?

why don't you just tell me.

to be nice.

it is for me to be nice?

that I'm going to make

15:35.054 --> 15:36.987
the same mistakes
in Dallas?

on purpose.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.683
Look, we broke
a wine glass.

17:53.685 --> 17:55.484
Aw! I'm sorry.
I thought --

17:55.486 --> 17:58.687
wait, look.
Look what Eddie got me.

17:58.689 --> 18:01.022
[ Gasps ]
That's so...Beautiful.

18:01.024 --> 18:02.656
I know.

18:02.658 --> 18:05.492
Look, a lady
in a bathing suit.

18:05.494 --> 18:07.427
Oh. I'm sorry, ma'am.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.166
[ Knock on door ]
Come on in.

18:15.168 --> 18:17.635
Okay. That's great.
Thanks.

18:17.637 --> 18:19.169
Can I talk to you
for a second?

18:19.171 --> 18:21.304
Sure.
Which hat are you wearing?

18:21.306 --> 18:23.639
The daughter hat
or the employee hat?

18:23.641 --> 18:26.108
I am wearing
my daughter<i> shoes.</i>

18:26.110 --> 18:28.443
I don't look so good
in hats.

18:28.445 --> 18:30.278
I always have time
for my kid.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.380
Just take an hour
off your time card.

18:32.382 --> 18:34.648
I was all set to tell you
how unfair it was

18:34.650 --> 18:37.550
that you hid my screw-ups
when we were opening the grill.

18:37.552 --> 18:41.453
But I realized that anybody else
would have been fired.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.689
So here's
my resignation letter.

18:44.691 --> 18:48.459
Are you resigning as my daughter
or my restaurant manager,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.828
'cause I'm getting
very confused.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.663
You gave me the shot
and you helped me out

18:52.665 --> 18:54.531
'cause you're my dad,
and I love you for it.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.633
But from now on,
I want to succeed

18:56.635 --> 18:57.967
because I've earned it.

18:57.969 --> 18:59.802
You don't have to do this.
You're doing a great job.

18:59.804 --> 19:00.903
I don't want this.

19:00.905 --> 19:03.171
Yeah, I know.
You're gonna need to take it.

19:03.173 --> 19:05.473
'Cause I'm putting on
my business shoes now.

19:05.475 --> 19:08.042
I would like to submit
my résumé

19:08.044 --> 19:10.144
for the newly vacated
manager's job

19:10.146 --> 19:11.879
you have here
at the grill.

19:11.881 --> 19:15.749
Look at that.
It's a real résumé.

19:15.751 --> 19:18.585
You really like your symbolism,
don't you?

19:18.587 --> 19:22.155
I think you will find
that I am more than qualified.

19:22.157 --> 19:25.691
And I'm sure my old boss
would give a recommendation.

19:25.693 --> 19:28.226
The guy loves
to hear himself talk.

19:28.228 --> 19:31.928
Does this mean your new boss
can still hug you

19:31.930 --> 19:33.729
when the night's over?

19:33.731 --> 19:36.264
Ooh, as long as he does it
with the other employees.

19:36.266 --> 19:39.200
I think that'll make Kyle
very happy.

19:39.202 --> 19:41.168
Welcome back.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.169
Okay.

19:42.171 --> 19:43.537
Hey, but, dad,
I want you to know

19:43.539 --> 19:46.506
that the next grill that opens,
I'm gonna want a shot.

19:46.508 --> 19:47.773
If you think I'm ready.

19:47.775 --> 19:49.574
I think Dallas
is just the beginning.

19:49.576 --> 19:51.442
I think there's
a lot of cities out there

19:51.444 --> 19:53.076
just clamoring
for weird meat.

19:54.579 --> 19:55.778
Ed: Mikey.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.913
I want you to be
the first to know.

19:57.915 --> 20:00.081
Wendi and I
are back together again.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.850
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me, Mike.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.718
Joke's on you.

20:05.720 --> 20:09.121
I was just about to poke out
my own eyes.

20:16.631 --> 20:19.064
<i> Mike Baxter here</i>
<i> for outdoor man.</i>

20:19.066 --> 20:20.799
<i> Not him -- me.</i>

20:20.801 --> 20:22.867
<i> You know,</i>
<i> when George Mallory was asked</i>

20:22.869 --> 20:24.768
<i> why he wanted to climb</i>
<i> mount Everest,</i>

20:24.770 --> 20:27.370
<i> he said, "because it's there."</i>

20:27.372 --> 20:29.271
<i> And the reporter</i>
<i> must have said,</i>

20:29.273 --> 20:33.908
<i> "thank you, sir, but I-I have</i>
<i> a whole column to fill."</i>

20:33.910 --> 20:36.243
<i> Whether it's a mountain</i>
<i> or outer space</i>

20:36.245 --> 20:37.777
<i> or a job promotion,</i>

20:37.779 --> 20:40.613
<i> our human spirit has always</i>
<i> pushed us towards greatness.</i>

20:40.615 --> 20:43.382
<i> It's why we have air travel,</i>
<i> the Internet,</i>

20:43.384 --> 20:46.752
<i> and in Cawker, Kansas,</i>
<i> an 18,000-pound ball of twine.</i>

20:46.754 --> 20:48.920
<i> [ Chuckles ]</i>
<i> Take that, China.</i>

20:48.922 --> 20:50.154
<i> Wow.</i>

20:50.156 --> 20:52.556
<i> We want to teach our kids</i>
<i> to go for it,</i>

20:52.558 --> 20:54.891
<i> but too much ambition</i>
<i> can be dangerous.</i>

20:54.893 --> 20:56.893
<i> Just ask</i>
<i> George Mallory's widow.</i>

20:56.895 --> 20:58.794
<i> The tough balance</i>
<i> for any parent</i>

20:58.796 --> 21:01.329
<i> is providing a harness</i>
<i> to keep our kids safe</i>

21:01.331 --> 21:03.831
<i> without taking away</i>
<i> the victory of the climb.</i>

21:03.833 --> 21:05.332
<i> Now, all we can do as parents</i>

21:05.334 --> 21:08.268
<i>is give them enough information</i>
<i> to make smart decisions</i>

21:08.270 --> 21:10.403
<i> and outfit them</i>
<i> in the same equipment</i>

21:10.405 --> 21:13.572
<i> that this handsome stud uses.</i>

21:13.574 --> 21:16.274
<i> "Mike Baxter: Rogue Nation".</i>

21:16.276 --> 21:20.443
<i> Like Tom Cruise,</i>
<i> I do all my own stunts.</i>

21:20.445 --> 21:22.011
<i> I use outdoor man</i>
<i> climbing gear.</i>

21:22.013 --> 21:23.979
<i> Works for me,</i>
<i> it'll work for your family.</i>

21:23.981 --> 21:25.647
<i> If it doesn't, we also sell</i>

21:25.649 --> 21:28.016
<i> some pretty amazing</i>
<i> first aid kits.</i>
