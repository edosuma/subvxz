[instrumental music]

00:10.010 --> 00:11.011
[Laura groaning]

00:11.098 --> 00:14.014
[Laura breathing heavily]

00:15.624 --> 00:17.800
[indistinct chatter]

00:17.887 --> 00:19.932
- [grunts]
- [doctor] Laura. Laura.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.238
- Yeah.
- We're almost there, okay?

00:21.282 --> 00:22.587
- We're gonna get her out, okay?
- Uh-huh.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.241
- Oh, yes!
- [doctor] Okay? Just breathe.

00:24.328 --> 00:25.938
Just breathe, Laura. Come on.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.115
- [grunting] Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Okay, honey.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.030
- Okay. You're okay.
- [doctor] Laura. Laura.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
I need you to push like
we practiced, chin to chest.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.598
Okay, ready?
You're gonna push.

00:33.642 --> 00:34.860
- All right, keep pushing.
- You can do it.

00:34.947 --> 00:36.949
- You can do it.
- [groaning]

00:37.037 --> 00:38.777
- One more big push, Laura.
- Okay. Okay.

00:38.821 --> 00:39.952
- One more big push.
- Squeeze, squeeze.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.738
Give me one more. Ready?
Go, Laura.

00:42.825 --> 00:45.393
- [grunting]
- [baby bawling]

00:45.480 --> 00:46.872
She's here. She's here.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.311
Oh, honey. Breathe.
It's done. It's done.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.573
Breathe.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.881
Oh. She's perfect.

00:55.968 --> 00:58.275
She has ten fingers
and ten toes. Just rest.

00:58.319 --> 00:59.668
- Where is my baby?
- No, no, no. Rest.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.322
- You need your strength.
- Where is my baby?

01:01.365 --> 01:02.845
- Where-where's my baby?
- No, no, no. It's time to rest.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.673
- Where's my baby? Lemme see her!
- You need your strength.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.631
- No. Shh. Honey, time to rest.
- Where is she?

01:06.718 --> 01:07.893
- You need to sleep.
- My baby...

01:07.937 --> 01:09.373
Where is she? Give her to me!

01:19.557 --> 01:22.430
[instrumental music]

01:46.280 --> 01:49.587
[Michael] Ah. Why did you
let me eat that last piece?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.502
So who's, who's ready
for dessert? Anyone?

01:51.589 --> 01:52.895
- Okay. Okay.
- Ugh.

01:52.982 --> 01:56.290
This is why
Americans are so overweight.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.683
We don't need dessert
every night, dad.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.555
Yes, we do, every night,
daughter.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.687
- No, we don't.
- [Michael] I love dessert.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.168
- Well, then, by all means.
- [Michael chuckles]

02:05.255 --> 02:08.170
In Europe, they eat their
dessert with their breakfasts.

02:08.258 --> 02:11.000
So that way they have all day
to burn off the calories.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.654
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.003
- That makes sense. Hm.
- [Skylar] Mm.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.223
That is a very impressive fact.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.486
- It is. Thank you.
- [doorbell rings]

02:19.965 --> 02:21.837
You guys expecting anyone?

02:21.880 --> 02:24.448
[Michael] Um, nope.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.146
All right. I'll be right back.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.322
But you know, here, when
we grow up, we clean our plates,

02:28.409 --> 02:30.280
so we have to do the dishes.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.684
- Hello. Can I help you?
- [whispers] Hi.

02:42.771 --> 02:46.731
Uh, I...
I'm looking for the Andersons.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.343
Sorry, not us.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.694
I must have the wrong house.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.740
Wait. We-we know most
of the families on the block.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.525
There are no Andersons.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.703
I must have
the wrong neighborhood.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.661
Um, sorry to bother you.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.708
Okay.

03:09.798 --> 03:13.236
[Michael] So, yeah, tell me.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.760
Okay, if-if you, if you do that,

03:15.847 --> 03:17.501
than mom should be
really, really happy

03:17.588 --> 03:20.461
and we gotta make mommy happy.
Mm.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.158
[Laura] That was weird.

03:22.245 --> 03:25.030
- What? Who was that?
- I don't know.

03:25.117 --> 03:27.337
It was a strange girl
at the door

03:27.424 --> 03:29.557
looking for the Andersons.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.603
But I had the feeling she was
making stuff up on the spot.

03:32.690 --> 03:36.303
- It's probably nothing.
- It's like that one scary movie.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.957
Maybe she's gonna come back
with all her friends in masks

03:39.044 --> 03:40.959
and kill us all.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.832
[gasps] You watch
too many movies.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.747
- Don't scare your mom.
- [Laura] I'm fine.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.010
- Oh.
- I'm gonna get ice cream.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.491
[clears throat]

03:50.578 --> 03:51.927
- I don't know where it goes.
- It's unbelievable.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.407
- Do you want ice cream?
- I know. [chuckles]

04:02.720 --> 04:05.114
[both sighing]

04:08.857 --> 04:09.858
Hey.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.035
What's the matter?

04:13.122 --> 04:14.079
Nothing.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.255
Nothing?

04:19.171 --> 04:21.957
Well, your face is telling
a different tale, darling.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.959
What could possibly
be the matter?

04:25.656 --> 04:28.050
[laughs] I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.314
Are you happy?

04:31.358 --> 04:33.447
You know, just, like,
with everything,

04:33.534 --> 04:37.929
like, with [inhales sharply]
our life and our family?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.804
[chuckles] What?

04:44.893 --> 04:47.156
I couldn't be happier.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.898
- Yeah. Are you?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

04:51.508 --> 04:53.380
It's just, you,
do you ever get the feeling

04:53.467 --> 04:55.164
that when things are going
really, really well,

04:55.207 --> 04:56.774
you get this feeling

04:56.861 --> 05:00.822
that something awful
is gonna happen?

05:00.909 --> 05:02.998
You know, like the other shoe's
bound to drop.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.174
No. I don't.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.265
When things are going
really well,

05:09.352 --> 05:12.355
like they are right now...

05:12.442 --> 05:15.445
I count my blessings

05:15.532 --> 05:17.534
and I enjoy them.

05:17.621 --> 05:18.840
Yeah.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.627
We're allowed to be happy.

05:23.714 --> 05:27.239
You are allowed to be happy.
You know that.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
- So stop.
- You stop. You stop it.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.509
[mellow music]

05:53.527 --> 05:55.050
[doorbell rings]

06:08.063 --> 06:10.282
Ah. It's the girl
from last night.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.372
Well, we are still
not the Andersons.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.199
Uh, to be honest,

06:14.286 --> 06:16.767
I wasn't really looking
for the Andersons.

06:16.854 --> 06:17.812
[Laura] Mm.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.685
I was looking for you.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.775
You are Mrs. Laura Parker,

06:24.862 --> 06:26.386
formerly Laura Bishop?

06:28.649 --> 06:30.694
I think you better tell me
who you are.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.529
I'm your daughter.

06:45.970 --> 06:49.800
I, uh, I don't usually drink
during the day.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.281
Well, or ever.

06:52.368 --> 06:55.502
But, um, but today...

06:55.589 --> 06:56.981
Uh, don't worry.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.680
I understand how much
of a shock this must be.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.291
I mean, I've had time
to prepare for this.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.772
I just, um...

07:06.513 --> 07:07.775
I don't...

07:09.341 --> 07:11.213
I don't know where to start.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.607
It's Bree?

07:15.173 --> 07:16.610
It's a beautiful name.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.440
And you, um...

07:20.527 --> 07:22.093
you're good?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.095
Yes, I'm good.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.270
[Laura sniffles]

07:27.969 --> 07:30.493
Well, before you, uh, before you
tell me all about yourself,

07:30.580 --> 07:34.105
um... how did you find me?

07:34.192 --> 07:35.672
Because they told me
that those records were sealed

07:35.716 --> 07:38.675
to all parties involved.
That's just, um...

07:38.762 --> 07:40.503
You know, that's just
how they did it back then.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.637
So I'm guessing you never heard
of Lighthouse Of The Lost?

07:45.073 --> 07:47.031
Well, it's a group.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.207
An organization, really.

07:49.251 --> 07:51.340
They believe that
adopted children have the right

07:51.427 --> 07:53.603
to know the truth
about their biological parents,

07:53.690 --> 07:56.432
no matter what
the previous agreement was.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.566
They helped me find you.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.830
I hope you're okay with this.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.919
A-again,
I know it's a big shock.

08:05.006 --> 08:08.836
No... I mean, yeah.
You know, of course.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.406
Look, I know
you're not gonna believe me,

08:14.450 --> 08:17.235
but there isn't a single day
that went by

08:17.279 --> 08:20.195
that I didn't think of you.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.197
I was 17...

08:22.240 --> 08:25.330
And you know the story.
I was young, I was stupid.

08:25.417 --> 08:27.724
I didn't know what I was doing.

08:27.811 --> 08:31.249
And, uh, and my parents, well...

08:31.336 --> 08:33.643
[scoffs]

08:33.730 --> 08:37.038
Well, for me, abortion just was
not an option I would consider.

08:38.866 --> 08:42.826
And so I did what...
[sniffles]

08:42.913 --> 08:46.482
We did what we thought
was best... for you.

08:50.225 --> 08:54.098
And your adopted family,
are they, are they...

08:54.142 --> 08:57.058
I was one of the lucky ones.
Uh, the Hogans.

08:57.145 --> 09:00.148
They're everything
you could want in a mom and dad.

09:00.235 --> 09:03.238
They had a biological daughter,
my sister,

09:03.281 --> 09:05.501
before they adopted me.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.938
Um, they wanted to have
more kids,

09:08.025 --> 09:11.072
but my mom couldn't conceive,
so they decided to adopt.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.074
- Voila.
- Hah. [sighs]

09:17.861 --> 09:20.124
So you have a family.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.561
Yeah, I do. I have a family.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.564
Uh, I have a husband.
His name's Michael.

09:24.651 --> 09:28.524
And I have a daughter
named Skylar.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.875
So I have a sister.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.705
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you do.

09:38.621 --> 09:39.666
[sighs]

09:39.753 --> 09:42.451
- So what now?
- Um...

09:44.322 --> 09:46.150
Well, I'd like you
to meet everybody.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.326
Only if you want.
I don't wanna...

09:48.413 --> 09:50.372
- No, I-I'd like that.
- I just...

09:50.459 --> 09:51.939
- Thank you.
- Great.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.768
Great.

09:54.811 --> 09:58.380
I should actually be going.
So...

09:58.467 --> 10:02.384
Oh. Okay. Okay.
Um...

10:05.561 --> 10:10.044
Bree, what I said before...

10:10.131 --> 10:13.917
you know, about we thought
adoption was the best option...

10:15.266 --> 10:18.618
well, we didn't.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.622
My parents did that
without my consent.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.714
And I never forgave them
for that.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.108
I am so sorry.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.936
Can I hug you?

10:34.416 --> 10:36.810
- Yes.
- [sobbing] Yeah? Oh.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.944
Oh.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.657
[Gareth] We're getting lot of
traffic out of Prague, Croatia,

10:57.744 --> 11:00.660
the Yukon territories
in Canada, Tasmania.

11:00.747 --> 11:01.835
I mean, I don't think
that's ever happened

11:01.922 --> 11:03.837
for a tech company before.

11:03.924 --> 11:06.100
Anyway, we're getting
75 percent activation

11:06.187 --> 11:08.798
from users with this
free upgrade, which is great.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.539
Well above
the normal adoption rate,

11:10.626 --> 11:12.802
but a little less
than we anticipated.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.022
I had Andrea
run the analytics again.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.328
Uh, I'm trying to get
a macro view of the situation.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.852
Really, like,
get in there and see

11:18.939 --> 11:22.377
what's bugging people out.

11:22.464 --> 11:25.467
Boss. Boss, you listening?

11:28.557 --> 11:30.428
Uh, of course. Of course.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.126
You're gonna run analytics.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.824
I already had Andrea run them
a second time.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.481
- [chuckles] Right.
- Yeah.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.918
- [Michael] Right.
- What's going on?

11:42.005 --> 11:43.703
What, did you and some
of the other bigwigs go for one

11:43.790 --> 11:46.270
of those
three-martini luncheons?

11:46.357 --> 11:49.491
- Yeah, I wish. I...
- [cell phone vibrating]

11:49.578 --> 11:52.276
Uh, let me, let me grab this.

11:52.363 --> 11:56.193
Hey. Uh, sort of. Why?

12:01.372 --> 12:03.635
You're kidding me.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.072
Okay, 15 minutes.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.248
- No. Michael, that's...
- Hold on.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.511
That is the wrong way.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.689
[Holmes] Unfortunately,
we have some bad news

12:13.776 --> 12:15.125
and there's no easy way
to say it,

12:15.212 --> 12:17.171
so I'll just get right to it.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.913
Your parents
were in an accident.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.263
Look, I don't mean to sound
insensitive, detectives,

12:22.350 --> 12:24.874
I don't, but I haven't seen
or spoken to my parents

12:24.961 --> 12:27.703
in... 20 years.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.271
We had a...

12:32.534 --> 12:34.449
Well, we had a falling out.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.454
I-I'm sorry.
But why is this a police matter?

12:39.541 --> 12:41.151
Carbon-monoxide poisoning.

12:41.195 --> 12:45.677
It's, uh, it's-it's a tragedy,
but I...

12:45.721 --> 12:48.506
You're right. Uh, typically,
something like this is not.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.944
But with older couples
in older homes,

12:51.031 --> 12:53.076
it happens a lot more
than you might think.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.339
But...

12:55.426 --> 12:56.514
But the piping connected

12:56.558 --> 12:59.300
to the furnace was compromised.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.692
Well, can't that happen from age

13:00.780 --> 13:03.347
or normal wear and tear
or something?

13:03.434 --> 13:04.958
It can. For sure it can.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.351
Uh, but the fire inspector said,

13:07.395 --> 13:11.138
well, um,
he said it was fifty-fifty.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.792
Fifty-fifty what?

13:14.358 --> 13:16.447
Fifty-fifty
that it was done intentionally.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.191
So you might not have seen them
in years,

13:21.235 --> 13:23.977
but do you have any idea
if they had any enemies,

13:24.020 --> 13:26.327
anyone who'd wanna do them harm?

13:28.024 --> 13:31.593
When I was a kid,
we went to First Methodist.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.943
They were very, very active
in that church.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.382
- You could start there, I guess.
- We tried.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.689
Uh, we talked
to some of the parishioners.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.082
Everyone we spoke to
said your folks

13:42.169 --> 13:43.692
was just a lovely couple.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.609
Couldn't imagine anyone
wanting to hurt 'em.

13:47.696 --> 13:48.828
Right.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.658
Well, um...

13:53.745 --> 13:57.184
Yeah, I don't know
how else we can help you.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.360
I don't know either, ma'am.
I'm-I'm sorry to say.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.406
But if you do think of anything,

14:02.450 --> 14:04.452
anything that could
possibly help us...

14:05.453 --> 14:07.194
here's my card.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.065
Thank you.

14:09.152 --> 14:13.591
Uh, you know, the more I think
about it, the more I'm convinced

14:13.635 --> 14:15.898
it was probably
just a terrible accident.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.465
Again, sorry for your loss.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.945
- Well, thank you, detectives.
- Thank you.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.121
[Michael] Let me
show you guys out.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.215
So if there's anything else
you guys need

14:28.302 --> 14:30.565
I can help you with,
just let me know, okay?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.567
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:32.610 --> 14:33.742
All right.

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754
[exhales sharply]

14:54.502 --> 14:56.896
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.595
It's okay to be sad.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.553
You know,
they were your parents.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.382
You didn't know 'em.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.039
God! [chuckles]

15:10.126 --> 15:13.434
You know, this is,
this is just like them.

15:15.131 --> 15:16.567
I mean, even in death,
they figured out a way

15:16.654 --> 15:19.135
to ruin it for me.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.485
I just get reunited

15:21.529 --> 15:24.184
with the daughter
that they took away from me.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.403
And now this.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.666
It's just...

15:28.753 --> 15:30.930
it never stops, you know?

15:33.367 --> 15:36.196
- [Skylar] Uh... Okay, well...
- Don't be nervous.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.762
What am I supposed
to say to her?

15:37.849 --> 15:40.504
Whatever you want.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.072
Just say what comes natural,
darling. She's gonna love you.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.292
She's gonna be nervous, too.
Okay?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.076
So it's our job

15:47.163 --> 15:50.427
to just
make her feel comfortable.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.822
I still can't believe
you never told me about her.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.824
Baby, it's not a conversation

15:55.911 --> 15:58.696
that you're super eager to have
with your teenage daughter.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.785
And besides, before this,
there has never been a reason

16:00.872 --> 16:03.397
to tell you.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.051
[whispers] Okay.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.400
[Laura] Yeah.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.229
I just, I don't get why

16:09.272 --> 16:12.145
she wants to meet us
if she has her own family.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.016
Well, think about it, honey.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.018
If you were adopted,

16:16.105 --> 16:18.716
wouldn't you be curious?

16:18.803 --> 16:22.198
And we're so awesome
as a family.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.331
- Yeah. Kinda.
- [Michael] Kinda?

16:24.418 --> 16:25.375
- You look beautiful.
- [doorbell rings]

16:25.462 --> 16:27.334
Oh. Speaking of awesome...

16:29.336 --> 16:30.902
- I'm so excited...
- Dad, it's so embarrassing.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.513
- What? No. Come on.
- It's so embarrassing.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.036
- You're gonna meet your sister.
- You make me feel bad.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.429
- Do I look fine?
- You look great.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.170
- Is this fine? Okay.
- Let's go. Come on.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.475
- Come on.
- Fine, fine.

16:41.478 --> 16:44.351
[instrumental music]

16:53.099 --> 16:55.318
It's all, like, really, like,
strange, but different, like...

16:55.405 --> 16:57.233
Yeah, exactly.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.018
Bree, this is, uh,
this is my husband Michael.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.802
- Hi. So nice to meet you, Bree.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

17:00.889 --> 17:01.846
Thanks for coming here.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.544
And this is our daughter Skylar.

17:03.631 --> 17:04.762
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.155
Guys, this is Bree.
[chuckles]

17:06.242 --> 17:08.940
All right. Yeah.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.768
Bree, sorry.
Uh, please, come in.

17:10.811 --> 17:12.117
- Let's-let's sit down.
- Yeah. Yeah, let's come here.

17:12.204 --> 17:13.597
Come on. Yeah.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.425
Um, do you, do you want
a glass of iced tea or...

17:15.512 --> 17:16.686
- I'm okay, but thanks.
- There it goes.

17:16.773 --> 17:18.733
- Sit down.
- Make yourself at home.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.430
- That out of the way.
- All right.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.563
S-Sky, right there.

17:27.307 --> 17:31.093
So, Bree, um, did you grow up
in Highland Park?

17:31.180 --> 17:34.270
I did. Proud graduate
of Memorial High School.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.098
Where is that?
I've never heard of it.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.406
Oh, it's about half an hour
from here.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.236
Well, Skylar is a senior
in high school.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.368
She's on
the National Honor Society,

17:45.455 --> 17:47.283
the yearbook committee.

17:47.327 --> 17:48.763
- Mom.
- What?

17:48.806 --> 17:51.287
Sky, we're proud of you.
You worked so hard.

17:51.374 --> 17:54.029
- Very smart.
- [Laura] Yeah.

17:54.116 --> 17:58.120
So were you totally freaked when
your mom told you about this?

17:58.164 --> 18:00.992
You know, about me?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.082
Yeah, I don't blame you.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.649
I mean, I knew I had to have
a mom out there somewhere,

18:05.693 --> 18:10.132
but, you know, actually,
getting the information,

18:10.219 --> 18:13.614
it was... just nuts.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.623
Uh, Bree, I hope you're planning
on staying for dinner, please.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.320
Oh, come on, you have to.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.148
I wasn't really thinking
about that.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.280
Please.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.110
Then I guess I am.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.720
Great. Settled.

18:32.807 --> 18:36.506
All right.
I'm just gonna order the pizza.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.465
[Laura] Thank you, honey.
[Michael] All right.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.991
- I like your nails.
- Hm. Thanks.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.257
Do you have any polish
or nail stuff in your room?

18:48.344 --> 18:49.693
Yeah.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.261
I can teach you how if you want.

18:52.348 --> 18:53.871
Really?

18:53.958 --> 18:55.438
I mean, if that's okay with you.

18:55.525 --> 18:59.225
Yeah! That's great.
Absolutely. I mean...

18:59.312 --> 19:00.835
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.011
- Yeah, let's go.
- [Bree] Great.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.158
[Bree] So do you have
a boyfriend?

19:20.681 --> 19:22.335
[Skylar] It's complicated.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.164
Isn't it always?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.862
It's nothing, really.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.518
Relationships are hard.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.042
Trust me, I know.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.353
I don't know, I just thought
that maybe it gets better

19:40.440 --> 19:43.660
when you get older,
that guys could change.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.489
Guys change, all right.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.535
I wouldn't say
it's necessarily for the better.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.884
[chuckles]

19:52.278 --> 19:54.105
- Does your mom know?
- About what?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.585
The guy.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.458
Oh. My parents are clueless.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.373
All parents are clueless.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.463
But yours seem really great.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.073
I guess.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.082
I always wanted a sister.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.086
I thought you said
you had a sister.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.916
I do.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.571
But, you know... by blood.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.924
[knocking on door]

20:29.967 --> 20:32.187
Pizza's here, girls.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.971
Well, come on.
Let's get it while it's hot.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.103
- [chuckles]
- Let's go.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.409
All right.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.151
- Mm!
- We have a whole other pizza.

20:40.195 --> 20:43.198
- So there's no shortage.
- Yes. [clears throat]

20:43.285 --> 20:45.809
So, Bree, um,

20:45.853 --> 20:48.290
what do your parents think
about you meeting us?

20:48.377 --> 20:51.641
I mean, assuming that you told
'em what you're doing of course.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.077
They're supportive.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.299
I mean, they'll always be
my mom and dad.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.954
But they also knew
that I was always curious

21:00.041 --> 21:02.478
about my birth mom.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.393
And they wanted to help,
but didn't have

21:04.480 --> 21:06.090
any of the information,

21:06.177 --> 21:09.877
because those records
were sealed to everyone.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.271
But when I found you,

21:12.358 --> 21:14.795
they said I should do
whatever I thought was best.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.712
Well, I'm glad you did.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.149
Yeah, me too.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.891
Hate to interrupt, but, uh,

21:23.978 --> 21:25.936
why is my car still in the shop?

21:26.023 --> 21:28.330
Oh, just a few more days.
Yeah.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.637
Oh, what the hell
is taking them so long?

21:30.724 --> 21:32.552
[Laura] Skylar.

21:32.639 --> 21:36.382
It was a recall.
They had to order the parts.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.298
Okay, well, I'm staying
after school tomorrow

21:39.385 --> 21:40.647
to make up for my science quiz,

21:40.690 --> 21:42.823
so one of you
needs to pick me up.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.694
- Oh.
- Um...

21:44.738 --> 21:47.218
I'm not gonna be home in time.
Sorry, sweetheart.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.525
- You?
- Yeah. No, I'm sorry, Sky.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.180
I have an appointment.

21:52.223 --> 21:55.357
Okay. Well,
then how am I gonna get home?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.794
Skylar, I can pick you up.

21:57.881 --> 22:01.320
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Cool.
That sounds great.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.889
Uh, Bree,
that's, that's really nice.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.065
I-I'm just, I'm not sure
if that's a great idea.

22:08.152 --> 22:11.068
I-I think it's a great idea.
Yeah.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.505
- You do?
- God! yeah, I...

22:12.592 --> 22:13.593
It gives them the chance
to spend

22:13.680 --> 22:15.203
a little more time together.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.860
I mean, that is, Bree,
if, if you don't mind.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.471
It'd be my pleasure.

22:25.474 --> 22:26.693
[school bell rings]

22:28.129 --> 22:31.045
[instrumental music]

23:10.911 --> 23:12.565
- Nowhere to run to, bitch!
- Ah!

23:12.652 --> 23:14.262
- What are you gonna do, huh?
- Stop! Get off of me!

23:14.305 --> 23:16.090
What are you gonna do?
Come on!

23:17.483 --> 23:18.701
[groans]

23:18.788 --> 23:19.963
You know, I always wanted

23:20.050 --> 23:22.531
to kick your ass just because...

23:22.618 --> 23:23.967
[groans]

23:24.054 --> 23:25.795
- And now I have a reason, too.
- [grunts]

23:25.882 --> 23:27.144
You think you can mess
with my boyfriend

23:27.231 --> 23:28.798
and get away with it?

23:28.885 --> 23:30.060
What are you talking about?

23:30.147 --> 23:32.106
I never spoke with him.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.586
Oh. Wait, wait.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.152
Are you talking about last night

23:35.196 --> 23:36.937
when he was crawling
out of my window?

23:37.024 --> 23:38.852
- How did you know about...
- Shut up!

23:38.939 --> 23:40.767
I'm gonna enjoy this.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.116
Hey, Sky.

23:46.033 --> 23:48.514
Oh. Forgot
you were picking me up.

23:48.557 --> 23:51.473
I thought I was gonna have
to take a substantial beating.

23:51.517 --> 23:54.084
Oh, you will.
You got lucky, little slut.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.043
See you tomorrow.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.785
All right. Sounds great.
See you then.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.006
Looks like I got here
in just the right time.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.400
Yeah. That's Chloe LoPresti.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.054
Anyone even glances
at her boyfriend

24:07.141 --> 24:09.056
and she goes ballistic.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.405
No one messes with her

24:10.492 --> 24:12.842
unless they wanna end up
in a hospital.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.844
Wait, you've gone
with her boyfriend?

24:14.931 --> 24:16.933
[laughing] No. No.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.109
He wasn't even talking to me.
It was the girl next to me.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.068
She's just crazy.

24:21.155 --> 24:23.679
So this happen a lot?

24:23.723 --> 24:26.116
Pretty much, yeah.

24:26.203 --> 24:30.860
Looks like I don't have a long
life expectancy at this school.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.254
Here. Just go to the car.
I'll be there in a minute.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.298
Okay.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.915
Seems like you and Sky
have a little issue.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.657
- Something I can help you with?
- And who the hell are you?

24:44.744 --> 24:46.572
I'm her sister.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.835
Then you should probably
mind your own business.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.360
Maybe tell your sister
to mind her own business, too.

24:52.447 --> 24:55.842
Wow. You're scary.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.147
How about this?

24:57.234 --> 24:59.236
You mind your own business

24:59.280 --> 25:01.412
and leave
all the other kids alone.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.719
See, sweetie, this stuff
might've worked in high school,

25:03.763 --> 25:06.156
but you're in
for a rude awakening in college.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.810
Whatever.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.728
Or at the local strip club.

25:12.772 --> 25:15.078
Yeah, you'd fit right in
at the Leopard Lounge.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.645
Huh. Bitch!

25:16.732 --> 25:17.690
[groans]

25:18.821 --> 25:20.344
[grunts]

25:22.346 --> 25:24.000
That was easy.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.089
Not so tough now, are you?

25:26.133 --> 25:29.397
Now you listen to me,
you little skank.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.355
I'm here for the long haul.

25:31.442 --> 25:34.228
And if I hear
that you're messing with someone

25:34.271 --> 25:37.448
or if you even look
at my sister,

25:37.536 --> 25:39.625
you know what I'm gonna do
to you?

25:39.668 --> 25:44.107
I will carve up
that pretty little face of yours

25:44.194 --> 25:48.285
and not even the janitor
would take you to prom.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.373
Now do you believe me

25:49.460 --> 25:50.853
that I am totally

25:50.940 --> 25:53.552
and completely serious?

25:56.555 --> 25:57.991
Good.

25:58.078 --> 25:59.079
- [grunts]
- [groans]

26:13.920 --> 26:15.878
[sighs]

26:25.627 --> 26:27.237
[exhales sharply]

26:29.239 --> 26:31.720
I didn't mean for you
to take this the wrong way.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.812
What I meant was,
we don't really know her...

26:36.899 --> 26:39.598
I know everything
that I need to know about her.

26:47.867 --> 26:52.088
Now, I know that
she's your biological daughter,

26:52.175 --> 26:55.396
but that doesn't really mean
she's your daughter-daughter.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.790
Okay, wait, w-what the hell
does that even mean?

27:01.924 --> 27:04.013
It means
that you didn't raise her,

27:04.100 --> 27:08.191
that wedidn't raise her.

27:08.278 --> 27:11.020
It means that we don't know
anything about her values,

27:11.064 --> 27:12.892
her decision-making,

27:12.979 --> 27:15.851
how she feels,
what she thinks, anything.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.636
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.595
So we just
get to know her better.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.379
Okay.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.773
But until then,

27:24.860 --> 27:27.646
I really wanna treat her
like a member of our family.

27:30.126 --> 27:33.347
But she's not really
a member of the family.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.175
Yes, she is.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.180
Uh, Michael,
I owe her that much.

27:43.792 --> 27:44.663
Please?

27:47.448 --> 27:49.624
Okay, well...

27:49.711 --> 27:53.715
If that's what you think,
no nooky for you tonight.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.761
Well, you should be so lucky.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.066
Yeah.

27:57.153 --> 27:59.416
Um, get your light.

27:59.503 --> 28:01.680
- I'll get your light.
- [laughs]

28:05.640 --> 28:08.556
[instrumental music]

28:26.443 --> 28:27.662
[doorbell rings]

28:47.464 --> 28:49.510
Hi.

28:49.597 --> 28:52.469
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Mr. Parker?

28:52.556 --> 28:54.863
- Yup.
- My name is Jon LoPresti.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.561
It appears that your daughter
had an altercation

28:57.648 --> 29:00.739
with my daughter at school
this past week.

29:00.826 --> 29:04.220
Um... Well, come in.
Let's, let's talk.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.050
Right in here, please.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.712
- [sighs] Uh, Jon. Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.280
Just give me a moment.
I'm gonna call Skylar down.

29:22.282 --> 29:26.112
Hey, Sky, can you and mom
come down, please?

29:29.071 --> 29:31.987
So I'm sure this is just
all a big misunderstanding.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.510
Yeah, I hope so
because your daughter made

29:33.554 --> 29:36.296
a lot of vile threats
to my daughter.

29:36.383 --> 29:39.821
And Chloe's really,
really shaken up about it.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.389
I can't even imagine.
Um...

29:42.476 --> 29:43.782
Yeah, you can't.

29:43.869 --> 29:44.957
Yeah, dad?

29:46.567 --> 29:49.265
This is Mr... I'm sorry, um...

29:49.352 --> 29:52.181
Yeah, it's Jon. Jon LoPresti.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.967
[Michael] So...
[Laura] What's going on?

29:55.054 --> 29:57.708
Well, Mr. LoPresti here says

29:57.796 --> 30:00.494
that there was some sort
of an altercation at school

30:00.581 --> 30:03.976
with his daughter
and some threats were made.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.455
Sky?

30:05.499 --> 30:07.718
Uh, I-I, um...

30:07.762 --> 30:11.548
[inhales] I think
I can clear this up.

30:11.635 --> 30:14.334
I spoke to your daughter.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.292
I was picking Sky up from school

30:16.379 --> 30:19.556
and I saw her picking on her.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.908
You know, bullying her
pretty badly, actually.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.257
Uh, who are you now?

30:25.171 --> 30:28.000
I'm Sky's sister.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.654
Mr. LoPresti, is this true? Was
your daughter the instigator?

30:35.572 --> 30:38.488
Look, I don't know,
but I doubt it.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.142
What I do know for a fact
is what you said

30:40.229 --> 30:41.752
and the threats that you made,
you can't just

30:41.796 --> 30:43.276
go around talking
to other kids like that...

30:43.363 --> 30:44.320
Wait, wait, wait.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.800
What exactly did your daughter

30:45.887 --> 30:47.541
say that she said?

30:52.720 --> 30:56.463
Uh, she, uh, she, she...

30:56.550 --> 30:57.812
Look.

30:59.988 --> 31:03.731
I may have been a little harsh.
Yeah, I'll admit that.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.996
But when I saw her...

31:08.083 --> 31:10.259
When I saw your daughter

31:10.346 --> 31:13.697
picking on Sky, my sister,

31:13.741 --> 31:16.178
who wouldn't hurt a fly,

31:16.265 --> 31:20.617
I guess
I just got a little angry.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.882
[Laura] And that
is perfectly reasonable.

31:23.969 --> 31:27.015
Mr. LoPresti, if I could
give you a little bit of advice,

31:27.102 --> 31:28.451
parent to parent,

31:28.538 --> 31:30.149
maybe you could have
your daughter

31:30.236 --> 31:32.064
stop harassing my daughter.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.899
I will show myself out.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.164
It's okay. God.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.906
[Laura] Are you okay, honey?
[Skylar] Yeah.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.908
[Laura] Why wouldn't you
tell me that?

32:00.788 --> 32:02.572
[Skylar] It's, um, no big deal.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.619
[sighs] It's a big deal.

32:05.706 --> 32:08.361
- Thank you so much, Bree.
- Of course.

32:08.448 --> 32:11.799
For looking out for her.
Oh, girls.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.935
I got your barbecue invitation
for this weekend.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.720
Your wife sent it to me.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.984
- No?
- Oh.

32:23.071 --> 32:25.465
I didn't realize
we were... inviting.

32:25.508 --> 32:28.642
- [chuckles]
- Uh, uh, what's the occasion?

32:28.729 --> 32:32.646
Uh, well, I don't know
if there's actually an occasion.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.389
But I might as well tell you

32:36.476 --> 32:38.869
since everyone's gonna be
talking about it.

32:38.913 --> 32:41.960
- Ooh, this is getting good.
- No, no, no. No, no.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.919
- So, um, when Laura was young...
- Mm-hmm.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.790
- Well, before she knew me...
- Ooh.

32:46.877 --> 32:50.794
She gave a child
up for adoption.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.840
Everything was supposed to be
confidential,

32:52.927 --> 32:56.278
but she found us, the girl.

32:56.365 --> 32:59.978
She tracked Laura down
and so the party is...

33:00.065 --> 33:03.068
- Are you kidding?
- No kidding.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.939
Is she some kind of lunatic?

33:05.026 --> 33:07.463
Uh, no, she's, she's actually,

33:07.550 --> 33:09.030
she's actually
a perfectly lovely,

33:09.117 --> 33:11.772
well-adjusted young woman, so...

33:12.991 --> 33:14.644
So what's the problem?

33:16.429 --> 33:17.734
I really don't know.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.128
Well, I, for one,
am stoked to meet her.

33:20.215 --> 33:21.738
What's, uh, what's her name,
anyway?

33:21.825 --> 33:23.958
Her name is Bree.

33:24.045 --> 33:27.701
- Your new daughter?
- No. Bree. Bree.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.008
- Bree Hogan.
- Bree Hogan.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.359
That sounds made-up.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.755
- Look, I gotta get going and...
- [laughing]

33:38.842 --> 33:41.628
- Don't you have work to do?
- Don't you have to go?

33:41.715 --> 33:42.890
Get to work.
I pay you for that.

33:42.977 --> 33:45.675
Such a good boss.
Grade-A boss.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.982
You should get
some sort of award.

33:53.640 --> 33:57.339
Search Bree Hogan. H-O-G-A-N.

33:58.732 --> 34:01.300
Hogan. Not cheese. Hogan.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.128
[instrumental music]

34:03.215 --> 34:06.044
[indistinct chatter]

34:15.139 --> 34:16.315
Hi.

34:16.402 --> 34:17.402
Girls.

34:22.277 --> 34:25.018
[indistinct chatter]

34:25.106 --> 34:26.672
[laughing]

34:26.760 --> 34:28.849
Okay, Tom.
There you are, buddy.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.634
- The truth. Lost Lighthouse.
- Information.

34:31.678 --> 34:34.246
All right, Mr. Tom.
The truth, the whole truth.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.117
All right, well, first,
let me preface this by saying

34:36.204 --> 34:38.206
I'm sure
that their internal counsel

34:38.293 --> 34:40.121
looked at everything
very closely.

34:40.165 --> 34:44.603
But I'm not convinced that
the entire enterprise is legal.

34:44.647 --> 34:45.648
Hm.

34:45.735 --> 34:46.735
Leave it to a lawyer

34:46.822 --> 34:48.695
to think about the legal aspects

34:48.782 --> 34:50.349
of the story.

34:50.391 --> 34:52.655
That's why he is the best.
And I mean, the best.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.309
No, in all seriousness, though,
this...

34:54.396 --> 34:55.963
It seems
that this entire company,

34:56.050 --> 34:58.748
this, um, Lost Lighthouse
or whatever it's called,

34:58.835 --> 35:00.750
I-it was formed
solely for the purpose

35:00.794 --> 35:02.491
of encouraging people

35:02.578 --> 35:06.321
to breach confidential
legal documents, all right?

35:06.408 --> 35:07.540
Honey, you're acting like
this is

35:07.627 --> 35:09.281
some kind
of corporate espionage.

35:09.368 --> 35:12.153
They're just reuniting
parents and children.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.981
Well, intent is irrelevant,

35:14.068 --> 35:16.288
I mean, [chuckles] in the eyes
of law. You know this.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.767
[Laura] Really? Okay.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.117
Well,
then why are serial killers

35:19.160 --> 35:20.118
punished more harshly

35:20.161 --> 35:21.902
than someone who accidentally

35:21.989 --> 35:24.513
killed someone in a car crash?

35:24.557 --> 35:27.864
Okay, first off,
easy, Clarence Darrow.

35:27.951 --> 35:29.388
- [Tom] First off.
- I wanna know.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.869
In this instant,
it's just irrelevant, okay?

35:32.956 --> 35:34.871
I mean, if you're going
to induce someone

35:34.958 --> 35:35.916
to break a contract,

35:36.003 --> 35:38.048
even if your, uh,

35:38.092 --> 35:42.009
your-your-your intentions
are noble, okay?

35:42.052 --> 35:44.881
It's still illegal.

35:44.925 --> 35:47.623
I'm glad she found us.
I don't care how it happened.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.670
- Me, too.
- Mm, yeah.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.327
So where is this young woman
I've heard so much about?

35:55.370 --> 35:57.024
- [Laura] Oh.
- Um...

35:57.111 --> 35:58.852
Uh, she is...

35:58.939 --> 36:01.681
Oh, she's over there
talking to Sky.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.034
Oh, yeah.
She looks very sweet.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.645
Yeah. She is.
You know, it's so funny.

36:09.732 --> 36:11.734
Usually, Sky hates meeting
new people, right?

36:11.778 --> 36:14.607
But the two of them
have just really hit it off.

36:15.956 --> 36:18.001
Are you gonna introduce us or...

36:18.088 --> 36:20.308
Oh, let 'em be.

36:20.395 --> 36:23.355
Yeah, I don't want her to feel
like she's on display, you know?

36:23.442 --> 36:25.226
- [Laura] Later, later.
- Well, on that note...

36:25.313 --> 36:27.837
Here comes someone who's
never been confused with sweet.

36:27.924 --> 36:28.969
[Gareth] There he is.
[Laura] Hey.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.449
- Gareth. Hey, man.
- Michael.

36:30.536 --> 36:31.885
Good to see you, man.
Thanks for coming.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.800
- Good to see you.
- Uh, Tom, Clarissa.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.236
This is Gareth Drury.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.021
He is our top programmer.

36:38.108 --> 36:41.677
Uh, have you met Tom Caldwell?
He is our company lawyer.

36:41.721 --> 36:42.852
Oh, of course.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.854
- No, not officially.
- Yeah.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.117
But I've seen your e-mail
on plenty of memos.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.380
- Um...
- And invoices.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.599
Invoices, memos.
Still a pleasure.

36:50.643 --> 36:51.818
Oh, yeah, well, good, man.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.123
- This is my wife, Clarissa.
- Oh.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.386
- Oh, lovely.
- Nice to meet you.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.387
Join us, man. Come on.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.736
- Please.
- There he is.

36:56.823 --> 36:59.521
Last, but not least.
Come here, you.

36:59.608 --> 37:00.870
- Hey, sweetheart.
- All right.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.611
That's enough. That's enough.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.396
- Oh, please.
- Who are you, Sinatra now?

37:04.483 --> 37:06.572
Baby, you know I'm the leader
of the rat pack.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.269
- Don't even start with me.
- [chuckles]

37:08.313 --> 37:10.445
So I brought you this Bourbon
I've been drinking.

37:10.489 --> 37:13.187
- It's very smooth, small batch.
- Nice.

37:13.274 --> 37:14.928
I bring it to your bar

37:15.015 --> 37:17.670
and what do I see
but wine coolers

37:17.757 --> 37:19.411
and light beer.

37:19.454 --> 37:22.152
I'm guilty. [chuckles]

37:22.196 --> 37:25.547
Oh, so you open a gift to us
and proceeded to help yourself.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.332
- No. No, no, no.
- [Michael] And drink it.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.509
- I did not have a choice, did I?
- Well, it doesn't seem like it.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.162
I'll tell you what.
You're a man after my own heart.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.990
- I'm gonna get one.
- No. Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

37:34.034 --> 37:36.123
- Please, I'll get you a glass.
- [Michael clears throat]

37:36.166 --> 37:37.124
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.604
All right.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.475
[Laura] You gotta watch out
for that guy.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.260
Not too carefully, I hope.

37:46.176 --> 37:49.049
[indistinct chatter]

37:55.273 --> 37:58.101
Well, well, well.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.147
You must be
the one and only Bree.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.889
I've been looking for you.

38:02.976 --> 38:04.891
[deep breathes]

38:07.850 --> 38:09.025
Excuse me?

38:09.112 --> 38:10.113
I was hoping you and I could

38:10.200 --> 38:12.638
have a little chat later.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.509
Who are you?

38:14.596 --> 38:17.382
- I'm Gareth Drury.
- Ah.

38:17.425 --> 38:20.907
I work for Michael, and I have
heard a lot about you.

38:22.996 --> 38:24.476
- Oh.
- See...

38:24.563 --> 38:25.868
Part of my job is knowing

38:25.912 --> 38:27.696
how to actually
use the Internet.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.612
And correct me if I'm wrong,

38:30.699 --> 38:32.048
but you've not been
completely honest

38:32.092 --> 38:34.268
with your new family, have you?

38:36.401 --> 38:38.185
I'm sure
I don't know what you mean.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.666
No, I think you do.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.765
Have you told anyone?

38:53.679 --> 38:54.854
Well...

38:56.334 --> 38:58.336
not yet.

38:58.423 --> 39:00.686
I was thinking
I'd give you an opportunity

39:00.773 --> 39:02.601
to explain yourself.

39:06.605 --> 39:07.823
Thank you.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.216
[chuckles]

39:12.437 --> 39:13.829
Don't thank me yet.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.875
[intense music]

39:27.626 --> 39:28.931
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh

39:28.975 --> 39:31.238
â™ª You know it feels right

39:31.325 --> 39:32.500
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh â™ª

39:32.587 --> 39:33.936
- Well, that was fast.
- Ah.

39:34.023 --> 39:34.981
Well, I was just pouring it.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.244
Not distilling it.

39:37.287 --> 39:38.811
- Okay. Yeah.
- That's clever.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.987
- I appreciate it. Hm.
- It's good, right?

39:41.074 --> 39:44.599
Mm. Mm. Yeah, that's nice.
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

39:44.643 --> 39:45.731
- [Gareth] Yeah, of course.
- Have a seat.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.602
Uh, I will in a minute.

39:47.689 --> 39:49.778
I still need to use
the facility.

39:49.865 --> 39:51.171
[Laura] Oh.
[Gareth] Two seconds, promise.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.738
- [Laura] All right.
- All right.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.958
[exhales sharply]

39:56.002 --> 39:57.046
[doorknob rattling]

39:57.133 --> 39:58.265
[knocking on door]

40:00.267 --> 40:01.268
[man] In a minute.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.835
Oh, come on, man.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.756
[indistinct song playing]

40:16.762 --> 40:19.286
[sighing]

40:24.726 --> 40:26.119
Mm...

40:27.033 --> 40:28.295
Oh...

40:31.516 --> 40:32.865
Watering the flowers?

40:33.692 --> 40:34.954
[coughing]

40:34.997 --> 40:37.783
Uh... Oh, God, you scared me.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.873
You know,
I've been thinking about it.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.005
Yeah. About what?

40:43.092 --> 40:45.399
About what you said.

40:45.486 --> 40:46.574
You know, you really
should've told Michael

40:46.661 --> 40:47.575
when you had the chance.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.447
And why is that?

40:50.970 --> 40:53.276
'Cause now it's too late.

40:53.363 --> 40:54.452
- [gasping, groaning]
- [Bree grunts]

40:54.539 --> 40:57.455
[intense music]

41:51.204 --> 41:53.728
[Michael] It wasn't, it wasn't
last time they-they stayed here.

41:53.772 --> 41:55.425
[Tom] Sure you'll pay for it...

41:55.513 --> 41:58.080
Oh, wait. Bree! Hey, honey.
Come on over.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.343
I want you to meet
some friends of ours.

42:00.430 --> 42:01.954
[Laura] Oh. [chuckling]

42:03.390 --> 42:04.652
[Clarissa] Hey!

42:04.739 --> 42:06.654
- This is Mr. and Mrs. Caldwell.
- Hey.

42:06.741 --> 42:09.352
And Tom just so happens to be
the attorney

42:09.396 --> 42:10.484
at Michael's company.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.399
- [Michael] He's my hero.
- Hi.

42:12.486 --> 42:15.054
- [Tom] Um, not really.
- Well, Tom and Clarissa.

42:15.141 --> 42:17.447
- No need to be so formal.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.753
We've heard so much
about you, Bree.

42:18.840 --> 42:20.407
Why don't you sit down
and join us?

42:20.494 --> 42:22.714
- Yeah.
- I-I'd love to.

42:22.801 --> 42:24.585
But I actually promised Sky

42:24.672 --> 42:26.805
that I would help her
with something.

42:26.892 --> 42:28.763
Uh, we got a new filter
for the yearbook.

42:28.807 --> 42:30.548
- That's great.
- Okay. Well...

42:30.635 --> 42:32.767
Don't leave without telling me,
please, because I want you

42:32.811 --> 42:34.073
to meet Gareth,
he's the only one

42:34.160 --> 42:35.291
you haven't met.
He's dying to meet you.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.642
- You'll love him.
- [Michael] Yeah.

42:37.729 --> 42:40.906
Gareth. Is that the young...

42:40.993 --> 42:45.432
Tall hair, big mouth...
You got it. Did you guys meet?

42:45.475 --> 42:48.609
Yeah, uh, for like two seconds.

42:48.653 --> 42:51.394
Uh, he was actually
going to his car.

42:51.438 --> 42:53.135
H-his Uber, actually.

42:53.179 --> 42:56.051
Uh, I know,
'cause, um, I made a joke

42:56.138 --> 42:59.533
about how he was walking,
maybe he shouldn't be driving.

42:59.620 --> 43:01.491
- Oh... yeah.
- [Laura sighs]

43:01.535 --> 43:04.146
- That sounds like Gareth.
- [Laura] It's, uh, early.

43:04.190 --> 43:06.714
All right, well,
maybe next time.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.890
- [Laura] Yeah.
- Excuse me.

43:08.977 --> 43:10.544
- Okay. It was great meeting you.
- Yeah, nice meeting you.

43:10.631 --> 43:12.981
You, too.

43:13.025 --> 43:15.157
Well, I dunno about you, but
I could certainly use another.

43:15.244 --> 43:17.072
- Yes, please.
- How about you?

43:17.159 --> 43:20.075
I could use one, but should I
have one? That's the question.

43:20.162 --> 43:21.120
- Do you want anything, honey?
- No.

43:21.163 --> 43:22.774
- Gentlemen. Nothing?
- Okay.

43:22.861 --> 43:24.602
Uh, I'm good, honey.
Thank you.

43:29.084 --> 43:31.043
You're right, man, she's lovely.

43:31.130 --> 43:33.785
Who, Laura?
Thank you very much.

43:33.872 --> 43:35.090
Eyes over here, pal.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.788
- Come on.
- [Michael chuckling]

43:39.878 --> 43:44.012
So I, uh... I thought you could
do something for me.

43:44.099 --> 43:45.623
Hm.

43:45.710 --> 43:48.408
Just, maybe, look into her.

43:48.495 --> 43:50.628
Do a background check...

43:50.715 --> 43:52.586
Whatever it is that you,
you know, you do.

43:53.979 --> 43:56.590
Why? Are you worried
about something?

43:56.677 --> 43:59.245
No... No, I'm just...

43:59.332 --> 44:01.595
I'm just curious.

44:01.682 --> 44:04.685
All right, I charge $500 an
hour. Are you that worried?

44:04.729 --> 44:07.166
[chuckles] Well, I was hoping
maybe you could just do this

44:07.253 --> 44:09.342
kind of unofficially,
you know, off the books.

44:09.385 --> 44:10.560
- Ah.
- [Michael] As it were.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.475
So you're really,
really worried.

44:12.562 --> 44:15.000
[sniffles]

44:15.087 --> 44:16.654
Come on, man. What is it?

44:19.265 --> 44:21.571
It's just all too convenient.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.487
You know, she just shows up
out of the blue.

44:24.574 --> 44:27.012
Laura is head over heels
for her.

44:27.099 --> 44:29.754
Even Sky loves her.

44:29.841 --> 44:34.149
I just, I just wanna make sure
everything is on the up and up.

44:37.283 --> 44:39.415
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

44:39.502 --> 44:41.679
Then why not hire
a private investigator?

44:41.722 --> 44:44.072
No, I'm not completely paranoid.

44:44.116 --> 44:47.510
Can you just, can you just
look into it for me?

44:47.597 --> 44:49.861
For me.

44:49.904 --> 44:52.211
Yeah, no... I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I can.

44:52.254 --> 44:54.866
[chuckling]

44:54.909 --> 44:56.955
See? I knew you were my hero.

44:57.042 --> 44:58.652
[chuckling]

44:58.739 --> 44:59.653
- Thank you.
- Cheers, man.

44:59.740 --> 45:00.567
Yeah.

45:04.223 --> 45:05.398
I'll have to teach your friends
some manners.

45:05.485 --> 45:07.400
- They are a mess.
- Yeah.

45:07.487 --> 45:09.141
- Uh, uh, uh! Oh!
- Whoa, get it!

45:09.228 --> 45:10.185
- Oh, my gosh.
- [Michael] Good job!

45:10.272 --> 45:11.883
Good catch. All right.

45:11.970 --> 45:12.971
Bye, dad.
We're gonna go help mom.

45:13.058 --> 45:14.276
So have fun.

45:14.320 --> 45:15.800
- Help mom?
- Helping her... Yeah.

45:15.843 --> 45:17.192
- Oh, okay. I see it.
- I think, I think...

45:17.279 --> 45:18.367
No, I got it.
We're good, we're good.

45:18.454 --> 45:19.629
[Skylar] I think you'll be fine.

45:19.673 --> 45:22.241
[chuckles] I don't have
a choice.

45:23.416 --> 45:24.591
[grunting]

45:26.941 --> 45:29.814
[instrumental music]

45:34.557 --> 45:36.908
[indistinct chatter on radio]

45:38.039 --> 45:41.260
Ah. Detectives. Hi.

45:41.347 --> 45:43.088
We stopped by earlier
in the day, but it looked like

45:43.175 --> 45:45.699
you were having a nice little
party. Didn't wanna disturb you.

45:45.786 --> 45:48.571
[Michael] Yeah, just a little
gathering with some friends.

45:48.658 --> 45:51.270
Um, did I miss
something important?

45:51.357 --> 45:52.837
Should I, should I get Laura
for this?

45:52.924 --> 45:55.013
Maybe we can have a chat first.

45:55.100 --> 45:57.319
Somewhere a little more private.

45:57.363 --> 45:59.234
[Michael] Uh, yeah, sure.

45:59.321 --> 46:00.409
I mean, I'm just finishing up
here.

46:00.496 --> 46:02.411
If you guys will just follow me.

46:02.498 --> 46:04.196
[chuckles] Follow me, gentlemen.

46:04.283 --> 46:05.414
- Yeah.
- Please.

46:05.501 --> 46:06.589
[Skylar] Hey, Bree.

46:06.676 --> 46:08.113
Can you help me with this?

46:14.336 --> 46:17.557
Okay, detectives.
So, uh, what's going on?

46:17.644 --> 46:20.125
I'm afraid the, uh, odds have
changed a bit, Mr. Parker.

46:20.212 --> 46:22.257
And, um, not in our favor.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.042
Sorry, I'm not following you.

46:24.129 --> 46:27.480
[chuckles] The death
of your wife's parents,

46:27.567 --> 46:29.569
if you recall, we told you
it was a 50-50 chance

46:29.656 --> 46:31.179
that it was an accident.

46:31.223 --> 46:32.528
Well, it seems
we now have reason to believe

46:32.615 --> 46:34.922
it was intentional.

46:35.009 --> 46:37.229
- Intentional?
- Afraid so.

46:37.316 --> 46:39.231
Seems that one of the neighbors,
under further questioning,

46:39.318 --> 46:42.712
remember seeing a young woman
visit the property

46:42.800 --> 46:45.411
on the day of the accident.

46:45.498 --> 46:47.239
Well, who was she?

46:47.326 --> 46:49.632
- We don't know yet.
- Hm.

46:49.719 --> 46:51.721
The neighbor didn't get
a good look at her.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.288
Just said she was a young woman.

46:53.332 --> 46:54.463
[door squeaking]

46:56.814 --> 46:58.598
Look, there was no reason
to suspect

46:58.685 --> 47:00.643
that something might have
went amiss.

47:00.730 --> 47:03.951
Uh, detective.
You need some help over there?

47:07.302 --> 47:08.608
No, I'm okay.

47:09.739 --> 47:13.439
So, um, I just wanna confirm.

47:13.526 --> 47:16.137
Your wife really hasn't seen
her parents in...

47:16.224 --> 47:18.618
what, twen-twenty years?

47:18.705 --> 47:21.447
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a long time.

47:21.534 --> 47:24.189
Yeah, detectives,
I hope you're not suggesting

47:24.276 --> 47:26.844
that Laura had anything to do
with this.

47:26.931 --> 47:29.542
No, no. Of course not.
Of course not.

47:29.629 --> 47:31.718
We just wanna make sure
that there's nothing, uh,

47:31.761 --> 47:34.852
nothing at all
that you're not telling us.

47:36.723 --> 47:39.769
- Like what?
- Mm.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.294
You tell us, Mr. Parker. Mm.

47:44.035 --> 47:46.341
Well, like I already told you,

47:46.428 --> 47:48.039
I don't know anything
about this.

47:48.126 --> 47:49.779
Um, I mean, you guys are welcome

47:49.867 --> 47:51.869
to ask Laura more questions
if you like...

47:51.956 --> 47:53.827
[chuckling]

47:58.484 --> 48:00.051
Nah.

48:00.138 --> 48:01.748
- I don't think that's necessary.
- [Holmes] No. Yeah.

48:01.835 --> 48:03.532
Yeah, we're sure you're right,
you know?

48:03.619 --> 48:06.274
She wouldn't know anything
about this mystery woman.

48:06.361 --> 48:08.233
We'll let you get back
to cleaning up.

48:11.584 --> 48:14.892
Oh, uh, Mr. Parker,
do us a favor.

48:14.979 --> 48:16.241
Give it some more thought.

48:16.328 --> 48:18.286
You know,
something might shake loose.

48:18.373 --> 48:20.898
It's amazing what people
can remember when they need to.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.436
[dramatic music]

48:46.575 --> 48:48.186
[Michael sighing]

48:48.273 --> 48:50.275
Hey. I thought you got lost.

48:52.842 --> 48:53.756
Michael?

48:55.584 --> 48:57.282
You okay?

48:57.369 --> 49:00.676
Yeah, yeah. No, no.
It's a... That was a big party.

49:00.763 --> 49:02.722
- Yeah.
- A lot to clean up. Yeah.

49:02.809 --> 49:05.768
Shed was a mess...
Those kids, they can, they can...

49:05.855 --> 49:08.075
I think
I should probably get going.

49:08.162 --> 49:10.208
I-I said
that I'd be back for dinner.

49:10.295 --> 49:12.340
Well, I can probably
never eat again, but...

49:12.427 --> 49:15.778
[laughing] Oh, thank you so much
for coming, Bree.

49:15.865 --> 49:18.216
I know that everybody
just loved meeting you.

49:19.913 --> 49:21.784
Hey, thanks
for helping me today.

49:21.871 --> 49:23.482
- [Laura] Well, yeah.
- Um, I'll see you later?

49:23.569 --> 49:25.092
- Yeah, totally.
- Cool.

49:25.179 --> 49:27.616
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

49:27.703 --> 49:29.488
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

49:30.706 --> 49:31.664
[Bree] Bye, mom.

49:31.707 --> 49:32.665
[gasping]

49:37.235 --> 49:40.107
[dramatic music]

49:59.039 --> 50:00.171
[engine starts]

50:07.352 --> 50:09.136
Maybe he really
doesn't know anything.

50:10.355 --> 50:11.617
- He knows something.
- Yeah.

50:11.704 --> 50:13.445
They don't seem like
killers to me.

50:14.707 --> 50:16.578
I never said they were killers.

50:16.622 --> 50:19.320
I said they know more
than they're letting on.

50:19.407 --> 50:21.540
There's something
they're keeping from us.

50:21.627 --> 50:22.715
What?

50:24.673 --> 50:27.285
That I don't know.

50:27.372 --> 50:29.896
But I think I'm gonna pay them
another visit.

50:29.939 --> 50:32.464
One when
they're least expecting it.

50:32.551 --> 50:34.422
No way a judge is gonna give us
a warrant.

50:34.509 --> 50:38.078
Not even your buddy Adam, and
not for something this flimsy.

50:38.165 --> 50:39.906
Since when do you need a warrant
to go for a stroll

50:39.949 --> 50:41.995
on a beautiful afternoon?

50:42.082 --> 50:43.736
[chuckles]

50:43.779 --> 50:44.911
[engine starts]

51:13.679 --> 51:14.897
Are you okay?

51:16.682 --> 51:18.727
You're just, I don't know...

51:18.814 --> 51:20.729
You've been kind of quiet
since the barbecue.

51:21.687 --> 51:23.254
Yes, of course.

51:23.297 --> 51:25.560
Okay.

51:25.647 --> 51:28.085
Well, I think everybody had
a really good time. Don't you?

51:29.912 --> 51:32.350
I do. Congratulations.

51:32.437 --> 51:34.613
[scoffs] Thank you.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.529
[Laura] So...

51:39.835 --> 51:41.881
Did Tom say anything?

51:41.968 --> 51:43.796
You know, about Bree.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.626
Um... no, not really.

51:48.801 --> 51:50.846
Except that she seemed sweet.

51:50.933 --> 51:53.806
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

51:56.417 --> 51:57.897
Well, I'm exhausted.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.117
Okay.

52:12.912 --> 52:14.435
You know,
I've-I've been thinking.

52:14.522 --> 52:15.567
Mm?

52:17.046 --> 52:19.005
About your parents.

52:20.572 --> 52:21.834
My parents?

52:28.188 --> 52:29.450
I haven't even thought
about my parents.

52:29.537 --> 52:30.930
Why would you?

52:33.498 --> 52:36.501
Did Bree know anything
about them?

52:36.588 --> 52:39.286
I mean, yeah, I told her.

52:39.373 --> 52:42.768
You know, how, how it was
their decision to...

52:42.855 --> 52:45.292
Their decision to give her up
for adoption.

52:45.379 --> 52:46.859
Yeah. Why?

52:49.905 --> 52:51.342
Nothing, just...

52:51.429 --> 52:53.735
Tom put something in your head?

52:53.822 --> 52:56.956
'Cause, you know, it's just
like him to be suspicious.

52:57.043 --> 53:00.177
Tom didn't say anything.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.179
Okay, well,
then why the third degree?

53:04.224 --> 53:07.053
This is hardly the third degree,
Laura.

53:07.096 --> 53:08.185
All right, well...

53:09.969 --> 53:13.015
Look, I'm just too tired
to talk about this nonsense.

53:14.539 --> 53:16.454
Honestly.

53:16.541 --> 53:18.456
It was such a beautiful day.

53:21.110 --> 53:22.808
Please don't ruin it.

53:50.705 --> 53:53.578
[line ringing]

53:58.191 --> 53:59.540
[Gareth on voicemail]
You've reached Gareth.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.541
You know what to do.

54:00.628 --> 54:02.413
Gareth, it's Michael.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.284
Hey, buddy.

54:04.371 --> 54:05.633
You're not responding
to my e-mails or texts.

54:05.720 --> 54:09.158
I need you today. Call me.

54:09.202 --> 54:11.509
And I better not hear
you're hung over. You got that?

54:11.596 --> 54:13.424
[chuckles] Call me.

54:15.426 --> 54:17.036
[sighs]

54:19.691 --> 54:21.910
Yeah. How you doing?

54:21.997 --> 54:25.218
I am sorry, man. Please. Sit.

54:25.305 --> 54:28.961
[Michael] Sorry. Ah.
[Tom] What's up?

54:29.004 --> 54:30.832
You remember Gareth,
the one you met at the party.

54:30.919 --> 54:32.878
- Yeah, yeah. That guy.
- I can't get in touch with him.

54:32.965 --> 54:35.097
- And, uh... [grunts]
- Ah, come on.

54:35.184 --> 54:38.187
He's young. Come on,
he's-he's irresponsible.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.059
Just like I assume we were.

54:40.146 --> 54:42.583
Yes, but not on my dime.

54:42.670 --> 54:44.977
- Right, right.
- Anyways. So, uh...

54:45.020 --> 54:46.413
What you got for me, huh?

54:46.500 --> 54:48.154
So, listen,
I, I didn't dig too deep.

54:48.241 --> 54:51.288
But I, um,
I did what you asked me to.

54:51.375 --> 54:53.551
And, you know, I'm happy to say

54:53.594 --> 54:56.684
it's, it's everything she said
it was gonna be. So...

54:56.728 --> 54:58.077
See, it's, uh, Bree Hogan

54:58.164 --> 55:01.298
adopted in
the State of California, 1996.

55:01.385 --> 55:03.517
She graduated
from Judd Elementary,

55:03.561 --> 55:05.824
uh, went to Memorial High School

55:05.911 --> 55:07.956
and attended West Lake College.

55:08.870 --> 55:10.785
So...

55:10.872 --> 55:12.178
That's it?

55:13.310 --> 55:14.659
Oh, I'm sorry. No.

55:14.746 --> 55:16.400
Um, apparently, she's also

55:16.487 --> 55:17.662
a cannibal with multiple
personalities.

55:17.749 --> 55:19.185
- Oh, come on.
- So there's that.

55:19.228 --> 55:20.621
I mean, what,
w-what did you think

55:20.708 --> 55:22.493
I was gonna find here?

55:22.580 --> 55:24.277
I don't know.
I just, I don't know.

55:24.364 --> 55:26.584
Okay, listen, look,
this corroborates everything

55:26.671 --> 55:27.976
she said, all right?

55:28.063 --> 55:29.326
Unless you have other suspicions

55:29.413 --> 55:30.892
and a good reason for 'em, man,

55:30.979 --> 55:32.416
you gotta let it go.

55:34.243 --> 55:35.810
- Yeah. Okay, all right.
- All right?

55:35.897 --> 55:37.551
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

55:37.595 --> 55:39.248
Listen to me,
I did this as your friend.

55:39.336 --> 55:41.729
But as your lawyer,
you need to get back to work.

55:41.773 --> 55:43.731
You need to forget
about all this stuff.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.864
All right?
It's fine, trust me.

55:47.822 --> 55:50.347
- A lawyer that says, "Trust me."
- Okay, come on. I gotta go.

55:50.434 --> 55:52.914
Thank you.
Sorry for missing you.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.699
- It's okay, you owe me a drink.
- Hey, I owe you one.

55:54.786 --> 55:56.875
- [Tom] Yeah. [chuckles]
- Yeah. [chuckles]

56:01.096 --> 56:02.489
I can't believe this.

56:02.576 --> 56:05.536
This is so ridiculous.

56:05.623 --> 56:09.104
So I know she only posted that
to embarrass me, right?

56:09.191 --> 56:11.193
And, of course, she denied it
and took it down,

56:11.280 --> 56:15.023
but Justin had already seen it.
Of course.

56:15.110 --> 56:17.504
Ugh. She's such a...

56:17.591 --> 56:20.594
You should probably be careful.

56:20.681 --> 56:22.988
Yeah, it's just
really messed up.

56:24.381 --> 56:25.512
Look.

56:27.558 --> 56:30.909
I don't wanna sound like
that annoying older sister,

56:30.996 --> 56:35.043
but you should probably watch
what you post on social media.

56:35.130 --> 56:37.263
I mean, I have friends
who lost jobs

56:37.350 --> 56:38.699
because their employers saw some

56:38.786 --> 56:40.571
embarrassing photo of them
online.

56:42.790 --> 56:46.228
Uh, I mean, don't get paranoid.
Just be smart.

56:46.272 --> 56:48.274
Yeah.

56:48.317 --> 56:51.886
So tell me, what's it like?

56:51.973 --> 56:54.759
Is your sister upset that you're
spending so much time here?

56:56.935 --> 56:59.807
We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

56:59.894 --> 57:01.896
No, uh... No, it's okay.
It's...

57:03.332 --> 57:06.031
Oh, to be honest, we weren't...

57:06.118 --> 57:07.554
never really that close.

57:10.818 --> 57:13.560
Must've been hard
being the adopted one, huh?

57:13.647 --> 57:16.563
Actually,
it was quite the opposite.

57:20.045 --> 57:22.221
My sister always had it
harder than me.

57:23.527 --> 57:25.964
I mean, my parents,

57:26.007 --> 57:27.748
they wanted to make sure
that because I was adopted,

57:27.835 --> 57:29.924
I never felt different.

57:30.011 --> 57:33.362
So they wanted me to feel like
I was just as much their kid

57:33.450 --> 57:35.103
as their biological one.

57:36.191 --> 57:37.802
So what was the problem?

57:39.804 --> 57:42.981
M-my sister, Jessica,

57:43.068 --> 57:44.983
she resented that.

57:46.375 --> 57:49.335
She felt like they favored me.

57:49.422 --> 57:51.642
So she started acting out,

57:51.729 --> 57:54.383
you know, try and get attention.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.516
You know, usually,
the adopted one's the one

57:56.603 --> 57:57.865
that causes problems,
but in our family

57:57.909 --> 58:00.868
it was the other way around.

58:00.955 --> 58:05.656
That must have been really hard
on you to deal with that.

58:05.743 --> 58:09.268
You know, for the most part,
we were a normal happy family.

58:09.355 --> 58:11.792
I mean, Jessie and I had
some great times together.

58:11.879 --> 58:15.361
It's just, sometimes she'd...

58:16.318 --> 58:17.842
lose it.

58:17.929 --> 58:19.104
Lose it?

58:20.105 --> 58:21.976
Yeah, she, uh,

58:22.063 --> 58:23.674
got into some fights.

58:25.719 --> 58:28.592
We actually, uh, had to put her

58:28.679 --> 58:30.855
into an institution.

58:30.942 --> 58:33.205
[chuckles]
A mental institution?

58:39.124 --> 58:41.735
It's over now.

58:41.822 --> 58:44.390
But I, I just don't wanna
talk about it.

58:44.477 --> 58:46.218
Yeah. Yeah. No.
Um, I'm sorry.

58:46.305 --> 58:48.307
I, I-I didn't mean to pry.

58:48.394 --> 58:51.615
No, you're not prying.
I mean, we're sisters.

58:54.226 --> 58:55.923
But I do have to go
to the bathroom.

58:55.967 --> 58:57.882
- Okay. Yeah.
- [laughing]

58:59.666 --> 59:01.276
Hey, uh, when you get back,
do you think

59:01.363 --> 59:02.539
we could do our nails again?

59:02.582 --> 59:04.192
Sure.
There's polish in my purse.

59:04.279 --> 59:05.150
- Okay.
- I'll just be a minute.

59:05.237 --> 59:06.412
All right.

59:07.152 --> 59:08.240
[door shuts]

59:17.554 --> 59:20.426
[toilet flushing]

59:22.471 --> 59:23.734
[door unlocks]

59:26.606 --> 59:28.826
That's my favorite.
Azure Sky, right?

59:28.913 --> 59:30.741
Yeah. Right.

59:35.049 --> 59:36.834
I actually have to go soon.

59:36.877 --> 59:38.531
I've been wanting to take these
classes at the community college

59:38.618 --> 59:40.577
and it's orientation tonight.

59:46.495 --> 59:47.801
[Skylar] Great, yeah.
[Michael] Thank you for those.

59:47.845 --> 59:48.976
[Skylar] Mm-hmm.
[Michael] Mm-hmm.

59:49.063 --> 59:52.110
So, um, so I had something

59:52.197 --> 59:54.068
that I wanted to discuss
with everyone.

59:55.113 --> 59:58.159
Mm-hmm. Like what?

59:58.246 --> 59:59.857
Okay, so you know
the third room,

59:59.944 --> 01:00:02.120
the guest room
that nobody ever uses?

01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:03.121
[Michael] Mm-hmm.

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.166
Well, what do you think

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.908
about turning that
into a room for Bree?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.917
Um, have you mentioned this
to Bree yet?

01:00:17.004 --> 01:00:21.226
No. Of course not. I wanted
us all to discuss it first.

01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:25.447
But, I mean, frankly, I thought
you'd be a little more excited.

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:29.234
Sky?

01:00:30.757 --> 01:00:32.629
Honey, I thought
you'd be thrilled.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.415
- Hey, mom.
- Yeah?

01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:38.635
What was grandma's name again?

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:41.507
Eleanor.

01:00:43.074 --> 01:00:46.338
Why? What made you
ask me about her?

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.427
Did, did Bree
say something to you?

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:51.735
She didn't. I mean, she didn't
tell me anything about them.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:00.657
So? What about the room?

01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:07.141
Not yet, mom. Okay?

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.969
Honey, did something happen
between the two of you

01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:10.797
that you wanna tell me?

01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:14.061
No, no. We're fine, mom.

01:01:14.148 --> 01:01:16.673
Bree's great.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.806
It's just, it's too soon.

01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:27.988
Well...

01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:34.081
It's been almost 20 years
for me.

01:01:34.168 --> 01:01:35.169
[Michael] Honey...

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:38.172
[laptop keys clacking]

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:46.311
[knocking on door]

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:47.529
What?

01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.361
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:55.537
Are you okay?

01:01:55.624 --> 01:01:57.017
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:01.718
I'm not the one in this family
who's completely lost it.

01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:04.721
Hey, come on.
Just cut her a break.

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:09.726
Look, you know, I like Bree.

01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:12.554
I like having her around.
She's cool.

01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:15.862
I just don't understand
why we have to pretend

01:02:15.949 --> 01:02:18.299
like all of a sudden
she's a part of this family,

01:02:18.343 --> 01:02:20.998
when she's obviously not.

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:23.870
I know. I know that.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:27.700
But just try to understand
how your mother feels.

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:31.443
This is very emotional for her.

01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:44.021
[sighs]

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:47.764
And I realize that you didn't
know about any of this.

01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:53.900
And what happened
all those years ago,

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:56.555
you know, giving up the baby,

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:58.470
it was extremely hard on her.

01:03:00.341 --> 01:03:02.866
- Yeah.
- I just want you to know.

01:03:02.953 --> 01:03:06.783
If you ever wanna talk,
I'm here for you.

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.437
Okay.

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:10.787
Thank you, dad.

01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:14.791
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.804
[sighs]

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:38.989
[dramatic music]

01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:08.426
[knocking on door]

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.174
[Elizabeth] Coming.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.354
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:25.443
I'm looking for Elizabeth Hogan.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.401
I'm Elizabeth Hogan.
Who are you?

01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:33.451
I'm Skylar.
Bree's half-sister.

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:37.934
- H-hi. Um...
- Hi.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.544
- Come in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:43.113
Sure. Of course. Um...

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:50.468
[dramatic music]

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:18.278
[doorbell ringing]

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:51.311
[music continues]

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.477
[door creaking]

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:54.722
[music continues]

01:08:02.817 --> 01:08:05.516
So, Skylar,
what can we do for you?

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:08.084
Um, like I said,
a few weeks ago,

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:10.086
your daughter Bree
showed up at our house.

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:14.264
She told us she was
my mother's biological daughter.

01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:16.831
Some agency helped her find us.

01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:19.399
- I told you something was up.
- No, you didn't.

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:21.444
I did. I thought
it was a new boyfriend.

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:22.750
You didn't think anything.

01:08:22.794 --> 01:08:24.229
Ignore this one.

01:08:24.317 --> 01:08:26.928
So she wasgone
more often than normal,

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:28.930
but, well, she probably
told you this as well.

01:08:29.017 --> 01:08:30.715
She's just been trying
to find herself.

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:33.587
Find herself.
That's what she told us. Yeah.

01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:35.459
She's thinking about what to do
with her future.

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:39.376
Yeah, but even when she was
home, she was perfectly happy.

01:08:39.462 --> 01:08:42.683
And she didn't
tell you guys anything

01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:45.991
about how
she was looking for us,

01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:48.819
that she found us?

01:08:48.907 --> 01:08:52.040
No. I mean, Bree's always been
a very private person.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.825
- Even as a kid, right?
- [Mr. Hogan] Yeah.

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:55.479
Yeah, I don't know
if that's just who she is

01:08:55.566 --> 01:08:57.394
or if it's just
a part of the adoption...

01:08:57.481 --> 01:09:00.397
Well, she was only a day old
when we adopted her.

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:02.573
I mean, she didn't even know she
was adopted for ten more years.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.531
I mean, what would that
have to do with anything?

01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:07.621
This one knows nothing
about child psychology.

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:09.841
So it's all true then?

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:12.104
You guys adopted her right away,

01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:14.975
the two of your raised her
in this house?

01:09:15.063 --> 01:09:17.805
Do you have any reason
to believe otherwise?

01:09:17.892 --> 01:09:19.894
I mean, there was one time
when in first grade

01:09:19.938 --> 01:09:21.069
where she stole something.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.375
- Right?
- Oh. [chuckles]

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.247
Besides that, she's always been

01:09:24.334 --> 01:09:27.554
a very, very honest child
and adult.

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:29.774
No, no. Uh...
We all love Bree.

01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:31.776
It's just that

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:34.474
I wanted to make sure that,

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.649
well, that everything was

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:39.261
what she said it was.

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:41.481
You know,
it was kind of a shock,

01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:43.743
her just showing up like that.

01:09:43.787 --> 01:09:47.921
Well, I imagine it was
pretty rough on her, as well.

01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.359
Yeah, no. Of course.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:55.191
So she still lives here
with you guys and her sister?

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:57.976
Well, uh, Jessie
doesn't live with us anymore.

01:09:58.063 --> 01:10:00.370
She hasn't for quite a while.

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:01.893
How much did she tell you
about her relationship

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.938
with her sister?

01:10:04.025 --> 01:10:07.072
Um, she, she said

01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:10.118
that she loves her

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.209
and, well, it was complicated.

01:10:13.296 --> 01:10:17.125
Well, Jessica thought
we favored Bree.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.520
Well, we actually may have
overcompensated.

01:10:20.607 --> 01:10:22.740
We were just, we were trying
to do the right thing.

01:10:25.351 --> 01:10:27.223
We never wanted Bree
to feel like she was anything

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:29.877
other than our actual daughter.

01:10:31.488 --> 01:10:33.272
But maybe we went too far.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:36.232
Oh, no.
We didn't go too far.

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:39.670
I mean, Jessie just needed to be
more understanding.

01:10:39.757 --> 01:10:42.673
Well, there's no such thing
as a perfect family, right?

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.501
No matter how hard you try.

01:10:44.588 --> 01:10:47.373
[chuckles]
That's for sure.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.288
But if it makes you guys
feel any better,

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:53.423
according to Bree, your family
was as close as it gets.

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:54.859
[door opens]

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:57.775
[dramatic music]

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.290
- Come on, Banks.
- [Bree] Hello, detective.

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:35.943
- [yells]
- [Holmes screams]

01:11:38.076 --> 01:11:40.470
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Yeah.

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:43.211
Ah. Are you sure I can't get you
something to eat?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.126
Oh, no. I'm okay.
Thank you.

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:49.000
Um, you know, actually, I should
probably start heading out.

01:11:49.087 --> 01:11:52.264
I didn't tell anyone
where I was going.

01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:54.135
[chuckles]
To be honest, I kinda felt

01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:56.094
a little bit silly
about coming here.

01:11:56.181 --> 01:11:58.226
No, do not feel silly at all.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:01.229
You are a very mature
and smart young lady.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:04.102
And I bet, your parents
are very proud of you.

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:07.453
You know what?
I think Bree's home.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:11.065
Oh. Uh, I didn't know
she was gonna be here.

01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:13.285
I didn't even think
of what I was gonna say.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.809
Well, don't worry about it.
It'll be fine.

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.811
- Yeah.
- I hope so.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.168
- [Elizabeth] Hi, honey.
- Hi.

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:29.040
Hi, I'm Bree.

01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:32.391
[Elizabeth] Wait.

01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:35.089
You-you don't know who she is?

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:37.309
I'm sorry.
Have we met somewhere before?

01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:38.789
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
What...

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:40.834
You wanna let us know
what's going on here?

01:12:42.488 --> 01:12:44.360
Who's this?

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:47.319
Uh, that's our daughter,
Jessica.

01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:51.018
I'm sorry, can somebody explain
to me what exactly is going on?

01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:55.022
Um... I'm sorry.

01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:57.721
- Uh...
- Wait. Wait, wait, what?

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:01.377
[dramatic music]

01:13:18.045 --> 01:13:20.918
[Bree sobbing]

01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:38.849
[sniffles]

01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:56.083
[sniffles]

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.042
[shuddering]

01:14:08.356 --> 01:14:09.749
[sniffles]

01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:16.147
[Laura] Sky?

01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:20.934
- [deep breathes]
- [Laura] Bree?

01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:26.418
Are you guys home?

01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:32.642
Sky?

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:37.342
Bree?

01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:42.652
Skylar?

01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:49.354
Guys?

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.491
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.673
[dramatic music]

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.902
- Come on.
- [line ringing]

01:15:15.989 --> 01:15:17.469
Come on, come on, come on.

01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:18.862
Come on, mom.

01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:20.603
- Hey, you've reached Laura...
- Mom...

01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:22.126
[Laura] Leave your name
and number after the beep

01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:23.257
and then text me and let me know

01:15:23.344 --> 01:15:24.737
you left me a voice mail.

01:15:24.824 --> 01:15:26.391
Mom, listen to me.

01:15:26.478 --> 01:15:28.001
Whatever you do,
do not let Bree into the house.

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:30.787
She's not who she says she is.
She's her sister.

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:34.051
Just trust me on this one. Don't
let her into the house, okay?

01:15:34.094 --> 01:15:35.487
Don't let her in.

01:15:42.755 --> 01:15:45.410
Oh. Mama's awake.

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:56.856
Please... you don't need
to do this.

01:15:56.943 --> 01:15:59.511
You have no idea what I need.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:00.947
None!

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:03.384
I am so, so sorry.

01:16:03.471 --> 01:16:06.387
I never ever wanted
to give you away.

01:16:06.474 --> 01:16:08.346
You have to believe that.

01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.739
You didn't give me away.

01:16:09.826 --> 01:16:12.916
No, I didn't. You're right.
They did.

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:15.483
My parents did that,
and-and then when they did that,

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:18.225
I-I never spoke to them again.

01:16:18.312 --> 01:16:21.925
You have no idea who I am,
do you?

01:16:23.491 --> 01:16:25.189
You're my daughter.

01:16:29.933 --> 01:16:33.763
I wanted to be. [sniffles]

01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:36.243
I wanted to see what it felt
like to have a mother

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:40.552
who'll love you unconditionally,
because I never had that.

01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:44.948
I don't understand. You, you
told me that they loved you.

01:16:44.991 --> 01:16:48.734
[sighs] They loved
their adopted daughter.

01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:52.564
Loved her until they had no more
love to give to anyone else.

01:16:54.174 --> 01:16:55.741
When something went wrong...

01:16:57.047 --> 01:16:59.658
who do you think they blamed?

01:16:59.745 --> 01:17:02.356
When one child
was chosen for something,

01:17:02.443 --> 01:17:04.097
who do you think they chose?

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:06.360
When opportunities
were to be had,

01:17:06.447 --> 01:17:08.972
who got them first?

01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:11.757
- Oh, my God.
- She did.

01:17:11.844 --> 01:17:14.760
You're not Bree.
You're not...

01:17:14.847 --> 01:17:16.980
And if it wasn't for you,

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:19.243
if it wasn't for you
giving her away,

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.985
I wouldn't have had to deal
with any of it.

01:17:22.072 --> 01:17:24.596
I would've had all the love from
both of my parents for myself.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:27.730
Bree, or whoever you are,
you have to believe me.

01:17:27.817 --> 01:17:29.296
- I, I didn't...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

01:17:29.383 --> 01:17:32.038
It was mommy and daddy.
They made you do it.

01:17:32.082 --> 01:17:33.953
Well, you know what?
I took care of that.

01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:38.915
But if you would've
kept your slutty,

01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:42.309
little teenage legs closed,

01:17:42.396 --> 01:17:44.181
we wouldn't be in this situation
in the first place.

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:46.531
Mom?

01:18:01.415 --> 01:18:02.547
Mom?

01:18:03.504 --> 01:18:04.680
Oh, no.

01:18:05.768 --> 01:18:07.465
Mom...

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:08.814
Oh, God.

01:18:09.989 --> 01:18:12.426
[Bree] You have to pay.

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:15.429
[sniffles] You have to pay
for everything

01:18:15.516 --> 01:18:16.996
that you did to me.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:19.477
You-you-you, you can't
d-do this. You can't...

01:18:19.564 --> 01:18:21.261
- Jessica!
- [gasping]

01:18:21.348 --> 01:18:23.786
Skylar! Run!

01:18:23.873 --> 01:18:25.526
It's too late, mom.

01:18:26.745 --> 01:18:28.704
Yeah, that's right.

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.010
After everything she did to you,
I couldn't just allow her

01:18:31.097 --> 01:18:32.838
to get away with it, could I?

01:18:35.188 --> 01:18:37.582
What are you talking about?

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:40.803
I was just at the Hogans' house.
Nice people.

01:18:44.197 --> 01:18:46.809
You're lying.

01:18:46.896 --> 01:18:50.247
There's a, there's a blue
wind chime with a starfish on it

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:51.770
outside the front door.

01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:54.381
Um, on, uh, on the mantel,

01:18:54.468 --> 01:18:57.254
there's pictures of you
and Bree on it, and happy.

01:18:57.341 --> 01:18:58.516
I'm sorry.

01:18:59.822 --> 01:19:02.215
It's too late.

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:04.740
- I can't go back.
- Skylar, run!

01:19:07.307 --> 01:19:08.744
Leave her alone!

01:19:08.831 --> 01:19:10.397
[both grunting]

01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:12.356
Sky!

01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:14.445
- [Laura] Don't hurt her!
- [Skylar grunting]

01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:16.882
Oh, God!
Please, leave her alone.

01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:18.536
Just leave her alone!

01:19:25.238 --> 01:19:26.370
- Mom...
- Go, baby, run.

01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:27.458
You can do it, yes, you can.

01:19:27.545 --> 01:19:29.677
You can.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:30.940
Look out! She's behind you!

01:19:31.027 --> 01:19:32.898
[grunting]

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:37.903
You should've stayed out of it.

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:39.905
No.

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:41.254
[grunting]

01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:46.912
Now you have to go.

01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:50.786
[groaning]

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.397
Get off of me!

01:19:53.484 --> 01:19:54.659
[Laura] Jessica.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:00.621
[grunting]

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.190
- Sky...
- [Skylar coughing]

01:20:04.277 --> 01:20:05.626
Sky, baby...

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:08.238
- Oh.
- Oh, baby.

01:20:08.325 --> 01:20:09.500
[Michael] Sky!

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:13.417
- Show me your hands!
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:20:13.504 --> 01:20:14.592
- Laura!
- Let's go!

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.028
That's her right there.
[panting]

01:20:16.115 --> 01:20:17.682
Guys. Oh, God.

01:20:17.769 --> 01:20:20.511
[dramatic music]

01:20:20.598 --> 01:20:23.079
You okay, guys? Let me see,
let me see, let me see.

01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:26.082
[breathing heavily] Oh, baby.

01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:27.431
- I'm sorry.
- You're okay.

01:20:27.518 --> 01:20:30.347
Honey, are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.479
- No. No, no, no...
- You have the right to remain...

01:20:32.566 --> 01:20:35.961
No! No! No... [sobbing]

01:20:36.048 --> 01:20:36.962
It's okay.

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:40.183
- Oh, guys.
- Laura!

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:42.533
[grunting] Laura!

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:45.188
- Get her out of here!
- It's okay, it's okay. Shh, shh!

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:48.365
Let me see. Oh, God, we gotta
get you to the hospital.

01:20:48.452 --> 01:20:50.976
Guys. Oh, oh, God...

01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:55.154
[Banks] It was on and off
for years.

01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:57.330
Ms. Hogan was institutionalized.

01:20:57.417 --> 01:21:00.768
And now she's back
where she belongs,

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.727
where she can't hurt anyone
ever again.

01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:07.514
Well, I'm so sorry
about your partner.

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:11.170
Thank you.

01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:12.868
I'll leave you all alone now.

01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:14.782
- Ms. Parker...
- Detective, thank you so much.

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.133
Please, get some rest
and heal up, okay?

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.830
I will.

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:20.092
I can't thank you enough,
detective.

01:21:20.136 --> 01:21:21.746
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

01:21:23.574 --> 01:21:25.968
- Who's hungry?
- I could use real food.

01:21:26.055 --> 01:21:29.275
Okay.
Well, I will be right back.

01:21:29.362 --> 01:21:32.670
- Anything but pizza. [chuckles]
- Oh, of course, yeah.

01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.759
- Thank you, honey.
- Love you, guys. [clears throat]

01:21:35.716 --> 01:21:37.240
- Mom.
- Yeah.

01:21:37.327 --> 01:21:41.113
There is someone
that we'd like you to meet

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.115
if, if you're up for it,
of course.

01:21:43.202 --> 01:21:44.551
Honey, I'm fine.

01:21:44.638 --> 01:21:46.162
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:21:46.249 --> 01:21:47.815
- I hate being stuck in this bed.
- Okay.

01:21:47.859 --> 01:21:50.340
- But I'm fine. Yeah.
- All right.

01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:53.909
Knock, knock.

01:21:55.693 --> 01:21:59.915
Uh, I have someone
I would like for you to meet.

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.918
Laura,
this is your daughter Bree.

01:22:09.576 --> 01:22:12.362
[chuckles] I wish
we could've met

01:22:12.449 --> 01:22:15.539
under better circumstances.

01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:21.284
I am so sorry.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.287
For what?

01:22:26.028 --> 01:22:30.032
You gave me... the best gift

01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:32.121
you possibly could have.

01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:35.951
A life.

01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:39.302
That is something that...

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.915
no matter what,
I will never forget.

01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:49.268
[sniffles]

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:54.970
[voice breaking]
It's really you.

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:56.580
You did this?

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:57.973
[chuckles]

01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:01.585
Come here.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.416
[both chuckling]

01:23:06.503 --> 01:23:07.591
[Ray] Good afternoon, everyone.

01:23:07.678 --> 01:23:09.636
As you know, I'm Dr. Ray

01:23:09.723 --> 01:23:11.987
and I'm here to help you.

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:13.858
I wanna be your friend.

01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:17.296
I want you to consider this
your safe space.

01:23:17.383 --> 01:23:20.778
You can tell me anything at all
that you'd like.

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:24.695
No one will judge you.
So why don't we start over here?

01:23:24.782 --> 01:23:27.480
Anybody wanna tell me anything
that's bothering them?

01:23:27.567 --> 01:23:29.569
Anything at all going on?

01:23:29.613 --> 01:23:32.311
How about over here? Anyone?

01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:34.183
Nothing? No one?

01:23:36.315 --> 01:23:39.101
What about you, Jess?
Would you like to join us?

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:43.061
Jess, honey,
there's an empty chair here.

01:23:43.105 --> 01:23:46.021
[intense music]

01:23:49.328 --> 01:23:50.895
[man] Bree, can you join us?

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:57.858
[chuckles] I'm Bree.

01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:07.999
[Jessica]
They didn't understand me.

01:24:09.348 --> 01:24:11.742
My next family will love me.

01:24:12.569 --> 01:24:13.744
I promise.

01:24:16.573 --> 01:24:17.791
I promise.

01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:20.751
[music intensifies]

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:26.017
[instrumental music]

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:58.963
[music continues]

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.996
[music continues]
