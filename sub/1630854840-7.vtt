WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:05.130
-Blue lid, thick milk.

00:05.213 --> 00:07.507
Green lid, runny milk.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.760
Red lid, devil's water.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.764
Are you going to keep doing that?

00:15.473 --> 00:16.474
It helps me learn.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.397
Fuckers! They don't want my eggs.
Why don't they want my eggs?

00:22.480 --> 00:25.233
-Are they in date?
-Yeah, by about 20 years, yeah.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.610
-Lady eggs.
-I need that money for the clinic.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.363
How dare they?
Now, these are prime-time eggs.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.283
I'll have to find something else
to monetise now.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.285
-What's monetise?

00:35.827 --> 00:38.621
It's when you take something
you're good at, like a skill or a talent,

00:38.705 --> 00:40.832
and you make people give you money for it.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.129
Do you have any skills?

00:47.630 --> 00:49.174
-No.
-Do you have any talents?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.551
-No.
-So what's the point of you?

00:51.634 --> 00:53.303
-Jesus Christ!
-It's okay.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.804
I don't have any skills either.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.890
At least, not as a man.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.538
Okay, take two.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.123
Time for our next mission.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.292
I mean, sequels are always
better anyway, right?

01:24.375 --> 01:27.003
There's <i>Terminator 2…</i>

01:27.712 --> 01:29.506
Uh…

01:29.589 --> 01:31.007
So what's the plan?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.135
-Um…
-You do have a plan, don't you?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.888
Y-You've had so much time
to think about this exact situation.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.849
Gregor was full of plans.
Fucking do this, do that.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.435
He was planning to foil
some big drug deal.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.145
Organised crime kind of shit.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.481
-Well, how'd he get that kind of intel?
-I told him.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.818
-I-I do a bit of crime on the side.
-Then why are you doing this?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.945
I don't know.
They cancel each other out, don't they?

01:52.028 --> 01:55.406
Shit! We should be the ones
foiling drug gangs.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.284
It sounds so cool.
And, like, good for the community.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.289
I'm just looking for my hairdryer.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.875
Don't let me interrupt your hero'ing.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.379
All right, Seb.
I want you to case the joint, okay?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.465
-Entrances, exits.
-Actually, I think it's in the--

02:12.549 --> 02:15.802
-Oh.
-Randall, what weaponry are we facing?

02:16.344 --> 02:19.139
-Uh…
-Where are you, little hairdryer?

02:19.222 --> 02:22.517
Guns, knives, knuckle-dusters, shivs.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.310
This isn't a knockabout in the park, lads.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.980
Found it! Where is the diffuser?

02:30.275 --> 02:33.319
Right.
This is our moment, our destiny manifest.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.821
Okay, we may not all make it.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.739
Especially Seb.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.534
Okay, but if we perish,
we perish for a noble--

02:43.329 --> 02:45.665
Babe! Babe!

02:46.499 --> 02:48.334
Sorry, could you do that in the kitchen?

02:50.378 --> 02:52.046
-It's my bedroom too.
-Well, I know.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.840
You're just as important to me
as they are.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.467
You don't act like it. Last time,
it was like you forgot I existed.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.304
That won't happen this time.
I can do both, I swear.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.349
Now let's have a date night. Yeah?
Just you and me.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.604
-That sounds nice.
-Saturday night?

03:12.525 --> 03:15.236
So, when's this drug deal happening?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.738
Saturday night.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.996
Bloody ridiculous.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.124
I miss the days when you didn't have
to go through all this red tape.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.209
Oh, just get him.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.054
Your Majesty. I'm a, uh, biographer,

03:41.137 --> 03:44.807
and, uh, I'm trying to rehabilitate
your reputation as a statesman,

03:44.891 --> 03:49.229
and dispel the rumours that you wasted
your time partying and-- and womanising.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.731
Well, of course,
that's utter nonsense.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.024
Thank you, Your Highness.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.903
I wouldn't call that time wasted.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.405
Right.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.366
-I just need your signature on the--
-Tell me,

04:01.449 --> 04:03.159
who am I speaking through?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.453
It doesn't matter.
Just, uh, pretend she's not here.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.206
I may be dead, but that's no excuse
not to be a gentleman.

04:08.873 --> 04:12.502
Tell me, what is your name, milady?

04:15.880 --> 04:19.425
Carrie. It's nice to meet you, sir.
Your Eminence.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.555
That's not
how you address royalty.

04:25.473 --> 04:29.143
Now, Carrie,
what's a choice insult from your time?

04:29.227 --> 04:31.813
I like "twat," personally.

04:31.896 --> 04:32.981
Excellent.

04:33.064 --> 04:38.444
Tell this twat I shan't sign his accord
until he gives you a grovelling apology.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.904
And please…

04:42.198 --> 04:43.533
call me Charles.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.902
Yes?

05:25.116 --> 05:28.494
Um, very sorry to bother you
again. I-I just wanted to check in--

05:28.578 --> 05:32.790
Double-check that you were happy
with your experience with us yesterday.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.335
Ooh, I was.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.419
Good.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.548
Is there anything else
you want to say?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.595
And he storms into the court.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.847
All the high lords and ladies
of the land are there,

05:47.930 --> 05:54.145
and he says,
"Sir, you have sullied my virtuous wife."

05:54.228 --> 05:56.898
What did you do?

05:56.981 --> 06:02.320
I said, "Well, I look forward
to meeting your virtuous wife,"

06:02.403 --> 06:04.405
and arrested him for bigamy.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.577
Have you a looking glass?

06:09.660 --> 06:10.495
Yes.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.121
Can I see you?

06:18.586 --> 06:21.506
Just to warn you,
I'm not wearing any makeup.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.888
You're not saying anything.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.941
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds lovely.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.527
It's Molière.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.030
I'm not doing anything.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.366
Okay. Can I borrow you?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.828
You used to be a cat.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.789
You used to win cat shows as a cat.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.333
Cat shows have prize money.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.504
We compete in a cat show.
We win. We get money.

07:02.088 --> 07:06.384
As you can see, the maths works out.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.722
Yeah, um, one-- one small issue.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.642
I'm not a cat.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.726
Ah, I've anticipated this.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.105
I've done some digging, and apparently,

07:19.188 --> 07:21.899
with shape-shifters,
if you want to turn into your animal,

07:21.983 --> 07:23.734
you bring back some
of their sense memories.

07:23.818 --> 07:28.823
So, smell, touch, taste.
People on the Internet swear by it.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.033
-Okay.
-I-It'll work. Don't worry.

07:31.117 --> 07:35.371
That's a bit what I'm afraid of.
I don't think I want to be a cat again.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.789
Well, it's just for one day.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.667
Yeah, but w-what if I can't change back?
What if I get stuck?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.003
We don't have to do it.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.629
Right?

07:48.384 --> 07:49.886
No, we don't.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.014
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.308
It's not your fault.
It's way too much to ask.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.643
-Have you got a back-up plan?
-I…

07:58.978 --> 08:01.272
-No.
-You could always save up.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.523
That'll take years.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.944
No, I just feel like I can't start
until I have my power, you know?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.696
Have you tried selling your eggs?

08:08.779 --> 08:09.822
They don't want them!

08:09.906 --> 08:10.781
What?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.909
Those are prime-time eggs.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.035
I know!

08:19.790 --> 08:20.791
Hey.

08:21.459 --> 08:25.713
So, I thought we could
turn date night into date day.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.548
I think the galleries are open late today.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.676
So…

08:30.760 --> 08:32.136
I knew this would happen.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.388
No, I just have a tiny, little,
baby mission.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.307
But it won't affect our date, I promise.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.226
I'll be done by, like, 8.00 at the latest.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.603
Okay.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.192
Well, uh, don't let me ruin your plans.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.110
I'm sure you'll find someone
to go with you.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.247
What the fuck?
I thought he didn't want to do it.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.628
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

09:05.711 --> 09:07.547
<i>I've taken the cat food.</i>

09:07.630 --> 09:11.634
<i>Don't try and argue with me.</i>
<i>I want you to take me to the cat show.</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:13.344
<i>Oh, and scratch me behind the ears.</i>

09:13.427 --> 09:14.637
<i>I like that.</i>

09:16.472 --> 09:17.640
What do I do?

09:17.723 --> 09:19.559
I think we should honour his wishes.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.758
I would like to register my cat.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.345
-Name?
-Jizzlor-- Uh, Hercule.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.306
Just Hercule.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.266
The Hercule?

10:00.808 --> 10:01.976
Yes?

10:02.893 --> 10:05.646
Donna, Hercule's back.

10:06.355 --> 10:07.315
Donna!

10:07.398 --> 10:10.109
Oh, fucking yes!

10:11.485 --> 10:14.322
Sorry, sorry. This is just very exciting.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.907
We didn't know what happened to him
after David died.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.577
So, uh, how were you related to him?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.787
He was very specific in his will

10:21.871 --> 10:25.082
that he wanted Hercule
to go to his next of kin.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.295
I am his next of kin.
Yeah. I-I am his aunt.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.755
Oh.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.007
The aunt that collects Bigfoot erotica?

10:33.799 --> 10:36.510
-Um…
-Or the aunt that thinks Israel did 9/11?

10:38.262 --> 10:40.348
It's gonna have to be
the first one, isn't it?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.974
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

10:43.768 --> 10:47.480
Oh, sorry, almost forgot.
Um, what talent am I putting you down for?

10:47.563 --> 10:50.399
-Talent?
-Yeah, for the talent segment.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.278
I mean, I know it's gonna be dance,
but I have to ask.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.738
Uh, I'm sorry. Did you say dance?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.657
Mm-hmm.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.117
<i>That cat can dance!</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:02.244
<i>Now, Sean,</i>
<i>I'd hate to have to follow that!</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.413
<i>Oh, Mike, I'd just kill myself.</i>

11:04.497 --> 11:07.166
-<i>Oh, come on!</i>
-Well, shit.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.984
Do you think there will be press?
Like, local news and stuff?

11:34.652 --> 11:37.697
Maybe. They might wanna take
a picture of us with the drugs,

11:37.780 --> 11:39.782
like when people catch a really big fish.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.701
I should have brought some dry shampoo.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.411
I get really sweaty in this suit.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.913
-I don't wanna look oily.
-All clear. No drugs in here.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.553
-What are you doing here?
-You're early!

12:00.636 --> 12:01.929
Oh, okay.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.014
You couldn't think of your own mission,
so you had to steal mine?

12:04.098 --> 12:06.308
-I don't see your name on it.
-"I don't see your name on it."

12:06.392 --> 12:09.437
-Grow up.
-No! It's my crime. I backsie it.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.522
You can't backsie it. I called it.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.321
Still want it?

12:19.405 --> 12:20.406
Yeah.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.453
Sorry, but can anyone else hear footsteps?

12:27.329 --> 12:28.581
Bloody hell.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.665
Ha!

12:30.249 --> 12:32.501
Someone's coming. Alpha team, hide.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.045
Shit!

12:42.261 --> 12:43.512
Move!

12:44.805 --> 12:46.182
Hello?

12:47.183 --> 12:48.768
-Oh.
-Hi.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.271
Um, so, do you usually compete in Ireland?

12:52.354 --> 12:55.858
'Cause I don't remember seeing you
at the southeast Fancy Lad regionals.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.152
-Oh, no, this is my first time.
-Ever?

12:58.235 --> 13:01.363
Yeah. I'm just here
for the prize money, really.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.742
But, I mean, come on.
It's not like you need experience.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.452
Just cats, isn't it?

13:09.079 --> 13:11.665
I bet you think you're hot shit,
don't you?

13:11.749 --> 13:12.583
What?

13:12.666 --> 13:16.796
I've seen thousands of girls like you
come and go.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.881
You're nothing special.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.550
Best go home now
before you embarrass your cat.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.323
Oops.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.296
Oh, my God. What a psycho, right?

14:00.673 --> 14:03.634
What is it about Bigfoot?
Is it just the big, hairy penis?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.178
Yeah.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.304
Hmm.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.350
Ugh.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.103
Well, w-we don't need to talk.

14:14.186 --> 14:18.023
Dance is the language of the body.
It's instinctual. It's all muscle memory.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.484
We've got this.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.320
It's on the eight count. Eight.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.365
Not seven, not six. The eight count.

14:26.448 --> 14:27.449
It's very simple.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.702
Okay, let's start
with the simplest possible thing.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.455
Just sit, okay? You can do that. Just sit.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.833
Sit.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.087
Sit. Sit.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.173
Sit. Sit. Sit!

14:43.257 --> 14:47.136
Sit! Sit! Sit!

14:56.979 --> 14:59.231
This foiling isn't big enough
for the both of us.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.901
I completely agree. Fuck off then.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.194
-Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
-Neither am I.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.322
I guess we'll be staying here
until one of us gives in.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.489
Fine by me.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.326
Oh, my God. Kiss.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.372
I'm sorry. I write a lot of fan fiction.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.512
Okay.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.599
It says it should be…

15:39.813 --> 15:40.898
Here.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.526
Oh, no. This one is mortifying.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.779
It's a bad angle.
I told them to destroy it.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.364
Oh, I like it.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.575
Do you have a lover?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.955
I think so. I have a boyfriend.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.873
What does he make
of the Dutch masters?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.501
He's, uh,
not a gallery kind of guy.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.795
-Where does he take you?
-Uh…

16:02.878 --> 16:06.090
Usually we just stay in
and order some food.

16:06.173 --> 16:07.174
A crime.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.177
If I were him,
I would show you the continent.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.848
Have you ever been
to Tuscany in the springtime?

16:15.975 --> 16:16.976
N-No.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.687
I would take you boating
along the Arno.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.147
Oh.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.693
And we would discuss poetry
long into the evening.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.946
And then?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.449
And then to bed.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.328
Oi!

16:37.997 --> 16:39.164
The fuck are you doing?

16:42.626 --> 16:44.586
Step, turn. Not turn, turn, step.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.631
-Let's go from the top, yeah? All right.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.552
Five, six, seven, eight.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.223
Okay.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.309
-Now you listen here.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.687
I need this money.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.481
I need you to understand me right now.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.900
I need you to give me a sign
that you're still in there.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.194
Jizzlord, please.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.907
Now you're just being
an obtuse little cunt!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.701
I can't believe I ever showed you my tits.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.499
I'll just mark you down as a one
for welfare.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.355
It's close to 9.30.
I drop off to Brixton by 10.00.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.734
Yeah, he just loaded up the last one.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.530
Why can't we just work with them?

17:54.406 --> 17:58.327
Surely, as long as we stop the crime,
i-it doesn't matter who gets the glory.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.789
Yes. Yes, it does. Me. I want the glory!

18:01.872 --> 18:03.540
This might be my only chance.

18:03.624 --> 18:08.087
There will be other crimes.
This one doesn't even seem that serious.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.840
-Hey, look what I found.
-Oh, my God. Put them down.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.052
Oh, no.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.893
-You in a rush or something?
-No, it's nothing. It's just date night.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Time with your missus is not nothing.

18:25.729 --> 18:26.939
No, I know that.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.817
Why can't he just back down?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.319
Or you could back down.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.988
No! This is everything I've ever wanted.

18:35.072 --> 18:38.617
Taking down bad guys.
Being a hero. Saving the day.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.412
Yeah. If he has to ruin his relationship
with his girlfriend to do it,

18:43.080 --> 18:45.666
-then so be it.
-It's not what I meant.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.585
-Do you think your girlfriend will be mad?
-Not mad.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.672
Maybe just disappointed.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.590
-Oh, disappointed is way worse than mad.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.259
Trust me, if a guy did that to me,

18:55.342 --> 18:57.177
-it would be game over.
-Jesus Christ.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.720
I know. I don't want that.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.014
But I'm not leaving here
till I've saved something.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.309
It sounds like you do have something
to save, mate.

19:05.018 --> 19:09.314
Hey, Kash. This is stupid.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.608
Somewhere in this building,
criminals are doing something criminal,

19:11.692 --> 19:13.527
and here we are, arguing in a cupboard.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.114
Who's stepping aside? You or me?

19:34.173 --> 19:37.676
I'm getting black cherry.
Plum, perhaps.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.138
Should we be cheeky
and open the Merlot?

19:41.221 --> 19:46.059
I thought you said you had
an engagement with your beau. Hmm?

19:47.811 --> 19:49.646
He was never gonna show up.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.356
He's a fool.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.158
Perhaps it's not meant to be.

20:01.241 --> 20:04.661
No, no, it is.
We've been together since university.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.623
He seems as familiar to you
as an old coat.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.919
Just because something is well-worn

20:12.002 --> 20:16.506
doesn't necessarily mean
it is well-fitting. Hmm?

20:19.301 --> 20:22.471
Come on. Please. I need you.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.764
I need you you.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.184
If you were here,
you'd know the right things to say.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.896
What am I talking about? No, you wouldn't.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.483
You'd say something really weird,
and probably a little gross,

20:34.566 --> 20:37.611
but I think I'd quite like that right now.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.530
Let's just go home.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.866
Donna's right. We're never gonna win.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.374
I'm just gonna quickly
steal everything first.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.049
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

20:59.132 --> 21:00.926
<i>I've taken the cat food.</i>

21:01.009 --> 21:04.930
<i>Don't try and argue with me.</i>
<i>I want you to take me to the cat show.</i>

21:05.013 --> 21:06.640
<i>Oh, and scratch me behind the ears.</i>

21:06.723 --> 21:07.891
<i>I like that.</i>

21:08.684 --> 21:12.896
<i>Um, I didn't want to turn</i>
<i>back into Hercule when you asked,</i>

21:12.980 --> 21:17.150
<i>because I really like my life now.</i>

21:17.901 --> 21:19.861
<i>I know I should be trying</i>
<i>to find out who I was,</i>

21:19.945 --> 21:23.615
<i>but I'd rather stay with you.</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:28.495
<i>I know what it's like to feel like</i>
<i>something's missing from you.</i>

21:28.578 --> 21:30.664
<i>And I don't want you to feel that way.</i>

21:30.747 --> 21:33.959
<i>And you won't have to</i>
<i>because we're gonna win.</i>

21:34.042 --> 21:36.044
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

21:36.128 --> 21:37.129
<i>Uh, bye.</i>

21:49.641 --> 21:50.809
-<i>Jennifer?</i>
-Ange.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.520
-<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>
-Yeah, I know we're about to close.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.522
You know those costumes
that we were going to throw out

21:55.605 --> 21:57.190
because, legally, they were too flammable?

21:57.274 --> 21:58.942
<i>Yeah, the one with the sequins?</i>

21:59.026 --> 22:00.319
Do we still have those?

22:01.486 --> 22:04.489
I think that's
probably enough wine.

22:05.991 --> 22:10.746
I will not have
such treasonous language in my court.

22:11.913 --> 22:16.543
I'm so sorry, Your Highness.

22:16.626 --> 22:21.840
You ought to watch your tongue,
or I'll have you put over my knee.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.031
You wouldn't dare…

22:46.114 --> 22:47.407
-Carrie!
-Kash?

22:50.035 --> 22:51.370
Kash?

22:52.662 --> 22:54.748
I'm here. And I'm done with it.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.167
All of it. I'm done with it.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.835
Oh.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.349
-What are you wearing?
-Uh…

23:14.309 --> 23:15.519
I like it.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.314
Shall we have this date?

23:19.398 --> 23:22.025
I should like that very much.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.026
Sick.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.279
What takeaway do you want?

23:27.906 --> 23:29.783
Now, I know we normally get pizza,

23:29.866 --> 23:32.911
but apparently, the Chinese
has started doing sweet potato wedges,

23:32.994 --> 23:35.914
which is like, I mean, game changer.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.082
That's insane.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.044
Oh, what TV do you wanna watch?

23:42.879 --> 23:43.880
No.

23:45.173 --> 23:47.092
Sorry, this is a really important night.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.845
Let's do a YouTube deep dive.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.180
I've been recommended
these skateboarding-accident compilations

23:52.264 --> 23:53.515
which are meant to be…

23:57.227 --> 23:58.395
Yeah?

23:58.478 --> 23:59.563
Wonderful.

23:59.646 --> 24:02.149
Let's hear it for Frida Cat-lo.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.113
You're up.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.532
Don't fuck it up.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.414
That prize money is ours.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.668
It's you and me. Ride or die.

24:22.335 --> 24:25.172
Jennifer and Hercule!

24:50.280 --> 24:53.575
Boo! What are you doing? Boo!

26:26.918 --> 26:28.169
My eyes!

26:40.724 --> 26:41.725
No.

26:41.808 --> 26:42.809
Yeah, fair enough.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.279
<i>Yo, watch out. Watch out!</i>

26:57.449 --> 26:58.450
You want some?

27:00.076 --> 27:01.286
Oh, no.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.788
-I've missed this.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.124
It's nice getting back
to normal, isn't it?

27:09.669 --> 27:10.670
Isn't it?

27:12.631 --> 27:13.757
You're not saying anything.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.968
Oh, no. No!

27:20.263 --> 27:22.891
I'm sorry. I really messed it up.
You must be so mad at me.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.185
And now you don't have the money,
and so you're not going to--
