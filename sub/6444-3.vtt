00:07.080 --> 00:08.877
Take out your key.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.758
You're out of your mind.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.952
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.393
Look, just take out your key.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.154
- No. No.
- Do it!

00:36.200 --> 00:37.872
Tom.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.150
- No.
- You know what to do.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.151
Don't do it, Tom.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.399
- I'll kill him.
- Don't listen to him.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.350
We can't let this happen.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.315
Tom, no!

00:56.480 --> 00:58.789
On three.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.794
- One, two, three.
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

01:06.040 --> 01:07.996
I'm sorry.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.399
Hey, Gabriel. I'm surprised MIT
even lets you converse...

01:24.560 --> 01:26.790
...with us pedestrian
Met-Uers so early.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.589
- <i>Chloe, you have to get out of town.</i>
- I've been trying since yesterday.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.150
I had no idea "just the necessities"
would take so long to pack.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.312
Listen to me, Chloe.
Pretty soon, it's all gonna be over.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.038
I know it sucks to say goodbye.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.714
But if Smallville managed
without their cyberwizard...

01:41.880 --> 01:44.440
<i>...I'm</i> sure they'll survive
without their star reporter.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.639
Chloe, you're the one person
who will understand why I had to do it.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.238
<i>You have to make people realize</i>
<i>it wasn 't my choice.</i>

01:53.160 --> 01:54.479
It's the only way.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.156
Gabriel, what are you talking about?

01:57.360 --> 02:01.239
How much time did I spend at the <i>Torch</i>
helping you chase the big story?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.514
<i>In one hour,</i>
<i>you're finally gonna get it.</i>

02:04.680 --> 02:06.591
What happens in an hour?

02:08.360 --> 02:11.432
Smallville's finally
gonna be gone forever.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.559
<i>DEFCON 1. Countdown commencing.</i>

03:45.760 --> 03:47.159
Hi.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.593
Hi.

03:53.080 --> 03:56.629
That was the best night's sleep
I've had in weeks.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.514
<i>Thanks for listening.</i>
<i>It's just about 6:30 on a sunny...</i>

04:03.680 --> 04:05.955
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.355
How did we fall asleep?

04:07.520 --> 04:09.431
I told you we should've
gone to the Talon.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.357
How can that hurt so much?

04:14.520 --> 04:17.432
All right, look. Okay, my dad's
not gonna be up for 15 minutes.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.194
Then we gotta get out of here.
You gotta get out of here.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.510
Sticking around
for breakfast sounds like fun.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.755
What?

04:26.080 --> 04:29.629
Pass me my shoe.
"We won't fall asleep, I promise."

04:29.800 --> 04:32.234
What else are we gonna do
at 2:00 in the morning?

04:32.400 --> 04:34.789
- Look, you're not mad, are you?
- I'm furious.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.398
Come on.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.797
Hey, Clark, what...?

04:56.800 --> 04:58.916
Mr. And Mrs. Kent.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.874
I can explain.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.996
Clark and I made
this decision together...

05:07.160 --> 05:11.631
<i>...so</i> if you're angry,
you should be angry at both of us.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.159
We... We're not mad.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.630
It... But this is an...

05:18.840 --> 05:20.068
You're <i>both...</i>

05:21.360 --> 05:24.193
...in new territory.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.152
Lana, this is about a whole lot
more than just you.

05:31.320 --> 05:35.074
So if you don't mind, I'd like
to speak to my son alone, please.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.990
You sit down.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.993
Just... Just remember, I am 18.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.119
I've been in love with Lana since I was 7,
so it's not like we rushed into something.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.431
Please tell me you were at least safe.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.349
- Yeah, Mom.
- Safe?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.158
Safe has got nothing
to do with this.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.039
You shouldn't be doing anything
like this under our roof.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.077
- Like you didn't do it?
- Clark.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.435
There's a lot of conversations
we didn't have.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.398
- I didn't think we needed to.
- You guys think I'm not normal.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.471
No, no. It... It...
It's just that...

06:23.640 --> 06:25.551
You're just so much
more vulnerable now...

06:25.760 --> 06:27.239
...without your powers.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.799
Knock, knock.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.996
Okay, I just passed Lana
flying out of here.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.835
What would she be doing here
at 6:30 in...?

06:40.080 --> 06:45.518
So, chloe, clark said you're...
You're off to Met U today.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.240
Looks like you're getting an early start.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.869
Not without one last
"why me?" moment, though.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.235
I got a cryptic call
from Gabriel Duncan.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.793
The tech guy from the <i>Torch?</i>

06:56.000 --> 06:58.195
Yeah, well, I guess
today's my lucky <i>day...</i>

06:58.400 --> 07:01.119
...because he said that Smallville
is going to be history...

07:01.280 --> 07:04.477
...in exactly 53 minutes.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.989
Have you spoken to Sheriff Adams
about this, Chloe?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.514
I think I've used up my limit
of "cry wolfs" with her.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.876
Why don't you find Gabriel.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.349
I'll speak to the sheriff myself.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.556
Early morning or late night?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.154
What the hell are you doing here?

07:41.520 --> 07:43.715
I've been admiring your sketches.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.395
I didn't mean to pry.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.312
No, of course not.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.358
You were just going through my things
to get better acquainted.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.239
- You can't just come in here.
- I didn't mean to rattle you.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.039
There was no answer,
so I started to get concerned.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.037
Lex, I'm fine.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.915
Are you sure about that?

08:06.480 --> 08:09.517
Look, I just wanna talk about
what you saw that day.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.274
Weren't you the person who told me
I was hallucinating...

08:12.440 --> 08:15.034
...last time I mentioned a spaceship?

08:15.960 --> 08:17.439
Lana...

08:17.880 --> 08:21.156
...I might have appeared skeptical,
but I still believed in you.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.237
That's why I sent
an expert to the site.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.358
Whatever caused that crater
was not a meteor.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.269
Have you talked
to anyone else about this?

08:32.440 --> 08:33.759
Like Clark?

08:36.840 --> 08:40.799
You know, when you start rambling
about spaceships and aliens...

08:40.960 --> 08:43.428
...people kind of look at you funny.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.872
Well, they must not have
the same faith in you that I do.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.757
You're not crazy.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.314
Sheriff Adams,
can I speak to you for a minute?

09:04.480 --> 09:07.074
It's nothing to worry about.
It's just a routine drill.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.356
It's a routine drill
at the Hamstead farm, huh?

09:09.520 --> 09:10.748
What...?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.037
Wouldn't have anything to do
with the missile silo in their field?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.270
Why don't you go on
back to your truck.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.040
It's no secret the government
put these things out here.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.077
I just thought
they decommissioned them.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.670
Mr. Kent, thank you, we've got it
all under control. Thank you very much.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.469
Why don't you just relax, sir,
and let us do our job.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.674
Officers can stand down.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.194
There isn't even a missile in here.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.952
This is a false alarm.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.394
Not exactly.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.199
That signal did not come from
in here. It was rerouted.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.352
There are at least 15 silos
that are still active in the county.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.033
He could be in any one of them.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.992
<i>Missile tracking unlocked. Enter revised</i>
<i>coordinates for new point of impact.</i>

10:47.640 --> 10:49.312
Gabriel.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.396
It's locked.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.118
We call it "plan B."

10:56.280 --> 10:59.989
It's for those of us who can't
crush metal with our bare hands.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.838
Hello.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.035
Gabriel? Colonel Duncan?
Is anybody here?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.152
Find anything?

11:23.880 --> 11:27.555
Does the fact that Gabriel's father was
a not-so-retired military colonel count?

11:27.720 --> 11:29.790
These briefs are only a few weeks old.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.959
A colonel with an aerospace
engineering degree from Purdue?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.474
Do you think that he might be
the lighthouse keeper...

11:40.640 --> 11:42.312
...for the local nuclear missiles?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.351
Wall of Weird times 100.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.476
Well, looks like Gabriel was giving you
a run for your money.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.950
Yeah, I'd say he lapped me
a few times.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.351
Why would he be so obsessed
with meteor freaks?

12:06.520 --> 12:09.239
Oh, come on.
Now, journalistic curiosity is one thing...

12:09.400 --> 12:12.836
...but papier-mâchéing your walls
with them is another.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.753
Call me conventional, but shouldn't this
have been a red flag for Gabriel's dad?

12:18.200 --> 12:21.795
I just... If Gabriel was so determined
to go atomic on the meteor epidemic...

12:21.960 --> 12:23.518
<i>...why</i> didn't his dad stop him?

12:23.680 --> 12:25.557
Looks like he tried.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.679
I expected results by now.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.432
- Mr. Luthor...
- Why isn't this open?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.511
That laser uses technology
so cutting edge...

12:52.680 --> 12:55.240
<i>...even</i> the military doesn't
know about it. We've tried.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.516
Luthorcorp doesn't believe
in finite solutions.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.318
I'm not sure you understand, sir.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.710
We've used every
chemical compound that exists.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.110
Every alloy of metal,
every method known to man.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.477
Which would clearly suggest
that this craft isn't known to man.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.713
So I recommend you and your team
start thinking out of the box.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.111
- I'm... I'm trying to explain...
- For every question, there is an answer.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.995
Now, if you find
that task too challenging...

13:18.160 --> 13:20.594
<i>...I'll</i> recruit someone who doesn't.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.111
Find a way in.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.192
Wait.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.110
I didn't see this before.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.031
That's because it wasn't there.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.480
I don't know how they'll check
15 silos in 40 minutes.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.155
Well, neither can you anymore, Clark,
if that's what you're thinking.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.909
- It's rough being regular flesh and blood.
- Never stopped you.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.872
Of all the people in Smallville,
you're the only one he warned.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.869
- He just wants me to tell his story.
- Either way, he trusts you.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.793
Maybe we don't need
to search every silo.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.038
- Hello.
- <i>Gabriel. Hi, l... I need your help.</i>

14:09.200 --> 14:12.431
I started to leave town, then I was
freaked out when I was driving.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.398
And then this dog
ran out on the road and l...

14:15.560 --> 14:17.232
Chloe, slow down. What happened?

14:17.400 --> 14:20.949
L... I guess I must have overcorrected,
and I ran my car into a ditch.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.396
And I can't get it started now.
I'm really scared.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.516
- Can you help me?
- Where are you?

14:26.720 --> 14:29.598
<i>Route 87, near the old mill.</i>

14:31.800 --> 14:34.951
Okay, just hang on.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.278
Tell me what the symbols mean.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.439
I'm not buying it, Dad.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.231
You're in there.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.591
You've been obsessively
drawing these for weeks.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.955
They're identical
to the markings on the ship.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.956
You'll never open it.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.710
Only he can open it.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.595
Gabriel, I'm sorry.
Everything happened so fast.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.274
- I didn't know who to call.
- It's all right. Come with me.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.317
- You'll be safe there.
- Gabriel.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.030
Which silos did you activate?

15:34.840 --> 15:36.558
I trusted you.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.638
Whatever your reasons for doing this,
killing's not the answer.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.151
You're wrong, clark.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.117
It's the only answer.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.708
Clark! Clark! No!

15:48.880 --> 15:51.713
- You can't just leave him, he's gonna die!
- Don't fight me.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.711
- Clark! No!
- Chloe, you have to trust me!

15:53.880 --> 15:55.154
No!

16:20.000 --> 16:21.911
Farmer heard the shot
and found him on 87.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.593
Male, 18, gunshot wound to chest.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.478
Massive bleeding.
Vitals are unstable.

16:25.640 --> 16:28.677
We need to intubate now.
Prep him for the OR immediately.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.318
- Clark?
- How serious is it, doc?

16:34.480 --> 16:37.870
Can't tell until I open him up.
It looks like the bullet pierced his lung.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.076
- Bullet?
- Sorry, I'm gonna have to ask <i>you...</i>

16:40.240 --> 16:41.992
...to stay in the waiting area.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.397
Gabriel, Clark could die out there.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.070
In 20 minutes none of it
will matter, Chloe.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.268
<i>Missile trajectory locked.</i>

17:06.440 --> 17:08.907
<i>Latitude 37 north.</i>

17:09.079 --> 17:11.275
You're gonna kill
everyone in Smallville.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.317
How could you do that?

17:13.480 --> 17:15.630
It's not that difficult.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.800
The fail-safes were programmed
back in 1979.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.155
It only takes a moderate genius
to bypass them.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.675
You don't watch your dad
do the same drill for 10 years...

17:23.839 --> 17:25.558
...and not pick up a thing or two.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.036
Don't look at me like that, chloe.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.157
You're safe here, okay?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.833
With me.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.753
Besides, you're getting
what you always wanted.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.592
The story of a lifetime.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.876
You actually think
I care about that right now?

17:50.080 --> 17:51.957
You should care.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.317
The last meteor shower left 10 times
as much rock to infect people...

17:55.480 --> 17:56.799
...than the last one.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.350
Pretty soon, there's gonna be
more psychos running around this town.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.590
This is the only way to end it.

18:07.360 --> 18:10.432
It's my one chance to be a hero.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.996
So you're exterminating
a few meteor freaks...

18:15.160 --> 18:17.799
...by sacrificing
the lives of innocent people?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.791
Innocent?

18:19.960 --> 18:24.033
Every single one of those mutants
was innocent before the meteor showers.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.316
My dad warned me
to stay away from the rocks...

18:26.480 --> 18:29.313
...because they turned
people into mutants.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.111
Your dad?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.834
Were those his articles
on the wall?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.550
He tried to warn people.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.473
He said the meteors were
destroying the town.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.836
No one would listen.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.196
Then during the last one...

18:49.600 --> 18:51.670
...he became one of them.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.596
You know, a lot of people think
special abilities are a gift.

18:57.160 --> 19:01.233
You didn't have to kill him
just because he wasn't normal anymore.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.157
He asked me to.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.476
No one wants to live like that, Chloe.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.149
Pretty soon, no one will have to.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.473
I don't even know
if you can hear me...

19:57.280 --> 20:01.831
...but I need you to know...

20:03.720 --> 20:07.315
...that from the first moment
that I saw you...

20:07.480 --> 20:12.634
...I knew that no one could
make me happier than you.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.353
But I also knew
that you'd never change.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.718
You'd... You'd always be running around,
trying to save the day.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.873
All those times I pulled away...

20:26.080 --> 20:29.516
<i>...it's</i> because I knew
this day would come.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.748
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- Please, you need to clear the room.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.070
Charging 200. Clear.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.432
Charging 300. Clear.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.549
Charging 300. Clear.

21:25.920 --> 21:29.515
Three-fifty. Clear.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.871
Okay, I'm calling it.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.469
Time of death, 7: 18 a.m.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.669
Oh, my God.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.395
Miss Lang. Miss Lang.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.792
Oh, no.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.111
Mr. And Mrs. Kent...

23:13.600 --> 23:15.830
...we did everything we could...
- No.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.638
...but we lost him.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.677
Doctor, we have a problem
with the Kent boy.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.520
<i>Two minutes to launch.</i>

24:01.440 --> 24:03.271
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

24:15.960 --> 24:17.951
<i>Seal outer doors.</i>

24:18.640 --> 24:20.756
<i>Security level four.</i>

24:21.000 --> 24:23.230
<i>Warning systems on.</i>

24:24.600 --> 24:26.909
<i>Access denied.</i>

24:29.000 --> 24:31.833
<i>Final launch sequence initiated.</i>

24:32.040 --> 24:33.359
<i>Access denied.</i>

24:33.520 --> 24:38.310
<i>Lockdown complete.</i>
<i>Sixty seconds to ignition.</i>

24:47.320 --> 24:49.390
Oh, God.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.196
Why couldn't you understand?
This is the only way!

25:07.160 --> 25:12.188
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

25:12.360 --> 25:18.276
<i>... five, four, three, two, ignition.</i>

25:50.360 --> 25:51.759
Hello, Kal-EI.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.079
How do you know to call me that?

25:55.240 --> 25:57.151
You're my son.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.152
Jor-EI?

26:04.920 --> 26:10.040
And I hope the time is coming when
you will call me father.

26:12.640 --> 26:13.959
I was...

26:14.120 --> 26:16.111
I was just at the hospital. How did...?

26:16.280 --> 26:17.713
How did you get me here?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.632
The portal in the cave.

26:22.800 --> 26:27.510
When this body was activated
by the crystal, it became a...

26:27.680 --> 26:29.716
An oracle of Kryptonian knowledge.

26:29.880 --> 26:34.635
A vessel for me to inhabit
if ever you should need me.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.199
That time was now.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.557
Am I dead?

26:42.160 --> 26:45.197
Your mortal journey is over, yes.

26:45.360 --> 26:49.035
But your imminent destiny
is too important to be sacrificed.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.997
You will return...

26:51.160 --> 26:53.913
...with all your natural gifts.

26:54.760 --> 27:00.995
Unfortunately, this rectification
does not come without a price.

27:05.480 --> 27:11.396
The life of someone close to you
will be exchanged for yours.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.519
No.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.636
No, I would never ask for that.

27:22.800 --> 27:27.510
You already did when you decided
to relinquish your powers and disobey me.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.193
It was your choice.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.836
Then just don't bring me back.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.317
It's too late.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.070
For everything in nature,
there is a balance.

27:46.880 --> 27:52.079
The life force that has been returned
to you will soon be taken from...

27:54.880 --> 27:56.359
From someone you love.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.508
You're about to face
your darkest hour, my son.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.834
But remember...

28:07.000 --> 28:09.719
...the lessons
that we learn from pain...

28:09.880 --> 28:12.713
...are the ones
that make us the strongest.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.477
Always know that I love you.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.469
Clark.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.919
The hospital lost our son.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.992
If I had any idea what happened...

29:58.160 --> 30:00.469
<i>...I</i> wouldn't have to call the police,
now would I?

30:00.640 --> 30:04.838
Listen, I want you to get ahold of
Sheriff Adams and send her over there.

30:08.760 --> 30:12.594
- I have to call you back.
- Clark.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.078
Oh, Clark. Clark.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.834
Son. They told us you were dead.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.509
Yeah...

30:35.200 --> 30:36.838
I was.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.829
- Jor-EI?
- Yeah.

30:41.880 --> 30:44.269
He returned your powers, didn't he?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.230
I'm not human anymore.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.315
It was the only way
I could come back.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.791
We heard about a missile malfunction.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.793
You stopped it, didn't you?

31:09.480 --> 31:12.074
It's not easy to sacrifice
the thing you want the most...

31:12.240 --> 31:13.992
...to save other people.

31:14.160 --> 31:16.720
We're so proud of you, clark.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.989
The real sacrifice would've been
not coming back at all.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.113
Son.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.074
After all those threats...

31:36.240 --> 31:39.710
...Jor-El just decided to offer
to give you your powers back?

31:41.360 --> 31:43.510
He didn't ask for anything in return?

31:47.160 --> 31:48.559
No.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.830
Mr. And Mrs. Kent?

32:24.720 --> 32:26.278
Clark.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.549
Lana.

33:17.400 --> 33:21.234
I heard about clark's resurrection.

33:22.200 --> 33:26.034
You know, I've... I've never
really believed in miracles...

33:26.200 --> 33:29.192
<i>...but</i> I've certainly done my share
of asking for them today.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.191
Me too.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.158
But I think that
we have different reasons.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.275
It's clark's medical file.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.317
That's confidential.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.994
I heard you asked for it at the hospital.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.557
All of his test results
came back normal.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.317
When are you gonna realize, Lex,
that he is just like the rest of us?

34:02.640 --> 34:04.278
Do you really believe that?

34:05.440 --> 34:08.955
Or is that what you have to tell yourself
to stay in a relationship with him?

34:09.120 --> 34:11.509
You've had doubts about him too.
You can't deny it.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.318
I was wrong.

34:13.719 --> 34:18.110
Believe me, there's nothing
unusual about Clark...

34:18.280 --> 34:21.875
...except his ability to see the good
in people who don't deserve it.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.753
I think you're
forgetting something, Lana.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.154
Whatever new lie he told you...

34:30.320 --> 34:32.914
...however he swept it under the rug...

34:33.400 --> 34:36.516
...a normal person
doesn't rise from the dead.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.672
Aren't you gonna
give your old dad a hug?

34:56.679 --> 34:59.399
I was told you were missing
from Belle Reve.

35:00.240 --> 35:03.516
Man, I don't understand.
You've been nearly catatonic for weeks.

35:04.160 --> 35:09.280
Didn't I just overhear you say
you'd been looking for miracles all day?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.751
Looks like I'm it.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.276
So maybe now
you can tell me why you've...

35:20.440 --> 35:22.032
You've been wandering <i>around...</i>

35:22.200 --> 35:25.158
...mumbling things like
"Krypton" and "Kal-EI."

35:25.320 --> 35:28.551
Krypton? Kal-EI? I <i>don't...</i>

35:28.720 --> 35:33.669
The last thing I remember
is standing here arguing with you.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.676
That was weeks ago.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.234
Okay.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.595
You don't recognize these?

35:45.360 --> 35:47.954
Looks like something from the cave.
What is it?

35:48.120 --> 35:51.351
I found you carving them
with a corkscrew.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.557
Oh, wasn't I creative.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.917
I wish that I could unlock
the labyrinth of my subconscious.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.150
I'm sorry to disappoint you, son.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.476
I have my father back.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.676
What's to disappoint?

36:12.240 --> 36:15.277
If anything, I'd say
this is cause for celebration.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.796
When Kansas didn't merge
with Oklahoma today...

36:30.960 --> 36:33.110
...I kind of guessed you were involved.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.951
Looks like you're okay.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.557
You don't look too bad yourself.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.438
For a dead guy.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.668
I heard what happened at the hospital.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.113
You went and got your powers back,
didn't you?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.915
I didn't have a choice.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.231
I know how much
you've dreamt of <i>having...</i>

37:04.400 --> 37:08.029
...a bland, mundane, generic life...

37:08.200 --> 37:10.873
...but being normal is highly overrated.

37:12.360 --> 37:16.069
And besides, it makes my whole
sidekick role a lot easier...

37:16.240 --> 37:18.674
...if you can bring super-duper
strength to the table.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.709
I mean, not that we didn't make
a great team out there today...

37:23.880 --> 37:27.350
...minus the whole part where
I was kidnapped and you were shot.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.239
So...

37:35.640 --> 37:39.394
...are you healing,
or how does that work exactly?

37:46.840 --> 37:49.035
Unscathed on the surface.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.397
But that's not what's going on
underneath, is it, Clark?

38:05.280 --> 38:08.556
I guess I'll never be able
to escape who I really am.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.836
Back to the lies...

38:13.880 --> 38:16.872
...and hoping no one
will ever ask to see the scar.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.996
Namely, Lana?

38:22.000 --> 38:26.198
- We've never talked about Lana...
- That's because we don't need to, clark.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.396
I'm a big girl now.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.788
I do have one confession.

38:35.160 --> 38:39.836
I really liked being
the only one who knew all about...

38:40.000 --> 38:42.878
...you know, you.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.752
For lack of a cheesier word,
it just made it...

38:47.560 --> 38:48.959
...special.

38:52.640 --> 38:58.909
But if you honestly believe that you can
stay with Lana and not tell her...

38:59.080 --> 39:01.150
<i>...I</i> think you're
seriously kidding yourself.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.996
I don't have a choice.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.074
I can't expect her to react like you did.

39:12.520 --> 39:15.318
But don't you think
you owe her the choice?

39:16.160 --> 39:18.276
I can't take that risk.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.394
I've risked too much already.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.632
And now someone else
is gonna have to pay for it.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.876
Clark, is everything okay?

39:38.040 --> 39:39.792
What's going on?

39:41.960 --> 39:44.599
I never should've given up my powers.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.638
Why didn't I listen to him?

39:54.840 --> 39:57.673
Chloe, I think
I've made a terrible mistake.
