00:57.308 --> 00:59.060
Directed by CHO Yong-Sun

01:10.029 --> 01:12.448
They're racing towards the finish!

01:13.407 --> 01:16.077
JEONG Woo-sang in Lane 4 is in the lead.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.287
- He is!
- He's fast.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.040
CHO Won-il in Lane 3 is coming up close!

01:21.040 --> 01:22.958
- Yes.
- They're rivals.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.629
The young swimmers are truly amazing!

01:26.712 --> 01:28.339
They're incredibly fast.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.091
Will JEONG win?

01:30.758 --> 01:31.967
Way to go, Won-il!

01:32.051 --> 01:33.469
CHO Won-il comes on strong!

01:33.719 --> 01:34.804
Really!

01:36.055 --> 01:37.264
Go Won-il!

01:37.348 --> 01:40.476
CHO has never lost
the 400 meter Freestyle yet!

01:40.601 --> 01:43.896
What a great, young swimmer!

01:43.979 --> 01:45.648
Amazing!

01:53.697 --> 02:01.914
NO BREATHING

02:08.211 --> 02:10.047
You dare glare at me?

02:17.555 --> 02:19.265
Think this is funny?

02:22.685 --> 02:26.689
Won-il, here's your reality...

02:28.274 --> 02:29.441
You're expelled.

02:29.817 --> 02:34.905
You can take night school
to get a high school diploma.

02:34.905 --> 02:39.118
But I didn't drink. I just kept watch.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.246
Look, Won-il!

02:44.081 --> 02:45.624
Welcome to the real world.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.835
The watch dog gets the blame.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.588
What about the other boys?

02:50.921 --> 02:55.968
You gotta have something to fall back on.

02:56.051 --> 02:59.597
Like being top students, or a mega rich family.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.183
So different from you, huh?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.465
Shake hands, fool.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.844
I won't hit you.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.305
That way you'll be dang sorry.

03:41.931 --> 03:42.765
For life.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.916
Shinsa Station, please.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.835
Huh? What?

04:13.879 --> 04:17.716
- Shinsa Station, please!
- Right. This is a taxi.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.635
Hold on.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.471
- Mister! I'm busy! - What, fool?

04:22.554 --> 04:23.931
How in the world!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.434
- What?
- You'd better get off.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.770
You're refusing a passenger?

04:29.853 --> 04:32.564
- I don't care!
- Something urgent came up.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.275
Let's go! I'm busy!

04:34.275 --> 04:35.609
Please understand?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.863
- I'm not getting off!
- Then, I'll get off.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.615
What? Mister!

04:42.449 --> 04:44.994
Stop! Come back!

04:45.369 --> 04:46.453
Peppers...

04:47.579 --> 04:48.747
garlic...

04:49.164 --> 04:52.084
and meat!

04:53.544 --> 04:54.628
Awesome!

04:56.297 --> 04:57.298
Some personality.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.425
How can you eat?

05:00.009 --> 05:02.052
I love meat! Have some, too.

05:02.177 --> 05:05.764
I'm so mad, I lost my appetite.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.309
- Go ahead. - Okay.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.487
- What will you do now?
- Come up with a business plan.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.281
Wanna get hit with a radish?

05:22.448 --> 05:25.743
- I love radish.
- I'll rub your face with garlic!

05:27.036 --> 05:28.329
Start swimming again.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.663
I'll get you into a high school for sports.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.791
Just go there and get a diploma.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.752
But I hate the water.

05:34.793 --> 05:35.961
I hate a high school dropout!

05:36.086 --> 05:38.964
- I don't even take baths.
- Think of your dad.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.842
- Don't talk about him.
- Then, think of your mom.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.510
You promised her!

05:44.178 --> 05:46.055
That you'll get a diploma.

06:08.077 --> 06:08.994
JEONG Woo-sang!

06:09.244 --> 06:11.747
What's your reason for assaulting Peterson?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.665
Is it due to your recent poor records?

06:13.749 --> 06:17.878
What disciplinary action
from FINA do you expect?

06:18.087 --> 06:21.590
After winning last year's
world championships...

06:21.715 --> 06:26.553
JEONG Woo-sang fell in a slump
and assaulted a rival swimmer.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.728
The media is all over it.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.022
There's nothing we could do.

06:37.272 --> 06:41.110
If it happened here, we could've kept it quiet.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.738
But he hit an Australian rep.

06:49.660 --> 06:53.122
Please understand our position.

06:53.122 --> 06:53.997
Mr. Chairman.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.667
I'm disappointed.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.503
How can you do this to me?

07:01.171 --> 07:04.299
That's not what I meant.

07:05.676 --> 07:10.681
How about a fresh, new start?

07:10.848 --> 07:11.849
It'll work out.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.978
But we should win back public sentiment.

07:18.564 --> 07:19.690
No way.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.484
You have no choice.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.528
How can you do this?

07:25.237 --> 07:28.657
With just a year to the Olympics,
how can I go back to school?

07:28.991 --> 07:30.909
So why cause trouble!

07:34.955 --> 07:37.541
Don't whine like a baby and go.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.182
What brings you here?

07:54.641 --> 07:57.728
Chang-sik! Looking good!

07:58.061 --> 08:00.647
I've always looked good.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.691
Why'd you come?

08:03.901 --> 08:06.487
Take a kid in your swim team?

08:07.613 --> 08:09.823
This isn't a community pool.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.243
I'm not taking a kid in the middle of the year.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.539
I heard about the additional recruitment.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.501
That's a show.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.961
The Association wants me to take
in JEONG Woo-sang.

08:23.337 --> 08:27.090
We put the notice out, so it won't look bad.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.885
So, take one more kid along with him.

08:29.968 --> 08:33.054
He's really good. Use to be JEONG's rival!

08:33.347 --> 08:35.557
I'm doing you a favor, pal.

08:37.934 --> 08:38.936
What sports high school is he from?

08:39.977 --> 08:42.606
- Just regular school... - Why you!

08:42.898 --> 08:44.316
Buy me drinks some time!

08:44.525 --> 08:47.486
That's how you wanna play? I can play, too!

08:48.070 --> 08:50.989
Soon-young is desperately
looking for someone!

08:51.114 --> 08:53.534
Says she'll gouge his eyes out
when she finds him!

08:53.784 --> 08:55.160
Damn it!

08:56.245 --> 08:58.830
Soon-young? Who's that?

08:58.956 --> 09:01.375
Like you don't know.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.982
Hey! Long time no see!

09:34.700 --> 09:36.201
The hell?

09:36.994 --> 09:39.162
I love eating like this.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.583
Eat up. You'll need it to start training.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.293
Training?

09:44.835 --> 09:47.504
He's making a comeback as a Water-boy.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.256
But keep your promise.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.426
Free rent and big allowances!

09:52.551 --> 09:54.845
And all-I-can-eat-meat once a week!

09:54.845 --> 09:59.016
I keep my promises, kid. Think I'd lie to you?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.648
Ow, my stomach. I gotta go.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.405
Daddy!

10:13.530 --> 10:16.074
Loud ones don't stink.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.370
He pooped his pants. Go check.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.958
Anyway, it's nice.
Lonely lives living together.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.302
You play music?

10:36.511 --> 10:38.347
Unbelievable.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.682
Are you stupid?

10:40.849 --> 10:42.934
It's cool how you stuck to one thing.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.064
You should, too. Stop wandering off.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.275
You looked the best when you swam.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.968
No need to pay me. Just get off!

11:17.552 --> 11:19.971
Report me! You're getting off here!

11:20.263 --> 11:22.808
Do I have to hit the passenger?

11:23.100 --> 11:26.019
Get off! Get off!

11:26.353 --> 11:27.813
Get off!

11:27.813 --> 11:29.481
- I'm not going to school! - Go!

11:30.732 --> 11:31.983
I won't go!

11:32.109 --> 11:35.404
Go! Go to school!

11:35.404 --> 11:36.363
That hurts!

11:37.280 --> 11:39.491
- I won't go! - You said you'll go!

11:39.616 --> 11:41.076
- I won't go!
- Why won't you!

11:41.201 --> 11:42.285
Go!

11:42.369 --> 11:43.912
You're here! Go!

11:43.995 --> 11:46.289
- I won't!
- Go!

11:46.373 --> 11:49.042
- Won't go!
- Go! This is your school!

11:49.126 --> 11:50.919
- I won't!
- Go!

11:51.002 --> 11:51.920
I'll go!

11:52.295 --> 11:54.840
- No! I won't go!
- What? Then, go!

11:58.135 --> 11:59.094
Hey!

12:00.095 --> 12:02.764
Yes, sir! Go to school!

12:08.478 --> 12:10.605
Go to school!

12:15.068 --> 12:16.570
KOREAN HIGH SCHOOL OF SPORTS

12:20.282 --> 12:21.575
Damn.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.422
What a way to meet.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.632
Nice!

12:40.510 --> 12:42.971
There's no other room.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.932
I never shared a room before.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.560
Good! Then, try it.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.729
Coach! I'm JEONG Woo-sang!

12:50.854 --> 12:52.272
I know.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.526
- I know.
- But I'm JEONG Woo-sang!

12:56.610 --> 12:57.778
How can you do this to me?

13:00.739 --> 13:06.328
They suddenly took in two new recruits?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.420
Attention!

13:17.130 --> 13:18.298
We got some new faces.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.927
- You all know JEONG Woo-sang? - Yes.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.304
Greet them.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.227
That's it?

13:30.644 --> 13:31.520
Yes.

13:32.813 --> 13:33.939
Man...

13:34.689 --> 13:37.317
Fine! Start practicing!

13:37.776 --> 13:39.945
Coach? What about me?

13:41.446 --> 13:43.698
Oh! This is...

13:44.491 --> 13:46.201
His name is...

13:46.535 --> 13:48.537
Wan-il? That's it!

13:48.578 --> 13:50.121
JEONG Wan-il? JANG Wan-il?

13:50.372 --> 13:54.125
- CHO...
- CHO Wan-il! Let's go!

13:54.334 --> 13:56.628
Let's start practice! Go!

14:06.972 --> 14:08.723
Go! You can do it!

14:09.140 --> 14:11.726
Just a bit more! He's good.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.478
- Fool!
- Go! Go!

14:14.062 --> 14:15.647
Why aren't you going in?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.108
I didn't bring my swimsuit.

14:18.733 --> 14:22.362
Wan-il forgot his dear swimsuit?

14:22.696 --> 14:23.488
Yes.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.448
How do I kill you, fool!

14:25.824 --> 14:28.326
Why you little!

14:28.535 --> 14:29.703
Come here!

14:29.703 --> 14:31.413
WASTE FOOD,
NO MEDAL FINISH ALL, GOLD MEDAL

14:41.715 --> 14:42.924
Hey, New Face.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.134
Huh?

14:44.467 --> 14:47.053
See you in our room later.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.138
Why?

14:48.430 --> 14:51.433
Just come if we tell ya.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.484
Came here for an easy way into college?

15:01.776 --> 15:03.278
This place is tough.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.071
Remember that.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.364
Right.

15:06.489 --> 15:10.452
Saw many boys puke blood trying
to catch up to us.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.830
Can I go sleep now?

15:27.385 --> 15:31.473
We're picky on who we take in.
But we like you.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.099
We allow you to come in under us.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.768
I'm not into groups.

15:35.518 --> 15:39.439
Even if you can eat like this every day?

15:43.985 --> 15:46.571
I'll join! This is totally my style!

15:46.988 --> 15:49.491
How about a drink to welcome Won-il?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.618
That's really expensive!

15:52.535 --> 15:53.370
You know, huh?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.246
Here, have a drink.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.501
I have a bad experience with liquor...

15:59.668 --> 16:02.462
Then, let's change that to a good one!

16:02.545 --> 16:04.297
If we get caught, we'll be expelled.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.676
So, we'll drink in secret!

16:07.884 --> 16:10.512
Still, I can't. I'm not drinking.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.639
Fine, then! Don't!

16:16.142 --> 16:17.227
You're ticked off?

16:17.477 --> 16:23.191
CHO Min-Guk uses his specialty!
No Breathing!

16:23.274 --> 16:25.318
He is doing No Breathing!

16:25.485 --> 16:27.988
He is so far ahead of the others!

17:57.952 --> 18:00.371
I only had chicken...

18:04.876 --> 18:07.837
Water, please...I'm thirsty.

18:10.965 --> 18:15.970
I received a tip about an incident last night.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.848
Those who drank inside the residence...

18:20.308 --> 18:22.936
I'll give you a chance to step forward.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.564
One.

18:30.068 --> 18:30.944
Two!

18:39.452 --> 18:40.453
It was you?

18:41.663 --> 18:42.288
Yes, sir.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.041
Let's hear your reason.

18:48.128 --> 18:52.090
I was stressed over how to like the water...

18:52.215 --> 18:53.842
Why you little.

18:54.717 --> 18:59.722
You come into the swim team
and get drunk over...

18:59.931 --> 19:02.767
not liking the water?

19:09.607 --> 19:11.734
I think the whole team needs more discipline.

19:12.026 --> 19:15.697
Everyone swim 50 laps roundtrip!

19:16.197 --> 19:17.824
And no weekend outings!

19:19.200 --> 19:20.034
Get moving!

19:21.327 --> 19:23.830
Coach? This is not right, sir.

19:23.872 --> 19:24.914
What?

19:25.707 --> 19:29.794
It's unfair for everyone to be punished
because of me.

19:29.961 --> 19:30.920
Why you...

19:32.380 --> 19:33.298
CHO Won-il.

19:34.716 --> 19:38.344
So, you'll take responsibility?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.765
- Of course, sir. - Fine.

19:44.142 --> 19:49.022
CHO Won-il will swim
500 laps roundtrip alone!

19:50.190 --> 19:53.318
If he succeeds, you'll get your outings.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.449
Get going, fool!

20:12.170 --> 20:14.005
Guys! It's okay.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.443
Dismissed!

20:37.403 --> 20:39.072
What a retard.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.615
Crazy fool.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.898
Should we call an ambulance?

21:14.691 --> 21:15.900
How can you say that?

21:19.195 --> 21:21.572
Just beg for forgiveness!

21:22.198 --> 21:23.491
Your heart will burst, man!

21:24.200 --> 21:27.036
Yeah, let's go beg!

21:28.955 --> 21:31.582
- What?
- It's all your fault.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.085
- Drinking was your idea! - It was your idea!

21:34.168 --> 21:35.336
Drinking was your idea!

22:03.197 --> 22:04.949
What's he saying?

22:12.290 --> 22:14.584
He asks if the cafeteria is closed.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.505
"Really?"

22:20.089 --> 22:22.717
Take the fool and feed him! Hurry!

22:27.805 --> 22:28.931
Pork chops...

22:29.223 --> 22:30.266
Hamburgers...

22:30.641 --> 22:32.810
Steak...please...

22:32.852 --> 22:34.645
That weird fool!

22:37.648 --> 22:40.234
- Won-il! You're the man!
- I'm dying...

22:40.318 --> 22:42.570
- What do you want? - Steak...

22:42.779 --> 22:44.155
Eat everything!

23:08.137 --> 23:09.180
Dang.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.893
I want water...

23:16.562 --> 23:17.563
Water.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.482
What?

23:20.858 --> 23:21.943
Look.

23:22.568 --> 23:25.279
I can't grab anything with my hands trembling.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.281
Water.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.450
Crazy fool.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.077
Water.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.302
Feed me.

23:50.221 --> 23:54.475
- Want me to call your minions?
- No, you feed me.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.061
Why should I?

23:57.687 --> 24:01.065
I ended up like this cuz you squealed.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.444
Who says I squealed?

24:04.527 --> 24:06.154
If not, forget it.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.531
Water.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.417
Get the angle right.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.751
I'll pour it on you!

24:21.127 --> 24:22.420
Okay, man.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.723
- Wanna die!
- Come on, we're friends.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.725
Who says I'm your friend?

24:35.808 --> 24:39.395
Don't remember? I found your medal for you.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.369
Hey! This is yours!

24:56.162 --> 24:59.123
This is your medal!

25:00.082 --> 25:01.167
Hey!

25:02.835 --> 25:04.378
Your medal!

25:05.254 --> 25:07.256
Yes! Loser!

25:10.301 --> 25:12.929
Dad! Drive! Hurry!

25:13.387 --> 25:14.347
I ain't your daddy...

25:20.311 --> 25:21.270
It's yours.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.897
You dropped it.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.024
I didn't drop it. I threw it out!

25:25.650 --> 25:27.777
Why throw out a hard-earned medal?

25:27.944 --> 25:29.570
Cuz I hate silver medals!

25:29.987 --> 25:30.988
Then...

25:33.533 --> 25:35.243
You can have this gold medal.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.911
What are you doing?

25:37.036 --> 25:40.790
We have lots of gold medals at our house.
You can have it.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.384
Enjoying school life?

25:51.717 --> 25:54.011
Brings back old memories?

26:01.269 --> 26:04.313
Guess so. I forgot for a while.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.191
But the past is just the past.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.986
I don't care about that stuff.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.531
Cool comment. I like it.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.659
Any hardships at school?

26:18.494 --> 26:19.787
I hate everything.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.998
The slacking and drooling...

26:22.498 --> 26:24.750
Slacking? Drooling?

26:25.126 --> 26:26.002
Is it good?

26:26.377 --> 26:27.920
- Have some meat. - It's delicious!

26:29.839 --> 26:31.591
Bone! Bone!

26:47.273 --> 26:49.275
Off to shoot a commercial again?

26:50.526 --> 26:52.069
Not greeting your seniors?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.447
What you looking at?

26:55.406 --> 26:56.407
Woo-sang.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.660
The pool water really sucks these days.

27:01.245 --> 27:04.498
So change it for us?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.210
Then, you should just give up swimming.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.962
How do you expect to compete?

27:10.630 --> 27:11.672
Say that again?

27:16.177 --> 27:16.927
You moved?

27:17.178 --> 27:18.888
Nope. Looks like you missed.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.556
Don't you dare!

27:20.681 --> 27:21.724
Hi, Coach!

27:24.894 --> 27:26.604
Consider yourself lucky.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.234
Did you eat, sir?

27:32.360 --> 27:36.030
Of course I ate. Can't go around hungry.

27:36.238 --> 27:37.823
I heard it'll rain tomorrow.

27:38.032 --> 27:41.202
Guess rain doesn't matter being at the pool.

27:41.452 --> 27:42.578
All day long!

27:42.870 --> 27:44.163
Cut it out, stupid.

27:49.168 --> 27:53.756
That ungrateful fool! I just saved your life!

27:55.049 --> 27:59.804
Wake up! Rooftop! Wake up!

28:00.262 --> 28:03.599
Hey! CHO Won-il!

28:04.016 --> 28:07.478
- Why so early... -Come down right now!

28:07.812 --> 28:11.440
Come down! I'll give you meat!

28:12.024 --> 28:13.067
CHO Won-il!

28:15.069 --> 28:17.738
It's Sunday morning!

28:31.210 --> 28:31.961
What's wrong?

28:33.254 --> 28:34.088
What?

28:41.679 --> 28:42.972
I'm beat.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.559
Tired?

28:46.934 --> 28:47.727
Yes.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.732
Where is this place?

28:54.483 --> 28:57.862
Unbelievable. You really are dumb.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.284
Daddy!

29:04.493 --> 29:05.828
Daddy!

29:06.370 --> 29:08.706
Stop swimming and play with me!

29:09.790 --> 29:12.042
You said we'll go watch baseball!

29:16.464 --> 29:17.298
Hey!

29:30.686 --> 29:31.562
CLOSED DOWN

29:31.562 --> 29:32.980
Must be sad.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.527
You first learned to swim here.

29:39.779 --> 29:40.863
No way.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.116
I don't remember this place at all.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.914
Let's just set up before the sun sets.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.473
How's school? Make any friends?

30:09.975 --> 30:13.729
Two really good guys and an uptight fool.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.272
An uptight fool?

30:30.454 --> 30:31.789
Why always me!

30:32.456 --> 30:33.374
Damn it!

30:46.554 --> 30:50.140
Whoa! Woo-sang! You got so big!

30:52.226 --> 30:53.394
Nice!

30:55.771 --> 30:58.357
Yours is a bit lacking.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.444
See ya.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.991
It's cuz it's cold!

31:09.285 --> 31:12.496
We just came from cold water, right?

31:13.289 --> 31:14.290
You're cold?

31:15.499 --> 31:16.667
Good!

31:23.382 --> 31:26.677
Those idiots!

31:26.886 --> 31:28.679
How do I kill them!

31:39.189 --> 31:40.024
Come here!

31:43.819 --> 31:46.113
- Pardon?
- Dance again, Dae-chan.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.574
I said, dance.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.881
Pretty good!

32:05.883 --> 32:08.677
Good! You're a natural!

32:09.511 --> 32:11.138
Cut it out!

32:11.597 --> 32:12.681
Why you!

32:12.932 --> 32:13.849
Get down now!

32:14.808 --> 32:16.268
You fool.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.484
Won-il...Won-il...

32:24.193 --> 32:26.904
What's with your record?

32:27.947 --> 32:29.740
I'm trying hard, sir.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.867
Don't try hard.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.369
Do your best, fool!

32:34.036 --> 32:37.081
Come here to swim, not goof off!

32:37.456 --> 32:39.792
But I feel a little down today...

32:40.376 --> 32:41.794
Down?

32:42.336 --> 32:43.295
I'll beat you down!

32:43.587 --> 32:45.965
Give me something! Anything!

32:46.048 --> 32:47.174
Why you!

32:48.968 --> 32:50.636
Damn...

32:51.178 --> 32:51.929
Next! LEE Jung-dong!

32:56.016 --> 32:58.477
You fools wanna live like this?

32:59.853 --> 33:03.232
Don't you feel motivated watching Woo-sang?

33:03.315 --> 33:06.068
Don't you want to try and beat him?

33:06.485 --> 33:07.486
No.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.196
No?

33:09.571 --> 33:10.656
Why you little!

33:11.365 --> 33:12.366
Ouch!

33:16.537 --> 33:17.705
I'm just kidding!

33:18.414 --> 33:20.124
Get up! Hurry!

33:20.332 --> 33:22.126
I was just joking.

33:22.209 --> 33:25.754
Be a man! I was just kidding!

33:26.797 --> 33:28.340
Smile. Smile, fools.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.592
This is nothing.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.554
Kids these days are so weak!

33:33.554 --> 33:35.681
It's all for their good.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.599
Laugh, fools.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.158
My specialty! Soju and beer mix!

33:55.034 --> 33:55.993
Thanks.

34:00.789 --> 34:04.668
You lied about Won-il, didn't you?

34:04.835 --> 34:08.672
We're pros. Can't you tell by looking at him?

34:09.089 --> 34:10.674
Tell what?

34:11.632 --> 34:16.889
He gets drunk and swims as a hobby!

34:17.056 --> 34:19.600
That's what I can tell!

34:20.184 --> 34:23.562
Who cares if he was hot when he was young?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.981
He's lousy now.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.484
It's cuz he still has regular school in him.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.945
I'll make sure he gets on track.

34:34.447 --> 34:38.202
Jae-seok, the Mr. Angel.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.621
2 more dishes of beef ribs, please!

34:42.498 --> 34:44.792
But their specialty is pork ribs...

34:44.958 --> 34:47.002
I only eat expensive beef.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.797
Damn pig.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.216
What?

34:52.216 --> 34:54.967
Ah, they use healthy pigs.

35:03.477 --> 35:04.478
Sir?

35:05.813 --> 35:06.730
Won-il.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.192
Why'd you come here so late?

35:16.949 --> 35:18.784
It's chicken, your favorite.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.287
Eat it with your friends.

35:24.331 --> 35:25.332
Thank you.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.084
No need.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.261
I'll be going.

35:47.312 --> 35:47.980
Won-il.

35:49.940 --> 35:50.816
Yes?

35:53.402 --> 35:54.862
I believe in you.

36:00.534 --> 36:01.535
Go on in.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.637
Have some more.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.851
I booked your training abroad.

36:26.643 --> 36:29.354
I got Lucas BALL to coach you.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.568
Are you listening?

36:37.946 --> 36:38.906
Yes.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.535
Stay focused.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.831
You can fall behind any minute.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.634
Aren't you having more?

36:59.009 --> 36:59.968
I had a lot.

37:05.599 --> 37:08.060
Looks like a fake illness.

37:08.227 --> 37:11.188
Just checking. My record is bad these days.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.941
Uncle is still at it?

37:14.733 --> 37:16.944
I think the problem is him.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.987
He's too hard on you!

37:19.321 --> 37:20.697
I'll tell Dad.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.032
You, little!

37:22.616 --> 37:25.494
- Okay! Stop!
- Don't you dare!

37:27.704 --> 37:28.497
Woo-sang.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.792
Swimming is important, but take it easy.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.420
Do things you like and relax.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.465
I don't have time for that.

37:45.222 --> 37:54.064
The wind whispers my name

37:54.773 --> 37:58.860
My heart calls out to...

38:05.701 --> 38:08.245
- Thank you for everything. - My pleasure.

38:09.663 --> 38:10.831
Come on, Woo-sang.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.708
We'll miss the plane.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.710
I'm coming.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.340
Take care!

38:23.427 --> 38:26.596
I heard you're moving to Australia. Take care.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.586
Why're you here?

38:57.961 --> 38:59.254
Dang!

39:05.719 --> 39:10.223
You all eat so well. Guess 25lbs wasn't enough.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.310
- Thank you, sir! - Sure. Eat up.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.068
Eat all you want.

39:22.069 --> 39:22.986
Nice.

39:23.904 --> 39:25.280
What a coincidence.

39:25.781 --> 39:26.990
You're his roommate?

39:27.282 --> 39:27.824
How've you been?

39:28.742 --> 39:29.659
Not bad.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.328
- No.
- Did you tell him?

39:31.745 --> 39:33.288
Won-il, did you?

39:33.288 --> 39:35.540
The important thing is he came.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.503
Why bring me flowers?
Should've brought food.

39:40.212 --> 39:40.796
Eat up.

39:41.963 --> 39:42.714
You eat.

39:43.298 --> 39:44.966
Then, I'll eat it!

39:46.051 --> 39:49.012
Dear, wait till it's cooked before you eat.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.348
Uncooked pork could kill you.

39:52.057 --> 39:52.974
She's cool.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.101
Here!

39:57.187 --> 39:58.522
That's a good boy!

40:03.402 --> 40:04.653
I don't eat pork.

40:05.070 --> 40:05.904
Really?

40:06.238 --> 40:06.988
Hanna!

40:10.158 --> 40:11.785
Unbelievable.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.621
I'm a big fan of yours.

40:14.913 --> 40:18.583
I saw the article...You were amazing.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.295
How you punched out those foreign swimmers.

40:22.462 --> 40:23.463
Well...

40:25.340 --> 40:26.716
How about a drink?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.510
I don't drink soda.

40:29.302 --> 40:30.762
So picky.

40:31.138 --> 40:35.517
Anyway, it's great to see Won-il
made so many friends.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.979
Come over and hang out here anytime!

40:38.979 --> 40:40.063
Yes, sir!

40:40.230 --> 40:41.857
Not too often for you.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.485
How'd you know about my welcoming party?

40:46.236 --> 40:48.780
Didn't think you'd come. You don't like me.

40:51.032 --> 40:51.908
I like you...

40:54.119 --> 40:55.120
Jung-eun.

41:09.676 --> 41:10.927
What's your motive?

41:11.428 --> 41:14.347
- Motive? - You even know celebrity ladies!

41:15.265 --> 41:16.433
Ladies?

41:20.228 --> 41:21.229
Goddamn!

41:22.689 --> 41:26.693
Why make a scandal with a poor, normal girl?

41:27.903 --> 41:31.781
Eating different side dishes is fun.
Why not with girls?

41:32.073 --> 41:33.200
It's fun.

41:36.286 --> 41:38.747
You bastard! I'm warning you!

41:38.747 --> 41:41.917
If you hurt her, I'll kill you!

41:42.209 --> 41:43.460
Got that?

41:45.045 --> 41:46.296
Do you like Jung-eun?

41:46.421 --> 41:47.839
We're not like that.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.467
Then, butt out. I'm serious.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.220
I really like Jung-eun.

42:01.561 --> 42:02.896
You liar!

42:02.979 --> 42:05.732
Said you hit on different girls!

42:05.732 --> 42:07.651
I don't believe you!

42:08.443 --> 42:10.070
It's not me! Coach OH!

42:11.238 --> 42:13.448
Coach OH!

42:15.617 --> 42:17.035
Hi, Coach.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.496
Hi, Won-il...

42:21.164 --> 42:24.876
That fool! At an important moment!

42:25.001 --> 42:26.753
How do I kill him?

42:28.672 --> 42:31.216
Way to go, Sun-woo!

42:31.967 --> 42:33.510
That was good!

42:33.593 --> 42:36.763
Let's see your hands. That tickles!

42:37.847 --> 42:39.516
I'll get you!

42:54.489 --> 42:56.032
Did you lose your phone?

42:56.116 --> 42:57.826
Why don't you take my calls?

42:58.118 --> 42:59.953
Well, I was busy...

43:00.996 --> 43:02.581
How'd you know I was here?

43:03.248 --> 43:04.541
I told you I like you.

43:05.375 --> 43:06.835
Of course I know.

43:07.294 --> 43:10.005
Whatever! Are you delirious?

43:14.551 --> 43:15.343
What?

43:16.303 --> 43:17.762
Such a good girl.

43:20.807 --> 43:23.685
Let's finish up and eat. I'm starving.

43:32.819 --> 43:33.737
Yeah!

43:43.580 --> 43:44.956
Why do you eat this?

43:45.040 --> 43:49.210
There's lots of other...good food.

43:49.336 --> 43:51.421
Chicken feet are really good!

43:53.465 --> 43:54.883
Come on. Try one.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.803
No way! You eat it.

44:03.266 --> 44:05.602
Wanna get gizzard instead?

44:07.145 --> 44:09.689
Gizzard?

44:10.482 --> 44:12.317
That rotten bastard!

44:12.651 --> 44:14.653
I'll make sure you rot in hell!

44:15.236 --> 44:15.987
For sure!

44:22.535 --> 44:23.870
Hey!

44:24.287 --> 44:26.498
It's your dad's passing anniversary soon.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.044
Is it?

44:31.544 --> 44:33.004
But how...

44:33.088 --> 44:36.049
How can you forget your dad's passing?

44:36.800 --> 44:38.218
What's the plan then?

44:38.718 --> 44:40.428
I leave for special training tomorrow.

44:40.553 --> 44:41.721
What about your dad?

44:41.888 --> 44:43.223
I usually don't do anything.

44:43.390 --> 44:44.557
But you're his son...

44:44.557 --> 44:46.476
Why should I remember such a selfish man?

44:56.486 --> 44:59.656
He has a way of wanting me feel like Soju.

45:00.615 --> 45:02.701
Jae-seok, get a bottle of Soju.

45:03.493 --> 45:04.619
Yes, sir.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.508
I'm so full.

45:18.925 --> 45:21.845
How can a guy not eat chicken feet?

45:22.178 --> 45:24.389
How can a girl eat stuff like that?

45:24.639 --> 45:29.185
A man should at least be able
to chew on chicken feet.

45:46.453 --> 45:48.413
WELCOME DAEHAN SWIM TEAM

45:52.208 --> 45:53.126
Hi, good afternoon.

45:53.168 --> 45:54.836
Welcome to MARCO POLO,
Davao, Philippines.

45:55.128 --> 45:56.296
Good Philippines, Davao.

45:56.671 --> 45:57.839
Go team!

46:00.884 --> 46:03.595
Let's be friends for life.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.263
You bet.

46:10.351 --> 46:11.311
Look!

46:12.771 --> 46:13.980
Girls!

46:37.003 --> 46:37.879
I love you.

46:38.129 --> 46:38.922
Wake up, fools!

46:39.255 --> 46:40.173
Huh?

46:41.341 --> 46:42.801
Stop crawling like babies!

46:43.301 --> 46:44.219
Run fast, fools!

46:49.516 --> 46:50.433
The hell?

46:50.809 --> 46:52.977
Those fools again!

46:53.478 --> 46:55.939
How do I kill them!

46:56.189 --> 46:57.774
It's a race!

46:58.983 --> 47:00.610
Last one in will die!

47:01.569 --> 47:02.403
Run!

47:09.244 --> 47:12.455
So refreshing. That feels good.

47:14.374 --> 47:16.709
Where'd Woo-sang go?

47:17.335 --> 47:19.963
Don't know? He's getting trained privately.

47:32.559 --> 47:35.812
Looking good. Half time, 30 seconds.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.648
- It's hilarious!
- Really?

48:20.648 --> 48:23.568
- He's totally burned.
- I should've been there!

48:23.651 --> 48:25.361
I knew I smell kimchi in here.

48:26.738 --> 48:28.114
Oi! Korean!

48:28.573 --> 48:29.949
What do you think you're doing here?

48:30.283 --> 48:32.243
You think you're going to the olympics?

48:32.952 --> 48:34.787
Want me to kick your ass again?

48:36.331 --> 48:39.000
Go ahead. If you got the balls...

48:39.208 --> 48:40.251
Korean!

48:41.169 --> 48:42.670
Olympics? Yeah I know...

48:42.754 --> 48:44.631
I'll make sure you never swim again!

48:44.797 --> 48:47.300
Come on! Right here...Let's go.

48:47.508 --> 48:48.676
Right here...Right here...

48:48.676 --> 48:49.552
Back off.

48:49.552 --> 48:50.470
What?

48:50.595 --> 48:51.763
- Huh?
- White fools.

48:51.846 --> 48:52.847
You! White chocolate!

48:52.889 --> 48:54.557
White chocolate? What's that even mean?

48:54.599 --> 48:55.308
White chocolate?

48:55.516 --> 48:56.476
You head crazy?

48:56.517 --> 48:57.477
You wanna have a go? I wa...!

48:58.937 --> 49:00.021
- What?
- Look.

49:00.229 --> 49:01.481
Don't mess with my friend.

49:01.564 --> 49:02.899
- You die!
- Huh?

49:02.941 --> 49:05.318
Who are you? Who are you, little monkey boy?

49:05.318 --> 49:05.818
Me?

49:07.111 --> 49:08.947
JEONG Woo-sang's friend. Okay?

49:13.576 --> 49:16.162
Aussie Aussie Aussie! Oi oi oi!

49:29.926 --> 49:30.760
Ready!

49:32.720 --> 49:33.429
Go!

49:40.561 --> 49:41.854
Yeah, right!

49:42.230 --> 49:42.981
Let's go!

49:45.817 --> 49:47.360
Go! You can do it!

49:47.485 --> 49:49.153
Go!

49:50.113 --> 49:50.822
Right! Right!

49:50.989 --> 49:52.740
That's all he got. No problem.
Bring it in, bring it in.

49:53.408 --> 49:55.785
You got it come on! Let's go, Alex!

49:57.453 --> 49:59.163
Nice...Keep going, come on!

49:59.664 --> 50:00.748
Let's go, Alex!

50:04.627 --> 50:05.586
Move!

50:07.213 --> 50:08.214
That hurt.

50:11.050 --> 50:12.343
There, we go!

50:19.350 --> 50:23.604
Go JEONG Woo-sang! Go!

50:23.688 --> 50:26.024
Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi! Yeah!

50:26.065 --> 50:28.234
Yeah, You can do it! You can do it!

50:29.819 --> 50:32.071
He's got nothin'! Yeah! He's got nothin'!

50:32.280 --> 50:35.366
What is that? What is that, black magic?

50:50.882 --> 50:53.092
The hell are they up to now!

51:30.963 --> 51:32.340
We won!

51:35.635 --> 51:36.928
What is that?

51:49.732 --> 51:52.652
CHO Min-guk uses his specialty!
No Breathing!

51:52.819 --> 51:54.570
No Breathing?

51:54.570 --> 51:57.740
A special technique of swimming
without breathing!

52:44.162 --> 52:46.873
You really are uptight.

52:46.914 --> 52:50.084
Really wanna swim till our last day here?

52:50.710 --> 52:52.086
Enjoy life a little.

52:53.129 --> 52:54.046
Enjoy it?

52:55.756 --> 52:58.467
Even those who place
last competes to be first.

52:59.135 --> 53:03.222
An athlete who wants to enjoy it,
is dang embarrassing.

53:04.432 --> 53:06.058
You enjoy life all you want.

53:21.407 --> 53:22.408
Min-guk.

53:27.121 --> 53:28.539
How've you been?

53:29.832 --> 53:31.918
Won-il went to special training.

53:32.418 --> 53:33.920
He's brighter now.

53:36.464 --> 53:38.549
But he's still mad at you.

54:05.701 --> 54:07.536
Coach JANG!

54:08.246 --> 54:10.122
Welcome, sir!

54:10.206 --> 54:12.917
- Forget it.
- Beef again, right?

54:13.376 --> 54:16.879
Look. What's with Won-il?

54:17.546 --> 54:18.798
Screwed up again?

54:19.590 --> 54:22.218
By chance, is he Min-guk's son?

54:23.010 --> 54:25.263
Who says?

54:25.388 --> 54:27.556
It's so obvious!

54:28.140 --> 54:32.144
He did No Breathing, just like Min-guk!

54:48.369 --> 54:51.580
The power of love is amazing

54:52.290 --> 54:55.543
Through tiring days, it makes me smile

54:57.336 --> 55:01.215
Like the rainbow after the rain

55:01.799 --> 55:04.260
Seeing you gives me strength

55:06.262 --> 55:09.515
What are you thinking?

55:10.099 --> 55:13.602
Thinking of you makes me smile

55:15.021 --> 55:19.066
Even through my busy days

55:19.483 --> 55:23.029
I'm happy because of you

55:37.543 --> 55:38.753
Hello?

55:41.213 --> 55:43.591
What's it to you where I am?

55:45.843 --> 55:47.636
Your phone manner sucks.

55:50.639 --> 55:52.308
How'd you know about here?

55:53.184 --> 55:54.560
I have a good source.

55:55.770 --> 55:56.729
Take it.

55:57.313 --> 55:58.773
I got it at the duty free.

55:59.815 --> 56:01.275
Take it!

56:02.109 --> 56:03.319
So lucky...

56:04.195 --> 56:06.530
I picked it out and brought it here myself.

56:08.324 --> 56:09.784
Do you really like me?

56:11.827 --> 56:13.412
I got cut from the national team.

56:13.996 --> 56:16.665
I gotta focus and train hard to get back in.

56:16.957 --> 56:19.668
If I came here at an important time like this...

56:22.088 --> 56:23.381
it means I like you.

56:25.383 --> 56:26.884
But I don't like you.

56:27.093 --> 56:28.094
Crazy!

56:28.177 --> 56:29.303
Right...

56:30.054 --> 56:30.763
But you will.

56:32.223 --> 56:34.266
Don't leave me hanging and take it.

56:34.266 --> 56:38.521
Take it! Take it!

56:40.147 --> 56:41.399
Can I give it away?

56:42.608 --> 56:43.901
It's up to you.

56:52.993 --> 56:54.328
Changed shampoos?

56:54.912 --> 56:56.122
Smells great.

56:59.708 --> 57:00.376
I'll go.

57:04.422 --> 57:05.131
What is it!

57:05.631 --> 57:06.424
Whoa!

57:06.924 --> 57:08.884
- It's Burberry!
- It's not a fake, is it?

57:08.968 --> 57:10.428
JEONG Woo-sang's loaded!

57:10.719 --> 57:13.931
I'm so jealous. Can I have it?

57:35.244 --> 57:36.328
Hey.

57:36.829 --> 57:38.873
Know the girl who lives below?

57:40.749 --> 57:45.546
What about JEONG Woo-sang,
the national star?

57:48.340 --> 57:49.425
You know?

57:52.303 --> 57:55.890
Think Woo-sang and Jung-eun
suit each other?

57:59.768 --> 58:00.686
No, right?

58:01.896 --> 58:02.813
What about me?

58:07.109 --> 58:09.653
Hey! I'm talking to you!

58:09.987 --> 58:11.322
Come here, you!

58:12.781 --> 58:13.741
Hey!

58:15.034 --> 58:17.161
Now, you're yelling at cats?

58:19.747 --> 58:21.123
What did you hear?

58:22.583 --> 58:24.168
Hear what?

58:24.335 --> 58:26.128
Did you bad mouth me to the cat?

58:26.795 --> 58:28.088
Of course not.

58:32.259 --> 58:33.093
What?

58:33.552 --> 58:34.261
My gift.

58:34.929 --> 58:37.097
- Unbelievable!
- For what?

58:37.181 --> 58:38.390
You cheapskate!

58:38.474 --> 58:40.726
That's why you don't have a girlfriend!

58:40.893 --> 58:42.520
Who'd like you?

59:04.375 --> 59:06.293
Kick! Higher!

59:06.961 --> 59:07.545
Breathe less!

59:11.006 --> 59:13.008
Kick harder, fool!

59:14.176 --> 59:14.760
Harder!

59:21.350 --> 59:25.229
The Nationals are coming up.
When will you snap to it?

59:25.980 --> 59:26.897
Seniors!

59:27.523 --> 59:29.149
Don't want to go to college?

59:29.692 --> 59:33.737
Entry to the Nationals will be by record.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.573
Not by grade!

59:36.115 --> 59:37.491
Dismissed!

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.811
DO IT TO, GET GOLD NOT DO IT,
NO MEDAL

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:09.857
Woo-sang?

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:14.695
Mind if we work out together?

01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:21.452
Sorry. Guess I'll be in your way.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.040
I didn't say you couldn't.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:27.666
You're free to work out.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:35.799
One, two, three.

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:37.134
Chest up!

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:38.385
Four.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.511
Five.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:41.930
Six.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.066
What are you doing?

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:56.779
So I can brag you're my friend,
when you win the gold.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.116
Aren't you practicing?

01:01:29.812 --> 01:01:30.854
How long's it been?

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.481
A while.

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:36.944
Am I finished?

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:38.487
Don't go overboard.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:41.240
Every swimmer has minor injuries like that.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:54.920
Mom?

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:56.922
It's me.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:01:59.425
Yeah, I ate.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:01.760
See the doc?

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:08.016
Take your medication. It's not much.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:11.562
Don't worry about me.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:13.689
By the way...

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:16.942
I can't come home on your birthday.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.112
It's not that.

01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:23.657
I may go to the Nationals.

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:29.079
You're happy?

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:30.789
Okay.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:34.042
I'll call again, soon. Bye.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.010
SURVIVAL AUDITION 'HI STAR'

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:58.275
You're a miracle to me. Like the warm sun

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:02.988
A dazzling jewel to me

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:10.537
You fill my heart like sweet cream

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:14.875
You're a miracle to me

01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:19.880
When I am down

01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:22.966
When I am lonely

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.346
You always stand by me

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:35.145
Through the darkness, you shine for me

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:38.690
You're my bling star

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.279
I'm following my dreams

01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:47.449
I'm going my way

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:52.746
I'll shine like the stars above

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:56.500
You're my bling star

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:59.711
I'm your bling star

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:05.467
All for our dreams

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.495
You're my bling star

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.582
I'm your bling star

01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:40.878
All for our dreams

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:45.841
You're my bling star

01:04:45.966 --> 01:04:49.052
I'm your bling star

01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:54.725
All for our dreams

01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.479
Unbelievable!

01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:07.571
Attention!

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:09.656
Greetings!

01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:11.241
Hello, sir!

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:15.203
The entry list for the Nationals
has been decided.

01:05:16.288 --> 01:05:17.247
YOON Kyun-sang.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:18.373
Yes.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.626
- LEE Il-min.
- Yes.

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:23.337
- Yes.
- SOHN Seung-woo.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:24.671
JEONG Woo-sang.

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:25.964
Yes.

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:28.800
LEE Jung-dong.

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:31.094
Yes!

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.391
You're that happy?

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:40.062
NA Dae-chan! Shouldn't you be disappointed?

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.898
Jung-dong practiced so hard!

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:44.274
Right, Won-il?

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.401
Right.

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.779
Hopeless fool.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.240
Dismissed!

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.535
After all the beef I fed you!
You leave him out?

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.371
You saw him do No Breathing!

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.915
Why didn't you train him hard to make it?

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:03.543
I did what I could with Won-il.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.837
But he's got no will!

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:09.883
If I drag him and throw him in,
think he'll change?

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:11.718
You really think that?

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:20.352
This beef is to die for.

01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:22.020
Eat pork, fool!

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.981
That's their specialty here!

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.277
Hello.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:38.662
Who reeks of medicine?

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:46.128
Pick it up.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.464
Pick it up, fool!

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:03.145
A cripple like you going to the Nationals?

01:07:03.145 --> 01:07:05.272
Just take pills and rest at home.

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.942
Please! Let me off this once?

01:07:08.984 --> 01:07:09.735
What the hell...

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.283
You fool!

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.579
If you hide an injury,
you gotta fork up the scholarship.

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:21.788
I'll give you one day.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:23.707
Get lost quietly.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:32.424
Please! No! Please!

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.343
Bastard! Get lost!

01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:41.058
Disappear will ya!

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.440
You can't quit like this.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:50.567
I was going to quit anyway.

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:55.280
I can't afford it, and Mom's sick.

01:07:56.156 --> 01:07:59.785
I thought I'd get better by trying hard.

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:02.746
But it's no use.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:10.754
What about me? I can't swim as well as you!

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.089
Not you, too.

01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:15.258
You'll regret this. You traitor!

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.015
Maybe I will.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.935
That's why I really wanted to win a medal.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.191
I'm sorry, Jung-dong.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.236
For not knowing and asking to goof off.

01:08:51.837 --> 01:08:56.633
LEE JUNG-DONG LEFT SCHOOL
ON FAMILY REASONS

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:01.470
BUS TERMINAL

01:09:02.848 --> 01:09:03.974
Sorry! Excuse me!

01:09:20.282 --> 01:09:21.575
LEE Jung-dong!

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.368
Fool...

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:30.709
Start up again.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:33.712
Get your back treated and swim again.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.589
You can't give up like this.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.591
You tried so hard, man!

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.386
Won-il.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.639
You know there's no hope
for me in swimming.

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:49.519
But stop wandering and try your best, pal.

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:51.979
Don't talk about me!

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:53.939
Time to go.

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:40.695
Jung-dong said to give you this.

01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:43.281
WITH MY AMAZING FRIEND, WOO-SANG

01:11:12.269 --> 01:11:13.228
Losers.

01:11:13.353 --> 01:11:16.273
Their pal got kicked out, but they can eat?

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:24.114
Coach JANG is a good man.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:28.368
I squealed, but he made it
so that LEE won't have to pay up.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:29.411
What's this a charity for bums?

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.424
This is why I hated it!

01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:44.050
This is why I hated swimming!

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.886
Why'd you do that to Jung-dong!

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.935
Why not me!

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.186
You bastard!

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.158
No!

01:12:08.283 --> 01:12:09.242
Let go.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.785
Let go!

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:13.288
Fool!

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:18.084
Stop it!

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:37.228
DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:32.784
Great!

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:35.495
You're ahead of the record!
Just a bit more, Min-guk!

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:40.583
OLYMPIC TRIALS IN SWIMMING

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:27.547
Min-guk!

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:28.923
Min-guk!

01:14:29.174 --> 01:14:30.884
Let go, you fools!

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:58.161
Min-guk!

01:14:58.495 --> 01:15:00.288
Honey! No!

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:03.917
He's my dad! Let go!

01:15:04.042 --> 01:15:05.877
He's my dad!

01:15:06.044 --> 01:15:09.255
Daddy! Daddy!

01:15:36.783 --> 01:15:40.119
It's me. I have a favor to ask.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:44.249
I'll meet you at our school's gym.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.584
Thanks. Bye.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:57.804
JEONG Woo-sang.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:15:59.556
Thank you.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.266
You like CHO Min-guk that much?

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:05.478
Pretty unique.

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:08.940
A top-class swimmer's role model
is a second-class...

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:12.068
Anyway, you owe me an exclusive. Okay?

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:13.611
Yes.

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.083
CHO Won-il!

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:29.794
You didn't eat?

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:34.507
This won't change anything!

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:38.011
You should at least eat.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:39.971
Won-il!

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:42.890
Hey! CHO Won-il!

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:54.152
Who are you?

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:56.988
Why you little! I could punch you!

01:16:57.822 --> 01:17:01.409
The door hit my head!
My eyes almost popped!

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.121
My head.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.457
Thank you.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:14.088
I might have the change...

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:17.550
Keep it to get that treated. It's swollen.

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:22.722
I'm so dizzy. Ow, my head!

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.766
I'll be going then!

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:31.773
This is called breaking and entering.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.817
I thought you took pills, drowning in misery.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:36.819
You saw I'm alive and well.

01:17:37.195 --> 01:17:38.363
Now, go.

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:32.125
You're way past retirement.
Why do you keep competing?

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.043
It's because of my family.

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:36.754
I always placed second or third.

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:42.468
I feel sorry to my supportive wife and son
who is also a swimmer.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:44.762
Your son swims, too?

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.849
Does he always place second or third, too?

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:50.935
Won-il is different from me.

01:18:51.936 --> 01:18:53.062
He always places first.

01:18:53.688 --> 01:19:01.654
But he says I'm the swimmer
he respects the most.

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.908
So, I want to set a record today.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:08.035
For my son, Won-il.

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:12.081
I can't retire without a good record.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:16.544
Any last comments for your family?

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:18.713
Dear...

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:23.009
Thank you for your support.

01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.344
This is my last race.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.723
I'll make it up to you from now on.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.808
And my son, Won-il...

01:19:31.309 --> 01:19:34.729
I'm sorry I couldn't play with you much.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.858
After this race, let's go on trips,

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.736
and to baseball games.

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:43.905
Promise.

01:19:46.574 --> 01:19:48.075
I love you so much.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.245
My son, Won-il...

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.180
Don't put this beside Mom!

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:13.017
How could you? Wanna swim in your grave!

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:28.282
STOP BREATHING AND SWIM HARD!
FOR MY LOVING WIFE AND SON!

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:34.789
Who asked you to set a record?

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.214
I never asked you to win a gold medal.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:47.677
I just asked...

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:51.764
to watch baseball together...

01:20:56.435 --> 01:21:00.231
Just go and cheer. That's all I asked.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:08.281
Why?

01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:12.660
Why'd you do it?

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:17.999
Why'd you die! Why!

01:21:29.886 --> 01:21:32.346
I was so scared.

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:36.392
Dad...

01:21:38.853 --> 01:21:43.900
Dad! Dad!

01:21:44.859 --> 01:21:46.235
I miss you.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:57.830
Dad!

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:30.488
What now? Why do you keep coming?

01:22:38.913 --> 01:22:41.082
ENTRY APPLICATION

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:47.880
What is this?

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.009
Take me on!

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.270
You'll get a hole in your stomach.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:04.939
Always drinking and not eating.

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:07.608
I watch the side dishes I drink with...

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.569
Get up.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:12.446
Go away.

01:23:13.406 --> 01:23:14.907
- Please?
- Stop it.

01:23:15.116 --> 01:23:16.701
Then, I'll eat it all!

01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:18.744
Sure. Go ahead.

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:26.961
The food here is the best.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:32.133
But where's the meat?

01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:35.136
An athlete can't eat like this.

01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:37.847
I can't make the Nationals just on greens!

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:40.266
The Nationals?

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:42.059
I just came back from applying.

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:43.394
Really?

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:47.773
Since I got cut from school, coach me.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.068
You forced me to start swimming again.

01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:53.237
Who says you can eat!

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.281
There's no meat! Don't eat!

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:59.035
Your face is half its size. Let's go eat beef!

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:00.494
Steak for me!

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.705
Fine! Whatever you want.

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:04.081
- Tenderloin!
- Ribs!

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:05.541
Skirtmeat.

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:07.877
That's pork.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.675
You were pretty great.

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:18.888
See? Told you, you'd fall for me.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:20.973
Don't start up again.

01:24:21.057 --> 01:24:23.350
Don't let it get to your head.

01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:28.022
Just admit it. I'm a great guy.

01:24:28.773 --> 01:24:31.734
Why of course you are.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:38.657
Stupid!

01:24:43.954 --> 01:24:45.372
Stop it!

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:16.445
Nice!

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.249
You poor thing.

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.543
What the?

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.046
Oh yeah!

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:39.426
Run one more time?

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:41.595
Nope. Many times.

01:25:58.112 --> 01:26:00.739
Good! Keep it up!

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:10.833
Skipping practice?

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:15.171
You have to stay in camp?

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.506
It's cuz I made it to the Top 10.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.134
I can't go to the competitions.

01:26:20.551 --> 01:26:22.970
Wait! I can have this, right?

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.267
Where'd you get that?

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:29.727
Found it in your room.

01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:35.024
- Then...
- Yup, I saw the letter.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.797
Dear Jung-eun...

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:03.344
To Jung-eun...

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.013
Jung-eun. It's me, Won-il.

01:27:06.597 --> 01:27:10.601
We've known each other long,
but it's my first letter to you.

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:14.813
We had a lot of fun, you and I.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:17.399
- Many memories together. - Gotcha!

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:22.071
We laughed. We cried.

01:27:22.363 --> 01:27:23.906
We sometimes fought.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:26.700
We were close like brothers and sisters, right?

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:33.749
But I suddenly wondered...

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:37.586
if we had things we couldn't tell each other.

01:27:39.546 --> 01:27:41.048
I think I do.

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:47.680
Jung-eun...I think I like you.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.563
What the...

01:27:57.022 --> 01:28:00.442
How cheesy...CHO Won-il! Crazy fool!

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.284
How embarrassing!

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:10.828
Why read it!

01:28:10.995 --> 01:28:12.663
So embarrassing!

01:28:19.962 --> 01:28:21.547
Congratulations
on becoming the Chairman.

01:28:21.714 --> 01:28:24.133
It's all thanks to you.

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:29.555
- No need.
- Thank you for everything.

01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:30.973
- Here.
- Sure.

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:38.856
- Yes?
- About the Nationals...

01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:45.154
Does Woo-sang really need to go through it?

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:50.951
We have him in mind.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:57.875
We're thinking of cancelling all events
that Woo-sang is in.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:00.711
Is that so?

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:02.671
- Let's toast.
- Sure.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.506
Why should I!

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.217
Why go to the Olympics in such a lousy way?

01:29:07.468 --> 01:29:10.012
- No! I won't do it!
- Stay out of this.

01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:13.015
Let me qualify fair and square.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:21.065
- I apologize. - It's okay.

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:27.071
How dare you!

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:28.739
How could you?

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:31.033
Just quit swimming, then!

01:29:31.909 --> 01:29:33.243
Fine. I will.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:35.579
What did you say!

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:38.874
Dear! Please! Stop!

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:42.378
Woo-sang! Tell him you're sorry!

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:44.922
Don't you know it's for your own good?

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:47.925
I don't need it.

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:50.010
I'd rather quit...

01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:53.889
than go like a coward to the Olympics.

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.557
How dare you!

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:59.061
Get out of my sight, now!

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:02.064
- Sorry, Mom.
- Woo-sang...

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.298
Sleeping?

01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:12.384
No.

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:22.436
If the competitions get cancelled,
let's just say I lost.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.233
What do you mean?

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:43.999
Sleeping?

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:48.545
Yeah.

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:10.984
A spinal disc is touching the nerves.

01:32:12.236 --> 01:32:18.200
The operation is simple,
but rehabilitation will take time.

01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:21.203
Does Woo-sang know?

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:23.205
Yes.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:29.294
Then, why didn't you tell me?

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.548
He asked me not to tell you.

01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:36.635
He said if you knew, you'd be sadder than him.

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:40.097
I'm sorry, Uncle.

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:52.985
Hello, Dad.

01:32:57.698 --> 01:33:01.660
You got your wish. Happy?

01:33:03.704 --> 01:33:04.997
I'm sorry.

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:06.999
No need for that.

01:33:10.294 --> 01:33:11.545
Since you're competing...

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:16.883
show them what you got.

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:52.336
495...

01:33:52.419 --> 01:33:54.338
I can't do any more!

01:33:55.339 --> 01:33:56.715
Won-il?

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:19.029
How many did I do?

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:35.128
Take less breaths! Keep it under 7!

01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:38.256
I heard Woo-sang does it in 6.

01:34:38.382 --> 01:34:39.424
What?

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:41.093
Chang-sik, that fool!

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:43.261
Then, we'll do it in 5! No, in 3!

01:34:43.303 --> 01:34:45.222
Don't breathe at all!

01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:52.771
PREMINLARY STANDINGS

01:34:52.771 --> 01:34:56.024
1st JEONG WOO-SANG 2nd LEE JAE-KYU
3rd CHO WON-IL

01:35:02.072 --> 01:35:03.240
Won-il?

01:35:05.283 --> 01:35:06.410
Sir?

01:35:09.413 --> 01:35:11.748
Have a drink.

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:13.667
I don't drink.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.502
It's on behalf of your dad.

01:35:16.086 --> 01:35:16.837
Take it.

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:22.509
Here.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.264
No Breathing is tough, huh?

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.099
Did you see?

01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:31.143
Then, forget it.

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:33.311
What?

01:35:33.687 --> 01:35:36.273
It's nothing special.

01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:40.277
Just a matter of who can hold
their breath longer.

01:35:41.236 --> 01:35:45.699
Breathing is instinctive.
It's hard trying not to.

01:35:46.783 --> 01:35:49.578
So, forget No Breathing.

01:35:58.462 --> 01:36:00.046
Good job in the preliminary.

01:36:01.006 --> 01:36:02.340
Not as good as you.

01:36:03.425 --> 01:36:05.135
Now, it's the finals.

01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:07.053
Good luck.

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:11.308
We can't just end it like this.

01:36:15.187 --> 01:36:16.438
How about a bet?

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:18.440
A bet?

01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:21.610
A bet over Jung-eun.

01:36:23.236 --> 01:36:27.282
The loser walks away from her.

01:36:27.407 --> 01:36:28.950
What do you mean?

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:31.536
I didn't realize...

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:33.789
But I like Jung-eun, too.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.876
What do you say?

01:36:39.503 --> 01:36:41.046
I'm answering you.

01:36:45.634 --> 01:36:47.177
I'm going to get ready.

01:37:10.033 --> 01:37:12.994
The power of love is amazing

01:37:14.079 --> 01:37:17.165
Through tiring days, it makes me smile

01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:23.129
Like the rainbow after the rain

01:37:23.797 --> 01:37:26.466
Seeing you gives me strength

01:37:28.426 --> 01:37:32.055
What are you thinking?

01:37:32.389 --> 01:37:35.517
Thinking of you makes me smile

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:41.565
Even through my busy days

01:37:42.023 --> 01:37:44.526
I'm happy because of you

01:37:46.653 --> 01:37:50.824
I've never felt this way before

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:54.578
I'm curious of your everything

01:37:55.245 --> 01:38:00.166
The world calls my name

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:04.004
My dreams will come true

01:38:04.963 --> 01:38:07.382
I will shine dazzling bright

01:38:08.842 --> 01:38:12.721
Everything seems so beautiful

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:18.268
Till the sea runs dry

01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:21.938
I will sing my song

01:38:23.815 --> 01:38:27.277
STOP BREATHING AND SWIM HARD!
FOR MY LOVING WIFE AND SON!

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:39.956
This is the National
Swimming Championships.

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:44.544
Now, the Men's 400 meter
Freestyle competition.

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.339
The intensity is hot!

01:38:47.464 --> 01:38:48.590
It's scorching.

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:52.677
- JEONG Woo-sang has a big part in it. - Yes.

01:38:52.802 --> 01:38:56.640
He was recently taken off the national team.

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:58.600
It must've been hard for him.

01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:01.061
Let's hope he makes a strong comeback.

01:39:01.061 --> 01:39:05.398
CHO Won-il in the next lane. Is he new?

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:09.152
It looks like he's not completely new.

01:39:09.152 --> 01:39:12.238
Once a top juvenile swimmer,
he's back after 7 years.

01:39:12.322 --> 01:39:14.407
He placed 3rd in the preliminaries.

01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:16.326
It's amazing after 7 years away.

01:39:16.368 --> 01:39:19.621
Let's look forward to JEONG's
successful comeback.

01:39:19.663 --> 01:39:22.707
And CHO Won-il as well.

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:25.210
CHO Won-il! Go!

01:39:26.503 --> 01:39:29.089
JEONG Woo-sang! Go!

01:39:29.965 --> 01:39:31.049
CHO Won-il!

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:32.550
JEONG Woo-sang!

01:39:32.634 --> 01:39:36.054
Won-il! Woo-sang!

01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:38.598
Lane 3, CHO Won-il.

01:39:44.437 --> 01:39:46.982
Lane 4, JEONG Woo-sang.

01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:34.237
They're off!

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:37.699
JEONG Woo-sang and CHO Won-il!

01:40:37.824 --> 01:40:40.160
They're going strong from the start!

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:43.371
They're both swimming way too fast.

01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:45.373
Is it CHO's strategy?

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:46.583
They're incredibly fast.

01:40:50.795 --> 01:40:54.132
They make their first turn at 50 meters.

01:40:54.132 --> 01:40:57.594
They're swimming at a world record pace!

01:40:59.721 --> 01:41:00.430
STANDINGS AT 50 METERS

01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:01.556
1st CHO WON-IL 2nd JEONG WOO-SANG

01:41:02.182 --> 01:41:03.683
Can you believe that?

01:41:03.767 --> 01:41:05.852
World record paces at the Nationals?

01:41:05.894 --> 01:41:08.146
I can't. This must be a dream!

01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:09.189
Right?

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:11.149
- It's not a dream!
- Hey!

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:20.825
JEONG is expected, but what about CHO?

01:41:21.076 --> 01:41:25.080
What did he do during his 7 years away?

01:41:25.163 --> 01:41:26.289
Must've done something.

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:31.878
JUNG and CHO make their turn at 100 meters.

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:34.255
They have a big lead.

01:41:34.464 --> 01:41:37.926
How can they be so far ahead of the others?

01:41:38.176 --> 01:41:39.761
Do they have motors on their suits?

01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:41.930
I doubt it.

01:41:51.231 --> 01:41:52.232
"GO! WOO-SANG, OUR HOPE!"

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.443
JEONG Woo-sang takes the lead!

01:41:55.735 --> 01:41:59.864
JEONG puts an end to the tight race!

01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:03.409
- CHO has been outclassed.
- That's right.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:05.370
JEONG is a world-class swimmer!

01:42:05.453 --> 01:42:09.499
I hope he keeps going strong
to win gold at the Olympics.

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:23.513
Good. You did your best.

01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:26.599
Of course! That was good.

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:52.333
What's happening?

01:43:03.178 --> 01:43:06.222
Unbelievable! That's really Won-il, right?

01:43:19.819 --> 01:43:23.948
Passion over fear.
Appreciation over passion.

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:26.242
Enjoying over appreciation.

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:33.541
When you enjoy it,
you'll perfect No Breathing.

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:38.129
Your dad had no fear in doing No Breathing.

01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:40.298
He always enjoyed it.

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:47.096
Because you were always there watching.

01:43:51.893 --> 01:43:53.853
Min-guk, are you watching?

01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:56.105
Your son's No Breathing...

01:43:58.107 --> 01:43:59.359
Are you watching, pal?

01:44:08.576 --> 01:44:13.790
CHO has already surpassed
JEONG's top Korean record.

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:16.584
Is this the birth of a new star?

01:44:16.751 --> 01:44:22.048
A shining star! CHO Won-il!

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:31.808
Looks like he is set to win!

01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:35.645
Amazing! Incredible!
CHO Won-il's No Breathing!

01:44:37.188 --> 01:44:40.066
What's with JEONG?

01:44:51.828 --> 01:44:54.330
Go Woo-sang!

01:45:15.226 --> 01:45:17.478
I have no intent on losing to you again.

01:45:18.021 --> 01:45:20.565
I worked harder than anyone to get here.

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:23.359
You're not the only one
who can do No Breathing.

01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:26.738
Woo-sang, it's not over yet.

01:45:26.821 --> 01:45:28.364
It's not over.

01:46:06.736 --> 01:46:08.863
They're absolutely crazy!

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:10.365
Really...

01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:53.491
FINAL STANDINGS

01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:56.536
1st CHO WON-IL 2nd JEONG WOO-SANG

01:46:57.453 --> 01:47:00.540
Winning by 0.01 seconds
and setting a new world record...

01:47:00.665 --> 01:47:03.000
CHO Won-il!

01:47:03.626 --> 01:47:05.086
- Unbelievable!
- Amazing!

01:47:05.086 --> 01:47:09.090
They're both amazing!

01:47:09.424 --> 01:47:12.635
Beautiful! Incredible!

01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:16.264
The future looks bright!

01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:33.239
Hey!

01:47:40.288 --> 01:47:41.706
Way to go!

01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:45.793
Good work!

01:47:47.295 --> 01:47:49.589
CHO Won-il! JEONG Woo-sang!

01:47:52.008 --> 01:47:53.468
Way to go!

01:48:15.364 --> 01:48:16.407
Dad...

01:48:19.118 --> 01:48:23.372
You never smiled even when you won first.

01:48:27.543 --> 01:48:29.921
Since you came in second...

01:48:33.299 --> 01:48:35.092
How about a family dinner out?

01:48:53.444 --> 01:48:55.446
Thank you, Dad.

01:48:56.239 --> 01:48:57.240
Sure.

01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:00.743
Good work, son.

01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:23.683
You're watching me swim, right?

01:49:24.475 --> 01:49:26.978
So, don't fight and be good.

01:49:28.479 --> 01:49:31.399
Here's another fan of yours, Dad.

01:49:35.319 --> 01:49:37.989
Hello, sir. I'm Won-il's friend,
JEONG Woo-sang.

01:49:38.906 --> 01:49:40.741
The national star.

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:43.828
Must be happy to have a fan like him.

01:49:48.291 --> 01:49:49.667
When are you flying off?

01:49:50.126 --> 01:49:52.169
- Don't give up.
- In two days.

01:49:53.004 --> 01:49:54.171
Hey, I'm JEONG Woo-sang.

01:49:55.339 --> 01:49:56.549
Keep your promise.

01:49:57.508 --> 01:49:58.509
Oh, right!

01:49:59.385 --> 01:50:00.303
The promise!

01:50:02.346 --> 01:50:05.850
Didn't we agree the loser
would give up on Jung-eun?

01:50:08.644 --> 01:50:11.314
We made a promise like that?

01:50:11.564 --> 01:50:12.523
Hey!

01:50:15.026 --> 01:50:16.527
You two are hilarious.

01:50:17.361 --> 01:50:19.864
Who says I like you guys!

01:50:19.989 --> 01:50:21.991
I decide who I like!

01:50:22.450 --> 01:50:23.784
Not you guys.

01:50:33.044 --> 01:50:34.253
You sillies!

01:50:35.963 --> 01:50:37.506
Why hit just me?

01:50:38.424 --> 01:50:40.259
You get hit, too.

01:50:40.426 --> 01:50:41.802
Hey!

01:50:49.894 --> 01:50:52.605
Brian, here we are at
the London 2012 Olympics.

01:50:52.688 --> 01:50:54.523
Men's 400 meter free-style's coming up

01:50:54.523 --> 01:50:56.651
and I must say the competition is fierce.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.695
Yes it is, Don. And we have a great line-up.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.323
But a I heard that the world record holders

01:51:02.782 --> 01:51:05.576
Cho Won-il and JEONG Woo-sang
are clear favors to win a gold.

01:51:05.785 --> 01:51:07.078
Won-il! Woo-sang!

01:51:07.078 --> 01:51:09.705
You know they absolutely are.
But we cannot discount

01:51:09.705 --> 01:51:11.957
the American, Australian or Chinese teams.

01:51:11.999 --> 01:51:13.459
They've really been giving it all this year.

01:51:13.626 --> 01:51:15.336
Uh...there could be blood in the water.

01:51:22.093 --> 01:51:24.178
Be cool. It's embarrassing.

01:51:24.553 --> 01:51:25.513
What?

01:51:26.764 --> 01:51:27.640
Wait!

01:51:28.557 --> 01:51:31.644
Why do you keep sending Jung-eun flowers?

01:51:31.644 --> 01:51:32.978
That's cheating!

01:51:33.896 --> 01:51:38.859
A fan can send flowers to his favorite singer.

01:51:39.235 --> 01:51:40.486
Ugly fool.

01:51:42.905 --> 01:51:46.909
Who's he calling ugly? I'm totally hot!

01:51:50.162 --> 01:51:51.956
What's with the shades?

01:51:53.332 --> 01:51:57.420
A celebrity is not at liberty
to expose her face.

01:51:57.461 --> 01:52:00.631
No one knows who you are!

01:52:01.257 --> 01:52:04.051
You can go on subways without any problems.

01:52:05.803 --> 01:52:08.055
Wait till my second album comes out.

01:52:08.055 --> 01:52:09.557
Try 7 or 8 albums, they won't know.

01:52:10.099 --> 01:52:11.142
Are you really my dad?

01:52:11.225 --> 01:52:12.226
Well, I'm not your mom.

01:52:12.601 --> 01:52:13.728
Why you!

01:52:14.437 --> 01:52:16.397
Stop hitting me! It's embarrassing!

01:52:16.522 --> 01:52:17.982
My daughter!

01:52:17.982 --> 01:52:21.777
America's Ryan PHILLIPS is in Lane 1.
Lane 2 is Hui DONG from China.

01:52:21.777 --> 01:52:23.529
Lane 3 is Schurrle from Germany.

01:52:23.529 --> 01:52:27.616
Our proud JEONG Woo-sang and
CHO Won-il are in Lanes 4 and 5.

01:52:27.616 --> 01:52:33.038
They placed first and second
in the preliminaries. Amazing!

01:52:33.038 --> 01:52:36.041
They are truly unbelievable!

01:52:36.125 --> 01:52:38.377
I still can't believe my eyes!

01:52:49.096 --> 01:52:50.389
Won't let ya win this time.

01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.433
Like you did before.

01:52:58.481 --> 01:52:59.482
Let's go!

01:54:04.547 --> 01:54:05.464
Hey!

01:54:06.257 --> 01:54:08.467
Is there a national male
synchronized swim team?

01:54:10.094 --> 01:54:12.429
Probably not.

01:54:16.767 --> 01:54:18.686
Then, we can be Nationals.

01:54:20.062 --> 01:54:20.604
Right on!
