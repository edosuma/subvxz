WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.428
The Master is Prime Minister
of Great Britain.

00:03.545 --> 00:05.639
And these are my friends.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.009
- They're called the Toclafane.
- What?

00:08.090 --> 00:10.185
- Are you going to tell us who he is?
- He's a Time Lord.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.184
He's cannibalised the Tardis.
It's a paradox machine.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.015
We meet at last, Doctor.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.101
Stop this! Stop it now!

00:18.727 --> 00:20.445
We can't stop him.

00:20.604 --> 00:25.235
Down you go, kids.
Remove one tenth of the population.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.569
I'm coming back.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.367
And the Earth was no more.

01:09.069 --> 01:13.119
Spacelane traffic is advised
to stay away from SOL 3,

01:13.198 --> 01:14.916
also known as Earth.

01:14.992 --> 01:19.338
Pilots are warned SOL 3
is now entering terminal extinction.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.506
Planet Earth is closed.

01:21.748 --> 01:26.424
Planet Earth is closed.
Planet Earth is closed.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.297
- What's your name, then?
- Tom Milligan.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.922
No need to ask who you are,
the famous Martha Jones.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.753
How long since you were last in Britain?

02:07.836 --> 02:11.591
365 days. It's been a long year.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.387
So what's the plan?

02:13.467 --> 02:16.892
This Professor Docherty,
I need to see her. Can you get me there?

02:16.970 --> 02:20.065
She works in a repair shed, Nuclear
Plant Seven. I can get you inside.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.393
What's this all for?
What's so important about her?

02:22.476 --> 02:25.650
Sorry. The more you know,
the more you're at risk.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.573
There's a lot of people depending
on you. You're a bit of a legend.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.401
And what does the legend say?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.987
That you sailed the Atlantic,
walked across America,

02:33.070 --> 02:35.994
that you were the only person
to get out of Japan alive.

02:36.073 --> 02:39.498
Martha Jones, they say,
she's gonna save the world.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.044
A bit late for that.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.668
How come you can drive?
Don't you get stopped?

02:43.747 --> 02:47.627
Medical staff. Used to be
in paediatrics back in the old days.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.929
But that gives me a license to travel
so I can help out at the labour camps.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.598
Great. I'm travelling with a doctor.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.098
Story goes that you're the only person
on Earth who can kill him.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.027
That you and you alone
can kill the Master stone dead.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.196
Let's just drive.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.493
Citizen; rejoice!

03:17.572 --> 03:20.576
Your Lord and Master stands on high!

03:20.659 --> 03:22.878
Playing track three.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.062
It's ready to rise, Doctor.

04:22.554 --> 04:26.900
The new Time Lord Empire.
It's good, isn't it? Isn't it, good?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.443
Anything?

04:29.519 --> 04:31.146
No? Anything?

04:34.524 --> 04:39.121
Oh, but they broke your heart,
didn't they, those Toclafane?

04:39.196 --> 04:41.949
Ever since you worked out
what they really are.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.411
They say Martha Jones

04:46.411 --> 04:48.209
has come back home.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.879
Now why would she do that?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.209
Leave her alone.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.177
But you said something to her,
didn't you?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.131
On the day! took control.

04:59.549 --> 05:03.304
- What did you tell her?
- I have one thing to say to you.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.311
- You know what it is.
- Oh, no you don't!

05:08.099 --> 05:10.727
Valiant now entering Zone One airspace.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.441
- Citizens, rejoice!
- Come on, people! What are we doing?

05:15.065 --> 05:17.944
Launch day in 24 hours!

05:36.419 --> 05:37.966
Morning, Tish!

05:38.922 --> 05:41.266
Ah! Smell that sea air!

05:42.008 --> 05:44.761
Makes me long
for good old British fish and chips.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.016
And what do I get? Cold mashed swede.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.527
Some hotel.
Last time I book over the internet.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.864
All over the Earth,
those things.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.492
He's even carved himself
into Mount Rushmore.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.410
Best to keep down.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.455
Here we go.

06:09.411 --> 06:13.757
The entire South Coast of England
converted into shipyards.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.130
They bring in slave labour
every morning,

06:16.251 --> 06:19.221
break up cars, houses, anything,
just for the metal,

06:19.296 --> 06:21.719
building the fleet out of scrap.

06:21.798 --> 06:25.268
You should see Russia.
That's Shipyard Number One.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.391
All the way from the Black Sea
to the Bering Strait,

06:27.470 --> 06:30.144
there's 100,000 rockets
getting ready for war.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.147
- War? With who?
- The rest of the universe.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.901
I've been out there, Tom, in space,
before all this happened,

06:37.022 --> 06:39.992
and there's 1,000 different
civilisations all around us

06:40.066 --> 06:41.909
with no idea of what's happening here.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.425
The Master can build weapons
big enough to devastate them all.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.364
- You've been in space?
- Problem with that?

06:46.489 --> 06:49.618
No! No, just... Wow.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.918
- Anything else I should know?
- I've met Shakespeare.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.631
- Identify, little man.
- I've got a license!

07:02.714 --> 07:06.639
Thomas Milligan, Peripatetic Medical
Squad. I'm allowed to travel.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.598
- I was just checking for...
- Soon the rockets will f! y!

07:10.680 --> 07:14.685
And everyone will need
medicine! You 'l! be so busy!

07:23.193 --> 07:26.788
But... they didn't see you.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.707
How do you think I travelled the world?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.249
The Master set up Archangel,
that mobile phone network,

07:33.328 --> 07:35.126
15 satellites around the planet.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.378
But really it's transmitting
this low-level psychic field.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.051
That's how everyone got hypnotised
into thinking he was Harold Saxon.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.045
Saxon! Feels like years ago.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.514
But the key's tuned in
to the same frequency.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.681
Makes me sort of, not invisible,
just unnoticeable.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.689
- Well, I can see you.
- That's 'cause you wanted to.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.067
Yeah, I suppose I did.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.565
- Is there a Mrs Milligan?
- No.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.489
- No. What about you?
- There used to be someone.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.034
Long time ago.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.796
Come on, I've got to find
this Docherty woman.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.873
Well, we'll have to wait
till the next work shift.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.589
- What time is it now?
- It's nearly 3:00.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.610
Time for my massage.
Who shall I have today?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.037
Tanya! Come on, sweetheart.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.615
Lucy, have you met Tanya?
She's gorgeous!

08:51.740 --> 08:53.868
Tanya, when we go to the stars,

08:53.950 --> 08:58.672
I'm going to take you to
the Catrigan Nova. Whirlpools of gold.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.798
You two should get to know each other.
That might be fun.

09:24.606 --> 09:28.110
- What the hell?
- Condition red! Repeat, condition red!

09:34.407 --> 09:37.001
- Oh, I see.
- I told you.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.913
I have one thing to say.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.842
Oh, here we go again.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.690
Isomorphic controls.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.271
Which means they only work for me.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.610
Like this!

10:07.190 --> 10:09.158
- Say sorry!
- Sorry, sorry!

10:09.234 --> 10:10.702
- Mum!
- Sorry!

10:11.778 --> 10:15.624
Didn't you learn anything
from the blessed St Martha?

10:18.535 --> 10:23.382
Siding with the Doctor
is a very dangerous thing to do.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.383
Take them away.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.132
- Move! Come on.
- Okay, got you.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.173
There you go, gramps.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.601
Oh! Do you know...

10:35.718 --> 10:39.143
I remember the days when the Doctor,

10:39.222 --> 10:44.228
Oh, that famous Doctor,
was waging a Time War,

10:44.310 --> 10:47.860
battling Sea Devils and Axons.

10:47.939 --> 10:52.319
He sealed the rift
at the Medusa Cascade single-handed!

10:54.028 --> 10:56.247
And look at him now.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.952
Stealing screwdrivers.
How did he ever come to this?

11:01.369 --> 11:02.916
Oh, yeah! Me!

11:04.205 --> 11:08.051
I just need you to listen.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.130
No, it's my turn.

11:12.046 --> 11:15.596
Revenge! Best served hot!

11:15.717 --> 11:19.642
And this time
it's a message for Miss Jones.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.322
- Professor Docherty?
- Busy.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.496
They sent word ahead. I'm Tom Milligan.
This is Martha Jones.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.545
She can be the Queen of Sheba
for all I care, I'm still busy.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.545
- Televisions don't work any more.
- Oh, God, I miss Countdown.

11:47.624 --> 11:51.094
Never been the same since Des took over.
Both Deses.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.631
What's the plural for Des?
Desii? Deseen?

11:54.756 --> 11:58.181
But we've been told
there's gonna be a transmission.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.763
From the man himself! There!

12:03.139 --> 12:05.642
My people! Salutations.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.067
On this, the eve of war. Lovely woman.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.525
But I know there 's
all sorts of whispers down there,

12:13.650 --> 12:18.156
stories of a child walking the Earth,
giving you hope.

12:20.865 --> 12:25.166
But I ask you,
how much hope has this man got?

12:26.537 --> 12:28.335
Say hello, Gandalf!

12:29.374 --> 12:33.550
Except he's not that old,
but he's an alien

12:33.628 --> 12:38.600
with a much greater lifespan
than you stunted little apes.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.851
What if it showed?

12:40.927 --> 12:44.022
What if I suspend
your capacity to regenerate?

12:47.267 --> 12:51.943
All 900 years of your life, Doctor,
what if we could see them?

12:56.442 --> 13:02.540
Older and older and older.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.041
Down you go, Doctor!

13:08.496 --> 13:10.965
Down, down.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.339
Down the years.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.103
Doctor?

14:04.427 --> 14:08.227
Received and understood, Miss Jones?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.611
I'm sorry.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.616
The Doctor's still alive.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.576
Obviously, the Archangel network

14:23.654 --> 14:26.954
would seem to be
the Master's greatest weakness.

14:27.992 --> 14:32.042
15 satellites all around the Earth
still transmitting.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.123
That's why there's so little resistance.

14:34.207 --> 14:38.337
It's broadcasting a telepathic signal
that keeps people scared.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.922
We could just take them out.

14:41.005 --> 14:44.600
We could. 15 ground-to-air missiles.
You got any on you?

14:44.675 --> 14:47.394
Besides, any military action,
the Toclafane descend.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.098
They're not called Toclafane.
That's a name the Master made up.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.273
What are they, then?

14:51.349 --> 14:54.899
Well, that's why I came to find you.
Know your enemy.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.442
I've got this.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.826
No one's been able to look at a sphere
close up. They can't even be damaged.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.747
Except once. A lightning strike in
South Africa brought one of them down.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.996
Just by chance.
I've got the readings on this.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.667
Oh!

15:12.662 --> 15:14.710
Whoever thought we'd miss Bill Gates?

15:14.831 --> 15:17.334
So is that why you travelled the world?
To find a disc?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.044
No, just got lucky.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.170
I heard stories
that you walked the Earth

15:21.295 --> 15:23.718
to find a way to build a weapon.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.686
There!

15:28.761 --> 15:31.389
"A current of 58.5 kiloamperes"

15:31.472 --> 15:35.693
"transfer a charge
of 510 megajoules precisely."

15:35.810 --> 15:39.781
- Can you recreate that?
- I think so. Easily, yes.

15:40.022 --> 15:44.027
Right then, Dr Milligan.
We're gonna get us a sphere.

16:12.555 --> 16:16.230
- He's coming! You ready?
- You do your job, I'll do mine!

16:18.436 --> 16:19.562
NOW!

16:33.034 --> 16:35.128
That's only half the job.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.215
Let's find out what's inside.

16:50.593 --> 16:54.939
I'm going kill him
if I have to wait 100 years.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.601
I'm going to kill the Master.

16:57.975 --> 17:02.697
One day, he'll let his guard down.
One day. And I'll be there.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.987
No, that's my job.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.202
I swear to you,
I'd shoot that man stone dead.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.169
I'll get him, even if it kills me.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.541
- Don't say that.
- I mean it.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.755
That man made us stand on deck
and watch the islands of Japan burning.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.635
Millions of people.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.344
I swear to you, he's dead.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.266
Tomorrow they launch.

17:41.644 --> 17:45.319
We're opening up a rift
in the Braccatolian space.

17:47.024 --> 17:51.200
- Won't see us coming. Kind of scary.
- Then stop.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.831
Once the empire is established

17:53.948 --> 17:59.000
and there's a new Gallifrey
in the heavens, maybe then it stops.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.337
The drumming.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.223
The never-ending drumbeat.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.353
Ever since I was a child,
I looked into the Vortex.

18:15.428 --> 18:19.558
That? when it chose me-
The drumming, the call to war.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.859
Can't you hear it?

18:24.145 --> 18:28.525
Listen, it's there now, right now.
Tell me you can hear it, Doctor.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.033
- Tell me.
- It's only you.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.497
Good.

18:37.617 --> 18:42.999
Tomorrow, the war./
Tomorrow we rise, never to fall!

18:43.289 --> 18:47.715
You see? I'm doing it for them.
You should be grateful.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.841
After all, you love them.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.715
So very, very much.

18:54.592 --> 18:59.974
There's some sort of magnetic clamp.
Hold on, I’ll just trip the...

19:14.070 --> 19:15.697
Oh, my God!

19:26.457 --> 19:27.925
It's alive!

19:29.043 --> 19:31.466
Martha-Martha Jones.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.385
It knows you.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.593
Sweet, kind Martha Jones.
You helped us to ﬂy.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.186
- What do you mean?
- You led us to salvation.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.356
- Who are you?
- The skies are made of diamonds.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.728
No.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.939
You can't be him.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.525
The skies are made of diamonds.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.652
We share each other's memories.
You sent him to Utopia.

19:54.777 --> 19:55.949
Oh, my God!

19:56.028 --> 19:57.780
What's it talking about? What's it mean?

19:57.905 --> 20:02.285
- What are they?
- Martha. Martha, tell us. What are they?

20:04.370 --> 20:06.919
They're us. They're humans.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.967
The human race from the future.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.504
I took Lucy to Utopia.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.138
A Time Lord and his human companion.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.481
I took her to see the stars.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

20:23.597 --> 20:28.398
Trillions of years into the future.
To the end of the universe.

20:28.811 --> 20:32.156
- Tell him what you saw.
- Dying. Everything dying.

20:32.982 --> 20:37.328
The whole of creation was falling apart.
And I thought, "There's no point."

20:37.403 --> 20:41.328
- "No point to anything. Not ever."
- And it's all your fault.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.752
I'd sort of worked it out,
with the paradox machine,

20:44.827 --> 20:46.329
because the Doctor said,

20:46.412 --> 20:48.790
on the clay before
the Master came to power, he said...

20:49.165 --> 20:50.462
When he was stealing the Tardis,

20:50.541 --> 20:54.011
the only thing I could do
was fuse the coordinates.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.223
I locked them permanently.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.388
He could only travel
between the year 100 trillion

21:00.509 --> 21:03.433
and the last place the Tardis landed.
Which is right here, right now.

21:03.679 --> 21:07.183
The Master had the Tardis,
this time machine.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.478
But the only other place he could go
was the end of the universe,

21:10.561 --> 21:11.858
so he found Utopia.

21:11.979 --> 21:16.029
You should have seen it, Doctor.
Furnaces. Burning.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.663
The last of humanity
screaming at the dark.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.624
The Utopia project was the last hope.

21:24.784 --> 21:28.038
Trying to find a way
to escape the end of everything.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.842
There was no solution. No diamonds.
Just the dark and the cold.

21:32.958 --> 21:37.304
All that human invention that had
sustained them across the aeons,

21:37.379 --> 21:40.633
it all turned inward.
They cannibalised themselves.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.309
We made ourselves so pretty.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.012
Regressing into children,
but it didn't work.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.268
The universe
was collapsing around them.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.438
But then the Master came
with his wonderful time machine,

21:50.559 --> 21:52.653
to bring us back home.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.607
But that's a paradox.
If you're the future of the human race,

21:55.689 --> 21:57.612
and you've come back
to murder your ancestors,

21:57.733 --> 22:01.283
you should cancel yourselves out.
You shouldn't exist.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.197
And that's the paradox machine.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.537
My masterpiece, Doctor.

22:09.620 --> 22:13.420
A living Tardis, strong enough
to hold the paradox in place.

22:13.499 --> 22:18.676
Allowing the past and the future
to collide in infinite majesty.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.807
But you're changing history.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.888
Not just Earth, the entire universe.

22:26.971 --> 22:30.692
I'm a Time Lord. I have that right.

22:31.559 --> 22:33.106
But even then...

22:34.311 --> 22:37.565
why come all this way just to destroy?

22:37.982 --> 22:41.782
We come backwards in time
all to build a brand-new empire

22:41.861 --> 22:44.455
lasting 700 trillion years!

22:44.947 --> 22:46.949
With me as their Master.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.832
Time Lord and humans combined.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.755
Haven't you always
dreamt of that, Doctor?

22:53.831 --> 22:56.459
What about us? We're the same species.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.170
- Why do you kill so many of us?
- Because it's fun.

23:06.802 --> 23:10.602
Human race.
Greatest monsters of them all.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.568
Night, then.

23:32.953 --> 23:36.127
I think it's time
we had the truth, Miss Jones.

23:37.249 --> 23:41.550
Legend says you travelled the world
to find a way of killing the Master.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.547
Tell us, is it true?

23:46.216 --> 23:48.844
Just before I escaped,
the Doctor told me...

23:54.058 --> 23:57.358
The Doctor and the Master,
they've been coming to Earth for years.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.109
And they've been watched.

23:59.188 --> 24:03.193
There's UNIT and Torchwood,
all studying Time Lords in secret.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.445
And they made this,
the ultimate defence.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.209
All you need is to get close,
I can shoot the Master dead with this.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.955
Actually, you can put that down now,
thank you very much.

24:12.034 --> 24:14.207
Point is, it's not so easy
to kill a Time Lord.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.790
They can regenerate,
literally bring themselves back to life.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.628
- Ah, the Master's immortal! Wonderful!
- Except for this.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.506
Four chemicals slotted into the gun.

24:25.589 --> 24:29.890
Inject him,
kills a Time Lord permanently.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.690
- Four chemicals, you've only got three.
- Still need the last one.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.732
'Cause the components of this gun
were kept safe,

24:35.849 --> 24:38.227
scattered across the world,
and I found them.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.696
San Diego, Beijing, Budapest and London.

24:40.771 --> 24:41.863
Then where is it?

24:41.939 --> 24:43.782
There's an old UNIT base
in North London.

24:43.857 --> 24:47.077
I've found the access codes.
Tom, you've got to get me there.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.495
We can't get across London in the dark.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.035
It's full of wild dogs,
we'll get eaten alive.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.834
We can wait till the morning
then go with the medical convoy.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.752
You can spend the night here,
if you like.

24:55.828 --> 24:59.082
No, we can get halfway,
stay at the slave quarters in Bexley.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.293
- Professor, thank you.
- Oh, and you. Good luck.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.636
Thanks.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.557
Martha. Could you do it?

25:13.679 --> 25:17.183
- Could you actually kill him?
- Got no choice.

25:17.266 --> 25:21.442
You might be many things,
but you don't look like a killer to me.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.587
Let me in, it's Milligan.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.348
- Did you bring food?
- Couldn't get any. And I'm starving.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.222
All we've got is water.

25:52.301 --> 25:55.555
- Sorry.
- It's cheaper than building barracks.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.639
Pack them in, 100 in each house,

25:57.723 --> 25:59.851
ferry them off
to the shipyards every morning.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.228
- Are you Martha Jones?
- Yeah, that's me.

26:02.311 --> 26:05.406
Can you kill him? They said
you can kill the Master. Can you?

26:05.481 --> 26:08.075
Tell us you can do it.
Please, tell us you can do it.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.823
Who is the Master?

26:12.362 --> 26:14.615
Come on, just leave her alone.
She's exhausted.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.575
No, it's all right.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.831
They want me to talk and I will.

26:25.667 --> 26:29.513
Access Priority One.
This is Professor Alison Docherty.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.598
State your intent.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.142
First of all,
I need to know about my son.

26:34.218 --> 26:35.891
State your intent.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.688
Is my son still alive?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.683
State your intent.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.697
I have some information for the Master.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.778
Concerning Martha Jones.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.835
Guess what?

27:04.206 --> 27:06.504
I travelled across the world.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.302
From the ruins of New York
to the Fusion Mills of China,

27:09.378 --> 27:12.257
right across
the Radiation Pits of Europe.

27:12.381 --> 27:16.602
And everywhere I went I saw people
just like you, living as slaves.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.476
But if Martha Jones became a legend,
then that's wrong,

27:19.555 --> 27:23.150
because my name isn't important.
There's someone else.

27:24.101 --> 27:28.652
The man who sent me out there.
The man who told me to walk the Earth.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.734
And his name is the Doctor.

27:32.568 --> 27:37.074
He has saved your lives so many times
and you never even knew he was there.

27:37.197 --> 27:40.076
He never stops, he never stays,

27:40.868 --> 27:43.166
he never asks to be thanked.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.590
But I've seen him. I know him.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.755
I love him.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.391
And I know what he can do.

27:55.465 --> 27:59.515
It's him! It's him! My God, it's him!
It's the Master! He's here!

27:59.595 --> 28:02.519
But he never comes to Earth!
He never walks upon the ground.

28:02.598 --> 28:03.941
Hide her!

28:17.821 --> 28:20.825
He walks among us, our Lord and Master.

28:21.033 --> 28:26.585
Martha! Martha Jones! I can see you.

28:26.872 --> 28:30.467
Out you come, little girl.
Come and meet your Master.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.476
Anybody? Nobody? No? Nothing?

28:40.260 --> 28:41.432
Positions!

28:45.682 --> 28:48.811
I'll give the order
unless you surrender.

28:48.936 --> 28:52.816
Ask yourself,
"What would the Doctor do?"

29:22.803 --> 29:27.525
Oh, yes! Oh, very well done! Good girl!

29:28.058 --> 29:29.856
He trained you well.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.235
Bag. Give me the bag.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.782
No, stay there, just throw it.

29:50.706 --> 29:53.710
And now, good companion,
your work is done.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.593
No!

30:05.554 --> 30:10.435
But you, when you die,
the Doctor should be witness, hmm?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.691
Almost dawn, Martha,

30:19.484 --> 30:23.034
and planet Earth marches to war.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.205
Citizens of Earth,
rejoice and observe.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.655
Your teleport device,
in case you thought I'd forgotten.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.785
And now

31:06.448 --> 31:07.995
kneel.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.292
Down below,
the ﬂeet is ready to launch.

31:12.412 --> 31:18.010
200,000 ships set
to burn across the universe.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.424
Are we ready?

31:23.507 --> 31:26.477
The ﬂeet awaits your signal,
rejoice!

31:27.469 --> 31:30.313
Three minutes
to align the Black Hole Converters.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.187
Counting down!

31:35.143 --> 31:37.862
I never could resist a ticking clock.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.232
My children, are you ready?

31:40.315 --> 31:45.742
We will fly and blaze and slice!
We will ﬂy and blaze and slice!

31:45.904 --> 31:48.532
At zero, to mark this day,

31:49.282 --> 31:52.252
the child, Martha Jones, will die.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.541
My first blood.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.666
Any last words? No?

32:01.628 --> 32:05.132
Such a disappointment, this one.
Days of old, Doctor,

32:05.257 --> 32:08.807
you had companions
who could absorb the Time Vortex!

32:08.885 --> 32:11.855
This one's useless! Bow your head.

32:13.014 --> 32:16.143
And so it falls to me, as Master of all,

32:16.226 --> 32:20.527
to establish from this day
a new order of Time Lords.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.232
From this day forward...

32:24.693 --> 32:27.367
What? What's so funny?

32:29.489 --> 32:31.287
- A gun?
- What about it?

32:31.366 --> 32:34.666
- A gun in four parts?
- Yes, and I destroyed it.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.042
A gun, in four parts,
scattered across the world?

32:37.164 --> 32:40.964
I mean, come on!
Did you really believe that?

32:41.042 --> 32:44.387
- What do you mean?
- As if I would ask her to kill.

32:44.713 --> 32:48.934
Oh, well, it doesn't matter.
I've got her exactly where I want her.

32:49.009 --> 32:52.058
But I knew
what Professor Docherty would do.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.016
The Resistance knew about her son.

32:55.223 --> 32:58.397
That's why I came to find you.
Know your enemy.

32:59.561 --> 33:02.314
I told her about the gun
so she'd get me here.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.367
- At the right time.
- But you're still gonna die.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.613
Don't you want to know what I was doing,
travelling the world?

33:08.695 --> 33:11.164
- Tell me.
- I told a story. That's all.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.914
No weapons, just words.
I did just what the Doctor said.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.167
I went across the continents
all on my own.

33:18.246 --> 33:22.171
And everywhere I went! found the people
and I told them my story.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.676
He has saved your lives so many times
and you never even knew he was there.

33:26.755 --> 33:27.847
I know him.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.470
I told them about the Doctor.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.843
I love him.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.928
And I told them to pass it on.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.855
To spread the word so that
everyone would know about the Doctor.

33:35.931 --> 33:40.357
- Faith and hope? Is that all?
- No, 'cause I gave them an instruction.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.362
Just as the Doctor said.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.939
Use the countdown.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.739
I told them that if everyone thinks
of one word, at one specific time...

33:47.859 --> 33:50.738
Nothing will happen!
Is that your weapon?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.249
- Prayer?
- Right across the world.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.495
One word, just one thought,
at one moment,

33:57.577 --> 34:00.251
but with 15 satellites.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.083
- What?
- The Archangel network.

34:03.166 --> 34:06.170
A telepathic field
binding the whole human race together.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.045
With all of them,
every single person on Earth,

34:08.129 --> 34:09.730
thinking the same thing
at the same time.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.433
And that word is "Doctor".

34:21.810 --> 34:25.485
Stop it. No, no, no, no, you don't.

34:28.567 --> 34:29.739
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

34:29.818 --> 34:30.989
Don't...

34:31.069 --> 34:32.491
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

34:32.571 --> 34:35.824
- Doctor.
- Doctor! Doctor!

34:35.907 --> 34:38.159
Stop this right now! Stop it!

34:39.578 --> 34:41.251
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.422
- Doctor.
- All: Doctor!

34:43.498 --> 34:47.172
I've had a whole year
to tune myself into the psychic network

34:47.252 --> 34:49.596
and integrate with its matrices.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.514
I order you to stop!

34:51.590 --> 34:54.434
Doctor!

34:57.012 --> 34:58.514
Doctor.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.523
The one thing you can't do

35:05.520 --> 35:07.363
is stop them thinking.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.571
Tell me the human race
is degenerate now,

35:14.904 --> 35:16.872
when they can do this.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.007
No!

35:26.082 --> 35:29.006
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.765
Then I'll kill them!

35:40.555 --> 35:43.855
You can't do this! You can't do...
It's not fair!

35:44.934 --> 35:47.562
- And you know what happens now.
- No!

35:49.481 --> 35:50.573
No!

35:53.401 --> 35:55.403
No! No!

35:56.363 --> 35:58.365
- You wouldn't listen.
- No!

35:58.448 --> 36:01.543
- Because you know what I'm going to say.
- No.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.754
I forgive you.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.136
My children!

36:16.216 --> 36:19.561
Protect the paradox!
Protect the paradox!

36:19.636 --> 36:21.638
Protect the paradox!

36:22.806 --> 36:25.901
- Captain, the paradox machine!
- You men, with me!

36:25.975 --> 36:27.522
You stay here.

36:28.937 --> 36:30.029
No!

36:36.277 --> 36:38.154
Now it ends, Doctor!

36:38.738 --> 36:40.365
Now it ends!

36:49.708 --> 36:51.710
We've all six billion spheres
heading right for us!

36:51.960 --> 36:54.383
We've got control of the Valiant.
You can't Launch.

36:54.462 --> 36:59.093
Oh, but I've got this.
Black Hole Convertor inside every ship.

36:59.175 --> 37:03.772
If I can't have this world, Doctor,
then neither can you.

37:03.972 --> 37:08.148
We shall stand upon this Earth
together as it burns!

37:24.951 --> 37:29.081
- Can't get in, we'd get slaughtered.
- Yeah, happens to me a lot.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.925
Weapon after weapon after weapon.

37:40.884 --> 37:43.933
All you do is talk and talk and talk.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.523
But over all these years,

37:47.724 --> 37:52.355
and all these disasters, I've always had
the greatest secret of them all.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.859
I know you.

37:55.190 --> 38:00.196
Explode those ships, you kill yourself.
That's the one thing you can never do.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.789
Give that to me.

38:41.152 --> 38:45.202
Everyone, get down! Time is reversing.

39:49.679 --> 39:52.057
The paradox is broken.
We've reverted back.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.861
One year and one clay,
two minutes past eight in the morning.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.233
This is UNIT Central,
what's happened up there?

39:58.313 --> 40:01.237
- We just saw the President assassinated.
- See.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.196
Just after the President was killed,
but just before the spheres arrived.

40:04.277 --> 40:07.406
Everything back to normal,
planet Earth restored.

40:07.488 --> 40:10.662
None of it happened.
The rockets, the terror, it never was.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.957
- What about the spheres?
- Trapped at the end of the universe.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.085
But I can remember it.

40:16.164 --> 40:20.169
We're at the eye of the storm,
the only ones who'll ever know.

40:21.252 --> 40:25.007
Oh, hello! You must be Mr Jones!
We haven't actually met.

40:26.341 --> 40:30.312
Whoa, big fella!
You don't want to miss the party. Cuffs.

40:33.681 --> 40:37.606
- So, what do we do with this one?
- We kill him.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.364
- We execute him.
- No, that's not the solution.

40:42.148 --> 40:45.243
Oh, I think so.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.953
'Cause all those things,

40:52.033 --> 40:53.876
they still happened.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.329
Because of him.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.254
- I saw them.
- Go on!

41:02.210 --> 41:03.837
Do it.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.434
Francine, you're better than him.

41:18.977 --> 41:22.072
You still haven't answered the question.
What happens to me?

41:22.146 --> 41:26.902
You're my responsibility from now on.
The only Time Lord left in existence.

41:27.568 --> 41:30.117
- Yeah, but you can't trust him.
- No.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.832
The only safe place for him
is the Tardis.

41:32.907 --> 41:36.957
You mean you're just gonna keep me?

41:37.078 --> 41:39.672
Mmm. If that's what I have to do.

41:42.250 --> 41:46.380
It's time to change.
Maybe I've been wandering for too long.

41:48.923 --> 41:51.221
Now I've got someone to care for.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.943
Put it down.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.863
There you go.
I've got you, I've got you.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.989
- Always the women.
- I didn't see her.

42:11.195 --> 42:14.244
Dying in your arms. Happy now?

42:14.323 --> 42:17.293
You're not dying, don't be stupid.
It's only a bullet, just regenerate.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.083
- No.
- One little bullet, come on.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.961
I guess you don't know me so well.
I refuse.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.420
Regenerate, just regenerate, please.
Please, just regenerate, come on!

42:26.502 --> 42:30.678
And spend the rest of my life
imprisoned with you?

42:33.968 --> 42:37.438
But you've got to.
Come on, it can't end like this.

42:38.306 --> 42:41.185
You and me. All the things we've done.

42:41.309 --> 42:44.233
Axons! Remember the Axons,
and the Daleks.

42:46.314 --> 42:50.820
We're the only two left.
There's no one else.

42:53.321 --> 42:54.743
Regenerate!

42:56.324 --> 42:58.122
How about that?

43:00.870 --> 43:02.497
I win.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.295
Will it stop, Doctor?

43:11.714 --> 43:14.513
The drumming? Will it stop?

44:55.651 --> 44:58.074
Just to say I don't blame you.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.539
But who are you?

45:13.044 --> 45:17.220
Time was every single one
of these people knew your name.

45:18.424 --> 45:21.143
- Now they've all forgotten you.
- Good.

45:22.136 --> 45:25.140
- Back to work.
- I really don't mind, though.

45:25.306 --> 45:26.808
Come with me.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.644
Had plenty of time to think
that past year.

45:29.769 --> 45:31.817
The year that never was.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.492
And I kept thinking
about that team of mine.

45:38.069 --> 45:41.073
Like you said, Doctor. Responsibility.

45:41.697 --> 45:44.667
Defending the Earth.
Can't argue with that.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.294
Hey, I need that!

45:47.370 --> 45:50.840
I can't have you walking round
with a time-travelling teleport.

45:50.957 --> 45:54.928
You could go anywhere. Twice.
Second time to apologise.

45:55.378 --> 45:58.382
And what about me? Can you fix that?
Will I ever be able to die?

45:58.506 --> 46:02.636
Nothing I can do.
You're an impossible thing, jack.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.763
Been called that before.

46:10.351 --> 46:11.523
Sir.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.272
Ma'am.

46:18.025 --> 46:20.824
But I keep wondering, what about ageing?

46:21.195 --> 46:23.618
'Cause I can't die,
but I keep getting older,

46:23.698 --> 46:26.326
the odd little grey hair, you know.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.370
What happens
if I live for a million years?

46:29.453 --> 46:31.706
I really don't know.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.463
Okay, vanity, sorry. Yeah.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.970
Can't help it. Used to be a poster boy!

46:38.045 --> 46:41.845
When I was a kid,
living in the Boeshane Peninsula,

46:41.924 --> 46:43.801
tiny little place.

46:43.884 --> 46:47.479
I was the first one ever
to be signed up for the Time Agency.

46:47.555 --> 46:51.355
They were so proud of me.
The Face of Boe they called me.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.979
I'll see you.

46:58.357 --> 46:59.734
No.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.612
Can't be.

47:03.154 --> 47:06.033
No. Definitely not. No.

47:09.952 --> 47:11.124
No!

47:59.960 --> 48:02.304
Yeah, could you put me through?

48:06.592 --> 48:09.641
Hi, I'm looking for
a Dr Thomas Milligan.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.901
Yeah? Hello?

48:16.143 --> 48:17.395
Hello?

48:31.617 --> 48:34.336
Right then! Off we go. The open road!

48:34.412 --> 48:38.417
There is a burst of starfire right now
over the coast of Meta Sigmafolio.

48:38.499 --> 48:41.799
Oh, the sky is like oil on water.

48:42.169 --> 48:44.888
Fancy a look? Or back in time.
We could...

48:44.964 --> 48:47.513
I don't know, Charles II? Henry VIII?

48:47.591 --> 48:50.185
I know, what about Agatha Christie!

48:50.428 --> 48:54.023
I'd love to meet Agatha Christie,
bet she's brilliant!

48:57.351 --> 48:58.853
Okay.

48:59.812 --> 49:01.655
- I just can't.
- Yeah.

49:03.816 --> 49:05.910
I've spent all these years
training to be a doctor,

49:05.985 --> 49:08.909
and now I've got people to look after.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.657
They saw half the planet slaughtered
and they're devastated.

49:11.740 --> 49:14.289
- I can't leave them.
- Course not.

49:24.503 --> 49:25.880
Thank you.

49:36.140 --> 49:39.314
- Martha Jones, you saved the world.
- Yes, I did.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.321
I spent a lot of time with you
thinking I was second best,

49:42.396 --> 49:44.740
but you know what?

49:44.857 --> 49:46.575
I am good.

49:49.653 --> 49:52.577
- You going to be all right?
- Always, yeah.

49:53.574 --> 49:54.996
Right, then.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.077
Bye.

50:15.095 --> 50:17.268
'Cause the thing is,
it's like my friend Vicky.

50:17.389 --> 50:19.141
She lived with this bloke,
student housing,

50:19.266 --> 50:22.395
there were five of them, all packed in,
and this bloke was called Shaun.

50:22.478 --> 50:26.324
And she loved him, she did,
she completely adored him,

50:26.440 --> 50:28.442
spent all day long talking about him...

50:28.526 --> 50:30.824
- Is this going anywhere?
- Yes.

50:31.612 --> 50:34.206
'Cause he never looked at her twice.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.582
I mean, he liked her, that was it.

50:40.955 --> 50:44.209
And she wasted years pining after him,
years of her life,

50:44.291 --> 50:46.965
'cause while he was around,
she never looked at anyone else.

50:47.044 --> 50:51.299
And I told her, I always said to her,
time and time again, I said,

50:51.882 --> 50:53.725
"Get out."

50:59.598 --> 51:02.317
So this is me... getting out.

51:10.317 --> 51:13.491
Keep that.
'Cause I'm not having you disappear!

51:13.988 --> 51:18.334
If that rings, when that rings,
you'd better come running, got it?

51:18.409 --> 51:19.661
Got it.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.668
I'll see you again, mister.

52:29.021 --> 52:30.898
What?

52:32.316 --> 52:33.659
What?

52:41.075 --> 52:42.543
What?
