Anyone could see that.

01:03.662 --> 01:06.547
And it was obvious that this would
be nothing short

01:06.651 --> 01:08.027
of a whirlwind romance.

01:08.182 --> 01:10.387
Nothing was going
to keep us apart.

01:14.332 --> 01:16.907
Dean Papadopoulos, I love you.

01:17.052 --> 01:19.626
And I think you feel the
same way about me.

01:19.721 --> 01:20.721
Don't you?

01:28.262 --> 01:30.307
I can't believe this
is finally happening.

01:34.391 --> 01:35.725
What are you doing?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.446
Dean.

01:39.591 --> 01:40.591
Is that my hat?

01:43.630 --> 01:45.925
Did you make me into
your snow boyfriend?

01:46.031 --> 01:48.725
No! I was just practicing.

Come on, let's go, you guys.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.053
Katie Lou Decks
told me what happened.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.053
I'm sorry, Sarah.

02:28.328 --> 02:29.513
Dean's a jerk.

02:33.967 --> 02:36.103
Thanks, Nick.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.303
Come on.

02:41.008 --> 02:42.183
Come on!

02:45.048 --> 02:46.103
What are you doing?

02:47.258 --> 02:48.258
Just help me.

03:00.767 --> 03:03.903
Forget about Dean.
You could have any one you want.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.208
He can be short.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.023
Or tall.

03:12.128 --> 03:13.903
If that's what you like.

03:15.048 --> 03:17.183
I like tall. And smart.

03:17.208 --> 03:19.583
Great. Bigger brain.

03:23.458 --> 03:25.822
What else? Somebody brave.

03:25.928 --> 03:27.153
Oh, and romantic.

03:35.897 --> 03:37.942
Someone who can sweep me
off my feet.

03:42.767 --> 03:46.072
And nice. And can make me laugh.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.942
Well, there you go.

03:57.048 --> 03:58.622
Everything you want is right there.

03:58.767 --> 04:01.942
Thanks, Nick.
You're a really good friend.

Let's do this every year,
and one day,

04:08.998 --> 04:11.303
when I finally meet
my dream boyfriend,

04:11.458 --> 04:15.433
we won't have to build him any more.
Now all it needs is a name.

04:15.538 --> 04:16.822
What about Cole?

04:20.048 --> 04:21.742
Yeah, I like Cole.

04:22.847 --> 04:25.184
We'd better take a picture.
You don't want to forget the day

04:25.208 --> 04:26.448
you found a guy of your dreams.

04:32.998 --> 04:35.583
Now all we have to do is
wait. Who knows?

04:35.717 --> 04:37.513
Maybe we won't have to
build it next year.

04:54.887 --> 04:56.223

Hi.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.543
Morning, dad. Hey, kid.

06:13.369 --> 06:16.249
This looks great. Yeah, I'm using that
stain you got me for Father's Day.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.451
It's fantastic.
And you shouldn't have done it.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.880
You need to be spending
your money on yourself.

06:20.905 --> 06:22.171
It was practically free.

06:22.266 --> 06:24.601
From Italy. Need any help?

06:24.706 --> 06:26.521
No, Herb and I have it covered.

06:26.626 --> 06:28.241
Herb, can I get a clean rag?

06:32.296 --> 06:33.732
Are you sure you don't want my help?

06:33.756 --> 06:35.351
Well, Herb likes to stay useful.

06:36.546 --> 06:39.351
This table's going to be ready in a
few days. Do you think you can

06:39.546 --> 06:43.271
put it online over the weekend? Of course.
Heading into the office early?

06:43.376 --> 06:45.760
No, um, heading to Nick's.

06:45.865 --> 06:48.561
I thought we'd catch up and...

06:48.706 --> 06:51.760
...have coffee.
I know what that means.

06:51.865 --> 06:53.321
You broke up with Brian.

06:54.655 --> 06:56.960
Yeah. Can't say I'm surprised.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.041
Though you did just start dating.

06:59.146 --> 07:00.271
It's been three weeks.

07:00.426 --> 07:03.271
There's no spark. I figured
I'd let him down gently

07:03.426 --> 07:06.601
before it gets too close to
Christmas and I chicken out.

07:09.756 --> 07:13.960
I don't want to settle for someone just
to have someone to kiss on New Year's Eve.

07:13.985 --> 07:15.630
I don't want you to just
settle either.

07:15.785 --> 07:19.481
But I'm worried that you're
too focused on the spark.

07:19.586 --> 07:21.630
Sometimes love is just a slow burn.

07:21.756 --> 07:22.811
I know.

07:24.266 --> 07:27.271
But I've been waiting my whole life
for someone to sweep me off my feet.

07:27.376 --> 07:28.991
I'm not giving up now.

07:32.196 --> 07:33.601
You and Mom set the bar too high.

07:34.706 --> 07:35.991
I just want what you guys had.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.916
As far as break-ups go, you've
definitely had worse.

07:47.422 --> 07:50.037
Except for the part where the waiter
spilt the soup all over the guy.

07:50.061 --> 07:52.227
Ugh. Yeah, that wasn't great.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.557
Yeah. All right.
I think I've finished.

08:00.102 --> 08:01.357
Sadly, that's pretty accurate.

08:02.811 --> 08:05.477
Yup, another for the Hall of Fame.

08:05.611 --> 08:07.867
You know, you keep burning through
boyfriends like this,

08:08.022 --> 08:10.502
I'm going to have to get another
hard drive to store all those.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.757
If you weren't my best friend,
I'd actually be offended.

08:12.861 --> 08:14.687
I hate to break it to you,

08:14.811 --> 08:18.327
but I'm just way too cool to be your
best friend. Too cool? Yeah, OK!

08:19.611 --> 08:21.397
I always forget how
good you are.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.916
Yeah, you and everyone else.

08:23.061 --> 08:25.437
I take it all isn't well in
the world of cartooning?

08:25.582 --> 08:27.916
Well, I sent out a comic strip
to a few publications.

08:28.022 --> 08:29.117
Got a couple of responses.

08:29.222 --> 08:30.687
Yeah? What did they say?

08:30.811 --> 08:33.116
If I printed them off, I'd have
enough rejection letters

08:33.142 --> 08:34.381
to wallpaper this entire place.

08:39.381 --> 08:40.381
Try this one.

08:44.582 --> 08:45.586
Are you serious?

08:46.741 --> 08:50.861
I showed my boss some of your work and she wants to
meet with you about doing some art for the magazine.

08:51.741 --> 08:53.867
You did this? You did!

08:54.022 --> 08:56.677
You're awesome.
I just made sure she found out.

08:57.991 --> 09:00.557
Maybe we'll get to work
on something together.

09:00.662 --> 09:01.786
Yeah, I'd like that.

09:05.662 --> 09:09.836
I mean, this is good and all, but I
definitely prefer your other work.

09:11.142 --> 09:12.197
Yeah.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.916
You're good, though?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.947
Yeah. It was...

09:17.061 --> 09:18.836
It was my decision, but still.

09:18.941 --> 09:20.677
Break-ups are the worst.

09:22.252 --> 09:24.327
Here's to another Christmas
being single.

09:29.702 --> 09:32.716
You know, I gotta say, you really
ran this one down to the wire.

09:32.811 --> 09:34.277
It's December 12th!

09:34.382 --> 09:35.716
Hello? Wow!

09:35.811 --> 09:36.867
I almost forgot.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.397
Looks like it's another
Christmas building my snow beau.

09:40.502 --> 09:41.757
Yeah.

09:41.861 --> 09:44.327
I should get to work. Right.

09:51.142 --> 09:52.557
Thanks for listening.

09:54.452 --> 09:55.867
You're a great friend, Nick.

09:58.502 --> 09:59.502
See you tonight?

10:04.422 --> 10:05.422
Yeah.

10:09.222 --> 10:10.222
Great friend.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.757
Good morning.

10:27.382 --> 10:28.557
Good morning, Isabel.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.197
Oh, morning, Sarah!

10:30.342 --> 10:32.966
You want some elk jerky?
100% home-made.

10:33.061 --> 10:35.117
Fired up the smoker this weekend.

10:35.222 --> 10:36.997
No, I'm good. Thanks, though.

10:37.142 --> 10:41.477
OK. Let me know if you change your
mind, though, because I got, like...

10:41.502 --> 10:42.836
...like 90lb of it at home.

10:42.941 --> 10:45.637
Wow. Elks are huge.

10:45.782 --> 10:49.836
So, I did it. I ended things with
Brian.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.677
Oh, really? I'm sorry.

10:51.782 --> 10:54.427
You OK? Yeah. It was for the best.

10:54.582 --> 10:56.867
It's not like he was
the one or anything.

10:58.061 --> 10:59.117
I'm not crazy, am I?

10:59.222 --> 11:00.757
For wanting that bolt of lightning?

11:02.092 --> 11:03.786
Well, I've been struck
by lightning before.

11:03.941 --> 11:06.557
Citrus fruit tastes
like pennies now.

11:06.662 --> 11:08.277
Am I giving guys enough of a chance?

11:08.422 --> 11:12.277
Like, does that spark need time to
flare up into a raging fire?

11:12.422 --> 11:15.637
Yeah, I've been caught in
a forest fire, too.

11:15.782 --> 11:17.786
It was like right
after the lightning strike.

11:17.892 --> 11:19.757
That was not a good day.

11:19.892 --> 11:21.966
Like, I want excitement.
I want adventure.

11:22.061 --> 11:23.507
Is that too much to ask?

11:24.811 --> 11:27.677
Well, here. This jerky will take
you on a flavour adventure.

11:30.582 --> 11:32.227
(INTERCOM BUZZER)

11:32.382 --> 11:34.227
Sarah, can I see you in
my office, please?

11:34.342 --> 11:35.966
You know how much I love your work.

11:36.092 --> 11:37.836
You're one of the
best writers we've got.

11:37.972 --> 11:40.637
Frankly, Twin Cities Life wouldn't
be the same without you.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.916
Thank you.

11:42.061 --> 11:44.357
Wait, you're not cheerfully firing
me, are you?

11:44.382 --> 11:45.786
Oh, my gosh, no, no.

11:45.941 --> 11:47.701
I'm so sorry. That's not
what I meant at all.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.507
What I wanted to talk to you about
was the e-mail you sent me,

11:50.662 --> 11:54.066
regarding your request for more
diverse assignments.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.756
The travel section?

11:55.891 --> 11:58.356
Well, I think it would make a great
addition to the magazine.

11:58.501 --> 12:01.066
Give our readers a taste of all
things to explore in the world.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.835
And honestly, I would jump at the
chance to pursue travel writing.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.506
This is Twin Cities Life.

12:06.701 --> 12:11.396
I mean, I think a travel section is just
a teensy bit outside of the magazine's scope.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.866
Oh. And your leisure articles
are so great.

12:15.021 --> 12:16.981
It's like you know the
Twin Cities inside and out.

12:17.091 --> 12:19.556
That's what happens when
you never leave.

12:19.701 --> 12:21.915
Exactly! I mean, who better to write
about

12:22.060 --> 12:24.946
all the amazing things to do
in St Paul and Minneapolis

12:25.091 --> 12:28.146
than somebody who's never been
outside the city limits?

12:28.251 --> 12:29.426
Right.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.116
Uh, I hear you.

12:32.661 --> 12:35.485
I'll stick to what I know.
I knew you'd understand.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.781
You're so great,
Sarah, you know that?

12:39.297 --> 12:40.942
Thanks.

12:53.297 --> 12:55.031
Dad? I'm in here!

12:59.167 --> 13:00.967
Here, let me, let me help
you with that, Herb.

13:09.717 --> 13:11.051
Rough clay?

13:11.157 --> 13:12.572
Yeah, you could say that.

13:12.717 --> 13:17.082
Well, broke up with Brian,
got shut down by my boss,

13:17.107 --> 13:19.332
and later tonight I'll
be building a snowman,

13:19.467 --> 13:21.132
which will serve as a lifelong
reminder

13:21.237 --> 13:22.772
that I've never had anything close

13:22.907 --> 13:24.931
to resembling a romantic,
long-term relationship.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.601
That's one way of looking at it.

13:28.797 --> 13:32.242
Or you dumped your boyfriend because
you weren't right for each other.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.413
From what you tell me on the phone, your
boss is very pleased with your work.

13:35.437 --> 13:37.692
And later tonight you're going to
see your best friend

13:37.826 --> 13:40.801
and partake in a Christmas tradition
that dates back almost 20 years.

13:40.956 --> 13:43.931
You're not supposed to poke holes in
my whining.

13:44.076 --> 13:46.601
It's your fault I'm so wistful,
you know.

13:46.746 --> 13:50.242
Oh, this should be good!
Well, you and Mom met in Paris!

13:50.387 --> 13:52.931
You spent your first year together
travelling Europe.

13:53.076 --> 13:56.082
How am I supposed to be content with
Brian and St Paul, Minnesota?

13:58.157 --> 14:01.082
Dad, do you ever
think about leaving?

14:02.290 --> 14:03.426
Doesn't it make you sad,

14:03.581 --> 14:06.785
staying here?
Sleeping in the same bed?

14:08.251 --> 14:10.035
It's been almost ten years.

14:10.171 --> 14:12.476
You know, there's still
not a day that goes by

14:12.501 --> 14:13.866
that I don't miss your mother.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.346
But leaving behind the
life we built?

14:17.501 --> 14:19.866
It's not going to make me
miss her any less.

14:20.021 --> 14:22.996
When you first saw her,
you knew, didn't you?

14:24.171 --> 14:25.866
All I want is to feel
the same thing.

14:27.341 --> 14:29.955
Do you really think I'm going to
find that if I stay here?

14:30.091 --> 14:32.835
It's not about where
you are, sweetie.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.676
It's about who you're with.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.835
Oh, Dad... l

14:37.980 --> 14:39.785
Come on. I want to
show you something.

14:47.701 --> 14:50.915
I never told you this, but the night
before I met your mother,

14:51.021 --> 14:54.066
I made a wish. You did?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.785
It was Christmas Eve.

14:57.891 --> 14:59.785
I was alone in Paris.

14:59.891 --> 15:01.226
The city of love.

15:02.891 --> 15:05.426
So I wished that I'd
find the love of my life...

15:07.501 --> 15:09.396
...and the next day I saw her.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.915
And she was wearing this.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.396
That's the first thing I noticed
about her,

15:15.581 --> 15:20.585
this bright red scarf in a sea of blacks
and greys in the streets of Paris.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.196
If it hadn't been for this,
I might never have seen her.

15:31.141 --> 15:32.866
You have your mother's heart.

15:33.011 --> 15:36.316
Who knows? Maybe this will work its
magic on you like it did with her.

15:40.341 --> 15:41.866
Thanks, Dad.

15:43.980 --> 15:45.035
(MOBILE VIBRATES)

15:46.421 --> 15:47.835
Oh, it's Nick. He's outside.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.226
See? It's working already.

15:49.341 --> 15:50.866
Dad!

15:50.980 --> 15:53.636
It's Nick. We tried that once.

15:53.781 --> 15:55.346
Didn't work. Oh, sure,
in high school.

15:55.451 --> 15:57.346
But you were kids. And no offense,

15:57.501 --> 15:59.396
but you were both kind
of obnoxious back then.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.556
Go on.

16:03.661 --> 16:04.835
Don't keep him waiting.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.196
Let's go! Hurry up.

16:14.301 --> 16:15.506
It's freezing.

16:18.091 --> 16:19.346
Hey, nice scarf.

16:21.221 --> 16:24.035
Those the goods?
Yup, straight from my closet.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.731
Anything you could possibly need to
build the man of your dreams.

16:26.781 --> 16:28.146
Let's get to work.

16:33.371 --> 16:36.316
OK. He's a blank canvas.

16:36.421 --> 16:38.066
We've got a lot of options.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.506
Hit me.

16:40.980 --> 16:44.346
He's got to be adventurous, not
afraid to go off the beaten path. OK.

16:44.501 --> 16:46.835
Maybe his job lets him travel,
see the world.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.636
Nothing says adventure like flannel.

16:51.531 --> 16:55.066
What's next? This goes without
saying, but he's got to be gorgeous.

16:55.171 --> 16:57.426
Charming. A perfect gentleman.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.317
Are you drawing abs on our snowman?

17:01.341 --> 17:03.316
Don't judge me! OK!

17:03.451 --> 17:05.954
He's got to be smart
but not arrogant, sweet,

17:06.090 --> 17:08.835
down to earth. And he's got to make
me laugh.

17:14.171 --> 17:15.316
Well now he's perfect.

17:17.980 --> 17:20.425
I'd want him to
be incredibly romantic.

17:20.531 --> 17:21.531
Someone who will...

17:21.621 --> 17:24.116
Sweep you off your feet.

17:24.261 --> 17:26.556
I know, you've been saying this
for 20 years!

17:26.651 --> 17:27.675
OK.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.346
Anything else?

17:31.421 --> 17:34.955
I want excitement.
I want my heart to be set on fire.

17:36.810 --> 17:38.626
When I look in his eyes,
I want to know.

17:42.621 --> 17:46.556
Uh, yeah... I don't have
anything for that.

17:57.251 --> 17:58.346
Come on.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.066
Come on.

18:12.141 --> 18:14.316
Hey, smile, come on!

18:22.301 --> 18:25.556
Most of all, I wish this is finally
the year I meet the man of my dreams.

18:27.301 --> 18:30.476
That, come Christmas,
I'll be in love.

18:37.341 --> 18:38.476
You good?

18:40.091 --> 18:41.091
Yeah.

18:42.581 --> 18:43.705
Just tired.

18:45.730 --> 18:47.330
Think I'm going to call
it a night. Yeah.

18:48.730 --> 18:49.835
Text you tomorrow?

18:53.730 --> 18:54.730
Night, Nick.

18:57.171 --> 18:58.266
Goodnight.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.035
Mom.

20:30.681 --> 20:32.176
Hey, morning, kid.

20:32.271 --> 20:33.966
Morning, Dad. This smells good.

20:34.071 --> 20:36.096
You're awfully chipper.

20:36.241 --> 20:38.536
Here I was worried about you
after we talked last night.

20:38.561 --> 20:39.966
I'll admit I was a bit morose,

20:40.121 --> 20:42.816
but it's just a symptom of December
12th that I've dealt with for the

20:42.840 --> 20:45.656
better part of my life. I'm glad
you're feeling better...

20:45.761 --> 20:46.935
It's a zit.

20:47.071 --> 20:48.815
I woke up with it.
But, yeah, I mean,

20:48.960 --> 20:51.406
who cares if I don't fall in
love by Christmas?

20:51.511 --> 20:53.216
I have you, St Paul is fine,

20:53.351 --> 20:56.126
and if I need a change of
scenery I can go to Minneapolis.

20:56.241 --> 20:58.846
Over there, somewhere.

20:58.991 --> 21:02.456
And if I get lonely over the
holidays, I can just get a turtle.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.096
I'll be a turtle lady.

21:04.201 --> 21:05.486
Clearly, you're not fine.

21:05.601 --> 21:07.096
I'm better than fine.

21:07.201 --> 21:08.885
I guess that explains the snowman.

21:08.991 --> 21:10.176
Yeah, it does.

21:10.271 --> 21:12.246
Wait, what are you talking about?

21:12.401 --> 21:14.846
I was surprised, this is the
first time in 20 years I

21:14.991 --> 21:17.326
haven't seen him
in our front yard on December 13th.

21:17.351 --> 21:19.406
Didn't you and Nick
make one last night?

21:20.960 --> 21:23.015
If someone tore down our snowman...

21:23.121 --> 21:25.486
I'm sure there's an explanation.

21:25.681 --> 21:28.967
Probably Dean Papadopoulos Jr, who's an even
bigger bag of rocks than his clad was at

21:28.991 --> 21:31.765
his age. When I find him,
I'm going to claw out his...

21:31.871 --> 21:33.126
...eyes.

21:33.241 --> 21:35.246
Hi.

21:35.351 --> 21:36.351
Hi.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.815
I just happened to be passing by
when I spotted this.

21:40.910 --> 21:42.736
My scarf.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.015
Here.

21:47.271 --> 21:49.216
Suits you. It's beautiful.

21:52.561 --> 21:57.406
Oh, sorry, I probably look like
I just rolled out of bed.

21:57.511 --> 21:59.846
Um... No, no. Here.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.576
You look wonderful.

22:02.681 --> 22:04.736
Thanks.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.126
Uh...

22:06.271 --> 22:09.266
I don't know how to thank you...
Cole.

22:10.571 --> 22:11.626
Cole?

22:12.891 --> 22:14.066
And you are? I

22:14.171 --> 22:16.116
Sarah. Sarah.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.691
It's a pleasure to meet you, Sarah.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.596
Your hands are freezing.

22:21.701 --> 22:23.196
Oh, sorry, I forgot my gloves,

22:23.341 --> 22:25.346
practically have
icicles for fingers.

22:26.860 --> 22:28.596
As for thanking me...

22:28.701 --> 22:29.701
How about lunch?

22:30.860 --> 22:33.546
You want to go to lunch?
Yes, I do, with you.

22:33.651 --> 22:35.835
Wow, uh, OK.

22:37.291 --> 22:40.035
I just work downtown at
Twin Cities Life, so...

22:40.171 --> 22:43.866
Around noon? Yeah, that's great,
I'll pick you up at noon.

22:43.980 --> 22:46.035
Great, good, sounds good.

22:46.141 --> 22:47.426
Great. I

22:47.531 --> 22:48.835
Thank you. I

22:59.261 --> 23:00.905
Sarah, Sarah!

23:01.011 --> 23:02.596
Nick! Good morning.

23:03.810 --> 23:06.785
Scratch that, great morning.
What's got you in such a good mood?

23:06.891 --> 23:08.396
It finally happened.

23:08.531 --> 23:11.035
What are you talking about?
That bolt of lightning struck.

23:11.221 --> 23:14.061
A bolt of lightning? That feeling that
I've been waiting for since I was

23:14.141 --> 23:16.955
11 years old, I'd given up
on it, and then I met him.

23:18.221 --> 23:20.346
What him? Cole.

23:20.371 --> 23:22.596
Wait, Cole, like our snowman Cole?

23:22.701 --> 23:23.705
Crazy. Right?

23:24.980 --> 23:27.146
It's like it's a sign from the
universe or something.

23:27.341 --> 23:31.066
Yeah, or it's a sign that he's a social media
stalker with highly questionable motives.

23:31.171 --> 23:33.426
He's not a stalker, he's gorgeous.

23:33.451 --> 23:34.986
And kind and thoughtful.

23:35.091 --> 23:36.785
He brought back my mom's scarf.

23:36.930 --> 23:39.316
Your mom's scarf? Someone toppled
over our snowman...

23:39.501 --> 23:42.786
What? ..And I guess he found it in the
street or something. Your hat's gone forever.

23:42.810 --> 23:44.785
OK, but what happened to our
snowman?

23:44.901 --> 23:47.516
Nick, who cares about the snowman?

23:47.651 --> 23:50.236
For the first time in my
life, I feel that flame.

23:51.371 --> 23:54.116
He's taking me to lunch and I
don't even know anything about him.

23:54.261 --> 23:55.955
It's so exciting
and mysterious and...

23:56.060 --> 23:57.506
Potentially deadly.

23:57.651 --> 23:59.626
I promise to tell you all
about it after work.

24:01.141 --> 24:02.426
Wait, are you going inside?

24:03.651 --> 24:05.186
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

24:05.341 --> 24:06.981
Oh, right. Your boss, yeah,
you set it up.

24:07.011 --> 24:09.346
That's great! OK then, let's go.

24:17.421 --> 24:20.426
Wow, tall, handsome, flannel!

24:20.531 --> 24:22.596
Oh, sign me up. I

24:24.261 --> 24:25.955
So, when does he get here?

24:26.060 --> 24:27.426
We said lunch, so...

24:27.531 --> 24:28.785
Soon.

24:29.901 --> 24:33.785
OK, then I am going to eat at my
desk so that I don't miss anything.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.186
Do you want an elk sandwich to
tide you over?

24:36.341 --> 24:41.476
Hi, ladies. I hate to intrude, but,
Sarah, can I steal you for a sec?

24:41.571 --> 24:43.035
Course.

24:43.141 --> 24:44.626
Great. I

24:54.882 --> 24:59.387
Hey. Hey. Sarah, Nick, thank
you for being here.

24:59.492 --> 25:00.776
Yeah, yeah, of course.

25:02.162 --> 25:03.537
Um...

25:03.642 --> 25:05.057
Did we have a meeting in the books?

25:05.202 --> 25:08.946
No, I was just talking to Nick,
and...

25:09.051 --> 25:11.417
I just love his work.

25:11.562 --> 25:14.387
I was thinking we could use his
talents in the Christmas issue,

25:14.522 --> 25:17.337
and since you two are
such good friends, I figured,

25:17.442 --> 25:19.107
who better to team him up with?

25:19.202 --> 25:21.257
Congratulations, Sarah,

25:21.442 --> 25:24.337
you are going to be writing the feature
story for the Christmas issue of

25:24.492 --> 25:27.417
Twin Cities Life. That's,
that's amazing, thank you.

25:27.562 --> 25:30.507
And, Nick, you're going to be
illustrating all of it.

25:31.692 --> 25:35.257
Now, you're going to have to crack
the angle of it but I trust you.

25:35.412 --> 25:37.467
Yeah, we'll start hashing
that out right away.

25:37.612 --> 25:41.977
Now, let me remind you how
important the Christmas issue is.

25:42.002 --> 25:45.026
Our subscription renewals happen at
the end of the year,

25:45.162 --> 25:47.387
so the feature
story is the crown jewel.

25:48.841 --> 25:51.417
You feeling up to it? Definitely.

25:51.522 --> 25:53.417
Oh, yeah, we won't let you down.

25:53.522 --> 25:55.057
I'll let you two get at it.

25:55.202 --> 25:57.696
Let's talk story ideas
first thing tomorrow morning.

25:57.801 --> 25:59.977
That's, that's not a lot of time.

26:00.132 --> 26:02.337
Like at all.
I knew I could count on you.

26:05.921 --> 26:07.337
Wow.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.417
Congratulations. Congratulations.

26:09.522 --> 26:11.417
Hey, a featured story, that's great.

26:11.532 --> 26:13.177
And look at you getting published.

26:13.282 --> 26:14.617
Thanks to you.

26:16.132 --> 26:18.026
OK, well, let's get started I guess.

26:18.132 --> 26:20.337
Oh, I can't, um, it's almost noon.

26:20.442 --> 26:22.747
Right. Hot date.

26:22.772 --> 26:25.492
And I have to work on a story for
the rest of the day but let's start

26:25.522 --> 26:29.587
brainstorming tonight. I can
come over and we can have dinner.

26:29.692 --> 26:30.696
Seven?

26:31.772 --> 26:33.696
Sure. That sounds good.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.307
I'm really glad we're doing this.

26:35.412 --> 26:36.776
It's going to be fun.

26:36.921 --> 26:40.417
My God, Sarah, you have to come
outside and see this.

26:40.522 --> 26:42.696
Hey, Nick. Seriously. Come on.

26:48.801 --> 26:49.801
Cole?

26:51.971 --> 26:54.307
Good afternoon, Sarah. Are you
ready for lunch?

26:56.162 --> 26:58.387
He picked you up in a carriage?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.107
Yeah, he did!

27:05.162 --> 27:06.896
I got this for you.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.257
Thank you.

27:08.362 --> 27:10.896
OK, this is ridiculous.

27:11.002 --> 27:13.617
Where are we going? On an adventure.

27:35.282 --> 27:37.747
Check out that deer.

27:40.642 --> 27:43.178
I paid that deer to walk through
right there, so you could see it!

27:43.202 --> 27:44.507
The reindeer?

27:47.051 --> 27:49.896
I ordered the sun for today, I hope
you're good with the temperature.

27:50.051 --> 27:53.057
Yeah, it's, it's
nice with this fur.

27:53.162 --> 27:55.026
I got this for you.

27:55.162 --> 27:57.162
Did you study that in like
Boy Scouts or something?

27:57.252 --> 27:59.946
It's an ancient recipe.
You made this?

28:00.051 --> 28:01.977
Yeah. Wow, OK.

28:06.921 --> 28:09.177
Man, it's good. Thank you.

28:16.642 --> 28:19.227
It was a beautiful
carriage you showed up in.

28:19.362 --> 28:21.337
The hot chocolate was
a nice touch, too.

28:21.442 --> 28:23.177
Thank you. Thanks.

28:23.282 --> 28:24.696
I'm glad that you liked it.

28:24.801 --> 28:26.107
Thank you. I

28:28.892 --> 28:30.057
Whoa. I

28:32.282 --> 28:33.417
What's wrong?

28:34.892 --> 28:37.227
Nothing. Nothing, I...

28:37.332 --> 28:39.587
Do you find it warm in here? No.

28:39.721 --> 28:42.337
It must just be me then, I'm
probably just a little nervous.

28:43.801 --> 28:47.227
OK, so now that you've heard the ups
and downs of writing for the online

28:47.362 --> 28:49.667
lifestyle magazine, now
it's your turn.

28:49.692 --> 28:51.747
What do you do for a living? Er...

28:54.654 --> 28:57.095
Have you ever heard
of extreme tourism?

28:57.280 --> 29:01.615
Yeah, it's basically travelling to dangerous
places and doing dangerous things.

29:01.770 --> 29:04.415
Well, you pretty much hit
the nail on the head, yes!

29:04.560 --> 29:08.335
OK. I work for an agency that
coordinates extreme tourism trips.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.135
So my job is to basically go in,

29:10.280 --> 29:13.814
find the most treacherous and
remote areas in the world and lead

29:13.969 --> 29:15.455
expeditions to them,
and through them.

29:15.610 --> 29:19.615
That sounds crazy.
I know, and I love it.

29:19.770 --> 29:21.975
So where have you been?
All over the world.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.885
OK, my particular niche is polar
exploration.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.765
So if it's dangerously cold, chances
are I've probably been there.

29:27.910 --> 29:31.555
I mean, you name it. Russia, Alaska,
Winnipeg, Antarctica.

29:31.660 --> 29:33.115
Pretty much have ice in my veins.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.555
So what brings you here?

29:34.660 --> 29:36.964
I come home every Christmas.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.405
You're from St Paul?
Yeah, I was born here.

29:39.430 --> 29:40.885
What?! Yeah, I know.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.044
I mean, truth be told, I traveled a
lot growing up so it doesn't really

29:44.180 --> 29:47.794
feel like home when I'm here,
although I was shaped here.

29:47.939 --> 29:51.245
But... I still kind of feel like a
tourist, I guess.

29:51.380 --> 29:53.964
Well, if you're looking for someone
to show you the sights,

29:54.069 --> 29:56.765
I think I'm uniquely qualified.

29:56.859 --> 29:58.195
I might just take you up on that.

29:58.350 --> 30:00.995
You should. I've been
here my entire life.

30:01.140 --> 30:05.155
I'd love to travel and see the
world.

30:06.859 --> 30:08.405
But, you know, sometimes...

30:10.020 --> 30:13.275
I feel like I'm just
stuck standing still.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.500
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

30:18.540 --> 30:21.405
So why don't you leave? I've tried.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.765
But everything I know is here.

30:23.910 --> 30:27.075
I've got so many memories
and people anchoring me here.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.155
Maybe you just need the
right gust of wind.

30:34.910 --> 30:36.834
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

31:05.910 --> 31:07.275
Well, I had a wonderful time.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.885
Me too. I

31:09.020 --> 31:11.275
I should get back to work.
Yes, of course.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.325
Oh, oh! I

31:20.069 --> 31:21.275
You OK? I

31:22.460 --> 31:25.834
Yeah, I'm OK. So, when do
I get to see you again?

31:25.939 --> 31:28.525
I don't know. How about tonight?

31:28.630 --> 31:31.195
Tonight? No, I...

31:31.350 --> 31:34.115
I can't do tonight. I have a project
I have to work on.

31:34.270 --> 31:36.794
Well, how about dinner beforehand?
I promise you'll still

31:36.939 --> 31:39.195
have time to work. I just
can't wait to see you again.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.555
Yeah, yeah. OK.

31:41.580 --> 31:42.794
OK? I can do that.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.995
I'll see you tonight. See you later.

31:58.140 --> 31:59.555
(KNOCKING)

32:04.660 --> 32:06.395
I know, I know. I'm sorry. I know.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.914
I kind of...

32:08.020 --> 32:09.275
...went out with Cole again.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.275
You what? I know, and I'm the worst.

32:12.460 --> 32:15.355
You've been sitting here waiting. That's
why I brought you back dessert.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.115
What is it?

32:19.460 --> 32:20.505
Seven layer cake.

32:24.170 --> 32:25.170
Oh, you're lucky.

32:30.140 --> 32:31.245
Get the forks.

32:36.420 --> 32:37.605
You got anything?

32:43.350 --> 32:44.350
You?

32:49.460 --> 32:50.700
I don't see how that's helpful.

32:50.780 --> 32:53.195
Well, hey, it's a
super intricate process.

32:55.780 --> 32:58.685
So, I take it the date with
what's his name went well.

32:58.780 --> 33:00.755
You know his name.

33:00.859 --> 33:02.555
And, yes, it went great.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.164
Great. Really great.

33:04.270 --> 33:05.270
Really great.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.275
And you don't find it just a little
bit strange that this

33:09.420 --> 33:12.995
seemingly perfect guy with the same
name as your fake dream boyfriend

33:13.140 --> 33:16.115
just happens to breeze into your
life and melt your heart?

33:16.220 --> 33:17.220
What are you asking?

33:17.300 --> 33:20.964
I don't know. I just... I think
it's just weird, that's all.

33:21.069 --> 33:22.475
You don't even know him.

33:22.630 --> 33:25.075
OK, fine, it is a
little coincidental.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.475
Thank you. But obviously,
that's what it is, a coincidence.

33:28.580 --> 33:29.885
What other explanation is there?

33:29.989 --> 33:31.435
OK, fine.

33:31.580 --> 33:34.714
Let's say it's a coincidence.
I guess it's possible that,

33:34.910 --> 33:37.636
at some point in your life, you'd run
into a guy named Cole. Thank you.

33:37.660 --> 33:39.180
But isn't it also
possible that you are

33:39.350 --> 33:42.430
letting that color your judgment just a
little? What is that supposed to mean?

33:42.500 --> 33:45.475
I don't know. Maybe Cole isn't the
man of your dreams.

33:45.630 --> 33:48.435
Maybe he's just some
really good looking dude.

33:48.580 --> 33:51.275
But because you've built
this image up in your mind,

33:51.420 --> 33:54.195
you're falling for the idea of the
guy that might not even be real.

33:54.350 --> 33:56.355
OK. First of all,
we've been on two dates.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.245
Second of all, they went great.

33:58.350 --> 33:59.714
You should be happy for me.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.555
Why are we even talking about this?

34:06.220 --> 34:08.635
I just don't want to see you set
yourself up to get hurt, OK?

34:08.780 --> 34:10.260
I've seen you in
this position before.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.074
This is different, Nick.

34:12.219 --> 34:15.164
It feels right and I want
to see where it goes.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.755
And as my best friend,

34:16.909 --> 34:19.914
you are bound by blood and
friendship bracelets to support me,

34:20.059 --> 34:22.525
no matter what.
Even if I'm making a mistake.

34:25.139 --> 34:26.435
OK. Fine.

34:26.550 --> 34:27.550
I'm sorry. I'm just...

34:29.139 --> 34:30.145
...frustrated, I guess.

34:31.580 --> 34:32.685
Of course you are.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.164
We've been at this for
hours and gotten nowhere.

34:47.989 --> 34:50.275
Look, I'm glad you had a nice date.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.164
Thank you. I'm sure it was magical.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.525
It was.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.325
You know you have to send me a
picture of that doodle by the way?

34:58.420 --> 34:59.420
Oh, yeah, sending now.

35:02.189 --> 35:04.435
Ahh... Woops.

35:05.780 --> 35:06.914
Woops?

35:09.220 --> 35:12.035
Yeah, I thought I was replying to
an e-mail thread with just the two of us,

35:12.059 --> 35:15.034
but I may have sent it to
Amanda by mistake.

35:16.660 --> 35:20.555
So what you're saying is, instead of sending a
list of story ideas for tomorrow's meeting...

35:21.809 --> 35:24.195
...you sent my boss a doodle of me
calling a man a stallion?

35:24.300 --> 35:25.395
No!

35:26.580 --> 35:28.275
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

35:28.380 --> 35:30.635
Nick! I'm sure it's fine.

35:30.739 --> 35:31.885
OK? You know Amanda.

35:31.989 --> 35:36.258
She'll probably love it.

35:37.853 --> 35:40.227
OK. So, what exactly
is perfect about it?

35:40.382 --> 35:44.748
Young love, a carriage ride,
a stable in downtown St Paul.

35:44.773 --> 35:47.588
I mean, that is your
story idea, right?

35:47.693 --> 35:50.227
Exploring the traditional, fun,

35:50.413 --> 35:53.538
romantic things young couples can do
in the Twin Cities at Christmas time.

35:55.893 --> 35:59.027
I mean, obviously,
that's what we were going for.

35:59.132 --> 36:00.357
Was it?

36:02.023 --> 36:04.227
You two. You are too much.

36:04.382 --> 36:06.718
I knew I was right
about this pairing.

36:06.743 --> 36:10.227
OK, wait. So, the idea is that Sarah
and her new boyfriend go on

36:10.413 --> 36:14.868
romantic escapades around the city and
I just tag along to illustrate them?

36:15.023 --> 36:19.897
Yeah. That's what we were
talking about, right, Nick?

36:21.132 --> 36:23.078
Nick, I know what you're thinking.

36:23.203 --> 36:25.227
"Doesn't that make me
the third wheel?"

36:25.382 --> 36:28.027
How's this for a thought?
Take Isabel with you.

36:28.172 --> 36:30.588
That way Nick can be
the fourth wheel.

36:30.743 --> 36:32.588
Four wheels are great. It's
a whole car.

36:32.693 --> 36:35.078
It's a whole car, Nick.

36:35.172 --> 36:37.147
Yeah. I think that's a...

36:37.283 --> 36:39.308
Sounds like a great idea.
It'd be a good story.

36:39.453 --> 36:42.588
OK, so, romantic carriage rides
is taken care of.

36:42.693 --> 36:44.027
What's next?

37:04.023 --> 37:06.428
It's beautiful out here. I can't
believe you grew up here

37:06.613 --> 37:09.828
and you've never skated the ponds. You
must not have gotten out much, huh?

37:09.922 --> 37:11.828
No, I wouldn't say that.

37:11.973 --> 37:14.308
I just didn't spend much of my time
here, you know.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.748
But I'm glad I get to spend
it with you now.

37:16.893 --> 37:19.588
Sarah and I used to come here
every Christmas growing up.

37:19.743 --> 37:24.277
Oh, yeah? Yeah, and somehow, we're
still terrible skaters.

37:24.382 --> 37:26.308
Yeah, speak for yourself.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.388
Oh, OK, is that how it is?

37:30.613 --> 37:33.668
Here. You should wear this.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.147
Oh, thank you.

37:35.283 --> 37:37.588
You stay warm. Left mine at
Nick's, I think.

37:37.613 --> 37:39.828
You should give that back to her.

37:40.023 --> 37:43.178
Aren't you cold? You're not even
wearing a coat. No, not at all. No.

37:43.283 --> 37:44.357
I was born in the snow.

37:46.563 --> 37:47.788
OK. Come on.

37:50.132 --> 37:51.748
Watch your step, dear.

37:51.853 --> 37:52.853
Slippery

37:55.023 --> 37:56.107
Aren't they cute?

37:56.203 --> 37:57.428
Adorable.

38:10.693 --> 38:13.178
So, where's the most amazing place
you've ever skated?

38:15.023 --> 38:16.357
Oh, that's a tough question.

38:18.813 --> 38:21.027
Zermatt in Switzerland is
incredible.

38:21.172 --> 38:23.538
Don't even get me started on the
Red Square in Moscow.

38:23.693 --> 38:26.588
We won't. But the best place,
honestly?

38:26.743 --> 38:29.718
Oh, man, the best place is this lake
that I literally stumbled upon.

38:29.843 --> 38:31.588
It's 5,000 feet up in
the Canadian Rockies.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.027
It is only accessible by
a helicopter.

38:34.132 --> 38:35.818
And the views are breathtaking.

38:37.172 --> 38:38.638
Sounds amazing.

38:38.743 --> 38:39.897
And convenient.

38:41.533 --> 38:44.718
Maybe I'll take you sometime.
That would be fun.

38:46.413 --> 38:47.413
You ready? I

38:48.693 --> 38:50.588
Yeah. You guys coming?

38:52.743 --> 38:56.868
Oh, no. You know, I'm going to get a
jump start on all this wintry splendour.

38:56.973 --> 38:58.718
In a bit.

38:58.843 --> 39:01.227
Yeah, you... You guys go ahead.
I'll keep him company.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.868
OK. See you out there.

39:05.333 --> 39:06.748
All right.

39:11.132 --> 39:12.227
You're a natural.

39:16.533 --> 39:18.868
Thanks for letting
Nick and Isabel tag along.

39:18.973 --> 39:20.468
I know you wanted a date.

39:20.563 --> 39:22.027
It's for work, I totally understand.

39:22.172 --> 39:24.428
Not just for work.
Isabel's my friend

39:24.563 --> 39:27.718
and Nick's one of my
favourite people in the world.

39:28.973 --> 39:30.893
Oh, hey, just as long as I get
to skate with you.

39:37.773 --> 39:39.538
That Cole's really something, huh?

39:41.052 --> 39:42.868
Yeah, he's something all right.

39:45.203 --> 39:47.868
So, how long you been in
love with her?

39:50.533 --> 39:52.708
Oh, yeah, don't deny it.
Yeah, it's real obvious.

39:59.413 --> 40:02.588
Well, I met her in the first grade,
so pretty much my whole life.

40:04.893 --> 40:05.893
Does she know?

40:07.203 --> 40:08.203
I don't know.

40:09.922 --> 40:12.147
I tried telling her a few
times over the years,

40:12.333 --> 40:15.748
but she's either always had a boyfriend
or just fantasizing about some

40:15.913 --> 40:18.247
dream guy. That doesn't really
inspire a lot of confidence.

40:19.863 --> 40:21.247
Yeah. I get that. I

40:22.683 --> 40:25.167
We did date for a week in
high school though.

40:25.272 --> 40:26.408
That was until the...

40:26.503 --> 40:28.297
Oh! The Christmas pageant?

40:29.753 --> 40:32.558
You know about that? Oh, yeah, man.
Everybody knows about that.

40:33.863 --> 40:38.127
I mean, it has all the components of,
like, the most classic break-up, right?

40:38.272 --> 40:41.247
It's got a public setting,
epic misunderstandings,

40:41.353 --> 40:42.658
hilarious pratfalls.

40:42.753 --> 40:43.838
Yeah, OK, that's great.

40:43.942 --> 40:44.942
This is...

40:45.043 --> 40:48.728
I heard., I heard that the gym in
the school still has, like,

40:48.863 --> 40:51.838
a huge dent from the impact
when you fell off the stage.

40:54.402 --> 40:56.047
Ironically, it's heart-shaped.

40:59.113 --> 41:03.198
You know, I know I should give
up on it, but I just can't.

41:05.272 --> 41:07.167
Even when it's clear what
she really wants.

41:12.633 --> 41:14.768
You know what always
makes me feel better?

41:14.793 --> 41:17.127
Fresh elk jerky.

41:17.223 --> 41:19.528
No, I'm serious.

41:19.553 --> 41:21.688
Have some. I have so much,
it's not even funny.

41:21.793 --> 41:22.838
Come on.

41:25.192 --> 41:26.192
Home-made.

41:29.633 --> 41:30.633
Right? I

41:45.043 --> 41:48.768
My lady. Wow. Such a gentleman.

41:48.863 --> 41:50.768
Thank you. Watch your step here.

41:50.863 --> 41:52.838
Thanks for driving, Isobel.

41:54.192 --> 41:55.192
Thanks.

41:56.793 --> 41:58.558
I can take these. Oh.

41:59.993 --> 42:02.353
I always wondered what this place
looked like on the inside.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.768
What do you mean?

42:05.963 --> 42:09.088
Oh, I hung out in the neighborhood a
lot, but I've always loved this house.

42:10.353 --> 42:11.353
Really?

42:11.392 --> 42:13.367
I wonder if we ever played together
as kids.

42:18.043 --> 42:19.328
I'm sure we did.

42:23.142 --> 42:24.658
Hey! You're home!

42:24.753 --> 42:25.753
Dad!

42:27.833 --> 42:31.728
You must be this Cole that
Sarah's been talking about.

42:31.833 --> 42:33.768
I'm Alan. Nice to meet you.

42:33.863 --> 42:35.167
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

42:38.353 --> 42:41.968
Well, thank you for today.
Yeah. Should probably get going.

42:42.113 --> 42:45.018
OK. Don't forget about our plans
for tomorrow.

42:45.142 --> 42:48.297
Oh, never. As soon as the sun comes
up, I'll be right here.

42:48.392 --> 42:49.808
OK. I'll make coffee.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.198
Bye.

43:02.223 --> 43:03.888
What? A whole year?

43:04.033 --> 43:06.528
In Europe? Yeah. Isn't that
the best story?

43:06.633 --> 43:08.198
Man, I wish I could do that.

43:09.473 --> 43:11.808
Look, I know that your whole life
here, but...

43:11.942 --> 43:14.297
You know it's not
going anywhere, right?

43:14.322 --> 43:17.888
All I'm saying is, I don't want you
to wait to fulfill your dreams.

43:18.033 --> 43:21.528
You know, if you wait in one spot
too long, you can get stuck.

43:21.633 --> 43:22.808
Trust me. I

43:24.633 --> 43:27.008
Hey, I didn't know that you
and your dad sold furniture.

43:27.142 --> 43:28.917
Yeah. Well, my dad does
most of the work.

43:29.072 --> 43:32.088
My mom used to help him so I just
pitch in where I can.

43:32.223 --> 43:34.558
The only reason he still does
it is to feel closer to her.

43:36.392 --> 43:40.117
I think he's ready to retire, but I
don't know what I'll do when he does.

43:40.272 --> 43:43.408
The house is technically
mine now, which is great.

43:43.503 --> 43:44.503
Um...

43:46.192 --> 43:49.167
But it just feels
like this big anchor.

43:52.783 --> 43:54.367
Have you ever thought of selling?

43:57.553 --> 43:59.117
I don't know if I could
ever do that.

44:00.553 --> 44:02.278
It's the only home I've ever had.

44:03.863 --> 44:04.917
I understand.

44:06.322 --> 44:09.198
But a ship can't set sail
until it raises anchor.

44:17.272 --> 44:18.912
It's too bad it isn't January.
In a month,

44:18.942 --> 44:21.758
this place is going to be crammed
with people for the winter carnival.

44:21.863 --> 44:23.888
Winter carnival? What's that?

44:24.033 --> 44:27.088
What, you grew up here and you don't
know what the winter carnival is?

44:27.192 --> 44:28.748
No, I'm usually gone by Christmas.

44:28.933 --> 44:34.047
It's this amazing outdoor fair with ice
sculpting and food trucks and music.

44:34.192 --> 44:36.117
It's one of my favourite things
about this city.

44:36.272 --> 44:38.688
Plus, there's like deep-fried
everything.

44:38.783 --> 44:40.247
Like, it's magical.

44:40.392 --> 44:43.398
Do you remember when we were eight
and Katie Wudeckis threw up that

44:43.553 --> 44:45.888
deep-fried Twinkie all over
the ice palace?

44:46.033 --> 44:48.758
I forgot about that. And then Ryan
Schneider slipped and fell in it.

44:48.863 --> 44:50.167
Yeah.

44:50.322 --> 44:54.198
Hey, we've been going to this thing
for, like, 20 years now together.

44:54.353 --> 44:56.917
We have. That's a lot
of good memories.

44:57.033 --> 45:00.558
Yeah. Yeah, a lot of good memories.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.398
So, what's on the agenda?

45:04.553 --> 45:06.558
Only one of the best free activities
available

45:06.713 --> 45:08.728
to everyone in the
Twin Cities during winter.

45:10.473 --> 45:11.808
BOTH: Snow sculpting.

45:13.142 --> 45:14.142
No way. I

45:21.553 --> 45:24.988
I'm so excited right now. Yeah, we're
just basically building snowmen.

45:25.092 --> 45:27.028
Yeah, I love snowmen.

45:27.162 --> 45:29.367
Hey, dibs on that pile right there.
OK?

45:34.072 --> 45:36.247
Oh. OK.

45:36.392 --> 45:39.167
Hey, what do you say we team up and
show Cole how this is done?

45:39.353 --> 45:42.297
This is incredible. Sarah, you've got
to come check this out. Come here!

45:42.423 --> 45:44.448
I'd better go over there
before he hurts himself.

45:44.583 --> 45:46.143
I'm not going to
hurt myself. Come here.

45:47.583 --> 45:48.938
Yeah, that would be terrible.

45:49.993 --> 45:50.993
Real bad.

45:52.493 --> 45:54.267
All right. Here, you take this.

45:54.373 --> 45:55.668
We're going to make a big pile.

45:55.803 --> 45:57.808
Like this big. OK?
OK. Come on. Yeah.

45:57.913 --> 45:59.578
Pile there. Stack it up.

46:01.783 --> 46:03.247
Hey, why don't I be your co-pilot?

46:04.583 --> 46:06.328
No, what's the point?

46:06.473 --> 46:10.047
Well, I mean, you could
beat Cole at something

46:10.192 --> 46:12.528
and rub it in his big,
beautiful face?

46:12.633 --> 46:14.478
You're an artist and...

46:14.583 --> 46:16.608
This is clearly his first time.

46:18.223 --> 46:20.167
What do you say?

46:20.272 --> 46:21.472
Oh, they don't stand a chance.

46:24.223 --> 46:25.398
Oh, yeah.

46:34.312 --> 46:36.198
And you've never done this before?

46:36.312 --> 46:37.758
No. Never. I

46:37.863 --> 46:38.863
I just get snow.

46:42.942 --> 46:44.398
Do you guys see this?

46:45.553 --> 46:46.888
I mean...

46:46.993 --> 46:49.498
I mean, it's good. Yeah.

46:49.603 --> 46:51.838
But, you know, get a load of ours!

46:56.993 --> 46:59.167
Yeah. Yeah.

46:59.192 --> 47:01.758
I like that you've got this
slug thing going on.

47:01.863 --> 47:04.528
No, no. Come on, it's a shark.

47:04.633 --> 47:06.037
Obviously. Like, come on.

47:06.142 --> 47:08.938
See? You get it?

47:09.033 --> 47:11.608
It's got a little Santa hat.

47:11.713 --> 47:15.167
See? Yeah, Santa jaws, right?

47:15.272 --> 47:16.828
Oh! Yeah.

47:16.933 --> 47:19.267
Yeah, no, I see it. It's great.

47:19.443 --> 47:22.399
I've got to be honest, I don't see it,
but hey, I love the effort, little guy.

47:22.423 --> 47:25.558
Come around here,
let's get a picture.

47:25.713 --> 47:29.117
Oh, yeah. Great idea.
We're going to get one...

47:29.223 --> 47:30.917
Come on.

47:32.863 --> 47:35.167
Oh. Ice cream store.

47:35.312 --> 47:37.247
You want ice cream?
It's 15 degrees outside.

47:37.353 --> 47:38.888
I love 15 degrees. I love ice cream.

47:38.993 --> 47:40.528
I love winter.

47:40.633 --> 47:42.008
Yeah? OK. Jump on the sled.

47:42.113 --> 47:43.113
We'll go. I

47:43.142 --> 47:44.367
Shark.

47:51.553 --> 47:54.528
OK, so, if we start
with ice skating,

47:54.673 --> 47:57.928
what about a full page
next to it with this?

47:59.783 --> 48:01.678
That's amazing!

48:01.783 --> 48:03.968
I love how you captured the moment.

48:04.062 --> 48:05.838
That's really wonderful.

48:05.953 --> 48:07.608
Yeah, we have to use that.

48:07.703 --> 48:09.728
Yeah. Thanks.

48:09.863 --> 48:13.218
We should also think about
a picture for the front page.

48:13.412 --> 48:16.248
She hasn't asked yet, but knowing
Amanda, she's going to want, you know,

48:16.272 --> 48:19.608
this perfect image that
encapsulates the future story.

48:19.703 --> 48:21.678
Yeah. Any ideas?

48:21.833 --> 48:25.367
I... I can mock up a
few drawings here.

48:25.503 --> 48:29.037
It would have to be something
meaningful, something important.

48:29.142 --> 48:30.328
Yeah.

48:32.863 --> 48:34.808
Hey, what about, um...

48:37.473 --> 48:40.398
What about something
like this? Cole?

48:40.503 --> 48:42.928
Hi. Hi, what are you doing here?

48:43.062 --> 48:44.502
I'm sorry. I don't want to
interrupt.

48:44.633 --> 48:46.928
I just thought that maybe you could
use some brain fuel.

48:46.953 --> 48:48.608
That's so thoughtful.

48:48.753 --> 48:51.917
Thank you. I hope you like
traditional Nordic cuisine.

48:53.223 --> 48:55.287
I found this great
Norwegian restaurant.

48:57.312 --> 49:00.416
And, apparently, they have the best
lutefisk in town.

49:01.601 --> 49:04.526
Lutefisk? Yeah.
It's what people eat.

49:04.671 --> 49:06.896
I mean, the locals, you know.
It's fish.

49:08.441 --> 49:09.616
Oh, yeah. I

49:10.801 --> 49:13.005
Yeah, no, I'm pretty
sure that's pudding.

49:13.160 --> 49:17.005
Ha! You're funny! I've got
another fork. There you go.

49:17.110 --> 49:19.446
Ladies first. Here you are.

49:19.601 --> 49:21.616
And don't think I forgot
about you, little guy.

49:21.721 --> 49:22.896
Oh, great. Yeah.

49:23.030 --> 49:27.296
That's... Eat up.
Yeah, eat up, Sarah.

49:28.601 --> 49:29.601
Yeah. OK.

49:29.721 --> 49:33.255
Yeah. You know what? I like trying
new things so this is...

49:37.751 --> 49:39.286
Mm!

49:39.391 --> 49:41.056
I knew she'd like it.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.135
(SHE COUGHS)

49:43.240 --> 49:44.286
You OK? I

49:44.441 --> 49:47.056
I'm just not really used
to the consistency.

49:47.191 --> 49:49.056
I'm sorry. I totally should have
asked you

49:49.191 --> 49:51.526
what your favourite
take-out was. BOTH: Burritos.

49:53.641 --> 49:56.696
Sorry. I think the lutefisk is about
to swim to the surface.

49:56.801 --> 49:59.335
Swim? What? No, Sarah?

50:01.030 --> 50:03.166
What? What happened? What did I do?

50:09.721 --> 50:11.166
Hey, is she OK?

50:11.311 --> 50:15.646
Well, she's in bed with a bucket
beside her, so she's been better,

50:15.671 --> 50:17.416
but nothing to worry about.

50:17.521 --> 50:19.215
It's Katie Wudeckis all over again.

50:19.311 --> 50:20.576
(LAUGHTER)

50:20.671 --> 50:22.646
It's my fault. Relax, dude.

50:22.801 --> 50:25.085
She ate some bad fish.
It's not the end of the world.

50:25.110 --> 50:26.646
I want to make her feel better.

50:26.801 --> 50:29.536
I don't want her to Katie
Wudeckis into a bucket.

50:29.671 --> 50:32.696
OK, well, I'm going to leave you
guys to it.

50:32.831 --> 50:34.311
I'm going to go back and
check on her.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.056
Thanks, Alan. Yeah, thank you, sir.

50:44.471 --> 50:45.976
Can I ask you a serious question?

50:47.441 --> 50:49.286
Yeah. What brought you here?

50:50.801 --> 50:52.726
See, Sarah thinks it's

50:52.881 --> 50:55.696
fate or a Christmas miracle or
something, I don't know.

50:55.831 --> 51:00.646
I just, I don't buy it.
You don't believe in fate?

51:00.751 --> 51:01.936
Only when it feels right.

51:03.441 --> 51:04.896
Did you plan all this?

51:06.471 --> 51:09.416
Did you look her up online, learn some
things about her to win her over?

51:10.671 --> 51:12.366
I just showed up.

51:13.921 --> 51:15.496
Look, Nick, I know what
this is about.

51:15.601 --> 51:16.856
Your Sarah's best friend.

51:18.110 --> 51:20.750
You want to make sure that she ends
up with a good guy. I get that.

51:23.881 --> 51:25.005
I promise you...

51:26.601 --> 51:29.255
...making sure that Sarah's happy is
the only thing I care about.

51:30.831 --> 51:33.496
You know that she made a wish to
fall in love by Christmas?

51:34.921 --> 51:36.041
How did you know about that?

51:37.240 --> 51:38.776
She told me.

51:38.921 --> 51:42.005
I don't want there to be any
bad blood between us, OK?

51:42.110 --> 51:44.446
So if you need to ask me anything,

51:44.601 --> 51:47.856
to make sure that my intentions
are true with Sarah, ask.

51:49.831 --> 51:51.005
OK, little guy?

51:55.160 --> 51:56.926
OK, so where did you go to college?

51:57.081 --> 52:00.856
I didn't. I've been travelling for
as long as I can remember.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.151
Yeah, I got a better education

52:02.240 --> 52:04.286
living in igloos than I would have
in the classroom.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.335
Yeah, OK, that's great,

52:07.471 --> 52:11.286
but what's the name of the adventure
tourism company that you work for?

52:11.391 --> 52:13.646
Adventure Tourism Company.

52:13.831 --> 52:18.286
I don't know. I mean, it's kind of
weird not having a permanent address, right?

52:18.471 --> 52:21.696
I never stay put long enough to have
one. I don't see what the big deal is.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.416
So, you don't know where they are?

52:27.561 --> 52:29.135
No, never really met my parents.

52:30.441 --> 52:33.176
Oh. That must have been really hard.

52:36.160 --> 52:38.255
How are you doing over there, little
guy?

52:38.441 --> 52:42.856
So, what about this year? Are you planning
on sticking around for Christmas?

52:44.360 --> 52:48.536
You know what, I mean, I have some deadlines
at work, but just depends where I'm at with those.

52:48.561 --> 52:50.726
Are you warm? Ls it warm out here?

52:50.831 --> 52:52.446
Finding it really warm.

52:52.561 --> 52:53.976
I've got to cool down.

53:02.671 --> 53:03.696
Wow.

53:18.201 --> 53:19.646
OK.

53:19.751 --> 53:21.926
It's done. Like, all of it?

53:23.240 --> 53:24.240
Take a look.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.806
I'm still tinkering with the title,
but other than that,

53:29.921 --> 53:31.806
it's ready to send to Amanda.

53:35.280 --> 53:37.416
Do you hate it?

53:37.441 --> 53:39.926
No. No, no, I like it.

53:41.311 --> 53:43.085
It's very accurate.

53:43.191 --> 53:44.416
Yeah?

53:45.671 --> 53:46.896
That means a lot to me.

53:51.521 --> 53:52.776
(MOBILE VIBRATES)

53:55.030 --> 53:56.926
It's... Cole.

53:57.081 --> 53:59.536
He is asking when I'll be
back at the house.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.255
He has a surprise for me.

54:06.441 --> 54:09.005
Come on, then. Better get you back.

54:12.941 --> 54:14.036
Hey.

54:15.610 --> 54:16.916
Hey-HEY-

54:17.011 --> 54:18.011
Hi.

54:19.331 --> 54:21.396
Are you ready for
your surprise? Yeah.

54:26.730 --> 54:28.786
Dean Papadopoulos?

54:28.891 --> 54:29.891
Hey, Sarah.

54:31.251 --> 54:32.316
Wait, is this your house?

54:32.421 --> 54:33.421
What are you doing here?

54:35.061 --> 54:36.061
I asked him to come.

54:36.141 --> 54:38.585
You were right, Cole.
This place is sick.

54:38.701 --> 54:40.316
That's a real estate term.

54:41.701 --> 54:43.276
What is he talking about?

54:43.421 --> 54:45.705
You know what? I think you will be
pleasantly surprised.

54:45.730 --> 54:47.676
You listed the house?

54:47.860 --> 54:51.316
No, of course not. I informally pitched
the idea around town, that's all.

54:51.421 --> 54:53.196
Why? That is none of your business.

54:53.331 --> 54:55.131
I know, I just thought it would be a
good idea

54:55.301 --> 54:58.476
to talk through all the options. Talk?
You want to talk to Dean Papadopoulos?

54:58.610 --> 55:01.196
Nothing is officially
listed. Nothing is happening. Sarah?

55:03.221 --> 55:05.346
I did this for you.
How is this for me?

55:05.371 --> 55:07.226
You said this place was an anchor.

55:07.371 --> 55:09.171
OK, perhaps it's too big for you and
your dad.

55:09.221 --> 55:11.426
OK, you also said that your dad
wanted to retire, right?

55:11.610 --> 55:16.316
(DISTANT): So what! That doesn't give you the
right to intervene. Cole, we just started dating.

55:16.421 --> 55:18.146
Is this their first fight?

55:18.301 --> 55:22.226
Yeah. I guess Sarah's
dream man's human after all.

55:22.341 --> 55:25.226
Try not to act so cavalier.

55:25.341 --> 55:27.036
My daughter's upset.

55:27.141 --> 55:28.705
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

55:30.780 --> 55:32.146
Nick... l

55:33.451 --> 55:37.585
You know I have always rooted for
you, ever since you and Sarah were kids.

55:37.701 --> 55:40.116
I've never mentioned it to Sarah.

55:40.251 --> 55:42.676
You know how she is. She wants
to do things her own way.

55:42.811 --> 55:46.585
Oh, yeah. But you can't
just wait around.

55:46.730 --> 55:49.786
How many more snowmen are you
planning on building?

55:52.171 --> 55:54.755
I'm sorry. I should
have talked to you first.

55:54.941 --> 55:57.786
Sometimes I just feel like my head
is full of snow, but honestly...

55:59.860 --> 56:01.196
...l just want you to be happy.

56:02.941 --> 56:05.585
Cole... You know what?

56:05.730 --> 56:07.946
I have something that might help you
make up your mind.

56:13.371 --> 56:16.755
I know, Christmas, it's a few clays
off still, but I just couldn't wait.

56:18.251 --> 56:20.066
What is this?

56:20.171 --> 56:22.036
I'm leaving Christmas Eve.

56:22.141 --> 56:23.266
You're leaving?

56:24.860 --> 56:27.146
Boss says he wants me back on the
road.

56:27.171 --> 56:28.786
What about us?

56:28.891 --> 56:30.146
Open it.

56:38.780 --> 56:41.196
A plane ticket. I want you to come
to Paris with me.

56:43.530 --> 56:44.786
To Paris?

56:46.011 --> 56:47.196
I can't fly to Paris.

56:47.341 --> 56:49.396
Why not? It's Christmas. You could
take a week off,

56:49.530 --> 56:51.835
or more if you want
to stay longer. Stay longer? Yeah.

56:51.860 --> 56:52.866
I can't stay longer.

56:52.980 --> 56:54.916
Why not? I have a job.

56:55.011 --> 56:56.116
The house.

56:56.221 --> 56:57.705
My dad. Quit your job.

56:57.860 --> 56:59.540
You already know you could
sell this place.

56:59.650 --> 57:02.010
Your dad could come with us, if
you want. Quit my job? Yeah.

57:02.061 --> 57:05.266
I can't just drop everything to go
to Paris with you.

57:05.371 --> 57:06.625
OK.

57:08.371 --> 57:09.531
OK. Yeah, I'm going to do it.

57:10.811 --> 57:12.211
I'm going to tell Sarah how I feel.

57:12.291 --> 57:14.866
Right now? Yeah. Right
here, right now.

57:15.011 --> 57:16.866
If there's a chance that
I'm going to lose her,

57:17.011 --> 57:18.755
then I'm not going to
wait another second.

57:21.061 --> 57:23.946
I just want you to come to Paris
with me and spend the holidays.

57:24.061 --> 57:25.705
All this other stuff can wait.

57:27.221 --> 57:30.585
Who knows, maybe we'll have
an amazing Christmas.

57:30.730 --> 57:32.946
Might even be the
Christmas you deserve.

57:34.421 --> 57:37.316
Might even have a little adventure.

57:37.451 --> 57:39.196
Isn't that something
you've always wanted?

57:40.780 --> 57:42.116
Yeah.

57:43.891 --> 57:46.786
Let's adventure then. OK.

57:46.891 --> 57:49.146
OK? Yeah.

57:49.171 --> 57:50.316
Let's go.

57:59.780 --> 58:02.266
Nick! You'll never
guess what happened.

58:02.421 --> 58:04.426
Cole and I are
spending Christmas in Paris.

58:09.091 --> 58:10.091
Nick?

58:17.451 --> 58:18.451
Hey!

58:20.171 --> 58:21.986
Nick, what's going on?

58:23.371 --> 58:24.705
You're going to Paris with him?

58:24.860 --> 58:27.220
We're going for a week.
What's the big deal? Look, I just...

58:27.251 --> 58:30.116
I know that if you leave, it
will probably be too late.

58:30.251 --> 58:33.476
What are you talking about?
I can't keep doing this.

58:33.581 --> 58:36.346
Doing what? Waiting.

58:36.501 --> 58:39.316
Watching you fall in and out of love
and then having to help you

58:39.451 --> 58:41.866
pick up the pieces when the illusion
gets shattered.

58:43.530 --> 58:46.986
OK. I'm taking myself off the article, I'm
calling Amanda tonight. Nick, don't do that.

58:47.141 --> 58:49.196
I can't keep drawing
you two together.

58:52.291 --> 58:53.786
OK? It's too hard.

58:55.341 --> 58:57.116
I'm happy for you. I really am.

58:58.860 --> 59:01.066
I just can't keep pretending
that it's making me happy.

59:05.650 --> 59:07.426
Have fun in Europe.
Send me a postcard.

01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:08.366
OK. This isn't healthy.

01:00:14.161 --> 01:00:16.616
You've got a good view.

01:00:16.721 --> 01:00:18.056
Take that in.

01:00:18.161 --> 01:00:19.566
OK? You know what?

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.056
Here. You take this. You stay warm.

01:00:25.111 --> 01:00:27.006
Nick, don't do anything stupid.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.806
Let me see. Yeah, you're looking
good.

01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:32.605
Looking good, Hank.

01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:33.975
OK.

01:00:36.271 --> 01:00:37.525
Looking good.

01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:41.645
Nick. We need to talk.

01:00:41.831 --> 01:00:46.525
Yeah, sure thing. What's... What's on your mind,
little guy? Enough with the little guy, OK?

01:00:48.161 --> 01:00:49.696
I don't like you.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.136
Oh. And I don't believe that you
just happened to be named Cole or that

01:00:53.311 --> 01:00:56.645
you coincidentally have every quality
that Sarah's looking for in a man.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.775
Or how you knew exactly what buttons
to press

01:00:58.911 --> 01:01:01.166
to get her to fall in love
with you. I like buttons.

01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:04.566
Look, I know I should be happy for her
and I know I should have backed off,

01:01:04.721 --> 01:01:06.566
but I just can't let her
fly out of my life

01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:09.006
without knowing
exactly what you're after.

01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:11.136
I want her to find true love, Nick.

01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:14.446
And I think if she comes to Paris
with me, shall have that,

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:15.550
just like her parents.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:18.336
So, what, you're going to trick her
into falling in love with you?

01:01:18.471 --> 01:01:20.496
No. I'm helping her find what she's
always wanted

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.855
and if she doesn't fall in love by
Christmas, then...

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.616
I don't know what's going to happen.

01:01:26.721 --> 01:01:27.855
I do.

01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:32.441
She's going to come to her senses and she's
going to find love with the right person.

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:35.006
I can't take that chance, Nick.

01:01:36.361 --> 01:01:39.975
So why don't you just step aside and let
Sarah have the life she's always wanted?

01:01:40.081 --> 01:01:41.855
OK, little guy?

01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:45.206
Oh, my... With the little guy!

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:49.366
Hey! Hey! You leave Hank out of
this, all right?

01:01:49.521 --> 01:01:52.525
You don't like when I meddle with
your snowman? No. No? I don't.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.975
Whoa, seriously. I said
don't touch that.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.366
Don't touch... Seriously!

01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:58.725
Seriously! You know what?

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.806
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:02:00.911 --> 01:02:04.086
No! Hank! Buddy!

01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.086
Hang in there, man!

01:02:06.191 --> 01:02:09.725
Keep the pressure on. We're good.

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:12.496
Keep the pressure on.
Keep the pressure on.

01:02:19.271 --> 01:02:20.645
Murderer!

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:25.886
What is wrong with you?

01:02:44.711 --> 01:02:47.356
Slug. It's a shark. It's clearly not
a shark.

01:02:47.511 --> 01:02:49.276
Have you ever seen a shark before?
Amateur!

01:02:49.431 --> 01:02:51.236
(WHISTLE)
Stop!

01:02:54.381 --> 01:02:57.715
Hank had nothing to do with it. Yeah, we
were having a talk, but you know, he...

01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.585
He's never been in a fight ever
before.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.996
I promise. He's really not an
aggressive person.

01:03:02.151 --> 01:03:03.835
This is really out of
character for him.

01:03:03.941 --> 01:03:04.941
I...

01:03:06.461 --> 01:03:08.076
I'm going to go talk to him.

01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:20.835
So?

01:03:21.021 --> 01:03:24.876
Care to explain why my best friend and
my boyfriend were fighting in a park?

01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:27.326
Well, technically, it was
a snowball fight.

01:03:27.351 --> 01:03:29.276
It's completely... different.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.436
OK.

01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:36.196
Look, I don't know what happened,
OK? We were talking about you

01:03:36.351 --> 01:03:38.556
and then he started talking about
the trip and...

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.436
...l just lost it.

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.715
Nick, you have to let this go.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.196
I can't. OK? He's not right for you,
Sarah.

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:47.765
Don't let him trick you into
going to Paris with him.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.126
Trick me? Yes.

01:03:50.151 --> 01:03:52.196
Wow. You are unbelievable.

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:55.156
Sarah, I...

01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:02.156
Sarah!

01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:12.076
Sarah, wait.

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.835
Why are you doing this?

01:04:13.941 --> 01:04:14.996
Come on, you know why.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.606
No, I don't, so explain it to me.

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:20.076
Why are you trying to ruin my
relationship with Cole?

01:04:20.101 --> 01:04:22.341
Because I've been in love with you
since the fifth grade.

01:04:23.901 --> 01:04:25.781
Ever since we built that first
snowman together.

01:04:27.581 --> 01:04:30.356
It was a crush at first,
but after that, I knew.

01:04:30.461 --> 01:04:32.635
Nick... Sarah, I've always known.

01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:36.076
OK? And I think, deep down, you've
always known too.

01:04:37.251 --> 01:04:39.126
We grew up together.

01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:42.516
If you really felt this way, don't you think
you would have said something before?

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.715
Believe me, I've tried.

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:46.126
I have.

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:50.916
But you've been so obsessed with finding
this crazy, unrealistic version of...

01:04:51.071 --> 01:04:53.715
It's not crazy, OK? I have
that with Cole. That's not real.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.196
It's a fantasy.
You're not thinking straight

01:04:56.221 --> 01:04:59.356
because he promised to whisk you
away on some romantic adventure.

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:05.196
OK? And What happens when the
vacation's over, Sarah?

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:09.411
What, you're going to live happily
ever after with him?

01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:11.076
I don't know. I do.

01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:14.406
When the adrenaline wears off, you're
going to be disappointed. Once again.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.476
It's because you're terrified to
accept anything else than

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:18.965
what you've been waiting for.

01:05:19.101 --> 01:05:20.835
You don't know what you're talking
about.

01:05:20.941 --> 01:05:22.436
Yes, I do.

01:05:23.941 --> 01:05:25.156
See, you think it's giving up.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:27.540
You think it's settling.

01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:30.765
But it's not, Sarah.

01:05:30.941 --> 01:05:34.996
True love's not about the butterflies
or giving up your mundane life.

01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:40.196
It's knowing somebody and being
there for them, no matter what.

01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:41.835
OK? And that's what we have.

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:43.965
So this is your idea of
being there for me?

01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:46.116
Ruining my chance at love?

01:05:46.221 --> 01:05:47.965
Oh, you're not in love with him.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:56.476
Are you in love with him?

01:06:08.221 --> 01:06:10.421
You're not the only one waiting for
a wish to come true.

01:06:13.351 --> 01:06:14.796
Because every single Christmas,

01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:17.076
I fall more in love with you.

01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:22.996
And every single Christmas,
I wish that you'd finally see it.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.196
I guess this year's no different.

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:55.996
OK if I come in?

01:06:57.181 --> 01:06:58.196
Yeah.

01:07:07.121 --> 01:07:09.436
Seems like you had quite the day.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.846
Yeah, it was...

01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:16.001
...illuminating.

01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:21.386
I had a fight with Nick.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.840
'I heard. I

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.040
I know this is none of my business.

01:07:27.161 --> 01:07:30.026
You're a grown woman. You know what
you want and I admire that.

01:07:33.121 --> 01:07:36.136
Nick's a good kid. Try not
to hold it against him.

01:07:37.831 --> 01:07:40.256
Love makes you do stupid things.

01:07:40.371 --> 01:07:42.955
He must really be in love
to do something that stupid.

01:07:43.061 --> 01:07:44.236
Maybe he is. I

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:47.986
And even if he's acting
like an idiot,

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:50.786
try to remember it's
because he cares about you.

01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:56.236
That's a rare thing, to have someone
that

01:07:56.371 --> 01:07:58.396
you know will always be there for
you.

01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:00.906
Especially when it hurts.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:08.745
I just hope Cole shows you as much
support and devotion.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.955
Two clays before Christmas
and you're still going at it.

01:08:39.571 --> 01:08:42.332
I just want to make sure Amanda has
everything before the issue posts.

01:08:42.371 --> 01:08:44.986
I don't know what she's going to do
without Nick's illustrations.

01:08:45.161 --> 01:08:48.745
Why are you still here? Oh, family's
doing some hunting over the holidays.

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:50.495
Oh, yeah. I

01:08:56.701 --> 01:08:59.136
I can get you a Christmas
goose, if you want.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:01.036
No, thanks.

01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:03.786
No, I'm more of a store-bought
kind of girl.

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:06.185
Why was that there?

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:08.745
Where do you keep your crossbow?

01:09:10.451 --> 01:09:12.386
So, tomorrow's the big day, huh?

01:09:12.571 --> 01:09:16.345
Still going? Yeah. Bags are all packed,
we leave first thing in the morning.

01:09:16.451 --> 01:09:18.676
Wow. Christmas in Paris.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:21.265
You know, I have to say,
it's not really for me,

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:24.875
like, but I'm sure it's going
to be very romantic.

01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:28.856
Yeah. I'm sure Nick's not going to
be too happy about that.

01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:31.906
No, he's not.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.100
I don't know what the big deal is.
It's just a week.

01:09:36.091 --> 01:09:37.625
Yeah, but you know,
what if it's not?

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:41.136
I mean, I'm sure he's worried you're
going to go over there and get, like,

01:09:41.291 --> 01:09:44.546
swept up in the whole whirlwind of
it all and never come back.

01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:47.136
Or, you know, come back with
a honkin' ring on your finger.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.466
Well, I should get to the cabin.

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:55.066
But you have a great time
on your trip, OK?

01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:56.975
Thanks. Merry Christmas.

01:09:57.081 --> 01:09:58.126
Aww, right back at you.

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.495
Sarah, you should probably call
Nick and say goodbye before you go.

01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:06.186
I mean, he is your best friend.

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.825
OK. Take care.

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:16.546
(KNOCKING)

01:10:16.701 --> 01:10:20.495
Sarah. Literally my favourite person
in the entire world.

01:10:20.701 --> 01:10:24.645
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure you
didn't need anything before I head out.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:26.446
Oh, you're so thoughtful.

01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:28.546
No, I think everything's set.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:29.650
Good.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:38.136
I also wanted to apologies for
Nick and the artwork.

01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:40.776
I know it's a
last-minute curve ball.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.266
It's my fault.

01:10:42.411 --> 01:10:44.346
Curveball? I thought
they were great.

01:10:46.131 --> 01:10:47.776
He gave them to you? Oh, yeah.

01:10:47.931 --> 01:10:50.596
I'm not going to lie, I was a little
worried after his phone call.

01:10:50.701 --> 01:10:52.136
But he sent them in this morning.

01:10:53.881 --> 01:10:55.495
Oh. Well, that's great.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:57.986
I just didn't get a
chance to see them.

01:10:58.161 --> 01:11:01.281
Well, then, you'd better make sure you
read the article when it posts tomorrow.

01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:02.875
You're going to love them.

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:09.596
And seriously, Sarah, the feature you
wrote for this issue, it's perfect.

01:11:11.931 --> 01:11:14.875
Now go get out of here and take
a well-deserved week off.

01:11:15.011 --> 01:11:17.986
And when you get back,
as our new head writer,

01:11:18.161 --> 01:11:21.705
we're going to have to sit down and talk about
the magazine's new travel column. Really?

01:11:23.371 --> 01:11:25.466
Amanda, thank you so much.

01:11:25.571 --> 01:11:27.875
Thank you. Now, go have some fun.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:28.980
OK.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.316
Oh, and merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:18.501
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:12:20.581 --> 01:12:23.342
Not going to lie, a part of me was
hoping that you'd change your mind.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:26.635
Oh, you didn't get more
gifts, did you?

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:29.606
No. Well, those are for Herb.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.260
Should I put them under the
tree or...?

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.426
Who's that from? Well, I...

01:12:36.581 --> 01:12:39.036
I found that on the porch this
morning.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780
On the porch?

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:47.010
Nick!

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.051
Do you really think he's
in love with me?

01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:51.505
Of course he is. I

01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:53.276
Anyone can see that.

01:12:53.421 --> 01:12:56.076
And I've seen you two together
since you were kids.

01:12:56.221 --> 01:12:57.885
Are you really going to try to
convince me

01:12:58.021 --> 01:13:00.635
you don't have any feelings for
him? I don't know.

01:13:01.941 --> 01:13:05.036
It's Nick.
When I first met your mother,

01:13:05.171 --> 01:13:07.835
it felt like someone set
my heart on fire.

01:13:07.941 --> 01:13:09.835
See, that's what I want.

01:13:09.941 --> 01:13:11.771
That feeling didn't last forever.

01:13:11.867 --> 01:13:14.266
Really? Even with Mom?

01:13:14.371 --> 01:13:16.216
My first year with her was great.

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:17.916
We were head over heels
with each other.

01:13:20.171 --> 01:13:21.786
But, frankly,
that didn't hold a candle

01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:23.606
to what we felt when
we moved back here.

01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:28.676
She became my
best friend, my partner.

01:13:30.421 --> 01:13:33.606
She knew me better than
anyone else in the world.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.660
When we first met...

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.996
...all we had was romance.

01:13:40.631 --> 01:13:44.556
It wasn't until I got to
know her that I knew I was in love.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.146
And then when you came along,

01:13:47.271 --> 01:13:49.066
well, that just grew.

01:13:51.021 --> 01:13:52.755
Dad... Loving your mother...

01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:56.066
...was the greatest
adventure I'll ever have.

01:13:57.811 --> 01:13:59.116
And more than anything,

01:13:59.221 --> 01:14:01.786
I want you to experience that.

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:11.356
So, if you think you can find that with
Cole, then you should chase after him.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.606
Even if it means missing
Christmas with your old man.

01:14:17.091 --> 01:14:18.916
But if you want my honest opinion,

01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:22.476
love shouldn't require you to
leave your entire life behind.

01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:25.396
You can always try and find
a happy middle ground.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:31.556
I just want you to be sure that what
you're feeling is more than romance.

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:36.576
Other than that,
I will support you no matter what.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.916
Thanks, Dad.

01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:46.835
(CAR HORN)

01:14:50.811 --> 01:14:51.916
He's here.

01:14:53.421 --> 01:14:54.885
I'll help you with your bags.

01:15:00.141 --> 01:15:01.996
Hey. Hi.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.860
You ready? I

01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:07.526
I think so.

01:15:07.631 --> 01:15:09.066
Oh, Alan, hey, thank you.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.171
Let me grab that.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.246
Have fun. I

01:15:13.381 --> 01:15:16.476
Go have yourself a romantic
Christmas whirlwind.

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:20.885
Thanks, Dad.

01:15:23.091 --> 01:15:25.606
You almost forgot this. Dad!

01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:27.276
Just take it. He's your best friend.

01:15:27.421 --> 01:15:29.316
The least you can do is
open his Christmas gift.

01:15:32.601 --> 01:15:33.775
You keep an eye on her.

01:15:34.961 --> 01:15:36.016
Will do, sir. I

01:15:39.271 --> 01:15:40.526
Hey. You OK?

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.780
Yeah.

01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:48.116
I'm just going to talk to
your dad for a minute.

01:17:16.201 --> 01:17:17.715
Ready when you are, garcon.

01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:22.965
Hey, is everything OK? Yeah.

01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:27.076
Yeah. It's just a
Christmas present from Nick.

01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:29.281
Oh, that's nice.

01:17:31.561 --> 01:17:32.796
I like that little guy.

01:17:37.231 --> 01:17:39.326
Yeah. I do too.

01:17:41.351 --> 01:17:44.046
Can we stop? Yeah, absolutely.

01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:45.715
What's wrong?

01:17:47.181 --> 01:17:49.076
I think I'm making a mistake.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.326
I got caught up in the whirlwind.

01:17:57.461 --> 01:17:59.515
And I'm afraid that once the
excitement dies off...

01:18:01.031 --> 01:18:02.391
...I'll regret what I left behind.

01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:09.356
You're great, Cole. You really are.

01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:12.436
And these past few weeks
have been incredible.

01:18:12.591 --> 01:18:15.006
And the thought of being whisked
away to Europe,

01:18:15.101 --> 01:18:16.926
like how my parents met, is a dream.

01:18:18.201 --> 01:18:20.256
But maybe it really is
a dream, you know?

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:27.046
Maybe I already have something
real here waiting for me.

01:18:27.181 --> 01:18:30.246
Sarah, I can't make you
come with me, but...

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:33.206
...l do need to leave. I'm sorry.

01:18:36.821 --> 01:18:39.206
I guess I don't just want adventure.

01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:41.176
I want true love.

01:18:41.311 --> 01:18:42.996
And I think I found that
a long time ago.

01:18:45.311 --> 01:18:48.356
I just didn't see it.
As long as you're happy.

01:18:53.951 --> 01:18:55.076
Sarah!

01:19:00.821 --> 01:19:02.092
Nick?

01:19:08.866 --> 01:19:11.961
Hey. I was afraid I'd missed you.

01:19:13.147 --> 01:19:14.891
You're wearing my mom's scarf.

01:19:14.986 --> 01:19:15.986
Yeah.

01:19:17.627 --> 01:19:19.532
Didn't want you to go
to Paris without it.

01:19:22.067 --> 01:19:24.352
Look, I wanted to apologies.

01:19:24.507 --> 01:19:26.532
I'm really sorry
for how things ended.

01:19:26.666 --> 01:19:28.562
I don't want to stand
between you and romance,

01:19:28.666 --> 01:19:29.922
so if that's what you want...

01:19:35.197 --> 01:19:36.562
I don't want romance.

01:19:38.017 --> 01:19:39.641
I want love.

01:19:39.786 --> 01:19:43.352
And it wasn't until now that I
realized the way I feel about you,

01:19:43.457 --> 01:19:45.482
the way I've always felt about you,

01:19:45.627 --> 01:19:47.841
that's what
love really feels like.

01:20:05.307 --> 01:20:07.992
Seriously, Nick, these are really
good. Right? I know.

01:20:08.147 --> 01:20:10.682
Finally the world's going to
recognize my genius.

01:20:10.817 --> 01:20:13.711
Took them long enough. Hey, what's
happening with your travel writing?

01:20:13.817 --> 01:20:16.042
Uh, it would be exciting,

01:20:16.197 --> 01:20:19.841
but I don't think I want to leave my
whole life behind any more.

01:20:19.986 --> 01:20:24.992
Who knows? Maybe Amanda will sponsor
a fully-illustrated travel issue and

01:20:25.147 --> 01:20:27.711
we can stay here and
still see the world.

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:29.532
That sounds like a
happy middle ground.

01:20:33.866 --> 01:20:37.352
Well, all I know is that whatever
happens, it will be an adventure.

01:20:37.507 --> 01:20:39.282
And I'm glad I'll get to go
on it with you.

01:20:42.347 --> 01:20:44.881
I love you, Sarah. I love you too.

01:20:46.707 --> 01:20:48.761
Looks like I got my
Christmas wish after all.

01:20:50.377 --> 01:20:51.402
I guess I did too.

01:20:52.986 --> 01:20:55.506
You know, I think we're going to
need a new Christmas tradition,

01:20:55.557 --> 01:20:57.877
since, you know, we don't need to
build a snowman any more.

01:20:57.906 --> 01:21:00.922
No more Coles, please.
Please, no more Coles.
