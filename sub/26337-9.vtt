00:06.420 --> 00:08.836
Please welcome
my daughter Tilly.

00:08.939 --> 00:10.286
NARRATOR: --Chef
Ramsay was joined

00:10.389 --> 00:11.183
by his youngest daughter--

00:11.287 --> 00:12.081
How's the boyfriend?

00:12.184 --> 00:13.151
I don't have one.

00:13.254 --> 00:14.048
Good, good, good, good.

00:14.152 --> 00:15.015
Keep it like that.

00:15.118 --> 00:16.257
NARRATOR: --and
challenged the chefs

00:16.361 --> 00:19.295
to create dishes for her
sweet 16 birthday party.

00:19.398 --> 00:20.192
Think teenagers.

00:20.296 --> 00:21.504
Don't go too complicated.

00:21.607 --> 00:23.057
I think she's not
your average kid.

00:23.161 --> 00:26.060
NARRATOR: On the red team, Mottodazzled Tilly with his dish.

00:26.164 --> 00:26.957
I think that's a yes.

00:27.061 --> 00:27.855
Thank you.

00:27.958 --> 00:29.029
NARRATOR: As did Jose.

00:29.132 --> 00:30.685
I love it and definitelywent it on the menu.

00:30.789 --> 00:31.997
Thank you, Tilly.

00:32.101 --> 00:34.034
NARRATOR: While Scotley,Trev, and Bret all fell short.

00:34.137 --> 00:35.380
These are not for
my 16th birthday.

00:35.483 --> 00:37.071
Not for your 16th
birthday party.

00:37.175 --> 00:38.797
Trying to impress
a 16-year-old

00:38.900 --> 00:40.074
girl never worked for me.

00:40.178 --> 00:41.696
But does that really
surprise anybody?

00:41.800 --> 00:43.388
NARRATOR: On the blue
team, Roe's efforts

00:43.491 --> 00:44.423
to impress Tilly--

00:44.527 --> 00:45.700
Tried to play it
in the shape of a T

00:45.804 --> 00:46.805
because it's Tilly's night.

00:46.908 --> 00:48.565
NARRATOR: --didn't
exactly spell success.

00:48.669 --> 00:49.877
I think I'm going
to pass on this one.

00:49.980 --> 00:52.224
NARRATOR: But the rest of thewomen each scored a point.

00:52.328 --> 00:53.467
This is a wow dish.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.020
Ladies in the house.

00:55.124 --> 00:57.540
NARRATOR: Winning the challengeand earning an afternoon

00:57.643 --> 00:59.887
at a Malibu mansion.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.269
At Tilly's sweet 16 party--

01:02.372 --> 01:03.787
Happy birthday, Tilly.

01:03.891 --> 01:06.031
NARRATOR: --Trevor andScotley clashed yet again.

01:06.135 --> 01:07.550
That's too much garlic, man.

01:07.653 --> 01:08.896
I would never talk
to somebody the way

01:08.999 --> 01:10.000
that Scotley talks to people.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.002
Garlic, lightly sauteed first.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.419
You didn't listen to me,and look what happened.

01:14.522 --> 01:15.799
NARRATOR: But the
rookies on the red team

01:15.903 --> 01:18.492
worked well together,
firing on all cylinders.

01:18.595 --> 01:20.804
GORDON RAMSAY: Jose,Motto, absolutely perfect.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.116
Thank you, Chef.

01:22.220 --> 01:24.670
Jose, Motto, me-- we're aforce to be reckoned with.

01:24.774 --> 01:26.603
NARRATOR: On the blueteam, one of their rookies,

01:26.707 --> 01:29.537
Mia struggled to deliver
proper fish and chips.

01:29.641 --> 01:31.470
It's fucking ice cold.

01:31.574 --> 01:34.542
NARRATOR: And Roe, steak
queen from season 13,

01:34.646 --> 01:36.406
could not get her
temperatures right.

01:36.510 --> 01:38.167
No sear there, cremated there.

01:38.270 --> 01:39.720
NARRATOR: The little
blue team lost.

01:39.823 --> 01:41.170
Get out!

01:41.273 --> 01:42.585
You'd be feeling pretty goodif you were the red right now,

01:42.688 --> 01:44.069
wouldn't you?NARRATOR: And nominated--

01:44.173 --> 01:45.277
Roe, Chef.
NARRATOR: --and--

01:45.381 --> 01:46.692
Mia.

01:46.796 --> 01:49.039
NARRATOR: But Mia was quick topoint a finger at someone else.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.317
I didn't set it up, Chef.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.214
Who set it up?

01:51.318 --> 01:52.181
Kanae set it up.

01:52.284 --> 01:53.423
She's trying to
play the blame game.

01:53.527 --> 01:54.907
NARRATOR: Chef
Ramsay eliminated--

01:55.011 --> 01:56.288
Roe.

01:56.392 --> 01:58.532
NARRATOR: --ending her dreamof becoming the executive chef

01:58.635 --> 02:00.568
at Gordon Ramsay'sHell's Kitchen Restaurant

02:00.672 --> 02:03.468
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:03.571 --> 02:06.471
And now the continuation
of "Hell's Kitchen."

02:06.574 --> 02:07.437
Get out of here.

02:07.541 --> 02:10.026
Yes, Chef.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.821
I'm sure it's because
I've had [inaudible]..

02:13.650 --> 02:16.688
All that back and forth
between him and Kanae.

02:16.791 --> 02:18.103
The girls are fractured.

02:18.207 --> 02:20.933
It's like somebody just drovea stake right into the middle

02:21.037 --> 02:22.038
of the blue team.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.420
And you can just see
the cracks coming out.

02:24.523 --> 02:26.560
Listen, I nominated
you because I

02:26.663 --> 02:27.457
don't want to be up there.

02:27.561 --> 02:28.769
And I feel like--

02:28.872 --> 02:30.495
Yeah, so you had to blamesomebody, so it had to be me

02:30.598 --> 02:31.427
to blame.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.187
I-- I thought--

02:33.291 --> 02:35.016
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.- Listen, I just--

02:35.120 --> 02:36.294
I know.We still got to be a team.

02:36.397 --> 02:37.053
We have to come togetherright now because tomorrow

02:37.157 --> 02:38.019
we got a big fucking job.

02:38.123 --> 02:38.882
We've still got
to be a team again.

02:38.986 --> 02:39.607
I know.
We're coming together.

02:39.711 --> 02:41.022
We're talking about it.

02:41.126 --> 02:42.127
[inaudible],, but the negativeenergy has to leave the room.

02:42.231 --> 02:43.991
I know, but I feel like
we have to talk about it

02:44.094 --> 02:45.406
to move on.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.581
We definitely need those twoto put their differences aside.

02:47.684 --> 02:51.723
But at the same time, the morethose two are at each other,

02:51.826 --> 02:54.174
the more it's going
to benefit me.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.520
I'm not an evil person--

02:55.623 --> 02:57.384
I swear.

02:57.487 --> 03:01.629
Ariel is about to just todestroy the rest of that team.

03:01.733 --> 03:05.702
She's a gangster bitch,
and she can cook.

03:05.806 --> 03:09.189
[theme music]

03:49.194 --> 03:51.645
So let's check in with
the weather, and it's--

03:51.748 --> 03:54.786

03:54.889 --> 03:56.408

03:56.512 --> 03:57.478
This is Trevor.

04:15.703 --> 04:18.603
[music playing]

Amazing.

04:47.425 --> 04:51.670

04:59.506 --> 05:00.300
Oh.

05:00.403 --> 05:01.404
Oh, nice.

05:01.508 --> 05:02.578
I'm joking, you Muppets.

05:02.681 --> 05:04.959
Of course, it's Chinese.

05:05.063 --> 05:06.133
Now listen carefully.

05:06.236 --> 05:09.239
For this challenge we've
got five Chinese boxes--

05:09.343 --> 05:10.862
spot prawns, chicken
breast, pork tenderloin,

05:10.965 --> 05:12.760
duck breast, and black cod.

05:12.864 --> 05:18.007
Jose, who in the blue teamwould you love to cook against?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.457
I would say Kanae, Chef.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.010
GORDON RAMSAY: Kanae.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.184
I'm excited to
cook against Jose.

05:23.288 --> 05:24.738
He's the first one to pick.

05:24.841 --> 05:28.293
So it makes me feel good becausehe sees me as competition.

05:28.397 --> 05:29.708
Bring it on, Jose.

05:29.812 --> 05:34.541
Kanae, what protein would youlike to select to take on Jose?

05:34.644 --> 05:36.128
- Prawns, Chef.
- Prawns.

05:36.232 --> 05:37.026
Right.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.268
Both of you, come up.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.891
Do not open that box.

05:39.994 --> 05:41.410
Next up, Mia.

05:41.513 --> 05:43.757
I would like to cook
against Trev, Chef.

05:43.860 --> 05:44.758
Let's go with the pork.

05:44.861 --> 05:45.897
GORDON RAMSAY: The pork.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.589
MIA: [laughs] That was a
poor choice on his end.

05:48.693 --> 05:50.142
Puerto Ricans love pork.

05:50.246 --> 05:51.592
GORDON RAMSAY: Mia versus Trev.

05:51.696 --> 05:52.490
Excellent.

05:52.593 --> 05:53.387
Motto.

05:53.491 --> 05:54.975
Ariel, chef.

05:55.078 --> 05:55.872
Ariel.

05:55.976 --> 05:57.011
Why?

05:57.115 --> 05:58.806
To be the best, you
got to beat the best.

05:58.910 --> 06:00.705
Damn straight, I'm
the best chef here.

06:00.808 --> 06:02.741
Let's do duck.

06:02.845 --> 06:04.294
GORDON RAMSAY: Duck.
Thank you.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.744
Heather.
HEATHER: Bret.

06:05.848 --> 06:06.745
Let's go with the cod, Chef.

06:06.849 --> 06:08.022
GORDON RAMSAY: The cod.

06:08.126 --> 06:12.095
Scotley, that means you'llbe cooking chicken breast.

06:12.199 --> 06:16.514
Now which one of you four isprepared to cook two dishes

06:16.617 --> 06:19.931
and go up against Scotley?

06:20.034 --> 06:21.795
I feel like whoever
has the cod or the--

06:21.898 --> 06:22.830
Prawns.

06:22.934 --> 06:23.417
Yeah, prawns are
going to be quick.

06:23.521 --> 06:24.314
All right.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.730
You have quick prawns, so OK.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.560
I'm excited to take on both.

06:28.664 --> 06:30.010
At this point in
the competition,

06:30.113 --> 06:32.184
I have to show them who's best.

06:32.288 --> 06:33.462
If you need help,
just let me know.

06:33.565 --> 06:34.359
Yeah.

06:34.463 --> 06:35.671
Yeah, we can help.

06:35.774 --> 06:38.708
Inside each box are
eight fortune cookies

06:38.812 --> 06:40.261
printed with the name
of the ingredients

06:40.365 --> 06:42.298
to use with your protein.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.438
Your 45 minutes starts now.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.682
Let's go.

06:46.785 --> 06:48.028
Go, go, go, go.

06:48.131 --> 06:50.340
Time to start
smashing these cookies.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.722

07:02.974 --> 07:03.802
Smoked prawns.

07:03.906 --> 07:04.769
This smoked prawns?
- Yes.

07:04.872 --> 07:05.701
All right.

07:05.804 --> 07:07.047
Get the prawns.

07:07.150 --> 07:07.944
Looks good.

07:08.048 --> 07:09.187
Oh, shit.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.327
They're alive.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.018
And they're moving.

07:13.122 --> 07:14.399
It's still moving.

07:14.503 --> 07:15.296
Come on.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.194
Let's move.

07:18.299 --> 07:20.405
Easy, cheesy, easy.

07:20.509 --> 07:21.751
Fucking motor mouth.

07:21.855 --> 07:24.202
Trevor just knows how
to say the right things

07:24.305 --> 07:25.514
to really set me off.

07:26.963 --> 07:27.930
I'm not getting my pussy hurt.

07:28.033 --> 07:29.414
You're just talking
a lot of shit.

07:29.518 --> 07:31.830
Enough of that
nonsense already.

07:31.934 --> 07:32.728
What are you doing?

07:32.831 --> 07:33.798
Duck three ways.

07:33.901 --> 07:35.247
Three ways.

07:35.351 --> 07:38.527
I'm competing against Ariel,who I know is very technical,

07:38.630 --> 07:41.426
but doesn't quite think
outside the box as much.

07:41.530 --> 07:42.807
How bad you want this?

07:42.910 --> 07:45.326
I'm not going to
quack under pressure.

07:45.430 --> 07:47.087
Coming for you, Ariel.

07:47.190 --> 07:49.227
Gentlemen, just under halfway.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.573
What kind of
sauce on the noodle?

07:50.677 --> 07:52.679
You're going to use the prawnhead sauce for the noodle?

07:52.782 --> 07:54.991
Yes, prawn head and cashew.

07:55.095 --> 07:57.028
But you need me to tasteit because you're allergic.

07:57.131 --> 07:58.270
Yeah.

07:58.374 --> 08:00.100
I'm allergic to nuts asfar as, like, eating them.

08:00.203 --> 08:02.965
So Ariel, you are
my taste tester.

08:03.068 --> 08:05.381
It needs more salt
to the sweetness.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.764
I mean, I have to createtwo dishes instead of one.

08:08.867 --> 08:11.732
So I am going to call
for help when I need it.

08:11.836 --> 08:12.906
ARIEL: Good.

08:13.009 --> 08:14.632
Do you have any limejuice you can hit it with?

08:14.735 --> 08:15.529
60 seconds to go.

08:15.633 --> 08:16.530
Come on.

08:16.634 --> 08:17.669
KANAE: Whoever is
done first, I need

08:17.773 --> 08:19.050
help plating the rest of this.

08:19.153 --> 08:20.361
Where's it that?

08:20.465 --> 08:21.535
Chicken is right there.

08:21.639 --> 08:23.157
I have my noodles right here.

08:23.261 --> 08:24.158
ARIEL: We got it.

08:24.262 --> 08:25.401
How's that chicken
breast doing?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.714
Nice sexy chicken stir fry.

08:27.817 --> 08:28.646
Fucking beautiful.

08:28.749 --> 08:29.750
I'll take it.

08:29.854 --> 08:36.792
GORDON RAMSAY: 5, 4,
3, 2, 1, and stop.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.138
Well done.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.761
Now I brought in a
very special judge.

08:40.865 --> 08:43.143
This chef knows Chinese cuisine.

08:43.246 --> 08:45.352
And she's just opened
her brand new restaurant

08:45.455 --> 08:46.456
Steamers Company.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.803
Chef Shirley Chung.

08:47.906 --> 08:49.321
[applause]

08:49.425 --> 08:50.737
You didn't even have
to say her last name.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.842
I knew who he was talking about.

08:52.946 --> 08:53.774
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.

08:53.878 --> 08:54.879
Thank you for having me.

08:54.982 --> 08:56.915
MIA: I heard from people
who worked with her,

08:57.019 --> 08:59.815
she was an amazing
chef, an amazing mentor.

08:59.918 --> 09:02.024
So I'm really
excited to see her.

09:02.127 --> 09:03.508
We're going to be
tasting the dishes

09:03.612 --> 09:05.234
head to head by proteins.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.548
Let's begin with the battleof the pork tenderloin.

09:08.651 --> 09:11.861
Mia from the blue and
Trev from the red.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.863
TREVOR: I was looking over atMia's, and it looks like she

09:13.967 --> 09:15.313
did some kind of weirdo salad.

09:15.416 --> 09:18.074
So I'm like, oh, OK, I
actually made a dish.

09:18.178 --> 09:20.180
What the fuck does
she do over there?

09:20.283 --> 09:21.837
Trev, why don't you
start first and describe

09:21.940 --> 09:23.010
the dish to Chef please?

09:23.114 --> 09:25.047
I did a spice rub
pork tenderloin.

09:25.150 --> 09:28.015
Togarashi and some star aniseon there on the outside.

09:28.119 --> 09:29.292
I feel the nice heat.

09:29.396 --> 09:31.571
I do want to point
out this plate

09:31.674 --> 09:33.124
doesn't come off very Chinese.

09:33.227 --> 09:34.574
OK.

09:34.677 --> 09:36.990
SHIRLEY CHUNG: You have noodleplated with pork on top versus

09:37.093 --> 09:37.991
if you plate on the plate.

09:38.094 --> 09:39.130
OK.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.890
And then the cookery
of pork tenderloin,

09:40.994 --> 09:42.271
I think it's a little
bit on the dry side.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.583
Apologies, Chef.

09:43.686 --> 09:47.276
She's really nitpickingevery detail that's going on.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.105
I'm like, this isn't
good right off the bat.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.728
Mia, please describe
the dish to Chef.

09:50.831 --> 09:53.869
MIA: I went with a soy andginger-glazed pork tenderloin.

09:53.972 --> 09:56.285
And then I did a stir
fry with the vegetables.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.150
This is not only
visually beautiful,

09:59.253 --> 10:00.323
but it's really delicious.

10:00.427 --> 10:01.497
Thank you, Chef.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.843
Does the point belong
to Mia and the blue team

10:02.947 --> 10:04.569
or Trevor and the red team?

10:04.673 --> 10:05.777
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Chef.

10:05.881 --> 10:06.675
GORDON RAMSAY: Hands down.

10:06.778 --> 10:07.814
HEATHER: Good job, Mia.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.781
I lost out to the young
whippersnapper again.

10:09.885 --> 10:11.472
You know, that little girlworries me a little bit.

10:11.576 --> 10:12.370
I'm not going to lie.

10:12.473 --> 10:13.992
Next up, black cod.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.684
Heather and Bret, let's go.

10:15.787 --> 10:16.892
Right.

10:16.995 --> 10:18.410
Let's start off withHeather this time, shall we?

10:18.514 --> 10:21.793
Chef, what I made for youis a black ramen miso soup.

10:21.897 --> 10:25.314
I poached the black cod
in the actual broth.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.110
Overall, your whole entiredish-- it is very sweet.

10:28.213 --> 10:29.249
Sweet.

10:29.352 --> 10:31.009
SHIRLEY CHUNG: Between
the acid, the spice,

10:31.113 --> 10:35.600
I think it's Asian ingredient,but not necessarily Chinese.

10:35.704 --> 10:36.774
Bret, explain please.

10:36.877 --> 10:39.259
So here I have apan-seared cod with Chinese

10:39.362 --> 10:41.295
five spice and powdered ginger.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.539
The miso butter is notnecessary at all for this dish.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.058
But the cod is
really well-cooked.

10:45.161 --> 10:45.955
Thank you, Chef.

10:46.059 --> 10:47.681
Absolutely.

10:47.785 --> 10:49.338
I think this one's
going to the red team.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.650
BRET: Chef, it's a
pleasure meeting you.

10:50.753 --> 10:52.099
Thank you, Chef.

10:52.203 --> 10:53.135
ARIEL: I'm really nervous.

10:53.238 --> 10:54.550
She's a tough judge.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.174
And I think that we were allin this fluff zone of working

10:58.278 --> 10:59.486
with Chinese cuisine.

10:59.589 --> 11:01.246
And now we have
to follow through

11:01.350 --> 11:03.732
with actual Chinese cuisine.

11:03.835 --> 11:05.112
It's very well-seasoned.

11:05.216 --> 11:07.908
They taste good, but Chinesecuisine has this thing that you

11:08.012 --> 11:09.703
want to-- all the shapes match.

11:09.807 --> 11:12.844
So you have long bean
going with your noodles.

11:12.948 --> 11:15.295
But you have big
chunk of chicken.

11:15.398 --> 11:18.781
Her critiques are so
thorough and so intense.

11:18.885 --> 11:20.334
It's very intimidating.

11:20.438 --> 11:23.096
Traditionally thiscombination really works.

11:23.199 --> 11:26.099
But in this case, it's notcoming together as a whole.

11:26.202 --> 11:28.860
Does the point go to Scotley,or does the point go to Kanae?

11:28.964 --> 11:30.068
This is my pick.

11:30.172 --> 11:31.691
Scotty, you deserve the points.- Thank you, Chef.

11:31.794 --> 11:32.484
GORDON RAMSAY: Scotley,
congratulations.

11:32.588 --> 11:33.347
HEATHER: Congrats, Scotley.

11:41.114 --> 11:43.806
My dish is not even closeto being what she's saying

11:43.910 --> 11:45.325
to everyone else
about how I should be

11:45.428 --> 11:46.498
able to get some in every bite.

11:46.602 --> 11:47.499
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

11:47.603 --> 11:50.813
Next up, duck breast,
Motto and Ariel.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.953
When I think of Chinesecuisine, it screams duck.

11:53.057 --> 11:53.920
Beijing duck, right?

11:54.023 --> 11:54.852
GORDON RAMSAY: Beijing duck.

11:54.955 --> 11:56.025
I'm from Beijing.

11:56.129 --> 11:57.026
Are you guys ready?

11:57.130 --> 11:58.510
Good luck.

11:58.614 --> 11:59.408
I'm totally fucked.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.892
Oh, wow.

12:00.996 --> 12:02.411
GORDON RAMSAY: Interestingchoice of plate.

12:09.211 --> 12:11.247
NARRATOR: In today'sChinese cuisine challenge,

12:11.351 --> 12:14.423
guest judge and Beijing
native Shirley Chung

12:14.526 --> 12:17.771
is dissecting each dishdown to the smallest detail.

12:17.875 --> 12:21.637
This plate doesn't
come off very Chinese.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.882
Overall, your whole entiredish-- it tastes very sweet.

12:24.985 --> 12:26.573
It's not coming
together as a whole.

12:26.676 --> 12:29.576
NARRATOR: And with the blueteam one point away from losing,

12:29.679 --> 12:33.097
self-assured Ariel isnot feeling so confident.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.512
ARIEL: I'm thinking
about my dish,

12:34.615 --> 12:37.791
and I'm just like, I know theChinese ingredients are there.

12:37.895 --> 12:39.828
But my dish was meant
to be, like, served

12:39.931 --> 12:41.070
with two shared plates.

12:41.174 --> 12:42.831
GORDON RAMSAY: Interestingchoice of plates.

12:42.934 --> 12:45.385
This is elongated
Chinese plate.

12:45.488 --> 12:48.491
I can see that.

12:48.595 --> 12:50.079
It's a little bit
difficult to eat.

12:50.183 --> 12:52.254
I think if you on this--maybe a large oval plate--

12:52.357 --> 12:53.393
Yeah.

12:53.496 --> 12:54.843
SHIRLEY CHUNG: --just
a little bit better.

12:54.946 --> 12:56.776
But flavors-- really good.

12:56.879 --> 12:57.673
Thank you, Chef.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.468
It's just very awkward to eat.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.572
Motto.

13:00.676 --> 13:02.160
So here I have duck
three ways for you.

13:02.264 --> 13:03.472
SHIRLEY CHUNG: Oh, wow.

13:03.575 --> 13:06.026
MOTTO: Duck fried rice, fivespice grilled duck breast,

13:06.130 --> 13:08.511
and a little duckcrackling or chicharrones.

13:08.615 --> 13:12.308
Um, do you use Sichuan
peppercorn in this?

13:12.412 --> 13:14.414
Yes, in the
charred plum sauce.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.554
While you bit into
it, it literally just

13:16.657 --> 13:17.831
took over everything.

13:17.935 --> 13:19.074
So it numbs your palate.

13:19.177 --> 13:20.282
Heard that.

13:20.385 --> 13:21.973
Chef, does the point goto Ariel on the blue team

13:22.077 --> 13:23.906
or Motto on the red team?

13:24.010 --> 13:25.045
Ariel.
GORDON RAMSAY: Ariel.

13:25.149 --> 13:25.943
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

13:26.046 --> 13:27.427
Great job.

13:27.530 --> 13:29.739
I wanted to go
against Ariel because I

13:29.843 --> 13:32.259
felt like she was the strongest,and I wanted that challenge.

13:32.363 --> 13:33.916
They both swung hard.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.091
That was a mistake.

13:36.194 --> 13:41.337
2-2, and it all comes down tothe spot prawn, Kanae and Jose.

13:41.441 --> 13:43.684
Oh, tiebreaker.

13:43.788 --> 13:45.514
GORDON RAMSAY: Jose, describeyour dish please to Chef.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.034
JOSE: This dish, I servedthe prawns with the head on.

13:48.137 --> 13:51.175
So the idea is to suck outthe juice out the head.

13:51.278 --> 13:52.728
I am going to
follow your direction.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.696
I'm going to suck the head.

13:55.800 --> 13:56.663
Please suck the head.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.668
Wow, flavorful.

14:04.602 --> 14:06.293
That is more season
than the noodle.

14:06.397 --> 14:07.329
Mm-hmm.

14:07.432 --> 14:09.434
SHIRLEY CHUNG: How
does that happen?

14:09.538 --> 14:11.126
GORDON RAMSAY: Kanae,describe your dish to Chef.

14:11.229 --> 14:15.509
I have a cold cashew
sauce with the prawns

14:15.613 --> 14:16.545
that are poached.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.305
The fact that I'm
allergic to nuts,

14:18.409 --> 14:21.343
I just have to depend on Ariel.

14:21.446 --> 14:23.897
[inaudible] Chinese,
very aromatic.

14:24.001 --> 14:25.416
Flavor's really good,
but I think it's

14:25.519 --> 14:27.487
a little bit on the dry side.

14:27.590 --> 14:28.419
Right.

14:28.522 --> 14:30.662
Take the dishes back in line.

14:30.766 --> 14:34.045
Please let theseflavors just pull through.

14:34.149 --> 14:36.392
The big question is, doesthe point go to the blue team

14:36.496 --> 14:37.290
or the red team?

14:40.949 --> 14:42.260
The blue team.GORDON RAMSAY: Blue team.

14:42.364 --> 14:43.227
- Oh!
- Yes.

14:43.330 --> 14:44.711
Yes!

14:44.814 --> 14:45.712
Thank you.

14:45.815 --> 14:46.609
Yes!

14:49.302 --> 14:50.372
Your brain, my mouth.

14:50.475 --> 14:52.546
Yes.

14:52.650 --> 14:54.100
Join me in thanking
this incredible chef

14:54.203 --> 14:55.791
for giving up her day.
- Thank you.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.723
Thank you so much.

14:56.826 --> 14:57.620
Thank you, Chef.

14:57.724 --> 14:59.208
Thank you.

14:59.312 --> 15:00.244
Ladies, congratulations.

15:00.347 --> 15:01.728
[TOGETHER] Thank you, Chef.

15:01.831 --> 15:03.557
The girls are
reaping all the rewards

15:03.661 --> 15:05.835
and having all the goodtimes and all the relaxation.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.424
The one reward that I gotto go on, we were on safari,

15:08.528 --> 15:11.358
and we got a fucking stupid hat.

15:11.462 --> 15:13.705
You're all in for
an amazing treat.

15:13.809 --> 15:15.569
All of you are
going to the place

15:15.673 --> 15:19.332
that will be the home of thewinner of "Hell's Kitchen."

15:19.435 --> 15:20.367
Oh, sh--

15:20.471 --> 15:22.369
We're going to Vegas!

15:22.473 --> 15:23.957
GORDON RAMSAY: That's
right, Las Vegas.

15:24.061 --> 15:26.926
You are in for anextraordinary VIP experience.

15:27.029 --> 15:28.858
I'm putting you up
in the private villa

15:28.962 --> 15:30.170
of The Noble Hotel.

15:33.346 --> 15:35.555
Fuck that.

15:35.658 --> 15:37.281
Why are you standing
here staring at me?

15:37.384 --> 15:38.730
Your private plane is waiting.

15:38.834 --> 15:39.662
Oh my god!

15:39.766 --> 15:40.560
Thank you, Chef.

15:40.663 --> 15:41.561
Thank you, Chef!

15:41.664 --> 15:43.494
[cheering]

15:43.597 --> 15:46.221
I'm feeling like Beyoncemore and more every day.

15:46.324 --> 15:49.396
Private villa, private plane.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.090
My Vegas experiences havenever been like this.

15:53.193 --> 15:54.022
Yeah!

15:54.125 --> 15:55.092
Oh my god.

15:55.195 --> 15:56.956
I have to teach the
girls how to twerk.

15:57.059 --> 16:00.856
Men, today I've offered yourservices to a local vendor who

16:00.960 --> 16:04.515
provides fortune cookies
to Chinese restaurants

16:04.618 --> 16:06.931
all over Los Angeles.

16:07.035 --> 16:08.795
So guess what you'll be doing.

16:08.898 --> 16:10.314
Stuffing fortune cookies.

16:10.417 --> 16:13.041
Making them first.

16:13.144 --> 16:14.214
Guys, what are you waiting for?

16:14.318 --> 16:16.009
Go make a fortune--

16:16.113 --> 16:16.906
cookie.

16:20.427 --> 16:21.981
BRET: Enjoy Vegas,ladies, because it's going

16:22.084 --> 16:23.016
to be your last time there.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.397
Because my ass is
gonna be living

16:24.500 --> 16:27.193
there here soon enough and notjust visiting for the night.

16:27.296 --> 16:29.540
That's it.

16:29.643 --> 16:31.231
Confucius says--

16:31.335 --> 16:32.370
Men do not fail.

16:41.552 --> 16:42.691
It's not just any loss.

16:42.794 --> 16:43.692
It's a trip to Vegas.

16:53.081 --> 16:54.634
Scotley, carry your

19:13.600 --> 19:15.430
We're not even close to
filling up the bucket.

The more you talk, the more it'sgoing to be fucking annoying,

19:56.402 --> 19:57.230

Wow, I just said
one thing, bro.

I'm going to lay down.

going through there.

20:43.897 --> 20:44.726
I know.

20:44.829 --> 20:46.037
That's why I'm not talking.

20:46.141 --> 20:49.178
Scotley is just a fuckingdouchebag the entire time.

20:49.282 --> 20:51.319
He fucking was taking
eggs we're supposed

20:51.422 --> 20:54.011
to use for the fucking cookies,boiling eggs, and making him

20:54.114 --> 20:55.323

21:10.579 --> 21:11.960
I'm just sick of it.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.133
It's going to fester.

21:13.237 --> 21:15.826
It's going to be like

Like, this is a hot mess.

21:33.844 --> 21:36.053

Get your water

Yes, boss.
No problem, boss.

Out in-- what the fuckdoes he mean, out in one?

24:45.449 --> 24:46.312
Fucking hell.

24:46.415 --> 24:48.072
I'm so confused.

Let's go.

Eight minute out, y'all.

25:11.889 --> 25:13.512
I'm a little worried
that Trev and Scotley

25:13.615 --> 25:15.479
are still kind of going at it.

25:15.583 --> 25:17.550
There's definitely a
little bit of a divide.

25:17.654 --> 25:19.932
But we've got to keep theteamwork going during service

25:20.035 --> 25:21.243
and worry about that shit later.

25:21.347 --> 25:22.313
All right.

About five minutes
out on that risotto.

25:23.591 --> 25:24.592
Firing scallop.

25:24.695 --> 25:25.903
Just make sure you
get a really nice sear.

25:26.007 --> 25:27.802
Stop moving them around so much.

25:27.905 --> 25:29.355
Let them color.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.253
Jose, I haven't
even cooked anything.

25:31.357 --> 25:33.152

25:34.809 --> 25:35.810

26:29.622 --> 26:30.761
I'm just saying,
you're not going

26:30.865 --> 26:32.073
to kick me off my station.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.144
Nobody is getting kickedoff the station, Trevor.

26:34.247 --> 26:35.421
I know, but he
already threatened it.

26:35.524 --> 26:37.388
No, the fuck you cannot.

26:37.492 --> 26:40.081
You got to leave thatbullshit at the time clock

26:40.184 --> 26:41.392

Jose, you don't need
to be put Wellingtons

28:43.376 --> 28:44.205
in the oven for Scotley.

more svelte looking black man.

28:56.424 --> 28:57.666
Hey, what the hell?

28:57.770 --> 28:59.392
If you wanted to play witheach other's meat that much,

29:01.291 --> 29:02.602

GORDON RAMSAY: It's crisp,and it's fucking burned.

29:13.475 --> 29:14.269
Hey, guys.

29:14.373 --> 29:15.892
Yes, Chef.

29:15.995 --> 29:16.789
Fucking skin is burned.

29:16.893 --> 29:18.101
Why is the skin

29:18.204 --> 29:19.378
Come on, fellas.
Fuck.

29:19.481 --> 29:20.275

29:21.380 --> 29:22.830

29:22.933 --> 29:23.865
Yes, Chef, there was.

Trevor, come on, yo.

29:25.384 --> 29:26.592
- I'm taking over now, OK?- Fine.

29:26.695 --> 29:27.973
Go ahead.

29:28.076 --> 29:30.423
Trev has ridden this"Hell's Kitchen" bus before.

29:30.527 --> 29:32.667
So the fact that he's
struggling worries me.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.599
Check it out.
Look.

29:33.702 --> 29:34.738
You see how I got

29:37.534 --> 29:38.742
That's it.
All you gotta do.

29:38.846 --> 29:40.261
You know, I don't want
it to get to that point

29:40.364 --> 29:41.503
where it's too late.

29:41.607 --> 29:43.954
This group of five hada great service last time.

29:44.058 --> 29:46.025
I've got no idea
what's going on.

29:46.129 --> 29:47.406
I am lost for words!

29:47.509 --> 29:49.373
Yes, Chef.

29:49.477 --> 29:51.790
The salmon's fucked.

29:51.893 --> 29:53.067

Yes, Chef.

30:02.041 --> 30:02.870
Who's running the station?

30:05.631 --> 30:06.839
This would be my friend Jose.

30:06.943 --> 30:11.257
Have you met Jose, who doesn'tknow how to cook salmon?

30:11.361 --> 30:13.156
Don't you dare say we!

30:13.259 --> 30:14.295
Oh, wait.

30:14.398 --> 30:15.917
You have nothing to say?

30:16.021 --> 30:16.849
Jose's running.

30:16.953 --> 30:19.783
I'm backing him up
right now, Chef.

30:19.887 --> 30:20.680
Watch your back.

30:20.784 --> 30:22.717
Go ahead, down.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.856
Just make sure
it's not raw again.

30:23.960 --> 30:24.926
JOSE: I know.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.238
They're pissing in
the wind over there.

30:26.341 --> 30:27.687
They're going nowhere, man.

30:27.791 --> 30:29.068
I mean, you had some
raw fish too, so--

30:29.172 --> 30:31.899
I-- give me some
fucking salmon.

30:32.002 --> 30:32.934
It's already in.

30:33.038 --> 30:34.246
There's nothing you
can do to fix it.

30:34.349 --> 30:35.972
It's in the other, bro.

30:36.075 --> 30:38.181
All right.

30:38.284 --> 30:39.216
Two lamb, two halibut.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.666
Keep the countdown coming.- Yes, Chef.

30:40.769 --> 30:41.667
Yes, Chef.

30:41.770 --> 30:43.117
You have garnish

30:43.220 --> 30:44.152
Yes, I can walk it it in two.

30:44.256 --> 30:45.740
Walking in two.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.500
Walking garnish in two.

30:47.604 --> 30:49.606
There is such a good
synergy right now.

30:49.709 --> 30:50.883
We're talking to each other.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.299
It's like a whole
new world here.

30:53.403 --> 30:55.336
This is like a real
kitchen right now.

30:55.439 --> 30:56.958
I'm walking lamb, guys.

30:57.062 --> 30:59.133
Walking halibut, garnish.

30:59.236 --> 31:00.928
Behind.

31:01.031 --> 31:02.584
Walking halibut.

31:02.688 --> 31:04.172
I haven't been in a
real kitchen for weeks

31:04.276 --> 31:07.244
now because we keepflailing around like idiots.

31:07.348 --> 31:08.625
So feels good.

31:08.728 --> 31:09.971
It feels like I'm back to work.

31:10.075 --> 31:12.767
It feels like I'm doing whatI'm supposed to be doing.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.802
GORDON RAMSAY: Look at this.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.563
Ariel, come here.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.806
Yes, Chef.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.706
Hey, red team, come here.

31:20.809 --> 31:21.880
Hurry up.

31:21.983 --> 31:23.778
Just look at that.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.675
Textbook.

31:24.779 --> 31:25.573
Thank you, Chef.

31:25.676 --> 31:26.643
GORDON RAMSAY: Textbook.

31:26.746 --> 31:27.886
Fuck off, will you?

31:27.989 --> 31:28.817
Yeah?

31:28.921 --> 31:30.681
It's absolute
slap to the face.

31:30.785 --> 31:32.580
It's like gettingcurbstomped or something.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.444
Like, not even kicked
when you're down.

31:34.547 --> 31:37.205
This is the final blow.

31:37.309 --> 31:38.620
Perfect.

31:38.724 --> 31:40.381
I'm dragging two
salmon, two Wellington.

31:40.484 --> 31:41.382
How long?

31:41.485 --> 31:42.417
Minute and a half, Chef.

31:42.521 --> 31:43.867
Minute and a half, I'm ready.

31:43.971 --> 31:46.180
We're behind, Scotley, butI need you to bounce back now.

31:46.283 --> 31:48.009
Yes, Chef.

31:48.113 --> 31:51.530
This is breaking
the fuck apart, man.

31:51.633 --> 31:52.703
JOSE: How you looking
on Wellington?

31:52.807 --> 31:55.706
Shit's just falling apart, yo.

31:55.810 --> 31:58.640
Chef, my dough from the side ofthe Wellington is pulling up,

31:58.744 --> 31:59.538
Chef.

31:59.641 --> 32:01.091
The dough.

32:01.195 --> 32:02.230
My pastry.

32:02.334 --> 32:03.473
Bret, could you
show Scotley how

32:03.576 --> 32:05.026
to slice a fucking Wellington?

32:05.130 --> 32:06.407
Absolutely, Chef.

32:07.649 --> 32:08.443
I don't get it.

32:08.547 --> 32:09.755
What's the problem?

32:09.858 --> 32:11.101
Let the knife do the work.

32:11.205 --> 32:12.344
It's a serrated knife.

32:12.447 --> 32:16.693
1, 2, 3, you're
through the Wellington.

32:16.796 --> 32:19.006
It's glorious is
the word I'll use.

32:19.109 --> 32:22.319
I'm begging, dying for a twobeef Wellington, two salmon.

32:22.423 --> 32:23.700
Come on, man.

32:23.803 --> 32:24.597
Please.

32:24.701 --> 32:26.565
I need proteins.

32:26.668 --> 32:28.843
That's it.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.740
Wellies?

32:29.844 --> 32:31.259
Wellies right now.

32:31.363 --> 32:32.778
Yo, let the knife
do the work, right?

32:46.585 --> 32:49.036
Hey, red team, come here.

32:49.139 --> 32:51.935
Wellington, beautifully-cooked.

32:52.039 --> 32:54.938
Beautifully-cooked,
except that's

32:55.042 --> 32:57.320
from the fucking blue team.

32:57.423 --> 32:58.528
God damn.

32:58.631 --> 33:01.082
Look at the
fucking difference.

33:01.186 --> 33:03.326
That's perfection on a plate.

33:03.429 --> 33:06.225
That's undercooked, and it'sjust sabotaged the side.

33:06.329 --> 33:08.331
I've got no idea
what's going on.

33:08.434 --> 33:09.401
I am lost for words!

33:14.993 --> 33:17.754
[music playing]

33:17.857 --> 33:19.825
NARRATOR: It's one hour
into dinner service.

33:19.928 --> 33:22.000
Hey, red team, come here.

33:22.103 --> 33:24.726
Wellington, beautifully-cooked,except that's

33:24.830 --> 33:26.383

33:26.487 --> 33:28.627
NARRATOR: And Scotley'smangling of the Wellingtons

33:28.730 --> 33:31.975

33:32.079 --> 33:34.667
riddled with errors all night.

33:34.771 --> 33:35.841
Motherfucker.

33:35.944 --> 33:38.671
I'm just trying to show
perfection on a plate.

33:38.775 --> 33:41.433
That's undercooked, and it'sjust sabotaged the side.

33:41.536 --> 33:43.711
Look at the fucking difference.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.264
Come on, guys.
NARRATOR: Let's go.

33:45.368 --> 33:46.162
Do it again.

33:46.265 --> 33:48.854
Seriously?

33:48.957 --> 33:53.859
Jeez, I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6 tables left on their team.

33:53.962 --> 33:55.412
The halibut.
Prego.

34:01.108 --> 34:03.006
I'm down to my last
fucking table here now

34:03.110 --> 34:05.043
with these girls.

34:05.146 --> 34:06.941
Really good.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.288

of you, well done.

34:09.392 --> 34:10.427

34:25.063 --> 34:27.720
Dude, if over here,
then let me help you.

34:27.824 --> 34:29.619
Don't get defensive.

34:29.722 --> 34:31.483
It's not my fault
you're fucking up.

34:31.586 --> 34:33.105
Two salmon, two beef.
Let's go.

34:33.209 --> 34:34.210
Yes, Chef.

34:34.313 --> 34:35.176
What do you need, Jose?
How can I help you?

34:35.280 --> 34:36.281
Just a salmon.

34:36.384 --> 34:38.006
This salmon is, like,
not fucking cooking.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.629
Are we up on garnish
for two Wellingtons?

34:39.732 --> 34:41.113
- Yes, up.
- All right.

34:41.217 --> 34:42.252
Can you pull that?

34:42.356 --> 34:44.151
I need that Wellington
to go to Chef Christina.

34:44.254 --> 34:46.256
Coming out, salmon.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.533
I got the sauce right here.

34:47.637 --> 34:49.294
Just make sure that's donein the middle this time.

34:49.397 --> 34:50.433
Walking to the pass.

34:50.536 --> 34:51.779
Let's try it again.

34:51.882 --> 34:52.711
Chef, salmon.

34:55.507 --> 34:56.301
Look at this.

34:56.404 --> 34:57.440
That's still raw.

34:57.543 --> 34:59.131
It's still raw.- You're fucking kidding me.

34:59.235 --> 35:00.028
I can't.

35:02.893 --> 35:03.687
Hey.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.620
Hey, men.

35:05.724 --> 35:06.725

35:09.141 --> 35:09.935
Oh!

35:10.038 --> 35:12.455
The salmon is still fucking raw.

35:12.558 --> 35:14.250
The salmon is still raw.

35:14.353 --> 35:15.699
Put the ladle down.

35:15.803 --> 35:17.253
You, stand up straight.

35:17.356 --> 35:20.601
Red team, get out!

35:20.704 --> 35:21.533

He's kicking them out.

35:22.913 --> 35:25.537
Get out!

35:25.640 --> 35:28.781
Yo, my bad.

35:28.885 --> 35:32.233
Red team is completely
ousted from the kitchen.

35:32.337 --> 35:33.372
I'm done!

35:33.476 --> 35:34.408
Yes, Chef.

35:34.511 --> 35:35.271
Enough's enough.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.861
Hold your heads
in fucking shame!

35:39.965 --> 35:43.831
Hey, red team, maybe youcan do one thing together.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.558
Come up with two names thatyou could do without to make

35:46.661 --> 35:47.869
your team fucking shine.

35:47.973 --> 35:49.285
TREVOR: Yes, Chef.
SCOTLEY: Yes, Chef.

35:49.388 --> 35:50.355
Bullshit.

35:50.458 --> 35:51.528
Guys, get on this station.

35:51.632 --> 35:52.805
Get settled in the station.

35:52.909 --> 35:54.393
Make sure you have
everything you need.

35:54.497 --> 35:57.879
Next is two lobster, two
halibut, two chicken.

35:57.983 --> 36:00.330
[TOGETHER] Two lobster,two halibut, two chicken.

36:00.434 --> 36:01.780
Heard.
- All right.

36:01.883 --> 36:02.815
I'm sending the chicken.

36:02.919 --> 36:04.403
They got a big
mess to pick up here.

36:04.507 --> 36:05.266
All right.

36:05.370 --> 36:06.336
Halibut's ready.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.613
Get them nice and hot.

36:07.717 --> 36:09.063
I know it's hard.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.029
Keep it going.

36:10.133 --> 36:10.927
Behind.

36:11.030 --> 36:11.962
Hot, hot.

36:12.066 --> 36:13.826
I apologize for
the long delay.

36:13.930 --> 36:14.724
Oh my god.

36:14.827 --> 36:17.105
This is so good.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.624
Hey, ladies, well done.

36:18.728 --> 36:20.764
You didn't just pick upthe slack of the red team.

36:20.868 --> 36:22.076
You did 2/3 of their tables.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.222
I got to go with Jose andScotley or Trevor and Scotley.

36:30.326 --> 36:31.810
I'm going Trev and Scotley.

36:31.913 --> 36:34.502
One from meat, one from fish.

36:34.606 --> 36:36.987
The first two salmon that
was supposed to go up--

36:37.091 --> 36:38.472
Those are the ones
that were burned.

36:38.575 --> 36:40.405
I mean, the first twosalmon, yeah, I cooked it.

36:40.508 --> 36:42.752
But everything that Josetouched on fucking fish tonight

36:42.855 --> 36:44.374
came back raw.

36:44.478 --> 36:46.031
Tonight Jose wanted
to be a me, me, me.

36:46.134 --> 36:47.343
I know how to cook fish.
Me, me, me.

36:47.446 --> 36:48.689
I want to be the lead now.Me, me, me.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.311
I'm going to kick
you off your station.

36:50.415 --> 36:52.900
You, you, you fucked
up big time, buddy.

36:53.003 --> 36:55.143
Scotley, thoseWellingtons were fucked too.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.145
There's no reason for me toleave garnish in the middle

36:57.249 --> 36:58.250
of service for beef.

36:58.354 --> 36:59.147
Yes.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.873
Two of them was just miscut.

37:00.977 --> 37:02.703
Your salmon was fucked up.

37:02.806 --> 37:04.256
We pulled them outbecause you weren't ready.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.775
No, that was not on me.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.984
Those were pulled out becauseof the Welly, and they set.

37:08.087 --> 37:09.157
Get the fuck out of here.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.090
No, that was not on me.

37:11.194 --> 37:12.747
JOSE: Trevor never wantsto take any responsibility

37:12.851 --> 37:13.921
for anything.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.302
He's, like, only trying
to cover his own ass.

37:15.405 --> 37:17.407
They were paired
with the meat station.

37:17.511 --> 37:19.029
- It got sent back, right?- Yeah, fine.

37:19.133 --> 37:20.030
- No excuses, man.
- Fine.

37:20.134 --> 37:21.549
All right.
I'm not.

37:21.653 --> 37:22.447
Damn.

37:39.326 --> 37:44.607
Ladies, that was the servicethat I've been waiting for.

37:44.710 --> 37:46.194
Great job.
- Thank you, Chef.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.368
Thank you, Chef.

37:47.472 --> 37:53.167
Red team, they fedmore red diners than you.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.203
What the fuck is going on, Jose?

37:55.307 --> 37:57.067
There's just like a badvibe right now with the team.

37:57.171 --> 37:57.965
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.
OK.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.277
Thank you.
So it's a bad vibe.

37:59.380 --> 38:00.208
JOSE: A terrible vibe.- So you don't like each other.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.451
Some of us do not
like each other.

38:01.555 --> 38:03.557
Speak up.

38:03.660 --> 38:06.042
Feel like Trev is bringingthe team down, Chef.

38:06.145 --> 38:07.802
I don't feel like that at all.

38:07.906 --> 38:09.942
I'm running around, tryingto fill in any voids.

38:10.046 --> 38:11.496
Running around with
his clipboard, Chef.

38:11.599 --> 38:12.911
That's all he does.
- No, no.

38:13.014 --> 38:13.877
A clipboard?

38:13.981 --> 38:15.016
No, there needs
to be notes taken.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.086
Yeah, running around
with a notepad, Chef.

38:16.190 --> 38:17.053
- No, no.- That's what he does the best.

38:17.156 --> 38:18.606
Hey, I wasn't
boiling fucking eggs

38:18.710 --> 38:21.678
in the middle of a punishment.

38:21.782 --> 38:22.990
Making yourself a snack.

38:23.093 --> 38:24.232
OK.

38:24.336 --> 38:25.820
Smoking on the fuckingdeck, eating White Castles

38:25.924 --> 38:27.408
while we're all cutting shit.

38:27.512 --> 38:28.478
SCOTLEY: I cut more than you.

38:28.582 --> 38:29.790
I don't give a shit
how much you cut.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.136
It's a punishment.- OK, I cut way more than you.

38:31.239 --> 38:32.068
TREVOR: What are you
doing making lunch?

38:32.171 --> 38:33.069
SCOTLEY: And at
the end of the day,

38:33.172 --> 38:33.759
I was running
circles around you.

38:33.863 --> 38:34.104
You're making snacks!

38:40.904 --> 38:43.700
[music playing]

38:44.805 --> 38:45.840
I cut more than you.

38:45.944 --> 38:47.152
I don't give a shit
how much you cut.

38:47.255 --> 38:48.326
- OK, I cut way more than you.- It's a punishment.

38:48.429 --> 38:49.292
What are doing making lunch?

38:49.396 --> 38:50.258
SCOTLEY: And at
the end of the day,

38:50.362 --> 38:50.949
I was running
circles around you?

38:51.052 --> 38:51.467
You're making snacks!

38:54.193 --> 38:56.506
That's the bad vibe thatyou see right there, Chef.

38:56.610 --> 39:00.130
Bret, red team's first
nomination and why.

39:00.234 --> 39:01.787
Scotley, Chef.
GORDON RAMSAY: Scotley.

39:01.891 --> 39:03.237
You just witnessed
some of it right there.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.445
And based on
tonight's performance

39:04.549 --> 39:07.172
with the Wellingtons, horrible.

39:07.275 --> 39:09.761
Red team's second
nomination and why.

39:09.864 --> 39:12.522
That would be Trevor,
Chef, based on tonight's

39:12.626 --> 39:13.489
performance on fish.

39:13.592 --> 39:14.386
He broke down.

39:14.490 --> 39:15.801
He wanted to take the lead.

39:15.905 --> 39:17.493
We just didn't get
off to a good start.

39:17.596 --> 39:21.773
And there was also athird consideration, Chef.

39:21.876 --> 39:22.843
- Oh, jeez.
- Yup.

39:22.946 --> 39:23.913
A third.
Go on.

39:24.016 --> 39:25.293
Give it to me.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.606
And that was Jose, owningup to the horrible performance

39:27.710 --> 39:28.504
on the fish station, Chef.

39:28.607 --> 39:29.401
Right.

39:29.505 --> 39:30.782
Yeah, I understand that.

39:30.885 --> 39:36.304
Trevor, Scotley, and
Jose, step forward.

39:36.408 --> 39:40.239
Scotley, why should youstay over Jose and Trevor?

39:40.343 --> 39:41.309
I'm not giving up.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.345
I'm not bowing down.

39:42.449 --> 39:44.105
I can man up to my mistakes.

39:44.209 --> 39:45.693
I know that I could bounce back.

39:45.797 --> 39:47.523
You put me back on
that station tomorrow--

39:47.626 --> 39:49.697
I do it with perfection.

39:49.801 --> 39:50.974
Jose, same question.

39:51.078 --> 39:52.700
I'm ambitious.
I'm driven.

39:52.804 --> 39:54.461
I'm here for the main reasonto be the executive chef

39:54.564 --> 39:56.186
of Hell's Kitchen.And I want to stay, Chef.

39:56.290 --> 39:58.534
I'm here to continue topush and continue to grow.

39:58.637 --> 40:01.157
Trevor, what in the fuck'sgoing on with a clipboard?

40:01.260 --> 40:02.400
Clipboard, my ass.

40:02.503 --> 40:03.539
It's a notebook.

40:03.642 --> 40:05.644
Fucking hell.

40:05.748 --> 40:06.887
I'm not a clipboard chef.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.544
But you needed me to
find my voice last time.

40:08.647 --> 40:09.752
I have my voice.

40:09.855 --> 40:11.236
You need somebody to bea leader for these teams.

40:11.339 --> 40:12.133
I am.

40:15.447 --> 40:21.591
My decision is Trev.

40:25.526 --> 40:26.320
Back in line.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.217
Yes, Chef.

40:35.778 --> 40:41.266
Scotley, come here, young man.

40:41.369 --> 40:43.889
You came in here
all guns blazing,

40:43.993 --> 40:45.684
claimed to be the big bad wolf.

40:45.788 --> 40:48.618
It started off bloody strong.

40:48.722 --> 40:51.518
But tonight you were
like a lost lamb.

40:51.621 --> 40:52.864
Yes, Chef.

40:52.967 --> 40:53.830
Give me your jacket please.

40:56.764 --> 40:57.938
Thank you.
- Thank you, Chef.

40:58.041 --> 40:58.939
Good night.

40:59.042 --> 40:59.836
Good luck.

40:59.940 --> 41:02.045
Bye, Scotley.

41:02.149 --> 41:03.771
SCOTLEY: Trevor is a bitch.

41:03.875 --> 41:05.117
He is the weakest link.

41:05.221 --> 41:08.189
That red team is going tofall apart now that I'm gone.

41:08.293 --> 41:10.882
Trevor, baby girl, good luck.

41:10.985 --> 41:14.437
You four, that was a disaster.

41:14.541 --> 41:15.507
Get a grip.

41:15.611 --> 41:16.508
Yes, Chef.

41:16.612 --> 41:19.442
Fuck off.

41:19.546 --> 41:21.099
BRET: I felt personally
embarrassed today

41:21.202 --> 41:22.238
in the kitchen.

41:22.341 --> 41:24.482
So it was time to become
that monster I feel

41:24.585 --> 41:26.725
like that I was in season 14.

41:26.829 --> 41:28.278
Y'all ain't going to
like it, but it's going

41:28.382 --> 41:32.179
to get us through thesemotherfucking dinner services.

41:32.282 --> 41:36.045
The red team is completely
breaking down right now.

41:36.148 --> 41:39.980
They're so consumed right nowby their own hate for each other

41:40.083 --> 41:42.258
that they're just
not coming together.

41:42.361 --> 41:43.673
They're not getting it.

41:43.777 --> 41:45.019
TREVOR: There's no
room for Scotley's

41:45.123 --> 41:47.815
negativity in this competitionor this industry at all

41:47.919 --> 41:48.954
whatsoever.

41:49.058 --> 41:50.300
I've been busting my ass
trying to be a leader

41:50.404 --> 41:51.716
on my team for Christ's sake.

41:51.819 --> 41:53.752
I want this fucking
job more than anything.

41:53.856 --> 41:55.133
GORDON RAMSAY [VOICEOVER]:I really hoped

41:55.236 --> 41:57.273
that Scotley would
be the big, bad wolf

41:57.376 --> 41:58.826
in my restaurant in Las Vegas.

41:58.930 --> 42:00.552
But after his
performance tonight,

42:00.656 --> 42:03.728
I could not let him in, notby the hair on my chinny chin,

42:03.831 --> 42:04.591
chin.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.391
NARRATOR: Next time
on "Hell's Kitchen"--

42:12.495 --> 42:14.014
You can't taste either.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.533
Balls on this bitch, man.

42:15.636 --> 42:18.363
NARRATOR: --after teasingfrom the women goes too far--

42:18.466 --> 42:19.571
Embarrassed.

42:19.675 --> 42:21.297
NARRATOR: --will moretaunts from his own team--

42:21.400 --> 42:23.057
Trevor just fucked it all up.

42:23.161 --> 42:24.818
[laughs]

42:24.921 --> 42:26.647
NARRATOR: --push
Trevor over the edge?

42:30.133 --> 42:30.927
I'm sick of it.

42:31.031 --> 42:32.032
I really am.

42:32.135 --> 42:34.310
NARRATOR: And on a
special charity night--

42:34.413 --> 42:35.863
Enjoy.
Keep up the good work.

42:35.967 --> 42:36.761
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

42:36.864 --> 42:38.072
Thank you.

42:38.176 --> 42:40.696
NARRATOR: --will one teamserve up something so foul--

42:40.799 --> 42:41.697
It's so tough.

42:41.800 --> 42:42.594
Oh my gosh.

42:42.698 --> 42:43.699
Ladies, standards!

42:43.802 --> 42:45.045
Oh, no, no.

42:45.148 --> 42:45.977
Ugh.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.703
It looks like a giant scab.

42:47.806 --> 42:50.153
NARRATOR: --it shuts Hell'sKitchen down for good.

42:50.257 --> 42:51.465
This is terrible.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.399
NARRATOR: It's all next weekon an alarming episode--

42:54.502 --> 42:55.538
Oh my god.

42:55.642 --> 42:58.023
NARRATOR: --of "Hell's Kitchen."
