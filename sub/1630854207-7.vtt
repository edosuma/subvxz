09:14.788 --> 09:17.021
No offence, mom and dad.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.591
- Tell 'em about my moonshine.
Tell 'em I'm a...

09:19.593 --> 09:21.993
Chemical engineer.
(all scoff and laugh)

09:24.464 --> 09:26.798
- Listen, I get that gale has

09:26.800 --> 09:29.734
This undeniable magnetism,
and those eyes,

09:29.770 --> 09:32.169
So stormy blue with just
a hint of green-grey,

09:32.205 --> 09:34.539
But you're gonna have to nip
this whole midlife crisis

09:34.674 --> 09:36.874
In the bud. Pronto.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.910
Mainly because we can't
afford bail.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.412
- Okay, so you got to stop
weighing in on my choices

09:41.481 --> 09:42.981
When our marriage ended.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.416
But in this case,
I agree with you.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.419
By sundown, my outlaw
biker fling

09:48.455 --> 09:50.155
Will be nothing but a memory.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.558
Memory I will think of often
in... More private times.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.027
- Okay. Well, I hope
your breakup skills

09:56.096 --> 09:58.229
Have improved since
you dumped me.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.231
Publicly. Loudly.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.066
Under a pirate chuppah.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.968
- I hope so, too.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.971
And I'm sorry.
- Nah, I deserved it.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.340
Just do me a favour,
let gale down gently

10:09.343 --> 10:11.242
Because losing you...

10:11.311 --> 10:13.077
Really sucks.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.213
And he's got a gun.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.883
(slurps coffee)

10:18.885 --> 10:22.053
- Ryan, maybe you should give
yourself some time to process.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.155
I've had 22 years.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.057
You've had 22 minutes.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.758
- No, this isn't about me.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.594
Sammy's been looking for you.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.462
Wondering about you
his whole life.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.230
He thought you were dead!
This is a good thing.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.333
- I just think we need
to be gentle here.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.769
- Nobody knows this family
better than me.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.271
And would you rather just
rando run into sammy?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.273
Then what?
- Just wait!

10:42.275 --> 10:44.242
Ryan, wait, just, just--

10:44.377 --> 10:46.477
Oh, I don't think we
should do this right now.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.617
(door clicks closed)

10:52.752 --> 10:53.885
- (nervous exhale)

10:53.954 --> 10:56.154
Sammy.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.355
Uh, look at you.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.157
Oh, my god.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.395
- What's...What's going on?

11:04.398 --> 11:06.130
- Sammy, everyone,

11:07.233 --> 11:09.367
I'd like to introduce
you to someone...

11:09.369 --> 11:11.202
Special to me.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.004
An old friend of mine,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.906
Ani.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.975
She worked one summer at
the fish and chips shack,

11:16.977 --> 11:19.310
And we kinda fell in love.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.045
We had our first boning
session on the beach--

11:21.081 --> 11:23.181
- Ryan, I don't think--
- ani...

11:24.918 --> 11:27.218
Everyone, drumroll, please!

11:28.388 --> 11:30.221
Seriously, you're gonna
want a drumroll.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.989
- What's happening here?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.092
- Sammy,
- no.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.027
- ...We found her.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.596
Ani is your bio mom.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.137
And we've got somethin' else
to tell you.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.274
- Spit it out, son.
- It's me!

11:50.343 --> 11:52.810
I'm sammy's bio dad!

11:52.812 --> 11:54.545
And I've been here,
all along!

11:56.316 --> 11:58.816
- Ho-ly shit.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.019
- So, that means, lidia,
nora, rhian,

12:01.154 --> 12:02.887
They're all your aunts.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.756
Dad's your grandpa,
mom's your grandma,

12:04.758 --> 12:06.557
Eleanor and finn are your--
- hi. Um...

12:06.593 --> 12:09.426
This isn't exactly the way I
wanted to have this go down,

12:09.463 --> 12:11.963
But I am so glad to meet you.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.601
(waves lap in distance)

12:21.074 --> 12:22.941
(distant playful chatter
and laughter)

12:28.115 --> 12:29.814
(footsteps thud)

12:32.953 --> 12:34.752
Bea: Sammy!

12:40.193 --> 12:41.793
(door clunks open)

12:41.795 --> 12:44.262
- Get ready for your minds
to be blown, people.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.064
I am having twins!

12:47.134 --> 12:49.100
Woo!

12:49.102 --> 12:51.235
Twins! Ha, ha!

12:52.739 --> 12:53.871
<i> Two babies.</i>

12:57.944 --> 13:00.411
♪♪♪

13:00.480 --> 13:03.181
(light knock,
door creaks open)

13:08.421 --> 13:10.989
- Can we talk?

13:11.124 --> 13:12.890
- Oh, honey.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.492
We love you so--
- no, mom, don't.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.529
Just don't, okay.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.399
We all know how this is
gonna go, so,

13:21.468 --> 13:22.933
Why don't I just...

13:24.037 --> 13:26.370
(sighs) save everyone
the trouble.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.840
- Okay.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.711
How's it gonna go?

13:33.847 --> 13:35.980
- You usually walk in here

13:36.016 --> 13:38.183
And you say comforting things

13:39.519 --> 13:41.251
To duct-tape over the problem.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.586
And then,
if that doesn't work,

13:42.622 --> 13:44.589
I talk to lidia.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.525
If lidia's not busy
stealing trucks.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.827
And if she is busy
stealing trucks,

13:49.830 --> 13:51.762
I'm sure rhian
will threaten ryan

13:51.798 --> 13:53.564
Until he apologizes

13:53.567 --> 13:55.133
For the absolute grenade
that he just dropped.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.235
And then, shit really goes
south, and then, from there,

13:57.370 --> 13:59.237
I go to nora, who will
only make me see

13:59.372 --> 14:02.473
That the absurdity
of the situation is just...

14:02.509 --> 14:04.675
Is just something that
just can't be fixed.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.277
- You're good.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.279
- Very good.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.147
- Oh, god.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.283
- We're gonna leave you alone.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.154
We just wanted to see
if you needed us.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.955
- Yeah, I do, I have um,

14:18.024 --> 14:19.857
I have one question.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.160
How is it possible

14:23.230 --> 14:26.697
That nobody noticed a black,
teenage girl

14:26.766 --> 14:29.167
Working here for an entire
summer,

14:29.169 --> 14:31.502
And-and ryan,
who had sex with everybody,

14:31.571 --> 14:34.072
Found me, I don't know,
what, nine months later?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.840
- Hun, we had...

14:35.909 --> 14:38.042
Hundreds of part-time employees
over the years.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.677
- Oh, please.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.113
- We may not have been
as attentive

14:42.182 --> 14:43.847
As-as we could've been.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.616
I know that, and it's not an
excuse.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.318
- Yeah. We are so sorry.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.520
We can only imagine
how you feel.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.022
- No! You can't!

14:51.157 --> 14:53.057
Because the brother that
I've been taking care of

14:53.059 --> 14:54.692
Since I could talk,

14:54.728 --> 14:56.461
Is, is my biological father!

14:56.463 --> 14:58.595
And...Her!

14:58.632 --> 15:00.464
She knew where I was
the entire time.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.466
And she just like,
never came looking?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.006
I changed my mind.
I changed my mind.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.873
I wish I never found her.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.542
Just, just tell her to go.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.744
<i> Just tell her to go!</i>

15:20.487 --> 15:22.820
- Congratulations.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.221
(footsteps recede)

15:25.558 --> 15:27.825
(door clicks open, shuts)

15:31.764 --> 15:33.130
- Was that...

15:33.166 --> 15:34.798
- Yep.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.768
(waves lap)

15:37.804 --> 15:39.536
(bottle clangs,
alcohol burbles)

15:41.708 --> 15:44.441
Kid had a point.
(accepting sigh)

15:44.477 --> 15:47.211
How did we miss putting those
puzzle pieces together?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.447
- We looked for that girl.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.415
We tried.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.450
- Not hard enough, I guess.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.652
Maybe it was selfish.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.588
You know, some part of us
not wanting

15:57.624 --> 15:59.190
Sammy's real mother
to be found.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.091
- It wasn't selfish.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.060
We had five kids
and this place.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.095
We were overwhelmed.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.100
So... It takes a massive
family crisis

16:11.137 --> 16:12.936
For us to get talking again.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.072
- I've been around.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.542
You've been busy.
- Yes.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.011
Davide and I are trying
to put on a show.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.680
- I'd like to put his teeny,
tiny face in a bench vice.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.515
- He's not the problem here.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.284
- Things were just dandy
before he showed up.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.686
- No, it wasn't.
You've half-assed everything

16:28.821 --> 16:30.488
I've wanted to do
since retiring.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.624
- Seems the only thing
you want to do, is davide.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.359
- Is it so wrong,

16:35.395 --> 16:37.428
For me to want to have a man
look at me again,

16:37.464 --> 16:39.963
And not fall asleep?
- I look at you all the time.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.832
I'm lookin' at you right now.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.168
- You might look at me,
but you don't see me, ken.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.437
- I'm playin' a goddamn
tentacle, for god's sake.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.605
I don't know what more
you want from me.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.340
- Forget it.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.443
(footsteps crunch away)

16:52.479 --> 16:54.011
- (frustrated sigh)

16:54.014 --> 16:55.446
(trunk slams)

16:55.482 --> 16:57.248
Ryan: Ani! Ani! Ani! Ani! Ani!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

16:57.250 --> 16:59.349
- That could not
have gone any worse.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.519
- When I rehearsed it
in my head, it was a beautiful,

17:01.588 --> 17:03.254
Poignant reunion, I swear.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.156
(door shuts)

17:05.291 --> 17:07.491
Let me fix this.
Please?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.728
- It's not all on you.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.597
I agreed, so it's on me.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.565
I didn't know the right thing
to do then,

17:14.700 --> 17:17.201
And I sure don't now.
- We can make this better.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.470
- No, you guys have
some things to work out.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.473
And sammy clearly wants
nothing to do with me, so,

17:22.509 --> 17:24.942
I should just go.
- You can't leave.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.879
Promise rock decrees it.
- Excuse me?

17:28.915 --> 17:31.315
- Remember the rocks
we painted that summer?

17:31.317 --> 17:33.217
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.552
- We swore that if one of us
ever needed anything,

17:35.588 --> 17:37.221
Really bad,

17:37.223 --> 17:39.156
All one person had to do
was present that rock,

17:39.225 --> 17:41.192
And then, the other person
had to do it.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.227
One time only.
No questions asked.

17:43.263 --> 17:46.097
This rock says "kelsey".

17:46.232 --> 17:47.965
- Ha, ha!

17:48.101 --> 17:50.968
In the spirit
of the promise rock,

17:51.104 --> 17:52.736
Give me one hour.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.173
Please, just meet me for a
paddle boat like we used to.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.309
- That wasn't me either, ryan.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.712
(sighs)
okay, that was me.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.214
- Ha, ha.

18:03.349 --> 18:05.383
- Fine. One hour.
- That's all I need.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.319
At the marina. Okay?

18:11.057 --> 18:12.790
(cars whoosh by)

18:12.925 --> 18:15.393
- The last few weeks
have been amazing

18:15.528 --> 18:18.529
But I-I just feel like
I need some space.

18:18.664 --> 18:19.930
(door closes)

18:19.966 --> 18:21.332
Like, a lot of space.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.734
I-I feel like I need
to focus on myself.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.338
- Honey, just rip off
the bandage.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.207
(coffee burbles)
- hmm.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.877
(gentle tap on glass)
- (nervous) oh, hi.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.712
(bell jingles)

18:36.783 --> 18:38.949
(lidia giggles nervously)
hey.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.951
(leather crinkles)

18:40.987 --> 18:42.687
- Hi.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.688
Alison. I'm starvin'.
What's good here?

18:44.757 --> 18:46.690
- Everything.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.426
- All right,
I'll have the burger,

18:48.428 --> 18:49.360
Side salad instead of fries

18:49.429 --> 18:51.362
And a iced tea,

18:51.364 --> 18:53.263
Unsweetened. Please.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.734
So, (clears throat)
- oh?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.904
- About this morning.
- Hmm. Right, yeah.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.906
Just a lot of family stuff.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.775
Turns out my brother
is actually my nephew.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.611
And... It's a very long story.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.147
Uh.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.051
About you coming to my parents'
play tonight,

19:14.120 --> 19:16.020
- Uh, is that what
this is about?

19:16.022 --> 19:18.122
You're nervous about
the first official

40:38.870 --> 40:41.504

40:41.506 --> 40:42.906

40:42.908 --> 40:45.074

40:45.143 --> 40:46.976
We're moving!

40:49.915 --> 40:52.114

I hope we are.

There's a, there's
a garage around back

41:00.158 --> 41:01.691
That I was thinking we could

41:01.760 --> 41:03.760
Convert into a studio,

41:03.762 --> 41:05.661
If you wanted to work remotely.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.232
We can finally
have our own place.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.770
A home.

Good, good, good.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.112
I'll get going on
that garage right away.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.115
I'll put up some
soundproofing. Uh--

41:26.184 --> 41:27.917
- No, terry.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.919

that baby corn

Is legit a baby corn, but baby
carrots are just adult carrots
