WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.469 --> 00:13.221
[grunts]

00:16.599 --> 00:18.810
So, my loves, are you warmed up?

00:19.394 --> 00:20.270
Let's do this!

00:22.230 --> 00:23.148
It's on!

00:23.481 --> 00:24.899
The fight is hard, I know.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.443
But you're strong.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.902
I believe in you.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.534
-What if I don't want to go?
-[Samantha] Couples sell.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.078
This is what we agreed on.
Zip me up, please.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.997
I don't want to make appearances yet.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.498
Jeez, just leave me my space.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.751
What space, Dodoi? You don't have one.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.336
You sleep on your ex-wife's couch.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.380
I don't care. I'm not going.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.677
Where are the kids?
They should be arguing by now.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.845
They are arguing.

00:53.928 --> 00:54.888
It's a silent war.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.474
Whoever speaks first
has to give you their room.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.269
See, Dodoi? Everyone makes
sacrifices for the family in this house.

01:01.352 --> 01:05.857
[screaming] No!

01:05.940 --> 01:09.360
-It's not fair!
-Life isn't fair, my dear.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.320
Why always me?

01:10.403 --> 01:13.656
So, my loves, it's settled, right?
Dodoi stays in Brandon's room

01:13.740 --> 01:16.576
and Brandon sleeps in Cindy's.
Are you guys ready?

01:16.659 --> 01:18.953
In my room? Brandon fits in the pantry!

01:19.037 --> 01:21.039
Brandon, what if we shared the room?

01:21.122 --> 01:23.833
Spend more time together,
I'll teach you to play soccer.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.128
You're so old, you probably don't know
how to play soccer anymore.

01:28.004 --> 01:31.382
Oh, Dad, don't mind Brandon.
When he's angry, he speaks the truth.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.968
Hey, Cindy!

01:34.385 --> 01:37.180
Do you know PelÃ©? Or Maradona?

01:37.263 --> 01:41.142
-Dodoi here is better than both of them!
-[Cindy] <i>Madonna doesn't play soccer!</i>

01:42.310 --> 01:44.395
You're not ready, Dodoi.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.606
Samantha, it's a cheap beer commercial.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.566
It's a one-way ticket to prime time!

01:48.650 --> 01:51.778
-Who wants to be on prime time?
-Where do you want to be?

01:51.861 --> 01:55.240
Use the opportunity to show the kids
you can do something in life.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.616
I can do plenty of stuff!

01:56.699 --> 01:58.326
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.164
-[Brandon] The studio's here, Mom?
-[Samantha] Son, let me focus.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.626
Are you nervous?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.169
Nervous, Dodoi?

02:08.252 --> 02:12.090
I practically invented the formula:
"Young woman sells beer."

02:13.633 --> 02:16.219
Every kid wants happy parents!

02:16.302 --> 02:18.179
To put a smile on daddy's face

02:18.263 --> 02:20.473
and to help mom sleep like a breeze,

02:20.557 --> 02:22.934
Canoe Beer!

02:23.017 --> 02:24.811
You were nine years old?

02:24.894 --> 02:27.063
Dodoi, any questions, talk to me, OK?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.731
I was raised in a place like this.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.151
If they leave me alone,
everything will be cool.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.656
It's huge!

02:44.664 --> 02:47.041
This is where they shot <i>Frozen</i>, you know?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.419
[Brandon] You're lying!
<i>Frozen </i> is in the snow!

02:49.502 --> 02:51.546
You're saying that
to make me look childish.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.798
-Mom, is it true they--
-One second.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.966
Just a second, dear.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.134
[inhales deeply]

02:56.217 --> 02:59.596
-Our biggest star!
-Oh, stop.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.557
Dodoi! A meteor
unleashed through space!

03:02.640 --> 03:03.808
What? I'm not all that.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.312
A star of the field!
A deity of the night, of the party,

03:07.395 --> 03:08.479
of Fausto himself!

03:08.563 --> 03:11.691
I do know Fausto,
but we're not so close like that.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.651
Listen, is this going to take long?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.778
Make yourself comfortable,
we shoot in five.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.072
I saw your commercial on Saturn!

03:18.156 --> 03:20.575
It was amazing! Very good!

03:20.658 --> 03:23.578
What about that play
during the 2004 final?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.915
[director] You dribbled past four players,
gave a diagonal backflip,

03:26.998 --> 03:29.334
-and kicked...
-The Scorpion Kick.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.211
Yeah! You sent the goalkeeper
to the hospital.

03:32.295 --> 03:36.716
Girl, you must be very proud
to be his daughter.

03:36.799 --> 03:37.842
-Let me see.
-Of course!

03:39.677 --> 03:40.929
Who's this, Dad?

03:41.804 --> 03:44.682
-You still know how to fly, champ?
-It's like riding a bike.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.352
Where's the script?
I want to study my character.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.187
This one's cute, isn't she?

03:49.270 --> 03:50.605
-Are you hungry?
-Sorry?

03:50.688 --> 03:54.192
Take them to the dressing room,
give her a sandwich and a magazine, OK?

03:54.275 --> 03:56.236
Come on, champ. Come with me.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.029
[director hums]

03:58.112 --> 04:00.281
-[woman] Dodoi, Dodoi!
-[Samantha sighs]

04:00.365 --> 04:01.783
-You're Dodoi's wife?
-Samantha.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.534
-You're late.
-No, you're late.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.703
-I've been waiting for hours.
-I'm never late.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.164
-[woman] Want makeup on or not?
-Makeup.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.875
Great. Go to the dressing room.
Are you the daughter?

04:10.959 --> 04:11.876
Yes, I'm Cindy.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.211
-How old?
-Eleven.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.089
That's not my problem.
Stay with the agency staff, OK?

04:16.172 --> 04:19.259
-How old are you?
-Eight. But I have an old soul.

04:19.341 --> 04:22.220
How cute!
Makes me want to bite you,

04:22.303 --> 04:24.430
rip off your cheeks and kill you!

04:25.098 --> 04:26.724
[woman] He's coming with me, OK?

04:26.808 --> 04:29.060
Auntie is going to eat you alive.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:45.785 --> 04:46.995
[Samantha] Good morning!

04:47.078 --> 04:49.247
"Good morning"?
You trying to make friends?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.040
You can talk behind my back.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.667
It's OK, I'm bulletproof.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.340
[woman] I've always heard
that a creaking door hangs longer!

04:59.424 --> 05:00.633
And it seems...

05:01.718 --> 05:02.969
they don't grow older!

05:03.052 --> 05:04.178
Norminha!

05:04.262 --> 05:05.722
[shrieking]

05:05.805 --> 05:08.391
My God, you haven't aged at all!

05:08.474 --> 05:10.310
You're just a sweetheart.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.438
No, I'm not. You do look the same!

05:13.521 --> 05:17.191
The last time I saw you
you were ten years old!

05:17.275 --> 05:19.235
-Remember that?
-Sure!

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
And you set my wig on fire!

05:21.904 --> 05:24.615
-Kids' stuff.
-The wig was on my head.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.909
[laughing]

05:26.993 --> 05:28.661
Don't join her team, Norminha.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.122
She's late and wants to take my spot.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.875
[Dodoi] <i>Let's go over this again.</i>

05:33.958 --> 05:36.294
-I go to the right and run to the goal?
-Dodoi.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.464
Imagine you're a wild panther,

05:39.547 --> 05:42.133
feeling the smell of burned malt
in the savannah,

05:42.216 --> 05:45.428
the deep scents of coffee and chocolate.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.846
It's a dark beer.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.309
Chase the ball
as if you were chasing your life.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.351
The field...

05:53.061 --> 05:55.021
reflects your soul...

05:55.104 --> 05:56.898
-...like Narcissus.
-[bell rings]

05:56.981 --> 05:58.357
-You know?
-Go left.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.276
-Laura, get out.
-Fine.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.279
Let me see. OK.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.822
[producer] Good.

06:05.948 --> 06:07.200
Dodoi, focus!

06:07.283 --> 06:10.620
-I can't understand why they need her!
-[Norminha] I've know her since...

06:11.037 --> 06:11.871
Hey, girls.

06:11.954 --> 06:13.414
[Jessica, quietly] Shh.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.500
No one has the script?

06:15.583 --> 06:16.959
Do you see this woman?

06:17.043 --> 06:20.630
-It's an honor to act alongside her.
-[Jessica] You think I want to show off?

06:20.713 --> 06:22.673
-No one knows her!
-Samantha!

06:22.757 --> 06:25.384
-Hey!
-What an honor to see you here!

06:25.468 --> 06:27.470
Thank you!

06:27.553 --> 06:31.224
I'm right next door as a guest
on an 80's-themed talent show!

06:31.307 --> 06:32.475
[woman] It's so you!

06:32.558 --> 06:35.686
How great! I love talent shows!

06:35.770 --> 06:38.147
I'd love to participate but I'm so busy,

06:38.231 --> 06:40.775
though we always find a way, right?

06:40.858 --> 06:43.111
I'm here recording this amazing project.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.237
Foreign director.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.864
A commercial. If you want to stop by,
no one will mind.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.366
She just said she can't!

06:48.449 --> 06:50.243
She's on set, right?

06:50.326 --> 06:53.538
She only stopped because of me.
How lovely!

06:53.621 --> 06:57.041
It's a super cheesy show, tacky,
forgotten celebrities, no pay.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.503
If I knew you were alive,
I'd have called you.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.963
[woman laughs]

07:02.046 --> 07:06.008
[children laughing and screaming]

07:09.262 --> 07:10.096
Miss!

07:10.513 --> 07:11.681
Miss!

07:12.765 --> 07:14.100
I want to talk to my mom!

07:14.517 --> 07:16.602
I have the right to a visit!

07:16.686 --> 07:19.355
Your mom is filming soon.
Play with your little friends.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.274
But...

07:22.650 --> 07:23.484
Dodoi...

07:24.152 --> 07:25.736
you have to allow yourself.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.156
[director] You're much more than an idea.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.282
You are...

07:29.365 --> 07:31.701
You are a collective feeling.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.870
[director, singing] Dodoi, Dodoi...

07:33.953 --> 07:36.080
Dodoi, Dodoi...

07:36.164 --> 07:38.749
[director, singing] Dodoi, Dodoi...

07:38.833 --> 07:40.084
[assistant] Got it?

07:40.168 --> 07:43.254
Go left, dribble past the first player,
do some kick-ups...

07:43.337 --> 07:46.424
-...stare at the goalkeeper and lob him.
-Do a bicycle kick.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.554
Nice. I dribble past the player,

07:51.637 --> 07:53.306
get the ball and score.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.142
And you want me to do it
with eyes closed or open?

07:56.225 --> 07:59.020
-[director] You choose, but do it well!
-Where's the player?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.855
-Marcao?
-Hey...

08:01.814 --> 08:02.648
I'm here!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.775
-[assistant] Let's go.
-[director] Come on!

08:05.359 --> 08:08.112
[Samantha] After the goal,
he blows a kiss to the fans.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.114
-[Samantha] And the "hot girl"...
-Here!

08:10.198 --> 08:11.908
...holds a cold beer for him.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.493
He sits down, all sweaty,

08:13.576 --> 08:15.620
staring at the girl pouring him the drink.

08:15.703 --> 08:18.247
He says: "Once a champion,
always a champion,"

08:18.331 --> 08:19.832
and drinks the beer.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.793
Then: "Enjoy responsibly,
careful with the missus."

08:22.877 --> 08:25.630
The missus appears
and throws a sandal at him.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.758
-[Jessica giggles]
-There's something wrong here.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.635
There's always something wrong!

08:30.718 --> 08:33.136
-I'm not one of the players, am I?
-No.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.347
Jessica is the girl from the bar, right?

08:35.847 --> 08:36.807
Right.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.934
So... I'm not in the commercial.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.144
Of course you are.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.230
No, there's no role for me.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.149
[Norminha] Of course there is.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.526
My God...

08:47.527 --> 08:49.195
I look like a mother of two!

08:49.278 --> 08:51.155
That's tough, girl.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.616
Hey, miss!

08:54.116 --> 08:55.618
I shouldn't be here!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.787
[sarcastically] Aww! Are you pouting?

08:57.870 --> 09:01.541
Huh? Someone hand me some scissors
so I can cut this little pout off!

09:01.624 --> 09:03.626
I want my mom, or a lawyer!

09:03.709 --> 09:07.505
Listen, boy, this set ends at four
whether you like it or not, OK?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.423
The last kid to mess it up was Giovana.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.259
-Who is Giovana?
-Exactly.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.013
Bro, let me tell you,
there's nothing personal about this.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.265
It's all professional.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.644
You don't remember me, bro?

09:22.228 --> 09:25.398
The booze erased everything?
Me, you, Juninho, erotic sushi,

09:25.481 --> 09:26.941
an anteater drowned in the pool.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.820
-Don't you remember?
-What? Are you crazy?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.905
You really forgot that night.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.615
You were arrested for 12 years...

09:35.283 --> 09:36.951
while we were at the after-party.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.329
[assistant] Shall we start? Silence!

09:40.955 --> 09:44.542
Let's do it, Dodoi! I want truth!
I want emotion!

09:45.251 --> 09:47.003
Scene three, take one.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.004
Action!

09:52.842 --> 09:54.510
-[Dodoi grunts]
-[assistant] Cut!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.304
-[assistant] Any good?
-It was a foul!

09:56.387 --> 09:57.638
-[assistant] Good?
-No.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.348
Did you remember?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.350
-[Dodoi] Referee!
-Silence, please.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.602
Let's do another one.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.854
[male crew] Silence, please!

10:06.606 --> 10:07.732
[assistant] Nuh-uh.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.358
No way!

10:11.027 --> 10:12.486
Come on! One more!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.614
[director sighs]

10:15.489 --> 10:17.199
He'll kill dad.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.619
Dodoi's time has passed.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.413
Lucky for you I only beat people
my own size.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.123
Who are you, ma'am? His grandma?

10:24.206 --> 10:28.294
[scoffs] I'm an actress, OK?
It took hours to make me look like this.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.421
Looks like it took centuries.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.132
I can still send you
to the playground with your brother.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.300
[Cindy] Pssh!

10:34.383 --> 10:35.384
Action!

10:36.177 --> 10:37.219
[Dodoi grunts]

10:37.303 --> 10:40.848
Don't you think this commercial
is too 90s?

10:40.931 --> 10:43.351
-The "hot girl"...
-Jessica!

10:43.768 --> 10:47.188
...serves the beer
while the jealous wife throws the sandal.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.314
[Dodoi grunts]

10:48.397 --> 10:49.523
[assistant] Cut!

10:49.607 --> 10:51.567
-[director] One more.
-Foul, referee!

10:51.651 --> 10:52.818
Cindy...

10:53.152 --> 10:55.071
[quietly] Please, no speeches, all right?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.281
I'm already dealing with that lunatic.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.326
Can you believe
that I've been humble to her

11:00.409 --> 11:01.827
and she was so stupid!

11:01.911 --> 11:05.456
But understand that a woman's
aggressiveness towards another woman--

11:05.539 --> 11:08.167
Daughter, I have no patience
for this stuff right now.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.960
Give mom a break, please?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.921
It's the projection of her anger

11:12.004 --> 11:13.964
against the patriarchal society

11:14.048 --> 11:16.300
that hypersexualizes her image.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.510
[Dodoi groans]

11:20.763 --> 11:21.764
[director] Action!

11:21.847 --> 11:23.265
Hold on, repeat that.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.894
-Jessica isn't happy with what she does.
-[Dodoi grunts]

11:28.562 --> 11:30.022
Genius!

11:30.439 --> 11:33.692
I don't know where you learn these things,

11:33.984 --> 11:35.736
but it makes total sense.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.989
-It's called feminism.
-OK.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.283
Norminha, can you help me put this on...

11:41.826 --> 11:44.161
What are you laughing at?
I know you want my role.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.957
-I'm not laughing at anything.
-Norminha told me what your deal is.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.375
My deal?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.508
[boy, singing] <i>Its velocity was</i>

11:57.925 --> 11:59.844
<i>Impressive</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:01.470
<i>Buzzing</i>

12:01.720 --> 12:03.264
<i>Lightening</i>

12:03.347 --> 12:04.682
<i>Oh yeah</i>

12:04.765 --> 12:07.101
-Did you take singing classes?
-No.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.478
No? You sing so well.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.397
It's like you were born ready.

12:15.192 --> 12:18.154
Please! I'm scared! I'm alone in here!

12:18.237 --> 12:20.781
Don't leave me here alone, I beg you!

12:20.865 --> 12:22.783
It's nothing personal, OK?

12:22.867 --> 12:24.827
It's just that my place is on TV

12:24.910 --> 12:27.163
and yours is somewhere else.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.166
[boy] <i>Please! Don't leave me alone!</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:32.251
[boy, crying] <i>I'm begging! Please!</i>

12:34.962 --> 12:38.215
Jessica, it's all gossip!
Aren't there rumors about you too?

12:38.299 --> 12:40.885
-That I'm a slut or that I raise hell?
-Exactly.

12:40.968 --> 12:44.889
People love to say things behind the back
of successful women like us.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.516
But I really did break
that old lady's nose.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.769
I am sure she deserved it!

12:50.853 --> 12:52.438
Beautiful words, Samantha.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.898
I've got goosebumps.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.028
I never said anything bad about you, sis.
Don't believe what people say.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.321
I'm tired, Jessica.

13:00.404 --> 13:04.200
Tired of this business
of putting women against each other.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.036
This commercial, for example,
is so 90s, isn't it?

13:07.661 --> 13:08.496
Do you think?

13:09.663 --> 13:12.041
Pay attention to how
they've been treating us.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.878
The ball is inside you. Very good.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.131
Yes, give in. Give it all in.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.717
[director] That's my hero.
Smell the scent of the ball.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.177
Let's go, champ!

13:23.260 --> 13:25.888
-Let's go!
-Are you crazy, man?

13:25.971 --> 13:28.516
-I'll beat the shit out of you, son of a--
-Yes!

13:28.599 --> 13:30.100
Yes, you're alive!

13:30.184 --> 13:33.521
This energy, very good!
You're a phoenix out of control!

13:33.604 --> 13:36.106
-Very good, champ!
-[Dodoi] Are you crazy?

13:36.190 --> 13:38.192
Yes! Let's shoot it! Let's start!

13:38.275 --> 13:39.485
[director] Come on!

13:45.199 --> 13:46.534
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:46.617 --> 13:50.079
We're playing "north wing, south wing".
Which side do you choose?

13:50.162 --> 13:51.163
I don't play.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.667
But if you aren't from any wing,
who's going to protect you?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.753
[boy] No, let me go! Stop!

13:57.836 --> 14:00.714
-[boys, laughing]
-Enough, let me go!

14:01.090 --> 14:03.676
I'm Lucas, leader of the south wing.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.930
My character doesn't have a name.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.891
"Hot girl." But what does
the "hot girl" want or need?

14:10.975 --> 14:12.893
Why is she in a bar wearing a swimsuit?

14:12.977 --> 14:14.728
I never play intellectual roles.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.106
I really understand you, Jessica.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.441
I mean, I refused the role myself.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.570
I'm tired of getting roles
with names like "Curvy" or "Bitch".

14:22.653 --> 14:24.154
Exactly, Jessica.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.615
You have to follow your own path,
you know?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.742
And you've chosen to do that?

14:28.826 --> 14:31.912
I'm challenging myself as an actress.
I want to ask you a question...

14:31.996 --> 14:34.081
-Mm-hmm.
-Is this who you are?

14:34.164 --> 14:37.918
I'm much more. I've even taken ayahuasca.
I know my destiny.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.505
And will you let them
steal your destiny from you?

14:42.214 --> 14:45.009
I was suspecting that someone
wanted to take what's mine.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.468
You know that I'm hyperaware?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.470
Follow your own destiny.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.556
I don't want to use my body
to be successful.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.727
I will use my voice
and the body of a puppet.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.980
I want to be a ventriloquist!

15:01.525 --> 15:03.235
[laughing] What a loony, folks.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.196
[chuckles]

15:13.829 --> 15:15.748
[groaning]

15:18.167 --> 15:20.753
OK. Come on! Once more!

15:34.058 --> 15:36.936
[Dodoi breathes heavily]

15:41.482 --> 15:44.443
I think I recognize you.
Aren't you Mrs. Ana's son?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.154
Skinny Mark?

15:47.696 --> 15:48.989
Eh?

15:49.073 --> 15:52.952
You wanted to be a soccer player but
ended up as an extra on a beer commercial.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.745
No idea what you're talking about.

15:54.828 --> 15:55.913
You don't?

15:55.996 --> 15:59.083
[singing] <i>"Skinny Marky...</i>

15:59.166 --> 16:02.169
<i>The skinny boy with tits"</i>
[laughing]

16:02.461 --> 16:04.421
Did that refresh your memory?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.048
I had estrogen issues.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.883
[mocking] "I had estrogen issues."

16:07.967 --> 16:09.843
And that deep voice?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.470
Hey, Dodoi, focus!

16:11.553 --> 16:14.223
Scene three, take 26.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.140
Such a big boy!

16:15.224 --> 16:17.351
-[assistant] Let's start. Ready?
-I am.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.145
And your tits? Are they ready?

16:20.229 --> 16:21.522
Tits!

16:22.189 --> 16:23.524
[director] Come on!

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
[director] Action.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.746
-[Cindy] Goal!
-Cut!

16:37.830 --> 16:39.081
[Dodoi laughs]

16:39.164 --> 16:40.624
Marvelous! Sensational.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.167
[director] Good one, guys!

16:43.335 --> 16:44.378
Good one, Dad!

16:44.461 --> 16:46.213
Let's prepare the next scene.

16:46.296 --> 16:49.842
Someone from the south wing
is leaking information to the north wing.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.385
It wasn't me. I swear!

16:51.468 --> 16:54.096
We saw you chit-chatting
with a boy from the other wing.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.014
He's my brother.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.308
Doesn't matter, you betrayed us.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.852
We're going to kill you.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.854
I can't die. My mom would get angry.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.981
You know we're just playing, right?

17:06.316 --> 17:09.278
We can stay here fighting.
But what about the outside world?

17:09.361 --> 17:12.489
It'd be better to combine our forces
so we can get out of here!

17:14.825 --> 17:16.242
[Dodoi groans]

17:17.118 --> 17:19.954
Did losing that goal
scare you to death?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.540
[director] So, Dodoi...

17:21.915 --> 17:24.209
That's exactly what
I want to talk to you about.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.047
Sometimes the truth
can't handle the whole truth.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.633
And so a lie is necessary
to express the entire truth.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.343
-Do you understand?
-No.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.638
Marcao is your stunt double
for the rest of the scene.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.307
We'll cut his head, put yours on. What do you mean, cut my head?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.560
He scored a beautiful goal!

17:41.643 --> 17:43.187
After trying over 50 times!

17:43.270 --> 17:44.772
-Calm down.
-Don't "calm down" me.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.107
If you want, shoot me,
but don't ruin my schedule.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.943
-Please! This scene is difficult.
-[assistant sighs]

17:50.652 --> 17:53.697
Dodoi, you have to understand that...

17:53.781 --> 17:56.575
the Dodoi of our dreams
is no longer the Dodoi that's here.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.869
You're not 20 years old anymore.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.663
But no one needs to know.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.540
But I will know.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.751
-My kids will know.
-Dad, agree to the double.

18:05.834 --> 18:06.960
Listen to your daughter.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.717
I don't need it. I'm doing it myself.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.888
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.849
Let's do it quick.
In five minutes, we start the bar scene.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.519
[assistant] If you're not ready,
don't come back!

18:23.602 --> 18:24.520
I don't need it.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.898
[Brandon] I'm eight years old.
Lucas is ten.

18:27.981 --> 18:31.318
If we add the age of everyone here,
we're over 100 years old.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.988
At home, Marola is free all day long,
and he's a dog.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.325
Well put.
Not even Marola is locked up like this.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.370
-Who wants to go to the outside world?
-[all] Me!

18:42.246 --> 18:45.082
[fan] Thanks.
I thought he wasn't going to make it.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.919
[director] It comes,
then it goes here like this.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.463
[director] The purpose is... No, no.

18:53.298 --> 18:55.759
Here, quick to her face,
and then we get tighter...

18:56.093 --> 18:58.637
Ah! Ah! The hot girl is running away!

18:59.429 --> 19:02.224
[Jessica] Talk to the hand!
Go fuck yourselves!

19:04.935 --> 19:08.438
This isn't happening. Calm down.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.243
-[Marcao] Dodoi doesn't deserve you.
-I don't talk to extras.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.873
Hey. I came to save your commercial.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.082
What?

19:28.292 --> 19:29.376
No... no.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.670
No, I'm sorry. It's just...

19:31.753 --> 19:33.881
Without the hot girl,
the scene has no truth.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.925
She was the embodiment of desire,

19:37.009 --> 19:39.178
of the male thirst for iced malt.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.264
The missus... with all due respect,

19:42.347 --> 19:45.225
represents the emasculation
of the domesticated beast.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.894
And what do we need?

19:46.977 --> 19:51.064
Frustration and desire mixed together
to serve our hero, understand?

19:51.148 --> 19:53.066
-OK... Pablo, right?
-Yes.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.112
I thought that frustration and desire
can be two sides

19:57.613 --> 19:59.239
of the same force of creation, no?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.992
Ah! How beautiful.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.911
-[Samantha] Listen...
-I like it.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.330
I'll stand here still.
You do all the actions.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.332
I don't want to make mistakes.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.834
-Dodoi, out.
-You're the worst, Samantha.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.921
-[Samantha] Let's go.
-[director] This is Dodoi's spot.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.548
Yes, I get it. But imagine that I'm Dodoi

20:16.632 --> 20:18.634
just for a moment, so I can understand.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.844
Dearest... the camera, five cm this way.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.262
-[Samantha] Tell me...
-Focus.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.847
You put the glass on the table,

20:23.931 --> 20:25.390
stare at Dodoi...

20:25.474 --> 20:27.851
It's dark in here.
Is that spotlight on, my angel?

20:27.935 --> 20:30.812
No, this dim light is
our incandescent moonlight.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.648
It took us hours to get it right, OK?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.024
You're a poet.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.109
Turn it on, please.

20:36.193 --> 20:40.030
Free your mind.
The best moments are improvised.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.118
We're grown-ups!

20:45.202 --> 20:47.913
[cheering]

20:55.254 --> 20:58.548
[shouting and screaming]

21:07.057 --> 21:10.310
[cheering]

21:15.065 --> 21:17.901
[puffing and panting]

21:19.569 --> 21:21.863
Guys, we're free!

21:22.406 --> 21:24.408
Yeah, but so what, now that we're adults?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.243
Now that we're adults,

21:26.326 --> 21:28.662
we can complain about
gastritis and headaches.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.707
It's boring here.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.711
-Yeah, back to the playground!
-[kids] Yeah, let's go back there!

21:35.794 --> 21:36.920
[Brandon] Guys, no! Huh?

21:39.589 --> 21:40.632
[Brandon sighs]

21:43.760 --> 21:45.137
[Brandon] She did it!

21:51.310 --> 21:55.022
Magnificent! Hurry up,
before time dilutes the truth!

21:57.524 --> 21:59.276
Thanks, guys, it was great!

21:59.359 --> 22:01.570
[assistant] Let's prepare
for the next scene.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.697
[Samantha] Hey.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.619
Cindy, I've changed.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.749
I know what Dodoi's been through.
I was imprisoned too.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.002
He can stay in my room, OK?

22:17.085 --> 22:18.670
Shut up, Brandon. You see, Dodoi?

22:23.884 --> 22:26.219
"Couples sell." Now...

22:26.762 --> 22:28.805
Pssh! Prime time.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.682
[laughing]

22:30.766 --> 22:33.351
You didn't hear?
This thing's only for the internet.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.066
-Samantha?
-What?

22:43.487 --> 22:44.905
What if I play soccer again?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.409
[assistant] Let's go.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.872
Let's go, they're calling us.
Where's my mark? Here?

22:55.582 --> 22:56.792
Action.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.594
Once a champion, always a champion.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.225
[gasps]

23:13.308 --> 23:16.561
Enjoy responsibly,
but careful with the missus.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.979
[laughing]

23:18.563 --> 23:21.566
-Cut!
-[Samantha] Sorry, I just got excited.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.734
[director] Incredible!

23:22.818 --> 23:26.071
Magnificent. So strong, right?
What thirst this woman has!

23:26.154 --> 23:27.864
[director] Impressive. Very good.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.576
No! No, I'm here.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.955
[chuckles] I've found our new judge.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.375
[woman] Samantha! [laughing]

23:39.305 --> 23:45.879
