10:58.658 --> 11:00.794
NO, IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.
IT'S BECAUSE I'M A GIRL. MOM!

11:00.794 --> 11:03.230
CALL HER AGAIN.
THAT DON'T SCARE ME.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.998
MOM!

11:04.998 --> 11:07.634
GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO, GO.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.070
MOM, DAD'S LETTING JASON
GO TO THE BATTING CAGES,

11:10.070 --> 11:12.272
AND HE WON'T LET ME GO
TO MY POETRY SLAM.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.274
WE AGREED
THEY WERE BOTH GROUNDED.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.309
LOOK, ANGIE, JASON'S GOT
A CHANCE TO GO PRO, OKAY?

11:16.309 --> 11:18.311
HE'S GOT SCOUTS THAT ARE
GONNA COME AND SEE HIM.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.580
HIS WHOLE FUTURE DEPENDS
ON HOW PREPARED HE IS.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.282
BUT POETRY
COULD BE MY FUTURE.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.551
LOOK, CARMEN,
POETRY'S NOT A CAREER.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.154
NO ONE EVER GOT
A MILLION-DOLLAR SIGNING BONUS

11:27.154 --> 11:29.256
FOR RHYMING "BINGO"
AND "NAME-O."

11:30.958 --> 11:33.193
SO, BASEBALL'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN POETRY

11:33.193 --> 11:35.595
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN
MAKE MONEY AT IT?

11:35.595 --> 11:37.297
BINGO!
NAME-O!

11:37.297 --> 11:39.299
WELL, POETRY IS
MY PASSION,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.935
AND I'M GONNA MAJOR
IN IT AT COLLEGE,

11:41.935 --> 11:43.937
SO GET USED TO IT.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.206
COLLEGE,
YEAH, RIGHT.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.175
WHAT?
I'M GOING TO COLLEGE.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.310
REALLY? SO I GUESS ALL THOSE
C's ON YOUR REPORT CARD

11:50.310 --> 11:52.579

11:54.915 --> 11:57.217
"DAMN, I WAS ALMOST A 'C.'"

11:57.217 --> 11:59.419
DAD, I WAS
GOING THROUGH STUFF,

11:59.419 --> 12:00.888
BUT I'M TRYING HARDER NOW.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.190
GEORGE, SHE DID TAKE
HER COLLEGE APTITUDE TEST.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.192
THE ONLY REASON
SHE TOOK IT, ANGIE,

12:05.192 --> 12:07.294
IS BECAUSE YOU MADE HER.
LOOK, CARMEN'S NOT MOTIVATED.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.597
ALL SHE CARES ABOUT IS JASON,
HER HAIR, AND HER CLOTHES.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.166
EVEN WHEN YOU HOMESCHOOLED HER,
SHE WAS LATE TO CLASS

12:13.166 --> 12:15.402
BECAUSE SHE SAID THERE WAS
TRAFFIC ON THE STAIRS.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.740
WAIT A SECOND.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
THIS ISN'T ABOUT POETRY

12:22.742 --> 12:24.411
OR ME BEING A GIRL.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.280
THIS IS ABOUT
WHAT DAD THINKS OF ME.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.416
CARMEN,
YOUR FATHER LOVES YOU,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.551
AND HE WANTS
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.220
DAD,

12:33.220 --> 12:35.789
DO YOU BELIEVE
I COULD MAKE IT IN COLLEGE?

12:40.560 --> 12:43.130
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH MY LIFE?

12:43.130 --> 12:46.366
CARMEN, I JUST THINK
YOU NEED TO BE REALISTIC.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.168
REALISTIC?

12:48.168 --> 12:50.670
OH, MY GOD, YOU NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT ME GOING TO COLLEGE

12:50.670 --> 12:52.405
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN ME.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.474
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
YOU GOING TO COLLEGE, CARMEN,

12:54.474 --> 12:57.010
'CAUSE YOU NEVER SHOWED ME
ANY POTENTIAL.

13:02.649 --> 13:06.286
CARMEN,
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.720
HOW COULD YOU?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.522
LOOK, ANGIE,
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE

13:09.522 --> 13:11.291
A BIG FIGHT, ALL RIGHT?
BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.160
I DIDN'T SLEEP
VERY GOOD LAST NIGHT,

13:13.160 --> 13:16.496
AND WHAT I COULD USE RIGHT NOW,
REALLY, IS A POWER NAP.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.767
'CAUSE IF YOU DEFEAT
A TIRED GEORGE,

13:20.767 --> 13:24.004

HOW COULD YOU
TELL OUR DAUGHTER

13:28.741 --> 13:30.878
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY POTENTIAL?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.679
LOOK, CARMEN'S NEVER BEEN
A GREAT STUDENT.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.882
SHE'S NEVER COME TO ME
AND SAID, "DAD, I WANNA BE

13:34.882 --> 13:36.917

OR A DOCTOR."

13:36.917 --> 13:39.252
SHE'S NEVER PURSUED ANYTHING

13:39.252 --> 13:43.756
IN TIGHT JEANS THAT MADE
HIS BUTT LOOK "SO HOT."

13:43.756 --> 13:46.894
WELL, SHE'S PURSUING
POETRY NOW.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.962
AND IF THAT'S GOT HER
EXCITED ABOUT COLLEGE,

13:48.962 --> 13:50.430
THEN WE SHOULD SUPPORT HER.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.632
COME ON, ANGIE, CARMEN'S NOT
COLLEGE MATERIAL.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.568
SHE NEEDS TO WAKE UP
AND SMELL THE COFFEE...

13:55.568 --> 13:57.237
THEN PROBABLY POUR IT
FOR A TRUCKER

13:57.237 --> 13:59.306
AND TELL HIM
ABOUT THE SPECIALS.

I TOOK A LOSE-LOSE,
TURNED IT INTO A WIN-WIN.

TO HELL-HELL.

ABOUT YOUR OWN PROBLEMS?

ABOUT THIS TIME?

HER DOUGHNUT?

14:37.444 --> 14:41.114
NO, WE'RE ARGUING
ABOUT CARMEN GOING TO COLLEGE.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.782
OH, COLLEGE.

14:42.782 --> 14:46.920
THAT'S JUST A PLACE TO GET DRUNK
AND SLEEP WITH STRANGERS.

14:46.920 --> 14:50.290
