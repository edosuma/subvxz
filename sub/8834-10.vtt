This time he's not getting away.

01:27.834 --> 01:28.792
Blast.

01:47.333 --> 01:50.375
I intend to find you
a hiding place, my darling.

01:54.417 --> 01:56.250
Ah! Just the thing.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.041
Trapped.

02:20.875 --> 02:23.959
OK, Covington, hand it over.

02:24.041 --> 02:28.083
And let you cretins waste the wealth
that talisman will bring?

02:28.166 --> 02:31.709
If you don't give us the doll,
we're gonna waste you.

02:31.792 --> 02:35.542
Ahh, sweet deliverance.

02:35.625 --> 02:38.959

when you need them?

02:41.667 --> 02:43.333
[yelling]

02:52.583 --> 02:55.417
Oh, I beg your pardon, officers.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.750
Here you are, risking your lives
to protect our community,

02:58.834 --> 03:01.125
and I damage your motorcar.

03:01.208 --> 03:04.041
I insist that you arrest me
until I make reparations.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.667

03:32.333 --> 03:34.375
would leave an airplane in such a state?

[Kit] Baloo!

03:36.417 --> 03:37.375
Uh-oh.

03:37.458 --> 03:41.959
Papa Bear, Miss Cunningham is
gonna have a surprise inspection.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.458
Huh? What? Inspection?

03:44.542 --> 03:46.667
Yeah, she'll be here any minute.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.750
And you know what she said about,
a clean plane is...

03:49.834 --> 03:53.125
An efficient plane.
I know, I know.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.834
[sighs]
We'd better get moving, Kit boy.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.083
[glass shatters]

04:05.834 --> 04:09.709
Say, how'd you find out
about this inspection, anyway?

04:09.792 --> 04:13.125
Uh, I accidentally read it
on her calendar.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.125
You mean the very private

04:15.208 --> 04:19.250
"Trespassers-will-be-shot" calendar
that she keeps locked in her desk?

04:19.333 --> 04:20.709
That's the one.

04:20.791 --> 04:24.333
[laughing]
I love that boy.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.125
[splash]

04:30.500 --> 04:33.041
Whew. That's the last of it.

04:33.125 --> 04:36.000
Let's get it out of here
before Becky shows up.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.542
[Rebecca] Baloo!

04:37.625 --> 04:39.041
[gasps]
It's her.

04:46.375 --> 04:49.000
Baloo?
Oh, there you are.

04:50.041 --> 04:53.583
I'm seeing it,
and I still don't believe it.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.625
Baloo!

04:55.709 --> 04:59.417
Hello there, Molly.
What's with the getup?

04:59.500 --> 05:02.875
I'm not Molly, I'm Danger Woman,

05:02.959 --> 05:06.792
here to inspect my secret headquarters.

05:06.875 --> 05:11.750
It's the only way I could her away
from that silly radio program.

05:12.125 --> 05:16.959
Hey, what happened
to all your neat garbage?

05:17.834 --> 05:23.083
Baloo, I have to admit that it looks like
you're finally running a shipshape ship.

05:23.166 --> 05:25.417
Why, sure, Rebecca.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.291
Like you always say...

05:28.375 --> 05:31.875
[all]
A clean plane is an efficient plane.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.625
You missed a piece.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.208
Uh, gee.
How did that get there?

05:38.291 --> 05:39.500
Well?

05:40.333 --> 05:41.583
OK.

05:46.041 --> 05:46.959
Got it.

05:47.041 --> 05:49.709
Oh, boy.
This is more like it.

05:49.792 --> 05:54.875
I thought air freight businesses
would be full of adventure and romance.

05:54.959 --> 05:57.667
All I get is clutter and disorder.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.917
Where's the glamour?
Where's the excitement?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.250
Don't worry, Mommy.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.917
There's always glamour and excitement
when Danger Woman's on the job.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.375
Honey, I wouldn't trade you
or Danger Woman for anything.

06:12.792 --> 06:18.250
But what I wouldn't give to meet someone
with charm, with culture...

06:18.333 --> 06:21.000
A real man of the world.

06:21.083 --> 06:26.583
I beg your pardon, but I am looking for
a Miss Rebecca Cunningham.

06:27.041 --> 06:30.375
I... I'm Rebecca Cunningham.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.291
Ah, Rebecca.

06:32.375 --> 06:36.542
A name for royalty,
and it suits you so well, my dear.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.542
My name is Covington.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.750
-Oh, my.
-Oh, brother.

06:44.834 --> 06:49.417
He sounds like the guys Danger Woman's
always beating up.

06:49.500 --> 06:54.083
You must be Baloo,
master of the world famous <i>Sea Duck.</i>

06:54.166 --> 06:56.583
Ah, the tales I've been told.

06:56.667 --> 07:02.041
You have? Well, now, I've been through
a scrape or two or three.

07:02.125 --> 07:05.166
Who is this darling little girl?

07:05.250 --> 07:09.250
And how did she get to be so cute?

07:09.333 --> 07:12.000
-You stay away from my mommy!
-Ow!

07:12.083 --> 07:15.500
Molly! Be nice to Mr. Covington.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.667
He was just trying to say hello.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.208
[Baloo]
Well, I don't know just what you heard

07:19.291 --> 07:20.959
about the <i>Sea Duck, </i> Mr. Covington,

07:21.041 --> 07:24.083
but there's not
a plane in the sky like her.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.542
What's this?

07:26.458 --> 07:28.750
Wow!
A doll!

07:28.875 --> 07:32.834
She'll look a hurricane in the eye
and never blink.

07:37.041 --> 07:40.166
[gasps]
May I see that, my dear?

07:40.709 --> 07:41.959
-No!
-[groans]

07:42.041 --> 07:43.500
Molly!

07:43.583 --> 07:46.458
It's my doll. I found it.

07:46.542 --> 07:49.333
I can have it, can't I, Baloo?

07:49.417 --> 07:50.917
Why, sure, honey.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.709
Oh, Mr. Covington, I don't know
what has gotten into the child.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.917
[chuckles]
It's forgotten.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.792
And please, just call me Covington.

07:59.875 --> 08:05.291
We can't remain so formal
if you and I and your delightful child,

08:05.375 --> 08:10.709
and her little wooden playmate
are to become good friends, can we?

08:10.792 --> 08:14.000
All right... Covington.

09:19.917 --> 09:23.709
[Rebecca] Molly, I want to
talk to you about Mr. Covington.

09:23.792 --> 09:28.000
You do realize that Covington
has become very special to me?

09:28.083 --> 09:33.250
I know, Mommy,
but Cara and Milly think he's creepy.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.750
They want me to be happy, don't they?

09:35.834 --> 09:38.041
For sure, Mommy, but...

09:38.125 --> 09:40.375
[sighs]

09:40.458 --> 09:44.417
They'll try real hard
to like Mr. Covington.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.250
Oh...

09:46.333 --> 09:47.834
Thank you, honey.

09:50.917 --> 09:53.041
But I won't.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.750
Creepy isn't getting you or my mommy.

09:58.875 --> 10:03.166
Where is that
wonderful child of yours tonight?

10:03.250 --> 10:08.041
[giggles] I talked Danger Woman
into spending the evening with her dolls.

10:08.125 --> 10:12.208
Dolls!
Indeed... how sweet.

10:12.291 --> 10:15.500
I should at least say hello
to the little...

10:15.583 --> 10:18.208
-Whoa!
-Covington!

10:18.291 --> 10:21.667
-Are you all right?
-Quite frankly, I don't know.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.917
Here, sit down.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.750
[yells]

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Look, Cara.
His haircut fell off. [laughing]

10:32.750 --> 10:33.875
[Rebecca] Molly!

10:33.959 --> 10:35.500
Uh-oh.

10:35.583 --> 10:37.291
Young lady, we have to talk.

10:40.208 --> 10:44.875
That does it!
I'm going to get that doll tonight!

10:44.959 --> 10:48.500
And I think I know just how to do it.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.834
Molly, what am I going to do with you?

10:52.917 --> 10:53.750
[knocking on door]

10:53.834 --> 10:58.041
My dear! Baloo just called!
There's been a robbery at your offices!

10:58.750 --> 11:01.041
Oh, my goodness.
Covington, I...

11:01.709 --> 11:05.458
You know, Rebecca, you can always
count on me in a crisis.

11:05.542 --> 11:08.917
I shall remain here
and protect your daughter.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.709
Oh, thank you, Covy.
You're an angel.

11:11.792 --> 11:15.542
Mommy, please.
We want to come with you.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.083
No, I've had enough
of your shenanigans tonight.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.959
You'll be safe here with Covington.

11:21.917 --> 11:24.792
Never fear.
I'll have everything well in hand...

11:25.917 --> 11:29.417
as soon as you give me that doll.

11:33.917 --> 11:39.542
Now, are you going to let Covington
see your doll or not?

11:39.625 --> 11:41.125
-Not!
-Ow!

11:42.959 --> 11:46.834
Open up, you little brat,
or I'll break it down!

11:46.917 --> 11:50.291
I'm sorry, Milly,
but Cara has to run away.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.542
You two say goodbye,
while I figure out what to do.

11:53.917 --> 11:56.667
All right, you asked for it.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.834
[yells]

12:05.125 --> 12:08.083
Leaving without your
babysitter's permission, my dear?

12:08.166 --> 12:10.291
Naughty, naughty.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.959
Now give me that doll, you little wretch.
It's worth millions!

12:14.041 --> 12:15.542
Millions?

12:15.625 --> 12:18.291
Mommy needs millions more than you!

12:19.000 --> 12:22.125
No, no, no...
Not the shins! [groans]

12:30.875 --> 12:32.959
Don't be afraid, Cara.

12:33.041 --> 12:35.000
-I'll take care--
-Got you!

12:35.083 --> 12:36.542
[yells]

12:36.625 --> 12:37.500
Drat!

12:42.291 --> 12:44.583
[yelling]

12:49.917 --> 12:52.333
Just wait till I tell my mommy!

12:52.917 --> 12:56.166
Don't six-year-olds ever get tired?

12:57.959 --> 13:01.667
For the eighth time, Rebecca,
we didn't call.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.583
-Honest, Miss Cunningham.
-Something's not right.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.166
Come on.
We'd better check this out.

13:08.959 --> 13:11.750
[Molly] Mommy!
Baloo!

13:12.583 --> 13:13.750
[Covington] Ah-ha!

13:21.125 --> 13:22.792
Molly? Covington?

13:25.083 --> 13:27.417
Maybe they went to Higher for Hire
and we missed them.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.792
Oh, I hope so.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.542
Shh!

13:38.000 --> 13:39.834
Now I have her.

13:39.917 --> 13:43.375
We have to be smart as Danger Woman.

13:51.542 --> 13:55.667
Just give Covy-wovy the doll,
and you can go home.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.291
[tires screech]

13:57.375 --> 14:00.417
Baloo, you and kit check the <i>Duck,</i>
and I'll look in the office.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.625
Oh, blast!
No, you don't!

14:04.291 --> 14:05.417
[groans]

14:14.375 --> 14:15.917
[crashing]

14:20.041 --> 14:21.959
-Did you hear something?
-Uh-uh.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.625
[panting]

14:26.083 --> 14:27.041
Uh-oh!

14:27.750 --> 14:31.333
Ha! No!
I hate that!

14:31.417 --> 14:33.375
Don't think it hasn't been fun,

14:33.458 --> 14:36.250
but this was intended
for other hands than yours.

14:39.166 --> 14:40.166
Bully!

14:40.250 --> 14:41.375
Gentlemen...

14:41.458 --> 14:43.250
What an opportune arrival.

14:43.333 --> 14:47.583
Let me guess, you was just on your way
to deliver the doll

14:47.667 --> 14:49.875
when we happened to bump into you.

14:49.959 --> 14:53.375
[groans] Yes!
How very perceptive of you.

14:53.458 --> 14:58.625
[chuckles] Here it is, Arnold,
the stuff that dreams are made of.

14:58.709 --> 14:59.917
[Arnold] Yeah.

15:04.291 --> 15:08.709
Wait! I know a surefire way
to get that doll...

15:09.625 --> 15:11.709
with this one.

15:15.875 --> 15:19.083
Yes. And she's dressed
like Danger Woman.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.208
Boy, I hope Molly's all right.

15:21.291 --> 15:25.291
That's right, Danger Woman!
Like on the radio.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.375
-[door slams]
-[all] The <i>Sea Duck!</i>

15:27.875 --> 15:29.750
[clattering]

15:32.709 --> 15:35.458
I know you're here somewhere.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.792
-At last!
-[Rebecca] Covington?

15:41.542 --> 15:44.834
I thought you were
supposed to be babysitting.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.750
I... Oh, well, I...

15:47.834 --> 15:51.458
Oh, Rebecca, darling, forgive me.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.709
-Molly has been kidnapped.
-Kidnapped?

15:54.792 --> 15:57.667
Calm down, Baloo.
I'll handle this.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.417
Kidnapped?!

15:59.500 --> 16:03.709
She's been taken to Skull Island
until they get this doll.

16:03.792 --> 16:06.500
So, let's give it to 'em.
Come on!

16:06.583 --> 16:12.417
Oh, it's my fault she's gone.
If only I wasn't allergic to pain.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.917
-I shall deliver it.
-Now, hold it.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.166
Haven't you been
sniffing around after this doll?

16:20.250 --> 16:23.417
I... I have no notion what you could mean.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.208
I feel responsible for Molly, that's all.

16:26.291 --> 16:29.834
Don't worry, Covy. We're all going.
We'd never make you do this by yourself.

16:30.417 --> 16:32.875
Thank you so very much.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.458
[badgers grunting]

16:40.208 --> 16:41.792
Ow! Grab her!

16:41.875 --> 16:43.709
[groans] You grab her.

16:43.792 --> 16:47.750
When I see Covington again,
I'm gonna pop him like a balloon.

16:49.333 --> 16:53.125
Why would anybody
want this ugly old doll anyway?

16:53.208 --> 16:54.542
Sentimental value?

16:54.625 --> 16:57.041
Covington, I don't know what's going on,

16:57.125 --> 17:00.041
all I want I is to get
Molly back safe, and soon.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.166
I got romance and adventure

17:02.250 --> 17:05.040
and may have lost my daughter
in the process.

17:07.791 --> 17:10.541
-[badger] Ouch!
-[badgers grunting]

17:13.250 --> 17:15.875
Remind me to give up kidnapping.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.791
[Arnold]
At least she don't weigh much.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.750
[Kit]
There they are!

17:29.792 --> 17:32.375
-Here's the doll, Baloo.
-Thanks.

17:34.208 --> 17:37.041
Here's what you want.
Now, where's the girl?

17:37.125 --> 17:40.125
-Let's see it.
-No. Molly first.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.959
Why not?

17:44.959 --> 17:46.291
Oops.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.375
Grab the doll!

17:53.625 --> 17:54.792
[doll] <i>Mama.</i>

17:54.875 --> 17:58.583
Hey, Covington, it's the wrong...
Covington?

17:59.041 --> 18:00.458
Where is he?

18:00.542 --> 18:03.542
That dirty double-crosser
must have pulled a switch!

18:03.625 --> 18:05.709
Never mind him.
Where's Molly?

18:05.792 --> 18:08.875
You want the girl.
We want Covington.

18:08.959 --> 18:12.750
I know where we'll probably find him.
Come on.

18:14.625 --> 18:17.000
[squawking]

18:21.792 --> 18:25.000
[Molly]
It's all creepy, and he's got Cara.

18:34.542 --> 18:38.208
I've done it!
It is beyond imagining.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.625
The treasure must be near.
I can sense it.

18:50.709 --> 18:53.875
All I need is a sign!

19:04.166 --> 19:06.166
Whoa!

19:14.417 --> 19:17.625
I hope someone somewhere
is enjoying all this.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.083
[gasping]

19:30.208 --> 19:34.208
Oh, no more.
Please. No more.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.959
I've got it.
The largest ruby in the world.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.792
[laughs]
No one can stop me now.

19:48.875 --> 19:52.458
-It's finally mine!
-[Molly] It's my mommy's.

19:54.709 --> 19:57.291
Ow!
Not you again!

20:01.792 --> 20:02.792
[gasps]

20:02.875 --> 20:05.917
There's no way out,
you little rug rat!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.291
[groaning]

20:13.917 --> 20:16.333
Hand over that dolly.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.208
You can't have her.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.083
You never loved my mommy.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.959
Ha! Don't make me laugh.

20:27.041 --> 20:30.625
She was just an easy way
to get to you and the doll. [laughing]

20:30.709 --> 20:32.875
Now, give it to me!

20:32.959 --> 20:35.959
No!
[grunting]

20:36.041 --> 20:38.000
Easy way!

20:38.709 --> 20:44.166
Why, you two-faced,
thimble-headed, no-account man!

20:44.250 --> 20:48.333
[Covington] Uh, Rebecca, my peach!
I was only thinking of you.

20:48.417 --> 20:53.667
-Oh? What about your partners?
-Those hairy imbeciles?

20:53.750 --> 20:56.375
Why, I could lose them in a phone booth.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.542
Hiya, partner!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.125
Whoops!

21:03.041 --> 21:05.542
[stuttering]
I didn't mean it, chaps.

21:05.625 --> 21:10.208
It was just a joke.
Can't you take a joke?

21:10.291 --> 21:13.458
The question is, can you take it?

21:13.542 --> 21:14.709
Yeah!

21:20.417 --> 21:23.667
Too bad these things
don't come with brains.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.792
Oh, Molly.
Thank goodness you're safe.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.375
[Molly] Aw, Mommy,
you shouldn't have been scared.

21:35.458 --> 21:38.417
Danger Woman always wins.

21:38.500 --> 21:42.166
But I'm sorry you didn't get the millions.

21:42.250 --> 21:48.792
Yeah, and I'm sorry that Covington cat
turned out so lowdown and dog-dirty.

21:48.875 --> 21:52.125
Thank you, Baloo,
but I got what I wanted.

21:52.208 --> 21:56.709
And I found out you're all
the adventure and romance I need.

21:56.792 --> 22:01.083
Yeah?
Just wait till you tune in next week:

22:01.166 --> 22:05.750
Same Danger time,
same Danger channel.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.875
[Rebecca laughs]
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
