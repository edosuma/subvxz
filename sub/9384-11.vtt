11:27.771 --> 11:28.897
You need an image.

11:28.981 --> 11:32.943
Let's take this Rhode Island lump of clay
and turn it into the toast of New York.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.862
I love toast!

11:34.945 --> 11:37.281
Cut it short and tint it green,
the color of money.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.740
And boogers.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.954
LOIS: I feel like
we've been walking in circles.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.456
I don't know how you can
find anything in this city.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.708
It's so confusing.

11:47.791 --> 11:51.378
Well, I bet if Hillary Clinton becomes
senator, she'll straighten it out...

11:51.461 --> 11:54.006
...even though she could
never straighten out Bill.

11:54.882 --> 11:59.636
I love when you use topical humor.
It's just like watching Murphy Brown.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.389
Hey, Murphy, blah-blah-blah...

12:02.472 --> 12:04.057
...John Sununu.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.685
Murphy, blah-blah-blah...

12:06.768 --> 12:08.270
...Tipper Gore.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.523
Hey, Murph,
you can't blah-blah-blah-blah...

12:11.607 --> 12:13.233
...the Ayatollah.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.904
Blah-blah, Bishop Desmond Tutu,
blah-blah.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.409
Shouldn't my mom and dad
be here by now?

12:22.492 --> 12:25.454
They called and said they'd rather
wander through Soho...

12:25.537 --> 12:27.873
...looking for an address
that doesn't exist.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.374
That's my dad.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.336
-Well, maybe tomorrow we could--
-There's Kate Moss.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.087
Where? I don't see her.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.091
Are you The Matrix?

12:39.051 --> 12:41.720
Kate, this is my newest discovery,
Christobel.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.597
-My name's Chris.
-Not anymore.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.099
Christobel will look better
in Interview magazine.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.352
Nice to meet you. I love artists.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.437
Oops. A crack in the floor!

12:53.106 --> 12:54.358
Hey, Lois, give me a penny.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.194
-You're not gonna throw it over the edge?
-No.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.403
Yes.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.834
Christobel, I've just scheduled
your first exhibit!

13:11.917 --> 13:14.419
Wow! I can't wait to tell my dad.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.923
Yes. I know how important
your success is to your father.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.843
That's why he'll understand
that you can never see him again.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.345
Yeah. Of course he will. Dad's very....

13:23.428 --> 13:25.472
What?

13:25.639 --> 13:29.393
Christobel, the art world
is a place of culture and breeding.

13:29.476 --> 13:33.105
Your father is.... Oh, dear.
How can I say this without upsetting you?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.232
Your dad is a pig!

13:35.315 --> 13:36.942
[Joyful laughter]

13:37.985 --> 13:39.778
So you see? It's up to you, son.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.031
If you don't want to disappoint your dad,
you must keep him away.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.867
There's my boy. Hey, come on.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.077
Let's go over to Barneys
and fart in the suits.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.871
All right, Dad, I....

13:49.663 --> 13:50.956
I mean...

13:51.331 --> 13:53.083
...I can't see you anymore.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.043
What are you talking about?
You're my son.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.129
Mr. Griffin, he's going to be a

13:57.212 --> 13:59.256
great artist.
He now belongs to the public.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.925
And apparently I'm dating Kate Moss.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.096
Don't say anything bad about her,
because she might be here right now.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.432
Wait a minute.
You can't just push me aside.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.185
I made you! And I can destroy you!

14:12.186 --> 14:14.605
Goddamn.
They must've put it in the wrong baby.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.608
Bobby Williams,
I'd love to go out with you.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.324
I can't believe Chris.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.743
If I hadn't used his painting
to patch that window...

14:27.826 --> 14:29.536
...he'd still be in that dump in Quahog.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.288
That "dump" is our home.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.790
Dump? So now
you're too good for us, too?

14:33.874 --> 14:37.753
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for Chris, not you!

14:37.836 --> 14:39.671
Are you so selfish you can't see that?

14:39.755 --> 14:41.089
Yes, I am.

14:41.256 --> 14:44.259
Peter, your son is using his talents
to pursue his dream.

14:44.343 --> 14:46.887
I have no son! Except for Stewie...

14:47.638 --> 14:49.264
...and Meg!

14:51.141 --> 14:53.185
[Singing] "I had a dream

14:53.477 --> 14:55.938
"It's all about you

14:56.146 --> 14:58.106
"Meg Griffin

14:58.190 --> 15:00.692
"Not much you can do

15:01.068 --> 15:03.237

15:06.406 --> 15:08.116
"You can't sing

15:08.200 --> 15:11.495
"No, you pretty much can't do a thing

15:11.578 --> 15:14.915
"Never fear, Daddy's here

15:15.290 --> 15:20.295
"Honey, you're gonna make
our name famous

15:23.298 --> 15:26.885
"You'll be larger than life

15:27.511 --> 15:30.556
"I'll be proud you fell out of my wife

15:30.973 --> 15:34.393
"You'll be known, far and wide

15:34.476 --> 15:38.021
"Like that princess who died

"Wait and see

15:44.611 --> 15:48.532
"Honey, I'm gonna do this for you

15:48.615 --> 15:53.453
"But it's really for me"

16:05.007 --> 16:07.426
Fine. If Chris doesn't need me,
I don't need him.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.929
You're gonna love being famous, Meg.
And this is the town to do it in.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.223
I don't know, Dad. What am I gonna do?

16:13.307 --> 16:14.850
Everybody's good at something.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.769
It's just a matter of finding
that one special hidden talent.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.230
But promise me, when you make it big,

16:20.314 --> 16:22.691
you'll let me take
advantage of all the....

16:37.456 --> 16:40.626
MEG: I can't think of anything.
I guess I don't have any talent.

16:40.709 --> 16:43.670
Come on. Think harder.
There's gotta be something you can do.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.386
-That's amazing!
-Thanks.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.347
I roomed with Scott Hamilton
at prep school.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.431
Nothing happened.

16:54.515 --> 16:57.267
No. I mean that bird just came to Meg
when she whistled.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.102
No, those are just my bird calls.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.521
Do it again!

17:05.692 --> 17:06.735
Yeah?

17:07.110 --> 17:08.612
Well, what did you want?

17:09.738 --> 17:12.991
-You called me, right?
-No. I wasn't calling you.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.286
This is funny to you? Yeah?

17:16.370 --> 17:20.082
You know what a pain in the ass it is
to get across town this time of day?

17:20.165 --> 17:22.626
Listen, mister,
we don't want any trouble here.

17:23.001 --> 17:26.004
I don't fly, you know.
I take the subway like everybody else.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.506
And people don't stare.

17:27.673 --> 17:30.133
You make me puke, bitch.

17:32.427 --> 17:36.265
Mr. Monatti, I don't feel like painting.
I want to see my dad.

17:36.348 --> 17:37.391
Listen, Christobel.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.894
I've sunk $5,000
turning you into a New York bohemian.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.438
All you have to do is paint.
Now, get busy.

17:43.522 --> 17:47.401
I have to go oil up and start squeezing
into my leather pants. Excuse me.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.653
Jeez, Kate, what should I do?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.114
I don't know.
You're the flavor of the month.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.991
Oops. Window open.

17:58.495 --> 17:59.496
[Crow cawing]

18:04.835 --> 18:06.336
-I'm going over there!
-No.

18:06.461 --> 18:09.673
-I'm gonna go over there and punch her!
-No.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.844
This is humiliating.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.555
Hey, it's show business, baby.
You gotta start somewhere.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.640
No, I don't. I quit!

18:18.932 --> 18:22.311
Now wait just a minute, young lady.
Don't you walk away from me!

18:22.561 --> 18:24.897
Hey! Don't you start running!

18:24.980 --> 18:27.482
Wait, Meg! Get off that bus.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.735
Don't you go to La Guardia.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.071
Meg, listen to me.
Don't you dare get on that plane.

18:33.614 --> 18:36.617
Don't you shell out $5 for headphones
for Magnolia.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.951
Okay, now I'm pissed.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.329
-Well, thank God that's over.
-Yeah.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.165
Hey, you want to go crap
on the Statue of Liberty?

18:43.248 --> 18:45.834
I've lived here my whole life,
and I've never been there!

18:45.918 --> 18:47.961
I've never been to
the Empire State Building.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.631
Boy, we're a pair, aren't we?

18:50.714 --> 18:52.424
Unbelievable. Let's go.

19:00.599 --> 19:01.808
Chris!

19:01.975 --> 19:04.645
-Hey, you guys made it!
-Of course.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.480
We wouldn't miss your big day.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.856
Wait a second.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.651
I don't see any strippers
passing out free tacos!

19:10.734 --> 19:11.985
Lois, you lied to me!

19:12.069 --> 19:13.529
Is Dad mad at me?

19:13.612 --> 19:15.656
He just doesn't understand.

19:15.781 --> 19:18.659
I know artists have to
make sacrifices and....

19:18.742 --> 19:20.994
My God! Are you Kate Moss?

19:21.078 --> 19:25.082
Well, for someone with no breasts,
you've done very well for yourself.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.708
Good for you.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.587
MONATTI: 1541...

19:30.671 --> 19:33.423
...Michelangelo unveils
the Sistine Chapel.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.050

...Seurat completes La Grande Jatte.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.598
...Georgia O'Keeffe
paints a lot of flowers

19:41.682 --> 19:43.851

But in the new millennium...

19:45.435 --> 19:48.105
...there is only Christobel.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.654
Hey, that's not art! Amateur!

19:55.737 --> 19:57.364
Hey, that's my dad!

19:57.656 --> 20:01.034
Except for that one.
That's my dad if he were a cat.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.953
He's the whole reason I'm here.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.707
MONATTI: Ladies and gentlemen,
I apologize for these eyesores.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.459
I guess I was wrong about you.
You're no artist.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.211
You're just a no-talent punk!

20:11.295 --> 20:12.379
Now hold on a second!

20:12.462 --> 20:16.592
You can talk to my daughter that way,
but not my son! Now apologize!

20:16.675 --> 20:17.759
The hell I will!

20:17.843 --> 20:20.721
You owe me for all the money I invested
in your worthless son!

20:20.804 --> 20:23.557
All right.
Well, here's a little something in return.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.058
Work of art?

20:25.225 --> 20:28.103
Or container of crazy purple knockout gas?

20:44.244 --> 20:48.790
Dad, I'm sorry I'm not gonna be
a famous artist you can mooch off of.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.918
And I'm sorry I have no talent.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.544
That's okay, kids.

20:52.753 --> 20:55.380
So I don't have my name
on an amusement park.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.257
And maybe I'll never be famous.

20:57.508 --> 21:00.302
But I got three wonderful children
and a wife that loves me.

21:00.385 --> 21:01.470
That's right.

21:01.553 --> 21:04.681
I guess when it comes right down to it,
you're a pretty lucky....

[Vomiting]

21:05.891 --> 21:07.559

21:10.437 --> 21:12.064
Hey, watch where you're going!

21:14.316 --> 21:16.985
This child is beautiful! I must have him!

You mean like Gina Gershon beautiful,
or beautiful beautiful?

fashion designer, Calvin Klein.

I've been looking everywhere for a face
to launch my new line of diapers.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.540
And I think I found it.

Well, Bob Funland may have
his name on a sign...

I'm going to sex you up so crazy!
