¶ Happy birthday to you ¶

00:09.710 --> 00:13.545
¶ Happy birthday to you ¶

00:13.547 --> 00:17.850
¶ Happy birthday dear Willie ¶
¶ Happy birthday dear daddy ¶

00:17.852 --> 00:21.020
¶ Happy birthday to you ¶¶

00:21.022 --> 00:24.023
Thank you.
Thanks, everyone. Thank you.

00:24.025 --> 00:28.293
"To a super dad, husband
and earthling."

00:28.295 --> 00:30.696
That was mine.

00:30.698 --> 00:35.167
Well, thanks. Thanks, everyone.
I'm, I'm very, very touched.

00:35.169 --> 00:37.469
- Thank you, dear.
- Oh, happy birthday, darling.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.672
- Happy birthday, daddy.
- Oh, thank you, son.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.475
- Many more, dad.
- Thanks. Thanks, sweetheart.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.644
Thank you, ALF. Thank..

00:50.551 --> 00:52.418
Whoa! Not bad.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.820
Still waters run deep there,
William.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.759
- Blow out the candles.
- Okay.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.395
Uh, one, two, three, uh..

01:03.397 --> 01:06.598
[all laughing]

01:07.601 --> 01:10.602
'Joke candle, oh, yeah, joke.'

01:10.604 --> 01:11.937
What is this,
the fifth year now?

01:11.939 --> 01:16.442
And I, I fall for it
every single time.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.277
Hey, back off there,
Willie Bob.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.079
- Let me give it a shot.
- 'Oh.'

01:21.415 --> 01:22.514
[Kate gasps]
'ALF!'

01:22.516 --> 01:24.083
What?

01:24.085 --> 01:26.852
[theme music]

02:10.664 --> 02:13.899
[music continues]

02:26.947 --> 02:28.347
(in unison)
Speech! Speech! Speech!

02:28.349 --> 02:30.249
Oh, okay. Okay.

02:30.251 --> 02:34.019
I was born the son
of a poor asteroid polisher.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.688
Uh, I'm supposed to be
making the speech.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.258
I think I know my life
better than you do.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.628
But enough about me.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.029
Thank you.

02:44.031 --> 02:47.366
Well, I don't think I've got
too much to complain about

02:47.368 --> 02:48.600
that's for sure.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.602
I have my health,
I have a wonderful wife

02:50.604 --> 02:53.038
I have two great kids..

02:53.040 --> 02:55.040
...a-and an alien.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.010
Okay. Great speech.
Let's open the presents.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.846
Okay, I'll be right back.
Come on, Brian.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.448
I hope you got me jewelry.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.883
ALF, i-it's Willie's birthday.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.718
He's the one
who gets the presents.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.488
[laughing]
The guy who has the birthday

03:09.490 --> 03:11.290
also gets the presents?

03:12.393 --> 03:15.027
Talk about your whacky planet.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.728
Okay, dad, close your eyes.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.064
(Willie)
'Oh.'

03:19.066 --> 03:21.867
Okay...open!

03:21.869 --> 03:23.835
- Happy birthday, darling.
- Oh.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.904
Kate, it's "The Cambridge Atlas
Of Astronomy."

03:25.906 --> 03:27.573
- Yeah.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.074
- Let me see this.
- You're welcome.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.409
(Willie)
'See, I've been
eyeing that book'

03:30.411 --> 03:31.910
'in the bookstore for weeks.'

03:31.912 --> 03:33.812
'You know, I was gonna wait
until it came out in paperback'

03:33.814 --> 03:35.180
but.. What are you doing?

03:35.182 --> 03:37.416
I'm correcting the more
glaring errors.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.652
Look at this.
They left out the tenth planet.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.354
Dave.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.156
Give me that.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.592
You know..

03:46.594 --> 03:49.094
...I think you make things up.

03:50.397 --> 03:54.066
You told me there was a race
of cucumber people on Mars.

03:54.068 --> 03:58.437
Not a race, a family.
A small family.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.706
They're mean!

04:00.708 --> 04:02.341
Here.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.610
Happy birthday!

04:04.612 --> 04:07.112
[gasps]
Well, thanks. What is it?

04:07.114 --> 04:09.548
I don't know, something I found
in the basement

04:09.550 --> 04:11.283
behind the chemical toilet.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.417
Oh, how thoughtful.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.720
Well, I can't exactly
go out and shop!

04:14.722 --> 04:16.221
Oh, no, no.
I mean it is charming.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.624
This one's very thoughtful,
ALF, thank you.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.792
L-look at these,
these are pictures.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.628
These are our high school,
our college pictures.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.630
Oh, my gosh!
I don't believe this!

04:24.632 --> 04:26.465
- There's old letters in there.
- Oh.

04:26.467 --> 04:30.302
Mom, who is this gorgeous guy
with his arm around you?

04:30.304 --> 04:32.638
Oh, that's Animal Honerhime.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.972
Animal?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.941
Your mother dated
a lot of gorgeous guys

04:35.943 --> 04:39.244
before she met me. Not that
I wasn't gorgeous myself.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.980
Hey, who is this guy
that looks like Harrison Ford?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.815
Uh, that's Nolan Westwood.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.817
Who's this guy
in the stupid-looking clothes?

04:45.819 --> 04:48.153
That's a football uniform, ALF.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.822
I know this guy.
He's an old-timer.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.058
What's his name? Joe..

04:53.060 --> 04:54.793
Namath.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.995
You dated Joe Namath?

04:57.931 --> 05:00.732
The panty hose guy? Wow!

05:01.935 --> 05:04.169
Mom, you really went out
with some hunks.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.572
But I married
the best hunk of them all.

05:07.574 --> 05:10.142
Oh, my gosh! Here's a menu.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.844
Oh, look, it's an old menu
from that little restaurant

05:12.846 --> 05:14.680
that, uh,
Kate and I discovered.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.448
- Oh.
- Let's order.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.650
The restaurant's
been closed for 20 years.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.087
- Then why are we ordering?
- We're not ordering.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.523
Oh, honey, look what we wrote
on the back. It's our list.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.957
What list?

05:25.959 --> 05:28.360
Well, your father and I
each made a list of things

05:28.362 --> 05:30.529
that we wanted to accomplish
in our lives.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.931
You know,
our goals, dreams.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.033
Can I see it?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.836
Look what mom wrote,
"To ski the Eagles Nest

05:37.838 --> 05:39.805
"at Squaw Valley.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.039
"To have a poem published

05:41.041 --> 05:44.142
"in a major literary magazine.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.645
To run with the bulls
at Pamplona."

05:46.647 --> 05:48.380
She did all that too.

05:48.382 --> 05:52.351
Wow, Kate, you little
overachiever you.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.985
Yeah. Way to go, mom.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.487
Oh, well, you know
how I am with lists.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.522
I love crossing things off.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.558
- Where's your list, dad?
- Oh, it's in there.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.893
I-I think I wrote it
under the catch of the day.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.796
Let me see that.
I may want sea bass.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.998
We're not ordering.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.235
Alright, alright.
Let me read this. Wait a minute.

06:10.237 --> 06:13.472
"Willie Tanner,
goals and ambitions.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.209
Number one,
to build a better mousetrap."

06:17.211 --> 06:19.044
Well, that must have been
a piece of cake.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.980
Not exactly, I-I-I'm
still working on that one.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.418
"Number two,
complete that skydive."

06:26.420 --> 06:28.220
Complete that skydive?

06:28.222 --> 06:30.522
How do you skydive
just a little bit?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.224
Do you jump halfway?

06:33.694 --> 06:35.861
No, you..

06:35.863 --> 06:38.029
...you get ready to jump..

06:38.031 --> 06:39.331
...you have second thoughts

06:39.333 --> 06:40.866
you go back to your seat
to sit down.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.101
Oh, you chicken out.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.437
N-no, you decide<i> not</i> to jump.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.939
- You come to your senses.
- Yes, you have second thoughts.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.975
You decide not to be stupid.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.611
Alright, alright.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.880
(Willie and ALF)
You chicken out.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.449
Now, how about
some of that wet cake?

06:57.451 --> 06:58.517
Yeah.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.420
[instrumental music]

07:10.898 --> 07:12.531
- Yo, Willie.
- Yo, uh..

07:12.533 --> 07:15.133
- What are you workin' on?
- My mousetrap.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.402
Uh-huh.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.571
You might have a little
trouble slipping that baby

07:19.573 --> 07:21.139
behind a refrigerator.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.443
Say, uh, don't you have
some sleeping to do?

07:24.445 --> 07:28.413
No, I always wake up
around 3:00, 3:30

07:28.415 --> 07:32.617
have a couple of potatoes
and, uh, wait for my papers.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.154
- What a life.
- Yeah, so far no complaints.

07:36.156 --> 07:39.224
- Want a cold spud?
- No. No, thanks.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.992
'Cause I ate
the rest of the cake.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.494
- I should tell you that now.
- That's okay.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.496
And the candles.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.164
Listen, uh..

07:46.166 --> 07:49.334
...ALF, I, I'd really
like to finish this thing.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.336
Why bother?

07:51.338 --> 07:55.173
Because I like to finish
something I start.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.242
You never finished that skydive.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.012
Did you ever set goals
for yourself

08:01.014 --> 08:02.681
that you weren't
able to accomplish?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.349
- No.
- N-none?

08:04.351 --> 08:06.685
Melmacians don't
set goals really.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.420
We live from moment to moment.

08:08.422 --> 08:10.789
- From snack to snack.
- Yes.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.858
We take time to stop and..

08:12.860 --> 08:15.360
...smell the potatoes.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.529
Did you ever jump
out of a moving plane?

08:17.531 --> 08:19.264
Hey, you wanna be alone,
just tell me.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.934
No, no, I mean,
did-did, did you ever skydive?

08:22.936 --> 08:25.136
I fell to Earth at Mach 16.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.338
What was that like?

08:26.340 --> 08:29.107
Imagine Mach 8, and double it.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.478
- Weren't you scared?
- Not once I started plummeting.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.880
Mmm.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.982
Hey, Willie,
don't worry about it.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.817
You don't have
to prove anything.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.719
You're a good provider.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.955
You've got a couple
of great kids and an alien.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.557
You don't run around.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.627
And your life is incredibly
predictable and safe.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.828
[thud]

08:49.830 --> 08:51.630
There's my paper.<i> Ciao.</i>

08:52.566 --> 08:55.367
[instrumental music]

08:59.406 --> 09:01.439
- Kate
- Yeah?

09:03.143 --> 09:05.210
You ever hear from Nolan?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.913
Nolan who?

09:07.915 --> 09:10.148
Nolan Westwood.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.685
No. Why?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.353
Oh, uh, I don't know,
I just wondered

09:15.355 --> 09:19.558
if you've heard from him since,
you know since college.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.428
Actually, I heard
that he went to New Guinea

09:23.430 --> 09:25.664
and never came back.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.333
Oh, that's...that's too bad.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.670
Some tribe
made him their king.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.041
- W-why do you ask?
- Oh, nothing.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.443
I wa.. I was just, uh,
I was just curious.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.679
Oh.

09:40.681 --> 09:44.783
Does he have any real power
or is he just a figurehead?

09:44.785 --> 09:48.086
Well, uh...
he's on the stamps.

09:56.530 --> 10:00.131
- What about Joe?
- Joe who?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.034
You know...the football guy.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.537
- Theismann?
- No.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.372
Joe Namath.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.742
Did you go out
with Joe Theismann too?

10:10.744 --> 10:15.714
No, honey. Just Namath. Why are
you bringing all this up?

10:15.716 --> 10:20.452
Kate, you think of me as
incredibly predictable

10:20.454 --> 10:22.320
and safe?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.488
Yes.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.726
That's why I'm here with you,
right now.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.833
Now, go to sleep.
You have a busy day tomorrow.

10:36.603 --> 10:41.573
Yeah. I gotta take the wagon
and get the radiator flushed.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.643
After that, I'm going to,
uh, stop at the hardware

10:44.645 --> 10:46.511
and see if the lawn sprinkler
has come in yet.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.279
Hmm.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.949
Having lunch
with Cousin Verne.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.351
He talked to me
about his new edger.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.521
After that..

10:56.523 --> 10:59.924
...I decided
I'm gonna go skydiving.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.259
Mmm.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.865
- Goodnight, dear.
- Goodnight.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.405
[instrumental music]

11:16.043 --> 11:17.409
Ah!

11:18.779 --> 11:20.612
Excuse me.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.347
Where am I?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.549
You're at your graduation.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.219
Well, uh, well,
what am I graduating from?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.388
Uh, this is a dream, Tanner.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.958
Its purpose is to point out
how inadequate you are

11:33.960 --> 11:36.394
compared to everybody else.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.229
That sounds like fun.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.765
Would you mind
standing off to the side?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.969

11:44.971 --> 11:46.204

11:46.807 --> 11:48.339

11:51.845 --> 11:54.479

11:54.481 --> 11:58.583
Congratulations, Nolan,

11:58.585 --> 12:01.252
world traveler
and New Guinean king.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.789
Thank you.
Here are some stamps and coins.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.058
He's on the money too?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.194
- Tanner, quiet.
- I'm sorry.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.662
Listen, I've got to go.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.664
They're having a little ceremony
for me back home.

12:12.666 --> 12:15.400
I'm being bumped up
from king to God.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.371
- Congratulations, Nolan.
- Thanks, bub.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.074
You've really,
you've really done quite well.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.277
You're telling me? I've lead a
life of travel and adventure.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.446
I'm rich, I'm famous.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.616
I have a species of bird
named after me.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.853
I'll have my mortgage
paid off in eight years.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.956
Unless we refinance, of course,
Kate and I are still kicking--

12:37.958 --> 12:41.292
Yeah, say hi to her for me,
will ya? What a cutie.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.261
[swooshing]

12:43.263 --> 12:46.431
Your mortgage will be paid off.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.371
Next up, Lyle Animal Honerhime

12:53.373 --> 12:56.641
jet-setter, yachtsman,
international financier.

12:56.643 --> 13:00.812
Come on out here, Animal,
and get your diploma.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.413
You rich guy you.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.982
[all cheering]

13:03.984 --> 13:06.317
Thank you, Dean Houseman.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.989
Wow! Have you done well!

13:10.991 --> 13:12.257
Yeah, I'm quite a guy.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.392
You've won the Indianapolis 500

13:14.394 --> 13:16.427
you're listed
in the Fortune 500

13:16.429 --> 13:19.164
and in the National League
you batted 500.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.332
Listen, I got to run,
we're having 500 people

13:21.334 --> 13:23.134
over for dinner tonight.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.669
Animal.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.838
Uh, no, we've already got
somebody to park the cars.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.508
No, no, no, I just, uh,
I just wanted to say

13:30.510 --> 13:32.811
hello, I'm, I'm Willie Tanner.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.112
Tanner.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.681
Well, I married
Kate Halligan.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.183
Kate Halligan.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.450
Say hello to her for me,
will ya?

13:39.452 --> 13:42.253
You know, she is one in 500.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.292
[swooshing]

13:47.294 --> 13:49.294
And now..

13:49.296 --> 13:51.262
...our next recipient

13:51.264 --> 13:53.765
needs no introduction.

13:53.767 --> 13:57.001
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joe Namath.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.203
[all cheering]

13:58.205 --> 14:01.439
Hey, Joe, go on out
for a long one, huh?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.541
I was just kiddin'.
Here you go, Joe.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.376
Thanks. Uh, say,
what's going on here?

14:05.378 --> 14:07.545
Uh, uh,
Willie's having a dream.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.448
- Willie!
- Hello, Joe.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.884
I'm sorry
to drag you into this.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.954
Oh, hey, that's cool. I've been
doing a lot of dreams lately.

14:15.956 --> 14:19.390
Next week I'm doing
a Howard Cosell nightmare.

14:19.392 --> 14:23.394
Oh, oh, gee, Joe,
you've done awfully well.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.064
Say, would you,
would you autograph this..

14:26.066 --> 14:28.366
...for my son Brian?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.301
Absolutely.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.876
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Joe.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.245
"To Brian..

14:40.247 --> 14:42.981
...tell your mom hello."

14:42.983 --> 14:46.017
You know what, I always
think about what Kate said

14:46.019 --> 14:47.518
when I proposed to her.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.587
Yeah, and that's how
I got the bad knees

14:49.589 --> 14:51.256
by the way, kneeling.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.524
She said, "Broadway.."

14:53.526 --> 14:55.526
She always called me Broadway.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.729
She said,
"Thanks, but no thanks.

14:57.731 --> 15:02.000
I'm looking for someone
that's...predictable and safe."

15:02.936 --> 15:04.936
So long, Willie.

15:06.940 --> 15:07.939
[swooshing]

15:07.941 --> 15:09.173
Oh.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.510
I'm going skydiving tomorrow!

15:12.512 --> 15:14.946
[imitating Willie]
I'm going skydiving tomorrow!

15:16.249 --> 15:18.016
You had your chance.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.255
And now it gives me
great pleasure to introduce

15:24.257 --> 15:28.126
our man of the century,
someone whose accomplishments

15:28.128 --> 15:31.763
put the rest of us to shame,
a person of whom it can truly

15:31.765 --> 15:36.467
be said, "He changed
the way we look at the world."

15:36.469 --> 15:42.240
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Gordon "ALF" Shumway.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.043
[all cheering]

15:50.650 --> 15:52.250
- ALF.
- Hey, ALF, great to see you.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.284
Way to go.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.552
- What a guy!
- He's the best.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.820
Say, ALF,
can I have your autograph?

15:55.822 --> 15:56.788
Sure, Joe.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.090
Oh-ho, wait till
my friends see this.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.626
Oh. Here you go.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.494
- Thanks.
- ALF.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.431
- Willie.
- ALF?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.066
Willie.

16:08.068 --> 16:12.971
- You're the man of the century?
- Yeah, what a surprise!

16:12.973 --> 16:15.173
I was happy
just to be nominated.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.841
What a kick!

16:16.843 --> 16:19.677
- Well, congratulations!
- Thanks.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.181
Hey, Willie, you never know
next century it could be you.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.116
I don't think so.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.786
Hey, come on,
don't be so negative.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.190
All you have to do
is take this parachute

16:32.192 --> 16:36.160
and jump, Willie. Jump! Jump!

16:36.162 --> 16:39.263
(all)
Jump! Jump! Jump!

16:39.265 --> 16:42.200
Jump! Jump! Jump!

16:42.202 --> 16:44.369
Jump! Jump! Jump!

16:44.371 --> 16:46.838
'Jump! Jump! Jump!'

16:48.174 --> 16:49.307
Jump!

16:49.309 --> 16:50.875
(in unison)
Jump! Jump!

16:50.877 --> 16:53.978
- Jump, Willie, jump.
- Now, hit, roll. Huh?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.880
Hit, roll.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.048
[sighs]

16:57.050 --> 16:58.182
How was that?

17:00.453 --> 17:03.021
I thought the roll was supposed
to come right after the hit.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.656
You mean, you mean there
was a pause between the two?

17:05.658 --> 17:08.726
There was enough time
to send out for pizzas.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.195
Now that's a thought.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.698
- Can I try it?
- Yeah, sure.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.233
Come on, hit, roll, huh?

17:15.235 --> 17:18.136
Hit, roll. Hit, roll!

17:18.138 --> 17:20.805
Yes. Yes! Yes.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.041
There's nothing
to this skydiving stuff.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.642
It's boring.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.245
Let's take a break here.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.148
Yeah, good idea.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.651
You know, uh, ALF,
I had the strangest dream

17:33.653 --> 17:36.421
last night...and you were in it.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.090
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.591
It was really weird.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.828
There was you
and there were these three guys

17:43.830 --> 17:46.564
that Kate used to go out with.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.232
What's weird about that?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.601
Well, what were you doing in it?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.570
Now that you brought it up

17:52.572 --> 17:54.972
I think Kate's been
coming on to me lately.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.510
I, I really think
you're mistaking friendliness

17:59.512 --> 18:01.612
for, uh, something else.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.116
Then I guess I shouldn't
have sent her flowers.

18:05.118 --> 18:08.286
- You sent my wife flowers?
- Okay, break's over.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.454
[blows whistle]

18:09.456 --> 18:10.788
Let's, uh,
let's get on with this.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.525
Come on.
Enough of this idle chit-chat.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.962
Hit, roll. Hit! Roll!

18:18.598 --> 18:19.864
Yeah.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.800
- How about it?
- Not bad.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.869
If that had been a real jump
you'd have just driven

18:24.871 --> 18:27.271
your femur into your spleen.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.975
Oh, Willie,
the flowers are beautiful.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.144
Honey, what's the occasion?

18:33.146 --> 18:36.047
Uh, it's just because
he loves you, that's all.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.983
Oh, I love you too.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.952
Oh, w-well,
what's going on here?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.554
Oh, I was, uh, just
practicing my hit and roll.

18:43.556 --> 18:47.425
- That's skydiving lingo.
- Sky..

18:47.427 --> 18:49.160
So that is what you said
last night.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.430
Yeah, I decided I'm,
I'm gonna take the plunge.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.165
And don't try
talking him out of this.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.734
ALF, do you mind?

18:56.736 --> 18:58.503
You're really serious
about this, aren't you?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.404
Yup.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.340
Why are you doing this?

19:02.342 --> 19:07.411
I'm doing this because
I feel I have to do this.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.681
Because of something you wrote
on a menu 25 years ago?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.350
I thought it was 20.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.918
ALF.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.688
Twenty five years ago

19:17.690 --> 19:19.757
five people went up in a plane

19:19.759 --> 19:21.993
and four people jumped.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.262
You didn't jump
because you didn't wanna jump.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.498
I didn't jump
because I was afraid to jump.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.066
You're not afraid now?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.203
I am afraid..

19:33.306 --> 19:34.972
...but I feel..

19:34.974 --> 19:38.709
...that this is something
I have to do.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.612
If jumping out
of an airplane at 5000 feet

19:41.614 --> 19:43.915
is that important to you,
you should do it.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.119
We'll be there watching.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.795
5000 feet? I thought
they said it was 4000.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.231
I think it's 10,000.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.899
[instrumental music]

20:03.903 --> 20:06.404
[airplane whirring]

20:08.474 --> 20:10.341
We're nearing the drop zone!

20:10.343 --> 20:12.476
[all cheering]

20:12.478 --> 20:14.412
- Are we pumped?
- We're pumped!

20:14.414 --> 20:17.481
We're all pumped, alright.
We're-we're pumped as can be.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.083
Uh, pumped as a tire,
in fact.

20:19.085 --> 20:21.018
Good, that's what
I like to hear!

20:21.020 --> 20:22.486
- Uh, Mr. Tanner.
- Yeah.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.389
I noticed you didn't check off
the life insurance box.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.525
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.694
That'll be, uh, two bucks.

20:29.696 --> 20:33.397
Uh, I don't know, would it be
alright if I paid you later?

20:33.399 --> 20:37.068
- Huh. Good one.
- Oh, boy.

20:39.072 --> 20:42.740
We are now directly
over the drop zone.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.276
Skydivers, prepare for flight.

20:45.278 --> 20:48.779
And watch out
for that first step.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.682
Oh, ha ha. Good one!

20:53.019 --> 20:55.019
A-a-are you
doing this for fun?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.954
Or-or-or do you
have a list too?

20:56.956 --> 21:00.258
- Excuse me?
- Oh, never mind.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.593
This is my first time.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.462
- Nervous, huh?
- Yeah, a little.

21:04.464 --> 21:08.466
Nothing to worry about,
just like jumping off a cliff.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.637
- Collin!
- Yo!

21:12.639 --> 21:14.705
[whooshing]

21:14.707 --> 21:17.875
- Pumanski!
- Yo!

21:20.380 --> 21:23.247
- Burner!
- Yo!

21:23.249 --> 21:25.616
Hey, listen,
if anything happens to me

21:25.618 --> 21:27.551
tell them
no life support systems.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.954
- Gotcha.
- Yeah!

21:31.658 --> 21:34.091
- Tanner!
- Present, yes.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.295
- You're supposed to say yo!
- Oh, right, yo!

21:42.001 --> 21:45.569
Uh, listen, I,
here's what I've decided.

21:45.571 --> 21:48.005
I-I-I can't do this,
I-I-I won't do it.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.841
I mean, I-I don't need to do it,
so I'm not going to do it.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.010
Uh, that-that's what
I wanted to tell you.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.812
You see, I was, I was sitting
back there and listening to

21:54.814 --> 21:57.448
everybody say yo and all
that and I thought to myself

21:57.450 --> 21:59.350
"Do I really want to plummet?"

21:59.352 --> 22:01.018
And I had to admit

22:01.020 --> 22:03.454
no...I-I don't
feel like plummeting

22:03.456 --> 22:05.956
so I'm not gonna do it,
I'm gonna go back over there

22:05.958 --> 22:08.859
and I'll sit down. Uh, uh,
that's, that's where I'll be.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.461
R-right over there, okay?

22:10.463 --> 22:12.163
W-what?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.398
Oh, nothing.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.870
Ah, what the hell.

(Lynn)
'ALF? ALF?'

22:41.461 --> 22:44.128
In here!

22:44.130 --> 22:46.497
[laughing]
What are you doing?

22:46.499 --> 22:48.566
Building a better cat trap.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.868
[thud]

22:51.838 --> 22:53.237
How'd the jump go?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.139
- Great, he did it.
- Yeah.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.240
- Yeah.
- Nice going, Willie.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.075
Hey, let's hear it
for the Tan man.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.578
- That's right.
- Thank you, thank you.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.179
Thank you very much, thank you.

23:02.181 --> 23:05.983
It was nothing,
it was like jumping off a cliff.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.852
Are you gonna do it again?

23:07.854 --> 23:09.820
Not in your lifetime.

23:09.822 --> 23:13.357
Well, I'm gonna jump as soon as
Lash gets his pilot's license.

23:13.359 --> 23:17.094
I think we'll all jump when
Lash gets his pilot's license.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.864
ALF, you would have been
really, really proud of him.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.532
I was proud of him
before he jumped.

23:21.534 --> 23:25.770
You said he'd end up
a red smear on the landscape.

23:25.772 --> 23:30.908
I said he<i> might</i> end up
a red smear on the landscape.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.545
Well, honey, tell me, what's
next for the conquering hero?

23:34.547 --> 23:36.180
Oh, I don't know.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.883
I was thinking about that
on the way down.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.285
I'd still like to discover
that new galaxy.

23:41.287 --> 23:43.521
I don't know,
maybe play pro-football

23:43.523 --> 23:47.458
for a couple of years, take the
whole gang, move to New Guinea.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.859
[laughing]

23:48.861 --> 23:51.128
Of course, first..

23:51.130 --> 23:52.897
...I have to get
the radiator flushed.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.399
