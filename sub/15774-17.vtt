00:11.110 --> 00:13.812
Run faster, jump higher,
and dunk harder.

00:13.814 --> 00:14.913
- They look nice.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.915
- They're gonna
even look nicer on your face

00:16.917 --> 00:20.151

your laces are--

00:26.226 --> 00:28.760
- Extra long
for extra support?

00:28.762 --> 00:30.262
Hope you brought
your umbrella

00:30.264 --> 00:33.398

to pay for it.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.528
You just press quick click.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.996

01:37.998 --> 01:40.732
The quick click is connected
to my bank account.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.034

if this qualifies

08:00.046 --> 08:01.446
As a breakthrough
or not,

Uh, but this week,

08:02.949 --> 08:05.984
I've decided to try
online dating.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.119
- It's group therapy.

I don't need
group therapy.

- Sam, do you have
anything you'd like
to share?

08:15.394 --> 08:18.262
- I had a, uh, I had
a setback this week.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.331
I shot my dry cleaner.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.466
- Huh?

08:21.468 --> 08:22.767
- Oh, it's just
a water pistol,

08:22.769 --> 08:25.370
But I--I just kept
a-shootin'.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.771
I couldn't stop.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.139
I just felt so angry.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.307
- Why were you angry?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.542
- They didn't get
the stain out
of my kerchief.

08:31.544 --> 08:36.647
- Do you think your anger
might have been misdirected?

08:36.649 --> 08:41.085
- Oh, wow. I hadn't
thought of that.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.520
Well, I wasn't mad
at him at all.

08:42.522 --> 08:47.025
- Who do you think
you're actually
angry with?

08:47.259 --> 08:48.559
- It was those kids.

08:48.561 --> 08:49.794
I'm mad at all those kids

08:49.796 --> 08:52.030
Who used to tease me
on the playground.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.566
It's not my fault
I had a mustache
in third grade.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.302
I just wanted to be
like everybody else.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.772
No one gave me a chance.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.040
[sam crying]
- oh, boy.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.042
- And what about you?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.977
- Oh! Oh!

09:05.979 --> 09:07.111
- Oh, me? Oh, I'm good.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.747
I mean, I've been
doing a lot of online
shopping lately,

09:09.749 --> 09:11.049
But I don't have
a problem.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.850
At least, not compared
to these guys,

09:12.852 --> 09:14.819
Who are obviously
all crazy.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.654
[marvin blinks]

09:16.922 --> 09:20.758
So, I'm just gonna
go ahead and go.

09:22.227 --> 09:23.961
- Where you going?

09:23.963 --> 09:25.530
Do some online shopping?

09:25.532 --> 09:27.465
- I know what
you're trying to do.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.100
You want me
to break down and cry

09:29.102 --> 09:31.502
And say that the reason
I keep buying stuff

09:31.504 --> 09:34.439
Is because I'm trying
to fill an emotional void,

09:34.441 --> 09:37.575
That all this confidence
is a facade,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.110
It's all fake,

09:39.112 --> 09:39.844
That deep down,

09:39.846 --> 09:44.682
I'm just an insecure,
scared, needy little duck

for you?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.358
- Uh, no. Not really.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.759
- Because I'm trying
to take into account

10:28.761 --> 10:31.262
Other people's needs,
not just my own.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.298
So, if it's not a good time
for you, just tell me.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.867
- It's not a good time.

- Ok, good. Ahem.

I've joined

10:39.806 --> 10:41.772
You probably don't
know this about me,

10:41.774 --> 10:45.376
But I have some
fairly significant
emotional issues.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.912
Now, I know I've
done a good job
covering them up,

10:47.914 --> 10:50.014
But I'm going
to finally confront them

10:50.016 --> 10:52.116
In the hopes of becoming
a better person.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.985
- Daffy, can we talk
about this another--

10:53.987 --> 10:55.953
- The kind of person
who listens,

10:55.955 --> 11:00.224
Who takes into consideration
what other people want,

11:00.226 --> 11:01.893
What other people need.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.961
- Daffy, I need
to get back to work.

a lot of changes in me.

about all this?

11:13.139 --> 11:13.938
- Fine. Great.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.175
- You're a very strong,
brave woman.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.676
That's what I hope
to become.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.947
I'm so glad this was
a good time for you
to talk.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.185
- Well, guess what, elves?

11:27.187 --> 11:30.288

the shroud of guanjaro,

11:30.290 --> 11:32.523

I had such
an amazing experience
today in group.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.337
It's like
when one door opens,

11:46.339 --> 11:47.371
Behind it is
another door

11:47.373 --> 11:48.973
You didn't even
know existed,

11:48.975 --> 11:50.942
And sometimes,
that door is locked.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.511
But now, I have
the tool to open it.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.514
- The key.
- Yes, exactly.

11:56.516 --> 12:00.818
The key. That is
the tool you use
to open a door.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.286
Granted, I had my share of--

12:02.288 --> 12:05.389
- Demons.
- Yes, exactly. Demons.

past one today

I'm gonna call him.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.334
- No!
- I shouldn't call him?

12:16.336 --> 12:17.568
- Go.
- You're right.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.869
I should do it
in person.

- Go! Go!
- Ok, I'm going.

in group today,

14:51.691 --> 14:54.492
Was that all
the mean things
I ever said to you,

mistreated you,

feels that way?

I've learned that
one-on-one interventions

17:27.780 --> 17:31.448
Can feel confrontational
and tend to escalate,

17:31.450 --> 17:33.250
Whereas group
interventions

Are more supportive.

- ¶ you know,
environmentalists say, ¶

20:45.644 --> 20:47.711
¶ "your car is too big,"

20:47.713 --> 20:48.812

¶ "your planet's
too small" ¶
