WEBVTT

00:17.118 --> 00:19.451
You're gonna
be all right, Faith.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.453
We're here, baby.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.022
Wake up, now.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.123
Faith?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.057
Wake up, Faith.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.091
Hang on!

00:26.093 --> 00:28.193
I'm comin'.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.428
Here we go!

00:29.430 --> 00:31.296
Okay, baby, I'll get you out.

00:31.298 --> 00:32.798
I'll get you out, Faith.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.401
Faith, stay with me.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.202
Somebody help me, help me!

00:37.204 --> 00:38.670
Somebody help me, please!

00:38.672 --> 00:39.538
Help me!

00:39.540 --> 00:40.606
You, stop!

00:40.608 --> 00:42.141
Okay, sir, set her down.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.176
Help me! Her name is Faith.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.310
Sir, you have to move.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.678
I told her to buckle!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.682
Doctor, have you
seen Dr. Raleigh?

00:50.684 --> 00:52.651
Dr. Raleigh's in a
code. I'll take care of it.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.119
Kids, you wait for
Daddy right there, okay?

00:54.121 --> 00:55.721
But your wife's having a baby!

00:55.723 --> 00:57.423
You shouldn't be here.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.391
No, no, just one floor
up, I've got plenty of time.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.826
Tell me what happened, sir.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.595
We got cut off.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.230
Went off the road, hit a ditch.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.366
- BP is 90 over 60, pulse 135.
- I don't really remember.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.467
I don't really
know what happened!

01:08.469 --> 01:09.668
Get her to radiology right now.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.136
I want a head and
a neck CT, stat.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.488
Go, go, go!

01:12.489 --> 01:13.839
What? No, wait, I got to go.
I got to be with her!

01:13.841 --> 01:15.240
Security!

01:15.242 --> 01:17.743
Sir, how much alcohol
have you had today?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.244
- Hmm?
- Wait, what?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.345
Security, keep him here.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.647
Please, keep him here.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.182
I got to go with
her, that's my daughter!

01:23.184 --> 01:24.283
Your daughter's safe in my hand.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.584
I will take care
of her, all right?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.252
That's my Faith, I
have to go with them!

01:27.254 --> 01:28.253
I have to go with them!

01:28.255 --> 01:29.755
- No!
- I have to go with her!

01:29.757 --> 01:31.356
Did you leave
the scene of an accident?

01:31.358 --> 01:33.258
My daughter's hurt back
there and I need to be there.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.460
No, hey, if you don't calm down,

01:34.462 --> 01:35.828
I will put these on you.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.363
Look, I don't
have time for this!

01:38.365 --> 01:39.365
Faith!

01:43.237 --> 01:44.436
- Back off!
- Hey!

01:44.438 --> 01:45.771
- Back off!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:45.773 --> 01:47.239
You pull that trigger
and you will never see

01:47.241 --> 01:49.191
your daughter again.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.142
You won't see tomorrow
unless I see my Faith.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.711
Give me the gun now!

01:52.713 --> 01:54.313
Waiting room, code silver.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.315
Look around you.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.897
Look how you're
freaking out the kids.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.386
Think of your little
girl, Faith, right?

02:01.388 --> 02:03.489
What would Faith want you to do?

02:06.260 --> 02:09.661
She's all I got.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.163
I can't lose her.

02:12.399 --> 02:17.336
I can't lose my Faith.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.577
That's my Faith.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.479
You can't take her.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.849
You can't take her!

02:49.603 --> 02:50.836
Ooh, that one.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.173
Did you find your dress yet?

02:54.175 --> 02:55.307
No way, mister.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.411
The first time
you're gonna see me

02:59.413 --> 03:01.680
in my wedding dress is when
I'm walking down the aisle.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.682
Oh, okay.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.788
It's really not fair, though.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.490
Why do you get to
see my tux but...

03:11.492 --> 03:12.925
- Hey.
- Are you gonna cry?

03:14.929 --> 03:17.296
Remember when we were like that?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.764
Hey, we still are.

03:23.337 --> 03:27.239
Now the student should
never dishonor his teacher.

03:33.981 --> 03:34.981
Hmm.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.321
Hmm.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.392
Mm, ah, yeah,
that's a great move.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.335
Oh, even better.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.306
It's getting worse.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.743
Cities, all due to the collapse

04:04.745 --> 04:06.345
of the dollar, and
the panic, looting,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.580
and governmental
chaos that followed.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.449
The National Guard
and local responders

04:10.451 --> 04:12.618
are overwhelmed in the
bigger metropolitan areas.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.619
Smaller towns and rural

04:13.621 --> 04:15.454
I can't concentrate.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.329
Is Eli spanking
you at chess again?

04:24.331 --> 04:27.032
No, Eli is not spanking
me at chess again.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.967
Mom said it's party
time, Birthday Boy.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.621
Jimmy?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.623
I'm coming.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.693
Perfect storm, the mass layoffs

04:54.695 --> 04:57.429
at the Zanesville plant which
sparked riots over the weekend

04:57.431 --> 04:59.464
escalated sharply this morning.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.786
Police are advising people to
stay in for their own health.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.485
Oh, I wanted that.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.021
Okay, what's it gonna
be, cake or presents?

05:23.023 --> 05:24.756
- Presents!
- Presents!

05:24.758 --> 05:25.924
- Presents!
- Presents!

05:25.926 --> 05:27.759
- Presents.
- Presents, it is.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.593
I'm starting first.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.728
Here ya go.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.962
Ooh! Whoa!

05:30.964 --> 05:32.064
Happy birthday, son.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.098
Oh!

05:36.804 --> 05:37.903
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

05:41.442 --> 05:42.941
How could you get him that?

05:46.747 --> 05:47.813
You knew about this?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.616
I'm sorry, I didn't get a
chance to talk to her about it.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.518
Well, how could, ah.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.020
Sophie, please don't
ruin this for Jimmy.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.523
Look, we are gonna be
safe, Sophie, all right?

05:58.525 --> 05:59.958
Safety lessons first. Yeah?

05:59.960 --> 06:02.461
You know I'm a better shot
than you anyways, Dad.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.862
On their birthday, no less.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.509
What do you say
we go to the range

06:17.511 --> 06:18.510
and shoot this thing, huh?

06:18.512 --> 06:20.078
I wanna come.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.013
No, no, no, it's just Jimmy
and Adam today, okay, buddy?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.515
Okay.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.583
All right, well,
we'll go into town

06:24.585 --> 06:25.817
and pick up some
ammo on the way.

06:25.819 --> 06:26.852
Come on, let's go.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.120
It'll be fun.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.122
Love you.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.124
Bye.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.160
Have fun.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.895
More cake for us.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.497
Oh yeah.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.853
On his 21st birthday?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.156
Sophie, you humiliated him.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.804
I'm sorry I didn't warn you.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.510
You know how your
father can be sometimes.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.900
Sometimes he can't see
outside his own two rules.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.817
Be prepared.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.852
Mmhmm, and?

07:33.854 --> 07:34.719
That'll be fun.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.922
Yep.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.560
It'll never be boring being
hitched to men like ours.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.281
That's for sure.

07:46.282 --> 07:47.322
Sometimes I prefer boring.

07:50.938 --> 07:51.938
Mm.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.940
How in the world did
you get through this, Mom?

08:01.682 --> 08:02.714
We all miss Becca.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.053
But no one as much as Jimmy.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.871
Why can't I let things go?

08:35.148 --> 08:37.215
You just want to
protect the ones you love.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.624
Come on.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.792
Buttercream frosting
is calling our names.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.162
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:01.942 --> 09:05.110
So, what was that about?

09:06.280 --> 09:09.714
I'm sorry that happened, Adam.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.250
Let's just say that
forgiving and forgetting

09:12.252 --> 09:14.185
isn't one of Sophie's
strong points.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.720
You can say that again.

09:15.722 --> 09:16.821
- Jimmy?
- What?

09:16.823 --> 09:17.823
It's true.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.893
Marriage isn't
always gonna be easy.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.695
There are gonna be
moments that you wonder

09:23.697 --> 09:25.630
why you chose Sophie, and, well,

09:25.632 --> 09:27.899
she's gonna wonder
why she chose you.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.235
When you reach that point,
just remember your vows.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.772
Yes sir, for
better or for worse.

09:35.642 --> 09:39.077
Love is a, it's a sacrifice.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.013
It's laying down
your life for her.

09:44.685 --> 09:49.688
Oh, and I'm really
sorry that she decided

09:49.690 --> 09:51.089
to postpone the wedding
for a year.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.827
Well, wait, what?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.696
She didn't tell you?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.231
Ah.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.233
Sorry.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.273
Look.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.309
I'm just kidding.

10:13.780 --> 10:18.717
Oh, man, oh, oh!

10:19.920 --> 10:20.986
You were in on it too.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.322
Okay, okay, I see how it is.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:30.764 --> 10:32.484
So much for chaos staying
in the big cities.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.633
Well, they look peaceful.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.135
Let's hope they stay that way.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.043
There you go.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.045
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.749
Keep 'em out, Chuck.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.884
Our credit card machine's down.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.252
It's been down all day.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.689
Let us in!

10:57.691 --> 10:59.357
I'm sorry, we're
closing early today.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.027
Last sale, get the
weapons in the safe now.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.896
Please leave peacefully and
quietly out the back doors.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.898
Stay safe.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.001
We can't hold 'em!

11:10.003 --> 11:11.069
Cash to my office now.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.103
Okay.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.972
Look out!

11:24.151 --> 11:25.717
No, hey, let go!

11:29.089 --> 11:31.890
Protect the people,
not the property, Tim.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.892
Come on, let's go!

11:37.798 --> 11:39.230
Go, go, go!

11:39.232 --> 11:40.232
Hey!

11:49.409 --> 11:50.475
Hey!

11:52.379 --> 11:54.779
Leave us alone!

11:55.782 --> 11:56.782
Back off!

11:58.285 --> 11:59.918
You help Jimmy.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.252
Jimmy!

12:01.254 --> 12:02.120
I said back off!

12:02.122 --> 12:03.955
- I got him.
- Hey!

12:13.467 --> 12:14.467
Come on, come on!

12:16.470 --> 12:17.970
Hey!

12:17.971 --> 12:19.471
Who are you kidding?
You can't shoot us all!

12:19.473 --> 12:21.039
You really want
to take that chance?

12:22.342 --> 12:23.408
You ain't goin' anywhere!

12:23.410 --> 12:24.943
You're mine!

12:24.945 --> 12:26.978
Give it to me,
come on, give it to me!

12:26.980 --> 12:29.013
Uh-oh.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.419
Hold on!

12:45.065 --> 12:46.798
All right, come
on, Liz, pick up.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.868
Pick up!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.280
What's happening?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.015
Downtown's under attack,
people are getting killed.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.584
Are you hurt?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.152
No, I'm fine, I'm fine,
but we have to get outta here.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.070
Dad, what happened?

13:08.071 --> 13:08.987
He got knocked out.

13:08.988 --> 13:09.904
Look, we'll talk about it later.

13:09.905 --> 13:10.821
Right now, we need to leave.

13:10.824 --> 13:11.923
Leave?

13:11.925 --> 13:12.991
The whole town's on fire.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.026
The police are retreating.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.796
Go get him an ice pack
and some Ibuprofen, now.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.063
Okay, okay.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.165
Whose blood is in the back seat?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.133
What?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.100
It's someone we tried to help.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.468
Now listen to me very carefully.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.969
We have prepared for this.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.571
We will survive, but right now,

13:26.573 --> 13:28.339
we have to pack
and get outta here.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.941
How long are we gonna be gone?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.476
What?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.511
I'm supposed to be getting
married in 39 days, Dad.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.246
Sophie, have you
heard a word I've said?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.515
People are dying
just two miles away.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.484
My priority is to
keep you all safe.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.085
- Safe?
- Yes, safe.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.155
Adam, do you want
to stay with us

13:44.157 --> 13:46.524
until your family
gets back in town?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.127
All right, all right,
guys, we've prepared.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.462
Let's go, let's do this,
let's pack it up, let's go!

13:54.100 --> 13:56.534
Hey, Honey, have you seen
the key to the gun safe?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.002
It should be in your drawer.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.270
No, it's not there.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.471
Get everyone in the car!

14:00.473 --> 14:02.006
Can I go back
inside and get my box?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.191
No, bugout gear only.

14:03.192 --> 14:04.375
- Dad, but it's my...
- I said no!

14:04.377 --> 14:06.878
Do you know where the bronze
key to the gun safe is?

14:06.880 --> 14:07.880
No.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.550
Honey.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.053
Honey, can we just stay here?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.354
Maybe we're overreacting just a-

14:19.092 --> 14:20.959
That was in our neighborhood.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.594
Get everyone in the car.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.029
Eli, move it, time to leave.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.143
Where's Jimmy?

14:39.145 --> 14:40.278
Jimmy!

14:44.885 --> 14:46.284
Go, go, go!

14:46.286 --> 14:48.052
Adam, grab that rifle.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.355
Shells are in the trailer.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.264
We will defend ourselves!

15:02.135 --> 15:04.302
Sophie, take the kids
and get outta here!

15:04.304 --> 15:07.338
What?

15:07.340 --> 15:08.640
You guys, go, go, go, go!

15:08.642 --> 15:09.507
Stay low!

15:09.509 --> 15:10.975
Eli, stay low.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.244
Get off my property, now!

15:16.449 --> 15:18.650
All right, Doc.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.953
Time for you to feel my pain.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.291
There are kids here.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.293
Where are ya?

15:32.132 --> 15:33.132
Show yourself.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.309
What, what?

15:45.412 --> 15:49.614
Faith?

15:49.616 --> 15:54.385
That can't be.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.525
No dead kids, Clint,
just the doctor.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.004
Daddy!

16:13.006 --> 16:15.707
Sophie, go, go, get outta here!

16:36.763 --> 16:37.763
Dad!

16:46.773 --> 16:48.506
Hey!

16:51.745 --> 16:53.411
Sophie, get to the woods.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.679
- Jimmy, go!
- Okay.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.114
We'll meet you there!

16:56.116 --> 16:57.382
Girls, grab a bag.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.152
Adam, I have to find that key.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.422
Come on, Sophie!

17:04.424 --> 17:05.723
Not without Adam.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.228
Faith!

17:10.396 --> 17:11.695
No!

17:11.698 --> 17:12.696
Why, I just told you...

17:12.699 --> 17:13.564
It wasn't me!

17:13.566 --> 17:14.665
I said, it wasn't me!

17:19.705 --> 17:21.071
Don't be going all tender on us.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.507
This was your idea.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.044
She's gonna die anyway.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.046
Come on.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.415
Take care of 'em, Soph.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.324
Run!

18:04.484 --> 18:05.716
Jack!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.118
Hey Jack, found me a wife.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.620
Get off of me!

18:12.192 --> 18:13.491
Oh, no, no, no.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.130
Sit down.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.776
Why are you doing this to us?

18:33.646 --> 18:34.712
It's vengeance.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.550
Easy, easy.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.587
But it's over now.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.228
The world is falling apart.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.767
Believe me, I need
to save those kids,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.872
though I'm only gonna
offer this once.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.345
Help me save her.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.783
You can't have her.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.621
Fine, we're done.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.490
You can't have her!

19:19.492 --> 19:20.391
You hear me?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.759
You can't have her!

19:34.374 --> 19:36.641
So, you can help-

19:38.511 --> 19:40.178
or you could hurt.

20:05.905 --> 20:06.905
Hmm.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.689
He's your problem now.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.459
Oh, one more thing.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.998
If I don't find her
alive, I'm gonna find you.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.868
How's that for tender?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.532
Eli, come on, get up.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.018
You don't have
to hide it from me.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.055
What?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.358
You've stared at that
thing every spare second

22:07.360 --> 22:11.095
for the past month, whenever
you think no one's looking.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.102
Has it really been a month?

22:20.873 --> 22:22.840
You can talk to
me, you know that?

22:28.348 --> 22:29.348
It's your turn.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.051
Mommy.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.823
Shh.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.366
Mommy!

22:48.368 --> 22:49.734
Mommy, no!

22:49.736 --> 22:51.602
Look, you have got
keep Faith more quiet.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.605
Look, she's been
whining all night long.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.608
Have a heart, Jimmy.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.977
Her wound is infected
and she misses Mom.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.379
You shouldn't have
gone back into the house

23:01.381 --> 23:02.847
to get your stupid ole' sword.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.715
We could have got out in time.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.017
I told you that Dad
said that I could go back.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.719
Please keep your voice down.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.722
No, you went back inside
to get your dumb toy sword

23:11.724 --> 23:14.158
and your little trinkets
when his last words were

23:14.160 --> 23:16.761
for everybody to get
in the car and leave.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.496
You think you miss
him more than me?

23:25.805 --> 23:27.872
I'll take the lookout.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.540
But you did it last night.

23:31.477 --> 23:32.810
How are you gonna stay awake?

23:39.419 --> 23:40.419
Let it go, Soph.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.425
We are still a family.

23:48.027 --> 23:48.993
Yep.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.830
Mommy.

24:36.509 --> 24:40.711
Good morning, sleepyhead.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.979
That's what Mom

24:41.981 --> 24:43.647
used to say to me
when I'd sleep in.

24:47.887 --> 24:48.887
Scooch.

24:58.130 --> 25:02.166
Six berries and one piece
of jerky for each of us.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.534
Here, bud.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.002
These berries are sour.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.204
Eli, you're always
wanting what we don't have.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.205
Be thankful and try it.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.807
It's not that bad.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.781
Don't spit that out.

25:19.285 --> 25:23.988
Eli, when God made the first
deer, He said, "It is good."

25:24.690 --> 25:26.123
That was before
Adam and Eve sinned.

25:27.026 --> 25:27.992
Now it's disgusting.

25:27.994 --> 25:28.994
I hate it.

25:30.296 --> 25:34.932
In everything, give thanks,
for this is the will of God.

25:34.934 --> 25:35.934
Think so, huh?

25:37.537 --> 25:40.104
You think God wants us to
give thanks for everything?

25:40.106 --> 25:41.939
What about stinging nettles?

25:41.941 --> 25:43.307
I'll get you some jewel weed.

25:45.278 --> 25:48.012
It's not for
everything give thanks,

25:49.115 --> 25:51.248
"In everything, give thanks."

25:51.250 --> 25:52.250
Yeah.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.753
God, thank you so much
for thinkin' of us

25:55.755 --> 26:00.724
and for thinkin' of
Faith, whom You could cure

26:00.726 --> 26:02.259
with a snap of Your
fingers like that.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.835
Grows right next
to stingin' nettles.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.971
Ain't that just like God?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.047
I saw two flashlights
on that hill last night.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.584
There's been no
gunfire for two days.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.052
Maybe the looters couldn't
break into the gun safe.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.987
Well, how can we get
in without the key?

26:31.290 --> 26:34.224
No way, we are not
going back there.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.160
Did you hear what I said?

26:36.162 --> 26:38.729
No gunfire for two
days, we're fine.

26:43.970 --> 26:44.970
Her fever's back.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.238
We really need an
antibiotic for her.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.240
Dad kept some in
the house, right?

26:50.242 --> 26:53.210
We could use a bigger
pan to boil water.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.914
Clothes, towels, anything
for a bandage for Faith.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.353
We need to bury Mom and Dad.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.193
Stay here.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.217
Maybe the horses got out.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.379
Yeah, right.

28:12.425 --> 28:13.425
Let's go.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.701
Okay, here we go.

28:40.886 --> 28:41.886
Adam.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.996
Ugh, what is that smell?

28:52.998 --> 28:54.364
Shh, stay close.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.244
Did you hear that?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.378
No.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.250
Ah!

29:46.018 --> 29:47.284
It's a skunk.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.052
You about
gave me a heart attack.

29:49.054 --> 29:50.054
Come on.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.068
Okay, you go check
the basement first.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.138
I need to go upstairs
and look for something.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.374
Sophie, we need
to stay together.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.237
You hid the key to the gun safe?

30:42.975 --> 30:43.974
How dare you.

30:43.976 --> 30:47.177
I am so sorry.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.103
Ew.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.606
Watch your step.

31:15.608 --> 31:17.274
No, you watch your step.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.989
It's not Adam.

31:31.991 --> 31:32.991
Calm down, Soph.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.299
Ah.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.467
What is that?

31:43.469 --> 31:46.904
Shoo, go on.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.341
Here, hold the light.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.561
Oh, I can't believe it.

32:15.701 --> 32:16.701
Nice.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.207
Look, why don't
we just stay here?

32:24.209 --> 32:25.642
We'll clean the place up.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.677
We'll bury the dead guy.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.145
They'll be back.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.080
We can defend
ourselves now, Sophie.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.649
We don't have water, Jimmy.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.718
They will starve us
out or burn us down.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.986
It's our home!

32:35.988 --> 32:38.956
Dad died fighting for it.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.257
We should be willing to.

32:40.259 --> 32:43.193
Dad didn't die
fighting for our home.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.228
He died fighting for us.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.697
Handicapped, thanks to you.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.432
Okay.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.501
I am sick of hiding and
eating berries and bugs, Sophie.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.203
Don't you wanna fight?

32:53.205 --> 32:56.440
If we die, who's gonna
take care of Eli and Faith?

33:23.502 --> 33:25.068
Mom and Adam aren't here.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.472
Well, they could still be alive.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.108
Well, I wouldn't
be too happy about that.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.076
Don't you dare talk
like that around Faith.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.179
You know, some things
are worse than death.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.627
People are coming.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.031
It's Robby.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.334
Wait, we don't
know who he's with.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.368
It's Robby, Sophie.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.039
Robby!

34:02.041 --> 34:03.041
Jimmy.

34:04.109 --> 34:05.275
Man, I can't believe
you guys made it.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.643
Hey, this is my
buddy, Chris, okay?

34:06.645 --> 34:09.413
Well, come in and
keep your voices down.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.614
Looters have been living here
and they may be returning.

34:17.322 --> 34:22.259
Sophie! Adam!

34:23.128 --> 34:24.226
Oh, thank God!

34:25.731 --> 34:27.431
You're all right.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.498
So are you.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.301
You're alive.

34:38.710 --> 34:42.344
Sophie, I'm so
sorry about your dad.

34:46.685 --> 34:47.685
Who's he?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.820
Robby?

34:49.822 --> 34:51.353
Look, Jimmy,
just calm down, okay?

34:51.356 --> 34:52.722
He's with me.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.463
Is Mom all right?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.265
I don't know what
happened to her.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.236
I ran out of ammo
and they took us.

35:06.238 --> 35:06.870
Who took her?

35:06.872 --> 35:07.872
Where?

35:09.641 --> 35:11.108
We'll find her.

35:11.110 --> 35:11.875
Robby has an idea.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.277
All right, take us to her.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.580
Look, y'all don't
understand, okay?

35:17.883 --> 35:19.683
You don't know what
it's like out there.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.685
Try me.

35:23.889 --> 35:24.889
Like that.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.227
Everywhere.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.296
What is the government doing?

35:33.298 --> 35:34.531
Are there any police?

35:40.706 --> 35:42.572
Oh no, are you injured?

35:47.513 --> 35:48.513
Adam, what happened?

35:50.282 --> 35:51.548
What you got
down in the duffle bag?

35:51.550 --> 35:53.467
Hey, get your hands off!

35:53.468 --> 35:55.385
And no you can't have
any so don't even ask.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.570
Whose blood is this?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.510
Adam, what's going on?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.212
Don't judge us.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.649
Our parents were
killed just like yours.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.218
Okay, we have to do what
we have to do to survive.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.352
Are you hurting people?

36:31.657 --> 36:33.256
You aiming that
weapon at me, boy?

36:33.258 --> 36:34.424
- Yeah.
- Hey, Clint, look!

36:34.426 --> 36:35.759
These are my friends, okay?

36:37.396 --> 36:41.298
Look, everybody just
needs to calm down, okay?

36:41.300 --> 36:43.833
Jimmy, calm down.

36:47.873 --> 36:48.873
Is that Charlie?

36:51.376 --> 36:53.243
Look, Adam, come on, let's go.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.579
No, I'm not leaving.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.515
Let me borrow your shotgun.

36:58.517 --> 36:59.517
No way.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.420
Here, I want it back.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.463
Good luck.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.003
Does that nasty hat look
familiar to you, Soph?

37:20.005 --> 37:23.773
What caliber
is that rifle over there?

37:25.677 --> 37:27.544
Fetch that rifle
on the island for me.

37:33.785 --> 37:34.918
I got a
feeling you ain't meaning

37:34.920 --> 37:36.519
to show it to me
in a friendly way.

37:36.521 --> 37:37.721
Well, I got to
feeling this ain't

37:37.723 --> 37:39.923
the first time you've
been to my house.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.435
Adam, what's going on up there?

37:52.437 --> 37:54.437
Adam!

37:54.439 --> 37:58.275
Come on, let me in!

38:00.712 --> 38:02.279
No, you'll shoot Adam!

38:04.516 --> 38:05.982
Adam! Robby!

38:05.984 --> 38:07.550
He ain't gonna make it, Robby!

38:10.856 --> 38:12.555
Robby, help!

38:12.557 --> 38:14.324
I'm trying!

38:15.427 --> 38:17.294
Adam, just open the door!

38:17.296 --> 38:19.329
Time to die, boy.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.332
Ah!

38:29.975 --> 38:32.309
Adam, hurry, come on!

38:33.612 --> 38:34.612
Adam!

39:00.505 --> 39:01.805
Hey, get away from him!

39:01.807 --> 39:04.741
Robby! I'll kill you!

39:18.757 --> 39:23.693
Yep, whooped him.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.496
Adam.

39:31.770 --> 39:32.836
Took you long enough.

39:34.373 --> 39:35.373
Who was it?

39:37.042 --> 39:39.776
Hey, can you doctor that?

39:43.682 --> 39:45.548
Put pressure on it,
put pressure on it.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.016
Lemme give 'em some food, Robby.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.552
They're hungry.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.754
We don't want your food,

39:52.090 --> 39:53.790
not if it has
innocent blood on it.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.694
So you'd rather starve to death?

39:57.696 --> 39:58.828
Than murder and steal?

39:59.731 --> 40:01.064
Yeah.

40:02.801 --> 40:05.668
We only kill those who've
killed to steal from others.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.506
Except that, uh, that
little boy you shot.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.712
That boy wasn't so little,

40:15.714 --> 40:17.046
and he was coming
at me with a knife.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.615
It was self-defense.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.151
When you're robbing
someone, you don't have

40:21.153 --> 40:23.586
the right to shoot them
in self-defense, Adam.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.556
Thanks, moron.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.661
Look, Soph, your
little family dream

40:31.663 --> 40:36.099
of three meals a day and
kids and bedtime prayers

40:36.101 --> 40:38.802
and that rose-decorated
wedding at the country club?

40:40.839 --> 40:42.572
Soph, it's over.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.443
Welcome to our worst nightmare.

40:47.446 --> 40:48.478
It's adapt or die.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.915
You adapt by trusting in God,

40:53.485 --> 40:56.853
not by theft and violence.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.455
Did trusting God save your dad?

40:59.724 --> 41:01.090
Is trusting in God
getting you fed?

41:01.092 --> 41:02.092
We're not starving.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.229
Yet.

41:06.230 --> 41:07.596
Jimmy, come eat with us.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.501
You've changed, Robby.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.569
I've grown up, Soph.

41:13.839 --> 41:15.772
Maybe if you'd trade
that gavel for a fork,

41:17.008 --> 41:18.775
you might live long
enough to grow up, too.

41:21.780 --> 41:22.912
Grow up somewhere else.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.883
Sophie's right, Robby.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.985
We've got blood on our hands.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.988
Shut up, ya little girl.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.690
Adam's not going anywhere.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.558
He's gonna have to stay
here 'til he gets better,

41:35.560 --> 41:36.793
or at least 'til
he stops bleeding.

41:36.795 --> 41:37.760
Is that all right?

41:37.762 --> 41:40.797
No, that's not all right!

41:40.799 --> 41:42.098
Leave!

41:42.100 --> 41:43.666
He got cut defending
you all, you know.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.734
He didn't have to.

41:47.906 --> 41:50.173
Let me leave food for them
in the mailbox in a week.

41:51.710 --> 41:56.513
Pathetic, you're all pathetic.

42:00.619 --> 42:01.619
Move!

42:04.589 --> 42:06.556
We'll tend to him
until he's on his feet.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.293
Then he's outta here.

42:10.295 --> 42:14.631
Look, y'all are more
than welcome to join us.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.944
You know where to find us.

42:29.814 --> 42:31.281
Bring your guns
and your appetite.

42:34.019 --> 42:36.920
Hey, you'd better
watch out for Clint.

43:24.836 --> 43:28.838
I wish, I wish someone
would say something nice.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.109
Dad's happy.

43:36.247 --> 43:38.081
Rejoice with those
who rejoice, right?

43:42.387 --> 43:44.287
Dad's not looking up at us.

43:46.758 --> 43:47.924
He's looking down on us.

43:52.897 --> 43:54.330
He wouldn't want
us sad for long.

44:02.407 --> 44:07.176
When our old green go-kart
broke, were you sad?

44:07.979 --> 44:10.279
Not really, no.

44:10.882 --> 44:11.882
Why?

44:13.752 --> 44:15.952
Because we knew Dad was
gonna buy us a new one.

44:22.994 --> 44:26.162
With Dad, everything
is brand new now.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.803
If he could tell us one thing,

44:35.774 --> 44:37.340
he would tell us that
God is still good.

45:33.732 --> 45:36.132
It's okay to cry.

46:08.299 --> 46:09.465
Jesus told his disciples to buy

46:09.467 --> 46:12.135
a sword just for selfdefense.

46:12.137 --> 46:13.770
Two of 'em.

46:13.772 --> 46:14.971
I just don't understand

46:14.973 --> 46:16.405
your aversion to
defending yourself.

46:19.177 --> 46:24.113
I am against killing
people, and guns kill people.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.215
And that's why the bad guys

46:26.217 --> 46:27.850
shouldn't be the only
ones to have 'em.

46:27.852 --> 46:31.487
It is not murder to kill
someone in self-defense.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.055
You're being stricter than God.

46:37.362 --> 46:39.328
And it wasn't up to you anyway

46:39.330 --> 46:41.998
because Dad was looking for
that key and you stole it.

46:43.001 --> 46:44.467
I was gonna give it back.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.435
Yeah, well, it's a little
late, don't you think?

46:50.275 --> 46:52.942
Aren't you glad I'll be
in the lookout with this?

46:55.113 --> 46:56.479
Or would you rather
us be defenseless

46:56.481 --> 46:58.014
against the predators?

47:03.588 --> 47:06.255
I'm sorry, all right?

47:09.060 --> 47:13.196
Please, forgive me AnnaLee.

47:23.141 --> 47:24.507
Of course I forgive you.

47:25.944 --> 47:26.944
Now get some sleep.

47:36.588 --> 47:37.588
Sophie?

47:39.891 --> 47:42.158
Why am I shivering?

47:42.160 --> 47:46.629
Because your fever's breaking,
or maybe it's withdrawals.

47:50.935 --> 47:54.270
Can I have
some of the antibiotic?

47:56.007 --> 47:59.375
That's for Faith, and we
barely have enough for her.

48:03.147 --> 48:05.581
Sorry, that was selfish of me.

48:35.313 --> 48:37.947
All right, give me the spear.

48:41.286 --> 48:42.585
I want both of you
to drive any deer

48:42.587 --> 48:44.120
you see up to the ravine, okay?

48:46.624 --> 48:48.424
Why don't you just shoot 'em?

48:48.426 --> 48:50.159
Well, we got to save our
ammo in case any bad guys

48:50.161 --> 48:52.295
come around, and we're
too close to town.

48:52.297 --> 48:53.529
So I'm gonna crawl
up on this log

48:53.531 --> 48:55.081
and perch up, and like I said,

48:55.082 --> 48:56.882
if you see anything,
drive 'em this way, okay?

49:31.436 --> 49:33.069
Oh, oh my, yes!

49:33.071 --> 49:34.070
Yeah, right?

49:34.072 --> 49:35.271
Woo!

49:35.273 --> 49:37.239
Woo, we're eatin' tonight!

49:46.584 --> 49:48.150
Thank you, Jimmy.

49:48.152 --> 49:50.619
Thank you, Jimmy, so much.
Thank you.

49:53.391 --> 49:54.357
It's really good, right?

49:54.359 --> 49:55.624
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

49:55.626 --> 49:56.659
You know what?

49:58.196 --> 50:01.597
I think this deserves
a toast, mm-hmm.

50:01.599 --> 50:02.599
Oh.

50:04.302 --> 50:06.102
- Go on.
- Ready?

50:06.104 --> 50:07.003
To luxury.

50:07.005 --> 50:08.504
To luxury!

50:08.506 --> 50:09.772
- Woo-hoo!
- Woo!

50:09.774 --> 50:12.074
That was the
best meal we've had.

50:12.076 --> 50:14.243
For once, the kids
won't go to bed hungry.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.245
Thank God.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.584
I see you're getting more
comfortable with guns.

50:21.586 --> 50:22.718
Only because I have to.

50:26.024 --> 50:27.024
And with me.

50:32.530 --> 50:33.530
Sophie, I...

50:36.367 --> 50:38.334
You know I still feel
the same way about you.

50:43.708 --> 50:45.408
You're still wearing the
ring, which means you haven't

50:45.410 --> 50:50.179
completely given up
on us, our dreams.

50:52.150 --> 50:56.685
My dream, Adam, was to marry

50:56.687 --> 51:01.090
a man who would be a good
husband, a good father.

51:01.092 --> 51:02.591
I know, I know.

51:02.593 --> 51:06.095
A man who would do good
when no one was looking,

51:06.097 --> 51:09.532
not a murderer, not a thief.

51:09.534 --> 51:11.767
Joining Robby was the
best chance I had of finding

51:11.769 --> 51:14.837
your mom, the best
chance, Sophie.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.775
And we were starving.

51:24.348 --> 51:26.515
I'm not justifying what I did.

51:30.188 --> 51:31.188
I'm sorry.

51:33.391 --> 51:34.490
What else can I do?

51:44.802 --> 51:46.368
You know what today
is, don't you?

51:58.382 --> 51:59.081
It's the day

51:59.082 --> 52:00.202
I would've seen you in this.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.160
Sophie.

52:12.830 --> 52:15.731
Just-give me another chance.

52:19.270 --> 52:20.270
Please.

53:22.433 --> 53:26.302
I don't know how to
let go, Daddy.

53:40.384 --> 53:45.321
I miss you so much.

54:07.778 --> 54:08.778
Tell Becca...

54:12.650 --> 54:16.518
Tell Becca that I miss her, too.

54:27.632 --> 54:29.531
Sophie, I found something.

54:31.535 --> 54:33.502
Oh yeah, it's a pendant.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.541
It's got the letter Y.

54:41.045 --> 54:43.712
You because it's my gift to you.

54:45.850 --> 54:47.349
Junk, Faith.

54:48.786 --> 54:52.288
If anything, all these luxuries
are a waste of our time.

54:52.290 --> 54:53.422
They're not keepin' us alive.

54:53.424 --> 54:54.690
Like your box?

54:54.692 --> 54:56.425
Don't hurt his feelings, Sophie.

55:05.436 --> 55:06.635
Well, nice shootin', Tex.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.771
We'd starve to death
on your lousy aim.

55:08.773 --> 55:11.540
You didn't hit one.

55:11.542 --> 55:12.574
Must be bad ammo.

55:12.576 --> 55:13.842
Oh, bad ammo?

55:13.844 --> 55:15.544
Listen to him.

55:15.546 --> 55:17.046
I'm nearly out.

55:17.048 --> 55:20.582
Well, those kids
out there got guns and ammo,

55:20.584 --> 55:23.886
.308, 5.56, and I know he's got

55:23.888 --> 55:26.555
a camouflage Venture
with a high-end scope.

55:26.557 --> 55:28.057
- Yeah.
- Come on, man!

55:28.059 --> 55:29.658
Easy prey!

55:29.660 --> 55:30.793
Yeah, you're right.

55:32.596 --> 55:33.596
Sophie.

55:34.465 --> 55:36.465
If I tell you to go to Jimmy,

55:36.467 --> 55:37.700
you run and you don't look back.

55:37.702 --> 55:39.101
Do you understand me?

55:39.103 --> 55:40.869
Yes.

55:40.871 --> 55:41.871
Let's go.

55:45.509 --> 55:48.811
Hey, keep up.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.482
All right, now what is this?

55:53.484 --> 55:54.783
The safety?

55:54.785 --> 55:56.885
Safety, right, so when
you click that down,

55:58.522 --> 55:59.555
you're gonna see this red dot.

55:59.557 --> 56:00.856
Okay.

56:00.858 --> 56:01.924
Now, what's this?

56:03.060 --> 56:06.628
Um, it's the, um, the slide.

56:06.630 --> 56:07.963
Right.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.932
If the slide's back,
insert a fresh mag,

56:09.934 --> 56:11.367
and you're back in the fight.

56:11.369 --> 56:13.535
Frankie approached
the petting zoo.

56:13.537 --> 56:15.137
He watched goats
petting the people.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.541
He visited the chimps.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.844
They weren't grooming in
the way he had expected.

56:21.846 --> 56:24.747
They were giving manicures,
pedicures, and permanents.

56:25.783 --> 56:26.783
Look at his hair.

56:29.587 --> 56:32.988
I can't believe Robby
would turn on you like that.

56:32.990 --> 56:35.157
I smelled the alcohol
on him from 20 feet away.

56:36.594 --> 56:38.026
He had that guy
that was with you

56:38.028 --> 56:41.530
when you came to the house,
the fellow with the cowboy hat.

56:43.501 --> 56:46.635
Ah, he's a bad
dude, no conscience.

56:49.173 --> 56:50.939
Did he attack us
on that first day?

56:52.843 --> 56:56.779
Mm, after they
beat me senseless,

56:56.781 --> 56:57.980
he still wanted to kill me,

57:00.518 --> 57:02.117
hang me from the
tree over your dad.

57:05.022 --> 57:07.022
Robby came along just
in time to save me.

57:13.431 --> 57:15.831
No, I take that back.

57:17.635 --> 57:19.768
Robby was just
killing me slower.

57:22.206 --> 57:24.173
Glad you finally came
to grips with that.

57:30.147 --> 57:32.514
All right, I want you to put
your finger on the trigger,

57:32.516 --> 57:34.516
pull it back very
slowly while keeping

57:34.518 --> 57:36.685
your sights fixed on the heart.

57:36.687 --> 57:37.687
All right.

57:38.622 --> 57:40.189
Can I just shoot his leg?

57:40.191 --> 57:43.559
No, you shoot to kill
or you don't shoot.

57:43.561 --> 57:47.763
You shoot to defend, but
shooting the leg of an armed man

57:47.765 --> 57:49.898
isn't a very good way to defend.

57:49.900 --> 57:52.034
Yeah, that's what
I was gonna say.

57:54.238 --> 57:55.604
I'm gonna go for a walk.

57:56.974 --> 58:00.509
Hey, at least
bring a gun with you.

58:05.950 --> 58:08.851
Oh, you are armed and dangerous.

58:08.853 --> 58:10.619
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

58:10.621 --> 58:13.922
Whoa!

58:13.924 --> 58:16.124
All right, take
it off safety first,

58:17.161 --> 58:18.694
pull the trigger very slowly.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.496
You keep your sights
fixed on the heart.

58:20.498 --> 58:21.597
Okay.

58:21.599 --> 58:22.599
Now shoot him.

58:24.768 --> 58:26.668
You got to take it off safety.

58:26.670 --> 58:27.636
Whoops.

58:27.638 --> 58:28.937
Eli, you can't forget.

58:30.908 --> 58:32.975
Finger off the trigger,
hand it to me safely.

58:46.023 --> 58:49.024
Eli, it's a BarrelBuddy,
once and done, kiddo.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.026
Oh, okay.

58:50.995 --> 58:51.995
Here you go.

59:01.739 --> 59:02.739
All right.

59:11.181 --> 59:13.181
You made that look easy.

59:13.183 --> 59:14.583
Hmm, you did pretty good.

59:15.686 --> 59:16.686
You know what, though?

59:18.222 --> 59:21.223
That right there is the most
beautiful sound in the world.

59:21.225 --> 59:24.159
No, the ding of a microwave

59:24.161 --> 59:26.261
when the popcorn just finished.

59:26.263 --> 59:27.930
Yeah, or a burp.

59:29.633 --> 59:32.134
After a rootbeer
float, it's awesome.

59:32.136 --> 59:34.770
"Amazing Grace" in
fourpart harmony,

59:34.772 --> 59:36.305
that's the most beautiful
sound in the world.

59:36.307 --> 59:38.240
Oh, you're so spiritual.

59:47.952 --> 59:49.217
Right?

59:49.219 --> 59:50.352
We could really
bust some bad guys

59:50.354 --> 59:52.054
with that kinda grace, huh?

59:52.056 --> 59:54.022
Enough foolishness, please.

59:54.024 --> 59:55.123
You know, speaking
of foolishness,

59:55.125 --> 59:56.191
I got a question for ya.

59:58.596 --> 01:00:01.029
When the looters run out of
food and wood for their heat,

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.898
where do you think
they're gonna go?

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.132
What's your point?

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:05.701
It's a mathematical equation.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:09.705
We can't stay here, we
don't have any food here.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:11.607
We've got more wire.

01:00:11.609 --> 01:00:13.709
We'll just set up more
traps further away.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.344
Yeah, well, what if the
crooks see one of my traps

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:17.613
and decide to wait
me out and ambush me?

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:19.781
Or worse, follow me back here?

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.184
Fact is, we can't garden and
we can't raise livestock.

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:24.019
We've got to keep
moving, that's a fact.

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:31.259
Well, what do you
think we should do?

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.928
No-brainer, we got to
meet up with Robby

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:34.062
in the city to find food.

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:36.398
No way, Robby is bad news.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.900
Those who live by the
sword will die by it.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:41.136
Precisely, and that's why
it's better to die fighting

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.305
than it is to die
slowly starving

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.907
or getting nabbed by,
like, an armed gang.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:47.476
Look, don't you want to catch

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.044
the people that did this to us?

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:50.712
Is that what this is about?

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:53.749
Punishing crimes is not our job.

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:54.750
It's the government's.

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:55.751
Look around you!

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:56.753
What government?

01:00:58.722 --> 01:00:59.388
Look, we got to go.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:00.922
Who's with me?

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:04.192
No, this is not a democracy.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:05.194
We're not splitting up.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.996
Adam said food from killing

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.132
and stealing was
worse than starving.

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:12.401
Yeah, that's easy to say
when you have a full stomach.

01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:13.969
Mom told us we should stay here,

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:15.070
so that's what we should do.

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:16.238
Mom is probably dead, Faith!

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.939
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:19.841
And our best chance of
finding her is with Robby!

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.209
Oh, all of the evil things

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.878
that are done in
the name of good.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:25.842
We are staying here.

01:01:26.984 --> 01:01:31.420
We are staying together,
and we are trusting God.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.650
Well, you can
trust God all you want.

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.326
Dad's the one who left
us supplies and weapons.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:40.863
Not God.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.198
Eli, let's go check the traps.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:56.445
What's the matter with him?

01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:59.281
Wish you would have been here.

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:02.398
He's hard to handle
when you're not around.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.255
Nice to be wanted again.

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:16.832
I don't know how
much more I can take.

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:19.167
God promises not to give us

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:21.103
more than we can handle, Sophia.

01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:23.472
I can't handle being around him.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:28.210
I mean, can't you
see that he's changed?

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.013
You've got to forgive.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:36.118
I can accept him as a brother.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:42.924
But not a fiance.

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:47.129
But you're not
accepting him as a brother

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:50.232
when you're holding
his past against him.

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:53.135
There's a difference
between forgiving someone

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:54.236
and trusting them.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:58.340
How can I ever trust him again?

01:02:58.342 --> 01:02:59.342
How?

01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:07.182
As soon as he's walking
better, he's got to go.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:56.165
Shoo!

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:05.040
AnnaLee, where'd
the bugout bags go?

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:09.010
Jimmy might have 'em.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.846
Both of them in the lookout?

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:13.416
So where's Adam?

01:04:38.976 --> 01:04:41.443
Jimmy, were you sleeping?

01:04:41.445 --> 01:04:42.477
No.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:44.246
Did you take the bugout bags?

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.248
No.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:47.416
Where's he been?

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:00.262
Adam, where have you been?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.166
Chris said he would leave
food for us, remember?

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:10.372
He didn't, but I think dawn
is the safest time to travel,

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:12.073
especially since I still
can't walk very well.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.042
You seem to be
walking just fine to me.

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.415
Are you saying that
it's just a coincidence

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.617
that our bags disappear
at the same time you did?

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.121
The bugout bags are missing?

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:28.323
Don't play that game with me.

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:29.658
What did you do with our bags?

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.465
Oh, Sophie, it
must be exhausting

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:40.035
dragging around a dead
corpse for old time's sake.

01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:42.237
Hey guys, come look at this.

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.338
Is this one of ours?

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.941
No way, that's like a size 15.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:47.008
Somebody's been here.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:48.945
Wait!

01:05:51.715 --> 01:05:53.315
No, no, no!

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:55.083
Are you okay?
What are you looking for?

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.353
Jimmy?

01:05:58.355 --> 01:05:59.354
No, no, no, no, no!

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:01.089
- What is it?
- My box!

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:06.995
Eli, AnnaLee, where is my box?

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:10.065
We lost half of our
ammo, most of our jerky,

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.467
a canteen, our wire
and our medical kit,

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.104
and you're whining about your
old coins and your trinkets.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.339
It was on your watch

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:18.740
so you have no one to
blame but yourself.

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:21.276
There was no moon, Sophie!
I couldn't see!

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:22.510
Well, then the thief
had a flashlight.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:24.079
How'd you miss that?

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:25.146
You all don't get it.

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:30.518
Right now, somebody
bad knows you're here.

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:34.222
You're going to have to move.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:36.458
Move?

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.625
Where?

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.194
I don't wanna move!

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.597
Mom says to stay here.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:44.566
Faith, we have
to move, all right?

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:47.535
Adam, do you mind
manning the lookout

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.471
while we pack everything up?

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:50.473
Of course.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:56.011
And I forgive you for
falsely accusing me.

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.451
Hey, don't forget
that fake limp.

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.673
So do you think Dad
would have prevented this

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:27.075
if he could've?

01:07:27.077 --> 01:07:28.443
Well, yeah, of course.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.414
Well, what about Becca's death?

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:35.050
Oh, Jimmy.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.418
Do you think he would have
saved her if he could've?

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.420
Yeah.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.288
Why do you think he
would've saved her?

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.523
'Cause he loved her.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:49.431
So tell me, Sophie, who's
more loving, Dad or God?

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:59.307
Jimmy, God is love, in spite
of our lack of understanding.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:00.642
Saying it doesn't prove it.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:02.644
I want to know how a loving God

01:08:02.646 --> 01:08:04.446
could let that happen to Becca.

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:07.482
Jesus came to save.

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:11.252
The devil, he kills and
he steals and he destroys.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.321
Do not blame God
for the devil's sin.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:14.856
Well, is God in control or not?

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:17.459
Look, you blame the
devil for everything,

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:19.594
but isn't he still
under God's control?

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.462
Tell me, Soph.

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:24.765
Who's to blame, the stick or
the hand holding the stick?

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.167
The hand holding the stick!

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:30.238
You blame me for all of
our stuff getting stolen

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.108
and accusing me
of falling asleep.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.509
Well, was God asleep?

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:35.844
Or how 'bout when Becca was...

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:41.716
Sorry, it was the gun's fault.

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:52.527
You guys should come sit.

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:55.598
Take a break.

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:38.273
I still believe
God is good, Jimmy.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.175
In spite of evidence
to the contrary?

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:44.946
You know, Soph, havin'
to blindly accept

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:47.314
the lack of any meaningful
explanation for our suffering,

01:09:47.317 --> 01:09:48.550
it just covers up incompetence.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.651
How could you say that?

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.654
I have a hard time
praying prayers

01:09:53.657 --> 01:09:57.959
that don't seem to come
to pass, but sometimes,

01:09:57.961 --> 01:10:02.830
the only good answer for
the question why is believe.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.532
It's a commandment,
it's not an answer.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.334
The command to
believe is the answer.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.969
It's a copout!

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.672
Trust in the Lord
with all of your heart

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:13.408
and lean not on your
own understanding.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.743
They're just words, that's it.

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.413
God's words are not just words.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.915
You can't eat 'em, you
can't load 'em into a gun

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:23.218
and shoot murderers with
'em, and you can't piece

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.420
a six-year-old's brains
back together with 'em.

01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.555
Man shall not live by
bread alone, but what?

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.591
- I need more than that!
- Every word of God.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:30.959
Sophie, I need more!

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:34.329
I need cold, hard facts
rooted in reality!

01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:37.365
Not empty words,
do you understand?

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:41.903
Look at me, hey.

01:10:44.307 --> 01:10:46.574
They're only empty words
if you don't believe them.

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:53.748
Faith is the substance
of things hoped for,

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:57.418
the evidence, the cold, hard
reality of things not seen.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:10:59.954
You want evidence of God's love?

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:02.725
Believe.

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:08.529
All because I ask the questions

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:11.399
everyone else is thinking
but they're afraid to ask.

01:11:11.401 --> 01:11:14.502
No, it's because you
don't want the answers.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:16.638
And because you're asking
all the wrong questions.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.573
Fine, what's the right question?

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:20.575
It's not why are
Dad and Becca dead?

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:24.445
It's why are we
sinners still alive?

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.060
We're losin' him.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:43.064
Jimmy, wait up.

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:49.124
Sophie.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.161
Finally, here we are.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:14:00.935
I have dreamed about
this day for so long.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:05.607
Do you love me?

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:13.548
I know I've let
you down, Sophie.

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:17.885
I may never be any more worthy
of you than I am of grace.

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.458
Can you love a man like that?

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:52.920
We all know what's next.

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:57.792
Adam, you may shake
the hand of your bride.

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.196
Aw, just kiss her, will ya?

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:04.131
Woo!

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:07.635
Jimmy.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:08.669
No!

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.142
No!

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:51.612
AnnaLee, someone's
shooting at Jimmy.

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:57.185
You got him!

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:00.555
- Don't move!
- Wait!

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:07.728
I said don't move!

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:08.730
Are you okay, Sophie?

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:10.299
I've got him.

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:12.267
Go check on Jimmy.

01:16:16.839 --> 01:16:18.706
Look out!

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.641
Help!

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:21.876
AnnaLee!

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:23.010
Don't fight me, girl.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:38.593
Hey you, behind the shelter!

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:42.630
Help AnnaLee!

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:57.145
Don't move!

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:04.853
Leave her alone!

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:14.395
AnnaLee!

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:16.664
Eli, you okay?

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.768
Oh, thank God.

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:29.377
Um, I remembered to take
it off the safety this time.

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:30.379
Adam! Good job.

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:34.348
Adam, are you all right?

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.889
Adam.

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:54.368
You're gonna be okay, Adam.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.070
You're gonna be okay.

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:57.338
Soph, let him rest.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:17:59.841
It's all we can do.

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:15.890
Sophie, come look at this, now.

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:21.829
This was at our house.

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:22.831
You were there.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.335
Let me tell you something.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:29.870
I should kill you right now.

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:42.783
That belongs to my sister.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:45.087
Look!

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:48.789
Just let me kill him!

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:51.726
No, Jimmy, we're not
just gonna kill somebody!

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:52.460
What are we gonna do, Sophie?

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:54.395
Are you gonna call the police?

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.896
'Cause if we let him go,

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.378
he's gonna come back
here and kill us.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:12.981
It's not here.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.416
Jimmy!

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:16.951
Where's the lock of hair?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.287
What?

01:19:20.289 --> 01:19:22.823
Where is the lock
of blonde hair?

01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:26.894
I thought it was junk.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:31.265
No, Jimmy, no, no, Jimmy!

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.000
Leave me alone, Sophie!

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.235
Leave me alone!

01:19:34.237 --> 01:19:35.803
Jimmy, what He deserves to die!

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.138
What lock of hair?

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:49.950
It was Becca's, all right?

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.085
It was Becca's.

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:56.490
Becca?

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:57.858
Don't tell, Jimmy.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.161
Stop, let me.

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:01.163
I'll fix it.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:06.567
It's better now.

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:14.508
I'll get you a hat and
put back the scissors.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.864
No, Jimmy.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.233
Jimmy?

01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:40.601
No!

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.303
What?

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.439
Oh God, oh God, no,
no, no, Jimmy, Jimmy!

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.007
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.375
- Jimmy, what did you do?
- No, Becca!

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:51.445
Becca!

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:52.513
Becca!

01:21:12.335 --> 01:21:14.468
We have to learn
to forgive ourselves.

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:18.572
You were an innocent little boy.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.311
No.

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:26.447
- Yes.
- It's not true, no.

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:28.282
- Not your fault.
- No.

01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:31.318
Then who is responsible, Sophie?

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.553
Who is responsible for it?

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:34.889
Do you know whose fault this is?

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:36.257
It's God!

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:38.125
God is responsible!

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:39.660
It's God's fault!

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:41.128
That's who!

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:45.399
Jimmy, Becca never
belonged to us.

01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:50.571
And God didn't cheat us by
taking her to Heaven early.

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:53.474
I'm killin' him.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:54.975
Stop! I'm killin' him!

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:56.110
He can still change, Jimmy.

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:57.411
Remember the thief on the cross?

01:21:57.413 --> 01:22:00.481
He probably killed
Dad, and he probably,

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.182
God knows what he
did to Mom, Eli!

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:03.350
He shot Faith!

01:22:06.155 --> 01:22:07.922
Faith?

01:22:12.662 --> 01:22:13.662
Faith.

01:22:18.501 --> 01:22:20.134
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:22.970
It was an accident.

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.571
It wasn't your fault.

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:29.577
I don't blame you.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.113
Whose food are you
gonna give him, huh?

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.682
Who's gonna watch
him when has to go?

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:37.618
No, you stay away from him!

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:38.620
Jimmy!

01:22:43.492 --> 01:22:45.125
We've got to take care of him.

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:46.560
No, we don't, Faith!

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:48.462
Why do you think
murdering an unarmed man

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.698
is the only option, Jimmy?

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.134
If man's blood is shed by man,

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:56.370
then his blood will
be shed by man, too.

01:23:00.509 --> 01:23:02.609
I thought I was gonna
die when I got shot

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:04.011
on the day Daddy died.

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:08.049
I'm so sorry.

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:17.558
We can't just kill him.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.326
Well, what do you suppose we do?

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.661
My name's Faith.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:21.996
I don't know.

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.032
I know who you are.

01:23:25.034 --> 01:23:26.034
Really?

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:37.011
I lost my Faith on
the day you were born.

01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:39.580
I've been a bad man, baby.

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:44.685
Why don't you quit being bad?

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:45.652
I can't.

01:23:45.654 --> 01:23:47.221
Ask God to help.

01:23:49.792 --> 01:23:53.427
I don't know Him anymore.

01:23:53.429 --> 01:23:54.661
I'll ask Him for you.

01:23:56.098 --> 01:23:57.164
Don't go near him Faith!

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.198
Jimmy, wait!

01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.567
This is stupid.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:03.804
Dear Jesus, please.

01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:16.283
No!

01:24:16.285 --> 01:24:17.351
Wait, wait!

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:21.822
Faith.

01:24:21.824 --> 01:24:24.825
I got to tell you
something about your dad.

01:24:26.796 --> 01:24:29.063
Go, go, go!

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:33.634
Wait, I know that guy.

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:34.535
There's a knife under the seat.

01:24:34.537 --> 01:24:35.803
Protect Jimmy!

01:24:35.805 --> 01:24:36.805
What?

01:24:43.479 --> 01:24:44.778
Gun, gun, Jack!

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.480
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot.

01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:47.482
Don't shoot.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.693
Not gonna need that anymore.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:00.695
Come on.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:03.730
Dad shot somebody?

01:25:12.675 --> 01:25:14.741
They were gonna kill me!

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:19.279
Come on, Liz, pick
up for me, pick up!

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:20.714
Ah!

01:25:21.717 --> 01:25:23.851
Here, put pressure on it.

01:25:23.853 --> 01:25:24.885
What?

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:26.220
Your cut, it's bleeding.

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:30.457
Check on Jimmy, see if
he's bleeding from his ear.

01:25:32.361 --> 01:25:35.262
No, doesn't look like it.

01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:36.497
Wait a minute.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.233
I know you.

01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:41.869
Yeah, we've met before.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:45.806
You're that doctor.

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.411
Is this your kid?

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:52.613
That's one of 'em.

01:25:55.451 --> 01:25:56.683
You know, I only had one.

01:25:58.287 --> 01:25:59.453
Never got the chance to tell you

01:25:59.455 --> 01:26:01.455
how sorry I am
about your daughter.

01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:03.223
Sorry don't bring my Faith back

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:05.626
or the years I spent in prison.

01:26:07.363 --> 01:26:09.530
Is there some place you
want me to drop you off?

01:26:12.401 --> 01:26:13.500
Oh, my head.

01:26:15.905 --> 01:26:17.404
You'll be all right, Jimmy.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:18.772
You're gonna be fine.

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.507
You can drop me right here.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.290
Hey, I need a ride.

01:26:37.393 --> 01:26:38.492
I'm by the tracks.

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:40.894
Change of plans.

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.598
Bring the gear.

01:26:45.935 --> 01:26:47.467
We're gonna make a house call.

01:26:54.276 --> 01:26:56.610
All right, Doc.

01:27:00.482 --> 01:27:01.748
Time for you to feel my pain.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.726
Daddy!

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.867
Faith, go to the creek.

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:24.472
Now.

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:39.786
It's my fault.

01:27:42.024 --> 01:27:43.657
It's my fault.

01:27:46.562 --> 01:27:47.928
It's all my fault.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:59.439
Hey, it's my fault.

01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:02.809
It's my fault.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:05.512
I'm sorry.

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:06.514
I love you so much.

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:11.618
Hey, you're my boy.

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:16.523
My boy.

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:17.525
Come on.

01:28:29.571 --> 01:28:30.571
We'll catch up.

01:28:31.907 --> 01:28:32.907
All right.

01:28:40.082 --> 01:28:44.885
I don't know why we're wasting
our time going to the park.

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:47.921
We'll never be happy again.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:56.530
You know, we're all sad,
but we will see her again.

01:28:59.368 --> 01:29:01.501
How can I go play
with Jimmy pretending

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:02.636
that it never happened?

01:29:03.806 --> 01:29:04.838
Um, okay.

01:29:08.077 --> 01:29:12.012
When Becca died, it just was

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:13.914
as if all I could
feel was anger.

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:18.919
Baby, God is good.

01:29:20.956 --> 01:29:24.825
He's what is good in this
broken world, and He is loving,

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:26.660
even when we're not
sure about it now.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:32.032
But if we trust Him, everything,
everything will be fine.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.036
More than fine,
it'll be beautiful.

01:29:38.107 --> 01:29:40.974
Oh, Mommy, I just don't see it.

01:29:40.976 --> 01:29:42.976
I know, baby, and that's why

01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:45.512
we walk by faith, not by sight.

01:29:46.782 --> 01:29:48.382
Just imagine all the good things

01:29:48.384 --> 01:29:50.851
that God has given to us, hmm?

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:55.021
I love you.

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:56.556
I love you.

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:58.125
All the darkness
of this world is

01:29:58.127 --> 01:30:00.761
just a tiny little
speck in the light.

01:30:01.964 --> 01:30:04.664
We're not gonna lose faith

01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:07.534
and make a decision
based on fear,

01:30:07.536 --> 01:30:11.538
a fear of a godless future
that doesn't even exist.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.175
Vengeance belongs
to God, not us.

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:21.681
Soph, Sophie.

01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:24.085
Sophie.

01:30:26.155 --> 01:30:27.988
Shh.

01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.624
- Sophie.
- Shh, don't talk.

01:30:36.198 --> 01:30:41.001
Adam, you are a good man.

01:30:47.643 --> 01:30:48.643
And I forgive you.

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:57.651
There's no greater love

01:30:59.988 --> 01:31:01.721
than the one you've given me.

01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:08.128
Will you

01:31:11.567 --> 01:31:12.999
marry me?

01:31:16.939 --> 01:31:17.939
Yes.

01:31:36.792 --> 01:31:41.728
With this ring,

01:31:42.631 --> 01:31:44.998
I thee wed.

01:32:39.621 --> 01:32:40.621
Why?

01:33:02.244 --> 01:33:04.311
You should've let me kill him!

01:33:04.313 --> 01:33:06.580
'Cause now he's out there
and he's comin' back.

01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:07.681
You can be sure of that.

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:27.968
Jimmy, please
think this through.

01:33:29.738 --> 01:33:31.271
Come with me, buddy.

01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:34.274
Jimmy, don't go, please.

01:33:38.814 --> 01:33:40.614
We're a family!

01:33:40.616 --> 01:33:45.318
Jimmy, Jimmy, please!

01:33:55.230 --> 01:34:00.133
Fire, the tepee's on fire!

01:34:02.204 --> 01:34:03.844
Faith, go try and save
the bugout bag, go!

01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:08.041
Grab those buckets!

01:34:08.043 --> 01:34:12.112
Sophie!

01:34:12.114 --> 01:34:13.780
Go fill it
up with water, come on!

01:34:19.755 --> 01:34:21.121
Guys, guys, just stop.

01:34:22.391 --> 01:34:23.391
It's hopeless.

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:25.660
It's over.

01:34:27.796 --> 01:34:29.963
What do we do now?

01:34:29.965 --> 01:34:31.297
There's nothing left.

01:35:04.066 --> 01:35:05.398
Our bow and arrows are gone.

01:35:16.078 --> 01:35:20.880
I want to go to Heaven
to be with Daddy and Mommy.

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:21.882
Okay.

01:35:24.019 --> 01:35:25.785
It's just a little
while longer, okay?

01:35:28.123 --> 01:35:30.857
Just a little while longer.

01:35:30.859 --> 01:35:32.358
Sophie, Eli!

01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:37.163
Faith?

01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:38.264
- Mommy?
- Faith!

01:35:38.266 --> 01:35:39.866
Mommy!

01:35:39.868 --> 01:35:44.437
Mom, we missed you.

01:35:45.841 --> 01:35:48.875
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:35:48.877 --> 01:35:50.343
I saw the smoke.

01:35:50.345 --> 01:35:51.745
It's gonna be fine,
it's gonna be fine.

01:35:51.747 --> 01:35:55.014
I missed you so much.

01:35:55.016 --> 01:35:56.282
Oh, Soph, I missed you.

01:35:56.284 --> 01:35:57.484
Mom.

01:36:03.792 --> 01:36:05.358
I need a moment alone with her.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.227
Yes, ma'am, take your time.

01:36:08.997 --> 01:36:11.131
I wish you'd been here.

01:36:11.133 --> 01:36:13.500
Man, your mom
missed you guys so much.

01:36:13.502 --> 01:36:14.901
I couldn't save him.

01:36:14.903 --> 01:36:17.003
She talked about you guys.

01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:19.773
I missed her a lot, too.

01:36:21.409 --> 01:36:23.076
Anybody hurt?

01:36:23.078 --> 01:36:24.310
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:36:30.152 --> 01:36:31.217
How'd you do it, Mom?

01:36:34.523 --> 01:36:35.555
How do you let go?

01:36:46.034 --> 01:36:47.834
I'm not sure I have.

01:37:06.354 --> 01:37:07.520
Who did this?

01:37:10.926 --> 01:37:11.991
Doesn't even matter.

01:37:20.902 --> 01:37:22.602
We're gonna get
through this together.

01:37:27.976 --> 01:37:28.976
Come on.

01:37:32.614 --> 01:37:34.948
Mom, what now?

01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:36.182
These men are deputies.

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:38.084
They're gonna take
us some place safe.

01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:38.952
Really?

01:37:38.954 --> 01:37:39.986
We're the good guys.

01:37:39.988 --> 01:37:41.454
I'm Jase.

01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:44.357
And I'm his big brother
Dave, and his hero,

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.092
his role model,
his father figure.

01:37:46.094 --> 01:37:47.327
I don't mean to brag.

01:37:47.329 --> 01:37:49.262
Don't forget to tell
'em about your humility.

01:37:49.264 --> 01:37:51.497
Listen, I'm the better brother

01:37:51.499 --> 01:37:54.367
because I have some
chocolate in my bag.

01:37:56.104 --> 01:37:57.637
They're not gonna eat
that out of your grubby bag.

01:37:57.639 --> 01:38:00.006
Yes, they will, and I
know what you're thinking.

01:38:01.276 --> 01:38:03.643
Why would anybody walk
through these woods

01:38:03.645 --> 01:38:05.211
with Christmas tree lights

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:06.880
draped across their
chest like that?

01:38:06.882 --> 01:38:07.881
It's ridiculous.

01:38:07.883 --> 01:38:09.466
Because I look so good in 'em.

01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:11.050
No, you don't look good.
You look like an idiot.

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:12.652
You're screamin' for
someone to shoot us.

01:38:12.654 --> 01:38:14.954
Anything's
better than walkin' around

01:38:14.956 --> 01:38:17.156
with a rifle that
weighs, like, 50 pounds.

01:38:17.158 --> 01:38:18.158
Where's Jimmy?

01:38:33.108 --> 01:38:36.910
Ah!

01:38:36.912 --> 01:38:37.977
Sophie, help!

01:38:43.285 --> 01:38:44.285
Help!

01:38:46.054 --> 01:38:48.655
Sophie!

01:38:50.292 --> 01:38:51.292
AnnaLee!

01:39:08.476 --> 01:39:09.476
Help, help!

01:39:13.114 --> 01:39:14.114
Help!

01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:16.417
Jimmy!

01:39:18.053 --> 01:39:21.521
Robby, Robby, I was on my
way to join you guys.

01:39:21.523 --> 01:39:25.291
Well, somebody call 911.

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:28.328
I had my eye on this bad boy.

01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:33.166
Oh!

01:39:33.168 --> 01:39:36.402
Ah, oh yeah, that's nice.

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:42.275
No, Clint, don't kill him!

01:39:43.378 --> 01:39:44.378
What?

01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.180
You heard me.

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:50.717
Don't kill him, okay?

01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:53.553
Jimmy and I, we go,
we go way back.

01:39:53.555 --> 01:39:56.055
- Oh.
- It's true.

01:39:56.057 --> 01:39:57.623
Okay. Yeah.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.726
Robby!

01:39:59.728 --> 01:40:02.428
Jase, you and Liz, Sophie.

01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:03.563
Just wait here for me.

01:40:05.533 --> 01:40:06.632
Kneel down right here.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.406
What'd you do that for?

01:40:13.408 --> 01:40:14.407
'Cause it's my turn!

01:40:14.409 --> 01:40:15.409
Robby!

01:40:17.445 --> 01:40:19.178
- No!
- Yeah, thank ya.

01:40:24.285 --> 01:40:27.186
You guys just do what I
say, and you'll be fine.

01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:46.572
Jimmy, what's
gonna happen to me?

01:40:47.776 --> 01:40:48.776
I don't know.

01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:51.511
Robby?

01:40:51.513 --> 01:40:52.678
Jimmy, it hurts.

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:54.747
Robby, stay with me, Robby!

01:41:03.091 --> 01:41:06.225
Your sisters, now
they got food and guns.

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:09.495
Please, please
just leave 'em alone.

01:41:09.497 --> 01:41:12.331
Stop acting like
you care about 'em.

01:41:12.333 --> 01:41:15.368
You already told Robby you
were gonna leave 'em, right?

01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:17.470
You wanted to join the gang.

01:41:18.773 --> 01:41:21.307
Now what did you think that'd do

01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:22.775
for their chances
of survival, huh?

01:41:26.481 --> 01:41:28.514
God, God.

01:41:30.618 --> 01:41:32.785
I'm sorry.

01:41:34.489 --> 01:41:37.290
Oh, he's finding religion
with his neck in a noose.

01:41:38.626 --> 01:41:41.861
So meaningful.

01:41:44.332 --> 01:41:45.565
They're about to shoot him.

01:41:45.567 --> 01:41:47.233
Take aim.

01:41:47.235 --> 01:41:48.868
We've got to do this together.

01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:50.636
There's too many of 'em.

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:52.338
I can't do it.

01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:55.208
You will do it
or Jimmy will die.

01:41:55.210 --> 01:41:56.242
Pick it up.

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.214
You take the guy with
the machete, on three.

01:42:02.317 --> 01:42:04.150
One, two.

01:42:10.492 --> 01:42:11.657
Ah, missed one.

01:42:17.398 --> 01:42:18.398
Jimmy's aiming at Mom.

01:42:21.402 --> 01:42:23.336
Watch for friendly fire
over there, Christmas Tree.

01:42:23.338 --> 01:42:25.771
How in the world
was he born first?

01:42:26.708 --> 01:42:27.708
Help!

01:42:29.477 --> 01:42:33.746
Hey, shot your daddy,
shot your sister.

01:42:34.816 --> 01:42:35.816
Now you.

01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:44.390
But first your Mama.

01:43:12.787 --> 01:43:15.521
Jimmy, baby, it's gonna be okay.

01:43:15.523 --> 01:43:16.522
Mom.

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:18.457
Okay, get ready to pull him.

01:43:18.459 --> 01:43:19.592
We need to I'm so sorry.

01:43:19.594 --> 01:43:21.460
Pull back! I'm sorry.

01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:22.628
- I shouldn't have went inside.
- It's okay.

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:23.629
Pull him back, pull him back!

01:43:23.631 --> 01:43:24.664
Pull him back!

01:43:28.903 --> 01:43:29.969
Gimme that canteen.

01:43:29.971 --> 01:43:31.470
Sophie.

01:43:35.677 --> 01:43:37.310
You're okay, you're okay.

01:43:37.312 --> 01:43:39.545
You were right, Sophie.

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:41.480
I should've watched
my step after all.

01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:43.583
Here, baby, drink this.

01:43:43.585 --> 01:43:44.750
You've lost a lot of blood.

01:43:45.787 --> 01:43:46.787
Mom!

01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:50.356
It's over!

01:43:50.358 --> 01:43:51.757
Sophie, Sophie, no, no, no!

01:43:51.759 --> 01:43:52.858
He defended me!

01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:53.759
He defended me, Soph!

01:43:53.761 --> 01:43:55.394
You know this guy?

01:43:55.396 --> 01:43:57.463
If it's over, then drop the bow.

01:43:57.465 --> 01:43:59.145
- Drop the bow.
- He saved my life.

01:44:00.001 --> 01:44:01.267
And the arrows.

01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:03.769
You did this to us.

01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:05.371
- Mom!
- Take it easy, Liz.

01:44:05.373 --> 01:44:06.806
He's unarmed.

01:44:06.808 --> 01:44:10.243
The gear, the ammo,
it's all there.

01:44:13.915 --> 01:44:16.682
Jimmy, the lock of hair,

01:44:17.952 --> 01:44:21.754
Becca's lock of hair,
it's there, too.

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:22.955
I'm so sorry.

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:24.857
It wasn't mine to take.

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:28.494
Mom, stop.

01:44:28.496 --> 01:44:29.996
You did this to us.

01:44:31.633 --> 01:44:33.332
You killed my husband!

01:44:33.334 --> 01:44:34.834
Think about what
you're doin', Liz.

01:44:34.836 --> 01:44:36.569
I'm sorry. Mom, please.

01:44:36.571 --> 01:44:37.403
I deserve your hate.

01:44:37.405 --> 01:44:38.405
Please.

01:44:39.974 --> 01:44:42.908
He killed your father and Adam.

01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:44.644
Stay back, Faith!

01:44:44.646 --> 01:44:46.746
And now he's come for Faith?

01:44:48.716 --> 01:44:50.449
I never wanted
to take your Faith.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:53.986
I just needed to find mine.

01:44:56.991 --> 01:44:58.858
I just needed to find mine.

01:45:01.296 --> 01:45:02.828
Mom, we will see them again.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.335
Mercy is the light, the light

01:45:09.337 --> 01:45:11.604
that swallows up
all the darkness.

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:20.346
I forgive you, Jack.

01:45:22.016 --> 01:45:23.016
What?

01:45:27.588 --> 01:45:32.525
Faith, Faith.

01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:41.500
Sophie, you can forgive him
for the crime against you.

01:45:42.804 --> 01:45:45.004
But for murder,
he's gonna stand trial.

01:46:01.422 --> 01:46:03.622
Now don't try to run off.

01:46:03.624 --> 01:46:06.859
Jase and I can take ya, but
once your fists start flying,

01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:09.362
I'm afraid he may curl
up into a fetal position,

01:46:09.364 --> 01:46:11.997
start sucking his thumb like
he did when we were kids.

01:46:16.771 --> 01:46:17.903
I ain't going anywhere.

01:46:25.713 --> 01:46:28.714
I've been fighting with Him

01:46:28.716 --> 01:46:33.386
ever since my Faith died,
destroying everything in my way.

01:46:37.792 --> 01:46:38.792
I'm done running.

01:46:46.801 --> 01:46:49.869
I owe those kids
and their mother

01:46:52.039 --> 01:46:53.639
more than I can ever repay.

01:46:58.112 --> 01:46:59.879
How could they
forgive me like that?

01:47:03.918 --> 01:47:05.885
I'm so ashamed.

01:47:05.887 --> 01:47:07.247
Man, you can never repay it,

01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:10.523
but there's one who's
already paid it for you.

01:47:11.492 --> 01:47:12.492
It's Jesus.

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:18.664
I was so close to killing him.

01:47:20.501 --> 01:47:22.468
If you had, you'd
be dead right now.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.006
God can save anybody.

01:47:29.177 --> 01:47:31.110
He might turn out to
be the best of us.

01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:37.116
I'm askin'.

01:47:37.118 --> 01:47:38.118
I'm askin'.

01:47:40.087 --> 01:47:44.957
Lord, forgive me for all
the pain I've caused,

01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:48.794
for all I've done wrong.

01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:06.178
Hey!

01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:09.149
It's my turn.

01:49:45.146 --> 01:49:48.247
I'll see you again, my love.

01:49:52.019 --> 01:49:53.886
Jack may have got
baptized, but he needs

01:49:53.888 --> 01:49:55.254
some deodorant right about now.

01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:56.956
Ooh!

01:49:56.958 --> 01:49:57.958
- Jack.
- Jack.

01:49:59.026 --> 01:50:00.125
I thought that was you.

01:50:00.127 --> 01:50:02.027
No, man.

01:50:02.029 --> 01:50:03.596
Your hands gettin'
warm over there?

01:50:03.598 --> 01:50:04.863
You guys are hoggin' the fire.

01:50:04.865 --> 01:50:06.632
- Well.
- Feel good?

01:50:06.634 --> 01:50:08.067
- Yeah.
- I'm not sharing.

01:50:08.069 --> 01:50:09.935
- Oh.
- What's it like out there?

01:50:11.939 --> 01:50:13.606
It's chaos, it's anarchy.

01:50:14.976 --> 01:50:18.377
But here's the good
part, is that our city

01:50:18.379 --> 01:50:20.813
is one of the few
islands of light

01:50:20.815 --> 01:50:22.815
in a nation full of darkness.

01:50:24.285 --> 01:50:26.652
And now our city is actually
one of the only places

01:50:26.654 --> 01:50:30.055
successfully resisting
tyranny and disarmament.

01:50:31.325 --> 01:50:33.158
Is there hope?

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.860
For our nation, I mean.

01:50:34.862 --> 01:50:37.696
If God can fix me and
Jack, He can do anything.
