00:17.120 --> 00:18.496
I DON'T EVEN WANT SARAH AROUND.

00:18.530 --> 00:19.633
DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?

00:20.570 --> 00:21.525
- SURGERY WENT WELL.

00:21.570 --> 00:22.662
THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.497
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE
HOW HE RESPONDS.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.380
- NO, SHE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SARAH.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.103
HER DAUGHTER'S PREGNANT SO SHE'S
GONNA HAVE BREAKFAST WITH US.

02:01.250 --> 02:05.562
- I'LL JUST PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.419
- "ROME ALONE.

02:06.470 --> 02:10.224

ON MY RIBS.

02:18.270 --> 02:20.500
- WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU HURT?

02:20.550 --> 02:22.438
- I MEAN, MY RIBS
ARE JUST BRUISED.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.617
IT'S NOT--IT'S ALREADY HEALED.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.719
- WHY ARE THEY JUST--WAIT,
WHY ARE THEY JUST BRUISED?

02:25.760 --> 02:27.512

02:27.560 --> 02:29.619

MOTORCYCLE SPILL.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.599
- WHOA.

02:32.630 --> 02:33.904
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A LITTLE MOTORCYCLE SPILL?

02:33.940 --> 02:35.453
THAT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE A LITTLE MOTORCYCLE SPILL.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.525
- IT WAS A LITTLE--
- HAVE YOU SEEN A DOCTOR YET?

02:37.570 --> 02:38.764
- WHAT AM I GONNA SEE
A DOCTOR ABOUT?

02:38.810 --> 02:40.391
THEY'RE JUST BRUISED.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

02:40.430 --> 02:41.943
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT A DOCTOR.
- WELL, IF THEY WERE BROKEN,

02:41.980 --> 02:44.289
THERE WOULD BE, LIKE, SHARDS
AND STUFF STABBED IN MY LUNGS.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.469
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW--WHY
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS EARLIER?

02:46.510 --> 02:47.772
YOU NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR
FOR THAT.

02:47.820 --> 02:48.889
- I'M SORRY I YELLED.
IT'S FINE.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.501
I'M TOUGH.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

02:50.540 --> 02:52.679
- NO, IT'S MORE LIKE,
"WE DON'T RIDE MOTORCYCLES.:

02:52.720 --> 02:53.744
- SORRY I YELLED.
- THAT'S THE LESSON HERE.

02:53.790 --> 02:55.473
- DON'T RIDE MOTORCYCLES.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.511
- RIGHT.
BUT YOU'RE STILL TOUGH.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.199
- OKAY, I BET YOU HE WASN'T
TOUGH WHEN HE HIT THE GROUND.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.616
YOU DIDN'T SOUND TOUGH
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.378
- I DIDN'T CRY, SO--
- YEAH, RIGHT.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.479

03:04.520 --> 03:07.409
SHE WOULDN'T CRY.
YOU WANT TO SEE A TRAITOR?

03:36.940 --> 03:38.441
I GOT KICKED

06:02.460 --> 06:03.427
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.041
- YOU READ PITCHFORK.
- WE'RE SCREWED.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.945
- I THOUGHT YOU GOT ALL
YOUR MUSIC NEWS FROM STARBUCKS.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.390
- CROSBY, THIS ISN'T
A JOKE, OKAY?

06:08.430 --> 06:09.738
- YEAH, OBVIOUSLY IT'S--

06:09.780 --> 06:10.599
- AND NONE OF THIS WOULD BE
HAPPENING, BY THE WAY,

06:10.640 --> 06:11.846
IF YOU WERE ABLE
TO KEEP HIM ON TOUR

06:11.880 --> 06:12.915
LIKE YOU SAID YOU'D BE
ABLE TO.

06:12.950 --> 06:14.190
- WELL, AGAIN--I--OKAY, I--

06:14.230 --> 06:15.015

06:15.060 --> 06:16.846
- YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
OKAY?

06:16.890 --> 06:19.404
WELL, HOW MUCH CAN HE DO?
WE HAVE A CONTRACT.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.192
- YEAH, WE HAVE A CONTRACT
WITH ASHES OF ROME.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.926
WE DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH
OLIVER ROME, THE SOLO ARTIST.

06:24.970 --> 06:26.096
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

06:26.140 --> 06:27.789
- NO. WE HAVE CONTRACT
WITH THE BAND.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.411
- OLIVER ROME IS ASHES OF ROME.

06:29.450 --> 06:30.963
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T SIGN ANYTHING
WITH HIM?

06:31.010 --> 06:32.898
- IT'S A BAND.
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT

06:32.940 --> 06:35.454
HE'D TRY AND GO SIGN UP AS
A SOLO ARTIST WITH SUB MODO?

06:35.490 --> 06:38.141
- LISTEN TO ME, YOU SCREWED
THE POOCH ON THIS BIG TIME.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.282
- I SCREWED THE--

06:39.320 --> 06:41.140
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
BE ABLE TO KEEP HIM ON TOUR.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.396
- THAT'S LIKE NOT HAVING
MICHAEL JACKSON

06:42.430 --> 06:45.081
IN THE, WELL, JACKSON FIVE.
- WELL, I TRIED CALLING HIM.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.530
I CAN'T REACH HIM, SO
YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

06:46.570 --> 06:50.643
THIS IS ON YOU.
IT'S NOT ON ME.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.571
- I THINK THE CONTRACT
IS THE HEADLINE OF THIS.

06:54.620 --> 06:57.134
- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS
LETTING US COME BY.

06:57.170 --> 06:59.616

APPRECIATE YOU GUYS COMING BY.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.992

07:27.410 --> 07:30.026
SO THAT I CAN GET ANOTHER BOGUS
APOLOGY FOR MY DAUGHTER?

07:30.070 --> 07:32.265
NO. WHAT I WANT
IS YOUR ASSURANCE

07:32.310 --> 07:33.538
THAT THIS IS NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

07:33.590 --> 07:35.967
- HONEY.

IS OUT OF CONTROL.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.599
- OKAY.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.006
I UNDERSTAND YOU GUYS ARE UPSET.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.075
SHE'S CLEARLY GOING
THROUGH A TOUGH TIME RIGHT NOW.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.213
- I DON'T NEED TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER'S TOUGH TIME.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.284
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

07:52.330 --> 07:53.558
- I'M SO SORRY.
- WELL, MAYBE YOU

07:53.610 --> 07:56.181
NEED TO STOP BEING SORRY AND,
LIKE, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

07:56.230 --> 07:57.151
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.668
- ALL RIGHT.
- I AM SO SORRY.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.472
TRULY, I'M VERY SORRY.

08:02.820 --> 08:08.133
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER.

08:08.170 --> 08:09.478

08:17.080 --> 08:19.139
FOR WHEN I'M UPSTAIRS OR AROUND
THE BACK OR SOMETHING,

08:19.180 --> 08:21.182
SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO YELL,

08:21.220 --> 08:22.801
[bell jingles]

08:22.840 --> 08:26.150
GOOD IDEA?

08:26.190 --> 08:29.182

08:29.230 --> 08:31.676
HAVE YOU DONE THIS?

08:31.710 --> 08:35.123
HAVE YOU EVEN
MOVED FROM THAT SPOT?

08:35.160 --> 08:36.297
COME ON.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.671
I WAS GONNA GET SOME FRESH AIR.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.267
- I'M WATCHING
THE JOHN WAYNE MARATHON.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.029
IT JUST STARTED.
DON'T MAKE ME YELL.

08:42.070 --> 08:43.549
- YEAH, WELL,
IT'S A GOOD THING WE HAVE TIVO.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.750
COME ON. LET'S GO.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.176
STRETCH YOUR LEGS.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.245
- WHAT HAPPENED TO,

08:47.280 --> 08:49.032
"YOU GO
AT YOUR OWN PACE, ZEEK.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.274
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME?"

08:50.320 --> 08:51.412
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?
- BECAUSE THE DOCTOR

08:51.460 --> 08:54.861
SAID WE HAVE TO BUILD UP
TO A WALK AROUND THE BLOCK.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.184
- WE--THE DOCTOR THE SAYS--
THE "WE" HAS GOT TO STOP.

08:56.220 --> 08:57.209
IT'S NOT "WE".

08:57.260 --> 08:59.148
IT'S ME, ALL RIGHT?

08:59.190 --> 09:01.875
IT'S MY THING, AND HE SAID
TAKE IT AT YOUR OWN PACE,

09:01.920 --> 09:03.364
AND RIGHT NOW MY PACE

09:03.400 --> 09:06.085
IS I'M GONNA WATCH
JOHN WAYNE BLOW SOMETHING UP.

09:06.130 --> 09:10.169
- OKAY, THEN WHY DON'T WE JUST
WALK HERE SOMEWHERE?

09:10.200 --> 09:12.361
LET'S WALK AROUND THE COUCH.
- WHAT?

09:12.410 --> 09:13.957
- WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE WALK
AROUND THE COUCH.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.308
- WHY THE HELL--I MEAN, WHY--

09:16.170 --> 09:18.206
WALK AROUND THE COUCH?

09:18.240 --> 09:20.174
- WELL, BECAUSE YOU GOT TO--

09:20.210 --> 09:21.825
YOU GOT TO START MOVING.

09:21.870 --> 09:24.247
- IF YOU WANT
TO RUN AROUND HERE,

09:24.280 --> 09:25.838
YOU JUST KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

09:25.870 --> 09:27.007
YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD,

09:27.040 --> 09:30.112
BUT JUST DUCK
WHEN YOU GO BY THE TV.

09:34.190 --> 09:36.943
- HOW HOT DOES IT GET
AROUND HERE?

09:36.990 --> 09:39.185
- OH, 90.

09:39.230 --> 09:42.336
- KIARA, JUSTIN, EDGAR,
AARON, YOU GUYS ROCKED IT TODAY.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.292
- IS THIS PORK OR TURKEY?
- THAT IS PORK.

09:44.340 --> 09:46.160
AND, EDGAR, YOU CHOPPED
THOSE ONIONS SO FINE,

09:46.200 --> 09:47.303
WE ARE GONNA
CALL YOU THE CHOPPER, ALL RIGHT?

09:47.340 --> 09:48.750
- MR. BRAVERMAN--
- I WANT A NICKNAME.

09:48.790 --> 09:49.950
- OH, JUST A SECOND KIARA.
YOU WANT A NICKNAME?

09:50.000 --> 09:50.648
- YEAH.
- MR. BRAVERMAN--

09:50.690 --> 09:51.611
- YOU'RE THE PRINCE OF PEAS.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.161
- ONE SECOND, KIARA.
- THIS IS SUCCOTASH.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.132
- IT IS SUCCOTASH.
YOU'RE SUCCOTASH NASH.

09:55.180 --> 09:56.204
- I WANT ONE.
- MR. BRAVERMAN--

09:56.250 --> 09:58.172
- WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO BE?

09:58.210 --> 09:59.142
- GINGERBREAD MAN.
- YOU'RE THE GINGERBREAD MAN.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.966
- MR. BRAVERMAN--
- HOW ABOUT YOU, KIARA?

10:01.010 --> 10:01.863
- I DON'T WANT A NICKNAME.
- YOU DON'T WANT A NICKNAME?

10:01.910 --> 10:02.979
HOW COME?
- THEY PROMOTE FAVORITISM.

10:03.010 --> 10:05.149
- OKAY, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO HAVE A NICKNAME.

10:05.190 --> 10:06.009
GUYS, GRAB YOURSELF SOME LUNCH.

10:06.050 --> 10:08.086
YOU GUYS WERE JUST ON POINT
TODAY.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.257
AWESOME.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.393
HEY.

10:10.430 --> 10:11.670
- HEY.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.189
- MY KITCHEN IS HUMMING.
- I KNOW.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.016
IT LOOKS GOOD IN THERE.
- THESE GUYS ARE LOCKED IN.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.152
- LOCKED IN.
- YOU KNOW THAT?

10:16.200 --> 10:17.815
- YEAH.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:18.990 --> 10:20.298
- JUST CHECKING OUT
THE NEW GIRL.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.649
YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE
SHE'S ADJUSTING OKAY.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.442
- MAX IS LETTING HER SIT BY HIM.
- YEAH, I KNOW, IT'S GREAT.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.129
- MAN, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
HE HASN'T EATEN ALONE HERE.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.137
- I KNOW.
IT'S ONLY BEEN--

10:27.170 --> 10:28.273
- SO YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
A HIGH FIVE ON THIS?

10:28.310 --> 10:29.413
- IT'S A GREAT THING.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.247
JUST, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT HER.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.316
SHE'S VERY ABRUPT,

10:33.350 --> 10:35.238
SHE'S VERY BLUNT--
- WELL, SO IS MAX.

10:35.280 --> 10:36.417
- AN ATTITUDE--
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:36.460 --> 10:38.178
- I JUST--MAYBE I
SHOULD WALK OVER THERE.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.494
- I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
- JUST--WHAT?

10:39.530 --> 10:40.906
- KRISTINA, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- TELL US WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

10:40.950 --> 10:42.110
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- WHY?

10:42.150 --> 10:43.253
- BECAUSE YOU'RE HEADMASTER
BRAVERMAN RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

10:43.290 --> 10:44.279
- YEAH.
- YOU'VE GOT SWITCH OFF

10:44.330 --> 10:45.911
MOM E40DE.

10:45.950 --> 10:47.326
- YOU'VE GOT TO TREAT MAX
LIKE ANY OTHER KID HERE.

10:47.370 --> 10:48.189
OKAY?
- OKAY.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.390
- HE'S FINE.
- OKAY.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.953
- HE'S OKAY.
- I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

10:50.990 --> 10:52.810
- ALL RIGHT. YEAH.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.192
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO YOUR KITCHEN?

10:54.230 --> 10:55.436
- OH, SO YOU CAN WALK OVER THERE
AND CHECK UP ON THEM?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.788
- I WASN'T GONNA DO THAT.
- YOU WEREN'T?

10:56.820 --> 10:57.787
- I WASN'T.
- YOU SURE?

10:57.820 --> 10:59.060
- YOU HAVE TRUST ISSUES.
- DO I?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.306
- YOU DO.
- OKAY, LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

11:00.340 --> 11:02.137
ARE YOU GONNA WALK OVER THERE?

11:02.170 --> 11:03.205
ARE YOU?

11:03.240 --> 11:04.446
- NO.

11:04.490 --> 11:05.752
- NO?

11:07.390 --> 11:08.721
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

11:08.770 --> 11:10.658
- YES, IT DOES.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.780
- HI, SARAH.
- HI.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.493
- UH, IS HANK HERE?

11:20.540 --> 11:23.293
- OH, HI SANDY.
UM, HANK IS NOT.

11:23.330 --> 11:27.334
HE'S AT A JOB.

11:27.370 --> 11:30.191
HE SHOULD BE HERE PRETI'Y SOON
IF YOU WANT TO WAIT, OR--

11:30.240 --> 11:32.094
- THANKS, THAT'S OKAY.

11:32.130 --> 11:35.167
COULD YOU PLEASE JUST TELL HIM
THAT I STOPPED BY?

11:35.210 --> 11:36.234
- OF COURSE.
- THANK YOU.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.100
- SURE.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.199
HEY, SAN DY.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.378
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS COULD USE
ANY HELP, YOU AND RUBY,

11:43.420 --> 11:45.832
I KNOW THE AREA REALLY WELL

11:45.870 --> 11:48.839
AND I MOVED HERE MYSELF
WITH TWO TEENAGERS,

11:48.880 --> 11:52.464
AND IT'S A BIG TRANSITION,
AND SO--

11:52.500 --> 11:55.799
- LISTEN, I KNOW
THAT YOU WORK FOR HANK AND YOU--

11:55.850 --> 11:57.294
- WE WORK TOGETHER,
BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.015
- OKAY, I THINK YOU TWO
ARE APPARENTLY DATING.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.368
WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN YOU GUYS--

12:01.410 --> 12:03.059
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS,

12:03.100 --> 12:07.309
AND THIS IS NOTHING PERSONAL
AGAINST YOU,

12:07.340 --> 12:09.092
BUT I MOVED BACK HERE

12:09.140 --> 12:11.233
SO THAT RUBY COULD SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HER DAD.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.169
AND I--I JUST DON'T FEEL
THAT THAT TIME

12:14.210 --> 12:17.384
NEEDS TO INCLUDE YOU.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.832
AND I FEEL LIKE I WAS

12:19.870 --> 12:23.567
PRETI'Y CLEAR ABOUT THAT
WITH HANK.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.182
- OH, YOU'VE ALREADY HAD
THAT DISCUSSION WITH HIM?

12:26.220 --> 12:27.972
- YEAH.
- RIGHT. OKAY.

12:28.020 --> 12:30.329
UM, OKAY, WELL--

12:30.370 --> 12:32.395
- UM, COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST BE SURE

12:32.440 --> 12:34.840
THAT YOU TELL HIM
THAT I STOPPED BY?

12:34.890 --> 12:36.266
- MM-HMM.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.882
- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.329
- BYE.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.032
- OUR JOURNEY
OF SELF-DISCOVERY--

12:50.070 --> 12:52.140
NAMASTE.
- OH MY GOD.

12:52.180 --> 12:55.240
I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU
WHAT AN IDIOT OLIVER ROME IS.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.975
HE'S ON TOUR MAKING A TON
OF MONEY, HAVING A BLAST--

12:58.010 --> 12:59.284
THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR HIM,
SO NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

12:59.330 --> 13:02.015
HE'S AT A SPIRITUAL HEALING
CENTER IN BIG SUR?

13:02.050 --> 13:04.223
AND HE'S IN NEGOTIATIONS
WITH SUB MODO?

13:04.260 --> 13:06.012
I MEAN, IF HE SIGHS WITH THEM,
LUNCHEONE'ITE'S DONE.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.459
THAT'S IT.

13:07.510 --> 13:10.434
SO I HAVE TO GO TO BIG SUR NOW,
'CAUSE ADAM'S NOT GOING.

13:10.470 --> 13:15.191
HE'S GOT A SCHOOL TO RUN.

13:15.240 --> 13:19.097
- HEY, GO TO DADDY.

13:19.140 --> 13:20.858
BABY, I THINK A SPIRITUAL
HEALING CENTER

13:20.900 --> 13:22.822
IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.134
GO UP THERE, GET A MASSAGE...
- MM-HMM.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.933
- SEAWEED WRAP OR SOMETHING.

13:27.970 --> 13:30.973
- WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS
THE RIDE THERE WILL BE RELAXING,

13:31.010 --> 13:33.217
WHICH IS MAYBE THE ONLY UPSIDE.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.353
- THE DRIVE.
THE DRIVE THERE.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.016
- NO, NO. I'M GONNA RIDE--
I'M GONNA RIDE THE MOTORCYCLE.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.392
IT'S PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY
BY THE WOODS.

13:39.430 --> 13:41.250
- NO, NO.
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE THE MINIVAN.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.574
YOU'RE NOT RIDING
THE MOTORCYCLE.

13:42.610 --> 13:44.919
WE JUST HAD
THAT DISCUSSION EARLIER TODAY.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.099
- NO, NO,
NO, WE DISCUSSED THAT THE BOY

13:47.130 --> 13:48.540
COULDN'T RIDE THE MOTORCYCLE,

13:48.580 --> 13:50.855
BUT I, AS A GROWN-ASS MAN,

13:50.890 --> 13:51.993
AM GONNA RIDE THE MOTORCYCLE.

13:52.030 --> 13:54.407
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA
DRIVE THE MINIVAN.

13:54.450 --> 13:57.101
- I AM NOT DRIVING THE MINIVAN.
- REALLY?

13:57.140 --> 14:00.075
- THERE'S NO WORLD IN WHICH I
AM DRIVING THAT MINIVAN.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.101
- CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN
FOR MY LI'ITLE NUGGET.

14:02.150 --> 14:04.869
- CROSBY'S GONNA GO TRY
AND FIND HIM AND TALK TO HIM.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.241
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU GUYS

14:06.290 --> 14:07.450
DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT
WITH HIM.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.899
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

14:08.950 --> 14:11.669
- MY LOCKER STICKS ON 23,
AND ALGEBRA SUCKS.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.428
- DON'T SAY "SUCKS".
THAT'S A--

14:13.470 --> 14:14.630
- THAT'S RIGHT.
DON'T SAY "SUCKS".

14:14.680 --> 14:15.817
- IT'S A BAD WORD.
- WHY CAN YOU SAY SUCKS?

14:15.850 --> 14:17.533
- DON'T SAY BAD WORDS
IN FRONT OF YOUR LI'ITLE SISTER.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.059
- "SUCKS" IS A VERB.
- HONEY, "SUCKS" IS A BAD WORD.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.534
- MAX, GO WORK ON YOUR LOCKER.
- HEY...

14:20.580 --> 14:22.059
I SAW YOU SITTING
WITH DYLAN TODAY,

14:22.100 --> 14:23.362
THE NEW GIRL, AT LUNCH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:23.410 --> 14:25.503
- SHE SEEMS LIKE
A VERY NICE GIRL.

14:25.550 --> 14:27.029
I'M HIS MOM.
I WANT TO ASK HIM, OKAY?

14:27.070 --> 14:27.855
I'M OFF THE CLOCK, RIGHT?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.413
- SHE CALLS ME ASPERGER'S,
NOT MAX.

14:29.450 --> 14:32.066
- WAIT--WHAT?
- WHAT?

14:32.110 --> 14:33.247
- SHE SAYS SHE KNOWS
THAT I HAVE ASPERGER'S

14:33.280 --> 14:36.909
BECAUSE I DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT
AND I SAY WEIRD THINGS.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.170
SHE ALSO SAYS MY ASPERGER'S IS
WHAT MAKES ME WEIRD.

14:39.220 --> 14:41.142
- SHE'S DOESN'T CALL YOU MAX?
SHE SAYS, "HEY, ASPERGER'S"?

14:41.190 --> 14:42.669
- YES, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAYS.

14:42.700 --> 14:43.940
- THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.
- THAT'S ACTUALLY UNACCEPTABLE,

14:43.980 --> 14:45.254
SO I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH HER.
- IT'S TIME TO CALL YOU MAX.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.018
- I MENTIONED IT, BUT SHE SAYS
SHE LIKE CALLING ME ASPERGER'S.

14:46.050 --> 14:49.087
SHE ALSO CALLS ME FREAK.
- WHAT?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.508
- AND SHE SAYS
THAT CHAMBERS ACADEMY

14:50.540 --> 14:52.644
IS A POTPOU'D'F! OF FREAKS.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.568
- SHE SAID IT WAS A POTPOURRI
OF FREAKS?

14:54.610 --> 14:56.020
- THOSE WERE HER EXACT WORDS.
- VERY INAPPROPRIATE.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.163
- OKAY.
- AND SHE ALSO AGREES WITH ME

14:57.200 --> 14:58.952
THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GO OFF CAMPUS FOR LUNCH,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.139
ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE'S
A CHIPOTLE TWO BLOCKS AWAY...

15:01.170 --> 15:02.614
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- AND THAT CHAMBERS ACADEMY

15:02.660 --> 15:04.412
IS THE EQUIVALENT
OF A MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON

15:04.450 --> 15:05.417
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
LET US LEAVE.

15:05.450 --> 15:06.929
- SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAD
QUITE A CONVERSATION

15:06.970 --> 15:07.959
WITH YOU, DIDN'T SHE?
- WOW. LOUDMOUTH.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.272
- ALSO, SINCE MY PARENTS
ARE THE ADMINISTRATORS,

15:09.320 --> 15:11.936
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SPECIAL
TREATMENT, LIKE LUNCH FOR LIFE.

15:11.980 --> 15:12.935
- SHE'S--
- AND IF I CAN'T,

15:12.980 --> 15:13.935
I SHOULD STICK IT TO THE MAN,

15:13.980 --> 15:17.040
AND YOU'RE THE MAN,
MOM--IN THAT SITUATION.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.661
- YOU'RE THE MAN.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.678
[door opens]

15:24.710 --> 15:26.268
- HEY. STILL HERE?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.291
- YEAH, I WAS
WAITING FOR YOU.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.365
- OH, HUH.
YOU NEVER DO THAT.

15:30.410 --> 15:33.231
- WELL, YOU HAD A COUPLE
OF MESSAGES WHILE YOU WERE OUT--

15:33.270 --> 15:34.953
I WANTED TO DELIVER PERSONALLY.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.331
EYE DOCTOR CALLED.

15:36.380 --> 15:38.234
YOU'RE DUE FOR A CHECKUP.
- OH. YEAH.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.272
- ELLIE PATEL IS CHANGING
HER SHOOT DAY.

15:41.310 --> 15:44.199
OH, AND YOUR EX-WIFE CAME BY.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.524
HEH.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.176
- CAME BY HERE WHEN--YOU TWO?
- YEAH, SHE WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.279
YEAH, WE HAD A NICE LITTLE CHAT.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.288
- HUH.

15:52.330 --> 15:53.979
THAT'S NOT AN IMAGE I LIKE.

15:54.020 --> 15:55.180
- YEAH.

15:55.230 --> 15:57.607
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK--LISTEN,
LISTEN, LISTEN--SHE'S CRAZY.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.221
OKAY?

15:59.260 --> 16:02.263
SO ANYTHING THAT SHE SAYS,
YOU JUST GOT A GRAIN OF SALT IT.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.643
- SO SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT AT ALL
WHEN SHE SAID

16:04.680 --> 16:08.309
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT
ME SPENDING ANY TIME WITH RUBY?

16:08.340 --> 16:10.683
- NO, SHE MEANT THAT.
- OKAY.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.029
BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT YOU HAD THAT CONVERSATION?

16:13.070 --> 16:14.298
- AND IT'S--
- SHE SAID SHE TOLD YOU THAT,

16:14.350 --> 16:16.409
AND I GUESS
YOU WERE OKAY WITH IT.

16:16.450 --> 16:21.171
- I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
EVERYBODY HAPPY AND SEPARATE.

16:21.220 --> 16:23.359
- I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN KEEP THINGS SEPARATE.

16:23.390 --> 16:25.278
WE'RE--YOU CAN'T KEEP EVERYONE
JUST, IN THEIR OWN LITTLE BOX.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.049
- WELL, WHAT DO I GOT
TO TELL HER ANYTHING FOR?

16:27.080 --> 16:29.082
IT'S MY RELATIONSHIP.
IT'S OUR RELATIONSHIP.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.769
- BECAUSE SHE SEEMS TO THINK
I'M SOME SORT OF ASSISTANT

16:30.810 --> 16:32.778
WITH SPECIAL BENEFITS.
- WELL, SHE'S WRONG.

16:32.810 --> 16:34.778
- I MEAN, SHE'S GOT
THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT ME.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.219
- OF COURSE SHE HAS THE WRONG
IDEA, 'CAUSE SHE'S CRAZY.

16:36.270 --> 16:37.817
- OKAY, WELL,
NOBODY CAN READ YOUR MIND,

16:37.850 --> 16:39.818
SO IT MIGHT BE
THE KIND OF THING

16:39.860 --> 16:42.328
THAT IS IMPORTANT
TO TALK ABOUT.

16:42.380 --> 16:43.824
- I CAN'T.
SHE JUST--

16:43.860 --> 16:48.752
- MM-HMM?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.722
- I GO IN, AND I THINK
I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO SAY,

16:50.760 --> 16:54.457
AND SHE JUST KEEPS TALKING
AND TALKING,

16:54.490 --> 16:56.378
AND SUDDENLY I'M AGREEING
TO THINGS

16:56.420 --> 17:00.834
THAT I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.496
I CAN'T TALK TO HER.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.476
I'LL TALK TO HER.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.785
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
HOW HARD CAN IT BE?

17:15.820 --> 17:18.129
- AND WHEN RON SAID
SHE WAS OUT OF CONTROL--

17:18.170 --> 17:19.785
- I KNOW.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.616
- MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
TO THE THERAPIST, OR--

17:21.660 --> 17:24.823
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO. ITHINK
SHE IS OUT OF CONTROL, THOUGH.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.792
'CAUSE WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

17:26.830 --> 17:29.651
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.168
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE WE STALLING?

17:32.220 --> 17:36.566
THE UNCERTAINTY OF US
IS TOO MUCH FOR HER.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.875
- I GET IT.
IT'S BEEN HARD ON BOTH THE KIDS,

17:38.910 --> 17:43.199
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING
THE BEST WE CAN HERE.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.744
- I DON'T--I MEAN,
I THOUGHT THAT YOU MOVING OUT

17:45.780 --> 17:47.293
WOULD BE THE HARDEST PART
OF THIS FOR THEM,

17:47.340 --> 17:49.786
BUT THIS IS WORSE.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.573
THEY'RE JUST IN LIMBO.

17:52.620 --> 17:55.828
WE--WE HAVE TO GIVE
THEM SOME CLARITY.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.586
[dog barking]

18:02.630 --> 18:05.793
OKAY?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.456
- HEH.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.218
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:15.810 --> 18:17.778
- OKAY, WE NEED TO TELL THEM

18:17.820 --> 18:19.776
WE'RE NOT GETTING BACK
TOGETHER.

18:28.270 --> 18:33.515
- YOU READY--YOU READY
TO SAY THAT TO THEM?

18:52.610 --> 18:55.738
- YO, ASPERGER'S,
WHAT'S UP?

18:55.780 --> 18:59.853
- HEY, DYLAN, CAN YOU PLEASE
COME HERE FOR A MOMENT?

18:59.890 --> 19:01.778
- IS THIS MY FIRST TRIP
TO THE OFFICE?

19:03.790 --> 19:04.859
- CAN YOU HAVE A SEAT?

19:04.900 --> 19:06.822
- OH, I PREFER TO STAND.

19:06.860 --> 19:07.827
- I'M SORRY?

19:07.870 --> 19:09.826
- I PREFER TO STAND.

19:09.870 --> 19:11.178
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.381
- OKAY, WELL,
I'M GONNA HAVE A SEAT.

19:12.420 --> 19:15.309
- OKAY.
- SO, HERE'S THE THING, HONEY.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.693
AT CHAMBERS ACADEMY, WE DON'T
CALL EACH OTHER NAMES, OKAY?

19:18.740 --> 19:20.423
WE TREAT EACH OTHER
WITH KINDNESS,

19:20.460 --> 19:22.701
AND RESPECT, AND DIGNITY.
- UH-HUH.

19:22.740 --> 19:24.423
- OKAY, DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT?

19:24.470 --> 19:25.914
- SURE.
- PERFECT.

19:25.950 --> 19:28.327
- BUT I DIDN'T DISRESPECT MAX.
- WELL--

19:28.370 --> 19:29.814
- NO, YOUR SON HAS ASPERGER'S.

19:29.850 --> 19:31.124
THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE FACT.
I MEAN,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.229
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
CELEBRATE OUR DIFFERENCES HERE.

19:33.270 --> 19:35.579
LOOK, I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM
IS ATTACHING STIGMA TO THE WORD.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.338
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
DEROGATORY.

19:37.380 --> 19:38.779
ASPERGER'S BY ITSELF--

19:38.830 --> 19:40.821
THAT'S JUST A DSM-5 DIAGNOSIS,
KRISTINA.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.930
- ACTUALLY, IT USED TO BE
A DSM-4 DIAGNOSIS,

19:42.970 --> 19:44.858
BUT IT'S NOT ANYMORE.
AND DON'T CALL ME KRISTINA.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.969
CALL ME MRS. BRAVERMAN.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.934
WE GO BY MR. OR MRS.,
OR MS. FOR STAFF TEACHERS.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.459
- YEAH, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RETHINK THAT.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.697
THE FIRST NAME THING
WORKED GREAT AT MY LAST SCHOOL.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.560
IT'S TOTALLY PROGRESSIVE.
THE KIDS REALLY RESPONDED.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.771
- THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO HERE.

19:55.810 --> 19:57.220
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE DO HERE.
- OKAY.

19:57.260 --> 19:58.568
- OKAY?
- SORRY.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.009
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

20:00.060 --> 20:02.631
- YOU'RE DISMISSED.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.329
- OH, SO I CAN GO?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.712
- GO TO CLASS.
- OKAY.

20:05.750 --> 20:06.956
THANK YOU, MRS. BRAVERMAN.
- THANK YOU.

20:10.830 --> 20:15.722
- OH.
GOSH, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.888
IT'S SO GOOD SHE DOESN'T HAVE
HER FATHER'S NOSE.

20:18.940 --> 20:21.579
- [laughs]
THANK GOD FOR THAT.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.688
HOW'S HE DOING?

20:25.740 --> 20:26.695
- HE'S OKAY.

20:26.740 --> 20:29.561
HE'S OUT OF TOWN
PUTTING OUT A FIRE FOR WORK.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.352
- IT'S SO COOL
THAT YOU HAVE YOUR BED

20:31.400 --> 20:33.630
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE LIVING ROOM, GRANDPA.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.808
- YEAH, IT IS COOL,

20:36.850 --> 20:38.989
HEY, JABBAR,

20:41.790 --> 20:44.998

ABOUT THE ICE TEA RELAY THING?

20:45.030 --> 20:46.713
- NO.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.614

24:54.350 --> 24:56.318
BACK AT LAW SCHOOL
OR SOMETHING.

24:56.350 --> 24:57.271
- WHO IS IT?

25:07.980 --> 25:09.083
NO, NO, NO,

HEY, HEY, HEY,

25:16.100 --> 25:17.294
- LET GO OF THE SCISSORS.

25:17.340 --> 25:18.614

25:18.650 --> 25:19.503
SO I DIDN'T MESS IT UP.

25:19.550 --> 25:20.539
LET YOU GRIP GO.
JUST GIVE THEM TO ME.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.059

THANK YOU, I'LL TAKE THOSE.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.009
- I DON'T WANT TO
START A BOY BAND.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.268
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO START
A BOY BAND,

25:31.320 --> 25:32.651
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO CUT YOUR HAIR.

25:32.700 --> 25:33.860
- I DON'T WANT TO--
I DON'T WANT TO--

25:33.910 --> 25:35.866
- YOU'RE NOT CUTTING YOUR HAIR.
- WOW.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.628
- OH MY GOD.
THIS KID IS DOING IT.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.013
SHE'S CLEARLY MANIPULATING HIM,
HONEY, OKAY?

25:40.050 --> 25:41.153
- SHE'S NOT MANIPULATING.
- NO, SHE IS.

25:41.190 --> 25:42.976
DR. PELIKAN SAID
THIS WOULD HAPPEN, OKAY?

25:43.020 --> 25:44.749
SHE'S TREATING HIM
LIKE HER LITTLE MASCOT--

25:44.780 --> 25:46.259
TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO,
WHAT TO WEAR,

25:46.300 --> 25:47.506
HOW DO ACT,
CALLING HIM ASPERGER'S--

25:47.540 --> 25:48.677
- I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT
COMPLICATED, THAT THEY'RE--

25:48.710 --> 25:49.642
I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING PROTECTIVE
AS A MOTHER RIGHT NOW,

25:49.680 --> 25:51.784
BUT SHE HAS HER ISSUES,
HE HAS HIS ISSUES.

25:51.820 --> 25:53.230
- I AM PROTECTIVE.
SHE--HIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS HER.

25:53.270 --> 25:54.919
- I WILL TALK TO HIM.
- LISTEN TO ME.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.134
I DO NOT WANT WHAT HAPPENED
LAST YEAR TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

25:58.170 --> 25:59.751
- LOOK, SHE DIDN'T PEE
IN HIS CANTEEN, LISTEN TO ME.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.997
- BULLYING--THIS IS
WHY WE STARTED CHAMBERS.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.587
- KRISTINA, I WILL TALK TO HIM.
- I'M TELLING YOU.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.348
- I WILL LET HIM KNOW
HE'S THE BOSS OF HIS OWN HAIR.

26:05.390 --> 26:06.766
- HE'S THE BOSS OF HIS OWN HAIR.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.244
HIS HAIR IS GORGEOUS.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.246
- I WILL TALK TO HIM.

26:18.850 --> 26:20.078
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

26:20.130 --> 26:22.360
BUT I FEEL FULLY SOUND-BATHED,
YOU KNOW?

26:22.400 --> 26:24.220
SONICALLY CLEANSED TO THE MAX.

26:24.270 --> 26:25.362
- YES.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.332
- HEY, THANKS FOR INVITING ME
TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

26:27.370 --> 26:28.951
I FEEL REALLY CLOSE TO YOU NOW,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.400
ESPECIALLY Al-TER THAT WEIRD YOGA
EXERCISE WE DID.

26:31.450 --> 26:33.372
- MM-HMM.
- IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON

26:33.410 --> 26:36.299
THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE DON'T LOSE YOU.

26:36.350 --> 26:37.863
SO YOU GOT TO TELL ME,
WHAT DID ADAM AND I--

26:37.900 --> 26:38.559
- SHH.
- GOT YOU.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.034
I'LL BE SHUSH IN ONE SECOND.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.274
YOU GOT TO TELL ME WHAT DO ADAM

26:41.320 --> 26:43.629
AND I HAVE TO DO TO KEEP YOU
FROM SIGNING WITH SUB MODO.

26:43.670 --> 26:44.864
YEAH, I HEAR YOU.
I HEAR YOU.

26:44.910 --> 26:46.354
- SHH.

26:46.390 --> 26:47.288
YOU CAN SHUSH ALL DAY LATER.

26:47.320 --> 26:51.973
- I ALREADY SIGNED
WITH SUB MODO, MAN.

26:52.020 --> 26:53.328
- YOU DON'T SIGN WITH--

26:53.370 --> 26:54.223
YOU'RE SAYING YOU ALREADY
SIGNED WITH SUB MODO?

26:54.260 --> 26:56.148
YOU TOLD YOU WERE IN TALKS
WITH THEM.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.155
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- SHH.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.019
- HAVE YOU SIGNED--YEAH, YEAH,
I HEARD YOU.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.675
I HEARD YOU FIRST 25 TIMES.
- SHH.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.857
- YEAH,

27:00.890 --> 27:01.743
AND THOSE TALKS CONCLUDED TIGHT
BEFORE YOU CAME HERE.

27:01.790 --> 27:03.052
- YOU ALREADY SIGNED?
- BEFORE I GOT--

27:03.100 --> 27:05.648
- SO I JUST SPENT THE NIGHT WITH
RIP VAN WINKLE FOR NO REASON?

27:05.690 --> 27:07.339
- SHH-SHH-SHH.
- WHAT ARE YOU SHUSHING?

27:07.380 --> 27:08.824
SHUT UP!
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.236
YOU'RE MAKING IT LOUDER.
DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT?

27:10.280 --> 27:11.963
- NO, THIS IS GOOD,
BUT YOU GOT TO LET IT GO.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.934
- THIS IS GOOD. YOU KNOW HOW I
KNOW THIS WHOLE THING'S CRAP?

27:13.970 --> 27:15.699
BECAUSE THIS IS ONE
OF YOUR MEMBERS.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.004
THIS GUY'S A FRAUD.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.736
WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT STOOD
BY YOU WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.214
WE RECORDED YOU.

27:21.260 --> 27:23.046
WE GAVE YOU YOUR CAREER,
AND THIS IS HOW YOU THANK ME?

27:23.080 --> 27:25.469
- LET IT GO, MAN.
- YEAH, HEY, HE TALKED.

27:25.500 --> 27:26.910
HE TALKED. GIVE HIM A DEMERIT!

27:26.950 --> 27:28.019
- YOU'RE RUINING
THIS FOR EVERYBODY!

27:28.060 --> 27:29.869
- ALL RIGHT, HE'S TALKING NOW!

27:29.920 --> 27:31.740
KORESH,
WHEN DOES THE KOOL-AID COME OUT?

27:31.780 --> 27:34.340
LET'S DO IT. LET'S LIGHT
THIS PLACE ON FIRE, OKAY?

27:34.370 --> 27:35.780
YOU GUYS WANT TO BE CLEANSED?

27:35.820 --> 27:38.755
I FEEL CLEAN!
I FEEL CLEAN!

27:38.790 --> 27:40.234
WHOO!

27:40.270 --> 27:44.206
THIS IS HORSE CRAP
AND YOU KNOW IT!

27:44.240 --> 27:47.209
- HEY.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.002
OKAY, SO YOU WANT TO TALK?
LET'S TALK.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.860
- I'VE GOT TO GO FIRST.

27:50.910 --> 27:53.242
LET ME GO--PLEASE LET
ME GO FIRST, IF IT'S OKAY.

27:53.290 --> 27:55.281
I'VE GOT TO GO FIRST.
- I--GO.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.379
- OKAY.

27:57.430 --> 28:02.185
OKAY, LOOK, YOU--YOU AND I--

28:02.230 --> 28:04.255
UH, NOT YOU AND I.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.269
NOT YOU AND I. RUBY,
SHE--THAT'S--RUBY'S--

28:07.300 --> 28:08.153
- DID YOU NEED ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

28:08.200 --> 28:09.406
- WE'RE OKAY. WE'RE OKAY.
THANK YOU.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.192
OKAY.

28:11.240 --> 28:14.266
RUBY--I WANT HER--

28:14.310 --> 28:17.347
I WANT HER--

28:17.380 --> 28:19.302
- OKAY,
WHAT'S GOING ON, HANK?

28:23.460 --> 28:26.315
- SARAH'S WHAT'S GOING ON.

28:26.350 --> 28:28.807
- SARAH? I THOUGHT WE CAME
TO TALK ABOUT RUBY.

28:28.840 --> 28:29.875
- THE THING IS,
THAT IT'S--LISTEN.

28:29.910 --> 28:31.764
SARAH AND I AREN'T
JUST DATING.

28:31.810 --> 28:33.903
WE AREN'T JUST HAVING--

28:33.950 --> 28:38.182
WE'RE NOT JUST
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

28:38.230 --> 28:40.050
IT'S SERIOUS, SANDY.

28:40.090 --> 28:41.330
AND WE'RE COMMITTED
TO EACH OTHER,

28:41.370 --> 28:44.988
AND THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA STAY.

28:45.030 --> 28:47.749
AT LEAST, I HOPE TO GOD
THAT'S THE WAY IT STAYS.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.926
SARAH'S A BIG PART
OF MY LIFE--

28:55.590 --> 29:00.482
SHE'S GONNA BE
A PART OF RUBY'S.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.100
I WANT THAT.

29:02.150 --> 29:06.075
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.437
- OKAY.

29:18.890 --> 29:21.404
- OKAY?

29:21.440 --> 29:23.237
- YEAH. OKAY.

29:23.270 --> 29:25.579
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU
AND SARAH WERE SERIOUS.

29:25.620 --> 29:30.796
NOW I KNOW, SO...OKAY.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.104
- HEH.

29:32.140 --> 29:33.277
OKAY.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.146
GOOD TALK.

29:36.180 --> 29:39.388
- [chuckles]

29:39.430 --> 29:40.567
[door opens]

29:40.600 --> 29:42.568
- HEY, POP.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.841
- HEY.
- LOOKING GOOD.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.108
- YEAH. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

29:48.130 --> 29:50.155
- YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?

29:50.200 --> 29:52.475
- YOUR MOT'TNEC'; CALL YOU?

29:52.510 --> 29:54.239
- SEE, YOUR SISTER
SARAH WAS JUST HERE,

29:54.270 --> 29:56.192
AND SHE THREW YOUR MOTHER
UNDER THE BUS,

29:56.240 --> 29:57.855
AND THAT TOOK ABOUT TWO
SECONDS, SO--

29:57.890 --> 29:59.539
- THIS IS MY BRILLIANT IDEA.
- UH-HUH.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.990
- I THINK WE SHOULD GET
SOME BLOOD FLOWING.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.486
- CAN'T DO IT, HONEY.
I'M VERY, VERY BUSY.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.203
GOT A JOHN WAYNE MARATHON GOING.

30:06.250 --> 30:07.581
IT'S BEEN ON CABLE ALL WEEK.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.552
IN FACT, IT'S THE SECOND TIME
AROUND THE HORN FOR ME.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.591
- SECOND TIME?
- YEAH.

30:11.630 --> 30:14.872
- THAT IS THE PERFECT REASON
TO GET SOME BLOOD FLOWING.

30:14.910 --> 30:18.357
- ROOSTER COGBURN'S ABOUT
TO TEAM UP WITH EULA GOODNIGHT.

30:24.650 --> 30:29.929
- WHICH ONE IS ROOSTER COGBURN?

30:29.960 --> 30:32.303
I DON'T--
- WELL, YEAH.

30:32.340 --> 30:35.207
WELL, YOU SHOULD.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.992
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU, KID?

30:37.040 --> 30:38.348
- OH, YOU KNOW,

30:38.380 --> 30:41.349
JUST DOING WHAT I DO--

30:41.390 --> 30:43.312
RUINING MY KIDS' LIVES.

30:43.350 --> 30:44.590
- PARENTS SCREW THEIR KIDS UP.

30:44.630 --> 30:46.450
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT IS, HONEY.

30:46.490 --> 30:50.449
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY
SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, I THINK.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.152
DOESN'T MATTER--MARRIED,
DIVORCED, WHATEVER.

30:54.190 --> 30:55.361
YOU JUST SCREW THEM UP.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.018
THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF IT,
YOU KNOW?

30:59.060 --> 31:02.336
SO DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SO SPECIAL.

31:02.370 --> 31:04.679
HONEY, THE ONLY WAY
NOT TO SCREW THEM UP

31:04.720 --> 31:06.608
IS NOT TO HAVE THEM.

31:06.650 --> 31:10.370
WHAT A SHAME THAT WOULD BE.
- YEAH.

31:10.420 --> 31:14.004
- HEH.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.339
I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING, GIRL.

31:17.390 --> 31:20.245
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BEST MOMS
I KNOW.

31:20.290 --> 31:22.599
I MEAN, YOU'RE LOVING.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.598
YOU'RE COM PASSIONATE.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.153
YOU HAVE SUCH A BIG HEART.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.320
AND SYDNEY
AND VICTOR, THEY KNOW THAT.

31:29.370 --> 31:33.397
THEY TRUST YOU.
THEY LOVE YOU.

31:33.440 --> 31:38.366
YOU'VE BEEN THAT WAY
SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL.

31:38.410 --> 31:41.538
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, KID.

31:44.730 --> 31:46.231
- THANKS.

31:47.310 --> 31:48.311
- CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

31:48.350 --> 31:50.033
- YEAH.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.310
- YOU PUT YOUR HEAD
ON MY SHOULDER?

32:10.720 --> 32:13.336
- IT'S JUST--
HE'S SO STUBBORN.

32:13.370 --> 32:17.329
- YEAH. WELL, HE WAS THAT WAY
BEFORE THE SURGERY, MOM.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.371
- I JUST CAN'T GET HIM GOING.
- UH-HUH.

32:19.420 --> 32:22.207
- EVERY LITTLE SUGGESTION
I MAKE, HE SNAPS AT ME.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.037
I MEAN, WE SHOULD HAVE
LEI-T THE BED UPSTAIRS.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.002
- WHY?
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.076
- BECAUSE THEN HE'D HAVE
TO MOVE.

32:29.110 --> 32:30.429
HE'D HAVE TO MOVE.

32:30.460 --> 32:32.075
NOW HE GOES FROM THE BED
TO THE COUCH,

32:32.120 --> 32:33.348
BACK TO THE BED AGAIN.

32:33.390 --> 32:35.278
- MM-HMM.
- WE MADE IT TOO EASY ON HIM.

32:35.330 --> 32:36.638
- JUST GIVE IT
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

32:36.670 --> 32:37.739
HE'LL GET THERE.

32:37.780 --> 32:41.398
- OH, ADAM,
ALL OUR LIFE TOGETHER,

32:41.440 --> 32:45.262
THERE WAS NOT EVER
A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE

32:45.300 --> 32:46.540
THAT HE WOULDN'T TACKLE.

32:46.580 --> 32:49.128
- RIGHT.

32:49.170 --> 32:52.162
- NOW HE JUST SITS THERE.

32:54.310 --> 32:57.723
I THOUGHT THE HARD PART OF THIS
WAS GONNA BE KEEPING HIM DOWN.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.648
- MOM, HE'S GONNA GET STRONGER.

32:59.700 --> 33:05.218
IT'S JUST TAKING HIM LONGER.

33:05.250 --> 33:07.389
- I THINK HE'S AFRAID TO TRY.

33:13.710 --> 33:18.409
I'M AFRAID HE'S GIVING UP.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.431
- OH, MOM. COME ON.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.306
COME HERE.

33:25.340 --> 33:27.820
COME HERE, MOM.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.203
- [sniffles]

33:30.240 --> 33:33.721
- IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

33:40.290 --> 33:42.451
- YEAH, SO, IT'S KIND
OF A FIRST FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

33:42.500 --> 33:43.706
NICE.
- YEAH.

33:43.740 --> 33:46.322
- I MEAN, I SAID MORE WORDS
THAN HER, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

33:46.360 --> 33:48.089
AND THEY ALL KIND OF
MADE SENSE.

33:48.120 --> 33:50.816
- HEY. GOOD JOB.

33:50.850 --> 33:52.431
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
- REALLY.

33:52.470 --> 33:54.222
- DON'T--I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

33:54.270 --> 33:56.124
- IT'S A BIG DEAL.
- WELL, I'M GLAD.

33:56.170 --> 33:58.058
I'M GLAD YOU'RE, YOU KNOW--

33:58.100 --> 33:59.510
YOU'RE OUT OF THE BOX NOW.

33:59.550 --> 34:02.064
- I'M OUT OF THE BOX. YEAH.
- YOU KNOW?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.727
I MEAN, BETWEEN YOU AND RUBY--
[knock on door]

34:03.760 --> 34:07.480

HELLO.

34:14.810 --> 34:16.186

- ALL RIGHT.

34:16.220 --> 34:19.212
- OKAY. GOOD LUCK.

34:19.260 --> 34:20.329
- HEY, DID YOU WANT TO--

34:20.360 --> 34:21.679
YEAH, HELP YOURSELF.

34:21.710 --> 34:25.396
SO, RUBY,
I THOUGHT WE'D DO A PIZZA NIGHT.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.884
YOU CAN--ANY TOPPINGS YOU WANT.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.366
YOU CAN DO, LIKE,
A MEAT LOVER, CHEESE LOVER--

34:29.410 --> 34:31.093
- I DON'T DO DAIRY.

34:31.130 --> 34:32.301
- OH, DAMN.
STILL?

34:32.340 --> 34:33.500
SEE, I THOUGHT--I KNEW THAT--

34:33.550 --> 34:35.097
AH, SHE JUST HAS--
- THAT'S OKAY.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.129
WELL, THERE'S PLENTY OF STUFF
THAT ISN'T DAIRY.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.853
- CHEESELESS--YOU EVER
HAD A CH EESELESS PIZZA--

34:37.900 --> 34:39.231
WHICH IS REALLY BREAD?
- EXACTLY. YES.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.896
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
- WHAT?

34:41.940 --> 34:43.862
- IS THAT FOREVER 21?

34:43.900 --> 34:49.349
- NO. IT'S SOMETIMES 40,
I GUESS.

34:49.390 --> 34:53.349
- NICE TRY.
- THANKS.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.779
- IT'S A VALIANT EFFORT.

34:56.810 --> 34:58.675
- WHAT IS--WHAT'S MAYBE 20?
WHAT IS IT?

34:58.710 --> 35:02.259
- IT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.541
- I MEAN, YOU LOOK--
YOU LOOK FINE TO ME.

35:04.580 --> 35:05.854
[door closes]
YOU--

35:05.890 --> 35:07.881
- DON'T.

35:13.420 --> 35:15.559
- HEY, BUD.
CAN WE TALK FOR A SECOND?

35:15.590 --> 35:18.866
- NO.
THIS IS MY SCREEN TIME.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.596
- I WILL CREDIT
YOU ONE HOUR, OKAY?

35:22.810 --> 35:24.835
- THAT'S FAIR.

35:24.880 --> 35:29.158
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON AT SCHOOL?

35:29.190 --> 35:30.919
- WHY DO YOU AND MOM
KEEP ASKING ME THAT?

35:30.950 --> 35:32.565
- WELL, IT'S A NEW SITUATION.

35:32.610 --> 35:34.430
I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU
CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING

35:34.470 --> 35:36.745
THAT IS OF INTEREST TO YOU,

35:36.780 --> 35:41.126
OR IF SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU
AT SCHOOL--OR SOMEONE.

35:45.690 --> 35:49.274
LIKE, MAYBE DYLAN?

35:49.310 --> 35:52.791
OR IF IT'S OKAY,
THEN IT'S OKAY.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.458
- ARE YOU HERE AS
AN ADMINISTRATOR OR AS A PARENT?

35:56.490 --> 35:57.969
- I'M HERE AS YOUR DAD, MAX--

35:58.010 --> 36:00.387
JUST AS YOUR DAD.

36:00.430 --> 36:02.182
- THEN I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.630
- ALL RIGHT.

36:03.670 --> 36:07.879
ANYTHING. GO AHEAD, SHOOT.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.844
- WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU LIKE A GIRL?

36:16.820 --> 36:21.848
- UM...OKAY.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.755
- I ONLY HAD TWO PIECES.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.960
- I THINK I HAD SEVEN.
HOW MANY DID YOU HAVE?

36:26.010 --> 36:26.931
- DAD.

36:26.970 --> 36:28.858
- HEY.

36:28.910 --> 36:31.970
- HEY, YOU LEI-T THIS IN THE BACK
OF THE TRUCK.

36:32.010 --> 36:32.908
- OKAY.
- HEY, DAD.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.077
- I KNOW YOU WANT IT
FOR THE BIG GAME,

36:34.120 --> 36:36.566
AND--OH, BY THE WAY, I
DIDN'T SEE YOUR GLOVE IN THERE,

36:36.600 --> 36:37.840
SO YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK IT.
- OH, OKAY.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.222
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER SOMETIME.
- COOL ENOUGH.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.319
ARE YOU STAYING FOR DINNER, OR--

36:41.370 --> 36:42.985
- NO, BUDDY.
I'M NOT STAYING.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.908
- OKAY.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.849
- WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA STAY, DAD?

36:47.890 --> 36:49.471
- WELL--

36:49.510 --> 36:50.852
- SYDNEY, COME HERE.
COME HERE.

36:54.930 --> 36:56.579
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME.

36:56.620 --> 36:57.723
I KNOW IT'S HARD

36:57.760 --> 37:02.038
NOT KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH ME AND YOUR DAD.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.664
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT,

37:05.700 --> 37:08.669
AND--
- HEY.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.429
- AND WE'RE SORRY.

37:10.460 --> 37:13.805
I WISH I COULD JUST TELL
YOU RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING,

37:13.850 --> 37:17.889
BUT THE TRUTH
IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

37:23.750 --> 37:24.956
WE JUST REALLY
WANT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.891
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS, SO--

37:28.930 --> 37:33.412
OH, SWEETHEART,
YOU AND ME ARE SO ALIKE.

37:33.450 --> 37:36.999
I KNOW I HATE UNCERTAINTY.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.928
I HATE FEELING
LIKE I'M OUT OF CONTROL.

37:38.980 --> 37:40.663
I--SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.941
IT'S JUST--

37:42.980 --> 37:45.631
- IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS,
BUG, I'M SORRY TOO.

37:45.670 --> 37:47.877
IT'S JUST--I KNOW,
BUT IT'S SOMETHING

37:47.920 --> 37:48.989
THAT GROWN-UPS
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

37:49.020 --> 37:51.773
- HEY, SYD, SYD, DON'T RUN
AWAY FROM THIS, PLEASE.

37:51.820 --> 37:53.879
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.364
- OKAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

37:55.410 --> 37:59.540
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT IF YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

37:59.580 --> 38:02.401
IT'S OKAY.

38:02.450 --> 38:03.963
AND IF YOU'RE MAD AT DAD,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.685
IT'S OKAY.

38:06.730 --> 38:09.585
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.083
[minivan pulls up]

38:25.950 --> 38:27.952
[door opens and closes]

38:41.970 --> 38:43.961
[motorcycle rewing]

38:51.120 --> 38:54.977
- HEY! CROSBY!

39:02.130 --> 39:04.098
[door opens]

39:04.130 --> 39:06.360
- OH, WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.810
- BOY, DO YOU LOOK LIFE CRAP.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.408
- YEAH, WELL--HEY,
DID YOU LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN?

39:11.450 --> 39:12.894
- I DID.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.488
- COULD YOU JUST TAKE YOUR ASS
RIGHT BACK OUT AGAIN?

39:14.520 --> 39:15.964
- I CAN CALL IT
LIKE I SEE IT, YOU KNOW?

39:16.000 --> 39:16.864
- YEAH, WELL,
LIKE YOU SEE IT--YEAH.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.937
- I HAD CANCER,
SO I GET A FREE PASS.

39:19.970 --> 39:21.938
- YOU'RE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.834
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

39:23.870 --> 39:25.451
- HOW YOU DOING?

39:25.500 --> 39:28.526
- WELL, KRISTINA,
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

39:28.570 --> 39:30.538
- SUCKS, DOESN'T IT?
- UH-HUH.

39:30.570 --> 39:31.912
- I THINK THE CRAPPIEST PART

39:31.950 --> 39:36.887
ABOUT BEING SICK
FOR ME WAS JUST THE PEOPLE.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.535
I KNOW IT SOUNDS SO WEIRD,

39:38.580 --> 39:41.128
BUT THE PEOPLE
JUST REALLY PISSED ME OFF.

39:41.170 --> 39:44.640
THE SAD FACES AND ALL THE PITY,

39:44.690 --> 39:46.851
AND THE FALSE SENSE OF CHEER--

39:46.900 --> 39:48.959
"WE CAN DO THIS."
THE "WE'S".

39:49.000 --> 39:50.206
- WE--WE--
- THE "WE'S".

39:50.240 --> 39:51.719
RIGHT?
- OH, YEAH.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.556
WE CAN WALK.
WE CAN--

39:52.590 --> 39:53.898
- WE CAN DO IT, RIGHT?

39:53.940 --> 39:55.931
- AND ALL THAT.

39:55.970 --> 39:58.768
- YEAH.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.828
I THINK THE HARDEST PART

40:01.880 --> 40:06.010
WAS JUST KNOWING HOW SICK
THAT I ACTUALLY WAS

40:06.050 --> 40:08.917
AND HOW I FELT SO AWFUL
ALL THE TIME,

40:08.950 --> 40:14.126
AND JUST HOW--
HOW SCARED I WAS.

40:14.170 --> 40:16.161
YOU KNOW?

40:22.000 --> 40:24.446
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PRETEND

40:24.490 --> 40:25.889
TO BE STRONGER THAN YOU FEEL.
- GOD.

40:25.940 --> 40:27.828
- YOU DON'T.

40:27.870 --> 40:30.486
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY
TO GET BETTER.

40:30.530 --> 40:33.112
- OH, GOD.
- YOU HAVE TO TRY.

40:33.150 --> 40:36.119
YOU GOT IT?
- YEAH.

40:36.150 --> 40:37.833
- 'CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE COUNTING ON YOU.

40:37.880 --> 40:42.010
- OKAY.

40:42.060 --> 40:44.506
OH, GOD.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.532
OKAY.

40:51.690 --> 40:55.968
GET ME UP.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.036
OKAY.

40:58.070 --> 41:00.277
- OKAY? COME ON.
- YEAH.

41:00.310 --> 41:05.589
- YOU'RE GONNA NEED

41:05.630 --> 41:12.638
ALL THE HELP
YOU CAN GET

41:12.840 --> 41:17.868
SO LII-T UP YOUR ARMS NOW

41:17.920 --> 41:24.928
AND REACH FOR IT

41:29.900 --> 41:33.927
