Previously on <i>Damages...</i>

00:04.732 --> 00:07.691
<i>I ran into your mom at
the Hudson Square Pharmacy.</i>

00:07.832 --> 00:08.606
<i>You're working here now?</i>

00:08.608 --> 00:10.541
<i>Just for the past few months.</i>

00:10.543 --> 00:12.309
<i>Mom, what do you need?</i>

00:12.311 --> 00:13.077
<i>Can I stay with you?</i>

00:13.079 --> 00:14.678
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:17.581
<i>Personal e-mails
reveal traders' sexcapades.</i>

00:17.583 --> 00:19.884
<i>How did Ms. Walling's
information get out there?</i>

00:19.886 --> 00:22.753
<i>I don't know, but it is
very bad for my organization.</i>

00:22.755 --> 00:25.289
<i>Last night Naomi
Walling took her own life.</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:27.391
<i>In order for the
standard of wrongful death to</i>

00:27.393 --> 00:29.593
<i>apply, the plaintiff has to
prove that you leaked her</i>

00:29.595 --> 00:31.562
<i>personal information
with malice.</i>

00:31.564 --> 00:33.497
<i>Naomi had agreed
to provide information.</i>

00:33.499 --> 00:35.132
<i>Why would Channing want
to embarrass her?</i>

00:35.134 --> 00:37.334
<i>We need money to pay
for the attorney.</i>

00:37.336 --> 00:38.769
<i>You said this would be
dismissed quickly.</i>

00:38.771 --> 00:40.571
<i>Can you help with
the funding or not?</i>

00:40.573 --> 00:41.872
<i>I'll see what I can arrange.</i>

00:41.874 --> 00:44.275
<i>Your leak-- you don't
know the whole story.</i>

00:44.277 --> 00:45.709
<i>I could get you a lot more.</i>

00:45.711 --> 00:47.711
<i>Have you ever known
me to pay for information?</i>

00:47.713 --> 00:51.193
<i>You don't want to be in the dark
when this breaks somewhere else.</i>

00:55.052 --> 00:57.093
<i>You know you're not
supposed to play with this.</i>

01:05.129 --> 01:07.564
<i>I need that research, Bill.</i>

01:07.566 --> 01:09.333
<i>Got it right here.</i>

01:12.704 --> 01:15.439
<i>Good afternoon,
Ms. Hewes.</i>

01:17.809 --> 01:22.846
<i>Catherine, you're
sitting in Grandma's chair.</i>

01:24.416 --> 01:27.551

01:42.033 --> 01:48.172
<i>You're not the one who's
supposed to be there.</i>

01:48.174 --> 01:51.709
<i>Get... off.</i>

01:51.711 --> 01:52.776
<i>Get... off.</i>

01:52.778 --> 01:55.446
<i>You're not my mommy.</i>

01:55.448 --> 01:57.815
<i>Get the fuck off!</i>

01:57.817 --> 01:59.717
<i>I love you, Mommy.</i>

02:10.428 --> 02:12.463
<i>So, are there any men
in your life these days,</i>

02:12.465 --> 02:15.299
<i>recreationally speaking?</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:16.367
<i>No.</i>

02:16.369 --> 02:19.236
<i>You still smarting
over the Phil thing?</i>

02:19.238 --> 02:20.604
<i>Not at all.</i>

02:20.606 --> 02:21.805
<i>No, that's good.</i>

02:21.807 --> 02:23.273
<i>You know, I got friends who are</i>

02:23.275 --> 02:24.408
<i>always trying to set me up with</i>

02:24.410 --> 02:28.946
<i>younger women, and they
bore the crap out of me.</i>

02:28.948 --> 02:32.149
<i>Oh. Sorry to hear that.</i>

02:32.151 --> 02:35.219
<i>So, back to business.</i>

02:35.221 --> 02:36.854
<i>What do you think?</i>

02:36.856 --> 02:40.457
<i>Oh, I don't know, Roger.</i>

02:40.459 --> 02:43.160
<i>I mean, obviously,
I'm flattered.</i>

02:43.162 --> 02:44.028
<i>Flattered?</i>

02:44.030 --> 02:46.397
<i>We're talking about the fucking
U.S. Supreme Court.</i>

02:46.399 --> 02:50.534
<i>You're goddamn right you
should be flattered.</i>

02:50.536 --> 02:53.904
<i>The administration just wants
to know if you'd consider it.</i>

02:53.906 --> 02:55.272
<i>Ginsburg could retire any day.</i>

02:55.274 --> 03:00.411
<i>They need to get their
ducks in a row.</i>

03:00.413 --> 03:05.783
<i>I'm not saying no, but
I need to close out this</i>

03:05.785 --> 03:08.585
<i>McClaren case and
then we'll see.</i>

03:08.587 --> 03:09.253
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:09.255 --> 03:12.156
<i>My faith in the fundamental sanity
of the world remains intact.</i>

03:12.158 --> 03:13.991
<i>Lawyers do not turn down
the Supreme Court.</i>

03:13.993 --> 03:16.226
<i>Dogs and cats remain
mortal enemies.</i>

03:16.228 --> 03:18.529
<i>Do you still have cats?</i>

03:18.531 --> 03:19.463
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

03:19.465 --> 03:21.098
<i>Th-they were all
Mariel's thing.</i>

03:21.100 --> 03:25.169
<i>When she took off with that douche bag,
the cats were part of the bargain.</i>

03:25.171 --> 03:29.606
<i>I don't trust
men who like cats.</i>

03:31.844 --> 03:36.980
<i>You and I-- we
go back a long way.</i>

03:36.982 --> 03:41.285
<i>We're both successful, we
run in the same circles.</i>

03:41.287 --> 03:45.756
<i>We understand each
other's lives.</i>

03:45.758 --> 03:48.325
<i>The one thing that I managed to
keep out of Mariel's grubby</i>

03:48.327 --> 03:50.360
<i>mitts was the place
down in Palm Beach.</i>

03:50.362 --> 03:51.829
<i>Now, I was going to head down</i>

03:51.831 --> 03:55.666
<i>there this weekend and...
I just</i>

03:55.668 --> 03:57.701
<i>thought maybe you could join me.</i>

04:00.472 --> 04:02.973
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

04:04.776 --> 04:08.812
<i>Just get out of this weather,
soak up some sun.</i>

04:22.627 --> 04:24.695

05:35.301 --> 05:37.501
<i>You didn't ask me.</i>

05:37.503 --> 05:40.971
<i>Right, I didn't ask.</i>

05:40.973 --> 05:44.708
<i>I have to ask, like always.</i>

05:44.710 --> 05:45.876
<i>So now I'm asking.</i>

05:45.878 --> 05:49.079
<i>What is going on?</i>

05:49.081 --> 05:51.682
<i>I left your father.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:56.186
<i>I thought that might be it.</i>

05:56.188 --> 05:57.788
<i>When did this happen?</i>

05:57.790 --> 05:59.056
<i>A few weeks ago.</i>

05:59.058 --> 06:00.958
<i>But I spoke to you since then.</i>

06:00.960 --> 06:01.959
<i>You didn't say anything.</i>

06:01.961 --> 06:02.926
<i>You were telling me</i>

06:02.928 --> 06:04.728
<i>about work, and I didn't
want to bother you.</i>

06:04.730 --> 06:06.897
<i>Oh, Jesus, Mom.</i>

06:06.899 --> 06:08.865
<i>Where have you been staying?</i>

06:08.867 --> 06:12.402
<i>With Judy Manginelli, but
then her nephews came to visit.</i>

06:12.404 --> 06:14.738
<i>What happened with Dad?</i>

06:14.740 --> 06:19.743
<i>I couldn't take it
anymore-- the yelling, the screaming.</i>

06:19.745 --> 06:21.845
<i>All I try to do is please him.</i>

06:21.847 --> 06:25.449
<i>I can't do anything right.</i>

06:25.451 --> 06:27.851
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

06:27.853 --> 06:29.319
<i>I know how he can be.</i>

06:29.321 --> 06:34.124
<i>No, it's gotten worse.</i>

06:34.126 --> 06:37.794
<i>What do you mean?</i>

06:37.796 --> 06:41.031
<i>Did he hit you?</i>

06:41.033 --> 06:42.432
<i>Mom.</i>

06:42.434 --> 06:46.937
<i>No, but he, he threw something.</i>

06:46.939 --> 06:48.005
<i>What?</i>

06:48.007 --> 06:49.406
<i>You know that crystal</i>

06:49.408 --> 06:51.808
<i>bunny, the one Gran gave Carrie?</i>

06:51.810 --> 06:53.243
<i>Oh, my God, Mom.</i>

06:53.245 --> 06:55.412
<i>It missed.</i>

06:55.414 --> 06:58.282
<i>It didn't hit me,
but I was scared.</i>

06:58.284 --> 06:59.416
<i>I mean, it was nothing.</i>

06:59.418 --> 07:01.084
<i>I should just go back home.</i>

07:01.086 --> 07:02.219
<i>I should just go back.</i>

07:02.221 --> 07:03.053
<i>Mom, no.</i>

07:03.055 --> 07:05.055
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

07:05.057 --> 07:06.590
<i>I can't stay with you forever,</i>

07:06.592 --> 07:11.428
<i>Carrie has the baby, and money--
I mean, I have no money.</i>

07:11.430 --> 07:14.665
<i>Don't worry about money.</i>

07:14.667 --> 07:17.301
<i>We'll find a place for you.</i>

07:17.303 --> 07:20.637
<i>We'll figure this out.</i>

07:20.639 --> 07:23.473
<i>But do not go back home.</i>

07:25.643 --> 07:27.611
<i>Promise me.</i>

07:27.613 --> 07:28.612
<i>Promise me.</i>

07:28.614 --> 07:30.213
<i>Okay.</i>

07:30.215 --> 07:32.949
<i>I promise.</i>

08:34.010 --> 08:36.480
<i>Look at this.</i>

08:36.482 --> 08:38.414
<i>Hello, McClaren, what
took you so long?</i>

08:56.401 --> 08:59.035
<i>I'm watching you, asshole.</i>

09:04.442 --> 09:06.943
<i>Are you stealing his info?</i>

09:06.945 --> 09:08.145
<i>Shh-shh-shh.</i>

09:10.782 --> 09:13.650
<i>Come on, you can
do better than that.</i>

09:37.842 --> 09:39.810
<i>Wait a second.</i>

09:42.481 --> 09:43.480
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

09:43.482 --> 09:44.748
<i>He found a gap.</i>

09:53.524 --> 09:55.492
<i>Fucker is good.</i>

10:05.603 --> 10:07.604
<i>Got it.</i>

10:14.645 --> 10:16.188
<i>What the fuck?</i>

10:33.297 --> 10:36.066
<i>Almost done.</i>

10:39.337 --> 10:41.304
<i>What?</i>

10:41.306 --> 10:45.075
<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

10:45.676 --> 10:47.511
<i>Fuck!</i>

10:49.715 --> 10:51.214
<i>It's okay, hm?</i>

10:51.216 --> 10:55.485
<i>Come back to bed?</i>

10:55.487 --> 10:57.554
<i>Okay?</i>

11:04.495 --> 11:08.164
<i>So, what do we
got here, Mr. Stahl?</i>

11:08.166 --> 11:10.033
<i>I see that almost two decades
ago, you dropped out of MIT.</i>

11:10.035 --> 11:11.101
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:11.103 --> 11:14.771
<i>And you've only been an
attorney for the last five years.</i>

11:14.773 --> 11:16.373
<i>That's right.</i>

11:16.375 --> 11:18.241
<i>Late bloomer, huh?</i>

11:18.243 --> 11:19.543
<i>You could say that.</i>

11:19.545 --> 11:21.244
<i>Huh.</i>

11:21.246 --> 11:23.680
<i>So, what were you
doing all that time?</i>

11:23.682 --> 11:26.449
<i>Tinkering with computers.</i>

11:26.451 --> 11:28.718
<i>Tinkering?</i>

11:28.720 --> 11:30.554
<i>You're 45 years old.</i>

11:30.556 --> 11:33.490
<i>I have a thing for technology.</i>

11:33.492 --> 11:35.692
<i>So, why the law?</i>

11:35.694 --> 11:38.495
<i>Uh, friends of mine were
pushing the boundaries hacking.</i>

11:38.497 --> 11:40.030
<i>When they got in legal trouble,</i>

11:40.032 --> 11:42.832
<i>I volunteered to assist
with their defense.</i>

11:42.834 --> 11:44.668
<i>I got interested in cyber-law.</i>

11:44.670 --> 11:46.970
<i>What do you think
of Channing McClaren?</i>

11:46.972 --> 11:48.538
<i>He was a hero of mine.</i>

11:48.540 --> 11:50.941
<i>You are aware that
we're suing him, right?</i>

11:50.943 --> 11:53.910
<i>I said he was</i> a hero,

11:53.912 --> 11:57.747
back in the days when I thought
all institutions were corrupt

11:57.749 --> 12:00.116
and worthy of attack.

12:00.118 --> 12:03.086
Now I believe in privacy.

12:03.088 --> 12:05.655
People have a right to
keep their secrets.

12:05.657 --> 12:08.658
I don't think the world would
function on full disclosure.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.793
Yeah, very noble.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.095
And for this reason
we should hire you?

12:12.097 --> 12:14.898
I-I think
you already have.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.732
Huh?

12:15.734 --> 12:18.001
I said I think
you already have.

12:18.003 --> 12:21.471
Oh, I see.

12:21.473 --> 12:23.006
I guess I'm out of the loop.

12:23.008 --> 12:27.611
So, Jake, I assume you're
up to speed with our suit.

12:27.613 --> 12:28.778
I read all the briefs.

12:28.780 --> 12:30.614
Let me ask you...

12:30.616 --> 12:33.817
Suppose Naomi Walling refused
to leak what she knew.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.619
Okay.

12:35.621 --> 12:39.255
How would McClaren have gotten
the insider trading information?

12:39.257 --> 12:42.826
The easiest way would be to
steal it from the Princefield system.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.261
A guy like McClaren would
have no problem hacking in.

12:45.263 --> 12:50.500
And if he did that, could he
also access Naomi's personal e-mails?

12:50.502 --> 12:55.538
Sure, as long as she was
on the Princefield network.

12:55.540 --> 12:58.541
Which, being an employee,
I imagine she was.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.677
How difficult is that to prove?

13:00.679 --> 13:03.546
I just need access
to the company's servers.

13:03.548 --> 13:05.548
I can find out if they've
been tampered with.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.550
Well, I'm afraid
we got a problem there.

13:07.552 --> 13:11.221
The SEC has seized everything
for their own investigation.

13:11.223 --> 13:14.457
Well, it sounds like
you need to talk to the SEC.

13:17.261 --> 13:21.164
I got inside,
but he slammed the door.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.333
Who is this guy exactly?

13:23.335 --> 13:26.102
He calls himself Samurai Seven.

13:26.104 --> 13:28.204
I met him online when I
was still in high school.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.273
How do you know
he's not bluffing?

13:30.275 --> 13:33.777
You believe he has more
information on Princefield?

13:33.779 --> 13:36.079
He's a prick,
but he's very good.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.081
If he says he's got
it, he's got it.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.984
Well, if he does have
more information, maybe

13:40.986 --> 13:44.154
Naomi Walling wasn't
the leak after all.

13:45.623 --> 13:49.059
Fuck it, Channing, just
pay the guy some money.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.193
Let's find out what he has.

13:50.195 --> 13:53.196
If anyone found out I
bought stolen goods, it would

13:53.198 --> 13:54.497
taint everything I've done.

13:54.499 --> 13:56.900
We need to know if
there's anything in this

13:56.902 --> 13:58.935
information which could
hurt you in the lawsuit.

13:58.937 --> 14:03.506
You know where I stand.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.575
I'm not paying.

14:12.183 --> 14:16.052
We're gonna have to pay
for the information ourselves.

14:16.054 --> 14:17.153
You heard him.

14:17.155 --> 14:18.488
He said no.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.558
Oh, Gitta...
if you really want to help

14:21.560 --> 14:24.060
Channing, you're gonna have to
learn not to listen to all

14:24.062 --> 14:26.563
his wishes all the time.

14:26.565 --> 14:32.035
Channing doesn't know
how to protect himself.

14:38.776 --> 14:40.610
Okay.

14:40.612 --> 14:42.412
If you think we
have to, buy it.

14:42.414 --> 14:45.148
Well, the problem is I
need Channing's signature to

14:45.150 --> 14:46.116
release the funds.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.151
Well, if it's just
a question of money,

14:48.153 --> 14:49.219
there's always a way.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.254
Said the poor little rich girl.

14:52.257 --> 14:55.325
Maybe you could just ask
your father for the money.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.326
Right.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.528
See if he'll give you
the keys to the trust fund?

14:58.530 --> 15:01.231
Yeah, he's not gonna
give me any money until I'm

15:01.233 --> 15:05.769
married, and I'm never
gonna get married.

15:05.771 --> 15:09.539
Anyway, this Samurai guy
hasn't even given us a price.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.708
I suppose the first thing we
have to do is find out how

15:11.710 --> 15:14.611
much he actually wants.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.746
Do you know how to
get in touch with him?

15:16.748 --> 15:18.715
I could find out.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.251
You want access
to the Princefield servers?

15:21.253 --> 15:24.120
They could be
crucial to my lawsuit.

15:24.122 --> 15:26.189
Well, it's not the
SEC's job to try your case.

15:26.191 --> 15:29.125
The servers have already been
impounded for our investigation.

15:29.127 --> 15:30.660
I can subpoena them.

15:30.662 --> 15:31.761
Well, go ahead.

15:31.763 --> 15:33.296
You still have to wait in line.

15:33.298 --> 15:35.899
We get first crack,
and you know it.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.735
I was hoping for
a little cooperation.

15:38.737 --> 15:41.805
I'm not about to let
my agency get drawn into a

15:41.807 --> 15:43.840
civil suit against
Channing McClaren.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.475
You're gonna have to wait.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.509
How long?

15:46.511 --> 15:48.945
Ah, 12, 14 months, best guess.

15:48.947 --> 15:49.946
That's unacceptable.

15:49.948 --> 15:54.851
Well, look, maybe
I can get you the back-up tapes.

15:54.853 --> 15:55.852
That won't work.

15:55.854 --> 16:00.390
My technical advisor needs the
hardware to conduct his analysis.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.758
Analysis for what?

16:01.760 --> 16:05.228
To determine if Naomi
Walling actually leaked the

16:05.230 --> 16:07.831
information or if it was
stolen by an outside source.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.999
I don't care about the leak.

16:10.001 --> 16:12.936
My job is to clean
up insider trading.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.505
Your job is to
issue parking tickets.

16:15.507 --> 16:19.876
Princefield has already
paid over $15 million in fines.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.578
Congratulations.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.013
Did they find that in
their sofa cushions?

16:24.015 --> 16:25.048
They're a $40billion company.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.050
Our investigation is ongoing.

16:27.052 --> 16:31.821
My client's
mother killed herself.

16:31.823 --> 16:34.390
How do you think the public
will feel when they find out

16:34.392 --> 16:40.830
that you're standing in the way of
her getting some measure of justice.

16:40.832 --> 16:44.667
I'm not going to be
intimidated by you, Ms. Hewes.

16:44.669 --> 16:46.736
I'm sorry.

16:56.213 --> 16:58.248
How old are you?

17:00.384 --> 17:02.986
I assume that means
you're the guy I'm waiting for.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.220
I am.

17:04.222 --> 17:07.290
Is there something other
than Samurai I can call you?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.724
It makes me feel a bit stupid.

17:08.727 --> 17:09.893
Why's that?

17:09.895 --> 17:14.230
Well, because
it's a bit stupid.

17:14.232 --> 17:15.397
How old are you?

17:15.400 --> 17:16.833
Why does that matter?

17:16.835 --> 17:20.036
Who the fuck
is Channing McClaren?

17:20.038 --> 17:23.138
Some computer geek who started
spilling secrets for attention?

17:23.141 --> 17:25.708
Now he's sleeping with you.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.844
I just work for him.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.548
Don't get me wrong,
I think you're smart.

17:32.550 --> 17:33.650
I've seen the
online interviews.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.785
You appear to have a brain.

17:35.787 --> 17:39.455
Look, I know Channing
turned down your offer, but

17:39.457 --> 17:41.491
we think he's making a mistake.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.159
We?

17:43.161 --> 17:46.362
The organization.

17:46.364 --> 17:48.431
Channing doesn't
know you're here, does he?

17:48.433 --> 17:49.465
No.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.601
And I'm not saying we're
ready to make a deal.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.903
But before we can decide, we
need to know how much the

17:53.905 --> 17:54.904
information's going to cost.

17:54.906 --> 17:56.940
Where are you
going to get the cash?

17:56.942 --> 17:59.342
Well, that's our
problem, isn't it?

17:59.344 --> 18:00.343
Just give me a price.

18:00.345 --> 18:04.280
You want a number?

18:04.282 --> 18:06.582
There it is.

18:15.326 --> 18:16.592
Hey. Any luck?

18:16.594 --> 18:19.429
Nope, they won't
give us the servers.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.830
Government pricks.

18:20.832 --> 18:22.465
So what are you
going to do now?

18:22.467 --> 18:23.733
Attack.

18:23.735 --> 18:28.471
I'm gonna take
this case public.

18:28.473 --> 18:32.375
Naomi Walling was a long-term
employee of Princefield Bank.

18:32.377 --> 18:38.247
She was a brave, principled
woman who found herself

18:38.249 --> 18:40.550
entangled in an insider
trading scandal.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.018
But she did the right thing.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.221
She went to Channing McClaren
intending to be a whistle-blower.

18:45.223 --> 18:47.390
Ms. Walling's
personal e-mails detailing

18:47.392 --> 18:52.528
affairs she had with Wall Street
executives were included in the leak.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.030
Yes. Correct.

18:54.032 --> 18:58.901
She was humiliated publicly,
as a result of which, she

18:58.903 --> 19:00.403
tragically took her own life.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.739
Well, McClaren
contends that she mistakenly

19:02.741 --> 19:08.511
sent those files, and by some oversight,
they ended up on his web-site.

19:08.513 --> 19:09.512
Which is nonsense.

19:09.514 --> 19:13.549
So, the basis of
your lawsuit is that McClaren

19:13.551 --> 19:17.487
intentionally sought to harm
her with those e-mails.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.688
Yes.

19:18.690 --> 19:23.192
Mr. McClaren has stated publicly
that he did not know Ms. Walling

19:23.194 --> 19:25.361
personally, that they never met.

19:25.363 --> 19:27.230
This is a lie.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.264
They met twice.

19:28.266 --> 19:29.265
Twice?

19:29.267 --> 19:30.266
Mm-hmm.

19:30.268 --> 19:32.335
On the second occasion, Ms.
Walling changed her mind.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.537
She decided not to leak.

19:34.539 --> 19:36.606
But when she informed Mr. McClaren

19:36.608 --> 19:40.443
of her decision, he
berated her, he threatened her,

19:40.445 --> 19:44.647
and when she still wouldn't
acquiesce to his demands, he

19:44.649 --> 19:47.450
sexually assaulted her.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.751
Jesus Christ.

19:48.753 --> 19:51.821
This is a man who clearly
had the power to ruin her life.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.891
I hate to stop it there,
but I have to take a break.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.959
We'll be back with Patty Hewes.

20:01.165 --> 20:03.733
Patty has nothing,
so she's going to the press.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.802
Call Judge Gearheart.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.003
I want to schedule a hearing.

20:11.042 --> 20:15.845
Parsons & Associates.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.514
It's Channing McClaren.

20:18.516 --> 20:21.317
See, I don't
understand how Patty Hewes can

20:21.319 --> 20:24.287
go on television and sling
unfounded accusations.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.223
I've scheduled a hearing with
the judge to address her actions.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.891
In the meantime, I've
spent all morning fending off

20:28.893 --> 20:30.860
calls from the press
wanting a response.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.929
I'll be drafting a
statement this afternoon.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.964
Well, I want to see
it before it goes out.

20:34.966 --> 20:36.332
Of course.

20:36.334 --> 20:39.001
Since I have you here, Channing,
I need your help with something.

20:39.003 --> 20:45.208
Patty Hewes is attempting to gain
access to the Princefield servers.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.310
Was she able to get them?

20:47.312 --> 20:48.578
No.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.947
The SEC has jurisdiction
over them right now.

20:50.949 --> 20:54.650
But what do you think Patty
would be looking for?

20:54.652 --> 20:59.522
My guess is she's
trying to find out if someone

20:59.524 --> 21:02.725
other than Naomi Walling leaked
the Princefield information.

21:02.727 --> 21:05.795
I don't understand.

21:05.797 --> 21:09.966
When I receive information,
it's masked by an encryption code.

21:09.968 --> 21:15.638
This protects the source from
being identified... even by me.

21:15.640 --> 21:20.877
So, you can't be certain that
Naomi Walling sent you the information?

21:20.879 --> 21:24.947
No, I can't.

21:24.949 --> 21:28.718
And why haven't
you mentioned this before?

21:28.720 --> 21:32.155
Well, we knew that Ms. Walling was
considering leaking.

21:32.157 --> 21:38.327
When we received the information,
naturally we assumed it was from her.

21:38.329 --> 21:40.730
But if I'm
understanding this correctly,

21:40.732 --> 21:43.933
now you are saying that it is
possible that someone broke into

21:43.935 --> 21:46.969
the Princefield servers and
accessed Naomi's information

21:46.971 --> 21:49.205
through the company network?

21:49.207 --> 21:50.540
Yes.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.609
There are many people with the
technical skill to do that.

21:53.611 --> 21:56.779
Do you have the technical
skill to do that, Mr. McClaren?

21:56.781 --> 22:00.983
Yes, I do.

22:00.985 --> 22:03.085
Why are you asking him that?

22:03.087 --> 22:05.521
She's right to ask him.

22:05.523 --> 22:09.559
Because Patty Hewes is gonna ask
you exactly the same question.

22:09.561 --> 22:13.062
Did you steal the information?

22:13.064 --> 22:15.064
Of course not.

22:15.066 --> 22:20.336
Do you still
believe Naomi leaked?

22:20.338 --> 22:23.072
I don't know.

22:23.074 --> 22:29.111
Do you think someone
took the information from her?

22:29.113 --> 22:33.149
I really don't know.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.189
Was today a fun day?

22:40.191 --> 22:41.924
Yes.

22:41.926 --> 22:46.662
Did you finish your drawing?

22:46.664 --> 22:50.466
Can I have a sword?

22:50.468 --> 22:51.567
A sword?

22:51.569 --> 22:54.570
Hm, wouldn't you rather
have a new doll?

22:54.572 --> 22:57.506
I want a
sword like the man had.

22:57.508 --> 23:00.276
What man?

23:00.278 --> 23:02.878
The man with the sword.

23:02.880 --> 23:09.652
Honey, where did you
see a man with a sword?

23:09.654 --> 23:12.655
Can I have a snack?

23:12.657 --> 23:13.889
Sure.

23:13.891 --> 23:16.425
As soon as we get home.

23:16.427 --> 23:17.860
I want cheese.

23:17.862 --> 23:19.996
Okay, you can have some cheese.

23:19.998 --> 23:23.199
Ms. Hewes should be sanctioned
and barred from speaking to the press.

23:23.201 --> 23:25.268
Yes, I read your motion.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.336
Her television
appearance was a calculated and

23:27.338 --> 23:30.006
unfounded attack on my
client's reputation.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.441
I was simply
answering questions.

23:32.443 --> 23:33.442
It was a wide-ranging
interview.

23:33.444 --> 23:36.178
You called my client a rapist.

23:36.180 --> 23:39.815
Frankly, I'm not sure Ms. Hewes
accusations don't qualify as slander.

23:39.817 --> 23:41.917
I stand by what I said.

23:41.919 --> 23:48.891
If you think I defamed your client, then
go ahead and file a suit against me.

23:48.893 --> 23:51.560
She won't, Your Honor, because
it's not slander if it's true.

23:51.562 --> 23:56.265
And Ms. Parsons cannot disprove
that a sexual assault took place.

23:56.267 --> 23:58.367
Any more than Ms. Hewes
can prove that it did.

23:58.369 --> 24:01.604
All right, look, I don't
want this thing tried in the press.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.738
I'm issuing a gag order.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.244
There will be no
discussion of this case

24:05.355 --> 24:08.355
over the airwaves,
in print, online, anywhere.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.646
That holds for both of you.

24:10.648 --> 24:11.781
Got it?

24:11.783 --> 24:13.416
Both of us?

24:13.418 --> 24:16.319
I deserve an opportunity to
respond to these accusations.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.387
You have a forum to respond.

24:18.389 --> 24:19.388
It's called a trial.

24:19.390 --> 24:23.492
In the meantime, neither of
you speaks to the media.

24:30.534 --> 24:35.171
Your Honor, this is the
ruling that Ms. Hewes was hoping for.

24:35.173 --> 24:36.272
I should have realized.

24:36.274 --> 24:43.646
She provoked this gag order so I
couldn't give my account in the press.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.348
She's using you to silence me.

24:45.350 --> 24:48.284
I resent that.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.518
So do I.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.587
The gag order stands.

25:08.205 --> 25:12.208
The deposition went very well.

25:12.210 --> 25:13.976
Yes?

25:13.978 --> 25:18.681
Miss Parsons got the
witness to lie on record, so,

25:18.683 --> 25:21.317
perhaps we'll keep her as
our attorney after all.

25:21.319 --> 25:25.855
If you think that's best.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.957
What now?

25:27.959 --> 25:30.993
There's something else.

25:30.995 --> 25:33.396
Someone's approached
Channing offering to sell new

25:33.398 --> 25:36.732
information regarding
Princefield and Naomi Walling.

25:36.734 --> 25:39.802
And who is this person?

25:39.804 --> 25:42.838
Someone well-known
in the hacking community.

25:42.840 --> 25:47.109
A hacker with more information
about Princefield.

25:47.111 --> 25:49.945
You have specifics?

25:49.947 --> 25:51.647
No.

25:51.649 --> 25:55.484
And obviously, we don't know how
this could impact on the case,

25:55.486 --> 25:59.889
but we have reason to
believe his claims.

25:59.891 --> 26:00.890
So, buy it.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.224
Use the funds I've given you.

26:02.226 --> 26:04.493
Channing won't
pay for information.

26:04.495 --> 26:05.494
Don't tell Channing.

26:05.496 --> 26:14.136
I can't access the organization's
resources without his approval.

26:14.138 --> 26:15.137
How much?

26:15.139 --> 26:17.373
I need half a million dollars.

26:17.375 --> 26:18.374
Ah.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.443
In for penny, in for a pound.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.711
There is a market
for this information.

26:22.713 --> 26:26.782
If we don't act now, we
could lose the opportunity.

26:26.784 --> 26:31.454
I will consider and
get back to you.

26:38.328 --> 26:41.363
Thank you.

26:55.812 --> 26:59.949
When can I get a real sword?

26:59.951 --> 27:02.017
What, honey?

27:02.019 --> 27:07.356
A sword, like the man.

27:07.358 --> 27:09.758
What man, sweetie?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.161
The man who was here.

27:12.163 --> 27:13.162
Here?

27:13.164 --> 27:16.232
The man was in the apartment?

27:25.275 --> 27:28.210
Yes, this is Catherine's nanny.

27:28.212 --> 27:31.213
I need to speak to Ms. Hewes.

27:31.215 --> 27:34.850
Well, would have her call
me as soon as she can?

27:34.852 --> 27:37.586
It's urgent.

27:37.588 --> 27:41.190
Oh, my God, your
daughter is adorable.

27:41.192 --> 27:42.191
What's her name?

27:42.193 --> 27:43.225
Catherine.

27:43.227 --> 27:44.860
And she lives with you?

27:44.862 --> 27:45.995
No.

27:45.997 --> 27:49.064
My mom used her connections
to prevent that.

27:49.066 --> 27:52.268
She's fighting tooth and nail
to keep Catherine away from me.

27:52.270 --> 27:53.602
Why?

27:53.604 --> 27:56.972
Because she's
petty and vindictive.

27:56.974 --> 28:00.175
Which is the same reason she
took the Channing McClaren case.

28:00.177 --> 28:02.545
I thought she's suing
Mr. McClaren for the wrongful

28:02.547 --> 28:03.746
death of a whistleblower.

28:04.749 --> 28:07.483
This case isn't about McClaren.

28:07.485 --> 28:08.884
Then what's it about?

28:08.886 --> 28:10.386
Ellen Parsons.

28:10.388 --> 28:13.022
See, my mother's
a megalomaniac.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.191
She can't bear the thought of
her former associate stepping

28:16.193 --> 28:19.028
out of her shadow
and eclipsing her.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.863
That's interesting.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.599
If-If you ask my
mother about her work, she'll

28:23.601 --> 28:27.069
tell you, she's a solo crusader
righteously slaying dragons.

28:27.071 --> 28:29.838
And the truth is...?

28:29.840 --> 28:32.908
She doesn't care about
justice or corporate bullies.

28:32.910 --> 28:36.579
She's a paranoid narcissist who
manipulates the law to gain

28:36.581 --> 28:39.114
power and settle scores.

28:39.116 --> 28:42.251
You sure you're
okay having me quote you?

28:43.321 --> 28:44.320
Absolutely.

28:45.523 --> 28:47.489
Go ahead and change the tape.

28:47.491 --> 28:50.960
I've got plenty
more to tell you.

29:02.973 --> 29:08.243
Catherine, can you tell
me about the man with the sword?

29:08.245 --> 29:11.981
Did you see him here?

29:11.983 --> 29:15.651
In the apartment?

29:15.653 --> 29:17.486
Where exactly?

29:17.488 --> 29:20.556
He lives in the garbage can.

29:20.558 --> 29:24.593
What do you mean, he lives
in the garbage can, sweetheart?

29:24.595 --> 29:26.562
Don't mad.

29:26.564 --> 29:28.664
Why would I be mad?

29:28.666 --> 29:31.100
I wasn't supposed to touch it.

29:31.102 --> 29:33.802
Touch what?

29:33.804 --> 29:36.872
My computer?

29:40.977 --> 29:44.380
<i>Inside</i> the garbage can?

29:54.624 --> 29:56.592
Where is it?
Show it to me.

29:56.594 --> 29:57.593
Come on in.

29:57.595 --> 29:59.928
How long has it been there?

29:59.930 --> 30:01.964
I have no idea.

30:03.166 --> 30:05.267
Fucking incredible.

30:05.269 --> 30:06.535
It's Samurai Seven.

30:06.537 --> 30:07.536
What's that?

30:07.538 --> 30:08.537
A virus?

30:08.539 --> 30:09.538
No. A person.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.707
He's notorious in the
hacker community.

30:11.709 --> 30:14.910
He's broken into all kinds of tight networks...
Fortune 500 companies and

30:14.912 --> 30:16.345
government agencies.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.480
- Oh, that's...
- What are you doing?

30:18.482 --> 30:19.481
No, it's okay.

30:19.483 --> 30:22.718
Everything on your system
has been backed up.

30:37.434 --> 30:40.302
Well, how do
you want to respond?

30:45.756 --> 30:47.309
What kind?

31:06.062 --> 31:08.097
What do you think?

31:08.099 --> 31:11.667
Well, like I said, he's legit,
but he's also a bit of an asshole.

31:11.669 --> 31:14.737
I mean, it-it could be a prank.

31:40.496 --> 31:41.797
Looks promising.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.866
Mm-hmm.

31:49.806 --> 31:52.741
I need to think about it.

31:57.948 --> 31:59.314
What is it?

32:00.317 --> 32:01.950
Computer's frozen.

32:01.952 --> 32:03.886
It covers his tracks.

32:03.888 --> 32:06.088
He's gone.

32:12.295 --> 32:14.797
So, who exactly
made this decision?

32:14.799 --> 32:18.133
What difference does it make?

32:18.135 --> 32:20.135
I cannot get you these monies.

32:20.137 --> 32:23.305
Patty Hewes may be attempting
to obtain this information.

32:23.307 --> 32:24.740
We have to assume
it can hurt us.

32:24.742 --> 32:26.775
Assume what you will.

32:26.777 --> 32:30.913
I-I don't understand why
this isn't of more concern to you.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.915
Good night.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.193
Hello?

32:44.195 --> 32:45.994
Gitta, it's me.

32:45.996 --> 32:48.197
Any luck?

32:48.199 --> 32:50.833
He said no.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.835
The hacker contacted me.

32:52.837 --> 32:56.205
He said we have 48 hours to
get the money, or no deal.

32:56.207 --> 32:58.340
What now?

32:58.342 --> 33:01.410
Call Ellen Parsons.

33:03.446 --> 33:05.547
So, what is the
information exactly?

33:05.549 --> 33:08.550
It involves Naomi
Walling and Princefield.

33:08.552 --> 33:09.551
That's all we know.

33:09.553 --> 33:11.553
And this hacker
wants to sell it?

33:11.555 --> 33:12.688
Yes.

33:12.690 --> 33:17.092
The problem is, Channing refuses to
pay for information on principle.

33:17.094 --> 33:18.327
And he can be very stubborn.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.329
So, Channing
doesn't know you're here?

33:20.331 --> 33:21.330
No.

33:21.332 --> 33:26.368
Rutger and I thought
we needed to act.

33:26.370 --> 33:28.904
Unfortunately, we
can't get the cash.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.406
But we were hoping you could.

33:31.408 --> 33:33.008
How much?

33:33.010 --> 33:36.011
$500,000.

33:36.013 --> 33:39.047
That's a tall
order on short notice.

33:39.049 --> 33:44.653
Think of it as an
investment in the case.

33:44.655 --> 33:48.190
You said this hacker
and Channing know each other?

33:48.192 --> 33:50.626
They were friends once.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.228
Is there a chance this
guy hacked Naomi Walling on

33:53.230 --> 33:54.296
Channing's behalf?

33:54.298 --> 33:55.397
No.

33:55.399 --> 33:57.466
Absolutely not.

33:59.903 --> 34:03.839
Miss Parsons, if you keep
feeling the need to question

34:03.841 --> 34:06.141
Channing's innocence, why
are you representing him?

34:06.143 --> 34:08.476
It's not personal.

34:08.478 --> 34:11.612
I'm a lawyer, and I can't afford
to trust anybody, least of all

34:11.614 --> 34:13.181
my clients.

34:13.183 --> 34:16.685
And Channing has
already lied to me.

34:16.687 --> 34:20.022
Well, Patty Hewes has the
money to buy this information.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.023
Am I right?

34:21.025 --> 34:22.024
Yes.

34:22.025 --> 34:24.592
So, if he's looking to
sell to the highest bidder,

34:24.594 --> 34:27.963
don't we have to assume
that he's approached her?

34:29.933 --> 34:32.367
Do you know how to
make contact with this guy?

34:32.369 --> 34:35.771
I can get his information.

34:37.340 --> 34:40.375
Does that mean we're buyers?

34:51.387 --> 34:53.722
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.724
I was just about to come to you.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.960
I've decided to make
a deal for the information.

34:57.962 --> 34:59.962
What's the delivery method?

34:59.964 --> 35:02.230
Insist on a flash drive.

35:02.232 --> 35:03.699
Simpler, safer.

35:03.701 --> 35:07.536
And don't open it until I run forensics,
make sure there's not a Trojan horse.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.538
Otherwise, you could corrupt
your whole network.

35:09.540 --> 35:13.575
Is there any way to ensure
that I'm getting the only copy?

35:13.577 --> 35:14.576
Mm, no.

35:14.578 --> 35:17.012
I mean, I'm afraid it's
the age we live in.

35:17.014 --> 35:18.146
On paper, you can destroy.

35:18.148 --> 35:19.147
Digital bits, you can't.

35:19.149 --> 35:21.149
There's always a
record somewhere.

35:21.151 --> 35:24.453
I have to assume he's
approached the McClaren camp, as well.

35:24.455 --> 35:25.587
Absolutely.

35:25.589 --> 35:28.023
Last person you want
to trust is a hacker.

35:28.025 --> 35:32.361
Something you should
know about me, Jake.

35:32.363 --> 35:35.464
I don't trust anyone.

35:38.368 --> 35:43.238
So, um, somebody told me this
was, uh, Ellen Parsons' old office.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.607
Yes.

35:45.609 --> 35:47.242
That okay with you?

35:47.244 --> 35:48.243
Yeah.

35:48.245 --> 35:53.482
It's a bit small, but
I like the pedigree.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.616
What do you mean?

35:54.618 --> 35:58.053
Oh, you know, Ellen's become
something of a legend in the legal world.

35:58.055 --> 36:00.322
Your shine rubbed off on her.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.557
Sometime, I'd like
to hear that story.

36:02.559 --> 36:04.092
There's no story.

36:04.094 --> 36:08.397
She worked here,
then she moved on.

36:10.500 --> 36:16.705
I trust that's the last time you'll
ask me about a former employee.

36:20.843 --> 36:22.844
Understood.

37:25.808 --> 37:31.279
I worked up a summary
of your finances, like you asked.

37:31.281 --> 37:35.050
The top number is what you
have in cash right now.

37:35.052 --> 37:39.121
Below that are your current investments,
including your retirement account.

37:39.123 --> 37:41.823
I forbid you from going
anywhere near those.

37:41.825 --> 37:43.125
Okay.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.493
Moving down.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.927
Those are your
monthly expenses.

37:45.929 --> 37:46.995
The mortgage on your apartment.

37:46.997 --> 37:47.996
The lease on the office.

37:47.998 --> 37:50.999
And what's the number
next to that, in parentheses?

37:51.001 --> 37:53.335
That's what you
spent on office renovations,

37:53.337 --> 37:54.703
including furnishings.

37:54.705 --> 37:58.740
Underneath that is your overhead,
including Kate Franklin's salary.

37:58.742 --> 38:00.308
Then there's family expenses.

38:00.310 --> 38:02.811
The mortgage you pay on
your sister's apartment.

38:02.813 --> 38:05.213
Preschool for your niece.

38:05.215 --> 38:07.616
And we have to add your mother.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.684
Do you know how
much she'll need?

38:09.686 --> 38:12.053
I'll have to
get her an apartment.

38:12.055 --> 38:13.655
I'm not sure what else.

38:13.657 --> 38:16.224
Okay.

38:16.226 --> 38:19.127
First number on the next page is
what you have coming in from the

38:19.129 --> 38:22.063
McClaren retainer.

38:22.065 --> 38:24.866
So you understand why it's hard
for me to recommend taking out a

38:24.868 --> 38:28.236
half-million-dollar loan, if
I can even get you the loan.

38:28.238 --> 38:29.371
What do you mean?

38:29.373 --> 38:33.175
Ellen, you're a
startup firm with one client.

38:33.177 --> 38:36.144
A bank might not want
to assume the risk.

38:36.146 --> 38:40.248
More importantly, <i>you</i>
shouldn't assume the risk.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.417
You're overextended.

38:42.419 --> 38:47.422
As your accountant, I have
to advise against it.

38:47.424 --> 38:52.527
First, see if you can get
the loan, and then I'll decide.

39:09.245 --> 39:10.212
Hello?

39:10.214 --> 39:11.947
Patty. Roger Kastle.

39:11.949 --> 39:13.148
Hello, Roger.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.282
How was your weekend?

39:14.284 --> 39:16.651
Lost.

39:16.653 --> 39:20.789
I did my best Ray Milland
impersonation and it didn't help.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.190
I'm so sorry.

39:22.192 --> 39:23.458
Aw, forget about it.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.927
Have you got your latest issue
of <i>American Lawyer?</i>

39:25.929 --> 39:26.928
<i>Probably.</i>

39:26.930 --> 39:27.929
<i>I haven't read it yet.</i>

39:27.931 --> 39:30.098
<i>Well, there's something
you'll want to see.</i>

39:30.100 --> 39:31.967
<i>Can you look for it?</i>

39:31.969 --> 39:34.369
<i>Uh, sure.</i>

39:37.173 --> 39:39.641
<i>Page 38.</i>

39:46.449 --> 39:50.785
<i>I take it from your silence
that you found the article.</i>

39:50.787 --> 39:53.922
<i>Our little misunderstanding
aside, I care about you, and</i>

39:53.924 --> 39:55.257
<i>this isn't good.</i>

39:55.259 --> 39:58.860
<i>I'm not concerned with
my son's petty attacks.</i>

39:58.862 --> 40:01.563
<i>Patty, there's something
that I didn't want to</i>

40:01.565 --> 40:02.731
<i>mention before, but our friends</i>

40:02.733 --> 40:05.000
<i>in the legal community
have been talking.</i>

40:05.002 --> 40:06.134
<i>About what?</i>

40:06.136 --> 40:08.436
<i>Well, they think this
McClaren case is about you</i>

40:08.438 --> 40:11.206
<i>settling a personal score,
punishing Ellen Parsons for</i>

40:11.208 --> 40:14.476
<i>leaving your firm, and this article
just confirms their suspicions.</i>

40:14.478 --> 40:15.644
<i>I've got to go, Roger.</i>

40:15.646 --> 40:18.146
<i>You don't want that
perception out there, Patty.</i>

40:18.148 --> 40:19.514
<i>Now, you made your
reputation by</i>

40:19.516 --> 40:22.017
<i>going after bullies, and now
you're trying to crush a gnat.</i>

40:22.019 --> 40:25.320
<i>So just...
be careful, all right?</i>

40:25.322 --> 40:28.590
<i>This lawsuit could
blow up in your face.</i>

40:33.129 --> 40:34.596
<i>Hey, it's Mark.</i>

40:34.598 --> 40:37.565
<i>I was</i> able to get you the loan.

40:37.567 --> 40:38.800
Thank you.

40:38.802 --> 40:44.039
But, Ellen... I still don't
recommend you spending this money.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.941
My case may
hang in the balance.

40:46.943 --> 40:49.544
Well, it's up to you.

40:49.546 --> 40:52.380
Let me know what
you want to do.

41:02.758 --> 41:05.694
Baby, where you going, huh?

41:05.696 --> 41:08.963
It's time to meet
Miss Patricia C. Hewes, Esquire.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.267
You got what you need?

41:12.269 --> 41:14.969
Mm-hmm. Right here.

41:14.971 --> 41:16.638
So, when you coming home?

41:16.640 --> 41:19.974
I'm meeting her at
9:00, I'll make the exchange,

41:19.976 --> 41:22.210
then head straight home.

41:22.212 --> 41:24.579
You're not gonna
show your face, no?

41:24.581 --> 41:25.613
Why not?

41:25.615 --> 41:27.048
She doesn't know my name.

41:27.050 --> 41:29.284
I'm just the Samurai to her.

41:29.286 --> 41:30.418
Hi-yah!

41:33.790 --> 41:37.659
Baby, this thing you're
doing, it's okay, yeah?

41:37.661 --> 41:38.660
It's okay?

41:38.662 --> 41:39.861
I'll be fine.

41:47.858 --> 41:49.270
What do you know?

41:49.272 --> 41:51.673
It's the other lawyer.

42:25.107 --> 42:27.308
Both gonna pay.

42:27.310 --> 42:29.477
How fuckin' stupid are they?

42:47.963 --> 42:49.431
Hello?

42:49.433 --> 42:51.533
Who's the guy?

42:51.535 --> 42:53.668
My associate.

42:53.670 --> 42:56.604
He's going to handle
the transfer.

42:56.606 --> 43:01.042
How do I know you've
got the information?

43:01.044 --> 43:03.711
Pay me and find out.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.855
Check your bank account.

43:20.896 --> 43:23.364
Downloading.

43:27.503 --> 43:29.537
You look taller in person.

43:31.574 --> 43:32.974
Okay.

43:32.976 --> 43:35.743
The money's in my account.

44:06.475 --> 44:08.877
Good luck with your case.

44:15.017 --> 44:18.186
I'll run forensics
on the way back.

44:36.639 --> 44:38.373
Yes!

44:48.684 --> 44:50.718
