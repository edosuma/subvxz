01:00.770 --> 01:01.895
Yes, Marlin.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.022
I see it. It's beautiful.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.816
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view,

01:06.901 --> 01:10.612
you didn't think you were going
to get the whole ocean, did you?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.573
Oh, yeah!

01:13.658 --> 01:17.744
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

01:17.828 --> 01:20.247
- My man delivered.
- It wasn't so easy.

01:20.331 --> 01:23.208
A lot of clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

01:23.292 --> 01:26.962
You better believe they did.
Every single one of them.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.298
You did good
and the neighbourhood is awesome.

01:40.726 --> 01:45.772
- So you do like it, don't you?
- No, no, I really do like it.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.817
But, Marlin, I know that
the Drop Off is desirable,

01:48.901 --> 01:50.819
great schools, amazing view,

01:50.903 --> 01:53.446
but do we really need so much space?

01:53.531 --> 01:56.032
Coral, honey,
these are our kids we're talking about.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.242
They deserve the best.

01:57.326 --> 02:01.621
Look. They'll wake up, poke their
little heads out and see a whale

02:02.039 --> 02:03.832
right by their bedroom window!

02:04.292 --> 02:07.502
- You're going to wake the kids.
- Oh, right. Right.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.465
Look.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.885
They're dreaming.

02:16.721 --> 02:20.307
- We still have to name them.
- All of them? Right now?

02:20.391 --> 02:23.560
All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.770
and this half Coral Jr.

02:25.855 --> 02:28.315
- Okay, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

02:28.399 --> 02:29.816
Nemo?

02:29.900 --> 02:33.695
We'll name one Nemo,
but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.698
In a couple of days,
we're going to be parents!

02:36.782 --> 02:37.907
Yeah.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.578
- What if they don't like me?
- Marlin...

02:41.912 --> 02:43.330
There's over 400 eggs.

02:43.414 --> 02:46.583
Odds are one of them
is bound to like you.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.920
What?

02:51.630 --> 02:54.341
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.

02:54.425 --> 02:55.633
Well, I remember.

02:55.718 --> 02:58.553
Excuse me, miss.
Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

02:58.637 --> 03:00.847
- Marlin.
- Look closer.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.142
- Get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.438
Where did everybody go?

03:15.363 --> 03:17.030
Coral, get inside the house.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.993
No, don't. They'll be fine.
Just get inside.

03:22.078 --> 03:23.745
You. Right now.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.749
No!

03:46.977 --> 03:48.019
Coral!

03:54.443 --> 03:55.610
Coral?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.322
Coral?

04:06.205 --> 04:07.497
Coral!

04:10.042 --> 04:11.376
Coral!

04:17.341 --> 04:18.466
Coral?

04:41.532 --> 04:43.616
There, there.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.660
It's okay. Daddy's here.

04:47.163 --> 04:48.872
Daddy's got you.

04:51.959 --> 04:56.129
I promise I will never let
anything happen to you,

04:56.213 --> 04:57.505
Nemo.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.921
First day of school! Wake up!
Come on. First day of school.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.217
I don't want to go to school.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.093
- Not you, Dad. Me.
- Okay.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.179
Get up! Time for school!

05:47.598 --> 05:50.767
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school.
- Oh, boy!

05:50.851 --> 05:51.976
Nemo!

05:52.061 --> 05:54.812
- First day of school!
- Don't move.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.399
You'll never get out of there yourself.
I'll do it.

05:58.484 --> 06:00.318
- You feel a break?
- No.

06:00.402 --> 06:03.571
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area.
Any rushing fluids?

06:03.656 --> 06:06.366
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?

06:06.450 --> 06:08.368
- Answer the question.
- Three.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.829
No! Something's wrong with you.
I have one, two...

06:11.914 --> 06:13.790
Three. That's all I have?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.875
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

06:15.960 --> 06:18.211
- Lucky.
- Let's see.

06:20.339 --> 06:23.132
Sure you want to go to school this year?

06:23.217 --> 06:26.928
- You can wait five or six years.
- Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.222
Forgot to brush.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.766
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.309
- Yes.
- Brush.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.895
- I'm done.
- You missed a spot.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.855
- Where?
- There.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.316
Right there. And here and here.

06:49.576 --> 06:54.539
We're excited. First day of school.
Here we go. We're ready to learn.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.833
What do we have to remember
about the ocean?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.419
- It's not safe.
- That's my boy.

06:59.503 --> 07:04.299
First, we check to see that the coast
is clear. We go out and back in.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.592
Then we go out and back in.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.595
Then one more time. Out and back in.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.348
- If you want to do it four times...
- Dad...

07:12.433 --> 07:14.350
All right. Come on, boy.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.689
Maybe while I'm at school,
I'll see a shark.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.400
- I doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.153
- No, and I don't plan to.
- How old are sea turtles?

07:25.237 --> 07:27.447
Sea turtles? I don't know.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.949
Sandy Plankton from next door said that

07:30.034 --> 07:34.203
sea turtles live to be
about 100 years old.

07:34.288 --> 07:38.833
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him,
after I'm done talking to the shark.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.960
Hold on. Wait to cross.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.589
Hold my fin. Hold my fin.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.925
You're not going to freak out
like you did at the petting zoo.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.553
That snail was about to charge.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.473
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.684
- Bye, Mom.
- I'll pick you up after school.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.481
Come on, you guys.
Stop it. Give it back.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.567
Come on. We'll try over there.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.571
Excuse me.
Is this where we meet his teacher?

08:08.655 --> 08:12.158
- Look who's out of the anemone.
- Yes, shocking, I know.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.618
- Marty?
- Marlin.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.660
- Bob.
- Ted.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.746
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.624
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.001
- Yeah.
- Good idea.

08:22.086 --> 08:26.297
That's a misconception. Clownfish are
no funnier than any other fish.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.841
- Come on, Clowny.
- Do something funny.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.177
All right. I know one joke.

08:32.388 --> 08:35.306
There's a mollusk. He walks up to...

08:35.390 --> 08:37.100
Well, he swims up.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.020
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.
He's in one place.

08:41.105 --> 08:42.522
And then the sea cucumber...

08:43.440 --> 08:46.818
I'm mixed up. There was
a mollusk and a sea cucumber.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.736
None of them were walking...

08:48.821 --> 08:51.948
Sheldon!
Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now!

08:52.866 --> 08:55.034
All right, you kids!

08:55.119 --> 08:57.161
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

08:57.246 --> 08:59.622
Can I go play, too? Can I?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.458
I would feel better if you go play
over on the sponge beds.

09:07.756 --> 09:08.923
That's where I would play.

09:10.759 --> 09:14.011
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

09:14.096 --> 09:17.557
- Hey, what did I do?
- Be nice. It's his first time at school.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.143
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.269
Dad...

09:21.353 --> 09:25.106
See this tentacle?
It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

09:25.190 --> 09:29.569
But you can't really tell.
Especially when I twirl them like this.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.654
I'm H2O intolerant.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.157
I'm obnoxious.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.161
Let's name the zones,
the zones, the zones

09:38.245 --> 09:40.955
Let's name the zones of the open sea

09:41.039 --> 09:42.373
Mr Ray!

09:42.458 --> 09:44.500
- Come on, Nemo.
- Stay with me.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.420
There's epipelagic, mesopelagic,
bathyal, abyssopelagic

09:47.504 --> 09:51.007
All the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

09:51.091 --> 09:53.759
I wonder where my class has gone.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.636
We're under here.

09:55.721 --> 09:59.432
There you are! Come aboard, explorers.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.059
Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical

10:02.144 --> 10:04.604
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

10:04.688 --> 10:05.938
Dad, you can go now.

10:06.023 --> 10:08.983
- Well, hello. Who is this?
- I'm Nemo.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.612
Nemo, all new explorers
must answer a science question.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.615
- Okay.
- You live in what kind of home?

10:15.699 --> 10:19.869
In an anemoninny.
Anemonemenemone.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.330
Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.457
Just so you know, he's got a little fin.

10:24.541 --> 10:28.044
If he's having trouble swimming,
let him take a break. 15 minutes.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.296
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.465
We're going to stay together.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.176
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.639
Remember, we keep our
supraesophageal ganglion to ourselves.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.433
- That means you, Jimmy.
- Oh, man!

10:43.685 --> 10:45.895
- Bye, Nemo.
- Bye, Dad.

10:46.563 --> 10:47.647
Bye, son.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.984
Be safe.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.487
You're doing well for a first-timer.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.822
You can't hold on to them forever,
can you?

10:56.907 --> 11:00.117
I had a tough time when
my eldest went out on the Drop Off.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.745
The Drop Off!
They're going to the Drop Off?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.455
Are you insane?

11:04.540 --> 11:07.416
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

11:07.501 --> 11:09.126
Hey, Marty, calm down.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.003
Don't tell me to be calm, pony-boy.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.756
Pony-boy?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.467
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

11:16.552 --> 11:17.552
Pity.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.181
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

11:22.266 --> 11:25.101
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

11:31.024 --> 11:33.859
Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma, chordata

11:33.944 --> 11:35.194
And some fish like you and me!

11:35.279 --> 11:37.196
Come on. Sing with me.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.874
Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun

11:48.959 --> 11:50.960
It makes its food
from the rays of the sun

11:53.672 --> 11:55.756
Okay, the Drop Off.

11:55.841 --> 11:59.135
All right, kids.
Feel free to explore, but stay close.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.887
Stromatolitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

12:01.972 --> 12:05.182
An ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimal speck.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.312
Come on. Let's go.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.272
Come on. Sing with me.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.358
There's porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

12:14.443 --> 12:15.985
Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas three

12:16.862 --> 12:18.779
Hey, guys, wait up.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.157
Whoa!

12:24.745 --> 12:26.329
Cool.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.124
Saved your life!

12:30.834 --> 12:32.752
You guys made me ink.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.920
What's that?

12:36.757 --> 12:39.342
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

12:40.302 --> 12:42.553
He said it was called a butt.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.307
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.354
Look at me.
I'm going to go touch the butt.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.317
Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.693
Okay.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.529
Beat that.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.115
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

13:04.368 --> 13:07.495
- My dad says it's not safe.
- Nemo, no!

13:07.579 --> 13:08.704
Dad?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.414
You were about to
swim into open water.

13:10.499 --> 13:11.499
No!

13:11.583 --> 13:13.376
Good thing I was here.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.878
- He wasn't going to go.
- He was too afraid.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.506
- I wasn't.
- This does not concern you.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.051
You're lucky I don't tell your parents.
You can't swim well.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.346
- I can swim fine, Dad, okay?
- No. It's not okay.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.889
You shouldn't be near here.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.558
You'll start school in a year or two.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.728
No. Just because
you're scared of the ocean...

13:32.813 --> 13:34.730
Clearly you're not ready.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.775
You think you can do these things,
but you just can't!

13:39.361 --> 13:40.736
I hate you.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.949
There's...

13:45.033 --> 13:46.826
Nothing to see. Gather there.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.204
Anything I can do?
I am a scientist. Is there any problem?

13:50.288 --> 13:53.457
I didn't mean to interrupt.
He isn't a good swimmer.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.711
I think it's too soon
for him to be out here unsupervised.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.004
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.256
I'm sure he is.

14:00.549 --> 14:03.592
But you have a large class
and he can get lost from sight

14:03.719 --> 14:05.553
if you're not looking.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.431
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.600
Nemo!

14:13.145 --> 14:14.687
What do you think you're doing?

14:16.398 --> 14:17.732
You're going to get stuck

14:17.816 --> 14:20.693
and I'm going to have to get you
before another fish does.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.404
Get back here.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.948
I said get back here now!

14:27.159 --> 14:28.743
Stop.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.870
You take one more move, mister...

14:31.997 --> 14:35.249
Don't you dare.
If you put one fin on that boat...

14:35.333 --> 14:36.834
Are you listening to me?

14:36.918 --> 14:38.961
Don't touch the boa...

14:39.045 --> 14:40.045
Nemo!

14:40.338 --> 14:41.714
He touched the butt.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.592
You paddle your little tail back here.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.470
That's right.
You are in big trouble, young man.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.638
Do you hear me? Big...

14:56.313 --> 14:58.397
Daddy, help me!

14:59.065 --> 15:00.983
I'm coming, Nemo.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.570
Get under me, kids.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.323
No! Dad!

15:15.248 --> 15:16.332
Nemo!

15:20.170 --> 15:22.254
Nemo! Nemo, no!

15:23.507 --> 15:24.632
Nemo!

15:24.716 --> 15:25.925
Nemo, Nemo!

15:26.384 --> 15:27.384
No!

15:29.679 --> 15:31.013
No!

15:41.107 --> 15:42.858
Nemo, Nemo!

15:53.078 --> 15:54.411
Hold on!

16:06.842 --> 16:07.883
Oh, no.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.469
No. It's gone. It's gone.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.888
It can't be gone. No. No!

16:12.973 --> 16:15.140
Nemo! Nemo...

16:15.725 --> 16:17.434
Nemo!

16:17.519 --> 16:18.727
No.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.481
Nemo! Nemo!

16:22.566 --> 16:23.607
No.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.150
No. Please, no.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.071
No, no.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.325
Has anybody seen a boat?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.244
Please. A white boat?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.746
My son! My son!

16:37.831 --> 16:39.164
Help me. Please.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.583
Look out!

16:45.380 --> 16:48.007
Sorry. I didn't see you, sir.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.508
Are you okay?

16:49.593 --> 16:51.260
- He's gone.
- There, there.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.012
- He's gone.
- It's all right.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.514
- It'll be okay.
- No, they took him away.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.182
I have to find the boat.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.852
- A boat? I've seen a boat.
- You have?

16:59.936 --> 17:02.980
- And it passed by not too long ago.
- A white one?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.107
- Hi. I'm Dory.
- Where? Which way?

17:05.983 --> 17:08.193
It went this way.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.529
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.989
Thank you so much.

17:12.073 --> 17:13.574
No problem.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.226
Wait.

17:48.234 --> 17:52.279
Quit it. I'm trying to swim here.
The ocean isn't big enough for you?

17:52.364 --> 17:54.490
You got a problem, buddy?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.824
Do you? Do you?

17:55.909 --> 17:58.035
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.662
I'm scared now!

17:59.746 --> 18:01.747
- Wait.
- Stop following me, okay?

18:01.831 --> 18:04.917
What? You're showing me
which way the boat went.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.671
A boat? I've seen a boat.
It passed by not too long ago.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.674
It went this way. Follow me.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.759
Wait a minute. What is going on?

18:13.843 --> 18:15.886
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.139
I did? Oh, no.

18:19.224 --> 18:23.018
If this is some kind of joke,
it's not funny and I know funny.

18:23.103 --> 18:27.314
- I'm a clownfish.
- No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.776
See, I suffer from
short-term memory loss.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.195
Short-term memory loss.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.114
- I don't believe this.
- No.

18:35.198 --> 18:38.701
I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.536
At least I think it does.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.373
Where are they?

18:49.004 --> 18:50.129
Can I help you?

18:51.047 --> 18:53.424
Something's wrong with you. Really.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.300
You're wasting my time.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.261
I have to find my son.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.724
Hello.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.851
Well, hi!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.353
Name's Bruce.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.106
It's all right. I understand.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.608
Why trust a shark, right?

19:19.784 --> 19:24.329
So, what's a couple of bites like you
doing out so late?

19:24.414 --> 19:26.373
Nothing. We're not even out.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.708
Great.

19:27.792 --> 19:32.296
Then how would you morsels like to
come to a little get-together I'm having?

19:32.380 --> 19:36.592
- You mean like a party?
- Yeah, right. A party.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.845
- What do you say?
- I love parties. That sounds like fun.

19:39.929 --> 19:43.515
Parties are fun and it's tempting,
but we can't because...

19:43.600 --> 19:46.018
Come on. I insist.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.604
Okay. That's all that matters.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.401
Look. Balloons. It is a party.

19:55.278 --> 19:59.406
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.241
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

20:16.424 --> 20:17.883
Anchor! Chum!

20:18.968 --> 20:20.719
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.597
- We got company.
- It's about time, mate.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.558
We've gone through the snacks
and I'm starving.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.769
We almost had to have
a feeding frenzy.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.479
Let's get this over with.

20:32.774 --> 20:36.068
Right then. The meeting has
officially come to order.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.778
Let us all say the pledge.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.738
I am a nice shark,

20:39.823 --> 20:42.199
not a mindless eating machine.

20:42.283 --> 20:46.954
If I am to change this image,
I must first change myself.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.706
Fish are friends, not food.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.416
Except stinking dolphins.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.378
Dolphins!
Yeah, they think they're so cute.

20:54.462 --> 20:58.590
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin.
Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

20:58.675 --> 21:02.219
Today's meeting is step five:
Bring a Fish Friend.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.513
- Do you all have your friends?
- Got mine.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.017
- Hey there!
- How about you, Chum?

21:09.102 --> 21:12.813
Well, I seem to have misplaced my

21:12.897 --> 21:14.523
friend.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.567
It's all right, Chum.

21:16.651 --> 21:19.570
Help yourself to one of my friends.

21:19.654 --> 21:23.115
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.827
I'll start the testimonies.
Hello. My name is Bruce.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.120
Hello, Bruce.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.415
It has been three weeks
since my last fish, on my honour,

21:31.499 --> 21:33.792
or may I be chopped up
and made into soup.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.670
- You're an inspiration to us.
- Amen.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.632
- Right, then. Who's next?
- Pick me. Pick me.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.551
The little sheila down the front.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.887
Come on up here.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.556
Hi. I'm Dory.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.183
Hello, Dory.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.603
And... Well, I don't think
I've ever eaten a fish.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.732
- Hey, that's incredible.
- Good on you, mate!

21:57.358 --> 21:58.817
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

21:58.902 --> 22:03.113
Anyone else? How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

22:03.198 --> 22:05.532
Me? I don't have a problem.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.076
- Okay.
- Denial.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.454
Just start with your name.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.789
Okay. Hello.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.918
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.504
- A clownfish? Really?
- Go on. Tell us a joke.

22:19.589 --> 22:20.756
I love jokes.

22:21.049 --> 22:24.051
I actually do know
one that's pretty good.

22:25.094 --> 22:28.555
There was this mollusk
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.059
Normally they don't talk,
but in a joke, everyone talks.

22:32.143 --> 22:35.145
The sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

22:37.690 --> 22:38.941
Daddy!

22:39.484 --> 22:40.567
Nemo!

22:40.944 --> 22:42.778
Nemo!

22:43.529 --> 22:45.864
- I don't get it.
- For a clownfish he's not that funny.

22:45.949 --> 22:50.410
No, he's my son.
He was taken by these divers.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.955
You poor fish.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.333
- Humans. Think they own everything.
- Probably American.

22:56.417 --> 23:00.462
There is a father
looking for his little boy.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.589
What do these markings mean?

23:02.674 --> 23:06.551
- I never knew my father.
- Come here.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.762
- We're all mates here.
- I can't read human.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.932
Then we've got to find a fish
that can read this. Look. Sharks!

23:12.475 --> 23:14.351
- Guys.
- No, Dory.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.812
- That's mine. Give it back.
- Cut it out.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.565
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

23:20.650 --> 23:23.485
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

23:24.988 --> 23:26.989
Dory, are you oka...

23:30.159 --> 23:31.660
That's good.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.537
Intervention!

23:34.289 --> 23:37.249
- Just a bite.
- You hold it together, mate.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.168
- Fish are friends, not food.
- Food!

23:41.004 --> 23:42.754
Dory, look out.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.716
I'm having fish tonight.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.092
Remember the steps, mate.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.141
Just one bite.

23:58.688 --> 23:59.730
G'day.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.028
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way to escape.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.991
- Who is it?
- Help me find a way out.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.869
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.
We're trying to escape.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.372
There's no way out.
There's got to be a way out.

24:17.457 --> 24:21.626
Here's something. "Es-ca-pé."
I wonder what that means.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.795
- It's spelled just like the word "escape."
- Let's go.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.965
Here's Brucie!

24:27.467 --> 24:31.094
- Wait a minute. You can read?
- I can read? That's right!

24:31.179 --> 24:32.679
Then here. Read this now.

24:34.724 --> 24:37.684
He doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.811
Don't fall off the wagon.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.359
Oh, no! It's blocked.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.031
No, Bruce!

24:51.366 --> 24:53.575
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.827
He's really... A nice guy.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.496
I need to get that mask.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.039
You want that mask? Okay.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.500
No, no, no, no!

25:02.502 --> 25:04.127
Quick. Grab the mask.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.176
Oh, no. Bruce.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.427
What?

25:14.597 --> 25:17.349
Swim away!

25:17.433 --> 25:18.850
Is the party over?

25:28.736 --> 25:30.028
Nice.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.991
Dad!

25:37.662 --> 25:39.037
Daddy?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.228
Barbara.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.105
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

26:05.481 --> 26:08.608
- And I'll need more cotton rolls.
- All right.

26:11.654 --> 26:12.737
Hello, little fella.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.157
Beauty, isn't he?

26:15.241 --> 26:18.743
I found that guy struggling for life
and I saved him.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.912
Has that Novocain kicked in yet?

26:25.126 --> 26:26.376
Bubbles!

26:29.964 --> 26:32.883
- My bubbles.
- He likes bubbles.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.941
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.235
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

26:53.154 --> 26:54.571
Do you know where my dad is?

26:54.655 --> 26:57.282
Your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

26:57.366 --> 26:58.700
Pet store?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.912
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
- Pet Palace.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.413
- Fish-O-Rama.
- Mail order.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.748
eBay.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.292
- Which one is it?
- I'm from the ocean.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.419
The ocean. The ocean!

27:11.088 --> 27:14.007
He hasn't been decontaminated yet.
Jacques!

27:14.091 --> 27:15.425
Clean him!

27:17.011 --> 27:18.553
Ocean.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.891
Voilà. He is clean.

27:25.895 --> 27:29.022
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

27:29.565 --> 27:31.858
Big and blue?

27:31.943 --> 27:32.984
I knew it.

27:33.069 --> 27:36.488
If there's anything you need,
ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

27:36.572 --> 27:41.159
If I'm not around you can always
talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

27:41.244 --> 27:44.371
Don't listen to anything my sister says.
She's nuts.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.542
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

27:48.626 --> 27:50.001
- Yes!
- Boy, oh, boy.

27:50.086 --> 27:52.254
- What have we got?
- Root canal.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.588
It's not going to be pretty.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.841
- Clamp installed?
- Yup.

27:56.926 --> 28:00.345
- What did he use to open?
- Glidden drill. He favours that one.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.348
I can't see, Flo.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.186
- Schilder Technique.
- That's a Hedstrom file.

28:08.271 --> 28:10.730
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.817
It's got a teardrop cross section.
A Hedstrom.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.570
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

28:16.654 --> 28:18.738
There I go. Little help. Over here.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.699
I'll go deflate him.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.911
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.290
The human mouth
is a disgusting place.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.752
- Nigel.
- What did I miss?

28:32.837 --> 28:35.839
- Root canal. A doozy.
- What did he use to open?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.591
- Glidden drill.
- He favours it.

28:37.675 --> 28:40.844
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer
at the portal terminus.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.888
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.558
- The dentist took him off the reef.
- An outie.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.394
From my neck of the woods?
Sorry if I took a snap at you.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.730
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

28:51.814 --> 28:56.192
No, no. Those aren't your fish.
They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

28:58.946 --> 29:02.198
The picture broke.
This here's Darla. She's my niece.

29:02.283 --> 29:03.325
Going to be eight this week.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.578
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.080
She's going to be here Friday
to pick you up.

29:09.165 --> 29:10.999
You're her present.

29:11.626 --> 29:13.043
It's our little secret.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.419
Well, Mr Tucker,

29:14.503 --> 29:17.839
while that sets up, I'm going to
go see a man about a wallaby.

29:19.467 --> 29:20.592
Darla!

29:20.676 --> 29:24.346
- What's wrong with her?
- She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.892
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.686
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.231
She's a fish killer.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.819
I can't go with that girl.
I have to get back to my dad.

29:40.946 --> 29:44.199
- Daddy! Help me!
- He's stuck.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.206
Nobody touch him.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.463
Can you help me?

29:58.547 --> 30:01.883
No. You got yourself in there,
you can get yourself out.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.719
- Gill...
- I just want to see him do it, okay?

30:04.804 --> 30:08.306
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

30:08.391 --> 30:11.309
I can't. I have a bad fin.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.103
Never stopped me.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.734
Just think about what you need to do.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.323
Come on.

30:29.662 --> 30:30.662
Perfect.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.581
- You did it.
- Good squirming.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.877
Wow, from the ocean!
Just like you, Gill.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.170
Yeah.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.216
I've seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?

30:43.300 --> 30:48.263
I'm thinking tonight we give
the kid a proper reception.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.641
- So, kid, you got a name or what?
- Nemo.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.143
I'm Nemo.

30:54.311 --> 30:55.562
Nemo.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.064
Nemo.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.779
You going to eat that?

31:15.791 --> 31:17.751
Careful of that hammer.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.595
- Dory!
- Sea-Monkey has my money.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.930
Wake up. Get up.

31:31.015 --> 31:33.600
- Come on.
- Yes, I'm a natural blue.

31:33.684 --> 31:35.477
- Get up!
- Look out. Sharks eat fish!

32:00.002 --> 32:01.503
Wow. Dusty.

32:02.296 --> 32:04.380
The mask. Where's the mask?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.383
No! The mask! Get it!

32:07.468 --> 32:09.385
Get the mask! Get it!

32:19.605 --> 32:21.189
Keeps going on, doesn't it?

32:21.273 --> 32:23.107
Echo! Echo!

32:23.901 --> 32:26.236
- What are you doing?
- I've lost the mask.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.238
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

32:28.322 --> 32:30.865
That was my only chance of
finding my son. Now it's gone.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.288
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.251
- When you're down, know what to do?
- I don't want to know.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.628
Just keep swimming.

32:43.712 --> 32:46.297
Just keep swimming,
swimming, swimming

32:46.382 --> 32:48.633
What do we do? We swim

32:48.717 --> 32:50.468
Dory, no singing.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.263
I love to swim

32:53.347 --> 32:56.933
And when you want to swim
you want to...

32:57.017 --> 32:59.978
I'm going to get stuck with that song.
It's in my head!

33:00.062 --> 33:01.229
Sorry.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.358
- See anything?
- Something's got me!

33:05.442 --> 33:07.402
- That was me. Sorry.
- Who's that?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.737
Who could it be? It's me.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.448
Are... Are you my conscience?

33:13.576 --> 33:15.660
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.580
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.707
- Can't complain.
- Good.

33:20.791 --> 33:24.294
Now, Dory, I want you to tell me,
do you see anything?

33:24.378 --> 33:26.254
I see a...

33:27.131 --> 33:28.756
- I see a light.
- A light?

33:28.841 --> 33:30.967
Yeah. Over there.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.760
Hey, conscience, am I dead?

33:32.845 --> 33:34.345
I see it, too.

33:41.896 --> 33:43.313
What is it?

33:44.106 --> 33:46.774
It's so pretty!

33:48.694 --> 33:50.111
I...

33:50.195 --> 33:52.447
I'm feeling happy.

33:53.616 --> 33:56.910
Which is a big deal for me.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.745
I want to touch it.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.415
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.334
I'm going to get you.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.294
I'm going to get you.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.212
I'm going to swim with you

34:08.297 --> 34:11.049
I'm going to be your best friend

34:11.132 --> 34:12.467
Good feeling's gone.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.018
I can't see.
I don't know where I'm going.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.980
- The mask!
- What mask?

34:27.149 --> 34:29.233
Okay. I can't see a thing.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.027
Whoa, geez.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.154
- Look. A mask.
- Read it!

34:34.322 --> 34:38.242
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it
a little closer. I need the light.

34:38.327 --> 34:40.411
That's great. Keep it right there.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.331
- Just read it!
- Okay, okay.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.873
Mr Bossy.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.418
"P." Okay. P.

34:47.503 --> 34:49.087
"Sher..."

34:49.880 --> 34:51.755
P. Sher... P. Shirley...

34:51.840 --> 34:53.341
P not Shirley.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.427
The first line's "P. Sherman."

34:56.512 --> 34:59.097
"P. Sherman" doesn't make any sense!

34:59.181 --> 35:00.556
Second line.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.183
"42..."

35:05.062 --> 35:06.980
Light, please.

35:07.064 --> 35:10.692
"Walla... Wallaby."

35:13.320 --> 35:15.780
The second line's "42 Wallaby Way."

35:15.864 --> 35:18.950
Just finish up. Speed read.
No pressure.

35:19.034 --> 35:22.036
There's a lot of pressure!
Take a guess, with pressure.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.539
- Sydney. It's Sydney!
- Duck!

35:28.711 --> 35:30.670
I'm dead. I'm dead.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.547
I died. I'm dead.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.473
We did it, we did it

35:42.558 --> 35:44.225
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

35:44.309 --> 35:47.478
No eating here tonight,
eating here tonight

35:47.563 --> 35:50.314
No eating here tonight
You're on a diet

35:50.399 --> 35:53.276
Dory. What did it say?
What did the mask say?

35:53.360 --> 35:55.903
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

35:55.988 --> 35:59.365
I remembered what it said!
I forget things, but I remembered it.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.492
- P. Sherman...
- Where is that?

36:01.577 --> 36:04.120
I don't know. But who cares?
I remembered.

36:05.664 --> 36:09.292
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered it again!

36:38.572 --> 36:39.989
Nemo.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.658
Nemo!

36:48.457 --> 36:49.916
Follow me.

37:47.850 --> 37:49.183
State your name.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.269
Nemo.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.729
Brother Bloat, proceed.

37:55.357 --> 37:58.734
Nemo, newcomer of orange and white.

37:58.986 --> 38:03.239
You have been called forth to the
summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie

38:03.323 --> 38:08.035
to join with us
in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

38:09.746 --> 38:12.123
- We want you in our club, kid.
- Really?

38:12.207 --> 38:15.960
If you are able to swim through

38:16.044 --> 38:19.547
the Ring of Fire!

38:23.635 --> 38:27.013
Turn on the Ring of Fire.
You said you could do it.

38:27.097 --> 38:28.890
The Ring of Fire!

38:31.268 --> 38:33.144
Bubbles. Let me...

38:40.986 --> 38:43.821
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.295
From this moment on,
you will now be known as Sharkbait.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.671
Sharkbait!

39:00.756 --> 39:02.465
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.

39:02.549 --> 39:03.758
Sharkbait.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.594
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait...

39:07.763 --> 39:10.014
- Sharkbait's one of us now.
- Agreed.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.517
We can't send him to his death.
Darla's coming in five days.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.102
So what are we going to do?

39:16.355 --> 39:18.064
I'll tell you.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.858
We're going to get him out of here.
We'll help him escape.

39:20.943 --> 39:23.402
- Escape? Really?
- We're all going to escape.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.072
Not another one of your escape plans.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.199
Sorry, but they never work.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.742
Yeah, why should this be any different?

39:30.244 --> 39:33.204
- 'Cause we've got him.
- Me?

39:33.288 --> 39:34.956
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.751
You're the only one who can
get in and out of that thing.

39:38.835 --> 39:43.047
We need you to take a pebble
inside there and jam the gears.

39:43.131 --> 39:46.926
You do that and this tank's going to
get filthier by the minute.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.679
Soon the dentist
will have to clean the tank.

39:49.763 --> 39:53.891
When he does, he'll take us out of
the tank, put us in individual baggies,

39:53.976 --> 39:56.894
then we'll roll down the counter,
out of the window,

39:56.979 --> 40:00.481
off the awning, into the bushes,
across the street and into the harbour.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.150
It's foolproof.

40:03.694 --> 40:06.237
- Who's with me?
- I.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.155
I think you're nuts.

40:08.532 --> 40:11.492
No offence, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.328
He's fine. He can do this.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.540
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

40:17.624 --> 40:18.833
Let's do it!

40:23.422 --> 40:26.549
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?

40:26.633 --> 40:28.926
To P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

40:29.011 --> 40:31.345
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

40:31.430 --> 40:36.767
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.062
Excuse me. Excuse me.

40:40.147 --> 40:42.481
Hi. Do you know how to get... Hello?

40:42.566 --> 40:45.318
Wait. Can you tell me... Hey!

40:45.402 --> 40:46.777
Hold it!

40:46.862 --> 40:48.821
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.449
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

40:51.533 --> 40:55.369
One quick question. I need to...
And they're gone again.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.789
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

40:58.874 --> 41:01.042
Why do I have to tell you again?

41:01.126 --> 41:04.628
- I don't get tired of it.
- All right, here's the thing.

41:05.547 --> 41:09.925
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

41:11.094 --> 41:13.387
- By myself.
- Okay.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.014
You know. Alone.

41:15.098 --> 41:20.019
Without... Well, not without you,
but I don't want you with me.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.190
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

41:24.274 --> 41:26.984
- You want me to leave?
- Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

41:27.069 --> 41:29.653
I just can't afford any more delays.

41:29.738 --> 41:32.615
You're one of
those fish that cause delays.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.743
Sometimes it's a good thing.
There's a group of fish.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.287
- They're delay fish.
- You mean...

41:39.122 --> 41:42.625
- You mean you don't like me?
- Of course I like you.

41:42.709 --> 41:45.169
Because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.421
It's a complicated emotion.

41:48.924 --> 41:51.258
Don't cry. I like you.

41:51.343 --> 41:52.468
Hey, you!

41:53.220 --> 41:55.554
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

41:55.639 --> 41:59.558
- I don't remember. Were you?
- No, no. We're just...

41:59.643 --> 42:01.519
Do you guys know how I can get...

42:01.603 --> 42:05.314
We're talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?

42:06.983 --> 42:09.902
Okay.
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.695
What are we? Take a guess.

42:11.780 --> 42:14.824
- I've seen one of those.
- I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.867
- Wait.
- It's a swordfish.

42:16.952 --> 42:19.537
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

42:20.247 --> 42:21.539
Where's the butter?

42:22.082 --> 42:23.874
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- Lobster.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.376
- Saw that.
- What?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.503
- Lots of legs.
- Clam?

42:27.587 --> 42:28.796
Close enough.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.340
It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad

42:31.425 --> 42:33.676
- They're good.
- Somebody give me directions?

42:34.428 --> 42:37.555
"Would somebody give me directions?"

42:37.639 --> 42:39.974
- I'm serious.
- Blah, blah, me, me.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.517
Blah, blah, blah, me, me.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.185
Thank you.

42:43.270 --> 42:45.479
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

42:46.398 --> 42:48.399
What's the matter?

42:48.483 --> 42:50.609
While they're doing impressions,

42:50.694 --> 42:52.236
I am miles from home

42:52.320 --> 42:54.363
with a fish that can't even
remember her own name.

42:54.573 --> 42:57.199
- I bet that's frustrating.
- My son is out there.

42:57.284 --> 42:59.201
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo.

42:59.286 --> 43:02.913
It doesn't matter. 'Cause no fish
in this ocean is going to help me.

43:02.998 --> 43:04.665
I'm helping you.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.335
Wait right here.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.755
- Guys.
- Is he bothering you again?

43:11.840 --> 43:13.424
No, he's a good guy.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.885
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

43:15.969 --> 43:18.471
Heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

43:18.555 --> 43:20.931
Sydney? Oh, sure.

43:21.016 --> 43:23.934
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.
Don't you, Ted?

43:24.019 --> 43:27.396
- Sure do.
- Hey, they know Sydney!

43:27.481 --> 43:31.108
- You wouldn't know how to get there?
- Follow the EAC.

43:31.193 --> 43:33.777
That's East Australian Current.

43:33.862 --> 43:36.947
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in

43:37.032 --> 43:38.491
that direction.

43:38.575 --> 43:41.118
Then you got to follow that for about...

43:41.203 --> 43:43.954
What do you guys think?
Three leagues?

43:44.039 --> 43:47.124
That baby's going to
float you right past Sydney.

43:47.209 --> 43:48.709
Great! That's great!

43:48.793 --> 43:50.836
- Dory, you did it.
- Oh, please.

43:50.921 --> 43:53.130
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

43:53.215 --> 43:55.466
- Fellas, thank you.
- Don't mention it.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.010
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

43:58.094 --> 44:01.180
You guys! You really nailed him. Bye.

44:01.264 --> 44:02.848
- Ma'am. One more thing.
- Yes?

44:02.933 --> 44:06.560
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

44:06.645 --> 44:09.730
Trench. Through it.
Not over it. I'll remember.

44:09.814 --> 44:11.065
Hey!

44:13.318 --> 44:14.777
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

44:15.403 --> 44:18.697
Wait. I've got to tell you something.
Whoa.

44:20.534 --> 44:22.368
Nice trench.

44:24.746 --> 44:26.830
Hello!

44:30.502 --> 44:33.003
- Let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench. Bad trench.

44:33.088 --> 44:37.049
- We're going to swim over this thing.
- Little red flag going up.

44:37.133 --> 44:40.177
Something's telling me
we should swim through it.

44:40.262 --> 44:43.389
Are you looking at this thing?
It's got death written on it.

44:43.473 --> 44:46.267
I'm sorry, but I think
we should swim through.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.477
I'm done talking about this. Over we go.

44:48.562 --> 44:49.979
Come on. Trust me on this.

44:50.063 --> 44:52.439
- Trust you?
- Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

44:53.316 --> 44:54.942
- Something shiny!
- Where?

44:55.026 --> 44:57.987
- It just swam over the trench. Come on.
- Okay.

45:03.118 --> 45:05.953
- Boy, it sure is clear up here.
- Exactly.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.246
And look at that.

45:07.330 --> 45:10.624
There's the current.
We should be there in no time.

45:11.084 --> 45:14.211
- Hey, little guy.
- You wanted to go through the trench.

45:14.296 --> 45:18.716
I shall call him Squishy and
he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.843
Come here, little Squishy.

45:23.805 --> 45:26.932
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy.

45:27.017 --> 45:28.392
Shoo! Get away.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.352
- Let me see.
- Don't touch it.

45:30.437 --> 45:32.896
I'm not going to touch it.
I just want to look.

45:32.981 --> 45:34.857
How come it didn't sting you?

45:34.941 --> 45:37.401
It did. Hold still.

45:38.236 --> 45:42.740
I live in this anemone and I'm used to
these kind of stings. Come here.

45:42.824 --> 45:44.867
You're going to be fine.

45:44.951 --> 45:48.245
But now we know
that we don't want to touch these again.

45:48.330 --> 45:50.873
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

45:54.336 --> 45:55.502
Don't move.

45:57.672 --> 45:59.632
This is bad, Dory.

46:00.425 --> 46:03.886
- Boing. Boing.
- Dory!

46:03.970 --> 46:05.638
You can't catch me.

46:05.722 --> 46:08.349
Don't bounce on the tops. They will

46:08.433 --> 46:10.267
not sting you!

46:10.352 --> 46:13.687
- The tops don't sting you.
- Two in a row. Beat that.

46:13.772 --> 46:15.397
Listen to me. I have an idea.

46:15.482 --> 46:17.274
- A game.
- A game?

46:17.359 --> 46:19.026
I love games. Pick me.

46:19.110 --> 46:23.656
Here's the game. Whoever can hop
the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.282
- Okay!
- Rules.

46:25.367 --> 46:27.868
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

46:27.952 --> 46:31.538
Something about tentacles. Got it.
On your mark. Get set. Go!

46:32.874 --> 46:34.416
Wait!

46:34.501 --> 46:36.543
Go faster if you want to win.

46:36.628 --> 46:39.046
- Dory!
- Boing, boing, boing!

46:40.006 --> 46:42.091
Wait a minute.

46:44.511 --> 46:46.303
So, we're cheating death now.

46:46.388 --> 46:48.972
We're having fun at the same time.

46:49.057 --> 46:50.766
I can do this. Just be careful.

46:50.850 --> 46:52.518
Careful I don't make you cry when I win.

46:52.602 --> 46:54.061
I don't think so!

46:57.357 --> 47:00.734
Give it up. You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

47:00.819 --> 47:03.278
- The question is, are you hungry?
- Hungry?

47:03.363 --> 47:05.864
Yeah. 'Cause you're about to
eat my bubbles!

47:06.533 --> 47:09.493
Duck to the left, back
and coming over, right there!

47:11.579 --> 47:14.373
The clownfish is the winner!

47:14.457 --> 47:16.917
We did it. Look at us!

47:17.001 --> 47:18.252
Dory?

47:20.755 --> 47:21.755
Oh, no.

47:23.258 --> 47:27.052
Dory! Dory! Dory!

47:29.931 --> 47:31.515
Dory!

47:37.063 --> 47:38.522
Am I disqualified?

47:38.606 --> 47:40.691
You're doing fine. You're winning.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.527
Stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

47:43.611 --> 47:46.780
P. Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

47:46.865 --> 47:48.323
That's it!

47:51.703 --> 47:54.621
Stay awake. Stay awake. Stay awake.

47:54.956 --> 47:57.916
Stay awake!

48:01.629 --> 48:04.047
- Awake...
- P. Sherman...

48:04.716 --> 48:07.259
- Awake...
- 42 Wallaby Way...

48:08.094 --> 48:10.012
- Wake up.
- Sydney.

48:10.096 --> 48:11.138
Nemo...

48:26.446 --> 48:28.697
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

48:28.782 --> 48:29.907
Yeah.

48:29.991 --> 48:33.869
Well, you're lucky to have someone
out there who's looking for you.

48:33.953 --> 48:36.121
He's not looking for me.

48:36.206 --> 48:38.290
He's scared of the ocean.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.168
Peach? Any movement?

48:41.252 --> 48:43.921
He's had four cups of coffee.
It's got to be soon.

48:44.172 --> 48:45.672
Keep on him.

48:48.343 --> 48:51.136
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

48:51.221 --> 48:53.597
- I was aiming for the toilet.
- The toilet?

48:53.681 --> 48:56.558
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

48:56.643 --> 48:59.645
Wow. How many times
have you tried to get out?

48:59.729 --> 49:04.775
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be
in a box, kid. It does things to you.

49:04.859 --> 49:06.944
The bubbles, the bubbles!

49:07.028 --> 49:11.114
Potty break! He just grabbed the
Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes.

49:11.199 --> 49:12.783
That's your cue.

49:12.867 --> 49:15.244
- You can do it, kid.
- We got to be quick.

49:15.328 --> 49:19.623
Once you get in, swim to the bottom
and I'll talk you through the rest.

49:19.707 --> 49:20.707
Okay.

49:20.792 --> 49:23.168
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

49:31.344 --> 49:33.971
- Nicely done. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

49:34.055 --> 49:35.973
Here comes the pebble.

49:42.146 --> 49:45.691
Now, do you see a small opening?

49:45.775 --> 49:48.902
Okay. Inside it you'll see a rotating fan.

49:48.987 --> 49:53.407
Very carefully, wedge that pebble
into the fan to stop it turning.

49:57.954 --> 49:59.329
Careful, Sharkbait.

49:59.414 --> 50:02.082
- I can't do it.
- This isn't a good idea.

50:02.166 --> 50:03.876
He'll be fine. Try again!

50:04.168 --> 50:05.544
Okay.

50:06.588 --> 50:09.298
That's it, Sharkbait.

50:09.382 --> 50:11.633
Nice and steady.

50:14.178 --> 50:17.097
- I got it, I got it!
- He did it.

50:17.181 --> 50:20.392
That's great, kid.
Now swim up the tube and out.

50:37.952 --> 50:39.953
Oh, no! Gill!

50:40.663 --> 50:42.956
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

50:43.041 --> 50:44.541
- Help him!
- What do we do?

50:44.626 --> 50:47.502
- Oh, no!
- Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

50:49.005 --> 50:52.174
- Help me!
- Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

50:55.887 --> 50:56.887
No!

50:56.971 --> 50:58.889
- Feed me more.
- That's it!

50:58.973 --> 51:01.099
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.686
- I got it.
- Pull!

51:12.487 --> 51:14.821
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

51:16.324 --> 51:19.660
No. We're done.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.258
Dude?

51:36.552 --> 51:37.886
Dude?

51:38.680 --> 51:40.472
Focus, dude.

51:41.265 --> 51:42.516
Dude?

51:44.268 --> 51:45.811
He lives. Hey, dude.

51:48.564 --> 51:51.525
- What happened?
- I saw the whole thing, dude.

51:51.609 --> 51:55.028
First you were all, like, whoa!
And then we were all, like, whoa!

51:55.113 --> 51:58.323
- Then you were, like, whoa...
- What are you talking about?

51:58.408 --> 52:05.288
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.

52:05.373 --> 52:06.581
Awesome.

52:07.041 --> 52:08.542
Oh, my stomach.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.421
Man, no hurling on the shell.
I just waxed it.

52:13.673 --> 52:16.967
- So, Mr Turtle...
- Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.552
Name's Crush.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.637
Crush? Really?

52:21.222 --> 52:22.472
Okay, Crush.

52:22.557 --> 52:25.934
Listen, I need to get to
the East Australian Current.

52:26.019 --> 52:27.477
EAC?

52:27.562 --> 52:29.104
Dude...

52:29.188 --> 52:31.356
You're riding it, dude.

52:31.441 --> 52:33.233
Check it out.

52:55.214 --> 52:56.715
Okay, grab shell, dude.

52:56.799 --> 52:59.009
Grab what?

53:08.770 --> 53:10.520
Righteous! Righteous!

53:15.526 --> 53:16.985
So,

53:17.820 --> 53:21.573
what brings you on this fine day
to the EAC?

53:21.657 --> 53:24.659
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.

53:24.744 --> 53:26.953
Dory! Is she all right?

53:27.413 --> 53:29.581
Oh, little blue.

53:29.665 --> 53:30.832
She is sub-level, dude.

53:35.088 --> 53:37.047
Dory, Dory! Dory!

53:38.007 --> 53:39.216
Oh, Dory.

53:42.178 --> 53:43.804
I'm so sorry.

53:44.472 --> 53:47.349
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

53:47.433 --> 53:50.435
...twenty-nine, 30!
Ready or not, here I come!

53:53.147 --> 53:54.272
There you are.

53:54.982 --> 53:56.483
Catch me if you can.

54:06.494 --> 54:08.286
Up you go!

54:18.798 --> 54:20.090
Oh, my goodness.

54:20.174 --> 54:24.261
Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

54:33.104 --> 54:35.897
Whoa! That was so cool.

54:35.982 --> 54:38.775
Hey, Dad. Did you see that?
Did you see me?

54:38.860 --> 54:43.029
- Did you see what I did?
- You so totally rock, Squirt.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.781
Give me some fin.

54:44.866 --> 54:45.949
Noggin.

54:46.033 --> 54:47.367
Dude.

54:48.202 --> 54:52.873
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.

54:52.957 --> 54:56.418
- Jellies? Sweet.
- Totally.

54:56.502 --> 54:59.713
I must have done
something you all liked, dudes.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.381
You rock, dude.

55:02.842 --> 55:05.010
Curl away, my son.

55:05.094 --> 55:06.970
It's awesome, Jellyman.

55:07.054 --> 55:10.432
When the little dudes are eggs
we leave them on a beach to hatch,

55:10.725 --> 55:14.477
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find
their way back to the big ol' blue.

55:14.562 --> 55:16.646
- All by themselves?
- Yeah!

55:16.731 --> 55:19.649
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

55:19.734 --> 55:23.904
You never really know, but when
they know, you'll know. You know?

55:28.784 --> 55:31.328
- Hey, look, everybody.
- I know that dude.

55:31.412 --> 55:32.704
It's the Jellyman.

55:33.414 --> 55:36.208
- Well go on. Jump on him.
- Turtle pile!

55:36.292 --> 55:38.001
Wait. Kids!

55:38.085 --> 55:39.961
- You funny?
- Where's your shell?

55:40.046 --> 55:42.339
- Do your stripes come off?
- I need to breathe.

55:42.423 --> 55:44.633
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

55:44.717 --> 55:47.719
- One at a time.
- Mr Fish, did you die?

55:47.803 --> 55:49.930
Sorry. I was vague on the details.

55:50.014 --> 55:53.516
- So where are you going?
- You see, my son was taken.

55:53.601 --> 55:55.852
My son was taken away from me.

55:56.729 --> 55:58.647
- No way!
- What happened?

55:58.731 --> 56:01.691
No, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

56:01.776 --> 56:04.277
- Come on.
- Please.

56:05.696 --> 56:06.696
Well, okay.

56:07.490 --> 56:10.992
I live on this reef, a long way from here.

56:11.244 --> 56:13.328
This is going to be good. I can tell.

56:13.412 --> 56:17.540
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

56:18.292 --> 56:20.961
Maybe he wouldn't have done it
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.379
I don't know.

56:22.463 --> 56:24.881
He swam in the open water to this boat

56:24.966 --> 56:28.426
and these divers appeared
and I tried to stop them.

56:28.511 --> 56:31.388
The boat was too fast,
so we swam out in the ocean...

56:31.472 --> 56:32.639
He couldn't stop them.

56:32.723 --> 56:35.517
Then Nemo's dad,
he swims out to the ocean

56:35.601 --> 56:37.852
and they bump into three sharks.

56:37.937 --> 56:40.355
He scares them away
by blowing them up.

56:40.439 --> 56:43.149
- That's amazing.
- Then dives thousands of feet...

56:43.234 --> 56:47.404
Straight into the dark. It's wicked
dark there. You can't see a thing.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.948
The only thing
they can see down there is...

56:50.032 --> 56:53.743
This big, horrible creature with
razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

56:53.828 --> 56:55.328
Then he has to blast his way...

56:55.413 --> 56:58.373
These fish have been
searching the ocean for days

56:58.457 --> 57:00.250
on the East Australian Current.

57:00.334 --> 57:02.377
He may be on his way here right now.

57:02.461 --> 57:04.087
That should put him
in Sydney Harbour...

57:04.171 --> 57:05.547
In a few days.

57:05.631 --> 57:07.590
This guy will stop at nothing...

57:07.675 --> 57:10.468
...stop at nothing until he finds his son.
I hope he makes it.

57:10.553 --> 57:13.388
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

57:20.021 --> 57:22.522
Mine. Mine. Mine.

57:28.654 --> 57:31.364
Would you just shut up?

57:31.449 --> 57:35.243
- You're rats with wings.
- This bloke's looking for his boy, Nemo.

57:35.328 --> 57:38.997
- He was taken off the reef by divers...
- There. Take it.

57:40.041 --> 57:42.625
Say that again.
You said something about Nemo.

57:42.710 --> 57:44.419
Mine. Mine. Mine.

57:47.214 --> 57:48.214
Mine.

57:48.299 --> 57:51.468
Last I heard,
he's heading towards the harbour.

57:51.552 --> 57:52.886
Brilliant!

58:06.692 --> 58:08.068
Is he doing okay?

58:08.152 --> 58:11.404
I don't know, but whatever you do,
don't mention D-A-R...

58:11.489 --> 58:14.532
It's okay.
I know who you're talking about.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.084
Gill?

58:26.462 --> 58:27.545
Gill?

58:29.048 --> 58:30.256
Hey, Sharkbait.

58:31.300 --> 58:34.719
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop...
- I'm the one who should be sorry.

58:36.013 --> 58:40.225
I was so ready to get out,
so ready to taste that ocean,

58:40.851 --> 58:43.603
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

58:44.897 --> 58:47.107
Nothing should be worth that.

58:48.609 --> 58:50.944
I'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

58:55.241 --> 58:57.242
All right. Hey, hey, hey!

58:57.993 --> 58:59.452
What the...

58:59.537 --> 59:02.122
Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.

59:04.625 --> 59:08.628
Darn kids. Well, good thing
I pulled the right one, eh?

59:10.047 --> 59:12.173
Nigel, you just missed an extraction.

59:12.258 --> 59:14.968
Has he loosened
the periodontal ligament yet?

59:15.052 --> 59:17.220
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

59:17.304 --> 59:18.930
I've got to speak with him.

59:19.014 --> 59:22.058
Your dad's been fighting the ocean
looking for you.

59:22.143 --> 59:24.144
My father? Really?

59:24.228 --> 59:26.062
He's travelled hundreds of miles.

59:26.147 --> 59:29.357
- He's been battling sharks and jellyfish.
- Sharks?

59:29.442 --> 59:32.360
- That can't be him.
- Are you sure? What was his name?

59:32.445 --> 59:34.446
Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout?

59:34.530 --> 59:36.114
- Marlin?
- That's it.

59:36.198 --> 59:39.784
- The clownfish from the reef.
- It's my dad! He took on a shark!

59:39.869 --> 59:42.871
- I heard he took on three.
- Three?

59:42.955 --> 59:45.248
- Three sharks?
- That's 4,800 teeth!

59:45.332 --> 59:47.500
After you were taken by Diver Dan,

59:47.585 --> 59:49.586
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

59:49.670 --> 59:50.837
Really?

59:50.921 --> 59:54.507
He's giving it all he's got
and then three sharks capture him.

59:54.592 --> 59:57.385
He blows 'em up
and then dives thousands of feet

59:57.470 --> 59:59.929
and gets chased
by a monster with huge teeth!

01:00:00.014 --> 01:00:02.557
He ties this demon to a rock.
And his reward?

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:05.018
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:08.229
Now he's with sea turtles
on the East Australian Current

01:00:08.314 --> 01:00:11.774
and the word is he's headed this way,
right now, to Sydney!

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:15.862
- What a good daddy.
- He was looking for you after all.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:22.452
- He's swimming in the filter!
- Not again!

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:25.705
Sharkbait!

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.043
- No!
- You've got your life ahead of you.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.045
- We'll help you.
- Get him out.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.386
- Get him out of there.
- Come on. Grab the end.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:43.389
Are you okay?

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:46.476
Can you hear me, Sharkbait?
Nemo? Can you hear me?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.019
Yeah, I can hear you.

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.730
Sharkbait, you did it!

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.733
Sharkbait, you're...
Covered with germs!

01:00:54.235 --> 01:00:55.693
That took guts.

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:59.948
All right, we have less than
48 hours before Darla gets here.

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:02.075
This tank will get plenty dirty
in that time,

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.327
but we have to help it along.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.871
- Jacques, no cleaning.
- I shall resist.

01:01:06.956 --> 01:01:09.666
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.209
Think dirty thoughts.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:14.879
We're going to make this tank so filthy,
the dentist'll have to clean it.

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:16.798
Good work.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.183
All right, we're here, dudes.

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:30.061
Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:33.731
- Where? I don't see it.
- Right there. I see it. I see it.

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:38.570
- You mean the swirling vortex of terror?
- That's it, dude.

01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:42.532
- Of course it is.
- First, find your exit buddy.

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:46.786
- Do you have your exit buddy?
- Yes.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:52.333
Squirt here will now give you a rundown
on proper exiting technique.

01:01:52.418 --> 01:01:55.503
Good afternoon. We're going to have
a great jump today.

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:59.716
Crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.719
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out.

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:05.555
Remember, rip it, roll it and punch it!

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.225
It's like he's trying to speak to me,
I know it.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:14.022
You're really cute, but I don't know what
you're saying. Say the first thing again.

01:02:14.106 --> 01:02:17.066
Okay, Jellyman. Go, go, go!

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.659
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.999
That was fun.

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:35.293
I actually enjoyed that.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:36.836
Hey, look! Turtles.

01:02:38.297 --> 01:02:39.756
Most excellent.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.386
Now, turn your fishy tails round and
swim straight on through to Sydney.

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:47.055
No worries, man.

01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:49.682
No worries. Thank you, Dude Crush.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.976
- Bye.
- See you, Jellyman.

01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:54.395
Tell your little dude I said hi, okay?

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.023
- See ya later, dudes.
- Bye, everyone.

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.692
Nemo would have loved this.

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:04.405
Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.491
150, dude!

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:09.285
And still young. Rock on!

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:12.664
150. I got to remember that.

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:15.041
Whoa.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.923
- We going in there?
- Yep.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.883
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.009
Yep.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.554
We're going to just swim straight.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.933
Just keep swimming

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:33.434
Dory...

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.279
Boy, this is taking a while.

01:03:45.364 --> 01:03:47.907
- Hey, how about we play a game?
- Okay.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.327
Okay, I'm thinking of something orange.

01:03:51.412 --> 01:03:53.204
- And it's small...
- It's me.

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:54.330
Right.

01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:58.793
This one you'll never guess.
It's orange and small.

01:03:58.877 --> 01:03:59.877
It's me.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.838
All righty, Mr Smarty Pants.

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:05.174
It's orange and small
and white stripes...

01:04:05.259 --> 01:04:07.385
Me. And the next one, just a guess, me.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:08.678
Okay. That's just scary.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.848
Wait. I've seen
this floating speck before.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.517
That means we've passed it.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.894
That means we're not going straight.

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:19.939
We got to get to the surface.
We'll figure it out there.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:21.190
- Hey!
- What?

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:23.568
Relax. Take a deep breath.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.699
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:32.243
Fine. Who? The speck?
There's nobody here!

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:34.787
There has to be someone.
It's the ocean.

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:37.540
We're not the only two in here.
Let's see...

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.417
Okay, no one there.

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:41.002
Nope.

01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:47.508
- There's somebody. Hey, excu...
- Dory!

01:04:47.593 --> 01:04:50.052
I'm thinking of something mysterious.

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:54.307
It's a fish we don't know, and if we
ask it directions, it could ingest us.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.893
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

01:04:56.977 --> 01:05:00.563
Don't play the gender card.
Let's play the "let's not die" card.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.607
- Want to get out of here?
- Of course.

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:06.736
How are we going to do that unless
we give it a shot and hope for the best?

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.906
- You don't fully understand.
- Trust me on this.

01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:20.333
All right.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:25.129
Excuse me? Little fella?

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:27.548
Hello.

01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:29.467
Don't be rude. Say hi.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.177
Hello.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.596
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.932
- ...was taken to...
- Sydney.

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:37.350
Sydney, yes.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:41.229
It's really important
that we get there as fast as we can.

01:05:41.313 --> 01:05:43.064
Can you help us out?

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.692
Come on, little fella. Come on.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.946
Dory, I'm a little fella.

01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:53.324
I don't think that's a little fella.

01:05:55.828 --> 01:05:58.162
Big fella. Whale. Okay.

01:05:58.247 --> 01:06:00.373
Maybe he only speaks whale.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.293
We need

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:07.588
to find his son.

01:06:07.673 --> 01:06:10.466
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:13.511
Can you give us...

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.639
- Heaven knows what you're saying.
- ...directions?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:20.059
- See, he's swimming away.
- Come back.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.769
You've offended him.

01:06:21.854 --> 01:06:23.396
Maybe a different dialect.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.902
This is not whale.
You're speaking, like, upset stomach.

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:32.697
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- No, don't.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.909
- You sound sick.
- Maybe louder, huh?

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:38.911
- Don't do that.
- Too much orca.

01:06:38.996 --> 01:06:43.791
- Didn't that sound a little orca-ish?
- It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:47.920
Just as well. He might be hungry.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:51.007
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:53.718
- Swim away!
- Look. Krill!

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.265
Move, Dory! Move!

01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:08.482
Look at that. Would you look at that?

01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:11.861
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:15.364
And it's all thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:17.366
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:18.534
I am ashamed.

01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:21.078
Look. Scum angel.

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:27.960
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:33.424
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.635
9:00, and cue dentist.

01:07:36.595 --> 01:07:38.304
Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:40.598
Okay. Here we go.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.350
Little Davey Reynolds.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:46.687
- Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
- Bloat, that's disgusting.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:49.106
Tastes pretty good to me.

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:52.985
Don't you realise
we are swimming in our own...

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.571
- Here he comes.
- What the...

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.950
Crikey. What a state.

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:06.082
Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.042
- 10:00, love.
- Leave it open.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.629
I've got to clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:16.591
- You hear that, Sharkbait?
- Yay! He's going to clean the tank!

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.551
Yeah, we're going to be clean!

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.554
Ready to see your dad?

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:21.764
Course you are.

01:08:22.224 --> 01:08:27.687
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there
in the harbour waiting for you right now.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:29.854
Yeah.

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:49.518
Here comes a big one!
Come on. You got to try this.

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:53.189
- Will you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:56.067
- We're in a whale. Don't you get it?
- A whale?

01:09:56.151 --> 01:10:00.112
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help.
And now we're stuck here.

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:04.450
- A whale? You know, I speak whale.
- You're insane. You can't speak whale.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.369
I have to get out. I have to find my son.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:13.125
I have to tell him
how old sea turtles are!

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.137
Hey.

01:10:27.516 --> 01:10:29.058
You okay?

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:37.358
There, there.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:40.069
It's all right. It'll be okay.

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.613
No. It won't.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.990
Sure it will. You'll see.

01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:49.662
No. I promised him I'd never
let anything happen to him.

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:55.000
That's a funny thing to promise.

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:56.085
What?

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:58.671
You can't never let anything
happen to him.

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.340
Then nothing would
ever happen to him.

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:06.178
Not much fun for little Harpo.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.316
- What's going on?
- Don't know. I'll ask him.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:24.780
- What's...
- Dory.

01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:26.323
...going

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:28.534
on?

01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:37.418
- I think he says we've stopped.
- Of course we've stopped.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:41.213
Stop trying to speak whale.
You're going to make things worse.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.048
What is that noise?

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.596
Oh, no. Look what you did.

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:53.559
The water's going down.
It's going down!

01:11:57.564 --> 01:12:00.816
- Really? You sure about that?
- Look. Already it's half-empty.

01:12:01.902 --> 01:12:04.945
- I'd say it's half-full.
- Stop that. It's half-empty!

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.743
Okay, that one was a little tougher.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.746
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.998
or he wants a root beer float.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:19.793
Of course he wants us to go there.
That's eating us!

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:22.588
How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good?

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.757
Tell him
I'm not interested in being lunch.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.259
- Okay. He's...
- Stop talking to him.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:36.727
- What is going on?
- I'll check. What...

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:39.438
No. No more whale.
You can't speak whale.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.106
Yes, I can.

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.191
No, you can't.

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:45.778
You think you can do these things,
but you can't, Nemo.

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:52.618
- Okay.
- Dory!

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:59.458
He says it's time to let go.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.835
Everything's going to be all right.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.879
How do you know?

01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:06.298
How do you know something bad
isn't going to happen?

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:08.217
I don't!

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:33.575
We're alive!

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.371
Look. Syd-ney.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.415
Sydney! Sydney.

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.000
Sydney again.

01:13:42.127 --> 01:13:44.336
You were right. We made it!

01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:47.089
We're going to find my son.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:54.179
Thank you, sir.

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.307
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:58.600
Now we find the boat that took him.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:01.478
- Right.
- Come on. We can do this!

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:19.788
Morning. It's morning, everyone.

01:14:19.873 --> 01:14:24.543
Today's the day. The sun is shining, the
tank is clean and we are getting out of...

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:26.170
The tank is clean.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.589
The tank is clean!

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:30.883
But how?

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.927
Boss must have installed it
while we were sleeping.

01:14:34.012 --> 01:14:36.513
- What are we going to do?
- What's it say, Peach?

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.641
I can't hear you, Peach.

01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:44.063
The Aqua Scum 2003 is an all-purpose,
self-cleaning salt-water purifier

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.732
that extends
the life of your aquarium fish.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:47.900
Stop it!

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:51.862
The Aqua Scum is programmed
to scan your tank every five minutes?

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.655
Scan? What does that mean?

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.747
Temperature 82 degrees,
pH balance normal.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.249
Nice.

01:15:05.794 --> 01:15:09.004
Curse you, Aqua Scum!

01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:12.424
- That's it for the escape plan.
- Then what are we going to do about...

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:14.385
Darla!

01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:16.261
Stay down, kid.

01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:21.183
- False alarm.
- My nerves can't take much more.

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:24.019
What are we going to do
when that brat gets here?

01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:26.772
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Help!

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.774
- Help me!
- Hold on. I'm coming.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.942
Help me!

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.861
Swim down! Come on, kid. Swim down!

01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:35.322
- Everybody jump in.
- Swim down!

01:15:35.407 --> 01:15:36.865
What the...

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:38.951
Good work.

01:15:39.494 --> 01:15:41.787
- Gill!
- Sharkbait!

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:46.458
- Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll!
- Go to the window.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.340
That would have been a nasty fall.

01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:56.385
- I don't want to go belly-up!
- Calm down, Nemo.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.720
You won't go belly-up. I promise.

01:15:58.805 --> 01:15:59.805
You're going to be okay.

01:16:03.977 --> 01:16:05.060
Darla!

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:12.693
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.987
No, but the boat has to be here.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:18.115
- We're going to find it.
- I'm totally excited.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:20.742
- Are you excited?
- Dory, wake up. Come on.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:22.786
Duck!

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:26.457
That's not a duck. It's a pelican!

01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:38.677
No! I didn't come this far
to be breakfast.

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.188
Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:50.272
What?

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:53.650
Sun's barely up and Gerald's
had more than he can handle.

01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:56.904
Yeah. Reckon somebody
ought to help the poor guy.

01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:01.492
Well, don't everybody fly off at once!

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.663
All right, Gerald. What is it?

01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:08.540
Fish got your tongue?

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:10.501
Love a duck!

01:17:10.877 --> 01:17:12.252
I've got to find my son Nemo.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.004
Nemo?

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:18.008
He's that fish that's been
fighting the whole ocean.

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.427
Hey, I know where your son...

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:23.805
Wait. Come back.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:26.391
- Stop!
- Keep going. He's crazy.

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:28.769
I've got something to tell you.

01:17:32.732 --> 01:17:33.774
Mine.

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:42.074
Okay. Don't make any sudden moves.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:45.702
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:49.915
Hop into your mouth?
And how does that make me live?

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:54.169
- Mine?
- Because I can take you to your son.

01:17:54.254 --> 01:17:55.587
Yeah, right!

01:17:55.672 --> 01:18:00.050
No. I know your son. He's orange.
He's got a gimpy fin on one side.

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:02.427
- That's Nemo!
- Mine! Mine! Mine!

01:18:05.265 --> 01:18:07.516
Fasten your seat belts!

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:10.811
Mine! Mine! Mine!

01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.456
Everybody hold on!

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:37.337
Mine! Mine! Mine!

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.054
Too loud. Too loud for me.

01:18:46.139 --> 01:18:48.348
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:51.184
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place!

01:18:51.936 --> 01:18:54.479
Darla, your uncle will see you now.

01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:59.151
All right. Let's see those pearly whites.

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:01.236
I'm a piranha.

01:19:01.321 --> 01:19:02.904
They're in the Amazon.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:06.491
And a piranha's a fish.
Just like your present.

01:19:08.328 --> 01:19:09.911
- I got a fishy!
- Oh, no.

01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:12.456
Poor little guy.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.374
- He's dead.
- Sharkbait!

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:16.126
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:20.047
Must have left your present
in the car, sweetie. I'll go and get it.

01:19:20.131 --> 01:19:21.632
He's still alive!

01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:23.383
Why is he playing dead?

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:25.218
He's going to
get flushed down the toilet.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:27.763
He's going to get out of here.

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:31.767
- What a smart little guy.
- No, not the trash can!

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:35.062
Hey! I found his dad.

01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:36.730
- Where's Nemo?
- Dentist!

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:38.523
- He's over there.
- What's a dentist?

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:42.194
- Get in there.
- I can't go in there.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.697
Oh, yes you can. Charge!

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.533
What the...

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.496
Darla, sweetie, look out.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.127
Hold still. Easy, easy.

01:20:00.672 --> 01:20:02.005
Hold still!

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.882
It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:13.975
Nemo.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:16.061
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gotcha!

01:20:17.438 --> 01:20:19.606
- Nemo!
- Daddy?

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:23.068
Out with you. And stay out!

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:26.405
- Daddy?
- Fishy?

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.323
Fishy!

01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:30.117
Wake up! Wake up!

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.660
- Oh, no!
- To the top

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.328
of Mount Wannahockaloogie.

01:20:33.413 --> 01:20:35.706
Why are you sleeping?

01:20:35.957 --> 01:20:38.166
- Hurry!
- Bloat!

01:20:41.379 --> 01:20:43.255
Ring of Fire!

01:20:45.258 --> 01:20:46.591
Fishy!

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:50.512
- Get it out!
- Crikey!

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.264
The animals have gone mad!

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:56.351
Get it out!

01:20:56.436 --> 01:20:58.395
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:00.439
There's a fish in my hair!

01:21:01.274 --> 01:21:03.275
- Gill.
- Sharkbait.

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:06.236
Tell your dad I said hi.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.034
Go get him.

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:19.416
He did it!

01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:22.377
- I'm happy.
- Is he going to be okay?

01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:25.255
Don't worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:26.798
Fishy!

01:21:34.766 --> 01:21:36.308
Daddy!

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.721
I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:17.974
Truly I am.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.619
- Hey...
- Dory.

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:42.707
If it wasn't for you,
I never would have even made it here.

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:45.085
So thank you.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:48.797
Hey, wait a minute.

01:22:49.215 --> 01:22:51.633
Wait. Where are you going?

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:54.594
It's over, Dory. We were too late.

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:58.098
Nemo's gone.

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.100
I'm going home now.

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.269
No. No, you can't.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:05.397
Stop!

01:23:08.359 --> 01:23:10.610
Please don't go away. Please?

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:14.072
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.992
And if you leave...

01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:20.579
I remember things better with you.
Look.

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:22.914
P. Sherman, 42...

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.667
42...

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:29.379
I remember it. It's there. I know it is.

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:32.048
Because when I look at you, I can feel it.

01:23:32.133 --> 01:23:34.467
And I look at you and I...

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:37.554
I'm home.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.435
Please. I don't want that to go away.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.438
I don't want to forget.

01:23:47.982 --> 01:23:50.025
I'm sorry, Dory,

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.610
but I do.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:06.833
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life.

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.085
Hey!

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:12.130
- This is our spot.
- Go on. Get out of here.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:15.967
Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:17.719
Yeah, that's it.

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.639
Too right, mate!

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.349
I got a live one here!

01:24:22.433 --> 01:24:24.893
- Have you seen my dad?
- Gotcha!

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:27.562
- Come back here.
- You let him go!

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.316
Dad!

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:33.735
Dad!

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:35.987
Dad!

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:37.405
No!

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:52.462
- Excuse me.
- No.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.965
- Are you all right?
- I don't know where I am.

01:24:55.049 --> 01:24:57.467
I don't know what's going on.
I think I lost somebody,

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.260
but I can't remember.

01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:01.763
- It's okay.
- I can't remember.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:05.475
I'm looking for someone, too.
We can look together.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.979
- I'm Dory.
- I'm Nemo.

01:25:09.063 --> 01:25:10.522
Nemo?

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:12.440
That's a nice name.

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.576
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:25.245
- Dad.
- Dad.

01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:26.913
Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad?

01:25:26.998 --> 01:25:28.123
My dad.

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:30.125
- Got it. Dad!
- Where are we anyway?

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:31.418
Dad!

01:25:32.253 --> 01:25:34.587
Syl... Schai...

01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:36.089
Sydney.

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:38.758
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

01:25:40.553 --> 01:25:41.970
- Nemo!
- What?

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:43.680
It's you! Nemo!

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:45.390
Yes. I'm Nemo.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:48.226
You're Nemo.
You were dead. I saw you.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:50.645
And then... Here you are.
You're not dead.

01:25:50.730 --> 01:25:53.148
And your father... Your father!

01:25:53.232 --> 01:25:56.151
My father? You know my father?
Where is he?

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:57.986
He went this way. Quick!

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:00.655
Hey!

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.741
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:04.826
- It looks like him.
- But bigger.

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.620
I saw him,
but I'm not telling you where he went.

01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:11.166
And there's no way
you're going to make me.

01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:14.878
Mine.

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:17.297
All right. I'll talk!

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.924
He went to the fishing grounds.

01:26:24.889 --> 01:26:26.556
- Hey, look out.
- Sorry.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.433
I'm just trying to get home.

01:26:31.771 --> 01:26:33.188
Daddy!

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:36.024
- Nemo?
- Daddy!

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:37.192
Nemo?

01:26:37.276 --> 01:26:39.110
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

01:26:39.195 --> 01:26:40.445
Dory?

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:42.322
- Nemo!
- Daddy!

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:45.784
- Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!
- Dad!

01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:48.411
Nemo! Thank goodness.

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:51.331
It's all right, son. It's going to be okay.

01:26:51.749 --> 01:26:54.125
Turn around!
You're going the wrong way.

01:26:57.630 --> 01:26:59.756
- Look out!
- Move!

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.654
- Dory!
- Come on.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.407
Help! Get us out!

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.494
No, no, no! Dory!

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.746
- Dad, I know what to do.
- Nemo, no!

01:27:31.831 --> 01:27:34.582
We have to tell all the fish
to swim down together.

01:27:34.667 --> 01:27:36.918
- Get out of there.
- This will work.

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:39.295
No, I am not going to lose you again.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:42.757
There's no time.
It's the only way we can save Dory.

01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:45.510
I can do this!

01:27:47.304 --> 01:27:50.682
You're right. I know you can.

01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:54.102
- Lucky fin.
- Now, go. Hurry!

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.479
Tell all the fish to swim down.

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:59.858
Well, you heard my son. Come on.

01:28:01.694 --> 01:28:05.947
- Dory, you have to tell everybody to...
- Swim down together.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.241
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.118
Swim down!

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:18.293
- Everybody swim down.
- Come on. You have to swim down.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:21.045
Down! Swim down!

01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:26.759
Swim down! Swim down!

01:28:34.727 --> 01:28:36.936
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:39.898
Just keep swimming!

01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:45.236
That's it!

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.158
It's working!

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:56.122
Keep swimming!

01:28:56.207 --> 01:28:58.750
Just keep swimming!

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:01.044
- Come on, Dad!
- You're doing great, son.

01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:03.463
- That's my dad.
- Let's get to the bottom.

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:06.758
Just keep swimming

01:29:06.842 --> 01:29:08.968
Almost there. Keep swimming!

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:13.848
Keep swimming!

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.310
Keep swimming!

01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:29.864
Hey!

01:29:29.949 --> 01:29:31.449
Where's Nemo?

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:32.909
There!

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.455
Oh, no. Nemo!

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:45.630
Nemo?

01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:48.383
Nemo?

01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:53.137
It's okay. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

01:29:58.435 --> 01:30:00.812
- Daddy?
- Oh, thank goodness.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.647
Daddy...

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.483
- I don't hate you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:08.987
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

01:30:18.539 --> 01:30:20.748
Hey, guess what?

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:23.209
- What?
- Sea turtles...

01:30:23.294 --> 01:30:25.169
I met one.

01:30:25.254 --> 01:30:29.048
And he was 150 years old.

01:30:29.133 --> 01:30:31.092
150?

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:32.677
Yep.

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:37.432
'Cause Sandy Plankton said
they only lived to be 100.

01:30:38.392 --> 01:30:39.851
Sandy Plankton?

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:43.771
Think I would cross the ocean and
not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

01:30:43.856 --> 01:30:46.607
He was 150! Not 100.

01:30:46.692 --> 01:30:50.028
Who is this Sandy Plankton
that knows everything wrong?

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.700
Time for school! Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.495
- I'm going to win.
- No, you're not.

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:03.124
- I did it.
- My own son beats me.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:05.251
Climb aboard, explorers.

01:31:05.336 --> 01:31:08.629
So then the sea cucumber looks over
at the mollusk and says,

01:31:08.714 --> 01:31:11.215
"With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?"

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:15.261
Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?

01:31:15.346 --> 01:31:18.681
- Exchange student.
- I'm from the EAC, dude.

01:31:18.766 --> 01:31:21.059
- Sweet.
- Totally.

01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:25.688
Seriously, Marty, did you really do
all the things you say you did?

01:31:25.773 --> 01:31:27.065
Pardon me.

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:29.025
Hello.

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:32.111
Don't be alarmed.

01:31:32.196 --> 01:31:35.323
We wanted to make sure
our newest member got home safely.

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:37.492
- Thanks.
- We'll see you next week.

01:31:37.576 --> 01:31:41.120
- Keep up with the programme, Dory.
- Remember, fish are friends.

01:31:41.205 --> 01:31:43.539
Not food! Bye!

01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:45.500
Hold on. Here we go.

01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:47.293
Next stop, knowledge.

01:31:47.378 --> 01:31:49.837
Bye, son. Have fun.

01:31:49.922 --> 01:31:51.047
Bye, Dad.

01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:54.425
Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something.

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:01.265
Love you, Dad.

01:32:02.476 --> 01:32:04.477
I love you, too, son.

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:09.690
Dad? You can let go now.

01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:11.109
Sorry.

01:32:11.193 --> 01:32:13.319
Now go have an adventure.

01:32:13.404 --> 01:32:15.696
Goodbye. See you later, dudes!

01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:17.532
- Bye, Elmo.
- Nemo.

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:21.119
- Nemo. Bye, Nemo.
- See you after school, Dory.

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:23.287
Bye, Dad!

01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:26.290
Bye, son.

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:45.393
Barbara.

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:46.936
I don't understand it.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:50.314
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee
and it breaks.

01:32:50.399 --> 01:32:54.986
Had to clean the tank myself,
take the fish out, put 'em in bags and...

01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:57.321
Where'd the fish go?

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:05.079
Come on, Peach!

01:33:05.164 --> 01:33:07.623
You got it. That's it. You can do it.

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:09.959
That's the shortest red light
I've ever seen.

01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:11.794
Come on, Peach.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:29.680
Now what?
