WEBVTT

00:25.734 --> 00:27.277
See if it fits.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.670
I will turn down both of these.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.631
Please divorce me.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.135
I received the rest of the money
from your dad.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.433
My dad?

00:59.809 --> 01:00.977
Yes.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.189
I went to him and asked for it.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.733
I heard that

01:07.942 --> 01:09.235
you couldn't get the money yourself.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.197
I'm sorry

01:13.114 --> 01:14.783
the surgery fell through.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.452
-Hye-su.
-I'm sorry.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.663
I was never...

01:22.248 --> 01:24.042
romantically attracted to you.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.630
I think we should each go back
to where we belong.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.426
That's absurd.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.179
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:36.429 --> 01:38.056
We got caught up in our roles.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.434
I think there was a mistake.

01:41.851 --> 01:44.604
-Hye-su.
-That night was definitely a mistake.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.273
Please forget about it.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.983
Do you mean it?

01:50.568 --> 01:51.736
Yes.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.409
Let me ask you again.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.705
Do you mean it?

02:06.292 --> 02:07.460
Yes.

02:09.754 --> 02:10.922
I mean it.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.722
When should we go to court?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.395
Let me know after you set a date.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.565
I'll get the documents ready.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.196
I'll get going now.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.365
Let's eat together another time.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.138
Something happened, right?

03:00.930 --> 03:02.348
Did my dad say something?

03:03.516 --> 03:05.393
This has got nothing to do with him.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.271
You said the contract is over.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.648
So I received

03:11.065 --> 03:12.567
the amount I was due.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.445
You were too into your role,

03:16.154 --> 03:18.114
so you were confused too.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.617
Let me make myself clear.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.452
I have

03:23.161 --> 03:24.746
no intention

03:25.997 --> 03:27.373
of dating you.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.167
I'll get going then.

04:36.859 --> 04:37.902
Dad.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.365
Did you give Hye-su money?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.245
Do you still not get it?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.957
My goodness.
I can't believe you're so naive.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.377
Remember that bet we made?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.170
I won.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.798
She has quite a character.

04:59.674 --> 05:03.052
She came to me
and shamelessly dared to ask for money.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.722
She even threatened to not divorce you

05:06.222 --> 05:07.473
if I didn't pay her.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.892
What an unbelievable girl.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.603
Honestly, I was shocked too.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.064
I did expect that from her,

05:15.732 --> 05:17.358
but not to that extreme.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.737
If you've come to your senses,
go back to where you belong.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.698
Your mom and that girl

05:24.115 --> 05:26.242
add nothing to your life.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.870
Don't waste your time on them.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.289
You're destined for great things.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.999
Don't forget that.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.252
-Dad.
-How did it feel to not have any money?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.504
I bet you were sweating bullets.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.966
I trust that you've now realized
where you stand

05:42.383 --> 05:43.968
and where you belong.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.304
Come to your senses.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.515
Once the divorce is finalized,
marry Na-yoon.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.019
Do you know how hard it was
to convince her parents?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.898
The families are meeting this weekend.

05:57.940 --> 06:00.068
Go and apologize sincerely.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.487
I'm going to see Mom this weekend.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.906
Please reconsider this meeting.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.199
What?

06:06.574 --> 06:08.159
Mom doesn't have much time left.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.453
Come to think of it,

06:11.412 --> 06:13.122
I think we should do
at least that much for her.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.965
That punk.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.431
Did you catch a cold?

06:31.766 --> 06:32.934
Yes.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.061
What's gotten into you?

06:36.062 --> 06:39.107
You never take medication for colds.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.528
Are you okay?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.488
Yes.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.576
Did you

06:50.701 --> 06:51.869
get the money?

06:52.995 --> 06:54.038
Yes,

06:54.413 --> 06:55.581
I did.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.416
You did?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.212
Hey,

07:01.629 --> 07:04.048
you should take me out to celebrate, then.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.466
What are we doing here?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.801
Let's go out tomorrow.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.012
Let's have Korean beef. Korean beef.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.431
All right.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.974
I'll treat you to Korean beef.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.521
When are you going to
open your snack shop?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.481
What?

07:20.731 --> 07:21.983
How about if

07:22.733 --> 07:24.110
we open one together?

07:26.571 --> 07:27.905
I don't know.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.198
To be honest,

07:30.408 --> 07:32.160
I'm sick of this nail salon.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.203
I only end up with neck pain.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.165
I want to run a restaurant with you.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.750
You can cook,
and I'll be the face of the restaurant.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.003
What do you think?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.422
Let's not rush into it.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.300
We can think about it slowly.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.721
What is there to think about?

07:51.846 --> 07:54.724
Let's go and look at possible spots
tomorrow. Yes?

07:57.602 --> 08:00.980
I was a bit shocked this time, though.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.649
I thought that

08:05.193 --> 08:06.903
you would've refused the money,

08:07.820 --> 08:10.781
since you didn't get the surgery.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.203
Or at least, I expected you to take
only half or something.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.708
I mean, I'm not saying
you did anything wrong.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.420
You did the right thing.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.673
Definitely. You were very smart.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.301
Anyway, let's go and look at possible
spots for our shop tomorrow.

08:30.384 --> 08:31.969
Okay? Yes?

08:32.637 --> 08:33.804
Ju-yeon,

08:34.805 --> 08:37.683
I'm not going to
use that money for a while.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.477
Move.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.153
Gosh, you make it sound like you've
withdrawn your savings or something.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.240
Let me help you.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.075
Let go.

09:37.493 --> 09:38.828
I told you to stop being stubborn

09:39.078 --> 09:41.038
and go and get your surgery.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.457
I canceled it.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.875
How many times do I have to tell you?

09:46.961 --> 09:49.088
Here, let me help.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.090
I'm a professional at fixing nets.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.925
Gosh, get out of my way.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.719
Isn't that Gap-sun?

09:54.802 --> 09:55.970
I think it is.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.180
Jin-man, just let it go.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.398
Are you Ms. Oh Mi-ran's brother?

10:08.816 --> 10:09.984
Who are you?

10:12.862 --> 10:14.030
What is this?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.282
It's from Ms. Han.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.742
Gosh.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.078
-Goodness.
-There's an important project coming up,

10:21.162 --> 10:23.372
but Mr. Han seems distracted

10:23.456 --> 10:25.124
and can't seem to focus on anything.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.336
Please take Ms. Oh Mi-ran away from here.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.462
What?

10:29.712 --> 10:32.548
I'm sure this will be
a satisfactory amount.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.300
He said to add it to your retirement fund.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.468
So what is he saying?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.387
She should stop getting in her son's way

10:38.638 --> 10:40.765
and go far, far away?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.851
It would be better for everyone
if she goes somewhere nicer.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.896
Don't give me that nonsense.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.274
Of course Ji-hun is upset.
His mom is dying!

10:50.858 --> 10:52.735
Is that man a lunatic?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.071
Please calm down.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.238
Why you...

10:56.322 --> 10:57.990
-Jin-man, stop!
-Do you want to drown?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.785
Stop it, Jin-man! Stop it!

11:00.868 --> 11:01.994
Calm down!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.913
You fool.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.999
What did you see in that jerk

11:07.083 --> 11:08.709
that you abandoned your entire family for?

11:09.335 --> 11:11.629
He wants you to get lost and die alone.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.339
That's not it.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.882
Get out of my face!

11:14.965 --> 11:17.176
-I'll throw you in the ocean!
-Don't.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.888
I want you to leave too.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.723
I can't stand the sight of you.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.315
You can't back off
just because he got angry.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.608
I'm sorry, sir.

11:32.691 --> 11:35.152
Fine. Get back to the office.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.570
Yes, sir.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.374
What is it?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.836
You have a guest, sir.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.337
Na-yoon.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.672
Come in.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.260
Sorry for everything
you had to go through.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.221
It's all over now, so let it go.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.309
He must feel humiliated right now.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.061
He was used by her.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.898
Go and console him.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.942
What do you mean?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.819
Please tell me in detail.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.578
You're going to open
the snack shop anyway.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.247
What's the point in waiting?

12:28.622 --> 12:31.417
It's better to open it sooner
rather than later.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.670
No? The real estate broker nearby said

12:34.753 --> 12:36.505
that he'll show us a few places.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.300
Let's take a look. Please?

12:40.718 --> 12:41.719
Later.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.928
Gosh.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.599
You should put your plan into action.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.268
You'll end up using up all that money
little by little.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.478
You'll use up all of it.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.604
Ju-yeon,

12:51.937 --> 12:53.272
I'm going to put that money

12:53.522 --> 12:57.318
into an account for child support
until Eun-seong grows up.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.616
You're talking like a real divorcee
who got her settlement check.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.743
What do you mean by child support?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.329
You can make money to spend on her,

13:08.412 --> 13:10.748
and you need the snack shop
to make the money.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.666
Gosh, come on, Hye-su.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.002
Why are you being so hesitant?

13:16.962 --> 13:18.506
I could die.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.175
You never know.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.556
If you don't want to do it, just say so.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.643
What kind of excuse is that?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.145
Come on.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.731
You're the one who's always talked
about opening a snack shop.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.942
Is it because
I want you to run it with me?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.693
You're worried I'll take your money?

13:39.818 --> 13:40.903
-Hey.
-What?

13:41.403 --> 13:43.948
Don't worry. I'm not that shameless.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.410
Knowing you,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.164
you probably felt worse,

13:52.456 --> 13:54.875
taking the money even though
you didn't get the surgery.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.422
Ju-yeon.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.720
I know how you feel.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.722
I understand.

14:10.849 --> 14:11.934
So let's

14:12.810 --> 14:15.396
open a snack shop soon
and forget all about it.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.481
It won't be someone else's money then.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.857
Please?

14:22.486 --> 14:23.654
Thank you.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.659
But I can't go looking around

14:30.244 --> 14:31.704
for possible shop spots right now.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.790
Why not?

14:50.264 --> 14:51.765
Promise me

14:53.392 --> 14:55.936
that you'll only say good
and positive things.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.856
Tell me that everything will be okay.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.734
Just tell me that.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.110
Gosh.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.405
I won't die.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.659
I'll live even if it kills me.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.579
So promise me first

15:15.706 --> 15:17.374
that you'll only say good things.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.961
Then,

15:22.713 --> 15:24.256
I'll tell you everything.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.133
Come on.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.469
What is it?

15:36.518 --> 15:37.853
You little...

16:20.646 --> 16:21.939
You have a guest.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.315
She's over there.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.367
What is it?

16:34.368 --> 16:35.536
Have a seat.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.288
If it's going to be long,
let's talk another time.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.289
I'm tired.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.251
I never liked that woman from the start.

16:43.752 --> 16:47.339
Are you sure she didn't get the kitchen
job intentionally from the start?

16:56.807 --> 16:59.143
Normal people wouldn't agree to

16:59.768 --> 17:01.979
that kind of offer.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.816
I should've known she wasn't
your average person.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.526
I was the one who made that offer.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.196
It's because I'm not normal,
and not your average person.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.448
That's not what I mean.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.991
Don't judge people.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.660
How normal and average are you?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.495
I'm here to comfort you.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.748
At least try to be
considerate of my feelings.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.083
I don't need any comforting.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.960
I understand how you feel,

17:25.377 --> 17:26.670
but you're out of line.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.590
I heard she went to your dad
and even threatened him for money.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.550
How can you still defend her?

17:33.677 --> 17:35.054
-Hey.
-What?

17:35.679 --> 17:36.764
What are you doing?

17:36.847 --> 17:37.890
Nothing.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.897
Sorry for the wait.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.815
I'm leaving. Enjoy your tea.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.542
Let's go.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.794
Kang Hye-su.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.218
How could you come back here?

18:14.468 --> 18:15.761
How can you be so rude?

18:17.805 --> 18:20.265
Eun-seong, go up first, okay?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.391
Okay.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.520
Be careful.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.817
Do you actually intend
to keep on working here?

18:30.234 --> 18:31.401
I'll be quitting soon.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.403
Don't worry.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.008
Chubby, Blackie, and Cutie,
how have you been?

18:55.509 --> 18:57.219
Mister fed you guys.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.221
Blackie and Cutie,

18:59.304 --> 19:00.681
where's Chubby?

19:02.516 --> 19:04.560
There he is.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.487
Eun-seong.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.239
-Eun-seong.
-Mister!

19:17.656 --> 19:20.492
How have you been, Eun-seong?

19:24.288 --> 19:25.706
You're adorable.

19:25.789 --> 19:28.542
-Didn't you miss me?
-I missed you.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.128
I missed you too.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.673
I know it's not my place to get involved,

19:35.966 --> 19:38.385
but did you and Ji-hun have a fling...

19:41.054 --> 19:42.681
Anyway,

19:42.931 --> 19:45.392
he was freaking out
about getting the money for you.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.144
He even borrowed money from me.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.479
He put his car up as collateral
and sold his watch.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.733
Gosh, I've never seen him like that.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.696
I heard you refused his money, though.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.283
Thank you.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.579
It doesn't make any sense to accept it

20:05.662 --> 20:07.122
even if you did have a contract.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.874
Right?

20:13.587 --> 20:17.507
But must you really quit your job here?

20:18.634 --> 20:19.676
Yes.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.138
What do you plan to do after you quit?

20:23.847 --> 20:25.307
Quit? Who's quitting?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.268
You?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.272
Why are you back so soon
after being dispatched?

20:32.522 --> 20:33.690
Did you come to quit?

20:34.316 --> 20:37.027
Yes. Due to personal circumstances.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.487
Whatever.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.947
Stop your nonsense.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.491
How can you be so irresponsible?

20:42.866 --> 20:44.451
You can't quit this soon.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.996
Did you forget how thing are right now?
We don't have a single decent worker here.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.999
-I--
-What "eye"?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.376
Eyeball?

20:53.627 --> 20:55.629
That isn't funny, Chef.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.006
I understand.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.009
I'll stay until someone can take over.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.011
I'm sorry, Chef.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.517
Eun-seong.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.477
Where are you?

21:10.769 --> 21:11.937
Eun-seong...

21:15.440 --> 21:16.608
Eun-seong.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.319
-Get out of there.
-Let's have some ice cream.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.657
Come down from there. Now.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.993
Come down. You can't do that.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.411
Eun-seong.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.037
Eun-seong.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.708
-Come here.
-Mom, let's play here.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.836
He has so many cool things in his room.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.838
You can't play in here.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.631
-This is his workplace.
-No.

21:39.715 --> 21:43.051
Our home is no fun.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.388
-Our home is no fun.
-My goodness.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.976
I don't want to go home.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.227
Hold on.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.982
-Let's go.
-Why?

21:57.941 --> 21:58.942
Stay here.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.206
Eun-seong, come here.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.048
My ice cream is melting.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.507
My ice cream.

22:25.802 --> 22:27.387
I'll buy you ice cream.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.889
No.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.891
I want the ice-cream Mister got for me.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.560
Eun-seong,

22:33.977 --> 22:35.479
listen to me.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.272
We're going to move out.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.026
-Why?
-We'll go somewhere much nicer.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.489
Aren't you going to marry Mister?

22:47.282 --> 22:48.325
No,

22:48.867 --> 22:50.035
I'm not marrying him.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.411
Why not?

22:53.830 --> 22:55.082
I want

22:55.874 --> 22:57.793
to live with just you.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.923
No. I want to live with Mister.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.345
Eun-seong,

23:09.137 --> 23:10.347
stop whining.

23:10.722 --> 23:11.932
How old are you?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.892
You said you're not a baby.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.852
You said you're a big girl.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.313
A big girl shouldn't whine.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.108
I told you not to fight with him.

23:22.734 --> 23:26.238
I told you to get along with him.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.617
I have a question.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.842
I'll ask you one more time.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.096
Did I really...

24:36.141 --> 24:38.018
mean nothing to you?

24:38.393 --> 24:39.936
I think I answered that question already.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.313
Do you think

24:42.355 --> 24:44.482
I'm too stupid to tell the difference
between a mistake

24:46.693 --> 24:48.069
and how you truly feel?

24:52.908 --> 24:55.452
Why are you so hung up on that?

24:57.037 --> 24:58.580
Was that your first kiss?

25:00.123 --> 25:01.458
You'll make me uncomfortable

25:02.042 --> 25:03.335
if you keep this up.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.297
When should we go to court?

25:07.756 --> 25:09.049
Please set a date.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.259
The sooner the better.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.453
Hello?

25:38.536 --> 25:41.248
Your dad is a despicable human being.

25:42.165 --> 25:44.834
-Pardon?
-He isn't fit to be human.

25:46.127 --> 25:48.713
Even if your mom may have been a nuisance,

25:49.631 --> 25:51.049
how could he do that?

25:53.969 --> 25:55.178
Did something happen?

25:55.553 --> 25:57.055
Tell your dad

25:57.806 --> 26:00.141
that he will be punished greatly
if he continues to live like that.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.936
Gosh!

26:24.958 --> 26:26.251
You're good.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.254
So, did you look into it?

26:29.587 --> 26:31.172
Is there anything interesting?

26:31.673 --> 26:32.841
The thing is,

26:33.550 --> 26:36.636
there was no major law violation.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.805
He was caught on camera twice
for speeding.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.390
He paid the fine, and that's all.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.725
That can't be!

26:41.891 --> 26:43.852
That punk isn't clean at all!

26:43.935 --> 26:45.729
Who are you talking about?

26:45.812 --> 26:46.980
Stay out of it.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.816
Did you look into things
like tax evasion and corruption?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.193
I did. There were no issues.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.905
What about his issues with women?

26:56.072 --> 26:57.324
I'm sure there was something.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.533
Well...

26:59.117 --> 27:01.161
Get out. Go.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.005
Mr. Han is not married, correct?

27:12.130 --> 27:13.923
Of course he's not married.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.301
But it turns out he is.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.805
While preparing the documents,

27:22.182 --> 27:23.350
I got his family registry.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.185
What are you talking about?

27:28.855 --> 27:31.900
SPOUSE: KANG HYE-SU
CHILDREN: HAN EUN-SEONG

27:36.029 --> 27:37.113
Dad!

27:37.197 --> 27:38.365
-Dad.
-What's wrong with you?

27:38.448 --> 27:41.618
Mom, you too. Come sit.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.704
Dad, did you know?

27:45.038 --> 27:46.081
Know what?

27:46.164 --> 27:50.126
Ji-hun, that kid, is incredibly naive.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.295
What do you mean?

27:52.379 --> 27:54.839
I'd only heard about such things.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.758
For example, that some people
will just register

27:56.841 --> 27:59.302
their marriage first
if their parents disapprove.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.639
That takes a lot of courage,
in my opinion.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.975
Why are you talking about something
that's so out of the blue?

28:06.267 --> 28:09.145
Honestly, I thought about this
all day long,

28:09.312 --> 28:12.482
wondering whether
or not I should tell you.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.818
I mean, you have high blood pressure too.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.820
What is it? Spit it out.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.615
It turns out that Ji-hun
is legally married.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.283
What?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.661
You know that employee at the restaurant?

28:24.744 --> 28:26.621
That fake girlfriend.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.248
My goodness.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.837
They must really be in love.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.131
What will you do now, Dad?

28:36.589 --> 28:38.341
What about Na-yoon?

28:38.425 --> 28:40.009
-You punk.
-Honey.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.930
Did you run a background check
on your brother?

28:44.013 --> 28:45.432
Well, that was--

28:45.515 --> 28:48.685
Why did you do that?
Who told you to such a thing?

28:49.436 --> 28:50.603
Did you know about this already?

28:51.020 --> 28:52.272
What's going on?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.523
You loser.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.151
How can you be so pathetic at everything?

28:56.234 --> 28:57.152
Honey.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.028
If word gets out about this,

28:59.112 --> 29:01.531
you are no longer my son. Remember that!

29:01.990 --> 29:02.949
Gosh.

29:04.784 --> 29:05.869
Darn it!

29:09.289 --> 29:10.540
HANNAM FOOD

29:10.665 --> 29:12.167
Good work, everyone.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.878
You stay behind.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.259
When are you going to go to court?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.262
Why are you dragging this out?

29:26.806 --> 29:27.974
We'll go soon.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.894
I don't believe a word you say anymore.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.687
When is "soon"?

29:34.272 --> 29:35.356
Don't worry.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.358
We'll get a divorce.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.114
Dad.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.534
I want to ask you something.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.538
What do my mom and I

29:51.706 --> 29:53.416
mean to you?

29:55.835 --> 29:58.379
What do we mean to you in your life?

29:58.838 --> 30:00.465
What do you both mean to me?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.718
You don't have the time to be
asking such things.

30:04.719 --> 30:07.639
Do you know how many popular restaurants
have gone out of business overnight?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.724
You said your goal was to be
the best in the industry.

30:09.891 --> 30:12.393
Sales have stagnated this month.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.729
Explain that first.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.359
This is all because you were distracted.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.903
The world is a competitive place.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.364
Do you need to lose your funding again

30:24.864 --> 30:26.157
to get your head straight?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.252
That's enough.

30:37.710 --> 30:40.004
I heard the Chairman's second son had

30:40.338 --> 30:42.340
a lot of issues with women,

30:42.465 --> 30:44.133
and got into a huge mess this time.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.345
Apparently a female employee
at his restaurant set out to use him.

30:47.428 --> 30:50.557
He didn't even realize,
so he had to pay her out big in the end.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.600
-Is that true?
-Yes.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.185
Both sons are ridiculous.

30:54.352 --> 30:57.021
-What is wrong with that family?
-Gosh.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.774
They'll split it all up among themselves
in the end anyway.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.068
Of course. What else can you expect
from those rich people?

31:23.214 --> 31:27.010
I'M SORRY, MS. OH

31:27.802 --> 31:29.512
-Is that true?
-It is.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.015
I didn't know that lady was that bad,

31:32.140 --> 31:33.850
but she must have slept with Mr. Han.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.019
-Oh my gosh. I can't believe it.
-Right?

31:36.269 --> 31:38.771
-Gosh.
-No wonder. I thought something was up.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.197
-What was that?
-What?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.659
Is it true what they're saying
about Hye-su?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.494
Stop with the whispering!

31:55.371 --> 31:57.415
-Mr. Han.
-Chef Gong.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.542
-Chef Gong Su-chang.
-Yes, Mr. Han.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.252
When is the new menu coming out?

32:01.544 --> 32:03.880
-The new menu?
-Sales are stagnant this month.

32:04.505 --> 32:06.341
Get me a list by the end of the day.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.800
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.056
Hey, Shin Gyeong-min.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.391
-Yes?
-Clean the kitchen properly.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.935
I ought to...

32:21.731 --> 32:22.774
Kang Hye-su!

32:22.857 --> 32:23.900
Yes.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.652
Get to work!

32:29.030 --> 32:30.239
Tell me the truth.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.659
-Sorry?
-What's going on with you and Mr. Han?

32:33.326 --> 32:35.745
Did you really date him, get dumped,
and threaten him for money?

32:36.329 --> 32:38.706
-Sorry?
-I'll give you three seconds to respond.

32:38.831 --> 32:39.874
Three.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.793
It isn't true, right?

32:42.293 --> 32:44.337
I knew it. These jerks.

32:44.545 --> 32:45.630
You jerks!

32:46.255 --> 32:48.216
-How could you say that about her?
-Chef.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.634
-How dare you?
-Chef.

32:49.717 --> 32:50.885
You jerks.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.606
Why are you so hung up on that?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.650
Was that your first kiss?

33:10.530 --> 33:13.282
Don't talk
about another person's life like that.

33:13.366 --> 33:17.787
Rock bottom
is what they call people like you!

33:18.329 --> 33:19.539
Ji-hun is not cold.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.833
Ji-hun may act cold,

33:22.458 --> 33:24.585
but he's warm and kind on the inside.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.963
It's not easy to be so brave.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.299
You sacrificed yourself

33:31.134 --> 33:32.552
to save someone else's life.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.097
That isn't something

33:36.723 --> 33:38.558
anyone can do.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.605
See? You are bleeding.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.358
Stay still.

35:16.906 --> 35:19.367
Did you come here to sleep all day?

35:20.326 --> 35:21.494
Come outside.

35:22.328 --> 35:23.538
Let's have dinner.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.211
Are you asleep?

35:37.718 --> 35:38.761
Gap-sun.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.681
Gap-sun, wake up.

35:41.848 --> 35:42.890
Gap-sun.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.687
Oh no. Gap-sun.

35:47.770 --> 35:48.980
Oh no.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.440
Gap-sun, wake up.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.067
Gap-sun!

35:53.693 --> 35:57.738
AMBULANCE

35:57.864 --> 36:01.242
Ms. Oh from Samseong-dong was brought
to Seoul in a critical condition.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.081
Let's go.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.709
It looks like
I'll have to get involved myself.

36:30.938 --> 36:31.981
Hello.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.740
Oh, yes.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.910
I wondered who it was.

36:44.744 --> 36:45.995
It's been a while.

36:50.082 --> 36:51.626
How is she?

36:52.376 --> 36:55.504
Do you think you have any right
to ask me that?

36:57.423 --> 37:00.134
You're still rough around the edges.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.764
So is she unconscious?

37:05.181 --> 37:07.808
I wanted to visit, but I guess not.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.310
Why?

37:09.810 --> 37:11.604
What do you want to say to her?

37:11.979 --> 37:14.482
Today might be her last, so I should

37:14.899 --> 37:16.275
at least say farewell.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.612
By the way,

37:19.695 --> 37:22.448
I have something I want to tell you.

37:22.823 --> 37:26.369
If you considered a transplant,

37:26.827 --> 37:28.329
please don't.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.541
No one in our family can help her now.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.714
This isn't much, but use it

37:39.674 --> 37:41.092
for her funeral.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.764
You jerk.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.766
Are you okay, sir?

37:48.849 --> 37:50.559
I want to

37:51.018 --> 37:53.229
kill you right now,

37:54.230 --> 37:56.148
but I don't want to dirty my hands,

37:56.232 --> 37:57.900
so I'll stop here.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.986
You jerk.

38:00.486 --> 38:03.364
You ruined my sister's life.
Wasn't that enough?

38:03.572 --> 38:06.450
Did you have to come
to make sure she dies?

38:07.076 --> 38:09.704
You rotten bastard!

38:10.329 --> 38:11.664
Get off me!

38:13.499 --> 38:14.667
Fine.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.254
Sure. Live a good life.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.467
Make lots of money,
and stuff yourself with it.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.512
Enjoy being called "Chairman",
and have a good life.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.847
Okay?

38:28.347 --> 38:29.515
I'm going to

38:30.057 --> 38:31.434
save my sister myself.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.811
I don't need a single dime

38:34.312 --> 38:35.771
from your family.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.565
You jerk.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.652
Chairman, are you all right?

38:53.247 --> 38:54.665
I will give you a discount. Take a look.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.542
-I'll come back next time.
-You should take a look.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.668
Hey.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.962
What are you doing here at this hour?

39:00.046 --> 39:01.839
Mother, why are you eating here? Come on.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.591
What are you doing? Give that back.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.760
I brought you some dumplings.
Eat them, too.

39:07.887 --> 39:11.182
-Here.
-Hye-su, why are you here?

39:11.265 --> 39:12.808
Your boyfriend won't like it

39:12.892 --> 39:15.019
if you meet your old mother-in-law.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.145
Hurry and go.

39:16.228 --> 39:17.271
Hey.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.190
We broke up.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.609
Why?

39:22.902 --> 39:25.571
We didn't get along well.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.114
What do you mean?

39:27.907 --> 39:29.950
Is it because of Eun-seong?

39:30.034 --> 39:31.327
No.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.120
It was just

39:33.412 --> 39:34.872
differences in personality.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.999
That punk.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.085
He looked like he had a temper.

39:39.710 --> 39:40.878
I was right.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.880
Goodness.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.387
Don't be too upset.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.389
If it wasn't meant to be, so be it.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.766
-Mother.
-Yes?

39:54.809 --> 39:58.020
I may have a favor to ask you
in the future.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.940
I think I'll become very busy.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.859
Can you watch Eun-seong for me
every now and then?

40:04.110 --> 40:06.654
Of course. I'd love that.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.906
Why?

40:09.031 --> 40:11.659
Did you get a job somewhere busy?

40:16.831 --> 40:17.915
Gosh.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.708
The dumplings are getting cold.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.252
Here.

40:25.714 --> 40:26.882
They're so good.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.845
Were you hungry?

40:32.513 --> 40:33.556
Yes.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.141
I was.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.815
If you feel uncomfortable,
please raise your hand.

40:42.898 --> 40:43.899
Okay.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.031
You must be tired. Go home and rest.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.117
You may experience vomiting and dizziness.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.870
Take your medication,
and drink plenty of water.

41:38.579 --> 41:39.747
Thank you.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.428
Uncle.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.348
You're here.

41:57.806 --> 41:59.058
Don't worry.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.893
The worst has passed.

42:01.143 --> 42:02.603
You should've called right away.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.525
Even as she was dying,

42:07.608 --> 42:09.652
she said not to call you.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.823
But how could I not?

42:14.949 --> 42:16.242
That's why I called.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.411
Your dad

42:20.412 --> 42:22.289
is a frightening man.

42:23.624 --> 42:26.502
Gosh, she is such a fool.

42:27.336 --> 42:28.879
She is so pathetic.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.716
When she was young,
she acted like she was so smart.

42:33.801 --> 42:34.969
But look how stupid she was.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.805
She called that monster a man,

42:37.930 --> 42:40.724
and she devoted her entire life to him.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.310
Stupid girl.

42:48.482 --> 42:49.942
The surgery...

42:52.361 --> 42:53.654
I'll do it.

42:55.614 --> 42:56.657
What?

42:57.866 --> 42:59.034
I will save

43:00.119 --> 43:01.537
your mom.

43:04.123 --> 43:07.751
I am sick of everything. I can't stand it.

43:08.502 --> 43:11.547
Your family is annoying me
and driving me crazy.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.134
That's why

43:16.135 --> 43:17.469
I'm going to do it.

43:19.722 --> 43:20.889
Uncle.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.017
That's enough.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.185
Why would your mom

43:25.853 --> 43:27.521
not want to live?

43:28.689 --> 43:31.483
Everyone wants to live. It's human nature.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.904
She'll do it if I'm the donor.

43:37.364 --> 43:38.574
Don't worry.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.452
Thank you, Uncle.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.331
Thank you.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.082
Thank you, Uncle.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.835
Why are you thanking me?

43:50.836 --> 43:53.714
This is between my sister and me.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.800
You should stay out of it now,

43:58.344 --> 44:00.179
and live your own life.

44:01.805 --> 44:03.057
Thank you.

44:23.410 --> 44:24.578
Where are we going?

44:24.703 --> 44:26.872
-I don't know.
-Let's hurry.

44:29.249 --> 44:31.543
Where were you all day
when you were supposed to be at work?

44:32.795 --> 44:35.422
-Just because you have connections--
-Stop it.

44:35.547 --> 44:36.590
Hey.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.550
Hurry and go get dinner.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.052
Don't be late tomorrow.

44:40.135 --> 44:41.220
Now go.

44:41.303 --> 44:42.971
-All right.
-Let's have chicken and beer.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.390
-Enjoy.
-Who is buying?

44:44.473 --> 44:45.849
-You're buying.
-Where are we going?

44:46.600 --> 44:47.810
I'm sorry.

44:49.019 --> 44:50.187
Are you all right?

44:51.939 --> 44:53.065
About what?

44:53.273 --> 44:55.109
Rumors die down quickly

44:55.192 --> 44:57.820
if they aren't true.

44:58.654 --> 44:59.905
Don't mind them.

45:00.322 --> 45:03.492
Anyone who knows you at all
will know the rumors aren't true.

45:03.575 --> 45:05.285
The rumors are ridiculous, anyway.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.331
It's okay. I don't care.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.458
I'll get going now.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.462
Wait, Hye-su.

45:16.630 --> 45:17.798
Well...

45:18.424 --> 45:20.342
The thing is...

45:21.260 --> 45:22.553
The truth is...

45:24.346 --> 45:27.266
Ji-hun's mom collapsed,
so she's at the hospital.

45:27.516 --> 45:30.686
I didn't know whether
or not I should tell you,

45:31.270 --> 45:33.397
but I thought you should know.

45:37.109 --> 45:39.027
You look tired.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.363
Gosh, I shouldn't have said anything.

45:41.447 --> 45:42.990
Go upstairs and rest.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.159
Gosh.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.256
Your right arm.

46:06.972 --> 46:08.474
Are you still mad at me?

46:09.808 --> 46:11.393
You said to do everything on my own.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.395
I'm just doing as you said.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.899
Do you want me to read to you?

46:17.024 --> 46:19.943
No. I can read by myself.

46:21.445 --> 46:22.613
Okay.

46:23.655 --> 46:24.948
Read by yourself then.

46:53.810 --> 46:54.978
Mom,

46:55.187 --> 46:56.355
what's wrong?

46:56.980 --> 46:59.024
I must have indigestion. I'm fine.
Go ahead and read.

47:03.278 --> 47:04.446
Mom.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.078
Mom!

47:14.373 --> 47:15.541
Mom.

47:15.832 --> 47:17.125
Are you okay?

47:17.876 --> 47:19.294
I'm okay.

47:20.712 --> 47:22.047
Mom!

47:23.632 --> 47:24.925
Mom.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.133
Oh, my.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.593
Sorry.

48:13.557 --> 48:14.975
Oh, my gosh.

48:15.517 --> 48:17.019
What's wrong with me?

48:18.186 --> 48:19.396
I'm sorry.

48:22.065 --> 48:23.317
I'll redo them.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.154
Excuse me.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.157
Hi, Hye-su.

48:31.325 --> 48:33.285
Ju-yeon, I'm sorry,

48:33.869 --> 48:35.954
but can you come over for a minute?

48:36.371 --> 48:38.665
Sure, of course.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.585
I'll come over. Okay.

48:41.877 --> 48:43.086
I'll come over.

48:43.295 --> 48:44.463
Thanks.

48:46.548 --> 48:47.841
-Mom.
-Yes?

48:48.425 --> 48:49.760
Are you not sick anymore?

48:50.677 --> 48:52.471
I'm all better now.

48:53.722 --> 48:55.015
Let's go to sleep.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.731
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

49:04.900 --> 49:06.151
Do you want a bedtime story?

49:07.694 --> 49:08.737
Yes?

49:10.072 --> 49:11.281
Hold on.

49:13.575 --> 49:16.203
Let's see.

49:17.746 --> 49:20.374
How far did we get last time?

49:20.707 --> 49:22.042
Up to the part

49:22.459 --> 49:25.128
where Belle said she'd go home
and come back.

49:25.253 --> 49:27.214
Up to that part?

49:28.173 --> 49:29.383
Here it is.

49:29.675 --> 49:31.551
"Belle promised the Beast

49:31.635 --> 49:34.805
that she'd stay with him forever.

49:35.722 --> 49:36.807
In return,

49:37.015 --> 49:40.727
she asked to see her family one last time.

49:42.354 --> 49:45.857
Then the Beast told her to return

49:45.941 --> 49:48.193
before the full moon.

49:49.653 --> 49:50.821
But Belle was

49:51.446 --> 49:54.825
having too much fun with her family

49:55.200 --> 49:58.453
and forgot about the promise.

49:59.204 --> 50:02.290
When she rushed back to the castle,

50:02.624 --> 50:04.584
she saw the Beast

50:04.668 --> 50:07.587
unconscious on the flower bed.

50:31.403 --> 50:33.196
When Belle's tear fell

50:34.948 --> 50:38.160
onto the Beast's face,

50:39.911 --> 50:41.872
to her amazement, the Beast

50:42.414 --> 50:44.958
opened his eyes.

50:46.668 --> 50:47.836
And

50:49.254 --> 50:51.965
the spell he was under

50:52.632 --> 50:55.552
was broken."

51:52.484 --> 51:53.527
I have...

51:57.072 --> 51:59.449
so much to do.

52:05.914 --> 52:08.208
I need to read to Eun-seong,

52:13.129 --> 52:14.714
see her start school,

52:20.512 --> 52:23.682
and do her hair every morning.

52:31.439 --> 52:33.817
I have so much to do.

52:55.964 --> 52:58.300
Wait!

52:58.550 --> 52:59.801
Oh, my.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.595
Look who's here?

53:02.387 --> 53:04.097
-Hello.
-Hold on.

53:04.222 --> 53:06.308
Wait. Hold on.

53:06.558 --> 53:09.519
Come inside.
Let me make you a hot cup of coffee.

53:09.644 --> 53:11.646
No, I'm in a rush.

53:11.730 --> 53:13.815
Go home to your wife.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.317
Wait.

53:16.568 --> 53:18.486
I said I don't have a wife!

53:18.570 --> 53:19.738
Sure!

53:19.946 --> 53:22.616
I'm going crazy here.

53:22.991 --> 53:25.035
Don't run!

53:33.668 --> 53:34.836
Are you all right?

53:37.005 --> 53:39.799
I need to go somewhere.
Look after Eun-seong for me.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.760
Where are you going this late at night?

53:42.385 --> 53:43.929
Sit down.

53:47.682 --> 53:49.392
Let's talk first.

53:49.809 --> 53:50.977
About what?

53:53.229 --> 53:54.397
Gosh.

53:54.481 --> 53:55.649
I couldn't do anything

53:56.191 --> 53:57.651
these past few days.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.946
I thought I was going crazy.

54:02.238 --> 54:03.740
Why would you go crazy?

54:04.240 --> 54:06.368
When do you start your treatment?

54:06.868 --> 54:08.036
I went today.

54:08.870 --> 54:10.455
I was afraid for nothing.

54:10.622 --> 54:11.873
It doesn't hurt at all.

54:15.752 --> 54:18.797
Why did you go alone?
I would've gone with you.

54:19.339 --> 54:20.382
What for?

54:20.924 --> 54:23.134
It's okay.
I will be doing this every day now.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.679
I'm telling you, it was nothing.

54:25.762 --> 54:27.138
I'll be cured in no time.

54:28.848 --> 54:30.600
You can be cured, right?

54:32.143 --> 54:33.186
Right?

54:33.520 --> 54:34.813
Of course.

54:39.192 --> 54:40.360
Goodness.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.530
Eun-seong, what should we do
about your mom?

54:45.699 --> 54:46.992
What should we do?

54:48.243 --> 54:49.285
Hey.

54:49.786 --> 54:51.246
You'll wake her.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.003
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

54:58.086 --> 54:59.129
Hye-su.

54:59.212 --> 55:00.463
I'll get going now.

55:01.548 --> 55:02.716
I'll be right back.

55:06.845 --> 55:08.722
Where are you going?

55:09.639 --> 55:10.682
Bye.

55:59.522 --> 56:00.565
Who are you?

56:04.152 --> 56:05.487
Hello.

56:06.362 --> 56:07.655
Hi.

56:08.990 --> 56:11.826
What's wrong?
Do you have something to say?

56:20.376 --> 56:22.295
Please tell her I'm sorry.

56:23.963 --> 56:25.006
For what?

56:25.757 --> 56:27.634
I came because I felt bad.

56:30.512 --> 56:31.721
I can't do the surgery.

56:33.848 --> 56:35.100
Something came up,

56:37.644 --> 56:39.104
so I can't do it.

56:41.648 --> 56:42.941
I'm so sorry.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.861
I don't know what's going on,

56:48.363 --> 56:49.948
but she has another donor.

56:52.784 --> 56:53.952
Don't worry.

56:54.702 --> 56:55.870
What?

56:56.162 --> 56:57.664
Ji-hun didn't tell you?

57:00.708 --> 57:02.001
I'm doing it.

57:08.842 --> 57:10.176
Thank you.

57:12.178 --> 57:13.847
Thank you.

57:16.850 --> 57:18.017
Thank you so much.

57:18.643 --> 57:19.978
Thank you so much.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.778
What is wrong with you?

57:33.158 --> 57:34.492
Thank you so much.

58:05.106 --> 58:06.232
Why did you come here?

58:09.068 --> 58:10.153
Why?

58:10.904 --> 58:12.864
Did you want to check on her condition?

58:17.952 --> 58:19.162
Don't worry about it.

58:19.579 --> 58:20.788
The contract is over anyway.

58:46.773 --> 58:47.815
-Uncle.
-Hi.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.067
Your mom is awake.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.360
-Really?
-Yes.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.070
Wait a second.

58:52.695 --> 58:55.448
That lady with the kid came.

58:55.907 --> 58:57.992
What happened between you two?

58:58.451 --> 59:00.662
Wasn't the surgery matter all settled?

59:01.788 --> 59:02.956
Did she say something?

59:03.206 --> 59:06.417
When I told her I was doing it,
she bawled uncontrollably.

59:07.126 --> 59:10.296
Gosh, she cried so sorrowfully.

59:10.713 --> 59:12.090
I was dumbfounded.

59:13.716 --> 59:14.968
What happened?

59:16.469 --> 59:17.637
Tell me.

59:18.471 --> 59:19.722
What is it?

59:19.931 --> 59:21.933
Why was she crying in front of me?

59:23.893 --> 59:25.144
Excuse me for a minute, Uncle.

59:27.230 --> 59:28.856
Ji-hun.

1:00:12.984 --> 1:00:14.694
Have you lost your mind?

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:18.072
You could've gotten hurt.
Do you want to die?

1:00:31.669 --> 1:00:32.837
Wait.

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:34.839
I need to talk to you.

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:47.518
I'm sorry.

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:56.611
I'm sorry about everything.

1:00:59.113 --> 1:01:00.823
You've done nothing wrong.

1:01:07.622 --> 1:01:09.707
I'm sorry that
I don't know anything about you!

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:17.048
I had no clue

1:01:18.091 --> 1:01:19.926
why I was being like this.

1:01:22.053 --> 1:01:23.429
But when I thought about it,

1:01:26.474 --> 1:01:28.601
I realized that
I didn't know anything about you.

1:01:30.269 --> 1:01:32.146
I memorized all the facts about you,

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:35.608
yet I don't know you at all.

1:01:39.612 --> 1:01:41.239
Shouldn't you teach me?

1:01:47.870 --> 1:01:49.706
I don't know if you have debts,

1:01:49.789 --> 1:01:51.165
or if you have a man,

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.959
or even if you're a murderer.

1:01:56.963 --> 1:02:00.174
I don't know a single thing,

1:02:08.141 --> 1:02:09.308
but it doesn't matter.

1:02:13.813 --> 1:02:14.897
I just want...

1:02:18.609 --> 1:02:20.903
I just want you by my side.

1:02:28.119 --> 1:02:29.287
I'll divorce you.

1:02:32.248 --> 1:02:33.791
If you want it that badly, I'll do it.

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:36.419
But please...

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:41.674
Can't you just stay by my side?

1:02:51.893 --> 1:02:53.853
I can't give you up.

1:02:56.731 --> 1:02:58.149
I'm sorry about everything.

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:01.569
About everything.

1:03:06.365 --> 1:03:07.784
Please forgive me, just this once.

1:03:11.913 --> 1:03:13.831
Please forgive me just this once, Hye-su.

1:03:51.953 --> 1:03:54.121
