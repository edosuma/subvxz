terribly elegant.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.156

00:26.200 --> 00:27.157
You see?

00:27.201 --> 00:29.420
Much more seductive.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.119
Much less for the

00:47.177 --> 00:52.095

but he just doesn't answer.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.096
Maybe it's not your phone.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.837
Maybe it's your boyfriend.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.882
Maybe he's doing it on purpose.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.101
You know?

00:58.145 --> 01:00.147
Maybe he just...

01:00.190 --> 01:02.062
finds you too damn distracting.

01:02.105 --> 01:05.108
So he's ignoring
my calls and texts?

01:05.152 --> 01:07.241
He's ignoring his
phone, not you.

the conference room?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.841
While Benny sits
in my office?

03:52.884 --> 03:55.235
These people were very
specific on the phone.

03:55.278 --> 03:58.063
They want to hire us to
represent them in court.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.240
I am not a lawyer.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.287

Mr. Weeks.My deepest condolences.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.406
Unfortunately,
our principal attorney,

05:19.449 --> 05:21.712
Mr. Benjamin Colón, couldn't
be with us this morning.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.454
So I have asked Chunk Palmer,

05:24.498 --> 05:26.717
an attorney we work with
quite a bit,

05:26.761 --> 05:28.328
and his co-counsel
Taylor Rentzel to sit in

05:28.371 --> 05:30.068
with us during
this meeting.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.943
I'm just gonna go take care
of that other little thing.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.730
[door opens, closes]

05:39.774 --> 05:41.950
When my older brother
died last week,

05:41.993 --> 05:43.125
I was shocked.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.953
But not surprised.

05:44.996 --> 05:47.869
We didn't talk about it
outside of the family,

05:47.912 --> 05:50.132
but he had a heart condition
that he discovered

05:50.175 --> 05:52.221
shortly after he turned 40.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.963
I remember thinking at the time,

05:55.006 --> 05:58.009
uh, "What is it about...

05:58.053 --> 06:00.621
"these visionaries that...

06:00.664 --> 06:03.406
so many of them
seem to leave us so early?"

06:03.450 --> 06:05.887
Is that the trade-off

06:05.930 --> 06:08.063
for getting to be someone
who changes the world?

06:10.152 --> 06:11.632
[exhales] I won't lie.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.068
Uh... [chuckles]

06:13.111 --> 06:15.549
Holding together a company
that always seemed

06:15.592 --> 06:17.464
to have the next great idea
is quite daunting

06:17.507 --> 06:20.118
when the idea guy
has left the building.

06:22.207 --> 06:25.123
What is it we can do
for you, Mr. Weeks?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.647
I received a call
from my brother's

06:26.690 --> 06:29.040
primary care physician
the other night.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.912
He had received a call
from the hospital

06:30.955 --> 06:32.870
that treated my brother
after they found him

06:32.914 --> 06:34.176
unconscious in his office.

06:36.047 --> 06:39.311
Turns out, my brother did not
die... of heart failure.

06:41.139 --> 06:44.926
He died
of a nitroglycerin overdose.

06:44.969 --> 06:48.233
Obviously, this information
has not been made public yet.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.629
I don't understand,
how can we be of help?

06:54.196 --> 06:56.154
The treatment plan
my brother followed

06:56.198 --> 06:58.113
only called for him
to take nitroglycerin

06:58.156 --> 07:01.072
with the onset of angina
or chest pains.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.555
He did not take it
on a daily basis.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.514
Sometimes months
or weeks would go by

07:07.557 --> 07:09.037
and he would not take it.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.647
The point being?

07:12.127 --> 07:15.173
That m... my brother
lost his life...

07:16.653 --> 07:19.090
...because his cardiologist
apparently prescribed

07:19.134 --> 07:21.876
a lethal dosage of this drug.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.709
But isn't it possible
he simply took too much?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.362
More pills than
he should have?

07:30.406 --> 07:32.974
My brother was a famously
fastidious person,

07:33.017 --> 07:34.192
especially about his health.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.411
He followed instructions,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.152
particularly medical
instructions,

07:37.195 --> 07:38.414
to the letter.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.329
And he was a world-class
germophobe.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.462
There is no chance in hell

07:42.505 --> 07:46.074
that he took more of this drug
than he was directed to.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.250
That's gonna be
difficult to prove.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.165
That's why I'm here.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.951
I want to sue this doctor.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.565
I want to put him
out of business.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.480
I want to make sure
he never does this

08:00.523 --> 08:04.396
to anyone else ever again.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.224
And I know I'll need
some great lawyering

08:06.268 --> 08:08.052
and a sympathetic jury
to help me do that

08:08.096 --> 08:10.185
and those are the two things
you people specialize in.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.229
Aren't they?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.931
Take this case.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.678
That is a $1 million retainer
to get you started.

Just let me know when
you burn through that

10:02.819 --> 10:05.779
the front and back
of Mr. Weeks' hands

10:05.822 --> 10:08.912
were saturated in
extremely high levels

10:08.956 --> 10:11.175
of a nitroglycerin ointment.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.961
I believe it was that,
in combination with

10:14.004 --> 10:16.572
the nitroglycerin pill
that he took that night

10:16.616 --> 10:18.966
that proved fatal.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.924
Well, this is the first

I needed to confer
with Mr. Weeks's MD

don't think so.

There was no reason for him
to be using that ointment,

the front and back of his hands,

Are you all right?
You sound strange.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.089
[exhales]

12:22.132 --> 12:23.699
It's been a strange morning.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.222
MARISSA:
Well, I can't wait to hear.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.789
So, who starts?

12:26.833 --> 12:29.313
You do. And take your time;
the sooner you're done

12:29.357 --> 12:31.011
the sooner I have to
go back out and mingle.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.839
Well, let's start
with the easy stuff.

12:32.882 --> 12:33.927
Diane is all set.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.842
I went ahead and booked
the tickets

12:35.885 --> 12:37.495
and the cars.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.888
She's gonna be here
Saturday morning

12:38.932 --> 12:40.498
and she sounds
pretty damned excited to me.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.022
Excellent,
I'm counting the hours.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.023
What else you got?

12:43.066 --> 12:44.807
Well, the big bulletin is:

12:44.851 --> 12:47.288
the results from
the independent autopsy are in.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.943
And while everybody is certain
it was nitroglycerin

12:49.986 --> 12:51.031
that killed Mr. Weeks, it seems

12:51.074 --> 12:52.946
pretty unlikely
it was his doctor.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.034
Ah-ha.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.644
Does our client know?

12:55.687 --> 12:57.515
Well, I was waiting to tell you.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.082
Well, have Chunk see
if he can set up

12:59.126 --> 13:00.301
an emergency meeting
with him today

13:00.344 --> 13:01.606
to bring him up to speed.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.912
Next?

13:02.956 --> 13:04.348
You're up.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.397
I saw Izzy at the funeral.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.878
Well, that couldn't have been
a surprise.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.662
She looked so...

13:15.142 --> 13:16.360
fragile.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.928
That couldn't have been
a surprise, either.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.844
I didn't know what to do.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.412
I didn't do any of it very well.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.631
What did you want to do?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.416
[sighs]

13:28.459 --> 13:30.853
I wanted to save her.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.856
I've always wanted to save her.

13:33.900 --> 13:34.988
[bed creaks]

13:39.862 --> 13:42.169
I got to go.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.875
[sobbing softly]

13:52.919 --> 13:54.921
[sniffles]

13:57.184 --> 14:00.100
[exhales]

14:00.143 --> 14:02.232
[sobbing]

14:18.031 --> 14:20.033
CHUNK:
Dr. Bull extends his apologies

14:20.076 --> 14:21.817
for not being here personally,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.863
but we, too,
had a death in our family.

14:23.906 --> 14:27.344
Mr. Colón, our principal
attorney, and the man who

14:27.388 --> 14:29.869
will be calling all the shots
for your case should it

14:29.912 --> 14:32.262
go to court, um,
he lost his father this week.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.960
Sorry.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.918
And thank you for coming to us.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.528
No thanks necessary.

14:37.572 --> 14:38.921
I prefer it.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.837
I have a very dispirited
company on my hands.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.318
Our stock is cratering,
our sales are suffering.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.146
So, any excuse to get out.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.582
TAYLOR:
Well, we have some news.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.932
We conducted a second
independent autopsy

14:49.976 --> 14:51.803
on your late brother
and he definitely died

14:51.847 --> 14:53.718
of a nitroglycerin
overdose.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.590
But the overdose
had nothing to do

14:55.633 --> 14:57.287
with the pills
he was taking.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.507
Excuse me?

14:59.550 --> 15:01.509
We don't think
your brother's cardiologist

15:01.552 --> 15:03.206
was involved at all.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.079
Is there a chance
that you could give us

15:06.122 --> 15:07.819
a list of those close to him?

15:07.863 --> 15:10.257
We'd like to do some research,
see if we can find someone

15:10.300 --> 15:12.999
who might have had
a motive to do this.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.001
One last thing,
were you ever aware

15:15.044 --> 15:16.219
that your brother
was using this

15:16.263 --> 15:18.830
nitroglycerin ointment
on his hands?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.049
On his hands?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.659
No.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.183
Like I told you,
James was a germophobe.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.749
A world-class germophobe.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.317
Only thing he ever put
on his hands was sanitizer.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.319
He put it on
by the boatload.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.591
Good morning, Izzy's voice mail.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.203
I was thinking maybe
we should talk.

15:43.246 --> 15:44.813
I left a voice mail
for you last night,

15:44.856 --> 15:46.815
but you never got back to me,

15:46.858 --> 15:50.166
which I completely understand,
I just--

15:52.212 --> 15:54.518
It is a new day.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.868
The sun is out,
I would love to hear your voice.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.220
I hope you're okay.

16:02.309 --> 16:05.660
And one other thing,
I'm hoping that...

16:05.703 --> 16:08.663
you didn't say anything to Benny
about what happened.

16:08.706 --> 16:09.881
And if you did say
something to Benny,

16:09.925 --> 16:11.840
I'm hoping you will...

16:11.883 --> 16:14.625
call me and let me know.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.976
Which is not why I'm calling.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.414
Crap.

16:20.457 --> 16:21.850
Just call me, will you?

16:21.893 --> 16:23.156
We were married.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.809
[exhales]

16:24.853 --> 16:26.202
TAYLOR:
I mean,

16:26.246 --> 16:27.812
she's the girlfriend,
she's not in the will,

16:27.856 --> 16:29.510
she's only known him
six or seven months.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.294
So there's no
apparent motive,

16:31.338 --> 16:34.297
but the deeper I dig,
the weirder it gets.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.952
And his girlfriend,
this Carolyn,

16:36.996 --> 16:37.953
she's on her way over?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.650
Within the hour.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.013
Carolyn Kelly?

16:57.059 --> 16:58.974
And you are?

17:00.236 --> 17:01.716
Dr. Jason Bull.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.458
I think the more
tantalizing question is,

17:04.501 --> 17:07.069
and youare...?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.724
The only reason
I ask is

17:09.767 --> 17:12.379
this lady, Alice Hatcher,

17:12.422 --> 17:15.208
she married her
high school sweetheart.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.513
In Buffalo, New York.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.559
He became
a long haul trucker.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.475
Left their home one night
in the middle of a blizzard

17:21.518 --> 17:24.086
to drive a truck
full of mattresses to Chicago.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.436
Apparently he had drugs
in his system,

17:26.480 --> 17:28.090
which surprised
his friends because

17:28.134 --> 17:31.093
none of them
ever knew him to use drugs.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.574
One of them even suggested
that the drugs

17:33.617 --> 17:35.880
might have been hidden
in something he ate or drank.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.405
I guess we'll never know.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.103
Slid off an overpass,
went over a guardrail,

17:41.147 --> 17:42.974
fell 35 feet
to the highway below.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.760
42 feet.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.370
I became a widow at 22.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.678
Worst day of my life.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.071
I'm sure it was.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.942
So here's
a fascinating tidbit:

17:53.985 --> 17:56.858
the trucker who,
according to his friends,

17:56.901 --> 18:00.122
loved his wife with
every fiber of his being

18:00.166 --> 18:02.646
and made $30,000 a year,

18:02.690 --> 18:06.346
had a life insurance policy
worth $2 million.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.217
Which of these things
is not like the other?

18:09.697 --> 18:11.090
And Alice...

18:11.133 --> 18:12.874
Me.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.702
was the sole beneficiary.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.051
BENNY:
Now, this lady...

18:16.095 --> 18:17.835
sure looks like you.

18:17.879 --> 18:20.316
But her name is
Brenda McConnell.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.752
And her hair is...

18:21.796 --> 18:23.450
That's me.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.279
You know,
all you had to do was ask.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.932
I changed my name because

18:27.976 --> 18:29.717
I suddenly came into
a lot of money

18:29.760 --> 18:30.935
and I didn't want
the lowlifes

18:30.979 --> 18:32.807
from high school
to look me up,

18:32.850 --> 18:35.549
track me down and try and figure
out some way of getting some.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.072
Hmm. Makes perfect sense.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.988
Change your hair color,
change your hometown.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.904
You met your
second husband

18:42.947 --> 18:46.255
in San Francisco
seven years ago, a lovely man.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.780
Had a trust fund
worth over $20 million.

18:49.824 --> 18:53.871
Sadly, was an insulin-dependant
diabetic

18:53.915 --> 18:56.918
who... somehow, despite having

18:56.961 --> 18:59.921
cared for himself without
incident his entire life

18:59.964 --> 19:03.185
injected five times
more insulin than needed

19:03.229 --> 19:06.145
and died shortly thereafter,
leaving Brenda...

19:06.188 --> 19:07.363
Me.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.365
...a very wealthy widow.

19:09.409 --> 19:10.845
Again.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.500
Second-worst day of my life.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.719
I can only imagine.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.547
Which brings us to...

19:17.591 --> 19:18.809
Carolyn.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.334
That's me.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.249
And the death
of James Weeks.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.817
Third-worst day of my life.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.603
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm starting to sense

19:29.646 --> 19:31.822
you're a very unlucky lady
to be around.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.129
Are you implying I had something
to do with James's death?

19:34.173 --> 19:37.219
No, I'm flat-out stating it.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.003
I just got off the phone
with Kevin Weeks,

19:39.047 --> 19:41.745
your late boyfriend's brother.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.270
He has asked us to file suit
on his behalf

19:44.313 --> 19:46.881
against you, Carolyn Kelly.

19:46.924 --> 19:50.667
AKA Brenda McConnell,
AKA Alice Hatcher,

19:50.711 --> 19:52.103
for wrongful death,

19:52.147 --> 19:53.888
intentional infliction
of emotional distress,

19:53.931 --> 19:55.933
battery
and tortious interference.

19:55.977 --> 19:59.720
Whew. That's a mouthful.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.896
And we're gonna keep
your tab open,

20:01.939 --> 20:04.072
just in case we come
across any other goodies

20:04.115 --> 20:06.248
as we continue
to investigate.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.032
You have been served.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.905
Based on what?

20:10.948 --> 20:13.212
Let's just say for the moment
I'm playing a hunch.

20:14.604 --> 20:15.866
And here's another one:

20:15.910 --> 20:17.955
you should get
yourself a lawyer.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.001
CHUNK:
Come on, admit it.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.917
Fourth-worst day of your life?

20:27.182 --> 20:28.923
[knocking on glass]

20:28.966 --> 20:31.012
He doesn't live here anymore.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.890
First time
in the big city, fella?

20:39.934 --> 20:41.675
Hey.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.677
If I wanted some
smart-ass banter,

20:43.720 --> 20:45.679
I'd just go home
and talk to myself.

20:45.722 --> 20:49.857
Someone'sin an excellent mood.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.772
[sighs]

20:54.296 --> 20:56.777
How many times are you allowed
to leave a message

20:56.820 --> 20:58.387
without getting an answer
before you move

20:58.431 --> 21:01.129
from concerned acquaintance
to potential predator?

21:01.172 --> 21:03.914
Give me a time frame.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.874
36 hours or so.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.093
And how many calls or texts?

21:09.137 --> 21:11.487
I'd rather not say.

21:11.531 --> 21:12.749
You should just drop everything

21:12.793 --> 21:14.360
and register
as a sex offender right now.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.710
Hmm.

21:17.711 --> 21:18.799
Diana?

21:21.845 --> 21:23.238
I'd rather not talk about it.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.023
And this can't be what
you came in here to discuss.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.939
No, but this is so much better.

21:31.246 --> 21:35.032
You win.
Wanted to tell you Danny called.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.773
All the hand sanitizer

21:36.817 --> 21:39.254
in James Weeks' office
is long gone.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.431
Oh. No doubt
our girl swooped in there

21:42.475 --> 21:45.869
and made sure
she left no evidence behind.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.350
But Danny did find a bottle in
his locker at the company gym.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.786
She dropped it off for testing,

21:49.830 --> 21:51.875
and we should know something
by morning.

21:56.706 --> 22:00.319
So, if Diana's not taking
your calls,

22:00.362 --> 22:05.062
should I...
perhaps cancel her flight?

22:06.107 --> 22:09.545
Yeah, you probably should.

22:09.589 --> 22:12.809
Iprobably should.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.377
I'll call her.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.553
And it's Izzy
who's not returning my calls.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.253
Oh, my.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.608
I'll call Diana.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.654
Forget I said anything.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.360
BENNY: And after testing
the bottle of hand sanitizer

22:41.403 --> 22:44.363
found in Mr. Weeks's gym
locker, what did you find?

22:44.406 --> 22:46.539
That it contained
an extraordinarily high

22:46.582 --> 22:50.020
concentration
of nitroglycerin ointment.

22:50.064 --> 22:51.979
And in your expert opinion,
Doctor,

22:52.022 --> 22:54.895
is there any medical basis
upon which to believe

22:54.938 --> 22:57.376
that perhaps Mr. Weeks himself

22:57.419 --> 23:01.118
might have mixed this ointment
into his hand sanitizer?

23:01.162 --> 23:02.946
No, none whatsoever.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.427
For one thing,
Mr. Weeks was under the care

23:05.471 --> 23:07.951
of one of the city's
finest cardiologists.

23:07.995 --> 23:12.042
For another, his prescription
was for pills, not ointment.

23:12.086 --> 23:16.133
And thirdly, his prescription
clearly indicated

23:16.177 --> 23:19.746
that he was only to use the drug
upon the onset of symptoms,

23:19.789 --> 23:21.182
not as an ongoing
course of treatment.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.402
And another thing

23:23.445 --> 23:25.882
that strongly suggests
that Mr. Weeks

23:25.926 --> 23:27.493
had no idea
the hand sanitizer

23:27.536 --> 23:29.016
he was using was tainted

23:29.059 --> 23:33.150
is that those who do use
nitroglycerin ointment

23:33.194 --> 23:36.153
know full well
that it is not meant

23:36.197 --> 23:38.547
to be massaged into the skin.

23:38.591 --> 23:41.115
Vigorously rubbing it all over

23:41.158 --> 23:44.379
your hands,
as one does with sanitizer,

23:44.423 --> 23:47.164
would significantly increase
the potency

23:47.208 --> 23:48.905
of an already potent drug,

23:48.949 --> 23:52.082
a drug
that must be precisely dosed

23:52.126 --> 23:55.869
in order to be helpful
and not harmful.

23:55.912 --> 23:59.481
So, based on the concentration
of nitroglycerin

23:59.525 --> 24:03.442
found in the hand sanitizer
and the manner of application,

24:03.485 --> 24:06.575
how many squirts of sanitizer
would it take

24:06.619 --> 24:10.666
to cause heart failure for a man
in James Weeks's condition?

24:10.710 --> 24:12.799
In combination
with one of his pills?

24:12.842 --> 24:13.974
Just one.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.107
BENNY:
Thank you, Dr. Barnes.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.326
No further questions,
Your Honor.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.981
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
Good morning, Doctor.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.505
Just for the record,

24:23.549 --> 24:26.508
the Medical Examiner
for the City of New York

24:26.552 --> 24:29.032
ruled James Weeks's death
an accident.

24:29.076 --> 24:30.686
Isn't that correct?

24:30.730 --> 24:31.948
That's correct.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.167
And you don't have the authority

24:33.210 --> 24:35.169
to overrule that finding,

24:35.212 --> 24:36.910
do you, Dr. Barnes?

24:36.953 --> 24:39.303
It's not a question
of overruling.

24:39.347 --> 24:43.612
I was asked to formulate my own
independent scientific opinion.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.746
Which I did,
based on an examination

24:46.789 --> 24:49.836
that was significantly
more thorough.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.491
And again, for the record,

24:52.534 --> 24:54.884
the plaintiff and
his lawyers paid you

24:54.928 --> 24:57.974
a generous sum
to formulate this opinion.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.715
Isn't that right, Dr. Barnes?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.675
Yes. Just as I'm sure
your client

25:02.718 --> 25:05.416
is paying you handsomely

25:05.460 --> 25:07.549
to ask me these questions.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.901
Now, in the interest
of being thorough

25:11.945 --> 25:14.600
and to be doubly sure
that the Weeks family

25:14.643 --> 25:17.559
gets absolutely everything
they paid you for,

25:17.603 --> 25:19.735
did you find any
evidence of any kind

25:19.779 --> 25:22.825
to indicate that Carolyn
Kelly is the person

25:22.869 --> 25:25.393
who mixed this
deadly nitroglycerin

25:25.436 --> 25:27.656
into James Weeks's sanitizer?

25:27.700 --> 25:29.919
No, I didn't.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.182
No further questions,
Your Honor.

25:32.226 --> 25:34.837
[phone ringing]

25:37.144 --> 25:39.102
[chuckles softly]

25:40.147 --> 25:41.888
Izzy.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.934
IZZY:
I heard you don't drink anymore.

25:44.978 --> 25:47.937
Well, don't believe
everything you hear.

25:47.981 --> 25:51.114
You remember
where Glassman's is?

25:51.158 --> 25:53.160
Want to meet me there tomorrow
at 8:00?

25:54.683 --> 25:56.903
I'd like that a lot, actually.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.949
Great. Now stop calling me.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.741
BENNY:
I have to be honest with you.

26:10.786 --> 26:12.788
I don't know what
to do with this.

26:12.832 --> 26:16.183
There's no evidence.
There's no nothing.

26:16.226 --> 26:20.622
The most damning thing
about her is that...

26:20.666 --> 26:23.756
it appears she's done
this two other times

26:23.799 --> 26:25.627
to two other men,

26:25.671 --> 26:28.195
but we can't even
bring that up in court.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.500
Why not?

26:29.544 --> 26:32.199
Well, to begin with,
she was never charged.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.593
And even if she
had been charged,

26:34.636 --> 26:36.769
the court would almost
always disallow it.

26:36.812 --> 26:39.336
But why?

26:39.380 --> 26:41.774
Relevant evidence

26:41.817 --> 26:44.124
is evidence tending
to prove or disprove

26:44.167 --> 26:46.126
that someone did something.

26:46.169 --> 26:48.519
But it... The fact that
they did it in the past

26:48.563 --> 26:51.087
doesn't actually prove that
they did it in the present.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.046
If only we could prove
that it was Carolyn

26:53.089 --> 26:55.004
who put that stuff
in the hand sanitizer.

26:55.048 --> 26:58.051
By tomorrow, when we
basically have to rest our case

26:58.094 --> 27:01.532
because other than the accused,
we have no other witnesses.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.186
[sighs]

27:03.230 --> 27:06.276
So... that's it?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.670
We're done?

27:08.714 --> 27:10.890
Is this woman some kind
of criminal mastermind?

27:10.933 --> 27:15.024
I mean, all of us,
all of this technology...

27:15.068 --> 27:18.027
and we still
can't prove anything?

27:18.071 --> 27:20.073
We still don't even know why
she did it.

27:20.116 --> 27:21.640
She kills for money.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.642
Why can't we find the money?

27:27.123 --> 27:28.995
I was reading
in the paper this morning

27:29.038 --> 27:30.474
about all the people
losing their shirts

27:30.518 --> 27:33.521
because of Weeks Dynamic stock
going into the toilet.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.044
Well, hey, well,
the world believes

27:35.088 --> 27:37.307
that without James, there
is no Weeks Dynamic.

27:37.351 --> 27:38.961
TAYLOR:
And they're probably right.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.702
What did his brother say
that day he came in here?

27:40.746 --> 27:42.182
"Holding together a company

27:42.225 --> 27:45.011
"that always seemed to have
the next great idea

27:45.054 --> 27:47.927
is really hard when the idea guy
has left the building."

27:47.970 --> 27:49.755
Wait, wait.

27:49.798 --> 27:52.018
What is that old expression?

27:52.061 --> 27:54.629
"For everybody who makes money
in the stock market,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.110
someone has to lose."

27:57.153 --> 27:58.807
I never understood that.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.548
My ex-husband.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.985
He's a stockbroker.
He understands it.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.074
It's the only thing
he ever wanted to talk about.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.686
The thousands of ways
he could make you money.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.471
Taylor...

28:10.514 --> 28:11.777
there's a free piece of pizza

28:11.820 --> 28:12.952
in it for you
if you will call him

28:12.995 --> 28:14.823
and ask him
two questions for me.

28:14.867 --> 28:18.000
One:
so, if everybody in the world

28:18.044 --> 28:19.698
loses money
when James Weeks dies,

28:19.741 --> 28:21.134
who makes money?

28:21.177 --> 28:23.963
And two:
what would it have been worth

28:24.006 --> 28:28.054
if someone knew exactly when
he was going to die?

28:28.097 --> 28:31.971
[chuckles]:
Um... I'll try.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.321
I'll call him.
I don't know if I'll get him.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.932
It's okay. I'm here all night.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.934
He sometimes
doesn't want to speak to me

28:38.978 --> 28:40.936
if it's not about our son.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.112
Make it about your son.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.074
Do you mind
if I use the conference room?

28:48.117 --> 28:49.553
Use anything you want.

28:57.126 --> 28:58.649
Uh...

28:58.693 --> 29:01.000
Yes?Can I get you anything?

29:01.043 --> 29:03.872
Can I bring you anything?

29:03.916 --> 29:05.918
A motive?

29:17.103 --> 29:18.974
Psst!

29:19.018 --> 29:21.063
[whispers]:
Hey.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.110
What are you so happy about?

29:24.153 --> 29:27.896
This has all the makings
of a pretty horrible day.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.419
I got the world on a string.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.726
I got three hours of sleep.
I got a hot date tonight,

29:31.770 --> 29:34.598
and I know what that black widow
did and how she did it.

29:34.642 --> 29:38.080
If you're messing with me,
this is so cruel.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.691
And I think I have a way we can
talk about her first two victims

29:40.735 --> 29:43.042
without the judge
throwing the book at us.

29:43.085 --> 29:46.393
BENNY:
Good morning, Ms. Kelly.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.482
I know you've been through
a lot, so I'll try to...

29:48.525 --> 29:51.746
get this over with as quickly
and painlessly as I can.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.661
Thank you.

29:53.704 --> 29:57.534
Now, if I can,
I'd like to go back

29:57.578 --> 30:00.320
24 years to the death
of your first husband.

30:00.363 --> 30:01.843
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
Objection.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.062
Relevance?

30:03.105 --> 30:04.846
In fact,
may we approach the bench?

30:04.890 --> 30:07.762
You read my mind.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.026
How red is it?

30:11.070 --> 30:12.854
It's like a forest fire in here.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.813
All red. No green.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.598
Your Honor, I think we all know

30:17.641 --> 30:18.991
what this man
is trying to do here.

30:19.034 --> 30:21.297
Allow me, please.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.299
Mr. Colón...

30:23.343 --> 30:25.911
I know all about this woman's
two previous marriages.

30:25.954 --> 30:30.219
And I know all about her
husbands meeting untimely ends.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.655
But as you well know,

30:31.699 --> 30:34.702
none of that
can be considered admissible.

30:34.745 --> 30:37.792
And none of that
is actually relevant.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.882
Your Honor, if you'll allow me,

30:40.926 --> 30:43.450
I did not ask the question
as an avenue

30:43.493 --> 30:46.366
to explore how
her husbands may have died

30:46.409 --> 30:50.196
or her possible involvement
in those deaths.

30:50.239 --> 30:53.416
I'm simply going down
another road here.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.506
And if you'll just give me
a little room...

30:56.550 --> 30:58.552
Fine, Mr. Colón.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.337
But the operative word here
is "little."

31:01.381 --> 31:03.296
[whispers]:
And you don't want to push me.

31:03.339 --> 31:05.864
Not I. Not ever.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.648
Proceed.

31:09.650 --> 31:12.348
As I was saying...

31:12.392 --> 31:14.002
after your first husband died

31:14.046 --> 31:16.613
in that horrible
traffic accident,

31:16.657 --> 31:19.703
you went back to school,
didn't you?

31:19.747 --> 31:21.444
Yes.

31:21.488 --> 31:24.012
And what was it
that you studied?

31:24.056 --> 31:25.971
Personal finance.

31:26.014 --> 31:27.929
Personal finance, okay.

31:27.973 --> 31:32.064
Any particular reason you chose
to study personal finance?

31:33.761 --> 31:35.937
I-I'm guessing
it's because you were young

31:35.981 --> 31:38.505
and you didn't have
much experience with money.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.638
I believe your husband
had some life insurance.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.466
Objection again.
What does this have to do

31:43.510 --> 31:45.077
with Mr. Weeks' death?

31:49.342 --> 31:51.822
The ice is getting paper-thin

31:51.866 --> 31:53.389
where you're standing,
Mr. Colón.

31:53.433 --> 31:56.262
And the sun is coming out,
and the temperature is rising.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.090
Am I being clear?

31:58.133 --> 32:00.005
Crystal clear.

32:00.048 --> 32:02.137
Thank you.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.099
So, again,

32:07.142 --> 32:10.406
why did you choose
to study personal finance?

32:10.450 --> 32:13.757
It's very much what you said.

32:13.801 --> 32:17.065
My husband died unexpectedly.

32:17.109 --> 32:20.808
Thankfully,
he had quite a bit of insurance,

32:20.851 --> 32:22.157
and I needed to find ways

32:22.201 --> 32:24.377
to make that money last
as long as possible.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.031
That makes perfect sense.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.902
Now, in the course
of your studies,

32:27.946 --> 32:31.123
I'm sure you spent some time
learning about the stock market.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.647
It was part
of the curriculum, yes.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.302
And just to get the obvious
question out of the way,

32:36.345 --> 32:39.131
do you own any stock
in Weeks Dynamic?

32:39.174 --> 32:40.523
No.

32:40.567 --> 32:43.613
Not a single share, not ever.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.746
James kept encouraging me
to invest.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.183
I think he thought
it would secure my future,

32:48.227 --> 32:50.142
but... it made me uncomfortable.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.013
Well, that's
very admirable.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.884
Yeah, Bull, I don't see
where you're going here,

32:53.928 --> 32:55.408
and neither does the jury.

32:55.451 --> 32:57.584
Just remember what the young
doctor said to his mother

32:57.627 --> 33:00.021
when she asked
what he wanted for Christmas.

33:00.065 --> 33:01.675
Patience.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.678
Do you know anything
about "shorting stocks"?

33:06.158 --> 33:09.074
"Shorting stocks."
Are you familiar with that?

33:11.554 --> 33:13.774
I've certainly heard of it.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.255
I'm sure in the course
of the four years at school

33:16.298 --> 33:19.040
we talked about it, but...

33:19.084 --> 33:22.043
honestly, I...
I don't remember very much.

33:22.087 --> 33:25.090
So if I asked you
to explain it to the jury,

33:25.133 --> 33:27.788
you... couldn't or wouldn't?

33:27.831 --> 33:31.052
I haven't been to college
in over a decade.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.445
[chuckles]:
Ah. Well, that's funny.

33:32.488 --> 33:35.274
Because according to my notes,
you took a course

33:35.317 --> 33:38.103
in "Alternative
Earning Strategies

33:38.146 --> 33:39.843
for the Stock Market."

33:39.887 --> 33:42.063
"Shorting."

33:42.107 --> 33:46.459
Wouldn't you consider that
an alternative earning strategy?

33:46.502 --> 33:49.114
I suppose you might.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.420
Your Honor!What, Counsel?

33:51.464 --> 33:55.250
He's heading down a road, and
I'm sensing we're almost there.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.644
Are we almost there, Mr. Colón?

33:57.687 --> 33:58.993
Oh, we are, Your Honor.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.386
Great. Continue, then.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.996
Thank you.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.304
Now, as I understand it,
this... "shorting" stuff,

34:05.347 --> 34:08.046
you could make
a lot of money doing it.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.395
You just...

34:09.438 --> 34:11.092
have to know some things

34:11.136 --> 34:14.487
and be willing
to take some risks, right?

34:14.530 --> 34:17.490
In theory, I guess.Okay.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.970
So, help me understand.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.799
Say there's
a really successful stock.

34:22.843 --> 34:27.674
Say... Weeks Dynamic,
prior to your boyfriend's death,

34:27.717 --> 34:29.850
just as a hypothetical.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.112
Objection!

34:31.156 --> 34:32.722
Overruled.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.333
Let's say it's going

34:34.376 --> 34:36.509
for a hundred dollars a
share, and someone wanted

34:36.552 --> 34:38.511
to short it--
they would call a broker

34:38.554 --> 34:40.513
and make a deal to what?

34:40.556 --> 34:43.777
Borrow, not buy, say...

34:43.820 --> 34:45.822
a hundred thousand shares?

34:45.866 --> 34:48.129
That sound
about right?Objection!

34:48.173 --> 34:50.175
Calls for facts
not in evidence.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.264
It's a hypothetical,
Your Honor.

34:52.307 --> 34:54.048
The jury understands that.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.050
The witness studied
personal finance.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.053
I'm simply asking her
to use her expertise

34:59.097 --> 35:01.969
to help us understand
a business concept

35:02.012 --> 35:05.146
we might otherwise
not be familiar with.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.322
The witness will answer
the question.

35:11.326 --> 35:12.675
[sighs]

35:12.719 --> 35:14.851
It seems to make
sense so far.

35:14.895 --> 35:18.420
Great! So now that
we've borrowed these shares

35:18.464 --> 35:21.423
at a hundred dollars apiece,
we have to turn around

35:21.467 --> 35:23.773
and sell those shares
at a hundred,

35:23.817 --> 35:25.906
a hundred and one,
a hundred and two,

35:25.949 --> 35:29.170
a hundred and three--
isn't that correct?

35:30.215 --> 35:32.521
I believe that's the idea.

35:32.565 --> 35:35.655
No, but wait--
we don't actually own them.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.787
So now we've got to make good

35:37.831 --> 35:40.312
to the person
we borrowed them from.

35:40.355 --> 35:41.661
Right?

35:41.704 --> 35:43.271
Of course.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.055
What if...

35:45.099 --> 35:47.188
what if they were worth
a lot less

35:47.232 --> 35:49.886
than when you borrowed them
five days earlier?

35:49.930 --> 35:52.367
What if, as fate would have it,

35:52.411 --> 35:55.936
the head of the company
suddenly passed away?

35:57.155 --> 35:59.548
I'm sorry, what is the question?

35:59.592 --> 36:02.812
Did you short 40,000 shares
of Weeks stock

36:02.856 --> 36:06.164
during the five days
prior to James Weeks's death?

36:07.948 --> 36:10.124

BENNY: Your Honor,
the plaintiff

36:14.259 --> 36:16.957
would like
to enter into evidence...

36:17.000 --> 36:19.786
this collection
of paperwork

36:19.829 --> 36:22.571
initiated
by the defendant

36:22.615 --> 36:26.184
to create a string
of shell companies

36:26.227 --> 36:28.011
for the sole purpose

36:28.055 --> 36:31.058
of disguising Ms.
Kelly's transactions

36:31.101 --> 36:34.757
as related to the
shorting of Weeks stock.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.368
There's still
some connective tissue missing,

36:36.411 --> 36:38.021
but I think the evidence

36:38.065 --> 36:40.459
makes the defendant's intent
abundantly clear.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.983
Your Honor! Objection!Ms. Garfield,

36:43.026 --> 36:45.725

to cross-examine.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.814
Objection overruled.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.602
Now...

36:53.646 --> 36:57.258
according to the employees
at Weeks Dynamic,

36:57.302 --> 36:59.913
on the night
of James Weeks's death,

36:59.956 --> 37:01.871
you spent an hour with him...

37:01.915 --> 37:05.005
behind closed doors
in his office.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.703
Isn't that true?

37:09.270 --> 37:11.011
If they say so.

37:13.056 --> 37:16.451
And wasn't the purpose
of that visit, that time

37:16.495 --> 37:17.757

37:17.800 --> 37:21.064

physically excited?

37:21.108 --> 37:24.459

to trigger chest pains

37:24.503 --> 37:27.419

take his pill?

he was, top it off

37:30.204 --> 37:34.382

formulated hand sanitizer?

37:36.645 --> 37:40.997

found James Weeks naked?
