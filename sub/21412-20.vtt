00:01.729 --> 00:03.846
<i>No one is sure
what caused this outbreak,</i>

00:03.914 --> 00:06.395
<i>but recent data suggests
that nearly 90 percent</i>

00:06.463 --> 00:11.528
<i>of Manhattan Island appears
to have acquired... spider powers.</i>

00:12.112 --> 00:14.278
<i>And are New Yorkers upset?</i>

00:14.924 --> 00:18.690
<i>According to our sources,
most people are thrilled.</i>

00:18.994 --> 00:20.107
<i>Back to you, Bob.</i>

00:20.108 --> 00:23.463
So, yesterday, there were only
three people with spider powers...

00:23.601 --> 00:25.229
Me, Miles, and Gwen.

00:25.456 --> 00:28.216
Today... 1.5 million.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.260
What could possibly go wrong?

00:30.533 --> 00:33.268
Hey, watch where you're
sticking, buddy.

00:33.336 --> 00:35.127
People work in this building.

00:35.504 --> 00:37.754
A city full of amateur spider-men.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.549
This has gotta be Harry Osborn's
worst nightmare.

00:41.276 --> 00:43.205
Hey, Harry. It's Pete.

00:43.295 --> 00:45.344
Just wanted to check in
and see how you're dealing

00:45.411 --> 00:46.955
with all these spider people.

00:47.221 --> 00:50.268
Have you come down with any symptoms,
or is the mask still helping?

00:50.519 --> 00:51.596
Call me back.

00:55.758 --> 00:59.522
Don't worry. There's a professional
spider in the house. Huh?

01:00.133 --> 01:02.563
- Aahh!
- Spider-Gwen?

01:02.631 --> 01:05.801
Always gotta be careful when
you're webbing through the city.

01:06.531 --> 01:10.148
<i>- Oh, that's her!
- That's her!</i>

01:10.539 --> 01:13.984
Oh, come on. Now you're all
just embarrassing me.

01:17.334 --> 01:20.974
- There you are.
- It's official. Everyone loves you.

01:21.123 --> 01:25.357
- I feel like they barely tolerate me.
- It's your creepy costume.

01:25.508 --> 01:29.046
It's creepy? Oh, why?
Is the spandex too tight?

01:29.191 --> 01:31.802
Do red and blue clash?
I made the eyes too small, didn't I?

01:31.870 --> 01:35.951
Wow. Didn't realize I triggered
your spider-insecurities power.

01:36.038 --> 01:38.078
Whoa!
Huh.

01:38.146 --> 01:41.708
Seriously, a city full of spiders
is a recipe for disaster.

01:41.799 --> 01:43.920
Have a little
faith in New York.

01:43.995 --> 01:46.146
You and I turned these
powers into something good.

01:46.214 --> 01:47.654
Everyone else might too.

01:47.818 --> 01:52.217
Unless someone also has spider-jealousy
powers I didn't know about.

01:52.302 --> 01:56.408
I'm not jealous. It's just having
powers isn't all fun and games.

01:56.615 --> 02:00.834
It's not?
Relax, Spidey. Today's a beautiful day.

02:00.922 --> 02:03.021
I doubt there will be any big problems.

02:04.272 --> 02:07.021
Commenting on how there
won't be any big problems?

02:07.340 --> 02:09.104
Total rookie mistake.

02:12.287 --> 02:16.185
- Whoa! What hit that thing?
- I did, kid.

02:16.253 --> 02:18.724
The name's Crossbones.

02:18.792 --> 02:22.832
And that's what I call
a creepy costume.

02:29.021 --> 02:32.435
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDER-MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01   Episode 20</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Spider Island, Part 2"</font>

02:33.803 --> 02:35.820
There's no chance
this is all a misunderstanding,

02:35.888 --> 02:37.828
and that explosion
was an accident, right?

02:37.896 --> 02:40.506
Really?
The guy has a skull face.

02:40.655 --> 02:42.342
Eh, I don't want
to jump to conclusions.

02:42.410 --> 02:45.818
No kids in their pajamas
are gonna stop Crossbones.

02:45.886 --> 02:48.795
But I could use a good laugh
watching you try.

02:49.415 --> 02:52.631
- Conclusion officially jumped to.
- Let's do this, Spidey.

02:52.699 --> 02:55.599
No. You don't have enough
experience. Leave this to me.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.623
Did you forget we fought that
Stealth Spider guy together?

02:58.691 --> 03:00.443
But that was different. I...

03:01.140 --> 03:03.013
You both talk too much.

03:03.521 --> 03:06.545
Gwen, save that driver.
I'll distract Crossbones.

03:06.628 --> 03:09.045
Now, that sounds like a plan.

03:11.330 --> 03:12.678
Hey!

03:13.000 --> 03:17.248
- Huh?
- Have a nice... trip!

03:17.316 --> 03:18.835
Really?

03:19.110 --> 03:21.888
I think you got a little bacon
or something in your teeth.

03:22.146 --> 03:24.388
Trust me, I thought about
not saying anything.

03:25.451 --> 03:27.030
Let's get you outta here.

03:27.281 --> 03:32.041
Why'd everybody in this city
get spider powers 'cept me?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.880
Maybe you're a late bloomer.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.110
Whoa!

03:42.210 --> 03:44.353
You sure you still want me
to sit this one out?

03:44.670 --> 03:47.005
You know, sometimes
I say stupid things.

03:47.073 --> 03:51.064
Enough! No amateurs are gonna
keep me from taking what I want!

03:51.132 --> 03:54.361
"Amateurs"? I prefer
"exuberant young newcomers

03:54.429 --> 03:56.324
who are willing to give it
their best shot."

04:04.832 --> 04:06.997
Huh. Who you calling
"amateur" now?

04:10.271 --> 04:12.771
I'll tell you what,
getting around this city's never

04:12.839 --> 04:14.935
been easier now that
we got these webs.

04:15.045 --> 04:17.927
Same with arresting perps.
Thanks, Spider-Gwen.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.771
- Oh, and, uh, you, too, Spider-Man.
- Huh!

04:21.904 --> 04:27.107
Our work's done here.
No reason for us to "stick around."

04:27.576 --> 04:31.122
- Get it?
- Ho-ho! That's funny.

04:31.190 --> 04:34.154
Stealing my quips too.
Do I have anything left?

04:34.310 --> 04:36.444
Well, what's this?
Heavy.

04:36.514 --> 04:40.154
And this device looks like
it's made from... Vibranium?

04:40.484 --> 04:43.154
Whoa. This is
potentially dangerous.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.851
- Then we should...
- Take it to an expert.

04:46.726 --> 04:48.694
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

04:50.428 --> 04:52.858
Spider-Gwen, hold up!

04:55.093 --> 04:57.197
I was going to say,
"Take it to the police."

04:57.265 --> 04:59.665
You know, like a responsible
superhero would do.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.327
And where will the police take it?

05:01.395 --> 05:02.655
To Horizon, where we have

05:02.723 --> 05:05.562
one of the only Vibranium-scanning
microscopes in the world.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.171
If Crossbones wanted it,
it could be some kind of weapon.

05:08.257 --> 05:09.710
So time is of the essence.

05:09.778 --> 05:11.749
I'm just cutting out
the middleman.

05:11.817 --> 05:13.619
I still don't think
this is a good idea.

05:13.687 --> 05:15.384
Contaminating evidence and all that?

05:15.452 --> 05:17.392
When did you become such a wet blanket?

05:17.460 --> 05:18.540
Hey!

05:18.608 --> 05:21.447
First my costume's creepy,
and now I'm a wet blanket?

05:21.894 --> 05:24.490
Huh. Is that what people
really think of me?

05:25.063 --> 05:27.994
- Okay, I'll lead the way.
- Hmph. It's okay.

05:28.086 --> 05:29.845
I'm the one who goes to this school.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.017
Oh, yeah...
Right.

05:37.674 --> 05:40.119
That's Anya!
Something's wrong!

05:42.319 --> 05:45.166
Anya, are you okay?
Where are you?

05:45.234 --> 05:46.955
This is so weird.

05:47.023 --> 05:48.572
How do you live like this?

05:48.640 --> 05:52.642
Whoa!
This is the worst.

05:52.914 --> 05:55.689
Trust me, I had the
same problem at first.

05:55.773 --> 05:59.689
There was this whole pigeon situation...
that's better left unsaid.

05:59.916 --> 06:03.364
It's like learning to walk.
One foot and hand over the other.

06:03.618 --> 06:08.849
- Then relax and release.
- If you say so.

06:13.434 --> 06:17.496
Ow. This will take some getting used to.

06:17.613 --> 06:19.816
You always wanted
spider powers.

06:19.926 --> 06:23.793
Trust me, it'll be awesome.
We can all be like Spider-Man.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.461
Hooray.

06:26.269 --> 06:28.582
So, Anya,
we came across something,

06:28.650 --> 06:31.074
and you're the only expert I know.

06:31.215 --> 06:34.691
Huh.
This looks like pure Vibranium.

06:34.759 --> 06:37.009
Do you have any idea
how rare this is?

06:37.198 --> 06:39.646
As rare as having
spider powers used to be?

06:39.714 --> 06:41.535
Mm... mm...

06:41.870 --> 06:43.863
Ugh!

06:46.152 --> 06:47.862
Oops.

06:48.901 --> 06:51.230
A micro-encrypted key.

06:51.651 --> 06:55.160
The type used by high-security
government installations.

06:55.394 --> 06:57.582
We shouldn't even be touching it.

06:57.913 --> 06:59.160
Told ya.

06:59.402 --> 07:02.348
What... Hmm?

07:03.066 --> 07:04.734
<i>Ow!</i>

07:04.814 --> 07:07.053
- Huh?
- Come on!

07:11.654 --> 07:16.488
- I'll be taking this.
- Black Widow?

07:16.612 --> 07:19.871
Spider-Man.
Iron Man has a file on you.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.748
Says you have potential.
But all I'm seeing is a kid

07:22.816 --> 07:25.066
who stole high-security
government tech.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.464
It's not what it looks like!
We were trying to help!

07:27.531 --> 07:30.753
That Vibranium is a key.
What's it used for?

07:31.039 --> 07:33.264
We're in the process
of determining that.

07:33.344 --> 07:37.386
But this is Avengers' business.
Leave it up to the professionals.

07:42.648 --> 07:45.324
Don't move!
The key! Hand it over!

07:45.614 --> 07:48.964
Hydra agents?
Like, real, live Hydra agents?

07:49.044 --> 07:54.621
- This is seriously bad, right?
- Hydra's formidable, but so am I.

07:54.711 --> 07:57.881
Do you goons seriously believe
you can handle me?

07:58.046 --> 08:01.831
It seems you're missing some intel.
Hydra's got some upgrades.

08:01.899 --> 08:05.539
Hydra too?
Is anyone not a spider?

08:07.000 --> 08:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:16.902 --> 08:19.339
The Avengers can make
some pretty solid handcuffs,

08:19.504 --> 08:22.644
but a little spider strength
should do the trick.

08:33.128 --> 08:34.464
How do you...

08:34.532 --> 08:38.552
- This is not as easy as I thought it'd be.
- Don't worry.

08:38.938 --> 08:41.438
- Aahh!
- I'll train you on the fly.

08:41.518 --> 08:43.289
Or, you know, on the spider.

08:43.357 --> 08:47.211
- Is making stupid jokes part of it?
- No.

08:48.602 --> 08:52.102
Lesson one: Use your
environment to your advantage.

08:52.948 --> 08:55.516
Office equipment! Take that!

08:56.742 --> 08:58.656
Eat desk!

08:59.672 --> 09:01.553
Is that using your environment?

09:01.656 --> 09:05.469
A whole desk? You seem to
have spider strength down.

09:05.737 --> 09:06.886
Hmm!

09:14.554 --> 09:15.992
Get that key!

09:16.266 --> 09:19.071
Crossbones will be pleased with...

09:19.328 --> 09:22.188
With what?
Your failure?

09:22.256 --> 09:26.336
Check it, Anya! Spiders can
use every surface.

09:27.273 --> 09:30.399
See that web shot?
It's all in the wrist.

09:30.923 --> 09:32.012
I'm open!

09:35.118 --> 09:37.969
Anya, you're up!
Keep away!

09:41.683 --> 09:44.586
Black Widow is down,

09:44.782 --> 09:47.097
and you amateurs
are no match for...

09:47.248 --> 09:50.586
- Wow! It is all in the wrist.
- Told ya.

09:50.742 --> 09:53.008
That's it! Destroy them!

09:54.884 --> 09:56.241
What?

09:56.309 --> 09:58.702
There's no way she could...

10:03.699 --> 10:08.629
- She is so amazing!
- And even stronger than I thought.

10:15.879 --> 10:19.020
Oh, that explains it.
She's now Spider-Black Widow.

10:19.137 --> 10:20.882
That seems a little redundant.

10:20.973 --> 10:23.621
You say redundant,
I say awesome!

10:23.879 --> 10:26.324
I know it's a little confusing at first,
but

10:26.392 --> 10:27.965
since I'm kind of the only

10:28.033 --> 10:31.207
spider power expert in the world,
let me show you how to...

10:48.163 --> 10:50.043
Aahh!

10:54.327 --> 10:56.831
I think I got the hang of it.

10:58.276 --> 11:02.268
- Yeah. Guess so.
- What do we do now?

11:03.084 --> 11:05.687
We get some information.

11:07.925 --> 11:10.612
What? Where am I?

11:10.697 --> 11:13.807
I'll be asking the questions
here, dirtbag.

11:14.072 --> 11:17.471
Time for you to sing like a canary.

11:18.868 --> 11:22.003
- What are you doing?
- An interrogation.

11:22.143 --> 11:25.148
Don't worry.
I've seen tons of cop shows.

11:25.253 --> 11:29.243
Answer me, or this'll go
on your permanent record!

11:29.311 --> 11:32.639
Uh, he can't answer if you
haven't asked any questions.

11:32.707 --> 11:35.139
Hydra agents
are international criminals.

11:35.207 --> 11:36.405
I doubt they care about

11:36.473 --> 11:38.577
- their permanent records.
- Oh.

11:38.725 --> 11:41.419
I guess spider-interrogation
isn't a power.

11:44.058 --> 11:46.742
Okay.
I'll tell you everything.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.381
Really?

11:48.472 --> 11:50.389
Okay.
What's the key for?

11:50.596 --> 11:53.394
It goes to the National
Vibranium Reserve.

11:53.586 --> 11:55.806
Why does Crossbones need
that much Vibranium?

11:55.874 --> 11:57.634
I... I don't know.

11:57.702 --> 12:01.014
But with everybody in the city
getting powers, it's chaos.

12:01.131 --> 12:04.194
He hatched a plan to rob
the vault in all the confusion.

12:04.295 --> 12:07.514
See? I'm not such a bad
interrogator after all.

12:07.662 --> 12:11.465
- I've seen worse.
- How long were you standing there?

12:13.409 --> 12:14.792
During secure missions,

12:14.860 --> 12:17.292
Hydra operates under
strict radio silence.

12:17.432 --> 12:20.089
The rest of Hydra won't know
Crossbones got caught,

12:20.203 --> 12:21.761
and they'll still head for the vault.

12:21.829 --> 12:24.042
So if we beat them there,
we can set a trap!

12:24.221 --> 12:27.487
- "We"?
- Sure. You can totally come.

12:27.555 --> 12:29.315
I don't think that's what
she meant, Spidey.

12:29.383 --> 12:33.161
- I think she's planning on a solo mission.
- Oh, come on!

12:33.229 --> 12:36.788
We were the ones that took down
Crossbones and got the key.

12:36.868 --> 12:40.344
Let us be your backup.
You might actually need some help.

12:41.253 --> 12:43.737
Fine. But I call the shots.

12:44.050 --> 12:46.057
Also, someone stays here
to keep an eye

12:46.167 --> 12:48.216
on these Hydra troops
until they can be taken in.

12:48.284 --> 12:51.659
I'll do that. These spider powers
are still weirding me out.

12:51.768 --> 12:54.718
I need more practice
before I battle Hydra again.

12:54.932 --> 12:57.063
I guess we're leaving.

12:59.026 --> 13:02.510
Believe it or not,
this is my first vault break-in.

13:03.011 --> 13:06.078
But I've broken into prison before,
so I can handle this.

13:06.236 --> 13:08.229
Don't worry about me, Wido...

13:16.135 --> 13:18.054
<i>Trust me, he'll be here.</i>

13:18.211 --> 13:21.651
<i>The boss'll make sure Crossbones
is never heard from again.</i>

13:21.901 --> 13:24.674
Okay, our plan to beat
Hydra here is a big fail.

13:24.854 --> 13:26.979
- Now what?
- Change of tactics.

13:27.088 --> 13:28.706
They mentioned a boss.

13:28.893 --> 13:32.838
Hydra clearly has a bigger plan in play.
We need more surveillance.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.831
I bet your spy phone
is loaded with games, huh?

13:35.906 --> 13:38.460
'Cause spying seems like
a lot of boring waiting.

13:38.582 --> 13:41.268
If you consider saving the world boring.

13:41.369 --> 13:42.838
Fair enough.

13:43.023 --> 13:47.010
Believe me, espionage
is never dull for very long.

13:51.143 --> 13:52.807
Look out!

13:55.190 --> 13:58.573
Crossbones with spider powers?
That's kind of unfair.

13:58.698 --> 14:02.174
You were right, Spider-Brat.
I was a late bloomer.

14:02.289 --> 14:05.010
Those cops found out
the hard way.

14:08.438 --> 14:11.104
I got him.
You two handle the others.

14:11.159 --> 14:12.995
- Others?
- Hail Hydra!

14:13.081 --> 14:17.169
Like they say, it's not a party until
the spider-powered evil army arrives!

14:20.968 --> 14:24.743
Level playing field.
How's it feel to be like everyone else?

14:24.912 --> 14:27.204
Can't say I'm a big fan.

14:37.508 --> 14:41.579
One of these targets took the
Vibranium vault key. Get it!

14:42.609 --> 14:45.194
- Pull a stall-drop.
- A what-what?

14:45.293 --> 14:47.071
I left my spy dictionary at home.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.459
We take a dive.
Follow my lead.

14:49.570 --> 14:52.336
She wants us to lose?
On purpose?

14:52.472 --> 14:54.412
That idea sounds...

14:55.086 --> 14:57.857
How do you say...
terrible.

15:04.469 --> 15:06.341
Aah!

15:06.475 --> 15:09.341
Not the first time I've had
an Avenger at my feet.

15:09.479 --> 15:11.787
And it won't be the last.

15:11.988 --> 15:16.279
Uh, without Black Widow,
what are we going to do?!

15:16.411 --> 15:21.849
Uh... she was our leader!
We surrender.

15:22.193 --> 15:26.435
Here we go,
the key to Hydra's plans,

15:26.744 --> 15:28.841
and to my fat bank account.

15:28.990 --> 15:33.396
Thanks for bringing this back.
Very helpful of you.

15:36.646 --> 15:39.638
That's even more Vibranium
than the boss thought.

15:39.826 --> 15:42.959
This job just keeps getting better.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.039
<i>What do you plan
to do with us, Crossbones?</i>

15:58.119 --> 16:02.466
Two teenage heroes... fine.
But a captured Avenger too?

16:02.591 --> 16:06.974
I'm expecting a pretty rich bonus
for throwing you into the deal.

16:09.982 --> 16:11.724
Why'd you bring the key?

16:11.834 --> 16:13.896
Aren't you supposed to be
some kind of expert?

16:14.021 --> 16:16.922
I've been a hero, like, five months,
and I already know... bad idea.

16:16.990 --> 16:20.443
Because now Crossbones is giving
us a free ride to his leader.

16:20.685 --> 16:22.740
And I need to know who it is.

16:22.959 --> 16:25.304
It's Hydra.
We already know that.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.560
- But which faction?
- There are different factions?

16:28.732 --> 16:31.452
We bust this unit,
another one just pops up.

16:31.607 --> 16:34.794
But we bust the guy at the top,
the whole plan fails,

16:34.888 --> 16:37.568
and the world becomes a safer place.

16:40.603 --> 16:43.709
- I didn't think about it like that.
- It's okay.

16:44.325 --> 16:46.802
You're still new at this.

16:58.444 --> 17:03.959
Okay! That guy totally has
a TV face in his body.

17:04.185 --> 17:05.794
I am so out of my league.

17:05.990 --> 17:09.176
Arnim Zola.
Now we know.

17:09.347 --> 17:14.090
<i>Oh, I see you've led my troops
to victory, Crossbones.</i>

17:14.271 --> 17:16.201
Pure Vibranium.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.935
You'll finally be able to forge

17:18.044 --> 17:20.076
the unbreakable weapons
you've been designing.

17:20.144 --> 17:22.795
So, naturally,
this won't be cheap.

17:22.900 --> 17:26.630
Look at that. Your plan worked.
Now can we fight?

17:26.755 --> 17:29.309
I like how you think.

17:36.297 --> 17:38.806
Sorry to break up this party, Zola.

17:38.876 --> 17:41.564
- Sorry, not sorry!
- Crossbones...

17:41.686 --> 17:44.267
Don't worry. I'll contain them.
Hydra!

17:57.988 --> 18:00.145
Nice try.

18:21.235 --> 18:22.516
Aah!

18:22.680 --> 18:24.409
I gotcha!

18:24.444 --> 18:27.019
Or not!

18:27.099 --> 18:30.769
You're done!

18:32.129 --> 18:35.449
Surrounded or not, we won't
make it easy on you, Zola.

18:36.254 --> 18:41.613
<i>A pitiful attempt by
a pitiful group of...</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:46.082
- You mess with one spider...
- You mess with all of them!

18:54.516 --> 18:57.914
- What's going on here?
- We saw footage from the news chopper.

18:58.078 --> 18:59.438
We knew you were in trouble.

18:59.531 --> 19:02.377
You webbed my daughter out of the
way of a speeding car, Spidey.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.977
You saved her life.

19:04.139 --> 19:06.391
And you pulled me
from a burning building.

19:06.523 --> 19:09.891
Now that we have powers, too,
it's time we paid you back.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.656
They like me.
They really like me!

19:14.076 --> 19:17.016
Spiders, let's do this!

19:20.729 --> 19:24.511
Hey, Hydra, guess I've
got a team now too!

19:28.658 --> 19:31.074
<i>Hydra, retreat!</i>

19:34.319 --> 19:37.373
- Huh?
- You ruined a big score for me.

19:37.561 --> 19:41.099
Hands off! That's our
friendly neighborhood hero.

19:42.925 --> 19:45.387
I can take down...

19:52.762 --> 19:55.130
Now who talks
too much, Bonehead?

19:55.267 --> 19:57.989
Your fan club managed to
capture the Hydra troops

19:58.057 --> 20:00.817
that didn't escape with Zola.
Nice work.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.106
<i>- Yeah!
- Yes!</i>

20:07.699 --> 20:09.567
I don't know how to thank you all.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.184
Thank us?
We should thank you.

20:12.286 --> 20:15.341
With everyone getting powers,
you're more important than ever.

20:15.466 --> 20:18.419
You showed us all
this isn't scary or weird.

20:18.606 --> 20:20.903
We actually could be heroes.

20:21.145 --> 20:23.029
<i>- Yeah!
- Yes!</i>

20:23.239 --> 20:26.005
I'll admit it.
I'm impressed.

20:26.723 --> 20:30.648
For accidentally stumbling into victory?
'Cause I'm very good at that.

20:30.716 --> 20:32.622
For inspiring people.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.600
Stark told me we should
keep an eye on you.

20:35.765 --> 20:39.177
I'm surprised to say...
I agree.

20:45.067 --> 20:46.723
<i>- Yeah!
- Up here!</i>

20:46.791 --> 20:49.557
You know, you were right, Gwen.
This is a good thing.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.262
- I knew you'd come around.
- Help me!

20:52.544 --> 20:54.083
Help!

20:55.950 --> 20:58.520
Looks like a job for
your Friendly Neighborhood...

20:58.700 --> 21:02.200
Spider-Gwen.
How about you take this one?

21:02.473 --> 21:04.387
No problem.

21:06.059 --> 21:09.184
You know, maybe an island
full of spider people

21:09.277 --> 21:11.576
isn't gonna be as bad as I thought.

21:12.776 --> 21:14.026
Here ya go, ma'am.

21:14.126 --> 21:16.872
Ohhh!

21:19.309 --> 21:23.192
Another day, another victory.
I could get used to this.

21:23.700 --> 21:27.802
What?
Something's happening...
