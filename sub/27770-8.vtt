00:02.310 --> 00:02.793
>> Julie: TOM HOLDS THE H.O.H.

00:02.827 --> 00:03.586
POWER.

00:03.620 --> 00:06.275
TAMAR HOLDS A SECRET POWER.

00:06.310 --> 00:10.103
BUT IT'S YET TO BE DETERMINED
WHO HOLDS THE POWER TO DETERMINE

00:10.137 --> 00:11.206
TONIGHT'S LIVE EVICTION.

00:11.241 --> 00:16.137
WELCOME TO "CELEBRITY BIG

00:19.896 --> 00:26.034
TERRIFYING BATTLE FOR POWER, THE
COMMODIAN MURDERED THE

00:26.068 --> 00:31.241
COMPETITION.

00:31.275 --> 00:34.862
>> NOW WE'RE GOING TO DECIMATE
THIS HOUSE.

00:34.896 --> 00:39.241
NO, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

00:39.275 --> 00:41.241
I SHOULDN'T LET POWER GO TO MY
HEAD LIKE THAT.

00:41.275 --> 00:45.034
>> Announcer: TOM, LOLO,
NATALIE, AND KATO TRIED TO

00:45.068 --> 00:46.758
STRENGTHEN THEIR RANKS BY
RECRUITING RICKY.

00:46.793 --> 00:48.275
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

00:48.310 --> 00:53.137
>> DO YOU WANT AN ALLIANCE WHICH
MAKES SENSE?

00:53.172 --> 00:56.068
>> Announcer: BUT WHEN THE
FOOTBALL PLAYER SEEMED

00:56.103 --> 00:57.586
WISHY-WASHY, TOM GREW
SUSPICIOUS.

00:57.620 --> 01:00.517
>> SO DO WE WANT A NAME OR WHAT?

01:00.551 --> 01:02.034
>> NO, NO NAMES.

01:02.068 --> 01:04.827
>> NO NAMES?

01:04.862 --> 01:08.517
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN OUR
ALLIANCE, THEN MAYBE WE DON'T

01:08.551 --> 01:12.172
WANT YOU TO BE IN OUR ALLIANCE,
SO THERE, RICKY WILLIAMS.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.344
>> Announcer: AND HE
CONSIDERED TAKING HIM OUT.

01:14.379 --> 01:20.137
>> IF WE HAVE FIVE, WE CANNOT
MATHMATICALLY LOSE.

01:20.172 --> 01:22.724
>> PROVIDED RICKY DOESN'T DOUBLE
CROSS US.

01:22.758 --> 01:24.482
WHAT ABOUT YOU, RICKY.

01:24.517 --> 01:25.862
WHAT ABOUT YOU, RICKY.

01:25.896 --> 01:29.034
>> Announcer: TAMAR WON A NEW
SECRET POWER.

01:29.068 --> 01:34.896
>> IF YOU GET NOMINATED AT THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY OR VETO

01:34.931 --> 01:36.344
MEETING, YOU CAN USE THIS POWER
TO PULL YOURSELF OFF THE

01:36.379 --> 01:39.172
CHOPPING BLOCK, KEEPING YOURSELF
SAFE AT THE NEXT EVICTION.

01:39.206 --> 01:43.655
>> BUT THINKING KANDI OR JOEY
HAS IT --

01:43.689 --> 01:52.034
>> THE PERSON IN THE STICKEST
SITUATION HAS IT.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.482
>> Announcer: TOM NOMINATED
THEM TO FLUSH IT OUT.

01:54.517 --> 01:57.689
>> HOPEFULLY I HAVEN'T PUT YOU
IN A STICKY SITUATION.

01:57.724 --> 02:00.965
>> Announcer: WHO WILL BE THE
NEXT CELEBRITY SENT PACKING?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.034
PLUS WITH BACKSTABS AND
BETRAYALS UNDER WAY, ALLIANCES

02:04.068 --> 02:04.758
CRUMBLE.

02:04.793 --> 02:07.689
>> YOU GOING CRAZY, TOM.

02:07.724 --> 02:11.689
DON'T GO DEFCOM AGAIN.

02:11.724 --> 02:13.034
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS AGAIN.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.172
>> Announcer: ALL THIS LIVE ON
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

02:15.206 --> 02:20.448
>> OH, HELL NO.

02:20.482 --> 02:25.137
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING.

02:25.172 --> 02:27.241
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

02:27.275 --> 02:33.103
WELCOME TO "CELEBRITY BIG
BROTHER."

02:33.137 --> 02:35.103
IT'S DAY 18 INSIDE THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE.

02:35.137 --> 02:38.206
WE'RE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY
FROM CROWNING THE WINNER OF

02:38.241 --> 02:40.103
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

02:40.137 --> 02:44.103
BUT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF GAME
TO BE PLAYED, BEGINNING WITH

02:44.137 --> 02:47.551
TONIGHT'S VETO COMPETITION, VETO
MEETING, AND LIVE VOTE AND

02:47.586 --> 02:48.965
EVICTION.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.034
TO WHEN THE DUST SETTLES
TONIGHT, WHO WILL END UP ON THE

02:52.068 --> 02:54.103
BLOCK?

02:54.137 --> 02:57.103
AND WHO WILL SURVIVE THE NIGHT,
INCHING THAT MUCH CLOSER TO THE

02:57.137 --> 03:00.103
$250,000 GRAND PRIZE?

03:00.137 --> 03:01.655
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

03:01.689 --> 03:07.068
BUT FIRST, POWER CAN GET YOU FAR
IN THIS GAME, BUT PARANOIA CAN

03:07.103 --> 03:09.206
DESTROY YOU.

03:09.241 --> 03:16.068
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

03:16.103 --> 03:17.413
>> LET'S DO IT.

03:17.448 --> 03:20.620
>> I'M ON THE BLOCK TWO TIMES.

03:20.655 --> 03:21.758
AIN'T THAT SOMETHING.

03:21.793 --> 03:23.206
>> LOOK AT THIS FOOL.

03:23.241 --> 03:25.034
I HAVE THE POWER.

03:25.068 --> 03:25.689
PING.

03:25.724 --> 03:27.344
AND YOU GOT IT WRONG.

03:27.379 --> 03:31.068
I THINK THAT YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDS ARE IDIOTS.

03:31.103 --> 03:33.931
HOW ABOUT THAT?

03:33.965 --> 03:36.034
BOOM SHAKLAKA.

03:36.068 --> 03:40.896
>> THAT IS THE DUMBEST REASON
I'VE EVER HEARD FOR SOMEBODY

03:40.931 --> 03:41.689
PUTTING SOMEBODY ON THE BLOCK.

03:41.724 --> 03:44.000
HOW DID I GET PUT ON THE BLOCK?

03:44.034 --> 03:48.137
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL STUPID WHEN
YOU DON'T SEE I DON'T HAVE THE

03:48.172 --> 03:49.655
SUPERPOWER.

03:49.689 --> 03:52.931
WHEN WIN THIS VETO, TOM BETTER
WATCH OUT, BECAUSE NOW HE HAS

03:52.965 --> 03:58.482
ANOTHER PERSON WHO IS NOT A FAN
OF HIS.

03:58.517 --> 04:01.068
ANYWAY, WHATEVER.

04:01.103 --> 04:06.137
>> SO I PUT JOEY AND KANDI ON
THE BLOCK, AND I'M EXPECTING

04:06.172 --> 04:09.862
SOMEBODY TO STAND UP AND SAY
THEY HAVE THE POWER, BUT NOTHING

04:09.896 --> 04:17.551
HAPPEN, SO NOW I'M CONFUSED, BUT
MY GOAL IS TO BACKDOOR RICK KIM

04:17.586 --> 04:21.689
MAYBE TODAY WE CAN PLAY MURDER
MYSTERY THEATER HERE IN THE

04:21.724 --> 04:22.482
HOUSE WHOM HAS THE POWER.

04:22.517 --> 04:24.310
>> HONEST TO GOD, I DON'T HAVE
IT.

04:24.344 --> 04:27.689
>> AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT GETTING
BACKDOORED.

04:27.724 --> 04:29.137
>> NOMINATED AGAIN.

04:29.172 --> 04:30.344
I TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.

04:30.379 --> 04:35.034
YOU WANT PEOPLE OUT OF HERE WHO
YOU DEEM IS A THREAT.

04:35.068 --> 04:39.034
THEY STARTED WITH JONATHAN, WENT
TO RYAN, AND THEY'RE FOCUSING ON

04:39.068 --> 04:40.620
ME NOW.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.000
WHEN THAT GROUP CANNIBALIZES ON
EACH OTHER, THAT WILL BE FUN FOR

04:43.034 --> 04:50.862
EVERYBODY TO WATCH, BECAUSE IT'S
INEVITABLE.

04:50.896 --> 04:55.758
>> IF YOU HAVE THE POWER, I AM
GOING TO BE PISSED, YOU TOO,

04:55.793 --> 04:56.172
RICKY.

04:56.206 --> 04:57.448
>> I DON'T.

04:57.482 --> 04:58.965
>> AT THIS POINT WE'VE GOT AN
AGREEMENT, RIGHT?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.793
>> WE SHOULD BE HONEST.

05:01.827 --> 05:04.517
>> 100% I DON'T HAVE IT.

05:04.551 --> 05:05.172
100% YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

05:05.206 --> 05:07.517
>> I THINK IT'S TAMAR.

05:07.551 --> 05:09.034
HER BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED.

05:09.068 --> 05:11.517
I NOTICED SHE'S ACTING A LITTLE
BIT DIFFERENT.

05:11.551 --> 05:12.827
>> TRUE.

05:12.862 --> 05:16.000
>> I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
TAMAR HAS THE POWER.

05:16.034 --> 05:18.034
I THINK IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT
RICKY HAS IT.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.551
I'M DOING A LITTLE
INVESTIGATION.

05:19.586 --> 05:28.413
CALL ME SHERLOCK TOM.

05:28.448 --> 05:29.379
>> HEY, TOM.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.551
>> HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

05:31.586 --> 05:34.724
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO HAS
THE POWER.

05:34.758 --> 05:35.586
WHAT'S UP?

05:35.620 --> 05:38.379
LOOK WHO IT IS.

05:38.413 --> 05:40.413
OH, HEY.

05:40.448 --> 05:44.655
WE DON'T THINK JOEY HAS THE
POWER BECAUSE NOBODY IS THAT

05:44.689 --> 05:46.965
GOOD OF AN ACTOR.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.896
>> BUT YOU FOR SURE THINK IT'S
NO ONE FROM THE FUN?

05:55.931 --> 05:58.862
>> I SURE HOPE NOT.

05:58.896 --> 05:59.551
>> HUH?

05:59.586 --> 06:01.034
>> I SURE HOPE NOT.

06:01.068 --> 06:04.034
>> ARE YOU GETTING THIS CRAZY,
TOM?

06:04.068 --> 06:06.379
WE JUST WON A HELL OF AN
ALLIANCE.

06:06.413 --> 06:07.931
DON'T GO DEFCOM.

06:07.965 --> 06:12.275
THIS IS WHY I CANNOT WORK WITH
TAY.

06:12.310 --> 06:13.965
SHE IS EMOTIONAL AND PARANOID.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.551
YOU GO TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE
PARANOID.

06:16.586 --> 06:18.068
THAT'S WHEN WE START TO
DISMANTLE.

06:18.103 --> 06:21.620
I'M NOT DOWN FOR THAT, IF YOU
WANT TO DO THAT, TOM, I DON'T

06:21.655 --> 06:22.310
PLAY THAT GAME.

06:22.344 --> 06:23.413
>> WHAT IS OUR ALLIANCE.

06:23.448 --> 06:25.137
>> YOU KNOW OUR ALLIANCE.

06:25.172 --> 06:26.310
OUR ALLIANCE IS FIVE.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.758
WE ARE WORKING WITH RICKY.

06:27.793 --> 06:29.931
YOU KEEP QUESTIONING THAT -- NO,
STOP.

06:29.965 --> 06:30.931
THIS NEEDS TO BE OUT.

06:30.965 --> 06:32.758
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING
ON.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.827
>> WHAT IS GOING ON?

06:33.862 --> 06:34.758
>> NO YELLING.

06:34.793 --> 06:36.724
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU RILED
UP.

06:36.758 --> 06:40.413
I THINK RICKY HAS THE POWER.

06:40.448 --> 06:44.172
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET TO FINAL
FIVE AND THEN HE WANTS TO PICK A

06:44.206 --> 06:46.000
SIDE AND HE WANTS TO DESTROY THE
OTHER SIDE.

06:46.034 --> 06:49.551
>> WHETHER OR NOT RICKY HAS THE
POWER, I FEEL LIKE RICKY IS

06:49.586 --> 06:52.551
TRYING TO RIDE THIS ALLIANCE
WAVE UNTIL THE END AND THEN

06:52.586 --> 06:54.034
DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

06:54.068 --> 06:56.827
I NEED TO CONVINCE LOLO AND
NATALIE THAT RICKY SHOULDN'T BE

06:56.862 --> 07:01.103
IN OUR ALLIANCE, THAT WE NEED TO
BACKDOOR HIM NOW.

07:01.137 --> 07:04.206
IF I PUT RICKY ON THE BLOCK, WE
CAN SEND HIM HOME.

07:04.241 --> 07:08.689
IF WE'RE WRONG, SORRY, RICKY,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE POWER, YOU

07:08.724 --> 07:10.034
WEREN'T WORKING AGAINST US.

07:10.068 --> 07:12.137
>> TOM IS THEMOST PARANOID
PLAYER NOW.

07:12.172 --> 07:13.655
WHY GET RID OF RICKY NOW.

07:13.689 --> 07:17.724
WE CAN STILL USE HIM FOR NUMBERS
AND GET A FEW MORE PEOPLE OUT,

07:17.758 --> 07:20.448
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION.

07:20.482 --> 07:24.344
>> I HAVE THE POWER AND WE SEND
HIM HOME.

07:24.379 --> 07:34.827
>> FAIR.

07:34.862 --> 07:37.068
>> I'M NOT PLAYING THAT GAME.

07:37.103 --> 07:42.931
LIKE I REALLY DON'T GIVE A
[BLEEPED] ABOUT IT.

07:42.965 --> 07:45.758
>> WHO THINKS THAT I HAVE IT?

07:45.793 --> 07:49.344
>> IT'S TOM.

07:49.379 --> 07:53.103
MY ALLEGIANCE IS ALWAYS WITH
PEOPLE WHO LOOK OUT FOR ME.

07:53.137 --> 07:57.413
EARLY ON RICKY DID ME A SOLID BY
WARNING ME ABOUT RYAN

07:57.448 --> 07:59.689
POTENTIALLY BACKDOORING ME.

07:59.724 --> 08:07.103
SO I KIND OF WANT TO RETURN THE
FAVOR.

08:07.137 --> 08:12.965
>> FOR TOM TO BACKDOOR US --
>> BASICALLY IT'S LIKE THIS, TOM

08:26.517 --> 08:27.965
IS RUNNING AROUND CRAZY.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.827
>> IT WAS SO COLD I SAW A PIGEON
RUNNING INTO KENNY ROGER'S

08:34.862 --> 08:36.793
ROASTERS TO SURRENDER.

08:36.827 --> 08:39.586
I UNDERSTAND THE LONG GAME, I
REALLY DO, BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

08:39.620 --> 08:42.620
TO PLAY IT FOR LIKE GAME BY
GAME.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.931
THE PLAN THAT TOM WANTS TO
BACKDOOR RICKY DOES NOT BENEFIT

08:45.965 --> 08:47.689
ME AT ALL.

08:47.724 --> 08:49.241
LIKE ZERO.

08:49.275 --> 08:54.620
SO NOW I'M WONDERING IF IT'S THE
RIGHT MOVE TO WORK WITH TOM AND

08:54.655 --> 08:58.517
KATO?

08:58.551 --> 09:01.620
>> WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE SAME
PAGE.

09:01.655 --> 09:05.206
>> HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

09:05.241 --> 09:07.965
WE GOT TO AT LEAST PRETEND LIKE
THE FIVE OF US ARE STILL

09:08.000 --> 09:09.034
TOGETHER.

09:09.068 --> 09:15.000
IF WE WIN THE VETO, DON'T CHANGE
ANYTHING.

09:15.034 --> 09:19.172
>> AGREED.

09:19.206 --> 09:22.655
>> IS THIS THING ON?

09:22.689 --> 09:25.517
>> Julie: UP NEXT, IT'S THE
POWER OF VETO COMPETITION.

09:25.551 --> 09:29.586
WHO WILL WIN IT, AND WILL IT BE
USED TO SAVE ONE OF THE

09:29.620 --> 09:30.655
NOMINEES?

09:30.689 --> 09:31.655
THEN IT'S THE LIVE VOTE AND
EVICTION.

09:31.689 --> 09:33.689
WHICH CELEBRITY WILL BE SHOWN
THE FRONT DOOR.

09:33.724 --> 09:37.758
AND DON'T FORGET, YOU CAN WATCH
THE CELEBRITIES 24/7 ON THE "BIG

09:37.793 --> 09:41.034

09:44.000 --> 09:45.310

10:01.206 --> 10:05.344

"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

10:05.379 --> 10:08.344
IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE POWER OF
VETO COMPETITION.

10:08.379 --> 10:13.344
TOM, JOEY, AND KANDI, ALONG WITH
LOLO, NATALIE EVA MARIE, AND

10:13.379 --> 10:15.344
DINA WERE CHOSE ON THE PLAY BY
RANDOM DRAW.

10:15.379 --> 10:18.896
THEY WILL NOW GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
FOR THE CHANCE TO CHANGE THE

10:18.931 --> 10:27.896
NOMINATIONS OR KEEP THEM IN
PLACE.

10:27.931 --> 10:34.379
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
>> WELCOME TO THE BIG GAME.

10:34.413 --> 10:37.965
TO BRING HOME THE VETO, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE THE FIGHT OFF THAT

10:38.000 --> 10:41.931
NAUSEOUS FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH
AND KNOCK DOWN PRESSURE FIELD

10:41.965 --> 10:43.206
KICKS TO WIN THE GAME.

10:43.241 --> 10:46.379
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: THE GOAL IN
EACH BATTLE IS TO MAKE THREE

10:46.413 --> 10:49.551
FIELD GOALS BEFORE YOUR
OPPONENT.

10:49.586 --> 10:54.068
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, A LINEBACKER
IS IN POSITION TO BLOCK YOUR

10:54.103 --> 10:55.551
KICKS.

10:55.586 --> 10:59.034
TO KNOCK THE LINEBACKER DOWN,
HOLD YOUR HANDLE AND SPIN 15

10:59.068 --> 11:00.310
TIMES.

11:00.344 --> 11:02.620
THE BLOCKER WILL LOWER FOR SEVEN
SECONDS.

11:02.655 --> 11:05.620
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO KICK THE
FIELD GOAL.

11:05.655 --> 11:09.482
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE FAST
BECAUSE AFTER SEVEN SECONDS THE

11:09.517 --> 11:13.275
LINEMAN WILL POP BACK UP, AND
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPIN AGAIN TO GET

11:13.310 --> 11:14.896
ANOTHER ATTEMPT.

11:14.931 --> 11:19.241
THE FIRST PLAYER TO SUCCESSFULLY
KICK THREE FIELD GOALS WILL WIN

11:19.275 --> 11:21.137
THE BATTLE AND ELIMINATE THEIR
OPPONENT.

11:21.172 --> 11:25.103
THE LAST PLAYER STANDING WILL
WIN THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

11:25.137 --> 11:30.448
WHO IS READY TO PLAY KICK THE
COMPETITION?

11:30.482 --> 11:33.241
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
I WILL NOW DRAW NAMES TO

11:33.275 --> 11:35.275
DETERMINE THE IN ORDER IN WHICH
YOU WILL COMPETE.

11:35.310 --> 11:44.034
THE FIRST NAME IS LOLO.

11:44.068 --> 11:47.793
JOEY.

11:47.827 --> 11:48.482
TOM.

11:48.517 --> 11:49.827

12:04.068 --> 12:06.034
>> BEING ON THE BLOCK IS
STRESSFUL.

12:06.068 --> 12:07.517
OKAY.

12:07.551 --> 12:10.896
AND IF I HAVE TO JUST SPIN
AROUND AND KICK A FIELD GOAL TO

12:10.931 --> 12:16.379
GET OFF THE BLOCK, THEN THAT'S
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

12:16.413 --> 12:20.517
>> NATALIE EVA MARIE.

12:20.551 --> 12:25.344

BENEFICIAL FOR MY GAME, SO NOW

IT'S UP TO ONE OF US TO WIN SO
THAT WE HAVE THE POWER.

RICKY HAS DONE NOTHING BUT LOOK

12:52.000 --> 12:56.793
WE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT TOM, DINA,
OR KANDI, MIGHT AS WELL START

12:56.827 --> 12:57.517

I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO
DO WITH THE VETO.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.034
IT'S GOING TO TELL ME SOMETHING
ABOUT WHERE THEIR LOYALTIES LIE.

HAVING WON THE VETO, NATALIE EVA
MARIE MUST NOW DECIDE, USE IT

AND GO THROUGH WITH TOM'S PLAN
TO BACKDOOR RICKY, OR KEEP IT

AROUND CER NECK AND DRAW A LINE
IN THE SAND.

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH
THE VETO, NATALIE?

22:06.413 --> 22:18.344

IF THEY STAYED THE COURSE WITH
THE FINAL FIVE THAT WE

22:54.241 --> 22:56.103
ORIGINALLY HAD, EVERYTHING WOULD
HAVE BEEN COOL.

22:56.137 --> 22:57.896
>> OH, MY GOD.

VETO.

23:14.758 --> 23:16.965

SURPRISED.

I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE DECEIVING US
NOW.

23:18.931 --> 23:19.896
I'M SURE OF IT.

23:19.931 --> 23:20.931
I CAN SEE ACTING.

23:20.965 --> 23:23.068

DECEPTIVE.

23:23.103 --> 23:24.413
GOOD JOB, NATALIE.

23:24.448 --> 23:26.034

VETO, BUT NOW WE NEED TO COVER

23:34.896 --> 23:36.344
OUR TRACKS.

23:36.379 --> 23:39.068
NATALIE AND LOLO HAVE TO PUT ON
THEIR BEST ACTING FACES AND

23:39.103 --> 23:49.068
CONVINCE KATO AND TOM THAT WE'RE
STILL A GROUP.

23:49.103 --> 23:51.793
>> HELLO.

24:00.896 --> 24:02.931
>> I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU
GUYS WERE.

24:02.965 --> 24:06.896
>> YOU GUYS NEVER SAID WHAT WE
WERE DOING.

24:06.931 --> 24:10.758
>> THAT'S WHY I WAS SURPRISED
YOU DID IT WITHOUT TALKING TO

24:10.793 --> 24:12.034
US, BUT IT'S ALL GOOD.

24:12.068 --> 24:16.310
>> I AM ABSOLUTELY 100% TRYING
TO DEFLECT AND PLAY DUMB AND BE

24:16.344 --> 24:20.379
LIKE, OH, MY GOD, KATO, TOM, WHY
DIDN'T YOU TALK TO ME.

24:20.413 --> 24:21.724
>> YOU WON THE VETO.

24:21.758 --> 24:23.344
I DON'T WANT TO COME AND TELL
YOU WHAT TO DO

24:23.379 --> 24:24.344
>> WE NEED YOUR BRAIN.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.241
YOU'RE THE THINKER.

24:25.275 --> 24:33.310
WE NEEDED YOU GUYS.

24:33.344 --> 24:34.551
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

24:34.586 --> 24:38.310
>> WHAT DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DO?

24:38.344 --> 24:39.620
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

24:39.655 --> 24:42.862
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS WE HAVE TO
STICK TOGETHER.

24:42.896 --> 24:46.862
>> THE OTHER THING IS WE DO HAVE
MORE THAN 24 HOURS TO DECIDE.

24:46.896 --> 24:48.034
>> ARE WE ALL GOOD?

24:48.068 --> 24:49.655
>> YEAH.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.862
>> TOM AND KATO ARE POTENTIALLY
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE IF I'M STILL

24:51.896 --> 24:55.896
HERE NEXT WEEK, BECAUSE I'M MAD
AND I GOT NUMBERS.

24:55.931 --> 24:58.862
>> FOR FIVE?

24:58.896 --> 25:03.896
>> FUN FIVE.

25:03.931 --> 25:07.241
>> YOU COULDN'T FIND US IN THIS
HOUSE WITH SEVEN ROOMS?

25:07.275 --> 25:09.517
IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES.

25:09.551 --> 25:13.724
I DON'T TRUST RICKY, NATALIE,
AND LOLO FURTHER THAN I CAN

25:13.758 --> 25:14.862
THROW A STICK.

25:14.896 --> 25:16.724
THAT'S NOT VERY FAR.

25:16.758 --> 25:18.000
WE'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT.

25:18.034 --> 25:21.586
>> YES.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.827
>> LIARS.

25:22.862 --> 25:27.068
>> THE ACADEMY AWARD GOES TO ALL
THREE OF THEM.

25:27.103 --> 25:28.896
THOSE ARE THE RAZZIE, DUDE.

25:28.931 --> 25:32.172
THOSE ARE NOT ACAD MY AWARDS.

25:32.206 --> 25:36.103
>> Julie: UP NEXT, THINGS ARE
ANYTHING BUT FUN FOR TEAM FUN.

25:36.137 --> 25:38.724
THEN IT'S THE LIVE VOTE AND
EVICTION.

25:38.758 --> 25:41.724
WHOEVER GOES WILL LEAVE BEHIND A
HOUSE DIVIDED.

25:41.758 --> 25:45.689
CATCH ALL THE DRAMA ON "BIG
BROTHER AFTER DARK" TONIGHT ON

25:45.724 --> 25:48.724
MIDNIGHT ONLY AFTER POPS.

25:48.758 --> 25:50.827
STAY WITH US.

26:05.413 --> 26:08.517
>> WELCOME BACK TO "CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER."

26:08.551 --> 26:11.275
BIG FUN HAS SPLIT, BUT THAT'S
JUST THE BEGINNING OF THEIR

26:11.310 --> 26:15.034
PROBLEMS.

26:15.068 --> 26:16.275
[KNOCKING]
>> WHO IS IT?

26:16.310 --> 26:17.448
>> IT'S ME.

26:17.482 --> 26:21.517
>> WHAT'S UP?

26:21.551 --> 26:22.517
>> IT'S A GHOST TOWN IN HERE.

26:22.551 --> 26:23.482
IT'S SO WEIRD.

26:23.517 --> 26:28.137
I THINK TOM IS UNNECESSARILY
JUST --

26:28.172 --> 26:28.724
>> PARANOIA.

26:28.758 --> 26:31.482
>> IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

26:31.517 --> 26:32.551
>> IT'S INTENSE.

26:32.586 --> 26:33.689
>> IT'S INTENSE.

26:33.724 --> 26:37.551
>> I'M LIKE, DUDE, COME ON, MAN.

26:37.586 --> 26:38.793
YOU DON TRUST HIM.

26:38.827 --> 26:39.896
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.413
YOU DON'T TRUST HIM.

26:41.448 --> 26:44.965
SO IF THIS DUDE IS EVER GOING UP
IN THE NEXT TWO, THREE DAYS, IN

26:45.000 --> 26:49.310
MY OPINION, I DON'T THINK WE'D
EVEN HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT,

26:49.344 --> 26:52.068
YOU'RE OUT.

26:52.103 --> 26:55.620
KATO'S LITTLE ALLIANCE IS
CLICKING ALONG.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.482
THESE GUYS LET IT GET TO THEIR
HEADS AND STARTED TO TALK DOWN

26:58.517 --> 26:59.931
TO EVERYBODY.

26:59.965 --> 27:03.172
THIS NOW PRESENTED A OPPORTUNITY
FOR ME TO MAKE MY FIRST

27:03.206 --> 27:05.413
PROACTIVE STEP AND MAYBE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE VOTES TO

27:05.448 --> 27:06.758
KEEP ME HERE.

27:06.793 --> 27:11.241
>> IF IT'S NOT ME AT THE END,
PLEASE TAKE HIM DOWN.

27:11.275 --> 27:13.827
BECAUSE THESE GUYS THINK THEY
ARE SMARTER THAN YOU AND SMARTER

27:13.862 --> 27:18.517
THAN YOU, DEFINITELY SMARTER
THAN YOU.

27:18.551 --> 27:22.862
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE HOUSE
IS THAT.

27:22.896 --> 27:28.482
WE NEED TO SEND THIS HOUSE ON
ITS HEAD AND GET THOSE GUYS ON

27:28.517 --> 27:29.172
THE BLOCK.

27:29.206 --> 27:31.655
>> WE HAVE TO GET H.O.H.

27:31.689 --> 27:34.689
>> I'M LOVING WHAT JOEY IS
SAYING.

27:34.724 --> 27:38.931
TOM IS RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE
LIKE A LOONY TUNE.

27:38.965 --> 27:45.344
MAYBE IT'S IN MY GAME'S INTEREST
AND IN MY ALLIANCE TO KEEP JO JO

27:45.379 --> 27:46.068
AROUND.

27:46.103 --> 27:50.517
>> I'M NOT VOTING YOU OUT.

27:50.551 --> 28:00.620
I NEED YOU TO PICK FOR ME, JOE.

28:00.655 --> 28:07.586
I NEED YOU TO PICK FOR ME, JOE.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.379
>> I'M SO FRUSTRATED BECAUSE NOW
I'M AWARE THAT WE'VE BEEN

28:11.413 --> 28:12.241
SCAMMED.

28:12.275 --> 28:18.068
OUR PLAN WAS TO BACKDOOR RICKY.

28:18.103 --> 28:24.206
LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT THERE
WERE TRAITORS IN OUR ALLIANCE.

28:24.241 --> 28:26.206
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU GUYS, I'M
WINNING H.O.H.

28:26.241 --> 28:27.413
>> MICE.

28:27.448 --> 28:30.344
>> YEAH, REAL NICE.

28:30.379 --> 28:31.034
BUT YOU'RE SAFE.

28:31.068 --> 28:33.241
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

28:33.275 --> 28:35.862
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

28:35.896 --> 28:38.793
>> DID YOU EVER GO TO THE ACTING
ACADEMY.

28:38.827 --> 28:40.448
>> OH, MY GOD.

28:40.482 --> 28:40.862
I HAVE NOT.

28:40.896 --> 28:42.517
>> OKAY.

28:42.551 --> 28:43.586
WHY ARE YOU BEING WEIRD?

28:43.620 --> 28:50.655
>> I'M NOT BEING WEIRD, DARLING
NATALIE.

28:50.689 --> 28:53.655
>> SERIOUSLY.

28:53.689 --> 29:02.724
>> ALL IS GOOD.

29:02.758 --> 29:05.724
>> DID YOU WAKE UP ON THE WRONG
SIDE OF THE BED?

29:05.758 --> 29:08.344
>> I'M JUST BEING AWARE OF LIFE
AROUND ME.

29:08.379 --> 29:11.344
>> AND WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO
MEAN.

29:11.379 --> 29:13.896
>> WE SAID WE WERE TAKING
SOMEONE OFF.

29:13.931 --> 29:15.068
>> NO, WE DIDN'T.

29:15.103 --> 29:16.034
>> WE DID, TOO.

29:16.068 --> 29:17.379
>> ASK LOLO.

29:17.413 --> 29:18.724
>> OKAY.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.482
ACTUALLY, TALK TO TOM.

29:20.517 --> 29:22.551
TOM, I HAVE TO BRUSH MY TEETH
QUICK.

29:22.586 --> 29:23.724
>> WHAT'S UP?

29:23.758 --> 29:25.379
>> HE'S UPSET.

29:25.413 --> 29:30.724
>> YEAH, WELL... MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK PRIVATELY.

29:30.758 --> 29:33.000
>> I'M OVER IT.

29:33.034 --> 29:39.896
>> IT IS LIKE WE FEEL --
>> YOU GUYS CAN FEEL HOWEVER THE

29:39.931 --> 29:43.068
[BLEEPED] YOU ALL WANT TO FEEL,
BECAUSE I'M NOT FOR THIS.

29:43.103 --> 29:44.517
>> YOU'RE NOT WHAT?

29:44.551 --> 29:47.103
>> I'M NOT FOR THIS [BLEEPED].

29:47.137 --> 29:49.206
DO YOU WANT ME TO SPELL IT OUT
FOR YOU?

29:49.241 --> 29:52.448
>> DID YOU EVER TAKING AN ACTING
CLASS?

29:52.482 --> 29:54.793
>> I'M NOT AN ACTOR.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.482
>> I CAN READ THINGS.

29:57.517 --> 29:59.827
>> YOU CAN READ HOWEVER YOU WANT
THE WEAR IT.

29:59.862 --> 30:02.586
>> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO
READ, THE WHOLE HOUSE.

30:02.620 --> 30:04.655
YOU KEEP PISSING OFF AND BLOWING
UP.

30:04.689 --> 30:05.793
EVERY DAY YOU GUYS DO THIS.

30:05.827 --> 30:06.724
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:06.758 --> 30:09.137
YOU HAVE HAD VETO.

30:09.172 --> 30:10.482
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.448
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO, BOW
DOWN TO YOU?

30:13.482 --> 30:15.413
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THAT, TOM?

30:15.448 --> 30:19.206
LIKE LITERALLY, YOU ARE MAKING
PEOPLE WHO USED TO LIKE YOU HATE

30:19.241 --> 30:20.655
YOU GUYS.

30:20.689 --> 30:23.793
>> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS DID.

30:23.827 --> 30:28.344
>> FUN, FUN, FUN.

30:28.379 --> 30:29.758
>> ALL RIGHT.

30:29.793 --> 30:33.034
I FEEL BAD HAVING LIKE THIS
OLYMPIC HERO UPSET, BUT THEY

30:33.068 --> 30:34.586
LIED TO US.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.620
LOLO, WHY ARE YOU GETTING MAD AT
ME?

30:36.655 --> 30:37.620
IT'S JUST A GAME.

30:37.655 --> 30:41.103
YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE THIS SO
SERIOUSLY.

30:41.137 --> 30:42.620
IT'S NOT THE OLYMPICS.

30:42.655 --> 30:43.206
IT'S "BIG BROTHER."

30:43.241 --> 30:44.620
>> YOU GUYS BLEW IT.

30:44.655 --> 30:46.034
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

30:46.068 --> 30:49.344
DON'T GET MAD BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO BE IN YOUR LITTLE FAKE

30:49.379 --> 30:50.034
ALLIANCE.

30:50.068 --> 30:51.310
>> FUN, FUN, FUN Y'ALL.

30:51.344 --> 30:52.689
>> YEAH.

30:52.724 --> 30:56.689
>> Julie: SO KANDI OR JOEY,

31:28.724 --> 31:32.689
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM TO
FIND OUT.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.103
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

31:33.137 --> 31:34.655
>> HI, JULIE.

31:34.689 --> 31:35.724

31:35.758 --> 31:37.689
IT'S TIME FOR THE LIVE VOTE AND

KANDI, JOEY, IN JUST MOMENTS
YOUR HOUSEMATES WILL CAST THEIR

VOTES TO EVICT LIVE, BUT BEFORE
THEY DO, YOU EACH HAVE A FINAL

31:45.896 --> 31:50.931
CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR VOTE WITH
ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

31:50.965 --> 31:52.965
KANDI, YOU'RE FIRST.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.931
>> OKAY.

31:53.965 --> 31:57.275
I'M USED TO GIVING SPEECHES.

31:57.310 --> 32:01.310
FIRST, I WANT TO SAY, TODD,
RILEY, ACE, KAYLA, AND MAMA, I

32:01.344 --> 32:02.586

I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

32:03.586 --> 32:06.034
BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE I NEED TO
STAY.

32:06.068 --> 32:08.862
I REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO
PLAY THE GAME, ALTHOUGH SOME

32:08.896 --> 32:10.689
PEOPLE FEEL LIKE I'M NOT PLAYING
THE GAME.

32:10.724 --> 32:15.413
BUT I PLAN TO SHOW YOU THAT IF
YOU KEEP ME HERE AND, YES, SO I

32:15.448 --> 32:18.689
HOPE TO CONTINUE TO PLAY WITH
YOU GUYS.

32:18.724 --> 32:20.896

I WANT TO SAY HI TO MY GIRLS AT

I'M SO BLESSED TO HAVE ALL
GIRLS.

32:31.689 --> 32:32.413
LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE.

32:32.448 --> 32:35.137
THIS IS FAMILIAR TERRITORY.

32:35.172 --> 32:37.034
I TAKE IT AS FLATTERING.

32:37.068 --> 32:39.689
VOTE WITH YOUR MINDS AND NOT
YOUR HEARTS, BECAUSE IT'S A

32:39.724 --> 32:41.034
GAME.

32:41.068 --> 32:43.034
IF YOU VOTE FOR ME TO GOSH,LY
TAKE IT AS THE ULTIMATE

32:43.068 --> 32:45.689
COMPLIMENT, BECAUSE THE BEST
PLAYERS HAVE TO GO SO EVERYONE

34:15.862 --> 34:17.172
HER ALLIES THIS WEEK.

34:17.206 --> 34:20.482
WAS IT ENOUGH FOR HER TO KEEP
HIM IN THE GAME.

34:20.517 --> 34:24.137
HI, NATALIE EVA MARIE.

34:24.172 --> 34:25.758

37:52.344 --> 37:52.965
HUG IT OUT.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.965
HEY, EVERYBODY HOW ARE YOU?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.620
>> Julie: WOW.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.551
THAT WAS A LANDSLIDE.

38:02.586 --> 38:06.448
>> NICE TO KNOW EVERYBODY VOTED
FOR DO YOU STAY.

38:06.482 --> 38:07.379
>> I KNOW.

38:07.413 --> 38:10.000
I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS.

38:10.034 --> 38:20.034
>> THAT MUST FEEL GOOD.

38:20.068 --> 38:25.137
>> THAT MUST FEEL GOOD.

38:25.172 --> 38:26.586
>> BREATHE.

38:26.620 --> 38:27.206
BREATHE.

38:27.241 --> 38:29.068
>> THERE WE GO.

38:29.103 --> 38:30.931
NICE.

38:30.965 --> 38:31.551
WELL DONE.

38:31.586 --> 38:32.551
>> Julie: I'M SORRY.

38:32.586 --> 38:33.724
I HAD TO.

38:33.758 --> 38:35.586
YOU DON'T SEE LIKE YOU'RE
SURPRISED AT ALL.

38:35.620 --> 38:39.965
EVEN BEFORE I YOUR NAME, YOU
WERE LIKE, YEAH.

38:40.000 --> 38:40.896
>> IT'S ALL GOOD.

38:40.931 --> 38:42.137
YOU GET TO KNOW THE GAME.

38:42.172 --> 38:43.275
YOU GET TO KNOW THE PLAYERS.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.068
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS GAME THAT
WELL.

38:45.103 --> 38:47.275
I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO
WATCH A LOT OF TV.

38:47.310 --> 38:49.310
I GOT TWO YOUNG GIRLS.

38:49.344 --> 38:52.758
THEY USURP A LOT OF OUR TIME,
BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING

38:52.793 --> 38:54.000
RIDE.

38:54.034 --> 38:55.965
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I WAS
SIGNING UP FOR.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.275
MY OLDEST DAUGHTER WAS LIKE,
DAD, YOU GOT TO DO IT SO WE CAN

38:59.310 --> 39:03.620
WATCH YOU ON TV.

39:03.655 --> 39:05.172
I WAS LIKE, ALL RIGHT.

39:05.206 --> 39:09.275
I USUALLY JUDGE CHARACTERS THAT
I PLAY, NOT MY OWN PERSONA, SO

39:09.310 --> 39:10.862
IT'S A LITTLE INSECURE.

39:10.896 --> 39:13.793
IT MAKES YOU SELF-CONSCIOUS, BUT
I USE IT AS A CHALLENGE TO BREAK

39:13.827 --> 39:14.965
THROUGH SOME OF THAT.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.586
SO MET SOME COOL PEOPLE IN
THERE.

39:16.620 --> 39:21.310
RYAN IS AWESOME, AND I MET A LOT
OF OTHER GREAT PEOPLE, TOO.

39:21.344 --> 39:23.482
>> Julie: YOU SEEMED TO KNOW
THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL WHEN

39:23.517 --> 39:25.000
RYAN GOT EVICTED.

39:25.034 --> 39:28.068
>> THEY JUDGE JONATHAN, RYAN AND
I AS A THREAT FROM DAY ONE.

39:28.103 --> 39:28.517
>> Julie: WHY?

39:28.551 --> 39:29.965
>> I DON'T KNOW.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.482
MAYBE PHYSICALITY, ALTHOUGH WITH
A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES, ME

39:33.517 --> 39:36.344
BEING IN SHAPE WAS BASICALLY
USELESS.

39:36.379 --> 39:38.034
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

39:38.068 --> 39:40.551
KATO ONE THE GLAMOUR ROCK THING.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.068
SO I THINK THAT WAS LIKE WEIGHT
DISTRIBUTION.

39:43.103 --> 39:49.827
HE'S EVENLY DISTRIBUTED, NO
MUSCLE AT THE TOP, NONE AT THE

39:49.862 --> 39:50.344
BOTTOM.

39:50.379 --> 39:52.310
LOVE YOU, KATO.

39:52.344 --> 39:55.034
AND SO HE WAS ABLE TO HANG ON.

39:55.068 --> 39:57.172
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WORKED.

39:57.206 --> 39:59.034
>> Julie: YOU ADMIT YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THIS GAME.

39:59.068 --> 40:00.379
>> LEARNED ON THE FLY.

40:00.413 --> 40:04.241
>> Julie: EARLY ON, LOLO TRIED
TO FOLD YOU INTO THIS DOMINANT

40:04.275 --> 40:05.310
ALLIANCE.

40:05.344 --> 40:07.827
>> MIGHT HAVE MISSED THAT SIGNAL
THERE.

40:07.862 --> 40:08.931
>> Julie: YOU CUT HER OFF.

40:08.965 --> 40:11.206
YOU WERE LIKE, I HATE THAT WORD
ALLIANCE.

40:11.241 --> 40:12.827
SHE WAS LIKE... SHE LEFT.

40:12.862 --> 40:14.206
>> Julie: IS THAT WHAT SHE
DID?

40:14.241 --> 40:21.206
>> SHE BURNS HOT THAT ONE.

40:21.241 --> 40:23.103
SHE GETS MAD AT YOU.

40:23.137 --> 40:28.034
SHE LITERALLY GOES, HEY, LOLO,
YOU STARE ONE SECOND TOO LONG,

40:28.068 --> 40:30.034
WHY YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

40:30.068 --> 40:31.034
NO.

40:31.068 --> 40:32.137
NO.

40:32.172 --> 40:32.862
WHY YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

40:32.896 --> 40:35.310
LET ME GO TO MY ROOM.

40:35.344 --> 40:38.551
BE A MAN.

40:38.586 --> 40:41.689
I WAS GOING TO PUT MILAN DRY IN
THE BAG.

40:41.724 --> 40:45.034
IT MIGHT BE THE STRESS OF THE
GAME.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.896
IT'S PROBABLY WHAT MAKES HER A
GREAT ATHLETE.

40:46.931 --> 40:49.000
BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
DISTANCE.

40:49.034 --> 40:50.379
>> Julie: FINAL THOUGHTS.

40:50.413 --> 40:52.275
DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT
YOURSELF IN THIS GAME?

40:52.310 --> 40:54.034
>> I DID, FOR SURE, YES.

40:54.068 --> 40:58.034
I LEARN THAT I MAYBE DON'T NEED
TO BE SO SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY

40:58.068 --> 41:02.000
NIGHTLY ROUTINE, WHICH IS 45
MINUTES IN THE BATHROOM, BUT YOU

41:02.034 --> 41:03.551
KNOW WHY?

41:03.586 --> 41:08.310
IT'S A CHOICE, GROWING UP, DOING
WHAT I DID, THERE WAS ALWAYS SO

41:08.344 --> 41:11.655
MUCH CRAZINESS IN MY LIFE, THAT
I TOOK TIME GETTING READY FOR

41:11.689 --> 41:12.827
BED AS MY ZEN TIME.

41:12.862 --> 41:14.862
I SAY MY PRAYERS, I TAKE MY
TIME.

41:14.896 --> 41:18.689
I FELT SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT
THAT, BECAUSE I HAD 12 PEOPLE I

41:18.724 --> 41:20.586
DIDN'T KNOW WATCHING ME DO IT.

41:20.620 --> 41:23.689
>> Julie: JOEY, I TOLD YOU
BEFORE YOU WENT IN, SKINCARE

41:23.724 --> 41:24.344
LINE.

41:24.379 --> 41:25.517
>> I'M GOING TO DO IT.

41:25.551 --> 41:27.448
IT'S GENETICS A LOT OF IT.

41:27.482 --> 41:30.586
>> Julie: SO THE SUPER BOWL,
ANY GUESSES WHO IS GOING TO THE

41:30.620 --> 41:32.068
SUPER BOWL?

41:32.103 --> 41:34.103
>> I WOULD SAY THE PATRIOTS AND
RAMS IF I HAD TO GUESS RIGHT

41:34.137 --> 41:35.379
NOW.

41:35.413 --> 41:36.586
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> DID I GUESS RIGHT?

41:36.620 --> 41:37.931
>> Julie: YOU GUESSED RIGHT!

41:37.965 --> 41:39.862
>> I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO VEGAS.

41:39.896 --> 41:41.137
IT IS REALLY?

41:41.172 --> 41:41.586
>> Julie: YES.

41:41.620 --> 41:42.931
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

41:42.965 --> 41:45.862
>> Julie: WE'LL SEE YOU BACK
HERE ON FEBRUARY 13th, THE

41:45.896 --> 41:48.862
FINALE WHEN YOU AND THE REST OF
THE CELEBRITIES VOTE FOR THE

41:48.896 --> 41:50.413
WINNER OF "BIG BROTHER."

41:50.448 --> 41:53.034
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

42:13.068 --> 42:15.551
ALL OF THAT LIVE IN JUST TWO

42:15.586 --> 42:17.586
FOR NOW, FROM OUTSIDE THE BIG
