00:21.335 --> 00:26.615
Once the world was full of wonders,
but it belongs to humans now.

00:27.735 --> 00:30.253
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

00:30.255 --> 00:33.215
demons, vampires and witches...

00:34.295 --> 00:36.773
hiding in plain sight,

00:36.775 --> 00:38.893
fearful of discovery,

00:38.895 --> 00:41.015
ill at ease, even with each other.

00:43.415 --> 00:45.975
But, as my father used to say...

00:48.375 --> 00:50.533
in every ending

00:50.535 --> 00:52.775
there is a new beginning.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.775
-Matthew.
-Are you off to the library?

01:03.615 --> 01:06.413
-Yes.
-Well, you should know

01:06.415 --> 01:08.893
that it's absolutely full
to the brim with creatures.

01:08.895 --> 01:11.735
Waiting to see if you can
call the book up again.

01:12.735 --> 01:14.215
I thought we'd...

01:15.375 --> 01:17.575
Would you let me take you out
for the day instead?

01:18.415 --> 01:20.013
Diana? Erm...

01:20.015 --> 01:22.015
Do you mind if we just...?

01:29.535 --> 01:30.935
I, er...

01:31.215 --> 01:34.773
I just wanted to explain about
Peter Knox being at my house.

01:34.775 --> 01:37.093
It was you who told him
about the book.

01:37.095 --> 01:41.053
I told Sylvia. She asked.
I... I couldn't lie to another witch.

01:41.055 --> 01:42.733
I trusted you.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.895
You haven't exactly
been honest with me.

01:46.975 --> 01:48.853
You've used magic for your own gain.

01:48.855 --> 01:51.373
-Did Knox tell you that?
-He's a good man.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.495
He's in the Congregation.

01:55.935 --> 01:59.053
-He's worried about you and so am I.
-Well, you don't need to be.

01:59.055 --> 02:01.293
Look, I know that you're angry
with me. I understand.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.455
But that does not mean that
you need to spend time with that.

02:15.775 --> 02:17.615
I can open my own door.

02:31.495 --> 02:33.295
Where are we going, anyway?

02:34.295 --> 02:35.615
My house.

03:34.575 --> 03:37.255
I spend most of my time
at All Souls, but...

03:38.135 --> 03:39.853
I come back here

03:39.855 --> 03:41.855
very occasionally.

03:45.215 --> 03:46.813
This whole place...

03:46.815 --> 03:48.973
it's like a time capsule.

03:48.975 --> 03:50.295
Mm.

03:50.975 --> 03:53.215
Can't stay in the same place
for too long.

03:54.215 --> 03:56.533
Humans tend to get suspicious, so...

03:56.535 --> 03:58.413
I closed it up and left.

03:58.415 --> 04:00.453
But I've dropped by over the years.

04:00.455 --> 04:02.093
Updated the plumbing.

04:02.095 --> 04:03.815
Put in the electricity.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.975
Who's she?

04:11.535 --> 04:13.295
My sister, Louisa.

04:16.815 --> 04:18.575
Did you have to change your name?

04:21.415 --> 04:23.175
I always keep my Christian name.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.895
Otherwise, yes.

04:27.015 --> 04:28.495
What is your real name?

04:30.215 --> 04:31.695
De Clermont.

04:33.255 --> 04:34.575
You're French?

04:35.535 --> 04:37.215
Don't you ask a lot of questions.

04:39.055 --> 04:40.733
Yeah.

04:40.735 --> 04:42.455
It's the historian in me.

04:43.455 --> 04:45.575
I took my mother's name
when she sired me.

04:48.535 --> 04:50.613
She lived in France

04:50.615 --> 04:53.615
with my step-father, Philippe.

04:55.575 --> 04:57.375
He's no longer with us.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.855
-He died?
-Mm.

05:01.815 --> 05:03.135
Yes.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.015
We can be killed...

05:07.215 --> 05:09.135
if you try hard enough.

05:45.175 --> 05:47.973
-Rico Jean.
-Satu JÃ¤rvinen.

05:47.975 --> 05:49.975
Welcome to the Congregation.

05:54.055 --> 05:55.733
You're human.

05:55.735 --> 05:57.653
The job of administrating
the Congregation

05:57.655 --> 06:01.055
has been passed down to the oldest
male in my family for centuries.

06:02.215 --> 06:04.133
Have you got siblings?

06:04.135 --> 06:06.013
An elder sister.

06:06.015 --> 06:08.253
Well, she must be pleased.

06:08.255 --> 06:12.535
Oh, we're also tasked to help keep
all this secret from humans.

06:16.295 --> 06:18.335
The Congregation chamber.

06:26.295 --> 06:28.133
I want to see inside.

06:28.135 --> 06:29.935
I'm afraid you can't.

06:30.935 --> 06:33.175
Not unless we're in session.

06:34.575 --> 06:37.095
The demons are to
the north of the building.

06:38.175 --> 06:40.055
The vampires over there.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.815
And this...

06:45.615 --> 06:48.895
is the witches' archives.

07:09.175 --> 07:10.655
Were you an alchemist?

07:11.495 --> 07:13.775
No, no. I inherited those
from my brother.

07:14.775 --> 07:16.095
He was fascinated by it.

07:17.455 --> 07:19.415
Science with magic,
magic with science.

07:20.455 --> 07:22.573
He never knew
which way round it was.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.333
I'm not sure either, to be honest.

07:25.335 --> 07:27.055
That's why I'm drawn to it.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.935
Did you... cast a spell
to call the book up?

07:41.975 --> 07:44.533
No. No.

07:44.535 --> 07:47.533
No, I've never been very good
at spell casting.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.135
Well, then...

07:50.255 --> 07:51.655
perhaps...

07:52.655 --> 07:57.015
there was a spell on it and you just
happened to meet its conditions.

08:04.295 --> 08:05.893
What are you doing?

08:05.895 --> 08:07.735
I thought so.

08:08.975 --> 08:11.813
Your magic's instinctive. It just
comes out of you when you need it.

08:11.815 --> 08:13.613
You needed...

08:13.615 --> 08:16.095
Ashmole 782 for your research.

08:17.935 --> 08:19.335
It's not that simple.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.493
Well, no, of course not.

08:22.495 --> 08:24.975
There's something else, some kind
of link between you and the book.

09:25.095 --> 09:26.573
-Em?
-I thought I was getting

09:26.575 --> 09:30.813
-something there.
-How was I to know you were scrummying?

09:30.815 --> 09:33.175
I couldn't sleep. Dreams about Diana.

09:34.055 --> 09:36.693
-What?
-Odd things.

09:36.695 --> 09:38.733
I thought I'd try to peep.

09:38.735 --> 09:40.615
Did you see anything?

09:41.855 --> 09:45.053
A man... in the shadows.

09:45.055 --> 09:48.133
With her, following her.

09:48.135 --> 09:49.935
It was Knox.

09:50.935 --> 09:52.255
No, he wasn't a witch.

09:56.975 --> 10:01.295
Maybe you're right.
Maybe my magic is connected to need.

10:02.295 --> 10:05.373
Don't you have any memories of it
having surfaced before?

10:05.375 --> 10:09.333
No. I don't remember much
about my childhood.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.215
My parents died when I was young.

10:12.215 --> 10:13.575
Yes, I know.

10:14.855 --> 10:19.853
Living without magic isn't... bad.
I've survived without it.

10:19.855 --> 10:23.055
Well, that's not quite true.
You use it all the time.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.575
You can feel me
when I'm looking at you.

10:28.415 --> 10:30.415
That feels cold.

10:31.415 --> 10:34.215
Like ice growing under my skin.

10:35.295 --> 10:38.173
Witch power is in your blood
and it's in your bones.

10:38.175 --> 10:42.535
You were born to be a witch, just
as you were born to have blonde hair.

10:43.535 --> 10:45.175
Or those blue eyes.

10:46.415 --> 10:47.735
And you?

10:50.815 --> 10:52.735
Well, I was born a human.

10:57.335 --> 11:00.253
We didn't keep track
of birthdays back then.

11:00.255 --> 11:04.013
But I'd estimate it was in 500

11:04.015 --> 11:06.733
and then I was reborn
as a vampire in...

11:06.735 --> 11:09.455
the year 537.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.695
-The things you must have seen.
-Mm.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.095
And done.

11:23.775 --> 11:26.175
Would you like to have
dinner with me tomorrow?

11:40.535 --> 11:43.735
-New stock's arrived.
-Oh, what's come in?

11:44.935 --> 11:47.615
Ghosties and ghoulies and things
that go bump in the night.

12:13.295 --> 12:15.215
Hey!

12:18.295 --> 12:19.975
Hey, look at this.

12:20.975 --> 12:23.693
-Oh.
-The story's been up since this morning

12:23.695 --> 12:25.855
and already it's got
over 100 messages.

12:27.255 --> 12:29.653
I knew this was gonna work.

12:29.655 --> 12:31.933
The stories they're telling.

12:31.935 --> 12:35.693
Demons born to humans who had
no idea why they were different.

12:35.695 --> 12:37.895
They've spent half their lives
thinking they were freaks.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.575
And now you've got them
talking to each other.

12:45.735 --> 12:47.855
Someone's gonna want
to meet face to face.

12:48.975 --> 12:50.893
What do you reckon?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.973
Stay online for now.

12:52.975 --> 12:54.855
It's risky enough.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.093
What's this?

12:58.095 --> 13:01.413
I got them from the library. Look.

13:01.415 --> 13:04.335
Does this remind you of something?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.895
That's your statue.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.253
-Hey, Sarah.
-What are you doing...

13:25.255 --> 13:27.533
hanging around with a vampire?

13:27.535 --> 13:29.215
Has Em been spying on me?

13:29.935 --> 13:33.693
Anyway... most of the things we've been
told about them aren't true.

13:33.695 --> 13:36.053
He could feed off you,
take your memories.

13:36.055 --> 13:39.173
-I'm sure that's not true.
-That's what they do, Diana.

13:39.175 --> 13:40.893
He could have fed off you already.

13:40.895 --> 13:43.013
Seen everything you saw
when you opened that book.

13:43.015 --> 13:46.653
-You wouldn't remember.
-He wouldn't do anything like that.

13:46.655 --> 13:49.375
I'm not in any danger with him.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.813
Diana, do you remember the stories

13:52.815 --> 13:54.933
your mum told you
when you were little?

13:54.935 --> 13:59.935
The Shadow Prince that lived
between sunset and moonrise?

14:01.095 --> 14:06.173
Yeah.
Yeah, I used to love those stories.

14:06.175 --> 14:07.815
What if it's him?

14:10.255 --> 14:13.933
We are putting two and two together
and making five.

14:13.935 --> 14:17.253
We have no idea who this vampire is
or what he wants!

14:17.255 --> 14:19.373
Well, he's coming to dinner tonight...

14:19.375 --> 14:21.415
so I can just ask him.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.893
Morning.

14:35.895 --> 14:39.053
I presume it's not a coincidence
you're outside my college.

14:39.055 --> 14:41.093
Matthew's away at a conference.

14:41.095 --> 14:43.653
Molecular biology techniques.

14:43.655 --> 14:45.415
He asked me to keep an eye on you.

14:47.335 --> 14:50.733
-Is he always this controlling?
-With us, yes.

14:50.735 --> 14:52.733
But with a witch...

14:52.735 --> 14:54.175
it's a first.

14:56.175 --> 15:00.773
Okay, then, I may as well utilize you.
I'm feeding Matthew tonight.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.935
Talk me through it.

15:04.815 --> 15:07.293
Look, I'll tell you
what Matthew likes

15:07.295 --> 15:11.615
if you come to the lab
and get your bloods done.

15:13.095 --> 15:15.293
We're taking DNA from witch remains

15:15.295 --> 15:17.293
and we've identified four original
clans.

15:17.295 --> 15:18.773
Thanks.

15:18.775 --> 15:21.215
Don't you want to find out
which one the Bishops belonged to?

16:37.335 --> 16:41.375
This is our archive.
It's not for vampires.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.215
"Test of Diana Bishop's powers."

16:59.215 --> 17:01.455
Who is Diana Bishop?

17:04.775 --> 17:07.055
Surely, you've wondered
about the Bishop blood?

17:09.295 --> 17:10.775
I certainly have.

17:13.734 --> 17:15.613
What will this tell us?

17:15.615 --> 17:18.413
Your inherited traits and powers
and where you come from.

17:18.415 --> 17:22.532
Through your DNA we can trace descent
back to one of four witches who...

17:22.535 --> 17:24.214
What the hell are you doing?

17:25.535 --> 17:26.855
Stop now.

17:28.335 --> 17:30.813
If any vampire is
going to take her blood,

17:30.815 --> 17:33.095
it's going to be me.

17:46.655 --> 17:48.135
Are you all right?

18:22.095 --> 18:23.415
Grazie.

18:26.775 --> 18:28.775
A strange story came to me today.

18:29.735 --> 18:33.853
Apparently, Matthew de Clermont's
harassing a witch in Oxford.

18:33.855 --> 18:37.293
What? If it's true,
we should capitalise on it.

18:37.295 --> 18:40.613
Bring him in front of
the Congregation, punish him.

18:40.615 --> 18:45.533
It sounds unlikely to me. Did your
source tell you who this witch is?

18:45.535 --> 18:47.175
Her name's Diana Bishop.

18:48.375 --> 18:51.333
I couldn't get more than that.
My source was a witch herself.

18:51.335 --> 18:53.455
Probably lying to you
like they all do.

18:55.215 --> 18:59.373
Why would Matthew leave himself...
so vulnerable.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.613
There might not be any truth in it,
but if there is,

19:01.615 --> 19:04.213
we can't afford to miss
this opportunity.

19:04.215 --> 19:07.055
Someone should go over there
and find out.

19:23.735 --> 19:27.735
In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

19:54.215 --> 19:58.575
Beware the witch with the blood
of the lion and the wolf.

20:22.665 --> 20:24.825
Don't you ever close your door?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.943
Anyone could walk in.

20:27.945 --> 20:29.625
Oh, darling!

20:32.305 --> 20:34.063
Are these for us?

20:34.065 --> 20:36.583
You need to eat when you're pregnant.

20:36.585 --> 20:40.305
-Has the baby moved yet?
-Oh, she's lazy, I reckon.

20:42.985 --> 20:44.703
What's all this?

20:44.705 --> 20:46.943
I've been reading up on alchemy.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.943
Nat, your mum's here.

20:48.945 --> 20:52.143
"Alchemy exits to transform mortals

20:52.145 --> 20:55.383
from a state of suffering
to enlightenment."

20:55.385 --> 20:58.825
I didn't know you were into all this.
Hey!

20:59.825 --> 21:03.383
They've given me a day
to close the chatroom.

21:03.385 --> 21:04.903
Did you tell them?

21:04.905 --> 21:06.743
Of course not.

21:06.745 --> 21:08.903
I might not approve,
I'd never report you.

21:08.905 --> 21:10.943
Demons need to communicate
with each other.

21:10.945 --> 21:12.903
You know it's against Congregation...

21:12.905 --> 21:15.225
Well, it shouldn't be. It...

21:20.025 --> 21:22.503
If we were allowed to come together,
there'd be fewer problems.

21:22.505 --> 21:25.583
Not necessarily. Think of the risks.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.705
Demons aren't good
at doing things quietly.

21:29.825 --> 21:31.903
So we just get told to shut up
and hide away?

21:31.905 --> 21:34.063
Nat, don't fight it.

21:34.065 --> 21:35.983
So you fight it for me.

21:35.985 --> 21:37.943
You're on the Congregation.

21:37.945 --> 21:39.265
You have a voice!

21:42.625 --> 21:44.623
It's gonna get better.

21:44.625 --> 21:49.425
This has been in my family
for generations.

21:51.265 --> 21:52.865
How will that make it better?

21:53.305 --> 21:56.665
Well, it's the White Queen,
from alchemy.

21:57.905 --> 21:59.505
I don't think that's what that is.

22:02.025 --> 22:04.343
She's got a bow and arrow.

22:04.345 --> 22:06.623
She's like her, anyway.

22:06.625 --> 22:09.383
My... My dad told me
when the time comes

22:09.385 --> 22:12.025
that I must give her
to the person who needs her.

22:13.385 --> 22:15.145
How will you know who that is?

22:16.345 --> 22:19.145
I don't know... yet.

22:20.345 --> 22:22.465
Just have to wait for a sign.

22:29.985 --> 22:32.345
You like something maybe?

22:34.665 --> 22:36.745
-They're lovely.
-Thank you.

22:38.545 --> 22:39.945
Hello, Miriam.

22:43.345 --> 22:44.985
You're craving her.

22:45.945 --> 22:50.263
Miriam, how I feel about Diana Bishop
has absolutely nothing to do with you.

22:50.265 --> 22:51.823
She's a witch.

22:51.825 --> 22:53.625
You're a vampire.

22:54.745 --> 22:58.823
You know the rules. It's forbidden
by the terms of the Covenant.

22:58.825 --> 23:01.783
The Congregation isn't about to
enforce a thousand-year-old rule.

23:01.785 --> 23:03.623
Does Diana even know about it?

23:03.625 --> 23:05.745
Because Marcus
doesn't seem to think so.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.865
Bye, Miriam.

23:34.505 --> 23:35.945
Coming.

23:37.065 --> 23:38.385
Okay.

23:52.825 --> 23:54.825
Sorry, I'm running...

23:56.225 --> 23:57.545
Expecting someone?

23:58.945 --> 24:00.985
Get out of my rooms!

24:01.985 --> 24:03.305
Feeding him?

24:03.745 --> 24:08.023
You shy away from us and yet
you seek out vampire company.

24:08.025 --> 24:10.023
I'm not a bigot like you.

24:10.025 --> 24:12.183
Yes, just like your father.

24:12.185 --> 24:16.065
So open-minded that he put himself
and your mother in mortal danger.

24:23.465 --> 24:25.745
Mr Knox was just leaving.

25:15.145 --> 25:16.625
Red deer.

25:18.745 --> 25:21.703
A young Highland stag
from the taste of it.

25:21.705 --> 25:23.783
How could you possibly know that?

25:23.785 --> 25:25.543
Our senses are heightened.

25:25.545 --> 25:27.743
Oh, so some of the stories are true.

25:27.745 --> 25:30.263
-Can you fly?
-No.

25:30.265 --> 25:33.423
But we can run and jump very well,

25:33.425 --> 25:36.023
which makes humans
think that we can fly.

25:36.025 --> 25:37.665
And we're efficient, too.

25:38.505 --> 25:40.943
Our bodies don't use up much energy,

25:40.945 --> 25:44.943
so we have an awful lot
to draw upon when we need to.

25:44.945 --> 25:47.143
You don't breathe much.

25:47.145 --> 25:50.225
Well... our hearts don't beat...

25:51.865 --> 25:53.983
very often.

25:53.985 --> 25:56.303
I thought you knew about vampires.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.025
That's why you invited me to dinner.

26:01.025 --> 26:03.823
I probably know a little less
than most humans do.

26:03.825 --> 26:06.623
Most legends about us were...

26:06.625 --> 26:08.823
dreamed up by humans.

26:08.825 --> 26:11.583
Black hats and bats and brooms.

26:11.585 --> 26:18.463
Yes. Somewhere in all those stories
there's a speck of truth.

26:18.465 --> 26:21.383
Something that
frightened humans and...

26:21.385 --> 26:23.945
helped them to deny that we were real.

26:27.345 --> 26:28.865
What do you taste?

26:29.865 --> 26:32.105
Flowers and spice.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.065
-You?
-Oh, there's violets in there.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.543
Purple sugared ones.

26:39.545 --> 26:41.825
Elizabeth Tudor
absolutely adored them.

26:42.865 --> 26:44.385
Ruined her teeth.

26:45.265 --> 26:48.625
Also blackberries from hedgerows.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.105
Cigar smoke, redcurrants in brandy.

26:54.105 --> 26:55.665
I could go on.

26:58.025 --> 26:59.545
What would I taste like?

27:08.785 --> 27:10.265
Don't ever...

27:11.265 --> 27:13.065
say that to me.

27:20.985 --> 27:23.345
I only asked to understand.

27:24.985 --> 27:26.983
It would take but a moment.

27:26.985 --> 27:29.103
You wouldn't be able to stop me
if I struck

27:29.105 --> 27:31.345
and I wouldn't be able to stop myself.

27:33.905 --> 27:35.385
I'm safe with you.

27:46.025 --> 27:47.825
The smell of you...

27:50.465 --> 27:52.383
Willow sap.

27:52.385 --> 27:54.225
Camomile honey.

27:56.265 --> 27:57.665
Frankincense.

27:59.265 --> 28:00.625
Lady's mantle.

28:03.705 --> 28:06.345
Ancient things
I thought I'd forgotten.

28:09.065 --> 28:11.023
It's not only your scent.

28:11.025 --> 28:13.465
I can hear your witch's blood...

28:15.545 --> 28:17.425
moving in your veins.

28:21.105 --> 28:23.065
When I touch your skin...

28:24.545 --> 28:26.425
and it rushes to the surface.

29:10.185 --> 29:11.985
Thank you for dinner.

30:09.665 --> 30:11.705
Go and find Matthew.

30:15.305 --> 30:17.145
Thank you, Father.

31:38.265 --> 31:40.185
You knew about this!

31:41.225 --> 31:43.105
What? Who are they?

31:46.585 --> 31:48.065
My parents.

31:49.265 --> 31:51.223
Oh, I... I'm so sorry.

31:51.225 --> 31:54.663
-Knox sent these to me.
-Why would he do something like that?

31:54.665 --> 31:57.863
-Where is he?
-I... I have no idea.

31:57.865 --> 31:59.863
This is sick.

31:59.865 --> 32:01.705
Please, can we just
a talk about the...

32:02.905 --> 32:05.103
Are you going to give the book
to the vampire?

32:05.105 --> 32:07.143
I will understand that book.

32:07.145 --> 32:09.465
I'm gonna deal with this myself.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.345
Diana?

33:11.585 --> 33:13.065
Hey, Sean.

33:14.065 --> 33:16.063
Hey. Sorry, I know you're closing.

33:16.065 --> 33:17.905
I need to get a book.

33:18.905 --> 33:21.303
Ashmole 782.

33:21.305 --> 33:23.425
People have been
asking for that all week.

33:24.505 --> 33:26.423
It's missing.

33:26.425 --> 33:28.623
Last one who had it out was you.

33:28.625 --> 33:31.703
-I returned it to the stacks.
-Yeah, I remember. It's odd.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.983
Well then, it's got to be there.

33:33.985 --> 33:35.505
Can you check again?

33:36.545 --> 33:38.383
Just for me, please.

33:38.385 --> 33:41.423
I'll go and have a look.
Give me a few minutes.

33:41.425 --> 33:42.945
Thank you.

33:59.185 --> 34:01.425
We'll wait together, shall we?

34:14.545 --> 34:16.425
Gillian thought you might
take the book out.

34:17.425 --> 34:20.385
You see, she understands
its importance to us.

34:21.625 --> 34:23.983
You sent me those photographs.

34:23.985 --> 34:27.263
I don't want you
to end up like Rebecca.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.783
Your father made her turn her back
on her own kind.

34:29.784 --> 34:32.264
-Just as you are.
-Sorry, Diana, it's just not there.

34:33.545 --> 34:35.342
Don't worry about it.

34:35.344 --> 34:38.143
-It's fine.
-What's going on?

34:38.145 --> 34:40.223
-It's okay.
-Diana.

34:40.225 --> 34:42.425
Ask him to look again.

34:44.585 --> 34:47.505
All of you, get out!

34:48.505 --> 34:50.503
With this binding knot...

34:50.505 --> 34:51.824
Stop!

34:56.065 --> 34:57.385
Sean!

34:57.945 --> 34:59.265
Sean!

35:47.425 --> 35:49.465
Hold on, Diana!

35:53.745 --> 35:55.745
Don't hold your breath.

35:57.105 --> 35:58.825
Just breathe, Diana.

36:03.065 --> 36:04.545
I've got you.

36:08.465 --> 36:09.945
You're safe.

36:21.625 --> 36:24.065
Sean, are you okay?

36:43.185 --> 36:44.665
Is she okay?

36:46.185 --> 36:49.423
-No, she's exhausted.
-Not surprising.

36:49.425 --> 36:51.703
Witch wind.

36:51.705 --> 36:55.743
I've checked on Sean. He's fine.
And I've sorted out the Bodleian.

36:55.745 --> 36:58.743
If she wakes up,
tell her I'll return soon.

36:58.745 --> 37:00.065
Where are you going?

37:01.185 --> 37:03.423
I'm going to fight Peter Knox.

37:03.425 --> 37:05.263
If you make a move on him,

37:05.265 --> 37:07.663
it'll be seen as a direct challenge
to the Congregation.

37:07.665 --> 37:10.743
He sent her those photographs.
His scent was all over them.

37:10.745 --> 37:13.623
Are you seriously considering
endangering our family

37:13.625 --> 37:15.623
just to avenge a witch?

37:15.625 --> 37:19.105
-Are you questioning my loyalty?
-I'm questioning your judgment.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.825
Think before you do this.

37:24.025 --> 37:26.625
Get Diana out of Oxford, fine,
but don't take on Knox.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.625
If you do, it'll be war.

37:38.385 --> 37:42.185
I've never felt so protective
over anyone.

37:43.745 --> 37:46.705
You can protect her
without causing a shit storm.

37:48.905 --> 37:51.503
Drop her off with Hamish in Scotland.

37:51.505 --> 37:53.465
Leave her at Woodstock.

37:55.225 --> 37:56.545
No.

37:57.745 --> 38:00.943
-I'll take her to Sept-Tours.
-What?

38:00.945 --> 38:04.583
You can't put Ysabeau through that.
You can't leave a witch at her house.

38:04.585 --> 38:08.185
It's my house too.
And I'm not leaving her there.

38:09.665 --> 38:11.305
I'm going with her.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.865
Matthew.

38:41.505 --> 38:43.143
What time is it?

38:43.145 --> 38:46.623
Five o'clock.
You've been asleep for ten hours.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.305
You were exhausted
from the witch wind.

38:50.465 --> 38:52.983
-Witch wind?
-Mm.

38:52.985 --> 38:55.945
No witch has summoned it
for centuries.

38:57.345 --> 38:58.945
You have to leave Oxford.

39:01.225 --> 39:04.463
No, I... I can't leave.

39:04.465 --> 39:06.505
Peter Knox will come after you.

39:07.425 --> 39:10.505
-I can deal with Peter Knox.
-Not yet, you can't.

39:12.265 --> 39:15.665
Your power is extraordinary,
but it's undisciplined.

39:16.785 --> 39:19.863
You have to come to terms with it
somewhere safe.

39:19.865 --> 39:23.663
-I could go to my aunt's.
-No.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.945
No, I'm taking you home
with me to France.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.145
No witch would dare trespass
on vampire land.

39:39.105 --> 39:41.305
You'll be safe there.
