WEBVTT

00:11.268 --> 00:12.992
Sir, wash your window?

00:15.268 --> 00:17.087
- Go on, man, keep moving.
- Almost done.

00:17.111 --> 00:18.287
Don't need it. Go on.

00:24.282 --> 00:25.415
Pusher's back.

00:25.566 --> 00:27.850
I'm starving like Lee Marvin, McGee.

00:28.233 --> 00:29.782
What's taking you so long?

00:29.866 --> 00:31.366
He's making another deal.

00:32.399 --> 00:34.342
We're here to find out
who stole navy radar

00:34.366 --> 00:35.809
and stashed it across the street.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.225
He's not our problem

00:37.249 --> 00:38.909
unless he's pushing
steak and cheese hoagies.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.766
I'm a sworn federal agent, Tony.

00:40.799 --> 00:43.143
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch a felony go down.

00:43.167 --> 00:44.666
That's a good idea.

00:44.699 --> 00:46.933
Blow our stakeout over a $50 crack sale?

00:46.966 --> 00:48.709
If Gibbs doesn't slap you silly, I will.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.267
Oh, you're gonna slap me?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.900
If that's what you want, honey.

00:52.733 --> 00:53.909
Go for it, McFreaky.

00:53.933 --> 00:55.559
Goldilocks is just your type.

00:55.583 --> 00:56.599
Bite me.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.267
That'll be extra.

01:02.916 --> 01:03.916
Hey!

01:19.616 --> 01:20.700
Aha!

01:21.599 --> 01:24.532
Hey! Monitor number two
was flickering there-

01:24.616 --> 01:25.616
fixed it.

01:26.599 --> 01:28.399
I think I've seen that Beemer before.

01:28.432 --> 01:31.583
Yeah, we've seen it all before, McGee.

01:31.766 --> 01:34.566
Feels like we've been stuck
here for months doing nothing.

01:36.633 --> 01:39.076
Come on! I said scrambled.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.759
You haven't gotten a single
order right in four days.

01:41.783 --> 01:43.100
They're eggs-eat 'em.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.900
Well, I don't like sunny-side up.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.900
Sunny-side up oozes.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.400
They look like eyes.
They're looking at ya.

01:49.483 --> 01:51.849
I bet your burrito's
just the way you like it.

01:54.683 --> 01:56.733
You want your eggs scrambled?

02:00.333 --> 02:02.383
They're scrambled.

02:42.350 --> 02:44.610
Do you think prostitutes get bored?

02:44.634 --> 02:46.843
I mean, the same work.

02:46.867 --> 02:50.867
Day in, day out, day in, day out...

02:50.950 --> 02:52.017
Ziva.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.850
The storage facility?

02:54.833 --> 02:57.126
I'm sorry, Gibbs, I just get bored.

02:57.150 --> 02:58.550
I hate stakeouts.

03:08.383 --> 03:09.483
Abby.

03:13.783 --> 03:14.693
Abby!

03:14.717 --> 03:15.717
Gibbs!

03:19.934 --> 03:23.467
Hey, Gibbs, I was just,
um, stacking specimen jars.

03:23.502 --> 03:24.859
- Haven't heard from you.
- I know.

03:24.883 --> 03:28.076
I miss you, too. It's
so quiet around here.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.292
I had to go get my own Caf-POW.

03:29.316 --> 03:31.460
Did you know they raised
the price 25 cents?

03:31.484 --> 03:32.559
Did you come up with anything?

03:32.583 --> 03:34.692
I guess that depends on
what you mean by "anything."

03:34.716 --> 03:36.442
Anything. Abby, anything.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.067
Anything that can tell us who
rented this storage locker.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.766
- Gibbs, van.
- You didn't give me much to work with.

03:41.900 --> 03:44.176
McGee found a chewing gum
wrapper in the storage locker.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.683
I ran fingerprints, DNA, ultraviolet.

03:46.716 --> 03:48.242
Nothing. Nada. Zero.

03:48.266 --> 03:49.109
Watch the hallway.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.017
What I did get isn't much.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.876
I got two prints off
the rental agreement.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.276
Um, one matched the office manager.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.160
And the other, it's
a three-point partial,

03:59.184 --> 04:02.916
that could our fictitious
rentee of locker 23.

04:02.950 --> 04:03.759
Abby...

04:03.783 --> 04:06.916
AFIS gave me 3,251

04:06.950 --> 04:07.983
possible matches,

04:08.066 --> 04:10.150
just in the DC metropolitan area.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.450
So many men, so little time.

04:13.584 --> 04:15.783
They are in our hallway.

04:15.983 --> 04:16.983
Gibbs?

04:20.117 --> 04:21.117
Twenty-three...

04:21.700 --> 04:24.567
23. Locker 23 to the left.

04:25.550 --> 04:29.367
Twenty... three.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.283
Please.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.017
Keep an eye on 'em.

04:38.150 --> 04:39.333
They are late.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.534
I'm going to call DiNozzo.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.350
They may have killed each other.

04:47.283 --> 04:48.276
DiNozzo.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.450
Ah. Where are you?

04:49.483 --> 04:50.584
I just left my place.

04:51.017 --> 04:52.066
Are you kidding me?

04:52.150 --> 04:53.684
How long will it take you to get here?

04:53.716 --> 04:54.584
With luck, an hour.

04:54.617 --> 04:56.550
- I don't know.
- Your goose is fried.

04:57.534 --> 04:58.534
Cooked.

05:01.383 --> 05:02.916
And, no, it's not.

05:02.950 --> 05:03.983
Only a minute late.

05:04.366 --> 05:05.383
Idiot.

05:06.016 --> 05:07.016
Where's Gibbs?

05:08.583 --> 05:09.883
Oh.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.093
What did I miss?

05:11.117 --> 05:13.016
Goldilocks hooked up with Papa Bear

05:13.050 --> 05:15.826
and they found a bed
that is "just right."

05:15.850 --> 05:17.783
Personally, I think she
could have done better.

05:17.816 --> 05:18.850
What?

05:18.983 --> 05:21.983
That Jack she is with is... gross.

05:22.016 --> 05:23.150
You mean John.

05:23.383 --> 05:24.450
You know him?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.033
Oh, my God.

05:29.100 --> 05:29.959
Phew.

05:29.983 --> 05:32.933
If you care, DiNozzo, nobody
came to the storage locker.

05:33.283 --> 05:34.650
Hey, boss.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.550
Where's McGee?

05:44.833 --> 05:46.293
Oh, yeah, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

05:46.317 --> 05:47.883
We finally agreed on something.

05:47.916 --> 05:48.959
We're going to commute separately,

05:48.983 --> 05:50.342
'cause he's always whining.

05:50.366 --> 05:51.417
It's all he does.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.866
You know, the air-conditioning,
and this and that.

05:53.977 --> 05:55.159
Is there any way we
can shuffle the deck?

05:55.183 --> 05:56.883
You know, sort of do this differently?

05:56.916 --> 05:58.716
I don't know, mix it up a little...

05:58.899 --> 06:00.183
Or not.

06:00.217 --> 06:01.617
You know, we'll figure it out.

06:01.650 --> 06:03.150
We'll work it out.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.866
Sorry, boss, there was a...

06:06.067 --> 06:07.550
an accident on the Mason Bridge.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.483
- The e-mail?
- Uh, still working on it.

06:09.517 --> 06:12.350
It's definitely a free account
opened under a fictitious name.

06:12.616 --> 06:13.849
Knew that two days ago.

06:13.883 --> 06:15.076
Trying to track the e-mail's path,

06:15.100 --> 06:16.416
but there's several servers.

06:16.499 --> 06:18.059
Whoever tipped us
about the missing radar

06:18.083 --> 06:19.143
being in this storage locker

06:19.167 --> 06:20.967
is going to great lengths
to remain anonymous.

06:21.117 --> 06:22.126
Pusher's back.

06:22.150 --> 06:23.716
So is the suit in the Beemer.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.550
Guy's dealing drugs up the street.

06:29.584 --> 06:30.983
Yeah. Noticed.

06:31.716 --> 06:33.317
Same buyer was here yesterday, too.

06:33.350 --> 06:34.483
Love to bust 'em.

06:34.617 --> 06:35.816
Record it.

06:36.249 --> 06:38.299
Turn it over to Metro when we're done.

06:41.533 --> 06:42.849
Have a nice day, McGee.

06:45.283 --> 06:46.433
Alone at last.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.717
You watch.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.566
I'll do this, you do that.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.700
You're a dead man, McGee.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.516
Don't look at me, raccoon boy.

06:58.967 --> 06:59.967
It was Ziva.

07:00.033 --> 07:01.050
Ziva.

07:01.383 --> 07:03.383
I did everything you wanted.

07:03.417 --> 07:04.749
What do you want from me?

07:05.033 --> 07:06.433
Something's going on.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.550
Come on.

07:28.334 --> 07:31.217
Somebody help! Call 911, man!

07:31.250 --> 07:33.849
Call 911! Call the police!

07:34.317 --> 07:35.783
Come on!

07:38.383 --> 07:39.916
Hey, is he dead?

07:40.950 --> 07:42.617
Is he dead? What's going on?

07:56.461 --> 08:00.011
Driver's license and car registration
ID him as Scott Matthew Rowe.

08:00.194 --> 08:02.936
44. Home address in the
Adams Morgan district.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.777
It doesn't look like a robbery.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.611
We got video of him going
into the alley with a suspect.

08:06.995 --> 08:08.478
- Really?
- Caucasian,

08:09.011 --> 08:09.910
early 30s.

08:09.944 --> 08:10.961
Lucky break.

08:11.344 --> 08:13.170
So NCIS just happened
to be in the neighborhood

08:13.194 --> 08:14.287
with a camera?

08:14.311 --> 08:17.045
I'll, uh, have someone
e-mail the video to you.

08:17.611 --> 08:18.704
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

08:18.728 --> 08:20.048
This is a restricted crime scene.

08:20.211 --> 08:21.211
Boss?

08:21.244 --> 08:22.544
Oh, he's one of yours?

08:22.928 --> 08:23.887
Oh, yeah.

08:23.911 --> 08:25.321
Special Agent DiNozzo.

08:25.345 --> 08:26.645
Anthony. Tony.

08:27.295 --> 08:28.511
Detective Sparr.

08:30.144 --> 08:31.145
Ah.

08:33.727 --> 08:35.171
Detective Sparr, what's it look like?

08:35.195 --> 08:37.386
Classic-rich guy,
wants to get high,

08:37.410 --> 08:40.554
trolls known area to
buy recreational drug.

08:40.578 --> 08:41.695
Deal goes bad.

08:41.927 --> 08:43.044
Mmm. You think so?

08:44.428 --> 08:45.744
You think otherwise?

08:45.877 --> 08:47.317
Guy rolling around in a $90,000 car,

08:47.377 --> 08:49.304
buying drugs in a
neighborhood like this,

08:49.328 --> 08:50.894
I wouldn't turn the engine off,

08:50.927 --> 08:52.228
let alone get out of the car.

08:53.311 --> 08:54.994
Thanks for your help,
Special Agent Gibbs.

08:55.027 --> 08:55.944
Appreciate the video.

08:55.977 --> 08:58.544
I worked narcotics,
Baltimore PD, two years.

08:59.028 --> 09:01.028
Three, before I transferred to homicide.

09:02.695 --> 09:03.936
Okay, what do we have?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.360
That the murder weapon?

09:09.278 --> 09:12.310
When did a pipe become a drug
dealer's weapon of choice?

09:20.861 --> 09:21.861
Abby?

09:22.428 --> 09:23.445
Abigail!

09:23.877 --> 09:25.544
What are you doing?

09:25.578 --> 09:28.211
I'm trying to change
my spatial orientation

09:28.244 --> 09:30.444
and help myself get a new perspective.

09:30.478 --> 09:31.878
How is it working?

09:35.411 --> 09:36.687
I think I'm going to be sick.

09:36.711 --> 09:38.077
You wanted to see me?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.244
You didn't have to make a special trip.

09:40.277 --> 09:42.910
But when you regain your equilibrium,

09:42.944 --> 09:44.411
I have a John Doe.

09:44.444 --> 09:47.604
I need a CBC with platelets

09:47.628 --> 09:49.903
and a complete chem screen

09:49.927 --> 09:51.660
and CK.

09:55.677 --> 09:58.244
Ducky, this, uh,

09:58.277 --> 09:59.870
John Doe doesn't have
a case number on it.

09:59.894 --> 10:01.137
Yet to be determined.

10:01.161 --> 10:03.311
I'll give it to you later.

10:07.177 --> 10:08.554
My company spent the last ten years

10:08.578 --> 10:10.544
developing that radar system.

10:10.578 --> 10:12.745
You need to release it back to us now.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.404
Stakeout's our best chance to
catch who was behind the theft.

10:15.428 --> 10:16.611
It's been two weeks.

10:16.694 --> 10:18.734
Since the radar was stolen.
It's only been four days

10:18.761 --> 10:20.986
since we got the e-mail
tipping us off to its location.

10:21.010 --> 10:22.478
Haven't you got something to say,

10:22.511 --> 10:23.778
Captain?

10:23.811 --> 10:25.371
Have you found out who sent the e-mail?

10:25.411 --> 10:26.270
Working on it.

10:26.294 --> 10:27.453
Okay, I thought this nightmare was over

10:27.477 --> 10:28.844
when the radar was found.

10:29.745 --> 10:30.453
I should have never agreed

10:30.477 --> 10:32.276
to let you and the navy use it as bait.

10:32.977 --> 10:34.478
Why do you have to leave it there?

10:34.511 --> 10:36.444
You can still arrest
whoever comes to collect it.

10:36.478 --> 10:37.845
Covert surveillance.

10:37.877 --> 10:40.578
Got in, planted the cameras, got out.

10:40.611 --> 10:41.910
Your point?

10:42.844 --> 10:45.411
It takes time to move the radar.

10:45.444 --> 10:48.144
We might not be the only
ones watching the locker.

10:51.678 --> 10:54.177
Know what this is, Agent Gibbs?

10:54.211 --> 10:55.570
Zumwalt class destroyer.

10:55.594 --> 10:58.144
Stealth destroyer, Agent Gibbs;
Without its radar, it's useless.

10:58.177 --> 10:59.654
I was supposed to be
at that shipyard today

10:59.678 --> 11:01.277
installing that radar.

11:02.011 --> 11:02.911
Instead, I have to stand by

11:02.945 --> 11:05.544
and watch you play policeman.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.454
I'd like to help you here, Gibbs,

11:11.478 --> 11:13.845
but that ship is due to
start sea trials next month.

11:15.227 --> 11:17.754
It gets delayed,
SECNAV will have my ass.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.877
They'll want a much
higher price than that.

11:31.378 --> 11:32.544
Oh.

11:32.578 --> 11:34.578
Oh, Anthony, you scared me.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.994
Is the stakeout over?

11:38.027 --> 11:39.178
I wish.

11:39.211 --> 11:41.545
It's worse than watching
a five-day cricket match.

11:41.578 --> 11:43.644
Careful, young man.

11:43.678 --> 11:44.944
It's late,

11:44.977 --> 11:46.977
you've been working 12-hour shifts.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.944
I would think you'd rather be anywhere

11:48.977 --> 11:51.478
but here on your time off.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.877
You must want something.

11:53.910 --> 11:57.378
Well... how well do
you know the city ME?

11:57.411 --> 11:59.010
Tom Hubbard? I play bridge with him

11:59.044 --> 12:00.144
every Tuesday night.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.010
Excellent medical examiner.

12:02.044 --> 12:03.910
Dreadful bridge player.

12:04.344 --> 12:05.728
There was a murder this morning,

12:06.511 --> 12:07.787
down the street from the stakeout,

12:07.811 --> 12:10.544
and I'd love to get a
look at the autopsy report.

12:10.828 --> 12:13.611
Can't you get one
through normal channels?

12:13.644 --> 12:15.220
Mm, I had a little difference of opinion

12:15.244 --> 12:16.827
with the homicide detective;

12:16.861 --> 12:18.611
She and I didn't see eye to eye.

12:18.944 --> 12:19.944
"She"?

12:21.378 --> 12:24.211
Does Gibbs know you're doing this?

12:40.845 --> 12:44.111
Um, Tony's going to try to get even.

12:44.144 --> 12:45.611
I know he has booby-trapped

12:45.644 --> 12:47.544
something.

12:50.178 --> 12:51.544
Boss, hey, got your message.

12:51.728 --> 12:52.910
Uh, what's wrong?

12:52.944 --> 12:54.187
I'm getting a low battery signal

12:54.211 --> 12:55.778
from the camera in the locker.

12:55.811 --> 12:57.187
That's odd, I used fresh batteries.

12:57.211 --> 12:58.721
Should be good for
at least another week.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.244
Hmm...

13:01.677 --> 13:03.777
Okay, I'll go see what's going on.

13:24.678 --> 13:27.244
McGee, hallway's empty.

13:42.244 --> 13:43.053
McGee,

13:43.077 --> 13:44.644
we haven't got all day.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.144
Boss, what do you see on the monitor?

13:51.861 --> 13:54.745
I see a radar system
on a shipping pallet.

13:55.778 --> 13:57.411
You sure?

13:57.744 --> 13:59.877
We're staring right at it, McGee.

14:01.260 --> 14:02.544
Do you see me?

14:04.444 --> 14:05.845
"Do you see me?" No!

14:12.773 --> 14:14.694
Boss, we've got a problem.

14:26.380 --> 14:27.373
Camera's working fine, boss.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.807
I don't know why...

14:29.831 --> 14:32.373
I would start a sentence
with "I don't know."

14:32.397 --> 14:33.831
Figure it out, McGee.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.114
Fast!

14:36.897 --> 14:38.431
Yeah?

14:39.131 --> 14:41.156
Would not want to be Gibbs right now.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.598
I would not want to be McGee anytime.

14:48.531 --> 14:49.907
We are a team.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.197
We need to support each other.

14:52.231 --> 14:54.097
No more practical jokes.

14:57.698 --> 14:59.598
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

14:59.631 --> 15:01.297
Agreed.

15:02.331 --> 15:03.763
Agreed.

15:05.464 --> 15:07.598
Hmm.

15:09.130 --> 15:10.631
Détente.

15:12.264 --> 15:12.973
This is crazy.

15:12.997 --> 15:14.707
I'm taking pictures of an empty room.

15:14.731 --> 15:16.306
How did $90 million worth

15:16.330 --> 15:18.831
of high-tech electronics
just... vanish?

15:18.864 --> 15:21.189
I saw David Blaine make
an elephant disappear once

15:21.213 --> 15:22.890
in front of hundreds of people.

15:22.914 --> 15:24.014
It's an illusion, Tony.

15:24.098 --> 15:25.857
He's an illusionist. I can assure you

15:25.881 --> 15:27.930
the elephant never left the building.

15:27.964 --> 15:28.707
We have to open

15:28.731 --> 15:30.097
and check every locker.

15:30.131 --> 15:31.223
We need a warrant.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.656
"Warrants." One for each locker.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.781
Or not.

15:35.264 --> 15:36.930
I'll go lean on the manager.

15:43.364 --> 15:44.790
Sorry, Special Agent Gibbs.

15:44.814 --> 15:46.056
I was told the captain was coming on

15:46.080 --> 15:47.473
15 minutes ago.

15:47.497 --> 15:49.597
I'm being punished, Sandi.

15:53.414 --> 15:54.497
Sorry, Gibbs.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.981
SECNAV wouldn't let me go.

15:56.014 --> 15:57.173
Wants to know whose bright idea

15:57.197 --> 15:59.981
it was to use top secret radar as bait.

16:00.014 --> 16:02.423
That'd be Gibbs, two "B" s.

16:02.447 --> 16:03.781
Yeah, he knows.

16:03.814 --> 16:06.130
Look, he's trying to
track down your director.

16:06.164 --> 16:08.064
Her office says she's
out of the country.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.564
She is.

16:09.598 --> 16:12.286
DNI is concerned the technology
may be in the wrong hands

16:12.476 --> 16:14.081
and Chow's hysterical.

16:14.114 --> 16:15.357
I guess I don't need to tell you that.

16:15.381 --> 16:17.830
He says it'll take nine
months to remanufacture.

16:17.863 --> 16:19.590
Have the sea trials been delayed?

16:19.614 --> 16:21.964
Not officially, but you've
read the press releases.

16:21.997 --> 16:23.890
The Zumwalt class multimission destroyer

16:23.914 --> 16:26.430
is being touted as the
future of the blue-water navy.

16:26.714 --> 16:28.490
SECNAV is not ready to go public,

16:28.514 --> 16:32.130
especially if the technology
has been compromised.

16:33.730 --> 16:35.330
I wish I could help you, Gibbs.

16:42.263 --> 16:42.931
You got it.

16:42.955 --> 16:45.030
At great personal expense, I fear.

16:45.414 --> 16:47.663
I agreed to be Tom
Hubbard's bridge partner

16:47.697 --> 16:49.774
at a tournament next month.

16:49.798 --> 16:52.130
A weekend in hell.

16:53.598 --> 16:55.364
You want the highlights?

16:55.397 --> 16:56.823
- Yes, please.
- Cause of death:

16:56.847 --> 16:57.664
Blunt force trauma.

16:57.698 --> 16:59.257
He was not a healthy man.

16:59.281 --> 17:01.614
Mr. Rowe had quadruple bypass surgery

17:01.697 --> 17:03.831
before his 40th birthday.

17:03.864 --> 17:06.714
- Was he an addict?
- Most definitely.

17:07.048 --> 17:08.205
He appears to have been addicted

17:08.230 --> 17:10.473
to fatty red meats, fried foods

17:10.498 --> 17:11.498
and eggs.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.490
- His cholesterol was 388.
- Drugs?

17:14.513 --> 17:15.997
No, not even an aspirin.

17:16.147 --> 17:18.631
Which he should have been
taking on a daily regimen

17:18.714 --> 17:20.140
for his condition.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.579
Thanks, Ducky, I owe you.

17:21.614 --> 17:24.647
And one day, dear boy, I shall collect.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.114
Cover for me. I've got to run an errand.

17:30.364 --> 17:31.730
Tony's playing with fire.

17:31.764 --> 17:34.097
Yeah, that's what I told him.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.281
Ooh, time for me to exit stage left.

17:37.314 --> 17:39.390
We checked the storage
facility from bottom to top.

17:39.414 --> 17:40.990
The radar's not in the building.

17:41.014 --> 17:43.364
- Where's DiNozzo?
- Uh...

17:43.397 --> 17:45.531
uh, he's uh...

17:45.564 --> 17:47.431
running an errand.

17:49.497 --> 17:51.947
Never cover for me, David.

17:51.981 --> 17:54.114
Boss, finally managed
to trace the e-mail.

17:54.147 --> 17:55.890
It was transmitted from a cell phone

17:55.914 --> 17:58.473
using a Wi-Fi network in
the Dupont Circle area.

17:58.497 --> 18:00.773
- Who?
- I don't have a name yet, but I do

18:00.797 --> 18:02.677
have the electronic serial
number of the device.

18:02.763 --> 18:05.473
Cell provider's going to get back to me
with the name of the registered owner.

18:05.497 --> 18:07.397
Bring him in.

18:07.431 --> 18:09.507
This is the guy we've been
looking for, have you seen him?

18:09.531 --> 18:11.097
Let's see...

18:11.130 --> 18:12.564
- No.
- All right.

18:12.598 --> 18:14.397
Well, you call me if
you remember anything?

18:14.431 --> 18:16.431
Sure. I'll call you.

18:20.030 --> 18:22.164
Any good tips... on the case?

18:22.747 --> 18:24.630
You're here because I
didn't return your call.

18:24.714 --> 18:26.473
- Well, that would've been nice, yeah.
- Well, when I'm in the middle

18:26.497 --> 18:28.597
of an investigation, I
don't return social calls.

18:28.630 --> 18:30.006
What makes you think it was social?

18:30.030 --> 18:32.090
The way you stared at
my ass the other day.

18:32.114 --> 18:34.790
How do you know my interest in
your ass wasn't purely professional?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.964
I have dealt with your type all my life.

18:36.997 --> 18:38.523
Really? What is my type?

18:38.547 --> 18:40.773
Not my type. Rules don't apply to you,

18:40.797 --> 18:43.231
can't imagine a woman wouldn't
hang on your every word.

18:43.264 --> 18:45.074
Have you always lacked self-esteem?

18:45.098 --> 18:46.690
I've got a murder to solve.

18:46.714 --> 18:49.114
Haven't you got a drunk sailor to find?

18:49.497 --> 18:51.797
Try me again in a couple of months.

18:51.830 --> 18:52.497
Well, you do have a nice ass,

18:52.531 --> 18:55.030
but it wasn't a social
call, it was business.

18:55.064 --> 18:57.090
Scott Rowe wasn't
murdered in a drug deal.

18:57.114 --> 18:59.997
He wasn't a user; There
were no drugs in his system.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.523
How do you know that?

19:01.547 --> 19:02.997
Autopsy report.

19:03.531 --> 19:05.264
I haven't seen it.

19:11.631 --> 19:12.880
You went around me.

19:12.914 --> 19:15.331
Well, if you'd let me help,
I wouldn't have to do that.

19:15.364 --> 19:18.164
Hey.

19:18.197 --> 19:19.840
I have a gut feeling about this case.

19:19.864 --> 19:20.881
Why?

19:21.964 --> 19:23.124
Why do I have a gut feeling?

19:23.148 --> 19:25.364
Why do you want to help?

19:25.397 --> 19:28.464
Because I feel responsible.

19:28.497 --> 19:30.140
I could have stopped it.
I saw what was going down,

19:30.164 --> 19:32.430
and I thought it was just
a drug deal, just like you.

19:32.463 --> 19:33.640
And it wasn't, trust me.

19:33.664 --> 19:35.730
My instincts are usually right.

19:39.431 --> 19:41.856
You don't do anything
without telling me.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.140
Absolutely.

19:43.164 --> 19:44.814
Any leads?

19:46.880 --> 19:48.863
No prints on the murder weapon.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.307
We enhanced your video,
got a decent image

19:50.331 --> 19:51.698
of the drug dealer's face.

19:51.930 --> 19:53.556
ID'd him as Dennis Moran.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.023
Multiple arrests,

19:55.047 --> 19:56.663
most drug-related, convicted twice.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.207
We're looking for him.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.598
What about Scott Rowe?

19:59.631 --> 20:00.957
He's a hard guy to figure.

20:00.981 --> 20:02.814
Was a stockbroker, lost his license,

20:02.847 --> 20:05.457
couple of civil lawsuits against him.

20:05.481 --> 20:06.557
Shady deals.

20:06.581 --> 20:09.940
Rowe's had a history of financial
ups and downs, currently down.

20:09.964 --> 20:11.164
Excuse me.

20:11.597 --> 20:12.390
Yeah?

20:12.414 --> 20:13.463
Yeah.

20:13.897 --> 20:15.364
Well, did you tell him...

20:16.397 --> 20:18.097
Yeah.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.431
Well, try it.

20:26.463 --> 20:29.140
I thought you said you
found the anonymous tipster.

20:29.164 --> 20:30.656
I did.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.723
Name's Jordyn Wright.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.040
The e-mail was sent
from her cell phone.

20:33.064 --> 20:35.639
Mom, how much longer
do we need to wait here?

20:35.663 --> 20:36.773
I don't know, honey.

20:36.797 --> 20:38.990
She couldn't get a sitter?

20:39.014 --> 20:41.397
Jordyn's the girl, not the mother.

20:50.797 --> 20:51.990
Special Agent Gibbs.

20:52.014 --> 20:53.831
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

20:53.864 --> 20:56.664
Told him I didn't send you any e-mail.

21:05.731 --> 21:08.857
NCIS received a message from this phone.

21:08.881 --> 21:09.914
Not from me.

21:09.947 --> 21:11.947
Now, can I have it back, please?

21:11.981 --> 21:14.197
Did you let somebody borrow it?

21:15.763 --> 21:17.606
Not allowed to.

21:17.630 --> 21:19.614
Where were you last
Thursday night, Jordyn,

21:19.647 --> 21:21.380
about 7:30?

21:21.413 --> 21:23.664
It was a school night. She was home.

21:23.698 --> 21:26.797
You were in the Dupont
Circle area, weren't you?

21:27.780 --> 21:28.780
No.

21:34.297 --> 21:36.863
Okay, so I was in Rock 'N Java.

21:36.897 --> 21:38.274
- What?
- See?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.723
Like you and Dad even noticed.

21:39.747 --> 21:41.923
Who were you with? You weren't
with that Ramone boy, were you?

21:41.947 --> 21:43.007
Nicky, Mom.

21:43.031 --> 21:44.673
Nicky Ramone, and he's not

21:44.697 --> 21:45.914
a boy, he's 17.

21:45.948 --> 21:47.390
That's exactly why you can't see him.

21:47.414 --> 21:49.047
You can't choose my friends.

21:49.081 --> 21:51.763
Mrs. Wright, deal with this later.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.264
You let someone borrow it?

21:56.497 --> 21:59.464
Some guy at the next table
couldn't get a signal.

21:59.497 --> 22:01.390
He gave me ten bucks to use mine.

22:01.414 --> 22:04.097
Would you recognize him?

22:04.980 --> 22:06.013
I guess.

22:06.547 --> 22:07.257
You are supposed to be working

22:07.281 --> 22:08.440
on our case, Tony.

22:08.464 --> 22:10.906
Our murder victim was
a loser and a fraud.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.606
Not our murder victim, Tony.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.331
Declared bankruptcy twice.

22:14.364 --> 22:16.690
Beemer leased for $1,200 a month.

22:16.714 --> 22:18.273
He was three months behind on payments.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.856
Does Metro Homicide
know what you are doing?

22:20.880 --> 22:22.664
Detective Sparr and I
have an understanding.

22:24.331 --> 22:25.723
I'll bet you do.

22:25.747 --> 22:27.531
Detective Sparr must be hot.

22:27.564 --> 22:28.556
Yes.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.431
But no. For the moment,
it's all business.

22:30.464 --> 22:32.531
- Hmm. Business?
- Business.

22:32.564 --> 22:33.690
Her name's Abby. You're gonna love her.

22:33.714 --> 22:36.431
She's gonna do a computer
sketch of this guy, okay?

22:36.464 --> 22:38.464
Is this some kind of test?

22:39.663 --> 22:42.240
You already know who
borrowed my cell phone.

22:42.264 --> 22:43.790
Who, Jordyn?

22:43.814 --> 22:44.864
Him.

22:50.047 --> 22:51.390
Are you sure, Jordyn?

22:51.414 --> 22:53.130
He gave me ten bucks.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.323
I'm sure.

22:54.347 --> 22:56.164
Are we missing something?

22:56.197 --> 22:58.573
Yeah, our anonymous
tipster was Scott Rowe,

22:58.824 --> 22:59.924
Our dead guy.

23:19.677 --> 23:20.677
Ooh!

23:21.444 --> 23:22.444
McGee.

23:22.759 --> 23:23.820
Did you lose something?

23:23.844 --> 23:27.543
Ugh! Tony still has not gotten
me back for the binoculars.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.510
I thought you two shook on
it-no more practical jokes.

23:35.244 --> 23:37.076
Do you trust DiNozzo?

23:37.260 --> 23:38.277
Point well taken.

23:38.610 --> 23:39.270
Where is he?

23:39.294 --> 23:41.619
The homicide detective
from Metro is here.

23:41.643 --> 23:43.744
He's, uh, escorting her up.

23:43.776 --> 23:46.219
Say one for me while
you're down there, McGee.

23:46.243 --> 23:47.569
Working on a theory, boss.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.043
How someone could've stolen
the radar without us seeing.

23:50.776 --> 23:52.636
- Yeah? Tell.
- I would rather show it to you,

23:52.660 --> 23:54.193
so I'm going to set up a demonstration

23:54.376 --> 23:56.360
out in the evidence garage.

23:58.126 --> 23:59.893
So our cases have crossed.

24:00.176 --> 24:00.753
Means you can tell me why

24:00.777 --> 24:03.577
NCIS was staking out the neighborhood.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.243
Classified navy equipment was hijacked.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.636
Got an anonymous tip it was in

24:06.660 --> 24:09.644
a storage building next to the
alley where Rowe was killed.

24:09.677 --> 24:12.310
Just learned Rowe was the tipster.

24:12.343 --> 24:14.243
Still conducting the stakeout?

24:14.277 --> 24:15.086
No.

24:15.110 --> 24:17.836
No. The equipment was stolen...

24:17.860 --> 24:18.860
again.

24:19.644 --> 24:20.485
Messy.

24:20.509 --> 24:21.509
Ziva David.

24:23.126 --> 24:24.619
You dragged me up here to pull

24:24.643 --> 24:26.303
the national security,
need-to-know card?

24:26.327 --> 24:28.652
That Rowe's murder is
no longer a Metro case?

24:28.676 --> 24:30.769
No. We investigate the murder together.

24:30.793 --> 24:32.502
The theft stays classified.

24:32.526 --> 24:34.744
Do I have a choice?

24:35.226 --> 24:36.226
No.

24:39.977 --> 24:40.977
Um...?

24:41.210 --> 24:42.644
Yeah. Don't ask.

24:43.577 --> 24:44.103
Hey.

24:44.127 --> 24:45.244
Sorry. Um, sorry.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.910
What did you say your name was again?

24:52.876 --> 24:53.877
Jardine.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.843
Four people in my department
have come down with the flu.

24:59.876 --> 25:01.710
You're in my department now.

25:01.744 --> 25:03.036
Yes, sir.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.303
What do you got?

25:04.327 --> 25:06.552
It's just a little tickle

25:06.576 --> 25:08.943
at the back of my throat, but it's...

25:10.576 --> 25:10.986
Oh.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.003
I did not pick up any chatter

25:13.027 --> 25:15.076
on the stolen dual-band radar.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.635
Talked with contacts at the NSA and CIA.

25:17.659 --> 25:19.043
They're alerted.

25:19.277 --> 25:20.943
- Where are we going?
- Interview.

25:20.976 --> 25:23.869
Don't talk. Just listen.

25:23.893 --> 25:26.176
Do you know him?

25:27.010 --> 25:29.060
Scott Rowe.

25:29.643 --> 25:30.826
Means nothing.

25:31.610 --> 25:32.610
Who is he?

25:32.644 --> 25:34.976
He's the man who tipped
us off to the radar.

25:35.010 --> 25:36.876
Well, is he cooperating?

25:36.909 --> 25:38.410
No, he's dead.

25:38.443 --> 25:40.243
Murdered.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.543
Okay, this just gets worse.

25:43.227 --> 25:44.286
You people have lost cutting-edge,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.310
dual-band technology.

25:46.343 --> 25:47.586
In the hands of a foreign government,

25:47.610 --> 25:48.569
it would be the biggest threat

25:48.593 --> 25:50.369
to national security since the Cold War.

25:50.393 --> 25:52.253
If they figure out how this thing works,

25:52.277 --> 25:53.909
they can jam it.

25:54.393 --> 25:56.143
You're the analyst.

25:56.176 --> 25:57.776
Has intel picked up anything?

25:58.809 --> 26:00.369
Well, if we get a lead,
we'll let you know.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.543
My company's ruined.

26:02.576 --> 26:03.736
We worked day and night to meet

26:03.760 --> 26:05.719
that original delivery schedule.

26:05.743 --> 26:08.710
By the time we could remanufacture...

26:09.344 --> 26:11.076
we'd lose the contract.

26:24.660 --> 26:25.744
Hey, McGee.

26:25.776 --> 26:27.510
Hey.

26:27.943 --> 26:29.043
What are you doing?

26:29.626 --> 26:30.793
It's a model.

26:31.077 --> 26:33.809
- That is really cool.
- Demonstration for Gibbs.

26:33.910 --> 26:36.577
You know how hard it is to
explain technical stuff to him.

26:36.610 --> 26:38.002
Yeah, good thinking.

26:38.026 --> 26:40.152
It's like every time I try
to explain something sciency,

26:40.176 --> 26:42.310
his eyes glaze over,
and he gives me that

26:42.343 --> 26:45.876
will you shut up and
get to the point look?

26:45.909 --> 26:48.176
He's behind me, isn't he?

26:49.410 --> 26:50.410
No.

26:53.372 --> 26:54.572
Want to see a dress rehearsal?

26:54.772 --> 26:55.972
- Can I be Gibbs?
- Yes.

26:57.172 --> 26:58.972
Okay, boss. Boss.

26:59.172 --> 27:00.272
This is the hallway.

27:00.472 --> 27:01.472
This is a locker.

27:01.772 --> 27:03.772
These are our surveillance cameras.

27:03.972 --> 27:05.672
Now if I could direct your attention

27:05.872 --> 27:06.872
to these monitors here.

27:06.972 --> 27:08.972
These are the feed from
the surveillance cameras.

27:10.072 --> 27:11.248
I'm working under the assumption

27:11.272 --> 27:13.472
that whoever stole the radar
knew that we were watching.

27:13.672 --> 27:14.372
Okay.

27:14.572 --> 27:16.672
Using a scanner, they
found our video frequencies.

27:16.872 --> 27:18.672
Had to be nearby, McGee?

27:18.772 --> 27:20.772
That is an excellent
question, boss. Uh, yes.

27:21.072 --> 27:22.152
With our mini-transmitters,

27:22.272 --> 27:23.972
they would have to be within 500 feet.

27:24.072 --> 27:26.572
Then they could steal and
record the video signals,

27:26.772 --> 27:27.872
which I have already done,

27:28.072 --> 27:32.272
and play them back with these
much more powerful transmitters.

27:32.572 --> 27:34.672
They would have overridden our signals.

27:34.872 --> 27:37.472
Now, they would need

27:37.672 --> 27:39.872
a pallet jack to get the radar out.

27:44.772 --> 27:46.072
McGee, I don't see the guy.

27:46.272 --> 27:47.972
That is because you
are watching the loop

27:48.172 --> 27:49.672
I made of the empty hallway,

27:49.872 --> 27:53.372
just as we were doing
during the stakeout.

27:58.172 --> 27:59.372
When they were gone,

27:59.972 --> 28:02.272
they turned off the loop in the hallway

28:02.572 --> 28:04.772
and continued transmitting
the second loop

28:05.072 --> 28:08.472
showing the radar still
in the storage locker.

28:09.872 --> 28:10.572
McGee,

28:10.772 --> 28:12.672
this is... this is so great!

28:12.872 --> 28:14.672
Even Gibbs could understand this.

28:14.872 --> 28:16.072
Oh, he does.

28:18.972 --> 28:20.172
Not off the hook...

28:21.472 --> 28:23.372
until the radar is found, McGee.

28:32.772 --> 28:36.172
Mr. Palmer, I thought
you'd gone for the night.

28:36.272 --> 28:38.172
I made it halfway home before I realized

28:38.372 --> 28:39.412
I left my cell phone here.

28:39.672 --> 28:41.572
What are you working on, Dr. Mallard?

28:41.772 --> 28:43.148
Is there anything I can help you with?

28:43.172 --> 28:45.872
No, no, no. It's an old
case just popped into mind.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.392
I thought I'd check a few things.

28:47.472 --> 28:48.648
Oh, I'll take that to
the file room for you.

28:48.672 --> 28:50.672
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll take care of it.

29:05.672 --> 29:08.072
I've worked all the
usual channels. Nothing.

29:08.272 --> 29:09.672
And you thought it was important

29:09.872 --> 29:11.372
to come up here and tell me that?

29:11.572 --> 29:12.572
Well, that's the point.

29:12.772 --> 29:14.872
If top-secret
electronics were out there

29:15.072 --> 29:16.972
for sale or in the hands
of a foreign operative,

29:17.172 --> 29:18.872
we would have picked
up something by now.

29:19.072 --> 29:21.672
I think the silence speaks volumes.

29:22.672 --> 29:23.672
What's it's saying?

29:24.572 --> 29:26.572
It suggests a domestic operation.

29:26.772 --> 29:28.672
If it's not out there for sale...

29:28.772 --> 29:31.572
A competitor of Jonathan Chow's company.

29:32.772 --> 29:33.772
Yeah. Gibbs.

29:39.372 --> 29:40.772
Mind if I ask what that is?

29:41.172 --> 29:43.252
According to McGee, he's
the guy who stole the radar.

29:49.172 --> 29:50.172
Um, Ziva?

29:51.272 --> 29:51.972
Huh?

29:52.072 --> 29:54.172
I don't know if I should
say anything or not,

29:54.272 --> 29:57.572
but I saw Tony putting
something under your car.

29:57.772 --> 29:58.572
What?

29:58.772 --> 29:59.972
When?

30:00.172 --> 30:01.472
What-I don't know.

30:01.572 --> 30:03.072
When-this morning.

30:04.972 --> 30:06.872
I told you, I told you
he could not be trusted.

30:08.772 --> 30:10.772
Was Tony really messing with her car?

30:11.972 --> 30:12.672
No.

30:12.872 --> 30:15.972
Tony just told me to tell
Ziva that when I saw her.

30:17.672 --> 30:20.672
Scott Rowe's prints were
lifted postmortem by the ME.

30:20.872 --> 30:23.172
This is the unidentified partial

30:23.372 --> 30:24.732
from the storage rental agreement.

30:27.272 --> 30:30.272
It matches Scott Rowe's
left index finger.

30:30.472 --> 30:31.172
Detective Sparr.

30:31.472 --> 30:32.872
Rowe rented the locker?

30:33.072 --> 30:34.592
- Probably hijacked the radar.
- Right.

30:34.772 --> 30:36.272
Then tipped us off where to find it?

30:36.472 --> 30:37.472
Doesn't make any sense.

30:37.672 --> 30:40.072
Our missing pusher, Dennis
Moran, he's been spotted downtown.

30:50.472 --> 30:51.472
Hey, thanks for the call.

30:51.572 --> 30:52.172
Where is he?

30:52.372 --> 30:54.372
Went into the hotel acting real hinky.

30:54.572 --> 30:55.572
There's a reward, right?

30:55.672 --> 30:56.872
Yes. You get him.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.372
I remember you.

30:58.572 --> 30:59.272
The biter.

30:59.472 --> 31:00.972
You stay here. You come with me.

31:01.072 --> 31:02.172
McGee, take the perimeter.

31:16.672 --> 31:18.272
NCIS! Freeze!

31:18.772 --> 31:20.072
Hey! Hold it!

31:24.672 --> 31:26.072
All right, just get away.

31:26.172 --> 31:27.372
Get away, okay?

31:27.872 --> 31:29.672
Federal agents. We just
want to talk, Dennis.

31:31.572 --> 31:32.172
No.

31:32.572 --> 31:33.772
I'm not going back to prison.

31:34.972 --> 31:36.472
- We just want to talk.
- No, no.

31:36.572 --> 31:38.572
You... no, you think I
kill... I killed that guy.

31:38.672 --> 31:40.872
I didn't, okay? I didn't.

31:41.072 --> 31:42.572
Then why did you run, Dennis?

31:43.372 --> 31:45.072
I'm on probation.

31:45.172 --> 31:47.472
I get convicted again, and it's over.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.972
It's not gonna happen.

31:57.072 --> 31:58.072
Dennis!

31:59.472 --> 32:00.572
It's not gonna happen.

32:01.872 --> 32:03.972
Dennis? Dennis, you
don't want to do this.

32:05.872 --> 32:07.272
Don't make us do this Dennis.

32:07.672 --> 32:08.672
Put the gun down!

32:08.972 --> 32:10.172
Dennis!

32:14.772 --> 32:16.872
Oh, God, stop it!

32:17.972 --> 32:19.372
I didn't kill anybody.

32:19.672 --> 32:20.772
I swear I didn't.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.372
I didn't kill anybody, I swear.

32:27.072 --> 32:28.972
I swear I didn't do it.

32:42.654 --> 32:43.854
What were you doing with Rowe?

32:44.480 --> 32:45.480
Who?

32:45.754 --> 32:47.654
Dead guy in the alley.

32:47.854 --> 32:50.754
I told you I didn't kill him.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.654
You want me to start believing you,

32:52.754 --> 32:53.754
Dennis,

32:55.454 --> 32:57.154
you better start remembering things.

32:57.654 --> 32:59.454
I'm-I'm-I'm trying.

33:00.454 --> 33:02.254
Gibbs alway throw softballs?

33:02.654 --> 33:05.154
I've seen him make a
300-pound drill instructor cry.

33:05.254 --> 33:06.754
How long did you know him?

33:06.954 --> 33:08.054
I didn't.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.354
The guy showed up a couple days ago.

33:10.754 --> 33:12.754
Paid me two bills to watch a building.

33:12.854 --> 33:13.954
Storage facility.

33:14.054 --> 33:14.754
Yeah.

33:14.954 --> 33:17.354
He told me, uh,

33:17.554 --> 33:19.554
he gave me a number to
call him when the feds came.

33:21.854 --> 33:22.854
They came for what?

33:23.354 --> 33:24.954
I don't know.

33:25.154 --> 33:26.854
He was... he was crazy.

33:26.954 --> 33:29.054
Said the place was going to get raided.

33:29.154 --> 33:30.354
I never saw nothing.

33:30.554 --> 33:32.054
Who hit him with the pipe?

33:35.654 --> 33:38.054
I don't know, I don't know
who killed... who hit him.

33:38.554 --> 33:39.754
You were there.

33:44.154 --> 33:45.254
I was loaded, man.

33:46.354 --> 33:47.554
The...

33:48.054 --> 33:49.854
the BMW dude was hassling me

33:50.154 --> 33:51.354
for not calling.

33:51.554 --> 33:53.154
We went into the alley.

33:54.354 --> 33:55.954
That other guy was there.

33:56.154 --> 33:59.154
He saw him... went crazy.

33:59.354 --> 34:00.730
Picked up the pipe and
started hitting him.

34:00.754 --> 34:02.254
You know, I-I got the hell out.

34:03.032 --> 34:04.732
Can you describe the other guy?

34:08.032 --> 34:09.732
I was so whacked, man.

34:12.232 --> 34:14.431
He couldn't pick his own
mother out of a lineup.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.732
You believe this junkie?

34:19.032 --> 34:19.831
He had a gun.

34:19.931 --> 34:20.931
Why use a pipe?

34:22.831 --> 34:23.831
Escort him back down

34:23.931 --> 34:25.692
- to sick bay lockup.
- I have a better idea.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.132
I take him downtown.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.532
Civilian vic, civilian suspect

34:29.632 --> 34:30.331
on a Metro street.

34:30.532 --> 34:32.232
- Not yet.
- Why?

34:34.331 --> 34:35.331
National Security?

34:37.132 --> 34:38.331
Works for me.

34:41.532 --> 34:43.032
Great. Lunch.

34:43.532 --> 34:44.632
I'm starving!

34:45.132 --> 34:47.308
Nikki, there's an extra burger
in there if you want one.

34:47.331 --> 34:48.232
Oh, no, thanks.

34:48.331 --> 34:49.772
I don't eat food prepared by others.

34:49.831 --> 34:51.132
Of course you don't.

34:51.431 --> 34:52.931
Did you come up with anything?

34:53.032 --> 34:54.132
Nothing. No connection.

34:54.331 --> 34:56.032
Oh, by the way, who do I owe?

34:56.232 --> 34:57.232
Tony.

34:58.032 --> 34:59.032
Tony?

34:59.132 --> 35:00.832
Where is he?

35:00.932 --> 35:02.232
Interrogation.

35:02.432 --> 35:03.432
Hah!

35:06.032 --> 35:07.532
Ah, does he think I'm that stupid?

35:08.932 --> 35:09.732
Come on.

35:09.932 --> 35:11.532
Would Tony really do something

35:11.632 --> 35:13.032
- to your food?
- Oh, yeah.

35:13.632 --> 35:14.632
Boss,

35:15.420 --> 35:17.140
we went through Scott
Rowe's bank statements

35:17.220 --> 35:18.220
and brokerage accounts.

35:18.320 --> 35:21.920
He sold 50,000 shares of IRT,
Jonathan Chow's company, short.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.820
He was betting the stock would fall.

35:24.020 --> 35:25.220
- Why?
- Don't know.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.620
Settlement date's this Friday.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.420
Hard to make a killing on the market

35:28.520 --> 35:29.520
when you're dead.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.320
Insider information.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.720
We're checking for a
connection between Rowe, Chow

35:33.820 --> 35:35.220
or anyone at IRT.

35:38.820 --> 35:40.020
SECNAV wants a briefing.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.420
You stay on it.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.696
It could have been anyone
who knew about the theft.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.420
Including Captain Pullman.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.720
You ready, Dr. Mallard?

35:59.020 --> 36:01.320
As ready as I ever will be.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.220
We have put this bloody
business off long enough.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.440
They don't prepare you for
all this in medical school.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.120
Yeah, well, let's get it over with.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.820
Where shall we start?

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
Latex gloves?

36:14.920 --> 36:16.920
Good Lord.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.620
Do we really get through that many?

36:18.720 --> 36:19.820
Requisition forms.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.920
I did mine last week.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.120
Don't gloat.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.320
Okay. All business.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.820
I got the blood work you
wanted on the John Doe.

36:27.020 --> 36:28.720
Um, the white blood
cell count was normal,

36:28.820 --> 36:32.120
but there was a high level
of the enzyme creatine kinase.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.820
Uh...

36:34.020 --> 36:35.220
I- I didn't realize

36:35.320 --> 36:36.420
how late it was.

36:36.620 --> 36:40.020
Um, let's put all that off
until tomorrow, Mr. Palmer,

36:40.220 --> 36:41.920
when we're both fresh.

36:42.020 --> 36:43.520
I guess one more day won't matter.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.020
Yes, well, thank you, Abigail.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.220
I'll see you in the morning.

36:51.020 --> 36:51.720
What's going on?

36:51.920 --> 36:53.120
I don't know.

36:53.220 --> 36:55.120
He asked me to run blood
tests on a John Doe.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.420
Abby, we don't have any John Does.

37:06.820 --> 37:07.820
No.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.720
Sleep through your alarm, Tony?

37:09.920 --> 37:11.520
I wish. Morning, Boss.

37:11.720 --> 37:12.920
Morning, McProbious.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.220
Well, we got the dirt on Rowe.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.260
Whoever killed him might
have done him a favor.

37:17.420 --> 37:18.860
He was going to file for bankruptcy.

37:18.920 --> 37:19.920
We met with his attorney.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.496
Also interviewed the broker who placed

37:21.520 --> 37:22.920
the short sale of IRT stock.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.496
Says he tried to talk Rowe out of it.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.760
Pretty sure the broker's clean.

37:25.820 --> 37:26.620
We caught him off guard,

37:26.820 --> 37:28.420
jogging at Rock Creek Park.

37:28.620 --> 37:30.120
At 6:15 this morning.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.620
It was good old-fashioned

37:31.820 --> 37:34.120
legwork, Ziva, it usually solves crimes.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.420
Well, sometimes computers

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
do help, Tony.

37:36.620 --> 37:37.820
I wrote a program

37:38.020 --> 37:39.620
to cross-check credit card charges,

37:39.820 --> 37:41.720
ran Scott Rowe's against corporate cards

37:41.920 --> 37:43.020
issued to IRT execs,

37:43.320 --> 37:45.720
limited my search parameters
to the last six months

37:45.920 --> 37:46.996
- under the assumption...
- McGee!

37:47.020 --> 37:48.720
Sorry, boss. Just got a hit.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.420
Five weeks ago, Scott Rowe's
and Jonathan Chow's credit cards

37:53.620 --> 37:55.620
were swiped at the same Georgetown bar

37:55.820 --> 37:57.120
within minutes of each other.

37:57.220 --> 37:59.120
Both were also waited
on by the same server.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.920
Suggests they sat next to each other.

38:01.020 --> 38:02.320
Huh. Maybe that's how they met.

38:02.520 --> 38:03.796
It's like the Hitchcock classic,

38:03.820 --> 38:04.820
Strangers on a Train.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.920
Two men, who don't know
each other, meet by chance

38:07.020 --> 38:08.220
to hatch a nefarious crime.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.420
Chow's a Caltech graduate.

38:10.520 --> 38:11.596
It would have been a
piece of cake for him

38:11.620 --> 38:13.296
to block and override
our surveillance signal.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.820
Chow denied knowing Rowe.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.120
Rowe's dead. He can't talk.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.920
The fact that two guys

38:18.120 --> 38:19.596
had a drink at a bar at the same time

38:19.620 --> 38:20.820
doesn't really prove anything.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
Get Moran back in here.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.120
He couldn't ID anybody.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.420
And even if he did, he's
not a reliable witness.

38:27.620 --> 38:28.620
Agreed.

38:51.820 --> 38:52.920
You the guy that called me?

38:54.120 --> 38:55.220
Sit down.

38:55.720 --> 38:56.720
Uh...

38:57.020 --> 38:58.920
you were kind of cryptic on the phone.

39:01.007 --> 39:02.107
Sit down.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.607
I don't think you want
me talking too loud.

39:05.807 --> 39:07.683
Look, I think you're
mistaking me for someone else.

39:07.707 --> 39:09.107
I know exactly who you are.

39:11.107 --> 39:12.607
I saw you hit Rowe with a pipe.

39:15.307 --> 39:16.707
What are you talking about?

39:18.807 --> 39:19.807
Told me he...

39:20.207 --> 39:22.407
met you here five weeks ago.

39:25.607 --> 39:27.207
What do you want?

39:27.707 --> 39:30.007
How much is the question.

39:32.507 --> 39:33.507
Sit down.

39:44.607 --> 39:46.807
I know about your arrangement.

39:47.407 --> 39:49.207
How much do you want?

39:51.507 --> 39:52.607
50 thou.

39:56.507 --> 39:58.507
How do I know you're not
going to double-cross me

39:58.607 --> 39:59.607
like Rowe did?

40:00.907 --> 40:02.707
Is that why you killed him?

40:05.407 --> 40:06.407
It's going to...

40:06.607 --> 40:09.807
it's going to take me a little
while to come up with the money.

40:12.007 --> 40:13.107
Got till tomorrow.

40:32.507 --> 40:34.307
You got a lot of 'splaining to do.

40:35.007 --> 40:37.907
Too bad you couldn't
block this transmission.

40:40.707 --> 40:41.707
He's all yours.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.927
You're under arrest for
the murder of Scott Rowe.

40:45.807 --> 40:47.247
You have the right to remain silent.

40:47.607 --> 40:48.883
Anything you say can and will be

40:48.907 --> 40:50.307
used against you in a court of law.

40:50.807 --> 40:53.107
You think this will help
me out with the judge?

40:55.307 --> 40:56.307
I think you did great.

40:57.207 --> 40:58.507
Jonathan Chow

40:58.607 --> 41:00.307
had his own radar system stolen?

41:02.107 --> 41:03.107
Why?

41:03.307 --> 41:04.307
It didn't work.

41:04.707 --> 41:06.083
There was a fatal glitch in the software

41:06.107 --> 41:07.007
that controlled the radar.

41:07.107 --> 41:08.107
As a result,

41:08.207 --> 41:09.767
the programming for all the integrated,

41:09.807 --> 41:11.407
multifunction peripheral components

41:11.607 --> 41:12.607
had to be rewritten.

41:12.807 --> 41:15.107
It would have taken mon... months.

41:16.507 --> 41:17.507
Where's the radar now?

41:17.907 --> 41:18.707
Back of a truck.

41:18.907 --> 41:20.987
Chow left it in long-term
parking at Reagan National.

41:21.407 --> 41:23.507
Well, I guess it's not going
to do the navy much good

41:23.607 --> 41:24.607
if it doesn't work.

41:26.507 --> 41:27.607
Nope.

41:27.707 --> 41:28.507
Rowe would have made a fortune

41:28.607 --> 41:29.107
on the stock market

41:29.207 --> 41:31.507
when the navy discovered
the radar didn't work.

41:31.707 --> 41:32.883
A whole lot more than Chow paid him

41:32.907 --> 41:33.983
to steal it in the first place.

41:34.007 --> 41:36.207
Rowe tips us off, Chow freaks,

41:36.407 --> 41:38.207
steals the radar back, kills Rowe.

41:38.507 --> 41:39.907
Not our finest moment.

41:40.107 --> 41:43.307
If I never go on stakeout
again it will be too soon.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.307
Should I prep now?

41:59.407 --> 42:00.607
No time like the present.

42:01.607 --> 42:02.907
I'll get changed.

42:05.407 --> 42:07.007
Ah, a new arrival.

42:07.207 --> 42:08.807
Two-pack-a-day gunny.

42:09.007 --> 42:11.007
Died of a suspected
heart attack last night.

42:11.107 --> 42:13.807
They're not all murders, Jethro.

42:14.407 --> 42:15.607
Hey, Palmer.

42:15.907 --> 42:16.807
Abby's looking for you.

42:16.907 --> 42:17.907
I just left her.

42:20.907 --> 42:22.407
I will go see her again.

42:29.107 --> 42:30.107
Is something wrong?

42:31.507 --> 42:33.007
Well, you tell me.

42:33.207 --> 42:34.407
I thought

42:34.607 --> 42:36.507
we didn't keep secrets from each other.

42:36.807 --> 42:39.507
Oh, you're referring to the blood tests

42:39.707 --> 42:42.407
I asked Abby to run on
the nonexistent John Doe.

42:42.707 --> 42:44.507
And so I shouldn't be surprised-

42:44.807 --> 42:46.407
she goes to you with everything.

42:46.707 --> 42:48.227
She cares about you and she's worried.

42:49.107 --> 42:50.307
About me?

42:50.507 --> 42:52.107
You were running the tests on yourself.

42:52.407 --> 42:55.407
No, I am not self-diagnosing.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.507
You know, Abby allows her emotions

42:57.807 --> 42:59.407
to cloud her judgment.

42:59.607 --> 43:00.907
She jumps to a conclusion.

43:01.407 --> 43:02.807
No, I'm in excellent health

43:02.907 --> 43:04.107
for a man of my age.

43:04.307 --> 43:05.867
And if she'd bothered to check further,

43:05.907 --> 43:07.607
she'd have realized
it's not my blood type.

43:08.707 --> 43:09.707
Who?

43:15.307 --> 43:18.307
You're putting me in a very
difficult position, Jethro.

43:19.507 --> 43:21.107
I can't think of anybody

43:21.307 --> 43:23.507
you'd stick your neck out like that for.

43:27.607 --> 43:28.907
Except...

43:30.007 --> 43:31.307
Director Shepard.

43:36.107 --> 43:37.507
Huh? Jenny?
