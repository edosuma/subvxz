00:05.673 --> 00:08.968
"Surveys show that 46% of women
are thinking of someone else

00:09.051 --> 00:12.388
when having sex with their partners.
Only 42% of men do so."

00:13.848 --> 00:15.391
Your turn first.

00:19.562 --> 00:20.646
I'm next.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.993
Well, I get the last one.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.662
Now, the moment of truth.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.248
Please, don't forget to use a condom.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.003
Those are my keys.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.257
Good. First match of the night.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.012
Those are my keys.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.686
These keys are certainly not ours.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.275
I guess these are yours, comrade.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.402
They are.

01:08.486 --> 01:11.280
Ladies and gentlemen, go ahead.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.574
We're staying here.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.285
- Shall we?
- Okay.

01:20.790 --> 01:21.791
I love you.

01:29.048 --> 01:31.759
THE GAME OF KEYS

01:37.264 --> 01:39.642
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. You?

01:39.934 --> 01:41.393
- I'm okay.
- Good.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.315
Oh, my God!

01:48.818 --> 01:50.778
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.239
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.532
It's okay.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.452
Okay.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.538
Let's go to my place.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.164
Okay.

02:08.170 --> 02:10.130
I booked a room at the Mirador Hotel.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.092
- I hope you like it.
- I love that hotel.

02:13.592 --> 02:17.680
We held a wedding there.
And the view is breathtaking.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.141
- Well, I'm glad you like it.
- Thanks.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.248
Where are we going?

02:44.331 --> 02:48.419
I know a boutique hotel
where they produce their own mezcal.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.256
- I had something else in mind.
- Like what?

02:52.548 --> 02:56.760
The place where Che and Castro
plotted the Cuban Revolution?

02:57.636 --> 02:59.763
No. Somewhere else.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.772
Don't be shy, babe?
Touch me like you mean it.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.821
I feel like you and I are going
to get along just fine.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.200
- Are you ready?
- I am.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.165
Let's go.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.605
Why? Turn it on.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.440
This is how I like it.

04:00.658 --> 04:01.867
I want to see you.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.203
You are beautiful.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.850
What's wrong?

04:27.810 --> 04:29.019
Nothing.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.163
I can't do it.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.917
Are you okay?

04:56.046 --> 04:59.633
I've only had sex with Óscar.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.223
Relax. We don't have to do it.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.475
I'm sorry.

05:10.728 --> 05:14.064
Have you really just fucked Óscar?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.069
Isn't it boring?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.698
We have our ups and downs.

05:28.454 --> 05:29.455
Hey?

05:30.873 --> 05:33.417
Óscar is screwing
someone else tonight.

05:35.085 --> 05:38.422
No. Óscar would never do that.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.758
Get out, baby girl. Please.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.926
Make yourself at home, Little Óscar.

05:43.010 --> 05:47.222
Do not Little Óscar me.
That's what Adriana calls my...

05:51.560 --> 05:52.686
I'm sorry.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.606
- To be honest...
- Listen.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.692
I'm going to change my clothes...

05:59.693 --> 06:01.445
and we'll see what we can do.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.363
It's funny, isn't it?

06:03.572 --> 06:06.909
We've known each other since school,
we've been through a lot.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.411
We've shared a lot.
Nothing sexual, of course.

06:09.578 --> 06:12.122
- But it's still funny.
- Same here.

06:13.082 --> 06:16.710
I mean, it's been ages
since we know each other...

06:17.836 --> 06:21.465
And you're my wife's best friend...

06:24.218 --> 06:26.887
And Mica's godmother...

06:27.679 --> 06:30.432
We're going to have so much fun...

06:38.607 --> 06:40.400
Big Óscar!

06:43.946 --> 06:46.073
It's so cute.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.493
It's leaning left.

07:07.928 --> 07:08.887
My God!

07:15.060 --> 07:17.104
I love oysters.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.275
I thought
an aphrodisiac dinner would be...

07:22.860 --> 07:24.611
interesting. Don't you think?

07:28.448 --> 07:31.243
- More?
- Some more. Please.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.247
Cheers.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.708
To new experiences.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.460
Cheers.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.715
Can I ask you a question?

07:45.215 --> 07:46.300
Sure.

07:49.386 --> 07:53.182
Why did you give me that look
the other night?

07:53.348 --> 07:55.559
Me? Really?

07:59.563 --> 08:03.442
Maybe because
you were my crush at school.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.736
- Yeah, sure.
- What?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.321
I wasn't!

08:07.696 --> 08:08.989
Yes, you were.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.366
I had feelings for you.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.078
You only approached me
to get my homework.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.707
I did.
You were the brightest girl I knew.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.835
And you've always been beautiful.

08:25.172 --> 08:30.052
I was in your mind
while you were surrounded by chicks?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.304
It wasn't like that, either.

08:32.804 --> 08:33.847
But...

08:35.182 --> 08:36.391
It's true.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.519
Why didn't you tell me?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.233
I don't know.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.568
I never thought you...

08:47.694 --> 08:48.946
It wasn't the right time.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.449
Then you started dating Óscar.

08:53.742 --> 08:54.910
Can you imagine...

08:56.119 --> 08:57.371
if we had tried?

08:58.247 --> 09:02.626
No. We had nothing in common.
We still don't.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.295
Maybe that's what we need.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.381
I mean...

09:08.173 --> 09:09.383
What we needed.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.276
My God, Leo!

09:29.444 --> 09:31.029
Oh, yeah.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.992
Win me over, baby.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.328
Keep going, Leo.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.249
That tongue of yours...

09:46.545 --> 09:49.381
- Fuck!
- I can't fucking believe it.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.351
Hello, gentleman. Is everything okay?

10:01.435 --> 10:02.394
Everything okay.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.606
Do you have
your license and registration?

10:06.857 --> 10:09.443
Yes, I do.
But, you can't see them.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.863
I'm afraid I have to give you
a ticket for misconduct.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.489
I'm afraid you can't.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.034
Under article 16th
of the Constitution,

10:17.159 --> 10:20.620
no person may be disturbed
in his home or private property

10:20.620 --> 10:23.999
except by virtue of a written order
by the corresponding authority,

10:24.082 --> 10:26.543
establishing legal cause of action.

10:26.626 --> 10:31.006
We're in my car, which is
my property. So, please leave.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.634
But your car is on the street,
which is Federal property.

10:36.762 --> 10:40.891
Owning the land is an interesting
but twisted concept.

10:41.099 --> 10:44.478
- I totally agree.
- Look, sir. Let's do this.

10:45.896 --> 10:49.566
You seem a decent gentleman,
just like the lady.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.777
Maybe we could...

10:52.736 --> 10:54.196
We could sort this out.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.076
- You want money, filthy pig?
- Leo!

11:00.369 --> 11:01.328
Leo!

11:01.995 --> 11:04.539
- Relax, man.
- You're just a Fascist pig.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.542
You represent everything
that's fucked up in this country!

11:08.210 --> 11:10.754
- Relax, sir.
- I am relaxed.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.256
But corruption upsets me.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.842
It's worse than anything
that has happened inside this car!

11:17.219 --> 11:19.638
You are the only criminal here.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.432
- Enough! Take him!
- Take your hands off me, pig!

11:22.516 --> 11:25.685
- He didn't mean that.
- I did mean that.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.856
They're fucking Fascist pigs!
Take your hands off me, pig!

11:29.940 --> 11:33.318
I've just witnessed
a terrible case of police abuse.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.028
They're taking him with them.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.116
Siena!

11:42.160 --> 11:44.246
Text me when you are there.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.790
Sure, go.
We're on our way there.

11:46.957 --> 11:47.874
Bye.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.169
- What happened?
- Your friend Leonardo was arrested

11:51.253 --> 11:53.880
for misconduct
and assaulting an officer.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.340
- You're kidding.
- No.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.634
- I'm not. Shall we?
- Sure, let's go.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.178
I don't know where I left my phone.

12:04.433 --> 12:07.894
- What?
- Well, we had dinner...

12:08.603 --> 12:10.063
we've been drinking...

12:10.856 --> 12:12.899
but we haven't fucked yet!

12:15.152 --> 12:16.695
Sure, you're right.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.656
No. I'm sorry, Valentín. It's just...

12:19.739 --> 12:21.408
No, I'm sorry.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.668
Valentín!

12:34.004 --> 12:35.755
You're so tidy.

12:36.465 --> 12:37.799
Yes.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.427
You are beautiful.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.852
You are very beautiful.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.422
- What?
- Hello?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.674
What?

13:20.884 --> 13:22.594
You're fucking kidding me!

13:24.304 --> 13:26.806
You're kidding me.
Just 5,000 views? It sucks.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.934
- Siena, is everything okay?
- What's up?

13:29.142 --> 13:32.103
We were fucking in the car
and everything got fucked up.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.981
- In the car?
- It's not exactly a crime,

13:35.065 --> 13:38.026
and we wanted to fuck there.
But an officer showed up.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.487
He tried to bribe us,
and Leo went berserk.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.907
Everything will be fine
as long as we stay calm.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.785
- Maybe we can bail him out.
- I know, but Leo lost it.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.245
Where is Leo?

13:48.370 --> 13:50.830
We don't know yet, maybe in jail.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.500
- What happened?
- He was arrested.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.669
- Why?
- We were fucking in the car.

13:55.752 --> 13:59.297
Relax, Bárbara.
Let's ask her what happened.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.716
- May I ask who you're looking for?
- Hi.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.345
Can I have information
on Mr. Leonardo Cuevas? I'm his wife.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.930
I want to see him.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.307
Can you bring him over,
or can you let me in?

14:09.391 --> 14:12.269
- Relax, lady!
- I'm so relaxed!

14:12.394 --> 14:13.645
You've been drinking.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.564
What does that have
to do with anything?

14:15.647 --> 14:18.024
Bárbara, Bárbara.
Hey, relax. Let me handle it.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.859
Can you tell me

14:20.151 --> 14:23.405
whether my friend
has testified to anything?

14:24.906 --> 14:25.907
I don't know.

14:25.991 --> 14:29.202
Can you tell us anything,
so we don't stand here like fools?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.997
Wait until the officer is back.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.834
- When will that be?
- I'll call my lawyer.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.002
Yeah, sure.

14:40.005 --> 14:43.216
- What happened? Is everything okay?
- They are taking care of it.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.385
Hey! How did it go?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.722
- Fine. It was fine.
- Fine?

14:48.805 --> 14:51.725
Tell me more. I love
first-time stories. I'm listening.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.685
Wait. Did you have sex?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.024
- Honey...
- Fuck!

14:59.232 --> 15:02.193
Wait. Wasn't that the point?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.279
- That was the idea, sure.
- Enough, Siena!

15:04.404 --> 15:07.574
- You and Sergio didn't have sex?
- No, we didn't.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.367
- Why?
- I don't know.

15:09.451 --> 15:13.997
Because you told me so much crap
about marriage so I couldn't do it.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.250
- I'm so disappointed.
- I did want.

15:17.626 --> 15:21.129
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- You fucking my best friend?

15:21.296 --> 15:24.341
Didn't you say
you wanted to try new experiences?

15:24.799 --> 15:26.926
We did what we were supposed to.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.137
We had agreed to it.
It was your idea.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.140
- But I never thought you would.
- Why not?

15:32.641 --> 15:35.727
Because you don't fuck
your best friend's husband.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.355
Adriana, that's what this game
is about.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.607
If that's the point, then...

15:41.066 --> 15:43.818
Adriana, wait. Don't get mad.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.197
- Had it been someone else...
- What's going on here?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.992
You fuck Gabriela
and I have to pretend it's okay.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.162
Listen. I did want to.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.122
Either you shut up
or I'll lock you up!

16:03.463 --> 16:05.840
Get us out of here,
you motherfuckers.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.802
Sergio, are you stretching out?

16:09.135 --> 16:12.806
Otherwise your back
will start hurting.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.644
- Yes, I'm stretching out.
- Oh, poor little thing.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.690
This country will go straight to hell

16:21.773 --> 16:25.318
thanks to the fascists
in charge of our judicial system!

16:28.405 --> 16:30.448
Maybe we are trending topic by now.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.534
Shut up, Siena.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.495
Why should I? It's your fault
that we were locked up.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.331
My fault?
You were fucking in the street.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.876
Yes, I was having sex with Leo.
And you know what, Bárbara?

16:41.960 --> 16:46.047
Congratulations.
Leo's tongue is magic.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.885
- Did you hear that, honey?
- What?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.054
Move it, blondie.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.224
Your tongue is magic.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.310
That guy is fucking that girl.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.604
But he's married
to that lady over there.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.940
He's such a lucky guy!

17:04.149 --> 17:06.651
Why is that girl there all crazy?

17:06.735 --> 17:08.820
She didn't fuck
with this blondie here

17:08.903 --> 17:11.114
who looks like "Brayan" Gosling.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.033
You know why?
Because he couldn't...

17:14.117 --> 17:17.245
That's not true, dude!
It wasn't like that.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.458
This tragedy is worse
than RBD's soap opera.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.794
He didn't get a boner.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.341
No. Wait, officer.
We're in the middle of something.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.303
Get the hell out of here! Come on!

17:33.386 --> 17:35.513
- It has just started.
- Blondie?

17:36.598 --> 17:38.183
I hope your back gets better.

17:38.683 --> 17:41.895
- Fuckers.
- Goodbye, handsome. Get well soon.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.857
What about us?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.109
You can't stop, can you?

17:53.364 --> 17:55.575
This fucking game was a crappy idea.

19:16.239 --> 19:18.533
- Where have you been?
- Ask your father.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.744
- You don't even answer your phone.
- He'll tell you why.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.999
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.919
I'm sorry.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.303
- Good morning.
- Hello, Mommy!

19:38.386 --> 19:42.265
Not so loud, honey.
I have a headache.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.268
- Good morning, Carmen.
- Good morning.

19:46.895 --> 19:50.148
- Since when do the kids eat fruit?
- Since I'm in charge.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.944
Carmen, thank you
for staying with the kids.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.654
Someone has to take care of them.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.365
- Sit and have breakfast.
- How did it go, Mom?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.035
Not so good?

20:06.789 --> 20:09.375
This fucking game was a stupid idea.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.170
Let's leave this behind.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.547
Hell no!

20:16.925 --> 20:18.468
We're going to play again.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.431
- What do you mean?
- You fucked Gaby and I...

20:24.557 --> 20:29.145
- I deserve one chance.
- You had your chance, Adriana!

20:29.479 --> 20:31.230
But you screwed it up for me!

20:31.773 --> 20:34.567
And you ended up having wild sex.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.116
Did you?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.456
- Did you have wild sex?
- Stop it.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.125
Óscar, answer me.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.799
You can tell me.
I won't get upset, I promise.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.592
Honey, please. Stop.

21:01.302 --> 21:02.470
Óscar?

21:03.805 --> 21:07.600
Is it so hard to say yes or no?

21:07.684 --> 21:12.105
I had really wild sex with Gaby.
Are you happy now?

21:14.649 --> 21:15.733
Fuck!

21:19.153 --> 21:22.365
This was the last time, okay?

21:23.324 --> 21:24.867
I'm exhausted!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.161
Hey?

21:28.037 --> 21:29.872
Tell me, how was last night?

21:31.874 --> 21:34.711
Let's say Valentín
is a perfect gentleman.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.295
Is he?

21:36.921 --> 21:39.799
Kind of boring. And you?

21:41.843 --> 21:43.720
- What?
- How did it go?

21:44.387 --> 21:49.851
It was going great,
until those stupid pigs showed up.

21:51.394 --> 21:54.897
- And they ruined it.
- Siena seemed satisfied.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.065
See?

21:56.149 --> 21:59.235
She was surprised
by your oral skills.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.072
Will you unzip me, please?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.034
There you go.

22:06.534 --> 22:10.580
Are you going to tell me what you did
to that 20-year-old doll?

22:10.997 --> 22:14.208
Do you want me to tell you,
or shall I show you?

22:15.168 --> 22:16.335
Show me...

22:16.544 --> 22:18.546
She's going to be full of energy now.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.216
Hello, baby girl.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.010
Come here.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.223
Do you want to go for a walk?

22:30.141 --> 22:32.143
- Now?
- Yes.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.687
Not now, honey. Please.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.691
No, I want to talk.
Tell me how it went.

22:39.192 --> 22:42.403
What was it like having sex
with Bárbara? How do you feel?

22:43.154 --> 22:44.864
Let me take her for a walk.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.244
Okay. But hurry,
or you'll find me sleeping.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.921
Being in jail
is a life-changing experience.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.006
While being there, I've learned

23:02.090 --> 23:05.843
that our unfairly imprisoned
brothers and sisters

23:06.219 --> 23:09.764
live a miserable life.
They lack food and clothing...

23:10.139 --> 23:13.893
Siena, come on.
Please, stop. I need some sleep.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.979
What, Sergio?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.023
Are you cranky for the lack of sex?

23:19.107 --> 23:22.360
It could be that,
or that I've been awake for 27 hours.

23:23.027 --> 23:26.114
- Come on, please.
- Or maybe you're moody...

23:26.405 --> 23:30.451
because you couldn't screw
your school crush?

23:30.535 --> 23:32.203
I'll get over it.

23:33.663 --> 23:37.792
What if we pretend I'm
a 17-year-old Adriana and you're you?

23:38.543 --> 23:42.588
Hello.
I'm Adriana, I'm 17 years old...

23:43.005 --> 23:48.302
My parents are out of town
this weekend.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.931
- I'll be home alone.
- Stop it, Siena.

23:54.142 --> 23:58.688
I'd love that you could study Algebra
with me.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.150
I need to know
the difference between cosine...

24:02.275 --> 24:04.861
- My God!
- ...and sine.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.239
- Please?
- Cosine and sine...

24:08.322 --> 24:09.407
Good!

24:21.127 --> 24:22.670
- Hi, there!
- Hello.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.463
May I help you?

24:25.006 --> 24:28.426
I wanted to ask if you have the service
to bathe a dog, at their home.

24:28.593 --> 24:32.221
- Yes. Sure. Here is my card.
- Yes, thank you.

24:32.430 --> 24:33.347
Here.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.267
OK. Do you take
the camper with you?

24:36.642 --> 24:38.144
Well, it's optional.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.063
- I rather not.
- I'm Valentín.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.274
- I'm Pedro.
- Nice to meet you.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.948
Thanks, Mary. These ingredients
are for Mr. Valentín's juice.
