WEBVTT

00:02.661 --> 00:04.074
Hey, will you steam
my uniform next?

00:04.099 --> 00:05.047
Yeah, w...

00:05.048 --> 00:06.330
Interesting.

00:06.332 --> 00:07.948
Do you recall this conversation?

00:07.950 --> 00:10.301
"Leonard, want to go halfsies
on a steamer?"

00:10.303 --> 00:13.504
"No, Sheldon,
we don't need a steamer."

00:14.640 --> 00:16.891
Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

00:17.759 --> 00:19.126
Hi.

00:19.128 --> 00:20.645
Here are the make-up sponges
you asked for.

00:20.647 --> 00:22.914
Oh, thanks,
I thought I had more.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.686
Damn, you've got
more makeup than I do.

00:28.688 --> 00:31.606
You've got better makeup
than I do.

00:31.608 --> 00:33.524
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

00:33.526 --> 00:34.609
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:34.611 --> 00:35.976
This is my Comic-Con makeup.

00:35.978 --> 00:38.196
I love you,
but there are some things

00:38.198 --> 00:40.081
a man doesn't share
with his girlfriend.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.334
That's a wise policy.

00:43.336 --> 00:44.985
I once borrowed
my sister's makeup

00:44.987 --> 00:46.170
for a costume contest.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.788
Got a terrible case of pinkeye.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.790
Yeah, but luckily,
I was going as a zombie.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.676
I won second place.

00:51.678 --> 00:54.795
I feel like you guys
just went to Comic-Con.

00:54.797 --> 00:55.829
That was San Diego Comic-Con.

00:55.831 --> 00:57.965
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

00:57.967 --> 00:59.634
Is that better?

00:59.636 --> 01:00.935
Well, it's a lot smaller.

01:00.937 --> 01:02.019
It's more about
the comic books.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.521
The way these
conventions used to be

01:03.523 --> 01:05.355
before they went
all Hollywood.

01:05.358 --> 01:08.309
So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.728
Well, then why are you going?

01:10.730 --> 01:12.630
It's a comic book convention.

01:12.632 --> 01:14.982
You know, it's like pizza
or particle accelerators,

01:14.984 --> 01:17.485
even the stinky one's
still pretty good.

01:17.487 --> 01:18.703
All right.

01:18.705 --> 01:19.704
Well, you guys have fun.

01:19.706 --> 01:20.854
I guess I'll see you
Sunday night.

01:20.856 --> 01:22.022
Yeah.
Okay.

01:22.024 --> 01:23.524
Oh, hang on a second.

01:23.526 --> 01:25.710
Hold this.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.831
What was that for?

01:30.833 --> 01:33.634
To show people
when they don't believe me.

02:04.180 --> 02:05.263
Oh, this is the best.

02:05.265 --> 02:07.098
You have booze
with breakfast on a Tuesday,

02:07.100 --> 02:08.149
you got a problem.

02:08.151 --> 02:10.651
You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.

02:10.654 --> 02:12.570
Sheldon doesn't believe
in brunch.

02:12.572 --> 02:14.055
He can't stand being at a table

02:14.057 --> 02:15.323
where one person's
having an omelet

02:15.325 --> 02:17.609
and another person's
having a sandwich.

02:17.611 --> 02:20.945
He's not exhausting at all.

02:22.532 --> 02:24.032
Oh.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.400
It's Leonard.

02:25.402 --> 02:27.702
he says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield

02:27.704 --> 02:29.120
at "warp speed."

02:29.122 --> 02:30.905
Maybe it's the mimosa,

02:30.907 --> 02:33.341
but I'm gonna give
the kid an LOL.

02:35.044 --> 02:36.344
It's cute how excited they are.

02:36.346 --> 02:37.545
You should have seen Howard

02:37.547 --> 02:39.347
sewing his costume all week
for the convention.

02:39.349 --> 02:41.299
When did Howard learn
to sew?

02:41.301 --> 02:42.934
When he was a little boy,
every couple months,

02:42.936 --> 02:44.853
he would have to let
his mom's pants out.

02:48.441 --> 02:51.226
I don't even understand why
they go to these conventions.

02:51.228 --> 02:53.478
I know. The four of them work
at a major university.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.479
They're all super smart.

02:54.481 --> 02:55.730
How can they still be
into something

02:55.732 --> 02:57.232
made for 12-year-olds?

02:57.234 --> 02:58.566
I don't mind it.

02:58.568 --> 03:00.852
I think Howie's just in touch
with his inner child.

03:00.854 --> 03:02.987
Although when he comes to bed
in his Batman pajamas,

03:02.989 --> 03:06.825
sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.

03:08.627 --> 03:10.912
It's probably because
they were bullied growing up.

03:10.914 --> 03:12.664
In a world
where you can't fight back,

03:12.666 --> 03:15.216
superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.

03:16.386 --> 03:18.553
Now I feel bad for picking
on all those kids.

03:18.555 --> 03:20.004
Although, in my defense,

03:20.006 --> 03:22.390
if Danny Biffle didn't want
to eat a mouthful of dirt,

03:22.392 --> 03:26.311
he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.

03:26.313 --> 03:28.680
I've never even read
a comic book. You guys?

03:28.682 --> 03:29.814
Uh-uh.
No.

03:29.816 --> 03:30.849
I mean, it's such an important

03:30.851 --> 03:31.816
part of their lives.

03:31.818 --> 03:33.401
Maybe we should try
reading some.

03:33.403 --> 03:35.820
Seriously?

03:35.822 --> 03:38.239
The comic book store
isn't far from here.

03:38.241 --> 03:40.608
That is an amazing idea.

03:40.610 --> 03:43.912
Okay, how many of these
have I had?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.618
I think you should turn
on the GPS.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.253
It is on.

03:52.255 --> 03:55.507
But the turn-by-turn
voice option isn't on.

03:55.509 --> 03:56.791
I know I'd feel more safe

03:56.793 --> 03:58.710
if you turn on the turn-by-turn
voice option.

03:58.712 --> 04:01.262
I love the turn-by-turn
voice option.

04:01.264 --> 04:05.500
Has it really only
been ten miles?

04:05.502 --> 04:08.136
I'm turning it on,
but just to shut you up.

04:09.671 --> 04:13.024
Leonard, bear left and continue

04:13.026 --> 04:15.310
on Interstate 210.

04:16.946 --> 04:19.363
Ooh, sounds like that fellow
knows what he's talking about.

04:19.366 --> 04:23.234
I'd put on my listening ears
if I were you.

04:23.236 --> 04:24.852
What did you do?

04:24.854 --> 04:26.738
I found a hack online.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.573
I was able to upload
MP3 recordings

04:28.575 --> 04:30.825
of my voice to your GPS.

04:30.827 --> 04:31.910
That is so cool.

04:31.912 --> 04:33.912
Counterpoint,
no, it's not.

04:33.914 --> 04:36.581
Continue on Interstate 210

04:36.583 --> 04:38.082
for five miles.

04:38.084 --> 04:42.754
Here's an interesting fact
about interstates.

04:42.756 --> 04:44.756
Really?

04:44.758 --> 04:47.258
Shh,
he said it's interesting.

04:47.260 --> 04:50.728
Interstates are numbered
as follows.

04:50.730 --> 04:53.765
Even-numbered routes
run east and west,

04:53.767 --> 04:56.267
odd-numbered routes

04:56.269 --> 04:58.269
run north and south.

04:59.855 --> 05:02.390
Three-digit route numbers
indicate bypasses

05:02.392 --> 05:05.527
or spurs.

05:05.529 --> 05:08.413
Look, Leonard,
there's a bridge.

05:08.415 --> 05:09.747
Drive off it.

05:09.749 --> 05:13.618
You know, we're not that far
from Vazquez Rocks.

05:13.620 --> 05:16.955
Oh, they shot a lot
of <i>Star Trek</i> episodes out there.

05:16.957 --> 05:19.123
We've got our costumes
in the trunk.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.709
We could go there
and have a little photo shoot.

05:21.711 --> 05:23.094
Great idea.

05:23.096 --> 05:25.463
I haven't had a carbohydrate
in two weeks.

05:25.465 --> 05:27.715
These cheekbones need
to be in front of a camera

05:27.717 --> 05:29.884
before I eat a pretzel
and they're gone.

05:30.686 --> 05:31.970
Yeah, that sounds fun.

05:31.972 --> 05:33.221
Oh, smashing.

05:33.223 --> 05:35.923
Now, Leonard,
do you know how to get there?

05:35.925 --> 05:36.523
No.

05:36.548 --> 05:38.727
Yeah, well luckily,
someone in the car does.

05:38.728 --> 05:40.528
Recalculating.

05:40.530 --> 05:43.531
While we're waiting,

05:43.533 --> 05:46.067
do you know
which president signed

05:46.069 --> 05:49.270
the Intestate Highway System Act
into law?

05:49.272 --> 05:53.107
The answer,
coming up in 14 miles.

05:53.109 --> 05:55.994
None of you will get it.

05:55.996 --> 05:58.162
It's Eisenhower.

06:00.000 --> 06:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:11.260 --> 06:13.177
Why are they staring?

06:13.179 --> 06:15.513
Who cares?

06:15.515 --> 06:18.182
Just soak it in.

06:18.184 --> 06:20.401
Hello, boys.

06:22.104 --> 06:25.240
Oh, hey.

06:26.926 --> 06:28.676
Could you please stop staring?
They're just girls.

06:28.678 --> 06:32.413
It's nothing you haven't seen
in movies or in drawings.

06:34.116 --> 06:35.700
Hey, Stuart.

06:35.702 --> 06:36.701
Wh-What brings you guys here?

06:36.703 --> 06:38.152
We were looking
for a recommendation

06:38.154 --> 06:39.504
about comic books.

06:39.506 --> 06:40.722
Oh, well, I recommend

06:40.724 --> 06:42.957
you don't open a store
and sell them.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.275
No, we were just wondering

06:44.277 --> 06:45.927
why the guys like
this stuff so much,

06:45.929 --> 06:47.629
so we thought we'd
give it a try.

06:47.631 --> 06:49.714
Oh, okay. What do you think
you might be into?

06:49.716 --> 06:51.266
Superhero, fantasy,
graphic novels, manga--

06:51.268 --> 06:55.670
I swear
I will turn a hose on you.

06:59.475 --> 07:01.943
What kind of comics
do the guys like?

07:01.945 --> 07:03.578
Um, a litt bit of everything.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.396
Mostly superhero stuff.

07:05.398 --> 07:07.315
All right, well,
who's the best superhero?

07:07.317 --> 07:08.499
Shh!

07:08.501 --> 07:10.451
You can't ask a question
like that in here.

07:10.453 --> 07:13.121
Are you trying
to start a rumble?

07:13.123 --> 07:15.990
Well, what do you recommend?

07:15.992 --> 07:17.358
Well, uh, let's see.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.294
You've got your basic
clean-cut good guys--

07:19.296 --> 07:21.079
Superman, Spider-Man,
Captain America.

07:21.081 --> 07:23.982
Then you have
your darker anti-heroes--

07:23.984 --> 07:26.617
your Batman, your Wolverine,
Punisher.

07:26.619 --> 07:30.088
Ooh, I do love a bad boy.

07:30.090 --> 07:33.975
As evidenced by your boyfriend
and his fear of hamsters.

07:35.344 --> 07:38.763
If I were you,
I'd go for <i>Fables</i> number one.

07:38.765 --> 07:40.214
The artwork
is sophisticated,

07:40.216 --> 07:41.399
it's intelligently written,

07:41.401 --> 07:43.401
and it doesn't objectify
or stereotype women.

07:43.403 --> 07:44.602
Ooh, Thor!

07:44.604 --> 07:47.238
He's hot.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.824
Yeah, he kind of is.

07:54.396 --> 07:56.497
And we're blending,

07:56.499 --> 07:58.366
and we're blending,

07:58.368 --> 08:00.251
and we're done.

08:02.955 --> 08:06.457
I know Mr. Data
isn't supposed to smile,

08:06.459 --> 08:09.043
but here it comes.

08:11.630 --> 08:13.715
Come on, guys.

08:13.717 --> 08:15.299
Let's do this.

08:15.301 --> 08:18.603
Yeah, I'm sweating
my bald cap off.

08:22.107 --> 08:24.559
So what's our first
pose going to be?

08:24.561 --> 08:27.395
I say we begin with a classic
<i>Star Trek</i> fight scene.

08:27.397 --> 08:29.313
I'll set the timer.

08:34.953 --> 08:36.703
Sheldon,
how is that a fight pose?

08:36.706 --> 08:39.741
Mr. Data's weapon is his mind.

08:39.743 --> 08:41.376
I'm wielding it.

08:49.102 --> 08:51.452
Phasers on the Borg!

08:53.940 --> 08:55.723
<i>Charlie's Angels.</i>

08:59.863 --> 09:00.762
Okay, what's next?

09:00.764 --> 09:01.929
Now let's do

09:01.931 --> 09:03.464
some sexy glamour shots.

09:03.466 --> 09:04.632
I'll set the mood.

09:04.634 --> 09:06.851
Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

09:06.853 --> 09:10.521
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz,
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz...

09:10.523 --> 09:13.408
oontz, oontz, oontz,
oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz.

09:13.410 --> 09:15.576
Yeah, nice one.

09:15.578 --> 09:17.161
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

09:17.163 --> 09:18.863
That's right.

09:18.865 --> 09:19.864
Oontz, oontz, oontz.

09:21.084 --> 09:22.450
Oh, my God.

09:22.452 --> 09:24.285
Leonard,
someone's stealing your car!

09:24.287 --> 09:26.487
What? Hey, hey!

09:26.489 --> 09:28.122
Come back here!
Stop!

09:28.124 --> 09:31.492
Stealing is against the law!

09:31.494 --> 09:34.545
I don't believe this.

09:34.547 --> 09:36.180
Son of a bitch.

09:36.182 --> 09:37.832
I'll call 911.

09:37.834 --> 09:38.933
Wha...

09:38.935 --> 09:41.135
Oh, no, my phone is
in my other pants.

09:41.137 --> 09:42.887
Oh, so is mine.
Mine, too.

09:42.889 --> 09:44.472
Anybody got any ideas?

09:44.474 --> 09:45.890
Nope.

09:45.892 --> 09:48.559
The only thing left to
do now is assign blame.

09:48.561 --> 09:50.728
Nice going.

09:59.906 --> 10:02.274
What kind of a person steals
another person's car

10:02.276 --> 10:03.742
in broad daylight?

10:03.744 --> 10:06.328
What kind of person
leaves his keys in the car?

10:06.330 --> 10:08.630
I thought we agreed this was
all Koothrappali's fault.

10:08.632 --> 10:09.882
You're right.

10:09.884 --> 10:12.301
Nice going.

10:12.303 --> 10:14.119
Car.

10:21.394 --> 10:22.544
What is wrong with people?

10:22.546 --> 10:23.679
Why don't they stop?

10:23.681 --> 10:25.147
Maybe we're better off.

10:25.149 --> 10:27.933
What if we were to get in a car
with a crazy person?

10:27.935 --> 10:29.601
Look at us, Sheldon.

10:29.603 --> 10:31.153
We're the crazy people.

10:33.907 --> 10:36.441
Well, perhaps we should
hold up a sign

10:36.443 --> 10:40.662
that assures passing motorists
of our mental competence.

10:40.664 --> 10:42.614
Good idea.

10:42.616 --> 10:44.917
Why don't you
get started on that?

10:45.752 --> 10:47.986
Come on,
let's just start walking.

10:47.988 --> 10:50.372
There's got to be a gas station
or something nearby.

10:50.374 --> 10:52.040
What, you think just
because you're wearing

10:52.042 --> 10:54.343
a captain's uniform,
you're in charge?

10:54.345 --> 10:56.428
Yes.

10:56.430 --> 10:58.413
All right.

11:08.441 --> 11:11.393
Hmm, okay, I'm done.

11:11.395 --> 11:13.362
How did you guys
finish so fast?

11:13.364 --> 11:15.447
I don't know,
there were a lot of pictures,

11:15.449 --> 11:19.568
and one page only had
the word "brakkadoom!"

11:19.570 --> 11:24.039
Yeah, well,
I have street smarts.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.058
So, what'd you guys think?

11:26.060 --> 11:29.211
Well, there was a lot of action,
Mmm.

11:29.213 --> 11:31.496
and the story moved along
at a brisk pace.

11:31.498 --> 11:33.415
It was, overall...

11:33.417 --> 11:35.533
what's the word I'm looking for?

11:35.535 --> 11:37.169
Stupid?
So stupid.

11:38.104 --> 11:39.304
I don't know how
Leonard can get

11:39.306 --> 11:40.422
so caught up in this.

11:40.424 --> 11:41.723
It's crazy; they spend hours

11:41.725 --> 11:43.875
arguing about things
that don't even exist.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.510
What a waste of time.
I know.

11:45.512 --> 11:48.080
A hammer so heavy that no
one else can pick it up?

11:49.934 --> 11:51.733
I don't think it's heavy.

11:51.735 --> 11:54.937
It's some sort of magic,
so only Thor can lift it.

11:54.939 --> 11:57.072
That makes even less
sense, I mean...

11:57.074 --> 12:01.660
No, no, no, it doesn't.

12:01.662 --> 12:02.811
Thor is a god.

12:02.813 --> 12:04.913
The hammer is his;
only he can use it.

12:04.915 --> 12:08.083
It's like Sheldon
and his toothbrush.

12:09.035 --> 12:11.753
Or his thin, beckoning lips.

12:13.072 --> 12:15.540
Okay, hang on, what if
Thor's hand is on the hammer?

12:15.542 --> 12:17.709
I mean, if he's touching it
with his god magic,

12:17.711 --> 12:19.244
does that mean I could lift it?

12:19.246 --> 12:21.964
No.
Yes.

12:21.966 --> 12:24.032
Well, which is it?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.435
Maybe we missed something.

12:26.437 --> 12:27.552
Let's read it again.

12:27.554 --> 12:29.821
Okay.
Yeah.

12:34.061 --> 12:36.528
You want some tea?

12:36.530 --> 12:37.529
Good idea.

12:37.531 --> 12:39.481
I'll help you.

12:39.483 --> 12:41.316
Wait, I thought we were reading.

12:41.318 --> 12:42.618
We are.

12:42.620 --> 12:46.455
We're just, uh,
giving you a head start.

12:55.164 --> 12:57.633
I wish my mom was here.

12:57.635 --> 13:01.953
We could all hang out
in her shadow.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.139
Wool pants in the desert.

13:04.141 --> 13:07.476
I feel like I've got
poached testicles.

13:09.395 --> 13:10.646
Oh, you poor thing;

13:10.648 --> 13:12.114
you're sweating.

13:12.116 --> 13:14.933
That's so much worse than
having your car stolen.

13:14.935 --> 13:17.002
Insurance is gonna buy you
a new car.

13:17.004 --> 13:20.238
It's not gonna
de-funk my junk.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.407
Gentlemen,

13:22.409 --> 13:24.192
a little less bellyaching.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.610
We're Starfleet officers

13:25.612 --> 13:27.746
and a member
of the Borg Collective.

13:27.748 --> 13:30.699
Please, Sheldon,
I am so not in the mood.

13:30.701 --> 13:34.319
Leonard,
all our lives we have dreamed

13:34.321 --> 13:35.587
of finding ourselves

13:35.589 --> 13:38.423
inside one of
the fantasy worlds we love.

13:38.425 --> 13:40.509
And look at us.

13:40.511 --> 13:42.260
At this moment, we are, in fact,

13:42.262 --> 13:44.429
a <i>Star Trek</i> landing party

13:44.431 --> 13:48.066
stranded in an alien
and unforgiving environment,

13:48.068 --> 13:50.936
relying only on our wits,
our fortitude

13:50.938 --> 13:52.604
and our moxie.

13:52.606 --> 13:55.006
As long as we have
those things,

13:55.008 --> 13:57.342
- nothing can stop...
- Nerds!

14:03.066 --> 14:05.233
I hate this planet.

14:10.907 --> 14:12.657
It says right here
on the hammer,

14:12.659 --> 14:15.293
"Whoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

14:15.295 --> 14:17.079
shall possess
the power of Thor."

14:17.081 --> 14:18.797
Hold on,
who decides who's worthy?

14:18.799 --> 14:20.165
Does the hammer decide?

14:20.167 --> 14:21.500
Yes!
No!

14:23.252 --> 14:24.669
It can't decide.

14:24.671 --> 14:25.971
It's a hammer.

14:25.973 --> 14:27.539
You said it's a magic hammer.

14:27.541 --> 14:29.424
Yeah, it can't make decisions.

14:29.426 --> 14:31.009
If Harry Potter's wand
can make decisions,

14:31.011 --> 14:32.644
why can't Thor's hammer?

14:32.646 --> 14:35.347
Okay, if you're going to start
comparing wands and hammers,

14:35.349 --> 14:38.934
I can't even take you seriously.

14:56.085 --> 14:58.370
Hello.

14:58.372 --> 15:00.789
Hello.

15:01.707 --> 15:05.127
Uh, four glasses
of water, please.

15:05.129 --> 15:08.013
Anything for you guys?

15:08.015 --> 15:10.515
Can I use your phone?

15:10.517 --> 15:11.800
Our car got stolen.

15:11.802 --> 15:14.553
Why don't you ask Scotty
to beam you up?

15:16.557 --> 15:19.775
Scotty was on the
original series,

15:19.777 --> 15:22.477
and we're <i>Next Generation.</i>

15:22.479 --> 15:26.364
So... joke's on you.

15:29.435 --> 15:32.154
We're not with him.

15:35.892 --> 15:38.210
You can't pick something up
in outer space.

15:38.212 --> 15:40.579
In space, there is no up.

15:40.581 --> 15:44.115
Oh, yeah? Then how does
the sun come "up" every day?

15:45.401 --> 15:48.453
Hard to argue with those kind
of street smarts.

15:53.342 --> 15:55.560
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes
of comics across the hall.

15:55.562 --> 15:56.845
Why don't we go look at those?

15:56.847 --> 15:58.680
Oh, great! Yes!
And then you will see.

15:58.682 --> 16:01.233
I am not wrong, because
if we were in outer space,

16:01.235 --> 16:03.018
then anyone
could pick up the hammer

16:03.020 --> 16:04.452
because it would be
floating around

16:04.454 --> 16:05.737
in a weightless environment.

16:05.739 --> 16:07.972
Yeah, that's right, the
slow reader used science.

16:07.974 --> 16:09.391
Suck on that.

16:12.111 --> 16:14.246
Was there anything
valuable in the car?

16:14.248 --> 16:17.115
Our clothes,
our wallets, phones.

16:17.117 --> 16:18.750
And about $300 worth of makeup,

16:18.752 --> 16:22.070
so this thief could look like
anyone right now.

16:22.072 --> 16:24.256
Makeup?

16:24.258 --> 16:26.491
Sure.

16:27.877 --> 16:30.929
Uh, we're going to the Comic-Con
in Bakersfield.

16:30.931 --> 16:32.997
They have a big costume contest.

16:33.666 --> 16:36.268
It's cooler than it sounds.

16:36.270 --> 16:40.272
I don't know,
sounds pretty cool.

16:40.274 --> 16:42.107
I-It is.

16:42.109 --> 16:43.308
It's not just comic books.

16:43.310 --> 16:44.893
They've got
action figures, toys,

16:44.895 --> 16:46.611
a Tron-themed dance party...

16:46.613 --> 16:48.230
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

16:49.282 --> 16:51.149
I think I have all I need here.

16:51.151 --> 16:52.850
You guys need me
to call someone?

16:52.852 --> 16:55.853
I'm guessing your moms?

16:57.006 --> 16:59.641
Thanks,
but we've got it covered.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.860
Okay,
I just talked to my mom.

17:05.915 --> 17:08.199
She arranged for us
to get a rental car.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.367
Great.

17:09.368 --> 17:11.002
We can still make it
to Comic-Con.

17:11.003 --> 17:12.304
Are you kidding me?

17:12.306 --> 17:14.506
After all we've been through,
I just want to go home.

17:14.508 --> 17:15.873
Don't be like that.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.224
Come on, Howard,
talk to him.

17:17.227 --> 17:18.727
I'm with Leonard.

17:18.729 --> 17:20.712
I'm done.

17:20.714 --> 17:23.397
Fine, then I guess
it's two against two.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.766
How do we decide?

17:24.768 --> 17:28.687
Actually,
it's three against one.

17:28.689 --> 17:30.054
What?!

17:30.056 --> 17:31.189
What about the mission?

17:31.191 --> 17:32.991
You said we were
a real-life landing party.

17:32.993 --> 17:34.809
Yeah, well, we're not.

17:34.811 --> 17:36.528
We're an imaginary landing party

17:36.530 --> 17:39.080
who had real-life garbage
thrown at us

17:39.082 --> 17:41.833
by real-life strangers
who think we're idiots.

17:43.035 --> 17:44.369
And to tell you the truth,

17:44.371 --> 17:46.671
I'm starting to feel like one.

17:46.673 --> 17:49.240
I want to go home now.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.543
Okay.

17:51.545 --> 17:55.297
Did we at least rent the car
from Enterprise?

17:58.384 --> 18:00.352
Get it? Enterprise?

18:01.587 --> 18:04.255
Screw you. That's funny.

18:06.859 --> 18:08.810
Well, what if the
Hulk picked up Thor

18:08.812 --> 18:10.762
while Thor is
holding the hammer?

18:10.764 --> 18:12.063
Yeah?

18:12.065 --> 18:13.264
Then by the transitive property

18:13.266 --> 18:16.401
of picking things up,
Hulk picked up the hammer.

18:17.453 --> 18:18.570
No.

18:18.572 --> 18:20.572
Hulk picked up Thor,
Thor picked up the hammer.

18:20.574 --> 18:21.656
Okay, hang on.

18:21.658 --> 18:23.625
If I go to a bar
and pick up a guy,

18:23.627 --> 18:25.744
and he picks up a girl,
and then we all leave together,

18:25.746 --> 18:27.779
did I pick up the girl?

18:31.367 --> 18:34.619
Did that ever happen?

18:34.621 --> 18:38.340
Hey, are we talking about me
or are we talking about Thor?

18:45.231 --> 18:49.067
Well, I say that's the last time
we ever go outside.

18:49.069 --> 18:50.352
Look, right here.

18:50.354 --> 18:52.237
Red Hulk is picking
up Thor's hammer

18:52.239 --> 18:53.688
'cause Thor's touching it.

18:53.690 --> 18:56.157
No, it's because
they're in space.

18:56.159 --> 18:57.642
He's really
just touching the strap.

18:57.644 --> 18:59.811
The strap is part
of the hammer!

18:59.813 --> 19:01.746
No, it's not!

19:01.748 --> 19:04.816
Are they actually arguing
about comic books?

19:04.818 --> 19:06.334
No, that can't be right.

19:06.336 --> 19:08.203
Maybe "Thor's Hammer"

19:08.205 --> 19:12.090
is a new color of nail polish.

19:12.092 --> 19:13.758
Then Red Hulk must be worthy.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.760
How could
Red Hulk be worthy?

19:15.762 --> 19:18.046
You don't know his life!

19:21.300 --> 19:24.502
There's only one
logical explanation.

19:24.504 --> 19:26.638
Somewhere in the desert
we crossed

19:26.640 --> 19:28.973
into an alternate dimension...

19:28.975 --> 19:30.341
where the women in our lives

19:30.343 --> 19:33.311
can finally appreciate
great literature.

19:34.513 --> 19:36.881
If it's an
alternate dimension...

19:36.883 --> 19:40.285
sounds like a job
for a landing party.

19:44.623 --> 19:46.958
Captain,
what are your orders?

19:46.960 --> 19:49.794
I say we investigate.

19:53.532 --> 19:54.916
Wait.

19:56.919 --> 19:59.087
They might be hostile.

20:01.424 --> 20:03.040
Fine, but set them to stun.

20:03.042 --> 20:04.375
If we vaporize Penny,

20:04.377 --> 20:06.344
I'll never find a girlfriend
that pretty again.

20:18.893 --> 20:20.393
<i>Fun fact:</i>

20:20.395 --> 20:24.880
President Eisenhower signed
the Federal Aid Highway Act

20:24.882 --> 20:27.483
from his hospital room.

20:27.578 --> 20:30.629
Wow, that is interesting.

20:31.715 --> 20:35.083
You learn something new
every day.

20:35.085 --> 20:37.502
Say, can you
name the four state capitols

20:37.504 --> 20:40.388
that are not served
by the interstate system?

20:40.390 --> 20:44.042
Ooh, another quiz.
Yes!
