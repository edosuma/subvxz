WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.222
("It's Beginning to Look a Lot
like Christmas" playing)

00:21.255 --> 00:23.191
Thank you.

00:25.726 --> 00:29.163
* It's beginning to look a lot
like Christmas *

00:29.197 --> 00:30.931
I don't get it.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.933
Every year. People flock

00:32.966 --> 00:35.236
to his house and take pictures.
Never our house.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.572
It's not fair.
I worked just as hard as he did.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.108
What does he have that I don't?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.575
OLIVIA:
Oh, I don't know, taste?

00:41.609 --> 00:44.078
JOHN: He's bribing them with
free food. Go make some cookies.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.914
Let it go, John. Christmas isn't
about competition.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.449
Just be grateful
for what we have.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.185
No. I have a better idea.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.622
* But the prettiest sight
to see *

00:54.655 --> 00:56.224
* Is the holly that will be

00:56.257 --> 00:59.927
* On your own front door

00:59.960 --> 01:02.763
We got hot chocolate,
hot cider and everything.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.897
(indistinct chatter)

01:03.931 --> 01:05.599
You want to see something good?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.201
-Get a load of this.
-MAN: Look!

01:07.235 --> 01:08.702
He's up on the roof.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.871
* It's beginning to look...

01:10.904 --> 01:12.440
Uh-huh.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.874
You looking? You looking?

01:13.907 --> 01:18.612
-* Soon the bells will start
-(exhales)

01:18.646 --> 01:20.114
* And the thing
that will make them ring *

01:20.148 --> 01:22.483
* Is the carol that you sing

01:22.516 --> 01:25.153
* Right within your heart

01:25.186 --> 01:27.455
(screams)

01:27.488 --> 01:30.924
* It's beginning to look a lot
like Christmas. *

01:35.596 --> 01:38.299
It's this way.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.301
(groaning)

01:40.334 --> 01:42.736
Sir, can you move at all?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.805
-It hurts.
-Okay. Probably a good sign.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.407
Just stay still. Can you tell me
how this happened?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.075
Snowman pushed me off the roof.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.411
(groans)

01:50.444 --> 01:52.680
Blood pressure's 120/70.
Respiration's good.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.316
-All right. Yeah.
-Do we move him over
a little bit?

01:55.349 --> 01:57.651
Doesn't appear to be
any spinal damage.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.288
All right,
let's get him on a backboard.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.956
(whimpers, grunts)

02:02.990 --> 02:04.625
Oh, looks like the baby Jesus
broke your fall.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.527
-That's a Christmas miracle.
-BOBBY: You guys ready?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.695
-CHIMNEY: Yeah.
-(camera clicks)

02:07.728 --> 02:10.298
-(indistinct chatter)
-(camera clicks)

02:10.331 --> 02:12.666
Oh, look, John,
you finally got your wish.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.135
Everyone's taking pictures.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.137
-(cameras clicking)
-Ready to go.

02:17.171 --> 02:20.174
This is the best Christmas ever.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.276
Ready? One, two...

02:22.310 --> 02:24.212
(bells jingle)

02:30.318 --> 02:32.286
(Athena laughs)

02:32.320 --> 02:35.823
That knot is the same size
it was ten minutes ago.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.124
Yeah, I'm beginning to think
it's something mankind

02:37.157 --> 02:38.626
wasn't meant to tamper with.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.960
Well, maybe you'll have
better luck

02:39.993 --> 02:43.897
with your next project.
(chuckles)

02:43.931 --> 02:47.901
Oh, Harry saw a YouTube review.
He has been talking

02:47.935 --> 02:50.137
about nothing else
for three months.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.072
Been hiding it in the garage.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.343
When we were kids,
we got excited about lawn darts.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.910
-Lawn darts?
-Yeah, you know,

02:56.944 --> 02:58.346
those metal spikes
with the wings on them

02:58.379 --> 03:00.214
you'd toss across your lawn.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.015
-(chuckles)
-I think they stopped
making them

03:02.049 --> 03:04.418
because there were so many
injuries, but I loved them.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.420
My brother was a madman.
He'd throw them

03:06.454 --> 03:08.356
way up in the air,
then he'd laugh at me

03:08.389 --> 03:09.690
while I freaked out,
running around,

03:09.723 --> 03:11.225
not knowing where
they were gonna come down.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.993
I think this is
a minimum two-hour assembly.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.395
It's getting pretty late, so...

03:14.428 --> 03:16.864
Maybe you could just sleep over.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.832
We can make a night of it.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.269
Hot chocolate,
a little Nat King Cole.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.836
Well, I like the sound of that.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.105
-Know what would be even better?
-Hmm?

03:25.138 --> 03:27.007
If you didn't have
to sleep over at all

03:27.040 --> 03:29.443
'cause you already lived here.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.045
(chuckles)

03:32.079 --> 03:33.981
Wow.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.721
(laughs) You look
like you praying for a 911 call.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.590
Oh, no, I'm not. I...

03:42.623 --> 03:45.025
Well, maybe a little one.
Cat in a tree.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.194
-(both chuckle)
-I just, you know,

03:47.227 --> 03:50.531
I get tired of having to say
good night to you at the door

03:50.564 --> 03:53.867
and tired of sleeping alone
in a bed made for two.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.403
I want you in my life.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.738
I know the idea
of another family--

03:57.771 --> 04:00.107
instant family--

04:00.140 --> 04:03.911
probably rings a lot of bells
for you after what happened.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.614
No, 'Thena, it's not that.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.249
You just...
you just took me by surprise.

04:11.352 --> 04:15.889
Look, I'm not trying
to give you an ultimatum.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.391
I mean, move in or else.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.092
That's not me. That's not it.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.461
I just wanted you to know

04:20.494 --> 04:23.130
that I was open
to taking the next step.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.970
*

04:32.973 --> 04:36.076
* Hey, take a picture

04:36.109 --> 04:39.447
* Show me
what's the news today *

04:39.480 --> 04:43.317
* It's an addiction

04:43.351 --> 04:46.320
* It's a game
I badly want to play *

04:46.354 --> 04:49.657
* So raise the stakes, boy

04:49.690 --> 04:51.492
* And show me what...

04:51.525 --> 04:52.626
(music stops)

04:52.660 --> 04:54.795
(grunts)
Morning, roomie.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.864
Yeah, about that...

04:56.897 --> 04:58.799
(panting)

04:58.832 --> 04:59.867
(knock on door)

04:59.900 --> 05:01.602
BUCK:
Hey.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.337
Looks like you're stuck
with me again.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.938
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.741
I have a new air mattress
waiting for you.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.546
You saw this coming?

05:12.580 --> 05:14.081
You didn't?

05:23.156 --> 05:26.494
(both laugh)

05:26.527 --> 05:28.829
Oh, we suck at this.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.031
Really?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.833
'Cause I feel pretty good
about how that went down.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.636
(laughs):
You know what I mean.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.172
We say we're gonna talk
and work things out,

05:39.206 --> 05:42.510
but we just keep ending up
like this.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.078
It's a different way
of working things out.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.381
SHANNON (chuckles):
Mm-hmm.

05:47.415 --> 05:50.217
-You're getting the tree today?
-Mm-hmm.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.252
The annual tradition
of convincing him

05:52.285 --> 05:56.256
that, no, a 16-foot tree
does not fit in the house.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.762
You know, I caved one year.

06:01.795 --> 06:05.198
-(laughs)
-That last Christmas
before you got back.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.735
He hadn't been feeling well,
and...

06:07.768 --> 06:09.870
we missed you.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.441
When Christopher looked up
at that giant tree,

06:13.474 --> 06:16.376
I couldn't say no.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.912
(laughs)
Where'd you put it?

06:18.946 --> 06:22.349
-The backyard. (laughs)
-Oh, yeah.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.917
Of course.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.119
But we didn't have
enough ornaments to cover it,

06:26.153 --> 06:29.389
so we just loaded it up
with lights and ribbon.

06:29.423 --> 06:32.025
And I got the sleeping bags out,
and we laid under it,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.595
just staring up at the branches
for hours.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.797
Mm.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.232
-He must have loved that.
-Yeah.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.601
(both chuckle)

06:44.271 --> 06:47.140
(Eddie sighs)

06:47.174 --> 06:49.977
You know, he still won't tell me
what he wants for Christmas.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.113
-I've tried everything.
-Did you take him to see Santa?

06:53.146 --> 06:56.049
You mean the creepy guy at
the mall with a fake beard? No.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.719
(laughs) Oh, my God.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.387
You still haven't let that go.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.823
Look, just because
you got scared

07:02.856 --> 07:06.594
and threw up all over Santa,
that doesn't mean...

07:06.627 --> 07:08.228
First off, yeah,
that was very wrong

07:08.261 --> 07:10.130
of my abuela
to tell you that story.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.465
And-and second, no.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.600
I wasn't scared. I...

07:12.633 --> 07:15.569
The old guy smelled bad,
and I had a stomach flu.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.606
Really? Two years in a row

07:18.639 --> 07:20.574
-you had the stomach flu? Yeah?
-Yeah.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.242
(door opens)

07:22.275 --> 07:23.611
-CHRISTOPHER: Daddy!
-ISABEL: Eddito?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.145
Are you here?

07:27.347 --> 07:28.982
Why is he here? I thought
you were picking him up.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.251
I'll distract them.
You-you head out the back.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.753
-Whoa, w-wait.
-What?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.455
-What?
-You want me to sneak out?

07:35.489 --> 07:37.525
(knocking)

07:37.558 --> 07:39.259
That's our son out there.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.328
Look, we've been trying
to figure out

07:41.361 --> 07:43.497
-how to tell him.
Maybe this is the moment.
-Daddy. Daddy.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.798
-Dad?
-It's not the moment, okay?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.167
You-you have to go.
You have to go.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.836
-Hey. Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.804
Thought I was supposed
to pick you up at Abuela's.

07:50.838 --> 07:54.107
ISABEL: Oh, he was so excited
about decorating

07:54.141 --> 07:56.276
that he couldn't wait
to get home.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.012
Did you have company?

07:59.046 --> 08:01.048
What?

08:01.081 --> 08:03.717
Oh, you know,
I'm not the best housekeeper.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.486
Show...
Hey, show me what you got.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.522
ISABEL: We ended up
with two Christmas trees.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.725
-He said,
"This is Daddy, this is me."
-Yeah?

08:11.759 --> 08:14.361
-(chuckles): Aw.
-Huh?

08:14.394 --> 08:17.130
You loved this green one,
didn't you?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.332
-Let's get this out of the way.
-Okay.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.234
Let me help you out, buddy.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.204
("Wonderful Christmastime"
by Paul McCartney playing)

08:35.015 --> 08:40.520
-* Simply having
a wonderful Christmastime *
-(alarm blaring)

08:40.554 --> 08:45.759
* Simply having
a wonderful Christmastime *

08:45.793 --> 08:50.564
* The choir of children
sing their song *

08:50.598 --> 08:52.232
(indistinct chatter)

08:55.368 --> 08:57.838
* Ding-dong

08:57.871 --> 09:00.908
* Ding-dong,
ding-dong, ding... *

09:14.622 --> 09:16.590
-I beg your pardon?
-I can't breathe.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.725
-I can't breathe.
-Uh...

09:17.758 --> 09:19.259
Sir, where are you calling from?

09:19.292 --> 09:21.094
I'm trapped
inside a Christmas present.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.264
-You're what, now?
-I work at West L.A. Distro
on Sepulveda.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.601
I was pulling a double shift
in the warehouse, and...

09:27.635 --> 09:30.738
Ow. Oh, I'm bleeding.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.372
Something must have hit me
on the head.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.041
I must have passed out
in one of these boxes,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.542
and it got loaded somehow.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.910
-I think I'm on a truck.
-Okay.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.545
The West L.A. Distro
on Sepulveda.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.947
Tell me your name.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.214
-Brandon Skinner.
-Okay, Brandon.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.750
You're sealed in a box,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.417
and you think you're on a truck.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.286
Yeah. I'm getting jostled
pretty good in here.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.055
-Is it a cardboard box?
-Yeah.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.390
Can you punch
or kick your way out of it?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.959
Tried. I tried!

09:51.992 --> 09:53.226
I've been shrink-wrapped.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.427
I'm getting
a little claustrophobic.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.129
Brandon, my name is Maddie.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.965
Listen to my voice,
and just breathe.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.133
I can't. I can't.
There's no air.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.434
-Oh, God!
-Brandon, there's air.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.803
You're talking to me,
so there's air.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.437
Stay calm. We're gonna find you.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.839
I'll contact the warehouse,

10:05.873 --> 10:07.641
see if we can track down
the truck.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.409
Brandon, do you know how long
you've been in there?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.678
No, I just came to.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.245
It's difficult to breathe.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.147
-I think I'm gonna
pass out again.
-Okay.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.482
I don't want you to talk a lot,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.350
but I need you
to try and stay awake.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.286
We're gonna have you home
for Christmas.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.188
Ha! I hope not.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.323
Not unless this box is going
to Seattle.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.925
-You're from Seattle?
-Yeah.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.426
Going down here for school.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.662
My mom wanted me home
for Christmas break.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.933
She offered to pay for it,
but she can't afford it.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.935
I should probably call her

10:34.968 --> 10:37.104
in case you guys
don't find me in time.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.505
We're gonna find you.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.040
-Just stay with me.
-JOSH: There are trucks

10:40.073 --> 10:41.374
leaving that facility
every 20 minutes.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.609
We're working with the warehouse

10:42.642 --> 10:44.377
to try and contact
all the drivers.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.313
BRANDON:
It stopped. I think we stopped.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.549
Hey! I'm in here! Help!

10:49.582 --> 10:51.518
-(muffled shouting)
-(forklift beeping)

10:53.153 --> 10:55.689
(muffled shouting continues)

11:07.167 --> 11:09.202
-(siren wailing)
-How long's he been in the air?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.538
Plane took off from LAX
18 minutes ago.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.306
It was diverted
to SoCal Airport.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.675
18 minutes. It's nearly
long enough to reach altitude.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.345
It's not good. Cargo isn't
pressurized or heated.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.913
I thought coach was bad.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.514
Hey, Chim, make sure

11:21.548 --> 11:23.416
we have oh-two and
warming blankets standing by.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.552
Copy that.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.055
(sirens wailing)

11:28.088 --> 11:30.690
(fire truck horns honking)

11:40.033 --> 11:42.435
Put your lights on.
Let's go, Chim.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.505
Come on, let's move.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.908
Oh, joy.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.342
Well, it looks like

11:49.376 --> 11:50.744
we're opening presents early
this year, huh?

11:50.778 --> 11:52.712
Clock is ticking, guys.
We got to find this kid.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.547
Dispatch said
he was having trouble breathing

11:54.581 --> 11:56.249
even before
he went up in the air.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.518
-(ringtone playing)
-Wait. Did you guys hear that?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.287
(ringtone continues playing)

12:00.320 --> 12:02.455
Stethoscope?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.592
-(ringtone plays louder)
-That's our guy!

12:05.625 --> 12:07.094
Hey, get this shrink-wrap off.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.295
Got it?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.731
What do we got?

12:11.765 --> 12:13.433
Yeah, I got him.
He's in there. He's in there.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.968
Okay.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.406
(grunting) I see him.
He doesn't look good.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.808
-He out?
-Yeah.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.309
BOBBY:
Okay. Get the bear out.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.743
Get the bear out, guys.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.378
All right, come on.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.713
You ready?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.715
One, two, three.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.650
(ringtone continues playing)

12:35.022 --> 12:37.457
Slide him up.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.060
-He's cold, Cap.
-All right,
get some blankets on him.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.428
EDDIE:
I don't have a pulse.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.497
CHIMNEY:
Starting compressions.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.834
-How's he doing, Eddie?
-Still nothing.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.570
Buck, switch.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.005
All right, switching.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.007
Come on out, Chim.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.244
Hold for a pulse check.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.778
Still nothing.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.485
I got a pulse!

13:05.518 --> 13:08.321
-Temp's rising.
-Welcome back, Brandon.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.824
-I'm not dead?
-BOBBY: You're not dead.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.026
(ringtone playing)

13:14.828 --> 13:17.797
Well, someone really wants
to talk to you.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.867
BRANDON:
She told me not to answer it.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.468
Who did?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.703
Maddie. The 911 lady.

13:23.736 --> 13:26.506
She said she would ring it
for you to find me.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.508
Maddie?

13:28.541 --> 13:31.311
-Chim?
-Oh, fancy meeting you here.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.014
-(laughs) How's Brandon?
-He's good.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.348
He's here.
Do you want to talk to him?

13:35.382 --> 13:37.184
Oh, I do.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.618
Hi, Brandon.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.553
Thank you.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.857
Thank you. (laughs)

13:43.891 --> 13:46.726
-You're welcome.
-I look like an ornament.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.998
Better on the tree
than under it, right?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.870
* Santa Claus
is comin' to town *

13:56.904 --> 13:59.306
* Santa Claus is comin'
to town *

13:59.339 --> 14:01.008
* You better watch out

14:01.041 --> 14:02.475
* You better not cry

14:02.509 --> 14:04.077
* You better not pout

14:04.111 --> 14:06.179
* I'm telling you why

14:06.213 --> 14:09.082
* Santa Claus
is comin' to town... *

14:09.116 --> 14:10.918
Thank you.

14:10.951 --> 14:14.087
Shannon.
What are you doing here?

14:14.121 --> 14:16.990
You won't answer my texts
or return my calls.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.658
-This is not the place.
-Maybe it's the perfect place.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.760
-Thank you.
-We can actually have

14:20.793 --> 14:22.930
a conversation that doesn't
end up with us in bed.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.198
* Gonna find out
who's naughty and nice... *

14:25.232 --> 14:26.666
Follow me.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.235
* Santa Claus is
comin' to town *

14:28.268 --> 14:32.005
* Oh, yeah, Santa Claus
is comin' to town *

14:32.039 --> 14:34.274
* Santa Claus...

14:34.307 --> 14:35.909
I can't do this here, not now.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.245
Then where and when?

14:38.278 --> 14:40.547
It's been almost two months,

14:40.580 --> 14:43.616
and right now, I feel
even further away from him

14:43.650 --> 14:46.886
and from you than I ever did
when we weren't speaking.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.122
Are you ever gonna
let me see Christopher?

14:49.156 --> 14:51.191
Of course.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.193
Eventually.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.195
* You better not cry...

14:55.228 --> 14:57.230
Does he know that I'm here?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.199
I didn't want to confuse him.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.368
Not until I was sure.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.770
Of me?
Because you seemed pretty sure

15:03.803 --> 15:05.772
when we started
having sex again.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.907
Is that how you see this?
Some transaction?

15:07.941 --> 15:11.811
What, you sleep with me
so I let you see Christopher?

15:13.646 --> 15:17.217
I thought
it was a reconciliation.

15:17.250 --> 15:22.089
Right up until the moment
when... you hid me from our son.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.991
I didn't know what else to do!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.093
I didn't know
what else to do.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.827
And I'm not keeping you
from our son

15:27.860 --> 15:29.596
-like some kind of punishment.
-Whatever I need

15:29.629 --> 15:33.100
to do to prove myself
and to fix things, name it.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.235
I am there.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.271
But you and me
and hiding it from him?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.074
That is starting
to make everything feel...

15:41.108 --> 15:43.843
more broken.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.613
You keep looking to me
like I have the answers.

15:46.646 --> 15:50.150
I don't.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.819
No. Just the power.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.256
I'm the one who screwed up,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.325
the one who left.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.694
I know I don't get
to have a say.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.433
So I'm following your lead.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.836
But... where are we going?

16:09.869 --> 16:12.805
When will you be able
to forgive me?

16:12.839 --> 16:15.608
I can forgive you.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.345
I'm just not sure
I can trust you.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.213
(door opens, closes)

16:27.020 --> 16:28.855
Hey, so do you need help
with Christmas dinner?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.357
Oh. No.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.525
-Is-is Bobby working that day?
-I don't know.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.995
I mean... I did a thing
the other night.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.298
It was stupid, foolish--

16:38.331 --> 16:42.235
hell, maybe it was right-- but
either way, it was thoughtless.

16:42.269 --> 16:45.205
Okay. Well, what happened?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.507
I asked Bobby to move in.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.109
Move in here?

16:51.378 --> 16:53.246
So how did he take that?

16:53.280 --> 16:55.014
Kind of like you right now.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.650
L-Listen, I'm just standing here
wrapping these packages.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.752
How do you know
how I'm taking it?

16:59.786 --> 17:02.122
I know that face.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.159
(sighs)

17:06.193 --> 17:08.095
You love him.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.729
You're moving forward.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.231
So am I.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.266
I mean, it's good.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.769
But it ain't easy.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.106
(laughs)

17:19.139 --> 17:22.275
You know, things have been going
so well lately

17:22.309 --> 17:25.945
that, um,
I kind of let myself forget

17:25.978 --> 17:28.948
how complicated all this is.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.184
-Yeah.
-When he's here,

17:31.218 --> 17:32.852
I'm joyful,
when he's not, I'm lonely.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.155
I thought
maybe he felt the same.

17:39.392 --> 17:43.130
Hey. Hey.

17:43.163 --> 17:48.235
Now, Bobby lived a long time
with a secret.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.036
So did I.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.372
Who you are
on the other side of that--

17:52.405 --> 17:55.142
I mean,
it takes time to figure out.

17:55.175 --> 17:58.245
But home isn't a place.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.147
It's a people.

18:00.180 --> 18:05.452
And he loves you,
and he loves our children.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.288
So, if this is meant to be,

18:08.321 --> 18:11.358
he will find his way home.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.265
HEN:
Have a good night, Cap.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.839
Bobby?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.608
You okay?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.443
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.044
Yeah, you have a good night.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.857
(Bobby sighs)

18:44.891 --> 18:46.859
I don't know where to go.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.531
Usually, I finish my shift,
check in with Athena,

18:51.564 --> 18:55.168
ask her if she wants takeout,
or she wants me to cook.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.670
Oh, you guys get into a fight
or something?

18:57.704 --> 19:00.106
She asked me to move in.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.843
I feel like if I show up,
she's gonna want an answer,

19:03.876 --> 19:05.945
and if I don't, then...

19:05.978 --> 19:08.348
Then it'll feel like an answer?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.517
Yeah.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.952
And I know how much it took
for her to put that out there,

19:12.985 --> 19:15.188
and the last thing
I want to do is hurt her.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.460
(inhales deeply)
Bobby...

19:20.493 --> 19:23.230
you guys deserve to be happy.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.366
It would be great
if that was together,

19:26.399 --> 19:28.735
but if it's not, if you...

19:28.768 --> 19:31.471
if you don't see a future
with her,

19:31.504 --> 19:34.241
you can't pretend that you do.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.309
She's had enough of that.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.311
You have to just
tell her the truth.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.514
Well, the truth is that I...

19:41.548 --> 19:43.550
felt panic.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.688
Well, maybe that's your answer.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.361
BUCK: Eddie's sleeping with her,
but he's lying about it.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.863
It's like he's having an affair
with his own wife.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.265
You don't think that's weird?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.199
CHIMNEY: I think
it's none of our business.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.101
Now can we please
focus on the trees?

20:02.134 --> 20:04.203
Now, exactly how pissed off
is Maddie?

20:04.237 --> 20:07.440
Should I be shopping
for a six-foot apology, or a 12?

20:07.474 --> 20:09.576
Uh, pissed off at you for what?

20:09.609 --> 20:12.245
For kicking you off
of my couch and onto hers.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.080
It's an air mattress,
and she is fine.

20:14.113 --> 20:17.049
If anything, I should be the one
holding a grudge, which I will

20:17.083 --> 20:21.754
if you don't hurry up
and pick a tree already.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.591
Wait. Are you seriously
googling Christmas trees?

20:24.624 --> 20:28.227
I want to buy Maddie a gift,
and I want it to be perfect.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.196
I'm gonna go find someone
to help us.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
You stop overthinking
and just pick one.

20:32.265 --> 20:37.270
* It's the most wonderful time
of the year *

20:37.304 --> 20:42.141
* There'll be much mistletoeing
and hearts will be glowing *

20:42.174 --> 20:45.278
* When loved ones are near

20:45.312 --> 20:49.048
* It's the most wonderful time
of the year... *

20:49.081 --> 20:51.083
I need your help here, Big Man.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.725
Real cute.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.428
* There'll be parties
for hosting... *

21:01.461 --> 21:03.596
Big Man like God?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.598
Or Big Man in the Red Suit?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.467
Blue suit, actually.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.437
Santa Haraboji.
It's a Korean thing.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.838
Though I haven't really
given him a shout-out

21:11.871 --> 21:13.640
since I was nine,
but I had no idea

21:13.673 --> 21:15.842
there were so many different
varieties of Christmas trees.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.077
-So it's an important purchase?
-It's for a friend,

21:18.110 --> 21:21.848
but she really loves Christmas,
and I want to surprise her.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.316
A gift for the girlfriend. Nice.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.917
No, it's not like that.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.819
Uh, she had a rough year.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.455
Couple of rough years, I guess.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.023
This is our first Christmas
together...

21:31.057 --> 21:35.261
as friends, and I really,
really want it to be special.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.197
I'd go with the noble fir.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.199
It's a classic for a reason.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.369
* Oh, the most wonderful...

21:42.402 --> 21:44.303
All right. Thank you
for your guidance.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.172
Jason. Jason Bailey.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.474
* Of the year.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.208
All right.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.544
Noble fir it is, Jason Bailey.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.212
*

21:53.245 --> 21:55.114
BUCK:
Ho, ho, ho.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.183
-Surprise.
-MADDIE: Oh.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.218
Wow. A Christmas tree.

21:59.251 --> 22:00.787
CHIMNEY:
Yeah.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.856
Buck said you didn't
have one yet.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.858
Uh, is this okay?

22:05.892 --> 22:07.894
-Is this the wrong kind
of surprise?
-No, no, no.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.562
No. It's so sweet.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.030
Really, I-I love
that you did this.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.132
You just didn't want it.
That's okay.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.067
I mean, we shouldn't have
assumed.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.637
I just really wasn't gonna do
much Christmas this year,

22:17.670 --> 22:21.340
'cause all of my decorations and
stuff are back in Pennsylvania.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.643
And that is why we bought
everything you need.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.077
We have lights,
we have ornaments.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.479
We even have...

22:26.513 --> 22:28.848
an angel high
for on top of the tree.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.850
No. Angels are creepy.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.885
CHIMNEY: You know what, I think
we might have overstepped.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.687
Maddie should be able to
pick out her own decorations.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.155
We'll just, we'll just,

22:36.188 --> 22:37.724
we'll just bring this back
to the store.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.891
What are you talking about?

22:38.925 --> 22:40.493
You can't return a tree.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.862
Hey, come on. You always loved
Christmas, right?

22:42.895 --> 22:45.432
Ornaments, stockings, cookies.
You made your own bows.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.401
Yeah. I'm not really feeling
the holiday this year, okay?

22:48.435 --> 22:50.437
Well, no. (scoffs)
No, it's not okay.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.071
Come on,
what's going on with you?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.673
I don't want to talk about it.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.341
CHIMNEY:
Guys, it's fine.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.444
You know what? (grunts)
I'm just gonna...

22:57.477 --> 22:59.712
take away the evidence
before, uh,

22:59.746 --> 23:01.113
this turns into
a crime scene, okay.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.950
So you hate Christmas now?

23:03.983 --> 23:06.185
Something else
I can thank Doug for, huh?

23:06.218 --> 23:07.754
No, I don't hate Christmas,
but I'm starting not

23:07.787 --> 23:09.388
to like you very much, okay?

23:09.422 --> 23:11.057
-Just let it go.
-Maddie...

23:11.090 --> 23:12.692
You can't come into my house,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.761
-Buck, and act this way.
-"Come into my house"?

23:14.794 --> 23:16.295
I'm your brother.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.431
(arguing continues)

23:18.465 --> 23:21.400
Happy holidays.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.202
(sighs)

23:23.235 --> 23:27.540
* With your Christmas of white

23:27.574 --> 23:29.709
* But I'll have a blue...

23:29.742 --> 23:31.711
(sighs)

23:31.744 --> 23:33.780
Bah, humbug.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.516
* Doo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh. *

23:42.288 --> 23:43.490
HOST (over recording):
Aloha and Merry Christmas.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.924
Romance is in the air tonight

23:44.957 --> 23:46.593
here at Terri's Tiki Room,
literally.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.595
Be sure to steal a kiss
or two under the mistle-drone

23:48.628 --> 23:50.262
and celebrate the season.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.264
Drone photos of your magic
moment are available.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.332
Ask your server.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.735
JENNA: You hooked up with Stacy
of all people.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.169
At least she knew
what she wanted.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.771
Do you, uh, know what you want?

23:58.805 --> 23:59.972
Be right back with your apps.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.774
HOST (over recording):
Aloha and Merry Christmas.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.743
You like apps.
Tinder, Bumble, Match.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.612
You're still on all of them.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.079
Yeah. I'm on them
because I'm single,

24:07.113 --> 24:08.815
and I'm single because
you said so.

24:08.848 --> 24:13.152
What I said was it was too soon
for Christmas with your family.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.121
You're a commitment-phobe
and you were just looking

24:15.154 --> 24:16.856
for an excuse--
a reason to check out.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.190
HOST:
And don't forget

24:18.224 --> 24:19.626
Tuesdays are two-for-one
Bahama Mama

24:19.659 --> 24:22.829
and all-you-can-eat sticky
ginger chicken wing night

24:22.862 --> 24:24.463
-at Terri's Tiki Room.
-I needed a minute.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.500
Things were moving too fast.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.301
I'm not phobic.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.703
I'm afraid.

24:30.737 --> 24:34.040
-Those mean the same thing.
-(scoffs)

24:34.073 --> 24:35.441
What the hell are you afraid of?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.144
This.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.579
(screams)

24:47.854 --> 24:49.856
EDDIE:
Anything?

24:49.889 --> 24:51.524
Not yet.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.192
It's not like it can roll.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.561
Maybe it bounced.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.663
-Not that bad, right?
-TRAVIS: No.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.698
And they can,
they can reattach it. Right?

24:58.731 --> 25:01.400
Yeah, the cut looks
pretty clean.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.469
We'll find the tissue,
pack it in ice.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.538
There's an excellent chance
you're gonna be good as new.

25:05.572 --> 25:09.041
A-And even if they couldn't,
I wouldn't care.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.544
Might need to up your comfort
game a little there, Romeo.

25:11.578 --> 25:14.647
Look, I didn't mean
to move too fast,

25:14.681 --> 25:17.584
but I just figured when you know
something, you double down.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.485
-But then you backed off.
-JENNA: And you ran away.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.920
You pushed me away.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.055
I told you, I got scared.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.057
Because you didn't want
to be with me.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.493
Doesn't that mean I'm supposed
to let you go?

25:27.526 --> 25:30.496
Look, may-maybe she didn't
want you to move on.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.565
She just probably needed
a minute.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.333
Well, how was he supposed
to know that?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.368
All right. Okay. All right.
Listen. Look.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.104
People aren't afraid
of what they know.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.872
They're afraid of what
they don't.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.208
It's a hard thing to hand
someone else the keys

25:42.241 --> 25:43.910
to your heart
and your happiness.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.545
And then you realize
that losing them would mean

25:46.579 --> 25:48.681
losing a part of yourself.

25:48.715 --> 25:52.084
BUCK:
Hey. (grunts) Found it.

25:55.622 --> 25:58.557
* Let it snow

25:58.591 --> 26:01.193
* It doesn't show signs
of stopping *

26:01.227 --> 26:03.195
-Sorry, man.
-Oh, sorry.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.396
* And I've brought
some corn... *

26:04.430 --> 26:06.398
That's your idea
of a Christmas movie?

26:06.432 --> 26:09.235
Holy crap. Jason... uh, Bailey.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.703
-(laughs): Yeah.
-What are you talking about?

26:10.737 --> 26:13.439
-Die Hard is a holiday classic.
-Really? I don't know.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.974
I guess I always saw it
as a movie

26:15.007 --> 26:16.609
about a guy trying to keep
his marriage together...

26:16.643 --> 26:18.945
-with terrorists.
-At Christmas.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.813
So what are you doing here?

26:20.847 --> 26:22.615
I thought you'd be up to your
eyeballs in pine needles.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.952
I'm just trying to find a gift
for my special someone.

26:25.985 --> 26:29.221
What about you?
How did that tree go over?

26:29.255 --> 26:30.623
Badly.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.458
I'm not sure what to do.

26:32.491 --> 26:35.127
I think I've really
screwed things up.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.329
Well, your boy McClane screwed
things up with Holly, right?

26:37.363 --> 26:40.466
More than once, if I recall.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.501
But he won her back
in the end, didn't he?

26:42.534 --> 26:45.404
You know what? You're right.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.439
I'm gonna try again.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.608
Uh, just this.

26:52.812 --> 26:55.614
(Chimney sighs)

26:55.648 --> 26:57.083
What's up, man?
You lose something?

26:57.116 --> 27:00.519
-(chuckles) Yeah, my wallet.
-Oh, no.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.022
-Here, I got it. No, I got it.
-No, it's okay.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.257
-Look, I'll just, um...
-There you go.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.326
And take that so you can get out
of the parking structure.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.261
-No, it's probably in my car.
-In case it's not.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.097
I can't ask you to do that.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.666
You didn't ask, I offered.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.134
Thanks. You know,

27:15.167 --> 27:16.669
uh, I'll come to the lot
and pay you back.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.370
Don't worry about it.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.940
It's kind of a miracle
that I ran into you.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.275
* Let it snow, let is snow

27:23.309 --> 27:24.877
(mimics Alan Rickman):
It's Christmas, Theo.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.979
It's the time of miracles.

27:29.716 --> 27:33.185
* Let it snow.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.620
CHIMNEY:
Thank you very much.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.189
EDDIE: I offered to wait
in line with him,

27:37.223 --> 27:39.025
but he said this is,
uh, private.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.559
Christopher.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.394
BUCK:
I really admire that kid.

27:42.428 --> 27:45.397
I love the way he always wants
to do everything on his own.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.699
EDDIE (laughs):
Yeah.

27:46.733 --> 27:49.969
So... not gonna say anything?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.403
Nah. About what?

27:51.437 --> 27:52.805
You know what about.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.073
I figured it was none
of my business.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.307
It's not.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.642
That's what I'm saying.

27:56.675 --> 27:57.877
It just kind of happened, okay?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.078
It's not like I planned it.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.847
(chuckles) I never said you did.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.648
I only even reached out to her
because I needed her help

28:02.681 --> 28:04.250
getting Christopher into
his new school.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.719
-Totally understandable.
-We just kind of...

28:06.753 --> 28:09.822
-ended up in bed.
-Ah, these things happen.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.323
It's not like you're breaking
any commandments.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.825
You guys are still married.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.761
Yeah.

28:14.794 --> 28:19.065
I'm sneaking around behind
my kid's back with his mother.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.767
Christopher doesn't know?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.401
I don't know what he knows.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.871
These kids sense things, right?

28:24.904 --> 28:26.505
The other day,
I made her sneak out

28:26.538 --> 28:27.740
so he wouldn't see her there.

28:27.774 --> 28:29.241
Trying to protect your kid.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.210
I mean, she ran out
on him, right?

28:31.243 --> 28:33.545
*

28:33.579 --> 28:35.147
I ran out first.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.387
I ran out on both of them.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.056
See, when Christopher was first
diagnosed I was in Afghanistan.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.725
Right at the end of my tour.

28:46.759 --> 28:50.763
Instead of going back home...

28:50.797 --> 28:52.531
I reenlisted.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.134
I told myself it was
to pay the bills.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.237
But you were running away, too.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.941
Yeah. But I got to pretend like
it was for a noble cause.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.742
Serving my country.

29:03.776 --> 29:07.479
But when Shannon broke,
nobody thought she was a hero.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.215
She just got called evil.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.818
And now she wants back
in his life.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.553
-Yeah.
-So why don't you let her?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.789
Seems like she's already
back in yours.

29:16.823 --> 29:20.159
That's... that's what's
got me confused.

29:20.192 --> 29:24.997
Would I be doing it
for Christopher or for me?

29:25.031 --> 29:27.266
I guess sex complicates
everything.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.169
(chuckles)
You said it, brother.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.637
Uh, hey.

29:31.670 --> 29:35.174
How'd it go, pal?

29:35.207 --> 29:37.743
It went great.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.012
-So what'd you ask for?
-Can't tell.

29:40.046 --> 29:42.248
Santa said he'd work on it.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.116
-Oh, man...
-(Buck laughs)

29:44.150 --> 29:46.285
Let's go.

29:46.318 --> 29:49.755
-Ooh.
-Wah. (laughs)

29:49.788 --> 29:53.292
You two have an adorable son.

29:53.325 --> 29:58.197
(chuckles)
Um... Thank you.

30:02.701 --> 30:05.972
-Dad. Is Santa real?
-Hmm?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.340
Is Santa real? Why?

30:08.374 --> 30:10.042
Did someone say he wasn't?

30:11.177 --> 30:12.845
What do you think?

30:12.879 --> 30:14.646
Do you think he's real?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.782
W-When you were gone,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.852
I asked Santa for you
to come back, and you did.

30:19.886 --> 30:22.588
When I was in Afghanistan?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.029
You know, buddy,

30:30.062 --> 30:34.233
Christmas wishes aren't like
birthday wishes. Yeah.

30:34.266 --> 30:38.337
You can say them out loud
and they'll still come true.

30:38.370 --> 30:42.741
I asked him to find Mom.
Will he?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.483
He's sure gonna try.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.520
So I asked Ms. Rangley
and she said it was okay

30:54.553 --> 30:57.356
to FaceTime during the
performance so you can see it.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.159
Um, what time will it be
over there in a half an hour?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.361
I don't care what time it is.
I'm not missing

31:02.394 --> 31:05.397
my little girl's first solo
with the choir.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.200
I miss you, Daddy.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.669
-It's been so long.
-I know.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.404
But you just go get ready,

31:12.438 --> 31:14.606
and I promise we'll be hugging
real soon.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.676
Yeah, in a month.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.045
Break a leg.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.446
I love you.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.114
I love you, too.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.116
-Surprising her?
-I've been traveling

31:24.150 --> 31:25.584
for 30 hours straight.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.886
Every form of transport
you can imagine.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.057
Jeep, Humvee, APV, helicopter,

31:31.090 --> 31:34.426
737, and now city bus,

31:34.460 --> 31:36.228
all to make it home in time

31:36.262 --> 31:38.797
to hear my little girl sing
in the choir.

31:38.830 --> 31:42.268
Is this bus usually on time?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.103
I've got to make
the crosstown connector

31:44.136 --> 31:46.205
-and I don't want to miss it.
-WOMAN: Relax.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.707
The good Lord wouldn't let you
miss such an important event

31:48.740 --> 31:50.642
after all you've done
to get there.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.283
CLEMENS:
Hey.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.951
Hey, you took that man's wallet.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.752
Piss off, Top Gun.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.488
That's the Navy, son.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.090
I'm a Marine.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.791
Now give that man back
his wallet

32:05.824 --> 32:07.059
and I won't call the cops.

32:07.093 --> 32:07.994
(horn honking)

32:21.373 --> 32:23.942
Let's see what we got.

32:23.976 --> 32:26.445
I'll take the driver.

32:26.478 --> 32:29.681
So, I don't know how, but we
have mostly minor injuries,

32:29.715 --> 32:32.184
some cuts and bruises,
except for this guy,

32:32.218 --> 32:34.253
and I don't know
if he's gonna make it.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.256
-Sergeant.
-That truck came
out of nowhere, man.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.458
Piece of glass clipped him
in the neck.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.193
Feels like it hit
a major artery.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.661
EDDIE: Carotid.
You got your finger in the hole?

32:42.694 --> 32:44.430
That's what we're trained to do.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.432
I've seen it before,
unfortunately.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.434
-Me, too. Where were you?
-Leatherneck.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.037
-Ah. I was at Bagram.
-Army?

32:51.070 --> 32:53.139
-Uh-huh.
-Nobody's perfect.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.807
Let's run the fluids wide open.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.777
You mind keeping
your finger there for a moment?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.346
You don't have anywhere
to be, right?

33:00.379 --> 33:01.513
Right.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.782
-I'm good.
-Okay.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.152
(helicopter blades whirring)

33:07.919 --> 33:10.056
EDDIE:
On three. One,

33:10.089 --> 33:11.823
two, three.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.960
All right.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.529
All right, let's move him
out of here, guys.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.401
All right, keep the pressure.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.173
All right, he's stabilizing.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.079
Is he gonna make it?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.383
Thanks to you, Marine.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.652
How you feeling?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.020
I'm fine.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.822
Anything else I can do?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.191
We're good.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.426
Thank you for your service.
Literally.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.378
(sighs)

34:06.412 --> 34:08.714
-You got it.
-All right, we'll take him.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.753
I hear you have a show
to get to, Marine.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.889
Yeah. But I'm
never gonna make it.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.725
Oh, yes, you are.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.127
Let's go.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.269
*

34:30.302 --> 34:32.070
-(horn honking, siren wailing)
-Better hurry up

34:32.104 --> 34:34.640
and get dressed-- we're gonna
be there before you know it.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.376
I'm gonna cry.
I-I know I'm gonna cry.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.712
Those soldier reunion videos
on YouTube always get me.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.314
(horn honking)

34:59.298 --> 35:00.966
(microphone feedback)

35:02.834 --> 35:05.204
(gentle piano intro plays)

35:07.773 --> 35:09.741
HOPE:
* I'll

35:09.775 --> 35:12.511
* Be home

35:12.544 --> 35:15.414
* For Christmas

35:15.447 --> 35:17.183
* Doo, doo, doo *

35:17.216 --> 35:19.017
* You

35:19.050 --> 35:21.253
* Can plan

35:21.287 --> 35:24.190
* On me

35:26.725 --> 35:28.427
* Please

35:28.460 --> 35:30.862
* Have snow

35:30.896 --> 35:34.032
* And mistletoe

35:35.301 --> 35:38.437
* And presents

35:38.470 --> 35:40.306
* On

35:40.339 --> 35:43.175
* The tree

35:45.244 --> 35:47.779
* Christmas

35:47.813 --> 35:49.515
* Eve

35:49.548 --> 35:52.684
* Will find me

35:52.718 --> 35:54.953
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

35:54.986 --> 35:56.655
* Where

35:56.688 --> 35:59.658
* The love-light

35:59.691 --> 36:02.027
* Gleams

36:04.730 --> 36:06.164
* I'll

36:06.198 --> 36:08.800
* Be home

36:08.834 --> 36:12.404
* For Christmas

36:13.705 --> 36:16.242
-(gasps)
-* If only *

36:16.275 --> 36:17.676
* In *

36:17.709 --> 36:19.711
* My dreams *

36:22.180 --> 36:24.082
(cheering)

36:26.752 --> 36:28.220
* I'll *

36:28.254 --> 36:30.589
* Be home *

36:30.622 --> 36:35.093
* For Christmas *

36:35.126 --> 36:38.230
-* If only *
-Every time.

36:38.264 --> 36:40.031
* In *

36:40.065 --> 36:41.900
* My dreams *

36:44.703 --> 36:47.906
* If only *

36:47.939 --> 36:49.841
* In *

36:49.875 --> 36:52.143
* My dreams... *

36:54.212 --> 36:56.114
(song ends)

37:02.788 --> 37:05.424
("The Christmas Song"
by Nat King Cole playing)

37:05.457 --> 37:07.793
* Chestnuts roasting...

37:07.826 --> 37:09.094
Hi.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.598
Glad you came.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.600
-* Jack Frost nipping
-I wasn't sure.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.635
* At your nose

37:19.338 --> 37:22.408
I thought I scared you off.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.744
I really shouldn't have
sprung that on you like that.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.280
I just, uh, I wasn't thinking.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.449
Well, you were feeling.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.783
You were speaking
from your heart,

37:31.817 --> 37:33.452
which is something
that I love about you.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.154
Which brings me to this.
Merry Christmas.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.756
* And some mistletoe

37:37.789 --> 37:39.958
Y-You don't want to wait
till morning?

37:39.991 --> 37:41.627
I don't want to wait
another minute.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.195
* Help to make
the season bright *

37:45.331 --> 37:46.865
(laughs)

37:48.166 --> 37:50.502
(gasps softly)

37:50.536 --> 37:51.970
Bobby!

37:52.003 --> 37:54.573
You offered me a key. So...

37:54.606 --> 37:56.975
* Find it hard to sleep
tonight *

37:57.008 --> 37:59.144
I don't want to take
the next step.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.279
I want to take every step,
with you,

38:01.313 --> 38:03.649
for the rest of our lives.
Marry me, Athena.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.951
-Bobby.
-I know it might feel
sudden and fast,

38:05.984 --> 38:07.853
but we both know how life works.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.688
-Yeah.
-Life is fleeting

38:09.721 --> 38:11.957
and it's precious, and when
you find happiness and you find

38:11.990 --> 38:13.659
somebody who fills your heart,
gives you hope

38:13.692 --> 38:15.461
for the future and faith
in yourself, you have...

38:15.494 --> 38:17.629
Bobby! Yes!

38:17.663 --> 38:19.164
Yes?

38:19.197 --> 38:21.333
(softly):
Yes.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.769
You really said yes.
It's a Christmas miracle.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.805
Just put the damn ring
on my finger.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.775
* And so I'm offering...

38:29.808 --> 38:33.979
-Mm. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.215
* To kids from one

38:37.248 --> 38:38.417
* To 92

38:41.353 --> 38:42.888
* Although

38:42.921 --> 38:44.356
-* It's been said
-(alarm beeping)

38:44.390 --> 38:46.191
-* Many times
-Dad!

38:46.224 --> 38:47.893
-* Many ways
-Dad? Wake up!

38:47.926 --> 38:50.829
-* Merry Christmas
-It's Christmas!

38:50.862 --> 38:53.365
* To you

38:53.399 --> 38:55.534
*

39:08.780 --> 39:10.882
* And so I'm

39:10.916 --> 39:12.918
-* Offering
-Mommy! Mommy!

39:12.951 --> 39:15.186
-* This simple phrase
-(Shannon squeals)

39:15.220 --> 39:17.355
Oh! Merry Christmas, baby.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.057
* To kids from one

39:19.090 --> 39:22.193
-* To 92
-I missed you so much.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.664
* Although it's been said

39:25.697 --> 39:27.899
I knew Santa could do it again.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.235
-* Many times, many ways
-(laughter)

39:30.268 --> 39:32.604
* Merry Christmas

39:35.373 --> 39:37.743
* To you.

39:37.776 --> 39:41.747
Okay, we've got turkey,
ham and six different sides.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.914
Forget about the food.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.183
-What you have here is taste!
-I mean,

39:45.216 --> 39:47.185
I mean, I know
they call diamonds rocks,

39:47.218 --> 39:48.720
but this is a rock star.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.288
I mean, is your hand tired?

39:50.321 --> 39:51.757
'Cause I could help you
carry that,

39:51.790 --> 39:53.525
for a while,
if you need a little help.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.393
BOBBY: It is a promise
to Athena and her family

39:55.427 --> 39:58.096
for a lifetime
of happiness, love

39:58.129 --> 40:00.098
and all the home-cooked meals
you can eat.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.767
Oh, that's sweet.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.436
But let's not forget
it's also a big damn diamond.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.237
(laughter)

40:06.271 --> 40:07.939
-(doorbell rings)
-You got that?

40:07.973 --> 40:09.775
-Yeah.
-All right.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.910
-Merry Christmas.
-Ah. Thanks for inviting me.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.447
I brought Christmas, and...
I brought congratulations.

40:15.481 --> 40:17.783
Ah, thank you.
Well, you are always welcome.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.818
Maddie didn't want to join us?

40:19.851 --> 40:22.888
I think this year she needed
a different kind of Christmas.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.857
-All right, well, come on in.
-All right. I'm excited.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.563
(knocking)

40:31.597 --> 40:35.233
Behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.335
Chinese food and Die Hard,

40:37.368 --> 40:39.638
the greatest
Christmas movie ever made.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.139
I'm sorry.

40:41.172 --> 40:43.609
-About the tree. I shouldn't...
-Whoa-ho-ho.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.612
Christmas is supposed to be
about feeling safe and warm

40:46.645 --> 40:49.748
with the people you care about;
that's the gift.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.917
What it's wrapped in
doesn't matter.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.752
Who needs a tree?

40:53.785 --> 40:56.421
* Round yon virgin

40:56.454 --> 40:57.455
Well...

40:57.489 --> 40:59.491
I decided I do.

40:59.525 --> 41:02.027
I didn't steal it.
Someone left it on the sidewalk,

41:02.060 --> 41:03.995
and I didn't have a lot of time,

41:04.029 --> 41:06.097
so it's not perfect, but...

41:06.131 --> 41:07.999
Well, who needs perfect?

41:08.033 --> 41:09.300
It's, uh...

41:09.334 --> 41:11.102
it's beautiful.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.505
So what made you change
your mind?

41:13.539 --> 41:16.041
MADDIE: The holidays with Doug,
they weren't a celebration.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.544
It was a performance.

41:18.577 --> 41:22.848
You know, pretending to be a...
happy couple that had it all.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.983
I just didn't want
to pretend this year.

41:25.016 --> 41:28.053
But then I realized
that he's taken enough from me.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.556
I'm not gonna let him take
one more thing,

41:30.589 --> 41:33.992
and I sure as hell am not
gonna let him take Christmas.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.461
Last year was
my worst Christmas ever.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.797
But maybe also my best,

41:38.830 --> 41:41.399
because that's the day
I decided to leave.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.406
Now, that is a good reason
to deck the halls.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.542
* Silent

41:50.576 --> 41:52.811
* Night

41:52.844 --> 41:55.046
* Holy

41:55.080 --> 41:56.514
-* Night
-(object shatters)

41:57.616 --> 42:02.220
* Son of God

42:02.253 --> 42:05.356
* Love's pure light

42:06.858 --> 42:09.160
* Radiant

42:09.194 --> 42:10.929
* Beams

42:10.962 --> 42:12.664
* From Thy

42:12.698 --> 42:16.001
* Holy face

42:16.034 --> 42:17.869
* With

42:17.903 --> 42:19.838
-* The dawn
-(footsteps approaching)

42:19.871 --> 42:22.941
* Of redeeming

42:22.974 --> 42:25.276
* Grace

42:25.310 --> 42:29.114
-Doug...
-Shh.

42:29.147 --> 42:32.050
I know you tried so hard.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.452
It just wasn't right.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.622
It wasn't perfect.

42:38.724 --> 42:42.193
You'll get it right.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.395
Someday you'll get it right.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.933
(kisses)

43:02.180 --> 43:05.583

You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

43:49.861 --> 43:52.297
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:54.632 --> 43:55.834
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.505
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:00.538 --> 44:04.109
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:04.142 --> 44:07.679
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:07.713 --> 44:08.714
MAN: Touchdown!

44:08.747 --> 44:12.317
* Reach out *

44:12.350 --> 44:15.954
* Make this right here
right now *

44:15.987 --> 44:18.890
* Stand up *

44:19.758 --> 44:21.526
* Here right now *

44:21.559 --> 44:23.528
That sounds like fun.
