00:13.331 --> 00:16.299
<b>6x12 - "Destiny" </b>

00:22.841 --> 00:25.344
<i>Blinded by the dark side!</i>

00:25.386 --> 00:28.305
<i>The Jedi Council has begun
to unravel the mystery</i>

00:28.347 --> 00:30.349
<i>of how the clone army was created</i>

00:30.391 --> 00:34.603
<i>and now fear the Sith Lord
Count Dooku was behind it.</i>

00:34.644 --> 00:38.774
<i>Master Yoda searches for answers,
and during deep meditation,</i>

00:38.815 --> 00:41.985
<i>he is able to contact the spirit
of Qui-Gon Jinn,</i>

00:42.027 --> 00:44.445
<i>who reveals to Yoda
that he must manifest</i>

00:44.487 --> 00:46.447
<i>his consciousness after death</i>

00:46.489 --> 00:49.450
<i>if he is to preserve the Jedi Order.</i>

00:49.492 --> 00:52.454
<i>Now we find Master Yoda
deep in space,</i>

00:52.495 --> 00:55.082
<i>searching for a path
to ones who will teach him</i>

00:55.124 --> 00:58.668
<i>all he does not know of the Force.</i>

01:03.799 --> 01:06.885
The place Qui-Gon spoke of
I believe this is.

01:12.808 --> 01:15.644
So blocking our scanners
the gas is,

01:15.685 --> 01:17.771
but inside a planet may be.

01:17.813 --> 01:21.733
Mm, sense it, I do.

01:42.421 --> 01:43.880
Controlling this are you?

01:49.678 --> 01:52.722
Let the Force guide, I will.

02:42.147 --> 02:46.776
Hmm, awake again you are,
my little friend.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.279
Where we are, I'm not sure,

02:49.321 --> 02:52.282
but strong with the Force
this place is.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.751
There, you see?

03:02.792 --> 03:05.379
From inside the planet,
life emanates.

03:11.176 --> 03:13.470
Here nothing
your scanners can see, hmm?

03:15.305 --> 03:19.059
Need this I will not.

03:21.644 --> 03:24.481
No, wait here you must.

03:24.523 --> 03:26.775
A journey for me alone this is.

03:30.487 --> 03:34.116
Safer here you are, my friend.

04:31.423 --> 04:32.966
<i>Yoda.</i>

04:33.008 --> 04:35.218
Who is there?

04:35.260 --> 04:37.262
<i>Yoda.</i>

04:39.431 --> 04:42.017
Traveled far I have,

04:42.058 --> 04:44.311
looking for those who can teach me.

04:44.353 --> 04:49.774
The question is,
are you worthy of being taught?

04:59.784 --> 05:01.244
You are late.

05:01.286 --> 05:04.080
We have been waiting for you,
Master Yoda.

05:04.122 --> 05:05.332
Late?

05:05.374 --> 05:07.626
How did you know, coming, I was?

05:07.668 --> 05:10.837
We watch and study all who are strong

05:10.879 --> 05:12.922
with the Force in the universe.

05:12.964 --> 05:16.343
Now, come, if we are to begin.

05:49.459 --> 05:52.504
Cousins, I have a guest.

05:55.131 --> 05:58.635
You should not
have brought him before us.

05:58.677 --> 06:01.804
Oh, nonsense.
He is full of the Force.

06:01.846 --> 06:03.515
Can you not feel it?

06:03.557 --> 06:06.142
Why is he here?

06:06.184 --> 06:09.812
Why are you here?

06:09.854 --> 06:12.524
Told I was to learn from you,

06:12.566 --> 06:17.153
that show me you could how
to manifest my life after death.

06:17.195 --> 06:19.864
Oh, it's impossible.

06:19.906 --> 06:22.033
He will fail with the great gift.

06:22.075 --> 06:25.828
He will disappoint us.
He will disappoint himself.

06:25.870 --> 06:29.499
Oh, no.
No, I do not see that.

06:29.541 --> 06:34.671
His destiny is already set.
It is not for us to decide.

06:34.713 --> 06:37.424
But why him?

06:37.466 --> 06:40.135
He is to teach one
that will save the universe

06:40.176 --> 06:42.137
from a great imbalance.

06:42.178 --> 06:46.057
For this, the great gift will be his.

06:46.099 --> 06:49.603
He has no idea what he seeks,

06:49.645 --> 06:51.980
the responsibility he will have.

06:52.021 --> 06:57.360
Understand I do not.
Guide me I know you will.

06:57.402 --> 06:59.529
And do you realize what you must do,

06:59.571 --> 07:01.156
what you must face?

07:01.197 --> 07:03.575
No.

07:03.617 --> 07:04.867
Good.

07:04.909 --> 07:06.703
Then you won't be afraid.

07:12.751 --> 07:19.299
Do I have a blessing
that the training can begin?

07:19.341 --> 07:20.425
It is so.

07:20.467 --> 07:24.471
We are one, and one is all.

07:24.513 --> 07:27.641
Do you come to us
with only good intention

07:27.683 --> 07:30.185
and light in your heart?

07:30.226 --> 07:32.270
I do.
Yes.

07:32.312 --> 07:38.360
Then the blessing I give,
and the training will begin.

07:46.993 --> 07:50.038
Disappoint us
not, little green one.

07:59.088 --> 08:00.757
What is this place?

08:00.799 --> 08:03.968
All that surrounds us
is the foundation of life,

08:04.010 --> 08:06.596
the birthplace of what your science

08:06.638 --> 08:09.057
calls midi-chlorians,

08:09.098 --> 08:10.350
the foundation of what connects

08:10.392 --> 08:14.270
the Living Force and the Cosmic Force.

08:14.312 --> 08:18.191
When a living thing dies,
all is removed.

08:18.233 --> 08:20.527
Life passes from the Living Force

08:20.569 --> 08:25.114
into the Cosmic Force
and becomes one with it.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.909
One powers the other.

08:27.950 --> 08:30.953
One is renewed by the other.

08:30.995 --> 08:34.123
This I know.

08:34.164 --> 08:37.626
Come with me.

08:41.631 --> 08:45.719
At death, in order for you
to preserve your identity,

08:45.761 --> 08:49.556
you must know yourself, your true self,

08:49.598 --> 08:53.393
and then let go.

08:53.435 --> 08:57.063
On that island dwells
all that remains unconquered,

08:57.105 --> 08:59.816
what, in your existence,
some call evil,

08:59.858 --> 09:02.819
otherwise known as fear,

09:02.861 --> 09:05.947
all which must be finally overcome

09:05.988 --> 09:08.909
before the journey can be taken.

09:08.950 --> 09:11.953
Free yourself, you must.

09:11.994 --> 09:14.247
A Jedi Master I am.

09:14.289 --> 09:17.751
Know all that dwells within I do.

09:17.793 --> 09:21.296
Mastered my weaknesses
and conquered my fears I have.

09:21.337 --> 09:23.381
Have you?

09:23.423 --> 09:28.845
You must face your evil on
that island and defeat it.

09:59.793 --> 10:02.337
<i>Yoda.</i>

10:13.807 --> 10:16.852
<i>Yoda.</i>

10:28.488 --> 10:30.490
<i>Yoda.</i>

10:32.408 --> 10:34.452
Show yourself.

10:37.330 --> 10:41.125
Yoda hates me.
Yes.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.961
Mm-hmm.

10:48.550 --> 10:52.762
Yoda plays not with me anymore.

10:52.804 --> 10:55.181
Yoda thinks me not worthy.

11:08.069 --> 11:10.405
Yoda recognizes you not.

11:11.614 --> 11:15.201
See not what is inside Yoda?

11:15.243 --> 11:17.453
I choose not to give you power.

11:17.495 --> 11:21.750
And yet you spend your days
in the decadence of war,

11:21.791 --> 11:25.461
and with that, I grow inside you.

11:25.503 --> 11:27.881
Know your true self.

11:27.923 --> 11:29.591
Face me now...

11:29.632 --> 11:32.427
or I will devour you.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.786
Part of me you are not.

11:57.827 --> 11:59.161
Part of you I am,

11:59.203 --> 12:02.415
part of all that lives.

12:08.880 --> 12:13.051
Why do you hate
what gives you power?

12:24.479 --> 12:27.607
Yoda thinks me not worthy.

12:30.860 --> 12:33.780
Recognize you I do.

12:33.822 --> 12:36.449
Huh?

12:43.832 --> 12:46.709
Part of me you are, yes.

12:50.005 --> 12:52.590
But power over me you have not.

12:52.632 --> 12:56.094
Through patience and training,
it is I who control you.

13:00.389 --> 13:03.685
Control over me you have not.

13:07.647 --> 13:11.275
My dark side you are.
Reject you I do.

13:25.623 --> 13:28.334
You have conquered your hubris.

13:30.086 --> 13:33.506
Now face the temptations you must.

13:42.598 --> 13:45.601
Powerful
the creature was.

13:45.643 --> 13:49.438
What you faced was
a reflection of your hubris

13:49.480 --> 13:51.149
and the shadow of your soul.

13:51.191 --> 13:54.903
And yet clear I thought I was.

13:54.944 --> 14:00.075
The beast is you, and you are the beast.

14:00.116 --> 14:03.619
To deny it
simply gives it power.

14:03.661 --> 14:06.915
Now I see.
Simple the answer was.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.250
Deep in your core,

14:10.292 --> 14:13.546
you felt that we had nothing
to teach you,

14:13.588 --> 14:16.049
but you must trust in our teachings

14:16.091 --> 14:18.134
if you are to succeed.

14:19.594 --> 14:23.139
Ready I am for what comes next.

14:23.181 --> 14:27.769
You must enter the valley
of extinction.

14:31.231 --> 14:33.649
Pass through without emotion,

14:33.691 --> 14:36.277
without attachment,

14:36.318 --> 14:39.572
for you will see all our faces there,

14:39.614 --> 14:41.824
and they will seduce you.

14:41.866 --> 14:44.577
For we are confusion...

14:44.619 --> 14:47.747
Anger...
Sadness...

14:47.789 --> 14:52.460
Joy...
And Serenity.

15:04.513 --> 15:07.142
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

15:08.726 --> 15:11.229
<i>No! No!</i>

15:36.378 --> 15:38.422
Master Yoda.

15:38.464 --> 15:39.632
Please...

15:40.716 --> 15:42.677
Help me.

15:42.718 --> 15:45.638
I'm... I'm dying.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.515
What has happened here,
Padawan?

15:48.724 --> 15:50.310
Who has done this?

15:54.730 --> 15:55.898
The Sith.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.733
How?

15:57.775 --> 16:00.320
You told me
I would finish my training

16:00.361 --> 16:02.113
and become a Jedi,

16:02.155 --> 16:04.615
but the Council expelled me.

16:04.657 --> 16:07.160
Why would you do that?

16:08.828 --> 16:13.749
Will I still become
one with the Force when I die?

16:13.791 --> 16:18.254
Master, will I be a Jedi?

16:18.296 --> 16:20.548
Padawan.
Padawan?

16:20.589 --> 16:23.092
Ahsoka, no.

16:23.134 --> 16:25.469
No. No.

16:25.511 --> 16:28.139
Not strong enough I was.

16:28.181 --> 16:29.349
No.

16:29.390 --> 16:34.062
Failed I have,
failed them all.

16:34.103 --> 16:37.315
Master Yoda.

16:37.357 --> 16:40.360
Let me take you away
from your confusion,

16:40.401 --> 16:44.488
your anger, your sadness.

16:44.530 --> 16:49.160
Come with me,
and you will never know pain,

16:49.202 --> 16:51.079
never know sadness.

16:54.040 --> 16:58.127
Close your eyes,
and I will guide you.

17:08.262 --> 17:10.348
<i>Wait for me!</i>

17:10.390 --> 17:15.228
The Temple is beautiful,
isn't it, Master Yoda?

17:22.777 --> 17:25.780
Yes, so peaceful,

17:25.820 --> 17:28.074
as it was before the war.

17:28.116 --> 17:29.658
<i>War?</i>

17:29.700 --> 17:31.994
Oh, there is
no war here, Master,

17:32.036 --> 17:35.915
only peace
and tranquility.

17:35.957 --> 17:37.792
No war?

17:49.804 --> 17:51.389
Ah, Master Yoda.

17:51.431 --> 17:53.182
Master Dooku
was just telling us a tale

17:53.224 --> 17:55.351
of when he was your Padawan.

17:55.393 --> 17:57.812
Really quite
a humorous story.

17:57.853 --> 17:59.355
Count Dooku.

17:59.397 --> 18:01.274
Yes, Master.

18:01.316 --> 18:03.192
I was telling them
the tale

18:03.234 --> 18:06.570
of when you faced the giant
terentatek on Kashyyyk.

18:06.612 --> 18:09.740
What a terrible beast
it was.

18:09.782 --> 18:12.701
Yes. Yes.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.829
I remember.

18:14.870 --> 18:18.374
We had wonderful adventures,
Master Yoda and I.

18:18.416 --> 18:20.293
I'm sure
we'd all love to hear more,

18:20.335 --> 18:22.086
but it's time to join the others.

18:25.881 --> 18:29.135
Coming, Master?

18:39.895 --> 18:42.982
No.
Wrong this is.

18:43.024 --> 18:47.195
<i>Lies these images are.
Lies.</i>

18:48.529 --> 18:51.657
Dead I know you to be.

18:51.699 --> 18:55.536
On Naboo, died you did, Qui-Gon.

18:57.121 --> 18:59.665
And a traitor you are,
my old Padawan.

19:15.973 --> 19:19.685
No.
An illusion this is, a falsehood.

19:37.619 --> 19:39.205
You have done well,

19:39.247 --> 19:43.584
but to succeed, your life
must be spent learning,

19:43.625 --> 19:45.169
practicing.

19:45.211 --> 19:49.215
Please show me who you are.

19:49.257 --> 19:51.926
See your face I must.

20:00.435 --> 20:02.603
Now you see.

20:02.644 --> 20:07.483
We have achieved what you seek
and live between the realms.

20:07.525 --> 20:10.152
Dead you are?

20:10.194 --> 20:12.405
<i>Yes.</i>

20:12.447 --> 20:14.990
How shall I complete my training?

20:17.159 --> 20:19.870
You must face the ultimate test,

20:19.912 --> 20:21.747
the ultimate seduction,

20:21.789 --> 20:24.750
the gravest of journeys.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.420
You will travel to Moraband.

20:27.462 --> 20:29.088
Moraband.

20:29.130 --> 20:31.840
Journey through the ancient
homeworld of the Sith.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.343
Face all that you fear,

20:34.385 --> 20:37.721
all that haunts your soul!

20:59.660 --> 21:01.787
Hello, my friend.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.206
No, no.

21:04.248 --> 21:06.875
One more place to visit we have.

21:13.591 --> 21:16.677
A strange place
I have come from,

21:16.718 --> 21:19.847
but finished not what I came for.

21:19.888 --> 21:22.642
Set a course for Moraband.

21:24.852 --> 21:28.481
Yes, brave we must be.

21:28.523 --> 21:32.067
The worst, I fear, is yet to come.
