I'm going to ask Wayne to marry me.

And I want your blessing.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.880
CLAIRE: She smiled, Den.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.920
She's proud.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.440
JAKE: You wanted them.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.680
CIARAN: No, you hit me up so you
could sell your dying mum's drugs.

You're a freak.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.240
Good? Good night?

00:35.040 --> 00:37.760
DEN: I think he was
going through Sarah's stuff.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.160
Hey.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.920
DEN: Someone's interfered with her.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.720
Den, it's not a good idea
to let your imagination go to places.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.800
What is it, Constable?

00:49.280 --> 00:51.200
They found her.

Deborah Munroe is ready for you now.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.200
I don't think I'm gonna go in.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.840
But, Hanna...
HANNA: I don't need to go in there.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.160
I don't need to hear all the details
about her body.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.880
I just...I don't need to.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.200
Yeah. I'll...I'll be here. You go.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.240
Hey, uh, has Claire taken something?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.800
Course not.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.280
MUNROE: We received an anonymous tip
through Crime Stoppers

02:28.280 --> 02:30.400
that gave us a location to search.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.600
A tip from who?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.520
Well, she said it was anonymous.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.480
URSULA: And you're sure it's her?

02:48.880 --> 02:51.520
WAYNE: Ciaran,
maybe you should wait with Hanna.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.960
I'm staying.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.400
MUNROE: OK.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.400
We'll need to confirm her DNA,
but I can get a police officer

02:57.400 --> 03:00.360
to come over later
to collect a sample.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.760
What about... I've got... (SIGHS)

03:04.080 --> 03:05.560
It's her hair.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.920
From her hairbrush.
MUNROE: That's...that's perfect.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.000
Thank you.
CLAIRE: OK.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.280
MUNROE: Thanks, Claire.
No worries.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.600
The body was tangled up in an anchor
that was weighing her down.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.000
What about the anonymous caller?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.120
MUNROE:
Our inquiries are ongoing, Ciaran.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.360
Once the post-mortem examination
is done,

03:26.360 --> 03:28.680
Sarah's body can move
to the funeral home,

03:28.680 --> 03:31.840
so you can all begin
to make funeral arrangements now.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.960
Why can't the police just find out
who made the call to Crime Stoppers?

03:34.960 --> 03:36.960
We're preparing a brief
for the coroner,

03:36.960 --> 03:39.840
who will look very carefully
at all the evidence.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.640
Where exactly was she found?

03:47.320 --> 03:52.520
She was found in this area here,
on the edge of the national park.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.200
Boora Point.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.480
URSULA: And where's she now?

03:56.480 --> 03:59.200
'Cause I'd really like
to see my sister.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.720
MUNROE: I understand.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.720
Sarah's body is at the morgue,
but I would not advise a viewing

04:04.720 --> 04:06.120
before the funeral home.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.280
What if
it's for a spiritual purpose?

04:08.280 --> 04:09.760
I'm sure
the funeral director will handle

04:09.760 --> 04:11.680
all the religious side of things.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.520
Yeah, I know that, I know,
but...but I just...

04:13.520 --> 04:15.240
..you know, I just want to go
with Father Shirley.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.600
I just want to
go with our priest now, and...

04:17.600 --> 04:19.240
..and I just want
to bless my sister.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.360
Ursula, you don't...
Is this necessary?

04:22.360 --> 04:24.920
Saving my sister's soul?
Yeah, actually. I'd say it is.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.720
Can we ask if that is,
uh, possible, please?

04:29.720 --> 04:31.360
I'll be right back.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.880
We both feel the same.
Let's just hear what she has to say.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.800
Uh, I'd better put some, uh,
more money in the meter.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.560
I don't want to get booked.
WAYNE: Yeah, I'll do it.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.640
Oh, no, come. Stay with me, please.
No, no. Just some fresh air.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.520
..there will be a window to visit
the morgue over the next 24 hours.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.720
URSULA: Oh, great.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.760
MUNROE:
There will be a counsellor present.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.640
I doubt that they'll let you see her,
but...you can be with her.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.840
It's just Urs.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.320

05:50.320 --> 05:52.080
I'm still thinking about it.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.160
DEN: Really?

05:54.160 --> 05:56.520
Don't do that, Ciaran.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.960
I know it feels like you should,
but don't do that.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.200
Thank you. Good advice.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.280

06:05.280 --> 06:06.840
you have my number.

URSULA: Yep.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.680
Oh, Urs,
you're not obliged to do it.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.440
CLAIRE: Yeah, Munroe didn't think
it was a good idea.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.000
URSULA: I have permission to go.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.920
DEN: Yeah, but if YOU go,
then, you know.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.920
What?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.680

comes from a good place.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.720
It's very important.

that I wouldn't allow this...

of your wellbeing.

about OUR mum now?

left her fitness thing in that boat.

it might be the same person.

You don't have to come in.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.440
ADRIAN: You can...

27:14.440 --> 27:16.240
..just wait here if you like.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.440
You're Sarah's son?

27:18.440 --> 27:19.840
URSULA: Yeah. Yeah.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.560
Maybe I'll do that.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.040
That's a really great decision,
Ciaran.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.640
Bullshit. No, it isn't.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.360
He's just disappointed in himself.
That's all.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.800
'Cause maybe this is unnecessary.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.960
Please.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.840
We commend you, our dear Sarah,
to Almighty God

28:00.840 --> 28:03.160
and entrust you to your Creator.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.840
May you rest in the arms of the Lord,

28:04.840 --> 28:07.280
who formed you
from the dust of the earth.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.120
May holy Mary,
the angels and all the saints

28:10.120 --> 28:13.160
welcome you now that
you have gone forth from this life.

28:13.160 --> 28:17.720
May Christ, who was crucified
for you, bring you freedom and peace.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.400
May Christ, who died for you...
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

29:03.240 --> 29:04.800
JAKE: I just wanted to apologi...

29:04.800 --> 29:06.200
CIARAN:
Oh, no, this is so inappropriate!

29:06.200 --> 29:08.200
I'm not your fucking counsellor!

29:08.200 --> 29:09.840
What are you doing here?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.800
I'm not gonna be
your fucking grief buddy.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.640
I'm sorry. I just wanted...
No, I don't care.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.200
Oi.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.720
Wait.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.600
Jake!

29:59.080 --> 30:00.760
(EGG CRACKS)

30:13.760 --> 30:16.000
Why have you got the heating on?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.040
Bloody...middle of summer.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.240
I'm cold. (SIGHS)

30:25.200 --> 30:27.920
What time's your meeting
with the funeral director?

30:27.920 --> 30:31.040
URSULA: Oh. Uh, four o'clock.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.600
I've got the accountant at 3:30.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.240
That's OK.
You don't have to be there.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.040
Are you sure?

30:38.040 --> 30:40.680
Yeah. I'll be fine.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.760
OK.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.960
Well, you...

30:43.960 --> 30:45.760
..you weren't fine at the morgue.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.000
Well, I'm...I'm really glad I went.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.480
Father...

30:51.480 --> 30:53.360
..Shirley
said some beautiful things, so...

30:53.360 --> 30:55.920
SCOTT: Yeah. Right.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.840
Keep an eye on the funeral director.
Not cheap.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.240
I know.
And let the others know.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.280
Otherwise they'll be coming to us for
gold-plated coffins or what have you.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.680
Nobody wants that, Scott.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.560
God, those eggs smell funny.

31:11.560 --> 31:13.600
They're fine. I just ate them.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.720
I really want to be there.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.840
URSULA: Mmm.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.520
SCOTT: I won't say anything.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.720
You needn't.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.040
(PHONE BUZZES)

31:29.680 --> 31:31.400
SCOTT: Malcolm.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.560
Yeah. Tell us some good news.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.800

CLAIRE: Hello?

32:07.240 --> 32:09.240
Ali?

32:11.800 --> 32:13.560
ALI: Claire.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.280
CLAIRE: Hey.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.440
Sorry, I was gonna call, but I...

32:17.440 --> 32:18.880
..erm...

32:20.720 --> 32:23.120
..they found Sarah's body.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.080
Shit.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.000
OK.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.280
So is there gonna be, erm, a funeral?

32:32.280 --> 32:33.640
CLAIRE: Yep.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.760
Erm, after the coroner
returns her to us.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.960
I thought you should know.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.320
Appreciate it.

32:43.120 --> 32:44.640
I didn't know you had a boat.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.160
It was here last time.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.760
I guess you were pretty drunk.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.560
Fuck off. (LAUGHS)

32:50.560 --> 32:52.560
ALI: I loved your sister.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.720
And I gave her a ring.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.480
We'd had a fight.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.800
CLAIRE: Oh. What sort of fight?

33:01.800 --> 33:03.800
On Valentine's Day.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.720
Just before she died?

33:05.720 --> 33:08.240
Yeah, and I gave her the ring
to say sorry.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.240
Uh-huh.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.680
ALI: I wanted to know,
I still want to know,

33:10.680 --> 33:12.320
where it is,
because it's not at the house.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.640
My God. (LAUGHS)
That's what you were looking for?

33:14.640 --> 33:16.840
ALI: No - I was...
That's what I...I saw you...

33:16.840 --> 33:19.120
Listen - if she still has it...
..digging through my sister's stuff.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.880
..on her hand,
it means she forgave me!

33:20.880 --> 33:23.400
(PANTS)
For what?

33:23.400 --> 33:25.640
For screaming at her,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.520
at each other.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.480
She was so worked up.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.400
She was trying to contact you guys.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.400
Ah. (LAUGHS) This isn't about us.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.800
You were screaming at my sister
before she died.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.160
Would you...would you help me? Look.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.480
Could you ask them,
the coroner or whatever?

33:39.480 --> 33:41.600
I'm not going back to the body
for you.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.400
Well, can I get access?

33:45.400 --> 33:47.280
To Sarah?

33:47.280 --> 33:49.160
What, so you can...

33:49.160 --> 33:51.160
..pawn some ring?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.760
God, what do you think of me?!

33:52.760 --> 33:55.520
Don't come, to the funeral.

33:58.600 --> 33:59.600
(SIGHS)

34:05.040 --> 34:07.280
WOMAN: Lovely home.
YOUNGER WOMAN: Very.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.720
A real fixer-upperer.

34:09.720 --> 34:11.840
Yeah, you'll do very well with it.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.200
WOMAN: We're a family business.

34:14.200 --> 34:17.480
This is my daughter, Antonia.
She'll be leading today.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.240
ANTONIA: There are lots of options.

34:20.240 --> 34:22.600
I can talk you through our packages.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.080
(LAUGHS) Does the coffin matter?

34:31.080 --> 34:33.120
Let's...talk about Sarah.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.840
HANNA: Yes. It's just because
she's going to be cremated.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.000
Oh. Uh, just turn over.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.520
Um, a beautiful range of urns
as well.

34:40.520 --> 34:45.200
Her ashes, uh, are gonna be here,
buried at home. That's what we want.

34:45.200 --> 34:47.440
But we needn't decide all that now.
Do we?

34:47.440 --> 34:50.840
HANNA: Well, like,
why can't they be here, at home?

34:50.840 --> 34:52.880
We are always gonna have this house.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.080
CLAIRE: Well...

34:54.080 --> 34:57.800
It's just that your mum, um, borrowed
some money against this house,

34:57.800 --> 35:00.080
and construction's not cheap, so...

35:00.080 --> 35:01.160
..we don't know.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.360
Well, how much do we need?
Well...

35:03.360 --> 35:05.800
Sorry, but we can discuss all that
later, like, after the funeral.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.720
Or not withhold things.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.320
Let's discuss the service.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.200
You were thinking a chapel?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.440
It's a requiem in, uh...
in our parish church.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.840
We didn't discuss a mass.
Our sister deserves it.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.840
She was all into crystals and stuff,
wasn't she?

35:18.840 --> 35:20.920
CLAIRE: Yeah, exactly. Den's right.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.400
She was...
It's our family parish.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.040
You were baptised there.
I was married there.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.760
What do you guys think?

35:26.760 --> 35:28.760
URSULA: It's the church
she was confirmed in!

35:28.760 --> 35:30.160
I mean, you too, Den.
DEN: I know that.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.000
Sorry - she just...

35:32.000 --> 35:34.160
..asked us what WE think.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.520
Ciaran?

35:38.920 --> 35:40.840
What about Boora Point?

35:40.840 --> 35:42.480
For the funeral?

35:43.480 --> 35:44.880
It's where she ended up.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.880
HANNA: What?

35:45.880 --> 35:47.440
It's not a very practical idea,
Ciaran.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.360
Scattering her in the ocean
could be very beautiful.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.480
She drowned.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.000
Erm...
Of course.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.080
Take some time.

35:57.120 --> 36:01.240
Sarah's funeral is for you too.

36:01.240 --> 36:05.160
How can we help you prepare you

36:05.160 --> 36:07.800
for the road ahead?

36:07.800 --> 36:10.080
You take it step by step.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.000
You just go...

36:12.000 --> 36:13.240
..task by task.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.120
It's the only way.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.960
Right now, it's about...

36:17.960 --> 36:19.920
..the sandwiches.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.280
How many on a platter?

36:22.280 --> 36:25.720
Have a think about
the ratio of wholemeal bread.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.880
Or gluten-free is another thing.

36:27.880 --> 36:28.920
What's your favourite bread?

36:28.920 --> 36:32.040
Oh, I'm...
I like the cheap fluffy white stuff.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.360
URSULA: You know, people really like
the fibre of wholemeal.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.640
It's funny, 'cause, um...
CLAIRE: There used to be the... Oh.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.160
Sorry. Sorry.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.480
I used to hate lunches here
at first,

36:41.480 --> 36:43.600
when I first came to Australia.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.440
Needn't only be sandwiches,
though, does it?

36:45.440 --> 36:47.200
CLAIRE:
You grew to love them, didn't you?

36:47.200 --> 36:48.200
DEN: Not entirely.

36:48.200 --> 36:51.480
There was a little, uh,
pastry-filled hors d'oeuvre with...

36:51.480 --> 36:52.480
..what is it?

36:52.480 --> 36:53.960
You...you could use, um,

36:53.960 --> 36:56.520
uh, tinned crab or...
or, uh, uh, tuna.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.480
Vol-au-vents.
You're talking about vol-au-vents.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.160
ANTONIA: Vol-au-vents is something
our caterer can probably do.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.320
Uh, and the sandwiches, um,

37:03.320 --> 37:06.840
th...they usually
don't have enough margarine, so...

37:06.840 --> 37:09.520
..and...and the crusts off, right?

37:09.520 --> 37:11.000
WAYNE: Do you know what,
I was just thinking,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.800
we haven't seen
bacon puff pinwheels in a bit.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.360
SCOTT: Yeah.
WAYNE: That could be good.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.960
No, that is a top idea, Wayne.
URSULA: Mmm.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.880
Uh, I love that.

37:19.880 --> 37:21.800
That's cold or hot, a pinwheel?

37:21.800 --> 37:24.080
SCOTT: It's either.
URSULA: Oh. OK.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.160
ANTONIA: Yeah, yeah.
URSULA: Check out the Danishes.

37:26.160 --> 37:29.360
Yeah. We'd love that.
Apple.

37:54.920 --> 37:57.680
Hey.
Hey.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.640
Um...

37:59.640 --> 38:01.200
..we cool?

38:01.200 --> 38:03.240
I was a bit of a prick.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.240
Been a bit of shit going down.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.760
I was probably
a bit of a prick as well.

38:12.200 --> 38:14.040
You, um...

38:15.400 --> 38:18.880
..came to me for help, and, um...

38:18.880 --> 38:22.840
..now I'm sort of struggling bad
because...

38:22.840 --> 38:24.720
Something happen?

38:24.720 --> 38:26.120
They, um...

38:26.120 --> 38:28.440
..uh, found my mum's body.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.440
Shit.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.320
I really want to go out there,
to the spot.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.080
JAKE: W...why?

38:40.080 --> 38:42.200
CIARAN: Don't know.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.000
Just...

38:44.000 --> 38:46.080
..it's where she ended up.

38:48.440 --> 38:52.000
There should be, like, a marker or,
like...like, a big stone monument,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.840
but it's water, so I just...

38:55.960 --> 38:58.160
I just want to see it.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.080
But not on my own.

39:01.680 --> 39:04.200
You want me to come?

39:04.200 --> 39:05.760
Maybe.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.000
Yes.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.960
Would you?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.840
Oh, I don't know, man.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.200
How?

39:34.840 --> 39:37.520
Come on.
No-one locks their boats round here.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.640
Ciaran?

41:11.240 --> 41:12.480
CIARAN: Let's drop anchor here.

41:31.600 --> 41:36.000
Did they say it was an accident
that made her stay stuck under?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.720
CIARAN: An accident?

41:38.720 --> 41:40.320
It was deliberate.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.800
You know the posters we put up?

41:42.800 --> 41:45.240
Someone took 'em all down.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.400
All of them?

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
CIARAN: Every single one.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.280
Had to be the same person
who tipped off the cops.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.360
JAKE: Bloody arsehole.

41:58.960 --> 42:02.360
Well, at least they told the cops,
you know.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.320
'Cause if they hadn't, then...

42:04.320 --> 42:06.280
They could have said ages ago.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.880
Maybe they're just trying to own up.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.400
But they're gutless, you know.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.680
Still.

42:16.040 --> 42:19.520
You know, 'cause it...
it probably was an accident.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.560
Just got caught up
in the anchor or, um...

42:31.480 --> 42:32.720
Why'd you say that?

42:32.720 --> 42:34.800
JAKE: Eh?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.480
Say...say what?

42:39.000 --> 42:41.440
How did you know it was an anchor?

42:41.440 --> 42:42.800
JAKE: Oh.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.800
'Cause, uh, um...

42:43.800 --> 42:46.840
..you said it was a...
it was an anchor.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.600
You were talking about, uh, some...

42:50.600 --> 42:52.520
..anchor.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.080
Yeah, I must have.

Um...

43:12.880 --> 43:14.240
..what'd you do that for?

43:14.240 --> 43:16.720
Not for the cops,
if that's what you're worried about.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.200
(PHONE ALERT CHIMES)

43:34.080 --> 43:35.640
So...

43:37.520 --> 43:39.120
..this is where it happened.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.440
Where they found my mum...

43:44.720 --> 43:47.760
..caught up in an anchor.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.040
Hey.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.120
I need your help.
Why?

43:55.120 --> 43:56.200
Uh...
What's wrong?

43:56.200 --> 43:58.360
I just...I need to borrow, like,
a board or something, 'cause...

43:58.360 --> 43:59.360
GEORGE: But why?

43:59.360 --> 44:00.480
Um...

44:00.480 --> 44:01.480
..it's Ciaran.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.840
He's just, like...he's gone out
on the water, and he...

44:03.840 --> 44:04.840
..and I have to go out there.

44:04.840 --> 44:06.480
Well, no, you...well, you can't.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.840
It's not safe.
He's gonna do something really bad.

44:08.840 --> 44:11.240
Uh, uh...where is he, Hanna?
HANNA: He's at Boora Point.

44:14.120 --> 44:15.480
Somebody...

44:17.640 --> 44:20.040
..knew where she was,

44:20.040 --> 44:23.080
for weeks,
but left her in the water to rot.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.760
Whoever it is...

44:28.400 --> 44:30.040
..they deserve to suffer.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.880
Suffer the way
they made my whole family suffer.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.760
What the fuck, Ciaran?

44:39.760 --> 44:40.960
You gonna tell me what you did?

44:43.240 --> 44:45.280
Let's just go back, eh?

with you, Georgia?

can be made.
