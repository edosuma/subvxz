WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:02.959
Last time on Naomi...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.308
Someone stole the disc.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.875
<i>Everything that happened</i> <i>
at STAR Labs,</i>

00:05.918 --> 00:07.703
<i>it's all getting</i> <i>
really dangerous.</i>

00:07.746 --> 00:09.574
Awesome!

00:09.618 --> 00:11.881
What the hell is Dilustel?

00:11.924 --> 00:13.752
Naomi, I don't feel so good.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.537
Using Dr. Bell's technology.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.886
<i>Then if we</i> <i>
use the transmitter...</i>

00:16.929 --> 00:18.322
...we can track aliens.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.758
They found your birth rock.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.369
<i>But, I think Commander Steel</i>

00:21.412 --> 00:23.501
<i>is starting to suspect</i> <i>
I'm hiding something.</i>

00:23.545 --> 00:26.243
I was able to pinpoint
the extraterrestrial activity.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.853
The alien we're looking for

00:27.897 --> 00:29.377
is here at the party.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.340
<i>Patient is</i> <i>
responsive. Negative PLR.</i>

00:36.384 --> 00:39.256
<i>BP 110 over 60,</i> <i>
pulse strong but erratic.</i>

00:39.300 --> 00:40.692
<i>We're ten out. Over.</i>

00:49.397 --> 00:51.486
<i>Are there aliens</i> <i>
in Port Oswego?</i>

00:52.574 --> 00:53.444
No.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.360
I was going to say,
"Definitely not."

00:56.404 --> 00:58.188
But, you can never be too sure.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.103
What do you mean?

01:00.147 --> 01:03.585
What happened tonight showed me
that everyone has secrets.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.717
Sometimes the people
you think you know the best

01:05.761 --> 01:07.937
are the ones you don't really
know at all.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.808
This has to be a mistake.

01:09.852 --> 01:11.941
Um, maybe the device is wrong.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.944
You really think there's an
alien here in my house
at this party?

01:14.987 --> 01:17.860
This is like <i>Crooked House</i> or <i>
The Incredible Theft.</i>

01:18.643 --> 01:20.906
Agatha Christie?

01:20.950 --> 01:23.083
She's like the J.K. Rowling
of crime fiction without
the offensive tweets.

01:23.126 --> 01:26.390
If this is true, this means
that someone has been
lying to me.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.218
It means that someone
is still lying to me.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.133
Maybe they don't know
they're an alien.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.222
You didn't know until Superman.

01:32.266 --> 01:35.399
Why would an alien
who didn't know they were
an alien steal the disc?

01:35.443 --> 01:37.445
They wouldn't.
It could be anyone.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.973
Seriously, babe?

01:44.016 --> 01:45.975
I wish I was an alien.
Literally, that's what
I wished for,

01:46.018 --> 01:48.282
for my eighth birthday.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.110
Besides, would I
really out myself?

01:50.153 --> 01:52.503
If I were a secret alien,
I would tell you immediately

01:52.547 --> 01:54.505
so we could be an iconic
superhero duo.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.333
Like the lady version
of Batman and Robin,

01:56.377 --> 01:58.292
but with powers.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.424
Whoever it is,
we need to find out
before the party is over.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.860
How are we supposed to do that?

02:08.519 --> 02:09.738
What's going on in here?

02:10.521 --> 02:13.611
Nothing.

02:13.655 --> 02:16.614
Naomi, I just came to tell you
that the champagne
has been poured.

02:16.658 --> 02:20.052
So now would be
the perfect time for anything
you might have planned.

02:21.532 --> 02:27.190
That rhymes with most or ghost?

02:27.234 --> 02:28.844
A roast? No way!

02:28.887 --> 02:31.020
You and Mr. M are
marriage goals to the extreme.

02:32.108 --> 02:33.979
- A toast...
- Oh!

02:34.023 --> 02:36.852
...like the one I've seen you
secretly working on for days?

02:36.895 --> 02:38.158
A toast! Right.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.029
Er, I'll be right there.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.038
- Nathan!
- Oh.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.518
I've been looking for you.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.084
Yeah, I was just about
to go do the toast.

02:52.128 --> 02:53.173
What are you guys
doing in there?

02:53.216 --> 02:54.217
Nothing.

02:57.742 --> 02:58.700
You know I love that.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.354
I know.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.662
<i>Twenty years</i> <i>
is a long time.</i>

03:04.706 --> 03:08.492
I'm lucky to have known
my parents for 16 of them.

03:08.536 --> 03:09.885
They are the best parents
in the world.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.322
Although, I might be biased.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.327
What's the secret
to a happy marriage?

03:17.371 --> 03:20.461
I think it's... trust.

03:21.723 --> 03:23.942
I'm pretty sure my parents

03:23.986 --> 03:26.336
always tell each other
the truth,

03:26.380 --> 03:29.034
even when
those truths are painful.

03:29.078 --> 03:32.081
Like when one person
always overcooks the chicken.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.782
Or the other always insists
on playing Coldplay

03:37.826 --> 03:40.220
literally any time
we're in the car.

03:44.746 --> 03:48.489
I want to thank all of you
for coming out tonight.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.275
I love you so much,
Mom and Dad.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.978
To Greg and Jen!

04:09.336 --> 04:12.252
<i>You really think</i> <i>
there's an alien here,</i> <i>
in my house, at this party?</i>

04:14.297 --> 04:15.167
<i>It could be anyone.</i>

04:37.886 --> 04:39.757
I totally stan the McDuffies.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.499
Their anniversary
felt like my anniversary.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.632
Is that weird?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.634
I'd say the party
was pretty normal.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.114
Um, except for the snacks.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.768
A lot of weird cheeses.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.336
I didn't see Naomi much
after her speech,

04:53.380 --> 04:55.295
but she seemed normal.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.209
Totally normal.

04:57.253 --> 04:59.211
If Naomi have been dealing with
something I would have known.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.823
Like I said, BFF.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.128
There are at least
40 people here.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.608
That's a lot of suspects.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.436
The Internet
has a ton of great ideas

05:06.480 --> 05:08.830
about how to identify one.

05:08.873 --> 05:12.181
"Aliens might use
outrageous physical accents
to hide in plain sight."

05:14.226 --> 05:16.141
Why does Lourdes
have purple hair?

05:16.185 --> 05:17.665
Come on, we were all
thinking it.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.667
Whoever's on my street
that night took the disc.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.496
We need to check alibis.

05:22.539 --> 05:25.412
But, it's not like
we can just go around
and ask people.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.285
Maybe we don't need to ask

05:30.939 --> 05:33.158
but, you already had
my social media handle.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.857
Mine too. soccerislife.believe.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.077
What? <i>Ted Lasso</i> is dope.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.036
These photos are for
an online party album.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.472
It's a different thing.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.737
Thanks.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.827
Jacob, is it working?

05:49.871 --> 05:52.700
Yep.
It's coming through right now.

05:52.743 --> 05:55.093
Wow. I like pasta
as much as the next guy,

05:55.137 --> 05:57.400
but does a meatball
really need a close up?

05:57.444 --> 05:59.924
Once we get the exif data,
you should be able

05:59.968 --> 06:02.187
<i>to triangulate everyone's</i> <i>
location to see who's on my</i> <i>
street that night.</i>

06:02.231 --> 06:04.364
I feel like
James Bond right now.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.930
Actually, hon,
you're more like Q.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.497
But, he's the real hero anyway.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.369
Mrs. Lipschitz, hi!

06:09.412 --> 06:11.501
I was just wondering
if you were on any
social media?

06:11.545 --> 06:14.939
- Instagram, Twitter--
- Is that about birds?

06:14.983 --> 06:15.810
Sometimes.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.422
My daughter's on the TikTok.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.903
That's great,
but it's just TikTok.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.687
There's no "just"
about it.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.733
She says that the TikTok
is a very big deal.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.966
No one's supposed to be
in here.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.229
Can I help you with something?

06:44.273 --> 06:47.494
Yeah, I'm in the market
for a tattoo, but no one
was upstairs.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.890
Nice place.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.066
I've been thinking about doing
some training myself.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.416
I'm sorry. It's a private gym.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.855
There sure are
a lot of weapons.

07:04.119 --> 07:07.122
I'm just wrapping up a session.

07:07.165 --> 07:11.431
I'm happy to take you upstairs
and show you
some of my designs...

07:11.474 --> 07:12.606
for your tattoo.

07:13.781 --> 07:14.651
I'm in no rush.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.003
How long have you lived
in Port Oswego?

07:19.047 --> 07:21.658
Twenty years, almost.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.355
That's a long time.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.401
You must know the people
in this town pretty well then.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.143
Some more than others.

07:34.802 --> 07:35.890
I try to keep to myself.

07:41.504 --> 07:44.899
I don't mean to be rude,
but I should get back
to my training.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.249
Of course.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.470
I'll give that
tattoo some thought.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.219
So that's everyone.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.529
Except for my mom's co-worker
Craig, who told me he prefers

08:06.573 --> 08:08.357
to live off the grid.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.664
He was actually camping at
Crater Lake until last night.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.796
Craig's off the hook.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.363
How many people were
on my block the night
the disc was stolen?

08:18.541 --> 08:19.629
Uh-oh.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.196
Uh-oh?
What do you mean "Uh-oh?"

08:22.458 --> 08:24.155
No way. That can't be right.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.636
There were three people
on Naomi's block that night,

08:26.680 --> 08:29.378
which means we have
three suspects.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.512
Nathan, Anthony and Lourdes.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.565
"Did anything unusual
happen at the party?"

08:44.611 --> 08:48.266
Not really. It was all like
pretty standard stuff.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.923
It's not Nathan,
Lourdes or Anthony.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.535
They're our friends.
Nathan's my boyfriend.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.711
Boyfriend? When did
that become official?

08:57.754 --> 08:58.712
Last night.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.191
Last night?

09:00.235 --> 09:02.890
As in a full 24 hours ago?
Unacceptable.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.935
It's not a big deal.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.764
A relationship status change
is number one on
the list of reasons

09:07.808 --> 09:10.071
to call your BFF immediately.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.596
I know. I'm sorry.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.860
Do you guys really think
that one of our friends
is a secret alien?

09:16.904 --> 09:18.601
We have to at least
consider it.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.864
They were in your neighborhood.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.692
Plus, they knew about the disc.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.868
Well, it's definitely
not Anthony.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.696
He reacted to the Dilustel
at camp.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.306
What's Dilustel?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.439
It's basically an alien crystal
that makes anyone

09:30.482 --> 09:31.962
who's not an alien
lose their minds.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.965
If we're going to investigate,

09:35.009 --> 09:37.620
we need to do it
without letting them know
that we're investigating.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.448
Look at you thinking
like the Queen of Crime.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.407
Agatha?

09:42.451 --> 09:43.887
Yes, some of her tropes
don't hold up that well.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.150
But, the woman published
like a million books.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.936
I wish we had a polygraph.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.898
Maybe we don't need
a polygraph.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.771
Polygraphs, they track your
physiological change, right?

09:57.814 --> 10:01.339
Your blood pressure,
your perspiration,
your heart rate.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.732
I have superhearing.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.342
I can tell if
their heart speeds up.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.301
Babe, you're a human
lie detector.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.955
That's... that's very cool.

10:07.998 --> 10:11.001
But, how are we supposed
to ask them questions?

10:12.481 --> 10:13.613
Maybe it's time for
a party game.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.188
Thanks for coming.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.189
You said it was urgent.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.845
An undercover military officer

10:29.585 --> 10:31.631
paid me a visit.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.806
Do you think you've been
compromised?

10:32.849 --> 10:34.111
It might be worse than that.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.460
I looked into the man.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.071
His name is
Commander Henry Steel.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.640
He works with Greg McDuffie.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.558
If Greg had known
Steel was coming,

10:46.602 --> 10:47.864
he would have warned you.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.388
What else does Greg not know?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.217
That's not our only problem.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.133
Naomi called.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.135
Someone stole her disc.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.398
Who would have stolen it?

11:00.442 --> 11:04.315
She believes there might be
another being like us
here in Port Oswego.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.013
At her parents'
anniversary party.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.799
I haven't sensed anyone new.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.497
There are beings
without abilities.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.412
We need to deal with
this military situation.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.981
It's too dangerous
to call Greg.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.069
We don't know who's listening.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.551
We need to talk...

11:23.770 --> 11:25.380
- face to face.
- Whoa, whoa.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.860
So you want to go
to their party?

11:27.599 --> 11:28.600
Yes.

11:30.472 --> 11:31.560
Dressed like that?

11:32.387 --> 11:34.432
Is there a problem?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.478
Do you own anything
else that's not black?

11:38.262 --> 11:39.655
This is charcoal.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.370
Dee, the suit is dope.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.764
Hmm. What does that mean?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.723
That means you look good
for a change.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.595
Is that a pocket square?

12:06.638 --> 12:07.944
You need to stop fidgeting.

12:09.293 --> 12:13.080
This suit is tight.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.865
Naomi, you should have
told us about the disc
right when it happened.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.388
I know. I'm sorry.

12:17.432 --> 12:20.565
I thought you'd be upset.

12:20.609 --> 12:24.395
Or maybe overreact
and show up to
a party uninvited.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.309
That's not why we're here.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.965
We have more pressing concerns.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.185
More pressing concerns
than a potential alien
at this party?

12:33.100 --> 12:36.320
It's about, uh... the military.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.322
The military?

12:38.366 --> 12:39.976
Don't worry,
we'll handle it.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.282
We need to speak
to your parents.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.632
I think they're in the kitchen.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.422
Naomi, if there's
an alien at this party,

12:51.466 --> 12:54.121
you should consider why
they may want to stay hidden.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.993
What do you mean?

12:57.037 --> 12:58.516
Some secrets
are better off buried.

13:01.868 --> 13:02.782
<i>Tell us</i> <i>
about the party.</i>

13:04.131 --> 13:06.786
It was pretty tame.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.440
Greg and I were
more adventurous
in our younger days.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.702
This party was uneventful.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.494
That's a nice suit, Dee.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.104
What are you doing here?

13:21.148 --> 13:23.367
Your boss, Commander Steel,
paid me a visit tonight.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.500
That's not good, Greg.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.024
Dee was involved
with the Superman incident.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.026
I didn't know Steele
was still looking into it.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.463
Why would Steel suddenly
stop trusting you?

13:32.507 --> 13:33.856
I have no idea.

13:33.900 --> 13:34.814
Nothing's changed.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.731
- Unless...
- No, we were careful.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.211
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.517
Thanks for telling us.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.648
We'll handle it from here.

13:43.692 --> 13:44.998
Who's really in danger here?

13:46.173 --> 13:47.174
You need to tell us the truth.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.963
He's right, Greg.
They're a part of this.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.356
Whether we like it or not.

14:00.927 --> 14:04.365
Steel found Naomi's birth rock.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.497
We fabricated the results
of the analysis.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.411
We were careful.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.893
But, maybe we
weren't careful enough.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.504
So Naomi is in danger.

14:13.548 --> 14:14.984
We don't know that for sure.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.333
You should have told us.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.335
We don't have
to tell you anything.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.946
You do when it comes to Naomi.

14:22.818 --> 14:26.039
I think
he's starting to suspect

14:26.082 --> 14:27.997
I'm sympathetic to aliens.

14:35.222 --> 14:38.268
We need to find out
what he knows.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.749
We'd have to access
the files in his office.

14:43.230 --> 14:46.929
Jen, it's time.

14:46.973 --> 14:47.930
Time for what?

14:50.759 --> 14:52.108
We have a contingency plan.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.284
But, it's risky.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.808
If Naomi is in danger,
do we have a choice?

15:00.334 --> 15:02.249
We have a way
to access Steel's computer.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.208
But, I can't go.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.645
Neither can you.
Steel is watching us.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.910
I'll do it.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.998
I have access to the base.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.436
Then I'll come with you.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.438
If something goes wrong,
you'll need backup.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.747
<i>I always respected</i> <i>
Commander Steel.</i>

15:22.791 --> 15:24.358
That's why this is all so hard.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.405
But, you asked about
my daughter, um...

15:28.449 --> 15:30.320
I'm sure they were bored.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.235
<i>This wasn't really</i> <i>
a teenage party,</i>

15:32.279 --> 15:34.237
<i>but they made the best of it.</i>

15:34.281 --> 15:39.503
Welcome to
Never Have I Ever:
Anniversary Edition.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.244
The rules are simple.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.985
If you've never done it before,
you put a finger down.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.422
Like, for example, never have I
ever broken a bone.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.858
If you've broken a bone,
you put a finger down.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.776
How exactly
do you win this game?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.953
By exposing people's secrets.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.650
Like, never have I ever

15:55.693 --> 15:57.782
scored the winning goal
in a soccer game...

15:57.826 --> 15:59.088
at Homecoming.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.524
That was really specific, dude.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.483
He's using a complex strategy.

16:02.526 --> 16:06.443
Never have I ever
worked part time at
my dad's logging company.

16:06.487 --> 16:10.143
Never have I ever banned
a customer for
"disrespecting a comic."

16:11.709 --> 16:14.495
Never have I ever gotten
a B + in a report card.

16:17.324 --> 16:21.415
Never have I ever gone
to more than two parties
in one night.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.896
Three parties in one night.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.637
Four parties in one night?

16:26.681 --> 16:28.857
Legend!

16:28.900 --> 16:32.556
Never have I ever taken
something from someone
I care about.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.996
Never have I ever broken
into someone's house.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.911
Never have I ever
been on Naomi's street
without telling her.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.001
Especially not
three nights ago.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.307
Okay, what's with
these questions?

16:44.351 --> 16:47.484
I've been pet-sitting
for the Millers for
the past couple of days.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.051
They live on this block.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.314
This game isn't very fun.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.925
Why were you on my street?

16:53.969 --> 16:57.016
No offense, but it's not really
any of your business.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.756
It has nothing to do with you.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.023
Seriously?

17:04.066 --> 17:07.591
One of my teammates
lives in your neighborhood.

17:07.635 --> 17:09.637
I left my cleats in his car
and went to get them.

17:10.551 --> 17:11.682
That's it?

17:11.726 --> 17:13.336
That's it.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.210
Who's ready
for Truth or Dare?

17:22.780 --> 17:25.522
Were you
with Naomi and Nathan
at the party?

17:25.566 --> 17:27.176
Yeah, I hung out
with them at the party,

17:27.220 --> 17:28.960
but they weren't acting weird.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.962
Everything seemed
just totally fine.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.449
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

17:40.407 --> 17:42.974
I'm sorry about the game.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.542
It kind of felt like
an interrogation.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.416
I know.
I'm just a little on edge.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.768
Some weird stuff
has been happening lately.

17:54.769 --> 17:55.987
Weirder than usual?

17:58.860 --> 18:03.169
It's like, people being
in places that they're
not supposed to be.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.085
Things are going missing.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.043
And you think I have something
to do with all that?

18:11.829 --> 18:13.092
Wow.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.398
You didn't text me
back last night.

18:15.442 --> 18:18.488
I told you,
I had a late practice.

18:21.970 --> 18:22.971
Hey. What's going on with you?

18:23.841 --> 18:24.799
You okay?

18:30.283 --> 18:31.719
You know you can
be honest with me, right?

18:32.720 --> 18:33.634
About anything.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.247
Yeah, I know that.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.076
And if you're keeping
some kind of a secret,

18:42.164 --> 18:43.296
you can tell me,

18:45.080 --> 18:46.125
even if it's hard.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.389
Everyone has secrets.

18:53.175 --> 18:57.136
It's important that we're
honest with each other,

18:57.179 --> 18:59.138
That's what I love
about our relationship.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.270
And so do I.

19:01.314 --> 19:04.273
But, can you really say that
you're always honest with me?

19:04.317 --> 19:05.622
What are you talking about?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.885
Like tonight.

19:07.929 --> 19:11.324
You and Annabelle and Jacob
have spent half the party
locked away in your room.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.153
There's obviously
something going on.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.241
But, you don't want to
loop me in.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.766
Trust is a two-way street.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.596
Is there something
you want to tell me?

19:29.516 --> 19:30.517
Okay.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.347
I'm gonna
get some punch.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.880
Nathan. Naomi's boyfriend.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.361
I think.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.623
You are not sure?

19:51.059 --> 19:53.757
I am. I just haven't
gone to talk to her

19:53.801 --> 19:57.674
since it... happened.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.110
What about
at the party?

19:59.154 --> 20:00.938
How were things
between the two of you?

20:02.244 --> 20:03.245
<i>Everything was fine.</i>

20:14.909 --> 20:15.823
Where's your jacket?

20:18.086 --> 20:19.174
It was very uncomfortable.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.090
I'm surprised
you're still here.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.093
I'm mingling.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.660
Or you're keeping
an eye out for me?

20:35.277 --> 20:36.322
Thank you for staying.

20:39.325 --> 20:40.456
Are you okay?

20:44.504 --> 20:46.070
I don't know.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.290
I just really don't
want to believe

20:48.334 --> 20:51.772
that someone I care about
has been lying to me.

20:51.815 --> 20:52.860
Maybe they're not.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.690
Maybe this is all
a big misunderstanding.

20:59.780 --> 21:00.694
Do you really believe that?

21:01.782 --> 21:03.000
What I do believe

21:04.132 --> 21:06.395
is that no matter what happens,

21:06.439 --> 21:08.354
you can't let it change
who you are.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.923
You're someone who believes
the best in people.

21:12.967 --> 21:15.012
Dee! That suit is tight.

21:16.144 --> 21:17.188
Yes, it is.

21:19.452 --> 21:22.498
Um... Jacob has something
to show us.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.593
<i>You said</i> <i>
you had a breakthrough?</i>

21:30.637 --> 21:33.335
I think I figured out a way
to identify the mystery alien.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.858
Oh.

21:34.902 --> 21:35.990
Don't you mean "yay"?

21:36.033 --> 21:38.558
Our prime suspect is Nathan.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.343
Oh.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.432
Babe, If Agatha Christie
has taught me anything,

21:43.476 --> 21:45.826
it's that you can never
rule out a last-minute twist.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.614
What did you find, Jacob?

21:51.658 --> 21:53.790
In Dr. Bell's research,
she hypothesized

21:53.834 --> 21:56.445
that aliens might
emit a unique energy

21:56.489 --> 21:58.142
that would distort photographs.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.623
Something to do with how
the eyes reflect the light.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.799
If viewed
with the right exposure,

22:02.843 --> 22:05.149
their eyes
would emit a blue glow.

22:05.193 --> 22:06.977
But, I have taken
a jillion photos of Naomi

22:07.021 --> 22:09.371
and her eyes have never
glowed an alien blue.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.069
I'm guessing
it's only film, not digital.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.028
And only if it's processed

22:14.071 --> 22:16.204
with a specific
chemical solution.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.467
Kind of like
what they use on slides.

22:18.511 --> 22:19.599
Where are we going to get that?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.342
The dark room at school.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.996
I can see if Lourdes
can give me a ride.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.172
Can you keep everyone
here till I get back?

22:28.216 --> 22:29.696
Mission most-definitely
accepted.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.267
Everybody knows photography
is a hobby of mine.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.182
So no, I wasn't surprised

22:38.226 --> 22:40.359
when Naomi asked me
to take photos at the party,

22:40.402 --> 22:43.362
but that kept me
busy all night.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.102
So no, I never saw
Commander Steel.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.758
Okay, can you get
a little closer together?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.239
One second.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.897
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.333
Hope I am not late
to the party.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.380
I'm looking for someone.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.298
Yeah. It was strange.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.127
The commander had never
set foot in my house before.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.739
But, then he just
showed up unannounced.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.610
He wasn't acting like himself.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.525
You sure
I can't get you anything?

23:16.569 --> 23:18.614
A beer?
We have a cheese board.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.095
No. I won't be staying long.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.316
So what brings you by, sir?

23:25.360 --> 23:28.624
Twenty years of marriage.
That's quite an accomplishment.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.454
Out of the billions
of people on this planet,

23:32.498 --> 23:34.238
you find each other.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.283
What are the odds?

23:36.850 --> 23:39.766
On top of that,
you found your daughter.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.464
We like to say she found us.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.596
We were lucky.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.469
Sounds like
more than just luck.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.428
Where did you
adopt her from again?

23:49.471 --> 23:50.951
The East Coast.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.909
It was a closed adoption,
so we don't know exactly.

23:52.953 --> 23:53.954
Right.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.654
Do you know,
there is many people

23:58.698 --> 24:01.483
that don't view aliens
as an imminent threat?

24:01.527 --> 24:03.485
Even people
in our own organization.

24:05.182 --> 24:06.662
That's the whole point
of the task force.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.838
Ostensibly, yes,

24:08.882 --> 24:12.755
but we have some
philosophical differences.

24:12.799 --> 24:15.366
The true aim
of the task force
is to defend.

24:16.890 --> 24:17.978
Mine is to eliminate.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.199
I am not sure I follow, sir.

24:22.243 --> 24:24.767
A lot of people refer to aliens
as innocuous.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.160
There is only one reason

24:26.203 --> 24:28.945
another race
would come to this planet.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.295
It's because
they want our resources.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.733
And I believe they will do
whatever it takes to get them.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.477
I know
what you are hiding, Major.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.960
Sir, with all due respect,
you have completely lost me--

24:44.004 --> 24:46.789
Have you ever
heard of STAR Labs?

24:46.833 --> 24:48.661
Turns out,
this was the missing piece

24:48.704 --> 24:50.576
to crack this whole
thing wide open.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.665
Now, I have proof.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.320
Proof of what?

24:56.364 --> 24:57.800
I've always
respected you, Major.

24:57.844 --> 24:58.845
So I am going
to give you the opportunity

24:58.888 --> 25:01.021
to turn yourself in.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.718
I can go through
the usual channels.

25:02.762 --> 25:03.937
I have enough evidence.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.506
All due respect,

25:07.549 --> 25:09.638
I think you've been putting in
too many late nights.

25:09.682 --> 25:10.857
You are not making sense.

25:11.858 --> 25:12.772
Isn't it strange?

25:14.382 --> 25:16.732
I haven't seen your wife
and daughter around at all.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.651
I have always respected
you too, Commander.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.827
Such a decorated career.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.568
So many years of work.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.874
I'd hate to see it ruined

25:27.917 --> 25:29.571
because you're grasping
at straws.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.140
Right.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.404
Okay, then.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.146
You have a good evening, Major.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.413
<i>Did you see</i> <i>
Commander Steel at the party?</i>

25:46.501 --> 25:48.459
Commander Steel?

25:48.503 --> 25:51.027
No, I didn't see him
at the party.

25:51.071 --> 25:54.683
<i>But, Annabelle and I
were busy with party planning.</i>

25:54.727 --> 25:56.076
<i>We were in charge of games.</i>

25:59.514 --> 26:01.081
Oh, no. Did you see that?

26:02.604 --> 26:04.780
Mr. Davis taking
the last mini pizza?

26:05.781 --> 26:07.566
He made an enemy today.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.306
You know I usually support
your snack-based vendettas,

26:09.350 --> 26:10.917
but we don't have time
for that right now. Look!

26:13.615 --> 26:15.399
I think that was
a goodbye laugh.

26:15.443 --> 26:18.707
And that was definitely
a goodbye hug.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.275
We can't let them leave
before Naomi gets back.

26:21.318 --> 26:25.061
Or at least until Anthony
takes a picture of every guest.

26:26.454 --> 26:27.716
We are going
to be here for a while.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.239
Great party.
I'll see you kids Monday.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.763
Uh, no, you can't leave,

26:30.806 --> 26:33.417
because you don't want
to miss the main event.

26:33.461 --> 26:35.419
Uh, didn't they already
cut the cake?

26:35.463 --> 26:37.900
Uh, the other main event.

26:37.944 --> 26:39.293
It's a... It's a surprise,

26:39.336 --> 26:41.295
but we are mere
moments away. So...

26:44.298 --> 26:45.604
We're gonna need some help.

26:51.784 --> 26:52.611
Dee!

26:54.134 --> 26:55.222
Hi, again!

26:56.397 --> 26:57.659
What is the point of this food?

26:57.703 --> 27:00.270
It can't possibly
be sustenance.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.272
I blame the French.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.491
What happened
to your vest and jacket?

27:04.361 --> 27:05.928
It was restrictive.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.277
The high price of fashion.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.802
Mr. Dee, we need your help.

27:09.845 --> 27:11.673
Technically,
Naomi needs your help

27:11.717 --> 27:14.763
because there has been
a murder.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.156
What are you talking about?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.810
Oh, no! Sorry,
not a real one. Sorry.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.290
Jacob is just very excited.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.205
Naomi needs us
to keep everyone here.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.948
So we are doing
a murder mystery party game.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.211
One person secretly
plays a murderer

27:28.255 --> 27:29.691
and the rest of us
have to catch them

27:29.735 --> 27:31.345
before they "kill" again.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.696
Why is murder fun?

27:34.740 --> 27:36.785
I blame late-stage capitalism.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.178
Here is your character card.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.184
"B.L. Du-bois."

27:44.227 --> 27:45.054
Dubois.

27:46.055 --> 27:46.882
The butler.

27:49.406 --> 27:50.886
Do they not have those
on your planet?

27:50.930 --> 27:53.497
You must be the boyfriend.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.021
I'm sorry, Dee.
It's... it's a long story,

27:55.064 --> 27:56.370
but you are going
to have a lot of fun.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.590
Um, fun fact,

27:59.634 --> 28:01.027
all throughout
the Agatha Christie
detective novels,

28:01.070 --> 28:03.072
the butler is never
the one who did it.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.987
So you are probably
not the killer.

28:05.031 --> 28:07.511
Not because you look
like the killer.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.818
I mean, you kind of do,
you know,
because you are the...

28:09.862 --> 28:11.167
You have those tattoos

28:11.211 --> 28:14.823
and face is very
broody and scary, but...

28:14.867 --> 28:16.042
Good luck! Rooting for you!

28:18.305 --> 28:19.567
I'm the butler.

28:21.787 --> 28:22.788
Thanks again for the ride.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.181
No problem.

28:25.225 --> 28:26.617
It's been a while
since I was in this school.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.532
What are we looking for again?

28:28.576 --> 28:32.058
A solution
of potassium hydroquinone
monosulfate phenidone.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.757
Here, I'll help you.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.079
So, what got stolen?

28:54.428 --> 28:56.125
Hmm?

28:56.169 --> 28:59.302
Your questions during the game
weren't exactly subtle.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.914
Someone stuck
into my house
and stole the disc.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.703
And you thought
that someone was me?

29:09.922 --> 29:11.793
I didn't know what to think.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.275
I have just been off lately.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.801
Do you ever feel like

29:19.845 --> 29:22.021
maybe you don't know people
as well as you think you do?

29:23.457 --> 29:25.241
All the time.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.591
Because you never do know
people as well as you think.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.419
Isn't that kind of cynical?

29:29.463 --> 29:30.943
Actually, I find it freeing.

29:33.119 --> 29:34.816
People will never live up
to your expectations,

29:34.860 --> 29:36.600
and the sooner
you can accept that,

29:36.644 --> 29:38.646
the sooner you can accept
people for who they really are.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.476
Does that mean
you are not going to tell me

29:42.519 --> 29:43.564
why you were on my street?

29:45.392 --> 29:49.613
No. I told you, it's personal.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.180
It's not like you tell me
everything, either.

29:52.703 --> 29:53.792
What are you talking about?

29:55.663 --> 29:57.796
There's something
going on with you.

29:57.839 --> 29:58.927
There has been for a while.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.973
There is nothing
going on with me.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.498
It's fine that
you don't want to tell me.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.542
That's the point.

30:07.153 --> 30:09.982
Just know that if you ever
do want to talk about it,

30:11.026 --> 30:12.158
I'm here.

30:20.688 --> 30:21.515
I found it.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.822
Naomi?

30:23.865 --> 30:25.998
No, I didn't see her
leave the party.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.347
I wasn't there either.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.523
We were out of ice,
so I ran out.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.571
So that's the contingency plan.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.486
Greg and I
needed to be prepared.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.010
What exactly is
on that hard drive?

30:39.446 --> 30:40.403
Access codes.

30:41.622 --> 30:42.753
Among other things.

30:44.712 --> 30:46.627
If you want
to say something,
you should just say it.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.851
You should have stayed
away from Naomi.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.678
If you had,
maybe none of this
would have happened.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.550
- It wouldn't have mattered.
- You don't know that.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.509
Naomi needed to know the truth
about her destiny. It was time.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.076
You don't get to decide that.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.862
She's not your daughter.
She's mine.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.254
And she is only 16 years old.

31:05.298 --> 31:06.690
She is not ready
for any of this.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.562
She is more ready
than you think, Jennifer.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.216
It wasn't your call.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.000
I have been quiet
for a long time.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.523
Maybe too long.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.699
But, still I haven't
told her everything.

31:15.743 --> 31:16.875
I have honor.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.267
What is that supposed to mean?

31:18.311 --> 31:19.138
Who the hell are you?

31:23.403 --> 31:24.404
You need to hurry.

31:29.844 --> 31:30.889
Oh, no!

31:31.933 --> 31:33.239
What did you find?

31:33.282 --> 31:35.023
Steel has been tracking
me and Greg.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.590
He knows you've been
hiding something.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.072
Not just us.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.554
He knows about Naomi.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.438
"Why was I at school?"

31:59.613 --> 32:01.963
I forgot my book in my locker.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.617
Must have been
pretty important for you

32:03.660 --> 32:05.140
to leave the party.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.055
I have a calc test tomorrow.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.578
And once you got to the school,

32:08.622 --> 32:09.840
you went straight
to your locker?

32:10.667 --> 32:11.494
That's right.

32:18.458 --> 32:20.068
There's someone here.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.027
It would be really ironic
if I got murdered at school.

32:33.038 --> 32:33.995
Nathan?

32:34.039 --> 32:35.823
What's he doing here?

32:36.563 --> 32:37.694
I have no idea.

32:39.827 --> 32:40.959
Can... Can I meet you
at the van?

32:41.002 --> 32:42.743
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.140
And then I went
back to the van.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.837
So
you weren't in the building

32:49.880 --> 32:50.969
when the incident happened?

32:51.839 --> 32:53.623
No.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.930
<i>I didn't see Naomi or Nathan</i> <i>
until after it was over.</i>

33:12.338 --> 33:13.992
Nathan.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.342
Naomi. Uh,
what are you doing here?

33:16.385 --> 33:18.213
No. What are you doing here?

33:18.257 --> 33:19.693
I was just--

33:19.736 --> 33:21.738
Looks like you were
breaking into my locker.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.045
Hold up. Did you
follow me here?

33:24.089 --> 33:27.309
No.
Maybe I should have.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.181
What's going on
with you tonight?

33:29.224 --> 33:30.660
You are acting really weird.

33:30.704 --> 33:33.185
What's going on with me?
I am acting weird?

33:33.228 --> 33:35.578
You are the one
breaking into my locker.

33:35.622 --> 33:37.015
What? Breaking in--

33:37.058 --> 33:37.885
Is the disc in there?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.671
The disc?
Why would I have that?

33:41.715 --> 33:43.369
Someone stole it from my room.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.849
And you think I stole it?
Is that what this is all about?

33:45.893 --> 33:47.721
You were on my street
three nights ago,

33:47.764 --> 33:49.766
and I know you are not
telling me the truth about why.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.856
You're right.

33:52.900 --> 33:53.727
I have been lying.

33:54.815 --> 33:55.642
About this.

34:11.266 --> 34:12.354
Nathan. I--

34:12.398 --> 34:13.877
I missed your call last night

34:13.921 --> 34:15.618
because I was getting
these photos printed.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.925
And yeah,
I was at your house
without telling you.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.189
Couldn't remember
your favorite flowers,

34:21.233 --> 34:22.799
but I know your mom
has some planted,

34:22.843 --> 34:25.324
so I figured I could show
a picture to the florist.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.284
I don't know what to say.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.595
- Nathan, I am so--
- No.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.684
Don't do that.

34:42.863 --> 34:43.777
<i>I was upset.</i>

34:46.345 --> 34:47.259
But, I shouldn't have left.

34:50.436 --> 34:53.917
If I had stayed,
I could have helped her.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.963
I would have been there
for her when...

35:01.838 --> 35:02.796
But, I wasn't.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.279
I left her at the school.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.064
<i>Alone.</i>

35:16.026 --> 35:16.853
Hello, Naomi.

35:18.855 --> 35:21.162
My name is Commander Steel.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.468
We have a lot to talk about.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.348
Do you know who I am, Naomi?

35:34.567 --> 35:36.134
You work with my dad.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.179
That's right.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.487
No disrespect,
but what are you doing here?

35:42.488 --> 35:44.142
I think you know why I'm here.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.449
I should call my parents.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.669
Except they're not really
your parents, are they?

35:51.845 --> 35:54.413
- You're adopted.
- Yes.

35:55.501 --> 35:56.719
But, adopted from where?

35:58.025 --> 35:59.157
Somewhere on the East Coast.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.029
Right. The East Coast.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.119
Or maybe
somewhere farther away.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.428
Do you believe that life
exists on other planets?

36:11.081 --> 36:13.171
I haven't really
thought about it.

36:13.214 --> 36:15.695
I don't like to refer
to these beings as aliens.

36:15.738 --> 36:18.045
It's become
too mainstream,
too innocuous.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.178
Because, really...

36:21.614 --> 36:23.093
they're a danger
to our way of life...

36:24.530 --> 36:25.966
our very existence.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.448
- I think I should go.
- I know who you are.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.408
What you are.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.236
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.067
This is called an S-RUD.

36:40.110 --> 36:42.548
We've been developing it
for some time.

36:42.591 --> 36:45.333
It's based on a concept
called resonance.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.553
It only reacts to beings
that aren't of this Earth.

36:48.554 --> 36:49.903
I'm told it's quite painful.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.386
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.041
<i>He was threatening me.</i>

36:58.085 --> 37:00.435
Do you
have any idea why?

37:00.479 --> 37:03.003
No. It seemed like
he was after me.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.092
Was it about my dad?

37:05.135 --> 37:06.441
We're not sure yet.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.399
What happened next?

37:08.661 --> 37:11.707
I was going to run,

37:11.751 --> 37:14.710
and then he just collapsed.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.146
It seemed like a heart attack,

37:16.190 --> 37:19.237
but I wasn't sure,
so I... I called my dad.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.981
Well, thank you
for taking the time

37:25.025 --> 37:26.592
to give us a statement,
Ms. McDuffie.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.902
Patient is
responsive Negative PLR.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.731
BP 110 over 60,
pulse strong but erratic.

37:35.775 --> 37:37.298
We're ten out. Over.

37:48.135 --> 37:51.747
We had no idea
Steel was capable
of this kind of behavior.

37:51.791 --> 37:55.098
And it seems
that this was just
the tip of the iceberg.

37:55.142 --> 37:56.839
What do you mean?

37:56.883 --> 37:58.276
We found this on his computer.

38:00.713 --> 38:03.629
It appears that Steel
has had an obsession
with extraterrestrials

38:03.672 --> 38:05.457
for quite some time now.

38:08.721 --> 38:11.593
I was part of the task force.
I never suspected

38:11.637 --> 38:13.856
that Steel had some
kind of alternative agenda

38:13.900 --> 38:15.510
and would go rogue.

38:15.554 --> 38:17.599
We're not sure why
he chose to target your family.

38:17.643 --> 38:18.861
We searched his files,

38:18.905 --> 38:20.341
but there was no
concrete evidence.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.299
It was all a fantasy.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.214
We have a contingency plan.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.347
<i>We have a way</i> <i>
to access Steel's computer.</i>

38:26.391 --> 38:28.218
I'm sorry this happened.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.785
I always respected
the Commander.

38:29.829 --> 38:32.005
Well, sadly,
these types of mental breaks

38:32.048 --> 38:33.311
do sometimes happen.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.182
But, rest assured,
when he wakes up,

38:35.225 --> 38:36.836
the military police
will take over

38:36.879 --> 38:38.185
and handle it appropriately.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.322
What happened to him?

38:48.500 --> 38:51.851
When we found him,
he was incoherent, disoriented.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.244
Really, we have no idea.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.307
Naomi, are you okay?

39:15.962 --> 39:16.789
Not really.

39:18.530 --> 39:19.661
Want to talk
about what happened?

39:22.098 --> 39:23.404
I just want to go home.

39:27.974 --> 39:28.801
Home.

39:40.769 --> 39:41.640
You're back.

39:42.989 --> 39:43.903
You guys all right?

39:47.123 --> 39:48.342
I know
this was a hard night...

39:49.778 --> 39:50.997
but everything is okay now.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.091
We'll leave you to it.

40:05.794 --> 40:06.665
Is Nathan here?

40:07.274 --> 40:08.101
He left.

40:09.624 --> 40:10.451
I'm sorry, babe.

40:12.932 --> 40:13.846
Are you okay?

40:20.505 --> 40:21.984
Thank you both for everything.

40:31.516 --> 40:34.170
This is the only roll
that I haven't developed.

40:34.214 --> 40:36.259
The rest are upstairs.

40:36.303 --> 40:40.046
But, no luck
with our project.

40:43.615 --> 40:44.877
Do you want me
to stay with you?

40:47.140 --> 40:48.315
No. I'll be okay.
