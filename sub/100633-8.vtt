00:37.938 --> 00:40.240
Mr. President, Jim Gordon,

00:40.240 --> 00:43.710
aka Gotham PD Commissioner,
aka the Commish,

00:43.710 --> 00:45.378
but you can call me Gordo.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.246
Sir, Gotham City
is finally ready to--

00:47.246 --> 00:48.548
-[secretary] <i>Please hold</i>
<i>for the President.</i>
-Ah!

00:48.548 --> 00:50.718
Sorry, I thought you were
the President.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.252
<i>-No, I'm his secretary.</i>
-Well, yes.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.299
Now that you say it,

00:54.299 --> 00:56.256
it makes sense that
the President wouldn't
answer his own phone.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.491
Just that I don't often hear
of a male secretary.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.127
-This is the President.
-Sir, I, on my own,

01:01.127 --> 01:05.298
with no help from others,
definitely singlehandedly
took out the Injustice League.

01:05.364 --> 01:09.236
Gotham City is ready to
rejoin the United States.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.603
Gordo...
Can I call you that?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.099
I'd prefer that.

01:12.099 --> 01:15.808
Gordo, according to my intel,
there's still one supervillain
who is running amok.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.510
Harley Quinn.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.647
Uh... she's nothing but
a polyp up my bunghole.

01:20.713 --> 01:21.882
Irritating? Sure.

01:21.948 --> 01:24.316
Uncomfortable? Absolutely.

01:24.316 --> 01:27.688
Horrifying to sexual partners
and oftentimes a deal breaker?
Definitely.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.456
<i>But nothing that</i>
<i>a doctor-prescribed cream</i>
<i>can't take care of.</i>

01:30.456 --> 01:31.926
-[camera shutter clicks]
-That is...

01:31.926 --> 01:35.429
a lot of specific knowledge
about anal polyps.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.055
You're talking to an expert.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.433
Look, Gordo,
Harley Quinn caused
the downfall of Gotham.

01:39.498 --> 01:40.640
She's a menace.

01:40.640 --> 01:43.180
<i>She strikes fear into
the heart of the public psyche.</i>

01:43.180 --> 01:45.405
<i>If she's still out there,</i>
<i>Gotham isn't safe.</i>

01:45.405 --> 01:48.375
<i>Take care of Harley Quinn</i>
<i>and I'll put Gotham</i>
<i>back on the map.</i>

01:48.375 --> 01:51.311
I'm coming for you, Quinn.

01:51.378 --> 01:54.528
[theme music playing]

02:02.355 --> 02:04.825
Harls, if we're
going to talk about it,
let's just talk about it.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.760
I mean, pssh,
if you want to,
I guess I could. Yeah.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.662
That was... crazy, right?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.263
[chuckles] So, crazy.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.632
I've been thinking a lot,
and I think it was--

02:11.632 --> 02:13.967
An impetuous,
spur of the moment thing.

02:13.967 --> 02:14.967
-You know?
-Yes.

02:14.967 --> 02:16.699
It was the adrenaline
of escaping, you know.

02:16.699 --> 02:17.699
I just think
it went to our heads.

02:17.699 --> 02:19.705
-Hundred percent.
-We weren't really thinking.

02:19.705 --> 02:21.508
-You know?
-It's so weird and uncanny

02:21.574 --> 02:23.376
how you just said
everything I was
going to say.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.611
I think we just chalk it up
to a crazy moment

02:25.611 --> 02:26.888
where something
crazy happened.

02:26.888 --> 02:27.962
You know what I mean?
I mean, that's it.

02:27.962 --> 02:29.750
Totally. Totally!
It was so me!

02:29.817 --> 02:31.818
It was Harley Quinn,
always doing crazy things!

02:31.884 --> 02:33.486
Always being impetuous!
Hey!

02:33.552 --> 02:34.587
Always kissing people!

02:34.655 --> 02:35.823
-Muah!
-Ugh!

02:35.889 --> 02:39.192
Disgusting!
You're not my type.

02:39.258 --> 02:40.927
Harley, are you sure
you're cool, or...

02:40.927 --> 02:44.264
Yes. I swear to you.
I'm cool. I'm just...
We are cool.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.399
Ugh, great! I'm just glad
we're on the same page.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.000
I mean, I'm getting
married to Kite Man soon.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.302
-You know,
so I gotta focus on that.
-Obvs!

02:50.370 --> 02:51.972
Yeah, I'm super busy, too.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.806
I'm like planning
my next move.
So many moves. All...

02:53.873 --> 02:55.808
Almost too many moves.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.478
Wow, look at that.
I'm actually late to
a move planning meeting.

02:58.544 --> 03:00.280
Oh, this is so good.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.382
Harley, I'm just glad
we talked about this.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.685
And I would never want
anything to mess up
our friendship, you know?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.854
Yes, totally.
Yeah, especially not
over some kiss

03:06.919 --> 03:09.254
that, you know,
didn't even mean anything.

03:09.322 --> 03:12.925
[chuckles awkwardly]
So, are you gonna
tell Kite Man?

03:12.992 --> 03:14.661
[Kite Man]
How could you do this to me?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.830
Babe, I'm so sorry.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.665
Look, I meant to
call for a reservation
and stuff came up.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.064
I said I'm sorry.

03:21.064 --> 03:24.905
Sorry doesn't get us a table
at Senor Mexico's authentic
Mexican adobe house,

03:24.972 --> 03:27.707
which is my parents'
favorite brunch spot
in all of Gotham.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.776
[object clatters]

03:29.842 --> 03:33.379
-Babe, you all right?
-Yes. I'm...
I'm just... It's...

03:33.379 --> 03:34.848
I've got a lot
on my mind right now.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.349
Hey. I'm sorry for putting
so much pressure on you.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.252
It's just the first time
they're meeting you,

03:39.252 --> 03:40.788
and I want them to love you
as much as I do,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.588
because, no pressure,
if they don't love you

03:42.588 --> 03:43.949
they won't approve
of the wedding,

03:43.949 --> 03:45.063
and then they won't
come to the wedding!

03:45.063 --> 03:46.727
Honey, I will make sure
that they love me.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.229
Because parents
always love me.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.396
I mean, not my parents
or any other parents.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.399
But the point is
for your parents? Ah!

03:52.466 --> 03:54.768
I'm gonna just
blow them away.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.836
God, I love you.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.473
Okay.
So, as we all know,
I'm super busy,

03:59.538 --> 04:01.608
I'm a crazy busy,
busiest I've ever been.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.443
The question is,
what am I super busy with?

04:04.510 --> 04:05.704
What's next?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.914
I thought we were
gonna chill out and have fun

04:07.914 --> 04:09.549
after we took
the Injustice League out?

04:09.549 --> 04:10.794
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna have fun.

04:10.794 --> 04:13.687
As I become
the world's most feared
supervillain!

04:13.753 --> 04:15.421
That's not you.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.557
The gravitas just isn't there.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.326
The gravitas is there!

04:19.326 --> 04:23.497
Harley, first I want
to apologize for these pussies!

04:23.497 --> 04:26.733
I, for one,
welcome you pushing
the evil envelope.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.567
This is what
I've dreamed of.

04:28.634 --> 04:31.071
If you want to do
some truly evil shit,

04:31.071 --> 04:32.706
then I'm your guy!

04:32.773 --> 04:34.507
What are your thoughts
on killing puppies?

04:34.574 --> 04:35.942
-[both gasp]
-[bike revs]

04:36.009 --> 04:37.877
Harley, I've come to
warn you about my--

04:37.944 --> 04:40.880
-Wait, who are you?
-Um... Batgirl. Anyway...

04:40.947 --> 04:42.139
All right.
You know what?

04:42.139 --> 04:43.951
As a community,
we should really get together

04:43.951 --> 04:45.685
and start coming up
with more creative names.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.262
This is bullshit.

04:47.262 --> 04:51.490
Can I just say,
I love the stitch work
on your costume, girl.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.093
[laughs] I see you.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.360
Aw, geez, thanks.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.062
Why the hell are you here?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.966
Gordon's coming
to take you down.

04:57.966 --> 05:01.334
You are what stands
in the way of Gotham
rejoining the United States.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.540
And I've come here
to warn you

05:02.540 --> 05:03.769
because he thinks
you're a villain,

05:03.769 --> 05:05.000
but I know that you're not.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.807
What? I'm bad as hell.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.074
Total villain over here!

05:08.141 --> 05:09.500
Fuck, yeah!

05:09.500 --> 05:12.379
That's the Harley
I've been waiting for.

05:12.444 --> 05:13.899
Own it, girl!

05:13.899 --> 05:15.949
You did kick
the Legion of Doom
out of Gotham,

05:16.016 --> 05:17.783
killed Joker,
got rid of
the Injustice League.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.451
Those were
all heroic things.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.588
This is what we
were just saying.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.389
See? Batgirl gets it.

05:23.389 --> 05:24.725
You want me
to melt her mind?

05:24.790 --> 05:26.790
I will melt her mind.

05:26.790 --> 05:29.461
All I'm saying is lay low,
and hopefully this'll
all blow over.

05:29.528 --> 05:30.944
No time to lay low!

05:30.944 --> 05:33.365
I was just telling Ivy
how I am
a very busy person,

05:33.432 --> 05:34.577
and that's what I am.

05:34.577 --> 05:36.603
So I am going
to lay very high,
thank you.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.605
Harley, he won't stop
until he gets you.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.439
You heard about
what he did to Two-Face,

05:40.439 --> 05:42.009
and Two-Face had
a whole mess of goons.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.110
So, what you're saying is
I need an army.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.081
No, that's 100%
not what I was say--

05:47.081 --> 05:49.583
-You tell
Commissioner Gor-dumb...
-Nice!

05:49.649 --> 05:51.817
...that I am
the baddest bitch in town.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.754
I'm Harley Quinn!
I'm impetuous!

05:53.819 --> 05:55.422
I kiss people at random!

05:55.487 --> 05:57.091
-Muah!
-What's happening?

05:57.156 --> 05:59.992
I am a supervillain,
and Gordon better sack up

06:00.060 --> 06:02.995
and prepare
for an all-out war
with me and my army.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.831
-Thanks for the heads up.
-No, again,

06:04.831 --> 06:07.834
-that was 100% not
what I was saying--
-[door slams]

06:07.901 --> 06:09.103
All right, listen. New plan.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.569
We are gonna defeat Gordon.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.872
We just need an evil army.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.740
Anyone know how
we can get an evil army?

06:14.740 --> 06:15.975
I am rock hard right now!

06:16.043 --> 06:17.610
That's nasty.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.779
Harley, what has
gotten into you?

06:19.779 --> 06:23.817
Ever since you and Ivy
emerged from Bane's pit,
you seem unlike yourself.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.752
Yeah,
you never said anything
about being a warlord.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.555
Plus, where are we
going to get an army?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.824
Especially since
the goons have unionized.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.427
Nothing happened in the pit,
and I am absolutely being
totally like myself.

06:34.427 --> 06:35.896
And no one is
getting in my way.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.418
Not even Gordon.

06:37.418 --> 06:39.800
You know what?
I think I know where
we can get an army.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.002
But it's some
real deal villain shit.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.571
You got to
get your hands dirty.
Are you down to do that?

06:44.637 --> 06:46.807
Bitch, please.
I am super down.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.040
This is exactly
what I want to do.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.810
I'm Harley Quinn.
I'm impetuous!

06:49.877 --> 06:51.944
I kiss people for no reason.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.048
-Muah!
-[King Shark giggles]

06:54.113 --> 06:56.516
Yeah, you've made that
whole kissing thing
really clear, Harley.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.119
Hey, sup. Uh, I don't
really care either way,

06:59.185 --> 07:01.555
but what're the chances
you have a four top?

07:01.620 --> 07:03.456
Four top is
restaurant speak for--

07:03.456 --> 07:05.692
A table, for four people.
Thanks.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.994
My little foodie.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.562
Yeah, it's a three-hour wait.
Sorry.

07:08.627 --> 07:10.029
[groans]
Oh, boy!

07:10.096 --> 07:12.233
Um, babe,
those people over there

07:12.298 --> 07:15.002
that look like a country club
fucked a yacht club
are waving at us.

07:15.069 --> 07:16.970
Charles dear, over here!

07:17.036 --> 07:20.206
Mother, Father,
please meet the love
of my life, Pamela.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.708
You didn't make a reservation.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.211
-Mother, I am so sorry.
-Oh, God.

07:24.211 --> 07:28.615
I had to have the credit card
company concierge read
management the riot act

07:28.682 --> 07:31.151
and we still got stuck here
with the hoi polloi.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.620
Our usual booth was taken.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.788
Oh. You know what?
Let me talk to the manager.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.057
Good luck to her, I say.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.627
[couple yell]

07:40.694 --> 07:42.862
Well, look at that.
A booth just opened up.

07:42.930 --> 07:46.165
Pam, I must say,
I like your style.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.666
Well, shall we?

07:47.733 --> 07:49.970
<i>Senorita,</i> can we
get four mimosas

07:50.036 --> 07:53.240
and an order of
your mashed avocado?
<i>Gracias.</i>

07:53.307 --> 07:57.043
And if I don't
escape my shackles
in five minutes,

07:57.110 --> 08:00.047
I will plunge to my death!

08:00.113 --> 08:02.014
Okay. Where's this army
you're promising?

08:02.081 --> 08:03.884
Well, as you all know,

08:03.884 --> 08:06.586
I have always had
a huge hard-on
for world domination.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.588
-Well, that's on brand.
-Just disgusting.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.024
And there is truly only one
foolproof way I've found
to get it.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.526
That idiot in
the technicolor dreamcoat

08:14.593 --> 08:16.297
has a device
called a "Mother Box"

08:16.362 --> 08:18.899
that can create
a "Boom Tube."

08:18.966 --> 08:21.033
We take the Boom Tube
to Apokolips,

08:21.033 --> 08:24.004
where Darkseid
has a whole shitload
of amazing armies.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.704
We kiss Darkseid's ring,

08:25.704 --> 08:27.307
pledge fealty, blah blah blah,

08:27.374 --> 08:29.942
he gives us an army
of flying monkey lizards,

08:30.009 --> 08:32.078
and we take out Gotham
by supper.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.246
Eff, yes!

08:33.313 --> 08:34.914
I'm an eff maybe...

08:34.981 --> 08:37.150
I find that plan
to have many holes.

08:37.216 --> 08:39.986
How would one even
procure a Mother's Box?

08:40.052 --> 08:42.855
[laughs]
I am so glad you asked!

08:42.855 --> 08:44.791
Get ready for a BAFTA,

08:44.857 --> 08:46.927
because you're gonna
be playin' a drunk.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.663
A modern Falstaff! Perfect.

08:49.729 --> 08:50.998
Company!

08:51.063 --> 08:56.035
Ah! Oh, villainous, burp,
company

08:56.102 --> 08:59.840
hath been, burp,
the spoil of my--

08:59.905 --> 09:02.142
Shut the fuck up!
I'm the director.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.044
You stumble onstage
and distract security.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.980
You just lost your BAFTA.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.049
[groaning]

09:10.116 --> 09:12.219
Then, while Miracle
is chained up,

09:12.285 --> 09:13.854
I'm gonna go into his mind,

09:13.854 --> 09:15.322
figure out where he keeps
the Mother Box and...

09:15.322 --> 09:17.357
-Too late.
-Hey, you're not allowed
onstage.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.958
[audience screaming]

09:20.226 --> 09:21.594
It was just
in his dressing room.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.763
So, hold on
to your barf bags!

09:23.763 --> 09:25.264
We're going to Apokolips.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.234
Ha!

09:27.234 --> 09:29.101
There goes my
new year's resolution
to not bite my nails

09:29.168 --> 09:31.971
or jump into any
inter-dimensional portals.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.307
[Dr. Psycho laughs]

09:33.374 --> 09:34.640
Whee!

09:37.378 --> 09:39.846
[cheering loudly]

09:39.913 --> 09:42.982
So... So, then I said,
"Did anyone call for kelp?"

09:43.049 --> 09:45.652
And then I wrapped
Aquaman up in...

09:45.719 --> 09:46.852
Can you guess? Kelp.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.855
You are a hoot!

09:48.922 --> 09:50.123
Isn't she, Darryl?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.091
Charles is
one lucky son of a gun.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.293
-Hell yeah, I am.
-Charles! Language!

09:54.293 --> 09:56.897
Well...
But, it's kinda like
my catch phrase.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.697
Well, then find a new one!

09:58.697 --> 10:00.333
Yes, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me,

10:00.333 --> 10:03.136
I'm just gonna go
wash my hands
before we chow down.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.719
[whispers] I love you.

10:04.719 --> 10:07.073
Our son getting married
was a shock in and of itself,

10:07.073 --> 10:11.378
but to find out his fiancee
has actual super powers!

10:11.445 --> 10:14.148
[both] Our grandkids
are going to have
superpowers like us!

10:14.214 --> 10:16.015
Oh, you...
So you guys have
superpowers?

10:16.082 --> 10:18.351
Oh, sure.
I can harness
the power of cold,

10:18.418 --> 10:20.354
and this one has
the old gift of flight.

10:20.421 --> 10:23.690
So, you can imagine
how disappointed we were

10:23.756 --> 10:26.092
when poor Charles
was born... powerless.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.028
Well, he has his kite.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.095
Ugh!

10:29.095 --> 10:31.197
Pamela, we want the best
for our grandkids,

10:31.197 --> 10:33.200
and that is them
having superpowers,

10:33.200 --> 10:34.701
not pretending to have them.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.203
And you're the answer
to our prayers.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.270
Well... [sighs] Good.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.855
[grunts and laughs]

10:54.855 --> 10:58.292
This is gonna be
the last mustache
you ever see, Quinn.

10:58.359 --> 11:01.028
Wow, that is a lot of guns.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.163
Or, not enough guns.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.365
Dad, I don't think
you should go up
against Harley.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.344
Oh, that old saw.

11:07.344 --> 11:09.870
[sarcastically] Because
she's a girl, and boys against
girls is unfair.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.437
Um, no.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.407
Because rumor has it
she's going to have
an army.

11:13.474 --> 11:15.142
Thousands of people might die.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.710
You might die.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.844
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I see what you're saying.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.178
Ugh! Thank you!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.779
-I need an army!
-No!

11:20.779 --> 11:23.450
That is 100% not
what I was saying--

11:23.517 --> 11:25.719
Oh, frick!

11:25.784 --> 11:27.200
[Gordon]
Citizens of Gotham!

11:27.200 --> 11:29.523
You're here today
because you
answered the call.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.791
We have an opportunity

11:31.791 --> 11:33.960
to save our
beloved Gotham City

11:33.960 --> 11:39.027
and get back
our rightful place
in the United States.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.269
That means clean water,
fresh food,

11:42.269 --> 11:44.337
and overpriced
Internet providers!

11:44.404 --> 11:46.373
[all cheering]

11:46.440 --> 11:48.307
But in order to do that,

11:48.307 --> 11:52.446
we have to take down
the scourge
that is Harley Quinn.

11:52.513 --> 11:54.813
-Yes, Harley Quinn.
-[man] All right!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.517
Wait, are you
cheering for Harley,

11:56.583 --> 11:59.119
or cheering for
taking down Harley?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.287
It's gotta be
taking down, right?

12:00.287 --> 12:01.488
[crowd cheering]

12:01.554 --> 12:03.322
[laughs] Okay. Good.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.427
It was just
the way I worded it,
it wasn't...

12:06.493 --> 12:08.261
Anyway. I...

12:08.327 --> 12:11.365
For too long
we've allowed villains
to run our lives,

12:11.432 --> 12:13.399
and they destroyed
our beautiful city.

12:13.399 --> 12:17.037
Well, I will not
let that stand,
and neither will you!

12:17.104 --> 12:21.264
-Who's with me?
-[crowd cheering]

12:25.044 --> 12:27.080
There was a war, vermin.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.548
And I won.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.985
Your future belongs
to Darkseid now.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.352
[all grunting]

12:33.986 --> 12:35.221
[screams]

12:35.889 --> 12:36.990
[all gasp]

12:36.990 --> 12:38.392
I'm giving your BAFTA to him.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.094
[Darkseid]
You seek an army,
Harley Quinn?

12:41.160 --> 12:44.096
-Um--
-Are you capable of
wielding such power?

12:44.163 --> 12:47.100
-Yeah, I--
-The power to take away
a people's confusion

12:47.167 --> 12:49.436
and replace it
with obedience?

12:49.503 --> 12:51.504
-Yes, I--
-To liberate a people

12:51.572 --> 12:54.006
and give them
one clear purpose.

12:54.073 --> 12:57.009
One goal,
to die for your will.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.916
Oh, you're done.
Okay yes,
totes to all that stuff.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.351
Let me get that army!

13:05.418 --> 13:07.821
Mr. Great and
Powerful Darkseid.

13:07.886 --> 13:09.990
I sense a great pain in you.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.258
Nope, no pain. I'm good.

13:11.325 --> 13:14.027
An anger, born from a want.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.828
A want that was not met.

13:15.894 --> 13:17.245
If we could just
move on to the--

13:17.245 --> 13:20.433
Are you trying to fill
an empty hole in your life,
Harley Quinn?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.057
What is this guy,
my therapist?

13:22.057 --> 13:26.573
There are some holes
that not even an army
of Parademons can fill.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.442
Definitely not.
All my holes are filled up
to the brim.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.845
Nothing? Really?

13:31.845 --> 13:33.179
Look, I'm just here
for that army.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.980
So, you know,
what's the haps on that?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.071
The dwarf did not tell you?

13:37.071 --> 13:40.354
Okay, I may have
come up here at a different
time to ask for an army.

13:40.421 --> 13:41.955
-I didn't mention that?
-No!

13:41.955 --> 13:44.291
And I am
a very active listener.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.225
[Darkseid] You must
prove yourself to me.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.596
He was too cowardly to do so.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.364
The task is simple.

13:50.431 --> 13:52.899
Defeat Granny Goodness
in combat,

13:52.899 --> 13:55.436
and I will give
her scepter to you,

13:55.436 --> 13:58.504
which you will use
to command the Parademons.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.000
So, I just gotta
beat up an old lady
and I get an army?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.841
-I can do that.
-[loud thudding]

14:07.913 --> 14:09.549
Prepare to die!

14:11.317 --> 14:12.985
[footsteps thudding]

14:14.587 --> 14:16.355
And this is why
I got cold feet.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.423
You got this, Quinn.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.597
[grunting]

14:31.203 --> 14:33.038
[both yelling]

14:33.474 --> 14:34.474
Ah!

14:46.720 --> 14:48.455
[grunting]

14:48.522 --> 14:52.493
[gasps] I promised myself
I'd never kill an old person.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.495
I'd let the American
healthcare system do that.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.496
But we need to
get Harley's back.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.166
I fear Darkseid
clearly laid out the rules.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.503
If she doesn't do it herself,
she does not get the army.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.971
Don't worry,
she's gonna do it herself.
[cracks knuckles]

15:05.706 --> 15:07.474
You fools!

15:07.541 --> 15:10.610
You thought some
little girl could defeat me?

15:10.677 --> 15:13.078
Now get ready
for some cookies, milk,

15:13.145 --> 15:16.549
and a lifetime of torture
in Granny's dungeon.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.485
[laughs evilly]

15:19.452 --> 15:21.288
Prepare to die.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.293
[laughing evilly]

15:26.360 --> 15:29.059
Yes, still got it!

15:33.701 --> 15:35.635
[groggily] Where am I?
Did I do it?

15:35.702 --> 15:38.739
Yes, Harley Quinn,
you defeated Granny Goodness.

15:38.806 --> 15:40.173
Yeah, you did.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.243
Huzzah! Harley!
You are a hero!

15:43.309 --> 15:45.511
It was so smart of her
to play possum like that.

15:45.511 --> 15:49.649
You think she unconsciously
flew through the air, idiots?

15:49.716 --> 15:54.716
Rise, Harley Quinn,
commander of
my Parademon army.

16:06.032 --> 16:08.201
Aw! Thanks, D-Train.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.368
Uh, Lord, sir.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.052
All right! Y'all ready
to hand Gordon his ass

16:26.052 --> 16:29.489
and show him once and for all
that Harley Quinn is Gotham's
true boss

16:29.556 --> 16:31.224
and the baddest villain of all?

16:31.291 --> 16:32.692
[roaring]

16:32.759 --> 16:34.394
Yes. Yes!

16:34.461 --> 16:35.763
Fuck, yes!

16:35.828 --> 16:38.465
I mean, I did this,
but also fuck, yes!

16:38.532 --> 16:40.466
Boomtube us home, psycho!

16:42.769 --> 16:46.340
I have to be honest,
I am very scared about
this whole thing.

16:46.405 --> 16:50.143
As am I. You can't tell,
but I've clayed myself.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.346
[Latin music playing]

16:55.581 --> 16:58.284
Whoa. Babe, you wanna
get frisky right here?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.422
What about the 'rents?

16:59.422 --> 17:01.554
Why do you let your parents
treat you like shit?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.057
What am I supposed to do?
They're my parents.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.794
Let's do this again
next week, Ivy, darling.

17:06.861 --> 17:09.195
Don't worry,
I already made a reservation,

17:09.195 --> 17:13.098
so Charles needn't
cloud his mind with
simple tasks.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.401
-[both laugh]
-You know what?

17:14.468 --> 17:16.236
-Fuck you guys.
-Beg your pardon?

17:16.303 --> 17:17.671
Yeah, I said, fuck you.

17:17.738 --> 17:19.439
Because first of all,
I'm the one

17:19.439 --> 17:21.173
who messed up
the goddamn
reservation, okay.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.076
Chuck asked me
several times not to forget,

17:23.076 --> 17:25.311
because for some reason
he cares about you two.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.815
And then,
he took the heat for it
because he cares about me,

17:27.882 --> 17:31.218
and for some reason,
what you two
think about me.

17:31.284 --> 17:34.488
So, yeah!
He's a kind, loving,
supportive partner.

17:34.555 --> 17:38.491
And the only miracle here
is that you two ghouls
somehow raised him.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.728
And another thing,
he's not lucky to have me,

17:40.794 --> 17:42.328
I'm lucky to have him!

17:42.395 --> 17:43.864
So, fuck off!

17:46.165 --> 17:48.201
Hell! Yeah!

17:48.268 --> 17:51.136
-See you at the wedding?
-[Poison Ivy chuckles]

17:51.203 --> 17:53.773
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Is that a Boom Tube?

17:53.840 --> 17:56.676
Uh. Sorry,
just got excited and...
[chuckles sheepishly]

17:56.743 --> 17:58.412
No baby, not that.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.846
-That!
-Looks like it's
over the Dead Mall.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.848
Hang on, wait, which way...
That's east...

18:01.915 --> 18:03.717
No, it is. Oh, my God!

18:03.784 --> 18:04.834
Harley!

18:19.900 --> 18:22.201
Dad, you don't have to do this.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.605
If saving Gotham means
I have to gun down
another lady clown,

18:25.672 --> 18:26.840
then so be it.

18:26.840 --> 18:27.840
<i>Wait. What do you</i>
<i>mean another--</i>

18:29.576 --> 18:31.510
[all yelling]

18:31.577 --> 18:33.846
[all grunting]

18:33.913 --> 18:38.913
Oh! Probably be best if you
turn around your
merry band of meatbags.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.887
And why the hell
would I do that?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.799
[Dr. Psycho laughs]

18:42.799 --> 18:46.692
Gordo, I have a flying army
from a hell planet
under my control.

18:46.692 --> 18:50.430
Well, I made my decision!
And I never back down
from my decisions.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.300
It's a terrible quality
that has ruined most of
my personal relationships,

18:54.300 --> 18:55.367
so bring it!

18:55.367 --> 18:56.903
It's your funeral, old man.

18:56.971 --> 18:58.672
-Uh-uh, it's yours.
-Don't think so.

18:58.739 --> 19:00.440
Well, I do think so.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.476
Feels like you're
overcompensating
for something.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.577
Why is everybody
up my ass about that?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.179
Nothing happened!

19:06.246 --> 19:07.647
This is just
my Wednesday, bitch.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.383
-Not buying it.
-I don't give a shit!

19:10.450 --> 19:12.218
[Dr. Psycho] Fuck, yes!

19:12.285 --> 19:14.421
My God!
Gaping sphincter in the sky.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.455
[Dr. Psycho] I'm coming!

19:17.723 --> 19:19.374
Tanks, now!

19:24.730 --> 19:25.730
[screeches]

19:26.666 --> 19:27.666
Uh-oh.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.852
[screeches]

19:46.452 --> 19:47.452
Ah!

19:58.031 --> 19:59.700
[laughing evilly]

19:59.767 --> 20:01.801
Harley! What the hell
is going on here?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.519
Yeah, while you were out
gettin' brunch,

20:03.519 --> 20:06.506
I was beating up an old lady
to get a Parademon army
from another galaxy.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.008
You beat up an old lady?

20:08.075 --> 20:09.910
She was super jacked!

20:09.910 --> 20:11.979
And now I'm gonna
take over all of Gotham!

20:12.046 --> 20:15.715
So what, you really just
want kill thousands of
people just because?

20:15.782 --> 20:17.851
Because I'm
Harley fucking Quinn!

20:17.917 --> 20:19.385
I'm always doing
crazy things!

20:19.452 --> 20:21.320
Always being impetuous,
you know?

20:21.387 --> 20:22.855
Always kissing people
and shit!

20:22.923 --> 20:24.391
This is just my Wednesday.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.992
Yeah. It's actually Thursday.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.828
Anyway, look. You know me,
I mean, I'm ride or die, but...

20:28.895 --> 20:33.895
I mean, is this really
the ride you envisioned?

20:36.603 --> 20:37.703
[screeching]

20:37.770 --> 20:38.939
Uh, not exactly.

20:39.006 --> 20:40.641
What's the endgame?

20:41.708 --> 20:45.307
What do you really want?

20:49.548 --> 20:51.417
What the hell are you doing?

20:53.452 --> 20:54.452
No!

21:02.429 --> 21:03.763
[Harley]
The city's yours, Gordo.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.333
I know what I want,
and it's not this.

21:06.398 --> 21:10.037
We were gonna take over
the fucking world and
you're squandering it all!

21:10.104 --> 21:11.971
[screams] Ow!
[clanging]

21:12.839 --> 21:14.217
Are you kidding me?

21:14.217 --> 21:16.076
Oh, I should have known
this was too good to be true.

21:16.076 --> 21:17.711
You got no balls, Quinn.

21:17.778 --> 21:18.878
Fuck this!

21:20.013 --> 21:21.815
See you back at home?

21:21.882 --> 21:23.583
No! I'm out of the crew.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.019
I fucking quit.
See you never.

21:25.085 --> 21:26.819
This mean I won?

21:26.886 --> 21:28.521
I won! [laughs triumphantly]

21:28.587 --> 21:32.358
This is why you don't
back down, people!

21:34.994 --> 21:37.463
Look, I can explain
the whole <i>Game of Thrones</i>
Khaleesi thing okay.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.166
All... All this has just been
me avoiding something

21:40.166 --> 21:41.900
that I need to
talk to you about

21:41.900 --> 21:43.903
and if I don't do it now,
it will be too late.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.874
Look, [sighs] if you really
need to say it, just--

21:46.940 --> 21:49.108
Harley! Cool Parademons.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.045
Hey! Did Ivy tell you
what she just did?

21:51.111 --> 21:53.413
How she's the coolest,
hottest fiancee

21:53.480 --> 21:55.949
a regular guy
with superpowers like me
could ever ask for?

21:56.016 --> 21:59.720
Well, I mean, I wasn't just
gonna sit there and
watch your parents be assholes

21:59.720 --> 22:01.855
to the man that
I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

22:01.922 --> 22:03.123
Mmm!

22:04.691 --> 22:06.188
[metal creaking]

22:06.188 --> 22:09.096
Oh, buddy! Those Parademons
are dry humping a taco truck.

22:09.163 --> 22:10.864
I'm gonna go
snap a pic for Insta.

22:10.864 --> 22:13.500
Ah, man.
I love that idiot.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.468
-What were you
gonna tell me, Harls?
-Um...

22:15.535 --> 22:17.470
We need to talk about...

22:17.537 --> 22:20.707
What you wanna do
for your bachelorette party!

22:20.707 --> 22:22.209
Really? That's what
you wanted to tell me?

22:22.209 --> 22:23.476
Yeah!
