<i>Department Chief!</i>

00:19.180 --> 00:21.020
<i>Are you all right, Department
Chief?
</i>

00:21.020 --> 00:22.850
<i>Who did it end up being?</i>

00:22.850 --> 00:27.620
<i>Han Gyu Hyeok, a lawyer
specializing in criminal cases.</i>

00:27.620 --> 00:31.660
<i>If it's for money or to win a case,
he will be an unscrupulous lawyer.</i>

00:31.660 --> 00:32.759
<i>Lee Jae Hun,</i>

00:32.759 --> 00:35.700
<i>for the crimes of smuggling and
selling drugs, assault, atrocities,
murder, disposing of a body.</i>

00:35.700 --> 00:37.530
<i>According to my current analysis,</i>

00:37.530 --> 00:40.100
<i>after Han Gyu Hyeok deliberately
released a criminal,</i>

00:40.100 --> 00:41.940
<i>they were then kidnapped and
murdered.</i>

00:41.940 --> 00:43.040
<i>Who are all of you?</i>

00:43.040 --> 00:44.300
<i>The verdict is the death penalty.</i>

00:44.870 --> 00:47.810
<i>Death penalty. Death penalty.
Death penalty...</i>

00:47.810 --> 00:48.670
<i>is the verdict.</i>

00:48.700 --> 00:50.740
<i>Korea's unreasonable judicial system.</i>

00:50.740 --> 00:52.950
<i>A monster was born inside
Han Gyu Hyeok.</i>

00:52.950 --> 00:55.150
<i>Please assist our investigation.</i>

00:55.150 --> 00:56.980
<i>Okay. Let's investigate this
together.
</i>

00:56.980 --> 00:58.820
<i>This is Prosecutor Nam Min Su.</i>

00:58.820 --> 01:00.650
<i>From now on, he will assist with
our investigation.</i>

01:00.650 --> 01:01.760
<i>Let's work together.</i>

01:01.760 --> 01:03.590
<i>Gim Yong Cheol... is dead.</i>

01:03.590 --> 01:05.060
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

01:05.060 --> 01:06.530
<i>It must have been an
internal action.</i>

01:06.530 --> 01:07.250
<i>It has been handled.</i>

01:07.260 --> 01:09.830
<i>What these all have in common...
This!</i>

01:09.830 --> 01:11.300
<i>Everything is ready.</i>

01:11.300 --> 01:11.970
<i>I found it!</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:14.970
<i>Repeat offenders who had been
caught in the act, all of them are
missing.</i>

01:14.970 --> 01:16.740
<i>What are you all doing?</i>

01:16.820 --> 01:18.640
<i>This isn't the kind of justice
we were seeking.
</i>

01:18.640 --> 01:22.310
<i>Will you let them all be in danger
because of your so-called justice?</i>

01:22.310 --> 01:23.780
<i>We're going to change it.
</i>

01:23.780 --> 01:24.880
<i>Nam Min Su.</i>

01:24.880 --> 01:28.490
<i>We're going to kill all the bastards
like that in this world!</i>

01:30.750 --> 01:32.810
<i>I will make it change.

Yes, Detective Jeong.

02:57.370 --> 02:59.940
=Let go of me! Let go of me!=

02:59.940 --> 03:01.410
Detective Jeong, what's going on?

03:01.410 --> 03:03.590
- Let go of me!
- Be quiet!

03:04.840 --> 03:06.350
Detective Jeong!

03:10.320 --> 03:12.220
Detective Jeong, what's wrong?

03:21.230 --> 03:23.750
As of today, Saranghoe
will disappear.

03:24.160 --> 03:28.570
I will take responsibility for all
that has been done in the name
of Saranghoe,

03:28.570 --> 03:30.480
so leave.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.560
What if I can't do that?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.950
Do you still not understand?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.900
You have no control over this
organization.

03:42.760 --> 03:46.190
The person who should quit is
not me, but you.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.910
Come to your senses, Nam Min Su!

03:49.310 --> 03:51.580
You're not the law and not God.

03:52.380 --> 03:56.830
If people find out you've been
killing innocent people according
to your own rules,

03:57.060 --> 03:59.630
do you think the members will
follow you?

04:02.180 --> 04:04.350
You have failed.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.550
It is only right that you should
bear that responsibility.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.680
Nam Min Su!

04:11.750 --> 04:13.600
From this day on,

04:14.230 --> 04:16.959
Saranghoe will be reborn.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.530
Chief Choe!

06:10.290 --> 06:11.750
Don't move.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.580
I'm a police officer.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.840
Bring him down now.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.980
Don't move!

06:30.490 --> 06:31.720
I will shoot you if you move.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.040
Then, go ahead and shoot!

06:36.490 --> 06:37.960
Don't move!

06:37.960 --> 06:40.740
They don't help when you need
them, so are police so great?

06:40.760 --> 06:44.420
Did you ever do anything for us?
You never helped any of us!

06:49.700 --> 06:51.660
This isn't helping anyone either.

06:51.690 --> 06:53.510
What do you mean it's not
helping?

07:14.440 --> 07:15.760
<i>The police are here!</i>

07:15.760 --> 07:17.290
<i>Run!</i>

07:28.070 --> 07:29.710
Are you all right?

07:29.710 --> 07:31.910
Did you find Han Gyu Hyeok?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.380
What are you doing here?

07:33.380 --> 07:35.880
Team leader called me.

07:48.430 --> 07:49.530
Hey.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.150
Wake up.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.190
Hey, Yun Cheo Yong!

08:02.380 --> 08:04.060
Are you all right?

08:04.950 --> 08:07.150
They all went that way.
Go after them.

08:07.150 --> 08:08.500
Yes.

08:18.530 --> 08:19.960
Those bastards!

08:20.310 --> 08:22.830
How can those people do
something like this?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.600
What about Han Gyu Hyeok?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.520
We don't know where he's gone.

08:29.390 --> 08:31.160
There's no way out that way.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.770
We didn't even see their
shadows out there.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.179
<i>I'm really about to go crazy!</i>

08:38.350 --> 08:40.179
What are you guys doing?

08:40.299 --> 08:42.870
Hurry and look for evidence.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.590
I have to leave first.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.690
Where do you have to go?

08:45.690 --> 08:49.360
I'm afraid something has
happened to Detective Jeong.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.560
Track Detective Jeong's phone
location and let me know.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.390
What do you mean? What
happened to Detective Jeong?

08:53.390 --> 08:56.330
We'll take over here.
You and Cheo Yong go quickly!

08:56.330 --> 08:57.500
<i>Let's go together!</i>

09:04.080 --> 09:05.620
Search quickly.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.760
Team leader!

09:21.660 --> 09:23.770
Okay.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.940
Detective Jeong!

09:32.500 --> 09:34.150
Jeong Ha Yun!

09:50.930 --> 09:52.310
What's going on?

09:52.490 --> 09:54.320
What are you talking about?

09:54.320 --> 09:57.260
You infiltrated their headquarters
and got nothing, does that make
sense?

09:57.260 --> 10:03.130
I'm sorry. They escaped through
an emergency exit.

10:03.130 --> 10:04.600
Yes.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.900
Also, Detective Jeong...

10:07.900 --> 10:10.510
we think she's been kidnapped.

10:13.770 --> 10:17.810
Whoever it was, they must die,
right?

10:17.810 --> 10:19.650
Toward Yeongdeungpo?

10:19.650 --> 10:21.530
Okay, got it.

10:34.330 --> 10:35.800
Hey!

10:35.800 --> 10:38.730
You know who I am and you
dare to provoke me?

10:38.730 --> 10:42.480
When Crazy Ghost gets here,
you're dead, do you know that?

10:42.640 --> 10:43.870
Come here and untie me.

10:43.870 --> 10:47.510
Then I might be kind enough
to forgive you.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.500
You're really...

10:54.630 --> 10:56.450
Just be quiet!

11:17.270 --> 11:19.300
The last signal was from this
area.

11:19.310 --> 11:22.230
Let's split up and look for her,
then call if we find her.

11:48.100 --> 11:52.520
I have to find a way to escape
so I can save eonni.

12:06.450 --> 12:09.780
What should I do? My time is
almost over.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.470
<i>Eonni, this is Na Yeong.</i>

12:43.520 --> 12:46.550
That female detective, get rid
of her.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.650
<i>Eonni, this is Na Yeong.</i>

13:06.650 --> 13:08.850
<i>You've been kidnapped by some
bad guys. </i>

13:08.850 --> 13:10.320
<i>Just hold on a little while.</i>

13:10.320 --> 13:11.790
Na Yeong.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.140
Eonni, just wait a bit.

13:13.150 --> 13:15.460
I'll get Ajussi and bring him here.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.520
Okay?

13:19.280 --> 13:20.910
They're tracking her?

13:21.330 --> 13:24.220
Yes. I'll handle it right now.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.940
Handle it?

13:27.780 --> 13:29.170
Don't tell me?

14:52.890 --> 14:54.580
I haven't found her.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.460
Eonni, hurry!

16:05.760 --> 16:07.530
Are you all right?

16:38.060 --> 16:40.990
You can't even take care of
a woman properly?

16:41.150 --> 16:42.740
I'm sorry.

16:52.520 --> 16:53.990
We're back.

16:54.090 --> 16:56.630
Detective Jeong!

16:56.780 --> 16:58.200
Are you all right?

16:58.610 --> 17:00.810
I'm sorry for making all of
you worry.

17:00.810 --> 17:02.730
As long as you came back safely.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.480
Do you need to go to the hospital?

17:04.480 --> 17:06.800
I'm fine. Good to go.

17:07.050 --> 17:08.210
<i>Move.</i>

17:09.490 --> 17:12.930
I'm telling you, if I was one step
later, it would have been big
trouble.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.760
These guys were swarming,

17:14.760 --> 17:17.050
so using these rock-hard fists...

17:24.930 --> 17:27.240
What are you looking at,
you bastard?

17:27.240 --> 17:28.339
Move!

17:28.500 --> 17:32.010
If not for me, there would have
been big trouble.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.320
Ajussi, you worked hard too.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.490
=Choe Hyeong Seok.=

17:43.760 --> 17:47.060
=Robbery, murder, disposing
a body...=

17:47.060 --> 17:50.000
Hey, that's Han Gyu Hyeok's voice.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.450
That's right.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.910
Han Gyu Hyeok, you bastard,
we got you.

17:59.910 --> 18:04.310
Like this, there's no way Han
Gyu Hyeok can wiggle out of it.

18:04.310 --> 18:09.560
This is how he justifies killing
people, I guess.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.950
Call Prosecutor Nam right now
and apply for an arrest warrant.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.890
Issue a travel abroad restriction
as a wanted fugitive.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.290
- Yes.
- Yes.

18:21.930 --> 18:24.560
<i>We sentence the defendant
to death.</i>

18:27.070 --> 18:30.070
<i>Are you going to continue to
remain silent?</i>

18:30.740 --> 18:32.210
<i>You were at the scene of a
murder.</i>

18:32.210 --> 18:35.880
<i>Han Gyu Hyeok and the murder
scene have all been recorded. </i>

18:36.120 --> 18:37.710
I'll beat you to death!

18:37.710 --> 18:39.160
Hurry and talk!

18:41.170 --> 18:43.390
Where is Han Gyu Hyeok?

18:43.950 --> 18:46.720
I asked you, where is Han Gyu
Hyeok?

18:47.250 --> 18:49.090
Think carefully before you decide.

18:49.090 --> 18:52.390
Those other guys, do you think
they'll save you?

18:52.390 --> 18:56.390
If you're talking about Saranghoe,
I'm willing to obey.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.630
Saranghoe?

18:58.630 --> 19:02.860
Oh, so you guys call yourselves
"Saranghoe."

19:03.400 --> 19:05.240
<i>You finally decided to confess.</i>

19:05.240 --> 19:06.710
<i>Just keep talking.</i>

19:06.880 --> 19:08.540
Saranghoe.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.380
It's Han Gyu Hyeok's sister's name.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.500
Han Sa Rang.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.670
Saranghoe.

19:20.290 --> 19:22.530
That bastard is a tough one.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.310
Prosecutor Nam.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.690
How is it going?

19:30.290 --> 19:32.080
The arrest warrant came out.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.700
Where is Han Gyu Hyeok?
Have you found him?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.540
He ran away, but he couldn't
go far.

19:37.540 --> 19:38.970
We're still tracing him.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.580
This... you need to read it first.

19:51.030 --> 19:52.970
It's a completely different pattern.

19:53.690 --> 19:57.160
It looks like Saranghoe has two
different factions.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.460
<i>That's right.</i>

19:58.460 --> 20:01.760
In my opinion, there also must
be two ringleaders.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.330
Prosecutor Nam, what do you think?

20:04.330 --> 20:05.800
It's hard to say.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.740
It's not out of the question,

20:08.740 --> 20:14.610
but since we haven't found Han
Gyu Hyeok, it's best not to
divide our energies.

20:14.610 --> 20:16.810
Is that so?

20:18.280 --> 20:19.380
Well then...

20:19.380 --> 20:21.580
we'll just focus on Han Gyu Hyeok.

20:21.580 --> 20:25.620
The arrest warrant has come out.
Get busy and find him.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.820
I understand.

20:42.870 --> 20:45.070
What's going on?

20:45.070 --> 20:50.580
For now, we have successfully
transferred all suspicion onto
Han Gyu Hyeok.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.610
<i>What have you ever done?</i>

21:01.950 --> 21:05.990
If the outside world finds out
about the investigation of Han
Gyu Hyeok,

21:05.990 --> 21:08.190
our members will surely waver.

21:08.190 --> 21:10.760
Then we will carry out the next
step of the plan.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.600
No.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.170
Before that,

21:15.360 --> 21:17.770
there's something else to do first.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.490
What's going on that you call me
out here all of a sudden?

21:30.770 --> 21:36.120
I'm afraid that there's something
we've overlooked in this case.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.330
The enemy has always been one
step ahead of us.

21:40.490 --> 21:41.590
That means,

21:41.800 --> 21:44.900
our team has an internal leak.

21:44.930 --> 21:46.850
What do you mean by that?

21:47.940 --> 21:51.630
When you were at the hospital
after you had been attacked,

21:51.870 --> 21:54.810
<i>someone appeared there whom
no one had contacted.</i>

21:54.810 --> 21:56.250
So right now,

21:56.640 --> 21:58.480
you suspect Prosecutor Nam?

21:58.480 --> 22:03.160
When I broke into their hideout
after I heard gunshots...

22:05.560 --> 22:07.240
<i>Are you all right?</i>

22:09.120 --> 22:15.290
Prosecutor Nam had the smell
of gunpowder on him.

22:19.030 --> 22:23.070
We're all brothers here, so
there must be mutual trust.

22:23.070 --> 22:24.540
You're overly suspicious.

22:24.540 --> 22:27.060
I can personally vouch for
Prosecutor Nam.

22:29.310 --> 22:33.350
All of this... let's talk about it
again later.

22:33.350 --> 22:34.450
Yes.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.120
Yes, I understand.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.070
Hurry and bring all that.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.340
Hey. Hey. Make sure you don't
drop anything.

22:58.300 --> 23:02.340
<i>An arrest warrant has been issued
for Lawyer Han Gyu Hyeok.</i>

23:02.340 --> 23:05.280
=According to police, Lawyer Han
Gyu Hyeok is on the run.=

23:05.280 --> 23:06.390
Nam Min Su.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.520
That son of a bitch.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.450
=But in several days, he hasn't
used his credit cards or cell phone.=

23:14.450 --> 23:16.290
=The search has encountered
difficulties.=

23:16.290 --> 23:19.230
=Han Gyu Hyeok has now fled
the scene.=

23:19.230 --> 23:25.090
=Police said the entire police
force has been mobilized to hunt
for Han Gyu Hyeok.=

23:35.010 --> 23:37.860
I will never let you have what
you want.

23:38.310 --> 23:39.740
Never.

23:40.510 --> 23:42.350
=Flaunting their distorted view
of justice,=

23:42.350 --> 23:45.190
=the organization that committed
murder is being investigated.=

23:45.220 --> 23:50.230
=Their ringleader was Lawyer
Han Gyu Hyeok, who defended
criminals and won their release,=

23:50.240 --> 23:53.360
=then had them kidnapped and
murdered, a despicable act.=

23:53.360 --> 23:54.830
What are you thinking about?

23:54.830 --> 23:57.030
=Police are searching for Han
Gyu Hyeok.=

23:57.030 --> 23:59.970
Where could Han Gyu Hyeok
have gone?

23:59.970 --> 24:04.370
He has nowhere to go and
nowhere to hide.

24:04.370 --> 24:07.670
Han Gyu Hyeok is running
out of options.

24:07.670 --> 24:10.540
If I were Han Gyu Hyeok, then...

24:13.180 --> 24:15.590
The reason he organized
Saranghoe.

24:16.710 --> 24:18.340
Han Sa Rang.

24:21.990 --> 24:26.120
We can't find one useful clue.

24:27.130 --> 24:32.270
Han Gyu Hyeok and the
Saranghoe members have all
vanished without a trace.

24:32.270 --> 24:36.670
Starting now, everyone be
prepared for a prolonged war.

24:44.010 --> 24:47.680
After we settle this case,

24:47.680 --> 24:51.720
how about our whole team take
a vacation together?

24:51.720 --> 24:54.290
My CD account is about to expire,

24:54.290 --> 24:57.590
so if just the six of us go,
there should be enough.

24:57.590 --> 25:00.630
The sun must have risen in
the West.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.730
I've already figured out your
pattern.

25:02.730 --> 25:06.030
Later on, everyone will have to
pay their share.

25:06.210 --> 25:07.590
Well, believe me this once.

25:07.620 --> 25:10.070
We haven't rested all summer.

25:10.070 --> 25:13.370
We'll rent a nice house on
Jeju Island.

25:13.370 --> 25:17.780
Grill some fish, drink some wine,
wouldn't that be nice?

25:17.780 --> 25:19.630
Sounds good.

25:25.480 --> 25:26.590
I understand.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.300
I'll be right there.

25:28.790 --> 25:31.720
I have to go to headquarters.
Keep working hard.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.130
Wait a moment.

25:37.990 --> 25:39.630
Take care.

25:41.630 --> 25:42.740
Take care!

25:42.740 --> 25:44.200
- See you later.
- Take care!

25:44.200 --> 25:45.570
Drive carefully!

25:56.250 --> 25:57.830
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

25:59.030 --> 26:01.900
I didn't want to come to you
like this.

26:03.100 --> 26:06.240
I didn't want to come see you
when I'm like this.

26:07.690 --> 26:10.260
But things haven't been
finished yet.

26:10.510 --> 26:13.760
I just need a little more time.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.280
Don't be sad.

26:17.820 --> 26:19.960
Just wait a little longer.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.600
How did you know?

26:30.450 --> 26:32.100
Han Gyu Hyeok.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.960
Saranghoe began with this child.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.440
Just what happened?

26:44.030 --> 26:46.800
I'm too ashamed in front of
my sister.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.550
Let's go out.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.330
Sa Rang! Sa Rang!

26:55.950 --> 26:59.870
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!

27:05.620 --> 27:07.030
You...

27:10.340 --> 27:12.610
Ajussi, you're dead.

27:13.710 --> 27:15.450
Just like me.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.000
What are you talking about?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.470
How did I die?

27:21.470 --> 27:22.940
This is strange.

27:22.940 --> 27:26.610
This is the first time it's happened.

28:10.650 --> 28:14.320
<i>Chief Choe! Chief Choe!</i>

29:01.300 --> 29:04.970
How can you all be investigating
this case without headquarters'
knowledge?

29:04.970 --> 29:07.910
Does working independently
mean working without oversight?

29:07.910 --> 29:11.580
Do you think your group is
capable of handling this case?

29:11.580 --> 29:14.880
You must agree the possibility
is very small, right?

29:14.880 --> 29:17.820
With just 5 people, what kind
of investigating can you do?

29:17.820 --> 29:21.850
Don't tell me, are even we
considered suspects?

29:21.850 --> 29:25.160
Are you all finished speaking?

29:25.160 --> 29:28.460
This is a special team of experts
stationed outside headquarters.

29:28.460 --> 29:32.870
Since we don't know to what
extent Saranghoe has spread,

29:32.870 --> 29:36.540
it's possible that one of you is a
member of Saranghoe.

29:36.540 --> 29:39.470
You're right. Since I can't
trust all of you,

29:39.470 --> 29:40.570
that group was formed.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.410
What? Are you finished yet?

29:42.410 --> 29:46.810
I'm not finished talking, so shut
your mouth and listen.

29:47.010 --> 29:49.520
You said just 5 people, right?

29:50.480 --> 29:55.990
During this time, who do you
think has managed to close all
of these cases?

29:55.990 --> 29:59.290
It was those 5 people you're
talking about!

29:59.290 --> 30:06.270
The cases that hundreds of
officers from this office couldn't
solve have been solved!

30:06.630 --> 30:14.710
So don't ever describe my team
as too small.

30:20.580 --> 30:22.780
How nice that everyone is here.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.720
I'm Gang Seong Taek from the
Attorney General's office.

30:25.720 --> 30:30.490
As of now, the prosecutor's
office will take over the
Saranghoe case.

30:30.490 --> 30:34.160
Everyone wants to get their
finger into the pie.

30:34.160 --> 30:38.200
As you know, the prosecutor's
office has been working on this
case.

30:38.200 --> 30:43.340
We don't want to waste the police
force on investigating this.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.740
That is your argument.

30:47.740 --> 30:49.210
Whom do you think you're
talking to?

30:49.210 --> 30:49.940
Shut up.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.780
You can all investigate according
to your methods,

30:51.780 --> 30:54.520
and we will investigate according
to our methods.

30:58.750 --> 31:02.720
If you have a guilty conscience,
ask forgiveness as soon as possible.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.460
Hey!

31:06.460 --> 31:08.660
Forget it.

31:26.280 --> 31:29.210
You once asked me something.

31:29.210 --> 31:33.250
What is better and more
reasonable than justice?

31:33.250 --> 31:37.290
What I believe now is worth
keeping.

31:37.290 --> 31:39.490
What are you trying to say?

31:39.490 --> 31:45.000
So, did you achieve the justice
you desired?

31:46.100 --> 31:50.500
That's enough about morality,
let's cut to the chase.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.710
What is Nam Min Su's objective?

31:52.710 --> 31:56.740
What is he planning?

31:58.940 --> 32:05.920
Min Su believes that executing
just the worst criminals is not
enough.

32:05.920 --> 32:11.060
To change the world, he wants
to uproot even potential evil.

32:11.060 --> 32:15.830
He wanted control of Saranghoe
to achieve that objective.

32:15.830 --> 32:21.330
As long as I was in his way,
he'd do anything to remove me.

32:22.430 --> 32:27.570
Ha Yun eonni figured that out,
so he tried to kill her.

32:47.760 --> 32:51.060
Department Chief!

32:51.060 --> 32:52.160
Prosecutor Nam, why did
you come?

32:52.160 --> 32:54.730
Are you with Nam Min Su now?
Department Chief!

32:54.730 --> 32:56.940
I have important information
regarding Han Gyu Hyeok.

32:56.940 --> 32:58.040
Important information?

32:58.040 --> 32:59.980
Come with me and we'll talk.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.280
Let's go.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.480
We'll talk on the way.

33:09.420 --> 33:10.790
Department Chief!

33:10.890 --> 33:13.820
Would Nam Min Su do something
to Dept. Chief Grandfather?

33:13.990 --> 33:17.860
What? Prosecutor Nam killed
Han Gyu Hyeok?

33:17.860 --> 33:18.960
What are you talking about?

33:18.960 --> 33:20.370
I understand.

33:21.890 --> 33:24.460
Track Department Chief's
phone location right now.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.300
Why are we tracking his
position?

33:26.300 --> 33:28.950
Detective Jeong, what's going on?
What happened?

33:34.740 --> 33:38.040
I found where Han Gyu Hyeok
is hiding.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.280
What? Where he's hiding?

33:41.710 --> 33:43.810
Does our team also know?

33:44.280 --> 33:46.580
No. Not yet.

33:47.220 --> 33:52.720
Anyway, it seems there is an
intelligence leak on the inside.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.190
What do you mean?

33:54.190 --> 33:56.030
We have a spy on our team?

33:56.030 --> 34:01.450
I didn't want to believe it either,
but there's no longer any doubt.

34:02.110 --> 34:06.500
If you miss this chance, it will
be very difficult later.

34:08.710 --> 34:13.230
If we can just arrest Han Gyu
Hyeok, we can find out the whole
story.

34:14.010 --> 34:19.500
If my suspicions are wrong, then
I'll apologize to the team members.

35:05.030 --> 35:06.870
This is the place?

35:06.870 --> 35:09.110
Han Gyu Hyeok is really here?

35:11.940 --> 35:13.500
Prosecutor Nam.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.310
What are you doing?

35:15.500 --> 35:18.290
By now, you should have been
more careful, right?

35:18.610 --> 35:21.050
You still don't understand.

35:33.180 --> 35:34.800
Don't tell me...

35:36.150 --> 35:38.120
Han Gyu Hyeok and you...

35:40.270 --> 35:43.880
Things turned out unfortunately.

35:48.990 --> 35:53.850
I can't believe I fell for this.
I should have realized it sooner.

35:53.940 --> 35:58.250
You offered assistance with the
investigation only to get closer to
our team.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.960
I wanted to find out how much
you knew.

36:01.550 --> 36:04.860
That way we would know who
was a problem, right?

36:04.860 --> 36:06.690
You don't have to do this.

36:06.690 --> 36:08.660
I'm sorry, Department Chief
Gang.

36:24.310 --> 36:27.720
Do you really think they won't
find all of you?

36:27.980 --> 36:30.920
Once they catch Han Gyu Hyeok,
it's also over for you.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.920
That's not going to happen.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.670
You even killed Han Gyu Hyeok?

36:53.760 --> 36:56.390
I had no other choice.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.960
But people will remember a
different scenario here.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.850
You killed Han Gyu Hyeok.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.930
And Gyu Hyeok killed you.

37:09.020 --> 37:13.370
Just like that, the Saranghoe
case will be closed.

37:14.590 --> 37:18.740
Nam... Min Su.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.670
You think you'll get away with this?

37:22.730 --> 37:25.380
Department Chief, you'll become
a hero.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.790
You don't need to worry about
anything.

38:34.970 --> 38:36.440
Yes, seonbaenim.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.910
Where is the correct location?

38:37.910 --> 38:41.210
In Sangil-dong, near #34-1.

38:41.210 --> 38:42.520
Okay.

38:54.990 --> 38:58.490
From now on, no one will stand
in your way.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.240
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

39:03.300 --> 39:04.900
<i>Why give up the appeal?</i>

39:04.920 --> 39:07.640
<i>You should realize it's pointless!</i>

39:07.640 --> 39:08.740
<i>I'm confident.</i>

39:08.790 --> 39:09.980
<i>With more evidence...</i>

39:09.990 --> 39:12.040
<i>Where is there more evidence?</i>

39:12.040 --> 39:15.510
<i>A Chajin Group son,
plus Han Gyu Hyeok.</i>

39:15.710 --> 39:17.920
<i>You can see how it will turn out!</i>

39:17.920 --> 39:22.900
<i>Should I investigate only
according to the opponent?</i>

39:26.380 --> 39:28.020
<i>Han Gyu Hyeok!</i>

39:29.660 --> 39:33.330
<i>You worked so hard to become a
lawyer to do things like this?</i>

39:33.500 --> 39:35.920
<i>Was it just because of money?</i>

40:11.140 --> 40:13.710
<i>Boss, what should we do?</i>

40:13.710 --> 40:15.500
<i>Don't worry about him.</i>

40:39.920 --> 40:41.520
<i>What is this?</i>

40:42.070 --> 40:44.360
<i>What are you doing?</i>

40:46.290 --> 40:49.350
<i>Haven't you figured out how
to catch them?</i>

41:01.790 --> 41:07.290
<i>The man who did this, Ju Man Bok,
got out of prison and committed
the same crime.</i>

41:07.410 --> 41:09.650
<i>So I killed him.</i>

41:11.330 --> 41:16.470
<i>After killing Ju Man Bok,
I began to see more clearly.</i>

41:16.470 --> 41:21.610
<i>Just like me, the victims felt grief
and injustice, so did the family.</i>

41:21.610 --> 41:24.630
<i>Dura lex, sed lex.
[The law is hard, but it is the law.]</i>

41:25.690 --> 41:28.880
<i>Remember how our professor
raised that issue before?</i>

41:30.050 --> 41:34.090
<i>For the sake of order, even a
draconian law must be followed.</i>

41:34.090 --> 41:38.490
<i>If it were like this back then,
would you give the same answer?</i>

41:38.490 --> 41:43.630
<i>There is no hope with the law
anymore.</i>

41:51.340 --> 41:53.540
<i>Look at your options.</i>

41:53.710 --> 41:56.210
<i>Either put me in handcuffs,</i>

41:56.660 --> 41:59.280
<i>or else take my hand.</i>

42:05.650 --> 42:08.590
<i>As of now, my word is justice
and the law. </i>

42:08.590 --> 42:10.440
<i>Nam Min Su!</i>

42:10.790 --> 42:15.660
<i>From this day on, Saranghoe will
be reborn.</i>

42:24.740 --> 42:26.570
Has everything been prepared?

42:26.570 --> 42:27.760
Yes.

42:29.140 --> 42:31.500
It's time.

42:48.230 --> 42:51.320
Department Chief!

43:02.540 --> 43:04.010
-=Gang Gi Yeong=-

43:07.480 --> 43:09.020
Yun Cheo Yong!

43:16.860 --> 43:17.960
This is his wallet!

43:17.960 --> 43:21.260
<i>Department Chief grandfather!</i>

43:21.260 --> 43:23.090
Department Chief.

43:23.090 --> 43:25.300
It can't be! This must be a
mistake, right?

43:25.300 --> 43:27.130
Yun Cheo Yong!

43:27.130 --> 43:30.440
Why don't you say something?

43:30.440 --> 43:34.050
Nam Min Su, that bastard.
I'm going to kill him.

43:35.570 --> 43:38.880
Seonbae, what are we going
to do?

43:38.880 --> 43:41.310
What can I do about it, kid?

43:44.020 --> 43:49.280
Nam Min Su, that bastard!
I will catch him for sure.

43:49.890 --> 43:53.190
No matter how, we're going to
arrest him! Then I will kill him!

43:53.190 --> 43:55.800
That's what we're going to do!

43:55.930 --> 43:57.380
What are you waiting for?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.670
Get yourselves together!

44:03.660 --> 44:06.040
Department Chief!

44:07.140 --> 44:08.610
It hurts!

44:11.920 --> 44:13.360
Department Chief!

44:16.080 --> 44:17.420
<i>What?</i>

44:17.420 --> 44:19.250
What's going on?

44:19.250 --> 44:20.350
Department Chief!

44:20.350 --> 44:22.190
Why do you all look like
you're in a daze?

44:22.190 --> 44:24.390
Did you all turn into zombies?

44:24.390 --> 44:28.430
Ah, Elder, seriously!

44:28.430 --> 44:33.200
Jong Hyeon, that hurts!
My leg! My leg!

44:35.030 --> 44:36.130
Did someone die?

44:36.130 --> 44:37.970
What's wrong with your eyes?

44:37.970 --> 44:39.440
Are you okay?

44:39.440 --> 44:40.910
I'm just fine.

44:40.910 --> 44:43.480
It's just a scratch.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.040
What happened?

44:46.040 --> 44:51.920
I recorded everything.
Just play this back.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.770
But, you must be wondering.

45:19.810 --> 45:21.280
<i>It's time to wear this.</i>

45:21.280 --> 45:24.220
<i>You don't know how or when
they might attack you. </i>

45:24.220 --> 45:27.890
<i>No, it's awkward, and heavy.</i>

45:27.890 --> 45:30.940
<i>It will make me look fat.</i>

45:33.390 --> 45:35.960
Oh, seriously!

45:35.960 --> 45:38.530
Why did you have to drop this?

45:38.530 --> 45:40.730
Thanks to Detective Jeong,
I survived.

45:43.300 --> 45:48.440
I also had guessed that,
so I prepared this.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.380
Grandfather is alive,
and still bragging.

45:51.380 --> 45:55.410
Okay. We've got the evidence.
We just need to catch him now.

45:55.410 --> 45:59.450
Yes. Until we know where he's
gone, we must proceed carefully.

45:59.450 --> 46:02.750
Okay, tonight! Surprise attack.

46:02.750 --> 46:03.860
What do you mean?

46:03.860 --> 46:09.760
I mean, tonight Nam Min Su will
gather his members to plan
something.

46:11.020 --> 46:13.320
<i>All of the members have
gathered.</i>

46:14.290 --> 46:17.860
Then, they'll probably start up
their executions again?

46:18.020 --> 46:20.450
Okay! Let's go get that bastard.

46:22.570 --> 46:26.150
Department Chief, but where
do we go?

46:27.180 --> 46:28.810
I was wrong.

46:28.810 --> 46:30.650
I was very wrong.

46:30.650 --> 46:33.220
What did you do wrong?

46:33.220 --> 46:34.690
Tell us, you little jerk.

46:34.690 --> 46:39.090
What did you do wrong?

46:39.820 --> 46:41.660
<i>Hey, let's just go. </i>

46:41.660 --> 46:43.490
That's no fun.

46:43.490 --> 46:47.170
Did you... want to kill Jong Min
for doing that?

46:47.170 --> 46:50.840
Don't worry, he's a dead man
anyway.

46:50.840 --> 46:52.670
That bastard.

46:52.670 --> 46:55.970
Okay, let's go.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.480
<i>You once asked me something.</i>

47:01.480 --> 47:05.520
<i>What is better and more
reasonable than justice?</i>

47:05.520 --> 47:12.490
<i>It's worth protecting the way
things will be 10 years from now.</i>

47:23.500 --> 47:25.340
Nam Min Su's phone has been
turned off.

47:25.340 --> 47:27.170
All of the Saranghoe members,
as well.

47:27.170 --> 47:31.580
What should we do? There's no
other way to track them.

47:31.580 --> 47:34.510
There is a way.

47:34.510 --> 47:37.820
Who knows Nam Min Su best?

47:37.870 --> 47:39.770
Han Gyu Hyeok?

47:44.840 --> 47:46.730
Ajussi.

47:56.900 --> 47:59.100
I'll help you, Detective Yun.

47:59.230 --> 48:01.310
But I have one request.

48:01.310 --> 48:05.340
Please protect the members of
Saranghoe who believed in me.

48:05.340 --> 48:07.550
They aren't guilty of anything.

48:07.550 --> 48:11.220
They can't avoid paying for
their crimes.

48:11.220 --> 48:15.990
But, we can stop them from
becoming monsters.

48:15.990 --> 48:23.330
That is my promise to you,
so help us as best you can.

48:33.600 --> 48:38.010
<i>I hid all the information we
collected underneath Sa Rang's bed.</i>

48:38.010 --> 48:42.410
<i>Inside is everything about
Nam Min Su.</i>

48:46.820 --> 48:50.490
It wasn't only Han Gyu Hyeok.
Even Nam Min Su committed
kidnapping and murder.

48:50.490 --> 48:53.060
All the details are recorded here.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.730
Based on this information, can
we immediately apply for an
arrest warrant?

48:56.730 --> 48:59.300
Look in there for anything
relating to Nam Min Su.

48:59.300 --> 49:02.970
It looks like Nam Min Su tried to
buy a building a few months ago.

49:02.970 --> 49:04.970
There's a document here.

49:13.130 --> 49:14.610
Yes, Team leader.

49:14.900 --> 49:16.930
Okay, I got it.

49:19.120 --> 49:23.150
We have intelligence that Nam
Min Su tried to buy a building in
Seongdong.

49:23.150 --> 49:26.820
Whether Nam Min Su or any of
the Saranghoe members have a
building,

49:26.820 --> 49:27.930
we need to find out quickly.

49:28.020 --> 49:29.310
Okay.

49:30.500 --> 49:33.060
There is a closed former church
building there.

49:33.060 --> 49:36.730
Recently, a Saranghoe member
named Choe Myeong Seok
purchased it.

49:36.730 --> 49:41.870
Okay. Let Detective Yun know
immediately.

49:42.610 --> 49:43.710
Let's get going.

49:43.710 --> 49:45.540
<i>Yes.</i>

49:54.350 --> 49:55.820
Seongdong?

49:55.820 --> 49:58.390
Is that where evil cults belong?

49:58.390 --> 50:00.220
How long will it take to get there?

50:00.220 --> 50:02.430
About 10 minutes.

50:40.230 --> 50:48.040
It breaks my heart to have to
give all of you this news.

50:50.140 --> 50:56.050
Lawyer Han Gyu Hyeok, our
former chairman of Saranghoe,

50:56.380 --> 51:02.500
was brutally killed at the hands
of the police.

51:07.850 --> 51:10.720
I can understand how sad you
all feel.

51:11.430 --> 51:17.980
Just like all of you, I came here
because I believed as he did.

51:19.140 --> 51:21.710
Gyu Hyeok may have gone
ahead of us,

51:21.710 --> 51:26.480
but his spirit is still alive
in our midst.

51:26.480 --> 51:34.920
The true justice that he died
trying to achieve is now in our
hands.

51:34.920 --> 51:40.060
If I fall, someone else will
go on in my place.

51:40.060 --> 51:43.360
Then here there will be someone
to guard the noble spirit of justice.

51:43.360 --> 51:50.330
Our Saranghoe will last forever.

51:56.210 --> 51:58.410
I was wrong! Please spare me!

51:59.510 --> 52:01.710
Spare me! Please spare me!

52:01.710 --> 52:03.920
Wait, aren't those just kids?

52:03.920 --> 52:07.590
Isn't this too much?

52:09.790 --> 52:13.820
These kids were bullying their
classmate and their appetite for
violence is growing.

52:13.820 --> 52:16.390
They forced one child to eat his
own excrement,

52:16.390 --> 52:20.430
causing that classmate to commit
suicide.

52:20.430 --> 52:21.530
What is going on here?

52:21.530 --> 52:25.570
No matter what, how can we
kill children?

52:29.240 --> 52:34.750
Just because they're young,
will you forgive what they've done?

52:34.750 --> 52:39.880
If we release them, they will rob
someone, assault someone,
rape someone!

52:39.880 --> 52:44.660
Eventually they will kill.

52:51.630 --> 52:55.300
In order to prevent an innocent
sacrifice like that,

52:55.300 --> 52:59.700
executing potential criminals like
this, potential murderers,

52:59.700 --> 53:07.410
is our future and our mission to
uphold justice.

53:09.980 --> 53:12.550
I will not force you.

53:12.550 --> 53:20.260
Those who willingly agree with
my goals, please stand up.

53:38.980 --> 53:41.180
The SWAT team will go in from
the front.

53:41.180 --> 53:43.380
Tae Gyeong in addition to
Team 1.

53:43.380 --> 53:44.480
What's the situation on the
inside?

53:44.480 --> 53:47.790
Nam Min Su is preparing to
execute some students.

53:47.790 --> 53:51.090
That bastard! He's a completely
hardcore maniac!

53:51.090 --> 53:54.390
We don't have much time.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.630
<i>Don't move or we'll shoot!</i>

54:00.630 --> 54:02.100
<i>Don't come any closer!</i>

54:04.300 --> 54:09.440
Forget the others and just
catch Nam Min Su.

54:12.380 --> 54:14.790
The police are here!
Everybody run!

54:15.310 --> 54:17.200
We have to go now.

54:44.510 --> 54:46.170
Quiet!

54:46.710 --> 54:49.940
All of you have been deceived
by Nam Min Su!

54:57.150 --> 55:00.460
=Once they catch Han Gyu Hyeok,
it's also over for you.=

55:00.460 --> 55:02.120
=That's not going to happen.=

55:02.660 --> 55:05.230
=You even killed Han Gyu Hyeok?=

55:05.330 --> 55:07.750
=I had no other choice.=

55:07.990 --> 55:10.740
=But people will remember a
different scenario here.=

55:10.850 --> 55:12.940
=You killed Han Gyu Hyeok.=

55:12.940 --> 55:15.140
=And Gyu Hyeok killed you.=

55:15.140 --> 55:18.990
=Just like that, the Saranghoe
case will be closed.=

55:22.110 --> 55:29.450
Nam Min Su, in order to take
control of Saranghoe, killed Han
Gyu Hyeok.

55:29.450 --> 55:31.290
Is this what he would have
wanted?

55:31.290 --> 55:32.480
No!

55:33.950 --> 55:35.870
Don't believe him.

55:36.430 --> 55:39.050
Is it true Nam Min Su killed the
chairman?

55:39.730 --> 55:41.570
<i>Tell us! Tell us!</i>

55:48.170 --> 55:50.850
Everything should be over
by now.

56:23.770 --> 56:25.810
Please find a place to hide.

56:36.990 --> 56:39.190
Eonni, look out!

56:57.910 --> 56:59.010
Are you all right?

56:59.010 --> 57:01.210
I'm okay.

57:01.210 --> 57:03.410
Detective Jeong!

57:03.410 --> 57:04.880
Keep an eye on him.

57:04.880 --> 57:06.170
Yes.

58:04.980 --> 58:06.560
Stop!

58:10.720 --> 58:12.110
Stop!

58:25.890 --> 58:27.780
Drop the gun.

58:28.200 --> 58:31.140
Saranghoe and you,
it's all over.

58:31.140 --> 58:32.240
Drop the gun!

58:32.240 --> 58:34.810
Who says it's finished?

58:34.810 --> 58:36.640
Just wait and see.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.580
It wasn't easy for me to get here.

58:39.580 --> 58:41.410
I still have a lot of things to do!

58:41.410 --> 58:46.920
Killing innocent people is what
you call justice?

58:46.920 --> 58:49.490
You're saying I've killed innocent
people?

58:49.490 --> 58:52.420
They were all trash.

58:52.420 --> 58:59.400
The darkness that exists in a
decaying society that only brings
sadness and pain!

58:59.400 --> 59:01.970
Nam Min Su!

59:04.170 --> 59:06.000
Surrender!

59:06.000 --> 59:08.570
Give it up now, Nam Min Su!

59:24.720 --> 59:31.330
Do you think that if I die,
everything will end?

59:31.330 --> 59:39.040
Until things change in this rotten
country... it will never be over.

59:39.040 --> 59:43.980
Eventually, someone else will
come along...

59:47.320 --> 59:49.390
who thinks the same way.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:57.580
<i>The implementation of cruel
murders as a means of achieving
social justice.</i>

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.350
<i>The members of the illegal
organization known as Saranghoe
were arrested last night.</i>

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.020
<i>The power behind these events
was Lawyer Han Gyu Hyeok and
Prosecutor Nam Min Su.</i>

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.230
<i>Both are confirmed as dead.</i>

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:13.730
<i>Those with a criminal record of
murder, rape, robbery, and other
serious crimes, </i>

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.930
<i>were kidnapped, tortured, and
then murdered.</i>

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.500
<i>The people involved in these
criminal acts have been confirmed </i>

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.640
<i>as those affected by crimes,
either spouse or family members
of victims,</i>

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.840
<i>so the impact was even greater.</i>

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.400
Anyway, we settled the case,
but I don't feel very good.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.650
You can still get sick?

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:37.030
It's not like that.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:40.520
But if so many people would
follow someone like that,

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.300
than what Han Gyu Hyeok ajussi
said might not be completely
wrong.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.230
Justice is pretty much learned
in kindergarten.

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:53.000
The problem starts when people
begin to feel comfortable with
what they know is wrong.

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:54.380
Is that it?

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:57.670
Justice.

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:00.710
How to achieve it?

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:03.280
How much punishment for how
many crimes?

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.050
And authority to enforce the law
independently.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:15.030
Without such a basis, groups
like Saranghoe will exist.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:19.370
If it fails, then the same thing
can happen again.

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.910
I hope Detective Yun, you will
protect that justice.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.970
Thank you.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:33.380
And, keep working hard.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.770
<i>This is nice.</i>

01:02:55.770 --> 01:03:02.370
The sky is clear and sunny,
and the sound of waves is nice.

01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:06.040
What the heck is this? There's
no charcoal. No charcoal.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.980
As soon as I heard you say
Jeju Island, I just knew it.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.440
Is this Jeju Island?

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.110
This isn't even a resort!

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.870
Department Chief, if it was going
to be like this, we should have
stayed at home!

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.520
There's no place better than this.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:24.390
Yeah, it's great! Really great!

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:26.960
Old man wearing shorts.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.630
Department Chief, put on some
clothes so you don't catch cold!

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.940
Our rooftop.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.770
It doesn't look too bad decorated
like this.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.610
You're here.

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.180
You caught me.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.850
Aigoo. It's not so bad.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:49.350
Put on your swim goggles
and go soak in there.

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:50.820
Go soak in there.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.120
It's not blown up yet?

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:59.260
Uncle Guk Jin is playful.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.470
How long does this take to fill?

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:04.770
<i>This is what I should do.</i>

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:07.340
Waiting is over, the chicken
is here!

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.380
Decorated like this, I should just
go back home!

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.310
Ha Yun eonni looks really
pretty today!

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:16.510
Tae Gyeong oppa is totally my
style.

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:17.610
Here.

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:20.180
Please help yourselves.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.120
Everyone enjoy.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:26.790
When hanging out here, eating
fried chicken is the best.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.730
Detective Lee, you seem like
you're enjoying yourself.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.580
Nice catch.

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.170
Give me some tissue.

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:39.640
Okay.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.570
It can fly.

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:45.140
I can't get used to this.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.450
What a perfect vacation,
to be on the office rooftop.

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:51.750
And spending it being haunted
by the ghost of a high school girl!

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.320
Let's all take a group photo.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.250
<i>Sure, let's take a picture.</i>

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.290
=What is your status?
What is your status?=

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:04.590
=32-7. Report of gang violence.=

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:07.500
32-7 is our region.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.960
Didn't you hear a status call?

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:15.610
Get going!

01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:18.540
Yes, let's go!
