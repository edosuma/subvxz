WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:06.507
Don't lie to me, Phillip!
I'm not lying!

00:06.540 --> 00:09.543
Then tell me who she is!
I told you. Nobody.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.813
So that thing in your glove
compartment is nobody's?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.815
Honey, please get in the car.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.218
Come on. This is dangerous.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.721
I will get back in your car
when you are honest with me.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.065
Get out of the
road, dumbass!

00:32.100 --> 00:33.801
Okay, okay.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.170
The truth?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.506
It's Shelley's.
Shelley?!

00:38.539 --> 00:40.074
Honey. Honey, please.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.475
Oh.
Just-just breathe.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.843
I can explain. Just-just get

00:42.876 --> 00:45.213
in the car. Rachel?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.814
Rachel!

00:46.847 --> 00:49.417
What did you do?!

00:52.186 --> 00:53.721
Ugh! Typical!

00:53.754 --> 00:55.156
Where are you going?

00:55.189 --> 00:56.857
Come-come back.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.160
You know how much
I paid for that ring?

00:59.193 --> 01:01.162
Please help me find it.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.403
That guy was right.
You are a dumbass.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.806
See, this is mine.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.645
This... is yours.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.149
Bye.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.718
Psycho bitch!

01:31.159 --> 01:33.561
*

02:06.394 --> 02:09.263
Kayla?

02:11.565 --> 02:14.635
Hey, Dad.

02:14.668 --> 02:18.639
Breakfast?
Uh-uh. I'm meeting
Agent Gibbs at the diner.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.209
Mm. What? I had
your shake yesterday

02:21.242 --> 02:22.743
and the day before that.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.313
Sometimes I prefer
to eat my meal, not sip it.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.248
Diner food isn't a meal.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.417
I can remember
you used to eat Fruity Pebbles

02:29.450 --> 02:31.285
every morning
for about a year.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.954
Yeah, well, things change.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.723
They certainly do.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.259
Geez.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.893
I got a ride to school.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.429
From whom?
Mandy.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.830
Uh-huh.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.466
Dad, that's enough.
Didn't say anything.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.436
I can hear your inner voice.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.838
Inner voice. All right.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.308
Yo, ready?

02:54.342 --> 02:55.843
Need my backpack.
30 seconds.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.982
Mandy.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.184
Mr. V.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.490
So, how's cheerleading going?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.359
Whatever. Kind of over it.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.227
Ah, like ballet.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.395
No, it's cool.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.231
More time to study.
Study?

03:17.265 --> 03:19.533
Told me you were putting your
senior year on cruise control.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.569
Thinking about college.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.904
Kayla's helping me
with applications.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.275
Really? I didn't know that.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.411
Sorry. Let's go.
Bye, Dad.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.012
He didn't talk
to you, did he?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.547
Unfortunately.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.218
Right, all right, all right.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.722
Gibbs.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.023
I'll see you in 20?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.859
No. Can't, Leon.
I got to cancel.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.761
Sorry.
Not as sorry as I am.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.630
You okay?

03:49.663 --> 03:51.932
Uh, no. No,
not really.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.934
I'm standing here
looking at a dead Marine.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.269
Later, Leon.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.372
Marine Lance Corporal
Scott Jenkins,

03:58.406 --> 04:00.341
26, stationed out of Quantico.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.842
Give me a time
of death, Palmer.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.711
Well, there's not much
decay or bloating.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.313
Based on liver temperature,

04:05.346 --> 04:07.848
I'd say he died
between seven, eight hours ago.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.983
The middle of the night.
Makes sense.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.053
His C.O. said Corporal Jenkins
trained in the wee hours.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.855
Called him "the
Midnight Marathoner."

04:14.888 --> 04:17.491
He was in the water.
How'd he get in the water?

04:17.525 --> 04:19.327
He had help.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.394
Take a look.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.296
I'm gonna go help Bishop.

04:22.330 --> 04:26.066
Massive, recent
blunt force trauma.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.501
He was hit
by something large.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.036
Like a car?

04:29.069 --> 04:31.972
I found some broken plastic
and-and glass.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.841
Headlight?
That's what
I'm thinking.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.344
No skid marks.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.379
Thought jogging was supposed
to be good for you.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.050
I'm, uh, really quite funny
when you get to know me,

04:43.083 --> 04:46.587
Agent...
I'll take your word for it.
How'd you discover the body?

04:46.620 --> 04:51.725
Right. So, I pulled over so
I could have a discussion

04:51.759 --> 04:53.394
with my friend.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.597
Saw the guy floating,
called 911 right away.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.399
Where's your car now?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.601
My friend had to go
to work. So, you have

05:00.634 --> 05:04.472
a business card in case I
remember any other details?

05:04.505 --> 05:05.839
No.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.341
We got something.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.677
Found it in the bushes.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.745
Yeah, that's, uh...

05:11.779 --> 05:13.947
It's actually mine.

05:16.617 --> 05:17.985
Okay.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.521
Here's where we found
the broken headlight.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.122
That's the impact point.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.958
And the body was floating
here at the discovery point,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.360
52 feet between them.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.028
McGEE:
Based on Corporal Jenkins'

05:28.061 --> 05:30.130
weight and the distance
he flew upon impact,

05:30.163 --> 05:31.799
we think the vehicle
was traveling

05:31.832 --> 05:33.401
about 60 miles
an hour.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.935
It was foggy last night.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.870
And that part of Route 73 is

05:36.904 --> 05:39.373
in a valley
that's a microclimate for mist.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.476
Corporal Jenkins had reflective
clothing on, but even

05:42.510 --> 05:45.379
in the fog, how do you plow
into someone and not slow down?

05:45.413 --> 05:46.680
Yeah, or just stop.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.948
VANCE:
Gibbs?

05:47.981 --> 05:50.384
Walk with me.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.558
Everything okay?

05:57.591 --> 05:59.092
No.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.498
Kayla's been arrested.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.710
Okay, there's your head,
so, you know this, Jimmy.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.579
You know this.
You've got it.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.849
All right,
the automatic doors should be...

06:21.882 --> 06:23.884
right... here.

06:23.917 --> 06:24.918
Ow.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.022
Doctor.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.058
Uh. Hello, Gibbs.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.026
What the hell
are you doing, Palmer?

06:33.060 --> 06:36.029
I was just headed out
to the eye wash.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.065
I accidentally got some glass
in my eyes.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.867
Ah, geez.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.702
Yeah, our victim has
these little pieces

06:41.735 --> 06:43.937
of plastic and glass
embedded in his hip.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.806
Follow me.
All right. So I was trying

06:45.839 --> 06:47.708
to extract all the
shards for Abby

06:47.741 --> 06:49.910
'cause she's trying
to ID the vehicle.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.212
Oh. Oh, there we go.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.914
That's it.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.649
Water is good.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.551
That should do the trick.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.119
Oh, thank you.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.154
Oh. Now, look here, look here.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.857
You see anything? Uh...

07:03.891 --> 07:06.994
Your soul.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.863
I believe you.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.999
Cause of death?
Well, his lungs

07:12.032 --> 07:14.835
were filled with water,
so, official cause of death

07:14.868 --> 07:17.004
was drowning, but I got to say,

07:17.037 --> 07:20.140
there was catastrophic damage
to his internal organs, so,

07:20.173 --> 07:23.544
he was not long
for this earth.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.515
Oh, wow, Abby,
that looks great.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.983
Stop. Don't move.
:
What is it?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.519
:
You don't have to whisper.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.986
I'm just saying
the slightest vibration

07:33.020 --> 07:35.122
could make Humpty Dumpty
come crashing down.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.024
Oh, you put it
back together.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.594
Yup, without all the king's
horses and all the king's men.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.063
It was just girl power.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.865
Are you able to ID
the types of vehicles

07:44.898 --> 07:46.534
that use this
style of headlight?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.602
Not vehicles. Vehicle.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.070
I know the make,
model and the year.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.741
It never said
that he was an egg.
What?

07:53.774 --> 07:55.643
The nursery rhyme.
Humpty Dumpty.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.611
Never said he was an egg.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.582
Oh, wow. You're right.
Yeah.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.685
So, you are
looking for a blue

08:04.718 --> 08:07.988
2013 Maserati GranTurismo.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.256
How do you know
it's blue?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.524
Not just blue.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.094
Blu Nettuno.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.665
Lance Corporal Jenkins-- he
ran with music on his hip.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.633
And see that little splash
of blue right there?

08:19.667 --> 08:22.002
Paint from the car
that hit him.
Yeah. I used

08:22.035 --> 08:24.972
my spectrophotometer
to identify the pigment.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.008
Oh, it's a rare car.
Can't be more than a handful.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.078
Actually, there's only
three in the tristate area,

08:31.111 --> 08:35.816
and I have the names and the
addresses of all the owners.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.019
One of 'em lives just
a few miles from the accident.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.954
Abby, you're a godsend.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.092
Hey!

08:53.667 --> 08:56.069
It's a blue Maserati.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.739
But you can't see
the headlights.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.110
You know who would look good
in a Maserati?
Hmm?

09:03.143 --> 09:06.914
Luis.
Luis? Like your
undercover alter ego?

09:06.947 --> 09:09.349
Yeah, you know,
windows down, music blaring,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.084
hundred on the freeway.
Oh.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.221
Charlie by his side.
Ooh! I'm there, too, huh?

09:14.254 --> 09:16.990
Yeah, you know, Charlie and
Luis are a couple, you know?

09:17.024 --> 09:19.159
Hmm.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.796
You hear that?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.264
Smoke alarm.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.967
Where there's smoke...

09:39.279 --> 09:41.114
Take him.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.125
Well,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.995
looks like it was gonna be
barbecue chicken pizza.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.264
Is he alive?
Yeah.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.833
And wasted.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.635
John Kendall.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.271
Hey! Wake up!

10:06.840 --> 10:10.143
All right, you two chat.
I'll going to the garage.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.697
Bingo.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.669
Director.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.037
Detective.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.071
Sorry about this.
What happened?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.874
Well, mall security
detained her for shoplifting.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.376
Are they absolutely certain?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.979
She had the merchandise
in her possession. A purse.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.848
And she admitted it.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.349
Look, the store owner
wants to prosecute,

10:49.382 --> 10:52.152
so we had to pick her up.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.922
She off school today?

10:54.955 --> 10:56.256
No.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.125
She never mentioned

10:58.158 --> 11:00.227
that she was your daughter,
Director Vance.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.195
If she had, maybe...

11:02.229 --> 11:05.132
How old is Kayla?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.433
She's 17.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.468
That's better than 18.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.214
You okay?

11:21.248 --> 11:23.116
Mm-hmm.
What happened?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.124
Kayla, what the hell happened?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.259
I made a mistake.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.761
No.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.829
A mistake is when you step
on the accelerator

11:35.863 --> 11:37.097
instead of the brake.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.331
You made a bad choice.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.133
A bad choice. I know, Dad.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.435
Where's Mandy?
Was she involved in this?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.137
No, Dad.
Can we just go to school?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.239
I'm missing chemistry.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.149
Well, you rolled big
last night, Mr. Kendall.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.752
Found this, uh,
credit card receipt

11:58.786 --> 12:00.153
in your wallet.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.123
Bar tab for $120.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.491
Wow.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.259
So, what's your drink of choice?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.762
Whiskey Tequila?

12:08.796 --> 12:10.063
Yes.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.432
Honesty.
That's what we like in here.

12:12.465 --> 12:16.069
So, while we're
being truthful...

12:16.103 --> 12:18.772
how many drinks you think
you knocked back last night?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.074
A dozen? Give or take.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.376
12 drinks in one night.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.212
That's enough to kill someone.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.247
It did.
Hmm.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.149
John Kendall.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.351
Accountant.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.254
One, two, three DUI arrests

12:34.287 --> 12:35.088
in the past eight years.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.090
I mean, how is this guy
still allowed

12:37.124 --> 12:38.325
to be behind the wheel?

12:38.358 --> 12:41.094
A Marine marathoner is dead,

12:41.128 --> 12:43.563
and the town drunk
is very much alive and kicking.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.133
Life isn't fair.
Hmm.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.435
Why don't you tell me about
your drive home last night?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.003
From the bar.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.171
I didn't drive.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.306
Your car says otherwise.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.209
Maserati was in an accident
last night.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.046
But I took a cab.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.180
Sure about that?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.449
Yes. I'm-I'm pretty sure.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.084
I mean, I-I think so.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.920
Wait, please tell me
my car is okay.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.858
Well, it's not really your car
you have to worry about.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.360
This is very me.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.428
I need more powder.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.967
And black light.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.871
Okay, this is a problem.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.372
There's no fingerprints.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.307
On the steering wheel?
On the steering wheel,

13:27.340 --> 13:29.076
on the dashboard, the door,

13:29.109 --> 13:32.045
the GPS touch screen. Nowhere.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.848
Wiped clean?
Why would Kendall wipe
clean his own car?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.516
What?!

13:36.549 --> 13:38.518
Personalized floor mats?
Come on.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.220
They think of everything.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.856
Wait, look at this.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.925
I found a bracelet.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.226
Is Kendall married?

13:46.259 --> 13:49.262
Divorced. No kids.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.968
Is this a Breathalyzer?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.236
Yeah.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.039
It's an ignition
interlock device.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.308
The court mandates these
for DUI offenders.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
You need to blow into here
before you drive,

14:03.210 --> 14:05.012
and if it detects alcohol,

14:05.045 --> 14:06.346
then your car won't start.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.248
Kendall was drunk
the night of the accident.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.617
Then he wasn't
driving this car.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.852
So he's not our killer.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.197
So, where are we?
Uh, well, Kendall's car

14:24.231 --> 14:25.632
killed Corporal Jenkins.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.434
TORRES:
Abby matched the blood spatter

14:27.467 --> 14:28.668
on the car's
grill to Jenkins.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.537
Yeah, only Kendall
wasn't driving.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.305
Couldn't have.
The car's equipped

14:32.339 --> 14:34.574
with an ignition
interlock device.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.243
You have to be sober
to start it.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.278
Kendall taxied
to the bar last night.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.447
Left his car in the garage,
which he says was open.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.614
Left his keys

14:41.648 --> 14:43.216
in the cupholder.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.052
We figure someone walked
into Kendall's garage

14:45.085 --> 14:46.219
and took his car.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.921
Who, McGee?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.624
A pirate?

14:51.658 --> 14:54.494
Actually, it's a marauder.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.197
It's like a land pirate.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.365
TORRES:
That's the image

14:58.398 --> 15:00.067
on the bracelet I found
in the Maserati.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.368
It's a mascot

15:01.401 --> 15:02.702
from a high school
near the accident site.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.671
The Mid-County Marauders.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.638
The bracelets

15:05.672 --> 15:08.041
are worn by the students
to show school spirit.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.044
So, what, now we have
2,000 teenage suspects?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.412
Actually, only two.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.613
The initials GLB

15:13.646 --> 15:16.083
are engraved on the inside.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.350
According to
the high school directory,

15:17.384 --> 15:18.685
there's only two students
with the initials

15:18.718 --> 15:21.254
GLB. Only one is female.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.522
Genevieve Lynn Bell.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.690
BISHOP:
15 years old.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.592
Sophomore. Very active

15:25.625 --> 15:26.659
on social media.
She posted this pic

15:26.693 --> 15:28.395
at 9:09 last night.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.562
And that's her on the right.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.697
Who's the other girl?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.265
TORRES:
I can ask Genevieve.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.433
I got her address.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.701
School's out,
she should be home.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.403
Go. Take McGee. Bishop.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.271
Uh, car has GPS.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.107
I'm using it to trace
where it went that night.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.677
Whoa.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.080
Isn't that Beethoven's Fifth?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.282
Really, bro?
You're asking me?

15:54.654 --> 15:57.190
Hi. Mrs. Bell?
Yes.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.626
NCIS Special Agents
McGee and Torres.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.462
We're, uh, looking for
your daughter Genevieve.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.763
She's at school.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.299
Mid
Isn't it out for the day?

16:06.333 --> 16:08.268
She stays late
for volleyball practice.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.636
What's this about?

16:09.669 --> 16:10.770
We believe she was a witness

16:10.803 --> 16:12.605
to a fatal car
accident last night.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.175
She was what?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.643
Well, there's no reason
to be alarmed, Mrs. Bell.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.511
No reason to be alarmed?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.613
You just said that my daughter
saw someone die.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.715
Well, we're not exactly sure
what she saw,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.351
which is why we want
to speak with her.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.653
I'm gonna call her right now.
Yeah, go.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.621
Uh, did she ever leave
the house last night?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.657
She was at a sleepover.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.725
With this girl?

16:32.759 --> 16:35.495
Maya Guzman.
Uh, she was at her house.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.064
She's not answering.
I'm gonna try her again.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.632
Does this bracelet belong
to Genevieve?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.701
How did you get that?

16:43.236 --> 16:46.039
It was in the car involved
in the accident last night.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.440
Oh, my God.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.741
Conrad, take a break.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.311
Sorry. I'm a music teacher.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.380
Did you speak with her
this morning?
Yes.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.781
She didn't say anything
about an accident.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.817
She... she was complaining
about a history test.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.586
Maya go to school
with Genevieve?

16:59.619 --> 17:00.687
Yeah, and she's
in volleyball practice

17:00.720 --> 17:02.289
with her right now.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.257
She's not answering.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.625
I'm sure she's fine, baby.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.727
She just... She's busy.
She can't talk.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.162
Look, the school's
about a half mile from here.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.463
I can meet you there.

17:13.766 --> 17:14.767
Yeah.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.770
Update on the hit

17:19.806 --> 17:22.775
No. Just wanted
to see how you're doing.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.312
Oh.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.681
So... my little girl is a thief.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.783
Not a good look
for the head

17:30.817 --> 17:32.719
of a federal
crime-fighting agency.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.755
Not about the job.
About your family.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.825
But the Internet
will make it about both.

17:38.858 --> 17:42.462
Her mother would know
how to handle this.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.831
On second thought,
if Jackie were still alive,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.099
Kayla would have never done it.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.867
Ah, you don't know that.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.801
Well, let me believe that.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.304
It makes me feel better.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.808
You're a good dad, Leon.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.811
I don't feel like one.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.814
I got two latchkey kids
at home, and...

18:01.848 --> 18:05.618
in my absence,
Kayla's found other influences.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.621
Okay, so take the rest
of the day off.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.858
No, I'm-I'm good.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.593
If you're here, I'm here.

18:13.626 --> 18:17.230
I don't have anything
to go home to.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.133
I don't know, Leon.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.302
Some of those moments

18:22.335 --> 18:24.737
you don't get back.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.906
Go home.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.741
Be with your daughter.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.380
McGEE:
How's Genevieve

18:33.413 --> 18:35.482
as a student?
A dream.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
Good grades, good manners,

18:37.350 --> 18:38.751
student council, the band,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
and, obviously, volleyball.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.888
And Maya Guzman?

18:41.921 --> 18:43.423
Genevieve's best friend.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.891
Nice girl.
Comes from a good family.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.827
Look, these are good kids.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.530
Whatever you think they did,
they didn't do.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.932
This way.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.168
Maya Guzman, Genevieve Bell!

18:55.202 --> 18:55.868
Right here, please.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.507
Big match tomorrow.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.175
We're playing our crosstown
rivals, the Sharks.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.743
Hey, Ms. Petrie.
Hey, Maya.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.478
Uh, where's Genevieve?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.713
Oh, she just left.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.481
Her, um, mom called her,
like, six times.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.517
Oh, her dad was supposed
to meet us here, too.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.585
I'm going back to the house.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.255
Uh, Maya, this gentleman
is from NCIS.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.589
He would like to
speak with you.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.960
Um, can we do this
after practice?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.563
We don't make appointments.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.675
Hey.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.944
Hey.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.913
You're home early.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.318
I guess I'm sitting down.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.831
I don't know, Dad.
What do you want me to say?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.800
Start by telling me
what happened.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.769
You know what happened.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.937
And I still can't believe it.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.640
Help me understand
why you decided to skip school

20:07.674 --> 20:09.476
and steal a purse.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.844
Not all of school.
Just first and second period.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.980
Don't you get cute with me,
young lady.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.983
Kayla, what were you thinking?

20:17.016 --> 20:19.619
I guess I wasn't. I'm sorry.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.288
And that's it?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.755
Stop looking at me like that,

20:22.789 --> 20:25.258
like I killed your cat
or something.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.726
Kayla, you committed larceny,

20:26.759 --> 20:29.396
not to mention truancy
for skipping school.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.431
Misdemeanors, not felonies.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.333
Technically.

20:33.366 --> 20:36.336
But larceny carries
a maximum penalty

20:36.369 --> 20:39.339
of a $5,000 fine
and a year in jail.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.641
First-time offenders
usually get off

20:41.674 --> 20:43.910
or, at worse,
community service, right?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.279
Sometimes, but that doesn't
change the fact that you...

20:46.313 --> 20:49.382
And I'm only 17, so it's not
gonna go on my permanent record.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.318
Kayla,
where are you getting this?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.952
Online.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.487
I read if I don't get off,

20:54.521 --> 20:56.689
I can enter a
diversion program

20:56.723 --> 20:59.992
and ask for probation
with deferred proceedings.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.861
Kayla, you committed
a serious crime.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.330
You already said that.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.597
But you are not listening.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.065
You're not listening!

21:06.098 --> 21:07.834
I said I'm sorry!

21:07.867 --> 21:09.869
It's over.
It won't happen again.

21:09.902 --> 21:10.870
It's... Sit down. Sit down.
Just leave it alone.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.639
We're not finished. You are...
Leave it alone!

21:15.708 --> 21:17.710
Kayla!

21:35.495 --> 21:36.963
What?

21:36.996 --> 21:39.065
Who are you?
Who are you?

21:39.098 --> 21:41.100
NCIS Special Agent
Timothy McGee.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.602
The Bells here?

21:42.635 --> 21:44.404
NCIS?

21:44.437 --> 21:46.973
What did they do?

21:47.006 --> 21:49.709
W

21:49.742 --> 21:51.778
I'm the homeowner.
The Bells' landlord?

21:51.811 --> 21:54.647
Well, I was
until ten minutes ago.
Why

21:54.681 --> 21:57.016
Guy just called me up out of the
blue, said they're moving out.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.518
No explanation,

21:58.551 --> 22:00.987
no notice, no nothing.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.057
You think you
know someone.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.026
They seemed
like such a nice family.

22:07.059 --> 22:10.997
They sure left in
a heck of a hurry.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.032
Couldn't bother to
take all their crap.

22:13.065 --> 22:16.002
They cut up their credit cards
and left their cell phones.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.705
Whoa, whoa.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.374
Stay there.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.610
Mr. Bell!

22:24.076 --> 22:26.012
Stop! Stop!

22:26.045 --> 22:26.913
Stop!

22:34.153 --> 22:36.389
Oh, come on!

22:43.496 --> 22:47.467
So, Maya, where
is Genevieve?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.469
Genevieve Bell.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.738
Your friend.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.573
Where is she?

22:53.606 --> 22:55.442
RICARDO:
Excuse me, Agent Gibbs.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.610
First off, tell us
why we're here.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.779
BISHOP:
Maybe Maya can.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.048
Let's talk about your sleepover
the other night.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.017
Now, what happened
after you took this photo?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.057
She's not gonna speak to you.

23:11.090 --> 23:14.527
Mr. Guzman, it'll be easier
for everyone if you cooperate.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.763
Easier for NCIS,
you mean.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.566
I'm not
just Maya's father.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.835
I'm also her lawyer.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.104
And until we know
why we're here,

23:25.137 --> 23:26.839
I've advised my client
to say nothing.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.476
Vehicular manslaughter.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.911
The night of your sleepover,
a Marine was jogging

23:31.944 --> 23:33.846
along Route 73

23:33.880 --> 23:35.848
when he was struck and killed

23:35.882 --> 23:38.518
by a car owned by John Kendall.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.186
Do you know him, Mr. Guzman?

23:40.219 --> 23:42.589
Kendall?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.056
He's my neighbor.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.525
Yep, that's right.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.859
But he wasn't driving.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.895
And we think we know who was.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.732
You girls go on a joyride?

23:52.765 --> 23:53.900
Not a word, Maya.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.636
Where's your proof?
If you had any,

23:56.669 --> 23:58.571
we'd be sitting
in a less comfortable room

23:58.605 --> 23:59.939
with a one-way mirror in it.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.074
We can arrange that.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.543
We found this

24:03.576 --> 24:05.878
in the car.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.648
Initials "GLB" on the inside.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.952
That's Genevieve's.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.822
Well, Agent
Gibbs, it seems

24:15.855 --> 24:17.490
like you're talking
to the wrong girl.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.792
This conversation
is over.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.093
Let's go, Maya.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.565
VANCE:
I'm not gonna do it.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.667
Jack, no special treatment.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.537
Then why not just tell
the detective that?

24:31.771 --> 24:33.873
You afraid
you're gonna say yes, Leon?

24:33.906 --> 24:36.809
Listen,
you would not be

24:36.843 --> 24:41.548
the first father to call in
a favor to help their kid out.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.216
You pulled strings for me.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.852
You're not my kid.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.587
And that was a matter
of life and death.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.556
This is a valuable life lesson.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.858
Valuable for her or you?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.061
Point taken.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.829
How do I get her to talk to me?

24:56.863 --> 24:58.998
Put yourself
in her shoes.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.000
You're a teenager.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.603
You've just done the stupidest
thing in your life.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.172
And your dad's
the head of NCIS.

25:06.205 --> 25:09.041
She's mum
because she's hiding something.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.877
Or she's embarrassed.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.779
You're an investigator.

25:12.812 --> 25:13.846
Find out.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.716
You got this.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.319
McGEE:
The Bells.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.221
Christopher, Julie,
and Genevieve.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.856
On the run
since last night.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.325
Even left their credit cards
and cell phones.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.094
So they couldn't be traced.
TORRES:
Well, their first stop

25:28.127 --> 25:29.896
after giving McGee the slip...

25:29.929 --> 25:31.163
Not what happened.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.264
...was the bank.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.634
They emptied
their savings account.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.068
They took nearly $23,000.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.705
BOLO found their car
at 4:00 this morning,

25:38.738 --> 25:41.140
abandoned on
a secluded residential street.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.275
Why flee?
Well,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.912
we're thinking Genevieve
was the hit-and-run driver.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.080
They didn't want her
to go to jail, so they ran.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.316
Well, that seems extreme.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.952
TORRES: I agree.
They blow up their lives,

25:52.985 --> 25:54.086
become fugitives,

25:54.120 --> 25:55.655
just to protect their daughter?

25:55.688 --> 25:57.323
Either of the parents
have a record?

25:57.356 --> 25:59.859
Dad does. Assault conviction
when he was 18

25:59.892 --> 26:02.028
for a fight
outside of a Metallica concert,

26:02.061 --> 26:04.897
but nothing since,
and Mom's spotless.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.100
What you thinking,
boss?

26:08.134 --> 26:10.703
Two teachers,

26:10.737 --> 26:12.371
established in
the community.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.273
They drop everything
and they vanish?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.075
They're hiding something.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.312
Send this picture down to Abby

26:20.346 --> 26:22.749
and get Maya back in here.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.757
Welcome
to the uncomfortable room

26:30.790 --> 26:33.726
with the one-way mirror.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.864
I'm gonna tell him, mija.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.131
What?
Yeah? You gonna
tell me what?

26:39.165 --> 26:41.233
I'm the one
that ran over that Marine.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.369
N-No, Daddy...
Excuse me, Maya.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.238
I'm ready to confess,
Agent Gibbs.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.940
I stole John Kendall's car.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.208
It was foggy
that night.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.077
I couldn't see
the jogger.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.979
It was an accident.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.847
I'm sorry.

26:54.881 --> 26:57.684
Is that what happened, Maya?

26:58.718 --> 27:00.052
No...

27:00.086 --> 27:01.788
She's lying, Agent Gibbs.

27:01.821 --> 27:06.025
No, Mr. Guzman, you're lying.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.860
Kendall's car had GPS.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.797
We tracked
its movements that night.

27:10.830 --> 27:14.701
Security camera
at a convenience store.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.036
See? There's the Maserati.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.707
There's your pal Genevieve.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.675
Look who's driving.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.178
Enough.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.654
Maya.

27:39.826 --> 27:43.863
It's like Agent Bishop said.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.766
Mr. Kendall's garage door
was open.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.400
And we just wanted
to take some pictures.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.002
That's all.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.403
But...

27:51.437 --> 27:55.074
then we saw the keys
in the cupholder, so...

27:55.107 --> 27:57.710
You went for a joyride.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.780
It was really
foggy that night.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.348
When we were
driving back,

28:02.381 --> 28:05.918
all I heard was this
loud bang, and...

28:05.952 --> 28:08.721
So we got out
of the car,

28:08.755 --> 28:10.356
and we searched the whole area.
I swear we did.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.158
But we didn't see anything.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.361
We thought maybe it was just a
deer that ran off or something.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.730
Now, you returned Kendall's car.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.732
You wiped off your fingerprints,

28:19.766 --> 28:21.734
you closed the garage door,

28:21.768 --> 28:24.136
and you snuck back home.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.272
:
I'm so, so sorry. I...

28:26.305 --> 28:28.975
We didn't know it was a person.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.278
It was a Marine.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.815
I'm sorry.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.318
Oh.
Come with me.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.122
Okay. Nice
to see you, too, Abby.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.924
No time. We have a problem.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.192
Uh, what's the problem?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.962
Look.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.100
You don't notice? Gibbs noticed.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.035
Gibbs notices
everything.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.469
Notice what?

28:57.503 --> 29:00.139
Mother and father
have blue eyes.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.540
Their daughter, brown eyes.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.375
BISHOP:
Uh, that's...

29:03.409 --> 29:04.877
weird?
It's more than weird.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.512
I mean, genetically,

29:06.545 --> 29:09.115
parents with blue eyes can
have a brown-eyed child,

29:09.148 --> 29:11.150
but it's like a
genetic magic trick.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.086
So Gibbs had me run the DNA
from the toothbrushes

29:14.120 --> 29:15.521
they left at the house...

29:15.554 --> 29:17.556
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh" is right.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.558
DNA is not a match.
The Bells are not

29:19.591 --> 29:21.393
Genevieve's biological parents.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.929
So, what,

29:22.962 --> 29:24.797
she was adopted?
Well, that's what I thought.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.799
Adoption records are sealed,

29:26.833 --> 29:28.801
so I had the high school scan

29:28.835 --> 29:31.971
and send over a copy
of the birth certificate.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.940
Now, it says here that Genevieve
was born in West Virginia

29:33.973 --> 29:35.808
in 2002, and
the parents

29:35.842 --> 29:38.210
are listed as Christopher
and Julie Bell.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.245
Yeah, but they're not.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.512
They're definitely not.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.114
And this is definitely not

29:42.148 --> 29:44.216
a real West Virginia
birth certificate.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.085
It's a forgery.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.354
So if they didn't
adopt her...

29:48.387 --> 29:51.190
They kidnapped Genevieve
when she was an infant.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.826
They just did it again.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.512
Oh.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.347
Hey. Is Kayla here?

30:15.381 --> 30:17.449
She's at the library.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.118
I'll come back.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.320
I think it's best if you don't.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.526
Message received.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.366
Look, Mr. V, you don't like me,

30:34.400 --> 30:37.136
fine, but Kayla's
a great person.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.437
I'd be nowhere
without her.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.139
You know, she believes in me.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.407
More than my own father does.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.942
And I never thought
college was an option,

30:42.975 --> 30:44.276
but she's doing everything
she can

30:44.310 --> 30:46.512
to make sure
I have a chance to go.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.426
GIBBS:
Anything

31:00.459 --> 31:01.427
on the Bells' location?

31:01.460 --> 31:02.428
Abby might have something.

31:02.461 --> 31:03.229
She just called McGee down.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.398
What do we know
about this family?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.400
Well, Abby ran Genevieve Bell's
DNA through the system

31:08.434 --> 31:10.002
and got a familial match
to this guy,

31:10.036 --> 31:13.172
Martin Curtis. In and out
of prison for the past

31:13.205 --> 31:16.342
15 years for robbery
and second-degree assault.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.977
A real peach.

31:18.010 --> 31:18.945
Brown eyes.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.346
Curtis is listed
as the father

31:20.379 --> 31:21.347
on the birth certificate

31:21.380 --> 31:22.581
of Genevieve Curtis,

31:22.614 --> 31:24.450
born in Wheeling,
West Virginia,

31:24.483 --> 31:26.452
on the same day
Genevieve Bell was born.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.619
According
to the birth certificate,

31:27.653 --> 31:30.656
17-year-old Brittany
Rudd was the mother.

31:30.689 --> 31:34.360
Was?
She died six months after
giving birth to Genevieve.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.461
Drug overdose.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.696
Her dad was in prison,
her mom was dead,

31:37.729 --> 31:40.699
so Baby Genevieve should have
entered the foster care system.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.268
It never happened.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.703
No record of Genevieve Curtis
after 2002.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.239
How'd the Bells know
about Genevieve?

31:47.273 --> 31:50.076
Brittany Rudd was a junior in
high school when she gave birth.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.577
Julie Bell was
her English teacher.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.413
Ah. That's the connection
we've been missing.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.249
A week after Brittany died,
Julie suddenly quit her job,

31:57.283 --> 32:00.519
and the Bells moved to Virginia
with their daughter Genevieve.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.022
So there was no legal adoption?

32:03.055 --> 32:05.391
No. It appears
they just took her

32:05.424 --> 32:07.559
and pretended she was theirs.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.095
This Curtis guy,

32:09.128 --> 32:10.729
he know he's a dad?

32:10.762 --> 32:13.432
BISHOP: Well, if he doesn't,
he will soon.

32:13.465 --> 32:16.702
Law requires us
to tell him.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.338
McGEE:
Hey, Abbs.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.073
You wanted to see
Genevieve's cell phone?

32:21.107 --> 32:23.075
I do. But, first,
look at this.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.376
Okay, what do you see?

32:24.410 --> 32:26.612
Again with the photo quiz?

32:26.645 --> 32:28.147
Oh, come on, McGee.
Just play with me.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.548
What's Genevieve wearing?

32:29.581 --> 32:31.150
A sweater.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.220
On her neck.
Headphones.

32:34.253 --> 32:35.721
And what's not
on the headphones?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.290
A wire.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.458
Oh, they're Bluetooth.

32:39.491 --> 32:40.692
Please, tell me

32:40.726 --> 32:42.161
that there is
a headphone app

32:42.194 --> 32:43.395
on Genevieve's phone.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.031
Ooh, I see where
you're going.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.465
Well, see, I got it,

32:46.498 --> 32:49.235
but Bluetooth has a range
of maybe 30 feet.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.669
I don't see how this
is gonna help us.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.005
Well, because the new versions,
they alert the user

32:53.039 --> 32:55.207
whenever the headphones connect
to a new network.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.109
So when Genevieve's using
the headphones...

32:58.510 --> 32:59.711
Oh, there she is.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.180
Harvey Motel, downtown.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.414
Nice work, Abbs.

33:02.448 --> 33:05.017
:
Yes.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.628
Dad?
Mm-hmm.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.065
GENEVIEVE: Are you sure
running's the right decision?

33:19.098 --> 33:21.500
Well, if we want to stay
together as a family,

33:21.533 --> 33:24.236
it's the only decision.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.707
I'm sorry
I messed everything up.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.709
Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.347
It's horrible what happened
to that Marine,

33:35.381 --> 33:37.483
but our life is not your fault.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.485
But because of me,
our secret's out.

33:39.518 --> 33:43.122
Yes, and because of me, we have
a secret in the first place.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.725
Your mother and I knew
this day might come.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.461
We've been looking over
our shoulder for 15 years,

33:49.495 --> 33:51.530
but we've prepared for it,

33:51.563 --> 33:53.765
and we're doing
what we have to do.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.469
Chris, come on.
We got to get out of here.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.271
What's the matter?

33:59.305 --> 34:02.374
I just saw an NCIS agent
downstairs in the hotel office.

34:02.408 --> 34:03.775
All right, forget the
suitcases. Let's go.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.644
Dad, no.
JULIE:
Honey, come on.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.646
We can do it. Let's go.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.215
McGEE:
Mrs. Bell?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.816
NCIS.
:
Come on.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.584
We'll go out the back way.
McGEE: Mrs. Bell.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.155
I don't want to run anymore.

34:21.527 --> 34:24.530
SLOANE: Mr. Curtis,
thank you for coming in.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.864
I didn't do anything.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.866
We know.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.801
Would you care for coffee?

34:29.835 --> 34:31.803
Right.

34:31.837 --> 34:34.373
You just brought me in
for social hour?

34:34.406 --> 34:35.841
JULIE:
She was a, uh,

34:35.874 --> 34:37.609
a precious baby.

34:37.643 --> 34:41.613
And we wanted to help Brittany,
so we...

34:41.647 --> 34:44.750
we would watch Genevieve
when she'd go to work.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.618
Only Brittany did
more than work.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.754
She was out partying
every night.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.257
JULIE: Until one day
when Genevieve

34:51.290 --> 34:52.724
was six months old,

34:52.758 --> 34:54.726
and then Brittany
didn't come to pick her up.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.595
Right. She overdosed.

34:56.628 --> 34:57.863
SLOANE:
Mr. Curtis,

34:57.896 --> 34:59.765
there's no easy way to ask this,

34:59.798 --> 35:03.302
but are you aware
that you're a father?

35:03.335 --> 35:05.571
If she wants money,
I got nothing.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.639
I make $9.40 an hour
cleaning toilets.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.375
I got my own problems.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.645
So you know you have a daughter.

35:13.679 --> 35:17.349
Britt sent me photos.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.918
Brittany, your
ex-girlfriend.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.454
Genevieve's mother.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.825
And do you know
that Brittany passed away?

35:28.727 --> 35:30.529
Yeah, I heard.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.799
And do you know what happened
to your daughter after that?

35:33.832 --> 35:35.801
I figured she, uh...

35:37.636 --> 35:39.371
I don't know what I figured.

35:39.405 --> 35:40.672
JULIE:
Yeah, her no-good boyfriend

35:40.706 --> 35:43.775
was in prison,
both her parents were dead.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.877
They would've put Genevieve
into foster care,

35:45.911 --> 35:48.880
and we couldn't
let that happen.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.550
We'd grown too attached.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.385
Yeah, but you couldn't adopt her

35:53.419 --> 35:55.821
because of that assault
on your record.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.823
That disqualified you.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.226
Stupid fight when I was 18.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.264
Yeah. So you forged
a birth certificate

36:05.297 --> 36:07.466
and she became your daughter.

36:07.499 --> 36:10.569
Not the way we planned
to become parents, but...

36:10.602 --> 36:12.238
We don't regret it for a second.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.605
CURTIS:
So these people

36:13.639 --> 36:15.674
stole my baby?

36:15.707 --> 36:18.544
Not stole, rescued.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.246
Uh-huh.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.481
But I could still sue them.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.884
Uh, for-for kidnapping
or something.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.719
They have money?

36:27.753 --> 36:31.323
Think about what you are
proposing here.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.924
Do you really think

36:32.958 --> 36:35.994
that's in the best interest
of your daughter?

36:36.027 --> 36:39.831
What about me?

36:39.865 --> 36:42.801
What's best for me?

36:42.834 --> 36:45.471
JULIE:
Agent Gibbs,

36:45.504 --> 36:48.974
will we ever see her again?

36:49.007 --> 36:51.710
McGEE:
Well, of course they will.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.579
Won't they, Director?

36:53.612 --> 36:55.247
It's not our call.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.483
Family court will
have to sort this out.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.485
That's crazy.
They raised her.

36:59.518 --> 37:02.854
Yeah, but the biological
father has rights.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.523
Biological felon.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.959
I don't like it either,
but that's the law.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.996
There's got to be
a better way.

37:11.029 --> 37:13.865
I'm open to suggestions,
Agent McGee.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.904
SLOANE:
You sure you want to do this?

37:18.937 --> 37:20.906
Mm-hmm.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.513
Okay. Just say
what's in your heart.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.649
Okay.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.660
Genevieve, this
is Martin Curtis.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.498
Nice to meet you.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.968
You're big.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.304
How old are you now?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.606
Fifteen.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.008
What grade is that?

37:57.042 --> 38:00.646
Uh, tenth.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.682
I met Brittany
in the tenth grade.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.017
Your mom.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.990
My mom's in the other room.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.561
What is this?

38:17.496 --> 38:20.532
Genevieve just
wanted to meet you.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.539
Mr. Curtis,
I have a question.

38:27.573 --> 38:31.009
Will you let me go?

38:33.945 --> 38:37.048
Sir, filing a lawsuit

38:37.082 --> 38:38.750
against the
Bells would mean

38:38.784 --> 38:41.420
you are seeking legal
custody of Genevieve.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.956
I can't make any promises.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.958
Please.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.060
I want to live with my parents.

38:55.066 --> 38:58.003
It's complicated.

39:00.138 --> 39:03.008
Please.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.646
What's her name?

39:07.679 --> 39:09.681
Your mom.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.917
Julie.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.085
Chris is my dad.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.827
They take good care of you?

39:21.860 --> 39:25.664
I love them very much.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.934
The thing is...

39:28.967 --> 39:31.637
It's-it's... .it's just, uh...

39:38.877 --> 39:41.012
Let me get a look at you.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.119
Fifteen.

39:48.153 --> 39:51.122
Wow.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.092
You grew up.

39:54.125 --> 39:57.028
I named you Genevieve.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.030
Did you know that?

40:01.032 --> 40:04.169
I named you.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.977
What do I have to sign?

40:12.010 --> 40:13.411
GIBBS:
This document.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.715
Signing it will
award legal custody

40:16.748 --> 40:19.685
of Genevieve to the Bells.

40:45.511 --> 40:46.945
Hi, Mom.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.748
:
Oh, Gen.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.517
Gen. Oh...

40:52.984 --> 40:56.054
How are you?
I'm okay.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.123
Are you okay?

40:58.156 --> 41:01.092
*

41:01.126 --> 41:03.962
VANCE:
So, Genevieve gets to live

41:03.995 --> 41:07.032
with the only parents
that she's ever known.

41:07.065 --> 41:10.068
Wow. Crazy story, Dad.
Mm.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.970
She's lucky to have
parents like that.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.005
Yeah, yeah, she is.

41:14.039 --> 41:17.843
Just as I'm lucky to have
a daughter like you.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.846
Yeah, right.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.748
A thief.

41:26.652 --> 41:27.686
What?

41:27.719 --> 41:30.021
Your friend Mandy is 18, right?

41:30.055 --> 41:31.857
Yeah.
Mm.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.291
I checked her record.

41:35.093 --> 41:38.096
She's got two
shoplifting charges,

41:38.129 --> 41:40.131
as a juvenile.

41:40.165 --> 41:43.168
If she got a third,
this time as an adult,

41:43.201 --> 41:45.971
maybe college
doesn't happen.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.939
Maybe.

41:47.973 --> 41:51.610
You, however,
are still 17.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.945
You have no record.

41:53.979 --> 41:57.616
You've been granted
early acceptance to Georgetown.

41:57.649 --> 42:01.119
A small indiscretion
wouldn't ruin your future.

42:01.152 --> 42:05.256
I think you confessed to a crime
that you didn't commit,

42:05.290 --> 42:08.960
so your friend could get
a higher education.

42:08.994 --> 42:11.262
So, if I don't get probation,

42:11.296 --> 42:14.600
I could get up to 30 hours
of community service.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.302
You think I should work
at a homeless shelter

42:17.335 --> 42:20.005
or teach people
how to read?

42:20.038 --> 42:23.041
They both sound like very
noble volunteer opportunities.

42:23.074 --> 42:26.177
I'm thinking
the adult literacy classes.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.747
Can help somebody
change their life.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.717
You already have.
