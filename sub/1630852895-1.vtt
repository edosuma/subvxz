00:42.919 --> 00:46.560
(big band intro)

01:03.326 --> 01:06.299
(indistinct chatter)

01:07.141 --> 01:09.445
(man) Hey, that's a great idea.

01:12.084 --> 01:15.424
- (man 2) Clear the way!
- (alarm ringing)

01:16.994 --> 01:19.767
(big band, jazz music)

01:19.867 --> 01:22.038
(tires screeching)

01:22.138 --> 01:25.377
(siren wailing,
horn honking)

01:29.586 --> 01:32.926
Whoo!

01:33.026 --> 01:35.899
We have a third-alarm call
from the Clock Tower!

01:35.999 --> 01:38.671
There are people
trapped on the top floor!

01:38.771 --> 01:39.873
(barks)

01:39.973 --> 01:41.109
I'm not Georgia.

01:41.209 --> 01:43.413
I'm Captain Georgia!

01:45.184 --> 01:47.188
(gasps) It looks like a bad one!

01:47.288 --> 01:49.927
Hurry, Probie!
We have people to save!

01:50.027 --> 01:52.264
(gasps) Look out!

01:53.367 --> 01:54.837
(screams)

01:54.937 --> 01:56.640
(grunts)

01:56.741 --> 01:58.878
Whoo-hoo!

01:58.978 --> 02:01.282
- (gasps)
- (train bell rings)

02:05.525 --> 02:06.827
Ember, stretch a line,

02:06.927 --> 02:09.065
hook up to the hydrant
and extend the ladder.

02:09.165 --> 02:12.304
I've got to get
to the top floor.

02:12.405 --> 02:15.177
(both screaming)

02:20.522 --> 02:22.191
Whoa!

02:25.364 --> 02:27.268
(screams)

02:28.470 --> 02:30.909
(giggles, gasps)

02:31.009 --> 02:34.516
- (dog whimpers)
- (screams)

02:35.952 --> 02:37.789
(giggles)

02:37.889 --> 02:41.096
(gasps, screams)

02:43.433 --> 02:45.237
(screams)

02:46.841 --> 02:49.212
(screams)

02:50.782 --> 02:54.222
- Aaah!
- No...!

02:54.322 --> 02:56.159
<i>(Georgia) You see</i>
<i>that amazing girl?</i>

02:56.259 --> 02:58.163
<i>Well, it's me, Georgia Nolan.</i>

02:58.263 --> 03:01.002
<i>And this is my faithful dog,</i>
<i>Ember Nolan.</i>

03:01.102 --> 03:02.506
<i>She's sweet, right?</i>

03:02.606 --> 03:05.210
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>
<i>the man freaking out</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:07.181
<i>is my dad, Captain Shawn Nolan.</i>

03:07.281 --> 03:09.318
<i>Let me tell you about him.</i>

03:10.989 --> 03:13.059
<i>Captain Shawn Nolan</i>

03:13.160 --> 03:15.164
<i>was the best</i>
<i>and bravest fireman</i>

03:15.264 --> 03:18.003
<i>in the whole wide world</i>
<i>of New York.</i>

03:18.538 --> 03:20.107
(gasps)

03:20.207 --> 03:22.244
<i>He saved so many lives.</i>

03:22.344 --> 03:24.783
- He was a legend!
- (all) Yeah!

03:24.883 --> 03:27.722
<i>(Georgia) But he couldn't save</i>
<i>my mom when she had a baby...</i>

03:27.823 --> 03:29.560
<i>who was me.</i>

03:29.660 --> 03:32.198
<i>At first he tried to be</i>
<i>a fireman and a dad</i>

03:32.298 --> 03:33.601
<i>at the same time.</i>

03:33.701 --> 03:35.672
Oh! No! No, no, no, no!

03:35.772 --> 03:37.609
<i>That was very difficult.</i>

03:37.709 --> 03:39.178
- (sighs)
- (giggles)

03:39.278 --> 03:43.453
<i>So he became a tailor instead,</i>
<i>like his dad.</i>

03:43.554 --> 03:48.463
<i>He said he didn't mind because</i>
<i>he loves me so, so, so much.</i>

03:48.564 --> 03:51.604
<i>Along with Ember, we have</i>
<i>a super great life together.</i>

03:51.704 --> 03:55.310
<i>And now I'm training to be</i>
<i>a fireman and save lives</i>

03:55.410 --> 03:59.987
<i>just like my hero</i>
<i>Captain Shawn Nolan used to do.</i>

04:00.087 --> 04:04.061
<i>It's my dream. It's my destiny!</i>

04:04.162 --> 04:06.065
- Oh!
- (clanging)

04:06.166 --> 04:08.069
Emergency
at the chemical factory!

04:08.170 --> 04:10.942
- Georgia, no!
- (crashing)

04:11.042 --> 04:12.679
Emergency!
Fire on the zip line!

04:12.779 --> 04:14.516
- Georgia, no!
- Whoa!

04:14.616 --> 04:16.252
- Whoa!
- (smashing)

04:16.352 --> 04:17.656
Emergency on Brooklyn Bridge!

04:17.756 --> 04:20.060
- But I got it...
- No, Georgia, no!

04:20.160 --> 04:22.566
- ...under control!
- No!

04:22.666 --> 04:24.670
(whimpers)

04:24.770 --> 04:27.676
(soft music)

04:27.776 --> 04:30.180
- The doctor says it's nothing.
- Stop with that!

04:30.280 --> 04:32.384
- (Ember) Oh?
- You could've broken your neck.

04:32.484 --> 04:34.088
But Ember was the fire truck.

04:34.188 --> 04:37.394
- And we had to go save people!
- Georgia, enough!

04:37.494 --> 04:40.367
No more rescues inside the house
or on the street,

04:40.467 --> 04:43.006
or at the bottom of the sea,
or on top of a mountain,

04:43.106 --> 04:45.310
in the jungle, in the desert,
or on the moon.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.951
Dad, there can't be a fire
on the moon. There's no oxygen.

04:49.051 --> 04:51.289
I know that.
(breathing hard)

04:51.389 --> 04:55.531
Listen to me. No more
fireman games anywhere at all.

04:55.632 --> 04:58.036
But I have to train
to be a fireman

04:58.136 --> 05:00.340
if I want to save lots of people
just like you.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.013
Georgia, I'm a tailor now.

05:03.113 --> 05:05.585
I don't save people from fires.

05:05.685 --> 05:08.724
I save them
from holes in their pants.

05:08.824 --> 05:11.664
Do you think
I would be a good fireman?

05:11.764 --> 05:14.235
Yes, you'd be a great fireman.

05:14.335 --> 05:16.372
You have the heart for it,
but... (sighs)

05:16.472 --> 05:20.582
In that case, no one
can stop me. Not even you.

05:22.151 --> 05:23.286
(Ember whimpers)

05:23.386 --> 05:25.725
I have to tell her, Ember.
(sighs)

05:25.825 --> 05:28.831
The longer we wait,
the worse it will be.

05:31.637 --> 05:33.073
(sighs)

05:36.246 --> 05:37.816
Nice hat.

05:37.916 --> 05:40.487
I may need to borrow it
for the spaghetti later, though.

05:40.588 --> 05:43.661
Or else there'd be
a meatball emergency.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.165
Yeah. (chuckles) Funny.

05:46.967 --> 05:49.640
Georgia...

05:49.740 --> 05:54.750
Do you know why we say fireman
and not firewoman?

05:54.850 --> 05:56.520
To save time?

05:56.620 --> 05:58.524
No, Peanut.

05:58.624 --> 06:01.129
Because girls aren't allowed
to be firemen.

06:01.229 --> 06:04.603
- It's against the rules.
- Why?

06:04.703 --> 06:08.076
Well, people don't think
girls are strong enough

06:08.176 --> 06:09.713
for such a dangerous job.

06:09.813 --> 06:13.219
But I'm training
so I get really strong.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.790
And I'm brave.

06:14.890 --> 06:16.459
As brave as any boy.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.929
You know I am.

06:18.029 --> 06:21.937
I do know. There's no one
who deserves it more.

06:22.037 --> 06:25.243
But I'm afraid
those are the rules.

06:25.344 --> 06:28.483
- Will the rules change?
- I hope they will.

06:28.584 --> 06:31.055
But these things
can take a long time.

06:31.155 --> 06:32.525
And I wouldn't want you
waiting around

06:32.625 --> 06:34.596
for something
that might never happen.

06:34.696 --> 06:38.971
But you can be a seamstress
and work with me!

06:39.071 --> 06:41.476
Is the sewing machine on fire?

06:41.577 --> 06:42.846
No.

06:42.946 --> 06:44.415
In that case, no, thank you.

06:44.516 --> 06:46.520
Georgia, I don't how else
to say this:

06:46.620 --> 06:48.524
you will never be a fireman!

06:48.624 --> 06:50.427
(soft gasp)

06:50.528 --> 06:53.901
- Oh, I'm sorry, Peanut.
- (sighs)

06:54.970 --> 06:57.509
I know it's unfair.

06:59.345 --> 07:01.684
(whimpers)

07:09.498 --> 07:10.935
(sighs)

07:13.541 --> 07:15.545
(sighs)

07:17.649 --> 07:20.220
(soft music)

07:20.320 --> 07:22.792
(Ember whimpers)

07:26.967 --> 07:28.470
(Shawn sighs)

07:28.571 --> 07:30.207
I know.

07:30.307 --> 07:33.614
One day I'll have to tell her
the whole story...

07:34.850 --> 07:36.787
Just not yet.

07:41.997 --> 07:43.934
Okay, Ember, let's go.

07:48.577 --> 07:51.249
(whimpers softly)

07:53.453 --> 07:58.196
(whispering) I promise
I'll always protect you.

08:09.185 --> 08:11.523
(growling, grunting)

08:14.696 --> 08:16.900
(grunting)

08:20.942 --> 08:22.679
(grunting)

08:26.887 --> 08:29.659
(crying)

08:38.476 --> 08:41.517
(crying continues)

08:52.104 --> 08:54.475
(dramatic music)

08:55.477 --> 08:57.214
Approaching the auditorium now.

08:57.314 --> 08:59.084
It's just like the other fires.

08:59.185 --> 09:01.523
Colored smoke, intense light,

09:01.623 --> 09:04.361
and the same strange music.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.499
<i>(man over radio)</i>
<i>Enter with extreme caution.</i>

09:06.600 --> 09:08.938
<i>You know what happened</i>
<i>to the others.</i>

09:11.543 --> 09:14.549
- Send water.
<i>- Sending water.</i>

09:14.649 --> 09:17.555
Wait for my order
to open the nozzle.

09:18.256 --> 09:19.926
We're going in.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.464
(dramatic organ music)

09:34.956 --> 09:37.060
Georgia! Come on!

09:37.161 --> 09:38.263
(gulps)

09:38.363 --> 09:41.803
Ooh! Yes!

09:41.904 --> 09:43.106
Oh, yeah, hmm...

09:43.206 --> 09:45.578
Georgia, this is your last call!

09:45.678 --> 09:48.249
- Morning, Daddy.
- Finally. Now hurry up and eat.

09:48.349 --> 09:50.955
We have sew much to do today.

09:51.055 --> 09:55.130
Argh, you're hilarious.
You have me in stitches.

09:55.230 --> 09:57.569
Oh, you're as cute
as a button.

09:57.669 --> 10:01.008
Well, we are
cut from the same cloth.

10:02.946 --> 10:05.751
(lively jazz music)

10:24.054 --> 10:25.524
(yawns)

10:25.625 --> 10:27.427
<i>(radio) We interrupt</i>
<i>the Champion Spark Plug Hour</i>

10:27.528 --> 10:29.198
<i>with a special news flash.</i>

10:29.298 --> 10:31.202
<i>Yet another Broadway theater</i>
<i>has been hit by the arsonist.</i>

10:31.302 --> 10:33.406

10:33.507 --> 10:34.876
<i>He had this to say</i>

<i>(Jimmy) Everyone needs</i>

10:37.047 --> 10:37.949
(radio stops)

10:38.049 --> 10:39.485
You know what we need?

10:39.586 --> 10:41.723
Here is Georgia Nolan for WKBZ

10:41.823 --> 10:43.661
interviewing Shawn Nolan.

10:43.761 --> 10:46.065
I heard you hit
a new alteration record today.

10:46.165 --> 10:47.434
Is this true?

10:47.535 --> 10:49.305
Before I answer,
have we punned out yet?

10:49.405 --> 10:50.741
Of course not.

10:50.841 --> 10:54.415
In that case, it seams
I'm going to be inducted

10:54.516 --> 10:56.085
into the sewing
hall of fame.

10:56.185 --> 10:58.156
(chuckles) Nice one.

10:58.256 --> 11:00.160
- (honking)
- (gasps)

11:00.260 --> 11:01.228
(siren wailing)

11:01.329 --> 11:02.865
Do you think it's the arsonist?

11:02.966 --> 11:07.107
I don't know. Anyway, I'm happy
you're not on that truck.

11:07.207 --> 11:09.078
- What do you mean?
- Well, don't you remember?

11:09.178 --> 11:11.883
When you were little,
you wanted to be a fireman?

11:11.984 --> 11:13.286
- Did I?
- Pff...

11:13.386 --> 11:15.858
Oh, yeah. Very, very badly.

11:15.958 --> 11:19.633
That's silly.
Girls don't get to be firemen.

11:19.733 --> 11:23.774
Yeah. You could have lived
your dream if you were a boy.

11:36.032 --> 11:37.234
Come on, lazybones.

11:37.334 --> 11:40.975
- (Georgia grunts)
- (Ember snores)

11:42.311 --> 11:44.214
Ember! (grunts)

11:44.315 --> 11:45.483
- Stop!
- (whines)

11:45.584 --> 11:47.889
(Georgia panting)

11:52.397 --> 11:54.335
Girls can't be firemen?

11:54.435 --> 11:56.372
- Give me a break.
- (yawns)

11:56.472 --> 11:59.244
You wanna know
what I think, Ember?

11:59.345 --> 12:01.783
Well, I'll tell you anyway.

12:02.919 --> 12:04.556
All these years of training

12:04.656 --> 12:07.595
at night, in the cold,
in the rain, in the snow

12:07.695 --> 12:09.799
are finally gonna pay off.

12:09.899 --> 12:12.505
I've worked and worked
and worked

12:12.605 --> 12:13.841
and now my chance is coming.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.245
I can smell it.
Can you smell it?

12:16.345 --> 12:18.550
(whimpers, sniffs)

12:19.151 --> 12:20.988
Smell harder.

12:22.024 --> 12:24.328
- Wait. I hear something.
- Huh?

12:24.428 --> 12:26.499
Ember, shh!

12:28.537 --> 12:30.206
Oh! Look.

12:30.306 --> 12:32.044
Look. The police.

12:32.144 --> 12:34.214
Wh...? Ember. Ember.

12:34.314 --> 12:35.651
Jimmy Murray.

12:35.751 --> 12:37.789
That's Jimmy Murray,
the mayor of New York!

12:37.889 --> 12:39.993
- Shawn!
- What's he doing here?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.462
Dad?

12:41.563 --> 12:44.068
- (Shawn) OK.
- They know each other?

12:44.168 --> 12:45.437
I'm going down!

12:45.538 --> 12:48.409
Oh, Ember, don't fuss.
They'll never see me.

12:48.510 --> 12:50.480
(screams silently) Ooh!

12:50.581 --> 12:52.117
- Oh!
- (Jimmy) Listen to me, Shawn.

12:52.217 --> 12:55.825
This arsonist has already
burnt 40 theaters.

12:55.925 --> 13:00.768
And get this, with no flames,
just blue and red smoke.

13:00.868 --> 13:02.872
And creepy music.

13:02.972 --> 13:04.976
(Shawn) The newspapers
spoke of missing firemen...

13:05.076 --> 13:08.383
(Jimmy) Nah, idle gossip,
maybe one or two.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.886
- Hah!
- Come on, Jimmy, spill it.

13:09.986 --> 13:11.757
(Jimmy) Alright. All of them.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.761
- (whispering) All of them?
- (Shawn) What do you mean?

13:13.861 --> 13:18.737
The firemen that go into the
theaters, they don't come out.

13:18.837 --> 13:21.075
- They just disappear.
- (Georgia gasps)

13:21.175 --> 13:23.479
You're telling me
that all the firemen

13:23.580 --> 13:25.216
in New York have vanished?

13:25.316 --> 13:26.485
(grunts)

13:26.586 --> 13:28.356
All but one.

13:28.456 --> 13:30.060
Oh, no, no, no, Jimmy.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.632
I know what you're gonna ask me,
but I'm out.

13:32.732 --> 13:35.236
Hey, Shabbat Shalom, y'all!
How ya doin'?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.942
Don't forget to vote Jimmy
Murray! Polls open on Tuesday.

13:38.042 --> 13:40.213
Not Saturday.
Good, right?

13:40.313 --> 13:41.550
You got it? Okay.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.620
No excuses, now.
The show must go on!

13:43.720 --> 13:45.724
I gotta do something now.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.632
So I need you to run
the fire investigation,

13:49.732 --> 13:51.903
just for a few days,
for old times' sake...

13:52.003 --> 13:55.176
whaddya say ol' buddy,
ol' pal o' mine?
Oh, please, don't say...

13:55.276 --> 13:56.546
- No.
- No?

13:56.646 --> 13:58.717
(screams silently)

13:58.817 --> 14:00.120
I appreciate the offer, Jimmy.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.959
But I'm a tailor now.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.330
Listen,
I know why you left, Shawn.

14:05.430 --> 14:08.269
But this is your chance
to get over what happened.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.574
Finish your career with a bang.

14:10.674 --> 14:12.477
(sighs) I'll never get over it.

14:12.578 --> 14:15.718
- Hmm.
- Good night, Jimmy.

14:16.352 --> 14:17.688
(relieved sigh)

14:18.891 --> 14:21.563
The whole city is in danger.

14:21.663 --> 14:25.905
Nobody's safe...
not even your daughter.

14:26.673 --> 14:28.242
(sighs)

14:31.449 --> 14:33.085
- I'll need a team.
- Yes!

14:33.186 --> 14:35.724
Oh-ho-ho...
As many guys as you want.

14:35.825 --> 14:37.160
No, no, no. A small team.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.534
Just a chemist
and a driver, a fast one.

14:40.634 --> 14:42.672
And I want all the evidence
you've got.

14:42.772 --> 14:45.310
Photos, samples, everything.
- Done and done!

14:45.410 --> 14:49.752
Your team will be at the
firehouse tomorrow, Shawnie.

14:49.853 --> 14:53.192
Excuse me. Captain Nolan.

14:54.696 --> 14:57.300
(engine roaring)

14:58.102 --> 15:00.574
- (barks)
- I'm okay.

15:00.674 --> 15:02.244
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.014
(whines)

15:04.114 --> 15:06.418
(Georgia) Oh, my gosh! What kind
of tailoring emergency?

15:06.520 --> 15:08.489
(Shawn)
It's a corduroy disaster.

15:08.590 --> 15:09.993
(gasps)
That does sound serious.

15:10.093 --> 15:12.832
I know, so I have no choice
but to leave you alone

15:12.932 --> 15:14.802
for a couple of days,
and I'm worried.

15:14.903 --> 15:17.174
Relax. Everything will be fine.
Ember will protect me.

15:17.274 --> 15:18.744
Hmm?

15:18.844 --> 15:21.482
Honey, you know what?
Don't work. You know?

15:21.583 --> 15:22.985
- Take a personal day.
- Oh!

15:23.085 --> 15:24.488
I didn't know
we had personal days.

15:24.589 --> 15:26.192
We do now. You stay home!

15:26.292 --> 15:28.730
Of course.
I have a radio. I'm all set.

15:28.830 --> 15:31.870
Dad, go deal
with that corduroy disaster.

15:31.970 --> 15:33.306
- Wait, wait, wait!
- (door bangs shut)

15:33.406 --> 15:34.842
(muffled) Okay, okay!

15:34.943 --> 15:38.216
- Uh, love you! See you tonight.
- So, here's the plan.

15:38.316 --> 15:40.053
(whimpers)

15:40.153 --> 15:42.925
I join Dad's team,
I catch the arsonist,

15:43.025 --> 15:44.762
I save the city,
they change the rules,

15:44.863 --> 15:48.202
and I get to be
the first fireman... woman.

15:48.302 --> 15:49.238
(groans)

15:49.338 --> 15:51.543
For hair,
a mix of engine oil,

15:51.643 --> 15:53.346
black shoe polish and honey.

15:53.446 --> 15:55.918
Marshmallow in the cheeks
to form the jaw.

15:56.018 --> 15:57.354
Putty for the nose.

15:57.454 --> 15:58.557
For thighs, a mix of sawdust

15:58.657 --> 15:59.726
and cucumber peel.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.061
Pillows in the shoulders.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.899
Egg crate
for the stomach muscles.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.434
Mango for the biceps.

16:04.535 --> 16:05.671
(coughs)

16:05.771 --> 16:07.374
(gasps for air)

16:07.474 --> 16:09.646
Don't worry, Ember.
Dad won't recognize me.

16:09.746 --> 16:10.915
(grunts)

16:11.015 --> 16:13.386
And for the mustache,
carpet fringes.

16:13.486 --> 16:14.956
(masculine voice) Huh. Hello.

16:15.056 --> 16:18.564
Why, yeah, I do fight fires...
with my bare hands.

16:18.664 --> 16:20.166
(gasps)

16:20.266 --> 16:22.203
Thanks for giving me
a better idea.

16:22.304 --> 16:24.074
(whimpers)

16:28.482 --> 16:31.221
(masculine voice) Hey, sister,
looking for a mister?

16:31.322 --> 16:32.424
(chuckles)

16:32.525 --> 16:33.326
What?

16:33.426 --> 16:34.494
Oh!

16:34.596 --> 16:36.131
Okay. Too much.
Too much.

16:36.231 --> 16:38.102
I knew it was too much.
I said it.

Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

17:46.071 --> 17:48.744
Panic grips city!
Arsonist strikes again!

17:48.844 --> 17:51.750
Plus: the Chrysler Building
is now the tallest building
in the world!

17:51.850 --> 17:53.486
- And couple does the jitterbug.
- Wow!

17:53.587 --> 17:55.591
Hey, excuse me. Hey.

17:55.691 --> 17:57.528
Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:57.628 --> 18:00.400
I'm looking for the Times Square
firehouse. Hey...

18:00.500 --> 18:03.005
- Hey! Whoa! Hey!
- Watch it, okay!

18:03.105 --> 18:06.211
- Go back to Jersey, you bum!
- Whoa!

18:10.486 --> 18:11.990
Hey! You want a pickle?

18:12.090 --> 18:15.029
We got, uh, garlic,
and, uh...

18:15.129 --> 18:16.666
extra garlic too.

18:16.766 --> 18:18.369
Smells like it.

18:18.469 --> 18:20.239
Um, could you point me
in the direction

18:20.339 --> 18:21.876
of the Times Square firehouse?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.348
Sure, so, uh, what you wanna do

18:24.448 --> 18:28.089
is take your first right
onto Who Cares Street.

18:28.189 --> 18:31.028
Then head straight down to, uh,
oh, what is it again?

18:31.128 --> 18:35.036
Oh, right.
Do-I-Look-Like-a-Map Boulevard!

18:35.136 --> 18:37.374
Whoa! Thank you, sir.

18:37.474 --> 18:39.779
That's so kind of you.

18:39.879 --> 18:42.852
Lousy tourist.
Didn't even buy a pickle.

18:42.952 --> 18:44.822
- Garlic pickle?
- Argh!

18:44.922 --> 18:47.093
(man) Taxi! (whistles)

18:53.740 --> 18:56.211
(soft music)

18:58.884 --> 19:01.088
H... Hello? (clears throat)

19:01.188 --> 19:03.125
(masculine voice)
I mean, hello!

19:03.225 --> 19:06.165
Anyone here? (gasps)

19:13.012 --> 19:15.283
(chuckles)

19:15.383 --> 19:18.222
(epic music)

19:24.301 --> 19:27.908
(grunts, chuckles happily)

19:29.645 --> 19:32.350
(hums)

19:32.450 --> 19:33.687
Hey!

19:33.787 --> 19:35.524
Hi!

19:35.624 --> 19:37.995
Ting. Pooh!

19:38.095 --> 19:39.632
(horn blares)

19:40.634 --> 19:42.270
(clears throat)

19:49.417 --> 19:51.455
Huh...

19:56.131 --> 19:57.500
Oh!
(chuckling)

19:58.035 --> 20:00.339
(gasps)
Huh...

20:02.343 --> 20:03.914
Are you one of the volunteers?

20:04.014 --> 20:06.452
(clears throat)
Mm-hm.

20:07.755 --> 20:10.493
Do I know you?

20:10.594 --> 20:12.230
Mh-mm-mm-mm-mh.

20:12.330 --> 20:14.735
Come on, then. You're late.

20:14.836 --> 20:16.539
(relieved sigh)

20:18.643 --> 20:20.480
(frame clanging)

20:20.581 --> 20:21.683
Pfff!

20:21.783 --> 20:23.352
Okay, I'm Captain Shawn Nolan

20:23.452 --> 20:25.891
and I will be running
the fire investigation.

20:25.991 --> 20:30.767
We have an arsonist to stop
and we have 800 firemen to find.

20:30.868 --> 20:33.472
Now, I know you aren't
professionals and it's a...

20:33.573 --> 20:34.942
Oh, yes! Yes!

20:35.042 --> 20:36.813
An amazing speech!

20:36.913 --> 20:38.282
Goosebumps!
I'm telling you.

20:38.382 --> 20:39.919
(whispering) We have no time.

20:40.019 --> 20:41.556
Let me introduce your team.

20:41.656 --> 20:45.329
Now, here's the brains
of your operation, Ricardo.

20:45.429 --> 20:47.400
- Your chemist.
- Actually, sir,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.404
I would describe myself more
as a physicist,

20:49.505 --> 20:52.010
given my experiments
on Einstein's theory of quanta

20:52.110 --> 20:54.314
in photoelectric effects
in kinetic energy.

20:54.414 --> 20:57.287
- (gasps)
- That's my man!

20:57.387 --> 20:59.090
He talks like a calculator.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.328
Where did you graduate
college, Ricardo?

21:01.428 --> 21:04.969
Actually I, uh, do my research
at home in my basement.

21:05.069 --> 21:07.040
- Hmm...
- Where I live with my mama.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.810
- (Shawn growls)
- Very nice.

21:08.910 --> 21:10.346
Home school. Amazing.

21:10.446 --> 21:11.983
You did that with your kid,
right, Shawn?

21:12.083 --> 21:13.485
Oh... yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:13.587 --> 21:16.526
Jin's your driver.
Fastest cabbie in Manhattan.

21:16.626 --> 21:19.532
Everyone knows him as
the Checker Cheetah of Chelsea.

21:19.632 --> 21:21.068
Yeah, I'm the Cheetah.

21:21.168 --> 21:22.738
The Cheetah? How old are you?

21:22.838 --> 21:24.140
- Fifteen, sir.
- Fifteen?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.677
- Twenty-one.
- You just said fifteen.

21:25.777 --> 21:27.213
No, I said twenty-one.

21:27.313 --> 21:29.619
- He said fifteen.
- No, no, he said twenty-one.

21:29.719 --> 21:33.760
Oh... And who's this third one?
I only asked for the two.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.532
- Wait. You didn't find him?
- Me? No. Who are you?

21:36.633 --> 21:39.939
Oh, me? Uh, I'm Georg...
uh, Georg...

21:40.039 --> 21:42.945
Gior-gio,
Giorgio, Giorgio. Joe!

21:43.045 --> 21:44.849
I'm Joe! I'm Joe!
I'm a fireman.

21:44.949 --> 21:46.753
I'm Joe the fireman!
Fireman Joe.

21:46.853 --> 21:48.723
(chuckles, grunts)

21:48.823 --> 21:50.259
(farts)

21:51.696 --> 21:54.234
A fireman?
Are you sure I don't know you?

21:54.334 --> 21:58.175
No! No, no.
I live, I live, uh, far away.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.747
Uh, I'm a man.
And I'm strong.

22:00.847 --> 22:02.483
- I'm strong!
- Take him.

22:02.585 --> 22:04.789
- I'm a fireman.
- He has experience.

22:04.889 --> 22:06.458
Alright. Welcome...

22:06.559 --> 22:07.795
Ugh.

22:07.895 --> 22:08.897
- ...aboard!
- Ho!

22:08.997 --> 22:11.401
Oh, uh, I'm a sweater.

22:11.502 --> 22:14.107
(chuckles)
Uh, and I eat a lot of mangoes.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.278
- A lot of mangoes.
- Can I uh, talk to you?

22:16.378 --> 22:18.950
- You can taste it...
- Tell me this is a joke.

22:19.050 --> 22:21.623
Nah, they're the only ones
who accepted
this suicide mission.

22:21.723 --> 22:23.860
I mean potentially suic...
You know what I mean.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.433
- I'm strong and a fireman!
- (alarm ringing)

22:27.534 --> 22:29.437
Okay, team, suit up!
Suit up! Suit up!

22:29.538 --> 22:32.745
- Excuse me? For what?
- Maybe a fire?

22:32.845 --> 22:34.014
Oh!

22:34.114 --> 22:35.584
(rapid breathing)

22:35.684 --> 22:37.053
Ooh!

22:37.153 --> 22:39.190
- Oh, good gravy!
- Good luck, my friend.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.831
City is counting on me!
I mean, you. Counting on you.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.148
I'm actually doing this?
Hoo!

22:52.551 --> 22:55.590
(Ricardo reciting a prayer)

23:02.805 --> 23:05.042
(chuckles)

23:05.142 --> 23:07.514
Come on, you know
there's an alarm, right?

23:07.614 --> 23:09.384
We shouldn't be wasting
our time.

23:09.484 --> 23:11.388
(tires screeching)

23:11.488 --> 23:14.294
Hey!
Easy there, Cheetah!

23:14.394 --> 23:16.198
Relax.
I'm an expert driver.

23:16.298 --> 23:18.102
In a cab, not a ladder truck!

23:18.202 --> 23:20.373
One's red, one's yellow,
same diff!

23:20.473 --> 23:22.377
The Cheetah's back!

23:22.477 --> 23:24.582
Whoa!

23:26.051 --> 23:27.453
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:27.554 --> 23:30.393
Wrong way!
Turn around! Turn around!

23:30.493 --> 23:33.733
But this is my shortcut.
Normally I'd ask for a tip.

23:33.833 --> 23:36.939
Normally a fifteen-year-old kid
doesn't drive a ladder truck!

23:37.040 --> 23:37.975
I'm twenty-one.

23:38.075 --> 23:39.310
In Cheetah years?

23:39.411 --> 23:41.616
- Yeah, baby!
- Are you okay?

23:41.716 --> 23:43.887
(Ricardo vomits)

23:43.987 --> 23:45.156
(gasps) Oh no!

23:45.256 --> 23:47.528
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, not good.

23:50.366 --> 23:53.372
(jazz music)

23:56.713 --> 24:01.589
Nice. Wha...
That's it. Whoa, whoa.

24:03.893 --> 24:06.298
Whoa! Oh...

24:06.999 --> 24:08.603
Beautiful butt hair.

24:08.703 --> 24:09.905
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

24:10.005 --> 24:11.007
Oh, I could be

24:11.108 --> 24:13.312
doing alterations right now.

24:13.412 --> 24:15.282
Whoa... Whoaaa!

24:15.383 --> 24:17.988
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

24:18.088 --> 24:22.664
<i>♪ I got pickles in my pocket</i>
<i>and I don't care who knows... ♪</i>

24:22.765 --> 24:25.436
Help me! Help me!
Help me, please!

24:25.537 --> 24:27.340
(Shawn) Watch out!

24:27.440 --> 24:29.044
(Ricardo) Dividing
the width of the truck

24:29.144 --> 24:30.346
by the width of the road,

24:30.446 --> 24:31.883
I calculate
a 99% chance of death!

24:31.983 --> 24:33.653
(Shawn) Jin, did you hear him?

24:33.753 --> 24:36.358
Jin, did you hear him regarding
our chances of survival?

24:36.458 --> 24:38.596
Jin, stop the engine!
Jin, stop this truck!

24:38.696 --> 24:42.203
Stop the truck! Jin! Jin!

24:49.217 --> 24:51.823
Captain, look!
We saved 12 seconds!

24:51.923 --> 24:57.033
No more shortcuts allowed!
No more shortcuts allowed.

24:57.133 --> 25:00.574
Okay, the theater is
on the next block. Get ready.

25:00.674 --> 25:03.212
Tanks on and follow my orders.

25:03.312 --> 25:04.915
- Any questions?
- What?

25:05.015 --> 25:06.753
Oh, hi. What did I miss?

25:06.853 --> 25:08.455
The street!

25:09.825 --> 25:12.531
(all yelling)

25:14.134 --> 25:17.306
Oh, Captain, are we there yet?

25:17.406 --> 25:20.914
- Not yet.
- Hmm...

25:25.356 --> 25:26.926
Whoa!

25:28.295 --> 25:31.401
- Wow!
- Wh... What is it?

25:31.501 --> 25:34.140
I don't know... Ricardo?

25:34.240 --> 25:38.148
It could be potassium or copper
acetate, maybe lithium chlorate.

25:38.248 --> 25:41.622
But that would only make sense
for the flames, not the smoke.

25:41.722 --> 25:44.762
I need to run tests.
At home. With <i>mi mama.</i>

25:44.862 --> 25:47.333
Arsonist,
we're coming to get you!

25:47.433 --> 25:50.907
Yeah! We're gonna kick
your flaming multicolored butt!

25:51.007 --> 25:54.047
Yeah!
(laughing)

25:54.147 --> 25:55.951
- Hmm.
- Captain, what's going on?

25:56.051 --> 25:59.090
Some arsonists like to come back
to the scene of the crime,

25:59.190 --> 26:00.594
so keep your eyes peeled.

26:00.694 --> 26:03.566
(Georgia) Keep my eyes peeled,
got it.

26:03.666 --> 26:05.369
Hmm...

26:07.975 --> 26:09.612
Who is that?

26:09.712 --> 26:12.651
(high-pitched voice) Only the
most luminous star on Broadway:

26:12.751 --> 26:15.389
Laura Divine.
(clears throat)

26:15.489 --> 26:18.095
Captain Neil, Chief of
the New York Police Department.

26:18.195 --> 26:19.665
Shawn Nolan.

26:19.765 --> 26:21.468
Happy to have you on
the fire investigation, Captain.

26:21.569 --> 26:24.440
With you here, the police,
led by yours truly,

26:24.542 --> 26:26.211
can now focus
on finding the missing firemen.

26:26.311 --> 26:27.548
Glad to be of service, Captain.

26:27.648 --> 26:29.484
Amazing!
We secured the perimeter,

26:29.585 --> 26:31.488
and there are no civilians
inside the building.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.626
- Empty!
- Thank you, Captain Neil.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.362
Okay, I'll go see
what we're up against.

26:35.462 --> 26:38.001
- Joe, stretch a line.
- Right away, Captain.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.172
Ah!

26:40.272 --> 26:42.678
Really hope no one saw that.

26:44.347 --> 26:45.784
(grunts)

26:51.662 --> 26:53.867
Slow down, Joe!
Did you even check the...

26:53.967 --> 26:55.035
Aaah!

26:55.135 --> 26:57.473
(sighs)
The water pressure.

26:58.141 --> 26:59.745
(screaming)

27:00.446 --> 27:01.582
(laughs)

27:01.682 --> 27:02.985
That's one crazy hose.

27:03.085 --> 27:04.320
It's not the hose.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.258
- (screaming)
- (Jin) Stay calm!

27:06.358 --> 27:07.861
Stay calm!

27:07.961 --> 27:10.466
Okay, panic! Panic!

27:10.567 --> 27:13.873
I miss my mama!
I want to go...

27:14.842 --> 27:16.211
(screaming)

27:16.311 --> 27:18.650
It will be fine!
I'm coming, buddy!

27:18.750 --> 27:20.085
Eeeh...

27:29.304 --> 27:31.441
(panting)

27:31.542 --> 27:33.478
You said you had training.

27:33.580 --> 27:36.051
- I've been training for years.
- Where, clown school?

27:36.151 --> 27:38.690
Never mind. Come with me.
We're gonna water the front.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.594
But if the smoke
contains cyanogen,

27:40.694 --> 27:43.098
you'll die of hypoxia
in only 29 seconds!

27:43.198 --> 27:46.037
That's why I need you
to collect smoke samples.

27:46.137 --> 27:49.210
And that's why I'm going home!

27:49.310 --> 27:51.381
- (birds chirping)
- Great!

27:51.481 --> 27:54.989
Okay, we all know
that firemen who go inside
burning theaters disappear,

27:55.089 --> 27:57.260
they vanish,
but that will not happen to us

27:57.360 --> 28:00.299
because we will stay outside
watering the front
until the fire is out.

28:00.399 --> 28:04.107
Then and only then will we
go inside and look for clues.

28:04.207 --> 28:06.211
Okay?
Jin, extend the ladder.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.181
- Extend the ladder!
- Ugh!

28:08.282 --> 28:09.685
(sighs)

28:11.154 --> 28:15.730
On it like a bonnet.
Let's get vertical, people.

28:15.830 --> 28:18.870
Top floor: ladies' hosiery,

28:18.970 --> 28:20.540
Brylcreem,

28:20.640 --> 28:23.011
and arsonists.

28:23.111 --> 28:25.517
(whimpering)

28:28.589 --> 28:31.696
(dramatic music)

28:38.977 --> 28:41.816
(panting)

28:44.253 --> 28:46.358
Get a load of me.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.529
- I'm a natural.
- Oh!

28:48.629 --> 28:51.234
Jin, wake up!
Wake up, please!

28:51.334 --> 28:54.007
- He's asleep! Jin!
- Stop, Jin!

28:54.107 --> 28:56.244
- Hold on!
- Whoa!

28:56.344 --> 28:59.017
(clattering)

28:59.117 --> 29:01.555
(both grunting)

29:02.524 --> 29:05.229
(coughs)

29:08.135 --> 29:10.439
(coughs)

29:10.540 --> 29:12.410
How is this possible?

29:12.511 --> 29:13.913
I have no idea!

29:14.013 --> 29:15.917
Back up.
We shouldn't be in here.

29:16.017 --> 29:17.888
That wasn't the plan.
We're getting out now!

29:17.988 --> 29:20.025
Captain!
Captain, I saw something move.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.129
- Never mind that now. Come on!
- I got this!

29:22.229 --> 29:24.535
No, no, no! Joe, that's an...
Oh, for Pete's sake!

29:24.635 --> 29:26.404
What is it,
ignore the captain day?

29:26.505 --> 29:30.245
(coughing, rapid breathing)

29:32.016 --> 29:34.487
(dramatic music)

29:34.588 --> 29:36.525
Ahh!

29:39.832 --> 29:41.368
(coughs)

29:41.468 --> 29:43.271
(panting)

29:43.372 --> 29:45.577
I know you're here somewhere!

29:45.677 --> 29:47.380
You show yourself!

29:47.480 --> 29:49.918
(panting)

29:51.555 --> 29:54.093
(hissing)

29:54.193 --> 29:56.899
<i>I thought I disposed</i>
<i>of all of your kind.</i>

29:56.999 --> 29:58.569
You... You don't scare me.

29:58.669 --> 30:00.139
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

30:00.239 --> 30:03.078
Aaahh!

30:03.178 --> 30:06.552
In the name
of the great city of New York,

30:06.652 --> 30:09.290
you're...
you're under arrest!

30:09.390 --> 30:11.394
<i>How cute. Here.</i>

30:11.494 --> 30:13.866
- Catch.
- Oh!

30:15.002 --> 30:16.371
Aaah!

30:16.471 --> 30:18.041
(loud orchestral music)

30:18.141 --> 30:19.578
Ah!

30:21.214 --> 30:22.617
What was that?

30:22.717 --> 30:24.220
(shaky breathing)

30:24.320 --> 30:25.623
The arsonist.

30:25.723 --> 30:27.493
Were you planning
on dancing with him?

30:27.594 --> 30:28.863
Stop that!

30:28.963 --> 30:30.165
We have to get out of here.

30:30.265 --> 30:32.336
Right now! Come on!

30:37.313 --> 30:38.583
(coughing)

30:38.683 --> 30:40.787
Oh, thank goodness!
They're alive!

30:40.887 --> 30:42.389
They're alive, everyone!

30:42.490 --> 30:45.797
- Come quickly! Quickly!
- (coughing, gasping for air)

30:47.166 --> 30:48.903
You...

30:49.003 --> 30:52.911
- (Jin) You just saw a ghost!
- (Ricardo) A ghost?

30:53.011 --> 30:54.982
Okay, that's where
I draw the line. The occult?

30:55.082 --> 30:57.052
- I am done!
- I don't know what it was.

30:57.153 --> 30:59.858
What I do know is I almost
caught the arsonist.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.762
Hey, Captain, I was just
telling them abo...

31:01.862 --> 31:03.866
Telling them what?
That it was a fiasco?

31:03.966 --> 31:05.804
Actually, Comandante,
I would say it's a success

31:05.904 --> 31:07.439
considering we are still alive.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.010
Of course you're alive.
You ran!

31:09.110 --> 31:13.084
True, but in my defense,
I didn't get very far.

31:13.185 --> 31:14.120
Firemen go in together,

31:14.220 --> 31:16.057
stay together,
come out together.

31:16.157 --> 31:18.729
- That's how this works.
- Yes, Comandante.

31:18.830 --> 31:21.836
And Jin, explain to me
how you fell asleep.

31:21.936 --> 31:26.010
Not me, Jackson.
The Cheetah never falls as...

31:26.110 --> 31:27.848
(snores)

31:27.948 --> 31:28.916
(sighs)

31:29.016 --> 31:32.223
What? Oh, hi.
What did I miss?

31:32.323 --> 31:33.860
Oh... Okay.

31:33.960 --> 31:38.669
Sometimes I "faint"
when my emotions are too strong.

31:38.769 --> 31:41.007
I was "fired" by the cab company

31:41.107 --> 31:44.013
for "allegedly"
running over a newsstand.

31:44.113 --> 31:47.186
I guess I "should" have
told you, Captain.

31:47.286 --> 31:48.756
(long exhale) Hmm.

31:48.856 --> 31:50.793
Anybody got anything else
to tell me?

31:50.894 --> 31:53.165
- Mm-mm.
- No, Captain.

31:53.265 --> 31:54.935
We won't disappoint you again,
Captain.

31:55.035 --> 31:56.739
I wasn't talking to you, Joe.

31:56.839 --> 31:58.709
You lied to me, and that's it.

31:58.809 --> 32:01.982
I don't wanna see you
around here ever again.

32:03.719 --> 32:05.757
(clears throat)
Captain, Nolan.

32:05.857 --> 32:08.228
My men haven't seen
any more signs of smoke.

32:08.328 --> 32:10.600
You're clear to enter
and start your investigation.

32:10.700 --> 32:12.269
Thank you, Captain Neil.

32:12.369 --> 32:14.975
I'll use the stage door.

32:17.914 --> 32:19.718
Captain! Captain!

32:19.818 --> 32:21.555
Go back to wherever
you came from, Joe.

32:21.655 --> 32:25.530
I just wanna say you're right.
I'm not a real fireman... yet.

32:25.630 --> 32:27.433
But it's all I've ever wanted.

32:27.534 --> 32:30.940
I've read every single book
and I train every single day,

32:31.040 --> 32:34.715
but firefighting for real is...
well, it's a lot different.

32:34.815 --> 32:36.585
Of course it's a lot different.
It's not a game.

32:36.685 --> 32:37.954
And pretending
you were a fireman

32:38.054 --> 32:39.758
put all our lives at risk.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.697
I'm a father, Joe.

32:42.797 --> 32:44.635
I need to go home at night.

32:44.735 --> 32:46.037
You understand me?

32:46.137 --> 32:48.308
Yeah. Yeah. Believe me, I do.

32:48.408 --> 32:50.914
But I really wanna help you
stop the arsonist.

32:51.014 --> 32:53.251
Please, please give me
another chance.

32:56.357 --> 32:58.128
(sighs)

33:01.669 --> 33:03.773
Hmm.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.977
(door creaks)

33:06.077 --> 33:09.216
Complete honesty from
here on in. Do you understand?

33:09.317 --> 33:12.089
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

33:12.189 --> 33:14.828
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Now follow me.

33:14.928 --> 33:17.166
(under her breath) Yes!

33:18.368 --> 33:19.871
Cheetah loves that guy.

33:19.972 --> 33:23.378
He's the cat's pajamas.
(snores)

33:28.522 --> 33:29.958
Oh...

33:30.058 --> 33:32.029
(Shawn) What is going on?

33:32.129 --> 33:34.668
This isn't normal, is it?

33:34.768 --> 33:36.170
No...

33:36.271 --> 33:39.243
We're about 40 miles
from normal.

33:39.343 --> 33:41.381
- Um...
- Oh!

33:41.481 --> 33:42.984
Sorry.

33:43.084 --> 33:44.855
(uncomfortable chuckle)

33:46.291 --> 33:50.232
(Shawn) Everything is burnt to
a crisp and yet still standing.

33:50.332 --> 33:53.238
How could the fire
burn the entire auditorium

33:53.338 --> 33:55.475
but not destroy
the rest of the theater?

33:55.576 --> 33:57.079
That's the question.

33:57.179 --> 33:58.516
Mm-hm...

33:58.616 --> 34:01.922
It's burning, but it's cold.

34:02.022 --> 34:04.594
- Don't touch it...
- Oops.

34:04.695 --> 34:06.932
Unless I say you can.

34:07.032 --> 34:09.170
Could have been worse...

34:09.270 --> 34:10.974
(gasps)

34:11.074 --> 34:13.813
- (chuckles nervously)
- Good grief...

34:14.280 --> 34:15.482
Okay...

34:15.583 --> 34:19.825
To collect clues,
you have to use your senses.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.198
Touch... Sight.

34:23.298 --> 34:25.168
Sound...

34:25.268 --> 34:27.874
(retching)

34:27.974 --> 34:29.778
I didn't say taste.

34:29.878 --> 34:31.882
I was gonna say smell.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.953
(sneezes)

34:36.525 --> 34:38.896
Do you think that's
what happened to the firemen?

34:38.996 --> 34:41.401
I... I mean, vaporized?

34:41.501 --> 34:43.104
Hmm. One step at a time.

34:43.204 --> 34:45.877
First we have to figure out
the origin of the fire

34:45.977 --> 34:47.079
to know what happened.

34:47.179 --> 34:48.949
The origin, got it.

34:49.050 --> 34:50.653
Each fire has a story.

34:50.753 --> 34:53.224
We are looking for various
marks and patterns

34:53.324 --> 34:55.963
imprinted by the smoke,
heat, and fire.

34:56.064 --> 34:58.134
And when we find these patterns,

34:58.234 --> 35:01.407
we can trace the path of fire
back to its origin.

35:01.508 --> 35:03.546
Good golly.

35:03.646 --> 35:05.248
Hey!

35:05.349 --> 35:06.685
Am I boring you?

35:06.785 --> 35:08.421
- Dad!
- What?

35:08.522 --> 35:10.092
Uh, had, ha...

35:10.192 --> 35:12.062
I had... I have... Pfff!

35:12.162 --> 35:13.866
I have something to show you.
Come here!

35:13.966 --> 35:15.970
Uh...
This better be good, kid.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.807
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good.
Come here. Look.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.613
Hurry up. Come on.

35:20.713 --> 35:22.584
Look! Look at the impact!

35:22.684 --> 35:24.320
(Shawn) Whoa...

35:24.420 --> 35:27.226
Whatever it was,
it was thrown from here...

35:27.326 --> 35:30.098
From the stage.
He's not an arsonist.

35:30.198 --> 35:32.871
I mean, he is, but he sees
himself as a performer...

35:32.971 --> 35:35.877
Doing a show,
with lights and music.

35:35.977 --> 35:38.883
Interesting... but just a theory

35:38.983 --> 35:42.557
unless we can figure out
what caused that impact.

35:42.657 --> 35:44.393
Hmm.

35:44.493 --> 35:45.362
This?

35:45.462 --> 35:46.698
Hmm?

35:46.799 --> 35:49.070
The arsonist threw it at me.

35:51.407 --> 35:52.944
Mm-hm.

35:53.044 --> 35:56.217
You just found
the origin of the story.

35:57.620 --> 35:58.889
Well done, son.

35:58.989 --> 36:01.562
I like that you call me "son."
(chuckles)

36:01.662 --> 36:03.999
Firemen are a big family.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.538
Let's take this back
to the firehouse.

36:06.638 --> 36:09.477
Huh. Origin of the story!

36:09.578 --> 36:12.015
Yes! Ooh!

36:12.116 --> 36:13.919
(clears throat)
Sorry...

36:14.019 --> 36:16.157
Something in my throat.

36:17.226 --> 36:19.063
(Shawn) Hey, Joe, come on!

36:19.163 --> 36:20.800
(locker door bangs shut)

36:20.900 --> 36:22.537
Ah, this is great!

36:22.637 --> 36:25.977
We'll give it to Ricardo first
thing in the morning to analyze.

36:26.077 --> 36:28.248
I haven't seen you
this happy in a long time.

36:28.348 --> 36:31.120
Yeah? Well, you've known me
since this morning.

36:31.220 --> 36:34.093
Oh, of course. It's just,
uh, I feel like I've known you

36:34.193 --> 36:35.696
my, you know, my whole life.

36:35.797 --> 36:36.698
Yeah, really?

36:36.799 --> 36:40.138
- Oh, God!
- Ow!

36:40.238 --> 36:41.608
Say hello to the brave men

36:41.708 --> 36:44.079
who are going to bring
the arsonist to justice!

36:44.180 --> 36:45.248
(reporters ask questions)

36:45.348 --> 36:46.919
You called the press, Jimmy?

36:47.019 --> 36:49.089
Sorry. City Hall leaks
like a sieve.

36:49.190 --> 36:51.528
Let today put an end
to the rumors

36:51.628 --> 36:54.868
about there being fewer
and fewer firemen to protect us!

36:54.968 --> 36:56.972
- See, here...
- Oh!

36:57.072 --> 37:00.011
... is Joe,
a truly unique fireman.

37:00.111 --> 37:01.481
He's strong.

37:01.582 --> 37:03.117
He's a real man.

37:03.218 --> 37:05.790
Don't look at me.
You look into the camera.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.392
You're working
for my re-election.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.831
- Look happy. Now go!
- You're crushing my hand! Oh!

37:09.931 --> 37:12.002
Don't forget to vote
Jimmy Murray.

37:12.102 --> 37:13.539
Polls open on Tuesday!

37:13.639 --> 37:15.576
The show must go on!

37:15.676 --> 37:19.416
Captain, Jimmy is using
this crisis to get re-elected.

37:19.518 --> 37:21.420
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

37:21.522 --> 37:24.160
Okay. I... I think
he's the arsonist!

37:24.260 --> 37:26.030
(chuckles)
Jimmy? No way.

37:26.130 --> 37:28.434
He'd sell out his own
grandmother to get re-elected.

37:28.536 --> 37:31.040
Actually, he did. She's doing
three years in Sing Sing...

37:31.140 --> 37:33.812
But arson?
Nah, he's not that kind of guy.

37:33.913 --> 37:36.184
- I know you're friends, but...
- Don't run, Joe.

37:36.284 --> 37:40.292
- Firemen walk with purpose.
- But I am walking.

37:40.392 --> 37:43.666
It's an expression, son. It
means don't jump to conclusions.

37:43.766 --> 37:46.070
Oh, yeah, no, I knew that.
I knew that.

37:46.170 --> 37:48.208
No, you didn't.
But I like your spirit.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.878
Alright, Joe, go home.

37:49.978 --> 37:53.218
Come on. Tomorrow will be
critical and I need you rested.

37:53.318 --> 37:55.790
And, yeah, I'm happy.

37:55.890 --> 37:58.394
I've missed all this.

38:00.833 --> 38:02.871
I knew you did.

38:02.971 --> 38:05.375
And you gave it all up for me.

38:06.043 --> 38:07.145
Hoh! Hoh!

38:07.246 --> 38:09.083
Gotta fly!

38:09.183 --> 38:12.523
(lively jazz music)

38:19.436 --> 38:21.140
Oh!

38:27.052 --> 38:29.390
Oh! Hey! Hey! Ember!

38:29.490 --> 38:30.993
- Ember!
- (barks)

38:31.093 --> 38:33.666
Hey! Hey! Hey, Ember!

38:33.766 --> 38:36.270
- Yes! Yes! I'm home!
- Hey!

38:36.370 --> 38:38.107
Hooo! My little
doggie doggie-doodoo.

38:38.207 --> 38:40.478
How are ya?
Did you girls have a nice day?

38:40.580 --> 38:42.917
What's this smile
you're giving me. That's sweet.

38:43.017 --> 38:45.055
Hmm?

38:45.957 --> 38:47.894
(panting)

38:47.994 --> 38:50.432
Let's go see what Georgia's
been up to, shall we?

38:50.533 --> 38:54.239
She won't believe
the day I've had.

38:56.812 --> 38:59.049
Upstairs.

39:00.085 --> 39:01.655
Hey, Georgia, I'm back!

39:01.755 --> 39:04.126
I'll be right up!

39:10.873 --> 39:12.710
(panting)

39:12.810 --> 39:14.446
(Georgia) Hey, Ember!

39:15.616 --> 39:17.887
Stall him!
Stall him, please.

39:17.987 --> 39:19.824
(Shawn) Georgia?

39:23.097 --> 39:25.770
(knocking)
Are you there, Georgia?

39:27.974 --> 39:29.343
(barking)

39:29.443 --> 39:30.646
How was your day?

39:30.746 --> 39:32.015
(whimpers) Ruff!

39:32.115 --> 39:33.819
Yeah, mine was
pretty rough too.

39:33.919 --> 39:36.090
(chuckles)
Can I come in?

39:36.558 --> 39:38.328
(grunts)

39:38.428 --> 39:40.700
- Wha...?
- (whimpers)

39:42.002 --> 39:44.774
- Hey, Dad. How was your day?
- What?

39:44.874 --> 39:47.780
I'll be with you
in one second?

39:47.880 --> 39:49.517
Did you see that, Ember?

39:49.617 --> 39:51.153
(whimpers)

39:51.253 --> 39:53.692
Gotta switch to decaf.

39:55.629 --> 39:58.167
(panting)

39:58.267 --> 40:01.207
Wow. You're so good
under pressure.

40:01.307 --> 40:03.077
(whimpers)

40:03.177 --> 40:05.181
Dad, tell me everything
that happened

40:05.281 --> 40:06.885
with the corduroy crisis.

40:06.985 --> 40:08.388
The what? Oh, right!

40:08.488 --> 40:10.225
The corduroy crisis!

40:10.325 --> 40:12.029
Oh! Oh! It was...

40:12.129 --> 40:14.466
It was... terrifying.

40:14.567 --> 40:17.674
The lines, they were going
the wrong way.

40:17.774 --> 40:20.846
- And there was the texture...
- Oh, wow...

40:20.946 --> 40:22.550
What?

40:22.650 --> 40:25.355
I just think you're amazing,

40:25.455 --> 40:28.996
and I think I'm lucky
to have you as my dad.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.833
(soft chuckle)

40:30.933 --> 40:32.603
Well, it'll be over soon,

40:32.704 --> 40:35.241
and we'll get back
to our quiet,

40:35.341 --> 40:37.980
safe and peaceful little life.

40:38.081 --> 40:40.519
Tsk. I can't wait.

40:44.694 --> 40:47.466
(dramatic music)

40:48.301 --> 40:49.704
<i>Sorry, boys.</i>

40:49.804 --> 40:52.677
<i>Last-minute change</i>
<i>in the program.</i>

40:52.777 --> 40:55.616
<i>I have to deal</i>
<i>with the last four of you.</i>

40:55.716 --> 40:59.356
<i>Then I'll be ready</i>
<i>for my grand opening.</i>

40:59.456 --> 41:08.441
<i>But this time, all of New York</i>
<i>will be my stage.</i>

41:18.261 --> 41:20.566
(gasps)

41:23.371 --> 41:25.910
(Shawn, whispering)
Have a good day, my love.

41:26.010 --> 41:27.847
(yawns) Dad!

41:27.947 --> 41:29.349
Dad, how are you?

41:29.450 --> 41:31.420
(clears throat)
I've been thinking.

41:31.521 --> 41:34.059
In... in... in... my sleep,
in my dreams.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.063
Why don't you take Ember
with you today?

41:36.163 --> 41:37.967
- Huh?
- She'd love it.

41:38.067 --> 41:39.403
Look how happy she is!

41:39.504 --> 41:41.073
- (barks)
- Aren't you so happy, Ember?

41:41.173 --> 41:44.379
Oh, you're so happy!
Yes, you are. You're so happy.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.385
I... I can't take her.
Who would look after you?

41:47.486 --> 41:50.191
Dad, stop treating me
like a baby. Don't you trust me?

41:50.291 --> 41:52.395
- Of course I do, but...
- Then prove it.

41:52.496 --> 41:54.099
Take her. It'll be good
for my independence.

41:54.199 --> 41:56.437
Are you all right, Peanut?
Do you want me to call a doctor?

41:56.538 --> 41:59.076
Oh, no, no, I'm good.
(forced laugh) Huh. Hmm...

41:59.176 --> 42:04.386
- You'll stay home all day?
- Tsk. Just like yesterday!

42:04.486 --> 42:06.825
Okay, then. Ember, let's go!

42:06.925 --> 42:09.062
(growls)

42:09.163 --> 42:10.900
Bye, Ember.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.603
See you later.

42:12.703 --> 42:15.743
Yes, I will.
Oh, yes, I will.

42:20.385 --> 42:22.289
- Yoo-hoo!
- Huh!

42:22.389 --> 42:24.594
- (laughs)
- You again?

42:24.694 --> 42:27.967
Argh! Do I look like a taxi cab?

42:28.067 --> 42:30.038
(yelling)

42:43.464 --> 42:46.403
(gasps)
What in the world...?

42:46.505 --> 42:48.174
<i>Buenos dias, Comandante.</i>

42:48.274 --> 42:51.447
Hey, chief! We gonna nab this
no-goodnik fire ghost or what?

42:51.548 --> 42:54.988
Morning, Captain!
One cream, two sugars, right?

42:55.088 --> 42:57.627
Hmm. Yeah, that's right...

42:57.727 --> 42:59.664
We came in early to get
a jump-start on things.

42:59.764 --> 43:02.570
- Hmm.
- Oh, what a sweet doggie.

43:02.670 --> 43:07.212
- Hello, boy. What's your name?
- It's Ember. She's a girl.

43:07.312 --> 43:09.551
Oh, Ember.
I'm so happy you're here.

43:09.651 --> 43:10.853
We're gonna have an amazing day.

43:10.953 --> 43:11.721
(barks)

43:11.821 --> 43:14.092
So that's how it's gonna be.

43:14.193 --> 43:15.563
(growls)

43:15.663 --> 43:18.735
Captain, Rick is analyzing
the fireball.

43:18.835 --> 43:21.006
He's trying to find out
why it didn't explode.

43:21.106 --> 43:24.179
Inside the ball,
there's a mixture of sulfur,

43:24.279 --> 43:26.450
charcoal
and potassium nitrate...

43:26.551 --> 43:28.555
plus a trace of nitro glycerin
and sorbents.

43:28.655 --> 43:29.991
Translation, please.

43:30.091 --> 43:31.928
(grunts)

43:32.028 --> 43:33.397
Gunpowder and dynamite.

43:33.497 --> 43:35.401
- (spits)
- Oh, hey, don't worry, Captain.

43:35.501 --> 43:37.607
The glass is unbreakable.

43:37.707 --> 43:40.278
- Oh, I see.
- And over here...

43:40.378 --> 43:43.317
Jin is making some amazing
improvements to the truck.

43:43.417 --> 43:47.727
It's Cheetah.
I already added my hanging dice
and my wooden-bead seat cover.

43:47.827 --> 43:49.898
So, Captain, can I drive?

43:49.998 --> 43:53.371
- Of course you can't drive.
- What? But I'm the best driver!

43:53.471 --> 43:54.874
(snores)

43:54.974 --> 43:58.281
Am I the only one
who sees this as a problem?

43:58.381 --> 44:00.451
Jin is awfully fast
when he's awake.

44:00.553 --> 44:02.022
And he does know
all the quickest routes.

44:02.122 --> 44:05.629
Amazingly, I need a driver
who's always awake.

44:05.729 --> 44:09.169
- (snoring)
- So, look what we've installed.

44:09.269 --> 44:10.639
- (bell dinging)
- Ow!

44:10.739 --> 44:13.044
What? Oh, hi.
What did I miss?

44:13.144 --> 44:14.914
Nothing. You can drive.

44:15.014 --> 44:16.952
Skiddle-dee-do!

44:17.052 --> 44:18.655
The Cheetah is back!

44:18.755 --> 44:22.295
Captain Neil delivered all
the evidence compiled so far.

44:22.395 --> 44:26.470
Photos, samples,
even audio recordings.

44:26.571 --> 44:29.276
There's only the one theater
left on Broadway.

44:29.376 --> 44:30.813
<i>The mystery is,</i>

44:30.913 --> 44:32.817
<i>how does the arsonist</i>
<i>get into the theaters</i>

44:32.917 --> 44:34.621
<i>when there are</i>
<i>police everywhere?</i>

44:34.721 --> 44:38.394
Isn't it obvious?
He's a ghost!

44:38.494 --> 44:39.496
Huh? A ghost?

44:39.597 --> 44:41.200
Aah! Oh...

44:41.300 --> 44:44.574
(scoffs) Can you drop
the silly ghost theory, Jin?

44:44.674 --> 44:46.911
Okay. Let me try.
Nope, I can't. It's too good.

44:47.012 --> 44:50.552
Enough! We only have one more
chance to catch the arsonist.

44:50.653 --> 44:52.489
- Ricardo?
- Hmm?

44:52.590 --> 44:54.326
You take a shower.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.063
And then keep analyzing
that fireball.

44:56.163 --> 44:57.465
Okay, Comandante.

44:57.566 --> 45:00.004
Jin turn this truck
into a rocket.

45:00.104 --> 45:01.373
Done and done, Captain.

45:01.473 --> 45:02.843
- Good briefing, Joe.
- Thank you.

45:02.943 --> 45:05.916
You come with me.
I'm gonna train you.

45:06.016 --> 45:08.622
(humming happily)

45:15.769 --> 45:18.709
Welcome to the fire
simulation room.

45:18.809 --> 45:21.715
Ooh... It's really hot.
(small cough)

45:21.815 --> 45:24.386
(Shawn) Temperatures can reach
2,000 degrees.

45:24.486 --> 45:27.927
Relax. Get to know
your worst enemy.

45:28.027 --> 45:29.697
He is fierce...

45:29.797 --> 45:31.634
- Oh!
- Powerful.

45:31.735 --> 45:33.204
Hey! Where you going?

45:33.304 --> 45:36.611
Okay. I can do this. Give it to
me. What have you got?

45:36.711 --> 45:38.782
- I can do this.
- Okay. Okay, Joe, relax.

45:38.882 --> 45:41.320
I know you're strong
and in excellent condition,

45:41.420 --> 45:43.457
but technique... Wait, wait!

45:47.098 --> 45:48.602
That was a back draft.

45:48.702 --> 45:51.741
I told you, don't run.
Walk with purpose.

45:51.841 --> 45:56.417
But firemen have to be...
fast and brave.

45:56.518 --> 45:57.620
(grunts)

45:57.720 --> 46:00.058
You take recklessness
for bravery.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.995
(panting)

46:02.095 --> 46:03.297
(lively jazz music)

46:03.397 --> 46:05.268
- Aaah! Oh!
- Reckless.

46:05.368 --> 46:08.508
You didn't analyze the situation
or assess the risk.

46:08.608 --> 46:11.146
That's not bravery,
it's just stupid.

46:11.246 --> 46:13.885
Um, I think I get it.
Can you pull me up now?

46:13.985 --> 46:16.658
I'll think about it
a little longer.

46:16.758 --> 46:21.467
Captain... Captain,
that's not funny. Come on...

46:21.568 --> 46:23.270
Captain!

46:24.607 --> 46:26.143
(Shawn) Very impressive, Joe.

46:26.243 --> 46:28.347
- You're a fast learner.
- Oh, thank you, Captain.

46:28.447 --> 46:29.851
That means so much
coming from you.

46:29.951 --> 46:31.621
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't get distracted.

46:31.721 --> 46:33.658
- You keep the nozzle turning.
- Yeah, yeah!

46:33.759 --> 46:36.664
Of course, Captain.
Sorry, Captain.

46:36.765 --> 46:39.737
It's funny,
you remind me of my daughter.

46:39.837 --> 46:41.608
- Huh?
- She's about your age.

46:41.708 --> 46:43.812
Really? Yeah, that is funny.
(forced chuckle)

46:43.912 --> 46:46.083
Hmm. Yeah, she wanted
to be a fireman too.

46:46.183 --> 46:48.822
But you don't think girls
should be firemen?

46:48.922 --> 46:50.859
No, of course
they should be firemen.

46:50.959 --> 46:53.364
So why didn't you teach her
what you're teaching me?

46:53.464 --> 46:55.803
- It's complicated.
- Why, because she's a girl?

46:55.903 --> 46:57.640
No, because she's my daughter.

46:57.740 --> 47:00.512
I mean, I love her
and I worry about her
every second of my life.

47:00.612 --> 47:04.119
- Aw.
- And I have to protect her.

47:04.219 --> 47:06.624
I mean, she's lots of attention,
she's delicate,

47:06.724 --> 47:08.929
she's sensitive,
the world freaks her out...

47:09.029 --> 47:10.699
Aaaah!

47:10.799 --> 47:13.003
Hey! What the heck was that?

47:13.104 --> 47:14.139
Sorry, Captain.

47:14.239 --> 47:17.412
Yeah, you'll see
how fragile I am.

47:17.513 --> 47:19.784
(sirens wailing)

47:19.884 --> 47:22.757
It's the Lyceum,
Laura Divine's theater.

47:22.857 --> 47:24.594
- Hurry, Jin!
- The Cheetah's on it!

47:24.694 --> 47:26.463
- (snores)
- Hoh! Hoh! Wake up, Jin!

47:26.564 --> 47:28.134
(Georgia) On it!

47:28.234 --> 47:30.706
Hey! Easy on the ol'
pie hole there.

47:30.806 --> 47:32.175
Well, that works...

47:32.275 --> 47:33.310
Ricardo, how's it going?

47:33.410 --> 47:35.114
<i>Are you getting any closer?</i>

47:35.214 --> 47:37.051
Hold on.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.528
(muffled) Can I call you later?

47:41.628 --> 47:42.596
(alarm ringing)

47:42.696 --> 47:44.099
(Divine) Pauline, turn that off!

47:44.199 --> 47:46.571
(Pauline) Right away,
Miss Divine!

47:46.671 --> 47:49.577
(Divine) Okay. From the top!

47:49.677 --> 47:52.148
(cabaret-style music)

47:52.248 --> 47:54.987
<i>♪ Baby, look at me ♪</i>

47:55.087 --> 47:56.991
<i>♪ And tell me what you see... ♪</i>

47:57.091 --> 48:00.799
All that smoke on stage
must have tripped the alarm.

48:00.899 --> 48:02.703
I thought you shut
all the theaters, Captain Neil.

48:02.803 --> 48:06.109
We did! We've kicked
Miss Divine out four times!

48:06.210 --> 48:08.648
And this is the fifth time
she's come back.

48:08.748 --> 48:10.686
<i>♪ Don't you know who I am? ♪</i>

48:10.786 --> 48:12.823
<i>♪ Remember my name ♪</i>

48:12.923 --> 48:15.762

48:15.863 --> 48:18.869

48:18.969 --> 48:20.539
<i>♪ I feel it co... ♪</i>

48:20.639 --> 48:22.008
Stop! Stop! Stop!

48:22.108 --> 48:24.780
I have replicas of every tiara
she's worn

48:24.881 --> 48:28.087
since she took Broadway by storm
20 years ago, mm-hm!

48:28.187 --> 48:30.091
The star is never
out of the spotlight!

48:30.191 --> 48:33.464
You think I like hanging here
like a side of beef?

48:33.565 --> 48:36.571
- Reset me!
- Yes, Miss Divine!

48:36.671 --> 48:38.808
Right away, Miss Divine!

48:38.909 --> 48:41.814
Joe, go talk to that poor lady
working the ropes

48:41.915 --> 48:43.184
and see if she has
any information.

48:43.284 --> 48:45.154
- Hmm.
- I'll take the drama queen.

48:45.254 --> 48:47.793
- Oh! Where are we going?
- I meant Miss Divine.

48:47.893 --> 48:50.398
Ahem! Of course. Hmm!

48:52.636 --> 48:55.041
<i>♪ Baby, look at me ♪</i>

48:55.141 --> 48:57.613
♪ And tell me what... ♪
Whoa!

48:57.713 --> 49:00.552
Ms. Divine!
Captain Nolan from the FDNY.

49:00.652 --> 49:03.357
- May I have a word?
- Lights!

49:03.457 --> 49:05.562
Talk fast or there's a chance

49:05.662 --> 49:08.568
I may lose
my signature good humor.

49:08.668 --> 49:10.672
The police evacuated
your theater

49:10.772 --> 49:12.208
for your own safety,
Miss Divine.

49:12.308 --> 49:14.079
Huge fan!

49:14.179 --> 49:16.149
(Shawn groans)

49:17.151 --> 49:19.055
There is a very good chance

49:19.155 --> 49:21.561
that this theater will go up
in smoke like all the others.

49:21.661 --> 49:23.364
My premiere is in three days.

49:23.464 --> 49:25.969
Have you ever heard
what the show must do?

49:26.069 --> 49:27.640
- (soft chuckle)
- Umm... Go on?

49:27.740 --> 49:28.975
That's right!

49:29.075 --> 49:30.746
I don't know
who you think you are

49:30.846 --> 49:32.115
or where you come from, but...

49:32.215 --> 49:33.284
- Ahem!
- Oh!

49:33.384 --> 49:35.522
So, Pauline, is it?

49:35.622 --> 49:37.927
- You work for Miss Divine?
- Yes.

49:38.027 --> 49:40.498
Her personal assistant
for two months now,

49:40.599 --> 49:42.570
but I've been kicking around
Broadway for 20 years.

49:42.670 --> 49:43.838
Uh-huh.

49:43.939 --> 49:45.842
Just don't have much
to show for it.

49:45.943 --> 49:49.784
Anyway, you must be part
of the mayor's heroic fire team.

49:49.884 --> 49:51.554
That's right. I'm Joe.

49:51.654 --> 49:54.392
Oh, I saw your photo
in the paper.

49:54.492 --> 49:56.931
I never forget a handsome face.

49:57.031 --> 49:59.537
(laughs) No, no... Ahem.

49:59.637 --> 50:00.839
Oh.

50:00.939 --> 50:03.377
Oh... Uh, thank you.

50:03.477 --> 50:05.248
I'm so glad you're here, Joe.

50:05.348 --> 50:06.818
I'm a little jittery.

50:06.918 --> 50:09.089
Actually, very.

50:09.189 --> 50:11.594
But nothing scares Miss Divine.

50:11.694 --> 50:13.832
Say it!
Unless I'm the arsonist?

50:13.932 --> 50:18.541
Uh, well, I'm just doing my job,
Miss Divine,
covering all my bases.

50:18.642 --> 50:20.378
I grew up cleaning houses

50:20.478 --> 50:23.183
and babysitting for rich people
who told me:

50:23.284 --> 50:26.290
"Now, don't you kiss the baby,
Miss Laura."

50:26.390 --> 50:28.962
"Don't you eat off the china,
Miss Laura."

50:29.062 --> 50:30.832
I saved every penny I earned

50:30.932 --> 50:33.404
so I could get out of there
and come to Broadway.

50:33.505 --> 50:35.308
- And when a dancer quit...
- (gasps)

50:35.408 --> 50:38.748
...guess who was ready
to step in and save the day?

50:38.848 --> 50:40.953
- You were.
- Yes.

50:41.053 --> 50:44.627
Now, respectfully,
get the heck out of my theater.

50:44.727 --> 50:46.631
Pull me back up, Pauline!

50:46.731 --> 50:50.004
Right away, Miss Divine!
(grunts)

50:50.104 --> 50:53.645
Miss Divine, I can't let you
continue to rehearse.

50:53.745 --> 50:55.348
You gotta come with me.

50:55.448 --> 50:56.751
Would you say something?

50:56.851 --> 50:59.322
Will you sign my face?

50:59.422 --> 51:00.759
Not that!

51:00.859 --> 51:03.798
I wanna fly! Yes!

51:04.332 --> 51:06.504
Yes! Higher!

51:06.604 --> 51:08.173
Yes, Miss Divine!

51:08.273 --> 51:09.677
I wanna fly!

51:09.777 --> 51:10.779
(grunts)

51:10.879 --> 51:12.148
Higher!

51:12.248 --> 51:14.520
- (clicking)
- (Pauline) Whoa!

51:14.620 --> 51:17.425
(screams)

51:20.632 --> 51:22.435
Pauline!

51:22.536 --> 51:23.705
(shouts)

51:23.805 --> 51:28.447
You just clipped
the wings of an angel!

51:28.548 --> 51:30.519
(sobs)

51:30.619 --> 51:33.057
Oh... I feel like a failure
in my life.

51:33.157 --> 51:34.927
There's nothing I can do.

51:35.027 --> 51:37.498
Oh, Pauline,
please don't worry.

51:37.599 --> 51:39.637
I'm... I'm pretty sure
she's gonna recover.

51:39.737 --> 51:41.406
(Divine) Get me
out of here right now!

51:41.507 --> 51:44.479
Miss Divine, there is
no need to get upset.

51:44.580 --> 51:46.316
Everything is gonna be fine.

51:46.416 --> 51:48.521
(whispering) Where's the crane?
Don't worry, Miss Divine!

51:48.621 --> 51:49.824
Get me the crane.

51:49.924 --> 51:52.996
See?
Sounds like she'll recover.

51:53.097 --> 51:56.236
- I mess everything up.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

51:56.336 --> 51:59.610
Maybe this is a sign
that it's time
you follow your own dreams.

51:59.710 --> 52:01.948
I never gave up on mine.

52:02.048 --> 52:04.820
Easy for you to say.
You're a man.

52:04.920 --> 52:07.158
Not really.

52:07.926 --> 52:09.830
(whispering) I'm all girl.

52:09.930 --> 52:11.734
My name is Georgia.

52:11.834 --> 52:13.671
Georgia?

52:13.772 --> 52:15.942
What an amazing costume.

52:16.042 --> 52:17.980
The mustache is very convincing.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.585
It's my dog's butt hair.
It was the only way.

52:20.685 --> 52:23.825
If I catch the arsonist, they'll
have to change the rules.

52:23.925 --> 52:25.729
Then I'll be
the first fireman woman.

52:25.829 --> 52:29.837
Oh...
The first... firefighter.

52:29.937 --> 52:31.808
Firefighter.

52:31.908 --> 52:34.179
Yeah! I love that.

52:34.279 --> 52:37.452
- You're very inspiring.
- Hmm.

52:37.553 --> 52:40.124
(humming)

52:44.399 --> 52:45.869
(sighs)

52:45.969 --> 52:49.409
It's not the first time
you've seen him here?

52:49.510 --> 52:50.946
No.

52:51.046 --> 52:53.818
He's always sneaking around.

52:53.918 --> 52:56.557
Hmm. Okay.

52:57.225 --> 52:59.930
Psst! Be careful...

53:00.699 --> 53:02.368
Joe.

53:03.437 --> 53:06.176
(humming)

53:09.917 --> 53:12.689
(humming)

53:21.941 --> 53:24.379
(panting)

53:29.456 --> 53:30.157
Hmmm.

53:30.257 --> 53:32.462
(plays simple melody)

53:32.563 --> 53:36.136
(dramatic organ music)

53:36.771 --> 53:39.008
The music...

53:39.108 --> 53:41.112
- Aah!
- (coughing)

53:41.213 --> 53:43.585
I'm so sorry, Captain.
Are you okay?

53:43.685 --> 53:45.020
I'm really, really sorry,

53:45.120 --> 53:46.958
but we have to go back
to the firehouse, okay?

53:47.058 --> 53:48.795
- Can you breathe?
- (coughs)

53:48.895 --> 53:50.765
I hope you have
a good explanation.

53:50.866 --> 53:54.573
I do. I really do. I am so sorry
for your... for your throat.

53:58.982 --> 54:01.186
Experiment number 26:

54:01.286 --> 54:04.492
integrating the music recorded
at the scene of the fires.

54:05.529 --> 54:06.731
Here we go.

54:06.831 --> 54:10.004
(music starts)

54:10.104 --> 54:11.641
Oh, you were right, Joe.

54:11.741 --> 54:14.112
The music,
it activates the fireball.

54:14.212 --> 54:15.481
Jiminy cricket!

54:15.582 --> 54:18.120
(Ricardo) Oh...
I've never seen a material

54:18.220 --> 54:20.625
create light
in reaction to sound.

54:20.725 --> 54:23.363
- The work of a true artist.
- Or a ghost...

54:23.463 --> 54:25.301
- Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu.
- Mm-hm?

54:25.401 --> 54:27.438
- From the future.
- (sighs)

54:27.539 --> 54:30.712
No, no, no. Ember.
Ember, come back. Sit here.

54:30.812 --> 54:33.952
- Sit here with me.
- Approaching 90 seconds.

54:34.052 --> 54:35.555
(clinking)

54:35.655 --> 54:37.325
(all) Oh! Oh! Oh!

54:37.425 --> 54:41.499
Ember! Ember? Captain, Jin,
get down, get down!

54:41.601 --> 54:43.036
What's going on?
What's happening?

54:43.136 --> 54:44.439
The light has hypnotized them!

54:44.540 --> 54:47.311
The last five notes
cause the explosion!

54:47.411 --> 54:50.652
- (Ricardo) I cannot move.
- Rick! Rick, it's spreading.

54:50.752 --> 54:52.355
We have to get them
out of here right now!

54:52.455 --> 54:54.560
I cannot move.
I cannot move!

54:54.660 --> 54:57.265
Hey, it's okay. It's okay
to be scared. I'm scared too.

54:57.365 --> 55:00.304
But you can still be brave.
Rick. Rick, look at me.

55:00.404 --> 55:03.511
Go in together, stay together,
come out together.

55:03.611 --> 55:05.147
Come on!

55:06.182 --> 55:09.322
Okay. Okay.

55:14.299 --> 55:17.606
Oh, wow. I didn't expect that.

55:21.547 --> 55:23.785
(yelling)

55:31.968 --> 55:34.573
(panting)

55:34.673 --> 55:36.844
Oh, I did it. I did it!

55:36.944 --> 55:39.215
Yes, I did it!

55:40.317 --> 55:43.390
Looks like the training
paid off, Dad.

55:45.361 --> 55:48.200
Captain Neil, we know
how to stop the arsonist.

55:48.300 --> 55:50.337
I repeat, we know
how to stop the arsonist.

55:50.437 --> 55:52.208
<i>(Neil) Oh! That's fabulous.</i>

55:52.308 --> 55:54.412
We are on our way
to Laura Divine's theater.

55:54.513 --> 55:56.951
But Captain Nolan wants you
to evacuate all of Midtown.

55:57.051 --> 55:58.888
<i>(Neil) I'm all over it!</i>

55:58.988 --> 56:01.527
Guys, I'm sorry
I was hard on you.

56:01.627 --> 56:05.602
I expected nothing, and at first
that's exactly what I got.

56:05.702 --> 56:08.206
But this turned out to be
a pretty darn good crew.

56:08.307 --> 56:10.077
Ricardo, you saved us in there.

56:10.177 --> 56:11.514
Thank you, Captain.

56:11.614 --> 56:14.520
But perhaps this bravery
was always inside of me,

56:14.620 --> 56:16.089
and it was Joe
who revealed it with...

56:16.189 --> 56:18.360
(vomiting)

56:20.064 --> 56:23.270
Big truck... sick.
I... sorry.

56:23.370 --> 56:25.174
- I'm better now.
- Ugh.

56:25.274 --> 56:28.413
And you too.
Amazing work, Joe.

56:29.349 --> 56:30.484
Thank you.

56:30.585 --> 56:32.656
(siren wailing)

56:40.505 --> 56:43.343
Captain Nolan.
Good to have you here.

56:43.443 --> 56:45.649
We'll have the perimeter
secured in a quick 10 minutes.

56:45.749 --> 56:48.220
We have everything
under control.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.192
Thank you, Captain Neil.
I'll get my men in position too.

56:51.292 --> 56:53.698
- Are you ready?
- (all) Yes, Captain!

56:59.777 --> 57:03.518
Okay, team, I want 10 lines,
inch and three quarters.

57:03.618 --> 57:05.655
Open all the nozzles
in the auditorium

57:05.755 --> 57:07.391
and lock them
between the seats.

57:07.491 --> 57:09.462
I want all of them
targeting the stage.

57:09.563 --> 57:12.034
As soon as the alarm starts,
we turn on the water

57:12.134 --> 57:14.405
and we drown that arsonist.

57:16.677 --> 57:18.648
- Great job team.
- Thank you.

57:18.748 --> 57:20.050
Yeah! (laughs)

57:20.150 --> 57:21.119
(Shawn) Hey, Captain Neil.

57:21.219 --> 57:23.457
Georgia!
Oh, sorry!

57:23.558 --> 57:24.526
Joe!

57:24.626 --> 57:26.664
Pauline!

57:26.764 --> 57:28.968
- Where you going?
- I got fired.

57:29.068 --> 57:30.739
But I'm happy!

57:30.839 --> 57:33.745
You were absolutely right.
It's time for a change.

57:33.845 --> 57:36.584
- Time for me to shine.
- Well, I'm happy for you.

57:36.684 --> 57:37.986
Good luck.

57:38.086 --> 57:39.890
You too, Georgia.

57:39.990 --> 57:42.128
Well, then, this is goodbye.

57:42.228 --> 57:45.267
I just need to fetch my lucky
slippers and then I'm off.

57:45.367 --> 57:47.371
I'm done with New York.

57:47.471 --> 57:49.475
Okay. Well, hurry.

57:49.576 --> 57:51.547
The police are shutting down
all of Midtown.

57:53.450 --> 57:55.154
(pickle guy mutters)

57:55.254 --> 57:57.124
(officer)
Everybody move back.

57:57.224 --> 57:59.362
Hey, you, pickle guy!
Get outta here!

57:59.462 --> 58:01.266
Oh yeah, sure.
I understand. I understand.

58:01.366 --> 58:03.336
- Oh...
- Don't boss me around!

58:03.437 --> 58:05.140
- Hmm...
- (alarm ringing)

58:05.240 --> 58:07.244
He's here. Turn on the water.

58:07.344 --> 58:09.583
Darn it! We've been tricked!

58:09.683 --> 58:12.188
The fire isn't coming
from the auditorium this time!

58:12.288 --> 58:14.125
- Where is it?
- Everywhere!

58:14.225 --> 58:15.895
It's a trap! Abort!

58:15.995 --> 58:18.868
But Pauline just went inside!
I have to save her!

58:18.968 --> 58:20.037
(sighs)

58:20.137 --> 58:22.976
Get ready! We're going in!

58:25.247 --> 58:27.753
(ladder rattles)

58:34.833 --> 58:36.269
(coughing) Come on!

58:36.369 --> 58:38.173
Pauline!
Where'd she go?

58:38.273 --> 58:40.410
Pauline!
Can you see her?

58:40.512 --> 58:42.849
- (coughs)
- You go right, I'll go left!

58:42.949 --> 58:46.122
And use your hose so you don't
get lost in the smoke.

58:46.222 --> 58:48.528
Okay, Captain.

58:53.771 --> 58:54.840
Pauline!

58:54.940 --> 58:57.011
(coughs)
Pauline!

58:57.111 --> 58:58.380
Pauline!

58:58.480 --> 59:00.952
- (panting)
- Pauline, I've got you.

59:01.052 --> 59:02.756
(grunts)

59:02.856 --> 59:06.362
- I thought I would perish.
- (coughs)

59:07.666 --> 59:09.302
- Aaah!
- Pauline!

59:09.402 --> 59:12.241
Save me! Save me!

59:12.341 --> 59:15.481
- Pauline!
- Don't let go!

59:15.582 --> 59:20.792
Georgia! Georgia, I can't...
Georgia!

59:21.927 --> 59:24.398
Pauline!
(grunts)

59:24.499 --> 59:26.637
- Stop!
- But Pauline's down there!

59:26.737 --> 59:28.708
- She might still be alive!
- It's too late.

59:28.808 --> 59:30.545
No, I can't risk
losing you both.

59:30.645 --> 59:33.116
We have to get out.
That is an order!

59:33.216 --> 59:34.920
Come on!

59:36.991 --> 59:38.828
Come on!

59:51.352 --> 59:53.056
(sighs)

59:54.392 --> 59:56.830
(Ember whimpers softly)

1:00:00.572 --> 1:00:03.844
I wanted to be a fireman
to save people.

1:00:05.882 --> 1:00:11.025
Sixteen years ago, just after
I'd been made captain,

1:00:11.125 --> 1:00:12.261
there was a terrible house fire

1:00:12.361 --> 1:00:14.432
with a young couple
trapped inside.

1:00:15.535 --> 1:00:17.271
When we got there,
we hacked at the walls,

1:00:17.371 --> 1:00:19.910
trying to get them out,
but it was too late.

1:00:20.010 --> 1:00:21.547
I couldn't save them.

1:00:21.647 --> 1:00:26.256
I didn't know how I could go on.
I was devastated.

1:00:26.356 --> 1:00:27.893
And I needed to...

1:00:27.993 --> 1:00:30.598
I needed to be there
for my daughter.

1:00:31.567 --> 1:00:34.573
She was so little then and I...

1:00:34.673 --> 1:00:38.380
Anyway, my battalion chief
told me that if I...

1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:40.450
wanted to be a real fireman,

1:00:40.552 --> 1:00:43.925
I'd have to accept that
sometimes bad things happen

1:00:44.025 --> 1:00:46.864
and there's nothing more
you could do.

1:00:46.964 --> 1:00:49.435
You have to let it go.

1:00:50.337 --> 1:00:52.207
Shawn!

1:00:52.308 --> 1:00:54.278
Congratulations!

1:00:54.378 --> 1:00:56.584
- For what?
- The auditorium!

1:00:56.684 --> 1:01:00.424
- It's saved!
- We lost someone, Jimmy.

1:01:00.525 --> 1:01:02.027
And the arsonist
is still on the loose.

1:01:02.127 --> 1:01:05.167
Oh, I know, I know.
Terrible, terrible.

1:01:05.267 --> 1:01:07.304
I gotta do something.
You know what I'm gonna do?

1:01:07.404 --> 1:01:11.012
I'm gonna put the police.
The police are taking over.

1:01:11.112 --> 1:01:14.085
What? No!
I have to stop the arsonist.

1:01:14.185 --> 1:01:15.655
Jimmy, don't do this.

1:01:15.755 --> 1:01:17.258
We still don't know
where the firemen are.

1:01:17.358 --> 1:01:19.763
- Hey!
- The police will find them.

1:01:19.863 --> 1:01:22.101
As for the arsonist, he doesn't
have any more theaters to burn.

1:01:22.201 --> 1:01:25.742
He's finished. And I have places
to go and people to see.

1:01:25.842 --> 1:01:30.050
So, Shawnie, get some rest,
and thanks for the great show.

1:01:30.150 --> 1:01:31.587
Show?

1:01:31.687 --> 1:01:34.826
Oh, by the way,
I've been re-elected!

1:01:34.926 --> 1:01:38.233
<i>♪ Four more years</i>
<i>Four more years... ♪</i>

1:01:38.333 --> 1:01:41.272
- I know he's your friend...
- Yeah, whatever.

1:01:41.372 --> 1:01:43.978
We stick to him
like white on rice.

1:01:44.078 --> 1:01:45.815
Like stink on diapers.

1:01:45.915 --> 1:01:47.552
- Hmm.
- Too much, right?

1:01:47.652 --> 1:01:49.523
Yeah, too much.

1:01:53.631 --> 1:01:55.802
(soft jazz music)

1:01:58.039 --> 1:01:59.810
(teeth chatter)

1:01:59.910 --> 1:02:00.912
Hmm.

1:02:01.012 --> 1:02:05.320
- (teeth chatter)
- Shhh! Hmm.

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:08.026
(whispering)
Three, two, one...

1:02:09.328 --> 1:02:11.299
(grunting)

1:02:11.399 --> 1:02:13.971
- Hmm?
- (groaning)

1:02:15.842 --> 1:02:19.482
- Don't.
- No, I got this, I got this.

1:02:21.954 --> 1:02:24.091
Okay, get out of the way, son.

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:27.966
- (grunting)
- No, no! No!

1:02:28.066 --> 1:02:30.705
(grunting)

1:02:31.807 --> 1:02:35.147
(distorted yelling)

1:02:35.247 --> 1:02:37.451
(yells)

1:02:37.552 --> 1:02:39.388
(distorted yelling)

1:02:39.488 --> 1:02:41.192
(distorted yell)

1:02:41.292 --> 1:02:43.063
(distorted barking)

1:02:43.163 --> 1:02:45.033
(distorted yelling)

1:02:45.133 --> 1:02:46.670
Aaah!

1:02:46.770 --> 1:02:48.306
- Dad!
- Dad?

1:02:48.406 --> 1:02:50.444
- Cupcake!
- Cupcake?

1:02:50.545 --> 1:02:53.651
(both yelling)

1:02:53.751 --> 1:02:55.822
- Get it open!
- There's no handle!

1:02:55.922 --> 1:02:59.261
Get it open!
Get it open. Get it open.

1:03:00.732 --> 1:03:03.036
Good job, Ember.

1:03:04.438 --> 1:03:06.275
(echoing) Cupcake?

1:03:06.376 --> 1:03:07.779
(Divine muttering)

1:03:07.879 --> 1:03:09.983
At least she hasn't lost
her voice.

1:03:10.083 --> 1:03:11.620
Jokes, huh?

1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:13.557
We'll see how hard you laugh

1:03:13.657 --> 1:03:16.062
when you're scrubbing toilets
at Yankee Stadium.

1:03:16.162 --> 1:03:19.101
(Divine yelling)

1:03:19.201 --> 1:03:21.072
Cupcake, look at you!

1:03:21.172 --> 1:03:24.746
- (grunting)
- Look at you, my cupcake.

1:03:24.846 --> 1:03:26.482
What are you trying to do
to my fiancée?

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:31.225
Fiancée? I think there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

1:03:31.325 --> 1:03:34.331
We, uh, we... we kind of thought
you were the arsonist.

1:03:34.432 --> 1:03:36.069
The arsonist? Me?

1:03:36.169 --> 1:03:38.908
It's just you were always
sneaking around the theater.

1:03:39.008 --> 1:03:42.816
Only because I love this woman
and we can't be seen together.

1:03:42.916 --> 1:03:45.521
Oh, yeah, of course,
I totally understand.

1:03:45.621 --> 1:03:47.792
- Society has to change.
- No, no, no, not that.

1:03:47.892 --> 1:03:49.796
She doesn't wanna
be seen with me.

1:03:49.896 --> 1:03:51.900
Of course I don't wanna
be seen with him!

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.004
It's bad for my reputation
to be seen

1:03:54.105 --> 1:03:56.142
with a sleazy
double-dealing scoundrel.

1:03:56.242 --> 1:03:58.681
But I'm your sleazy
double-dealing scoundrel.

1:03:58.781 --> 1:04:02.756
- (barks)
- Oh, cupcake.

1:04:04.425 --> 1:04:06.095
Captain! Look!

1:04:06.195 --> 1:04:08.534
The firemen must be
down here somewhere.

1:04:08.634 --> 1:04:10.237
(Jin) Hey, Cap,
everything alright?

1:04:10.337 --> 1:04:12.474
Jin! Get down here
and help Jimmy and Laura!

1:04:12.575 --> 1:04:15.247
Call Captain Neil.
We found something.

1:04:15.347 --> 1:04:18.186
Sorry, Jimmy, but we have to go
search this subway tunnel.

1:04:18.286 --> 1:04:21.727
Congratulations. She'll make a
charming first lady of New York.

1:04:21.827 --> 1:04:24.666
When she's back in one piece.

1:04:24.766 --> 1:04:27.539
Out of my sight!

1:04:27.639 --> 1:04:30.243
(Divine) Aaah! My arm!
Oh! Oh, it hurts.

1:04:30.343 --> 1:04:32.749
(Georgia) Hey, hey, Captain,
where are we?

1:04:32.849 --> 1:04:36.155
(Shawn) The track
for the BMT train.

1:04:39.128 --> 1:04:40.631
Okay. Okay.

1:04:40.731 --> 1:04:43.303
- Which way, Ember?
- (sniffing)

1:04:43.403 --> 1:04:45.006
(barks)

1:04:45.106 --> 1:04:46.743
Go! Go!

1:04:50.016 --> 1:04:51.854
(barks)

1:05:01.974 --> 1:05:03.243
Joe...

1:05:03.343 --> 1:05:07.919
I think we just found
the lair of the arsonist.

1:05:10.423 --> 1:05:12.027
(Georgia) What is this place?

1:05:12.127 --> 1:05:15.835
(Shawn) It's an air
distribution chamber.

1:05:15.935 --> 1:05:18.306
This must be
where he rehearsed his show.

1:05:28.193 --> 1:05:30.698
(Ember whining)

1:05:30.798 --> 1:05:33.571
It's hooked up to the fan
like a turbine.

1:05:33.671 --> 1:05:35.373
Must take a crazy
amount of energy

1:05:35.473 --> 1:05:37.211
to create those fireballs.

1:05:37.311 --> 1:05:39.315
Hmm.

1:05:43.924 --> 1:05:45.360
- Captain, come here!
- Huh?

1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:48.767
Rejection letters.
From every theater on Broadway.

1:05:48.868 --> 1:05:51.673
"You belong in a loony bin,
not a theater."

1:05:51.773 --> 1:05:54.345
Yeah... PhD in chemistry.

1:05:54.445 --> 1:05:57.685
The scientist is a failed artist
who's looking for revenge.

1:05:57.785 --> 1:05:59.823
(gasps)

1:06:00.725 --> 1:06:02.194
Broadway was just the rehearsal.

1:06:02.294 --> 1:06:04.265
The real performance
is happening tonight.

1:06:04.365 --> 1:06:06.870
From the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1:06:06.970 --> 1:06:09.441
(whimpers, barks)

1:06:11.212 --> 1:06:12.815
What?

1:06:20.096 --> 1:06:21.967
Hey! I think we found them!

1:06:22.067 --> 1:06:24.104
- They're alive!
- Oh, we did it!

1:06:24.204 --> 1:06:25.808
We did it! We did it!
We did it!

1:06:25.908 --> 1:06:27.277
We certainly did.

1:06:27.377 --> 1:06:30.016
I couldn't be
more proud of you, son.

1:06:30.952 --> 1:06:33.122
Well, actually...

1:06:33.222 --> 1:06:35.160
(chuckles)

1:06:35.260 --> 1:06:36.863
...daughter?

1:06:43.944 --> 1:06:45.180
(whining)

1:06:45.280 --> 1:06:47.417
Look, I know...
I know it was crazy,

1:06:47.518 --> 1:06:49.789
I know I promised to give up
this dream, but I couldn't.

1:06:49.889 --> 1:06:52.227
And doing this was the only way
to prove myself.

1:06:52.327 --> 1:06:55.367
To you. To everyone.

1:06:55.467 --> 1:06:57.304
Well, no, you see,

1:06:57.404 --> 1:06:59.643
you said that Joe
is an excellent fireman!

1:06:59.743 --> 1:07:01.947
I mean... I mean, he's me,

1:07:02.047 --> 1:07:03.851
and I'm him, and when
you give me your blessing,

1:07:03.951 --> 1:07:05.420
they're gonna have to
change the rules.

1:07:05.521 --> 1:07:09.228
- No!
- What? No what?

1:07:09.328 --> 1:07:11.265
No, you can't be
a fireman, Georgia.

1:07:11.365 --> 1:07:13.403
No matter how good
and strong you are.

1:07:13.503 --> 1:07:16.309
- What do you mean?
- I will never allow it.

1:07:16.409 --> 1:07:19.181
Oh! But it wasn't a problem
when I was Joe.

1:07:19.281 --> 1:07:21.419
Yes, but it's a huge problem
when it's you.

1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:24.091
- The job is far too dangerous.
- I don't understand.

1:07:24.191 --> 1:07:26.028
You know it's all
I've ever wanted.

1:07:26.128 --> 1:07:28.333
You gave this passion to me.
It's in my blood!

1:07:28.433 --> 1:07:30.337
It's not in your blood!

1:07:32.642 --> 1:07:34.144
What do you mean?

1:07:35.781 --> 1:07:37.050
(sighs)

1:07:37.150 --> 1:07:40.524
I'm not your real father,
Georgia.

1:07:40.624 --> 1:07:43.797
Of... of... of course you are.

1:07:45.233 --> 1:07:47.170
I'm not.

1:07:49.208 --> 1:07:51.947
(sighs) Do you remember
when I told you

1:07:52.047 --> 1:07:55.788
about the couple
I couldn't save 16 years ago?

1:07:55.888 --> 1:07:58.226
Even though
they were trapped...

1:07:58.326 --> 1:08:01.800
they managed to pass
their baby daughter to me...

1:08:01.900 --> 1:08:04.673
three months old.

1:08:04.773 --> 1:08:06.977
Her name was Georgia.

1:08:07.077 --> 1:08:10.183
I swore to them
I would always protect her.

1:08:12.487 --> 1:08:14.592
(whimpers)

1:08:15.861 --> 1:08:17.965
If you become a fireman,

1:08:18.066 --> 1:08:20.203
I can't keep that promise.

1:08:20.303 --> 1:08:22.542
Look at the danger
you're in now.

1:08:22.642 --> 1:08:27.150
You used "girls can't be
firemen" to lock me up at home.

1:08:27.250 --> 1:08:29.956
That was the only way
I could think to protect you.

1:08:30.056 --> 1:08:32.729
- I'm sorry, I was wrong.
- (ball clanging)

1:08:32.829 --> 1:08:34.365
(barks)

1:08:34.465 --> 1:08:35.735
Georgia!

1:08:35.835 --> 1:08:38.072
(dramatic organ music)

1:08:42.114 --> 1:08:44.886
(Georgia) What happened?
What happened?

1:08:48.459 --> 1:08:51.198
(grunting softly)

1:08:51.733 --> 1:08:53.570
Dad! Dad!

1:08:53.670 --> 1:08:55.908
<i>People despise change.</i>

1:08:56.008 --> 1:08:58.179
<i>Even those</i>
<i>who are closest to you.</i>

1:08:58.279 --> 1:08:59.916
- (barks)
- No. Ember! Ember! Ember!

1:09:00.016 --> 1:09:02.822
Wait! Wait! No!
Ember, come back!

1:09:02.922 --> 1:09:04.793
Ember! Ember!

1:09:04.893 --> 1:09:06.563
Ember, wake up.
Wake up, Ember.

1:09:06.663 --> 1:09:08.801
<i>I hate little dogs.</i>

1:09:08.901 --> 1:09:10.971
<i>Sorry.</i>

1:09:17.985 --> 1:09:21.292
Wait... Pauline?

1:09:21.392 --> 1:09:24.198
Pauline is dead.

1:09:24.298 --> 1:09:27.471
My stage name is Supreme Fury.

1:09:27.572 --> 1:09:32.782
What'd you think of my
little death scene? Too much?

1:09:32.882 --> 1:09:35.386
We have the same enemies,
you and I.

1:09:35.487 --> 1:09:38.694
The ones who say
my art isn't art,

1:09:38.794 --> 1:09:40.731
that women can't fight fires.

1:09:40.831 --> 1:09:43.837
We are stuck
in their stupid world,

1:09:43.937 --> 1:09:46.777
held back just because
we wanna do something

1:09:46.877 --> 1:09:49.047
that's never been done before.

1:09:49.148 --> 1:09:52.955
Your father... is one of them.

1:09:54.959 --> 1:09:58.332
If we wait for them
to catch up,

1:09:58.432 --> 1:10:01.573
we could wait our entire lives.

1:10:01.673 --> 1:10:03.710
We don't have time for that.

1:10:03.811 --> 1:10:06.482
That's why we have to act now.

1:10:06.583 --> 1:10:10.925
We'll burn it all down
and start over.

1:10:12.628 --> 1:10:15.500
(panting)

1:10:15.601 --> 1:10:17.270
The thing is, Pauline...

1:10:17.370 --> 1:10:20.978
I might never be a fireman,
but I have the fire in my heart,

1:10:21.078 --> 1:10:23.617
and no one can change that.

1:10:23.717 --> 1:10:26.623
Not even my father.

1:10:26.723 --> 1:10:28.527
Wrong answer, sis.

1:10:28.627 --> 1:10:32.067
You're clearly not ready
for center stage.

1:10:32.167 --> 1:10:35.006
Too bad you'll miss
my grand finale.

1:10:35.106 --> 1:10:38.947
Dad, wake up! Dad! Dad!

1:10:41.853 --> 1:10:46.128
Dad! Dad, don't worry,
I'm gonna get you out of this.

1:10:46.228 --> 1:10:48.534
Dad, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

1:10:48.634 --> 1:10:50.370
Dad! Wake up!

1:10:50.470 --> 1:10:53.009
Dad! No!

1:10:53.109 --> 1:10:55.681
- No!
- (barks)

1:10:55.781 --> 1:10:57.184
- What?
- (barks)

1:10:57.284 --> 1:10:59.822
Oh, Ember!
Oh, thank you.

1:10:59.923 --> 1:11:01.492
Thank you, Ember.

1:11:01.593 --> 1:11:03.530
(grunts)

1:11:07.370 --> 1:11:08.774
(grunts)

1:11:15.855 --> 1:11:17.290
(barks)

1:11:20.096 --> 1:11:22.334
Oh, Dad. Dad, come back!
Come back, please!

1:11:22.434 --> 1:11:24.873
Dad, you can do this.
You can do this, Dad.

1:11:24.973 --> 1:11:27.277
(grunts)

1:11:29.414 --> 1:11:32.955
Dad! Dad!
Dad, come back! Please.

1:11:33.055 --> 1:11:35.026
(panting)

1:11:35.126 --> 1:11:37.531
(crying)

1:11:40.203 --> 1:11:41.438
I smell mangoes.

1:11:41.539 --> 1:11:43.977
- (coughs)
- (laughs)

1:11:44.077 --> 1:11:47.618
Oh... very funny. Very funny.

1:11:50.824 --> 1:11:53.396
You saved me.

1:11:53.496 --> 1:11:55.901
Just...
Just doing my job, Captain.

1:11:56.001 --> 1:11:58.306
Just doing my job.

1:12:00.443 --> 1:12:03.717
I'm so sorry I held you back.

1:12:05.921 --> 1:12:09.361
My captain told me that
if wanted to be a real fireman,

1:12:09.461 --> 1:12:13.002
I'd have to accept that
sometimes bad things happen,

1:12:13.102 --> 1:12:15.173
and there's nothing more
I can do.

1:12:15.273 --> 1:12:18.547
You have to let it go.

1:12:24.491 --> 1:12:26.228
The day that you were put
in my arms

1:12:26.328 --> 1:12:28.499
is the day my life began.

1:12:30.003 --> 1:12:31.573
I love you, Dad.

1:12:33.944 --> 1:12:35.614
Okay, you find Pauline,

1:12:35.714 --> 1:12:37.918
go find the team,
and call Captain Neil.

1:12:38.019 --> 1:12:40.123
Ember and I will release
the firemen.

1:12:40.223 --> 1:12:42.227
- (barks)
- Are you sure?

1:12:42.327 --> 1:12:45.734
Yeah, go save our city,
Georgia.

1:12:49.441 --> 1:12:52.515
Looks like I'm gonna have to
get used to this.

1:12:54.852 --> 1:12:57.925
<i>Captain Neil here.</i>
<i>Great job, everyone.</i>

1:12:58.025 --> 1:12:59.428
<i>We've stopped</i>
<i>the arsonist's van</i>

1:12:59.529 --> 1:13:01.365
<i>300 feet from</i>
<i>the Chrysler Building.</i>

1:13:01.465 --> 1:13:03.402
- Yes!
<i>- This is a great day</i>

1:13:03.502 --> 1:13:05.808
<i>for the city</i>
<i>and for New York's finest.</i>

1:13:05.908 --> 1:13:09.549
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on, I told you.

1:13:09.649 --> 1:13:12.020
- Mangoes and Ember's butt hair.
- Ugh!

1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:13.590
Did everything smell
like dog butt?

1:13:13.690 --> 1:13:15.393
Look, can we talk
about this later?

1:13:15.493 --> 1:13:16.896
I wanna be there for the arrest.

1:13:16.997 --> 1:13:18.600
But why, when your chances

1:13:18.700 --> 1:13:21.573
of actually becoming a fireman
are approximately zero percent?

1:13:21.673 --> 1:13:24.946
Life isn't about percentages,
Ricardo,

1:13:25.046 --> 1:13:27.283
and it can't be zero
'cause I'm doing it right now.

1:13:27.384 --> 1:13:29.622
- Boom!
- You inspire me...

1:13:29.722 --> 1:13:31.125
85 percent!

1:13:31.225 --> 1:13:33.229
Me too, Joe.
Georgia, I mean.

1:13:33.329 --> 1:13:34.766
Sorry, I gotta get used
to it, Joe.

1:13:34.866 --> 1:13:36.402
Georgia. Georgia. Georgia.

1:13:36.502 --> 1:13:39.776
<i>(Neil) Mayday! Mayday!</i>
<i>She's throwing fireballs.</i>

1:13:39.876 --> 1:13:42.447
<i>There's smoke everywhere.</i>
<i>Oh, I can't see anything!</i>

1:13:42.548 --> 1:13:45.186
No, no, no. We have to stop her.
We have to stop her!

1:13:45.286 --> 1:13:48.259
(dramatic organ music)

1:13:55.106 --> 1:13:56.442
Oh! The police cars!

1:13:56.543 --> 1:13:58.345
And the police!
They're hypnotized!

1:13:58.446 --> 1:14:01.653
And nobody to give me
a speeding ticket!

1:14:02.287 --> 1:14:03.690
(Ricardo) Oh, no, no!

1:14:09.101 --> 1:14:11.071
(coughs)

1:14:11.171 --> 1:14:13.844
- There she is!
- I see her.

1:14:31.278 --> 1:14:33.784
No, no, no, no, no!
Come back! Come back!

1:14:35.019 --> 1:14:36.623
(grunts)

1:14:37.457 --> 1:14:39.027
Oh! What is she doing?

1:14:39.127 --> 1:14:41.866
I've no idea,
but I think I'm in love.

1:14:41.966 --> 1:14:44.572
Oh, this is <i>no bueno.</i>

1:14:58.900 --> 1:15:01.271
- (engine roaring)
- (cackles)

1:15:01.371 --> 1:15:03.242
(tires screeching)

1:15:04.311 --> 1:15:06.750
(balls rattle)

1:15:11.860 --> 1:15:14.231
(hissing)

1:15:32.333 --> 1:15:35.273
(grunts)

1:15:40.316 --> 1:15:42.020
(brakes squealing)

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:43.523
Thank you for the ride, sir.

1:15:43.623 --> 1:15:47.163
Stop talking and save my city.

1:15:47.263 --> 1:15:49.669
Hey, Captain, you made it!

1:15:49.769 --> 1:15:53.175
- Where's Georgia?
- Oh... about that.

1:15:53.275 --> 1:15:54.745
There is only one elevator.

1:15:54.846 --> 1:15:57.383
And the stairs
are not finished yet.

1:15:58.185 --> 1:16:00.490
I need to get up there now!

1:16:01.993 --> 1:16:03.496
(hissing, clicking)

1:16:03.597 --> 1:16:07.605
Let the show begin!

1:16:10.209 --> 1:16:12.046
Seriously?

1:16:16.723 --> 1:16:19.795
Aaaah!

1:16:22.066 --> 1:16:23.570
Georgia!

1:16:23.670 --> 1:16:25.306
Ah...

1:16:30.817 --> 1:16:33.088
Oh, what...?

1:16:37.363 --> 1:16:39.167
What? Georgia...

1:16:39.267 --> 1:16:40.469
Georgia, where are you?

1:16:40.571 --> 1:16:42.307
- Come over here, quick!
- Georgia...

1:16:42.407 --> 1:16:44.712
Hurry up!

1:16:44.812 --> 1:16:47.450
Are you alright, Captain?

1:16:47.551 --> 1:16:50.089
No... My daughter is up there.

1:16:50.189 --> 1:16:51.626
Oh, dear heavens!

1:16:51.726 --> 1:16:53.162
- Not there....
- Listen to me, men.

1:16:53.262 --> 1:16:54.832
I want you to surround
the building.

1:16:54.932 --> 1:16:57.905
Here.
Another construction elevator.

1:16:58.005 --> 1:16:59.241
From up there I could...

1:16:59.341 --> 1:17:01.178
Get me some ropes and a grapnel.

1:17:01.278 --> 1:17:04.652
Uh... are you serious, Captain?

1:17:06.288 --> 1:17:08.492
(grunts)

1:17:08.593 --> 1:17:11.733
Georgia. Georgia!

1:17:16.174 --> 1:17:18.012
(grunts)

1:17:19.481 --> 1:17:21.351
Ah!

1:17:24.324 --> 1:17:25.928
(grunts)

1:17:26.028 --> 1:17:28.365
(panting)

1:17:35.446 --> 1:17:37.518
(hums)

1:17:37.618 --> 1:17:40.389
(organ music)

1:17:42.528 --> 1:17:44.999
90 seconds to stop her.

1:17:46.101 --> 1:17:47.905
(plays dramatic tune)

1:17:51.411 --> 1:17:53.182
Where are you, Pauline?

1:17:53.282 --> 1:17:55.019
85 seconds...

1:17:55.119 --> 1:17:56.522
There! Yes!

1:17:57.457 --> 1:17:59.528
(panting)

1:17:59.629 --> 1:18:03.603
No! Georgia, look around you.
Don't run.

1:18:03.703 --> 1:18:05.874
Please don't run.

1:18:05.974 --> 1:18:10.216
Don't run. Don't run, Georgia
Nolan. You're a firefighter.

1:18:10.316 --> 1:18:11.686
75 seconds.

1:18:11.786 --> 1:18:14.457
You walk with purpose.
Think.

1:18:14.558 --> 1:18:17.397
You won't make it in 70 seconds.
She's too high.

1:18:17.497 --> 1:18:19.568
Think.
Take a look around.

1:18:19.669 --> 1:18:21.204
65 seconds.

1:18:21.305 --> 1:18:23.108
The power!
Yes!

1:18:23.208 --> 1:18:25.847
Where's the plug?
Where's the plug?

1:18:25.948 --> 1:18:26.983
There!

1:18:27.083 --> 1:18:29.487
Yes! 60 seconds.

1:18:29.588 --> 1:18:30.891
Can I make it?

1:18:30.991 --> 1:18:34.598
Platform, pulley, ladder,
beam, ladder.

1:18:34.699 --> 1:18:38.238
It's possible. 55 seconds.

1:18:38.339 --> 1:18:40.610
That's great, my love.

1:18:45.286 --> 1:18:47.524
(grunts)

1:18:54.538 --> 1:18:58.012
(yelling)

1:19:00.651 --> 1:19:04.190
Yeah, yeah... No!

1:19:04.290 --> 1:19:07.531
No... No. Argh!

1:19:08.298 --> 1:19:10.069
Okay. Um...

1:19:13.008 --> 1:19:16.783
Easy. One foot
in front of the other.

1:19:16.883 --> 1:19:19.487
One foot in front of the other.

1:19:25.433 --> 1:19:27.203
Whoa!

1:19:27.303 --> 1:19:29.207
Ten.

1:19:29.307 --> 1:19:30.944
Nine.

1:19:31.044 --> 1:19:32.213
Eight.

1:19:32.313 --> 1:19:34.250
Seven. Six.

1:19:34.351 --> 1:19:35.821
Five.

1:19:35.921 --> 1:19:36.856
Four!

1:19:36.956 --> 1:19:37.991
Three.

1:19:38.092 --> 1:19:39.762
Two.

1:19:40.731 --> 1:19:43.001
(music stops)

1:19:43.102 --> 1:19:45.306
What? Argh!

1:19:45.406 --> 1:19:48.112
- Hey!
- Argh!

1:19:48.212 --> 1:19:51.118
Show's over. Huh.

1:19:51.218 --> 1:19:53.823
Yes!

1:19:57.296 --> 1:19:58.733
(grunts)

1:19:59.902 --> 1:20:01.973
(grunts)

1:20:05.514 --> 1:20:07.818
No! Georgia!

1:20:07.918 --> 1:20:09.889
Whoa...!

1:20:13.563 --> 1:20:17.103
Nobody stops my show, Georgia,
not even you.

1:20:17.203 --> 1:20:19.542
It's my time.

1:20:21.512 --> 1:20:23.449
(grunts)

1:20:23.550 --> 1:20:26.923
So we're gonna take it
from the top.

1:20:35.540 --> 1:20:37.644
(tires screeching)

1:20:37.744 --> 1:20:39.682
Cheetah. At your service.

1:20:39.782 --> 1:20:41.351
Need a lift, Captain?

1:20:41.451 --> 1:20:43.122
(chuckles)

1:20:43.222 --> 1:20:46.963
Pauline! Please stop!

1:20:50.035 --> 1:20:53.510
Pauline, you're too...
you're too close to the edge!

1:20:53.610 --> 1:20:57.083
Oh, you have no idea, honey.

1:20:57.951 --> 1:20:59.955
Aaaah!

1:21:05.232 --> 1:21:07.236
You ruined everything!

1:21:07.336 --> 1:21:09.608
We could have changed the world!

1:21:09.708 --> 1:21:12.380
We are changing it.

1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:15.119
We have the same fire
in our hearts.

1:21:15.219 --> 1:21:16.889
Don't you see?

1:21:16.989 --> 1:21:20.296
But... But you use yours
to harm people.

1:21:20.396 --> 1:21:22.467
I use mine to save them.

1:21:22.568 --> 1:21:23.870
Yeah?

1:21:23.970 --> 1:21:25.807
How are you gonna do that?

1:21:25.907 --> 1:21:28.847
Gonna drop me
like the last time?

1:21:29.815 --> 1:21:31.986
(panting, grunts)

1:21:33.523 --> 1:21:34.925
To calculate
the horizontal distance,

1:21:35.025 --> 1:21:36.929
I'm using 9.81 yards
per second...

1:21:37.029 --> 1:21:39.200
Oh, never mind, just go fast!

1:21:39.300 --> 1:21:41.371
Here comes the Cheetah!

1:21:41.471 --> 1:21:44.244
(all yell)

1:21:46.916 --> 1:21:50.122
(tires screeching)

1:21:54.698 --> 1:21:56.802
(laughs)
Ah!

1:21:56.903 --> 1:21:59.307
You see, Pauline?

1:21:59.407 --> 1:22:02.915
Firefighters are one big family.

1:22:03.482 --> 1:22:05.820
(screams)

1:22:07.223 --> 1:22:08.826
Thought maybe
you could use a hand.

1:22:08.927 --> 1:22:11.933
- Hi!
- That'd be nice.

1:22:12.033 --> 1:22:16.174
- How are you, Probie?
- Yeah, feelin' good.

1:22:16.274 --> 1:22:18.947
Feelin' good, Captain.

1:22:23.288 --> 1:22:25.259
Um... Uh...

1:22:26.428 --> 1:22:29.334
(footsteps approaching)

1:22:32.774 --> 1:22:34.678
Dad!

1:22:42.928 --> 1:22:45.600
Do I look like a firefighter?

1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:48.806
- You are a firefighter...
- Oh...

1:22:48.907 --> 1:22:52.346
I can't believe what
a beautiful woman you've become.

1:22:54.885 --> 1:22:58.626
I've wanted to give this to you
for the longest time.

1:22:58.726 --> 1:23:03.870
It's... It's everything that
I found out about your parents.

1:23:03.970 --> 1:23:07.076
And... now it's for you.

1:23:11.484 --> 1:23:13.255
Oh...

1:23:20.604 --> 1:23:23.275
Wow...
(chuckles)

1:23:23.375 --> 1:23:25.814
I look like my mother.

1:23:25.914 --> 1:23:28.485
And a little like your father.

1:23:28.586 --> 1:23:32.561
My dad's name is Shawn Nolan.

1:23:32.661 --> 1:23:33.930
He's the greatest dad
in the world

1:23:34.030 --> 1:23:36.268
and I wanna be just like him.

1:23:42.814 --> 1:23:44.852
(whines)

1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:47.390
- I love you, Joe.
- What?

1:23:47.490 --> 1:23:48.893
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

1:23:48.993 --> 1:23:50.897
But that... that Joe
was really something.

1:23:50.997 --> 1:23:53.569
- Always smelled of mangoes.
- Oh, cut it out!

1:23:53.670 --> 1:23:55.607
Ember, were you in
on all of this?

1:23:55.707 --> 1:23:58.278
Of course. It was all her...
idea... actually.

1:23:58.378 --> 1:24:00.850
(whimpers)

1:24:01.585 --> 1:24:03.790
(crowd cheering)

1:24:03.890 --> 1:24:06.127
I vowed to keep you safe

1:24:06.227 --> 1:24:08.866
and I was able to deliver
on that promise

1:24:08.967 --> 1:24:13.643
thanks to the heroic men
and women, heh, heh,

1:24:13.743 --> 1:24:16.114
who stand before you today.

1:24:16.214 --> 1:24:19.053
Don't look at me.
You look into the camera.

1:24:19.153 --> 1:24:21.324
Ow! You're crushing my hand.

1:24:21.424 --> 1:24:23.161
I know. I know.

1:24:23.261 --> 1:24:25.065
It's an honor

1:24:25.165 --> 1:24:28.338
to decorate each of them
with a gold medal,

1:24:28.438 --> 1:24:33.950
for their bravery in protecting
the greatest city on earth.

1:24:34.050 --> 1:24:35.887
We couldn't have done it
without you, Ricardo.

1:24:35.987 --> 1:24:38.191
Thank you, Captain.
Please wish me good luck.

1:24:38.291 --> 1:24:39.895
I'm going to college next year.

1:24:39.995 --> 1:24:43.836
Well, I'm 100% sure
you're gonna do great things.

1:24:43.936 --> 1:24:46.542
Although given my age
and my social issues,

1:24:46.642 --> 1:24:49.748
I wonder if I have a 93% chance
of being bullied and...

1:24:49.848 --> 1:24:53.288
- Ricardo?
- You are right. I can do it.

1:24:57.329 --> 1:24:59.702
You showed great courage, Jin.

1:24:59.802 --> 1:25:01.872
This is going right next
to my medallion.

1:25:01.972 --> 1:25:04.243
- You're driving a cab again?
- Yes, sir.

1:25:04.343 --> 1:25:06.014
I'm working on my emotions.

1:25:06.114 --> 1:25:09.688
Did I mention I'd like
to take your daughter out?

1:25:09.788 --> 1:25:11.124
Hey, Jin, pump the brakes.

1:25:11.224 --> 1:25:13.596
Oh! Sure. No problem, Captain.

1:25:13.696 --> 1:25:16.434
No, take all the time you need.

1:25:18.338 --> 1:25:19.675
Good job, Nolan.

1:25:19.775 --> 1:25:22.279
Thank you, Captain Nolan.

1:25:26.922 --> 1:25:28.626
(whispering) I love you.

1:25:28.726 --> 1:25:30.195
(whispering) I love you too.

1:25:30.295 --> 1:25:34.705
Oh... Now that's true
New York spirit.

1:25:34.805 --> 1:25:36.575
Excelsior!

1:25:36.675 --> 1:25:37.978
Everyone with me!

1:25:38.078 --> 1:25:39.815
Excelsior!

1:25:39.915 --> 1:25:41.284
I'm not crying.

1:25:41.384 --> 1:25:43.923
I just got some...
some pickle juice in my eye.

1:25:44.023 --> 1:25:46.194
You're crying!
(sobbing)

1:25:47.196 --> 1:25:49.400
- (alarm ringing)
- Huh?

1:26:22.333 --> 1:26:25.005
(pickle guy) Half-priced pickles
for everybody!

1:26:25.105 --> 1:26:27.711
Not you!
But everybody else!

1:26:27.811 --> 1:26:30.482
