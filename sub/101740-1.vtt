12:11.861 --> 12:15.778
Or we could force him to give upthe head of the snake right now.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.345
We don't torture.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.086
I didn't say "torture."

12:19.129 --> 12:20.522
I said "force."

12:20.565 --> 12:21.828
Tobias.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.656
Or we could coerce him

12:24.700 --> 12:26.876
or we could leverage him.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.228
With enough dirt to turn on his
boss so he goes away for life?

12:31.272 --> 12:33.056
You are such a killjoy.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.971
He's the only lead we got.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.495
If we can't turn him,
we don't have anything.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.064
Can we at least take
a look inside there,

12:41.108 --> 12:42.413
do a little recon?

12:42.457 --> 12:43.675
We look like two cops.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.373
You look like a cop.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.896
[chuckles]I look like crap.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.593
Or at least I looklike a guy

12:48.637 --> 12:52.684
who needs some cheappainkillers for his bum hip.

12:52.728 --> 12:55.078
Aren't you a little bitcurious about how it works?

12:55.122 --> 12:56.514
[dialing]

12:56.558 --> 12:58.168
Who are you calling?

12:58.212 --> 12:59.866
[phone ringing and buzzing]

13:01.781 --> 13:04.435
Really?

13:04.479 --> 13:06.742
If you're going inside,
I'm listening.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.138
You got ten minutes.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.661
You serious?
Yes.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.141
You couldn't get through
those zombies in ten minutes.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.494
[clears throat]

13:23.063 --> 13:24.934
[entry bell jingles]

13:27.589 --> 13:28.546
[sighs, clears throat]

13:28.590 --> 13:30.592
New patient?Yeah.

13:30.635 --> 13:33.638
Name, number, what's hurting?

13:33.682 --> 13:34.988
What's hurting?

13:35.031 --> 13:37.642
Reason for your visit.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.994
Yeah. You take insurance?

13:41.037 --> 13:42.169
Cash only.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.040
$250 up front.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.216
How long's the wait?

13:46.260 --> 13:47.565
Just have your money ready.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.317
Hey.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.972
How you doing?

14:03.016 --> 14:05.409
No, I don't mean to...

14:05.453 --> 14:07.890
I'm not trying to...

14:10.110 --> 14:11.328
What's your name?

14:12.982 --> 14:14.636
None of your business.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.944
Too many questions,
dude, let's go.

14:17.987 --> 14:18.901
No, stop.

14:21.556 --> 14:24.341
Sorry, I-I'm just...

14:24.385 --> 14:25.952
How old are you?

14:25.995 --> 14:26.953
[door opens, bell jingles]

14:26.996 --> 14:28.215
Oh, there you are,

14:28.258 --> 14:31.131
Uncle Ed, I wasworried sick about you.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.393
I'm sorry about Uncle Ed.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.482
He-He-He's-he's not all there,

14:34.525 --> 14:36.832
and you probably can see that.Yeah, I-I had a feeling.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.225
He-he just likes to wander.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.663
Yeah, let-- come on,
come on, Uncle Ed.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.534
You need somebody to talk
to your parents maybe?

14:43.578 --> 14:44.971
GIBBS:Ed, let's go home.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.364
Give me a sec.
I'm not trying to...

14:47.408 --> 14:48.452
Ooh, you okay?

14:48.496 --> 14:49.366
All right,
all right, out, out, out,

14:49.410 --> 14:50.585
both of you.

14:50.628 --> 14:53.370
[siren wailing in distance]

14:53.414 --> 14:54.632
Sorry, Gibbs, I don't know
what got into me in there.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.461
Really, y-you don't?

14:57.505 --> 14:59.942
Is your eye okay?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.117
Oh, no, no.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.902
What-what happenedto his car?

15:02.945 --> 15:04.251
Where'd his car go?How'd he get out so fast?

15:04.294 --> 15:05.426
We were only in there
a couple of minutes.

15:05.469 --> 15:06.906
Well, maybe-- just maybe--

15:06.949 --> 15:08.559
he heard you askingall those questions

15:08.603 --> 15:11.780
and he got his buttout of here!

15:11.823 --> 15:12.781
Well, we'll get him tomorrow.

15:12.824 --> 15:15.915
I mean, not-not we-- me.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.046
You can blame me
all you want,

15:17.090 --> 15:18.569
but did you see that
young girl in there?

15:18.613 --> 15:19.396
That could have been Emily!

15:19.440 --> 15:20.397
Forget her!

15:20.441 --> 15:21.398
What?!

15:21.442 --> 15:23.792
Forget Emily!

15:24.836 --> 15:26.926
Check your heart at the door.

15:26.969 --> 15:31.800
Otherwise, Tobias, you and me
are wasting our time here.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.155
You're right.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.244
A hundred percent.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.508
And I mean it.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.989
You lost two days' work
with nothing to show for it.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.730
I want to make it up to you.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.819
Taking the shift
myself tomorrow.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.995
Absolutely,great idea, sure.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.388
You don't trust me?

15:54.431 --> 15:55.867
No, I don't.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.087
Please, Gibbs!

15:58.131 --> 15:59.349
I don't know when this guy's
gonna come back,

15:59.393 --> 16:00.872
but when he does,
I'm gonna be here,

16:00.916 --> 16:03.658
and I swear to God,

16:03.701 --> 16:07.531
I will not make a move on
him until I talk to you.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.449
In the meantime...

16:12.493 --> 16:14.974
[laughs]:
you might want
to ice that shiner.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.585
Looks like I caught
you pretty good.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.762
Want to lay one on me?

16:20.805 --> 16:23.112
You'll feel better,
Butch, come on.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.855
Kid, the next time I say,

16:26.898 --> 16:28.639
"Let's go someplacelike Bolivia,"

16:28.683 --> 16:30.902
let's go someplacelike Bolivia.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.035
Yes!

16:33.079 --> 16:34.341
Attaboy, Butch,

16:34.384 --> 16:37.083
now we're backon the trail.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.302
Wait a minute.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.000
I was supposed
to be yourUncle Ed?

16:45.569 --> 16:47.919
[band warming up]

16:54.796 --> 16:56.972
Hey.Hey.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.930
BISHOP:
Hey, look, Gibbs is back.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.065
[whispering]:How's Emily?

17:03.109 --> 17:06.634
She's okay. For now.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.987
Your eye.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.249
What happened?

17:14.511 --> 17:16.731
[baton tapping]

17:18.472 --> 17:22.041
[indistinct chatter]

17:22.084 --> 17:25.000
So?So?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.916
You're still notgonna tell me.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.961
[chuckles]:
Tell you what?

17:32.138 --> 17:35.010
I guess Emily packs
quite a wallop, huh?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.490
Agent Gibbs, you have a second?

17:36.533 --> 17:39.101
Jack, there's fishing and
there's sturgeon fishing.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.885
Right. [scoffs]Sturgeon's a fighting fish.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.713
Of course.Of course.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.019
What, Palmer, what's up?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.414
Uh, uh, it, it's actually
kind of private.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.894
Oh. Sorry, okay,
have a good night.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.244
I'll call you later.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.117
I'm sorry, Agent Gibbs, uh,

17:55.161 --> 17:56.423
I just wanted
to tell you something

17:56.466 --> 17:57.424
before you heard itanywhere else.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.860
Hear what?

17:58.903 --> 18:00.340
Well, actually, you know,Kasie already knows.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.429
Are you surethat you don't know already?

18:02.472 --> 18:04.257
I just got here.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.085
Well, it's just that you havea way of knowing things

18:06.128 --> 18:08.913
before anyone else does,and so you... No?

18:08.957 --> 18:12.656
Okay, well, I-I just--I wanted you to know that, um,

18:12.700 --> 18:14.963
yeah, I might havemisplaced a body.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.399
Misplaced?

18:16.443 --> 18:18.358
Yeah, or-or it's,uh, it's missing?

18:18.401 --> 18:20.534
Missing how?

18:20.577 --> 18:22.971
I was just about to go meet
Agent Tyler back at NCIS.

18:23.014 --> 18:23.972
We're gonna figureit all out.

18:24.015 --> 18:25.408
I'll meet you there.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.976
No, Agent Gibbs, please,
we can handle this.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.847
I'll meet you there.Right.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.719
Like I told Agent Tyler,there's-there's got to be

18:31.762 --> 18:32.937
a perfectly logicalexplanation for all this.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.025
[car alarm chirps]

18:35.984 --> 18:37.377
[grunts]

18:37.420 --> 18:38.813
Palmer!

18:38.856 --> 18:41.076
[car alarms blaring]

18:52.653 --> 18:54.350
Jimmy, here you are.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.743
Gibbs.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.136
Tyler.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.572
Hey, are you okay?

18:58.615 --> 19:00.487
I'm just hearing about
your car. What is going on?

19:00.530 --> 19:02.663
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna miss
that old clunker.

19:02.706 --> 19:05.013
Although now I get to getthat minivan I've had my eye on.

19:05.056 --> 19:06.536
[chuckles]

19:06.580 --> 19:08.538
Yeah, clunker or not,
what was it?

19:08.582 --> 19:10.061
Are we talking a grenade or...?

19:10.105 --> 19:11.976
No, it was an IED.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.675
Kasie already ran a fragment
we found at the scene.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.198
Yeah, it's a basic device
any lunatic can pick up

19:16.242 --> 19:18.983
on the dark web,
attached to my door.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.550
Yeah, and fortunately
my remote set it off.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.422
Otherwise, I would be...

19:22.465 --> 19:24.511
Gosh, Jimmy, I am so sorry.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.165
No, no, I'm-I'm fine,
I'm fine, really.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.862
I don't even have a concussion.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.342
Besides, it's nothing you did.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.257
Unless there's a connection.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.215
I mean, could there be?

19:33.259 --> 19:35.696
First a body disappears,
and then Jimmy's car blows up?

19:35.739 --> 19:36.914
Don't you have
some famous rule

19:36.958 --> 19:38.873
about coincidences, Gibbs?

19:38.916 --> 19:41.919
No.
Who was the body?

19:42.920 --> 19:45.619
Marine CorporalRichard Darby.

19:45.662 --> 19:47.098
Fairfax PD called usto his home

19:47.142 --> 19:48.448
around 2:00 last night.

19:48.491 --> 19:51.494
Found in his driveway,
single gunshot to the chest.

19:51.538 --> 19:52.669
Witnesses?

19:52.713 --> 19:54.105
Lived alone,no next of kin.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.411
The neighbors heardthe shots,

19:55.455 --> 19:57.021
but they wereotherwise unhelpful.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.719
I logged in
Darby's body here

19:58.762 --> 20:00.503
at 5:32 a.m.

20:00.547 --> 20:01.852
JIMMY:
The body was absolutely here

20:01.896 --> 20:03.419
at 7:00 a.m.
when I got here,

20:03.463 --> 20:05.943
but by 3:00 in the afternoon,
it was gone.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.250
Now, as soon as Jimmy called, I
came back to check our cameras,

20:08.294 --> 20:10.339
only to find out that they'dbeen rebooted around noon

20:10.383 --> 20:13.168
by our security vendor to
fix some kind of glitch.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.822
System was off-line
for almost two hours.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.259
Yeah, well, one of thosetwo hours was my lunch break.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.565
Whoever stole the bodyknew that.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.567
Yeah, what could I
possibly have done

20:20.610 --> 20:22.351
to tick off that vendor?

20:22.395 --> 20:23.918
Nothing, Jimmy,
but I'm still gonna check

20:23.961 --> 20:25.702
the entire security staff,

20:25.746 --> 20:27.138
any custodial...Gonna check
more than that.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.836
Protective custody
for both of you.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.707
Well, I don't,
I don't need protection.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.622
It was your case, Ronnie.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.363
If they came after me,I mean,

20:34.407 --> 20:35.712
who's to say
they won't come after you, too?

20:35.756 --> 20:37.236
Your families, too.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.541
Yeah, Breena and Victoria,they're already

20:38.585 --> 20:40.761
at my in-laws' cabin
up at the Finger Lakes.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.893
Yeah, and my daughter's safe
at home with my mother-in-law.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.026
There'll be an agent
at both of your homes.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.509
In the meantime...

20:49.552 --> 20:50.901
you get some rest.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.773
Yeah, like that'll be possible.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.209
Oh, works for me.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.343
[groans] I am good right here.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.348
Hey, McGee.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.175
Morning.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.612
Give me an update.

21:05.655 --> 21:08.092
Uh, well, uh, just got
off the phone with the CO.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.877
Turns out that Corporal Darby

21:09.920 --> 21:12.009
put in for disability retirementtwo weeks ago.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.489
What kind of disability?

21:13.533 --> 21:14.969
Well, CO wouldn't
exactly use the term

21:15.012 --> 21:17.145
"PTSD," but she says
he hasn't been the same

21:17.188 --> 21:20.931
since his unit was ambushed
in Afghanistan two years ago.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.630
Corporal Darby lost two buddies.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.327
CO says, ever since then,
he's become

21:25.371 --> 21:26.937
increasingly antisocial
and angry.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.025
Any enemies?

21:28.069 --> 21:29.244
None that she knew of,

21:29.288 --> 21:30.332
but I'm just getting started
on that.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.421
Where is Bishopand where is Torres?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.554
Well, they are already
at Darby's house.

21:34.597 --> 21:37.731
Double-checking the crime scene
and Agent Tyler's witness list.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.080
And what about you, Gibbs?

21:40.516 --> 21:42.301
How was the fishing?

21:42.344 --> 21:44.215
Yeah, boss. You
catch any sturgeon?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.217
Nothing worth keeping.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.091
So that's it?

21:50.134 --> 21:52.485
Nothing more you care to sharewith me about your trip?

21:52.528 --> 21:53.747
No.

21:53.790 --> 21:54.878
Not yet, Leon, no.

21:54.922 --> 21:56.880
What about Dr. Palmer?

21:56.924 --> 21:59.448
I spoke with Agent Tyler after
you assigned them protection.

21:59.492 --> 22:00.710
That was a good call.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.974
Palmer's fine.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.236
Tyler's, uh, sleeping.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.237
In Kasie's office.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.674
Good.

22:07.717 --> 22:08.979
You know she's family.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.764
Yeah. You and
her husband.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.635
Latehusband.

22:12.679 --> 22:13.767
Darryl.

22:13.810 --> 22:14.898
My godson.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.511
He was killed in Iraq last year.

22:18.554 --> 22:22.210
Tyler's been an ace
on the night crew, Leon.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.473
Sent an agent
to watch her family.

22:24.517 --> 22:25.300
Send another.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.868
Keep me posted.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.304
Hey.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.088
She's good.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.134
You could move her to days.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.397
Like I said, Gibbs,
she's family.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.401
I'm only gonna takenepotism so far.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.841
Darby sure lived
a pretty minimal existence.

22:44.885 --> 22:47.278
Not much to speak of inthe way of furniture or clothes.

22:47.322 --> 22:48.932
Yeah, the same with his camper.

22:48.976 --> 22:50.804
Canned food.Bottled water.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.806
Not much else.Hmm.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.547
All right, well,
let's see what we've got

22:54.590 --> 22:56.723
on Tyler's witness list.

22:56.766 --> 22:59.508
Yeah, maybe one of them can tellus where Gibbs disappeared to.

22:59.552 --> 23:00.988
Oh, my God, would
you stop already?

23:01.031 --> 23:02.381
"Where'd Gibbs go?"
"Why'd he come back?"

23:02.424 --> 23:03.817
The man's making us all crazy.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.341
I know, I know. Okay.We'll talk about something else.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.343
Let's talk aboutJimmy's hot new car.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.345
His old car isn't
even cold yet.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.261
I know, but the dude wants,like, a... a dadmobile.

23:13.304 --> 23:15.045
I mean, this issuch a rare opportunity.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.743
Either get a badass caror go home.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.962
You call someone
blowing up Jimmy's car

23:19.006 --> 23:20.834
"a rare opportunity"?

23:20.877 --> 23:22.009
For Jimmy to be cool?

23:22.052 --> 23:23.140
Uh, yeah.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.751
Excuse me.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.492
Do you know
if they caught the guy?TORRES: Not yet.

23:26.535 --> 23:27.884
We're working on it.

23:27.928 --> 23:29.059
BISHOP: Let's see, next doorneighbor... you would be

23:29.103 --> 23:31.410
Karl... is it "Chunk"?Karl Chunk, yes.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.454
Yeah, I spoke
to that nice agent,

23:32.498 --> 23:33.716
uh, the night it happened.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.414
Yeah, I've got your
statement right here.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.850
Poor Darby.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.721
He kept to himself, but he was
a really great neighbor.

23:38.765 --> 23:39.983
[dog growls]Baloney.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.855
Respect for the dead, Gila.

23:41.898 --> 23:45.162
Darby was a grade-A weirdo,
Chunk, and you know it.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.035
Which would make you Gila Shaw.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.993
That guy was always puttering
around his camper,

23:50.037 --> 23:51.952
muttering about
the end of the world.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.867
Puttering and muttering.
Got it right here.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.696
For the record, I never heard
him mutter anything like that.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.480
[dog barking]Who the hell asked you, Chunk?

23:58.524 --> 24:01.527
Come on, people.Inside voice. Geez.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.745
BISHOP: All right.Well, what we could use

24:02.789 --> 24:04.007
is anything you guys remember,maybe forgot

24:04.051 --> 24:05.618
to tell Agent Tyler?

24:05.661 --> 24:07.271
Don't you think we would've
called if there was?

24:07.315 --> 24:08.838
That's why she gave us her card,isn't it?

24:09.752 --> 24:11.232
Nothing new here.

24:11.275 --> 24:12.276
I heard a gunshot
around midnight

24:12.320 --> 24:13.539
and then a car speeding away.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.541
I sure didn't
hear any car.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.499
And it was more like 12:30.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.109
I live right next door here,
Gila.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.676
You live two houses down.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.505
And I still hear
better than you, Chunk.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.159
Come on,
Sunshine.

24:26.943 --> 24:28.684
Tyler was not kidding.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.294
[sighs]

24:30.338 --> 24:32.209
"Neighbors are decidedly
unhelpful."

24:33.602 --> 24:35.517
[phone rings]

24:35.561 --> 24:36.866
FORNELL:
Gibbs.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.259
Hey, Tobias, what?

24:38.302 --> 24:39.826
How's your day going, Butch?

24:39.869 --> 24:40.957
Not bad.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.045
I'm busy. What about you?

24:42.089 --> 24:43.307
Just got to the clinic.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.309
Winston hasn't shown up yet,

24:45.353 --> 24:46.876
but I'll call you
as soon as he gets here.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.313
Listen, doesn't look like
I'm gonna be able to join you.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.620
No problem. I can handle it.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.839
[chuckling]:
You sure about that?

24:52.882 --> 24:54.275
I insist.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.886
My emotions are
completely in check, Gibbs,

24:56.930 --> 24:58.497
and I'm sticking to the plan.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.977
Okay.
So when our guy shows up...

25:01.021 --> 25:02.675
I just track his moves.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.546
We'll pull the trigger
as soon as you're free.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.852
No, no, no, no, no.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.157
There's no trigger-pulling.

25:07.201 --> 25:09.159
It's a metaphor, Butch.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.160
Lighten up.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.423
Listen, you lighten up, okay?

25:12.467 --> 25:15.252
You keep your head in
the game, Tobias. You...

25:16.427 --> 25:17.385
So...?

25:17.428 --> 25:18.386
You know what?

25:18.429 --> 25:19.822
Don't even ask.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.695
Whoa.Not even "How's Jimmy?"

25:22.738 --> 25:23.913
You're not the only one

25:23.957 --> 25:25.045
having a rough couple of days,
you know.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.569
Yeah, I know.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.266
Why do you thinkI've had a rough couple of days?

25:29.310 --> 25:31.094
Look, if you want to tell me

25:31.138 --> 25:33.270
what you and Fornell are up to,
you will.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.576
Right?

25:34.620 --> 25:36.447
Meantime, my main concern

25:36.491 --> 25:38.319
is finding out
who blew up Jimmy's car

25:38.362 --> 25:40.495
and stole Agent Tyler's victim.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.105
Seriously,
how does that even happen?

25:42.149 --> 25:43.324
Boss.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.543
What, McGee?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.153
It's about Agent Tyler.

25:46.196 --> 25:47.850
Yeah? What?I was just about

25:47.894 --> 25:50.549
to send over that additionalagent to help guard her house.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.855
Turns out that Tyler sent
that first agent home.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.988
She did what?

25:55.031 --> 25:56.250
Is Agent Tyler up here?

25:56.293 --> 25:58.905
She's not with you?

25:58.948 --> 26:00.689
She was half asleep
in one of my comfy chairs

26:00.733 --> 26:02.125
till she got
a phone call and

26:02.169 --> 26:03.823
ran out without a word.

26:07.174 --> 26:08.958
WOMAN:You have to tell them, Ronnie.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.830
Mom, I cannot tell anyone.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.309
Hey, and neither can you.
Don't you get that?

26:12.353 --> 26:13.789
I have to do this alone.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.095
GIBBS:
Do what?

26:15.138 --> 26:17.097
What's going on, Tyler?

26:17.140 --> 26:19.795
Gibbs, it's nothing.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.754
I just had to go home to...

26:26.106 --> 26:27.760
I'm sorry, Gibbs, I had to.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.198
Or he's gonna kill
my little girl.

26:34.984 --> 26:36.638
[latch clicks]

26:42.688 --> 26:44.559
BISHOP:That's Corporal Darby.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.474
TORRES:Jimmy's missing body.

26:48.824 --> 26:51.218
I dropped off Darby's bodyat the end of my shift,

26:51.261 --> 26:53.176
planning to go and
finish the case the next day,

26:53.220 --> 26:57.050
only to get home and find
a masked man in my living room.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.312
He climbed throughmy bedroom window

26:58.355 --> 26:59.618
like a demonin the night.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.184
Medium height and build,

27:01.228 --> 27:02.751
he had a slight accent
of some kind,

27:02.795 --> 27:04.013
but he had...

27:06.712 --> 27:08.670
He had a gun on my Jasmine.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.763
He told me ifI ever wanted to see her again,

27:14.807 --> 27:16.722
that I need to get
Darby's body back,

27:16.765 --> 27:18.898
along with any evidence
that might point back to him.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.464
How'd he find your place?

27:20.508 --> 27:22.379
We have been racking
our brain about this.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.164
How does he know us?
Do we know him?

27:24.207 --> 27:25.339
Was it some kind of setup?

27:25.382 --> 27:26.427
And why Jimmy?

27:28.255 --> 27:30.605
I think that was my fault.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.173
I was tryingto reason with the guy.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.827
Told him it was too late.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.132
That our M.E.
already examined the body.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.351
Uh, what was it he said?

27:37.394 --> 27:39.614
"Let me worry about the M.E."

27:39.658 --> 27:42.661
Look, I never meant
to put Jimmy in any danger.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.925
You killed the camera
and took the body.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.143
It's crazy.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.145
I know.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.321
But right now,

27:51.365 --> 27:53.367
I will do anythingto get my baby back.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.804
And how do we get her back?

27:55.848 --> 27:57.937
So, the guy called at noon,
like he said he would.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.852
Told me to make the dropin Franconia,

27:59.895 --> 28:02.506
3:00 p.m.,
a trash can in Memorial Park.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.683
Drop a whole body
in a trash can?

28:04.726 --> 28:05.988
No.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.598
Just the right hand.

28:22.831 --> 28:26.487
This was bound fora nursing school in Ohio,

28:26.530 --> 28:28.924
but they'll justhave to wait.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.317
I swear, Jimmy,

28:30.360 --> 28:32.275
if you'd been in your car...

28:32.319 --> 28:34.147
I'd never forgive myself.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.496
I wasn't, all right?

28:35.539 --> 28:36.889
So you won't have to.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.806
There's nothingto apologize for.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.069
I'm good.

28:44.505 --> 28:47.073
Hey, what if this guy realizesthat's not Darby's hand?

28:47.116 --> 28:48.552
It won't matter.

28:48.596 --> 28:49.815
He will be in custody by then.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.426
And you'll haveyour daughter back.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.341
From your mouth to God's ears.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.472
Are you kidding me?

28:55.516 --> 28:57.561
With Agent Torreson the case?

28:57.605 --> 28:59.520
It's a guarantee. [chuckles]

28:59.563 --> 29:00.782
TORRES:Jimmy...

29:00.826 --> 29:02.828
you got to hurry up
with that hand.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.364
Nothing pointsto our killer yet, boss,

29:17.407 --> 29:19.670
but I did discover a few odd
details about Corporal Darby.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.237
How odd?Well, his
therapist says

29:21.281 --> 29:22.935
that over the past year,

29:22.978 --> 29:25.459
Darby has gone from being
a confident, optimistic Marine

29:25.502 --> 29:27.504
to a sleep-deprived paranoiac

29:27.548 --> 29:29.811
who's planning for some
kind of cataclysmic event.

29:29.855 --> 29:30.943
What, end of the world
kind of stuff?

29:30.986 --> 29:32.814
Doomsday prepper,
which would explain

29:32.858 --> 29:34.816
the camper in his backyard

29:34.860 --> 29:36.035
packed with bottled waterand canned goods.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.427
What else?

29:37.471 --> 29:38.820
His bank accounts.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.517
Darby closed 'em last week.

29:40.561 --> 29:44.217
Took out his entire life
savings in cash: $106,000.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.089
Wow, that is an amount
worth killing for.

29:49.613 --> 29:51.485
For a killer.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.139
[phone rings]Hmm.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.836
You ready, Nick?

29:54.880 --> 29:56.795
Yeah.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.492
I'll meet you out front.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.380
One more minute. Stand by.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.034
Why wait, Gibbs?

30:19.078 --> 30:20.470
I should just go now.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.863
He said 3:00.

30:21.907 --> 30:22.864
We go at 3:00.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.387
You make the drop,

30:24.431 --> 30:26.259
you keep moving.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.913
Let Torres do the rest.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.132
Though don't expect me
to keep moving too far.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.482
Tyler, are you sure
you're up to this?

30:32.526 --> 30:34.310
If it was your daughter,
wouldn't you be?

30:34.354 --> 30:36.965
[phone ringing]

Dogan escaped
