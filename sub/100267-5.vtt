WEBVTT

00:13.347 --> 00:16.184
You had to use
the facilities the other day.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.522
Oh, fucking Alexander.

00:20.555 --> 00:22.356
Mmm‐hmm. This is
where the dicks hang out.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.792
Oh, that's right.
Gail had told me

00:23.825 --> 00:25.527
you're helping with
clean up here now, eh?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.729
(CHUCKLES) Shake more than once
and we know what you're doing.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.063
How long you been at it?

00:29.097 --> 00:30.699
48 fiscal hours.

00:30.732 --> 00:33.702
More than enough time to see
a nightmare or two in here, eh.

00:33.735 --> 00:35.336
Sometimes there's shit,

00:35.369 --> 00:37.105
on the outside
of the torlet.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.242
‐Huh?
‐Sometimes there's shit,

00:41.275 --> 00:42.677
on the outside
of the torlet.

00:42.711 --> 00:44.513
Huh. Is that right?

00:44.546 --> 00:46.615
If you think that's bad,
you should see the uriness.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.718
‐Huh?
‐If you think that's bad,

00:49.751 --> 00:51.152
you should see the uriness.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.486
They get pretty
hairy over there?

00:52.521 --> 00:53.822
Sometimes there's shit,

00:53.855 --> 00:55.489
on the outside
of the uriness.

00:55.524 --> 00:57.626
‐What?
‐Sometimes there's shit,

00:57.659 --> 00:59.460
on the outside
of the uriness.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.129
Fuck a duck.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.330
Well, how do you think
it got there?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.398
Remember how I said,
sometimes there's shit

01:04.432 --> 01:05.800
on the outside
of the torlet?

01:05.834 --> 01:07.636
‐Yeah.
‐Well, I'll bet the shit

01:07.669 --> 01:09.303
got on the outside
of the uriness,

01:09.337 --> 01:11.172
the same way the shit
got on the outside

01:11.205 --> 01:12.807
‐of the torlet.
‐Didn't that sound...

01:13.875 --> 01:15.644
This piss
is now streaming.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.313
‐Wayne?
‐No.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.449
How are you now?
Not so bad.
Good, and you?

01:21.482 --> 01:24.553
‐Alexander.
‐Out there, you're Canadian.

01:24.586 --> 01:26.855
In here... European.

01:26.888 --> 01:28.723
Oh, shit.

01:28.757 --> 01:30.692
Looks like someone
unswallowed over there.

01:30.725 --> 01:31.860
Hmm. If you think
that's bad,

01:31.893 --> 01:35.229
sometimes there's shit,
on the outside of the torlet.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.397
‐Huh?
‐If you think that's bad,

01:36.430 --> 01:39.267
sometimes there's shit,
on the outside of the torlet.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.602
I spray the seat
from time to time

01:40.635 --> 01:42.236
when I've got
crap on tap,

01:42.270 --> 01:43.872
but I never miss
the bowl entirely.

01:43.905 --> 01:45.807
Fuckin degens
need to mind their scruples.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.676
If you think that's bad,
you should see the uriness.

01:47.709 --> 01:49.110
‐Huh?
‐You think that's bad,

01:49.143 --> 01:50.311
you should see the uriness.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.746
Hmm. Pretty hairy over there?

01:51.780 --> 01:54.182
Sometimes there's shit,
on the outside of the uriness.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.750
‐What?
‐Sometimes there's shit,

01:55.784 --> 01:57.485
on the outside
of the uriness.

01:57.519 --> 01:58.753
How the fuck
did shit get there?

01:58.787 --> 02:00.689
Remember when I said,
sometimes there's shit

02:00.722 --> 02:02.290
on the outside of the torlet?

02:02.323 --> 02:04.192
Feels like you told me that
nearly a year ago now.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.727
Though we're kind of burning
daylight here, eh?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.195
‐Mmm‐hmm.
‐I bet the shit

02:07.228 --> 02:08.730
got on the outside
of the uriness,

02:08.763 --> 02:10.464
the same way the shit
got on the outside

02:10.498 --> 02:13.201
‐of the torlet.
‐Uh‐oh.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.402
No offense or nothing,
but I think

02:14.435 --> 02:16.270
I rather just
piss outside, Alexander.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.372
I just came in
to wash my hands.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.440
Why are you washing
your hands?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.909
‐Had a dart.
‐Hm.

02:20.942 --> 02:22.376
Well, I'd have
a dart.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.778
Maybe I'd have
a dart with you

02:23.812 --> 02:25.580
and then wash my hands
after that dart.

02:25.614 --> 02:26.615
Hey gents.

02:27.816 --> 02:29.417
I know how the shit
got on the outside

02:29.450 --> 02:31.620
of the torlet
and also the uriness,

02:31.653 --> 02:33.755
but why would someone

02:33.788 --> 02:35.924
take a shit on the outside
of the torlet

02:35.957 --> 02:37.325
and also the uriness?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.297
'Cause that's where
the dicks hang out.

02:43.965 --> 02:46.167
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:54.609 --> 02:55.677
‐Wayne.
‐Katy.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.646
What are you
up to today?

02:57.679 --> 02:59.213
‐What abouts?
‐This aft.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.381
What, like this
afternoon‐ish?

03:00.414 --> 03:01.449
This afternoon‐ish, yeah.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.951
Well, I'd have
to check my agenda.

03:02.984 --> 03:04.619
‐You check your log?
‐Check your records?

03:04.653 --> 03:05.920
Well, I checked
your day planner

03:05.954 --> 03:08.456
and your logged line
underlined it in bold

03:08.489 --> 03:10.224
and highlighted
in italics.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.292
Oh?

03:11.325 --> 03:12.661
Anything, uh,
ringing a bell?

03:12.694 --> 03:14.228
‐Striking a cord?
‐Drumming on up?

03:14.262 --> 03:15.764
Oh, that's right.

03:15.797 --> 03:18.199
ALL: Yard sale Saturday!

03:18.232 --> 03:19.668
Super fucking shooters.

03:19.701 --> 03:20.735
You boys
ready to dicker?

03:20.769 --> 03:21.836
Well, you always
gotta dicker.

03:21.870 --> 03:23.605
Heard McMurray's got
a real good spread this year.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.406
‐How big a spread?
‐Like good size spread.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.808
What, like
two‐three table spread?

03:26.841 --> 03:27.876
No, like three‐five
table spread.

03:27.909 --> 03:29.243
A three to five tabler!

03:29.277 --> 03:30.779
Gail's tabling
all of her old glassware

03:30.812 --> 03:31.913
so I'll get a set or two.

03:31.946 --> 03:32.981
Well, Katy, you better
make sure you got

03:33.014 --> 03:34.348
fucking room for another set.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.917
There's plenty of room
for another set.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.786
Katy, there's such a thing
as too much sets,

03:37.819 --> 03:39.287
a gal oughta be
fucking aware of it.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.555
Dan, you still gonna be
after old books?

03:40.589 --> 03:42.924
Well, same as you is gonna be
on the hunt for old pornos Dary.

03:42.957 --> 03:45.760
Yeah, I bet the McMurray's got
a good spread on their spread.

03:45.794 --> 03:46.995
And there'll be lots of
old tins

03:47.028 --> 03:48.663
and signage for you,
big brother.

03:48.697 --> 03:50.498
Good buddy, how that
get to be your niche?

03:50.532 --> 03:51.700
Old signs and tins?

03:51.733 --> 03:53.334
Well, it's the history
of it I like.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.569
It's the history, you see.

03:54.603 --> 03:56.370
Where it started,
why it started,

03:56.404 --> 03:57.506
where it's been.

03:57.539 --> 03:59.440
Professor Tricia says,
lots of those old corporations

03:59.473 --> 04:01.442
were run by racists and that
they should just be left

04:01.475 --> 04:03.277
in the waste paper basket
where they belong.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.646
Well, I should tell
Professor Tricia

04:04.679 --> 04:06.314
if you don't understand
where you came from,

04:06.347 --> 04:07.749
you never understand
where you are.

04:07.782 --> 04:09.483
‐Bak‐set.
‐Attaboy.

04:09.518 --> 04:10.919
Well, make sure
she dickers.

04:10.952 --> 04:12.020
Well, you always
gotta dicker.

04:12.053 --> 04:14.255
Wayne, why don't you tell us
the Canadian Pickers'

04:14.288 --> 04:15.323
guide to dickering?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.891
You mean
the greatest Canadian

04:16.925 --> 04:18.693
feelgood show
of all time,

04:18.727 --> 04:20.562
‐Canadian Pickers?
‐Yep.

04:20.595 --> 04:22.296
‐Step one.
‐Identify item

04:22.330 --> 04:23.598
and recite
some history on it

04:23.632 --> 04:25.834
to establish genuine interest
in the said item.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.537
‐Step two.
‐Ask the seller,

04:28.570 --> 04:30.639
what are you gonna need
to have out of that?

04:30.672 --> 04:32.006
‐Step three.
‐No matter what price

04:32.040 --> 04:33.975
the seller gives you,
tell the seller,

04:34.008 --> 04:35.944
"Well, that sounds like
retail to me."

04:35.977 --> 04:37.011
KATY: Step four.

04:37.045 --> 04:38.613
Circle back on step two

04:38.647 --> 04:40.281
and ask the seller,

04:40.314 --> 04:42.951
"What's the absolute best
you can do on it?"

04:42.984 --> 04:44.018
And step five?

04:44.052 --> 04:45.787
If the seller holds firm,

04:45.820 --> 04:46.788
bundle item of interest in

04:46.821 --> 04:48.890
with a few other items
to get the price down

04:48.923 --> 04:50.725
to one you're
comfortable paying.

04:50.759 --> 04:52.493
‐Bob's your uncle.
‐Masterful.

04:52.527 --> 04:53.795
That's how
you fucking dicker.

04:53.828 --> 04:54.929
Well, you always
gotta dicker.

04:56.798 --> 04:58.399
Are one of youse
wearing perfume?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.301
Men aren't supposed
to wear perfume, Katy.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.703
She might means cologne,
good buddies.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.972
Could be eau de toilette
'cause that's unisex.

05:04.005 --> 05:05.774
Oh, what fucking isn't
these days?

05:05.807 --> 05:07.909
Sounds like someone's
going on a date.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.477
Well, it's not a date.
It's a...

05:10.912 --> 05:11.946
go along.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.314
Sounds like
a date to me.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.549
No, it's not a date.
It's a...

05:16.050 --> 05:17.318
walkabout.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.687
Rosie came calling.

05:18.720 --> 05:19.821
Is it racist to say that

05:19.854 --> 05:21.923
I think Rosie looks a whole
lot like Princess Jasmine?

05:21.956 --> 05:23.457
No, we're just gonna
take the dogs

05:23.491 --> 05:24.626
for a run there, so.

05:24.659 --> 05:25.760
Hmm. Doggy date.

05:25.794 --> 05:27.996
Sounds like a pretty choice
afternoon, big brother.

05:28.029 --> 05:29.363
Some say the choicest.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.732
Well, I'm gonna
bring Dierks.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.433
So, see if Rosie
wants to come too.

05:33.935 --> 05:35.937
(GRUMBLING)

05:40.542 --> 05:42.611
Couple of five‐elevens,
if I've ever seen 'em.

05:42.644 --> 05:44.445
‐Huh?
‐You're fucking average.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.715
Do you think
Bush did 5/11?

05:46.748 --> 05:48.449
Update.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.619
Uh, we couldn't exactly...

05:50.652 --> 05:51.920
get the club
off the ground.

05:51.953 --> 05:53.454
You're kidding.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.556
Told ya. Pay up.

05:56.157 --> 05:58.426
That's strike one.
Moving on.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.128
BROdude has suggested
we lend you

06:00.161 --> 06:01.663
resources for
a photoshoot.

06:01.696 --> 06:03.598
See if we can't get you
looking a little less

06:03.632 --> 06:04.733
herrrr.

06:04.766 --> 06:06.635
‐Sick!
‐I shot down that suggestion.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.069
‐Gutty.
‐And suggested

06:08.102 --> 06:10.404
that any resources
lent to Derek Zoolander

06:10.438 --> 06:12.541
and Hansel would be
misused resources.

06:12.574 --> 06:14.142
So, you're going
to do it yourselves.

06:14.175 --> 06:15.544
Be models?

06:16.678 --> 06:17.879
A photoshoot.

06:17.912 --> 06:19.413
‐Huh.
‐Find a photographer

06:19.447 --> 06:20.481
and have them
shoot you the way

06:20.515 --> 06:21.683
you would like
to be portrayed

06:21.716 --> 06:23.051
as BROdude
brand ambassadors.

06:23.084 --> 06:24.686
Get a girl or two
like this on board

06:24.719 --> 06:26.688
to check
the representation box,

06:26.721 --> 06:28.723
strip 'em down
like this,

06:28.757 --> 06:30.825
and send to me
when complete. Kapiche?

06:30.859 --> 06:32.794
Isn't it kinda not PC

06:32.827 --> 06:35.496
to include a girl
but then sexualize them?

06:35.530 --> 06:36.831
Pull out
your fucking tampon.

06:36.865 --> 06:38.800
Could we...
could we use those girls?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.769
Remember what
I just said

06:40.802 --> 06:42.136
about misused resources?

06:44.606 --> 06:46.140
‐Yes.
‐And neither one of these girls

06:46.174 --> 06:48.577
would cross the street to piss
on you if you were on fire.

06:48.610 --> 06:49.611
Would you?

06:54.482 --> 06:55.483
You've let me down today.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.787
I'm gonna have to take
a number on both of you.

07:00.221 --> 07:01.823
What's the opposite of "he?"

07:01.856 --> 07:03.592
BOTH: Herrr?

07:03.625 --> 07:06.427
You're fucking right
it is. 24 hours.

07:08.563 --> 07:09.731
Okay, bro.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.432
We're gonna need
a mega babe.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.466
Hmm.

07:13.935 --> 07:15.036
Daryl's ex‐sweetie!

07:15.069 --> 07:17.471
(BOTH CHEERING)

07:17.506 --> 07:19.440
Is it racist to say that
I think that

07:19.473 --> 07:21.810
Daryl's ex‐sweetie
looks like Princess Jasmine?

07:24.779 --> 07:26.080
ALY: Stewart.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.982
‐Aly.
‐Stewart.

07:28.983 --> 07:30.018
Bianca‐donk.

07:30.051 --> 07:31.586
‐Stewart.
‐Roald.

07:31.620 --> 07:32.887
Know that quote
from Spider‐Man,

07:32.921 --> 07:34.989
with great risk
comes great reward?

07:35.023 --> 07:36.891
Actually, it's with
great power comes...

07:36.925 --> 07:37.959
She's paraphrasing.

07:37.992 --> 07:39.661
We're back
in business, baby.

07:39.694 --> 07:41.095
‐C‐Nicholadas.
‐G‐Nicoladas.

07:41.129 --> 07:43.164
Actually, it's GHB‐Nicoladas.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.633
She's abbreviating.

07:44.666 --> 07:46.601
We're going back
to the city, but

07:46.635 --> 07:47.669
before we do,

07:47.702 --> 07:49.103
Let's talk about
the great reward

07:49.137 --> 07:51.039
that follows
your great risk.

07:53.074 --> 07:54.709
ROALD: And that quote
is actually

07:54.743 --> 07:56.978
by Uncle Ben as well,
not Spider‐Man.

07:57.011 --> 07:59.047
She's ballparking, Roald!

08:02.083 --> 08:04.686
For clarification,
we're talking about...

08:04.719 --> 08:05.887
Some of that good fucking.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.756
‐Mmm. Mm‐hmm.
‐Mmm. Mm‐hmm.

08:11.826 --> 08:13.762
Wonderous.

08:17.198 --> 08:18.199
Keys.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.135
‐You seen Rosie yet?
‐No.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.604
We've got two hours
to run the dogs

08:22.637 --> 08:24.706
before I'm back with Dierks.
So, pitter‐patter.

08:24.739 --> 08:25.740
Okay.

08:26.808 --> 08:28.643
Must've been
kind of weird.

08:28.677 --> 08:30.779
First impression meeting
Dierks at the rippers, eh?

08:30.812 --> 08:32.914
Well, a first impression's
a lasting one.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.116
Proceeding with caution.

08:35.149 --> 08:36.918
You're a big girl.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.120
Buck and a half, we're
tabling yard sales, 10‐4?

08:39.153 --> 08:40.254
ALL: Over and out.

08:44.893 --> 08:47.195
‐Wayned.
‐Dan.

08:47.228 --> 08:48.963
Must be kind of weird
first impression

08:48.997 --> 08:50.999
meeting Katy's new sweetie
at the rippers there, eh?

08:51.032 --> 08:52.934
A first impression's
a lasting one.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.669
Well, she said
she'll proceed with caution.

08:54.703 --> 08:55.870
Well, she's a big girl.

08:55.904 --> 08:57.305
You don't much care
for him, does youse?

08:57.338 --> 08:59.574
No, you shouldn't air
your dirty laundry.

08:59.608 --> 09:01.075
‐Good guy?
‐Who, Dierks?

09:01.109 --> 09:02.143
He's a pretty good guy.

09:02.176 --> 09:04.012
Oh, he's a great
guy then. Dierks.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.146
‐Why do you say it like that?
‐Huh?

09:05.179 --> 09:07.215
‐His name.
‐Who, Dierks?

09:07.248 --> 09:08.082
‐Yeah.
‐Well, I make him say

09:08.116 --> 09:10.284
‐Dierks anyway.
‐Oh, sures he does.

09:11.185 --> 09:12.186
Say my name.

09:13.655 --> 09:14.823
‐Dary.
‐Now his.

09:16.658 --> 09:17.491
Dan.

09:17.526 --> 09:19.794
And what's Katie's
new sweetie's name?

09:19.828 --> 09:21.863
‐(LOUDLY) Dierks.
‐Yeah. Now I hear it.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.131
You says it
a certain way.

09:23.164 --> 09:24.633
You hammered really hard
on the "D."

09:24.666 --> 09:25.667
(LOUDLY) Did I?

09:26.701 --> 09:28.302
(GULPING)

09:30.038 --> 09:31.239
REILLY: You know how
Daryl's ex‐sweetie

09:31.272 --> 09:33.241
has a super
racy Instagram?

09:33.274 --> 09:34.843
JONESY: I can't stop
loving you!

09:34.876 --> 09:36.911
Well, I slid into
her DMs and I was like,

09:36.945 --> 09:38.913
"Hey, know how you're
an Instagram model?

09:38.947 --> 09:40.649
"Well, how would
you like to be a..."

09:40.682 --> 09:42.050
I don't even know
what the fuck they're called.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.251
‐A real model?
‐See, that's what

09:43.284 --> 09:45.219
I ended up going with,
like a real model,

09:45.253 --> 09:47.689
‐how would you like to be...
‐A real model, like,

09:47.722 --> 09:49.858
someone who is actually
a real model.

09:49.891 --> 09:51.125
Yeah, like, an actual,
real model.

09:51.159 --> 09:53.194
So, I said, "How would you like
to be an actual, real model?

09:53.227 --> 09:54.629
‐Mmm‐hmm.
‐"for BROdude energy?"

09:54.663 --> 09:55.864
And what did she say?

09:55.897 --> 09:56.965
Something in French.

09:56.998 --> 09:58.633
Well, the only French
I know is like... <i>zut!</i>

09:58.667 --> 10:00.101
Yeah, me too.
Like, zut alors!

10:00.134 --> 10:01.202
‐And what did you say?
‐Well,

10:01.235 --> 10:02.604
I gave her
my email address

10:02.637 --> 10:04.372
because my email has
a translation option.

10:04.405 --> 10:06.775
‐Did she email you back then?
‐She emailed me back, bro.

10:06.808 --> 10:07.776
What did it
translate to, buddy?

10:07.809 --> 10:10.211
This message required
no translation, buddy.

10:11.012 --> 10:12.013
Whoa.

10:12.781 --> 10:14.282
Zut.

10:14.315 --> 10:15.850
Zut alors.

10:15.884 --> 10:18.753
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

10:18.787 --> 10:19.788
(BOTH WHOOP)

10:20.889 --> 10:23.124
Honey, you sure?

10:23.157 --> 10:24.959
Well, look at this tall
drink of Canadian Lager

10:24.993 --> 10:26.160
lumbering over.

10:26.194 --> 10:28.129
Lumber Lager is
a choice name for a beer.

10:28.162 --> 10:29.798
Oh well, Katy got
a wee bit held up

10:29.831 --> 10:31.933
at the border there, so thought
we'd just shlep'er over.

10:31.966 --> 10:33.301
‐Shlep'er?
‐Hardly knew her.

10:33.334 --> 10:34.869
Well, if no one's driving
how'd youse like

10:34.903 --> 10:36.137
to get into one
of these cocksuckers?

10:36.170 --> 10:37.639
No time like the present
Ms. Mac.

10:37.672 --> 10:38.940
‐Mmm.
‐Oh, Wayne,

10:39.340 --> 10:41.242
mind if I...

10:41.275 --> 10:43.077
take your date
deep inside?

10:45.714 --> 10:46.881
Go inside the house
with your date.

10:46.915 --> 10:48.650
‐Oh, we're not on a...
‐We're not on a...

10:50.418 --> 10:51.720
Okay.

10:53.955 --> 10:55.123
See, remember
I was telling you

10:55.156 --> 10:56.658
McMurray's got
a three to five tabler?

10:56.691 --> 10:58.292
Hells of a spreads
you gots here, McMurrays.

10:58.326 --> 10:59.661
It's a two knuckler table'n.

10:59.694 --> 11:01.696
‐Oh, it's a good spread.
‐As advertised.

11:01.730 --> 11:02.831
Well, it's a great spread.

11:02.864 --> 11:03.932
What were you expecting?

11:03.965 --> 11:05.900
‐Honestly,
‐Shall we be honest?

11:05.934 --> 11:07.769
I thought I was coming
over here to see

11:07.802 --> 11:08.970
two‐three banquet tables

11:09.003 --> 11:10.171
with a card table
on each end.

11:10.204 --> 11:11.339
Oh, no sir.

11:11.372 --> 11:13.775
But now I come over here
and I see five banquet tables

11:13.808 --> 11:15.076
with a card table
on each end.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.945
Once you become
predictable, Wayne,

11:16.978 --> 11:17.879
you become beatable.

11:17.912 --> 11:19.347
What are you tabling
this year, McMurray?

11:19.380 --> 11:20.849
Oh, no. Look
with your eyes,

11:20.882 --> 11:22.016
not with
your hands, Dary.

11:22.050 --> 11:24.218
Now, would you just
look at that?

11:25.019 --> 11:26.354
Top Tobacco Canada.

11:26.387 --> 11:28.222
Now, that is
a beautiful piece.

11:28.256 --> 11:29.924
Ain't that
a beautiful piece?

11:29.958 --> 11:30.992
Pertnear mint too.

11:31.025 --> 11:32.460
Oh, I can see
she's pertnear mint,

11:32.493 --> 11:33.427
But unfortunately for you,

11:33.461 --> 11:35.764
pertnear's only good
in horse shoes and...

11:35.797 --> 11:36.831
‐Long darts.
‐Yep.

11:36.865 --> 11:40.168
Top Tobacco Canada,
founded in the early 1900s.

11:40.201 --> 11:42.904
One of Canada's first
distributor of tobacco.

11:42.937 --> 11:43.905
Bet you didn't know that.

11:43.938 --> 11:46.107
Oh, I am impressed
with your knowledge, Wayne.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.141
‐McMurray...
‐Mmm?

11:48.743 --> 11:50.879
What are you gonna need
to have outta that?

11:50.912 --> 11:53.715
Oh, that's a $50 bill any day
of the week, Chief.

11:53.748 --> 11:55.750
See, now that sounds
like retail to me.

11:55.784 --> 11:56.851
Look here, Chief.
You said yourself

11:56.885 --> 11:58.853
it's a beautiful piece.
Given the condition of it,

11:58.887 --> 12:00.889
and the historical value
attached to it.

12:00.922 --> 12:02.256
‐$50 you say?
‐Mmm‐hmm.

12:02.290 --> 12:03.692
‐McMurray...
‐Mmm?

12:05.026 --> 12:08.162
What's the absolute best
you can do on it?

12:08.196 --> 12:09.898
Well, being an avid
collector myself,

12:09.931 --> 12:10.765
Wayne, I can't see myself

12:10.799 --> 12:12.466
parting it with any less
than a $50 note.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.568
Why don't we just...

12:13.602 --> 12:15.236
Why don't you bundle
a few items together, Big Dad?

12:17.205 --> 12:19.140
‐Ol' long dick Dierks!
‐Pardon?

12:19.173 --> 12:21.442
Long dicker Dierks today,
tight shirt, huge pecs.

12:21.475 --> 12:22.511
Just see if you can get
the price down

12:22.544 --> 12:24.846
just a wee bit for 'em there
boo‐boo kitty fuck.

12:24.879 --> 12:27.749
Let's keep this thing civil.
Very civil. Very square.

12:27.782 --> 12:29.818
(CACKLING)

12:29.851 --> 12:32.086
Now, that is how
you dicker

12:32.120 --> 12:34.055
you old coon hound.

12:34.088 --> 12:35.123
You can learn something
from him, Wayne.

12:35.156 --> 12:38.159
Always gotta dicker.
Never show up empty‐handed.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.228
‐Brewskis?
‐That was polites of him.

12:40.261 --> 12:41.195
That was polite of him.

12:41.229 --> 12:44.833
Oh, yes. You're in G&T
country now, fella.

12:44.866 --> 12:47.335
Very hospitable. Very
hospitable, very helpful.

12:47.368 --> 12:48.937
‐Thank you.
‐Well, there is my wife.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.205
My well‐wisher.
My whole wide world, baby.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.775
Is it racist to say
that your wife

12:53.808 --> 12:55.844
‐looks like Princess Jasmine?
‐He's a tools.

12:55.877 --> 12:56.878
That's Dierks, baby.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.749
Old long dong himself?

13:02.116 --> 13:03.051
I'm a hugger.

13:03.084 --> 13:05.086
So you gotta get
in here 'cause I'm a hugger.

13:06.487 --> 13:08.523
I'm fucking Hugs Bunny.

13:08.557 --> 13:10.024
‐(MOANS) Oh.
‐There you go, okay.

13:10.058 --> 13:11.459
‐All right, easy.
‐Oh, it's always

13:11.492 --> 13:13.528
nice to meet
another hugger.

13:13.562 --> 13:14.829
Don't she gives some
good hugging there, Dierks?

13:14.863 --> 13:18.032
Oh, you're a good hugger, baby.
You know you're the good hugger.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.367
Okay, we're good.

13:20.902 --> 13:22.537
I got one
for you too, Dan.

13:22.571 --> 13:24.305
Came all the way up here
to meet you, you fucking

13:24.338 --> 13:26.440
gigantic, cheerful loneliness.
Bring it in.

13:26.474 --> 13:28.276
All right. It's gonna
be slightly less intense

13:28.309 --> 13:30.411
‐than your previous hug.
‐Okay.

13:30.444 --> 13:32.146
That is some
good huggings.

13:32.180 --> 13:33.582
‐Hug life.
‐Mmm‐hmm.

13:33.615 --> 13:35.116
‐Daryl.
‐And you.

13:35.149 --> 13:36.284
You must be Rosie.

13:37.952 --> 13:39.220
Then I will be.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.822
You had to tame
this one, didn't you?

13:40.855 --> 13:42.390
Look at you,
you fucking cowboy you.

13:42.423 --> 13:44.092
You know,
Brokeback break my heart.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.494
(WAYNE GRUMBLES)

13:49.964 --> 13:51.099
Where are the lights?

13:51.132 --> 13:52.266
Just on the

13:52.300 --> 13:53.902
ceiling where they
generally are.

13:53.935 --> 13:55.336
Where's the, like,
production team?

13:55.369 --> 13:56.605
You are looking at 'em.

13:56.638 --> 13:57.906
And where's the camera?

13:57.939 --> 13:59.207
Oh, we figured
we'd just take a selfie.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.576
But don't worry.
We've taken hundreds of them.

14:01.610 --> 14:03.878
‐Thousands.
‐Tens of thousands.

14:03.912 --> 14:06.080
We've taken
ten thousand selfies.

14:06.114 --> 14:07.949
(CHUCKLES)
Let's recap.

14:07.982 --> 14:09.117
BROdude Energy has hired me

14:09.150 --> 14:11.185
for a photoshoot
with no camera...

14:11.219 --> 14:13.187
Just this guy.
(IMITATING SHUTTER SOUND)

14:13.221 --> 14:15.156
‐and no lighting.
‐Still on the ceiling

14:15.189 --> 14:17.025
where they generally are.

14:17.058 --> 14:19.060
And no one from
BROdude Energy is even here?

14:19.093 --> 14:20.128
Just us.

14:20.161 --> 14:21.495
I see two dudes
in BROdude hats.

14:24.098 --> 14:25.166
‐Oh.
‐Oh.

14:26.234 --> 14:27.936
Don't worry.
BROdude has asked us

14:27.969 --> 14:29.203
to be brand ambassadors,

14:29.237 --> 14:30.939
but we have to prove
to them

14:30.972 --> 14:33.474
that we can, eh, um,

14:33.508 --> 14:37.278
ambassa... dize.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.447
And once we've proven that
to them we're going straight

14:39.480 --> 14:40.381
to the tippity‐top.

14:40.414 --> 14:42.517
And guess what,
we're taking you with us.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.118
All the way!

‐(SPEAKING FRENCH)
‐Sick.

14:45.486 --> 14:46.988
‐Jonesy.
‐Anik.

14:47.021 --> 14:49.257
We have this sort of,
creative vision

14:49.290 --> 14:51.459
in mind, but
first we'd like to ask

14:51.492 --> 14:53.995
what... what would you say
is like the...

14:55.630 --> 14:57.599
‐Allure?
‐Nice, buddy.

14:57.632 --> 15:00.068
What would you say is the
biggest part of the allure

15:00.101 --> 15:02.036
to your racy Instagram?

15:02.971 --> 15:04.005
‐Tits.
‐Tits!

15:04.038 --> 15:04.906
Titties!

15:04.939 --> 15:06.941
We also thought
that was a major factor.

15:06.975 --> 15:09.210
Not the only factor,
but dudes love titties.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.478
Dudes love titties, boys.

15:10.512 --> 15:12.146
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

15:12.180 --> 15:14.683
‐ Oui.
‐So, with that in mind,

15:14.716 --> 15:16.985
are you ready to begin
