WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:03.967
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York,

00:04.037 --> 00:06.335
until his plane went down
in long island sound.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.533
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings.

00:08.608 --> 00:09.632
Tripp and Letitia.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.269
Which of our children isn't mine?

00:12.345 --> 00:13.505
Brian, the man of God.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.605
Please help the arbitrator
at the custody hearing

00:15.682 --> 00:17.445
to understand that I love my son

00:17.550 --> 00:20.815
and give her the good sense to accept
my generous donation. Amen.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.354
Patrick, the principled politician.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.389
Isn't this something?

00:23.490 --> 00:24.650
You can have one
Saturday night a month,

00:24.757 --> 00:26.122
but the rest of the weekends are ours.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.194
So why exactly would I do this?

00:28.294 --> 00:29.818
Because it's more than
you'll ever have otherwise.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.454
Karen, the professional divorcee.

00:31.564 --> 00:32.588
- Karen Darling.
- Hi.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.632
Do you eat anything yummy?

00:33.733 --> 00:34.859
- Down, girl.
- Shut up.

00:34.934 --> 00:37.061
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.468
I want this girl to like me for me.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.506
You're a Darling.
As soon as she finds that out,

00:40.607 --> 00:41.835
things are never gonna be the same.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.170
Guess she can never find out, then.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.504
What the hell was that?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.681
So how long is it gonna take you
to wrap up this custody hearing?

00:55.755 --> 00:57.723
Brian, this is the fate of your child
we're dealing with,

00:57.790 --> 01:00.258
and custody cases rarely turn out
in favor of the father.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.725
Thanks, never knew that.

01:01.794 --> 01:04.126
Especially in situations where the child
was forced by the father

01:04.197 --> 01:05.960
to lie about being an orphan
from Sweden.

01:06.032 --> 01:09.695
I did the best with what I was given,
situation-wise. Back off.

01:12.939 --> 01:15.373
Oh, in the matter
of Brian Darling versus...

01:15.441 --> 01:16.601
I'm sorry, your honor.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.405
Where are Andrea Smithson
and counsel?

01:18.478 --> 01:20.571
Oh, they've already been notified
that I've ruled in her favor.

01:20.647 --> 01:21.909
She now has full custody

01:21.981 --> 01:23.812
and she can leave the country
at her discretion.

01:23.883 --> 01:26.181
- What the hell is going on?
- Your honor, on what ground...

01:26.252 --> 01:28.015
On the ground
that Brian Darling is under arrest

01:28.121 --> 01:30.954
for attempting to bribe a public official.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.226
- Oh, crap.
- Nice to see you again.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.525
That woman is a complete liar!

01:38.598 --> 01:40.361
Your honor, a moment.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.193
You bribed the arbitrator?

01:44.304 --> 01:47.967
- You told me that we were gonna lose.
- Oh, so it's my fault now?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.770
Bail is set at $5 million.

01:49.842 --> 01:52.333
What are you gonna do about my son?

01:56.482 --> 01:58.712
Why can't we ever
stay at your place?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.946
You wouldn't wanna.
My place is a total sty.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.784
Who cares?
It doesn't have to be perfect.

02:04.557 --> 02:07.390
I can't do it, Sofia. Trust me.
It's for your own good.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.086
- Okay, fine.
- Wet.

02:10.062 --> 02:13.362
But no more pudding for you
until I go there.

02:20.506 --> 02:22.371
Where are you on this pain chart?

02:22.442 --> 02:25.741
About a three.
But that's the morphine talking.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.780
About an eight or a nine
when the meds wear off.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.576
But we're not about to let that happen.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.552
So, you shot me in the leg.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.714
I was aiming for higher.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.689
Where do we go from here, Ellen?

02:38.758 --> 02:39.918
Well...

02:41.327 --> 02:43.090
I'm sorry I shot you.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.061
We both know
we can win this election, Patrick.

02:48.134 --> 02:51.797
And I'm not gonna let you screw it up
with your childish indiscretions.

02:51.871 --> 02:53.099
I'm gonna win.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.437
Not if you lose your wife
in the middle of the campaign.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.533
That a threat?

02:57.610 --> 03:01.171
Patrick, I am not made to share you
with another woman,

03:01.247 --> 03:03.807
or man.

03:03.883 --> 03:08.115
But I thought we had, like, a deal.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.678
Well, I have had a change of heart.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.981
End things with Carmelita

03:13.059 --> 03:16.586
or I will end any shot you have
of a seat in the senate.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.090
Okay.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.966
I'll do it.

03:32.245 --> 03:35.908
Brian should be free on bail
in a few hours, but this is far from over.

03:35.982 --> 03:39.349
- He committed a class c felony.
- What does that actually mean?

03:39.419 --> 03:41.387
Maximum 10 years in prison,

03:41.487 --> 03:43.352
minimum suspended sentence
of one year.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.323
What's your best guess?

03:45.625 --> 03:48.458
I really don't know.
One month in jail, maybe two.

03:48.528 --> 03:51.395
We must know someone
on good terms with this judge.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.488
No.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.696
The belief that we can get away
with pulling strings behind the scenes

03:55.768 --> 03:59.329
is exactly what got Brian
into this position in the first place.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.636
Going that route is utter foolishness,

04:02.709 --> 04:04.768
not to mention unprincipled.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.744
Not to mention illegal.

04:07.447 --> 04:08.880
What about Patrick?

04:08.948 --> 04:10.882
He is the Attorney General
of New York.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.316
Doesn't that count for anything?

04:13.386 --> 04:16.253
Patrick's campaign
is already so compromised

04:16.322 --> 04:19.485
that the slightest whiff of corruption

04:19.591 --> 04:21.617
could completely derail it.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.356
Patrick has denied you,
denounced you,

04:24.430 --> 04:27.490
and gotten into bed with Simon elder,
your greatest enemy,

04:27.567 --> 04:30.434
and yet he's still more important to you
than Brian?

04:30.503 --> 04:32.027
Brian committed a felony.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.472
Because he loves his son,
like fathers are supposed to.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.372
Because he is fueled by contempt.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.911
Contempt permeates
every cell of his being!

04:39.979 --> 04:42.948
What is the point
of having power and money

04:43.015 --> 04:45.506
if we don't use them
to help the children?

04:45.585 --> 04:49.282
- What else are they for?
- Oh, good grief, Tish. The point...

04:49.355 --> 04:52.847
The money compels us
to act impeccably.

04:52.925 --> 04:58.761
If we start to use our influence,
our privilege to pervert justice,

04:58.831 --> 04:59.855
that conduct...

04:59.932 --> 05:03.663
That is the beginning of the end
of us as a family.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.101
As a family?

05:13.212 --> 05:16.477
I think we would all be best served

05:16.549 --> 05:20.110
by reacting honorably to this situation.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.522
All of us, especially Brian.

05:23.589 --> 05:26.683
And if this were Patrick or Karen,
would you be saying the same thing?

05:26.759 --> 05:28.386
Exactly the same.

05:28.895 --> 05:31.193
What Brian needs is our support

05:32.565 --> 05:34.499
while he spends a month or two in jail.

05:37.069 --> 05:39.936
Nick, the children's hospital proposal?

05:42.308 --> 05:44.208
Four hundred million ought to do it.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.711
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.652
Is there something going on
between you and Tripp?

05:56.722 --> 05:58.246
Don't worry about that.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.020
Worry about keeping my son out of jail.

06:03.663 --> 06:07.190
If your father were alive,
he'd know how to handle this.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.632
I'd like to be alone.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.450
- Welcome back, Mr. George.
- Thank you, Howard.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.551
And please, call me Dutch.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.304
Hello, there.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.531
Hello.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.203
- I thought you were up in Valhalla.
- Oh, I snuck out.

06:51.310 --> 06:54.677
I wanted to wish you Happy Birthday
in person.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.112
That's nice.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.856
- You don't like it.
- No, it's beautiful.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.018
- I know it's extravagant.
- Look, it's just...

07:08.094 --> 07:11.325
You know.
I've worn this watch for 30 years.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.298
And it's a gift from my father, and I...

07:14.367 --> 07:19.430
I just can't imagine replacing it.
Now, I am really touched. I really am.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.668
And you are the only one
who remembered my birthday this year.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.901
It's lovely.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.307
Thank you.

07:29.582 --> 07:31.345
Nick didn't call you?

07:31.417 --> 07:32.441
No.

07:32.818 --> 07:35.309
Nick hasn't talked to me in months.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.215
- I was hoping...
- It's okay. It's my fault.

07:39.825 --> 07:43.192
I wasn't there for him,
not the way a parent's supposed to be.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.628
And so he learned to live without me.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.258
Now I have to learn to live without him.

07:48.334 --> 07:52.270
Well, I'm sure that Nick would be open

07:52.338 --> 07:54.898
- to repairing your relationship.
- Uh-uh.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.168
It's too late. It's too late.

07:58.444 --> 08:00.605
God, I know
life is about making mistakes,

08:00.680 --> 08:03.513
but the mistakes you make
with your kids,

08:04.417 --> 08:06.146
they never go away.

08:06.919 --> 08:09.888
They just grow.
They keep growing and growing.

08:16.228 --> 08:17.889
What's the matter?

08:21.434 --> 08:23.664
I've made mistakes, too.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.829
What are you talking about?

08:29.508 --> 08:31.669
Nick is not your only child.

08:51.726 --> 08:54.752
A little privacy, please?
This is all a big misunderstanding.

08:54.829 --> 08:56.387
Get a life, vulture!

08:56.464 --> 08:58.625
Please tell me that you did something
to get my son back.

08:58.733 --> 09:00.496
- Something.
- Hey, I just got you out of jail, Brian.

09:00.568 --> 09:02.433
- How about a thank you?
- Send yourself a gift basket.

09:02.503 --> 09:03.595
What are we gonna do?

09:03.671 --> 09:05.229
You got me, sunshine. We're screwed.

09:13.781 --> 09:15.078
- Jeremy?
- Hey, Lisa.

09:15.149 --> 09:17.117
- Hey.
- Is Nick here?

09:17.185 --> 09:21.144
Actually, he's bailing your brother
out of jail. What's going on?

09:21.589 --> 09:23.955
- What are you looking for?
- Bingo.

09:24.625 --> 09:27.788
Is it cool
if I borrow your place tomorrow night?

09:28.362 --> 09:30.227
- Jeremy.
- What? I'm not driving.

09:30.298 --> 09:32.562
- You're a valet.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

09:32.633 --> 09:35.864
- So can I use your place?
- For what?

09:35.937 --> 09:37.905
Well, this girl I'm into
doesn't know who I am.

09:38.005 --> 09:40.906
- She thinks I'm poor.
- What gave her that idea?

09:40.975 --> 09:43.409
- I told her I was poor.
- Ah.

09:43.478 --> 09:46.174
So I just need a place that looks like
a poor guy would live there, you know.

09:46.247 --> 09:47.976
Jeremy, we're not poor.

09:48.049 --> 09:50.074
Those ants look pretty low-budge.

09:50.151 --> 09:52.312
Those ants cost 12,000 bucks.

09:52.386 --> 09:54.081
Proving my point.

09:54.155 --> 09:57.124
Look, I'll pay you if you want,
you know, if you could use the cash.

09:57.191 --> 09:59.955
I have a better idea.
How about you tell her the truth,

10:00.061 --> 10:01.926
get to know each other as people?

10:01.996 --> 10:03.486
I like your style, Lise.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.829
That ship has sailed.

10:08.870 --> 10:11.031
What a pleasant surprise.

10:11.138 --> 10:15.666
It's so interesting of you
to come visit me, Karen.

10:17.812 --> 10:19.677
- How's Freddy?
- We got divorced

10:19.747 --> 10:21.715
the day we got married, pat.
You were there.

10:21.782 --> 10:24.945
Oh, right. Right, right. Kudos on that.

10:25.019 --> 10:28.580
- And you're still on morphine.
- Yes, indeed.

10:29.924 --> 10:33.291
I feel like I'm filled
with lime green neon.

10:33.394 --> 10:36.363
Well, captain neon,

10:36.430 --> 10:39.695
as a voting member of the board
of Darling enterprises,

10:39.767 --> 10:42.736
I'm gonna need you to sign
some tax stuff for the foundation.

10:42.837 --> 10:44.702
It's quarter-end stuff.

10:44.772 --> 10:48.071
Okay, let me help you with that.

10:50.077 --> 10:51.510
Good enough.

10:52.647 --> 10:54.114
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:54.181 --> 10:56.308
Oh, hey, Simon. What you doing here?

10:56.384 --> 10:58.147
- Simon.
- Hey, Patrick.

10:58.252 --> 11:00.812
I just have a little business
to discuss with your brother.

11:00.922 --> 11:04.153
Okay, I was just leaving.

11:04.692 --> 11:07.957
Hospitals kind of freak me out, anyway,
you know? It's like, death!

11:08.029 --> 11:11.487
I'm coming for you, Karen!
Here I come! It's like...

11:11.566 --> 11:13.727
Just the way they hit me sometimes.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.495
Hey, Karen. Karen.

11:16.704 --> 11:20.140
I know you're very involved
in philanthropy,

11:20.207 --> 11:21.936
and I wondered
if you'd have any interest

11:22.009 --> 11:25.308
in merging some of our resources

11:26.347 --> 11:27.974
for a good cause.

11:28.649 --> 11:30.014
Hello, mama!

11:31.285 --> 11:36.348
I don't usually merge my resources
with virtual strangers.

11:37.525 --> 11:40.858
Then maybe you'd be up
for discussing charitable giving

11:40.928 --> 11:42.555
over dinner some time.

11:42.630 --> 11:45.463
I've got your charitable giving
right here.

11:45.733 --> 11:49.499
I'll consider it,
but don't hold your breath.

11:50.271 --> 11:52.239
My family loved that building
you tore down.

11:52.340 --> 11:57.175
She and dad have always had
some kind of connection.

11:57.244 --> 11:58.871
Yeah, it's called family.

11:58.946 --> 12:00.072
Um...

12:01.015 --> 12:02.710
Speaking of which,

12:02.783 --> 12:06.241
are you still planning on calling dad

12:06.320 --> 12:10.416
and having him testify in
this Fantini brothers real estate thing?

12:11.859 --> 12:15.351
Actually, that was what
we were about to discuss.

12:15.429 --> 12:16.794
Fine. Okay.

12:18.065 --> 12:19.327
Bye, pat.

12:20.501 --> 12:21.968
Sweet dreams.

12:23.404 --> 12:24.496
- Bye.
- Take care, Karen.

12:26.841 --> 12:29.139
When did you get back?
- A few hours ago.

12:29.210 --> 12:32.475
I'm sorry I'm late to dinner,
but this jet lag is crippling.

12:32.546 --> 12:36.073
- Just had to take a nap.
- I tried to let you sleep, dear.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.710
So, what did I miss?

12:38.786 --> 12:40.048
Brian could be going to jail.

12:40.121 --> 12:42.749
- Brian, no!
- That's an exaggeration.

12:42.823 --> 12:46.281
Well, I'm sure whatever happens,
Nick will take care of it, won't he?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.793
No. Actually, it's all Nick's fault.

12:47.862 --> 12:51.229
How can you blame Nick
for your systemic malfeasance?

12:51.332 --> 12:52.765
I'm not blaming Nick
for my malfeasance,

12:52.833 --> 12:55.768
but I lost my son because
of his incompetence and disregard.

12:55.836 --> 12:59.135
I find your notion
that Nick is incompetent absurd.

12:59.206 --> 13:01.572
Well, I know, but, dad,
that's because he has you snowed.

13:01.676 --> 13:02.904
Just like Dutch did.

13:02.977 --> 13:05.138
Could we get some butter
for the rolls?

13:05.246 --> 13:06.611
Those rolls...

13:06.714 --> 13:08.375
Dutch, don't do this.

13:08.449 --> 13:11.612
Dutch, don't go. We're not done.

13:11.719 --> 13:14.085
I cannot talk about this anymore!

13:14.188 --> 13:16.156
Please don't leave angry.
Don't leave angry.

13:16.223 --> 13:19.192
I am gonna be angry about this
for the rest of my life.

13:19.293 --> 13:22.854
I tried to tell you so many times.
I wasn't sure you wanted to know.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.558
When? When did you try to tell me?

13:26.967 --> 13:29.128
I couldn't get up the courage.

13:29.236 --> 13:31.466
I was afraid you'd leave me.

13:33.007 --> 13:34.269
Please.

13:34.341 --> 13:36.241
It's fitting, actually.

13:36.577 --> 13:40.343
All this time
that I have been lying to Tripp

13:40.414 --> 13:43.906
and agonizing over it,
you were lying to me,

13:43.984 --> 13:46.612
which is exactly what I deserve.

13:46.687 --> 13:48.780
It makes perfect sense.

13:48.856 --> 13:52.952
Why should I expect to be treated
any better than your husband?

13:54.028 --> 13:56.963
Dutch, I love you

13:57.031 --> 13:59.192
and I know that you love me.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.995
We'll survive this.

14:01.469 --> 14:04.996
Nick was right about you people.
He was right all along.

14:06.974 --> 14:09.135
I have to get away from you.

14:09.243 --> 14:12.144
From all of you, before it's too late.

14:22.702 --> 14:24.761
You ready? Here goes.

14:26.579 --> 14:27.637
Wow.

14:29.782 --> 14:31.249
This place is

14:33.887 --> 14:35.149
not good.

14:36.022 --> 14:37.990
I know, right? But I...

14:38.057 --> 14:40.287
It's, like...
It's the best I can do, you know?

14:40.360 --> 14:44.888
I'm cool with it
because I have no choice. I'm poor.

14:44.964 --> 14:46.727
So, uh,

14:47.500 --> 14:49.229
what do you say,
now that we've seen Hooverville,

14:49.302 --> 14:52.760
why don't we head back to your place,
get some pudding?

14:53.339 --> 14:55.000
Can we talk first?

14:56.442 --> 14:57.500
What about?

14:59.712 --> 15:01.680
I wanted to talk with you about Brazil.

15:01.781 --> 15:03.339
- Brazil.
- Brazil.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.984
Speaking as a parent,
I think you're making a mistake.

15:07.053 --> 15:10.022
I'm not.
I'm finally doing something right.

15:10.089 --> 15:11.556
I just thought that you wanted Brian Jr.

15:11.624 --> 15:13.990
To reap the benefits of being born
into the Darling family.

15:14.093 --> 15:17.722
That was before I realized
what that family is capable of.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.224
And before I went to Brazil.

15:21.334 --> 15:23.234
Andrea, I don't think you want
to deprive your son

15:23.303 --> 15:26.136
of the father he's just getting to know.

15:26.205 --> 15:28.639
He made him into a Swedish orphan.

15:29.542 --> 15:33.410
Look, I know this isn't gonna be easy
for Brian Jr.,

15:33.479 --> 15:35.504
but it's also what's best.

15:39.118 --> 15:42.884
See, between the people like you
that the Darlings pay to get things done

15:42.989 --> 15:47.153
and the simple fact that both Brian
and his money are so attractive,

15:48.127 --> 15:49.594
we have to get away,

15:49.662 --> 15:51.994
for my own safety and my son's.

15:57.904 --> 16:01.863
I know it's not all ritzy,
but I'm just a valet, doll face.

16:02.742 --> 16:05.506
So, you have no goals,

16:05.578 --> 16:08.240
no dreams, no hopes.

16:08.314 --> 16:09.611
Nothing.

16:09.682 --> 16:13.311
Well, I do wanna go to space
at some point.

16:13.386 --> 16:15.752
Like, for real. Like, space is...

16:15.855 --> 16:17.720
It's kind of my thing.

16:19.926 --> 16:23.089
- This is not going to work out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

16:23.162 --> 16:24.720
What? Is this because I'm poor?

16:24.797 --> 16:27.027
Because you know what?
That is, like, financial racism.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.228
No. It's not because you're poor.

16:30.303 --> 16:33.272
It's because you don't care
that you're poor.

16:33.339 --> 16:37.036
I need to be with someone
who wants to go somewhere.

16:37.110 --> 16:39.271
I do. I wanna go to space!

16:40.046 --> 16:41.604
I am sorry.

16:41.681 --> 16:43.649
All right, Sofia. Wait.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.240
- Just let me explain.
- I know.

16:45.318 --> 16:47.411
And something is, like,
biting me or something!

16:47.487 --> 16:50.012
All right. Little bastard. Okay, look.

16:51.691 --> 16:53.818
I should have told you this
a long time ago.

16:53.893 --> 16:55.360
Told me what?

16:56.996 --> 16:59.021
The truth about who I am.

16:59.098 --> 17:00.998
- Hello, Nick.
- Letitia.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.399
I assume you heard the charges
against Brian have been dropped.

17:03.469 --> 17:05.232
Yes. Such good news.

17:05.938 --> 17:07.838
And given Tripp's feelings
about the matter,

17:07.906 --> 17:10.396
I assume you had something
to do with it.

17:10.476 --> 17:12.568
I did what I had to, Nick.

17:12.645 --> 17:14.738
You'd do the same for Kiki.

17:15.681 --> 17:18.205
And what exactly did you do?

17:18.917 --> 17:20.351
You don't need to concern yourself
with that.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.854
The point is it's taken care of.

17:25.525 --> 17:28.790
Letitia, I cannot be in the position
of representing the family...

17:28.861 --> 17:31.421
You're not in any position, Nick.

17:31.497 --> 17:34.227
You follow your conscience,
you speak your piece

17:34.300 --> 17:38.066
and we'll all do what occurs to us to do.
It's a good system.

17:38.704 --> 17:42.606
And you're right most of the time,
just not about this.

17:43.709 --> 17:46.337
And, if you could keep this between us,

17:46.412 --> 17:47.970
I'd greatly appreciate it.

17:48.047 --> 17:49.708
You want me to keep this from Tripp?

17:49.782 --> 17:51.647
He has so much faith
in your legal abilities,

17:51.717 --> 17:53.651
he'll just assume
it's another one of your victories.

17:53.719 --> 17:55.380
You want me to lie to Tripp?

17:55.455 --> 17:58.618
Well, Tripp sometimes feels
that helping the children is indulgent.

17:58.724 --> 18:00.817
Letitia, I can name
at least five occasions

18:00.893 --> 18:02.986
where Tripp has gone out of his way,
behind the scenes,

18:03.062 --> 18:05.326
to make things happen
for Patrick, Karen, Juliet...

18:05.398 --> 18:08.561
He picks and chooses his favorites.
That's no secret.

18:16.309 --> 18:18.869
What are you trying to hide, Letitia?

18:22.715 --> 18:24.615
What won't you tell me?

18:30.857 --> 18:35.317
It's... it's difficult to explain.

18:37.163 --> 18:38.687
Give it a shot.

18:40.099 --> 18:41.225
Uh...

18:43.436 --> 18:47.372
Information has recently come to light,
information that

18:49.609 --> 18:52.840
Tripp has had trouble
coming to terms with.

18:52.912 --> 18:55.073
Not that I blame him at all.

18:58.151 --> 19:00.711
You know, Letitia,
the last time I saw my dad,

19:00.820 --> 19:02.344
before he died,

19:03.556 --> 19:06.252
he said some things
I didn't understand.

19:07.527 --> 19:09.620
And now you're starting to.

19:11.197 --> 19:13.563
Now, we all are.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.601
Everything is happening.

19:18.304 --> 19:19.771
Go ahead.

19:19.839 --> 19:24.742
After I told him about my affair,

19:27.246 --> 19:31.012
Tripp blackmailed my ob-gyn.
He was...

19:32.919 --> 19:35.615
He was sure that the twins weren't his.

19:37.823 --> 19:39.450
But he was wrong.

19:39.892 --> 19:40.950
Yes.

19:42.962 --> 19:44.930
And Brian is my brother.

19:46.766 --> 19:48.859
Brian is your brother.

19:58.306 --> 20:00.274
It could have been Karen.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.270
Oh, thanks a lot, Lisa,
you're a big help.

20:02.343 --> 20:05.369
Well, look at it like this.
It's a fresh start for you and Brian.

20:06.180 --> 20:09.206
I'm not especially sure
I want a fresh start for me and Brian.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.911
You know,
when I was in the fifth grade,

20:11.986 --> 20:13.886
I'd saved up my allowance
to buy this book,

20:13.955 --> 20:15.786
where the red fern grows.

20:15.856 --> 20:18.324
I'm sitting in the lobby of Darling Plaza
waiting for my dad,

20:18.392 --> 20:20.451
reading the book,
and Brian walks by and he says,

20:20.528 --> 20:23.588
"oh, I read that book last year.
The dogs die. "

20:23.998 --> 20:25.056
And I don't know what came over me,

20:25.132 --> 20:26.497
but I just tore the book in half,

20:26.601 --> 20:29.764
threw it in the trash can
and never finished reading it.

20:29.837 --> 20:30.895
And knowing Brian is my brother

20:30.972 --> 20:32.405
makes me want to do that
with my whole life.

20:32.473 --> 20:34.805
- Your whole life?
- It's a feeling, Lisa.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.775
Obviously I'm not talking
about you and Kiki.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.869
So, why do you keep working for them?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.311
Come on, Lisa, you know why.

20:40.414 --> 20:41.745
No, I don't.

20:41.816 --> 20:44.580
Whatever you find out there
is not going to bring your dad back in...

20:44.685 --> 20:45.811
This isn't about my dad.

20:45.886 --> 20:49.583
I finally have a chance
to make a real impact on the world.

20:49.890 --> 20:55.226
I am going to build a $400 million
pediatric cancer research center.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.196
And I can't do that
without the Darlings' money.

20:57.265 --> 20:59.495
There is just no possible way.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.125
No possible way.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.161
I'm just... I'm stuck, you know?

21:04.238 --> 21:05.330
Yeah.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.736
It's about the money.

21:09.110 --> 21:10.202
Yeah.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.742
It's about the money.

21:21.922 --> 21:23.253
Excuse me.

21:24.959 --> 21:27.223
- No kiss?
- No.

21:27.295 --> 21:29.058
Someone might see.

21:29.163 --> 21:31.393
Come on. What's one last kiss?

21:32.300 --> 21:33.631
Last kiss?

21:35.002 --> 21:38.301
Well, yeah, you know, last kiss today.

21:38.372 --> 21:42.206
Last kiss this minute.
Last kiss with our clothes on.

21:44.078 --> 21:45.739
You're messed up.

21:47.748 --> 21:49.909
And I'm trying to be careful.

21:52.486 --> 21:54.784
She's not gonna shoot you, too.

21:56.590 --> 22:00.356
The firearms chapter
of my marriage is over.

22:02.496 --> 22:03.656
I hope.

22:04.999 --> 22:07.024
She must really love you,

22:07.101 --> 22:09.467
you know, to shoot you like that.

22:11.238 --> 22:13.331
Guess that's a word for it.

22:15.810 --> 22:17.471
Are you all right?

22:23.317 --> 22:25.444
Yeah, of course.

22:27.021 --> 22:29.854
Paddy, if you need to simplify your life,

22:31.325 --> 22:33.885
and just be with Ellen, I understand.

22:36.097 --> 22:38.224
I just want you to be happy.

22:48.943 --> 22:49.967
No.

22:52.146 --> 22:53.238
Come.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.179
Ellen can shoot me all she wants,

23:01.255 --> 23:04.986
but it's being away from you
that's really killing me.

23:07.728 --> 23:10.094
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

23:22.977 --> 23:24.308
Last kiss?

23:29.483 --> 23:31.713
- Okay.
- I need serious help.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.550
Jeremy, I told you, you cannot use
our place for your poor house.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.180
I don't want to.

23:36.757 --> 23:38.588
I bought a little studio in the Bronx,

23:38.659 --> 23:40.752
hired a Broadway designer
to make it look all ratty

23:40.828 --> 23:42.125
and I showed it to Sofia.

23:42.196 --> 23:44.426
- So problem solved.
- Not quite.

23:44.498 --> 23:47.433
She wanted to dump me
because I had no goals.

23:47.835 --> 23:50.201
- So I told her...
- The truth? Good for you.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.067
No. I told her I was an artist.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.903
- Good one.
- Yeah. I panicked.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.636
Because she was grilling me
and, you know,

23:56.710 --> 23:57.972
I started thinking about you
and your ants,

23:58.045 --> 23:59.171
and how you work in a gallery,

23:59.246 --> 24:00.804
and so I figured
you could just hook me up.

24:00.915 --> 24:02.473
You need to stop lying to this woman.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.050
- No, I can't!
- Why?

24:04.118 --> 24:06.211
Because I want her to love me for me!

24:06.287 --> 24:09.381
- Jeremy, you are not a struggling artist.
- Sure, I am.

24:09.457 --> 24:11.357
I am an artist of life.

24:14.061 --> 24:17.758
Can you just hook me up
with, like, five paintings, please?

24:19.366 --> 24:21.425
So you didn't seem surprised.

24:21.502 --> 24:22.662
'Cause I knew you'd call.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.600
I didn't.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.304
I usually keep people guessing.

24:28.809 --> 24:30.777
Ask any of my four ex-husbands.

24:30.878 --> 24:31.936
- Ah.
- Mmm.

24:33.414 --> 24:35.712
- So are you on good terms with them?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:35.783 --> 24:37.148
All but one.

24:37.618 --> 24:39.051
Freddy, you know, the last one,

24:39.119 --> 24:41.349
I think he's still a little stung
by the one-day turnaround,

24:41.422 --> 24:43.652
but he'll get over it.
You were married once, right?

24:45.726 --> 24:48.854
I was and we're still quite close.

24:48.929 --> 24:52.228
She's a special woman, a princess.

24:52.299 --> 24:55.427
Oh, yeah, I get it. She's special.

24:55.503 --> 24:58.597
No, seriously.
She's a princess, from Ghana.

24:58.672 --> 24:59.696
Of course.

24:59.773 --> 25:03.709
I still think of her
as my primary partner in life,

25:03.777 --> 25:05.870
even though we've legally split.

25:05.946 --> 25:09.643
But we have a child together
and there's a deep connection.

25:12.853 --> 25:14.980
I don't know.
I guess it's hard for me to let go.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.420
I like that.

25:18.359 --> 25:21.522
I didn't come here looking
for a primary partner.

25:22.997 --> 25:24.624
Yeah, I got that.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.760
So I thought we could...

25:27.835 --> 25:32.795
I thought we could start things off
by talking about charitable giving.

25:33.841 --> 25:36.207
- Really?
- Yeah, 'cause I...

25:37.945 --> 25:39.674
I just love giving.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.380
It's an art form.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.457
So, like, what's with the numbers?

25:53.561 --> 25:55.188
Isn't it amazing?

25:55.496 --> 25:57.726
She painted it
when she got married last month.

25:57.798 --> 25:59.459
It represents indivisibility.

25:59.533 --> 26:01.797
Math is not really my thing.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.262
Okay.

26:06.574 --> 26:08.303
How about this one?

26:10.344 --> 26:12.369
It's a... it's a blue dot.

26:14.915 --> 26:16.780
- Not me.
- You sure?

26:16.850 --> 26:19.375
Yeah, I'm pretty sure about it.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.479
You might have a blue dot
somewhere deep inside.

26:22.556 --> 26:25.423
Art shows us images
of our internal structures.

26:25.492 --> 26:27.983
It helps us see parts of ourselves.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.931
Nick's lucky to have you.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.130
Thank you.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.626
- I like naked people.
- Excuse me?

26:37.705 --> 26:39.195
Like these over here.

26:39.273 --> 26:42.800
You know, I think I could fake it
as someone who paints naked people.

26:42.876 --> 26:45.208
You know, I could talk the talk.

26:45.279 --> 26:48.248
Okay, let's start by calling them nudes.

26:48.315 --> 26:51.284
All right. Wet. Nudes!

26:52.486 --> 26:55.649
Jeremy Babeson loves his nudes.
Let's nude it up.

27:01.428 --> 27:03.055
I know this is

27:04.098 --> 27:05.360
a lot to deal with.

27:05.432 --> 27:07.559
Were you ever gonna tell me?

27:07.801 --> 27:09.894
You know, if Nick hadn't forced you to?

27:09.970 --> 27:12.700
Dutch and I were planning to tell you
and then...

27:12.773 --> 27:16.504
And then he died and I thought,
why burden you with...

27:16.577 --> 27:18.807
You let me spend my whole life

27:19.880 --> 27:21.108
hating him.

27:21.181 --> 27:24.344
Would it have changed anything
if you'd known?

27:28.288 --> 27:29.380
Yeah.

27:32.826 --> 27:35.192
Is this why you always kept me
at a distance?

27:35.262 --> 27:36.889
Is this why
you always pushed me away?

27:36.964 --> 27:39.728
- I've done no such thing!
- Sure you have.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.301
Is this why?
Because I could've blown your cover?

27:42.369 --> 27:44.132
I've never pushed you away.

27:44.238 --> 27:46.604
You pushed me right out of this house
and into the seminary.

27:46.674 --> 27:48.437
I never fit, I never belonged.

27:48.509 --> 27:51.569
Whatever I did,
I did to protect you, not me!

27:51.645 --> 27:53.613
You did it to save yourself!

27:53.714 --> 27:55.204
Just admit it.

27:57.484 --> 27:59.748
At least now I know
why I feel like such an alien.

27:59.820 --> 28:00.946
Oh, Brian.

28:01.021 --> 28:02.989
How long has Tripp known?

28:03.624 --> 28:06.855
- You can still call him dad.
- How long has he known?

28:06.927 --> 28:09.088
- A few weeks.
- How'd he take it?

28:09.163 --> 28:12.724
He was angry at me. But not at you.

28:12.833 --> 28:15.768
- He loves you just the same.
- Right.

28:15.836 --> 28:18.327
- That's the truth.
- I've had quite a day.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.873
I've lost two fathers and a son.

28:20.941 --> 28:23.307
Please get the hell away from me.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.453
Not a word.

28:46.734 --> 28:49.635
Why didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you ask?

28:49.703 --> 28:52.137
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

28:52.873 --> 28:56.741
You must have wondered
when you found out about the affair.

28:56.810 --> 28:58.505
I, for sure, did.

28:58.579 --> 28:59.671
Yeah.

29:00.314 --> 29:03.078
It crossed my mind
Karen might be my sister.

29:03.183 --> 29:05.708
Thought it best to leave that alone.

29:06.487 --> 29:12.255
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was honor bound not to tell.

29:12.326 --> 29:15.386
- Honor bound? Honor bound to whom?
- To Letitia.

29:18.031 --> 29:19.589
I submitted to her beliefs

29:19.700 --> 29:25.161
that the unraveling
of nearly 40 years of ties

29:25.239 --> 29:27.537
would be the undoing of the family.

29:27.608 --> 29:30.975
But I'm not talking about the family!
I'm just talking about me!

29:31.044 --> 29:33.706
- Well, you're a part of the family.
- Oh, no, I'm not!

29:33.781 --> 29:37.148
Well, you're a part of the family to me.
Listen, you want to be angry,

29:37.251 --> 29:40.015
you be angry at Letitia,
be angry at Dutch.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.554
They're the ones
who spawned this disaster.

29:42.623 --> 29:45.888
They're the ones
who left us to pick up the pieces.

29:48.028 --> 29:49.689
I'm just saying
I wish you would have told me.

29:49.763 --> 29:52.926
I think it would have been
the right thing to do.

29:53.433 --> 29:55.401
Well, you didn't tell me.

29:55.969 --> 30:00.099
You knew about the affair
way before I did and you didn't tell me.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.937
- Come on.
- No.

30:04.444 --> 30:06.708
No one says everything.

30:06.780 --> 30:07.872
Yeah.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.082
Well, you're right.
No one says everything.

30:12.152 --> 30:13.619
You're right.

30:16.290 --> 30:18.656
But I lost my mother,

30:18.725 --> 30:20.693
I lost my father,

30:20.794 --> 30:24.161
I lost my whole childhood
to your family. You owe me!

30:25.999 --> 30:28.058
- I owe you?
- Yes!

30:30.704 --> 30:33.195
You owe me the truth. That's all.

30:34.308 --> 30:36.071
You owe me the truth.

31:09.671 --> 31:11.434
Did you sleep at all?

31:12.107 --> 31:14.075
I'm gonna run to the gym.

31:16.545 --> 31:19.514
Give Kiki a hug and a kiss for me,
all right?

31:26.989 --> 31:29.890
- Wait. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

31:30.726 --> 31:32.250
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:45.140 --> 31:48.109
Look who's up.
- Hi.

31:48.176 --> 31:49.234
Hey.

31:50.646 --> 31:53.979
Listen, I'm going to mombasa
next weekend,

31:54.716 --> 31:57.014
opening up a clinic and a school.

31:57.085 --> 31:59.986
And I would love for you
to come with me.

32:00.055 --> 32:03.616
And after all, this was supposed to be
about charitable giving, right?

32:03.692 --> 32:07.958
Oh, I'm sorry, I never go
to Mozambique on a second date.

32:09.331 --> 32:12.027
- Kenya.
- Oh, yeah. I can.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.330
I just don't know that I will.

32:14.836 --> 32:17.066
Oh, look at that. My goodness.

32:17.706 --> 32:19.867
Is that you playing hard to get?

32:19.975 --> 32:22.739
I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure.

32:23.578 --> 32:24.636
Hey.

32:26.815 --> 32:30.546
I don't want you to do to my dad
what you did to Darling Plaza,

32:30.619 --> 32:31.984
or me for that matter.

32:32.054 --> 32:33.282
I won't.

32:33.855 --> 32:35.186
I promise.

32:36.692 --> 32:39.627
I just want what's best for everybody.

32:41.730 --> 32:43.095
- Okay?
- Okay.

32:45.233 --> 32:48.066
My dad can never find out
about this, okay?

32:48.870 --> 32:52.237
Telling Tripp Darling
what I'm about to do to his daughter,

32:52.307 --> 32:54.935
believe me,
is the last thing on my mind.

32:55.010 --> 32:56.910
What's the first thing?

32:58.947 --> 33:01.711
- These are amazing.
- Why, thank you.

33:01.817 --> 33:05.878
With that one, I really wanted
to transcend the mundane, you know,

33:05.954 --> 33:08.582
make the body really speak.

33:09.791 --> 33:12.419
I feel so bad that I doubted you.

33:13.161 --> 33:15.129
Why you never showed me this?

33:15.230 --> 33:18.131
Well, you see,
that's the life of a solitary artist.

33:18.200 --> 33:22.830
It's just me and my paints
and my other paints.

33:23.205 --> 33:27.904
See, I wanted you to like me for me,
not for my mad ski-zills, you know?

33:30.445 --> 33:32.345
Do you think I could...

33:32.614 --> 33:34.946
Oh, yeah. You know, sure.
Take whichever one you want.

33:35.017 --> 33:37.110
I mean, like,
they are my children to me,

33:37.185 --> 33:40.086
but, like, the ones that I give away.

33:41.790 --> 33:43.553
I was going to say

33:44.826 --> 33:47.454
I want you to paint one of me.

33:47.529 --> 33:48.894
You know...

33:50.665 --> 33:51.825
Naked?

33:51.967 --> 33:55.061
I was thinking nude.

33:58.273 --> 34:00.241
But let's start tomorrow.

34:00.308 --> 34:04.870
You know what? Today, I really want
to get to know my subject.

34:04.946 --> 34:06.914
Do a little case study.

34:19.159 --> 34:23.062
- What are you doing here?
- I came to wish you a Happy Birthday.

34:23.998 --> 34:26.489
Oh, sorry.

34:26.734 --> 34:29.033
- Me.
- You've been drinking.

34:30.170 --> 34:31.900
Just a little.

34:31.973 --> 34:33.940
Think that's a good idea?

34:34.042 --> 34:36.601
It has not been a very good birthday.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.406
God, I would do everything

34:42.484 --> 34:45.385
to go back to the beginning
and start again.

34:46.154 --> 34:48.520
I would do everything differently.

34:48.621 --> 34:50.283
Only I'd...

34:50.358 --> 34:52.917
I'd fall in love with your mom again.

34:54.562 --> 34:57.053
And I would be your father forever.

34:57.332 --> 35:00.062
Those things would not change.

35:03.905 --> 35:06.396
Well, I better head up,
Lisa made dinner.

35:06.475 --> 35:08.841
So, Happy Birthday, dad.
Get yourself a cup of coffee.

35:08.910 --> 35:12.812
Listen, I need to talk to you
about the Darlings.

35:12.881 --> 35:14.781
Why am I not surprised?

35:15.650 --> 35:17.709
- There's something you should know.
- I don't care!

35:17.786 --> 35:19.947
I don't care about the Darlings!

35:20.021 --> 35:21.989
I don't wanna know their secrets.
I don't want them in my life.

35:22.057 --> 35:23.991
They're not my family.

35:24.059 --> 35:27.153
Except for Kiki and Lisa, no one is.

35:27.229 --> 35:30.858
That's not true
because I am and they are.

35:31.733 --> 35:35.567
And no matter how hard you try
to distance yourself from them,

35:36.671 --> 35:38.434
they always will be.

35:40.108 --> 35:41.973
And it's my fault.

35:42.043 --> 35:44.978
And I am sorry about that.

35:45.046 --> 35:49.210
- I am very sorry, it is my fault.
- Dad. You know what, dad? Let's...

35:49.351 --> 35:52.286
I want you to have grandpa's watch.

35:54.189 --> 35:55.918
Here, take it.

35:55.991 --> 35:58.152
- I don't want it.
- For all of the...

35:59.194 --> 36:02.288
The birthdays that I forgot.

36:02.364 --> 36:04.195
- I don't want the watch.
- Just take it.

36:04.266 --> 36:05.597
- I got a new one.
- Dad...

36:05.667 --> 36:08.534
As a gift to me, all right?
On my birthday.

36:10.639 --> 36:15.269
- Just take the damn watch!
- Okay, fine. Thank you.

36:17.078 --> 36:18.409
I'm sorry.

36:20.148 --> 36:21.479
I mean it.

36:23.151 --> 36:26.245
I am so, so sorry

36:27.756 --> 36:29.280
for everything.

36:31.126 --> 36:32.650
I got it wrong.

36:35.163 --> 36:36.323
Wait...

36:42.204 --> 36:43.637
That was the last time
you saw him?

36:43.705 --> 36:45.036
Yeah.

36:46.007 --> 36:47.770
And I know he was trying to tell me
about Brian.

36:47.876 --> 36:50.106
- You can't be sure.
- I think I can.

36:50.178 --> 36:53.545
That was the first time he took a drink
in I don't know how long.

36:53.648 --> 36:56.082
He probably just found out from Letitia
that Brian was his kid

36:56.151 --> 36:59.314
and he wanted to tell me,
wanted to talk to me about it.

36:59.421 --> 37:01.389
And I didn't want to listen.
I just shut him down.

37:01.456 --> 37:03.822
Nick, you can't beat yourself up.

37:04.259 --> 37:06.193
He was a terrible father,
he was never around.

37:06.261 --> 37:08.729
You practically raised yourself.
He forced your mom...

37:08.797 --> 37:11.493
And that's all true, Lisa,

37:13.368 --> 37:16.462
but it was the last time I saw him
and he needed me,

37:17.739 --> 37:19.866
and I turned my back on him.

37:20.575 --> 37:23.305
- You didn't know.
- No. No, I didn't.

37:25.914 --> 37:27.381
But I do now.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.150
What are you gonna say to him?

37:39.756 --> 37:41.314
I have no idea.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.028
Look, I know I said
I wouldn't bug you again,

37:52.102 --> 37:53.797
but it's an emergency
and you weren't picking up.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.531
What happened?
- Good morning, Jeremy.

37:55.605 --> 37:57.038
Sofia wants me to paint her.

37:57.107 --> 37:59.268
- Since when do you paint?
- I don't! Keep up, Nick.

37:59.376 --> 38:01.139
I told you yesterday
this was a bad idea.

38:01.211 --> 38:03.441
Why didn't you listen, Jeremy?

38:04.080 --> 38:05.570
Would somebody please tell me
what's going on?

38:05.649 --> 38:08.948
Shh! Lisa,
I don't need the lecture, okay?

38:09.019 --> 38:11.078
You know, what I need is
the artist's phone number

38:11.154 --> 38:13.019
so that I can take a picture of Sofia

38:13.089 --> 38:16.820
and he can paint her naked
and then I can say that I did it.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.652
Okay.

38:19.496 --> 38:21.862
But I'm gonna need
a little time, all right?

38:21.965 --> 38:23.694
You're the wettest.

38:27.437 --> 38:28.961
Call you later.

38:35.945 --> 38:38.914
You have got a great sense of humor.

38:49.292 --> 38:50.623
Of course.

39:00.603 --> 39:03.299
- What's this?
- It belonged to my father.

39:04.808 --> 39:06.173
Our father.

39:08.311 --> 39:11.075
I don't know,
I thought you might want it.

39:14.784 --> 39:16.012
I don't.

39:21.458 --> 39:22.550
Okay.

39:25.061 --> 39:28.224
Nothing's changing, you know,
between you and me.

39:30.533 --> 39:31.693
I see.

39:32.502 --> 39:34.402
And even if we're related,

39:34.804 --> 39:37.432
we're not family and we never will be.

39:39.109 --> 39:40.440
Now, wait.

39:43.079 --> 39:44.171
What?

39:46.449 --> 39:47.814
What, Brian?

39:50.420 --> 39:52.388
How many more awful things
do you want to say to me?

39:52.455 --> 39:54.355
I'm in the same boat you are.

39:54.424 --> 39:56.324
We both got a raw deal.

39:56.693 --> 40:00.254
We're brothers and our father's dead
so don't let that change anything.

40:00.330 --> 40:02.821
Just wrap yourself up
in the comfort of your meanness

40:02.899 --> 40:04.867
and your self-pity and just say it.

40:04.934 --> 40:07.368
Say you hate me. Get it over with.

40:08.371 --> 40:09.463
Fine.

40:09.873 --> 40:11.238
I hate you.

40:11.541 --> 40:13.168
Just sit down, please?

40:16.413 --> 40:17.641
Come on.

40:18.748 --> 40:20.841
This is what church is for,

40:21.751 --> 40:23.719
dragging the ruined past

40:24.220 --> 40:27.383
through the messy present
into the perfect future,

40:27.457 --> 40:29.425
and ruining it, together.

40:31.361 --> 40:33.659
Come on. Just sit down, please.

40:43.039 --> 40:44.370
Thank you.

40:45.575 --> 40:47.099
You're welcome.

40:54.651 --> 40:57.779
Okay, so I want you to eat healthy,
do your homework

40:58.888 --> 41:00.446
and don't forget to e-mail.

41:00.523 --> 41:01.547
I won't.

41:01.624 --> 41:03.592
And I'll come and visit you
as soon as I can.

41:03.693 --> 41:04.785
Okay.

41:05.261 --> 41:07.422
Our flight leaves in an hour.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.558
Could I just have a minute?

41:13.770 --> 41:15.738
I brought you something.

41:16.639 --> 41:18.106
An old watch?

41:18.508 --> 41:19.873
It's from...

41:22.111 --> 41:24.079
From your grandfather,

41:24.747 --> 41:26.715
who got it from his father,

41:26.816 --> 41:28.579
who got it from his.

41:30.386 --> 41:33.549
It's been passed down
for over 100 years,

41:36.526 --> 41:38.255
and now it's yours.

41:39.128 --> 41:40.857
I want you to keep it
on New York City time.

41:40.930 --> 41:43.228
That way, we're always in sync.

41:45.835 --> 41:47.325
We have to go.

41:51.674 --> 41:54.040
You don't have to
say it, daddy.

41:54.110 --> 41:55.270
I know.

41:58.147 --> 42:01.173
Come on and we'll try

42:01.251 --> 42:04.220
one last time

42:04.320 --> 42:06.788
I'm off of the floor
one more time to find you

42:06.856 --> 42:08.483
come on, sweetie.

42:09.859 --> 42:11.622
Come on and we'll sing

42:11.694 --> 42:12.922
jump in.

42:13.129 --> 42:16.360
Like we were free

42:16.432 --> 42:18.195
push the pedal down

42:18.268 --> 42:22.034
watch the world around fly by us

42:22.272 --> 42:25.173
come on and we'll try

42:25.441 --> 42:28.501
one last time

42:28.578 --> 42:30.546
I'm off of the floor

42:30.613 --> 42:33.946
one more time to find you

42:35.218 --> 42:36.776
and here we go

42:36.886 --> 42:40.049
there's nothing left to choose

42:41.691 --> 42:43.215
and here we go

42:43.738 --> 42:45.873
there's nothing left to lose
