00:10.227 --> 00:13.013
The countdown
to the New Year is on.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.406
Fire up those
grills and ice the Cristal,

00:15.406 --> 00:18.540
'cause it is time to party
this year out the door

00:18.540 --> 00:20.281
and welcome the new one
right in.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.934
I'm really excited.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.153
I think it's gonna be
a really good year.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.459
Of course, there's gonna be

00:24.459 --> 00:26.765
one big party downtown
as fireworks light up

00:26.765 --> 00:28.506
the night sky
over the Inner Harbor.

00:28.506 --> 00:29.855
And safety, once again,

00:29.855 --> 00:31.292
it's a top priority.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.424
All across the country,
police departments...

00:33.424 --> 00:34.860
Coming after
the stroke of midnight,

00:34.860 --> 00:36.384
we have quite a party in store.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.081
It's a relative calm
before the storm.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.952
I want to show you
what it looks like behind me.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.128
We've tested the confetti.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.433
We've tested the fireworks.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.653
Believe me,
you're not just gonna see them.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.090
You're gonna feel them--
in your chest.

01:07.850 --> 01:10.113
- Yeah!

01:20.689 --> 01:24.562
♪ Bring 'em all round,
we'll play cards ♪

01:24.562 --> 01:27.652
♪ Wondering if you'll
strike my heart ♪

01:27.652 --> 01:29.654
♪ We'll move to the floor

01:29.654 --> 01:31.439
- ♪ And I'll take my cue

01:31.439 --> 01:33.049
- ♪ But, baby
-  Do it! Do it!

01:33.049 --> 01:35.051
Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:35.051 --> 01:37.140
♪ I'm sick and tired
of playing your games ♪

01:37.140 --> 01:39.969
♪ It's too late,
I won't wait... ♪

01:45.279 --> 01:48.717
♪ It's too late, I won't wait

01:59.336 --> 02:02.948
♪ Doo, doo, doo-doo-doo

02:02.948 --> 02:06.256
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo-doo.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.701
Okay, so what's the problem?

02:16.701 --> 02:18.529
She's the problem.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.314
Okay? This woman is

02:20.314 --> 02:21.967
- distressing my customers,

02:21.967 --> 02:23.795
and she's refusing to leave.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.232
- Hey, that's it.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.755
You're done. Let's go.

02:26.755 --> 02:28.191
Don't touch me,
you little shit.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.324
- You hear that?
Hey, dude.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.673
You're the one
distressing the customers.

02:31.673 --> 02:32.978
The lady paid for her meal.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.458
She's entitled to finish it.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.720
It's New Year's, man.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.157
Yeah, I know it's New Year's.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.333
I'm working here, buddy.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.378
Great.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.687
Ma'am, you can't
bring alcohol in here.

02:45.687 --> 02:46.862
Try eating this food
without it.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.864
Thank you.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.474
Look, she clearly
has a problem.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.433
Why don't you let her
just finish and leave?

02:52.433 --> 02:56.088
Because she has been here
for three goddamn hours, okay?

02:56.088 --> 02:57.568
Hey, listen,
I'm not trying to be

02:57.568 --> 02:58.830
an asshole,
but I need that table.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.702
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.747
I need that table, and I want
her gone, so do your job.

03:02.747 --> 03:05.228
G25, Code 3.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.317
All units handling
noncritical tasks,

03:07.317 --> 03:09.232
report to Hopkins Plaza immediately.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.148
- I repeat: G25, Code 3.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.237
What's a G25?

03:17.240 --> 03:19.199
She stays.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.436
Active shooter.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.612
25 victims reported,
17 confirmed dead.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.880
We got reports of
a shooter down at the harbor.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.013
Any eyes? Please confirm.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.544
Sector 6,
ground control, come in.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.468
OFFICER 3 [over radio]:
305 West Fayette Street,

04:11.468 --> 04:12.904
apartment 9B.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.732
Dead teenage boy, Jonah Miller.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.473
CST needs the room clear
right away.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.635
WOMAN [sobbing]:
I can't watch you die.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.724
I can't watch you die.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.335
OFFICER [over radio]:
305 West Fayette, 1409.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.250
Can you confirm
victim deceased?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.774
Mrs. Miller, I'm gonna
need you to lay him down.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.689
I'm sorry,
I'm just doing my job.

04:58.689 --> 05:02.911
Your job was to keep him alive.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.523
OFFICER [over speaker]:
All residents,

05:06.523 --> 05:08.525
- switch off your lights.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.527
Stay away from the windows.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.529
Do not leave your building.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.270
This is not a drill.

05:14.270 --> 05:17.882
All residents,
switch off your lights.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.406
Hi.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.842
My name's Eleanor.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.931
- What's yours?
- Haley.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.064
Mrs. Miller?

05:26.064 --> 05:28.371
Your daughter needs you. Now.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.895
Please let me take both of you
to your room.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.550
Single bullet through

05:33.550 --> 05:35.378
north-facing window
punctured the victim's head,

05:35.378 --> 05:37.815
then hit the wall
at a downward trajectory of...

05:41.341 --> 05:43.038
...23 degrees.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.562
OFFICER [over radio]:
Stand by. All units ready?

05:45.562 --> 05:47.129
Do you want to go blind?

05:55.877 --> 05:57.792
OFFICER [over radio]:
Rooftop sniper, stand by.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.272
Any more shots, let me know
if our guy's on the move.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.547
OFFICER [over radio]:
Okay, okay. We've got it.

06:13.547 --> 06:16.376
12 Redwood Street, 17th floor.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.642
Jesus fuck.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.558
This is Heli 2,
heading to Redwood.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.125
Clear all civilian craft.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.621
Everybody, get out! Get out!

06:44.621 --> 06:46.406
Remove yourself from
the building! This way!

06:46.406 --> 06:49.496
- Yes, that's correct.
Hey! Stop!

06:49.496 --> 06:51.889
- Do not leave the forecourt.
- What, are you insane?

06:51.889 --> 06:53.761
The place is on fire.
Get 'em out!

06:53.761 --> 06:55.545
What if one of them
is the shooter?

06:55.545 --> 06:57.286
What if he's got
the whole place rigged to blow?

06:57.286 --> 06:58.461
Get 'em out now!

07:01.725 --> 07:03.335
Start recording.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.859
- What?
- Get every face on video.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.513
Record. Every face.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.515
Get 'em on your phone.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.237
Let's go! Let's go!

07:35.237 --> 07:37.195
Move in!

07:37.195 --> 07:39.502
Out! Out of the building now!

07:39.502 --> 07:40.808
Go, go!

07:43.114 --> 07:44.681
Keep filming.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.952
- Move it, move it, move it!

07:58.347 --> 08:00.523
I got light! I got light!

08:04.919 --> 08:07.791
- Come on, honey.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.633
Through the door,
top of the stairs.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.289
Clear!

09:11.289 --> 09:13.291
All clear!

09:15.816 --> 09:17.818
This apartment's clear!

09:22.126 --> 09:24.607
Nobody died here.
Not even a finger.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.136
That's it.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.746
You're okay.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.487
Yeah, you're all right?

10:19.923 --> 10:22.186
Hold this for me. Here!

10:25.407 --> 10:27.104
Hey.
- Hey.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.715
She's all right.
She just fainted.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.978
Okay. -Sometimes I do
have that effect.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.285
I'm gonna swap
your mask, all right?

10:40.727 --> 10:42.250
I'm good. Thank you.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.687
I'm sorry.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.123
How long was I out?

10:46.123 --> 10:47.951
- Whoop!
- Oh, oh, hold...

10:47.951 --> 10:49.649
I'm okay. -You're not going
down 17 flights of stairs.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.651
- Let's get her away.
- Yep.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.306
Okay. Put her down.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.091
Okay, good.
Good, good, good, good.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.833
- Easy.
- All right, follow my finger.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.662
That's it.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.795
Okay. Good.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.015
Three full sweeps, sir.
Not a sign.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.278
Parking lot,
storage units, elevators.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.584
Yeah, we all know what a
building is made of, Commander.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.630
Stop thinking,
"Where haven't I looked?"

11:14.630 --> 11:16.110
- Hey.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.459
Start thinking,
"Where would I hide?"

11:18.460 --> 11:19.896
Give me your arm.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.985
Mac.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.770
- What you got?
- The owner's Norwegian.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.119
- Financial advisor.
- Uh-huh.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.642
He's in Oslo as we speak.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.078
Says he never laid eyes
on the condo.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.689
He got it as a debt repayment.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.994
He's been trying
to sell it ever since.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.474
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.606
- Oh, shit! Fuck!

11:36.565 --> 11:38.219
MAN [over radio]: Sorry, guys.
Those were preprogrammed.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.829
We're getting the others
shut off.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.137
Ah, fuck.

11:43.137 --> 11:44.747
MAN [over radio]: Confirming
those were preprogrammed.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.706
Make sure
you turn them all off.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.013
I seriously...
I thought we were getting shot.

12:02.199 --> 12:05.072
Guys, we should get
that toilet right now.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.164
Before it gets contaminated
any further.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.737
No, guys. All of it.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.173
The whole thing-- pull it out.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.045
Keep breathing,
all right? -Excuse me.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.613
- Through your nose.
Ma'am.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.529
Does this place look
like an ER to you?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.444
Right.
No.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.011
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.360
- Don't worry about it.
- Just-just leave me.

12:35.102 --> 12:38.018
The explosion--
was it triggered remotely?

12:52.467 --> 12:54.077
It's intact.

12:54.077 --> 12:57.472
Whoever's inside
had a copy of the key.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.561
We're holding
the residents in base camp.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.563
At least the ones
we managed to hold on to.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.870
My first responders
got the others on tape.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.741
Good thinking. What about
searching the condos?

13:05.741 --> 13:07.003
I could bring federal warrants.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.222
I heard.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.180
17 flights and no gas mask?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.356
You're wasting precious
medical time here, Falco.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.663
In the middle of
a citywide medical emergency.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.534
It won't happen again, sir.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.667
Forget about the warrants.
We'll just ask permission.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.235
Anyone gets antsy,
they're the ones we want.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.724
All right, people, listen up.

13:32.724 --> 13:35.162
We're being joined
by Special Agent Lammark

13:35.162 --> 13:37.207
from the Bureau's
regional field office.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.992
The FBI is gonna be
assisting us

13:38.992 --> 13:40.820
with this investigation.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.691
Thank you.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.868
Okay, within
the next few hours,

13:45.868 --> 13:50.090
your desks are gonna be
flooded with data,

13:50.090 --> 13:53.180
much of it inevitably false.

13:53.180 --> 13:57.184
You're also gonna hear
a lot of opinions.

13:57.184 --> 14:00.100
But opinions
never caught anyone,

14:00.100 --> 14:04.191
so it's important to keep
certain preconceptions in mind

14:04.191 --> 14:06.802
while classifying evidence.

14:06.802 --> 14:11.372
"Mass murderers
want to get caught."

14:11.372 --> 14:13.940
Well, this one doesn't.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.376
29 victims.

14:15.376 --> 14:18.901
Every shot found its mark.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.383
No casings, no brass.

14:22.383 --> 14:26.604
Not a single stray hair
or fingerprint.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.258
This guy is thorough.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.260
He didn't come here to die,

14:30.260 --> 14:33.263
and he does not want
to be found.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.267
We're gonna disappoint him.

14:43.534 --> 14:49.192
You will hear this man
called a terrorist.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.368
But any terrorist organization

14:51.368 --> 14:53.370
that could've
pulled that off...

14:54.589 --> 14:56.634
...they would rush
to claim credit for it.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.375
So far, none have.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.294
You will hear this man
called a maniac.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.210
Shit, I agree.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.561
Except the range
of personality disorders

15:10.561 --> 15:14.739
is so extensive that
it includes all of us here.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.177
Depression, anxiety,

15:17.177 --> 15:19.179
uh, schizophrenia.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.442
- But...

15:22.443 --> 15:26.403
PPD, NPD,

15:26.403 --> 15:28.536
PTSD.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.321
We took every crazy
off the street,

15:31.321 --> 15:34.020
there would be no one left
to police them.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.674
- So...

15:36.674 --> 15:41.505
to succeed, we're gonna
have to keep our minds open.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.725
Don't start out

15:43.725 --> 15:47.468
picturing a racist or a Nazi.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.991
He's not a type.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.559
He's a person.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.169
Somebody loved him.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.824
Somebody trained him.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.957
Somebody sold him that gun.

15:59.219 --> 16:02.091
We find them...

16:02.091 --> 16:04.659
we find our guy.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.400
Four...

16:06.400 --> 16:07.923
The governor's given you

16:07.923 --> 16:09.185
all the resources
he can give you.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.317
There's nothing more I can do.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.883
I'm a federal agent.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.016
Highways are not
federal. I'm sorry.
- Ah.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.887
Shutting them down
would only cause mass panic.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.455
No, the shooter
causes mass panic.

16:18.455 --> 16:21.458
Shutting down a highway
causes headaches.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.460
Headaches my governor
doesn't need right now.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.506
REPORTER [over TV]: In shock,
the mayor has called for calm.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.203
If you see anyone suspicious...

16:27.203 --> 16:29.466
"It's not a type.
It's a person."

16:29.466 --> 16:31.642
What a hack.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.427
No wonder
they kicked him out of D.C.

16:33.427 --> 16:36.430
These people,
they're just born plain evil.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.520
Evil is cutting off a bird's
wing just to see what happens.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.826
This guy is
swatting mosquitoes.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.394
Whatever. We should
string him up by his balls

16:44.394 --> 16:46.135
from the top of a flagpole.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.963
That'll deter all the other
nutsos out there.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.660
Officer.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.358
Why don't you leave
the sentencing to the judge.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.577
Our job right now
is to catch him.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.494
- Sorry, sir.
- Oh, it's okay.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.105
Nice to know
how I'll be remembered.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.150
Any chance of
some fresh coffee?

17:01.150 --> 17:03.544
This tastes like
transmission fluid.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.459
Right away.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.113
Mm, I'll do it.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.592
It's okay.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.072
Excuse me.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.994
Why'd you say that thing
about mosquitoes?

17:22.519 --> 17:25.131
- Oh, it was just a feeling.
- Based on what?

17:26.784 --> 17:29.483
I don't think this guy
is looking for destruction.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.789
I think
he's looking for relief.

17:31.789 --> 17:35.576
And do you have a feeling
that he's gonna do it again?

17:36.664 --> 17:37.795
Yes.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.667
Why?

17:39.667 --> 17:41.277
Because he liked it.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.236
How do you know?

17:44.237 --> 17:46.108
He killed 29 people.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.458
Otherwise, he would've
stopped at two.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.286
Well, why did he stop
shooting at all?

17:50.286 --> 17:53.811
I mean, why not kill 50? 60?

17:53.811 --> 17:56.118
Was it because
the fireworks stopped

17:56.118 --> 17:59.339
and so there was no more cover
for the gunshots?

17:59.339 --> 18:01.167
- Yeah, maybe.
- Bullshit.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.517
Don't patronize me.
Tell me what you think.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.782
I think he got his fill.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.436
No matter how good
the food tastes,

18:09.436 --> 18:11.699
you stop eating
when you've had enough.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.355
Till you get hungry again.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.140
What's your name?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.142
Eleanor Falco, sir.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.057
Lammark.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.540
WOMAN [on TV]: The number of
deaths by firearms in this...

18:26.540 --> 18:28.411
MAN [on TV]: Maybe because
we leveled Iraq on a lie?

18:28.411 --> 18:30.326
There's no
Second Amendment in China.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.198
Now you're
justifying mass murder?

18:32.198 --> 18:34.113
No, I'm trying
to understand it.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.984
There's no
moral ambiguity about it.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.029
The rate of death
by either suicide or homi...

18:38.029 --> 18:39.596
...construct
elaborate narratives

18:39.596 --> 18:41.598
in which they get
to be the hero.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.966
Hey.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.237
WOMAN [on TV]:
Pseudocommandos are terrorists

19:11.237 --> 19:12.890
without a known cause.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.197
They become obsessed
with weapons and regalia

19:15.197 --> 19:18.157
to make up for their own sense
of impotence and failure.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.028
MAN [on TV]: They're often
victims of aggression

19:20.028 --> 19:21.595
during childhood
and development,

19:21.595 --> 19:23.249
especially from the people

19:23.249 --> 19:25.251
who are supposed to love
and protect them.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.222
Sir?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.962
Any trouble
with Lammark, Falco?

20:24.962 --> 20:26.050
Trouble?

20:26.050 --> 20:27.487
Meet him at Lindenblatt's
at 6:00.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.184
He wants to see you.
Didn't say why.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.664
Fuck.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.412
We are exposing
more people to more risk.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.848
It's out of the question.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.023
You can forget about it.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.068
Jesse, haven't you seen "Jaws"?

20:44.068 --> 20:45.679
Right now, you're the asshole

20:45.679 --> 20:47.811
that's trying to keep
the beach open.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.073
29 bodies.

20:49.073 --> 20:50.553
Well, they had 58 in Vegas.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.294
Next day, you had Celine Dion--

20:52.294 --> 20:54.035
she's onstage, Caesars Palace.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.906
- The show's got to go on.
- Hello.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.908
That guy was dead.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.781
We have an Olympic-class
marksman running wild.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.174
The governor
is not closing hospitals,

21:03.174 --> 21:05.264
- is not closing down schools.
Fine. Of course.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.353
Those we can deal with,
but theme parks,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.180
malls, stadiums?

21:09.180 --> 21:11.095
Yeah, well, we're not gonna
impose a curfew

21:11.095 --> 21:12.880
without a single clue.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.360
What's the strategy?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.231
"Until Lammark finds him"?

21:16.231 --> 21:18.059
By now, the guy could be
in Minnesota.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.756
- They're not closing Minnesota.
- Oh.

21:19.756 --> 21:22.672
9/11, New York City--
they didn't shut it down.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.892
-Look, if you can't
deliver what you promised

21:24.892 --> 21:26.894
without shutting down
the whole damn city,

21:26.894 --> 21:28.548
- forget about it.
- Jesse.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.289
Calm down.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.769
I can find him.

21:32.769 --> 21:36.077
What I need to know
is that you're onside.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.298
I got to go.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.128
Mayor was still mayor
in the sequel.

21:44.128 --> 21:46.087
That's the lesson from "Jaws."

21:46.087 --> 21:48.219
- Let's revert later today.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.396
I don't even know
what that means.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.752
Jesus fuck.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.406
Sir.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.364
Um...

22:02.364 --> 22:03.887
is this a good time?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.933
No, please. Please, go ahead.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.240
These fucking people.

22:12.983 --> 22:15.638
It's almost as though
they designed a system

22:15.638 --> 22:18.424
specifically to drain
my energy away.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.730
I don't get it. Don't they
want you to catch him?

22:20.730 --> 22:22.471
Oh, yeah. By yesterday.

22:22.471 --> 22:24.560
The problem is that
they think they know how.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.562
Anyway, let's talk about you.

22:26.562 --> 22:27.955
Coffee?

22:29.043 --> 22:30.740
Sure.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.221
I can think of two reasons

22:33.221 --> 22:35.441
why you might be getting
a good read on this guy.

22:35.441 --> 22:39.009
You're potentially
a good detective.

22:39.009 --> 22:42.404
You're as fucked-up
in the head as he is.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.233
Either way,
I'm doing everyone a favor

22:45.233 --> 22:47.583
by keeping you off the streets.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.845
Oh.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.500
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.197
Look at you, buddy.
What's got you so slim?

22:53.197 --> 22:54.851
Cut out gluten.
It's a magic bullet.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.418
- That gluten, huh?
- Yeah.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.464
- Steak and eggs got gluten?
- No.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.640
I believe you've met
Jack McKenzie?

23:00.640 --> 23:02.990
- As an investigator, frankly,

23:02.990 --> 23:04.948
he's average at best.

23:04.948 --> 23:09.431
But when we get close
to that killer,

23:09.431 --> 23:12.782
trust me,
we all want Mac around.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.698
- Flattered.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.700
She staying?

23:17.700 --> 23:19.789
I'd have to ask
for your transfer.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.835
I'd be working for the Bureau?

23:21.835 --> 23:25.969
No, you'd be a liaison
between BPD and me, basically,

23:25.969 --> 23:27.884
making sure that I get
the information I need

23:27.884 --> 23:29.451
when I need it.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.018
I'm surrounded
by jackals and clowns.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.846
Krupp and Marquand are capable,

23:32.846 --> 23:34.674
but they're gonna feed
everything back to D.C.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.153
I just need people around me

23:36.153 --> 23:37.938
that are smart
and that I can trust.

23:37.938 --> 23:41.376
Right now, believe it or not,
that's you two.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.292
So don't fuck it up.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.126
Be an artist, not a cop.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.649
Use your intuition.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.782
This guy's on
a spiral of destruction.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.523
I expect you
to slide down after him.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.307
I'm here to catch you.
You know that.

23:59.307 --> 24:01.483
You stay away from this girl.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.138
Thank you, sir,
but I can protect myself.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.966
Oh, I'm worried about him.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.838
Okay, people.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.753
Let's go catch him.

24:10.753 --> 24:12.451
The block has
12 security cameras,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.540
but the drive overwrites
every 72 hours.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.498
Our guy got in before that,
we missed him.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.369
There are also
significant blind spots,

24:18.369 --> 24:19.588
including the service bay

24:19.588 --> 24:21.285
and the second-floor
hallway window.

24:21.285 --> 24:22.722
Now, Samantha's collating
all the incident AV:

24:22.722 --> 24:24.724
cell phones,
drone surveillance.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.508
It's about 300 hours
of footage.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.988
We should have it cleaned up

24:27.988 --> 24:30.164
and cut down in sequence
by 1:00 p.m.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.731
Can I see a rough cut at 11:00?

24:31.731 --> 24:33.559
Absolutely.
The Realtor's checking through

24:33.559 --> 24:35.430
all of the walk-throughs
over the last six months.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.301
He and his team will be
available for questioning

24:37.301 --> 24:39.086
first thing tomorrow morning.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.783
Okay, painters, locksmith,
phone company.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.524
- Come on.
- No landline,
no cable, no Wi-Fi.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.352
No one lived there.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.528
The owner had the place painted
before the pandemic.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.225
We found the company.
We're tracing the men.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.620
Um, Eleanor?

24:51.620 --> 24:53.970
Uh, you-you're gonna get copies
of all these reports, okay?

24:53.970 --> 24:55.363
Yeah, all right.

24:56.364 --> 24:58.279
Um... please.

24:58.279 --> 25:00.629
Señor Ortega has been a janitor

25:00.629 --> 25:02.326
at this building
since it opened.

25:02.326 --> 25:05.025
He's 54, Cuban, GPR negative.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.330
There's no guns, no record.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.636
He claims he's never had a copy

25:07.636 --> 25:09.159
- of the keys.
Right.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.683
There's another janitor

25:10.683 --> 25:12.293
named Barraza,
works the night shift.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.034
He was off on holiday,
so he's unreachable.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.383
Where is Barraza?

25:15.383 --> 25:16.993
He's not in the area.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.691
I didn't ask where he isn't.
I asked where he is.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.127
Doesn't fit our profile.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.824
He's friendly, funny.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.130
Half of the residents
accused him

25:23.130 --> 25:24.697
of smoking weed in the hallway.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.568
- What about the other half?
- They're buying it from him.

25:26.568 --> 25:29.049
- Lot of laughter. Krupp?

25:29.049 --> 25:30.833
We've I.D.'d
the building's residents

25:30.833 --> 25:32.400
- and instigated
background checks.
- Mm-hmm.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.793
Counterterrorism are processing
the profiles right now.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.185
Counterterrorism?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.797
Frank Graber requested them.

25:38.841 --> 25:41.104
I run the operation.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.802
Not Frank Graber.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.979
Not D.C. Certainly not you.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.371
They have twice our resources.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.547
I thought you'd be on board.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.591
I'm just trying
to speed things along.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.028
I'll speed your ass
out the door.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.248
If Frank Graber
requests resuscitation,

25:54.248 --> 25:56.076
you need my approval first.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.686
Okay?

25:57.686 --> 25:59.383
- That goes for everyone.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.605
What is it now?

26:04.737 --> 26:06.608
Confirmation that you are not

26:06.608 --> 26:08.044
requesting a curfew.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.568
Jesse Capleton
asked you to sign.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.352
Why would I sign something

26:11.352 --> 26:14.268
that's the exact opposite
of what I asked for?

26:14.268 --> 26:16.575
He said you agreed to
in the meeting,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.360
- and now he needs you
on the record.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.756
Fucking asshole.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.195
Okay. Marquand?

26:28.195 --> 26:30.240
Yes, sir.
Be straight with me.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.720
Have you been talking
to counterterrorism?

26:31.720 --> 26:32.939
No, sir.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.114
Is it gonna stay that way?

26:34.114 --> 26:35.724
Yes, sir.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.987
Then what you got?

26:37.987 --> 26:39.380
Well, the shockwave analysis confirmed

26:39.380 --> 26:40.729
the use of a hand grenade.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.252
It's an M14.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.385
He turned on the gas,
pulled the pin,

26:44.385 --> 26:46.474
- walked out, and he closed
the door behind him.
- Mm-hmm.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.476
There's also a lot of scratches
under the lock.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.565
Like he had
a big bunch of keys.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.481
Now, ballistics has their money
set on an XM21 sniper system.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.179
Used in Vietnam,
right up to Desert Storm.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.181
They updated the scope in '75,

26:58.181 --> 27:00.836
but we think
it's one of the originals.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.752
If that's the case, we, uh...
we got a problem.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.275
What's that?

27:05.275 --> 27:06.973
The gun is older
than the database.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.496
That means we're gonna
have to go old-school,

27:08.496 --> 27:10.063
match each piece of evidence manually

27:10.063 --> 27:12.805
with military archives
state by state.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.981
- It's a fart in a hurricane.
- That's very poetic.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.983
That's what my wife says.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.506
What does the Army do
with weapons

27:18.506 --> 27:20.160
that are no longer in use?

27:20.160 --> 27:21.814
If they're in decent condition,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.467
they get kicked down
to local law enforcement.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.078
Some get dismantled,
others get redistributed

27:25.078 --> 27:26.557
to armed allied forces
around the world.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.777
Who dismantles them?

27:28.777 --> 27:31.258
Uh, the arsenal keepers.
Every base unit has one.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.002
But who actually verifies
that they're destroyed?

27:36.002 --> 27:38.874
You know what?
Get the keeper records.

27:38.874 --> 27:42.138
Active duty, prosecutions,
missing weapons,

27:42.138 --> 27:44.706
- psych trauma, PTSD.
We're on it.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.621
We can all use more help, Nathan,

27:46.621 --> 27:49.929
but I need collaboration,
not competition.

27:49.929 --> 27:51.974
There has to be
a clear chain of command.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.933
Personal question?

27:53.933 --> 27:56.022
Don't you think
Lammark's a bit paranoid

27:56.022 --> 27:57.719
about other teams
being involved?

27:57.719 --> 28:00.113
Not really.
Everyone's looking for credit.

28:00.113 --> 28:03.551
I've seen way too many cases
derail from friendly fire.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.396
My God.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.232
Tell me you got something here.

28:34.495 --> 28:38.107
Height, weight, anything.

28:38.107 --> 28:41.545
That distance-- I can't even
start to speculate.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.244
Small entrance,
large exit on all.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.767
One shot per victim.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.552
Head, chest, neck-- gone.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.775
- All yours, my friend.
- Yeah.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.430
You ever seen anything
like this, Mac?

28:56.430 --> 28:58.606
Not outside the Army.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.303
Very few inside.

29:00.303 --> 29:03.263
I mean, you got wind,
fireworks distracting you.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.830
It's flawless.

29:06.092 --> 29:09.182
Someone knows
how good this guy is.

29:09.182 --> 29:12.751
Military-trained
or high-level sports.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.102
Either way,

29:16.102 --> 29:18.408
this is winning medals.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.671
Is the shooter a man?

29:20.671 --> 29:22.412
Yes.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.327
Why?

29:25.328 --> 29:27.026
At this scale?

29:27.026 --> 29:29.071
Unprecedented.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.986
Planned or spontaneous?

29:30.986 --> 29:33.728
Planned.
Spontaneous.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.600
Then why did he have a weapon?

29:38.211 --> 29:40.169
He was trespassing.

29:40.169 --> 29:42.824
Maybe he was expecting
the police.

29:42.824 --> 29:45.522
With a 40-year-old
sniper rifle?

29:47.133 --> 29:50.484
Different genders,
different races.

29:50.484 --> 29:54.836
Some old, some quite young.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.707
There's no pattern.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.623
Why?

29:59.623 --> 30:02.844
Well, we can speculate

30:02.844 --> 30:05.368
that nature's not to blame.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.370
Culture is.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.677
We're all different.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.853
We still act the same.

30:11.853 --> 30:14.856
Rush hour, lunch hour,

30:14.856 --> 30:17.641
Black Friday, New Year's Eve.

30:18.686 --> 30:22.385
We just blindly follow
the same patterns.

30:22.385 --> 30:25.388
He's not punishing people.

30:25.388 --> 30:28.043
He's disrupting behavior.

30:28.043 --> 30:31.917
There's no torture,
no reveling in the suffering.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.834
Just a-- poof--
quick one-way ticket to Narnia.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.054
Sir.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.795
They have him.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.015
What do you mean,
"They have him"? Who has him?

31:00.641 --> 31:02.208
Frank?

31:04.906 --> 31:06.473
I'm heading this up
till Nathan says otherwise.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.083
Hey, don't have a heart attack.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.737
I'm not here to undermine you.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.173
- We just have to move fast.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.610
We're checking up
the residents,

31:13.610 --> 31:15.830
and this kid rings alarm bells
all over the place.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.528
We try to question him,
he locks himself in his room

31:18.528 --> 31:21.923
and threatens to kill everyone,
which is never a good sign.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.403
OFFICER [over radio]:
Alpha Team, into position.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.318
Beta Team, clear the floor.

31:25.318 --> 31:26.928
OFFICER 2 [over radio]:
Do we have eyes on the weapon?

31:26.928 --> 31:30.018
Repeat,
is the weapon confirmed?

31:30.018 --> 31:32.760
It was nice of you to invite
everyone before calling me!

31:35.197 --> 31:37.417
He ticks every box: ADHD,

31:37.417 --> 31:39.288
skips school
because he gets bullied,

31:39.288 --> 31:41.247
spends all night
watching ISIS clips

31:41.247 --> 31:43.379
and blowing out brains
on video games.

31:43.379 --> 31:46.687
And his uncle Aziz took him
to the gun club last summer.

31:46.687 --> 31:48.341
This is where the tenants

31:48.341 --> 31:52.084
of 12 Redwood Street
are staying on your dime.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.651
Now it seems the killer
is among them.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.436
How'd he access the apartment?

31:56.436 --> 31:58.220
The Rahmanis--
they live above it.

31:58.220 --> 32:00.396
He could've climbed to
the ledge. He knows the area.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.181
Probably planned out
this whole thing.

32:02.181 --> 32:03.312
SWAT COMMANDER [over radio]:
Ready to go. 20 seconds.

32:03.312 --> 32:04.792
Copy that.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.238
Alpha Team, we're going in.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.242
Do we know for certain
that he's armed?

32:20.242 --> 32:22.853
He said he was gonna
kill everyone!

32:22.853 --> 32:25.552
I asked whether he was armed,
not what he said!

32:25.552 --> 32:27.597
There was a mattress
in that condo.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.643
Why would there be one
if he lived upstairs?

32:29.643 --> 32:31.993
Who is this?
Why is she even here?

32:31.993 --> 32:33.995
It's okay, Eleanor.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.955
SWAT COMMANDER [over radio]:
In three, two, one.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.957
Go, go, go!

32:38.957 --> 32:40.088
Did you give the go-ahead?

32:40.088 --> 32:41.785
Back off, Lammark!

32:43.787 --> 32:45.180
- Get down on the floor!
- Get down!

32:45.180 --> 32:46.616
Where's the weapon?

32:46.616 --> 32:48.401
Stay the fuck
right where you are!

32:48.401 --> 32:49.924
- I didn't do anything!
- What the fuck are you doing?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.189
Get a life mat.

32:54.189 --> 32:55.712
He's going for the window!

32:55.712 --> 32:57.323
He's going for
the fucking window!

32:57.323 --> 32:59.890
- Get a life mat!

33:07.463 --> 33:10.901
Your tax dollars are
paying for their room service.

33:10.901 --> 33:14.035
Now it seems the killer
has been among them all along.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.482
Where's the weapon, Frank?

33:28.310 --> 33:30.486
So far, you haven't found
a catapult.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.185
He could've stashed it anywhere.

33:33.185 --> 33:36.884
You don't have a firearm.

33:36.884 --> 33:42.411
You're oceans away from
establishing any connection

33:42.411 --> 33:46.981
to an old XM21 rifle
in particular.

33:46.981 --> 33:51.116
You don't get to become
a first-class marksman

33:51.116 --> 33:53.335
playing video games.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.469
So, you either find
some evidence here,

33:56.469 --> 33:58.123
make some sense of it,

33:58.123 --> 34:01.474
or admit that this has been

34:01.474 --> 34:05.217
a colossal fuckup!

34:05.217 --> 34:06.827
Come on, Lammark.

34:06.827 --> 34:09.264
If it wasn't him,
how come he jumped?

34:09.264 --> 34:12.050
I don't know, maybe it's
'cause of that fucking parasite

34:12.050 --> 34:14.748
Jimmy Kittridge calling him
a terrorist on live TV.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.576
Arab kid,
Baltimore high school.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.143
Do you think
he pictured himself

34:18.143 --> 34:20.014
becoming homecoming king
after that?

34:20.014 --> 34:22.799
Okay, but for now,
it could've been him, right?

34:22.799 --> 34:24.627
I mean, until
he's proven innocent?

34:24.627 --> 34:26.934
Jesse, it's supposed to be
the other way around.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.936
Not when we're competing
with six other states

34:28.936 --> 34:31.634
for a $9 billion gas plant.

34:31.634 --> 34:34.594
I need the people out there
to feel safe, Lammark.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.379
This shows them we're on it.
It buys us more time.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.079
Are you gonna tell that shit
to the Rahmanis?

34:41.079 --> 34:42.906
Go ahead, tell 'em that,

34:42.906 --> 34:45.692
'cause I got
fucking work to do.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.089
Three painters worked
the apartment.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.786
We've got Rodney Lang,

34:52.786 --> 34:55.484
Abraham Haynes
and Dimitri Bovrov.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.709
Mr. Lang, this should be quick.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.277
I hope you don't mind.
Uh, I brought backup.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.976
Wife's working a double, so...

35:08.976 --> 35:10.934
guess who's in charge
of little Desmond here.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.327
Desmond, huh?

35:12.327 --> 35:14.460
Had an uncle called Desmond.

35:14.460 --> 35:18.594
Used to write erotic novels
under the, uh, name

35:18.594 --> 35:20.901
"Melody Bangs."

35:20.901 --> 35:23.686
Okay. -I suppose you remember
where you were last night?

35:23.686 --> 35:26.602
Uh, yeah. Actually, we...

35:26.602 --> 35:28.604
went down to the harbor
to watch the fireworks.

35:28.604 --> 35:30.432
We were there. Scary shit.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.176
You got... you got proof?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.656
- Proof?
- Mm-hmm.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.658
We got proof, yeah.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.399
Like a million selfies.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.183
ABRAHAM [voice-over]:
At my mother-in-law's.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.620
I thought you caught the guy.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.275
Maybe. No pictures?

35:47.275 --> 35:49.016
Mm...

35:49.016 --> 35:50.670
ABRAHAM [voice-over]:
Of my mother-in-law?

35:50.670 --> 35:52.672
Lots of pictures.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.587
Big party. Cousins, nephews.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.288
What am I doing here?
Am I a suspect?

36:01.898 --> 36:03.378
I just stripped
the fucking place.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.945
Two years ago.

36:04.945 --> 36:05.859
Hey, hey, hey. calm down.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.556
It's all good.

36:07.556 --> 36:09.123
Just asking you questions.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.432
I was at my apartment alone.

36:13.432 --> 36:15.390
Relax, Dimitri.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.262
It's still legal to spend
a night alone in this country.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.133
- Can you prove it?

36:19.133 --> 36:23.485
My, uh, neighbor,
maybe he see me come in?

36:23.485 --> 36:25.879
And, uh,
I call my father in Russia.

36:25.879 --> 36:28.098
Perhaps you can verify
with phone company?

36:28.098 --> 36:29.796
But you did get some...

36:29.796 --> 36:32.973
some military training
in Russia, right?

36:32.973 --> 36:35.715
Did you get
any shooting practice?

36:35.715 --> 36:37.891
Sir, I did not kill
those people.

36:40.589 --> 36:44.289
I find it shameful that I need
to explain this to you.

36:44.289 --> 36:45.812
I'm an honest man,

36:45.812 --> 36:47.466
and I work hard
for what I have.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.251
Yes, I did shooting practice--
two weeks.

36:50.251 --> 36:53.863
Then I break my arm,
so no good for shooting.

36:53.863 --> 36:57.954
They tell me to go
clean barracks, so I sweep,

36:57.954 --> 37:01.567
I wash windows, and that is
how I serve my country.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.917
Mr. Haynes,
why did you stop working

37:03.917 --> 37:06.093
at DeLuxe Painting and Repairs?

37:06.093 --> 37:07.964
Maybe I wasn't fast enough.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.097
You'd have to ask them.

37:10.097 --> 37:13.535
So, you...
you stripped the place.

37:13.535 --> 37:15.581
- Alone.
- Yes.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.106
What else do you remember?

37:19.106 --> 37:20.977
That light.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.588
The view.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.416
We worked the lounge together.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.983
Then Dimitri stayed extra
for the bedrooms.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.724
I think.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.291
No, I did the bedrooms.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.424
- I'm sure.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.950
Eleanor, would you
consider it sexist of me

37:36.950 --> 37:39.996
if I asked you
to take little Desmond here

37:39.996 --> 37:41.824
and put him to sleep?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.570
Oh. Thanks, sweetie.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.060
Mr. Lang, you've got
quite the, uh...

38:00.060 --> 38:01.583
the gig
in wall painting, right?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.237
You're a regular at DeLuxe.

38:03.237 --> 38:05.805
A string of work
for Ultraviolet as well?

38:05.805 --> 38:08.286
Well, uh,
kids don't come cheap.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.339
Hi. Excuse me.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.471
Preliminary lab report.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.864
- Oh.
- Mind signing it for me?

39:04.864 --> 39:06.996
- Okay. Sure.
- Thanks.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.871
Awesome. Thank you.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.794
No, guys, please. Guys!

39:21.794 --> 39:24.405
Do you want an investigation,

39:24.405 --> 39:27.060
or do you want
an entertainment event?

39:33.327 --> 39:34.894
Hey, Eleanor.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.635
Did you receive
a package from the lab?

39:36.635 --> 39:37.897
Yes, sir.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.986
I've included it in my report.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.857
The urine and fecal samples
were scarce,

39:41.857 --> 39:43.990
but there was still enough
to detect an iron deficiency.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.513
I looked it up, and it's common

39:45.513 --> 39:47.515
amongst people
who don't eat meat.

39:47.515 --> 39:49.778
What time did it arrive?

39:49.778 --> 39:52.085
- I don't know, 20 minutes ago?
- 45.

39:53.129 --> 39:55.915
I didn't have it,
so, uh, I rang the lab.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.917
- Checked with the courier.
- I'm sorry, sir.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.920
I was just trying to help.
You were on the phone, and...

40:00.920 --> 40:04.402
This is specialized, urgent,

40:04.402 --> 40:07.187
classified intel.

40:09.581 --> 40:13.149
You are the BPD liaison,
a beat cop,

40:13.149 --> 40:15.674
no college degree,
but you decide

40:15.674 --> 40:18.677
that I should wait
for your verdict.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.533
Eleanor, I'm sorry I snapped.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.492
I had a ridiculously stressful
phone conversation.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.929
- I took it out on you.
- No worries.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.627
Hey, I know it's late,

40:55.627 --> 40:57.629
but I have, uh,
some new stuff to go over,

40:57.629 --> 41:00.109
and I could use
some of your brain.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.807
Want to come have some dinner,

41:01.807 --> 41:04.331
talk it through
with a good glass of wine?

41:06.246 --> 41:09.902
Sir, if you hired me
so you could fuck me,

41:09.902 --> 41:12.731
you can take this job and
you can shove it up your ass.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.081
Eleanor, I'm married.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.518
Come and have dinner with us.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.912
You look like you could use
a good meal.

41:27.397 --> 41:30.183
You also think
it's gonna happen again.

41:30.183 --> 41:32.272
Why did you sign that memo?

41:32.272 --> 41:34.317
You can't fight every battle.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.145
Have to choose
the ones you can win.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.931
Yeah, but when you sign,
you're a part of the game.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.803
And when you don't,
they replace you.

41:41.803 --> 41:43.544
The only decision you're making

41:43.544 --> 41:46.199
is whether
to be buried or burned.

41:55.556 --> 41:57.558
Jesse Capleton can't fire you.

41:57.558 --> 41:59.778
He's not your boss.

41:59.778 --> 42:02.128
Jesse Capleton
operates my boss,

42:02.128 --> 42:04.565
who operates him in return.

42:04.565 --> 42:08.874
Guys like that,
it's a circle jerk.

42:08.874 --> 42:11.441
All it takes is one call.

42:11.441 --> 42:14.009
"Don't you think Lammark's
a little off his game?"

42:14.009 --> 42:16.751
"Well, there is
no bigger fan than me,

42:16.751 --> 42:20.276
but we do have to think
of his heart."

42:20.276 --> 42:23.323
They each say what
the other one wants to hear.

42:23.323 --> 42:24.933
Before you know it,

42:24.933 --> 42:27.370
you're packing your desk
into a box.

42:28.633 --> 42:31.244
- Humble opinion?
- Mm-hmm?

42:31.244 --> 42:34.813
It's not 'cause they're scared
you won't catch him.

42:34.813 --> 42:36.945
It's 'cause
they're scared you will.

42:36.945 --> 42:39.034
You crack this,
you get the spotlight.

42:39.034 --> 42:40.819
Some people just can't stand
the shadows.

42:45.998 --> 42:48.087
There's something odd
about Lang.

42:49.915 --> 42:53.353
The watch, the shoes,

42:53.353 --> 42:54.789
bringing the baby in.

42:54.789 --> 42:57.009
It's not Lang.
His alibi's solid.

42:57.009 --> 42:58.924
But I'll call Tracey
in the morning

42:58.924 --> 43:01.013
if you want to monitor
his comm.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.584
How long have you been married?

43:08.368 --> 43:10.457
Ever since we were allowed.

43:15.549 --> 43:18.508
That's the big question:

43:18.508 --> 43:21.555
how people shape systems,
how systems shape us.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.253
Can I get you a little...

43:24.253 --> 43:26.255
- Oh, just water, thank you.

43:26.255 --> 43:28.083
Today, it's all about status.

43:28.083 --> 43:30.825
The people that have it
would kill to protect it,

43:30.825 --> 43:33.959
the people that want it
would kill to achieve it,

43:33.959 --> 43:36.352
and everybody else
gets crushed in between.

43:36.352 --> 43:40.661
Governments, corporations
and high schools.

43:40.661 --> 43:42.097
Pattern seems to be the same.

43:42.097 --> 43:43.446
How do we change that?

43:43.446 --> 43:46.536
You mean empathy, connection?

43:46.536 --> 43:48.974
If we truly see ourselves
in others,

43:48.974 --> 43:51.063
we want to raise them up,
not bring them down.

43:51.063 --> 43:52.891
If we ever run out of money,

43:52.891 --> 43:55.371
you are gonna write
fridge magnets.

43:56.982 --> 44:00.028
I'm serious--
you would be fantastic.

44:01.813 --> 44:03.858
Oh.

44:05.555 --> 44:08.080
What are they saying?

44:08.080 --> 44:10.169
You don't want to know.

44:12.127 --> 44:13.738
Gavin, I do want to know.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.827
That's why I asked.

44:15.827 --> 44:17.437
You know the drill.

44:17.437 --> 44:19.439
First 24 hours is:
"Who did this?"

44:19.439 --> 44:22.094
And then after that, it's:

44:22.094 --> 44:24.662
"Who's the idiot
that's not catching him?"

44:25.663 --> 44:27.055
No, I meant the theory.

44:27.055 --> 44:29.710
- Oh. Right.
- What's the theory?

44:29.710 --> 44:31.538
- Mm-hmm.
- Sleeper cells of terrorists

44:31.538 --> 44:33.583
in every American town,

44:33.583 --> 44:36.412
an inside job designed to scrap
civil liberties laws.

44:36.412 --> 44:37.936
Jewish plot? Take your pick.

44:37.936 --> 44:39.241
And what's yours?

44:39.241 --> 44:40.416
Such a good question.

44:40.416 --> 44:41.591
- Let me see.
- Bad call.

44:41.591 --> 44:43.898
She asked.

44:43.898 --> 44:46.945
I think your man
wasn't born here.

44:46.945 --> 44:48.816
Hmm.

44:48.816 --> 44:52.515
I think he feels
a place he grew up in

44:52.515 --> 44:54.561
has become
a pretty awful place,

44:54.561 --> 44:57.346
along with a good portion
of the world... -Mm.

44:57.346 --> 45:01.220
...and I think he believes
this nation is responsible

45:01.220 --> 45:04.136
for at least 50% of that mess.

45:04.136 --> 45:05.572
Shit.

45:05.572 --> 45:07.400
If you weren't afraid
of heights,

45:07.400 --> 45:09.010
I'd book you as a suspect.

45:09.010 --> 45:12.057
What scares me is that
a good portion of you

45:12.057 --> 45:14.581
- thinks this man has a point.
Mm-hmm.

45:14.581 --> 45:16.757
About the country
that stopped the Nazis...

45:16.757 --> 45:18.890
- Mm. Right.
- ...stepped on the moon,

45:18.890 --> 45:20.935
mapped the entire human genome

45:20.935 --> 45:23.372
and landed a spacecraft on Mars

45:23.372 --> 45:26.854
140 million miles
from your current position.

45:26.854 --> 45:32.033
While landing our brands,
our plastic, our distortion,

45:32.033 --> 45:34.732
our exaggeration
everywhere else.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.908
I went to Bogotá to lecture.

45:36.908 --> 45:38.474
Best damn coffee
on Earth, right?

45:38.474 --> 45:39.780
You know where they took me?

45:39.780 --> 45:42.087
Starbucks.

45:42.087 --> 45:43.697
We take the best of everywhere,

45:43.697 --> 45:45.568
and we send it back worse
for profit.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.396
And that's what we do
to our friends.

45:47.396 --> 45:49.007
Profits pay taxes,

45:49.007 --> 45:50.748
which pays for
research and development.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.751
- Eleanor...
- Gavin, go to bed,

45:53.751 --> 45:56.362
or I'll arrest you for
harassing two public servants.

45:56.362 --> 45:57.798
- I give up. I give up.

46:06.241 --> 46:08.548
So, Eleanor,
why did you lie to me?

46:08.548 --> 46:10.289
Sir?

46:11.551 --> 46:13.335
You were rejected
by the Bureau.

46:13.335 --> 46:15.076
You decided not to tell me?

46:15.076 --> 46:17.992
That's what pissed me off,
not the lab report.

46:17.992 --> 46:19.602
Yeah, it was eight years ago.

46:19.602 --> 46:21.430
I didn't think it would matter.

46:22.780 --> 46:25.173
We're under the microscope.

46:26.348 --> 46:28.220
Everything matters.

46:31.658 --> 46:33.399
I just thought
I could prove myself

46:33.399 --> 46:35.227
before I got found out.

46:37.403 --> 46:39.187
I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

46:39.187 --> 46:41.624
You aced observation
and knowledge.

46:41.624 --> 46:44.149
It was your psych eval
that did you in.

46:44.149 --> 46:47.587
"Aggressive, addictive,
antisocial."

46:47.587 --> 46:49.894
This is the profile
of people we arrest, not hire.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.768
You know when they ask you
to draw a tree? -Mm-hmm.

46:54.768 --> 46:57.336
The trunk represents
your life up to the present.

46:57.336 --> 46:59.251
- Yeah.
- And from the picture,

46:59.251 --> 47:02.689
Dr. Katz conjectured
that something fucked you up,

47:02.689 --> 47:05.866
and pretty badly,
around the age of 12.

47:05.866 --> 47:07.563
There's no soil.

47:07.563 --> 47:09.609
Tree has no roots, no fruit.

47:09.609 --> 47:11.698
Did something happen back then?

47:11.698 --> 47:14.440
- Is this necessary?
- It's not mandatory.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.269
I just want to know
if we should fire Dr. Katz,

47:17.269 --> 47:20.925
'cause I think you got talent.

47:20.925 --> 47:23.797
"Have you ever tried
any illegal substances?"

47:23.797 --> 47:26.147
"Yes." "Which ones?"
"All of them."

47:26.147 --> 47:28.323
That didn't help
your application, either.

47:28.323 --> 47:29.847
What were you thinking?

47:30.891 --> 47:34.155
Kurt Cobain: "I'd rather
be hated for who I am

47:34.155 --> 47:35.983
than loved for who I'm not."

47:35.983 --> 47:37.898
Yeah.

47:37.898 --> 47:40.770
He's not exactly a role model,
according to the Bureau.

47:40.770 --> 47:43.121
You worked at a dry cleaner's
and with a call center.

47:43.121 --> 47:45.384
Hey, why didn't you look for
something with more prospects?

47:45.384 --> 47:46.907
You're smart, articulate.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.387
Well, that doesn't
count for much

47:48.387 --> 47:49.910
when you don't go to college.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.912
So, why didn't you?

47:51.912 --> 47:54.393
Because there was no one
to pay for it.

47:54.393 --> 47:56.438
And when you work all day
trying to make rent,

47:56.438 --> 47:59.354
you don't feel like studying;
you feel like sleeping.

47:59.354 --> 48:01.791
What led you
to law enforcement?

48:01.791 --> 48:04.359
I was looking for protection.

48:04.359 --> 48:06.274
From who?

48:08.798 --> 48:11.018
From myself.

48:11.018 --> 48:12.759
That enough for you?

48:12.759 --> 48:14.500
No.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.023
Eleanor...

48:17.720 --> 48:22.290
...the only thing enough for me
is a solid lead.

48:22.290 --> 48:25.337
The hatred
that drives our shooter

48:25.337 --> 48:27.948
isn't so different from yours.

48:27.948 --> 48:31.169
Instead of going out there
and wiping everybody out,

48:31.169 --> 48:33.432
you turn it against yourself.

48:33.432 --> 48:37.044
I need you to use it as fuel
to bring me something new.

48:37.044 --> 48:39.351
Now.

48:39.351 --> 48:43.050
We get this guy,
this all goes away.

48:43.050 --> 48:46.836
And we can both do the job
we were meant to.

49:22.829 --> 49:24.222
Would you like your teeth
whitened, ma'am?

49:24.222 --> 49:25.963
We can do it
right here on the spot.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.747
Not today.
- You'll notice the difference

49:27.747 --> 49:29.488
- in just five minutes.
- Thank you, dear.

49:29.488 --> 49:31.316
Brighten your sm...

49:55.557 --> 49:58.343
WOMAN [over P.A.]: Ladies,
if you're longing for summer,

49:58.343 --> 50:00.475
it's time to start
getting in shape.

50:00.475 --> 50:04.001
Come for a free consultation
in the second-floor beauty bar.

50:06.568 --> 50:08.135
MAN [over P.A.]:
Please do not leave

50:08.135 --> 50:10.094
any store bags unattended.

50:10.094 --> 50:12.705
If you see anything suspicious,
just tell our security team.

50:12.705 --> 50:14.533
Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

50:14.533 --> 50:17.144
Uh, I think you took my stuff
by mistake.

50:17.144 --> 50:18.667
My own clothes.

50:30.462 --> 50:32.420
What the hell is wrong
with you, bro?

50:44.737 --> 50:47.174
Uh, excuse me.

50:47.174 --> 50:48.828
You got a guy giving himself

50:48.828 --> 50:50.699
a full body wash
in the basin back there.

50:50.699 --> 50:52.832
Uh-huh. -I mean,
I'm guessing he's got issues,

50:52.832 --> 50:55.052
- but seriously, not cool.
- Yeah, I got it.

50:56.618 --> 50:58.794
MAN [over radio]: Can we get
someone down to level three?

50:58.794 --> 51:00.361
I-I got a guy here.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.581
Uh, somebody ran off
with his clothes.

51:12.591 --> 51:15.550
Let's call dispatch.
There's no one here.

51:24.385 --> 51:27.301
Oh, my God. What's he doing?

51:27.301 --> 51:29.129
- I'm tired of these dudes.
- Hey.

51:29.129 --> 51:31.044
Where's your sense
of self-respect?

51:31.044 --> 51:32.654
You're not an animal.

51:32.654 --> 51:34.526
- Ignore him. It's...
- I...

51:34.526 --> 51:36.484
Hey!

51:36.484 --> 51:37.746
Sir!

51:40.662 --> 51:42.403
Sir, stop right there.

51:42.403 --> 51:44.536
Hold it!

51:44.536 --> 51:47.278
Gonna need to take a look
in the bag, sir.

51:47.278 --> 51:49.106
Don't make us ask twice.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.890
Just open the bag, sir.

51:50.890 --> 51:52.761
- I just want to go home.
- I know you want to go home.

51:52.761 --> 51:54.372
We just need to see
the contents of the bag.

51:54.372 --> 51:56.243
Please, can you open
that up for us?

51:56.243 --> 51:57.766
- I just want to go.
- We'll let you go.

51:57.766 --> 51:59.159
We just need you
to open that bag.

51:59.159 --> 52:01.161
Open the bag right now, please.

52:01.161 --> 52:02.728
Open the bag.
- Sir, don't make me ask again.

52:02.728 --> 52:04.208
- Open the bag.
Open the bag!

52:04.208 --> 52:05.470
Fuck!

52:10.170 --> 52:13.217
I haven't seen
an XM21 in years,

52:13.217 --> 52:15.175
but they're around
if you know where to look.

52:15.175 --> 52:16.611
Where would I look?

52:16.611 --> 52:18.874
DoD's the only
government department

52:18.874 --> 52:21.790
that's failed every audit
for the last 25 years.

52:21.790 --> 52:24.967
They lost track of a billion
dollars' worth of weapons

52:24.967 --> 52:26.795
in Iraq and Kuwait alone.

52:26.795 --> 52:29.015
Mr. Lassky, why would you buy
a vintage weapon

52:29.015 --> 52:30.582
when there are
newer ones available?

52:30.582 --> 52:33.280
Well, ofttimes, they're better.

52:33.280 --> 52:36.849
Easy load, easy clean,
standard ammo.

52:36.849 --> 52:38.894
Like that 1853 Enfield?

52:38.894 --> 52:40.940
Yeah.

52:40.940 --> 52:42.202
That's a classic.

52:42.202 --> 52:44.378
Used by the Confederate forces.

52:44.378 --> 52:46.467
And the Ku Klux Klan.

52:49.253 --> 52:52.169
Listen, I'm not doing
anything illegal here.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.909
The history of America...

52:53.909 --> 52:56.782
Milkor BXP? In Maryland?

52:56.782 --> 52:58.392
It's pretty illegal.

53:00.133 --> 53:01.613
Look, Mr. Lassky,
I'm gonna need

53:01.613 --> 53:03.136
a list of all of your clients.

53:03.136 --> 53:04.659
If this guy's one of them

53:04.659 --> 53:06.139
and you withheld
that information...

53:18.107 --> 53:19.805
MAN [over radio]:
Got two paramedic teams here.

53:19.805 --> 53:21.067
- Can they enter?
Copy that.

53:27.465 --> 53:29.641
We'll send an escort.
Which entryway, please?

53:29.641 --> 53:32.078
Copy that. Okay, keep moving.

54:04.023 --> 54:06.199
OFFICER [over radio]:
We have a Black male, 35,

54:06.199 --> 54:08.636
- five-ten, 220 pounds...

54:08.636 --> 54:10.247
Are they even listening?

54:10.247 --> 54:12.771
Guy's over six feet,
white as my ass.

54:12.771 --> 54:15.252
Yeah. I'll go set 'em straight.

54:18.603 --> 54:20.648
- OFFICER [over radio]:
- I repeat, ,

54:20.648 --> 54:22.520
35, five-ten, 220 pounds...

54:22.520 --> 54:24.173
Okay.

54:24.173 --> 54:26.915
...Magnum .357
in the back of his trunk.

54:49.677 --> 54:52.027
That's got to be the weirdest
fucking thing I've ever seen.

54:52.027 --> 54:53.681
Talk to Sam.

54:53.681 --> 54:56.205
Reflections in windows,
cameras in stores.

54:56.205 --> 54:59.426
We should be able to get
a 3D printout of this guy.

55:06.477 --> 55:08.566
Sorry, there's no...
there's no cameras in there.

55:08.566 --> 55:10.742
Not yet.

55:11.743 --> 55:13.745
W-W-Wait. Rewind that.

55:18.184 --> 55:20.142
- That's his shirt.

55:20.142 --> 55:23.102
- Take me to that restroom.
- Yeah, sure.

55:36.463 --> 55:38.639
He didn't come here to kill.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.860
He came here to eat.

55:41.860 --> 55:43.818
To get new clothes.

55:45.254 --> 55:47.213
To clean up.

55:47.213 --> 55:50.347
A dog who knows
where the leftovers are.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.653
Smart enough
not to leave any fingerprints.

55:55.917 --> 55:58.833
Is he just picking out
the vegetables? -Yeah.

55:58.833 --> 56:00.792
There's your iron deficiency.

56:00.792 --> 56:03.229
Our dog is a herbivore.

56:14.936 --> 56:16.416
Christ.

56:16.416 --> 56:18.549
The marksmanship.

56:22.117 --> 56:24.598
Cool as a fucking cucumber.

56:31.257 --> 56:33.041
He doesn't want to engage.

56:39.047 --> 56:40.962
This is like fucking "Pac-Man."

56:45.837 --> 56:47.578
Who trained him?

56:47.578 --> 56:50.581
Not the Army.

56:50.581 --> 56:54.933
Weapons are an extensionof hims.

56:55.934 --> 56:57.370
He was born among 'em.

57:26.965 --> 57:28.793
McKENZIE [over radio]:
Bad news here.

57:30.534 --> 57:32.405
What is it?
The cleaning crew

57:32.405 --> 57:34.015
came through
before the shooting began.

57:34.015 --> 57:35.843
The trucks pick up at 2:00.

57:35.843 --> 57:38.019
Oh, my God.
- Where do they go?

57:41.719 --> 57:43.372
Ugh.

57:43.372 --> 57:45.374
I can't tell what's gonna
happen to me first--

57:45.374 --> 57:47.028
I'm gonna have a heart attack,

57:47.028 --> 57:48.900
- or I'm gonna get fired.
Yeah.

57:48.900 --> 57:50.379
Well, thanks
for the reassurance.

57:50.379 --> 57:51.946
You're just being paranoid.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.212
Look, in case I'm not,

57:57.212 --> 57:59.127
work side by side
with McKenzie.

57:59.127 --> 58:01.695
Stop that truck.
If we can get that DNA...

58:01.695 --> 58:04.611
- Mac, where are you?

58:04.611 --> 58:06.700
- Take her with you.
Yeah.

58:06.700 --> 58:08.920
I'm just letting him
think he's in charge.

58:23.804 --> 58:25.719
Hey, Lammark.

58:28.461 --> 58:30.898
Take your pills.
Ignore the clowns.

58:30.898 --> 58:32.987
Fight the jackals.

58:33.988 --> 58:35.860
Get out of here.

58:57.055 --> 58:59.927
Whole building
takes a shit four times a day.

58:59.927 --> 59:02.713
Everything gets mixed together,
compressed in the trucks

59:02.713 --> 59:04.628
and then dropped here.

59:06.934 --> 59:08.327
Thank you.

59:08.327 --> 59:09.676
Thank you, gentlemen.

59:09.676 --> 59:10.808
Thanks.

59:10.808 --> 59:12.723
We're looking for a green shirt

59:12.723 --> 59:13.985
someone dropped
in the second-floor restroom.

59:13.985 --> 59:15.943
- Any tips?
- Yeah.

59:15.943 --> 59:17.902
Don't eat the sushi.

59:19.730 --> 59:21.906
Isn't the, uh, organic stuff

59:21.906 --> 59:23.821
supposed to get separated
from recycling?

59:23.821 --> 59:26.040
Yeah, but we don't do that yet.

59:26.040 --> 59:28.434
I guess they're still telling
people to separate their trash

59:28.434 --> 59:30.088
to raise awareness
or something.

59:30.088 --> 59:32.220
- Who knows?
- Right.

59:32.220 --> 59:35.006
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, don't mention it.

01:00:22.662 --> 01:00:24.708
One of the biggest
attacks in American history,

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.710
and all we can offer is
"please stay indoors"?

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.712
Nathan, it's been
less than 72 hours

01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:30.409
since the first shooting.

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:32.063
And people already think
you lost control.

01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:33.673
We need a game changer.

01:00:33.673 --> 01:00:35.936
- This could be it.
- No, no, no.

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:38.417
We still don't have a face.

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:39.723
Let's show the way he moves.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.289
Two and a half million viewers.

01:00:41.289 --> 01:00:43.248
Someone's got to know this guy.

01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:45.424
Kittridge is an idiot.
Idiots are unpredictable.

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:47.252
It's Pandora's fucking box.

01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:50.777
We risk unleashing problems
we don't even have.

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:52.387
I'd rather take a fucking risk

01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:53.867
than have people think
we have nothing.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.129
I mean the risk
to the population,

01:00:55.129 --> 01:00:56.957
not your administration.

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.924
That's a lead.

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:08.360
Hair, sweat.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.275
What about prints?

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:13.713
On most fabrics, it's unlikely,
but let my team do their job.

01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:16.368
Look, I don't think
you're listening, Lammark.

01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:18.065
The decision's
out of your hands.

01:01:18.065 --> 01:01:20.241
You don't play along,
so is this investigation.

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.939
This doesn't look very good.

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.419
- No, it doesn't. At all.
- KITTRIDGE [on TV]: Beware.

01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:26.683
The exclusive footage
you are about to see

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.816
contains extremely
disturbing images.

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:32.732
If you're with kids
or sensitive to violence,

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:35.648
then please look away now.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.782
These acts are horrifying,

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:40.740
but they're not
the product of a monster.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.873
They're the product of a man.

01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:46.615
A dangerous man, sure,
but damaged, too.

01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:50.924
That's why I make this plea.

01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:55.973
If you know this man,
if you love this man,

01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:59.237
if you are this man,
then call this number.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:00.847
Well...
- We're here to help.

01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:03.241
...there's the Nobel
for the worst fucking idea.

01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:08.028
Teamwork makes the dream work.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.509
Oh, fuck off, Frank.

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:12.816
Now, with me tonight
is Martha Curry, professor...

01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:14.948
HDM, World War II era.

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:17.516
OSS pistol of choice.

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:19.736
Hard to find outside
Special Forces inventories.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.650
CURRY [on TV]: When it comes
to mental disorders,

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:23.478
violence is
more commonly reactive

01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:25.002
than planned, triggered by...

01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:26.438
Okay, I got to stop you there.

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:28.309
We have a caller. Hello.

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.703
WOMAN [on TV]:
I'm scared of my husband.

01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:32.531
He's been acting weird lately.
He's...

01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:34.272
Does this man
look like your husband?

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:35.882
Could this be him?

01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.797
Actually not, but still...

01:02:37.797 --> 01:02:40.278
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
This isn't marriage guidance.

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:43.803
We are here to identify
a mass murderer.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:46.937
All right. Arsenal keepers
from the last 50 years.

01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:49.678
Green means solid alibi,
blue still TBC.

01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:51.376
We're targeting
the ones in pink.

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.857
They've been discharged
from the Forces.

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.467
And the yellow?

01:02:55.467 --> 01:02:57.904
Oh, they're dead.
Pretty solid alibi.

01:02:57.904 --> 01:03:00.733
Yeah, I think
we can safely assume

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:03.823
that the shooter
is amongst the living.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:07.174
Munitions this old could be
quite the inheritance, sir.

01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:09.611
That's a damn good point.

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:13.485
Damn good point.

01:03:19.752 --> 01:03:22.581
Okay. Mall footprint analysis.

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.452
Cat work boots, six years old.

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.150
He's not the first owner.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.500
Soles worn on the left.
He favors the right.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.330
Also sawdust, wood chips
and paint traces.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.767
MAN [on TV]: I know who killed
a thousand people last year.

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.769
- The police did.
Sir, 24 officers

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:38.815
just died in that mall.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:41.426
The police risk their lives
to protect you.

01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:43.776
...Daunte Wright,
Andre Hill, Breonna Taylor.

01:03:43.776 --> 01:03:45.778
Should I go on?

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:48.085
We are looking to
make television history here.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.521
This number is exclusively...

01:03:58.008 --> 01:04:00.575
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.751
I saw that in a school room.

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:07.365
When have you last seen
"Thou shalt not kill"?

01:04:07.365 --> 01:04:09.323
When have you last seen that?

01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:12.892
My goal here today is to try
to calm things down,

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.894
not make things worse.

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:30.040

- Because-because... ]

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.693
Try to have a dialogue.

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:33.086
Sir, you came up
with a dumb statement...

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.350
...that came from
your prejudiced heart.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.091
Sweden was founded by Vikings.

01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:39.788
Shirt results just in.

01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:41.747
Mm-hmm?
- All right.

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:43.531
No fingerprints, but CODIS
found hair and skin particles.

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:45.272
Hair's brittle near the ends,

01:04:45.272 --> 01:04:47.753
and when it falls out,
so do fragments of the skin.

01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:50.103
What are they trying to do?
Sell me dandruff shampoo?

01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:52.149
No, it's common among people

01:04:52.149 --> 01:04:53.933
who suffered
severe head trauma.

01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:55.761
The majority
of the last shootings

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:57.894
have all been involved
with these kids.

01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:06.293
And you are live on
"The Kittridge Show."

01:05:06.293 --> 01:05:07.947
Don't be shy.

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:11.255
I'm not shy. I'm proud.

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:13.910
Proud? Of what?

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.476
Proud of my people.

01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:17.174
Proud of our soldier.

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:18.610
Oh, you're an army?

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.133
Are you commanding these guys?

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:21.787
What do you want,
cheaper sneakers?

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.397
They're on it.
They're tracking him down.

01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:24.398
'Cause not many great battles

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:25.922
were fought in a mall.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.575
This isn't a game.

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:29.273
It's a reset.

01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:30.709
- Our nation's promise restored.

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.406
He used a prepaid AT line

01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:34.060
and dialed star 67
to hide his number.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.844
Okay.
- That works?

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.411
How do I know you're not

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:39.152
just some kid
with a voice distortion app,

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:42.155
jerking off on
a swastika flag? -

01:05:42.155 --> 01:05:44.984
An HDM? An Ingram MAC-10?

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:46.594
Those are not kids' toys.

01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:48.553
You can mock me
from your ivory castle,

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:50.207
but your time is coming,
too, my friend.

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.338
Whoa.

01:05:51.338 --> 01:05:52.905
Phone was bought at Walmart

01:05:52.905 --> 01:05:54.385
in Montgomery County
25 minutes ago.

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:55.908
I'm shaking in my shoes.

01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:56.909
You know, I hope
you're dumb enough

01:05:56.909 --> 01:05:58.128
to come after me.

01:05:58.128 --> 01:05:59.781
I think you'll find my castle

01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:01.566
- is pretty well secured.

01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:02.915
Your
daughter's college room isn't.

01:06:02.915 --> 01:06:04.743
Paid in cash,
no credit card info.

01:06:04.743 --> 01:06:06.179
300 million Americans.

01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:08.138
400 million guns.

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:10.792
And I'm sure someone out there
would love to lend a hand.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:12.229
That's enough
to get you in jail.

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:14.013
Worst fucking idea, indeed.

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.710
You know
they'll find you, right?

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.190
Only a matter of time.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:18.887
Not sure about that.

01:06:18.887 --> 01:06:21.020
Half the crimes in this country
never get solved.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.456
- Your tax dollars go

01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:23.892
to defense contractors--

01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:25.459
- drones, missiles, nukes...
- What?

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.983
What?

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.854
...but those can't
protect you from us.

01:06:28.854 --> 01:06:30.812
So you don't like our?

01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:32.989
My sister's pregnant.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.816
- Jesus, Mac.
- I'm-I'm sorry, everybody.

01:06:34.816 --> 01:06:36.862
The real enemy lies within.

01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:38.690
Taking our jobs,
taking our land,

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.474
taking our women.

01:06:40.474 --> 01:06:43.303
While they're overseaswiping ou,

01:06:43.303 --> 01:06:45.653
we can handle
all the Blacks and yellows

01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:48.004
and the nigger-loving,
money-hungry Jews as well.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.353
- Fucking sick.
- If our so-called leaders

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:50.963
won't speak up for us,

01:06:50.963 --> 01:06:52.573
- our rifles will.

01:06:52.573 --> 01:06:54.227
They've located the register,

01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:55.663
and they're patching through
the security feed.

01:06:55.663 --> 01:06:57.535
Okay, look, if you ace

01:06:57.535 --> 01:06:59.058
behind these attacks,
I'm gonna speak on behalf

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:01.104
of the families
you've destroyed.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.670
You're a coward.

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.585
You're a hack,
an attention seeker.

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:06.196
The invisible
army is ready to fight.

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:08.111
Don't kill yourselves, boys.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.330
Your pain's not a weakness.

01:07:10.330 --> 01:07:11.897
It's a weapon.

01:07:11.897 --> 01:07:13.638
- Time to use it.

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:14.987
Hello?

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.597
Okay, they got him.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.562
The call began
at 8:21 in Somerset,

01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:27.304
ended at 8:29
five miles southwest.

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:29.132
A minute later,
the chip went dead,

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:31.830
but the phone's GPS matches
that of a Chevy Silverado,

01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:34.485
license plate
Alpha, Lima, Xray,

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.182
eight, zero, eight.

01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.315
Registered to
a David Lee Hicks.

01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:41.666
He's an NRA member
and a legal owner of an AR-15,

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:44.234
an AK-47
and a bunch of hunting rifles.

01:07:44.234 --> 01:07:47.019
He's also a member of the local
branch of Three Percenters.

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.934
He hates government,
liberals and Jews.

01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:50.675
COMMANDER [over radio]:
This is Somerset commander.

01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.633
We got a comms van
and tactical gear

01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:54.244
ready for you on the tarmac.

01:07:54.244 --> 01:07:56.115
Please advise ETA.

01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:03.253
What is it, Eleanor?

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:05.646
The NRA? The Three Percent?

01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:07.648
Our guy's a loner,
not a joiner.

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:09.172
Okay.

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:10.869
Your objection is duly noted.

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.654
A man on a mission
does not stop for falafel.

01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.482
This is not our killer.
This isn't our case.

01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:16.918
Let someone else
take care of it.

01:08:16.918 --> 01:08:19.486
I can't. I'm following orders.

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:22.010
Even when you know
they're wrong?

01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:29.409
Power is disputed
between people who deserve it

01:08:29.409 --> 01:08:31.237
and people who adore it.

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:32.934
It's a perpetual fight.

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:35.111
I can't say we're winning.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.896
Right now,
we got to stay in the ring.

01:08:37.896 --> 01:08:40.203
Sir, with all due respect...

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:43.206
Oh, goddamn it, Eleanor!
You're following orders, too!

01:08:49.734 --> 01:08:51.039
COMMANDER [over radio]:
They're heading down

01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:52.476
Wisconsin Avenue, car 17.

01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:53.825
Intercept
at Friendship Heights.

01:08:53.825 --> 01:08:55.261
Copy that.

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:34.866
Jesus, it's fucking cold.

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:45.093
Okay.

01:09:45.093 --> 01:09:47.270
O.K. Corral.

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:56.540
You owned that moron, man.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.238
Shit's going down after this.

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:09.292
Guys, now he's thanking the
cops for protecting his kid.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:14.253
These fucking guys--
never risk anything,

01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:17.648
and they think the world
spins around them.

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:24.568
Right, 'cause when
you're on TV,

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.265
all the pigs come running.

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.789
But who the fuck's
protecting our kids? Huh?

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:31.575
Who the fuck's
protecting our kids?

01:10:31.575 --> 01:10:33.794
We're protecting our kids,
you moron.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.971
Well, I'm starving.

01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:46.111
Whole police force
shielding a dorm room

01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:49.245
while bodies pile up
in the streets.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.552
He doesn't know
what's coming to him.

01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:55.294
"Invisible army" is trending.

01:10:55.294 --> 01:10:56.904
This is a game changer, guys.

01:10:56.904 --> 01:10:58.993
Something has to happen.

01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:05.826
Okay, so shampoo?

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:08.089
Yes, and some Whitestrips.

01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:10.396
-  Yeah.
- Please.

01:11:10.396 --> 01:11:12.485
- Okay.
- Oh, candy!

01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:20.580
- I know who's paying.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:26.107
Fucking light beer, light b,

01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:28.240
light beer, light beer.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.417
Who owns this place,
the Mormons?

01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.419
Shh.

01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:35.160
I'll take that for you.

01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:44.430
Let's go to a fucking bar.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.476
Ah, you'll get drunk
and start showing off.

01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:48.173
I prefer to stay out
of trouble.

01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:50.001
I'll meet you in the car?

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:52.656
Um, did you get
the pills for your dad?

01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:56.442
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:04.058
Sir?

01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:05.712
Hi.

01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:09.020
- What's that?
- Um, it's... Can you...

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.370
Not your night, huh?

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.590
Sir, can you come with me, please?

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.070
Speak up, girl.
I can't hear you.

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.681
Just-just come
with me this way, sir.

01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:20.118
I-Is this a survey?-No, no, no.

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.902
Um, I just... We...

01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:23.556
Can you... Can you come with me
really quickly, please?

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.210
Well, I'm in a rush.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.777
I have to go home.
My-my wife...

01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.561
Yeah, that's-that's all...
That's okay.

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:30.476
That's okay. -M-My wife
is sick, and I'm in a rush.

01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:32.304
Yeah, I-I just
need you to come with me.

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:34.611
I-I really can't. -Sir, I need .

01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:36.743
I really don't have that much
time. -Sir, come with me now!

01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:39.006
My wife... my-my wife
is waiting for me. -Now!

01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:51.410
- FBI!
- Drop your weapon!

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:52.759
Fuck you!

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:54.370
Drop it now!

01:12:55.632 --> 01:12:57.111
Drop it!

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.384
- Falco!
- We're good!

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.830
ELEANOR [panting]:
Oh, my God.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.269
FBI!

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:25.531
Eyes on me!

01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:29.666
Fuck.

01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:31.929
- Fuck!
- I need you to drop the weapon

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:33.757
and show me those hands.

01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:35.672
- You fucking nigger!
- I don't need that.

01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:38.109
I need you to drop the weapon
and get those hands up.

01:13:38.109 --> 01:13:40.328
Get the fuck out of here!

01:13:40.328 --> 01:13:41.678
Get the fuck out of this place!

01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:43.462
Drop your weapon
and show me your hands.

01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:45.595
I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out.

01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:48.424
David, drop the weapon
and get those hands up!

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.295
- No nigger's gonna...

01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:06.050
For the last time,
just fuck off.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.139
Hey, don't fucking
talk to me like that.

01:14:08.139 --> 01:14:09.836
I need to know what you did,

01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:11.751
I need to know who's involved,
and I need to know...

01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.188
He's basically saying
it's a prank gone wrong.

01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:16.843
Tracey confirmed it.

01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:19.672
The army's not invisible.
It just doesn't exist at all.

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.935
There's no organization,
no communications.

01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:23.459
You fucking tell us something...

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.025
Just some copy-and-paste

01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:26.505
conspiracy bullshit
on a Facebook page

01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:27.898
with 23 likes.

01:14:27.898 --> 01:14:29.377
And that call to Kittridge

01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:31.423
caused serious
collateral damage.

01:14:33.338 --> 01:14:35.340
Mr. Lammark,
did you give the order

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.343
to share the mall footage
with "The Kittridge Show"?

01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:40.911
It was not my strategy.

01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:44.871
I advised that the plan
was risky and flawed.

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:46.438
But this was
your investigation?

01:14:46.438 --> 01:14:49.267
- You had overall control?
-  Yes.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:51.095
Was it also under your command
that the public

01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:53.924
were encouraged to call inwitho?

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.016
Yes, ma'am.

01:14:59.016 --> 01:15:01.018
Just a half hour
after the show ended,

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.542
two teenagers shot
two people dead

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.936
and wounded three more
before taking their own lives.

01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:08.242
In Boston,
a Molotov cocktail was thrown

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:10.070
through the window
of Temple Israel,

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.682
causing the janitor
life-changing injuries.

01:15:12.682 --> 01:15:14.901
Do you accept responsibility
for these crimes?

01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:16.990
We all know
what's going on here.

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.863
This is not about
the deaths of young men.

01:15:19.863 --> 01:15:21.560
This is about the ambitions
of old ones.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.519
Do you know the name
of the killer?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.433
I know he's someone who's lived
off the grid for obviously...

01:15:25.433 --> 01:15:27.305
Mr. Lammark,
please answer the question.

01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:30.047
Do you know his profession?
His place of residence?

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:31.614
Not yet.

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:33.180
It seems that,
under your command,

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.356
information is no cure
for ignorance.

01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:37.620
Perhaps if you'd paid
more attention to people

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.186
who were qualified to help.

01:15:39.186 --> 01:15:41.449
This internal report
suggests that

01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:44.017
you've been taking your lead
from a police officer

01:15:44.017 --> 01:15:45.845
with no investigative experience,

01:15:45.845 --> 01:15:47.455
rejected by the Bureau,

01:15:47.455 --> 01:15:48.979
with a long and proven
record of addiction.

01:15:48.979 --> 01:15:51.198
Am I right?

01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:53.287
Well, that's not what
I took from her application.

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:56.813
I saw a fiercely honest,
highly motivated person.

01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:59.163
While everyone else
was helping residents

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:01.557
flee a burning building,
Officer Falco was the only one

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.559
with the presence of mind
to film them doing it.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.952
Had our perpetrator been
amongst those exiting,

01:16:05.952 --> 01:16:08.564
it would've been solely
down to her.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:11.305
I know talent when I see it.
It's a pivotal part of my job.

01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:13.307
Perhaps, Mr. Lammark,
we should consider

01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:15.135
whether your pursuit
of new talent

01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:16.876
is because you know
your own is failing.

01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:18.965
You've been
a fine public servant,

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:20.619
and you've fought your illness
with courage, but...

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:22.621
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:26.843
I know this man.

01:16:26.843 --> 01:16:29.672
I know how to find him.

01:16:29.672 --> 01:16:31.674
You can fire me.

01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:34.111
You get your sacrifice.

01:16:34.111 --> 01:16:38.158
You keep me,
you will get your killer.

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:41.858
What do you want?

01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:57.090
♪ Black dogs
and black crows... ♪

01:16:58.265 --> 01:16:59.963
It's everywhere.

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:02.530
What's it been, 45 minutes?

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:05.272
They had
the press release ready.

01:17:05.272 --> 01:17:07.710
"Lammarked man."

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.537
"Lammark could piss
his own pants,

01:17:09.537 --> 01:17:11.452
still not find out who did it."

01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:13.672
-"Lammark..."
- Listen, don't read that mess.

01:17:13.672 --> 01:17:17.197
Assholes are attracted to
comments like flies to shit.

01:17:17.197 --> 01:17:18.851
Yeah.

01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:28.948
Who?

01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:31.037
What?

01:17:31.037 --> 01:17:33.474
Come on.

01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:36.086
- It's Morales.

01:17:36.086 --> 01:17:37.870
I'm to report at 7:00 a.m.,

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:39.655
and he's requesting
your passwords.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.569
Morales.

01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:43.180
He's good.

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.664
We tried hard.

01:17:50.056 --> 01:17:51.579
But we got nothing.

01:17:51.579 --> 01:17:53.320
Sir, um...

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.757
Eleanor.

01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:58.717
They used you as the rope.

01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:00.893
- You're not the hangman.

01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:05.637
All right.

01:18:05.637 --> 01:18:06.943
Oh, shit.

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:09.119
- Time to go home.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:12.165
Oh. Good to see you
taking it so well.

01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:13.906
Come on.
Not in front of the kids.

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.081
Yeah.
Hmm?

01:18:15.081 --> 01:18:16.604
I got to pay.

01:18:16.604 --> 01:18:18.041
No, no, no. This is on them.

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:20.043
Thanks for the drinks, guys.

01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:25.309
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:18:25.309 --> 01:18:26.876
Okay.

01:18:26.876 --> 01:18:28.878

What the fuck is...

01:21:03.336 --> 01:21:05.382
You know what
I couldn't wrap my head around

01:21:05.382 --> 01:21:07.384
is how you could be
in two places at once.

01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:09.473
And then it hit me.

01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:11.214
You're outsourcing.

01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:12.432
Give me that.

01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:13.738
Hey, hey, be careful.

01:21:13.738 --> 01:21:15.435
You painted the living room

01:21:15.435 --> 01:21:16.915
with the guys from DeLuxe
on March 12th.

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:18.874
And then,
for the next two days,

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.876
you gave the keys to someone
else to finish the bedrooms.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.530
That's how you made time
for the Ultraviolet job

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:25.663
on March 13th and March 14th.

01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:26.969
So my question is:

01:21:26.969 --> 01:21:28.405
Who the fuck
did you give them to?

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:30.407
What am I, a suspect here?

01:21:30.407 --> 01:21:32.757
'Cause I think I need to call
my fucking lawyer right now.

01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:35.020
No, you... -Just tell her
the fucking truth!

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:53.996
Sorry to wake you so early.

01:21:53.996 --> 01:21:55.867
I just... I figured
you'd want a head start.

01:21:55.867 --> 01:21:57.913
I started monitoring his comms,
and I made the connection.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.392
Desmond, the baby,

01:21:59.392 --> 01:22:01.220
was a distraction technique
all along.

01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:06.747
Okay, I've been
gaming the system.

01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:09.054
Taking more jobs than
I can handle.

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:12.797
Calling in other guys--
Armenians, Mexicans, Poles.

01:22:12.797 --> 01:22:14.930
Very equal-opportunity of you.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.149
Well, everybody got
their fair cut.

01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:18.890
And with these
new regulations and shit,

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:21.023
even they got expensive.

01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:23.242
Till I found this list.

01:22:23.242 --> 01:22:24.983
Ex-cons, guys with a record

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.680
- nobody would hire.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.247
Get the fuck out of here!

01:22:28.247 --> 01:22:29.857
The dog! Come on!

01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:31.859
Fucking dog.

01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:34.950
These guys,
they work for next to nothing,

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.777
as long as you don't ask 'em
too many questions.

01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:38.997
And believe me, you don't want
to chat with these guys anyway.

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:41.478
I would always bring in lunch.
All right, that way, they could

01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:43.132
- work through the day.
Mm-hmm.

01:22:43.132 --> 01:22:46.439
And there's this one guy,
real particular.

01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:48.615
No meat, no dairy.

01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:50.574
Like some kind
of goddamn fucking monk.

01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:53.359
So, one day, I ask him: "Why?"

01:22:53.359 --> 01:22:57.320
He says he used to work
in a slaughterhouse downstate.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.800
After that,
never could eat meat again.

01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:03.717
I only knew him as Dean.

01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.981
Tall guy, always wearing a cap.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.678
It's him.

01:23:07.678 --> 01:23:10.028
He stopped answering.

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.769
I stopped calling.

01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:14.076
Phone's a burner.
It's been dead for months.

01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:16.078
There's only three
slaughterhouses downstate.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.036
Look, I was scared.

01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:19.820
I didn't want to get arrested.

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.648
I was scared this guy
would come after me.

01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:24.564
I got a fucking family.

01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:36.272
He's out back.

01:24:45.732 --> 01:24:48.344
Can I ask you guys
some questions? -Okay.

01:24:48.344 --> 01:24:50.911
Um, does this man
look familiar to you?

01:25:07.145 --> 01:25:09.060
Excuse me. Gentlemen.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.844
I'd just like a moment
of your time, please.

01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.237
I'm with the FBI.

01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:13.760
This guy is wanted
in connection

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.153
with a multiple,
multiple homicide.

01:25:15.153 --> 01:25:16.285
I'm wondering
if any of you guys

01:25:16.285 --> 01:25:18.287
might have seen him before.

01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:20.767
Take a look. He was here
probably a decade ago or more.

01:25:20.767 --> 01:25:22.160
Maybe? No?

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.422
Maybe works here still.

01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:24.989
No.

01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:27.905
But I didn't start here
till 2014.

01:25:27.905 --> 01:25:30.429
You guys need to talk to...

01:25:33.737 --> 01:25:35.391
Hey, Ramona!

01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:38.307
Ramona, come over here.

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:45.140
This guy look familiar?

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.881
Familiar?
That's Dean fucking Possey.

01:25:50.232 --> 01:25:52.495
Kept his head down. No trouble.

01:25:52.495 --> 01:25:54.323
Didn't like to socialize.

01:25:54.323 --> 01:25:57.195
But Alonso,
the supervisor back then,

01:25:57.195 --> 01:25:59.154
he was always teasing Dean.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.677
Called him Quasimodo

01:26:00.677 --> 01:26:02.461
'cause his head had
a creepy shape.

01:26:02.461 --> 01:26:04.985
Nasty, stupid shit.

01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:08.163
And then one night,
back around '98,

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:11.688
they share the last shift
on the hamburger sector.

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:14.386
We get in the next morning,
and Alonso's all ground up

01:26:14.386 --> 01:26:17.215
at three eighths of an inch.

01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:19.739
Dean said he trippedand fell in.

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:21.828
we all knew it was him.

01:26:21.828 --> 01:26:23.265
He went to the can for it, actually,

01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:25.354
but he was out after two years.

01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:30.228
The case was
reopened in December '99.

01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:32.230
He was paroled
with support letters

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:35.102
from Colonel Leopold Stamper
and General Benjamin Tusk.

01:26:35.102 --> 01:26:37.279
Both men served
with Possey's father,

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:39.019
Sergeant Arthur Jules Possey,

01:26:39.019 --> 01:26:41.718
who was a shooting instructor
for the 75th Rangers.

01:26:41.718 --> 01:26:43.763
When he stepped down
as instructor,

01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:47.811
he remained the arsenal keeper
until he passed away in 2003.

01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:49.552
The prison psychiatrist wrote,

01:26:49.552 --> 01:26:51.684
"Awkward young man,
downcast gaze.

01:26:51.684 --> 01:26:53.947
Childhood head trauma:
gunshots."

01:26:53.947 --> 01:26:55.645
Three months later,

01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:57.299
"Extremely sensitive
to sound and light.

01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:59.214
"Unable to sleep.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.781
"Prefers solitary confinement
to general population.

01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:04.828
Applies for permanent transfer.
Denied."

01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:06.569
No credit card,
no home address,

01:27:06.569 --> 01:27:07.874
no Social Security.

01:27:07.874 --> 01:27:09.789
He's a ghost.

01:27:27.677 --> 01:27:30.288
You have
reached your destination.

01:27:32.943 --> 01:27:34.597
We have to call Mac.

01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:36.120
Not yet.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.774
Calling Mac
is calling the Bureau.

01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:39.384
They send tactical,

01:27:39.384 --> 01:27:41.473
they blow whatever lead
is waiting in there.

01:27:41.473 --> 01:27:43.170
What if he's in there?

01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:46.173
Then we're giving him
an extra hour to escape.

01:27:46.173 --> 01:27:48.132
He's a trained killer
with a stockpile of weapons.

01:27:48.132 --> 01:27:49.655
I am calling Mac right now.

01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:50.917
And erase us both
from the case?

01:27:50.917 --> 01:27:53.833
Just when we've cracked it?

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:56.488
No, Eleanor.
They put me down like a dog.

01:27:56.488 --> 01:27:58.490
Now, I'm gonna carry
that guy's head

01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:00.536
right into
the J. Edgar Hoover Building

01:28:00.536 --> 01:28:02.059
and write a bestseller
about it.

01:28:02.059 --> 01:28:03.408
Guess who's the protagonist.

01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:06.019
-  Fuck!

01:28:07.891 --> 01:28:09.458
No. Cool down.

01:28:11.024 --> 01:28:12.287
Fuck.

01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:15.594
Good evening, Mrs. Possey.

01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:19.250
You know who I am?

01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:20.991
I know what those plates mean.

01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:26.039
I haven't seen him
for a long time.

01:28:26.039 --> 01:28:27.432
Sorry.

01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:29.042
Arrest me or leave.

01:28:29.042 --> 01:28:31.044
I'm not helping you
kill my son.

01:28:31.044 --> 01:28:33.569
You can help us
catch him alive.

01:28:33.569 --> 01:28:36.311
That's no one else's priority.

01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:44.319
Last time he stepped by was...

01:28:45.842 --> 01:28:47.844
...during the virus.

01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:52.370
Everybody locked
in their houses.

01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:55.330
Dean was roaming free.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.594
A nomad king.

01:28:58.594 --> 01:29:02.380
I haven't seen him so happy
since he was a child.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:05.078
Is there anywhere else
he could be hiding?

01:29:05.078 --> 01:29:07.080
There's nowhere he couldn't.

01:29:08.778 --> 01:29:11.302
He used to stay in camps,
then parks.

01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:14.349
Then he started sleeping
in empty houses.

01:29:17.264 --> 01:29:20.224
I always knew that, um...

01:29:20.224 --> 01:29:23.488
he would eventually
get into trouble, but...

01:29:23.488 --> 01:29:25.969
I never expected
anything like this.

01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:28.928
Mrs. Possey, who shot him?

01:29:28.928 --> 01:29:30.887
We did.

01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:37.502
Dean was a great little kid.

01:29:37.502 --> 01:29:41.114
He was funny and smart.

01:29:41.114 --> 01:29:43.682
And always wanted to help,
so Arthur would send him

01:29:43.682 --> 01:29:46.293
out into the woods
to collect the targets.

01:29:47.294 --> 01:29:50.428
That day...

01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:52.735
he didn't realize
he was still out there.

01:29:57.348 --> 01:29:59.045
Bang.

01:29:59.045 --> 01:30:01.004
Two pellets
got him in the head.

01:30:02.658 --> 01:30:04.877
Six years old--
can you imagine?

01:30:04.877 --> 01:30:08.315
He was laid up
for almost a year.

01:30:08.315 --> 01:30:10.143
Nearly died.

01:30:10.143 --> 01:30:12.232
Now I wish he did.

01:30:14.496 --> 01:30:16.149
We never forgave each other.

01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:19.849
I blamed him for not checking.

01:30:19.849 --> 01:30:22.547
He blamed me
'cause it was my watch.

01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:26.725
We were both right.

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.947
Dean was never
the same after that.

01:30:30.947 --> 01:30:33.515
Still smart,
but he started hating school

01:30:33.515 --> 01:30:38.215
and birthday parties,
which he used to love.

01:30:38.215 --> 01:30:40.391
Kids can be cruel, you know.

01:30:40.391 --> 01:30:42.915
So your husband trained him
to defend himself?

01:30:42.915 --> 01:30:44.656
Not only.

01:30:44.656 --> 01:30:47.920
He wanted to give him
a future in the Army.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.619
And, uh...

01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:53.491
and Dean was talented.

01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:56.494
He just wasn't violent.

01:30:57.626 --> 01:30:59.497
Not back then.

01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:01.325
He liked to look
through the scope

01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:03.545
at insects and birds.

01:31:03.545 --> 01:31:06.199
He'd spend hours lying
in the grass with his rifle

01:31:06.199 --> 01:31:09.028
just looking at the moon.

01:31:09.028 --> 01:31:11.422
Not surprisingly,
they rejected him.

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:15.295
"Unfit for service."

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.476
That broke Arthur's heart.

01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:40.190
Sir...

01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:47.240
No, don't!

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:49.504
- He'll shoot you. Don't move.

01:31:51.244 --> 01:31:52.637
He'll kill you.

01:31:52.637 --> 01:31:54.770
He will kill you.

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:01.951
You said you could help.

01:32:01.951 --> 01:32:03.561
How?

01:32:04.606 --> 01:32:06.085
How?!

01:32:06.085 --> 01:32:08.610
You said that
you could keep him alive,

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.133
so what can you do?

01:32:15.878 --> 01:32:17.836
The horn was for him?

01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:19.229
Yes.

01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:21.797
- That means he trusts you.
- Yes.

01:32:23.625 --> 01:32:26.366
Here's what you're gonna do.

01:32:26.366 --> 01:32:27.977
Come get my phone.

01:32:27.977 --> 01:32:29.369
Get my gun.

01:32:37.726 --> 01:32:39.031
Get his, too.

01:33:06.668 --> 01:33:08.583
Dean!

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.411
- She's here to help!

01:33:12.499 --> 01:33:14.501
She says she's off the case.

01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:16.503
No one knows they're here.

01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:20.551
I believe her, and I think
that you should, too.

01:33:20.551 --> 01:33:24.599
With your medical history,
she can keep you out of jail.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.644
You'd be going to Dalloway.

01:33:26.644 --> 01:33:28.777
It's a facility in the woods.

01:33:33.999 --> 01:33:35.566
I mean, Dean, come on.

01:33:35.566 --> 01:33:36.959
It's got to stop.

01:33:36.959 --> 01:33:39.570
Look what you've done.

01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:41.833
You must surrender.

01:33:56.108 --> 01:33:57.588
Son?

01:33:58.981 --> 01:34:01.374
If you won't go with them...

01:34:03.159 --> 01:34:05.161
...come with me.

01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:24.702
ELEANOR [voice trembling]:
Oh, God. Oh, fuck.

01:34:24.702 --> 01:34:26.965
Oh, fuck.

01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:00.885
I always thought
I'd die before her.

01:36:03.801 --> 01:36:06.238
L-Listen, Dean.

01:36:06.238 --> 01:36:08.371
- My name is Eleanor.
- Don't.

01:36:08.371 --> 01:36:10.547
Don't do that.
Don't use your bullshit

01:36:10.547 --> 01:36:12.375
police academy
tactics training on me.

01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:14.072
I'm not that guy.

01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:17.249
I'm not some drugged-out nutjob

01:36:17.249 --> 01:36:19.425
you can stall
by agreeing with me

01:36:19.425 --> 01:36:22.254
and using my first name
like we're neighbors.

01:36:22.254 --> 01:36:24.822
You came here to kill me,
not to borrow a cup of sugar.

01:36:24.822 --> 01:36:26.606
So don't tell me
you care for me,

01:36:26.606 --> 01:36:28.826
'cause I can see
that you don't.

01:36:28.826 --> 01:36:30.654
Your one chance
at a painless release

01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:32.917
is not to lie
like everybody else.

01:36:35.615 --> 01:36:37.966
Well, you're wrong.

01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:41.839
They brought me in because they
thought I'd understand you.

01:36:41.839 --> 01:36:44.711
- That I could empathize.
- Finally.

01:36:44.711 --> 01:36:48.846
I kill 200 people,
then someone gives a shit.

01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:50.761
You making any progress?

01:36:50.761 --> 01:36:52.371
Well, I'm here.

01:36:54.504 --> 01:36:56.593
And I'm not afraid of dying.

01:36:56.593 --> 01:37:01.467
Sometimes I hate myself
so much that I want to die.

01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:03.600
And sometimes I think
it'd be a lot easier

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.428
to love myself more

01:37:05.428 --> 01:37:07.778
if everyone else
was blown off the map.

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:11.303
But they won't be.

01:37:13.131 --> 01:37:16.439
This doesn't hurt, Dean.

01:37:16.439 --> 01:37:18.310
You are entertainment.

01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:19.877
You're time on screen.

01:37:19.877 --> 01:37:22.227
They measure you in clicks.

01:37:23.315 --> 01:37:25.230
And they want more.

01:37:25.230 --> 01:37:28.277
More action, more blood.

01:37:28.277 --> 01:37:30.192
Change the narrative.
Go to jail.

01:37:30.192 --> 01:37:32.672
Just if you can
explain to everyone

01:37:32.672 --> 01:37:34.370
why it made sense to you

01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:36.676
to grab a weapon
and start shooting people...

01:37:36.676 --> 01:37:38.287
What doesn't make sense
about it?

01:37:38.287 --> 01:37:41.725
People make so much noise.

01:37:41.725 --> 01:37:44.119
Year after year, shouting
at some stupid fireworks,

01:37:44.119 --> 01:37:46.904
as if silence and darkness
were enemies to defeat.

01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:49.428
Go back to your fucking caves.

01:37:51.604 --> 01:37:53.563
At night, there are
so many lights on

01:37:53.563 --> 01:37:55.652
you can't even see the stars.

01:37:57.001 --> 01:38:01.092
I want time. I want space.

01:38:01.092 --> 01:38:03.921
They want things.

01:38:03.921 --> 01:38:06.837
Fuck them.

01:38:06.837 --> 01:38:09.187
You've either got to be
very stupid or very asleep

01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:11.233
to find this game entertaining.

01:38:11.233 --> 01:38:12.930
People scrubbing,

01:38:12.930 --> 01:38:15.498
cleaning up other people's shit
for 12 hours a day

01:38:15.498 --> 01:38:17.065
for a handful of green paper?

01:38:17.065 --> 01:38:18.936
Not me.

01:38:18.936 --> 01:38:20.633
Not anymore.

01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:26.552
Believe me, I, um... I know
what you're talking about.

01:38:29.164 --> 01:38:31.949
I just wish
we'd had this conversation

01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:33.864
before you crossed the line.

01:38:40.958 --> 01:38:44.396
I went to
the slaughterhouse today.

01:38:44.396 --> 01:38:47.573
There was a woman, Ramona.

01:38:47.573 --> 01:38:50.533
She seemed fond of you.

01:38:50.533 --> 01:38:52.100
Yeah.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:54.406
She wasn't bad.

01:38:54.406 --> 01:38:57.148
That place, though...

01:38:58.367 --> 01:39:01.065
One morning,
after an all-nighter,

01:39:01.065 --> 01:39:03.981
I traced the cow's path backwards.

01:39:03.981 --> 01:39:07.202
Started in the burger section,
went through cutting,

01:39:07.202 --> 01:39:11.423
saw the cows getting skinned
and cut in two,

01:39:11.423 --> 01:39:14.165
then the cows getting
the bolt to the head.

01:39:14.165 --> 01:39:17.777
Then I followed a truck
back to the farm.

01:39:17.777 --> 01:39:20.737
Jumped a fence,

01:39:20.737 --> 01:39:22.957
walked around the lake,
and there they were.

01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:27.135
Magnificent.

01:39:27.135 --> 01:39:30.834
They seemed grateful
for their existence.

01:39:32.096 --> 01:39:34.272
They didn't want to change.

01:39:34.272 --> 01:39:36.753
Didn't want to evolve.

01:39:36.753 --> 01:39:40.931
They just wanted to be there, breathing.

01:39:40.931 --> 01:39:43.020
To live and die,

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.370
then dissipate
back into the whole.

01:39:47.416 --> 01:39:49.374
Isn't that what we all want?

01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:54.901
Why don't you just go away?

01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:56.816
I'm sure there's a place
you can go live

01:39:56.816 --> 01:39:58.688
like the cows out on the farm.

01:39:58.688 --> 01:40:00.211
Nah.

01:40:01.952 --> 01:40:05.303
Everywhere you go
belongs to someone.

01:40:05.303 --> 01:40:07.044
Everywhere you go,
you got to have money.

01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:08.698
They-they got to know
who you are.

01:40:08.698 --> 01:40:11.962
They... they're always
checking up on you.

01:40:11.962 --> 01:40:13.833
They're always asking.

01:40:13.833 --> 01:40:15.661
They're always watching.

01:40:15.661 --> 01:40:18.360
Now they got drones,

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.233
satellites spying
from outer space.

01:40:22.233 --> 01:40:24.540
This whole planet's
a fucking prison.

01:40:25.932 --> 01:40:28.022
Why do I have to play
by your rules?

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:30.981
I don't know how to make money.

01:40:30.981 --> 01:40:33.549
I don't know
how to win votes.

01:40:34.724 --> 01:40:37.248
But who has the real power?

01:40:37.248 --> 01:40:39.946
Life and death
from a thousand feet away.

01:40:41.818 --> 01:40:46.605
I may not find peace,
but I can deliver retribution.

01:40:49.608 --> 01:40:51.697
Retribution is not
what you need.

01:40:51.697 --> 01:40:53.786
What, then?

01:40:53.786 --> 01:40:55.223
Love?

01:40:55.223 --> 01:40:58.095
Yes.

01:40:58.095 --> 01:40:59.879
Some of us have been
so mistreated

01:40:59.879 --> 01:41:03.274
we don't even know whatit's lik.

01:41:03.274 --> 01:41:06.190
They burned
our bridges to pleasure.

01:41:06.190 --> 01:41:08.279
But I think
they can be rebuilt.

01:41:09.237 --> 01:41:11.587
Nah.

01:41:11.587 --> 01:41:13.284
Too late for me.

01:41:14.285 --> 01:41:16.070
That train's gone.

01:41:17.506 --> 01:41:19.203
I appreciate the effort, though.

01:41:20.465 --> 01:41:22.946
Don't worry. There's no next.

01:41:22.946 --> 01:41:25.122
You're still alive
for a reason.

01:41:25.122 --> 01:41:28.517
You said you wanted to help me,
well, this is how.

01:41:28.517 --> 01:41:29.909
I want to go over there.

01:41:29.909 --> 01:41:32.347
I want to lay down next to her.

01:41:32.347 --> 01:41:34.653
I want to hug her
like when I was a kid.

01:41:34.653 --> 01:41:36.481
And you're gonna wait
till I fall asleep.

01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:38.614
I'm real tired. It'll be quick.

01:41:38.614 --> 01:41:41.530
Then you're gonna
shoot me in the head.

01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:43.836
I don't want my corpse
all over the news.

01:41:43.836 --> 01:41:45.664
So you take that can
of gasoline,

01:41:45.664 --> 01:41:48.972
you pour it over us
and set us on fire.

01:41:48.972 --> 01:41:51.061
When the barbecue's done,

01:41:51.061 --> 01:41:54.282
you call your friends
and you pick up your trophy.

01:41:54.282 --> 01:41:56.327
That a deal?

01:41:56.327 --> 01:41:58.242
Eleanor?

01:42:01.463 --> 01:42:03.595
Yes, Dean.

01:42:03.595 --> 01:42:06.294
I'd kindly and respectfully
execute you.

01:42:12.256 --> 01:42:14.128
You think I'm stupid?

01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.825
No. Dean.

01:43:10.314 --> 01:43:12.447
Don't. Dean!

01:43:12.447 --> 01:43:14.579
Stop!

01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:19.018
Help! Help!

01:43:19.018 --> 01:43:21.934
Mrs. Possey, open the door.

01:43:21.934 --> 01:43:23.109
Dean!

01:43:24.154 --> 01:43:28.202
Stop! Dean, I'm not wired.

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:29.942
Someone must have heard
the shots.

01:43:29.942 --> 01:43:32.162
I'm not wired!

01:43:32.162 --> 01:43:34.077
Mrs. Possey, police.

01:43:34.077 --> 01:43:37.820
Dean, stop!

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.474
Listen to me!

01:43:50.789 --> 01:43:52.661
ELEANOR [muffled]:
Dean!

01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.971
Fuck.

01:44:05.369 --> 01:44:07.589
Shots fired!
Shots fired from the shed!

01:44:08.981 --> 01:44:10.983
Dean!

01:44:10.983 --> 01:44:12.550
Why?

01:44:14.422 --> 01:44:17.555
Some kid just lost their father
all 'cause you're conflicted?

01:44:18.817 --> 01:44:21.864
Dean, you have to stop.

01:44:35.399 --> 01:44:37.662
These people have families.

01:44:37.662 --> 01:44:39.708
You are giving them decades
of suffering

01:44:39.708 --> 01:44:41.710
while everything you hate
stays the same.

01:44:48.543 --> 01:44:49.935
Fuck!

01:44:59.815 --> 01:45:01.904
I know you're listening to me.

01:45:01.904 --> 01:45:03.471
Kill me if you're not.

01:45:04.907 --> 01:45:07.344
You're the one
who wants to stop.

01:45:07.344 --> 01:45:10.347
Five minutes ago, you asked me

01:45:10.347 --> 01:45:13.959
to shoot you in the head
and burn your body.

01:45:13.959 --> 01:45:15.787
That proves how tired you are

01:45:15.787 --> 01:45:18.312
and how unnecessary
all of this is.

01:45:19.878 --> 01:45:20.923
Look at me!

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:28.322
Mr. Possey, you're surrounded!

01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:32.064
Get out of the shed right now
with your arms raised!

01:45:32.064 --> 01:45:34.371
You said it was over.

01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:36.330
Untie me,
and let me handle them.

01:45:36.330 --> 01:45:38.157
You know I'll do
what's best for you.

01:45:38.157 --> 01:45:40.638
Mr. Possey,

01:45:40.638 --> 01:45:43.728
I want you to walk
out of there right now,

01:45:43.728 --> 01:45:46.383
and I want you
to do it slowly, okay?

01:45:46.383 --> 01:45:49.081
Come the fuck out, asshole!

01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:51.736
Dean.

01:45:51.736 --> 01:45:54.260
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.610
My boss's car.

01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:57.394
By now, they know I'm here.

01:45:57.394 --> 01:45:59.265
If they know I'm alive,
then they won't fire.

01:45:59.265 --> 01:46:01.746
Come out, motherfucker!

01:46:01.746 --> 01:46:02.921
Dean. Dean.

01:46:02.921 --> 01:46:06.185
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:46:06.185 --> 01:46:08.100
The minute that you get booked,

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:10.755
I will make sure that
you get the help you need.

01:46:10.755 --> 01:46:12.104
Medication.

01:46:12.104 --> 01:46:13.715
That shit works.

01:46:13.715 --> 01:46:15.412
You'll sleep like a baby.

01:46:15.412 --> 01:46:17.109
And when you open
your eyes again, I will be

01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:18.850
right there to help you
get through this.

01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:20.678
I'm gonna give you
to the count of five.

01:46:20.678 --> 01:46:22.724
Dean, Dean, you don't
have to untie me,

01:46:22.724 --> 01:46:25.074
but just stay like this.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:46:25.074 --> 01:46:27.119
Four!

01:46:28.077 --> 01:46:30.035
Put that down, please.

01:46:30.035 --> 01:46:31.385
Three!

01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:36.912
- Get out!
- Two!

01:46:36.912 --> 01:46:40.698
Dean, put that down,
or you have to kill yourself.

01:46:40.698 --> 01:46:42.134
One!

01:46:42.134 --> 01:46:44.310
I'm sorry, but you have to.
Do it!

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.357
Time's up, asshole!

01:47:59.168 --> 01:48:00.691
- Stay right where you are!

01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:02.388
- Show me your hands!
- Don't fucking move!

01:48:02.388 --> 01:48:04.042
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:48:04.042 --> 01:48:06.218
Hold! Hold!

01:48:06.218 --> 01:48:08.133
He's alive.
Eleanor?

01:48:08.133 --> 01:48:10.048
He's wounded, but he's alive.

01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:13.704
What the hell happened?

01:48:13.704 --> 01:48:15.184
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried. I really tried.

01:48:15.184 --> 01:48:16.490
- What?
- Lammark wouldn't let me.

01:48:23.322 --> 01:48:25.194
- OFFICER [over radio]:
- All units,.

01:48:25.194 --> 01:48:26.848
We need more men on the ground.

01:48:33.028 --> 01:48:34.986
OFFICER [over radio]: They
traversed out to the river.

01:48:34.986 --> 01:48:37.380
- Distribute weapons and vests.
Copy that.

01:48:40.992 --> 01:48:42.603
OFFICER [over radio]:
Chopper unit, stand by.

01:49:07.236 --> 01:49:09.630
Canine team, looks
like we picked up a scent.

01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:11.501
Copy that.
What's your location?

01:49:11.501 --> 01:49:13.938
We're in sector nine,
heading south.

01:49:15.374 --> 01:49:17.115
We have footprints.

01:49:18.856 --> 01:49:20.728
Copy that.
Rerouting all mobile units.

01:49:20.728 --> 01:49:22.860
Sector nine, factory site.

01:50:49.947 --> 01:50:51.601
Eleanor, we went through
your debriefing,

01:50:51.601 --> 01:50:53.342
and we came up
with this strategy.

01:50:53.342 --> 01:50:55.910
Collectively.

01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:59.348
We hope you'll be happy
to sign.

01:50:59.348 --> 01:51:01.829
The entire operation
will remain classified.

01:51:01.829 --> 01:51:03.613
As far as
the record's concerned,

01:51:03.613 --> 01:51:05.833
this was an authorized plan.

01:51:05.833 --> 01:51:08.574
BPD and the Bureau cracked
the case, got our killer,

01:51:08.574 --> 01:51:10.576
with the state government's
full support.

01:51:10.576 --> 01:51:11.839
Period.

01:51:11.839 --> 01:51:14.319
Not a word about
what happened in that house,

01:51:14.319 --> 01:51:16.582
not a word
of your history with drugs.

01:51:16.582 --> 01:51:19.934
However,
despite your previous record,

01:51:19.934 --> 01:51:22.066
we all agreed that you've
more than proved yourself,

01:51:22.066 --> 01:51:25.679
so the Bureau would like
to offer you a permanent post

01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:27.724
as intelligence analyst.

01:51:32.773 --> 01:51:35.036
Is this your way
of buying my silence?

01:51:36.428 --> 01:51:38.561
You really expect me
to help cover up

01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:40.694
your incompetence,
your lack of judgment,

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:42.608
your willingness
to put lives at risk?

01:51:42.608 --> 01:51:44.828
He's trying
to help you, Eleanor.

01:51:44.828 --> 01:51:46.351
You were suspended.

01:51:46.351 --> 01:51:48.571
Lammark had been fired.

01:51:48.571 --> 01:51:51.487
But still,
you illegally contacted Lang,

01:51:51.487 --> 01:51:53.576
interrogated him
without a lawyer

01:51:53.576 --> 01:51:55.317
and set off
without authorization,

01:51:55.317 --> 01:51:58.712
leading directly
to 17 extra fatalities.

01:51:58.712 --> 01:52:00.757
So, instead of letting
the press make you a hero

01:52:00.757 --> 01:52:04.065
for 15 minutes,
then destroying your life,

01:52:04.065 --> 01:52:06.981
we're offering you
a way forward.

01:52:18.819 --> 01:52:20.690
I want you to honor Lammark

01:52:20.690 --> 01:52:23.911
with a posthumous
Medal of Valor.

01:52:23.911 --> 01:52:27.001
And I want you to transfer his
full pension to his husband.

01:52:29.307 --> 01:52:31.179
We can do that.

01:52:32.833 --> 01:52:35.313
I don't want to be an analyst.

01:52:35.313 --> 01:52:37.446
Make me special agent.
You know I deserve it.

01:52:41.102 --> 01:52:42.973
Done.

01:52:42.973 --> 01:52:45.715
Any tricks, now or later,
and I will let everyone know

01:52:45.715 --> 01:52:47.848
that you have blood
on your hands.

01:53:01.296 --> 01:53:03.951
Thanks, Eleanor.

01:53:03.951 --> 01:53:06.214
I'm glad
we understand each other.

01:53:09.304 --> 01:53:11.001
We don't.

01:53:22.143 --> 01:53:24.710
Good work, Falco.

01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:26.190
Thank you, sir.

01:54:04.011 --> 01:54:05.839
LAMMARK [voice-over]:
We get this guy,

01:54:05.839 --> 01:54:07.971
this all goes away,

01:54:07.971 --> 01:54:12.019
and we can both do the job
we were meant to.
