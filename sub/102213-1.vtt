A dystopian world.

When our land was whole,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.845
and we lived harmoniously
alongside...

02:09.296 --> 02:11.131
That's when
the Mighty Sisudatu,

02:11.340 --> 02:12.674
the last dragon,

concentrated all her magic

All that was left of Sisu
was her gem.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.077
It should have been
this big inspirational moment,

02:40.244 --> 02:42.579
where humanity united
over her sacrifice.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.791
But instead,
people being people,

02:45.958 --> 02:47.835
they all fought to possess

02:47.918 --> 02:50.212
the last remnant
of dragon magic.

1:36:11.939 --> 1:36:13.315

1:36:13.774 --> 1:36:15.275
When you're broken

1:36:15.359 --> 1:36:17.986
Open up your heart and feel

1:36:18.070 --> 1:36:22.574
There's no difference
We're all family here

1:36:23.116 --> 1:36:25.452

1:36:25.536 --> 1:36:27.788
All our up and downs

1:36:27.871 --> 1:36:33.085
There's never really
anything to fear

1:36:33.585 --> 1:36:35.796
There's an energy
in the water

1:36:35.879 --> 1:36:37.965
There is magic
deep in our heart

1:36:38.048 --> 1:36:40.551
There's a legacy
that we honor

1:36:40.634 --> 1:36:43.178
When we bring the light
to the dark

1:36:43.262 --> 1:36:45.514
Whatever brings us together

1:36:45.597 --> 1:36:47.766
Can never tear us apart

1:36:47.850 --> 1:36:50.269
We become stronger than ever

1:36:50.352 --> 1:36:52.104

1:37:22.968 --> 1:37:25.429
I see you as myself

1:37:25.512 --> 1:37:30.184
Nothing we can't do

1:37:30.267 --> 1:37:32.769
Put the past behind

1:37:32.853 --> 1:37:35.105
Learn from life this time

1:37:35.189 --> 1:37:40.110
We can start brand new

1:37:40.194 --> 1:37:42.571
