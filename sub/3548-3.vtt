WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.775
BREE DISCOVERED
A FAMILY SECRET.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.237
OH, I'M GONNA BE SICK.

00:06.237 --> 00:08.409
LYNETTE STRUGGLED
WITH CHEMOTHERAPY...

00:08.409 --> 00:09.680
(Lynette retching)

00:09.680 --> 00:12.483
WHILE SUSAN TOOK JOY
IN BEING PREGNANT...

00:12.483 --> 00:14.745
I'M EATING FOR TWO.

00:14.745 --> 00:18.018
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE
TO CARLOS AND GABY...

00:18.018 --> 00:20.451
THE I.R.S. COULD MAKE ME
TESTIFY AGAINST YOU.

00:20.451 --> 00:23.694
WAS THE PROMISE EDIE FORCED
CARLOS TO MAKE.
 WE'RE ENGAGED.

00:23.694 --> 00:26.057
I REALLY DID CARE FOR EDIE,

00:26.057 --> 00:29.200
BUT I CAN'T LET HER
RUIN MY LIFE.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.162
(boy) TREVOR! OVER HERE!

00:32.162 --> 00:35.806
(Mary Alice) ALL CHILDREN
LOVE TO PLAY GAMES.

00:35.806 --> 00:38.209
BUT BEFORE
THEY CAN RACE THEIR BIKES

00:38.209 --> 00:40.641
OR JUMP THEIR ROPES

00:40.641 --> 00:43.144
OR TOSS THEIR FRISBEES,

00:43.144 --> 00:46.547
CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THEY MUST
FIRST CONVINCE THEIR FRIENDS

00:46.547 --> 00:48.549
TO PLAY ALONG WITH THEM.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.582
THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ADULTS.

00:51.582 --> 00:53.084
HI, GABY. IT'S ME.

00:53.084 --> 00:55.086
I'M THROWING A PARTY
SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:55.086 --> 00:56.587
GUESS WHAT KIND?

00:56.587 --> 00:58.589
A CHARADES PARTY?

00:58.589 --> 01:02.233
Didn't you just throw one?
 NO, THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.

01:02.233 --> 01:05.336
OH. RIGHT. GUESS IT'S TIME
FOR ANOTHER ONE.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.098
SURE IS. CAN YOU COME?

01:07.098 --> 01:08.599
UM... SORRY.

01:08.599 --> 01:12.243
VICTOR NEEDS ME
AT THIS... POLITICAL THING.

01:12.243 --> 01:13.844
DAMN. DAMN, DAMN.

01:13.844 --> 01:15.606
AW! YOU HAVE TO COME.

01:15.606 --> 01:18.149
YOU'RE THE BEST
CHARADES PLAYER I KNOW.

01:18.149 --> 01:21.081
THAT'S SWEET..
AND TOTALLY ACCURATE.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.384
BUT I'M REALLY WHIPPED
FROM THE CHEMO, SO...

01:23.384 --> 01:25.456
(call waiting beeps)
 OH, THERE'S MY OTHER LINE.

01:25.456 --> 01:28.459
CAN YOU ASK ME NEXT TIME,
OKAY, HON? OKAY, BYE.

01:28.459 --> 01:30.090
(beep)

01:30.090 --> 01:31.422
HELLO?

01:31.422 --> 01:34.365
OH, HEY, BREE.
MM, WHAT'S UP?

01:34.365 --> 01:37.368
WELL, I STOPPED BY KATHERINE'S
LAST NIGHT JUST TO GET A RECIPE,

01:37.368 --> 01:39.630
AND YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT I OVERHEARD.

01:39.630 --> 01:42.102
SHE SLAPPED HER KID?! NO!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.674
Yes, and get this--

01:43.674 --> 01:46.677
WHEN ADAM SAID DYLAN WAS JUST
GOING TO KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS,

01:46.677 --> 01:48.679
KATHERINE SAID--
AND I QUOTE--

01:48.679 --> 01:51.682
"WELL, WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO FIND BETTER LIES."
 (call waiting beeps)

01:51.682 --> 01:54.685
QOH, HANG ON.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER CALL.
 Don't answer it!

01:54.685 --> 01:57.548
IT'S SUSAN. SHE'S HOSTING
ANOTHER GAME NIGHT.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.351
ANOTHER ONE? IT'S TIME
FOR AN ANONYMOUS LETTER.

02:00.351 --> 02:04.155
WAIT--IS KATHERINE GOING
TO SUSAN'S CHARADE NIGHT?

02:04.155 --> 02:05.456
PROBABLY. WHY?

02:05.456 --> 02:07.158
We should go, too.

02:07.158 --> 02:10.360
GET A FEW DRINKS IN HER,
SEE IF SHE LOOSENS UP.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.363
WELL, I DOUBT
A WOMAN LIKE KATHERINE

02:12.363 --> 02:14.205
IS GONNA SPILL HER SECRETS

02:14.205 --> 02:16.537
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S HAD A LITTLE WINE.
 I DON'T KNOW.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.539
YOU CAME OUT WITH
SOME INTERESTING THINGS

02:18.539 --> 02:21.242
BEFORE YOU SWORE OFF
THE SAUCE.
 WELL, NONE THAT I RECALL.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.544
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU LOST YOUR VIRGINITY

02:23.544 --> 02:27.147
in the backseat of a--
 POINT WELL TAKEN.
I'LL BRING THE WINE.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.619
SUSAN, GOOD NEWS.

02:28.619 --> 02:31.282
WE CAN COME TO THE PARTY
AFTER ALL.

02:31.282 --> 02:33.584
HEY, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
YOU SHOULD INVITE?

02:33.584 --> 02:37.328
YEAH, I AM FEELING MUCH BETTER,
SO COUNT ME IN.

02:37.328 --> 02:39.330
WILL OUR NEW NEIGHBOR
BE COMING?

02:39.330 --> 02:41.762
OF COURSE!
I LOVE YOUR CHARADES PARTIES.

02:41.762 --> 02:45.536
AND I HOPE YOU'RE INVITING THAT
DELIGHTFUL KATHERINE MAYFAIR.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.901
SO YOU WERE PAID
A VERY NICE COMPLIMENT TODAY.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.743
I WAS?
 YES.

02:52.743 --> 02:54.745
I AM HOSTING
A CHARADES PARTY,

02:54.745 --> 02:56.747
AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS
WENT OUT THEIR WAY

02:56.747 --> 02:59.350
TO INSIST I INVITE YOU.
 REALLY?

02:59.350 --> 03:01.282
MM-HMM.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.515
YES, NOT ALL ADULTS
LIKE TO PLAY GAMES.

03:04.515 --> 03:08.519
BUT THE ONES WHO DO...

03:08.519 --> 03:22.833
PLAY TO WIN.

03:22.833 --> 03:26.377
STELLA WINGFIELD HATED TO COOK.

03:26.377 --> 03:28.479
STILL, SHE SPENT
THAT FRIDAY MORNING

03:28.479 --> 03:30.381
GRATING CHEESE...

03:30.381 --> 03:33.244
AND GREASING A PAN...

03:33.244 --> 03:36.447
AND LAYING IN MACARONI

03:36.447 --> 03:40.291
BECAUSE HER ELDEST DAUGHTER
WAS SICK,

03:40.291 --> 03:43.954
AND STELLA COULD NO LONGER
SIT BY AND DO NOTHING.

03:43.954 --> 03:45.296
LUNCHTIME!

03:45.296 --> 03:47.398
OH. NO, THANKS.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.260
OH, COME ON.
I MADE IT FOR YOU SPECIAL.

03:49.260 --> 03:51.262
YOU'VE GOTTA
KEEP YOUR STRENGTH UP.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.933
I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.436
BUT I TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T KEEP ANYTHING DOWN,

03:55.436 --> 03:58.469
AND F.Y.I., MAC AND CHEESE
IS HALFWAY TO VOMIT.

03:58.469 --> 04:01.542
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE GIVEN ME
A PLATE OF CREAMED CORN.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.244
AREN'T YOU TAKING
THE ANTI-NAUSEA DRUG?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.716
YEAH, I AM TAKING IT.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.718
IT'S JUST... NOT WORKING.
(chuckles)

04:07.718 --> 04:10.281
OH. WELL, UM...

04:10.281 --> 04:13.253
I KNOW SOMETHING THAT MIGHT
HELP YOUR NAUSEA

04:13.253 --> 04:15.556
ANDBOOST YOUR APPETITE.

04:15.556 --> 04:20.761
UM... PERHAPS A LITTLE VISIT
FROM MY OLD FRIEND...

04:20.761 --> 04:22.433
MARY JANE?

04:24.034 --> 04:25.836
YOU'RE SUGGESTING POT?

04:25.836 --> 04:28.839
A LOT OF CHEMO PATIENTS
USE IT. HELL, I DID.

04:28.839 --> 04:29.870
YEAH.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.002
OH, COME ON.

04:32.002 --> 04:35.346
LET MAMA SCORE YOU
SOME KICK-ASS CHRONIC.

04:35.346 --> 04:38.509
"KICK-ASS CHRONIC"?

04:38.509 --> 04:39.880
UH-HUH.
YOU'RE A GRANDMOTHER.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.383
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OFF SOMEWHERE
KNITTING AN AFGHAN?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.555
JUST TRYING
TO EASE YOUR PAIN.

04:44.555 --> 04:47.287
WELL, THANKS,

04:47.287 --> 04:49.289
BUT I PREFER
NOT TO GET MY MEDICATION

04:49.289 --> 04:51.492
FROM SOME GUY
UNDER A BRIDGE.

04:55.326 --> 04:56.827
SUIT YOURSELF.

05:03.834 --> 05:06.807
HEY.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.339
WHAT'S THIS?

05:08.339 --> 05:10.310
A CRIB.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.813
OH, AND LOOK...

05:12.813 --> 05:14.345
SAFETY LATCH.

05:14.345 --> 05:16.347
I FIGURED IF THE BABY
TAKES AFTER YOU,

05:16.347 --> 05:17.848
"ACCIDENT-PROOF" IS KEY.

05:17.848 --> 05:19.920
HONEY, YOU KNOW, I'M STILL
IN MY FIRST TRIMESTER.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.092
UM, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY

05:22.092 --> 05:23.594
TO BE MAKING CRIBS?

05:23.594 --> 05:25.926
EARLY WOULD BE
PAINTING IT PINK OR BLUE.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.928
BUT...

05:27.928 --> 05:30.761
I GOT BOTH,
SO WE'RE COVERED EITHER WAY.

05:30.761 --> 05:33.333
(chuckles) GREAT.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.367
AND WHETHER
IT'S A BOY OR A GIRL,

05:36.367 --> 05:38.639
COLTS FAN.
 THAT'SNON-NEGOTIABLE.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.970
MM.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.943
UM, BREE'S HOME.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:45.816 --> 05:47.778
(clears throat)

05:47.778 --> 05:49.450
LOOK SHARP. IT'S SUSAN.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.452
GOD, IT'S GETTING
HARDER AND HARDER

05:51.452 --> 05:53.454
TO KEEP HER
AT ARM'S LENGTH.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.456
I NEVER KNEW
SHE WAS SUCH A HUGGER.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.459
YOU WANT ME
TO RUN INTERFERENCE?
 NO, NO.
I'M GETTING GOOD AT PROPS.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.660
YEAH? GOOD.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.892
HEY, SUSAN! WHAT'S UP?

06:01.892 --> 06:03.464
I NEED A FAVOR.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.765
UM, I REMEMBER YOU
MENTIONING

06:04.765 --> 06:06.467
THAT YOU LIKED
YOUR OBSTETRICIAN.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.469
CAN I GET HIS NUMBER?

06:08.469 --> 06:10.771
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE USING DR. MAYFAIR.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.373
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE WEIRD.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.375
YOU KNOW,
ADAM IS MY NEIGHBOR.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.878
BUT YOU DON'T MIND
ORSON BEING YOUR DENTIST.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.880
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I DON'T BLUSH

06:19.880 --> 06:22.413
WHEN ORSON SAYS,
"OPEN WIDE." (chuckles)

06:22.413 --> 06:25.416
YOU KNOW, MY O.B.
IS ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.518
YOU JUST DO NOT WANT
TO DRIVE THAT FAR.

06:27.518 --> 06:29.520
OH, WELL, WE COULD SCHEDULE
OUR APPOINTMENTS TOGETHER

06:29.520 --> 06:30.621
AND CARPOOL.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.623
YOU KNOW... (chuckles)
PREGNANT GALS ON THE ROAD.

06:32.623 --> 06:34.495
(laughs) IT DOES SOUND FUN,

06:34.495 --> 06:37.728
BUT I DON'T THINK MY DOCTOR'S
TAKING ON ANY NEW PATIENTS.

06:37.728 --> 06:40.731
OH, I CAN TALK HIM INTO IT.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

06:40.731 --> 06:42.503
I, UM...

06:42.503 --> 06:44.435
DON'T REMEMBER.

06:44.435 --> 06:46.106
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.909
NO. YOU KNOW, I USUALLY
JUST CALL HIM "DOCTOR."

06:48.909 --> 06:51.582
(laughs) BREE,
JUST GET ME THE NUMBER.

07:06.196 --> 07:07.528
OOH. (laughs)

07:07.528 --> 07:10.030
HERE YOU GO, BUT PLEASE
DON'T MENTION MY NAME.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.032
AS I SAID, YOU KNOW,
HE'S OVERBOOKED,

07:12.032 --> 07:15.035
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GET ON HIS BAD SIDE.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.669
I'M SO EXCITED. PREGNANT GALS
SHARING A DOCTOR! (laughs)

07:18.669 --> 07:20.070
(gasps)

07:20.070 --> 07:21.441
AH-CHOO!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.944
OH, BLESS YOU.
 OH! SORRY,
PROBABLY JUST ALLERGIES,

07:23.944 --> 07:27.177
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.

07:27.177 --> 07:28.979
(muffled) RIGHT.

07:35.926 --> 07:37.457
HEY.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.560
CAN I GET A DRINK?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.061
YEAH, SURE.

07:46.637 --> 07:50.100
BY THE WAY,
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.572
OH, THANKS.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.843
ANYTIME.

07:59.810 --> 08:02.583
I'D SAY
THE CAR IS CLEAN ENOUGH.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.654
KATHERINE.

08:03.654 --> 08:07.057
YOU TWO SEEMED AWFULLY FRIENDLY.
DO YOU KNOW HER?

08:07.057 --> 08:10.861
NO. WE SAID TWO WORDS.
SHE CRITICIZED MY CAR WASHING.
 HMM. IT'S FUNNY.

08:10.861 --> 08:13.994
WHEN I CRITICIZE YOU, YOU DON'T
PUT ON A BIG, GOOFY GRIN.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.996
YOU REALLY NEED
TO STOP THIS.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.999
GIVEN OUR HISTORY, SHOULDN'T I
BE SAYING THAT TO YOU?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.001
KATHERINE, I CAN'T
JUST NOT SPEAK TO WOMEN.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.704
I'M A GYNECOLOGIST,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.577
YES, I KNOW.

08:26.577 --> 08:29.710
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING
YOUR WORK HOME WITH YOU.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.612
(car door shuts)

08:39.919 --> 08:42.823
YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

08:42.823 --> 08:46.927
AH, EDIE ASKED ME TO HELP HER
PICK OUT A GIFT FOR HER SISTER,

08:46.927 --> 08:49.630
SO I GOTTA
SWING BY THE MALL.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.632
WHEN CAN I SEE YOU NEXT?

08:51.632 --> 08:54.565
WELL, VICTOR HAS
A TEACHERS' UNION THING

08:54.565 --> 08:55.906
ON THURSDAY.

08:55.906 --> 08:58.538
GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
ON THURSDAY.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.711
CARLOS,
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

09:00.711 --> 09:04.915
I MEAN, WITH US. WHY ARE WE
STILL SNEAKING AROUND?

09:04.915 --> 09:07.017
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY.

09:07.017 --> 09:10.020
OH, COME ON. EDIE'S RECOVERED
FROM HER LITTLE SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.023
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON?
 I'VE GOT SOME THINGS GOING ON,

09:13.023 --> 09:16.286
AND I NEED THEM TO PAY OFF
BEFORE I CAN MAKE A MOVE.

09:16.286 --> 09:18.288
REALLY,
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

09:18.288 --> 09:20.290
OKAY, BUT IF YOU DID
HAVE A CHOICE,

09:20.290 --> 09:22.292
WOULD IT BE A HARD ONE?

09:22.292 --> 09:26.296
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH EDIE, IS IT?
 NO, I DON'T LOVE EDIE.

09:26.296 --> 09:29.299
AND I'VE GOT A PLAN TO GET HER
OUT OF MY LIFE FOREVER.

09:29.299 --> 09:31.842
JUST GIVE ME TWO WEEKS, OKAY?

09:33.343 --> 09:35.706
A BRACELET'S ALWAYS NICE.

09:38.749 --> 09:41.151
FOR EDIE'S SISTER.

09:41.151 --> 09:42.653
GOOD IDEA.

09:55.225 --> 09:56.967
(door shuts)

10:06.076 --> 10:09.710
HERE'S THE THING--
MY DAUGHTER HAS CANCER.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.012
SHE'S SO NAUSEOUS,
SHE'S STOPPED EATING,

10:12.012 --> 10:15.015
AND I CAN'T JUST STAND BY
AND WATCH HER WASTE AWAY.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.687
SO I ASKED AROUND,

10:16.687 --> 10:20.390
AND PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO GET ME WHAT I NEED.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.052
YOU FOLLOW MY DRIFT?

10:22.052 --> 10:24.054
UM... YEAH.

10:24.054 --> 10:26.226
YOU--YOU WANT ME
TO SCORE YOU SOME WEED.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.659
THE BEST STUFF YOU CAN GET.
 (unzips purse)

10:28.659 --> 10:30.630
NOTHING'S TOO GOOD
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

10:44.014 --> 10:46.216
DARLING?
 WHAT IS IT?

10:46.216 --> 10:48.949
WELL,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.182
I-I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE CONVENT.

10:52.182 --> 10:55.926
IT SEEMS DANIELLE
TOOK A LITTLE SPILL.

10:55.926 --> 10:58.128
YOU'RE 8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT!

10:58.128 --> 11:00.991
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME
WERE YOU DOING ROLLER-BLADING?

11:00.991 --> 11:03.694
I'M BORED.
ALL I DO IS LAY AROUND.

11:03.694 --> 11:06.196
IN YOUR CONDITION,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

11:06.196 --> 11:09.299
AND WHERE ON EARTH
DID YOU GET SKATES IN A CONVENT?

11:09.299 --> 11:11.842
I BORROWED THEM FROM ONE
OF THE EATING DISORDER GIRLS.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.844
THEY HAVE ALL
THE GOOD EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.045
Danielle,

11:15.045 --> 11:17.207
WHAT IF YOUR RECKLESS BEHAVIOR
HAD HURT THE BABY?

11:17.207 --> 11:19.950
THEY'RE GOING TO EXAMINE ME.
I'M SURE THE BABY'S FINE.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.952
YES, AND IT IS GOING
TO STAY THAT WAY

11:21.952 --> 11:23.954
BECAUSE I HAVE INSTRUCTED
SISTER THERESA

11:23.954 --> 11:25.956
TO KEEP YOU SEQUESTERED
IN YOUR ROOM

11:25.956 --> 11:28.719
UNTIL THE BABY IS BORN.
 What am I supposed to do
for fun?

11:28.719 --> 11:31.461
YOU WON'T EVEN GET ME
A DVD PLAYER.

11:31.461 --> 11:34.464
WELL, I WAS HOPING THAT YOU
COULD USE THESE LAST FEW WEEKS

11:34.464 --> 11:36.126
FOR REFLECTION
AND PERSONAL GROWTH.

11:36.126 --> 11:37.898
(scoffs) I HATE YOU.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.802
CLEARLY,
IT WOULD BE TIME WELL SPENT.

11:48.338 --> 11:49.840
HOW WAS THE LASAGNA?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.842
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK IT YOURSELF?

11:51.842 --> 11:53.343
HONEY.
 SORRY.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.345
AT LEAST EAT A LITTLE.

11:55.345 --> 11:57.487
WE NEED YOU IN FIGHTING FORM
FOR CHARADES TONIGHT.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.990
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

11:59.990 --> 12:03.223
YOU HAVE TO! YOU ARE
THE CHARADES ASSASSIN.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.725
THEY STILL TALK ABOUT
THE NIGHT THAT YOU GUESSED

12:05.725 --> 12:08.228
"THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY"
IN 15 SECONDS.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.399
12.

12:09.399 --> 12:11.401
AND THAT'S MY POINT.
I'M UNDEFEATED.

12:11.401 --> 12:13.403
WHY SPOIL MY WINNING STREAK

12:13.403 --> 12:15.836
BY PLAYING
WHEN I'M NOT UP TO IT?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.737
HONEY, PEOPLE...
KNOW THAT YOU'RE SICK.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.740
THEY DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE AT YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.912
(doorbell rings)

12:21.912 --> 12:25.245
TOM, HAIR LOSS
AND CONSTANT NAUSEA--

12:25.245 --> 12:26.746
THOSE ARE INCONVENIENCES.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.378
LOSING AT CHARADES
TO SUSAN MEYER--

12:28.378 --> 12:30.951
THAT IS JUST
FLAT-OUT INTOLERABLE.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.824
(knock on door)

12:33.824 --> 12:35.325
HEY, ANDREW.
 HEY.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.828
WHAT'S UP?
 HEY, MR. SCAVO, UM,

12:37.828 --> 12:40.831
A PACKAGE FOR LYNETTE'S MOM
GOT DELIVERED TO OUR HOUSE

12:40.831 --> 12:43.393
BY MISTAKE, SO...
 OH! I'M COMING.
I'VE GOT IT, TOM.

12:43.393 --> 12:48.168
IT'S A PATTERN. I'M...
KNITTING LYNETTE AN AFGHAN.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.173
(siren wailing in distance)

13:00.780 --> 13:02.412
(coughs)

13:08.418 --> 13:11.421
(telephone rings)

13:13.894 --> 13:16.566
(ring)

13:29.910 --> 13:33.283
A FRIEND OF MINE
RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE.

13:33.283 --> 13:35.285
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I EXPECTED.

13:35.285 --> 13:38.548
(car alarm wailing in distance)

13:38.548 --> 13:41.251
MUST BE ONE HECK OF A DOCTOR,
THOUGH, HUH?

13:41.251 --> 13:44.824
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST COME HERE
TO BUY CLEAN URINE.

13:47.998 --> 13:49.129
SHOO!

13:49.129 --> 13:51.962
THOSE ARE ONLY
FOR GROWN-UPS.
 WHY?

13:51.962 --> 13:54.464
BECAUSE THAT HAVE
SPECIAL MEDICINE IN THEM.

13:54.464 --> 13:57.107
LIKE THE GROWN-UP ICED TEA
YOU ALWAYS DRINK?

13:57.107 --> 13:59.109
SIMILAR. HOW ABOUT
SOME ICE CREAM INSTEAD?

13:59.109 --> 14:02.242
AND YOU CAN WATCH TV
TILL YOUR EYES FALL OUT.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.413
YEAH!
 AWESOME.

14:03.413 --> 14:05.015
YOUSTAY.

14:05.015 --> 14:08.048
GRANDMA NEEDS A FAVOR,

14:08.048 --> 14:11.851
AND YOU'VE GOT
JUST THE FACE FOR IT.

14:14.024 --> 14:17.487
WOW, SWEETIE.
THOSE REALLY LOOK DELICIOUS,

14:17.487 --> 14:20.330
BUT I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
EATING RIGHT NOW.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.032
JUST ONE, MOM?

14:22.032 --> 14:24.164
I MADE THEM SPECIAL...

14:24.164 --> 14:26.196
JUST FOR YOU.

14:36.346 --> 14:40.010
MMM.
THIS REALLY IS DELICIOUS.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
NOW IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,

14:53.593 --> 14:56.096
YOU CAN REACH ME
ON MY CELL PHONE.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.598
OR THEY CAN JUST
WALK ACROSS THE STREET.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.631
HAVE FUN, GIRLS.
DON'T DO ANYTHING I WOULD DO.
 (chuckles)

15:03.403 --> 15:06.206
ADAM SEEMS
REALLY LAID-BACK.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.079
(door opens and shuts)
 YEAH, HE'S PRETTY COOL.

15:09.079 --> 15:13.113
OF COURSE, EVERYONE SEEMS COOL
COMPARED TO ROBO-MOM.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
(chuckles)
HEY, YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.687
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU
ASKED HER ABOUT YOUR REAL DAD?

15:17.687 --> 15:20.190
SHE FREAKED OUT,
JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.953
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

15:22.953 --> 15:26.096
WELL...

15:26.096 --> 15:28.498
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO FIND THINGS OUT.

15:28.498 --> 15:30.500
DOES YOUR MOM KEEP
ANY OLD PAPERS?

15:30.500 --> 15:33.103
YOU KNOW,
LETTERS, DIARIES?

15:33.103 --> 15:35.105
NOT THAT SHE SHOWS ME.

15:35.105 --> 15:37.407
THERE'S STUFF
IN THE STORAGE ROOM UPSTAIRS,

15:37.407 --> 15:40.270
BUT IT'S LOCKED,
SO FORGET ABOUT IT.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.115
WHAT KIND OF LOCK IS IT?

15:48.979 --> 15:52.122
OH, COME ON IN.
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE SUSAN.

15:52.122 --> 15:54.024
SHE'S NOT HERE?

15:54.024 --> 15:56.226
NO, AND SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER CELL PHONE.
 WHERE IS SHE?

15:56.226 --> 15:58.688
WELL, SHE HAD AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THIS NEW OBSTETRICIAN

15:58.688 --> 16:01.461
OVER ON RIVER STREET,
BUT SHE SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.463
WHY WOULD SHE SEE A DOCTOR
OVER THERE?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
THAT'S
A TERRIBLE NEIGHBORHOOD.
 IT IS?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.966
YES. DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.469
THAT'S WHERE THEY MURDERED
THOSE TWO PROSTITUTES LAST YEAR.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.401
WE SHOULD HELP MIKE
WITH THE FOOD.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.473
KNOCK, KNOCK.
 (singsong voice) WE'RE HERE.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.704
OH, GOOD!

16:14.704 --> 16:17.077
KATHERINE, I WAS HOPING
WE'D GET A CHANCE TO CHAT.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.450
(lowers voice)
OPEN THIS NOW.

16:20.450 --> 16:23.613
UGH. SUSAN'S PARTIES ARE
ALWAYS SUCH A SNOOZEFEST.

16:23.613 --> 16:26.116
THE ONLY THING
PEOPLE WILL BE MIMING IS

16:26.116 --> 16:28.358
"GET ME THE HELL
OUT OF HERE."

16:28.358 --> 16:31.091
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE OVERDRESSED
FOR CHARADES?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.093
OH, I THOUGHT
THAT I'D LOOK NICE,

16:33.093 --> 16:35.095
JUST IN CASE
WE DECIDED TO...

16:35.095 --> 16:39.499
OH, I DON'T KNOW--
ANNOUNCE OUR ENGAGEMENT?

16:39.499 --> 16:42.732
(chuckles) WE'RE NOT
ANNOUNCING ANYTHING.

16:44.274 --> 16:46.276
IT'S SUSAN AND MIKE'S PARTY.

16:46.276 --> 16:48.708
I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE IT
ALL ABOUT US.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.210
YOU'RE RIGHT, DARLING.

16:50.210 --> 16:54.444
I MAY DROP A FEW HINTS,
THOUGH.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.446
EDIE, LET ME BE CLEAR
ON THIS.

16:56.446 --> 16:59.349
YOU ARE NOT TO TELL ANYONE
ABOUT OUR ENGAGEMENT, GOT IT?

16:59.349 --> 17:03.022
FINE. I WON'T SAY A WORD.

17:04.794 --> 17:07.297
(door opens)

17:18.108 --> 17:19.608
OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

17:19.608 --> 17:21.611
YOU KNOW EDWARD FERBER?
STATE SENATOR?

17:21.611 --> 17:23.772
YES.

17:23.772 --> 17:27.446
HIS WIFE JUST GOT
PICKED UP FOR SHOPLIFTING.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.179
WHY IS THAT FANTASTIC?

17:29.179 --> 17:30.480
HE WAS MAKING NOISES

17:30.480 --> 17:32.482
ABOUT GOING AGAINST ME
FOR GOVERNOR.

17:32.482 --> 17:34.484
I GUESS
THE LIGHT-FINGERED MRS. FERBER

17:34.484 --> 17:36.486
JUST PUT AN END TO THAT.

17:36.486 --> 17:38.488
WHY? IT'S NOT LIKE
 HESHOPLIFTED.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.490
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S A SCANDAL.

17:40.490 --> 17:43.493
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO
TO POLL NUMBERS.
 (gasps) OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:43.493 --> 17:46.496
I WAS READING ABOUT THAT IN
"POLITICS IS BORING" MAGAZINE.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.498
I'M JUST GLAD
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

17:48.498 --> 17:52.542
ABOUT YOU PULLING CRAP
LIKE THAT.
 YEAH, YOU'RE LUCKY.

17:54.504 --> 17:56.206
SO WHERE'S LYNETTE?

17:56.206 --> 17:58.178
SHE'S USUALLY
YOUR CHARADES M.V.P.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.180
AH, SHE WASN'T FEELING
SO WELL,

18:00.180 --> 18:02.682
BUT, UH, YOU ARE STILL
GOING DOWN, MISTER.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.684
IT'S JUST A GAME, TOM--

18:04.684 --> 18:06.686
A GAME YOU WISH
YOU NEVER PLAYED.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.087
SO MUCH WORK...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.088
AHEM.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.590
OH, HI, GABY.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.763
KATHERINE AND I WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT THE OLD DAYS.

18:13.763 --> 18:16.266
SO WHEN YOU WERE LIVING
WITH YOUR AUNT,

18:16.266 --> 18:19.169
WAS DYLAN'S FATHER WITH YOU?
 NO, JUST ME AND DYLAN.

18:19.169 --> 18:22.872
WERE YOU WIDOWED
OR DIVORCED?

18:22.872 --> 18:27.177
ACTUALLY, I PREFER NOT
TO DISCUSS MY FIRST MARRIAGE...

18:27.177 --> 18:28.578
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

18:28.578 --> 18:32.542
OH. WELL, WE CERTAINLY
DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.545
LET ME JUST
TIDGE THAT UP FOR YOU.

18:35.545 --> 18:37.717
HELLO, ALL.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.721
AH, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
SOME WINE?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.595
OH, NO.

18:45.595 --> 18:49.799
OH, MY CONTACT SLIPPED.

18:49.799 --> 18:52.232
EDIE,
IS THAT AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

18:52.232 --> 18:57.367
OH! UH, SHOOT.
PRETEND YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.270
I PROMISED MY FIANCé
THAT I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD

19:00.270 --> 19:01.911
UNTIL
THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

19:03.313 --> 19:06.776
EXCUSE ME.

19:06.776 --> 19:09.319
GABY! SORRY I'M LATE.

19:09.319 --> 19:11.481
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!
YOU MADE IT.

19:11.481 --> 19:14.754
THAT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DRESS.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.228
YOU... COME WITH ME.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.192
SHE'S GOT A RING!
 WHAT?

19:22.192 --> 19:25.235
EDIE--SHE'S WEARING
A BIG, HONKIN' ENGAGEMENT RING

19:25.235 --> 19:28.398
THE SIZE OF A PEACH PIT.
 HEY, I DIDN'T GET HER
A RING!

19:28.398 --> 19:30.640
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED?
 WELL, SEE, HERE'S THE THING--

19:30.640 --> 19:33.503
OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!
 LET ME EXPLAIN!

19:33.503 --> 19:35.675
NO, NO, NO. I AM DONE
WITH YOUR EXPLANATIONS,

19:35.675 --> 19:38.648
AND I AM DONE WITH "JUST
GIVE ME TWO MORE WEEKS, BABY."

19:38.648 --> 19:41.651
WHATEVER GAMES YOU'RE PLAYING,
I'M SICK OF IT. WE'RE THROUGH.

19:41.651 --> 19:43.653
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
GO AND LIVE

19:43.653 --> 19:46.356
HAPPILY EVER AFTER
WITH VICTOR, HUH?

19:46.356 --> 19:48.418
(scoffs) YOU THINK VICTOR'S
MY ONLY OPTION?

19:48.418 --> 19:50.420
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
CARLOS.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.563
I CAN HAVE ANY GUY I WANT,
BECAUSETHIS...

19:53.563 --> 19:55.365
WAITS FOR NO MAN.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.875
YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF
AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

20:05.875 --> 20:09.379
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS, CARLOS.
HOW LONG WAS I SUPPOSED TO WAIT?

20:09.379 --> 20:11.441
YOU AGREED
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.

20:11.441 --> 20:15.315
AH, BUT I DIDN'T AGREE
NOT TOWEARANYTHING.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.318
DON'T WORRY.
IT WASN'T EXPENSIVE.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.950
YOU CAN PAY ME BACK LATER.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.692
COUNT ON IT.

20:22.692 --> 20:26.526
AND THE WHOLE TIME, I JUST KEPT
THINKING, THIS IS BREE'S DOCTOR.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.258
BREERECOMMENDED HIM.

20:28.258 --> 20:30.260
HE MUST BE THE BEST.

20:30.260 --> 20:33.263
SO I DIDN'T WORRY WHEN IT WAS
BETWEEN A NEEDLE EXCHANGE

20:33.263 --> 20:35.765
AND THE AREA'S ONLY
TRANSVESTITE BOOKSTORE.

20:35.765 --> 20:38.968
AND I IGNORED THAT MY SHOES
STUCK TO THE FLOOR

20:38.968 --> 20:40.970
AND THERE WAS
A CIGARETTE MACHINE

20:40.970 --> 20:42.472
IN THE WAITING ROOM,

20:42.472 --> 20:47.246
BUT WHEN I SAW THE ANT TRAPS
ON HIS SPECULUM TRAY,

20:47.246 --> 20:50.280
I THOUGHT THAT YOU AND I
SHOULD HAVE A TALK.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.452
OH, SUSAN, I AM SO SORRY,
AND, OF COURSE,

20:52.452 --> 20:55.955
I WILL PAY FOR THE SLASHED TIRE
AND THE STOLEN CELL PHONE.
 THAT IS NOT THE POINT!

20:55.955 --> 20:57.957
WHY WOULD YOU SEND ME
TO SOMEBODY

20:57.957 --> 21:00.360
WHO IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT YOUR DOCTOR?

21:01.461 --> 21:02.962
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.394
WHY NOT?

21:04.394 --> 21:06.466
UH... IT'S PRIVATE.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.468
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS PRIVATE?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.470
THE PARTS OF ME
THAT I'M PRETTY SURE

21:10.470 --> 21:13.803
HE SNAPPED
WITH HIS CAMERA PHONE.

21:13.803 --> 21:17.507
I HAVE A PARTY TO THROW.
I WILL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.

21:19.008 --> 21:20.750
OH! (gasps)

21:22.752 --> 21:25.785
(lowered voice) LOOK, AL,
SHE IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.388
I NEED HER TAKEN CARE OF.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.990
FINE.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.992
(beep)
 (Edie) I PROMISED MY FIANCé

21:32.992 --> 21:36.396
THAT I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD
UNTIL THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

21:36.396 --> 21:40.600
ADAM, I FEEL THE TAG
OF MY DRESS STICKING OUT,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.772
AND I CAN'T REACH IT.
DO YOU MIND?

21:42.772 --> 21:44.934
OH, SURE.

21:44.934 --> 21:46.536
THERE YOU GO.

21:46.536 --> 21:50.039
OOH! I THINK I GOT A CHILL.
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)

21:50.039 --> 21:53.843
NOW LET ME SEE
IF I CAN GIVEYOUONE.
 OH, YEAH, IT WORKED.

21:58.948 --> 22:00.950
(lowered voice) WE HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE AN HOUR,

22:00.950 --> 22:03.953
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
HUMILIATING ME?
 ARE WE REALLY HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN?

22:03.953 --> 22:06.396
OH, I GUESS YOU LEARNED
NOTHING FROM CHICAGO.

22:06.396 --> 22:08.398
FOR GOD SAKE,
I WAS NOT FLIRTING.

22:08.398 --> 22:10.430
SHE ASKED ME
TO FIX HER DRESS.
 YEAH. I SAW YOUR FACE.

22:10.430 --> 22:13.603
I COULD TELL WHAT A CHORE
IT WAS FOR YOU.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:13.603 --> 22:17.507
I THINK I'M A LITTLE BEHIND YOU
IN THE ALCOHOL DEPARTMENT.

22:17.507 --> 22:19.509
LET ME GO CATCH UP.

22:19.509 --> 22:21.911
(men speaking indistinctly,
laughing)

22:21.911 --> 22:23.413
I'M SORRY.

22:23.413 --> 22:25.344
I, UH, DIDN'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP,

22:25.344 --> 22:28.347
BUT YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
TAKE THIS OUT ON ADAM.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.480
GABRIELLE HAS A LITTLE BIT
OF A REPUTATION,

22:30.480 --> 22:32.482
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

22:32.482 --> 22:35.385
NO, I DON'T.

22:35.385 --> 22:38.388
BUT I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO.

22:38.388 --> 22:40.460
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.963
UM, OKAY.
I WILL BE TEAM CAPTAIN ONE.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.965
WHO WANTS TO BE
CAPTAIN NUMBER TWO?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.398
I'LL DO IT.
 GREAT.

22:48.398 --> 22:50.039
(Susan)
OKAY, YOU PICK FIRST.

22:50.039 --> 22:51.841
OH, OKAY.

22:51.841 --> 22:53.873
I WILL PICK ADAM.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.075
AH.

22:56.075 --> 22:59.048
I PICK LYNETTE.
WHERE'S LYNETTE?

22:59.048 --> 23:01.050
UH, SHE REALLY WANTED
TO BE HERE.

23:01.050 --> 23:03.553
SHE'S JUST FEELING
TOO SICK TO PARTY.

23:03.553 --> 23:07.517
(laughing)

23:07.517 --> 23:09.158
THAT'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

23:09.158 --> 23:13.993
ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S GENIUS.
HE'S A SPONGE, BUT HE TALKS!

23:13.993 --> 23:16.926
(Lynette continues laughing)

23:16.926 --> 23:19.529
WELL, LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
IS FEELING A LITTLE BETTER.

23:19.529 --> 23:22.702
YEAH. I GUESS
THAT ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICINE

23:22.702 --> 23:24.434
FINALLY KICKED IN.

23:24.434 --> 23:27.977
THAT MUST BE IT.

23:27.977 --> 23:30.179
(laughs)
 (Parker laughs)

23:30.179 --> 23:33.583
ORSON.
 CARLOS.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.114
UM...
HUSBAND IN THE ROOM?

23:35.114 --> 23:37.687
HONEY, I LOVE YOU,
BUT I WANNA WIN.

23:37.687 --> 23:39.989
(laughs)

23:39.989 --> 23:41.491
YOU SHOULD PICK EDIE.

23:41.491 --> 23:42.622
WHY?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.954
THE WOMAN JUST TRIED
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

23:44.954 --> 23:47.527
DON'T MAKE HER LAST PICK.
SHE'S STILL FRAGILE.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.459
GOOD POINT. MIKE!

23:49.459 --> 23:50.960
YES! LET'S GET STARTED.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.863
NO, NO! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
GABY, YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

23:53.863 --> 23:56.506
OKAY, FIRST, I HAVE TO GO OVER
ALL THE SIGNALS.

23:56.506 --> 23:58.468
(groans)
 OKAY, SO, UM,

23:58.468 --> 24:00.540
THIS IS "MOVIE," UM, "TV"...

24:02.211 --> 24:04.043
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO DO THIS?

24:04.043 --> 24:06.976
WHEN YOU LIVE WITH A MOTHER WHO
CONSTANTLY LOCKS HERSELF OUT,

24:06.976 --> 24:08.478
YOU DEVELOP CERTAIN SKILLS.

24:13.022 --> 24:16.556
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THIS IS
A SIGN WE SHOULD STOP.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.857
(door creaks)

24:17.857 --> 24:20.530
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT SIGNS?

24:22.932 --> 24:26.696
"A WHOLE CONCEPT,"
"PERSON," UM, LET'S SEE.

24:26.696 --> 24:31.470
"SHAKESPEARE," "BOOK," AND THEN
IF YOU DO THE SIGNAL FOR "BOOK"

24:31.470 --> 24:33.242
AND YOU TOUCH YOUR HEART,
THEN THAT'S "POEM."

24:33.242 --> 24:37.647
OKAY, WHEN HAS ANYONE EVER
USED A POEM AS A CLUE?
 YEAH, COME ON. LET'S PLAY.

24:37.647 --> 24:38.648
LET'S PLAY!

24:38.648 --> 24:39.749
(cheering)

24:39.749 --> 24:42.211
YEAH! LET'S PLAY!

24:42.211 --> 24:46.255
HEY, HONEY! YOU MADE IT.
 HA! DIBS ON LYNETTE!
SHE'S ON MY TEAM!

24:46.255 --> 24:49.659
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
SHE'S LIKE THE CHARADES NINJA.

24:49.659 --> 24:52.662
THAT'S ME! THE NINJA!
WHAA-YA! WHAA!

24:52.662 --> 24:54.624
AHH! (laughs)

24:54.624 --> 24:56.526
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO...
(laughs)

24:56.526 --> 25:00.570
OKAY. (babbles) OKAY!
I'M READY.

25:00.570 --> 25:02.602
(gasps)

25:09.508 --> 25:11.581
OKAY, GO.
 (all) SHOE.

25:11.581 --> 25:12.511
SOCK.
 WORKING OUT.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.684
(Bree) BLACK.
 (Victor) SOLE.

25:14.684 --> 25:16.245
(Bree) ITCH. ITCH.
SCRATCH.
 OH. AAH.

25:16.245 --> 25:18.047
A BLISTER.
 HA!

25:18.047 --> 25:20.519
SOUNDS LIKE "BLISTER."
SISTER.
 (Victor) KISSED HER.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.093
"TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA"!
 (cheering)

25:24.093 --> 25:27.927
OKAY, 22 SECONDS.
LYNETTE, YOU'RE UP.
 (Tom) COME ON, BABE.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.529
WE'RE 40 SECONDS DOWN. WE NEED
YOU TO MAKE THAT TIME UP.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.604
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?
 RIGHT ON.

25:34.604 --> 25:36.566
(Susan) ALL RIGHT. WHOO!
 (clapping)

25:36.566 --> 25:40.539
READY? GET SET... GO.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.812
OKAY.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.276
(scoffs)

25:47.276 --> 25:49.619
(whimpers)

25:49.619 --> 25:51.050
HONEY, CLOCK'S TICKING.

25:51.050 --> 25:55.785
I KNOW. JUST,
THIS IS A REALLY HARD ONE.

25:55.785 --> 25:58.688
OKAY, COME ON, COME ON.
WHAT IS--WHAT IS IT?

25:58.688 --> 26:00.790
IS IT A BOOK? IS IT A MOVIE?
 MOVIE. IT'S A WESTERN.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.833
NO TALKING.
 SORRY.

26:03.833 --> 26:05.935
HONEY,
START WITH THE FIRST WORD.

26:05.935 --> 26:07.997
HOW MANY SYLLABLES?

26:07.997 --> 26:10.199
(muttering)

26:12.672 --> 26:13.973
UGH.
 ONE WORD.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.946
SWEETIE, ACT IT OUT.
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.682
OKAY, OKAY.
WHOLE IDEA.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.013
ME.
 EDIE.

26:24.013 --> 26:26.115
WOMAN. BLONDE. BLEACH!

26:26.115 --> 26:29.588
(grunts) OH! (gasps)

26:30.990 --> 26:34.764
AAH! (imitates choking)

26:34.764 --> 26:37.096
AAH! (grunts)

26:39.869 --> 26:41.330
"HANG 'EM HIGH"?

26:41.330 --> 26:43.172
YES! YES!

26:43.172 --> 26:45.975
(Lynette laughing) YES!

26:45.975 --> 26:50.009
OKAY. WELL, I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR A BREAK.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.111
GOOD IDEA.
 YEAH.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.283
(laughs)
 YOU FEELING OKAY?

26:54.283 --> 26:56.285
'CAUSE YOU'RE... ACTING
KINDA SPACEY.

26:56.285 --> 26:58.047
YEAH, NO, I'M GOOD.

26:58.047 --> 27:01.721
HEY, DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
ANY GRAPES OR LOBSTER?

27:01.721 --> 27:04.754
WHY--WHY DON'T I GO GET YOU
SOME COFFEE, HON?

27:04.754 --> 27:07.126
UH, UM, ORSON?
 HMM?

27:07.126 --> 27:10.299
HEY, UM, THERE'S A PHONE CALL
FOR YOU AT THE HOUSE.

27:10.299 --> 27:12.762
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE IT.

27:12.762 --> 27:15.264
UH, THANKS. YEAH.

27:23.112 --> 27:24.643
HI.
 HELLO.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.146
HELLO.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.317
OH, TOM.

27:28.317 --> 27:29.919
STELLA, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:29.919 --> 27:34.383
UH... I MADE SOME BROWNIES
EARLIER,

27:34.383 --> 27:38.657
AND I JUST... NOTICED
THEY WERE MISSING.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.931
UH... LYNETTE DIDN'T
BRING THEM HERE, DID SHE?

27:41.931 --> 27:44.663
WHY? IS THAT A PROBLEM?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.665
IT'S LIKE CHOCOLATE LOVE.
 OH!

27:46.665 --> 27:49.668
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.171
SORRY, UH, DON'T EAT THOSE.
DON'T EAT THOSE. SORRY.

27:52.171 --> 27:55.674
UH, NO! OOH. BAD BATCH.
 BAD.BAD, BAD, BAD.

27:55.674 --> 28:00.750
WHOA. (chuckles) SORRY.
FULL OF TRANS FATS.

28:00.750 --> 28:01.851
OH!
 OH!

28:01.851 --> 28:05.855
OH! TOM, WATCH IT!
 I AM SORRY.

28:05.855 --> 28:07.857
OH, HERE. OH.
LET ME GET THAT.

28:07.857 --> 28:10.219
THANK YOU.
 OH, GOD. OKAY.

28:10.219 --> 28:11.721
IT'S A LITTLE COLD.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.222
SORRY.
 IT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.224
WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH
TO ASK YOU

28:15.224 --> 28:17.767
TO KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF MY HUSBAND?

28:17.767 --> 28:19.368
WHAT?
I SPILLED MY DRINK ON HIM.

28:19.368 --> 28:22.802
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR IT BY BREAST-FEEDING HIM?

28:22.802 --> 28:23.833
UH, KATHERINE?

28:23.833 --> 28:25.835
LOOK, LADY,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

28:25.835 --> 28:27.737
YOU'RE GETTING A REPUTATION
AROUND HERE

28:27.737 --> 28:29.739
FOR HAVING A STICK
UP YOUR ASS.

28:29.739 --> 28:33.712
BETTER THAT REPUTATION THAN
THE ONE YOU'RE TOTING AROUND.
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.845
OKAY, BACK TO CHARADES.
 NEVER MIND. FORGET IT.

28:35.845 --> 28:38.848
OH, NO, NO. TELL ME.
WHAT'S MY "REPUTATION"?

28:38.848 --> 28:40.850
AM I SMUG
AND HOLIER-THAN-THOU?

28:40.850 --> 28:43.793
OH, NO, WAIT.
THAT'S YOU.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.855
LET ME BE SPECIFIC.

28:45.855 --> 28:48.898
BY "REPUTATION," I MEAN
THAT YOU ARE THE KIND OF WOMAN

28:48.898 --> 28:50.930
THAT TREATS A MAN
LIKE A PLAYTHING,

28:50.930 --> 28:54.133
WHETHER IT'S MY HUSBAND OR LET'S
SAY... YOUR TEENAGE GARDENER?

29:01.210 --> 29:04.373
BREE SAW YOU SLAP
YOUR DAUGHTER.

29:04.373 --> 29:06.776
EXCUSE ME?

29:06.776 --> 29:08.347
(whispers) GABY!

29:08.347 --> 29:11.350
YEAH, SHE ASKED ABOUT HER FATHER
AND THEN YOU SMACKED HER.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.822
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

29:12.822 --> 29:16.986
THIS IS THE LAST THING
THAT I WILL EVER SAY TO YOU.

29:18.227 --> 29:20.229
YES, I LOST MY TEMPER
WITH DYLAN,

29:20.229 --> 29:22.231
BUT HER FATHER
IS A HORRIBLE MAN.

29:22.231 --> 29:24.233
I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE
THE WORST THING

29:24.233 --> 29:26.936
THAT A FATHER CAN DO
TO HIS DAUGHTER.

29:26.936 --> 29:29.899
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO TELL DYLAN ABOUT THAT, HMM?

29:31.170 --> 29:35.905
I HOPE THAT SATISFIES
EVERYONE'S CURIOSITY.

29:37.546 --> 29:39.048
(sets glass down)

29:42.912 --> 29:45.985
OH, MY GOD.

29:45.985 --> 29:49.819
"HANG 'EM HIGH"
HAS THREE SYLLABLES.

29:58.928 --> 30:02.571
I GUESS YOU... SAW
WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE.

30:02.571 --> 30:04.273
YEP.

30:04.273 --> 30:07.937
LOOK,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

30:07.937 --> 30:09.909
AND--AND IT DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.911
HOW MANY PEOPLE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

30:11.911 --> 30:15.885
NOW OR BEFORE TONIGHT?

30:15.885 --> 30:17.346
(chuckles nervously)

30:17.346 --> 30:18.417
HOW MANY?

30:18.417 --> 30:20.890
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
 I'M NOT UPSET.

30:20.890 --> 30:24.823
I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK OUT
HOW TO SPIN THIS.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.326
CLEARLY,
THE BOY WAS UNDERAGE.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.828
DO YOU THINK
MONEY WOULD SHUT HIM UP?

30:29.828 --> 30:33.232
VICTOR, REALLY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

30:33.232 --> 30:37.166
HMM. THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT ME.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.475
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER THIS.

30:46.475 --> 30:49.348
THIS IS BODSWORTH.
YOU TOOK HIM EVERYWHERE.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.420
NO, I THINK I'D REMEMBER
A BEAR THAT UGLY.

30:51.420 --> 30:52.922
WELL, CLEARLY, IT'S YOURS.

30:52.922 --> 30:55.524
YOUR MOM KEPT IT
ALL THESE YEARS,

30:55.524 --> 30:57.526
AND HE'S HERE
IN YOUR OLD ROOM.

30:57.526 --> 31:00.930
WAIT. THIS WAS MY OLD ROOM?
MY MOM TOLD ME

31:00.930 --> 31:03.162
I'M IN MY OLD ROOM
DOWN THE HALL.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.365
NO, THIS WAS YOUR ROOM.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:06.365 --> 31:09.939
EVENING, GIRLS.

31:09.939 --> 31:13.442
HEY. HOW WAS THE PARTY?

31:13.442 --> 31:14.944
IT WAS LOVELY.

31:14.944 --> 31:18.177
I THINK YOUR MOTHER WOULD
LIKE YOU HOME TO HELP CLEAN UP.

31:30.059 --> 31:32.121
I'M SORRY, MOM.

31:32.121 --> 31:35.194
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

31:39.929 --> 31:43.973
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
SEEING THAT GIRL ANYMORE.

31:56.015 --> 31:58.017
ORSON, HONEY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

31:58.017 --> 32:01.090
WE GOT A CALL
FROM DANIELLE'S DOCTOR.

32:01.090 --> 32:04.153
APPARENTLY, HER FALL CAUSED
A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION,

32:04.153 --> 32:07.056
WHERE THE PLACENTA
SEPARATES FROM THE UTERUS.
 OH, MY GOD.

32:07.056 --> 32:10.059
NOW THEY SAID NOT TO PANIC.
THERE ARE DEGREES OF THIS.

32:10.059 --> 32:12.962
THEY'RE DOING A SONOGRAM,
THEN THEY'RE GONNA CALL US.

32:12.962 --> 32:15.934
I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
I HAVE TO BE WITH HER.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.007
OKAY. I'LL GET YOUR PURSE.
HMM?

32:21.040 --> 32:24.313
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
YOU CAN'T LEAVE YET.

32:24.313 --> 32:26.315
SOMETHING'S COME UP.
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

32:26.315 --> 32:28.017
NO, WE'LL TALK NOW.

32:28.017 --> 32:31.020
YOU STILL OWE ME AN EXPLANATION
FOR THAT SCUZZY GYNO

32:31.020 --> 32:34.023
YOU SENT ME TO.
 I SAID I WAS SORRY.
FOR GOD SAKES, SUSAN,

32:34.023 --> 32:36.025
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

32:37.626 --> 32:41.030
OH, I KNOW THIS NIGHT
HAS BEEN A COMPLETE DISASTER,

32:41.030 --> 32:44.663
BUT ALL IN ALL, IT'S STILL
YOUR BEST PARTY EVER.

32:59.008 --> 33:01.450
(moaning)

33:01.450 --> 33:03.052
I'M CONFUSED.

33:03.052 --> 33:05.254
OW! NOW I'M CONFUSED,
AND MY HEAD HURTS.

33:05.254 --> 33:09.018
THAT'S FOR LETTING EDIE
THINK YOU'RE ENGAGED.
 AND THE KISS?

33:09.018 --> 33:12.721
WHEN YOU SAW ME FLIRTING,
YOU SMASHED A GLASS.

33:12.721 --> 33:15.224
WHEN VICTOR HEARD
I HAD AN AFFAIR,

33:15.224 --> 33:17.496
HE STARTED CRUNCHING
POLL NUMBERS.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.201
I NEED A MAN
WHO CARES ENOUGH TO EXPLODE

33:22.201 --> 33:25.334
WHEN HE THINKS
HE'S GONNA LOSE ME.

33:25.334 --> 33:29.638
I DON'T JUST LOVE YOU.
ILOVETHEWAYYOU LOVE ME.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.011
SO WE'RE BACK ON?

33:33.011 --> 33:35.244
SEE YOU THURSDAY.

33:52.161 --> 33:54.303
AL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME?

33:54.303 --> 33:57.106
I think I found a way
to make this happen,

33:57.106 --> 34:00.339
but it might take a week or two
to line everything up.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.570
FANTASTIC.

34:01.570 --> 34:05.414
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN IT'S DONE.
SHIRLEY?

34:07.176 --> 34:09.717
CAN YOU MAKE SOME COPIES
OF THE BRITT FILE?

34:15.083 --> 34:16.554
(chuckles)

34:18.587 --> 34:19.828
AHH.

34:19.828 --> 34:21.590
SEEN GABY?

34:21.590 --> 34:24.193
UH, YEAH,
IN THE BATHROOM UPSTAIRS.

34:24.193 --> 34:26.235
TELL ME SOMETHING.

34:26.235 --> 34:29.737
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
THAT KID WHO YOU WERE PAYING

34:29.737 --> 34:32.571
TO MOW YOUR LAWN
WAS DOING YOUR WIFE,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.672
HOW DID YOU NOT KILL HIM?

34:34.672 --> 34:38.447
WELL, I WANTED TO AT FIRST,
BUT...

34:38.447 --> 34:41.810
HEY, WE'RE ALL HUMAN, RIGHT?
WE GOTTA FORGIVE AND FORGET.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.812
YOU'RE
A VERY UNDERSTANDING MAN.

34:43.812 --> 34:46.415
IF SHE PULLED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON ME,

34:46.415 --> 34:49.288
THAT GUY WOULDN'T BE AROUND
FOR LONG.

34:49.288 --> 34:53.161
YEAH, BUT NO WOMAN'S WORTH
GOING TO JAIL FOR, RIGHT?

34:53.161 --> 34:55.164
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,

34:55.164 --> 34:59.428
IT'S NOT THAT HARD
TO MAKE SOMEONE DISAPPEAR.
 (footsteps descend stairs)

35:02.371 --> 35:03.872
LET'S GO, HONEY.

35:03.872 --> 35:06.835
NIGHT, CARLOS.

35:14.283 --> 35:15.514
(door shuts)

35:25.354 --> 35:27.626
DARLING,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:27.626 --> 35:30.459
I HAVE TO BRING
THIS DVD PLAYER TO DANIELLE.

35:30.459 --> 35:32.801
HONEY, WE REALLY HAVE TO GO.

35:32.801 --> 35:36.165
IT'LL JUST TAKE A FEW SECONDS.
THESE DAMN CORDS...

35:36.165 --> 35:39.568
SWEETHEART, IT'S A LONG DRIVE.
 IT'S THE ONLY THING
SHE ASKED FOR.

35:39.568 --> 35:42.871
(telephone rings)

35:42.871 --> 35:44.913
(ring)

35:44.913 --> 35:47.276
(beep)
 YES. HELLO?

35:47.276 --> 35:48.517
HELLO, DOCTOR.

35:49.748 --> 35:52.281
HOW IS SHE?

35:55.354 --> 35:56.585
THANK GOD.

35:56.585 --> 35:59.328
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

35:59.328 --> 36:00.829
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

36:00.829 --> 36:03.832
(crying)

36:14.343 --> 36:16.345
KIDS ARE ALL TUCKED IN.

36:16.345 --> 36:18.347
THEY'RE SLEEPING
LIKE ANGELS.

36:18.347 --> 36:21.280
GREAT. DID YOU PUT QUAALUDES
IN THEIR COCOA?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.782
COULD YOU CHECK ON 'EM FOR ME,
PLEASE?

36:26.184 --> 36:28.186
SO HOW WAS THE PARTY?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.658
YOU DRUGGED ME.

36:29.658 --> 36:31.860
OH. JUST A LITTLE.

36:31.860 --> 36:33.862
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

36:33.862 --> 36:36.365
I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T WANT ANY POT.

36:36.365 --> 36:39.368
BEFORE YOU SLAP ME AROUND,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

36:39.368 --> 36:41.230
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

36:41.230 --> 36:42.731
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

36:42.731 --> 36:46.535
AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
USING MY SON AS A DRUG MULE?

36:46.535 --> 36:48.537
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

36:48.537 --> 36:52.511
AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT?

36:52.511 --> 36:54.513
LET ME ASKYOUSOMETHING.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.316
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I WORE
TO THE JUNIOR PROM

36:57.316 --> 37:00.349
OR WHAT PART I HAD
IN THE PLAY THAT YEAR?

37:00.349 --> 37:02.821
WHO REMEMBERS THAT STUFF?

37:02.821 --> 37:06.355
PARENTS WHO WEREN'T STONED.

37:06.355 --> 37:08.797
MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
PASSED IN A BLUR

37:08.797 --> 37:11.660
BECAUSEYOUWERE
MEDICATING YOURSELF--

37:11.660 --> 37:14.663
POT WHEN YOU WERE SICK,
BOOZE WHEN YOU WEREN'T.

37:14.663 --> 37:16.665
I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

37:16.665 --> 37:19.538
I WON'T MISS A SECOND
OF MY KIDS' LIVES,

37:19.538 --> 37:21.540
NOT IF I CAN AVOID IT.

37:21.540 --> 37:25.314
WELL, I'D SAY I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M NOT.

37:26.945 --> 37:30.349
YOU'RE A MOM. YOU KNOW,

37:30.349 --> 37:32.951
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
WATCHING YOUR KIDS SUFFER,

37:32.951 --> 37:37.856
AND SEEING YOU...
ACT ALL GOOFY,

37:37.856 --> 37:40.859
WATCHING THAT CARTOON,
WELL...

37:42.361 --> 37:45.634
IT WAS PROBABLY
THE HIGH POINT OF MY TRIP.

37:45.634 --> 37:48.297
I GET IT.

37:50.739 --> 37:53.342
BUT IF YOU EVER PULL
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN...

37:53.342 --> 37:55.804
I WON'T.

37:55.804 --> 37:58.907
OKAY. WELL...

37:58.907 --> 38:00.979
I THINK I'LL TURN IN.

38:03.952 --> 38:05.314
YENTA.

38:05.314 --> 38:06.555
WHAT?

38:06.555 --> 38:10.389
JUNIOR YEAR, YOU WERE YENTA
IN "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF."

38:10.389 --> 38:13.422
YOU REMEMBERED.

38:13.422 --> 38:16.325
YEAH. THERE ARE
SOME PERFORMANCES SO BAD,

38:16.325 --> 38:18.327
EVEN ALCOHOL
CAN'T BLOCK THEM OUT.

38:30.379 --> 38:31.910
BREE?

38:33.642 --> 38:37.386
CAN WE CALL A TRUCE,
PLEASE?

38:40.449 --> 38:43.422
SO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT BLUFFING, UM,

38:43.422 --> 38:44.923
I BROUGHT CAKE.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.499
I AM SO SORRY THAT
I SNAPPED AT YOU TONIGHT.

38:50.499 --> 38:52.361
IT'S OKAY.

38:52.361 --> 38:56.435
I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.467
EVER SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN PREGNANT,

38:58.467 --> 39:01.039
THERE'S BEEN THIS WALL
BETWEEN US.

39:01.039 --> 39:04.743
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S CHANGED,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

39:04.743 --> 39:07.345
DID I DO SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

39:10.449 --> 39:11.950
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.883
I'VE JUST BEEN
GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS.

39:14.883 --> 39:18.927
LIKE WHAT? I MEAN,
COME ON. JUST TELL ME.

39:18.927 --> 39:20.859
WE SHARE EVERYTHING.

39:20.859 --> 39:24.533
OKAY. UM...

39:25.894 --> 39:28.637
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY THIS,
BUT...

39:31.039 --> 39:34.503
IT'S, UH, ABOUT THE BABY.

39:37.546 --> 39:39.748
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME COMPLICATIONS.

39:39.748 --> 39:42.150
OH, NO.

39:42.150 --> 39:43.752
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

39:43.752 --> 39:45.754
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE,
BUT, UH,

39:45.754 --> 39:49.458
THERE WAS JUST A TIME WHERE
I THOUGHT I MIGHT LOSE IT.

39:49.458 --> 39:51.460
OH, MY GOD.
AND THERE I WAS,

39:51.460 --> 39:53.462
JUST BUGGING YOU
ABOUT YOUR DOCTOR.

39:53.462 --> 39:56.094
I AM SO SORRY.
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD ME.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.596
NO, YOU'RE PREGNANT, TOO.

39:57.596 --> 40:00.769
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING
THAT'S GONNA WORRY YOU.

40:00.769 --> 40:02.471
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?

40:02.471 --> 40:04.773
IT'S THE FIRST BABY I'VE HAD
IN 17 YEARS.

40:04.773 --> 40:07.776
YOU KNOW, I COULD NOT POSSIBLY
BE MORE FREAKED OUT.
 MM.

40:07.776 --> 40:09.978
THIS MORNING,
I CAUGHT MIKE BUILDING A CRIB.

40:09.978 --> 40:11.440
NO. THIS EARLY?

40:11.440 --> 40:13.442
YEAH! I-I WANTED TO SCREAM.

40:13.442 --> 40:17.646
YOU KNOW, ARE YOU NUTS?
DO YOU JUST WANNA JINX IT?

40:17.646 --> 40:20.649
THIS IS WHAT WE GET
FOR HAVING KIDS AT OUR AGE--

40:20.649 --> 40:23.091
ANXIETY, TERROR.

40:23.091 --> 40:25.093
IT'S JUST GONNA GET WORSE.

40:25.093 --> 40:27.756
DO YOU KNOW, WHEN OUR BABIES
GO TO COLLEGE,

40:27.756 --> 40:29.528
WE'LL BE LIKE...

40:29.528 --> 40:30.629
DEAD?

40:30.629 --> 40:33.902
(laughs) IF WE'RE LUCKY.

40:33.902 --> 40:35.504
MM.

40:38.607 --> 40:40.539
LOOK AT US.

40:40.539 --> 40:44.613
PREGNANT GALS, EATING CAKE
AND BITCHIN'. (laughs)

40:44.613 --> 40:46.174
IT'S KINDA NICE, HUH?

40:46.174 --> 40:48.577
IT REALLY IS.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.055
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40:57.055 --> 41:01.459
THE HOSPITAL CALLED.
MY AUNT'S READY TO COME HOME.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.562
AND YOU WANT HER
TO STAY IN HERE?

41:03.562 --> 41:07.596
YEAH. I THINK MAKING THIS ROOM
OFF-LIMITS WAS A MISTAKE.

41:07.596 --> 41:10.599
IF I WANT DYLAN
TO FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS,

41:10.599 --> 41:13.101
I REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT
LESS INTRIGUING.

41:13.101 --> 41:17.145
SPEAKING OF INTRIGUING,

41:17.145 --> 41:19.648
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
LAST NIGHT?

41:19.648 --> 41:22.611
WHAT?

41:22.611 --> 41:24.883
COME ON. "THE WORST THING
A FATHER COULD DO"?

41:24.883 --> 41:27.055
YOU REALIZE WHAT PEOPLE
ARE GONNA THINK.

41:27.055 --> 41:31.660
YEAH. THEY'RE GONNA BE
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,

41:31.660 --> 41:34.623
AND UNCOMFORTABLE PEOPLE
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

41:44.633 --> 41:46.535
(children screaming
and shouting)

41:46.535 --> 41:50.138
ALL CHILDREN LOVE GAMES.

41:50.138 --> 41:53.542
BUT CHILDREN GROW UP,

41:53.542 --> 41:57.185
AND THEN THEY FIND
NEW GAMES TO PLAY.

41:57.185 --> 42:00.919
THEY PRETEND TO BE WELL
SO THEIR FAMILIES WON'T WORRY.

42:03.652 --> 42:05.654
THEY LIE TO THEIR LOVERS

42:05.654 --> 42:08.727
ABOUT WHERE THEY GO
IN THE AFTERNOON.

42:08.727 --> 42:11.860
SO ANYWAY, THAT'S WHY
IT WAS SO GREAT.
 OH!

42:11.860 --> 42:14.863
THEY INVENT STORIES TO HIDE
THE TRUTH FROM THEIR FRIENDS.

42:14.863 --> 42:17.936
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
OH, ONE MORE. HERE YOU GO.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.609
YES...

42:20.609 --> 42:25.714
EVERYONE HAS FUN PLAYING GAMES,

42:25.714 --> 42:28.947
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT...

42:28.947 --> 42:30.218
(gasps)

42:30.218 --> 42:33.081
SOMEONE GETS HURT.

42:36.284 --> 42:38.286
(sobbing)
