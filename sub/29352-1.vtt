00:44.712 --> 00:48.414
<i>Potter's Bluff.</i>

00:48.416 --> 00:51.316
<i>What's left of it.</i>

00:51.318 --> 00:56.422
<i>Population... decimated by
a deadly wasting disease.</i>

00:56.424 --> 00:59.324
<i>It all started with a weird
black gut rot,</i>

00:59.326 --> 01:03.328
<i>and always ended the same way.</i>

01:03.330 --> 01:07.733
<i>In just a few weeks,
all our parents were gone.</i>

01:07.735 --> 01:10.469
<i>Us East Side kids,
we stuck together</i>

01:10.471 --> 01:13.205
<i>and tried to pretend
everything was normal.</i>

01:13.207 --> 01:17.076
<i>But it didn't take long
before the town split in two.</i>

01:17.078 --> 01:19.211
<i>Poor kids on the East Side
of the bridge,</i>

01:19.213 --> 01:22.114
<i>rich kids on the other.</i>

01:22.116 --> 01:26.618
<i>The West Side is now
Titan territory.</i>

01:28.522 --> 01:32.157
<i>It's just us kids left now.</i>

01:32.159 --> 01:33.759
<i>And we're just trying
to stay alive.</i>

02:52.673 --> 02:55.340
Fuck, yeah.

03:03.484 --> 03:07.953
Oh, my fucking Jesus Christ.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.856
Nat?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.658
I'm in here.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.567
Ready to go?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.535
Uh, yeah, basically.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.470
Cool, 'cause I want
to show you something?

03:25.472 --> 03:27.239
Is it gonna make us late again?

03:27.241 --> 03:29.975
I guarantee you it's worth it.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.244
It better be.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.548
Whoa, hold up.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.925
Oh, my God.
That is fucking disgusting!

03:46.927 --> 03:49.294
Man, put it down.

03:49.296 --> 03:52.431
God.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.337
It's loaded.

04:04.612 --> 04:08.480
I thought there was something
you wanted to show me?

04:09.683 --> 04:12.351
Follow me.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.740
Oh!

04:34.742 --> 04:37.342
Fuck.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.983
Fuck!

04:44.985 --> 04:47.352
Hey, hey!

04:47.354 --> 04:48.887
Hey!

04:48.889 --> 04:51.556
You all right? You okay?

04:51.558 --> 04:52.958
Oh, fuck.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.893
You think you can stand up?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.428
Yeah.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.364
Yeah? I can help you up.
I'll help you up.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.767
What the fuck you doing
all the way out here?

05:01.769 --> 05:03.302
Hey, hey, hey.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.304
It's okay.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.672
I'm not gonna hurt you.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.040
They were chasing me.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.508
Titans?

05:14.581 --> 05:16.882
Okay.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.417
Oh, fuck!

05:18.419 --> 05:20.519
Okay, look, I got to
be somewhere right now,

05:20.521 --> 05:22.688
and you can't stay here.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.090
Come on.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.630
Seriously?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.832
Come on.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.744
Hey.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.479
Hi.

05:47.481 --> 05:51.350
Oh, my God.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.984
She's friendly, too.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.622
Oh, Jack will never
let us keep him.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.558
Fuck Jack.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.960
You always say that.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.896
Where are we going?

06:04.898 --> 06:07.499
I got to make a delivery.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.106
Hold on.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.654
It's gonna be safer
if you stay in here.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.956
Safer?

06:30.958 --> 06:33.091
But I thought you were
just making a delivery.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.984
What the fuck?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.919
Get the fuck out of the van!

07:00.921 --> 07:02.120
Hey!

07:13.734 --> 07:17.502
Ugh!

07:23.444 --> 07:27.646
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

07:36.957 --> 07:38.957
Argh!

08:05.886 --> 08:09.754
There was only supposed to be
one guy.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.926
There's only ever one guy.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.073
Oh, fuck.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.508
Come on.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.929
Hey.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.098
Look what I got.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.165
Last one, right?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.034
Last one.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.871
Hey, Luce.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.110
Why would they send two guys
for a bunch of water?

09:05.112 --> 09:09.014
Unless there's something
important in that van.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.049
Something else valuable.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.953
Worth protecting.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.656
Then, you got to go back.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.759
I know.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.728
Thanks, Luce.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.730
It's not too deep.
You'll be okay.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.133
There's some water tanks
outside. You'll see them.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.735
Thank you.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.839
What the fuck, Jack?

09:34.841 --> 09:36.575
What?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.743
You can't just keep bringing
random people in here.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.312
It's not safe.

09:40.314 --> 09:44.349
Sunshine, I hit him
with the goddamn truck, okay?

09:46.119 --> 09:49.988
You weren't there,
but I trust him.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.794
And you trust me, don't you?
Huh?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.029
You're not going back
for that van, though, okay?

09:59.633 --> 10:00.899
All right.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.701
No, seriously, I mean it.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.737
You're not going back, promise.

10:05.739 --> 10:09.174
All right, I promise, baby.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.942
All right?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.078
The board's all set up.
Wanna see it?

10:13.080 --> 10:16.615
You're damn straight I do.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.016
Hey, sorry, we missed dinner.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.051
Yeah, sorry.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.920
Where were you guys?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.254
Over at the elementary school.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.689
Yeah, the elementary school.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.192
What was that?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.793
Uh, what was what?

10:28.795 --> 10:31.262
Fuck off, what was it?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.398
Where's Jack?

10:37.337 --> 10:39.104
Seriously, guys?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.739
Again, you can't
keep doing this.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.841
You don't have to tell him.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.343
Sunshine, have I ever told you,

10:45.345 --> 10:47.245
you are the coolest person
that I know?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.180
I respect you.
Learn from you every day...

10:49.182 --> 10:52.283
Yeah, okay, just get it out
of here before he sees it, okay?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.652
Before he sees what?

10:53.654 --> 10:54.886
Nothing!

10:54.888 --> 10:57.288
Yeah, right, you bunch of liars.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.159
I need to have a look
at you, too.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.695
How much of this blood is yours?

11:03.697 --> 11:07.165
Beats me.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.200
Hey, what's that?
Was that a scratch?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.736
What should we name you,
little guys, huh?

11:11.738 --> 11:14.939
You're so cute.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.808
That's a cute dog.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.043
Who the fuck are you?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.345
I'm Sony. Jack brought me here.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.148
Let me guess,
you needed help of some kind?

11:23.150 --> 11:24.849
He hit me with his truck.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.786
Fucking typical.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.721
You're Nat, right?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.856
Yeah, why?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.792
What did my asshole brother
say about me?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.093
I mean, nothing bad.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.028
Just that you guys
were staying here together,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.029
which is cool.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.031
Sony.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.700
It's nice to meet you

11:41.702 --> 11:43.134
and you should feel
welcome here.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.869
Truth is,
we all found this place

11:44.871 --> 11:46.805
because Jack helped us
in some way,

11:46.807 --> 11:48.840
brought us together,

11:48.842 --> 11:51.009
but let me make you a promise.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.913
If you tell Jack about this dog,

11:54.915 --> 11:56.948
I'll fucking kill you.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.084
I will knife you in your sleep.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.922
Is that clear?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.123
Okay.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.328
Nice to meet you.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.931
Nice to meet you.

13:50.230 --> 13:54.399
You are Titans in training,
all of you.

13:54.401 --> 13:58.236
And when you're ready, I want
you to come and work for me.

13:58.238 --> 14:02.273
But in order to do that,
you have to keep training hard,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.876
doing your very best.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.378
No matter how tough it is,

14:07.380 --> 14:09.881
no matter how much you want
to give up,

14:09.883 --> 14:14.285
you can never accept defeat.

14:14.287 --> 14:19.290
Because quitters can never
become champions,

14:19.292 --> 14:23.561
everyone knows that.

14:23.563 --> 14:31.563
And to be a Titan,
you must be a champion.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.278
Something's not right.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.881
Van's a no-show.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.456
The van's a no-show.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.991
Fuck.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.926
What did I tell you?

14:54.928 --> 14:58.329
Someone around here
has a really big mouth.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.998
I'll take care of it.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.467
If it's not back by
the morning, you got to go.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.036
Shut that shit down.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.206
I can go, too.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.074
No.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.477
No, Devon, you stay here.

15:20.487 --> 15:24.455
There's something else.

15:24.457 --> 15:29.294
Distribution of herbal
contraband? Again?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.396
I guess, if you say so.

15:31.398 --> 15:35.300
Don't be smart with me, Madge,
I'm not in the fucking mood.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.502
How much was it this time?

15:37.504 --> 15:39.504
Half a quarter.
Big fuckin' whoop.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.039
Fish?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.441
Hey, what do you have to say
about it?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.143
Wasn't us.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.478
Well, that's shitty,

15:47.480 --> 15:50.615
because you're the one who's
going to have to pay for it.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.550
Seriously?

15:52.552 --> 15:55.320
For a half quarter,
you can't just let us go?

15:55.322 --> 15:56.688
I mean, you've done it before.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.323
So, I've done it before,

15:58.325 --> 16:00.391
that doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want

16:00.393 --> 16:02.327
and I'm just gonna look
the other way.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.162
I thought you were the nice guy.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.564
Guess I was wrong.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.970
Look, guys.

16:11.972 --> 16:15.106
Selling that amount of weed
without Jeremy's approval

16:15.108 --> 16:19.677
is an automatic two-month
offense, you know this.

16:21.114 --> 16:26.184
Okay, but this time, Madge,
here's the deal.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.121
You get to go home, walk out
that door free as a bird.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.024
See, that's me being nice,
right?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.460
'Cause Fish here is gonna do
your time for you.

16:35.462 --> 16:39.230
So, that's your two months
plus his two months.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.999
Four months detention?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.300
Come on, it wasn't us.

16:42.302 --> 16:46.704
Sucks to be you.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.439
Go. Get out.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.174
You can't be fucking serious?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.677
Go back to Caine and tell her
this is what happens

16:52.679 --> 16:56.481
when she thinks the rules
don't apply to her.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.395
Don't fucking touch me!

17:21.775 --> 17:23.574
Where you going?

17:23.576 --> 17:25.710
Nowhere, just go back to bed.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.613
Fuck you.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.448
I got to go back, all right?

17:30.450 --> 17:33.084
I got to go see what's
in that van.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.753
What if there's
medical supplies?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.155
See, I've been thinking,

17:37.157 --> 17:38.689
and there's an open window
right now,

17:38.691 --> 17:42.293
and it's not gonna be dangerous
if I take it right now.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.762
All right?

17:44.764 --> 17:48.066
No one even knows that
the van's there, no one.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.202
Except the dead guys inside,
that's about it.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.505
You make me so fucking mad,
you know that?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.108
I'm not gonna be gone for long.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.213
Eventually, something's
gonna happen to you,

18:02.215 --> 18:06.284
and when it does,
what happens to the rest of us?

18:06.286 --> 18:10.088
Nothing's going to happen to me.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.163
Hey!

18:19.165 --> 18:20.865
What the fuck do you clowns
want?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.401
We were thinking if you boys
need some extra help,

18:23.403 --> 18:25.803
we can provide some firepower.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.641
Have a friendly proposition,
if you will.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.710
Uh, yeah.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.479
I think we're good.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.822
Just fucking do it already.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.324
Chill the fuck out.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.127
Hey.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.661
No flinching, man. Come on.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.264
Don't be a pussy, Kyle.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.334
Oh!

19:26.599 --> 19:28.599
For fuck's sakes.

19:38.912 --> 19:40.511
Lucy! What are you doing here?

19:40.513 --> 19:43.181
I feel bad, I wanna help.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.615
This was kinda all my fault.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.850
Did you follow me here?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.919
Stowed away in the back
of your truck.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.787
Well, get back there.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.189
It's dangerous out here.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.558
I almost fucking killed you.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.960
I still feel bad.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.310
Fuck.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.590
Holy shit!

20:35.235 --> 20:37.702
Who the fuck are you,

20:37.704 --> 20:40.972
and how did you know
about this truck?

20:40.974 --> 20:42.506
Hey, guys.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.243
Calm down.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.644
It's totally okay.

20:46.646 --> 20:50.915
I can explain everything.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.821
Get the fuck out.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.423
Now.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.334
You're coming with us.

21:10.336 --> 21:13.004
All right.

21:13.006 --> 21:16.874
Let's go.

21:16.876 --> 21:20.678
Let's go.
Let's taking a fucking drive.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.520
I told him not to go back.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.389
What? What's going on?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.923
The Titans took Jack.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.993
Yeah, he went back to search
that goddamn van.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.730
Shit.
Scratch and I'll go find him.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.998
No, no, no way.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.566
I don't want you guys
risking it,

21:42.568 --> 21:43.934
and I can't lose you two,
as well.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.503
We have to do something.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.904
No, you're not going.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.639
Well, what other choice
do we have?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.007
Yeah, we can't just abandon him.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.776
Okay, I said no!

21:51.778 --> 21:53.778
Well, you can't stop us.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.317
What, are you going to bribe
them with whiskey?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.852
It's worth a shot.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.922
He's my brother,
I can't just do nothing.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.729
Just don't do anything
extra dumb, okay?

22:11.731 --> 22:13.931
You know I can't promise that.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.434
Just take care of him, okay?

22:16.436 --> 22:18.936
Seriously, please be careful.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.668
Oh!

22:53.706 --> 22:56.374
Welcome home.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.534
What?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.068
Good news.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.738
I got him.

24:00.740 --> 24:06.710
He's being taken to the
gym, as we speak!

24:10.049 --> 24:12.183
Great work, Todd.

24:12.185 --> 24:16.654
Really, great work.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.031
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.700
We'll find him.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.069
I know.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.172
Come back with Jack,
or we come back dead.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.074
Deal? Deal.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.944
Wait! Hey, wait! Wait.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.179
I want to come with you guys.
I want to help.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.581
No. Why?

24:43.583 --> 24:45.983
Look, he saved my life.
I owe him.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.219
Fuck off, dude,
we just met you last night.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.754
Yeah, I think we're gonna do
this on our own.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.022
I'm from the West Side.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.991
Okay, I can help you guys.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.894
Motherfucker, I knew there was
a good reason I didn't like you.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.762
Hold on.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.131
Seriously, when was the last
time you were on the West Side?

25:01.133 --> 25:02.566
What does that fuckin' matter?

25:02.568 --> 25:03.734
It matters.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.269
Do we even know
where we're going?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.104
Or where they took him?

25:07.106 --> 25:08.973
We'll figure it out.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.609
Come on, I think
we might need him.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.948
Fine.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.917
Okay.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.887
You guys know you can't bike
the whole way there, right?

25:22.889 --> 25:25.990
Relax, I know a guy.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.933
<i>We are Titans.</i>

25:35.935 --> 25:37.701
<i>We are champions.</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:41.071
<i>Our motto is strength,
power, respect.</i>

25:44.277 --> 25:45.943
<i>We are Titans.</i>

25:45.945 --> 25:47.678
<i>We are champions.</i>

25:47.680 --> 25:51.282
<i>Our motto is strength,
power, respect.</i>

25:53.853 --> 25:55.653
<i>We are Titans.</i>

25:55.655 --> 25:57.154
<i>We are champions.</i>

25:57.156 --> 26:00.558
<i>Our motto is strength,
power, respect.</i>

26:00.560 --> 26:02.092
Ugh.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.762
<i>We are Titans.</i>

26:04.764 --> 26:06.630
<i>We are champions.</i>

26:06.632 --> 26:08.265
<i>Our motto is strength,
power, respect.</i>

26:13.072 --> 26:14.772
<i>We are Titans.</i>

26:14.774 --> 26:16.273
<i>We are champions.</i>

26:16.275 --> 26:18.142
<i>Our motto is strength,
power, respect.</i>

26:18.144 --> 26:21.946
He's ready if you want to get
him, bring him to the gym.

26:31.724 --> 26:36.260
So, this is the guy who killed
two of my Titans.

26:38.831 --> 26:42.066
Trying to steal my batteries?

26:42.068 --> 26:44.268
He says no.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.171
Of course he does.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.873
I didn't do anything.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.276
Shh...

26:53.613 --> 26:56.080
Don't talk.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.392
Do you know who this is?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.228
No.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.831
Not you.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.970
Do you recognize him?

27:19.972 --> 27:23.040
Well, you should.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.142
Because this is
the guy who's responsible

27:25.144 --> 27:27.678
for telling
East Side shitheads like you

27:27.680 --> 27:30.114
where and when to take my stuff.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.082
No, Jeremy, that's not true!

27:32.084 --> 27:33.784
I didn't do anything!

27:33.786 --> 27:36.286
I'm loyal to you, you know me.

27:36.288 --> 27:41.358
Sean, you're the head
of my transport operation

27:41.360 --> 27:45.162
and your department
is leaky as fuck.

27:47.299 --> 27:51.001
Now, whether it's you
or someone who works for you,

27:51.003 --> 27:55.272
I don't know,
but it's got to stop.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.908
And it stops today.

28:02.281 --> 28:09.119
Sean, you seem stressed.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.355
Aww, it's okay. It's all right.

28:11.357 --> 28:16.360
Remember, what do we do
when we feel weakness?

28:19.398 --> 28:22.032
We breathe.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.911
Ahh!

28:45.424 --> 28:47.491
Say goodnight.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.818
You feel me, bro?

29:59.131 --> 30:02.032
So, what do we do if he doesn't
have what we need?

30:02.034 --> 30:03.934
He will.

30:03.936 --> 30:07.104
He owes me.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.808
Hey, Bacon! You here, buddy?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.479
Ahh!

30:17.349 --> 30:19.516
What's up, Scratch?
What's up, buddy?

30:19.518 --> 30:21.451
I want to cash in, is that cool?

30:21.453 --> 30:24.221
Yeah, that's cool, absolutely.
What ya looking for, exactly?

30:24.223 --> 30:28.458
Some wheels, some gas in
the tank, something with kick.

30:28.460 --> 30:33.197
Yeah, I think I got something
for you. Come with me.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.611
I don't like being fucked with,
Bacon.

30:47.613 --> 30:52.516
Scratch, what are you talking
about? I ain't fucking with you.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.485
Ow! Ow! That's all I got!
I swear!

30:55.487 --> 30:57.454
Bullshit! I know you're lying!

30:57.456 --> 30:58.889
I don't have anything else!

30:58.891 --> 30:59.957
Come on, Bacon!

30:59.959 --> 31:02.993
Ow! Ow! I don't have anything!

31:02.995 --> 31:04.995
Okay, it's in the barn!

31:04.997 --> 31:07.331
Fuck, my nipple!

31:10.302 --> 31:13.437
Holy mother of fuck.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.885
Whoa. What's in here?

31:27.887 --> 31:29.519
Stuff. Don't open it.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.457
Is this really necessary,
Scratch?

31:33.459 --> 31:36.627
Yeah, it's really
fucking dangerous out there.

31:36.629 --> 31:40.430
Just for emergencies then, okay?

31:59.485 --> 32:03.487
Don't say a fucking word, okay?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.421
Don't try anything stupid,
all right?

32:37.423 --> 32:39.957
This is just so you can eat.

33:21.066 --> 33:23.000
What's on this?

34:14.085 --> 34:17.487
Hey, guys, turn the music off.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.590
Okay, we're coming up to a Titan
toll booth. So, just slow down.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.391
What do we do?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.628
We're just going to stop the car
and do what they say, okay?

34:24.630 --> 34:26.396
No way, fuck that.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.880
Scratch, seriously.

34:27.882 --> 34:29.364
They're not going to
just let us drive on through.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.134
No, they will.
Look, I'm with you guys.

34:31.136 --> 34:33.170
Just let me talk to them,
seriously.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.105
That's the whole reason
we brought him here

34:35.107 --> 34:37.340
in the first place, isn't it?
To help us with shit like this?

34:37.342 --> 34:39.076
Look, if we
blow past these guys,

34:39.078 --> 34:42.712
we'll have the entire
Titan force looking for us.

34:42.714 --> 34:43.746
Fine.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.683
Thank you.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.185
Hey, how's it going?

35:24.690 --> 35:27.290
Everyone out of the vehicle,
please.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.825
It's totally okay.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.661
They just wants everybody
to get out and stand.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.768
Thanks.

35:40.873 --> 35:42.772
Hey.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.407
Jackpot.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.443
Where're you headed?

35:46.445 --> 35:48.578
I just live over on
Fanshawe and Royal Palm.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.280
So, we're just headed
to my place.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.415
What were you doing
on the East Side then?

35:52.417 --> 35:53.917
We were just, uhh, looking...

35:53.919 --> 35:56.686
My brother. He's gone missing.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.588
You find him?

35:58.590 --> 36:01.424
No, not yet.

36:01.426 --> 36:04.227
Huh.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.910
Okay, well, you can go.

36:19.912 --> 36:23.413
Hope you find your brother.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.915
Really? We can go?

36:24.917 --> 36:28.418
Okay, cool, well,
have a great day.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.855
Just give us a minute.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.791
Hey.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.225
You're going to
have to come with us.

36:36.228 --> 36:37.861
Why?
Yeah, you just said we can go.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.197
You can, just got to ask her
a couple questions.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.264
What the fuck?

36:41.266 --> 36:42.599
Hey, hey!

36:42.601 --> 36:44.768
Let me go!
Hey, hey, leave her alone!

36:44.770 --> 36:46.403
Shut the fuck up.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.405
Fuck off.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.606
Fucking bitch.

36:49.608 --> 36:54.744
Off! Get the fuck...
Keep fighting.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.380
Fuck off! Get the fuck off!

37:08.427 --> 37:09.893
Stop!

37:09.895 --> 37:10.994
Shut the fuck up!

38:01.046 --> 38:04.514
You okay?

38:04.516 --> 38:06.349
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.454
Let's get the fuck out of here.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.968
Open it.

38:32.644 --> 38:36.446
Hey.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.583
Fuck.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.938
You know, you're really going to
regret pulling shit like that.

39:40.679 --> 39:43.646
Smooth move, cheese dick.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.149
Un-fucking-believable.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.748
It's so... Clean.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.151
Creepy.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.753
Who are they?

40:25.056 --> 40:27.557
Westsiders.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.531
Shit.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.433
What?

40:36.435 --> 40:38.701
We're out of gas.

40:38.703 --> 40:43.606
Fuck, okay, we should get out,
right now, come on.

40:54.219 --> 40:57.754
Go. Go.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.641
Those are varsity bikes.

41:20.645 --> 41:24.481
I thought only guards
have those.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.531
Hey.

41:41.533 --> 41:42.899
Are you fucking kidding me?

41:42.901 --> 41:45.969
We seriously thought
you were dead, dude.

41:51.643 --> 41:53.776
Who are they?

41:53.778 --> 41:56.946
This is Nat.
And this is Scratch.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.581
They're from the East Side.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.583
The East Side? For real?

42:00.585 --> 42:01.885
Yeah.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.120
Cool.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.856
So, that's where you've been
for two days?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.825
Yeah, couple of Titans caught
me trying

42:08.827 --> 42:11.861
to cut across Main Street
and chased me for miles,

42:11.863 --> 42:14.864
before her brother picked me up
in his truck

42:14.866 --> 42:17.967
on the other side of the border,
saved my life.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.536
It's good to be home though.

42:19.538 --> 42:22.272
Where's Fish?
Is he... Is he inside?

42:22.274 --> 42:26.276
They pulled us in again,
total assholes.

42:26.278 --> 42:28.611
Okay, so, why are you here
and he's not?

42:28.613 --> 42:30.313
Devon wanted to send a message.

42:30.315 --> 42:32.916
We got it, loud and clear.

42:32.918 --> 42:35.118
I thought we were done
with that shit.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.754
We are. We talked about it.

42:37.756 --> 42:38.988
Okay, you know what, Sony?

42:38.990 --> 42:40.823
You fucked up
and crossed Main Street.

42:40.825 --> 42:43.793
And I fucked up and got caught
with a baggie. It happens, okay?

42:43.795 --> 42:46.095
You say that like you have
no control over it though.

42:46.097 --> 42:47.830
Okay, shut up, both of you.

42:52.137 --> 42:55.204
You guys want some food?

42:55.206 --> 43:00.209
Look, we've got another problem.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.187
They'll be holding him at the
high school,

43:11.189 --> 43:13.356
no doubt about it, most likely
in their "A" block.

43:13.358 --> 43:16.059
It's heavily fortified because
it's Jeremy's headquarters,

43:16.061 --> 43:18.227
literally overflowing
with Titan guards.

43:18.229 --> 43:19.963
I've been held there a shit ton.

43:19.965 --> 43:22.098
And I promise you
the trouble's not getting in.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.199
It's getting out.

43:23.201 --> 43:25.134
But luckily for us, by now,

43:25.136 --> 43:27.236
she's got
the floor plan memorized.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.739
So, do we go now?

43:29.741 --> 43:31.774
No, I got people on the inside.

43:31.776 --> 43:35.278
Put the word out we're looking
for him, see what I hear back.

43:35.280 --> 43:37.880
Until then, just relax.

43:41.987 --> 43:45.088
We'll find him, promise.

43:48.226 --> 43:51.060
I got a really bad feeling
about this.

43:51.062 --> 43:54.631
Why? You heard her.
They're going to help us.

43:54.633 --> 43:55.999
Yeah, and in the meantime,

43:56.001 --> 43:58.334
we're supposed to
sit around and relax?

43:58.336 --> 44:01.070
I don't fucking think so.

44:23.194 --> 44:26.129
You see, the thing is,
you know that I'm right.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.731
You do fuck up, all the time.

44:30.835 --> 44:33.069
I fuck up sometimes, yeah.

44:33.071 --> 44:36.072
I can't believe
you just now admit that!

44:36.074 --> 44:39.742
Sometimes, Madge, sometimes.

44:39.744 --> 44:44.247
Okay, so, Nat, first time
to the West Side since...

44:44.249 --> 44:47.684
Well, you know,
what do you think?

44:47.686 --> 44:51.354
I don't know yet. Super weird?

44:51.356 --> 44:53.923
Yeah, let me tell you,
lot of rules on the West Side.

44:53.925 --> 44:55.825
In here though,
we do our own thing.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.960
Caine wants to take down
Jeremy and the Titans,

44:57.962 --> 44:59.362
which is totally cool.

44:59.364 --> 45:03.700
But me? I just want to get high.

45:05.070 --> 45:07.036
Okay, for real though,
can we talk

45:07.038 --> 45:08.771
about the East Side
for a second?

45:08.773 --> 45:10.373
'Cause I have some questions.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.408
'Kay, what have you heard?

45:12.410 --> 45:14.377
Let me tell you, nothing good.

45:27.092 --> 45:29.192
So, Todd told me
what happened this afternoon.

45:33.131 --> 45:35.064
Here's the thing.

45:35.066 --> 45:39.168
To be a Titan

45:39.170 --> 45:42.004
means to be something special.

45:42.006 --> 45:44.407
Would you agree
with that statement?

45:44.409 --> 45:47.844
Absolutely.

45:47.846 --> 45:51.881
And what do we have
that others don't have?

45:51.883 --> 45:55.818
That binds us together?

45:55.820 --> 46:00.289
Strength, power, respect.

46:00.291 --> 46:03.126
So, when someone
sees you wearing

46:03.128 --> 46:05.928
this varsity jacket,

46:05.930 --> 46:10.366
it means you are a Titan.

46:10.368 --> 46:14.337
And you demand respect.

46:14.339 --> 46:17.240
I do. I agree.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.375
Do you?

46:19.377 --> 46:21.277
Yes.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.946
Because I put you in charge
of "A" block

46:23.948 --> 46:25.815
because I thought
it was something

46:25.817 --> 46:27.383
your weak ass could handle.

46:27.385 --> 46:32.355
But now you're just
making me look bad.

46:32.357 --> 46:36.492
Jeremy, I swear to God, okay,
he wasn't moving.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.194
He looked like he was dead.

46:38.196 --> 46:41.330
I need you
to understand something.

46:41.332 --> 46:44.167
It's all connected.

46:44.169 --> 46:49.105
Someone only tries to escape
from "A" block,

46:49.107 --> 46:51.440
to take a risk like that,

46:51.442 --> 46:56.345
because they see weakness,

46:56.347 --> 46:58.915
weakness they can
take advantage of.

46:58.917 --> 47:01.050
They don't respect you

47:01.052 --> 47:06.055
because they can see your guards
don't respect you,

47:06.057 --> 47:08.524
not really,

47:08.526 --> 47:10.927
certainly not enough
to keep the jail door locked

47:10.929 --> 47:13.196
or the prisoner inside,

47:13.198 --> 47:16.199
which is literally
their only fucking job!

47:19.938 --> 47:22.371
I know. I fucked up.

47:22.373 --> 47:25.608
I'm sorry.

47:28.613 --> 47:32.281
Devon,

47:32.283 --> 47:36.018
the only reason
you're not dead right now...

47:38.423 --> 47:43.192
is because you're my cousin.

47:47.498 --> 47:52.235
Now get out.

47:52.237 --> 47:56.272
You heard him.
Get the fuck out of here.

48:15.393 --> 48:18.294
We have something significant
to report.

48:18.296 --> 48:20.663
I can't help you guys.

48:20.665 --> 48:22.598
There are three
stolen varsity bikes

48:22.600 --> 48:24.567
and three dead bodies
at the toll booth,

48:24.569 --> 48:26.302
stolen bikes
that can be tracked back

48:26.304 --> 48:28.437
to Caine's grandmother's place
just over an hour ago.

48:28.439 --> 48:32.508
How would you like us
to proceed?

48:34.279 --> 48:36.312
Hey,
remember how to play asshole?

48:36.314 --> 48:38.247
Just deal the cards.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.016
Wait. That's my job, okay.

48:43.922 --> 48:46.355
Come play.

48:46.357 --> 48:49.125
No, I got to talk to you.

48:49.127 --> 48:51.160
Okay, about what?

48:51.162 --> 48:54.397
Are you that fucking high
you forgot why we're here?

48:54.399 --> 48:58.067
I haven't fucking forgotten.
Keep your panties on.

49:01.372 --> 49:04.040
I've seen the same bike
pass here three times now.

49:04.042 --> 49:06.242
I really think we should be
changing locations.

49:06.244 --> 49:09.211
No, look, bike patrols
are pretty routine in this area.

49:09.213 --> 49:12.048
It's seriously nothing to worry
about. It's totally normal.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.683
No offence, Sony,
but after this morning,

49:13.685 --> 49:17.987
I could give even less of a shit
about anything you have to say,

49:17.989 --> 49:20.189
which includes what you think
is totally normal

49:20.191 --> 49:22.275
and nothing to worry about.

49:22.276 --> 49:24.360
So, why don't you do me a favour
and fuck off, okay?

49:27.565 --> 49:28.698
Nat, come on.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.233
No.

49:31.235 --> 49:33.569
No, I'm playing
a fucking harmless card game.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.071
There's no one outside.

49:35.073 --> 49:37.006
Why don't you bring it down,
for once,

49:37.008 --> 49:41.444
from, like, a twelve out of ten
to maybe a four? Jesus fuck.

49:41.446 --> 49:45.681
There's people out there looking
for us. They want to kill us.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.483
Yeah, and who's fault is that?

49:51.422 --> 49:54.557
Seriously?

49:54.559 --> 49:57.727
That guy was...
He going to rape you.

49:57.729 --> 49:59.762
No, I had him.

49:59.764 --> 50:02.531
Nat, I was there.
You did not fucking have him.

50:02.533 --> 50:05.301
Yeah, well, you didn't have to
kill him and the others

50:05.303 --> 50:08.004
like you're some sort of
fucking psycho.

50:08.006 --> 50:10.506
"Fucking psycho"?

50:10.508 --> 50:14.276
No, I just... You scared me.

50:14.278 --> 50:16.479
You acted before you even
thought about the consequences.

50:16.481 --> 50:19.615
And that's just what you do,
Scratch. You don't think.

50:19.617 --> 50:23.486
I was thinking about you,
like I always do.

50:23.488 --> 50:26.322
Well, you don't have to,
you know?

50:26.323 --> 50:29.157
I can do things by myself.
You're not my boyfriend.

50:33.164 --> 50:34.164
Fuck you.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.657
Go away.

51:06.364 --> 51:10.533
What?

51:12.703 --> 51:16.172
Fuck off.

51:16.174 --> 51:19.241
Listen. I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

51:19.243 --> 51:20.743
You're right.

51:20.745 --> 51:23.279
What happened at the toll booth,
that was... that was...

51:23.281 --> 51:26.415
Are you fucking kidding me
with this right now?

51:26.417 --> 51:28.217
I want you to know
that we're both here

51:28.219 --> 51:33.322
because we want the same thing.

51:33.324 --> 51:39.829
Scratch, we're on the same side.

51:43.634 --> 51:45.668
What the fuck?

51:55.746 --> 51:57.746
They've got Fish.

51:57.748 --> 52:02.585
I want the people who killed
the guards at the toll booth.

52:02.587 --> 52:04.186
I know they're here.

52:04.188 --> 52:07.423
It'll be easier
if you just hand them over.

52:07.425 --> 52:08.691
They're here for us.

52:08.693 --> 52:11.393
We should...
We should go out there.

52:11.395 --> 52:13.195
No fucking way.

52:13.197 --> 52:15.898
He's shit out of luck 'cause
I haven't seen you in days.

52:15.900 --> 52:19.335
And I've never met
these two before.

52:19.337 --> 52:22.471
Go. Your parents' place
isn't far from here. Go there.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.140
What about Fish?

52:24.142 --> 52:26.842
I'll handle Fish. You go.

52:26.844 --> 52:29.178
How are we supposed to
get out of here?

52:29.180 --> 52:30.546
Basement.

52:30.548 --> 52:32.348
Come with me. Come on.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.365
Caine!

52:49.367 --> 52:52.301
You're running out of time
for this to end well!

53:01.379 --> 53:03.345
Time's up!

53:15.560 --> 53:19.528
Okay, okay,

53:19.530 --> 53:24.400
let's just all take
a deep breath.

53:24.402 --> 53:28.470
Devon, I'm sorry to tell you.
But your intel's no good.

53:28.472 --> 53:33.375
There's no one here.

53:33.377 --> 53:37.513
Let's make a deal. Let Fish go.

53:37.515 --> 53:39.848
And you can have
anything you want.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.750
Don't try that.

53:41.752 --> 53:44.653
If you respected me, you would
have handed them over by now.

53:44.655 --> 53:46.322
Devon, they're not here.

53:47.925 --> 53:49.825
Don't make me do this.

53:49.827 --> 53:53.596
Hey, man, you don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

53:53.598 --> 53:56.332
You're not like
those other Titans.

53:56.334 --> 53:57.766
You're different. I know.

53:57.768 --> 54:00.369
What do you fucking know?
Please enlighten me.

54:02.373 --> 54:04.974
I know doing this,

54:04.976 --> 54:07.543
it's not going to
make you feel strong.

54:07.545 --> 54:09.511
Caine...

54:15.519 --> 54:16.619
No!

54:16.621 --> 54:17.753
Fish!

54:20.558 --> 54:22.524
Fish, Fish! Fish!

54:24.695 --> 54:26.629
You fucker!

54:27.632 --> 54:28.897
Madge!

54:28.899 --> 54:30.266
No!

54:30.268 --> 54:33.769
No, no!
Devon, what have you done?

54:33.771 --> 54:36.405
Come on. Come on.

54:36.407 --> 54:40.009
Fish, Fish. Fish, please.

54:40.011 --> 54:44.546
Just breathe, Fish. It's okay.

54:47.418 --> 54:50.586
Get her. Get her!

54:50.588 --> 54:53.622
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

54:53.624 --> 54:56.992
Get off me. Get off me!

54:56.994 --> 54:59.895
Fish.

55:19.417 --> 55:21.684
They were there.

55:21.686 --> 55:24.520
The bikes were there.

55:44.809 --> 55:46.775
After you.

55:49.980 --> 55:53.082
Whoa.

55:53.084 --> 55:55.884
You're still out, dude.

55:55.886 --> 55:59.855
What? What do you mean, "Out"?

55:59.857 --> 56:04.727
I mean Jeremy doesn't want
to see your face any more.

56:04.729 --> 56:07.096
And there's no fucking way
you're getting in,

56:07.098 --> 56:12.000
not when I'm here,
'cause I don't give a fuck

56:12.002 --> 56:16.739
who you just arrested
or what you just did.

56:16.741 --> 56:20.509
You're still
just a fucking loser,

56:20.511 --> 56:24.079
like you always have been.

56:24.081 --> 56:29.118
And Jeremy, he finally sees it.

56:31.922 --> 56:35.958
But I just killed two people.

56:35.960 --> 56:40.863
Like I said, you're still out.

56:51.175 --> 56:54.042
Harbouring fugitives,

56:54.044 --> 56:56.745
what the fuck were you thinking?

56:56.747 --> 56:59.548
I don't know
what you're talking about.

57:01.786 --> 57:06.789
Just tell me one thing.

57:10.060 --> 57:14.062
Why can't you just
do what you're told?

57:14.064 --> 57:16.098
Is that so goddamn hard?

57:18.669 --> 57:22.037
Don't you see how good
you have it over here?

57:23.808 --> 57:26.175
Can't you be grateful?

57:26.177 --> 57:28.210
For what?

57:30.815 --> 57:33.482
The pleasure of serving you?

57:36.053 --> 57:38.687
No, thanks.

57:38.689 --> 57:42.691
The West Side rules.

57:42.693 --> 57:47.196
The West Side sucks.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.472
Ring the bell.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.284
You know I didn't really mean

58:42.286 --> 58:44.753
that stuff I said earlier,
right?

58:50.060 --> 58:51.793
Come on, Scratch.

59:03.741 --> 59:07.109
Jack?

59:07.111 --> 59:10.112
How do you know my name?

59:45.015 --> 59:46.181
Hey.

59:46.183 --> 59:48.350
Hey.

59:48.352 --> 59:51.286
The propellers were supposed to
spin on their own.

59:51.288 --> 59:55.757
But this one didn't work
for some reason.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:04.132
Sony, I'm so sorry.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:20.949
Sony, I'm not...
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.653
That was really stupid of me.
I'm sorry...

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:27.756
No, no, it's okay.
It's not a big deal.

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:29.958
Okay, cool, cool.

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:37.733
Can... can you not tell Scratch
that I tried to kiss you?

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.337
Thanks.

01:01:08.732 --> 01:01:12.134
I shouldn't have said the things
I said and acted the way I did.

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:16.271
Whatever.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.907
No, I'm serious.

01:01:22.212 --> 01:01:24.079
You're not a psycho.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:30.452
I wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for you.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.425
I wouldn't be able to go on,

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:39.461
to keep living in
this fucking hell hole,

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:42.431
if it wasn't for you.

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:46.968
And right now, I might
be scared of so many things,

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:50.839
but more than anything,
I'm scared

01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:54.409
that you're never gonna
stop being mad at me.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:58.313
And I'm going to have to deal
with all this shit without you.

01:02:01.819 --> 01:02:05.487
So, I'm sorry for what I said.

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:09.191
But more than anything,

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:13.161
I'm sorry for making you
feel like I don't love you,

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:16.932
'cause I do.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.968
I love you.

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:31.079
It's okay, I understand
if you're still mad.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.063
You guys should come inside.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:09.851
We're gonna blend in,
then we're gonna break 'em out.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:12.120
But we got to motor.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.488
You know where we're going?

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:15.207
It's called 'A' block.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.925
It's made up of classrooms on
the north side of the school.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:20.962
That's where they'll
be keeping him.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:23.031
I can make it work.

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:26.134
Let's kick it.

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:30.438
They'll be here.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:36.111
What if something
happened to them?

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:37.312
No.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.881
Sony knows where we are.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:45.153
Fuck.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:50.325
No bags, backpacks,
purses, or totes!

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:51.593
Hands out of your pockets.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.995
And be prepared to be searched.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:06.241
Hey, I said no bags. Hey...

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:09.611
Hey, go after them!

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:16.084
This way, this way.

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:20.088
Oh, shit! Go!

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.128
Come on.

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.370
Shouldn't there be a guard here?

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.605
Yeah.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.309
Is he in there?

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.446
No. We're too late.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.977
Yeah! All right! Go, Titans, go!

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:18.346
Go, Titans, go!

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:22.550
Go, Titans, go! Go, Titans, go!

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.286
Go, Titans, go!
I can't hear you!

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:26.054
Go, Titans, go!

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:27.355
Go, Titans, go!

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:31.192
Go, Titans, go! Go, Titans, go!

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:32.460
Go, Titans, go!

01:05:32.462 --> 01:05:34.296
Is that coming from the gym?

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:36.131
If Jack's anywhere,
he'll be there.

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.966
Then, let's go.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.477
Okay, look, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna go this way,

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:50.979
take this one with me.

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.614
No. No, no, no.
It's fine, it's fine.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:55.483
Go to the gym, now.

01:05:55.485 --> 01:05:56.952
Good luck.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:59.321
Hey! Come on.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:01.122
Hey, motherfucker,
you should... oh!

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.399
Oh, fuck!

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.034
Nat!

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:19.607
No, little girl.
I don't think so.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.545
Hey!

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:24.679
Ah!

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.214
Ah!

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.086
Get the fuck outta here!

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:38.226
Come on.

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.031
Here.

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:52.540
You did good. Come on.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.509
Go, Titans, go! Go, Titans, go!

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:59.481
Westsiders, put your hands
together for...

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:04.152
the one, the only...

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:09.290
Jeremy.

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:25.507
It is so good to see you all.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:28.410
Thank you for coming.

01:07:28.412 --> 01:07:31.079
When we come together,

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:33.615
as we have throughout
these difficult times,

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:37.052
I have noticed
something incredible...

01:07:37.054 --> 01:07:41.089
That's that there's
nothing Westsiders can't do.

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:46.061
We are strong.

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:48.830
We are powerful.

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:52.467
And we are... champions!

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.784
Look at them.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:13.154
Two pieces of garbage, who think

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:16.224
that the rules
don't apply to them,

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.426
that they can take
whatever they want,

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:20.694
whenever they want it.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:27.569
But here on the West
Side, our home,

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:31.238
you can't go around
acting like that.

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:34.142
So, I thought it'd be good
for us to see what happens,

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:38.580
to people who think they can
live outside our system,

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:41.883
who think they don't need us.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:46.254
Let's see what
happens to those people.

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:50.524
I want you to watch.

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:54.828
And remember.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.366
Okay then.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.606
Let's begin!

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:07.274
You're up, Caine.

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.511
No.

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:12.514
Me first.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:04.499
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:08.903
What do we do? What do we do?

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.841
No! Stop!

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:19.347
Stay here. Watch my back.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:20.882
And use it if you have to.

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:23.952
No, no, no, no, wait!

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:46.674
You like that?!

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:47.842
Hey, fuckheads!

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:50.511
Be cool!
Everyone be fucking cool!

01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:54.882
Hey! Don't! Don't touch me!
Don't you fucking touch me!

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:03.858
Hey, you too, buddy.
Back the fuck up.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.294
Jack! Come on!

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:07.895
Hey. Hey, come on.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:10.265
Caine, let's go.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:12.033
Back the fuck up!

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:19.674
I will shoot this,
I promise you.

01:11:19.676 --> 01:11:21.442
Just let us walk out of here.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.644
Enough!

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:24.045
Sit down, fucko,

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:26.014
and your buddy here
doesn't have to die.

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:30.852
Jack, wake up! Let's go!

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:33.755
Fucko?

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:38.526
There is no way

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:40.628
I'm letting you
just walk in here,

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.397
make demands,

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:47.402
ruin my pep rally
and then just leave alive.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:50.038
There's just no fucking way!

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:56.744
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:01.382
Todd, kill this stupid bitch!

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.657
Jeremy...

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:18.599
What are you all looking at?!

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.503
Don't just stand there!

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:27.642
What the fuck is happening?!

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:57.672
Ah-ah-ah! Hey! Hey!

01:12:57.674 --> 01:13:03.811
Stop. Just... Nobody move.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.749
Go.

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:10.785
Get out!

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:20.094
Hey. Hey, come on. Get up.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.582
I'm in charge now.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.469
Okay.

01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:03.604
Things are gonna be
different around here.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.973
A lot different.

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:18.186
- Dude...
- Need a ride?

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:21.689
Get in.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.861
Thanks.

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:29.464
Any time.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.570
You know, Scratch,
you're one badass motherfucker.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:36.804
You know that?

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.873
You too, man.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:46.147
Okay. Okay.

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:48.049
Fuck...

01:14:51.788 --> 01:14:54.555
All right, let's get
the fuck outta here.

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:12.039
I guess you guys
can keep the puppy.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:17.078
You did it.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.780
We did it.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.056
Whoo-ooh!

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:16.050
