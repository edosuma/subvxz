44:26.507 --> 44:30.294
And so, whenever you see our
heroes up against any Reaper,

44:30.337 --> 44:32.209
it's not gonna be easy.

44:32.252 --> 44:40.652
[ Grunting ]

44:40.696 --> 44:43.220
We have never used a bell before
as a weapon.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.744
You know, there was this idea
of, like, well, you know,

44:45.788 --> 44:48.878
Maggie was a really good leader,
so she would've had, like,

44:48.921 --> 44:52.751
a primitive way of alerting
people, of like, sand

44:52.795 --> 44:57.495
so that you could kind of like,
dump it on a small fire.

44:57.538 --> 45:00.977
That became the makeshift weapon
that Negan uses.

45:01.020 --> 45:03.849
But I don't believe we've used
a bell other than that.

45:03.893 --> 45:07.244
Well, ding ding.

45:07.287 --> 45:09.681
We've been telling a story
with Gabriel

45:09.725 --> 45:12.945
about the struggle with his
faith and where is he

45:12.989 --> 45:17.210
with his feelings about God and
being a priest.

45:17.254 --> 45:20.170
Gabriel has had to do
so many things, recently,

45:20.213 --> 45:22.955
that feels so dark that he feels
like adrift

45:22.999 --> 45:25.479
and, like, he feels like
he's lost his sense

45:25.523 --> 45:28.308
of closeness to a higher power.

45:28.352 --> 45:31.311
And we thought, like, an
interesting test for Gabriel

45:31.355 --> 45:35.707
would be seeing somebody that is
a mirror in some ways, you know.

45:35.751 --> 45:38.275
Like, somebody who is also a
person of faith,

45:38.318 --> 45:42.018
but applying that faith in a
very particular direction.

45:42.061 --> 45:44.890
And, like, what does that mean
for Gabriel.

45:44.934 --> 45:49.329
In a previous episode,
he saw this minister out there

45:49.373 --> 45:53.681
and hesitated to kill him when
he saw that this person seemed

45:53.725 --> 45:56.162
to be having
a conversation with God.

45:56.206 --> 45:57.947
And it's frustrating for him.

45:57.990 --> 45:59.600
How could God speak to you?!

45:59.644 --> 46:03.735
My role is not the question,
I listen and serve,

46:03.779 --> 46:05.606
But we see,
at the end of the day,

46:05.650 --> 46:09.610
when he's up against this person
he doesn't trust them,

46:09.654 --> 46:13.005
he thinks that person's
faith is built on lies.

46:13.049 --> 46:15.921
And so, he takes him out for the
good of his group.

46:15.965 --> 46:17.923
No one is above saving.

46:18.794 --> 46:21.144

46:21.187 --> 46:23.233
I don't believe that.

46:23.668 --> 46:26.410
Aah.

46:26.453 --> 46:29.761
It is definitely hard to put
children in grave danger.

46:29.805 --> 46:32.285
We obviously have to be really
careful about, like,

46:32.329 --> 46:35.071
making sure that it's safe for
the kids.

46:35.114 --> 46:37.725
So, the tank is, like, very,
very controlled.

46:37.769 --> 46:39.815
That whole basement sits inside
a tank.

46:39.858 --> 46:42.861
There's like a steel cage,
basically, surrounding it,

46:42.905 --> 46:44.515
like, that fills with water.

46:44.558 --> 46:47.344
The water is heated so they're
not even cold, like,

46:47.387 --> 46:49.041
it's very, very balmy
and, like, being in,

46:49.085 --> 46:51.696
like, a warm bath, I think.

46:51.739 --> 46:54.481
And the, you know, obviously
story-wise I think we want to

46:54.525 --> 46:58.877
be mindful of not going, like,
too far with anything

46:58.921 --> 47:00.879
with kids,
but at the same time,

47:00.923 --> 47:03.055
Judith is a really strong
character.

47:03.099 --> 47:04.622
[Grunts]

47:04.665 --> 47:06.232
I think you can really tell
Judith is

47:06.276 --> 47:07.755
Rick and Michonne's daughter.

47:07.799 --> 47:10.889
Just in the way that she kinda
keeps her head

47:10.933 --> 47:13.283
in the middle of a pretty
intense situation.

47:13.326 --> 47:17.069
She has this calmness that
washes over her

exterior presentation so that
you can really see

47:20.072 --> 47:22.945
the leadership qualities that
both Rick and Michonne had,

47:22.988 --> 47:24.381
like coming out in her.

47:24.424 --> 47:26.209
She's really quite strong.

47:27.906 --> 47:31.388
Alden's death for Maggie is
actually very devastating.

For people who've been watching
the show for a long time,

47:33.912 --> 47:37.176
like, you can remember back to
when Maggie and Alden

47:37.220 --> 47:38.482
first kind of met.

47:38.525 --> 47:40.440
And Alden was a Savior.

47:40.484 --> 47:44.618
And he really was one of the
first Saviors to kind of say

47:44.662 --> 47:46.620
"I'm throwing in my lot with
you.

47:46.664 --> 47:48.448

what you're trying to do

build it."

And this character really was a
loyal friend to Maggie.

47:57.066 --> 47:58.981
So I think, like,
really the whole thing

47:59.024 --> 48:01.679
is pretty awful for her,
'cause I think she feels like

48:01.722 --> 48:03.724
I asked people to
come out on this mission

48:03.768 --> 48:06.814

here's the cost that was paid,

48:06.858 --> 48:08.294
the sacrifice.

48:08.338 --> 48:10.644
And I think also,
it's crushing to her to feel

48:10.688 --> 48:12.820
like he had a bad ending.

48:12.864 --> 48:16.737
He suffered as a Walker before
she came to get him again.

beginning of the season.

Obviously Negan's
form of leadership

was not always positive, but
Maggie has also been through

a lot and has had to make some
dark decisions of her own

they're seeing elements of their
own decision-making

in the other and it, like,
definitely for Maggie,

49:03.567 --> 49:07.223
that's a unsettling feeling
and an unsettling idea.

'Cause she wants nothing to do
with Negan.

And yet, you know,
she makes this decision

49:12.054 --> 49:14.143
in this episode to basically
kill them all.

she felt like she did

49:24.240 --> 49:25.676

And, yet,
it leaves her unsettled

49:27.243 --> 49:28.809
about the whole thing.

49:28.853 --> 49:33.031
And I think from Negan's side,
he's looking at a mirror

49:33.075 --> 49:36.948
of himself and going,
this is unsettling for me, too.

49:36.992 --> 49:40.560
I think he realizes the way that
he led, in some ways,

49:40.604 --> 49:44.303
caused a lot of unease and was
not the positive way of bringing

49:44.347 --> 49:47.002
people into his organization,
like he maybe thought it was.

49:47.045 --> 49:48.612

are doing

49:48.655 --> 49:50.701
a lot of soul searching
at this point.

49:52.094 --> 49:54.313
I'm going to be on my own way.

in that montage,

moment where Father Gabriel

they see this guy and he rolls
up and he's wearing this suit.

this slick hair

50:43.014 --> 50:44.755
and, like, a big smile.

they're not very trusting

in the suit.

that goes with it.

at the end of this episode

51:19.746 --> 51:22.836
to do, like, just a deep
flash forward.

awhile that Maggie was going to

become a trooper.
