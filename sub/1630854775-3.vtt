WEBVTT

01:19.213 --> 01:21.215
George.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.041
I'm a murderer.

01:27.141 --> 01:29.043
Look, Lou, I'm not
yanking your chain, okay.

01:29.143 --> 01:32.326
Matter of fact, I just closed
on a massive beef rub deal.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.649
I got a license deal
with McCormick.

01:34.749 --> 01:36.611
All we need is
a few John Hancocks,

01:36.711 --> 01:38.533
and the green
will start rolling in.

01:38.633 --> 01:39.694
Goddamn it, Taffy,

01:39.794 --> 01:41.416
do you know
who you borrowed from?

01:41.516 --> 01:42.737
These are Dallas people.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.179
They send someone down
to deal with you,

01:44.279 --> 01:46.061
they're gonna
deal with you!

01:46.161 --> 01:47.783
I got another call comin' in,
but hear me out.

01:47.883 --> 01:50.065
Just tell 'em everything's
gonna be okay.

01:50.165 --> 01:53.469
It's just, it's all
in escrow, man.

01:53.569 --> 01:55.030
Alright,
I'll talk to you. Bye.

01:55.130 --> 01:56.071
Whew.

01:56.171 --> 01:57.433
Taffy Boyle speakin'.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.874
(on phone) Oh, hi.
This is Michael Larson

01:58.974 --> 02:00.516
from Port Arthur Bank
and Trust,

02:00.616 --> 02:01.637
and I just wanted
to go over...

02:01.737 --> 02:03.279
Nope.

02:08.985 --> 02:11.367
♪ Got in a little trouble ♪

02:11.467 --> 02:13.409
♪ At the county seat ♪

02:13.509 --> 02:16.572

02:16.672 --> 02:18.494
Jamie, how's your ma doing?

02:18.594 --> 02:19.775
Oh, her back's
not so good.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.217
Aw, shucks, you know,
I'm gonna give her

02:21.317 --> 02:22.458
a shoutout
on the show tonight.

02:22.558 --> 02:24.661
That'd make
her week, Taff.

02:24.761 --> 02:26.302
Sheriff, you better
have a warrant

02:26.402 --> 02:28.144
the way you harassing
that meat right there.

02:28.244 --> 02:31.027
Brisket's so good,
ought to be illegal.

02:31.127 --> 02:32.949
Look here, everybody:

02:33.049 --> 02:35.152
Don't forget to floss.

02:35.252 --> 02:36.913
And remember
what we like to say,

02:37.013 --> 02:38.435
you know what
our slogan is:

02:38.535 --> 02:40.757
"We'll put the meat
in between your teeth,

02:40.857 --> 02:42.279
but you gonna get it out."

02:48.465 --> 02:49.727
Where have you been?

02:49.827 --> 02:51.689
Come on, Mandy.
Look, I'm not a teleporter.

02:51.789 --> 02:53.491
I got here
as soon as I can.

02:53.591 --> 02:55.693
You need to talk
to your brother.

02:55.793 --> 02:56.914
He's just been standing
in the meat locker

02:56.914 --> 02:58.336
like some kind of ghost.

02:58.436 --> 03:00.618
He's your husband.
You know how he gets.

03:00.718 --> 03:01.980
What's the problem now?
What, the new kid,

03:02.080 --> 03:03.742
he used hickory
instead of apple wood?

03:03.842 --> 03:05.904
This is different, Taffy.

03:06.004 --> 03:08.006
I've never seen him
like this.

03:12.851 --> 03:14.853
Hey, George.

03:17.977 --> 03:20.259
We have built
a temple of carnage.

03:22.341 --> 03:24.343
You bet your ass,
brother, we have.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.007
Oh, whoa, wait a minute.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.889
Uh, look,
look here, George,

03:29.989 --> 03:31.811
when we done
with this beef rub deal,

03:31.911 --> 03:32.972
okay, how about,

03:33.072 --> 03:34.734
how about you and Mandy
take a vacation,

03:34.834 --> 03:36.016
go to the Gulf
and celebrate.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.537
It'd be your
second honeymoon.

03:37.637 --> 03:39.099
Matter of fact, here,
I got the contract right here.

03:39.199 --> 03:40.420
We can get everything
done right--

03:40.520 --> 03:42.182
I don't need a vacation.

03:42.282 --> 03:44.284
I need out.

03:45.886 --> 03:47.107
You need
o-o-out of what?

03:47.207 --> 03:48.469
Out of all of it.

03:48.569 --> 03:50.070
The restaurant,
the beef rub deal,

03:50.170 --> 03:53.234
the self-perpetuating cycle
of endless cruelty.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.336
I'm going vegan, Taffy.

03:56.377 --> 03:58.379
Y-y-you're going vegan?

04:00.101 --> 04:01.442
I no longer want
to participate

04:01.542 --> 04:03.324
in the sale
of animal products.

04:03.424 --> 04:05.166
Okay, uh, George,

04:05.266 --> 04:06.728
you're a renowned pitmaster.

04:06.828 --> 04:08.970
Your whole dang life
has been animal products.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.332
Which is why
this is hard for me.

04:10.432 --> 04:12.494
I'd like to take my half
of the business

04:12.594 --> 04:15.697
and begin the next phase
of my journey.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.340
Come on, man,
you know I can't buy you out.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.501
I don't save like you.

04:19.601 --> 04:21.583
I already spoke
to JJ Ruskin in town,

04:21.683 --> 04:23.144
and he could take
a look at our books.

04:23.244 --> 04:24.586
He'll give us
a fair shake.

04:24.686 --> 04:27.629
What the fuck do JJ Ruskin
know about our books?

04:27.729 --> 04:29.271
Huh? Why the fuck
are you talking to--

04:29.371 --> 04:30.872
He don't know-- Look here,
let me tell you something,

04:30.972 --> 04:32.354
I do my books
a special way

04:32.454 --> 04:33.876
It's only a certain way
I can understand.

04:33.976 --> 04:35.477
JJ Ruskin not gonna understand
how to do my fucking--

04:35.577 --> 04:37.639
Hey, we're going
to figure this out.

04:37.739 --> 04:39.742
Alright? Don't worry.

04:40.262 --> 04:42.264
But this is happening.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.502
Mandy, I feel like...

04:59.602 --> 05:02.245
like everything's
closing in, you know?

05:03.487 --> 05:05.489
I don't know what to do.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.142
Okay...

05:56.262 --> 05:59.446
Now look here, y'all know
I love to run my mouth.

05:59.546 --> 06:01.968
But you have to know
that my brother George

06:02.068 --> 06:04.050
is the real genius.

06:04.150 --> 06:05.412
That's right.
He could take
a piece of meat

06:05.512 --> 06:08.535
and make it
into something divine.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.658
And you know what make George
so good at what he do?

06:11.758 --> 06:15.162
Is how much he cares
about the details.

06:21.849 --> 06:25.153
Now look, I thought
I'd come by one last time,

06:25.253 --> 06:27.355
to see if I can convince you
to change your mind.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.457
Hmm?

06:31.939 --> 06:32.920
You sure?

06:33.020 --> 06:35.022
I'm sure.

06:38.025 --> 06:40.728
How about we do this,
let's, let's--

06:40.828 --> 06:42.830
Why don't we just
sit here and enjoy...

06:43.871 --> 06:45.873
this beautiful sunset.

06:50.999 --> 06:53.021
Mm.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.123
Daddy's ax.

06:57.165 --> 06:58.387
Remember all those

06:58.487 --> 07:00.148
wood-splitting competitions
we would have?

07:00.248 --> 07:02.731
Mm-hmm.
I could not beat you once.

07:05.494 --> 07:08.737
I could not hold a candle
to my brother George.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.823
And Daddy damn sure
made sure I knew that too.

07:16.906 --> 07:18.288
Well, what good's
a mean brisket

07:18.388 --> 07:20.390
without butts
on the benches.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.173
You and Mandy
made this place,

07:23.273 --> 07:25.335
came up with
the radio show.

07:25.435 --> 07:27.417
Floss.
People love the floss.

07:27.517 --> 07:28.618
Yeah, they do love
that floss.

07:28.718 --> 07:31.101
You know,
people take it home and...

07:31.201 --> 07:32.623
use it with they own food.

07:37.007 --> 07:39.009
I'm really going
to miss you.

07:40.691 --> 07:42.693
I really am.

07:44.695 --> 07:46.777
You're going to be alright
without me.

07:49.941 --> 07:51.943
I know.

07:53.344 --> 07:55.727

Why don't we give it up
for my brother George.

And here you go, here's
a little something for you.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.413
Oh.

Enjoy that.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.061
Hey, there, come on,

08:48.161 --> 08:49.863
Belgrade, hmm?

08:49.963 --> 08:52.225
Pineland. Carthage. Nacogdoches.

08:52.325 --> 08:54.508
And any other straggler
that's tuning in.

08:54.608 --> 08:58.152
You know what it is?
It's your source
for everything barbecue.

08:58.252 --> 09:00.274
BBQ-and-A.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.958
And I'm your favourite host...

09:04.058 --> 09:06.240
...Taffy Boyle.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.443
But enough about me.
I want to hear from you.

09:08.543 --> 09:10.525
Caller, you're on the line.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.848
Got some happy customers
here, Taff.

09:13.948 --> 09:16.211
Say hi, everyone.

09:16.311 --> 09:18.413
Hi, everyone!

09:18.513 --> 09:20.215
Hello, everyone.
Back to you.

09:20.315 --> 09:23.378
Now, look, that voice sounded
really familiar to me.

09:23.478 --> 09:26.181
Is that who I think it is,
my sister-in-law Mandy Boyle?

09:26.281 --> 09:28.464
Hey, Mandy.
Won't you do me a favour?

09:28.564 --> 09:30.225
Kick off the show
with the first question.

09:30.325 --> 09:32.228
What you eatin' there, Luce?

09:32.328 --> 09:34.150
Best damn hot links
in the state.

09:34.250 --> 09:38.114
Ooh, best damn
hot links in the state.

09:38.214 --> 09:40.316
You know, so one
of my favourite things

09:40.416 --> 09:43.039
at Boyle Barbecue
is the hot links,

09:43.139 --> 09:44.520
and that's what this show
should be about.

09:44.620 --> 09:47.003
So I think tonight
we ought to talk about

09:47.103 --> 09:48.645
how the sausage gets made.

09:48.745 --> 09:50.827
And I mean it literally.

09:52.749 --> 09:55.732
Now, you guys know
I love to run my mouth,

09:55.832 --> 09:58.295
but you have to know
that my brother George

09:58.395 --> 10:00.097
is the real genius.

10:00.197 --> 10:01.458
That's right. He could
take a piece of meat

10:01.558 --> 10:04.221
and make it
into something divine.

10:04.321 --> 10:07.144
And you know what make George
so good at what he do?

10:07.244 --> 10:11.068
Is how much he cares
about the details.

10:11.168 --> 10:12.830
We used to buy
our hot links from a farm

10:12.930 --> 10:14.112
that shall go unnamed.

10:14.212 --> 10:15.833
But my brother George
had a problem

10:15.933 --> 10:17.155
with the texture
of the casing.

10:17.255 --> 10:19.197
He said to me, "Taffy,

10:19.297 --> 10:21.800
from now on, we're sourcing
our own intestines..."

10:37.796 --> 10:40.139
...the intestine casing,
they're thinking about

10:40.239 --> 10:42.341
the meat inside,
and that's a mistake.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.104
The intestine is like
a beautiful ship

10:45.204 --> 10:46.826
that brings the meat
on a journey...

12:17.621 --> 12:19.623
Shit.

12:38.963 --> 12:42.227
...real careful, real gentle,

12:42.327 --> 12:43.548
so they never see it comin'.

12:46.331 --> 12:47.632
Hey!
Where the fuck
you come from.

12:47.732 --> 12:50.856
Shoo!

12:55.220 --> 12:56.962
Shh. Shh.

13:01.706 --> 13:03.248
Get away from me.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.890
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

13:32.018 --> 13:33.840
I bet that's why
folks like yourselves

13:33.940 --> 13:36.363
keep comin' back
again and again.

13:36.463 --> 13:38.164
At Boyle's,
we do everything we can

13:38.264 --> 13:41.288
to make sure every last bite
is damn near perfection.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.810
And I want you all to know,
we're mighty grateful to you.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.093
Well, I hope that
answered your question

13:46.193 --> 13:48.535
but I've been goin' on about
hot links for long enough.

13:53.641 --> 13:54.862
Alright.

13:54.962 --> 13:56.984
I think it's about time
we take another call.

13:57.084 --> 13:59.086
How you feel about that?

14:05.213 --> 14:06.594
I-I-I think it's, uh...

14:06.694 --> 14:08.556
I think it's time that
we take another call, okay?

14:08.656 --> 14:10.238
How about that?

14:12.581 --> 14:14.643
Oh, here we go.
Taffy Boyle.

14:14.743 --> 14:18.086
Nobody should know
that much about sausages.

14:19.948 --> 14:22.531
Oh, come on.
Is that you again, Mandy?

14:22.631 --> 14:25.334
You gotta give somebody else
a opportunity to talk.

14:25.434 --> 14:26.455
Come on, now.

14:26.555 --> 14:27.817
Well, I just had
to call in

14:27.917 --> 14:30.419
and tell you what
a damn windbag you are.

14:33.242 --> 14:35.144
Oh, now I'm a windbag.

14:35.244 --> 14:36.666
I really love that, huh.

14:36.766 --> 14:38.107
Let me tell you something,

14:38.207 --> 14:39.909
let you know now,
if you thought that was a lot,

14:40.009 --> 14:42.672
we get plenty of more show
where that came from.

14:42.772 --> 14:44.474
So you better buckle up,
little lady.

14:44.574 --> 14:46.316
We're buckled up, Taffy.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.999
No more long rants
about sausages.

15:01.832 --> 15:03.775
Another great show, Taffy.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.256
It's all about
the details, my friend.

15:05.356 --> 15:06.858
All about the details.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.922
Uh, hey.

15:51.724 --> 15:54.467
Hi. How you doing? Hi.
Your dog is in my car.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.231
Uh, we don't have a dog.

15:58.331 --> 16:00.473
We're a gas station.

16:10.183 --> 16:12.185
Uh...

16:19.113 --> 16:21.055
Okay.
Go on. Disperse.

16:24.478 --> 16:25.660
Ow!

16:25.760 --> 16:27.762
Jesus.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.552
Out. Let's go.

16:37.652 --> 16:38.954
Out the car.

16:39.054 --> 16:42.437
This was a fun bit, but,
ow, it's time to go. Go!

16:42.537 --> 16:45.441
Oh geez, you're so strong.
What's wrong with you?

16:45.541 --> 16:48.644
Ow, geez.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.566
Oh wow, look at this.

16:50.666 --> 16:52.448
Yummy, yummy pork rinds.

16:52.548 --> 16:53.689
All doggies like that.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.871
Come on.
A little Hansel and Gretel.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.818
Okay. You know what?

17:01.918 --> 17:03.920
A little company might be nice.

17:18.695 --> 17:20.517
Ugh. Ugh.

17:20.617 --> 17:22.318
You know what, I'm having
some hard regrets

17:22.418 --> 17:23.720
re: my hospitality.

17:27.944 --> 17:29.686
Oh, Jesus.
Okay, you know what,

17:29.786 --> 17:31.168
how about some music.
Yeah?

17:31.268 --> 17:32.729
Tame the savage whatever.

17:35.352 --> 17:36.653
No?

17:43.601 --> 17:47.305
Radio host:
Did you know
85 percent of Mexicans

17:47.405 --> 17:49.026
have criminal records?

17:49.126 --> 17:51.269
They're erasing us folks. Bullshit.

17:51.369 --> 17:52.790
Radio host:
Us real Americans.

17:52.890 --> 17:54.432
Oh!

17:54.532 --> 17:56.955
Radio host:
Every day the wall
goes unfinished...

17:57.055 --> 17:58.917
This is what you want
to listen to.

17:59.017 --> 18:00.278
Radio host:
...and rapists arrive

18:00.378 --> 18:02.881
on our hallowed soil.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.324
MAGA dog. Perfect.

18:05.424 --> 18:08.407
Radio host:
...malfeasance on the part
of the government.

18:08.507 --> 18:11.010
Listen carefully, Patriots.

18:11.110 --> 18:12.811
The truth train's-a-comin'.

18:12.911 --> 18:16.095
And there she blows,
every hour
on the quarter here

18:16.195 --> 18:17.857
at the Deep State Dispatch.

18:20.359 --> 18:24.143
Oh my god, I'm snapping.
Okay? This is me snapping.

18:24.243 --> 18:26.186
I am snapping
right here.

18:26.286 --> 18:29.789
You racist, homophobic,
anti-Semitic, flatulent,

18:29.889 --> 18:32.032
just... bad dog.

18:32.132 --> 18:33.273
Bad dog!

18:33.373 --> 18:36.637
Yeah, I said it. Uh-huh.

18:36.737 --> 18:38.919
Oh, now you want to get out?

18:39.019 --> 18:40.280
Oh, okay.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.744
You bet your goose-stepping
fascist dog ass.

18:54.996 --> 18:58.600
Very good. Go build a wall,
you jackboot piece of shit.

19:00.842 --> 19:03.445
Oh!

19:04.286 --> 19:05.307
Oh fuck.

19:09.531 --> 19:11.553
Shit.

19:11.653 --> 19:14.476
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, you.
Is that your dog?

19:14.576 --> 19:15.918
Uh, no.

19:16.018 --> 19:17.800
Okay. I just saw you let it out.
What do you mean, no?

19:17.900 --> 19:20.843
That dog has ate
$300 worth of food,
and you're gonna pay for it.

19:20.943 --> 19:23.526
It was a couple of sausages.
Where did you get that math?

19:23.626 --> 19:26.169
Look here, we got a problem,
I'll go tell the sheriff.
He's right at table five.

19:26.269 --> 19:30.333
There is no need to jump
to extremes. I just, uh...

19:30.433 --> 19:34.697
I typically don't carry around
that kind of cash.

19:34.797 --> 19:37.179
How much would you say
a spare tire is worth?

19:37.279 --> 19:38.981
Hey, what's the problem here?

19:39.081 --> 19:41.624
The problem is, is that
her little mangy mutt

19:41.724 --> 19:43.025
has ate half a steer.

19:43.125 --> 19:46.109
Okay, look,
that dog is an asshole.

19:46.209 --> 19:49.753
There's no daylight
between us on that.
I just...

19:49.853 --> 19:54.518
Look, I'm kind of broke,
and I could really use a break.

19:54.618 --> 19:57.761
We could always use
a extra hand in the pit.

19:57.861 --> 20:00.884
George, okay, we're not hiring
some vagabond. Come on.

20:00.984 --> 20:02.086
What do you say? Huh?

20:02.186 --> 20:04.088
Work a shift,
we call it square.

20:04.188 --> 20:06.190
If you like it, you stay on.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.736
Barbecue means many things
around the world.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.898
But in Texas,
it means beef.

20:13.998 --> 20:15.820
And we like
to keep things simple.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.863
Meat, salt, pepper,

20:18.963 --> 20:22.147
and the fourth ingredient, wood.

20:22.247 --> 20:26.031
Now, our main smokers
use a blend of hickory,

20:26.131 --> 20:28.613
apple, mesquite,
and cherry.

20:30.615 --> 20:33.038
Hmm, which one is this?

20:36.742 --> 20:39.205
George, I got no idea.

20:39.305 --> 20:42.288
Good barbecue is like
a symphony,

20:42.388 --> 20:44.050
playing on all five senses,

20:44.150 --> 20:45.451
and a skilled conductor

20:45.551 --> 20:47.133
can pick out
each and every note.

20:47.233 --> 20:49.375
When in doubt,
try tasting it.

20:49.475 --> 20:51.618
Ha, ha. You're adorable.

20:53.479 --> 20:56.062
The reason brisket
needs eight hours

20:56.162 --> 20:57.544
is because of the stall.

20:57.644 --> 20:59.646
What's the stall?

21:00.567 --> 21:01.708
The first hour or two,

21:01.808 --> 21:03.350
the temperature is
steadily increasing

21:03.450 --> 21:05.472
until you reach about 160.

21:05.572 --> 21:06.714
Then you can get
stuck there

21:06.814 --> 21:09.396
for about four, five,
even six hours.

21:09.496 --> 21:13.401
See, the stall is where a...

21:13.501 --> 21:15.703
kind of alchemy takes place.

21:17.104 --> 21:18.126
You pull it at 210,

21:18.226 --> 21:20.648
let it rest for an hour,

21:20.748 --> 21:23.211
and always slice

21:23.311 --> 21:25.313
against the grain.

21:27.315 --> 21:29.938
Now, you see that look
on your face right there,

21:30.038 --> 21:32.040
that's what it's all about.

21:32.681 --> 21:34.683
Mm.

21:38.407 --> 21:41.349
So what's up with
all the floss?
It's everywhere.

21:41.449 --> 21:45.273
Taffy's big innovation
and our trademark quirk.

21:45.373 --> 21:47.375
I think it's great. Bullshit.

21:48.697 --> 21:50.599
Okay, I hate it.

21:50.699 --> 21:51.920
We do all this

21:52.020 --> 21:53.201
and we leave our customers

21:53.301 --> 21:55.204
with a putrid
chemical cinnamon.

21:55.304 --> 21:58.727
It's a... air horn
at the symphony.

21:58.827 --> 21:59.969
Huh.

22:00.069 --> 22:03.292
Meat poet.
Look at you.

22:03.392 --> 22:05.454
These animals give their lives,

22:05.554 --> 22:07.256
and I believe in honouring
their sacrifice

22:07.356 --> 22:09.699
by using
every last part of them.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.043
Are those, uh...

22:14.924 --> 22:16.066
dicks?

22:16.166 --> 22:18.268
Tongue.

22:18.368 --> 22:21.832
It is my absolute
favourite thing
that we make here.

22:21.932 --> 22:24.614
I use pecan
just for this.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.221
An unusual wood.

22:34.465 --> 22:37.328
Hey. That smells different.

22:37.428 --> 22:38.409
Mm-hmm.

22:38.509 --> 22:40.511
Huh.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.175
Does Mandy ever stay
up here with you?

22:44.275 --> 22:46.678
Hmm. She prefers
the house in town.

22:47.639 --> 22:48.620
Must get boring.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.582
Nah.

22:50.682 --> 22:52.684
Alone at night...

22:53.164 --> 22:55.167
I do my best thinking.

22:56.288 --> 22:59.431
You can hear what the universe
is trying to tell you.

22:59.531 --> 23:02.735
Yeah. Sounds boring.
You a movie guy?

23:03.896 --> 23:04.957
You like animals, right?

23:05.057 --> 23:07.159
So, let's see,
we got "Babe"...

23:07.259 --> 23:10.643
what else, "Charlotte's Web,"
and we got "Okja."

23:10.743 --> 23:12.285
Uh, I've only seen
the first half of that one,

23:12.385 --> 23:14.527
but it's pretty cute
so far.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.409
Uh, oh and there's...

24:02.757 --> 24:04.759
George?

24:06.320 --> 24:08.323
I'm a murderer.

24:18.013 --> 24:19.755
So I just said it.

24:19.855 --> 24:21.857
Taffy, I'm out.

24:22.217 --> 24:24.219
So I'm out.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.962
Wow.

24:27.062 --> 24:28.324
Good for you.

24:28.424 --> 24:30.286
You know,
it took guts to do that.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.568
And for what it's worth,
I don't think
you're a murderer.

24:32.668 --> 24:34.750
I think you're
a good person, George.

24:36.712 --> 24:38.715
You, uh...

24:39.155 --> 24:40.857
you live
on the road, right?

24:40.957 --> 24:44.361
Uh... yeah.
Yeah, I guess I do.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.705
So what's it like?

24:48.805 --> 24:52.870
To leave everything behind
and start fresh?

24:52.970 --> 24:56.553
Well, it's, uh...
it's easy.

24:56.653 --> 24:58.676
Too easy maybe.

24:58.776 --> 25:00.778
A life of fresh starts.

25:01.699 --> 25:03.441
But it suits me.

25:03.541 --> 25:06.204
And, yeah, and you get
to meet all sorts of people

25:06.304 --> 25:08.046
and all sorts of lives.

25:08.146 --> 25:09.807
All sorts of lies?
Lives.

25:09.907 --> 25:12.851
But, you know,
sometimes I just,

25:12.951 --> 25:15.854
I take a map,
I pick a spot,

25:15.954 --> 25:17.956
and I head there.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.499
So what are you
going to do?

25:20.599 --> 25:22.261
I have no idea.

25:22.361 --> 25:25.163
And that should scare me,
but it don't.

25:26.685 --> 25:29.168
One thing I do know--
Charlie!

25:30.970 --> 25:33.072
Where did you go?

25:33.172 --> 25:35.755
Oh, I guess
I kind of work here.

25:35.855 --> 25:37.076
Well, I should probably go.

25:37.176 --> 25:39.078
But, uh, what's
the one thing you know?

25:39.178 --> 25:41.260
Don't leave me hanging.
Charlie!

25:42.382 --> 25:43.803
Go on.
I'll tell you later.

25:43.903 --> 25:46.566
Eh, I'll hold you to that.

25:46.666 --> 25:49.689
Hope things
don't get too hectic
in the pit without me.

25:49.789 --> 25:52.652
Oh. Come on, I've had
three whole days of training,

25:52.752 --> 25:55.656
I'm practically a pro.

25:55.756 --> 25:57.938
Hot, hot, hot, holy hell.

25:58.038 --> 25:59.139
Hot, hot.

25:59.239 --> 26:01.741
Geez.
You know, we have fire gloves.

26:01.841 --> 26:03.263
What? Oh God, great.

26:03.363 --> 26:06.906
Okay, your timing is just
chef's kiss, Beto.

26:18.178 --> 26:19.960
Another great show, Taffy.

26:20.060 --> 26:21.642
It's all about
the details, my friend.

26:21.742 --> 26:23.043
All about the details.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.663
How'd it go?

26:41.763 --> 26:43.765
Fine.

26:49.051 --> 26:51.954
Beto, I can't find
the paprika.

26:52.054 --> 26:54.056
Can you go ask George
where it is?

26:56.579 --> 26:58.581
It's...

27:06.189 --> 27:07.891
Help!

27:11.154 --> 27:13.457
Help!

27:21.325 --> 27:24.188
Uh...

27:24.288 --> 27:26.951
you know, I know it's hard
to move forward

27:27.051 --> 27:28.312
from a tragedy like this,

27:28.412 --> 27:32.517
but, um, me and Mandy
discussed this and...

27:32.617 --> 27:34.399
we think
the best way to honour

27:34.499 --> 27:36.661
my brother George's
memory is, um...

27:38.182 --> 27:41.046
is by keeping
Boyle's Barbecue goin' strong.

27:41.146 --> 27:43.248
This place here
brings people together.

27:43.348 --> 27:46.211
Puts smiles on their faces,
meat in their bellies.

27:46.311 --> 27:48.313
And I know that's what
my brother George...

27:49.474 --> 27:51.777
I know that's what
he would have wanted.

27:51.877 --> 27:53.879
Bullshit.

27:58.724 --> 28:01.267
Uh, hey, uh...

28:01.367 --> 28:04.470
I think
I'm gonna hit the road.

28:04.570 --> 28:07.073
You gonna be alright
in the kitchen without me?

28:07.173 --> 28:09.235
It'll probably be easier.

28:09.335 --> 28:11.337
I appreciate the honesty.

28:13.739 --> 28:16.602
I, I know he was going
through some heavy stuff,

28:16.702 --> 28:19.245
but he seemed...

28:19.345 --> 28:22.328
I don't know, happy.

28:22.428 --> 28:23.449
I don't think
that's so unusual

28:23.549 --> 28:26.412
once people have
made up their minds.

28:26.512 --> 28:27.654
You think it could
have been an accident?

28:27.754 --> 28:30.857
Nah. Sheriff confirmed
it was a suicide.

28:30.957 --> 28:34.221
He shut all the windows.
He locked it from the inside.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.424
I had to force
the door open myself.

28:37.524 --> 28:39.526
George knew
what he was doing.

28:42.049 --> 28:44.051
Alright, well, uh...

28:45.092 --> 28:48.996
Hey, um, if you see
that fascist dog,

28:49.096 --> 28:51.338
tell him he's
a real asshole for me.

28:54.221 --> 28:56.224
Here.

28:58.586 --> 29:00.248
And again, very happy

29:00.348 --> 29:01.649
to be in business with you.

29:01.749 --> 29:04.212
But we could have waited
to finish the signing.

29:04.312 --> 29:06.615
We know you're
in mourning.

29:06.715 --> 29:09.217
Look-look here,
we appreciate
your condolences.

29:09.317 --> 29:11.260
But as you know,
more than anything,

29:11.360 --> 29:12.901
my brother George
cared about sharing

29:13.001 --> 29:16.065
his signature beef rub
with the world.

29:16.165 --> 29:18.828
Taffy and I just
really feel it's important

29:18.928 --> 29:20.509
to make his dreams
a reality.

29:20.609 --> 29:22.611
This last one
is just an initial.

29:27.577 --> 29:29.719
Welcome to the knitting circle

29:29.819 --> 29:31.481
with me, Cathy Jay.

29:31.581 --> 29:33.523
Today, I'll be
debating the merits

29:33.623 --> 29:35.966
of diamond
honeycomb stitch,

29:36.066 --> 29:37.407
with a very special guest,

29:37.507 --> 29:39.950
my dear friend Meryl Beauregard.

29:58.809 --> 30:00.932
You poor dumb little turd.

30:04.055 --> 30:05.917
Ow, asshole.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.566
He'll be fine
after a few days' rest.

30:14.666 --> 30:17.289
I mean, what kind
of a person runs a dog over

30:17.389 --> 30:19.091
and then just
leaves it there.

30:19.191 --> 30:20.412
Oh, he wasn't run over.

30:20.512 --> 30:22.654
Someone beat him
with a piece of wood.

30:22.754 --> 30:23.975
What's that now?

30:24.075 --> 30:26.217
Yeah, it was brutal.

30:26.317 --> 30:29.461
I extracted those
from his head wound.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.144
I'm also not certain
this dog is entirely dog.

30:32.244 --> 30:34.466
It could be
up to 25 percent jackal.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.950
Oh. Behaviourally,
that tracks.

30:38.050 --> 30:39.752
You can tell by the teeth.

30:39.852 --> 30:41.994
One was ripped out recently.

30:42.094 --> 30:43.996
That's what first drew
my attention to the...

30:44.096 --> 30:46.098
What the fuck
are you doing?

31:06.239 --> 31:08.142
I thought you
was leavin'.

31:08.242 --> 31:09.503
Oh, I am. Yeah.

31:09.603 --> 31:12.146
Just, uh, doing
a wood thing,

31:12.246 --> 31:13.828
'cause dog justice.

31:13.928 --> 31:15.469
You don't care.
I don't care.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.571
Uh...

32:34.932 --> 32:36.193
We are done.

32:36.293 --> 32:37.635
Dallas guys are paid.

32:37.735 --> 32:39.737
It is over.

32:40.418 --> 32:42.280
No more bridge loan shit.

32:42.380 --> 32:43.681
Yes, I'm in agreement.

32:43.781 --> 32:46.444
There is going to be
some changes around here.

32:46.544 --> 32:48.927
Okay. Change is good.
Change is healthy.

32:49.027 --> 32:52.210
From now on,
I'm handling the finances.

32:52.310 --> 32:56.234
Look, we done
what had to be done, right?

32:57.596 --> 33:00.238
Now we can move on
with our lives.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.883
Yeah. Mandy,
you thought of everything.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.713
We should get back
out there.

33:13.813 --> 33:15.815
Put on a good show.

33:23.623 --> 33:25.285
Yeah, I'm just trying
to figure out, like,

33:25.385 --> 33:26.446
where was he,
you know.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.888
When was the last time
you saw him?

33:27.988 --> 33:29.249
Hey, Charlie.

33:29.349 --> 33:31.451
Uh, what are you doing here?
Didn't you quit?

33:31.551 --> 33:32.613
Oh, yeah, I did.

33:32.713 --> 33:34.655
Uh, I'm just trying
to figure out...

33:34.755 --> 33:37.878
When was the last time
you saw that fascist
asshole dog?

33:39.720 --> 33:43.544
Okay. Um, how about
we talk in my office?

33:43.644 --> 33:45.746
Alright. What are you
doing here, Charlie?

33:45.846 --> 33:49.410
Oh, you know, I, I, I think
there's been a murder.

33:51.092 --> 33:52.233
Murder?

33:52.333 --> 33:54.235
Well,
you know, not a murder

33:54.335 --> 33:56.438
but an attempted murder,
so I...

33:56.538 --> 34:00.222
I think someone tried to kill
that little shithead dog.

34:00.902 --> 34:02.904
A dog?

34:04.066 --> 34:06.008
You do know my brother
just died, right?

34:06.108 --> 34:07.970
Oh no, I know.
And I'm very sorry.

34:08.070 --> 34:09.411
Uh, I-I'm just,

34:09.511 --> 34:11.654
I'm trying to figure out
what happened.

34:11.754 --> 34:14.657
So someone beat it
with a log

34:14.757 --> 34:16.018
over by
your brother's trailer,

34:16.118 --> 34:17.420
which, I mean,
I get it.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.981
That thing can be
a real dick.

34:19.081 --> 34:21.304
But then they moved it.

34:21.404 --> 34:23.026
I mean,
that's weird, right?

34:23.126 --> 34:24.347
What do you mean
they moved it?

34:24.447 --> 34:26.189
Well, because of
the pecan.

34:26.289 --> 34:27.590
The pee-what?

34:27.690 --> 34:28.872
The pecan wood?

34:28.972 --> 34:31.575
Eh, I could hear
when I tasted...

34:33.336 --> 34:34.998
there were traces

34:35.098 --> 34:38.122
of pecan wood
in the dog wounds.

34:38.222 --> 34:39.323
And that means

34:39.423 --> 34:41.445
the murder weapon
came from--

34:41.545 --> 34:44.327
Okay. When did you
become CSI?

34:44.427 --> 34:47.010
Look, it's just
a dead dog in Texas.
That's it.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.012
Well, mm...

34:49.112 --> 34:51.575
I mean,
it's not just though.

34:51.675 --> 34:55.499
You've got two kind of
mysterious incidents

34:55.599 --> 34:57.941
in very close proximity
to each other.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.684
My brother's death
is not mysterious.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.748
It's tragic.

35:03.848 --> 35:05.549
Well...

35:05.649 --> 35:10.274
yeah, but now that
we're talking it through, uh...

35:10.374 --> 35:13.197
I think maybe the dog
saw something

35:13.297 --> 35:14.919
related to your
brother's death.

35:15.019 --> 35:17.622
Like what?
Like, I don't know.

35:18.583 --> 35:19.604
Malfeasance.

35:19.704 --> 35:20.846
Malfeasance?

35:20.946 --> 35:22.687
Something that someone

35:22.787 --> 35:24.049
didn't want it to see,

35:24.149 --> 35:27.332
and they felt that the dog
had to be silenced.

35:27.432 --> 35:30.976
I mean, you do know
dogs can't talk, right?

35:31.076 --> 35:32.738
Well, nobody's saying
dogs can talk.

35:32.838 --> 35:34.840
So what are you saying,
Charlie?

35:36.962 --> 35:38.965
Well...

35:40.166 --> 35:42.148
he said
he'd tell me later.

35:42.248 --> 35:43.910
The last time George
and I talked,

35:44.010 --> 35:46.753
he said he'd tell me
something later.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.635
And he believed it.

35:48.735 --> 35:52.038
And that means, you know,
he thought he'd be alive

35:52.138 --> 35:54.321
at the end of the night.

35:54.421 --> 35:56.403
Look...

35:56.503 --> 35:59.286
we're all taking this
really hard, Charlie.

35:59.386 --> 36:03.210
Do you know I would give
all of this up...

36:03.310 --> 36:04.532
to have my brother back.

36:04.632 --> 36:06.634
Bullshit.

36:08.956 --> 36:10.958
Sorry.

36:17.045 --> 36:19.047
You know what I think?

36:20.168 --> 36:22.170
I think...

36:23.291 --> 36:25.994
you need to get
the fuck out of town

36:26.094 --> 36:28.457
and don't show your face
around here again.

36:29.658 --> 36:31.320
Because in Texas,

36:31.420 --> 36:33.322
no matter if you're
canine or other,

36:33.422 --> 36:36.465
we do not smile kindly
on trespassers.

36:38.187 --> 36:40.710
Is that purely decorative?

36:43.192 --> 36:45.194
Not entirely, no.

36:46.956 --> 36:48.958
Shit.

36:55.804 --> 36:57.947
Well, yeah, I know,
but he basically said

36:58.047 --> 37:00.049
he'd shoot me
if I go back there.

37:02.892 --> 37:06.316
Look, you might be right,
but we don't have any proof.

37:06.416 --> 37:09.078
I don't know,
I just say we move on,

37:09.178 --> 37:11.921
fresh start, you know,
put all this behind us.

37:13.943 --> 37:16.767
Avenge you?
I don't even like you.

37:28.319 --> 37:30.261
Fine. Listen,
you got to stay here.

37:30.361 --> 37:32.984
Remember,
you're a wanted bitch.

37:34.325 --> 37:36.027
Just... alright,
I'll put on the sicko.

37:36.127 --> 37:37.909
Radio host:
I don't know about you,

37:38.009 --> 37:39.390
but what I do
in the bathroom

37:39.490 --> 37:41.272
definitely ain't
"gender neutral."

37:41.372 --> 37:43.374
Ugh.

37:43.855 --> 37:45.857
Just don't bark.

38:40.074 --> 38:41.856
I'm so sorry, Taffy.

38:41.956 --> 38:43.738
♪ I'd rather
break my heart in two ♪

38:43.838 --> 38:45.340
Thank you.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.024
♪ Than have you spread
the word around ♪

38:49.124 --> 38:52.487
♪ Every time you put me down ♪

39:29.485 --> 39:32.408
An air horn
at the symphony.

39:34.851 --> 39:36.853
Hmm.

40:30.109 --> 40:32.832
The heck are you doin'?

40:39.359 --> 40:42.062
Now, you might say
that's impossible.

40:42.162 --> 40:43.623
The door was locked
from the inside,

40:43.723 --> 40:45.705
but that's where
the cinnamon floss

40:45.805 --> 40:46.947
comes into play.

40:47.047 --> 40:49.369
Right? Cinnamon floss?

40:50.570 --> 40:51.872
I guess I'm not
over the part

40:51.972 --> 40:53.354
where you're
a human lie detector.

40:53.454 --> 40:55.996
Yeah, I know.
It's, uh, it's crazy, but--

40:56.096 --> 40:58.098
My favourite colour
is yellow.

40:58.899 --> 40:59.960
Bullshit.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.283
I grew up in Old Dime Box. Bullshit.

41:02.383 --> 41:04.385
I grew up in Tanglewood.

41:07.268 --> 41:09.050
Wow.

41:09.150 --> 41:11.413
You ever gamble?
'Cause you could
make a killing?

41:13.714 --> 41:15.716
Nah.

41:16.877 --> 41:18.879
I loved my husband.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.762
How about that one?

41:25.326 --> 41:27.328
Out of my purview.

41:28.610 --> 41:31.913
I loved how much
he loved what he did.

41:32.013 --> 41:34.836
And then one day he wakes up
and decides he hates the thing

41:34.936 --> 41:36.478
that he devoted
his life to.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.580
He thinks it's murder.

41:41.343 --> 41:43.605
I can only imagine that.

41:43.705 --> 41:46.148
I still don't believe
he wanted to die.

41:48.671 --> 41:50.653
Malfeasance, you said.

41:50.753 --> 41:52.495
Yeah.

41:52.595 --> 41:54.597
I think so.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.743
Well, I mean,
Taffy's got a solid alibi.

42:00.843 --> 42:02.846
We all heard him
on the radio.

42:09.733 --> 42:11.355
Radio host:
...these Chinese sonar attacks

42:11.455 --> 42:14.718
have caused a 30 percent
increase in homosexuality

42:14.818 --> 42:16.200
amongst our teens.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.322
Their beams are able
to traverse vast differences...

42:18.422 --> 42:20.564
Oh, my God, bullshit.
...and unlock the hormones

42:20.664 --> 42:22.666
associated with
unholy desires!

42:24.028 --> 42:25.409
And I'm going to tell you

42:25.509 --> 42:27.532
how to protect yourself
from these sonar attacks.

42:27.632 --> 42:29.894
But, uh, up first,
one of my favourite records,

42:29.994 --> 42:32.817
"Filles de Kilimanjaro"
by Miles Davis.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.018
Enjoy.

42:36.881 --> 42:38.623
Hey, uh,
how can I help you?

42:38.723 --> 42:41.386
Hanky T. Pickens.

42:41.486 --> 42:44.229
Wait, all this,
it's all a gag?

42:44.329 --> 42:47.232
I knew you
didn't really believe
any of this crap.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.874
Yeah. Well,
I also hate jazz,

42:48.974 --> 42:50.916
but, uh, that doesn't
stop me from doing

42:51.016 --> 42:54.520
Midnight Cool with Dr. James.

42:54.620 --> 42:57.723
Oh, my God.
The doctor is in...

42:57.823 --> 43:00.406
...the groove.

43:00.506 --> 43:02.048
Yeah.

43:02.148 --> 43:03.209
Wow.

43:03.309 --> 43:05.492
Yeah, I, I have logged
a lot of miles

43:05.592 --> 43:06.693
listening to you, man.

43:06.793 --> 43:07.814
You're blowing my mind
right now.

43:07.914 --> 43:08.855
What else do you do?

43:08.955 --> 43:09.896
The Morning Buzz

43:09.996 --> 43:11.258
with Jimmy the Jerk.

43:11.358 --> 43:12.939
No.
The Knitting Circle

43:13.039 --> 43:14.501
with Cathy Jay.

43:14.601 --> 43:16.023
Fucking Cathy.

43:16.123 --> 43:18.505
<i>Y la Poderosa Super</i>

43:18.605 --> 43:20.788
<i>con DJ Sanchez.</i>

43:20.888 --> 43:23.950
Oh, I, I'm not sure that
one's cool to do anymore.

43:24.050 --> 43:25.552
Yeah. You know, I was
a theatre major in school,

43:25.652 --> 43:28.515
and there's a lot of hours
to fill in here.

43:28.615 --> 43:31.358
Uh, you work at,
at Boyle's, right?

43:31.458 --> 43:32.559
Yeah. How do you
know that?

43:32.659 --> 43:34.661
You kind of smell
like a fireplace.

43:35.182 --> 43:37.404
But not in a bad way.

43:37.504 --> 43:41.328
Yeah, I guess I came here
to scope out,

43:41.428 --> 43:42.970
poke around something.

43:43.070 --> 43:44.812
I don't know what I
actually thought I'd find.

43:44.912 --> 43:48.055
Uh, were you here
for last night's BBQ-and-A?

43:48.155 --> 43:51.359
Sure, sure. Uh,
Taffy brings me brisket.

43:53.681 --> 43:56.544
Uh, did he... leave

43:56.644 --> 43:58.306
at any point
during the show?

43:58.406 --> 44:00.789
No. I was sitting
right out there
the whole time,

44:00.889 --> 44:02.891
and he never came out.

44:03.331 --> 44:05.333
Can I ask you
a weird favour?

44:14.623 --> 44:16.165
When were you gonna
tell me you beat a dog

44:16.265 --> 44:18.568
within an inch
of its life?

44:18.668 --> 44:20.670
Um...

44:21.951 --> 44:23.693
I wasn't.

44:23.793 --> 44:28.218
Well, now we've got
a big problem.

44:28.318 --> 44:30.700
Here you go.
Whole BBQ hour
from last night.

44:30.800 --> 44:33.543
Wow. Thanks for your help.

44:33.643 --> 44:34.705
Literally any time.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.847
I cannot overstate
how bored I am.

44:41.572 --> 44:43.754
Uh, I think I know
how he did it.

44:43.854 --> 44:46.717
Oh, Charlie.
You scared me.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.879
I've been listening
to last night's show,

44:48.979 --> 44:52.363
and there's this
16-minute stretch

44:52.463 --> 44:53.564
with no live calls,

44:53.664 --> 44:56.768
where Taffy's just going on
about sausage.

44:56.868 --> 44:58.650
So if he had
prerecorded that,

44:58.750 --> 45:02.334
well, he could have snuck out
and killed George then.

45:02.434 --> 45:05.897
Wow, that's, I mean,
that's crazy.

45:05.997 --> 45:07.379
But would that
have been enough time?

45:07.479 --> 45:10.162
Well, actually, yes.
I, I tested it.

45:13.365 --> 45:15.908
Gah! Fuck you, Dog.

45:18.490 --> 45:20.593
Dog.

45:25.698 --> 45:27.440
The one piece
I can't figure out is that

45:27.540 --> 45:28.922
in order to have
prerecorded that,

45:29.022 --> 45:30.603
he would have had to know
that he was going to get

45:30.703 --> 45:32.705
a question about hot links.

45:33.786 --> 45:35.848
He did.
Oh, he did?

45:35.948 --> 45:37.329
He asked me to cue him.

45:37.429 --> 45:38.851
It's something
we've done before

45:38.951 --> 45:40.733
when we're trying to move
a particular cut of meat.

45:40.833 --> 45:43.096
Like you just go up
to someone who's eating it?

45:43.196 --> 45:44.257
Yeah.

45:44.357 --> 45:46.819
Wow. So, I mean, this is,

45:46.919 --> 45:48.781
this is some
serious shit, Charlie.

45:48.881 --> 45:51.785
I mean, this is
a murder accusation.

45:51.885 --> 45:53.907
Can you prove it?
Prove it?

45:54.007 --> 45:55.989
What, like cop prove it,
prove it?

45:56.089 --> 45:57.671
No, very much not.

45:57.771 --> 45:59.953
But goddamn, I swear,
there's a piece missing.

46:00.053 --> 46:02.676
You know, something
that would tie
the whole room together.

46:02.776 --> 46:04.678
It's, it's, it's right
on the edge of my brain

46:04.778 --> 46:06.600
just driving me nuts.

46:06.700 --> 46:08.722
Well, if you do
find real proof,

46:08.822 --> 46:10.685
you come to me first, okay?

46:10.785 --> 46:11.966
I'm, I'm tight
with the sheriff,

46:12.066 --> 46:14.408
and we can go
to him together.

46:16.070 --> 46:18.072
Good night, Charlie.

46:19.314 --> 46:21.316
Paprika.

46:25.320 --> 46:26.862
Paprika?

46:26.962 --> 46:30.145
Yeah, just this
stupid little thing
that's been bugging me.

46:30.245 --> 46:32.828
'Cause mostly
when people lie,

46:32.928 --> 46:34.750
it's for some dumb
"who cares" reason,

46:34.850 --> 46:36.271
which I'm sure this is.

46:36.371 --> 46:37.993
So last night
in the kitchen,

46:38.093 --> 46:40.996
you said you didn't know
where the paprika was,

46:41.096 --> 46:42.678
but y-you did know.

46:42.778 --> 46:46.262
So why were you lying
about the paprika?

46:51.347 --> 46:52.689
It was hectic.

46:52.789 --> 46:53.890
There was a lot going on,

46:53.990 --> 46:56.833
and I wanted Beto
to find it.

46:58.315 --> 46:59.576
To find it?

47:03.280 --> 47:05.282
Right.

47:06.003 --> 47:09.066
Look, Charlie,
I like you.

47:09.166 --> 47:12.990
And if Taffy really is
who you say he is, then...

47:13.090 --> 47:16.234
well, he must be
very dangerous.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.796
For your own safety,
I think your best move is

47:18.896 --> 47:22.760
to hit the road,
get a fresh start.

47:33.792 --> 47:35.614
God, I told you
to be quiet.

47:37.676 --> 47:39.338
I'm trying to think.

48:07.226 --> 48:10.329
Hey.

48:10.429 --> 48:13.533
Hey. Didn't I tell you
not to show your face
around here again?

48:13.633 --> 48:15.935
I know what you did,
you shit-kicking psycho.

48:16.035 --> 48:17.777
Why don't you do me
a favour and just get out?

48:17.877 --> 48:19.499
Nope. 'Cause I got proof.

48:19.599 --> 48:20.941
Cop proof.

48:21.041 --> 48:24.224
Something you missed,
and it's going to put you away.

48:24.324 --> 48:25.505
Oh really?
Well, at first,

48:25.605 --> 48:27.548
it was a lot
of little things.

48:27.648 --> 48:30.871
Dog tooth in the ashes,
cinnamon floss,
George's beer.

48:30.971 --> 48:33.033
You know, I sniffed the bottle,
and it didn't smell
like anything.

48:33.133 --> 48:35.916
And I thought,
what are you doing, Charlie?
You're not a poison sniffer.

48:36.016 --> 48:38.559
And anyway, you wouldn't use
a poison that would show up

48:38.659 --> 48:39.680
in an autopsy.

48:39.780 --> 48:42.283
You'd use Ambien
or something.

48:42.383 --> 48:44.566
But what does Ambien
even smell like?

48:44.666 --> 48:45.967
But what's weird was

48:46.067 --> 48:48.570
it really didn't smell
like anything.

48:48.670 --> 48:49.851
I mean, not even beer.

48:49.951 --> 48:52.734
You see, someone had
washed out the bottle.

48:52.834 --> 48:55.457
I mean, who washes out
a bottle of beer?

48:55.557 --> 48:58.460
So you think
George was killed

48:58.560 --> 49:00.382
because somebody
rinsed out a beer bottle?

49:00.482 --> 49:02.625
Well, then there was
your radio show.

49:02.725 --> 49:04.867
I listened to it
over and over,

49:04.967 --> 49:06.749
like I was Gene Hackman
or something.

49:06.849 --> 49:09.352
Gene Hackman?
I was looking for a sound.

49:09.452 --> 49:11.033
Uh, something
that would prove

49:11.133 --> 49:13.196
that you recorded it
ahead of time.

49:13.296 --> 49:14.717
And I found nothing.

49:14.817 --> 49:15.959
Of course, you didn't.

49:16.059 --> 49:18.481
But then I realised
it wasn't a sound.

49:18.581 --> 49:21.044
It was the absence
of a sound.

49:21.144 --> 49:23.807
Sort of like the beer
but for the ears.

49:23.907 --> 49:26.810
The truth train.
You know, it goes by
every hour on the quarter.

49:26.910 --> 49:29.052
I-- You can hear it
in all the other shows.

49:29.152 --> 49:30.414
You should have been
able to hear it

49:30.514 --> 49:31.735
in last night's BBQ-and-A,

49:31.835 --> 49:34.218
but it's not there.

49:34.318 --> 49:36.800
Oh.

49:55.579 --> 49:57.581
So, let me get
this straight.

49:58.823 --> 50:02.687
You think that I could be
charged for murder

50:02.787 --> 50:07.311
because you didn't hear
the sound of a... a train.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.778
Probably not.

50:13.878 --> 50:16.341
But that's when I found
the real proof.

50:16.441 --> 50:18.984
The thing that's gonna
put your ass away.

50:19.084 --> 50:21.947
Well, I'm going
to explain it to you

50:22.047 --> 50:24.109
in great detail
right now.

50:24.209 --> 50:26.932
You see...

50:37.944 --> 50:39.445
Hello?
We're fucked.

50:39.545 --> 50:42.409
She's got us
dead to rights.

50:42.509 --> 50:44.811
Taffy? What are you
talking about?

50:44.911 --> 50:46.973
That nasty little blonde.

50:47.073 --> 50:48.335
She can prove
we killed George.

50:48.435 --> 50:49.656
Wha--?

50:49.756 --> 50:52.259
Okay, calm down, Taffy.
Tell me what happened.

50:52.359 --> 50:53.660
I'm going
to call the sheriff.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.823
Tell him everything.
Maybe he'll cut us a deal.

50:55.923 --> 50:57.785
Taffy, do not.

50:57.885 --> 51:00.067
That is the last thing
we should do.

51:00.167 --> 51:01.308
I'm scared, baby.

51:01.408 --> 51:04.011
I'm so scared.
I can't go to prison.

51:06.053 --> 51:08.356
Well, maybe if you'd
stuck to my plan

51:08.456 --> 51:09.998
and hadn't attacked
that fuckin' dog,

51:10.098 --> 51:12.100
she wouldn't be on to us.

51:15.063 --> 51:17.065
Don't do anything.

51:17.826 --> 51:19.828
I'll be there
in 10 minutes.

51:22.350 --> 51:25.214
See you soon, sweetheart.

51:25.314 --> 51:26.695
Which seems inconsequential

51:26.795 --> 51:28.257
until you consider
the atmospherics.

51:28.357 --> 51:30.379
The high yesterday
was 72 degrees.

51:30.479 --> 51:32.141
84 percent.

51:32.241 --> 51:34.984
Four miles per hour
from the east.

51:35.084 --> 51:37.747
Not an unusual
set of conditions

51:37.847 --> 51:39.148
in and of themselves,

51:39.248 --> 51:41.190
but nothing exists
in a vacuum.

51:41.290 --> 51:45.435
Do you know
the smoke point of hickory?

51:45.535 --> 51:47.877
No.
570 degrees.

51:47.977 --> 51:50.160
That's 570 degrees.

51:50.260 --> 51:51.962
I'm going
to let you ponder

51:52.062 --> 51:53.443
the implications
of that for a moment.

51:53.543 --> 51:56.166
Charlie, what the fuck
are you talking about?

51:56.266 --> 51:58.409
Look, look, I've been
hearing your bullshit

51:58.509 --> 52:00.331
this whole time
for 20 minutes straight,

52:00.431 --> 52:02.213
and it doesn't make
any fuckin' sense.

52:02.313 --> 52:05.175
Now, for Pete's sake,
could you do me a favour

52:05.275 --> 52:08.478
and just let me know what
this undeniable evidence is?

52:10.640 --> 52:11.581
It doesn't matter.

52:11.681 --> 52:13.543
What?
Eh, doesn't matter.

52:13.643 --> 52:15.786
Because I just got
a confession, so.

52:15.886 --> 52:17.588
I haven't confessed
to anything.

52:17.688 --> 52:19.590
Oh, no, not yours.

52:19.690 --> 52:22.553
What the hell
is all this, huh?

52:22.653 --> 52:24.115
It's what your brother
taught me.

52:24.215 --> 52:26.837
The most important part
of the cook...

52:26.937 --> 52:28.940
it's the stall.

52:31.743 --> 52:33.645
What?

52:33.745 --> 52:35.246
There he is!

52:35.346 --> 52:37.669
There's my husband's killer.

52:42.754 --> 52:44.736
Which will conclusively prove

52:44.836 --> 52:46.058
George Soros' role

52:46.158 --> 52:48.420
in orchestrating
the plandemic.

52:48.520 --> 52:50.622
But first,
Dear Patriots,

52:50.722 --> 52:53.265
the truth train has
brought us a conspiracy

52:53.365 --> 52:55.027
in our own backyard.

52:55.127 --> 52:57.350
Now, you may think
you know the story,

52:57.450 --> 52:59.632
brotherly bloodshed
at Boyle's Barbecue

52:59.732 --> 53:02.515
where the side
of the day is fratricide.

53:02.615 --> 53:04.637
But it turns out
there's one more layer

53:04.737 --> 53:07.841
of this bloomin' onion
left to peel back.

53:07.941 --> 53:10.924
Now, feast your ears
on this.

53:11.024 --> 53:13.406
I'm scared, baby.
I'm so scared.

53:13.506 --> 53:14.768
I can't go to prison.

53:14.868 --> 53:17.251
Well, maybe
if you'd stuck to my plan

53:17.351 --> 53:18.812
and hadn't attacked
that fuckin' dog,

53:18.912 --> 53:20.914
she wouldn't be on to us.

53:21.955 --> 53:23.617
Shit.

53:23.717 --> 53:26.140
Now, it's like
I always say,

53:26.240 --> 53:29.063
there's a whole lot
of bullshit out there.

53:29.163 --> 53:31.305
So I'd like to give
a special shoutout

53:31.405 --> 53:32.787
to the truth tellers.

53:32.887 --> 53:37.672
Those real-life heroes
that can sniff it on out.

53:37.772 --> 53:40.635
See, they're our only hope
against Soros,

53:40.735 --> 53:43.038
Pelosi, the Zionists,

53:43.138 --> 53:45.961
