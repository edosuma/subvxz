DALE:
Eh? Eh?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.525
Ooh!
Balloon!

00:36.029 --> 00:37.496
Whose birthday
is it?

00:37.530 --> 00:39.157
Joseph's?
Or Nancy's?

00:39.198 --> 00:40.165
No, wait!

00:40.199 --> 00:41.598
It's my birthday,
isn't it?

00:41.634 --> 00:43.101
Bill, it's
a weather balloon.

00:43.136 --> 00:44.364
And your birthday's...

00:44.404 --> 00:47.305
uh, was last week.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.570
Uh, sorry, Bill.

00:49.609 --> 00:51.304
Happy belated birthday.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.402
Thank you, Hank.

00:52.445 --> 00:54.208
I've got
18 more of these.

00:54.247 --> 00:55.544
A balloonist’s dozen.

00:55.581 --> 00:58.414
Hey, man, how about
that dang old dude,
man, true story man,

00:58.451 --> 01:00.885
it got, got him,
all them balloons
up in 'em lawn chair,

01:00.920 --> 01:03.514
man, going around 16,000 feet,
man, that old Bruce Dern

01:03.556 --> 01:05.524
played him in a,
in a dang old movie, man.

01:05.558 --> 01:07.992
Boomhauer, that guy
almost died.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.325
You can't just strap
some weather balloons

01:10.363 --> 01:13.332
to a lawn chair and fly
to the store for some candy.

01:13.366 --> 01:15.197
That's ridiculous.

01:15.234 --> 01:16.428
(sighs)

01:16.469 --> 01:17.527
I need to focus.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.299
Our biggest propane sale
of the year starts tomorrow.

01:19.339 --> 01:23.799
I can't afford
to be thinking about helium.

01:23.843 --> 01:28.780
Yeah, that's ridiculous,
Boomhauer.

01:32.685 --> 01:33.674
This is it.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.711
The Grillstravaganza.

01:35.755 --> 01:37.484
Okay, let's do it.

01:37.523 --> 01:38.615
On three.

01:38.658 --> 01:40.523
One, two, three.

01:40.560 --> 01:46.055
For the customer!

01:46.099 --> 01:47.464
Enrique!
Nice clip-on.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.467
Looking good.

01:48.501 --> 01:50.469
Donna, thanks
for clearing your desk.

01:50.503 --> 01:53.267
I know how much
you like your unicorns.

01:53.306 --> 01:55.240
(sighs)

01:55.274 --> 01:57.208
Joe Jack,
what's with the hat?

01:57.243 --> 01:58.210
Sorry, honey.

01:58.244 --> 01:59.802
But this year,
I'm going to

01:59.846 --> 02:01.837
be selling
more grills
than you.

02:01.881 --> 02:05.214
In fact, your winning streak's
about to go up in flames.

02:05.251 --> 02:06.218
Abra-kazam!

02:06.252 --> 02:10.449
Ah, good God, that's hot.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.685
Do you know why
I sell the most propane

02:12.725 --> 02:15.057
every Grillstravaganza,
Joe Jack?

02:15.094 --> 02:16.561
I educate the customer

02:16.596 --> 02:18.826
so they can make
an informed decision.

02:18.865 --> 02:20.264
That's my magic trick.

02:20.299 --> 02:22.790
Oh-oh.

02:22.835 --> 02:24.803
Rabbit done peed on my head.

02:27.974 --> 02:29.066
Boy, that Joe Jack.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.804
He's never going to get
anywhere until he learns

02:31.844 --> 02:34.005
that sales
is all about character.

02:34.046 --> 02:36.947
Well, unfortunately,
that is the sort of lesson

02:36.983 --> 02:39.281
he will only learn
on his deathbed.

02:39.318 --> 02:41.582
And no one wants
to buy a grill from a dying man.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.646
Hey, you know
who might get a kick

02:43.689 --> 02:45.384
out of learning
some character?

02:45.425 --> 02:46.255
Bobby.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.816
Maybe I'll take him to work.

02:47.860 --> 02:51.125
Show him how his old man
pays for his bath salts.

02:59.705 --> 03:00.763
Cookies!

03:00.807 --> 03:02.866
Bobby, that's not a cookie.

03:02.909 --> 03:04.376
It's a sales cookie.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.378
When you make a sale,
you get a cookie,

03:06.412 --> 03:07.379
and you get to ring the bell.

03:07.413 --> 03:10.382
It's asinine,
but it works
for some people.

03:10.416 --> 03:11.383
(rings bell)

03:11.417 --> 03:14.215
The sales cookie's the sweetest
cookie you'll ever taste, honey.

03:14.253 --> 03:18.986
Every time I hear a bell,
I starts to drooling.

03:19.025 --> 03:20.993
And this is the sales board.

03:21.027 --> 03:23.723
It's like the giant scoreboard
at the Masters.

03:23.763 --> 03:26.596
Except instead of Tiger Woods,
you have me.

03:26.632 --> 03:27.599
Wow.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.533
Cookies,
my name in blue marker...

03:29.569 --> 03:32.800
What do you want me
to sell first?

03:32.839 --> 03:33.806
(laughs)

03:33.840 --> 03:36.741
You want to make a sale
on your first day?

03:36.776 --> 03:38.073
(laughs)

03:38.110 --> 03:39.873
Ah, God bless you, boy.

03:39.912 --> 03:45.873
Uh, I think you better
watch this first.

03:45.918 --> 03:46.907
Morning, sir.

03:46.953 --> 03:49.251
I see you admiring
the Vogner line.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.552
Why don't you give these
brochures a read,

03:51.591 --> 03:52.888
talk them over
with your wife,

03:52.925 --> 03:54.893
or a trusted
older family member,

03:54.927 --> 03:57.327
and come back
if and when you're ready.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.558
We'll be here.

03:59.599 --> 04:00.497
Okay.

04:00.533 --> 04:03.127
Well, thanks.

04:03.169 --> 04:04.193
Yes!

04:04.237 --> 04:06.671
Gives me chills every time.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.071
I don't get it.

04:08.107 --> 04:09.404
You let him leave.

04:09.442 --> 04:11.239
At the end of the month,
you'll get it,

04:11.277 --> 04:15.611
when my customers return,
educated and ready to buy.

04:15.648 --> 04:17.582
That leads us
to lesson number one.

04:17.617 --> 04:19.209
So straighten up your tie,

04:19.252 --> 04:23.018
'cause you're
going to meet a lady.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.182
This is Lucy
the tank wipe trainer.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.250
What is exactly
does wiping a grimy tank

04:28.294 --> 04:31.263
have to do
with selling propane?

04:31.297 --> 04:32.264
Everything.

04:32.298 --> 04:35.461
When you talk tanks with the
customer, it won't just be talk.

04:35.501 --> 04:38.527
You'll have smelled, touched,
and tasted more tanks

04:38.571 --> 04:39.595
than he'll have ever seen.

04:39.639 --> 04:42.335
But I want to sell grills.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.900
When you're ready,
you will.

04:44.944 --> 04:46.104
All right,
now what you do

04:46.145 --> 04:48.409
is wipe from her head
down to her feet.

04:48.447 --> 04:51.883
No, no, Bobby,
remember...

04:51.918 --> 04:54.148
"Head to feet,
you won't cause a leak."

04:54.186 --> 04:58.486
"Feet to head,
everyone's dead."

05:04.830 --> 05:08.857
Tether tethered.

05:08.901 --> 05:09.959
BILL:
I'm going to be

05:10.002 --> 05:11.867
floating with the angels.

05:11.904 --> 05:13.701
What's that gun for?

05:13.739 --> 05:16.936
There is a small
to large chance

05:16.976 --> 05:20.173
you will develop
high altitude
pulmonary edema

05:20.212 --> 05:23.841
which means your capillaries
will flood with fluid,

05:23.883 --> 05:25.214
preventing adequate
oxygenation

05:25.251 --> 05:27.742
and a spiral
of worsening hypoxia,

05:27.787 --> 05:29.778
leading to a slow
and painful death.

05:29.822 --> 05:31.187
I don't think I want that.

05:31.223 --> 05:33.054
That's why I got the gun.

05:33.092 --> 05:35.026
If you start feeling
any shortness of breath,

05:35.061 --> 05:36.187
rub your belly,
and I will give you

05:36.228 --> 05:40.289
one of Dr. Dale's
.38 caliber pain pills.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.265
What?

05:41.300 --> 05:42.597
Don't worry,
I'm a good shot.

05:42.635 --> 05:46.435
Remove the sandbags,
Boomhauer!

05:46.472 --> 05:49.100
It works,
it works!

05:49.141 --> 05:52.304
Oh, it's so beautiful up here.

05:52.345 --> 05:55.212
Okay, when we released
the second tether,

05:55.247 --> 05:56.805
Bill should
gradually float

05:56.849 --> 05:59.511
30 feet into the air
as planned,

05:59.552 --> 06:02.043
or he will soar
uncontrollably

06:02.088 --> 06:04.852
into the stratosphere.

06:04.890 --> 06:05.618
Huh?

06:05.658 --> 06:08.149
Cut the cord, Boomhauer.

06:08.194 --> 06:09.218
Wait!

06:09.261 --> 06:13.391
He's giving the signal.

06:13.432 --> 06:14.956
Stick out your chest

06:15.001 --> 06:17.333
so I can get
a clean shot
at your heart!

06:17.370 --> 06:23.172
Oh, man, use that
them dang old
escape rope, man!

06:23.209 --> 06:26.610
(grunting)

06:26.646 --> 06:29.979
(screaming)

06:30.016 --> 06:32.280
(grunts)

06:32.318 --> 06:35.719
I made it!

06:35.755 --> 06:39.156
I'm all right!

06:39.191 --> 06:40.283
Ow!

06:40.326 --> 06:47.164
You're not
doing it right!

06:47.199 --> 06:49.429
(screaming)

06:49.468 --> 06:51.732
Ow, ow!

06:51.771 --> 06:55.798
Help!

06:55.841 --> 06:56.671
Hey, man, that dang,

06:56.709 --> 07:00.509
better shoot
that dang old
balloon, man!

07:08.954 --> 07:12.947
My eyes!

07:12.992 --> 07:16.393
Man, ma dang,
dang old Bill's
gone, man.

07:16.429 --> 07:18.090
Huh.

07:18.130 --> 07:20.360
BOBBY:
Ow.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.491
Ow.

07:21.534 --> 07:23.263
Ow.

07:23.302 --> 07:24.701
Congratulations, Bobby.

07:24.737 --> 07:27.535
That's the pain you get
from not taking shortcuts.

07:27.573 --> 07:28.471
(sighs)

07:28.507 --> 07:32.466
Okay.

07:35.181 --> 07:36.205
You know,
I think he may

07:36.248 --> 07:39.183
really have what it takes
to be a great propane salesman.

07:39.218 --> 07:40.549
Look, Peggy,

07:40.586 --> 07:43.020
he can barely make it
to his room.

07:43.055 --> 07:45.216
(Bobby collapses)

07:45.257 --> 07:47.418
Aw, he can't.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.690
Hey, Joe Jack.

07:49.729 --> 07:52.994
My dad's making me
calibrate all the flanges.

07:53.032 --> 07:55.159
Does this flange
look calibrated to you?

07:55.201 --> 07:57.135
Um, beats me.

07:57.169 --> 07:58.864
Never learned that stuff.

07:58.904 --> 08:01.395
I just know about
moving product.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.236
Wait a minute.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.107
Then why am I stuck
back here doing this?

08:05.144 --> 08:06.441
All that bunk
about learning
the fundamentals.

08:06.479 --> 08:13.976
It’s just a way to get me
to do his grunt work.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.390
Good afternoon,
sir... madam.

08:19.425 --> 08:22.519
May I help you with one
of our fine products?

08:22.561 --> 08:24.620
Well, do you
actually work here?

08:24.663 --> 08:27.598
Yes, I do.

08:35.607 --> 08:37.371
Bobby!
No!

08:37.409 --> 08:39.969
Buck, I apologize.

08:40.011 --> 08:41.376
This won't happen again.

08:41.413 --> 08:42.812
Hell, I hope it does.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.816
He just sold a Char-King!

08:44.850 --> 08:46.841
He what?

08:46.886 --> 08:48.353
Hit it out of the park

08:48.387 --> 08:49.877
on his first at bat.

08:49.922 --> 08:51.583
Bobby, I'm deputizing you...

08:51.624 --> 08:53.819
Sales boy!

08:53.859 --> 08:55.952
But, sir, he doesn't know
the fundamentals.

08:55.995 --> 08:58.088
He didn’t sell
a grill.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.757
Someone bought it
from him.

08:59.799 --> 09:00.925
He's not ready.

09:00.966 --> 09:01.933
Hey, Dad.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.764
What's this sound like?

09:03.803 --> 09:04.565
(rings bell)

09:04.603 --> 09:08.664
Sounds like I'm ready.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.678
Beginner's luck
is a curse, Bobby.

09:16.715 --> 09:18.114
If you don't learn
the basics,

09:18.150 --> 09:20.243
you'll be just another
also-ran

09:20.286 --> 09:22.117
instead
of a still-running.

09:22.154 --> 09:24.816
Well...

09:24.857 --> 09:27.587
doing those basics
might be your way

09:27.626 --> 09:29.116
but it's not my way.

09:29.161 --> 09:31.322
It's not my way;
it's the right way.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.662
Ha! If only there
were some easy way

09:34.700 --> 09:37.396
to figure out whose way
works better.

09:39.505 --> 09:40.699
All right, mister,
you're on.

09:40.739 --> 09:41.706
Fine!

09:41.740 --> 09:45.232
I cook two-inch steaks.

09:45.277 --> 09:46.744
That's my predilection.

09:46.779 --> 09:48.576
Is 22,000 BTUs
enough for me?

09:48.614 --> 09:50.582
BT... what's the what now?

09:50.616 --> 09:51.583
BTUs.

09:51.617 --> 09:52.982
You know the heat index.

09:53.018 --> 09:56.818
Uh... oh... well,
the thing with that is... uh...

09:56.856 --> 09:59.222
Yeah, I'd be interested
to hear that too, Bobby.

09:59.258 --> 10:02.250
The heat, huh?

10:02.294 --> 10:05.559
Well, it ain't going
to be as hot

10:05.598 --> 10:07.862
as the Dallas Cowboys
this season.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.492
Now, they got a team.

10:09.535 --> 10:10.627
Am I right?

10:10.669 --> 10:11.636
What are you talking about?

10:11.670 --> 10:12.830
Dallas stinks this year.

10:12.872 --> 10:14.203
Which is why you're going

10:14.240 --> 10:16.504
to spend Sunday afternoons
grilling

10:16.542 --> 10:18.510
instead of watching TV.

10:18.544 --> 10:19.511
Amen to that, brother.

10:24.950 --> 10:25.814
BILL:
Hello, anyone?

10:25.851 --> 10:27.944
Anybody?

10:27.987 --> 10:29.978
Santa?

10:30.022 --> 10:32.115
No.

10:32.157 --> 10:34.216
Yes!

10:34.260 --> 10:36.524
Yes!

10:36.562 --> 10:39.087
If you get your parents,
I will give you a toy.

10:39.131 --> 10:42.623
(groaning)

10:42.668 --> 10:45.364
(screaming)

10:45.404 --> 10:48.100
Good-bye, Santa.

10:48.140 --> 10:52.304
I love you.

10:52.344 --> 10:54.312
Plus with
a chrome reinforcement,

10:54.346 --> 10:57.008
you don't have to worry
about her blowing up.

10:57.049 --> 10:58.277
Grills blow up?!

10:58.317 --> 10:59.614
Oh, just the cheap ones.

10:59.652 --> 11:01.313
Uh, that's not
true, sir.

11:01.353 --> 11:04.083
Every grill we sell here
is absolutely safe

11:04.123 --> 11:05.488
and of the finest quality.

11:05.524 --> 11:06.855
Oh, are they?

11:06.892 --> 11:11.192
Joe Jack, what do you think
about the non-chrome grills?

11:11.230 --> 11:12.424
What, the widow makers?

11:12.464 --> 11:15.297
No, no, I have all the safety
information.

11:15.334 --> 11:17.768
Thanks, but I'd rather not
take any chances.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.771
I'll go with
the chrome one.

11:28.213 --> 11:30.443
You and you...
my truck, now.

11:30.482 --> 11:36.318
You two are
selling propane

11:36.355 --> 11:39.085
like it's a diseased pet
that needs a home.

11:39.124 --> 11:41.922
That stuff might fly
over at Thatherton Fuels,

11:41.961 --> 11:43.553
but I'm putting a stop to it.

11:43.595 --> 11:46.462
Mr. Strickland's happy,
the customers are happy.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.932
The only one not happy is you.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.458
But that's not our fault.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.800
It's 'cause you're
in a slump.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.829
How many times
do I have to tell you?

11:54.873 --> 11:57.706
My sales come in
at the end of the month.

11:57.743 --> 11:58.971
Okay.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.343
You go the stink on you,
and everybody can smell it.

12:05.384 --> 12:08.842
HANK:
And then, this morning,
I heard Bobby and Joe Jack

12:08.887 --> 12:11.378
refer to a customer as a mark.

12:11.423 --> 12:12.390
(sighs)

12:12.424 --> 12:14.790
Every single lesson
he's learning is wrong.

12:14.827 --> 12:16.488
Well, what do you expect?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.359
Joe Jack is racking up sales

12:18.397 --> 12:19.864
and from what your son
tells me

12:19.898 --> 12:21.798
you don't have squat.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.428
Children imitate success, Hank.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.995
I catch my students
imitating me all the time.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.631
Peggy, you know my system.

12:28.674 --> 12:30.039
I'll have plenty of success

12:30.075 --> 12:33.511
when all my sales come in
at the end of the month.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.206
We cannot afford to take
that chance, Hank.

12:35.247 --> 12:37.477
According to Rob Reiner,
these years are critical

12:37.516 --> 12:39.746
for Bobby's core value
development.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.184
You've got to dazzle him
with sales

12:41.220 --> 12:43.620
or he may never
listen to you again.

12:43.655 --> 12:45.714
Come on, pick up the pace!

12:45.758 --> 12:47.953
But... But that’s not my system.

12:47.993 --> 12:50.860
Then get a new one.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.233
Just pretend
you’re one of those jerks

12:56.268 --> 12:57.895
at the Sales-a-thon.

12:57.936 --> 12:59.961
Okay, on three:

13:00.005 --> 13:02.803
One, two, three.

13:02.841 --> 13:05.139
For Bobby!

13:13.452 --> 13:14.476
Hello.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.216
Uh, I would like to sell you
a grill now.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.518
Well, we’re just lookin'.

13:18.557 --> 13:21.958
Uh, look no further?

13:21.994 --> 13:23.621
Oh, great, here we go.

13:23.662 --> 13:26.722
Yep, here we go
on an exciting journey

13:26.765 --> 13:28.995
that ends with you
buying a grill.

13:29.034 --> 13:31.059
(chuckling)

13:31.103 --> 13:37.838
Uh, you want me to tell you
a joke?

13:37.876 --> 13:40.140
So I pulled that tooth
I was telling you about.

13:40.179 --> 13:42.943
DALE (on radio):
Arlen?

13:42.981 --> 13:44.846
Do you read me?

13:44.883 --> 13:46.714
Come in, Dale, Boomhauer?

13:46.752 --> 13:48.617
Bill, is that you?

13:48.654 --> 13:50.986
You didn't say over. Over.

13:51.023 --> 13:52.388
Dale! Thank God!

13:52.424 --> 13:53.823
I need water!

13:53.859 --> 13:55.690
I'm in a tree!

13:55.727 --> 13:58.059
Be more specific!
What town?

13:58.097 --> 14:00.895
What type of tree? Over.

14:00.933 --> 14:03.265
(sobbing):
I don't know!

14:03.302 --> 14:04.701
I fell asleep!

14:04.736 --> 14:08.467
Oh, wait!
Here come a bunch of kids!

14:08.507 --> 14:10.839
Oh, thank God somebody came.

14:10.876 --> 14:13.436
Hey, you.
What you doing up there?

14:13.479 --> 14:14.446
Did Eduardo send you?

14:14.480 --> 14:19.383
No, see, the wind changed,
and I'm just so dizzy...

14:19.418 --> 14:21.386
How come you're hanging
from a tree?

14:21.420 --> 14:22.512
You a piñata?

14:22.554 --> 14:25.421
Hey, piñata,
it's my birthday!

14:25.457 --> 14:26.890
(snickering)

14:26.925 --> 14:29.393
Oh, no.

14:29.428 --> 14:33.865
(boys laughing)

14:33.899 --> 14:38.495
BILL:
No! No! Quit it! No!

14:38.537 --> 14:40.437
(boys laughing)

14:40.472 --> 14:43.066
Wow. Bill's new ballooning
buddies sound like a hoot!

14:43.108 --> 14:45.770
I should've gone first.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.373
Uh, Mr. Strickland,
I'm glad you're here.

14:52.417 --> 14:55.147
I know I'm usually kicking it
into gear this time of the month

14:55.187 --> 14:56.950
and I promise I...

14:56.989 --> 14:58.684
Aw, don't sweat it, Old Top!

14:58.724 --> 15:00.316
So you're in a slump.

15:00.359 --> 15:05.797
Now, come on, I still got plenty
of use for you yet.

15:06.265 --> 15:07.892
Thatheron.

15:07.933 --> 15:09.798
Gentlemen, you all
know Hank Hill,

15:09.835 --> 15:11.325
my number-one salesman
12 years running.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.999
Stop stalling, Buck.
Where's your bet?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.837
Right here.
I'm betting Hank!

15:16.875 --> 15:17.842
What?!

15:17.876 --> 15:20.674
If you win, you get
him for the week.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.236
All right. I call.

15:22.281 --> 15:24.977
But, sir, you always
bet Joe Jack.

15:25.017 --> 15:27.815
Uh, I can't this time.
He's selling.

15:27.853 --> 15:29.753
You're crapping
the big goose egg!

15:29.788 --> 15:32.052
All right, bet's on.

15:32.090 --> 15:33.352
Show'em!

15:33.392 --> 15:35.917
Two pair, sevens high.

15:35.961 --> 15:37.223
Full house.

15:37.262 --> 15:38.229
No!

15:38.263 --> 15:40.231
That's where them
aces were hiding.

15:40.265 --> 15:44.861
Hank, you stand there
and look like a poker chip.

15:44.903 --> 15:48.066
I'll come get
you in a minute.

15:48.106 --> 15:51.473
(sighs)

15:51.510 --> 15:55.469
Bobby, everything I told you

15:55.514 --> 15:58.483
about sales being patience
and character

15:58.517 --> 15:59.882
it's all still true.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.978
I didn't show much
of either, and now
I'm paying the price.

16:03.021 --> 16:05.512
Please promise me you'll
learn from my mistakes.

16:05.557 --> 16:11.518
Uh, okay.

16:16.268 --> 16:17.064
Come on, Bobby.

16:17.102 --> 16:21.596
There's some nuns out
there who don't know
diddly about markup.

16:24.843 --> 16:26.572
When I open this handkerchief,

16:26.612 --> 16:30.776
you're credit card will
magically be back in one piece.

16:30.816 --> 16:32.613
Alla-ka-sizzle.

16:32.651 --> 16:33.583
Aw, geez.

16:33.619 --> 16:35.610
(uncomfortable laugh)

16:39.157 --> 16:44.493
This here's our crown jewel.

16:44.529 --> 16:46.963
Our wet apron contest.

16:46.999 --> 16:51.766
You do good by me,
I'll let you work the hose.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.506
You told me I could bang
the dents out of my
canister with a hammer!

16:56.541 --> 16:58.702
Are you trying to kill me?!

16:58.744 --> 17:02.578
I, uh... what I meant
to say was, uh...

17:02.614 --> 17:04.275
I'll get the manager.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.717
Uh, Bobby, I'm not good
with unhappy customers.

17:07.752 --> 17:09.846
That's your old man's
specialty.

17:09.887 --> 17:13.255
If they ask for me,
I'm, uh... uh...

17:13.291 --> 17:15.385
Yeah. Good luck, Bob!

17:15.426 --> 17:16.689
(customers clamoring)

17:16.728 --> 17:18.820
...speak to the
manager, please!

17:18.864 --> 17:20.525
Please be patient, ma'am.

17:20.565 --> 17:22.657
I can't find my pen.

17:22.701 --> 17:27.798
Joe Jack, so help me God.
If you took my pen again.

17:27.839 --> 17:32.003
You don't know anything
about the BTUs on this grill!

17:32.044 --> 17:36.640
It took me four hours
to cook my two-inch steaks!

17:36.682 --> 17:39.116
I, uh, maybe...
Look, free cookies!

17:39.151 --> 17:40.948
Cookies?
I'm a diabetic.

17:40.986 --> 17:42.317
Get back here!

17:42.354 --> 17:44.618
He's gettin' away!
Follow him!

17:44.656 --> 17:48.251
Uh, sure, this grill is perfect
for indoor grilling.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.385
Or heating.

17:49.428 --> 17:52.955
And we at Thatherton
guarantee that the gas

17:52.998 --> 17:55.523
will never ever run out.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.967
(quietly):
He won me in a card game.

17:58.003 --> 17:59.971
Get out of here
while you still can.

18:00.005 --> 18:04.965
Run! Run! Run!

18:05.010 --> 18:08.537
That way!

18:08.580 --> 18:11.105
I just saw a jet ski payment
run out the door.

18:11.149 --> 18:12.116
What happened?

18:12.150 --> 18:14.118
Look, I can sell propane
upside-down and blindfolded,

18:14.152 --> 18:19.385
but not with my integrity
tied behind my back.

18:19.424 --> 18:24.862
There must be some sort
of honest work that needs
to be done around here.

18:34.506 --> 18:37.168
Hey, mister, have you seen
Hank Hill?

18:37.209 --> 18:39.336
Dad?

18:39.378 --> 18:41.346
What are you doing
wiping tanks?

18:41.380 --> 18:44.508
I thought that grunt work
was only for rookies.

18:44.549 --> 18:45.516
(sighs)

18:45.550 --> 18:49.111
Bobby, did you listen
to anything I tried
to tell you?

18:49.154 --> 18:51.179
The great ones
practice the basics.

18:51.223 --> 18:55.125
So you thought I could be
a great one, too?

18:55.160 --> 18:58.721
I trusted you with the
flanges on your second day.

18:58.764 --> 19:02.029
I think that says it all.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.034
Things are kind of

19:03.068 --> 19:05.036
melting down
over at Strickland.

19:05.070 --> 19:06.560
We need you back.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.698
Well, I still got
a debt to pay here.

19:08.740 --> 19:12.676
Uh, Mr. Strickland
gave me the 20 bucks
to pay Thatheron.

19:12.711 --> 19:16.545
Huh. That must just be
the first installment.

19:16.581 --> 19:19.209
Let's go satisfy
some customers.

19:22.354 --> 19:28.315
(dry croaking)

19:38.437 --> 19:39.529
Your turn.

19:40.972 --> 19:46.933
(crowd clamoring)

19:50.615 --> 19:52.583
All right, who can I help first?

19:52.617 --> 19:53.948
What seems to be the problem?

19:53.985 --> 19:55.213
Well, my tank ran out.

19:55.253 --> 19:56.811
It was supposed to be
a 50-gallon tank.

19:56.855 --> 19:58.720
Ma'am, that's only
a ten-gallon tank.

19:58.757 --> 20:00.486
Must've been
a miscommunication.

20:00.525 --> 20:02.857
I'll take care of it.

20:02.894 --> 20:09.766
I'm glad you are now
officially satisfied.

20:11.536 --> 20:13.197
That was some day,
huh, Bobby?

20:13.238 --> 20:18.938
Actually,
it was pretty horrible.

20:18.977 --> 20:21.775
Tick... ticka-ticka.
Come on, baby.

20:21.813 --> 20:24.941
I'm sorry you're not
going to get the sales
award this year, Dad.

20:24.983 --> 20:28.248
Maybe I should
get back to Lucy.

20:28.286 --> 20:30.652
It's foot to head, right?

20:30.689 --> 20:33.453
No, then everyone's
dead, Bobby.

20:33.492 --> 20:36.427
Remember, it's head to feet,
but we’ll work on that tomorrow.

20:36.461 --> 20:38.554
Why don't you go lock
the door for me?

20:38.597 --> 20:40.224
♪ Closin' time! ♪

20:40.265 --> 20:41.732
♪ Joe Jack is the winner ♪

20:41.766 --> 20:43.825
♪ And Hank Hill is the loser. ♪

20:43.869 --> 20:47.100
Yeah, yeah, okay.

20:47.138 --> 20:51.131
I'll take this
one, too, slumpy.

20:51.176 --> 20:52.666
And what can I
do you for?

20:52.711 --> 20:55.236
You're the guy
who gave me the brochures.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.338
Hmm.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.406
The first time I read them,
they made no sense.

20:58.450 --> 21:00.543
But then, it started
sinking in...

21:00.585 --> 21:02.143
It usually does.

21:02.187 --> 21:03.814
BOBBY:
So the guy says,

21:03.855 --> 21:07.222
"I'm switching my trailer park
to propane.

21:07.259 --> 21:10.592
I need 500 tanks."

21:10.629 --> 21:12.688
A minute before closing!

21:12.731 --> 21:14.460
You should've seen Joe Jack!

21:14.499 --> 21:17.798
He pulled a flask out of his
desk and started drinking.

21:17.836 --> 21:20.202
It was so funny!

21:20.238 --> 21:23.071
Yep, every Grillstravaganza
is different,

21:23.108 --> 21:27.272
but they always end the same.
