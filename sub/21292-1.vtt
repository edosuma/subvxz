01:36.090 --> 01:39.690
THE EMPTY HOURS

02:43.630 --> 02:45.290
Sebas! I'm glad you made it.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.400
What's up. Uncle Gerry?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.960
- How are your mother and sister?
- They're well, thanks

02:54.670 --> 02:58.000
I asked you to come here because
I need someone I can trust,

02:58.180 --> 02:59.840
to look after my place.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.180
It will be a good experience for you.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.150
and you'll earn a bit of money

03:06.320 --> 03:08.310
In that case. I'm all for it

03:09.790 --> 03:14.050
All this shit with the medica
check ups and lab tests

03:14.190 --> 03:16.280
is going to take a couple of weeks

03:16.660 --> 03:20.860
Maybe more, maybe less,
it depends on what the doctors say.

03:21.030 --> 03:24.130
Don't you worry Uncle.
I'll stay as long as it takes.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.100
I left everything
settled in Jalapa anyway.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.630
That's great, son.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.530
The clothes lines are here

03:31.680 --> 03:33.640
and the laundry sink is there.

03:34.950 --> 03:39.110
Room number 9,
where my truck is, is not for rent

03:39.280 --> 03:40.110
Why not?

03:40.280 --> 03:43.720
It's full of paint cans,
cement and other stuff

03:43.850 --> 03:46.150
I was fixing up the motel a bit.

03:46.620 --> 03:50.120
but it will have to wait
because of this medical stuff

03:50.790 --> 03:53.920
When I get back, I'm going
to change some roof tiles

03:54.060 --> 03:55.730
and add some over here

03:56.330 --> 04:00.430
I'm going to pull out some diseased palms
and paint the place.

04:00.570 --> 04:02.400
I must get it looking ship-shape.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.270
This is the linen cupboard,

04:08.410 --> 04:11.180
where cleaning products are also kept

04:11.920 --> 04:15.720
You have to keep it locked
or things get lost.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.820
Lucha. The laundrywoman,
never notifies when she'll be coming,

04:20.990 --> 04:23.520
but she is very dependable.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.180
Does she do the cleaning?

04:25.360 --> 04:27.190
No. She only washes and irons.

04:27.760 --> 04:31.260
I had to fire the maid a few days ago

04:31.700 --> 04:35.000
The night-watchman said
he would find someone else

04:35.170 --> 04:39.470
If she doesn't come today.
you'll have to do the cleaning yourself

04:39.740 --> 04:43.080
- I'm here to look after the motel
- Look...

04:43.250 --> 04:46.770
to manage a hotel.
you have to do a bit of everything

04:46.950 --> 04:48.820
It will only be for a few days.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.920
The rooms are a very similar.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.520
Change the sheets and towels each time.

04:55.690 --> 04:59.820
And make sure that there is always
a box of paper handkerchiefs by the bed

05:00.100 --> 05:00.930
Ok

05:05.300 --> 05:07.460
This little drum is for beers.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.830
sodas, condoms or whatever they need

05:14.080 --> 05:15.740
You put the stuff out here

05:15.910 --> 05:18.680
and turn it. So you don't bother them.

05:23.050 --> 05:27.220
The most important thing
in this business is discretion.

05:27.790 --> 05:28.590
Don't worry.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.930
Well. Sebas...

05:38.170 --> 05:40.190
I'm leaving you in charge of my motel.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.430
- Don't fool around too much...
- No, of course not

05:43.610 --> 05:44.800
Do be careful,

05:45.740 --> 05:48.110
there's some crazy dudes round here

05:48.650 --> 05:50.240
I can look after myself

05:50.410 --> 05:51.540
Really, son,

05:52.820 --> 05:54.480
the situation is rough.

05:58.590 --> 06:01.180
- Let me know how things are going.
- Sure

07:31.250 --> 07:32.580
Yes, Sir.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.110
They are single story houses.

07:36.190 --> 07:40.210
They have two bedrooms, a dining
room area with an open kitchen

07:42.760 --> 07:44.850
It's a compound with nine houses

07:45.030 --> 07:47.330
with a shared swimming pool

07:47.930 --> 07:50.020
They also have access to the beach.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.960
Yes, they are very nice

07:53.300 --> 07:54.460
Very nice.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.630
Why don't you come to see them?

07:58.210 --> 07:59.180
Yes.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.570
I'll show you the house
and explain our financing options.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.100
Yes?

08:05.280 --> 08:06.540
Perfect

08:07.120 --> 08:09.240
Hold on

09:38.510 --> 09:39.370
Coconuts?

09:49.150 --> 09:50.480
What'll you have, dude?

09:50.720 --> 09:51.810
This one.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.190
That one?

10:13.540 --> 10:15.980
Hold on. Dude, I'll put a straw in

10:19.120 --> 10:20.450
Here's a ten

10:21.180 --> 10:22.670
Do you have any change?

10:23.020 --> 10:24.710
haven't got any.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.650
Better take another one

10:28.790 --> 10:29.880
No. One is enough

10:30.130 --> 10:32.560
What'll we do then? Don't have change.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.160
Let's flip a coin.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.200
If you win I'll give you
the coconut for free

10:38.570 --> 10:42.230
But if I win I get to keep the change.

10:42.710 --> 10:43.670
Oh yeah?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.110
Hold on

10:49.280 --> 10:50.400
All set. Dude.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.310
Do come back.

11:18.570 --> 11:19.540
The key?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.650
I'm sorry

11:31.950 --> 11:34.790
What?
Are we going to flip that coin or not?

11:38.700 --> 11:39.660
You're on

11:41.000 --> 11:42.160
- What?
- You flip it

11:43.430 --> 11:44.370
Heads

11:46.170 --> 11:47.190
Tough luck!

11:47.370 --> 11:48.670
It's heads

11:48.840 --> 11:50.030
It's tails, my friend

11:50.210 --> 11:51.500
Tails? No way

11:52.210 --> 11:53.870
- It's tails
- Don't cheat

11:54.040 --> 11:55.530
Me? I'm playing fair.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.740
- You're playing fair?
- Yes

11:58.180 --> 11:59.050
Come on.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.580
What's your name?

12:01.380 --> 12:02.350
Jacinto

12:03.220 --> 12:04.410
At your service

12:05.620 --> 12:07.280
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

12:08.860 --> 12:11.520
- See you
- I'll be back for my other coconut.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.160
Yes, bye

14:50.990 --> 14:52.820
- Good afternoon!
- Hello.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.510
I'm sorry but this room is not available.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.860
But the porch is vacant

14:59.030 --> 15:01.330
True, but it isn't fit for rent.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.430
So, what do we do now?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.260
- We can do it right here
- No way.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.660
- You're so boring!
- It's not that

15:13.480 --> 15:15.940
The rest are all available

15:17.710 --> 15:19.540
Is that one next door vacant?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.010
Room 10, yes it is.

15:21.180 --> 15:22.710
That one then

15:22.890 --> 15:25.350
I'll bring your key straight away. Sorry.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.660
I like this place

15:41.400 --> 15:42.370
What?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.770
I like this little motel.

15:46.740 --> 15:48.270
It has charm.

15:49.850 --> 15:52.280
It's very different from the last one

15:53.220 --> 15:56.240
Didn't you like the last one?

15:57.050 --> 15:58.020
Not really.

15:59.220 --> 16:01.420
It was quite decadent

16:02.860 --> 16:05.220
And what about the smell...

16:05.390 --> 16:08.230
Yuck Don't remind me!

16:13.200 --> 16:16.070
Well. If you want
we could meet at your work

16:17.310 --> 16:18.970
It's a bit far for me but.

16:19.140 --> 16:19.940
No

16:20.410 --> 16:22.710
I've already said I don't want that.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.270
You're right.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.820
The truth is this place isn't bad at all.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.610
Simple. No luxuries.

16:33.290 --> 16:34.650
but worth it

16:36.890 --> 16:38.690
And it's very discreet.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.330
Far from everything.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.030
Maybe this way
we could meet more often?

16:46.170 --> 16:48.760
Miranda. Don't start

16:50.910 --> 16:54.070
I'm just saying it
because nobody knows you here.

17:12.660 --> 17:13.920
I'm going to shower.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.010
Miranda? Are the towels out there?

17:24.170 --> 17:25.660
I can't see any here

17:29.050 --> 17:30.010
No

17:44.230 --> 17:45.190
Reception.

17:47.630 --> 17:49.290
I'll bring them in a moment

17:50.130 --> 17:51.100
Yes.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.400
Better pass them through here.

18:04.050 --> 18:07.910
- Sorry. The maid didn't show today
- Don't worry, thanks.

18:14.890 --> 18:16.360
Here are the towels.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.200
Are you ready, Miranda?

19:01.770 --> 19:03.970
I'll take you out for seafood

19:33.270 --> 19:34.570
- Hi
- Good afternoon

19:34.740 --> 19:36.530
- Mr Severino?
- Yes

19:36.670 --> 19:39.300
I am Sebastian, Gerardo's nephew.

19:40.110 --> 19:41.270
Pleased to meet you

19:42.140 --> 19:45.240
- Can I help you?
- No thanks, I'll take care of it.

19:47.580 --> 19:48.710
Feeling hungry?

19:48.850 --> 19:50.150
A bit, yes.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.950
- It looks as though it might rain
- Yes.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.620
As the song says, 'It looks like rain,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.590
the sky is turning grey.'

20:04.170 --> 20:06.130
- Is that your dog?
- Yes

20:06.300 --> 20:08.430
- What's its name?
- Bodoque

20:11.940 --> 20:15.140
- I'll be inside. If you need anything...
- Alright

20:15.310 --> 20:17.840
I'll call you if I need something.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.140
Thank you.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.690
Come here, Bodo

20:35.060 --> 20:36.860
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.560
- The motel seems quite full tonight.
- Yes

20:41.700 --> 20:46.040
After partying in Tecolutla,
they came here. So it filled up

20:46.710 --> 20:49.740
It's not full every day but it's full now.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.180
Look

20:52.350 --> 20:55.510
my uncle said that you
were going to find a new maid

20:55.680 --> 20:57.680
- Didn't she come?
- No

20:58.250 --> 20:59.880
wonder what happened.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.750
But...

21:02.360 --> 21:05.350
don't worry, she'll come tomorrow.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.690
Could we find someone else?
I need someone urgently

21:08.860 --> 21:10.860
Melinda will come tomorrow

21:13.870 --> 21:16.500
- Make sure that she does
- Don't worry

21:16.670 --> 21:18.140
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.950
Santa Lucia Condominiums.

25:21.950 --> 25:24.250
Good morning Sir, how are you?

25:25.420 --> 25:26.390
Well

25:27.520 --> 25:30.050
I have a client interested
in house number 3.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.780
No... number 4

25:32.290 --> 25:33.280
Yes.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.900
He said that he'd let me know this week

25:37.770 --> 25:39.730
I would be delighted too!

25:43.540 --> 25:46.010
I've advertised all over the place

25:49.440 --> 25:51.210
But things are slow.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.750
People lack funds
and banks are making it very difficult.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.750
Yes, of course.

26:07.030 --> 26:08.460
No. I gave my word

26:09.530 --> 26:14.060
I gave my word and won't leave
until the condo is sold

26:15.640 --> 26:16.970
Don't worry.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.880
Even if I have to stay another two months.

27:03.390 --> 27:04.350
Hello?

27:04.890 --> 27:06.050
Are we on for today?

27:09.760 --> 27:11.520
I called you several times.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.990
Yes. I know that being
a manager and family man

27:18.130 --> 27:21.070
Leaves you with little time
for other things

27:23.570 --> 27:24.870
Just kidding

27:29.380 --> 27:30.710
Can you make it?

27:34.080 --> 27:35.050
Are you sure?

27:38.320 --> 27:40.620
We can leave it for another day...

27:47.460 --> 27:49.950
So we'll meet over there directly?

27:53.600 --> 27:55.730
At 2 o'clock. As usual?

28:32.040 --> 28:33.200
Look at you!

28:34.180 --> 28:35.840
You must be young Sebastian

28:36.650 --> 28:38.840
- Lucha?
- At your service

28:39.820 --> 28:41.010
Have you been here long?

28:41.180 --> 28:44.950
I arrived a little while ago
but I didn't want to bother you

28:47.190 --> 28:49.120
Did you notice anything strange?

28:49.290 --> 28:50.820
Strange in what way?

28:51.330 --> 28:53.790
Like people trying to get into the rooms.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.090
Don't worry young man.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.100
nothing ever happens here.

28:59.300 --> 29:02.630
Well. I'll be at the reception
if you need me

29:02.800 --> 29:03.600
Alright

29:03.740 --> 29:05.400
- Excuse me
- Bye.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.310
Hello?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.280
Hello?

29:17.250 --> 29:18.910
What's up. Uncle Gerry?

29:19.860 --> 29:20.820
What?

29:21.660 --> 29:22.620
Hello?

29:25.160 --> 29:26.630
I can barely hear you.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.360
Hello?

29:33.000 --> 29:34.330
Can you hear me better?

29:35.500 --> 29:37.130
Can you hear me?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.570
Hello?

29:39.070 --> 29:41.070
Ok. I can hear you over here.

29:41.540 --> 29:42.510
No. Wait

29:47.620 --> 29:48.580
Hello?

29:50.290 --> 29:51.750
Yes, I hear you now

29:52.720 --> 29:53.880
What's up?

29:55.890 --> 29:56.860
Hello?

30:15.910 --> 30:17.040
What's up. Man?

30:22.820 --> 30:23.610
I'm back

30:23.790 --> 30:26.080
- How did it go, son?
- Good.

32:45.460 --> 32:47.260
I've got to go now.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.190
- Have you ironed everything?
- Just left some sheets.

32:52.430 --> 32:55.530
It looks like rain,
could you bring them in later?

32:56.200 --> 32:57.730
Yes, I'll take care of it.

32:57.910 --> 32:59.100
I'm off then, bye.

33:01.810 --> 33:02.780
Lucha?

33:04.750 --> 33:08.080
Could you help me out
until I can find a new maid?

33:08.250 --> 33:09.510
No. I can't.

33:09.650 --> 33:12.810
I only come here
as a favor to Mr Gerardo.

33:12.990 --> 33:16.750
I work full-time at another hotel
so don't have the time

33:17.230 --> 33:20.560
- It would just be for a few days.
- Honestly, I can't.

33:20.730 --> 33:25.030
But I'll see if I can find you
a reliable hardworking girl.

33:25.630 --> 33:28.730
- Please do.
- Don't worry. I'll find you one

33:48.960 --> 33:50.080
Good afternoon.

33:54.460 --> 33:55.430
Thanks

33:58.530 --> 34:00.470
No. Leave it open

34:00.640 --> 34:02.900
so my partner can see I'm already here.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.410
Thanks

34:51.650 --> 34:53.350
Sorry to bother you.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.850
Fetching the sheets. It started to pour

34:56.020 --> 34:59.020
You can wait here
There's no point in getting wet.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.260
Aren't you too young to be working here?

35:12.710 --> 35:14.200
It's my uncle's motel.

35:14.410 --> 35:16.880
He had to leave so I'm replacing him.

35:17.050 --> 35:19.670
Just for a few days, until he gets back.

35:19.850 --> 35:21.780
That's very bold of him,

35:22.580 --> 35:25.580
leaving you here alone
when you're so young.

35:26.550 --> 35:27.580
Maybe

35:28.520 --> 35:30.680
but I'm not all that young...

35:31.560 --> 35:34.220
You can't be over 16. Right?

35:36.760 --> 35:38.730
I'm turning 18 in three months

35:42.970 --> 35:44.460
I almost got it.

36:00.790 --> 36:02.220
So, what's it like here?

36:02.660 --> 36:04.150
- What?
- Here

36:06.460 --> 36:07.660
Boring

36:08.330 --> 36:09.960
There isn't much to do.

36:10.130 --> 36:12.570
You must find out all sorts of stuff...

36:13.470 --> 36:15.460
I'd rather not meddle.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.140
But you must wonder
who the people who come here are.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.100
Like those guys over there

36:30.320 --> 36:32.650
I bet he's a young guy from around here.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.880
Well. He did look young

36:36.090 --> 36:37.920
About 21 or 22?

36:39.760 --> 36:41.090
More or less.

36:41.260 --> 36:44.250
I bet it's his first time in a motel

36:45.370 --> 36:47.560
He didn't look like a first-timer.

36:47.770 --> 36:48.740
Really?

36:49.870 --> 36:52.140
The plot thickens.

36:53.780 --> 36:56.400
- The girl looked...
- Don't tell me that

36:56.840 --> 36:58.330
Better tell me

36:59.680 --> 37:01.150
what car they drive.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.980
They were riding a motorbike

37:05.150 --> 37:06.310
A small motorbike

37:06.490 --> 37:08.280
That makes it easier

37:08.460 --> 37:10.750
she's a hooker he picked up.

37:12.660 --> 37:13.630
No?

37:18.970 --> 37:20.960
Don't tell me they're engaged!

37:25.810 --> 37:27.170
How disappointing!

37:28.810 --> 37:30.940
I didn't expect them to be so banal

37:31.350 --> 37:32.310
So what?

37:33.150 --> 37:35.140
So ordinary

37:35.320 --> 37:36.780
So boring

37:38.720 --> 37:41.190
They didn't look
as though they were bored

37:42.420 --> 37:45.720
Not while their passion lasts,
but that is temporary

38:01.010 --> 38:02.980
Look. A ray of sunshine.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.180
Excuse me.

42:07.520 --> 42:08.490
Hello?

42:09.590 --> 42:10.780
What's up. Mom?

42:12.330 --> 42:13.290
What?

42:14.300 --> 42:15.660
I can barely hear you.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.460
Hold on. Don't hang up.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.160
Any news of my uncle?

42:29.780 --> 42:30.970
You don't say...

42:33.710 --> 42:35.010
Calm down. Mom...

42:35.950 --> 42:37.940
You know what my uncle's like

42:46.630 --> 42:48.490
And what did the doctors say?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.600
So when are they going
to do the new lab tests?

43:16.220 --> 43:17.690
What's up with the maid?

43:18.330 --> 43:19.520
She hasn't come.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.960
I'll try to get another one tomorrow

43:25.570 --> 43:27.400
Because Ms Melinda didn't show.

43:27.570 --> 43:30.870
You've been saying that
since the other day!

43:31.370 --> 43:35.830
It's hard to find someone
who is reliable and trustworthy

43:36.010 --> 43:37.670
- You already said that
- Yes.

43:37.850 --> 43:39.440
My uncle asked you...

43:39.580 --> 43:41.450
I'm doing the cleaning myself...

43:42.350 --> 43:44.320
- Tough luck
- What do you mean?

43:44.450 --> 43:47.250
- Nothing can be done
- What do you mean?

43:47.420 --> 43:51.410
Well. There just isn't anybody
who is reliable and trustworthy

43:51.590 --> 43:54.060
You were asked
to take care of it days ago!

43:54.230 --> 43:55.820
I know, I'm telling you!

43:56.600 --> 43:58.090
You're telling me?

44:00.070 --> 44:01.160
I'll be right back.

45:55.750 --> 45:57.740
The building is over 300 ft2

45:57.920 --> 46:00.390
plus another 100 ft2 of private garden,

46:00.550 --> 46:04.180
not to mention the swimming pool
and the beach access

46:05.860 --> 46:09.820
I truly believe it's one
of the best deals in the area.

46:11.670 --> 46:13.190
The master bedroom.

46:13.370 --> 46:16.300
which also has two built-in double beds.

46:19.040 --> 46:19.900
Over there

46:20.070 --> 46:23.570
is a large and comfortable bathroom.
you can go in.

46:27.010 --> 46:28.500
And this is the kitchen

46:29.220 --> 46:32.410
There's quite a large space
for a pantry over here.

46:32.850 --> 46:34.050
It is very versatile.

46:34.220 --> 46:36.690
you can adapt it to your needs

46:37.060 --> 46:39.920
The open plan
is very practical and functional,

46:40.090 --> 46:42.390
and gives the house a very nice touch.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.670
The whole house is going to smell of food

47:41.160 --> 47:44.180
MAID WANTED

49:55.890 --> 49:56.860
Hello!

50:43.040 --> 50:44.060
Hi, Mario

50:46.040 --> 50:49.410
I just wanted to say
that I'll be waiting for you

50:50.110 --> 50:51.300
Don't be long.

51:17.000 --> 51:17.970
Hello?

51:19.740 --> 51:21.210
I can barely hear you.

51:24.010 --> 51:25.100
Hold on

51:25.750 --> 51:26.710
Wait a moment

51:38.160 --> 51:39.820
Yes, I can hear you better.

51:40.760 --> 51:41.960
What's up?

51:45.870 --> 51:47.300
You're with Uncle Gerry?

51:51.240 --> 51:52.670
And what did they say?

51:56.940 --> 51:57.910
What?

51:58.750 --> 52:00.240
Yes, a truck drove by.

52:43.120 --> 52:44.610
I know what I'm doing.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.830
Just relax and look after my uncle

52:50.060 --> 52:51.930
Don't worry, everything is fine

53:04.810 --> 53:05.780
Are you ok?

53:08.350 --> 53:09.320
Yes.

53:10.580 --> 53:12.780
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

53:13.290 --> 53:14.250
Don't worry,

53:14.960 --> 53:16.320
I'll get your key

53:17.260 --> 53:19.350
Relax, I'm not in a hurry

53:53.830 --> 53:54.850
Coming!

53:56.160 --> 53:57.660
Impatient horny bastards!

54:13.210 --> 54:14.180
Hello

54:17.320 --> 54:18.280
Thanks

54:34.940 --> 54:37.700
- You shouldn't have
- It was my fault you got dirty

54:42.840 --> 54:44.040
You'll never guess!

54:45.580 --> 54:47.510
- What?
- About the clients.

54:48.220 --> 54:49.310
You're on

54:49.780 --> 54:50.720
First clue

54:51.590 --> 54:54.050
They arrived in a brand new pickup

54:57.520 --> 54:59.990
He must be a well off cattle rancher.

55:00.530 --> 55:02.500
around 50 or 55, right?

55:02.900 --> 55:04.230
Yes, to the rancher.

55:05.470 --> 55:07.590
And he brought his secretary...

55:08.870 --> 55:10.300
25 years old

55:10.440 --> 55:12.630
Ranchers don't have secretaries.

55:13.570 --> 55:15.340
But you got the age right

55:19.750 --> 55:21.010
Some table dancer?

55:22.650 --> 55:23.620
No?

55:27.950 --> 55:28.750
I give up.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.760
Let's say they have a lot in common.

55:33.130 --> 55:35.750
Then she's his wife. No?

55:36.230 --> 55:38.250
Or girlfriend, or lover.

55:38.430 --> 55:39.360
That's right...

55:40.830 --> 55:43.200
but they have something specific.

55:44.300 --> 55:45.270
What do you mean?

55:45.670 --> 55:46.600
You've lost me.

55:48.410 --> 55:50.000
I'll make it easy

55:51.650 --> 55:54.110
they play for the other team

56:01.420 --> 56:02.720
They're gay!

56:04.990 --> 56:06.080
You got it

56:08.500 --> 56:09.660
Here's your prize

56:09.830 --> 56:10.800
Thanks

56:12.530 --> 56:15.020
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- No, go ahead

56:34.020 --> 56:35.890
My name's Miranda. What's yours?

56:36.360 --> 56:37.320
Sebastian Ramirez Novoa, at your service.

56:41.900 --> 56:44.330
Pleased to meet you. Mr. Ramirez Novoa.

56:47.870 --> 56:49.230
Are you from round here?

56:49.400 --> 56:50.670
No. I'm from Jalapa

57:04.180 --> 57:05.170
A girlfriend?

57:06.720 --> 57:08.150
I'm so nosy, aren't?

57:10.090 --> 57:12.790
Since you're in on other peoples' privacy,

57:12.990 --> 57:16.620
it seemed ok to ask you.
but you don't have to answer...

57:17.360 --> 57:18.660
No. Don't worry.

57:21.370 --> 57:23.230
Well. I do have a friend. But...

57:24.500 --> 57:25.940
she isn't my girlfriend

57:27.070 --> 57:29.540
So you just kiss and stuff?

57:33.110 --> 57:34.080
Yes.

57:35.520 --> 57:36.710
But she left

57:37.520 --> 57:38.480
Why?

57:40.720 --> 57:42.920
Because she met another guy

57:45.230 --> 57:46.720
You were too slow...

57:48.860 --> 57:50.300
Find another one then!

57:50.960 --> 57:52.660
Love comes and goes.

57:53.370 --> 57:54.330
Right

57:58.770 --> 57:59.740
How about you?

58:02.210 --> 58:03.200
Me?

58:04.640 --> 58:06.510
My thing isn't at all serious

58:08.550 --> 58:10.420
I missed the marriage train

58:12.220 --> 58:14.740
To be honest.
I was never looking for that.

58:16.790 --> 58:18.820
It's difficult in my line of work.

58:18.990 --> 58:20.150
I travel a lot

58:21.460 --> 58:22.950
I'm like a sailor.

58:24.100 --> 58:25.860
a man in every port

58:31.440 --> 58:32.630
It's better that way

58:34.070 --> 58:36.010
I get the good part

58:36.140 --> 58:37.440
the compliments. The fun

58:39.150 --> 58:42.770
I don't get the jealousy
or the routine or the complaints.

58:45.420 --> 58:46.750
Do you see him often?

58:50.490 --> 58:51.460
Enough

58:54.630 --> 58:56.600
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to pry

58:56.760 --> 58:58.090
No. Don't worry.

59:01.770 --> 59:03.970
What bothers me is his lack of.

59:06.610 --> 59:08.440
He can never be on time

59:09.640 --> 59:12.110
I've been waiting for him for an hour

59:14.280 --> 59:15.940
I always have to wait.

59:19.120 --> 59:22.320
The king of waiting. I'm going to my room.

59:46.910 --> 59:47.880
Hello?

59:48.920 --> 59:49.880
Hello?

59:51.250 --> 59:52.220
Hello?

59:53.050 --> 59:54.020
Mario?

59:54.690 --> 59:55.660
Hello?

59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.190
Where are you?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.630
And why didn't you let me know earlier?

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.540
I've been waiting for you
for over an hour!

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:17.440
Do you recall that I cancelled
an appointment to see you?

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:23.150
No, I'm an idiot because I knew
you were going to do this to me.

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.720
Tonight?

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.550
Come off it, Mario.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.520
No. I've got tons of things to do.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:47.670
Are you sure you can make it?

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.470
What about Silvia?

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.110
No. You know what? I can't

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:00.280
I'm busy too

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.370
It's on the house.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.100
- No way.
- Please

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.370
Ok

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:25.780
Thanks

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.910
Another margarita?

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.350
- Ok.
- Coming up

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.730
Thanks

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:17.920
Open!

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.220
Fucking Mario!

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.830
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Miss

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:36.260
Please follow me

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.860
I'm not here for a room

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:39.620
I came to see the young man

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.430
- Young Sebastian?
- Yes.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.870
I'll let him know

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.030
Thank you.

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:16.800
I thought there would be
more clients at night.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.100
It depends on the day.

01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:22.410
But they are definitely ouder at night.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.970
I can imagine.

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:28.510
Hey...

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.380
what about going out for some fun?

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.120
- Right now?
- Sure!

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.860
I know a place that has a great vibes.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.460
It's on me.

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:47.920
Cheers.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.250
- Let's dance
- No.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.250
Come on.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.410
- Please.
- No. I don't dance.

01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:11.480
You should ask those pretty young girls

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.450
I'm sure they would be delighted.

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.620
- Come on...
- No.

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:16.320
Go on. Ask them.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.690
Ask them.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.860
I'll cheer you on from here

01:07:59.010 --> 01:07:59.840
The same

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.069
One tequila.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.479
Cheers.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:44.529
No. I don't want to leave.

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.770
Please, let's go.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.650
Where should I take you?

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:58.380
I love you. Mario

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:25.820
- What did you say your name was?
- Maria

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.290
The clotheslines are here
and the laundry is just beyond

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.630
The motel has ten rooms.
They're all similar.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.000
- We clean them as soon as they're vacant
- Ok

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.170
I'll show you one of the rooms

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:43.840
You always have to change
the sheets and towels

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.470
Put the soiled ones in the storage room

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:50.450
Lucha takes care of washing and ironing.

01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:52.680
What else?

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.720
Always leave
paper handkerchiefs next to the bed.

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:59.020
I'll show you where
the cleaning products are.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.850
If you run out, I'll buy more

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.030
- Any questions?
- No. Sir

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:09.000
The most important thing, Maria.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.100
is to be very discreet with the clients

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:14.860
Alright. Sir, don't worry

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.820
Here. Sir.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.660
I found this on the floor

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.470
- Where?
- Room number 10.

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:46.960
- Thank you
- You're welcome, Sir.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.210
Hey...

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.070
have you worked in a motel before?

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.480
No

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.810
Don't worry, it's very simple.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.280
Hardly anyone comes here anyway.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:45.760
The only trouble is when clients are drunk

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:48.500
and they make a mess in the rooms

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:55.400
And there's also the groups
that come in to have orgies

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.140
They leave a lot of work for us!

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:07.740
I'll be right back.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:17.380
I've come to apologize

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.220
I'm so embarrassed
I don't know what came over me.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.190
I even ruined your date.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.960
It wasn't anything

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:28.220
Of course it was

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.000
Did you get her phone number?

01:18:35.170 --> 01:18:37.470
I think it would have worked out well.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.070
I got really wasted,

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.150
I even lost my phone.

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:54.720
Thanks a lot!

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:59.190
I was so worried. I have many
important contacts and I didn't...

01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:01.600
What?

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.650
Look. A mermaid

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:40.630
That stain up there,

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.460
looks ike a mermaid.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:48.970
No

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:53.640
It looks more like...

01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.710
an iguana, doesn't it?

01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:59.380
An iguana?

01:21:00.650 --> 01:21:01.480
No way.

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:04.650
An iguana and a mermaid
have nothing in common.

01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:08.180
I can't see the mermaid

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:09.560
Come on.

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.520
Come over here to look at it

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:15.230
Come on.

01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:18.790
Look

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:21.370
Up there, see?

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.040
In the corner

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:30.420
No?

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.850
Down there, see it?

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.180
That thing

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.150
is the fish tail.

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:40.590
Then above

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:43.160
that's her hair

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:46.020
And those two spots are her tits

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:49.220
Got it now?

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:55.360
If that's a mermaid then I'm...

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:56.970
What?

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.410
A handsome stud like...

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.810
What? An iguana?

01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:28.130
Don't you have to get that?

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:32.040
No. The maid can go.

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:39.480
It doesn't sound as though she's going

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.890
Well. Have to get going anyway.

01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:31.860
Hello?

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.790
Maria? This is Sebastian,
from the Palma Real Motel

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.290
Are you coming in today? You're late

01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:43.100
Why? You and I had reached an agreement

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.100
Just tell your husband
it's a job like any other

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.400
I'm not shouting at you, I'm just saying

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.270
Hello?

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.310
Shit!

01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:11.200
How's tricks?

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.620
Why are you running off?

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.850
How much will you give me?

01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:35.930
One peso for each one

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.530
Oh yeah?

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:41.800
Better give me every
third coconut you bring down.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.540
- Yes or no?
- Ok.

01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:56.720
Watch your head. Dude.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.490
Send them down.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.120
Come on, I'll catch them down here

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.370
These are enough to set up my stand

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:31.710
What can I do for you?

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.840
We're here to deliver mattresses.

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.750
- I didn't order anything
- Look

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.550
The purchase was made

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.050
by Mr Gerardo Novoa Sanchez

01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:42.750
about a month ago.

01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.090
Address for delivery Palma Real Motel.

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:49.060
on KM 7 4 of the Nautla-Poza Rica road

01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:52.190
- Let me make a quick call
- Ok.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.560
How's it going?

01:32:53.730 --> 01:32:55.160
Move it, move it

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.990
And the old mattresses?

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.510
Ok

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:04.170
Ok. Don't worry.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.880
When wil the operation be over?

01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:12.480
Sign here. Please.

01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:14.550
Right here

01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:17.020
Thanks

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.050
Here's your invoice.

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.020
All set

01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:23.050
Bye. Thanks.

01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:32.500
- And the mattresses?
- We put them back there

01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:11.680
Good afternoon.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:15.410
I saw you were looking for a maid.

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.840
So I came in.

01:34:19.050 --> 01:34:20.750
Yes. Yes I am...

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.010
There are 10 rooms...

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.150
well 9 actually.

01:34:27.330 --> 01:34:29.990
They're all the same
So there isn't much to do.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.690
I've just received new mattresses,
that's why it's such a mess.

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.890
- Can I help you?
- No, don't worry

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:37.260
Why not? Come on

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.130
Ok. Thanks.

01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:45.240
Careful, it's a bit heavy

01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:56.080
- Thanks
- You're welcome.

01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:59.780
- I'll show you the rest of the motel.
- Ok.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.120
- After you
- Thanks

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:05.460
This is the reception.

01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:08.960
And that's the storage room
with the cleaning products

01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:10.620
My name is Sebastian

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.430
I'm in charge of my uncle's motel.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.540
- What's your name?
- Rosa

01:35:16.270 --> 01:35:17.760
Pleased to meet you Rosa

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.840
Well. What's important in this motel

01:35:21.450 --> 01:35:24.110
is to be very discreet with the clients

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.440
Yes, of course.

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:29.080
I'll show you another room.
