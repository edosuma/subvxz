00:00.031 --> 00:02.015
<i>Previously on</i> Roswell, New Mexico...

00:02.053 --> 00:03.552
<i>50 years after the incident,
I woke up in here.</i>

00:03.577 --> 00:06.689
<i>We had no memories or
rudimentary skills.</i>

00:06.714 --> 00:08.815
<i>I know my sister was
murdered by an alien.</i>

00:08.840 --> 00:11.181
I think there's a fourth
alien in Roswell.

00:11.206 --> 00:11.937
<i>It's Noah.</i>

00:11.962 --> 00:14.764
- Did you love Rosa Ortecho?
- Of course I did.

00:14.789 --> 00:16.322
<i>He's got Liz's serum coursing</i>

00:16.347 --> 00:17.420
<i>through his veins... It'll kill him.</i>

00:17.445 --> 00:19.277
<i>Some smoke bomb went off
in my jacket pocket.</i>

00:19.302 --> 00:20.961
This yellow powder is
rendering us powerless.

00:20.986 --> 00:22.335
Why do I know you?

00:22.360 --> 00:23.942
<i>- She's my...
- Your mother.</i>

00:23.975 --> 00:25.415
We have ten minutes to get
out of this building.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.285
Grab everything that you can.

00:26.310 --> 00:27.387
<i>Hard drives, anything.</i>

00:27.807 --> 00:30.027
Are you all capable of
electrostatic discharge,

00:30.052 --> 00:31.702
releasing energy intentionally?

00:31.727 --> 00:33.989
<i>If you can heal with
electricity, can you also harm?</i>

00:34.014 --> 00:35.128
<i>Kills make us stronger.</i>

00:35.153 --> 00:36.637
You could be strong

00:36.662 --> 00:37.471
if you weren't so afraid

00:37.496 --> 00:38.323
<i>of yourself.</i>

00:38.348 --> 00:39.704
<i>Destruction is power.</i>

00:39.729 --> 00:41.556
<i>You felt like a god.</i>

00:41.738 --> 00:43.216
Liz, give me the antidote.

00:43.241 --> 00:44.816
<i>This is the end of Noah's story.</i>

00:44.841 --> 00:46.226
Not until I get some answers.

00:46.251 --> 00:48.260
We need to get him the antidote.

00:48.285 --> 00:49.964
<i>- That's not gonna happen.
- This is how</i>

00:49.989 --> 00:51.851
it's gonna go, Max.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.643
<i>When I committed my life to science,</i>

00:56.668 --> 00:58.783
<i>I stopped believing in magic...</i>

00:59.451 --> 01:02.126
<i>in fairy tales with happy endings...</i>

01:02.576 --> 01:03.671
<i>in gods...</i>

01:04.763 --> 01:06.431
<i>and in ghosts.</i>

01:06.924 --> 01:08.857
<i>But then I met a demon,</i>

01:08.882 --> 01:12.077
<i>a creature who could
possess an innocent.</i>

01:13.442 --> 01:15.943
<i>So I can't help but ask:</i>

01:16.675 --> 01:18.697
<i>if the devil is real,</i>

01:18.873 --> 01:20.998
<i>what else walks amongst us?</i>

01:21.023 --> 01:22.389
Listen to me, Michael.

01:22.414 --> 01:24.183
There is nothing Noah has to say

01:24.208 --> 01:25.747
that is worth keeping him alive.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.573
I had a family, Max.

01:28.915 --> 01:30.481
I had a mother.

01:31.051 --> 01:32.516
I saw her.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.681
She's been a few miles away

01:34.706 --> 01:37.286
our whole lives at some
prison called Caulfield

01:37.311 --> 01:38.360
being tortured,

01:38.385 --> 01:40.746
- and we never knew.
- What? How...

01:40.771 --> 01:43.737
There are survivors
from the 1947 crash.

01:45.019 --> 01:47.606
There <i> were</i> survivors.

01:48.203 --> 01:49.870
They all just got flambéed

01:49.895 --> 01:52.615
on the order of Alex Manes's father.

01:53.490 --> 01:55.404
Listen, if there's any chance

01:55.429 --> 01:57.450
Noah knows anything about this, we...

01:57.943 --> 01:59.566
we have to take that chance.

01:59.591 --> 02:01.205
Think about what he did to Isobel.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.158
Whatever you saw out there,

02:03.183 --> 02:05.445
I am <i> so</i> sorry.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.864
But Noah is not the answer
you're looking for.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.473
No.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.407
He's not.

02:12.972 --> 02:15.926
My... my mom was.

02:16.717 --> 02:18.455
But he's all we got.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.172
Look, he's weak. He's weak.

02:21.197 --> 02:24.018
He'll never... be able to
stand up to both of us

02:24.043 --> 02:26.372
if we work together.

02:27.435 --> 02:28.961
We can...

02:29.733 --> 02:31.627
keep our guns on him.

02:31.937 --> 02:33.741
We give him the antidote...

02:34.243 --> 02:35.979
and we torture the
information out of him.

02:36.004 --> 02:37.336
It's too risky.

02:37.361 --> 02:38.143
We are minutes away

02:38.168 --> 02:39.929
from this guy being a bad memory.

02:41.212 --> 02:43.114
You're not gonna shoot me.

02:53.761 --> 02:57.013
He's the only chance we have
to know about our family.

02:57.038 --> 02:58.186
I know my family.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.830
You are my family!

03:00.372 --> 03:01.487
I am...

03:01.520 --> 03:03.799
so sorry, but I need him dead.

03:03.824 --> 03:05.981
I don't care what you need!

03:14.603 --> 03:16.389
Where's the antidote?

03:16.883 --> 03:19.187
I know you stole some from Liz's lab.

03:19.212 --> 03:20.190
In the cave,

03:20.604 --> 03:22.764
- with my pod.
- Let's go, then.

03:24.614 --> 03:26.445
Come on, get up.

03:27.434 --> 03:28.702
Let's go!

03:28.727 --> 03:29.978
Hey.

03:30.292 --> 03:31.646
Come on.

04:13.138 --> 04:14.581
Rough night?

04:14.948 --> 04:16.519
You need some tequila.

04:16.545 --> 04:17.810
I need you.

04:18.180 --> 04:20.866
Long day, and I am trying to forget

04:20.891 --> 04:23.698
everything about being an
adult for a little while.

04:23.723 --> 04:26.417
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

04:27.199 --> 04:28.398
Ooh.

04:28.423 --> 04:29.877
I always loved this.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.668
When did your mom give it to you?

04:31.693 --> 04:32.918
High school graduation.

04:32.943 --> 04:34.343
She took it off her neck,

04:34.368 --> 04:35.917
put it on mine.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.769
Do you know what this flower is?

04:40.794 --> 04:41.917
Mm-mm.

04:41.942 --> 04:42.902
It's rare.

04:42.927 --> 04:44.529
It only grows in one spot

04:44.554 --> 04:47.503
- in the Libyan desert.
- Weird.

04:48.004 --> 04:49.252
How do you know that?

04:49.277 --> 04:50.773
I found this yellow powder.

04:50.798 --> 04:53.375
I had a sample tested,
and it's a pollen.

04:54.389 --> 04:56.380
Uh, it's a long story.

04:56.405 --> 04:58.369
It's boring, science-y.

04:58.394 --> 05:00.799
Oh. It's a family heirloom.

05:00.824 --> 05:01.975
Mom always said

05:02.000 --> 05:03.837
it protected us from evil.

05:04.716 --> 05:06.199
Used to remind me of the long line

05:06.224 --> 05:08.127
of badass women I come from.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.530
Used to?

05:09.555 --> 05:12.136
Guerin fixed it, and
now it just reminds me

05:12.161 --> 05:13.319
of his stupid face,

05:13.344 --> 05:15.376
stupid voice, stupid hands...

05:15.401 --> 05:17.280
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

05:17.305 --> 05:19.579
- No. Oh, my God, you...
- Don't, don't, don't say it.

05:19.604 --> 05:20.942
It doesn't matter, because...

05:20.967 --> 05:22.833
Alex is in love with him, so...

05:23.225 --> 05:24.517
Yeah.

05:24.542 --> 05:27.106
Guerin is Alex's museum guy.

05:27.551 --> 05:28.638
That's a lot.

05:30.091 --> 05:31.140
That's a lot.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.998
Um...

05:34.031 --> 05:35.418
have you talked to Alex,

05:35.443 --> 05:36.815
told him how you feel?

05:36.840 --> 05:38.238
No, I just...

05:38.365 --> 05:39.921
I feel so guilty.

05:39.946 --> 05:43.256
Hey. You can't choose who you fall for.

05:43.695 --> 05:45.117
Love is scary.

05:45.142 --> 05:47.552
If we could choose, we
wouldn't fall at all, and...

05:48.194 --> 05:49.891
what's the fun in that?

05:51.132 --> 05:54.157
You can't be guilty of
something you can't control.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.588
Yeah.

06:00.237 --> 06:02.076
We agreed to go over the
Caulfield hard drives

06:02.101 --> 06:03.384
in the morning.

06:03.409 --> 06:05.738
Yeah, well, turns out I couldn't sleep.

06:05.763 --> 06:07.338
I thought I'd get a head start.

06:07.363 --> 06:09.988
There's security camera footage
on the drives I stole.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.713
That's Subject N-38.

06:12.738 --> 06:15.537
The alien that can give a
man stage IV brain cancer.

06:15.562 --> 06:17.370
The monster that killed your father.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.516
That's my father.

06:22.541 --> 06:24.215
He was pushed.

06:35.225 --> 06:36.843
And that...

06:36.868 --> 06:38.812
is the monster who killed him.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.949
Welcome back to town, sir.

06:48.974 --> 06:50.586
Master Sergeant.

06:51.137 --> 06:53.043
I'm sorry I failed you at Caulfield.

06:53.068 --> 06:55.049
Ah, we had our research backed up.

06:55.896 --> 06:57.590
We weren't keeping the bomb prototype

06:57.615 --> 06:58.818
on the premises anyway.

06:58.843 --> 07:01.610
Let's be honest, those specimens
weren't gonna last much longer.

07:02.326 --> 07:04.567
Now I'm more concerned about
the unwanted visitors

07:04.592 --> 07:06.262
who survived the Caulfield explosion.

07:06.287 --> 07:07.668
Unwanted visitors? It was Alex, Dad.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.748
What was I supposed to do?

07:12.658 --> 07:14.911
We'll handle your brother in due time.

07:15.199 --> 07:17.785
But first there's another
loose end I have to tie up.

07:18.065 --> 07:19.611
Valenti.

07:19.909 --> 07:21.175
You've reached Max Evans.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.410
Please leave a message.

07:22.435 --> 07:25.382
If this is an emergency,
please call 911.

07:25.407 --> 07:26.911
Max, hey.

07:26.936 --> 07:29.668
Uh, wanted to see if it's done.

07:29.693 --> 07:31.687
Uh, the handprint faded.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.586
I can't feel him anymore.

07:33.611 --> 07:35.632
Thought you might want to know.

07:36.445 --> 07:38.145
I'm coming back to your place.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.522
I'll bring food and...

07:40.263 --> 07:41.913

08:34.948 --> 08:36.772
She's hope and fire.

08:36.797 --> 08:39.058
I felt you through the handprint.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.716
You're jaded

08:40.741 --> 08:42.217

08:46.219 --> 08:48.810
Aw, come on, you know better.

08:52.383 --> 08:54.383
_

09:14.554 --> 09:15.890
Michael.

09:16.467 --> 09:17.804
Hey, bud.

09:17.829 --> 09:19.817
Come on, bud.

09:47.498 --> 09:49.743
Thought you were the smart sister.

10:19.187 --> 10:20.854
Max, what...?

10:20.879 --> 10:22.672
I tried to call.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.217
Michael will be fine.

10:25.242 --> 10:26.424
I healed him.

10:26.449 --> 10:28.586
We should get out of
here before he wakes up.

10:28.611 --> 10:30.511
I'll explain in the car.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.219
What?

10:32.244 --> 10:33.589
Let's go.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.844
- Max.
- Liz. Thank God.

10:42.869 --> 10:43.801
Are you okay?

10:43.826 --> 10:44.815
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.360
Noah's on the loose.

10:46.385 --> 10:47.580
No.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.440
He's not, actually. I
have him in my freezer.

10:49.654 --> 10:50.899
I dosed him

10:50.924 --> 10:52.373
with the pollen, but
I didn't have much.

10:52.398 --> 10:53.803
I don't know how long
it's gonna last, Max.

10:54.838 --> 10:56.701
This won't end well for you!

10:56.726 --> 10:59.174
You just put a lion in a paper cage!

10:59.199 --> 11:00.481
Okay, Isobel and I are on our way.

11:00.506 --> 11:01.651
Get out of there.

11:01.676 --> 11:04.037
I'm not leaving. If he gets out,

11:04.062 --> 11:05.957
we need to stop him
before he kills someone.

11:05.982 --> 11:07.590
Liz, go.

11:09.987 --> 11:12.216
Just get here.

11:17.384 --> 11:19.797
What are you gonna do when your
imbecile father comes down

11:19.822 --> 11:21.677
for breakfast in the morning, huh?

11:21.702 --> 11:23.894
I'll fry him like bacon.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.103
Rosa loved her family.

11:27.614 --> 11:29.383
She would be disgusted by you.

11:29.408 --> 11:31.008
You didn't deserve to know her.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.944
<i>You</i> don't know her.

11:33.576 --> 11:35.139
She didn't tell you her secrets, Liz.

11:35.164 --> 11:36.423
She told me.

11:36.784 --> 11:38.296
It's true, Liz.

11:38.516 --> 11:40.337
You know she made your mother leave?

11:40.829 --> 11:42.741
She told her never to come back

11:42.766 --> 11:44.817
or she'd tell you and Arturo the truth.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.524
What truth?

11:46.965 --> 11:48.896
About her father.

11:49.369 --> 11:52.261
Rosa isn't Arturo Ortecho's daughter.

11:54.037 --> 11:55.623
Your mother knew it, too.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.842
- She knew all along...
- Shut up!

11:57.867 --> 12:00.600
That Rosa is a Valenti.

12:01.826 --> 12:03.497
Would you look at that?

12:05.478 --> 12:07.045
Wore off quick.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.892
Rosa isn't yours, Liz.

12:10.278 --> 12:12.459
She's mine.

12:12.827 --> 12:15.349
She will always be mine.

12:25.350 --> 12:28.263
Liz.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.973
He got out.

12:30.273 --> 12:31.728
I'm coming to you.

12:31.753 --> 12:33.086
No, I-I'm fine.

12:33.111 --> 12:35.048
Noah needs to kill to
regain his strength.

12:35.073 --> 12:36.909
Somebody will die if you
don't stop him now.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.634
I think I know where he might be.

12:41.095 --> 12:43.329
Call it a loving wife's intuition.

12:44.065 --> 12:45.944
Are you sure you're okay, Liz?

12:45.969 --> 12:47.771
Yes. I'm fine.

12:48.488 --> 12:49.887
Okay.

12:50.724 --> 12:51.902
Max.

12:51.927 --> 12:53.126
Yeah.

12:54.859 --> 12:56.988
Stay safe.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.904
Watch it.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.324
I'm sorry.

13:18.349 --> 13:20.599
Folks don't look where they're
going where you're from?

13:23.951 --> 13:25.767
Where do you think that is?

13:25.792 --> 13:27.398
Just curious.

13:27.423 --> 13:29.155
Mexico?

13:47.358 --> 13:49.315
Sorry it took me so long.

13:49.548 --> 13:51.941
I swear I was being followed.
I had to lose the guy.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.031
Tonight's been hell.

13:55.062 --> 13:56.830
Liz?

13:58.888 --> 14:00.274
Noah.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.662
- Needle and thread.
- Uh, linen closet upstairs.

14:02.687 --> 14:05.961
My mom's old kit. Kyle,
don't wake my dad.

14:19.518 --> 14:21.677
How'd you know he was here?

14:22.240 --> 14:23.582
Iz.

14:23.607 --> 14:24.891
Please stay in the car.

14:25.923 --> 14:28.250
Maximo, what took you so long?

14:29.187 --> 14:31.738
Isobel. Iso... Stop.

14:34.466 --> 14:37.704
Isobel can't come to
the phone right now.

14:40.271 --> 14:41.598
Neat trick, huh?

14:41.623 --> 14:43.123
You made her bring me here.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.591
She was traumatized,

14:44.616 --> 14:46.500
so I snuck into her beautiful mind.

14:51.029 --> 14:53.271
You're fast, cowboy, but I'm faster.

14:53.296 --> 14:54.520
See, if you practiced,

14:54.545 --> 14:56.205
you'd be better at this.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.466
What are you doing to me?

15:00.646 --> 15:02.429
Tying your intestines in a knot.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.931
Hurts, doesn't it?

15:07.956 --> 15:11.014
The whole duel to the
death at high noon thing

15:11.039 --> 15:13.608
is fun, man, but any
redneck can work a gun.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.087
I prefer to get creative.

15:19.255 --> 15:20.850
We should be at the hospital.

15:20.875 --> 15:23.045
They'd make me answer
too many questions.

15:23.070 --> 15:25.738
Mm-mm. I'm fine. We don't
have time for all that.

15:25.763 --> 15:29.101
All that anesthesia. Those
sanitary instruments.

15:29.744 --> 15:31.980
He said I didn't know Rosa.

15:33.949 --> 15:36.259
He said she was your father's daughter.

15:37.255 --> 15:38.887
And that she died

15:38.912 --> 15:40.997
knowing that, and she never told me.

15:43.690 --> 15:45.461
M-Maybe...

15:45.934 --> 15:48.571
she just couldn't find the right time.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.905
You knew?

15:58.767 --> 16:01.128
You lost a sister, too.

16:05.366 --> 16:06.926
What happened?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.828
I'm fine. It's not my blood.

16:09.853 --> 16:10.928
What are you doing here?

16:11.398 --> 16:13.960
I... I wanted to see you.

16:13.985 --> 16:16.009
Alex, it's a really bad time.

16:16.034 --> 16:18.041
O-Okay.

16:18.736 --> 16:20.436
Look...

16:21.340 --> 16:23.051
I shouldn't have left you behind

16:23.076 --> 16:24.916
when I enlisted.

16:27.796 --> 16:29.568
I could... I could stand
here and tell you

16:29.593 --> 16:31.663
that I didn't want to leave, but I did.

16:31.984 --> 16:34.503
After what my dad did
to you, I just, I...

16:35.215 --> 16:38.069
I wanted to be the kind of
person who won battles.

16:39.021 --> 16:40.648
It felt good.

16:41.974 --> 16:44.050
But now I-I look in the mirror,

16:44.944 --> 16:48.578
and I-I don't even see
myself sometimes.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.499
I see my father.

16:52.256 --> 16:54.316
I'm still fighting his battles.

16:55.062 --> 16:56.926
Not mine.

17:02.774 --> 17:03.845
<i>You're gonna die.</i>

17:07.622 --> 17:08.864
I have to go.

17:08.888 --> 17:10.896
I have to go. I have to go.

17:10.921 --> 17:14.410
Come back tomorrow. We can talk then.

17:21.323 --> 17:22.678
Isobel.

17:25.329 --> 17:27.291
She won't wake up for a while.

17:27.317 --> 17:29.365
It's hard on her body, being inhabited.

17:29.752 --> 17:33.038
But she likes it rough sometimes.

17:33.063 --> 17:35.062
I am going to kill you.

17:39.968 --> 17:41.968
Why are you keeping us alive?

17:42.254 --> 17:43.379
Huh?

17:43.404 --> 17:45.184
What are you leveraging us for?

17:45.209 --> 17:46.820
The alighting.

17:47.974 --> 17:50.182
They're coming for us, Maximo.

17:50.525 --> 17:52.860
I'd hoped we could go
as a family, but...

17:54.912 --> 17:57.280
- plans change.
- What's the alighting?

17:57.305 --> 17:59.694
- Who are they?
- I told you when we left.

17:59.719 --> 18:01.749
Our home was ravaged by war.

18:02.669 --> 18:04.608
They are the ones who were victorious.

18:04.633 --> 18:05.881
Whichever side won,

18:05.906 --> 18:07.801
they'd never just leave us here.

18:07.826 --> 18:10.952
Well... they'd never leave <i> you</i> here.

18:13.942 --> 18:15.322
Why me?

18:15.456 --> 18:16.802
What do they want with me?

18:17.541 --> 18:19.459
You're the savior.

18:21.521 --> 18:22.993
Now that you're all grown up,

18:23.018 --> 18:25.027
they'll come. Maybe not this year

18:25.052 --> 18:27.733
or the next, but it doesn't matter.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.160
I've had my fun with the three of you.

18:30.185 --> 18:32.795
Now it's time to put you back
in the pods so when they come,

18:32.820 --> 18:34.856
I'll be waiting to trade
you for a ride home.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.313
You got it all wrong.

18:36.689 --> 18:38.289
I'm no savior.

18:38.314 --> 18:41.162
You have no idea what
you're capable of.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.371
You're like a human.

18:43.396 --> 18:45.233
Using a tiny percentage
of your potential,

18:45.258 --> 18:48.256
believing you only have
one kind of power.

18:48.281 --> 18:50.184
Unlock your mind,

18:50.209 --> 18:51.638
and you could be a god.

18:51.663 --> 18:54.435
No. I'm not.

18:56.062 --> 18:58.358
Come on! All those books,

18:58.383 --> 18:59.787
and you haven't figured religion out?

18:59.812 --> 19:02.372
You haven't guessed who those
stories are really about?

19:02.397 --> 19:04.716
Strange creatures with
familiar features

19:04.741 --> 19:06.921
coming down from the heavens.

19:06.963 --> 19:08.563
Parting the seas.

19:08.588 --> 19:12.155
Striking people down
with bolts of lightning.

19:17.617 --> 19:19.514
You're having a heart attack.

19:19.539 --> 19:20.764
When they come for you,

19:20.789 --> 19:22.124
they'll want you alive.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.652
But barely will do.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.741
Are you okay?

19:31.766 --> 19:34.372
I'm not... I'm not strong enough.

19:40.249 --> 19:42.317
Hold him off, Michael.

20:26.352 --> 20:28.711
We are Ophiuchus, Max.

20:29.499 --> 20:32.940
The man and the serpent,
the serpent and the man.

20:33.158 --> 20:35.138
They're not killing each other.

20:35.163 --> 20:36.892
They are one!

20:54.789 --> 20:56.330
Max!

21:22.224 --> 21:24.001
It's over, isn't it?

21:24.610 --> 21:26.259
Yes.

21:27.398 --> 21:29.847
I just had one last
thing to say to you.

21:32.864 --> 21:35.530
You're not my person, Noah.

21:35.555 --> 21:38.293
That's why I never wanted
to tell you my secret.

21:41.247 --> 21:43.158
I don't love you.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.365
I never did.

21:57.470 --> 21:59.681
Take care of her, Isobel.

22:47.978 --> 22:51.133
Rifle? Semiautomatic pistol?

22:51.158 --> 22:52.961
I just want a gun.

22:52.986 --> 22:54.861
$249.99.

22:57.192 --> 22:58.806
No background check?

22:58.831 --> 23:02.130
Where do you think you
are, son, California?

23:03.527 --> 23:05.050
You hit your head or something?

23:05.075 --> 23:06.866
You look messed up.

23:08.093 --> 23:10.723
I'm not the kind of guy who buys a gun.

23:11.230 --> 23:12.733
A few months ago I was a surgeon

23:12.758 --> 23:14.545
on my way to my high school reunion,

23:14.570 --> 23:16.280
and now I got a dead sister

23:16.305 --> 23:19.008
and a dad who was killed
by his closest friend.

23:20.515 --> 23:22.777
And... by the way, I have this feeling

23:22.802 --> 23:24.529
that guy's following me,

23:24.584 --> 23:26.453
even though he's in friggin' Africa.

23:26.478 --> 23:29.392
So I'm... losing it.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.951
You know...

23:31.976 --> 23:34.031
I used to be a real dick.

23:35.234 --> 23:39.240
And then my dad died, and I
started living by his code.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.868
But it turns out being a
good person doesn't matter.

23:43.718 --> 23:46.692
Do no harm, they say.

23:46.984 --> 23:48.411
And then the world's on fire

23:48.436 --> 23:49.848
and you're sitting there
with your thumb up your ass

23:49.873 --> 23:51.903
because you don't want to do damage.

23:52.416 --> 23:54.399
So I'm done...

23:54.424 --> 23:55.981
with the code.

23:56.282 --> 23:57.664
Screw the code.

23:57.689 --> 24:00.334
Look, it's late, and you're
obviously in a bad way.

24:00.359 --> 24:02.294
Look, so you won't... sell me the gun?

24:02.319 --> 24:05.451
My friend, it is your God-given
right as an American citizen

24:05.476 --> 24:07.239
to protect yourself.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.036
It's just, uh, I can knock off

24:10.061 --> 24:12.815
25 bucks for the "family
and friends" deal,

24:12.840 --> 24:15.222
'cause I'm sympathetic to your plight.

24:20.737 --> 24:23.080
I got into his head...

24:23.519 --> 24:25.118
right before he died.

24:25.143 --> 24:26.698
What?

24:27.084 --> 24:28.350
Why?

24:28.674 --> 24:30.209
I had to tell him something.

24:30.234 --> 24:32.887
All you've wanted for years
was to be honest with him.

24:33.229 --> 24:36.159
At least you were, in the end.
That's a good thing, Iz.

24:37.537 --> 24:40.009
I told him I never loved him.

24:41.386 --> 24:44.678
So the last thing I ever
said to him was a lie.

24:46.862 --> 24:48.591
He said something to me, though.

24:48.616 --> 24:50.641
"Take care of her."

24:52.259 --> 24:54.504
It doesn't make any sense.

24:55.248 --> 24:57.225
A lot of answers died with Noah.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.783
And a lot of evil. I mean,
come on, guys, this is a win.

24:59.808 --> 25:01.646
We don't need his answers.
Why you're here doesn't have

25:01.671 --> 25:03.321
anything to do with our
past or where we come from.

25:03.346 --> 25:05.524
Why you're here is about our future.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.965
Quit looking in your
rearview mirror, Michael.

25:11.513 --> 25:12.663
What are you doing?

25:12.688 --> 25:13.891
You don't need to live in the past.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.212
No, no, don't, no.

25:15.237 --> 25:16.066
Please!

25:16.091 --> 25:17.534
You don't need the pain

25:17.559 --> 25:19.210
to remind you of who you are.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.503
Max,

25:37.528 --> 25:39.268
people-people-people will notice.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.224
This is Roswell.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.207
Max?

25:55.106 --> 25:56.458
Max!

25:57.363 --> 25:58.795
Max?

25:58.820 --> 26:00.726
Liz?

26:17.302 --> 26:19.526
LIZ: Oh!

26:26.194 --> 26:27.599
It's okay. It's done, he's gone,

26:27.624 --> 26:28.951
and he's not coming back.

26:28.976 --> 26:30.818
Are you okay?

26:33.427 --> 26:35.366
I'm better than I have been

26:35.391 --> 26:37.447
in a long time.

26:51.087 --> 26:52.620
What...?

26:54.758 --> 26:56.013
It's okay.

26:56.037 --> 26:57.306
- Liz...
- I'm fine.

26:57.331 --> 26:58.829
Nothing hurts. Please don't stop.

27:24.970 --> 27:26.480
What are you doing?

27:26.818 --> 27:28.281
Do it.

27:28.306 --> 27:30.235
- No. I shouldn't...
- Please.

27:32.614 --> 27:35.278
I want you to feel what I feel for you.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.213
Echoes.

27:37.730 --> 27:39.572
Everything.

28:01.872 --> 28:03.831
He must have a secret
hideout somewhere.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.986
He told you he was hiding
more antidote in a cave.

28:06.011 --> 28:08.022
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

28:08.047 --> 28:09.546
He was the only person I ever loved.

28:09.571 --> 28:11.275
What does that say about me?

28:12.098 --> 28:13.391
Nothing.

28:14.707 --> 28:16.877
We're defined by what we can control.

28:17.416 --> 28:19.091
Love is out of control.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.395
Love is the worst thing
that ever happened to me,

28:20.420 --> 28:23.204
and I was in a... spaceship crash.

28:24.544 --> 28:25.812
You know...

28:25.837 --> 28:28.085
you never want to talk
about Alex Manes,

28:28.110 --> 28:30.139
but... you do realize

28:30.164 --> 28:31.867
that my romantic troubles

28:31.892 --> 28:35.209
now officially trump your
flimsy little closet, right?

28:37.968 --> 28:39.411
He knows everything.

28:39.436 --> 28:41.111
His family is involved
in the conspiracy

28:41.136 --> 28:43.110
that tortured and killed
the other aliens.

28:43.135 --> 28:44.072
He's tangled up in all

28:44.097 --> 28:46.269
these terrible memories
in my life, and...

28:47.913 --> 28:49.862
I love him.

28:51.302 --> 28:52.966
I probably always will.

28:52.991 --> 28:55.125
But lately that love just hurts.

28:55.586 --> 28:58.929
Coming back to him, it always
feels like a crash landing.

29:01.330 --> 29:03.264
Maybe Max is right.

29:03.336 --> 29:05.706
Maybe it's time we stop
looking back and...

29:05.856 --> 29:07.733
start looking forward.

29:12.071 --> 29:13.963
Hey.

29:32.957 --> 29:34.818
That's Noah's pod.

29:45.804 --> 29:47.137
Oh...

29:57.094 --> 29:58.767
Rosa.

30:07.198 --> 30:09.365
All right, I get it.

30:09.390 --> 30:11.135
Now that you've had me,
the mystery's gone.

30:12.246 --> 30:14.617
And you're just gonna
take off and leave me

30:14.642 --> 30:16.676
- Mm.
- Utterly debauched

30:16.701 --> 30:18.144
and entirely alone.

30:18.169 --> 30:19.541
Mm, you got me.

30:19.566 --> 30:21.709
This whole time I was just
trying to get into your pants.

30:21.734 --> 30:23.363
It was the uniform, frankly.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.182
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.160
Stay.

30:32.057 --> 30:34.455
- That's yours.
- Isobel?

30:36.345 --> 30:38.345
_

30:38.964 --> 30:41.424
She's been through a nightmare, Max.

30:43.044 --> 30:44.517
Go see your sister.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.542
And I'm going to see mine.

30:50.010 --> 30:51.415
I can come with you.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.873
No.

30:53.522 --> 30:55.348
I got to go on my own.

30:57.019 --> 30:59.340
You know, I always...

30:59.365 --> 31:01.665
thought if I had all the answers,

31:01.974 --> 31:03.821
I would feel better, but...

31:04.537 --> 31:07.451
somehow now that the mystery is solved,

31:07.476 --> 31:11.099
that the villain is vanquished
and that it's all really over...

31:13.533 --> 31:15.725
she feels even more gone.

31:19.394 --> 31:21.150
I just...

31:21.485 --> 31:23.994
I got to get used to this
whole new kind of grief.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.699
And I got to do that on my own.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.698
I knew you were gonna...

31:47.598 --> 31:49.893
Say hello to Jim for me, son.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.906
Bulletproof vest, huh?

32:19.527 --> 32:21.059
Nicely done.

32:21.084 --> 32:25.333
I wanted to buy a gun...
but I couldn't do it.

32:26.058 --> 32:27.975
I'm not like you.

32:28.861 --> 32:30.271
I'm not a killer.

32:30.598 --> 32:34.817
Oh, so you... you know about your dad.

32:36.218 --> 32:38.754
An alien killed his daughter,

32:39.181 --> 32:41.227
and he still wanted to
shut Caulfield down.

32:41.252 --> 32:43.704
The alien that killed Rosa
wasn't in your torture chamber.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.412
You tried to cover up the kills.

32:45.437 --> 32:47.602
And your dad conducted the cover-ups.

32:47.627 --> 32:49.537
I wanted them exposed.

32:50.393 --> 32:53.276
I wanted the American people to arm...

32:53.301 --> 32:54.876
Ah!

33:00.166 --> 33:01.599
Barbiturates.

33:01.624 --> 33:03.788
You're about to enter a
medically-induced coma,

33:03.813 --> 33:05.145
Master Sergeant.

33:05.170 --> 33:06.594
Don't worry.

33:06.619 --> 33:07.873
I'll get you to the hospital

33:07.898 --> 33:10.610
before any of your vital
organs shut down.

33:13.012 --> 33:15.960
I hope your doctor's
a real man of honor.

33:16.784 --> 33:18.784
Someone with a code.

33:18.896 --> 33:22.168
Though, I suppose, it depends on
what their version of honor is.

33:22.193 --> 33:25.772
One nation's soldier is
another's terrorist.

33:28.984 --> 33:32.630
Isn't that right, Master Sergeant?

33:39.479 --> 33:41.938
He's had her here all this time?

33:41.963 --> 33:43.263
How?

33:43.389 --> 33:44.732
Dug her up, maybe?

33:44.912 --> 33:46.414
Or body-snatched someone

33:46.439 --> 33:48.193
who works at the morgue,
made them deliver her fresh.

33:48.218 --> 33:50.159
- Does it matter?
- I-I need to call Liz.

33:50.184 --> 33:52.530
And tell her what, exactly?
That all this time,

33:52.555 --> 33:55.394
Rosa's been some naked,
burned-up trophy on display?

33:55.419 --> 33:57.780
Maybe we don't put it like that.

33:57.805 --> 33:59.741
I can't keep this secret from her.

34:00.188 --> 34:03.415
This will haunt her nightmares.

34:04.234 --> 34:06.289
What if...?

34:10.103 --> 34:12.556
How long do you think she was
dead before he put her in there?

34:12.581 --> 34:14.368
Max, you tried to save
her ten years ago.

34:14.393 --> 34:16.827
What-what if we're only using
a-a piece of our potential?

34:16.851 --> 34:18.664
What if we could unlock more?

34:18.920 --> 34:20.409
You mean, like different powers?

34:20.434 --> 34:22.880
Or stronger ones; Noah was
more powerful than us.

34:22.905 --> 34:24.228
Stop!

34:25.657 --> 34:27.991
You can't resurrect a girl
that's been dead a decade.

34:28.020 --> 34:30.739
We can't undo the past.

34:31.054 --> 34:33.585
We can make a plan, once things settle,

34:33.610 --> 34:34.840
to give Rosa a proper burial,

34:34.864 --> 34:38.409
once we-we take the
time to just be normal.

34:40.290 --> 34:42.056

Yeah.

We will.

36:05.417 --> 36:09.227
Uh, first, you... you mind if I...?

36:10.706 --> 36:12.383
Sure.

36:46.959 --> 36:49.705
If you can, uh, hear me...

36:51.365 --> 36:53.147
you probably know I don't believe

36:53.172 --> 36:54.875
you can actually hear me.

36:55.486 --> 36:58.501
And I think I'm an idiot
for talking to a rock.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.926
But you believed in something.

37:06.006 --> 37:09.217
You believed in a God who put
a cage around your heart

37:09.242 --> 37:12.405
to protect it, so here I am.

37:15.540 --> 37:17.876
<i>I'm in love with Max Evans.</i>

37:18.163 --> 37:19.778
<i>I never said it.</i>

37:21.907 --> 37:25.904
<i>Probably 'cause a tiny
17-year-old piece of me</i>

37:26.017 --> 37:28.311
<i>thought you might hear it.</i>

37:29.185 --> 37:31.263
I haven't forgotten what he did to you.

37:32.255 --> 37:35.942
And I felt so guilty...

37:36.652 --> 37:38.733
for loving him.

37:40.341 --> 37:44.790
But I do... love him.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.529
And he loves me.

37:50.905 --> 37:53.651
<i>I wish you had the chance</i>

37:53.676 --> 37:55.865
<i>to have someone love you,</i>

37:55.890 --> 37:59.491
<i>Rosa, purely,</i>

37:59.516 --> 38:03.713
<i>without expectation or entitlement.</i>

38:10.688 --> 38:12.735
I wish you had time to let...

38:12.760 --> 38:14.784
your heart out of its cage.

38:17.051 --> 38:19.601
And I wish... Oh...

38:19.626 --> 38:23.711
Ah, I wish I could just... call you,

38:23.944 --> 38:26.628
and tell you everything, but...

38:32.545 --> 38:33.693
Max.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.944
Max.

40:07.395 --> 40:08.887
Max!

40:09.476 --> 40:11.334
Liz?

40:46.204 --> 40:48.706
How...? I-I... I don't understand.

40:48.731 --> 40:49.789
Oh...

40:49.814 --> 40:51.754
Don't be afraid.

40:51.779 --> 40:53.301
I'm here. Okay?

40:53.326 --> 40:55.530
I'm here. It's gonna be okay.

41:05.398 --> 41:08.049
Rosa, where's Max?

41:16.484 --> 41:17.523
Max.

41:17.548 --> 41:19.274
Hey, Max.

41:20.028 --> 41:21.881
Wake up.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.433
♪ I can't breathe ♪

41:26.767 --> 41:29.981
