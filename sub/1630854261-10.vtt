18:41.685 --> 18:43.383
I can't believe
you right now.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.689
Hold up, Keish.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.648
Look, there's a bigger
picture you ain't seeing.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.781
You didn't just
blow up at Dr. P.
or the president.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.261
OK. What, she
has another job

18:52.305 --> 18:54.220
that I
don't know about?

18:54.263 --> 18:55.351
You remember
how you thought

18:55.395 --> 18:56.961
your dad was
seeing somebody?

18:57.005 --> 18:59.312
Yeah, but it cooled
down a little bit.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.488
Are you trying to
say that they're--

19:01.531 --> 19:03.142
I didn't put it together
until your dad

19:03.185 --> 19:04.578
called the office today.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.928
Start of semester,
Dr. P. was acting

19:06.971 --> 19:08.625
a whole lot
like your dad--

19:08.669 --> 19:10.410
goofy smiles
while texting,

19:10.453 --> 19:11.976
whispered
phone calls.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.195
OK, but that doesn't
mean that they're dating.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.675
Don't mean
they're not.

19:16.807 --> 19:20.507
Amara: Yes, athletics
delivers revenue,

19:20.550 --> 19:23.814
but this building
could be a resource

19:23.858 --> 19:26.643
to other departments
in need of space.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.297
This isn't
them versus us.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.473
It's a chance
to work together

19:30.517 --> 19:33.650
to serve the needs
of the entire student body.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.304
Trustee: Thank you,
Dr. Patterson,

19:35.348 --> 19:37.524
for your thoughtful
presentation.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.659
Coach Marcus, I would love
to hear your take on this.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.270
As I understand it,
the reason Bringston

19:44.313 --> 19:46.663
can afford this property
is because your team

19:46.707 --> 19:48.404
generated
the revenue it did

19:48.448 --> 19:50.189
for the
pay-to-play game.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.668
[Clears throat]

19:51.712 --> 19:53.714
Well, athletics is the
lifeblood here at Bringston.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.542
Our athletes
deserve a facility

19:55.585 --> 19:57.674
that will help
them achieve

19:57.718 --> 19:59.633
at their
highest level.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.548
New facilities will
attract elite players,

20:01.591 --> 20:03.506
which, in turn,
will increase our stature

20:03.550 --> 20:06.901
as a program
and revenues,

20:06.944 --> 20:09.817
so that's
my two cents.

20:09.860 --> 20:11.645
Thank you.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.446
[Jessie speaking indistinctly]

20:30.490 --> 20:32.622
Jessie: ...can't hear anything
I'm saying to you.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.887
Jessie: Dad, how could you
undermine me with my son?

20:36.931 --> 20:39.325
Jessie, your
relationship with J.R.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.718
was already broken.

20:41.762 --> 20:44.243
I guess that's why
it always falls to me

20:44.286 --> 20:45.722
to do what
has to be done.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.942
What are you
talking about now?

20:47.985 --> 20:50.640
Grandpa: I'm sorry.
Of course. You don't see it.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.903
I'm gonna tell him
he has to break up

20:52.947 --> 20:55.602
with that fast girl
before it's too late.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.344
What? Dad, no. Just stay
out of J.R.'s business.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.650
I have always
protected J.R.,

21:00.694 --> 21:02.261
and I'm not
gonna stop now.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.566
If you're so
concerned with J.R.,

21:03.610 --> 21:05.264
why support him
with Cape Cod?

21:05.307 --> 21:07.091
If I'd have come to you
with something like this,

21:07.135 --> 21:08.745
you would've
forbade it.

21:08.789 --> 21:12.445
Son, if you
had shown hustle

21:12.488 --> 21:15.317
about anything
in your life,

21:15.361 --> 21:17.188
I would've
backed you,

21:17.232 --> 21:20.540
but that's not you,
is it, son?

21:20.583 --> 21:23.412
You let everyone
walk all over you,

21:23.456 --> 21:25.893
even your wife.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.422
We answered
the clues.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.902
Why isn't
the door opening?

21:34.945 --> 21:36.599
I don't know.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.819
Clearly, we're
missing something.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.865
[Ringtone]

21:41.909 --> 21:44.607
Maybe you
should answer that.

21:44.651 --> 21:48.307
Could be Damon's mom
calling again.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.786
Girl, Keena called
to check and see

21:49.830 --> 21:52.485
how Damon
was holding up.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.487
She's worried
about him.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.271
Well, in that case,
why not call me?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.838
I used to date
him, not you.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.622
Exactly.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.798
You broke
her son's heart.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.801
Plus, she probably didn't
want to make things awkward.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.716
[Exhales]

22:06.760 --> 22:09.893
That does
make sense.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.069
How is he?

22:12.113 --> 22:13.941
Well, last
I talked to him,

22:13.984 --> 22:15.377
he said he's good.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.988
I don't
believe him, but--

22:18.032 --> 22:21.340
You haven't checked
on him yourself?

22:22.428 --> 22:24.560
No. I--

22:24.604 --> 22:26.736
I was just
getting the hang

22:26.780 --> 22:28.825
of the, like,
girlfriend thing.

22:28.869 --> 22:32.307
I--I don't know
how to be the ex.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.049
You start by
being his friend.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.356
His dad
passed away,

22:37.399 --> 22:38.792
so put your
feelings aside

22:38.835 --> 22:41.882
and just show up,
period.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.840
OK.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.842
Your bedside manner
used to be better.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.322
I'm sorry.

I'm stuck in
an escape room

if you'll excuse me.

the last clue?

planks over there.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.566
Hmm.

I mean, it's just
a broken board,

that symbol.

have to say?

and you helped them.

have a choice, Amara.

what I believe

don't save myself

of what's right.

want to tell him.

repeat itself.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.268
Damon: Well, what is
that supposed to mean?

28:25.312 --> 28:26.879
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

28:26.922 --> 28:29.969
Jessie got too serious
too fast with Celine,

28:30.012 --> 28:33.233
who, as we know,
ended up cheating on him

28:33.276 --> 28:36.453
and then had what
we thought at the time

28:36.497 --> 28:38.020
was another
man's child,

28:38.064 --> 28:40.762
and then she--
she convinced Jessie

28:40.806 --> 28:43.199
to raise that child
for over a year.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.375
Uh, Mr. Raymond,
I'm gonna need you

28:45.419 --> 28:47.595
to stop referring to
me as "that child"

28:47.638 --> 28:49.728
because I'm
standing right here.

28:49.771 --> 28:54.515
Son, I don't know
who raised you,

28:54.558 --> 28:55.951
but in this family,

28:55.995 --> 28:58.301
you don't talk back
to your elders.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.434
You do when
they deserve it.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.221
Dad, I let you bully
me my whole life.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.354
I won't let you
do it to my boys.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.443
Grandpa:
Your boys?

29:09.486 --> 29:12.751
Now, there never would
have been a question

29:12.794 --> 29:14.317
Damon is yours
had Celine

29:14.361 --> 29:16.798
simply remained
faithful, right?

29:16.842 --> 29:20.715
J.R.: Gramps, did you tell my
dad to break it off with my mom?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.195
I was protecting
my son.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.066
OK, and in
protecting your son,

29:24.110 --> 29:26.460
did that also include
telling him to give Damon away?

29:28.636 --> 29:30.899
I didn't have
to say anything.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.814
Jessie knew
I wasn't raising him

29:32.858 --> 29:36.426
to be a weak man,
right, boy?

29:36.470 --> 29:39.647
Yo, J., um, let's get
out of here, man.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.257
J.R.: Yeah.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.912
This ain't how I planned
on spending my day anyway.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.610
Hey, grandson,
wait a minute.

at the escape room.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.272
They did, though.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.274
We just had to use
them differently.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.493
We need to play into our
strengths as singles players

30:43.537 --> 30:47.106
and minimize our weaknesses
as a doubles team.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.456

was foul.

If we're gonna be
in a real relationship,

32:09.449 --> 32:11.886
we got to be able to check
each other when necessary.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.409
No. I know,
and that's why

32:13.453 --> 32:15.542
I wanted to say
I'm sorry.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.370
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

32:20.851 --> 32:23.854
Why you do all this? My plan
was to stay mad at you.

32:23.898 --> 32:27.162
Mm. Yeah. Well,
good luck with that.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.208
What's all this?

32:29.251 --> 32:32.646
It's for the next stop
on my apology tour.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.214
[Both chuckle]

32:38.521 --> 32:40.436
How you feeling?

32:40.480 --> 32:43.874
Like my world
is right side up.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.615
You and Gabby
saw Gramps,

32:45.659 --> 32:48.096
like, really saw him.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.534
Just crazy I got him
wrong for so long.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.015
Look, I know what
it's like to learn

32:54.059 --> 32:55.451
the dude who you
respected the most

32:55.495 --> 32:57.323
isn't who you
thought he was.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.240
You're not
alone, bro.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.372
I don't mean
to interrupt.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.462
We have a tradition
to uphold.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.988
Why are there
only 10?

33:10.031 --> 33:13.121
One for each year
of my remission.

33:13.165 --> 33:15.776
Every year,
we add another one.

33:15.819 --> 33:19.345
These cupcakes are also
a peace offering.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.305
J.R., I realize that
I've treated you

33:23.349 --> 33:25.133
the same way your
grandfather treated me

33:25.177 --> 33:28.484
all these years, trying
to control your life,

33:28.528 --> 33:31.139
not supporting
your dreams.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.315
That stops today.

33:33.359 --> 33:37.928
I'm sorry,
so moving forward,

33:37.972 --> 33:40.018
not only do I
fully support you

33:40.061 --> 33:41.628
trying out for
the Cape Cod League.

33:41.671 --> 33:46.241
I want to help get you
ready, both of you.

33:47.677 --> 33:49.070
Oh, bet.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.680
Jessie: You two are gonna
need to commit

33:50.724 --> 33:52.726
to Cape Cod training on top
of your Bringston practices.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.293
I'm down with that. D.?

33:54.336 --> 33:56.251
Oh, yeah.
Sounds dope to me.

33:56.295 --> 33:58.688
But before
the new diet kicks in,

33:58.732 --> 34:00.821
I'mma need one
of these red velvet cupcakes.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.475
Toast, Pops?

34:02.518 --> 34:04.303
All right.

34:07.393 --> 34:09.786
J.R.: You know you can have
too many of those, right?

34:09.830 --> 34:11.440
Who you
talking to?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.876
J.R.: I'm talking to you.
Who you think I'm talking to?

34:12.920 --> 34:14.878
Mmm.

34:14.922 --> 34:16.576
Uh, I'm gonna
catch you later,

34:16.619 --> 34:18.056
all right?

34:18.099 --> 34:19.231
Hold on.
Where you going?

34:19.274 --> 34:20.754
Let him go.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.067
You two showed
me something.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.677
This is the kind
of leadership

34:30.719 --> 34:32.766
that has earned
you both a spot

34:32.809 --> 34:34.159
in the top 6.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.204
Simone: Wait. What?
Thea: Seriously?

34:36.248 --> 34:38.119
Well, Coach Loni and I
were already talking

34:38.163 --> 34:40.904
about making
a change.

34:40.947 --> 34:43.472
Enjoy your
victory, ladies.

34:45.126 --> 34:46.475
What!

34:46.518 --> 34:48.172
I was not
expecting that.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.652
Definitely
not top 6...

34:49.696 --> 34:51.045
Right.

34:51.089 --> 34:54.440
but us thriving under
high-stakes situations,

34:54.483 --> 34:56.311
it's what we do,
but we can't seem
to be cool

34:56.355 --> 34:57.921
on a regular-ass day.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.314
Girl, why is that?

34:59.358 --> 35:01.099
Maybe for now,
we'll just take the win

35:01.142 --> 35:02.535
that we're learning
to be teammates,

35:02.578 --> 35:04.537
and maybe
that's enough.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.582
Simone: Yeah.
Thea: Yeah.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.845
Simone: Congrats.
Thea: You, too.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.949
Marcus, what
are you doing here?

35:25.993 --> 35:27.603
I'm ready to
share the plan.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.083
Look, I knew you
needed more room

35:29.127 --> 35:30.693
in the board room
today, so instead,

35:30.737 --> 35:32.086
I got you more time.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.392
I don't understand.

35:33.435 --> 35:34.567
The owner
of the building,

35:34.610 --> 35:36.177
he's a Bringston
baseball fan,

35:36.221 --> 35:38.005
in particular,
a fan of mine.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.180
I convinced him
to hold off

35:39.224 --> 35:40.877
selling the building
for 90 days.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.270
Are you serious?

35:42.314 --> 35:43.663
It'll give you more time
to come up with a plan

35:43.706 --> 35:45.273
to acquire the building
for all students.

35:45.317 --> 35:46.579
Oh, my God. Cool.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.450
Marcus, thank you.
Thank you.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.540
This is a huge help,
and I know your job

35:51.584 --> 35:53.455
is on the line if anyone
knows you did this,

35:53.499 --> 35:55.109
so it stays
between us.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.677
I would
appreciate that.

35:58.678 --> 36:01.594
Is there
something else?

36:03.073 --> 36:05.293
Well, actually,
there is.

36:05.337 --> 36:08.470
Since we're on
the topic of timing,

36:08.514 --> 36:11.169
last month when
I told you I loved you,

36:11.212 --> 36:13.171
you didn't have
a response...

36:13.214 --> 36:15.085
[Chuckles]

36:15.129 --> 36:16.826
so I think I need
to tell you now

36:16.870 --> 36:18.959
in a different way.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.273
[Knock on door]

36:32.581 --> 36:35.367
Damon: Thea, what are you--
Thea: I suck.

36:37.369 --> 36:40.720
Your father dies,
and I--

36:40.763 --> 36:42.461
I didn't want to say
the wrong thing,

36:42.504 --> 36:44.027
so I ended up
not saying

36:44.071 --> 36:45.246
anything at all,
which is--

36:45.290 --> 36:47.335
Thea, it's--
it's cool.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.337
No, it's not,

36:49.381 --> 36:52.862
and I know
we may not be

36:52.906 --> 36:55.430
what we used to be,
but I'd like to get back

36:55.474 --> 36:59.521
to where we started,
as friends.

37:01.306 --> 37:02.698
Um, yeah.

37:02.742 --> 37:06.528
Um, I'd
like that, too.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.400
OK, but just so you know,

37:08.443 --> 37:10.967
I won't always
get it right.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.709
It's all good.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.756
I mean, I've been known
to get it wrong, too.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.644
Keisha, what are
you doing here?

37:35.688 --> 37:37.298
I brought you
something.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.213
My mom used to say
the best way

37:39.257 --> 37:41.911
to say sorry
is a big pot

37:41.955 --> 37:44.262
of apology spaghetti.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.307
Keisha, you
don't have to--

37:46.351 --> 37:48.614
No. I do.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.051
What went down earlier
wasn't about you.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.966
I'm sorry.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.881
Thank you,

37:54.924 --> 37:56.752
and even
if you disagree

37:56.796 --> 37:58.363
with how
I handled things,

37:58.406 --> 38:01.453
I am always looking
out for you.

38:03.019 --> 38:05.326
But in the future,
what's said to Dr. P.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.328
will stay
with Dr. P.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.244
I appreciate that.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.769
Now, come on. I know
you're not about to
make me eat alone.

38:13.813 --> 38:14.988
Of course not.

38:15.031 --> 38:17.860
Your dinner guest will
be here in 15 minutes.

38:19.949 --> 38:23.562
Dr. P., you're kind

38:23.605 --> 38:27.783
and caring
and protective.
