WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:03.166
(loud, overlapping chatter)

00:09.270 --> 00:11.409
Look, I am the one who
is suffering here.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.169
Oh, yes, tell us
your troubles.

00:13.210 --> 00:15.030
I am handling all
of Will's cases,

00:15.080 --> 00:16.274
and now we've lost
Caitlin, too.

00:16.310 --> 00:18.141
Look, we put someone else into
Will's seat, that's what we do.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.579
Excuse me. I'm
sitting right here.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.746
There is no
"Will's seat."

00:20.780 --> 00:21.576
You're not here as a lawyer.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.417
You might as well
not be here at all.

00:23.450 --> 00:25.315
That is not the subject
of this discussion.

00:26.690 --> 00:29.352
Someone spoke to the
bar disciplinary board.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.722
Someone said Will was
here working on cases.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.627
Now, I'm not going to
do anything so dramatic

00:34.660 --> 00:36.298
as to ask, "Who was it?"

00:36.330 --> 00:38.195
But I will say this.
If you have an issue

00:38.230 --> 00:39.834
with the way we're running
this firm, you come to me.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.735
You do not stab Will
in the back.

00:41.770 --> 00:44.364
You don't lie
to the disciplinary board...

00:44.410 --> 00:45.661
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.304
Look, I know
nobody wants to respond

00:48.340 --> 00:50.479
because we don't want
to look like Judases,

00:50.510 --> 00:52.478
but Will is working on cases.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.112
No, I'm updating

00:54.150 --> 00:55.777
associates on the
background of my cases.

00:55.820 --> 00:56.684
What?!

00:56.720 --> 00:57.414
DAVID:
Oh, come on.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.213
You call me
an ethical midget?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.613
(loud, overlapping shouting)

01:01.720 --> 01:03.688
Just a minute!
Wait a minute!

01:03.730 --> 01:06.790
We disagree with each
other, we keep it in-house!

01:06.830 --> 01:09.765
you want to backstab someone,
do it right here.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.768
Okay, I disagree. There.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.291
And I urge the equity partners
to replace Will

01:14.340 --> 01:15.534
until such time...

01:15.570 --> 01:18.232
Then marshal the equity partner
votes, and call a meeting.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.238
Are we done here?
No.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.702
Alicia's asked for a raise.

01:21.740 --> 01:22.877
(people sighing)

01:22.910 --> 01:24.775
I am advocating
a ten percent bump.

01:24.810 --> 01:27.711
No, you have a dozen
third-year associates who will

01:27.750 --> 01:29.581
be asking for the
same exact thing.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.588
Then we lose her.
And how do
you know that?

01:31.620 --> 01:33.417
Because he's got
a dog in the fight.
We only want

01:33.460 --> 01:35.712
Alicia because of her
ties to her husband.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.387
No, we want her
because she's good.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.783
(laughs)
We're gonna take
your word for it?

01:38.830 --> 01:40.798
ELI:
Look, look, we all know
we're gonna compromise.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.854
Can we just compromise?

01:41.900 --> 01:44.095
(loud, overlapping chatter)

01:47.870 --> 01:49.906
Who do you
think leaked it?

01:49.940 --> 01:51.737
Could be any one of them.

01:51.770 --> 01:54.830
Good thing they don't like
each other, or I'd be dead.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.098
Where you headed?
Court.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.846
Why? You don't have
a case today.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.347
DIANE:
Diane Lockhart.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.838
L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.

02:04.890 --> 02:07.711
JACK:
And can you describe
what happened,

02:07.760 --> 02:09.284
Ms. Lockhart?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.218
Yes. I was walking
from my car

02:11.260 --> 02:16.721
when I saw you in the lobby,
serving a subpoena to that man.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.192
JACK:
And did you hear me
announce myself?

02:18.230 --> 02:20.266
Ah, yes. I heard you say,

02:20.300 --> 02:22.268
"Mr. Dobbs,
you have been served."

02:22.310 --> 02:24.835
Then what happened?

02:24.870 --> 02:26.804
In your own words,
Ms. Lockhart.

02:28.810 --> 02:32.268
Uh, well, uh,
that man tried to punch you,

02:32.320 --> 02:34.276
and then you threw him

02:34.320 --> 02:36.288
against the wall.
In a manly fashion?

02:36.320 --> 02:38.880
Yes, I would say so.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.411
He says I threw the first punch.
That's why he's suing me.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.428
Uh, that is not
what I observed.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.781
You two know each other.
That's why she's saying that.

02:45.830 --> 02:48.754
Do you and I know each other,
Ms. Lockhart?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.859
Uh, well, you

02:50.900 --> 02:52.436
served me with a subpoena,

02:52.470 --> 02:54.631
so I guess to that extent,
we know each other.

02:54.670 --> 02:55.762
JACK:
Thank you, Ms. Lockhart.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.598
Your presence here in
small-claims court is a breath

02:58.640 --> 02:59.572
of fresh air.

02:59.610 --> 03:00.679
(gavelbangs)
Objection.

03:00.710 --> 03:01.802
Overruled.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.705
And I will ask you to proceed,

03:03.750 --> 03:05.809
Mrs. Florrick.
So the video

03:05.850 --> 03:07.511
was taken from the back
of the snowmobile?

03:07.550 --> 03:09.484
Uh, yes,
my-my wife was taking it.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.385
That's just
her cell phone camera.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.956
(engine rewing)

03:12.990 --> 03:14.480
And that's you driving?

03:14.520 --> 03:17.489
Yes. Up at the Rollins
Savanna Forest Preserve.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.656
(laughter on video)

03:18.690 --> 03:20.396
ALICIA:
Then what happened?

03:20.430 --> 03:23.820
The snowmobile-- it just started
changing directions.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.861
WOMAN:
Okay, Grant, slow down.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.835
ALICIA: _ _
Were you steering it
toward the trees?

03:28.870 --> 03:30.007
GRANT:
No.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.462
WOMAN:
What are you doing?!

03:31.510 --> 03:32.829
_ GRANT:
The steering column locked, and

03:32.880 --> 03:34.006
I...

03:34.040 --> 03:35.871
WOMAN:
It's not funny. Stop.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.741
I couldn't budge it.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.270
Please slow down!

03:39.320 --> 03:41.948
Grant, slow down! Please!

03:41.980 --> 03:43.982
(woman screaming, thudding)

03:51.030 --> 03:52.998
And what happened
to your wife?

03:53.030 --> 03:54.998
(clears throat)

03:55.030 --> 03:56.861
She was in a coma for a week,

03:56.900 --> 03:58.891
and then she...

04:00.940 --> 04:02.999
She... she didn't make it.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.577
And that's why you're suing
Snow Plain, the makers

04:07.610 --> 04:08.736
of your snowmobile?

04:08.780 --> 04:10.042
Yes. Uh,
I've never

04:10.080 --> 04:11.877
sued anyone in my life.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.844
Never had much use
for the courts.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.710
My-my parents told me,

04:14.750 --> 04:16.911
"If you have a problem
with someone,

04:16.950 --> 04:19.680
then, you say it to his face,"
but my wife...

04:19.720 --> 04:21.688
(crying)

04:21.720 --> 04:23.984
She was the best
thing in my life.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.918
JUDGE:
Okay, let me interrupt
right there.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.689
Mrs. Florrick, Mr. Hines,

04:27.730 --> 04:29.698
why don't you come up
here, and we'll talk?

04:29.730 --> 04:31.061
Here's the deal.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.398
First of all, good
morning to you all.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.566
ALL:
Good morning.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.737
We're going into chambers

04:35.770 --> 04:36.634
for a bench-supervised
negoﬁaﬂon.

04:36.670 --> 04:38.399
HINES:
Your Honor,
that's not necessary.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.577
Counselor Hines, it is.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.430
Your case here
is obVIously

04:41.480 --> 04:42.970
to delay
until Mr. Duverney gives up.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.547
That's not true!
And I'm not gonna
be a party to that.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.775
There are no _real
legal issues to dispute,

04:47.820 --> 04:48.809
so here is my order.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.910
Marshal your settlement
arguments and meet me

04:51.950 --> 04:53.451
in chambers in one hour.
Understood?

04:53.490 --> 04:55.879
ALL:
Yes, Your Honor.
(gavelbangs)

04:55.920 --> 04:58.059
I think I might try my hand
at this lavwering.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.354
Very impressive.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.095
So I have to thank you.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.327
There's an art show, or
something or other,near here.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.894
(laughing):
You're not really into art?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.363
No, but I don't
actively dislike it.
(laughs)

05:09.410 --> 05:11.970
I'm sorry, but I have
to head back to work.

05:12.010 --> 05:14.001
But you do have
to have lunch.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.919
Actually, I think
someone's waiting for you?

05:19.950 --> 05:23.113
Okay, then, tonight.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.686
I'll call you.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.711
(birds singing)

05:28.020 --> 05:30.022
GRANT:
You thinking of buying?

05:32.730 --> 05:34.891
I don't know what I'm thinking.
Everything's so expensive

05:34.930 --> 05:35.954
these days.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.389
Well, you know one thing
I learned is, life is short.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.966
You get a chance to bring
yourself some pleasure,

05:40.000 --> 05:41.365
you should do it.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.359
Even ifI had the money,
I... I don't know.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.877
It's my old house.

05:46.910 --> 05:48.878
Doesn't make sense
to go bacloNards.

05:48.910 --> 05:51.140
Hmm. Look at me.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.375
I'd give anything
to go bacloNard.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.810
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick, the judge
is ready for you now.

05:56.850 --> 05:58.112
Here we go.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.811
What is it about glasses?

05:59.860 --> 06:02.010
I seem to walk into a room,
and they disappear.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.925
HINES:
Your Honor, this is not
just about one suit.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.689
This is about the class action

06:05.730 --> 06:07.095
that Lockhart & Gardner has
in the wings...

06:07.130 --> 06:09.667
No, it is about one suit.
We're asking for $5 million

06:09.700 --> 06:11.065
for pain and suffering,
loss of spousal support...

06:11.100 --> 06:12.829
JUDGE:
You know, I used
to carry around

06:12.870 --> 06:15.065
three or four pair of glasses.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.068
At the end of the day,

06:17.110 --> 06:19.977
I was like a drunk
looking for bottles. Ugh!

06:20.010 --> 06:21.932
You're paying, Mr. Hines.

06:21.980 --> 06:24.676
By the evidence I've
seen, you're paying.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.747
The only question is,
how much?
But you haven't
seen this evidence.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.919
What is it?
Grant Duverney's
medical report.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.009
From 2009.
Before the accident.

06:32.050 --> 06:34.780
Yes, but after his career as
a professional hockey player.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.856
What does that have to do
with anything?

06:36.890 --> 06:38.881
Modiﬁed comparative
negngnce.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.989
If your client contributed
to the accident--

06:41.030 --> 06:42.895
in fact-- if he
contributed more

06:42.930 --> 06:45.023
than 50% to the accident--
then he can't sue us.

06:45.070 --> 06:46.833
You're saying that
he's responsible

06:46.870 --> 06:48.599
for his wife's death?
I'm saying,
given his mental capacity

06:48.640 --> 06:50.938
after 86 games as a professional
hockey player--

06:50.970 --> 06:52.801
body checks and fights--

06:52.840 --> 06:55.035
he had no business getting
on that snowmobile.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.071
Your Honor, this...
is despicable.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.749
And yet legal, Counselor.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.441
You're saying, Counselor Hines,

07:01.480 --> 07:03.619
that the plaintiff
caused his own accident

07:03.650 --> 07:05.015
by steering into a tree?

07:05.050 --> 07:06.517
I'm saying, it contributed.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.812
The plaintiff's
apparent condition--

07:08.860 --> 07:10.555
chronic traumatic
encephalopathy--

07:10.590 --> 07:12.626
was more than 50%
of the problem.

07:12.660 --> 07:14.491
Okay.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.020
I'll be ordering an independent

07:16.060 --> 07:18.995
neurological evaluation
on Mr. Duverney.

07:19.030 --> 07:21.032
We'll see where
that takes us.

07:23.070 --> 07:25.038
_ JULIUS:
Ba5ically, we're in trouble.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.038
DIANE:
How can we be in trouble?
We were in negotiations on this.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.968
They're going after
his hockey career.

07:29.010 --> 07:31.501
And Judge Rigby is
giving them some rope.
So there's truth

07:31.550 --> 07:33.108
in their charges?

07:33.150 --> 07:35.971
Grant played 86 games
as a pro hockey player,

07:36.020 --> 07:39.717
and in his 86th start, he
was in a fight on the ice,

07:39.760 --> 07:40.852
and ended up in the hospital.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.120
He never played again. His
motor functions were impaired.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.718
So, there might be truth.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.694
And how did we not
see this coming?

07:46.730 --> 07:47.651
(man clearing his throat)

07:47.700 --> 07:49.019
Do you have a minute?

07:51.730 --> 07:54.699
So, this was my case.
Yes.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.062
And supposedly, a winner.
Which it still is, but I have

07:58.110 --> 08:01.807
some strategic information
I could... share with you.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.104
_ If it weren't for the _
restrictions of your suspen5ion?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.812
Yes, which, as I understand it,
prevents me from talking about

08:06.850 --> 08:09.148
future strategy,
but not...
Past. That would
be updating?

08:09.180 --> 08:10.784
Which is within my rights.

08:10.820 --> 08:13.983
Yet, we seem to be
in here whispering.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.215
(whispers):
Consulting.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.285
What do you got?

08:18.330 --> 08:19.695
Bring hockey into it.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.721
Into our case?

08:21.760 --> 08:25.161
Yes. Their defense is based on
modified comparative negligence.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.169
If our client is responsible
for 50% of his accident,

08:28.200 --> 08:30.998
he loses, but...

08:31.040 --> 08:34.100
If professional hockey is
responsible for his injuries,

08:34.140 --> 08:34.936
then he can collect.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.107
And this is your
suggested strategy?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.799
It is.

08:38.850 --> 08:39.839
Well, Diane,

08:39.880 --> 08:41.973
this is a mistake.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.146
Hockey will never pay.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.112
To pay would be to
open up themselves

08:45.150 --> 08:47.118
to hundreds of lawsuits
from former players.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.549
It's part of the strategy.
Pull hockey into this.

08:49.590 --> 08:50.818
They'll want to bury it

08:50.860 --> 08:52.828
quickly and quietly.
We found our deep pocket.

08:52.860 --> 08:55.249
Yes, and in addition,
the APHL lawyers will delay.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.120
So we'll get
a three-month continuance

08:57.170 --> 08:59.092
to build our case.
You want me on it?

08:59.130 --> 09:00.688
DIANE:
Um, I do, but a low priority.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.901
And, Alicia,
do you have a moment?
Yes.

09:07.010 --> 09:10.673
So, we want to keep
you happy here, Alicia.

09:10.710 --> 09:14.043
We value all your hard work
these past few months.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.240
Thank you.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.145
Given that, the equity
partners have agreed

09:17.190 --> 09:19.886
on paper to a
bump in your pay.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.057
Great.

09:21.090 --> 09:22.978
Uh, yes, but we want
to be clear.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.884
There are 11 other
third-year associates,

09:24.930 --> 09:26.921
so, we can't afford
an across-the-board raise.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.655
I understand.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.065
So, here's what we're offering.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.133
I know, it's not as much
as you think you deserve,

09:36.170 --> 09:37.637
but take it as a demonstration

09:37.670 --> 09:39.672
of_ our confidence
in your future.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.799
KALIN DA:
Hey.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.704
Thought you might
want something.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.047
No, thanks.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.616
You don't know who's leaking

09:48.650 --> 09:50.686
to the disciplinary board
about me, do you?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.915
No. You want me to look?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.279
No. Just if you hear anything.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.720
You in trouble?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.751
Sticking to the letter
of the law.

09:58.790 --> 10:00.758
You gonna leave me
here with two beers?

10:00.800 --> 10:03.121
You'll find somebody.

10:18.710 --> 10:19.938
KALIN DA:
What's up?

10:19.980 --> 10:21.140
You want a beer?

10:25.190 --> 10:26.282
No. Thanks.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.810
You're sure?

10:27.860 --> 10:30.021
It's open.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.851
Kalinda, I...

10:35.860 --> 10:37.862
I'm sorry.

10:39.170 --> 10:41.695
I can't help it. I want
to move on, but I...

10:41.740 --> 10:43.002
Yeah, I... I get it.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.166
Look, we're working together.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.131
That's good enough, isn't it?

10:45.170 --> 10:47.331
Yeah.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.178
It's just not
easy for me...
It's okay, Alicia.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.872
I get it.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.321
I'm Louis Canning, Your Honor.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.089
I'll be representing
the interests

11:10.130 --> 11:11.392
of the All Professional
Hockey League.

11:11.430 --> 11:13.398
JUDGE:
Welcome, Mr. Canning; you
saw the amended complaint?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.238
I did, Your Honor, and a baroque
piece of work it is.

11:16.270 --> 11:17.703
Baroque, and yet,

11:17.740 --> 11:19.207
if Snow Plain insists

11:19.240 --> 11:21.800
on a modified comparative
negligence defense,

11:21.840 --> 11:23.148
I see no other option

11:23.180 --> 11:25.045
than to offer the plaintiff
a chance to combine

11:25.080 --> 11:28.049
charges of negligence. Darn.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.342
Yes, Your Honor, we accept
the modified complaint.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.211
Then I expect you'll be
asking for an extension?

11:31.250 --> 11:34.083
Oh, no, no,
we're ready to go.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.883
Right now.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.227
In fact, we welcome the chance

11:38.260 --> 11:40.251
to defend the honor
of professional hockey.

11:42.830 --> 11:43.819
He thinks
you're not prepared.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.499
Excuse me, Will,
you can't be saying anything.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.361
We need to move quickly
on all fronts.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.763
I'll get on with Kalinda.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.013
ANNOUNCER: They still can't
clear it, as Olsen keeps it in,

12:06.190 --> 12:08.351
Duverney, in the corner,
tied up right now with Raker.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.085
And here we go.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.758
KALINDA: That's Cameron Raker,
Minnesota's enforcer.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.223
You just had to expect this.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.296
A lot of bad blood between
these two teams.

12:17.330 --> 12:18.194
Oh, my!

12:18.230 --> 12:19.959
Raker landed one square on.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.888
He's flat on...

12:21.940 --> 12:25.103
KALINDA: There was a criminal
battery investigation in 2009,

12:25.140 --> 12:27.074
but charges
were never brought.

12:27.110 --> 12:28.236
DIANE: It would be helpful
to get that investigation.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.338
I'm on it.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.506
Good, and Will has a friend

12:30.550 --> 12:32.404
who's a top neurologist
at Northwestern.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.772
A Dr. Wedd, he specializes
in sports injuries.

12:35.820 --> 12:38.243
He's agreed to testify
as to how team doctors

12:38.290 --> 12:39.348
mishandled Grant.
I'll prep him.

12:39.390 --> 12:40.812
Great.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.555
Mr. Canning thinks he's
caught us off guard.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.058
Let's show him he hasn't, hmm?

12:45.090 --> 12:46.159
Hi, Marina, I've decided
against the house.

12:46.190 --> 12:48.397
I just don't have the money
for the down payment.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.395
Yes, I'll call
if anything changes,

12:52.430 --> 12:53.897
but I don't think it will.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.134
This is me in reporter mode.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.229
Ah, very impressive.
How was London?

12:57.270 --> 12:59.830
London-y?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.199
How was here?

13:01.240 --> 13:02.468
You're looking
pretty casual today.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.398
A lot has happened.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.975
I'm gonna be taping this,
if that's all right.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.874
It is, but I don't
have much to say.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.286
Sporting News has me covering
this hockey lawsuit.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.050
I'm just wondering,
are you crazy?

13:14.090 --> 13:15.352
Going up against hockey?

13:15.390 --> 13:17.221
Here's the problem,
Miss Linnata.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.921
It was my suit,

13:18.960 --> 13:21.849
but I've had a little
legal trouble of my own,

13:21.900 --> 13:22.992
and I've been suspended

13:23.030 --> 13:24.497
from practicing law
for six months.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.998
You?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.291
Really?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.035
What happened?

13:30.070 --> 13:31.401
I cut some corners.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.168
I'm a corner-cutter.

13:32.210 --> 13:34.906
Ah, so this
is a 12-step program?

13:34.940 --> 13:37.443
Yes, step three,
admitting my faults.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.278
I had to hand off the case
to other fine lawyers here,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.880
so you probably want
to ask Julius Cain

13:42.920 --> 13:45.218
whether he's crazy
to go after hockey.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.888
And who's the other lavwer?
What?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.410
You said there were two lavwers.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.451
Who's the other lawyer?
Alicia Florrick.

13:50.490 --> 13:53.459
Oh... yes.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.923
Alicia. How is she doing?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.188
Good.

13:57.230 --> 13:58.390
Good.

13:58.430 --> 14:01.593
I'm so glad for her.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.260
Well...

14:05.310 --> 14:07.870
it was good seeing you, Will.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.071
You're looking good.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.919
Thank you.
You are, too.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.941
Good luck
with your other nine steps.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.313
The league ended up suspending
Cameron Raker

14:18.350 --> 14:19.487
for the rest of the season,

14:19.520 --> 14:22.011
so the state's attorney
at the time,

14:22.060 --> 14:23.357
Peter Florrick,

14:23.390 --> 14:25.620
thought it wasn't
worth pursuing.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.389
But what was
the charge gonna be?

14:27.430 --> 14:29.352
I mean, why was
this treated different

14:29.400 --> 14:31.163
than any other fight on the ice?

14:31.200 --> 14:34.499
Well, the concussion was severe,
and we were looking into it

14:34.540 --> 14:35.962
being a premeditated hit.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.467
Raker targeted our client?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.398
The whole team targeted
your client.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.001
Any chance I could see the
investigative report on that?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.245
Or just a peek?

14:45.280 --> 14:49.148
Funny that you've been sent here
and not Kalinda.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.284
I volunteered.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.982
(chuckles)
Really?

14:56.090 --> 14:58.081
Why?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.552
I don't know.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.289
How are you doing?

15:04.330 --> 15:08.266
Well, I'm not
in the deputy's office.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.007
Yes, I, um... I wasn't
gonna say anything.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.359
Things have changed.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.378
Self-inflicted wound.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.378
Are you safe?

15:16.410 --> 15:19.402
Nobody's told me otherwise,

15:19.450 --> 15:22.010
and that usually means no.

15:22.050 --> 15:25.110
Thank you.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.082
Cameron Raker.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.486
I am a professional
ice hockey left-winger.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.329
ALICIA:
And you're the team's enforcer?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.419
CANNING:
Objection, Your Honor, that's
not an official hockey position.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.621
Mrs. Florrick is just using the
term to bias these proceedings.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.696
I don't understand;
what's the bias?

15:36.730 --> 15:38.129
Well, an enforcer

15:38.170 --> 15:40.138
is someone on a hockey
team who responds

15:40.170 --> 15:42.161
to supposedly dirty plays
from the opposing team

15:42.200 --> 15:44.134
by attacking aggressively...

15:44.170 --> 15:46.559
And thank you, Mrs. Florrick,
for that biased definition.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.636
Well, do you want me
to explain the bias or not?

15:49.680 --> 15:50.977
Okay, thank you.

15:51.010 --> 15:53.046
I am enlightened without bias.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.342
Mr. Raker,

15:54.380 --> 15:56.075
what is the official title
for your p05ition?

15:56.120 --> 15:57.348
RAKER:
Uh, left wing.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.688
Okay, that's what we'll
call it from now on.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.585
Left wing.
And I...

16:01.620 --> 16:04.123
Um...

16:04.160 --> 16:06.458
Mr. Raker...

16:06.490 --> 16:08.424
in your capacity
as a left-winger,

16:08.460 --> 16:10.098
did your coach ever ask you

16:10.130 --> 16:12.519
to violently respond
to a dirty play?

16:12.570 --> 16:15.459
He asked me to check offenders
who crossed the line, you know?

16:15.500 --> 16:18.139
And has he ever asked you
to take a player out?

16:18.170 --> 16:20.331
If you mean "out" by checking
those offenders legally,

16:20.380 --> 16:21.404
then yes.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.649
That's Christian Lund,
your teammate,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.113
the star player
under contract

16:27.150 --> 16:28.242
for 6.3 million?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.474
Yeah.
I'm sorry,

16:29.520 --> 16:31.044
I've got to come closer;
I can't see.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.978
Oh, certainly, Your Honor.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.582
And who is that

16:37.630 --> 16:38.779
who took out
your star player?

16:38.830 --> 16:41.048
Him.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.125
ANNOUNCER:
Oh, devastating hit

16:43.170 --> 16:45.058
by Duverney on Lund.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.397
And the best man on the ice

16:46.430 --> 16:47.397
is taken down by a fourth-liner.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.603
Was your team outraged
by this hit, Mr. Raker?

16:50.640 --> 16:52.631
I wouldn't say we were outraged.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.535
We were concerned.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.808
Lund is pretty important to us.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.547
But did you see
this postgame interview?

16:58.580 --> 17:02.141
You hit us like that,
it's not over.

17:02.180 --> 17:04.148
We've got your number, Duverney.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.078
We'll see you in February.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.610
RAKER:
Nope, didn't see it.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.685
But isn't that your jersey,

17:09.720 --> 17:10.789
Mr. Raker,

17:10.830 --> 17:11.819
in the background

17:11.860 --> 17:13.191
within earshot
of this interview?

17:13.230 --> 17:15.357
Uh...

17:15.400 --> 17:16.549
(exhales)
Looks like it.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.091
I-I don't remember.
And by, "We'll see you
in February,"

17:19.130 --> 17:21.234
did your coach mean
the next time you were playing

17:21.270 --> 17:23.158
against my client's team?

17:23.210 --> 17:24.404
I don't know,

17:24.440 --> 17:25.361
could have
meant anything, really.

17:25.410 --> 17:29.699
But didn't it mean this game
on February 15?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.118
I don't know.

17:35.150 --> 17:37.118
Maybe.

17:37.150 --> 17:39.084
I guess.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.512
KALINDA:
We've got a problem here.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.381
No, it's your neurologist friend
at Northwestern,

17:45.430 --> 17:48.627
Dr. Wedd, the one we want
to hire for the trial.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.662
He says he's never heard of you.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.564
He what?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.659
Yeah, he said he was
too busy to talk,

17:53.700 --> 17:55.565
and then he just rushed
out of the ofﬁce.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.306
You know what I think?

17:57.340 --> 17:59.103
Yeah,
'cause I'm thinking it, too.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.209
Canning got to him.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.207
Paid him off.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.673
Do we have a second-best option?

18:02.710 --> 18:04.701
No, not for hockey
impact studies.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.502
You may have another play.

18:06.550 --> 18:11.112
Given that I can't suggest
new legal strategy,

18:11.150 --> 18:13.311
I think you'll know
what I'm about to say.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.214
Find out
if Canning paid him off,

18:15.260 --> 18:16.659
and see if we can prove fraud.

18:16.690 --> 18:18.282
Obviously, I can't comment,

18:18.330 --> 18:19.786
but it sounds like you're
in movement.

18:19.830 --> 18:20.819
Iam.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.657
Following your
neurologist friend

18:22.700 --> 18:24.668
to see if he's going
to meet up with Canning.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.691
Obviously, I can't comment.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.334
I will keep you
in the loop.

18:28.370 --> 18:29.735
Not at my urging.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.635
Bye.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.275
Okay, let me know
when you find out more.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.572
Mm-hmm.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.646
(beep)

18:37.680 --> 18:40.513
Back to our old
ways, are we?

18:40.550 --> 18:42.177
And what ways
might those be?

18:42.220 --> 18:44.745
Paying off our
neurological expert.

18:46.390 --> 18:47.618
Are you happy

18:47.660 --> 18:49.184
at Lockhart & Gardner,
Mrs. Florrick?

18:49.220 --> 18:50.426
I am happy.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.552
You don't look happy.
Uh-huh.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.420
Why are you second chair
to Julius

18:52.460 --> 18:54.496
when you're doing
all the heaw lifting?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.395
Because Julius is
an eqUIty partner.

18:56.430 --> 18:58.159
And you're not;
why is that?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.326
Okay.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.588
Here's the problem.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.359
I see how we treat
lawyers who are poached.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.207
They're the first
ones out the door.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.776
They're the ones
we don't trust,

19:07.810 --> 19:10.699
and that is why I
will not be poached.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.947
The problem at
Lockhart & Gardner is they
treat it like a family.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.369
They treat loyalty
as an absolute good.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.614
And it's not?

19:17.650 --> 19:18.548
At home it is; at work

19:18.590 --> 19:20.888
i_t's talent
and profe55ionalism that matter.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.683
That's why
I don't hold a grudge.

19:22.720 --> 19:23.926
You come and work for me,

19:23.960 --> 19:26.849
you'll be judged on the value
of your work and only your work.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.357
Let me make you an offer.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.789
No.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.969
Afraid Mommy and Daddy
at Lockhart & Gardner

19:33.000 --> 19:34.638
might get upset?

19:34.670 --> 19:36.490
I'll see you in court.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.508
See you in court.

19:38.540 --> 19:39.859
And, Dr. Rubich,
as the team doctor,

19:39.910 --> 19:41.969
you were the first
to assess Grant's injuries?

19:42.010 --> 19:43.477
Yes, I examined Grant

19:43.510 --> 19:45.273
in the dressing room
right after the fight.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.619
And you tested him
for symptoms of concussion?
Yes.

19:47.650 --> 19:48.776
How long was the examination?

19:48.820 --> 19:50.617
About 15 minutes.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.686
And then you cleared him
to get back into the game?
He seemed fine.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.814
He, uh, even made a pretty
hard check in the last minute.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.987
Saved the team a goal.
And yet, three days later,

19:58.030 --> 20:00.726
he was in the hospital
and never played again.
Yes, that's my understanding.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.228
When you conducted
my client's exit physical,

20:03.270 --> 20:05.727
what did you write in the file
in regard to head injuries?

20:05.770 --> 20:07.499
I didn't write anything.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.337
I saw no need to.

20:09.370 --> 20:10.667
CANNING:
Dr. Rubich,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.666
what's a baseline test?

20:12.710 --> 20:15.634
It's a neuro-psychological
test we run on players

20:15.680 --> 20:17.375
before the start
of the season.

20:17.410 --> 20:20.675
In the event they suffer
a head injury during a game,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.847
we can determine
if it's a concu55ion

20:22.880 --> 20:24.518
by comparing the results.

20:24.550 --> 20:26.415
And did you perform
those tests on Grant Duverney

20:26.450 --> 20:27.815
after he was knocked down
by Cameron Raker?

20:27.860 --> 20:28.610
Yes, and the results

20:28.660 --> 20:30.821
were identical
with the baseline.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.782
There were no signs
of brain trauma.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.627
So, in other words,
you did your job?

20:34.660 --> 20:35.695
(chuckles)
Yes.

20:35.730 --> 20:37.266
Thank you, Doctor.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.495
We need our neurologist.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.636
Kalinda thinks he'll meet
with Canning after court.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.661
(horn honking)

21:01.560 --> 21:02.913
(beep)

21:02.960 --> 21:03.984
(line ringing)

21:04.030 --> 21:05.679
DIANE:
Hello?

21:05.730 --> 21:06.822
(music playing over phone)

21:06.860 --> 21:08.396
Diane?

21:08.430 --> 21:09.522
KaHnda?

21:09.560 --> 21:10.663
Yeah,

21:10.700 --> 21:12.725
guess who our
neurologist is with?

21:12.770 --> 21:13.759
Canning?

21:13.800 --> 21:14.789
No, not Canning.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.990
Frank Michael Thomas.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.803
What, the actor?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.478
And the lawyer.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.478
I don't understand, what does
he have to do with hockey?

21:22.510 --> 21:24.978
I have no idea,
but I thought

21:25.010 --> 21:26.807
you should come down
and talk to him.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.910
No, I can't right now.

21:29.950 --> 21:32.418
(beeping)
Um, just take
some pictures and...

21:34.520 --> 21:36.852
Uh, yeah, just do
what you normally do.

21:36.890 --> 21:37.982
I'll talk to you.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.782
Just call Alicia and Will.

21:39.830 --> 21:42.025
(beep)

21:42.060 --> 21:43.368
Hello, Jack.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.664
Shall I assume
you're 40 minutes late

21:45.700 --> 21:46.928
because of Australian
standard time?

21:46.970 --> 21:48.528
I wish it were the case.

21:48.570 --> 21:50.629
I also wish you won't hate me

21:50.670 --> 21:52.604
when I tell you
I have a complication.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.107
Another time, Diane, I promise.

21:54.140 --> 21:56.506
Just tell me you don't hate me.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.802
I don't hate you.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.910
Go uncomplicate
your complication.

22:00.950 --> 22:03.612
(beep)

22:03.650 --> 22:05.641
*

22:12.930 --> 22:14.989
(beep)

22:15.030 --> 22:17.419
(line ringing)

22:17.470 --> 22:19.961
You've reached the personal
voice mail of Kurt McVeigh.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.934
I'm unavailable right...

22:23.410 --> 22:25.867
(sighs)

22:25.910 --> 22:27.935
Can I have the check, please?

22:34.080 --> 22:35.877
Yes?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.808
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

22:37.850 --> 22:39.909
I-Is this...?
Are you here to see Kurt?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.552
Uh, yes.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.080
I hope I'm not, uh...

22:44.130 --> 22:46.086
No, come in.

22:48.430 --> 22:49.852
Diane.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.959
Hello.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.865
And surprise.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.937
After what, a year?

22:56.970 --> 22:59.632
Did you just happen
to be in the neighborhood?

22:59.670 --> 23:01.934
No. Uh, but I think

23:01.980 --> 23:05.040
I should call the cab back
and return to mine.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.502
Good-bye.

23:06.550 --> 23:07.744
(sighs)

23:07.780 --> 23:10.010
It's a 40-mile drive.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.758
And that's when
I found my voice.

23:18.790 --> 23:21.020
Acting is all about the voice.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.618
(laughing)

23:22.660 --> 23:24.196
Well, Will Gardner.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.527
How you doing?

23:25.570 --> 23:26.889
Good, sir.

23:26.930 --> 23:28.932
Till I found you stole
our neurologist.
Really?

23:28.970 --> 23:31.905
I didn't _realize he was in
a p05ition to be stolen.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.033
Nice to meet
you, ladies.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.547
So you're working
for Louis Canning now?

23:39.580 --> 23:41.946
Nope.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.583
You're suing hockey?

23:46.620 --> 23:48.611
Yep.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.821
Class action, seven players.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.054
Head injuries?
Yep.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.024
APHL's been mishandling
head injuries

23:54.060 --> 23:56.620
ever since the first
time they strapped

23:56.660 --> 23:59.060
a metal blade to the
underside of a boot.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.988
I'm hoping to make it right
for these players.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.530
ALICIA:
Then join us.

24:02.570 --> 24:03.901
Pool our resources.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.965
Make the league fight
a multifront war.

24:07.680 --> 24:11.172
Well, I appreciate the offer,
but, uh, my answer's got to be:

24:11.210 --> 24:13.178
not a chance in hell.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.872
Louis Canning is
using your case

24:15.920 --> 24:19.083
to establish legal precedent
before I file mine.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.759
Whupping you makes it easier
for him to fight me.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.655
Which is why he was prepared
and so eager

24:23.690 --> 24:24.850
to rush to court.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.482
FRANK:
Yep. Well, good luck.

24:26.530 --> 24:30.899
Hockey will be fighting you
to the last man.

24:30.930 --> 24:33.023
And you're going to lose.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.937
You're going to lose bad.

24:42.310 --> 24:43.208
WOMAN:
At least we're
offering a choice.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.343
Unlike your socialist,
fascist campaign,

24:44.380 --> 24:47.816
ours is a
horse race.
With four hobbled horses.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.215
Not too hobbled
to beat your man, Obama.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.081
Did you think we
were going to listen

24:51.120 --> 24:52.747
to the gray hairs,
hand it to Romney?

24:52.790 --> 24:55.008
Bloody battle's healthy--
fires people up.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.857
DIANE:
Yes, particularly
billionaires

24:56.890 --> 24:57.925
putting down payments
on candidates.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.518
Ah, the Highland
Park liberal.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.993
Cries foul
about the evil

25:01.030 --> 25:04.193
Republican super PACs as she
writes a check to Obama's.

25:04.230 --> 25:07.290
Shall we drink to your allegedly
non-activist Supreme Court?

25:07.330 --> 25:11.539
Right. Scalia, Alito,
the rest of the big, scary five.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.572
Four.
We're wearing Kennedy down.

25:13.610 --> 25:15.202
All part of our clever
Highland Park

25:15.240 --> 25:16.901
liberal plan.

25:16.940 --> 25:19.545
Well, I would
love to stay

25:19.580 --> 25:20.808
and keep proving you wrong,

25:20.850 --> 25:22.215
but I've got
an early forensics class,

25:22.250 --> 25:25.117
and my instructor
here gets surly

25:25.150 --> 25:26.640
if we're late, so...

25:26.690 --> 25:28.214
It was nice meeting
you, Diane.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.955
And you, Miranda.
Keep breathing that fire.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.753
See you
tomorrow, Kurt.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.189
Yeah.

25:37.060 --> 25:39.790
(door opens and closes)

25:39.830 --> 25:41.229
Oh, she's wonderful.

25:41.270 --> 25:42.794
Crack shot, too.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.330
Crime labs will
be climbing

25:44.370 --> 25:46.065
all over each
other to hire her.

25:46.110 --> 25:48.078
So she's your...

25:48.110 --> 25:49.532
protge?

25:51.650 --> 25:54.210
You could call her that.

25:54.250 --> 25:57.947
Well, you two certainly
are of, uh, like minds.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.685
Except I like a
good argument.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.110
Consensus is less...

26:03.160 --> 26:04.718
interesting.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.318
Hello.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.863
(laughs)

26:11.900 --> 26:13.265
Is this a regular thing?

26:13.300 --> 26:17.134
Dropping in on men you
haven't seen in a year?

26:30.420 --> 26:32.285
I could use some direction here.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.313
Wh-What exactly
is this?

26:39.090 --> 26:41.650
It's me missing you.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.225
And hoping
you feel likewise.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.637
The real estate lady called.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.409
She thinks that they'll take
ten percent down.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.749
(chuckles)

26:58.780 --> 27:01.317
What?

27:01.350 --> 27:04.342
The real estate lady
should not be telling you that.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.711
She's calling here
because she wants

27:06.750 --> 27:08.354
to get you two excited
about the house.

27:08.390 --> 27:10.255
No, she was just
being nice.

27:10.290 --> 27:11.882
I'll talk to her.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.649
She should not
be calling here.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.827
You're really trying
to make it work, huh?

27:18.700 --> 27:20.668
I don't know.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.937
GRANT:
I-I knew

27:24.970 --> 27:26.403
they'd come after me.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.429
I was a marked man.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.404
JULIUS:
Because of your check
in that first game

27:29.440 --> 27:31.169
on their star,
Christian Lund?

27:31.210 --> 27:32.677
GRANT:
Yes.

27:32.710 --> 27:33.404
JULIUS:
Cameron Raker was
six-foot-three,

27:33.450 --> 27:36.010
225 pounds.

27:36.050 --> 27:37.347
How big were
you, Grant?

27:37.380 --> 27:39.314
GRANT:
Five-eleven, 190.

27:39.350 --> 27:40.385
JULIUS:
Yet, when he
goaded you,

27:40.420 --> 27:41.819
you fought him.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.088
I had no choice.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.985
If.... if I hadn't fought,
they would have gone

27:45.030 --> 27:46.827
after one of our
star players.

27:46.860 --> 27:48.020
How can you
be so sure?

27:48.060 --> 27:49.459
'Cause we would have done
the same thing.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.365
It's... it's the game.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.822
JULIUS:
No further questions.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.337
CANNING:
First, let me
start by saying

27:54.370 --> 27:57.430
how sorry I am about your recent
medical developments.

27:57.470 --> 28:00.405
If I can offer some advice
from personal experience:

28:00.440 --> 28:02.305
one day at a time.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.944
GRANT:
Thank you.

28:03.980 --> 28:07.143
So this baseline test
the doctor gave you

28:07.180 --> 28:09.740
at the start of the season--
did you fake yours?

28:10.850 --> 28:12.317
GRANT:
Uh...

28:12.350 --> 28:13.886
did-did I...?

28:13.920 --> 28:15.478
I'm-I-I don't...

28:15.520 --> 28:16.555
I'm not sure
I understand...

28:16.590 --> 28:18.820
Weren't you told by a teammate
to fake the test?

28:18.860 --> 28:20.896
You know, tap on the
keyboard a little slower

28:20.930 --> 28:23.455
or mix up the numbers
on the test grid.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.422
That way, if you suffered
a head injury during a game,

28:25.470 --> 28:27.392
the_team doctors would see
Similar results and clear you

28:27.430 --> 28:28.397
to play.
Objection.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.498
Hearsay.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.939
CANNING:
My apologies,
Your Honor.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.232
I should have
submitted this

28:32.270 --> 28:34.431
evidence deposition
from one Anthony Murillo,

28:34.480 --> 28:36.778
who was Mr. Duverney's roommate
during his rookie season.

28:36.810 --> 28:37.902
Mr. Duverney,

28:37.950 --> 28:39.508
one more time.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.347
Did you fake your baseline test?

28:48.120 --> 28:49.417
Yes.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.451
CANNING:
So, if you hadn't
faked your test,

28:51.490 --> 28:53.128
they would have been
able to diagnose you

28:53.160 --> 28:54.320
and treat you
properly.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.850
Objection--
beyond the witness's expertise.

28:55.900 --> 28:56.798
Withdrawn.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.366
No... no further questions,
Your Honor.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.188
Grant, why did you fake
your baseline test?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.800
For the same reason
a lot of players do:

29:04.840 --> 29:07.365
I was afraid of losing my job.

29:07.410 --> 29:08.809
What are you doing right now?

29:08.840 --> 29:10.535
Diane has me on something.
What do you need?

29:10.580 --> 29:13.401
How quickly can you upload
a video online?

29:13.450 --> 29:15.077
No fingerprints.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.218
(keyless lock chirps)

29:19.250 --> 29:21.354
CANNING:
Mrs. Florrick.

29:21.390 --> 29:24.484
My driver is still
at the dentist.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.054
Can I get a lift?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.028
How much flexibility
is there?

29:33.070 --> 29:34.799
Well, we offer
telecommuting.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.262
And then there's
day care at work.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.392
No, uh,

29:37.440 --> 29:38.862
I have an issue.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.468
My apartment has gone condo,

29:40.510 --> 29:42.876
and I have the possibility
of purchasing a house.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.003
And you need money
for the down payment?

29:45.050 --> 29:47.848
Yes, and a consistent
higher level in pay.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.371
I have private tuition, and I'm
trying to save for college.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.445
I'll work up an offer.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.584
No. No, I'm fine.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.894
Clearly, you're not fine,
or we wouldn't be sitting here.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.557
Mr. Canning,
seriously, I'm fine.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.067
All right,
let's leave it at this.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.567
I'll work up an offer.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.919
You'll think about it.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.835
We'll talk on the phone later.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.168
And that's it-- no pressure.

30:12.970 --> 30:15.575
Nobody's doing anything
wrong here, Alicia.

30:15.610 --> 30:18.306
This is how America works.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.316
(whistle blows)

30:21.350 --> 30:23.841
(heavy metal playing)

30:28.460 --> 30:29.950
ALICIA:
So you're familiar

30:29.990 --> 30:31.218
with this Web site?

30:31.260 --> 30:32.522
Yes. RinkFights.com.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.619
It's not sanctioned
by our league.

30:34.660 --> 30:36.628
Well, then, you're aware
that it lets fans vote

30:36.660 --> 30:38.161
on who will win the fight,

30:38.200 --> 30:40.464
that the players
actually have fight cards

30:40.500 --> 30:42.866
with win-loss records?
Yes.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.607
As APHL's chief
administrative officer,

30:45.640 --> 30:48.200
you have the final say
over league copyright issues,

30:48.240 --> 30:49.639
correct?
I do.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.604
The clips the Web site plays
are game broadcasts.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.072
Do you grant them permission
to use these?

30:54.120 --> 30:55.178
Absolutely not.

30:55.220 --> 30:58.587
As I said, this is not
an APHL-sanctioned Web site.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.588
Let's talk about another
Web site that uses your clips.

31:00.620 --> 31:01.985
(crowd cheering)

31:02.020 --> 31:03.282
ALICIA:
This is a recent

31:03.320 --> 31:04.628
Boston-Detroit game.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.059
It was posted
online yesterday

31:06.090 --> 31:07.921
by an employee
of our firm.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.554
Do you know how long it took
the Webmaster to receive

31:10.600 --> 31:12.420
a cease and desist order
from your office?

31:12.470 --> 31:13.596
No.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.234
Two hours.

31:15.270 --> 31:17.067
In the eight years
since RinkFights.com

31:17.100 --> 31:19.034
has been online,
how many

31:19.070 --> 31:22.130
cease and_desist letters
have you issued them?

31:22.180 --> 31:23.579
None.

31:23.610 --> 31:25.248
ALICIA:
Is that because
you encourage

31:25.280 --> 31:27.145
fans' enthusiasm
for fights?

31:27.180 --> 31:28.909
No, of course not.
Then why aren't you

31:28.950 --> 31:30.349
removing
these fight videos?

31:30.380 --> 31:32.211
Well, I guess we'll start.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.512
Thank you for the
encouragement.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.586
And thank you
for that damaging testimony.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.655
Objection.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.487
Sustained.

31:47.130 --> 31:49.269
I think we should all
have a little sit-down.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.938
About?

31:50.970 --> 31:53.234
Me helping you win this thing.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.617
The truth--
are you in bed with him?

32:03.380 --> 32:05.211
Am I in bed with him?

32:05.250 --> 32:07.684
Yeah. That's what I've been
hearing from unnamed sources.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.951
I can neither confirm nor deny
that we have

32:10.990 --> 32:13.652
any formal agreement
with Frank Michael Thomas.

32:13.690 --> 32:17.968
And you don't think suits
like yours and Mr. Thomas's

32:18.000 --> 32:19.729
will hurt the sport
of ice hockey?

32:19.770 --> 32:21.692
No. Is fighting essential
to the sport of ice hockey?

32:21.740 --> 32:23.264
Some think it's a safety valve.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.006
Without it,
you'd see a lot more sticks

32:25.040 --> 32:26.701
swinging out there.
Not in college hockey.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.628
Not in the Olympics.
You would get ejected.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.705
But aren't the stakes
a little higher in the pros?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.139
Players' livelihoods
are on the line.

32:32.180 --> 32:34.011
Then why are there
no real fights

32:34.050 --> 32:35.369
during the championship series?

32:37.780 --> 32:39.680
Sounds like your
closing argument.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.711
Thanks.
No problem.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.729
If you need any more,
you should talk to Julius.

32:46.730 --> 32:48.049
So you were in London, right?

32:48.100 --> 32:50.125
Setting up
your magazine's operation

32:50.160 --> 32:51.593
for the Olympics?

32:51.630 --> 32:53.063
Yes.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.658
How was it?

32:54.700 --> 32:58.704
Rainy. You slept with Will
after I left town, didn't you?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.473
I promise you

33:02.510 --> 33:03.738
he didn't tell me.

33:03.780 --> 33:05.668
Will didn't put up
much of a fight

33:05.710 --> 33:08.372
when I told him
about the London offer.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.548
And then I e-mailed
him right after I got
there, but no response.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.478
I chalked it up to
his being so busy,

33:13.520 --> 33:15.158
but Will never
not responds.

33:15.190 --> 33:19.229
I knew you two
had history, so...

33:19.260 --> 33:21.296
two plus two.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.169
I think that's a conversation
you should have With Will.

33:30.700 --> 33:31.701
You're right.

33:31.740 --> 33:33.503
Inappropriate of me.

33:34.840 --> 33:35.875
You know,

33:35.910 --> 33:39.539
for the record, it wasn't over
between Will and I

33:39.580 --> 33:41.548
when I left for London.

33:41.580 --> 33:44.344
Then you slept with him,
and it was over.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.675
We appreciate
the change of heart.

34:09.710 --> 34:12.543
We could use whatever
help you can give us.

34:12.580 --> 34:15.413
Shouldn't we wait
for Ms. Lockhart

34:15.450 --> 34:16.712
before getting
to brass tacks?

34:16.750 --> 34:17.842
I understood
she was gonna

34:17.880 --> 34:19.381
be a part of this.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.718
Diane got pulled away
on another case.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.354
But we'll bring her
up to speed.
So be it.

34:24.390 --> 34:27.188
Don't look at this

34:27.230 --> 34:29.790
as a benevolent gesture--
I just think you folks did

34:29.830 --> 34:31.866
a hell of a job
in court today,

34:31.900 --> 34:35.336
and it looks like helping
you might actually
help me after all.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.759
Um, I'm sorry, would
you excuse me, please?

34:37.800 --> 34:39.131
Of course.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.638
Now, you just
promise me this--

34:41.680 --> 34:43.773
when you use this
against Louis Canning,

34:43.810 --> 34:47.075
try to draw blood.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.618
We're adding a witness,
Dr. Andr Wedd.

34:50.650 --> 34:53.210
And you're telling me
in accordance to court rules.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.457
Very honorable of you.
Dr. Wedd is a
neurologist...

34:55.490 --> 34:56.809
Who has repeatedly
lambasted the league

34:56.860 --> 34:58.555
for its approach
to head injuries.

34:58.590 --> 34:59.887
I've read
all his articles.

34:59.930 --> 35:02.125
He has a unique gift
for repeating himself.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.058
What Dr. Wedd is

35:03.100 --> 35:04.863
testifying to isn't in
any of his articles.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.458
Really?

35:06.500 --> 35:08.138
Dr. Wedd approached
theleague

35:08.170 --> 35:10.161
with a rigorous protocol
for evaluating and treating

35:10.200 --> 35:11.838
players with
head injuries--

35:11.870 --> 35:15.135
one that wouldn't _scare
players into faking
baseline tests.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.831
Had the league not dismissed
Dr. Wedd so quickly,

35:17.880 --> 35:21.270
Grant Duverney would
have been properly
diagnosed and treated.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.345
I can show you the
rejection e-mail

35:23.380 --> 35:25.780
that Dr. Wedd received
from the league VP.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.811
It's a quick read.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.749
I'll run it by the league,

35:34.800 --> 35:36.153
Oh.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.191
One more thing.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.697
You have 24 hours.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.763
DIANE:
Fishing?

35:47.810 --> 35:48.879
McVEIGH:
At Horsetail Lake.

35:48.910 --> 35:50.434
It's an easy drive
from the city.

35:50.480 --> 35:51.947
We'd make it a day trip.

35:51.980 --> 35:52.878
Kurt, have we met?

35:52.910 --> 35:54.411
I'll do all the baiting.

35:54.450 --> 35:55.872
Oh, would you
have it any other way?

35:55.920 --> 35:57.649
We pack a lunch,
we rent a boat,

35:57.680 --> 35:59.443
and we breathe something
other than car exhaust

35:59.490 --> 36:01.651
for a few hours,
and the good news for you--

36:01.690 --> 36:02.952
cell phone coverage.

36:02.990 --> 36:05.458
(phone rings)
(laughs)
Hold on a second.

36:05.490 --> 36:07.287
JACK:
You don't hate me,
Hello?

36:07.330 --> 36:09.298
right?

36:09.330 --> 36:10.957
Uh, Jack?

36:11.000 --> 36:11.819
Uh, hello.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.338
I said I'd take you out
some other time,

36:14.370 --> 36:17.635
so I'm calling
to find out that other time.

36:17.670 --> 36:18.967
Uh... when do you

36:19.010 --> 36:19.965
have in mind?

36:20.010 --> 36:21.477
I was thinking Friday night.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.909
Unwind after work.

36:22.940 --> 36:26.671
I, uh... Can you
hold on a second?

36:26.710 --> 36:27.802
Kurt?

36:27.850 --> 36:29.670
No, Jack.
Oh, hold on a second.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.812
Um...

36:30.850 --> 36:31.782
Who's Kurt?

36:31.820 --> 36:34.880
He's j... he's just
a-a business associate.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.480
Uh, I-I will be
right back, uh...

36:37.520 --> 36:39.351
Jack.
Jack. Hold on.

36:39.390 --> 36:41.551
Hello?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.659
Look, if Horsetail Lake
doesn't cut it for you, then...

36:43.700 --> 36:44.860
No, no, no. It sounds fun.

36:44.900 --> 36:47.562
When were you... thinking?

36:47.600 --> 36:49.830
Saturday morning.
Pick you up at 8:00.

36:49.870 --> 36:53.533
Perfect.
I will see you then. Bye.

36:53.570 --> 36:54.776
Still there?

36:54.810 --> 36:56.334
Yep.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.870
Friday night sounds good.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.345
ELI:
It's pretty darn hard

37:03.380 --> 37:05.644
being on the outside
looking in, huh?

37:05.690 --> 37:08.955
I'm just sitting here watching
the wheels turn round and round.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.958
What do you need, Eli?

37:10.990 --> 37:13.481
I did not leak to the
disciplinary board.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.657
But you're gonna
tell me who did?

37:15.700 --> 37:16.997
I can tell you
my suspicions.

37:17.030 --> 37:19.294
David Lee.
Yup.

37:19.330 --> 37:20.866
(quiet chuckle)
That's funny.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.561
David Lee was
in here yesterday

37:22.600 --> 37:24.830
saying you leaked it.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.906
He did not.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.476
He did.
No.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.307
No, you're playing us
against each other.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.306
As long as we're
fighting each other,

37:33.350 --> 37:34.612
you're safe.

37:34.650 --> 37:38.484
I don't think
I'll ever be... safe.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.647
It's good talking
to you, Eli.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.326
Excuse me, Diane?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.661
Uh, yes, Alicia?

37:54.070 --> 37:56.664
I have received
a formal job offer

37:56.700 --> 37:58.565
from Louis Canning.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.032
From Canning?

38:00.070 --> 38:02.607
He approached me
several months ago
and I declined,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.403
but he's been persistent.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.747
And you're considering it?

38:05.780 --> 38:07.873
I'd like to stay,
but his offer...

38:07.910 --> 38:09.969
would go a long way
to helping me

38:10.020 --> 38:12.318
cover a mortgage payment.
It wasn't Louis Canning

38:12.350 --> 38:15.888
who gave you a chance after
13 years away from the law.

38:19.390 --> 38:20.880
This is his offer.

38:20.930 --> 38:22.625
If I stay at the firm,

38:22.660 --> 38:24.821
it has to be more.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.463
You'll give me till
the end ON the week?
0.

38:32.510 --> 38:35.308
I can't.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.504
Yep, everybody changes.

38:39.550 --> 38:43.509
End of the week, Alicia,
or you can clean out
your desk right now.

38:52.430 --> 38:55.524
You've heard nothing?
No text, no e-mail, nothing.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.858
I would've thought Canning
would want to end this,

38:57.900 --> 39:00.664
keep the league from
getting skewered in court.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.930
Fine, put Dr. Wedd
on the stand.
Mr. Cain,

39:02.970 --> 39:05.359
do you have a minute?
Can it wait until
after court?

39:05.410 --> 39:07.037
There is no court.

39:07.070 --> 39:08.970
I just spoke
to Judge Rigby.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.604
The Snow Plain Corporation
has reevaluated its position

39:11.650 --> 39:13.106
on the original case.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.845
We're now prepared to settle.

39:14.880 --> 39:18.418
W-Well, we're way beyond
that point, Mr. Hines.

39:18.450 --> 39:21.010
The only acceptable number
is the full $5 million.

39:21.050 --> 39:24.110
Good. Because that's
what we're offering.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.049
Talk to your client
and let me know.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.491
What just happened?

39:32.530 --> 39:35.966
I think we just won.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.139
(loud, overlapping chatter)

39:38.170 --> 39:40.707
No! No, no, no, no!

39:40.740 --> 39:41.775
No bonus!

39:41.810 --> 39:43.129
She just won
a case.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.705
Alicia did not
Win a case--
she was handed

39:45.750 --> 39:47.877
a settlement.
Which we wouldn't have gotten
but for her performance.

39:47.910 --> 39:50.140
Oh, forgive me, Miyagi,
I forgot who was guiding Alicia.

39:50.180 --> 39:53.684
And since when do you have
a problem with winning
money for clients?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.415
Oh, who cares
about the client! Will!

39:55.460 --> 39:57.155
Tell them how disastrous
it would be if Alicia walks.

39:57.190 --> 39:58.851
JULIUS:
I don't care
what she's paid.

39:58.890 --> 40:01.529
I just can't afford to lose
another body right now.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.788
Look, we all
know the issue.

40:02.830 --> 40:05.162
Why don't we just
put it to a vote.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.498
All those in favor.
No.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.465
She's getting her bonus.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.434
I'm invoking
managing-partner prerogative.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.199
You can't be serious.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.708
Mm, what are we talking about?
WILL:
The firm's bylaws

40:16.740 --> 40:18.947
allow the managing partner
to act unilaterally.

40:18.980 --> 40:20.504
Under extenuating
circumstances.

40:20.550 --> 40:22.142
We must have
missed the memo.

40:22.180 --> 40:24.614
Apparently, we're now
Stalin & Associates.

40:24.650 --> 40:26.584
Well, if it means
Alicia sticks around,

40:26.620 --> 40:27.917
I second it.
You can't second it.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.451
The matter is closed.

40:29.490 --> 40:31.958
Any other business?

40:35.960 --> 40:38.895
You just stuck your neck out
for a third-year associate.

40:38.930 --> 40:41.194
Your suspension has
left us exposed.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.768
I stuck my neck out for
the future of this firm.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.766
Hi.

40:46.810 --> 40:51.509
(chuckles) I'm not sure what
time I can get out tonight.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.541
(laughing)

40:56.120 --> 40:59.248
(muffled talking)

40:59.290 --> 41:01.679
(laughing)

41:03.820 --> 41:05.959
But thank you very
much, Mr. Canning.

41:08.290 --> 41:10.497
Is something wrong?

41:11.700 --> 41:13.122
You used me.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.195
No.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.800
The firm made it attractive
for me to stay.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.809
It was unexpected.
Unexpected as
a knife in the back.

41:23.010 --> 41:24.898
Y... You should
still be pleased.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.770
You did well for your client.

41:26.810 --> 41:28.812
Whatever deal you
cut with Snow Plain

41:28.850 --> 41:30.875
deflects any liability
away from the league.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.012
No, I'm pleased--

41:32.050 --> 41:34.587
because I needed to smoke
Frank Michael Thomas out,

41:34.620 --> 41:36.759
find out what he had
for his class action.

41:36.790 --> 41:39.179
And thanks to your good
lawyering, now I know,

41:39.230 --> 41:40.879
and I'll be
ready for him.

41:40.930 --> 41:43.751
So I guess what I want
to say to you, Alicia,

41:43.800 --> 41:45.199
is thank you.

41:45.230 --> 41:46.720
Thank you.

41:52.070 --> 41:53.901
(quiet sigh)

41:56.610 --> 41:59.704
Anything you have
would be really helpful.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.103
Okay. Okay, good.

42:01.150 --> 42:02.777
Thanks.

42:04.950 --> 42:07.817
The other day when
you brought the beer,

42:07.850 --> 42:10.057
I wasn't...
It's all right.

42:10.090 --> 42:11.819
They were warm, aanay.

42:13.690 --> 42:14.952
(sighs)

42:15.000 --> 42:17.651
Look, I can't go back
to the way it was before.

42:17.700 --> 42:18.928
There's just been too much.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.791
I know.

42:21.840 --> 42:22.932
But...

42:22.970 --> 42:26.303
I'd like to try
to make it work.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.245
It's just that everything...

42:32.280 --> 42:34.305
it has to be...

42:34.350 --> 42:35.942
on the table.

42:35.980 --> 42:39.643
I can't be the only
one being forthcoming.

42:39.690 --> 42:43.182
I can't be the only
one being honest.

42:44.220 --> 42:46.825
Can... you do that?

42:49.630 --> 42:51.052
Yeah.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.895
Okay.

42:57.070 --> 43:00.130
I'll see you tomorrow.
