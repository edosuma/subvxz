01:20.873 --> 01:23.250
- What's up, boy?

01:23.334 --> 01:25.461
- What you doin' here, Silk?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.215
- Figured it might be
a good time, you know,

01:29.298 --> 01:30.508
for me to pay my tithes.

01:36.222 --> 01:37.556
Come on, man.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.017
Look, look, my sister already
told me the organ's busted.

01:41.644 --> 01:43.354
Come on, man.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.730
Just trying to pay my tithes.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.902
- You don't ever do anything

01:49.985 --> 01:52.404
unless it got something
to do with you.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.781
- Come on, man.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.744
No, no, no, seriously,
it's for the church, man.

01:56.826 --> 02:00.913
You give me something,
I give you something.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.792
- What's your game?

02:07.586 --> 02:08.878
- I ain't got no game.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.301
Just wanna give
this to the church.

02:17.555 --> 02:18.764
- What do you get out of it?

02:24.562 --> 02:26.480
- I want you to
cover me in prayer.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.736
That's it.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.530
- That's all you want?

02:34.613 --> 02:35.613
To be covered in prayer?

02:35.656 --> 02:36.699
- That's it, that's all.

02:38.409 --> 02:39.952
I want you to
cover me in prayer.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.289
Sinners need prayer, too.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.392
Bow my head, I close my eyes,

03:03.475 --> 03:06.645
you put your hand on my
shoulder or somethin', what?

03:06.729 --> 03:07.980
Come on, let's go.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.440
- You wanna be covered?

03:10.691 --> 03:11.811
- Yeah, that's right.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.157
- Cover yourself.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.240
- What?

03:20.200 --> 03:24.705
Proverbs 13:22.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.499
"And all the wealth of the
sinners will be stored up

03:29.543 --> 03:30.920
"for the righteous."

03:36.008 --> 03:37.635
- Take care, Silk.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.404
- You know, I love what
you did with the place,

03:39.428 --> 03:40.679
you know what I'm sayin'?

03:40.763 --> 03:41.764
It's kinda cool.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.266
I like the car, too.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.896
You should come work for me.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.315
Tellin' you, I could
put a thousand dollars

03:51.398 --> 03:53.442
in your pocket a
week, even more.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.320
Yeah, even more.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.364
This place needs it.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.549
- You know I don't do that.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.449
- I love the minivan.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.700
It looks good on you, too.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.410
Reliable.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.329
Safe.

04:06.956 --> 04:07.956
Economic.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.574
- Hey baby.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.043
I went to the church again.

05:40.799 --> 05:41.799
I'm not ready.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.433
You know, L.J. and Sandra
keep trying to get me

05:49.516 --> 05:50.809
to go up in there, but...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.065
It's not the same without you.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.885
You know I was
thinking the other day,

06:06.909 --> 06:08.229
maybe I should sit
down and write.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.306
I been talking to
these different people

06:11.330 --> 06:12.456
about survivor's guilt.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.251
So many folks out there.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.713
I won't light it,
I won't light it.

06:32.768 --> 06:33.811
I see you in my dreams.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.857
Baby is alive.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.360
The three of us are happy.

06:49.535 --> 06:50.953
- God, God, yessir, yessir.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.647
Let me tell you
something, Preacher.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.876
You sure enough preached
that thing today, boy.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.254
- They um, they
really seemed like

07:00.337 --> 07:01.588
they was into it today.

07:01.672 --> 07:02.798
- Amen, amen.

07:05.008 --> 07:05.676
- Praise God.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.510
- Hey.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.593
Monies for the day.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.021
- A whole $120?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.982
- Yeah, the whole $120.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.961
Look here, don't go spending
that all in one place.

07:22.985 --> 07:24.185
- Where I'm gonna spend it at?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.028
$120.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.325
- Well, you know you
can give it back to me.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.994
- Don't you play with
the Lord's money.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.246
- Man.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.961
Well, how's everything
going out there?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.254
- Everything's good, man.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.674
Well, you heard
the organ, right?

07:45.757 --> 07:46.860
- Yeah, I wanted to
ask you about that,

07:46.884 --> 07:48.319
'cause it sound like
an old dyin' cat.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.343
- Yeah.

07:50.429 --> 07:54.057
A dying cat that died twice.

07:54.141 --> 07:54.975
- Ooh.

07:55.058 --> 07:55.893
What's going on with it?

07:55.976 --> 07:56.810
- Yeah that thing's dead.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.437
The organ is gone, it's dead.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.647
Yeah, we gonna need a new
one of those, for sure,

08:00.731 --> 08:01.958
but if we don't increase
our tithes and offering,

08:01.982 --> 08:05.444
I mean, we might have to
shut down our pantry box...

08:05.527 --> 08:06.445
- No, no, no.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.839
Lavar, we can't do that
because if we do that,

08:07.863 --> 08:09.423
then the summer camp's
gonna suffer man.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.532
- I know, I know.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.034
I was looking forward
to that event.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.873
- We gonna need
that miracle soon.

08:17.956 --> 08:18.956
- Indeed.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.253
- But is there any good news?

08:23.337 --> 08:24.504
- Yeah, yeah.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.424
We fed over 100 homeless
people this morning.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.385
- Your work, praise God.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.474
Now, next time, you might
wanna lead with that.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.475
- With that one?

08:36.558 --> 08:37.308
- Yeah, with that one, right.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.309
- I got you.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.102
- With that particular one.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.062
- Gotcha, copy, copy.

08:40.145 --> 08:40.979
- Bring the confidence up.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.222
- I understand, I understand.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.148
I got your back.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.399
- Alright.

08:44.483 --> 08:45.752
- Look here man, I'm gonna
get up on outta here.

08:45.776 --> 08:46.985
- Go on, go ahead, alright.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.362
- Alright, mother?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.923
I'm gonna take that box on
over to Mother Carey's, okay?

08:49.947 --> 08:51.007
- No, no, you ain't
gotta worry about it.

08:51.031 --> 08:51.740
I'll take it over there.

08:51.823 --> 08:52.532
- You sure?

08:52.616 --> 08:53.283
- Yeah, I'm sure.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.201
- You don't mind?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.452
- No, I'm good, go ahead.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.411
- Alright, see ya tomorrow.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.704
- See ya tomorrow.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.831
See ya tomorrow

08:59.915 --> 09:02.584
- We gonna pray on
that miracle, too.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.046
- Go on, head on outta here.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.298
He can only bless so many
things, so many things.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.716
- He's still working with me.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.928
- Get on outta here.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.011
- Hey, Pastor.

09:15.013 --> 09:15.889
Let me hold something.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.724
- Get out.

09:17.808 --> 09:18.976
Get out, get out.

09:21.228 --> 09:21.937
- See ya tomorrow, man.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.021
- Go on, Levar.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.510
- Mama, you could
probably see better

09:35.534 --> 09:36.660
if you took your shades off.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.954
- Girl, I forgot my glasses.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.373
Thank you so much.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.666
- Take this...

09:42.749 --> 09:43.583
- No, no, no, I got this.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.501
Your money is no good here.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.836
- Okay, thank you, Mama.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.213
- Plus you know, I got these
papers I want you to look at.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.172
- Okay.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.132
- You know, from
Social Security.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.455
They make these things so hard.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.677
- Well, you might wanna
clean out your purse.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.305
- Well, so how much is it?

09:56.388 --> 09:57.014
How much do I owe you?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.474
- I thought you said
you forgot your glasses?

09:59.558 --> 10:02.060
- You know how forgetful I am.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.604
How much do I owe you?

10:04.688 --> 10:06.106
- Mama, take off your shades.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.024
- No, I think I really...

10:07.107 --> 10:08.984
- Mama, take off, take them off!

10:12.946 --> 10:13.655
- It's just a little...

10:13.739 --> 10:14.948
- A little what?

10:15.032 --> 10:15.699
What, what?

10:15.782 --> 10:16.658
He didn't mean to?

10:16.742 --> 10:17.659
That's what you always say!

10:17.743 --> 10:18.952
- Keep your voice down!

10:19.036 --> 10:21.163
You're puttin' my
business in the street!

10:21.246 --> 10:22.246
Sandra!

10:28.170 --> 10:29.212
- Mama Carey?

10:33.342 --> 10:36.762
Pastor, what you doin' here?

10:36.845 --> 10:37.947
- You know, I needed to
come and check on you

10:37.971 --> 10:39.198
and bring you a little
care package here.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.140
- Come on in.

10:40.223 --> 10:40.891
- Alright.

10:40.974 --> 10:41.975
- Have some lemonade.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.060
- That sounds good.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.143
Alright.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.400
Close the door here.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.235
- Yeah, you come on in here.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.653
I'll tell you what.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.030
- Yes ma'am.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.491
- I'm gonna pour you a nice,
tall glass of lemonade.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.992
- Ooh, that sounds good.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.118
It's hot out there.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.220
- It is hot out there.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.287
- Yes ma'am.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.639
I'm gonna go ahead and put
this up for you, alright?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.581

11:05.957 --> 11:07.677
Gonna make sure that
you are good and you...

11:12.172 --> 11:14.257
- I know.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.426
- That's alright.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.929
- I'll be glad when
the season change

11:19.012 --> 11:20.889
and we get a little
relief from this...

11:20.972 --> 11:22.557
- Well, it cooled
down a little bit.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.101
- Heat now.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.936
- But I wanted to make
sure I saw you before

11:26.019 --> 11:28.980
I went home for the night,

11:29.064 --> 11:30.690
just make sure
everything was alright.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.446
That's some good lemonade.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.406
- Thank you.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.573
- That's good.

11:38.657 --> 11:39.866
- Let me see.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.451
- That is good, Mama Carey.

11:43.078 --> 11:47.165
- Well, little bit too
much lemon for my taste.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.709
- Too much lemon
in it for your taste?

11:50.627 --> 11:52.087
- I can do better than this.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.048
- Well, I'll tell you what.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.134
I'm going back to the
church, get you another box

11:57.217 --> 12:00.679
and then we can have some
more lemonade when I get back.

12:01.847 --> 12:02.722
- Okay.

12:02.806 --> 12:03.974
- Yes ma'am.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.600
And while you gone,
I'm gonna make us

12:05.684 --> 12:06.935

12:07.018 --> 12:08.246
- Alright,

12:08.270 --> 12:09.479
- Alright.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.957
- Alright, I'll
see you in a minute, alright?

12:10.981 --> 12:12.125
- Alright, darling, thank you.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.149
- Alright.

12:17.028 --> 12:20.157

of samples in here for you,

12:21.283 --> 12:24.077

alright, there we go.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.248

12:29.291 --> 12:30.000
Thank you so much.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.251
- You're welcome.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.645
Thank you for shopping at the.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.688

12:33.712 --> 12:34.712
- Bye, you too.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.466
Thank you.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.009
- Girl another sale?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.802
You are on fire.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.262
This just might work.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.430
- Yes, I'm feeling it.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.657
I'm feeling pretty hot today.

12:44.681 --> 12:45.681
- You are?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.352
Hey, I forgot to ask you,

12:49.436 --> 12:50.896
how was lunch with your mom?

12:52.189 --> 12:55.650
- You know, um, I really
don't wanna talk about that,

12:55.734 --> 12:58.820
but it's alright, 'cause
the concert tonight

13:11.875 --> 13:13.769

13:56.836 --> 13:58.296
Wow, look at him, folks.

The champ's making his way back.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.300
What's happening man?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.530
That's an interesting
choice in supplement there.

14:22.737 --> 14:27.701

14:28.577 --> 14:30.161
a friend of hers from work.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.405
You remember Sheila from the
birthday party, don't you?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.169
- Yeah.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.973
- Yeah, I'm worried
about you if you didn't.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.216
- Long as you and Sandra
don't run off somewhere.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.885
- Nobody's trying to
hook you up, I swear it.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.388
Plus my attention's gonna
be on the show, anyway.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.266
- The attention needs
to be on your wife.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.560
- Don't worry about it.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.147
- Let me ask you a question.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.230
- This is good.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.527

Why, you got somewhere to be?

16:24.275 --> 16:25.318
- Alright.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.865
- Something on your mind?

16:33.535 --> 16:35.286
- How long we go back?

16:35.370 --> 16:37.122
- Come on, Levar, I'm tired now.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.165
- Just answer the question, man.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.019
- Well, if I gotta answer,

16:42.043 --> 16:44.087

Man Jones hairline.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.466
- That's right, that's right.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.051
Never too late, never too soon.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.595
- Brothers from
the womb to the tomb.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.016
- Yeah, I'm just saying anybody
who knows you knows that

16:58.309 --> 16:59.561
I was there, man, you know?

16:59.644 --> 17:01.855
From the running and the
hustling, I was right there.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.398
I done seen all that shh...

17:03.481 --> 17:04.481
- Whoa, hold on.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.523

17:05.567 --> 17:07.359
- Hold on,
watch yourself, brother.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.523
- You know what I'm saying.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.201
Long way, I mean, think about,

17:15.285 --> 17:18.204
you remember that time
when you left your drink

17:18.288 --> 17:20.707
on the table and somebody
spiked it with something?

17:22.666 --> 17:24.877
Man, before we knew it,
you were picking a fight

17:24.961 --> 17:25.627
with the bouncer.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.255
He put all outta there.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.967
- Yeah, yeah not one of my
finer moments, you know?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.385
I'm glad I don't remember it.

17:33.762 --> 17:34.846
- Yeah, well.

17:36.306 --> 17:39.517
We did a lot of childish
things back then.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.566
I know you didn't come
all the way in here now

17:46.649 --> 17:48.568
to just take a stroll
down memory lane?

17:49.652 --> 17:51.529
What's on your mind?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.990
- It's like this, you know.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.470
What you do on your personal
time is your personal business.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.721
- The plane, land it
Levar, land the plane.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.288
- Alright, one of
those childish things

18:00.371 --> 18:03.833
that we were supposed to
put away when we became men,

18:03.917 --> 18:05.251
is out in the parking lot.

18:17.096 --> 18:17.764
- Yo, stop fidgeting man.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.140
Why you moving so much?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.353

18:24.354 --> 18:27.649
Man, you been acting real
funny since Big Boy's funeral.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.286

trust me, alright?

18:41.079 --> 18:42.455
- Hold up, hold up.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.685
There's like, $10,000
in here, what's this?

18:46.709 --> 18:48.294
- I know, I know.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.505
- So where did it come from?

18:52.757 --> 18:53.757
I don't wanna know.

18:55.510 --> 18:56.928
- Levar, look.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.056
You know me, you know me.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.935
I need you to trust
me on this, alright?

19:04.018 --> 19:05.770
It's not what you think.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.397
It's not what you think.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.023
- So what you want
me to do, man?

19:13.945 --> 19:15.488
- Buy a new organ, alright?

19:15.572 --> 19:18.575
And then take whatever's
left, put half of it

19:18.658 --> 19:20.451

19:20.535 --> 19:22.078
on the summer camp
program, alright?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.246
Just take care of it.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.719
- What I should
do with my piece,

19:37.802 --> 19:40.471
no, no, no, tell me, tell me.

19:40.555 --> 19:41.890
Tell me what I need to do,

19:42.849 --> 19:44.684
since you got so much to say.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.810
- I'm just gonna be quiet.

19:45.894 --> 19:46.894
- What?

19:48.104 --> 19:50.732
'Cause that's the side I
like in you, the quiet side.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.401
Keep it that way.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.618
- Where your boy?

20:06.664 --> 20:07.790
- Hold my cigar.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.225
- Well?

21:00.843 --> 21:01.761
- You know what I'm saying?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.346
That's how I paid in the church.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.782
You know, they'll get
up and they'll ask

21:04.806 --> 21:05.807
for an offer and then...

21:05.890 --> 21:06.599
- Hey, sweet, we lucked out.

21:06.683 --> 21:07.558
It's a good table?

21:07.642 --> 21:09.852
- Yeah, it is, it's really good.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.062
- So you know what?

21:11.145 --> 21:12.480
It's time for a offering now.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.624
- Sheila, you ever
been here before?

21:13.648 --> 21:14.848
- I haven't but Sandra told me

21:14.899 --> 21:16.818
that the crab cakes
are off the chain.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.156
- They are, but I have
to stay away from shellfish.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.616
- Since when?

21:23.700 --> 21:25.052
- You don't remember
your conference?

21:25.076 --> 21:27.120
I had the shrimp and it
made my throat all itchy.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.948
- I thought that was peanuts.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.603
- Do you think I'm
making this all up?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.462
- I didn't say that.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.590
- Sandra, I have to go
freshen my lipstick.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.509
Will you come with me?

21:41.592 --> 21:43.094
Come on.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.364
- Must be something
in this church.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.390
He's saying alright, y'all.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.892
We just heard from the Lord.

21:49.976 --> 21:50.852
I said good night.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.103
I just heard from the deacon.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.398
He said I wanna let y'all know,

21:55.481 --> 21:57.650
we're gonna need
50 more dollars.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.814
And we ain't going nowhere.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.613
- What is wrong?

22:02.697 --> 22:03.698
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.450
It's just, all this
stuff that's going on

22:05.533 --> 22:08.494
with my mama, and I
just don't need him

22:08.578 --> 22:09.787
adding on to...

22:09.871 --> 22:11.664
- No, no, he is
a good man, okay?

22:11.748 --> 22:12.915
Be grateful.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.085
I'm in my prime and
I'm still looking.

22:16.169 --> 22:16.878
- You're right.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.129
- My goodness.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.840
Speaking of looking,
I don't remember Manny

22:20.923 --> 22:22.842
looking so fine.

22:25.803 --> 22:29.307
- Girl, stop, I'm serious.

22:29.390 --> 22:33.102
I'm just admiring his
handsomeness, that's all.

22:33.186 --> 22:36.814
- Well, I saw him
admiring something on you...

22:36.898 --> 22:38.066
- You know what?

22:39.901 --> 22:41.486
You are so silly.

22:48.785 --> 22:49.785
- Hey.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.500
- Sorry.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.712
- You're forgiven.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.547
And I didn't say anything
negative about you

23:01.631 --> 23:03.471
behind your back when
you went to the restroom.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.093
I really didn't
say anything, no.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.385
- Whatever.

23:06.469 --> 23:07.887
- Okay, maybe I
bitched a little.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.514
That's alright.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.432
- You know, I want
y'all commune with me

23:11.516 --> 23:13.643
when I ask you, I'm
gonna point at y'all,

23:13.726 --> 23:14.769
I want y'all to say,

23:14.852 --> 23:16.729

23:16.813 --> 23:19.732
And then I'm gonna tell you
why your church is ghetto.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.611
- You know your
church is ghetto.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.571
- When you get there,
you're passing out

23:25.655 --> 23:27.490
hobo grilling.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.745
- You know your
church is ghetto.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.580
- What you did to the
offering and I mean,

23:34.664 --> 23:35.904

23:35.957 --> 23:37.959

sitting in the front row.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.908
- We need to take a five
minute intermission.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.686
When we come back, we're
gonna hear from Sherel Riley.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.356
- So, Sheila,
did you enjoy the show?

24:00.439 --> 24:02.275
- I did.

24:02.358 --> 24:05.903
Good music, good

24:08.030 --> 24:10.449
- Absolutely, you

Got all his albums.

24:12.034 --> 24:12.869
- Me too.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.704
- Ooh, they got
something in common.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.538
Look at that.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.789
- That's right honey.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.058
I'm sorry, you'll have
to excuse my wife.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.878
She was a cupid or
something in a past life.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.171
- You know what?

24:23.254 --> 24:25.673
My mom would try to
fix me up for years,

24:25.756 --> 24:26.799
so I'm used to it, so...

24:26.883 --> 24:27.717
- Yeah?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.093
- Really, alright.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.513
- Do you guys want a lift?

24:32.597 --> 24:33.806
- No, I'm taking a cab.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.349
- Yeah, I Ubered here, so...

24:35.433 --> 24:37.894
- Well maybe you guys
can take a car together.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.520
Uber together.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.524

disrespect me in public again.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.705
- But baby, you told me to st...

24:57.788 --> 24:58.868

24:58.915 --> 24:59.624
- Well, I...

24:59.707 --> 25:00.416
- I do what I wanna do.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.500
- Okay, okay, okay.

25:01.584 --> 25:02.853
I understand, but that was
money for the grocery bill.

25:02.877 --> 25:03.711
- You get paid Friday.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.213
- But I am not the bank!

25:07.215 --> 25:08.049

25:08.132 --> 25:08.966

25:09.050 --> 25:09.717
You know what?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.010
I'll tell you what.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.362
- Take your hands off her.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.223
Take your hands off her.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.266
- My God, no wait, please.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.603
He's having a heart attack,
please call the police!

25:20.686 --> 25:21.938
Help!

25:22.021 --> 25:24.357
- So, nothing happened?

25:25.816 --> 25:27.526
- No, nothing.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.863
Why do you sound
so disappointed?

25:30.947 --> 25:32.549
- I mean, I woulda
thought you'd get like,

25:32.573 --> 25:34.075
a kiss on the
cheek or something.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.826
- I know, that would
have been kinda nice.

25:35.910 --> 25:36.619
- You see?

25:36.702 --> 25:38.079
Thank you.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.957
So, when are you
two going out again?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.750
- I don't know.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.294
I haven't talked to him, at all.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.712
- He hasn't called you?

25:46.796 --> 25:47.796
- No.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.800
- Okay, have you called him?

25:50.883 --> 25:52.969
- I tried, but he didn't answer.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.013
- Okay, okay, alright.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.224
You're gonna go over there.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.058
- What?

25:59.141 --> 26:00.351
- Yep.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.037
- That is gonna make
me look so desperate.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.061
- But you are.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.647
- You are not right!

26:05.648 --> 26:06.315
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.066
Sheila, I'm kidding.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.651
It's a joke, okay?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.403
But seriously, alright.

26:10.486 --> 26:13.781
Manny, he's just now getting
back to his old self.

26:13.864 --> 26:17.952
I mean, he went into seclusion
when he lost his family, so.

26:18.035 --> 26:21.372
- So, you're saying I should
just show up at his door?

26:21.455 --> 26:23.335
- I mean, I think that
you taking the initiative

26:23.374 --> 26:25.418
will show him that
he's safe with you.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.423
Yeah, yeah?

26:30.506 --> 26:33.718
- I don't wanna it to make
it seem like I'm chasing him.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.344
- But you aren't, right?

26:35.428 --> 26:37.388
This is different.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.598
- Come on.

26:41.392 --> 26:42.059
- Okay.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.019
- Yes!

26:43.102 --> 26:44.329
I'm gonna text you his address.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.898
Alright and let me
know when you have it.

26:49.025 --> 26:49.734
- Got it.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.068
- Cool.

26:52.069 --> 26:53.404
Alright, let's bless the food.

26:53.696 --> 26:55.507
Heavenly Father we come
to you saying thank you.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.950
Thank you for this day,
thank you for this business

26:58.034 --> 27:00.053
and thank you for this food
that we're about to receive

27:00.077 --> 27:03.122
and thank you that Sheila's
gonna go over to Manny's house.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.205
Amen.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.087
- I hate you.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.673
So hard.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.138
I just wanna be with my family.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.057
You took them!

27:21.140 --> 27:23.309
You took them from me!

27:36.572 --> 27:37.572
I'm coming.

27:44.038 --> 27:45.164
- Jesus.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.043
- What are you doin'?

27:51.462 --> 27:52.462
What are you looking for?

27:52.505 --> 27:53.547
- Nothing.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.633
Where'd you hide her?

27:55.716 --> 27:56.425
Where is she?

27:56.509 --> 27:57.301
- Who?

27:57.385 --> 27:58.385
- In here?

27:59.470 --> 28:01.263
- Who are you talking about?

28:01.347 --> 28:02.765
- How'd it go with Sheila?

28:04.308 --> 28:05.744
- Is that who
you're looking for?

28:05.768 --> 28:06.685
- You got any beer
in the fridge?

28:06.769 --> 28:08.020
- No.

28:08.104 --> 28:08.813
Yeah.

28:08.896 --> 28:09.896
- Yeah ya do.

28:11.065 --> 28:12.066
Jesus, boy.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.232
So, how'd it go with Sheila?

28:17.279 --> 28:18.279
- It went fine.

28:19.240 --> 28:19.949
You happy?

28:20.032 --> 28:21.242
Nothing happened.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.175
- Let me get a jag.

28:38.259 --> 28:39.343
Parked it down the street.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.600
You see the look on
that old man's face?

28:51.021 --> 28:53.023
- You think that's funny?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.146
- What's going on with you?

28:55.192 --> 28:57.570
First, you hanging
out with the Pastor,

28:57.653 --> 29:00.156
now you crying over a
old school that needed

29:00.239 --> 29:02.217
his head bashed in for
putting his hands on that...

29:02.241 --> 29:03.576
- Come on, man, we don't,

29:03.659 --> 29:04.410
we don't do it like that.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.578
- But that's what we do.

29:06.871 --> 29:07.788
What, you put a
pistol in his face,

29:07.872 --> 29:09.039
Catch the Holy Ghost?

29:09.123 --> 29:11.000
You think he's supposed to what?

29:13.377 --> 29:15.629
- If you think that's
how it goes down,

29:15.713 --> 29:17.298
maybe this ain't for me no more.

29:17.381 --> 29:18.549
- Naw, it's for you.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.134
What ain't for you
is that pastor.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.510
You drop him and we get goin'.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.345
- Let me tell you something.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.222
It come down to
that pastor or you,

29:26.307 --> 29:27.558
I'm picking that pastor.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.189
- Alright.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.316
Well, then maybe I
need to go down there

29:35.399 --> 29:39.153
and have a little man-to-man
conversation with that pastor,

29:39.236 --> 29:40.236
put some hands on him.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.073
- Let me tell you something.

29:43.157 --> 29:45.201
You don't go no where near him.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.871
You understand that?

29:48.954 --> 29:50.372
- Yeah, got you.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.717
Where my drink?

30:05.262 --> 30:07.139
What's funny?

30:07.223 --> 30:08.641
What's funny?

30:08.724 --> 30:09.725
- Hey.

30:57.398 --> 30:58.399
- Sheila.

30:58.482 --> 30:59.733
- Hi.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.127
- What are you doing here?

31:01.151 --> 31:02.420
- I was just in
the neighborhood,

31:02.444 --> 31:03.362
thought I might stop by.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.072
- Really?

31:05.155 --> 31:06.657
- Did I catch you at a bad time?

31:08.951 --> 31:09.951
- No.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.205
- Can I come in?

31:13.289 --> 31:14.289
- Absolutely.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.466
Hey let me take that for you.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.593
- Thank you.

31:25.676 --> 31:26.844
- That's so cool.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.238
I appreciate you
coming with food.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.306
- Thank you, I didn't
know you had company.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.389
- Hi Sheila.

31:31.432 --> 31:32.224
What a surprise.

31:32.308 --> 31:33.017
- No, no.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.893
He was just leaving.

31:34.977 --> 31:35.977
- I was?

31:36.020 --> 31:37.020
I thought we were...

31:39.773 --> 31:41.191
That's right.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.193
I have a thing,
it's very important.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.277
- Yeah, that thing.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.237
- I've got to get to a thing.

31:45.321 --> 31:46.548
- That thing, yeah, that
thing we talked about.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.406
Okay.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.240
- Yeah and my beer's finished,

31:48.324 --> 31:49.658
so I mean, it's perfect timing.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.577
- Yeah, got those things to do.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.330
- Alright, well don't do
anything I would do, okay?

31:54.413 --> 31:57.875
- You two, you two are pathetic.

31:59.293 --> 32:01.503
- Got to work on our
non-verbals, obviously.

32:04.381 --> 32:08.218
- I hope you haven't eaten yet.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.971
I wanted to whip you
up a little something.

32:11.055 --> 32:13.599
- I had a snack
earlier, but I can eat.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.017
It's very thoughtful of you.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.310
I mean, what's on the menu?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.936
- Well, salmon...

32:19.313 --> 32:20.522
- Salmon.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.816
- With a raspberry
chipotle glaze.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.360
- Alright.

32:24.443 --> 32:28.822
- Pan seared squash and
a fully loaded salad.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.157
- Well, well.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.995
Sounds too good to be true.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.455
I'm gonna go change.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.790
Kitchen is all yours.

32:37.873 --> 32:38.873
- Alright.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.712
Excuse me, excuse me.

32:43.796 --> 32:44.876
I'm looking for my husband.

32:44.922 --> 32:45.631
He just...

32:45.714 --> 32:46.423
- Mrs. Thomas?

32:46.507 --> 32:47.299
- Yes, yes, that's me.

32:47.383 --> 32:48.383
- I'm Dr. Freeman.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.134
- How is he?

32:49.218 --> 32:49.927
- Are you here alone?

32:50.010 --> 32:51.804
- Yes, yes, how is he?

32:51.887 --> 32:53.305
- We are prepping
him for surgery.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.475
I will be performing the
coronary artery bypass.

32:56.558 --> 32:57.685
He's has 90% blockage.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.980
I will try and repair
his heart valve to get

33:02.064 --> 33:03.565
an even flow back to his heart.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.942
- No.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.319
- The surgery should
take about four hours.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.588
You know, I know
it's gonna be hard,

33:08.612 --> 33:10.572
but try to get some rest.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.256
You know, if you have
anyone who can come

33:12.282 --> 33:15.119
and be with you, now is
a good time to call them.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.495
- Thank you, doctor.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.540
- I'll ask Joseph
to come and get you

33:19.623 --> 33:21.500
before we take him to
the operation room.

33:21.583 --> 33:22.876
- Thank you again, doctor.

33:22.960 --> 33:23.711
- He's in good hands.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.045
Okay, okay.

33:42.730 --> 33:43.730
- Pastor.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.443
Can I talk to you for a second?

33:51.447 --> 33:52.447
- Alright.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.962
I see some things never change.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.092
- I need you to do
something for me.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.472
- What is it?

34:16.554 --> 34:18.389
- I need you to cover
me in prayers again.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.228
- What you need, Silk?

34:23.312 --> 34:25.147
- Please, man, just cover
me in prayers again.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.446
I got to tell you something.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.114
- Go ahead.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.454
- I think I killed
this old man today.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.917
- Wait, you did what?

34:45.833 --> 34:51.297
- I mean, this old man was
beating up on his old lady,

34:51.380 --> 34:54.051
so I stepped in,
next thing I know,

34:55.260 --> 34:56.469
he's having a heart attack.

35:01.225 --> 35:04.520
- Do you know, are you
for sure that he's dead?

35:05.604 --> 35:06.939
- Come on man.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.862
I didn't sit around there
to wait and find out.

35:12.236 --> 35:13.362
Come on, please.

35:14.655 --> 35:15.656
Cover me in prayer.

35:22.663 --> 35:23.664
Please.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.632
- Our Father God.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.262
You said in Your word,
Father God that we can come

35:38.345 --> 35:40.973
boldly before the throne
with reverential fear.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.393
I come before that
throne, Father God to pray

35:45.477 --> 35:48.939
for my brother
Samuel, Father God.

35:50.399 --> 35:54.403
In many ways, Father, he
may have lost his way,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.238
but we know that Father Go...

35:57.698 --> 35:58.866
- Thanks, man, thanks.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.784
Thanks, thanks.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.294
Mama asked about you.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.630
- That's not my mother.

36:18.552 --> 36:22.723
And I'm surprised her
better half, that reverend,

36:22.806 --> 36:25.601
I'm surprised he never
ran you off like he,

36:25.684 --> 36:27.185
like he ran me off.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.231
- She only
practically raised us.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.526
The only thing we agree on...

36:34.610 --> 36:35.527
- Yeah, well...

36:35.611 --> 36:36.611
- Is him.

36:38.113 --> 36:42.409
- Somebody's discipline is
also someone else's abuse.

36:45.412 --> 36:48.081
- You know, when
I saw him today,

36:50.751 --> 36:52.502
it took everything in my spirit

36:53.712 --> 36:55.380
not to put my hands on him.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.176
- That's too bad you didn't.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.639
Probably made him
a better reverend.

37:08.769 --> 37:09.937
Here, man, here.

37:25.535 --> 37:26.535
I gotta go.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.958
Now, I put a couple extra
hundred in there, so you know,

37:31.041 --> 37:32.584
you make sure you
treat yourself, man.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.169
Get yourself a nice meal

37:35.337 --> 37:36.588
and if nothing else, please,

37:38.131 --> 37:39.549
get yourself a nice suit.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.228
- I can't keep doing this.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.871
- Look man, I gotta
go, man, I gotta go.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.858
Alright, I gotta go.

37:59.528 --> 38:03.573
- One day, one day
something'll catch up with you.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.728
- What do you,

38:33.687 --> 38:35.105
what do you want?

38:35.188 --> 38:37.190
Your father's in the ICU.

38:37.274 --> 38:38.775
He had a heart
attack last night.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.529
Sandra, you hear me?

38:42.612 --> 38:43.655
- Where are you?

38:43.739 --> 38:45.240
- I'm at Baylor.

38:46.408 --> 38:49.161
- Okay, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.338
How is he?

39:00.422 --> 39:02.966
- He just came out of surgery.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.801
They did a triple bypass on him.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.389
- Doctors told him about
his drinking and smoking.

39:09.473 --> 39:12.476
- He wasn't drinking and
he hasn't a cigarette

39:12.559 --> 39:13.852
in months now.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.645
You could act a
little more concerned.

39:15.729 --> 39:16.855
- I'm concerned about you.

39:17.647 --> 39:18.857
- That is still your father.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.442
- That is not my father.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.087
If they would have
known what kind of man

39:23.111 --> 39:25.151
they had on that table,
they would have let him die.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.616
- Sandra, dear.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.699
Sandra, I'm so sorry.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.327
Baby, I'm so sorry.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.537
- Let go of my arm.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.165
Let you stand by your
man like you always do.

39:37.501 --> 39:38.293
- Mrs. Thomas?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.169
- Yes.

39:39.252 --> 39:41.213
- The surgery was a success.

39:41.296 --> 39:42.798
He's really strong.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.883
- We've done everything
we can, but what he needs

39:44.966 --> 39:46.885
more than anything
right now is prayer.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.598
- Thank you, doctor.

39:51.681 --> 39:52.681
- Of course.

40:27.551 --> 40:31.555
- There is something
about a man in a nice suit.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.682
- Shh, I'll tell you what.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.018
It certainly feels better
than those polyester blends.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.854
- This is your uniform, Pastor.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.649
Look, a nice suit
exudes confidence.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.881
- Yeah, but I don't know
if I should spend this much

40:48.905 --> 40:50.866
on just one suit.

40:50.949 --> 40:54.744
- No, you should,
and deservingly so.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.788
Yeah?

40:59.374 --> 41:01.334
- Alright, I'll take it.

41:01.418 --> 41:02.645
- Alright, just hand it
to me when you're done

41:02.669 --> 41:03.545
and I'll get it to the tailor.

41:03.628 --> 41:04.296
- Okay.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.881
- You know what?

41:05.964 --> 41:10.343
I'm gonna throw in this watch
and these cufflinks too.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.762
Yeah, 'cause, yeah.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.308
- This is real nice.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.100
- Yeah.

41:17.184 --> 41:19.227
- Man, look at that.

41:19.311 --> 41:20.311
These cufflinks.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.607
- Um, thank you?

41:24.441 --> 41:25.442
- No, thank you.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.862
- Look, you know Miss
Carey's my mother, right?

41:28.945 --> 41:31.948
She told me that you brought
her groceries the other day

41:32.032 --> 41:35.285
and that you left
$120 there for her.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.081
- I don't, I don't
know what to say.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.500
God bless you.

41:42.584 --> 41:43.793
Thank you.

41:43.877 --> 41:44.896
- I'm gonna ring
these up in the back.

41:44.920 --> 41:45.920
- Alright.

41:59.851 --> 42:00.894
- We're closed.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.605
I said we're closed.

42:05.857 --> 42:06.942
- Hello, son.

42:11.404 --> 42:12.404
- What you want?

42:17.452 --> 42:19.329
- I missed you and
I wanted to see you.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.915
Your brother came by the house.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.417
- I'm not gonna ask
you again, alright?

42:24.501 --> 42:25.877
- Why are you so angry?

42:30.924 --> 42:31.967
- What can I do for you?

42:34.219 --> 42:37.013
- I was going through
some things the other day,

42:37.097 --> 42:39.432
and I came across this,
thought you should have it.

42:41.142 --> 42:42.142
- A bible?

42:43.728 --> 42:45.730
- I laughed so hard
when I used to catch you

42:45.814 --> 42:47.732
and Malcolm playing
at being the reverend.

42:49.609 --> 42:50.920
We were so sure you
were going to be the one

42:50.944 --> 42:53.196
to follow in his footsteps.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.280
You had,

42:55.991 --> 42:57.075
you have

42:59.035 --> 43:01.538
the calling all over you.

43:14.092 --> 43:16.594
Can I have a hug before I go?

43:23.560 --> 43:26.354
I love you and God loves you

43:27.772 --> 43:29.232
and it's time you came home.

43:31.359 --> 43:34.237
- Well that's,
that's funny because

43:36.781 --> 43:39.284
I keep having this dream
where I'm coming home.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.372
- God is working on you.

43:45.540 --> 43:46.583
I can feel it.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.420
And the moment you
stop fighting it,

43:50.503 --> 43:52.130
you'll see the
wonders of His love.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.260
- Well, thanks for
bringing me the bible.

43:58.470 --> 44:00.930
I really, I gotta close up shop.

44:01.014 --> 44:02.057
- Shhh.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.934
- Come on now.

44:20.909 --> 44:21.909
A bible?

44:27.040 --> 44:30.627
- Is that a new
suit and watch, Pastor?

44:32.128 --> 44:34.089
- Yeah, yeah.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.172
Yes it is.

44:35.882 --> 44:38.635
Well, you wear it well.

44:42.347 --> 44:45.016
I already put the new
member forms on your desk.

44:46.101 --> 44:49.104
- Okay, well thank you.

44:52.232 --> 44:53.650
- Yes.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.860
Looking good.

44:56.528 --> 44:57.612
Looking good.

45:04.619 --> 45:07.789
- Hey boss, you
know I was tripping earlier

45:07.872 --> 45:09.916
so I just wanna make sure...

45:09.999 --> 45:13.128
- Listen, listen, forget that.

45:13.211 --> 45:14.921
Did you spill my oil?

45:15.004 --> 45:16.089
- Your oil?

45:16.172 --> 45:18.216
- Yeah, it was almost full.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.342
It was up to here.

45:19.426 --> 45:21.261
Now, it's almost empty.

45:21.344 --> 45:23.221
- Yo, what's going
on with you, man?

45:23.304 --> 45:24.347
Some oil?

45:24.431 --> 45:25.640
What is this, man?

45:25.723 --> 45:26.784
We out here trying
to make money,

45:26.808 --> 45:27.600
you talking about some oil?

45:27.684 --> 45:29.269
- Look, I'm telling you, man.

45:29.352 --> 45:30.728
I know you spilled my oil.

45:30.812 --> 45:31.521
Alright?

45:31.604 --> 45:32.604
It was almost full.

45:33.731 --> 45:34.899
- You slippin'.

45:34.983 --> 45:36.001
Something's going on with you.

45:36.025 --> 45:37.305
You need to get your mind right.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.611
- I got my mind right.

45:38.695 --> 45:40.238
I'm not stupid.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.198
It was all full and
now it's all empty.

45:50.415 --> 45:51.708
- Get it together.

45:51.791 --> 45:53.391
These cats, they eat
your lunch, alright?

45:55.170 --> 45:57.172
- We gonna do this or what?

45:58.631 --> 45:59.631
- The bag.

46:07.307 --> 46:08.667
- What's up with your boy?

46:09.517 --> 46:11.144
- Relax, hey, O.

46:11.227 --> 46:12.562
O, come on.

46:12.645 --> 46:13.521
Hurry up.

46:13.605 --> 46:14.832
- Better get him outta there!

46:14.856 --> 46:16.056
- Hey, hey, you need to relax.

46:17.192 --> 46:17.859
You need to relax.

46:17.942 --> 46:19.194
- You need to relax.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.029
You need to pull him out.

46:21.112 --> 46:23.031
- Chill out, chill out, alright?

46:23.114 --> 46:24.157
We good.

46:25.658 --> 46:26.826
Silk, we good, alright?

46:26.910 --> 46:27.910
Look in the bag.

46:30.914 --> 46:31.914
Easy.

46:32.707 --> 46:34.292
- Thanks for coming to get me.

46:34.375 --> 46:37.712
I called Larry but he
didn't answer his phone, so.

46:40.882 --> 46:42.175
You know what?

46:42.258 --> 46:43.569
If it wasn't for my mama,
I wouldn't have even

46:43.593 --> 46:44.928
gone up there.

46:45.887 --> 46:47.347
What is this?

46:49.057 --> 46:50.058
What is this?

46:50.141 --> 46:51.059
- What was that?

46:51.142 --> 46:52.685
All you gotta do is
bring the bag out.

46:52.769 --> 46:53.829
- You gonna put this on me?

46:53.853 --> 46:54.646
You gonna put this on me?

46:54.729 --> 46:56.147
- Yeah, you got one job.

46:56.231 --> 46:58.066
- Let me tell you,
you know what?

46:58.149 --> 46:59.859
- you don't have to answer that.

46:59.943 --> 47:01.295
- What's that got
to do with anything?

47:01.319 --> 47:02.070
- What's this got?

47:02.153 --> 47:02.820
That's what I'm saying.

47:02.904 --> 47:03.655
- You got one job.

47:03.738 --> 47:04.405
Bring the money out.

47:04.489 --> 47:05.240
- What money?

47:05.323 --> 47:07.617
- What are you doing?

47:13.039 --> 47:15.166
Are you crazy?

47:15.250 --> 47:16.250
- I just...

47:18.878 --> 47:19.712
- Are you out of your mind?

47:19.796 --> 47:22.632
- You had a gun in a cemetery.

47:23.466 --> 47:25.051
You're not good.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.134
- I'm fine.

47:27.178 --> 47:28.721
Now I gotta go back
and get my gun.

47:42.277 --> 47:44.028
- I got you.

48:03.172 --> 48:05.842
- Caught the end
of your service.

48:05.925 --> 48:10.179
Made me wanna come up
there and get saved.

48:10.263 --> 48:12.515
- That so?

48:14.809 --> 48:16.686
How'd you even get in here?

48:22.066 --> 48:25.361
- I just need you to
cover me in prayers.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.700
- What is it, man?

48:30.783 --> 48:31.783
What'd you do?

48:33.202 --> 48:34.287
- Come on.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.582
Just, just cover me in prayers.

48:39.292 --> 48:42.795
I'm ready to go home.

48:42.879 --> 48:44.464
I'm ready to go home.

48:44.547 --> 48:45.840
- You are home.

48:45.923 --> 48:48.301
Stay with me, stay
with me, alright?

48:48.384 --> 48:49.384
Stay with me.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.738
- It's okay, I'm
ready to go home.

48:50.762 --> 48:51.822
- Pastor, what's going on?

48:51.846 --> 48:54.390
- Just call an ambulance now.

48:54.474 --> 48:56.476
- Ready to go home.

48:56.559 --> 48:57.870
- You're not
finished, you're not finished.

48:57.894 --> 48:59.312
Call an ambulance.

48:59.395 --> 49:02.398
- Yes, hi, we need an ambulance.

49:02.482 --> 49:03.816
- You're not finished.

49:03.900 --> 49:06.277
- At 1901 Crenshaw
Drive, back of the church.

49:09.155 --> 49:10.281
- Are they on the way?

49:10.365 --> 49:15.370
- Listen, listen just hurry up.

49:20.041 --> 49:23.169
Heavenly Father, Heavenly
Father we stand before You

49:23.252 --> 49:26.339
right now standing in
deep prayer of our Father.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.233
We don't know what brought
him in this condition,

49:28.257 --> 49:29.842
but we know that it's
not by coincidence

49:29.926 --> 49:31.427
that he is here at
Your house today.

49:31.511 --> 49:34.013
Heavenly Father, please, send
down Your angels of mercy

49:34.097 --> 49:36.516
upon us, send down Your
angels of mercy, please Lord.

49:36.599 --> 49:39.310
Cover him and watch him,
keep him dear Lord, shh...

49:40.436 --> 49:41.705
- Why y'all praying
for this boy?

49:41.729 --> 49:44.440
He ain't doing nothing
to sell no drugs.

49:44.524 --> 49:46.693
The bible says you
live by the sword

49:46.776 --> 49:50.321
so shall be written you reap
what you sow, by the sword.

49:50.405 --> 49:52.490
- Shh, Sister Jenkins, please.

49:54.158 --> 49:56.911
- You ain't got
to shush me twice.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.454
I'm calling the police.

49:59.414 --> 50:00.289
Heathen in here
selling drugs like

50:00.373 --> 50:02.250
it's a dad-gum grocery store.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.299
- So, what's the latest?

50:10.383 --> 50:13.136
- The doctors say he's not
responding to treatment.

50:13.219 --> 50:15.680
His blood pressure
just keeps dropping.

50:16.806 --> 50:17.890
- Have you gotten any rest?

50:17.974 --> 50:19.016
Have you eaten anything?

50:19.100 --> 50:20.351
- No, baby.

50:20.435 --> 50:24.313
- Ma, you still need to
take care of yourself.

50:24.397 --> 50:25.481
- I can't.

50:25.565 --> 50:28.359
I wanna be here
when he wakes up.

50:28.443 --> 50:31.696
- I promise you, if he
wakes up, I'll come get you.

50:31.779 --> 50:35.366
- Listen, I am
staying right here.

50:35.450 --> 50:38.202
- Mama, I don't want
to fight with you.

50:40.580 --> 50:41.580
Okay?

50:42.415 --> 50:45.668
If you get sick, you
won't be here for him.

50:49.005 --> 50:51.007
- You promise you'll
come and get me?

50:51.924 --> 50:52.924
- I promise.

50:59.182 --> 51:02.769
- Baby, you know why I
stay with your daddy?

51:04.437 --> 51:08.107
Because I wanna prove
to him that I love him

51:08.191 --> 51:09.358
more than he loves me.

51:09.442 --> 51:10.568
- But he hits you...

51:10.651 --> 51:13.279
- He loves me, that is all.

51:13.362 --> 51:17.158
I know without a shadow of
a doubt that he loves me.

51:18.451 --> 51:22.413
Whatever you think he is
doing to me, he saved me.

51:23.831 --> 51:27.585
Trust me, I am telling
you that he saved me.

51:30.046 --> 51:32.882
His is the only love
that I have ever known.

51:35.968 --> 51:37.762
I owe him everything.

51:49.857 --> 51:54.237
- Just do us all
a favor and die.

52:02.411 --> 52:03.496
- Here you go, Detective.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.498
Samuel Wiggins, but
they call him Silk.

52:05.581 --> 52:06.624
- Okay, thank you.

52:07.792 --> 52:09.502
- Pastor, I have your shirt.

52:10.545 --> 52:13.673
- So you have no idea
of how he got in here

52:13.756 --> 52:14.756
or who shot him?

52:16.008 --> 52:18.219
- No, officer, it's
like I told you...

52:18.302 --> 52:19.554
- Detective.

52:19.637 --> 52:22.139
- Excuse me, Detective,
it's like I told you

52:22.223 --> 52:24.559
when I came into
the office he was,

52:24.642 --> 52:26.060
he was there in that chair.

52:28.145 --> 52:30.690
- All due respect,
Pastor Stevens,

52:32.191 --> 52:34.694
but I'm just trying
to understand how

52:34.777 --> 52:36.487
one of the biggest

52:36.571 --> 52:38.406
drug dealers in the
city could get into

52:38.489 --> 52:40.658
your office without
anybody seeing him?

52:42.577 --> 52:46.080
Why would he come here instead
of going someplace else?

52:46.163 --> 52:49.083
- Well, maybe it's because
me and Silk grew up together.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.210
Practically from birth.

52:51.294 --> 52:53.004
That's no secret.

52:54.589 --> 52:56.382
- So, what's your
relationship now?

52:58.092 --> 52:59.218
- Pastor, we gotta go.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.179
- There's no, no relationship.

53:02.263 --> 53:04.724
I see him every once in a while.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.145
- And what do you talk about?

53:09.228 --> 53:10.605
- Pastor, we gotta go.

53:11.606 --> 53:12.607
I got your shirt, okay?

53:12.690 --> 53:15.568
- Same old song and
dance we've always done.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.612
I talk to him about
turning his life around

53:17.695 --> 53:20.573
and he always tells me he's
working for the other guy.

53:20.656 --> 53:23.659
- Has he ever talked to you
specifically about his business?

53:24.535 --> 53:26.078
- Why would he?

53:26.162 --> 53:29.165
- Naw, I mean, you said the
both of you go way back,

53:29.248 --> 53:30.833
so I figured well
maybe, you know,

53:30.917 --> 53:32.197
he'd wanna confide in his homie.

53:34.670 --> 53:36.547
You know, the good Reverend.

53:39.258 --> 53:42.219
- Listen, Detective.

53:42.303 --> 53:46.432
Now I know no one may
cry a river over Samuel,

53:46.515 --> 53:48.476
but what I see is someone
who's still trying

53:48.559 --> 53:51.520
to turn their life
around, that's what I see.

53:51.604 --> 53:53.689
And I understand you
have a job to do,

53:55.066 --> 53:57.401
but my focus here
is on a human being

53:57.485 --> 53:59.403
that's clinging to life.

53:59.487 --> 54:02.156
Alright, that's
what my focus is.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.075
So, unless we have
anything else here,

54:05.701 --> 54:08.162
can I get cleaned up
and get outta here?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.525
- Naw, I think we're about done.

54:10.331 --> 54:14.752
Yeah, I'm gonna ask
ya some more questions

54:14.835 --> 54:17.254
in a few days and
don't make any plans

54:17.338 --> 54:22.301
to take a trip anywhere until
we get this cleared up, okay?

54:24.470 --> 54:27.640
- Well, Detective, you'll
know where to find me.

54:28.557 --> 54:30.977
- Thank you, thank you, come on.

54:39.568 --> 54:43.823
- Paging Dr.
Bender, paging Dr. Bender.

54:56.502 --> 54:57.795
Are you the doctor?

54:57.878 --> 54:59.839
- Excuse me, are you
Mr. Wiggins' family?

54:59.922 --> 55:02.967
- Yes, he's my foster
brother and I'm his pastor.

55:03.050 --> 55:04.343
- Hi, I'm Dr. Quan.

55:05.928 --> 55:08.514
Well, it's a good thing
we got to him when we did.

55:08.597 --> 55:09.890
He did lose a lot of blood.

55:09.974 --> 55:12.601
We were able to stop
any further bleeding.

55:12.685 --> 55:14.228
- Okay, okay.

55:14.311 --> 55:15.580
- One of the bullets
perforated his stomach

55:15.604 --> 55:18.357
and the other lodged
between C4 and C5

55:18.441 --> 55:19.817
vertebrae of his spine.

55:21.027 --> 55:22.653
It's too early to take it out.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.489
- Can I go see him?

55:25.573 --> 55:26.573
- Just a little bit.

55:44.216 --> 55:46.635
- I'm live outside
Bethany United Church.

55:46.719 --> 55:50.222
A man identified as 39
year old Samuel Wiggins

55:50.306 --> 55:53.726
walked inside the church
sometime around 11 this morning

55:53.809 --> 55:57.104
bleeding from what we're
told was a gunshot wound.

55:57.188 --> 55:58.606
- Hey honey, come here.

55:58.689 --> 56:00.459
- He was found
in Pastor Malcolm Stevens'

56:00.483 --> 56:01.942
office unconscious on the floor.

56:02.026 --> 56:02.902
- Baby, come here,
this is what I

56:02.985 --> 56:04.361
was talking about this morning.

56:04.445 --> 56:06.089
- Rushed to Baylor
University Medical Hospital,

56:06.113 --> 56:07.823
last listed in
critical condition.

56:07.907 --> 56:10.493
- Honey come on,
you're gonna miss it.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.387
- When I asked the mega-pastor

56:12.411 --> 56:13.638
for a comment, he
declined to speak with us.

56:13.662 --> 56:14.455
- Baby.

56:14.538 --> 56:15.372
- Shh.

56:15.456 --> 56:17.208
Stop yellin', I hear you.

56:17.291 --> 56:18.793
- Somebody got
shot at the church.

56:18.876 --> 56:22.088
- Now let's send you to
Angela over at the hospital.

56:22.171 --> 56:23.255
- What?

56:23.339 --> 56:24.775
- Found him in Pastor
Stevens' office.

56:24.799 --> 56:26.008
- My...

56:26.092 --> 56:27.635
- Wait, here it
comes right here.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.804
- Where Samuel Wiggins was
rushed after being shot.

56:30.971 --> 56:32.115
- Do you know this guy here?

56:32.139 --> 56:33.808
- Just, shh.

56:33.891 --> 56:35.702
- His foster father also tell...

56:35.726 --> 56:36.726
- My gosh.

56:44.985 --> 56:45.903
- Are you okay?

56:45.986 --> 56:47.780
- Yeah, no, yeah I'm okay.

56:47.863 --> 56:48.948
Really, I am.

56:50.282 --> 56:51.659
- How is he?

56:51.742 --> 56:53.661
- Doctors say he's
out of the woods.

56:53.744 --> 56:54.744
- Good.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.413
- Yeah.

57:01.752 --> 57:02.795

59:35.739 --> 59:38.242

59:45.457 --> 59:48.127
- I think it's
time we had a little talk.

59:51.588 --> 59:55.384
- Okay, what can I do for you?

59:55.467 --> 59:59.722
- Well, you have been
spending a lot of time

59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.224
down at that hospital
with that drug dealer.

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:05.978
People might start to
get the wrong idea.

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:12.651
- And what idea might that be?

01:00:14.987 --> 01:00:17.072
- I know you took
the money from Silk.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.536
But don't you worry.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.038
Your secret's safe with me.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:29.043
I'm sure we can work out
some type of arrangement.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:01.992
- Blessed is the man
that endures temptation

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:05.788
for when he is tried,

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.752
this, this,

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:14.213
this ain't gonna happen.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:16.548
You just need to leave.

01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:17.632
Alright?

01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:21.154
- So, you don't
think I'm serious

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:24.306
about telling everyone
about you and Silk.

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:28.477
The new suits, the watches.

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:40.280
- No, Nikki.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.573
I know you're serious.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:47.162
But you know what?

01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:49.248
You do whatever you gotta do.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.834
Me?

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.877
I gotta get ready for service.

01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:56.004
So, if you'll excuse me,
you can close the door

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:57.089
on your way out.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:03.512
- Look, don't test
my patience negro.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:07.641
- You know what?

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:11.270
Why don't we just make
today your last day?

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:18.694
- I promise, you
will regret this.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:26.785
- You close that
door on your way out.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:27.869
- Got it.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.052
- I told you
that this wasn't over.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.178
- Is this true?

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:30.932
- Yes.

01:03:32.226 --> 01:03:33.310
It's true.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:34.433
There was no reason for...

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:38.148
Don't you say another word.

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:44.196
You see, because the bible
says uttereth not a word

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.406
from a man who is full of sin.

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:51.077
Now,

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:53.829
do your job.

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:03.382
- Pastor, I'm sorry to say this,

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.134
but you must leave the premises.

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:07.928
You must leave the premises now.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:10.513
- What's going on?

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:12.766
What's going on in here?

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:21.355
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.943
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.247
Wait, wait, wait, no
this is not right.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.082
- It's okay Levar.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.165
It's okay.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.379
- You had the keys
to the promised land.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.760
- Malcolm, Malcolm, wait.

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:51.137
Really?

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:00.813
Malcolm.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:19.749
- Hey.

01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:37.517
I am sorry, but I
didn't do anything.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:38.601
- I know.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:41.438
I know.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.441
I know, I, um,

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.903
I was just under so much stress.

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:56.787
Do you know why I married you?

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:59.998
- Because I'm your soulmate.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.251
- That's one of the reasons.

01:06:06.088 --> 01:06:07.088
The other reason

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:13.345
is how my father was

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.306
horrifying.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:23.188
He terrorized my family
when I was young and...

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:30.487
Now it's sad to say but
I didn't want anyone

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.699
who, the same height, build,

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:38.453
skin complexion

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.416
that remotely resembled him.

01:06:46.128 --> 01:06:47.754
I wanted to be able
to give my heart

01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:49.423
without feeling like I...

01:06:54.386 --> 01:06:55.429
Tired.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.308
I'm tired, I'm
tired of fighting.

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:02.436
I'm tired of being mad, I'm...

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.192
Just tired.

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:14.238
I'm just tired.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.545
So you can take me home?

01:07:31.757 --> 01:07:32.757
- Come on.

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:08.919
- Come on man, come on in.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.002
The door open.

- I'm alright, I guess.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:30.649
- Alright, alright,
okay, so look here.

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:35.779
Church is split,
but I think that...

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:36.862
- Stop.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:40.617
Stop Levar.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.868
- What's up?

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:44.537
- No.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:45.538
- What up?

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:49.000
- I deserve everything I get.

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:50.210
I deserve it.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.337
- So what's up?

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.337
You giving up now?

01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:01.263
- I'm not giving
up, but this time,

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:04.307
I messed up, man.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:08.353
I messed up.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:14.483
Again.

01:09:17.696 --> 01:09:18.696
- Again?

01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.953
- Remember that time
back in high school,

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.580
Silk got kicked off
the basketball team

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.456
for having that pound of weed?

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.166
- Yeah, 'cause we
was all surprised.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.419
We was real confused
when you got sent

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:35.171
to juvie and Silk
got suspension.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.051
- Well, what people
didn't know was that I lied

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:42.304
and told the principal
it was my marijuana.

01:09:46.892 --> 01:09:49.102
- Man, that makes sense.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.645
Okay, okay.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.107
So that's why he's
been coming around?

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.211
Being around the church 'cause
he feels like he owes you.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:58.695
That's why he gave
you the money.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:05.368
- It's always something,
and this time,

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:08.997
it was, he just wanted
to pay his tithes

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.332
and be covered in prayer.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.709
But every time,

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:18.173
every time I help him, I lose.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:19.609
But I shoulda never
took that money.

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:20.342
I did that.

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:21.425
I took the money.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:24.930
- Yeah, yeah, you did.

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.139
You did that, so what?

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:33.063
Look man, we're human, right?

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:35.148
What does it say in the word?

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.650
The word says that

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.861
what man intended for evil

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:41.321
God can use for good.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:42.322
That's exactly what happened.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:43.823
Your intentions were righteous.

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:47.386
- Maybe you
should be the pastor.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.537

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:57.921

You're not finished with me.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.713

never ending work.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.776

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.993
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.619
Quiet, quiet.

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:14.831
You've all had your say
and now it's time to vote.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:19.878
Now, in front of you, you
have a piece of paper.

01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:22.797
And on that piece of
paper you have a pen.

01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:24.841
What you will do,
you'll cast your vote

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:25.759
on that piece of paper.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.595
You will either write yes or no.

01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:32.766
And that, my good
people, will determine

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.393
the fate of this

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.146
pastor.

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.147
- Okay, this is ridiculous.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.065
Excuse me, no excuse me.

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:41.357
Excuse me, excuse me.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:42.609
This is ridiculous.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:43.753
What we're not gonna
do is we're not gonna

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:45.278
sit up here and
condemn this man.

01:12:45.361 --> 01:12:46.589
That's what we're not gonna do.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:49.240
Who is without sin
cast the first stone.

01:12:49.324 --> 01:12:50.158
Let me say that.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:51.659
Let me say that.

01:12:51.743 --> 01:12:54.579
We know that Brother
Malcolm has been our leader

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:56.498
and pastor for the
past four years...

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:57.624
- Under false pretenses.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:58.787
- He has made the congre...

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.502
He has grown this congregation.

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:02.796
Under his ministry we have
built a charter school

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:03.713
for the children's ministry...

01:13:03.797 --> 01:13:05.048
- With funny money.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:05.840
- Okay?

01:13:05.924 --> 01:13:06.924
- Come on.

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.343
- Okay, yeah, so what?

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.404
Yes, the money was dirty,
okay, what would Jesus do?

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.763
He would do the same thing.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:12.680
He would, he would...

01:13:12.764 --> 01:13:14.641
- The bible says
blessed not ye the man

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.602
who make monies of
the ways of perverse.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:18.561
- Okay, hold on.

01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:20.897
Sister Mary, Sister Mary.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.816
When your mama needed
that operation,

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.735
when she was going
through chemotherapy,

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.781
did you say, "No, Pastor.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:32.200
"We don't want this
money to help Mama.

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:33.868
"We don't want that."

01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:36.913
When your children couldn't eat?

01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:39.749
You needed money for food

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.835
and you needed school supplies?

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:44.754
When we did that fund
raiser, we had all that...

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:47.048
- What is your point?

01:13:47.132 --> 01:13:48.299
- What are we saying?

01:13:48.383 --> 01:13:50.063
- What are you doing here?

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:54.472
- I am still pastor
of this church,

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:55.765
until the vote happens.

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:57.934
- You are not
supposed to be here.

01:13:58.017 --> 01:13:59.310
- Mrs. Jenkins.

01:13:59.394 --> 01:14:01.234
- I came here
to fight for my church.

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:04.648
- What?

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:08.652
- Please.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:11.322
- Please what?

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:12.406
- Shut up.

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:16.202
- Well, I never.

01:14:35.847 --> 01:14:38.808
- I know I've stood
up here many Sundays

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:41.728
as your pastor,
but the truth is,

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:47.358
I'm just a man and
I face temptation

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:49.235
like any other man.

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:51.404
That's what I face.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:56.618
I'll be the first to
admit I'm not perfect

01:14:57.744 --> 01:15:02.498
and I allowed my own desires

01:15:02.582 --> 01:15:05.543
to fuel and run me at times

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.881
and I knew at some point
that I'd have to reconcile

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:12.634
those decisions, all
of those decisions,

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:16.304
and that God would
hold me accountable.

01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:23.186
So, knowing that He will
hold me accountable,

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:26.940
I just, I thought to myself,

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.150
as long as I continue
to do, though, Father,

01:15:29.234 --> 01:15:32.570
what I thought was what
He wanted me to do,

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.908
I could somehow
put off this day.

01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:42.580
I don't even know to say this.

01:15:44.832 --> 01:15:48.878
The truth is, plain
and simple, I messed up

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:50.421
and then I tried to cover it up.

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:57.679
But I realize now that nothing,

01:15:57.762 --> 01:16:00.056
nothing's worth
separating me from God.

01:16:00.932 --> 01:16:01.933
Nothing.

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:04.894
And I knew that
I'd have to own up

01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:07.855
to the consequences
of my decisions.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:17.073
I know, I know some of
you might leave the church

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:21.035
because of this,
I understand that.

01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:24.831
But what I ask to each
and every one of you is,

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.667
don't let your faith be damaged

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.712
by the actions of one man.

01:16:30.795 --> 01:16:32.255
- Okay, you've had your say.

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:33.881
Thank you very much.

01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:35.925
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
it is your time to vote

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:39.178
and remember, you vote

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:41.931
no

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:44.309
Or yes.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.395
Our church deserves better.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:54.027
- However you vote,
however that is,

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:57.280
don't harden your hearts.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:01.951
I pray for your forgiveness.

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:08.833
And I pray that you all
allow me the opportunity

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:15.006
to show you all the
pastor that I can be.

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:20.803
Thank you for your time.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:35.734
- Well,

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.489
alright.

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:40.573
So, it's time.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:47.246
All those in favor
of the pastor, stand.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.790
Raise your hand and say yea.

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:56.421
Yea.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:00.802
- All the no's.

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:16.608
- Pastor.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.780
Come back, come here.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.236
- A heart that forgives.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:04.115
Words cannot describe how much

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:07.368
you all have blessed
me this morning.

01:19:07.452 --> 01:19:09.954
But His forgiveness
is not just for me.

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:14.917
No, no, it's for anyone,
anyone who will call on Him.

01:19:16.169 --> 01:19:18.838
Now, who will call
on Him this morning?

01:19:20.298 --> 01:19:22.425
Who will finally
get that forgiveness

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.968
you've been longing for?

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:29.932
Who will finally, finally be
able to get rid of that pain

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:35.021
that you've been asking
and needing forgiveness for

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.230
in your heart?

01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:39.192
Who will it be?
