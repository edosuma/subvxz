Not entirely rational behavior,
is it?

03:31.451 --> 03:33.226
He went after his brother.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.178
I like to think I would do
the same thing.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.011
Quite.

03:37.403 --> 03:39.437
Did he say anything before he
went through?

03:40.707 --> 03:41.799
Like what?

03:42.218 --> 03:43.611
I don't know.

03:43.731 --> 03:45.795

03:47.051 --> 03:48.771
He was pretty focused on
Patrick.

03:49.666 --> 03:51.495
Well, I suppose that's
understandable.

09:54.983 --> 09:57.249
it'll make sense of the
anomalies.

09:59.256 --> 10:00.812
It'll make use of them.

10:02.942 --> 10:04.280
To do what?

10:04.400 --> 10:07.332
Solve the greatest problem
facing mankind today.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.052

sock missing after you've done the washing?

10:15.922 --> 10:17.628
The anomalies are a resource.

10:18.229 --> 10:22.161

energy Connor.

10:27.575 --> 10:31.343
Energy that's safe, that's

10:59.423 --> 11:01.511
He's just left the
Arc with Philip.

11:01.631 --> 11:02.986
Can't raise him on coms.

11:04.104 --> 11:06.861
Can't wait for him, we need to get
down there and see what we're dealing with.

11:12.657 --> 11:14.568
Doesn't look manmade.

11:16.135 --> 11:17.708
Kind of a big mole then.

11:25.854 --> 11:27.014
Wait!

11:27.697 --> 11:29.335
Burrowing creatures work
on vibrations.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.629
Every step you take let's
you know it's here.

12:23.648 --> 12:24.699
Come on.

12:31.013 --> 12:32.228
So what now?

12:34.945 --> 12:36.651
We need guns.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.655
Lethal weapons.

12:40.443 --> 12:41.453
What?

12:41.573 --> 12:42.313
Really?

12:42.433 --> 12:44.279
The MD's are useless. The bullets are
just bouncing right off.

12:44.399 --> 12:46.095
But... it could have a...

12:46.215 --> 12:47.064
No Abby.

12:47.871 --> 12:50.246
We're not going to stun this one
and bring it back to the menagerie.

12:51.850 --> 12:52.997
We're gonna have to kill it.

12:53.725 --> 12:55.391
Finally common sense.

12:55.718 --> 12:56.974
Leave it with me.

13:13.812 --> 13:15.778
Oh... ho ho.

13:16.098 --> 13:17.846
This is... Wow.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.491
You must be Connor Temple.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.341
Yes. Allow me to introduce
April Leonard.

13:25.461 --> 13:27.457
I've heard so much about you.

13:27.577 --> 13:28.576

13:28.696 --> 13:30.400
Philip's always talking

13:30.520 --> 13:32.406
He says your a genius.

13:32.526 --> 13:34.918
I'm sure...

13:35.038 --> 13:36.857
I'm sure he's exaggerating.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.727
To a point.

13:38.847 --> 13:40.981
How would you feel about April
assisting you in your lab?

13:41.582 --> 13:43.889
I want you to have all the help you
need on New Dawn.

13:45.309 --> 13:47.056
It would be an honor.

13:47.901 --> 13:50.686
Really? I mean...
Yes.

13:51.184 --> 13:54.924
That would be... Never

Jess!

14:07.955 --> 14:11.412
- Fill me in.
- Matt's OK but he's requested new weapons.

14:11.532 --> 14:14.037
Not that. My vetting with the cabinet
office. What time's the meeting?

14:14.157 --> 14:17.354
15 minutes. Hold on. Your tie's
not straight.

14:19.912 --> 14:20.690
Good?

14:20.810 --> 14:21.911
Ok. Good luck.

14:22.031 --> 14:22.839
Thank you.

14:26.940 --> 14:29.807
Matt, I'm putting up maps of all the
underground systems in the area.

14:29.927 --> 14:31.753
Sewers, service pipes, everything,

14:31.873 --> 14:33.992
and I'm working on a ground
penetrating radar map.

14:34.112 --> 14:35.275
Ok, thanks Jess.

14:35.395 --> 14:37.132
Any sign of Connor, by the way?

14:37.252 --> 14:39.289
Hey! Yo!

14:41.444 --> 14:43.137
Nice of you to join us.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.309
Where have you been?
I was worried.

14:44.429 --> 14:47.107
I was just... I was just...
with Philip.

14:47.227 --> 14:48.705
Doing what exactly?

14:48.825 --> 14:51.490
Yeah, uh, that's... that's the
thing, it's kind of classified.

14:51.610 --> 14:55.352
But I'm going to need new coms and a new
black box when we get back to the Arc,

14:55.844 --> 14:57.933
Purely professional com?

14:58.053 --> 14:59.614
Talk about this later.

14:59.734 --> 15:02.713
Right now, Jess sent through some
maps. I'm going to need your help.

15:02.833 --> 15:03.291
Ok.

15:08.637 --> 15:09.401
Lester.

15:09.521 --> 15:11.531
Lester, it's Becker. I'm afraid
the EMD's won't cut it.

15:11.651 --> 15:14.139
We're going to need conventional
firepower and that means guns.

15:14.259 --> 15:14.903
How many guns?

15:15.023 --> 15:16.282
As many as you can spare.

15:16.402 --> 15:18.621
Oh, yeah, fine. Perhaps you'd
like  a tank as well.

15:18.741 --> 15:19.372
What tank.

15:19.492 --> 15:21.147
No. No. I was obviously joking.

15:21.267 --> 15:23.331
- But really, a tank.
- You can't have a tank.

15:23.891 --> 15:27.672
Just dying to know. Who is it,
exactly, that Matt intends to shoot?

15:48.723 --> 15:52.027
Matt, I just sending you something
through now. Not good.

15:52.147 --> 15:53.239
What's this?

15:53.936 --> 15:56.860
Satellite image. Ground
penetrating radar.

15:57.301 --> 15:59.786
This creature's been
here a long time.

15:59.906 --> 16:01.619
Oy yi yi.

16:02.816 --> 16:05.149
Stretches for miles and
intersects every manmade

16:05.269 --> 16:07.271
tunnel and natural cave
system under the city.

16:07.391 --> 16:09.967
Yuck, lucky I just sanctioned
it extermination then.

16:10.697 --> 16:13.591
This would have to happen on the
day I'm being vetted for knighthood.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.985
Yeah, some creatures just have
no sense of occasion do they?

16:18.603 --> 16:19.451
Right.

16:20.648 --> 16:21.603
This...

16:23.709 --> 16:25.436
looks like his main tunnel.

16:26.229 --> 16:28.517
Right, well it's nest is gonna
be off that somewhere.

16:28.637 --> 16:29.805
Why assume that?

16:30.547 --> 16:33.396
Our best bet is to predict when
it resurfaces and be ready.

16:33.516 --> 16:34.267
If it resurfaces.

16:34.387 --> 16:35.207
It'll resurface.

16:36.191 --> 16:38.267
Now that it knows it's got
a food source above ground.

16:38.387 --> 16:41.826
There's no creature like this
in the fossil records.

16:42.099 --> 16:43.099
So...

16:43.872 --> 16:45.751
must be from the future.

16:47.145 --> 16:48.372
***

17:44.488 --> 17:45.488
Well...

17:45.608 --> 17:47.837
this is our Center of Operations.

17:49.389 --> 17:52.328
I just intercepted this emergency
call to the police.

17:53.495 --> 17:56.919
It just came out of the gound and it was
like this giant insect or something.

18:01.859 --> 18:04.723
They did tell you what we do here?

18:04.843 --> 18:07.677
Not in detail, they just said it
was covered by the offical secrets act.

18:07.797 --> 18:08.874
What do you do exactly?

18:08.994 --> 18:12.056
Well, I don't like to talk about
my own contribution

18:12.380 --> 18:15.410
but it's not every job that one
gets to save lives.

18:15.530 --> 18:17.092
I suspose I'll have
to make it brief.

18:17.212 --> 18:19.047
Matt, we have another potential
creature attack.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.910
I'm gonna send you the
coordinates now.

18:22.042 --> 18:23.860
A house not far from you.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.784
It's killed again.

18:28.345 --> 18:30.496
Right Jess, tell Becker
to meet us there.

18:30.616 --> 18:32.663
Two victims in an hour. This
things hungry.

18:32.783 --> 18:34.946
Or it's stockpiling food.

18:35.066 --> 18:36.886
Or there's more than one
creature.

18:37.006 --> 18:38.295
Right, then.

18:38.961 --> 18:41.674
Either way, we gotta know.

18:48.999 --> 18:50.924
Get those people out of here.

18:51.044 --> 18:53.106
Connor, have you laid a map over
those radar results yet?

18:53.226 --> 18:53.742
Yep.

18:54.243 --> 18:55.576
Just today.

19:02.394 --> 19:03.955
Can we make a 3D model of this?

19:04.075 --> 19:05.548
We're looking for a nest
in the tunnels.

19:05.668 --> 19:07.305
It will be part of an
already exiting structure.

19:07.866 --> 19:11.108
Ok, that's pretty specific for a  creature
we've never seen before, but I'm on it.

19:11.228 --> 19:12.911
You seem to know  lot
about this thing.

19:32.026 --> 19:35.132
Guys, stay back from
the edge of the hole.

19:38.870 --> 19:41.112
Need to find the next
large patch of grass.

19:41.612 --> 19:43.112
But the first attack
was in the road.

19:43.232 --> 19:45.931
It can't burrow through concrete,
the workmen made that hole themselves.

19:46.472 --> 19:48.972
It's hunting for food. It won't be
far. We need to lure it out again.

19:49.426 --> 19:50.350
How we gonna do that.

19:51.866 --> 19:52.987
Vibrations.

20:06.207 --> 20:09.176
***, you're right. I am a genius.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.252
Damn it.

20:45.372 --> 20:46.600
Matt be careful.

20:58.814 --> 21:01.662
Ok, Jess, I've located the nest.
I'm sending it over to you right now.

21:03.162 --> 21:03.890
Done.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.875
Where the hell is this thing.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.754
Guys! Hey!

21:09.874 --> 21:11.390
It was under our noses all along.

21:11.510 --> 21:12.239
- No.
- No.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.381
Connor!!!

21:29.501 --> 21:31.850
Abby, no, no, come on.

21:32.282 --> 21:34.434
We'll get him back, I promise,
we'll get him back.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.494
Come on.

21:40.599 --> 21:43.251
Of course one doesn't do
a job like this for the money,

21:43.371 --> 21:46.206
or the glory, but because it's
the right thing to do.

21:46.326 --> 21:47.433
Oh absolutely.

21:47.553 --> 21:52.433
But one can't deny that recognition for
a good job, well done, is always better.

21:52.553 --> 21:55.558
Well I should think working with Philip
Burton must have raised your profile.

21:55.678 --> 21:58.391
I do think it so important
these public, private

21:58.511 --> 22:00.467
partnerships are made
to work effectively.

22:00.587 --> 22:01.937
I couldn't agree with you more.

22:02.752 --> 22:05.842
I mean little people said
it wouldn't work but uh,

22:05.962 --> 22:08.539
Philip and I have an
excellent relationship.

22:08.858 --> 22:10.615
You don't have to ask him.

22:10.735 --> 22:11.979
Oh I will.

22:12.358 --> 22:13.691
Might I ask...

22:13.811 --> 22:17.305
is the knighthood, uh, should
we say a "done deal".

22:17.425 --> 22:19.684
At this stage we need to  make
sure everything's in order.

22:19.804 --> 22:22.365
No skeletons in the closet if
you know what I mean.

22:22.485 --> 22:24.138
You won't find anything like that.

22:24.258 --> 22:25.769
That is good news.

22:25.889 --> 22:27.709
Frankly, I'm impressed.

22:28.390 --> 22:32.875
Breech incident. Small arms fire. 10
civilians requiring treatment for shock.

22:33.587 --> 22:36.709
And we're one man down.
We've lost Connor.

22:38.678 --> 22:39.997
Would you excuse me?

22:51.153 --> 22:52.714
What the hell's going on?

22:52.834 --> 22:53.972
*** Connor.

22:54.092 --> 22:56.118
Yes, I heard you the first time.
What are we doing about it?

22:57.960 --> 22:59.972
At the risk of sounding a
tad self involved

23:00.092 --> 23:01.693
this better not screw
up my knighthood.

23:02.421 --> 23:04.330
We can find him, don't worry.

23:04.990 --> 23:07.157
If you were an insect would
you want to eat Connor?

23:09.475 --> 23:12.384
Matt, you see the area Connor
indicated as the most likely nest?

23:16.369 --> 23:18.203
I can, yeah.
I think he's right.

23:18.323 --> 23:21.188
His black box signal is heading
back towards the road works.

23:22.294 --> 23:24.581
I'll set up and exclusion zone.

23:25.317 --> 23:27.227
He's taking him back to the nest.

23:27.347 --> 23:27.908
Yeah.

23:40.142 --> 23:41.121
Probably went...

23:41.839 --> 23:44.253
Abby can dial into it carefully here.

23:44.373 --> 23:45.795
Don't tell me to calm down. This is
Connor we're talking about.

23:45.915 --> 23:46.843
He could be dead already.

23:46.963 --> 23:48.307
If he is there's nothing
we can do,

23:48.427 --> 23:50.673
if he isn't, charging in here without
a plan is not going to help him.

23:50.793 --> 23:52.574
It's one creature.

23:52.694 --> 23:53.942
And it's already injured.

23:54.650 --> 23:57.132
The bullets pierced the
exoskeleton, I saw it.

23:57.252 --> 23:59.711
You said yourself, we're not even
sure if it is one creature.

24:00.128 --> 24:03.096
Jess tracked Connors' black box to
the last chamber under this building.

24:03.552 --> 24:06.442
Burrowing insects hibernate in
clusters when the weather heats up...

24:07.218 --> 24:08.304
a scout heads out to

24:08.424 --> 24:08.915
collect food.

24:09.035 --> 24:09.923
- Yeah.
- Great.

24:10.043 --> 24:12.110
Jess, we don't do anything
until we're sure what's down there.

24:13.137 --> 24:14.582
We could put a camera in.

24:15.096 --> 24:16.580
What about infrared?

24:18.997 --> 24:19.714
Connor?

24:20.461 --> 24:21.596
Connor!

24:22.769 --> 24:23.438
Connor?

24:24.378 --> 24:25.280
Connor can you hear us?

24:33.081 --> 24:34.002
I can hear you.

24:36.974 --> 24:37.740
Connor...

24:38.845 --> 24:40.523
are you ok, are you hurt?

24:43.051 --> 24:44.690
Few bumps and bruises but...

24:45.569 --> 24:47.599
I suppose that's to be
expected in this line of work.

24:50.060 --> 24:50.777
Hey...

24:51.165 --> 24:52.823
that's pretty nifty shooting guys.

24:53.502 --> 24:54.569
Creature's dead.

24:55.257 --> 24:56.469
Connor where are you?

24:56.779 --> 24:58.379
Are there any other
survivors with you?

25:05.003 --> 25:05.852
No.

25:10.514 --> 25:11.954
There's no other survivors.

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
Can you see a way up
to the ground?

25:15.393 --> 25:16.423
Can you get out?

25:18.605 --> 25:19.802
There's an escalator.

25:19.922 --> 25:21.614
Ok Connor, head up there.

25:23.901 --> 25:25.432
Any sign of any more creatures?

25:25.552 --> 25:26.053
No.

25:26.523 --> 25:28.174
There's no other creatures.

25:31.871 --> 25:32.871
What is it?

25:35.129 --> 25:36.053
You hurt?

25:37.750 --> 25:40.992
I just don't like being on
escalators that are not moving.

25:41.112 --> 25:42.886
It's just really odd.

25:44.144 --> 25:44.901
Connor...

25:45.021 --> 25:46.795
Got a little scratch on my leg.

25:47.674 --> 25:49.204
Sure I'll be fine.

26:00.772 --> 26:01.878
Ahh!

26:14.597 --> 26:15.597
Daylight.

26:22.544 --> 26:23.998
Oh!

26:24.797 --> 26:27.418
Matt. You know when you asked if
there were any other creatures in here?

26:38.052 --> 26:39.037
Connor.

26:40.431 --> 26:41.370
How many?

26:41.779 --> 26:43.809
More than I'm entirely
happy about.

26:45.019 --> 26:46.398
Can you get a route out of there?

26:47.322 --> 26:48.641
Can you get to the front doors?

26:59.503 --> 27:01.457
I can give it...
I can give it a go.

27:02.381 --> 27:04.775
Whatever you do, do not wake
one of those creatures.

27:04.895 --> 27:06.644
*** Matt, I wasn't planning to.

27:06.901 --> 27:08.856
If you wake one of them,
you wake all of them.

27:08.976 --> 27:12.205
It doesn't matter if they escape we get the
conventional weapons. We'll take them out.

27:12.325 --> 27:13.765
Not a nest of them you won't.

27:13.885 --> 27:15.992
With this many tunnels they'll
be all over the city in no time.

27:16.112 --> 27:18.282
Connor, just get out of there.

27:20.297 --> 27:21.342
Connor?

27:23.964 --> 27:25.009
I've got an idea.

27:25.129 --> 27:26.782
Connor, now just get out of there.

27:26.902 --> 27:29.024
Guys, guys, just listen to me.

27:29.144 --> 27:31.009
Me getting out is the
least of our problems.

27:31.297 --> 27:34.145
If Matt's right then we need to deal
with these creatures before it's too late.

27:34.758 --> 27:36.440
And right now I'm in here.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.698
So I'm our best hope.

27:38.818 --> 27:41.092
Hey Connor forget that. Listen to
Abby and get out of there.

27:41.379 --> 27:43.379
Look, trust me on this.

27:43.499 --> 27:47.001
Get Jess to pull up the records of the
utility services to the building.

27:59.563 --> 28:02.427
I hope you got everything
you need Miss Reese.

28:02.547 --> 28:03.624
Very much so.

28:03.744 --> 28:05.467
Frankly you've been
most impressive.

28:05.587 --> 28:08.058
With something like this, one does
everything one can to help.

28:08.301 --> 28:09.740
He must be a dear colleague.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.786
So. Who must be?

28:12.180 --> 28:14.224
So you said a "dear colleague",
who do you mean.

28:14.344 --> 28:15.528
Philip Burton of course.

28:15.771 --> 28:18.468
I'm sure he'd be flattered to know
the lengths you've gone for him today.

28:22.848 --> 28:24.227
The knighthood's for him?

28:24.347 --> 28:25.242
Of course, who else.

28:26.015 --> 28:28.772
He's going to be...
Sir Philip Burton.

28:29.424 --> 28:30.772
It has a ring to it,
doesn't it.

28:32.925 --> 28:35.076
If there were any doubts
about his suitability.

28:35.196 --> 28:36.940
You've certainly put
my mind at rest.

28:46.659 --> 28:48.129
It's all good.
It's all good.

28:48.621 --> 28:50.485
Yep, good old Philip.

28:50.605 --> 28:54.340
Good old Philip, or should I say,
Sir Philip!

28:54.931 --> 28:56.931
Good. Good. Good.

29:06.421 --> 29:09.557
Please tell me there's a gas supply
that's been heading to this building.

29:10.239 --> 29:11.906
Pipes are capped but the
mains are connected,

29:12.026 --> 29:14.254
so all we have to do
is turn the gas on again.

29:14.374 --> 29:15.133
Do it.

29:15.938 --> 29:17.119
I'm gonna open the valve.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.741
You're a genius Connor.

29:19.407 --> 29:20.922
So everyone keeps saying.

29:21.042 --> 29:24.453
Yet here I am surrounded by
50 giant carnivorous insects.

29:24.907 --> 29:26.150
Well that's on.

29:26.270 --> 29:27.559
We'll have to clear the area.

29:27.679 --> 29:29.225
****

29:29.345 --> 29:31.452
Place to ***, eh, Becker?

29:31.572 --> 29:32.861
I love that.

29:32.981 --> 29:33.543
Boom.

29:35.439 --> 29:37.424
Oh, I know, where is the valve?

29:37.544 --> 29:40.287
According to this it's ***
on the southeast wall, you see it?

29:50.616 --> 29:52.131
Yeah, I think I've got it.

29:52.251 --> 29:53.147
Ok.

29:53.662 --> 29:55.177
Be careful Connor.

29:56.255 --> 29:57.846
What could possibly go wrong?

29:58.452 --> 30:00.619
Oh. Abby...

30:01.589 --> 30:03.892
if this doesn't work out too well,

30:07.508 --> 30:10.130
you'll never so much as
look at another man.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.357
Forget it.

30:12.137 --> 30:14.183
I'll be dating again within days!

30:15.597 --> 30:16.325
Yeah.

30:16.445 --> 30:18.249
I guess with your looks
I wouldn't blame you.

30:19.764 --> 30:20.900
Right.

30:22.022 --> 30:23.143
Here we go.

30:44.101 --> 30:45.374
You ok?

30:45.867 --> 30:46.442
Yes.

30:56.244 --> 30:57.911
Sorry about the knighthood.

30:58.031 --> 31:00.668
Oh. Priorities Jess, priorities.

31:06.350 --> 31:08.380
All right, everybody move back.

31:33.646 --> 31:34.798
Ok.

31:38.740 --> 31:40.255
Ok, I'm nearly there.

31:52.999 --> 31:55.455
That nest is primed.

32:06.785 --> 32:09.633
Ok, I'm coming up out of here.

32:26.732 --> 32:28.323
Connor are you on the move?

32:34.869 --> 32:36.126
Uhhh...

32:37.760 --> 32:39.003
Something's wrong.

32:39.245 --> 32:40.275
Connor hurry up.

32:41.306 --> 32:43.306
Jess shut off the gas.

32:43.426 --> 32:45.003
No Jess don't.

32:45.325 --> 32:47.476
They're awake and I'm trapped.

32:47.779 --> 32:49.689
****

32:49.809 --> 32:51.870
They'll get through the tunnels
and we won't be able to stop them.

32:52.536 --> 32:54.961
Jess shut off the gas...

32:55.400 --> 32:56.340
now.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.022
It's Matt's call.

33:01.325 --> 33:05.659
Shut it off or I'm going to go in there
and get him out myself.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.325
You do that and the attacks we saw today
are going to happen all over the city

33:08.445 --> 33:09.673
only a hundred times worse.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.961
What are you doing?

33:15.197 --> 33:18.425
Remember I told you I'm not gonna
let anything happen to him or you, ok?

33:18.864 --> 33:20.364
You're just going to
have to trust me.

33:20.728 --> 33:23.606
No live rounds here. Won't
take anything to set that gas off.

33:51.865 --> 33:52.971
Abby!

33:54.941 --> 33:56.047
Abby I...

34:00.497 --> 34:01.679
I know.

34:06.967 --> 34:07.634
Uhh.

34:07.754 --> 34:08.920
What do we do?

35:15.220 --> 35:17.462
Connor.
Come on.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.478
Come on Connor, breathe.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.075
Welcome back.

35:36.195 --> 35:36.636
Come on.

35:38.439 --> 35:39.439
Let's get outta here.

35:45.045 --> 35:48.061
Jess can you hear me?
Can you hear me, where are they?

35:48.181 --> 35:49.394
Are they clear yet?

35:51.333 --> 35:52.757
Are they at a safe
enough distance?

35:52.877 --> 35:55.120
No. Wait.
They're still too close.

36:02.411 --> 36:04.441
You've got to do it now.

36:05.396 --> 36:06.654
Not yet.

36:11.690 --> 36:13.144
Do it now. That's an order.

36:13.614 --> 36:14.417
No.

36:16.235 --> 36:17.690
Becker now.

36:17.810 --> 36:18.614
Sorry.

36:45.549 --> 36:46.367
Abby!

36:47.837 --> 36:48.640
Connor.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.080
Matt.

36:52.402 --> 36:53.584
Matt. Connor.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.266
Can you hear me?

36:55.386 --> 36:56.039
Matt.

36:56.630 --> 36:57.296
Connor.

37:02.081 --> 37:02.808
Matt.

37:19.494 --> 37:20.585
Next time...

37:20.979 --> 37:22.070
***

37:22.555 --> 37:24.039
It's nice to see you too, mate.

37:24.964 --> 37:25.949
Creatures?

37:26.388 --> 37:27.252
All dead.

37:27.888 --> 37:28.979
Nice work.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.764
Oh, it's fine. It only hurts
when ***.

37:34.884 --> 37:36.052
That is not fine.

37:36.172 --> 37:38.128
****

37:39.522 --> 37:42.597
****

37:48.450 --> 37:49.101
Matt.

37:52.761 --> 37:53.473
Thanks.

37:57.397 --> 37:58.064
Come on.

38:11.949 --> 38:13.070
So....

38:14.219 --> 38:17.461
It was your idea to blow up
a perfectly good shopping center.

38:19.976 --> 38:20.673
Guilty.

38:21.476 --> 38:24.825
Not to worry. I'll square it
with the *** authorities.

38:26.133 --> 38:27.693
Not that I need any recognition,

38:28.012 --> 38:30.042
or thanks, let alone any
awards,

38:30.693 --> 38:31.966
unlike some people.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.829
Connor there's a
message from April.

38:35.949 --> 38:38.632
She says well done for not getting killed
and she's waiting for you in your lab.

38:38.752 --> 38:39.450
April?

38:39.570 --> 38:40.132
Yeah.

38:40.851 --> 38:42.957
She's a... I was gonna...

38:43.077 --> 38:44.942
She's kind of my new assistant.

38:44.912 --> 38:46.033
Would you believe?

38:47.154 --> 38:50.564
Philip lent her to me. You could
come and meet her if you like.

38:54.587 --> 38:55.299
Come 'n meet her.

38:55.829 --> 38:56.435
Yep.

38:57.677 --> 38:58.587
- Ok.
- Cool.

39:08.842 --> 39:09.478
April.

39:10.039 --> 39:10.887
Hi.

39:12.814 --> 39:14.723
See you made yourself at home.

39:15.451 --> 39:17.526
Tided up and everything. This
was a right mess.

39:17.905 --> 39:19.238
You should see my flat.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.920
This was nothing.

39:23.181 --> 39:25.318
Philip gave me this for you.

39:29.878 --> 39:31.666
It's a very posh case.

39:33.365 --> 39:34.062
Cool.

39:36.698 --> 39:38.729
Got a little posh folder and
everything.

39:40.395 --> 39:42.380
Right, well I take this up to...
and read.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.971
You can't take this with you.

39:44.327 --> 39:46.327
It can't leave my possession.

39:48.312 --> 39:48.873
Really.

39:50.282 --> 39:53.070
<i>You do want to be part of
this project, don't you.</i>

39:53.615 --> 39:55.115
Philip chose you.

39:55.445 --> 39:57.081
That doesn't happen very often.

39:57.201 --> 39:59.248
Yeah, yeah, of course I do,
it's just...

39:59.854 --> 40:02.081
I kind of got dragged
underground by a...

40:02.809 --> 40:03.672
doesn't matter.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.380
I'm a bit of a mess is
what I'm concerned about.

40:07.140 --> 40:07.822
Of course.

40:08.777 --> 40:12.019
Have a shower, check in with
medical, whatever you need to do.

40:12.579 --> 40:15.079
I'll have some food brought in for
us for when you get back.

40:16.685 --> 40:17.276
Cool.

40:19.413 --> 40:20.989
All work and no play.

40:44.083 --> 40:44.856
Matt.

40:46.932 --> 40:48.341
I came to talk to you myself

40:48.461 --> 40:50.613
about how you could have known
so much about those creatures.

40:51.704 --> 40:52.886
And then I realized...

40:54.387 --> 40:56.084
you knew them because you'd
seen them before,

40:59.508 --> 41:00.417
in the future.

41:02.463 --> 41:03.660
Which means one of two things.

41:05.841 --> 41:07.523
Either you've been to their time

41:09.069 --> 41:09.675
or

41:10.420 --> 41:11.829
you came from there

41:12.799 --> 41:13.965
in the first place.

41:17.996 --> 41:19.390
So which one is it?

41:25.808 --> 41:26.959
Come with me.

41:29.838 --> 41:31.838
He'll have the New Dawn files
read by morning.

41:32.505 --> 41:33.960
I'll keep him here until
he's done it.

41:34.535 --> 41:35.141
Good.

41:35.819 --> 41:39.334
Then I want you to find out if Danny
Quinn told anyone else about Helen Carter

41:39.454 --> 41:40.395
before he left.

41:55.565 --> 41:57.322
In the future this
planet's dying.

41:58.671 --> 42:00.307
This is my only
chance to save it.

42:01.248 --> 42:02.112
And if I fail

42:02.718 --> 42:04.430
all life on earth will come
to an end.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.188
What has that got to
do with the Arc?

42:07.506 --> 42:09.703
Something goes wrong with
the anomalies in this era.

42:09.823 --> 42:12.294
I'm here to find out what it is,
and if I can, stop it.

42:16.370 --> 42:18.612
So your whole identity is a lie

42:20.542 --> 42:23.527
and you've been investigating
us all since you got here.

42:24.330 --> 42:26.163
I think you can be
sure of Connor.

42:26.679 --> 42:28.391
Keep him on a tight
leash anyway.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.364
Till we can be certain
of his loyalty.

42:32.365 --> 42:33.184
Connor?

42:33.926 --> 42:36.062
I bet I need to know what
he's doing for Philip.

42:36.365 --> 42:37.487
You think it's him.

42:37.926 --> 42:41.244
Connors' data on anomaly convergence
is the last piece of the jigsaw.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.062
We're definitely close
to a breakthrough.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.572
I'm gonna show you something.

43:02.941 --> 43:04.729
What they're looking
at is your future.

43:10.939 --> 43:11.379
Ok.

43:28.323 --> 43:30.717
If you're going to be part of this, you
have to know what you're dealing with.

43:32.672 --> 43:34.005
I need you to help me.
