00:07.424 --> 00:08.425
Poppy?

00:10.844 --> 00:11.845
Poppy?

00:12.721 --> 00:14.348
Poppy, can you hear me?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.060
You hit your head, Poppy.

00:18.143 --> 00:22.689
I came to protect you. Did he hurt you?

00:22.773 --> 00:23.815
Who?

00:24.858 --> 00:28.445
He was in your house. I saw it.

00:28.987 --> 00:32.533
-Poppy, you hit your head.
-I saw… I saw…

01:45.606 --> 01:48.317
Nurse Wilkins to room 405.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.363
Daddy.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.740
Hey, sweetheart.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.910
Family going crazy trying
to find out what happened.

01:58.577 --> 01:59.786
How you feeling?

02:01.079 --> 02:02.247
Like hell.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.541
It's so good to see you awake.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.377
I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.380
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.800
The doctors want to keep you a
little while longer just for observation.

02:13.884 --> 02:18.514
Yeah, I called Des, and she's
gonna bring some of your things over.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.267
We'll be here with you till Ingram comes.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.729
Poppy?

02:27.397 --> 02:28.482
Where's your husband?

02:30.943 --> 02:31.944
Gone.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.198
-For good.
-What?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.283
Honey, I'm so sorry.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.496
-Why didn't you tell me?
-When did this happen?

02:42.579 --> 02:43.789
Today.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.626
Six months ago. A year ago.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.503
That's okay. Don't get yourself upset.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.463
I'm here. I'm here.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.220
She's got a concussion
and 13 stitches at your house.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.764
What was she doing up there
in the first place?

03:01.265 --> 03:03.517
She slipped on my deck, I guess.
I don't know.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.227
You weren't with her?

03:05.310 --> 03:08.272
I didn't know she was there. I was asleep.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.816
I heard her scream.
It scared the shit out of me.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.610
What else?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.280
I'm worried about her.

03:17.656 --> 03:21.326
You can't see it
because you need her to be okay.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.290
But she's been under a lot of strain
these last six months.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.875
Her marriage.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.254
Josh's death. The lawsuit.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.298
Your illness.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.137
-Shit.
-It's no wonder she hurt herself.

03:40.220 --> 03:45.267
She's coming loose at the seams,
and we all expect strong Poppy.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.477
-We depend on it. All of us.
-Wait, wait, wait.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.771
You think she did this on purpose?

03:50.814 --> 03:53.400
I think she's grieving and on edge.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.738
It's made her careless.

04:10.959 --> 04:11.960
Hello?

04:12.044 --> 04:14.463
He attacked me
and knocked me unconscious.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.339
Good evening, Ms. Parnell.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.301
I think he came after me
because I was onto him.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.385
Who?

04:20.469 --> 04:25.015
Holt. Holt Rollins at Micah's tonight.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.850
I thought he was assaulting her.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.478
And what did Micah say?

04:30.187 --> 04:33.190
She said that I slipped and hit my head.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.777
Wait, where are you?

04:36.860 --> 04:38.111
Hospital.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.863
Jesus. Why?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.448
Because I lost consciousness.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.033
Okay, listen.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.912
We have a search warrant
for Holt's place based on Markus

04:46.995 --> 04:49.915
seeing him flee the scene
of Ramon's death, okay?

04:50.666 --> 04:52.668
Now, we will find him,

04:52.751 --> 04:55.879
and we will question him
about your attack, okay?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.673
Thank you.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.050
Is that a baby?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.388
Yeah, that's my son.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.098
Who gave you a baby?

05:06.181 --> 05:07.975
Okay. Good night, Ms. Parnell.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.144
Wait. I'm scared.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.273
I know you are,

05:15.107 --> 05:17.776
and I am taking
what you told me very seriously.

05:17.860 --> 05:18.861
I promise you.

05:19.945 --> 05:20.946
Thank you.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.825
But I need you to do something for me.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.994
What?

05:27.661 --> 05:30.205
Just don't report this on your podcast.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.292
You believe me about Holt, right?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.378
Where'd he hit you?

05:37.462 --> 05:38.964
On the back of my head.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.595
So you didn't actually see him
or his face?

06:05.949 --> 06:06.950
What's wrong?

06:07.784 --> 06:09.536
I'm so sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.621
I--

06:12.706 --> 06:14.124
Can you give us a second?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.628
Lock the door.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.215
Lock the door and tell the nurses' desk
not to let anyone else in here.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.382
Okay.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.680
Well, this door does not have a lock.

06:29.264 --> 06:33.352
So maybe I can just
pop a chair against it?

06:34.269 --> 06:37.105
Just hand me my purse, please.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.076
Thanks.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.995
Is that one of Mama's?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.624
You have all of them? Grandmama's too?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.752
Yeah, Daddy gave them to me
when I left home.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.719
Daddy did that for her.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.389
They all have her name?

07:10.472 --> 07:13.016
Or his mother's, Eliza.

07:13.600 --> 07:18.397
She had a whole box
filled with evening bags.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.065
One for each bag.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.236
That's gangster.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.364
Like, I'm a lady,
but I will still fucking cut you.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.994
Words to live by.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.666
You know, I'm sorry about Ingram.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.835
I just think that--

08:51.615 --> 08:55.077
You can always tell
when the devil don't want somebody.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.329
How?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.499
You still here.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.157
Do you want me to stay a while?

09:35.450 --> 09:38.287
No. No, no thanks.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.999
I just want a bath and my own bed.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.422
Cydie's picking up your car from Micah,
so she'll be here in about an hour.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.424
And Lillian stress-cooked,

09:50.507 --> 09:53.260
so your fridge is stocked
with enough food for a siege.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.057
You know what?

10:00.893 --> 10:01.977
I'm hungry.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.063
I'm gonna stay till Cydie gets back.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.405
All right.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.825
Say what you wanna say.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.913
Fuck Ingram.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.042
The marriage breaking up
is not all his fault.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.251
So?

10:27.586 --> 10:28.670
You're my sister.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.383
I love you for that.

10:38.764 --> 10:43.894
So go get cleaned up,
and I will bring a plate up.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.481
Thanks.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.794
Lachlan, Micah wanted to see you.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.259
Blaine.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.265
What's going on?

11:22.683 --> 11:24.184
Well, I did warn you.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.270
Excuse me?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.105
I warned you that this was my company.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.651
And what that means, you slick fuck,
is that the only person profiting

11:32.734 --> 11:35.863
from my image, my stories,
my life, is going to be me.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.366
Micah, what are you talking about?

11:40.033 --> 11:44.121
You're blackmailing our people to
keep them quiet while you steal from us.

11:44.830 --> 11:49.710
Your company's in the red,
so you just skim off the top of Shelter

11:49.793 --> 11:51.879
trying to dig yourself out of a hole.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.424
You ratted me out.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.719
No, you are a rat. And she trapped you.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.849
So where do we go from here?

12:04.349 --> 12:05.392
You're gonna leave.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.021
You're gonna forfeit your shares
and your seat on the board.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.859
You heard the lady.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.069
It's time for you to go.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.909
Come on, Blaine.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.414
Don't make this shit weird.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.262
Don't ever lie to me again.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.080
Hey. It's about time.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.165
Why didn't you tell me
you were in the hospital?

13:10.249 --> 13:11.625
Didn't want to bother you.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.669
How could you bother me
when you hurt?

13:13.752 --> 13:14.753
Come on now.

13:15.254 --> 13:20.384
I was just trying to respect your
boundaries with the new baby and all.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.636
I'm home now anyway.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.137
You all right? You good?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.098
I've been better.

13:26.849 --> 13:30.018
All right, well then,
I'll leave it up to you then.

13:30.102 --> 13:32.020
You wanna rest
or you wanna get back to work?

13:32.104 --> 13:34.982
Work. I wanna work. What you got?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.192
Well, we had
an eventful morning over here.

13:37.276 --> 13:40.070
Micah fired Lachlan.
It was kinda dope, actually.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.031
It's about time. What happened?

13:43.115 --> 13:47.244
Well, apparently, surveillance wasn't
the only shit he was trying to pull,

13:47.327 --> 13:48.745
but he ain't coming back.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.291
Micah's cutting loose the people
around her she doesn't trust.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.836
You need to be careful, Markus.
Don't assume she has your back.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.213
Wait, what are you talking about?

13:58.714 --> 14:00.215
Just watch out.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.261
I think it was Holt that hit me.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.096
You think?

14:06.180 --> 14:08.849
Well, I was sure, but…

14:10.475 --> 14:13.604
now, everything's foggy.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.650
All right, well, look, then,
why don't you just get some rest, okay?

14:18.734 --> 14:20.027
Don't push too hard.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.029
I won't.

14:23.989 --> 14:24.990
Hey, Poppy.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.242
Yeah?

14:28.243 --> 14:30.621
You make sure
you take care of yourself, okay?

14:41.590 --> 14:42.591
Hey.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.761
Assholes.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.098
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on here?

14:50.599 --> 14:52.935
-End of the line, brother.
-What does that mean? Hey.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.234
-Watch your back.
-What's going on?

15:00.317 --> 15:02.277
-It's a purge.
-Why?

15:03.278 --> 15:05.614
Above my pay grade. Ask internal affairs.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.283
Okay, Haywood. What happened?

15:09.701 --> 15:11.245
They took me out, man.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.829
Of the Sons of Ivar?

15:12.913 --> 15:16.917
Took me off assignment,
so I quit 'cause fuck this place.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.670
They don't care about
the rank and file anymore.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.464
Listen to me, you watch your back.

15:22.548 --> 15:25.968
You're about as popular in there as I am.
Was.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.771
In the wake of Ramon's dramatic death,

15:38.647 --> 15:41.817
and the recent events
that have devastated Shelter,

15:42.776 --> 15:48.156
I was attacked at the home
of its founder, Micah Keith.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.329
A careless moment on my part
resulted in an injury

15:54.413 --> 15:58.000
and an overnight hospital stay.

16:13.223 --> 16:19.188
Is Holt Rollins, who's wanted for
questioning in the death of Ramon Tomas,

16:19.271 --> 16:23.066
the same person
who accosted me at the house?

16:23.859 --> 16:28.864
And is he the same person
who killed Joshua Keith and Drew Turney?

16:28.947 --> 16:31.241
-Want some company?
-Shit.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.536
What you doing in here by yourself?

16:35.245 --> 16:36.580
Shouldn't you be lying down?

16:38.373 --> 16:39.416
Too restless.

16:42.586 --> 16:46.131
And I wanted to record a podcast
about last night.

16:46.882 --> 16:47.883
But?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.427
But I don't know what happened to me.

16:51.261 --> 16:54.264
Am I supposed to just go on there
and start talking shit?

16:54.348 --> 16:55.724
Hasn't stopped you before.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.645
Stop.

17:02.356 --> 17:05.067
I think Micah is lying to me,
and I don't know why.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.277
So what do you wanna do?

17:08.612 --> 17:09.694
Talk to Micah?

17:13.659 --> 17:14.992
Knock, knock.

17:15.661 --> 17:19.248
The police are here looking
for information on Holt Rollins.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.376
That's that second chance guy
that does the dollhouses.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.794
You let them in?

17:24.670 --> 17:28.298
I wasn't exactly
in a position where I could--

17:29.591 --> 17:30.676
I didn't have a choice.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.471
Inspector Aames to see you.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.598
No, no-- I read the search warrant.

17:36.682 --> 17:39.935
It only includes the workshop
and the common work areas.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.019
She's right.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.147
Why don't I call someone here from legal?
Or Markus?

17:44.231 --> 17:45.232
It's fine.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.610
He's only here trying
to help us find Ramon's killer.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.072
Okay. I'll be right there.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.074
-Excuse me.
-Ivy.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.325
Yes.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.080
Right.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.332
Excuse me.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.045
Have you located Holt?

18:07.129 --> 18:11.049
Well, we tracked his cell phone
to the marina, but he ditched it.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.093
He gave it to a homeless person.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.305
What can I help you with?

18:17.222 --> 18:19.892
Well, we believe Holt Rollins killed Ramon

18:19.975 --> 18:22.603
because he was about
to release Shelter secrets.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.105
Your secrets.

18:25.731 --> 18:28.358
Well, if Holt had enough motive
to kill Ramon,

18:28.442 --> 18:30.527
then I'd have a motive as well.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.363
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.658
I'm an open book, Detective.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.702
I mean, literally.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.622
Here. And see for yourself.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.583
It's inspector.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.218
"Physical love is unthinkable
without violence."

18:54.927 --> 18:57.179
The Unbearable Lightness of Being.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.599
You believe it?

19:06.813 --> 19:10.442
So, Holt Rollins. Does he--
Does he have an office here?

19:12.152 --> 19:13.570
Only the workshop.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.030
Can I have a look at his file?

19:15.113 --> 19:17.157
His emergency contacts,
that kind of thing.

19:17.658 --> 19:21.328
I think the only paperwork independent
contractors have are tax forms,

19:21.411 --> 19:22.412
if that's okay?

19:22.496 --> 19:23.497
Sure.

19:25.040 --> 19:29.336
Is it illegal for me to give you
tax records without a warrant?

19:29.419 --> 19:30.420
Probably.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.844
But he's a very dangerous man,
according to your friend, Poppy Parnell.

19:40.097 --> 19:46.812
I founded this company on the belief that
we shouldn't be held hostage by our past.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.440
Mistakes and suffering creates grace.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.485
That's very pretty.

19:55.654 --> 19:59.116
Is that why you cut ties
with Lachlan Bray?

19:59.199 --> 20:00.909
Because he contacted me this morning.

20:00.993 --> 20:05.372
He was very disgruntled, and he told me,
if I ever needed anything, to just ask.

20:12.296 --> 20:14.047
I just want to find Holt Rollins.

20:15.549 --> 20:18.260
Poppy thinks that he attacked her.

20:57.883 --> 21:00.093
Where those hoops
I got you for your birthday?

21:01.803 --> 21:04.431
Probably in your room from
the last time you borrowed them.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.601
What's wrong?

21:10.187 --> 21:11.188
Look at the date.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.367
He drew these up six months ago.

21:24.368 --> 21:26.119
Was he trying to make it work or not?

21:26.203 --> 21:27.579
I don't know.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.670
I've watched you for the past six months,
biting your tongue,

21:34.753 --> 21:38.924
forcing yourself into a box like
you were auditioning for the role of wife.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.093
-That's not true.
-Well, if you say so.

21:41.176 --> 21:44.680
But trust me, being you is
more important than being married.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.725
-Look who's trying to grow up.
-Well…

21:53.105 --> 21:54.147
Shit.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.694
-We're gonna have to move out this house.
-If you don't get out of here…

21:58.777 --> 22:00.112
You always pushing me.

22:02.531 --> 22:03.907
I'll get that.

22:03.991 --> 22:07.160
One more thing, if we're not
gonna have a man up in here,

22:07.244 --> 22:08.912
-we need a dog. Come on.
-No.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.706
-No.
-Fine.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.049
-Hey, Daddy.
-Hey, baby.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.135
-Where's Pop?
-Upstairs.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.054
-Hey, Daddy.
-Hey, sweetheart.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.268
What's the creature feature
doing at my house?

22:31.351 --> 22:33.437
-Poppy.
-You got a lawsuit coming your way.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.397
I came to save the day.

22:36.148 --> 22:39.276
Oh, hell to the no.
I'm not hiring a shade tree lawyer.

22:39.359 --> 22:40.861
-See, I take offense.
-Poppy.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.782
You need help
with that wrongful death suit.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.743
He's never lost a case.

22:48.577 --> 22:51.038
He's represented me
and the MC for 20 years.

22:51.121 --> 22:54.625
I ain't been in jail since you was a kid,
and we all know I done did enough to--

22:54.708 --> 22:56.251
Come on now,
don't you finish that sentence.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.713
I can't stand him.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.882
But I bear you no ill will.

23:02.633 --> 23:04.635
I forgot he had
the hearing of a fucking bat.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.261
It's called sonar.

23:06.762 --> 23:10.516
It's a nice-ass house you have, Poppy.
Might have to reconsider my fees.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.352
-I don't need a lawyer.
-Poppy, enough.

23:14.603 --> 23:18.232
Ingram's gone.
You're gonna need help with that lawsuit.

23:18.315 --> 23:19.608
And the divorce.

23:20.776 --> 23:23.362
Wait, what? Since when?

23:23.445 --> 23:26.448
Divorce? I'm definitely upping my fees.

23:26.532 --> 23:28.200
He doesn't even own a shirt.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.619
Ha-ha. Fooled you. I own two.

23:32.287 --> 23:33.413
Look--

23:33.997 --> 23:37.459
You know what?
Poppy, you ready to give up this house?

23:39.253 --> 23:43.382
Let me guess, they're coming after you
with a claim of cyberbullying? Huh?

23:43.882 --> 23:47.052
Did they also include a cross-platform
claim about your website?

23:48.011 --> 23:50.055
Social media posts from your listeners?

23:51.473 --> 23:55.102
See, if I was representing the other side,
I would have included cyber harassment

23:55.769 --> 23:59.022
along with intentional infliction
of emotional distress.

23:59.106 --> 24:02.067
In order to get that punitive damages,
'cause that's where the big money is.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.361
Liability insurance don't
cover shit like that.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.738
No, it doesn't.
It's called outside the scope.

24:06.822 --> 24:08.115
And you know what it means?

24:08.198 --> 24:10.826
It means they come take this
fancy-ass house, garnish your wages

24:10.909 --> 24:14.288
and drive off in that little pretty
Alfa Romeo I saw parked out front.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.749
Slide that little ticktock
right off your wrist.

24:19.293 --> 24:21.086
That's my partner right there.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.048
So what do I do?

24:26.341 --> 24:27.384
You trust me.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.099
I listened to season one.

24:34.766 --> 24:37.978
Y'all did some good work,
but you were buck wild in your approach.

24:38.061 --> 24:41.106
I mean, y'all just came up in here
and said, "Fuck the rules," huh?

24:41.815 --> 24:43.942
-This is a critique?
-No, no, no.

24:44.026 --> 24:47.321
You two opened up a lot of doors for legal
trouble to just breeze right on in here.

24:48.322 --> 24:50.073
So, what do you recommend?

24:51.700 --> 24:53.118
What happened to you last night?

24:54.870 --> 24:56.121
He attacked me.

24:58.707 --> 24:59.958
You got proof?

25:00.918 --> 25:02.002
No.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.838
Then don't say a fucking word
about it on the podcast.

25:04.922 --> 25:07.591
You looking into any of the characters
from season one?

25:08.217 --> 25:10.093
-Yes.
-Cool.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.931
What happened to
the crazy twin's husband?

25:14.014 --> 25:16.725
-I ain't see him on the list.
-Alex Dunn?

25:16.808 --> 25:18.268
He's not doing so well.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.939
His daughter's living with his parents,
his house is in foreclosure,

25:22.022 --> 25:23.023
and he lost his job.

25:23.106 --> 25:25.859
Then we need to get
that motherfucker employed quick

25:25.943 --> 25:28.320
before opposing counsel
adds him to the lawsuit.

25:28.403 --> 25:31.949
I could check up on him.
Get the ball rolling. I don't mind.

25:36.453 --> 25:40.082
Aames is at Holt's place.
He's got something for me.

25:40.165 --> 25:42.292
-You're not going anywhere.
-I have to.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.546
-Then I'll drive.
-Let me change.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.053
Look.

25:53.136 --> 25:57.099
Okay, I know you're not feeling me,
all right, but I am good at what I do.

25:57.182 --> 25:58.183
Unmatched.

25:59.393 --> 26:01.061
So can I give you a little advice?

26:05.190 --> 26:08.735
They say criminal law is
bad people at their best,

26:08.819 --> 26:11.196
and divorce law is
good people at their worst.

26:11.864 --> 26:13.991
If you still love your husband,
you gonna keep trying to please him

26:14.074 --> 26:16.159
to get him back,
and he's gonna steamroll you.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.453
-That's not--
-Hey--

26:18.954 --> 26:21.331
You need to get a formal
separation agreement.

26:21.415 --> 26:23.542
Otherwise, he can go after
every single penny you make

26:23.625 --> 26:25.460
from now until the judge signs the decree.

26:25.544 --> 26:28.755
-Ingram would never do that.
-My dear, "never"?

26:29.464 --> 26:31.842
Never doesn't exist in a divorce.

26:33.552 --> 26:37.431
You know, when we were kids,
you used to always have your head stuck

26:37.514 --> 26:40.142
in those little romance novels
with the castles and knights

26:40.225 --> 26:42.477
and all that shit on the cover.
You remember that?

26:43.353 --> 26:45.898
Well, why don't we think
of a separation agreement

26:45.981 --> 26:49.526
as putting a moat
around your motherfucking money?

26:49.610 --> 26:50.611
All right?

26:52.070 --> 26:53.906
-All right.
-All right.

26:54.448 --> 26:56.783
Remember that?
I used to always beat you. Come on.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.620
-And I used to always beat you with this.
-Okay, all right, all right.

26:59.703 --> 27:02.372
You win, Princess Poppy. Away you go.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.173
Dollhouse freak cannot possibly live here.

27:11.256 --> 27:13.175
-Uh-uh.
-Go ahead.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.510
Thanks.

27:17.262 --> 27:21.558
-This is Holt Rollins's house?
-Is he a squatter?

27:21.642 --> 27:23.644
Deed's in his name. Paid cash.

27:24.228 --> 27:26.188
I got people tracing
where the money came from.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.983
-How's your head?
-Well, you're looking at it.

27:30.067 --> 27:31.151
How does it look to you?

27:33.028 --> 27:35.322
So, what you got for me?

27:35.405 --> 27:38.158
Well, the press are calling him
the "Keith Killer."

27:39.326 --> 27:43.288
No mention of Drew or Ramon,
the two dead gay boys.

27:43.372 --> 27:45.332
Guess they're not a big priority, right?

27:45.415 --> 27:48.627
Not like the famous husband
of a beautiful grief guru.

27:49.837 --> 27:52.965
Is that why you're
suddenly so collaborative?

27:53.882 --> 27:58.303
I have been kindly invited to fuck off
by various and sundry homicide cops.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.224
You know, this house is
kinda like your friend, Micah.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.601
It's pretty on the outside,
and on the inside it's…

28:05.269 --> 28:07.104
vacant, dark and kinda scary.

28:07.187 --> 28:09.106
That's what I've been fucking saying.

28:09.940 --> 28:12.484
Can I get you to say that
into the microphone?

28:13.110 --> 28:14.111
No.

28:15.070 --> 28:18.323
Now, the warrant also included
computers and cloud data,

28:18.407 --> 28:21.243
so why don't you take a gander?
And you never saw any of that.

28:22.828 --> 28:25.622
His search history is all about Micah.

28:25.706 --> 28:28.876
Those stories,
they date back over two decades.

28:30.294 --> 28:33.046
Micah must've had her suspicions.

28:33.130 --> 28:35.507
There's more. Keep going.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.977
Yeah, he's had you in his sights
for a while now.

28:52.274 --> 28:55.652
Holt built a dollhouse of
Joshua's murder right after it happened.

28:56.153 --> 28:58.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.489
Hold this.

29:00.866 --> 29:03.702
Markus took a picture
of the same dollhouse

29:03.785 --> 29:05.204
when you raided Holt's workshop.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.874
These don't match.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.172
Why would the color change in a week?

29:17.382 --> 29:18.759
Check the paint on the door.

29:39.321 --> 29:40.531
You again.

29:40.614 --> 29:42.032
Yeah, me again.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.662
-Noa Havilland.
-Alex Dunn. How can I help you?

29:47.579 --> 29:48.914
I'm here to help you.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.626
But first, let me tell you
how we know each other.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.839
So… the results came back this afternoon

29:56.922 --> 30:01.677
from that paint on the dollhouse door,
and guess what?

30:02.177 --> 30:04.930
You were right. It ain't paint.

30:05.013 --> 30:06.974
Blood? Lord.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.184
Do they know whose it is?

30:09.685 --> 30:11.061
Holt Rollins.

30:11.144 --> 30:14.648
It matched the blood they found
at Ramon's apartment.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.442
So you need to be careful.
Is Ingram there with you?

30:18.026 --> 30:21.113
He's out of town, on business.

30:21.196 --> 30:24.575
But don't worry.
Daddy sent some guys from the MC.

30:24.658 --> 30:26.869
-Good.
-And plus…

30:26.952 --> 30:29.162
Cydie's tried to use this to get a dog.

30:30.247 --> 30:31.456
Of course she is.

30:37.921 --> 30:43.093
You know, Micah saved my life,
when we were kids.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.597
-What? What happened?
-Dad?

30:47.598 --> 30:48.599
Oh, shit.

30:48.682 --> 30:52.227
-Go. I'll call you later.
-I'm coming, baby.

30:52.936 --> 30:53.937
Are you sure?

30:54.021 --> 30:55.063
Yeah.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.025
Well, when you say it like that…

30:58.817 --> 31:01.528
-Dad. Come in here. I need your help.
-Okay. Okay, one second.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.238
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

31:04.198 --> 31:05.199
Go on.

31:05.282 --> 31:08.577
Be with your family.
I'll call you tomorrow.

31:09.328 --> 31:10.954
All right, I'll talk to you later.

31:12.748 --> 31:13.832
What do you want, girl?

31:56.667 --> 32:00.128
You're supposed to say sorry
when you bump into somebody.

32:00.212 --> 32:01.839
Little girl, do you hear me?

32:09.972 --> 32:12.933
I'm Mikey. What's your name?

32:19.648 --> 32:20.983
Really?

32:28.282 --> 32:29.324
Come with me.

32:56.810 --> 32:59.104
You wanna know a dirty little secret?

32:59.688 --> 33:01.690
Shreve Scoville.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.861
Shreve is a liar.

33:12.993 --> 33:14.661
What the hell are you doing down here?

33:14.745 --> 33:17.748
You carry your ass
right upstairs, right now!

33:28.967 --> 33:30.969
Poppy. Over here.

33:55.369 --> 33:56.828
You can't talk, right?

34:00.624 --> 34:02.042
Then I'll scream for you.

34:47.629 --> 34:48.630
Hi.

34:48.714 --> 34:50.716
Hey, you awake?

34:52.717 --> 34:54.678
I'm just-- I've been…

34:56.013 --> 35:00.142
dreaming about when we were kids,
and I lost my voice.

35:00.642 --> 35:03.478
When I was staying with Miss Shirley.

35:04.771 --> 35:06.315
What brought this up?

35:07.316 --> 35:08.317
Nothing.

35:09.943 --> 35:10.986
Everything.

35:13.488 --> 35:17.826
I went six months without talking
before I met you.

35:19.578 --> 35:23.707
I just remember
how angry my silence made people.

35:25.334 --> 35:26.752
"It's all in her head."

35:27.628 --> 35:29.630
"She's just doing it for attention."

35:30.881 --> 35:32.591
"She'll talk when she's ready."

35:34.009 --> 35:35.052
And you did.

35:36.220 --> 35:39.139
You grew up to become
one of the loudest voices in our country.

35:44.645 --> 35:45.896
I love you, Micah.

35:51.443 --> 35:52.444
I love you too.

36:12.673 --> 36:15.300
That is a terrified young girl in there.

36:16.301 --> 36:20.597
Thirteen years old.
Left to survive on her own.

36:21.932 --> 36:23.851
Forgotten. A discard.

36:25.310 --> 36:28.272
And still survived.

36:28.939 --> 36:31.692
And so, I wrote myself into existence.

36:33.235 --> 36:34.778
To keep from disappearing.

36:51.837 --> 36:52.838
Got you.

37:02.806 --> 37:04.349
You were always such a lightweight.

37:07.978 --> 37:08.979
Rose.

37:11.356 --> 37:12.858
What are you doing here?

37:14.401 --> 37:16.069
I came to take you home.

37:19.114 --> 37:20.115
Two more.

37:32.127 --> 37:33.795
Reggae works like a charm.

37:35.964 --> 37:37.174
That's sweet.

37:43.597 --> 37:44.806
Let me guess…

37:46.600 --> 37:48.644
you came here to warn me about Micah.

37:58.111 --> 38:01.323
Think of this as a trust exercise
between you and me.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.159
-So my little speech worked?
-We'll see.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.126
She lied.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.671
Micah bought the house for Holt.

38:16.797 --> 38:19.675
Your friend is now officially
a suspect in all three murders.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.730
Hey, is everything okay?

39:14.813 --> 39:17.024
Yeah, sorry.

39:17.107 --> 39:22.237
I know it's late, but do you think
we could meet somewhere and talk?

39:22.863 --> 39:23.906
Of course.

39:45.761 --> 39:47.262
-Hi.
-Hey.

39:49.973 --> 39:50.974
Couldn't sleep?

39:59.107 --> 40:00.817
I'm so sorry about Ingram.

40:03.362 --> 40:05.113
Where's Holt, Micah?

40:08.200 --> 40:10.035
I don't know. Did you check his house?

40:10.118 --> 40:11.537
The one you paid for?

40:14.331 --> 40:16.583
The police will find him eventually.

40:18.585 --> 40:19.711
Maybe they won't.

40:22.005 --> 40:26.218
Are you still going to lie to my face
that he wasn't the man you were with?

40:26.301 --> 40:27.761
The man who attacked me?

40:28.262 --> 40:33.475
Holt gets out of jail, having tracked you
the entire time he was inside.

40:34.184 --> 40:35.727
Then you buy him a house.

40:35.811 --> 40:41.441
It's almost as if, I don't know,
you've known him much longer.

40:42.234 --> 40:44.778
Maybe you met him
when you were living on the streets.

40:48.115 --> 40:49.700
Why did he kill Ramon?

40:50.701 --> 40:52.786
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:53.787 --> 40:55.539
Did you ask him to do it?

40:57.040 --> 40:58.125
Coffee, tea?

40:59.293 --> 41:00.711
I'm fine, thank you.

41:04.548 --> 41:05.966
Was it your idea?

41:06.466 --> 41:09.178
I would never hurt Ramon.

41:10.429 --> 41:11.763
He was family.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.724
And you don't know who killed Josh?

41:13.807 --> 41:14.892
Of course not.

41:18.353 --> 41:22.900
I loved my husband,
but I never pretended to be perfect.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.944
But you pretended.

41:29.573 --> 41:30.616
What about you?

41:33.410 --> 41:36.705
-Are your hands clean?
-Cleaner than yours.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.959
I bet Miss Shirley would feel differently.

41:43.504 --> 41:45.839
You tried to make me feel crazy.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.467
Tried to gaslight me.

41:50.302 --> 41:51.428
You recording?

41:54.056 --> 41:55.182
Are you recording?

41:57.476 --> 42:00.312
Did you tell Holt to attack me?

42:07.027 --> 42:08.987
We thought you were an intruder.

42:20.499 --> 42:25.003
What was Josh going to tell me that night?
You had him killed before he could say.

42:25.087 --> 42:26.421
Fuck off.

42:28.173 --> 42:30.884
Joshua meant everything to me.
I had nothing to do with that.

42:31.593 --> 42:33.178
I don't believe you.

42:35.764 --> 42:37.057
I don't give a shit.

42:37.975 --> 42:41.103
Why did you even want me
involved with this case?

42:41.186 --> 42:44.481
I wanna know who murdered my husband.
I still do.

42:45.065 --> 42:46.316
No.

42:48.193 --> 42:51.655
You used me.
Just like you use everyone around you.

42:52.698 --> 42:56.910
You thought that you could control
what I put out there, and you were right.

42:57.494 --> 42:58.495
For a while.

42:59.580 --> 43:01.874
I held back when I shouldn't have.

43:02.708 --> 43:06.295
I waited too long on some things
and didn't push harder on others, like…

43:08.422 --> 43:12.342
What does Holt Rollins really mean to you?

43:14.845 --> 43:17.598
It is possible
to love more than one person.

43:19.725 --> 43:21.810
You of all people should know that.

43:29.526 --> 43:31.028
What's the matter, Poppy?

43:33.238 --> 43:34.865
You lost your voice again?

43:36.742 --> 43:38.619
I will destroy you.

43:41.038 --> 43:42.122
You can try.
