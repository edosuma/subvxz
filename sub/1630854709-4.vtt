00:14.919 --> 00:17.036
To get your driving license,

00:17.120 --> 00:18.955
the first thing you need to do

00:19.039 --> 00:22.076
is to memorize the highway code

00:22.160 --> 00:25.196
or be lucky enough to get
questions you know the answer to.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.595
While you learn the highway code,

00:28.679 --> 00:32.359
at driving school you'll be taught how
to operate a vehicle:

00:32.679 --> 00:36.756
what the brakes are for,
the accelerator, the gear box

00:36.840 --> 00:40.315
and above all you'll learn how to park.

00:40.399 --> 00:43.355
When your instructor is confident
that you are ready,

00:43.439 --> 00:45.955
you'll do your exam.
And with a little luck,

00:46.039 --> 00:49.595
you'll pass
on your fourth or fifth attempt.

00:49.679 --> 00:53.359
And you will think,
you know how to drive.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.395
However, this is when

00:57.479 --> 01:00.560
the real and dangerous lessons begin.

01:10.439 --> 01:13.836
- This isn't a coffee.
- Of course it isn't, it's linden tea.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.435
Everybody has a linden tea
before their practical,

01:16.519 --> 01:18.836
- for the nerves.
- I'm not nervous.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.319
I'm seeing what it's like.
I'm sure I'll fail.

01:21.959 --> 01:24.875
You're right, it's just hot water.
This is useless.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.959
The little white box in there, it helps.

01:29.159 --> 01:33.075
Benzodiazepines? Serious?
You want me to get into an accident?

01:33.159 --> 01:35.036
- They're not that strong.
- Sure.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.235
There is stronger stuff, like heroin.

01:37.319 --> 01:40.155
- Drama queen.
- I told you if I flunk, I don't care.

01:40.239 --> 01:42.599
We won't hear the end of it if you flunk.

01:43.519 --> 01:46.000
Lorenzo says all you need for the test

01:46.480 --> 01:49.000
is a pair of good shoes and your ID.

01:49.879 --> 01:52.529
Knowing how to drive should also
come in handy, right?

01:55.799 --> 01:58.435
- Turn around.
- Why? I can't right here.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.769
Turn around, I forgot my ID.
Whenever you can.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.200
Oh no, I have it.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.116
Oh, those nerves.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.719
I'm not nervous.
I don't need to take anything.

02:10.719 --> 02:11.840
What are you doing?

02:15.120 --> 02:17.756
- Don't, we'll have an accident.
- It's fine, don't you worry.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.596
I take one every night
to be able to sleep.

02:20.680 --> 02:23.515
But right now,
it's not like you're going to bed.

02:23.599 --> 02:25.240
Honestly, it's not a problem.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.680
How long have you been on these?

02:30.719 --> 02:34.759
Four months? Six? A year? Not sure.

02:38.520 --> 02:44.680
I DON'T LIKE DRIVING

02:49.400 --> 02:50.960
Pablo, the other day I lied.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.080
I lied. I talk about you in therapy.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.080
Straighten up. We're almost there.

02:58.479 --> 03:02.319
How am I not going to speak about you,
of us, our break-up?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.276
I talk about a lot of stuff,
loads of stuff,

03:06.360 --> 03:09.199
but I also talk about you, about us.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.240
Because we get along really well.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.395
We got along really well
when we were together.

03:15.479 --> 03:18.355
- Yup. Keep your eyes forward.
- Of course.

03:18.439 --> 03:20.919
But we didn't have a real relationship.

03:21.919 --> 03:24.276
Not even now... now we are friends.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.879
We have an odd relationship.

03:27.479 --> 03:29.075
Look forward.

03:29.159 --> 03:31.276
We've split up, but we still hang out.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.280
I drive you around everywhere.

03:34.919 --> 03:36.675
We don't have sex,

03:36.759 --> 03:39.639
we didn't have much sex when
we were together either.

03:41.199 --> 03:43.355
Now everything is like it used to be,

03:43.439 --> 03:46.400
we tease each other,
lots of hee-hee's, lots of ha-ha's,

03:48.120 --> 03:50.120
but when it boils down to it...

03:50.719 --> 03:52.360
When it boils down to it what?

03:53.520 --> 03:55.120
I'm tired, Pablo.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.395
But it's normal, Iria,
you just took a Xanax.

03:59.479 --> 04:00.960
It's not that.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.080
Honestly, you understand what you want.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.395
Maybe it's not the best time
to talk about this.

04:07.479 --> 04:10.679
- Let's wait until after the exam.
- Of course, whatever you say.

04:12.479 --> 04:14.080
Hee-hee, ha-ha.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.560
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine, you?

04:29.279 --> 04:32.036
Well, I'm a little worried now,
to be honest.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.156
You should have had that linden tea.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.235
And you shouldn't have had that Xanax.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.839
I take one every day.
It's not a big deal if I take two today.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.920
- Good luck with the test.
- It's fine, I'm not going to pass.

04:46.399 --> 04:49.480
Yeah, yeah.
It not being a big deal is bullshit.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.020
I'll be done by 11.
I'll wait here for you?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.195
Did Lucia get a new car?

05:22.279 --> 05:24.195
That wasn't Lucía, it was my dad.

05:24.279 --> 05:28.040
Your dad? And he took off?
I would have liked to say hello.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.639
You don't prefer the mystery?

05:32.079 --> 05:33.516
The mystery?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.396
What if you meet him
and it's a disappointment.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.639
Why would I be disappointed?
Does he eat little children?

05:40.319 --> 05:42.115
That's right, he eats kids.

05:42.199 --> 05:44.516
Every night he gets into
his fancy SUV you saw

05:44.600 --> 05:47.476
and goes out hunting for kids.
Sometimes he finds

05:47.560 --> 05:50.076
stray kids, but he also

05:50.160 --> 05:52.396
snatches them through open windows,

05:52.480 --> 05:53.879
to eat them of course.

05:54.319 --> 05:57.879
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm very nervous about the exam.

05:58.319 --> 06:00.596
And that's how you get
when you're nervous?

06:00.680 --> 06:04.156
Like what? Cynical? Unbearable? Sullen?

06:04.240 --> 06:07.199
- Rude.
- Yes, every time.

06:07.959 --> 06:10.240
And you? You're not nervous?

06:10.839 --> 06:12.836
I'm just sightseeing here.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.555
- I'm here to try it out.
- You're not going to pass.

06:15.639 --> 06:17.156
No, I know I won't pass.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.036
Pass meaning,
I'm here to give it a go, not to pass.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.995
...nervous. So, let's keep calm.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.675
Seriously,
there are a lot of roundabouts,

06:26.759 --> 06:28.716
a lot to look out for... finally.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.396
- Yoli, what's that you've got there?
- What?

06:31.480 --> 06:33.355
- What's on your forehead?
- Where?

06:33.439 --> 06:35.276
On your forehead. Wait, here...
What's this?

06:35.360 --> 06:38.755
- What's this. An "L"!
- For loser?

06:38.839 --> 06:42.636
Nonsense! "L" for License.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.995
You're going to pass and nail it, sweetie.

06:45.079 --> 06:48.276
Professor, what a surprise!
Well, not really,

06:48.360 --> 06:49.875
I saw your name on the list.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.315
Surprised to see you on the list.
But eyes open, eyes wide open.

06:53.399 --> 06:55.555
Very good, I think it's a great idea.

06:55.639 --> 06:57.435
I'm serious. Good that you came

06:57.519 --> 06:59.396
to see the exam, even if you fail.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.675
That's right, I'm here to try my luck.

07:01.759 --> 07:04.836
Careful,
this has nothing to do with luck.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.970
Either, you know your stuff or you don't.

07:07.319 --> 07:09.716
This is make-or-break.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.800
Yeah.

07:11.279 --> 07:13.795
I didn't know there was
an exact science to driving.

07:13.879 --> 07:15.315
Very exact.

07:15.399 --> 07:18.836
So exact that if you fail on the road,

07:18.920 --> 07:21.076
it's only your life on the line.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.836
But rest assured,
I'm here to keep you out of danger.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.480
But when you pass,
you're on your own and then...

07:28.920 --> 07:32.000
But don't fret about it,
because you're going to flunk.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.959
Well...

07:34.959 --> 07:37.109
- Maybe I'll pass.
- It doesn't look likely.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.720
- I might.
- I doubt it.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.396
- We'll see.
- No because it doesn't look like...

07:42.480 --> 07:44.036
I thought I could sign up.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.639
Oh, should have, would have, could have.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.875
Do I have time to go to the loo?

07:50.959 --> 07:53.195
I drank like eight 'sleepy' teas today.

07:53.279 --> 07:55.755
- Did it work?
- To calm me down? No.

07:55.839 --> 07:59.276
But to go to the bathroom yes.
Are the examiners coming?

07:59.360 --> 08:03.399
Hold it, Yoli.
Because speak of the devil.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.680
Guerrero. A real sourpuss.
He flunks everybody.

08:09.639 --> 08:12.480
Vizcarra. He's retiring in two months.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.596
He could care less. Instant pass.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.235
Zúñiga. Super demanding.

08:18.319 --> 08:20.439
Very strict, but fair.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.920
And that's who we're stuck with.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.160
Oh.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.720
Let's see.
Yolanda Macías and Pablo Lopetegui.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.480
Show me where the reflective vest goes.

08:45.159 --> 08:46.200
Here.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.399
Correct.

08:49.679 --> 08:51.320
You, lift the hood.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.320
Point out
the windshield wiper fluid reservoir.

09:20.879 --> 09:23.360
The windshield wiper fluid reservoir.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.240
Correct.

09:29.799 --> 09:31.200
Who wants to start?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.876
Drive on your own for a few minutes

09:54.960 --> 09:58.200
and then I'll begin giving you directions.
Whenever you're ready.

10:10.399 --> 10:13.036
Just like me.
It happened to me this morning.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.996
It stalled on me too.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.080
Don't worry. Proceed.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.195
I'll give you directions now.
At the roundabout

10:36.279 --> 10:39.075
we take the second exit
as if to turn to the left,

10:39.159 --> 10:40.919
not including the restricted one.

11:02.039 --> 11:05.279
Now let's look for a space along
this street to parallel park.

11:10.919 --> 11:11.960
This one will do.

11:13.559 --> 11:14.799
- Here?
- Yes.

11:22.879 --> 11:23.960
OK.

11:51.399 --> 11:54.159
Wheel to the curb,
license in your pocket.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.600
Very good. Turn off the engine
and let's change drivers.

12:17.039 --> 12:18.840
Your exam has concluded.

12:19.159 --> 12:20.480
Thank you.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.600
Start driving.

13:15.399 --> 13:17.756
It stalled on Lorenzo this morning too.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.960
Start driving.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.960
You said it earlier, right?

13:51.960 --> 13:55.516
- Merge on or this exam is over.
- There's no room to maneuver.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.120
Eyes forward, don't look back.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.039
I repeat, merge onto the road
or this exam is over.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.756
Very good, now follow my directions.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.799
Second exit at the roundabout.

14:22.399 --> 14:24.156
Did you say the second exit?

14:24.240 --> 14:26.440
Yes, the second exit off the roundabout.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.396
Unnecessary delay at
the roundabout is also a penalization.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.360
It's considered a mistake.
Two mistakes and you've failed.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.480
What happened?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.200
What's that? What happened?

15:24.799 --> 15:26.080
What happened?

15:37.480 --> 15:38.955
Lopetegui, get out.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.799
After I give my feedback to Macías,
I'll get to you.

15:50.679 --> 15:52.116
How did it go?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.516
What's the beeping device
during the exam?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.315
- The horn?
- Not the horn,

15:56.399 --> 15:58.715
it beeps, it's a loud as hell sound.

15:58.799 --> 16:02.276
You mean the monitor. It goes off
if the teacher uses the pedals.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.555
- And why would he use the pedals?
- So you don't crash.

16:05.639 --> 16:08.399
- And if he uses them... you fail.
- Automatic fail.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.236
And now he's going to tell me I flunked?

16:11.320 --> 16:13.075
No, they don't tell you anything.

16:13.159 --> 16:16.116
But people who flunked
would get pissed off with the examiner.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.675
Relatives would show up to beat him up.

16:18.759 --> 16:20.080
OK.

16:21.759 --> 16:23.555
How did it go?

16:23.639 --> 16:25.356
Not sure, I thought I did OK,

16:25.440 --> 16:27.315
but then he told me my mistakes.

16:27.399 --> 16:30.795
Yolanda, please. Don't tell me
you're one of those who say

16:30.879 --> 16:33.195
"I've failed" and then aces it, please.

16:33.279 --> 16:35.600
No, you find out later
if you've passed or not.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.876
That's so you don't beat him up.

16:38.960 --> 16:39.960
What?

16:41.919 --> 16:44.675
Just one thing. I've flunked, right?

16:44.759 --> 16:47.475
Come in and I'll point out
the mistakes you've made.

16:47.559 --> 16:49.795
No, just tell me if I've flunked.

16:49.879 --> 16:51.795
Professor. Come in and have a seat.

16:51.879 --> 16:54.195
Lopetegui, you were not ready
for the exam.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.595
And yes you've failed.

16:55.679 --> 16:58.629
If the instructor uses his pedal
it's an automatic fail, OK?

17:03.799 --> 17:04.839
Professor!

17:08.720 --> 17:10.920
Hi, this is Iria. Leave a message.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.880
Where are you? I'm done
and I'm waiting here for you.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.279
And... whatever, as expected, I failed.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.319
But no big deal...

17:22.599 --> 17:24.636
Call me, I'm a bit worried.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.799
I hope you're OK. Kisses. Bye.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.559
What?

17:36.319 --> 17:39.475
Professor,
need a ride back to civilization?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.920
- Yes, they're picking me up.
- Are you sure?

17:43.759 --> 17:46.916
- Pretty sure.
- Well, come with us.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.156
It's not necessary.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.839
Come on, get in
so you're not left here stranded.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.116
Come on, you're driving.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.235
Free class, yes.

17:59.319 --> 18:02.079
It'll come in handy for the next exam.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
Come on.

18:10.359 --> 18:12.715
All I'm saying is that

18:12.799 --> 18:15.839
it was wrong to take off
without listening to the examiner.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.675
It's not like you were going
to change his mind or anything.

18:19.759 --> 18:22.799
But imagine you're stuck with Zúñiga
on the next road exam.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.796
Maybe he'll have it in for you.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.876
Hasn't that ever happened with a student?

18:26.960 --> 18:28.796
Same thing here.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.755
For example,
there's this student of mine,

18:31.839 --> 18:34.356
who I can't stand,
she really gets on my nerves.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.440
- Who is it?
- You!

18:37.359 --> 18:40.715
I knew you'd fall for it, Espe.
I knew it.

18:40.799 --> 18:43.035
I'm joking, you're one of my favorites.

18:43.119 --> 18:45.636
I'm going to be sad
to see you go when you pass.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.035
Ninth time is a charm.

18:47.119 --> 18:49.836
Ninth, ninth.
Beethoven's symphony number nine

18:49.920 --> 18:52.435
is exactly what the professor
performed today.

18:52.519 --> 18:55.755
He started talking to Zúñiga
in the middle of the exam!

18:55.839 --> 18:58.480
To Juan Francisco "The Rock" Zúñiga!

18:58.880 --> 19:00.715
You have to know when to shut up,
professor.

19:00.799 --> 19:04.515
Are you serious? Are you lecturing me
about not shutting up?

19:04.599 --> 19:07.156
An examiner is never spoken to.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.636
I said the space was tight.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.475
The very same space
in which Yoli executed

19:11.559 --> 19:14.636
perfect parallel parking
and I take my hat off, Yoli.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.755
Now, if a car can get in,
it can certainly get out.

19:17.839 --> 19:19.235
I was just commenting.

19:19.319 --> 19:21.715
Listen, I'm rarely quiet.

19:21.799 --> 19:24.396
During exams, I'm more handsome
when I pipe down.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.195
You weren't that quiet when
the car stalled on Yoli.

19:27.279 --> 19:29.076
When it happened to me not a beep,

19:29.160 --> 19:31.235
not a word, not even a sound.

19:31.319 --> 19:35.515
Professor,
I had already played that card.

19:35.599 --> 19:38.235
OK. I'm going to make
a formal complaint to the DfT,

19:38.319 --> 19:40.515
get them to forget this exam
and re-do it.

19:40.599 --> 19:43.675
Look, lodging a complaint
about Zúñiga is pointless.

19:43.759 --> 19:47.475
No, I'm not going to lodge one against
Zúñiga, I'm lodging it against you.

19:47.559 --> 19:49.960
Why not a heads-up about
the beeping pedals?

19:50.839 --> 19:53.275
You used them? Why did you even use them?

19:53.359 --> 19:56.195
You were about to plow
into another vehicle

19:56.279 --> 19:59.596
who was going around the roundabout.
My goodness.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.076
No. That's wrong.
I had it all under control,

20:02.160 --> 20:03.675
you made me flunk.

20:03.759 --> 20:08.435
Pablo, whenever you drive, I'm always
using the passenger-side pedals.

20:08.519 --> 20:11.076
I warned you
that you weren't ready for the test,

20:11.160 --> 20:13.195
but we can't beat your stubbornness.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.720
During the lessons,
the pedals don't beep.

20:16.319 --> 20:18.796
Here I was,
thinking I was learning to drive

20:18.880 --> 20:21.356
and actually it was you
fiddling with the pedals.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.995
You're releasing
that clutch too fast, professor.

20:25.079 --> 20:28.475
Right now... I just used the pedals,
and you haven't even noticed.

20:28.559 --> 20:30.316
Why? You don't listen to the car.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.480
Can you please shut the hell up!

20:33.559 --> 20:37.556
You're a pain in the ass, Lorenzo,
a royal pain in the ass!

20:37.640 --> 20:40.275
All day there... Tatatatata.

20:40.359 --> 20:42.876
Go back and be a cab driver
so you can yap away!

20:42.960 --> 20:44.675
Seriously, please.

20:44.759 --> 20:47.515
And I'm going
to lodge a complaint to the DfT.

20:47.599 --> 20:49.116
I'm sending a letter to them

20:49.200 --> 20:52.359
so that you're banned from
teaching driving ever again.

20:56.519 --> 20:58.640
And one more thing,

20:59.279 --> 21:02.715
I've taken so many lessons
and you haven't taught me anything.

21:02.799 --> 21:05.999
And why? You're not an educator
nor nothing else for that matter.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.440
I'm late!

21:51.279 --> 21:54.396
Sorry I'm late.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.000
Something came up.

22:01.079 --> 22:03.079
Let's see, where were we...?

22:04.119 --> 22:06.916
Sorry. All done.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.596
No. Check it.
It might be your road test result.

22:11.680 --> 22:15.000
We're all interested to know if you've
passed or failed, Macías.

22:19.359 --> 22:20.480
And?

22:23.119 --> 22:24.640
I passed.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.720
I'll be right back.

22:59.240 --> 23:02.640
Pop quiz. Books off the tables.

23:06.839 --> 23:09.275
Four questions...
Take one then pass the rest.

23:09.359 --> 23:11.316
Topics we've already covered in class.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.720
- You can't do this.
- You have an hour.

23:16.759 --> 23:18.675
Say something, school counselor.

23:18.759 --> 23:20.715
- What do I say?
- That he can't do this.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.715
We already told him that.

23:22.799 --> 23:23.720
Quiet!

23:27.240 --> 23:29.200
You have one hour.

23:42.799 --> 23:45.440
Pen's down. Your hour is up.

23:54.119 --> 23:55.599
Yolanda.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.240
This isn't like driving school.

23:59.119 --> 24:01.636
Any idiot who can turn
a steering wheel can pass.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.470
This is a uni degree, don't forget.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.440
- I know.
- Being someone's "daughter" means nothing.

24:08.559 --> 24:11.279
Your father, no matter who,
won't get you a degree.

24:11.960 --> 24:15.316
- I know.
- Maybe you're not aware of something.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.519
Like what?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.839
That talent is not inherited.

25:24.759 --> 25:29.519
Calm down, I'm fine.
I don't feel like talking that's all.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.039
YOLANDA MACÍAS - A
