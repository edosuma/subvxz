11:58.475 --> 12:00.575
Have you spoken to him?

12:00.577 --> 12:02.044
About what happened?

12:02.046 --> 12:04.880
Yes. He doesn't remember much.

12:04.882 --> 12:08.050
You should be here with him.

12:08.052 --> 12:09.318
Which hospital?

12:09.320 --> 12:11.286
We're on the post-op
floor, Toronto General,

12:11.288 --> 12:12.854

I know that you would do

13:10.312 --> 13:11.911
Santos asked to meet me.

13:18.052 --> 13:19.886
You know I can't let you do that.

13:22.022 --> 13:23.957

- You're locking me in?
- Until this is done.

Jeremy, I was trying to save Clay!

13:33.101 --> 13:35.000
So am I.

13:35.002 --> 13:37.903
And I cannot let you compromise
my negotiations with Santos.

13:37.905 --> 13:39.771
Please don't do this.

13:39.773 --> 13:43.309
I let you go to Toronto because I
thought that you would be safe.

13:43.311 --> 13:45.010
And I was wrong.

13:45.012 --> 13:48.114
And I know that you would
do anything to help Clay.

The only place that I can
keep you safe is in here.

13:50.718 --> 13:52.951
I know what you're doing, Jeremy.

13:52.953 --> 13:55.286
You think if you offer yourself
for Clay, you can end this.

13:55.288 --> 13:57.589
But you can't trust Santos.

13:57.591 --> 13:59.992
He could kill you and Clay.

14:03.395 --> 14:05.697
I know.

14:05.699 --> 14:07.499
I don't trust Santos.

14:09.468 --> 14:13.304
But right now the most important
thing for me is to protect you.

14:13.306 --> 14:14.739
From yourself.

14:17.943 --> 14:20.077
Nick and I will deal with this.

How are you feeling?

Ohh... better.

14:58.203 --> 15:00.803
How are you holding up?

I'm okay, given the circumstances.

- He's right.

15:07.145 --> 15:09.178
Then why don't I feel safe?

Those people that attacked us,

they can't hurt us here.

It'll never happen.

loyal Pack member, Clayton.

Always doing Jeremy's bidding.

Like when you killed my brother.

Let me ask you:

15:56.059 --> 15:58.092
how did it feel to kill Stephen

15:58.094 --> 16:00.261
at Jeremy's behest?

16:00.263 --> 16:02.496
As good as it will when I kill you.

Hm.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.766
Wrong answer.

What's the status on Jeremy's injuries?

16:14.610 --> 16:18.045
Is he fully recovered from our
little roadside surprise?

16:18.047 --> 16:20.113
Strong enough to take on Koenig

16:20.115 --> 16:22.450
with enough left to kick your ass.

16:22.452 --> 16:23.751
(Grunt)

16:23.753 --> 16:25.853
The Pack is falling apart

16:25.855 --> 16:27.655

16:27.657 --> 16:31.524
The only thing left in your
future is more of this.

16:33.428 --> 16:36.196
You're getting carried away, Daniel.

16:36.198 --> 16:40.033
This has nothing to do
with bringing down Jeremy.

16:40.035 --> 16:41.668
This has everything to do with a history

16:41.670 --> 16:44.571
of you watching Clay get
everything you ever wanted:

16:44.573 --> 16:46.739
status in the Pack...

16:46.741 --> 16:48.942

You know, I've been keeping
a close eye on Elena

17:04.791 --> 17:06.959
these past few weeks.

17:06.961 --> 17:09.362
You should have seen her at
Philip's sister's wedding.

17:09.364 --> 17:12.999
Trying to lead a normal life.

17:13.001 --> 17:15.367
But you and I both know

17:15.369 --> 17:17.435
that isn't really Elena.

17:17.438 --> 17:19.738
I bet she'd give it all up
just to save you.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.340
In fact, I'm counting on it.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.545
Elena doesn't know this yet, but...

17:26.547 --> 17:28.246
when I get my hands

17:28.248 --> 17:31.249
on her perfect body,

And I anticipate

17:41.661 --> 17:44.962
having a very big family.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.964
We're going to be very, very busy.

Where's Rachel?

18:20.066 --> 18:22.266
She's taking a nap in Elena's room.

Just trying to keep her
from wandering around.

18:32.743 --> 18:34.811
Thank you...

18:34.813 --> 18:36.345
for saving my life, Jeremy.

18:37.682 --> 18:40.817
And I'm sorry I wasn't
here when you needed me.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.585
I understand.

18:44.821 --> 18:46.755
(Laugh)

18:46.757 --> 18:48.991
It's been so long since
we've had a little one

18:48.993 --> 18:51.094
roaming the grounds at Stonehaven.

18:52.496 --> 18:54.397
Oh, your life is going to change so much

18:54.399 --> 18:55.931
when you become a father.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.266
You have no idea.

18:57.268 --> 18:59.301
Are you ready for the responsibility?

18:59.303 --> 19:02.071
Well, I've got a few months.

19:05.241 --> 19:08.176
A large part of being a parent

19:08.178 --> 19:11.847
is to make the right
choices for your child.

19:11.849 --> 19:13.548
Be a strong man,

19:13.550 --> 19:16.184
a good role model in his life.

19:16.186 --> 19:18.553
But I promise you, the first time

19:18.555 --> 19:20.589
you look into that child's eyes,

19:20.591 --> 19:23.658
you are going to know that
you would do anything

19:23.660 --> 19:25.994
to keep them safe.

19:25.996 --> 19:27.662
That's what parents do.

19:31.634 --> 19:34.335
Over the centuries,

19:34.337 --> 19:37.672
we've learned that the only
way to keep our kind safe

19:37.674 --> 19:40.742
is within the Pack.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.209
That's it.

19:46.248 --> 19:48.516
I have some business
to attend to in town.

19:51.085 --> 19:53.654
We can continue this conversation later.

19:53.656 --> 19:55.289

It's an old house with old pipes.

21:43.763 --> 21:45.262
I grew up in an old house.

Jeremy didn't want me
to meet with Santos.

22:33.877 --> 22:35.811
So he locked you up?

22:35.813 --> 22:37.846
He didn't tell you?

22:37.848 --> 22:40.182
Jeremy's going to sacrifice
himself to Santos

22:40.184 --> 22:41.983
in exchange for Clay's life.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.953

going to kill them both.

22:44.955 --> 22:48.156
All right, now what?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.091
I don't think we're safe here.

22:51.527 --> 22:54.061
You and Rachel need to leave now.

22:57.566 --> 22:59.099
Take care of her.

23:03.739 --> 23:05.940
Daniel Santos might be
the scum of the earth,

23:05.942 --> 23:07.875
but if nothing else, he's punctual.

23:07.877 --> 23:09.777
There's something wrong.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.511
Maybe he clocked us and bolted.

just a ruse to lure us out.

23:14.516 --> 23:16.650

Hey, hey-hey-hey.

23:25.361 --> 23:27.494
You'll get yours, I promise.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.771
You came alone.

23:37.773 --> 23:40.707
That's the second smart
thing you've done.

23:40.709 --> 23:43.042
The first was warning me about
Jeremy and Nick at the diner.

23:43.044 --> 23:46.246
I'm not interested in small talk.

23:46.248 --> 23:48.514
Tell me what it'll take to release Clay.

23:53.509 --> 23:54.553
Where's Clay?

23:54.555 --> 23:56.088
I thought you were going to bring him.

23:56.098 --> 23:58.524
I wasn't going to risk
walking into a Pack ambush.

23:58.774 --> 24:00.367
I needed to ensure that you'd cooperate

24:00.369 --> 24:01.836
before I brought Clay out into the open.

24:01.838 --> 24:03.404
What have you done to him?

24:03.406 --> 24:05.872
Nothing that he hasn't deserved,

24:05.874 --> 24:07.208

24:20.154 --> 24:21.822
If you kill Clay, I swear,

24:21.824 --> 24:24.725
I will hunt you down and make
you wish you were never born.

24:24.727 --> 24:27.761
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

24:33.868 --> 24:35.368
Clay is alive.

24:35.370 --> 24:38.938
And what you do next determines
if he stays that way.

24:38.940 --> 24:40.440
Let's hear your proposition.

24:40.442 --> 24:43.409
The tide has turned against the Pack.

24:43.411 --> 24:45.578
We can attack at will,
as we've demonstrated,

24:45.580 --> 24:48.648
and pretty soon, there won't
be anybody left at Stonehaven

24:48.650 --> 24:50.583
to turn out the lights.

24:50.585 --> 24:51.884
Go on.

24:51.886 --> 24:54.520
You agree to join up with me

24:54.522 --> 24:56.321
and I'll free Clay.

24:56.323 --> 24:58.423
And I'll also let Jeremy

24:58.425 --> 25:00.425
and all the others live,

25:00.427 --> 25:02.728
as long as they agree to
stay on the move like Mutts.

25:02.730 --> 25:04.697
No permanent homes.

25:04.699 --> 25:06.732
- You're serious.
- Deadly.

25:06.734 --> 25:08.233
Oh, and here's the kicker:

25:08.235 --> 25:10.269
if you should ever, ever,

25:10.271 --> 25:12.137
decide to renege on the agreement,

25:12.139 --> 25:14.439
Clay, Jeremy, all of the others,

25:14.441 --> 25:18.009
will be hunted down and slaughtered.

25:18.011 --> 25:20.045
It's a win-win for you.

25:20.047 --> 25:22.314
The people that you love get to live.

25:24.317 --> 25:26.918
And you end up giving
birth to a new dynasty.

25:29.188 --> 25:31.756
Their well-being is in your hands now.

25:33.225 --> 25:35.326
What about everybody else in my life?

25:35.328 --> 25:36.661
You mean Philip?

25:36.663 --> 25:38.262
Well...

25:38.264 --> 25:40.464
Your friend Victor Olson's
gone to pay him a visit,

25:40.466 --> 25:41.799
to finish what he started.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.467
Call him off.

25:43.469 --> 25:45.670
Olson doesn't believe in cell phones.

25:45.672 --> 25:47.705
Hey! I am the only thing

25:47.707 --> 25:49.773
standing between the Pack and death.

25:51.776 --> 25:53.444
So, what'll it be?

26:00.819 --> 26:03.087
My offer's only good
till the end of the day.

26:04.589 --> 26:06.123
Man: I know you've been through a lot.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.391
I just need a minute of your time, okay?

26:08.393 --> 26:10.560
A couple questions, I'll
be out of your hair.

26:10.562 --> 26:13.230
Walk me through what happened.

26:13.232 --> 26:15.031
All I remember were a
couple of guys coming in.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.299
(Deadbolt clattering)

26:16.301 --> 26:18.435
Did you know or recognize them?

26:18.437 --> 26:19.802
No.

26:19.804 --> 26:21.338
They didn't say what they wanted?

26:21.340 --> 26:23.540
They jumped me as soon as they came in.

26:23.542 --> 26:25.074
I tried to put up a fight.

26:25.076 --> 26:27.677
I saw your place. You must
have put up a hell of a fight.

26:27.679 --> 26:29.379
(Grunts)

26:29.381 --> 26:32.749
You got any idea why anyone
would attack you in your home?

26:32.751 --> 26:34.250
I don't have any enemies

26:34.252 --> 26:36.919
if that's what you're getting at.

26:36.921 --> 26:39.088
If you remember anything,

26:39.090 --> 26:40.223
you call me.

26:49.699 --> 26:51.133
You should have told him

26:51.135 --> 26:53.034
about the stalker you
beat up at Elena's show.

26:53.036 --> 26:55.203
That stalker was one of the guys
that attacked me in my apartment.

26:55.205 --> 26:56.905
Why didn't you tell the police that?

26:56.907 --> 26:58.540
Because Elena and her family

26:58.542 --> 27:00.542
are involved in some
kind of a mafia war.

27:00.544 --> 27:01.943
How do you know this?

27:01.945 --> 27:03.746
Elena told me yesterday.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.914
We have got to keep this quiet.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.583
Do not tell Mom when she comes back.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.820
Why are you still protecting Elena?

27:11.822 --> 27:13.822
Especially if it means putting yourself,

27:13.824 --> 27:15.523
and maybe our family, in jeopardy?

27:15.525 --> 27:17.525
Look at me.

27:17.527 --> 27:19.861
Look at where I am.

27:19.863 --> 27:22.963
I'm not saying anything <i>because</i>
it's going to put us in jeopardy.

27:32.174 --> 27:34.676
You look as though you could use a drink.

27:36.812 --> 27:39.814
Sadly, I have nothing
stronger than bottled water.

27:45.253 --> 27:48.189
I wish I could help you more,

27:48.191 --> 27:50.324
but our friend Santos has relegated me

27:50.326 --> 27:52.860
to something above peon status.

27:52.862 --> 27:54.861
Where is he?

27:54.863 --> 27:56.697
He went to meet with Elena.

27:58.399 --> 27:59.666
(Laboured breathing)

27:59.668 --> 28:01.435
It seems your lovely lady

28:01.437 --> 28:04.137
has made quite the
impression on him of late.

28:07.908 --> 28:11.811
This entire affair has
gone horribly sideways

28:11.813 --> 28:13.947
and you should know that...

28:13.949 --> 28:18.051
I never intended for things
to get this far out of hand.

28:18.053 --> 28:20.753
You thought the Pack would
just roll over and play dead?

28:20.755 --> 28:23.522
No.

28:23.524 --> 28:25.691
Let's just say I made
the unfortunate decision

28:25.693 --> 28:27.360
to trade the devil I know in Jeremy

28:27.362 --> 28:29.829
with the devil I don't in Santos,

28:29.831 --> 28:31.530
who's gone from ambitious upstart

28:31.532 --> 28:34.233
to tyrannical despot
in the blink of an eye.

28:35.569 --> 28:37.870
You could always switch sides.

28:37.872 --> 28:40.673
I imagine that's the offer
you made to Zachary Cain,

28:40.675 --> 28:42.475
before you snapped his neck

28:42.477 --> 28:45.410
and buried him amidst the
sugar maples in Stonehaven.

28:47.713 --> 28:49.848

29:11.705 --> 29:13.371

- Got it.

29:29.721 --> 29:31.255
They're gone too.

29:31.257 --> 29:32.956
There's no sign of struggle,

29:32.958 --> 29:34.958
no scent of Mutt...

29:34.960 --> 29:36.827
Logan must have let her out.

29:38.730 --> 29:41.732
Wherever she is, I hope she
knows what she's doing.

30:05.456 --> 30:07.623

30:23.277 --> 30:25.411

30:25.413 --> 30:27.581
Then I see your face,

30:27.583 --> 30:30.383
your beautiful, beautiful face.

30:30.385 --> 30:31.650
Tell me!

30:31.652 --> 30:33.018
Or...?

30:33.020 --> 30:35.921
You'll live to regret it.

30:35.923 --> 30:37.823
I thought we were friends.

30:37.825 --> 30:40.759
We were never friends.

30:40.761 --> 30:42.861
Oh, Elena.

30:42.863 --> 30:46.165
Do you realize how long
we've known each other?

30:46.167 --> 30:48.333
Since you were...

30:48.335 --> 30:51.770
What, six? Seven?

30:51.772 --> 30:54.873
I've been in your life
longer than anyone else.

30:54.875 --> 30:57.910
And after all these years,
I'm still in your life.

30:57.912 --> 30:59.211
Where is he?

30:59.213 --> 31:01.213
If I tell you,

31:01.215 --> 31:03.115
what'll you give me in return?

31:05.718 --> 31:07.285
Your life.

31:09.088 --> 31:12.124
You're not a killer.

31:12.126 --> 31:14.493
You don't know what I am.

31:16.129 --> 31:18.062
Aaaah!

31:18.064 --> 31:19.864
Tell me.

31:19.866 --> 31:23.200
And it's important you call
me back when you get this.

31:23.202 --> 31:25.036
Any word from Logan or Elena?

31:25.038 --> 31:26.337
I've left them messages.

31:26.339 --> 31:28.072
What did your cousin Jorge say?

31:28.074 --> 31:30.842
The grapevine is buzzing that
the Mutts are reaching out,

31:30.844 --> 31:32.543
looking for new recruits.

31:32.545 --> 31:34.211
For what, exactly?

31:34.213 --> 31:36.080
My guess,

31:36.082 --> 31:38.215
an all-out assault.

31:38.217 --> 31:40.050
They know we're weak.

31:40.052 --> 31:42.453
Especially without Clay.

31:42.455 --> 31:44.622
But the more this situation
unfolds, the more I start to wonder

31:44.624 --> 31:46.390
who's really pulling the
strings of this uprising.

31:46.392 --> 31:48.459
You don't think it's Santos.

31:48.461 --> 31:50.827
I think he has the wherewithal

31:50.829 --> 31:52.996
to recruit Cain and Marsten,

31:52.998 --> 31:54.564
bite a couple of killers and pedophiles.

31:54.566 --> 31:57.333
But that's just one aspect of this.

31:57.335 --> 31:59.202
They're hitting Elena from all sides.

31:59.204 --> 32:00.904
Here, in Toronto.

32:00.906 --> 32:03.573
And then this video of Logan and
Elena running as wolves surfaces.

32:03.575 --> 32:05.575
That's not a coincidence.

32:05.577 --> 32:08.745
No, Clay said it came from
somebody named James Williams.

32:08.747 --> 32:10.880
We need to figure out
who James Williams is

32:10.882 --> 32:13.483
and why he's getting
involved in our business.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.221
Time is running out.

32:18.223 --> 32:21.090
For me, or for Clay?

32:23.494 --> 32:25.195
Aaaah!

32:25.197 --> 32:27.129
Tell me where he is and
I'll tie off your wounds

32:27.131 --> 32:30.199
and stop the bleeding.

32:30.201 --> 32:32.001
Such a pretty girl.

32:32.003 --> 32:33.803
Always.

32:33.805 --> 32:38.174
All I'd want is to brush
your hair one more time.

32:38.176 --> 32:39.675
Untie me.

32:39.677 --> 32:41.443
I will.

32:41.445 --> 32:44.680

32:44.682 --> 32:46.548
I tell you what I know,

32:46.550 --> 32:51.220

33:23.419 --> 33:26.053

- I didn't have my cell phone.

33:28.022 --> 33:29.823
- Your life is in danger.
- I believe you.

hornet's nest we've kicked.

42:50.961 --> 42:52.294
Clay's weak.

42:52.296 --> 42:55.096
We can still win this battle.

42:55.098 --> 42:57.232
The three of us?
(Cell phone ringing)

43:03.772 --> 43:05.574
Hello?

43:05.576 --> 43:07.709
James: I understand you
lost your trump card.

43:07.711 --> 43:09.911
Santos: (On phone) <i>- How did you know that?</i>
- It doesn't matter.

43:09.913 --> 43:12.513
There will be no more kidnappings,
no more negotiations,

43:12.515 --> 43:14.782
no more talking, period.

43:14.784 --> 43:17.518
It's time for action.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.187
What kind of action?

43:19.189 --> 43:21.555
It's time to storm the castle.
