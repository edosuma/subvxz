WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.109
(suspenseful music)

00:02.109 --> 00:04.180
(water splashes)

00:04.180 --> 00:06.567
- [Gordon] I'm in Florida
to help a struggling hotel

00:06.567 --> 00:08.020
one the beach.

00:08.020 --> 00:11.860
A young owner at the helm who
has no control over his staff.

00:11.860 --> 00:12.870
What is that?

00:12.870 --> 00:13.703
Oh, boy.

00:13.703 --> 00:16.200
- Why it's like that, I have no idea.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.134
- [Gordon] I'm faced with
many challenging situations.

00:19.134 --> 00:20.317
It stinks in here.

00:20.317 --> 00:21.740
The place is filthy.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.020
Really bad.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.750
And I'm unsure if I can
turn this place around.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.400
Your chef has shut down.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.900
I can't work like this.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.000
I wanna go now.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.873
I wanna get the fuck out of here.

00:36.390 --> 00:39.307
(slow piano music)

00:44.840 --> 00:47.140
Midway between Orlando and Miami,

00:47.140 --> 00:48.960
on Florida's Atlantic coast,

00:48.960 --> 00:51.280
lies the small town of Fort Pierce.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.433
Home to the Beachfront Inn and Inlet.

00:55.970 --> 00:59.530
Owner Brian Paul opened it in 2012

00:59.530 --> 01:02.300
after running his family's
successful local fish market

01:02.300 --> 01:03.240
with his brother.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.050
- My job before the Inlet
was the CEO, the head

01:06.050 --> 01:08.300
of my dad's fish market.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.280
My dad ran a business like a real leader.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.493
He had so many friends.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.740
Pillar of the community.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.530
Everybody loved him, and
I always knew as a child

01:18.530 --> 01:20.823
I wanted to have my own place.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.640
(water splashing)

01:26.640 --> 01:28.140
- [Liza] I think Brian
has a lot of schooling

01:28.140 --> 01:28.980
under his belt.

01:28.980 --> 01:33.200
I'm not exactly sure that
he has any hotel experience.

01:33.200 --> 01:38.200
- Brian as an owner is
physically here sometimes.

01:38.810 --> 01:40.853
He just, like, kind of wanders around.

01:42.330 --> 01:44.270
- Brian is a little too easygoing.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.640
If it was me, I'd have my
hands, nose, eyes, and ears

01:47.640 --> 01:52.343
in everything, and I
don't see him doing that.

01:56.930 --> 01:58.410
- [Liza] Brian definitely
has a lot of friends

01:58.410 --> 01:59.560
that work here,

01:59.560 --> 02:03.280
some of which have taken
advantage of him in the past.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.980
I believe that Chef Ben probably has taken

02:06.980 --> 02:08.280
the most advantage of him.

02:10.020 --> 02:11.238
- I want a beer.

02:11.238 --> 02:12.380
- [Staff Member] Ooh, yeah.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.399
- [Ben] Ooh, we're having
a tasty beer tonight, boys.

02:14.399 --> 02:15.820
- [Staff Member] Yeah!

02:15.820 --> 02:17.850
- Ben is an awesome guy.

02:17.850 --> 02:20.170
I've known him forever,
we've been friends forever.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.330
I give him plenty of space.

02:22.330 --> 02:23.940
I help him, whatever he needs,

02:23.940 --> 02:26.200
but I don't muddle in
his affairs down there.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.070
- I think that the issue here
has been a lack of consistency

02:30.070 --> 02:31.350
with our food, and I mean,

02:31.350 --> 02:33.487
that directly has to be
attributed to the executive chef.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.333
You know, his name is Ben.

02:36.820 --> 02:38.670
- [Ben] I feel like the
Inlet and the Beachfront,

02:38.670 --> 02:40.000
both lack direction.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.770
We're trying to be too
many things at once,

02:41.770 --> 02:45.370
a nightclub, a bar, a restaurant,
a hotel, a wedding venue,

02:45.370 --> 02:48.320
a concert venue, a place to
do your Christmas party at.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.467
I mean, aargh.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.540
- [Joey] No military
secret, we have some guests

02:53.540 --> 02:55.740
and employees hooting and hollering

02:55.740 --> 02:58.440
till the wee hours of the morning,

02:58.440 --> 02:59.310
and that's out of control.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.270
That's got to stop.

03:00.270 --> 03:02.020
It's bad for business.

03:02.020 --> 03:04.510
Brian has to refund hotel guests' money

03:04.510 --> 03:06.093
'cause of the noise complaints.

03:08.690 --> 03:11.030
- [Liza] I think this place
has so much potential,

03:11.030 --> 03:12.200
so much to offer.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.660
We don't wanna see it fail.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.420
We don't wanna see Brian fail.

03:15.420 --> 03:18.400
He definitely needs to
step up and help us all out

03:18.400 --> 03:19.660
to help him.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.140
He needs to grab those reins

03:21.140 --> 03:24.940
and start seeing the
damage that's happening

03:24.940 --> 03:26.473
and start fixing it.

03:30.016 --> 03:33.516
(bright orchestral music)

03:36.510 --> 03:38.280
- Today I'm in the beautiful coastal town

03:38.280 --> 03:39.820
of Fort Pierce, Florida.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.460
Just looking around, you're
surrounded by stunning beaches.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.260
Marina's full of deep sea fishing boats.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.343
This place is gorgeous.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.340
Look at this place.

03:52.340 --> 03:54.290
It looks like the hotel is closed down.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.090
Hello, anybody in?

03:57.090 --> 03:58.200
- [Liza] Welcome.
- [Gordon] Thank you.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.250
- How are you?

03:59.250 --> 04:01.260
- I'm very well indeed,
thank you, first name is?

04:01.260 --> 04:03.100
- Liza, good to meet you.
- Liza, good to see you.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.210
- How are you doing today?

04:04.210 --> 04:05.320
- [Gordon] Whose is this?

04:05.320 --> 04:06.153
- [Liza] The boss man caught it.

04:06.153 --> 04:08.130
- [Gordon] And where's
the other half gone?

04:08.130 --> 04:08.963
- Maybe they ate it, I don't know.

04:08.963 --> 04:10.900
- Belt, a pair of shoes...

04:10.900 --> 04:11.733
- [Liza] Couldn't tell you,

04:11.733 --> 04:12.810
it is a little weird.
- What do you use it for?

04:12.810 --> 04:14.600
- I don't use it for anything, actually.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.903
- Wow, and what's that up there?

04:15.903 --> 04:18.640
- That was here when I got
here, believe it or not.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.910
- That's for sale?

04:19.910 --> 04:20.829
- Apparently so, yes.

04:20.829 --> 04:23.740
- So he went onto the beach,
picked up some driftwood,

04:23.740 --> 04:25.500
and then dipped it in some varnish?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.333
- Yup.

04:27.317 --> 04:28.720
- $22.
- [Liza] Mm-hmm.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.650
- Stop.
- Same as that one over there.

04:30.650 --> 04:31.507
- No.

04:31.507 --> 04:32.520
(Liza laughs)

04:32.520 --> 04:34.720
- Insane, no?
(Liza laughs)

04:34.720 --> 04:36.150
- Have you sold any of these?
- No.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.610
- Never?
- [Liza] Never.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.443
- [Gordon] Seriously?

04:38.443 --> 04:39.810
And how much for the T-shirts?

04:39.810 --> 04:43.210
- Between $12 for employees
and $18 for guests.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.800
- So staff have to pay
for their own T-shirts?

04:44.800 --> 04:45.633
- [Liza] Yes.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.820
- And for the guests they're $18?

04:46.820 --> 04:47.653
- Yes.

04:47.653 --> 04:48.670
- [Gordon] Wow, so when was the last time

04:48.670 --> 04:49.820
you sold a T-shirt?

04:49.820 --> 04:52.340
- I sell them every day,
but mostly to the employees.

04:52.340 --> 04:54.020
- The employees.
- Yes.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.320
- [Gordon] How long have you been here?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.440
- The establishment's been
here almost three years.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.937
I've been here almost three years as well.

04:58.937 --> 05:00.860
- Wow, what's wrong with
it, from your point of view?

05:00.860 --> 05:03.090
- Noise levels, especially the one

05:03.090 --> 05:04.500
directly above the restaurant

05:04.500 --> 05:05.960
that you probably don't want to hear.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.793
- What kind of noise?

05:06.793 --> 05:07.870
'Cause it's not the...

05:07.870 --> 05:10.190
- The music and the
people, the foot traffic,

05:10.190 --> 05:12.590
everybody hanging out at the
bar and things of that nature.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.840
- So that goes on directly underneath?

05:14.840 --> 05:15.850
- Yes.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.270
They end up being refunded,

05:17.270 --> 05:19.530
and then they end up putting us on blast

05:19.530 --> 05:22.260
on all of these websites and social media

05:22.260 --> 05:24.930
and just bad reviews left and right.

05:24.930 --> 05:27.336
Housekeeping, come back.

05:27.336 --> 05:28.169
- What's that for?

05:28.169 --> 05:30.060
- To touch base with the housekeepers.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.820
- Wow, can I have a quick word?

05:31.820 --> 05:32.880
Just out of interest--

05:32.880 --> 05:34.330
It's Gordon here, I've just checked in,

05:34.330 --> 05:36.130
how far away are the fucking rooms?

05:36.130 --> 05:38.523
I mean, you sound like you're miles away.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.070
Hello, madam?
(Liza laughs)

05:43.070 --> 05:44.040
- [Liza] You scared her.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.188
- [Gordon] So room 16?
- [Liza] Yes, sir.

05:46.188 --> 05:47.350
- And where is it please, darling?

05:47.350 --> 05:48.270
- [Liza] I'm gonna direct you.

05:48.270 --> 05:49.103
Right this way.

05:49.950 --> 05:50.783
- [Gordon] What's that thing there?

05:50.783 --> 05:52.740
- [Liza] We grill our wings on it.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.750
- You grill your wings on it?

05:53.750 --> 05:54.583
- [Liza] Yes.

05:54.583 --> 05:55.770
- How often do you grill wings in there?

05:55.770 --> 05:57.930
- [Liza] Every stinking day.

05:57.930 --> 05:59.630
- [Gordon] Wow, Jesus.

05:59.630 --> 06:01.930
In fact, I think there's
a wing left in there.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.480
When was that grilled?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.040
- Chances are, it could've been yesterday.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.853
Those are the extra crispy ones.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.810
- [Gordon] And who's responsible for this?

06:11.810 --> 06:15.160
- The kitchen handles all of
this end of it, of course.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.770
You found another char-broiled?

06:16.770 --> 06:17.870
- [Gordon] And these were done yesterday?

06:17.870 --> 06:18.777
- [Liza] I believe so.

06:18.777 --> 06:20.300
- And they cook everyday on here?

06:20.300 --> 06:21.133
- [Liza] Yes.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.891
- [Gordon] And are the
customers still alive?

06:22.891 --> 06:23.724
(Liza laughs)

06:23.724 --> 06:25.470
- Fucking hell.

06:25.470 --> 06:26.303
Right, room 16.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.600
Let's go.
- [Liza] Yes, sir.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.100
This is your Caribbean building.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.560
- The Caribbean?

06:30.560 --> 06:31.940
- Caribbean, Caribbean, yes.

06:31.940 --> 06:35.410
- And what part of this
resembles the Caribbean?

06:35.410 --> 06:37.800
- [Liza] I think it's more
so because of the view.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.830
- [Gordon] Oh, the view.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.190
- [Liza] You're right here, sir.

06:40.190 --> 06:41.023
- [Gordon] Thank you very much.

06:41.023 --> 06:41.860
- You're very welcome.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.237
Enjoy.
- [Gordon] Thank you.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.410
- [Liza] Thank you.

06:44.410 --> 06:45.243
- Wow (sniffs).

06:49.352 --> 06:50.890
Look at this.

06:50.890 --> 06:51.723
Wow.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.580
It stinks in here.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.660
There's a very sort of damp, musty smell.

06:58.660 --> 06:59.493
Bloody hell.

07:00.832 --> 07:04.193
Oh, the bed feels like it's 15 years old.

07:05.099 --> 07:06.630
Oh, it smells.

07:06.630 --> 07:07.960
Curtains are terrible.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.332
Ugh.

07:09.332 --> 07:10.433
The place is filthy.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.403
Really bad.

07:13.448 --> 07:14.798
That's a little disgusting.

07:16.197 --> 07:19.891
$180 a night for this shit hole.

07:19.891 --> 07:20.724
Ugh.

07:21.690 --> 07:26.690
Wow, minibar consisting
of absolutely fuck all.

07:27.300 --> 07:32.220
Freezer over frozen and
defrosted about 10 years ago.

07:32.220 --> 07:33.253
What a mess.

07:34.136 --> 07:36.553
(calm music)

07:38.490 --> 07:40.510
I know when I'm coming to fix a business

07:40.510 --> 07:42.580
they have various issues.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.810
But right now, with
the information I have,

07:44.810 --> 07:47.750
I am not impressed with
how Brian, as an owner,

07:47.750 --> 07:49.163
is operating this hotel.

07:50.080 --> 07:50.913
Hello.

07:50.913 --> 07:52.020
- Hello, welcome to the Inlet.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.130
- So you must be Brian.

07:53.130 --> 07:53.990
- I am, sir.

07:53.990 --> 07:57.250
- The hotelier and the 34-year-old.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.450
- I do it all.
- [Gordon] You do it all.

07:59.450 --> 08:01.340
Is that what you are, seriously, 34?

08:01.340 --> 08:02.173
- Right.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.283
You know what?

08:04.283 --> 08:05.203
I'm 33.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.970
I work so hard, I think
I just thought I was 34.

08:08.970 --> 08:10.358
- You're 33.

08:10.358 --> 08:11.293
Fuck me.

08:12.347 --> 08:14.610
Did you call this building the Caribbean?

08:14.610 --> 08:15.443
- [Brian] Yes.

08:15.443 --> 08:16.530
- [Gordon] Have you ever
been to the Caribbean?

08:16.530 --> 08:18.200
- [Brian] Yeah.
- Which part?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.033
- [Brian] Bahamas.

08:19.033 --> 08:22.080
- [Gordon] And this has been
modelled on the Bahamas?

08:22.080 --> 08:23.056
- [Brian] Correct.

08:23.056 --> 08:24.540
- Do you smoke when you're in the Bahamas?

08:24.540 --> 08:25.560
You know that...

08:25.560 --> 08:26.900
- I've tried a couple times, surely.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.330
- [Gordon] Okay, stop.

08:28.330 --> 08:29.850
- [Brian] Yeah (laughs).

08:29.850 --> 08:32.270
- What hotel in the
Caribbean or the Bahamas

08:32.270 --> 08:33.520
were you running before
you bought this one?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.600
- So I've just visited the Caribbean.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.840
I've never ran a hotel in the Caribbean.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.169
- So you just go buy
yourself a 25-bedroom hotel

08:40.169 --> 08:41.650
on the beach with a bar and--

08:41.650 --> 08:43.289
- All I knew how to do
was run a fish market

08:43.289 --> 08:44.611
when I opened this--
- Fish market?

08:44.611 --> 08:46.120
- and I built it from the
scratch, from the ground up.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.930
- So the fish, it's fresh?

08:47.930 --> 08:49.940
Obviously from the market.
- [Brian] They're so fresh.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.620
- [Gordon] Right, I'd better jump in.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.650
- Can I show you to your table?

08:52.650 --> 08:53.483
- Yes, why not?

08:53.483 --> 08:54.316
Yeah.

08:57.690 --> 08:58.750
- [Brian] Table for you right here.

08:58.750 --> 08:59.583
- Excellent, thank you.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.640
- May I?
- Please.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.190
I'm excited for the fresh fish.

09:04.138 --> 09:05.170
- [Joey] It's so surreal, bro.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.970
Gordon Ramsay's in the dining room.

09:06.970 --> 09:07.803
- What's with the name tags?

09:07.803 --> 09:09.160
I mean, you're the owner, right?

09:09.160 --> 09:12.210
- I think I should lead by
example, so I like to wear mine.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.100
That way if I tell them
they need to wear them,

09:14.100 --> 09:16.080
then they can't say, "Well,
Brian, you don't wear yours."

09:16.080 --> 09:17.730
- Right, I'm starving, I am starving.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.420
- I'm gonna get you some food right away.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.810
I'm gonna get you a great server.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.643
- Okay, great.

09:24.980 --> 09:25.813
How are you?
- How you doing?

09:25.813 --> 09:27.041
Good.
- Nice to see you, likewise.

09:27.041 --> 09:27.874
- My name's Kelly.

09:27.874 --> 09:28.707
- Kelly, how long you been here?

09:28.707 --> 09:29.840
- I've been here about a year.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.720
- Nice, and why do the staff
have to buy their T-shirts?

09:33.720 --> 09:34.553
- I don't--

09:34.553 --> 09:35.386
I was never told.

09:35.386 --> 09:36.720
Even our first shirts, our name tags.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.960
- You buy your name tag as well?

09:37.960 --> 09:39.220
- Yeah.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.074
We have to pay, like, $8.

09:41.074 --> 09:42.817
Never seen that before?

09:42.817 --> 09:44.610
- $8 a name tag, $12 a T-shirt,

09:44.610 --> 09:46.560
That's $20 before you can fucking work.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.600
Wow.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.480
As I look at their menu, I
notice it's absolutely massive,

09:53.480 --> 09:56.040
so I decided to order the chicken wings

09:56.040 --> 09:59.690
which honestly I wasn't
surprised when they were dry.

09:59.690 --> 10:01.900
Then I had the lobster mac and cheese,

10:01.900 --> 10:03.700
which technically isn't mac and cheese,

10:03.700 --> 10:05.920
because they use penne pasta,

10:05.920 --> 10:09.000
but the worst part of my
lunch was the tuna burger

10:09.000 --> 10:11.180
which I knew wasn't quite right.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.640
Is that fresh?
- [Kelly] It is frozen.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.460
Oh, it's frozen?
- [Kelly] Yes.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.453
- Hold on, you said fish
market, fresh fish daily.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.611
Frozen fish, fresh fish.

10:20.611 --> 10:21.490
What's going on?

10:21.490 --> 10:23.180
- We use frozen sometimes, sure.

10:23.180 --> 10:26.113
- And you have a fish
market that you buy from?

10:27.720 --> 10:29.303
- Yeah, yep, yeah.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.690
- [Gordon] I'm confused.

10:32.690 --> 10:34.420
- [Brian] Ever since
about four months ago,

10:34.420 --> 10:35.890
everything was fresh, everything.

10:35.890 --> 10:38.220
I ran up a little bit of
a bill with my brother,

10:38.220 --> 10:40.350
so we cut back, and started ordering

10:40.350 --> 10:42.950
some of the frozen stuff
from some of the purveyors.

10:42.950 --> 10:44.520
- And what's the feedback?

10:44.520 --> 10:46.120
- We get some negative feedback.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.587
- [Ben] He hasn't had
one nice thing to say.

10:50.587 --> 10:52.730
- [Joey] I know it's a blow to the ego,

10:52.730 --> 10:55.264
but you knew it was gonna be something.

10:55.264 --> 10:56.323
- I didn't think it was
gonna be everything.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.600
- Explain this monstrosity.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.300
What in the fuck is going on here?

11:01.530 --> 11:03.250
- This is our kiosk.
- [Gordon] Kiosk?

11:03.250 --> 11:04.290
- [Brian] An effort to have products

11:04.290 --> 11:05.510
for all sorts of people.
- Right.

11:05.510 --> 11:06.861
So beach towels.
- Volleyballs.

11:06.861 --> 11:08.320
- Volleyballs.
- Beanbags.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.963
- T-shirts, sick bags.

11:10.940 --> 11:12.410
How busy is this?

11:12.410 --> 11:14.150
How well's it going?

11:14.150 --> 11:16.730
- Honestly, it doesn't do that good.

11:16.730 --> 11:18.430
- How many beach towels have you sold?

11:18.430 --> 11:19.330
- Not too many beach towels.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.860
- All right, show me one.

11:20.860 --> 11:21.850
- All right, I'll be right back.

11:21.850 --> 11:23.253
- [Gordon] I'd love to see one, please.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.673
What a fucking disaster.

11:34.590 --> 11:35.793
- [Brian] We're on the beach,
and we don't have towels.

11:35.793 --> 11:37.370
What is wrong with this picture?

11:37.370 --> 11:39.210
- How was lunch?
- [Diner] It was okay.

11:39.210 --> 11:40.170
- Okay?

11:40.170 --> 11:41.320
Okay's not good enough.

11:45.390 --> 11:46.547
Thought we'd lost you.

11:46.547 --> 11:47.800
Thank you very much.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.520
- Whenever you're ready
to go to the beach.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.200
- Whenever I'm ready to go to the beach.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.133
Wow, how many do you have in stock?

11:54.060 --> 11:54.893
- One.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.140
You got it.

11:57.140 --> 11:58.140
That's the one.

11:58.140 --> 11:59.770
- Okay, can you charge
that to my room, please?

11:59.770 --> 12:00.603
- [Brian] Yes, I will.

12:00.603 --> 12:01.890
- So we're sold out now?

12:01.890 --> 12:03.340
- Yes.
- [Gordon] Yeah.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.790
Wow.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.105
Jeez.

12:06.105 --> 12:09.280
(bright music)

12:09.280 --> 12:11.000
At lunch, I was very disappointed

12:11.000 --> 12:14.460
that Brian falsely advertises
fresh fish on his menu.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.340
I want to learn more about
how involved he is as an owner

12:17.340 --> 12:19.290
during an evening at the Beachfront.

12:19.290 --> 12:21.140
- Checking in, Susan Addison.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.640
- Can I go ahead and start you
off with something to drink?

12:23.640 --> 12:24.473
- Okay.

12:26.550 --> 12:28.433
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

12:28.433 --> 12:30.340
- Okay, Ben.
- [Ben] Hey, Chef.

12:30.340 --> 12:31.570
- Just give us a little, quick run-through

12:31.570 --> 12:32.980
how the line works.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.777
- Well, normally I run the pass and expo.

12:34.777 --> 12:35.610
- [Gordon] Right.

12:35.610 --> 12:36.443
- Chef, I take care of this.

12:36.443 --> 12:38.170
Boom, boom, boom.

12:38.170 --> 12:41.030
He usually passes to the saute
guy and then the fry guy.

12:41.030 --> 12:45.750
Working with Ben, I can't
really tell you what he does.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.150
- Where's Brian?
- Don't know, Chef.

12:48.150 --> 12:50.070
And Brian will just avoid him,

12:50.070 --> 12:52.910
instead of trying to get
to the root of the problem,

12:52.910 --> 12:55.553
and I think that in itself is a problem.

12:56.890 --> 12:58.280
- How long have you been here?

12:58.280 --> 12:59.500
- Since last December.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.770
- Oh, wow, so you've
been here a long time?

13:00.770 --> 13:01.603
- [Server] Yeah.

13:01.603 --> 13:03.210
- In your mind, what do you
think the major problems are?

13:03.210 --> 13:05.490
- Lack of consistency,
as a matter of fact,

13:05.490 --> 13:06.780
and lack of structure.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.460
- Yeah, I saw that lunchtime.
- [Server] Yeah.

13:08.460 --> 13:11.970
I found out about the fish
not being so fresh, so--

13:11.970 --> 13:14.010
- How can you not sell fresh
fish when you're on the beach?

13:14.010 --> 13:16.230
- That's our motto, "fresh fish."

13:16.230 --> 13:17.553
- [Gordon] So how many of
them do you think understand

13:17.553 --> 13:19.420
that we're selling frozen fish?

13:19.420 --> 13:21.240
- They probably don't.
- No?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.930
- [Server] 'Cause I
don't think the servers

13:22.930 --> 13:24.050
are telling them.
- [Gordon] No.

13:24.050 --> 13:25.720
Meanwhile the customers disappear.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.565
- Yeah.

13:26.565 --> 13:27.802
- Thank you, great update.
- Yeah, thank you.

13:27.802 --> 13:29.280
- Thank you.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.680
Brian, how many of these
customers in tonight

13:31.680 --> 13:33.360
know that you're selling frozen food?

13:33.360 --> 13:36.040
- You know, they don't really
know how the market works,

13:36.040 --> 13:36.873
so probably none of them.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.832
- They don't know how the market works?

13:38.832 --> 13:39.750
- They don't understand that.

13:39.750 --> 13:40.899
- Sorry, how are you?

13:40.899 --> 13:41.745
- [Diner] Good, how are you?

13:41.745 --> 13:42.578
- [Gordon] Do you think
we're gonna be serving

13:42.578 --> 13:44.269
frozen food tonight or fresh fish?

13:44.269 --> 13:45.102
- Fresh.
- Fresh.

13:45.102 --> 13:46.437
- [Gordon] Fresh, why fresh?

13:46.437 --> 13:48.520
- Well, we're on the beach and--

13:48.520 --> 13:49.703
- Well, why don't you
explain to them tonight

13:49.703 --> 13:51.600
that you changed things four months ago,

13:51.600 --> 13:53.510
and we're not serving fresh fish anymore,

13:53.510 --> 13:54.560
we're serving frozen.

13:55.510 --> 13:56.343
Man up.

13:56.343 --> 13:57.610
- So, just a few months ago,

13:57.610 --> 13:59.480
we switched from some
of our fresh products

13:59.480 --> 14:01.176
to some frozen seafood products.

14:01.176 --> 14:02.410
- Why would you do that?

14:02.410 --> 14:03.390
- They're quality products.

14:03.390 --> 14:05.200
They just aren't the best of quality

14:05.200 --> 14:07.600
that you would expect from
the Pelican Seafood Market.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.720
- They're quality frozen products.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.320
- Yeah, it's a cost thing, so--

14:11.320 --> 14:13.250
- When I come out to somewhere like this,

14:13.250 --> 14:14.480
where being on the beach-

14:14.480 --> 14:15.313
- [Gordon] Of course.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.080
- I would hope to have fresh fish.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.640
- Where is this fucking freezer?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.920
Is it round here where
you keep the frozen?

14:20.920 --> 14:21.950
- [Brian] Right down here, Gordon.

14:21.950 --> 14:23.023
- [Gordon] Let's have a look.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.693
So this is the frozen bit here.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.673
What's that?

14:28.860 --> 14:30.935
Frozen avocado.

14:30.935 --> 14:33.223
Are we not in Florida?

14:36.284 --> 14:37.993
And you can't make fresh avocado?

14:40.740 --> 14:42.530
- Dude, this is fucked.

14:42.530 --> 14:44.030
- [Gordon] Where's the freezer?

14:44.030 --> 14:47.730
Excuse me.
- [Brian] Main walk-in.

14:47.730 --> 14:48.563
- [Gordon] Wow, wow, wow.

14:48.563 --> 14:50.520
When was the last time you were in here?

14:50.520 --> 14:53.080
- I come in here once a week at least,

14:53.080 --> 14:54.617
and I kind of, you know...
- [Gordon] Once a week?

14:54.617 --> 14:56.700
- Just kind of look around or whatever.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.460
- [Gordon] What is this?

14:58.460 --> 14:59.970
Wow.

14:59.970 --> 15:00.873
Oh, man.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.260
Look at them.

15:03.260 --> 15:04.743
The water's gone slimy.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.310
And you come in here once a week?

15:07.310 --> 15:08.570
- Yeah.

15:08.570 --> 15:09.820
- What is that?

15:11.681 --> 15:12.514
Oh, boy.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.143
Fucking hell, what is that?

15:18.380 --> 15:22.330
- Pina colada.
- Pina colada?

15:22.330 --> 15:24.300
- Why it's like that, I have no idea.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.800
- [Gordon] It's festered,
it's off, it's bubbling.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.730
Oh, man.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.000
- That's terrible.
- Fuck.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.753
- Trash, please, trash.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.470
James, trash please, now.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.220
- Pina colada.
- Right down the drain.

15:40.220 --> 15:43.223
- [Gordon] By the bucket
load in the walk-in fridge.

15:46.950 --> 15:50.340
I mean, who in the hell
operates like this?

15:50.340 --> 15:52.300
- Gordon, this is Chef Ben's job.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.470
He's the executive chef.

15:53.470 --> 15:54.800
- [Gordon] The executive chef.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.680
And you've made him that
executive chef, right?

15:56.680 --> 15:57.877
- Sure I did.

15:57.877 --> 15:59.427
- [Gordon] How do you feel now?

16:01.250 --> 16:02.650
What's that?
- [Brian] Tuna burger.

16:02.650 --> 16:03.860
- [Gordon] That's from the burger?

16:03.860 --> 16:04.693
- [Brian] Yes, it is.

16:04.693 --> 16:06.850
- [Gordon] Oh, my God, seriously?

16:06.850 --> 16:07.683
- [Brian] Bacon.

16:07.683 --> 16:09.350
- [Gordon] It's gone, and it's off.

16:09.350 --> 16:12.230
Fresh produce on top
of old produce, mouldy.

16:12.230 --> 16:13.260
And this one?

16:13.260 --> 16:14.093
- [Brian] Rib eye.

16:14.093 --> 16:15.820
- [Gordon] Rib eye defrosting.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.060
What is this?

16:17.060 --> 16:18.660
- [Brian] Those are the
smoked grilled chicken wings

16:18.660 --> 16:20.830
before they go onto the char grill.

16:20.830 --> 16:23.533
- [Gordon] Oh, my God,
and what is in this one?

16:24.700 --> 16:25.823
You are kidding me.

16:26.770 --> 16:29.370
So underneath in that bucket's what?

16:29.370 --> 16:31.940
- [Brian] Cooked product.
- [Gordon] Cooked chicken.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.860
And on top of it is what?
- It's raw.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.470
- Raw chicken on top of cooked chicken.

16:37.470 --> 16:38.763
I had them for lunch.

16:39.660 --> 16:42.200
I am at a fucking loss.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.830
Do you know the best way out of this

16:43.830 --> 16:45.380
is just to shut the place down.

16:46.725 --> 16:48.173
- That's not an option for me.

16:49.890 --> 16:50.980
- What's that in there, Ben?

16:50.980 --> 16:52.260
- Those are marinated chicken wings.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.540
- [Gordon] Yeah.
- [Ben] To be smoked.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.223
- [Gordon] Underneath, next box.

16:56.270 --> 16:58.060
- [Ben] Those are smoked.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.940
- Rule number fucking one, Ben.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.663
- I know, Chef, I didn't do it.

17:04.753 --> 17:05.849
You know, I turn my back for a minute,

17:05.849 --> 17:07.310
and this is the kind of shit that happens.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.492
- I walked in, and it was bedlam.

17:11.118 --> 17:12.240
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.740
- He's telling me this is your fault.

17:13.740 --> 17:14.780
You've got no idea.

17:14.780 --> 17:17.323
I am at an absolute fucking loss.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.369
I can't work like this.

17:20.369 --> 17:22.550
This is huge.

17:22.550 --> 17:27.223
You now are running a
restaurant cross-contaminated.

17:30.914 --> 17:33.914
(suspenseful music)

17:35.040 --> 17:36.340
Joey?
- [Joey] Yes, Chef?

17:36.340 --> 17:37.790
- Who's responsible for this?

17:38.920 --> 17:41.290
- We all are, the entire kitchen is, Chef.

17:41.290 --> 17:42.710
- Rule number one,

17:42.710 --> 17:45.050
you can't put hot food
in a fucking walk-in.

17:45.050 --> 17:46.730
It doesn't even go together.

17:46.730 --> 17:47.610
- No, not at all.

17:47.610 --> 17:48.980
Nowhere near each other.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.670
- I guarantee you when
it was put in there,

17:50.670 --> 17:53.490
after I marinated, that
they weren't shuffled.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.960
- I can give you 12 more
issues in there that are bad.

17:55.960 --> 18:00.413
I mean, you are heading for
a fucking massive disaster.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.810
- I mean, who the hell put
them on top of the other ones?

18:04.810 --> 18:05.643
Everybody in here knows better.

18:05.643 --> 18:06.476
- Brian, if I knew--

18:06.476 --> 18:07.526
- [Brian] Haven't you trained
everybody to know that?

18:07.526 --> 18:08.827
- Yeah.
- I mean...

18:08.827 --> 18:11.420
- [Gordon] All I'm getting
right now is excuses.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.590
The kitchen needs direction from the chef.

18:13.590 --> 18:16.970
The staff need direction from
the owner, and you're buddies.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.170
Can someone come up
with a fucking solution?

18:20.940 --> 18:22.530
- I'm gonna go and 86 the wings.

18:22.530 --> 18:26.163
- Sort it out quickly.
- Come on, guys.

18:27.110 --> 18:28.580
- [James] 86 wings.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.980
- [Ben] Someone put raw
fucking chicken wings

18:29.980 --> 18:31.110
on top of the cooked ones.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.820
It wasn't me, somebody else did it.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.620
86 wings is the only
thing I can do right now.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.570
- [Gordon] What in the fuck is going on?

18:37.570 --> 18:39.090
- [James] I was baffled and amazed.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.417
The words out of Ben's mouth were,

18:40.417 --> 18:42.717
"Oh, I clean that cooler
regularly every day."

18:45.150 --> 18:45.983
You want me to go in there,

18:45.983 --> 18:46.816
and pull everything out, and clean it?

18:46.816 --> 18:50.320
- That is not your job to wipe
the ass of an executive chef.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.110
- I know that, there were
weeks he wouldn't show up

18:53.110 --> 18:54.510
but maybe three days a week.

18:55.570 --> 18:56.950
- [Gordon] Well, why didn't Brian step up?

18:56.950 --> 18:59.850
- [James] Brian, he may be
oblivious to some of this stuff.

18:59.850 --> 19:02.860
They've known each other
since they were young guys.

19:02.860 --> 19:04.640
- This is crazy, so Ben goes AWOL,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.490
Brian does nothing about it,
the place starts falling apart,

19:07.490 --> 19:09.110
and then he just steps
back in when he wants.

19:09.110 --> 19:10.870
- Pretty much, pretty much, yeah.

19:10.870 --> 19:12.570
- But if this was your business,
you wouldn't tolerate that.

19:12.570 --> 19:14.073
- No, I would have fired
Ben a long time ago.

19:14.073 --> 19:16.820
I was all for firing Ben
two months ago, so I mean...

19:19.240 --> 19:22.330
- [Brian] No excuse for that
walk-in like that, so...

19:22.330 --> 19:24.160
- I'm sorry, I just
couldn't hold back anymore.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.680
He doesn't come to work.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.290
That's the reason why it
looks like that, okay?

19:27.290 --> 19:29.700
That's absolutely the reason why.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.600
If he's here by 12:00, and he
leaves by 5:00, we're lucky.

19:33.882 --> 19:34.715
I'm not gonna lie.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.773
- James is telling me the truth.

19:36.773 --> 19:38.329
- I'm here to tell you the truth as well.

19:38.329 --> 19:39.162
- You're not telling me the truth.

19:39.162 --> 19:40.220
- I promise you I'm
gonna tell you the truth.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.740
- [Gordon] The only way to
really, truly identify a chef,

19:43.740 --> 19:47.000
before you even taste his
food, is open up his walk-in.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.930
That speaks volumes for any chef.

19:49.930 --> 19:53.310
He's a chef that's given up
and going through the motions.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.010
- Sometimes I feel that way.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.030
We've been through a lot.

19:56.030 --> 19:57.390
I know he's got a lot on his plate.

19:57.390 --> 19:58.247
- [Gordon] He's incompetent,

19:58.247 --> 20:00.793
and he's taking your
fucking business down.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.193
- You know, I don't
think he's incompetent.

20:05.750 --> 20:09.180
- You're fucking mad, and the sad thing is

20:09.180 --> 20:12.140
that your staff, and your
management, and your team see it.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.650
And you're the only person

20:14.650 --> 20:16.953
that doesn't know what's going on.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.030
And this is the way you
wanna run your business?

20:21.030 --> 20:22.720
- Yeah.
- [Gordon] Ugh.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.203
You do not need my help.

20:34.430 --> 20:36.053
- [Announcer] What's up, party people?

20:36.891 --> 20:39.474
(upbeat music)

20:46.450 --> 20:49.550
- [Gordon] Wow, that's loud, that music.

20:49.550 --> 20:51.080
- [Liza] It is loud.
- [Gordon] Oh, man.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.090
- [Liza] How are you doing?

20:52.090 --> 20:53.640
- [Gordon] Yeah, I just need
a little piece and quiet.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.880
- Oh, not a problem.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.000
- [Gordon] That's crazy, no?

20:57.000 --> 20:57.888
- [Liza] Yes it is.

20:57.888 --> 20:59.610
- I mean, it's like the blind
leading the blind in there,

20:59.610 --> 21:01.840
because there's no discipline.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.720
- [Liza] That I do know.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.370
- Ben's checked out,
Brian's never checked in,

21:05.370 --> 21:07.780
and they're all blaming each other.

21:07.780 --> 21:10.210
- Yeah, I do know there's no discipline,

21:10.210 --> 21:11.520
there's no communication.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.353
There's none of it.
- [Gordon] No, no.

21:12.353 --> 21:14.380
What's the problem with him stepping up

21:14.380 --> 21:16.420
and dealing with issues?

21:16.420 --> 21:17.990
- Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

21:17.990 --> 21:22.764
that he's not fully experienced
in certain departments?

21:22.764 --> 21:24.370
- [Gordon] No, no.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.450
Are they hosting concerts?

21:26.450 --> 21:27.990
Is it a frat party hangout?

21:27.990 --> 21:28.823
Is it a college?

21:28.823 --> 21:31.330
I mean, how can they
call themselves a hotel?

21:31.330 --> 21:32.750
- That's the difference.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.750
That's the part that we
need to try to separate,

21:34.750 --> 21:36.580
and I've been saying it for a while.

21:36.580 --> 21:37.453
- [Gordon] Yeah.

21:37.453 --> 21:38.286
(phone ringing)
- [Liza] I'm sorry, excuse me.

21:38.286 --> 21:39.520
Good evening, Beachfront Inn.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.950
Liza speaking, how can I help you?

21:41.950 --> 21:42.783
- [Caller] Hi, Liza.

21:42.783 --> 21:47.310
We're in room 20, and
there's a lot of dust,

21:47.310 --> 21:48.720
and it smells like smoke.

21:48.720 --> 21:53.070
And my friend here Gloria's
having a really bad reaction.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.230
She had to take steroids,

21:54.230 --> 21:56.717
and it's supposed to
be a non-smoking room.

21:56.717 --> 21:57.550
- Damn.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.896
- [Liza] I'll be right with you.

21:58.896 --> 22:01.313
(jazz music)

22:03.030 --> 22:05.450
- Brian, there's two guests
who've checked in upstairs.

22:05.450 --> 22:06.283
- [Brian] Okay.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.530
- [Gordon] She's got an
issue with an allergy,

22:10.530 --> 22:12.560
'cause her room stinks of smoke.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.870
It'd be nice if you just
come up and see them

22:13.870 --> 22:15.970
or try and calm the situation down.

22:15.970 --> 22:17.080
So the lady's got an allergy,

22:17.080 --> 22:18.840
and she's already had
to take her steroids,

22:18.840 --> 22:21.520
and her eyes are streaming,
and she's not very happy.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.780
- [Brian] Okay.

22:22.780 --> 22:24.070
- [Gordon] Hello.
- [Female Guest] Hello.

22:24.070 --> 22:25.050
- [Gordon] So are you okay?

22:25.050 --> 22:26.000
- [Female Guest] Yeah, I'm fine.

22:26.000 --> 22:26.833
- [Gordon] You sure?

22:26.833 --> 22:28.075
Any issues?

22:28.075 --> 22:29.270
- [Male Guest] Water all over the floor.

22:29.270 --> 22:30.103
- [Gordon] Sorry?

22:30.103 --> 22:31.544
- We had water all over the floor.

22:31.544 --> 22:32.970
- [Gordon] Water all over the floor?

22:32.970 --> 22:33.803
- [Male Guest] The refrigerator.

22:33.803 --> 22:34.930
- [Female Guest] There's water
on the floor in the room.

22:34.930 --> 22:35.930
- [Gordon] Oh, no, really?
- [Female Guest] Yeah.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.490
- [Male Guest] I just cleaned
it up with a towel, yeah.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.061
- [Gordon] I'm sorry.

22:40.061 --> 22:40.970
Damn.

22:40.970 --> 22:41.920
- [Male Guest] I walked in,

22:41.920 --> 22:44.650
it was completely all the way to the bed.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.844
- [Gordon] Wow, let's come back.

22:46.844 --> 22:47.680
I want to see that--

22:47.680 --> 22:49.840
Well, the lady, her eyes are streaming.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.673
Do excuse us.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.200
Ladies?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.033
Are you decent?

22:56.690 --> 22:58.050
Sorry, I've got the owner here.

22:58.050 --> 23:00.345
- [Guest] I think we've
figured out what that smell is.

23:00.345 --> 23:01.370
- [Gordon] Oh, really?

23:01.370 --> 23:03.530
- [Guest] There's all dust inside.

23:03.530 --> 23:06.190
- [Gordon] Oh, shit, there you go.

23:06.190 --> 23:07.900
- It's just, my eyes are tearing.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.427
- [Gordon] When was that cleaned last?

23:10.427 --> 23:12.410
- [Brian] That's really
a daily thing that...

23:12.410 --> 23:13.280
- [Gordon] Daily?

23:13.280 --> 23:15.610
- [Brian] Yeah, should be,
sure, yeah, absolutely.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.810
- [Gordon] That is not daily.

23:17.810 --> 23:20.990
Look at that.

23:20.990 --> 23:21.843
That's why.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.547
Jesus Christ almighty.

23:27.980 --> 23:30.688
No wonder the poor lady's broken out.

23:30.688 --> 23:34.050
- It's, like, the back of
my throat is all scratchy.

23:34.050 --> 23:36.530
- Is there an alternative room
we can use for the ladies?

23:36.530 --> 23:38.030
- I'll double-check right away.

23:38.030 --> 23:40.690
- Have a drink downstairs,
a little bite to eat,

23:40.690 --> 23:41.732
but we can sort something out.

23:41.732 --> 23:42.565
- Okay.

23:45.292 --> 23:47.875
(Gordon sighs)

23:48.935 --> 23:50.935
- [Gordon] What a night.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.320
The big problem here is
that there's no direction

23:55.320 --> 23:57.430
for the hotel, for the
restaurant, for the gazebo,

23:57.430 --> 23:59.210
not even for the car park.

23:59.210 --> 24:01.360
Ben is like a headless
chicken that's checked out,

24:01.360 --> 24:03.780
and Brian's like this scared school kid

24:03.780 --> 24:06.900
that is not qualified to
run a fucking beach bar,

24:06.900 --> 24:08.270
let alone a hotel on a beach.

24:08.270 --> 24:10.490
So...
(sighs)

24:12.209 --> 24:13.043
This is bad.

24:14.670 --> 24:15.703
This is really grim.

24:17.710 --> 24:19.330
- [James] Brian, am I wrong?

24:19.330 --> 24:21.130
I feel like we blew it tonight.

24:21.130 --> 24:24.410
- No, man, it is what it is, you know.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.260
Don't worry, man.

24:26.187 --> 24:28.687
(funky music)

24:33.455 --> 24:35.036
- [Gordon] Oh, for God's sake.

24:35.036 --> 24:38.050
(upbeat music)

24:38.050 --> 24:40.110
After a very frustrating night,

24:40.110 --> 24:42.640
I woke up this morning hopeful
that Brian would be eager

24:42.640 --> 24:44.573
to admit his faults at the Beachfront.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.060
That wasn't the case.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.000
Even after a staff meeting,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.540
none of the problems are
sinking in with Brian.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.660
So I reached out to his brother Eric

24:53.660 --> 24:55.510
who is continuing to fund the business,

24:55.510 --> 24:58.460
and I'm hoping Brian can
start to see the damage

24:58.460 --> 24:59.293
he has done.

25:00.690 --> 25:02.350
- [Eric] Hey, what's up, guys?

25:02.350 --> 25:03.643
- [Gordon] Thanks for coming in.

25:05.580 --> 25:06.980
- [Eric] Why is Ramsay here?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.560
- Your brother just asked you a question.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.080
Why did you call me here?

25:14.080 --> 25:17.377
- I've got a lot of issues
that I need to take care of.

25:17.377 --> 25:19.360
- You don't look like
a man that's in pain.

25:19.360 --> 25:20.740
You don't look like a
man that's struggling.

25:20.740 --> 25:23.130
You don't look like a
man that's lost control.

25:23.130 --> 25:26.290
You look like you're
bouncing around having fun.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.210
The business is hurting,

25:27.210 --> 25:28.183
you're hurting your brother's business,

25:28.183 --> 25:30.860
and you're not realising it.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.450
- [Eric] It does reach a ceiling

25:32.450 --> 25:34.873
where Brian, you're gonna
have to get cut off.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.310
- I'll respect it, but you got
to let me know how much time,

25:42.310 --> 25:44.350
and I'll make it.

25:44.350 --> 25:45.183
I'll make it.

25:47.340 --> 25:49.240
- Two more months, and then that's it.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.660
- Two months.

25:52.660 --> 25:53.713
- Here's my promise.

25:54.810 --> 25:56.460
I will focus so hard,

25:56.460 --> 26:00.050
and I will be able to
pay you in eight weeks.

26:00.050 --> 26:01.240
I'll pay you in eight weeks.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.150
I'll pay you in eight weeks.

26:03.150 --> 26:04.050
- [Eric] 30 grand.

26:09.081 --> 26:10.330
- You got to give me 90 days.

26:10.330 --> 26:12.080
I mean, you got to give me 90 days.

26:14.010 --> 26:15.300
- He's just given you eight weeks,

26:15.300 --> 26:17.123
you've just asked for 12 weeks.

26:18.490 --> 26:22.870
You can't continue depending
on your little brother's cash

26:22.870 --> 26:25.040
to float your dreams.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.920
- I just need you to make sure

26:26.920 --> 26:28.470
not to screw this one up again.

26:30.510 --> 26:31.910
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.313
- I'm not convinced.

26:35.462 --> 26:36.390
No, no, no.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.340
You're lucky he's your fucking brother.

26:40.150 --> 26:42.160
- [Brian] Eric, I got you, eight months--

26:42.160 --> 26:42.993
- [Eric] Eight weeks.

26:42.993 --> 26:44.540
Eight weeks, or you're cut off.

26:44.540 --> 26:46.304
That's all there is to it, man.

26:46.304 --> 26:48.804
(Brian sighs)

26:49.755 --> 26:52.439
(thunder claps)

26:52.439 --> 26:54.710
(rain pouring)

26:54.710 --> 26:56.890
- [Gordon] How important
is your reputation to you?

26:56.890 --> 26:59.060
- [Brian] That's the most
important thing in my world.

26:59.060 --> 27:00.380
- And on a scale of 1 to 10,

27:00.380 --> 27:02.240
your reputation in this town now?

27:02.240 --> 27:04.200
- I'd give myself a good eight.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.033
- A good eight?

27:05.033 --> 27:06.730
A strong eight?
- [Brian] Absolutely.

27:07.830 --> 27:09.440
- [Gordon] So these are customers

27:09.440 --> 27:10.600
that have gone out of their way

27:10.600 --> 27:13.950
to spend their hard-earned
cash supporting your business.

27:13.950 --> 27:15.490
You must recognise a few of these faces.

27:15.490 --> 27:16.550
- [Brian] Absolutely I do.

27:16.550 --> 27:18.210
- [Gordon] Let's start off with
the lady in the blue shirt.

27:18.210 --> 27:19.123
You know her very well.

27:19.123 --> 27:21.067
- [Brian] Hey, Plythe.
- Hi, Brian.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.880
- How do you know each other?

27:22.880 --> 27:24.140
- I market Brian.

27:24.140 --> 27:25.940
- You're a spokesperson for that business?

27:25.940 --> 27:26.773
- Yes.

27:26.773 --> 27:27.627
- Can you be honest with this one?

27:27.627 --> 27:28.900
- [Plythe] Yes, I can.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.853
The service is very bad.

27:32.870 --> 27:34.410
I've brought people here.

27:34.410 --> 27:36.030
I've been up at the bar myself

27:36.030 --> 27:37.800
trying to order even just a water.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.808
That's been tough.

27:39.808 --> 27:40.870
- Do you not listen to the advice,

27:40.870 --> 27:42.313
in terms of sloppy service?

27:44.048 --> 27:45.940
- Absolutely, I listen.

27:45.940 --> 27:48.740
I do listen, I do listen, I do listen.

27:48.740 --> 27:51.260
- [Gordon] Do you offload
that to your team?

27:51.260 --> 27:52.930
- No, I don't, I don't.

27:52.930 --> 27:55.260
- So that's why it's not dealt with.

27:55.260 --> 27:56.557
Sir, your experience?

27:56.557 --> 27:58.530
- [Diner] We ordered a chicken sandwich.

27:58.530 --> 28:01.441
When the chicken sandwich
came out, it was raw.

28:01.441 --> 28:03.100
It was raw, and it was
mushy in the middle.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.110
I could've got sick from that.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.837
And I love your bar, because
I can come here late night,

28:06.837 --> 28:08.580
and I can get free drinks.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.240
Two for me and two for my
buddy, and pay for one.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.173
We got five.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.420
- Wow, unbelievable.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.253
Sir?

28:15.253 --> 28:17.290
- [Guest] My first experience
here was a Super Bowl party

28:17.290 --> 28:18.130
that you advertised

28:18.130 --> 28:20.310
and I actually had some
out-of-town guests.

28:20.310 --> 28:21.490
Food was very mediocre.

28:21.490 --> 28:23.750
The crab cakes were like sawdust.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.080
They were horrible that night.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.690
After the game was over,

28:26.690 --> 28:29.390
a couple rowdy fans
started a little brawl.

28:29.390 --> 28:31.200
We had drinks thrown on us.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.033
- [Gordon] Wow.

28:32.033 --> 28:33.280
- [Guest] The other
thing I'd like to say is

28:33.280 --> 28:34.990
if I'm staying on the ocean,

28:34.990 --> 28:36.470
I love to fall asleep with the window open

28:36.470 --> 28:38.160
and hear the ocean.

28:38.160 --> 28:38.993
You can't do that here,

28:38.993 --> 28:40.533
you hear music all night long.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.040
- I honestly stayed here myself once.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.670
I tried to call down, because
our sheets were dirty.

28:47.670 --> 28:48.610
You couldn't even call.

28:48.610 --> 28:50.260
Like, nobody answered.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.430
And literally, I think
the biggest problem for me

28:53.430 --> 28:54.540
is the mixed message.

28:54.540 --> 28:57.580
It's like, are you a bar,
or are you a restaurant?

28:57.580 --> 28:59.900
Because we're paying $150 for dinner.

28:59.900 --> 29:03.700
However, there's people
walking in in bikinis, drunk.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.533
- Damn.

29:05.630 --> 29:07.350
Listen, this feedback has been crucial.

29:07.350 --> 29:08.700
Anything you'd like to say?

29:10.220 --> 29:11.370
- [Brian] Thank you guys.

29:11.370 --> 29:12.344
You guys rock, man.

29:12.344 --> 29:13.220
- Hey, man, thanks.
- [Brian] Thank you.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.816
I'm telling you, I'll make
you proud, I promise you.

29:14.816 --> 29:15.649
- [Diner] All right.

29:15.649 --> 29:16.482
(crowd clapping)

29:16.482 --> 29:18.760
- [Gordon] Brian, let's
have a little word.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.593
Let's go.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.220
It's not a time for high-fiving.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.500
Fuck, I'm embarrassed.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.090
What the fuck are you hugging them for?

29:25.090 --> 29:26.780
- [Brian] I know that they
care, I do know they care.

29:26.780 --> 29:28.270
- [Gordon] A raw chicken sandwich?

29:28.270 --> 29:29.573
That's not an eight.

29:30.490 --> 29:31.810
That is not an 8 out of 10.

29:31.810 --> 29:33.380
Do you think they're set up?

29:33.380 --> 29:34.630
Do you think this is a TV show,

29:34.630 --> 29:36.560
and we're just gonna spout off?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.650
These people aren't exaggerating.

29:38.650 --> 29:41.033
They're real, they're real customers.

29:41.900 --> 29:44.558
You're turning into a laughingstock.

29:44.558 --> 29:45.740
- Yeah, I know, it's not good.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.400
- [Gordon] The jury is out with me.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.070
I've never come this far
and still sat on the fence

29:50.070 --> 29:51.630
in an undecided way.

29:51.630 --> 29:54.400
But fucking listen up,
and listen carefully.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.177
The partying, the free-for-all--

29:56.177 --> 29:59.280
"I'm paying for one drink,
they're giving me five,"

29:59.280 --> 30:00.733
in front of your eyes.

30:02.900 --> 30:06.770
Tomorrow you turn up here
looking like an owner.

30:06.770 --> 30:07.603
- Understood.

30:07.603 --> 30:08.960
- [Gordon] You've got a lot on your plate,

30:08.960 --> 30:12.803
but get your head out the
fucking clouds, and get real.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.173
Fuck off.

30:16.173 --> 30:17.650
- [Brian] I've got this, Gordon.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.483
I'll show you.

30:21.895 --> 30:23.553
(suspenseful music)

30:23.553 --> 30:26.386
(water splashing)

30:27.290 --> 30:28.410
- [Gordon] Even though I wasn't won over

30:28.410 --> 30:29.750
by Brian's commitment,

30:29.750 --> 30:33.460
I went ahead and designed a
new concept for the Beachfront.

30:33.460 --> 30:36.060
My team and I completely
overhauled the rooms

30:36.060 --> 30:39.720
and added a beach club to
the unused outdoor space.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.020
I'm really hoping Brian
can see the potential

30:42.020 --> 30:42.953
he has to offer.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.040
Good morning.
- Good morning.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.230
- Well, I wish it was a good morning.

30:48.230 --> 30:50.920
What did I ask you to
come in to work today?

30:50.920 --> 30:51.753
What did I say?

30:51.753 --> 30:52.660
What was the one thing I said to you?

30:52.660 --> 30:53.930
Come in as a...

30:53.930 --> 30:55.890
- Boss.
- A boss.

30:55.890 --> 30:59.943
Right now, you look like a towel boy.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.280
I mean, sunglasses round your neck,

31:04.280 --> 31:06.240
badge on there, shorts on there.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.950
Who are you?

31:07.950 --> 31:09.183
Give me the name badge.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.673
Stand out from the
crowd, you're the owner.

31:19.540 --> 31:22.730
I've had a really rough
night, and so has my team.

31:22.730 --> 31:26.090
Get out of here, get changed,
and come back like an owner.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.440
Now fuck off.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.273
- [Brian] Ready.

31:29.130 --> 31:29.993
- Honestly.

31:31.270 --> 31:32.103
- Gordon--
- [Gordon] Hurry up.

31:32.103 --> 31:34.563
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not listening.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.630
- [Brian] Gordon, I'm
coming back like a boss.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.180
I'm ready to make this whole
Fort Pierce community--

31:41.180 --> 31:42.900
Gordon--
- [Gordon] Get out of here.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.053
Seatbelt on.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.300
No doors and no seatbelt.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.133
Oh, my God.

31:51.615 --> 31:52.897
- [Brian] I'll be back.

31:52.897 --> 31:53.730
- "I'll be back."

31:53.730 --> 31:55.127
- [Brian] And I'll be ready.

32:01.001 --> 32:02.800
(bright orchestral music)

32:02.800 --> 32:05.060
(water splashing)

32:05.060 --> 32:06.807
- [Gordon] Brian returned
looking like an owner,

32:06.807 --> 32:10.050
and I'm hoping that translates
into his role as a boss.

32:10.050 --> 32:10.990
- [Gordon] Let's go.

32:10.990 --> 32:11.823
Joey, quickstep.

32:11.823 --> 32:12.656
Let's go.
- Wow.

32:12.656 --> 32:15.030
- [Gordon] It's time to
reveal to Brian and his staff

32:15.030 --> 32:17.710
the newly renovated
Beachfront Inn and Inlet.

32:17.710 --> 32:19.236
- Oh, my God.

32:19.236 --> 32:20.069
Wow!

32:20.069 --> 32:22.070
- [Liza] This is what I envisioned.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.010
Wow.

32:23.010 --> 32:23.843
- Wow, wow, wow.

32:23.843 --> 32:24.676
- [Gordon] First of all,

32:24.676 --> 32:26.960
this is not the spring break
hangout that's gone wrong,

32:26.960 --> 32:29.260
this is a proper beachfront room.

32:29.260 --> 32:30.133
- [Brian] Sweet.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.399
- Oh, yeah.

32:33.399 --> 32:34.232
Oh, yeah.

32:34.232 --> 32:35.810
- [Brian] It's the Inlet.

32:35.810 --> 32:36.840
- [Joey] It's home.
- [Brian] Oh my God.

32:36.840 --> 32:38.200
- [Joey] Whoa, the floor.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.460
- [Brian] I love it, it's perfect.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.650
- You've got a tangible asset here

32:41.650 --> 32:43.880
that can help lift this business,

32:43.880 --> 32:45.960
and more importantly, start making money.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.793
- Awesome.

32:46.793 --> 32:48.770
- Brian, you need to get
a grip of this business,

32:48.770 --> 32:51.950
and you need to realise
what's at stake here.

32:51.950 --> 32:53.230
I need to be convinced.

32:53.230 --> 32:55.410
I need to see you stepping up as a boss.

32:55.410 --> 32:57.990
Ben and Joey, we're re-launching
that restaurant tonight,

32:57.990 --> 33:00.170
so I'm gonna go through that menu.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.570
Return downstairs, get organised,

33:01.570 --> 33:03.630
and start finding your way.

33:03.630 --> 33:05.275
Let's go.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.273
- [Ben] Oh, man.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.530
- [Gordon] After observing dinner service,

33:10.530 --> 33:12.300
I saw the Beachfront kitchen wasn't set up

33:12.300 --> 33:14.290
to handle such a massive menu.

33:14.290 --> 33:16.510
So I redesigned a smaller menu

33:16.510 --> 33:18.433
that is easy for Ben to execute.

33:19.350 --> 33:20.183
Okay, guys.

33:20.183 --> 33:21.640
Small menu, let's run from the top.

33:21.640 --> 33:22.610
Appetisers.

33:22.610 --> 33:25.870
Lobster mac and cheese done
with the correct pasta, Ben.

33:25.870 --> 33:28.440
Steamed clams, again, great
sharing for the table.

33:28.440 --> 33:32.200
Wings off the smoker, so
it stays nice and crisp,

33:32.200 --> 33:33.510
and a chicken Cobb salad.

33:33.510 --> 33:36.920
Entrees, pan-seared
scallops, easy, three sears.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.670
Ahi tuna, fresh.

33:38.670 --> 33:40.360
And then, of course, the mahi-mahi.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.090
It's small, it's inviting,

33:42.090 --> 33:45.260
and tonight I've just been told

33:45.260 --> 33:47.710
that we've got the mayor in for dinner.

33:47.710 --> 33:49.280
One person we can reach out to

33:49.280 --> 33:52.910
to send the message back in
the community, "This is it."

33:52.910 --> 33:53.743
Dig in.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.030
- [Liza] That sauce is fabulous.

33:57.030 --> 33:57.863
- Oh, my god.

33:59.260 --> 34:00.783
Wow.

34:00.783 --> 34:04.520
(suspenseful orchestral music)

34:04.520 --> 34:06.610
- [Gordon] It's time to
re-launch the Beachfront.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.230
I've put a plan in place,

34:08.230 --> 34:10.639
and I'm really hoping
Brian can finally show me

34:10.639 --> 34:12.320
that he's ready to run his business.

34:12.320 --> 34:13.620
- [Brian] All right, everybody.

34:13.620 --> 34:15.020
Listen up.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.949
Tonight is a big service.

34:16.949 --> 34:19.500
There's not many opportunities like this.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.400
You have to take advantage of it.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.699
I need you guys all to
get together right now

34:23.699 --> 34:24.650
and bring it in.

34:24.650 --> 34:26.007
One, two, three.

34:26.007 --> 34:27.690
- [Everybody] go, Inlet!

34:27.690 --> 34:28.760
(staff cheering)

34:28.760 --> 34:30.510
- [Gordon] Brian, Brian.

34:30.510 --> 34:32.150
Let's just get real for a
couple of seconds, yeah?

34:32.150 --> 34:32.983
- [Brian] Yup, yes, sir.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.420
- You forgot the fucking
most important thing tonight.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.889
Who is in for dinner tonight?

34:37.889 --> 34:39.710
You haven't even told the staff.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.090
Possibly the most important
person in this town.

34:42.090 --> 34:43.407
- We have the mayor in tonight, you guys.

34:43.407 --> 34:45.070
- The mayor, and that's just not something

34:45.070 --> 34:46.730
that happens every fucking week.

34:46.730 --> 34:48.580
You have to bring it together tonight.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.400
You have to work as a team.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.199
Sort it out, guys, we're
opening in five minutes.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.699
- [Brian] Come on.

34:54.699 --> 34:59.080
(suspenseful orchestral music)

34:59.080 --> 34:59.967
- [Liza] Checking in?
- Checking in.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.230
- [Liza] All right.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.350
- [James] Welcome to the Inlet.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.580
- [Brian] Good evening, good evening.

35:03.580 --> 35:05.230
- [Guest] This is lovely.

35:05.230 --> 35:06.120
- Enjoy dinner.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.800
An amazing array of appetisers,

35:08.800 --> 35:10.580
and the entrees are to die for.

35:10.580 --> 35:11.413
- [Joey] Tortoise and the hare.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.560
Slow and steady wins the race.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.098
- [Gordon] So first ticket on, yes?

35:15.098 --> 35:17.471
- [Joey] Yeah.
- [Gordon] Good.

35:17.471 --> 35:18.310
- [Hostess] Hi, how are you?

35:18.310 --> 35:19.233
Welcome to the Inlet.

35:19.233 --> 35:20.478
Hi, guys, just the two of us today?

35:20.478 --> 35:21.347
- It's the mayor.

35:21.347 --> 35:23.257
Okay, yeah, that's the mayor.

35:23.257 --> 35:25.089
Now where are you sitting her?

35:25.089 --> 35:25.922
Come on, where?

35:25.922 --> 35:26.755
- [Brian] Well, they were gonna--

35:26.755 --> 35:27.617
- Well, give her a choice.

35:27.617 --> 35:28.940
"Would you like to sit inside or outside?"

35:28.940 --> 35:30.530
It's her choice.

35:30.530 --> 35:31.867
- Welcome, how are you?

35:31.867 --> 35:33.180
Thank you for coming in.

35:33.180 --> 35:34.491
- [Mayor] So nice to see you.
- [Brian] Thank you guys.

35:34.491 --> 35:35.324
- [Gordon] Likewise.
- [Brian] Thank you.

35:35.324 --> 35:36.480
- [Gordon] It's an absolute pleasure.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.140
I'll leave you in the hands
of our manager-owner Brian.

35:39.140 --> 35:39.980
- Follow me, guys.

35:39.980 --> 35:40.813
- Welcome.

35:40.813 --> 35:41.849
John, good to see you, sir.

35:41.849 --> 35:42.682
Likewise.

35:43.700 --> 35:44.793
- [Brian] Okay, guys.

35:47.340 --> 35:48.200
All right, mayor.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.810
Wherever you'd like inside.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.290
- [Joey] I got a chicken
burger ready at your leisure.

35:52.290 --> 35:54.190
- [Ben] Chicken burger?

35:54.190 --> 35:56.237
- Ben, has Brian told you the mayor's in?

35:56.237 --> 35:57.273
- No, he has not.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.690
- [Gordon] Unreal.

36:00.690 --> 36:04.590
Brian, your chef doesn't
even know the mayor's in.

36:04.590 --> 36:05.650
- Ah.

36:05.650 --> 36:07.420
- [Gordon] You don't
think he deserves to know?

36:07.420 --> 36:08.253
- [Brian] Yes, he does.
- [Gordon] Come on.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.086
Come on, then.

36:09.086 --> 36:10.275
- Ben?
- [Ben] Yes?

36:10.275 --> 36:11.570
- The mayor's in at table seven.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.263
- [Ben] Heard, table seven.
- [Brian] Inside.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.220
- Am I good, Ben?

36:16.220 --> 36:18.897
I've got that blackened chicken for you.

36:18.897 --> 36:20.048
And that's it.

36:20.048 --> 36:20.881
- Thanks for your fucking help.

36:20.881 --> 36:22.110
- [Joey] Ben, you need to be the captain,

36:22.110 --> 36:25.130
and right now I'm not convinced.

36:25.130 --> 36:28.000
Let's get serious about
this business and do this.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.852
- Is the mayor's order in?

36:29.852 --> 36:31.096
Have they sent their appetisers yet?

36:31.096 --> 36:32.123
- [Kelly] Yes, it is.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.220
- Have they hit the table?

36:33.220 --> 36:34.610
- [Kelly] No, I put their food in.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.550
He wanted the salad
and the fried calamari,

36:36.550 --> 36:37.810
and she wanted the mahi.

36:37.810 --> 36:39.190
- Mahi, okay, great.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.610
So again, check it, that's
your hot ticket tonight.

36:40.610 --> 36:43.628
Do you know what's happening
in your kitchen at the moment?

36:43.628 --> 36:44.461
No, look at me.

36:44.461 --> 36:45.471
Do you know what's happening in there?

36:45.471 --> 36:46.304
You haven't got a fucking clue.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.550
You have to get into the kitchen,

36:48.550 --> 36:49.550
find out what's going on.

36:49.550 --> 36:50.383
Let's go.

36:52.570 --> 36:53.770
- [Ben] Look behind you.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.292
Ow, I burned my forehead.

36:57.292 --> 36:58.925
- Oh, man.
- Excuse me.

36:58.925 --> 36:59.758
- [Diner] I'm starving.

36:59.758 --> 37:00.943
- So, What did you guys order?

37:01.920 --> 37:05.863
- I got the mahi-mahi and a
salad, and he got an appetiser.

37:06.770 --> 37:08.560
- The mayor is the only person sat

37:08.560 --> 37:10.010
with nothing in front of her.

37:10.949 --> 37:14.270
- [Brian] Yeah.
- [Gordon] Please?

37:14.270 --> 37:15.773
- [Ben] All right, two tunas.

37:15.773 --> 37:18.440
- Can I have table 15's appetisers ASAP?

37:18.440 --> 37:19.590
It's the mayor.

37:19.590 --> 37:20.930
- [Ben] 15?
- 15.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.810
- [Ben] I was told seven.
- [Gordon] Fucking hell.

37:22.810 --> 37:23.980
- Sorry, miscommunication.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.210
- They're sat on 15, right?

37:25.210 --> 37:26.218
- I made a mistake, it's 15.

37:26.218 --> 37:27.250
- Okay, I need two house salads right now,

37:27.250 --> 37:28.090
before anything else.

37:28.090 --> 37:29.820
Right this second.

37:29.820 --> 37:32.263
- [Joey] Brian didn't know
what table the mayor was at.

37:33.430 --> 37:35.750
It seems like the biggest
thing Brian changed

37:35.750 --> 37:37.070
was his wardrobe.

37:37.070 --> 37:38.100
- Two house are in the window.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.490
Two house need to go, 15.

37:39.490 --> 37:40.540
- Have you seen the salads?

37:40.540 --> 37:41.440
- [Ben] No.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.306
- [Gordon] Ben.
- Yes, sir?

37:42.306 --> 37:43.139
- You need to see that.

37:43.139 --> 37:45.387
You need to taste that and see
everything he's doing there.

37:45.387 --> 37:47.590
- [Ben] Terry, it's
too much dressing, bro.

37:47.590 --> 37:48.423
Redo it.

37:48.423 --> 37:49.256
- His salad's overdressed.

37:49.256 --> 37:51.190
It's soggy as shit, wrong dressing.

37:51.190 --> 37:52.710
Ben?
- [Ben] Yes, sir?

37:52.710 --> 37:54.260
- What I need to hear is a bit of a voice.

37:54.260 --> 37:55.923
If we go silent, we'll go down.

37:56.916 --> 37:59.590
(suspenseful music)

37:59.590 --> 38:01.600
For tonight's re-launch
of the Beachfront...

38:01.600 --> 38:02.550
Salad's overdressed.

38:02.550 --> 38:04.720
Soggy as shit, wrong dressing.

38:04.720 --> 38:07.460
I was really hoping Brian
would step up as an owner,

38:07.460 --> 38:10.360
given that I'd put everything
in place for him to succeed.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.110
- God damn it, dude.

38:12.110 --> 38:14.440
- [Gordon] But his lack of
focus has me really worried

38:14.440 --> 38:16.520
that he's not fit to run this place.

38:16.520 --> 38:17.353
Come on, Brian.

38:17.353 --> 38:18.186
- Chef Ben?

38:19.742 --> 38:20.575
- [Gordon] Come here.

38:20.575 --> 38:22.090
Come here, let's go.

38:22.090 --> 38:23.523
Your chef has shut down.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.553
- [Brian] I didn't realise it.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.386
- You didn't realise,

38:26.386 --> 38:27.780
so the first two salads for the mayor

38:27.780 --> 38:29.700
had the wrong dressing
on and were overdressed.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.560
I said, "Have you tasted
them?" he said, "No."

38:31.560 --> 38:33.010
So he hasn't got your back.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.270
When's that penny gonna drop

38:34.270 --> 38:35.970
that you're gonna turn the corner?

38:37.570 --> 38:38.480
- We'll watch Ben.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.430
If he doesn't come out of it,
we'll switch him and Joey.

38:41.430 --> 38:42.263
- Will you?

38:46.550 --> 38:49.500
- How many guacamoles
you guys got out there?

38:49.500 --> 38:51.560
Okay.
- [Staff Member] Eight.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.970
Chicken, 30 seconds.

38:53.970 --> 38:56.550
- Give me a time on the
mayor's table please, Ben.

38:56.550 --> 38:57.520
- [Ben] Table 15?

38:57.520 --> 38:58.550
- Yeah, the mayor's table.

38:58.550 --> 39:01.030
- We sold it, calamari and a mahi.

39:01.030 --> 39:02.170
- Did you see it before it went?

39:02.170 --> 39:04.740
- [Ben] I sure did, I plated everything.

39:04.740 --> 39:08.387
- The mayor hasn't got the fucking food.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.550
Brian, Brian, urgently, come here.

39:12.550 --> 39:15.352
So Ben's told me the fucking
mayor's got their food.

39:15.352 --> 39:16.185
- [Brian] Right.

39:16.185 --> 39:18.370
- And look at the mayor's table.

39:18.370 --> 39:19.203
There's nothing on there.

39:19.203 --> 39:20.510
Now look at me, look now.

39:20.510 --> 39:22.256
Hey, we're about to go down here.

39:22.256 --> 39:23.820
And I'm gonna get in my fucking car,

39:23.820 --> 39:24.850
and I'm gonna get the fuck out of here

39:24.850 --> 39:26.430
if you don't get a grip,

39:26.430 --> 39:28.110
'cause this is a fucking joke.

39:28.110 --> 39:31.050
Now you better get in there and
tell your executive chef Ben

39:31.050 --> 39:33.080
that the mayor hasn't got their food

39:33.080 --> 39:34.780
and find out where the fuck it is.

39:37.830 --> 39:39.560
- Ben, the mayor has not gotten her food.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.160
- I put it in the window.

39:41.160 --> 39:41.993
- [Brian] Where is the Mayor's food?

39:41.993 --> 39:43.663
- I'll make it right now,
I'll make it right now.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.730
- [Mayor] Be nice to have
some food right about now.

39:47.730 --> 39:49.050
- [Ben] Let's try the mayor's food again.

39:49.050 --> 39:50.390
- [Gina] Terry, I need a Caesar right now.

39:50.390 --> 39:52.180
- [Terry] It's coming right now, Gina.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.013
- Order up.

39:54.950 --> 39:55.783
- [Gordon] Where's that going?

39:55.783 --> 39:56.829
- [Gina] 51.

39:56.829 --> 39:58.163
- 51, come here, you.

40:01.640 --> 40:02.827
What is that?

40:02.827 --> 40:03.942
- [Brian] Undercooked.

40:03.942 --> 40:06.410
- That is undercooked?

40:06.410 --> 40:08.074
Young lady, come here.

40:08.074 --> 40:09.977
What does that chicken look like to you?

40:11.522 --> 40:14.000
- It looks blackened and dry.

40:14.000 --> 40:14.833
- [Gordon] Thank you.

40:14.833 --> 40:15.713
So it's dry.

40:17.570 --> 40:19.970
Young lady, how would you
describe that chicken?

40:21.220 --> 40:22.380
- It looks kind of dry.

40:22.380 --> 40:23.250
- Very dry.
- [Server] Very dry.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.877
- Now you're not even a chef, are you?

40:24.877 --> 40:26.190
- [Server] No, never cooked.
- No, no.

40:26.190 --> 40:27.411
How old are you?
- [Server] I'm 20.

40:27.411 --> 40:28.510
- 20, thanks, darling.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.980
So for a 20-year-old
server who's never cooked,

40:30.980 --> 40:35.478
even she spotted it's dry,
and you're saying it's raw.

40:35.478 --> 40:38.100
Let me tell you something,
and listen carefully.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.270
I'm going.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.880
I'm packing my bags, 'cause
that is the worst thing

40:41.880 --> 40:43.060
you've said all week.

40:43.060 --> 40:46.140
It's overcooked, and
it's dry, and then you,

40:46.140 --> 40:47.503
you tell me it's raw.

40:48.628 --> 40:49.545
Good night.

40:52.987 --> 40:53.820
I'm done.

41:09.044 --> 41:13.010
(sighs) That is unreal.

41:13.010 --> 41:14.870
I mean, I am so pissed off.

41:14.870 --> 41:19.290
I can't give that guy any more advice.

41:19.290 --> 41:22.763
I can't continue to tell him
to step up and make decisions.

41:23.660 --> 41:27.290
He has a chef in there
that's just riding him

41:27.290 --> 41:28.750
and riding the business.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.490
And when you're weak,

41:30.490 --> 41:32.820
you've got no chance
of running a business.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.593
And what a shame.

41:36.530 --> 41:38.499
Un-fucking-real.

41:38.499 --> 41:41.499
(suspenseful music)

41:44.690 --> 41:46.663
- [Joey] Hot, coming around.

41:46.663 --> 41:49.663
(suspenseful music)

41:52.029 --> 41:54.790
(upbeat music)

41:54.790 --> 41:56.460
- [Gordon] I never like
to leave a business,

41:56.460 --> 41:58.600
but Brian simply wasn't listening.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.060
He missed the deadline
paying his brother back,

42:01.060 --> 42:02.800
and while it's been a slow process,

42:02.800 --> 42:05.810
my advice finally started to sink in.

42:05.810 --> 42:08.170
Four months after I
left, he made a decision

42:08.170 --> 42:12.240
to let Chef Ben go and hired
a brand new kitchen staff.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.490
On the hotel side, Brian has
made the guests a priority,

42:15.490 --> 42:18.080
giving the curfew to the
nighttime entertainment.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.030
Hopefully now with Brian
stepping up like a boss,

42:21.030 --> 42:23.723
he can lead the Beachfront
Inn the right direction.

42:56.852 --> 42:58.800
One Potato Two Potato.
