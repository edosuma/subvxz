WEBVTT

01:45.192 --> 01:46.715
[man] I do, I love women.

01:46.758 --> 01:50.675
Yeah, it'’s like
you'’re idealizing women.

01:50.719 --> 01:56.072
Well, I kissed one once,
but that was it.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.900
[chuckles]

02:01.904 --> 02:03.645
I saw your movie.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.037
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.604
-Adaline and Emily?-Mm-hm.

02:09.258 --> 02:11.479
We just met,
so that means a lot to me.

02:11.522 --> 02:13.698
Hm. Yeah.

02:13.742 --> 02:17.398
It was different than
I thought it was going to be.

02:17.441 --> 02:22.359
Like, different having
had met me before, or...

02:22.403 --> 02:24.318
Yeah. I think so.

02:26.711 --> 02:27.843
OK.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.979
Did I tell you that
I used to date a movie producer?

02:34.023 --> 02:38.549
No. Has he, uh,
made anything I'’ve seen, or...?

02:38.593 --> 02:44.381
Uh, he made an indie movie that
was like very character-driven,

02:44.425 --> 02:46.078
kind of like
what you'’re going for.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.298
Oh, well,
I'’ve probably seen it then.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.126
What... what was it called?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.173
Medicine for Melancholy.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.263
I don'’t know.
It sounds familiar.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.829
I don'’t think
I'’ve seen it though.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.570
Maybe it sounds familiar

02:59.614 --> 03:01.833
just because of how
the title is, or...

03:01.877 --> 03:03.748
How well did it do?

03:03.792 --> 03:05.185
I don'’t know.

03:06.708 --> 03:09.232
Well, I mean,
is it worth my time?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.191
Should I see it?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.671
I can'’t say that.
That'’s up to you.

03:13.715 --> 03:17.849
Oh, come on.
Don'’t be coy.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.112
I know it'’s not probably
as good as my film,

03:20.156 --> 03:23.594
but it'’s not easy
to make a movie.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.252
Come on, you can tell me,
on just, like, a personal level,

03:29.296 --> 03:31.602
which one you liked more.

03:31.646 --> 03:36.868
Um... I guess I liked

03:36.912 --> 03:39.219
Medicine for Melancholy.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.097
[sighs]

03:49.707 --> 03:50.882
What?

03:52.406 --> 03:55.060
You can'’t say that.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.976
It'’s just an opinion.
It doesn'’t matter.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.198
[man sighs]

04:09.466 --> 04:12.600
You'’re right. I'm sorry.
I didn'’t think that would
affect me so much.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.646
I'’m going to go.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.474
No, don'’t go.

04:17.517 --> 04:19.214
-Why?
-I'’m sorry.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.478
There...
There'’s no recovering from that.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.437
No, there is.
Sit back down.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.003
[woman sighs]

04:27.789 --> 04:29.747
Sit... c'’mon on I'm sorry.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.626
I said I was sorry.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.629
Now you say you'’re sorry.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.730
[siren blaring]

05:03.346 --> 05:05.479
[people chattering]

05:07.568 --> 05:08.960
[woman laughing]

05:09.004 --> 05:10.701
What'’s your...
[indistinct]

05:10.745 --> 05:13.051
[woman] I do, it'’s probably...
[indistinct]

05:13.095 --> 05:14.444
Hi, I'’m Astor.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.837
Hi.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.230
Um, this is David.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.494
He'’s visiting from New York.
We went to college together.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.670
-And Cheryl.
-[Cheryl] We went to
high school together.

05:22.713 --> 05:23.714
Hi. Hello.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.542
This is Astor.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.153
-This is his first Tinder date.
-Ah, it is. [chuckles]

05:28.197 --> 05:30.112
[David] She has, like, a hundred
thousand followers.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.896
I could text her right now
if you asked.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.724
[Astor]
So you'’re a production designer?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.596
-I am.
-She'’s the best.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.598
That'’s what I hear.
I like your outfit.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.034
Oh, thank you.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.905
You actually look
better in person

05:40.949 --> 05:42.385
than you do in your pictures.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.952
I think you should
get new pictures.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.823
Oh, thanks.
My mom said it'’s always best

05:45.867 --> 05:47.390
to under advertise.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.392
That way you always
exceed expectations.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.525
-Are your parents
still together?
-They are.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.222
That'’s good, I like that.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.746
-Hey, so Tammy Thompson? OK?
-Uh-huh.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.705
-Born again. Married at 19.
-Right.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.620
-Divorced last year.
-Yeah, yeah, Tammy, of course.

05:59.663 --> 06:03.319
-She'’s, like,
an escort in Vegas now.
-Yes. Boobs out.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.235
She'’s like slutting it up
all over the place.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.889
-She'’s in Vegas?
-So what do you guys
think about feminism?

06:07.932 --> 06:09.369
Yes, she'’s going crazy
right now.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.892
Wait, I don'’t understand,
but she...

06:10.935 --> 06:12.328
When did she break up
with her husband?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.199
-Are you a feminist?
-Mike?

06:14.243 --> 06:16.593
-[Astor] Are you a feminist?
-No, she'’s not a prostitute.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.421
-It'’s different than that.
-Are you a feminist?

06:19.509 --> 06:21.381
I like this guy!

06:21.424 --> 06:23.121
He'’s, like, not a man's man.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.689
He'’s like a sensitive guy
I can tell that.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.343
-I like him.
-Honestly.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.779
-I like your shirt.
-Invite him, invite him.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.869
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.306
OK, so, David'’s in town from
New York '’cause he's directing

06:34.350 --> 06:37.048
this play, um, that premieres
next Thursday.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.355
-You should come.
-OK.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
Thank... thanks for the invite.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.576
-So, you'’re a feminist?
-Oh, no.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.013
I don'’t believe in feminism.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.101
[girls chuckling]

06:46.144 --> 06:47.407
No, really, I don'’t.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.147
I think if you thought about it,

06:49.191 --> 06:50.192
you wouldn'’t either.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.541
No, I'’m a feminist.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.064
I went to Vassar
for Christ sake.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.457
Well, but you don'’t
wanna work though.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.241
-Of course I do.
-No, you don'’t.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.983
Ooh... I don'’t?

06:59.027 --> 07:02.030
I mean, don'’t get me wrong,
I'’m... I'm... I'’m pro-women

07:02.073 --> 07:05.425
and I think anybody should be
able to do anything they want,
regardless of gender.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.644
All I'’m saying is,
we are animal beings who have

07:07.688 --> 07:09.516
developed over millions of years
of evolution

07:09.559 --> 07:12.649
and during this whole period,
of millions of years,

07:12.693 --> 07:14.216
men have done this one
very specific thing,

07:14.259 --> 07:15.870
and women have done
this other thing.

07:15.913 --> 07:19.351
And then come 1967,
that all changes? Forever?

07:19.395 --> 07:20.788
Is that gonna last?

07:20.831 --> 07:23.268
Because,
evolutionarily speaking,

07:23.312 --> 07:24.879
it'’s just been a blip.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.969
[line trilling]

07:30.928 --> 07:33.191
-[woman] Hello?
-Hey... Hey, Mom.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.544
Hey, honey. It'’s late.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.850
Is everything all right?

07:39.894 --> 07:43.201
Yeah, I'’m sorry,
are you still up?

07:43.245 --> 07:45.116
-Is it OK? -It'’s OK.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.423
What'’s up?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.120
Did you find a job?

07:49.164 --> 07:53.647
[groans] I told you,
I'’m not looking for a job.

07:53.690 --> 07:57.172
Oh, how can you say that?

07:57.215 --> 08:01.524
Because I'’m not interested
in what the world is offering me
right now.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.571
You know how difficult it is
for somebody like me?

08:04.614 --> 08:07.922
I'’m not gonna take
some soulless job
on some daytime talk show.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.011
I'’m hedging my bet.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.883
What does that mean?

08:12.927 --> 08:15.016
[sighs] It means I'’m better,

08:15.059 --> 08:17.497
than what things
have to offer me right now.

08:19.411 --> 08:24.025
OK, well... how'’s the movie going?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.811
I'’m making a new movie.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.075
It'’s... It stars Taylor...

08:31.119 --> 08:32.511
Touring.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.253
Who'’s that?

08:35.297 --> 08:36.951
[whispering] Oh, my God.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.868
I can'’t even believe
I'’m from you two.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.394
Well, what does Valerie think?

08:45.437 --> 08:48.266
I haven'’t told Valerie,
we'’re taking a break.

08:48.310 --> 08:51.226
It'’s none of her business,
but...

08:51.269 --> 08:53.228
if she knew, she'’d agree.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.841
How long have you been taking a break for?

08:59.190 --> 09:01.105
[sighs]

09:02.759 --> 09:04.674
I went on a date tonight.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.112
Mmkay, how was that?

09:10.288 --> 09:11.594
Well...

09:14.162 --> 09:16.425
she'’s a production designer

09:16.468 --> 09:21.604
and her ex-boyfriend'’s
Quentin Tarantino,
so there'’s that.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.476
Oh, she talked about her ex-boyfriend?

09:24.520 --> 09:27.262
No, Mom, she didn'’t talk about
her ex-boyfriend, I googled her,

09:27.305 --> 09:28.916
that'’s what people do now.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.571
I gotta go.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.486
Oh, all right. Well, I love you.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.315
I love you, too.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.617
Uh, you guys wanna
start with 17?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.531
Is that all right? OK.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.665
Um, we can just pretend
this uh...

10:22.709 --> 10:25.363
-[giggles]
-We'’ll pretend this, uh, sofa

10:25.407 --> 10:29.411
is that dumpster
you guys are sitting up against,
and, um ...

10:29.454 --> 10:32.675
I guess, Taylor if you wanna
start standing and walk into it?

10:32.719 --> 10:33.850
If that works for you?

10:33.894 --> 10:35.852
-Mm-hm.
-OK.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.115
Um, so, again, I know we talked
about this, both, one-on-one,

10:38.159 --> 10:40.683
but what'’s important
is just to hit the major
emotional beats.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.904
So, if there'’s anything that
doesn'’t seem like the way you
would say it,

10:43.947 --> 10:47.298
or, it just isn'’t working
for you, feel free to put it
in your own words.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.300
It'’s completely fine, OK?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.475
-You good?
-[Taylor] Mm-hm.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.347
All right, and action.

10:55.698 --> 10:58.005
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

10:58.048 --> 11:00.964
Sit down. C'’mon, sit.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.706
Hey, everything'’s
going to be OK.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.013
OK? Look at me.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.623
Look.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.756
We'’re gonna call the police,
all right?

11:09.799 --> 11:11.409
And we'’re gonna
get your money back.

11:11.453 --> 11:14.369
E... everything'’s gonna
work out.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.633
Are you fucking kidding me?
The police?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.504
You wanna call
the fucking police?!

11:19.548 --> 11:21.855
Do you think that the police
actually care about this?

11:21.898 --> 11:23.595
We'’re just a bunch of kids!

11:23.639 --> 11:25.467
Are you serious?!

11:26.686 --> 11:29.036
[boy] Look at me.

11:29.079 --> 11:32.822
Uh, I didn'’t think you'd,
uh, really like me.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.177
I lied about everything.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.354
That money is everything.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.575
I have nothing, OK?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.145
And...

11:52.363 --> 11:53.713
I love you.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.851
[Astor] All right!

12:01.895 --> 12:03.853
[Astor and Taylor laughing]

12:03.897 --> 12:05.420
[Astor]
Thanks. That was great.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.509
Great, that was great.
On this next one,

12:07.552 --> 12:09.729
let'’s just do one thing
a little bit different.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.643
[woman giggling]

12:12.775 --> 12:13.950
What'’s this script?

12:13.994 --> 12:17.519
"I Am Jeffrey... Deetch"?

12:17.562 --> 12:21.044
[Astor] Ah, it'’s "Deitch."
It'’s just this sci-fi thing
I wrote.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.875
Have you, uh, heard of
"Refrigerator Play"?

12:25.919 --> 12:27.659
What'’s that?

12:27.703 --> 12:29.705
[Astor] It'’s where I lock you
in my refrigerator

12:29.749 --> 12:33.274
and only let you out to perform
volatile sexual acts

12:33.317 --> 12:37.104
you'’d otherwise be
too embarrassed to perform.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.719
Izzy? What'’s the matter?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.852
[chuckles] Nothing.

12:46.853 --> 12:47.810
I'’m OK.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.638
All right.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.466
I just don'’t want you to think
that just because we met,

12:51.509 --> 12:54.164
you know, tonight,
that you can'’t tell me stuff.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.863
I think it'’s best,
just to get everything out,

12:56.906 --> 12:58.778
at the beginning, you know?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.562
Everybody'’s got baggage.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.088
You'’re right, but I'm OK.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.612
All right.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.006
How long you been single?

13:12.574 --> 13:14.489
Like a month?

13:14.532 --> 13:16.970
That'’s not very long.
[chuckles]

than even today.

It literally sounded like
a book by Dr. Seuss,
but way longer and worse.

And nobody even knows that
because the whole crowd comes up
to the minister afterwards,

28:45.071 --> 28:47.769
and they'’re like
"Lovely words, lovely words."

28:47.813 --> 28:50.424

how they remembered her?

29:40.256 --> 29:43.433
-Mm. -And this is not in order to change it,

29:43.477 --> 29:45.261
but in order to know.

29:47.568 --> 29:52.529
-Mm. -And please remember, that, in loving-kindness practice,

29:52.573 --> 29:57.186
the intention is the most important thing.

29:57.230 --> 30:03.845
The intention to develop a more open and friendly heart.

30:03.889 --> 30:07.066
Towards yourself and towards everybody you...

30:29.610 --> 30:32.091
[doorbell ringing

30:36.008 --> 30:37.052
Who is it?

30:38.140 --> 30:39.098
[Valerie] It'’s me.

30:40.708 --> 30:41.883
[door locks]

30:49.978 --> 30:51.893
[music playing]

30:54.069 --> 30:55.114
[door opens]

30:55.157 --> 30:57.072
Astor, open the door.

30:57.116 --> 30:59.988
[Astor] Not until you agree
to not move out.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.076
[Valerie] Astor.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.384
Astor.

31:04.427 --> 31:07.300
That'’s the deal. I don't quit.

31:07.343 --> 31:09.519
It'’s my best quality.

31:09.563 --> 31:10.956
You said we were gonna
talk about this.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.436
We did. Ad nauseam.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.874
[man] You'’re only making this
harder on yourself, mate.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.311
Why is he here?

31:18.354 --> 31:20.139
[Valerie] To help me move.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.445
Fuck you, for real?

31:22.489 --> 31:24.317
You'’re going to bring
a stranger into this?

31:25.492 --> 31:26.928
Please, open the door.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.329
We'’re gonna talk.

31:41.769 --> 31:44.903
-Turn this off.
-It'’s our song.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.993
Have you become
a Scientologist now, too?

31:48.036 --> 31:49.255
Don'’t be mean.

31:50.647 --> 31:51.735
This is so hard for me.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.041
I have nowhere to go.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.609
Then don'’t go.
I want you here!

31:57.306 --> 31:58.481
No, you don'’t.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.180
That'’s not true.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.833
Are you sleeping with him?

32:02.877 --> 32:05.749
He'’s my sister's boyfriend.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.969
You know why we'’re
breaking up don'’t you, mate?

32:08.013 --> 32:09.710
Because I won'’t become
a Scientologist.

32:09.753 --> 32:11.233
Don'’t think you're not next.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.975
Hey, hey, hey.
Don'’t do this, all right?

32:14.019 --> 32:15.542
You should just step out.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.807
Nobody'’s making me
a Scientologist.

32:19.850 --> 32:20.895
That'’s fine.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.075
I'’m gonna go get a Mexican Coke.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.923
C'’mon, will you just
talk to me for a second?

32:50.272 --> 32:51.795
This isn'’t easy, you know?

33:00.282 --> 33:02.284
Do you love me?

33:02.328 --> 33:06.332
Of course, I do, but sometimes
that just isn'’t enough.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.724
All you need is love.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.988
No, that'’s a song.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.511
[man] Hey. You guys moving out?

33:11.554 --> 33:12.729
-I am.
-No.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.950
Ah, shit. Sorry.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.169
It'’s OK.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.475
All right, I'’ll see ya, Val.

33:19.519 --> 33:20.737
Good luck.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.743
C'’mon, let's just
move this back upstairs.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.006
It'’s not too late.

33:31.705 --> 33:34.273
You came to my
grandmother'’s funeral,

33:34.316 --> 33:37.276
who you know raised me,
and you pulled people aside

33:37.319 --> 33:39.234
and said they were
in a dangerous cult.

33:44.326 --> 33:47.025
I'’ll see you at
your sister'’s birthday party

33:47.068 --> 33:49.244
and we'’ll talk about it more.
OK?

34:01.169 --> 34:03.041
Everything'’s going to be
all right.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.969
[woman on TV] Feeling, ah, lonely...

34:19.013 --> 34:22.277
The nuclear family is, uh, is, uh, you know...

34:22.321 --> 34:24.192
It'’s a cell, it'’s like a prison cell.

34:24.235 --> 34:26.803
Most societies in history of the world,

34:26.847 --> 34:30.545
you have people living in the extended family unit,

34:30.590 --> 34:33.592
it'’s a tribal family with multiple generations living in the same house,

34:33.636 --> 34:37.684
and shared labor, OK, and companionship and so on...

34:37.726 --> 34:40.817
Where women are going home from the office where they may have a very...

34:40.860 --> 34:41.775
[line trilling]

34:43.168 --> 34:44.342
Hey, what'’s up, Astor?

34:44.386 --> 34:45.779
Sup, dude?

34:45.822 --> 34:47.998
How ya doin'’ man?
How ya feelin'’?

34:48.042 --> 34:49.435
[groans]

34:51.393 --> 34:52.960
Not so good.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.486
You wanna get a drink?

34:57.530 --> 34:59.923
Uh, yea. Stand by.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.186
Hey, Gloria.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.362
Um, Astor needs to grab a drink.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.496
Yeah, you know? Gloria'’s sick.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.019
I just... I don'’t think tonight'’s good.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.805
Just one drink, man.
I, um...

35:17.593 --> 35:18.855
Valerie moved out.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.296
Valerie moved out.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.777
And I'’m pregnant.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.650
-So, unless you want me to---[man] Hey, man, you know,

35:30.693 --> 35:32.695
just... tonight'’s just not gonna work.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.697
But, later this week, for sure, we'’ll find some time.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.090
Um, you know what you should do?

35:36.134 --> 35:37.265
You should go downstairs.

35:37.309 --> 35:38.484
Just get real fucked up.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.050
You know what they say,

35:40.094 --> 35:41.617
the best way to get over somebody

35:41.661 --> 35:43.184
is to get on top of somebody new.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.362
[groans]

35:47.406 --> 35:48.450
All right.

35:49.625 --> 35:50.974
We'’ll, uh...

35:53.238 --> 35:54.630
do it later this week, man.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.806
All right, uh, later.

35:56.850 --> 35:57.764
Bye.

37:15.798 --> 37:20.760
So, you'’re a dancer...

37:20.803 --> 37:22.022
Mm-hmm.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.415
Like, at Rick'’s?

37:23.458 --> 37:26.069
A modern dance company.

37:26.113 --> 37:28.594
[chuckles] OK.

37:28.637 --> 37:33.599
And you'’re a survivalist?

37:33.642 --> 37:35.253
Is that a job?

37:35.296 --> 37:38.081
Well, it'’s like a little bit
more of a hobby.

37:38.125 --> 37:43.652
But I think it sets
a pretty solid foundation,
morally, for a man.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.741
OK. [chuckles]

37:45.785 --> 37:48.875
So, like,
you have an earthquake kit.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.617
Did you hear me? I said
I'’m a professional survivalist.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.402
Do you know what that means?
I have, like, four months

37:54.446 --> 37:57.536
of freeze-dried food for two,
forty gallons of water,

37:57.579 --> 38:01.104
a water filter for radiation,
iodide pills,

38:01.148 --> 38:05.718
gold, silver, a thousand rounds
of ammunition, a shotgun...

38:05.761 --> 38:07.067
-You have a gun?
-...with two--

38:07.110 --> 38:09.025
Well, I have, like, a shotgun.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.375
Like a... [makes shotgun sound]
for the sound mainly,

38:10.418 --> 38:11.637
as opposed to a handgun.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.029
Wait, here in this house?

38:13.073 --> 38:15.031
-Yeah.
-Are you fucking crazy?

38:15.075 --> 38:18.426
Oh, trust me, it'’s necessary.
You'’d like it.

38:18.470 --> 38:22.212
As a woman, I think it would
probably make you feel secure.

38:24.737 --> 38:27.957
But why do you have
all this stuff?

38:28.001 --> 38:32.179
Mm, it was like
a hormonal response.

38:32.222 --> 38:36.966
Uh, I was moving in
with my first girlfriend,

38:37.010 --> 38:40.361
-and we got this puppy and--
-Oh, what kind?

38:40.405 --> 38:42.189
Mm, it was a French Bulldog.

38:42.232 --> 38:45.497
-That'’s so cute! I love dogs.
-Yeah.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.500
So, this thing just
kicked in where I realized

38:48.543 --> 38:50.284
if something bad happened
I'’d be the one responsible,

38:50.328 --> 38:51.764
and I just didn'’t want this
thing on my conscience,

38:51.807 --> 38:53.418
like, I'’d have to
call her dad up and be like,

38:53.461 --> 38:54.984
"Oh! I'’m sorry, sir,

38:55.028 --> 38:57.857
I'’m a pussy,
your daughter'’s dead." Or...

38:57.900 --> 38:59.772
Then I lost my dog.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.210
That'’s so sad
that you lost your dog.

39:03.253 --> 39:06.605
Yeah,
I mean, like, technically, yeah.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.477
I mean,
it was a domestic dispute.

39:09.521 --> 39:12.045
You know how these things go,
the women always gets the kids.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.657
You poor thing.

39:15.701 --> 39:19.226
Aw, you'’re really empathetic.

39:21.271 --> 39:22.925
Somebody just left you.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.016
[groans] I knew it.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.845
[groans] There'’s just
no other way to explain

39:29.889 --> 39:31.543
someone as pretty as you
being alone at a bar

39:31.586 --> 39:33.980
and then back here
so quickly with me.

39:34.023 --> 39:37.766
I'’m just... I mean, it's OK.
Everybody gets hurt.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.899
I mean, if that'’s what happened.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.337
We don'’t have to talk about it.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.121
[sighs] I'’m sorry.
I shouldn'’t have said anything.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.340
But, let me just say
one more thing.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.646
What I really mean...

39:47.689 --> 39:49.909
What I meant to say

39:49.952 --> 39:54.000
was that I'’m 100 percent certain
that he did not deserve you.

40:03.923 --> 40:05.577
You wanna see my gun?

40:05.620 --> 40:08.057
[chuckle] All right.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.712
-I don'’t usually--
-It'’s OK. I'll be right back.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.226
[gun cocks]

40:46.269 --> 40:48.533
What the fuck are you doing?

40:48.576 --> 40:50.099
-It'’s my gun.
-It'’s a real gun?!

40:50.143 --> 40:51.536
You said you wanted to see it.

40:51.579 --> 40:52.798
Oh, my God,
you'’re a fucking psycho,

40:52.841 --> 40:54.495
stay the fuck away from me!

40:54.539 --> 40:56.671
What? I said,
"Do you wanna see my gun?"

40:56.715 --> 40:58.978
-And you said, "Yes."
-I thought you were
talking about your dick.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.807
Whoa! Whoa! It'’s locked.

41:01.850 --> 41:04.331
-It doesn'’t fire, it can't fire.
-Do not follow me.

41:20.347 --> 41:21.783
How are things?

41:21.827 --> 41:26.005
-Hectic. But when are they not?
-Yeah.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.615
Thanks for doing this.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.225
-It'’s no problem.
-I really appreciate it.

41:29.269 --> 41:31.227
[man]
Hey, guys, uh,
let'’s get started.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.360
Thanks for coming
out here today,
I really appreciate it.

41:33.403 --> 41:35.493
Um, let'’s just quickly
go around the room
and introduce ourselves.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.103
Lawrence, one of the producers.

41:37.146 --> 41:39.148
Henry, other producer.

41:39.192 --> 41:41.020
Regina, Costumes.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.805
Astor Williams Stevenson,
writer-director.

41:43.849 --> 41:45.677
May, DP.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.330
Max, PM.

41:47.374 --> 41:49.115
Irina, production designer.

41:49.158 --> 41:51.030
James, first AD.

41:51.073 --> 41:53.336
All right guys, uh, thanks
for trekking this far east.

41:53.380 --> 41:55.513
It'’s easier on us,
we'’re wrapping our
last movie outta here.

41:55.556 --> 41:58.385
Um, wanted to get you guys
all here together
for two reasons today.

41:58.428 --> 42:00.996
First, just to put
everybody in the same room
together with Astor,

42:01.040 --> 42:03.346
talk about the big picture;
the vision of this film.

42:03.390 --> 42:07.568
And, second,
so Henry here can say, "No,"
to all of your budget requests.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.570
Or yes. So, good news.

42:09.614 --> 42:12.355
We have locked
the horse track location.

42:12.399 --> 42:16.577
So, I will be available
to answer logistical questions

42:16.621 --> 42:18.797
on that
at the end of the meeting.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.495
Right now, I think,
Astor'’s gonna say a few things.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.021
It'’s real simple.
I just...

42:26.065 --> 42:28.589
I know this is a story
about young love,

42:28.633 --> 42:33.159
and I know it'’s a story about
two people who were damaged
earlier in life,

42:33.202 --> 42:38.468
but I just want to make sure
we'’re also telling
a much broader story about hope.

42:38.512 --> 42:42.777
Um, I wanna show that
two damaged people

42:42.821 --> 42:44.997
can actually be there
for each other.

42:45.040 --> 42:49.436
And I just wanna have a movie
with a happy ending, you know?

42:49.479 --> 42:53.571
So many independent films,
almost all of them,

42:53.614 --> 42:57.487
end without any sense
of hopefulness for this world,

42:57.531 --> 42:59.751
or for love,
or really for anything,

42:59.794 --> 43:02.318
and I'’m just sick of that,
and I think it'’s bullshit.

43:02.362 --> 43:06.279
Um, these characters
are very damaged,
they'’re sexually confused,

43:06.322 --> 43:08.847
and they'’re coming up against
a lot of obstacles,

43:08.890 --> 43:12.372
but it'’s really not
so much easier in real life,

43:12.415 --> 43:16.681
and people are seeming to
make it work every single day.

43:16.724 --> 43:19.074
So, let'’s show that.

43:19.118 --> 43:22.861
The more positive side
of things, and, um...

43:22.904 --> 43:24.950
make it real at the same time.

43:40.966 --> 43:43.098
-Hey!
-Hey, How'’s it goin'?

43:43.142 --> 43:44.883
How'’s it goin'?

43:44.926 --> 43:46.319
Uh, I'’m good.

43:46.362 --> 43:48.364
-How are you?
-I'’m good.

43:48.408 --> 43:51.411
-This way.
-Nice, uh, outfit you got there.

43:51.454 --> 43:53.631
[chuckles] Thank you.

43:53.674 --> 43:56.851
-I think. I think...
-You... you look good.

43:56.895 --> 43:59.027
-Thanks.
-Very spiffy.

44:03.466 --> 44:07.557
-Oh! Sorry.
-Sorry... sorry.

44:07.601 --> 44:10.865
Did you just do that thing,
'’cause... 'cause I'’m a girl
and you'’re a boy?

44:10.909 --> 44:13.215
Uh, I think so, yeah.

44:14.826 --> 44:16.001
I like that.

44:22.094 --> 44:23.443
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.012
How long have you
been single for?

44:27.055 --> 44:28.666
Uh, like a week.

44:28.709 --> 44:30.668
-Oh, wow. OK.
-How '’bout you?

44:30.711 --> 44:33.627
Um, definitely more than a week.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.977
So, you'’re not even,
like, really single yet.

44:36.021 --> 44:37.762
-Well...
-Are you kind of, like,

44:37.805 --> 44:40.460
worried that someone'’s
gonna see you and me?

44:40.503 --> 44:42.070
We should just get married.
[chuckles]

44:42.114 --> 44:43.593
Tonight?

44:43.637 --> 44:44.638
Yeah.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.161
All right. Maybe!

44:46.205 --> 44:47.641
Maybe we should, like,

44:47.685 --> 44:48.816
see how good
the play is first, though.

44:48.860 --> 44:50.688
-All right.
-OK?

44:52.254 --> 44:54.561
[music playing]
[people chattering]

45:02.525 --> 45:04.223
[David]
Oh, hey, where'’ve you been?

45:04.266 --> 45:05.790
You almost made her miss
the beginning of the show.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.661
I said I couldn'’t go in
without you, so...

45:07.705 --> 45:09.750
I was just right over there
getting us drinks.

45:09.794 --> 45:12.100
You can'’t bring
those in actually,
we'’re about to start, so...

45:12.144 --> 45:14.059
I'’m not gonna throw
them away. The lights
haven'’t even cued yet.

45:14.102 --> 45:16.191
What about all
these other people?

45:16.235 --> 45:18.367
They'’re not for me!
There'’s, like, four other shows
here. We all share a lobby.

45:18.411 --> 45:19.455
Uh, here, you know...

45:21.370 --> 45:23.546
-Thanks for coming though.
-Mm-hm. You know me,

45:23.590 --> 45:25.679
I'’m a huge supporter
of Avant Garde theatre.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.550
Totally, of course,
and I think as a director

45:27.594 --> 45:28.900
you'’re really going to
appreciate this.

45:30.118 --> 45:31.729
[people chattering]

45:35.689 --> 45:36.908
You wanna sit over there?

45:36.951 --> 45:38.605
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That'’s fine.

45:38.648 --> 45:40.389
I don'’t know why we had to rush?

45:40.433 --> 45:41.826
He'’s just nervous, you know?

45:41.869 --> 45:43.001
It'’s, uh...
It'’s his first night.

45:43.044 --> 45:44.654
You know how it is.

45:44.698 --> 45:47.919
Secretively,
I hate stuff like this.

45:47.962 --> 45:50.573
I know Avant Garde is just...
it just means shit.

45:50.617 --> 45:52.271
I'’m so glad you said that.

45:52.314 --> 45:54.708
I was just feigning excitement
to impress you.

45:57.842 --> 46:00.670
[heavy breathes]

46:01.889 --> 46:03.499
-Should we?
-We could.

46:03.543 --> 46:04.805
-He wouldn'’t know.
-He thinks we'’re gross.

46:04.849 --> 46:06.502
-Disgusting.
-We are?

46:06.546 --> 46:09.592
-We crawl all over...
-His clothes...

46:09.636 --> 46:10.985
-All over his bed.
-Loves only him.

46:11.029 --> 46:12.465
-Only him.
-Only him.

46:12.508 --> 46:13.988
-Only.
-Only him.

46:14.032 --> 46:16.251
-Only.
-Only him.

46:16.295 --> 46:17.557
Only him.

46:17.600 --> 46:18.776
-Only him.
-Only him.

46:18.819 --> 46:20.995
[all repeating "Only him."]

46:24.694 --> 46:25.652
Me!

46:32.050 --> 46:32.964
Me.

46:36.097 --> 46:37.751
Me.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.101
[making grunting noises]

46:44.845 --> 46:46.020
Me.

46:50.155 --> 46:52.244
[all making grunting noises]

46:59.773 --> 47:01.253
[banging]

47:03.168 --> 47:04.909
[man] Us.

47:04.952 --> 47:06.649
-At the end of--
-At the end of the--

47:06.693 --> 47:09.304
-End of the world.
-As the end of the world...

47:11.872 --> 47:13.482
Begins.

47:15.789 --> 47:20.794
[all breathe deeply]

47:26.365 --> 47:28.193
The Gimlet.

47:28.236 --> 47:31.370
Incredibly refreshing drink.
Unfortunately, it'’s British.

47:31.413 --> 47:33.285
[chuckles]
Cheers.

47:35.069 --> 47:36.375
Mm, it'’s so good.
Thank you.

47:36.418 --> 47:37.767
You are welcome.

47:39.421 --> 47:40.901
It'’s one of the few things
I can do right.

47:40.945 --> 47:42.207
-That you can do right?
-Yeah.

47:42.250 --> 47:44.687
Oh, yeah. No. So far, yeah.

47:44.731 --> 47:48.691
Mm, so,
can I tell you something?

47:48.735 --> 47:51.651
Depends. Do you wanna
compliment me some more or...

47:51.694 --> 47:53.871
No. There'’s no more
complements tonight.

47:53.914 --> 47:55.002
-OK.
-That'’s it.

47:55.046 --> 47:57.178
Um, yeah, so, my...

47:57.222 --> 47:59.572
my ex is actually
Quentin Tarantino.

47:59.615 --> 48:01.748
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, but that...
that'’s not why

48:01.791 --> 48:03.402
-I'’m production designing
his next film.
-[chuckles]

48:03.445 --> 48:05.578
I don'’t...
I don'’t want you to think that.

48:05.621 --> 48:08.755
-Of course. Of course.
-No.

48:08.798 --> 48:10.191
That'’s not why I was laughing.

48:10.235 --> 48:12.367
-[laughs] OK! I didn'’t know.
-Yeah.

48:12.411 --> 48:14.674
I... I mean, does it bother you?

48:14.717 --> 48:17.633
That... that I dated him, or...?

48:17.677 --> 48:19.984
Because he'’s your
father'’s age or...?

48:20.027 --> 48:21.811
-No.
-No, I mean, why would it?

48:21.855 --> 48:25.467
I mean, you know.
It'’s like, you're a director,

48:25.511 --> 48:27.339
he'’s a director.
He'’s just like a little,

48:27.382 --> 48:29.950
just like a tiny bit more,
maybe, established than you?

48:29.994 --> 48:31.473
I don'’t know.
A little more successful?

48:31.517 --> 48:32.910
All right, fair.

48:32.953 --> 48:36.000
-Um... not really.
-Mm-hm.

48:36.043 --> 48:38.437
I'’m not really
the jealous type, so, it'’s fine.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.004
-Here, come here.
-OK.

48:40.047 --> 48:42.223
-It'’s OK.
-It'’s all right?

48:42.267 --> 48:44.051
-Everybody makes mistakes.
-You forgive me?

48:44.095 --> 48:45.835
[laughing]

48:45.879 --> 48:46.967
No, I don'’t mean that.

48:47.011 --> 48:47.968
I'’m sorry.

49:04.071 --> 49:08.380
Hey, um,
do you wanna sleep over?

49:08.423 --> 49:09.903
Mm...

49:10.730 --> 49:11.861
Maybe.

49:11.905 --> 49:13.298
I mean, you don'’t have to.

49:13.341 --> 49:15.039
-Mm-hm.
-Do whatever you want, but--

49:15.082 --> 49:16.562
Good, thank you.

49:16.605 --> 49:18.825
[chuckles]
I'’m glad I have free will.

49:18.868 --> 49:21.088
-But if you want to...
-Mm-hm.

49:21.132 --> 49:24.831
-I could give you
a new toothbrush...
-OK.

49:24.874 --> 49:27.834
...and a t-shirt
of your picking.

49:27.877 --> 49:30.054
-A t-shirt? That'’s--
-You don'’t get to keep it.

49:30.097 --> 49:32.056
What?! That... OK.

49:32.099 --> 49:34.797
-But you can pick out your own.
-I can... but can I borrow it?

49:34.841 --> 49:36.451
-For the night.
-OK.

49:36.495 --> 49:38.323
I wanna...
I wanna see these t-shirts.

49:38.366 --> 49:40.542
-I'’m actually very, very
excited about this...
-OK.

49:40.586 --> 49:42.153
-All right,
I'’ll show it to you then.
-OK.

49:42.196 --> 49:44.155
-Can I take this inside?
-You may.

49:44.198 --> 49:45.721
OK. OK.

49:49.116 --> 49:50.683
You'’re so fun.

49:50.726 --> 49:52.511
-What?
-You'’re... [indistinct]

49:54.295 --> 49:55.601
I'’m normal.

49:55.644 --> 49:57.603
I think you'’re just...

49:57.646 --> 50:00.562
haven'’t been with somebody
as young as me in a while.

50:28.851 --> 50:29.983
[moans]

50:31.202 --> 50:32.855
You don'’t have to do that.

50:33.726 --> 50:34.857
It'’s OK.

50:36.511 --> 50:38.905
I mean, I don'’t really like it,
so...

50:41.386 --> 50:43.649
-All right.
-You lie down.

50:55.878 --> 50:57.184
[moans]

51:04.713 --> 51:06.498
OK, just relax.

51:45.754 --> 51:48.670
[grunting]

51:52.761 --> 51:54.111
[gagging]

51:56.722 --> 51:58.463
[coughing]

51:58.506 --> 52:01.901
[panting]

52:01.944 --> 52:03.946
Are... Are you OK?

52:03.990 --> 52:05.905
[woman]
Uh, does it smell?

52:07.428 --> 52:09.082
Did you throw up?

52:10.736 --> 52:13.739
Uh, yeah.
I think I threw up on your dick.

52:13.782 --> 52:15.697
[sighs]

52:15.741 --> 52:17.699
Yeah, I think you did.
[chuckles]

52:17.743 --> 52:19.353
Does it smell?

52:20.528 --> 52:24.402
Uh, a little. It'’s OK.

52:28.362 --> 52:29.624
It'’s OK.

52:29.668 --> 52:31.583
Yeah. I know, thank you.

52:31.626 --> 52:33.889
Can you... can you
hop in the shower, please?

52:35.152 --> 52:36.153
You came in my throat.

52:36.196 --> 52:37.545
You'’re fine.

52:39.199 --> 52:40.983
[shower runs]

52:43.943 --> 52:46.424
That was a first.

52:46.467 --> 52:48.730
-What?
-I said, "That was a first."

52:48.774 --> 52:50.993
I'’ve never thrown up
on someone before.

52:51.037 --> 52:52.865
-Do you throw up a lot?
-No!

52:52.908 --> 52:54.388
This is all your fault,
you know.

52:54.432 --> 52:55.737
How'’s that?

52:55.781 --> 52:57.826
Your dick'’s too big.
[chuckles]

53:03.267 --> 53:07.096
So, why didn'’t things
work out with your ex?

53:07.140 --> 53:09.795
[Astor]
Uh, fundamental life stuff.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.235
Francine?

53:16.280 --> 53:17.846
Yes?

53:17.890 --> 53:19.108
I love you.

53:19.152 --> 53:20.501
[chuckles]

53:20.545 --> 53:21.676
Where are you going?

53:23.069 --> 53:24.462
Yeah, I can'’t sleep over.

53:24.505 --> 53:26.420
-I mean... I mean...
-C'’mon.

53:26.464 --> 53:31.469
We just met, and, I have to
really get some sleep

53:31.512 --> 53:34.211
'’cause I have that new film
I'’m starting tomorrow, so...

53:34.254 --> 53:35.647
-OK.
-Mm-hm.

53:37.170 --> 53:39.041
Is that gonna be
difficult for you?

53:39.085 --> 53:40.608
Oh, working with him?

53:40.652 --> 53:45.265
Uh, I... yeah, imagine so...

53:45.309 --> 53:47.180
Is he gonna try to have
sex with you?

53:47.224 --> 53:49.138
[chuckles] Maybe.

53:49.182 --> 53:51.967
I kind of hope so, actually.

53:52.011 --> 53:54.840
I mean,
I'’m still in love with him, so.

53:58.626 --> 54:00.106
So, this is it?

54:01.063 --> 54:03.196
No!

54:03.240 --> 54:05.851
I... I think, like,
me and you could totally,

54:05.894 --> 54:09.507
just... we could be friends.

54:09.550 --> 54:12.553
Or, you... you could,
like, call me up in four months.

54:14.163 --> 54:15.208
[scoffs]

54:19.691 --> 54:21.258
I'’ll walk you out.

54:21.301 --> 54:22.563
[chuckles] Nah, I'’m all right.

54:22.607 --> 54:24.522
No, I want to. C'’mon.

54:24.565 --> 54:27.916
Um, I... I'’d actually really
prefer if you didn'’t.

54:27.960 --> 54:29.048
It'’s OK.

54:35.707 --> 54:37.752
I will... I'’ll see ya.

54:46.674 --> 54:50.025
[door opens, closes]

55:03.604 --> 55:05.127
[Lawrence]
I really appreciate that.

55:05.171 --> 55:06.955
That'’s great, let's...
let'’s talk soon.

55:08.479 --> 55:10.655
Hey, what'’s up?
Uh, shut the door.

55:13.222 --> 55:14.528
[door closes]

55:16.182 --> 55:17.531
How'’s it goin'?

55:19.403 --> 55:21.579
It'’s goin' OK, you know?
It'’s going fine.

55:21.622 --> 55:25.104
Um, it all works out,
you know, it always does.

55:26.714 --> 55:28.542
Unfortunately,
we didn'’t get the news

55:28.586 --> 55:30.152
that we were hoping for today.

55:30.196 --> 55:32.851
We still haven'’t closed
Taylor'’s contract.

55:32.894 --> 55:34.243
Are you serious?

55:34.287 --> 55:35.854
Yeah, but it'’s OK,
I mean, look,

55:35.897 --> 55:37.595
this is just a game
that reps like to play.

55:37.638 --> 55:40.119
It was exactly the same
on Adaline and Emily.

55:40.162 --> 55:44.036
If you remember,
we closed Ryan'’s deal
two days before we wrapped,

55:44.079 --> 55:45.646
yet he still showed up
every single day,

55:45.690 --> 55:47.300
he still shot your movie.
It wasn'’t a thing.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.476
No, you'’re right,
but these are teens,

55:49.520 --> 55:51.435
so, I need to know
that they'’re committed.

55:51.478 --> 55:54.133
They are committed. They'’re in.
I wouldn'’t worry about it.

55:54.176 --> 55:57.528
Mary, Taylor'’s manager,
just wants to have
one more call with you.

55:57.571 --> 55:59.747
-With me?
-With both of us.

55:59.791 --> 56:01.401
Well, is it creative?

56:01.445 --> 56:03.403
I don'’t know.
She didn'’t really say.

56:03.447 --> 56:06.101
Well, if it is, that'’s not
appropriate at this stage.

56:06.145 --> 56:08.321
Look, you'’re working on
a whole new level here.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.367
You have to play their game.

56:10.410 --> 56:13.108
Just make them feel like
this is a collaboration.

56:13.152 --> 56:14.762
-Which part?
-Everything.

56:14.806 --> 56:15.850
[chuckles]

56:17.896 --> 56:19.941
All right, let'’s, uh,
let'’s do the phone call.

56:19.985 --> 56:20.899
All right.

56:27.079 --> 56:29.560
[line trilling]

56:32.040 --> 56:33.868
I love talking to people.

56:35.479 --> 56:37.306
[man on phone] Mary Wexler'’s office.

56:37.350 --> 56:38.917
Hi, yes. Lawrence Hanson
and Astor Williams Stevenson

56:38.960 --> 56:40.571
for Mary, please.

56:40.614 --> 56:42.268
Just a moment.

56:44.096 --> 56:46.533
-[Mary] Lawrence.
-Hey, Mary, how'’s it goin'?

56:46.577 --> 56:49.188
Um, I'’m here with Astor
Williams Stevenson,
our director,

56:49.231 --> 56:50.581
if this is a good time for you?

56:50.624 --> 56:53.932
Hey, Mary, it'’s Astor.

56:53.975 --> 56:57.414
I just want to say
that Taylor is doing amazing.

56:57.457 --> 56:59.546
She is so excited.

56:59.590 --> 57:02.810
Um, and, I just know the movie
is going be amazing with her.

57:02.854 --> 57:05.160
We'’re so excited to have her.

57:05.204 --> 57:06.988
Thank you. She'’s very excited.

57:07.032 --> 57:08.729
I'’ll make this quick.

57:08.773 --> 57:11.297
This thong-underwear slash topless thing

57:11.340 --> 57:13.342
isn'’t going to happen.

57:17.042 --> 57:21.829
Um, Mary, just so we'’re clear,
you mean the pool scene, right?

57:21.873 --> 57:24.876
Not the sex scene?
Because, Astor, as requested,

57:24.919 --> 57:27.008
has already removed all
nudity from the sex scene

57:27.052 --> 57:29.271
on account of Taylor
being a minor.

57:29.315 --> 57:32.449
Correct, we'’re talking about the pool scene.

57:34.276 --> 57:37.062
Um, OK, so, Mary,
just for clarification,

57:37.105 --> 57:39.064
um, I don'’t know
if you'’ve read that,

57:39.107 --> 57:41.109
but that'’s a completely
non-sexual scene,

57:41.153 --> 57:44.025
that the state attorney general
has signed off per your request,

57:44.069 --> 57:49.074
and it went to you
and her parents for approval

57:49.117 --> 57:53.861
before it
ever went to her, so...

57:53.905 --> 57:55.602
All I'’m saying is,
we were pretty committed,

57:55.646 --> 57:57.256
from the beginning,
to working with people

57:57.299 --> 57:58.649
that this wouldn'’t be
a problem for.

58:00.912 --> 58:02.696
We'’re committed.

58:02.740 --> 58:05.394
It'’s just the thong and toplessness.

58:05.438 --> 58:08.833
We sent over alternative underwear, did you see those?

58:12.053 --> 58:13.098
Standby.

58:22.716 --> 58:24.979
OK, um, Mary?

58:25.023 --> 58:28.113
Uh, I'’m just
seeing this now...
This is, uh...

58:29.418 --> 58:31.116
A...

58:31.159 --> 58:34.032
I guess these are
work out shorts?

58:34.075 --> 58:35.729
Uh, and a sports bra?

58:35.773 --> 58:36.730
You know...

58:39.254 --> 58:40.865
I'’m trying to imply
that the character

58:40.908 --> 58:43.041
is sexually loose
because of a deep insecurity

58:43.084 --> 58:45.173
not that she is in a yoga class.

58:51.310 --> 58:54.922
We could also explore,
like, head replacement
and a body double.

58:58.230 --> 59:00.841
I'’ll have to get back to you on that.

59:00.885 --> 59:04.062
So, let'’s move on to the second concern.

59:04.105 --> 59:07.195
The spanking scene on page three.

59:07.239 --> 59:09.763
How exactly are you planning on shooting that?

59:12.505 --> 59:14.072
What do you mean?
The angle?

59:14.115 --> 59:16.074
Because, it'’s from the side.

59:16.117 --> 59:19.643
There... there'’s, so there's
no actual, literal nudity there.

59:19.686 --> 59:23.603
We can see that in the script. I mean, in terms of the act.

59:23.647 --> 59:27.520
Are you actually planning on having a grown man spank Taylor?

59:29.261 --> 59:31.219
It'’s a...
It'’s a very low angle shot,

59:31.263 --> 59:33.091
so it doesn'’t matter to me
who spanks her.

59:33.134 --> 59:34.875
It could be her best friend,

59:34.919 --> 59:37.312
or whomever makes her
feel most comfortable.

59:39.184 --> 59:41.534
So, you'’re planning on actually filming that?

59:43.667 --> 59:46.321
Uh, yeah, listen, Mary,
if it'’s in the script,

59:46.365 --> 59:49.847
I'’m planning on filming it.
Which is why it'’s in the script.

59:49.890 --> 59:53.285
Um, otherwise,
I wouldn'’t put it in the script.

59:56.157 --> 59:59.900
All right, well, I'’m going to circle back with her agent

59:59.944 --> 01:00:02.773
and we'’ll be back in touch. Thank you.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.783
That did not go well.

01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:14.828
Uh, yeah, what did
you want me to say then?

01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:17.352
Because, I'’m not the one
changing things.

01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:20.965
That went to her for approval
way before it ever went
to her client.

01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:23.010
You know, you just have to play
their game a little bit.

01:00:23.054 --> 01:00:24.969
What would you like me to say?
You want me to ask her

01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:26.623
to come down here
and co-direct with me?

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:28.973
Look... I'’ll call her.

01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:31.540
I'’ll work it out.
It'’ll all be fine.

01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:34.108
Just me and her.
But you gotta get it together.

01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:36.023
This is part of your job.

01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:38.504
This is not the last time
this is gonna come up,

01:00:38.547 --> 01:00:40.549
so, you better
learn to handle it.

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:44.249
All right.

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:09.622
[line trilling]

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.585
[Mom] Hey, honey.

01:01:16.629 --> 01:01:17.543
Hey, Mom.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:19.980
How'’s the movie going?

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:21.678
It'’s going all right.

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:23.331
You know, your father has some ideas

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.855
about your story.

01:01:24.898 --> 01:01:26.595
[sighs]

01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:28.510
-You should listen to him.-I don'’t want to.

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:30.817
He'’s really good at that kinda thing.

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.776
He'’s a very talented artist.

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.560
No, he'’s not, Mom.

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.737
He'’s not good at anything.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:41.523
He'’s a delusional failure.
He'’s a failed artist.

01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:44.701
Show me any art
that he'’s producing.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:48.966
Show me where it is.
You can'’t.

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:52.099
He'’d literally be homeless
if it weren'’t for
the first half of his life

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:54.885
being supported by his father
and now, I guess,

01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:57.626
the second half of his life
now being supported by you.

01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:03.110
I guess you have to think this,
or whatever,

01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:05.156
to support what you'’re doing,
but don'’t put it on me.

01:02:05.199 --> 01:02:08.376
Don'’t make me
have to feel that way.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.988
I can'’t be around him,
because you guys all pretend

01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:15.122
like he'’s supporting himself
from God knows what.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:17.211
But, meanwhile,
I'’m actually out there

01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.300
busting my ass
trying to not be him.

01:02:19.344 --> 01:02:22.521
If I were him
I'’d literally rather die.

01:02:26.307 --> 01:02:29.963
Fucking delusional
failed narcissist.

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.489
It'’s OK.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.404
[sighs]

01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:42.846
I'’m sorry I upset you.

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:45.587
It'’s OK.

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:50.636
[softly]
I'’ll talk to you later.

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:19.186
So, um, my sister is
coming into town tomorrow,

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.449
and then I am starting
my new movie.

01:03:21.493 --> 01:03:24.539
So, I may not see you
for a little while.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:26.585
That'’s OK.

01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:27.629
I get it.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:30.981
Thanks.

01:03:36.682 --> 01:03:37.814
[laughs]

01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:39.293
Sorry.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:41.165
No, I liked it.

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:51.610
Have you ever had an abortion?

01:03:58.225 --> 01:04:01.446
I'’m sorry, it was, uh, a really,
uh, stupid thing to say.

01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:02.839
-I just asked--
-It'’s OK.

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.231
I shouldn'’t have.

01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:06.059
I just haven'’t talked about it

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:08.366
with anyone before, so...

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:09.758
Even my best friend
doesn'’t know.

01:04:11.804 --> 01:04:13.023
How '’bout your mom?

01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:14.328
-[chuckles]
-She must know?

01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:15.721
No.

01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:19.943
You wanna talk about it?

01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:22.815
No.

01:04:29.256 --> 01:04:31.955
You just went to Planned
Parenthood by yourself, or...?

01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:37.134
No, my high school
boyfriend drove me.

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.879
He waited in the lobby with me,

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:46.839
but... [chuckles]
he left because he got scared.

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:51.975
There were people literally,
like, protesting outside.

01:04:57.806 --> 01:04:59.156
I'’m sorry.

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:00.853
[sniffling]

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:07.207
It'’s nothing.
I'’m... I'm just being stupid.

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.560
No, you'’re not.

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:22.309
[moaning]

01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:47.552
[moaning continues]

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:16.885
Hi!

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:19.976
Hey, you look great.
[chuckles]

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.890
Yes, you can put your
things there, if you'’d like.

01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:23.631
How long have you been
writing it for?

01:06:25.024 --> 01:06:27.722
Uh, two years, or so.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.682
So, you want this day bed?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.553
Because you can sleep here
if you'’d like,

01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:33.815
but you can also have my bed.

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:35.513
No. No, I like... I like this.

01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:38.951
OK, good.
If you get hungry then,

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.302
there is three months
of freeze-dried food under here

01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:44.913
-and some shotgun shells.
-Oh.

01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:47.177
-So, you can fully
defend yourself.
-Oh, great.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:48.743
Yeah, is that...

01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:51.137
Preparing for the apocalypse,
are we?

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:53.444
Uh... [sighs]
It'’s complicated.

01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:55.576
[chuckles]

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.231
-Hey, have you talked to Mom,
or Dad recently?
-Yeah.

01:06:58.275 --> 01:07:00.320
I talked to her yesterday
and she did not say
you were coming,

01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:04.107
which I thought was odd,
and you know I don'’t
talk to Dad, so...

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.979
Well, I didn'’t tell her
I was coming,

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:10.200
because I haven'’t been
talking to her much.

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:11.592
OK.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.728
So, what do you want for dinner?

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.817
Uh, anything.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:24.475
Please, tell me,
are you still a vegetarian?

01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:28.261
-No.
-Ahh!

01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:30.394
-Nope, not anymore.
-All right, OK.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.881
I really like Valerie.

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:41.013
Thanks.

01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:47.063
Well, she'’s sweet
and she'’s really nice to me.

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:50.370
Thanks.
Why would you say that?

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:53.199
Well, because, you said
that it'’s maybe not over,

01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:58.074
so I... I think that you
can get her back.

01:07:58.117 --> 01:08:00.293
[groans]
Why do you like her?

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.558
She'’s just so real, you know?

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:07.866
Like, when she and her sister
came to visit me in New York?

01:08:07.909 --> 01:08:10.129
They were so together.

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:14.481
Like, they'’re pretty
and cool, and it'’s like
they'’re not even trying,

01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:17.005
it'’s just the way they are,
you know?

01:08:17.049 --> 01:08:18.703
It'’s like they're real artists.

01:08:18.746 --> 01:08:20.357
You married a Muslim
and it didn'’t work out.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.314
You should understand
where I'’m coming from.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:24.361
Hey, that'’s not fair!

01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:27.973
Mohammad and I did not separate
because of religion.

01:08:28.015 --> 01:08:31.281
It was way more
complicated than that.

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:33.152
Do you still talk to him?

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:35.589
He'’s my best friend.

01:08:35.633 --> 01:08:39.202
Her whole family
were Scientologists.

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:41.073
Well, have you even
looked into it?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.073
No.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.424
Yes and no.

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:46.339
He'’s still your best friend?

01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:47.906
We were talking about
having a baby.

01:08:47.948 --> 01:08:51.562
What?
Madeline, you can'’t do that.

01:08:51.604 --> 01:08:53.216
It didn'’t work out.
You gotta move on.

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:54.478
You should be dating.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.089
I... I have been dating...

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.178
and the guys are worse.

01:08:59.221 --> 01:09:00.701
-Don'’t say that.
-Why?

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:04.488
I wanna have kids
and he'’s kind to me.

01:09:04.531 --> 01:09:07.229
You don'’t know
what it'’s like in New York.

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:11.363
Like, everyone is
so self-obsessed.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:15.499
They'’re all holding out
for this dream of something.

01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:18.457
And then... and then time
just keeps passing, and...

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.636
You know, I know these people.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.639
They'’re all rock stars
at their jobs,

01:09:25.683 --> 01:09:28.729
and then they just end up
getting old

01:09:28.773 --> 01:09:30.644
and staying forlorn and...

01:09:30.688 --> 01:09:33.081
and then when they
finally realize it,

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:34.734
and they try and, you know,

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.737
find whoever'’s left
to have kids with

01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:39.479
it... it'’s too late.

01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:43.265
And then they'’re...

01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:45.398
and then they'’re
really just alone.

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:47.879
Like, forever.

01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:50.881
-Jesus.
-Now, I don'’t want that,

01:09:50.925 --> 01:09:52.622
not for you either.

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:01.632
Yeah, maybe I shoulda
fought harder for Jackie.

01:10:01.675 --> 01:10:04.983
No. No, she wasn'’t nice.
I didn'’t like her as much.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.681
Well, that'’s the thing.

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:09.335
We kind of were the same
so it worked.

01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:11.859
-I'’m not very nice either.
-You are though.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:19.171
I... I threw a beer on her
at Tribeca, in public.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.173
[both laughing]

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:24.394
Well, she probably deserved it.

01:10:24.437 --> 01:10:27.832
Yeah, didn'’t she leave you
just when her TV show

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:30.226
got picked up
and she made some money?

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:32.010
You didn'’t know her that well.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:36.580
It'’s... It was complicated.

01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:39.626
It doesn'’t seem like it.

01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:49.680
Hey, you remember when you came
and visited me in New York last?

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:51.464
Yeah.

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.555
Where did you go
when you didn'’t come home?

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.781
I don'’t think I can say.

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:04.956
Please?

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.915
I think I need to know.

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:01.534
[line trilling]

01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:06.191
[woman] Hello?

01:12:06.234 --> 01:12:07.975
Hey, Jackie.

01:12:08.846 --> 01:12:09.934
Hey.

01:12:09.977 --> 01:12:11.457
Do you have a second?

01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.112
What'’s up?

01:12:14.155 --> 01:12:15.809
-It'’s been a long time.-Um...

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:26.080
I guess...
I'’m calling to apologize.

01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:28.213
OK.

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:37.222
Things didn'’t work out
with Valerie.

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:39.529
Mm-hm.

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:41.966
And...

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:50.801
I guess I'’m getting
to the stage where I see it
as a recurring pattern?

01:12:50.844 --> 01:12:54.805
-Mm-hm.-And... was wondering

01:12:54.848 --> 01:12:57.416
if maybe you would
have some advice for me,

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:01.028
having been somebody
who was with me for so long.

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:03.204
I am so glad you asked me that.

01:13:03.248 --> 01:13:05.119
It really means a lot that you'’re facing this

01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:06.512
head on for the first time.

01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:10.734
I mean... offhand?

01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:15.042
I can say you had some jealousy issues, for sure.

01:13:15.086 --> 01:13:17.436
But then I wasn'’t really into it,

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.092
so, maybe that was founded.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:24.225
You know, Ryan and I went through some real trust issues

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:30.231

Are you all right?

01:15:36.488 --> 01:15:38.708
Why are you here, Astor?

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.666
Because you invited me?

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:42.581
A month ago, when things
were a bit different.

01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:44.931
Why would you be playing
"Madama Butterfly" at a party

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:46.890
I'’m not invited to?
It'’s my favorite opera.

01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:48.892
Uh, I like it?

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:51.372
Your sister hadn'’t even heard
of it until I played it for her.

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.940
Which has to be the same for you
because you two share
the same goddamn brain.

01:15:53.984 --> 01:15:56.943
Right, well, I practically live
in Switzerland at this point.

01:15:56.987 --> 01:15:59.380
Because of Basel?

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:00.468
This is Italian.

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:02.122
I find it romantic.

01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:04.255
[chuckles] It'’s about
imperialistic brutalism.

01:16:04.298 --> 01:16:07.737
It'’s literally the story of
an officer who leaves his wife

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:11.523
and steals their child
because she isn'’t white,
and she kills herself.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.003
Well,
doesn'’t that sound familiar?

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:14.613
No wonder
it'’s your favorite opera.

01:16:14.657 --> 01:16:16.789
Racial bigotry,
religious bigotry.

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.966
And by the way, Brutalism is
a form of 1950'’s architecture,

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:21.707
you quasi-elitist prick.

01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:23.840
And you don'’t need to tell us
that Taylor Touring

01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:26.059
is in your movie,
because we don'’t give a fuck!

01:16:33.066 --> 01:16:34.981
You guys are all in a cult.

01:16:35.025 --> 01:16:36.983
Maybe some of you don'’t
know that,

01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:39.638
but if you'’re unaware,
you'’re all slowly being

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:43.947
sucked into a pseudo-spiritual
global pyramid scheme.

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:46.950
And just for the record,
I'’m not for sale.

01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:49.474
Why do you keep
doing this to me?

01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:52.216
You say you wanna be with me
and that'’s what you think?

I'’ve never spoken to Jim before,

from the film.

Effective immediately.

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:25.543
It is, um... non-negotiable.

01:19:27.284 --> 01:19:30.635
There'’s nothing that we can do
to change this.

He is very sorry, but...

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:37.729
it is the final decision.

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:50.873
Did...

01:19:53.179 --> 01:19:54.833
Did you ask why?

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:58.445
I did.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.580
Do you wanna know why?

01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:03.973
Of course.

01:20:05.409 --> 01:20:09.935
They have lost trust in you

01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:14.897
as a filmmaker and also, um,

01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.292
she no longer feels
safe with you.

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:33.916
Do you think
she actually said that?

01:20:35.004 --> 01:20:36.309
I don'’t know, man.

01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:40.139

01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:46.406
How can they say that?

We'’re ten days
away from shooting

01:20:48.147 --> 01:20:49.888

01:20:50.758 --> 01:20:51.934
Look.

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:54.371
We will make this film.

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.329
We will, I promise you.

01:20:58.331 --> 01:21:03.902
It'’s just not gonna be now, um,

01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:07.601
-and it'’s not gonna be with her.
-We can recast it?

01:21:07.645 --> 01:21:09.777

you'’re not on the phone
doing something about this.

On the phone with who?

01:21:22.312 --> 01:21:25.358
All of our financing
is tied to her.

01:21:25.402 --> 01:21:31.799
There is nobody that we can
recast that will satisfy
the financier'’s terms.

01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:34.715
She'’s not some 40-year-old guy.

01:21:34.759 --> 01:21:36.979
She'’s a teenage girl.

01:21:37.022 --> 01:21:39.068
There is only one of her.

01:21:42.723 --> 01:21:46.989
Um, I'’m very sorry, but...

-All right.

in the eye when you cheers.

not to wear panties.

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:02.211
I'’m disappointed.

01:24:02.254 --> 01:24:03.734
Go to the bathroom,

01:24:03.777 --> 01:24:05.910
take them off,
and come back out here.

01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:09.000
[chuckles]

01:24:26.844 --> 01:24:28.802
Good. Now go over there.

01:24:28.846 --> 01:24:29.890
Stand over there.

01:24:34.634 --> 01:24:37.289
Turn around
and pull up your skirt.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.557
Good.

01:24:48.735 --> 01:24:50.302
[giggles]

01:24:50.346 --> 01:24:52.913
Now, put my cock...
in your mouth.

01:24:55.002 --> 01:24:57.309
[moaning]

01:25:02.662 --> 01:25:03.968
Oh, yeah.

01:25:05.883 --> 01:25:07.798
[moaning]

01:25:10.148 --> 01:25:11.497
Oh, yeah. I'’m gonna cum.

01:25:16.894 --> 01:25:18.287
-[moans]
-[gags]

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:38.524
You want some water?

01:25:42.572 --> 01:25:43.834
You want some water?

01:25:44.835 --> 01:25:46.053
Sure.

01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:55.672
Here.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:57.064
Thanks.

01:26:06.552 --> 01:26:07.684
[giggling]

01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:11.818
What'’s going on?

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:14.952
Oh, nothing.

01:26:19.609 --> 01:26:20.653
C'’mon.

01:26:22.786 --> 01:26:25.049
[giggling]

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:26.181
C'’mon.

01:26:27.791 --> 01:26:29.271
Nothing.

01:26:34.928 --> 01:26:37.496
C'’mon, I feel like
we just always have
these surface interactions.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.803
You can tell me
what'’s going on with you.

01:26:39.846 --> 01:26:42.197
I like to know sometimes,
you know?

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.416
It'’s nothing.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.722
[laughing]

01:26:49.987 --> 01:26:51.075
C'’mon.

01:27:01.085 --> 01:27:02.042
I just...

01:27:04.262 --> 01:27:06.525
I just really like you.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.225
Well, that'’s not so bad,
I like you, too.

01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:16.448
It'’s not the same.

01:27:17.362 --> 01:27:18.624
I get it.

01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:22.759
[sighs]
Shut up, I'’m being stupid.

01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:24.717
Let'’s have another drink.

01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:26.197
Not water.

01:27:27.372 --> 01:27:29.287
All right, but... c'’mon.

01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:32.290
Tell me what'’s going on.

01:27:32.334 --> 01:27:33.770
If you'’re not going to
be honest with me,

01:27:33.813 --> 01:27:35.424
I... I don'’t know what
the point of us

01:27:35.467 --> 01:27:37.339
pretending like we'’re having
a conversation is.

01:27:49.742 --> 01:27:50.830
I get it.

01:27:52.354 --> 01:27:53.790
You'’re busy.

01:27:55.313 --> 01:27:57.315
You have a lot going on and...

01:27:59.883 --> 01:28:01.493
You probably never
think about me, except,

01:28:01.537 --> 01:28:04.757
for like once a month
when we see each other.

01:28:05.715 --> 01:28:07.020
That'’s OK!

01:28:07.064 --> 01:28:09.196
I... I'’m not asking for more.

01:28:12.635 --> 01:28:16.116
That'’s not fair.
I don'’t think about you
just once a month.

01:28:19.032 --> 01:28:21.687
C'’mon, I'd see you more.
I'’ve just been really busy.

01:28:25.735 --> 01:28:30.348
Listen, you do
what you need to do.

01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:34.483
You wanna...
you wanna see other women,

01:28:34.526 --> 01:28:37.399
or, sleep with them,
or, whatever, it'’s fine!

01:28:37.442 --> 01:28:40.793
I mean, you don'’t even have to
keep it a secret from me.

01:28:40.837 --> 01:28:45.232
It could, like, be our thing
and I'’d be OK with it.

01:28:46.843 --> 01:28:49.759
Just as long
as you made time for me.

01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:53.284
Well, I don'’t know
what you'’re saying.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:55.678
We haven'’t really
had a talk or anything.

01:28:55.721 --> 01:28:58.333
I'’ve just...
I'’ve been busy working.

01:29:12.869 --> 01:29:14.436
I think about you a lot.

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:20.267
Like, every day.

01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:23.183
Like, every hour.

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:25.795
I mean, I do a lot of things,
and when I'’m doing these things,

01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:27.274
I think about you.

01:29:28.493 --> 01:29:30.365
But, I don'’t tell you,

01:29:30.408 --> 01:29:33.193
because I know it'’s not
the same for you.

01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:35.892
Well, that'’s not fair.

01:29:35.935 --> 01:29:37.894
You really don'’t
know me very well.

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:40.418
I know you.

01:29:44.117 --> 01:29:45.945
[sighs]

01:29:47.251 --> 01:29:49.471
You... you really don'’t.

01:29:49.514 --> 01:29:53.866
I... I am not, uh...

01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:01.483
This... this is like a half me.

01:30:01.526 --> 01:30:04.573
You... you haven'’t
even met a real me.

01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:06.662
I'’m in...

01:30:11.536 --> 01:30:13.712
Trust me, this guy you'’ve met?

01:30:13.756 --> 01:30:15.453
Uh, you don'’t wanna
be with this.

01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:17.847
The timing... the timing is off.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.982
I know what you are.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.725
I like this half you!

01:30:26.769 --> 01:30:28.684
It'’s... it's a part of you.

01:30:28.727 --> 01:30:31.251
You'’re like... you're an artist
and you'’re going for it

01:30:31.295 --> 01:30:33.166
and that means the world to me!

01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:34.864
I mean, I know what'’s
important to you.

01:30:34.907 --> 01:30:39.434
I went to art school,
but now I'’m selling BMWs

01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:41.523
because I got scared.

01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:44.395
Everyone gets scared,
but you'’re not.

01:30:50.575 --> 01:30:52.359
We can'’t see each other anymore.

01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:54.492
Forget what I said.

01:30:54.536 --> 01:30:56.929
-It'’s not that.
-You know, I could support you?

01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:58.931
And... just for a little bit.

01:30:58.975 --> 01:31:01.891
Just until
you made it really big,
and it'’d make me happy.

01:31:01.934 --> 01:31:03.980
I... I'’d gladly do it.

01:31:15.557 --> 01:31:16.601
Just...

01:31:22.128 --> 01:31:24.391
-Uh...
-Forget what I said.

01:31:39.406 --> 01:31:41.931
I will never make you happy.

01:31:46.152 --> 01:31:50.200
You think we have
a deep connection, but we don'’t.
[chuckles]

01:31:50.243 --> 01:31:53.508
You'’re just something
I call up late at night
when I want to have a good time

01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:56.423
because you look different
from most women I'’ve slept with.

01:31:58.817 --> 01:32:01.516
And you have some propensity
for pleasing me

01:32:01.559 --> 01:32:04.519
that far exceeds
my pornographic desires.

01:32:08.827 --> 01:32:09.872
That'’s it.

01:32:21.623 --> 01:32:25.583
You don'’t get to talk to me
like a child.

01:32:26.758 --> 01:32:27.846
I know what you are.

01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:29.587
I know what I am to you.

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.243
You made me say these things,

01:32:33.286 --> 01:32:36.420
I mean, we can just have fun.

01:32:41.338 --> 01:32:44.384
You are 29 years old.

01:32:46.256 --> 01:32:49.041
You come from
a traditional Korean family

01:32:49.085 --> 01:32:51.087
who wants you to marry
a nice guy

01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:53.219
and you'’re gonna get married.

01:32:53.263 --> 01:32:55.526
You'’re at your absolute prime
right now, both physically,

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.702
and in terms of anything
that'’s deemed not going down.

01:32:57.746 --> 01:33:01.706
So, I'’m literally
wasting your best asset away.

01:33:03.882 --> 01:33:06.537
Right now is when you
need to find a nice guy,

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:08.408
who'’s a little dumber than you,

01:33:08.452 --> 01:33:10.062
who'’s gonna worship you
the rest of your life.

01:33:10.106 --> 01:33:12.021
Not ten years from now.

01:33:12.064 --> 01:33:14.023
Because now you can still
find something

01:33:14.066 --> 01:33:16.547
that'’s pretty fucking good.
But ten years from now?

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.549
You'’re not gonna get shit.

01:33:28.167 --> 01:33:30.430
Fuck... Fuck you!

01:33:30.474 --> 01:33:32.998
You don'’t get to tell me
what I want.

01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:34.652
Fuck you!

01:33:34.696 --> 01:33:36.219
I know what I want.

01:33:40.397 --> 01:33:42.617
I'’ve had nothing
but love for you.

01:35:29.636 --> 01:35:31.987
[panting]
