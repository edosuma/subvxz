<i>Maddie is shooting a movie, but</i>
<i>I have next best thing: Brynn.</i>

00:06.780 --> 00:08.818
ASHLEE:
<i>What I would ask is that</i>

00:08.818 --> 00:11.590
I and Brynn get the same respect
that you guys ask from me.

00:11.590 --> 00:13.493
(bleep) you.

ABBY LEE: <i>The minis are gonna</i>

<i>She's so checked out.</i>

00:19.640 --> 00:21.644
I'm finished.

00:24.950 --> 00:27.221
I'm not coming back
with the kids.

00:27.221 --> 00:28.490
ASHLEE: <i>Losing Maddie</i>
<i>and Mackenzie has got to be</i>

00:28.490 --> 00:29.693
<i>the closest thing for Abby</i>

00:29.693 --> 00:30.695
to losing her own children.

Abby, are you okay?

How was your break?

00:52.505 --> 00:53.808
NIA:
It was awesome.

00:53.808 --> 00:54.810
I‐I was so busy.

00:54.810 --> 00:56.880
I mean, I was only home

00:56.880 --> 00:58.083
for, like, a week. (laughs)

00:58.083 --> 00:59.753
That's good.
JESSALYNN: <i>It feels so good</i>

00:59.753 --> 01:01.122

01:01.122 --> 01:02.291
<i>Like, I love L. A.</i>

01:02.291 --> 01:04.061
<i>I love our team, but</i>

01:04.061 --> 01:07.769

Do you want
to say anything before

they walk out
the door, Abby?

01:14.248 --> 01:15.952
ABBY LEE:
I don't really have

01:15.952 --> 01:16.920
final words.

01:18.390 --> 01:19.660
Where you going?

01:20.628 --> 01:21.797
HOLLY:
It's the last time

01:21.797 --> 01:23.199
they're walking out the door.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.168
That was it.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.070
ASHLEE:
It definitely feels like

01:25.070 --> 01:26.239
we're missing...
Yeah. I know.

01:26.239 --> 01:27.876
a lot of people though.
NIA:
So empty.

01:27.876 --> 01:29.880
It does. It feels different.
Well, Jill and Kendall

01:29.880 --> 01:31.249
aren't here.
Yeah. They'll be here soon.

01:31.249 --> 01:32.585
Well, that's true.
JOJO: When's Kendall coming?

01:32.585 --> 01:34.088
HOLLY:
I think sometime today.

01:34.088 --> 01:36.426
It's weird though
without Maddie right here

01:36.426 --> 01:37.696
and Kenzie right there.
NIA: And Kenzie.

01:37.696 --> 01:39.265
KALANI:
Yeah, it's kind of weird.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.935
That's true.
JOJO: It's, like, not...

01:40.935 --> 01:43.273
It's, like, different.
It's just different.

01:43.273 --> 01:44.509
JESSALYNN: Yeah.
I mean, change is not bad.

01:44.509 --> 01:46.312
KALANI:
This could be a great thing,

01:46.312 --> 01:48.416
but I don't know if Abby
will make it a great thing.

01:48.416 --> 01:50.187
You know she always has
something up her sleeve,

01:50.187 --> 01:51.422
so something is coming.

01:51.422 --> 01:52.559
HOLLY:
<i>I really hope that</i>

01:52.559 --> 01:53.894
Abby sees the potential

01:53.894 --> 01:57.502
<i>of the elite competition team</i>
<i>that remains.</i>

01:57.502 --> 01:59.305
They have so much to offer.

01:59.305 --> 02:02.111
<i>And I think, for years,</i>
<i>they have been overlooked.</i>

02:02.111 --> 02:03.046
And I just hope now

02:03.046 --> 02:04.783
<i>the spotlight can be</i>

02:04.783 --> 02:06.352
<i>on each and every one of them.</i>

02:06.352 --> 02:08.189
ASHLEE:
So Jill isn't here.

02:08.189 --> 02:09.659
She's not mourning

02:09.659 --> 02:12.030
the fact that Melissa is not
coming back with her?

02:12.030 --> 02:13.601
JESSALYNN:
It's gonna be good for her.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.370
Maybe she'll be less crazy.

02:15.370 --> 02:17.040
Maybe you two will get along.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.247
ASHLEE: I felt like the week
that we left, I felt like things

02:20.247 --> 02:22.952
were kind of smoothed over
with her.

02:22.952 --> 02:25.858
And then I did see
a bunch of things

02:25.858 --> 02:28.531
on social media, kind of
rude things that she wrote.

02:28.531 --> 02:29.933
And even Kira wrote some.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.837
ASHLEE:
<i>During the break, I was</i>

02:31.837 --> 02:35.076
the target of some pretty
malicious social media comments.

02:35.076 --> 02:38.517
<i>Jill and Kira were largely</i>
<i>fueling the fire</i>

02:38.517 --> 02:41.355
by continuing to write
negative things, which is:

02:41.355 --> 02:45.197
<i>I'm a horrible person,</i>
<i>we should just go home.</i>

02:45.197 --> 02:46.633
She thinks I'm
a horrible person.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.002
She said I'm a horrible...
KIRA: Yeah, you are

02:48.002 --> 02:50.340
a horrible person
when you come in here.

02:50.340 --> 02:51.810
You're trying to fight
for your way

02:51.810 --> 02:53.079
for your daughter to get ahead,

02:53.079 --> 02:54.415
and that's fine,
and if that's

02:54.415 --> 02:55.785
what you want to be,
that's what you want to be.

02:55.785 --> 02:57.254
ABBY LEE:
Hello, everybody.

02:57.254 --> 02:58.423
How are you?
Hello!

02:58.423 --> 02:59.659
It's good to see you.
Good to see you.

02:59.659 --> 03:00.995
Good to see you.
Good to be back.

03:00.995 --> 03:02.765
HOLLY:
Yes.
ASHLEE:
<i>What Kira is not</i>

03:02.765 --> 03:04.736
smart enough to realize is that

03:04.736 --> 03:07.809
<i>when she posts negative crap,</i>
<i>she's feeding this monster,</i>

03:07.809 --> 03:09.411
and it hurts everybody's image.

03:09.411 --> 03:11.048
<i>I thought</i>
<i>we were done with this.</i>

03:12.952 --> 03:14.388
Uh, girls,

03:14.388 --> 03:15.524
get in line.

03:15.524 --> 03:17.528
I hope everyone's
eager to get back.

03:17.528 --> 03:19.031
The break has been long,

03:19.031 --> 03:20.935
and, uh, I know when...

03:20.935 --> 03:23.072
(girls chattering excitedly)

03:23.072 --> 03:25.076
HOLLY:
(whoops) Oh!

03:25.076 --> 03:27.047
Good.

03:27.047 --> 03:28.918
Hi.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.554
Yay.
JILL: Hello.

03:30.554 --> 03:31.757
Sorry we're late.
Sorry we're late.

03:31.757 --> 03:33.994
How are you?
Good to see you.

03:33.994 --> 03:35.230
JILL:
Everybody's here.

03:35.230 --> 03:36.900
Okay, we had to get

03:36.900 --> 03:38.136
on a plane this morning.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.471
We had some stuff in Pittsburgh

03:39.471 --> 03:41.610
that it was mandatory
we be there for,

03:41.610 --> 03:43.514
so here we are. Yeah.
Okay.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.952
ABBY LEE:
Before we get into where we're
going and what we're doing,

03:45.952 --> 03:48.489
I just want to mention
there's five of you.

03:48.489 --> 03:52.164
An integral part of
this team is not here.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.540
But the show must
go on, right?

03:56.540 --> 03:59.813
I would say, "You know what?
Hey, that kid's out of the way.

03:59.813 --> 04:02.417
That could be me."

04:02.417 --> 04:05.457
If you want
that star status,

04:05.457 --> 04:08.162
due diligence here,
and it will happen.

04:08.162 --> 04:10.433
This season, things are
going to be different.

04:10.433 --> 04:13.674
<i>There's no Maddie in front</i>
<i>of you for you to hide behind.</i>

04:13.674 --> 04:16.012
I'm gonna push you,
and I'm gonna challenge you

04:16.012 --> 04:18.149
until you are the performer
that I think you could be.

04:18.149 --> 04:19.619
<i>It's all about</i>

04:19.619 --> 04:20.721
new beginnings.

04:20.721 --> 04:22.625
ASHLEE: You know,
on the way in this morning,

04:22.625 --> 04:24.194
all the girls‐‐ I think

04:24.194 --> 04:26.432
they were really hoping
that they were gonna

04:26.432 --> 04:28.504
get a chance to do some things
they hadn't been able

04:28.504 --> 04:30.006
to do before,
with Maddie not being here.

04:30.006 --> 04:31.475
Absolutely.

04:31.475 --> 04:33.479
I want them all
to be stars

04:33.479 --> 04:35.718
in their own right, so
I want to be involved

04:35.718 --> 04:37.955
in your kids' lives,
but I feel like

04:37.955 --> 04:40.460
a lot of times
over the years,

04:40.460 --> 04:42.598
that's gone by the wayside,

04:42.598 --> 04:44.368
and I'm just
making do.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.403
I don't want to make do.

04:45.403 --> 04:48.877
So I'm gonna
do my best.

04:48.877 --> 04:50.514
<i>Change can be good.</i>

04:50.514 --> 04:52.417
It can push you
in a new direction.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.856
<i>We all need</i>
<i>to elevate our game.</i>

04:54.856 --> 04:57.562
<i>I'm all in,</i>
<i>but will the girls be?</i>

04:57.562 --> 04:59.098
<i>That's the real question.</i>

04:59.098 --> 05:01.536
Let's make up our minds
to do better dancing.

05:01.536 --> 05:04.241
You need to get out on
that stage and perform.

05:04.241 --> 05:06.045
No holds barred.

05:06.045 --> 05:08.750
Keep striving,
and let's do it all.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.621
HOLLY:
<i>Like, where did she come from?</i>

05:10.621 --> 05:13.192
<i>She's, like,</i>
<i>an imposter, because</i>

05:13.192 --> 05:14.896
this woman's about work.

05:14.896 --> 05:17.000
This woman's about
"I don't want to get involved."

05:17.000 --> 05:19.939
<i>But how long can this last?</i>
<i>You talk about new beginning.</i>

05:19.939 --> 05:22.778
Um, I don't even know
what to make of this,

05:22.778 --> 05:25.316
<i>because this is not</i>
<i>what I'm used to.</i>

05:25.316 --> 05:27.788
ABBY LEE: Okay, I need to
get to the pyramid. Yes?

05:27.788 --> 05:29.291
Okay.
Bah‐bah.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.528
Kalani.

05:30.528 --> 05:31.730
Oh!
What did I do?

05:31.730 --> 05:34.134
Last season, you were
in the group dance.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.472
<i>You were fine.</i>
<i>I always want more from you.</i>

05:36.472 --> 05:40.146
<i>I want you to not rely</i>
<i>on pretty.</i>

05:40.146 --> 05:41.081
Understand?

05:42.785 --> 05:44.454
Next we have JoJo.

05:44.454 --> 05:45.791
I thought

05:45.791 --> 05:46.993
you were great
in the group dance.

05:46.993 --> 05:48.029

Nia, I know you were busy
during our time off.

05:57.715 --> 06:00.688
Tell everybody what
you did. Proceed.

06:00.688 --> 06:03.694
So, during the break,
I did a lot of stuff.

06:03.694 --> 06:06.700
You were there for this at the
<i>High Strung</i> movie premiere.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.969
Yes.

06:07.969 --> 06:10.273

06:23.232 --> 06:24.836
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

06:24.836 --> 06:27.274
Beyoncé posted it

06:27.274 --> 06:29.712
on her Facebook,
and it says "Nia Sioux"

06:29.712 --> 06:30.981
across the top of it.

06:30.981 --> 06:33.920
And it should say
"Nia Sioux... ALDC."

06:33.920 --> 06:36.292
(laughter)
But, Nia, I went.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.296
I watched your performance.
I was thrilled.

06:38.296 --> 06:40.601
You performed

06:40.601 --> 06:41.803
like a real pro out there.

06:41.803 --> 06:43.439
It was great.
Thank you.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.445
Kendall.

06:46.445 --> 06:48.583
In the group dance,
you did a good job.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.420
<i>I didn't feel</i>
<i>that you were a follower.</i>

06:50.420 --> 06:52.223
<i>I felt that</i>
<i>you were more of leader.</i>

06:52.223 --> 06:53.459
<i>I just want you</i>

06:53.459 --> 06:55.664
to be more in the moment.

06:55.664 --> 06:59.037
And I talk about that
when it comes to acting.

06:59.037 --> 07:01.743
Next... we have Brynn.

07:01.743 --> 07:04.515
(cheering)
Brynn, you went
away with me.

07:04.515 --> 07:05.851
You were a pleasure

07:05.851 --> 07:08.590
to have along, and I learned

07:08.590 --> 07:09.759
a little bit about you,

07:09.759 --> 07:11.963
and I know more what
you need to work on.

07:11.963 --> 07:15.470
ASHLEE:
<i>Brynn and I actually went to</i>
<i>Europe with Abby for two weeks.</i>

07:15.470 --> 07:17.875
Traveling with Abby allowed
Abby and I

07:17.875 --> 07:20.012
to really get
to know each other more.

07:20.012 --> 07:24.856
<i>I think Abby hopefully saw</i>
<i>that I'm a very loyal friend,</i>

07:24.856 --> 07:26.559
and I only want real friends.

07:26.559 --> 07:28.697
I do not do
the fake friend thing.

07:28.697 --> 07:30.567
ABBY LEE:
All right, so,

07:30.567 --> 07:34.709
we are traveling...
to San Jose, California.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.780
We are going to Dream

07:36.780 --> 07:37.948
National Dance
Competition.

07:37.948 --> 07:39.418
HOLLY:
Oh, wait, wait. Abby,

07:39.418 --> 07:41.723
just so you know,
I will not be here Friday.

07:41.723 --> 07:43.259
I'm flying back home,
but I will

07:43.259 --> 07:44.461
be back for competition

07:44.461 --> 07:45.564
on Saturday.

07:45.564 --> 07:47.000
I am a celebrity judge

07:47.000 --> 07:48.737
for a dance competition.
JILL: That's fun.

07:48.737 --> 07:50.306
See, they all want to be me.

07:50.306 --> 07:51.709
(laughter)

07:51.709 --> 07:53.647
Well, in the past,

07:53.647 --> 07:55.216
as Holly knows,

07:55.216 --> 07:56.719
the kids traveled with me.

07:56.719 --> 07:58.890
Mothers didn't go.

07:58.890 --> 08:00.493
So I would love to have you go,

08:00.493 --> 08:02.665
stay Friday night.

08:02.665 --> 08:04.100
I'll get two double beds,

08:04.100 --> 08:05.704
and I will be your

08:05.704 --> 08:07.307
temporary guardian.

08:07.307 --> 08:08.375
What?!

08:08.375 --> 08:09.612
Yeah, she'll just go with me.

08:09.612 --> 08:11.114
HOLLY: Oh, we have to
talk about that.

08:11.114 --> 08:12.952
We had made arrangements
with Kira and Kalani.

08:12.952 --> 08:14.822
I know they were excited
about doing, like,

08:14.822 --> 08:16.826
a little sleepover.
Hmm.

08:16.826 --> 08:18.062
But I am intrigued
that you are...

08:18.062 --> 08:19.699
you want to be so involved
with Nia now.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.468
It's just, like,
it's so different.

08:21.468 --> 08:25.009
That's fabulous,
but at the same time,

08:25.009 --> 08:27.648
<i>I have to be cautiously</i>
<i>optimistic, and think,</i>

08:27.648 --> 08:29.752
is there another motive

08:29.752 --> 08:32.725
behind Abby's
newfound interest in Nia?

08:32.725 --> 08:34.529
<i>Nia and I will have</i>
<i>to talk about this.</i>

08:34.529 --> 08:35.564
ABBY LEE:
All right.

08:35.564 --> 08:37.568
I need to get
to the competition.

08:37.568 --> 08:41.609
The group routine is something
you should all be familiar with.

08:41.609 --> 08:43.780
"When the Saints
Go Marching In."

08:43.780 --> 08:46.519
Now, we're calling this
piece "The Saints."

08:46.519 --> 08:48.657
But before I say
anything else about this,

08:48.657 --> 08:49.992
uh, excuse me once.

08:49.992 --> 08:51.629
I want to get through here.

08:51.629 --> 08:52.998
<i>The performance value</i>

08:52.998 --> 08:56.405
<i>in this group routine</i>
<i>has to be over the top,</i>

08:56.405 --> 08:57.841
<i>especially without Maddie,</i>

08:57.841 --> 09:01.549
<i>and that's going to take</i>
<i>acting classes,</i>

09:01.549 --> 09:04.287
music classes, voice lessons,

09:04.287 --> 09:08.830
as well as
the proverbial partner or two.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.437
Uh‐oh.
Yes!

09:12.437 --> 09:13.907
Oh, wow!
Hey!

09:13.907 --> 09:15.877
Hi.

09:15.877 --> 09:17.146
I'm gonna let
these two young men

09:17.146 --> 09:18.282
introduce themselves.

09:18.282 --> 09:19.284
Go ahead.

09:19.284 --> 09:21.455
Hi. I'm Yadi.
And I'm Will.

09:21.455 --> 09:22.925
ABBY LEE:
They are

09:22.925 --> 09:24.762
joining us
for the group routine.

09:24.762 --> 09:26.566
But I'm not gonna bring them in

09:26.566 --> 09:28.870
and then not utilize
their skills, as well.

09:28.870 --> 09:30.807
So we have two duets.

09:30.807 --> 09:32.811
(gasps)
The first duet

09:32.811 --> 09:35.817
is going to Kendall.

09:35.817 --> 09:37.186
(applause)
And big Will.

09:37.186 --> 09:39.625
Yay!
(cheering)

09:39.625 --> 09:41.629
ABBY LEE:
Okay?

09:41.629 --> 09:43.533
And you two will
be doing "Bag,

09:43.533 --> 09:45.771
Borrow and Steal."

09:45.771 --> 09:48.810
KENDALL:
<i>It's my first week back,</i>
<i>and I get a duet with a boy.</i>

09:48.810 --> 09:51.181
<i>It's my first time</i>
<i>dancing with a boy ever.</i>

09:51.181 --> 09:53.753
So I hope I do well and win.

09:53.753 --> 09:55.489
ABBY LEE:
My next duet

09:55.489 --> 09:56.693
goes to Brynn.

09:56.693 --> 09:59.497
Brynn will be
dancing with Yadi.

09:59.497 --> 10:01.101
Why don't you go over there.

10:01.101 --> 10:05.577
And the name of this routine
is "Scary Sweetheart."

10:05.577 --> 10:07.848
It's gonna be cool,

10:07.848 --> 10:10.419
but you have to act.

10:10.419 --> 10:11.789
ASHLEE: <i>I'm not surprised</i>
<i>that Brynn and Kendall</i>

10:11.789 --> 10:14.194
have been given duets
against each other.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.666
<i>Brynn has been slated to be</i>

10:16.666 --> 10:18.469
the next "Maddie of this team"

10:18.469 --> 10:20.406
since the minute
she walked in the door,

10:20.406 --> 10:22.678
<i>and Kendall has been</i>
<i>her main competition.</i>

10:22.678 --> 10:24.080
ABBY LEE:
So these are both

10:24.080 --> 10:25.216
complex stories.

10:25.216 --> 10:29.224
On stage, you guys
have to pull it off.

10:29.224 --> 10:32.063
HOLLY: <i>Knowing how volatile</i>
<i>the relationship has been</i>

10:32.063 --> 10:35.604
<i>between Ashlee and Jill,</i>
<i>I wasn't expecting Abby</i>

10:35.604 --> 10:39.545
to put Brynn and Kendall
head‐to‐head week one.

10:39.545 --> 10:41.582
I think if you're talking
about new beginnings,

10:41.582 --> 10:43.452
<i>probably not the best scenario.</i>

10:43.452 --> 10:45.122
ABBY LEE:
Okay.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.692
So let's get going.
On with the show.

10:57.413 --> 10:59.117
ABBY LEE: <i>"When the Saints</i>
<i>Go Marching In,"</i>

10:59.117 --> 11:00.587
<i>this was a procession.</i>

11:00.587 --> 11:03.860
It happened during a funeral,
and it became

11:03.860 --> 11:05.931
a celebration of life.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.935
<i>It turned into a party, okay?</i>

11:07.935 --> 11:09.470
<i>But that's where</i>
<i>this came from.</i>

11:09.470 --> 11:11.776
I just want you to have a little
history on what you're doing.

11:11.776 --> 11:13.780
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

11:13.780 --> 11:15.550
("When the Saints
Go Marching In" playing)

11:15.550 --> 11:18.355
You're coming downstage,
so just be, like, funky.

11:18.355 --> 11:20.125
Like, just give me this for now.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.161
Just give me that.

11:21.161 --> 11:22.931
Good. Okay, so then,
if you were, like...

11:22.931 --> 11:26.873
if you guys were, like,
out to the side like ba‐ba‐ba.

11:26.873 --> 11:29.043
And you guys are up in the back.

11:29.043 --> 11:32.584
That's‐that's like
what the feel is.

11:32.584 --> 11:33.820
The group routine

11:33.820 --> 11:35.757
<i>is entitled "The Saints."</i>

11:35.757 --> 11:38.863
<i>It's set way down</i>
<i>in New Orleans.</i>

11:38.863 --> 11:41.234
<i>It celebrates new beginnings.</i>

11:41.234 --> 11:42.938
We're not sad about the past.

11:42.938 --> 11:44.808
We're excited about the future.

11:44.808 --> 11:49.317
<i>And everybody better</i>
<i>excite those judges</i>

11:49.317 --> 11:51.589
into giving them
a perfect score.

11:51.589 --> 11:56.364
Arms here on the turn
are down, in, down, in.

11:56.364 --> 11:58.803
It's like in, da, in, da.

11:58.803 --> 12:01.474
This is definitely gonna be
a big change for the girls.

12:01.474 --> 12:03.011
<i>Maddie would have held</i>

12:03.011 --> 12:05.717
<i>the rest of the group together,</i>
<i>but now</i>

12:05.717 --> 12:07.554
they get to be the next Maddie.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.925
<i>It's their time to shine.</i>

12:11.194 --> 12:12.396
And move down the street.

12:12.396 --> 12:14.668
Ba, and five, six,
freeze there,

12:14.668 --> 12:16.137
and turn around
and do your own thing.

12:16.137 --> 12:17.139
Improv, one.

12:17.139 --> 12:18.375
Ba‐ba‐ba‐ba‐ba.

12:18.375 --> 12:20.513
And five, six and back in tight.

12:20.513 --> 12:22.784
And a one, two,
three, four, and...

12:22.784 --> 12:24.722
That's what we're looking for.

12:25.757 --> 12:27.527
Well, I'm glad to
see the kids are

12:27.527 --> 12:29.798
<i>happy and...</i>
<i>'cause Abby's happy.</i>

12:29.798 --> 12:31.067
You know, what she
doesn't realize

12:31.067 --> 12:32.771
is she sets the
mood for the kids.

12:32.771 --> 12:34.207
She was in
a good mood today.

12:34.207 --> 12:36.144
HOLLY:
<i>She is.</i>

12:36.144 --> 12:38.215
<i>It's like we have</i>
<i>a new dance teacher.</i>

12:38.215 --> 12:43.191
<i>And seeing Abby in the studio,</i>
<i>actively engage,</i>

12:43.191 --> 12:45.597
<i>I think for the moms,</i>
<i>that's motivation</i>

12:45.597 --> 12:47.667
<i>for us to turn over a new leaf.</i>

12:47.667 --> 12:49.470
Last season, it was ugly.

12:49.470 --> 12:53.145
It was tense between the moms,
and we can't go back there.

12:53.145 --> 12:54.948
ASHLEE:
Jill, over the break,

12:54.948 --> 12:57.153
I read some stuff
online that you wrote,

12:57.153 --> 12:59.023
'cause I had felt like
things were getting better,

12:59.023 --> 13:00.092
so I was...

13:00.092 --> 13:01.428
Wait, wait, wait.
ASHLEE: You know.

13:01.428 --> 13:02.964
What‐what are... what
are you talking about?

13:02.964 --> 13:04.735
What are we
talking about?

13:04.735 --> 13:06.071
Social media.

13:06.071 --> 13:07.741
But how... why?
I‐I just...

13:07.741 --> 13:10.179
I was surprised at some
of the comments that were made

13:10.179 --> 13:11.414
about me.

13:12.651 --> 13:14.822
If we're really wanting
to move past all that,

13:14.822 --> 13:17.226
the social media
thing, it gets worse

13:17.226 --> 13:20.099
when there's more negative
things said on top of it.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.769
It would be nice

13:21.769 --> 13:23.171
to move past it
if that would stop.

13:23.171 --> 13:24.808
JILL:
Can I just say one thing?

13:24.808 --> 13:26.377
You got to get
a really thick skin.

13:26.377 --> 13:28.115
You got to let it go.
But I feel like you're

13:28.115 --> 13:29.317
getting defensive
and I'm not

13:29.317 --> 13:30.887
trying to make you defensive.
Well, I just think

13:30.887 --> 13:33.693
we've all been through it,
and we don't bring it

13:33.693 --> 13:35.530
to anybody's attention.
You learn to deal with it.

13:35.530 --> 13:38.468
I'm sitting here, trying
to reconcile something...

13:38.468 --> 13:40.005
But do you understand
what you're doing?

13:40.005 --> 13:42.544
You're digging
up old things.

13:42.544 --> 13:43.746
I'm done.
You're always the victim.

13:43.746 --> 13:45.082
I'm not trying to be the victim.

13:45.082 --> 13:46.184
Then don't bring up

13:46.184 --> 13:47.554
old (bleep);
let's move forward.

13:49.457 --> 13:51.629
JESSALYNN: I think, honestly,
the real reason why you're upset

13:51.629 --> 13:53.566
is because Brynn has
a dance with a boy.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.835
I think there's
a lot of pressure.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.337
She has a duo
against Kendall.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.175
<i>I don't‐‐ I think sometimes</i>
<i>it's never what it is,</i>

13:58.175 --> 13:59.778
and I think
you're competitive,

13:59.778 --> 14:02.717
and I think you're really
worked up about the duo.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.153
(sighs) Oh, my God.

14:05.189 --> 14:06.559
JESSALYNN:
<i>Day one,</i>

14:06.559 --> 14:08.094
and Ashlee is crying already.

14:08.094 --> 14:10.299
<i>She's mad about social media.</i>

14:10.299 --> 14:11.467
<i>Okay, well, social media's</i>

14:11.467 --> 14:13.038
for 12‐year‐olds.

14:13.038 --> 14:14.708
<i>What are you</i>
<i>doing on it anyways?</i>

14:14.708 --> 14:15.810
<i>Like, don't</i>

14:15.810 --> 14:17.213
cry over everything.

14:17.213 --> 14:18.381
I'm not here
to coddle anybody.

14:18.381 --> 14:19.751
I don't give a (bleep).
I'm not.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.087
You want to go cry
in a (bleep) corner,

14:21.087 --> 14:22.657
go cry in a (bleep) corner.
JESSALYNN: (laughs) Sorry.

14:22.657 --> 14:24.026
KIRA: You want to go cry
in a (bleep) corner, go cry.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.028
(Kira and Jessalynn laughing)

14:25.028 --> 14:26.397
JESSALYNN:
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:26.397 --> 14:28.836
<i>Damn.</i>

14:28.836 --> 14:32.209
What on earth
is going on?

14:32.209 --> 14:34.848
You look more miserable
than you were out there.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.819
They're gonna turn me into

14:36.819 --> 14:38.121
a villain
every time I say anything.

14:38.121 --> 14:40.125
HOLLY: I don't know.
I don't think so.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.129
Hey, Brubles.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.705
Why are you crying again?
NIA: What's wrong?

14:46.705 --> 14:48.008
There's a lot going on.

14:48.008 --> 14:49.845
Well, they were talking about me
and you the whole time,

14:49.845 --> 14:50.913
so I heard it all.

14:50.913 --> 14:52.449
I know.
She hears all of it.

14:52.449 --> 14:55.222
We don't want to be the source
of the contention all the time.

14:55.222 --> 14:56.859
That's not what we want.

14:56.859 --> 14:58.596
<i>This is definitely not</i>
<i>new beginnings.</i>

14:58.596 --> 14:59.598
<i>It feels like</i>

14:59.598 --> 15:00.633
the same old crap.

15:04.006 --> 15:05.710
♪ ♪

15:07.614 --> 15:10.653
HOLLY: <i>Yesterday,</i>
<i>I will say, was the most</i>

15:10.653 --> 15:13.693
bizarre day ever.
Yeah.

15:13.693 --> 15:16.030
Abby offered
to be your guardian.

15:16.030 --> 15:18.468
Well, I mean, we already made
plans with Kira and Kalani,

15:18.468 --> 15:19.871
for me to stay
with them.
Right.

15:19.871 --> 15:22.777
So, I mean, it's kind of
like a relationship.

15:22.777 --> 15:26.785
I'm like, "Okay, well,
let's not go too fast.

15:26.785 --> 15:28.823
Let's just take it slow."

15:28.823 --> 15:31.662
(both laughing)

15:31.662 --> 15:33.331
Uh, you go, girl.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.868
I have to say, I think
it's really interesting

15:34.868 --> 15:38.174
that all of a sudden
Abby's super interested in you.

15:38.174 --> 15:41.180
<i>Nia does have</i>
<i>a blossoming career,</i>

15:41.180 --> 15:43.218
and Abby probably realizes,
"Oh, my gosh,

15:43.218 --> 15:44.755
<i>"this kid is determined.</i>

15:44.755 --> 15:46.892
<i>She's gonna do things</i>
<i>with or without me."</i>

15:46.892 --> 15:51.067
If she wants to join
that bandwagon, by all means.

15:51.067 --> 15:52.971
But join it
and be positive.

15:52.971 --> 15:54.473
Yeah.
'Cause Abby has a tendency...

15:54.473 --> 15:56.812
To, like, to just take
over the whole thing.

15:56.812 --> 15:58.949
Exactly.
You give her
a little bit of credit,

15:58.949 --> 16:01.020
and she takes the whole thing.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.224
I think
Abby is definitely capable

16:03.224 --> 16:06.063
of moving on and creating
a better relationship.

16:06.063 --> 16:07.065
But, I mean,

16:07.065 --> 16:08.736
<i>Abby's Abby, too.</i>

16:08.736 --> 16:12.176
<i>So I'm going to stay with Kira</i>

Good. Good.

27:11.894 --> 27:15.668
Because, you know, Brynn had a

27:17.839 --> 27:20.210

Okay, then

27:26.422 --> 27:28.126
why didn't you give Brynn
a swift kick in the butt?
I did!

27:28.126 --> 27:29.997

27:40.885 --> 27:42.221
So Brynn can just cry
in the bathroom,

27:42.221 --> 27:43.858
and the other girls can go
rehearse the group number.

27:43.858 --> 27:46.697
You were taking time out crying
with your daughter to Abby,

27:46.697 --> 27:49.302
when our kids needed
to learn their dance.

27:56.517 --> 27:57.686

27:57.686 --> 27:59.355
You're the only one
that consistently

27:59.355 --> 28:01.426
is rude to her,
and nobody says anything.

28:01.426 --> 28:03.598
No one was rude

She was!

28:05.334 --> 28:06.604
No, she was not.

28:06.604 --> 28:08.473
You stood there

28:08.473 --> 28:10.444
and she was standing there,
right there.

28:10.444 --> 28:12.414
No. I said she should
come and practice

of the team that she's on.

28:14.285 --> 28:16.824

35:10.450 --> 35:12.287
(dramatic music playing)

35:30.557 --> 35:32.528
(music fades, crowd cheering)

35:32.528 --> 35:34.766
(whooping)

35:41.546 --> 35:43.617
ASHLEE:
<i>Jess is such a bitch.</i>

35:43.617 --> 35:45.019
<i>No matter what the moms say,</i>

35:45.019 --> 35:47.090
I couldn't have asked for Brynn
to do any better.

35:47.090 --> 35:48.727
I was so proud of her.

35:48.727 --> 35:50.831
<i>These moms are trying</i>
<i>to make me leave,</i>

35:50.831 --> 35:52.735
<i>make me quit, make me give up,</i>

35:52.735 --> 35:55.439
<i>but Brynn and I are both</i>
<i>a lot tougher than we look.</i>

35:55.439 --> 35:57.678
MARIEL:
<i>Yadi told me,</i>

35:57.678 --> 35:59.515
he said, "Yes.

35:59.515 --> 36:01.519
But the girl that's with me..."

36:01.519 --> 36:02.755
Brynn.
Brynn.
Brynn.

36:02.755 --> 36:04.759
He say to me, "Okay. Okay.

36:04.759 --> 36:07.063
But I talk to..."
Brynn.

36:07.063 --> 36:09.735
Why did you tell
he didn't want to dance?

36:09.735 --> 36:12.508
<i>But you tell me...</i>

36:12.508 --> 36:14.411
same?

36:14.411 --> 36:16.114
So, I'm a little confused.

36:16.114 --> 36:17.350
JESSALYNN:
I think that you know

36:17.350 --> 36:19.487
"dance, no dance."
That's okay.

36:19.487 --> 36:21.158
You're not‐‐ you know
what you're talking about.

36:21.158 --> 36:22.528
Yeah, it's all good.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.497
I think that we all know
Brynn didn't like the dance.

36:24.497 --> 36:26.468
She didn't want to do it.
ASHLEE: Oh, (bleep).

36:26.468 --> 36:28.540
So, I mean‐‐ oh, so you're
calling her a liar.

36:28.540 --> 36:29.775
No.
I mean,
that's really nice

36:29.775 --> 36:31.378
to do to
your duet partner.

36:31.378 --> 36:33.082
Nice.
No, I'm calling you (bleep).

36:33.082 --> 36:35.019
I said what you were
saying was (bleep).
I believe her.

36:35.019 --> 36:36.890
But that's what she just said.
I believe her.
I believe her.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.292
I believe the kids!

36:38.292 --> 36:40.229
ASHLEE:
<i>Obviously, Yadi's mom</i>

36:40.229 --> 36:41.966
doesn't speak very good English.

36:41.966 --> 36:44.739
<i>But Jill and Jess are only</i>
<i>hearing what they want to hear.</i>

36:44.739 --> 36:47.878
<i>Brynn is not the reason why</i>
<i>the dance was delayed.</i>

36:47.878 --> 36:49.515
<i>I have been doing this</i>
<i>long enough to know</i>

36:49.515 --> 36:50.851
<i>what jealousy looks like.</i>

36:50.851 --> 36:52.387
<i>And that's fine;</i>
<i>they can be jealous,</i>

36:52.387 --> 36:54.992
<i>but they don't have to</i>
<i>be mean to Brynn.</i>

36:54.992 --> 36:57.030
I have two conflicting stories.

36:57.030 --> 36:59.234
I'm not trying to
make anything up.

36:59.234 --> 37:00.269
Why do we bother?
Mm‐hmm.

37:00.269 --> 37:01.806
I don't know. Uh‐uh.

37:01.806 --> 37:03.710
I hope Brynn gets
lots of duets this season

37:03.710 --> 37:05.948
because this is amazing.
Let's go.

37:05.948 --> 37:07.116
JILL:
<i>I'm tired of it.</i>

37:07.116 --> 37:09.220
<i>"Poor me, poor Brynn."</i>
<i>Get over it.</i>

37:09.220 --> 37:11.626
If you want to be
a part of the team,

37:11.626 --> 37:14.565
start acting like a team member.

37:14.565 --> 37:17.671
<i>Quit playing the victim.</i>

37:27.357 --> 37:28.727
ABBY LEE:
All right, so, girls,

37:28.727 --> 37:31.632
two kids in your group

37:31.632 --> 37:34.471
that you stood next to
for that many years

37:34.471 --> 37:38.680
that is working
professional,

37:38.680 --> 37:42.921
that should prove to you
that you can, too.

37:42.921 --> 37:44.725
Every kid has
their time to shine.

37:44.725 --> 37:48.198
Right now,
you are here

37:48.198 --> 37:51.506
and you will
give it 100%.

37:51.506 --> 37:53.409
All right? Let's go.

37:53.409 --> 37:54.678
JILL:
<i>Regardless of the drama,</i>

37:54.678 --> 37:58.152
<i>these girls</i>
<i>have to stay focused.</i>

37:58.152 --> 37:59.822
<i>Because we have to</i>

37:59.822 --> 38:02.060
go out there
and nail this dance

38:02.060 --> 38:03.730
<i>and prove that,</i>

38:03.730 --> 38:05.700
<i>with or without</i>
<i>Maddie and Mackenzie,</i>

38:05.700 --> 38:06.869
we can do it.

38:06.869 --> 38:08.840

<i>The turns were together.</i>

40:18.566 --> 40:19.968

HOST:
All right. Are you ready?

40:34.598 --> 40:38.639
First up is our elite
teen duet/trios.

40:38.639 --> 40:40.543
ABBY LEE:
<i>Kendall and Brynn</i>

40:40.543 --> 40:44.283
were given duets this week
to challenge them as performers.

40:44.283 --> 40:46.522
<i>But yet, this whole entire week</i>
<i>was a challenge,</i>

40:46.522 --> 40:48.425
<i>because all the moms fighting</i>
<i>and bickering,</i>

40:48.425 --> 40:49.828
and the screaming
and the yelling

40:49.828 --> 40:52.099
and the tears and the crying
have an effect

40:52.099 --> 40:54.671
<i>on these girls, and the sooner</i>
<i>they realize that,</i>

40:54.671 --> 40:56.341
<i>the better off</i>
<i>their kids are gonna be.</i>

40:56.341 --> 40:57.944
In fourth place...

41:05.860 --> 41:08.633
...entry number 25.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.104
(crowd cheering)

41:11.104 --> 41:14.210
ASHLEE:
<i>Fourth is always disappointing.</i>

41:14.210 --> 41:15.547
Nobody ever goes out

41:15.547 --> 41:17.283
<i>'cause they want to win</i>
<i>fourth place.</i>

41:17.283 --> 41:20.088
<i>It's hard for Brynn to have</i>
<i>her best performances</i>

41:20.088 --> 41:22.493
<i>when there's so much drama</i>
<i>going on with the moms.</i>

41:22.493 --> 41:24.765
She's never gonna become
the dancer she can be

41:24.765 --> 41:26.434
<i>if she's constantly having</i>

41:26.434 --> 41:29.040
adults make her doubt herself
and doubt her talent.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.545
(laughing)

41:33.315 --> 41:34.283
In third place...

41:40.262 --> 41:42.233
..."Bag, Borrow, Steal."

41:42.233 --> 41:44.070
(crowd cheering)

41:45.507 --> 41:46.909
I would love to have seen

41:46.909 --> 41:50.950
<i>first overall,</i>
<i>but it was a great day.</i>

41:50.950 --> 41:52.353
They beat Brynn and Yadi.

41:52.353 --> 41:53.890
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

41:55.760 --> 41:58.666
HOST: All right,
our elite teen small group.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.603
JESSALYNN:
<i>It's important for us to win</i>

42:00.603 --> 42:03.041
because it's our first week
without Maddie and Mackenzie.

42:03.041 --> 42:06.047
<i>We believe in our girls,</i>
<i>but a win</i>

42:06.047 --> 42:09.555
solidifies what we know
in our hearts.

42:09.555 --> 42:11.759
<i>This is still a great team.</i>

42:11.759 --> 42:12.827
In second place...

42:20.208 --> 42:22.479
HOST:
<i>Our elite teen small group.</i>

42:22.479 --> 42:23.583
In second place...

42:27.423 --> 42:30.630
...is entry number 71,
"Break the Silence."

42:30.630 --> 42:33.001

42:33.001 --> 42:36.675

42:53.509 --> 42:54.911
Us?! Really?

42:54.911 --> 42:56.414
And what studio
do you dance with?

42:56.414 --> 42:59.020
GIRLS:
Abby Lee Dance Company!

42:59.020 --> 43:01.024
(crowd cheering, Abby whooping)

43:03.629 --> 43:07.102
HOLLY: <i>The girls' performance</i>
<i>shows the world that they</i>

43:07.102 --> 43:10.977
are stars, and they don't need
Maddie and Mackenzie.

43:10.977 --> 43:13.783
JOJO:
We won!

43:13.783 --> 43:15.887

43:15.887 --> 43:17.757
Here come our little saints.
Good job.

43:17.757 --> 43:18.959
It was good.
(Abby whoops)

43:18.959 --> 43:21.264
(others whooping)

43:21.264 --> 43:23.034
HOLLY:
The group dance

43:23.034 --> 43:24.103
was amazing.

43:24.103 --> 43:25.573
I think adding the boys

43:25.573 --> 43:27.309
was absolutely incredible.

43:27.309 --> 43:28.879
Gentlemen, thank you so much
for joining us.

43:28.879 --> 43:30.215
ASHLEE:
Thank you, guys.
(cheering)

43:30.215 --> 43:32.386
ABBY LEE: You were a
pleasure to work with.

43:32.386 --> 43:34.423
You are truly gentlemen.

43:34.423 --> 43:36.427
You are welcome
any time

43:36.427 --> 43:37.997
to join the ALDC.

43:37.997 --> 43:39.601
We would love to have you.

43:39.601 --> 43:41.037
You guys were great.
Thank you.

43:41.037 --> 43:42.439
ABBY LEE:
All right, girls,

43:42.439 --> 43:46.180
I'm very proud of all of
you this week, but, Brynn,

43:46.180 --> 43:47.416
no more tears.

43:48.953 --> 43:50.623
That goes for
everyone.

43:50.623 --> 43:52.292
Okay, just be consistent.

43:52.292 --> 43:53.394
I think

43:53.394 --> 43:55.031
we're asking you
to be consistent

43:55.031 --> 43:57.336
with every single child.

43:57.336 --> 43:58.606
Not one, not three.

43:58.606 --> 43:59.975
And, Jill...
Every one, because

43:59.975 --> 44:01.979
sometimes some get away
with things

44:01.979 --> 44:06.487
that another kid would never
get away with, or parent.

44:06.487 --> 44:08.626
Here's the thing.
I like your new beginnings.

44:08.626 --> 44:10.963
I like that you want
to be involved with everyone.

44:10.963 --> 44:13.067
I want to believe it,
and I want it to happen.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.706
I don't want you
to say one thing

44:15.706 --> 44:17.409
and do another thing.

44:17.409 --> 44:19.246
It's the
inequalities with

44:19.246 --> 44:21.250
the way you treat the kids.
Like, if Kendall

44:21.250 --> 44:22.954
was crying
and didn't like her dance,

44:22.954 --> 44:24.490
you would take it away.

44:24.490 --> 44:27.196
I just feel that I've raised
them more to be tougher.

44:27.196 --> 44:29.466
You're just making excuses.
JILL: You can't do that.
You have to be equal.

44:29.466 --> 44:30.870
ABBY LEE: I'm not trying
to make an excuse.

44:30.870 --> 44:32.740
I'm just saying,
they've been with me longer.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.243
They know how I am,
and they know what

44:34.243 --> 44:36.380
is expected of them. Period.

44:38.017 --> 44:40.121
Uh, the two of you‐‐
you want to explain

44:40.121 --> 44:41.658
what happened backstage?

44:48.505 --> 44:50.242
JESSALYNN:
I love the conspiracy.
I love it.

44:50.242 --> 44:52.312
It's not a conspiracy.
It's the opposite.

44:52.312 --> 44:54.651
But the mother told us
differently. The mother!

44:54.651 --> 44:55.920
JESSALYNN:
So she doesn't

44:55.920 --> 44:57.557
know the difference
between boy and girl?

44:57.557 --> 44:59.260
That's what y'all are saying?
Right, uh‐huh.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.997
That's good. Throw
her under the bus.

45:00.997 --> 45:02.266
HOLLY:
<i>You know what?</i>

45:02.266 --> 45:04.303
I wish I had a magic wand

45:04.303 --> 45:06.073
<i>to help Ashlee, but for years,</i>

45:06.073 --> 45:09.280
we've had to deal with Maddie
being Abby's favorite,

45:09.280 --> 45:11.050
<i>and to have someone</i>
<i>who wasn't even</i>

45:11.050 --> 45:15.626
<i>trained by Abby coming in</i>
<i>and becoming her new Maddie</i>

45:15.626 --> 45:18.197
<i>is really difficult,</i>
<i>especially for Jill.</i>

45:18.197 --> 45:20.402
<i>But it's not Brynn's fault.</i>

45:22.339 --> 45:24.678
Hope you guys feel really good
doing this to her, you know?

45:24.678 --> 45:26.682
Does it feel good, Jill?
Does it feel good, Jess?

45:26.682 --> 45:27.884
JILL:
I know. I know. It's always...

45:27.884 --> 45:29.888
Listen, I'm leaving
the premises,

45:29.888 --> 45:32.092
because I am not responsible

45:32.092 --> 45:34.330
for your kid crying
all the time!
JESSALYNN: Uh‐huh.

45:34.330 --> 45:37.937
You did it to her!
I'm not gonna be a part of this!

45:37.937 --> 45:39.741
Come on, JoJo. Come on, Kendall.
JILL: Come on.
Kendall, let's go!

45:39.741 --> 45:40.943
JESSALYNN:
Cry it out!

45:40.943 --> 45:43.114
Abby Lee Crying Studio.
JILL: Crying Studio.

45:43.114 --> 45:45.485
Let's go.
Abby Lee's Crying Studio.

45:45.485 --> 45:48.892
If you want to learn how to cry,
come here to this studio.

45:54.436 --> 45:56.307
ABBY LEE:
<i>This season on</i> Dance Moms...

<i>An integral part of this team</i>

45:59.079 --> 46:00.916
<i>but the show must go on.</i>

46:00.916 --> 46:02.419
<i>It's all about new beginnings.</i>

46:02.419 --> 46:04.023
HOLLY:
<i>I think for years,</i>

46:04.023 --> 46:05.492

46:05.492 --> 46:07.195
<i>They have so much to offer.</i>

46:07.195 --> 46:10.536
<i>Now the spotlight can be</i>
<i>on each and every one of them.</i>

46:10.536 --> 46:13.274
My reputation is on the line.

46:13.274 --> 46:16.347
<i>If you fail, it's going to be</i>
<i>a direct reflection</i>

46:16.347 --> 46:17.683

46:22.827 --> 46:25.432
I can do whatever I want.
They're going to grow.

46:25.432 --> 46:27.770

<i>Your business is thriving.</i>

46:34.784 --> 46:36.253
<i>Our children are not right now.</i>

46:36.253 --> 46:38.324
STACEY: <i>The elite team moms</i>
<i>don't want us here.</i>

46:38.324 --> 46:41.097
KIRA: <i>I'm not letting a bunch</i>
<i>of mothers of seven‐year‐olds</i>

46:41.097 --> 46:42.733
degrade our children.
ASHLEE: <i>This is</i>

46:42.733 --> 46:43.602
a (bleep) show.

46:43.602 --> 46:45.673
You're a stupid (bleep). No!

46:45.673 --> 46:47.342
JILL:
<i>We can't go down in flames.</i>

46:47.342 --> 46:48.912
We need to know
where you stand.

46:48.912 --> 46:51.150
Did you guys see
that article about Abby?

46:51.150 --> 46:52.319
HOLLY:
She filed an extension.

46:52.319 --> 46:54.323
JILL:
<i>Abby's freaking out because</i>

46:54.323 --> 46:55.526
she's facing jail time.

46:55.526 --> 46:57.162
Oh. Debbie.

46:57.162 --> 46:58.599
ASHLEE: What if Debbie Allen's
calling to take over?

46:58.599 --> 47:01.137
Would you just give her
the reigns and walk away?

47:01.137 --> 47:02.272
JILL:
<i>She is gonna be left</i>

47:02.272 --> 47:04.009
standing all alone.

47:04.009 --> 47:05.411
I really just don't give a damn!

47:05.411 --> 47:07.717
JILL:
<i>She has pushed everybody</i>

47:07.717 --> 47:09.554
who cared about her away.

47:09.554 --> 47:10.656
HOLLY:
This is not working.

47:10.656 --> 47:12.259
It's done. Our time is done.

47:12.259 --> 47:14.496
HOLLY: <i>Obviously, she's doing</i>
<i>something wrong</i>

47:14.496 --> 47:16.467
<i>if her entire team</i>
<i>keeps leaving.</i>

47:16.467 --> 47:19.006
KIRA: <i>These girls can do it</i>
<i>without Abby.</i>

47:19.006 --> 47:21.443
(screaming)
KERRI: <i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what just happened?</i>
