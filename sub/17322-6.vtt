00:15.605 --> 00:16.660
Tonight I wear some gogggles

00:16.695 --> 00:17.715
Richard falls down a small slope

00:17.750 --> 00:19.790
And James Says hello to a man

00:19.825 --> 00:21.090
All right, mate?

00:28.050 --> 00:30.990
hello, hello, good evening, thank you erverybody.

00:31.025 --> 00:33.295
thank you,thank you

00:33.330 --> 00:39.280
Now as we kown the real world where we all live if full of dreary cars,

00:39.315 --> 00:43.590
like the Renault Scenic and the Toyota... whatever this is.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.475
Which is why, in the fantasy world that is Top Gear,

00:48.510 --> 00:51.300
we prefer to feature things that are a bit more exciting,

00:51.335 --> 00:54.110
a bit more dinosaurish.

01:01.010 --> 01:02.360
Our track...

01:04.510 --> 01:09.450
.. it's the natural home of the quad cam 84 litre carnivore.

01:09.485 --> 01:12.687
From the massive Murcielago

01:12.722 --> 01:15.890
to the agile Ariel Raptor

01:15.925 --> 01:17.435
we have them all.

01:17.470 --> 01:20.400
We even have a keeper capable of taming them.

01:22.490 --> 01:27.140
The Top Gear test track? It's Jurassic Park!

01:28.440 --> 01:32.050
This week, though, there are no T Rexes. There are no raptors.

01:32.085 --> 01:36.217
There are none of those... Pssp!.. spitty things.

01:36.252 --> 01:40.350
This week, Top Gear has gone all Springwatch.

01:45.910 --> 01:48.260
This is the new BMW Z4.

01:48.295 --> 01:50.610
It's not mid-engined.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.890
It isn't a fire-breathing monster that runs on brimstone and baby owls.

01:56.925 --> 02:00.370
It's just a common-or-garden sports car.

02:00.405 --> 02:02.035
I didn't like the old Z4.

02:02.070 --> 02:06.460
I though it was too ugly and mostly driven by people

02:06.495 --> 02:10.370
who spent their evenings wife swapping.

02:10.405 --> 02:12.665
Do you know why I thought that

02:12.700 --> 02:16.570
It just whenever I thought that someone with Z4, I thought those car keys

02:16.605 --> 02:20.572
I bet them spend less time in the ignition

02:20.607 --> 02:24.505
and they doing a pot round at Muriel's house.

02:24.540 --> 02:28.870
Given the choice, I would have bought a Mercedes SLK instead.

02:28.905 --> 02:31.260
In fact,I did.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.575
This, however, is the new Z4.

02:35.610 --> 02:41.220
While it may not be much of a looker with the new aluminium roof up

02:42.360 --> 02:45.880
It is fantastic with it down

02:47.900 --> 02:51.345
it is sort of Uma Thurman-ish

02:51.380 --> 02:55.610
Perfect,But you Can't really explain why.

02:55.645 --> 02:59.840
It's the same story with the interior

03:00.490 --> 03:02.690
It's very different to any other car

03:02.725 --> 03:05.980
and that's good but so's this!

03:10.130 --> 03:12.175
That long, priapic bonnet

03:12.210 --> 03:15.130
houses a 3-litre engine which is boosted

03:15.165 --> 03:17.590
by two turbo chargers.

03:20.910 --> 03:24.450
Actually it doesn't feel like a pair of turbos.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.440
It feels like a pair of testes.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.120
Big, meaty ones!

03:33.160 --> 03:34.815
Obviously it's not a raptor

03:34.850 --> 03:41.050
but since I'm now doing 140 mph...

03:41.085 --> 03:42.350
it's not a cow either.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.430
The best thing about this car, though,

03:49.465 --> 03:51.750
is how it feels to drive.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.095
The old Z4 was too hard.

03:55.130 --> 03:58.530
Getting in to it after a hard day at work was like getting home

03:58.565 --> 04:02.220
and flopping down on a sofa made out of Chuck Norris.

04:03.350 --> 04:04.785
This one, though,

04:04.820 --> 04:08.550
they've done what Lotus did with the Evora and Jaguar with the XF -

04:08.585 --> 04:10.370
they've softened it down.

04:10.405 --> 04:12.030
It's nice!

04:13.520 --> 04:18.410
Don't think however it's become a hopeless wallowing herbivore.

04:26.580 --> 04:31.900
That intrinsic BMW-ness is still there.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.210
It's got that wonderful sense that when you turn into a corner,

04:35.245 --> 04:39.880
that the whole car is pivoting around your hips.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.090
Who'd have thought I'd come right down the food chain this week?

04:44.125 --> 04:45.800
I'm in Kate Humble's hedge

04:45.835 --> 04:47.820
And I'm loving it!

04:54.260 --> 04:59.610
Today, I'd buy a Z4 over a Mercedes SLK in a heartbeat.

04:59.645 --> 05:01.975
In fact, I'd rather have one of these

05:02.010 --> 05:05.930
than almost any of the Top Gear dinosaurs.

05:05.965 --> 05:08.920
It is THAT GOOD!

05:12.230 --> 05:16.885
'Before we move on though, there is another new car

05:16.920 --> 05:20.000
'in the Springwatch section of Top Gear's wildlife park. '

05:20.035 --> 05:23.082
(Look! Look! There it is.

05:23.117 --> 05:26.095
(That is a brown Datsun.

05:26.130 --> 05:28.625
(I realise, of course, that you might think...

05:28.660 --> 05:33.840
(that here in the whole world of pterodactyls and peacocks

05:43.220 --> 05:45.730
I'm hanging its tail out.

05:48.910 --> 05:57.340
I'm revelling... in the short wheelbase, the taut rear drive chassis.

05:59.230 --> 06:05.840
I'm on the straight and I'm UNLEASHING 326 horsepower!

06:10.610 --> 06:14.020
Eat my exhaust fumes dinosaur!

06:17.640 --> 06:21.780
This is the new Nissan 370Z GT...

06:22.590 --> 06:27.320
a shortened, more powerful version of the old 350.

06:28.080 --> 06:33.085
Prices start at 27,000 and that makes it very cheap

06:33.120 --> 06:38.090
especially when you look at all the equipment it has.

06:42.270 --> 06:45.880
I've even got something called a "SynchroRev Match system".

06:45.915 --> 06:51.135
So, In the 4th Gear, Yes, wanna change to The 2nd

06:51.170 --> 06:54.960
You hear that, it revs the engine, SO the Right speed match the revs

06:54.995 --> 06:58.285
Make the change smoother.

06:58.320 --> 07:03.520
That's very simple and very clever. - I like that.

07:05.980 --> 07:10.790
as a heart starter, this thing eats the BMW for breakfast.

07:11.420 --> 07:15.295
It's got 26 more horsepowers for a kickoff.

07:15.330 --> 07:19.170
It's a lot more... exciting as well somehow.

07:23.330 --> 07:25.325
And even this GT version,

07:25.360 --> 07:28.720
with leather seats and the rev-o-matic gearbox,

07:28.755 --> 07:33.510
is five-and-a-bit thousand pounds cheaper.

07:35.180 --> 07:39.250
THIS is a RACING hen!

07:41.430 --> 07:44.330
There is just one problem with it however.

07:44.365 --> 07:46.290
It's very nasty.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.975
It's fine here on the track

07:51.010 --> 07:55.230
but on the road, it's so hard and harsh.

07:55.265 --> 07:58.885
It's also very noise

07:58.920 --> 08:02.985
And it's not a nice noise, either.

08:03.020 --> 08:07.095
I would rather listen to my own firing squad.

08:07.130 --> 08:11.470
The worst thing about this car though, is that if you had one,

08:11.505 --> 08:14.260
you'd never get invited to a wife-swapping party.

08:14.295 --> 08:20.360
People would think you're a bit... Oddy.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.325
but, this, I love it

08:30.360 --> 08:34.455
honestly, if somebody says to me

08:34.490 --> 08:36.924
you have to have to one of these for the rest of your life,"

08:36.960 --> 08:39.610
I Would be delighted. Yes, It's great,I Like... It's brilliant car

08:39.645 --> 08:41.490
however we must now find out how fast this,

08:41.525 --> 08:43.965
and indeed the hen go round our track,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.680
which of course means handing them over to our tame racing driver.

08:47.715 --> 08:54.490
Some say that on Thursdays he becomes incredibly bulbous...

08:56.280 --> 09:04.630
.. and that recently pigs in Mexico have started to die of something called "Stig flu".

09:04.665 --> 09:08.850
All we know is he's highly contagious.

09:10.820 --> 09:14.340
And they're off! I have to say, these cars aren't really comparable.

09:14.375 --> 09:18.402
The Nissan is loud and aggressive, the BMW more day-to-day

09:18.437 --> 09:22.430
but they both look tidy through the first corner there.

09:22.465 --> 09:24.770
Yep, no problems at all.

09:30.780 --> 09:34.460
Oh, dear, it sounds like two sets of bagpipe music there.

09:34.495 --> 09:38.085
Hard to tell really with bagpipes. Anyway...

09:38.120 --> 09:41.175
we're round Chicago nicely. Coming up to Hammerhead.

09:41.210 --> 09:46.210
Looks the BMW might be having a bit- of understeer there. Yes, it is!

09:46.245 --> 09:48.245
But at least he's OK with the gear change

09:48.280 --> 09:53.910
cos the Stig's in the automatic which BMW say is actually faster.

09:58.730 --> 10:02.230
So It's the Datsun got there, Follow-Through.

10:02.265 --> 10:04.650
My word! Now the BMW's got an oversteer!

10:04.685 --> 10:06.545
I've never seen that there before!

10:06.580 --> 10:09.890
The Nissan has no problem at all. Two corners left.

10:09.925 --> 10:12.432
The BMW kicking out its tail again!

10:12.467 --> 10:14.905
The Nissan rather boring in comparison.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.870
But... Yes, now look at it! It's showboating! And there they go!

10:17.905 --> 10:21.020
Across the line!

10:24.920 --> 10:29.805
Mmm? Now... here we have the Nissan,- look.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.840
The Nissan did it in 1 minute 27.5 and the BMW...

10:34.875 --> 10:37.692
1 minute 28.2.

10:37.727 --> 10:40.475
So that goes...

10:40.510 --> 10:42.795
there. So what we're saying here,

10:42.830 --> 10:47.355
really, is, er, buy the BMW because it's slower,

10:47.390 --> 10:52.490
less exciting, more expensive and less well-equipped.

10:52.525 --> 10:55.205
And now the news. And the big news this week -

10:55.240 --> 10:57.955
the government wants to put up signs on the motorway

10:57.990 --> 11:01.955
telling drivers to pull over at the next junction, get out

11:01.990 --> 11:06.085
and swap their car for publictransport which is kind of puzzling.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.320
cos why would you, when you're in the car already,- would you just stop

11:09.355 --> 11:11.035
and then get on a train? I don't know.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.775
It's like going to the cinema and a sign says, "

11:13.810 --> 11:16.480
"Have you thought about reading a book?" Yes!

11:16.515 --> 11:18.247
It's too late. I'm in the cinema!

11:18.282 --> 11:19.945
What are the signs going to say?

11:19.980 --> 11:22.840
"Don't need to be on time or near where you actully want to go?

11:22.875 --> 11:25.385
"The railway station is next left. "-

11:25.420 --> 11:27.875
"Something missing from your daily commute?"

11:27.910 --> 11:29.830
Yes, a foul smell from a stranger sitting next to me.

11:29.865 --> 11:31.725
Is that what they intend for us to do?

11:31.760 --> 11:36.180
I tell you what. You know the Government announced earlier this week that 60,000 people

11:36.215 --> 11:39.790
are going to be laid waste by swine flu? What they ought to be telling us

11:39.825 --> 11:45.065
is under no circumstances use public transport.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.165
That's the point. You're right. The funny thing is...

11:47.200 --> 11:50.860
swine flu is getting a bad press. Well... Have you noticed?

11:50.895 --> 11:54.485
You see? It is. They're saying it's bad for the economy

11:54.520 --> 11:57.645
because no-one will buy anything and there'll be a lot of absenteeism

11:57.680 --> 12:02.680
but look at it this way, parking spaces for the rest of us will be easy to find.

12:02.715 --> 12:03.885
That's a good point.

12:03.920 --> 12:08.760
Now, you know I've been saying for years, and years that Porsches are getting uglier -

12:08.795 --> 12:10.355
Cayman, Cayenne, "coxter"

12:10.390 --> 12:12.030
and that thing you were driving the other day, the Panamera? Yeah. I've...

12:12.065 --> 12:16.035
I've worked out why they're now so ugly. OK?

12:16.070 --> 12:21.050
I've got a photograph of the managing director of Lamborghini. What do you think of him?

12:21.085 --> 12:25.332
He looks like a male model. Look it is. He's absolutely magnificent to behold.

12:25.367 --> 12:29.580
I've got a photograph also of the managing director of Ferrari. more than that

12:29.615 --> 12:31.092
He runs Fiat. Look at that.

12:31.127 --> 12:32.570
Dashing. Dashing and glamorous.

12:32.605 --> 12:33.575
I've also got a photograph

12:33.610 --> 12:37.740
of the man who runs Porsche. Here he is.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.865
If he likes that moustache,

12:40.900 --> 12:44.255
which he does cos he's grown it on his own face,

12:44.290 --> 12:47.675
that would explain why he looked at the Panamera and went,

12:47.710 --> 12:51.060
"Yes! That's a good-looking car. We should make that. "

12:51.095 --> 12:53.515
On a sort of serious motoring note,

12:53.550 --> 12:57.880
it is rumoured, this is business, that VW might buy Porsche.

12:57.915 --> 12:59.000
That bodes well

12:59.100 --> 13:02.450
cos VW can make a good-looking car - a good-looking sports car. In fact, remarkably,

13:02.485 --> 13:03.715
there's one in the studio!

13:03.750 --> 13:07.285
It's over there. It's the VW BlueSport. Now that's mid-engined.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.630
It's got a two-litre diesel engine in it to start. They'll put petrol in later.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.915
There's a 60 percent chance they'll make it

13:11.950 --> 13:17.905
about two years. It's worth having a look at.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.830
"The great thing about that It's not very practical.

13:19.865 --> 13:22.157
"It's got a diesel engine,"you know all of these

13:22.192 --> 13:24.415
but it's incredibly beautiful and, as a result,

13:24.450 --> 13:28.380
I would like to buy one. Now... there's a new Range Rover.

13:28.415 --> 13:30.465
We had it in the studio last week, OK?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.840
It's got a new bumper and a new engine. That's not important.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.125
what is important, OK?-

13:33.160 --> 13:36.200
is it's got cameras in its head lamps. looking forward

13:36.235 --> 13:37.767
One on the back looking backwards

13:37.802 --> 13:39.300
And two on either side looking down.

13:39.310 --> 13:41.900
yes, these are so when you're off-roading you can see like tree stumps

13:41.935 --> 13:44.455
and bears that might be in your way

13:44.490 --> 13:46.820
That's right,These You feed the picture to your screen. Ok, your SAT screen,

13:46.855 --> 13:50.660
But it doesn't turn off when you're going along on the road.

13:50.695 --> 13:52.312
and you've got all different cameras on there

13:52.347 --> 13:53.895
yes, it's honestly, you are sitting there.

13:53.930 --> 13:57.340
You've got five different feeds coming in but you can choose which one you want.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.750
which like you're being sport director in Wimbledon,

13:58.785 --> 14:00.855
wow, choosing which one you want,

14:00.890 --> 14:03.630
yes, you think coming up to crest of the hill, that one, yeah, nice, then reverse

14:03.665 --> 14:05.920
and you get the back view on, put you foot on,

14:05.955 --> 14:08.185
you got exhaust look, it fantistic.

14:08.220 --> 14:11.685
Isn't it a bit distractive? Oh god, it's unbelievable

14:11.720 --> 14:15.115
You're not allowed to talk on a mobile phone these days

14:15.150 --> 14:18.770
but now you can direct Ben Hur while you're going along the road

14:18.805 --> 14:21.475
it's just... I haven't even got to the best bit because...

14:21.510 --> 14:25.850
got into London that other day, go on Holland Park a very pretty girl in the car behind.

14:25.885 --> 14:26.965
yeah very pretty

14:27.000 --> 14:30.215
Switched to rear camera...

14:30.250 --> 14:32.785
.. and then I found you can zoom in

14:32.820 --> 14:35.320
on parts of the girl in the car behind!

14:35.355 --> 14:36.895
So it's got lech-o-matic?

14:36.930 --> 14:42.760
And the traffic lights goes like RED,GREEN,RED,GREEN and I went like...

14:42.795 --> 14:45.405
It was just FANTASTIC!

14:45.440 --> 14:52.210
Last week, a piano was accidentally dropped on a Morris Marina as we were filming.

14:52.245 --> 14:53.725
Last time this happened,

14:53.760 --> 14:55.415
the Morris Marina Owners Club,

14:55.450 --> 14:58.980
which is like the provisional wing of the Morris men,

14:59.015 --> 15:02.135
were absolutely furious. They went berserk.

15:02.170 --> 15:04.575
There's been a lot of internet activity on the Morris chatroom.

15:04.610 --> 15:11.890
"I'm going to send an email to the BBC and I don't care if they don't read it!"

15:11.925 --> 15:14.060
Now that's what they said last time, OK?

15:14.095 --> 15:15.985
This time it's getting worse.

15:16.020 --> 15:18.415
They said they'd get physical. I'm quoting now.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.810
One of them says, and I'm not making this up,

15:20.845 --> 15:24.055
"If I see Jeremy Clarkson in the street,

15:24.090 --> 15:27.380
I will poo into my hand and throw it at him. "

15:28.540 --> 15:31.675
What?! They'll poo into their own hand?!

15:31.710 --> 15:35.360
What a stupid way of getting someone. It's like an assassin lining up on the target

15:35.395 --> 15:38.620
and shooting them through his own head!

15:38.655 --> 15:39.475
It's revolting.

15:39.510 --> 15:44.080
The thing is, last week when we were making the film you probably saw out in France,

15:44.115 --> 15:48.190
there was doubt as to who actually owned the car that you ended up driving.

15:48.225 --> 15:51.050
Was it the wife of the president of- the Morris Marina Owners Club

15:51.085 --> 15:53.885
or was the wife of the President of France

15:53.920 --> 15:56.925
who is of course it's Carla Bruni? That was cleared up this week

15:56.960 --> 16:01.100
because Carla Bruni went to Nelson Mandela's birthday party in New York

16:01.135 --> 16:05.050
Where she sang a song which clears everything up

16:29.830 --> 16:31.880
Now we know. You're history.

16:37.380 --> 16:42.030
Now, we are constantly being told, mostly by people who wear slacks,

16:42.065 --> 16:45.890
that classic cars are more fun than modern ones. < Yes!

16:45.925 --> 16:48.105
There was a yes over there. The thing is, though,

16:48.140 --> 16:51.655
we weren't sure. So the producers gave each of us GBP 3,000

16:51.690 --> 16:55.135
and told us to go to a classic car auction in King's Lynn

16:55.170 --> 17:00.970
which is famous for being nowhere near anywhere else in the world.

17:01.880 --> 17:06.170
They said we could buy anything we wanted as long as it was built before 1982

17:06.204 --> 17:09.435
and then, when we had cars, there would not

17:09.470 --> 17:12.770
be the usual series of small challenges but one big one.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.680
'After a 2,000 mile drive, we arrived...

17:16.714 --> 17:19.569
'at the wrong place

17:20.170 --> 17:21.825
'and then the right one

17:21.859 --> 17:24.369
'where, inside the shed... ' All right, mate?

17:24.405 --> 17:27.040
'.. there were many cars to choose from. '

17:28.099 --> 17:30.925
"The Teesside Yesteryear Motor Club. "

17:30.960 --> 17:35.820
How much do I not want to go out for dinner with anyone who's a member of that

17:37.600 --> 17:40.535
Yeah, a '68 Daimler.

17:40.570 --> 17:46.620
It's V8 but a tiny capacity so a busy little engine and too expensive unless it goes cheap.

17:46.655 --> 17:47.970
You never know.

17:49.150 --> 17:52.435
'As the start time neared, we took our seats. '

17:52.470 --> 17:55.335
This is the first time I've ever been to a car auction.

17:55.370 --> 17:58.165
It's fantastically exciting. We could leave with anything.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.540
At auctions in the past, normally I'm the one at the back, drunk out of my mind,

18:02.575 --> 18:05.560
bidding for signed rugby balls. Those are charity auctions.

18:08.260 --> 18:09.605
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:09.640 --> 18:11.710
we will now get the first car in. Here we go. Here we go.

18:11.745 --> 18:13.805
Here we go. What is that?

18:13.840 --> 18:18.795
A London taxi. A Lanchester LJ 200.

18:18.830 --> 18:22.920
"1953. No documents. Condition - three. " No documents

18:22.955 --> 18:25.530
Who'll start me? 500? Quickly!

18:25.565 --> 18:27.675
500? 500, thank you, sir.

18:27.710 --> 18:30.810
500, I'm bid. What are you doing?! I'm getting on with it.

18:30.845 --> 18:32.305
It's the first one.

18:32.340 --> 18:36.185
I'm doing what they did in nightclubs in Yorkshire. 700, I'm bid.

18:36.220 --> 18:40.030
At 700. I'm going ugly early. Go in, get the first one you can.

18:40.065 --> 18:42.130
1,000 bid. It's a car. I'm after it.

18:42.165 --> 18:44.730
At GBP1,000. Give it to me.

18:44.765 --> 18:45.745
Thank you, sir.

18:45.780 --> 18:52.070
That's mine. You bought it?! madman! Look at the back of it

18:52.105 --> 18:55.335
What do you mean "go ugly early"? You go in...

18:55.370 --> 18:58.240
I did it in nightclubs. When I was in Ripon, you'd walk in

18:58.275 --> 19:01.075
and the first girl that's breathing you go to her and go,

19:01.110 --> 19:04.030
"Hi, love,how are you doing?" You've pulled. That is. Job's done

19:04.065 --> 19:06.620
Your mates who think that in a minute Ursula Andress

19:06.655 --> 19:09.220
is going to turn up, and she didn't, are stuck.

19:09.255 --> 19:12.180
'The next lot was a tasty Ford Cortina. '

19:12.215 --> 19:13.345
Bang on. Bang on.

19:13.380 --> 19:16.650
On my right, 220. 220. 240. 260. 280? 280.

19:16.685 --> 19:18.705
300. At 320. 320...

19:18.740 --> 19:20.990
I bid! You did. You're still in it.

19:21.025 --> 19:22.555
.. 420. 440...

19:22.590 --> 19:24.995
I'm not sure. I want a convertible.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.560
Oh, have it! If you chicken out now,- you won't get it.

19:28.595 --> 19:30.435
Go on! Come on!

19:30.470 --> 19:31.795
.. 530. Quickly! 540.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.340
No, I'm hanging on. I'm hanging on.

19:34.930 --> 19:38.460
'Several terrible cars came and went. '

19:38.495 --> 19:39.845
What the hell's this?

19:39.880 --> 19:42.665
It's an Austin Seven. I'm not interested.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.450
'Then, finally, a convertible arrived. '

19:45.485 --> 19:47.305
Hang on. 2,000 bid.

19:47.340 --> 19:50.510
'And Top Gear's auction new boy went mad. '

19:50.545 --> 19:51.917
2,400. 2,500.

19:51.952 --> 19:53.236
2,600. 2,900.

19:53.271 --> 19:54.485
At 2,900.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.665
3,000 bid.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.135
At 3,000. At 3,000.

19:57.170 --> 19:59.850
3,100. 3,200. You're making a mistake.

19:59.885 --> 20:02.760
What are you doing? 3,400. 3,500.

20:02.795 --> 20:04.390
Yes! 3,600.

20:04.425 --> 20:06.285
222.

20:06.320 --> 20:11.005
Have you thought, "Holy BLEEP!" I've just bought THAT!

20:11.040 --> 20:17.330
How much have I paid for it? GBP 3,600. I've got 600 of my own money in that?! Yes, sir.

20:17.365 --> 20:19.175
Oh, my God, what have I done?

20:19.210 --> 20:21.845
'Well, at least he'd done something

20:21.880 --> 20:25.900
'unlike James, who, as car after car went by... '

20:25.935 --> 20:27.075
Bid. No.

20:27.110 --> 20:29.065
'.. still refused to buy. '

20:29.100 --> 20:31.735
You will see. my patience will be rewarded.

20:31.770 --> 20:34.890
Spitfire Sports... Come on, James, you must bid here. No, I don't.

20:34.925 --> 20:38.270
James, it's in budget. You like the colour.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.555
Bid! Bid!

20:39.590 --> 20:43.200
'James was being so stubborn, I decided to bid on his behalf. '

20:43.235 --> 20:45.625
1,450. 1,500.

20:45.660 --> 20:51.005
Did you just bid on that, you halfwit? Yes.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.800
James, I'm warning you, if you don't buy something in a minute...

20:54.835 --> 20:57.065
This is mine. It's a Bristol,

20:57.100 --> 21:00.530
but it's got the wrong engine so it's not worth much. Watch this.

21:00.565 --> 21:04.520
Someone start me 5,000. 5,000 bid. At 5,200.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.875
5,400, 5,600...

21:05.910 --> 21:08.330
That's you stuffed, then, isn't it? We're out.

21:08.365 --> 21:09.822
6,200, 6,400...

21:09.857 --> 21:11.245
I wanted that.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.700
7,000... So, Captain Cautious, what are you gonna do now?

21:15.735 --> 21:18.455
You're starting now to look like you're in trouble.

21:18.490 --> 21:23.100
There's plenty more stuff coming through. We're now coming up to the last lot.

21:23.135 --> 21:25.970
What?! The very last lot.

21:30.610 --> 21:31.690
Oh, mate!

21:34.050 --> 21:35.920
It's nice! I don't want that.

21:36.590 --> 21:40.150
Seriously, what do we do, cos I don't want a Citroen? I don't want it!

21:40.185 --> 21:43.770
550, 600, 700... You've got to bid, mate.

21:43.805 --> 21:45.835
You've got no choice.

21:45.870 --> 21:48.360
You've got no... 900 quid?

21:48.395 --> 21:49.155
Bid.

21:49.190 --> 21:51.260
1,050, 1,110...

21:51.295 --> 21:53.330
1,150, 1,200...

21:53.960 --> 21:56.010
Oh, God. You've got to buy it, mate. Yes.

21:56.045 --> 21:58.525
1,400. 1,450!

21:58.560 --> 22:02.245
It's a lovely colour. 1,500!

22:02.280 --> 22:05.930
At 1,500... The name, sir?

22:05.965 --> 22:07.270
Worth every penny!

22:08.140 --> 22:11.200
'It was time to inspect what we'd bought. '

22:11.235 --> 22:12.945
Look at it in here.

22:12.980 --> 22:16.370
It's like driving around in a radiogram.

22:16.405 --> 22:19.545
Listen to that... Oh.

22:19.580 --> 22:22.885
This has not got an MOT, has it? I'll book it in.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.660
The first thing they're going to say is you're running on...

22:26.695 --> 22:30.215
An odd number. Three. That's good.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.530
We'll get the fourth one going andit'll be fine.

22:32.565 --> 22:34.785
I'm very confident. This is a classic.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.375
'And it was a damn sight bigger than Jeremy's classic. '

22:38.410 --> 22:42.360
This is going to be a remarkable thing, watching you fold yourself into a Midget.

22:42.395 --> 22:47.015
It isn't a Midget. It is! It's an Austin-Healy.

22:47.050 --> 22:51.015
It's a hairy-chested man's car. No, that's the big Healey.

22:51.050 --> 22:56.120
This is a little tiny Healey builtin the same factory as the MG Midget.

22:56.155 --> 22:58.930
The only difference between this and a Midget is an MG badge.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.375
Oh...

23:02.410 --> 23:04.045
Let me help you.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.645
There, you see!

23:05.680 --> 23:09.950
Let's do this scientifically. There's the top of the windscreen.

23:09.985 --> 23:13.505
'Still, at least my car wasn't medieval. '

23:13.540 --> 23:18.410
In 1977, you couldn't drink the water in France and they hadn't heard of an ignition key.

23:20.220 --> 23:22.120
How about that?

23:23.710 --> 23:26.305
What a dismal racket.

23:26.340 --> 23:30.285
'It was time to receive our challenge. '

23:30.320 --> 23:33.990
"You have been entered in a classic time trial rally

23:34.025 --> 23:36.840
"on the sunshine island of Majorca. "

23:36.875 --> 23:38.760
Ah! Majorca means...?

23:40.190 --> 23:43.015
Bad food, prawn shells in everything...

23:43.050 --> 23:46.330
Driving on the other side of the road. They drive on the wrong side of the road.

23:46.365 --> 23:48.900
My steering wheel's on the wrong side of the car.

23:48.935 --> 23:52.512
"You have two weeks to prepare your cars

23:52.547 --> 23:55.183
"and ship them there. " For a classic time...

23:55.218 --> 23:57.785
I know what they are. My wife does these.

23:57.820 --> 24:01.510
They're those ones where you have to get from A to B on difficult roads

24:01.545 --> 24:04.225
and you have to average a certain speed within the speed limit

24:04.260 --> 24:09.400
but you have to average it. We are talking some properly anal stuff here.

24:09.435 --> 24:11.610
How do you make a car ready for a rally?

24:11.645 --> 24:14.090
I dunno.

24:14.910 --> 24:18.300
'To find out, we took our cars for a spin. '

24:18.335 --> 24:21.690
So, faults. Let's just go through the faults.

24:21.725 --> 24:23.755
That window won't wind up, no big deal,

24:23.790 --> 24:29.130
and the hood here doesn't fit properly. Other than those tiny things,

24:29.165 --> 24:31.400
it's ready to rally, this one.

24:36.370 --> 24:42.530
Power - 32 horsepower, to be precise.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.210
'While waiting for a booking at the MOT centre,

24:46.245 --> 24:49.620
'I discovered something amazing. '

24:49.655 --> 24:51.450
Hold on a second.

24:52.430 --> 24:55.880
My granddad worked at Mulliner's, the coach builders.

24:55.915 --> 24:59.087
And in the 1950s, when he was there,

24:59.122 --> 25:02.260
they were making Hillman Humber Standard

25:02.295 --> 25:05.457
and Lanchester. This car's 1953,

25:05.492 --> 25:08.585
so my granddad built this car!

25:08.620 --> 25:11.700
This actual car, he was working at Mulliner's and this is what he did,

25:11.735 --> 25:15.850
he was a coach builder. He built this car!

25:18.010 --> 25:21.010
'While Richard was having his "Who Do You Think You Are?" moment,

25:21.045 --> 25:23.082
'I was not very far away,

25:23.117 --> 25:25.085
'still not going very fast. '

25:25.120 --> 25:29.820
0-60? I'll give you a few seconds to have an educated guess.

25:30.690 --> 25:34.875
No. 31.7 seconds.

25:34.910 --> 25:39.740
'Meanwhile, I was getting acquainted with Granddad's craftsmanship. '

25:40.460 --> 25:42.950
Oh, God. Third isn't working.

25:42.985 --> 25:44.240
Oh, hell.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.315
I can't get anything past second. HORN HONKS

25:47.350 --> 25:51.780
No. Granddad didn't do the gearbox. That's a Daimler gearbox.

25:51.815 --> 25:53.255
Sorry!

25:53.290 --> 25:56.130
This armrest is adjustable.

25:56.165 --> 25:58.935
I'll adjust it up a bit... Oh.

25:58.970 --> 26:03.080
My granddad didn't build that bit. That was somebody else.

26:03.115 --> 26:04.340
Day off, maybe.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.520
'Eventually, I made it to the MOT centre. '

26:16.210 --> 26:18.610
'Meanwhile, in the Healey... '

26:18.645 --> 26:20.975
God, it's even got quick steering.

26:21.010 --> 26:25.740
Everybody knows a horror story about someone who bought a car at an auction.

26:25.775 --> 26:27.480
But what you have here

26:27.515 --> 26:30.415
is a fairy story.

26:30.450 --> 26:35.600
Quite by accident, I've bought a genuinely brilliant little car.

26:35.635 --> 26:40.875
'Unlike Richard, whose MOT inspection was now finished. '

26:40.910 --> 26:44.800
You've got a hydraulic pipe that goes to the floating master cylinder

26:44.835 --> 26:47.637
and that's leaking fluid quite badly.

26:47.672 --> 26:50.440
It's a wonder you got here with it.

26:50.475 --> 26:51.245
OK. OK.

26:51.280 --> 26:53.970
The nearside front trunnion top and bottom is badly worn,

26:54.005 --> 26:57.007
the other side is following quite closely behind it.

26:57.042 --> 27:00.010
The brakes on the back are about 83% out of balance.

27:00.045 --> 27:02.575
You're got a brake hose which is floating,

27:02.610 --> 27:07.730
which is pouring fluid out of it. The shackles on the back of the spring hangers,

27:07.765 --> 27:09.315
they're in very bad condition as well.

27:09.350 --> 27:13.580
Most of the shackle pins and bits and pieces are very badly worn indeed...

27:13.615 --> 27:18.580
and some pins had missing -God...

27:25.260 --> 27:28.340
Come on, then, Hammond! Come on.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.355
Tell us...

27:29.390 --> 27:32.135
How bad was it?

27:32.170 --> 27:34.125
That's what came back.

27:34.160 --> 27:38.670
I've had worse than that! Oh, blimey.

27:38.705 --> 27:39.575
That's the actual list.

27:39.610 --> 27:44.430
That is the list of everything that was wrong with Granddad's... -that's nomorus

27:44.465 --> 27:45.795
We'll pick that up later on, but now

27:45.830 --> 27:50.095
it is time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

27:50.130 --> 27:54.325
My guest tonight has sold more records than The Beatles,

27:54.360 --> 27:59.440
but the extraordinary thing is I bet almost none of you have ever heard of him.

27:59.475 --> 28:02.577
He is the lead singer with AC/DC.

28:02.612 --> 28:05.680
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Johnson!

28:08.840 --> 28:10.050
Can't believe you're here!

28:10.720 --> 28:13.020
What a star! You've come!

28:13.630 --> 28:14.820
Fantastic!

28:15.430 --> 28:17.200
Have yourself a seat, Brian.

28:17.235 --> 28:18.935
Thank you.

28:18.970 --> 28:22.775
I am properly fascinated by how you've achieved it,

28:22.810 --> 28:26.580
cos everybody knows Jagger, Daltrey, David Van Day.

28:26.615 --> 28:29.810
Everybody knows the lead singers

28:29.845 --> 28:31.145
with these big bands.

28:31.180 --> 28:35.130
But Brian Johnson? How have you managed to stay anonymous?

28:35.165 --> 28:38.700
I think the band... It's just the way we do things.

28:38.735 --> 28:40.305
Stay under the radar, I think.

28:40.340 --> 28:43.690
You never see you on anything. You're never at a glittering gala do,

28:43.725 --> 28:47.095
you're never at Elton John's wild. No, you wouldn't be.

28:47.130 --> 28:51.140
Cos when I said Brian Johnson's coming on the show to friends,

28:51.175 --> 28:53.920
they went, "The cricket bloke? He's dead. "

28:53.955 --> 28:56.522
That's Brian Johns-TON.

28:56.557 --> 28:59.055
We enjoy keeping quiet.

28:59.090 --> 29:00.925
We can live a normal life, you know.

29:00.960 --> 29:05.490
Is this right? Black Hawk Down, obviously we've seen the film,

29:05.525 --> 29:09.985
but it was used as well, AC/DC.

29:10.020 --> 29:12.375
Mike, the helicopter pilot that went down.

29:12.410 --> 29:17.060
He'd been shot and he'd been beaten and they put him in a cell,

29:17.095 --> 29:21.710
and he thought he was finished. They kept coming and beating him.

29:21.745 --> 29:24.475
His pals knew that AC/DC were his favourite band,

29:24.510 --> 29:28.110
so they hooked a big speaker on the skid of a helicopter

29:28.145 --> 29:31.965
and they played Back In Black and Hells Bells

29:32.000 --> 29:34.750
and they flew over the city and he dragged himself up

29:34.785 --> 29:37.465
and took his shirt off and waved it out the window

29:37.500 --> 29:39.710
so they knew where he was and they went down and got him.

29:39.745 --> 29:42.175
that's fantistic,what they really means,

29:42.210 --> 29:44.710
and here is a good friends, you know we were told to each other,

29:44.745 --> 29:47.310
you know, it's good one to free him from harm.

29:47.345 --> 29:49.985
That is a fantastic story.

29:50.020 --> 29:53.175
We could rap about AC/DC for some considerable time,

29:53.210 --> 29:58.720
but you're here because you are a massive, massive car fan.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.635
Is that not...? Since I was a kid.

30:01.670 --> 30:04.865
Me father knew there was something wrong with us

30:04.900 --> 30:09.065
when I'd be walking down the street going, "Javelin, Dad. "

30:09.100 --> 30:13.235
It drove him nuts so he went to the scrap yard and got a steering wheel

30:13.270 --> 30:17.980
and he stuck a stick through it and put it through me bed head and put some pillows on it

30:18.015 --> 30:19.642
and said, "There you go. "

30:19.677 --> 30:21.235
What, so that's a car?

30:21.270 --> 30:23.565
That was me car. It was brilliant.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.895
Although there was wallpaper up there, I couldn't see it.

30:26.930 --> 30:30.155
I just saw the rest of the world and I just drove for hours.

30:30.190 --> 30:32.940
so presumably, as soon as I was assumed We're talking here about good, honest,

30:32.975 --> 30:35.655
salt of the earth, working-class Geordie upbringing -

30:35.690 --> 30:39.080
the original cars that you finally got once you were old enough, they were all what?

30:39.115 --> 30:41.045
cheerful colorful breaking down sort of stuffs

30:41.080 --> 30:46.530
Me first one, which was fabulous,it was a Ford Popular sit up and beg,

30:46.565 --> 30:52.360
which had a beige exterior and a salmon pink interior.

30:52.395 --> 30:55.905
But it was mine, it was freedom. Brilliant.

30:55.940 --> 31:00.160
You presumably go through the Mini phase at that point. Mini phase was very important

31:00.195 --> 31:02.425
because then you didn't have to hide- t

31:02.460 --> 31:04.770
the Ford Popular round the corner when you went to parties.

31:04.805 --> 31:07.685
The Mini was cool. Was it a Cooper?

31:07.720 --> 31:10.715
No, I tried to make it look like a Cooper.

31:10.750 --> 31:16.060
I put them little spready things on the back wheels, and I put go-faster stripes on.

31:16.095 --> 31:18.380
But it had sliding windows

31:18.970 --> 31:23.020
and they were very handy with the girls in the back.

31:23.055 --> 31:27.327
You could get their...

31:27.362 --> 31:31.600
I know what you mean!

31:32.260 --> 31:35.025
Sorry. I'm sorry.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.070
And obviously then AC/DC came along.

31:38.105 --> 31:38.995
Yes.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.870
So what did you get? Heavy metal band - heavy metal cars? I did.

31:42.905 --> 31:44.485
I love me classics.

31:44.520 --> 31:49.435
I bought an old Triumph Roadster, 1948.

31:49.470 --> 31:53.780
Now I drive a 1928 Bentley Le Mans 4.5 litre.

31:53.815 --> 31:58.090
Bloody hell, really? So when you say "drive",

31:58.125 --> 31:58.945
do you use it every day?

31:58.980 --> 32:01.680
I go for the paper in it, you know.

32:01.715 --> 32:03.505
It's just the way I...

32:03.540 --> 32:10.230
That's got the throttle pedal... In the middle. that's a bugger

32:10.265 --> 32:13.060
Sometimes, you know, when you're going round a corner,

32:13.095 --> 32:14.270
"I'll just break...

32:14.305 --> 32:15.295
"Oh, bugger!"

32:15.330 --> 32:17.735
It can tighten your bottom a bit.

32:17.770 --> 32:22.815
It makes your cars go like a rabbit's nose.

32:22.850 --> 32:24.820
Do you have a favourite road? Is that something you still...?

32:24.855 --> 32:27.265
cos I also get fed up with people saying,

32:27.300 --> 32:29.790
"I don't know what the point of a nice car is, there's nowhere nice to drive. "

32:29.825 --> 32:33.550
Yes,Yes, There's a lovely drive between Newcastle and Carlisle.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.325
there is a place is called Haydon Bridge,

32:36.360 --> 32:40.660
If you turn left there and go up to Alston and down the other side into the Lake District,

32:40.695 --> 32:42.407
it's probably one of the most beautiful drives.

32:42.442 --> 32:44.120
Do you know the Buttertubs Pass, North Yorkshire?

32:44.155 --> 32:46.535
Every time I've got to the other end of it,

32:46.570 --> 32:49.030
I've always had to get out and pee on the brakes.

32:49.065 --> 32:52.265
I've got a story to beat that!

32:52.300 --> 32:57.790
We were playing at this big airport in Moscow Russia when the coup happened

32:57.825 --> 32:59.775
and Yeltsin was on top of the tank

32:59.810 --> 33:04.010
and he promised all the kids, he said, "Thanks for helping," cos they helped.

33:04.045 --> 33:06.700
He said, "What do you want?" Theysaid, "We want rock'n'roll, AC/DC."

33:06.735 --> 33:11.520
So we went over and there was about a million people there.

33:11.555 --> 33:13.145
Really a million. Yeah.

33:13.180 --> 33:16.690
There was 30,000 armed guards to look after them.

33:16.725 --> 33:20.165
It was getting darker and I was bursting for a pee

33:20.200 --> 33:24.335
and I went outside and there was this little concrete plinth

33:24.370 --> 33:28.470
and I was standing there going, and these two guards went...

33:28.505 --> 33:30.775
xxx

33:30.810 --> 33:36.760
They were really upset and the translator came and I'd just pissed on Sputnik.

33:36.795 --> 33:41.540
But it was just this black ball, I didn't realise what it was.

33:41.575 --> 33:45.960
Oh, bless. So what's your day-to-day wheels now?

33:45.995 --> 33:49.055
Er, a Phantom.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.330
Me favourite car in the whole wide world.

33:51.365 --> 33:54.495
12 funnels of fun there, Jezza!

33:54.530 --> 33:58.395
It is the most fantabulous piece of engineering. Ever.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.320
When I turned 60, I thought, "I'm gonna get meself something special. "

34:00.355 --> 34:05.440
Are you over 60?! I'm 62 in October.

34:05.475 --> 34:08.045
Hoo-hoo! I'm impressed.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.250
I am very... Rock'n'roll has suited you.

34:10.284 --> 34:13.114
Yeah, aye, but...

34:13.150 --> 34:15.784
Obviously, we could could sit here and talk cars

34:15.820 --> 34:18.920
and I'd be happy to do that literally all day long,

34:18.955 --> 34:22.020
but of cause you came down to do your lap. How was it?

34:22.054 --> 34:24.465
The best time I've had since I started.

34:24.500 --> 34:28.760
I've been sitting in the back of a car getting driven everywhere.

34:28.795 --> 34:32.225
I just had a great time.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.909
Who here would like to see Brian's lap?

34:33.945 --> 34:36.955
Yes!

34:36.989 --> 34:39.969
Let's play the tape. Let's have a look how you got on.

34:40.005 --> 34:43.250
OK...

34:44.000 --> 34:48.005
# Is you is or is you ain't my baby..? #

34:48.040 --> 34:52.080
Let's see if this love of cars translates into an ability to drive well.

34:52.114 --> 34:53.685
That's... Yeah,

34:53.719 --> 34:57.475
stabbing that one in nicely... Ooh, I say.

34:57.510 --> 35:01.230
That was good. Nice and easy, like gravy.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.985
Wouldn't have thought gravy was easy,

35:04.020 --> 35:07.440
but there we are, that's tidy as well. No real problems there.

35:07.475 --> 35:10.555
Keep it cool, yeah, son. Go on, son!

35:10.590 --> 35:13.845
You're being smooth and violent at the same time,

35:13.880 --> 35:17.100
which is quite an achievement. That is bang on.

35:17.135 --> 35:20.662
Look That's perfect. That is bang on.

35:20.697 --> 35:24.155
# Oh, you must remember this... #

35:24.190 --> 35:29.350
Concentrate. No need to ask if you were flat out- through there.

35:29.385 --> 35:33.465
I'm guessing this'll be quick. It is!

35:33.500 --> 35:36.040
And now we're coming up to the second to last corner.

35:36.075 --> 35:38.085
That's beautifully done.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.600
Gambon, is that going to catch you out?

35:40.635 --> 35:47.400
No! here we are, cross the line

35:53.570 --> 35:59.450
Because it looks like when Ellen MacArthur came here,not dramatic,

35:59.485 --> 36:03.305
but you just looked quick. So.. Where do you think?

36:03.340 --> 36:06.040
I wouldn't bother looking down here. I think it got reasonable...

36:06.075 --> 36:09.725
Anywhere in the second middle!

36:09.760 --> 36:12.935
so this is What, just about there.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.900
With Well Speken man there, Hugh Grant and so on.

36:14.935 --> 36:16.115
That would be nice.

36:16.150 --> 36:19.210
well, I got a time there, so what we looking at

36:19.245 --> 36:20.835
Jay Kay over the Top 1:45,8

36:20.870 --> 36:23.800
Kevin McCloud and Simon Cowell were 1:45,9

36:24.200 --> 36:29.530
So Brian Johnson, the man nobody had ever heard of...

36:30.890 --> 36:36.630
You did it in, well... One... forty...

36:36.665 --> 36:39.292
I've forgotten.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.885
You're killin' us!

36:41.920 --> 36:48.370
.. five... Oooh!point nine.

36:48.405 --> 36:54.820
You are the second fastest man!

36:54.860 --> 37:00.880
Brian Johnson, everybody!

37:04.620 --> 37:09.950
Exactly the same as Kevin McCloud from Grand Designs, Simon Cowell,

37:09.985 --> 37:13.470
Brian Johnson, 1:45,9,Brilliant!

37:13.950 --> 37:17.085
Jay Kay will have just babbered himself!

37:17.120 --> 37:20.185
I've so enjoyed having you here today.

37:20.220 --> 37:22.220
I'm just amazed how many gifts God bestowed you with!

37:22.255 --> 37:25.195
Great singing voice, nice chap,

37:25.230 --> 37:28.250
anonymity, and now can drive a car like an angel.

37:28.285 --> 37:31.980
Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Johnson!

37:32.015 --> 37:44.820
What a man! What a man!

37:44.860 --> 37:49.810
Earlier on, we bought three classic- cars from an auction.

37:49.845 --> 37:51.515
A 1953 Lanchester,

37:51.550 --> 37:56.420
a 1977 Citroen Ami 8, and a 1969 MG Midget. It's a Healey! >

37:56.455 --> 37:59.465
It's just a Midget.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.805
Anyway, we then discovered, after we'd bought the cars,

38:02.840 --> 38:05.925
that we had just two weeks andhardly any money to get them ready

38:05.960 --> 38:12.150
for something called a Regularity Time Trial Rally, which was in Majorca.

38:17.790 --> 38:19.640
Sadly, Hammond had spent all his budget,

38:19.675 --> 38:21.455
and lots more besides,

38:21.490 --> 38:24.590
getting the Lanchester his granddad had built to work.

38:24.625 --> 38:27.220
But for once, Jeremy had donea good job,

38:27.255 --> 38:29.815
and as usual, so had I.

38:29.850 --> 38:34.750
However, before we could get going, we were given new instructions.

38:35.500 --> 38:38.805
On a classic rally, you need

38:38.840 --> 38:40.855
a co-driver to operate the timing gear and read the maps,

38:40.890 --> 38:46.510
But don't worry, the producers have provided one for reach of you.

38:46.545 --> 38:48.395
They've... I'm not worried.

38:48.430 --> 38:53.460
My betting is these co-drivers, whatever we've got in our mind, now,

38:53.495 --> 38:58.000
I'm not certain... Is not what they have provided.

38:59.620 --> 39:02.970
We weren't wrong. James had been given Madison Welsh

39:03.005 --> 39:05.285
a glamour model.

39:05.320 --> 39:09.795
Hello. Who has no interest at all in classic rallying.

39:09.830 --> 39:11.780
Have you honestly never done it? Not as a hobby or something?

39:11.815 --> 39:15.695
No, I've never done it! Seriously?

39:15.730 --> 39:19.275
! For me, things just keep getting better.

39:19.310 --> 39:22.750
Because this is my co-driver, his name is Joan Verger,

39:22.785 --> 39:26.190
he is the president of the Balearic Motorsport Federation,

39:26.225 --> 39:28.885
and an ex-Seat works driver.

39:28.920 --> 39:34.100
Presumably you know the roads in the north like the back of your hand.

39:34.135 --> 39:38.180
The mountain... roads.

39:38.780 --> 39:40.505
You speak...

39:40.540 --> 39:42.710
Don't tell me he doesn't speak English.

39:42.745 --> 39:50.230
no comprendo

39:53.760 --> 39:56.410
Richard meanwhile had been given a keen amateur mechanic

39:56.445 --> 39:59.070
called Brian Wheeler

40:01.920 --> 40:03.965
Brian!

40:04.000 --> 40:08.035
It does that, you have to imagine this in a rally situation,

40:08.070 --> 40:12.090
so the idea is we get points deducted for being early or late

40:12.125 --> 40:16.110
- at the checkpoints we have to get to. - But I can't see.

40:16.145 --> 40:20.115
granddad didn't think of that when he built it

40:20.150 --> 40:23.490
the co-drivers didn't fill us with much confidence,

40:23.525 --> 40:28.220
and then we saw the cars we'd be up against.

40:29.220 --> 40:32.260
there were Lancia Stratos', Mustangs, Corvettes

40:32.295 --> 40:35.372
and endless Porsches

40:35.407 --> 40:38.415
10911s, 11, 12...

40:38.450 --> 40:40.745
I've never seen so many 911s. 13.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.005
This Mustang is in our category.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.490
Oh, my God, how am I gonna compete against that?!

40:45.525 --> 40:48.937
And then we got even more bad news...

40:48.972 --> 40:51.726
Fantastic. You've had a great day?

40:51.761 --> 40:54.445
Yeah. Well, when did it start?

40:54.480 --> 40:57.890
Last night was the first stage, and this morning at 8.30am,

40:57.925 --> 41:00.675
we were out there. So, yeah.

41:00.710 --> 41:04.750
Five. OK... Five stages, yeah. Five stages.

41:04.785 --> 41:08.755
OK. Thank you for that. What were they saying?

41:08.790 --> 41:13.785
I don't know how this has happened. - I imagine it's James's fault,

41:13.820 --> 41:19.880
but we thought the rally started tomorrow morning. It turns out it actually started two days ago.

41:20.690 --> 41:25.950
So, even before we'd started, we knew we had no chance of winning.

41:25.985 --> 41:29.440
At the very least, we are competing- against each other.

41:29.475 --> 41:31.295
Why don't we just make it a private race?

41:31.330 --> 41:35.310
Whatever it is, it requires precision and patience, so you won't win.

41:35.345 --> 41:37.065
I bet you?25

41:37.100 --> 41:43.250
that I beat you. Three-way bet. All right. All right.

41:44.310 --> 41:47.645
And so, the next morning, two days late,

41:47.680 --> 41:51.050
with the wrong co-drivers and the wrong cars...

41:51.085 --> 41:53.510
Does anybody here know how to zero

41:53.545 --> 41:55.970
on an Austin Healey Sprite?

41:56.005 --> 41:57.990
.. we set off.

41:58.025 --> 41:59.020
Go!

42:01.330 --> 42:03.950
We've got no gear.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.750
Not got a lot to talk about.

42:15.350 --> 42:19.230
We had to arrive at various checkpoints at specified times,

42:19.265 --> 42:24.057
and then complete a number of special stages on closed roads

42:24.092 --> 42:28.850
at a precise average speed. This wouldn't be easy in the Healey.

42:28.885 --> 42:30.275
This is ridiculous.

42:30.310 --> 42:36.680
My speedometer is saying I'm doing 60mph when I'm doing about 30... No, 20.

42:36.715 --> 42:43.015
How are we going to be able to do average speeds when this is saying 60mph?

42:43.050 --> 42:48.620
When we stop at the next bit I'll write down some speed and distance formulae for you

42:48.655 --> 42:50.435
so you can work out average speeds as well.

42:50.470 --> 42:54.320
There's only two you need to know. How fast we've been going,

42:54.355 --> 42:59.220
how fast we need to go, or how long we've taken so far.

42:59.255 --> 43:00.565
You can use the two stopwatches,

43:00.600 --> 43:04.930
so you can say for 10 minutes... Mountains!

43:06.630 --> 43:09.815
Does this car smell... healthy to you?

43:09.850 --> 43:14.110
Actually, there is a slightly, um, oily smell.

43:15.540 --> 43:20.930
So the roundabout is at 127, so add another 1km...

43:23.330 --> 43:26.995
Hello?.. Hello!

43:27.030 --> 43:29.890
'Still. Could be worse. '

43:30.940 --> 43:34.900
Granddad didn't do the cooling system so it can be a bit...

43:36.330 --> 43:39.220
It's all falling out.

43:40.980 --> 43:46.155
So how long should we wait? About half an hour, for it to cool down.

43:46.190 --> 43:51.850
So we'll then have to go faster to make the... We will have to go a lot faster, and um...

43:51.885 --> 43:55.700
break a few rules, I think. It can't go much faster.

43:56.490 --> 44:01.170
Jeremy, meanwhile, was getting into the spirit of amateur rallying.

44:01.205 --> 44:05.720
Loser! Loser!

44:09.850 --> 44:13.025
We then arrived at the first closed-road stage,

44:13.060 --> 44:17.980
which we would have to complete at a specified average speed.

44:18.015 --> 44:20.032
The speed... Zero.

44:20.067 --> 44:22.015
Si... The speed.

44:22.050 --> 44:26.250
This... at what speed? Quant o...

44:26.285 --> 44:29.195
Quanto...?

44:29.230 --> 44:31.520
Which one's too tight? That one.

44:31.555 --> 44:33.570
Are you sure?

44:34.230 --> 44:40.240
It's difficult to do this without actually getting hold of the work of the divine potter.

44:40.275 --> 44:43.800
Perfecto... No, what? 50? Bien...

44:43.835 --> 44:47.715
50... No? Um...

44:47.750 --> 44:50.470
I decided to just do it flat out.

44:50.505 --> 44:53.170
We're going!

44:55.560 --> 44:58.160
Down into second... Flip the apex!

44:58.195 --> 45:01.602
'This made Joan very angry!'

45:01.637 --> 45:05.010
No, rapido, no! No, perfecto!

45:05.045 --> 45:07.295
What's that mean?!

45:07.330 --> 45:10.580
Plus lentement? Rapido? Tranquilo?

45:10.615 --> 45:13.795
Tranquilo, tranquilo. Rapido.

45:13.830 --> 45:16.175
'Meanwhile, in the Open University... '

45:16.210 --> 45:21.000
When we get to this next one, stop that stopwatch and start that one at exactly the same time.

45:21.035 --> 45:22.935
Cos you then have a record of that one

45:22.970 --> 45:24.905
and that one is then timing it to the next one.

45:24.940 --> 45:28.575
In fact, don't. That'll confuse us cos we have to take it away.

45:28.610 --> 45:32.210
Leave that one running. Jot down what the time actually said.

45:33.190 --> 45:35.195
Yeah?

45:35.230 --> 45:37.200
Yeah.

45:38.770 --> 45:41.695
We still weren't at the first stage,

45:41.730 --> 45:46.300
and Brian was less than impressed with Granddad's Lanchester.

45:46.335 --> 45:49.182
THUD Ouch! Suspension's good then.

45:49.217 --> 45:52.030
It is. I hardly felt it on this side.

45:53.300 --> 45:55.675
It's good, yes? Finish?

45:55.710 --> 45:57.750
What time? Show me the time.

45:57.785 --> 45:59.695
Time! Time, Manuel!

45:59.730 --> 46:01.865
Can't see, can't... I've no idea.

46:01.900 --> 46:06.025
I've just done something and I don't know what it was.

46:06.060 --> 46:10.150
'As it turned out,'what I'd done is go way too fast,

46:10.185 --> 46:14.150
'which meant Joan had to do yet more sums. '

46:15.910 --> 46:16.845
Maths.

46:16.880 --> 46:20.880
Can't talk to him. He's doing... literally sitting a maths exam.

46:20.915 --> 46:24.420
But I bet the conversation in the bar at night is fun.

46:24.455 --> 46:26.290
"I did more maths than you today. "

46:26.325 --> 46:28.385
"No, you didn't,

46:28.420 --> 46:32.935
"I did more maths than you. "

46:32.970 --> 46:36.330
'In fact, the only person enjoying this less than me

46:36.365 --> 46:38.325
'was James' co-driver. '

46:38.360 --> 46:42.270
Divide 60 by 55. Why do you keep saying that?

46:42.305 --> 46:44.885
It's a 60 thing, like the Assyrians had.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.025
There's not 100 seconds in a minute, there are 60,

46:47.060 --> 46:50.290
and that is a decimal... What? It's 0.85. Times 0.85 by 60.

46:50.325 --> 46:51.920
Do you- just like saying different numbers?

46:51.955 --> 46:54.365
What do I do at this roundabout? Huh?

46:54.400 --> 46:58.010
What do I do at this roundabout? What roundabout?

46:59.480 --> 47:03.240
'Brian and I had finally arrived at the first stage.

47:03.275 --> 47:05.900
'However,... '

47:07.970 --> 47:11.600
Bloody 'ell!

47:17.940 --> 47:18.985
OK,40

47:19.020 --> 47:20.005
40 miles an hour.

47:20.040 --> 47:26.685
So I'm driving about half the speed- my car can go in order to win.

47:26.720 --> 47:32.020
25 pounds is riding on this, Joan, 25 pounds, which is about 25 euros...

47:32.860 --> 47:34.630
thanks to Mr Brown.

47:35.740 --> 47:40.645
'To be honest, though, right now, my money was pretty safe. '

47:40.680 --> 47:47.820
There would only be other cars here if they were lost in exactly the same way as us.

47:49.130 --> 47:50.215
Left or right?

47:50.250 --> 47:53.440
That way. Do you know that or are you just guessing?

47:53.475 --> 47:56.460
There is a left somewhere. Is it only...

47:56.495 --> 48:01.310
There's hundreds of lefts in it.

48:02.390 --> 48:03.975
I prefer you do too.

48:04.010 --> 48:07.420
Don't do... Please, don't do that.

48:07.455 --> 48:09.935
Now! Go, go, go, go!

48:09.970 --> 48:14.200
'Finally, we were doing our first stage. However,... '

48:14.235 --> 48:17.515
Where do I go now, Brian? Forward! Forward!

48:17.550 --> 48:20.180
Can you see out of the car exactly where we're going or not?

48:20.215 --> 48:23.635
Well, I can see sort of the hills and the sky. Right.

48:23.670 --> 48:26.970
I'll tell you what's happening in front of us. It's straight ahead.

48:27.005 --> 48:29.757
I can't get this gear. It's a very big steering wheel, isn't it?

48:29.792 --> 48:32.510
Granddad liked to make sure you had good, proper-sized wheels.

48:32.545 --> 48:34.760
It makes you look smaller.

48:34.795 --> 48:37.060
Well, now, erm... OK.

48:38.330 --> 48:40.540
Oh, God, look at the steam coming out the bonnet.

48:40.575 --> 48:41.820
Oh, my word!

48:43.140 --> 48:45.435
'Realising he'd got off to a bad start,

48:45.470 --> 48:50.480
'James was now trying to charm Maddie with some romantic conversation. '

48:51.140 --> 48:54.630
It's not actually an overdrive but you need to treat it as one.

48:54.665 --> 48:56.225
It's actually a ratio of 1 to 1.

48:56.260 --> 48:58.990
It simply locks the input shaft to the output shaft.

48:59.025 --> 49:01.720
I don't know what you're talking about.

49:02.370 --> 49:05.000
Do you actually do anything to your hair?

49:05.035 --> 49:06.970
I wash it occasionally.

49:07.730 --> 49:09.170
You should wear a hair band. No.

49:15.140 --> 49:17.690
Oh, why couldn't we get one of them?

49:18.390 --> 49:21.480
That's a nice car. I bet that don't overheat.

49:23.740 --> 49:26.880
Just after lunch, we made it to the lunch stop,

49:26.915 --> 49:29.125
'where Jeremy explained that Brian and I

49:29.160 --> 49:33.900
'had amassed the biggest number of penalty points in rallying history. '

49:33.935 --> 49:37.140
So, I've got 3,600 points, the lowest points worth.

49:37.175 --> 49:40.137
You've got 41,897.

49:40.172 --> 49:43.065
And you've got 44,000.

49:43.100 --> 49:45.790
It's quite close between you two. Yeah.

49:45.825 --> 49:48.572
'To punish Jeremy for his smugness,

49:48.607 --> 49:50.923
'we decided to modify his car. '

49:50.958 --> 49:53.205
That is now the heating jammed on?

49:53.240 --> 49:56.590
Yes, the only way to turn it off is to stop... And open the bonnet.

49:56.625 --> 49:59.335
Lose vital seconds, or hours in his case

49:59.370 --> 50:01.480
because he won't be able to work out how to do that.

50:04.070 --> 50:06.365
'But as we headed off to the afternoon stages,

50:06.400 --> 50:10.990
'strangely, it was in the Citroen where things were getting hot. '

50:11.700 --> 50:14.450
I think it's in there. I can feel it.

50:14.485 --> 50:16.330
Yeah, it's a little tube. There.

50:16.365 --> 50:18.400
Yeah. Ooh! That's little!

50:19.480 --> 50:21.610
Right.

50:21.645 --> 50:23.740
Now, pout.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.360
You can't have cracked lips.

50:27.530 --> 50:29.015
I changed from first to third

50:29.050 --> 50:33.570
in my gearbox, which means technically, I short shifted.

50:34.480 --> 50:38.490
When I say short, I don't mean that... I'm not being rude.

50:38.525 --> 50:41.045
You keep saying short, don't you?

50:41.080 --> 50:44.810
No, I meant I short shifted. I wasn't being clever.

50:45.950 --> 50:46.775
In the Healey,

50:46.810 --> 50:51.310
my lunchtime smugness was starting to look premature.

50:51.345 --> 50:52.282
Hello?

50:52.317 --> 50:53.220
Ooh, God.

50:54.760 --> 50:58.845
No clutch.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.070
'This meant I'd have to choose one gear for the stage,

51:02.105 --> 51:05.600
'and then stick with it. ' Here we go.

51:09.060 --> 51:11.490
Perfect, perfect. Yes.

51:13.750 --> 51:16.605
It's all going wrong for us this afternoon!

51:16.640 --> 51:20.300
Also, I think the heater is on. Do you know how to turn it off?

51:20.335 --> 51:23.930
'But Joan wasn't going to let anything mess up his maths. '

51:23.965 --> 51:26.020
Dale, dale! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:26.680 --> 51:29.700
We've got one gear, I can do nothing!

51:29.735 --> 51:32.405
Vamos, vamos! Va, va, va!

51:32.440 --> 51:36.600
I can't reach 50 kilometres an hour- on this. It's impossible.

51:36.635 --> 51:40.730
Bueno, bueno. Fast, fast, fast! Yes, yes, yes.

51:40.765 --> 51:43.670
Your handbag's in the way. God!

51:44.380 --> 51:47.380
They're laughing at the car. They're- not. They're cheering us on.

51:47.415 --> 51:49.225
OK, if you say so.

51:49.260 --> 51:51.100
Why don't they speak English?

51:51.135 --> 51:53.685
Cos they're Spanish.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.140
'Following the shambles of the morning,

51:56.175 --> 51:58.427
'Brian was now in a right mood. '

51:58.462 --> 52:00.645
Anything to let me know about? No.

52:00.680 --> 52:02.750
What about this massive tight left-hand bend here?

52:02.785 --> 52:06.120
I haven't got a map of the route.

52:06.155 --> 52:08.025
What?

52:08.060 --> 52:10.910
I haven't got a map of the route.

52:10.945 --> 52:13.725
Come on, you should talk to me.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.140
There should be a constant stream of instructions issuing from you.

52:16.175 --> 52:17.590
Left turn coming up.

52:17.625 --> 52:18.505
In a hairpin.

52:18.540 --> 52:20.840
You're just telling me things you can see out the window

52:20.875 --> 52:23.150
now you've got a cushion!

52:30.000 --> 52:33.740
Vaya a la derecha. We're losing the brakes.

52:33.775 --> 52:36.787
I'm losing the brakes. Perfecto. Vaya, vaya.

52:36.822 --> 52:39.765
'Because the Healey was in such a bad way,

52:39.800 --> 52:44.410
'I managed to cross the line in a slow enough time for once. '

52:44.445 --> 52:48.970
We've finished. Yay! Yay! Is that good?

52:49.005 --> 52:51.370
Is that good? Ooooh!

52:52.850 --> 52:56.380
And the Loveboat finished on time as well.

52:56.415 --> 53:00.180
7.46. Yep. Spot on.

53:03.130 --> 53:05.910
Meanwhile, back in PC world...

53:07.870 --> 53:11.680
I didn't mean Jeremy's car was rubbish because it's a midget.

53:11.715 --> 53:13.570
I just meant that's what it is.

53:13.605 --> 53:15.457
It's an MG Midget...

53:15.492 --> 53:17.310
It... I'm sorry.

53:19.850 --> 53:22.360
Brian, it's making a bad noise.

53:22.395 --> 53:24.270
And a bad smell.

53:25.040 --> 53:29.360
This is... I think I may have to stop for a moment. I'm not well.

53:29.395 --> 53:33.680
'This meant Richard would miss the final checkpoint of the day.

53:34.540 --> 53:36.425
'James and I had no problems though

53:36.460 --> 53:39.540
'because all we had to do was stick to a motorway.

53:39.575 --> 53:43.600
'It was therefore impossible to get lost. '

53:44.260 --> 53:46.270
Which way? Straight on.

53:46.305 --> 53:47.640
Are you sure? No.

53:48.860 --> 53:51.180
Yeah, let's go there, it looks pretty.

53:51.215 --> 53:53.477
You don't go there because it's pretty.

53:53.512 --> 53:55.705
Well, there should be signs if it isn't.

53:55.740 --> 53:58.995
Can you not work out...? Please can you take your hat off.

53:59.030 --> 54:02.190
Please. Sorry, it's really lovely but I can't see the cars coming.

54:02.225 --> 54:06.895
Thanks. Now I've got flat hair. That's not important.

54:06.930 --> 54:11.100
'Mind you, it wasn't exactly plain sailing for me either. '

54:11.970 --> 54:14.370
Come on, please, traffic. Please, please.

54:14.405 --> 54:16.770
How can they have a rush hour in Mallorca?

54:16.805 --> 54:18.935
Nobody does anything.

54:18.970 --> 54:21.505
Get up, throw a donkey off a tower block,

54:21.540 --> 54:25.000
sit in a plastic chair by the side of the road, go to bed.

54:25.035 --> 54:27.630
Where does the rush hour come from in that?

54:28.760 --> 54:30.320
Oh, God.

54:30.980 --> 54:32.665
'Day one, then,

54:32.700 --> 54:36.020
'of our first classic rally hadn't been a total success.

54:37.730 --> 54:43.030
'However, day two sounded promising- because we were at a track.

54:43.065 --> 54:45.345
'No more maths, no more stopwatches,

54:45.380 --> 54:50.000
'just hour after hour of pedal to the metal action.

54:50.035 --> 54:51.655
'Or so I thought. '

54:51.690 --> 54:55.450
Each group does two rounds of four rounds each.

54:55.485 --> 54:57.225
The first round of each round

54:57.260 --> 55:01.480
serving as a reference time for the following three rounds...

55:01.515 --> 55:04.475
'It turned out we'd set a time on our first lap

55:04.510 --> 55:08.810
'and then we'd win if we matched that time on the next three. '

55:08.845 --> 55:10.762
Is that clear? No, I've got a question.

55:10.797 --> 55:12.645
If you break down on your first lap,

55:12.680 --> 55:16.370
do you have to then break down on the subsequent three laps?

55:16.405 --> 55:20.145
'I decided to break down before we started. '

55:20.180 --> 55:24.260
Oh, God! Have you seen the oil raining off my chassis?

55:24.295 --> 55:27.395
Oh! It's just raining oil!

55:27.430 --> 55:29.910
Come on, she'll do it. She's got to do it. She's a good old girl.

55:30.800 --> 55:35.210
That's fallen off. That's all... Yeah, I meant that.

55:42.020 --> 55:45.990
Have you done the other side? You're going to sparkle.

55:46.025 --> 55:47.475
If you or I had done that,

55:47.510 --> 55:50.830
he would kill us. Yes, he would.

55:52.890 --> 55:56.635
'We then hit the track to set our benchmark lap times.

55:56.670 --> 56:00.380
'And I decided, because the Healey was stuck in third,

56:00.415 --> 56:02.635
'to keep things steady. '

56:02.670 --> 56:05.990
Slowly, slowly, catchy monkey.

56:06.025 --> 56:09.310
Set a nice, smooth lap time.

56:09.345 --> 56:11.375
Looking good.

56:11.410 --> 56:17.850
'James, obviously trying to impress- Maddie was being more vigorous. '

56:19.750 --> 56:23.335
Like a cross Channel ferry!

56:23.370 --> 56:26.840
Your teddy bear on the spare wheel is not entirely helpful.

56:27.540 --> 56:30.920
'In the Lanchester, it was business as usual. '

56:30.955 --> 56:32.940
Was it a sort of boiling hissing sound?

56:32.975 --> 56:35.465
No, it was a clunking sound.

56:35.500 --> 56:36.715
Oh, the temperature's right up as well.

56:36.750 --> 56:38.520
You've got to ease up, you've got to ease up.

56:38.555 --> 56:41.145
Yeah, but we've got to get the time.

56:41.180 --> 56:45.410
'Despite everything though, even an official telling me to slow down,

56:45.445 --> 56:48.960
'we were all starting to enjoy ourselves. '

56:49.880 --> 56:52.340
I've seen new cars that I wanted to own today.

56:52.375 --> 56:55.062
And you can come here and you can talk to people,

56:55.097 --> 56:57.715
use words like 16 valve and not be embarrassed.

56:57.750 --> 57:00.705
you havenot to work for late You can be who you are,

57:00.740 --> 57:03.660
talk about cars, drive like a lunatic on a track.

57:04.450 --> 57:06.900
It's quite nice to be a car person again.

57:06.935 --> 57:08.540
It is.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.345
'Back on the track,

57:11.380 --> 57:14.850
'the Lanchester seemed to be behaving as normal. '

57:14.885 --> 57:17.315
Temperature's gone right up. Yeah.

57:17.350 --> 57:20.980
'I was therefore confident I'd matched my original lap time. '

57:21.015 --> 57:24.250
We did that 29 seconds faster.

57:24.285 --> 57:26.635
Did we? Yes. Oh, God.

57:26.670 --> 57:29.935
That's a disaster if we're that far adrift.

57:29.970 --> 57:35.030
'In the Loveboat, James unaware that Maddie had decorated his helmet even more

57:35.065 --> 57:38.025
was having 'the time of his life. '

57:38.060 --> 57:40.970
I think we're coming up to your first stopwatch point.

57:41.005 --> 57:43.235
Two minutes, 36.

57:43.270 --> 57:45.210
Right, reset then. Reset.

57:45.245 --> 57:47.157
1.342.36
1.34, 2.36.

57:49.026 --> 57:50.790
There you go.

57:51.820 --> 57:54.725
'Sadly, our efforts were a bit pointless

57:54.760 --> 57:57.710
'because all Jeremy had to do to win overall victory

57:57.745 --> 58:00.780
'was run calm and steady.

58:00.815 --> 58:02.465
'And he knew that. '

58:02.500 --> 58:05.790
He who shall be slowest shall be first.

58:05.825 --> 58:07.360
'But then... '

58:07.395 --> 58:07.395
Mmmm...

58:09.330 --> 58:12.640
I've got a big Mustang up my trumpet.

58:13.670 --> 58:15.520
I don't like being overtaken.

58:15.555 --> 58:17.660
It's a sign of weakness.

58:17.695 --> 58:21.677
Let's have him.

58:21.712 --> 58:25.660
O- o-o-o-oh! Power!

58:27.360 --> 58:29.700
What's Jeremy doing?

58:29.735 --> 58:31.740
Out of my way!

58:32.650 --> 58:35.695
Oh, yes!

58:35.730 --> 58:40.055
No-o-o, no-o-o, no-o-o!

58:40.090 --> 58:42.510
'My little car may have been a bit broken

58:42.545 --> 58:44.930
'but I wasn't going to let it get beaten. '

58:46.250 --> 58:49.280
Ah-ha! You weren't ready for that!

58:49.315 --> 58:51.730
'Joan even forgot the maths. '

58:51.765 --> 58:53.790
Grrrrrrr!

58:56.360 --> 58:59.340
No, this is very bad!

59:00.200 --> 59:02.325
Oh, yes!

59:02.360 --> 59:03.940
Yes, what do you think of that!

59:03.975 --> 59:05.685
Loser!

59:05.720 --> 59:08.815
'But then the penny dropped. '

59:08.850 --> 59:13.700
What I've done, I think, is accidentally got involved in a race with a Mustang,

59:13.735 --> 59:17.255
and ruined my time.

59:17.290 --> 59:20.570
'Back at the pits, there was even more bad news. '

59:20.605 --> 59:23.955
So James May was perfect? Yes.

59:23.990 --> 59:26.815
Damn it. I don't want to hear that.

59:26.850 --> 59:30.110
James, you might be in with a shout at beating me.

59:30.145 --> 59:31.325
Have you got your lap times?

59:31.360 --> 59:34.640
They're pretty consistent. But we're only doing it to the nearest second.

59:35.610 --> 59:38.390
He was only doing it to the nearest second!

59:38.425 --> 59:39.345
Hammond,

59:39.380 --> 59:42.440
he may have a flower on his helmet... What?

59:42.475 --> 59:44.192
.. but he's still James May, so...

59:44.227 --> 59:45.875
Have you put a flower on it as well?

59:45.910 --> 59:48.070
That's what I was laughing at, there's a flower on your hat.

59:48.105 --> 59:52.260
Have a look. Bloody hell.

59:53.040 --> 59:57.250
'We now had to wait to see if James had pipped me at the post.

59:57.285 --> 59:59.997
'But either way, it didn't really matter

01:00:00.032 --> 01:00:02.406
'because our three King's Lynn crocks

01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:04.745
'had made it to the finishing line.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:09.150
'And on the way, they'd wormed their way into our hearts.

01:00:09.185 --> 01:00:11.655
'In short, on this glorious island,

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:18.540
'all of us, in our own way, had fallen a little bit in love. '

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.380
This is the bet, 25 pounds.

01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:29.365
Yeah.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:29.400
25 pounds. So, who do I give it to?

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.965
Who do I give it to?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.870
You give it, Richard Hammond,...

01:00:37.905 --> 01:00:39.385
to James May.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.840
What?! He is the winner.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.875
Thank you.

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.850
Anyway, I have to say, all of us have fallen in love with the cars we had out there

01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:54.555
to such an extent that for the first time ever,

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:57.695
after a film, all three of us have actually bought them from the BBC.

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:00.750
Well, I had to buy the Lanchester, Granddad built it, it's part of the family.

01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:04.340
Now, I do have a bit of a disappointment for you on that,

01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:06.735
Hammond, because you see I discovered,

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:11.195
before the rally began if I'm honest, um...

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:14.430
How can I put this? This particular Lanchester was built

01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:17.595
by Barkers, not Mulliners.

01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:21.720
What? Which means that what you've done is bought at great expense

01:01:21.755 --> 01:01:24.045
a car built by SOMEBODY'S granddad.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.035
Oh, God! On that bombshell, ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:32.000
it's time to end, see you next week, thank you for watching, good night.
