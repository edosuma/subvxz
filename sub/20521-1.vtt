01:23.760 --> 01:25.159
Oh!

03:01.960 --> 03:03.393
Um...

03:04.000 --> 03:06.355
I got into the car
at 2:00.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.398
But then...
I was coming here.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.959
Well, I thought
I was coming here.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.918
But then Georgia
wanted to go to the loft.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.515
So then... You know,
she's my fare home,

03:17.600 --> 03:20.160
so then I had to
go to the loft.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.915
And when we got there,
she was like,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.639
"Well, now I want to take a nap."
So...

03:25.720 --> 03:28.757
Then I'm waiting
for her to, like, wake up,

03:28.840 --> 03:31.912
and then
I fell asleep.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.309
I have been asleep
all night.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.068
Are you angry?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.596
Okay. How... How angry do
you think I should be?

03:44.680 --> 03:46.016
Do you think I should be,
you know, really angry?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.736
A little bit angry?
What do you think would be

03:47.760 --> 03:49.200
appropriate right now?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.559
What's a good response?
Go on.

03:50.640 --> 03:51.993
A little angry.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.714
Can it be less angry?

03:59.320 --> 04:01.080
Mmm-hmm. We're not
going to fight about this.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.597
Fine by me.
Just not going to do it.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.110
Not going to do it.
The same old things...

04:07.960 --> 04:09.188
Going over
and over again.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.136
I get angry 'cause the
only time I get to see you

04:11.160 --> 04:12.878
is when you're hungover,

04:12.960 --> 04:14.598
and you stay home
all day and watch TV,

04:14.680 --> 04:16.875
and then you say being
out of work this long is

04:16.959 --> 04:19.076
"affecting" you.
And that isn't true?

04:19.160 --> 04:21.720
And I say you're doing nothing
to change your situation,

04:21.800 --> 04:23.616
and you tell me you're
going to prove me wrong,

04:23.640 --> 04:25.656
and then I catch you lying,
lying again to me, to yourself,

04:25.680 --> 04:26.816
because you stay home
all day,

04:26.840 --> 04:28.896
and it's just talking in circles.
I'm just getting so

04:28.920 --> 04:30.831
tired of it!
Tim...

04:35.040 --> 04:36.359
Listen.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.559
Georgia wanted
to go to the loft.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.993
I didn't even want
to go.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.794
Who the fuck is Georgia?

04:45.080 --> 04:46.115
Natasha.

04:52.640 --> 04:56.030
Gloria, you are...
You're a mess.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.354
You are out of control,
and I love you,

04:59.440 --> 05:01.670
but I cannot deal
with you in that state.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.557
What are you
talking about?

05:03.640 --> 05:05.456
So I've packed your things,
they're in the bedroom.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.232
What? What?
You can keep the cases.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.548
They're cheap ones.
What?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.359
I think it would be best for
both of us if you were not here

05:11.440 --> 05:13.271
when I got back.
Okay? So, um...

05:13.400 --> 05:14.549
Tim!

05:14.640 --> 05:15.675
Goodbye.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.308
I'm sorry.
Tim!

05:18.520 --> 05:19.555
Tim!

05:34.200 --> 05:36.555
Yeah, that's him.
Thank God!

05:36.640 --> 05:37.640
...disgusting!

05:37.720 --> 05:39.597
What do you think you're
gonna get out of that?

05:39.680 --> 05:41.079
Disgusting! I know!

05:41.160 --> 05:42.991
Must have been...
I don't know,

05:43.080 --> 05:44.176
he must have
never done anything

05:44.200 --> 05:45.560
since she was,
like, 12 years old.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.517
Probably not.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.352
Hey, Gloria!
Where's the plug?

05:49.440 --> 05:51.317
My phone is on red
right now.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.829
Trying to order some Chinese food...
Who wants an apple?

05:53.920 --> 05:55.319
No, I want
Chinese food!

05:55.400 --> 05:57.038
This is way too,
like, healthy!

05:57.120 --> 05:58.951
An apple, are you kidding me?
No.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.078
Excuse me.
Oscar?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.075
Gloria.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.718
Gloria! Wow!

08:09.080 --> 08:10.513
Oh, wow!
Whoa.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.234
I can't believe it! Uh...

08:14.320 --> 08:17.596
Oh, my God, it's a miracle
I recognized you!

08:17.680 --> 08:18.999
Well, yeah, I mean...

08:19.080 --> 08:20.399
Anyway! Hi.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.512
Yeah, hi! Hello.
Hi!

08:23.600 --> 08:26.831
Wow! Uh, so,
what are you doing here?

08:26.920 --> 08:29.992
Uh, um,
I needed a vacation.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.256
And my parents hadn't rented
out the house, and, you know,

08:32.280 --> 08:33.416
I haven't been
up here in so long,

08:33.440 --> 08:34.919
so it's just like, you know...
Sure.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.991
Yeah. Yeah.
What are you doing now?

08:37.840 --> 08:39.114
Like, right now?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.589
Nothing.
Wanna hang out?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.398
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, sure!

08:45.480 --> 08:46.708
Yeah, come on,
here, hop in!

08:46.800 --> 08:48.472
Okay. Cool.
Yeah. Uh...

08:49.280 --> 08:51.635
Okay. Do you need any help?

08:59.360 --> 09:01.954
Sorry. I'm sorry.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.350
I'm still just totally blown
away that you're actually here.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.909
Yeah.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.798
Um, where are we going?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.675
Oh! Yeah!
Uh, we're going to, uh, to work.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.597
Work at the, uh,
at the bar.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.558
Oh, you work at the bar
with your dad! That's nice.

09:20.640 --> 09:24.110
Uh, well, no, it's...
It's mine now.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.237
Yeah. My, uh,
dad passed away.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.390
Oh, I'm sorry, Oscar.
I'm really sorry.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.038
It's all right.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.872
Oh, when did that happen?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.070
Uh, a few years ago.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.229
He was a really nice guy.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.389
Yeah.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.480
How's your mom?

09:38.520 --> 09:39.840
I bet that was
really hard on her.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.072
Uh, well, she died
long before that.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.999
Jesus. I'm so sorry.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.875
Yeah. You were still
living here.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.308
Don't you remember?
You went to the funeral.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.549
Huh.
It looks different than I remember.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.999
Oh, well, yeah.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.355
No, I did some
renovations a while back.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.880
Yeah, less and less people
started showing up,

10:10.960 --> 10:13.110
and I think the whole
country-western thing

10:13.200 --> 10:15.350
was scaring
people away, honestly.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.278
Wow! Hey!

10:23.240 --> 10:24.878
I like it.
Yeah?

10:24.960 --> 10:26.109
Yeah.
Yeah.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.589
Yeah. Thought you would.
It's more refined, right?

10:30.560 --> 10:33.233
Yeah, I just wanted something
that had a little bit more

10:33.360 --> 10:37.148
of a classic-feeling bar.
You know?

10:37.880 --> 10:40.136
Something that doesn't necessarily
need to rely on a theme

10:40.160 --> 10:41.878
or anything like that.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.118
Well, it has a theme.
No, it doesn't.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.197
No, I mean, it's got a vibe,
yeah, for sure,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.191
but, I mean,
it doesn't have a theme.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.794
No. What would
the theme be? Like, a bar?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.312
Hey, didn't this
used to be bigger?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.277
Yeah. Yeah.
Good memory. Yeah.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.231
I just ended up
shutting that half down.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.456
You know, we didn't need it,
with the people and everything.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.549
But it's all right.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.096
Got a buddy that comes in every
now and then that helps me out.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.401
Most of the time I can just
fend for myself, though, so...

11:08.120 --> 11:10.350
You all right?
Hmm?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.675
You're just...
Oh! Yeah.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.230
It's this nervous tic I have.
I get this itch right here...

11:16.360 --> 11:17.456
You look
like a monkey. Yeah.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.754
I look like a monkey.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.589
So what?
You're Oscar's secret...

11:23.520 --> 11:24.736
No.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.398
We don't know
anything about you.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.074
We were, uh, friends
in elementary school,

11:29.160 --> 11:30.673
and then I moved
to New York,

11:30.760 --> 11:32.193
and I've lived there
ever since.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.510
Now I'm just...
I'm visiting for a few days.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.993
You know what
your problem is?

11:38.880 --> 11:40.029
What's my problem?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.190
I used to live in New York,
too, a while back.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.430
I worked there for a few
months in a print shop.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.034
Then I met this guy
who'd lost his passport

11:47.120 --> 11:48.256
and he couldn't afford
a new one,

11:48.280 --> 11:49.554
so I decided
to help him out,

11:49.640 --> 11:50.959
let him stay with me
for a while.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.799
After a week of
living with him,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.711
I find out the police
are looking for him

11:54.800 --> 11:56.119
because he beat up
his boyfriend.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.032
Hey, Garth?
Sorry, what's my problem?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.235
What's your problem?

12:01.960 --> 12:03.816
Yeah, you asked me did I
know what my problem was,

12:03.840 --> 12:05.840
and then you told a story,
and I don't know what...

12:05.960 --> 12:07.200
What does it have to do
with me?

12:07.480 --> 12:10.472
I didn't ask you that.
Did I?

12:10.560 --> 12:13.028
Yeah, you did. Sorry.
He has this problem

12:13.120 --> 12:15.759
that whenever he meets someone new,
he gets very eager

12:15.880 --> 12:17.074
and starts babbling a lot.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.388
That is totally
not true.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.840
Sorry.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.592
So, what do you think
of Mainhead?

12:29.680 --> 12:31.193
Has it changed a lot?

12:33.440 --> 12:35.715
To tell you the truth,
I have no fucking idea.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.274
Right back here.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.431
Holy shit!

12:47.520 --> 12:49.750
Oscar, the horses!
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.515
Oh, my God, you kept this part
the way it was! It's awesome!

12:54.120 --> 12:56.588
Oscar, why don't you use it?
It's so great!

12:56.680 --> 12:58.016
Well, I told you,
I didn't really need it.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.160
Didn't really
need it?

12:59.200 --> 13:01.668
He ran out of money in the
middle of the renovation.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.438
Couldn't afford
to finish it.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.790
This is his
dark little secret.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.950
Like a lower back tattoo.
Hey!

13:10.960 --> 13:12.632
- Oscar!
- Yeah.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.188
You're nuts.
This place is magical.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.589
It's... Because it's not
literal anymore!

13:17.680 --> 13:18.829
It's like...

13:18.920 --> 13:20.717
It's actually ironic now.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.114
Want a Tic Tac?
Why, does my breath smell?

13:25.360 --> 13:27.032
- Hey, Oscar!
- Mmm-hmm.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.033
You got any teabags?

13:29.160 --> 13:30.639
Why, do you want
a cup of tea?

13:30.720 --> 13:31.835
No, I want a teabag.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.518
With the little string and the
paper doohickey at the end...

13:35.600 --> 13:37.960
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept.
What do you need it for?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.760
I'm gonna do a trick.
I don't know your name.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.395
Uh, Joel.
Gloria.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.760
Why do they
always do that?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.320
What?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.277
They always introduce you
to all the guys

13:50.360 --> 13:52.316
except for
the good-looking ones.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.435
One.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.230
Oh, it's like a fucking Wes Anderson
movie in here, Oscar,

14:03.360 --> 14:04.952
I love it!

14:05.040 --> 14:06.632
I wish the songs
were better.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.913
When we were kids,
back in school,

14:12.120 --> 14:14.953
every year they'd have this short
story contest in the spring,

14:15.120 --> 14:17.554
and Gloria here would always win!

14:17.640 --> 14:19.437
- Always!
- Oh, come on!

14:19.520 --> 14:20.953
My stories
were terrible.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.632
Oh, yeah? Well...

14:22.720 --> 14:24.278
Mmm,

14:24.360 --> 14:27.432
apparently they were
better than mine, so...

14:29.120 --> 14:30.872
I'm gonna get more booze.
I didn't know that

14:30.960 --> 14:32.439
you wanted
to be a writer.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.438
You...

14:34.560 --> 14:36.869
No, I didn't. That...
You missed the point, Dumdum.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.757
I'm not...
She's the writer... I'm...

14:38.840 --> 14:41.070
I'm not a writer.
I mean, I don't, like...

14:41.160 --> 14:42.752
I don't write fiction.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.638
I write articles for
an online magazine.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.640
Oh, they're on
the Internet!

14:47.680 --> 14:49.875
Yeah, they are.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.552
Well, that's...
That's cool!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.232
It is. Yeah.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.788
Write down the address,
and then I could check it out.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.153
Oh... Okay.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.159
Uh-huh...

15:02.520 --> 15:04.158
Yeah.
There we go.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.558
Sorry.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.198
Hey! What the hell's
wrong with you?

15:18.840 --> 15:20.336
Huh? Am I gonna have to
kick your ass again?

15:20.360 --> 15:21.918
Oscar, nothing happened.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.320
Please. Spare me. Okay?
It's your first night back in town,

15:24.360 --> 15:25.416
somebody had to go
fuck it up...

15:25.440 --> 15:26.536
Easy. We've all been
drinking, okay?

15:26.560 --> 15:27.959
It's fun.
We're just having fun.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.473
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened!

15:29.560 --> 15:30.629
Yeah...

15:30.720 --> 15:32.756
What's going on?
Nothing!

15:37.360 --> 15:38.679
Jesus Christ.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.479
What happened?

16:21.720 --> 16:22.948
Shit.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.236
Oh.

17:24.599 --> 17:25.669
Ow!

17:29.400 --> 17:30.515
What the...

17:34.480 --> 17:35.629
Hi.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.233
Oh, hey, sis, what's up?

17:38.320 --> 17:39.958
No, I'm okay. I'm just...

17:41.480 --> 17:43.675
I'm okay. Yeah.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.736
No, I haven't heard anything.
What are you talking about?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.159
What?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.470
Oh, come on. I mean,
that's gotta be like a...

17:52.200 --> 17:55.112
It sounds like an Internet
prank or something, right?

17:55.200 --> 17:58.829
It's like
a viral hoax? Right?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.233
What?

18:04.160 --> 18:05.593
Oh, my... Oh, my...

18:05.680 --> 18:07.096
Okay, you know,
I need both my hands.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.031
I gotta call you back.
Okay, bye.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.314
Oh, my God!

18:11.480 --> 18:12.913
Holy shit.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.951
Oh, my God.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.790
Hello?
Um, is this a good time to talk?

19:01.880 --> 19:03.950
I mean, are you...
Are you busy?

19:04.080 --> 19:06.674
Yeah, I'm fine. Just got home.
What's wrong?

19:06.760 --> 19:09.877
What's wrong?
Oh, my God, Tim.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.638
I just looked at the news,
and I...

19:13.720 --> 19:15.039
I think I'm in shock.

19:15.120 --> 19:20.956
I mean, a giant monster just
materialized over Seoul.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.633
Out of nowhere!
I mean...

19:22.720 --> 19:24.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's crazy.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.076
But, Gloria, that happened,
like, nine hours ago.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.718
You're just hearing
about this?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.560
Yeah.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.471
Well, what have you been
doing all day?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.592
I... Um...

19:38.440 --> 19:42.991
I've been, like, you know,
doing stuff around the house.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.833
Hey, what are you...
What are you getting at, Tim?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.240
I'm worried about you,
that's all.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.896
You said you were going home
to figure things out,

19:48.920 --> 19:50.148
to get
your life together...

19:50.240 --> 19:52.390
That is exactly what I'm doing!

19:52.480 --> 19:54.630
Gloria, if you're still out
drinking all night,

19:54.720 --> 19:56.870
you need professional help.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.871
You know, we've been
here before, and...

20:03.840 --> 20:06.718
...whether this shocking
phenomenon is considered an attack

20:06.800 --> 20:08.199
or a natural disaster.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.714
Meanwhile, the global
state of emergency continues,

20:11.800 --> 20:13.153
with stock markets plunging.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.475
Thanks.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.708
So far, this is
the best footage we have

20:18.800 --> 20:21.155
of the creature
vanishing into thin air.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.639
The unprecedented nature of...

20:23.720 --> 20:25.199
Did you get that tingle?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.736
When you know
you're watching something

20:27.760 --> 20:29.376
that's gonna change
the course of history?

20:29.400 --> 20:31.216
Stephen Hawking has been the
most outspoken among scientists

20:31.240 --> 20:33.515
in raising the question
of whether we need to revise

20:33.600 --> 20:37.036
our entire understanding
of the laws of physics.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.510
With hundreds of specialists
already converging on Seoul,

20:40.600 --> 20:42.750
initial scientific analysis
has raised concerns...

20:42.840 --> 20:44.398
All those
innocent victims.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.799
And here we are,

20:45.880 --> 20:48.758
just thinking how lucky
we are to be watching.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.554
...this, and the high level
of air contamination

20:52.640 --> 20:55.074
triggered by the destruction,
have accelerated

20:55.160 --> 20:58.835
the evacuation of many
affected urban areas.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.514
The UN has called for
a worldwide ceasefire,

21:01.600 --> 21:04.751
and is asking for support from
all nations able to help.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.829
The US and NATO forces
have already been dispatched

21:07.920 --> 21:09.672
to help with search
and rescue operations,

21:09.760 --> 21:13.514
as the number of injured or missing
citizens continues to climb.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.192
After the first
public statement

21:15.280 --> 21:16.793
from the South
Korean president...

22:07.600 --> 22:09.238
Uh...

22:18.640 --> 22:20.437
Hello?
Hi.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.797
Did I wake you up? No. It's okay.
What's up?

22:24.880 --> 22:26.996
I just want to
talk to you.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.672
I just woke up,

22:28.760 --> 22:31.911
and, um, I thought you'd
be on your way to work,

22:32.000 --> 22:33.433
so I wanted to talk
to you.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.795
Gloria, Gloria,
you're drunk.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.996
I'm not talking to you
when you're drunk.

22:39.840 --> 22:44.436
I'm not drunk.
I'm talking to you.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.075
I've been, uh, getting
stuff for the house.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.798
I bought, uh...

22:52.960 --> 22:54.200
I bought
an inflatable mattress.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.680
I've got to get ready for work, okay?
I'll talk to you later.

22:57.800 --> 22:58.869
Shit.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.589
Shit!

23:38.520 --> 23:39.555
Hi.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.515
Hi.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.999
I brought you a TV.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.832
Careful.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.149
Oh, shit.
Uh, I just gotta...

23:53.240 --> 23:56.198
I mean, I think we should
probably put it in here.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.157
Yeah.
Sorry. Ugh...

23:58.240 --> 23:59.992
Um...

24:00.320 --> 24:03.357
Yeah, sorry, it's kind of, uh,
a mess in here.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.716
This is, uh, the only place I can
get Wi-Fi without a password, so...

24:07.280 --> 24:08.554
Um, what did you say?
What...

24:08.640 --> 24:10.631
I didn't say anything.
Oh, okay.

24:11.520 --> 24:12.919
Why don't we pop it
over here?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.718
Got the outlet
and everything.

24:14.840 --> 24:18.549
Okay. You want me
to, uh, do anything, or...

24:18.640 --> 24:20.551
No! Honestly. I'm good.
I know what I'm doing.

24:20.640 --> 24:21.776
I like doing
this kind of stuff.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.233
Okay. Thank you.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.639
Oh, I gotta say,
this is a...

24:24.720 --> 24:26.119
This is
a pretty nice surprise.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.592
What, the TV?
Yeah.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.513
We talked about this last night.
Don't you remember?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.511
Yeah.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.233
Yeah. Yeah.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.359
Did the monster come back?

24:39.720 --> 24:43.395
Uh, yeah.
It attacked Seoul again.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.038
What?
But not as bad.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.476
You know,
the thing appeared,

24:47.560 --> 24:49.551
the monster,
in the, uh, same place,

24:49.640 --> 24:51.039
but it just stood there

24:51.120 --> 24:54.317
and, like, made a bunch of
weird hand gestures. I dunno.

24:54.720 --> 24:58.269
But it did destroy a few buildings
and some people got hurt,

24:58.360 --> 24:59.918
but, again,
nothing like last time.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.759
What time did it happen?

25:03.480 --> 25:05.471
8:05.
The same...

25:05.560 --> 25:07.676
Exact same time.
That's weird.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.797
Same time as yesterday, and
same time as, you know,

25:10.880 --> 25:11.995
the other time
it showed up.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.274
What other time?

25:15.080 --> 25:16.195
You...

25:18.480 --> 25:21.438
I'll show you. Yeah.
Yeah... Yeah. Please.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.638
Can't believe
you haven't seen this.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.594
This is, uh...

25:28.400 --> 25:29.435
Yeah.

25:30.840 --> 25:31.880
It was, like,
25 years ago.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.315
Oh, my gosh!

25:33.400 --> 25:34.616
It appeared and disappeared,
exact same...

25:34.640 --> 25:36.676
8:05, right on the dot.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.416
Back then, everyone just
thought it was a hoax.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.238
But, yeah, it's
the only photo they have.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.914
Not the greatest quality,
but, you know, you can tell...

25:45.040 --> 25:47.270
Whoa... it's it from
the silhouette, right?

25:47.360 --> 25:48.588
Seoul, too?

25:48.680 --> 25:50.238
Uh, yeah,
that was in Seoul, yeah.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.998
Well, that's a shame.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.354
Why do you say that?

25:53.440 --> 25:54.839
Well, you know, like...

25:55.480 --> 25:57.072
If the monster
is only attacking Seoul,

25:57.200 --> 26:00.476
then all the rest of the world
will stop caring, you know?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.630
Like all the ceasefires
that happened, they...

26:02.720 --> 26:05.996
They'll just end.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.753
Hmm.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.558
So you don't remember anything
we talked about last night, huh?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.036
I got really melodramatic,
didn't I?

26:17.120 --> 26:21.716
Well, uh, you told me that you
weren't really on a vacation.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.916
That you've been looking
for a job for a year,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.468
and you've been living
with your boyfriend, Tim,

26:26.560 --> 26:28.278
and, uh,
it didn't work out,

26:28.360 --> 26:29.736
and since you didn't
have any money,

26:29.760 --> 26:31.456
you decided to move back
here for a little while.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.869
For the record, I figured out
that you were broke on my own,

26:33.960 --> 26:35.336
so you don't have to
feel bad about...

26:35.360 --> 26:38.830
Oh, well. Congratulations.
Is there anything else?

26:38.920 --> 26:41.593
I told you that if you wanted
to give me a hand at the bar,

26:41.680 --> 26:42.715
you're more than welcome.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.656
You know, make a little money
while you're staying here.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.910
What did I say?
You said yes.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.795
Yeah.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.016
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
asked you when you were drunk.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.976
That's bad timing by me... No.
What are you talking about?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.594
That's such a nice thing to do.
Figured I'd offer, I'm sorry.

26:57.720 --> 27:00.598
But, I mean,
do you need help at the bar?

27:01.360 --> 27:02.873
If this mess
keeps going on, yeah,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.456
yeah, I'll definitely
need help at the bar.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.799
People gotta drink.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.872
Okay, I'll tell you what.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.473
I'll come to work
at the bar

27:11.000 --> 27:15.232
if you agree that we clean
up the western side.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.158
Mmm-hmm.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
All right, you're hired!

27:19.880 --> 27:21.029
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.156
Country side
is gonna open!

27:23.240 --> 27:25.231
Make it official. Boom.
Thank you.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.874
Uh, start at 5:00? Tonight?

27:26.960 --> 27:28.109
Great.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.536
All right.
Well, there we have it.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.391
Hey.
Yeah.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.913
Uh...

27:35.200 --> 27:36.200
Thank you.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.920
Oh. Yeah. Of course.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.715
You need a sofa.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.471
Huh? What?

27:50.560 --> 27:53.313
You should get a sofa for in here,
so you can watch, you know...

27:53.440 --> 27:55.510
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.
Hang out.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.435
All right. You want me
to pick you up later?

27:58.520 --> 28:01.432
That'd be great! Thank you.
Cool. Can do.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.192
Thank you!

28:03.280 --> 28:04.918
Mmm-hmm.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.314
Perfect.
Okay.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.949
The impact of the creature's
appearance has been felt worldwide.

28:18.040 --> 28:22.238
Additionally, a large number of
humanitarian forces are arriving in Seoul

28:22.320 --> 28:25.198
to help with rescue
and recovery efforts.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.431
A coalition of religious members
have lent their support

28:28.560 --> 28:30.198
and plan to visit
affected areas.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.951
Despite the lack
of recent attacks,

29:35.040 --> 29:36.951
the city remains
on high alert.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.871
As there seems to be
no discernible pattern

29:38.960 --> 29:42.032
to the location of the monster's
appearance or path of destruction,

29:42.120 --> 29:43.678
the entire city of Seoul

29:43.800 --> 29:46.109
and its surrounding suburbs
are on high alert.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.200
See, I don't think
it's alive.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.949
What do you mean?

29:51.040 --> 29:54.669
I mean,
it's not an animal.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.149
It's like a machine,

29:57.240 --> 30:00.630
and it's being operated by
remote control or something.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.789
Mmm.

30:01.880 --> 30:05.475
Do you ever notice how
it just keeps moving,

30:05.880 --> 30:07.711
destroying everything
in its path,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.239
but it never looks down?

30:11.400 --> 30:13.868
If you were walking,
surrounded by buildings

30:14.040 --> 30:17.157
up to your waist
or your shoulder,

30:17.240 --> 30:20.232
wouldn't you look around
to see where you were going?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.631
Even if you wanna
destroy everything,

30:23.720 --> 30:27.759
it makes no sense to keep
staring straight ahead

30:27.840 --> 30:29.353
if everything is below you.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.159
Hey. You okay?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.195
This is the
creature's third appearance.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.679
Surprisingly...

32:03.760 --> 32:06.069
...there were no reported
casualties or property damage,

32:06.160 --> 32:09.311
as the monster hasn't moved from the
spot of its initial appearance...

32:34.120 --> 32:35.736
Despite the confusion caused

32:35.760 --> 32:37.318
by the creature's
last appearance,

32:37.400 --> 32:39.550
NATO, the UN
and coalition forces

32:39.640 --> 32:41.198
remain on high alert.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.197
In a statement...
Ah!

32:44.440 --> 32:46.396
...military forces
will be ready to strike

32:46.480 --> 32:48.391
if the monster appears again.
What the...

32:48.480 --> 32:51.074
What the...
I don't understand...

32:51.160 --> 32:53.913
Come on... No, no...

32:54.000 --> 32:57.515
Come on! Ah!

32:57.640 --> 32:59.376
The inability
of the government to

32:59.400 --> 33:01.994
evacuate its citizens quickly
enough has forced the council

33:02.080 --> 33:04.514
to model the potential
civilian casualties involved

33:04.600 --> 33:07.068
in moving forward
with the operation.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.392
This move has caused
a massive outcry from

33:09.480 --> 33:11.232
humanitarian organizations

33:11.320 --> 33:12.958
around the world.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.158
Okay.

33:18.440 --> 33:20.271
Okay.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
Hey.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.109
Hi! Fine.
How are you doing?

33:29.200 --> 33:31.156
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.437
I was just, um...
You know, my tone.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.317
I've just been
lecturing you a lot,

33:36.400 --> 33:39.631
and I just haven't even really asked,
you know, if you're okay.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.988
I'm fine.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.680
I'm not trying to pry
or anything, I'm just, um...

33:43.760 --> 33:46.752
Don't really know what
you're actually doing there.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.199
What I'm actually doing?

33:49.280 --> 33:50.280
I'm... It...

33:50.400 --> 33:53.358
I'm, um, working.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.908
Working?
Yeah. Yeah!

33:56.000 --> 33:58.275
I'm working in a bar.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.351
It belongs to a friend
of mine from school,

34:00.440 --> 34:03.193
and, um,
he hired me part-time,

34:03.280 --> 34:05.077
and I am a waitress.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.470
You're a waitress?
Yeah.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.114
Um...

34:09.199 --> 34:10.268
But...

34:11.280 --> 34:12.998
Hold on.
Gloria?

34:16.639 --> 34:18.630
Oscar.
Brought the sofa.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.630
Hi!
Hi!

34:23.120 --> 34:25.793
What? A sofa?
Yeah. You wanted a sofa.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.679
I wanted a sofa?

34:28.480 --> 34:30.550
Uh, okay, so bring it
through here.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.274
Yeah. I think it would
be good in here. Um...

34:33.360 --> 34:34.576
Say we go
against this wall here.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.237
Yeah, yeah, that'd be...

34:36.320 --> 34:37.992
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.674
A futon!

34:40.760 --> 34:41.875
Yeah, is that okay?

34:41.960 --> 34:44.679
You remember
my inflatable mattress?

34:44.760 --> 34:45.976
It has a hole
in it or something.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.856
I don't know. It deflated.
My back is killing me.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.313
Thank you! Oh, my gosh!
Yeah.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.237
Oh!

34:53.600 --> 34:54.668
That's so nice.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.998
It's good timing then, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.559
I've never seen anyone so
excited about a futon before.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.278
Highlight of my day.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.430
Well, sorry to break
up the love affair here,

35:05.520 --> 35:07.272
but we gotta go to work.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.554
No.
Yeah.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.551
Not yet, not yet!

35:10.640 --> 35:13.518
Yeah, it's time to work.
Let's go.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.839
Okay.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.512
Hold on,
I just gotta grab my phone.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
Do it!

35:22.360 --> 35:24.669
That's amazing.
I owe you big for that.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.039
All right,
so I want you to watch,

35:29.120 --> 35:30.997
because this is how
Oscar dances

35:31.080 --> 35:32.593
when he is trying
to seduce you.

35:32.680 --> 35:33.954
It was a wedding.
Right, right.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.136
Okay? This is not
my normal...

35:35.160 --> 35:38.391
Note the fingers gyrating around
the entertainment center.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.476
What are you doing?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.991
Hilarious.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.872
Hilariously accurate!

36:03.840 --> 36:08.868
So. The astronaut climbs
into the capsule.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.515
Hey, Joel, just make sure to
turn off the lights in here.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.636
Don't turn anything off
and on out front, okay?

36:13.960 --> 36:15.160
I got it!
Just forget it.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.056
Nobody's even paying attention.
Doesn't matter.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.593
- What?
- Listening to what?

36:18.680 --> 36:22.275
To the story about the astronaut!
Jesus Christ!

36:22.720 --> 36:25.029
Weren't you listening
to a word I was saying?

36:25.160 --> 36:26.673
No! Who cares
about the story?

36:26.760 --> 36:28.512
Are you gonna
do the trick, or what?

36:28.600 --> 36:31.876
I'll do the trick at the end of
the story about the astronaut.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.194
Why?

36:33.280 --> 36:36.113
If the trick's
good enough, fuck the story.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.633
But what if
the trick sucks?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.153
Fuck the story.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.159
All right.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.636
All right,
just to catch you up,

36:45.720 --> 36:48.154
blah, blah, blah,
there's an astronaut, et cetera.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.753
All right, here we go.
Showtime.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.068
Don't blow it out.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.073
Patience...

36:54.160 --> 36:55.513
Not all that interesting.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.153
Oh! Look at that!

37:00.960 --> 37:02.313
Huh.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.869
Very cool. Very cool.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.096
I feel like it would have been
better with the story, though.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.336
Are you
fucking kidding me?

37:09.360 --> 37:11.032
I need to tell
you guys something.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.632
But you have to promise that
you're not gonna tell anyone.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.870
Okay? Not a soul.
All right?

37:18.960 --> 37:22.635
This is a secret between us.
No one else can know, okay?

37:25.680 --> 37:26.999
All right.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.912
We gotta go to the park,

37:30.600 --> 37:33.068
and then I am gonna
show you guys something.

37:44.960 --> 37:45.995
All right.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.675
Okay. Uh, there's
a website called, um,

37:49.760 --> 37:51.079
"Seoul Under Attack:
Live Feed,"

37:51.160 --> 37:52.856
something like that.
You gotta find that one,

37:52.880 --> 37:56.031
and, uh, everybody
over there. Okay.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.599
Gloria, what is this?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.360
I just need everybody
to be quiet. Just go.

38:00.880 --> 38:01.949
Okay.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.679
All right.
Good, good, good.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.836
Everybody's gonna be
over there,

38:06.080 --> 38:08.799
and I am...
I'm gonna be on this side...

38:08.880 --> 38:11.235
- All right, I got it.
- Now what?

38:11.600 --> 38:13.591
You... Joel.

38:14.680 --> 38:15.680
Come on!

38:15.720 --> 38:16.869
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.711
Um... Uh, click on the window that has...
It's the river area.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.949
The third one, I think?

38:23.040 --> 38:25.315
Okay.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.788
Okay.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.429
Okay.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.990
Okay, it's gonna happen really soon,
so just wait for it.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
Wait for what?

38:44.640 --> 38:46.640
Just watch your screen
and tell me when you see it.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.308
See what?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.196
Holy shit.
All right. It's back.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.319
Do you see it?
Yeah, I got it.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.079
Is it there?
The giant monster? Yeah.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.280
Holy shit!
Gloria, you gotta see this!

39:13.720 --> 39:15.073
What is it doing?

39:15.160 --> 39:16.388
It's dancing.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.789
It's dancing, like...

39:19.520 --> 39:20.714
Holy shit.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.759
Uh, it stopped.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.949
Hi, assholes! Mwah!

39:29.360 --> 39:31.240
I'm blowing you kisses.
I am blowing you kisses!

39:32.400 --> 39:33.674
Whoa!

39:33.760 --> 39:35.955
- What the...
- Okay. How? How?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.712
Wait. This isn't happening.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.216
No, no, no.
This is not happening.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.993
This is one of those practical joke apps.
This is a joke.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.275
But, you know,
I still feel like dancing, so...

39:44.400 --> 39:46.080
Can you guess which
film this is from, huh?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.760
The fuck is going on?

39:48.120 --> 39:49.678
Do you wanna make
any requests?

39:49.760 --> 39:52.035
This does not last
that long.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.673
It's a joke.
What...

39:58.520 --> 40:00.590
What the...

40:00.800 --> 40:02.119
Ow.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.914
They're shooting
at you. Missiles.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.437
They're shooting at me?
Are you serious?

40:07.520 --> 40:09.556
Who? Where? Where?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.115
All right.
Come on, fuckers!

40:11.200 --> 40:13.316
You wanna mess with me?
Come on!

40:19.280 --> 40:20.713
Ow! What was that?

40:21.320 --> 40:22.673
A helicopter crashed.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.309
Into my head?

40:25.880 --> 40:27.154
Yeah.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.910
With, like, the pilot
and everything?

40:32.840 --> 40:33.840
Wow.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.275
All right, Gloria.
What is this? Shit.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.998
Shit. I don't want
to be here anymore.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.712
Um, I don't...
How do I get out?

40:39.800 --> 40:41.456
Which way is the river?
I don't know where it is...

40:41.480 --> 40:42.480
Hey! Gloria!

40:42.520 --> 40:43.999
I don't want to
be here anymore,

40:44.080 --> 40:45.593
can you just show me...
Holy shit!

40:45.680 --> 40:47.033
What?

40:54.400 --> 40:57.836
This is the only
footage of the attacks we have so far.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.036
It's unbelievable,
I mean, look...

41:05.400 --> 41:07.834
...trying to understand what
their lives have become.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.549
Trying to comprehend
everything they've lost.

41:26.600 --> 41:27.600
Oh, you're up.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.072
I took your keys,

41:30.560 --> 41:32.480
'cause I didn't want to
wake you when I got back.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.073
Um, I hope
that's okay. I...

41:36.600 --> 41:39.239
Also, I noticed you
didn't have any food...

41:39.320 --> 41:41.675
How many people
did I kill?

41:45.160 --> 41:46.275
Um...

41:46.960 --> 41:48.029
Give me the paper.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.509
Wait, no, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Gloria, listen...

41:50.600 --> 41:52.320
Can you please tell me
how many people died?

41:55.080 --> 41:57.674
How about I fix you something to eat,
and then we can...

41:57.760 --> 41:59.478
We can just talk about
it calmly, you know?

42:02.440 --> 42:03.759
Um...

42:04.680 --> 42:05.680
Not many.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.715
All right?

42:09.440 --> 42:11.271
Fuck!

42:11.600 --> 42:12.669
What are you doing?

42:12.800 --> 42:15.872
"Not many"? How many does
"not many" mean?

42:15.960 --> 42:17.256
Gloria. Okay, you gotta
calm down.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.136
Does it mean 100 people?
Does it mean 200 people?

42:19.160 --> 42:20.456
Gloria!
What does "not many" mean?

42:20.480 --> 42:21.696
I gotta tell someone.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.336
I gotta turn myself in.
Hey! You gotta calm down.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.429
I gotta turn myself in...

42:24.520 --> 42:26.096
Wait, now, hold on!
I gotta tell them what happened...

42:26.120 --> 42:27.576
Yeah, but you don't know
what happened.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.160
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!
I killed a shitload of people

42:30.240 --> 42:32.470
because I was acting like
a drunk idiot! Again!

42:34.920 --> 42:36.797
Hey! Gloria! Hey! Hey!

42:37.320 --> 42:38.514
That's not what happened!

42:39.960 --> 42:41.234
What?

42:43.960 --> 42:46.633
Well, not the only thing
that happened.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.878
Pretty sure that's me.

43:04.720 --> 43:09.157
We can see streets littered with
debris here after the attack.

43:09.240 --> 43:13.153
There appear to be several
emergency response vehicles...

43:13.240 --> 43:15.708
They're so freaked out by the
giant robot suddenly appearing

43:15.840 --> 43:17.520
that they're not talking
about the dancing.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.513
Okay. Okay.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.950
Had you ever been in the
park at 8:05 before?

43:25.080 --> 43:27.435
Mmm... I can't recall.
I don't think so.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.511
You don't think so?
You don't... Come on.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.670
Been in the park at that
time in the morning?

43:32.040 --> 43:33.632
No. No, definitely not.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.154
So this could've happened at any
time during all these years.

43:36.240 --> 43:39.277
Yeah. It's crazy that it only
happens to the two of us.

43:39.360 --> 43:42.432
And the first time my monster
appeared was when we were kids?

43:42.520 --> 43:44.351
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
Excuse me? More coffee?

43:44.960 --> 43:46.188
No... No...

43:46.800 --> 43:48.199
I'm good. Thanks.

43:49.720 --> 43:50.896
Do you think
she heard something?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.296
I think she heard something.
Heard what?

43:52.320 --> 43:53.833
That we're the ones
destroying Seoul?

43:54.560 --> 43:55.680
Shh! Shut up!
Don't say that!

43:55.720 --> 43:56.755
Calm down!

43:57.280 --> 43:58.696
Even if she heard you,
she'd have no idea

43:58.720 --> 44:00.073
what we're
talking about, okay?

44:00.160 --> 44:04.233
I just... I think we need to keep it cool,
be careful, okay?

44:04.320 --> 44:05.912
People are looking
at us.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.797
People are
looking at us!

44:10.560 --> 44:12.915
Hi. I'm the robot.
She's the monster.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.240
He's...

44:16.320 --> 44:18.470
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!

44:18.560 --> 44:20.357
Whoa! Hey! Stop.
I'm sorry.

44:20.440 --> 44:23.398
Okay? Just calm down.
Now, what were you saying?

44:23.520 --> 44:25.920
You were talking about the first
time your monster showed up.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.271
Okay. What were we doing
back then?

44:29.080 --> 44:31.116
Um, going to school.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.437
No. What were we doing
at that exact time?

44:33.520 --> 44:35.112
We were going to school.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.509
Yeah. 8:05 is when we would
be walking to the bus stop.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.749
That's right!

44:39.600 --> 44:42.034
Yeah, but I don't remember
walking through that park...

44:42.120 --> 44:44.120
In fact, that wasn't even
a park when we were kids.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.636
You know? Remember?
It was that fenced-off area...

44:46.720 --> 44:47.800
It was a construction site.

44:47.880 --> 44:49.598
Yeah, with, like,
garbage and trees...

44:49.680 --> 44:51.176
But it was,
like, dirt, it wasn't...

44:51.200 --> 44:53.634
- Mmm-hmm.
- Right!

44:59.960 --> 45:01.234
Do you still wanna confess?

45:03.160 --> 45:04.718
No.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.234
I feel terrible,
but I'm, you know...

45:08.280 --> 45:11.078
Not like confessing
is gonna do any good.

45:11.160 --> 45:12.354
No, that's true.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.475
Actually, there's nothing
we can do.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.314
There's nothing we can do.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.999
Yes, there is.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.439
Boom.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.233
Did he think
it was weird?

45:51.920 --> 45:54.957
No. No, not at all.
Nah, he's an old friend.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.280
I've been coming here
for years.

45:56.360 --> 46:00.114
Look, he even gave us free food.
Nice, huh?

46:01.960 --> 46:03.837
Okay.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.192
So, uh, where do you
want to meet later?

46:08.640 --> 46:10.756
Oh! Uh... You know what,
man, it's your night off.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.056
You should probably
get some rest.

46:12.080 --> 46:13.593
I can do this.
It's fine.

46:13.680 --> 46:15.716
Are you kidding me?
I'm not gonna be able to sleep.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.313
Me neither.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.878
I guess it was the
wrong time to be funny.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.473
When I made a humorous allusion
halfway through a sentence.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.513
Um, thought it was funny
at the time,

46:34.600 --> 46:35.696
and, you know,
it seemed harmless,

46:35.720 --> 46:37.995
because it was
a play on words.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.496
A play on words is funny
'cause of how it sounds,

46:39.520 --> 46:40.600
not 'cause of what
it means.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.797
They didn't fire me,

46:44.880 --> 46:47.394
but when they started downsizing,
I was the first to go.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.630
Oh, you jerk,
you already knew.

46:56.440 --> 46:57.839
Yes. I'm sorry.

46:57.960 --> 47:00.190
Ugh. Why didn't you
tell me?

47:00.280 --> 47:02.256
Why are you letting me, like...

47:02.280 --> 47:03.872
Why? I don't...
...my past?

47:03.960 --> 47:05.176
I didn't want you
to think I was creepy,

47:05.200 --> 47:06.553
like I'm some
sort of stalker...

47:06.600 --> 47:08.272
Well, it's too late for that.
You know?

47:08.400 --> 47:10.834
Yeah.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.640
So you've been following
me all these years?

47:13.880 --> 47:15.313
Of course I have.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.512
Somebody actually
made it out of here

47:17.600 --> 47:19.113
and did something
special for once.

47:25.040 --> 47:26.678
You know, this place
is not bad at all.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.716
You've got your friends,
the bar's cool...

47:29.800 --> 47:31.358
Yeah. No, that's true.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.556
I think some of the girls
have their eyes on you.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.190
Some of the ladies.

47:36.280 --> 47:37.508
You don't say.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.080
I was actually this close to getting
married about six years ago.

47:41.520 --> 47:42.669
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

47:43.600 --> 47:47.070
I, uh, asked this girl
to move in with me,

47:47.160 --> 47:49.071
you know, just to see
how things would work.

47:49.160 --> 47:51.469
Her and her baby, actually.

47:51.560 --> 47:56.076
And, uh, it didn't last.
She got bored real quick.

47:56.160 --> 47:58.435
I'm sorry.

47:58.560 --> 47:59.993
I don't blame her.

48:00.840 --> 48:02.432
It's hard
not to get bored.

48:03.440 --> 48:07.513
I mean, there are ways,
but none of them are healthy.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.256
Hell, look what
had to happen

48:13.280 --> 48:14.920
for things to get
interesting around here.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.753
Giants attacking
South Korea.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.999
No. I mean you.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.868
What's that?
Sirens in Seoul.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.952
Announcing I might
show up.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.512
Then go.

48:39.600 --> 48:40.794
Wait, what are you doing?

48:40.880 --> 48:42.816
What do you mean? I thought we
were going to do this together?

48:42.840 --> 48:44.720
No, Oscar, this is my thing.
This is my problem.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.600
I'm confused. Why did you ask
me to come out here, then?

48:47.680 --> 48:49.557
Well... I didn't...
You offered!

48:49.640 --> 48:51.676
Can you just let me do it?
Please, just...

48:52.320 --> 48:53.673
Yeah, okay.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.878
Oh, hold on.

49:10.920 --> 49:13.354
Okay. Yeah, you're there.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.429
Okay. It's clear.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.840
Are you sure?

49:46.440 --> 49:47.555
Yeah, I'm sure.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.439
You're fine. Go ahead.

50:15.040 --> 50:17.838
The message is clear.
"I'm sorry.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.469
"It was a mistake.
It won't happen again."

50:21.560 --> 50:24.154
This shocking gesture
has been met by skepticism

50:24.240 --> 50:26.276
from government
and military leaders.

50:26.600 --> 50:30.070
Just like I thought!
It's a good monster.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.832
It's been a good guy
the whole time.

50:31.920 --> 50:34.593
This confirms the creature is intelligent,
understands language,

50:34.680 --> 50:37.672
at least Korean, and is
eager to communicate.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.877
Many residents have decided
to return to their homes.

50:40.960 --> 50:43.110
The people of Seoul
have remained resilient...

50:47.800 --> 50:49.119
Congratulations.

50:50.280 --> 50:53.113
I get that you don't trust
the translators on the Internet,

50:53.240 --> 50:55.674
- but your friend, the one at the restaurant.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:55.760 --> 50:59.196
Don't you think that he was
just a little blown away

50:59.280 --> 51:03.876
when the monster wrote exactly
what you told him to?

51:03.960 --> 51:06.599
I asked him to translate other
phrases too, to throw him off.

51:06.680 --> 51:08.176
What kind of phrases?
What does that matter?

51:08.200 --> 51:09.792
What did you tell him
they were for?

51:10.160 --> 51:11.309
For tattoos.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.709
Who gets a tattoo
that says,

51:13.840 --> 51:16.798
"I'm sorry, it was a mistake,
it won't happen again"?

51:16.880 --> 51:20.589
That's how you beg
your wife for forgiveness

51:20.720 --> 51:22.597
after you've cheated on her!

51:22.680 --> 51:24.989
I've seen weirder tattoos,
I'm just... Yeah!

51:25.360 --> 51:28.193
I'm lost, and I gotta pee.
All right, good.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.229
Let us know how
that all turns out.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.276
Yeah, I mean, I see
your point there. Yeah.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.472
No, no, no, I got it.
You tattoo it backwards.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.256
Okay. Why backwards?
I don't understand.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.430
That way, you're the only
one who can read it.

51:40.520 --> 51:41.873
You're saying it
to yourself.

51:41.960 --> 51:44.349
And why are you asking
yourself for forgiveness?

51:47.360 --> 51:48.679
For getting a tattoo?

51:53.320 --> 51:55.072
Hi.
Hey.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.115
What are you...
Shh.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.193
Where do you live?

51:59.280 --> 52:00.315
What?

52:00.880 --> 52:02.279
What's your address?

52:18.200 --> 52:19.713
Hey.
Hi.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.232
Come on in.
Thanks.

52:24.720 --> 52:25.994
The guys still there?

52:26.120 --> 52:27.536
Yeah, they were
still there when I left.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.551
They were still partying.
Thank you.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.475
They, uh...

52:33.400 --> 52:34.913
They won't think
it's weird?

52:35.240 --> 52:36.309
No, why would they?

52:36.400 --> 52:38.436
They don't know
anything about this.

52:38.880 --> 52:40.950
Neither do I.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.273
Mmm-hmm.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.560
Do you want something
to drink, or...

52:52.640 --> 52:53.675
No?

53:04.640 --> 53:06.039
Comfy?

53:18.760 --> 53:20.478
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

53:20.560 --> 53:22.437
Did you... Was that...

53:22.560 --> 53:25.472
I'm sorry. I thought,
with you coming over here, and...

53:26.480 --> 53:27.754
I'm kidding.

53:32.240 --> 53:34.037
I'm so happy to
hear you say that.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.800
I just thought I had screwed it all
up again, my heart's pounding...

53:36.840 --> 53:38.159
Okay.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.353
Oh! Oh!

54:33.560 --> 54:34.834
Joel!

54:34.920 --> 54:36.600
Wake up, wake up!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

54:36.720 --> 54:38.039
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Ah!

54:40.920 --> 54:42.114
Now!
Ah!

54:47.600 --> 54:48.600
Oscar!

54:50.520 --> 54:51.953
- Gloria!
- What are you doing?

54:52.040 --> 54:53.268
Are you out of your mind?

54:53.360 --> 54:55.112
What? We're just
having a little fun!

54:55.200 --> 54:57.350
Grr!

55:00.560 --> 55:01.879
Hey, Joel.

55:05.320 --> 55:06.878
Hey, Joel.

55:08.880 --> 55:10.677
Oscar! Oscar!

55:10.760 --> 55:12.478
Get out of there!
Turn around,

55:12.560 --> 55:15.472
walk toward the river
and keep walking! Now!

55:15.560 --> 55:17.039
Wait, wait, wait.
Calm down!

55:17.120 --> 55:19.315
I'm not hurting anyone, okay?
We already checked.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.628
We're not
fucking idiots.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.956
Shit! Oh, shit.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.153
Be careful!
Aw, come on.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.896
You're the one that killed a
shitload of people, not me.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.148
Spare me the lectures.

55:49.640 --> 55:50.914
Get out.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.112
I don't fucking want to.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.519
Yeah, okay.

56:29.120 --> 56:30.120
Oh, hey.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.592
Gonna need you to
go in early today.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.716
Start cleaning up the
western side of the bar.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.836
If you're not
too tired, obviously.

56:37.360 --> 56:40.158
Why are you asking me
to do that now, Oscar?

56:41.240 --> 56:43.674
What are you talking about?
You offered.

56:50.840 --> 56:52.296
After what happened this morning

56:52.320 --> 56:53.753
with the surprising
turn of events,

56:54.200 --> 56:56.794
the theory shared by many
has been confirmed.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.314
The two creatures
are not on the same side.

56:59.400 --> 57:01.231
And the creature we first
considered a threat

57:01.320 --> 57:04.073
could very well be the one
protecting the city of Seoul.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.479
As is to be expected,

57:05.560 --> 57:07.869
social media websites are
talking about nothing else.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.595
This is today's
most watched viral video.

57:16.560 --> 57:18.118
Mmm.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.233
In other news,

57:20.320 --> 57:23.517
the monster and robot have
developed a large following.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.433
People are flocking to Seoul
from all over the world

57:26.520 --> 57:29.671
in hopes of catching a real-life
glimpse of the phenomenon.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.879
Staying late
tonight, right?

57:51.360 --> 57:52.395
Really, uh...

57:54.320 --> 57:55.958
It's really well done,
actually.

57:56.040 --> 57:58.554
You know?

57:58.840 --> 58:00.910
The more times I watch it,
the funnier it gets.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.391
Hey, Oscar,
why don't you give it a rest?

58:04.880 --> 58:06.029
What's the problem?

58:06.560 --> 58:08.118
What, I can't think
it's funny?

58:08.200 --> 58:09.616
You don't think I know
how to laugh at myself?

58:09.640 --> 58:11.392
No, no, no.
I just, you know...

58:12.360 --> 58:13.416
You've seen it
1,000 times.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.510
I think you might be
exaggerating a little. Right?

58:16.080 --> 58:17.080
Uh, excuse me.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.513
No, no, no. Hold on.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.471
I'm not the one that's
watched it 1,000 times.

58:20.600 --> 58:21.749
Everyone else has.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.896
You know? I mean, look how
many hits this thing has.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.229
There's not this many people
alive in the world. Look.

58:26.320 --> 58:28.240
Okay! Okay, you're right.
Never mind. Never mind.

58:29.080 --> 58:31.071
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

58:39.760 --> 58:41.796
Projection screen is down.

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
What?

58:43.920 --> 58:45.114
Screen. It's still down.

58:45.200 --> 58:48.033
If you leave it like that
overnight, it'll warp.

58:49.320 --> 58:51.038
Are you asking me
to close it?

58:51.400 --> 58:53.709
I am asking you
to do your job.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.074
Well, um...

58:57.800 --> 58:59.233
I got it.
No.

58:59.320 --> 59:00.514
Hey, Garth!

59:02.000 --> 59:03.115
Don't touch it.

59:04.120 --> 59:06.076
Come on, man.
It's her job.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.799
Gloria.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.474
Garth! Stay out
of this, okay?

59:13.560 --> 59:15.755
In fact, why don't you just
go back in the bathroom?

59:15.840 --> 59:17.656
And, oh, hey, you don't
have to flush the toilet.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.989
We all know you're not taking
a shit in there. Okay?

59:20.640 --> 59:21.709
What?

59:21.800 --> 59:24.712
Buddy, you can snort
whatever you want in my bar.

59:24.800 --> 59:28.076
I just think it'd be nice if you
trusted us a little more, that's all.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.673
We're your friends.

59:29.760 --> 59:32.228
Which is why we've turned
our head for years,

59:32.320 --> 59:33.594
pretending like,
you know,

59:33.680 --> 59:35.976
we don't know what you're doing
when you go in the bathroom.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.309
What are...
Are you crazy?

59:39.560 --> 59:43.394
You know that I have
digestive issues.

59:44.920 --> 59:46.400
You don't even wipe
yourself properly.

59:47.840 --> 59:48.896
Hmm. Is there something
wrong with your nose?

59:48.920 --> 59:51.639
You know that I haven't
snorted anything in years!

59:51.720 --> 59:54.075
I know, I know, I know that,
yeah, no, everybody knows.

59:54.160 --> 59:56.355
Yeah. Very proud of you.

59:56.440 --> 59:57.759
What's with the tone?

59:57.840 --> 59:59.159
What's the problem, Garth?

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.238
Taking a shit make you
this nervous?

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.759
Sit down.
Drink your beer.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.839
It's okay.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.597
Gloria, you sure
you don't want a beer?

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.511
No, I'm good,
Oscar, thanks.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.856
Why, 'cause you're keeping
an eye on me, right?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.880
Well, don't.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.496
'Cause I don't like when
people keep tabs on me.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.839
I'm not keeping tabs
on you.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.192
Then have a beer.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.271
I haven't had
a beer since Sunday.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.952
Or anything
to drink, really.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.189
Why?

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.616
Uh, 'cause I don't
want to do anything stupid.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.995
- Stupid. Don't want... Stupid. Okay.
- Yeah.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.798
Stupid. You mean like
the rest of us, yeah?

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.553
No, Oscar, not like you.
Like me.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.995
Like, stupid like
when I got drunk and fell

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.878
and, you know, killed hundreds of people.
Like that.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.679
And when that happened,
did we start checking up on you

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.398
like you were
a little girl. Huh?

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080
Did we judge you?

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.918
No! Of course not!
That's not who we are.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.991
Hell, Garth here has been
doing coke in secret

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.389
for the last five years,
no one here judges him, right?

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.549
Fuck you!

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.994
You can go to hell!
I'm leaving.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.308
Okay. See you, buddy.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.400
You're lucky that the rest
of us don't have your...

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.674
I thought you were leaving!

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.838
Lucky that
the rest of us...

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.229
You're lucky I don't call
the cops on you, you junkie!

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.275
Come on, Gloria.
Have a beer.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.875
Okay.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.518
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.438
Either you drink that beer,

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.471
or I'll go take a walk
through the, uh, park later.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.469
Hmm?

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.794
What, are you...
Are you kidding?

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.198
Drink it.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.073
Please know that I'm only
being this pushy

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.230
because deep down,
I know you want it.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.880
Huh.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.074
Okay.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.436
Cheers.
Mmm.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.750
Oscar? Oscar, listen.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.717
Hey. Turn off everything,
and lock up, please.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.949
Oscar!

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.479
Oscar. Hey. Hey.
Listen to me!

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.039
Listen to me!
You are drunk!

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.270
Hey. You're drunk. Okay?

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.272
Those are real people and this is just...
This is not a good idea!

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.510
Hey, don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.119
Oscar!

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.110
I know you think everything
revolves around you,

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.316
but it doesn't! Not anymore.
Oscar...

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.789
My life is just as
amazing as yours now.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.872
For once. And if
you don't like it, fuck you!

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.393
Oh, good, you made it!

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.268
I was concerned.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.750
Didn't think you were
going to be here on time.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.795
Nailed it.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.710
Boy, you're pretty winded.
Yeah. It's okay. We can wait.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.038
Yeah. Catch your breath.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.635
What, you're gonna slap me again?
Hmm? All right.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.914
Yeah. Go.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.438
Come on.
Wasn't much on that.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.033
You hit me a lot
harder yesterday.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.951
Come on.
Let's give them a good show.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.431
Yeah. I don't know.
Not the same.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.748
Must have been
the surprise...

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.114
Ooh!

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.816
- Oscar, let me go!
- No punching!

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.239
Stop it! Ah! Oscar.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.536
- Easy, slugger.
- Oscar, let me go.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.376
- Come on, come on, come on.
- You hear me? No punching?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.799
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Okay, okay. Good.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.719
Oscar...
Oscar, stop it.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.296
I don't want to.
Oscar, you're hurting me.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.753
I don't care,
all right?

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.593
Not a direct hit, but you got
the majority of them down there.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.439
Get out!

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.069
Get out.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.149
Fuck you.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.273
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.316
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop!

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.393
Ow!

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.354
It's over!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.908
It's over! So just
stop it! Okay? Please?

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.996
It's over! Stop! Please!

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.719
God dang it! Shit!

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.111
I think you broke
the skin!

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.270
Look at this!
Look what you did to me!

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.510
Here! There are your keys!

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.716
I am not coming back
to your shitty bar!

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.952
Yeah, you are.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.268
Oh, yeah?

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.435
Yeah.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520
Ow!

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.192
You're gonna keep
working at the bar,

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.992
or I'm gonna come back
here tomorrow

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.440
and destroy
an entire neighborhood.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.040
Then I'll come back and
I'll kick your fucking ass!

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.155
No, you won't.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.390
'Cause I'm done being
Mr. Nice Guy.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.031
Ow.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.395
See you at work?

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.233
I'll see you at work.
Come on, let's go!

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.395
Hi.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.948
Hi. Are you alone?

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.072
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.355
Uh...

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.634
Look, I... I just... I wanted
to say I'm sorry for...

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.637
For everything
that's been happening.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.749
I was with Oscar
all morning,

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.990
and he's sorry, too.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.711
He's so sorry that

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.832
he told me to come over
here and give you this.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.233
What is all this?

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.353
Well, it's...
It's for you.

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.349
For your house.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.513
There's, you know, a couple
of rugs, and some chairs,

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.832
and then, um, there's some
side tables in the back

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.434
and I... Well,
I can unload it all myself...

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.234
Gloria?

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.392
Gloria, where are you going?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.430
Gloria.
What the hell are you doing?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.788
Come on.

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:03.554
Come inside.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.229
Uh, do you, um...

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.080
Do you want some coffee,
or something to drink, or...

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.915
What's with the furniture
in the truck, Oscar?

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:26.554
Um...

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.200
I thought I told you
about that.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.877
That's from
my uncle's house.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.029
They aren't using it,

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.576
so, you know, you can do
whatever you want with it.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.794
I don't want it!

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.513
I'm totally ashamed.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:52.912
Yeah, well,
you should be.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:57.914
Did I hurt you?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.256
I mean, do you have any cuts or
bruises or anything like that?

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.157
No. No, not really.
I'm... No.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.878
Are you sure
you're okay?

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.696
Look. We didn't kill
anybody this morning, okay?

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.920
That's all
that matters, right?

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.394
I feel so shitty
that I hurt you.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.914
I just... Such a shitty,
shitty day.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.629
I can't bear to
even think about it.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.835
I'm so sorry, I...

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.472
I'm sorry.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.919
Please, can we
be friends again?

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.155
Listen, buddy, you gotta
promise me something, okay?

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.776
No more staying after
hours at the bar, okay?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.792
You close and you
go home, all right?

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.273
No more late-night drinking.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.709
You promise? Okay. Okay.
I promise. Yeah.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.149
I am no stranger to
fucking up when drunk.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.038
It's okay. We're good.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.149
Thank you.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.829
Jesus Christ!

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.598
Tim, hey, it's...

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.188
What?

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.874
Hey.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.788
Come on in.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.315
Wow.
Yeah.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.549
Mmm.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.476
Um, do you want,
uh, a drink?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.073
Not a drink drink,
but a drink?

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.559
No. No, thanks.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.096
Yeah, no, I was, uh, you know,
been e-mailing you a bit,

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.599
and calling you,

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.079
and didn't hear anything,

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.594
so I was just, uh,
getting a bit worried.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.152
So when's your meeting?
Hmm?

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.276
Your...
Uh, tomorrow morning.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.398
Have you ever
been up here before?

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.198
Actually, no.
No, first time.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.714
We've not had
a client up here.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.077
It's a pretty big
coincidence you're here.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.711
Objectively speaking,
it's a pretty big coincidence.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.736
Yeah, but why do you say it like that?
Like what?

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.193
Like, "Coincidence."

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280
You know what? No.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.436
Forget about it. Never mind.
No, no, no...

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:40.630
Drop it.
'Cause I've been dealing with a few,

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:43.757
you know,
big coincidences recently.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.192
What coincidences?

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.696
You've been looking
for work for a year,

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.154
come home,
suddenly, boop! Job.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.879
Well, maybe I
should have started out

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.791
looking for a job
as a waitress.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.996
Gloria, you are not
a waitress!

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.753
This is new.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.476
What is?
Well...

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.595
You've never been jealous
like this before.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.636
Jealous...
I'm not jealous.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.392
You think I'm jealous?

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.233
Look, all I'm saying is
it's pretty weird that you're here.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.915
No. I am not jealous.
I've never been jealous,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.816
no matter how many times
you've given me reason to be.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.718
I am not jealous, never been jealous,
not about to be jealous...

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.631
And anyway,
we are not going out!

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.711
No, we're not.
So, doesn't matter.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.896
You can do
whatever you want.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.354
Except find a job and take
care of myself, right?

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.476
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're
really doing that.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.278
You're just...
You're doing just great.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:33.360
Just great.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.079
You've moved back home,
working as a waitress.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.195
So what?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.909
In a bar, by the way.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.276
At least your haters on the Internet
will leave you alone in a bar.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.071
Really moving on.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.718
Really evolving.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.956
Used to get your friends to buy you
beers 'cause you had no money.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.312
Now I guess you just
lean over the bar

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.197
and pour yourself
a cheeky one.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.674
Hmm?

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.830
I used to lend you money.
Now, you're just working for tips.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.315
It's great.
Doing really great.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.594
I gotta go.
No. No.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.716
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I just...

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.696
No, it... I've been trying
to talk to you for a while.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.280
I just... I acted like
a total jerk, I'm sorry.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.470
No, I mean,
I have to go to the bar.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.630
My shift
is starting, so...

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.153
Well, let me
give you a lift.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.349
No, no, it's okay. No.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.873
No, it's fine.
Look, coat.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.835
You know. I'm here.
I might as well.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.233
Musty.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.715
Hang on.
What's going on here?

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.995
Sports... Wild West...

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.198
Hey, what's back there?

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.037
Is that a medieval
barbecue or something?

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.076
What is this place?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.752
Hi.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.193
This is, uh...
This is Tim.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.111
- This is Oscar.
- Hello.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.428
What's up?

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.952
You know,
it was Gloria's idea.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.075
What?

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.075
Well, see, this side of the bar
had been closed for years.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.674
But Gloria here thought
it was so "ironic"

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.150
that she was like, "Hey, you
should open this back up."

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.832
And here we are.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.673
Shall we?

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.756
So, what brings you
into town, Tim?

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.872
Um, work.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.234
Work.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.392
Mmm. Good. Work.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.118
I'm sorry, do you
want anything to drink?

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.952
Oh, sure, I'll, uh, take a beer.
Thanks.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.837
Great. Make it two.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.518
It's good having her back in town.
Yeah.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.556
And she's been
a real help around here.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.119
Lot of great ideas.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.832
No, it's just a surprise,
that's all.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.239
Oh, yeah? Why?

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.480
You don't think she's capable
of doing a job like this?

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.856
Well, no, of course she's...
She's capable.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.976
'Cause anybody
can do this, right?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.389
No. I mean, it's as worthy
a job as anything else.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.710
Well, I'm glad
you find it to be worthy.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.349
No, I just... She's never done
anything like this before, you know?

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.880
Hey, guys, can you please not
talk about me like I'm not here?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.153
Hey, Oscar, can I have another
cup of coffee, please?

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.673
Actually, hold on.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.193
Don't go. One sec, Joe.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.392
Please. Sit.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.598
Tim, what would you say would
be the most irresponsible thing

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.999
you could do in this bar?

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.154
What do you think
that is?

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.189
Well, for example,

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:48.838
imagine I were to stand up right
here and show you my ass.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680
That'd be pretty rude.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.079
And yet,
it's not the first time

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.680
something like that's
happened in here.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.477
Not this early,
of course,

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.518
but it has happened.
Right, Joe?

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.353
Yes. Now, can I get
some more coffee, please?

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.759
One sec.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.193
I could take a piss over
there in that corner booth,

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.679
break one of those windows,

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.830
you and me, we could get
in a big old fistfight

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.160
right here
in front of everyone.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.477
Those would all be
irresponsible things to do.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.039
But none of them

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.793
are the most
irresponsible thing.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.235
One sec, Joe,
I'll be right with you, okay?

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.235
This has been
sitting back there for

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.193
almost 10 years now.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.951
Everybody thinks there's a
bottle of fancy bourbon

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.056
or something
like that in here,

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.071
but, well, they'd be wrong.
Nope, nope, nope.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.551
This is actually the most
illegal thing in this bar.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.154
Yeah.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.117
Our pal, Garth,

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.348
and another buddy
of mine

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.113
gave it to me for my
birthday a while back now.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.716
Yeah. They got it down
in "Mehico"

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.751
when they were there
on vacation.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.280
Still can't believe they made
it through customs with it.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.995
Oh.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.640
Thanks for coming in, folks!
Have a good day.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.395
Watch out.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.430
Up until recently,
the boys and I...

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.590
We'd hop in the pick-up,

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.113
we'd get a big bag
of fireworks,

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.720
and then we'd drive out
to the suburbs.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.073
We'd light 'em
all up, you know,

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.376
scare the shit
out of the locals,

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.870
but this, this firecracker,
the biggest one we ever had,

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.393
never made the trip.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.833
Not that we were afraid
to use it.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.036
On the contrary, we just
thought it was so big

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.270
we wanted to save it
for a special occasion.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.590
So we left it behind, every time.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.713
Then,

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.675
we reached a point
where we just grew up.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.160
Stopped screwing around
like that at night.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.112
And our friend here

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.916
found its way to
the shelf back there.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.276
And it waited,
year after year,

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.628
for its big moment.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.696
Joe, you might want
to get out of the way.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.870
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oscar? Oscar!

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.075
What are you doing?

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.856
What... What's he doing?
What are you doing?

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.518
No, no, no... Just... Uh...

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.873
Oh, God!
Fuck! Go!

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.233
Oh, shit!

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.710
Okay. Let's get
out of here. Okay.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.920
How about that, huh?

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.676
You are a crazy person!
Come on, Gloria.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.752
I just did the most irresponsible
thing you could do in this bar.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.718
And you wanna know what?

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.156
Even so, Gloria's not
gonna leave with you.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.754
What? Of course she is.
Come on.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.759
Gloria?

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.476
I am leaving here
at midday tomorrow.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.434
Please come with me.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.918
Gloria, I didn't
have a...

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.638
A meeting. I...

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.028
I came here for you.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.794
I lied.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.469
I'm sorry.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.275
Please.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.868
What a schmuck.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.119
Jesus!

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.355
I'm sorry about that.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.913
Didn't mean
to scare you.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.195
What... How did you
even get in here?

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.509
Your parents gave my parents
a copy years ago.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.909
Okay. Just leave the keys,
and get out.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.877
Come on. Sit down.
Take it easy.

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:50.960
Get out. Get out,
or I'll call the cops!

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.195
Go ahead.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.795
Thank you.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.070
Now, I, uh, came here because
of what your boyfriend said.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.390
Ex-boyfriend.
Whatever.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.912
The whole thing about
you going back with him.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.640
Thought you might be
thinking about it.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.360
I'm just here to make sure
you don't call him.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.072
If you want to,
please, go ahead.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.991
Get some sleep.
I'll be right here.

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.192
You've lost your mind.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.752
You know that, right?

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.080
What matters now
is that you don't lose yours.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.274
What's wrong?

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.353
You hate yourself.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.759
What?

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.190
I used to think
it was something else,

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.508
that you wanted me
to be yours,

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.556
that you wanted
to possess me,

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.949
but, no, it's so much
simpler than that.

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.437
You hate yourself.

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:43.794
What are you talking about?

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.997
You can't stand that
your life feels so small.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.313
It's that simple.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.393
And sad.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.274
Hmm.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.310
Tim. Listen,
I can't explain now,

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.152
but I'm coming with you.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.436
Okay? Bye.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.833
Um...

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.474
Uh...

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.039
No. No, no! Hey! Hey!

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.034
No. No! No!

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.195
Shit!

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.116
Hey.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.873
You can go home
if you want.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.672
Go back to New York.
It's totally your call.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.397
But every morning
you're not here,

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.839
this'll happen.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.755
No, no! No! No! No!

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.954
Gloria, what the fuck is wrong with you?
What is going on?

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.440
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- Where are you?

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.016
I didn't know where you were,
what happened to you...

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.040
I know.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:11.118
I couldn't tell you before now,
'cause I was on a plane...

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:14.391
On a plane?
Yeah. I had to fly somewhere.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:16.072
What do you
mean "somewhere"?

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.912
Ooh, uh...

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.136
Are you... Are you...
Are you fucking with me?

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.673
Is this a joke?
No, listen,

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.598
I just wanted to let
you know that I'm okay,

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.278
and I... I'm really...

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.999
I'm very sorry
that I stood you up.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.317
No, are you gonna tell me
what's going on here?

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.870
No.
Come on.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.136
I think you owe
me an explanation.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.879
What? Why?
No. No, I don't.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.913
Uh, when you kicked me
out of your apartment,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.434
you said that I
was out of control

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.239
and you couldn't
help me in that state.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.833
Well, buddy,

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.237
right now, I am more
out of control than ever.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.551
Well, where
are you? Gloria?

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:02.551
Gloria? Gloria! Glori...

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.869
Oh, shit!

01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.518
Please.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.433
Please.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.959
Put me down.

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.632
Put me down.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.189
Put me down right now,
you fucking bitch!

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:46.794
Did you see

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.916
what just happened
to the robot?

01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.914
Sorry. Are you okay?

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.389
Yeah.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.235
Do you wanna hear
an amazing story?

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.713
Of course.

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.355
Uh, would you like
something to drink?

01:44:19.305 --> 01:44:25.155
