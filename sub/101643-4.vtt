WEBVTT

00:04.919 --> 00:06.003
Oh.

00:06.086 --> 00:07.463
Is that me?

00:08.631 --> 00:09.882
There must be some mistake.

00:09.965 --> 00:12.927
-I can get you more credits.
-I can bring you in warm...

00:14.637 --> 00:15.971
Or I can bring you in cold.

00:23.187 --> 00:24.688
THE CLIENT: Yes, yes, yes!

00:26.065 --> 00:28.817
-Very healthy.
-What are your plans for it?

00:28.901 --> 00:32.071
This asset
was of extreme importance to me.

00:32.154 --> 00:34.198
-What did you do to it?

00:34.281 --> 00:35.950
Don't hurt him. It's just a child.

00:36.033 --> 00:37.743
THE MANDALORIAN:
Cara Dune here was a veteran.

00:37.826 --> 00:39.411
She was a drop soldier for the Rebellion.

00:44.333 --> 00:45.709
-

00:47.044 --> 00:48.045
-

00:48.963 --> 00:50.548
THE MANDALORIAN: You're staying here?

00:50.631 --> 00:52.550
Nevarro is a very fine planet.

00:52.633 --> 00:55.678
And now that the scum and villainy
have been washed away,

00:55.761 --> 00:57.179
it's very respectable again.

00:58.430 --> 01:00.724
THE MANDALORIAN: Hang on, kid.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride,

01:00.808 --> 01:02.893
but I finally know where I'm taking you.

01:39.221 --> 01:42.016
All right, let's try this again.

01:44.101 --> 01:46.270
Okay, did you... Do you have the wire?

01:48.981 --> 01:50.232
No. Nothing.

01:51.984 --> 01:53.861
Hey...

01:57.740 --> 02:00.576
Okay. Did you get the wire out?

02:00.659 --> 02:01.869
The red wire?

02:03.162 --> 02:04.163
Huh?

02:04.246 --> 02:07.541
No, no, no. No, the red one.
Show me the red wire.

02:09.084 --> 02:10.085
The red one.

02:10.669 --> 02:12.213
-Yes, good.

02:12.296 --> 02:16.800
Now, you're going to plug that red wire
where the blue wire goes in the board.

02:19.303 --> 02:23.557
Put the red wire where
the blue wire goes in the board, okay?

02:24.475 --> 02:25.643
But don't let them touch.

02:27.478 --> 02:29.480
You see where you took the blue one off?

02:30.272 --> 02:32.608
-Yes, now put the red one...
-

02:32.691 --> 02:37.905
No, don't put the blue one back.
Put the red one where the blue one was.

02:38.614 --> 02:41.075
And put the blue one
where the red one was.

02:42.409 --> 02:43.744
-But be careful.
-

02:43.827 --> 02:47.206
They're oppositely charged,
so keep them away from each other.

02:47.289 --> 02:49.542
Make sure you hold them apart from...

02:49.625 --> 02:50.876
No, hold them apart.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.044
Oh! Uh-uh...

02:54.004 --> 02:55.464
Oh...

02:57.633 --> 02:58.843
Are you okay?

03:04.473 --> 03:05.766
Well, it was worth a shot.

03:11.689 --> 03:13.983
There's no way
we're making it to Corvus in this shape.

03:22.449 --> 03:24.702
I think we need
to visit some friends for repairs.

03:28.122 --> 03:30.124
So, how'd you like to go back to Nevarro?

05:32.872 --> 05:33.873
Hey!

05:35.040 --> 05:36.542
Okay. Oh. Oh...

05:37.251 --> 05:38.335
Okay, little guy.

05:38.919 --> 05:40.963
No one's eating you today.

05:42.882 --> 05:44.383
Go on, you're free.

05:46.343 --> 05:47.970
Go on. Git.

05:53.517 --> 05:54.518
Okay, look.

05:55.603 --> 05:56.645
Here you go.

05:57.229 --> 05:58.230
That's all I got.

05:59.648 --> 06:02.651
Now, I need to return
all these things to the rightful owners.

07:03.712 --> 07:06.048
GREEF KARGA: Looks like someone
could use some repairs.

07:15.599 --> 07:17.309
THE MANDALORIAN:
How's my credit around here?

07:17.393 --> 07:20.229
I think something could be arranged.
Isn't that right, Marshal?

07:21.438 --> 07:23.232
I'm sure we can work somethin' out.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.652
I'll get my best people on it.

07:26.735 --> 07:27.736
Hey, fellas!

07:28.320 --> 07:30.573
Let's fix this man's ship!
I want it as good as new.

07:33.158 --> 07:36.161
And you, come here, little one!

07:38.706 --> 07:40.666
Has Mando been
taking good care of you, huh?

07:40.749 --> 07:43.377
-Have you been takin' good care o' him?
-

07:43.460 --> 07:46.881
Yeah? Yeah! He said "yeah!" Oh, yeah.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.008
Yes.

07:49.466 --> 07:51.051
Come on. Yeah.

07:51.927 --> 07:53.345
Yeah, look at you.

08:04.315 --> 08:06.609
THE MANDALORIAN:
Looks like you two have been busy.

08:07.359 --> 08:09.778
GREEF KARGA: I myself have been
steeped in clerical work.

08:10.738 --> 08:13.574
Marshal Dune here
is to be thanked for cleaning up the town.

08:14.783 --> 08:16.660
Your ship's not lookin' too good.

08:16.744 --> 08:18.704
I had a run-in with the New Republic.

08:19.413 --> 08:21.332
GREEF KARGA:
They should leave the Outer Rim alone.

08:21.415 --> 08:24.335
If the Empire couldn't settle it,
what makes them think they can?

08:25.211 --> 08:26.212
Here we are.

08:27.004 --> 08:30.049
THE MANDALORIAN: I'm surprised to
see this place is still standing.

08:30.424 --> 08:32.009
Wait till you see inside.

08:35.304 --> 08:36.972
FEMALE PROTOCOL DROID:
Who can name one of

08:37.056 --> 08:39.308
the five major trade routes in the galaxy?

08:39.391 --> 08:40.392
Anyone?

08:40.476 --> 08:42.645
How about the Corellian Run?

08:42.728 --> 08:46.106
-BOY 1: The Hydian Way?
-Yes, the Hydian Way. That is correct.

08:46.190 --> 08:49.235
-A school?
-Things have changed a lot around here.

08:49.318 --> 08:51.737
We'll leave the little one here
so we can talk business.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.406
-Wait. Wherever I go, he goes.
-Mando, please.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.034
Where we're going,
you don't wanna take a child. Trust me.

08:58.452 --> 09:00.538
He'll be fine here. You have my word.

09:02.540 --> 09:07.837
...be transported from the Outer Rim
to as far away as the Core Worlds.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.088
-

09:09.171 --> 09:13.300
However, there are
several other regions within our galaxy.

09:13.384 --> 09:16.512
They are the Mid Rim...

09:16.595 --> 09:20.641
-Come on.
-...the Expansion Region, the Inner Rim,

09:20.724 --> 09:25.145
the Colonies, Core, and Deep Core.

09:27.606 --> 09:30.150
All right, class. Settle down.

09:31.151 --> 09:32.653
Back to the lesson, shall we?

09:34.113 --> 09:37.867
The capital of the Old Republic
was within the Core

09:37.950 --> 09:40.619
on a planet called Coruscant.

09:42.246 --> 09:44.748
-The capital of the New Republic...
-

09:44.832 --> 09:47.751
...is currently on the planet Chandrila,

09:48.586 --> 09:51.130
which is also within the Core region.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.884
-So, back to the start.
-

09:56.010 --> 10:00.723
The system also contains
the Akkadese Maelstrom.

10:01.307 --> 10:06.353
The Maelstrom surrounds Kessel
and its three moons.

10:06.896 --> 10:09.523
-As you learned yesterday...
- No!

10:09.607 --> 10:11.442
-...there are many systems in this galaxy.
-

10:12.318 --> 10:14.778
How many orbits are in the Kessel system?

10:15.529 --> 10:16.906
Do we at least remember that?

10:18.365 --> 10:19.366
BOY 2: Ooh, I know!

10:19.992 --> 10:22.077
Uh... Two?

10:22.703 --> 10:24.747
FEMALE PROTOCOL DROID:
Yes, very good.

10:24.830 --> 10:28.250
As the third moon of Kessel
rotates the outer planet,

10:28.334 --> 10:32.254
you see the moon here
travels in its same orbit.

10:32.338 --> 10:34.965
Now who can track the path
of the orbit here?

10:37.384 --> 10:38.719
Do I have any volunteers?

10:40.137 --> 10:41.138
Anyone?

10:46.393 --> 10:50.231
There's no registration on the ship,
but I'm pretty sure it belongs...

10:52.900 --> 10:54.568
GREEF KARGA:
I believe you two have met.

10:58.155 --> 11:00.282
THE MANDALORIAN:
I'm surprised to see you here.

11:01.242 --> 11:02.243
Right back at ya.

11:02.326 --> 11:05.371
Mythrol here's taken care
of my books since he was a pollywog.

11:05.955 --> 11:08.958
But then he disappeared one day
after a bit of "creative accounting."

11:09.834 --> 11:12.920
Magistrate Karga was generous enough
to let me work off my debt.

11:13.003 --> 11:14.004
Thank you, by the way.

11:14.088 --> 11:16.507
Three hundred and fifty years,
but who's counting?

11:16.590 --> 11:19.301
Well, if he runs off on you again,
let me know.

11:20.010 --> 11:23.472
Let me assure you, I do not wanna
spend any more time in carbonite.

11:24.098 --> 11:25.599
Still can't see outta my left eye.

11:26.976 --> 11:28.269
CARA: Can we talk business?

11:28.352 --> 11:29.937
THE MANDALORIAN:
I'm only here for repairs.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.063
Which'll take a while.

11:31.146 --> 11:33.691
Which means you'll have free time
on your hands, right?

11:36.068 --> 11:37.695
And we could really use your help.

11:38.445 --> 11:39.446
Help how?

11:40.656 --> 11:41.949
This is Nevarro.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.368
We're here.

11:44.451 --> 11:46.996
This entire area's a green zone.
Completely safe.

11:48.289 --> 11:50.249
But over on this side is the problem.

11:51.584 --> 11:53.502
It's an old Imperial base.

11:53.586 --> 11:56.755
It's where all those troops came from
when we defeated Moff Gideon.

11:57.631 --> 12:00.050
This base has been here
since the Imperial expansion.

12:00.593 --> 12:03.846
It's got a skeleton crew, but for
some reason, it hasn't been abandoned.

12:03.929 --> 12:05.973
There's a lot o'
heavy weaponry in that place

12:06.056 --> 12:09.018
the black market would love
to dismantle and get their hands on.

12:09.101 --> 12:12.313
And you wanna mop up the last
of the Imperial force before they do.

12:12.396 --> 12:14.481
Mando, I just want them off my planet.

12:15.649 --> 12:19.820
If we could take out that one last base,
Nevarro would be completely safe.

12:20.529 --> 12:23.032
We could be a trade anchor
for the entire sector.

12:23.115 --> 12:25.159
And the planet would finally be free.

12:30.998 --> 12:32.082
What are we looking at?

12:41.467 --> 12:44.136
The whole base is powered by a reactor.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.097
We sneak in, overload the reactor,
and get the hell outta there.

12:47.556 --> 12:50.476
THE MANDALORIAN: Let's be fast.
And keep the speeder running.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.144
There it is, right there.

12:52.811 --> 12:53.812
You see it?

12:56.065 --> 12:57.858
How close you want me to drop you off?

12:57.942 --> 12:59.401
How 'bout the front door?

13:00.194 --> 13:02.112
It's a little close
for a civilian, isn't it?

13:02.196 --> 13:03.989
I got two choices for ya.

13:04.073 --> 13:06.992
You take us in and I knock
a hundred years off your debt.

13:07.076 --> 13:08.077
Or?

13:08.160 --> 13:10.371
Or I leave ya out here
in the lava flats to walk home

13:10.454 --> 13:12.790
with whatever's left
in your humidity vest.

13:12.873 --> 13:14.250
It's not much of a choice, is it?

13:24.718 --> 13:27.513
MYTHROL: All right.
We can't go any further than this.

13:28.138 --> 13:29.265
GREEF KARGA: Let's go.

13:46.866 --> 13:48.492
Controls are useless. They're melted.

13:48.993 --> 13:51.287
Well, it's probably not rated for lava.

13:51.370 --> 13:52.746
Imperial trash.

13:53.372 --> 13:55.124
All right, I'm headed back.

13:55.207 --> 13:57.543
Hit me up on the comm,
we could set up a rendezvous time.

13:57.626 --> 14:00.212
You park your gills right there
until I say otherwise.

14:00.296 --> 14:02.089
I'm startin' to dehydrate, boss.

14:02.173 --> 14:04.967
Okay, how does 30 more years
off your debt sound?

14:06.051 --> 14:07.511
Can you at least be quick about it?

14:07.595 --> 14:10.097
You wanna be quick?
Grab the flange cutter and help us out.

14:10.598 --> 14:11.807
-

14:11.891 --> 14:13.225
MYTHROL: Okay, fine. I don't like

14:13.309 --> 14:15.311
leaving my speeder like this,
just so you know.

14:15.394 --> 14:16.937
Come on, hurry it up.

14:17.021 --> 14:18.439
MYTHROL: All right, I'm coming.

14:18.522 --> 14:19.857
GREEF KARGA: Hurry up.

14:24.737 --> 14:25.821
Hold tight.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.252
How long is this gonna take?

14:40.336 --> 14:43.255
Look, lady, this is rated
for light plumbing and such.

14:43.339 --> 14:44.882
You're lucky I even packed it at all.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.259
Dank farrik.
-

14:47.760 --> 14:48.928
-

14:53.057 --> 14:54.266
Are you comin' in or what?

14:54.350 --> 14:56.101
I'll take my chances here,
but thank you.

14:56.185 --> 14:59.480
Well, when the lava tide comes in,
give us a holler. We'll drop you a rope.

15:14.703 --> 15:15.829
Empty base, huh?

15:21.961 --> 15:24.255
GREEF KARGA: The reactor should be set
in the heat shaft.

15:24.338 --> 15:26.006
If we drain the cooling lines,

15:26.090 --> 15:28.634
this whole base
will go up in a matter of minutes.

15:28.717 --> 15:31.220
MYTHROL: Look.
It's a mint Trexler Marauder.

15:31.303 --> 15:33.305
We can get a lot for this
on the black market.

15:33.389 --> 15:35.057
THE MANDALORIAN:
And it's gonna get vaporized

15:35.140 --> 15:37.017
like the rest of this base.
Now, let's go.

15:37.101 --> 15:39.270
Such a waste.

15:55.202 --> 15:56.412
Shuttle bay, this is command.

15:58.205 --> 16:01.709
Shuttle bay,
the security feed just went down.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.335
Can you check your relay hub?

16:04.670 --> 16:06.881
Shuttle bay? Shuttle bay, this is...

16:23.439 --> 16:24.648
This will come in handy.

16:26.525 --> 16:28.068
THE MANDALORIAN:
I found the heat shaft.

16:28.652 --> 16:29.653
Let's go.

16:34.283 --> 16:36.660
The access corridor
should be right past this junction.

16:37.453 --> 16:39.496
STORMTROOPER 1:
Must've blown a transformer over there.

16:39.580 --> 16:41.373
STORMTROOPER 2:
All right. We'll check it out.

16:41.457 --> 16:43.542
STORMTROOPER 1: Section-Four? TK-1-4-7.

16:43.626 --> 16:46.629
STORMTROOPER 2: Scan control has been
unreliable since last rotation.

16:46.712 --> 16:48.464
Send a technical crew to check it out.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.888
THE MANDALORIAN:
There, Mythrol, slice that door.

16:57.264 --> 16:58.724
GREEF KARGA: Use the code cylinder.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.450
MYTHROL: Whoa!
GREEF KARGA: Yeah, "whoa" is right.

17:17.785 --> 17:18.827
That's it.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.665
Get on the reactor controls,
drain the coolant lines.

17:22.748 --> 17:23.958
We'll watch the doors.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.377
-Me?
-Yes, you!

17:27.086 --> 17:31.340
I'm afraid o' heights. And heat. And lava.

17:31.423 --> 17:34.385
How 'bout if I put ya back in carbonite?
Get over there!

17:37.680 --> 17:39.390
-There's no guard rail on this.
-Come on!

17:45.646 --> 17:46.647
Oh, boy.

17:53.737 --> 17:56.115
-GREEF KARGA: Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

17:56.198 --> 17:57.491
-Hurry up!
-

18:06.041 --> 18:07.042
MYTHROL: Oh, dear.

18:16.802 --> 18:18.512
All right, she's gonna blow.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.598
Let's go! Let's get outta here!

18:26.270 --> 18:27.271
CARA: How long do we have?

18:27.354 --> 18:28.939
Ten minutes at the most.

18:34.445 --> 18:36.322
STORMTROOPER:
5-3-8-7 and 5-3-8-9, follow me.

18:37.323 --> 18:38.574
Call in reinforcements!

18:47.082 --> 18:49.126
IMPERIAL SCIENTIST:
Hurry up, purge the drives.

18:52.922 --> 18:54.256
Destroy it!

18:58.260 --> 18:59.345
Ahh!

19:13.317 --> 19:14.318
What the...

19:19.823 --> 19:21.992
I thought you said
this was a forward operating base.

19:22.618 --> 19:23.953
I thought it was.

19:24.036 --> 19:25.913
CARA: No,
this isn't a military operation.

19:25.996 --> 19:27.164
This is a lab.

19:27.790 --> 19:29.458
We need to get into the system

19:29.542 --> 19:31.001
and figure out what's going on.

19:31.085 --> 19:33.587
-What about the reactor...
-Do it! Do it.

19:36.715 --> 19:38.092
THE MANDALORIAN:
I don't like this.

19:39.051 --> 19:40.052
Pardon me.

19:45.766 --> 19:47.101
DR. PERSHING:
Replicated the results

19:47.184 --> 19:48.352
of the subsequent trials,

19:48.435 --> 19:50.938
which also resulted
in catastrophic failure.

19:51.647 --> 19:53.816
There were promising effects
for an entire fortnight,

19:53.899 --> 19:56.819
but then, sadly,
the body rejected the blood.

19:59.488 --> 20:02.992
I highly doubt we'll find
a donor with a higher M-count, though.

20:03.075 --> 20:06.245
I recommend
that we suspend all experimentation.

20:06.328 --> 20:09.248
I fear that the volunteer
will meet the same regrettable fate

20:09.331 --> 20:11.667
if we proceed with the transfusion.

20:12.459 --> 20:15.713
Unfortunately, we have exhausted

20:15.796 --> 20:17.173
our initial supply of blood.

20:18.132 --> 20:20.134
The Child is small,
and I was only able

20:20.217 --> 20:22.887
to harvest a limited amount
without killing him.

20:25.639 --> 20:28.684
If these experiments
are to continue as requested,

20:29.685 --> 20:31.854
we would again
require access to the donor.

20:32.646 --> 20:35.649
I will not disappoint
you again, Moff Gideon.

20:37.026 --> 20:40.237
THE MANDALORIAN: This must be
an old transmission. Moff Gideon is dead.

20:40.321 --> 20:44.658
No. This recording's three days old.

20:46.118 --> 20:47.912
THE MANDALORIAN:
If Gideon's alive then...

20:48.495 --> 20:50.039
STORMTROOPER 1: Over there!

20:55.419 --> 20:56.587
STORMTROOPER 2:
We have them!

21:07.181 --> 21:08.307
I need to get the kid.

21:08.390 --> 21:09.850
Jet back, you're faster that way.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.977
We'll head to the speeder
and meet you in town.

21:12.061 --> 21:13.312
GREEF KARGA: Come on, let's go!

21:13.896 --> 21:16.232
When did you say
this place is gonna blow again?

21:20.236 --> 21:21.695
STORMTROOPER: They're on the move!

21:29.620 --> 21:30.663
GREEF KARGA: Let's go!

21:32.498 --> 21:34.834
STORMTROOPER:
We think they may be moving to the... Hey!

22:07.825 --> 22:09.034
STORMTROOPER: This way!

22:43.194 --> 22:45.070
STORMTROOPER:
All right, men, load your weapons.

22:45.738 --> 22:47.198
There they are! Blast 'em!

22:55.080 --> 22:56.498
MYTHROL: We're trapped!

22:58.417 --> 22:59.502
Is that so?

23:00.794 --> 23:01.921
Cover me!

23:05.216 --> 23:06.592
What does she think she's doing?

23:15.267 --> 23:17.603
All right, baby girl,
let's see what you got.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.451
What are you guys waiting for,
an invitation? Let's move!

23:32.535 --> 23:34.537
Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

23:59.103 --> 24:00.688
You're not considering
going over...

24:00.771 --> 24:02.189
Hang on!

24:06.819 --> 24:08.112
Oh, no, no, no, no!

24:20.791 --> 24:22.960
MYTHROL: Wait. Was that my speeder...

24:56.452 --> 24:57.578
Man the guns.

24:57.661 --> 24:58.996
Copy that.

25:24.104 --> 25:25.272
One down.

25:38.536 --> 25:39.995
I've lost him!

25:52.716 --> 25:54.009
Whoo!

26:32.965 --> 26:35.509
Yes! We did it!

26:36.385 --> 26:37.595
Headed home, boss.

26:52.693 --> 26:54.361
That may have been premature.

26:54.945 --> 26:57.156
Take evasive! I got this!

27:29.355 --> 27:31.190
What is going on back there?

27:31.273 --> 27:33.734
You wanna come back here
and try this? Be my guest!

27:40.449 --> 27:42.868
Can't you get this thing to go any faster?

27:43.536 --> 27:45.579
Come on.

28:10.437 --> 28:11.730
We're almost there!

28:32.626 --> 28:34.753
-Yes! Yes!
-

28:35.963 --> 28:37.965
-Hang on, kid.
-

29:46.367 --> 29:47.868
-Yeah!
-

29:49.954 --> 29:51.080
-Yeah!
-

29:53.582 --> 29:55.376
Not too bad, huh, kid?

29:59.797 --> 30:01.090
Oh, boy.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.427
GREEF KARGA: That was some
pretty impressive flying, Mando.

30:05.511 --> 30:06.762
What do I owe ya?

30:06.846 --> 30:08.889
With the repairs, let's call it even.

30:11.350 --> 30:13.727
Can I at least buy you a drink?

30:13.811 --> 30:17.022
THE MANDALORIAN: Sorry. I have some
onboard maintenance I gotta take care of.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.900
Then we gotta hit the road
before Gideon catches wise.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.944
Well, good luck flying, my friend.

30:29.535 --> 30:33.247
So, is there anything else
you can remember before the base exploded?

30:35.124 --> 30:36.458
No.

30:37.918 --> 30:40.171
How long after
the Razor Crest jumped out...

30:40.254 --> 30:42.089
I never said anything about a Razor Crest.

30:42.798 --> 30:43.966
Your transponder log has a...

30:44.049 --> 30:46.594
"Transponder log."
Come on, give me a break.

30:46.677 --> 30:50.472
The control droid
can't tell apart anything pre-Empire.

30:50.556 --> 30:52.600
This isn't Coruscant.

30:53.767 --> 30:55.519
Do you have anything else to add?

30:56.562 --> 30:58.189
Not that I can think of, Officer.

30:58.272 --> 31:00.900
But if somethin' does come to mind,

31:02.151 --> 31:03.819
I'll be sure to send you a 'gram.

31:04.695 --> 31:07.781
That is,
if you're ever out this far again.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.249
What?

31:30.262 --> 31:32.556
You did a hell of a job
cleanin' up the system.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.351
According to records,
you're quite a soldier.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.520
We could really use you.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.148
I'm not a "joiner," Blue.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.030
There's something going on out here.

31:48.697 --> 31:51.367
They don't believe it
on the Core Worlds, but it's true.

31:51.992 --> 31:53.661
These aren't isolated incidents.

31:53.744 --> 31:55.704
They need to be stopped
before it's too late.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.165
But we can't do it without local support.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.588
Says here you're from Alderaan.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.550
I served during Alderaan.

32:13.639 --> 32:14.890
Did you lose anyone?

32:20.020 --> 32:21.438
I lost everyone.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.024
I'm sorry for your loss.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.956
What do you have for me?

33:21.040 --> 33:24.877
The device has been planted,
as you requested.

33:25.753 --> 33:26.795
Good.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.632
You'll be well-rewarded in the new era.

33:47.816 --> 33:49.109
OFFICER: Moff Gideon.

33:51.987 --> 33:55.282
The tracking beacon
has been installed on the Razor Crest.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.785
Does he still have the asset?

33:57.868 --> 34:00.746
Yes. Our source confirmed it.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.334
And we will be ready.
