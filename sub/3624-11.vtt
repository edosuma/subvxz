Wow. An actual
learning curve.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.676
Unh!

10:11.678 --> 10:16.214
Where it would blend in
with all the other squandering

10:16.216 --> 10:22.220
good news. I just diversified
our company's product base.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.188
Way to go, Hank!

10:23.190 --> 10:24.556
What does that mean, exactly?

10:24.558 --> 10:27.392
I bought out a cupcakery
in downtown Upperton.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.594
There's a gourmet
cupcake craze coming

10:29.596 --> 10:31.896
and we are going to be
in front of it.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.699
I am not about to risk
my reputation

10:34.701 --> 10:36.601
as a purveyor
of human suffering

10:36.603 --> 10:38.470
to sell cupcakes!

10:38.472 --> 10:39.304
Mmm.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.306
Oh, they <i>are</i> yummy.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.309
No one would ever
suspect an atmos-freezer

10:44.311 --> 10:45.844
to be stashed inside
a cupcake shop.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.245
Of course they wouldn't!

10:47.247 --> 10:48.313
It would be...

10:48.315 --> 10:49.514
oh, yes.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.149
Yes, I like it.

10:51.151 --> 10:55.353
Shego, you just earned
an attaboy.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.489
Girl.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.293
Hank: It's all about branding.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.495
I added the word gourmet,

11:03.497 --> 11:07.432
and charge 3 times as much
as our nearest competitor.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.500
Hank's?

11:08.502 --> 11:10.201
Yes. We focus-tested
Dr. D.'s,

11:10.203 --> 11:13.772
but everybody associated it
with shampoo for some reason.

11:13.774 --> 11:14.639
Rrrr.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.242
Oh, you know what?
Who cares?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.811
Will you look at
the dough we're making?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.646
Get it? Dough?

11:21.648 --> 11:23.314
Heh heh. [Muttering]

11:23.316 --> 11:25.350
Actually, cupcakes
are made with batter.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.318
And don't start
licking the spoon,

11:27.320 --> 11:29.621
'cause there some bad news
on the new ice age.

11:29.623 --> 11:32.257
You need 3 more strategically
placed atmos-freezers

11:32.259 --> 11:33.792
in order to lower
the temperature enough

11:33.794 --> 11:35.527
to satisfy your evil needs.

11:35.529 --> 11:36.928
You work for me?

11:36.930 --> 11:40.298
Assistant manager
for unexpected setbacks.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.332
Hmm..

11:41.334 --> 11:42.333
Hmm?

11:42.335 --> 11:46.204
I won the office
baseball pool last week?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.305
Ah, yes.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.641
Replicating
the atmos-freezer

11:49.643 --> 11:52.610
problem is we will need
3 more locations

11:52.612 --> 11:55.380
and substantial capital
to fund the construction.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.515
Hank: You should see
these cupcake profits.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.317
It's really too bad
we have only one store.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.953
Demand is outstripping
supply 3 to 1.

12:01.955 --> 12:06.357
A problem is just
a misunderstood opportunity.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.827
Time to franchise.

12:10.296 --> 12:13.565
Still a no-show
on that atmos-freezer, Wade?

12:13.567 --> 12:14.799
Yeah. It's freaky.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.969
With that kind of power
drain would be obvious.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.471
Well, keep looking.

12:19.473 --> 12:22.874
Have you tried Hank's
gourmet cupcakes yet?

12:22.876 --> 12:24.976
The mochamania is the bomb!

12:24.978 --> 12:26.377
Maybe I'll pick up a dozen

12:26.379 --> 12:28.480
and take them to the Ron-ness
after school.

12:28.482 --> 12:29.981
How is Mr. sunshine?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.583
[Scraping]

12:31.585 --> 12:32.617
Kp.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.518
Uh... Ron?

12:33.520 --> 12:34.519
3 little words...

12:34.521 --> 12:36.755
electromagnetic
field radiation.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.624
Well, ok... yeah,
not exactly little.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.259
Ohh...

12:41.261 --> 12:44.562
These electro-whatevers
are everywhere.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.463
Is that right?

12:45.465 --> 12:46.664
Not to worry. Here.

12:46.666 --> 12:49.768
I'll take my chances
with the electro-thingies.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.436
Efrs. And they can cause

12:51.438 --> 12:53.304
all sorts of bad things.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.473
Yeah, bunions, overbites,

12:55.475 --> 12:56.441
memory problems.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.042
Hey. You forgot this.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.677
See?

12:59.679 --> 13:00.612
Ech! Ecch.

13:00.614 --> 13:01.846
Exactly, Ron.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.448
Anything can get you, anytime.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.949
So if you're gonna
live like this,

13:04.951 --> 13:07.685
you might as well
never leave home.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.689
Hank: The gourmet
cupcake concern

13:11.691 --> 13:14.058
represents a huge improvement
in company performance.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.693
Gotta give you props, suit man.

13:15.695 --> 13:19.030
Almost makes me glad
I didn't vaporize you earlier.

13:19.032 --> 13:23.802
Temperatures are dropping
in all four locations.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.505
Sir, we don't have
an atmos-freezer

13:27.507 --> 13:29.507
[whispering]
I'm not talking to you.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.543
I'm on a cupcake
conference call.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.311
With the supply chain in place

13:33.313 --> 13:35.747
we could open Cleveland
by June.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.616
Please tell me
there's someone else

13:38.618 --> 13:40.752
on that conference call.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.789
Was to bring the world
to its frozen knees.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.892
But what's wrong
with a little multi-tasking?

13:47.894 --> 13:48.660
[Slurp]

13:48.662 --> 13:49.994
Out of the box you go.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.096
The one you are
thinking inside.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.699
[Stammering and muttering]

13:54.701 --> 13:57.802
You... oh, Shego,
it's corporate jargon.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.804
Never mind.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.545
Huh?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.480
Snow?

14:09.482 --> 14:12.750
In spring?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.385
Wade?

14:14.387 --> 14:16.888
The atmos-freezer?
I'm thinking...

14:16.890 --> 14:18.356
Drakken.
Can you beep Ron?

14:18.358 --> 14:21.726
But I'm not getting any answer.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.661
[Door creaks]

14:23.663 --> 14:25.129
Ron?

14:25.131 --> 14:26.698
In here!

14:26.700 --> 14:28.633
[Door squeaks]

14:28.635 --> 14:29.767
[Squeak.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.469
Ron?

14:31.471 --> 14:32.537
What is this?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.605
Panic room.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.839
Of course it is.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.541
5-inch-thick walls
of solid steel

14:36.543 --> 14:38.576
and the only place I feel safe

14:38.578 --> 14:41.112
against the statistical
cruelties of this world.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.014
[Jabbering and squeaking]

[Jabbering]

14:47.087 --> 14:49.520
Ron, this is so a Drakken plot.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.958
Ron: Weather? Didn't he
already do weather?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.727
Only difference is,
for some reason

14:55.729 --> 14:56.828
it's working this time.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.163
I mean, the odds against him
are tremendous.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.698
I don't care about odds.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.133
I care about backup.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.668
Which I need.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.036
You don't want me, Kim.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.704
I'm an accident
waiting to happen.

15:06.706 --> 15:07.939
Ron, you're not gonna...

15:07.941 --> 15:11.576
high-speed Internet,
and those cupcakes,

15:11.578 --> 15:13.845
which are terrific, by the way.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.580
[Crunch] Mmm!

15:15.582 --> 15:18.016
Kim, Rufus, I'm sorry.

It's how it has to be.

Ohh... Oh, oh...

15:32.731 --> 15:35.133
Perkins, what's a takeaway?

15:35.135 --> 15:37.435
Global temperatures
are plummeting.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.103
And sales in our new
Miami store

15:39.105 --> 15:40.705
are beating projections.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.473
Ooh! It's a win-win.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.642
Both: Aah! Would
you two stop that!

15:44.644 --> 15:46.044
Am I the only one around here

15:46.046 --> 15:47.779
keeping your eye on the prize?

15:47.781 --> 15:50.815
The new ice age is 2 days away.

of spinning off

division.

take over the world.

cupcake concern public

16:15.041 --> 16:17.208
with a big wall street
splash next week.

with the big boys.

mission thing

on my monitor back home.

No! I... I just want to check

if I brought
the motion deactivator.

what you learn

when you spend your whole
life calculating hazards.

speaking.

19:25.899 --> 19:29.033
Who knew revenge
would be so... Sweet?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.334
Isn't this where
you're supposed to say,

19:30.336 --> 19:31.669
"you'll never get away
with it"?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.138
Only when I'm absolutely
positive he won't.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.206
Double-dip them!

19:35.208 --> 19:38.342
Well, there are
worse ways to go.

19:39.411 --> 19:40.178
Ron!

19:40.180 --> 19:41.712
Can I get a boo-yah?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.181
Aah!
Aah!

19:43.183 --> 19:44.148
Got it!

19:44.150 --> 19:46.717
Oof!

19:46.952 --> 19:48.853
Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...

19:48.855 --> 19:50.188
Aah...

19:50.190 --> 19:51.923
Get them!

19:51.925 --> 19:54.392
We're taking the early
retirement package.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.160
But our incentive program!

19:56.162 --> 19:57.461
We got a better incentive.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.796
Yeah, to live.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.265
Way to go, Bob.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.872
Ron, I can't believe...

20:07.874 --> 20:08.973
yeah, I know.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.308
Guys. I'm still here.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.342
Right.
Oh.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.945
Ron, the atmos-freezers.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.080
I'm on it.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.348
Uhh! Eek!

20:17.350 --> 20:20.718
Can one crime-fighting
cheerleader bring?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.320
Just evening the odds.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.155
Wah-hah!

20:28.794 --> 20:30.127
Wah-hah!

20:30.129 --> 20:32.396
[Rumbling]

20:40.973 --> 20:42.240
Oh, no!

20:42.242 --> 20:46.077
Ron is surviving way longer
than I thought he would.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.845
Isn't it romantic?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.780
Yaah!

20:55.754 --> 20:57.488
Ehh!

21:00.525 --> 21:01.392
[Gulp]

21:01.394 --> 21:05.997
There is a 99% chance
that whatever you do to me

21:05.999 --> 21:07.465
is gonna hurt real bad.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.000
Oh, you can count on it.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.801
Check your figures, Shego.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.938
Unh! Yaah!

21:28.820 --> 21:30.321
Ron, you were awesome.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.989
Yeah, I know.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.959
Ow! Ow, ow! Ow!

21:37.129 --> 21:40.331
Time to go live
on an updated action plan.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.099
Run!

21:42.101 --> 21:43.567
[Rumbling]

21:44.236 --> 21:47.805
This is going
to negatively impact

21:47.807 --> 21:50.441
third-quarter performance.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.447
Ron, look out, you could slip.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.548
There's a good chance of it.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.216
And you know what?
I don't care.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.218
Give it up
for the new Ron Stoppable,

22:01.220 --> 22:04.322
risk-taker.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.900
But you're still gonna
ride in the backseat?

22:15.902 --> 22:17.101
Well, I may be
a risk-taker,

22:17.103 --> 22:19.236
but mama didn't raise no fool.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.938
A-yup, yup.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.943
That you didn't take over
the world... again.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.145
Now we're stuck
with the cupcakes.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.847
That low-carb trend
was coming.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.048
Should have been
in front of it.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.484
A problem is just
a misunderstood opportunity.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.153
Are you going to help me
with these or not?!

22:36.155 --> 22:41.892
Who... ok, that's taking
casual Fridays too far.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.395
