have a moment of silence
for Daniel Simmonds.

is never normally a minute.

10:57.221 --> 11:00.007
I did it so much
I got arthritis that summer.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.486
- Got it. Yeah.
- It's this finger.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.792
Yeah, yeah.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.359
So, tell me, what happened?
What'd you do?

11:04.402 --> 11:05.926
Why are you assuming
it's something I did?

11:05.969 --> 11:07.188
That's called
victim blaming, mate.

11:07.231 --> 11:10.582
I'm sorry, but...
what'd you do?

11:10.626 --> 11:13.194
So, they asked me
what some of my weaknesses are.

11:13.237 --> 11:15.718
- And you said?
- I said that some people
think my penis is too big.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.241
Oh, my God, Bav.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.982
Why would you say that
in a work review?!

11:19.026 --> 11:20.201
It was obviously a joke!

11:20.244 --> 11:21.332
I didn't think
that she'd get offended!

11:21.376 --> 11:22.682
She?!
You said that to a female?!

11:22.725 --> 11:24.074
I mean, you don't ever
refer to your penis

11:24.118 --> 11:25.423
in a work review, Bav.
That's page one.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.643
Especially to a woman.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.341
Alright, it was a gamble
that didn't pay off, I get it.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.996
But, now, they're calling me
a misogynist.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.997
Me?!

11:34.041 --> 11:35.999
I love women.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.219
You know, I'm always
trying to have sex
with literally any woman?

11:38.262 --> 11:40.351
- It's true.
- I might call them up
and tell them, actually.

11:40.395 --> 11:43.703
- I don't think that'll help.
- I'm such an idiot.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.706
[sighs]

11:46.749 --> 11:48.708
I'm just no good
at this life stuff.

11:50.753 --> 11:54.365
Maybe it would just be better
if I wasn't here.

11:55.453 --> 11:56.977
What?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.327
After you come back
from your honeymoon,

11:59.370 --> 12:03.505
if I'm not around anymore,
just don't to be sad, okay?

12:03.548 --> 12:05.507
- What do you mean?
- You've got Sarah now.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.596
You'll be okay without me.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.337
Just do me one favor though.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.167
When I'm not here anymore...

12:14.559 --> 12:17.780
come back here
to the fingering tree...

12:17.824 --> 12:19.521

12:31.968 --> 12:33.491
Sarah, we've got a problem.

12:33.535 --> 12:36.059
I think I've a solution
but, uh...

12:37.495 --> 12:39.671
I'm gonna need you

13:01.171 --> 13:02.869
Oh, thank you, yeah.
It's uh...

13:02.912 --> 13:05.828
See you next Tuesday.
So, it's C-U-N-T.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.004
- It actually stands for--
- Yeah, we know
what it stands for.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.397
Okay.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.835
- I think it really suits you.
- Oh, thank you.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.579
How lucky was it that there was
an extra plane ticket for me?

13:17.622 --> 13:19.668
Oh... really lucky.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.104
- Right?
- So lucky.

- Okay, mine's all clogged up.

Okay, you don't wanna know
what's going on there right now.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.628
I shouldn't have had
those clams on the plane.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.239
They weren't serving
clams on the plane.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.457
No, I brought them from home.
I shouldn't have left them

14:53.501 --> 14:54.894

Just use one of

If we're gonna
spend the day alone,

17:10.116 --> 17:12.509
- what's Sarah gonna do?
- No, no.

Sarah and me
are spending the day together.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.686
- The whole day?
- Yes, the whole day.

Remember, this is mine
and Sarah's honeymoon, right?

Yes, you don't have to
remind me,
you go on about it all the time.

seem to be sinking in.

Tintoretto's paintings,

19:38.046 --> 19:40.614
I was, like, obsessed

of light and color.

23:35.239 --> 23:37.328
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.939
I'm sorry.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.028
Aye-yi-yi.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.034
Thank you so much.
They're gonna love this.

23:47.077 --> 23:48.209
Okay, come, come.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.820
In here.

23:50.864 --> 23:54.781
Andale, andale, andale,
andale, andale.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.173
[chuckles]

23:56.217 --> 23:59.133
Okay, we're gonna hide in here,

23:59.176 --> 24:00.613
wait for them to arrive,

24:00.656 --> 24:02.310
and when I say,
"One, two, three,"

24:02.353 --> 24:03.659
we're going to burst out
and give them

24:03.703 --> 24:05.618
the romantic surprise
of their lives.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.020
[moaning]

24:19.196 --> 24:20.328
[shushing]

24:22.199 --> 24:23.636
- Put it on.
- Really?

24:23.679 --> 24:24.985
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.422
I can hear them.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.555
- Okay.
- Well, how can I serve you,
my lady?

24:29.598 --> 24:30.904
So, you're a jester,
aren't you?

24:30.947 --> 24:33.950
- Yeah.
- Be a donkey and make me laugh.

24:33.994 --> 24:34.864
[Adam] Oh...

24:34.908 --> 24:36.387
Tamb...

24:36.431 --> 24:38.564
- [Adam] You wanna ride me?
- This one, clarinet?

24:39.303 --> 24:42.698
[braying]

24:42.742 --> 24:44.831
[Sarah] Faster, faster, faster.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.397
[braying continues]

24:49.139 --> 24:50.706
Faster.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.969
Go faster! Faster!

24:57.321 --> 24:59.323
- [tambourine jingles]
- [mutters]

24:59.367 --> 25:00.716
[whispers]
Shut the fuck up!

25:00.760 --> 25:01.848
Did you hear that?

25:01.891 --> 25:03.850
- What was that?
- Be quiet!

25:09.290 --> 25:10.683
[whispers] Shut...

25:16.732 --> 25:18.560
[Sarah gasps]

25:23.434 --> 25:25.306
And a one, and a two,
and a three...

25:25.349 --> 25:27.613
[band playing]

25:37.100 --> 25:39.233
[Adam] To be clear, we're only
coming to this friend of yours

25:39.276 --> 25:41.409
because you promised
not to ever mention
what you just saw

25:41.452 --> 25:43.585
for the rest of your life.
Right?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.631
- [Bav] Yeah, I promise!
- [Adam] Alright.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.981
[Bav] It was weird though,
and really disturbing.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.157
- [Adam] Dude...
- [Bav] I mean,
what was that donkey stuff?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.462
[Adam]
You literally just promised!

25:51.506 --> 25:53.203
- You just promised!
- [Bav] Okay, sorry!

25:53.247 --> 25:54.465
It was just, sort of freakish.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.902
[Adam] Shut up!

25:58.513 --> 26:00.471
- Fuck me!
- Wow.

26:00.515 --> 26:01.864
[chuckles]

26:03.257 --> 26:05.346
Who the hell
is this friend of yours?

26:05.389 --> 26:07.348
To be honest,
the house is bigger
than I was expecting.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.871
- See, I'm connected, baby!
- Bav!

26:08.915 --> 26:11.395
Hey, Giorgio!

26:11.439 --> 26:13.006
[speaking Italian]

26:15.051 --> 26:16.792
These are my friends
I was telling you about.

26:16.836 --> 26:17.793
- Hey, Adam--
- Piacere.

26:17.837 --> 26:19.403
Oh.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.971
Right on, cool, right on.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.930
Okay. Wait, whoa--
Why are you kissing me?

26:23.973 --> 26:25.845
- 'Cause he just did it.
- Why is your mouth so wet?

26:25.888 --> 26:27.324
It's spittle
from the excitement.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.935
Bav told me all about you.

26:28.978 --> 26:31.111
Although, I'm a little annoyed,
you didn't tell me

26:31.154 --> 26:33.635
you were bringing a goddess
to the house.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.464
Who are you talk-- Sarah?

26:39.119 --> 26:40.599
Of course, Sarah.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.126
So you're married, yes?

26:46.169 --> 26:47.040
To him?

26:48.041 --> 26:50.260
I am, yes.

26:50.304 --> 26:53.437
- [Adam chuckles]
- [all chuckling]

26:58.921 --> 27:00.314
[speaks Italian]

27:00.357 --> 27:02.621
Love is...
has no logic, no reason.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.623
It's a...
a thing of the heart.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.364
- Hm.
- What do you, what do you--
What?

27:07.408 --> 27:08.931
Come, come, let me show you.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.368
I have a few friends around,
but make yourself home.

27:11.412 --> 27:14.154
- What is he talking...?
- Went over your head,
it's too deep for you.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.465
[upbeat dance music playing]

27:21.509 --> 27:22.684
Apples!

27:22.728 --> 27:24.207
Don't pick 'em.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.993
Whoa...

27:27.036 --> 27:30.344
Look, chicks, chicks,
chicks, chicks, chicks!

27:30.387 --> 27:31.867
I'm definitely
getting laid tonight.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.264
More! More chicks!

27:43.836 --> 27:46.534
Wow, the art here is amazing.

27:46.577 --> 27:47.927
Let me show you.

27:49.319 --> 27:50.756
[chuckles]

27:50.799 --> 27:52.801
[mutters] I think I've died
and gone to heaven.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.197
Oi, this one's checking me out.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.112
- She's checking out her phone
what are you talking--
- Shh...

28:03.986 --> 28:05.031
[Adam] What is that?

28:17.913 --> 28:18.958
Fuck off.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.832
You tried... you did your best,
you did your best.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.617
[Giorgio] These are
the original prototypes

28:26.661 --> 28:29.708
of the Venetian masks.
They were made 800 years ago.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.406
Wow.
They must be worth a fortune.

28:32.449 --> 28:35.017
Ah, priceless.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.411
- What is the manuscript?
- This?

28:37.454 --> 28:40.544
This is a letter
written by Pope Gregory

28:40.588 --> 28:42.198
to one of my ancestors.

28:42.242 --> 28:45.462
One of my
most valuable possessions.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.942
I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.335
Hallway, to the left.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.081
[Bav] Just like...

28:55.124 --> 28:57.736
karate's is more of kind of
a state of mind, you know.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.303
You kind of live it.
Let me show you something.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.783
[makes karate grunt]

29:17.799 --> 29:20.541
Sorry, I was just
looking for the bathroom.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.632
[tense music playing]

29:30.333 --> 29:32.161
You know people punch like this.
[grunting weakly]

29:32.205 --> 29:33.989
No, twist like this.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.252
[grunting]

29:36.296 --> 29:37.732
You know?
You twist...

29:38.646 --> 29:39.995
What the fuck?

29:40.039 --> 29:40.866
Uppercut!

29:40.909 --> 29:43.172
[makes whooshing sound]

29:44.652 --> 29:46.001
Knock your head off.

29:46.567 --> 29:47.786
Clean off.

29:48.612 --> 29:49.744
Bav, by the way.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.227
- Bang, bang, bang.
- Bav, Bav, come here.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.011
- What?
- Listen to me, listen to me.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.361
[exhales]
Shit just got fucking real, bro.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.059
- What happened?
- We need to
get the hell out of here.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.538
What? Are you joking me?
I'm totally in there
with Angelina.

30:01.582 --> 30:04.803
I don't give a fuck
about Angelina, okay?

30:04.846 --> 30:06.543
You listen to me,
you stay right here.

30:06.587 --> 30:07.849
- I'm gonna go get Sarah.
- What's happened?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.459
Just shut up, wait here.

30:09.503 --> 30:12.723
[scoffs]
Sorry. Anyway... So...

30:12.767 --> 30:14.987
Hey, hey.
Can't I talk to you--?

30:15.030 --> 30:18.991
I cannot believe this.
Giorgio said he will help me
get an exhibition!

30:19.034 --> 30:20.731
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, that's brilliant!
That's brilliant.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.298
Oh, thanks. Oh, but we do--

30:22.342 --> 30:23.778
Unfortunately, we have to go.
So, Giorgio,

30:23.822 --> 30:25.388
thanks so much
for a great evening,

30:25.432 --> 30:26.912
and, um, yeah.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.478
- You're leaving already?
- Yeah.

30:28.522 --> 30:30.350
- But it's only three am.
- Yeah, the night is young.

30:30.393 --> 30:33.048
But we have this thing tomorrow,
so, so we gotta--

30:33.092 --> 30:34.397
Maybe we'll do it
again some time.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.051
- I would like that, very much.
- Bav, come on.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.053
- Hold on, I'm just
showing her these moves.
- No, let's go!

30:38.097 --> 30:39.925
Hey, Giorgio,
check this shit out!

30:39.968 --> 30:41.752
[grunts]

30:59.945 --> 31:01.642
I literally can't believe it.

31:02.686 --> 31:03.992
I can.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.211
[Bav] What? It was an accident.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.342
Have you ever had
an accident before?

31:06.386 --> 31:07.430
Not like that, Bav.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.128
Not like that.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.435
[speaking Italian]

31:35.371 --> 31:36.372
[snaps fingers]

31:43.553 --> 31:45.816
You know,
I think we should just go.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.166
But Giorgio
told us to wait here.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.602
Have you not
fucking gotten it yet?

31:48.645 --> 31:49.777
Giorgio's back there right now

31:49.820 --> 31:51.387
with the cast
of the fucking Sopranos.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.520
Oh, come on, Adam.
What, just because
we're in Italy

31:53.563 --> 31:54.869
everyone's automatically
the mafia?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.175
- You know what?
- Yeah?

31:56.218 --> 31:57.785
- That's quite stereo-typical.
- Oh, no.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.570
- And a little bit racist.
- They're drug dealers!

32:00.614 --> 32:02.007
Oh, who hasn't sold
a bit of drugs?

32:02.050 --> 32:03.269
It's not like
they're violent criminals--

32:03.312 --> 32:04.705
Is this a bullet hole?

32:09.275 --> 32:11.190
- Okay, let's get
the fuck out of here.
- Let's-- yeah.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.495
[Giorgio speaks Italian]

32:12.539 --> 32:13.888
[in English] Leaving already?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.585
Hey, Giorgio.

32:15.629 --> 32:16.804
Yeah, we gotta get going

32:16.847 --> 32:18.023
'cause we've got
that thing tomorrow.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.546
- Sit down, please.
- And, uh...

32:20.329 --> 32:21.591
Yeah.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.249
[speaks Italian]

32:30.731 --> 32:32.733
We need to have a conversation.

32:32.776 --> 32:35.127
About the broken art and stuff?

32:35.170 --> 32:36.911
Yes, about the broken art
and stuff.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.174
Yeah, can I just say
that Bav is really,

32:39.218 --> 32:41.263
- really sorry
about what happened.
- Yeah.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.873
- [Adam] Aren't you, Bav?
- [Bav] Yeah, I'm really sorry.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.614
I was just--
I was talking to that girl,

32:44.658 --> 32:47.443
and I thought I was in there,
and I thought I'd show her

32:47.487 --> 32:49.315
some moves,
I did the spinning kick--

32:49.358 --> 32:51.099
To be honest, I am very sorry,

32:51.143 --> 32:52.753
but everything was placed
quite precariously.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.189
You should really space it out

32:54.233 --> 32:56.800
'cause it was
just waiting for an accident.

32:56.844 --> 32:59.760
Well, when my father
finds out about this,

32:59.803 --> 33:02.110
he's gonna lose his temper...

33:02.154 --> 33:04.504
and that won't be
good for anyone.

33:04.547 --> 33:05.896
This needs to be paid for.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.246
By insurance?

33:07.289 --> 33:09.291
There is no insurance.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.163
That's weird.

33:11.206 --> 33:14.166
- Look, I have an idea.
- Yeah.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.864
You know we are quite close
to the Slovenian border here?

33:16.907 --> 33:18.561
- [Adam] Okay.
- I have a package

33:18.605 --> 33:20.041
that I need to be delivered.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.565
You take the package
to Slovenia,

33:22.609 --> 33:25.090
collect the money,
bring it back

33:25.133 --> 33:27.744
and maybe we can forgive
the broken art. Huh?

33:27.788 --> 33:29.007
[Adam] Sounds good, but,
the only thing is,

33:29.050 --> 33:31.052
I kind of have a policy
against taking

33:31.096 --> 33:32.793
mystery packages
across foreign borders.

33:32.836 --> 33:35.622
[snaps fingers] I think maybe
you're gonna change that policy.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.537
[whispers]
I think the mystery package
might be drugs.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.581
[whispers]
Of course, it's drugs!

33:38.625 --> 33:40.801
Okay, it's settled then.
Adam, Bav,

33:40.844 --> 33:43.021
you will go to Slovenia
with the package.

33:43.064 --> 33:46.981
And, uh, I will keep Sarah
as security.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.635
- Okay, deal.
- Wait, hold on.
What, what, what?

33:48.678 --> 33:51.725
Yeah, what?
I'm not staying here.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.770
But if you are not staying

33:53.814 --> 33:55.642
how do I know that you guys
won't run away?

33:55.685 --> 33:58.688
- Because we promise.
- Oh, I don't--
People break promises.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.821
This is bullshit.
I'm not staying.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.431
Yeah, and I'm not
leaving her here, so...

34:02.475 --> 34:04.999
Well, we could always go with
the alternative option

34:05.043 --> 34:06.957
that my men in here
came up with.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.089
What's the alternative option?

34:08.132 --> 34:10.178
They want to take you
for a drive

34:10.222 --> 34:11.701
to the water's edge,
shoot you in the head

34:11.745 --> 34:13.659
and throw your corpses
into the canal.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.574
[tense music playing]

34:19.492 --> 34:23.800
You know, why don't you
take a couple of minutes
to think about it, huh?

34:25.018 --> 34:26.063
Okay.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.327
Okay.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.813
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

34:36.857 --> 34:39.467
Honestly, from the minute
I met Giorgio,

34:39.512 --> 34:42.123
I just knew there was
something off about him.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
And you still decided to
bring us to his fucking house.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.693
Well, I mean, he's so charming.
He looks like James Bond.

34:46.735 --> 34:48.911
I mean, you were getting on
just fine with him,
to be honest.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.524
Yes, I was actually,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.569
until you went Mr. Bean
on his art collection!

34:53.612 --> 34:56.094
You know what, honestly,
what is the big deal
about art anyway?

34:56.137 --> 34:58.400
Like, it's just--
it's just shapes and sizes,

34:58.444 --> 35:00.881
like little dicks.
They always have statues
with the little dicks.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.535
I don't-- What's the big deal?
What's the fuss about?"

35:02.578 --> 35:04.406
You know what, Bav?
I'm gonna kill you.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.800
- What?
- I'm just gonna
actually kill you.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.062
What? What are you doing?

35:08.106 --> 35:08.976
- What's she doing?
- Sarah, stop it!

35:09.019 --> 35:10.238
- Whoa, whoa...
- I really...

35:10.282 --> 35:11.544
- Okay, Sarah...
- Geez.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.415
- Sarah, stop. Sarah!
- [muffled yelling]

35:13.459 --> 35:15.765
- Adam, Adam!
- Sarah! Sarah, get--

35:15.809 --> 35:17.593
Sarah! Sarah!

35:17.637 --> 35:19.334
- [grunts]
- Stop it! Stop it!

35:19.378 --> 35:21.467
I never want to see
his stupid face ever again!

35:21.510 --> 35:23.208
- Do you hear me?
- Stupid face?

35:23.251 --> 35:25.949
- Yes, your stupid idiot face!
- Okay. Just calm down!

35:25.993 --> 35:29.779
No, I'm not going to calm down
because this is
just as much your fault!

35:29.823 --> 35:31.129
Why? Why is it my fault?

35:31.172 --> 35:34.088
Because you thought it was
gonna be a good idea

35:34.132 --> 35:36.786
to bring this moron
on our honeymoon!

35:36.830 --> 35:40.050
- Okay, okay.
- I mean, Adam,
what is he even doing here?!

35:40.094 --> 35:41.574
Let's just talk about this
another time.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.532
Please, maybe when our lives
aren't being threatened?

35:43.576 --> 35:45.012
- Fine.
- Okay.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.709
- Or just...
- Just go.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.277
The two of you
can finally be together,

35:49.321 --> 35:51.366
which is clearly what you want.

35:51.410 --> 35:54.195
Sarah,
I'm not leaving you, okay?

35:54.239 --> 35:55.327
We don't have a choice.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.415
Unless you want all of us

35:56.458 --> 35:57.590
to end up in the canal.

35:57.633 --> 35:58.939
[speaks Italian]

36:02.595 --> 36:04.336
[in English]
Did you make up your mind?

36:04.379 --> 36:06.076
[Sarah] Yes.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.601
We decided to go for
the not getting murdered option.

36:08.644 --> 36:09.950
[exhales] What a relief.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.561
[muttering]

36:12.605 --> 36:14.694
I hate it when people I like
get murdered.

36:16.435 --> 36:17.827
Let's-let's get you ready.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.622
Could we really
not just put this
all in the trunk of the car?

36:29.665 --> 36:33.626
Unfortunately, they...
they have roadblocks
and search the cars.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.236
It's safer this way.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.586
But do we need to tape it
to our actual skin?

36:37.630 --> 36:41.068
Yes. Rico will give you
the instructions
and the address.

36:41.764 --> 36:42.809
Feeling good?

36:42.852 --> 36:45.072
I've felt better.

36:45.115 --> 36:46.813
Just get back
as quickly as possible, okay?

36:46.856 --> 36:48.162
- I will.
- Okay.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.337
I'm so sorry.

36:49.381 --> 36:51.687
I can promise you that...

36:51.731 --> 36:53.341
I will take
good care of Sarah.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.909
And, oh, and if you
think about calling the police,

36:55.952 --> 36:57.824
or doing anything, um...

36:58.955 --> 37:00.043
Well, you know...

37:02.524 --> 37:03.525
Okay.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.572
How can he manage
to threaten to kill us

37:06.615 --> 37:08.008
and still be
so goddamn charming?

37:08.051 --> 37:09.749
I mean, that is charisma.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.142
Alright, here's the address.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.841
And what happens
if we do get caught?

37:14.884 --> 37:17.670
[chuckles] If you want to see
your wife alive again...

37:18.801 --> 37:19.889
don't get caught.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.461
- He's less charming.
- Let's just get this over with.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.171
Well, at least Giorgio sorted us
out with a really nice car.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.220
- Shall we pop the radio on?
- No.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.137
Adam, mate,
don't worry, alright?

37:50.180 --> 37:51.704
It's gonna be okay.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.532
Giorgio said that he's
gonna look after Sarah,

37:53.575 --> 37:55.185
and I really believe him.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.013
Yeah, unfortunately,
I think I know
what he has in mind.

37:57.057 --> 37:59.189
- What, you think he's into her?
- He's clearly into her!

37:59.233 --> 38:01.235
He was all over her
from the second
that we walked in.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.106
Well, he might
fancy her a little bit.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.065
But I don't think
that she'd be into him..

38:05.108 --> 38:07.894
I mean, although he is
ridiculously good looking.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.679
And he's so charming,
and he's filthy rich.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.812
He kinda reminds me of, like,
an Italian movie star.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.770
- What's your point?!
- I'm just saying, Adam,

38:14.814 --> 38:16.772
that you're her husband, okay?

38:16.816 --> 38:19.209
She's committed to you,
whether she likes it or not.

38:22.691 --> 38:24.040
Okay, well, listen,

38:24.084 --> 38:26.869
if you get hungry later,
I've got some sandwiches.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.568
- I've got ham and I've got egg.
- Look, this isn't a jolly,
okay?!

38:29.611 --> 38:31.570
It's not some fun
little road trip.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.876
We're smuggling drugs,
and we're risking our lives

38:33.920 --> 38:37.097
and potential prison,
while my wife
is being held hostage

38:37.140 --> 38:39.273
by a particularly handsome
Italian drug lord.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.276
- He is handsome.
- So forgive me if I don't wanna
listen to the radio,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.539
and-and eat fucking sandwiches!

38:44.583 --> 38:46.411
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

38:47.542 --> 38:48.630
Just give me the egg.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.023
Actually,
I quite wanted the egg.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.590
Just give me
the fucking egg, Bav!

38:52.765 --> 38:54.070
Just unwrap the foil, please.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.245
Yeah, sure, sorry.

38:55.985 --> 38:56.943
Here...

38:59.249 --> 39:01.251
- [tires screeching]
- [muffled] Stop!

39:01.295 --> 39:04.559
- Alright, sorry.
- Why is it... still hot?
Why is it so wet?

39:04.603 --> 39:06.344
Well, it's been in my pocket,
obviously, I mean...

39:07.257 --> 39:08.171
[spits]

39:08.215 --> 39:09.477
Oh, that's a waste.

39:09.521 --> 39:10.826
[groans] It's disgusting.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.176
Just give me the ham.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.656
- You want the ham?
- Yeah.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.313
Why are you doing that again?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.097
- Sorry.
- We just went through that.

39:23.012 --> 39:26.799
Hey, don't look so sad,
beautiful.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.453
Listen to me, motherfucker,

39:28.496 --> 39:32.065
if you or anyone
thinks about touching me,

39:32.108 --> 39:36.809
you should be aware that I know
15 different self-defense
kill moves,

39:36.852 --> 39:38.767
including the one
with the thumbs in the eyeballs.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.639
[Giorgio] I can assure you
he's not gonna touch you.

39:40.682 --> 39:41.466
How do you know?

39:41.509 --> 39:43.990
Ah, because he's gay.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.339
Are you?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.385
Just because I'm a drug dealer
I can't be gay?

39:48.777 --> 39:51.345
Are you stereotyping
homosexuals?

39:52.912 --> 39:54.217
[coughs]

39:55.131 --> 39:56.394
[speaks Italian]

39:59.092 --> 40:01.181
[peaceful music playing]

40:05.011 --> 40:07.927
[Bav] God, it's amazing here,
isn't it?

40:07.970 --> 40:11.844
Remember that, um, school trip
we had to the Lake District?

40:11.887 --> 40:13.280
This kinda like
reminds me of that.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.716
Yeah, there are a couple
minor differences

40:14.760 --> 40:16.762
- I can think of.
- Yeah, true. [chuckles]

40:16.805 --> 40:19.068
Still though, that was
an amazing time wasn't it?

40:19.112 --> 40:21.462
Me you, Rajesh, Magnus...

40:21.506 --> 40:23.246
Oh, those were the days.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.900
Before girls got involved.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.380
Saying that,
wasn't that the trip

40:26.424 --> 40:28.034
where I snogged three girls?

40:28.077 --> 40:29.949
- Oh, God, here we go.
- Yeah.

40:29.992 --> 40:31.646
You did not snog
three girls on that trip.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.648
That was the trip
where I snogged the triplets.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.128
The--
Oh, they are triplets now.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.608
- Yeah--
- Unbelievable, dude.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.000
You just keep
adding to the story.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.175
No, they've always
been triplets.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.003
Dude, we were 12 years old,

40:41.047 --> 40:42.875
the teacher was watching us
the entire time.

40:42.918 --> 40:43.789
No.

40:43.832 --> 40:44.964
Oh, fuck.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.356
It's a roadblock.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.923
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

40:47.967 --> 40:49.925
Just be calm,
be calm, bro, it's fine.

40:49.969 --> 40:51.797
Kind hard to be calm though,
Bav, when I've got

40:51.840 --> 40:53.886
200,000 pounds of cocaine
strapped to my testicles.

40:53.929 --> 40:57.106
Look, they're pulling cars over,
they're talking to people.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.631
- Oh, fuck, we're so dead.
- We're not dead.
Stop doing that face.

40:59.674 --> 41:00.893
- Oh, God, these guys
are pulling us over.
- Stop doing that face.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.068
- What face?
- That stupid

41:02.111 --> 41:03.330
"I'm a guilty drug smuggler"
face.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.636
What are you talking about,
this is my face!

41:04.679 --> 41:05.941
[Bav] Maybe we should just
turn ourselves in?

41:05.985 --> 41:07.421
[Adam] What the fuck
are you talking about?

41:07.465 --> 41:08.770
They threatened to hurt Sarah
if we get caught.

41:08.814 --> 41:10.729
[Bav] Okay, that's true.
It's going to be fine.

41:10.772 --> 41:12.905
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.345
Hi, Officer.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.522
Can I ask what is your purpose

41:21.566 --> 41:23.306
for coming into Slovenia?

41:23.350 --> 41:25.613
We're on holiday.

41:25.657 --> 41:28.268
Yeah, honeymoon.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.792
- [stuttering]
- Not ours.

41:30.836 --> 41:34.361
No. There's nothing
wrong with that,
if you are that.

41:34.404 --> 41:37.146
Um, but his honeymoon,
with his wife.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.452
Bella.

41:39.279 --> 41:40.323
But she's not here.

41:40.367 --> 41:43.457
No. No, she is not here,

41:43.501 --> 41:47.026
she is... she's back in Venezia.

41:47.069 --> 41:48.854
[both] Venice.

41:48.897 --> 41:52.640
So, you came with your wife
on your honeymoon,

41:52.684 --> 41:55.208
and you go on a trip with him?

41:56.035 --> 41:58.037
I know-- it's weird.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.126
[chuckles]
You can imagine my wife,

42:00.169 --> 42:01.214
how angry she is about it.

42:01.257 --> 42:03.303
[both laughing]

42:03.346 --> 42:07.786
Are you bringing through
any contraband goods?

42:07.829 --> 42:09.614
- No.
- Animals?

42:09.657 --> 42:10.615
No, no, no.

42:10.658 --> 42:13.618
- Drugs?
- Drugs?

42:13.661 --> 42:15.620
Oh, no.

42:15.663 --> 42:17.665
How... I have never ever,

42:17.709 --> 42:21.321
ever touched a drug
in my life, ever.

42:21.364 --> 42:23.802
- Right.
- [stutters] Okay, you know,

42:23.845 --> 42:26.500
I once, once
did coke by accident.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.459
It was my friend, hit me with--
and it went in my--

42:29.503 --> 42:31.984
But, uh... is alcohol a drug?

42:32.027 --> 42:34.726
Because alcohol,
okay, I've done alcohol before.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.728
Yeah, because people do
consider it a drug, technically.

42:36.771 --> 42:39.034
Well, then lock me up
and throw away the key, but...

42:39.078 --> 42:40.862
Illegal, illegal drugs?

42:40.906 --> 42:42.821
Never ever in my life,
I swear to God.

42:42.864 --> 42:44.387
I swear to...

42:46.476 --> 42:49.567
Could you pull the car over
to the side please, sir?

42:49.610 --> 42:52.613
Officer, I would really like to
apologize for my friend.

42:52.657 --> 42:55.921
He has problems with his brain.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.968
Pull the car over there, please.

43:00.012 --> 43:03.406
Right, yeah,
of course, no problem.

43:03.450 --> 43:05.713
[Adam shuddering]

43:07.846 --> 43:09.761
- What the fuck was that, bro?
- I was trying to throw him

43:09.804 --> 43:11.414
- off the scent, okay?
- You fuckin' managed to
spray the scent

43:11.458 --> 43:14.026
- all over his fucking face!
- What do we do now?

43:14.069 --> 43:16.550
[Adam]
We're just gonna be really calm
and do exactly what he says.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.031
- Please step out of the car.
- Yes, coming.

43:19.074 --> 43:20.119
- Coming.
- Coming.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.614
Bav! What the fuck!

43:36.657 --> 43:39.007
Dude, you've got fucking coke
pouring out of you!

43:39.051 --> 43:43.359
- Oh, God.
- Just lift your arm
and hold it up, Jesus.

43:43.403 --> 43:44.752
[whispers indistinct]

43:49.322 --> 43:51.280
Could you come with me,
please?

43:52.020 --> 43:53.369
- Why?
- Where?

43:53.413 --> 43:55.067
Come with me.

43:55.110 --> 43:57.025
Oh, God. Oh, God.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.696
Is there a problem, Officer?

44:15.740 --> 44:18.177
Yes, we have a problem.

44:20.614 --> 44:23.617
You don't have
the appropriate pass

44:23.661 --> 44:25.445
to be driving in Slovenia.

44:25.488 --> 44:28.753
You need
a Vignette Toll Sticker.

44:28.796 --> 44:30.015
- Oh, thank God.
- [Adam slaps Bav's leg]

44:30.058 --> 44:31.843
I just have to sign it.

44:37.631 --> 44:39.589
- Do you need a pen?
- Oh, yes.

44:39.633 --> 44:40.416
Ah.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.288
I have a-- actually.

44:42.331 --> 44:43.463
He has a pen.

44:45.770 --> 44:47.380
[whispering indistinct]

44:47.423 --> 44:49.338
Oh, my God, I feel so alive.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.126
- [officer] Excuse me!
- He's onto us, he's onto us!

44:54.169 --> 44:55.475
Shit, why is he
coming after us?

44:55.518 --> 44:57.390
- Fuck, he must have seen...
- Excuse me!

44:57.433 --> 44:59.044
...some of the fucking coke
coming out my sleeve.

44:59.087 --> 45:00.654
[Adam] We're gonna go to jail,
and they're going to kill Sarah.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.917
He's coming!
Quick, quick, quick!
Press the fucking gas!

45:02.961 --> 45:05.398
I'm going--
I'm going as fast as I can!

45:05.441 --> 45:08.227
[indistinct]
God, what the fuck, man!

45:08.270 --> 45:09.837
- Oh, God.
- [Bav] Quick, quick!

45:09.881 --> 45:11.273
- [Adam] Oh, my God.
- [Bav] Oh, God!

45:11.317 --> 45:13.623
[rock music playing]

45:15.060 --> 45:17.715
[mutters] Oh, God.
Is he behind us?

45:17.758 --> 45:19.586
I don't think so!
Just keep driving!

45:19.629 --> 45:20.935
[Adam] What do I do now?!

45:20.979 --> 45:22.371
- You see that sign road, yeah?
- Yeah.

45:22.415 --> 45:23.677
[Bav] Drift into there!

45:23.721 --> 45:25.461
Drift into--
I'm not fucking Vin Diesel.

45:25.505 --> 45:27.942
Do a 230 degree turn
at three o'clock.

45:27.986 --> 45:29.161
Do a 230 degree turn
at three o'clock?

45:29.204 --> 45:30.815
What the fuck
are you talking about?

45:30.858 --> 45:33.078
- There's no fucking time!
- I'm doing it!

45:33.121 --> 45:35.210
[both yelling]

45:35.254 --> 45:37.735
[coughing]

45:37.778 --> 45:40.781
There you go, good boy,
good boy.

45:41.521 --> 45:43.828
Oh, get it all out.

45:43.871 --> 45:46.091
Better out than in,
that's what my mum
always used to say.

45:46.134 --> 45:48.397
Fuck off!

45:48.441 --> 45:49.529
[groans]

45:53.402 --> 45:55.709
Okay, I think that's it.

46:02.150 --> 46:04.239
What the hell are you doing?!

46:04.283 --> 46:07.155
- I'm burning the car.
- Why?

46:07.199 --> 46:09.157
- Have you never seen
any movie, ever?
- [lighter flicking]

46:09.201 --> 46:11.116
They've got our license plate,
okay.

46:11.159 --> 46:12.682
This is evidence
we need to get rid of!

46:12.726 --> 46:14.815
Plus, it's got our DNA
all over it, you Muppet!

46:14.859 --> 46:16.904
- No, no, no, no.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

46:16.948 --> 46:19.472
- Fucking run!
- Oh, my God!

46:20.212 --> 46:21.256
Bav.

46:23.432 --> 46:24.651
A problem?

46:30.744 --> 46:31.963
You know what?

46:33.051 --> 46:34.487
Why don't you take your time?

46:34.530 --> 46:36.271
Spend the night there.

46:37.098 --> 46:38.143
Yeah, cool!

46:38.186 --> 46:40.449
[laughing]

46:40.493 --> 46:42.974
Yeah. No, no, no.

46:43.017 --> 46:44.845
No, no, understood.
No, no, understood.

46:44.889 --> 46:46.151
Yeah, sorry, yeah.

46:46.194 --> 46:48.196
Okay, thank you, bye.

46:50.285 --> 46:51.983
Was Sarah okay?

46:52.026 --> 46:54.942
Um... yeah, probably,
I don't know I didn't ask.

46:54.986 --> 46:57.684
Giorgio is cool though,
he's in good spirits.

46:57.727 --> 46:59.947
He said that we could
drop the stuff off
tomorrow morning,

46:59.991 --> 47:03.037
so, he's given us this place
that we can stay overnight.

47:04.343 --> 47:06.432
- Overnight?!
- Yeah, sorry, um...

47:06.475 --> 47:07.737
Jesus Christ.

47:07.781 --> 47:09.043
He also said that

47:09.087 --> 47:11.959
if we mess this up
we're both dead.

47:12.003 --> 47:13.569
I mean, he didn't
say it like that, you know,

47:13.613 --> 47:15.049
he said it in a Giorgio way,
you know, what he's like,

47:15.093 --> 47:17.530
so charming.
That was the crux of it.

47:17.573 --> 47:19.445
So where is this place
we're supposed to stay at?

47:19.488 --> 47:23.101
- Fourteen miles away.
- Fourteen miles?!

47:23.144 --> 47:25.364
We're meant to walk 14 miles?

47:25.407 --> 47:27.322
That's alright.
We'll just take it step by step.

47:27.366 --> 47:28.541
[thunder rumbles softly]

47:28.584 --> 47:30.195
[rain pattering]

47:37.463 --> 47:38.464
[knocking on door]

47:38.507 --> 47:39.508
Hello!

47:39.552 --> 47:41.032
Hello!

47:43.686 --> 47:44.774
Oh.

47:44.818 --> 47:48.561
Hi, sorry.

47:48.604 --> 47:51.825
Uh... Giorgio sent us.

47:51.869 --> 47:52.913
[woman spits]

48:07.928 --> 48:09.234
Oh.

48:11.627 --> 48:13.542
- Hello.
- Hiya.

48:13.586 --> 48:14.761
[man spits]

48:15.893 --> 48:17.242
Okay.

48:17.285 --> 48:19.984
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

48:20.027 --> 48:21.333
Thank you, madam.

48:24.727 --> 48:25.903
God...

48:26.642 --> 48:27.643
[woman spits]

48:31.952 --> 48:34.259
[exhales]
What the hell was that?

48:34.302 --> 48:35.521
What was with all the spitting.

48:35.564 --> 48:38.219
- Why was she spitting so much?
- Bro...

48:38.263 --> 48:39.438
There's only one bed.

48:39.481 --> 48:40.700
We can just 69 it,

48:40.743 --> 48:41.831
like we used to do
when we were kids.

48:41.875 --> 48:43.268
You mean top and tails?

48:43.311 --> 48:45.531
Yeah, top and tails,
69, same thing.

48:45.574 --> 48:47.272
- You know what I mean.
- It's not the same thing.

48:47.315 --> 48:48.577
Alright, whatever.
Okay, listen,

48:48.621 --> 48:49.404
I'm just gonna go to
the bathroom, alright.

48:49.448 --> 48:50.884
Okay.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.755
Don't take too long.

48:52.799 --> 48:53.669
Yeah.

48:57.282 --> 48:58.500
[exhales]

48:59.849 --> 49:02.330
Bav, I'm gonna
need some help.

49:02.374 --> 49:03.897
Okay. Are you sure?

49:03.941 --> 49:05.377
Yeah.

49:05.420 --> 49:06.552
- Alright.
- Okay.

49:06.595 --> 49:07.727
- Ready?
- Yeah.

49:07.770 --> 49:08.728
- Three...
- On three.

49:08.771 --> 49:10.121
...two, one. Go!

49:10.164 --> 49:11.905
- [tape ripping]
- [groaning]

49:11.949 --> 49:13.167
Okay, on three.

49:13.211 --> 49:14.168
[groaning]

49:14.212 --> 49:17.128
- One, two....
- Ooh, fuck me!

49:18.912 --> 49:21.697
Okay, okay,
you want me to do you now?

49:21.741 --> 49:24.526
Nah, I'm probably gonna go
to the bathroom,

49:24.570 --> 49:26.876
the hot water,
the steam will help it
come off really easily.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.140
Otherwise you get that.
[chuckles]

49:29.183 --> 49:31.011
What? How?

49:31.881 --> 49:33.361
Why didn't you tell me?

49:36.103 --> 49:38.192
[exhales]

49:45.939 --> 49:47.985
[farting]

49:50.944 --> 49:52.250
[inhales sharply]

49:53.251 --> 49:54.382
Mm.

50:04.871 --> 50:05.915
Fuck.

50:11.182 --> 50:13.227
[Adam] Everything okay?
You were in there for a while.

50:13.271 --> 50:14.489
Yeah, yeah, all good.

50:14.533 --> 50:16.535
Got the tape off
nice and easy, did you?

50:16.578 --> 50:18.798
Yeah. Came on, off....

50:18.841 --> 50:20.452
Right.

50:20.495 --> 50:22.845
- Bav, what are you doing?
- You know I always sleep naked.

50:22.889 --> 50:24.804
Not in this tiny bed
with me in it, you're not.

50:24.847 --> 50:25.979
- Oh, my God.
- Put some clothes on.

50:26.023 --> 50:27.024
Alright.

50:29.374 --> 50:30.984
I can't believe I should have
been with Sarah

50:31.028 --> 50:32.725
in that beautiful hotel
right now.

50:32.768 --> 50:35.510
Instead I'm in the worst hotel
on the planet.

50:42.822 --> 50:45.651
Is it really bad to admit
that I'm not having
the worst time?

50:45.694 --> 50:49.872
I mean... [sighs]
It's kinda, like, nice
to spend some time together,

50:49.916 --> 50:53.311
some real you and me time,
we haven't done that for ages.

50:53.354 --> 50:54.660
Do you know what I was
thinking about, Adam?

50:54.703 --> 50:56.749
I was thinking about
our Geography teacher.

50:56.792 --> 50:58.229
What was his name?
Mr. Barker.

50:59.317 --> 51:01.014
- Weirdo Beardo.
- Weirdo Beardo.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.365
Yeah, 'cause he was weird,
and he had a beard.
[chuckles]

51:04.409 --> 51:06.846
Oh, my God, do you remember
when you put something
on his seat and he sat on it?

51:06.889 --> 51:09.022
What was it,
was it a hair brush?
A hair brush?

51:09.066 --> 51:11.590
- It was a pine cone.
- Pine cone! [laughs]

51:11.633 --> 51:13.331
That was amazing!

51:13.374 --> 51:16.508
Oh, my God, you were in
so much trouble that year.

51:16.551 --> 51:18.075
If they'd found out it was you

51:18.118 --> 51:20.164
they'd probably would have
kicked you out of school.

51:20.207 --> 51:22.035
And you took the blame for me,
didn't you?

51:22.079 --> 51:23.993
Yeah.
I got one week detention.

51:24.951 --> 51:27.084
Why'd you do that, Bav?

51:27.127 --> 51:29.434
Why'd you take
the blame for me?

51:29.477 --> 51:32.393
What do you mean, why?
Am I your best friend?

51:41.315 --> 51:42.447
Oh, hi.

51:42.490 --> 51:43.448
Hello.

51:43.491 --> 51:44.840
Excuse me?

51:48.583 --> 51:49.584
Ivan.

51:49.628 --> 51:52.761
- Okay, yeah.
- Oh.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.937
I think you may have
come into the wrong room?

51:56.635 --> 51:58.898
Uh, the wrong...

51:58.941 --> 52:02.206
I think you may have
come into the wrong room.

52:02.249 --> 52:03.511
Mr. Ivan.

52:04.947 --> 52:06.645
'Cause we're-- we're stay--

52:09.996 --> 52:12.390
[snorting]
[spits]

52:19.048 --> 52:21.268
[snoring]

52:28.275 --> 52:29.929
Good morning, my dear.

52:29.972 --> 52:31.757
Did you sleep well?

52:32.584 --> 52:34.020
Weirdly, no.

52:34.063 --> 52:35.674
Me neither.

52:35.717 --> 52:37.197
But I got inspired.

52:38.111 --> 52:39.504
I drew something for you.

52:50.428 --> 52:51.559
Cool.

52:59.785 --> 53:04.529
Please, have some breakfast
and then I planned
a little trip for us.

53:04.572 --> 53:07.271
- What kind of trip?
- I promise
that you will like it.

53:07.314 --> 53:09.795
And we'll be back in time
for Adam and Bav.

53:11.623 --> 53:15.366
- [snoring]
- [rooster crows]

53:15.409 --> 53:17.716
[groaning]

53:19.587 --> 53:21.067
[Adam] Get off.

53:22.460 --> 53:24.331
Get off of me!

53:24.375 --> 53:26.942
Oh, shit, sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.

53:28.335 --> 53:30.598
Jesus Christ,
you weigh a ton!

53:30.642 --> 53:32.252
It's just the Christmas weight.

53:32.296 --> 53:34.123
Christmas weight, it's July!

53:34.167 --> 53:35.864
Alright, I haven't
shed it yet, alright.

53:35.908 --> 53:37.257
Don't body shame me!

53:39.041 --> 53:41.000
Jesus, Bav.

53:41.043 --> 53:42.915
- What?
- Do you have a boner?

53:42.958 --> 53:44.482
It's a morning boner.

53:44.525 --> 53:47.224
It's not for you,
don't flatter yourself, mate!

53:48.747 --> 53:51.619
At least that weirdo's gone
and didn't kill us in the night.

53:52.968 --> 53:54.753
Hey, Bav!

53:54.796 --> 53:56.102
By the time I get back
from the bathroom

53:56.145 --> 53:57.451
I want that thing gone.

54:03.675 --> 54:04.676
[Ivan sniffs]

54:13.380 --> 54:14.860
What the hell?

54:17.123 --> 54:21.170
Okay, well, thank you
so much for having us.

54:21.214 --> 54:22.781
- Really appre--
- [blows raspberry]

54:22.824 --> 54:25.653
- Oh?
- [sputtering]

54:27.699 --> 54:29.353
Yeah, uh...

54:29.396 --> 54:30.528
[spits]

54:32.965 --> 54:34.358
Yeah.

54:34.401 --> 54:37.796
And, uh, it was
a very pleasant stay, and...

54:38.840 --> 54:39.841
[spits]

54:40.581 --> 54:41.800
So thank you.

54:43.541 --> 54:45.543
Yeah, okay, thank you!

54:46.195 --> 54:47.327
[spits]

54:50.461 --> 54:51.940
[door closes]

54:55.379 --> 54:56.902
- [Bav] Adam, Adam!
- Okay.

54:56.945 --> 54:58.425
- Bav?
- Great news!

54:58.469 --> 55:00.209
I've got Ivan
to take us to the drop off.

55:00.253 --> 55:01.907
- Really, that's great news?
- It's better than walking.

55:01.950 --> 55:03.474
I guess. How'd you get him
to agree to that?

55:03.517 --> 55:05.127
I told him you were gonna
give him 500 euros.

55:05.171 --> 55:06.651
- Okay? Come on, let's go!
- Five hundred euros?

55:06.694 --> 55:08.392
How'd you get--
How'd you get to 500 euros?

55:08.435 --> 55:10.307
[Bav] I started on 800,
I hammered it down.

55:13.397 --> 55:15.529
Hey, Ivan, how's it going?

55:15.573 --> 55:18.010
Thank you, okay,
maybe we can talk about the...

55:18.053 --> 55:19.794
There's no front seat, huh?

55:20.795 --> 55:22.101
Really?

55:22.144 --> 55:23.581
This was 500 euros?

55:23.624 --> 55:25.278
This car's not worth
500 euros!

55:25.322 --> 55:27.585
[groans] What is that smell?
I can't breathe.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.675
I think it's coming from this.

55:30.718 --> 55:32.329
Hey, it's Ivan's
shitty underpants.

55:32.372 --> 55:35.114
Oh, God. Why would he have a bag
of shitty underpants?

55:35.157 --> 55:36.071
Ooh.

55:42.077 --> 55:45.124
- [engine starts]
- [loud rock music
playing on stereo]

55:52.827 --> 55:53.872
Um...

55:57.615 --> 55:59.921
This place is closed.

56:01.183 --> 56:02.359
Not for me.

56:04.883 --> 56:06.798
[dramatic music playing]

56:09.496 --> 56:10.584
Really?

56:15.937 --> 56:17.896
[rock music continues]

56:17.939 --> 56:19.114
[Adam] Ivan!

56:19.854 --> 56:21.203
- Ivan!
- What?

56:21.247 --> 56:23.336
Can you please
turn the music down?

56:26.861 --> 56:28.428
[music stops]

56:28.472 --> 56:29.690
Thank you.

56:32.258 --> 56:34.129
Adam, I had a really
weird dream last night.

56:34.173 --> 56:36.393
- I don't know
if I should tell you about.
- Don't tell me then.

56:36.436 --> 56:38.177
- But I feel like
you should know.
- Okay then.

56:38.220 --> 56:39.918
I just don't wanna
hurt your feelings though.

56:39.961 --> 56:41.485
Fine, so don't tell me.

56:41.528 --> 56:43.138
Yeah, but then I feel like
I'm holding stuff back from you,

56:43.182 --> 56:44.226
and you know
we don't have secrets.

56:44.270 --> 56:45.489
Bav, just tell me
or don't tell me.

56:45.532 --> 56:46.664
I really don't give a fuck.

56:46.707 --> 56:49.231
- Alright, I'll tell you.
- God.

56:49.275 --> 56:53.584
So, last night,
I had a dream about Sarah.

56:53.627 --> 56:57.196
And Giorgio was shagging her,
from behind.

56:57.239 --> 57:00.068
I mean, he was giving her
proper seeing to.

57:00.112 --> 57:01.592
Then, all of a sudden,

57:01.635 --> 57:03.855
she started asking for me.

57:03.898 --> 57:05.378
Jesus Christ.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.075
And I didn't wanna join in,
I really didn't,

57:07.119 --> 57:09.643
but Sarah absolutely insisted.

57:09.687 --> 57:12.080
And then me and Giorgio
were both doing her

57:12.124 --> 57:14.735
in every way imaginable,

57:14.779 --> 57:17.216
and that's why I had
that boner this morning.

57:17.259 --> 57:18.609
For fuck's sake, Bav.

57:18.652 --> 57:19.827
What the hell
is wrong with you?

57:19.871 --> 57:21.046
Well, I can't control my dreams.

57:21.089 --> 57:22.003
- I--
- Sorry!

57:22.047 --> 57:23.570
But don't tell me about them!

57:23.614 --> 57:25.964
Just keep 'em private.

57:29.794 --> 57:32.100
[classical music playing]

57:36.844 --> 57:37.932
Wow!

57:47.246 --> 57:49.814
No one had to be killed
for this to happen, right?

57:49.857 --> 57:50.815
No.

57:52.425 --> 57:53.426
Good.

57:56.342 --> 57:57.517
[clears throat]

58:10.312 --> 58:12.271
God, I love Tintoretto.

58:15.317 --> 58:18.059
Does Adam
share your love of art?

58:18.103 --> 58:20.975
He tries, but, not really.

58:21.019 --> 58:22.716
What does he do for a living?

58:22.760 --> 58:24.544
He's a marketing manager.

58:24.588 --> 58:26.851
Is that exciting?

58:26.894 --> 58:28.461
Exciting?

58:28.505 --> 58:32.509
I guess not, but at least
he's not a fucking criminal.

58:35.642 --> 58:37.383
[rock music playing]

58:44.912 --> 58:46.958
I need to use the toilet, da?

58:50.918 --> 58:52.006
[grunts]

59:00.145 --> 59:01.015
Oh!

59:02.539 --> 59:04.105
- [groans]
- [Bav] Oh, God.

59:05.542 --> 59:06.760
[exhales]

59:07.892 --> 59:08.980
That's pungent!

59:13.158 --> 59:14.986
Hey, listen, bro, I just...

59:15.029 --> 59:17.423
You know when we do the drop,
if anything happens to us--

59:17.466 --> 59:19.033
- Don't talk like that, Bav.
- No, no, no,

59:19.077 --> 59:20.295
I'm just saying,
like, if they kill us

59:20.339 --> 59:21.601
or they chop our heads off
or anything,

59:21.645 --> 59:23.647
I just want to let you
to know that, like,

59:23.690 --> 59:25.300
I couldn't have asked for
a better best friend.

59:25.344 --> 59:28.390
Okay, well, good to know.
Anyway, nothing's gonna happen.

59:28.434 --> 59:32.046
We're just gonna
give them the drugs,
take the money and that's it.

59:32.090 --> 59:33.961
Yeah, you're probably right.

59:34.005 --> 59:35.180
Although...

59:36.224 --> 59:37.530
Although?

59:37.574 --> 59:39.445
You should--
you should probably know that

59:39.488 --> 59:44.450
there might be a...
slight problem with the drugs.

59:44.493 --> 59:46.931
What slight problem
with the drugs?

59:46.974 --> 59:49.063
So, you know, when I was
having a bath yesterday,
and I was,

59:49.107 --> 59:50.587
like, you know, trying to
get all the drug packaging--

59:50.630 --> 59:52.284
some of the water
seeped into the drug packaging,

59:52.327 --> 59:54.112
and some of it, it's...

59:54.155 --> 59:57.463
quite a lot of it's...
quite fucked.

59:59.073 --> 59:59.987
What?

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:05.602
Sorry, it-it...

01:00:06.167 --> 01:00:07.342
It kinda....

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.084
Yeah, I'm really sorry,

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.695
it's kind of like
mixed with the water

01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:14.393
it's kinda turn it into like
a weird kind of mush.

01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:16.613
- What the fuck, Bav!
- I'm sorry!

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:18.615
- What the fuck!
- Your half is still okay!

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.399
- Yeah, but we need all of it!
- Okay, it's fine--

01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:21.748
What are we going to do?
What are they gonna say

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:24.272
- when they see this?
- I've thought about it.

01:00:24.316 --> 01:00:26.535
- What have you come up with?
- Nothing, I've just
thought about it!

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:29.060
- Oh, my God!
- Relax, relax,
I'll take care of it!

01:00:29.103 --> 01:00:30.801
Oh, yeah, you're--
you're gonna take care of it?

01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:33.107
I'll handle it!
Stop being so fucking neurotic!

01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:34.456
Oh, I'm being neurotic?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.024
Yeah, you big,
fucking neurotic freak!

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:42.116
[upbeat music playing]

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.031
Don't...
Don't even think about it!

01:00:44.075 --> 01:00:45.424
Don't do it!

01:00:45.467 --> 01:00:47.339
Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:52.561
- [groans]
- Yeah, it hurts!

01:00:55.086 --> 01:00:56.261
Hey, hey!

01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:58.089
- [yelling]
- [laughing]

01:00:58.132 --> 01:00:59.481
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop!

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:01.440
Stop! Stop it!

01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:02.920
Are you using the good stuff?

01:01:02.963 --> 01:01:04.008
I might have been.

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:05.313
What, are you fucking crazy?

01:01:05.357 --> 01:01:06.924
Well, you fucking started it!

01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:08.490
Oh, did I? Sorry.

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:16.368
How was your shit?

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.500
Let's go.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.859
[Adam] Well, now we are
completely fucked.

01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:31.209
- [Bav]
You're the one who threw it.
- [Adam] Shut up, just shut up.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.955
My mother used to take me

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:40.044
to see all
the Renaissance artists.

01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:44.962
If things had been different,
I might have been a painter.

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.399
Why didn't you?

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:51.925
My father wanted me to
take on the family business.

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.753
And you couldn't say no to him?

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:58.105
He's not an easy man
to say no to.

01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:01.718
Must be hard having your life
controlled like that.

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:04.198
You might have
all the money in the world,

01:02:04.242 --> 01:02:06.287
but if you
don't have the freedom

01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:10.074
to be who you wanna be,
what good is it?

01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:24.697
Come, I have
another surprise for you.

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:38.406
[exclaims]

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.757
What the absolute fuck.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.281
This is my favorite place
in all of Venezia.

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:45.631
Do you like it?

01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:47.851
How could I not like it?
It's phenomenal.

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:58.644
By the way, I spoke to
the curator of the gallery.

01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:03.301
Anything you want
for your exhibition in London,
it's yours.

01:03:05.607 --> 01:03:07.566
Why are you doing all this?

01:03:11.048 --> 01:03:13.833
Just want to make up
for everything that's happened.

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.798
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:23.712
I have a quick phone call
to make.

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:31.720
[speaking Italian]

01:03:46.518 --> 01:03:47.954
[Bav] I don't like
the look of this place.

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:49.564
Maybe we should go home.

01:03:49.608 --> 01:03:51.175
[Adam] And what about Sarah,
we just leave her with Giorgio?

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.393
[Bav] Adam, you know what,
you can just get another wife,

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:53.481
you can find someone else.

01:03:53.525 --> 01:03:54.700
[Adam]
Bav, we are going in there

01:03:54.743 --> 01:03:56.528
to deliver the drugs
and get the money.

01:03:56.571 --> 01:03:58.573
[groans]
[sniffing]

01:03:59.879 --> 01:04:01.141
Oh, fuck.

01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:05.885
- Come on, then.
- You want me to come, as well?

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:08.105
Yeah, of course, you're coming!
You're the whole fucking reason
we're in this mess.

01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:09.933
Maybe you take Ivan instead.

01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:11.978
What, why would I take Ivan?

01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:14.546
We kinda look the same
and, you know, he's...

01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:16.113
he's got less to lose than me.

01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:17.679
Bav, get the fuck
out of the car.

01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:18.724
Alright!

01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:19.812
Fuck!

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.337
Oh, fuck.

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:24.643
Ivan, just wait here,
we'll be, like,

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:26.210
- five minutes, alright?
- [Ivan] Da.

01:04:28.603 --> 01:04:31.606
Oh, fuck.
This is fucking nuts, man.

01:04:33.043 --> 01:04:34.914
How the fuck are we
gonna convince those guys

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.350
to take that bag of shit?

01:04:36.394 --> 01:04:37.830
It's alright.
We've still got some of it.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.353
I think it's gonna be alright.
You know what,

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:40.833
I feel weirdly
confident about this.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.313
Yeah, you feel confident
because a ton of that cocaine

01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:43.488
went up your nose.

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:44.663
Oh, Jesus Christ, it's the guy.

01:04:44.706 --> 01:04:46.360
- Just act normal.
- Yeah.

01:04:47.448 --> 01:04:49.929
Hello, we were sent by Giorgio.

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:51.278
Giorgio sent us.

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.983
My God, what is this place?

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.508
It's alright,
it's going to be okay.

01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.639
It's going to be alright.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.299
[speaking Slovenian]

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:19.611
Maybe we should just come clean.

01:05:19.654 --> 01:05:22.135
Shh, I've got a plan,
just relax.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:23.789
Just let me-- let me take this,
let me lead.

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:25.138
- What are you gonna say?
- Let me lead!

01:05:25.182 --> 01:05:26.357
- What are you gonna say?
- Chill, just chill.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.619
Stop being cool...

01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:28.968
You got the stuff?

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:31.840
Yeah. I've got the stuff.

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:36.149
But, can I just
ask you a question?

01:05:37.803 --> 01:05:41.546
- Do you really need
all this cocaine?
- What?

01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:44.636
I mean, you know what
this does to people, right?

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:47.334
You know it ruins
people's lives.

01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:48.379
Yeah?

01:05:48.422 --> 01:05:50.250
I mean, and for what?

01:05:50.294 --> 01:05:51.730
For money?

01:05:51.773 --> 01:05:53.514
For a new car?

01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:56.430
Shiny new gun?

01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:58.041
- I mean...
- What are you doing, man?

01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:00.391
You can make a change
in your life right now.

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:03.350
When you were a little bambino,
did you say, "When I grow up,

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:05.396
I wanna be a gangster?"

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:08.790
- No, I wanted to be a soldier.
- Yes!

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:11.793
You see, that is
a noble profession.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:14.100
That's because
I wanted to kill people.

01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.972
[both] Ah.

01:06:16.015 --> 01:06:17.886
Now, give me bag.

01:06:18.757 --> 01:06:20.106
Give him the bag, Bav.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.239
Give me bag.

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:24.719
Give him the bag, Bav.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.766
I don't want to
give you the bag.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:29.463
Give me the fucking bag!

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:30.551
Yeah, sure.

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:35.426
Okay, so....

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:42.346
- What is this shit?!
- [Bav] Okay, okay,
let me explain,

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:44.652
that's the new--
The new cocaina on the street,

01:06:44.696 --> 01:06:46.089
- all the kids are doing it.
- [Adam] Chocolate sprinkles.

01:06:46.132 --> 01:06:48.830
That's cocaina 2.0--
they call it chocolate chip.

01:06:48.874 --> 01:06:50.789
- That's right.
- It has pieces of black...

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:52.051
- Chocolate chips...
- ...chocolate chips...

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.357
You are gonna make
so much money off--

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.967
We tried some,
it's really good shit.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.577
It's like-- I rubbed it all--
It was really, good stuff.

01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:58.579
- You want to fuck me?!
- Fuck you?

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.320
- We don't want to fuck you.
- No, absolutely not, sir.

01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:01.278
We do not wanna fuck you.

01:07:01.321 --> 01:07:02.844
We just had a little mishap,

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:04.890
and we're doing the best we can
to salvage the situation.

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.544
So, here's-- let me explain.

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:09.460
My friend, right,
he got some of that coke wet,

01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:10.722
'cause it was--
Long story, right?

01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:12.463
You threw it,
he threw it at me.

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.030
- No, well, we didn't--
- He threw the coke--

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:15.640
- No, don't blame me now..
- Just-- don't...

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:16.684
- [gun cocks]
- Don't blame me now.

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:18.251
- Shut up!
- Okay, okay.

01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:22.473
[tense music playing]

01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:26.085
Oh, God, please, please.

01:07:29.784 --> 01:07:30.916
- Please!
- [whimpering]

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:32.744
[Adam] Okay.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.702
[police yelling in Italian]

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.104
[groans]

01:07:48.412 --> 01:07:49.674
[gasping]

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:50.892
Oh, fuck!

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:53.460
What the fuck was that?

01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:55.071
I think I can see Ivan's car.
Come on!

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:56.637
No, no, no, no!
We need to get the money!

01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:57.986
What the fuck
you talking about money?

01:07:58.030 --> 01:07:59.031
It's a fucking warzone
out there!

01:07:59.075 --> 01:07:59.945
We need to get the money
for Giorgio

01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:01.512
so that he'll let Sarah go!

01:08:01.555 --> 01:08:03.079
That's the fucking coke
in your system!

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:05.385
Come on, let's fucking go!
[yelling]

01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:06.734
[rapid gunfire]

01:08:11.826 --> 01:08:13.219
[Bav] Adam!

01:08:16.613 --> 01:08:18.006
Come on!

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:19.529
Hurry up!

01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:24.100
Adam!

01:08:27.363 --> 01:08:29.627
Oh, my fucking God!
That was fucking amazing!

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:31.890
Come on, let's go!
You've been shot.

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:33.020
- You've been shot!
- Oh, fuck!

01:08:33.064 --> 01:08:34.761
Don't worry,
I'll suck the bullet out.

01:08:34.805 --> 01:08:38.069
What, what? Why?

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.812
[groans] I think it just
grazed you, you lucky bastard.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:42.466
I really wish
I hadn't done that now.

01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:43.728
- Okay, we gotta go.
- Okay.

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.731
- Come on, now, let's go.
- Alright!

01:08:46.774 --> 01:08:48.645
[groans] Oh, come on,
I can't get through!

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.212
- It's the Christmas weight!
- Come on, now.

01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:51.823
- [grunts]
- Get it through there, buddy!

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:53.912
Come on!

01:08:54.782 --> 01:08:56.609
Come on!

01:08:56.654 --> 01:09:00.919
- [yells]
- Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:01.920
Bav?

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:04.749
- Oh, my God, Bav!
- [groans]

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:08.187
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:10.233
- [groans]
- Sorry!

01:09:15.325 --> 01:09:16.194
Go!

01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:21.809
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:24.160
- Come on! Come on!
- It's too much!

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.161
- What are you doing?!
- It's too much!

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.553
- Why are you stopping?
- I can't!

01:09:26.596 --> 01:09:27.728
- Stop, what are you doing?!
- Go on, leave me.

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:29.339
What the fuck are you doing?
Come on!

01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:31.906
- Goddamn it! Oh, my God!
- It's too much!

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:33.125
It's too much!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.214
[rock music blaring]

01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:37.999
[grunting]

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:39.523
[dramatic music playing]

01:09:42.308 --> 01:09:43.353
Oh, shit!

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:45.442
[yells]

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:46.617
Oh, God!

01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:50.621
He's shooting!

01:09:55.843 --> 01:09:57.105
Step on the fucking gas!

01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:58.759
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.545
- Oh!
- [grunts]

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.940
Oh! Oh, God.

01:10:05.984 --> 01:10:07.986
Oh, my God.

01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:09.161
Go, Ivan, go.

01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:14.645
[Bav groans]

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.213
We did it.

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:19.215
- We actually did it.
- Yes, we did!

01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:21.347
We fucking did it, bro!

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:23.654
[Adam laughs]

01:10:23.697 --> 01:10:25.351
- [Bav] Oh, God.
- [Adam] Oh, God.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:30.356
Ivan? To Venice!

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.318
I had a few dresses brought in

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:38.146
in case you
wanted to change for dinner.

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.670
Only if you want, of course.

01:10:47.678 --> 01:10:49.593
[speaking Italian]

01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:12.833
For fuck's sake.

01:11:15.053 --> 01:11:17.055
[dramatic music playing]

01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:42.950
Alright.

01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:44.474
Hey, thanks so much, Ivan.

01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:46.650
And, uh, you know, just...

01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:50.175
good luck with all
the life stuff.

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:53.961
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you.

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:56.747
Let's go, Bav.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:57.835
Bring the bag.

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.924
Yep.
Bye, Ivan!

01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:05.451
Good luck, good friend!

01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:12.632
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.592
What the fuck is that?

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.115
I've taken Ivan's
shitty underpants.

01:12:17.158 --> 01:12:18.246
Ivan!

01:12:19.639 --> 01:12:20.901
Ivan!

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:22.860
Ivan, wait!

01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:24.514
Wait, please!

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:27.125
[rock music playing over stereo]

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:28.344
Wait!

01:12:29.214 --> 01:12:30.476
Fuck!

01:12:34.045 --> 01:12:35.263
[scoffs]

01:12:48.233 --> 01:12:51.105
You absolute fuckwit!

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:52.890
What are we
supposed to do now, huh?

01:12:52.933 --> 01:12:54.935
Adam, I'm so sorry,
mate, honestly.

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:57.198
I mean,
what's your suggestion, man?

01:12:57.242 --> 01:12:58.678
Maybe we
should just give Giorgio

01:12:58.722 --> 01:13:00.332
Ivan's bag
of shitty underpants.

01:13:01.246 --> 01:13:02.203
I don't think he's gonna want

01:13:02.247 --> 01:13:03.944
Ivan's bag
of shitty underpants.

01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:06.773
Of course he's not gonna want

01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:09.036
Ivan's bag
of shitty underpants.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.342
Why would he want...

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:17.262
Adam, mate! Sorry!

01:13:22.528 --> 01:13:23.660
Adam!

01:13:23.703 --> 01:13:25.052
Adam, mate!

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:27.403
Adam!

01:13:28.926 --> 01:13:30.014
Adam, mate! Adam, mate!

01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:31.929
We can sort this out, come on!

01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:33.713
We always do,
we're the Inseparables!

01:13:33.757 --> 01:13:35.846
You think that's a good thing
for me, Bav?

01:13:35.889 --> 01:13:37.674
Us being the Inseparables,
do you think

01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.415
that, that is
a good thing for me?

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:43.244
- Well, isn't it?
- No, it's not. It's not.

01:13:43.288 --> 01:13:45.246
Being in the Inseparables
with you, it's like--

01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:47.901
It's like--
it's like a life sentence.

01:13:47.945 --> 01:13:49.294
And I'm not talking about
a life sentence

01:13:49.337 --> 01:13:51.339
in your average
maximum security prison.

01:13:51.383 --> 01:13:53.472
I'm talking about
a life sentence
in a-- in a-- in a--

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.126
in a Siberian gulag,

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.954
doing back-breaking labor,

01:13:56.997 --> 01:14:00.958
while being repeatedly
punched in the face
for no reason.

01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:03.351
- You should really
twist your arm--
- Ah-da-da-da-da!

01:14:03.395 --> 01:14:04.962
- You should twist
your arm when you--
- Shut the fuck up!

01:14:05.005 --> 01:14:06.354
Oh, my God!

01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:07.486
You have any idea
how draining it is

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:08.661
to be around you all the time?

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:09.836
And I'm not just talking about

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.056
the way you consistently fuck

01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.579
literally everything up.

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:14.711
I'm talking about the guilt.

01:14:14.754 --> 01:14:17.104
I can't do it anymore.

01:14:17.148 --> 01:14:18.715
I can't just be
worried all the time

01:14:18.758 --> 01:14:20.412
that you're gonna kill yourself.

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:23.023
Kill myself? Why the hell

01:14:23.067 --> 01:14:24.242
would I want to kill myself?

01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:27.811
You said that you
wanted to kill yourself.

01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:29.334
- Did I?
- Yeah.

01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:30.509
Yeah, you said
that if you were gone

01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.293
when I were to get back
from my honeymoon,

01:14:32.337 --> 01:14:33.730
not to be sad.

01:14:35.993 --> 01:14:38.169
Oh, no, no, 'cause I was
thinking of taking a trip.

01:14:38.212 --> 01:14:40.084
- A trip?
- Yeah, I was gonna see my uncle

01:14:40.127 --> 01:14:42.652
- in India for a few months.
- Then... You...

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:44.480
Hold a minute,
is the only reason

01:14:44.523 --> 01:14:45.742
that you brought me
on your honeymoon

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:47.483
is because you thought
I might kill myself?

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:50.224
Hello? Yes!

01:14:50.268 --> 01:14:51.530
Of course, it is!

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.097
Why would I invite you
on my honeymoon?!

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.099
Because I'm your best mate!
I thought we'd have a laugh.

01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:57.144
- Oh, my God, dude--
- Okay, hold on a minute,

01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:58.276
so now are you pissed off

01:14:58.319 --> 01:14:59.756
because I'm not
gonna kill myself?

01:14:59.799 --> 01:15:00.974
That's fucked up, Adam!

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.586
I'll tell you
what's fucked up, Bav, this.

01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:05.326
Us!

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:06.545
Well, you know what, mate,
I've been wanting

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.373
to say something to you,
as well, you know?

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:11.071
- Since when you went to America
you fucking changed.
- Oh.

01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:12.812
And I'm not talking about
your stupid accent either.

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:14.422
I don't have a stupid accent.

01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:16.860
Yeah, you do!
You can't even say aluminium!

01:15:16.903 --> 01:15:18.339
- Yeah, I can.
- Say it then!

01:15:18.383 --> 01:15:20.080
Aluminum...
Aluminuminium.

01:15:20.124 --> 01:15:21.125
Sad...

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:24.563
You can't even say aluminium.

01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:28.567
For the last time, I did not
want to move to America!

01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:30.221
Why did you go?
Why did you go to America?

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:31.483
Why did you leave me then?

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.006
- That wasn't my choice!
- You left me!

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.704
- You were my only mate!
- My parents decided it for me!

01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:36.793
- I didn't have anyone!
- It wasn't my choice.

01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:41.101
They fucking left,
I had go with them, I was a kid!

01:15:41.145 --> 01:15:43.016
And I can't be made to feel
like I have to pay for it

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.452
for the rest of my life!

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:45.976
God!

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:50.415
We used to be good friends,
alright.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:52.243
But maybe it's best
that we accept

01:15:52.286 --> 01:15:53.549
that we're different people now,

01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:54.854
and we go our separate ways

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:56.508
and you leave me the fuck alone.

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:03.297
What'd I just say?
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:12.829
Don't look back at me, go!

01:16:21.098 --> 01:16:22.099
Fuck.

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.014
[dramatic music playing]

01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:21.898
Maybe I should
just kill myself.

01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:24.291
- Please, don't say that.
- No, I mean, come on.

01:17:24.335 --> 01:17:26.598
I've got no life,
I've got no girlfriend.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.253
I'm just a massive idiot.

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:34.171
You're not that massive.

01:17:36.129 --> 01:17:37.565
It's just the Christmas weight.

01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:42.396
I don't even know why I came
on your honeymoon, honestly.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.702
I think the only reason I did

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.661
because I thought this is
the last chance

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.401
I get to spend
some real time with you.

01:17:47.445 --> 01:17:48.881
Why would this be
our last chance?

01:17:48.925 --> 01:17:51.188
Adam, bro,
you know what's like.

01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:53.233
You and Sarah, you're probably
gonna move away together,

01:17:53.277 --> 01:17:55.801
you're gonna have
loads and loads
of amazing babies,

01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:58.325
I'll start seeing you
less and less and less...

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.027
Life just changes.

01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:07.073
But you'll always be
important to me.

01:18:07.857 --> 01:18:08.814
Thanks, man.

01:18:08.858 --> 01:18:10.207
Right now though
I do need to go

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.382
and try and rescue Sarah.

01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:13.863
Well, I'm coming with you,
obviously.

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:15.647
We're the Inseparables.

01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:23.046
[rock music playing]

01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:29.792
[Giorgio] You look beautiful.

01:18:33.621 --> 01:18:35.580
To be clear,
I'm only wearing this dress

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:38.714
because my other clothes
were starting to stink.

01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:41.281
And because it's
a fucking amazing dress.

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:58.124
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:00.257
- You don't have to do this.
- Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.519
- Ninja mode.
- Ninja mode?

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:03.347
- Come on, come, come...
- What's Ninja mode?

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:04.696
No. No Ninja mode.

01:19:07.133 --> 01:19:10.267
Sarah, I'm...
I need to be honest with you.

01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:14.750
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

01:19:14.793 --> 01:19:15.794
[chokes]

01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:19.145
I've fallen under your spell.

01:19:20.538 --> 01:19:22.192
And I think you
deserve something

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:23.846
very special from life.

01:19:26.979 --> 01:19:28.720
Shh, shh, shh.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:29.721
Shh.

01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:32.506
[mutters]

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.291
Okay, great. Okay, let's go.

01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:36.423
Wait, wait, wait.
Before we do this...

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:39.165
- Yeah?
- I've got a confession to make.

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:40.776
- What?
- I didn't really snog

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.560
the three girls
at the Lake District.

01:19:42.603 --> 01:19:44.954
Yeah, dude, I know,
I know that.

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:47.347
I only snogged two of them.
But they were twins.

01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:51.787
Okay, it was just one.
But she was a Swedish model.

01:19:53.745 --> 01:19:55.399
Alright, I didn't snog
any girls, alright.

01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:58.054
I didn't snog any girls.
Do you think any less of me?

01:19:58.097 --> 01:19:59.664
No, Bav, I don't think
any less of you.

01:19:59.707 --> 01:20:01.840
[classical music playing]

01:20:09.761 --> 01:20:13.896
Sarah, you make me
want to be a better man.

01:20:23.993 --> 01:20:25.472
Whoa...

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:28.084
Are you nuts?

01:20:29.563 --> 01:20:31.827
You-you really think
I would fall for you

01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:33.393
just because you are
taking me to an art gallery

01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:34.830
and giving me
a nice dress to wear?

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:38.050
Jesus Christ, I'm married!

01:20:38.094 --> 01:20:40.096
To an amazing guy!

01:20:40.139 --> 01:20:43.099
And you are a psychopath!

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.932
Did you just fart?

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:51.890
Yeah, I'm scared.
Would you--? Fuck!

[Rico] What are you doing?

01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:01.769
Hi.

01:21:01.813 --> 01:21:03.032
[Luigi] Giorgio?

[door opens]

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:11.388
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:13.042
[Adam] What is that?

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.522
[Rico speaking Italian]

01:21:15.566 --> 01:21:16.654
How did you get here?

01:21:17.524 --> 01:21:19.048
Where's Sarah?

01:21:19.091 --> 01:21:20.440
Where's the money?

01:21:22.616 --> 01:21:25.228
Kind of a...
sort of lost it.

01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:27.230
Lost it?

01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:29.493
Well, it's a shame,

01:21:29.536 --> 01:21:30.581
because if you lost the money,

01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:31.625
then we'll have to kill you.

01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:34.846
- [guns cock]
- Wait, wait!

01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:37.631
If you're gonna kill him,

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:39.155
then you'll have to kill me,
too.

01:21:39.198 --> 01:21:40.896
Well, that's already
what they were gonna do.

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:42.027
They were gonna kill you both.

01:21:42.071 --> 01:21:43.507
Oh, sorry.

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:44.638
Oh, fuck.

01:21:44.682 --> 01:21:45.857

Please, please, please,
just wait.

01:21:49.078 --> 01:21:51.123
Tell Sarah...

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:53.473
Please, just tell Sarah
not to grieve for me.

01:21:53.517 --> 01:21:54.561
Okay?

01:21:55.693 --> 01:21:57.216
Okay?

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.175
Tell Sarah not to grieve for me.

01:21:59.218 --> 01:22:02.526
I mean, a little bit,
obviously, but not too much.

01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:07.400
And, um... and tell her
to find someone else.

01:22:08.619 --> 01:22:09.837
But tell her to make sure

01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:11.361
that it's someone
who truly deserves her.

01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:13.015
You know, maybe someone
who can understand her passions

01:22:13.058 --> 01:22:14.625
in a way that I never could,

01:22:14.668 --> 01:22:16.757
however hard
I thought I tried.

01:22:16.801 --> 01:22:21.023
And, um... yeah,
just tell her to make sure

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:24.113
that it's someone who will
support her dreams. Okay?

01:22:24.156 --> 01:22:28.378
And, uh... tell her
to have kids if she can.

01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:30.510
God, she'd just be
the best Mom ever.

01:22:31.555 --> 01:22:32.469
And tell her that--

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:33.818
Jesus fucking Christ,

01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:36.429
do you want me
to get a fucking pad and pen?

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:38.257
How am I supposed to
remember all this?

01:22:38.301 --> 01:22:40.433
Maybe I could remember
the first part about the dreams,

01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:41.913
and Rico could remember
the second--

[grunts]

01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:46.265

01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:50.530

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:55.057

Okay. Now I have to go,

01:22:57.015 --> 01:22:58.712

- This is it. This is it, man.

- What are you...?

Well, I don't know, now.
You can't decide with--

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:25.087
You can't just
pee on the spot.

01:25:38.263 --> 01:25:39.569
Kick him in the balls!

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:46.228
- No, no, no--
- Giorgio, don't!

01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:47.577
[panting]

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.970
Sarah, move away.

01:25:50.014 --> 01:25:51.842
Move away!

01:25:51.885 --> 01:25:54.627
Listen, since the time
I've spent here,

01:25:54.671 --> 01:25:56.368
I've seen a good man in you.

01:25:56.412 --> 01:25:58.109
I've seen an artist

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:00.372
who just happens to sell drugs
and kill people.

01:26:00.416 --> 01:26:03.506
But, Giorgio,
if any of the feelings

01:26:03.549 --> 01:26:05.290
you said you had for me
are real...

01:26:06.596 --> 01:26:08.380
please, let us go.

01:26:10.469 --> 01:26:12.906
[chuckles]

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:14.212
Let you go?

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:16.127
[laughing]

01:26:17.476 --> 01:26:19.913
And what am I left with?

01:26:19.957 --> 01:26:23.265
No money, no drugs,
more broken art.

01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:24.962
Not even any a dead body.

01:26:25.005 --> 01:26:27.051
What do you think
my father's going to say?!

01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:32.012
Well, maybe this is the day
that you stand up
to your father.

01:26:43.546 --> 01:26:45.069
[soft chuckle]

01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:51.641
Ah...

01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:54.818
[speaking Italian]

01:26:55.819 --> 01:26:57.212
Just, go.

01:26:58.865 --> 01:27:00.606
[speaking Italian]

01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.521
Go, before I change my mind.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.655
Go!

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:10.094
[Adam] Bav! Bav!

01:27:10.137 --> 01:27:11.574
- [knocking on door]
- [Adam] Bav, open the door!

01:27:11.617 --> 01:27:14.098
- Who is it?
- It's me... what? It's Adam!

01:27:14.141 --> 01:27:15.708
How do I know it's not Giorgio
doing an accent?

01:27:15.752 --> 01:27:17.536
- Bro, open the fucking door!
- Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry!

01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:20.322
Dude, Giorgio is letting us go.

01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:21.627
I don't know, I don't know.

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:27.024
[Adam muttering]

01:27:28.895 --> 01:27:30.245
Thank you, thank you.

01:27:31.507 --> 01:27:33.117
Sorry.
Thank you, thank you.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.988
[dramatic music playing]

01:28:00.927 --> 01:28:03.190
Hey, you okay?

01:28:03.234 --> 01:28:04.366
- I am.
- Yeah?

01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:06.759
Oh, God, I love you so much.

01:28:06.803 --> 01:28:08.152
I love you so much.

01:28:10.241 --> 01:28:12.156
- I was so worried about you.
- I was so worried about you,
too.

01:28:18.205 --> 01:28:20.120
- Bav.
- Yeah?

01:28:22.253 --> 01:28:24.124
What you just did in there

01:28:24.168 --> 01:28:26.866
was the bravest thing
I've ever seen anyone do.

01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:29.608
Yeah. I don't know
what came over me, honestly.

01:28:29.652 --> 01:28:31.393
I think I went
temporarily insane.

01:28:31.436 --> 01:28:32.829
Come here.

01:28:32.872 --> 01:28:34.613
- Get over here.
- Come here.

01:28:46.364 --> 01:28:48.018
Bav?

01:28:48.061 --> 01:28:50.716
- Yeah?
- Have you pissed yourself?

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.588
What makes you say that?

01:28:52.631 --> 01:28:55.068
'Cause I can feel something
wet on my leg,

01:28:55.112 --> 01:28:57.419
and I can smell piss.

01:28:57.462 --> 01:29:00.160
Oh, yeah-- I think I have--
I think I have pissed myself.

01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:02.075
I mean, to be fair,
I did just nearly die.

01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:04.251
I guess that's fair enough.

01:29:06.602 --> 01:29:07.690
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:29:11.737 --> 01:29:13.130
- [sniffs]
- It is piss.

01:29:13.173 --> 01:29:14.610
- It's piss.
- You're smelling it?

01:29:14.653 --> 01:29:16.351
Yeah, no,
I don't need to smell--

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:17.482
I smelled it in the hug...

01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:18.788
- Oh, God!
- Sorry, sorry.

01:29:18.831 --> 01:29:20.572
- It's piss, sorry.
- It's disgusting,

01:29:20.616 --> 01:29:22.139
- Again, no need to smell it.
- Sorry.

01:29:22.182 --> 01:29:23.532
- Alright, can we?
- Yeah.

01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:24.489
- Yeah?
- Let's go.

01:29:24.533 --> 01:29:25.708
Maybe get a taxi.

01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:27.274
- Nice dress, by the way!
- Thanks!

01:29:27.318 --> 01:29:29.494
[bell tolling]

01:29:36.545 --> 01:29:37.763
Well...

01:29:40.853 --> 01:29:42.202
[both chuckle]

01:29:42.246 --> 01:29:43.465
This is it.

01:29:43.508 --> 01:29:45.249
Oh, I forgot to give you
your T-shirt.

01:29:45.292 --> 01:29:48.034
- Oh, yeah, cool.
- [chuckles]

01:29:48.078 --> 01:29:50.080
You...
you don't have to put it on.

01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:51.690
- No, no, I want to.
- You sure?

01:29:51.734 --> 01:29:53.431
- Oh, yeah, come on.
- Aww.

01:29:55.128 --> 01:29:56.782
It was
"Buy one, get one free".

01:29:59.132 --> 01:30:01.004
Hey. [chuckles]

01:30:01.047 --> 01:30:02.745
- Twins!
- Twins!

01:30:02.788 --> 01:30:04.007
[chuckles]

01:30:06.444 --> 01:30:08.838
So, uh, where are you gonna go?

01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:10.230
I don't know, man.

01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:12.058
See where the wind takes me,
you know.

01:30:12.102 --> 01:30:14.191
Might check out a few sites,
but...

01:30:14.234 --> 01:30:16.454
I'll give you guys some time
on your own, you know.

01:30:16.498 --> 01:30:19.065
Some time for yourselves,
you know.

01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:20.632
- Alright.
- Yeah.

01:30:20.676 --> 01:30:24.375
Well, uh...
take care of yourself.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:26.508
Take care of yourself,
too, mate!

01:30:29.685 --> 01:30:30.990
Oh. [chuckles]

01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:35.299
We'll always be
the Inseparables.

01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:46.919
It's alright.

01:30:46.963 --> 01:30:49.008
Oh, and Sarah...

01:30:49.052 --> 01:30:50.749
don't miss me too much
on your honeymoon.

01:30:50.793 --> 01:30:53.012
[chuckles]
I'll try not to, Bav.

01:31:00.193 --> 01:31:03.806
Well, it hasn't been
the honeymoon I had
planned in my head,

01:31:03.849 --> 01:31:06.722
but it's definitely
been memorable.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.341
Do you mind taking
the, um, shirt off?

01:31:17.384 --> 01:31:20.475
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- [chuckles]

01:31:21.519 --> 01:31:22.477
Better?

01:31:23.608 --> 01:31:25.741
[upbeat music playing]

01:31:37.666 --> 01:31:39.711
- [gasps]
- Oh!

01:31:39.755 --> 01:31:41.496
Oh, my God! I'm so--
Oh, my God!

01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:43.759
I'm sorry! Oh, sorry.

01:31:43.802 --> 01:31:45.630
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.

01:31:45.674 --> 01:31:46.762
Your-your face!

01:31:46.805 --> 01:31:48.851
It's-it's so familiar...

01:31:48.894 --> 01:31:51.201
Hold on a minute,
are you a porn star?

01:31:51.897 --> 01:31:53.159
Yes.

01:31:53.203 --> 01:31:54.552
Really?

01:31:54.596 --> 01:31:55.945
[speaking Italian]

01:31:55.988 --> 01:31:58.121
[laughs] Joking.

01:31:58.164 --> 01:32:00.123
[speaking Italian]

01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:03.256
- Uh... fake!
- No, it's not fake,
this is 20 euro!

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.782
- [both laughing]
- Funny!

01:32:06.825 --> 01:32:09.088
- I'm, Bav, nice to meet you.
- Anna.

01:32:09.132 --> 01:32:10.437
Are you walking this way?

01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:12.004
- Um...
- Yeah.

01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:15.181
We walk together, maybe?

01:32:15.225 --> 01:32:17.488
Okay.

01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:21.231
- Yeah? Okay.
- [speaking Italian]

01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:24.930
Do you like karate?
Karate?

01:32:24.974 --> 01:32:26.584
[karate noises]

01:32:26.628 --> 01:32:28.455
Oh, you do the twist, as well!

01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:29.456
Same!

01:32:30.632 --> 01:32:32.721
[upbeat music playing]

01:33:00.313 --> 01:33:02.402
[engine shuts off]

01:33:02.446 --> 01:33:04.230
[sighs]

01:33:05.362 --> 01:33:07.277
[birds chirping]

01:33:23.641 --> 01:33:25.469
[upbeat music playing]

01:36:25.649 --> 01:36:28.391
- [Bav] My dream girl?
- [Adam] Yeah, who's that?

01:36:28.434 --> 01:36:30.436
Well, I don't got one,
but if I had a dream girl

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.874
it'd be someone
who understands me, you know,

01:36:32.917 --> 01:36:35.180
someone... we'd be like a team,

01:36:35.224 --> 01:36:37.574
Someone who supports me,
who loves me.

01:36:37.617 --> 01:36:39.750
Who loves me for me, you know?

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:43.667
Someone, like, you know,
maybe dark hair, you know.

01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.538
Someone who...

01:36:45.582 --> 01:36:47.845
I've been in love with
for a long time.

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.500
Will you marry me?

01:36:50.543 --> 01:36:53.242
- Oh, are you joking?
- Yeah, no, this is real.

01:36:56.898 --> 01:36:58.813
[all cheering]

01:37:05.645 --> 01:37:06.821
Take that one off.

01:37:09.258 --> 01:37:10.215
I'm shaking.

01:37:12.348 --> 01:37:14.480
Oh, my God, what the fuck?

01:37:14.524 --> 01:37:16.918
Oh, my God, are you joking?

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.446
[cheering]

01:37:26.666 --> 01:37:28.320
Alright, back to work!

01:37:28.364 --> 01:37:29.974
[laughs]
