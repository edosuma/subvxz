Don't do anything, guys.
Just relax, all right?

15:18.661 --> 15:23.630
Well, I'm just fuzzy as to
why you think he needs a lawyer.

15:23.666 --> 15:27.834
I mean, Craig, the way you run
your office is beyond reproach.

15:27.836 --> 15:29.469
Yeah. Yeah. Beyond reproach.

15:29.505 --> 15:30.887
Yeah. I'm a stickler, you know, for...

15:30.923 --> 15:32.889
He is. He's a stickler with the money.

15:32.925 --> 15:34.508
- He's definitely a stickler.
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:34.510 --> 15:36.760
I mean, he's certainly
not guilty of some...

15:36.812 --> 15:39.980
Is certainly not. He's innocent
of any wrongdoing.

15:40.015 --> 15:41.898
That's abundantly clear to me.

15:41.934 --> 15:45.519
And frankly, I don't go looking
for guilty people to represent.

15:45.521 --> 15:48.105
I mean [chuckling] who needs
that aggravation, right?

15:48.157 --> 15:49.523
Right. [Laughter]

15:49.525 --> 15:52.743
Look, all I know
is what I read in the paper.

15:52.778 --> 15:56.446
And typically, when money goes missing

15:56.498 --> 15:58.081
from the county treasury...
And the number here is,

15:58.117 --> 15:59.282
uh, $1.6 million...

15:59.334 --> 16:00.534
Well, that's an accounting...

16:00.536 --> 16:01.785
It's an accounting discrepancy.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.036
It's a discrepancy, absolutely.

16:03.038 --> 16:06.256
But typically, when that happens,

16:06.291 --> 16:08.458
the police look at the treasurer.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.845
And since that person is, uh... [chuckles]

16:11.880 --> 16:15.098
I just think a little
proactivity may be in order.

16:15.134 --> 16:17.267
Well...

16:17.302 --> 16:19.386
You know, I just think I'd
look guilty if I hired a lawyer.

16:19.388 --> 16:21.288
- Yeah.
- No.

16:21.323 --> 16:24.891
Actually, it's getting arrested
that makes people look guilty,

16:24.893 --> 16:26.393
even the innocent ones,

16:26.395 --> 16:28.228
and innocent people get arrested every day.

16:28.230 --> 16:31.231

like he's their best friend.

"help me clear this thing up.

guilty people need lawyers."

Oh.

24:13.602 --> 24:17.020
Brenda, looking good. Nice do.

24:17.072 --> 24:19.022
Uh, where's Lord Vader?

24:19.074 --> 24:20.857
Uh, he's not quite ready for you yet.

24:20.909 --> 24:22.692
South conference room.

24:22.744 --> 24:24.110
How about you wait out here?

24:24.112 --> 24:26.946
How about I don't? [Scoffs]

24:26.948 --> 24:29.782
- Oh, Sir Francis.
- James.

24:29.784 --> 24:31.417
Well-groomed, as always.

24:31.453 --> 24:33.620
- Okay.
- All right.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.175
[Clears throat]

24:39.210 --> 24:42.045
Keith, Karen, yes. [Claps hands]

24:43.965 --> 24:47.934
[Inhales deeply]

24:47.969 --> 24:53.356
You have meddled with the primal
forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin,

24:53.391 --> 24:56.192
and I won't have it!

24:56.227 --> 24:57.610
Brenda: Do you want me to call security?

24:57.646 --> 24:59.228
It's okay, Brenda, we got it.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.647
[Button clicks]

25:00.649 --> 25:03.066
Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate. Hey, Aaron.

25:03.118 --> 25:05.034
What can we do for you, Jimmy?

25:05.070 --> 25:07.870
I'm sorry. It's... It's this table.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.740
Something just comes over me.

25:16.498 --> 25:19.499
You can tell me what this, uh, $26,000

25:19.501 --> 25:21.918
is supposed to be for.

25:21.970 --> 25:24.837
That's money for Chuck.
Isn't that what you wanted?

25:24.839 --> 25:28.057
A measly 26 grand? [Scoffs]

25:28.093 --> 25:30.059
Jesus, you're like Peter
Minuit with the Indians.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.061
Throw in some beads and shells
while you're at it.

25:32.097 --> 25:33.731
It's just a start. There'll be more...

25:33.797 --> 25:35.380
Unless you're gonna just tear them all up.

25:35.382 --> 25:38.383
And why was it made out to me...
Why not Chuck?

25:38.385 --> 25:39.851
Can he make his way to the bank?

25:39.886 --> 25:42.687
[Inhales sharply]

25:43.085 --> 25:44.667
I just assumed it was best

25:44.719 --> 25:46.302
to have the money go through you.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.721
We can do it any way you want.

25:48.757 --> 25:51.141
This isn't going away, Howard.

25:51.176 --> 25:54.144
What Chuck did for this firm...
And damn near single-handedly...

25:54.179 --> 25:57.347
1/3 of this place belongs to him.

25:57.399 --> 25:59.766
Yeah. What do you got... 12 chairs here?

25:59.768 --> 26:02.185
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.

26:02.237 --> 26:04.821
You got five of these light thingumajigs?

26:04.856 --> 26:09.025
Uh, mm, 1 2/3 are Chuck's.

26:09.077 --> 26:12.028
Yeah. Six... How many
danishes... Six danishes?

26:12.080 --> 26:13.863
You can have all the Danish
you want, Jimmy. No, no.

26:13.915 --> 26:16.282
They're Chuck's danishes,
and Chuck isn't greedy,

26:16.284 --> 26:18.034
so h-he'll just take two...

26:18.086 --> 26:21.871
Plus $17 million... In that ballpark.

26:21.923 --> 26:23.506
I mean, we'll know

26:23.542 --> 26:25.925
once we get the accountants
poking around here.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.761
Until then, no more penny-ante checks

26:28.797 --> 26:30.763
designed to make it look like
Chuck still works here.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.966
He doesn't. He never will again.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.969
It's time to do right by him
and cash him out.

26:35.971 --> 26:39.272
So, these are Chuck's own wishes
that you're conveying?

26:39.307 --> 26:41.774
- This is what's best for him.
- Mm.

26:41.810 --> 26:44.060
So he personally told you
that it's his wish

26:44.112 --> 26:45.612
to withdraw from the firm?

26:45.647 --> 26:47.063
[Scoffs]

26:49.484 --> 26:50.950
See, that would surprise me.

26:50.986 --> 26:52.702
It's been nearly a year
since he's set foot in here.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.579
I'm just doing what's in his

26:54.604 --> 26:56.289
- best interests.
- So am I.

26:56.324 --> 26:59.909
And I, for one, believe
he's gonna lick this thing.

26:59.961 --> 27:02.328
Until then, his office
is just as he left it.

27:02.330 --> 27:03.963
His secretary's still on payroll.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.382
If Chuck can call this
an extended sabbatical,

27:06.418 --> 27:08.334
then so can we...
He's that important to us.

27:08.336 --> 27:12.255
You know what?
Let's let a jury figure it out.

27:12.307 --> 27:15.808
[Sighs] Yeah, they're
gonna love you, Howard.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.094
You're so down-to-earth and relatable.

27:19.848 --> 27:24.684
And you... Will... Atone!

27:27.105 --> 27:29.689
It's Ned Beatty, from "Network."

27:29.691 --> 27:33.776
For Christ's sakes, guys.

Jimmy.

27:43.505 --> 27:46.456
I almost forgot... This month's filings.

27:46.508 --> 27:48.675
You could save me the postage.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.510
W... Weren't you listening in there?

27:50.545 --> 27:52.512
Chuck doesn't work here anymore.

27:52.547 --> 27:54.681
You think I'm gonna help you
establish a paper trail?

27:54.716 --> 27:55.965
- Now, Jimmy...
- No, stop trying

27:55.990 --> 27:57.324
to pawn that shit off on him.

27:57.352 --> 27:59.519
Jimmy.

27:59.554 --> 28:02.722
You know, Jimmy, sometimes,
in our line of work,

28:02.724 --> 28:07.560
you can get so... Caught
up in the idea of winning

28:07.562 --> 28:10.029
that you forget to listen to your heart.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.818
Give Chuck my love, would you?

28:17.906 --> 28:20.290
- [Scoffs]
- Oh, there you are.

28:20.325 --> 28:23.293
- Betsy, Craig.

- Mm-hmm.
- "University of Helsinki"?

32:37.974 --> 32:40.357
Yeah, you're gonna have to
get that translated.

32:40.393 --> 32:43.194
- Into Swedish?
- Finnish.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.196
Finnish, uh, translating into...

[Sighs]

32:46.866 --> 32:50.568
I'm sure there's someone at UNM
who can do that.

a legal practice, right?

Vogelson's been working on the effects

- [Breathes deeply]
- Yeah, I knew you

33:03.027 --> 33:04.799
missed it, so I figured, "what the heck?"

33:04.834 --> 33:07.001
Thank you. I know it's expensive.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.836
Here. [Clears throat]

33:08.888 --> 33:10.387
That's not... It's all right.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.223
- I don't expect you to go out of pocket.
- I...

33:12.258 --> 33:14.425
Go ahead... Reimburse yourself.

[Clicks tongue]

read that for a second?

33:22.902 --> 33:24.518
Can we talk?

33:27.273 --> 33:28.906
Are you all right?

33:28.941 --> 33:30.524
You look peaked.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.243
I'm fine. Please, just sit.

33:32.278 --> 33:36.247
You're not in trouble.

33:36.282 --> 33:41.669
Um... You got to cash out.

33:41.704 --> 33:43.087
You got to.

33:43.122 --> 33:46.090
Again? Really? There's no other way.

I know that you don't want to
hear it, but you've got to.

You know I'm going to beat this.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.931
You know I'm going to get better.

33:53.966 --> 33:56.767
- Yeah, sure.
- [Chuckling] Well, then,

33:56.802 --> 33:58.769
there's nothing more to talk about.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.221
I will beat this.

Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci.

- Meaning?
- That's not...

34:06.979 --> 34:07.961
- Meaning?
- That's the one about

34:07.986 --> 34:09.146
false principles, but it's not...

34:09.148 --> 34:11.148
You proceed from false principles.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.983
Your argument is built on quicksand.

34:12.985 --> 34:15.870
- Therefore, it collapses.
- Yeah, yeah. You're not listening.

34:15.905 --> 34:17.871
[Sighs] Fine.

34:17.907 --> 34:20.491
Let's take this to its logical conclusion.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.126
[Sighs]

34:22.161 --> 34:23.960
In order to pay out my share,

34:23.996 --> 34:26.914
suppose my partners are forced
to liquidate the firm.

34:26.966 --> 34:28.882
- Then what?
- That's their problem.

34:28.918 --> 34:30.751
My clients are out in the cold.

34:30.803 --> 34:32.920
My cases are scattered to the winds.

34:32.972 --> 34:35.556
126 people lose their jobs.

34:35.591 --> 34:39.260
What happens to your cronies
in the mailroom, the assistants,

34:39.312 --> 34:40.678
the paralegals, the janitorial staff?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.346
All of them, out on the street.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.481
Your friend Kim... a promising
career... over and done with.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.483
Hamlin owes you everything.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.185
You built that place single-handedly

34:48.187 --> 34:50.821
while he was out at four hills
working on his bunker shot.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.440
Let's not exaggerate. I helped. You helped.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.858
- [Scoffs]
- [Scoffs]

34:54.860 --> 34:56.610
All the more reason not to tear it down

34:56.661 --> 34:58.078
just for a little bit of cash.

34:58.114 --> 35:01.699
Look... Chuck, I'm going under, okay?

35:01.701 --> 35:05.336
For the third time with these
bull-crap contract counsel...

35:05.371 --> 35:07.388
- "Bull crap"?
- Bull-crap, pissant P.D.

35:07.413 --> 35:08.980
Cases at 700 bucks a shot.

35:09.008 --> 35:12.593
Public-defender work is some of the
best experience there is.

35:12.628 --> 35:16.013
I just had a case, Chuck,
with three clients...

35:16.048 --> 35:18.432
Uh, arraignments, voir dire, jury trial...

35:18.467 --> 35:19.850
The whole nine yards.

35:19.885 --> 35:22.469
You know what I took home? 700 bucks.

35:22.521 --> 35:25.472
Yeah, I might as well head down
to skid row and sell plasma.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.808
You're representing people
who have nowhere else to turn.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.643
The money is beside the point.

35:29.695 --> 35:32.646
Money is not <i> beside</i> the point...
Money <i>is</i> the point.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.065
I keep telling you... Have patience.

35:35.067 --> 35:36.317
There are no shortcuts.

35:36.369 --> 35:37.735
Do good work, and the clients will come.

35:37.737 --> 35:39.737
The clients will come. Yeah, I know.

35:39.739 --> 35:41.739
Okay.

35:41.741 --> 35:47.211
Hand to God, I wasn't gonna
say this, but you are broke.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.830
I can't carry both of us.

35:49.882 --> 35:53.834
I've been trying like hell, but I can't.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.837
[Chuckling] Well, you're saying what?

35:56.889 --> 35:58.472
You think you have to provide for me?

35:58.507 --> 36:00.674
I never asked you that.
You didn't have to ask, okay?

36:00.726 --> 36:03.093
I've been doing my damnedest,

36:03.095 --> 36:04.928
but the day of reckoning is here.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.348
Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be
out on the street

36:07.400 --> 36:11.769
with all the electromagnetism in
the world raining down on you.

36:11.771 --> 36:13.771
Now, please, please, picture that,

36:13.773 --> 36:16.106
then tell me
that money is beside the point.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.075
This is what has you all worked up?

36:18.110 --> 36:19.493
Yeah!

36:19.528 --> 36:23.113
Jimmy... There's nothing to worry about.

36:23.115 --> 36:26.116
- Here.
- What is this?

36:26.118 --> 36:28.335
A stipend...
There's gonna be one every week.

36:28.371 --> 36:31.538
$857 from Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?

36:31.590 --> 36:33.874
I'm gonna pay them back... Every penny.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.510
I didn't want to take anything,
but Howard was very insistent.

36:36.545 --> 36:38.679
And I'm gonna pay <i>you</i> back, too.

36:38.714 --> 36:40.681
Wait, Hamlin was here?

36:40.716 --> 36:43.100
It's not like I'm a recluse.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.102
What? He put his cellphone in the mailbox?

36:45.137 --> 36:46.520
He understands the situation.

36:46.555 --> 36:48.522
- He grounded himself?
- Of course.

36:48.557 --> 36:51.141
And the two of you agreed
that since, as everybody knows,

36:51.143 --> 36:52.976
you're going back to work any day now,

36:52.978 --> 36:55.479
that the firm should help you
make ends meet.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.781
That's correct, minus the sarcasm.

36:57.817 --> 36:59.450
Hamlin's making you a chump!

36:59.485 --> 37:01.869
I'm going to get better!

37:01.904 --> 37:03.203
I'm gonna go back to work,

37:03.239 --> 37:06.907
and I'm picking up where I left off!

37:06.959 --> 37:08.542
[Sighs]

37:08.577 --> 37:10.744
[Chuckles, sighs]

37:10.796 --> 37:12.796
[Clock ticking]

37:28.681 --> 37:31.515
Sorry.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.351
Sorry, Chuck.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.939
[Inhales deeply]

37:38.991 --> 37:42.576
I understand that you're
trying to look out for me,

37:42.611 --> 37:45.079
but you're missing the bigger picture.

37:45.114 --> 37:47.698
I got it.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.501
[Sighs] Speaking of which...

37:50.536 --> 37:54.338
Howard brought this.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.256
He's concerned.

37:56.292 --> 37:57.591
What?

37:57.626 --> 37:59.460
You have to admit...
It could be confusing...

37:59.512 --> 38:01.095
Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?

38:01.130 --> 38:03.297
- James M. Mcgill?
- That's my name.

38:03.349 --> 38:06.383
- I was born with it. I...
- Still...

38:09.188 --> 38:12.973
How about Vanguard law?

38:13.025 --> 38:15.776
Or gi... Gibraltar legal... Wait, wait.

38:15.811 --> 38:19.980
So I'm not supposed to use
my name o... On Hamlin's say-so?

38:20.032 --> 38:22.399
What's he gonna do... Sue me?

38:22.401 --> 38:25.068
Nobody wants to create
an adversarial situation.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.287
I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost

38:27.323 --> 38:29.289
of new matchbooks and so on.

38:29.325 --> 38:30.657
[Sighs]

38:30.709 --> 38:34.661
It's simply a matter
of professional courtesy.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.498
[Ticking continues]

38:37.550 --> 38:40.167
Chuck, whose side are you on?

38:40.219 --> 38:44.171
There are no sides.

38:44.223 --> 38:48.809
But, Jimmy... [sighs]

38:48.844 --> 38:51.929
Wouldn't you rather
build your own identity?

38:51.931 --> 38:55.182
Why ride on someone else's coattails?

39:00.606 --> 39:02.823
[Sighing]

39:02.858 --> 39:04.858
[Insects chirping]

39:08.113 --> 39:10.697
You want to dance, Howard?

39:10.749 --> 39:15.202
[Chuckles] Let's dance.

39:25.810 --> 39:27.810
Go!

39:30.120 --> 39:32.287
No, you can get closer
than that, you bitch.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.120
Come on.

39:34.155 --> 39:36.038
And here it comes.

39:36.074 --> 39:39.875
There you go. Better.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.495
- [Cheering in distance]
- How was that?

39:42.497 --> 39:44.130
It's right on here. Take a look.

39:44.165 --> 39:45.965
Still, tighter is everything.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.967
Tighter? What? T... Tighter what?

39:48.002 --> 39:50.169
I don't know. Just stand... Tighter.

39:50.171 --> 39:52.471
You know what I mean? I
don't know what you mean.

39:52.507 --> 39:55.091
That sucked. We can call that
a stylistic choice, I guess,

39:55.143 --> 39:56.726
- if you want to...
- Hey, fellas.

39:56.761 --> 39:57.977
We got business.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.263
How did you find us?

40:01.316 --> 40:05.418
I know... Eerie, right.

40:05.453 --> 40:09.405
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on.
Give me 30 seconds.

40:09.440 --> 40:13.943
Could be the most profitable
30 seconds of your lives.

40:13.995 --> 40:17.196
[Indistinct conversations]

40:20.835 --> 40:26.205
Let me tell you about a young guy...

40:26.207 --> 40:29.425
Actually, he's about your age.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.044
He lived a long way from here

40:32.046 --> 40:36.682
in a town called Cicero, Illinois.

40:36.718 --> 40:40.302
And in Cicero, he was the man.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.304
I mean, when he strolled down the street,

40:42.357 --> 40:45.941
all the corner boys
would give him the high five.

40:45.977 --> 40:49.562
All the finest babes would smile at him

40:49.564 --> 40:53.399
and hope that he would smile back.

40:53.401 --> 40:57.403
They called him "slippin' Jimmy,"

40:57.405 --> 41:02.241
and everybody wanted to be his friend.

41:02.243 --> 41:04.460
"Slippin' Jimmy"?

41:04.495 --> 41:07.463
What the hell kind of name
is [chuckling] that?

41:07.498 --> 41:08.998
Well, I'll tell you, now...

41:09.050 --> 41:11.834
Winters in Cicero are murder. [Chuckles]

41:11.886 --> 41:14.470
You guys growing up
out here in the golden west...

41:14.505 --> 41:16.305
Y... You don't know, okay?

41:16.340 --> 41:20.159
I'm talking cold that'll freeze
the snot right in your nose.

41:20.194 --> 41:21.977
I'm talking wind
that'll cut through your jacket

41:22.013 --> 41:24.180
and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.600
In fact, most folks in Cicero
were scared of winter,

41:27.602 --> 41:30.436
but not Jimmy.

41:30.438 --> 41:32.354
Jimmy waited around all summer,

41:32.407 --> 41:34.774
and when September finally rolled around

41:34.776 --> 41:36.776
and he'd feel that first cold wind

41:36.778 --> 41:41.347
come sweeping off lake Michigan,
he knew <i> it</i> was coming.

41:41.382 --> 41:44.166
Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?

41:44.202 --> 41:48.587
Better... It was slip 'n fall season.

41:48.623 --> 41:50.423
Soon as it was cold enough,

41:50.458 --> 41:53.592
he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.

41:53.628 --> 41:56.429
State street was good.
Michigan Avenue was better.

41:56.464 --> 41:59.265
He'd pick his spot,
wait for it to get busy,

41:59.300 --> 42:02.184
then he'd walk out on the ice, and... Boom!

42:02.220 --> 42:04.220
He would biff it so hard,

42:04.272 --> 42:07.440
people would come running
from five blocks away.

42:07.475 --> 42:09.809
- Yeah, but did he collect?
- "Did he collect?"

42:09.811 --> 42:12.027
Slippin' Jimmy had it dialed in, all right?

42:12.063 --> 42:15.448
One good fall... He'd clear 6, 8 grand.

42:15.483 --> 42:16.866
That'd keep him in old Milwaukee

42:16.901 --> 42:18.984
and Maui Wowie right through labor day.

42:18.986 --> 42:20.619
8 grand?

42:20.655 --> 42:22.154
8 grand.

42:22.156 --> 42:24.790
Now, see, I look at you guys,
I see potential.

42:24.826 --> 42:26.208
The skateboard's a nice wrinkle...

42:26.244 --> 42:28.043
That makes it a year-round gig.

42:28.079 --> 42:32.298
And clearly, you know
how to take a header, right?

42:32.333 --> 42:34.500
But I got to ask you... Your best day ever,

42:34.502 --> 42:36.502
how much did you clear?

42:39.340 --> 42:41.307
$630. $630.

42:41.342 --> 42:44.727
[Scoffs] 630 bucks.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.428
Was that for one fall?

42:46.481 --> 42:49.648
Two. Two falls in one day. [Chuckles]

42:49.684 --> 42:51.650
Even at your age, that's got to hurt.

42:51.686 --> 42:53.486
True that.

42:53.521 --> 42:56.689
All right, well, I got a job for you.

42:56.691 --> 42:58.757
How's 2 grand sound?

42:58.793 --> 43:00.960
2 grand for one hit?

43:00.995 --> 43:03.162
One hit.

43:03.197 --> 43:06.265
Plus, you get to learn from the best.

43:06.300 --> 43:08.667
Nice boat.

43:08.703 --> 43:11.871
Yeah, discreet, like
a stripper pole in a mosque.

43:11.873 --> 43:14.290
Yeah, forget the boat. Look at the car.

43:14.342 --> 43:15.875
You know what that is?

43:15.877 --> 43:17.376
I don't know. A station wagon?

43:17.378 --> 43:21.113
It's a Mercury, a 1988 Mercury sable wagon.

43:21.149 --> 43:23.716
Remember it. Burn it
into your brains. You got it?

43:23.718 --> 43:26.218
It's a Mercury sable wagon, sure.

43:26.220 --> 43:28.521
Jimmy: Close your eyes. What color is it?

43:28.556 --> 43:30.139
- Brown.
- Brown.

43:30.191 --> 43:33.359
No, it's medium sandalwood.
Keep your eyes closed.

43:33.394 --> 43:35.194
How does the license plate start?

43:35.229 --> 43:36.362
- 4.
- 4.

43:36.397 --> 43:38.814
Give those gentlemen a gold star.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.033
Betsy Kettleman's her name.

43:41.068 --> 43:44.036
Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50,

43:44.071 --> 43:46.238
she comes through here
on her way to pick up her kids

43:46.240 --> 43:48.240
at Kit Carson Elementary.

43:48.242 --> 43:50.075
Now, you need a place
where she's gonna slow down...

43:50.077 --> 43:51.627
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

43:51.662 --> 43:54.480
All right. Well, there you go.
She slows down.

43:54.515 --> 43:58.467
She hangs a right.
You come shooting out of there.

43:58.502 --> 44:01.303
You do what you did to me.
You go ass over teakettle.

44:01.339 --> 44:02.922
You make it a blue-ribbon special.

44:02.924 --> 44:04.306
When she gets out of the car,

44:04.342 --> 44:06.508
you're sufferin' St. Sebastian, right?

44:06.561 --> 44:08.928
You're the hammer, okay?
You get in her face.

44:08.930 --> 44:10.563
You scare the bejesus out of her.

44:10.598 --> 44:13.399
Give me your phone. [Sniffs]

44:13.434 --> 44:15.017
It's kind of busy here, don't you think?

44:15.069 --> 44:17.503
- [Beeping]
- Well, witnesses are good.

44:17.538 --> 44:19.104
[Indistinct conversation]
Witnesses are pressure, all right?

44:19.106 --> 44:21.941
Now, once you've got her good and rattled,

44:21.943 --> 44:23.576
then you call for an ambulance,

44:23.611 --> 44:25.527
but really, you're calling for me.

44:25.580 --> 44:26.745
I'm number one on your speed dial,

44:26.781 --> 44:28.581
right next to your weed dealer.

44:28.616 --> 44:30.416
You call me. I hotfoot it over here.

44:30.451 --> 44:32.618
I just "happen" to be driving by.

44:32.620 --> 44:34.453
I stop to see what the trouble is,

44:34.455 --> 44:37.289
and this is the most important
part... You don't know me.

44:37.291 --> 44:39.124
We've never met. You got it?

44:39.126 --> 44:40.960
- Sure.
- Okay.

44:40.962 --> 44:43.963
Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight.
We go mano a mano.

44:43.965 --> 44:47.800
You light into me, okay?
Get nasty. And no touching.

44:47.802 --> 44:49.134
Leave the hair alone.

44:49.136 --> 44:51.770
But otherwise, you know, open season.

44:51.806 --> 44:54.306
Yell. Stomp. Call me a douche bag.

44:54.308 --> 44:55.608
I'm gonna play it cool,

44:55.643 --> 44:57.359
give you back some of the razzmatazz.

44:57.395 --> 44:58.978
And once she's seen the fireworks,

44:58.980 --> 45:00.396
you fold like a lawn chair...

45:00.448 --> 45:02.031
Happy ending.

45:02.066 --> 45:04.450
When do we get our money?

45:04.485 --> 45:05.985
After.

45:05.987 --> 45:08.404
After. After.

45:08.456 --> 45:09.872
You get paid when I get paid.

45:09.907 --> 45:12.074
I'm the rising tide
that raises all dinghies.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.909
Now, pop quiz... What's the car?

45:13.961 --> 45:16.545
- Mercury sable wagon.
- Baby-poop brown.

45:16.580 --> 45:18.631
- Okay. Do you know me?
- No. No.

45:18.666 --> 45:22.251
Damn straight. Go with God.

45:26.765 --> 45:31.067
Jimmy: Well, I'm just glad
I happened to be passing by.

45:31.165 --> 45:34.333
Happy to be of help, Betsy.
May I call you "Betsy"?

45:34.335 --> 45:36.752
[Clears throat] Please, call me "James."

45:36.804 --> 45:39.972
Hmm. Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry.

45:40.007 --> 45:41.390
He just got his bell rung a little.

45:41.425 --> 45:45.177
I'll... I'll handle that. Oh, no.

45:45.179 --> 45:46.762
Oh, no, no.

45:46.814 --> 45:49.348
I wouldn't think of, uh,
taking your money for this.

45:49.350 --> 45:51.767
- The embezzlement case?
- [Engine turns over]

45:51.819 --> 45:55.187
Mm, yes, I'd...
I'd be happy to talk it over.

45:55.189 --> 45:58.824
[Chuckles] Oh, shit.

46:03.330 --> 46:04.696
[Sighs]

46:04.698 --> 46:07.916
[Dialing]

46:07.952 --> 46:10.335
Two-minute warning. Two-minute warning.

46:10.371 --> 46:12.004
Got it.

46:50.577 --> 46:53.378
[Breathing heavily]

47:12.099 --> 47:13.765
[Tires screech]

47:13.767 --> 47:15.233
[Woman screams]

47:15.269 --> 47:17.269
Oh, my God!

47:17.271 --> 47:18.520
Man: What happened?

47:18.572 --> 47:20.522
- [Crowd murmuring]
- Woman: Call 911.

47:20.574 --> 47:23.742
Oh, my God! Cal! Cal!

47:23.777 --> 47:24.293
Look at me! Are you okay?!

47:24.376 --> 47:27.412
Buddy, say something. Cal, what are you...

47:27.448 --> 47:28.464
[Groans] Come on already.

47:28.546 --> 47:29.545
- What is she doing in there?
- I don't know. Shh.

47:29.580 --> 47:31.130
Is she making a sandwich?

47:31.165 --> 47:33.582
Where's her sense of responsibility?

47:33.584 --> 47:35.050
- [Tires squeal]
- What?

47:35.086 --> 47:38.470
- What?!
- Hey! What the f...

47:38.506 --> 47:39.972
Funny to run into you, Betsy.

47:40.007 --> 47:42.808
I was just, uh, strolling the neighborhood.

47:42.843 --> 47:45.811
You... You were in accident.
