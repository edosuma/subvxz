00:00.010 --> 00:01.476
Previously on "The Catch"...

00:01.479 --> 00:03.671
Before I met you, there
was a man in my life.

00:03.674 --> 00:04.573
Ethan Ward.

00:04.576 --> 00:06.295
What I would love more
than anything is...

00:06.297 --> 00:08.597
could we just start again?

00:08.633 --> 00:10.232
Ben is my fiancé.

00:10.268 --> 00:11.365
Are you seeing anyone?

00:11.367 --> 00:12.434
Her name's Gretchen.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.836
Who the bloody hell are you?

00:13.872 --> 00:15.704
I'm Troy. I am the hard drive.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.573
I look at it once, it's in here forever.

00:17.609 --> 00:19.108
What if I could tell you
where your husband is?

00:19.110 --> 00:20.743
- What?
- Special Agent Edgar Diaz.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.611
According to the file
I saw at the Bureau,

00:22.647 --> 00:24.079
Justine's husband was on assignment

00:24.115 --> 00:27.049
to infiltrate some arms
dealers, code-named Argosy.

00:27.085 --> 00:28.350
Turn around.

00:28.386 --> 00:29.281
Justine.

00:29.289 --> 00:31.220
You think I've never been betrayed?

00:31.256 --> 00:32.888
Her name was Felicity.

00:32.891 --> 00:33.766
And who knows?

00:33.769 --> 00:35.825
Maybe it's not too late
for you and Felicity.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.025
No, i-it is.

00:37.061 --> 00:38.794
I wasn't quite as forgiving as you.

00:42.391 --> 00:43.556
Felicity.

00:43.559 --> 00:45.169
I've come to cause a bit of trouble.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.150 --> 01:34.716
Up so early?

01:34.752 --> 01:36.652
I thought we might enjoy a lazy morning.

01:36.688 --> 01:39.354
I'd like to, but I have
business to attend do.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.355
Of course you have.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.356
Haven't you?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.391
As a matter of fact,

01:42.427 --> 01:44.626
what is your business these days?

01:44.662 --> 01:46.929
I couldn't help but notice
that you're not on the rolls

01:46.965 --> 01:48.631
for our India operations anymore.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.835
Did my brother's plum
assignment go sideways?

01:52.871 --> 01:55.204
You could say that.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.806
Nothing to do with that scar, I hope.

01:57.842 --> 02:00.008
It looks like a close call.

02:00.044 --> 02:01.143
It was.

02:01.179 --> 02:02.911
Tell me.

02:02.947 --> 02:06.348
One of the men who had been in charge

02:06.384 --> 02:09.585
apparently felt threatened
by my sudden advancement.

02:09.621 --> 02:11.988
So he shot you? Who was it?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.224
You have bigger things to worry about

02:15.260 --> 02:17.192
than employee relations.

02:17.228 --> 02:18.393
I heard what happened...

02:18.429 --> 02:21.363
Your brother vanishing,
your mother in prison.

02:21.399 --> 02:23.432
But then I heard you were in charge,

02:23.468 --> 02:26.435
so I thought I'd come
back to the Firm and, uh...

02:26.471 --> 02:28.537
offer my services.

02:28.573 --> 02:31.707
And how do I know I can trust you?

02:31.743 --> 02:32.941
You don't.

02:32.977 --> 02:34.910
I'll have to earn it...

02:34.946 --> 02:38.280
somehow.

02:38.316 --> 02:41.083
Mum, I'm starving. What time is...

02:42.086 --> 02:43.886
Oh, God. Don't tell me you've picked now

02:43.922 --> 02:45.120
to have a lesbian phase.

02:45.156 --> 02:48.557
Felicity, this is my daughter, Tessa.

02:57.602 --> 02:59.401
They're here.

02:59.437 --> 03:00.969
Good?

03:01.005 --> 03:01.937
You're good.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.105
Is she pretty?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.508
He definitely has a type.

03:06.444 --> 03:07.910
What does that mean?

03:09.380 --> 03:10.479
Hey, guys.

03:10.515 --> 03:13.081
Allie, I'd like you to meet my fiancée.

03:13.117 --> 03:14.116
This is Gretchen.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.585
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:16.621 --> 03:19.121
Sorry. I'm a little nervous.
I've heard so much about you.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.623
And I you.

03:22.794 --> 03:25.994
I feel like I know you already.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

03:28.600 --> 03:30.732
So, how did you two meet?

03:30.768 --> 03:32.768
At a fundraiser.

03:32.804 --> 03:34.303
For a charity that Gretchen works with.

03:34.305 --> 03:37.439
We provide meals and jobs
for L.A.'s homeless community.

03:37.475 --> 03:40.709
I'm actually hoping to
hire people from the program

03:40.745 --> 03:42.044
once we get up and running.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.513
Gretchen is about to launch
a new fashion start-up.

03:44.549 --> 03:45.814
Fashion? Really?

03:45.850 --> 03:47.816
You should see her
designs. They're incredible.

03:47.852 --> 03:48.750
Ugh.

03:48.786 --> 03:49.885
What kind of clothing?

03:49.921 --> 03:52.421
You know, elevated but wearable.

03:52.457 --> 03:54.456
That sounds fun.

03:54.492 --> 03:55.503
It is.

03:55.526 --> 03:59.361
It's a-a fun, nonprofit,
social-impact brand

03:59.397 --> 04:02.631
that empowers artisans
from Peru and Uganda.

04:02.667 --> 04:05.275
And I just got an angel investor

04:05.318 --> 04:07.125
who wants to give me the
next round of funding.

04:07.127 --> 04:09.538
Problem is, he's an old
classmate of hers from Princeton.

04:09.574 --> 04:11.139
Oh, from Princeton?

04:11.175 --> 04:13.642
Yes, his name is Charles Bergman.

04:13.678 --> 04:16.845
So, I need to be discreet
while vetting him.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.380
Which is why I suggested AVI.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.851
Is that the kind of thing that you do?

04:22.636 --> 04:23.829
All the time.

04:25.089 --> 04:26.788
Well, I don't want to impose,

04:26.824 --> 04:29.491
but, you know, Ethan
thinks the world of you.

04:29.527 --> 04:32.761
So, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind

04:32.797 --> 04:34.696
looking into Charles for me.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.834
Of course.

04:45.376 --> 04:46.508
Morning, Ben.

04:46.544 --> 04:48.243
What the hell is he still doing here?

04:48.279 --> 04:50.212
Uh, Benji, he has a name.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.146
It's Troy.

04:51.182 --> 04:52.714
And he's our guest.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.282
He's a human hard drive

04:54.318 --> 04:55.818
with a head full of government secrets.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.420
The longer he's here,
the more danger we're in.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.054
Agent Diaz, could you please tell him?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.522
He can't leave now. We need him.

05:00.558 --> 05:02.758
Yeah, Troy is instrumental
in Justine's plan

05:02.794 --> 05:04.259
to lose her badge for the man

05:04.295 --> 05:05.794
that tried to divorce her via e-mail.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.029
My husband, Eddie,

05:07.065 --> 05:09.931
is the FBI's last undercover
agent inside Argosy.

05:09.967 --> 05:11.357
McLeland's group? The gunrunners?

05:11.388 --> 05:12.768
Special Agent Edgar Diaz

05:12.804 --> 05:14.903
was part of a failed
operation to capture McLeland.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.505
When the FBI pulled their agents out,

05:16.541 --> 05:18.073
Eddie stayed in.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.275
Now it's just a matter of time

05:19.277 --> 05:20.643
before they find out who he really is,

05:20.645 --> 05:23.072
and I'd like to get him
out before they kill him.

05:23.073 --> 05:23.712
How?

05:23.715 --> 05:26.081
Well, she's gonna have me
create a new identity for him,

05:26.117 --> 05:28.517
and then we're gonna put him
on a plane and disappear him.

05:28.553 --> 05:29.651
So, why do you need Troy?

05:29.687 --> 05:31.286
Because after we extract Eddie,

05:31.322 --> 05:33.021
we're going to use
the government secrets

05:33.057 --> 05:36.092
inside Troy's brain to do
what the FBI couldn't do.

05:36.828 --> 05:38.894
We're gonna take down
McLeland and Argosy.

05:38.930 --> 05:39.728
- What?
- What?

05:39.764 --> 05:40.963
You know, just for once,

05:40.965 --> 05:43.499
I'd like to get the headlines up front.

05:52.243 --> 05:53.542
Shouldn't you be leaving?

05:53.578 --> 05:55.944
A good piece of tail
doesn't overstay her welcome.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.813
Tessa. I'll leave you two alone.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.315
Stay where you are, darling.
Finish your breakfast.

06:00.351 --> 06:01.583
So, she's not a piece of tail.

06:01.619 --> 06:03.719
Am I about to have another stepmummy?

06:03.755 --> 06:05.487
Tessa, run along.

06:05.523 --> 06:07.355
Felicity and I need to discuss a job

06:07.391 --> 06:08.657
that she's going to be helping me with.

06:08.659 --> 06:09.624
Really?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.126
Can't I help with the job?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.561
You're not old enough, I'm afraid.

06:12.597 --> 06:14.062
Then why not Dad?

06:14.098 --> 06:15.698
You two should work together more often.

06:15.700 --> 06:16.832
Because as you well know,

06:16.868 --> 06:18.767
your father no longer
works for the Firm.

06:18.803 --> 06:19.968
And she does?

06:20.004 --> 06:22.004
Yes.

06:22.940 --> 06:24.006
Provisionally.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.644
So, if you don't mind...

06:31.149 --> 06:32.681
Fine.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.288
So, what's the job?

06:40.324 --> 06:42.824
It's a trade deal I've been eyeing.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.827
I've recently acquired
a good bit of manpower

06:44.829 --> 06:45.794
here in Los Angeles.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.696
I have product coming into the port,

06:47.732 --> 06:49.397
but no clientele to sell it to.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.266
But you've found somebody who does.

06:51.302 --> 06:53.268
Matthew Keegan.

06:53.304 --> 06:56.138
He runs 12 clubs and
restaurants in the city.

06:56.174 --> 06:58.206
And he likes to supply his clients

06:58.242 --> 07:00.408
with all the pills
and powders they need.

07:00.444 --> 07:01.977
Then he must already have a supplier.

07:02.013 --> 07:03.879
He did, but I got exclusive word

07:03.882 --> 07:05.414
that he was looking for someone new.

07:05.416 --> 07:06.900
No one else knows about it yet.

07:06.903 --> 07:08.112
Well, what are you waiting for?

07:08.114 --> 07:09.819
Well, it's never wise to
show up for these things

07:09.821 --> 07:11.253
without a gift of some kind.

07:11.289 --> 07:12.654
Keegan collects rare Scotch.

07:12.690 --> 07:14.356
There's a bottle of it here in town.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.759
Legend has it that a
soldier from the AEF Siberia

07:17.795 --> 07:19.628
brought it back in 1920

07:19.664 --> 07:21.997
from the first whiskey
distillery in Japan.

07:22.033 --> 07:24.232
It's worth over $1 million.

07:24.268 --> 07:26.401
That's quite an investment.

07:26.437 --> 07:29.037
Alas, it's only available
by the $100,000 shot,

07:29.073 --> 07:31.173
so it's currently sitting, unopened,

07:31.209 --> 07:34.042
behind the bar of an illegal
gambling establishment.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.478
You and I are going to steal it.

07:36.514 --> 07:38.948
So, it's just the two of us?

07:41.050 --> 07:42.249
Morning, ladies.

07:42.252 --> 07:43.552
I have some business to attend to,

07:43.554 --> 07:44.787
so I'm gonna leave Tessa here with you.

07:44.789 --> 07:47.022
- What?
- What? You can't just leave her here.

07:47.058 --> 07:49.680
Do I not pay you both an obscene
amount of money to be my security firm?

07:49.682 --> 07:51.827
- Yes, but...
- So, secure her.

07:51.863 --> 07:53.662
Our services do not include childcare.

07:53.698 --> 07:54.864
They do if you're the stepmummy.

07:54.866 --> 07:55.964
Hello, Stepmummy.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.466
I have some security issues of my own,

07:57.468 --> 08:00.902
so I'm gonna need
Danny and, um... Sophie.

08:03.007 --> 08:04.105
There's a club.

08:04.141 --> 08:06.107
It's a sort of
less-than-legal speakeasy.

08:06.143 --> 08:07.676
It's called the Wolf's Den.

08:07.712 --> 08:10.278
It contains a bar and
several gaming tables.

08:10.314 --> 08:13.281
I need a full security
work-up on the place.

08:13.317 --> 08:15.650
Also, uh, see if the tables
are rigged while you're at it.

08:15.686 --> 08:18.620
I'm sorry. Are you asking
us to case the joint?

08:18.656 --> 08:20.755
No. I'm sure that's not...

08:20.791 --> 08:23.225
Well, as my security team,
that is your job, isn't it?

08:23.261 --> 08:25.460
It's just that, if a crime were to occur

08:25.496 --> 08:28.897
after we'd cased the joint,
we would be accessories.

08:28.933 --> 08:31.733
No crime will occur.

08:31.769 --> 08:33.034
Right?

08:33.070 --> 08:34.937
You know where to find me.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.740
We are not doing this.

08:38.775 --> 08:41.109
I... I'll... I'll talk to her.

08:47.184 --> 08:48.884
I have two questions.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.753
Where are you going?

08:51.789 --> 08:53.622
And can I come with you?

09:11.040 --> 09:14.474
To cripple Argosy, we need to take
down its leader, Billy McLeland.

09:14.477 --> 09:16.279
That's him, t-there with Eddie.

09:16.282 --> 09:17.723
Hmm. Very handsome.

09:17.759 --> 09:19.091
- Do you think?
- Thank you.

09:19.127 --> 09:21.560
You're looking at six-month-old
surveillance photos

09:21.596 --> 09:23.162
taken before the FBI bust.

09:23.198 --> 09:25.633
Eddie's team arrested six
of McLeland's lieutenants.

09:25.636 --> 09:26.439
But no McLeland.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.236
Yeah, which is why
Eddie stayed undercover.

09:28.270 --> 09:31.170
The bust sent McLeland
even deeper underground.

09:31.206 --> 09:34.106
He held on to the weapons he
was selling to other countries

09:34.142 --> 09:36.075
and has become an even bigger threat.

09:36.111 --> 09:38.178
All the more reason you should
be working with the FBI on this

09:38.180 --> 09:40.180
or at least calling Eddie and
telling him what you're doing.

09:40.182 --> 09:42.415
I can't. He'll want to protect me.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.949
He'll try to talk me out of it.

09:43.985 --> 09:45.185
You mean like the way I'm about to?

09:45.187 --> 09:46.452
I tried. She won't listen.

09:46.488 --> 09:47.694
Well, I know she won't listen to me,

09:47.696 --> 09:48.888
so I'm gonna be you for a sec...

09:48.890 --> 09:50.423
Oh, role-play. Love it.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.458
And list all the reasons
you shouldn't do this.

09:52.494 --> 09:54.360
Number one... you're
violating procedure.

09:54.396 --> 09:55.995
You're talking to me about procedure?

09:56.031 --> 09:57.997
Yeah, but he's you at the moment, so...

09:58.033 --> 09:59.131
You're stepping into

09:59.167 --> 10:00.966
an ongoing investigation
without clearance,

10:01.002 --> 10:03.436
which means you're risking
your job and our deal.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.239
You're compromising the future
of everyone in this room.

10:07.075 --> 10:08.474
You don't think we can do this.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.676
I never said that.

10:10.712 --> 10:13.379
'Cause I'm about to be you
for a second and tell you that,

10:13.415 --> 10:15.915
if Alice Vaughan were the
one trapped inside Argosy,

10:15.951 --> 10:18.118
you'd be doing exactly
what I'm about to do.

10:27.462 --> 10:29.028
Are you gonna tell Alice and Val?

10:29.064 --> 10:30.589
What, that you're dating a murderer?

10:30.592 --> 10:32.531
She is a murderer, Daniel.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.662
Or is the sex so good
that you can't see that?

10:35.665 --> 10:37.270
Ugh. Don't answer that question.

10:37.272 --> 10:38.604
It's not just about sex.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.406
Oh, so you mean you have a deep,

10:40.442 --> 10:42.274
spiritual connection to a murderer?

10:42.310 --> 10:43.642
You don't know her, okay?

10:43.678 --> 10:44.710
And you do?

10:44.746 --> 10:46.012
She's actually very complicated...

10:46.014 --> 10:47.814
She's a client and a criminal.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.383
You mean like Tommy Vaughan?

10:50.419 --> 10:52.739
You know what?

10:52.765 --> 10:54.865
Wait, are you gonna tell them or not?

10:57.159 --> 10:59.291
If that's what you're worried about,

10:59.327 --> 11:01.627
you're in worse trouble than I thought.

11:01.663 --> 11:03.396
Sophie. Hey.

11:08.203 --> 11:11.537
Guess which one of your favorite
15-year-old super criminals

11:11.573 --> 11:13.172
is in my office right now.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.507
Uh-oh. How did that happen?

11:14.543 --> 11:17.143
Apparently Margot has business,

11:17.179 --> 11:19.645
so Val and I are babysitting.

11:19.681 --> 11:21.280
I'm sorry, Allie. I'm on my way.

11:21.316 --> 11:22.648
No, no. It's fine.

11:22.684 --> 11:24.830
We're putting her to work.
I just wanted you to know.

11:26.855 --> 11:28.821
You guys still working on Ethan's case?

11:28.857 --> 11:32.291
As a matter of fact, we're not.

11:32.327 --> 11:33.359
That's good.

11:33.395 --> 11:36.095
We are working for Ethan's fiancée.

11:36.131 --> 11:37.930
- What?
- Uh-huh.

11:37.966 --> 11:39.131
Her name is Gretchen.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.134
Oh, my God. You hate her.

11:42.737 --> 11:45.771
No. She's actually very nice.

11:45.807 --> 11:46.772
Really?

11:46.808 --> 11:48.307
She is smart

11:48.343 --> 11:52.411
and very concerned about the
environment and... issues.

11:52.447 --> 11:54.113
Well, you brought this on yourself.

11:54.149 --> 11:55.381
How did I do that?

11:55.417 --> 11:56.950
The whole point of
breaking up with someone

11:56.952 --> 11:58.251
is so you never have
to see them again...

11:58.253 --> 11:59.785
or their fiancées.

11:59.821 --> 12:01.087
How would you feel if I was hanging out

12:01.089 --> 12:02.321
with Margot all the time?

12:02.357 --> 12:04.224
But you just spent an entire
day and night with her.

12:04.226 --> 12:05.658
Because we suddenly share a child.

12:05.694 --> 12:10.062
Who is approaching my office
with a look on her face.

12:10.098 --> 12:11.964
I'll call you back.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.133
Tessa and I just did a
search for Charles Bergman.

12:14.169 --> 12:15.768
Gretchen's angel investor?

12:15.804 --> 12:17.503
Almost no online presence.

12:17.539 --> 12:18.771
And I wouldn't want one, either,

12:18.773 --> 12:20.706
if I owned a string of sweatshops.

12:20.742 --> 12:23.226
Last year, two of his biggest factories

12:23.258 --> 12:27.013
got hit with massive fines
for labor-law violations.

12:27.044 --> 12:28.915
This guy should be in prison.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.250
These are human-rights violations.

12:30.252 --> 12:31.283
Which will not line up

12:31.319 --> 12:32.885
with Gretchen's plan to save humanity.

12:32.921 --> 12:35.788
One elevated-but-wearable
garment at a time.

12:35.824 --> 12:38.090
I was in Peru looking at fabrics...

12:38.126 --> 12:40.659
Well, looking for inspiration, really.

12:40.695 --> 12:43.395
Because who isn't inspired
by poverty-stricken villages

12:43.431 --> 12:45.097
teeming with starving children?

12:45.133 --> 12:47.500
I know. So humbling, right?

12:47.536 --> 12:50.236
Anyway, a young woman named Lark

12:50.272 --> 12:53.639
handed me this fabric, and it just...

12:53.675 --> 12:56.576
It instantly brought me back
to my grandmother's kitchen.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.346
Um, Gretchen.

13:00.382 --> 13:03.682
Is there someplace
private that we could talk?

13:03.718 --> 13:04.984
Sweatshops?

13:05.020 --> 13:07.253
I knew it was too good to be true.

13:07.289 --> 13:08.688
I just knew it.

13:10.559 --> 13:12.791
At least you found out before
the contracts were signed.

13:12.827 --> 13:15.294
So none of this will reflect
badly on your business.

13:15.330 --> 13:16.529
What business?

13:16.565 --> 13:18.364
Without the money...

13:18.400 --> 13:19.933
I'm sorry.

13:21.503 --> 13:27.106
It was just that Ethan was
so proud, so... relieved

13:27.142 --> 13:30.242
that I had my own thing, that
I could earn my own money.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.716
Well, you will.

13:37.752 --> 13:39.518
You're gonna get another investor.

13:39.554 --> 13:41.774
I have people that I can
set you up with right now.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.956
Alice, you don't have to do that.

13:42.958 --> 13:44.757
No. I want to. I mean it.

13:44.793 --> 13:45.959
Oh, thank you.

13:48.530 --> 13:50.329
You're setting her up with investors?

13:50.365 --> 13:51.630
Just Seth Hamilton.

13:51.666 --> 13:54.099
You should have seen her
face. I killed her dream.

13:54.135 --> 13:55.814
Her dream deserved to die.

13:56.638 --> 13:58.037
Gretchen, it's Alice.

13:58.073 --> 14:00.773
I think I do have a
potential investor for you.

14:00.809 --> 14:03.275
That's amazing. You're amazing.

14:03.311 --> 14:06.111
But... I just got the funding.

14:06.147 --> 14:08.414
Wow. That was fast. How did...

14:08.450 --> 14:09.264
Ethan.

14:09.311 --> 14:11.784
After I told him what
happened, he stepped up.

14:11.820 --> 14:14.587
He's putting up $2.5 million.

14:14.623 --> 14:16.155
Can you believe it?

14:16.191 --> 14:17.223
I can't.

14:17.259 --> 14:19.158
I know. Me neither.

14:19.194 --> 14:20.693
Oh, sorry. That's my other line.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.328
Let's grab dinner soon.

14:22.364 --> 14:23.496
What?

14:27.135 --> 14:28.821
I think that bitch just played me.

14:30.323 --> 14:31.588
Gretchen set us up.

14:31.591 --> 14:33.829
- We don't know that.
- No, she definitely set you up.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.281
She hired us to dig up
dirt on her angel investor,

14:36.317 --> 14:38.083
which she then used to convince Ethan

14:38.119 --> 14:39.084
to give her the money.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.665
So, she knew about the sweatshops?

14:40.668 --> 14:42.922
She must have. Look how easy
it was for Tessa to find them.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.022
It wasn't easy.

14:44.058 --> 14:45.223
I am warning Ethan.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.625
No. Stop. You're not doing that.

14:46.661 --> 14:47.626
I have to.

14:47.662 --> 14:48.927
Do you not think your judgment

14:48.963 --> 14:51.530
might be a little clouded
by your own experience?

14:51.566 --> 14:53.932
These just arrived, Allie.

14:53.968 --> 14:56.868
Wow! Thank you, Robin.

14:56.904 --> 14:58.504
From Ben?

14:59.474 --> 15:01.306
Mnh.

15:01.342 --> 15:02.541
From Ethan.

15:02.577 --> 15:06.244
"Thank you for being
such a good friend."

15:06.280 --> 15:08.080
Well, now you have to call him.

15:10.585 --> 15:11.717
You got the flowers?

15:11.753 --> 15:13.552
That was very generous of you.

15:13.588 --> 15:15.153
It is the least I could do.

15:15.189 --> 15:19.091
And I heard the big news...
Your latest investment.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.493
Gretchen told you.

15:21.529 --> 15:22.728
She did.

15:22.764 --> 15:26.064
Again... Very generous of you.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.366
I know it's a lot,

15:27.402 --> 15:29.901
but she's been working on
this project for a long time.

15:29.937 --> 15:31.703
- How long?
- Um...

15:31.739 --> 15:33.438
- Since before you met her, right?
- Yeah.

15:33.474 --> 15:34.573
And how long was that?

15:36.544 --> 15:38.643
Eight months. What are you asking?

15:38.679 --> 15:40.374
Nothing. I just...

15:40.405 --> 15:43.081
As someone who used to...

15:43.117 --> 15:45.183
work with you, I'm...

15:45.219 --> 15:47.085
You think she's after
me just for my money.

15:47.121 --> 15:49.221
No. Not at all.

15:49.257 --> 15:50.222
That's not what...

15:50.258 --> 15:51.957
We already have a prenup, Allie,

15:51.993 --> 15:53.859
which she insisted on, by the way.

15:53.895 --> 15:56.094
She also just took
$2.5 million from you,

15:56.130 --> 15:57.430
which is completely separate from that.

15:57.432 --> 15:59.564
Yes, because I offered it.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.322
Um...

16:01.353 --> 16:02.868
should I not have called?

16:02.870 --> 16:05.203
No. No, look. I'm glad you did.

16:05.239 --> 16:08.840
And I appreciate you looking out for me.

16:08.876 --> 16:09.975
Okay?

16:15.249 --> 16:16.581
He's actually glad I called.

16:16.617 --> 16:18.016
Mm-hmm.

16:18.052 --> 16:20.486
And if you believe that,
then he just played you, too.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.724
Argosy's internal
hierarchy is pretty simple.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.894
And these are the major
players, from McLeland on down.

16:28.930 --> 16:30.996
Somebody has earned himself a power bar.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.898
Where do they get their automatics?

16:32.934 --> 16:34.567
They're usually bought
or stolen secondhand.

16:34.569 --> 16:36.134
And secondhand means second-rate.

16:36.170 --> 16:37.745
What are you thinking?

16:37.784 --> 16:40.039
To draw McLeland out, we've
got to offer him something

16:40.041 --> 16:41.440
none of his other suppliers can...

16:41.476 --> 16:42.707
A first-rate arsenal.

16:42.743 --> 16:43.875
You want to give a gunrunner

16:43.911 --> 16:45.744
top-notch weaponry we don't have?

16:45.780 --> 16:47.012
Mm-hmm.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.713
Rhys, you still have your contact

16:48.749 --> 16:50.399
from when you did business with Argosy?

16:50.453 --> 16:52.517
Yeah. Uh, this guy here...

16:52.553 --> 16:53.585
Ryan Gilbert.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.654
I'll need you to
arrange an introduction.

16:55.690 --> 16:57.189
You tell him you know a DoD official

16:57.225 --> 16:58.705
who's looking to make some extra bank

16:58.726 --> 17:01.526
by unloading military-grade
automatics and semi-automatics.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.295
Well, of course you
haven't heard of him.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.163
The man works for the
Department of Defense.

17:05.199 --> 17:08.700
He has clearance at the highest
level and unlimited access.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.636
All that I'll need to show
them is a sample of the goods...

17:13.448 --> 17:15.473
Which you'll borrow
from the Bureau's armory.

17:15.476 --> 17:17.476
AR-15 selective-fire rifle,

17:17.512 --> 17:20.145
designed specifically
for the U.S. Armed Forces.

17:20.181 --> 17:21.378
Mark 18, short barrel

17:21.415 --> 17:23.714
with modified bolt
carrier and gas block.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.141
Military A-2 birdcage flash hider.

17:26.174 --> 17:27.172
What about fouling?

17:27.188 --> 17:28.821
Piston-operated. Fouling is minimized.

17:28.823 --> 17:30.188
Pistons cause carrier tilt.

17:30.224 --> 17:32.191
Not with manually modified variants.

17:36.003 --> 17:37.202
Well, let's talk price.

17:37.227 --> 17:38.730
Two grand a pop...

17:38.766 --> 17:41.166
times 300 of these from my
connect at Fort Riverside.

17:41.202 --> 17:42.167
You're getting a deal.

17:42.203 --> 17:43.535
At two grand a pop?

17:43.571 --> 17:45.104
That's my price, or I walk.

17:46.207 --> 17:47.205
All right. I walk.

17:49.176 --> 17:50.475
Just wait.

17:50.511 --> 17:53.111
I'm not authorized to
make a deal at that rate.

17:53.147 --> 17:55.347
But... my boss is.

17:55.383 --> 17:56.715
I'm happy to meet with him.

17:56.751 --> 18:00.119
Only thing is, he's gonna want
all of the guns at the meet.

18:03.758 --> 18:05.624
- Allie.
- Incoming.

18:05.660 --> 18:08.827
- Who the hell do you think that you are?
- Gretchen.

18:08.863 --> 18:11.400
Did you think that he was gonna leave
me for you? Is that what you thought?

18:11.402 --> 18:12.163
Um...

18:12.199 --> 18:13.699
Could we have a moment, please?

18:19.273 --> 18:21.193
Look, I think there's
been some misunderstanding.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.402
So, you didn't tell Ethan

18:22.425 --> 18:24.343
- that I was only after him for his money?
- I never said...

18:24.345 --> 18:26.711
- I have an MBA from Columbia.
- I never meant to imply...

18:26.747 --> 18:29.582
He loved you, and you left him.

18:31.552 --> 18:33.118
Haven't you done enough damage?

18:35.790 --> 18:37.455
We've scoped out the Wolf's Den,

18:37.491 --> 18:39.090
and the house staff is all positioned

18:39.126 --> 18:40.592
with a view of the gaming tables.

18:40.628 --> 18:42.027
The cameras are focused on the players,

18:42.029 --> 18:43.528
armed security at every door.

18:43.564 --> 18:45.564
And the blackjack and
craps tables are set up

18:45.600 --> 18:47.499
so the house controls the outcome.

18:47.535 --> 18:48.982
Also, there's a roulette wheel.

18:49.029 --> 18:50.101
It's actually the one game

18:50.137 --> 18:51.836
that the house doesn't have to cheat.

18:51.872 --> 18:53.538
Good.

18:53.574 --> 18:54.873
You can go.

18:54.909 --> 18:56.174
I'll take it from here.

18:56.210 --> 18:58.243
Uh, um...

18:58.279 --> 18:59.578
Was there anything else?

19:00.748 --> 19:03.114
Are you sure there isn't
anything else that we can do?

19:03.150 --> 19:04.783
Do you need backup on this or...

19:04.819 --> 19:06.084
No.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.623
Okay.

19:11.659 --> 19:14.659
Actually, if you want to help...

19:14.695 --> 19:17.863
find out everything you can
about this man's financials.

19:20.635 --> 19:22.234
Matthew Keegan.

19:23.738 --> 19:25.571
Ideally sooner rather than later.

19:41.522 --> 19:42.487
11 black.

19:58.639 --> 20:00.385
I'll need to search your bag, ma'am.

20:02.843 --> 20:04.576
Enjoy, ladies.

20:15.222 --> 20:16.755
The bottle is still unopened.

20:16.791 --> 20:20.158
Well, $100,000 a shot is a
pretty steep asking price.

20:20.194 --> 20:22.428
I suppose we'll have to win big then.

20:23.798 --> 20:25.898
Give it some juice just to test it.

20:33.507 --> 20:35.173
Let's take it for a spin.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.313
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.483
Red 23.

20:58.232 --> 20:59.230
Red 23.

20:59.266 --> 21:01.900
I won.

21:02.269 --> 21:04.002
Black 22.

21:04.038 --> 21:05.437
Black 22.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.738
Red 25.

21:06.774 --> 21:09.240
Red 25.

21:09.276 --> 21:11.476
I'm a bit thirsty.

21:11.512 --> 21:13.578
How about you get us a
shot of the good stuff?

21:13.614 --> 21:16.548
I think that's a fine idea.

21:19.386 --> 21:21.019
The Scotch, please.

21:30.931 --> 21:32.731
Black 24.

21:32.767 --> 21:33.765
24 black.

21:39.573 --> 21:42.007
What the hell is that?
What are you trying to pull?

21:42.777 --> 21:44.843
This ball is clearly defective.

21:44.879 --> 21:46.244
She's cheating.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.613
Everybody, calm down.

21:47.615 --> 21:49.814
I swear I don't know what's happened.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.583
Security, coming through.

21:51.619 --> 21:53.418
Hey, what's the story here?

21:54.054 --> 21:55.220
Nobody move.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.459
Somebody's obviously been cheating,

22:01.495 --> 22:03.027
but I assure you, it isn't me.

22:03.063 --> 22:05.297
This isn't the house ball.
Someone switched them.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.133
Search me if you like.

22:08.169 --> 22:10.002
Oh, we're going to search
everyone at this table,

22:10.004 --> 22:11.470
starting with you.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.275
She's clean, aside from the pistol.

22:17.311 --> 22:19.519
Hey, I think I got something over here.

22:23.047 --> 22:24.149
What the hell is that?

22:25.019 --> 22:27.786
Looks like the house
ball. He switched them.

22:27.822 --> 22:29.955
- No, it wasn't me.
- That's it. You're out of here. Let's go.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.456
- It was not me.
- I said let's go!

22:31.492 --> 22:32.891
It was not me. I'm telling you!

22:32.927 --> 22:34.092
I didn't do this!

22:34.128 --> 22:36.094
Come on. Come on.

22:36.130 --> 22:37.929
I'm afraid you and your companion

22:37.965 --> 22:39.125
are also gonna have to leave.

22:39.133 --> 22:40.632
Violation of house rules.

22:40.668 --> 22:43.067
Let's go, ma'am.

22:55.349 --> 22:57.081
I told you not to bring your gun.

22:57.117 --> 22:58.349
You almost got us killed.

22:58.385 --> 23:01.420
Just tell me I didn't
almost die for nothing.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.625
What the hell is that?
What are you trying to pull?

23:07.661 --> 23:09.027
She's cheating.

23:09.063 --> 23:12.230
Get out of the way! Security!
Everybody, calm down.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.332
Oh, we're going to search
everyone at this table.

23:14.368 --> 23:16.601
Shame we can't have a taste.

23:16.637 --> 23:19.771
Well, there are other ways to celebrate.

23:22.982 --> 23:24.348
It was horrible.

23:24.396 --> 23:28.616
Gretchen was so angry.

23:28.652 --> 23:30.151
And she had every right to be.

23:30.187 --> 23:31.485
I'm so sorry, babe.

23:31.521 --> 23:34.555
Don't be sorry for me. I'm
the bad guy in this story.

23:34.591 --> 23:35.590
No, you're not.

23:35.626 --> 23:36.824
I am.

23:36.860 --> 23:37.792
How is that?

23:37.828 --> 23:39.193
Because before you met me,

23:39.229 --> 23:41.028
you gave everybody
you met, including me,

23:41.064 --> 23:43.097
the benefit of the doubt.

23:43.133 --> 23:45.499
And now everybody you
meet is a con artist.

23:45.535 --> 23:48.636
Most people really are only
interested in themselves.

23:48.672 --> 23:51.305
As a con artist,

23:51.341 --> 23:54.075
I used to think that was always true...

23:54.111 --> 23:55.810
until I met you.

23:57.147 --> 23:59.880
You changed me.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.883
Or at least made me want to change.

24:10.661 --> 24:12.794
And you were right.

24:13.688 --> 24:16.263
I shouldn't have gotten
involved with Ethan.

24:19.070 --> 24:22.238
I just hope I haven't
ruined his life again.

24:22.274 --> 24:24.807
Allie...

24:24.843 --> 24:26.075
you made his day.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.212
He put that woman in
front of you for a reason.

24:29.214 --> 24:32.281
Yeah, so that I could see how
much better she is than me.

24:32.317 --> 24:34.017
First of all, she's not.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.654
And second of all, yes, exactly.

24:39.658 --> 24:41.357
He wants to know you still care.

24:41.393 --> 24:44.193
Well, I don't.

24:46.598 --> 24:48.097
You don't believe me.

24:50.869 --> 24:53.769
What can I do to convince you?

24:53.805 --> 24:55.271
Well, you take requests?

24:55.307 --> 24:56.706
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

25:07.118 --> 25:08.284
Morning.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.552
What are you doing here?

25:09.588 --> 25:11.954
Working... on the Gretchen case.

25:11.990 --> 25:14.059
There is no Gretchen case. We're done.

25:14.090 --> 25:15.724
So you don't care that she's a fraud.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.593
I don't know that she's a fraud.

25:17.629 --> 25:19.184
I do. Look.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.997
I know you don't like her clothes...

25:20.999 --> 25:23.198
Oh, that's just it.
They're not her clothes.

25:23.234 --> 25:24.967
This flowy little number?

25:25.003 --> 25:27.736
Remember how it came to
her in a Peruvian dream?

25:27.772 --> 25:28.838
Vaguely.

25:31.076 --> 25:34.410
It was Liz Dennis' dream,
Summer Collection 2014.

25:34.446 --> 25:37.179
And this one... Sandra Drew.

25:37.215 --> 25:38.581
They're all somebody else's.

25:38.617 --> 25:40.616
When did you take these?

25:40.652 --> 25:42.751
When she was crying on your shoulder,

25:42.787 --> 25:43.919
I was investigating.

25:45.090 --> 25:46.489
I thought that's what
you were paying me to do.

25:46.491 --> 25:48.290
- Unpaid intern.
- We'll discuss it.

25:48.326 --> 25:50.225
So, these are all knock-offs?

25:50.261 --> 25:51.361
Or they're straight off the rack

25:51.363 --> 25:53.162
and she's replacing the tags.

25:53.198 --> 25:56.833
But if she's lying about this,
what else is she lying about?

25:58.536 --> 26:00.102
I kind of want to hug you right now.

26:00.138 --> 26:03.072
Oh, I think you should resist that urge.

26:03.108 --> 26:05.708
This woman's business is a total sham.

26:05.744 --> 26:07.443
What about the people
we saw working there?

26:07.445 --> 26:08.644
Could they have been plants?

26:08.680 --> 26:10.579
Not according to Gretchen's tax records.

26:10.615 --> 26:12.114
They're real employees.

26:12.150 --> 26:14.984
What about the showroom? Does
that building belong to Ethan?

26:15.787 --> 26:17.553
No, Gretchen's name is on the lease.

26:17.589 --> 26:18.821
She was shipping things.

26:18.857 --> 26:20.623
I mean, if her designs are fake,

26:20.659 --> 26:23.459
why risk exposure by selling
the dresses to the public?

26:25.163 --> 26:27.830
Unless... Zoom in on
the shipping labels.

26:30.201 --> 26:32.034
Oh, my God.

26:32.070 --> 26:34.270
They're all going to the same address.

26:35.373 --> 26:38.341
358 Clay Street in Santa Monica.

26:39.811 --> 26:43.412
The owner is listed as Joel Hanson.

26:43.448 --> 26:44.780
Joel Hanson.

26:46.017 --> 26:47.916
Oh, my God.

26:47.952 --> 26:50.319
Joel Hanson...

26:50.355 --> 26:53.722
is her angel investor Charles Bergman.

26:53.758 --> 26:55.090
They were in on it together.

26:55.126 --> 26:57.459
But Charles Bergman was real.
You found the sweatshops.

26:57.495 --> 26:59.528
But there were no
photos online, remember?

26:59.564 --> 27:01.296
Which they used to their advantage.

27:01.332 --> 27:04.133
She even had me fooled... briefly.

27:04.169 --> 27:06.235
She must be destroyed.

27:06.271 --> 27:07.569
We have to tell Ethan.

27:07.605 --> 27:08.804
I already told him once.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.140
Whatever I tell him now,
he's not gonna believe me.

27:18.616 --> 27:19.682
Going to see Margot?

27:19.718 --> 27:21.917
I'm going to deliver
the intel on Keegan.

27:21.953 --> 27:23.653
You could just as easily
e-mail that to her.

27:23.655 --> 27:25.651
- Sophie...
- Or give it to me. I'll deliver it.

27:26.958 --> 27:27.990
Why do you care?

27:28.026 --> 27:29.825
Why don't you? She's just using you.

27:29.861 --> 27:31.127
Well, maybe I'm using her, too.

27:31.995 --> 27:33.529
Yeah, well, the difference is,

27:33.531 --> 27:35.397
you're the one who's gonna end up dead.

27:47.145 --> 27:49.044
Are you calling to check up on me?

27:49.080 --> 27:51.380
I am. How was AVI yesterday?

27:51.416 --> 27:54.550
I'm at AVI today, as well.
Did Alice not tell you?

27:54.586 --> 27:57.720
Oh, but then she's, uh...
she's off with Ethan, isn't she?

27:57.756 --> 28:00.522
Is she? And where are they today?

28:00.558 --> 28:03.192
She wouldn't say, and she
wouldn't let me tag along,

28:03.228 --> 28:04.927
but I'm sure it's all innocent,

28:04.963 --> 28:06.462
probably nothing to worry about.

28:06.498 --> 28:08.530
I hear what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

28:08.566 --> 28:09.965
I have no idea what you mean.

28:10.001 --> 28:11.133
You're making trouble.

28:11.169 --> 28:13.035
If there's trouble, I'm
not the one making it.

28:13.071 --> 28:15.170
Your mother and I are
not getting back together.

28:15.206 --> 28:16.405
I love Alice.

28:16.441 --> 28:18.173
And Ethan is about to get married.

28:18.209 --> 28:19.508
Not anymore, he's not,

28:19.544 --> 28:21.777
not if Alice has
anything to say about it.

28:21.813 --> 28:23.812
What does that mean?

28:23.848 --> 28:25.481
I'd tell you,

28:25.517 --> 28:28.417
but I wouldn't want to make trouble.

28:39.330 --> 28:41.029
Oi! You two, enough.

28:41.065 --> 28:44.634
Eddie, your wife has something
she would like to tell you.

28:45.870 --> 28:48.570
So... you know how we've been trying

28:48.606 --> 28:50.305
toet you away from Argosy,

28:50.341 --> 28:51.641
trying to get you out of the country.

28:51.643 --> 28:53.342
- Well, we're not gonna do that anymore.
- Why not?

28:53.344 --> 28:55.978
Because I think we found
a way to get to McLeland

28:56.014 --> 28:57.179
and take Argosy down.

28:57.215 --> 28:58.647
So you guys can be together.

28:58.683 --> 29:00.349
I can't make any promises, but...

29:00.385 --> 29:01.617
I knew you wouldn't leave this alone.

29:01.619 --> 29:02.246
Baby...

29:02.249 --> 29:06.321
Now I'm gonna have to do to
you what I did to McLeland.

29:06.357 --> 29:07.657
You killed McLeland?

29:08.693 --> 29:10.426
And now you're in charge of Argosy.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.573
We couldn't meet at your office?

29:30.609 --> 29:32.609
No. Sorry.

29:33.949 --> 29:36.436
Are you at least gonna tell
me what we're doing here then?

29:36.480 --> 29:38.314
I will.

29:38.350 --> 29:40.551
But first I'm gonna
tell you how I met Ben.

29:42.354 --> 29:44.320
Okay.

29:44.356 --> 29:46.489
Val and I were working a case.

29:46.525 --> 29:49.859
There was this man
that we called Mister X

29:49.895 --> 29:52.048
who was stealing our clients' money

29:52.095 --> 29:54.130
and using our intel to do it.

29:54.166 --> 29:56.733
And we couldn't figure out how.

29:56.769 --> 29:59.536
Meanwhile...

29:59.572 --> 30:02.105
I was engaged to a man
named Christopher Hall.

30:02.141 --> 30:05.708
Who turned out to be Mister X.

30:05.744 --> 30:08.712
Who turned out to be Benjamin Jones.

30:11.483 --> 30:12.816
Your Benjamin Jones?

30:13.886 --> 30:15.218
Is a con artist.

30:15.254 --> 30:16.753
Was a con artist.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.494
Why are you telling me this?

30:24.530 --> 30:27.297
Because if somebody had tried
to tell me Ben was using me,

30:27.333 --> 30:28.966
I wouldn't have believed them.

30:29.935 --> 30:32.336
I had to see it for myself.

30:37.543 --> 30:38.708
Wait. Wait. Is that, uh...

30:38.744 --> 30:42.178
Charles Bergman...
Gretchen's angel investor.

30:42.214 --> 30:45.182
His real name is Joel Hanson.

30:47.987 --> 30:50.153
He's Gretchen's husband.

30:56.295 --> 30:57.683
Don't even... Not a word.

30:57.685 --> 31:00.519
You're gonna be so happy.

31:07.606 --> 31:10.506
This, Mr. Keegan, is merely a sample

31:10.542 --> 31:13.910
of the kind of indulgences
with which I can supply you

31:13.946 --> 31:15.578
and your establishments.

31:15.614 --> 31:18.615
I am also prepared to
come in at 10% below

31:18.651 --> 31:21.284
your previous arrangements
for the first year

31:21.320 --> 31:23.304
in a further gesture of goodwill.

31:23.307 --> 31:24.821
And that is very generous of you...

31:24.823 --> 31:27.290
What's it gonna take, Mr. Keegan?

31:29.428 --> 31:31.228
I already made a deal with someone else.

31:32.331 --> 31:33.763
You and I had an understanding.

31:33.799 --> 31:34.931
Yes, I know, but I...

31:34.967 --> 31:36.500
No one else was to
know you were looking.

31:36.502 --> 31:38.868
And I told no one.

31:38.904 --> 31:40.337
But this guy knew.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.674
Did you tell anyone?

31:44.810 --> 31:46.076
Matthew Keegan.

31:47.846 --> 31:50.179
What's his name, your new supplier?

31:50.215 --> 31:52.882
I don't know who this guy is, okay?

31:52.918 --> 31:55.218
All I know is he goes
by some code name...

31:55.254 --> 31:56.353
"Mockingbird."

31:58.424 --> 32:00.490
So, what's our next move?

32:00.526 --> 32:02.992
We can get the police involved.

32:03.028 --> 32:05.828
We can certainly get your money back.

32:05.864 --> 32:08.165
But it's up to you if
you want to press charges.

32:09.702 --> 32:12.402
Did you... press charges against Ben?

32:12.438 --> 32:14.570
I didn't.

32:14.606 --> 32:15.838
Right, because...

32:15.874 --> 32:17.473
My story's a little different.

32:17.509 --> 32:18.575
Yeah.

32:20.779 --> 32:25.081
What are the odds of both of
us being taken by con artists?

32:25.109 --> 32:27.475
I mean, is that really what's out there?

32:27.519 --> 32:29.585
We're targets, you and me.

32:29.621 --> 32:31.788
You are an extremely wealthy man.

32:31.824 --> 32:35.391
My job is to protect
people like you, so...

32:35.427 --> 32:37.727
And you did.

32:37.763 --> 32:39.596
You did protect me.

32:41.467 --> 32:43.433
I was gonna marry her, Allie.

32:43.469 --> 32:45.334
Eh, I couldn't let you do that.

32:45.370 --> 32:47.003
No.

32:47.039 --> 32:50.006
So... I want to put you on retainer

32:50.042 --> 32:52.575
to work for me, exclusively.

32:52.611 --> 32:54.310
What?

32:54.346 --> 32:57.914
I need someone to protect me full time,

32:57.950 --> 32:59.182
someone I can trust.

32:59.218 --> 33:01.485
I'll be paying you a fortune, of course.

33:02.988 --> 33:05.088
All you need to do is say yes.

33:11.897 --> 33:13.730
You've reached Justine Diaz.

33:13.766 --> 33:15.264
Please leave a message.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.380
I don't know where you are,

33:16.401 --> 33:19.102
but I am in play and going in now.

33:19.138 --> 33:21.271
You guys better be in position.

33:22.841 --> 33:25.108
Ben has no idea we're hostages up here.

33:25.144 --> 33:26.576
He thinks we're here as backup.

33:26.612 --> 33:28.377
He's gonna die out there.

33:28.413 --> 33:29.679
And we're gonna die in here.

33:33.519 --> 33:36.153
Mr. Hunt. This is my boss.

33:39.992 --> 33:42.658
Andy Hunt, Department of Defense.

33:42.694 --> 33:43.659
Mr. Hunt.

33:43.695 --> 33:45.828
I told you, Eddie was a bad guy.

33:45.864 --> 33:47.730
Maybe now's not the
time for "I told you so."

33:47.766 --> 33:49.932
Maybe Eddie's just pretending to be bad.

33:49.968 --> 33:53.503
No. He's... He's stopped pretending.

34:00.813 --> 34:03.246
Maybe it's time I stopped, as well.

34:03.282 --> 34:04.313
What does that mean?

34:04.349 --> 34:06.282
It means...

34:06.318 --> 34:10.152
I've been on best behavior
for you, for the FBI,

34:10.188 --> 34:13.556
hoping to convince you
that I'm not a bad guy...

34:17.062 --> 34:18.194
Rhys.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.896
But I am.

34:23.569 --> 34:25.368
I am a bad guy.

34:25.404 --> 34:26.484
Come on.

34:26.505 --> 34:27.536
We can't leave Benji
out there on his own.

34:27.539 --> 34:29.406
He's not on his own.

34:31.143 --> 34:33.176
All right, enough small talk, Mr. Hunt.

34:33.212 --> 34:34.411
Let's see what you brought us.

34:35.746 --> 34:37.147
Happy to oblige.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.351
Hands up!

34:43.388 --> 34:44.219
Don't move!

34:44.255 --> 34:45.522
Down!

34:47.693 --> 34:49.592
Baby, listen to me.
Justine, I can explai...

34:52.164 --> 34:54.931
I'm so glad I'm the one
that gets to do this.

34:56.902 --> 34:58.568
Oh, by the way...

34:58.604 --> 35:00.770
we're getting divorced.

35:09.019 --> 35:11.394
Do you think she's all right?

35:11.467 --> 35:12.599
Would you be?

35:12.618 --> 35:14.094
Of course... but then again,

35:14.130 --> 35:15.929
I don't care about anyone or anything.

35:20.636 --> 35:21.801
What?

35:21.837 --> 35:22.836
Nothing.

35:22.872 --> 35:23.536
Drink?

35:23.572 --> 35:24.704
No, thank you.

35:24.740 --> 35:27.374
They're expecting me at the Bureau.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.542
Will you have to see Eddie?

35:29.578 --> 35:30.810
Not if I can help it.

35:30.846 --> 35:32.812
So, what happens to Eddie now?

35:32.848 --> 35:34.547
If there is any justice in the world,

35:34.583 --> 35:36.616
he will die of old age in prison.

35:36.652 --> 35:38.518
Remind me not to piss you off.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.387
I do, constantly.

35:41.857 --> 35:43.823
And what happens to me?

35:43.859 --> 35:46.192
Eddie's in custody,

35:46.228 --> 35:48.094
Argosy is gone,

35:48.130 --> 35:50.197
so you're free to go.

35:51.300 --> 35:52.866
However, if you feel

35:52.902 --> 35:55.268
like putting that hard drive
in your head to good use,

35:55.304 --> 35:57.805
I will happily recommend
you to the Bureau.

36:03.212 --> 36:04.431
I'll see you boys later.

36:05.581 --> 36:06.880
Justine.

36:11.354 --> 36:12.385
Are you all right?

36:23.199 --> 36:25.031
Well, gentlemen, it's been fun...

36:25.067 --> 36:26.933
and life-threatening, as usual.

36:26.969 --> 36:27.701
Troy.

36:31.540 --> 36:33.040
You take care of yourself.

36:45.488 --> 36:46.686
I don't know what to do.

36:46.722 --> 36:49.723
Well, you're a free man

36:49.759 --> 36:52.292
with a flawless memory
and a body to match,

36:52.328 --> 36:55.695
so anything you'd
like, I should imagine.

36:55.731 --> 36:56.663
Can I stay with you?

36:57.833 --> 37:00.367
- As much as I would enjoy that...
- Why not?

37:00.403 --> 37:03.504
Because bad things happen
to people who stay with me.

37:05.007 --> 37:06.740
Hey, call Justine.

37:06.776 --> 37:08.475
You already look like a superhero.

37:08.511 --> 37:10.844
Now go and be one.

37:13.482 --> 37:14.848
You're a good man, Rhys Griffiths.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.384
Ooh, enough of that. Bad for the brand.

37:37.740 --> 37:38.605
Hi.

37:38.641 --> 37:40.006
Hey.

37:40.042 --> 37:41.741
Where is everybody?

37:41.777 --> 37:42.810
In there.

37:45.581 --> 37:46.846
What's going on in there?

37:46.882 --> 37:48.047
Whatever it is,

37:48.083 --> 37:50.017
it's been going on a long time.

37:51.787 --> 37:53.753
Hey. You didn't have to pick her up.

37:53.789 --> 37:54.788
I could have driven her home.

37:54.790 --> 37:56.070
I figured I'd save you the trip.

37:56.997 --> 37:59.859
All right. You kids chat.

37:59.895 --> 38:01.428
I'll be downstairs...

38:01.464 --> 38:03.129
waiting.

38:07.269 --> 38:10.870
So... it turns out Ethan's fiancée

38:10.906 --> 38:12.205
is not who she claimed to be.

38:12.241 --> 38:14.774
I am sorry to hear that...

38:14.810 --> 38:16.443
for so many reasons.

38:16.479 --> 38:18.711
Stop. We're just working together.

38:18.747 --> 38:21.681
But I will call you when we are done.

38:21.717 --> 38:24.884
Done with what? I thought
you solved the case.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.921
I did...

38:27.957 --> 38:30.056
which is when Ethan offered
to put us on retainer

38:30.092 --> 38:31.725
exclusively. Exclusively?

38:32.627 --> 38:34.228
So you'd only be working for Ethan.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.095
I know what you're gonna say.

38:35.097 --> 38:37.263
- Allie...
- It's a lot of money.

38:37.299 --> 38:39.466
You see what he's doing, right?

38:39.502 --> 38:40.600
Yes, I do.

38:40.636 --> 38:42.902
He is hiring me because
I am very good at my job.

38:42.938 --> 38:45.538
He's trying to own you,
just like he did before.

38:45.574 --> 38:47.841
Okay. We're done talking about this.

38:47.877 --> 38:49.142
How can you not see that?

38:49.178 --> 38:50.944
How can you have such little
faith in my intelligence?

38:50.946 --> 38:52.446
- This has nothing to do with you.
- And my judgment?

38:52.448 --> 38:53.480
This is all him.

38:53.516 --> 38:55.148
This is a business decision,

38:55.184 --> 38:57.550
and I will take your
opinion under advisement.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.453
Allie. You should go.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.889
I'm going back to my client.

39:19.375 --> 39:20.807
Where is she?

39:23.812 --> 39:24.944
What are you talking about?

39:24.980 --> 39:26.179
Felicity.

39:26.215 --> 39:28.448
You sent her to me, she
told you about Keegan,

39:28.484 --> 39:30.116
and then you swooped in and made a deal.

39:30.152 --> 39:32.318
What?

39:32.354 --> 39:34.321
You are working with her. Just admit it.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.225
Is something funny?

39:40.396 --> 39:42.229
Darling, listen to me.

39:43.632 --> 39:45.064
I killed Felicity.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.032
What, today?

39:46.068 --> 39:47.400
No. Months ago.

39:47.436 --> 39:49.169
- No. It's impossible.
- Well, I'm not proud of it, but...

39:49.171 --> 39:50.771
I just had sex with her.

39:51.974 --> 39:53.473
She's alive.

40:00.858 --> 40:02.090
Ben.

40:02.113 --> 40:03.616
Hey, I thought you took off.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.184
I came back to talk to you, actually.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.097
Oh?

40:06.100 --> 40:07.787
Yeah, Alice told me about your offer.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.089
Oh. Well, she hasn't
said yes yet, but...

40:10.125 --> 40:11.491
Do me a favor.

40:11.527 --> 40:13.961
Find another private
investigation and security firm.

40:15.431 --> 40:16.663
Why would I do that?

40:19.935 --> 40:21.935
You should give Alice more credit.

40:21.971 --> 40:23.670
She knows what she's doing.

40:23.706 --> 40:25.838
She's smart. She's strong.

40:25.874 --> 40:29.142
She deserves better, don't you think?

40:29.178 --> 40:30.944
You mean better than me.

40:30.980 --> 40:34.347
Alice will make up her own mind.

40:34.383 --> 40:35.915
There's nothing you can do about it.

40:35.951 --> 40:37.984
- You don't think?
- No.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.986
No, because you're a criminal.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.855
And the second that you
try and do anything to me,

40:42.891 --> 40:44.891
she will see that
that's all that you are.

40:44.927 --> 40:47.661
And she will leave you.

40:49.932 --> 40:51.765
It's good talking with you, Ben.

40:53.154 --> 40:54.853
I'm sure I'll see you around.
