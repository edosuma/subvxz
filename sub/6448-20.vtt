You may be really good at staying
one step ahead of Checkmate...

35:28.376 --> 35:30.617
...but you don't know
the ﬁrst thing about me.

35:30.795 --> 35:36.040
You say you're saving the planet
but you really only care about yourself.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.383
You ﬁgured out Maxwell's charade
because you knew in your heart...

35:39.554 --> 35:41.715
...that Oliver's declaration of love
was a lie.

35:45.226 --> 35:49.686
You can't comprehend what it means
to truly protect someone you love.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.522
And stay away from Clark Kent.

35:54.735 --> 36:00.071
If you're not careful, you'll end up on
the wrong side of the coming apocalypse.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.421
Oh, my God, Perry.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.181
You've raised the dead.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.434
You have single-handedly
brought my ﬁatlined career back to life.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.597
No big deal. I just put in a good word
with your boss, Stern.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.108
Well, I will never forget this.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.025
And neither will Clark.

36:44.118 --> 36:45.358
We make a good team, kid.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.619
Oh, I got a line on the Red Queen.
Nairobi.

36:48.789 --> 36:49.949
I'm ﬂying out tomorrow.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.206
Tomorrow? What about you and Mrs. K.?

36:52.376 --> 36:54.628
Oh, I'm not giving up on her yet.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.377
Martha's one story
I'm not sharing with anyone.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.298
So what do you say, kid. Africa?

37:02.970 --> 37:07.339
Normally, I would jump at the chance
at running away from my problems.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.517
After one day in the trenches
with Perry White...

37:11.687 --> 37:15.805
...I realized I don't have to go anywhere
to ﬁnd my higher calling. I just....

37:16.943 --> 37:19.650
I needed to ﬁnd the hero inside myself.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.147
Goodbye, Lane. You're the real deal.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.156
See you, chief.

37:26.911 --> 37:30.824
Oh, and tell Clark we're even.

37:30.998 --> 37:33.705
I owed him one from a long time ago.

37:50.142 --> 37:51.473
[WHOOSH]

38:25.344 --> 38:28.632
I can't believe you have to go back
to being Senator Kent today.

38:29.181 --> 38:33.345
When it's just the two of us here,
I'm your mom and nobody else.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.020
I wish you could come back
and visit more often.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.148
I had to let go of this place
for a while, Clark...

38:41.319 --> 38:43.401
...but I never let go of you.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.731
I'll be back soon.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.983
Maybe next time you can ease up
on the kryptonite.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.447
Clark, what on earth
are you talking about?

38:55.666 --> 39:00.080
You kept me in the house for dinner so your
people could track down the Book of Rao.

39:00.254 --> 39:04.714
Once you knew that Perry and Lois were on
to you, you had to throw them off the trail.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.886
You are the Red Queen.

39:11.223 --> 39:12.884
Why didn't you come to me with this?

39:19.523 --> 39:21.855
Because I didn't want you
in the line of ﬁre.

39:23.235 --> 39:25.521
So you dragged
Perry White along instead?

39:26.113 --> 39:28.820
I had no idea he was on the trail.

39:30.117 --> 39:32.779
You know, he makes me laugh.
He makes me feel like...

39:32.953 --> 39:35.615
...everything's gonna be okay.

39:36.165 --> 39:39.123
But I can't afford that luxury right now.

39:42.171 --> 39:45.959
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
the Book of Rao.

39:49.095 --> 39:52.929
It was left here by Jor-El for me
to save this planet.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.466
That's what you and Dad raised me for.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.552
It's my destiny.

40:01.023 --> 40:05.266
Your father and I always trusted you
to do the right thing.

40:06.904 --> 40:09.316
It seemed easier then.

40:09.490 --> 40:13.574
But now, what you're up against...

40:20.376 --> 40:22.458
When I went to Washington...

40:22.628 --> 40:26.166
...I found there were forces working
against you.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.915
I wanted to protect you.

40:29.885 --> 40:32.547
But I couldn't do it as Martha Kent.

40:35.641 --> 40:38.007
So I became the Red Queen.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.476
CLARK:
The Book of Rao.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.578
Are you okay, Mom?

40:59.748 --> 41:01.579
It's just....

41:02.209 --> 41:06.794
I told myself the world needs Clark Kent
even more than I do.

41:06.964 --> 41:11.207
But the truth is,
I was so afraid of losing you.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.842
You'll never lose me. I'll always be here.

41:14.013 --> 41:16.129
You don't understand.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.723
The Book of Rao can be used
to transport the Kandorians...

41:19.894 --> 41:21.634
...to another plane of existence.

41:23.272 --> 41:24.853
That may be the answer we need.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.935
Clark...

41:27.109 --> 41:30.522
...if the Book of Rao is used
to send the Kandorians away...

41:30.696 --> 41:34.188
...all Kryptonians will be exiled
from Earth...

41:34.366 --> 41:36.573
...including you.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.236
