was the one you were looking at.

31:16.610 --> 31:18.115
-How do you know which one
I was looking at?

31:18.150 --> 31:20.051
-Because it moved.

31:22.418 --> 31:24.913
-Wow. You're good.

31:24.948 --> 31:27.751
-No, this particular one
is an ancient relic

31:27.786 --> 31:31.425
discovered in Mesopotamia.

31:31.460 --> 31:34.967
It's said to be a tool of
The Harbinger.

31:35.002 --> 31:40.005
The Harbinger is like a sign
or omen of things to come.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.238
In this particular myth,
the Harbinger

31:42.273 --> 31:45.274
is a traveler doomed to Hell

31:45.309 --> 31:48.343
unless he does
the devil's bidding.

31:48.378 --> 31:51.907
And with him...

31:51.942 --> 31:54.151
comes damnation.

31:54.186 --> 31:56.153
-For what purpose?

31:56.188 --> 31:58.089
-Try to get as many people
as possible

31:58.124 --> 32:02.159
to kill themselves
so he can claim their souls.

32:02.194 --> 32:04.755
-How do they get people
to kill themselves?

32:04.790 --> 32:06.658
-The serpent relic.

32:06.693 --> 32:09.199
It's pure evil, forged in Hell,

32:09.234 --> 32:12.202
and influences people
to commit suicide.

32:12.237 --> 32:14.699
The Harbinger's job
is to drop the relic

32:14.734 --> 32:16.833
within the vicinity
of the victims.

32:16.868 --> 32:19.770
-Why -- Why can't he just
kill the people?

32:19.805 --> 32:22.047
-He can, but just because
he kills them

32:22.082 --> 32:23.807
doesn't mean he gets them.

32:23.842 --> 32:28.317
Your only way to true damnation
is through suicide.

32:28.352 --> 32:31.815
And, uh, he'll stop at nothing
to get you there.

32:31.850 --> 32:35.159
-He, uh, can't just drop
the relic himself?

32:35.194 --> 32:38.624
Why does he need Harbingers?
-To cover more ground.

32:38.659 --> 32:40.890
He sends one Harbinger
to each town.

32:40.925 --> 32:42.397
But there are too many towns,

32:42.432 --> 32:44.366
so he's always looking
for more Harbingers.

32:44.401 --> 32:47.534
He uses leverage to get people
to sign the contracts,

32:47.569 --> 32:49.734
people who have done bad things

32:49.769 --> 32:52.242
or made bad deals,
what have you.

32:52.277 --> 32:55.509
If he can hold something
over your head,

32:55.544 --> 32:57.346
he's got you.

32:59.086 --> 33:01.152
-So these Harbingers --
they go around

33:01.187 --> 33:03.550
to all these different towns
to get as many people

33:03.585 --> 33:06.322
to off themselves as possible.

33:06.357 --> 33:08.225
And if they don't?

33:08.260 --> 33:09.721
-Hell if I know.

33:09.756 --> 33:10.920
-Wait a second. Wait a second.

33:10.955 --> 33:13.890
You have the tool
of the Harbinger,

33:13.925 --> 33:17.036
the serpent relic,
in your house.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.764
Why haven't you killed yourself?

33:25.871 --> 33:27.607
-You -- What --
You don't really believe

33:27.642 --> 33:29.378
all that malarkey, do you?

33:29.413 --> 33:32.711
I mean, I guess if a Catholic
commits suicide,

33:32.746 --> 33:35.043
going against God and all that,

33:35.078 --> 33:37.452
but then again,
to try to get me to believe

33:37.487 --> 33:39.256
that there's some dude
working for the devil

33:39.291 --> 33:42.226
who can make you kill yourself
using some little trinket?

33:42.261 --> 33:45.856

1:04:45.518 --> 1:04:48.486
I'll share my take with you."

1:04:48.521 --> 1:04:51.962
The cockroach said, "Sure,"
and went in with the fly.

1:04:53.691 --> 1:04:55.592
As soon as they were
in the door,

1:04:55.627 --> 1:04:58.727
a boot smashed the cockroach.

1:04:58.762 --> 1:05:00.971
The fly flew to the kitchen,

1:05:01.006 --> 1:05:02.896
grabbed a piece of rancid
meat out of the garbage,

1:05:02.931 --> 1:05:05.976
and flew to the door.

1:05:06.011 --> 1:05:10.178
But before he made it out
the door, it shut.

1:05:10.213 --> 1:05:12.510
The fly landed on the door,

1:05:12.545 --> 1:05:15.942
waiting for an opportunity
to escape.

1:05:15.977 --> 1:05:19.418
Then, smack!

1:05:19.453 --> 1:05:22.883
A fly swatter splatted the fly's
guts all over the door.

1:05:24.557 --> 1:05:28.427
-What's the point
of the story, honey?

1:05:28.462 --> 1:05:32.926
-It doesn't matter if you are
the cockroach or the fly.

1:05:32.961 --> 1:05:35.599
We all end up the same way.

1:05:39.506 --> 1:05:41.671
-Good night.

1:05:43.345 --> 1:05:46.577
-My baby.

1:05:52.321 --> 1:05:54.816
-Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Ho!

1:05:54.851 --> 1:05:57.192
-Oh, hey, Danny.
Look what I got.

1:05:57.227 --> 1:05:59.458
Ask and you shall receive.

1:05:59.493 --> 1:06:02.131
-Are you Snyder?
-Yes, sir.

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.694
-I'm Sam Watkins,
a code investigator.

1:06:04.729 --> 1:06:06.729
Your fence is not up to code,

1:06:06.764 --> 1:06:08.401
and your garage
is not up to code,

1:06:08.436 --> 1:06:10.568
and I have a city permit

1:06:10.603 --> 1:06:13.901
to inspect your house.

1:06:13.936 --> 1:06:16.838
-Oh, this is
such petty bullshit!

1:06:16.873 --> 1:06:19.049
-When it rains it pours.
Go ahead, guys.

1:06:19.084 --> 1:06:20.479
Search the premises.

1:06:20.514 --> 1:06:23.053
-Search the place.
You, too, for all I care.

1:06:23.088 --> 1:06:25.682
But, let's just call this
what it is -- a witch hunt!

1:06:25.717 --> 1:06:27.354
-Well, whatever you want.

1:06:27.389 --> 1:06:28.718
-What's the problem?

1:06:28.753 --> 1:06:30.753
-Repo. Pay your bills, man.

1:06:30.788 --> 1:06:33.855
-I'm current on my loan.
-Not my problem.

1:06:33.890 --> 1:06:36.660
-I knew you'd be behind
all this.

1:06:36.695 --> 1:06:38.332
-Oh, let's see what we got.

1:06:38.367 --> 1:06:41.269
-He's got one of those snake
sticks in his briefcase.

1:06:41.304 --> 1:06:43.403
-Daniel Snyder,
you're under arrest.

1:06:43.438 --> 1:06:45.031
You have the right
to remain silent.

1:06:45.066 --> 1:06:46.571
Anything you do and say
can be used against you

1:06:46.606 --> 1:06:48.210
in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney.

1:06:48.245 --> 1:06:50.938
-What's the charge?
-Murder.

1:06:50.973 --> 1:06:54.612
The murders of Irene Lester,
Harlan Lester, and Betty Goss.

1:06:54.647 --> 1:06:55.712
You got him?
-Yep.

1:06:55.747 --> 1:06:57.186
-Get him in the car.

I don't know how to say it,

1:09:03.072 --> 1:09:05.171
-Jesus. What is it?

1:09:11.014 --> 1:09:14.257
What, did you kill someone?

1:09:14.292 --> 1:09:16.589
-My background is in finance.

1:09:18.626 --> 1:09:21.231
I was approached by
a businessman with a proposal.

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:26.335
-If we're smart about it,

1:09:26.370 --> 1:09:30.735
the ROI for our investors
is above 1,000%.

1:09:30.770 --> 1:09:32.539
-We ran a Ponzi scheme
on Wall Street.

1:09:32.574 --> 1:09:35.410
We and our investors --
we made millions.

1:09:35.445 --> 1:09:37.104
I didn't know what a Ponzi was.

1:09:37.139 --> 1:09:39.414
I just knew that it was
beautiful, until it wasn't.

1:09:39.449 --> 1:09:40.877
And just like Bernie Madoff
said,

1:09:40.912 --> 1:09:42.780
it didn't start off
with bad intentions.

1:09:42.815 --> 1:09:45.519
But, as so often happens,
shit spiraled out of control.

1:09:45.554 --> 1:09:47.422
We couldn't pay back investors.

1:09:47.457 --> 1:09:50.183
We were screwed.
The investors were screwed.

1:09:50.218 --> 1:09:51.888
My partner and I
were heading for prison.

1:09:51.923 --> 1:09:54.957
Theresa and I knew it.

1:09:54.992 --> 1:09:58.895
One day, a man showed up
at our door.

1:09:58.930 --> 1:10:00.732
I don't want to go into detail
about how horrifying

1:10:00.767 --> 1:10:03.636
this particular individual is,
but he offered me a deal.

1:10:03.671 --> 1:10:06.067
-And mutually beneficial
to the both of us.

1:10:06.102 --> 1:10:08.135
-He said I could avoid
going to jail.

1:10:08.170 --> 1:10:11.105
He'd pay back all my investors
on one condition --

1:10:11.140 --> 1:10:13.206
I had to do a job for him.

1:10:13.241 --> 1:10:17.243
Do you remember telling me
the story of The Harbinger?

1:10:17.278 --> 1:10:18.981
-Y-Yeah.

1:10:19.016 --> 1:10:21.456
-How much do you believe it?

1:10:21.491 --> 1:10:24.888
-About as much as I believe
in Santa Claus. Why?

1:10:24.923 --> 1:10:27.924
-This man told me
if I did this job,

1:10:27.959 --> 1:10:30.256
my family would never be
in financial danger again.

1:10:30.291 --> 1:10:31.928
Now, the job is unspeakable.

1:10:31.963 --> 1:10:33.402
I couldn't bring myself
to do it,

1:10:33.437 --> 1:10:36.097
even if it meant
avoiding poverty and prison.

1:10:36.132 --> 1:10:38.264
When he realized this,

1:10:38.299 --> 1:10:42.103
he took my daughter's spirit
until the job is done.

1:10:44.008 --> 1:10:46.514
-Your daughter's spirit?

1:10:46.549 --> 1:10:49.451
-What if I were to tell you
Santa Claus is real?

1:10:53.985 --> 1:10:58.086
You -- Wh-- You're telling me
there's a Harbinger?

1:10:58.121 --> 1:11:00.660
-I'll tell you everything if
you are willing to hear me out.

1:11:00.695 --> 1:11:03.190
-Answer first. You're saying
there<i> is</i> a Harbinger.

1:11:03.225 --> 1:11:04.763
-I need to know

1:11:04.798 --> 1:11:06.996
-You first, or I'm walking
through that door.

1:11:07.031 --> 1:11:08.701
You're saying
there's a Harbinger.

1:11:08.736 --> 1:11:11.671
-No, John, I'm telling you
<i>I'm</i> The Harbinger.

1:11:11.706 --> 1:11:13.167
But I want out.

1:11:44.541 --> 1:11:46.673

uh, little booklets.

1:11:46.708 --> 1:11:49.203

1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:50.318
And here we go.

1:14:50.353 --> 1:14:56.027
In 1647, the first white
fur traders arrived here.

1:14:56.062 --> 1:14:58.667
The settlers were not
far behind.

1:14:58.702 --> 1:15:00.834
They did not understand
our ways,

1:15:00.869 --> 1:15:04.497
and we certainly
did not understand theirs.

1:15:04.532 --> 1:15:07.940
Along with them came
their illnesses, mythology,

1:15:07.975 --> 1:15:11.108
their deity, and, of course,

1:15:11.143 --> 1:15:13.209
their anti-deity.

1:15:15.653 --> 1:15:18.687
But Luc, or Lucifer
as he was called then,

1:15:18.722 --> 1:15:20.788
was new to this world as well.

1:15:23.628 --> 1:15:25.793
He didn't understand
that some land

1:15:25.828 --> 1:15:29.456
was our sacred burial ground.

1:15:29.491 --> 1:15:32.030
He had to learn the hard way.

1:15:32.065 --> 1:15:35.132
Because he knew he had no power
on our domain...

1:15:35.167 --> 1:15:38.102
-...over time he made a promise

1:15:38.137 --> 1:15:41.875
to leave our people alone,

1:15:41.910 --> 1:15:45.373
and he guaranteed it
with an official treaty ceremony

1:15:45.408 --> 1:15:48.079
taking place with him
on his land,

1:15:48.114 --> 1:15:50.950
and our people on ours.

1:15:50.985 --> 1:15:53.821
But naturally,
he broke his promise.

1:15:53.856 --> 1:15:56.252
Whenever one of us
ventured off our land,

1:15:56.287 --> 1:15:59.794
he took advantage.

1:15:59.829 --> 1:16:04.997
Through the years, Luc learned
where he had power,

1:16:05.032 --> 1:16:07.395
where he did not.

1:16:07.430 --> 1:16:11.168
Our people cursed him,
along with his followers

1:16:11.203 --> 1:16:13.742
and those who disturbed
our grounds.

1:16:13.777 --> 1:16:18.109
From then on, Luc dared not
cross the boundary.

1:16:18.144 --> 1:16:21.178
Although<i> he</i> learned
the lay of the land,

1:16:21.213 --> 1:16:23.917
the settlers did not.

1:16:23.952 --> 1:16:28.119
Time and time again,
and across generations,

1:16:28.154 --> 1:16:31.287
they buried their dead
on sacred ground.

1:16:31.322 --> 1:16:35.522
These souls could not be claimed
by Luc<i> or</i> God.

1:16:35.557 --> 1:16:37.964
Your people are right.

1:16:37.999 --> 1:16:40.197
They<i> are</i> cursed.

1:16:40.232 --> 1:16:42.771
Luc had quite
the silver tongue.

1:16:42.806 --> 1:16:45.807
He promised that
if they collected enough souls,

1:16:45.842 --> 1:16:48.139
he would lift the curse.

1:16:48.174 --> 1:16:51.604
But no matter how many souls
The Harbingers collect,

1:16:51.639 --> 1:16:55.311
it is never enough.

1:16:55.346 --> 1:16:57.016
He tricked 'em.

1:16:57.051 --> 1:16:59.612

for you,

1:16:59.647 --> 1:17:02.054

This is the dagger
made by your God.

1:17:13.496 --> 1:17:16.706
To resurrect her,
you must plunge the dagger

1:17:16.741 --> 1:17:18.741
deep into her chest.

1:17:18.776 --> 1:17:22.976
The evil will pour from her,
expelling the dagger.

1:17:23.011 --> 1:17:25.407

are restored,
