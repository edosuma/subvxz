WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:03.669
- Hey there, Boyle.
How was your weekend?

00:03.671 --> 00:05.471
- Well, actually I got
a little sick.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.473
- Oh, really?
I'm sorry to hear that, man.

00:07.475 --> 00:10.509
- Yeah, "bullets over
Broadway" was on TV.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.380
And I came down with a big ol'
Dianne Wiest infection.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:25.126 --> 00:26.325
Like "yeast."

00:47.048 --> 00:49.081
- So I'll coordinate with
the transit cops while you

00:49.083 --> 00:53.085
Follow up with the da's off...
Uh, can I help you,

00:53.087 --> 00:56.288
Captain Stentley?
- Oh, hey, uh, did you guys

00:56.290 --> 00:58.257
See a black backpack
sitting around anywhere?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.975
- I did not.
- No.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.692
- Aww, shoot, this is turning
out to be a real cluster-biff.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.062
- Why?
What's in the backpack?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.430
- Uh, just some evidence.
Do you guys know

01:04.432 --> 01:06.565
A drug dealer named Flaco?
- Oh, yeah, he's a big-time

01:06.567 --> 01:09.268
Supplier, consolidated half
the territory in Brooklyn.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.836
- Well, the bag belongs
to one of his runners,

01:10.838 --> 01:13.806
And it contains, like, a
football's worth of cocaine...

01:13.808 --> 01:15.774
I'm not good with sizes...
And a cell phone.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.126
- And you think that
the cell phone might

01:17.127 --> 01:18.477
Have intel that could
lead us to Flaco.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.846
- I do now.
That's a great theory!

01:20.848 --> 01:24.249
Whoa.
But the bag is missing, so...

01:24.251 --> 01:27.553
Hey, how big of a deal is it
if I, um, if I never find it?

01:27.555 --> 01:28.821
- I'd say it's a very...
- Ah-uh-uh-uh.

01:28.823 --> 01:32.491
Sugarcoat it for me.
- Okay, um, no biggie.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.860
- Ahh, that is great news.
Thank you so much.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.862
Hey, if you see
something, say something.

01:36.864 --> 01:40.499
Oh, that is catchy, huh?
It's like, I just

01:40.501 --> 01:42.301
Made up a hit song.
- Nope, very common

01:42.303 --> 01:44.470
Police expression.
- * If you see somethin' *

01:44.472 --> 01:48.207
* say somethin',
come on and party tonight *

01:50.211 --> 01:52.444
This is our chance.
If C.J. can't find that

01:52.446 --> 01:54.313
Evidence, he could be fired.
This could be our way

01:54.315 --> 01:57.783
Back onto the day shift.
* come on and party tonight *

01:57.785 --> 01:59.351
Wow!
It's actually

01:59.353 --> 02:01.887
A really catchy song.
- There's nothing to celebrate.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.873
Captain Stentley is going to
find that evidence

02:03.874 --> 02:05.858
Because we're gonna help him.
- What? No, this is our chance

02:05.860 --> 02:08.393
To undermine him.
Come on and party tonight.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.630
- Peralta, we're
police officers.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.266
We have a duty
to protect this city.

02:14.268 --> 02:18.704
We took an oath, a sacred oath.
What if those drugs end up

02:18.706 --> 02:21.773
On the street or a dangerous
criminal is set free

02:21.775 --> 02:24.143
Because of missing evidence?

02:24.145 --> 02:26.912
Okay, you know, you're trying
to say it's whatever

02:26.914 --> 02:29.448
Because you just...

02:29.450 --> 02:30.749
You're fumfering.
- Of course I'm fumfering.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.851
Fine, we'll find the bag.
Come on and party tonight.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.137
Damn it.

02:35.138 --> 02:37.422
- Hey, guys, department has
a new green initiative.

02:37.424 --> 02:40.659
We have to reduce
energy usage by 15%.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.628
That means no more
laminating, Santiago.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.397
- Oh, that's fine.
It's not the thing

02:45.399 --> 02:47.432
That gives me the most
pleasure in life.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.835
Interacting with other people,
that's what gets me going.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.371
- Scully, Hitchcock,
lose the chocolate fountain.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.773
- What are we supposed to
dip our strawberries in?

02:54.775 --> 02:57.309
Our nacho cheese fountain?
That's crazy.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.677
- Unless...

03:02.349 --> 03:06.285
Sarge, you beautiful bastard.
- Get rid of 'em.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.454
And, Gina, you can't run
that space heater 24/7 anymore.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.957
- Space heater?
Excuse me, this is

03:11.959 --> 03:16.395
A Fornax radiant comfort system,
and her name is Jacinta.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.297
- Okay, well,
Jacinta's gotta go.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.699
- He didn't mean that, darling.
- Seriously, turn off

03:20.701 --> 03:22.768
The space heater.
- No.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.836
- Do it, now. That's an order.
- Yeah, well, you don't wanna

03:24.838 --> 03:27.806
Start a battle of the wills
with Gina Linetti because

03:27.808 --> 03:30.475
You will emerge from that battle
a broken man.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.877
Not to brag,
but I was name-checked

03:31.879 --> 03:34.746
In my kindergarten teacher's
suicide note.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.281
- Oh, my god.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.917
- Any luck finding
the missing backpack?

03:38.919 --> 03:41.687
- No, but I did find C.J.'s
wallet, badge, and gun

03:41.689 --> 03:42.955
On top of the
toilet paper dispenser.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.556
I'm assuming he doesn't
know they're missing.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.691
- Mm.
- Why are you helping

03:45.693 --> 03:47.209
This guy, sir?
He's the opposite of

03:47.210 --> 03:48.726
Everything you stand for.
His favorite expression

03:48.729 --> 03:50.495
Is "that's gonna leave a mark."

03:53.267 --> 03:54.450
And he doesn't even
use it right.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.634
- Whoo, that soup is good.
That's gonna leave a mark.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.236
- What?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.837
- Well, he's not our best,
but I won't be part of

03:58.839 --> 04:00.973
Any sneaky subterfuge
designed to undermine him.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.808
- You think you're so great
just 'cause you always do

04:02.810 --> 04:04.576
What's good and right.
Well, I've got news

04:04.578 --> 04:07.512
- Ya boring.
- You know who else

04:07.514 --> 04:10.549
Was called "boring"?
Andreas Marggraf.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.284
And you know what he did?
- He discovered zinc,

04:12.286 --> 04:13.885
Because you've used that one on
me before because,

04:13.887 --> 04:15.404
Uh, ya boring.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.922
- Well, if I'm so boring,
how come I have a lead?

04:16.923 --> 04:19.757
Come take a look at this.
This is security footage

04:19.760 --> 04:21.360
From the day the backpack
went missing.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.761
11:00 a.m., the bag's
over a chair.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.896
Now let's fast forward
and see what happened to it.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.766
- Wait, that was two hours?
Where's C.J. during all this?

04:27.768 --> 04:31.637
<i>- * You have the right to
remain silent *</i>

04:31.639 --> 04:33.305
<i>* come on and party tonight *</i>
- * party tonight *

04:33.307 --> 04:36.341
The guy's got good hooks.
I mean, right?

04:36.343 --> 04:38.710
Wait, who's this guy?
Flaco must've sent someone

04:38.712 --> 04:40.846
To get the backpack,
and they just waltzed right in

04:40.848 --> 04:44.816
And took it out of the precinct.
Oh, C.J. is in so much trouble.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.351
You think that disapproving
glare works on me

04:46.353 --> 04:47.586
After all the times
I've seen it?

04:47.588 --> 04:50.689
Step it up, find something new,
ya boring.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.458
- 'Ello, me lady.
It's your matey lil'

04:53.460 --> 04:55.294
Charlie Boyle, innit, love?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.628
Ugh, it's 2:00 a.m.,

04:56.630 --> 04:58.664
And we're working.
How can you be so happy?

04:58.666 --> 05:01.466
Because I figured out the secret
of surviving the night shift.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.970
You see, this little piggy
went to the warehouse.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.939
This little piggy went with him.
This little piggy was like...

05:07.941 --> 05:09.908
- Stop, just stop
and say whatever

05:09.910 --> 05:12.778
You are saying another way.
- I found a 24 hour

05:12.780 --> 05:15.347
Foot massage parlor,
and it's amazing.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.683
It's the best experience
you've ever had.

05:17.685 --> 05:23.322
You're just like, mmm...

05:23.324 --> 05:25.557
ahh, what?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.059
- Wouldn't stop making
that noise, man.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.927
- Let me take you,
let me show you the greatest

05:28.929 --> 05:30.929
And only pleasure
of the night shift.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.965
- Pass, I'd rather die than have
a stranger touch my bare feet.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.600
- I'm telling you,
once they get get

05:35.602 --> 05:38.070
Their strong fingers
in your toe gaps,

05:38.072 --> 05:42.374
It's just mmm...

05:42.376 --> 05:44.776
uh, that's on me,

05:44.778 --> 05:45.944
Shouldn't have
had my eyes closed.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.580
Hey, C.J., you upset

05:48.582 --> 05:50.916
About something, man?
Maybe something in your career?

05:50.918 --> 05:53.885
- Yeah, I told the brass
that I lost the bag

05:53.887 --> 05:55.887
And I screwed up
the whole Flaco case,

05:55.889 --> 05:57.723
And you were wrong,
it was a biggie.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.124
- Yeah, well, you told me
to sugarcoat it.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.526
- And whose fault it that, Jake?
- Yours.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.563
- I know.
- Okay, so what happened?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.565
I mean, they couldn't have
fired you, right?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.033
That'd be crazy.
I mean, they could,

06:08.035 --> 06:10.035
For sure, they had every
reason to, but did they?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.504
Did they fire you?
- Worse.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.539
They're pulling my transfer.
- What transfer, what now?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.509
- Oh, I've just been feeling
overwhelmed with this job,

06:17.511 --> 06:18.643
And I don't know
if you've noticed,

06:18.645 --> 06:20.896
But I'm a little
in over my head.

06:20.897 --> 06:23.148
- Completely unqualified, yeah.
- It is so cool that you get me.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.683
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I heard that they

06:24.685 --> 06:27.052
Were hiring a head administrator
at the police academy,

06:27.054 --> 06:28.920
So I put in for it.
- Wait, you wanna

06:28.922 --> 06:30.822
Train other officers?
- Well, the nine years

06:30.824 --> 06:33.125
At the academy were some of
the best years of my life.

06:33.127 --> 06:35.861
- That's a six-month program.
- Sure, for a lot of people.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.463
Anyway, they said that
the job was mine,

06:38.465 --> 06:40.966
And now they're pissed,
so it looks like

06:40.968 --> 06:43.835
I'm stuck here forever.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.771
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.506
All is not lost.
We can still fix this.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.141
So, sure, maybe you can't
get back the backpack,

06:49.143 --> 06:51.176
But you could do
something even better.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.745
Like, what if you
single-handedly

06:53.747 --> 06:56.615
Figure out who Flaco is and
then you take him down.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.784
- Oh, come on, Jake.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.653
I'll just screw it up
like I screw up everything else.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.572
- No, you won't,
because I will be there

07:03.573 --> 07:05.490
To help you, but don't worry,
you'll still get all the credit.

07:05.492 --> 07:08.560
Listen to me, C.J., we're gonna
get you the hell out of here.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.529
- Are you sugarcoating
this for me?

07:10.531 --> 07:11.863
- I most certainly am not.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.466
- Whoo, that's gonna
leave a mark.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.801
- Ahh.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.704
- So, captain, I've been
thinking about this whole

07:19.706 --> 07:22.908
Missing backpack thing,
and what if we find Flaco

07:22.910 --> 07:24.943
And take him down?
- Oh, are you trying to solve

07:24.945 --> 07:26.611
C.J.'s case behind his back
to embarrass him?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.114
- No, not at all.
In fact, I think C.J.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.883
Should come along.
I just realized how important

07:31.885 --> 07:34.619
My duty as a police officer
is to me, you know?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.556
The sacred oath I took.
Your speech really inspired me.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.890
- Well, it was one of
my better ones.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.625
Felt really good
as I was saying it.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.828
- Yeah.
- So what's the plan, son?

07:42.830 --> 07:45.464
- Well, dad, we don't know
where Flaco is, but I have

07:45.466 --> 07:47.999
A C.I. who says he's got an
agreement with Marco Severino.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.635
- So you think we should pose
as drug dealers looking for

07:50.637 --> 07:52.938
A new heroin supplier
and get Severino

07:52.940 --> 07:54.673
To hook us up with Flaco.
And you think

07:54.675 --> 07:56.875
C.J. can handle this mission.
- I know he's inexperienced,

07:56.877 --> 07:57.976
But he's a creative guy.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.611
I think he'd be great
undercover.

07:59.613 --> 08:04.616
- Okay, muchachos, let's roll up
on these muchachos.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.152
- Great start, and I love
your double use of "muchachos."

08:07.154 --> 08:09.855
- Hey, it's C.J.,
by the way.

08:09.857 --> 08:14.726
Oooh, that's a nice lam job.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.695
This one goes on the blog.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.898
- Hey, sarge, what up, bro?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.867
- "What up, bro?"
you're laminating

08:21.869 --> 08:23.835
In here, aren't you?
- I'm sorry.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.136
I just love it so much.

08:25.138 --> 08:28.039
- It's okay, I'm used to it.
No one listens to me.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.142
I'm a lousy sergeant.
- What? No, don't say that.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.845
Why would you say that?
- If I tell you something,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.614
You promise not to
tell anyone else?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.582
- Of course.
- You know how I took

08:37.583 --> 08:39.251
The lieutenant's exam last week?
- Uh-huh.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.019
- I just found out
I didn't pass.

08:41.020 --> 08:45.056
- Oh, no, but you shouldn't
feel bad, only like 10%

08:45.058 --> 08:46.625
Of people pass on the first try.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.159
- I know, and I'm all exhausted

08:48.161 --> 08:50.662
Because of the night shift,
plus my bathroom break

08:50.664 --> 08:52.998
During the test took a little
longer than anticipated.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
- May I use the restroom,
please?

08:55.002 --> 08:58.203
Uh-oh, nothing to see here.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.939
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Little desk.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.743
- That's why they say
"it's test time, so diaper up."

09:04.745 --> 09:06.361
They say that,
I've never said that.

09:06.362 --> 09:07.978
I've never worn a diaper during
test. Who would wear

09:07.981 --> 09:09.681
A diaper during a test?
That's ridiculous, I mean...

09:09.683 --> 09:12.851
- Santiago.
- Sorry, look, don't give up

09:12.853 --> 09:15.220
On the green initiative.
You're a great sergeant.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.988
You'll get everyone on board.
- Not Gina.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.725
- Yes, Gina. You can handle her.
You can do this.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.928
Sarge, it's test time.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.896
- Diaper up.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.232
- Thank you for coming along
with me on this manhunt.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.034
I needed your help.
- No problem,

09:29.036 --> 09:30.936
Who are we looking for?
- He's a one-armed smuggler

09:30.938 --> 09:33.338
From the dunes of Tunisia.
He goes by the name

09:33.340 --> 09:35.874
Of señor riff raff.
- You're taking me

09:35.876 --> 09:37.742
To that foot massage place.
- I am taking you

09:37.744 --> 09:40.045
To the foot massage place.
I made that whole thing up.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.613
- Shocking.
- Look, the night shift

09:41.615 --> 09:43.281
Hasn't been easy on any of us.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.916
Let me make it slightly better

09:44.918 --> 09:46.318
By paying a
strong-handed woman

09:46.320 --> 09:49.020
To literally milk
the stress from your feet.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.122
Just shut up, I'll do it once.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.791
Yes!
- As long as you promise

09:52.793 --> 09:55.360
To never ever talk about
foot milk again.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.263
- Deal, you're gonna love it.
- I guarantee you, I won't.

09:58.265 --> 10:02.067
Mmm.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.836
- All right, that's
Severino's restaurant.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.672
My C.I. says he's in there.
- Whoo, I'm pumped. I'm ready.

10:07.674 --> 10:10.241
- Um, just out of curiosity,
how... how scared are you guys?

10:10.243 --> 10:13.311
- Not at all. How about you?
- I'm terrified,

10:13.313 --> 10:15.080
But, you know,
I just keep telling myself,

10:15.081 --> 10:16.848
Worst comes to worst, just
start shooting things, you know?

10:16.850 --> 10:18.650
- I think it might be better
if you stayed in the van.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.918
- Wait, are you
trying to sideline me?

10:19.920 --> 10:21.119
- Yes.
- Oh, thank god.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.054
But just because you're

10:23.056 --> 10:24.222
In the van doesn't mean
you're not an important

10:24.224 --> 10:25.857
Part of the mission.
Your job will be

10:25.859 --> 10:27.426
To keep an eye on
the restaurant.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.994
And, if anybody suspicious
walks in, you just...

10:28.996 --> 10:30.362
- Run everybody over
with the van and then

10:30.364 --> 10:31.863
Back up if they're still moving.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.515
- Don't try and guess
where I'm going with it.

10:33.516 --> 10:35.166
You keep an eye on the door.
If anyone suspicious walks in,

10:35.168 --> 10:37.135
Let us know in our ear pieces.
- Oh, I could

10:37.137 --> 10:38.937
Do that, absolutely.
You know, actually I saw

10:38.939 --> 10:41.906
Those ear pieces on "Ellen."
one time, Justin Bieber was on,

10:41.908 --> 10:44.142
And he was supposed to be, like,
a security guard, only...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.011
- C.J., I'm loving the story,
but we gotta go in.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.212
- I'll finish later.
- TBC.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.082
- Thanks for hand-laminating,
Santiago.

10:51.084 --> 10:56.154
- Of course, if you ask me,
saving energy is trending.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.290
Oh, Gina, didn't see you there.
- Gina, did you shut off

10:59.292 --> 11:02.260
Your space heater yet?
- Space heater...

11:02.262 --> 11:04.295
Doesn't ring any bells.
- Jacinta.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.997
- Oh, no, she's still
going strong.

11:05.999 --> 11:10.201
- I will take that thing away
from you by force, if necessary.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.371
- Well, come and get it.
- Seriously?

11:13.373 --> 11:16.808
The heater's under your skirt?
- Maybe. You can't prove that.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.977
- Yeah, I can.
There's a cord running under it,

11:18.979 --> 11:22.814
And I think you may be on fire.
- Mm, so?

11:22.816 --> 11:26.017
- What do you mean "so"?
- I'm not giving up Jacinta.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.821
- You are on fire, Gina.
You do not have the upper hand

11:29.823 --> 11:33.191
In this situation.
- I always have the upper hand.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.460
- Not when there's flames
shooting out of your butt!

11:35.462 --> 11:38.863
- Especially when there's flames
shooting out of my butt.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.339
- Damn it.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.312
How the hell
did I lose that one?

11:54.314 --> 11:57.248
- Hey, you Severino?
- Who wants to know?

11:57.250 --> 11:59.884
- I'm cal, this is billy.
We used to buy from Rosario,

11:59.886 --> 12:01.486
But he got busted by the feds,
and we're looking for

12:01.488 --> 12:03.755
A new hookup.
- Guys, we got company.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.924
There's a lady with a dog,
and a man with a ponytail.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.827
Another lady with a dog,
two dogs back to back, guys.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.895
<i>Is that fishy?</i>
- I knew Rosario.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.897
<i>- Seems fishy to me...</i>
- So how's come...

12:12.898 --> 12:14.898
<i>- There's a lot of dogs out...</i>
- I never heard of you?

12:14.901 --> 12:16.345
- Well, you can ask
Rosario's guys about us.

12:16.346 --> 12:17.790
<i>- They're right
on top of each other.</i>

12:17.791 --> 12:19.235
If you think it's weird, just
cough once for yes,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.106
Twice for no.
- I didn't come here

12:21.107 --> 12:22.974
To be accused of something.
We can buy from somebody else.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.409
<i>- Jake, I need an answer,
why is nobody coughing?</i>

12:24.411 --> 12:26.311
Hold up, I got a right to know

12:26.313 --> 12:28.246
Who I might be in business with.
- I need an answer on

12:28.248 --> 12:30.482
The dog thing, is it weird?
Can somebody cough?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.019
<i>- Whose cough was that?
Was that you, Jake?</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:35.787
<i>If it was you, cough twice,
if it was somebody else,</i>

12:35.789 --> 12:37.923
<i>Cough three times.</i>

12:37.924 --> 12:40.058
Sorry, bad allergy day,
pollen count is off the charts.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.961
- Pollen count, oh, man, how
do you come up with that stuff?

12:42.963 --> 12:45.096
- So what's your territory?
- But that's why you guys are

12:45.098 --> 12:47.031
In there, and I'm out here.
- We don't sell on the streets.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.700
We have loyal buyers
that come to us.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.368
- On the mic, you know...
- And we need quality product,

12:50.369 --> 12:52.036
Our customers are discerning.
- Check one, check two, check,

12:52.038 --> 12:54.939
Check, DJ C.J. on the mic.
- I got a guy that could get

12:54.941 --> 12:57.075
You the best dope in the city.
<i>- You know, I actually did DJ</i>

12:57.077 --> 12:58.610
<i>My sister's wedding.</i>
- But it ain't gonna be cheap.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.144
- It did not turn out well.
Apparently, there's such a thing

13:00.147 --> 13:02.247
As too much smash mouth.
- I'm sorry, you think we wanna

13:02.249 --> 13:03.848
Deal with complete strangers?
- God, sometimes I look at my

13:03.850 --> 13:05.116
Sister, and I'm like...
- I mean, we gotta

13:05.118 --> 13:06.518
Cover our own asses.
- She's got two kids,

13:06.520 --> 13:08.186
Beautiful house, and I'm like...
- How do we know

13:08.188 --> 13:09.788
This guy's even legit?
- C.J., what have you

13:09.790 --> 13:10.855
Done with your life?
- Shut up!

13:10.857 --> 13:11.856
- Stop talking!
- Ahh!

13:11.858 --> 13:12.857
- Shut up, now!
- Oh, my god.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.175
- Shut up, C.J.

13:14.176 --> 13:15.492
- Oh, whoa, whoa,
what are you, cops?

13:15.493 --> 13:16.809
- Yes, obviously we're cops.
Put your hands up.

13:16.810 --> 13:18.126
- Whoa, who said we were cops?
We haven't gotten any

13:18.131 --> 13:20.999
Information we needed yet.
Jake, you're blowing it, man.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.001
- Stop talking!

13:26.006 --> 13:28.006
- Crime scene investigators
combed every inch

13:28.008 --> 13:29.524
Of Severino's restaurant,
no drugs.

13:29.525 --> 13:31.041
- Well, we can't hold him much
longer, and he's not talking.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.077
The interrogation
did not exactly go well.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.412
You're gonna tell us
who Flaco is, and you're

13:34.414 --> 13:36.247
Gonna tell us right now.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.583
- Oh, that was crazy.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.218
- Well, there's one
bit of good news.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.453
The last call on Severino's
phone was to a contact

13:42.455 --> 13:44.522
We believe to be Flaco.
We've tracked his location

13:44.524 --> 13:47.158
To a warehouse by the water.
We're gonna storm the place.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.094
- Great, I'll go get C.J.
- Why? Why are you

13:50.096 --> 13:52.063
So determined to make
him a part of this?

13:52.065 --> 13:54.098
- No reason.
- If you actually cared

13:54.100 --> 13:56.067
About your sacred oath,
you'd see that he's

13:56.069 --> 13:58.136
A risk to the case.

13:58.138 --> 14:02.607
- Oh, my speech didn't actually
inspire you, did it?

14:02.609 --> 14:05.176
- Ugh, all right,
here's the truth.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.445
If we catch Flaco,
and C.J. gets credit for it,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.981
He's gonna transfer
out of the nine-nine.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.316
- That's what this is all about?
You're still trying

14:11.318 --> 14:13.184
To undermine the man?
- What? No!

14:13.186 --> 14:15.253
The opposite, if anything.
I want to see him succeed.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.956
I'm trying to overmine him.
- Oh, you know I hate it

14:17.958 --> 14:19.524
When you make up words, Peralta.
- Are you still mad at me

14:19.526 --> 14:21.159
For saying "snaccident"?
- Yes, very.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.327
- Please, just
let him come along.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.328
- No.
- Just so his name

14:23.330 --> 14:24.562
Is on the arrest report.
- No.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.197
- I'll put him
in a car a block away.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.368
- Fine.
At least tell me what it was

14:30.370 --> 14:32.103
About my speech that
didn't work for you.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.938
- Oh, man, if I had to

14:33.940 --> 14:35.940
Boil it down to one thing
and really pinpoint it,

14:35.942 --> 14:38.109
I guess I would just
say it's, uh, ya boring.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.144
But still
let him come? Great.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.547
What is all this?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.450
- Oh, hey, sarge.
I'm growing tropical plants now

14:45.452 --> 14:48.219
In the warmth
of my three space heaters.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.121
It's getting a little hot
though, wouldn't you say?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.890
Ugh, oh, yeah.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.059
Probably also turn on my
portable air conditioning unit.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.194
Boop.
- You're not gonna

14:56.196 --> 14:59.430
Beat me, Gina.
This is my last stand.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.601
- My whole life is last stands.
- Gina, can I talk to you

15:03.603 --> 15:05.136
For a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.073
Let me guess, you and Jake
are having problems;

15:09.075 --> 15:10.308
You want me to
teach you how to kiss?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.243
- What? No, stop that.
- Oh.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.112
- I know how I kiss,
I've read books.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.914
This is about terry.
You can't tell

15:15.916 --> 15:17.916
Anyone else this, but...
- he failed his

15:17.918 --> 15:19.450
Lieutenant's exam.
- How do you know that?

15:19.452 --> 15:21.052
- Let's just say my little birds

15:21.054 --> 15:23.521
Are everywhere
collecting whispers.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.323
He left the letter
on his desk, and I read it.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.458
- Okay, but if you know
he's depressed, then why

15:27.460 --> 15:29.127
Are you being so hard on him?
- Don't worry,

15:29.129 --> 15:31.262
I got this.
Just clear the lane

15:31.264 --> 15:35.233
And let Gina do her thing.
- What? Ugh.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.069
Gina? You locked me in.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.071
- Going to lunch.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.573
- Gina, you know
I'm very claustrophobic.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.443
- Everybody ready?
Where's C.J.?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.012
- Parked a block away
on Winthrop, as promised.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.213
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.015
I downloaded an app
on his phone that makes

15:51.017 --> 15:53.351
Your words sound like burps.
- Smart, really smart.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.219
- Yeah.
- Here we go, on three,

15:55.221 --> 15:58.222
Two, one.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.159
- NYPD, on the ground.
- On the ground!

16:01.161 --> 16:04.228
- Flaco, run!
- That's Flaco.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.735
It's locked, go back.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.548
- Oh, sorry.
- C.J., that's Flaco.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.083
You got him.
- Yeah!

16:25.085 --> 16:27.085
- He's out cold,
how'd you do it?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.753
- No, no, wait.
Let me guess.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.121
- You opened your
car door into him.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.322
- Yep.
- He never saw it coming.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.523
- Yep.
- And neither did you.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.092
It was a total accident;
you were getting out

16:34.094 --> 16:35.660
Of your car to go pee.
- No!

16:35.662 --> 16:37.495
There was a spider in the car,
and I panicked.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.130
- Damn it, how did I
not guess that?

16:39.132 --> 16:41.132
- You gotta see this spider.
It's gigantic.

16:41.134 --> 16:44.135
Charles, this is amazing.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.704
- I know, when's the last time
you cried like that?

16:46.706 --> 16:49.040
- Huh? You cried?
- Damn right, I did.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.043
- Oh, guess we gotta get back
to the nine-nine.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.545
- Let's not be hasty.
Neither of us have any

16:54.547 --> 16:59.417
Open cases right now,
so should we tell the ladies

16:59.419 --> 17:01.519
We're ready for round two?
- Let's do it,

17:01.521 --> 17:04.388
You insatiable little minx.
- I'll go get 'em.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.490
- Mmm.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.730
- Charles, this place
is a front,

17:12.732 --> 17:14.665
Money laundering or something.
- We gotta get out

17:14.666 --> 17:16.099
Of here right now.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.602
- I just got off the phone

17:17.603 --> 17:19.103
With one police plaza.
They're thrilled.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.071
Captain Stentley,
you got your transfer.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.106
- Whoo!
- I'm not transferring.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.641
- What, why?
- The whole reason

17:23.643 --> 17:25.175
I wanted to transfer
in the first place

17:25.178 --> 17:27.244
Is because I didn't feel like
I could do this job,

17:27.247 --> 17:30.314
But the mission tonight,
me taking down Flaco...

17:30.316 --> 17:32.183
- More the door than you.
- It just showed me

17:32.185 --> 17:34.752
That I can do this,
and now I feel like

17:34.754 --> 17:35.820
I really do belong here.

17:35.822 --> 17:39.190
So thank you, guys, for...

17:39.192 --> 17:40.758
For making me
believe in myself again.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.195
- Oh.
- Come here.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.329
- That's gonna leave a mark.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.366
- I can't believe this.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.168
Not only are we still
stuck on the night shift,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.336
But now we have to
watch C.J. get a medal.

17:52.338 --> 17:54.605
Why are there so many reporters?
Even "the times" is here.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.175
- Wait, really?
Who'd they send?

17:57.177 --> 18:00.545
Wilson, Palmer, Schneier,
Levine, rogers, Tyler, baker,

18:00.547 --> 18:03.147
Correal, Bromwich,
Robbins, Schmidt?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.249
- Stop saying reporters' names.
How do you know so many names?

18:05.251 --> 18:07.285
- They're the only real
rock stars we have left.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.738
- Okay.
- Hello, we're here today

18:09.739 --> 18:12.190
To honor captain Jason Stentley,
who single-handedly brought down

18:12.192 --> 18:13.825
A major drug ring.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.827
And so it is my pleasure
to bestow upon him

18:15.829 --> 18:18.396
The medal of honor.
Captain Stentley.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.798
- Oh, bestow me, baby.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.867
Ahh, wow,

18:22.869 --> 18:25.436
That's a lot of people.
Uh...

18:25.438 --> 18:28.106
Baba booey, cornholio.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.810
That's it for my prepared
remarks.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.228
Any questions?

18:34.229 --> 18:35.645
- Will taking down
one drug dealer make

18:35.648 --> 18:37.548
A big difference in the
overall level of drugs

18:37.550 --> 18:39.584
Moving into the city?
- No idea, next?

18:39.586 --> 18:40.818
- What's your philosophy
for dealing with

18:40.820 --> 18:42.553
International narcotic
supply chains?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.255
- Didn't understand
the question, next.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.624
- Why was Flaco targeted
for this operation?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.293
- Okay, there's a question
I can answer.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.598
- Well, it all started because
I lost a huge bag of cocaine,

18:53.600 --> 18:55.600
So I totally biffed it,
you know, but...

18:55.602 --> 18:57.869
- Thank you, thank you, captain.
- Oh, oh.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.137
- That... that is... That's plenty.
- That was a train wreck.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.240
- Yes, he never should have been
put in that position.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.675
Whoever recommended him
for the medal and called

19:04.677 --> 19:08.379
All those reporters
really messed up.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.448
- Wait, what are you saying?
- Oh, nothing.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.819
It just seems as if C.J.
has been... overmined.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.121
- You did this?
- I did.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.422
- And you used my made-up word.
- I hated it, "overmined."

19:19.425 --> 19:21.626
What have I become?
Was this whole thing

19:21.628 --> 19:24.195
Even worth it?
- It was no snaccident.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.866
- So the foot massage place
reported $7 million

19:28.868 --> 19:30.501
In profit last year.
To make that much,

19:30.503 --> 19:33.838
They'd have to massage 100 feet
an hour, 24 hours a day,

19:33.840 --> 19:36.174
7 days a week
for the entire year.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.475
- Damn it, we have to
shut them down.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.911
- Wait.
Let's not be hasty about this.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.913
Let's think this through.
We wanna be smart about this.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.415
- Right, I mean, what if we
bust them tonight,

19:44.417 --> 19:46.617
And then tomorrow
I'm chasing a murderer,

19:46.619 --> 19:48.319
And I'm about to get him,
and my foot cramps up?

19:48.321 --> 19:49.820
- Due to lack of massaging.
- And then the murderer

19:49.822 --> 19:51.822
Gets away.
- Know who he kills next?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.291
The mayor.
- Oh, my god, the city

19:53.293 --> 19:54.609
Has no mayor now.
- It's chaos.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.926
Rioting, looting,
panic in the streets.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.779
- They gotta call in
the national guard, there's

19:57.780 --> 19:59.630
Tanks rolling down 5th avenue,
declaring martial law.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.532
- It's insane.
All because we shut down

20:01.533 --> 20:03.433
The foot massage place...
- That was doing god's work.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.269
What were we thinking.
- So it's agreed:

20:05.271 --> 20:07.805
We let them stay open
for the sake of the city.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.373
- For the sake of the city.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.777
- We have to do
our stupid jobs, don't we?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.346
- Yeah, let me get
my stupid gun.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.448
- NYPD, get down on the
comfortable matted floor.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.983
- Put your magical hands
where we can see them.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.985
- You're under arrest for
ruining something perfect.

20:20.987 --> 20:21.986
- And money laundering.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.387
- Yes, money laundering,
whatever.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.757
- Gina, I've been thinking
a lot about how you refuse

20:26.759 --> 20:28.626
To give up Jacinta.
- That's right.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.795
She's never leaving.
- I know, which is why

20:30.797 --> 20:32.730
I decided to do
the only fair thing.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.933
Space heaters for everyone.
- So what? That sounds great.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.970
- Everyone.
- Whoo-whee,

20:38.972 --> 20:41.772
It's toasty in here.
- You're gonna be

20:41.774 --> 20:43.307
Looking at that all night long.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.793
Whoop, I think he's

20:45.794 --> 20:48.278
About to eat a hoagie.
Is that mayonnaise or sweat?

20:48.281 --> 20:51.015
- Ugh, fine, I give up.
You can take Jacinta.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.950
- Really? And the other
two space heaters, too?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.952
- All of them, you win.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.622
- I win?
I won.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.924
Amy, I won!
- You did it, sarge.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.477
You're gonna get
our power usage down.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.029
- I don't care about that crap.
I took down Gina Linetti.

21:05.031 --> 21:09.267
I did the impossible.
Terry is back on top.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.436
Diaper up! What!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

21:12.438 --> 21:15.706
Captain Jason Stentley has been
transferred from active duty

21:15.708 --> 21:17.942
Effective immediately.
Captain Raymond Holt

21:17.944 --> 21:21.612
Will be taking his place,
and, yes, he's taking

21:21.614 --> 21:22.847
All of us with him.
- You mean...

21:22.849 --> 21:25.349
- Yes, Amy.
We're back on the day shift!

21:25.351 --> 21:27.852
- Nine-nine!
- Nine-nine!

21:27.854 --> 21:29.920
- * Come on and party tonight! *

21:29.922 --> 21:31.389
<i>- Not a doctor.
- Shh.</i>
