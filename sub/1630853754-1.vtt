Will you write to me
every week as well?

a regular correspondence.

and Countess Amberton.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.056
Of course.

14:16.090 --> 14:17.891
How strange.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.427
I do wonder how
one encourages sentiment
without dancing.

14:20.461 --> 14:23.364
Malcolm.
Lord Cassidy,
Lady Amberton.

14:23.397 --> 14:26.133
Hello. How do you do?
How do you do?
Now, excuse us.

14:28.001 --> 14:32.607
Uh, Malcolm,
you are acquiring
quite the reputation.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.309
Is that so?
Yes, indeed.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.911
They are calling you
a trifler...
[laughs]

14:37.945 --> 14:42.015
...a breaker of hearts,
a destroyer
of young ladies' dreams.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.018
You're joking.
No.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.120
What nonsense.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.356
Well, perhaps
the gossips are correct.

14:51.626 --> 14:56.029
You paid
very particular attention
to my cousin Julia

14:56.063 --> 14:57.632
and now
have not been to call.

14:59.634 --> 15:02.202
I escorted your cousin
to the opera once.

15:02.236 --> 15:04.706
I did not pay her
"very particular
attentions."

15:04.739 --> 15:06.674
What actually occurred
is besides the point.

15:06.708 --> 15:10.344
It's what people say
that matters.

15:10.377 --> 15:14.114
And everyone is saying
that there must be
something wrong with Julia.

15:14.148 --> 15:16.618
I'm sorry that your cousin
has become the target
of gossips,

15:16.651 --> 15:20.020
but I do not plan to marry
a woman merely because
I took her to the opera.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.355
No, no one said
you had to.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.956
That is what they want,
isn't it?

15:24.526 --> 15:27.161
What are those dreams
I am accused of destroying?

15:27.194 --> 15:29.997
Dreams of marrying
the "catch of the season"
purely for my fortune.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.432
I will not have it.

15:31.465 --> 15:33.568
[croupier] Place your bets.
Do you want in?

15:33.601 --> 15:36.136
No, no. I have spent
all my money.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.608
[croupier]
Oh, excellent.

15:40.642 --> 15:42.342
Why not just choose
some girl

15:42.376 --> 15:44.311
and just make
an end of it?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.581
You know,
propagation of the species
and all that.

15:46.614 --> 15:48.583
Why do you think
I am here tonight?

15:48.616 --> 15:51.452
I am very anxious
to find a suitable bride.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.989
Then why not Julia?

15:56.023 --> 15:58.058
She's generally acknowledged
as a handsome woman.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.761
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

15:59.794 --> 16:02.630
She's handsome enough,
but she's not the one for me.

16:02.664 --> 16:05.365
No.
[croupier]
Place your bets.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.768
Why not?

16:06.801 --> 16:08.168
I don't know.
She--

16:09.571 --> 16:12.707
She flutters her eyelashes
far too much.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.176
Malcolm,
that's blinking.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.346
That--
That is your reason?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.583
No, that's
a pretty paltry reason.

16:21.616 --> 16:23.518
It was very distracting.

16:23.551 --> 16:25.352
Numerous times
throughout the evening,

16:25.385 --> 16:27.221
I thought she was going
to fall asleep.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.490
Don't look at me
like that.
Place your bets.

16:29.524 --> 16:32.594
It was not the only thing
that turned me off
Miss Thistlewaite.

16:32.627 --> 16:33.661
Here.

16:33.695 --> 16:35.329
Item four.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.532
"Converses in
a sensible fashion."

16:37.565 --> 16:40.602
My tailor's conversation
is far more scintillating
than your cousin's.

16:40.635 --> 16:44.171
I tried to engage her
in a discussion
about the Corn Laws,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.708
and she thought
it was a diet regimen.
It's your turn, sir.

16:46.741 --> 16:49.577
What is this?
Is this a list?
[croupier] Place your bets.

16:49.611 --> 16:50.545
Yes, it is.

16:52.547 --> 16:55.517
You have some sort of
list of qualifications
for a bride?

16:55.550 --> 16:57.417
Yes, I do. So?

16:57.451 --> 17:00.387
[croupier] Chance, sir.
You may roll again.
[scoffs]

17:00.420 --> 17:03.190
That is
damned arrogant of you.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.092
No wonder you cannot
settle upon anyone.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.627
You want them to meet
some catalog of requirements,

17:06.661 --> 17:08.630
like a...
Very well done, sir.

17:08.663 --> 17:11.298
...like a tandem horse
you're purchasing
for your curricle.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.300
Exactly.
Exactly that!

17:13.333 --> 17:15.569
I have specific requirements
when filling my stable.

17:15.603 --> 17:18.573
Why not even more
stringent requirements
when choosing a bride?

17:18.606 --> 17:20.440
A companion
I will see morning...
Shall we roll again, sir?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.476
...noon and night.

17:22.510 --> 17:25.178
Next thing you know,
you'll be putting her
through her paces

17:25.212 --> 17:26.748
or checking her teeth.

17:26.781 --> 17:29.316
-Disaster.
-I'll add that to the list.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.685
[croupier]
Bad luck, sir.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.319
One more?
No, I'm not drinking.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.387
One more.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.723
[chirping]

17:39.126 --> 17:41.663
She does not bite,
you know. [laughs]
[exclaims]

17:41.696 --> 17:45.232
You have the manners
of a Billingsgate fishwife!

17:45.265 --> 17:47.234
I would not know,

17:47.267 --> 17:50.437
as I do not keep
the low society
you do, Cousin.

17:52.272 --> 17:56.611
[sighs]
From my friend Selina.

17:58.312 --> 18:02.316
Evidently, the news
has reached Sussex.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.318
Tomorrow
the whole of England
will know.

18:06.621 --> 18:07.622
Did you...

18:08.890 --> 18:10.592
speak to Mr. Malcolm?

18:11.659 --> 18:12.660
I did.

18:14.696 --> 18:16.396
What did he say about me?

18:16.430 --> 18:19.834
Well, he agreed

18:19.867 --> 18:22.737
that you are
a handsome woman.

18:22.770 --> 18:25.272
Did he?
That is good news.

18:25.305 --> 18:29.142
But he has this list,
you see, and, um...

18:30.912 --> 18:33.881
Well, unfortunately,
you did not meet
the fourth qualification.

18:33.915 --> 18:36.751
I would have failed it myself
as I have no interest
in politics

18:36.784 --> 18:38.720
and have always found
the Corn Laws
particularly confusing.

18:38.753 --> 18:39.854
He has a list...

18:42.356 --> 18:43.691
of requirements

18:45.459 --> 18:46.293
for a bride?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.328
Yes.

18:48.362 --> 18:52.800
And I must say that
I did not care for the idea
at first myself,

18:52.834 --> 18:57.270
but then when
he explained it to me,
I could see his point.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.473
What if the girl has
some odd kick in her gallop?

18:59.507 --> 19:01.609
Charming!
Well, his brother,
the Viscount,

19:01.643 --> 19:04.579
was lured into a terrible match
and left miserable
as a consequence.

19:04.612 --> 19:06.814
I don't believe it.

19:06.848 --> 19:09.483
The arrogance!

19:09.517 --> 19:11.753
I would like to see
what is on this list.

19:13.688 --> 19:14.689
Cassie.

19:15.957 --> 19:18.325
Did you see it?

19:18.358 --> 19:19.359
No.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.864
-Yes.
-[groans]

19:22.897 --> 19:25.499
But it would do you no good.
No good at all.

19:25.533 --> 19:27.735
No one can live up
to these expectations.

19:27.769 --> 19:30.237
I mean, even if you'd passed
the Corn Laws test,

19:30.270 --> 19:32.874
your eyelashes,
they irritated him to no end.

19:33.908 --> 19:35.543
My eyelashes?

19:36.978 --> 19:40.247
Is the man deranged?
No, of course not.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.483
You just can't fool him
with those tricks you pull.

19:43.518 --> 19:44.819
He despises
flirtatious games.

19:45.787 --> 19:48.488
The unmitigated gall.

19:49.624 --> 19:50.892
What conceit!

19:52.560 --> 19:54.327
Is it rather warm
in here?

19:56.864 --> 20:00.267
Somehow I will see to it

20:00.300 --> 20:02.503
that the Honorable Mr. Malcolm

20:03.671 --> 20:06.373
receives exactly
what he deserves.

20:08.643 --> 20:10.611
He won't get away with this.

20:12.013 --> 20:13.213
Right.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.951
Right.
Well, I'd best be off.

20:16.984 --> 20:19.486
And you're
going to help me.

20:21.522 --> 20:22.489
No.

20:23.457 --> 20:25.225
Julia, absolutely not.

20:25.827 --> 20:26.928
Julia, no.

20:30.031 --> 20:31.866
Julia,
what are you doing?
[sighs]

20:35.335 --> 20:36.637
Julia, stop.

20:39.640 --> 20:43.711
My dearest Selina...

20:43.745 --> 20:44.444
[scoffs]

20:45.980 --> 20:48.716
<i>...thank you</i>
<i>for your kind correspondence</i>

20:48.750 --> 20:51.753
<i>in regards to</i>
<i>that vile caricature.</i>

20:51.786 --> 20:54.622
<i>I've been thinking that it would</i>
<i>cheer me up no end</i>

20:54.655 --> 20:57.959
<i>to see you after all this time.</i>

20:57.992 --> 21:00.962
<i>Will you come visit me in London</i>
<i>for what is left of the season?</i>

21:02.630 --> 21:05.533
<i>I promise you will be</i>
<i>well entertained.</i>

21:08.335 --> 21:10.071
Apparently,
she's from the country.

21:10.104 --> 21:12.774
Would you just be quiet
for once, John?

21:12.807 --> 21:13.741
Posture.

21:14.609 --> 21:16.043
[clears throat]

21:17.912 --> 21:19.013
[coach driver]
Steady.

21:19.046 --> 21:20.581
Whoa!

21:30.858 --> 21:32.026
Well.

21:32.927 --> 21:34.327
Selina!

21:34.361 --> 21:35.997
Julia!
[laughing]

21:37.430 --> 21:39.100
You made it!
I did!

21:39.133 --> 21:42.837
How long has it been?
My dear,
how you've blossomed!

21:42.870 --> 21:45.673
You look well yourself!
I'm so glad
you're here.

21:47.575 --> 21:49.944
You must be parched.
Come inside.
Yes.

21:49.977 --> 21:53.080
John, put Selina's bags
in her room immediately.

21:53.114 --> 21:56.551
My dear cousin,
Lord Cassidy,
is dying to meet you.

21:59.687 --> 22:03.124
So, tell us more
about how you've been
occupying your time

22:03.157 --> 22:05.392
in the charming countryside.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.528
It's such a different life
from here in town.

22:07.562 --> 22:10.097
Yes.
Well, as I mentioned
in my letters,

22:10.131 --> 22:13.935
I had been in Bath
serving as a companion
to the elderly Lady Ossory

22:13.968 --> 22:15.036
in her final years.

22:15.069 --> 22:17.004
Yes, Lady Ossory.

22:17.038 --> 22:18.606
How dreary for you.

22:18.639 --> 22:21.108
No, no. It was not
at all unpleasant,

22:21.142 --> 22:24.411
though I did long
for some companions
my own age.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.815
Bath has become
quite the destination
for septuagenarians.

22:27.849 --> 22:30.952
Oh, my dear,
I understand completely.

22:30.985 --> 22:33.921
I find foreigners
very tedious as well.

22:36.524 --> 22:38.458
Well, your letter came
in the nick of time

22:38.491 --> 22:40.061
as I've yet to find
another position.

22:42.630 --> 22:44.832
My dear Selina,

22:44.866 --> 22:47.702
if it is a position
that you're looking for,

22:47.735 --> 22:50.071
I may have
the very thing.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.839
[giggles]

22:51.873 --> 22:55.810
Well, "position"
may not be quite
the right word.

22:57.111 --> 23:00.848
It's more of
a project, a lark.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.619
You see,

23:04.652 --> 23:07.855
there is a gentleman,
a Mr. Malcolm,

23:07.889 --> 23:10.490
who is widely known
for his arrogance.

23:10.524 --> 23:12.827
Is he the one
in that awful caricature?

23:12.860 --> 23:14.394
The very same.

23:15.663 --> 23:18.532
[sighs]
As you may know,

23:18.566 --> 23:21.769
he paid me very public,
very pointed attentions

23:21.802 --> 23:24.572
and then humiliated me
by withdrawing his suit.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.874
Julia,
how dreadful for you.
Mmm.

23:26.908 --> 23:28.676
Uh, I--
I am so sorry.

23:29.677 --> 23:31.545
It was very unpleasant,

23:31.579 --> 23:33.114
especially when
I found out

23:33.147 --> 23:35.983
that he had
a list that
he judged me against

23:36.017 --> 23:37.652
and found me wanting.

23:37.685 --> 23:39.220
What sort of list?

23:39.253 --> 23:41.055
It is a list
of the qualifications

23:41.088 --> 23:42.690
he is looking for
in a bride.

23:42.723 --> 23:44.692
But he believes himself
to be so superior

23:44.725 --> 23:46.794
that his qualifications
are quite unreachable.

23:47.995 --> 23:51.032
I would love
for Mr. Malcolm

23:51.065 --> 23:53.768
to receive the comeuppance
he deserves,

23:55.069 --> 23:57.171
but I need
your assistance.

23:57.204 --> 23:59.974
My assistance?
Hmm?

24:04.912 --> 24:08.082
If we were
to present you

24:08.115 --> 24:11.218
as the perfect woman
that he is looking for,

24:11.252 --> 24:15.923
and then allow him
to discover that
you have a list,

24:15.957 --> 24:19.660
and he does not meet
the requirements
on your list,

24:19.694 --> 24:25.232
well, that would be
a perfect sort of
poetic justice.

24:31.005 --> 24:34.474
I don't know. It's--
It sounds rather...

24:35.643 --> 24:36.677
Mm-mmm.

24:36.711 --> 24:37.778
...devious.

24:37.812 --> 24:40.681
[scoffs] My dear Selina!

24:40.715 --> 24:43.718
Do not be
such a namby-pamby!

24:43.751 --> 24:46.153
I will not allow that man
to ruin one more reputation.

24:46.187 --> 24:49.557
But if he is as arrogant
and fastidious as you say,

24:49.590 --> 24:51.826
then how am I
to attract his attention?

24:51.859 --> 24:54.095
If Mr. Malcolm
was not captivated by you,

24:54.128 --> 24:56.897
then surely he will not
even look in my direction.

24:56.931 --> 24:58.833
Oh, Selina.

25:00.101 --> 25:02.603
What an astute observation.

25:03.771 --> 25:07.541
However,
even though your look

25:07.575 --> 25:10.011
is not fashionable
in the classical sense,

25:10.044 --> 25:14.315
you are more informed than I
or any other young lady
before you.

25:14.348 --> 25:17.551
You know
about the list.

25:17.585 --> 25:20.888
And with some tutelage
from my cousin and me...

25:20.921 --> 25:24.158
Mmm.
...you have a very good chance
of meeting the requirements.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.226
[chews, grunts]

25:26.861 --> 25:29.764
Your-- Your cousin
is going to instruct me

25:29.797 --> 25:33.200
on how to attract
a sophisticated gentleman
of particular tastes?

25:33.234 --> 25:34.301
Mmm.

25:34.335 --> 25:38.139
[chews, gags]

25:38.172 --> 25:40.007
Apparen-- Apparently, yes.

25:41.142 --> 25:43.611
I-I-I don't think I...

25:43.644 --> 25:45.312
My dear Selina.

25:47.615 --> 25:50.985
I do hope you'll agree
to help me.

25:51.018 --> 25:54.121
After all,
we've always looked out
for each other, have we not?

25:56.057 --> 25:57.291
Plus, it could be
rather fun.

26:03.664 --> 26:06.067
What is it exactly
that you want me to do?

26:06.100 --> 26:07.601
Oh!

26:10.004 --> 26:11.105
Thank you.

26:12.673 --> 26:13.841
[clears throat]

26:13.874 --> 26:15.609
Item number one:

26:15.643 --> 26:18.179
"Handsome of countenance
and figure."

26:22.950 --> 26:24.919
[humming]

26:27.021 --> 26:29.957
Oh.
That's lovely, Molly.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.125
Lower across
the bodice.

26:31.158 --> 26:32.993
Julia!

26:33.027 --> 26:36.831
[Julia] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>"Graceful and well mannered."</i>

26:36.864 --> 26:39.800
Look at me.
Back arched
just a little, Selina.

26:39.834 --> 26:41.702
We are having
the gown cut low.

26:41.735 --> 26:43.270
We don't want him
to miss the effect.

26:43.304 --> 26:45.172
Julia,
that's outrageous!

26:45.206 --> 26:47.007
And we are...

26:47.041 --> 26:48.709
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

26:48.742 --> 26:50.211
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

26:50.244 --> 26:53.781
Don't stop now.
You will trip Cassie.

26:53.814 --> 26:57.785
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
And fly like a bird!

26:57.818 --> 26:58.919
Spin out.
Pirouette.

26:58.953 --> 27:00.354
[Julia] <i>Number three:</i>

27:00.387 --> 27:03.257
<i>"Educates herself</i>
<i>by extensive reading."</i>

27:03.290 --> 27:07.795
[sighs]
Becoming a suitable bride
is quite burdensome.

27:07.828 --> 27:10.798
I almost feel as if
I'm being trained up
to become a wife.

27:10.831 --> 27:11.298
I know.

27:13.367 --> 27:16.704
God forbid someone decided
to enter a marriage
based on love.

27:16.737 --> 27:18.105
What a wonderful thing to say.

27:19.406 --> 27:23.377
You must exude
an elegance of mind,

27:23.410 --> 27:25.746
a knowledge
of the world,

27:25.779 --> 27:29.984
while still
retaining the naïveté
that men find so charming.

27:30.017 --> 27:32.753
-Do you know anything
about the Corn Laws?
-Of course I do.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.388
It's very important
that you do.

27:34.421 --> 27:36.423
I've brought you some tracts
on the subject.

27:36.457 --> 27:40.427
Do not waste too much time
on those tracts, Selina.

27:40.461 --> 27:44.231
A gentleman doesn't
like a lady to be more
intelligent than he is.

27:44.265 --> 27:48.002
A wife with a mind,
God forbid.

27:48.035 --> 27:51.772
And thinking too deeply
causes forehead furrows.

27:51.805 --> 27:54.975
It might be a good idea
if you meditated
on the ocean.

27:55.009 --> 27:57.011
I find when I think
of the sea...

27:58.513 --> 28:00.748
I'm less apt
to wrinkle my brow.

28:02.082 --> 28:03.951
Oh! I almost forgot.
No blinking.

28:03.984 --> 28:05.386
I beg your pardon?

28:05.419 --> 28:08.122
Malcolm doesn't like
flirtatious tricks.

28:08.155 --> 28:10.357
Well, Cassie,

28:10.391 --> 28:12.793
if you were paying
the least bit of attention,

28:12.826 --> 28:15.829
you would have realized
I already explained
to Selina

28:15.863 --> 28:18.899
that there should be
no artificiality
in her behavior

28:18.933 --> 28:22.136
when she pretends
an attraction
to Mr. Malcolm.

28:22.169 --> 28:25.072
That doesn't sound
anything at all
like what I said.

28:25.105 --> 28:29.343
Well, excuse me
for not using words
of fewer syllables.

28:29.376 --> 28:31.111
Oh.

28:31.145 --> 28:33.747
Well, if you're
so bloody smart,
Miss Hoity-Toity,

28:33.781 --> 28:36.183
how come you couldn't pass
Malcolm's little test?

28:36.217 --> 28:38.152
What is this now,
your fourth season?

28:38.185 --> 28:39.486
Maybe if you'd
warned me!

28:39.521 --> 28:41.322
I didn't want anything
to do with this.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.057
I don't want anything
to do with you!

28:43.090 --> 28:44.325
That's not--
Enough!

28:47.228 --> 28:50.164
I believe I have an idea
of what Mr. Malcolm
is looking for.

28:51.999 --> 28:55.202
Now, what plan do you have
for us to meet?

28:57.438 --> 28:59.907
[Julia]
Selina, you are blending in.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.976
[guests chattering]

29:02.009 --> 29:03.277
Now you must hide.

29:05.547 --> 29:08.249
A job masterfully done,
I'd say.

29:08.282 --> 29:09.984
Julia,
I'm a little nervous.

29:10.017 --> 29:12.119
Do not worry.
Wait in here.

29:13.454 --> 29:14.522
Hmm?

29:15.590 --> 29:17.191
I shall return.

29:25.165 --> 29:27.434
[guests chattering]
[music playing]

29:36.010 --> 29:38.078
I should have stayed
in Sussex after all.

29:42.883 --> 29:44.018
I beg your pardon?

29:45.486 --> 29:49.156
Uh, I'm-- I am sorry
to disturb you, sir.

29:49.189 --> 29:51.225
I thought this room
to be unoccupied.

29:54.228 --> 29:55.462
'Tis no matter.

29:57.231 --> 29:59.033
Um, hiding from
the dancing?

30:01.068 --> 30:03.270
Uh, something like that.
I was, um...

30:06.273 --> 30:08.275
reflecting on
the futility of a dream.

30:11.145 --> 30:13.881
Is any dream futile?

30:16.250 --> 30:19.554
It gives us hope,
and hope is a good thing.

30:19.587 --> 30:20.789
In your opinion.

30:22.156 --> 30:24.559
Others of us may believe,
as the poet said,

30:24.592 --> 30:27.361
"'Tis hope is the most
hopeless thing of all."

30:29.363 --> 30:31.365
What a sad conviction.

30:33.568 --> 30:36.538
I prefer to believe,
as Johnson did,

30:36.571 --> 30:40.608
that hope is
a "chief happiness
which this world affords."

30:40.642 --> 30:43.545
But, perhaps,

30:43.578 --> 30:46.280
you hope for
something unworthy,

30:46.313 --> 30:48.616
in which case
you deserve to hope
in vain.

30:49.450 --> 30:51.385
Confess, sir.

30:51.418 --> 30:54.488
You were hoping to win
at the gaming tables
and have lost,

30:54.522 --> 30:57.491
and are now indulging
in a fit of pique.

30:57.525 --> 30:59.960
I would not confess
to such childish conduct.

31:03.197 --> 31:06.300
Though had I played,
I would have hoped to win.

31:08.001 --> 31:10.638
So you contend you hope
for something worthy?

31:10.672 --> 31:12.172
I do, indeed.

31:12.206 --> 31:15.175
Then it is my hope
that you obtain it.

31:15.209 --> 31:16.176
I am honored.

31:18.011 --> 31:21.382
Perhaps I am mistaken
in thinking hope
a useless thing.

31:27.522 --> 31:28.523
[chuckles]

31:30.525 --> 31:32.660
I-- I'm...
Excuse me.

31:32.694 --> 31:36.096
I'm sorry.
I disturbed you. I...

31:36.130 --> 31:38.031
I should go.
No.

31:38.065 --> 31:41.468
No. I should be
the one to leave.

31:41.503 --> 31:44.405
I have spent enough time
in solitary reflection.

31:52.980 --> 31:56.250
I would be honored,
once you return
to the ballroom,

31:56.283 --> 31:57.685
to be properly introduced.

32:13.735 --> 32:15.436
Anyway,
as my mother always said,

32:15.469 --> 32:18.205
I am a natural-born dancer.
I really am.

32:18.238 --> 32:19.973
I mean, dancing runs
in my fam--
Cassidy.

32:20.007 --> 32:21.543
Excuse me.

32:21.576 --> 32:24.244
Where have you been?
I have a likely prospect
for you.

32:24.278 --> 32:26.280
Young filly,
deep-chested, long legs.

32:26.313 --> 32:28.182
I very much regret using
this horse analogy.

32:28.215 --> 32:29.717
No, I think
you'll like this one.

32:29.751 --> 32:31.285
She has quite
the air of mystery
about her.

32:31.318 --> 32:33.120
That sounds alarming.

32:33.153 --> 32:35.523
I tend to
keep my distance from
mysterious young ladies.

32:35.557 --> 32:40.160
Besides,
I think I just found
a likely prospect of my own.

32:40.194 --> 32:42.362
I just wonder
how long she'll stay
in the orangery.

32:43.598 --> 32:46.266
Sorry?
Sorry, what's that?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.336
Did you meet--
Did you say you just
met someone in the orangery?

32:49.369 --> 32:53.273
Yes. Though she's
probably married
or equally ineligible.

32:57.712 --> 33:00.447
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

33:00.481 --> 33:02.216
[guest] Lord Cassidy.
Sorry.

33:02.249 --> 33:05.352
Oh.
Where is he off to?
[Cassidy] Excuse me!

33:13.528 --> 33:17.498
Selina, did you--
did you just meet
a gentleman in here?

33:17.532 --> 33:19.266
Yes.
He was delightful.

33:19.299 --> 33:20.668
Excellent!
[guest laughs]

33:20.702 --> 33:22.537
I do not see
what's excellent about it.

33:22.570 --> 33:24.304
Julia says
I'm not to leave this room.

33:24.338 --> 33:25.439
She says
she has to create an--

33:25.472 --> 33:27.709
an "aura of mystery"
about me.

33:27.742 --> 33:31.478
Forget what Julia told you.
We're returning
to the ballroom immediately.

33:31.513 --> 33:33.413
Why? Do you know
the gentleman?

33:34.549 --> 33:36.450
I rather think I do.
Come on.

33:38.118 --> 33:39.621
Quickly.
Quickly.

33:42.256 --> 33:45.192
My dear girl,
where have you been?

33:45.225 --> 33:47.629
I see your dance card
is empty.

33:47.662 --> 33:50.698
Do not be so judicious.
Hmm?

33:50.732 --> 33:52.099
Do you want
a drink?
No.

33:52.132 --> 33:53.133
Julia.

33:56.538 --> 33:59.306
What are you doing here?

33:59.339 --> 34:03.210
The beau monde
is fascinated by
the mysterious incognita.

34:03.243 --> 34:05.780
There has been
an interesting
development.

34:05.813 --> 34:07.481
Mr. Malcolm!

34:07.515 --> 34:10.552
There's someone
I want to
introduce you to.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.420
M-Mr. Malcolm?

34:15.222 --> 34:15.790
That is correct.

34:17.759 --> 34:20.527
[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
Mr. Malcolm,
how lovely to see you,

34:20.562 --> 34:22.496
and how well you look.

34:24.666 --> 34:28.503
Mrs. Thistlewaite.
Miss Thistlewaite.

34:30.538 --> 34:32.239
Mr. Malcolm.

34:32.272 --> 34:35.510
I, however, have yet
to learn your name.

34:35.543 --> 34:40.882
Mr. Jeremy Malcolm,
may I present
Miss Selina Dalton?

34:40.915 --> 34:42.684
Miss Dalton,

34:42.717 --> 34:46.721
I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance,
properly.

34:48.822 --> 34:51.224
-[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
Now, tell me, Mr. Malcolm.
-Hmm?

34:51.257 --> 34:54.829
Will your delightful mother,
Her Ladyship,
be joining us this season?

34:54.862 --> 34:56.731
"Properly"?

34:56.764 --> 34:59.366
They stumbled upon
each other moments ago
in the orangery.

34:59.399 --> 35:01.669
How unpredictable!
It's wonderful.

35:01.703 --> 35:05.873
I was hoping, Miss Dalton,
perhaps you might join me

35:05.907 --> 35:08.342
for a tour of
the Dulwich Picture Gallery
tomorrow.

35:11.445 --> 35:14.649
Thank you.
That would be nice.

35:14.682 --> 35:15.817
Tomorrow, then.

35:18.686 --> 35:19.721
Lord Cassidy.

35:20.588 --> 35:21.589
Y-Yes.

35:22.456 --> 35:23.457
Well done.

35:25.359 --> 35:26.594
[gasps]

35:31.699 --> 35:33.501
[chattering]

35:34.769 --> 35:37.505
Mr. Malcolm courting
yet another one.

35:37.538 --> 35:39.807
Shh! I think
he might hear you.

35:42.442 --> 35:47.180
Well, you most certainly
have a reputation.

35:47.214 --> 35:48.650
As?

35:49.483 --> 35:50.685
A trifler?

35:52.352 --> 35:53.688
Well, yes.

35:54.722 --> 35:55.890
Breaker
of hearts?

35:57.257 --> 35:59.326
I suppose
one could say that.

36:01.294 --> 36:03.531
A destroyer
of young ladies' dreams?

36:06.601 --> 36:09.336
That is
an absurd exaggeration,

36:09.369 --> 36:12.540
but I have heard
rumors along those lines.

36:14.809 --> 36:15.810
And you?

36:17.411 --> 36:19.614
Do you believe
this description of me?

36:23.017 --> 36:26.954
I am not ready
to pass judgment.

36:26.988 --> 36:29.891
Well, I am glad
to hear you say that,
Miss Dalton,

36:29.924 --> 36:34.562
for I do not believe
I deserve this reputation
I have acquired.

36:34.595 --> 36:36.764
Particularly in the case
of Miss Thistlewaite,

36:36.798 --> 36:38.633
I find myself blameless.

36:38.666 --> 36:42.837
She told me you paid her
very marked attentions.

36:42.870 --> 36:45.238
I escorted her
to the opera once.

36:45.272 --> 36:48.442
I see. Was it
an amusing opera?

36:51.378 --> 36:53.815
No.
No, it wasn't.

36:53.848 --> 36:56.017
The soprano missed
most of her notes,

36:56.050 --> 37:00.253
and Miss Thistlewaite
wore this feather which
brushed against my nose

37:00.287 --> 37:01.889
so frequently
over the course
of the evening,

37:01.923 --> 37:03.658
I found myself
wanting to sneeze.

37:03.691 --> 37:07.895
Well,
you and Miss Thistlewaite
are the victims

37:07.929 --> 37:09.997
of a most egregious
set of circumstances.

37:10.031 --> 37:12.633
Feathers
and screeching sopranos

37:12.667 --> 37:14.301
are not conducive
to romance.

37:18.906 --> 37:22.510
So you acquit me

37:22.543 --> 37:24.746
of trifling with
Miss Thistlewaite's affections?

37:29.050 --> 37:31.619
I am-- I am afraid
I cannot.

37:33.054 --> 37:35.422
You were
too easily put off.

37:37.058 --> 37:40.027
A sincere gentleman
would have tried
a second time

37:40.061 --> 37:43.497
before casting a woman aside
in the public eye.

37:43.531 --> 37:46.701
Invited her to
a musical concert, perhaps.

37:46.734 --> 37:49.302
But I knew
I was not interested
in Miss Thistlewaite

37:49.336 --> 37:50.571
after the opera.

37:50.605 --> 37:52.405
Had I continued
to pursue her,

37:52.439 --> 37:54.609
I would have deserved
the reputation
I have acquired.

37:56.511 --> 37:59.981
So what would
you have me do
in such circumstances?

38:00.014 --> 38:02.650
Jeremy?
[laughs]

38:02.683 --> 38:03.551
Excuse me.

38:03.584 --> 38:05.520
Jeremy Malcolm.

38:05.553 --> 38:08.656
Henry Ossory,
as I live and breathe!
What are you doing here?

38:08.689 --> 38:10.858
I thought you were
stationed with your regiment
in the north.

38:10.892 --> 38:14.629
I'm just in town
for the memorial
of Lieutenant Colonel Donoghue.

38:14.662 --> 38:16.664
But I am thinking
of selling out

38:16.697 --> 38:19.667
and joining the ranks
of you idle gentlemen wastrels.

38:19.700 --> 38:20.968
Are you sure
you're up to it?

38:21.002 --> 38:23.004
It can be
quite exhausting.
Well...

38:23.037 --> 38:27.909
Excuse me, Miss Dalton.
May I present
Captain Henry Ossory?

38:27.942 --> 38:29.677
Miss Dalton?

38:29.710 --> 38:31.512
Captain Ossory?

38:31.546 --> 38:33.480
[laughs]
Miss Selina Dalton?

38:33.514 --> 38:35.049
Yes.

38:35.082 --> 38:37.752
I take it the two of you
are familiar
with each other.

38:37.785 --> 38:40.621
Yes. Miss Dalton was
an excellent friend
of my uncle's widow.

38:40.655 --> 38:43.057
I wanted to thank you
for your kindness to my aunt.

38:43.090 --> 38:44.491
I see.

38:44.525 --> 38:46.928
But what
a fortunate coincidence

38:46.961 --> 38:48.361
to come upon you
so unexpectedly.

38:48.395 --> 38:49.664
How opportune.

38:49.697 --> 38:51.566
I am very pleased
to meet you, Captain.

38:51.599 --> 38:53.801
I esteemed your aunt
very highly

38:53.835 --> 38:55.837
and have long wished
to express my condolences.

38:55.870 --> 38:57.805
Why, thank you.

38:57.839 --> 39:01.075
I served as a companion
to Captain Ossory's aunt
in Bath

39:01.108 --> 39:02.577
during her final years.

39:02.610 --> 39:03.978
How very kind.

39:06.446 --> 39:10.852
Well, I should let you
resume your tour
with Mr. Malcolm.

39:10.885 --> 39:13.521
But I would be pleased
to call on you,

39:13.554 --> 39:15.488
if you would give me
your direction.

39:15.523 --> 39:17.758
I am staying
at the Thistlewaites'
in Berkeley Square.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.728
Well, Mr. Malcolm.

39:20.761 --> 39:21.662
Ossory.

39:22.462 --> 39:23.463
Miss Dalton.

39:26.701 --> 39:32.506
Oh. Uh, do make sure
you see the <i>Venus and Adonis.</i>
Quite exquisite.

39:33.875 --> 39:34.876
Goodbye.

39:35.977 --> 39:37.745
What a fortuitous meeting.

39:38.779 --> 39:39.814
Quite.

39:39.847 --> 39:41.448
Look at Mr. Malcolm.

39:41.481 --> 39:45.019
Doesn't look pleased,
does he?
[snores]

39:47.188 --> 39:50.490
[humming]

39:50.524 --> 39:52.026
[Julia] Good evening, Molly.
Do not mind us!

39:52.059 --> 39:54.095
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

39:54.128 --> 39:56.931
[Julia] Selina must be
absolutely famished.
Good evening, Molly.

39:56.964 --> 39:58.833
[Julia]
Just a little something.

39:58.866 --> 40:00.101
It's beautiful.

40:00.134 --> 40:01.836
[humming]

40:03.838 --> 40:04.872
So...

40:05.873 --> 40:07.808
what did he say about me?

40:07.842 --> 40:11.646
Um, merely
that he escorted you
to the opera.

40:11.679 --> 40:15.950
I must admit, Julia,
that does not seem
such a heinous crime.

40:15.983 --> 40:18.552
Did he tell you
about my eyelashes?

40:18.586 --> 40:19.553
Your eyelashes?

40:19.587 --> 40:21.589
[scoffs]

40:21.622 --> 40:25.092
Just wait until he starts
to weigh you up against
that list of his.

40:25.126 --> 40:28.095
Then you'll see
how unpleasant he can be.

40:28.129 --> 40:29.764
Oh, Selina.

40:29.797 --> 40:31.565
[sighs]

40:33.501 --> 40:36.537
I need you to help me.

40:36.570 --> 40:38.806
There's no way
I can touch him.

40:38.839 --> 40:41.542
He holds all
of London society
in his palm.

40:41.575 --> 40:45.546
But I'm just not sure
he is the villain
you paint him to be.

40:46.981 --> 40:50.084
I want him humiliated,
as I was.

40:51.919 --> 40:56.557
More than anything, I--
I want my reputation restored.

40:58.259 --> 40:59.994
And my--

41:00.027 --> 41:03.531
my prospects are dwindling.

41:03.564 --> 41:07.068
I truly understand,
but maybe...

41:07.101 --> 41:11.238
I have known you
nearly all my life.

41:11.272 --> 41:16.210
And you have known
Malcolm for, what,
less than a day?

41:16.243 --> 41:19.113
Ugh. He has this effect
on all women.

41:19.146 --> 41:22.683
It's like he exercises
some kind of power over them.

41:24.051 --> 41:26.754
He did not exercise
any power over me.

41:28.089 --> 41:30.591
Are you sure?

41:30.624 --> 41:35.262
You did not find something
mesmerizing about him?

41:37.898 --> 41:43.537
I cannot deny that
I see a certain...

41:43.571 --> 41:45.906
[clears throat]
attraction.

41:45.940 --> 41:46.841
I knew it.

41:48.709 --> 41:53.047
You're being blinded
by his intelligent conversation

41:53.080 --> 41:56.817
and devastatingly handsome
good looks.

41:56.851 --> 42:00.187
Well, take it from me,
it leads to nowhere.

42:12.099 --> 42:14.568
Are you feeling well today,
Julia?

42:15.169 --> 42:16.937
Yes, quite well.

42:16.971 --> 42:18.005
[door opens]

42:18.873 --> 42:20.107
Captain Ossory.

42:21.842 --> 42:24.912
Oh. I'm not acquainted
with a Captain Ossory.

42:24.945 --> 42:26.180
Are you, Julia?

42:26.213 --> 42:28.315
Captain Ossory is
an acquaintance of mine.

42:29.650 --> 42:32.119
Oh. Send him in at once.

42:41.028 --> 42:43.898
May I present
Captain Ossory to you,
ma'am?

42:43.931 --> 42:47.101
Captain Ossory,
Mrs. Thistlewaite
and Miss Thistlewaite.

42:47.134 --> 42:50.738
Your servant, Mrs. Thistlewaite,
Miss Thistlewaite.

42:50.771 --> 42:53.007
Please be seated,
Captain.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.776
Thank you, ma'am,
but actually
I came to request

42:55.810 --> 42:58.179
the pleasure of a promenade
with Miss Dalton.

42:58.979 --> 43:00.614
Another one!

43:00.648 --> 43:02.950
That would be lovely.

43:02.983 --> 43:05.219
Please excuse me
while I collect my things.

43:05.252 --> 43:06.353
[Ossory] Of course.

43:15.362 --> 43:17.998
[sighs, chuckles]

43:18.032 --> 43:19.767
[clears throat]

43:20.701 --> 43:23.370
So, Captain Ossory?

43:23.404 --> 43:24.605
Yes.

43:26.674 --> 43:29.944
I was not aware
that Selina had
an acquaintance in town.

43:29.977 --> 43:32.813
Yes, Miss Dalton was
a dear friend of my aunt's.

43:34.415 --> 43:37.751
It's very strange.
She's never mentioned you.

43:37.785 --> 43:38.953
Pity.

43:41.021 --> 43:44.425
Are you situated in town
or is this a flying visit?

43:44.458 --> 43:48.762
Newly situated, yes.
I hope you don't mind
the intrusion.

43:48.796 --> 43:53.100
A friend of Selina's
is surely a friend
of mine-- Ours.

43:55.202 --> 43:57.271
Thank you both.
How kind.

43:58.906 --> 44:00.774
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

44:02.109 --> 44:04.278
Mrs. Thistlewaite,
Miss Thistlewaite,

44:04.311 --> 44:06.013
lovely to meet you both.

44:07.781 --> 44:08.782
Indeed.

44:14.188 --> 44:15.356
[door closes]

44:17.958 --> 44:18.826
What?

44:18.859 --> 44:20.427
[children laughing]

44:20.461 --> 44:22.930
[Ossory] I'm not sure
if you are aware, Miss Dalton,

44:22.963 --> 44:25.966
but my aunt
mentioned you many times
in her correspondence with me.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.836
Your aunt spoke of you
quite often, as well.

44:28.869 --> 44:31.972
I am very pleased
to have this opportunity
to make your acquaintance.

44:32.006 --> 44:34.241
Yes,
I feel likewise.

44:34.275 --> 44:37.912
I must admit, however,
to yet another motive
for seeking you out.

44:39.046 --> 44:41.081
I came to London
to meet you

44:41.115 --> 44:44.952
because it's my belief
that my aunt desired us
to make a match.

44:44.985 --> 44:47.922
[stammers, laughs]

44:47.955 --> 44:50.424
What gave you
that impression?
[laughs]

44:50.457 --> 44:52.927
Well,
her letter to me
before her death,

44:52.960 --> 44:56.297
in it she wrote,
"It is my desire that you
and Miss Dalton make a match."

44:56.330 --> 45:00.434
I see. Then it appears
you interpreted
her meaning correctly.

45:00.467 --> 45:01.802
Yes, yes.

45:01.835 --> 45:03.837
Her words were
rather plain.

45:03.871 --> 45:06.207
Unless, of course,
she could have been
speaking of cribbage.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.475
She could have meant
we should engage
in a cribbage match.

45:08.510 --> 45:11.445
Or chess.
Could she not have been
speaking of chess?

45:11.478 --> 45:15.049
I am afraid not.
She knew me to be a very,
very poor chess player.

45:16.317 --> 45:20.487
Ah. Um, good day, Henry.
Miss Dalton.

45:20.522 --> 45:22.856
Jeremy.
Good day, Mr. Malcolm.

45:22.890 --> 45:26.160
It appears
I have interrupted
a humorous discussion.

45:26.193 --> 45:28.295
Well...
It was nothing
of consequence.

45:28.329 --> 45:32.967
We were discussing a letter
Captain Ossory received
from his aunt.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.301
Lovely.
[chuckles]

45:35.035 --> 45:36.504
Good.

45:36.538 --> 45:39.373
Well, I wondered if
you were to attend

45:39.406 --> 45:41.408
Lady Hartley's ball
week after next.

45:41.442 --> 45:44.178
-I believe I am.
-Excellent.

45:44.211 --> 45:48.550
As it happens,
I too am to attend
Lady Hartley's ball.

45:48.583 --> 45:50.884
Perhaps I might be
favored with a dance?

45:50.918 --> 45:53.787
Certainly.
[chuckles]
Excellent.

45:53.821 --> 45:56.123
Well, shall we?
Mm-hmm.

45:56.156 --> 45:57.424
After you.

46:09.236 --> 46:10.404
Good day,
sir.

46:13.575 --> 46:16.143
[gossiper 1]
I've heard
she's from Sussex!

46:16.176 --> 46:18.479
I must say,
whatever is the matter,
dear Selina?

46:18.513 --> 46:20.281
[gossiper 2]
Where is Sussex?

46:20.314 --> 46:24.451
I, um--
I received correspondence
from my mother.

46:24.485 --> 46:27.821
She's asked me to call on
my cousin's widow,
Mrs. Covington,

46:27.855 --> 46:29.323
while I'm in town.

46:29.356 --> 46:30.791
Whatever is wrong
with her?

46:31.526 --> 46:33.427
When I met her last,

46:33.460 --> 46:36.864
she would not
accept me at my word
that I had no beau.

46:36.897 --> 46:39.099
She quizzed me
on the subject
for 20 minutes

46:39.133 --> 46:41.536
before offering
to find me a husband.

46:41.569 --> 46:43.237
I hate to think
how she'll react

46:43.270 --> 46:45.939
when she finds out
I'm still unwed.

46:45.973 --> 46:49.476
She was married,
widowed and married again
by our age.

46:49.511 --> 46:50.512
How vulgar.

46:52.580 --> 46:54.214
Selina,
whatever you do,

46:54.248 --> 46:56.116
do not mention
to Mr. Malcolm

46:56.150 --> 46:59.053
that you have
such a vulgar cousin.

46:59.086 --> 47:01.922
One of the requirements
on his list is:

47:01.955 --> 47:04.958
"Has genteel relations
from good society."

47:04.992 --> 47:09.363
[Selina]
I wouldn't call the Daltons
"from good society."

47:09.396 --> 47:13.434
But, Selina,
you're the daughter
of a clergyman.

47:13.467 --> 47:17.505
That's at least
fourth-class society,
possibly even third.

47:17.539 --> 47:19.073
At best.

47:19.106 --> 47:22.176
Oh, and while
we're speaking of it,

47:22.209 --> 47:24.411
at the dinner party,
you will need to play
the pianoforte.

47:24.445 --> 47:26.413
What?

47:26.447 --> 47:29.651
Musical talent
is another requirement
on Malcolm's list.

47:29.684 --> 47:32.086
Malcolm,
he loves music.

47:32.119 --> 47:34.988
But I don't play
the pianoforte.

47:35.022 --> 47:37.491
I am surprised
Mr. Malcolm desires a wife

47:37.525 --> 47:41.195
when he could
just as easily hire
a performing bear.

47:41.228 --> 47:45.399
Do not worry,
dear Selina.
I have a plan.

47:47.301 --> 47:50.505
[Julia] Mr. Banbury,
how's your wife?

47:50.538 --> 47:53.474
[Julia]
<i>So, tell me, Captain Ossory,</i>

47:53.508 --> 47:56.544
how are you finding
society life so far?

47:56.578 --> 47:59.480
I seem to be
constantly thwarted
in my endeavors.

47:59.514 --> 48:03.083
Hmm. What endeavors
are those, may I ask?

48:04.084 --> 48:05.285
The art of courtship.

48:06.420 --> 48:08.355
[Cassidy] Well, ladies?

48:08.389 --> 48:10.190
What do we think?

48:10.224 --> 48:13.293
Tolerable enough?
Handsome enough to tempt?
[Malcolm laughs]

48:13.327 --> 48:18.399
I find courting
to be less an art
than an avocation.

48:18.432 --> 48:20.702
[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
You served in
the Peninsular,

48:20.735 --> 48:22.570
did you not,
Captain Ossory?

48:22.604 --> 48:25.507
Yes, in the 18th Regiment
of Light Dragoons.

48:25.540 --> 48:28.108
Did you see any action,
Captain?

48:28.142 --> 48:30.144
Yes, at Waterloo.

48:30.177 --> 48:33.681
I saw more death
than a man should,
but a great victory all round.

48:33.715 --> 48:35.249
How brave.

48:35.282 --> 48:36.584
[chuckles]

48:36.618 --> 48:39.353
Swapping a battlefield
for a ballroom.

48:39.386 --> 48:41.455
How ironic.

48:41.488 --> 48:43.190
Perhaps.

48:43.223 --> 48:45.359
However,
I still find myself
surrounded by

48:45.392 --> 48:48.328
a multitude of sweaty men
desperate for female company.

48:48.362 --> 48:50.998
[all laugh]

48:51.031 --> 48:54.034
Miss Dalton, tell me,
how do you know
Miss Thistlewaite?

48:54.067 --> 48:56.403
-You met at school,
I believe?
-Yes, we attended--

48:56.437 --> 49:01.041
We, uh, both attended
Mrs. Finch's
Ladies Academy as girls.

49:01.074 --> 49:04.178
I attended on the
kindness of a benefactor
of my father's.

49:04.211 --> 49:08.182
I was bullied quite terribly,
but Julia was kind to me.

49:08.215 --> 49:09.617
Mmm.

49:09.651 --> 49:11.719
Miss Dalton,
I was curious,

49:11.753 --> 49:14.254
what is your opinion
on the Church Building Act?

49:16.290 --> 49:19.326
[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
What a weighty question
to ask over soup.

49:20.461 --> 49:23.197
I believe
it is in bad taste

49:23.230 --> 49:27.134
to discuss politics
before the entrée is served.

49:27.167 --> 49:28.703
Perhaps you are correct.

49:28.736 --> 49:31.338
However, I am interested
in Miss Dalton's opinion.

49:35.342 --> 49:37.277
Well,

49:37.311 --> 49:39.112
as the daughter
of a clergyman,

49:39.146 --> 49:41.248
it is obviously
important to me

49:41.281 --> 49:43.751
that there are
houses of worship
available to all.

49:43.785 --> 49:45.486
However,

49:45.520 --> 49:47.755
I feel that
the million pounds set aside

49:47.789 --> 49:49.724
for this purpose
is exorbitant.

49:49.757 --> 49:52.594
I believe our government
intends by this measure

49:52.627 --> 49:55.095
to suppress the radicals
and keep anarchy at bay,

49:55.128 --> 49:56.698
when they could use
some of those funds

49:56.731 --> 49:58.198
to better
the lot of the poor,

49:58.232 --> 50:00.100
thereby accomplishing
the same purpose.

50:00.133 --> 50:02.269
They could just
pay us better.

50:02.302 --> 50:03.370
[cutlery clatters]

50:04.506 --> 50:07.809
Hear! Hear!
[all laugh]

50:07.842 --> 50:09.409
Wonderful.

50:09.443 --> 50:10.712
I apologize
for the lecture,

50:10.745 --> 50:13.046
but you did ask me
for my opinion.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.149
I am sure your father himself
could not preach
a more eloquent sermon.

50:16.183 --> 50:17.552
[Ossory clears throat]
And you, Mr. Malcolm,

50:17.585 --> 50:19.621
what's your opinion
on the matter?

50:19.654 --> 50:22.557
Although I doubt
you will be able to express
your argument as well.

50:22.590 --> 50:24.358
[chuckles]

50:24.391 --> 50:26.426
It's very much the same,
actually.

50:26.460 --> 50:29.263
[piano playing]

50:38.740 --> 50:40.808
[Cassidy humming]

50:44.779 --> 50:47.549
[playing continues]

51:05.132 --> 51:07.100
[Ossory chuckles]

51:07.134 --> 51:08.703
Good shot,
Miss Thistlewaite.

51:18.145 --> 51:19.714
[chuckles]
Oh.

51:19.747 --> 51:22.282
[laughs]
I must be nearsighted!

51:22.316 --> 51:23.751
[Cassidy] Selina,

51:23.785 --> 51:26.788
you're taking losing
mighty well.

51:26.821 --> 51:29.089
How amiable
and even-tempered of you.

51:33.160 --> 51:35.095
Take another shot,
my dear.

51:35.730 --> 51:37.264
May I assist?

51:38.365 --> 51:39.366
Yes.

51:42.202 --> 51:47.240
So, keep your shoulders
in line with the target.

51:49.242 --> 51:51.378
Ball between your feet.
A little more.

51:52.747 --> 51:54.114
[Malcolm] Hands steady.

51:57.819 --> 52:00.888
Deep breath in.
[inhales]

52:03.758 --> 52:06.159
[exclaims]
Thank you.

52:06.193 --> 52:07.394
Brilliant.

52:07.427 --> 52:09.831
All right,
Captain Ossory.

52:09.864 --> 52:12.667
It's your shot
for the win.

52:12.700 --> 52:16.704
It's an easterly wind,
so aim a little
to the right.

52:16.738 --> 52:18.271
[clears throat]

52:21.809 --> 52:23.878
Well done.
[Cassidy] Marvelous!

52:23.911 --> 52:27.247
[Julia] It would have been
a shame to lose
on such an easy shot.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.816
[Cassidy]
Can you pass me the shawl?
Quite.

52:28.850 --> 52:31.819
My legs are cold.
The wind was,
uh, westerly.

52:31.853 --> 52:33.921
If I had listened to you,
I would have.

52:33.955 --> 52:37.592
Oh, Captain.
I'm pretty sure
it's to the east.

52:37.625 --> 52:39.827
I'm surprised you lasted
that long in the cavalry

52:39.861 --> 52:41.696
with such a dreadful
sense of direction.

52:41.729 --> 52:45.432
[laughs]
Besides,
I never lose.

52:46.501 --> 52:47.669
Neither do I.

52:54.976 --> 52:57.477
My lords and ladies,
may I have your attention,
please?

52:57.512 --> 53:00.515
Lot seven,
an eight-year-old
Irish draft mare.

53:00.548 --> 53:02.315
All of 16 hands.

53:02.349 --> 53:05.385
Well-schooled and hunted,
she's sporting countryside.

53:05.419 --> 53:06.821
Have I an opening bid
of 150...

53:06.854 --> 53:08.523
[Cassidy]
My mother used to always say,

53:08.556 --> 53:10.357
"Never, ever, ever
go near a horse--"

53:10.390 --> 53:12.560
Enough about the horses!

53:12.593 --> 53:14.696
Tell us what Malcolm
thinks of our girl.

53:14.729 --> 53:17.565
No, please,
not this again.

53:17.598 --> 53:21.803
He told me that he
was initially impressed

53:21.836 --> 53:24.806
by her wit and humor,
um,

53:24.839 --> 53:27.575
but was concerned
that she was not
serious enough.

53:27.608 --> 53:30.611
But after the dinner party,
that fear was laid to rest.

53:30.645 --> 53:32.947
"Not serious enough."

53:32.980 --> 53:35.248
He certainly makes
rash judgments.

53:35.282 --> 53:36.584
It's as I've told you,
Selina.

53:36.617 --> 53:38.019
There is
no pleasing the man.

53:38.052 --> 53:40.555
No, no. Look, I may have
quoted him incorrectly.

53:40.588 --> 53:42.590
He was very,
very complimentary.

53:42.623 --> 53:45.927
He said you've nearly met
all of the qualifications
on his list,

53:45.960 --> 53:46.794
which is a good thing.

53:46.828 --> 53:48.863
Oh, dear.

53:48.896 --> 53:52.332
I know this is
hard to hear, Selina,
but it shall be over soon.

53:52.365 --> 53:54.969
-Julia, that's not
what I'm saying.
-Selina! [gasps]

53:55.002 --> 53:56.738
Selina Dalton!

53:56.771 --> 53:59.540
How rude!
As I live and breathe.

53:59.574 --> 54:02.543
Cousin Gertie!
What a surprise!

54:02.577 --> 54:04.411
May I introduce
my dear friend...

54:04.444 --> 54:06.047
Miss Thistlewaite.

54:06.080 --> 54:08.816
Miss Thistlewaite.
[laughs]

54:08.850 --> 54:10.051
That's a mouthful.

54:10.084 --> 54:12.053
Miss Thistlewaite.
[laughs]

54:12.086 --> 54:13.921
Say that one 20 times.

54:13.955 --> 54:16.824
Miss Thistlewaite.
Miss Thistlewaite. Miss--
[laughing]

54:16.858 --> 54:20.561
Say it, try, try!
Miss Thistlewaite.
Miss-- You can't do it!

54:20.595 --> 54:24.632
What you need, my girl,
is a husband

54:24.665 --> 54:28.069
so you can change
that ghastly tongue twister
of a name.

54:28.102 --> 54:29.904
[laughing]

54:29.937 --> 54:33.306
Mrs. Covington,
may I introduce you
to Lord Cassidy?

54:33.340 --> 54:36.677
How do you do?
[Mrs. Covington]
Oh, Lord. [chuckles]

54:36.711 --> 54:38.311
Hey, Malcolm.
Malcolm!

54:38.345 --> 54:41.015
[Mrs. Covington] Is that
the famous Mr. Malcolm?

54:41.048 --> 54:43.584
Do you know him?
I saw the most
hilarious caricature of him

54:43.618 --> 54:45.052
a few weeks past.

54:45.086 --> 54:46.754
[gasps]
I didn't know
you were here.

54:46.788 --> 54:49.389
Mr. Malcolm.
Captain Ossory.

54:50.423 --> 54:52.359
What a wonderful
surprise.

54:52.392 --> 54:54.595
Nice to see you again,
Miss Thistlewaite.
[clears throat]

54:56.697 --> 54:58.733
Mrs. Covington,

54:58.766 --> 55:03.403
may I present
the Honorable Mr. Malcolm
and Captain Henry Ossory.

55:03.436 --> 55:06.406
I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Covington.

55:06.439 --> 55:07.542
Mrs. Covington.

55:07.575 --> 55:10.778
No, sir, it is I
who am delighted.

55:10.812 --> 55:13.480
[chuckles, stammers]

55:13.514 --> 55:19.754
Well, I have never been
in the same room with a captain,
a lord and an honorable.

55:19.787 --> 55:21.823
Although, I am not
quite exactly sure

55:21.856 --> 55:24.424
what it means
to be an honorable.

55:24.457 --> 55:27.128
It's the next best thing
to a lord, am I right?

55:27.161 --> 55:28.796
He is the younger son
of an earl.

55:28.830 --> 55:30.363
[Mrs. Covington]
Oh, oh, oh.

55:30.397 --> 55:32.600
Now, that's a real pity.

55:32.633 --> 55:35.570
Because you've got
the look of a lord,

55:35.603 --> 55:39.040
much more than
this young gentleman
over here. [laughs]

55:39.073 --> 55:41.742
You know, Mr. Malcolm
has a more, um...

55:41.776 --> 55:44.411
dignified look
about him.

55:44.444 --> 55:46.647
[Julia stammering]
Cassie,

55:46.681 --> 55:51.519
I think Mrs. Covington
would probably like
a drive home...

55:51.552 --> 55:52.920
by a lord.

55:52.954 --> 55:55.656
I'm sure His Lordship
has other plans

55:55.690 --> 55:56.456
for the rest
of the afternoon.

55:58.025 --> 56:00.728
No. No, he doesn't
have any plans.

56:00.761 --> 56:01.629
Julia, I do.
No, you don't.

56:02.864 --> 56:06.534
I do. No, I--
No, I don't.

56:06.567 --> 56:08.769
Thank you.
I would be honored.

56:08.803 --> 56:11.105
I am glad I dressed
so sensibly today.

56:11.138 --> 56:13.473
Is this hat
not ravishing on me?

56:13.507 --> 56:14.976
Quite.
Quite.

56:16.010 --> 56:17.845
Shall we go then?

56:17.879 --> 56:20.413
Of course,
of course.

56:20.447 --> 56:23.416
One thing I learned
in my two trips
to the altar

56:23.450 --> 56:28.421
is that the gentlemen
don't like to be
kept waiting.

56:28.455 --> 56:33.493
[cackling] Oh, yes!
They're never waiting.
Oh, yes.

56:33.527 --> 56:38.532
Selina,
Julia Thistlewaite--
I'll call sometime soon.

56:38.566 --> 56:40.601
Excuse me, sorry.
Yes!

56:40.635 --> 56:42.770
[muffled chuckle]

56:42.803 --> 56:46.874
And how are you acquainted
with Mrs. Covington?

56:46.908 --> 56:48.643
She-- She is--

56:48.676 --> 56:50.177
My cousin.

56:52.847 --> 56:54.882
-Your cousin?
-Yes.

56:54.916 --> 56:58.019
-Right.
-Seven times removed.

56:58.052 --> 57:00.621
Selina, my dear,
if we're not buying,
we'd better be going.

57:00.655 --> 57:02.657
Well,
before you leave,

57:02.690 --> 57:06.160
I was wondering if
Miss Dalton would join me
for a ride tomorrow?

57:08.195 --> 57:10.965
Um, I-I--

57:10.998 --> 57:13.668
She would be honored
to ride with you,
Mr. Malcolm.

57:15.069 --> 57:16.904
Now,
that's settled.

57:16.938 --> 57:21.242
Us ladies should
leave you gentlemen
to your stallions.

57:21.275 --> 57:22.510
Good afternoon.

57:22.543 --> 57:24.745
[auctioneer calling]

57:24.779 --> 57:25.947
Ladies.

57:27.248 --> 57:30.217
All done.
At 84, the seller in front.

57:30.251 --> 57:32.219
At 84 guineas, last. Sold!

57:32.253 --> 57:35.589
My dear Selina,
it is working.

57:35.623 --> 57:38.491
And now thanks to me,
you will not fail item six.

57:39.927 --> 57:42.495
I thought that must be
why you claimed her.

57:42.530 --> 57:45.166
Couldn't imagine
you felt a sudden desire
for her kinship.

57:45.199 --> 57:46.701
Ugh.

57:47.668 --> 57:48.736
No.

57:50.271 --> 57:52.472
Just do not
reverse course on me.

57:53.975 --> 57:55.910
I will not, Julia.

57:55.943 --> 57:58.980
I promise to be everything
he desires in a woman:

57:59.013 --> 58:02.650
witty, humorous,
serious, genteel,

58:02.683 --> 58:05.619
musical, fashionable,
only the best relations

58:05.653 --> 58:07.722
and all at the same time.

58:08.289 --> 58:09.523
Excellent.

58:15.796 --> 58:16.630
Selina!

58:18.833 --> 58:20.935
I thought you might
like to wear this.

58:23.137 --> 58:26.774
Oh. It is--
It is magnificent.

58:27.775 --> 58:28.809
But I cannot.

58:28.843 --> 58:30.011
Nonsense.

58:35.316 --> 58:41.055
[sighs] I must say,
it looks ravishing on you.

58:44.625 --> 58:45.826
It is yours now.

58:47.128 --> 58:48.295
Thank you, Julia.

58:49.630 --> 58:50.297
It is nothing.

58:51.632 --> 58:53.300
See you tonight.
See you tonight.

58:57.872 --> 58:59.006
Mmm.

58:59.907 --> 59:01.942
[ducks quacking]

59:12.219 --> 59:14.021
That is a very beautiful
bonnet on you.

59:15.322 --> 59:16.857
You are very quiet
this afternoon.

59:18.659 --> 59:21.262
Please don't feel the need
to make conversation.

59:21.295 --> 59:25.332
I much prefer silence
to those that rattle on
with nothing to say,

59:25.366 --> 59:27.201
like that Mrs. Covington.

59:27.234 --> 59:30.204
She's quite
the character, isn't she?

59:30.237 --> 59:33.040
I must say, I'm very glad
I'm not courting
Miss Thistlewaite.

59:34.308 --> 59:35.643
Beg your pardon?

59:36.710 --> 59:38.179
What do you mean?

59:38.212 --> 59:39.780
Well, I mean...

59:41.115 --> 59:43.050
Well, it's obvious,
isn't it?

59:43.084 --> 59:45.019
That I would want
my future companion's relations

59:45.052 --> 59:46.353
to have a modicum
of gentility.

59:46.387 --> 59:48.289
And if they did not?

01:00:08.342 --> 01:00:11.078
I'm sorry
I introduced the subject.

01:00:11.112 --> 01:00:12.947
'Tis a moot point,
after all.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.216
I'm not courting
Miss Thistlewaite.
I'm court--

01:00:16.951 --> 01:00:17.952
Well...

01:00:20.154 --> 01:00:23.157
I think it's quite clear
who it is I'm courting,
isn't it?

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:33.134
But if you were
still courting Julia
and you had met Mrs. Covington,

01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:35.002
would that affect
your opinion of Julia?

01:00:35.035 --> 01:00:37.271
Well, it would have to,
wouldn't it?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.877
There's a saying
where my family is from.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:47.148
[speaking Yoruba]

01:00:47.181 --> 01:00:50.417
A man who marries a woman
marries all her relatives.

01:00:55.222 --> 01:00:57.424
I'm sorry, I...

01:00:57.458 --> 01:00:58.792
I've said too much.

01:01:00.194 --> 01:01:02.096
I understand this is
quite overwhelming.

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:09.136
And what do you find
overwhelming, Mr. Malcolm?

01:01:13.007 --> 01:01:15.042
The society balls.

01:01:15.075 --> 01:01:16.744
Gold-rimmed tea cups.

01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:20.314
The tying of silk cravats.
All of this is very easy.

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:23.150
You learn the rules.
You follow the rules.

01:01:23.184 --> 01:01:25.186
If there is a moment
where there is no rule,

01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:26.820
you make a rule,
you follow that.

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.926
I find everything else
overwhelming.

01:01:38.332 --> 01:01:40.868
Why did you come
to London, Miss Dalton?

01:01:42.803 --> 01:01:44.104
Because
I was lonely.

01:01:45.507 --> 01:01:47.474
I was lonely, too,
before you came.

01:01:53.914 --> 01:01:59.186
I... I am having
a house party
at my estate in Kent,

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.422
and I would be pleased
if you would come
as my guest.

01:02:03.057 --> 01:02:04.858
I am honored
by the invitation,

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:06.827
but I am a guest
of the Thistlewaites.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.129
I will invite them as well.
And Cassie, of course.

01:02:09.163 --> 01:02:11.365
I'll even invite Ossory
if you'd like.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.436
My mother is coming
to act as hostess,

01:02:15.469 --> 01:02:19.406
and I thought perhaps
your parents might like
to come as well.

01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:24.078
Thank you.

01:02:24.111 --> 01:02:26.213
I shall write
and ask them.

01:02:28.282 --> 01:02:30.017
I suppose we should
be heading back.

01:02:33.521 --> 01:02:35.222
[rips]
[Selina gasps]

01:02:35.256 --> 01:02:36.490
Miss Dalton,
I am so sorry.

01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:37.992
I seem to have
torn your dress.

01:02:38.025 --> 01:02:39.226
'Tis no matter,
Mr. Malcolm.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:40.961
It can easily be repaired.

01:02:41.962 --> 01:02:44.932
Please, call me Jeremy.

01:02:47.134 --> 01:02:48.202
Jeremy.

01:03:00.981 --> 01:03:05.819
Did Mr. Malcolm mention
if Captain Ossory
has been invited?

01:03:05.853 --> 01:03:07.522
Yes. He told me
he's on the guest list.

01:03:07.555 --> 01:03:11.325
Ugh. What a bother
that man has become.

01:03:11.358 --> 01:03:14.495
[sighs] I shall have
to distract him, of course.

01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:18.499
My dear, have you thought about
Captain Ossory for yourself?

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:19.900
Mummy, no!

01:03:23.904 --> 01:03:26.106
He's a perfectly
good match,

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.943
but far too low down
in comparison
to our own good standing.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:32.012
Mm-hmm.

01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:36.950
[gasps]
We're here.

01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:45.859
Well, that certainly
looks impressive.

01:04:00.207 --> 01:04:05.346
A Mrs. Thistlewaite,
Miss Thistlewaite
and Miss Dalton, my lady.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.349
My darling Selina.

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:12.353
Mama!
I missed you so much!

01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:14.355
My little chickpea!

01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:16.658
[Mrs. Dalton]
You look so well!

01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:18.492
[Malcolm]
Welcome to Hadley Hall.

01:04:18.526 --> 01:04:21.028
Thank you.
It is beautiful.

01:04:22.196 --> 01:04:24.031
A little smaller
in real life.

01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:30.672
May I present my mother
Elizabeth Malcolm,
the Countess of Kilbourne.

01:04:30.705 --> 01:04:33.073
Lady Kilbourne
will do just fine.

01:04:33.107 --> 01:04:35.242
Mrs. Howard will
show you to your rooms.

01:04:35.275 --> 01:04:38.112
I thought you might like
to refresh yourselves
before joining us for tea.

01:04:38.145 --> 01:04:39.446
That would be lovely.

01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:43.050
How's Kitty?

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:46.186
[Mr. Dalton]
She was pining a little bit,
but she'll be fine.

01:04:48.255 --> 01:04:49.524
Miss Dalton...

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.395
I am very happy
you're here.

01:04:55.597 --> 01:04:57.331
I am very happy
to be here.

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:05.439
The stables
are in the East Wing.

01:05:08.142 --> 01:05:10.444
[grunts]
I could get used
to the country.

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:14.281
One day, I'll buy
a house just like this.

01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:16.417
[laughs]
Not on your salary.

01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:18.553
[groaning]

01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:24.391
My son tells me
you were raised in Sussex,
Miss Dalton.

01:05:24.425 --> 01:05:25.627
Yes, my lady.

01:05:26.594 --> 01:05:28.563
Which part of Sussex?

01:05:28.596 --> 01:05:29.597
Chailey.

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:38.071
And, Mr. Dalton,
I believe you still serve
as vicar there?

01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:41.208
Yes, my lady,
coming on nearly
20 years now.

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:44.646
And, Mrs. Dalton,
are your people
from Sussex as well?

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:48.148
My family's name
is Kingswater.

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.384
Kingswater.

01:05:53.487 --> 01:05:57.157
I'm afraid I do not know
any Kingswaters.

01:05:59.661 --> 01:06:02.162
[Mr. Dalton clears throat]
[bell chimes]

01:06:07.468 --> 01:06:10.270
Mrs. Thistlewaite,
we cannot thank you enough

01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:11.972
for taking care
of our Selina.

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:14.475
It's been no problem
at all.

01:06:16.243 --> 01:06:19.146
Selina, I forgot to ask you
how Mrs. Covington is.

01:06:19.179 --> 01:06:21.215
Did you call on her
as I asked?

01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:25.620
Mrs. Covington
is the widow of my cousin.
She lives in town.

01:06:25.653 --> 01:06:28.690
[coughing]

01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:30.692
I did run into
Mrs. Covington.

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.326
[Mrs. Dalton] Good.
I'm glad to hear it.

01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:39.466
Her husband
was my second cousin only,
but she is a widow.

01:06:39.501 --> 01:06:43.470
Mrs. Dalton and myself
have always taught Selina
to show compassion

01:06:43.505 --> 01:06:46.173
to those in less fortunate
circumstances.

01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:51.478
Pray, excuse me
as I take a turn about the room.

01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:55.048
He fell at Waterloo.
He died a hero's death
by all accounts.

01:06:55.082 --> 01:06:58.118
Cut down by cannon
while defending
Wellington's flank.

01:06:59.486 --> 01:07:01.556
There was nothing left
of him to bury,

01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:05.527
so we were forced
to conduct his funeral
in absentia.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.761
[Lady Kilbourne]
Terribly sad.

01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:08.596
Miss Dalton.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:10.765
I do not care
that Mrs. Covington
is your cousin

01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:12.466
and I am sorry
I gave that impression.

01:07:12.499 --> 01:07:14.134
It is I
who must apologize.

01:07:14.167 --> 01:07:16.336
I think you were concerned
for my good opinion

01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:19.641
and thought
if you told the truth,
you'd lose it.

01:07:19.674 --> 01:07:21.809
It is my fault.

01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:25.345
I sounded dreadfully arrogant
and I have regretted it
many times since.

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:27.615
I've been wanting
to tell you the truth,
but I--

01:07:27.649 --> 01:07:28.616
I believe you.

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:33.253
Then let's forget all about
this foolish incident.

01:07:33.287 --> 01:07:35.523
It does neither of us
any good to harp on it.

01:07:38.325 --> 01:07:42.095
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Dalton,
perhaps you could write
to your cousin

01:07:42.129 --> 01:07:44.431
and invite her
to join us
at next week's ball.

01:07:44.464 --> 01:07:47.167
That sounds like
such a fun idea.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.771
Don't you agree,
Mr. Dalton?
Yes.

01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:53.608
Well, I am confident
that the behavior
that prevails

01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:57.579
at these occasions in town
will not permit here.

01:07:57.612 --> 01:08:01.114
Mr. Malcolm seems
a very trustworthy gentleman.

01:08:03.183 --> 01:08:05.553
[knocking]
[Julia] <i>Selina?</i>

01:08:07.722 --> 01:08:09.089
May I come in?

01:08:10.357 --> 01:08:11.425
[sighs]

01:08:13.226 --> 01:08:14.227
Selina, I...

01:08:16.162 --> 01:08:18.198
I think it is time.

01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:21.368
If you think
it is time for bed,
I can only agree.

01:08:21.401 --> 01:08:23.871
[chuckles]
No.

01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:28.643
I think it is time
to show Mr. Malcolm
your list.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.555
Julia...

01:08:41.589 --> 01:08:45.760
I know Mr. Malcolm
hurt your feelings
and I am so sorry.

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:47.361
What are you saying?

01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:49.296
I am saying

01:08:49.328 --> 01:08:53.200
that I do not think
Mr. Malcolm is
the man you think he is.

01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:54.636
I see.

01:08:56.604 --> 01:09:00.508
Now that you have seen
Hadley Hall
and seen how rich he is,

01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:02.844
you think you can get him
to marry you, is that it?

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:04.612
I wonder if you would
like him as much

01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:08.415
if he was
a poverty-stricken curate
from Yorkshire.

01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:10.785
No, that is not it!

01:09:10.818 --> 01:09:13.787
I am not interested
in Mr. Malcolm
because of his possessions.

01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:15.790
[scoffs]

01:09:15.823 --> 01:09:18.926
He has been kind to me.

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:24.398
You agreed to help me.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.300
We were in this together.

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:30.437
I don't feel Mr. Malcolm
deserves such treatment.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.740
And I?

01:09:32.774 --> 01:09:35.274
You think I deserve
such treatment?

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:40.747
I was humiliated
in front of the whole
of good society.

01:09:40.782 --> 01:09:42.550
Have you never
offended anyone?

01:09:43.984 --> 01:09:45.653
It happens.

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:46.386
Frequently!

01:09:48.388 --> 01:09:51.291
No one wants a person
incapable of forgiveness
for a friend.

01:09:51.323 --> 01:09:54.428
And I don't want
a prosy preacher's daughter
for a friend.

01:09:56.931 --> 01:09:57.965
[exclaims]

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.502
This is mine!

01:10:06.974 --> 01:10:08.609
[door slams]

01:10:08.643 --> 01:10:10.511
[Malcolm] What was that?

01:10:10.545 --> 01:10:12.680
[Lady Kilbourne]
Probably that Miss Thistlewaite.

01:10:12.714 --> 01:10:14.782
She looks the
door-slamming type
to me.

01:10:18.052 --> 01:10:19.252
Thank you, Reeves.

01:10:21.022 --> 01:10:24.859
What surprises me
is that she did not
set her cap for you.

01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:28.596
She did, at first.
It was short-lived.

01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:30.765
What happened?

01:10:32.033 --> 01:10:37.505
Well, I took her
to the opera once and...

01:10:37.538 --> 01:10:39.741
did not call again.

01:10:39.774 --> 01:10:41.441
It died a natural death.

01:10:41.475 --> 01:10:44.045
Hmm.
So you think.

01:10:44.078 --> 01:10:47.949
I doubt she'd forget
that kind of rejection
very quickly.

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:52.653
She's not enjoying
taking second place
to your Miss Dalton.

01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:56.591
She's not my Miss Dalton.

01:10:56.624 --> 01:10:57.859
Not yet.

01:10:57.892 --> 01:10:59.727
Yes, I know.

01:11:02.329 --> 01:11:04.632
I do wish you would hurry
the business.

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:07.769
You know how much
I detest entertaining.

01:11:07.802 --> 01:11:10.705
So, you approve?

01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:14.307
If I had
my wits about me,

01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:17.512
I'd persuade you
to marry some silly,
ignorant girl

01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:20.313
against whom
I would not suffer
in comparison.

01:11:20.347 --> 01:11:22.650
Someone like
your brother's wife.

01:11:26.453 --> 01:11:28.823
Mother, you would suffer
no matter whom I married.

01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:32.527
And surely
you must know by now,

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.830
relations by marriage
were designed to aid us
in developing our character.

01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:38.633
Selina...

01:11:40.101 --> 01:11:43.604
Selina is a gift from God
in that regard.

01:11:43.638 --> 01:11:46.574
And far be it for me
to question the Almighty.

01:11:46.607 --> 01:11:49.342
Mr. Dalton would not approve.

01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:51.712
Checkmate.

01:11:51.746 --> 01:11:53.781
Yes, Mother. I know.

01:11:53.815 --> 01:11:55.382
[chuckles]

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.488
[bird squawks]
[gun fires]

01:12:01.522 --> 01:12:04.525
[dog barks]
[Selina] Well done.

01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:05.760
Thank you, sir.

01:12:05.793 --> 01:12:09.429
Selina!
Captain Ossory!

01:12:09.462 --> 01:12:11.799
[Julia] I think it should be
a masquerade.
They're all the rage.

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:13.768
[Cassidy]
Yeah, but I have to wear
a mask though.

01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:16.369
[Julia] It's not up to you.
It's Mr. Malcolm's home.

01:12:16.403 --> 01:12:18.139
[Cassidy]
Of course it is, but...
[sighs]

01:12:18.172 --> 01:12:21.108
We were just discussing
next week's ball.

01:12:21.142 --> 01:12:24.579
Right.
Julia wants it to be
a masquerade.

01:12:24.612 --> 01:12:26.113
What is your opinion?

01:12:26.147 --> 01:12:29.482
Well, I've never been
to a masquerade before.

01:12:29.517 --> 01:12:31.118
See, Mr. Malcolm?

01:12:31.152 --> 01:12:34.487
It must be a masquerade.
Selina has never been to one.

01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:35.857
Then it's decided.

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:37.758
A masquerade it is.

01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:40.127
I do believe we have
some costumes
in the attic, sir.

01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:41.963
Excellent.
Thank you, Reeves.

01:12:41.996 --> 01:12:45.032
Everyone feel free
to help yourselves.
Thank you.

01:12:45.066 --> 01:12:47.668
I should be able to find
what I need at the dressmakers.

01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.704
Do you plan on
going as a lady?

01:12:50.705 --> 01:12:52.472
Of course not. A Greek.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.408
Any particular Greek?

01:12:55.442 --> 01:12:57.111
[Cassidy]
Any Greek will do.

01:12:57.144 --> 01:12:59.146
-Julius Caesar.
-[laughs]

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.481
Julius Caesar
was Roman.

01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:03.184
Greek, Roman,
it scarcely matters.

01:13:03.217 --> 01:13:04.719
I plan to wear
a white robe

01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:06.721
and some leaves
over my ears.

01:13:06.754 --> 01:13:09.123
I went to one
of these blasted things
as Henry VIII once.

01:13:09.156 --> 01:13:10.658
I almost suffocated.

01:13:10.691 --> 01:13:11.859
I remember.

01:13:11.893 --> 01:13:14.128
What are you wearing,
Selina?

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:18.099
Um...
I have no idea.

01:13:18.132 --> 01:13:22.136
I was hoping
to get some inspiration
once I visited the attic.

01:13:22.169 --> 01:13:24.171
Why not go
as your namesake?

01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:25.706
Who do you mean?

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.175
Selene, goddess of the moon.

01:13:30.111 --> 01:13:32.780
Cassie has already taken
my costume.

01:13:32.813 --> 01:13:35.716
I told you,
I'm not going as a woman.

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:37.885
I'll be one
of those, um...

01:13:37.919 --> 01:13:42.623
[stammers]
philosophical fellows,
like Plato or Socrates.

01:13:42.657 --> 01:13:45.726
My cousin going as
one of the deepest thinkers
in history.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.561
That does quite
boggle the mind.

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:48.996
[all laugh]

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:52.166
So will you go
as Selene?

01:13:52.199 --> 01:13:55.536
I have no objection
masquerading as a goddess.

01:13:57.972 --> 01:13:59.640
Who is this Selene?

01:13:59.674 --> 01:14:01.509
Selene was
the goddess of the moon,

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:03.544
which she drove across
the sky every night.

01:14:03.577 --> 01:14:06.479
The story goes that
she fell in love
with a mere mortal

01:14:06.514 --> 01:14:09.784
who was far beneath her,
both literally
and metaphorically.

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:12.119
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

01:14:12.153 --> 01:14:14.055
I had no idea
military men had such

01:14:14.088 --> 01:14:16.524
an intimate understanding
of mythology.

01:14:16.557 --> 01:14:19.627
Oh, I think there's
quite a lot you don't know
about military men.

01:14:22.697 --> 01:14:26.968
Selina, I would be happy
to assist you
with your costume.

01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:30.204
I could take some designs
to my dressmaker
when I head into town.

01:14:31.605 --> 01:14:33.941
Why, thank you, Julia.
Mmm.

01:14:35.843 --> 01:14:38.946
Right.
Miss Thistlewaite,
let's shoot something.

01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:45.052
[sighs] If we must.

01:14:46.687 --> 01:14:48.289
Gentlemen.

01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:52.793
Now, the trick is
keep the stock tight
to your chest

01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:56.263
and shoot where the bird
will be rather than
where it is. All right?

01:14:56.297 --> 01:14:58.566
[clears throat]

01:14:58.599 --> 01:14:59.700
[Ossory] Thank you, sir.

01:15:02.303 --> 01:15:04.972
[birds squawking]

01:15:05.006 --> 01:15:06.607
[gun cocks]
[grunts]

01:15:09.143 --> 01:15:11.712
[bird squawks]
[wings flapping]

01:15:11.746 --> 01:15:13.948
-[Ossory laughs]
-[dog barks]

01:15:13.981 --> 01:15:16.717
Hmm. I think I've got it.

01:15:18.652 --> 01:15:20.755
I've never seen
a woman do that before.

01:15:20.788 --> 01:15:23.224
I suppose
that's a compliment.

01:15:23.257 --> 01:15:24.825
It most certainly is,
yes.

01:15:31.732 --> 01:15:32.900
[bird squawks]

01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:36.670
[dog barks]
[Ossory laughs]

01:15:43.044 --> 01:15:44.745
[chattering, laughing]

01:15:52.053 --> 01:15:55.790
Mr. Dalton,
is that really the best
you could have done?

01:16:00.194 --> 01:16:02.263
Oh, Mr. Malcolm,

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:07.168
what a pleasure
to be invited to
your very impressive home.

01:16:07.201 --> 01:16:10.704
You must be very thirsty,
Mrs. Covington. Allow me
to escort you to get some punch.

01:16:10.738 --> 01:16:13.941
How gracious, Mr. Malcolm.

01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:16.911
You, the host.

01:16:16.944 --> 01:16:19.914
I knew what they said
about him couldn't be true.

01:16:19.947 --> 01:16:21.849
Shall we?
Oh, yes.

01:16:21.882 --> 01:16:23.050
Mother.

01:16:24.051 --> 01:16:25.920
[Mrs. Covington laughs]

01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:29.690
Oh.

01:16:34.862 --> 01:16:36.730
Cassie.
Yes.

01:16:36.764 --> 01:16:38.232
I must speak with you.

01:16:38.265 --> 01:16:40.367
You know, Julia,
I must say,

01:16:40.401 --> 01:16:43.104
I don't know why
ladies complain about having
to wear feminine attire.

01:16:43.137 --> 01:16:44.405
This is quite
a bit more comfortable

01:16:44.438 --> 01:16:46.207
than knee breeches,
I can tell you.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.642
When I walk,
there's the most
refreshing breeze.

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:52.813
Cousin, I did not come here
to discuss the benefits
of wearing a dress.

01:16:52.847 --> 01:16:54.081
It's not a dress.

01:16:56.183 --> 01:16:59.186
I need to talk to you
about Selina and Malcolm.

01:17:00.988 --> 01:17:03.858
Ah. I see.

01:17:03.891 --> 01:17:05.359
You've finally caught on
to the fact

01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:07.161
that all your scheming
was for nothing.

01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.397
Well, I knew that
all along.

01:17:10.431 --> 01:17:12.766
I knew they were
perfectly suited
to each other.

01:17:14.168 --> 01:17:17.304
I imagine that must sting
just a little bit.

01:17:17.338 --> 01:17:19.740
You thought
to humiliate Malcolm,

01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:22.943
and you end up presenting him
with the perfect wife
on a silver platter.

01:17:27.448 --> 01:17:28.816
A pirate!

01:17:28.849 --> 01:17:31.652
You know, Julia,
you and Malcolm...

01:17:33.254 --> 01:17:35.322
you're much more alike
than you've considered.

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:38.826
You really shouldn't be
so damned picky,

01:17:38.859 --> 01:17:41.095
or you might
miss your chance.

01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:42.129
Boop!

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.269
I'm going to go.

01:17:48.302 --> 01:17:51.438
Well, I almost didn't
recognize you there,
Miss Thistlewaite.

01:17:51.472 --> 01:17:53.974
Captain Ossory,
is that you?

01:17:54.008 --> 01:17:55.943
Your costume is
very out of character.

01:17:55.976 --> 01:17:57.745
I'm not sure
how to take that remark.

01:17:57.778 --> 01:18:01.315
Do you find me
dull and spiritless,

01:18:01.348 --> 01:18:04.985
not manly enough
for swashbuckling adventure?

01:18:05.019 --> 01:18:07.188
[scoffs] No.

01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:10.424
No,
I find you quite manly.

01:18:12.826 --> 01:18:16.497
I'm not entirely sure
how we strayed onto
that topic.

01:18:16.531 --> 01:18:18.399
[laughs]

01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:20.734
The fault
is entirely mine,

01:18:20.768 --> 01:18:24.205
though I cannot regret
the unintentional compliment
you gave me.

01:18:24.238 --> 01:18:26.440
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare your wigs

01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:28.209
and hoist your dresses...

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:30.911
Shall we?
...for the quadrille.

01:18:30.945 --> 01:18:33.347
[guests applauding]

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.450
Which is quite nice.
It's just a bit
of fabric really.

01:18:36.483 --> 01:18:40.421
[guest] Julia Thistlewaite
dancing with a military man?
Well, I never!

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:45.159
[orchestra playing quadrille]

01:18:50.364 --> 01:18:54.335
By the way,
it's me, John.

01:18:54.368 --> 01:18:56.470
[Molly] Well, she's quite taken
by him, isn't she?

01:19:01.342 --> 01:19:02.510
Finally.

01:19:04.278 --> 01:19:06.947
My daughter, dancing
with the captain?

01:19:06.981 --> 01:19:08.949
That is joyous.

01:19:15.823 --> 01:19:19.460
[all exclaiming]

01:19:19.493 --> 01:19:21.462
Mother,
have you seen Selina?

01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:25.099
Well, it's not
the easiest of tasks
this evening, dear.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:32.406
[music stops]
[guests applauding]

01:19:42.916 --> 01:19:45.119
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, the waltz.

01:19:46.387 --> 01:19:49.256
May I, a mere mortal,

01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:51.825
beg of the goddess Selene
the honor of this dance?

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.061
You may.

01:20:03.304 --> 01:20:06.173
[orchestra playing waltz]

01:20:10.144 --> 01:20:11.879
[guest 1] Her mask,
isn't that wonderful?

01:20:11.912 --> 01:20:14.281
[guest 2]
That's Selina Dalton.
[guest 3] Oh, my.

01:20:14.315 --> 01:20:16.850
She is quite beautiful.

01:20:16.884 --> 01:20:19.420
[Lucy] Mr. Malcolm is dancing.

01:20:19.453 --> 01:20:21.623
[Lady Margaret] Is that
Julia Thistlewaite's friend?

01:20:21.656 --> 01:20:23.857
She's a complete nonentity.

01:20:23.891 --> 01:20:26.226
Her father is
a country vicar.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:28.530
Well, he told me
he couldn't dance.

01:20:34.468 --> 01:20:37.204
Mr. Dalton, look.

01:20:43.043 --> 01:20:44.445
[chuckles]

01:20:47.081 --> 01:20:49.249
[chuckles]
Oh!

01:20:49.283 --> 01:20:51.185
[laughs]

01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:53.120
Well, hello, sir.
[giggles]

01:20:54.922 --> 01:20:57.291
Well, it appears
there may be
wedding bells soon.

01:21:06.467 --> 01:21:08.969
Thank you for the company,
but I really must go.

01:21:09.002 --> 01:21:10.170
Wait, Ju--

01:21:11.338 --> 01:21:12.873
Julia.

01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:23.645
Selina, I--

01:22:23.678 --> 01:22:25.279
Miss Dalton!

01:22:25.312 --> 01:22:27.014
Miss Thistlewaite
needs you immediately.

01:22:27.549 --> 01:22:29.349
Come.

01:22:29.383 --> 01:22:31.586
Mr. Malcolm,
please excuse me.

01:22:31.619 --> 01:22:33.353
What is it?
[Molly whimpers]

01:22:43.464 --> 01:22:45.299
Molly,
where are you taking me?

01:22:45.332 --> 01:22:47.569
She is just
through here, Miss.

01:22:51.405 --> 01:22:52.507
[door closes]

01:22:56.678 --> 01:22:57.745
Molly!

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.481
Molly!

01:23:12.326 --> 01:23:14.562
For Mr. Malcolm.

01:23:14.596 --> 01:23:16.531
[Ossory]
She's too good for you,
you know.

01:23:16.564 --> 01:23:18.700
[Malcolm]
That I believe wholeheartedly.

01:23:18.733 --> 01:23:20.735
Thank you, Reeves.

01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:30.244
I have an appointment
in my study
with a certain lady.

01:23:31.178 --> 01:23:32.747
Wish me luck, old boy.

01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:35.048
Next time you see me,
hopefully I'll be betrothed.

01:23:35.082 --> 01:23:37.819
I would wish you luck,
but I don't think
you'll need it.

01:23:37.852 --> 01:23:40.588
Well, you cast your eye.
The night is young.

01:23:50.832 --> 01:23:52.032
Julia!

01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:08.550
[door closes]

01:24:13.353 --> 01:24:15.255
This reminds me
of our first meeting.

01:24:16.591 --> 01:24:18.392
Do you remember
what you said to me?

01:24:19.861 --> 01:24:23.497
I said I thought
hope a futile thing,

01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:25.065
and you disagreed with me.

01:24:26.868 --> 01:24:32.172
Yet you said you hoped
I obtained what
I was looking for.

01:24:34.274 --> 01:24:38.713
You had little idea
the thing I was looking for

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.617
was you.

01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:46.219
I wanted to wait,
at least until the end
of the house party.

01:24:46.253 --> 01:24:49.423
But I do not think I could be
any more convinced

01:24:49.456 --> 01:24:51.158
than I am right now.

01:24:54.361 --> 01:24:55.697
Selina...

01:24:57.699 --> 01:25:01.335
would you do me the great honor
of becoming my wife?

01:25:02.804 --> 01:25:04.237
What's this?

01:25:05.873 --> 01:25:08.275
"Qualifications for a husband.

01:25:08.308 --> 01:25:12.346
Does not make others feel
as if they cannot live up
to an impossible standard."

01:25:13.246 --> 01:25:14.749
No, Selina.

01:25:14.782 --> 01:25:16.416
Selina, wait!

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:17.451
Selina!

01:25:22.489 --> 01:25:24.525
[door rattles, opens]

01:25:24.559 --> 01:25:25.760
Julia!

01:25:25.793 --> 01:25:27.729
[chattering, laughing]

01:25:29.897 --> 01:25:32.867
Selina, aren't you
supposed to be
in the study?

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.669
What?

01:25:34.702 --> 01:25:36.904
With Malcolm.
He said he was
meeting you there.

01:25:36.938 --> 01:25:39.139
I made no appointment
with Mr. Malcolm.

01:25:42.342 --> 01:25:43.611
Please excuse me.
Uh...

01:25:44.912 --> 01:25:46.714
Is everything all right?

01:25:46.748 --> 01:25:47.782
I don't know.

01:25:50.952 --> 01:25:52.152
Julia!

01:25:57.892 --> 01:26:00.928
What-- What is
the meaning of this?

01:26:00.962 --> 01:26:02.329
[Malcolm] Selina, wait!

01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:09.436
Wh-What's this?

01:26:09.469 --> 01:26:11.873
I think you'd
best explain yourself, Julia.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.274
Miss Thistlewaite?

01:26:15.677 --> 01:26:17.779
So it was you who refused
my offer just now.

01:26:17.812 --> 01:26:18.880
Offer?

01:26:21.783 --> 01:26:22.784
Well?

01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:25.318
It's his own fault.

01:26:27.989 --> 01:26:32.794
You spurned me publicly.

01:26:32.827 --> 01:26:37.598
All because I didn't meet
a qualification
on that cruel list of yours.

01:26:40.935 --> 01:26:43.705
So yes,
I decided to show you

01:26:43.738 --> 01:26:46.908
what it feels like
to be judged
and found wanting.

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:51.344
Can you blame me
for enlisting Selina
in the--

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:53.346
Selina?
[laughs]

01:26:56.050 --> 01:26:58.986
Don't tell me you had
a part to play in this?

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:01.522
Julia mentioned it
to me.

01:27:01.556 --> 01:27:03.558
But you cannot think I--
Please.

01:27:03.591 --> 01:27:05.827
The time for pretense
is over.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.863
I never engaged
in any pretense.

01:27:08.896 --> 01:27:12.299
So you did not lie to me
and tell me Mrs. Covington
was not your cousin?

01:27:12.332 --> 01:27:14.535
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cotillion.

01:27:14.569 --> 01:27:17.739
Good God,
what a fool I have been.

01:27:17.772 --> 01:27:20.273
[orchestra playing cotillion]
I should have known
from then.

01:27:22.977 --> 01:27:24.344
J-Jeremy.

01:27:24.377 --> 01:27:26.981
You will call me
Mr. Malcolm.

01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:32.987
M-Mr. Malcolm,
please hear me out
before you condemn me.

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:36.423
And how can I believe
a word you say?

01:27:36.456 --> 01:27:38.760
It seems you have been
deceiving me
from the beginning.

01:27:38.793 --> 01:27:40.962
Malcolm, perhaps you should
listen to what
she has to say.

01:27:40.995 --> 01:27:43.296
I hardly think you're
the appropriate person
to counsel me.

01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:45.032
It's obvious they've
beguiled you as well.

01:27:46.667 --> 01:27:48.636
[guests exclaiming]
[music continues playing]

01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:52.439
If you will excuse me,
I am in the middle
of hosting a ball.

01:27:53.608 --> 01:27:55.676
A masquerade,
ironically.

01:28:01.682 --> 01:28:05.352
Do you see?
Do you see now
how arrogant he is?

01:28:05.385 --> 01:28:07.021
How could you stand there
and say nothing?

01:28:08.856 --> 01:28:11.759
Well, if you're wondering
whether to lock me in my room,

01:28:11.793 --> 01:28:15.362
I can assure you,
I do not intend
on coming down again tonight.

01:28:15.395 --> 01:28:16.764
Selina--
Don't bother.

01:28:21.035 --> 01:28:24.038
Are you satisfied
with your behavior, Julia?

01:28:25.106 --> 01:28:26.774
Course not.

01:28:28.943 --> 01:28:31.311
Oh, I feel like
I'm going to be sick.

01:28:35.082 --> 01:28:37.450
I think it's best
I return to the ballroom.

01:28:47.427 --> 01:28:49.530
[sighs, sniffs]

01:28:53.534 --> 01:28:56.571
[music stops]
[guests applauding]

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.976
[crying]

01:29:17.424 --> 01:29:19.492
[Molly]
Your shoulders down.

01:29:19.527 --> 01:29:22.495
[Molly chuckles]
Stop standing on my feet.

01:29:25.498 --> 01:29:27.501
[quacking]

01:29:30.504 --> 01:29:32.940
[Mr. Dalton] You disappeared
early last night.

01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:34.575
[Selina] Did I?

01:29:38.478 --> 01:29:40.514
You know, Selina,

01:29:40.548 --> 01:29:43.684
though Mr. Malcolm,
from what acquaintance
I have made of him,

01:29:43.718 --> 01:29:44.752
appears true of heart,

01:29:46.654 --> 01:29:51.659
he is nevertheless
from an altogether
different sphere.

01:29:53.995 --> 01:29:58.431
This decision
I have come to believe
you are making,

01:29:58.465 --> 01:30:02.169
we want you to know
that it's yours and yours alone.

01:30:02.203 --> 01:30:08.843
And even if you and Mr. Malcolm
should decide not to make
a match of it,

01:30:08.876 --> 01:30:13.514
well, it's been nice
to have had a little holiday.

01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:16.684
Papa.

01:30:25.226 --> 01:30:26.493
[sighs]

01:30:29.263 --> 01:30:30.898
I'll leave you
to your thoughts.

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.928
Though it pains me
to admit it,

01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:06.534
I have to concede
that you were right,

01:31:06.567 --> 01:31:07.735
and I was...

01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:11.138
not entirely right.

01:31:12.707 --> 01:31:14.875
[Reeves] That should
do the trick, sir.

01:31:14.909 --> 01:31:15.876
Thank you.

01:31:16.844 --> 01:31:18.646
Oh, we must do something.

01:31:18.679 --> 01:31:21.882
[groans]
I think that's how
this whole debacle began.

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:24.085
Captain Ossory,

01:31:24.118 --> 01:31:28.589
what if you were to pretend
to woo Selina?

01:31:28.622 --> 01:31:32.893
I think Malcolm
was jealous of you before.
It might work again.

01:31:32.927 --> 01:31:36.230
I don't think so.
I prefer to let them
work out matters for themselves.

01:31:36.263 --> 01:31:39.266
Well, they don't appear to be
doing a very good job of it.

01:31:40.968 --> 01:31:43.637
Malcolm has all but disappeared
since last night.

01:31:45.339 --> 01:31:47.274
Cassie?
Hmm?

01:31:47.308 --> 01:31:49.677
Would you give us
a moment, please?

01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:51.746
Yes, of course.

01:31:51.779 --> 01:31:53.948
I really should check
where Malcolm is anyway.

01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:56.217
[groans]

01:31:58.986 --> 01:32:02.923
Captain Ossory,
it's all perfectly harmless.

01:32:05.026 --> 01:32:09.663
I just want to ensure
that Malcolm values Selina
as he should.

01:32:09.697 --> 01:32:11.332
Hmm.

01:32:11.365 --> 01:32:14.735
I think there have been
enough silly schemes.

01:32:14.769 --> 01:32:16.237
Don't you think,
Miss Thistlewaite?

01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:19.106
But you wouldn't even
have to do anything.

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:22.710
Although it might be a good idea
if you did pay Selina
a little extra attention.

01:32:22.743 --> 01:32:24.879
I refuse to pretend
an attraction I do not feel

01:32:24.912 --> 01:32:27.314
and stand by
and let you ignore
the one that I do feel.

01:32:27.348 --> 01:32:33.654
But you came to London
to make a match with Selina.

01:32:33.687 --> 01:32:36.924
So now I'm not
even allowed to decide
to whom I'm attracted?

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:43.064
Does this feel as though
I'm attracted to Miss Dalton?

01:32:52.773 --> 01:32:53.542
Well?

01:32:55.009 --> 01:32:58.212
I may not be a lord
or an honorable,

01:32:58.245 --> 01:33:00.948
but I'm falling in love
with you, Julia.

01:33:00.981 --> 01:33:02.983
And I plan on devoting
the rest of my life

01:33:03.017 --> 01:33:06.754
to keeping those
nasty habits of yours
in check.

01:33:06.787 --> 01:33:08.255
[both laugh]

01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:11.892
In fact, I positively
look forward to it.

01:33:14.829 --> 01:33:16.197
Oh, Henry.

01:33:41.188 --> 01:33:43.290
[neighs]
Shh.

01:33:47.895 --> 01:33:50.831
Jeremy,
could we speak outside?

01:33:50.865 --> 01:33:52.333
You know
I don't like horses.

01:33:54.368 --> 01:33:58.139
You have some nerve,
after the trick
you all played on me.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.841
I was helping you.

01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:04.245
If only you had
the wit to see it.

01:34:05.913 --> 01:34:08.449
'Tis true that Julia wanted
to humiliate you.

01:34:08.482 --> 01:34:10.985
I, on the other hand,
I knew Miss Dalton
was perfect for you

01:34:11.018 --> 01:34:12.686
from the very beginning.

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:15.156
Whether you thought
you were helping me or not,

01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:17.958
Miss Dalton used information
she obtained from you

01:34:17.992 --> 01:34:21.295
about what I was looking for
in a wife to become that woman.

01:34:21.328 --> 01:34:23.998
I have absolutely no idea
who she actually is!

01:34:24.031 --> 01:34:27.034
That is simply not true.

01:34:27.067 --> 01:34:30.938
She barely paid any attention
to anything that we said.

01:34:30.971 --> 01:34:34.775
[stammers] Well, except the--
the musical talent part.

01:34:34.808 --> 01:34:36.310
That she had to fake.

01:34:36.343 --> 01:34:39.813
My point is,
if she had listened to us,

01:34:39.847 --> 01:34:43.217
she probably wouldn't have
attracted your notice at all.

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:45.953
So what you're saying is
she's smarter than you
and Julia?

01:34:45.986 --> 01:34:48.255
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

01:34:48.289 --> 01:34:50.791
She is most likely smarter
than Julia or I--

01:34:50.824 --> 01:34:52.259
For Christ's sake,
Cassie!

01:34:52.293 --> 01:34:53.928
Dash it,
you're twisting my words.

01:34:53.961 --> 01:34:57.765
What I'm trying to say,
Jeremy, is that if--

01:34:57.798 --> 01:35:00.768
Selina Dalton
is the right woman for you,

01:35:00.801 --> 01:35:03.237
and if you ruin this,
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:05.406
If I ruin this?

01:35:05.439 --> 01:35:07.808
Well, Lord Cassidy,
I appreciate your concern.

01:35:07.841 --> 01:35:10.044
However, nowhere on
my now-infamous list

01:35:10.077 --> 01:35:12.913
does it specify deception,
lying or scheming.

01:35:12.947 --> 01:35:15.015
I am no longer interested
in Miss Dalton

01:35:15.049 --> 01:35:17.384
and can only regret
that I fell foul
of her little game.

01:35:17.418 --> 01:35:19.320
Now,
if you will excuse me.

01:35:24.191 --> 01:35:25.459
[exhales]

01:35:30.798 --> 01:35:32.032
[knocking]

01:36:29.123 --> 01:36:31.225
I suppose I have you
to thank for this?

01:36:32.359 --> 01:36:33.127
I beg your pardon?

01:36:35.095 --> 01:36:39.233
If you had thought
to orchestrate
a compromising situation,

01:36:39.266 --> 01:36:42.836
I must admit, I had
thought you a great deal
cleverer than this.

01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:47.107
I received an invitation
to tour the gardens.

01:36:47.141 --> 01:36:49.376
I assumed it to be
a group tour.

01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:52.179
I certainly did not plan
on meeting you here alone.

01:36:52.212 --> 01:36:54.882
I suppose it's coincidence
then that I too
received a note,

01:36:54.915 --> 01:36:57.418
though mine spouted
some nonsense about

01:36:57.451 --> 01:37:00.020
"a discussion that promises
great future benefit."

01:37:02.489 --> 01:37:05.159
It's all very melodramatic,
now I think on it.

01:37:06.427 --> 01:37:08.996
You are to be commended,
Miss Dalton.

01:37:09.029 --> 01:37:13.133
I have avoided
a great number of attempts
to entrap me in matrimony,

01:37:13.167 --> 01:37:15.436
but never have
I met someone whose methods

01:37:15.469 --> 01:37:19.273
are so obviously
contrived as you.

01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:27.147
You insufferable,
arrogant,

01:37:27.181 --> 01:37:29.283
conceited coxcomb.

01:37:29.316 --> 01:37:35.022
I would never be content
to marry a man who holds
such a low opinion of me.

01:37:35.055 --> 01:37:38.025
Well, this is a good thing
there has been
no such engagement.

01:37:48.503 --> 01:37:52.206
I now wish I had taken
a more enthusiastic part

01:37:52.239 --> 01:37:54.542
in Julia's despicable scheme
to humble you,

01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:58.979
although I realize now
it would have never worked.

01:38:01.215 --> 01:38:04.586
She expected you
to fall in love with me.

01:38:06.019 --> 01:38:07.354
I have since learned
that you--

01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:10.991
that you are
incapable of love, sir.

01:38:14.194 --> 01:38:16.029
Though perhaps
we're all better for it

01:38:17.498 --> 01:38:19.400
because you're not
worthy of it, either.

01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:25.205
Goodbye, Mr. Malcolm.

01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:29.176
I wish you and your list
all the happiness in the world.

01:38:31.078 --> 01:38:32.279
Miss Dalton!

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:47.695
[knocking]

01:38:49.263 --> 01:38:50.632
Selina.

01:38:50.665 --> 01:38:51.699
Go away.

01:38:56.069 --> 01:38:58.506
You have every right
to despise me.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.073
I despise myself.

01:39:02.075 --> 01:39:04.978
-Good.
-I deserve that.

01:39:05.012 --> 01:39:09.684
Selina, I don't know why
I went through with it.

01:39:12.119 --> 01:39:16.256
Initially,
I wanted revenge
on Mr. Malcolm.

01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:20.595
I was so angry that one man
could turn my entire life
into a farce.

01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:23.731
But then I did want

01:39:23.765 --> 01:39:27.000
to ruin your chances
with him as well.

01:39:28.736 --> 01:39:29.970
Selina.

01:39:32.607 --> 01:39:35.209
We both had the dream
of marrying for love.

01:39:36.778 --> 01:39:40.247
And after all
of my failed seasons,
I...

01:39:41.516 --> 01:39:43.016
I gave up hope.

01:39:46.654 --> 01:39:49.524
You captured Malcolm's heart
without even trying.

01:39:53.193 --> 01:39:55.496
And I was
so jealous of you.

01:39:58.666 --> 01:40:02.637
I couldn't bear
to see you succeeding
where I had failed.

01:40:03.805 --> 01:40:05.573
It all seems
so silly now.

01:40:07.107 --> 01:40:09.309
If I had just stopped,
I would have seen

01:40:10.812 --> 01:40:13.413
that the only person
I was failing is you.

01:40:14.816 --> 01:40:18.018
Selina, do you think
that you can forgive me?

01:40:25.425 --> 01:40:26.426
[sighs]

01:40:29.096 --> 01:40:30.832
Please,
please don't go.

01:40:30.865 --> 01:40:33.433
We must reconcile you
with Malcolm.

01:40:33.467 --> 01:40:37.204
I think you might have been
more correct in your reading
of Mr. Malcolm than I was.

01:40:37.237 --> 01:40:39.641
That is very noble
of you, Selina.

01:40:41.375 --> 01:40:44.077
But is this
what you really want?

01:40:51.451 --> 01:40:54.288
I will have John
prepare my carriage for you.

01:40:58.325 --> 01:40:59.393
Thank you.

01:41:06.133 --> 01:41:07.769
Julia.
Yes?

01:41:11.573 --> 01:41:13.808
I do want to thank you
before I leave.

01:41:15.643 --> 01:41:18.746
Had it not been for your--
for your scheme,

01:41:20.915 --> 01:41:24.552
I would have never experienced
what it feels like
to fall in love...

01:41:26.754 --> 01:41:29.323
and that alone
makes me very content.

01:41:35.195 --> 01:41:36.664
I'm happy for you.

01:41:38.265 --> 01:41:39.734
What do you mean?

01:41:40.835 --> 01:41:44.237
Henry.
He's a good man.

01:41:45.907 --> 01:41:47.341
How did you know?

01:41:48.776 --> 01:41:50.210
Cassie, of course.

01:41:52.346 --> 01:41:56.116
I would have never expected
to fall in love
with someone like Henry.

01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:58.753
He's just so...

01:42:02.356 --> 01:42:03.423
nice.

01:42:04.926 --> 01:42:06.527
Now, Julia,

01:42:07.695 --> 01:42:10.364
do not be
such a namby-pamby.

01:42:47.902 --> 01:42:48.936
[John] Move on.

01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:51.405
[carriage departing]

01:42:59.379 --> 01:43:03.216
You do not look like
a man who has just
become happily engaged.

01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:05.853
That's because
I'm not happily engaged.

01:43:05.887 --> 01:43:06.854
Miss Dalton has left.

01:43:08.455 --> 01:43:11.291
You have ruined things,
haven't you?

01:43:11.324 --> 01:43:13.695
And after all my efforts.

01:43:16.798 --> 01:43:18.633
What--
What did you just say?

01:43:18.666 --> 01:43:23.270
I am saying that I arranged
for a tour of the rose garden

01:43:23.303 --> 01:43:24.605
at three o'clock.

01:43:24.639 --> 01:43:27.307
I assumed it would give
the two of you

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.511
enough time alone together
to come to some sort
of betrothal.

01:43:30.545 --> 01:43:31.411
Why did you--

01:43:32.747 --> 01:43:34.749
Why did you not tell me
this earlier?

01:43:34.782 --> 01:43:38.686
If I had known you were
in such a great hurry
to bungle things,

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.557
you can be assured
I would not have exercised
such forbearance.

01:43:43.891 --> 01:43:46.761
What did you do
to upset Miss Dalton so?

01:43:46.794 --> 01:43:50.898
Nothing so serious. I merely
accused her of attempting
to entrap me in marriage.

01:43:50.932 --> 01:43:53.701
I must say,
Jeremiah,

01:43:53.735 --> 01:43:56.637
I am quite
disappointed in you.

01:43:56.671 --> 01:44:00.742
Mother--
I am well aware
that you have a list.

01:44:00.775 --> 01:44:03.544
When I first learned of it,
I was concerned

01:44:03.578 --> 01:44:06.748
that you had become
arrogant and judgmental.

01:44:06.781 --> 01:44:12.319
But then I came to realize
your list is in the nature
of a shield.

01:44:13.821 --> 01:44:17.290
So many women
have pursued you
for your fortune

01:44:17.324 --> 01:44:21.328
that you did not want to
give your heart to a woman
that might prove unworthy.

01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:27.802
But I have never met
so sincere a lady
as Miss Selina Dalton.

01:44:27.835 --> 01:44:32.405
It is difficult
for you to let someone
past that guard

01:44:32.439 --> 01:44:35.009
that you've placed around
your heart.

01:44:35.042 --> 01:44:40.915
But unless you do,
you're in danger of losing
Miss Dalton's altogether.

01:44:40.948 --> 01:44:44.952
Love cannot be planned
so carefully, my dear.

01:44:44.986 --> 01:44:46.954
It will stir things up
a bit.

01:44:48.055 --> 01:44:50.591
That is part of its charm.

01:44:54.028 --> 01:44:56.063
I have to go after her.

01:44:56.097 --> 01:44:59.066
There's no need
to look so apprehensive.
She will not eat you.

01:45:00.601 --> 01:45:03.403
You've not seen her
in a temper.

01:45:03.436 --> 01:45:04.839
She is a fearsome sight.

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.475
And more beautiful than ever.

01:45:11.478 --> 01:45:13.413
[Cassidy] It's the way
that they look at me.

01:45:13.446 --> 01:45:14.982
This one reminds me
of Great Uncle Vivian.

01:45:15.016 --> 01:45:16.918
Yeah, Julia,
he was killed by a horse.

01:45:21.622 --> 01:45:22.723
Do you know
where she's going?

01:45:24.625 --> 01:45:27.728
She's gone back to Sussex.
Her parents follow tomorrow.

01:45:27.762 --> 01:45:29.063
Thank you.

01:45:29.096 --> 01:45:32.099
And thank you, Cassie.
You were right.

01:45:32.133 --> 01:45:33.534
I was--
I was right?

01:45:33.568 --> 01:45:35.570
Of course
I was right!

01:45:41.676 --> 01:45:42.710
Miss Thistlewaite.

01:45:43.511 --> 01:45:44.979
I am sorry.

01:45:45.012 --> 01:45:46.113
I'm sorry too.

01:45:47.782 --> 01:45:49.650
-Let's go.
-Go, Malcolm. Go!

01:45:49.684 --> 01:45:51.953
Go!
Go, Malcolm!
[laughs]

01:46:30.091 --> 01:46:31.125
Hyah!

01:46:49.543 --> 01:46:51.178
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

01:46:59.253 --> 01:47:00.821
[exclaims]
[whinnies]

01:47:04.491 --> 01:47:07.728
[panting] Are you trying
to get us both killed?

01:47:07.762 --> 01:47:10.531
I realized I forgot
to give you something
before you left.

01:47:13.034 --> 01:47:13.668
What is it?

01:47:15.703 --> 01:47:19.974
[Selina scoffs]
Do not tell me that is
your infamous list.

01:47:20.007 --> 01:47:21.876
No.

01:47:21.909 --> 01:47:24.645
It's a new list
that I just composed.

01:47:27.081 --> 01:47:28.182
Please?

01:47:36.991 --> 01:47:40.628
I would like to offer
an explanation for the
deplorable way I've treated you

01:47:40.661 --> 01:47:43.664
since I found out
Miss Thistlewaite's plot

01:47:43.698 --> 01:47:46.934
and then again
this afternoon
in the rose garden.

01:47:48.970 --> 01:47:51.672
Though it pains me
to admit,

01:47:51.706 --> 01:47:54.909
I was relieved
to find an excuse
to discredit you.

01:47:56.877 --> 01:47:59.046
There is
a certain feeling of...

01:48:00.748 --> 01:48:01.849
insecurity

01:48:03.651 --> 01:48:05.086
when you find yourself
falling in love with someone.

01:48:07.688 --> 01:48:11.859
And I can only hope
that you will forgive me
for being a misguided fool.

01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:15.730
Miss Selina Dalton,

01:48:17.164 --> 01:48:22.269
I have loved you deeply

01:48:22.303 --> 01:48:25.740
from the moment
I saw you in the moonlight
of that orangery.

01:48:27.108 --> 01:48:28.809
You are everything...

01:48:30.211 --> 01:48:32.179
everything I could have
ever hoped for.

01:48:34.048 --> 01:48:37.284
You are
the "chief happiness
this world affords,"

01:48:37.318 --> 01:48:39.286
to misquote Johnson.

01:48:41.622 --> 01:48:43.190
And I would count myself

01:48:43.224 --> 01:48:45.760
the most fortunate
and humble of men

01:48:47.294 --> 01:48:48.896
if you would
be my wife.

01:49:21.095 --> 01:49:22.930
You have yet
to give me an answer.

01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:28.235
Tell me, though...

01:49:30.805 --> 01:49:33.140
what opinion do you hold
on the Corn Laws?

01:49:34.875 --> 01:49:36.343
[laughs]

01:49:36.377 --> 01:49:39.313
Has every stupid thing
I've ever said or done

01:49:39.346 --> 01:49:41.048
been announced
to the entire world?

01:49:42.249 --> 01:49:45.152
Jeremy, of course
I will marry you.
