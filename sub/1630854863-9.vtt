WEBVTT

00:14.909 --> 00:17.567
You're Spyro's
little sister?

00:17.567 --> 00:20.156
I guarantee supply
far better

00:20.156 --> 00:21.674
than anything they
could provide.

00:21.674 --> 00:23.814
Your lot is not
welcome here.

00:23.814 --> 00:25.747
We have to be able
to trust each other.

00:25.747 --> 00:26.714
Yeah, we can.

00:26.714 --> 00:28.750
Look even if I
wanted to help you,

00:28.750 --> 00:30.269
you got the wrong bloke.

00:30.269 --> 00:31.546
I've got nothing on John.

00:31.546 --> 00:32.616
They're saying there
could be a deal now.

00:32.616 --> 00:33.617
You're talking about John.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.860
- Yeah, I know.
- It's John Ibrahim,

00:34.860 --> 00:35.757
my family.

00:35.757 --> 00:36.689
I fucking know that!

00:36.689 --> 00:38.174
Who runs the
protection racket

00:38.174 --> 00:40.141
in Kings Cross, right now?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.316
Used to be Sam who collected
for Nasa, now it's John.

00:42.316 --> 00:44.525
I run a video arcade Mr. Bolt.

00:44.525 --> 00:46.320
Well would you mind
describing for me

00:46.320 --> 00:48.253
exactly what it is
you're doing here then?

00:50.151 --> 00:52.015
Detective Sergeant Crellan

00:52.015 --> 00:53.672
was paid to kill
Nasa Kalouri.

00:55.605 --> 00:58.642
I would suggest that you are
the new lifeblood

00:58.642 --> 01:00.575
of the Kings Cross
drug trade.

01:00.575 --> 01:01.714
But I'm not.

01:01.714 --> 01:05.787
Calling, Mr. Richard
Dickie Needham, please.

01:14.451 --> 01:15.970
I'm sorry.

01:24.013 --> 01:25.738
More than a
hundred mourners gathered today

01:25.738 --> 01:27.809
in the Western Sydney
suburb of Merrylands

01:27.809 --> 01:29.742
to farewell Jamour Ibrahim,

01:29.742 --> 01:33.608
father of Kings Cross
Nightclub King, John Ibrahim.

01:33.608 --> 01:35.783
The cream of Sydney's
underworld turned out

01:35.783 --> 01:37.129
to pay their respects,

01:37.129 --> 01:39.166
attracting a heightened
police presence,

01:39.166 --> 01:41.892
including officers from
the Organised Crime Squad

01:41.892 --> 01:43.618
and the State Protection Group.

01:45.482 --> 01:47.277
Feuds and
turf wars were forgotten

01:47.277 --> 01:49.452
as the mourners
presented their condolences

01:49.452 --> 01:51.281
to the Ibrahim family.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.633
Jamour Ibrahim,
who described himself

01:58.633 --> 02:00.118
as a professional gambler,

02:00.118 --> 02:02.637
had been fighting a
long battle with cancer.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.723
Sorry for your loss.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.690
Thank you.

02:38.052 --> 02:39.329
Hi,

02:39.329 --> 02:40.779
I'm Anastasia.

02:40.779 --> 02:41.780
I'm John's friend.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.195
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:44.369 --> 02:45.508
Sorry for your loss.

02:45.508 --> 02:46.923
Thank you.

02:51.548 --> 02:54.103
Mama, this is Anastasia.

02:54.103 --> 02:55.345
Hi darling.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.106
Thank you for coming.

03:08.393 --> 03:09.221
Hamish.

03:09.221 --> 03:11.258
- Hey.
- Appreciate you coming down.

03:18.196 --> 03:21.302
All of these men,
they come for my sons.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.860
This man,
their father,

03:28.723 --> 03:31.071
he could only ever
dream of such respect.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.670
The Royal Commission

04:18.808 --> 04:21.051
into police corruption
has now wound up.

04:21.051 --> 04:23.019
Dozens of officers
have been stood down

04:23.019 --> 04:24.779
pending further investigation,

04:24.779 --> 04:26.919
and protected witnesses
are in hiding.

04:26.919 --> 04:29.336
And some, like corrupt
Kings Cross Detective,

04:29.336 --> 04:31.890
Sergeant Bryan Crellan,
facing murder charges,

04:31.890 --> 04:34.272
have found
themselves behind bars.

04:34.272 --> 04:37.240
Tragically, 11 police officers
have taken their own lives

04:37.240 --> 04:39.656
rather than face
cross examination.

04:51.806 --> 04:53.912
Any reason for the long face?

04:53.912 --> 04:55.155
Crellan's locked up.

04:55.155 --> 04:57.226
Mooney's on ice,
in witness protection.

04:57.226 --> 04:58.951
We ripped the guts
out of this thing.

05:00.677 --> 05:01.920
Everyone's happy.

05:02.610 --> 05:03.887
You should be out
getting drunk.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.303
You think?

05:05.303 --> 05:06.511
Yeah,

05:06.511 --> 05:07.546
I do.

05:07.546 --> 05:10.170
Just don't stay out too late.

05:11.826 --> 05:13.173
You've got an important
meeting scheduled here

05:13.173 --> 05:14.208
at 9:00 AM tomorrow.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.486
You too, champ.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.696
Big things in store guys.

05:21.077 --> 05:22.734
Big things.

05:37.335 --> 05:39.406
Look,
look at these fuckwits.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.063
I want them all cleared out.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.102
Make sure you take
some boys with you,

05:46.102 --> 05:47.897
if you're going
to be scared.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.639
Sam.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.055
Good to see you back.

06:09.988 --> 06:11.231
Fuck me.

06:11.231 --> 06:13.681
Hey, clean this up
for Sam, yeah.

06:15.752 --> 06:18.203
- Just a coffee, Sam?
- Yeah.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.756
Leave this.

06:20.619 --> 06:22.483
It's a
nice service, Sam.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.727
Yeah. Yeah, you
boys did real good.

06:25.935 --> 06:28.317
How's your mum holding up?
Is she all right?

06:33.874 --> 06:35.393
All right,
you let us know, hey.

06:35.393 --> 06:37.257
- Two, one.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.302
You're at my fucking table.

06:50.304 --> 06:51.236
I'm kidding.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.756
Oi, relax.
Why you so tense?

06:53.756 --> 06:55.930
Fuckwit!

06:56.206 --> 06:58.243
- Hey, look at us.
- Not bad, huh?

06:58.243 --> 06:59.693
You're smiling.

07:44.669 --> 07:47.706
We'll do this outside,
down by the pool.

07:56.474 --> 07:58.959
There's no such thing as
organised crime anymore.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.547
It's just this
disorganised shit

08:00.547 --> 08:01.513
and every rat and dog,

08:01.513 --> 08:03.826
they all want a fucking piece.

08:03.826 --> 08:06.311
That's what we should
be worrying about.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.762
Not what Nasa had,
you know, the good days.

08:08.762 --> 08:10.280
That's over.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.594
Information is the
new currency, not cash,

08:13.594 --> 08:15.596
we can't pay our way
out of trouble anymore.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.322
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

08:18.323 --> 08:20.152
As far as I'm concerned,
we let 'em have it.

08:22.465 --> 08:24.087
Brother,

08:24.087 --> 08:26.435
anyone who runs a business
in the Cross pays protection.

08:26.435 --> 08:27.712
From who?

08:28.920 --> 08:30.404
The clean cops you
can't pay off anymore.

08:30.404 --> 08:32.579
Who are they protecting
themselves from?

08:32.924 --> 08:34.201
From me.

08:34.201 --> 08:35.961
They can protect
themselves from me.

08:37.998 --> 08:43.728
Fuck it, I'll call it the,
um, street tax.

08:56.326 --> 08:57.914
Osmon!

08:57.914 --> 08:59.916
Put Desiree in the pen.

09:01.573 --> 09:03.230
Hey, come here.

09:03.230 --> 09:04.127
All right.

09:04.990 --> 09:05.991
So...

09:05.991 --> 09:09.409
You see Desiree, right?
Desiree's the red one.

09:10.237 --> 09:11.756
There she is.

09:11.756 --> 09:12.619
Right so,

09:12.619 --> 09:13.723
so you got to watch out.

09:13.723 --> 09:17.002
She, with the female, you
got to really watch out,

09:17.002 --> 09:19.971
all right, 'cause they can
get really, really aggressive.

09:19.971 --> 09:23.319
I mean,
in a pecking order,

09:23.319 --> 09:24.251
you've got to be
careful as well

09:24.251 --> 09:25.666
because the more
contained they are,

09:25.666 --> 09:26.874
the more aggressive
they can get.

09:26.874 --> 09:29.463
So, I mean I've seen 'em,

09:29.463 --> 09:32.535
I've seen the females,
like, eat their young.

09:35.124 --> 09:36.746
So, let's do this.

09:43.546 --> 09:45.893
These fucking cockroaches.

09:48.033 --> 09:49.379
You see what happens when
I'm gone five minutes,

09:49.379 --> 09:50.760
they're fucking everywhere.

09:52.279 --> 09:53.245
So what?

09:53.729 --> 09:55.075
You want what Joey had?

09:55.075 --> 09:57.077
Because he's doing
fucking 16 years now.

09:58.941 --> 10:02.289
Sam, I own four clubs,
plus we're making triple

10:02.289 --> 10:03.635
off all the other venues
we're looking after.

10:03.635 --> 10:04.912
That is ours.

10:06.155 --> 10:07.397
It's legitimate.

10:09.261 --> 10:10.918
This is still my street.

10:10.918 --> 10:11.816
That's what I'm about.

10:11.816 --> 10:12.920
Yeah,

10:12.920 --> 10:14.474
I know.

10:14.474 --> 10:16.441
I just want you to
come in with me.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.754
Work with me.

10:18.754 --> 10:19.927
What?

10:19.927 --> 10:21.515
Running clubs, hanging
out with celebrities

10:21.515 --> 10:22.689
like a fucking wanker.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.173
No.

10:24.173 --> 10:25.554
Come on man,

10:25.554 --> 10:26.831
it's all you.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.766
I want something for
me like, respect.

10:30.766 --> 10:32.250
Sam, fuck the street.

10:33.941 --> 10:35.287
Let 'em have it.

10:36.254 --> 10:39.222
Because in six months
they'll either be dead or gone.

10:39.844 --> 10:42.398
I need us to work
together on this.

10:42.398 --> 10:43.813
'Cause how we play
it out from here

10:43.813 --> 10:45.988
is really fucking important.

10:45.988 --> 10:47.610
Not just for us,

10:48.059 --> 10:49.336
for Mum.

10:53.443 --> 10:55.411
I need you to set
me up someplace.

10:56.516 --> 10:58.000
I need a base.

10:59.139 --> 11:00.554
Somewhere right here.

11:03.695 --> 11:04.800
Yeah, I can do that.

11:12.842 --> 11:13.947
You know
the great irony of the

11:13.947 --> 11:14.913
Royal Commission is?

11:14.913 --> 11:16.363
What's that?

11:17.122 --> 11:19.331
It's put Kings Cross
on the map.

11:19.331 --> 11:22.576
And now you've given every
Viet gangster on the strip,

11:22.576 --> 11:23.508
the green light.

11:23.681 --> 11:25.752
Yeah I know, but look
what we've fucking done.

11:25.752 --> 11:26.684
I mean,

11:26.787 --> 11:28.789
all we got to do is sit back
and you know,

11:28.789 --> 11:31.136
they pay up and we're
laughing, aren't we?

11:31.136 --> 11:32.103
And the Ibrahims?

11:32.103 --> 11:33.829
You think they're just
going to sit back?

11:35.209 --> 11:37.349
Well, John just wants his
fucking clubs, don't he?

11:37.349 --> 11:38.627
And then Sam,

11:38.627 --> 11:40.801
he couldn't organise a
piss-up in a brewery.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.009
I mean,

11:43.321 --> 11:44.564
we're laughing.

11:46.669 --> 11:48.637
I think Yael's right.

11:48.637 --> 11:51.018
I really think we need to
get John on board with this.

11:51.018 --> 11:51.950
Why?

11:51.950 --> 11:55.436
He's a celebrity now, right?

11:55.436 --> 11:56.955
He's a rockstar,
he's just walking around

11:56.955 --> 11:58.888
with a big fucking
target on his back.

11:59.889 --> 12:01.339
They got him cornered.

12:01.339 --> 12:03.134
And you think
that's a good thing?

12:06.586 --> 12:09.174
We might have
just started a war.

12:14.628 --> 12:17.010
Cemeteries kind
of creep me out.

12:17.010 --> 12:20.013
You know, Rookwood,
it's so old.

12:20.876 --> 12:21.773
And it's funny,

12:21.946 --> 12:25.259
we used to live so close by
when we were kids.

12:25.259 --> 12:27.330
We used to go all the time.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.574
You know, me, Spyro and
our little cousin Linus.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.610
Yeah.

12:30.886 --> 12:34.510
We had this game that we try
and find the oldest headstone.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.270
They were right back
to the First Fleet.

12:36.270 --> 12:37.547
Did you know that?

12:39.515 --> 12:40.965
Yeah, you can still find them.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.350
Anyways.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.904
I don't like crypts.

12:48.904 --> 12:50.560
I mean, if I had a choice,
I'd be cremated,

12:50.560 --> 12:52.355
because fuck sticking me
in a concrete box

12:52.355 --> 12:53.460
with my whole family.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.024
How well did you know him?

13:09.027 --> 13:10.201
My brother.

13:16.207 --> 13:17.035
Ah.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.280
I don't know.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.524
I thought we
talked about this.

13:24.525 --> 13:25.561
He was around,

13:26.838 --> 13:28.115
different crews.

13:29.979 --> 13:32.637
He was always really
friendly with me.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.679
Fucking drugs.

14:04.911 --> 14:05.705
You're serious?

14:05.843 --> 14:07.568
You want Sam to set up
in Stripperama?

14:07.568 --> 14:10.123
Just give him access
to the bottom bar.

14:10.123 --> 14:11.538
One of your own girls
on the books.

14:11.538 --> 14:12.988
Dion will handle security.

14:12.988 --> 14:14.334
Nothing else changes,
all right.

14:14.334 --> 14:17.406
You just, treat everything
like normal.

14:19.546 --> 14:22.618
He'll kill us.
I know it, but,

14:22.618 --> 14:25.414
six months,
we'll see what happens.

14:25.414 --> 14:27.796
They're fucking animals John,

14:27.796 --> 14:29.418
him and his bikie mates.

14:30.281 --> 14:31.144
If you want to move on,

14:31.144 --> 14:33.008
I can set you up
someplace else.

14:34.768 --> 14:36.701
I need to keep Sam contained.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.530
The place would burn to
the ground without me,

14:38.530 --> 14:39.877
and you know it.

14:40.809 --> 14:41.879
But I want a raise.

15:05.557 --> 15:06.973
John.

15:08.319 --> 15:10.183
Sorry to interrupt.

15:10.183 --> 15:12.633
Just thought it was about
time I bought you a drink.

15:14.566 --> 15:15.395
Uh-huh.

15:17.293 --> 15:18.605
Where's Chuckles?

15:19.606 --> 15:21.056
Or you here to honey trap me?

15:22.195 --> 15:25.854
He's gone home for the weekend
and I am celebrating.

15:25.854 --> 15:27.579
I just got promoted.

15:29.271 --> 15:30.859
Lucky me.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.038
A brand new task force.

15:38.936 --> 15:40.247
Good for you.

15:40.627 --> 15:41.628
Tasked with what?

15:41.628 --> 15:42.905
Here you go, John.

15:43.457 --> 15:46.150
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

15:46.150 --> 15:49.256
We're sweeping up the garbage
the Royal Commission missed,

15:49.256 --> 15:50.637
the ones who got away.

15:50.637 --> 15:51.949
We?

15:53.674 --> 15:54.675
Yeah, me and Luke.

15:55.918 --> 15:57.402
A small handpicked team.

15:57.402 --> 15:59.163
Oh, good for Mary.

15:59.163 --> 16:01.441
Well we're after
the big dogs John,

16:01.441 --> 16:03.719
facilitators,
the enablers.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.345
Why are you here, Doyle?

16:13.522 --> 16:15.075
Look I,

16:16.318 --> 16:17.940
I wanted to say
I was very sorry

16:17.940 --> 16:20.115
about what happened
to your friend,

16:20.115 --> 16:21.633
Dave Campbell.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.602
I guess we don't always
appreciate the pressures

16:24.602 --> 16:25.983
that some people
might be under.

16:25.983 --> 16:27.536
I prefer we change
the subject.

16:27.536 --> 16:28.606
Well,

16:28.606 --> 16:29.779
I think it's important
that you know

16:29.779 --> 16:31.057
that he wasn't talking to us.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.196
Of course he wasn't.

16:32.196 --> 16:33.024
He was staunch.

16:33.162 --> 16:34.715
He wouldn't talk to
any fucking jacks.

16:35.889 --> 16:37.822
But his mate
Dickie Needham did.

16:37.822 --> 16:38.892
We couldn't shut him up.

16:38.892 --> 16:41.412
He was ready to spill
his guts on the stand.

16:41.412 --> 16:43.724
Do you think maybe that's
what got him killed?

16:43.724 --> 16:45.105
I think you're
barking up the wrong tree.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.451
I don't give a fuck
about Dickie Needham

16:46.451 --> 16:47.487
and the fact he's dead.

16:47.487 --> 16:48.764
He shouldn't have talked.

16:51.663 --> 16:53.389
Did you know that forensics

16:53.389 --> 16:54.528
matched the bullet

16:54.528 --> 16:55.736
that they dug out of his body

16:55.736 --> 16:57.877
to the gun that Dave
used to kill himself?

16:59.775 --> 17:00.983
Yeah,

17:00.983 --> 17:03.468
it was Dave and Dickie
who robbed the Vietnamese

17:03.468 --> 17:05.091
and shot dead their guy.

17:08.646 --> 17:10.027
Look, I know
this is probably...

17:10.027 --> 17:11.062
That's bullshit.

17:11.752 --> 17:13.237
Why would Dave need to?

17:15.101 --> 17:16.999
What, I don't know.

17:16.999 --> 17:20.071
Everyone needs extra cash
for something, don't they?

17:20.071 --> 17:21.935
Maybe he had
a special project.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.043
Anyway, we think
he killed Dickie

17:26.043 --> 17:27.147
to stop him rolling on you

17:27.147 --> 17:28.700
and then just
tidied up the whole mess

17:28.700 --> 17:30.219
by taking his own life.

17:33.533 --> 17:34.327
Listen John,

17:36.156 --> 17:37.882
there are people
who need to pay

17:38.987 --> 17:40.471
for their role
in all of this.

17:42.818 --> 17:45.269
We all have our cross
to bear, Detective.

17:49.238 --> 17:51.827
Come on.
Come on, you could help me.

17:51.827 --> 17:53.933
I don't have the kind
of access that you do.

17:58.109 --> 18:00.180
Enjoy your drink.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.679
What's doing boys?

18:52.198 --> 18:54.959
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

18:55.649 --> 18:57.893
Doesn't look like nothing
with those matching bumbags.

18:57.893 --> 18:59.688
Not a fucking boy band,
are youse?

19:00.620 --> 19:01.621
It's cool,

19:01.621 --> 19:02.794
we got the green light.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.488
- It's pay to play up here.
- Not anymore, it's not.

19:06.488 --> 19:08.110
Change of management.

19:08.110 --> 19:09.318
Must be out of the loop.

19:10.423 --> 19:12.390
What?

19:12.390 --> 19:14.599
What, well why doesn't
anyone tell me this shit?

19:14.599 --> 19:15.980
Huh?

19:18.500 --> 19:19.673
Son of a...

19:20.778 --> 19:23.539
And then I wouldn't
have to do that.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.648
And that.

19:30.857 --> 19:32.134
Tell your boss,

19:32.686 --> 19:33.825
if I see youse here again,

19:33.825 --> 19:35.517
I won't be so
gentle next time.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.484
Now fuck off.

19:38.382 --> 19:40.384
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bumbags.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.001
Why do we got to
pay for protection for

20:12.001 --> 20:13.831
when you don't even
have the fucking jacks

20:13.831 --> 20:15.143
on the take anymore?

20:16.005 --> 20:18.698
We've been out there
on our own now,

20:18.698 --> 20:20.493
fucking three months.

20:20.493 --> 20:22.322
And now all of a sudden,

20:22.322 --> 20:24.117
you want us to
fucking pay you rent?

20:25.118 --> 20:26.706
Fuck me, Sam.

20:26.706 --> 20:28.915
It's, it's, it's my risk.

20:28.915 --> 20:30.192
I've got enough to
worry about now,

20:30.192 --> 20:31.849
with real fucking cops.

20:32.470 --> 20:34.438
What the fuck are we
actually paying you for?

20:37.751 --> 20:41.030
Hey? Come on guys,
back me up here.

20:46.035 --> 20:46.829
Oh fuck, Sam.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.692
No mate, fuck!

20:47.934 --> 20:49.936
Sam, I didn't mean nothing
by it. Jesus! Fuck!

20:54.354 --> 20:56.494
What the fuck!?

21:02.259 --> 21:05.054
This fucking came
through the fucking window.

21:10.508 --> 21:12.821
Jesus fucking Christ, Sam.

21:23.072 --> 21:24.350
Anyone else?

21:34.843 --> 21:36.465
I'm confused,

21:37.846 --> 21:39.468
I'm letting you
guys work up here.

21:39.468 --> 21:43.196
All I ask is that you pay your
rent every fucking Thursday.

21:43.196 --> 21:44.680
I'm not your friend.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.856
I'm not your partner.
I'm your fucking landlord.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.273
You'll all get two runners each,

21:51.273 --> 21:53.379
if I see more than 10
people on the street,

21:53.379 --> 21:54.932
then I come asking why.

21:54.932 --> 21:56.899
Just stick to your spot.

21:56.899 --> 21:57.762
You need to talk to me?

21:57.866 --> 21:59.661
The boys at the door
know who you are.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.767
Any questions?

22:21.993 --> 22:24.272
So, this thing
at the window.

22:24.272 --> 22:26.343
That happened while
I was in the toilet.

22:28.690 --> 22:29.760
Stuart's been talking a lot

22:29.760 --> 22:31.279
about how he's been
feeling depressed

22:31.279 --> 22:32.659
and shit lately.

22:33.660 --> 22:35.214
You know.

22:36.525 --> 22:38.044
You all heard that, right?

22:45.534 --> 22:46.846
Yeah.

23:16.289 --> 23:17.670
Sorry about Dave.

23:20.914 --> 23:22.261
You knew,

23:22.640 --> 23:23.641
about us?

23:25.333 --> 23:26.161
Yeah.

23:32.374 --> 23:33.617
He loved you, you know.

23:45.767 --> 23:48.666
He would've wanted
you to have that.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.568
Take care, Simone.

24:16.936 --> 24:18.040
Stop him!
Come here, come here.

24:18.040 --> 24:18.869
Hey you.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.228
Fucking get him
out of here. Fuck him off.

24:59.496 --> 25:00.635
Yeah.

25:00.635 --> 25:03.258
You need to curb your dog,

25:03.258 --> 25:05.536
or there'll be consequences.

25:32.287 --> 25:34.669
Everything's changed, Tony.

25:36.705 --> 25:38.431
Nasa's dead.

25:38.431 --> 25:40.468
Joey's in super-max.

25:41.158 --> 25:43.712
Ezra? No one gives
a fuck about anymore.

25:45.265 --> 25:46.094
What?

25:47.233 --> 25:48.061
Without the jacks,

25:48.165 --> 25:49.546
he's just an old guy
who's had his day.

25:49.546 --> 25:50.995
He ought to be
fucking grateful.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.895
If he wants to talk to me,

25:53.895 --> 25:55.068
that's fine.

25:55.068 --> 25:56.035
He can come stand outside

25:56.035 --> 25:57.588
and line up like everyone else.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.800
That's the message you
want me to take back?

26:02.800 --> 26:03.629
Yeah.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.355
It's my fucking street.

26:07.702 --> 26:09.151
If the old man can't get
that through his head,

26:09.151 --> 26:10.877
I don't know what to tell you.

26:10.877 --> 26:12.638
And I'm not kicking up,

26:12.638 --> 26:13.949
so you can tell him
all that's done,

26:13.949 --> 26:15.295
it's finished.

26:16.780 --> 26:18.885
Isn't he in bed
with the Viet's?

26:18.885 --> 26:19.921
Yeah.

26:19.921 --> 26:20.784
So he can have Cabramatta.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.889
What does he want,
the whole fucking city?

26:25.996 --> 26:27.929
I just worry mate,

26:27.929 --> 26:29.862
about the consequences.

26:29.862 --> 26:32.520
I've known him,
a long fucking time.

26:36.075 --> 26:38.802
And I've known you
a long time, Tony.

26:38.802 --> 26:41.460
And I respect you brother,
I do.

26:41.908 --> 26:43.116
But your boss made his choice

26:43.116 --> 26:45.222
when he sided
with the Asians.

26:46.499 --> 26:48.156
What about your brother, Sam?

26:49.502 --> 26:50.710
What about John?

26:51.746 --> 26:53.541
He's all right with
all this, is he?

26:56.820 --> 26:58.028
You know what?

26:58.028 --> 26:59.374
You're right.

26:59.374 --> 27:01.410
It's the wrong message.

27:02.032 --> 27:03.378
Forget about it.

27:04.413 --> 27:06.450
Instead, you tell your boss

27:06.450 --> 27:09.142
that I'll let his
dealers onto the street,

27:09.142 --> 27:12.663
when he comes here in person
and asks permission.

27:12.663 --> 27:13.492
And I don't give a fuck

27:13.492 --> 27:15.321
if he's holding
my brother's hand.

27:16.011 --> 27:17.737
He asks me himself.

27:18.497 --> 27:19.567
Now,

27:19.567 --> 27:21.707
I'm still going to tell
him to go fuck himself,

27:23.398 --> 27:26.090
but I'll let him walk
out of here alive.

27:31.613 --> 27:33.581
All right.

27:42.279 --> 27:44.108
That was the message.

27:46.697 --> 27:48.596
Okay, bye.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.664
What's his
brother suggest?

28:23.700 --> 28:26.841
I mean, I presume you've
spoken to him about this.

28:27.704 --> 28:30.845
Look, he's a club owner.

28:30.845 --> 28:32.329
Give me a break, Jesus Christ.

28:32.329 --> 28:34.952
- John, doesn't deal in drugs.
- Oh, no.

28:34.952 --> 28:37.058
He convinced a
Royal Commission.

28:37.334 --> 28:39.405
So did you,
convince a Royal Commission.

28:39.405 --> 28:41.372
So what, he's an altar boy
all of a sudden...

28:41.372 --> 28:42.581
- What did you just say to me?
- Oh, please.

28:42.581 --> 28:44.617
Girls, girls,
I think we're getting

28:44.617 --> 28:46.239
a little bit
side-tracked here.

28:46.239 --> 28:47.516
Yeah, can we just
keep to the point?

28:47.516 --> 28:48.897
It's a Wednesday,
I've got a schedule

28:48.897 --> 28:50.243
and we've spent half an hour,

28:50.243 --> 28:52.694
discussing the psychological
profile of a drug addict.

28:52.694 --> 28:53.695
I mean, I don't even know

28:53.695 --> 28:55.594
what the fuck I'm doing here.

28:55.594 --> 28:58.251
You know what, Ezra?
I'll go start lunch.

28:58.251 --> 28:59.598
Nice one.

29:00.426 --> 29:01.703
Look, um,

29:03.532 --> 29:05.742
he's a thorn in my side.

29:05.742 --> 29:07.813
All right, which means that
he's a thorn in your side.

29:07.813 --> 29:09.435
So what do you want me to do?

29:09.435 --> 29:11.851
Walk up to Sam Ibrahim
and shoot him in the face?

29:13.646 --> 29:14.543
You can do that?

29:20.204 --> 29:24.933
It's 800 feet of road.

29:26.176 --> 29:29.869
All right, and you've got a
brand new shiny police force.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.250
I mean, you can't control that?

29:31.250 --> 29:32.872
It's not fucking Columbia.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.876
Look, if you need a motion
to put together a task force,

29:36.876 --> 29:38.429
I can use my influence.

29:38.429 --> 29:40.328
The Premier will listen to me.

29:40.328 --> 29:41.260
Anywhere you like girls.

29:41.260 --> 29:42.123
I need your full support.

29:42.123 --> 29:43.642
Anywhere you like.

29:43.745 --> 29:45.195
- Thanks.
- Wonderful.

29:47.266 --> 29:48.543
Enjoy.

29:49.233 --> 29:50.338
This looks great.

29:52.823 --> 29:54.238
What have we got here?

29:54.238 --> 29:55.377
I think I bought this...

30:08.736 --> 30:11.600
Those other ones,
you can send them away...

30:49.708 --> 30:53.539
Frank, what the fuck's
going on here?

30:56.024 --> 30:57.094
We all set?

30:57.094 --> 30:58.855
All set, sir.

30:58.855 --> 30:59.683
Go.

31:11.488 --> 31:13.421
John, pick up.

31:15.872 --> 31:16.700
Yeah.

31:16.838 --> 31:18.219
I've got the Consorting
squad out here.

31:18.219 --> 31:19.461
They said they got a warrant.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.911
Who's in charge?

31:20.911 --> 31:23.396
Detective Donnelly.
He's gone in the back way.

31:24.087 --> 31:26.572
Puck, you do not let them in,
all right.

31:26.572 --> 31:28.332
You just stay there.
Just hold 'em off.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.197
Licensing and
compliance check, sir.

31:31.197 --> 31:32.612
Are you the proprietor?

31:33.165 --> 31:34.373
Who sent you?

31:34.373 --> 31:36.306
Are you John Houssam Ibrahim?

31:36.306 --> 31:37.410
Answer the question.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.793
I'm going to have to get you to
open up that safe for us, sir.

31:40.793 --> 31:43.589
Any weapons on site you
want to declare now?

31:45.004 --> 31:46.626
What the fuck
are you doing?

31:47.041 --> 31:49.284
He's fucking laying them.

31:49.284 --> 31:53.461
- Get out of his face.
- You get out of my face.

31:53.461 --> 31:54.945
Get your fucking
hands off me.

31:58.673 --> 31:59.950
Put your hands up!

31:59.950 --> 32:03.057
What the fuck
are you doing? Fuck!

32:07.233 --> 32:09.477
Go, go. Close the door.

32:17.485 --> 32:19.521
I'm hurt,
you fuckwits.

32:20.729 --> 32:23.284
John, you need
to speak with him.

32:23.284 --> 32:24.803
We're not going
to survive this.

33:02.012 --> 33:03.772
All right, John?

33:06.120 --> 33:09.157
You don't tell Ezra Shipman
to go fuck himself.

33:09.537 --> 33:11.021
I thought you wanted order.

33:11.021 --> 33:14.507
Order? What order?

33:15.025 --> 33:17.165
There are good businesses
shutting down left and right

33:17.165 --> 33:19.098
because of you and your
fucking greasy mates.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.341
Listen to him.

33:20.513 --> 33:22.412
But, no, that is
exactly the point.

33:22.412 --> 33:24.103
You don't fucking listen.

33:24.724 --> 33:27.555
I asked you to leave
it with me, okay?

33:27.555 --> 33:29.729
To work with me.
And instead you do this.

33:31.524 --> 33:33.872
I would've fucking
stabbed him in the eye.

33:33.872 --> 33:35.977
Or push him out
a fucking window?

33:38.497 --> 33:41.120
Is this your
grand plan, Sam?

33:42.535 --> 33:44.675
What, you smash a few
lines with the boys,

33:44.675 --> 33:45.884
you do whatever
the fuck you want,

33:45.884 --> 33:47.989
you get yourself thrown
back in prison again,

33:47.989 --> 33:49.957
and you leave me to clean
up your mess like always.

33:49.957 --> 33:52.028
Do you know how it feels
to have to stick up

33:52.028 --> 33:54.927
for you when you are actively
the one fucking us over?

33:54.927 --> 33:57.965
Knowing that my big
brother is a fucking...

34:03.694 --> 34:06.456
It's fucking embarrassing, Sam.

34:07.767 --> 34:10.011
And you know the
only way this ends is

34:10.011 --> 34:13.083
either you or me or both of
us end up in prison or dead.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.223
And yet you still
fucking do it.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.367
I don't know how
to help you anymore.

34:30.549 --> 34:32.275
Help me?

34:33.448 --> 34:35.278
Help me, John?

34:38.350 --> 34:40.110
Help me do what?

34:41.146 --> 34:43.769
To get out of your way,
to get in line?

34:43.769 --> 34:46.185
Shut up and play the
soldier for ya?

34:46.806 --> 34:49.292
Why am I the problem
all of a sudden, John?

34:50.465 --> 34:52.743
'Cause I'm bad for business?

34:52.743 --> 34:54.883
That's my blood
on that street.

34:54.883 --> 34:56.368
It's my fucking blood too.

34:56.368 --> 34:57.783
Yeah, but you were smart.

34:58.404 --> 35:00.648
You were always
smarter than me.

35:00.648 --> 35:02.788
You made sure you took
a piece for yourself.

35:03.478 --> 35:05.480
I wasn't the problem
back then, was I?

35:05.480 --> 35:07.241
Nah, I was a fucking hero.

35:07.241 --> 35:09.346
The great Sam Ibrahim.

35:09.346 --> 35:11.935
As soon as I start standing
up on my own two feet,

35:11.935 --> 35:14.455
I'll take a piece for
myself here and there.

35:16.250 --> 35:19.011
And I stopped taking
orders from Ezra,

35:19.011 --> 35:20.564
and Nasa fucking Kalouri.

35:20.564 --> 35:23.843
And my little brother,
all of a sudden,

35:23.843 --> 35:25.742
no one wants to know me.

35:26.536 --> 35:27.986
Don't worry.

35:31.644 --> 35:33.888
I know what I am.

35:36.028 --> 35:38.065
I'll save you
the embarrassment.

35:39.066 --> 35:41.033
The last thing I ever
fucking wanted in the world

35:41.033 --> 35:43.794
was for you to help me.

35:50.008 --> 35:51.526
Sam.

35:57.808 --> 36:00.156
Just do what
you got to do, John.

36:01.398 --> 36:03.021
I'll do me.

36:28.425 --> 36:30.255
Maybe just go down
the shop or something.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.980
And do what, exactly?

36:31.980 --> 36:34.466
I don't know, go and
read some magazines,

36:34.466 --> 36:36.606
or bloody buy
some orange juice

36:36.606 --> 36:38.263
or talk to the lady
at the counter.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.299
The lady at the counter? Have
you been down there lately?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.300
No.

36:41.576 --> 36:42.922
'Cause that lady at the counter
is a 15-year-old dropout

36:42.922 --> 36:45.580
who uses instant coffee in
the fucking espresso machine.

36:45.580 --> 36:46.478
Oh c'mon.

36:46.478 --> 36:48.307
No I watched him do it, Declan.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.929
He literally,
the kid served me

36:49.929 --> 36:52.484
an international roast
cappuccino with two teaspoons

36:52.484 --> 36:53.554
out of a fucking can.

36:53.554 --> 36:55.797
Why don't you go and
buy some fishing rods?

36:55.797 --> 36:57.558
Oh fishing rods.
That's a great idea.

36:57.558 --> 36:58.800
Yeah, go down
to the river bend

36:58.800 --> 37:01.009
when the kids get home
from school or something.

37:01.009 --> 37:03.391
Well you know people
actually do come here

37:03.391 --> 37:05.738
by choice, you know, to do
some fishing. Take it in.

37:05.738 --> 37:07.464
Buy a fucking fishing rod?

37:07.464 --> 37:10.088
Ah, for fuck's sake, Princess,
shut the fuck up.

37:10.088 --> 37:13.401
Jesus fucking Christ
I'm going to kill her.

37:13.401 --> 37:15.231
Great, give the kids something
else to cry about when

37:15.231 --> 37:16.715
they get home from school.

37:16.715 --> 37:18.682
- Shoot that fucking dog.
- You fucking little shit.

37:18.682 --> 37:20.132
- Fucking Wyee.
- Motherfucker!

37:20.132 --> 37:24.102
I guarantee you, if you
look it up it means 'shithole'.

37:40.911 --> 37:43.845
Thanks for coming.
I appreciate it.

37:48.402 --> 37:51.715
You know my,
my daughter Sarah?

37:55.754 --> 37:57.963
She won't come
and visit me in here.

38:11.666 --> 38:13.358
I'll see what I can do.

38:16.326 --> 38:17.534
Thank you.

38:18.604 --> 38:19.743
Yeah.

38:35.103 --> 38:36.967
What the?

38:36.967 --> 38:39.487
John, Jesus fucking...

38:42.628 --> 38:43.974
Kill the engine.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.668
Do it.

38:49.325 --> 38:51.119
Got any plans tonight?

38:52.604 --> 38:56.780
My, it's my wife's birthday.
My daughter's coming.

38:56.780 --> 38:58.955
Her husband, grandkids.

38:59.783 --> 39:01.889
- That would be nice.
- Yeah.

39:01.889 --> 39:03.201
Happy birthday.

39:18.837 --> 39:20.908
I'm not the only
one with copies.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.709
What do you, do you?

39:29.537 --> 39:30.987
Is this?

39:32.264 --> 39:33.507
You want money?

39:33.507 --> 39:34.853
Is this a blackmail thing?

39:34.853 --> 39:36.751
You need to be really
careful how you speak

39:36.751 --> 39:38.305
to me right now, Senator.

39:39.409 --> 39:42.309
I've got money.
Plenty of it.

39:42.309 --> 39:44.276
And I earned it.

39:44.276 --> 39:46.002
I'm not like you.

39:46.830 --> 39:52.733
What I want is an address,
but also for your mate,

39:52.733 --> 39:55.114
the Assistant Commissioner
here, to pull his goons

39:55.114 --> 39:57.427
off the strip and
let me run my venues

39:57.427 --> 39:58.877
without unwarranted interference.

39:58.877 --> 40:01.051
That one,
I'm going to hold you to.

40:01.051 --> 40:02.915
I don't know what
kind of influence

40:02.915 --> 40:04.262
you think I might have.

40:04.262 --> 40:07.644
Your daughter, Ashley?

40:09.646 --> 40:12.718
How old would she be now,
what 32, 33?

40:18.690 --> 40:20.243
Life has worked out
pretty well for her

40:20.243 --> 40:23.350
since Spyro became
a distant memory.

40:26.732 --> 40:28.596
Of course you and I
both know that the reason

40:28.596 --> 40:30.357
he's been off the scene
is 'cause his brains

40:30.357 --> 40:32.566
are probably still
ground into his workshop.

40:33.670 --> 40:37.985
And his mate Gibbo, well, I
reckon he was pretty unlucky

40:37.985 --> 40:40.056
to be visiting him that night.

40:42.921 --> 40:46.925
So those, fuck,
you can have those.

40:47.891 --> 40:50.515
Who gives a shit?
That's page three gossip.

40:53.103 --> 40:55.036
Nothing compares
to what you have done.

40:58.730 --> 41:00.559
Double homicide.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.217
It's not the best look
for a senator, is it?

41:59.273 --> 42:00.999
Yeah, just a middy
of New there, China?

42:00.999 --> 42:02.725
Yeah, all right.

42:08.869 --> 42:11.458
- Just passing through mate?
- Yeah.

42:13.114 --> 42:17.395
Yeah, no, strictly
speaking, here and back.

42:18.844 --> 42:21.157
Yeah, flew into Newy from
Melbourne this morning,

42:21.157 --> 42:22.538
drove an hour.

42:22.952 --> 42:24.540
Back to Newy this arvie.

42:25.264 --> 42:27.853
See if I'll be home for tea.
Cheers, digger.

42:48.702 --> 42:51.118
I'm just delivering
a message is all.

42:58.850 --> 43:01.784
I'll tell you what,
Declan, how about you and I

43:01.784 --> 43:03.544
just cut to the chase, eh?

43:03.958 --> 43:05.753
Let's get this
over and done with.

43:07.859 --> 43:09.619
It's just you and me, mate.

43:14.555 --> 43:16.074
We're going somewhere?

43:16.454 --> 43:18.352
Not if I can help it.

43:28.051 --> 43:30.744
So, there's this
bag here, right?

43:33.954 --> 43:36.335
I saw you looking
at it earlier.

43:37.992 --> 43:41.340
There's a hundred grand
in there. True story.

43:42.134 --> 43:43.895
Do a lot with that,
I reckon.

43:48.037 --> 43:50.833
So, here's what's
going to happen.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.387
In about 30 seconds,
I'm going to go over there.

43:53.387 --> 43:55.458
I'm going to take a piss.

43:55.458 --> 43:56.804
And if I come back out here

43:56.804 --> 43:59.289
and you're still
drinking your beer then

43:59.289 --> 44:02.465
I'm going to grab the
bag and go back to Newy,

44:02.465 --> 44:04.640
fly back to Melbourne and
tell the fella that gave it

44:04.640 --> 44:06.849
to me that you don't want it.

44:07.470 --> 44:09.161
And that's your choice.

44:10.922 --> 44:15.409
Or, you take the bag,

44:17.618 --> 44:18.654
you put it in the boot

44:18.757 --> 44:21.208
of that Camry of yours out
there and you drive back

44:21.208 --> 44:23.590
to the missus and the kids
there on Florence Street.

44:23.590 --> 44:25.246
You keep the lot of it.

44:32.599 --> 44:34.186
I'm not lying to you.

44:36.085 --> 44:36.913
Declan.

44:39.709 --> 44:44.921
But, you will have to do
something for me in return.

44:45.922 --> 44:47.165
What is it?

44:49.339 --> 44:50.962
Change your statement.

44:56.381 --> 44:58.935
Tell the coppers you
got your story wrong

44:58.935 --> 45:02.318
on the night Nasa Kalouri
fell off the face of the earth.

45:02.318 --> 45:03.940
You were drunk.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.702
Your former partner, Bryan,
he dropped you at the pub.

45:06.702 --> 45:08.013
You and Kath,
you were going through

45:08.013 --> 45:09.843
a rough, rough, rough spot.

45:11.569 --> 45:14.261
You needed some time by
yourself so you sat there

45:14.261 --> 45:16.470
watching the sport on the
telly, probably drinking

45:16.470 --> 45:18.541
a little more
than you should've.

45:22.200 --> 45:27.654
Then, when the cops finally
got you they verballed you

45:27.654 --> 45:30.311
and they had you tell 'em
everything they needed to hear

45:30.311 --> 45:33.038
so they could pin
something on your partner.

45:38.043 --> 45:40.839
Now, that is a lot
to remember so,

45:42.116 --> 45:43.739
I've written it down.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.122
You just follow the script.

45:53.818 --> 45:55.543
Okay.

46:02.447 --> 46:07.452
And Declan, you know I can't
make your mind up for you,

46:07.452 --> 46:10.317
but since you're in so-called
witness protection, gee,

46:10.317 --> 46:13.492
I'd be thinking how easy was
it for this fellow to come

46:13.492 --> 46:16.461
in here and find me sitting on
my favourite little bar stool.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.917
You understand
what I'm saying?

46:26.540 --> 46:28.300
Have a good day.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.204
Shot.

47:02.852 --> 47:03.681
Yeah.

47:05.993 --> 47:06.822
Tony.

47:12.206 --> 47:13.276
Shit.

47:20.145 --> 47:20.939
Yeah.

47:23.079 --> 47:25.116
Just let me know all the
details when you know.

47:26.704 --> 47:27.946
I'll be there.

47:30.397 --> 47:31.881
I'm really sorry.

47:49.727 --> 47:51.798
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

47:51.798 --> 47:54.110
- All the best, Ezra.
- Thanks a lot.

47:54.110 --> 47:56.319
I'll bring your car around
the front in just a moment.

47:56.319 --> 47:57.631
- Thank you.
- Okay.

48:25.555 --> 48:28.351
Well, I got to admit I wasn't
expecting to see you today.

48:33.667 --> 48:35.980
I came to pay my respects.

48:37.982 --> 48:38.948
For what?

48:40.916 --> 48:42.193
The deceased.

48:44.471 --> 48:45.990
Say her name, John.

48:54.274 --> 48:55.378
To Yael.

49:09.565 --> 49:13.776
You're very honest, John.

49:13.776 --> 49:15.433
I like that about you.

49:18.816 --> 49:20.887
Okay, so we're in conflict.

49:20.887 --> 49:24.476
You and me, which is a
shame, but you're in my home.

49:24.476 --> 49:26.409
So what do you
want to talk about?

49:28.135 --> 49:29.827
Go on pick a subject,
any subject.

49:35.763 --> 49:37.248
Kings Cross.

49:38.456 --> 49:39.837
Really?

49:43.323 --> 49:47.085
I mean, come we, let's
talk about death, shall we?

49:49.605 --> 49:51.503
I mean a fucking heart
attack for fuck's sake.

49:51.503 --> 49:53.195
I mean, how random can it be?

49:54.852 --> 49:57.199
You know she was, she
was looking me in the eye

49:57.199 --> 49:59.649
just right in the eye
the second that she died.

49:59.649 --> 50:01.789
You know, right here.

50:04.378 --> 50:05.863
Last thing she ever saw.

50:10.005 --> 50:13.284
Your brother told me to go
fuck myself. Did you know that?

50:21.430 --> 50:23.294
What do you want from us?

50:23.294 --> 50:27.746
Well, last week I wanted
to get your attention,

50:27.746 --> 50:31.923
which I did obviously.

50:31.923 --> 50:36.721
But now, right now, I think

50:38.447 --> 50:40.898
I want what I had.

50:43.107 --> 50:45.316
I want my wife back.

50:55.153 --> 50:55.982
Yeah.

50:59.571 --> 51:02.885
And I want your lunatic
brother to fuck off back

51:02.885 --> 51:06.061
to Parramatta or wherever
the fuck you guys come from.

51:07.648 --> 51:10.686
You're all so violent.

51:13.137 --> 51:16.934
All such violent men.

51:18.659 --> 51:21.076
I mean, what is that?
Why is that?

51:27.323 --> 51:28.807
Well, what do you want?

51:29.947 --> 51:32.121
You want the
fucking world, right?

51:34.537 --> 51:36.574
The thing is, I don't
give a fuck anymore.

51:37.540 --> 51:39.404
I bled you, John.

51:39.404 --> 51:43.201
And one day your brother will
die violently and he will not

51:43.201 --> 51:45.272
have my fucking sympathy.

51:50.864 --> 51:51.761
I don't think
we should be having

51:51.761 --> 51:53.694
this conversation right now.

51:54.695 --> 51:56.042
Probably not.

51:57.043 --> 51:58.216
No.

52:03.014 --> 52:08.364
But still, maybe I saved you
from the same fate, right?

52:10.401 --> 52:11.643
Yeah.

52:31.870 --> 52:33.872
I have to piss.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.677
Just give me a second,

53:19.677 --> 53:21.437
I'll go move the Bentley
and you're good to go.

53:21.437 --> 53:23.232
Thank you.
