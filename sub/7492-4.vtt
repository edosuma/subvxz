00:07.959 --> 00:09.792
Look at those animals!

00:09.875 --> 00:13.000
This is a classroom.
What do they think they're doing?

00:13.083 --> 00:16.000
If I'm not constantly filling
my brain with knowledge,

00:16.083 --> 00:18.291
that's when the naughty thoughts come.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.959
Well, our new Principal Funderburk
just hired

00:22.041 --> 00:23.750
a sub who's different from the others.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.125
We're finally gonna
get our classroom back.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.166
Playtime's over, Jerry.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.625
It's about to get real up in this hizzy.

00:31.709 --> 00:34.083
-
- <i>♪ Oh, yeah, oh, okay... ♪</i>

00:34.166 --> 00:35.709
- Guys, don't.
- Okay.

00:37.917 --> 00:40.959
The school finally found a substitute
that even you can't break.

00:41.083 --> 00:45.125
He's the perfect storm of discipline,
intelligence, and toughness.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.667
You're forgetting he won
substitute of the year.

00:47.750 --> 00:50.291
I know all about this guy. I am...

00:51.083 --> 00:53.000
The Sub Sinker.

00:54.709 --> 00:55.959
I'm your substitute.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.583
Mr. Testa.

00:58.667 --> 01:02.291
And you should know that I have
not fully conquered my rage issues.

01:04.250 --> 01:07.500
Welcome to our classroom, sir.
This is our teacher's textbook.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.291
Thank you. What's your name, son?

01:09.375 --> 01:11.875
Oh, I'm listed on the honor roll
as "Jerome".

01:11.959 --> 01:14.625
And today we're supposed to do
a recap on chapter six.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.709
Open your books to chapter six.

01:17.792 --> 01:19.291
Take out a clean she...

01:19.792 --> 01:22.041
Oh, sweet love of my life, that's...

01:22.125 --> 01:23.709
my high school sweetheart, Carol Miller.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.166
Until she broke my heart one summer.

01:27.250 --> 01:30.500
Oh, you mean when Jake Martin,
the lifeguard,

01:30.583 --> 01:31.875
took her away on his wave rider,

01:31.959 --> 01:34.750
leaving you sobbing on the beach
in your little ducky inner tube?

01:34.834 --> 01:37.709
- I vowed to one day win her back.
- Well, that day is today.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.208
- Come in, Carol.
- What?

01:40.709 --> 01:42.458
She can't see me like this.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.959
I... I haven't done a sit-up
since the '90s.

01:45.959 --> 01:47.959
I'm hideous!

01:48.041 --> 01:49.917
I've gotta get outta here.

01:56.041 --> 01:57.750
Charge it to Mr. Testa.

01:58.959 --> 01:59.959
Woo!

02:00.041 --> 02:02.959
If only he used his mind for good.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.375

02:46.792 --> 02:50.000
I can't believe Principal Funderburk
canceled geometry class

02:50.083 --> 02:52.542
making us take P.E. in this rec room.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.083
What else can he do?

02:54.166 --> 02:57.125
There's no more subs willing to
teach a class with Jerry in it.

02:57.208 --> 02:59.208
<i>Incoming!</i>
-

02:59.291 --> 03:01.166
What is it?

03:01.917 --> 03:04.125
I think it's some kind of a ball.

03:04.208 --> 03:05.291
What do I do?

03:05.375 --> 03:07.291
- Throw it back!
- I don't know how.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.792
Don't be such a wuss.

03:09.875 --> 03:10.917
I'll do it.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.458
Whoa!

03:15.542 --> 03:17.333
Your arm's like a cannon.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.709
They're coming over.
Just be cool, act casual.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.250
Look...

03:27.875 --> 03:30.083
Because of me, you guys
got stuck in the rec room

03:30.166 --> 03:32.583
and it's not fair
that you have to just sit here.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.417
Pick any sport you want,
and we'll play it.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.709
I don't like it. What if it's a trick?

03:39.375 --> 03:41.083
Don't worry, I got this.

03:42.125 --> 03:45.000
Let's do badminton, the gentleman's game.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.375
Great. We'll serve.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.166
Uh, what are they doing?

04:00.250 --> 04:01.667
I don't know.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.291
Holy Christmas nuts!

04:21.291 --> 04:24.291
We've been shuttlecocked!

04:27.834 --> 04:30.667
Kim, this is gonna be
the greatest ninja marathon ever.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.417
- I mean, three full days!
-

04:33.500 --> 04:37.458
I hear they're gonna break their record
for the most ninja attacks per hour.

04:37.542 --> 04:39.625
We are living in a golden age, Kim.

04:39.709 --> 04:43.083
Behold! "The heart stopper"!

04:43.166 --> 04:45.917
Three feet of bread,
eight different meats,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.083
ten pounds of cheese...

04:49.125 --> 04:50.208
What are you guys gonna eat?

04:51.625 --> 04:55.458
This is literally
the happiest moment of my life.

04:56.583 --> 05:00.000
<i>Rudy! I need your help!</i>

05:00.083 --> 05:01.959
The girlfriend.

05:02.375 --> 05:03.917
Hey, munchkin.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.417
I am not happy.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.291
I am watching my nephew Booker
for the week, and he is a little meanie.

05:10.417 --> 05:12.291
He never shows me any affection

05:12.291 --> 05:14.583
and today,
he got kicked out of nursery school

05:14.667 --> 05:16.291
for poking another child.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.083
I'm gonna say it. I think he's a...

05:19.166 --> 05:20.166
...poker.

05:21.458 --> 05:25.125
That is a sad, sad story.
Thanks for sharing. I'll see ya.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.291
No, wait... Rudy!

05:27.375 --> 05:31.458
You and I are gonna spend every moment
teaching Booker that the poke is no joke.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.834
No, I... uh...

05:34.000 --> 05:35.250
Uh...

05:35.875 --> 05:38.208
I have a better idea.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.250
Why don't you leave Booker with us?

05:42.625 --> 05:44.583
Why should she do that, Rudy?

05:45.583 --> 05:47.583
So I can watch the marathon.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.000
Or I could lock the place up
and no one can watch it.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.041
We'll watch the boy. You deserve a break.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.166
I think, like, at a spa for three days.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.125
Not a moment less.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.500
And Rudy will pay for everything.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.500
Really?

06:00.583 --> 06:02.542
Rudy, are you sure you can handle this?

06:02.625 --> 06:04.959
Are you kidding?

06:05.500 --> 06:08.834
I teach kids discipline and respect
for a living. Come here.

06:08.917 --> 06:10.750
Yes.

06:10.834 --> 06:12.792
Couple of days with uncle Rudy,

06:12.875 --> 06:14.583
and his poking
will be a thing of the past.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.208
The marathon's starting.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.750
I know.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.375
- Thanks, Rudy.
- Yeah, yeah. Kiss, kiss, bye-bye.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.125
All right.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.166
Now you listen to me, little man.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.291
Uncle Rudy's gonna watch
his ninja marathon

06:27.291 --> 06:29.458
and you're gonna sit there...

06:33.375 --> 06:34.917
Listen, Principal Funderburk,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.291
I signed up for geometry
and I'm not going back to P.E.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.417
I still have a shuttlecock on my person

06:40.500 --> 06:43.291
that the nurse says
is going to require a specialist.

06:45.166 --> 06:49.375
I can't bring back geometry
if I can't find a sub to take on Jerry.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.625
Well, it's your job to find that person.

06:51.709 --> 06:53.709
You're responsible for our education.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.208
Oh, that's the problem with students!

06:56.291 --> 06:58.375
It's always about education.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.542
Can't you just be like normal boys
and just try to get some girlfriend...

07:02.625 --> 07:03.875
I'll find someone.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.959
-
- Hey, uh, Rudy, where's Booker?

07:10.041 --> 07:11.083
Who?

07:11.166 --> 07:13.709
- Applebaum's nephew.
- Who?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.959
The kid we're supposed to be watching.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.959
Oh, him? I'm sure he's fine.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.291
My Lovey! My precious, precious Lovey!

07:27.417 --> 07:28.875
I mean, what is that thing?

07:32.458 --> 07:33.625
Okay, ugh.

07:33.709 --> 07:35.917
Rudy, okay, we can't watch the marathon
with Booker crying.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.583
Okay, give him the stupid toy.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.250
Okay. Come on.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.375
But be gentle.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.125
And, and don't squeeze him
that hard, okay?

07:43.208 --> 07:44.959
It's the only thing
that got me through high...

07:45.041 --> 07:46.083
Kindergarten.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.458
<i>Come on. Come here.</i>

07:51.583 --> 07:54.834
Uh, Rudy you think a ninja marathon
is appropriate for Booker?

07:54.917 --> 07:57.667
Please, like he's gonna pay
any attention to the ninja marathon.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.458
Not when he's got Lovey.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.542
-
Shh.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.375
I can't believe Funderburk
found a sub for geometry.

08:27.458 --> 08:28.959
When are these people gonna get it?

08:29.041 --> 08:30.709
I don't come to school to learn.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.500
Don't worry.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.417
I'll sink him just like
I've sunk all the others.

08:43.041 --> 08:44.667
Wait a minute.

08:45.417 --> 08:47.083
You're our new substitute?

08:48.959 --> 08:51.458
They call me Mr. Krupnick!

08:58.125 --> 08:59.750
By dividing the coefficient,

08:59.834 --> 09:04.834
you can see that we have
an acute angle of 73 degrees.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.250
Any questions?

09:06.333 --> 09:07.458
I have a question.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.792
Once you divide the co...

09:09.875 --> 09:12.041
How in the heck are you a teacher, Milton?

09:13.959 --> 09:17.917
The school constitution states
in rule 17-dash-8 that,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.291
"In an emergency situation,
a student with a perfect 5.0 GPA

09:22.417 --> 09:24.792
may become a temporary substitute teacher

09:24.875 --> 09:27.000
until a proper replacement is found."

09:27.083 --> 09:30.041
Yeah! In your delinquent faces!

09:30.125 --> 09:32.917
- Booyah! Say what?
-

09:36.625 --> 09:37.875
Well...

09:38.417 --> 09:40.208
You know what I do to subs, right?

09:40.291 --> 09:42.834
I know every single one of your moves.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.500
Your exploding chalk.

09:49.709 --> 09:51.709
Your electrified filing cabinet.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.667
Oh, really?

10:01.750 --> 10:03.000
Well...

10:04.208 --> 10:06.166
Say hello to my little...

10:09.542 --> 10:10.667
Where'd it go?

10:10.917 --> 10:12.375
Looking for this?

10:13.458 --> 10:15.458
My sonic bowel mover.

10:15.542 --> 10:19.375
That thing vibrates your colon
at 3,000 RPM's.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.792
I'm giving a chapter test tomorrow.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.834
Yeah!

10:29.375 --> 10:31.709
And I think you can pass it, Jerry.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.000
You do?

10:33.542 --> 10:34.834
Absolutely.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.583
I believe in you.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.667
Wow, Milton.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.500
You're the first teacher
that actually believed--

10:44.709 --> 10:46.917
- Uh-oh.
- Do you need to go to the nurse?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.834
No, I need to go to the bathroom!
Now get out of my way!

10:50.667 --> 10:53.291
<i>What are you doing
in the hall during... Oh, no.</i>

10:53.375 --> 10:55.500
<i>Run, boy. Run!</i>

11:41.166 --> 11:42.500
Hyah!

11:48.208 --> 11:50.125
No!

11:50.208 --> 11:51.709
You animal!

11:55.083 --> 11:57.875
I told you it wasn't a good idea for him
to watch the ninja marathon.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.458
Kids that age are like sponges.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.041
What have I done?

12:02.125 --> 12:05.417
I took a little poker
and turned him into a trained ninja.

12:10.667 --> 12:13.041
You're not a ninja. Are you, little man?

12:13.125 --> 12:16.166
No, you're not. No, you're not.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.125
We're in big trouble.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.417
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.542
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

12:32.875 --> 12:36.667
All right, class, this test
will make up 25% of your grade.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.125
I gotta turn the fan on.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.375
I feel my pre-test hot flashes coming on.

12:42.625 --> 12:43.875
Jerry, you worried?

12:43.959 --> 12:44.917
No.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.542
I'm ready.

12:46.625 --> 12:49.083
You'll have 45 minutes
to complete the test.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.375
Begin in three, two...

12:51.458 --> 12:53.083
- one.
-

12:57.041 --> 12:58.834
Yes!

12:58.917 --> 13:00.166
Jerry!

13:00.250 --> 13:01.917
Dude, you've been hit by a giant spitball.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.250
I'm taking you to the principal's office.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.417
Ah! Wait, what? I didn't do anything.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.041
Ow! My ear.

13:18.959 --> 13:22.834
All right, guys, we have to do something
before Ms. Applebaum comes back tomorrow.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.834
I tried to calm him down
with a piece of banana.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.125
The last thing I remember
is getting hit in the nose

13:27.208 --> 13:29.291
with a flurry of fat little baby legs.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.542
Okay, look, we've gotta teach this kid

13:33.625 --> 13:35.500
that there are consequences
to his actions.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.959
Jack, you gotta fight him!

13:37.041 --> 13:38.834
We can't do that. It wouldn't be fair.

13:38.917 --> 13:40.291
It'll be fair if I use this bo staff.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.750
Jack, let's jump him on three.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.667
Stop! Wait, wait, guys, are you serious?

13:45.291 --> 13:46.750
Jack, you're a second-degree black belt,

13:46.834 --> 13:48.917
but this is the toughest opponent
you've ever faced.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.125
Now get out there and beat up that baby!

13:52.875 --> 13:55.166
You're right.
I'm not gonna hurt him, but I'll teach him

13:55.250 --> 13:57.000
what it's like when somebody fights back.

14:00.375 --> 14:01.500
All right, buddy.

14:01.583 --> 14:04.583
You've been a good boy,
but you just can't go around...

14:22.750 --> 14:24.166
Was it at least close?

14:25.250 --> 14:26.959
What do you need to hear, champ?

14:32.834 --> 14:36.208
Milton, I'd like to present you
with this fruit and muffin basket

14:36.208 --> 14:38.291
as a token of our appreciation.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.208
You did something no one else could do.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.375
You got Jerry Martinez expelled.

14:42.458 --> 14:45.667
Yeah!

14:46.500 --> 14:48.625
- Whoo!
- Wait. Jerry was expelled?

14:48.709 --> 14:50.291
- But I shouldn't have been.
- Oh!

14:52.583 --> 14:54.792
Milton, I didn't shoot the spitball. Okay?

14:54.875 --> 14:57.709
I wasn't afraid to take the test
because I took your advice and I studied.

14:57.792 --> 14:58.917
Yeah, right.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.834
You studied for a geometry test?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.166
Look, I didn't do it, but I know who did.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.667
Milton, this is roughly where
you were standing, right?

15:07.750 --> 15:08.625
Mm-hmm.

15:08.959 --> 15:10.166
Allow me.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.041
Uh, I don't think Milton's quite that fat.

15:20.375 --> 15:23.125
As you can see,
this was no ordinary spitball.

15:23.458 --> 15:26.291
This was a super deluxe
saliva-soaked sphere of death

15:26.417 --> 15:29.291
with a circumference of 14.4 centimeters.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.083
You know what circumference is?

15:32.166 --> 15:34.834
It's the linear distance around
the outside of a circular object.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.125
I don't even know who you are anymore!

15:40.917 --> 15:44.208
A spitball this size
wouldn't fit in a straw.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.166
It would take a very
unique delivery system.

15:47.417 --> 15:51.959
Something like, I don't know...
say, Albert's clarinet?

15:56.208 --> 15:59.291
What, so are you accusing me?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.166
I couldn't have shot it at Milton,

16:01.250 --> 16:04.750
because Randy's enormous head
would have been in the way. No offense.

16:04.834 --> 16:05.709
None taken.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.875
My mother says my head's so big
because I have a massive amount of brains.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.291
As I was saying,

16:12.375 --> 16:15.875
this was no ordinary spitball
and it didn't take an ordinary path.

16:16.291 --> 16:20.500
This particular spitball made a 90-degree
turn, a right angle, if you will,

16:20.583 --> 16:22.500
before making impact with its target.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.750
Wait a minute. Hold on.

16:25.834 --> 16:29.542
Okay. So you expect us all to believe
that it turned in mid-air?

16:29.625 --> 16:31.834
That is one magic spitball.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.917
It's not magic. It's math.

16:36.834 --> 16:40.083
You created an external force
when you turned on the fan,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.667
claiming to have a hot flash.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.500
I get hot flashes!

16:44.583 --> 16:47.291
When that lunch lady doubles up
on my tuna and calls me big boy.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.875
Check this out.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.417
That's right! Albert is the spitballer!

17:13.250 --> 17:16.417
It was me. It was me!

17:16.750 --> 17:18.625
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

17:19.125 --> 17:21.542
This has been the worst
three days of my life.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.250
I missed most of the marathon,
I'm gonna lose my girlfriend.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.375
And my Lovey's been torn to shreds.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.000
But at least I can still hear
his comforting words.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.166
<i>I love... you.</i>

17:39.041 --> 17:41.166
- Rudy, he's coming for you!
- Play dead!

17:43.959 --> 17:47.208
The pain I have caused you gives me no joy.

17:51.166 --> 17:56.667
Your sadness makes me realize
my actions have consequences.

17:56.667 --> 18:00.166
I shall never hurt another.

18:07.166 --> 18:10.083
Aw. Look, you did it.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.291
You turned a poker into a hugger.

18:13.291 --> 18:14.917
Can I have kisses?

18:16.125 --> 18:17.959
Oh, my gosh.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.500
That is the first time
he has ever kissed me.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.250
You are a miracle worker.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.125
Wait. Oh, were you crying?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.417
Yes. Because I missed you so much.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.333
Aw!

18:31.417 --> 18:32.458
Now you should go.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.792
Yeah, uh, go spend some quality time
with that little angel.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.542
They grow up so fast.

18:40.291 --> 18:41.750
Marathon!

18:43.834 --> 18:47.625
<i>And that concludes
our ninja marathon.</i>

18:47.709 --> 18:49.291
I can't believe we missed it!

18:49.375 --> 18:51.208
<i>Due to new regulations
concerning programming</i>

18:51.291 --> 18:52.458
<i>that involves fighting,</i>

18:52.542 --> 18:56.166
<i>this will be the last time
we will ever show the ninja marathon.</i>

18:56.250 --> 18:58.291
What? They can't mean forever.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.583
<i>And we totally mean forever!</i>

19:07.458 --> 19:10.125
Albert, it was you? But...

19:10.208 --> 19:12.834
But why? I've never wronged you.

19:12.917 --> 19:14.333
That's the problem.

19:14.417 --> 19:17.667
You've never wronged anyone!
You're always so perfect.

19:17.750 --> 19:21.625
Perfect grades, amazing hair,
and such a ladies' man.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.208
Let's not get crazy.

19:26.625 --> 19:31.041
It hurts me to say this, Jerry,
but your expulsion is cancel...

19:31.125 --> 19:33.041
It's can...

19:34.875 --> 19:35.875
It is can...

19:35.959 --> 19:37.583
Oh, gosh!

19:37.667 --> 19:38.542
You're back in.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.083
Yes!

19:40.291 --> 19:42.834
Albert, go wait in my office.

19:42.917 --> 19:45.542
- I'll be there in a minute.
-

19:45.625 --> 19:47.709
There's a bran muffin
that's got my name on it.

19:52.166 --> 19:54.750
Jerry, one thing doesn't add up.

19:55.792 --> 19:59.250
If you didn't do it, then why did
you yell "yes" after I was hit?

19:59.333 --> 20:01.917
Because I knew the answer
to the first question.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.625
PI times radius squared,
the area of a circle.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.166
Wow.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.250
You told the truth,
and I didn't believe you.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.959
What kind of a teacher am I?

20:18.125 --> 20:19.542
What kind of a friend am I?

20:20.667 --> 20:21.959
A great one.

20:22.709 --> 20:25.125
You believed in me and got me to study.

20:25.208 --> 20:26.750
Nobody's ever done that before.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.041
But I got you kicked out of school.

20:30.959 --> 20:33.083
Being a teacher is too much pressure.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.417
I just wanna be a student again.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.041
Even if it means going back to P.E. class.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:39.583 --> 20:41.667
I cannot go back to wearing shorts!

20:41.750 --> 20:43.709
I've got my mom's legs.

20:44.834 --> 20:45.834
Hold on.

20:46.583 --> 20:50.834
Principal Funderburk, I promise I'm gonna
retire the sub sinker forever.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.500
Well, I guess
I could teach geometry for now.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.959
Let me grab the attendance folder.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.000
- Uh...
-

20:56.083 --> 20:58.291
You know there is nothing
more rewarding than...

20:58.291 --> 21:01.166
-
- Ah! Wow!

21:03.291 --> 21:05.375
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

21:08.417 --> 21:10.625
-
- I love these old comedies.

21:10.709 --> 21:13.709
I know, right? There's nothing
like a good old-fashioned pie fight.

21:14.166 --> 21:15.792
So you gave Booker back
to your sister, huh?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.792
- Oh, no. He's here.
- What?

21:17.875 --> 21:20.166
What do you mean, "he's here"?
What if he saw this?

21:20.250 --> 21:22.417
So he saw a pie fight.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.917
What harm could come from that?

21:56.709 --> 21:57.625
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.750 --> 22:02.667
<i>Yes!</i>
