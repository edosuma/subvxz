00:11.440 --> 00:13.590
Zoe:
Prey/ous/y on
scream...
What do you want?

00:13.610 --> 00:16.602
Distorted voice:
I want to see what happens
when she finds out the truth.

00:16.610 --> 00:20.979
Please don't.
You ’re not a vict/m, Audrey.
You ’re a k/Y/er.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.301
I would do anything
to keep it secret

00:23.320 --> 00:25.709
I brought Piper
to lakewooo’.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.608
What I don't get is how
the killer even knew

00:27.620 --> 00:29.315
about the recording
in the first place.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.810
Unless this is about us.
Oh, no.

00:30.820 --> 00:34.278
Zoe, I might have
gotten you involved.
I need you back on this case.

00:34.290 --> 00:37.999
This is that picture of Emma
at the pig farm. You know
where I'm going with this.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.969
The sheriff told me
that Eli has a restraining
order against him.

00:40.970 --> 00:44.929
Apparently, he broke
into some girls
bedroom in Atlanta.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.259
That's completely insane.

00:46.270 --> 00:47.862
Can I get a chance
to explain, please?

00:47.870 --> 00:50.976
Emma, wait!
Audrey:
Now, a// this stuﬁ‘ about Eli?

00:50.980 --> 00:54.472
Do you think
he could he doing this?
Could he be d0/ng all of this?

00:54.480 --> 00:57.472
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, it's Piper!

00:57.480 --> 01:01.985
The killer wanted us
to find Piper's body together
because we both killed Piper,

01:01.990 --> 01:05.881
and now, he wants
revenge on both of us.

01:08.290 --> 01:11.851
Maggie:
Piper Shaw. White female.
In her mid-twenties.

01:11.860 --> 01:15.364
Five foot nine.
Approximately, 140 pounds.

01:15.370 --> 01:17.497
Initial cause of death,
gunshot to the head,

01:17.500 --> 01:19.297
_ as stated
In preVIous autopsy.

01:19.310 --> 01:23.838
There's decay present,
but inconsistent
with time of death.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.775
Subject was removed
from her grave

01:26.780 --> 01:29.977
and preserved
through refrigeration.

01:40.260 --> 01:45.653
There's a, um...
A fresh incision
along the sternum.

01:45.670 --> 01:49.788
These are...
These are new stitches.

01:51.940 --> 01:56.365
You don't have to do this.
She's your daughter.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.371
Yes, I do.

02:07.320 --> 02:07.979
Oh...

02:07.990 --> 02:10.618
That's strange.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.055
It's a heart.

02:19.070 --> 02:21.061
It's a pig's heart.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.611
_ I haven't_ been _
In your room In a thIe.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.078
It's changed.
Yeah.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.756
After last night,
i need answers about Piper.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.796
This is about us
and it's about her,

02:53.800 --> 02:57.736
and you can't keep things
from me anymore.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.594
I get it.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.968
Okay, uh...

03:04.980 --> 03:10.577
Think of this
as your own personal
Audrey Jensen ama.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.872
Do your worst.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.747
Okay. So...

03:18.490 --> 03:20.549
You knew that Piper
was my half-sister

03:20.560 --> 03:23.927
the whole time
that she was here
in lakewood?

03:23.930 --> 03:25.591
Yeah.

03:25.930 --> 03:29.491
And last year,
when... I started to think

03:29.500 --> 03:32.958
that the killer was probably
my half-sibling...

03:34.640 --> 03:35.959
Why didn't you say anything?

03:35.980 --> 03:39.507
I never, in a million years,
thought she could be the killer.

03:39.510 --> 03:40.977
And she swore to me
she wasn't.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.744
And knowing what you knew,
that was good enough for you?

03:43.750 --> 03:46.116
No, no. She and I...

03:54.930 --> 03:58.821
The night Rachel died,
i was with Piper.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.761
We were up late
at the Crescent palms motel,

04:01.770 --> 04:04.534
going over
Brandon James stuff.

04:04.540 --> 04:07.566
If she didn't kill Rachel,
how could she be the killer?

04:07.570 --> 04:13.133
And... and I thought
she was my friend.

04:13.150 --> 04:15.072
Okay.

04:16.450 --> 04:20.113
Okay. So...
You were with Piper.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.917
Yes.

04:22.990 --> 04:26.187
How do I know
that you're not
lying right now?

04:26.190 --> 04:27.714
I would n_ever_
use Rachel In a he.

04:27.730 --> 04:30.119
I don't know that
after everything
that you've done.

04:30.130 --> 04:31.529
You know
me.
No.

04:31.530 --> 04:34.465
I knew you.
We were best friends.

04:34.470 --> 04:36.199
And then, we drifted apart.
That's one way to say it.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.692
And then,
you brought Piper here
to get back at me.

04:39.710 --> 04:43.100
No!
Even if you didn't know
that she was a psycho,

04:43.110 --> 04:45.499
you were still trying
to do that to hurt me.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.137
No! No, I wasn't!
Yes, you were!

04:47.150 --> 04:49.846
Why else would you
bring her here?

04:49.850 --> 04:53.069
I wanted to make
a documentary
about Brandon James.

04:53.090 --> 04:54.648
This was not
about you, Emma.

04:54.650 --> 04:57.619
It was about lakewood
and-and hypocrIsy.

04:57.620 --> 05:00.487
And I was just
collateral damage?

05:01.760 --> 05:05.127
Oh, my god.
Audrey, this is your
last chance, okay?

05:05.130 --> 05:09.760
Tell me the truth.
Stop lying, stop covering.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.635
We need to be
on the same side
rIght now,

05:11.640 --> 05:15.462
and I am definitely
not on your side.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.574
I don't know
what else to say.

05:24.620 --> 05:27.043
(Inhales deeply)
Okay.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.245
This was a horrible idea.

05:34.130 --> 05:35.859
(Door closes)

05:42.700 --> 05:46.796
Did we get anything
from Hayley meyers' phone?
Or anything about a boyfriend?

05:46.810 --> 05:48.960
Nothing yet, sir.
What about my son?

05:48.970 --> 05:53.077
Word is, stavo was
at the party last night,
but nothing after that.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.208
All right, let everyone know,
if they see him, bring him in.

05:56.220 --> 06:00.247
You got it, sir.
Maggie, can I have a word?

06:01.220 --> 06:03.916
Sure. Thanks.

06:05.220 --> 06:07.927
(Clears throat)
(Sighs)

06:07.930 --> 06:09.659
There are a lot
of possibilities here,

06:09.660 --> 06:13.096
but you have to see
what I'm seeing.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.624
No, I don't.

06:14.630 --> 06:16.666
Who else would dig up
the past like that?

06:16.670 --> 06:18.991
I'm not just talking
about Piper's body.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.037
A pig heart?
That's for us.

06:22.040 --> 06:25.578
About what we did.
Who else would know
about that?

06:25.580 --> 06:28.947
Piper apparently
found out a lot.
Maybe she told someone.

06:28.950 --> 06:31.168
Or maybe the simplest answer
is the right one.

06:31.180 --> 06:33.114
I know this is hard
for you to hear,

06:33.120 --> 06:35.088
but Piper was
his daughter, too.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.183
Maybe her death brought him
out of the woodwork.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.282
Maybe he wants revenge.

06:38.290 --> 06:41.987
Brandon couldn't have
survived all that...

06:41.990 --> 06:43.127
Out there on his own.

06:43.130 --> 06:46.998
Even if he did, he wouldn't
do something like this.
He wouldn't target Emma.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.628
You always saw him differently
than the rest of the world did.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.269
(Sighs)
That's because
i knew him better.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.636
I have to get back to work.

06:56.310 --> 06:58.005
(Sighs)

06:58.640 --> 07:00.608
(Door closes)

07:02.780 --> 07:05.874
(Faint music playing
in headphones)

07:07.220 --> 07:09.142
(Knocking on window)

07:09.890 --> 07:11.812
(Turns off music)

07:13.930 --> 07:19.357
(Suspenseful music playing)

07:19.370 --> 07:21.224
Maggie?

07:21.230 --> 07:23.721
What's going on?

07:37.280 --> 07:41.944
Zoe:
I can ’t come
to the phone r/ght now,
but leave a message.

07:41.950 --> 07:44.214
Hey, Zoe! Zo-ologist!

07:44.220 --> 07:47.212
Sorry, not funny.
Just trying it out. Um...

07:47.230 --> 07:50.950
Hey, so you weren't
in psych today. What's up?

07:50.960 --> 07:56.694
You're always in class,
so, uh, just thought
I'd say hey.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.236
Hey!
(Chuckles)

07:58.240 --> 08:00.196
Um... anyway,
not stalker-y,

08:00.210 --> 08:02.633
but just, you know,
given the recent events,

08:02.640 --> 08:06.076
maybe you could call,
text, uh, bat signal,

08:06.080 --> 08:08.241
so I know you're okay?

08:08.250 --> 08:11.048
Okay. Um...

08:11.920 --> 08:14.070
(Phone dings)

08:25.860 --> 08:27.851
(Phone dings)

08:53.330 --> 08:55.218
(Phone dings)

09:07.840 --> 09:09.432
(Phone dings)

09:16.320 --> 09:19.346
(Phone dings)
(Chuckles)

09:33.970 --> 09:36.063
(Phone dings)

09:52.350 --> 09:54.147
(Phone dings)

09:54.490 --> 10:00.952
Uh, Zoe! Maybe this
isn't the best time
for a scavenger hunt!

10:01.790 --> 10:03.155
(Phone ringing)
(Screams)

10:03.160 --> 10:06.095
(Chuckles, sighs)

10:08.030 --> 10:11.488
Zoe.
Distorted voice:
Hello, lVoah.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.937
Who, uh...
Who is this?

10:13.940 --> 10:17.432
Long time listener,
ﬁrst t/me cal/er.
(Chuckles)

10:17.440 --> 10:18.873
Why do you have
Zoe's phone?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.939
Where. is she? _
We ’re ha V/ng a p/cn/c,

10:20.950 --> 10:24.442
and she wanted to see you
one last t/me.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.247
If you hurt her,
i swear i...

10:26.250 --> 10:27.774
Don ’t you know the rules?

10:27.790 --> 10:29.485
Now that you and Zoe
have had sex,

10:29.490 --> 10:33.017
you ’re both
on the slasher
chopping block.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.383
Isn ’t it how that goes?

10:34.390 --> 10:36.255
You need to update
your genre references.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.887
That's a pretty outdated
way of thinking.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.994
Come mm the woods, Noah,
or I ’m gonna make sure

10:41.000 --> 10:45.334
your little girlfriend
needs a closed casket

10:50.440 --> 10:53.307
There_are a lot
of faIry tales
and horror movies

10:53.310 --> 10:54.538
about going
into the woods.

10:54.550 --> 10:59.112
And they usually end up
with wolves, or bears, or...

10:59.120 --> 11:01.179
An axe-wielding maniac.

11:01.190 --> 11:04.956
I mean,
i am really going out
on a limb here, so...

11:04.960 --> 11:07.849
You know, why don't you
give me something?

11:07.860 --> 11:12.058
Tell me why you're doing
all this murder stuff.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.824
Hello?
(Rustling)

11:14.830 --> 11:17.993
(Breathing heavily)

11:18.000 --> 11:21.606
(Breathlessly)
Oh, god... oh, god...

11:25.880 --> 11:27.472
(Groaning)

11:42.460 --> 11:46.248
It's not supposed
to end like this.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.194
Emma!

11:53.210 --> 11:54.962
No, Emma, wait!

11:55.210 --> 11:58.805
Noah wasn't in class today,
and-and he hasn't been
answerIng any of my calls.

11:58.810 --> 12:01.005
I'm really starting
to freak out.
I haven't seen him.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.046
Have you talked
to him at all?
No, that's the thing.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.939
I know that he was annoyed
with me yesterday about
the Zoe thing, but...

12:05.950 --> 12:09.113
(phone vibrating)
(Phone dings)

12:14.460 --> 12:16.485
Oh, my god!
He's got Noah.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.890
Wait. Can you tell
where he is?

12:19.900 --> 12:22.164
(Ringtone playing)

12:22.570 --> 12:25.892
D/ston‘ed voice:
How are .
my fa vor/te final g/r/s?

12:25.900 --> 12:29.802
If you hurt Noah,
i will come for you.
Any more threats,

12:29.810 --> 12:31.698
and I light
his cofﬁn on fire

12:31.710 --> 12:33.507
and let you watch h/m burn.

12:33.510 --> 12:34.238
Where is he?

12:34.250 --> 12:36.571
You ’re gonna go on
a little treasure hunt.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.140
If you tell anyone...
Cops, friends,

12:39.150 --> 12:40.947
strangers
in a school hallway...

12:40.950 --> 12:42.815
Noah dies.
This is about us.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.788
It isn't about Noah.
Why are you doing this?

12:44.790 --> 12:48.783
Because it’s more fun
th/s way, don’t you th/nk?

12:48.790 --> 12:50.052
If you follow my clues,

12:50.060 --> 12:51.994
maybe you can save
Noah is life.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.118
He has... oh, about
ﬁve hours of air leﬁ‘.

12:56.130 --> 12:57.563
Clocsz tick/ng.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.265
Come on, come on.

13:00.740 --> 13:06.133
(Coughing, wheezing)

13:07.910 --> 13:10.504
(Groaning)

13:11.250 --> 13:13.138
(Groans)

13:18.060 --> 13:20.153
(Breathing heavily)

13:25.300 --> 13:27.256
I was stabbed.

13:27.670 --> 13:30.662
And someone is recording me.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.065
This is not good.

13:36.680 --> 13:40.070
Help! Help!

13:40.080 --> 13:42.048
(Coughing)

13:47.990 --> 13:50.641
I ’m buried alive.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.758
In a cofﬁn.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.819
A literal cofﬁn.

13:57.030 --> 14:00.693
But maybe somebody
can see this?

14:00.700 --> 14:02.691
Hey, guys. Uh...

14:02.700 --> 14:05.134
I ’m alive. St/l/ alive.

14:05.140 --> 14:06.289
10/8356 60/776 581/6 me.

14:06.300 --> 14:10.703
I was just at wren lake,
so... maybe I ’m there?

14:10.710 --> 14:14.237
And Zoe. Maybe
she is somewhere close.

14:14.680 --> 14:21.119
I ’m just gonna stay calm
and conserve my oxygen.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.311
Unless I'm talking
to the killer.

14:28.130 --> 14:30.724
And no one's coming.

14:31.130 --> 14:32.154
Is that it?

14:32.160 --> 14:34.355
Are you just
recording my final hours

14:34.370 --> 14:36.725
to torment my friends?

14:37.840 --> 14:40.798
In which case,
this is how I die.

14:40.810 --> 14:41.868
Slow suffocation.

14:41.870 --> 14:46.876
Number three on my "top ten
worst ways to go" list.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.336
I'm not gonna freak out.

14:48.350 --> 14:52.218
I ’m not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.943
Female voice:
Help!

14:55.290 --> 14:58.145
Help! Please!

14:58.160 --> 15:00.355
Hello? Is somebody else
out there?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.851
Please!
Hello?

15:03.300 --> 15:05.291
Hello!

15:07.270 --> 15:09.124
What are the clues?
What is he talking about?

15:09.130 --> 15:11.018
We have to call sheriff acosta.
He could keep It qUIet.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.235
No, okay? No, absolutely not!
We do that and Noah's dead.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.061
How is this psycho
gonna know if we call him?
Maybe he hacked our phones.

15:16.070 --> 15:18.777
I don't know.
He seemed to know we were
together when he called.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.668
Audrey, we cannot do this.
No, absolutely not, okay?

15:20.680 --> 15:23.979
We can't risk it!
You don't get it!
This is how he works.

15:23.980 --> 15:26.175
I tried to cheat him before
and he made me pay.

15:26.180 --> 15:28.717
He killed a hotel clerk
just to prove a pomt!

15:28.720 --> 15:31.416
He will one hundred percent
kill Noah if we cross him.

15:31.420 --> 15:34.856
The only chance we have
is to play his game.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.078
Okay. Where do we start?

15:37.100 --> 15:39.159
(Phone vibrates)

15:41.700 --> 15:43.224
Where he went wrong?
How do we figure that out?

15:43.240 --> 15:46.869
"He thought he had all
the answers." Okay, maybe
he was getting too close?

15:46.870 --> 15:50.033
How are we supposed to know
what he's thinking?

15:50.440 --> 15:52.738
We know where
hIs answers are.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.342
His murderboard.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.293
(Breathing heavily)

16:26.710 --> 16:28.439
Brandon, we're there.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.945
(Grunts)

16:41.060 --> 16:42.857
He left this.

16:52.100 --> 16:56.264
Now, we have to forget
all about this.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.079
(Sighs)

17:43.090 --> 17:44.284
(Banging)

17:44.290 --> 17:46.850
(Ceiling creaking)

17:46.860 --> 17:50.523
(Footsteps)

18:22.290 --> 18:24.053
(Banging)

18:44.520 --> 18:46.909
Sheriff's department!

19:33.670 --> 19:37.322
Hey, check it out.
We're in the right place.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.990
Wait, what is
Noah's obsession?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.139
The murders?
Brandon James? The morgue?

19:42.140 --> 19:44.267
I don't_ know. Noah is
an obsesswe nerd by nature.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.202
Maybe it's this. Maybe
it's on the murderboard.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.235
We're supposed to find
where he went wrong.
How do we do that?

19:48.250 --> 19:49.649
There's too much here!
It's impossible!

19:49.650 --> 19:51.902
Maybe his obsession
blinded him to the truth,

19:51.920 --> 19:53.649
and that is where
he went wrong.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.379
I'm so sick
of these cryptic clues.

19:55.390 --> 19:58.314
Maybe it's in his podcast?

20:03.600 --> 20:06.194
Audrey's voice:
Dear P/per. . .

20:19.940 --> 20:21.703
Best Audrey.

20:22.110 --> 20:24.169
Damn it!
I'm not seeing anything!

20:24.180 --> 20:26.717
What'd you find?
Nothing.

20:27.590 --> 20:31.082
What's behind
Noah's obsession?

20:31.090 --> 20:33.388
I don't know! Insomnia
and too much caffeine?

20:33.390 --> 20:35.449
Are we really gonna
find Noah this way?

20:35.460 --> 20:38.679
I mean, we are clearly
missing something!

20:39.430 --> 20:43.992
Maybe it's a riddle.
What is Noah's obsession?

20:44.000 --> 20:46.662
The murderboard.
The board.

20:46.670 --> 20:48.467
What's behind...

20:52.110 --> 20:56.444
Oh, my god. It's literal.
What is behind the board?

21:00.250 --> 21:02.070
Wow. This really
is about us.

21:02.090 --> 21:06.550
What do you mean?
It's a daffodil.
Yeah. don't you remember?

21:06.560 --> 21:09.984
I think I know
where to go.

21:14.130 --> 21:16.928
Okay, I ’m not really
hear/ng a voice.

21:16.940 --> 21:21.434
There isno voice. _
I am just /mag/n/ng /t.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.432
(Noah humming)

21:24.440 --> 21:26.408
(Breathing heavily)

21:26.410 --> 21:30.449
See, Noah? No voice.
No voice.

21:30.450 --> 21:33.010
(Screaming)

21:33.020 --> 21:34.339
You're starting
to hyperventilate.

21:34.350 --> 21:36.011
I'm starting
to hallucinate.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.318
You think I'm a figment
of your imagination?

21:38.320 --> 21:41.016
I know you are.
This is impossible.

21:41.030 --> 21:44.522
I'm buried alive
and startIng to lose it.

21:44.930 --> 21:49.128
Did you know that taphephobia,
the fear of being buried alive,

21:49.130 --> 21:51.166
is one of the most
well documented

21:51.170 --> 21:53.161
and primal
pathological fears?

21:53.170 --> 21:54.398
Yes, of course I do,

21:54.410 --> 21:58.460
because you're just
in my head, saying
what I already know.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.475
Are you sure?

22:03.450 --> 22:05.406
You seem so real.

22:08.690 --> 22:10.715
I'm scared, Zoe.

22:11.420 --> 22:14.150
It's okay to be afraid.

22:31.540 --> 22:35.749
The only ones
that aren't afraid
are the monsters.

22:39.350 --> 22:41.375
(Phone dings)

22:41.590 --> 22:45.048
don't answer.
I know. I've already ignored
three of Kieran's calls.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.985
Good. Radio silence.
It's safer this way.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.581
Are you sure
the old stables is where
we're supposed to go?

22:51.600 --> 22:54.558
Yeah. Those daffodils grew
all around the old barn.

22:54.570 --> 22:57.494
They made a big point
of telling us they were
poisonous to the horses.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.639
No, I remember that,
but how would the killer
know that?

22:59.640 --> 23:02.734
How would he know
that a daffodil
would send us there?

23:02.740 --> 23:05.106
Flowers grow
a lot of places.
You said it yourself.

23:05.110 --> 23:09.171
This is about us.
And that's where we first met.
I'm sure that this is it.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.546
But what is he trying to do?
Why is he sending us there?

23:11.550 --> 23:13.609
Whoever's doing this
is screwing with us.

23:13.620 --> 23:16.544
Sending us to a place
we used to love,
trying to ruin it...

23:16.550 --> 23:20.316
It's important to them
because it's important to us.

23:21.030 --> 23:24.727
When my mom got sick,
it was the only place
where I felt okay,

23:24.730 --> 23:28.154
the only place
i could forget
what was going on.

23:28.170 --> 23:34.029
Yeah. We used to go
to the stables even
after they shut them down.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.337
Play outside.

23:35.340 --> 23:39.731
Pretend_ to be elves
traveIIng across
middle earth.

23:39.740 --> 23:42.447
We were so close back then.

23:42.450 --> 23:44.270
Basically family.

23:44.280 --> 23:48.068
Then, a couple years later,
you tried to destroy us.

23:49.490 --> 23:53.381
What did I do to make you
hate me so much?

23:54.490 --> 23:57.653
Like I said,
it wasn't about you guys.

24:05.240 --> 24:10.064
I already read it.
It really cleared up
some things.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.537
Emma, this isn't...
Just don't.

24:20.790 --> 24:25.113
What is it?
What's wrong?
(Door closes)

24:25.460 --> 24:27.155
I went back
to the pig farm.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.787
There's a hidden room.

24:28.790 --> 24:31.486
I found furniture,
photos of Emma.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.628
I think Brandon James
might be back.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.621
He could be alive.
We don't know.

24:36.630 --> 24:38.769
I just don't think
it's possible.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.328
He's dead
in the woods somewhere.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.501
Well, somebody's living
in that pig farm.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.704
If it's not Brandon James,

24:43.710 --> 24:46.235
then it's somebody
who knows our secrets.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.207
Either way,

24:47.210 --> 24:50.441
what's happening now
is on us.

24:51.650 --> 24:55.643
All right.
Let's say he is back.
What can we do?

24:55.650 --> 24:59.689
It's not like I can put
an apb out on a ghost.

24:59.690 --> 25:03.558
I think I may have a way
to tell if he's really back.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.654
How?
It's a long shot.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.629
Be careful.

25:17.410 --> 25:19.503
Okay, your turn. Ready?

25:19.510 --> 25:21.137
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.

25:21.150 --> 25:26.474
You're _in a rocket.
It's at Its apogee.

25:27.250 --> 25:30.617
You're in that moment
where everythIng

25:30.620 --> 25:33.316
is perfectly still...

25:33.520 --> 25:36.853
Right before
you're about to fall.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.921
Do you feel it?

25:39.930 --> 25:43.229
I feel... dizzy.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.861
Weightless.

25:45.870 --> 25:48.464
There's a window...

25:48.810 --> 25:52.166
And you can see
the earth below.

25:52.180 --> 25:56.241
It's a blue,
swirling marble.

25:56.810 --> 25:59.608
It's so beautiful.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.508
Wow.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.909
And I'm there with you.

26:04.820 --> 26:06.515
Forever.

26:21.310 --> 26:22.800
Zoe?

26:22.810 --> 26:26.871
No, no. I'm not...
Imagining you.

26:27.650 --> 26:32.678
No, no, no...

26:32.680 --> 26:34.739
No, no! God, no!

26:34.750 --> 26:36.638
No! No, no!

26:36.650 --> 26:41.485
(Crying, screaming)

26:57.640 --> 27:01.178
It still doesn't add up.
How does the killer know
about our childhood?

27:01.180 --> 27:02.670
How would he know
about some random flowers?

27:02.680 --> 27:06.241
They're not random.
You just have to trust me.
We're in the right spot.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.571
How can i...?
Noah's life is in danger,

27:08.590 --> 27:10.342
and you're still
keeping me in the dark.

27:10.350 --> 27:12.409
They must have been
working with Piper
from the very beginning.

27:12.420 --> 27:15.548
It's the only thing
that makes sense.
What?

27:15.560 --> 27:18.222
Piper and I came here
a couple times.

27:18.230 --> 27:20.255
I brought her here.
I told her everything
about us.

27:20.260 --> 27:24.959
Why?
She wanted to know about you.
She was your sister.

27:24.970 --> 27:27.632
(Scoffs)
I know what this
sounds like, Emma,

27:27.640 --> 27:30.200
but I think I was just
looking for a friend.

27:30.210 --> 27:32.269
I didn't know
she was usmg me.
I didn't realize.

27:32.280 --> 27:38.003
I never realized it
until the last moment
and, by then, it was too late.

27:41.020 --> 27:44.183
We have to go.
This psycho is
doing this on purpose.

27:44.190 --> 27:46.055
He showed you that letter
to tear us apart!

27:46.060 --> 27:49.279
Yeah. You're still
the one who wrote it.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.452
Gah!

27:53.230 --> 27:54.652
(Sighs)

27:59.400 --> 28:02.392
(Phone ringing)

28:04.110 --> 28:06.237
Acosta here.
Distorted voice:
I need to report

28:06.240 --> 28:09.243
some very suspicious
acdvim shen'ﬁf

28:09.250 --> 28:11.741
Who's this?
I ’o’ l/ke
to rema/n anonymous.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.570
I ’0’ hate for this
to get back to me.

28:13.580 --> 28:16.048
But something very strange
has been going on here

28:16.050 --> 28:18.018
at the old horse stab/es
on route 6.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.419
You know the place?
I do.

28:19.420 --> 28:21.684
What do you mean
by "strange"?
Itis abandoned

28:21.690 --> 28:24.557
but someones been going
out there, to the barn.

28:24.560 --> 28:27.222
I ’ve heard screams,
squeals...

28:27.230 --> 28:29.721
It sounds l/ke
somebodyis be/ng gutted

28:29.730 --> 28:32.597
When did you hear all this?
You’d better get
out there now.

28:32.600 --> 28:36.559
Maybe you can make it stop.
(Hangs up)
How did you...?

28:53.160 --> 28:55.048
That's not ominous.

28:55.330 --> 28:58.288
Okay, let's do this.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.237
You ready?

29:13.440 --> 29:15.806
(Flies buzzing)

29:15.810 --> 29:16.708
Oh...

29:16.710 --> 29:21.249
(Coughing)
What is that?

29:21.520 --> 29:25.786
Oh, my god. It's a pig.
I've had nightmares
about that.

29:25.790 --> 29:28.611
That's-that's not possible.

29:29.230 --> 29:32.119
We have to find Noah.
Okay, um... where, where?

29:32.130 --> 29:36.726
Look for...
look for signs of digging.
Look for fresh dirt.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.819
(Phone dings)

29:38.840 --> 29:40.865
Audrey, come here.

29:45.810 --> 29:49.268
Oh, my god!
(Gasps)
Oh, god...

29:49.750 --> 29:51.547
(Phone dings)

29:54.420 --> 29:56.741
This is where he killed Jake.
This is where Jake died.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.856
Is Noah really here,
_ or is this sicko
just tormentIng us?

29:59.860 --> 30:01.418
(Grunts)
Noah's running out of time.

30:01.430 --> 30:04.854
Okay, okay. He's gotta
be here somewhere, okay?

30:05.560 --> 30:07.425
No, no, no, no, no!
What? What?

30:07.430 --> 30:09.489
The video cut out!
Why did the VIdeo cut out?

30:09.500 --> 30:12.162
You... you go outside and look
in that field of daffodils,

30:12.170 --> 30:14.764
and I'm gonna
finish looking in here.

30:15.910 --> 30:19.209
You've got
to stay awake, Noah.

30:19.580 --> 30:22.629
Maybe I should just sleep.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.277
It's easier if I sleep.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.477
No, that wouldn't be good.

30:29.820 --> 30:33.153
I was thinking,
in the spring...

30:33.360 --> 30:39.287
We could go to prom,
and you can wear
that adorable tux.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.593
And when we graduate...

30:41.600 --> 30:43.727
What do you think?

30:43.730 --> 30:47.496
We could go to school
in the same city.

30:47.510 --> 30:51.662
Boston would be cool.
Boston...

30:51.880 --> 30:57.409
Mit? What do you say?

30:57.820 --> 30:59.708
I'd like that.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.211
Rocket scientists.

31:03.550 --> 31:04.915
Maybe we could
stay together...

31:04.920 --> 31:07.252
Zoe:
hush, little baby...

31:07.260 --> 31:10.479
grow old together...
Grow young together...

31:10.490 --> 31:16.395
gonna buy you
a mock/ngbird
maybe we could go back...

31:16.400 --> 31:17.492
When I was just a...

31:17.500 --> 31:24.668
And if that mockingbird
don ’t sing

31:29.980 --> 31:33.711
hush, little baby

31:35.350 --> 31:37.739
hey! Did you find anything?
No, there's nothing out there.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.978
He's gotta be inside.
I already looked in here.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.548
There's nothing in here.
Look again!

31:41.560 --> 31:45.451
Do not put this on me!
What is that
supposed to mean?

31:45.460 --> 31:47.257
Nothing.
Nothing?

31:47.260 --> 31:48.898
No, no, no.
I didn't do this!

31:48.900 --> 31:51.460
You brought this
down on all of us!

31:51.470 --> 31:52.869
You brought Piper here!

31:52.870 --> 31:54.462
And why?
What did I do to you?

31:54.470 --> 31:55.789
I was pissed, okay?
I was pissed!

31:55.810 --> 31:57.539
You had your new friends
and you abandoned me.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.428
You wanted nothing
to do with them!
Whatever!

31:59.440 --> 32:02.307
No, not whatever!
Why did you hate me?
What did I do to you?

32:02.310 --> 32:04.904
You really want
to know right now?
Yes, I really want to know.

32:04.920 --> 32:08.572
Why did you hate me?
You broke my heart!

32:13.420 --> 32:17.322
I loved you, okay?
And you broke my heart.

32:18.300 --> 32:22.396
And the worst part is,
you didn't even know
you were doing it.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.730
(Faint singing)

32:27.740 --> 32:32.439
Do you hear that?
(Singing continues)

32:47.320 --> 32:49.584
Audrey: Noah!
Help...

32:49.590 --> 32:52.286
Hey, Noah,
we're almost in!

32:55.430 --> 32:57.591
(Groans)
Help!

32:57.600 --> 33:00.933
Noah, we're almost there!
Hang on!

33:02.370 --> 33:03.667
Hey!
Oh, my god.

33:03.670 --> 33:07.538
Are you real?
Yeah, buddy,
we're real. Come on.

33:07.550 --> 33:10.439
You're okay.
Come here.

33:12.520 --> 33:15.648
I... I thought I was dead!
So did we, foster.

33:15.650 --> 33:17.413
I wasn't alone.
I heard Zoe.

33:17.420 --> 33:20.856
Zoe: Somebody help me!
She's down there still.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.418
What? Hold on, Noah!

33:22.430 --> 33:26.457
All right, ready?
One, two, three!

33:27.500 --> 33:30.822

33:32.670 --> 33:35.833
Please! Somebody help me!

33:35.840 --> 33:37.808
Zoe's buried alive, too.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.904
Please, somebody help me!

33:44.650 --> 33:47.517
Yeah, and there's water.
She must be
at wren lake somewhere.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.340
That's where I was
attacked, too. Wren lake.

33:49.350 --> 33:51.739
This has all been about
you and me and PIper.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.719
The dock?
Yes. Come on.
It's not far. Let's go.

33:55.930 --> 33:58.626
Dude, he's bleeding a lot.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I really am.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.349
Okay, um, we're gonna turn
around, and we're gonna go
to the hospital.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.361
Noah: No!
No, it's fine.
We're gonna call the cops

34:03.370 --> 34:05.520
and they will get Zoe.
He said no cops.
We do no cops.

34:05.540 --> 34:09.601
We can't...
We have to keep going.
Noah, you got stabbed!

34:09.610 --> 34:12.363
We save Zoe. No hospital!

34:12.380 --> 34:13.870
Okay, we keep going.

34:13.880 --> 34:17.646
Help! Please help me!

34:20.120 --> 34:23.112
(Flies buzzing, faint)

34:23.120 --> 34:26.419
(Buzzing grows louder)

34:48.650 --> 34:50.402
Jesus".

34:59.490 --> 35:01.378
She's gotta
be here somewhere!

35:01.390 --> 35:04.621
Please! Somebody help!

35:05.060 --> 35:06.527
Wait. Look over there!

35:06.530 --> 35:10.728
Help me!
She's still alive! Hurry!

35:18.180 --> 35:19.772
Hang on, Zoe! We got you!

35:19.780 --> 35:22.601
Hey, Zoe,
can you hear us?
Zoe!

35:28.790 --> 35:31.645
Zoe? Wha...?

35:32.460 --> 35:33.984
No...

35:33.990 --> 35:39.121
Please! Help me!

35:39.130 --> 35:41.826
Somebody help!

35:41.830 --> 35:43.866
No...

35:43.870 --> 35:46.430
Oh, my god...

36:00.050 --> 36:03.611
Emma, please call me
back right away.

36:10.830 --> 36:15.028
You were right.
The carcass does appear
to be missing its heart.

36:17.370 --> 36:19.622
And the hand?
Male, average size.

36:19.640 --> 36:23.030
It could be a match
for Seth Branson.

36:29.750 --> 36:33.743
Hey, Ijust got a call
from wren lake.
You should come with me.

36:33.750 --> 36:34.910
Do you know this place?

36:34.920 --> 36:36.888
I used to bring
Emma and Audrey here.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.039
This feels personal.

36:38.060 --> 36:40.483
Maybe, but we should
get to wren lake now.

36:40.490 --> 36:43.823
Why?
Emma's there.

36:44.460 --> 36:47.554
Man:
no matter where you go,
I 7/ find you

36:47.560 --> 36:52.759
no matter where you go,
I 7/ find you

36:52.770 --> 36:55.933
I 7/ find you

36:57.110 --> 37:00.079

37:00.080 --> 37:03.345

37:03.350 --> 37:05.739

37:05.750 --> 37:08.844

37:08.850 --> 37:11.717

37:17.590 --> 37:21.549

37:24.030 --> 37:26.794

(Phone ringIng)

37:26.800 --> 37:31.032
...for your life
(Ringing continues)

37:34.110 --> 37:39.571
We played your game
and we followed your rules
and you still killed Zoe.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.616
I always win.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.110
You're gonna lose
in the end.

37:43.120 --> 37:46.453
Real/y?
Look at the evidence.

37:46.460 --> 37:48.849
You ’re dead in the water.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.491
Hey. I brought you
some aspirin.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.024
Thanks.

38:52.820 --> 38:55.550
Zoe's dead
because of us.

38:55.930 --> 38:57.852
That's not true.

39:02.170 --> 39:06.197
The killer is after
me and Audrey.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.133
He did what he did
to get to us.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.631
That's not your fault.

39:13.640 --> 39:17.007
You didn't choose
any of this.

39:17.010 --> 39:18.671
Maybe.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.781
But, if we want it
to stop...

39:24.620 --> 39:26.485
It's on us.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.748
It's on me.

39:31.930 --> 39:36.629
It's not.
It's not on you.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.949
(Tapping on window)

41:01.820 --> 41:09.818
(Suspenseful music playing)
