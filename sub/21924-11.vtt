on "Heartland."

 The yin and the yang
of our Mongolian flag.

00:09.509 --> 00:12.345
You can have darkness, Tim,
but you need light, too.

00:12.470 --> 00:15.390
It's a balance between
them that can change lives.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.981
 Hey, we've got to talk.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.065
 [sighs] No, we don't.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071
 We need to take a step back.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.531
 Are you breaking up with me?

00:32.656 --> 00:35.910
 It's for the best.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.497
[music playing]

[cows mooing]

01:10.862 --> 01:14.032
 [gasps] Ty?

01:14.157 --> 01:16.868
Ty?

01:16.993 --> 01:18.745
 Amy, you OK?

01:18.870 --> 01:20.205
 Yeah.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.790
I was in the desert and
I couldn't find you.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.209
And I was looking and I
didn't know where you were.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.544
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.962
It was a dream,
Amy, it was a dream.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.589
You found me, remember?

01:29.714 --> 01:31.299
 I know I did, but--

01:31.424 --> 01:33.468
well, what if I hadn't?

01:33.593 --> 01:34.636
What if you were still there?

01:34.761 --> 01:37.931
What-- what if--
what if I lost you.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.266
 I would've found my way home.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.142
OK?

01:41.267 --> 01:42.936
I wouldn't have given up.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.940
I would've fought my way back to
you and Lyndy, no matter what.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.149
 Yeah.

01:56.408 --> 02:00.161
Don't leave me.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.121
 I'm right here.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.040
 I love you.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.834
 Sorry to just
drop in like this.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.502
 Oh, don't apologize.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.713
You're welcome here any time.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.340
 Thank you.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.884
So have you heard word from Tim?

02:15.010 --> 02:17.429
How's he doing in Mongolia?

02:17.554 --> 02:22.809
 Well, he got back
a few days ago and--

02:22.934 --> 02:25.979
he didn't tell you.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.732
 No.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.691
 Is everything OK?

02:32.652 --> 02:36.489
 Look, I hate to
drag you into this.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.701
Tim broke things off with
me right before he left.

02:39.826 --> 02:45.790
He said a bunch of stuff and
not a lot of it made any sense.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.210
I want to talk to him, but,
clearly, he's avoiding me.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.882
 Yeah, I'm sorry
to hear that, Casey.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.091
 Would you tell him I came by?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.552
 Of course.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.220
 I should go.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.347
Thanks for the coffee.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.686
[door creaking]

03:13.526 --> 03:16.071
AMY: Great job, Georgie.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.280
 Thanks.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.740
 No, I am serious!

03:18.865 --> 03:20.658
That was one of the best
rides I've seen you do.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.203
 [sighs] I wasn't
straight enough.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.871
I wasn't in the middle
of the last fence.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.707
 OK, I guess there's
always room for improvement.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.959
But Georgie that
was a great ride.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.127
 I could have done better.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.462
 What's going on?

03:32.587 --> 03:33.630
Why are you being
so hard on yourself?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.256
Does this have something
to do with Val?

03:35.382 --> 03:36.716
 She was furious
when she found out I

03:36.841 --> 03:38.301
placed third at the last show.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.053
 Third is nothing
to be ashamed of.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.179
I'm going to have
a talk with her.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.222
 No!
No, please don't!

03:42.347 --> 03:43.515
You make things worse.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.600
Besides, she's not
entirely wrong.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.812
I wasn't focused and I let my
nerves get the better of me.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.524
I'm not going to let that
happen this time, though.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.442
I-- I need to go
get ready for work.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.694
Thanks for the practice.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.445
 Georgie, hey.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.073
I hope that between
work and jumping you're

04:00.198 --> 04:01.741
finding some time to relax?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.785
 I'll relax after I
win the Fall Finale.

AMY: Hey!

04:13.211 --> 04:15.463
Hi, sweetheart!

04:15.588 --> 04:18.466
[chuckles] How are you?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.135
 Well, she's not as
talkative as she normally is.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.136
- No?
- No.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.303
 Can you say Dada?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.097
Is daddy looking for an encore?

04:24.222 --> 04:25.015
Yeah, Dada.

04:25.140 --> 04:25.932
[growling]

04:26.057 --> 04:27.017
Ty, the dog!

04:27.142 --> 04:29.561
Jasper, no!

04:29.686 --> 04:30.478
Seriously?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.022
 This is the second time today.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.690
 At this rate, we're not
going to have any clothes

04:33.815 --> 04:35.442
left by the end of the week.

04:35.567 --> 04:38.111
Next time Caleb and Cassandra
ask you to dog sit, you say no.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.238
 I know, OK.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.115
 Oh, great.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.283
 What?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.789
 I booked a client
for this afternoon

04:49.914 --> 04:51.833
and, of course, they're early.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.460
 It's OK, go.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.753
 OK.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.421
You be good, OK?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.423
Good for Dada.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.258
Dada!

05:00.383 --> 05:01.426
- Come on, Lyndy.
- Keep trying.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.469
- Come on, Lyndy.
- All right.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.845
- Come on.
- Bye, Jasper.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.846
Be good.

05:04.971 --> 05:05.889
 Here you go.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.307
 Thank you, thanks.

 [sighs]

05:17.150 --> 05:20.028
 Hey, Georgie.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.321
 Hey.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.115
 Um, so I just
got back into town.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.367
Uh, I called you.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.035
Did you get my message?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.912
 Yeah, I did.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.748
 Yeah, uh, look, I--

05:31.873 --> 05:33.667
I know that you're
mad at me right now.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.043
But just for
whatever it's worth,

05:35.168 --> 05:37.170
I ended things with
that girl in Calgary.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.130
I-- I know I should
have done that sooner.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.965
I messed up.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.050
I'm sorry.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.135
 No, It's OK.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.011
It's fine.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.681
I'm over it.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.224
 Really?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.434
That's-- that's great.

05:51.559 --> 05:56.481
Um, so can things go back
to the way they used to be?

05:56.606 --> 06:00.902
 No, they can't.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.195
Goodbye, Wyatt.

[music playing]

06:10.870 --> 06:12.330
 There you are.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.707
I've been looking for you.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.671
Casey came out to the
house this morning.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.922
 Yeah.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.216
 She didn't even
know you were back.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.260
 Well, we're not
together anymore.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.722
 Yeah, she said as much.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.517
Look, you and Casey,
that's none of my business.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.895
But I'm worried about you.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.273
Did you get your test results
back from the doctor yet?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.650
 Yeah.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.861
You want the good
news or the bad news?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.529
 Let's start with the good.

06:44.654 --> 06:48.158
 Good news is that
that thing on my brain

06:48.283 --> 06:50.368
hasn't gotten any bigger.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.411
 OK.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.537
And the bad?

06:52.662 --> 06:53.788
 It's still there.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.418
So what now?

06:58.543 --> 07:01.171
 I don't know.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.589
Just wait and see, I guess.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.050
 And what about Amy and Lou?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.426
 What about them?

07:06.551 --> 07:08.762
 Well, when are you
going to tell them?

07:08.887 --> 07:11.056
 I'm not going to tell them.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.766
And neither are you, Jack.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.226
 Making me keep this
secret, that's not fair.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.978
 Come on!

07:17.103 --> 07:18.646
 It's not fair to me, and
it's not fair to your girls.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.691
They deserve to know
what's going on.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.985
 Don't you tell me
about what's fair.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.496
[theme - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

07:45.799 --> 07:53.306

day, you sank into your dream.

issues with trail rides, huh?

going to hurt you.

There you go.

Good!

You're fine.

 It's quiet around
here without Katie, huh?

 Yeah.

 How's she's
doing in Vancouver?

 Well, last I heard
they were having a ball.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.280
 OK, I am off to this meeting.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.450
How I got wrangled into
organizing anything with Val

09:35.575 --> 09:36.451
Stanton I'll never know.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.994
I must be crazy.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.371
 Good luck.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.664
 So I know tomorrow's calf
weaning day, very busy,

09:41.790 --> 09:43.291
but if there's any
chance you got off early,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.168
then I would love it if
you would come with me.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.713
 I'll do my best, but I'm
not going to promise anything.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.131
 I understand.
All right.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.257
I'll see you two later.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.811

the Hudson Hunt Club.

10:02.936 --> 10:07.774
It's like a-- it's like a fox
hunt, except there's no foxes.

10:07.899 --> 10:08.817
There's no dogs.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.944
They don't even hunt anything.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.072
 Well, we don't have to
wean the calves tomorrow.

10:14.197 --> 10:14.906
They can wait

10:15.031 --> 10:17.367
 Wha-- no, I know that.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.743
And you know that.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.870
But I'm using it as
an excuse not to go.

Riding around in
the countryside,

of brandy, that's

10:24.708 --> 10:26.292

10:26.418 --> 10:28.837
 Well, it's obviously
important to her.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.089
 What am I missing here?

10:31.214 --> 10:33.466
Why aren't you busting
my chops right about now.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.511
There must be a dozen jokes you
could make about an old cowboy

10:36.636 --> 10:39.180
wearing leotard pants.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.765
What?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.434
 I pictured it.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.185
It's not pretty.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.522
Jack, don't miss an opportunity
to be with your wife.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.232
Come on!

10:49.357 --> 10:50.358
Just because you're scared
to try something different,

10:50.483 --> 10:51.359
that's no way to live.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.360
 Yeah.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.571
You're one to give advice.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.449
 Yeah, you're right.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.367
Forget I said anything.

As you know the Westfields
said we could hold the first

11:10.128 --> 11:11.379
meet of the year
on their property.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.297
 Yep.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.090
 Oh!

11:14.215 --> 11:16.176
Um, Brian and Paula, they're not
going to be in town by the way.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.719
But their nephew,
Dylan, has agreed

11:17.844 --> 11:18.845
to act as one of the officials.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.013
 Oh, OK.
Well, that's nice.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.473
 Mm-mm, yep.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.599
The Westfield estate's so
beautiful this time of year.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.059
 Hm.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.020
 So we need to pick
a midpoint rest stop.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.521
And I think there's
a couple of options.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.814
 Oh!

11:29.939 --> 11:31.566
I also wanted to tell you.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.904
[chuckles] Because Brian isn't
able to be the field master,

11:36.029 --> 11:37.739
Dan is going to take his place.

11:37.864 --> 11:38.656
 Dan, my Dan?

11:38.782 --> 11:39.532
 Yeah.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.618
 My ex, Dan?

11:41.743 --> 11:42.827
Oh!

11:42.952 --> 11:44.037
[chuckles]
- Is that a problem?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.288
 No.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.247
 Is there something
I should know about?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.415
 No, no.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.750
It's just funny.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.085
All right, so--

11:54.381 --> 11:55.298
 Hey, grandpa.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.424
I got your message.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.927
What did you want
to talk to me about?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.762
 I'm wondering if you
might have a little time you

12:00.887 --> 12:02.847
could spare for me later today?

12:02.972 --> 12:03.682
 Yeah, for sure.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.058
What for?

12:05.183 --> 12:06.309
 Well, I need you
to do me a favor,

12:06.434 --> 12:08.144
but you have to keep
it under your hat.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.396
 OK.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.064
What kind of favor?

12:11.189 --> 12:12.732
 [chuckles]

12:16.027 --> 12:18.697
 You're doing good,
grandpa, just like--

12:18.822 --> 12:20.073
relax a little.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.616
 How am I supposed to relax?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.326
I'm sitting on a postage stamp.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.996
 [laughs] I know it's not easy
going from Western to English,

12:27.122 --> 12:28.873
but you look good.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.918
 Now I know why the
British came here.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.129
They were searching for
more comfortable saddles.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.088
[horse whinnies]

12:35.213 --> 12:36.297
 Whoa, easy.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.590
Hey, hey.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.508
[horse whinnies]

12:38.633 --> 12:40.927
You're OK.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.804
 What's his problem?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.806
 Well, he's an
off-the-track racehorse.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.516
I'm trying to get him
used to trail rides.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.935
But I think it's the trees
that are freaking him out.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.229
 Too much time
standing in a stall.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.772
 Exactly.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.483
His owner wants to re-home
him, so I'm thinking of maybe

12:55.608 --> 12:57.152
trying to make him an eventer?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.612
 Well, you think he's
got any jump in him?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.741
 There's only one
way to find out.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.826
Hey, there's a good starter log.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.120
OK, you first.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.038
 Me?

13:08.163 --> 13:10.081
[scoffs] I don't think so.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.833
 Grandpa, jumps are
going to be a big part

13:11.958 --> 13:13.168
of the hunt tomorrow.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.961
 Well, I'll just go
around them, I guess.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.171
 OK, suit yourself.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.968
 Wow!

13:22.093 --> 13:24.179
Well, he didn't shy at that.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.644
 That looked pretty good.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.313
 Yeah!

13:33.438 --> 13:34.439
Yeah, buddy!

13:34.564 --> 13:36.608
Good job!

13:36.733 --> 13:40.153
Hey, grandpa do you think
that maybe there's still time

13:40.278 --> 13:41.905
to enter the Hunt Club ride?

13:42.030 --> 13:43.281
 I wouldn't know.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.325
Why, do you think
he's ready for that?

13:45.450 --> 13:47.369
 There's going to be a lot
of potential buyers there.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.996
And if he performs well,
then I might be able to find

13:50.121 --> 13:51.122
a new home for him.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.166
 Well, I'll mention it to Lisa.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.000
 OK.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.629
Hey, get back at it!

13:57.754 --> 13:58.546
 [groans]

13:58.672 --> 13:59.547
 [giggles]

13:59.673 --> 14:00.548
 Git.

14:00.674 --> 14:04.052
[music playing]

14:06.930 --> 14:09.140
 Hey, brown eyes.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.434
 Hey!

14:11.559 --> 14:14.396
 What do you know about
the Hudson Hunt Club?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.271
 I know it's tomorrow.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.399
Some of my family are going.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.651
 How about you
come along with me?

14:19.776 --> 14:22.904
Save me from my uncle and
auntie's stuffy friends?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.572
 Sorry, I can't.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.949
I have to school Flame tomorrow.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.034
And besides, Val's
going to be there, and--

14:28.159 --> 14:30.036
 Take some time off.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.204
Have some fun.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.623
And don't let Val
ruin it for you.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.917
I could also lend you a
good cross-country horse

14:36.042 --> 14:37.711
if you need one.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.588
 I already have a
cross-country horse, Phoenix.

14:40.714 --> 14:45.468
 So I guess I'll see you
and Phoenix tomorrow, then.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.179
 OK.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.265
 Well, I think that pretty
much wraps it up, eh?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.516
 Yep.

14:51.641 --> 14:52.892
 If you think of
anything, give me a call.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.728
 I will.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.563
Did you manage to convince
that husband of yours

14:56.688 --> 14:57.439
to join us tomorrow?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.481
 Oh, no.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.191
He's, uh, weaning
calves tomorrow.

15:00.316 --> 15:00.984
Very busy.

15:01.109 --> 15:01.943
 Of course, he is.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.528
I'm not a bit surprised.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.363
Jack's always been
set in his ways.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.531
 Yeah.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.033
 Uh, Lisa?

15:08.158 --> 15:09.659
Just before you go.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.496
It just occurred to me
that if I'm not mistaken,

15:13.621 --> 15:16.249
the last hunt Dan would
have taken part in

15:16.374 --> 15:19.461
was just before
your divorce, right?

15:19.586 --> 15:23.006
I-- I just hope this
isn't too awkward for you.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.215
 No, Val.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.800
It's not.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.469
And besides, nothing could be
more awkward than last year,

15:27.594 --> 15:28.386
right?

15:28.511 --> 15:29.429
[chuckles]

15:29.554 --> 15:31.222
 No, what happened?

15:31.348 --> 15:32.807
 Val, don't you remember?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.768
You drank so much you
almost fell off your horse.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.645
[chuckles] See you tomorrow.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.272
 [huffs]

15:41.274 --> 15:42.567
 Thanks.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.319
 Dylan Westfield.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.613
Congratulations on your big win.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.865
 Thank you, um,
Georgie and Flame really

15:48.990 --> 15:50.241
gave me a run for my money.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.660
 I don't know about that.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.621
I haven't been all that
impressed with George's

15:54.746 --> 15:56.331
level of commitment lately.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.625
I'm not sure she's in
this for the long haul.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.629
In fact, Flame may need
a new rider one day soon.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.383
Anyway, uh, I also wanted
to say how sorry I am.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.467
 About what?

16:07.592 --> 16:11.012
 I hear your horse,
Arrow, was lame.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.473
 I noticed he was in
pain on the last ride.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.308
My vet's running
some tests on him.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.976
 Hm.

16:17.102 --> 16:20.355
Well, if it turns out Arrow
can't compete anymore,

16:20.480 --> 16:21.564
we should talk.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.358
I might have the
perfect horse for you.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.040
LISA: Honey, I'm on my way.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.379
Jack?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.714
JACK: Yeah, I'll be right out.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.048
 Oki-doke.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.725
You're coming?

16:56.850 --> 17:00.854
[gasps] Oh, my goodness!

17:00.979 --> 17:02.230
 What do you think?

17:02.355 --> 17:05.900
 You look so handsome.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.902
Where did you get everything?

17:08.028 --> 17:12.906
 Well, I borrowed the pants
and I bought the boots.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.367
 You did?

17:14.492 --> 17:16.411
 And I just pieced the
rest of it together.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.580
 Oh, Jack, I--

17:19.705 --> 17:20.498
it's perfect!

17:20.623 --> 17:21.875
 [chuckles]

17:22.000 --> 17:23.126
 Thank you!

17:23.251 --> 17:25.295
 Well, this whole
Hunt Club thing's

17:25.420 --> 17:28.506
a little outside my
wheelhouse, but I

17:28.631 --> 17:30.258
know how much it means to you.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.219
 Oh, I can't believe it!

17:33.345 --> 17:37.724
I'm so glad you're coming with
me so we can face Dan together.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.100
 What?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.602
 Oh, yeah.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.895
He, uh, is coming.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.106
And the worst part is, is
that he's Field Master.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.232
 What does that mean?

17:46.358 --> 17:47.484
 That he's in charge.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.693
 Oh, Lisa!

17:48.818 --> 17:50.153
 I know, I know it's annoying.
I'm sorry.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.363
But you know what?
It's going to be fine.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.617
And you look just spectacular!

17:55.742 --> 17:57.077
I'm just going to grab
a couple of things.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.661
I'll be right back.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.373
 [chuckles] [sighs]

18:01.498 --> 18:02.290
 OK, dad.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.541
Lyndy should wake up any minute.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.085
 There's green bean
and carrot puree

18:05.210 --> 18:06.461
in the fridge for her lunch.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.254
 And make sure you wash
out her bottles, OK?

18:08.380 --> 18:09.881
There's bibs kind of anywhere.

18:10.006 --> 18:10.715
Where's her teething ring?

18:10.840 --> 18:11.758
 It's right here.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.426
 Oh, perfect.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.053
 And make sure you take Jasper
for a walk in a few hours.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.179
- Yes.
- But keep him on a leash.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.472
 And don't let him
near the pillows.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.473
He likes those.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.141
 Or shoes for that matter.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.059
 Or these!

18:21.184 --> 18:22.018
[groans]

18:22.143 --> 18:23.603
 Or Lyndy.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.563
Actually, just keep an eye
on him for all the time.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.898
 OK.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.525
I got it.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.943
- Ty.
- OK.

18:30.068 --> 18:30.985
Oh!

18:31.111 --> 18:32.112
Thank you.
- Love you.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.863
- Love you too.
- Have a good day.

18:33.988 --> 18:34.781
 Thank you.

18:34.906 --> 18:35.699
 Bye.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.618
 [chuckles]

18:38.743 --> 18:40.620
 Haven't seen you dressed
like that for a while.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.915
 Yeah, I'm, uh, riding a
client's horse at the hunt

18:44.040 --> 18:46.918
today, so I figured
I'd dress the part.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.046
Dad, I wanted to thank you.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.631
 Oh, honey, I'll
babysit anytime.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.800
 Not just for babysitting, Dad.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.594
Thank you for coming
with me to Mongolia.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.930
Thank you for riding into
the middle of the desert

18:59.055 --> 19:01.307
to help me find Ty.

19:01.433 --> 19:04.227
You're always there
when I need you.

19:04.352 --> 19:08.648
I honestly don't know
what I do without you.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.649
 I love you.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.151
 Love you too.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.318
Have fun.
- OK.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.361
 You look great.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.154
 Thanks.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.031
 And we'll have fun.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.365
Won't we, Jasper?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.998
 Hey.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.125
I know you hate me right now,
but could you please just

19:27.250 --> 19:29.210
give me a chance to explain?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.004
 This isn't a good time.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.005
 Do you have a
show or something?

19:32.130 --> 19:33.131
 No.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.299
I'm going to a Hunt Club meet.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.134
 That's the one
at the Westfields?

19:36.259 --> 19:37.677
 Yeah.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.554
 Is that guy Dylan
going to be there?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.014
 Probably.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.558
 Well, have fun hobnobbing
with the rich and horsey.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.646
I just hope that you don't
think that those people are

19:48.772 --> 19:50.523
your friends.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.525
 What is that supposed to mean?

19:52.650 --> 19:54.861
 I saw that lady who owns
Flame talking to Dylan.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.404
 So?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.239
 So she was
complaining about you.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.408
 Yeah, what else is new.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.077
 She wants Dylan to
ride one of her horses.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.912
[music playing]

20:04.037 --> 20:05.413
 That doesn't make any sense.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.749
Dylan already has an
amazing horse, Arrow.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.793
 Yeah, well, but there's
something wrong with Arrow.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.503
He's lame.

20:11.628 --> 20:12.796
 Stop it.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.423
 I'm just telling
you what I heard.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.092
 No, you're trying to
make it sound like Dylan

20:17.217 --> 20:18.551
is going after Flame.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.179
 Yeah well, that seems
pretty obvious to me.

20:21.304 --> 20:22.472
 Val has a lot of horses.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.099
She gets people
like Dylan to show

20:24.224 --> 20:25.767
them to increase their value.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.936
All you overheard was
Val doing some business.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.270
It has nothing to do with Flame.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.731
 Are sure about that?

20:31.856 --> 20:33.149
 Hey, Georgie.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.401
We should probably
get Phoenix loaded

20:34.526 --> 20:35.735
or we're going to
miss the start.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.778
Hey.
- Hi.

20:36.903 --> 20:37.946
Goodbye.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.447
OK, I should probably go.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.162
 The duck says--

20:46.287 --> 20:47.539
end.

20:47.664 --> 20:52.127
And I think you know why.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.712
The end.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.256
You like stories, don't you?

20:56.381 --> 20:59.300
Well, let's see
what else we have.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.557
Come here, let's look.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.392
Hi.

21:07.517 --> 21:08.768
What book do you like?

21:08.893 --> 21:10.645
Let's see what
we've got over here.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.230
What's this one?

21:12.355 --> 21:14.983
Maybe-- maybe not.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.486
[music playing]

21:22.323 --> 21:26.244
[sighs] How about
I tell you a story

21:26.369 --> 21:28.580
about your Grandma Marion.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.791
Once upon a time, there
was a beautiful princess.

21:31.916 --> 21:32.584
Yes.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.294
And her name was Marion.

21:34.419 --> 21:37.756
And she was the most beautiful
princess in all the land.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.592
[sighs] And she had a gift.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.428
She could talk to horses.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.388
And they listened to her.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.514
It was like magic.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.644
One day, Marion met a Prince.

21:51.770 --> 21:52.937
Well, she thought
he was a Prince,

21:53.063 --> 21:54.856
but it turns out he
was broken inside.

21:59.069 --> 22:05.200
But she and the Prince had
two beautiful daughters.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.494
Princess Lou, your aunt.

22:07.619 --> 22:12.582
And Princess Amy, your mom.

22:12.707 --> 22:18.546
And Amy was just like
Marion in almost every way

22:18.672 --> 22:21.549
because she was beautiful too.

22:21.675 --> 22:24.302
And she had the same gift.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.471
She could talk to horses.

22:26.596 --> 22:27.639
And they listened.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.520
Almost like magic.

22:33.645 --> 22:37.482
I wish you could have
met your grandma.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.359
She would have
loved you so much.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.823
She would have
loved you so much.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.163
Yep.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.750
[music playing]

22:56.710 --> 22:57.335
 Jack!

22:57.460 --> 22:58.336
Jack!

22:58.461 --> 22:59.254
You see what I'm seeing?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.213
 What?

23:00.338 --> 23:01.506
 Look!

23:01.631 --> 23:03.883
Dan and Val are all
over each other!

23:04.009 --> 23:04.968
 So?

23:05.093 --> 23:08.513
 He does not beat
anyone over 35.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.348
He is so up to something.

23:10.473 --> 23:11.933
 Maybe he just likes her.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.269
 Oh, come on!

23:14.394 --> 23:16.396
Yep, he is-- oh, you know what?

23:16.521 --> 23:17.939
I know exactly what he's doing.

23:18.064 --> 23:18.898
 Oh, here we go.

23:19.024 --> 23:19.983
 No, no, wait.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.484
He called me last
week and asked me

23:21.609 --> 23:22.777
to invest in some
shady business scheme

23:22.902 --> 23:24.279
he's got himself involved in.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.823
And when I said no, he
got kind of desperate.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.199
Do you know what he's doing?

23:28.324 --> 23:29.951
I bet you anything, he's
got his grubby hands

23:30.076 --> 23:31.244
all over Val's assets.

23:31.369 --> 23:35.373
 Or for all you know,
they're madly in love.

23:35.498 --> 23:36.791
 Stop it.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.585
The person Dan's in
love with is himself.

23:38.710 --> 23:39.627
Actually, you know what?

23:39.753 --> 23:42.255
They're perfect for each other.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.215
And here they come.

23:44.341 --> 23:45.633
Dummy up.

23:45.759 --> 23:49.471
 Well-- is that really
you, Jack Bartlett?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.264
 Last time I checked.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.808
 I guess you can teach an
old dog new tricks, huh?

23:53.933 --> 23:54.726
JACK: [chuckles]

23:54.851 --> 23:57.145
 It's good to see you, Jack.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.482
Lisa, the last time we
ran on a hunt together,

24:00.607 --> 24:02.942
I think we were still married.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.235
 Mm-hmm, well,
that would indicate

24:04.361 --> 24:07.030
just how long ago it was.

24:07.155 --> 24:11.951
 Yeah, I'm just so honored
they made me Field Master.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.787
Oh, Jack, that's kind
of like being the trail

24:13.912 --> 24:16.039
boss on a cattle drive.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.208
 Well, I appreciate you
putting that in the terms

24:18.333 --> 24:20.001
I can understand.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.670
 Oh, and just so you know, the
penalty for passing the Field

24:21.795 --> 24:24.964
Master is a case of champagne.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.133
And the rules are pretty
strictly enforced.

24:27.258 --> 24:31.137
 Well, you know, Dan, if you
passed me on a cattle drive,

24:31.262 --> 24:33.264
I'd probably just shoot you.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.684
[laughing]

24:35.809 --> 24:38.019
But a case of champagne,
that's good too.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.606
 Well, we'll see you out there.

24:41.731 --> 24:42.774
 All right.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.736
 He's got such
a great attitude.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.321
I hope you can find
a good home for him.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.323
 Yeah, so do I.
Hopefully, someone

24:50.448 --> 24:51.658
here will see his potential.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.159
That's if you're on
your best behavior,

24:53.284 --> 24:54.285
though, right, Oliver?

24:54.411 --> 24:55.328
[chuckles]

24:55.453 --> 24:56.413
 Hey, Georgie, Amy.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.372
 Hey, Dylan.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.790
Good to see you.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.917
 Ah, so you're back
in the country, I see.

25:01.042 --> 25:01.876
 Hello, Val.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.340
 We need to talk seriously
about Georgie's training.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.591
 Yes, we do.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.260
 I'll meet you at
the halfway point.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.469
- OK.
- Dylan?

25:11.594 --> 25:12.595
 Mm-mm.

25:12.721 --> 25:13.847
 Please start to
gather everyone.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.390
 OK.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.559
 Do you think she even noticed
I'm standing right here?

25:17.684 --> 25:20.395
 Forget about her and let's
just have some fun today.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.480
Maybe we can take a few
of the jumps together.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.065
 If you can keep up with me,

25:24.190 --> 25:27.736
[music playing]

25:28.611 --> 25:30.697
 Welcome, everyone.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.408
And thank you to the
Westfields for hosting

25:33.533 --> 25:35.994
us at their beautiful property.

25:36.119 --> 25:38.997
A few quick rules
before we get started.

25:39.122 --> 25:41.249
You're riding at your own risk.

25:41.374 --> 25:45.587
The whips in the red
coats are here to help.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.006
So please take
direction from them.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.759
If your horse becomes
a danger to others,

25:50.884 --> 25:53.928
you will be excused
from the ride.

25:54.054 --> 25:54.888
 Hey.
Hey.

25:55.013 --> 25:55.889
Hey!

25:56.014 --> 25:56.598
Settle down.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.266
 You OK there?

25:58.391 --> 26:00.935
 Yup, I'm fine.

26:01.061 --> 26:04.773
 If you're not jumping,
just please stay to the back.

26:04.898 --> 26:08.443
And, lastly, have fun!

26:08.568 --> 26:13.531
Oh, and please, keep your horse
between you and the ground.

26:13.656 --> 26:16.201
In other words, don't fall off.

26:16.326 --> 26:17.369
[chuckles]

26:17.494 --> 26:18.453
[chuckling]
[music playing]

26:18.578 --> 26:19.579
All right.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.956
Let's get this show on the road.

26:22.082 --> 26:25.627
[bugle sounding]

27:02.455 --> 27:03.331
 Looking good, grandpa!

27:12.966 --> 27:16.302
 [sighs]

27:36.656 --> 27:40.827
[groans]

27:41.745 --> 27:44.789
 Hello, Tim.

27:44.914 --> 27:48.376
 [clears throat] What
are you doing here?

27:48.501 --> 27:50.628
 I want to know why you
ended things the way you did.

27:50.754 --> 27:53.423
[music playing]

27:53.548 --> 27:54.674
I want the truth.

27:54.799 --> 27:55.800
And I'm not leaving
until I get it.

28:03.016 --> 28:04.351
 So you want a coffee?

28:04.476 --> 28:05.727
 No.

28:05.852 --> 28:06.978
 Do you want me to
make you a sandwich?

28:09.522 --> 28:11.900
There's-- there's pablum
in the fridge, Lyndy--

28:12.025 --> 28:12.692
 Tim.

28:12.817 --> 28:14.235
 What?

28:14.361 --> 28:16.321
 Stop it.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.781
 Why are you here?

28:17.906 --> 28:19.657
Do you want me to break up
with you again, is that it?

28:19.783 --> 28:21.993
 I don't know, maybe.

28:22.118 --> 28:25.246
But this time maybe
no half-baked excuses

28:25.372 --> 28:29.376
about stepping back
and wanting space.

28:29.501 --> 28:30.710
There's something
going on with you.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.878
And I want to know what it is.

28:34.798 --> 28:35.715
 No, no!

28:35.840 --> 28:36.883
Jasper!

28:37.008 --> 28:38.510
Wait, wait!
Oh!

28:38.635 --> 28:39.511
Don't!

28:39.636 --> 28:40.804
He ate chocolates!

28:40.929 --> 28:42.347
He ate-- he ate a
lot of chocolate!

28:42.472 --> 28:43.264
Oh, come here, boy.

28:43.390 --> 28:44.140
Come on!

28:44.265 --> 28:45.850
Oh, that's poison to a dog!

28:45.975 --> 28:47.686
Oh, I got to take
him to the vet,

28:47.811 --> 28:49.104
he-- this could be bad for him.

28:49.229 --> 28:50.188
Will you stay with Lyndy?

28:50.313 --> 28:51.106
 No!

28:51.231 --> 28:51.940
 What?

28:52.065 --> 28:54.734
 I'm coming with you.

28:54.859 --> 28:56.319
 Excuse me.

28:56.444 --> 28:57.862
If you don't like the weather,
wait five minutes, huh?

28:57.987 --> 29:00.407
 [chuckles] I think
it's beautiful.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.867
Speaking of which, that
is a lovely animal.

29:02.992 --> 29:03.952
 Thank you.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.579
 He's a little green.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.123
But he moves m really well.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.916
 Yeah, he's a
smooth jumper, too.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.376
 Is he one of yours?

29:11.501 --> 29:12.836
 A client's.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.504
I'm actually supposed to
find a new home for him.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.339
 Oh.

29:16.464 --> 29:18.550
Well, I know a few people who
might be interested in a horse

29:18.675 --> 29:19.843
like this.

29:19.968 --> 29:20.593
I'll pass your
information along.

29:20.719 --> 29:21.469
 Thank you.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.471
 Mm-mm.

29:23.596 --> 29:24.431
About Georgie.

29:27.058 --> 29:29.394
I know you think I'm
being too hard on her.

29:29.519 --> 29:33.106
It's just that I see so much
potential in her and in Flame.

29:33.231 --> 29:35.275
I know she worked
wonders in the beginning.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.446
But now, lately,
they're coasting.

29:39.571 --> 29:41.406
I don't think she wants
this badly enough.

29:41.531 --> 29:42.449
 She does.

29:42.574 --> 29:43.742
Believe me.

29:43.867 --> 29:44.951
There is nothing
Georgie wants more

29:45.076 --> 29:46.703
than to win the Fall Finale.

29:46.828 --> 29:50.331
 Well, I'm glad to hear it.

29:50.457 --> 29:54.085
I tell you what, I'm going to
come to a training session.

29:54.210 --> 29:56.254
I expect to be impressed.

29:56.379 --> 29:57.172
 You will be.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.302
 Ty?

30:02.427 --> 30:03.553
Ty!

30:03.678 --> 30:04.637
Hey.

30:04.763 --> 30:05.805
 Tim, what-- what happened?

30:05.930 --> 30:08.099
 He got into a
box of chocolates.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.518
Lyndy's with Casey, so she's OK.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.103
 Has there been any
vomiting or seizures?

30:12.228 --> 30:13.104
 No.

30:13.229 --> 30:15.023
 OK, well, that's a good sign.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.566
He probably didn't have
enough for a toxic dose.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.526
I'm going to wash out his
stomach just to be safe, OK?

30:18.651 --> 30:19.486
 Yeah.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.196
 Wait here.

30:21.321 --> 30:24.074
OK, here we go.

30:24.199 --> 30:27.452
 [sighs] You should have
just stayed back Lyndy.

30:27.577 --> 30:31.373
What was the point of
coming all the way out here?

30:31.498 --> 30:35.168
 Because we're going
to have a conversation.

30:35.293 --> 30:36.336
 OK.

30:36.461 --> 30:37.420
You want the truth?

30:37.545 --> 30:38.380
 Yeah, I do.

30:42.092 --> 30:44.344
 I don't love you anymore.

30:44.469 --> 30:45.804
There.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.180
You happy now?

30:47.305 --> 30:50.058
 [sighs]

30:53.478 --> 30:54.479
You are such a liar.

31:01.194 --> 31:04.114
 You know, it's not
supposed to be a race, right?

31:04.239 --> 31:05.657
 What do you mean?

31:05.782 --> 31:08.034
 I feel like you're
competing with me out there.

31:08.159 --> 31:11.454
Either that or you're
obsessed with me.

31:11.579 --> 31:12.414
Is everything OK?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.835
 You were talking
to Val yesterday?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.086
 Yeah.

31:18.211 --> 31:20.755
How did you know that?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.341
 Well, is it true about Arrow?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.719
 Yeah, it's true.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.929
Arrow came up lame.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.681
 Dylan, I'm so sorry.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.016
 It's OK.

31:31.141 --> 31:32.517
He might be fine.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.436
 Well, if he's not,
what are you going to do?

31:34.561 --> 31:36.730
 I don't know.

31:36.855 --> 31:38.898
Val said she has the
perfect horse for me.

31:39.024 --> 31:40.567
 Really?

31:40.692 --> 31:43.361
 I don't expect that
to work out, though.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.821
 Why not?

31:44.946 --> 31:48.700
 I've been training with
Arrow since I came to Hudson.

31:48.825 --> 31:53.079
We-- have a connection.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.373
That probably sounds
stupid, doesn't it?

31:55.498 --> 31:58.835
 No, that doesn't
sound stupid at all.

31:58.960 --> 32:13.099
 If Arrow is out for
the season, then so am I.

32:13.224 --> 32:14.976
 [sighs] This is ridiculous.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.397
 Where are you going?

32:19.522 --> 32:21.649
 If you're staying,
I'm leaving.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.109
Tell Ty took Lyndy for a walk.

32:23.234 --> 32:25.153
 Are you kidding me?

32:25.278 --> 32:26.780
 You're just to leave?

32:26.905 --> 32:30.325
 I've already said everything
I need to say, Casey.

32:30.450 --> 32:31.201
Goodbye.

32:31.326 --> 32:34.287
 You know what you are, Tim?

32:34.412 --> 32:36.498
[huffs] You're such a coward.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.506
[sighs]

32:52.972 --> 32:56.476
[music playing]

33:02.941 --> 33:06.361
[ominous music]

33:24.421 --> 33:27.632
ALTAN: If we fall out of
balance, there's trouble.

33:27.757 --> 33:29.551
Bad things happen.

33:29.676 --> 33:32.220
Harmful things.

33:32.345 --> 33:37.267
My job is to recognize
imbalance and fix it.

33:37.392 --> 33:41.021
And you, Tim, you
lost your balance.

33:41.146 --> 33:42.188
 You don't know me.

33:42.313 --> 33:43.898
You don't know
anything about me.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.567
 I know that you're suffering.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.653
All that darkness
that surrounds you.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.655
That's within you.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.407
It's breaking it down.

33:52.532 --> 33:56.745
And the sad part is, I think
you're a man who chose to build

33:56.870 --> 33:59.414
his life around that darkness.

33:59.539 --> 34:03.835
Maybe because you feel that
you don't deserve light.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.962
You do, Tim.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.422
It's time to let
your shadows go.

34:15.513 --> 34:16.723
 It's just a
little bit of snow.

34:16.848 --> 34:17.681
It'll blow through.

34:17.806 --> 34:18.516
[chuckles]

34:18.641 --> 34:20.643
LISA: Val?

34:20.768 --> 34:22.645
I don't think there's a very
delicate way to say this,

34:22.771 --> 34:28.150
but I have to tell you Dan
is using you for your money.

34:28.275 --> 34:31.612
 [laughs] Oh, Lisa!

34:31.737 --> 34:34.491
I wasn't born
yesterday, you know!

34:34.616 --> 34:36.909
Of course, Dan's
using me for my money.

34:37.034 --> 34:40.789
He's already pitchman me on
his ridiculous business scheme.

34:40.914 --> 34:43.375
I would never give him a cent.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.420
 Why in the world are you
spending time with him?

34:47.545 --> 34:50.465
 Because I'm having fun.

34:50.590 --> 34:53.426
I have precious little of
that in my life these days.

34:53.551 --> 34:58.056
And if we're both having
a good time, who cares?

34:58.181 --> 35:00.684
And speaking of fun--

35:00.809 --> 35:04.104
I don't think Jack is
having much of that today.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.816
Maybe you should spend less
time worrying about my love life

35:07.941 --> 35:10.151
and focus a little bit
more on your own, huh?

35:44.269 --> 35:46.813
 You're right.

35:46.938 --> 35:47.772
I'm a coward.

35:50.483 --> 35:52.277
 [sighs] Tim, I--

35:52.402 --> 35:53.445
 Let me finish.

35:58.199 --> 36:04.789
My wife, Marion, I never
talked with you about her

36:04.914 --> 36:05.707
because I didn't know-how.

36:08.376 --> 36:15.008
One of my biggest regrets is
not being honest with Marion

36:15.133 --> 36:17.302
about what I was going
through when we were together.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.307
It was during my rodeo days.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.686
And I was--

36:26.811 --> 36:32.859
I was busted up,
in constant pain,

36:32.984 --> 36:38.239
and drowning in a sea of
alcohol and pain pills.

36:44.579 --> 36:49.250
And Marion did her
best to try to help me,

36:49.376 --> 36:52.671
but I wouldn't let her in.

36:52.796 --> 37:01.137
So she left me to save
herself and our young girls.

37:01.262 --> 37:05.600
And I need you to
do the same thing.

37:05.725 --> 37:07.268
 Are you telling me
you're drinking again?

37:10.563 --> 37:12.524
Well, then what is it?

37:12.649 --> 37:16.611
 [sighs] The doctors
did an MRI and they found

37:16.736 --> 37:21.408
a shadow in my brain
in a place where

37:21.533 --> 37:24.911
there shouldn't be a shadow.

37:25.036 --> 37:28.581
It could be nothing
or it could kill me.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.712
It's just, wait and see.

37:37.716 --> 37:40.844
You lost your husband
and your brother.

37:40.969 --> 37:42.554
You don't need me
to make it three.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.517
So I'm giving you a way out.

37:47.642 --> 37:48.768
And I need you to take it.

37:55.108 --> 37:56.109
 Tim--

37:56.234 --> 37:57.527
 We're not married.

37:57.652 --> 37:59.946
We don't have any promises.

38:00.071 --> 38:02.782
No vows of in sickness
and in health.

38:06.453 --> 38:09.622
You need to get away from this.

38:09.748 --> 38:11.499
Because you don't deserve
to go through it again.

38:16.254 --> 38:18.006
 [sighs]

38:25.638 --> 38:27.349
I'm not going anywhere.

38:33.146 --> 38:35.023
[music playing]

38:35.148 --> 38:36.107
 I'm so sorry.

38:36.232 --> 38:37.108
I'm sorry.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.693
You're not having any fun.

38:38.818 --> 38:40.403
 I'm having fun.

38:40.528 --> 38:42.155
 You don't have to
pretend and say that.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.325
I mean, you-- you
made such a huge

38:45.450 --> 38:49.996
effort today to dress like that
for me and come out here and--

38:50.121 --> 38:52.332
[sighs] can you forgive me?

38:52.457 --> 38:54.000
 There's nothing to forgive.

38:54.125 --> 38:56.419
 I have been obsessed
with those two,

38:56.544 --> 38:58.171
Val and Dan, all
day long instead

38:58.296 --> 38:59.297
of just being here with you.

38:59.422 --> 39:02.634
And I'm sorry.

39:02.759 --> 39:04.761
 OK, well, what do you
say we make the best of it

39:04.886 --> 39:07.013
and try something
a little crazy?

39:07.138 --> 39:09.683
 OK, like, what do
you have in mind?

39:09.808 --> 39:11.142
 See that jump right there?

39:11.267 --> 39:12.268
 Yes.

39:12.394 --> 39:14.187
 Well, we ain't
going around it.

39:14.312 --> 39:17.857
 [giggles] Bartlett, you are
so full of surprises today.

39:17.982 --> 39:18.858
 [chuckles]

39:18.983 --> 39:20.235
 All right.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.403
 Hiya!

39:25.198 --> 39:26.074
 Whoo!

39:26.199 --> 39:28.576
 Whoo!

39:28.702 --> 39:30.328
AMY: No, that-- that's--

39:30.453 --> 39:31.621
yeah!

39:31.746 --> 39:33.373
Come by the ranch
anytime tomorrow.

39:33.498 --> 39:34.332
OK, thanks.

39:34.457 --> 39:35.875
Bye.

39:36.001 --> 39:36.918
That's perfect.

39:37.043 --> 39:38.044
 What happened?

39:38.169 --> 39:39.462
 I just found a
new home for Oliver.

39:39.587 --> 39:41.006
 No way!
That was fast.

39:41.131 --> 39:42.048
- I know!
- Who is it?

39:42.173 --> 39:43.466
 A friend of Val's.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.010
Apparently, she wants
to get into eventing.

39:45.135 --> 39:47.429
And Val couldn't say enough
good things about Oliver.

39:47.554 --> 39:49.222
[chuckles]

39:49.347 --> 39:51.599
 Not only did Jack on a fox
hunt, but Val did a good deed.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.977
 Yeah, it's been a strange day.

39:54.102 --> 39:55.603
How's Jasper doing?

39:55.729 --> 39:57.105
 Ah, he's feeling better.

39:57.230 --> 39:58.606
I'm just not looking
forward to telling

39:58.732 --> 39:59.858
Caleb and Cass what happened.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.651
 Well, hey, look
on the bright side.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.987
They're never going to
ask us to dog sit again.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.202

40:11.327 --> 40:12.287
 Did you say, Dada?

40:12.412 --> 40:13.246
 Yes!

40:13.371 --> 40:14.372
 Did you say, Dada?

40:14.497 --> 40:15.957
 But now you have to say, Mama!

40:20.086 --> 40:22.464
 Hey.

40:22.589 --> 40:25.550
I come in peace.

40:25.675 --> 40:28.803
Look, um, I know
that I'm pretty much

40:28.928 --> 40:30.889
the last person in the world
that you want to see right now.

40:31.014 --> 40:33.683
But before you judge
and execute me,

40:33.808 --> 40:36.311
I would like you,
uh, to plead my case.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.605
[music playing]

40:38.730 --> 40:43.151
So, OK, my very much in
the past ex-girlfriend was

40:43.276 --> 40:45.278
and still is very much an ex.

40:45.403 --> 40:47.655
I-- I just-- I should
have had that conversation

40:47.781 --> 40:50.241
with her before I kissed you.

40:50.367 --> 40:54.287
That was-- was a mistake.

40:54.412 --> 41:00.085
My friendship with you is
the most awesomely good thing

41:00.210 --> 41:02.629
that I have ever had.

41:02.754 --> 41:05.757
And I would do anything
to get that back

41:05.882 --> 41:09.302
including begging
for your forgiveness

41:09.427 --> 41:12.806
on my hands and knees.

41:12.931 --> 41:15.100
Please, forgive me, Georgie?

41:21.398 --> 41:25.360
 [sighs] OK, you're forgiven.

41:25.485 --> 41:26.861
Come on.

41:26.986 --> 41:29.280
[laughing]

41:29.406 --> 41:30.740
But just to be clear, I'm--

41:30.865 --> 41:33.368
I'm only offering you my
friendship, nothing else.

41:33.493 --> 41:34.661
 I'll take it.

41:34.786 --> 41:35.787
 And you need to lay off Dylan.

41:35.912 --> 41:36.705
You were wrong about him.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.457
He wasn't after Flame.

41:39.582 --> 41:40.458
 OK, yeah, yeah!

41:40.583 --> 41:42.085
I'll do whatever.

41:42.210 --> 41:45.046
As long as it means we can
go back to being friends.

41:45.171 --> 41:45.964
 Awesome.

41:46.089 --> 41:47.007
Come on, let's go to Maggie's.

41:47.132 --> 41:48.967

42:11.698 --> 42:14.534
(SINGING) It was
not my bed to make.

42:17.746 --> 42:21.541
But it might have
been my soul to take.

42:24.586 --> 42:27.756
And I paid dearly
for my mistakes.

But it was my--

42:31.718 --> 42:33.720
my bed to make.

42:38.600 --> 42:49.277
It was not in my words or
