WEBVTT

00:08.042 --> 00:08.709
HEY, AUNT RACHEL.

00:08.776 --> 00:09.877
HI.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.046
WE'RE GOING TO THE MALL.
WANNA COME?

00:12.113 --> 00:14.248
I'M NOT EXACTLY
DRESSED FOR IT.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.085
I THINK I'LL TAKE
A SHOWER INSTEAD. HAVE FUN.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.189
HI, EVERYBODY.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.226
URKEL, DON'T YOU EVER KNOCK?

00:25.293 --> 00:29.563
NO. I DON'T LIKE TO
DISTURB ANYONE.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.633
IF YOU GUYS ARE GOING OUT,
MIND IF I TAG ALONG?

00:32.700 --> 00:36.304
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
WE'RE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.738
HIDE AND SEEK.
THAT'S IT.

00:37.805 --> 00:42.310
OH, GREAT. MY PARENTS PLAY THIS
WITH ME ALL THE TIME.

00:43.744 --> 00:47.748
ONCE I FOUND THEM IN MILWAUKEE
LIVING UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.221
OKAY, YOU'RE IT. GO IN
THE CLOSET AND COUNT TO 25

00:53.287 --> 00:56.490
GEE, THANKS, LAURA.
THIS IS GONNA BE LOADS OF FUN.

01:00.328 --> 01:04.132
AND, LAURA.
I'M COMING AFTER YOU FIRST.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.569
LET'S GO.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.544
READY OR NOT.
HERE I COME.

01:19.447 --> 01:23.451
THAT SHOWER RUNNING
DOESN'T FOOL ME, LAURA.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.426
AHH!

01:34.828 --> 01:36.430
SORRY, RACHEL.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.868
WOW!

01:52.580 --> 01:54.782
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:54.848 --> 01:56.284
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:56.350 --> 01:59.587
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:59.653 --> 02:03.224
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

02:03.291 --> 02:07.695
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

02:07.761 --> 02:11.031
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

02:11.098 --> 02:13.434
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

02:15.035 --> 02:18.606
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

02:18.672 --> 02:21.809
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

02:23.477 --> 02:26.614
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:26.680 --> 02:30.451
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

02:30.518 --> 02:33.487
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

02:33.554 --> 02:37.225
* BUT WE'LL SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

02:37.291 --> 02:40.661
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:40.728 --> 02:44.198
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

02:44.265 --> 02:48.269
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AND OPPORTUNITY *

02:48.336 --> 02:51.539
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:51.605 --> 02:55.276
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

03:21.101 --> 03:23.203
GOOD DINNER.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.806
THANKS. WHO'LL HELP
WITH THE DISHES?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.107
I GOT HOMEWORK.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.242
ME, TOO.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.111
RODNEY'S GOT
A NEW VIDEO GAME.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.145
FREEZE!

03:32.212 --> 03:34.081
NOBODY MOVE.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.885
IT'S TOUGH HAVING
A COP FOR A FATHER.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.653
DINNER ISN'T OVER YET.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.088
I MADE DESSERT.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.391
OH.
OH.
OH. OH.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.596
WELL, THIS IS MY SPECIAL
LEMON CREME TARTS.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.197
WHERE DID YOU
BUY THEM?

03:50.264 --> 03:53.734
THAT LITTLE BAKERY THAT NAMED
A DOUGHNUT AFTER YOU?

03:55.269 --> 03:56.937
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
RACHEL,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.839
I HAPPEN TO BE
A GREAT COOK.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.641
HUH HUH HUH.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.778
CARL,
YOU DON'T COOK.
YOU BURN.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.316
YOU BURN EGGS.
YOU BURN TOAST.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.851
YOU'RE THE ONLY
MAN I KNOW WHO
BURNS Jell-O.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.423
WELL, I'LL PRETEND
I WASN'T INSULTED BY THAT.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.125
I KNOW ONCE YOU'VE TASTED
ONE OF THESE BABIES

04:18.191 --> 04:21.495
YOU-ALL WILL BE
HEAPING ME WITH PRAISE.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.264
I EVEN MADE A SPECIAL ONE
FOR LITTLE RICHIE--

04:24.332 --> 04:26.634
A LEMON CREAM TARTETTE.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.271
THEY LOOK
PRETTY GOOD.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.906
JUDY, DAD MADE THEM.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.343
HOW GOOD CAN THEY BE?

04:37.778 --> 04:41.649
OF COURSE, I KNOW
I'LL LOVE THEM.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.121
HEY, THIS IS GOOD.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.558
SEE?
EDWARD LIKES THEM.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.725
WHAT DOES THAT
PROVE?

04:51.792 --> 04:54.462
EDDIE EATS PASTE.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.598
OH, NO. THIS IS
A LOT BETTER THAN PASTE.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.834
MMM! CARL,
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.737
MMM! OH,
THIS IS BETTER
THAN DELICIOUS.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.206
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

05:06.273 --> 05:07.708
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO COOK LIKE THIS?

05:07.775 --> 05:09.610
IT'S MY FATHER'S
SECRET RECIPE.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.946
WINSLOW MEN HAVE PASSED IT
DOWN FOR GENERATIONS.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.247
YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.618
WELL, THAT'S WHY
IT'S A SECRET RECIPE.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.120
IF I HAD KNOWN
YOU COOKED LIKE THIS,

05:20.187 --> 05:22.823
I WOULD HAVE
QUIT COOKING.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.593
NOW IT'S TIME TO PASS ON
THE SECRET

05:25.659 --> 05:27.995
OF THE WINSLOW TART
TO EDWARD.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.964
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES.

05:31.031 --> 05:35.369
IT'S TIME TO TALK ABOUT
THE FLOUR AND THE FILLING.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.004
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO DRAW
STICK FIGURES AGAIN,

05:37.070 --> 05:38.639
ARE YOU?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.811
COULD YOU WHIP UP
A BATCH OF THESE

05:43.877 --> 05:45.946
FOR MY WRITERS'
WORKSHOP MEETING?

05:46.013 --> 05:49.216
WE USUALLY ONLY SERVE
THESE TO FAMILY MEMBERS,

05:49.282 --> 05:50.651
BUT, HEY,
IT'S THE NINETIES.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.019
THE BERLIN WALL IS DOWN.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.221
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.523
GREAT!

05:55.589 --> 05:59.359
NOW THAT WE'VE ALL
ENJOYED THE WINSLOW TART,

05:59.427 --> 06:01.161
WHO'S GOING TO HELP
WITH THE WINSLOW DISHES?

06:01.228 --> 06:02.195
HOMEWORK.
HOMEWORK.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.398
RODNEY'S.
DIAPERS.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.505
SEE, CARL,
IF YOU COOKED MORE,
YOU'D KNOW.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.706
NEVER SERVE THEM DESSERT

06:12.773 --> 06:15.576
UNTIL AFTER THE DISHES
ARE DONE.

06:20.113 --> 06:20.981
HI.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.315
HEY, DAD.
HI, HONEY.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.417
HOW WAS
YOUR DAY?

06:23.484 --> 06:26.420
IT WAS A NORMAL DAY.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.721
WE TOOK A BITE
OUT OF CRIME,

06:27.788 --> 06:32.560
AND THE LAWYERS SPIT IT
BACK ON THE STREETS.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.728
ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY.
LISTEN UP.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.030
YOU KNOW THE BATCH
OF TARTS YOU MADE

06:37.097 --> 06:38.566
FOR MY WRITERS' WORKSHOP?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.167
WELL, ONE OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE GROUP

06:40.233 --> 06:43.937
IS THE MANAGER
OF ROBERTO'S CAFE.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.840
HE MANAGES A RESTAURANT,
AND HE WANTS TO WRITE?

06:46.907 --> 06:49.076
WELL, WHAT HE REALLY WANTS
TO DO IS DIRECT,

06:49.142 --> 06:52.112
BUT THE POINT IS,
HE ATE ONE OF YOUR TARTS,

06:52.179 --> 06:53.681
AND HE LOVED IT.

06:53.747 --> 06:59.052
THE RESTAURANT
WANTS TO BUY YOUR TARTS.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.988
THE RESTAURANT
WANTS TO BUY MY TARTS?

07:01.054 --> 07:04.892
YES! WE CAN BAKE SOME
BATCHES IN THE HOUSE.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.460
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.162
YOU AND CARL IN
MY KITCHEN COOKING?

07:09.229 --> 07:11.398
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.800
OH, HARRIETTE, RELAX.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.568
WE WON'T MESS UP
THE KITCHEN.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.671
IT'S JUST A WAY
TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY.

07:17.738 --> 07:21.008
I LIKE THIS.
FAMILY-OWNED
BUSINESS.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.342
LOW OVERHEAD.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.545
QUICK RETURNS.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.948
A READY SUPPLY
OF UNSKILLED LABOR.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.084
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE'S RIGHT, CARL.

07:31.151 --> 07:35.088
ALL WE NEED IS A SNAPPY NAME
FOR THE PRODUCT.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.990
HOW ABOUT THIS?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.593
CARL'S COP CAKES.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.329
I LIKE THAT.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.697
I LIKE THAT.

07:43.764 --> 07:47.000
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL PUT MY PICTURE
ON THE MENU?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.903
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKES.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.139
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.441
A PICTURE'S A GREAT IDEA.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.344
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE
A FAMILY CORPORATION.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.579
EVERYONE CONTRIBUTES.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.413
EVERYONE GETS
AN EQUAL SHARE.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.215
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.151
I DON'T WANT TO
SEEM PETTY,

08:04.217 --> 08:05.719
BUT IT IS MY RECIPE.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.220
YOU GET TWO SHARES.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.623
WAIT. I MADE THE SALE.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.925
YOU GET
TWO SHARES, TOO.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.193
AND GRANDMA?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.227
SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.898
OUT OF TOWN,
OUT OF LUCK.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.301
LAURA, SHE'S
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.202
ALRIGHT.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.370
ENOUGH TALK ABOUT SHARES.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.505
LET'S TALK
ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS.

08:25.573 --> 08:29.042
SHOULD I WEAR A CHEF'S HAT
IN MY PICTURE?

08:29.109 --> 08:29.977
OOH! A CHEF'S HAT!

08:30.043 --> 08:32.546
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

08:39.753 --> 08:41.388
IS RACHEL BACK
FROM THE RESTAURANT?

08:41.454 --> 08:42.556
NOT YET.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.457
I TOLD HER TO FLIRT
WITH THE MANAGER.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.960
MAYBE
HE'LL ORDER MORE.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.431
HI, EVERYONE.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.465
HOW DID IT GO?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.500
OH, IT WENT GREAT.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.068
THE RESTAURANT
LOVED THEM.

08:55.135 --> 08:55.869
NOT ONLY THAT,

08:55.936 --> 08:57.337
BUT THE RESTAURANT
IS OWNED

08:57.404 --> 09:00.774
BY ONE OF THOSE
BIG CORPORATIONS,
AMALGAMATED FOODS.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.542
THEY LOVED THEM, TOO.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.312
THIS IS GOING
TO BE BIG.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.281
DID YOU SHOW THEM
MY PICTURE?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.283
YES, AND THEY LOVED
EVERYTHING.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.418
LET'S CELEBRATE.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.853
WHOA.
RACHEL, HOLD IT.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.756
YOU'RE
SELLING TOO HARD.
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

09:15.823 --> 09:17.324
IS THERE
BAD NEWS?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.526
NO, IT'S NOT
REALLY BAD NEWS.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.194
THE REGIONAL MANAGER
PLACED AN ORDER

09:21.261 --> 09:23.764
FOR THE RESTAURANTS
IN THE TRI-STATE AREA.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.867
THEY WANT A THOUSAND.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.303
IS THAT BAD NEWS?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.372
NO, IT'S NOT
BAD NEWS.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.142
A THOUSAND TARTS
IS A LOT OF TARTS.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.779
IF THEY'RE NOT
NEEDED BY MONDAY,
WE CAN DO IT.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.513
WHEN ARE THEY NEEDED?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.049
MONDAY.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.719
OH, SO THAT'S
THE BAD NEWS.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.988
NO. NOT TO ME.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.123
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO
HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER,

09:50.190 --> 09:51.591
BUT WE CAN DO IT.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.627
I LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.829
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW
I FELT WHEN I AGREED

09:55.896 --> 09:57.698
TO BAKE 1,000 TARTS.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.934
THEN I FOUND OUT
THEY MEANT 1,000 DOZEN.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.404
A THOU--
12,000 TARTS BY MONDAY?

10:04.471 --> 10:05.372
THIS MONDAY?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.741
DAY AFTER TOMORROW
MONDAY?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.712
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

10:21.889 --> 10:25.893
12,000 TARTS
IN TWO DAYS.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.128
IT'S NOT AS MANY
AS IT SOUNDS.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.864
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SOUNDS
LIKE A LOT.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.667
I DO KNOW,
AND IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.737
SOMETIMES YOU ARE
SO NEGATIVE.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.906
YOU ALWAYS
SEE THE GLASS
AS HALF-EMPTY.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.208
I SEE IT
AS HALF-FULL.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.343
OH, IT'S FULL
ALRIGHT.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.779
IT HAS 12,000
TARTS IN IT.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.784
DO YOU THINK
WE CAN BAKE 12,000
IN TWO DAYS?

10:50.851 --> 10:52.319
OF COURSE, WE CAN.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.088
CARL, WHERE THERE'S A WILL,
THERE'S A WAY.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.457
WE'VE GOT TO DREAM
THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.794
WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH,
THE TOUGH GET GOING.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.731
I HATE TO INTERRUPT
YOUR CLICHES,

11:03.797 --> 11:04.865
BUT YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TELL

11:04.932 --> 11:07.801
AMALGAMATED FOODS
YOU CAN'T DO IT.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.402
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.704
THEY GAVE ME AN ADVANCE.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.239
GIVE THE MONEY
BACK.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.573
I CAN'T.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.676
COMING HOME I STOPPED OFF
FOR SOME ODDS AND ENDS.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.577
[DOORBELL RINGS]

11:17.644 --> 11:18.779
I'LL--I'LL GET THAT.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.349
WHY DON'T ALL OF YOU GO
CHECK ON RICHIE?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.361
HI, RACHEL.
I GOT YOUR ORDER.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.398
THANKS, PHIL.
THAT GOES IN THE KITCHEN.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.068
HOW YOU FOLKS DOING?

11:42.770 --> 11:44.938
A FEW ODDS AND ENDS,
HUH, RACHEL?

11:45.005 --> 11:47.841
JUST THE BARE NECESSITIES.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.309
OH, HI, GUS.
HOW YOU DOING?

11:49.376 --> 11:52.345
THAT GOES IN THE KITCHEN.
FOLLOW PHIL. THANKS.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.719
RACHEL, WHAT'S THAT?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.221
IT'S A BARTLETT 111.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.157
THAT BABY CAN MIX
300 GALLONS
OF BATTER AN HOUR.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.526
LET ME SHOW YOU.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.595
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.698
RACHEL, HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND?

12:11.765 --> 12:14.034
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.369
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TAKE RISKS.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.805
YOU THINK
FAMOUS AMOS
WAS FAMOUS

12:17.871 --> 12:20.808
BEFORE HE TOOK
RISKS? NO.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.475
AND BEFORE
SHE STARTED BAKING,

12:22.542 --> 12:25.545
WHO WAS MRS. FIELDS?

12:25.612 --> 12:27.514
MISS FIELDS?

12:29.649 --> 12:31.318
SHE WAS AN EVERYDAY
HOUSEWIFE

12:31.384 --> 12:33.620
WITH A FEW
CHOCOLATE CHIPS
AND A DREAM.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.488
WE'VE GOT
A DREAM, TOO.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.723
WE'RE NOT
GOING TO REST

12:36.790 --> 12:39.526
UNTIL WE MAKE CARL
THE PRINCE OF TARTS.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.961
WE'RE WITH YOU.
AMEN!

12:41.028 --> 12:42.362
WHOA.
HOLD THE SERMON.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.632
AM I NOT GOOD
ENOUGH TO BE
THE KING OF TARTS?

12:45.698 --> 12:48.068
OH, YOU KNOW YOU CAN.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.603
LOOK, LOOK,
LOOK, LOOK.

12:50.670 --> 12:51.972
I KNOW YOU
ALWAYS THINK

12:52.039 --> 12:54.707
I SAY STOP
WHEN YOU WANT TO GO,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.009
BUT I'VE DONE
LOTS OF BAKING.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.511
WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO
IS IMPOSSIBLE.

12:58.578 --> 13:03.783
I'M BEGGING.
STOP AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.289
ALRIGHT.
IS EVERYBODY WITH ME?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.958
YEAH!
YEAH!

13:11.024 --> 13:12.960
WE NEED FLOUR, SUGAR,
BIG SPOONS.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.362
WE NEED ALL
OF THAT.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.964
NOW I KNOW HOW
THE PASTRY CHEF FELT

13:17.030 --> 13:18.832
ON THE TITANIC.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.872
* SHE WORKS HARD
FOR THE MONEY *

13:24.938 --> 13:27.007
* SO HARD FOR IT, HONEY *

13:27.074 --> 13:28.675
WHIP IT UP
IN THERE, BABY.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.911
* WE WORK HARD
FOR THE MONEY *

13:30.978 --> 13:33.513
* SO YOU BETTER
TREAT US RIGHT *

13:33.580 --> 13:34.681
WHOA!

13:34.747 --> 13:36.249
YES!

13:36.316 --> 13:40.153
NOW, SEE. ISN'T THIS GREAT. NOT
ONLY ARE WE MAKING EXTRA MONEY

13:40.220 --> 13:42.956
BUT WE ARE MAKING A MEMORY.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.960
HEY, MOM.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.596
MRS. CORDINI SAYS WE CAN USE
HER OVEN ALL NIGHT,

13:49.662 --> 13:51.999
IF WE STOP SINGING.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.767
THAT WOMAN NEVER
DID HAVE ANY CLASS.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.971
LOOK AT MR. CORDINI.

14:01.741 --> 14:05.678
HI, LAURA.
YOU BUSY?

14:05.745 --> 14:09.682
FORGET IT, STEVE.
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO BE MEAN.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.285
GREAT. MAYBE
I'LL STAY AWHILE.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.087
CAN I HELP?

14:14.154 --> 14:14.988
YEAH.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.990
YOU GOT AN OVEN
WE CAN USE CHEAP?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.859
SURE. YOU CAN USE
MINE FOR FREE.

14:19.927 --> 14:23.196
ALL I ASK
IS FOR LAURA'S HAND
IN MARRIAGE.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.102
EXACTLY HOW BIG
IS YOUR OVEN?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.005
DAD!

14:32.539 --> 14:34.374
SAY...

14:35.208 --> 14:37.945
IS THAT
A BARTLETT 111?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.913
WELL, YES, IT IS.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.248
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.016
THEY HAVE ONE
JUST LIKE THIS

14:43.083 --> 14:45.385
AT THE DOUGHNUT SHOP
DOWNTOWN.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.055
YOU KNOW, A MOUSE
FELL IN THERE ONCE

14:48.121 --> 14:51.824
WHEN THEY
WERE MAKING
JELLY DOUGHNUTS.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.961
WELL, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.295
NOT REALLY.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.398
THEY DIDN'T GET
ONE COMPLAINT.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.802
EXACTLY WHICH
DOUGHNUT SHOP WAS THIS?

15:02.869 --> 15:05.973
THE ONE NEXT TO
THE POLICE STATION.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.942
YOU EVER
EAT THERE, CARL?

15:10.510 --> 15:11.911
GET HIM OUT.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.680
GET HIM OUT!

15:13.746 --> 15:15.648
NO NEED TO SEE ME
TO THE DOOR.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.185
I'LL SHOW
MYSELF OUT.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.632
COME ON, JUDY.
KEEP UP.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.867
I HAVE A STOMACH ACHE.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.004
YOU EAT MORE
THAN YOU MAKE.

15:37.070 --> 15:40.440
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
A TART UP YOUR NOSE?

15:41.975 --> 15:43.843
COME ON, SWEETHEART.

15:43.910 --> 15:47.080
IT'S WAY PAST
YOUR BEDTIME.

15:47.981 --> 15:48.948
MOM?

15:49.016 --> 15:51.084
I HATE TARTS.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.286
WE ALL DO, HONEY.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.057
RACHEL, I'M GOING
TO GET YOU FOR THIS.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.094
WHAT A GROUCH.

16:01.161 --> 16:04.998
WE OUGHT TO TAKE AWAY
ONE OF HER SHARES.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.067
COME ON.
WE'RE SLOWING DOWN.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.869
WELL, RACHEL, I'M MIXING
AS FAST AS I CAN.

16:09.936 --> 16:13.373
HOW MANY MORE OF THESE
STINKING TARTS DO WE NEED?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.175
9,432.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.679
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
MAKE IT BY MONDAY.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.416
DAD, WHEN ARE WE GOING
TO TAKE A BREAK?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.484
I DON'T KNOW.

16:24.551 --> 16:28.221
ASK YOUR
AUNT RACHEL.
SHE'S THE HEAD TART.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.093
COME ON, WE'VE GOT
TARTS TO MAKE.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.762
RACHEL, YOU'RE
PUTTING TOO MUCH
FILLING IN THOSE.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.231
I'M WHAT?

16:40.400 --> 16:43.903
YOU SHOT
YOUR BAG AT ME.

16:43.970 --> 16:44.671
SORRY.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.538
ON PURPOSE.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.639
I DID NOT.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.908
DID NOT.
DID, TOO.
DID, TOO.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.243
LOOK,
WE'RE TIRED ENOUGH.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.080
LET'S NOT WASTE
OUR ENERGY FIGHTING.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.382
YOU'RE RIGHT,
RACHEL. LET'S
GET BACK TO WORK.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.884
DARN.

16:57.950 --> 16:58.818
WHAT'S WRONG NOW?

16:58.885 --> 17:02.089
MY BAG IS--UH!
CLOGGED.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.035
OKAY.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.940
NO MORE MR. NICE GUY.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.575
OH! COME ON, CARL.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.411
DON'T DO SOMETHING
YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.812
I'M NOT GOING TO
REGRET THIS.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.014
I'M GOING TO
LOVE IT.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.682
ALRIGHT, STAND BACK!

17:29.749 --> 17:30.483
I'VE GOT FLOUR HERE,

17:30.550 --> 17:33.586
AND I'M NOT AFRAID
TO USE IT.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.222
THIS IS SILLY.

17:36.022 --> 17:36.689
TRUCE?

17:36.756 --> 17:39.359
TRUCE.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.294
SUCKER!

17:41.361 --> 17:42.895
OOH!

17:42.962 --> 17:46.133
SAY YOUR PRAYERS,
WINSLOW.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.372
OH!

17:54.541 --> 17:56.676
FOOD FIGHT!

17:56.743 --> 17:58.411
HEY, DAD?

17:59.146 --> 18:01.448
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.037
EXCUSE ME!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.207
EXCUSE ME!

18:27.274 --> 18:28.908
I SAW YOUR LIGHTS
WERE ON.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.412
GOT ANYTHING TO EAT?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.492
AAH! AAH!

18:49.962 --> 18:51.598
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY!

18:51.664 --> 18:54.133
HEY, HEY!

18:54.201 --> 18:56.002
LOOK AT YOU PEOPLE.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.470
LOOK AT MY KITCHEN.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.072
HAVE YOU
LOST YOUR MINDS?

19:00.139 --> 19:00.807
HE STARTED IT.

19:00.873 --> 19:01.541
I DID NOT.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.676
WASN'T ME.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.213
I WAS JUST MINDING
MY OWN BUSINESS.

19:08.548 --> 19:12.319
I JUST CAME OVER
FOR A SNACK.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.555
I DON'T CARE
WHO STARTED IT. IT'S OVER!

19:15.622 --> 19:18.024
I WON'T SAY HOW YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE CHILDREN,

19:18.090 --> 19:19.959
HOW YOU DESTROYED
MY KITCHEN,

19:20.026 --> 19:22.595
OR THIS WAS
A DUMB IDEA.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.198
I WON'T SAY THAT.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.371
I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY SHE STARTED IT.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.673
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
I HAD LOUSY HELP.

19:33.740 --> 19:37.344
GOOD. I'M GLAD
WE'RE ALL AGREED.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.411
SHE STARTED IT.
YOU DID.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.846
DID NOT.
DID NOT.
DID.
DID.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.180
STOP!

19:46.085 --> 19:49.322
CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF MILK
TO GO WITH MY FACE?

20:05.272 --> 20:08.441
HMM. NO.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.577
NO, I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE KING OF TARTS.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.713
NO. GET THE MOUSE!
GET THE MOUSE!

20:15.848 --> 20:19.319
TARTS INCOMING.
HIT THE DECK! HIT THE--

20:19.386 --> 20:21.187
DADDY.
YOU'RE DREAMING.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.822
OH.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.224
OH.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.727
WHAT TIME IS IT?

20:27.794 --> 20:28.761
8:00.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.229
DID YOU GUYS FINISH?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.631
TWO HOURS AGO.

20:31.698 --> 20:35.635
YOUR AUNT RACHEL
TOOK THE TARTS
TO THE RESTAURANT.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.942
OY VAY!

20:44.043 --> 20:45.778
DID WE GET A CHECK?

20:45.845 --> 20:49.582
YEAH. IT'S RIGHT HERE.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.120
WOW! WE'RE RICH.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.755
WHOA!

20:55.822 --> 20:58.991
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.793
WELL,

21:00.860 --> 21:03.863
WE STILL HAVE TO DEDUCT
A FEW EXPENSES.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.164
LIKE WHAT?

21:05.231 --> 21:08.968
LIKE FLOUR AND EGGS
AND BAKERY RACKS,
POTS AND PANS,

21:09.035 --> 21:10.570
AND THE BARTLETT 111,

21:10.637 --> 21:13.906
AND THE RENTAL TRAILER
TO HAUL THE TARTS
TO THE RESTAURANT.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.509
RACHEL,

21:16.576 --> 21:18.077
WHAT'S
THE BOTTOM LINE?

21:18.144 --> 21:22.615
HOW MUCH PROFIT
ARE WE TALKING?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.684
$24.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.620
WE WORKED STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE WEEKEND

21:27.687 --> 21:30.923
FOR A MEASLY
$24 A PIECE?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.225
NO.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.363
$24 TOTAL.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.565
THAT'S $4.00 APIECE.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.867
I KNEW THIS
WOULDN'T WORK.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.035
EXCUSE ME,
"MS. BLACK
ENTERPRISE."

21:43.102 --> 21:44.070
WEREN'T YOU
GOING TO TAKE

21:44.136 --> 21:45.672
THIS CORPORATION
PUBLIC?

21:45.738 --> 21:48.841
I PUT THE THOUGHT
IN HER HEAD.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.943
ME AND MY DUMB IDEAS.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.079
IT WASN'T
A DUMB IDEA.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.748
IT JUST WASN'T
THOUGHT OUT.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.116
I THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE WONDERFUL

21:57.183 --> 22:00.252
TO START
OUR OWN BUSINESS.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.655
NO. IT WAS
ALL MY FAULT.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.725
I SHOULD'VE KEPT
MY SECRET RECIPE A SECRET.

22:05.792 --> 22:09.496
NO, NO, NO.
I PUSHED YOU INTO IT.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.964
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.900
NOW I HAD MY NAME ON IT.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.202
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.670
IT WAS MY FAULT.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.873
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO. IT WAS
EVERYBODY'S FAULT,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.775
EXCEPT MINE.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.714
WE DID ACTUALLY
BAKE 12,000 TARTS,

22:27.780 --> 22:28.715
NOT COUNTING
THE ONES WE THREW.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.550
THAT WAS
PRETTY AMAZING.

22:30.617 --> 22:34.387
YEAH. I LIKED
THE FOOD FIGHT.

22:34.454 --> 22:37.690
THIS WEEKEND
THE WINSLOWS PROVED

22:37.757 --> 22:39.225
THAT THEY CAN
DO ANYTHING

22:39.291 --> 22:40.627
WHEN THEY PUT
THEIR MINDS TO IT.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.463
ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?
WE'RE AMAZING.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.231
NOW WE GOT TO SET
OUR MIND

22:45.297 --> 22:47.099
TO CLEANING UP
THIS KITCHEN.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.801
LET'S GO GET IT.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.503
OH, BOY.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.504
WELL, BABY,

22:51.571 --> 22:52.939
WE'LL TRY IT AGAIN
NEXT TIME.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.041
YEAH.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.242
THERE'S ALWAYS THAT.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.078
THAT'D BE
THE THING TO DO.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.614
OOH.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.315
ALRIGHT,
LET'S GET CRACKING.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.717
HOMEWORK.
HOMEWORK.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.554
RODNEY'S.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.423
WHY DON'T
WE TAKE THE $24

23:10.490 --> 23:12.324
AND PAY SOMEBODY
TO CLEAN THIS UP?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.060
NOW, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.495
MM-HMM. YEAH.
