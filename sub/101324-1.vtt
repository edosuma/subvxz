What's wrong?

03:15.220 --> 03:16.513
Is everything okay?

03:16.597 --> 03:18.098
- He hasn't turned up.
- What?

03:18.181 --> 03:20.642

Lovely.

Right. How are you feeling?

05:05.330 --> 05:08.625
I feel fine.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.670
- Fine?
- Yeah.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.173
No.

05:16.842 --> 05:18.010
Good.

05:18.510 --> 05:20.637
<i>Fine or good?</i>

05:22.347 --> 05:23.181
<i>Good.</i>

05:24.182 --> 05:25.475
<i>No depression?</i>

05:26.351 --> 05:27.853

05:27.936 --> 05:29.354
You?

Yeah.

05:56.215 --> 05:57.507
Good.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.472
Nice, isn't it?

06:05.599 --> 06:06.975
Yeah.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.437
That could be you one day.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.649
Yeah.

07:01.363 --> 07:02.698
Merry Christmas.

07:11.874 --> 07:13.625
Hello?

07:15.252 --> 07:17.045
Anyone?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.424
Anyone?

07:21.425 --> 07:23.385
Quickly! Quickly.

07:23.468 --> 07:25.846
- Jane? What are you doing here?
- That's nice.

07:25.929 --> 07:29.808
Hello, Mom, Dad. Come in.
I've got something to...

07:29.892 --> 07:34.313
Nicola, Lucy, come on. Quickly, guys.
I haven't got all day.

07:34.396 --> 07:36.315
Didn't expect you here, but it's all right.

07:37.232 --> 07:41.528
Now, I don't...
I don't wanna cause anyone any offense,

07:41.612 --> 07:43.864
but I bought my own presents this year.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.368
Yes, I have. Yeah.

07:48.452 --> 07:50.329
It's just, to be honest...

07:51.330 --> 07:55.459
you know, I've had enough of all the soap
and the socks all the time,

07:55.542 --> 07:57.169
because it is a lot, isn't it?

07:57.252 --> 07:59.588
Yeah, I know. I can see it, Mom.

07:59.671 --> 08:01.673
I recognize the shape.

08:01.757 --> 08:04.218
I like them, I've just got a lot of them.

08:04.301 --> 08:08.096
And, Nicola, you didn't even
buy me socks last year, did you?

08:10.724 --> 08:14.811
It's okay.
I hope I haven't offended anyone.

08:14.895 --> 08:15.979
No.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.316
So I've wrapped them from you,
make it easier.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.194
I just need the money now, thank you.

08:22.277 --> 08:24.947
- That's from you, Nicola, take it.
- What?

08:27.407 --> 08:30.452
- Fuck off. I'm not giving you that.
- Nicky.

08:30.536 --> 08:33.246
Well, you have to, so no choice.

08:33.328 --> 08:35.499
No, no,
I haven't got enough money for myself,

08:35.582 --> 08:38.501
let alone to buy you
some fancy fucking bag.

08:39.501 --> 08:40.754
Yes, yes.

08:49.555 --> 08:52.099
Thank you so much.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.478
The paper, brilliant too.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.732
That's so nice. Keep that.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.077
I love it! It's stunning.

09:13.245 --> 09:14.621
Thank you.

09:14.705 --> 09:16.498
Where'd you get it from?

09:22.087 --> 09:24.882
I love it. I love it so much.
Thank you so much.

09:25.883 --> 09:27.593
What's this? From you?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.443
Yes. Yes, yes, yes!

09:45.444 --> 09:48.071
Oh, Nicola!

09:48.155 --> 09:50.490
- You didn't have to.
- I didn't.

09:50.574 --> 09:52.951
- Yeah, you did, though, didn't you?
- I didn't.

09:53.035 --> 09:56.163
So 250 pounds, please.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.083
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not buying you that bag, Jane.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.461
- You already did, didn't you?
- No.

10:03.962 --> 10:06.715
We'll talk about it.
Maybe I'll get this one.

10:06.798 --> 10:08.800
Yeah, great. All right. Merry Christmas.

10:08.884 --> 10:10.302
Merry Christmas!

10:10.385 --> 10:13.430
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.743
Hi, Alice.

10:34.826 --> 10:35.994
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:36.078 --> 10:38.622
- Merry Christmas.
- Well...

10:39.998 --> 10:44.253
<i>Wish you a Merry Christmas
I'll wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

10:44.336 --> 10:48.090
<i>I'll wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

10:49.925 --> 10:52.052
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

10:52.135 --> 10:55.472
- Shall I help you?
- Yeah. Thank you.

10:55.556 --> 10:57.516
Thanks for the necklace.
I absolutely love it.

10:57.599 --> 10:58.475
What necklace?

10:58.559 --> 11:00.727
- I'll give you your receipt later.
- What receipt?

11:00.811 --> 11:02.729
- There we go.
- Thank you.

11:02.813 --> 11:06.108
Is Jack all right?
He opened all his presents, did he?

11:06.191 --> 11:08.569
Yeah. You do know
that you got him an umbrella?

11:08.652 --> 11:11.280
Yeah, that's from me. He like it, yeah?

11:11.363 --> 11:15.701
- Well, he's 9. He doesn't really need one.
- Okay. Did he like it?

11:16.702 --> 11:19.162
- Yeah, he did, actually.
- Good.

11:20.831 --> 11:23.709
- What time's dinner?
- It'll be ready when it's ready, Jane.

11:23.792 --> 11:26.211
Okay. Bit hungry.

11:26.295 --> 11:29.214
- Carrots. Carrots, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:29.298 --> 11:30.841
Roasted potatoes.

11:31.842 --> 11:34.303
- Yorkshire pudding? Carrots?
- Yeah.

11:34.386 --> 11:36.430
Turkey?

11:39.808 --> 11:42.185
What did you put on the carrots, Tony?

11:43.186 --> 11:44.813
Coriander.

11:46.315 --> 11:47.649
Okay.

11:57.326 --> 11:58.744
All right, Jack?

11:58.827 --> 12:02.581
Hey. What's up? You all right?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.293
Christmas.

12:06.376 --> 12:08.337
It's Christmas.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.838
Take it.

12:09.922 --> 12:12.132
His dog passed away this morning.

12:12.216 --> 12:15.552
- What?
- His dog passed away this morning.

12:16.553 --> 12:17.971
Yeah.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.102
- What did the dog die of?
- Cancer.

12:25.604 --> 12:30.734
Well, doctor did say it runs in the family.

12:33.779 --> 12:37.407
Well, gotta be careful. Yeah.

12:40.661 --> 12:43.747
I have to go,
because I don't like coriander.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.083
Jane, sit down, please.

13:12.150 --> 13:14.862
We're putting you
on a different dose of medication.

13:14.945 --> 13:15.863
Why?

13:16.864 --> 13:21.910
I feel fine on the medication
that I'm on, actually.

13:21.994 --> 13:24.454
We don't want to feel fine.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.332
We want to feel better. Don't we?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.961
- Do we?
- Yes.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.547
- Okay.
- Repeat after me.

13:33.630 --> 13:36.592
I'm in my oils.

13:39.469 --> 13:42.139
I'm in my oils.

13:57.779 --> 14:00.699
Did the doctor say you put on weight?

14:03.869 --> 14:06.038
- No.
- She has, hasn't she?

14:07.164 --> 14:09.708
I'm on new medication.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.586
So I'm sleeping a lot.

14:12.669 --> 14:14.963
Well, you need to wake up.

14:15.047 --> 14:16.048
Okay.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.717
What's Alice been doing?

14:19.718 --> 14:22.846
You can tell her
we've decided to move away.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.390
This is no life for us. It's disgusting.

14:25.474 --> 14:27.309
She won't even talk to her own mother.

14:28.310 --> 14:29.603
What have I done?

14:29.686 --> 14:31.813
- What have I done?
- Nothing.

14:31.897 --> 14:33.523
She's just jealous, isn't she?

14:33.607 --> 14:37.486
She is, isn't she? Is she?

14:38.654 --> 14:42.366
But we've been redecorating the kitchen.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.952
It's lovely. We're in our oils.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.205
You should start doing something
about this place.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.123
It's beginning to look like a squat.

14:55.629 --> 14:56.922
Better get that.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.392
- Hello?
- <i>Hey. I haven't heard from you in a while.</i>

15:08.475 --> 15:10.143
<i>Are you okay? You sound tired.</i>

15:10.227 --> 15:12.938
I can't talk. My parents are here.
Quick, quick.

15:13.021 --> 15:14.439
<i>Have you told them about us yet?</i>

15:14.523 --> 15:16.692
No, not yet. They're not ready. I will.

15:16.775 --> 15:19.945
- <i>Look, I just love you. I want them to know.</i>
- I love you too.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.241
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Okay, bye.

15:30.706 --> 15:32.374
What's wrong?

15:34.001 --> 15:34.877
Nothing.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.169
Well, sit down.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.964
There's news.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.968
Bad news.

15:43.969 --> 15:45.178
I'm ill.

15:45.262 --> 15:47.014
Nothing definite.

15:47.097 --> 15:50.559
Don't start worrying yourself,
because we're not sure of anything yet.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.728
But it's bad.

15:54.229 --> 15:57.065
Really bad. Isn't it?

15:58.275 --> 16:02.738
And above all, don't tell Alice.

16:03.989 --> 16:04.990
No.

16:05.073 --> 16:08.160
Well, we've had a lovely visit, haven't we?

16:08.243 --> 16:10.829
Yeah, it's been all right, innit?

16:11.830 --> 16:13.582
Well, we have to go.

16:20.505 --> 16:21.673
Bye.

16:22.674 --> 16:25.260
You used to have such beautiful hair.

16:26.261 --> 16:28.013
Thank you.

16:35.896 --> 16:36.980
Bye, Dad.

16:37.981 --> 16:39.441
Bye.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.534
<i>Why not turn to the person next to you
and say, "I'm depressed"?</i>

16:48.617 --> 16:50.911
<i>Remember, don't fight depression.</i>

16:51.537 --> 16:53.497
Make friends with it.

16:55.457 --> 16:59.044
<i>If you're just tuning in,
welcome to</i> Feeling Blue.

16:59.127 --> 17:02.381
<i>Today's phone-in
is all about making a change.</i>

17:02.464 --> 17:05.633
<i>Maybe you're sick of the humdrum nature
of day-to-day life.</i>

17:06.634 --> 17:08.554
<i>You want to make a change.</i>

17:08.637 --> 17:11.306
<i>You want to stop taking the pills.</i>

17:11.390 --> 17:14.601
<i>Today could be the first day
of the rest of your life.</i>

17:15.602 --> 17:19.480
<i>Why not call in to tell us
all about the change you're making?</i>

17:37.583 --> 17:40.127
Have you...? It stinks in here.
Have you washed?

17:40.210 --> 17:41.962
Yeah, loads.

17:42.045 --> 17:45.966
- You need to wash.
- Yeah, and you need to fucking shut it.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.926
- Look. Look.
- What?

17:48.010 --> 17:49.553
- Look.
- What?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.347
I'm claiming money on the sick
for mental health.

17:52.431 --> 17:55.726
They're coming round here shortly
to examine me to make sure I'm a nutjob.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.811
- Why, what's wrong?
- I've got what you've got.

17:57.895 --> 18:00.647
Time of the month?
Yeah, I'm hemorrhaging...

18:00.731 --> 18:03.358
There's nothing wrong with me, Jane.
I'm normal.

18:03.442 --> 18:05.444
Oh, okay, normal period.

18:05.527 --> 18:08.155
Lucy's claiming on depression as well.

18:08.238 --> 18:10.324
Yeah, I'm depressed.

18:10.407 --> 18:11.617
We all are.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.786
So I need you to show me some stuff.
Tell me how to act in front of them.

18:14.870 --> 18:18.415
No, Nic, Nic, Nic, we can't do that.
We'll go to jail.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.459
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine, thank you.

18:20.542 --> 18:21.418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.337
- Yeah? Nothing going on?
- What do you mean?

18:23.420 --> 18:25.255
Is something weird going on in your head?

18:25.339 --> 18:29.218
No, I feel fine, thank you. A-okay.

18:29.301 --> 18:31.762
I take my tablets. Honest, now.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.847
What happens if you don't?

18:33.931 --> 18:35.432
It depends, really.

18:35.515 --> 18:40.354
But around 9:00 every night,
the spiders come out of the walls.

18:40.437 --> 18:43.106
That one there has got a face on him.

18:43.190 --> 18:47.819
The one back there, in the corner,
the mother. Mother, she be like...

18:47.903 --> 18:52.449
And then, over there,
that jumping jack, that...

19:00.874 --> 19:03.335
And then I can get the...

19:05.546 --> 19:06.380
shakes.

19:13.929 --> 19:17.432
She's very, very ill.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.519
Are you okay to talk to me, Nicola?

19:22.896 --> 19:23.855
Go away.

19:24.982 --> 19:26.358
Go away.

19:26.441 --> 19:31.613
- You sad, Mom?
- Less is more. Jail cells.

19:40.747 --> 19:44.668
You won't tell anyone
what happened to you today, will you?

19:44.751 --> 19:47.754
Get the door, quick, quick, quick.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.507
Quick. I'll do it.

19:51.508 --> 19:52.843
Yeah. Go.

19:54.011 --> 19:58.932
Goodbye. Show is over. Good riddance.

20:00.142 --> 20:02.144
How much money have you got now?

20:03.270 --> 20:04.646
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.982
Well, can you lend us some money?

20:07.065 --> 20:10.736
Well, how much?
You haven't paid me back for the bag yet.

20:10.819 --> 20:13.030
- Grand.
- So?

20:13.113 --> 20:14.573
Yeah, well, we need it.

20:18.994 --> 20:20.370
Keep your voice down.

20:23.916 --> 20:26.043
- They're listening.
- What?

20:27.044 --> 20:28.962
Don't wanna scare you.

20:29.046 --> 20:32.299
- What are you talking about?
- The people in the walls.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.927
Don't look.

20:36.470 --> 20:42.517
They can see out,
we can't see in because of the paint.

20:43.727 --> 20:47.105
Don't get too close to the wall, darling.
Come away from the wall.

20:49.107 --> 20:51.151
You get too close, they do drag you in.

21:21.557 --> 21:23.934
Oh, no.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.395
Filthy fucking fuck fuck.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.107
- Left my briefcase.
- It's there.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.944
- Tony's a bastard.
- What?

21:34.027 --> 21:35.988
Tony's a bastard.

21:41.869 --> 21:42.995
I've gotta rush.

21:46.790 --> 21:48.876
Not hungry, am I?

21:48.959 --> 21:50.544
Sorry.

21:53.505 --> 21:54.882
Come here.

21:56.925 --> 21:59.428
- You and Tony okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

21:59.511 --> 22:02.598
Because I saw him kissing another lady.

22:04.099 --> 22:07.185
- Have you been taking your tablets?
- Yes, I am. Thank you.

22:07.269 --> 22:08.979
Don't say such silly things, then.

22:09.062 --> 22:12.941
Okay. Carry on with your day.
Nothing to see here.

22:33.962 --> 22:36.340
Hello? Jane speaking.

22:36.423 --> 22:39.176
<i>Hey. What have you been doing today?</i>

22:39.259 --> 22:43.597
Nothing. I haven't been anywhere,
and I definitely haven't seen anyone, so...

22:43.680 --> 22:45.015
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

22:49.937 --> 22:51.688
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

22:51.772 --> 22:53.023
<i>You all set?</i>

22:53.106 --> 22:54.483
- Yeah.
- <i>Good.</i>

22:54.566 --> 22:56.985
<i>I love you. Don't panic.
This is the right thing to do.</i>

22:57.069 --> 22:58.111
- Yeah.
- <i>Bye.</i>

22:58.195 --> 22:59.863
Bye.

22:59.947 --> 23:01.490
Jack!

23:02.491 --> 23:04.284
It's me.

23:04.368 --> 23:05.702
It's Jane.

23:05.786 --> 23:08.747
Quicker, you fucking... Quick.

23:08.830 --> 23:11.625
Thank you, thank you.
I'm gonna take you back.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.377
Get in.

23:14.628 --> 23:17.089
Doesn't open,
so you're gonna have to climb in.

23:17.172 --> 23:19.508
Yeah, don't do that.

23:26.765 --> 23:27.641
You all right?

23:27.724 --> 23:31.770
<i>If you're just tuning in, welcome, folks.
Today we're talking adoption.</i>

23:31.853 --> 23:35.691
<i>Are you looking to adopt a child, but...?</i>

23:35.774 --> 23:39.361
Did your mother tell you
that I used to be a model?

23:39.444 --> 23:41.864
- No.
- That's weird.

23:41.947 --> 23:48.620
I did. You ask her. No lies.
In fact, I was as beautiful as...

23:51.582 --> 23:55.252
Open it, have a look in there.
Quick, quick. Quicker. Quicker.

23:55.335 --> 23:56.795
Good boy.

23:58.422 --> 24:02.551
I used to compete in beauty pageants.

24:03.260 --> 24:07.723
Yeah. Dropped out because
I'd get nervous, so I never won, did I?

24:09.641 --> 24:10.642
Silly.

24:13.061 --> 24:15.022
This doesn't really look like you.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.274
What's that, now?

24:19.234 --> 24:21.778
It just don't really look like you.

24:23.447 --> 24:25.115
What?

24:40.130 --> 24:41.673
<i>Welcome back.</i>

24:41.757 --> 24:45.010
<i>Today we're talking about
how you might dispose of a body.</i>

25:16.875 --> 25:18.544
Shit.

25:28.845 --> 25:31.265
I'll just put it on now.

25:41.066 --> 25:42.651
That's better.

25:44.444 --> 25:45.863
What happened?

25:46.864 --> 25:49.032
You were attacked, Jack.

25:50.033 --> 25:53.704
Came left of field. You're safe, though.

25:53.787 --> 25:57.666
I fought them off with karate.

26:00.377 --> 26:01.587
What?

26:01.670 --> 26:03.589
What I'm about to say

26:03.672 --> 26:05.299
is gonna sound strange,

26:05.382 --> 26:08.343
because you've taken
a bit of a hit to the head, but...

26:09.344 --> 26:12.431
it's true. Okay?

26:16.560 --> 26:18.228
I'm your mother.

26:19.980 --> 26:22.149
When I had you, the doctor said...

26:23.150 --> 26:25.110
I was ill. I wasn't ill.

26:26.111 --> 26:30.741
So my sister Alice, "your mother"...

26:31.950 --> 26:34.786
took you in and adopted you.

26:34.870 --> 26:36.914
I'm your mother.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.585
That's the truth.
Honest, now, no lies involved.

26:44.796 --> 26:46.798
How do you feel about that, then?

26:46.882 --> 26:49.760
- Quite tired.
- You're not tired.

26:49.843 --> 26:50.969
Yeah, I am.

26:51.053 --> 26:55.098
Are you ready to come with me
and meet Daddy?

27:11.657 --> 27:13.617
Don't drink that.

27:13.700 --> 27:17.663
It's quite expensive.
Even I don't know where I...

27:21.124 --> 27:22.626
am.

27:26.004 --> 27:28.257
- What happened to your head? What?
- I was attacked.

27:28.340 --> 27:31.468
- Yeah, he was attacked. Don't ask.
- Jane!

27:31.552 --> 27:34.513
You need to understand,
you can't fucking do this...

27:34.596 --> 27:38.308
- Don't shout at her, she's not a child.
- Yeah, tone it down, Tony.

27:38.392 --> 27:41.270
- Tell her to stop acting like one, then.
- You're acting like one.

27:41.353 --> 27:42.854
Here we go.

27:42.938 --> 27:45.566
Taking sides with her family again.
It's always the same!

27:45.649 --> 27:49.069
- In other news, Mom came around. She's ill.
- She's not ill.

27:49.152 --> 27:51.655
She reckons she is,
and she reckons you're jealous.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.241
Filling your head with bullshit.
Tony will drive you home.

27:54.324 --> 27:56.118
I'll get a cab, it's fine.

27:56.201 --> 27:58.537
- Auntie Jane has a car.
- No.

27:58.620 --> 28:01.206
No, I don't. I don't have a...

28:01.290 --> 28:06.837
He's playing silly buggers
because he took a... to the head.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.839
Jack, if you continue to lie,

28:08.922 --> 28:13.218
your nose will grow really large, like...

28:13.302 --> 28:17.014
this fuckhead here, Tony, your dad.

28:18.515 --> 28:20.726
- Are we going, or...?
- Yeah.

28:20.809 --> 28:24.104
Because I ain't got the... for a cab, have I?

28:43.665 --> 28:46.460
Are you sleeping with another lady?

28:47.961 --> 28:50.339
No, Jane. I'm not.

29:03.894 --> 29:05.854
Guess I'm out of here.

29:14.988 --> 29:16.907
Come on.

29:17.908 --> 29:20.953
Bring it on.

29:30.003 --> 29:32.256
Thanks for the lift.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.887
<i>Where have you been tonight?</i>

29:40.013 --> 29:42.766
- Just out.
- <i>Where?</i>

29:42.849 --> 29:44.476
I miss you.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.521
- I'm sorry.
- <i>What do you mean you're sorry?</i>

29:47.604 --> 29:50.315
I'm sorry I couldn't get him.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.028
<i>You make me feel like I can't trust you.</i>

29:55.112 --> 29:58.448
You can. I'm really sorry.

29:58.532 --> 30:00.075
You can trust me.

30:00.993 --> 30:04.663
<i>Oh, yeah? Prove it.</i>

30:05.664 --> 30:09.501
<i>I will. I'll get him this time, I promise.</i>

30:44.661 --> 30:46.997
- Who are you supposed to be?
- My fucking self.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.082
- Happy birthday. Well done.
- Where's Lucy?

30:49.166 --> 30:50.417
With the wicked witch.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.877
- What? Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.380
She can keep her, for all I care.
Have you spoken to Jane?

30:55.464 --> 30:57.507
Not yet. Why?

30:57.591 --> 31:00.802
Keeps talking about things
in the walls again. Her place stinks.

31:03.055 --> 31:04.556
Come here.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.434
Come here, Jack. Quick, quick, quick.

31:08.435 --> 31:10.020
Come here.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.065
You're real.

31:13.148 --> 31:17.444
Listen to me, because I need to tell you
something, and this is important.

31:17.528 --> 31:21.031
There are people here who are Frankensteins,

31:21.114 --> 31:24.493
i.e. dead.

31:24.576 --> 31:26.578
They have no...

31:27.913 --> 31:29.039
pulse.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.083
You get me?

31:32.584 --> 31:36.046
These people aren't just here.

31:36.129 --> 31:38.006
They're everywhere.

31:38.090 --> 31:40.092
Look at me.

31:41.969 --> 31:45.013
They are hard to spot
because they look just like us,

31:45.097 --> 31:46.682
but they're not us.

31:46.765 --> 31:49.810
They are nasty.

31:49.893 --> 31:53.730
Don't be scared. I'm here to save you.

31:55.274 --> 31:57.901
I know what I needed to tell you.

31:57.985 --> 32:00.946
Say it with me, "cannibalism."

32:03.532 --> 32:06.410
Floors do open up.

32:06.493 --> 32:09.162
Cannibalism do drag you down.

32:12.791 --> 32:15.127
No. No.

32:16.044 --> 32:17.337
No...

32:22.342 --> 32:25.762
I know. You mustn't panic, though.

32:32.227 --> 32:34.104
Jack.

32:36.815 --> 32:38.233
The fridge.

32:38.317 --> 32:40.694
Go, go, go.

32:50.871 --> 32:54.208
Don't look too hard.

32:55.250 --> 32:58.670
Hurry. Come on. Come on.

32:58.754 --> 33:01.465
There's a way out. This way.

33:03.383 --> 33:04.593
Where are we going?

33:04.676 --> 33:08.388
- Just here. It's all right, Jack. No.
- I wanna go back inside.

33:10.224 --> 33:12.893
- He's here now.
- I wanna go back inside.

33:12.976 --> 33:14.978
Jack, no. Stop it, you fuck!

33:19.399 --> 33:22.819
Johnny. Here he is.

33:23.820 --> 33:25.781
Thank you.

33:29.660 --> 33:30.869
Where's he going?

33:30.953 --> 33:32.454
Jane?

33:32.538 --> 33:34.831
What are you doing?

33:34.915 --> 33:36.542
Jack?

33:38.210 --> 33:41.129
They know. The trees know it.

33:42.256 --> 33:44.341
The trees in the woods.

33:44.424 --> 33:45.968
You see...

33:46.051 --> 33:48.762
a car's died and it...

33:48.845 --> 33:52.432
So I turned it over.

33:53.934 --> 33:55.310
Where you going?

33:55.394 --> 33:57.104
You're back here?

33:58.105 --> 34:01.400
I got him. I got him.

34:05.445 --> 34:08.614
Where? Where?

34:14.079 --> 34:15.539
Where?

34:27.300 --> 34:29.052
All right.

35:47.381 --> 35:49.174
Tired.

36:03.522 --> 36:04.773
Hello.

36:04.856 --> 36:06.567
I'm...

36:29.006 --> 36:31.133
- What's she doing?
- Getting ready for the pageant.

36:31.216 --> 36:32.634
Give me my dress back.

36:32.718 --> 36:35.637
You're making it very difficult
for people to like you.

36:35.721 --> 36:39.224
- People do like me.
- Who? Johnny?

36:39.308 --> 36:41.768
What's going on?

36:41.852 --> 36:44.938
That's my dress. I made it.

36:45.022 --> 36:46.732
- She won't give it back.
- I warned you,

36:46.815 --> 36:49.443
but you wouldn't take any notice.
Now you've ruined everything.

36:49.526 --> 36:51.320
- Mom, she's gone through a lot.
- Shut up.

36:51.403 --> 36:53.113
No, she really...

36:59.244 --> 37:00.704
There we are. That looks lovely.

37:55.968 --> 37:59.054
...for what we are about to receive.

38:02.099 --> 38:04.601
What comes ne... What's next?

38:04.685 --> 38:06.353
- "Amen."
- Amen.

38:06.436 --> 38:07.271
Yeah.

38:08.272 --> 38:11.400
Yeah, it's... Well, let's eat.

38:25.289 --> 38:26.707
Jane, eat.

38:26.790 --> 38:28.876
The cars won't stop and I...

38:28.959 --> 38:31.378
Don't know if he will be home, but...

38:31.461 --> 38:35.299
Just cut it when he talks and I know and...

38:38.385 --> 38:39.970
What?

38:40.053 --> 38:43.056
In the forestry, it's all right.

38:43.140 --> 38:47.477
We just... Yeah. And I stopped the cars and...

38:47.561 --> 38:50.731
Trying a bit, but you can't...

38:51.732 --> 38:54.985
And like... And... Yeah.

38:55.986 --> 38:57.654
Yeah.

39:47.955 --> 39:50.666
You're all ants.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.377
Ants.

39:55.212 --> 39:56.255
Ant.

39:57.047 --> 39:59.758
It's a bloody ant farm.

40:02.886 --> 40:07.599
I'm trapped in the cage of a pestilent beast
and that beast was named anxiety.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.606
Jane?

40:14.690 --> 40:16.483
No, I don't know you.

40:16.567 --> 40:18.235
It's Mike.

40:18.318 --> 40:20.279
No. No.

40:20.362 --> 40:22.489
You don't remember me?

40:23.907 --> 40:26.368
The guy who used to...

40:26.451 --> 40:29.496
- fiddle with his dog.
- Oh, fu...

40:31.623 --> 40:34.293
Are they still saying that?
What else do they say?

40:34.376 --> 40:35.752
Stuff, you know.

40:38.130 --> 40:40.424
- You're fucking beautiful.
- Shut up.

40:40.507 --> 40:43.760
You're the most beautiful thing
I've seen today.

40:43.844 --> 40:46.513
- Will you shut up?
- What's your favorite drink?

40:48.432 --> 40:50.893
Half of a lager, shandy top.

40:50.976 --> 40:54.062
Right. Well, will you allow me
to treat you

40:54.146 --> 40:55.689
- to half of a lager, shandy top?
- No.

40:59.693 --> 41:02.279
Don't listen to what these ants here
are telling you.

41:02.362 --> 41:04.448
Mike. I don't know you,

41:04.531 --> 41:07.784
and I'm not looking for a sexual partner
at the moment, thank you.

41:07.868 --> 41:09.745
- So, no, don't...
- They won't get in the way

41:09.828 --> 41:12.206
- of the development of our love.
- No, we're not in love.

41:12.289 --> 41:14.875
So don't go spreading that.

41:14.958 --> 41:16.919
- When can I see you again?
- I don't know you.

41:17.002 --> 41:19.171
You can't because I got
a doctor's appointment now.

41:19.254 --> 41:21.006
- I'll come in.
- No, you stay there.

41:21.089 --> 41:23.133
- I'll come in because I know him.
- No, you don't.

41:23.217 --> 41:25.969
No, stay. You stay there.

41:26.053 --> 41:27.679
Right there.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.933
I've got something for you.

41:38.357 --> 41:39.274
You're dead.

41:39.358 --> 41:41.193
- What?
- React.

41:45.072 --> 41:47.115
- You're dead.
- All right.

42:15.269 --> 42:18.438
Would you like to spend more time with me?

42:24.945 --> 42:26.446
Can I think about it?

42:28.115 --> 42:30.284
I'm fine, thanks. Thanks.

42:38.584 --> 42:42.629
Yes. I would like to spend
more time with you.

43:06.195 --> 43:07.905
Yeah.

43:13.577 --> 43:16.747
I must've kept it from when I was a kid.

43:20.167 --> 43:22.169
I used to be a model.

43:23.170 --> 43:25.923
- No lies involved either.
- Yeah.

43:26.924 --> 43:28.050
I know.

43:28.133 --> 43:30.469
- I was stunning, wasn't I?
- Yeah.

43:30.552 --> 43:34.014
- You can ask Alice.
- I will.

43:37.142 --> 43:38.894
Thanks.

43:42.731 --> 43:43.899
Yeah, thanks.

43:44.900 --> 43:48.111
- So how you been?
- Yeah. Not good.

43:50.322 --> 43:53.033
I mean, things were looking up for a...

43:53.116 --> 43:55.077
About a month.

43:55.160 --> 43:58.247
Few years back, but...

44:00.040 --> 44:03.168
- Oh, listen to me. How've you been?
- Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

44:03.252 --> 44:04.670
Yeah.

44:04.753 --> 44:06.588
What you been doing?

44:08.090 --> 44:13.303
- Nothing. Just living in my flat.
- Yeah? That's nice.

44:13.387 --> 44:15.681
I wish they'd give me one of them.

44:15.764 --> 44:19.643
I don't have a place at the moment,
another attractive quality.

44:26.483 --> 44:28.485
You look amazing.

44:34.783 --> 44:36.869
- <i>Do you remember my band?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

44:36.952 --> 44:39.580
<i>Yeah, we were quite shit, but...</i>

44:39.663 --> 44:43.959
<i>I had this plan to release a killer album
and then die young,</i>

44:44.042 --> 44:47.713
<i>remain credible, but it's a...</i>

44:47.796 --> 44:51.633
<i>Anyway, I got the band back together
about a year ago and...</i>

44:51.717 --> 44:53.760
<i>I'm doing a gig soon if you wanna come.</i>

44:53.844 --> 44:56.680
Well, you could say I'm a...

44:56.763 --> 44:58.974
Well, I'm like a rock star now.

44:59.057 --> 45:02.895
Very inspirated by Nirvana, for example.

45:02.978 --> 45:05.856
The Truth.
Very much inspirated by The Truth.

45:06.857 --> 45:08.609
You know...

45:11.320 --> 45:13.363
What time's your gig?

45:25.459 --> 45:27.586
<i>This is for Jane.</i>

45:34.676 --> 45:36.970
<i>So? What'd you think?</i>

45:38.597 --> 45:40.807
Well done. Very good.

45:41.266 --> 45:44.269
<i>Don't drink the water</i>

45:44.353 --> 45:46.438
<i>Unless you want your life</i>

45:46.521 --> 45:49.650
Well, what was your favorite bits?

45:52.069 --> 45:54.071
Well... The singing.

45:54.154 --> 45:56.657
<i>We're the Truth Detectives</i>

45:56.740 --> 46:00.077
<i>And detecting truth is what we do</i>

46:00.160 --> 46:05.499
<i>And when you're least expecting us
You better look out 'cause</i>

46:05.582 --> 46:07.334
<i>We'll be inspecting you</i>

46:07.834 --> 46:08.877
You all right?

46:09.962 --> 46:11.672
So I've been thinking,

46:11.755 --> 46:15.008
maybe you're not ill.

46:15.092 --> 46:17.302
Maybe you're an experiment.

46:17.386 --> 46:21.348
Maybe we're all an experiment
for something else, that what's going on.

46:21.431 --> 46:23.684
I'm not ill anymore. I'm fine.

46:23.767 --> 46:25.394
Yeah. Well, it's...

46:26.395 --> 46:29.523
It's the world that's sick, innit?
The world is...

46:29.606 --> 46:31.984
You know? And we're all being controlled.

46:32.067 --> 46:34.820
Or even controlled into thinking
that we're not controlled.

46:34.903 --> 46:38.407
<i>The queen's a shape-shifter
You think she's weak and feeble</i>

46:38.490 --> 46:41.952
<i>But she's got the strength of a weightlifter
She's got the beak of a seagull</i>

46:42.035 --> 46:44.788
They control everything.
They control what we eat, what we watch.

46:44.872 --> 46:46.999
It's the same mind-numbing fucking shit.

46:47.082 --> 46:50.586
Amusing little plays. Me and the Detectives,
we don't stand a fucking chance.

46:50.669 --> 46:53.422
<i>Death, death
No breath</i>

46:53.505 --> 46:57.593
Same false advertisement
for how wonderful the world is

46:57.676 --> 47:00.596
while they're keeping a needle in
the population behind closed doors.

47:00.679 --> 47:03.891
And everything we're taught
is a fictitious lie.

47:06.435 --> 47:07.436
I can't...

47:08.437 --> 47:11.398
I'm sorry. I can't believe
you've seen me perform.

47:11.481 --> 47:14.610
- I feel like I should see you perform.
- I don't sing.

47:14.693 --> 47:16.195
Yeah, I know, but it's like...

47:16.278 --> 47:19.531
Because you've seen,
like, the deepest, darkest part of me,

47:19.615 --> 47:24.328
which is the truth, because I'm at
my most exposed when I'm, well, serenading.

47:24.411 --> 47:27.497
I bet you could sing.
I bet you could sing like a fucking bird.

47:27.581 --> 47:28.916
You could be in the band.

47:28.999 --> 47:30.292
I don't sing.

47:42.596 --> 47:48.060
<i>First, I was afraid, I was terrified</i>

47:49.228 --> 47:56.026
<i>Thinking I could never live
Without you by my side</i>

47:57.027 --> 48:00.405
<i>But I've been so many long</i>

48:01.406 --> 48:05.160
<i>Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

48:13.877 --> 48:15.671
<i>But now you're back</i>

48:16.672 --> 48:18.924
<i>From outer space</i>

48:19.925 --> 48:26.223
<i>I didn't bump into anyone...</i>

48:34.690 --> 48:37.442
Oh, that was fucking beautiful.

48:37.526 --> 48:39.361
I don't sing.

48:42.531 --> 48:44.616
- Jane?
- Yeah.

48:44.700 --> 48:47.619
I'm going to act on a feeling now,

48:47.703 --> 48:50.247
and I want you to tell me
whether or not you agree.

49:11.226 --> 49:13.020
I agree.

50:10.827 --> 50:12.454
Oh, my...

50:54.872 --> 50:59.626
<i>Jane, oh, Jane, you're my kind of cocaine</i>

51:00.627 --> 51:04.423
<i>You're my little chicken</i>

51:04.506 --> 51:07.801
<i>Little chicken jail mate</i>

51:10.888 --> 51:12.848
You're my muse.

51:14.182 --> 51:15.767
Lovely.

51:20.981 --> 51:23.275
I think I love you.

51:25.569 --> 51:28.238
I definitely love you.

51:39.374 --> 51:40.667
Just keeps the kidneys strong.

51:40.751 --> 51:42.961
- You'll feel much better.
- I was thinking of...

51:43.045 --> 51:46.089
Right. I've got an announcement to make,
so everyone, shut the fuck up!

51:50.219 --> 51:52.054
I'm dying.

51:58.602 --> 52:00.896
That's a lie. I'm getting married.

52:00.979 --> 52:02.314
We're getting married.

52:02.397 --> 52:03.774
Of course you are.

52:03.857 --> 52:05.984
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What's your name?

52:06.068 --> 52:07.486
- Lesley.
- Lesley? Nice.

52:07.569 --> 52:11.281
- It means I'm happy for you.
- Good, because Lesley's ecstatic.

52:12.324 --> 52:14.076
I'm in my oils.

52:15.077 --> 52:16.995
Never been happier.

52:19.081 --> 52:22.709
So, Mike, have you got a job?

52:23.710 --> 52:24.711
Negative. No.

52:24.795 --> 52:26.463
So how do you make money?

52:26.547 --> 52:30.217
Well, I used to work
in a bread factory, making bread,

52:30.300 --> 52:34.304
but now, technically, I gig, but that's art,

52:34.388 --> 52:38.850
and I don't consider art as a job.

52:38.934 --> 52:41.603
But you get paid?

52:41.687 --> 52:43.063
Again, technically...

52:44.064 --> 52:46.358
- He's so good.
- Shut up.

52:47.359 --> 52:50.863
I'll tell you what, Lesley,
the old bag of nuts surprised me.

52:52.364 --> 52:54.032
They should know. Maybe I should...?

52:54.116 --> 52:57.452
They... They should know.

52:58.453 --> 53:04.418
Jane is going to be the second
lead vocalist in my band.

53:04.501 --> 53:05.377
Why?

53:05.460 --> 53:07.546
Because she's fucking good.

53:07.629 --> 53:09.006
Sorry about the dirty word.

53:09.089 --> 53:14.094
Mike, he reckons I've got what it takes.

53:14.177 --> 53:16.513
Like Celine Dion.

53:16.597 --> 53:18.140
Better.

53:19.182 --> 53:22.811
Better. Mike reckons
I'm better than Celine Dion.

53:24.855 --> 53:30.235
I mean, this could really take off,
you know, especially with what she's got,

53:30.319 --> 53:32.112
and it's like a new angle.

53:32.196 --> 53:35.324
We could be looking at the next,
I don't know, Dory Previn.

53:35.407 --> 53:37.784
- What do you mean "with what she's got"?
- Talent.

53:37.868 --> 53:39.494
Talent. With her talent.

53:39.578 --> 53:41.371
I'm really going for it.

53:41.455 --> 53:43.999
Right. Well, let's make a toast.

53:44.082 --> 53:45.751
Never seen us all so happy.

53:45.834 --> 53:47.002
Tell them.

53:48.003 --> 53:49.880
To me,

53:49.963 --> 53:52.466
because I'm getting married.

53:52.549 --> 53:53.926
And to happiness.

53:55.260 --> 53:58.472
- And to Mike moving in with me.
- Yes!

53:58.555 --> 54:00.265
- What?
- Yeah.

54:00.349 --> 54:01.266
That's quick.

54:01.350 --> 54:04.311
Yeah, well, we like each other, so...

54:04.394 --> 54:07.481
That doesn't mean you have
to move in with each other.

54:07.564 --> 54:10.317
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- Oh, yeah, I'm just checking.

54:10.400 --> 54:14.738
Because it's a big thing to move in
with someone, so I'm just checking.

54:14.821 --> 54:16.657
I wanna do what I want.

54:16.740 --> 54:18.700
You let me do what I want.

54:18.784 --> 54:21.328
I want Mike to move in with me.

54:22.663 --> 54:24.081
Treat me like a child.

54:26.792 --> 54:28.418
Becoming like Mom.

54:45.060 --> 54:47.062
There's something else.

54:51.984 --> 54:53.193
Jane...

54:54.194 --> 54:55.404
will you marry me?

54:56.321 --> 54:57.614
Where's the ring?

55:00.367 --> 55:01.827
Yes.

55:07.291 --> 55:08.500
Congratulations.

55:08.584 --> 55:10.043
No.

55:11.378 --> 55:12.838
Sorry, Mike...

55:13.839 --> 55:16.508
I just don't think this is a good idea.

55:16.592 --> 55:18.468
- What?
- I just don't.

55:18.552 --> 55:20.304
Why can't you be happy for me?

55:20.387 --> 55:22.890
- I am.
- No, you're not.

55:32.733 --> 55:34.818
- We're leaving.
- No. Jane, sorry. I...

55:34.902 --> 55:38.280
You're just jealous because I've got someone
that actually pays attention to me.

55:38.363 --> 55:41.617
He's cheating on you,
and you can't even see it!

55:45.454 --> 55:47.372
Tell her. Go on, tell her, Tony.

55:47.456 --> 55:50.500
- Tell her the truth. Go on.
- You need to start taking your medication.

55:50.584 --> 55:52.878
And you need to fuck right off.

56:12.105 --> 56:15.317
Not one of my kids has visited me.

56:17.694 --> 56:19.363
What does that say?

56:21.114 --> 56:22.407
That...

56:22.491 --> 56:24.451
Do they know I'm ill?

56:26.119 --> 56:28.038
Yeah, yeah.

56:29.164 --> 56:31.708
Alice doesn't believe you.

56:35.796 --> 56:37.756
Would you mind if I talk to
my daughter alone?

56:37.839 --> 56:39.883
No. No.

56:39.967 --> 56:42.511
No, Mom, you...

56:42.594 --> 56:46.265
It's fine. You can say what you like
in front of Mike. He's not gonna go.

56:46.348 --> 56:48.934
He's not... He's not gonna...

56:50.519 --> 56:52.271
go spreading stuff. He...

56:52.354 --> 56:54.022
- I'm not a snitch.
- He's not a snitch.

56:54.106 --> 56:55.065
I'm very loyal.

56:56.608 --> 56:59.111
You're not marrying this fool.

56:59.194 --> 57:01.655
You can preach all you like to me,
it's not happening.

57:01.738 --> 57:04.116
Why? Why?

57:04.199 --> 57:05.701
Give me your hand.

57:05.784 --> 57:07.369
- No, I'm not...
- Shut up!

57:07.452 --> 57:09.329
- I don't want...
- Give me your hand.

57:09.413 --> 57:11.790
- No, don't... Don't...
- No...

57:11.874 --> 57:14.710
It's all right. I'm comfortable facing
whatever's ahead of me.

57:14.793 --> 57:16.378
You don't know what she's gonna do.

57:37.816 --> 57:39.860
There's a devil inside you.

57:43.030 --> 57:45.157
Stay away from her, you fuckhead!

57:45.240 --> 57:46.283
Mom, stop it.

57:47.284 --> 57:49.995
We're put on this earth with a purpose.

57:51.455 --> 57:53.498
Do you want to know what your purpose is?

57:54.499 --> 57:55.334
No.

58:00.881 --> 58:02.674
You need to wake up.

58:04.343 --> 58:07.054
I'll wake up when I want to.

58:09.806 --> 58:12.267
I'll pay you back when the band get a deal.

58:12.351 --> 58:14.228
When do you think that will be? Soon?

58:15.229 --> 58:17.022
Any day now.

58:17.105 --> 58:18.899
Okay. Thank you.

58:18.982 --> 58:20.692
You're welcome.

58:43.715 --> 58:45.425
<i>Jane?</i>

58:46.510 --> 58:48.220
Jane.

58:51.640 --> 58:54.393
- What's wrong?
- He's gone.

58:57.271 --> 58:58.605
Where is he?

58:58.689 --> 58:59.982
It's Lesley.

59:00.983 --> 59:02.651
He's dead. He's gone.

59:05.279 --> 59:07.364
He went peacefully.

59:14.496 --> 59:16.331
Did he?

59:16.415 --> 59:17.499
No, it's fine.

59:18.500 --> 59:21.044
We were married, so I'll be fine.

59:23.380 --> 59:24.214
Jane.

59:25.299 --> 59:26.800
Nicola?

59:26.884 --> 59:28.969
I think I'm like you.

59:29.970 --> 59:34.558
I keep hearing voices in the walls,
and they won't go away.

59:36.768 --> 59:39.396
Can I stay with you till I get
Lesley's money?

59:43.567 --> 59:46.445
How long do you think that will be, then?

59:47.696 --> 59:49.198
Probably a while.

59:50.199 --> 59:51.992
- Nicola.
- Yeah?

59:52.075 --> 59:54.578
How long is "a while"?

59:56.121 --> 01:00:00.542
<i>Do you ever wake up and think,
"Something's not right"?</i>

01:00:03.629 --> 01:00:07.132
<i>You look older.</i>

01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:13.597
<i>Then you need Eternal Beauty.</i>

01:00:14.598 --> 01:00:16.141
<i>It's working.</i>

01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:21.355
<i>Taking you from faceless to flawless.</i>

01:00:26.693 --> 01:00:28.153
Let's have one of those.

01:00:29.238 --> 01:00:32.658
- No.
- Come on, I've got what you've got.

01:00:33.825 --> 01:00:36.954
They're mine. You can't.

01:00:39.998 --> 01:00:41.750
Anyway, I take...

01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:45.420
Don't need to take them anymore. I'm all...

01:00:46.421 --> 01:00:47.839
good.

01:00:49.007 --> 01:00:50.092
Just...

01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:57.099
You sick?

01:00:57.182 --> 01:01:01.019
Well, my illness don't really
have a medical definition.

01:01:03.939 --> 01:01:06.316
You two make such a cute couple.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.318
Thank you.

01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:15.450
Did Jane ever tell you I was a beauty queen?

01:01:15.534 --> 01:01:17.077
- That was you? Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.079
Yeah, I won stuff.

01:01:19.162 --> 01:01:21.039
Top tier. I won most of it.

01:01:21.123 --> 01:01:22.583
Didn't I, Jane?

01:01:23.584 --> 01:01:25.252
Yeah. She was really pretty.

01:01:25.335 --> 01:01:27.170
- Yeah.
- Nice.

01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:29.548
She still is, really.

01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:30.841
A bit.

01:01:31.842 --> 01:01:34.928
We used to have loads of photos.
We should get them out one day.

01:01:35.012 --> 01:01:38.307
I wore this stunning blue dress.

01:01:40.225 --> 01:01:41.935
They told me I was a natural.

01:01:49.193 --> 01:01:51.153
Like this:

01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:07.169
Took me right back.

01:02:14.927 --> 01:02:17.012
<i>I did the same,</i>

01:02:17.095 --> 01:02:18.347
<i>but I didn't get...</i>

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:21.183
<i>They knew that I couldn't...</i>

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:25.145
<i>I wasn't very good.</i>

01:02:26.647 --> 01:02:30.234
<i>Are we gonna win? No, I wasn't gonna win it.</i>

01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:32.861
<i>You tried, but you weren't...</i>

01:02:32.945 --> 01:02:35.739
<i>Wasn't good. She wasn't good.</i>

01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:54.151
No!

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:11.168
No! No!

01:04:11.251 --> 01:04:14.963
No, no, no!

01:06:38.106 --> 01:06:41.568
Get off me! Get off me!

01:06:41.652 --> 01:06:44.363
Get off me! Help!

01:06:44.446 --> 01:06:47.032
- Don't look.
- They're stealing me!

01:06:47.115 --> 01:06:48.742
They're stealing me!

01:06:48.825 --> 01:06:50.786
Alice! They're stealing me!

01:06:50.869 --> 01:06:52.579
Alice! Help!

01:06:58.544 --> 01:07:01.213
<i>That was Beth Orton with "Blood..."</i>

01:07:02.214 --> 01:07:04.216
<i>If you're just tuning in, welcome.</i>

01:07:04.299 --> 01:07:07.261
<i>Today's question,
why would you not kill yourself?</i>

01:07:07.344 --> 01:07:08.971
<i>We're gonna be opening this up.</i>

01:07:09.054 --> 01:07:12.641
<i>I'm gonna kick it off with I think
you should kill yourself if you want to.</i>

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:16.395
<i>In fact, if you are thinking about doing it
and are strong enough to go through with it,</i>

01:07:16.478 --> 01:07:18.981
<i>why not call in beforehand to tell us why?</i>

01:07:19.064 --> 01:07:21.233
- <i>Hello, caller.</i>
- <i>Yes. Hello.</i>

01:07:21.316 --> 01:07:23.235
<i>Why are you killing yourself?</i>

01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:25.195
<i>Because...</i>

01:07:26.822 --> 01:07:27.948
Turn it off!

01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:30.242
Turn it off! Turn it off!

01:07:30.325 --> 01:07:31.827
Turn it off!

01:08:19.124 --> 01:08:20.750
Hi.

01:08:59.622 --> 01:09:01.332
Thank you.

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:05.002
- Should I take it?
- Yes, please.

01:09:05.087 --> 01:09:06.629
You can take all of it.

01:09:06.712 --> 01:09:08.924
- Now?
- Yes.

01:09:10.299 --> 01:09:11.843
Okay.

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:15.138
Thank you.

01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:07.107
Hi.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.276
What's the food like?

01:10:10.819 --> 01:10:12.654
Normal.

01:10:12.738 --> 01:10:14.072
Pink.

01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:17.993
I'm shitting pink peas.

01:10:20.996 --> 01:10:22.414
Yeah.

01:10:26.835 --> 01:10:29.379
Am I coming with you now?

01:10:34.343 --> 01:10:35.385
Here you go.

01:10:36.386 --> 01:10:37.846
What's that?

01:10:39.473 --> 01:10:40.933
It's beautiful. Thank you.

01:10:41.934 --> 01:10:43.685
Open it. Go on.

01:10:43.769 --> 01:10:45.312
Okay.

01:10:46.772 --> 01:10:48.106
I'll help you open it.

01:10:49.107 --> 01:10:51.318
- I'll do it.
- All right, you do it.

01:10:51.401 --> 01:10:52.778
I got it.

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.616
Doctor said that'll get your hair back
the way it was.

01:10:58.617 --> 01:11:00.661
- Once a day...
- Yeah?

01:11:01.286 --> 01:11:02.871
for two weeks.

01:11:06.833 --> 01:11:08.001
It's beautiful.

01:11:10.963 --> 01:11:14.299
Can we go now?
I'm getting sick of this place.

01:11:14.383 --> 01:11:16.843
Hello, Lucy.

01:11:24.685 --> 01:11:26.270
Mommy.

01:11:28.605 --> 01:11:30.774
I can't take the pills.

01:11:33.068 --> 01:11:34.903
I can't take them anymore.

01:11:34.987 --> 01:11:36.780
They make me too tired.

01:11:36.864 --> 01:11:40.242
Jane, it's making you better.

01:11:42.369 --> 01:11:44.329
I don't think so.

01:11:45.873 --> 01:11:47.124
Is it?

01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:51.712
Are you sure?

01:11:57.593 --> 01:11:59.011
Let's go.

01:12:00.888 --> 01:12:01.722
Where...?

01:12:02.723 --> 01:12:04.349
Where are you going?

01:12:05.392 --> 01:12:06.560
Where are you going?

01:12:07.853 --> 01:12:09.354
Won't be long.

01:12:09.438 --> 01:12:10.772
Okay.

01:12:15.319 --> 01:12:16.820
For what?

01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:22.117
Bye.

01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:34.046
And I don't wanna... Can't come with you.

01:13:01.031 --> 01:13:02.491
<i>It's me.</i>

01:13:04.076 --> 01:13:06.703
<i>What have you been doing today?</i>

01:13:08.622 --> 01:13:09.748
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:12.834
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

01:13:38.485 --> 01:13:40.279
I'm sorry.

01:14:12.394 --> 01:14:14.062
Help!

01:14:14.146 --> 01:14:16.982
- They're stealing me!
- Stop her!

01:14:17.983 --> 01:14:20.944
I've just gonna get through
to the other side!

01:14:21.028 --> 01:14:25.324
I've just gonna get through
to the other side!

01:14:26.283 --> 01:14:27.910
No! Get off!

01:14:50.015 --> 01:14:55.229
No, don't come here anymore.

01:15:32.057 --> 01:15:33.850
<i>I've missed you.</i>

01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:35.978
<i>Have you missed me?</i>

01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:39.147
Yeah.

01:15:42.359 --> 01:15:44.152
Where are you?

01:15:45.237 --> 01:15:46.488
You didn't turn up.

01:15:47.489 --> 01:15:49.074
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:15:49.157 --> 01:15:50.659
<i>I want to see you.</i>

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.537
I know, but you didn't.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.039
You... You didn't turn up. You didn't.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:59.251
I've missed you so much.

01:15:59.334 --> 01:16:01.253
<i>I've missed you too.</i>

01:16:01.336 --> 01:16:03.422
- <i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>
- Okay.

01:16:04.423 --> 01:16:05.924
<i>I want to take care of you.</i>

01:16:06.925 --> 01:16:09.595
<i>You're the love of my life, Jane.
You're my everything.</i>

01:16:10.596 --> 01:16:12.180
<i>I promise I won't let a day pass</i>

01:16:12.264 --> 01:16:15.017
<i>where I don't love you
with all the love in my heart.</i>

01:16:16.685 --> 01:16:17.936
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.480
Yeah. Yeah, I do. I do.

01:16:20.564 --> 01:16:21.815
Please.

01:16:21.899 --> 01:16:24.193
<i>You're the love of my life.
You're my everything, Jane.</i>

01:16:24.276 --> 01:16:25.819
I love you.

01:16:25.903 --> 01:16:29.323
<i>I won't let a day pass where I don't
love you with all the love in my heart.</i>

01:16:29.406 --> 01:16:31.366
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:34.453
I just want things to go back...

01:16:35.829 --> 01:16:37.039
to how they were.

01:16:37.122 --> 01:16:40.500
<i>You're the love of my life, Jane.
You're my... I promise... I love you...</i>

01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:43.712
<i>You're my everything, Jane.
I promise I won't let a day pass...</i>

01:16:43.795 --> 01:16:47.049
<i>I won't let a day pass
where I don't love you with all the love...</i>

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:50.344
<i>I will love you
with all the love in my heart.</i>

01:16:51.428 --> 01:16:52.262
- <i>Jane.</i>
- <i>Jane?</i>

01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:54.181
<i>Jane. Jane? Jane?</i>

01:16:54.264 --> 01:16:56.934
- <i>Jane? Jane! Jane!</i>
- <i>Jane? Jane? Jane!</i>

01:18:30.777 --> 01:18:32.571
Your mother wants to see you.

01:18:34.865 --> 01:18:36.283
Go now.

01:18:36.366 --> 01:18:38.118
Go, go.

01:19:29.211 --> 01:19:30.796
Come here.

01:19:53.485 --> 01:19:54.987
Yes?

01:20:06.832 --> 01:20:08.750
Is she dead yet?

01:20:08.834 --> 01:20:09.960
Not yet.

01:20:39.364 --> 01:20:40.699
Dead?

01:21:00.093 --> 01:21:01.637
Jane?

01:21:05.432 --> 01:21:06.808
Mom.

01:21:08.727 --> 01:21:10.229
Jane.

01:21:13.106 --> 01:21:15.776
Where are you now?

01:21:19.029 --> 01:21:21.823
Jane, I'm just resting my eyes.

01:21:27.746 --> 01:21:29.623
Well, well, well.

01:21:32.334 --> 01:21:34.253
Welcome back.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.969
I do love you, Mom.

01:21:43.387 --> 01:21:45.180
Oh, I love you too, Jane.

01:21:45.264 --> 01:21:46.807
I know.

01:21:48.183 --> 01:21:50.477
I wanted to tell you something.

01:21:50.561 --> 01:21:51.979
Okay.

01:21:53.313 --> 01:21:56.733
We're all put on this earth for a purpose.

01:21:59.987 --> 01:22:03.240
Do you want to know what your purpose is?

01:22:07.494 --> 01:22:09.413
Yes, please.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.030
<i>Sometimes...</i>

01:22:44.031 --> 01:22:45.699
I wonder...

01:22:46.783 --> 01:22:48.452
why...

01:22:50.454 --> 01:22:51.830
You know...

01:22:54.374 --> 01:23:00.047
People think that because of it,
I must be lonely, but that's not true.

01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:05.552
I've got people talking to me all day long,
you know. Like, all day.

01:23:08.722 --> 01:23:11.391
I got more friends than you, ain't I?

01:23:14.102 --> 01:23:16.021
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.
- Yeah.

01:23:16.104 --> 01:23:17.981
Yeah, I do.

01:23:19.524 --> 01:23:21.151
You don't wanna be normal.

01:23:21.235 --> 01:23:23.278
Trust me.

01:23:23.362 --> 01:23:25.155
- It's hard work.
- Yeah?

01:23:26.156 --> 01:23:28.408
Sometimes I do.

01:23:30.953 --> 01:23:33.747
Most of the time, I like being...

01:23:35.999 --> 01:23:37.834
this powerful.

01:27:13.467 --> 01:27:15.052
What's your name?

01:27:16.637 --> 01:27:18.055
Jane.

01:27:18.138 --> 01:27:19.431
You sure?

01:27:19.514 --> 01:27:21.058
Yes.

01:27:25.479 --> 01:27:26.772
Are you happy?

01:27:30.901 --> 01:27:32.444
Why?

01:27:36.323 --> 01:27:39.284
You don't seem very happy, that's all.

01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:42.287
I'm fine.

01:27:42.371 --> 01:27:43.705
Fine...

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:46.083
or good?

01:27:47.084 --> 01:27:48.418
Fine.

01:27:49.753 --> 01:27:51.380
Are you happy?

01:27:51.463 --> 01:27:54.383
Well, there's no such thing as happiness.

01:27:55.676 --> 01:27:58.637
Only moments of not being depressed.

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.430
Where did you read that?

01:28:01.890 --> 01:28:04.184
Come on, repeat after me.

01:28:04.268 --> 01:28:07.187
I am in my oils.

01:28:07.271 --> 01:28:08.313
No.

01:28:11.775 --> 01:28:12.860
Say it.

01:28:15.696 --> 01:28:17.364
You say it.

01:28:31.336 --> 01:28:34.047
Take some classy photos of me.

01:28:35.048 --> 01:28:38.260
It's important people remember this, okay?

01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:40.304
Okay.

01:28:42.055 --> 01:28:43.307
How do I look?

01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:44.516
Nice.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.727
Nice, or...

01:28:48.061 --> 01:28:49.396
really nice?

01:28:53.275 --> 01:28:54.735
Really nice.

01:28:55.736 --> 01:28:57.112
Thank you.

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:03.160
Some people say I'm
"paranoid schizophrenic,"

01:29:03.243 --> 01:29:05.078
which means I think you're out to kill me,

01:29:05.162 --> 01:29:08.707
as opposed to schizophrenic,
where I'd be out to kill you.

01:29:12.044 --> 01:29:13.420
I'm not gonna kill you, though.

01:29:14.421 --> 01:29:15.839
Fine.

01:29:19.843 --> 01:29:20.969
How about you?

01:29:24.598 --> 01:29:26.058
I'm normal.

01:29:27.434 --> 01:29:29.019
Okay.

01:29:32.564 --> 01:29:34.358
That's boring.
