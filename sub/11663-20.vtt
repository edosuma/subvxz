(mellow music playing)

01:09.600 --> 01:14.000
So, who's the luckiest girl
in the history of the world?

01:14.066 --> 01:15.467
Well, it wasn't your mother.

01:17.467 --> 01:22.467
Me! I'm the luckiest girl in the world.
I finally won a giveaway.

01:22.533 --> 01:25.867
And you said I was stupid
for entering so many contests.

01:25.934 --> 01:29.734
I did?
I find it hard to believe I'd even care.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
This makes it all worthwhile,
all those endless hours licking stamps,

01:35.066 --> 01:39.400
licking envelopes, temporarily losing
my ability to taste sweets.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.367
-Rose, what did you win?
-A free prostate check.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.133
Who's stupid now?

01:52.767 --> 01:54.000
You are.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.333
Yeah, stupid all the way to the bank.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.834
You know what kills me?

01:59.900 --> 02:02.800
When you locked me up at Shady Pines,
she roamed around free.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.000
Would you check my list?

02:08.066 --> 02:11.967
See if I forgot to invite anybody
to my moonlight madness party.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.467
-The women.
-Pardon me?

02:14.834 --> 02:16.000
The women.

02:16.066 --> 02:18.667
You invited 12 men and no women.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.633
I know what you're thinking,
but Rose and Sophia are coming.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.700
You'll have somebody to talk to.

02:25.867 --> 02:28.066
No fair. I talked to her last time.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.633
Blanche, not to doubt your stamina,

02:31.700 --> 02:35.867
but don't you think those
men are going to be bored?

02:35.934 --> 02:37.333
Oh, of course not.

02:37.767 --> 02:39.867
Dorothy, tonight's a full moon,

02:39.934 --> 02:44.667
a night when men's passions, like the
tides, are pulled to their highest,

02:44.734 --> 02:47.367
achingly unbearable peak.

02:47.433 --> 02:51.433
You really think a full moon can do
all that?

02:51.500 --> 02:54.767
Just in case, I'm also filling
a watermelon with tequila.

02:56.567 --> 03:00.900
But it's not just a full moon.
It's a leap year's full moon.

03:00.967 --> 03:02.500
Anything can happen.

03:02.967 --> 03:06.300
All your dreams can come true
if you just believe.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.767
All you have to do is believe.

03:09.233 --> 03:14.266
Oh, I do believe. I do believe in sluts.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.633
Ma, what's wrong?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.500
Leap year... full moon...

03:22.100 --> 03:23.867
Oh, my God. The curse.

03:23.934 --> 03:29.133
It's the nineties. You can call it
what it is, our monthly visitor.

03:30.734 --> 03:33.433
No, the curse of the <i>strega...</i>

03:33.500 --> 03:36.600
It was a curse laid on you
by Lena Pascerelli, our village witch.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.200
What village? I was born in Brooklyn.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.433
Here's a news flash. Witches can fly.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.266
Why did she curse me?

03:45.333 --> 03:48.367
Maybe because you gave her the cold that
eventually killed her.

03:50.333 --> 03:54.033
The point is, on her deathbed,
she laid a curse on you.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.033
"Beware the leap year's full moon."

03:57.100 --> 04:00.600
-That's it? That's the curse?
-What did you expect, poetry?

04:02.166 --> 04:04.567
The woman was on her deathbed.
Give her a break.

04:05.233 --> 04:09.467
So now there are three tasks I must
perform before tomorrow's moonrise...

04:10.033 --> 04:12.033
or you are doomed.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.300
And the three tasks are...

04:14.367 --> 04:17.700
Kiss a fool, help a holy man...

04:18.367 --> 04:20.433
reveal betrayal of a loved one.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.500
Oh, come on, Ma.
That's superstitious nonsense.

04:23.567 --> 04:28.000
Step on a crack, break your mother's back.
It doesn't work. I know.

04:35.834 --> 04:36.967
I tried.

04:38.333 --> 04:43.667
(serene music playing)

04:45.600 --> 04:48.734
Dorothy, do you think this necklace
complements my bosom?

04:50.400 --> 04:53.667
If that necklace could cheer,
I'm sure it would.

04:53.734 --> 04:54.734
Oh!

04:55.433 --> 04:58.166
Well, you know this necklace
is a priceless heirloom.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.767
It belonged to my Grammy.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.767
I've only worn it three times in my life,

05:02.834 --> 05:06.834
and each occasion marked the beginning
of a passionate romance.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.333
And tonight I've decided to wear it
with clothes.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.433
Girls, I did it again!
I won another giveaway!

05:17.500 --> 05:20.500
What did you win this time,
a vasectomy?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.000
Even better. Wait till you hear.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.433
I won an all-expenses-paid
honeymoon trip to Paris, France!

05:29.500 --> 05:32.967
-Oh, my God, Rose Nylund.
-Yes?

05:33.033 --> 05:35.467
-Does this mean you and Miles...
-Yes?

05:35.533 --> 05:38.800
-Are getting married?
-No!

05:40.400 --> 05:44.000
Then what in hell do you want
an all-expenses-paid honeymoon for?

05:44.333 --> 05:47.667
Oh, I don't enter these for the prizes.

05:47.734 --> 05:50.000
I do it for the thrill of winning.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.166
The rush of adrenaline when you realize
that you've grappled Madame chance,

05:56.233 --> 05:59.767
and flung her bloodied
and beaten to the mat.

06:01.934 --> 06:03.567
And just when you think she's dead,

06:03.633 --> 06:05.166
she gets up again
and you have to give her

06:05.233 --> 06:07.333
one of those Van Damme
moves to the jaw--

06:07.400 --> 06:11.166
-Rose.
-I like to win, all right?

06:11.233 --> 06:14.633
Now that you have,
what will you do with the prize?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.633
It's for newlyweds only,

06:16.700 --> 06:19.967
and Miles and I aren't married,
so I'll give it back.

06:20.033 --> 06:23.367
Rose, has it ever occurred to you
that maybe the good lord

06:23.433 --> 06:27.300
is trying to tell you something
with this honeymoon package?

06:27.900 --> 06:29.133
Maybe he is.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.600
Just maybe he is.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
But what?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.266
He's telling you it's time for you
to marry Miles.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.367
Rose, maybe it is a sign.

06:45.433 --> 06:48.533
You and Miles have been
together quite a while.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.000
I appreciate everybody's advice,

06:51.066 --> 06:54.133
but this isn't the way
it's supposed to be.

06:54.834 --> 06:59.100
I'm not going to let some contest dictate
what could be and should be

06:59.166 --> 07:01.433
the most important decision of my life.

07:01.767 --> 07:03.800
I'm much too smart for that.

07:04.266 --> 07:05.533
Good for you, Rose.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.600
I think I'll just go to my room, take two
aspirin, turn out the lights, and...

07:11.633 --> 07:13.033
wait for the voices.

07:17.300 --> 07:22.467
(calm music playing)

07:34.467 --> 07:35.967
Ahem.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.834
Blanche has entered the room.

07:43.367 --> 07:44.467
Ha ha.

07:48.266 --> 07:50.300
Dorothy. Dorothy, come here a minute.

07:50.367 --> 07:52.600
Something strange is going on here.

07:52.667 --> 07:56.033
Would you get up and go somewhere else,
please?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.300
Go, go somewhere.

07:57.767 --> 08:00.600
I don't understand this.
These men are acting crazy.

08:00.667 --> 08:04.767
Yeah. I haven't been hit on like this
since I stopped hanging out

08:04.834 --> 08:07.100
at the midnight show
of <i>Harold and Maude.</i>

08:09.333 --> 08:12.000
You mean men are coming on to you?

08:12.066 --> 08:15.333
One guy said he thought
wrinkles were sexy.

08:15.667 --> 08:16.867
I took him to the garage

08:16.934 --> 08:18.834
where he could see me
under the fluorescents.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.433
This full moon is making people crazy.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.967
I don't mean to pooh-pooh
your whole moon thing,

08:27.033 --> 08:28.500
but pooh-pooh.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.567
No, there really is
something going on here.

08:32.633 --> 08:35.400
Just look how the men
are all flocking around you

08:35.467 --> 08:39.233
and totally ignoring me.
It's... it's nature gone loco.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.500
That's not so ridiculous.
Dorothy has her own allure.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.200
She's confident.

08:45.266 --> 08:47.467
Men are attracted to a confident woman.

08:47.967 --> 08:50.233
Oh, God. I can never
keep a straight face.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.233
Sophia,
this is serious.

08:57.934 --> 09:01.200
Tonight is supposed to be one of the most
romantic nights of my life.

09:01.266 --> 09:02.667
You think you've got problems?

09:02.734 --> 09:05.333
I have to kiss a fool
to save Dorothy from the curse.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.066
Why don't you just kiss Rose
and get it over with?

09:09.734 --> 09:12.834
Technically, Rose isn't a fool.
She's a simpleton.

09:13.934 --> 09:16.333
-What's the difference?
-How can I explain it?

09:16.700 --> 09:18.266
Fools read <i>Dear Abby.</i>

09:18.333 --> 09:21.700
Simpletons read <i>Ann Landers.</i>
It's a fine line.

09:22.934 --> 09:24.734
Actually, I'm very tired.

09:25.367 --> 09:28.667
I dreamed all last night
that I was a car muffler...

09:28.967 --> 09:32.000
and when I woke up this morning,
I was exhausted.

09:36.233 --> 09:38.367
That's brilliant. How do you come up
with these?

09:38.700 --> 09:43.300
I learned most of them as a child,
but they're still relevant today.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.967
Oh, here's Miles. Excuse me.
Hello, honey.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.233
-Come on out here where we can talk.
-Oh. Ok.

09:52.734 --> 09:55.233
Excuse me. Who's Miles?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.633
-Her boyfriend.
-She has a boyfriend?

09:57.900 --> 10:01.700
Shoot. Every time I meet a smart girl,
she's already taken.

10:02.533 --> 10:05.400
Wait a minute.
You think she's smart?

10:05.467 --> 10:07.433
-Well, yeah.
-Hot damn!

10:13.767 --> 10:15.667
(doorbell rings)

10:16.767 --> 10:18.233
Hi, Blanche.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.367
I was sitting home
feeling sorry for myself,

10:20.433 --> 10:23.700
so I thought I'd do some risk-taking
and invite myself over.

10:24.033 --> 10:30.867
Here I am, totally vulnerable,
taking a chance. I am so proud of me.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.166
(doorbell rings)

10:38.967 --> 10:42.000
You know, that would have
devastated the old me...

10:42.867 --> 10:45.800
but the new me?
Just an emotional owie.

10:45.867 --> 10:49.033
And do you know why?
Because I like myself.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.734
(doorbell rings)

10:55.166 --> 10:57.867
The new me is starting
to get honked off.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.266
I'm lonely and scared.
You're having a party.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.066
-Can I come in or not?
-Carol, I'm going to be honest.

11:04.133 --> 11:06.333
I took great pains with this guest list,

11:06.400 --> 11:10.200
and there's room here for only one young,
attractive female.

11:10.266 --> 11:12.066
Ooh, then I just got in under the wire.

11:13.166 --> 11:20.066
(serene music playing)

11:22.166 --> 11:25.233
Boy, look at that great, shining orb.

11:26.166 --> 11:29.934
It's hard to believe it's been hanging
there for millions of years.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.333
Long before man even came to be.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.467
Controls the tides, affects the weather.

11:36.467 --> 11:39.367
Without the moon the earth
would be a barren, stagnant,

11:39.433 --> 11:41.734
uninhabitable planet, Rose.

11:42.133 --> 11:45.367
It gives life, Rose.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.333
It's a big rock, you know?

11:50.100 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, I suppose it is. Full moon, Rose.

11:55.633 --> 11:57.300
Makes me feel frisky,

11:57.367 --> 12:00.800
makes me want to do something
I've never done before.

12:00.867 --> 12:01.867
Like what?

12:02.934 --> 12:07.633
Awoo!

12:07.700 --> 12:09.867
-Come on. You do it, too.
-Well...

12:09.934 --> 12:11.166
Come on.

12:11.734 --> 12:15.433
Awoo!

12:15.867 --> 12:18.767
You see?
You don't need money to have fun.

12:18.834 --> 12:21.967
Oh, I love you, Miles.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.100
I love you, too, Rose.

12:25.500 --> 12:31.967
Miles, have you ever thought about us
getting married?

12:33.300 --> 12:35.433
Uh, well, well, sure.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.867
Eventually, as soon as I put
a little money away.

12:39.667 --> 12:43.066
What, you think I'm being cheap again,
huh?

12:44.166 --> 12:45.266
I'm not, Rose.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.333
I just want to do things right.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.300
You know, a nice honeymoon is expensive.

12:50.367 --> 12:53.367
You know where I want to go? Paris.

12:53.433 --> 12:57.767
Rose, you know what round-trip bus tickets
to Paris, Texas, cost?

12:58.767 --> 13:02.400
-I mean Paris, France.
-France?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.300
Rose, you don't want to go to France.

13:06.367 --> 13:10.967
It's got all that rich food,
pigeons everywhere, that corny music.

13:11.033 --> 13:14.300
No, listen to me.
See America first.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.767
I'm sorry you feel that way...

13:18.734 --> 13:20.867
because I just won a contest...

13:21.233 --> 13:25.934
and the prize was a honeymoon trip
to Paris worth $15,000.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.266
15 thou-- <i>Vive la France! </i>Ooh la la!

13:30.333 --> 13:33.734
-Hey, we're going to paree!
-What?

13:34.300 --> 13:37.233
We were just talking about getting
married.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.834
If we do it now, we can go to Paris,
France,

13:39.900 --> 13:43.500
and use that money for bus tickets
to eat out.

13:44.133 --> 13:48.166
-Oh, they pay for everything.
-What a prize!

13:48.233 --> 13:52.367
-Hey, let's go for it, Rose!
-Wait... wait a minute.

13:52.433 --> 13:57.600
Uh... we're not just getting married
because of the contest, are we?

13:57.667 --> 13:59.867
Oh, no. Oh, sweetheart, no.

13:59.934 --> 14:03.133
I... I'm marrying you
because I love you.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.900
I mean, the prize is just the biggest,
best Christmas present I ever got.

14:08.734 --> 14:11.834
Well, ok, let's do it.
Let's get married.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.900
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.300
Call me old-fashioned,
but if we got a proposal here,

14:17.367 --> 14:18.900
let's do it right.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.667
Oh, of course.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.734
Miles...

14:25.834 --> 14:27.233
if you'd marry me,

14:27.300 --> 14:29.934
you'd make me the happiest woman
in the world.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.166
I think I'm going to cry.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.934
Oh, no, honey.
Don't do that.

14:38.934 --> 14:43.667
(calm music playing)

14:43.734 --> 14:46.633
Last night, I dreamt
I ate a giant marshmallow,

14:46.700 --> 14:48.900
and when I woke up,
my boyfriend was gone.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.834
-I don't get it.
-It's not a joke.

14:57.533 --> 15:02.233
Blanche, I take back everything I said
about your moon theory.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.333
These men are relentless.

15:04.633 --> 15:07.633
I feel like I need a spatula
to keep them off me.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.567
Good thing I don't have one.

15:11.233 --> 15:12.367
Oh, shut up.

15:13.367 --> 15:15.367
Blanche, whatever is the matter?

15:15.433 --> 15:18.633
You know very well what the matter is,
Dorothy.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.734
This stupid moon has
all the men acting crazy.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.700
-Nobody wants me. It's freaky.
-Really?

15:24.767 --> 15:27.100
I haven't noticed anything unusual.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.100
Hmm.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.667
Oh, you filthy pig.

15:40.967 --> 15:45.200
Ok, I admit the dirty note was
a little unusual.

15:46.133 --> 15:49.600
Everyone, may we have your attention?
We have an announcement.

15:50.066 --> 15:51.834
We're taking the prize.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.467
You mean we're getting married.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.533
Oh, that's right.
We're getting married...

15:56.700 --> 15:58.533
and we're taking the prize.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.633
Oh, Rose. Rose.

16:00.700 --> 16:06.433
Oh, this is just crazy and wonderful
and calls for a toast.

16:07.333 --> 16:12.567
To Miles and Rose and poor, lonely
Blanche.

16:14.834 --> 16:17.033
I am so excited.

16:17.100 --> 16:20.600
I am going to have an old-fashioned
St. Olaf wedding.

16:21.266 --> 16:24.033
Dorothy, you're my best friend.
Will you be my maid of honor?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.367
Rose, I...

16:25.433 --> 16:30.567
wait. I won't have to wear horns
or one of those metal brassieres, will I?

16:31.033 --> 16:34.934
Oh, no, Dorothy.
I'm the one that's getting married.

16:36.033 --> 16:39.767
-Then I'd love to.
-A blessing for the couple.

16:40.233 --> 16:44.266
You invited a rabbi
to a moonlight madness party?

16:44.734 --> 16:46.800
May God bless and-- oy!

16:48.533 --> 16:50.734
Oh, look.
A holy man in need of help.

16:54.166 --> 16:56.233
Let me help you, o holy man.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.166
(serene music playing)

17:05.533 --> 17:09.533
Blanche, I've kissed a fool.
I've helped a holy man.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.333
I need the betrayal of a loved one.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.667
What's the worst thing
you've done to Dorothy?

17:14.734 --> 17:17.800
When she moved in here, I told her
there'd be plenty of room for you.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.367
I'll keep looking.

17:21.100 --> 17:24.900
Blanche, I'm going to leave.
I'm not having such a good time.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.300
What a relief to know it isn't just me.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.300
Every man here just wants
to sleep with me...

17:32.100 --> 17:34.233
even the rabbi with the limp.

17:35.834 --> 17:40.500
I'll go jump into a hot tub
and pop open a vein.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.300
Barbara. You've always
been like a daughter to me, Barbara.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.600
I'm carol.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.233
Oh, yeah. The whiny one.

17:51.734 --> 17:54.734
Barbara's your sister.
Sisters don't always get along.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.200
Tell me about it.

17:56.266 --> 17:58.667
How do you deal with that feeling
of betrayal?

17:59.066 --> 18:00.066
Betrayal? For what?

18:00.433 --> 18:03.367
-For what? For that thing.
-What thing?

18:03.934 --> 18:06.800
-The thing that made you feel betrayed.
-Barbara did that?

18:06.867 --> 18:09.333
-She laughed about it.
-She did?

18:09.400 --> 18:13.133
You must get revenge.
Go, betray your sister.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.633
You're right!
I'll get her! I'll get her good!

18:17.367 --> 18:20.200
Wait! I have to know
what you're going to do!

18:20.266 --> 18:23.300
Oh, damn.
Another senseless accident.

18:25.133 --> 18:26.467
(British accent)
Excuse me, miss...

18:26.967 --> 18:30.000
but do you know how
smashingly lovely your eyes are?

18:30.066 --> 18:31.400
Oh, please.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.467
I'll bet you talked to Dorothy

18:33.533 --> 18:36.667
and she sent you out
on this mission of mercy.

18:36.734 --> 18:39.200
Just take a hike, tea bag.

18:39.667 --> 18:43.300
I beg your pardon.
I don't know who this Dorothy is.

18:43.367 --> 18:46.834
I don't know any of the women here.
I like that in a man.

18:47.967 --> 18:50.967
Well, I'm Blanche, and I have lovely eyes.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.433
I'm Derek, and the pleasure is mine.

18:53.900 --> 18:58.700
Before we go any further,
there's something I have to know.

18:58.767 --> 18:59.767
Yes?

19:00.233 --> 19:03.266
Are the English really as bad in bed
as they say?

19:04.533 --> 19:06.800
Well, we're not insatiable
like the Germans,

19:06.867 --> 19:08.333
if that's what you mean...

19:08.900 --> 19:12.433
-but we do have compensating qualities.
-Such as?

19:12.500 --> 19:15.667
We're not the French...
bloody frogs, terrible people.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.633
Coming through.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.166
Sophia, I think I've found him,
my moonlight romance.

19:22.233 --> 19:24.900
Wait a minute.
You're not going to use Blanche

19:24.967 --> 19:26.900
for your own depraved pleasures

19:26.967 --> 19:30.533
and then cast her aside
like yesterday's garbage?

19:30.600 --> 19:31.934
Certainly not.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.266
You sure?
Because it would really help me out.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.734
(calm music playing)

19:43.633 --> 19:46.000
Oh, sorry, Miles.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

19:46.066 --> 19:47.533
That's quite all right.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.934
I had to get away from all those men
all demanding my attention.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.333
-I understand.
-Oh, all those guys,

19:55.400 --> 19:58.200
they're just hanging on my every word.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.300
-That must be annoying.
-Not really.

20:02.433 --> 20:03.967
Where's Rose?

20:04.300 --> 20:05.500
I don't know.

20:05.567 --> 20:07.300
Dorothy, am I doing the right thing?

20:07.967 --> 20:10.867
I'm going to marry Rose.
I don't know if I can live with her.

20:10.934 --> 20:13.600
What if she leaves
every light on at night

20:13.667 --> 20:17.433
or lets the faucet drip all night long

20:17.500 --> 20:20.000
or just stands there
and stares into the refrigerator,

20:20.066 --> 20:21.734
just stares?

20:22.066 --> 20:23.633
Oh, Dorothy, my God.

20:24.633 --> 20:27.033
Miles, I don't know what
you're so worried about.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.367
Rose is a wonderful woman.
She's so loving and caring.

20:31.433 --> 20:35.000
So she's not perfect.
So she has a few faults.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.066
-Like what?
-She's maddening.

20:38.467 --> 20:41.867
St. Olaf stories, sock puppets...

20:42.967 --> 20:44.800
and she's so cheerful in the morning

20:44.867 --> 20:48.600
that you just want to take your grapefruit
and shove it in her face...

20:49.734 --> 20:51.000
hard...

20:52.300 --> 20:54.767
as hard as she can stand it.

20:56.333 --> 20:59.967
Boy, I'd like to see who was runner-up
for maid of honor.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.633
The point is, you two will be
very happy together.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.800
-You don't think we're being crazy?
-Of course.

21:10.867 --> 21:14.533
You're crazy and wonderful,
the way you should be.

21:14.834 --> 21:18.367
Like Puck says in <i>A Midsummer Night's</i>
<i>Dream,</i> when it comes to love...

21:19.033 --> 21:22.400
"Lord, what fools these mortals be."

21:22.467 --> 21:25.400
-Oh, Dorothy.
-What?

21:25.834 --> 21:29.867
I thought I was the only one who quoted
Shakespeare in a normal conversation.

21:29.934 --> 21:32.233
-Really?
-You know, Dorothy, it's funny.

21:32.667 --> 21:36.266
A casual observer would say
we're the ones who should be together.

21:36.767 --> 21:39.166
We share the same interests.
We're in the same field.

21:39.233 --> 21:41.066
We're both attractive.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.567
The evening isn't over yet.

21:45.467 --> 21:48.166
Maybe my prince charming
will get moonstruck

21:48.233 --> 21:51.133
and sweep me away the way you did Rose.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.533
I hope so, Dorothy. You deserve it.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.367
I want to thank you for being a good
friend and a good person.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.734
You are very, very welcome.

22:03.233 --> 22:05.166
-I do love her.
-I know.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.433
Oh!

22:13.900 --> 22:15.867
Hello, Judas.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.667
(theme music playing)
