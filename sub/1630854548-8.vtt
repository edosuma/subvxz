[Rita] Are we sure
we're sober enough
to lead the way?

02:41.378 --> 02:44.314
Oh, I don't know,
I think so.

02:44.314 --> 02:48.385
A pile of dead corpses
in a giant crater
is fairly sobering.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.955
That said...

02:50.955 --> 02:54.219
I do think there's something
very familiar about Immortus.

02:54.219 --> 02:57.427
But I just can't place it.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.030
Well, that's because
it's not Immortus,

03:00.030 --> 03:02.432
it's Isabel fucking Feathers!

03:02.432 --> 03:04.868
[Cliff] Shit.
Is it Immortus or isn't it?

03:05.568 --> 03:07.004
The fuck do you care?

03:08.205 --> 03:09.306
[Cliff] Immortus!

03:09.306 --> 03:11.341
[whisper shouting] Immortus!

03:11.341 --> 03:13.510
- [fake cough] Immortus!
- Will you shut up?

03:13.510 --> 03:15.779
Nobody thinks it's funny.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.182
It's your fault why
we're in this fucking mess.

03:18.182 --> 03:20.617
Come on,
it's not all my fault, right?

03:20.617 --> 03:23.453
It's a little bit
Larry's fault too.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.124
Dorothy?

03:27.124 --> 03:28.658
Where'd you come from?

03:28.658 --> 03:30.860
And who's the chick
in the jumpsuit?

03:30.860 --> 03:32.696
Cliff, not now, Please.

03:32.696 --> 03:33.863
Casey.

03:34.998 --> 03:36.000
You okay?

03:37.167 --> 03:40.265
My father is... dead.

03:40.265 --> 03:44.641
Some part of me always knew
his story would end like this.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.977
But that other man,
Wally Sage?

03:48.211 --> 03:50.780
He was my creator. And...

03:50.780 --> 03:52.916
the only one
who could explain why I'm here.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.586
To lose them both...

03:56.586 --> 03:58.688
I don't know why
you're here, Casey.

04:00.423 --> 04:01.891
But I'm glad you are.

04:05.562 --> 04:08.765
We'll figure this out together.
I promise.

04:10.768 --> 04:12.836
[sighs]

04:12.836 --> 04:14.738
Hey, should I be
worried about this?

04:16.072 --> 04:17.907
Honestly? I don't know.

04:17.907 --> 04:20.077
Can't really say
I saw this one coming.

04:22.879 --> 04:24.982
Yeah, I gotta get
the hell out of here.

04:24.982 --> 04:27.151
Are you calling an Uber?

04:27.151 --> 04:31.956
Bro, we just blew up
a pocket dimension
in the middle of Ohio.

04:31.956 --> 04:34.358
I gotta go check
on my wife and kids.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.559
- [laughs]
- Come on, man.

04:35.559 --> 04:37.061
A'ight, you go be a dad.

04:38.595 --> 04:40.998
[laughs] I'll handle this.

04:44.434 --> 04:45.970
You really do love it,
don't you?

04:48.304 --> 04:50.335
- How's that?
- You know.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.476
This.

04:53.743 --> 04:55.445
Man, you looked like
your old self back there.

04:55.445 --> 04:58.115
Those freaky ass
Scissormen couldn't wipe
the grin off your face.

04:58.115 --> 04:59.783
Hey, by this
you're talking about
me being Cyborg--

04:59.783 --> 05:02.919
No, no. Nah.
You were right about that.

05:02.919 --> 05:05.055
You can't just go back
to being Cyborg.

05:08.091 --> 05:09.393
At least...

05:11.161 --> 05:13.097
not the old Cyborg.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.664
[cell phone chimes]

05:17.100 --> 05:18.468
That's my ride.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.438
[grunts]

05:24.673 --> 05:26.476
- Get home safe.
- All right.

05:28.511 --> 05:29.779
I'll talk to you.

05:32.916 --> 05:33.917
Come on.

05:38.788 --> 05:40.090
[panting]

05:41.624 --> 05:43.293
So, what's the verdict?

05:43.293 --> 05:46.530
Should one of us
go check on her,
ask if she's doing all right?

05:46.530 --> 05:48.698
Ask if she's doing all right?

05:48.698 --> 05:51.501
She just exploded
and killed
half a dozen people!

05:51.501 --> 05:54.704
She needs to
be destroyed.

05:54.704 --> 05:57.074
Wow, that is big talk

05:57.074 --> 06:00.744
for someone
who couldn't even handle
killing a fake Wally Sage.

06:00.744 --> 06:02.812
Maybe there's
somewhere between,

06:02.812 --> 06:05.682
you know, hospitality
and homicide?

06:05.682 --> 06:06.984
- Homicide?
- Yeah.

06:06.984 --> 06:09.119
I don't want to murder
some random girl!

06:09.119 --> 06:12.089
[Cliff] Or get murdered
by some random girl.

06:12.089 --> 06:14.191
[Larry]
What if we're following
the wrong girl?

06:14.191 --> 06:16.360
Are we sure that's Immortus?

06:16.360 --> 06:18.128
[Cliff] Immortus?

06:18.128 --> 06:19.529
[in high pitch] Immortus?

06:19.529 --> 06:20.830
[in accent] Immortus?

06:20.830 --> 06:22.932
[Rita] Oh, for fuck's sake.
Isabel?

06:22.932 --> 06:24.768
Isabel Feathers?

06:25.930 --> 06:26.803
Yeah?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.973
Prepare yourself,
Isabel Feathers.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.742
Did ya'll just say
"Isabel Feathers"?

06:35.579 --> 06:36.713
[sighs]

06:36.713 --> 06:40.017
You found Isabel Feathers!
[laughs]

06:41.585 --> 06:43.087
[jingle playing]

06:46.223 --> 06:48.192
<i>After several months,</i>

06:48.192 --> 06:51.795
<i>the body of Isabel Feathers
has been found,
and that body is alive.</i>

06:52.961 --> 06:55.699
<i>So, Isabel,
we're dying to know.</i>

06:55.699 --> 06:58.102
<i>Where have you been
all this time?</i>

06:58.102 --> 06:59.736
<i>Where have I been?</i>

07:01.570 --> 07:06.543
<i>I guess you could say
I was lost in
the fabric of reality.</i>

07:06.543 --> 07:09.313
<i>Somewhere outside
of space and time.</i>

07:09.313 --> 07:12.916
[Jonathan]
<i>Outside of space and time.
I see.</i>

07:12.916 --> 07:16.481
And what was that
like for you?

07:16.481 --> 07:21.325
There are no words...
[distorted] to accurately
describe my experience.

07:21.325 --> 07:24.894
I witnessed
the rise and fall
of civilizations.

07:24.894 --> 07:27.297
<i>I stared into the heat death
of the universe</i>

07:27.297 --> 07:30.067
<i>and heard the answer
to the final question.</i>

07:30.067 --> 07:32.970
<i>My body was everywhere
and nowhere all at once,</i>

07:32.970 --> 07:35.672
<i>and my screams echoed
back to me through the eons</i>

07:35.672 --> 07:38.075
<i>like a chorus
of haunted memories.</i>

07:38.075 --> 07:43.847
<i>The only escape was death,
and death was revealed to be
nothing but an illusion.</i>

07:46.248 --> 07:49.653
[Cliff] This is what
we do now that
we're old and decrepit?

07:49.653 --> 07:52.256
Watch supervillains
on television?

07:52.256 --> 07:55.059
This girl looks like
she's definitely
about to explode again.

07:55.059 --> 07:58.062
[Rita] We should've
taken her out
when we had the chance.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.464
Uh... [sighs]

08:00.464 --> 08:04.301
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know
why I said that. I...</i>

08:06.602 --> 08:09.506
<i>So, Isabel,
we're dying to know,</i>

08:09.506 --> 08:11.641
<i>where have you been
all this time?</i>

08:11.641 --> 08:14.111
Okay, what the fuck was that?

08:14.111 --> 08:15.812
Oh my gosh, Jonathan.

08:15.812 --> 08:20.117
I honestly can't explain
the wheres and hows
of what happened to me.

08:20.117 --> 08:23.548
It was just, like,
so deep, you know?

08:23.548 --> 08:25.322
What I can say

08:25.322 --> 08:28.725
<i>is I really used that time
to work on myself.</i>

08:28.725 --> 08:30.494
<i>My brand. You know?</i>

08:30.494 --> 08:34.831
<i>I stopped asking
"Where is Isabel Feathers?"</i>

08:34.831 --> 08:38.902
<i>and started asking,
"Who is Isabel Feathers?"</i>

08:38.902 --> 08:42.006
[Cliff] This is what we do now
that we're old and decrepit?

08:42.006 --> 08:45.175
Watch supervillains
on television?

08:45.175 --> 08:47.677
[Jane] Maybe that explosion
was a one-time deal. I mean,

08:47.677 --> 08:51.848
this theater geek
doesn't seem like
the vengeful time-god type.

08:51.848 --> 08:54.284
Uh-huh, did no one
else see that?

08:54.284 --> 08:59.656
I saw enough. Isabel,
Immortus, is a threat
that needs to be removed.

09:01.491 --> 09:05.495
Oh please. We all know
what Immortus is capable of.

09:05.495 --> 09:08.698
Also, she's not just Immortus.

09:08.698 --> 09:10.667
She's my former archenemy...

09:10.667 --> 09:12.002
Thespian archenemy.

09:12.002 --> 09:16.140
Isabel Feathers
is no thespian, Jane.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.075
She's a two-faced,

09:18.075 --> 09:23.981
mm, dinner-theater caliber
pretty-faced witch who
might just be a world killer.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.983
- We need to destroy her.
- Rita's right.

09:25.983 --> 09:30.154
You know, I got a strange
sense of deja vu when I was
watching that interview.

09:30.154 --> 09:33.557
One minute, like,
she was kinda dangerous
and kind of weird

09:33.557 --> 09:38.495
and then the next minute,
she was just this
normal ordinary girl.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.266
[Larry] Maybe she's dangerous
and normal, like us.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.201
We should leave her alone.

09:44.201 --> 09:46.736
[Cliff] Please, please,
please, please...

09:50.138 --> 09:53.638
[gasps] No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

09:53.638 --> 09:58.949
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck!

09:59.749 --> 10:01.518
Cliff?

10:01.518 --> 10:04.321
Oh, my God. What do we do?
What do we do?
[breathing heavily]

10:08.152 --> 10:10.360
What?

10:10.360 --> 10:15.365
Um, I was just checking
to see if anybody wanted
to have ice cream.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.534
- Why would anyone want
ice cream right now?
- Nobody wants ice cream.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.470
- I feel like a soft serve or...
- Get a hold of yourself, man.

10:20.470 --> 10:24.874
All right, fuck off.
You guys can't keep
giving me shit for this.

10:24.874 --> 10:29.579
I didn't lose our longevity.
We all lost
our longevity together.

10:29.579 --> 10:31.381
- Don't even fucking
start with me.
- This is 100% your fault.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.350
- This is not a good look.
- [Madame Rouge] I agree.

10:33.350 --> 10:35.252
This is why we need to act.

10:35.252 --> 10:39.556
We need to figure out
exactly what is going on
with Isabel, Immortus.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.392
It's our best chance at

10:42.392 --> 10:46.096
getting out of this mess
that Cliff has gotten us into.

10:46.096 --> 10:48.298
[Cliff] You're kidding me?

10:48.298 --> 10:50.900
[Jonathan] <i>So, Isabel,
are you excited about
the big rescue celebration</i>

10:50.900 --> 10:52.669
<i>going on this afternoon?</i>

10:52.669 --> 10:55.239
<i>And do you expect that some
of the heroes that saved you</i>

10:55.239 --> 10:57.702
<i>will make an appearance
in the parade?</i>

10:57.702 --> 11:02.146
<i>Uh, I'm sure they'll be there.</i>

11:02.146 --> 11:05.382
<i>They're just as happy
I'm back as...</i>

11:05.382 --> 11:07.417
<i>everyone else is, right?</i>

11:07.417 --> 11:11.255
[Jonathan]
<i>Well, why in the</i> World of Wut
<i>would they not be, right?</i>

11:11.255 --> 11:12.856
[both laughing]

11:12.856 --> 11:15.059
That's it! Hm?

11:15.059 --> 11:20.530
That's the cover we need
to go into town and figure out
what's really going on here.

11:20.530 --> 11:22.099
We've practically been invited.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.001
I'm right here!
Stop shouting!

11:27.737 --> 11:30.407
Sorry. I thought
I heard something.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.576
You okay?

11:32.576 --> 11:37.247
I don't know, Dr. Stone.
You try aging 15 years
in an afternoon.

11:37.247 --> 11:42.086
[Cliff] I'm with Jane.
We're literally
getting too old for this.

11:43.486 --> 11:46.023
[Larry] Face it, Rita.
It's over. We lost.

11:46.023 --> 11:48.725
Immortus was just a bunch
of comic book bullshit.

11:48.725 --> 11:52.262
It doesn't really matter to me
whether Isabel
is an ordinary girl

11:52.262 --> 11:54.664
or an ordinary despotic
time monster.

11:54.664 --> 11:58.568
I have to figure out
what to do with
the little time I have left.

11:58.568 --> 12:00.604
Perhaps you're right.

12:00.604 --> 12:03.507
We are all getting older.

12:03.507 --> 12:09.679
Even though I am the one
who has aged
more than anyone else,

12:09.679 --> 12:14.551
and I am still ready
to kick some ass.

12:14.551 --> 12:17.821
Uh, right, let's get to work.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.823
[Dorothy] Okay, so this...

12:21.191 --> 12:24.461
is my father's spaceship.

12:24.461 --> 12:27.897
Whoa, holy smokes, kid,
a spaceship?

12:27.897 --> 12:30.900
It looks, uh,
super aerodynamic.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.104
[clanging]

12:34.104 --> 12:37.041
So, uh, what kind of engine
you workin' with here, huh?

12:37.041 --> 12:40.244
Dutonium fire-water?
Combustible neutron droplets?

12:40.844 --> 12:42.046
Purple Crystals?

12:42.046 --> 12:43.747
It runs on apples.

12:43.747 --> 12:47.217
You feed them
to a mountain goat
over the dashboard.

12:47.217 --> 12:48.418
Huh.

12:54.790 --> 12:57.361
How are you feeling, Casey?

12:58.962 --> 13:00.330
Okie-dokie.

13:01.899 --> 13:03.367
I don't know-kie.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.575
Out of all the real life

13:11.575 --> 13:15.112
feelings I've experienced
for the first time, this is...

13:16.112 --> 13:18.715
really the worst,
you know.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.886
No one likes
to feel that pain.

13:22.886 --> 13:26.523
Sometimes it stays
with you forever.

13:26.523 --> 13:28.959
But grief is like a gift.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.828
Just like smell and taste.

13:31.828 --> 13:35.465
All of these things
let you know
that you're alive.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.235
That you're real.

13:39.769 --> 13:43.040
[sniffles] I just wish
I could turn the page.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.010
But that's why
I brought you here.

13:46.010 --> 13:49.246
[sighs] I want you to
have my father's ship.

13:49.246 --> 13:53.517
You can go anywhere
you want to.

13:53.517 --> 13:58.883
I don't know. I've never
been driven by goat-apple
power before, so...

14:01.158 --> 14:02.292
[Casey sighs]

14:04.761 --> 14:06.163
[exhales]

14:09.265 --> 14:10.895
I think I need
a new mission.

14:10.895 --> 14:12.402
A mission?

14:14.037 --> 14:15.505
Here on Earth?

14:18.474 --> 14:21.778
Well, I guess I have
a mission of my own right now.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.580
These people here,

14:23.580 --> 14:28.252
they're family to me.
They're the only family
I have left,

14:28.885 --> 14:30.320
and they're dying.

14:33.389 --> 14:36.460
[sighs] I have
to help them.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.029
[Casey] Well, it sounds
pretty important.

14:39.029 --> 14:41.531
Maybe this time
I'll be your sidekick.

14:42.932 --> 14:45.269
That is
if you'll have me aboard.

14:47.738 --> 14:49.073
[laughing]

14:49.073 --> 14:50.574
[Larry] <i>I'm sorry, pal.</i>

14:51.975 --> 14:54.078
Things didn't go
the way we hoped.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.718
I swear, I'll give you
all I can until
my very last breath.

15:04.187 --> 15:06.223
[Rama] <i>Quite depressing, mate.</i>

15:06.223 --> 15:10.127
<i>Slightly less depressing
than the robot in your garage,
but only slightly.</i>

15:10.761 --> 15:14.031
Rama? Is that you?

15:14.031 --> 15:15.932
I... I thought
you disappeared.

15:15.932 --> 15:20.004
[Rama]
<i>Not so much disappeared.
More of, uh, disassembled.</i>

15:20.004 --> 15:23.273
<i>I think your little
glowing friend
got a little carried away</i>

15:23.273 --> 15:25.075
<i>and, well, obliterated me.</i>

15:25.075 --> 15:28.778
Did you?
Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea.

15:28.778 --> 15:32.416
<i>Think nothing of it.
It's just, I need your help.</i>

15:34.717 --> 15:39.189
Uh, okay, all right.
If I were
a defrosted Zombie Butt,

15:39.189 --> 15:41.025
where the hell would I be?

15:43.660 --> 15:44.694
[groans]

15:45.996 --> 15:48.232
I would be-- [grunts] No.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.271
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.107
Buttpocalypse 2?

16:01.777 --> 16:06.050
Or... maybe
Immortus destroys the world

16:06.050 --> 16:11.388
before the Zombie Butts
destroy the world
and it'll be my little secret.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.124
[laughs]

16:17.626 --> 16:19.329
- [mechanical whirring]
- [coughs] Shut up!

16:19.329 --> 16:21.999
Fucking Parkinson's!

16:21.999 --> 16:25.269
Fucking aging!
Fuck you! [groans]

16:25.269 --> 16:26.536
- Fuck!
- Cliff?

16:26.536 --> 16:28.838
- Huh? Oh! Hey, kid!
- [whirring stops]

16:28.838 --> 16:30.874
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

16:30.874 --> 16:36.480
Totally not reckoning
with my mortality in multiple
very-real scenarios.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.046
- Follow me.
- I'm actually a little busy
but... [groans]

16:42.485 --> 16:44.254
Okay, we're fine.
Where are we going?

16:48.123 --> 16:51.795
[Madame Rouge]
<i>Jane? Jane, where are you?
Jane, where have you gone?</i>

16:51.795 --> 16:54.764
Where the hell am I?
Why can't I find my way
back to my station?

16:54.764 --> 16:57.434
<i>- Where did you go, Jane?</i>
- I can't find you!

16:57.434 --> 17:00.937
- [Rita] <i>Is she coming back?</i>
- I'm lost.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.341
I'm lost
in my own fucking head!
Somebody help me?

17:04.341 --> 17:06.243
Somebody help me, please!

17:06.243 --> 17:07.744
[Casey] <i>I can help you.</i>

17:13.683 --> 17:16.520
Why the fuck
were you in my head?

17:16.520 --> 17:19.256
- I'm not sure
what you mean by that.
- Whatever.

17:20.089 --> 17:21.925
I'm out of here.

17:21.925 --> 17:25.295
Tell the rest
of the Power Rangers
no karate in the house.

17:28.097 --> 17:31.401
- What's the plan, Rita?
- As I've been saying all along,

17:31.401 --> 17:34.099
find Immortus, and do
whatever needs to be done.

17:34.099 --> 17:38.275
If Isabel puts one little
pedicured toe out of line,
she's as good as dead.

17:38.275 --> 17:40.377
Since when did you become
dark and vengeful?

17:40.377 --> 17:43.747
Hm, apparently
it's been a thing
for quite some time now.

17:43.747 --> 17:45.882
I'm sick of good guys
and bad guys.

17:45.882 --> 17:48.918
The Agents of Immortus
were good guys,
and look where it got them.

17:48.918 --> 17:52.957
We will never
get our longevity back
if we ask nicely.

17:52.957 --> 17:55.359
Get your longevity?

17:55.359 --> 17:57.394
Wait, that's what
this whole thing
is really about?

17:57.394 --> 17:59.163
- [Isabel] Oh, thanks.
- There she is.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.765
Thank you so much
for being here,
it's truly an honor.

18:01.765 --> 18:04.934
[gasps] You saw my show?
Oh, I would love
to sign that.

18:04.934 --> 18:10.040
Hi, there, I'm Claire.
Claire Delaire.
The Cloverton Mayor.

18:10.040 --> 18:14.644
Would you happen to be
the Dune Patrol?
Did I say that right?

18:14.644 --> 18:20.384
It's actually the <i>Doom</i> Patrol.
And, yes, I suppose we are.

18:20.384 --> 18:22.119
As I live and breathe.

18:22.119 --> 18:24.354
Everyone, gather round!

18:24.354 --> 18:25.822
- Come, come, come.
- [indistinct chatter]

18:25.822 --> 18:28.192
Wait, what's wrong?
I was, I was...

18:28.192 --> 18:30.760
I was halfway through
the opening
of my autobiography...

18:30.760 --> 18:33.030
[distorted]
<i>"Feathers in the Wind"!</i>

18:33.030 --> 18:34.898
[thunder rumbling]

18:37.100 --> 18:38.702
[gasps]

18:43.506 --> 18:46.143
Oh, of course.
And who should
I make it out to?

18:46.143 --> 18:50.214
Would you happen to be
the Dune Patrol?
Did I say that right?

18:50.214 --> 18:56.120
- Uh, it's actually--
- Everyone!
It's the Doom Patrol!

18:56.120 --> 18:57.154
[chuckling]

18:57.154 --> 18:58.422
[indistinct chatter]

18:58.422 --> 19:03.027
My heroes!
I am so glad you're here!

19:03.027 --> 19:06.863
This is the greatest
Rescue Celebration Day
we've ever had.

19:06.863 --> 19:08.732
[crowd] Yeah.

19:12.067 --> 19:16.406
[Rama] <i>Let's not despair.
There's surely some solution.
There always is.</i>

19:16.406 --> 19:18.708
[Larry] I don't know
if there is a solution.

19:21.043 --> 19:23.680
I made a mess of everything
while you were gone.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.317
<i>- How's that?</i>
- It doesn't matter
how it happened.

19:27.317 --> 19:30.120
The bottom line:
Immortus was a lie.

19:30.120 --> 19:34.191
Everything you told me,
everything you believed,
all of it was a lie.

19:34.191 --> 19:38.262
Now, my longevity is gone
and I'm rapidly aging
to my death.

19:38.262 --> 19:41.631
You know as well as I do
the dangers of aging
to a radioactive being.

19:41.631 --> 19:46.470
If I destabilize as my body
breaks down, I'll become
a geriatric dirty bomb!

19:47.970 --> 19:49.506
Keeg, what the hell
are you doing?

19:49.506 --> 19:51.675
We're not alone in here,
that radiation is deadly.

19:51.675 --> 19:54.078
[Rama] <i>Wait!
Keeg's onto something.</i>

19:54.078 --> 19:57.114
<i>I'm in this mess
because my electrons
have been dispersed.</i>

19:57.114 --> 19:59.116
<i>A healthy dose of radiation
might allow me</i>

19:59.116 --> 20:02.519
<i>to siphon the particles
I need to rehabilitate myself!</i>

20:02.519 --> 20:05.422
- Are you feeling this?
<i>- Yes!</i>

20:09.525 --> 20:11.428
[electricity buzzing]

20:11.428 --> 20:13.998
<i>- Et voila!</i>
- [groaning]

20:13.998 --> 20:15.465
[electricity crackling]

20:15.465 --> 20:17.067
[straining] Come on!
Stay with me!

20:17.067 --> 20:18.935
- Don't let go!
- [both grunting]

20:18.935 --> 20:23.007
- Don't let go!
- I've got you. We've got you!

20:23.007 --> 20:24.508
[both groaning]

20:24.508 --> 20:27.844
[both sigh in relief]

20:27.844 --> 20:30.580
- [both chuckle]
- [breathing heavily]

20:36.886 --> 20:39.356
[breathing heavily]
Great work. Thank you.

20:40.457 --> 20:42.526
[Larry] No problem.

20:42.526 --> 20:45.529
[slow instrumental
music playing]

20:47.930 --> 20:52.336
Hey, have you see anything
weird around here lately?

20:52.336 --> 20:54.371
Like, weirder than normal?

20:54.371 --> 20:57.774
Like, small?
And possibly dangerous?

20:57.774 --> 21:01.445
- No.
- Cool. Cool, me neither.

21:01.445 --> 21:02.980
So, what's the deal, kid?

21:02.980 --> 21:04.982
So, I was thinking about

21:04.982 --> 21:07.184
how you've been having
trouble getting around.

21:07.184 --> 21:11.455
And now that
you're getting older,
I thought...

21:13.789 --> 21:16.293
- You thought?
- Papa's old chair!

21:16.293 --> 21:18.562
- I want you to have it.
- Why?

21:18.562 --> 21:21.431
- Why? To use it.
- Fuck, no.

21:21.431 --> 21:24.501
Sorry. I meant, fuck, no!

21:24.501 --> 21:26.903
I would literally rather die.

21:26.903 --> 21:29.906
What do you mean?
This chair will make your life
so much better.

21:29.906 --> 21:32.009
You think
that'll make my life better?

21:32.009 --> 21:35.412
Did you get the impression
that Niles was thrilled
with his life?

21:35.412 --> 21:37.581
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to upset you.

21:37.581 --> 21:42.819
I see what you're trying to do.
Everyone hated Niles,
and now everyone hates me.

21:42.819 --> 21:45.922
So, what,
I'm supposed to be
the new Niles?

21:45.922 --> 21:48.658
Wheel around
and fuck up everyone's lives?

21:48.658 --> 21:52.729
- No, fucking thank you.
- I know you and Papa
didn't get along...

21:52.729 --> 21:56.266
I hated him in life
and I still hate him in death.

21:56.266 --> 22:01.505
Even when his ghost asked
for my help, I told him
to haunt the fuck right off.

22:01.505 --> 22:03.673
[somber music playing]

22:03.673 --> 22:07.111
You... you spoke
to Papa's ghost?

22:08.311 --> 22:12.182
Er... Uh, yeah, er...

22:12.182 --> 22:14.952
I didn't tell you because...

22:14.952 --> 22:18.855
Well, maybe
you haven't noticed, kid,
but I'm an asshole!

22:18.855 --> 22:22.859
So, stop trying to pity me
and leave me the fuck alone.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.798
[sighs wearily]

22:32.802 --> 22:35.005
What the fuck
are you doing in my room?

22:35.005 --> 22:37.474
Oh! Is this your room?

22:37.474 --> 22:41.078
That... that is so,
uh, unexpected.

22:41.078 --> 22:44.448
I was just... uh...
I was just...

22:45.509 --> 22:49.086
I'm sorry,
I was just trying to help.

22:49.086 --> 22:52.556
And I think I got
a little carried away.

22:52.556 --> 22:55.492
- I love your paintings,
by the way.
- Who are you again?

22:55.492 --> 22:56.926
I'm Space Case.

22:58.394 --> 23:00.830
But my secret identity
is Casey Brinke.

23:00.830 --> 23:03.533
- I guess
it's not really a secret.
- [groans softly]

23:03.533 --> 23:05.702
[groans]
I don't give a shit.

23:07.203 --> 23:10.907
You seemed like
you could use
a hand earlier, so...

23:10.907 --> 23:14.144
I took the liberty
of organizing
this amazing puzzle.

23:15.579 --> 23:17.381
[sniffles]

23:17.381 --> 23:20.650
Who gives a shit
about a fucking puzzle?
[sniffles]

23:20.650 --> 23:22.953
Listen, I used to be
a fictional character

23:22.953 --> 23:25.450
so I'm not always right
about these things.

23:25.450 --> 23:27.024
But I got the sense

23:27.024 --> 23:29.893
that this puzzle had some sort
of emotional significance

23:29.893 --> 23:31.895
- So I figured--
- Are you still talking?

23:31.895 --> 23:36.933
You can't
just come into my room
and expect to fix my life.

23:36.933 --> 23:39.970
My life is fucked up
beyond your understanding.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.472
You're hurting.

23:48.545 --> 23:50.047
I can tell.

23:51.214 --> 23:53.017
But, uh...

23:53.017 --> 23:58.188
these feelings,
they let you know
that you're... alive.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.486
That you're real.

24:01.486 --> 24:04.194
[both laughing]

24:06.161 --> 24:09.599
I don't know where you heard
that fortune cookie garbage,

24:09.599 --> 24:11.935
but they need to get
their facts straight.

24:11.935 --> 24:15.539
I'm not real.
I'm just a construct.

24:15.539 --> 24:18.808
I'm not real,
this puzzle isn't real,
and guess what?

24:18.808 --> 24:20.844
You are not real either.

24:22.512 --> 24:24.681
You said it yourself,
you're fictional.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.617
You're not real.

24:27.617 --> 24:29.653
You're not a superhero.

24:29.653 --> 24:34.024
You're just a nosey girl
who organizes other people's
shit into random piles.

24:36.259 --> 24:37.861
[whimpering]

24:40.062 --> 24:43.700
- I guess I still have
a lot to figure out.
- [sniffling]

24:46.870 --> 24:48.572
I'll leave you alone.

24:54.677 --> 24:58.215
They aren't random piles,
by the way.

24:58.215 --> 25:00.217
They're organized by color.

25:07.456 --> 25:09.026
[jingle playing]

25:14.597 --> 25:18.102
We're back again
with the woman of the hour,
Isabel Feathers.

25:18.102 --> 25:19.636
[Isabel laughs]

25:19.636 --> 25:23.240
And joining her,
is the woman behind
the woman of the hour,

25:23.240 --> 25:24.774
Gertrude Cramp.

25:24.774 --> 25:27.077
Girl power. Am I right, ladies?

25:27.077 --> 25:29.679
- [Isabel giggles]
- [chuckles]

25:29.679 --> 25:32.882
Now, Miss Cramp,
I'm told that you were actually

25:32.882 --> 25:35.185
the understudy
of Isabel Feathers

25:35.185 --> 25:37.582
in a critically acclaimed
production of <i>Our Town.</i>

25:37.582 --> 25:42.159
Well, that's not even
the juiciest part
of the story, Jonathan.

25:42.159 --> 25:45.029
World of Wut <i>would you say
if I told you</i>

25:45.029 --> 25:49.666
<i>that Isabel was playing a role
in</i> Our Town <i>based on me?</i>

25:49.666 --> 25:53.537
It truly was an incredible
performance by me.
[chuckles nervously]

25:53.537 --> 25:58.708
<i>It takes a lot of talent
to portray such
a tragic character.</i>

25:58.708 --> 26:01.211
I'm sure you remember
the day she blobbed out

26:01.211 --> 26:03.813
<i>and nearly destroyed
the entire town.</i>

26:03.813 --> 26:06.716
I think,
it's important to remember

26:06.716 --> 26:13.023
that, at the time,
I was trying very hard
not to destroy the town.

26:13.023 --> 26:14.924
[giggles] <i>I mean sure.</i>

26:14.924 --> 26:17.827
<i>That's what made playing
your character so complicated.</i>

26:17.827 --> 26:19.796
<i>But easy for me.</i>
[chuckling]

26:19.796 --> 26:23.628
And I assume, you have
a background in acting as well,
Miss Cramp?

26:23.628 --> 26:26.303
I dabble. Many have said...

26:26.303 --> 26:30.907
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm telling you,
something is wrong.

26:30.907 --> 26:33.843
[Jonathan] Gertrude,
you are simply amazing!

26:35.078 --> 26:37.214
[distorted]
Consider this a warning!

26:37.214 --> 26:41.051
Tell your friend to back
the fuck out of my moment,

26:41.051 --> 26:43.087
or there will be
nothing left of her

26:43.087 --> 26:48.092
but a pile of acrylic nails
and the smell of vodka.

26:53.257 --> 26:54.831
[tape rewinding]

26:54.831 --> 26:58.663
Well, that's not even
the juiciest part
of the story, Jonathan.

26:58.663 --> 27:00.837
Okay, tell me
you felt something there.

27:01.771 --> 27:02.940
Yeah?

27:02.940 --> 27:05.142
Aside from
the overwhelming boredom?

27:05.142 --> 27:09.179
No. She does not fit
the supervillain profile.

27:09.179 --> 27:11.915
[Jonathan] Now, let's meet
the rest of your team.

27:11.915 --> 27:15.352
Laura De Mille, Victor Stone.

27:15.352 --> 27:17.287
Welcome to <i>World of Wut.</i>

27:17.287 --> 27:21.458
So, Victor,
you are not Cyborg anymore,

27:21.458 --> 27:22.926
what's that like?

27:23.827 --> 27:25.229
Uh...

27:26.529 --> 27:28.365
[metal clangs]

27:28.365 --> 27:29.694
[electronic buzzing]

27:31.068 --> 27:32.569
- [electronic buzz]
- [grunting]

27:32.569 --> 27:33.870
Fuck.

27:34.470 --> 27:37.074
[whirring]

27:39.041 --> 27:41.611
Just so you know,
I'd be having trouble
with these steps

27:41.611 --> 27:44.214
whether
I was in a chair or not.

27:44.214 --> 27:45.215
[metal thud]

27:45.215 --> 27:47.784
Cliff, I'm sorry
if I've upset you.

27:49.185 --> 27:52.256
But you're going to have
to take care of yourself

27:52.256 --> 27:54.891
if you want
to be there for your family.

27:54.891 --> 27:56.793
Be there for my family?

27:56.793 --> 28:00.998
How exactly is
an invalid robot supposed
to be there for his family?

28:00.998 --> 28:04.434
You have to let people
take care of you.

28:04.434 --> 28:08.072
It's not your condition
that's a burden,
it's your obstinance.

28:08.072 --> 28:09.940
Why do you have
to make it so hard?

28:09.940 --> 28:11.736
Because
I can take care of myself.

28:11.736 --> 28:13.677
If you can take care
of yourself, then walk up
the damn steps.

28:13.677 --> 28:16.446
I don't want to.
Maybe I like it here
at the bottom.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.515
Okay, then walk with me
to the elevator.

28:18.515 --> 28:20.650
- No.
- [yelling] Why won't you
let me help you?

28:20.650 --> 28:22.452
[yelling]
Because I don't deserve it!

28:25.088 --> 28:27.091
Trust me, kid,
I don't deserve love.

28:27.091 --> 28:28.959
I don't even deserve pity.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.995
I've been trying so hard
to leave something behind
that's worth a damn,

28:30.995 --> 28:33.163
but I just keep
fucking things up more.

28:33.163 --> 28:36.200
It'll be better for everyone
when I'm dead and gone.

28:39.335 --> 28:42.906
[angrily]
Don't say that, Cliff.

28:42.906 --> 28:45.042
- [metallic thud]
- Don't ever say that.

28:46.509 --> 28:49.446
Your death won't hurt you

28:49.446 --> 28:54.779
nearly as much as
it will hurt the people
who have to live with it.

28:54.779 --> 28:59.056
Do you have any idea
of all the things
I wish I could have said?

28:59.056 --> 29:01.758
All the moments
I wish we could have shared?

29:01.758 --> 29:05.095
And now that you're closer
than you've ever been
to the end,

29:05.095 --> 29:07.131
you just want to waste time?

29:08.532 --> 29:10.067
[exhales]

29:10.067 --> 29:12.970
People love you, Cliff.

29:12.970 --> 29:16.373
- And people want to help you.
- [Cliff sighs]

29:16.373 --> 29:18.108
Don't let them down.

29:21.110 --> 29:25.082
When the others get back
from the parade we will then
talk about what's best.

29:26.549 --> 29:29.886
The parade? That's right!
The parade!

29:29.886 --> 29:32.456
The parade for heroes.
Heroes like us.

29:32.456 --> 29:35.259
You're right!
There are people who love me.

29:35.259 --> 29:37.427
But I need to remind them why.

29:37.427 --> 29:40.864
Save the fucking chair.
I've got a parade to attend.

29:43.666 --> 29:45.970
[footsteps approaching]

29:49.839 --> 29:54.044
Is this, uh, your usual
thinking spot, because
I can go somewhere else.

30:01.018 --> 30:02.252
[sighs]

30:04.954 --> 30:08.925
You know, a few days ago,
I didn't exist.

30:11.661 --> 30:16.033
Yesterday everything
I cared about ceased to exist.

30:18.334 --> 30:22.206
I should just be...
grateful for the...

30:22.206 --> 30:25.809
heat of the sun
and wind in my ears

30:25.809 --> 30:30.747
and that weird smell of my sock
when I take off my boot.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.116
[Jane chuckles]

30:32.116 --> 30:34.879
But... I'm not.

30:37.453 --> 30:39.189
I just feel empty.

30:40.290 --> 30:42.426
Empty's a good word for it.

30:44.627 --> 30:48.132
[sighs] I thought
I needed a mission.

30:48.132 --> 30:50.334
Something to give me purpose.

30:50.334 --> 30:54.338
Purpose?
Purpose is overrated.

30:54.338 --> 30:56.873
Maybe it's okay not to know
what your next mission is.

30:56.873 --> 30:59.276
Maybe that leads
to a new kind adventure.

31:07.250 --> 31:09.386
I heard about
this dumb parade in town,

31:09.386 --> 31:12.957
if you'd want to go
check that out with me,
for a bit.

31:15.391 --> 31:17.061
You know, I was just thinking

31:17.061 --> 31:20.965
that this planet
has the perfect amount
of gravity for a parade.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.341
[groans]

31:34.010 --> 31:35.479
[groans, sniffles]

31:37.948 --> 31:39.316
[chuckles]

31:40.818 --> 31:42.586
[soft music playing]

31:57.066 --> 32:01.871
Tell me. Why did you do it?
We had a plan.

32:01.871 --> 32:06.972
We almost escaped
Orqwith together.
Why go back to Immortus?

32:08.378 --> 32:10.080
[sighs]

32:11.681 --> 32:13.250
[Larry] You weren't there.

32:14.785 --> 32:16.586
You can't understand.

32:18.054 --> 32:19.589
I had to make a choice.

32:20.823 --> 32:23.027
I did what I felt I had to do.

32:23.027 --> 32:25.095
I don't... I don't get it.

32:25.095 --> 32:28.994
You never struck me
as the impulsive type.
I mean that sounds more like...

32:29.794 --> 32:31.501
[electrostatic buzzing]

32:32.068 --> 32:33.670
Ah!

32:33.670 --> 32:35.572
[Larry] What?

32:35.572 --> 32:37.707
I think I understand now.

32:37.707 --> 32:39.576
No, you couldn't possibly.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.312
Listen.

32:43.746 --> 32:46.550
I don't know what part of you
needs to hear this

32:46.550 --> 32:51.921
but you have to know,
there is no shame
believing in miracles.

32:51.921 --> 32:55.525
I spent my life
believing in them.
I don't plan on stopping now.

32:55.525 --> 32:58.628
Belief in miracles got Wally
and the others killed.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.565
I can't wait around
for miracles, Rama.

33:01.565 --> 33:03.467
I have to live
in the real world.

33:03.467 --> 33:06.503
You promised
we'd find another way.

33:06.503 --> 33:10.107
Well, you might want to check
the shelf life on that promise.

33:10.107 --> 33:12.442
I need to find
a new home for Keeg.

33:13.977 --> 33:15.912
We're dying, remember?

33:15.912 --> 33:18.949
I can't take care of him,
you can't take care of him.

33:18.949 --> 33:20.350
[bursts in laughter]

33:21.518 --> 33:23.653
[laughing]

33:25.754 --> 33:29.426
Had you already penciled me in
as a foster option
for the little one?

33:29.426 --> 33:32.496
No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.
I just...

33:34.430 --> 33:37.167
I want him to be safe.
That's all.

33:38.802 --> 33:41.705
[sighs]

33:41.705 --> 33:44.975
I'm going to hold you
to your promise
a little bit longer.

33:44.975 --> 33:46.276
[banging on door]

33:46.276 --> 33:47.677
[Cliff]
Larry, get your bandages on.

33:47.677 --> 33:50.047
We're going to that
stupid fucking parade.

33:50.047 --> 33:52.649
And I need help walking.

33:52.649 --> 33:55.285
Yeah. I'm a little busy
right now, Cliff.

33:55.285 --> 33:58.755
- Sorry about that, he's a--
- Well, I'm sorry.

33:58.755 --> 34:01.558
You only have so much time
on this Earth

34:01.558 --> 34:05.395
and your friends
want you to go to a parade.

34:05.395 --> 34:09.566
- Why wouldn't you go?
- [sputters] Yeah, I'm not
really a parade type of guy.

34:09.566 --> 34:13.637
I'm more of a stay-at-home
and stare-out-the-window
type of guy.

34:13.637 --> 34:16.406
Keeg, would you like to go
to a parade?

34:16.406 --> 34:18.875
[electrostatic buzzing]

34:18.875 --> 34:20.577
Well, that settles that.

34:22.446 --> 34:24.914
[grunts]

34:24.914 --> 34:31.321
I will rest on this
military-grade rectangle
you call a mattress,

34:31.321 --> 34:32.856
re-gather my strength.

34:33.952 --> 34:37.494
And you... go to a parade.

34:38.629 --> 34:40.497
[sighs]

34:40.497 --> 34:43.567
[soft piano music playing]

34:46.770 --> 34:48.133
[Larry] Hm.

34:48.133 --> 34:49.706
[chuckles] Thank you.

34:55.111 --> 34:57.847
[festive music playing]

35:00.751 --> 35:02.186
[laughing]

35:06.590 --> 35:08.492
[exhales]

35:08.492 --> 35:10.694
- Everything all right?
- Never better.

35:12.629 --> 35:13.763
[chuckles]

35:13.763 --> 35:15.632
So, uh, what do we think
of Isabel?

35:15.632 --> 35:18.068
Oh, I'll figure that out later.

35:18.068 --> 35:20.904
For now,
let's just enjoy the moment.

35:20.904 --> 35:26.043
Wow. That's quite a U-Turn.
What happened
to dark and vengeful?

35:26.043 --> 35:30.080
You never told me being
a superhero was so much fun.
[chuckles]

35:30.080 --> 35:32.049
Not just for the fame,

35:32.049 --> 35:36.286
but for the feeling
of doing something good
in the world

35:36.286 --> 35:38.122
and being recognized for it.

35:38.122 --> 35:39.623
Mm.

35:39.623 --> 35:43.127
But also, the fame.
[laughing]

35:43.127 --> 35:49.194
It's nice
to finally be recognized
and experience the fame.

35:49.194 --> 35:51.935
[laughing] You're not wrong.

35:51.935 --> 35:54.871
[sighs] Man, I'd be
lying if I said
I didn't miss it a bit.

35:54.871 --> 35:56.806
Ah, come off it, Victor.

35:56.806 --> 36:01.245
You and I both know
you're destined for something
bigger than this.

36:01.245 --> 36:05.815
You're not going to spend
the rest of your life
taking care of ageing heroes.

36:07.050 --> 36:08.986
- You're Cyborg.
- I'm not--

36:08.986 --> 36:13.523
One day, you're going
to realize that
our little Doom Patrol

36:13.523 --> 36:17.222
just isn't enough for you
anymore. And then...

36:20.029 --> 36:22.666
[Isabel humming]

36:25.736 --> 36:28.505
Hey! Remember me?

36:28.505 --> 36:30.407
How could I forget?

36:31.174 --> 36:33.277
RIght.

36:33.277 --> 36:39.083
I just had a few questions,
you know, for my peace of mind
just to... clear the air.

36:39.083 --> 36:42.352
- Go on.
- Well, it was...

36:42.352 --> 36:45.956
my fault that
you fell into that time hole.

36:45.956 --> 36:50.427
It's my fault that all of this
happened to you, but...

36:50.427 --> 36:52.529
I just wanted to check
that you're okay.

36:52.529 --> 36:55.465
You know,
you were dealt a bad hand.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.567
As was I.

36:58.601 --> 37:00.770
That doesn't make us evil, right?

37:02.971 --> 37:06.243
I don't know
who you think you are,

37:06.243 --> 37:08.712
but you don't know
anything about me.

37:08.712 --> 37:13.017
I have everything...
[laughing]
I have ever wanted.

37:14.017 --> 37:17.687
I'm not evil, I'm famous.

37:17.687 --> 37:20.958
Unfortunately,
I don't believe you...

37:22.425 --> 37:23.827
Immortus.

37:27.430 --> 37:29.294
What did you just call me?

37:29.294 --> 37:31.368
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I say "Immortus"?

37:32.202 --> 37:33.137
[chuckles]

37:33.137 --> 37:34.738
I meant, Isabel.

37:35.871 --> 37:38.442
[distorted] You dare
utter my true name?

37:38.442 --> 37:44.048
You dare meddle
in my unending legacy
with your mortal clumsiness?

37:44.048 --> 37:45.715
[laughing]

37:45.715 --> 37:49.453
I have seen
your pathetic demise,
Laura De Mille,

37:49.453 --> 37:52.122
as I have seen all things.

37:52.122 --> 37:57.061
But I will gladly rewrite
your history
so that you die today!

37:57.761 --> 37:58.828
[gasping]

38:00.396 --> 38:02.266
[tape rewinding]

38:02.266 --> 38:03.667
[Isabel humming]

38:05.868 --> 38:10.474
- Hey, remember me?
- Sorry, I'm too busy
for selfies right now.

38:10.474 --> 38:14.078
I have to go receive
the key to the city.
Wish me luck!

38:18.943 --> 38:21.685
[crowd cheering]

38:25.488 --> 38:27.457
Do we wave?

38:30.760 --> 38:34.431
[Cliff] I had no idea
we had actual fans.

38:34.431 --> 38:38.768
[Larry] Turns out a very small,
very select group of people
care about us.

38:40.503 --> 38:42.672
[Jane] What the fuck
is that supposed to be?

38:42.672 --> 38:44.308
[crowd chanting] Blob! Blob!

38:44.308 --> 38:46.110
[Rita] That's me!

38:46.110 --> 38:47.677
[laughing]

38:49.278 --> 38:52.682
Blob! Blob! Blob! Blob!

38:54.383 --> 38:56.086
Thank you so much.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.524
Isn't it amazing they're here?

39:00.524 --> 39:03.388
Real superheroes, in Cloverton!

39:03.388 --> 39:08.966
Superheroes? [chuckles]
You mean the freaks out there
on the donkey?

39:08.966 --> 39:11.868
[Larry] Hey,
since we're superheroes again,

39:11.868 --> 39:14.038
I might need everyone's help.

39:14.038 --> 39:15.239
I'm dying.

39:15.239 --> 39:17.975
And Mr. 104
is destabilizing.

39:17.975 --> 39:20.144
If we don't figure out
a solution,

39:20.144 --> 39:23.280
we're probably going to blow up
the entire planet.

39:23.280 --> 39:29.586
Well, I'm sure that's something
the Doom Patrol can help with,
right, Jane?

39:29.586 --> 39:32.957
I don't know.
I might need help too.

39:32.957 --> 39:35.025
I can't find my way
back into the Underground

39:35.025 --> 39:38.228
and I need to get back there
before I forget forever.

39:38.228 --> 39:40.930
That's... complex. But--

39:40.930 --> 39:44.534
If we're all listing problems,
remember that Zombie Butt?

39:44.534 --> 39:47.071
The one I was supposed to kill?

39:47.071 --> 39:49.139
Uh, I didn't kill it.

39:50.006 --> 39:51.341
Yet.

39:51.341 --> 39:52.909
But I did lose it.

39:54.077 --> 39:55.512
[Larry] What the hell?

39:55.512 --> 39:56.480
- [clanging]
- [Cliff] Whoa, whoa.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.614
[Jane] Idiot!

39:59.882 --> 40:02.852
I don't understand.
This is a Rescue Celebration.

40:02.852 --> 40:06.590
I was the one who got rescued.
This parade is supposed to be
all about me.

40:06.590 --> 40:08.525
Of course it's about you.

40:08.525 --> 40:11.328
You were missing
and now you're found.

40:11.328 --> 40:13.763
But the Doom Patrol...

40:13.763 --> 40:16.133
Ah, the Doom Patrol,
they found you.

40:16.133 --> 40:17.701
I mean, they're heroes.

40:17.701 --> 40:20.270
And you are the reason
why they are heroes.

40:20.270 --> 40:25.375
Which is why you were chosen
to present them
with the key to the city.

40:25.375 --> 40:29.313
I'm sorry, did you just say...
[chuckles nervously]

40:29.313 --> 40:31.848
I thought you were giving
me the key to the city.

40:31.848 --> 40:34.518
Sure. We're giving you
the key to the city

40:34.518 --> 40:37.482
so you can give them
the key to the city.

40:39.723 --> 40:41.091
Does that make sense?

40:41.091 --> 40:42.759
Excuse me. Rita!

40:43.994 --> 40:46.964
Rita! Rita! Rita!

40:46.964 --> 40:47.931
Rouge! Hi!

40:47.931 --> 40:49.599
We've got to get out of here!

40:49.599 --> 40:52.402
- What?
- There's something wrong
with Isabel,

40:52.402 --> 40:53.803
we have to stop her.

40:53.803 --> 40:56.040
After you hand them
the key to the city,

40:56.040 --> 40:57.942
I'll make the big announcement...

40:57.942 --> 41:00.244
[voice fades]
we're making today
into a town holiday.

41:00.244 --> 41:04.648
From here on out,
June 5th will be known
as Doom Patrol Day.

41:04.648 --> 41:07.017
[tense music swells]

41:08.684 --> 41:10.654
[Isabel] Doom Patrol Day?

41:12.989 --> 41:15.025
Doom Patrol Day?

41:15.025 --> 41:16.026
[thunder rumbling]

41:16.026 --> 41:17.894
Doom Patrol Day?

41:17.894 --> 41:21.898
Fuck this!

41:21.898 --> 41:24.801
[roaring]
