00:04.136 --> 00:05.510
<i>Previously on "Stitchers"...</i>

00:05.549 --> 00:08.057
Hey, Fisher. Welcome to
the Stitchers Program.

00:08.102 --> 00:10.157
Kirsten, I have to tell you
something. It's about Ed Clarke.

00:10.182 --> 00:12.749
L.A.P.D. is officially
ruling his death as a suicide.

00:12.774 --> 00:14.693
I'm looking forward to
the day I prove you wrong.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.768
Kirsten: <i>Ed ripped someone
out of this picture.</i>

00:17.793 --> 00:18.838
<i>Any ideas who it was?</i>

00:18.863 --> 00:22.233
Maggie: No, but I assume it's someone
he didn't think very highly of.

00:22.258 --> 00:25.360
Does anyone outside of the program
know the nature of your work here?

00:25.385 --> 00:26.519
Not that I'm aware of.

00:26.544 --> 00:28.037
But what about inside the program?

00:28.062 --> 00:31.549
If you ever feel uncomfortable
or experience any side effects,

00:31.574 --> 00:32.734
promise you'll tell me, okay?

00:32.738 --> 00:35.207
Cameron: <i>Peter Brandt.
This gent's our bomber.</i>

00:35.232 --> 00:38.600
Lisa Keller died last night at a rave
in Hollywood from a drug overdose.

00:38.625 --> 00:41.729
Maggie: <i>Lilly Ross. Lilly and her
husband Scott were on their honeymoon.</i>

00:41.754 --> 00:43.370
<i>He found her body in the alley.</i>

00:43.394 --> 00:45.428
Stitching affects you. Makes
you different for a little bit.

00:45.453 --> 00:46.887
Sometimes people get hurt.

00:50.225 --> 00:52.169

01:22.011 --> 01:23.713
You forgot the cheese.

01:23.738 --> 01:26.167
Well, good morning,
Camille. How'd you sleep?

01:26.192 --> 01:28.205
Fine. Thanks for asking. You?

01:42.558 --> 01:44.326
Who sent you "Catcher in the Rye"?

01:44.351 --> 01:45.884
I don't know. I found it out front

01:45.909 --> 01:47.476
when I came back from my run.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.803
- Who said you could open my stuff?
- Force of habit.

01:49.828 --> 01:51.548
At least now I don't have to reseal it

01:51.573 --> 01:53.226
and pretend it never happened.

01:56.631 --> 01:59.266
You know what? Speaking
of personal boundaries,

01:59.392 --> 02:01.426
you wore my YFB shirt, didn't you?

02:01.469 --> 02:04.404
Me? No. Why?

02:05.689 --> 02:07.156
Because it smells like curry

02:07.181 --> 02:09.512
and you love curry, and I hate curry.

02:10.490 --> 02:13.722
Hey, can I borrow your shirt
for a date I have last night?

02:13.747 --> 02:16.383
You can't ask today for
something you borrowed yesterday.

02:16.417 --> 02:18.584
But with you everything feels
like it already happened.

02:18.619 --> 02:22.180
- And?
- So let's move my asking to borrow your shirt

02:22.351 --> 02:24.781
to yesterday, where it belongs.

02:25.273 --> 02:28.981
Yes, you can borrow my shirt.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.958
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:31.983 --> 02:34.952
Well, this is good. This is progress.

02:35.135 --> 02:36.836
You and me, roomies.

02:36.861 --> 02:38.961
We're sharing each other's
stuff, and you know what?

02:39.060 --> 02:40.930
I haven't read "Catcher
in the Rye" in awhile.

02:40.955 --> 02:42.586
And it is kind of awesome,
so can I borrow it?

02:42.611 --> 02:44.875
- No.
- Okay. Baby steps it is.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.451
Do we have any cheese?

02:51.872 --> 02:54.381
Justin Link, 30, died
of a massive heart attack

02:54.406 --> 02:56.674
after the breakfast rush at his food truck.

02:56.817 --> 02:59.018
- Oh, I love that truck.
- Why?

02:59.083 --> 03:01.018
All it has is ridiculously expensive toast.

03:01.043 --> 03:02.444
It's artisanal toast.

03:02.469 --> 03:04.169
Both: And now he's toast.

03:06.832 --> 03:08.600
If he wasn't murdered, why
are we stitching into him?

03:08.634 --> 03:11.036
Because when he wasn't
serving up toast and coffee,

03:11.070 --> 03:13.572
Justin was quite the
busy conspiracy blogger.

03:13.606 --> 03:15.306
Bigfoot and aliens kind of stuff, or...

03:15.340 --> 03:18.076
More like 9/11 was a false flag operation.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.168
- He was a nutbag.
- Actually, Justin was ex-CIA.

03:21.193 --> 03:23.261
Went off the reservation a few years ago.

03:24.316 --> 03:25.983
As you can see from his blog,

03:26.017 --> 03:28.132
Justin lost himself in conspiracies

03:28.157 --> 03:30.792
about government secrecy,
spying, and cover-ups.

03:30.817 --> 03:33.704
He's here, and we are
stitching into him, Linus,

03:33.729 --> 03:36.030
because his posts consistently came

03:36.055 --> 03:37.523
a bit too close to the truth,

03:37.548 --> 03:40.206
because nobody's been able
to determine his sources,

03:40.231 --> 03:41.899
and because he ruffled the feathers

03:41.933 --> 03:44.602
of an alphabet soup of government agencies.

03:44.636 --> 03:47.604
Justin claimed to have
thousands of classified documents

03:47.630 --> 03:48.749
locked up tight.

03:48.774 --> 03:51.049
Let me guess. Somewhere
nobody could locate them.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.065
Well, he was trained
to operate off the grid.

03:54.212 --> 03:56.713
The day before yesterday
Justin wrote that he received

03:56.747 --> 04:02.388
classified documentation at 6:57
A.M. about another government program

04:02.413 --> 04:05.354
and conspiracy the public
needs to know about.

04:05.388 --> 04:08.057
Here he promised to post it tonight.

04:08.092 --> 04:09.659
And as luck would have it

04:09.693 --> 04:12.294
drops dead of natural causes

04:12.329 --> 04:14.111
before he can go public with it.

04:14.136 --> 04:16.338
As far as we know, it
was just a heart attack.

04:16.363 --> 04:17.676
The silver lining, however,

04:17.701 --> 04:20.003
is we now have the
opportunity to find out how

04:20.036 --> 04:23.437
and from whom he's been getting
his classified information.

04:23.567 --> 04:24.553
Ready?

04:25.348 --> 04:29.121
- Stations, please.
- Sample is online.

04:29.146 --> 04:31.247
Stitch neurosync in three.

04:31.273 --> 04:32.973
Remember, Kirsten, we're
looking for Justin's stash

04:33.016 --> 04:34.793
of alleged government goodies and sources.

04:34.818 --> 04:37.328
Two! Justin's mind is a quagmire

04:37.353 --> 04:38.633
of weirdly interconnected links,

04:38.655 --> 04:39.988
so brace yourself. One!

04:40.023 --> 04:42.423
Bones, buckle up. It's
going to be a bumpy ride.

04:43.827 --> 04:45.543
And mark.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.622
Whoa. Cameron, what's happening?

04:51.734 --> 04:53.268
Woman: <i>Government conspiracy.</i>

04:53.302 --> 04:54.977
Man: <i>Uncovering the truth.</i>

04:55.544 --> 04:57.645
Man #2: <i>Technology, spying covertly...</i>

04:57.670 --> 04:58.949
Woman: <i>The world order.</i>

04:58.974 --> 05:00.536
Okay, this is weird.

05:01.658 --> 05:04.437
(Overlapping voices)

05:07.683 --> 05:09.016
And that's what I'm saying.

05:09.051 --> 05:10.785
Carbs, good.

05:10.819 --> 05:14.036
Food pyramid promulgated by Uncle Sam, bad.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.256
What do you see, little darling?

05:16.291 --> 05:19.760
I'm at his truck and in
his blog at the same time.

05:19.795 --> 05:20.861
Do something.

05:20.896 --> 05:23.630
I mean, it's obviously
a government-sponsored

05:23.665 --> 05:25.499
soft-kill eugenics program

05:25.533 --> 05:27.554
designed to depopulate the Earth.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.069
Who's got the maple butter?

05:29.094 --> 05:31.053
So Justin's a little
multiphasic little bugger.

05:31.079 --> 05:33.149
- Linus, filters, please.
- Mm-hmm.

05:33.174 --> 05:34.444
You don't even want to know

05:34.469 --> 05:36.717
what the Department of Defense
is loading into chemtrails.

05:36.742 --> 05:38.510
Running the filter in three,

05:38.535 --> 05:40.328
two, one.

05:40.353 --> 05:43.132
Agribusiness is killing off honey bees

05:43.157 --> 05:45.757
so they can corner the
food supply with GMOs.

05:46.206 --> 05:48.008
- Better?
- Yeah.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.756
A little.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.968
No. No, wait.

05:54.993 --> 05:58.468
Uh, I'm not sure.

05:58.493 --> 06:00.094
Her limbic system is teetering.

06:00.119 --> 06:01.786
Paranoid reaction is elevated.

06:01.811 --> 06:03.288
Oh, crap.

06:03.313 --> 06:06.086
Oh, that's good. Thank you.

06:08.538 --> 06:10.287
Ayo: She's getting into trouble.

06:16.759 --> 06:19.027
- Deets, please.
- I can't.

06:19.052 --> 06:20.686
Too many. It's coming too fast.

06:20.711 --> 06:23.031
Her brain is spinning
into insanity and beyond.

06:23.056 --> 06:24.723
Ok, just take a deep breath, Kirsten.

06:24.758 --> 06:25.991
Just focus on what's real.

06:26.032 --> 06:27.312
I'm in the brain of a dead man.

06:27.337 --> 06:29.939
I work in a secret lab underneath
a mediocre Chinese restaurant.

06:29.964 --> 06:32.131
You tell me what's real and
I'll happily focus on that.

06:32.156 --> 06:34.508
Cameron: Insane times
call for insane measures.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.100
Okay. Kirsten?

06:36.135 --> 06:37.273
You need to find his home base.

06:37.298 --> 06:40.434
Click your heels and say "there's
no place like home" three times.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.293
You can't be serious.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.976
You need an anchor. The Oz
reference might ground you.

06:45.001 --> 06:48.837
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

06:48.862 --> 06:50.462
There's no place like home.

06:51.975 --> 06:54.319
Where you at now, Stretch?

06:55.315 --> 06:57.650
In his home.

06:57.675 --> 06:59.776
But home is inside the truck.

06:59.801 --> 07:01.301
He cooked where he slept?

07:01.326 --> 07:03.527
I'm so glad I didn't know
that when I ate there.

07:03.552 --> 07:04.719
We're wasting time.

07:04.744 --> 07:06.744
She needs to find where
he kept his secrets.

07:06.769 --> 07:09.471
Did he have a secure storage
area of some sort maybe?

07:09.496 --> 07:10.929
Like a safe, perhaps?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.101
No, not that I can...

07:13.142 --> 07:14.476
hold on.

07:14.526 --> 07:16.555
I think he's up to something.

07:31.508 --> 07:33.710
You're not going to freaking believe this.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.456
(Theme music playing)

07:42.400 --> 07:46.103
<i>♪ Take me inside ♪</i>

07:48.029 --> 07:51.029
♪ <i>take me inside </i>♪

07:51.154 --> 07:55.054
1x05 - <i>Stitcher in the Rye</i>

08:13.863 --> 08:15.676
What exactly are we looking for here?

08:15.701 --> 08:17.276
You'll see.

08:31.126 --> 08:33.394
Yeah, you might not want to...

08:34.812 --> 08:36.229
oh.

08:37.965 --> 08:40.833
By the power of grey skull.

08:40.859 --> 08:42.961
I think I went to kindergarten
with those computers.

08:42.986 --> 08:45.053
Yeah, they're pre-wireless, pre-Internet,

08:45.078 --> 08:46.351
totally unhackable.

08:46.595 --> 08:50.607
He's got subcategories
in his sub-subcategories,

08:50.632 --> 08:52.900
ciphers in his ciphers.

08:52.934 --> 08:54.951
Justin wasn't taking any chances.

08:55.059 --> 08:58.950
He's date and time-stamped
everything, too.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.950
I think I found what Justin
was going to post tonight.

09:03.299 --> 09:05.051
- Uh-oh.
- What uh-oh?

09:05.483 --> 09:07.976
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go.

09:15.276 --> 09:18.270
(Car alarm blaring)

09:19.359 --> 09:20.760
Well, that's great.

09:39.362 --> 09:41.657
I think I read about these once.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.005
What kind of dark magic is this?

09:44.039 --> 09:46.884
Linus, do we even have anything
around here that can play this?

09:46.909 --> 09:49.470
Um, let me jump in my DeLorean,

09:49.494 --> 09:51.495
I'll go back to the future
and see if I can grab it.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.649
We've got to tell Maggie.
She's not going to be happy.

09:53.674 --> 09:55.549
We could say something like,

09:55.574 --> 09:58.360
"Maggie, you look lovely today.

09:58.385 --> 10:00.446
"But this ancient disk of Justin's

10:00.471 --> 10:03.345
can't be read by any of our
fancy government technology!"

10:04.136 --> 10:05.502
So what did you get off the disk?

10:05.527 --> 10:08.328
Nothing. That ancient disk can't
be read by anything in our lab.

10:08.386 --> 10:10.687
Did I mention you're looking lovely today?

10:10.712 --> 10:13.180
Justin's brain had a very short lifespan.

10:13.205 --> 10:14.905
There's not going to be another stitch.

10:14.930 --> 10:17.532
So, Dr. Goodkin, when
choosing between solutions,

10:17.557 --> 10:20.859
and kissing my ass, I vote for solutions.

10:21.673 --> 10:24.709
I suppose we could find an old drive

10:24.734 --> 10:26.827
and an interface board,
and we might be able

10:26.852 --> 10:30.387
to cobble up a transfer
protocol of some kind.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.321
Yeah, I'll check the net for parts.

10:32.346 --> 10:34.080
I'll start working on a wiring diagram.

10:34.105 --> 10:35.806
Have it done by noon tomorrow.

10:37.444 --> 10:39.634
Dr. Goodkin?

10:39.659 --> 10:42.561
Yeah, it's something Maggie
calls me when she's annoyed.

10:42.586 --> 10:44.235
She must call you that a lot.

10:44.259 --> 10:45.759
What's going on?

10:45.784 --> 10:49.054
You said to tell you

10:49.079 --> 10:51.433
if something was weird in the stitch.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.258
What happened? You
feeling okay? What is it?

10:53.283 --> 10:56.719
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
It's just I'm seeing stuff

10:56.744 --> 10:59.145
that doesn't make sense.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.673
That's the nature of what we do.

11:00.698 --> 11:02.321
We make sense of these...

11:02.346 --> 11:03.713
I don't mean that.

11:03.738 --> 11:07.341
I mean I'm seeing things
that seem out of place

11:07.366 --> 11:09.297
in a particular person's memory.

11:09.322 --> 11:12.241
And now I'm seeing that same oddball thing

11:12.266 --> 11:13.966
in more than one person.

11:14.194 --> 11:15.395
I'm not following.

11:15.420 --> 11:18.298
- Peter Brandt, remember him?
- Revenge bomber.

11:18.323 --> 11:20.907
I saw a Teddy Bear in his memories.

11:22.164 --> 11:25.489
Well, maybe it was his
from when he was a kid.

11:25.514 --> 11:27.081
Maybe.

11:27.106 --> 11:30.175
But then why did I see that exact same bear

11:30.200 --> 11:32.001
in Justin's memory?

11:32.026 --> 11:34.594
- How can that happen?
- It can't.

11:34.619 --> 11:37.607
So it's likely that it's a memory
that belongs to neither of them.

11:39.535 --> 11:41.302
So it's mine?

11:41.327 --> 11:43.196
It's possible.

11:44.001 --> 11:46.680
I don't remember ever having
a Teddy Bear like that.

11:48.950 --> 11:52.636
I don't remember anything before
my father ditched me with Ed Clark.

11:54.573 --> 11:58.101
Why would I start
remembering that stuff now?

11:58.877 --> 12:01.148
Could have something to do
with hooking your brain up

12:01.173 --> 12:03.923
to a quantum computer and
running enough power through it

12:03.948 --> 12:05.511
to light up a small city.

12:05.536 --> 12:09.572
I found an old picture that Ed
left for me, of him and my mother.

12:09.597 --> 12:12.112
He wrote the word "remember" on the back.

12:14.566 --> 12:16.311
Remember what?

12:22.247 --> 12:24.551
Thanks, Doc.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.430
Huh. K is missing.

12:46.455 --> 12:48.189
(Cellphone chimes)

13:08.909 --> 13:10.476
Time's up.

13:14.163 --> 13:15.830
Do you remember what I said?

13:15.855 --> 13:17.770
I thought you said I had five more minutes.

13:17.795 --> 13:19.641
Yes, and those five minutes are up.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.082
I have work to do. It's my
turn to use the computer.

13:22.107 --> 13:24.141
You've got more computers in the garage.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.734
Those are too old and slow.

13:26.759 --> 13:28.726
It has been five minutes, Kirsten.

13:28.751 --> 13:30.882
I don't know what five minutes feels like.

13:31.645 --> 13:35.682
Five minutes feels like... that.

14:45.565 --> 14:48.985
- (Knocking on door)
- I'm coming!

14:49.416 --> 14:51.685
Hold your water. God.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.035
What does this look like to you?

15:03.378 --> 15:05.245
The algorithm for stitching.

15:06.465 --> 15:08.932
Thank you for waking me up in the
middle of the night to show this to me.

15:08.957 --> 15:10.625
Now, bye-bye.

15:11.874 --> 15:15.209
Ask me why I would risk my high-level
clearance to all things stitchers

15:15.234 --> 15:16.744
by removing this from the lab.

15:16.769 --> 15:19.470
Because rules mean nothing to you.

15:19.504 --> 15:22.349
That would be true if I had
actually taken it off premises,

15:22.374 --> 15:23.474
but I didn't.

15:23.499 --> 15:25.100
I got it off this.

15:26.044 --> 15:28.012
Justin had that on that?

15:28.046 --> 15:29.580
You know what this means?

15:29.614 --> 15:31.983
Someone from inside the
stitchers program gave it to him.

15:32.017 --> 15:33.417
There's that.

15:33.451 --> 15:36.052
And I can't rule out the
possibility it was you.

15:41.512 --> 15:45.254
Why would I leak the most crucial
information about my own lab?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.356
Eliminate the impossible
and whatever's left,

15:47.381 --> 15:49.481
no matter how improbable,
must be the truth.

15:49.506 --> 15:52.208
You leaking the algorithm
for some unknown reason

15:52.233 --> 15:53.560
is not impossible.

15:54.373 --> 15:57.502
Um, how do I know it wasn't you?

15:57.527 --> 15:59.739
Why would I wake you up to divulge the leak

15:59.764 --> 16:01.164
if I was the one doing the leaking?

16:01.189 --> 16:04.339
To, uh, double fake me out?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.132
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

16:06.157 --> 16:07.624
To prove you didn't do it.

16:07.649 --> 16:09.738
You can't prove a negative.

16:09.763 --> 16:12.438
You can't not prove that I can't.

16:14.505 --> 16:16.840
- Phone.
- What happened to trust?

16:16.874 --> 16:18.375
Trust? Here's trust.

16:18.409 --> 16:20.844
When we first met you
pretended to be an anal jerk

16:20.878 --> 16:23.789
only to cover that you were
a slightly less anal jerk.

16:23.814 --> 16:25.347
You do things you don't want to talk about

16:25.382 --> 16:27.584
and you don't share anything
with me other than recipes.

16:27.618 --> 16:29.351
I told you what really
happened to Marta, didn't I?

16:29.386 --> 16:31.821
Nothing I couldn't have
figured out on my own.

16:31.855 --> 16:35.291
Yes or no? Did you leak
the algorithm to Justin?

16:35.325 --> 16:37.560
- No!
- There's only a handful of people

16:37.594 --> 16:39.703
who have high-level clearance
to access those codes.

16:39.728 --> 16:43.304
- You're one of them.
- Yeah, and so is Maggie, Linus, and Camille.

16:46.503 --> 16:47.769
So weird.

16:47.804 --> 16:49.771
I keep getting these spam messages.

16:49.806 --> 16:51.540
You know what this is?

16:51.575 --> 16:53.675
This is residual emotion from the stitch.

16:53.710 --> 16:56.244
You're experiencing Justin's
general distrust of everything.

16:56.278 --> 16:58.714
Give me your phone, Dr. Smartypants.

16:58.748 --> 17:01.917
Dr. Smartypants. That's
the best you can do?

17:01.951 --> 17:04.352
I don't mock the stupid names you call me.

17:04.386 --> 17:07.280
They're terms of endearment, Dopey.

17:07.305 --> 17:09.124
And B.T.W., that wasn't one of them.

17:09.148 --> 17:11.450
That was an insult because you are being...

17:11.493 --> 17:13.305
Dopey. I get it.

17:13.329 --> 17:16.205
Ouch. Phone.

17:19.101 --> 17:21.702
- What are you doing?
- Checking tracking location

17:21.737 --> 17:24.811
to see where you were
at 6:57 A.M. two days ago

17:24.837 --> 17:26.875
when the stitchers information
was handed off to Justin.

17:26.907 --> 17:29.844
- I disabled the app.
- Not well enough.

17:32.313 --> 17:34.348
You were home. You didn't do it.

17:34.382 --> 17:36.851
Hmm. You seem disappointed.

17:36.885 --> 17:39.136
Your turn. Let me see your phone.

17:44.058 --> 17:46.660
I disabled tracking and
the encrypted uplink,

17:46.694 --> 17:48.737
like you could have if you'd known how.

17:49.414 --> 17:52.337
Well, don't feel bad. Not many people do.

17:53.855 --> 17:56.537
- Guess I'll have to trust you.
- Just like that?

17:57.197 --> 17:58.936
And I'm the dopey one?

18:01.042 --> 18:04.310
- What are you doing?
- Hacking into Linus' lonely world

18:04.344 --> 18:05.745
to see if he's the leak.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.024
You can't seriously think that...

18:07.049 --> 18:08.790
Like you said, he's one of the few people

18:08.815 --> 18:10.660
who have access to the full algorithm.

18:10.685 --> 18:13.086
- Yeah, but I only said that...
- Just to cover yourself?

18:13.120 --> 18:15.633
- Yes, but...
- He's got his system on lockdown.

18:16.523 --> 18:18.483
You're invading his privacy.
You know that, right?

18:18.492 --> 18:20.826
We're stitchers. We invade
privacy for a living.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.395
Yes, but this is Linus.

18:22.429 --> 18:24.029
Look, I only need to see where he was

18:24.064 --> 18:25.864
when Justin claims to have
received the stitching codes.

18:25.899 --> 18:27.966
Why don't you just call his
mother to check his alibi?

18:28.001 --> 18:30.169
- Good idea.
- Now, now. Come on, Kirsten.

18:30.204 --> 18:31.504
And look at it this way.

18:31.538 --> 18:33.972
How would you feel if one of
us hacked into your stuff, huh?

18:34.007 --> 18:36.274
My stuff is totally unhackable, so...

18:36.309 --> 18:38.143
I'd be impressed.

18:40.422 --> 18:42.295
My mother won't run my life...

18:42.320 --> 18:44.349
One word. Capital on the "f".

18:44.383 --> 18:46.475
Linus' password.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.660
He told it to me when he
had too many Tequila shots.

18:49.685 --> 18:51.465
Okay, and for the record,

18:51.490 --> 18:55.793
someday you are going to have to learn
how to trust the people in your life.

18:55.828 --> 18:59.364
I'm in. He has two smart phones

18:59.398 --> 19:02.667
and five computers linked
to his home network system.

19:02.702 --> 19:04.329
Keystroke biometrics are
a match on all of them

19:04.354 --> 19:05.679
so we know only he uses them.

19:05.704 --> 19:07.872
- And... wow.
- What?

19:07.906 --> 19:10.241
For the last week Linus has
been pulling all-nighters

19:10.275 --> 19:13.544
playing <i>Minecraft, Knights
of the Old Republic,</i>

19:13.578 --> 19:17.448
<i>Tron Legacy,</i> and three
online chessgames simultaneously.

19:17.482 --> 19:19.617
We must find this man a girlfriend.

19:19.651 --> 19:23.714
He was playing online when
Justin was given the algorithm.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.908
- Oops.
- What "oops"?

19:27.044 --> 19:29.346
He just locked me out. He
knows we hacked into his...

19:29.371 --> 19:30.983
(ringing)

19:31.463 --> 19:33.564
Why were you hacking into my computer?

19:33.598 --> 19:35.198
To clear you of treason, Linus.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.901
Uh, yeah, which... that was all Kirsten.

19:37.935 --> 19:39.970
I knew you weren't guilty. You're welcome.

19:40.004 --> 19:42.172
How did she figure out my password?

19:42.206 --> 19:45.381
Uh, remember the other night after work?

19:45.406 --> 19:47.086
Damn you, Tequila.

19:47.111 --> 19:48.745
Someone leaked the algorithm

19:48.780 --> 19:50.680
for the stitch lab to Justin.

19:50.714 --> 19:51.748
Our stitch lab?

19:51.783 --> 19:54.217
No, the other stitch lab.
Yes, our stitch lab!

19:54.252 --> 19:56.218
And thanks to your gaming
addiction we know it wasn't you,

19:56.253 --> 19:57.933
and it wasn't me our Kirsten either, so...

19:57.954 --> 20:00.657
Well, the only other people
who have access to the codes,

20:00.691 --> 20:02.258
are Maggie and Camille.

20:02.293 --> 20:04.226
- And it couldn't have been Camille.
- Why not?

20:04.261 --> 20:06.763
Because it, uh, it couldn't.

20:06.797 --> 20:08.998
Yeah, that's not going
to fly with Sherlock here.

20:09.032 --> 20:10.966
She needs cold hard proof
that Camille isn't a baddie.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.681
So unless you were with her at the time...

20:12.702 --> 20:14.485
I wasn't with Camille that morning.

20:14.510 --> 20:17.415
Why would you say that? I mean, I
wasn't with Camille that morning,

20:17.440 --> 20:20.042
or any morning before work

20:20.076 --> 20:21.710
in the morning.

20:21.744 --> 20:24.113
Linus, I need you to get Camille and...

20:25.027 --> 20:26.628
that's my sweatshirt.

20:26.653 --> 20:28.453
That's my sweatshirt.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.045
Camille? Camille?

20:31.070 --> 20:34.165
Hey, Kirsten, can I borrow your sweatshirt

20:34.190 --> 20:36.291
for a booty call with Linus last night?

20:36.326 --> 20:39.027
You hooked up with Linus?

20:39.061 --> 20:40.796
You hooked up with Camille?

20:40.830 --> 20:43.565
Yeah. Go me!

20:43.599 --> 20:46.400
Look, to answer your question,

20:46.435 --> 20:48.436
Camille was staying at the hotel Linus

20:48.470 --> 20:50.138
while the algorithm was leaked to Justin.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.241
That leaves Maggie. She's going
to be at the stitch lab soon.

20:53.275 --> 20:54.843
Meet us there.

20:54.877 --> 20:56.510
Get dressed.

20:56.545 --> 20:59.780
Linus. Camille.

20:59.815 --> 21:02.383
You know what? Wear what
you're wearing. Let's go.

21:02.417 --> 21:06.051
Oh! Mind blown.

21:06.855 --> 21:09.724
Put these on. Cameron.

21:09.758 --> 21:12.292
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I
just... I just need a minute

21:12.327 --> 21:14.328
to digest what we just interrupted.

21:14.363 --> 21:15.863
Why? They only slept together.

21:15.897 --> 21:17.497
Yeah, but they work together, too.

21:17.531 --> 21:19.266
- So what?
- So, awkward!

21:19.300 --> 21:21.434
I mean, what if they break up?

21:21.469 --> 21:23.170
I mean, they have to see each
other every day at the office.

21:23.204 --> 21:25.839
They're adults. They can handle it.

21:25.874 --> 21:28.575
At least, Camille is... sometimes.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.735
- Anyway...
- So...

21:30.760 --> 21:33.632
You're okay with co-workers dating?

21:34.948 --> 21:37.550
Yeah. I'm not okay with
Linus wearing my sweatshirt.

21:37.585 --> 21:39.932
Now please, get dressed.

21:58.538 --> 22:00.639
Ugh. Thank goodness you're all here.

22:00.673 --> 22:03.021
- I have something I need to tell you.
- (Gunshots)

22:11.632 --> 22:13.141
- Call 911.
- Hey.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.291
I'm fine.

22:15.326 --> 22:17.594
Hold up! Wait!

22:17.629 --> 22:19.329
- Call them.
- If you call 911,

22:19.363 --> 22:22.041
if you call anyone, I will kill you.

22:24.382 --> 22:26.016
Hold up! Wait.

22:26.041 --> 22:29.242
Explain to me what we're going to do with
the armed assailant after we catch him.

22:42.002 --> 22:44.463
- How is she?
- She's fine, thank you.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.721
The bullet grazed her arm.

22:45.763 --> 22:47.697
I gave her a tetanus shot. She'll be fine.

22:47.724 --> 22:50.259
That was incredibly
reckless of both of you.

22:50.293 --> 22:52.461
Will you give us a moment?

22:53.435 --> 22:56.036
- Keep pressure on that.
- Yes, mother.

22:59.036 --> 23:02.004
That was on Justin's disk.

23:02.039 --> 23:04.005
I'm not sure I like your tone.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.441
The "you're the only person left

23:05.475 --> 23:07.008
who could have leaked the code" tone?

23:07.043 --> 23:08.444
Yeah, that one.

23:08.478 --> 23:11.434
So, did you leak the code?

23:12.449 --> 23:14.816
Linus, remember when we met?

23:14.850 --> 23:17.886
You were just 19, answered
that ad in your school paper.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.854
The agency posed a math problem

23:19.889 --> 23:22.123
and whoever could solve it
earned the right to apply

23:22.157 --> 23:24.425
to an elite government
position. Remember that?

23:24.460 --> 23:26.394
- Yes.
- And Cameron.

23:26.428 --> 23:29.230
Poor little rich boy
choking on that silver spoon

23:29.255 --> 23:30.990
mommy and daddy left in your mouth

23:31.015 --> 23:33.149
until I came along and gave meaning

23:33.174 --> 23:35.475
to that fabulous education they paid for.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.101
Where are you going with this?

23:37.126 --> 23:41.296
Camille, you were a lackluster PhD student

23:41.321 --> 23:43.222
who got a chance to run with the big dogs.

23:43.345 --> 23:46.581
But without me, you'd likely
have had to leave the program

23:46.615 --> 23:50.518
and take a teaching job with
some underfunded public school.

23:50.552 --> 23:53.453
You're nasty when you
get shot. You know that?

23:53.488 --> 23:56.523
My point is that I didn't
raise the three of them

23:56.557 --> 23:58.325
from the depths of obscurity

23:58.359 --> 24:01.005
only to risk your lives,
and my life, for that matter,

24:01.030 --> 24:03.673
by compromising the
program that I have spent

24:03.698 --> 24:05.999
the better part of two decades building.

24:06.034 --> 24:09.402
Plus, you will forgive me if I
don't put too delicate of a spin

24:09.437 --> 24:12.939
on this point, but I am
bleeding all over this desk.

24:14.174 --> 24:17.286
I didn't give the algorithm to
anybody outside of this office

24:17.311 --> 24:21.114
because at the time, I was having
breakfast with Leslie Turner.

24:21.148 --> 24:23.283
He is the director of the agency.

24:23.324 --> 24:26.860
Now go. Work the problem. Figure
out who leaked that document,

24:26.887 --> 24:28.821
and if you can, it would be nice

24:28.856 --> 24:31.690
if you found the son of
a bitch who shot me, too.

24:50.443 --> 24:53.379
Hey, so I think it's best
if we're just friends.

24:53.413 --> 24:54.913
With benefits?

24:54.947 --> 24:56.815
That's not enough for you, Linus.

24:56.849 --> 24:58.049
You know that.

24:58.084 --> 25:00.463
- No one inside the lab...
- Are we interrupting?

25:01.575 --> 25:03.409
What? Interrupting what?

25:03.434 --> 25:05.268
- No, no, no.
- Good.

25:06.458 --> 25:09.394
No one from inside the
lab leaked the algorithm.

25:09.428 --> 25:11.730
We've checked and rechecked
everyone who works here

25:11.764 --> 25:13.198
even people without high-level clearance.

25:13.232 --> 25:14.999
Ayo's apartment was tented for termites.

25:15.033 --> 25:16.634
She was at a friend's house that morning.

25:16.669 --> 25:19.204
And Bob the test tube guy? He
was working out with his trainer.

25:19.238 --> 25:20.738
Dude, I don't get it.

25:20.772 --> 25:22.940
The algorithm only exists
in hard copy, only in here.

25:22.974 --> 25:24.642
It didn't just walk out by itself.

25:24.677 --> 25:26.944
Maybe one of the Bumblebee drones got in

25:26.978 --> 25:28.213
and snapped a few pictures.

25:28.238 --> 25:30.292
Okay, let's take Justin's
tinfoil hat off, Sparky,

25:30.317 --> 25:33.118
and come at this from an angle
that's a tad more logical, yeah?

25:33.251 --> 25:35.119
There's not a lot to go on.

25:36.387 --> 25:38.334
You remember? In the stitch, you said

25:38.359 --> 25:39.800
that the images were
coming at you too fast.

25:39.825 --> 25:43.360
What if you did your brain-timey
thingy and slowed them down?

25:43.385 --> 25:45.305
Maybe there's something
in there that you missed.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.999
Guy in a suit. Nothing special.

25:50.034 --> 25:53.637
Envelope. Butterfly
tattoo on someone's wrist.

25:57.609 --> 26:00.009
Broken watch.

26:00.044 --> 26:02.186
Homeless guy in a wheelchair.

26:04.815 --> 26:06.986
That's all there is.

26:08.287 --> 26:10.122
I know who did it.

26:13.557 --> 26:15.825
I've seen this. If you could
tell us why we're watching it.

26:15.860 --> 26:17.393
Freeze it.

26:17.427 --> 26:20.063
- Zoom in on Marta's wrist.
- Magnifying 125.

26:20.097 --> 26:22.095
150. 250. Just tell me when.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.642
- 300.
- Stop.

26:23.667 --> 26:27.621
That exact tattoo was on a
woman's wrist in the stitch.

26:29.439 --> 26:31.674
Guys, I just got off the
phone with the hospital.

26:31.708 --> 26:33.175
Marta Rodriguez woke up

26:33.209 --> 26:35.077
and checked herself out almost a week ago.

26:35.111 --> 26:36.808
(Softly) Damn it.

26:37.447 --> 26:40.091
So it was Marta I saw
give Justin the envelope.

26:40.116 --> 26:43.185
- You're positive it was that tattoo?
- I am.

26:43.210 --> 26:46.045
It has to be Marta. She's the only
person beside us that has access.

26:46.089 --> 26:48.984
Then find her... from
inside the lab, people.

26:49.009 --> 26:51.964
If she took a shot at me, who's to
say she won't go after one of you?

26:57.433 --> 26:59.434
Marta's doctors said they
tried to follow up with her

26:59.468 --> 27:00.769
after she was discharged.

27:00.803 --> 27:01.869
They never heard back.

27:01.904 --> 27:03.904
Her landlord and neighbors
haven't seen her either.

27:04.940 --> 27:06.441
How well did you know Marta?

27:06.475 --> 27:08.777
You mean were we going out?

27:08.811 --> 27:11.745
You two seemed close.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.981
We were and we weren't.

27:14.016 --> 27:15.716
We were getting there.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.285
But then the accident happened.

27:18.321 --> 27:19.875
I'm sorry.

27:21.984 --> 27:24.653
Yeah, I visited her at the
hospital nearly every week.

27:24.678 --> 27:26.636
I brought her flowers.

27:26.661 --> 27:29.883
Sometimes I talked to her. I
thought that might wake her up.

27:30.699 --> 27:32.533
Maybe if I was there when she did...

27:32.567 --> 27:35.168
- You couldn't have stopped her.
- You don't know that.

27:35.203 --> 27:37.738
I'm beginning to understand
what stitching does to a person.

27:37.881 --> 27:40.817
I don't know how she could've
been unaffected afterwards

27:40.842 --> 27:42.276
even without the accident.

27:42.301 --> 27:45.776
She's just not like me.

27:46.338 --> 27:48.382
No one's like you, Stretch.

27:49.248 --> 27:51.986
So why'd you recruit her? She
doesn't have temporal dysplasia.

27:52.110 --> 27:54.518
N.S.A. profile showed
she was good in every area

27:54.543 --> 27:57.579
and off the charts in
one... protective instinct.

27:57.604 --> 27:59.424
So when she volunteered
to be our test pilot,

27:59.449 --> 28:01.124
we thought she'd be the right fit.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.424
What was Marta's specialty at the N.S.A.?

28:05.338 --> 28:06.917
Cryptography.

28:23.704 --> 28:27.696
C-I-T-R 94.

28:42.778 --> 28:45.012
Okay.

28:45.037 --> 28:46.738
"A" is "y."

28:48.051 --> 28:50.852
"K" is "d."

28:52.344 --> 28:54.219
"M" is "g."

30:01.568 --> 30:03.135
Marta.

30:05.290 --> 30:07.811
It's all good. You're going to be safe now.

30:20.727 --> 30:22.384
Have you guys seen Kirsten?

30:22.409 --> 30:23.961
No.

30:32.703 --> 30:34.304
Why are we here?

30:37.923 --> 30:41.726
(Music plays loudly)

30:43.595 --> 30:45.563
Marta, what are you doing?

30:45.597 --> 30:47.498
- What are you...
- Shh!

30:53.672 --> 30:55.840
Nobody's listening. Come on.

30:55.874 --> 30:58.108
Watch. I coded an app.

30:59.110 --> 31:01.078
It sweeps for radio frequency pulses.

31:01.112 --> 31:03.011
I check the house every day.

31:13.899 --> 31:16.868
Clear. It's clear. The place is clean.

31:16.942 --> 31:19.503
Let me see it. The phone, let me see it.

31:26.036 --> 31:27.804
I knew we were the same.

31:30.641 --> 31:31.941
Get packed.

31:35.221 --> 31:37.322
Why?

31:37.347 --> 31:39.581
I know a place. I'll take
you there. You'll be safe.

31:40.534 --> 31:41.835
Safe from what?

31:41.860 --> 31:42.893
Them.

31:42.918 --> 31:44.260
(Cellphone rings)

31:45.698 --> 31:47.760
It's Kirsten.

31:49.426 --> 31:50.759
Where are you?

31:50.794 --> 31:52.594
Who's them, Marta?

31:52.629 --> 31:54.930
Stitchers. They're evil.

31:54.964 --> 31:56.862
They have to be stopped.

31:58.267 --> 32:01.085
Kirsten: <i>So you leaked
the algorithm to Justin</i>

32:01.110 --> 32:02.511
<i>to stop stitchers.</i>

32:02.536 --> 32:03.935
Marta: <i>Exactly.</i>

32:04.240 --> 32:07.485
And when that didn't work,
I tried to kill Maggie.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.507
Marta: <i>How is that lying bitch?</i>

32:11.339 --> 32:14.408
Kirsten: <i>Bad. I don't think
she's going to make it.</i>

32:14.433 --> 32:15.834
Good.

32:15.987 --> 32:20.306
Otherwise I'd circle back
around and finish the job.

32:22.124 --> 32:24.093
You need to get packed. Now.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.991
My bedroom's in the back.

32:29.003 --> 32:30.592
Call Fisher.

32:33.268 --> 32:36.036
The Stitchers Program destroys people.

32:36.071 --> 32:37.371
It almost killed me.

32:37.405 --> 32:39.239
I heard you stayed in too long.

32:39.274 --> 32:40.541
Didn't bounce in time?

32:40.576 --> 32:42.092
Right. It's my fault.

32:42.971 --> 32:44.438
Cameron tell you that?

32:44.463 --> 32:47.791
Typical. He couldn't
possibly have made a mistake.

32:47.816 --> 32:51.053
- How do you know what you're feeling isn't...
- Residual emotion?

32:51.078 --> 32:52.245
No.

32:52.497 --> 32:55.751
What I'm feeling, what I know, is real.

32:55.776 --> 32:58.762
I know they'll use you like they used me

32:58.787 --> 33:01.327
until something goes wrong. And it will.

33:01.362 --> 33:05.386
And when that happens, they'll
try to make you disappear.

33:06.634 --> 33:09.235
The Stitchers Program was
created to help people.

33:09.409 --> 33:13.279
By sending us places, secret
places nobody should ever go.

33:14.341 --> 33:16.175
That's not how they see it.

33:16.210 --> 33:18.911
They turned us into grave-robbers.

33:21.382 --> 33:23.282
A newlywed killed on her honeymoon.

33:23.317 --> 33:27.253
An 18-year-old girl murdered
trying to save a friend.

33:27.287 --> 33:30.310
Some of those graves shouldn't
have been filled in the first place.

33:31.058 --> 33:34.026
Oh, you still think you're solving murders.

33:34.060 --> 33:36.962
They don't care who killed those people.

33:36.997 --> 33:40.810
They're sticking you in as
test runs for something bigger.

33:41.668 --> 33:43.368
Test runs?

33:43.403 --> 33:45.470
For what?

33:45.505 --> 33:47.172
I don't know.

33:47.206 --> 33:50.110
But if we don't leave now, we're both dead.

34:02.788 --> 34:04.556
Look who's here.

34:05.658 --> 34:07.992
Our knight in shining armor.

34:08.016 --> 34:10.418
It's over, Marta. We know what you did.

34:13.165 --> 34:14.899
He promise to take care of you?

34:17.937 --> 34:19.847
Like you took care of me?

34:22.239 --> 34:25.007
- Marta.
- Okay, Marta. Put the gun down.

34:26.150 --> 34:30.951
Did Cameron tell you to trust him...

34:32.612 --> 34:34.551
Like he told me?

34:36.525 --> 34:39.728
You're right. I asked you to
trust me and you shouldn't have.

34:39.753 --> 34:41.150
I let you down.

34:41.518 --> 34:43.251
(Sirens approaching)

34:45.043 --> 34:46.478
You hear those sirens?

34:46.503 --> 34:49.705
They're coming for you.
Get out now while you can.

34:49.730 --> 34:51.603
I have to protect you.

34:51.735 --> 34:54.204
I have to save you.

34:54.237 --> 34:59.150
You and I, we're the only two
people in the world who know!

35:07.026 --> 35:08.726
Police officer: Marta Rodriguez!

35:08.751 --> 35:10.086
(Cellphone ringing)

35:10.111 --> 35:11.611
This is the police!

35:11.636 --> 35:13.136
(Cellphone ringing)

35:13.417 --> 35:15.467
Come out with your hands up.

35:18.895 --> 35:21.166
How did you get this number?

35:24.273 --> 35:27.175
Marta Rodriguez, the place is surrounded.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.166
Come out with your hands up.

35:38.216 --> 35:40.750
I understand.

35:40.775 --> 35:43.444
(Helicopters overhead)

35:43.469 --> 35:45.446
Who was that?

35:46.888 --> 35:49.457
- Easy.
- Marta Rodriguez!

35:49.491 --> 35:51.058
The place is surrounded!

35:51.092 --> 35:53.701
Come out with your hands up!

35:54.708 --> 35:56.275
You're going to be safe now.

35:56.300 --> 35:58.201
Marta.

35:59.351 --> 36:01.868
Marta, don't go out there with that gun.

36:05.369 --> 36:08.627
Marta, give me the gun.

36:09.182 --> 36:10.786
Marta Rodriguez!

36:10.811 --> 36:13.313
- Come out with your hands in the air!
- Thank you...

36:13.347 --> 36:16.283
- For the flowers.
- Step out of the house.

36:16.317 --> 36:17.926
This is your final warning.

36:17.951 --> 36:20.552
- Marta, wait!
- Don't!

36:20.921 --> 36:22.389
Officer: Put the gun down

36:22.423 --> 36:23.890
and get down on the ground!

36:23.924 --> 36:26.625
Put the gun down and down on the ground!

36:26.660 --> 36:28.643
Do you hear me? You got to drop that gun!

36:28.668 --> 36:32.942
- Put it down!
- (Gunshots)

36:40.267 --> 36:42.220
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

36:42.245 --> 36:44.877
- We've been over this.
- You weren't working the controls that day.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.361
Marta stayed in the stitch too long.

36:46.586 --> 36:47.861
You weren't inside her head.

36:47.886 --> 36:49.553
You begged her to bounce, she wouldn't.

36:49.578 --> 36:52.152
- She couldn't.
- Because she violated protocol.

36:52.918 --> 36:54.851
You want to have a pity
party, fine. Have at it.

36:54.876 --> 36:57.094
But it ends before you
walk back in the lab.

36:57.119 --> 36:59.196
If I walk back in.

36:59.221 --> 37:02.797
You will, because no one understands
this technology the way you do.

37:02.822 --> 37:04.897
And no one else can keep Kirsten as safe.

37:08.109 --> 37:09.996
We're just about done here.

37:10.566 --> 37:12.097
Sorry it turned out like this.

37:12.122 --> 37:13.897
So are we.

37:14.188 --> 37:16.396
Arrange to divert Marta
back to the stitch lab.

37:16.421 --> 37:17.622
- Start the protocol.
- Cameron.

37:17.647 --> 37:18.722
Don't.

37:19.270 --> 37:20.822
Just don't.

37:23.644 --> 37:25.278
You called Marta, didn't you?

37:25.313 --> 37:27.856
- Called her?
- Before she went outside.

37:27.881 --> 37:30.249
You said something to
her that made her do this.

37:30.283 --> 37:31.954
It wasn't me.

37:31.979 --> 37:34.280
Because you were having
breakfast with Les Turner again?

37:34.305 --> 37:36.139
Because it wasn't me.

37:36.323 --> 37:38.224
How do I know you're telling the truth?

37:41.918 --> 37:44.386
Kirsten, we're not stitching into Marta.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.966
We need to know what she knows,

37:48.001 --> 37:49.801
who else she told about the program.

37:49.836 --> 37:51.102
It's too risky.

37:51.137 --> 37:52.638
Because someone else might try to kill you

37:52.672 --> 37:54.139
or because you don't want us to see

37:54.173 --> 37:56.474
what she really knew about stitchers?

37:56.509 --> 37:58.610
You want to drag Marta's body into the lab,

37:58.645 --> 38:00.012
slide her into the corpse cassette

38:00.046 --> 38:01.513
a few feet away from Cameron?

38:01.547 --> 38:05.231
Probe her deepest memories
that may include him?

38:05.256 --> 38:08.024
- He wants to do it.
- He only thinks that he does.

38:08.049 --> 38:10.216
Cameron's a big boy. He'll be fine.

38:10.241 --> 38:11.707
No, he won't.

38:11.732 --> 38:14.401
You saw what thinking he
caused Marta's coma did to him.

38:14.558 --> 38:17.926
Imagine how he'll react to
helping plunder her brain.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.227
Cameron is not like you, Kirsten. Trust me.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.771
- Trust you.
- Or not.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.839
I'm going to leave that one to you.

38:47.963 --> 38:50.630
Did Maggie tell you?

38:50.858 --> 38:52.781
No-go on stitching Marta?

38:54.098 --> 38:55.766
You okay?

38:57.168 --> 39:00.604
- Why people do that?
- Do what?

39:00.638 --> 39:04.274
Ask if you're okay when
they know you're not okay.

39:04.309 --> 39:05.842
You ever notice that?
People ask if you're okay

39:05.876 --> 39:08.177
more often when you're not
okay than when you are okay.

39:09.622 --> 39:11.824
Okay. So you're not okay.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.465
Actually...

39:14.718 --> 39:18.266
I think I am. For now.

39:19.027 --> 39:21.228
Maybe in a week or a month,

39:21.301 --> 39:22.968
a couple years from now, who knows?

39:22.993 --> 39:26.704
I'll be in my car and something
will remind me of Marta.

39:26.962 --> 39:29.664
And then it will hit me and then
for those moments I won't be okay.

39:29.689 --> 39:33.458
But... that's fine.

39:33.483 --> 39:36.479
Because if I didn't feel the loss,

39:36.504 --> 39:38.105
it would mean I didn't care.

39:39.909 --> 39:41.312
I didn't... I didn't mean that...

39:41.337 --> 39:43.045
I'm not saying that you don't care.

39:43.079 --> 39:44.937
I know you do, but...

39:47.016 --> 39:49.784
Do I wish that I could
process this all in an instant

39:49.818 --> 39:51.836
and put it behind me?

39:53.256 --> 39:56.457
Do I wish I was more like you?

39:56.491 --> 39:58.026
Yes.

40:00.173 --> 40:01.710
And no.

40:11.473 --> 40:13.407
Man: The program dodged a bullet this time.

40:19.414 --> 40:21.994
Your phone call to Marta
was well calculated.

40:23.181 --> 40:25.782
I appealed to her protective nature.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.526
I pointed out that if
the police brought her in,

40:28.623 --> 40:31.592
if the curtain were pulled back
from the Stitchers Program...

40:31.626 --> 40:33.594
The agency would have
to deal with all of us

40:33.628 --> 40:35.195
in an undesirable way.

40:36.598 --> 40:38.765
Marta was a good soldier.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.702
She knew what she had to
do to protect Kirsten and...

40:41.736 --> 40:43.036
She did it.

40:44.672 --> 40:47.673
Les, I lied to my team for you.

40:47.708 --> 40:50.567
I told them that Justin
died of a heart attack.

40:52.279 --> 40:54.880
You did your job, Maggie.

40:54.915 --> 40:58.318
You killed a man so that
you could stitch into him.

40:58.352 --> 41:02.121
We had solid intel
Justin had our algorithms.

41:03.289 --> 41:05.625
We needed to know if it was true.

41:05.659 --> 41:08.861
And if it was true, who gave it to him.

41:08.895 --> 41:10.967
So you didn't know it was Marta?

41:11.979 --> 41:14.795
If I had known, this all would
have played out very differently.

41:16.302 --> 41:18.970
Still, there had to be another way.

41:19.005 --> 41:21.173
There wasn't.

41:21.207 --> 41:23.509
I mean, for God's sake,
what was I supposed to do?

41:23.543 --> 41:25.277
Interrogate him?

41:25.311 --> 41:28.680
Justin was former C.I.A.
You know how you guys are.

41:28.714 --> 41:31.283
Conditioned not to crack.

41:31.317 --> 41:33.385
He had our algorithms.

41:33.419 --> 41:34.953
He was going to post
them for the world to see.

41:34.987 --> 41:37.555
And if he did? That's it.

41:37.589 --> 41:38.790
All over.

41:38.824 --> 41:41.026
The lab, the Stitchers Program.

41:41.060 --> 41:44.411
All of us gone for good.

41:45.552 --> 41:48.988
And our technology in the wrong hands.

41:51.101 --> 41:53.169
I wasn't going to let that happen.

41:56.124 --> 42:01.328
- That's all.
- Kirsten Clark is a smart girl.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.732
What do I tell her when she asks

42:02.757 --> 42:05.249
what our $8 billion program

42:05.284 --> 42:07.457
is really designed to do?

42:09.878 --> 42:11.511
Tell her whatever you want.

42:11.656 --> 42:13.724
As long as it's not the truth.
