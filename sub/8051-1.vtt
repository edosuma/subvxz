01:03.163 --> 01:04.938
Johnny English.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.246
Five years ago,
he was our top agent.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.882
Yeah. Took his eye off the ball
in Mozambique.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.290
Does it have to be him?

01:30.390 --> 01:33.098
He's the only one our contact will talk to.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.931
So where is he?

02:07.628 --> 02:12.600
You came here
to forget your life of shame.

02:13.667 --> 02:20.642
But the path you must tread to new life
will be not be easy, English.

02:26.079 --> 02:33.088
<i>Our purpose here is simple.
To strengthen what is weak.</i>

02:35.622 --> 02:38.535
<i>Make hard what is soft.</i>

02:52.172 --> 02:55.381
<i>This will take time.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:05.027
Mind must be master of the body.

03:07.954 --> 03:13.529
<i>Strong mind can separate the body
from its suffering.</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:18.809
Good concentration, English.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.370
Sorry? Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

03:27.808 --> 03:30.049
<i>You are not young.</i>

03:31.645 --> 03:36.219
<i>But with age comes wisdom.</i>

03:56.336 --> 04:00.045
<i>When mind
is master of the body,</i>

04:00.941 --> 04:03.751
<i>you will be warrior once more.</i>

04:10.951 --> 04:13.864
Master, what is my destiny?

04:15.756 --> 04:19.761
I'm in touch with a higher power.

04:29.736 --> 04:35.243
MI7 wants you on
the first flight back to London

04:41.148 --> 04:45.255
Master, am I ready?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.892
No.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.627
Window seat or aisle?

05:48.615 --> 05:50.959
One moment, please.
Good morning, sir.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.361
Toshiba British Intelligence.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.967
For electronic products press one.
To speak to an agent, press two.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.339
Certainly, sir.
Can I redirect you to our website?

06:01.394 --> 06:04.898
www.spyingforyou.gov.uk.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.568
Toshiba British Intelligence.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.578
Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.639
Johnny English.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.216
Pegasus is expecting you.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.043
Look into the camera.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.986
Don't smile.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.232
Pamela Thornton, Head of Ml?

06:30.423 --> 06:32.164
Johnny English.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.832
Have a seat.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.738
You've been away for some time, English.

06:39.599 --> 06:42.011
But you haven't been forgotten.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.611
Come on.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.076
People here often talk about
your adventures in Mozambique.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.690
Well, Ml? has come a long way since then

06:55.749 --> 06:59.959
The guns, the fast cars, and the
chauvinism are all on their way out.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.128
Frankly, I didn't want to see you back.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.202
You are everything
I came into this service to change.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.374
But my hands are tied.

07:11.464 --> 07:15.207
And there are times when one
has to go against one's better judgement.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.116
We have a situation.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.878
Indeed.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.317
There's a good puss. There's a good puss.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.124
There's a good pussy. Who's a good pussy?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.564
- I'm impressed.
- Who's a good pussy?

07:36.656 --> 07:39.136
Philby never lets strangers pick him up.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.069
I'm very much atone
with the animal kingdom.

07:42.228 --> 07:47.143
There's a good puss. I know,
I know. Who's lovely? Who's lovely?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.909
Who...

07:53.573 --> 07:57.487
We're all lovely.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.084
Kate Sumner, our behavioural psychologist.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.751
I've heard a great deal about you.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.694
Glowing reports, I trust.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.990
Tell me, Ms Sumner,

08:09.189 --> 08:13.262
what exactly does
a behavioural psychologist do?

08:13.326 --> 08:17.706
Monitor observable behaviour
for signs of internal psychology.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.610
We read people.

08:21.601 --> 08:26.107
Well, we must get together sometime.
I think you'll find me a real page-turner.

08:35.615 --> 08:36.684
Ah.

08:39.719 --> 08:43.394
So, Pegasus, this situation.

08:44.124 --> 08:48.630
Ex-CIA agent Titus Fisher
has contacted us from Hong Kong.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.966
He has intelligence of a plot
to assassinate the Chinese Premier

08:52.032 --> 08:54.069
at the Anglo-Chinese talks next week.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.638
We need you to go and find out
what he's got.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.817
Well, in that case, Pegasus, count me in.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.814
Agent One will meet you downstairs.

09:10.817 --> 09:14.560
So, I just scaled the walls,
blew the whole place to kingdom come.

09:14.654 --> 09:18.158
An hour later I'm sitting in the bar
with a White Russian in my hand.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.402
Who was very lovely, too, I can tell you.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.598
Simon.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.277
Hello, Johnny!

09:29.536 --> 09:31.038
Simon,

09:31.504 --> 09:33.711
you look wonderful.
But, then, you always did.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.109
Welcome back. How long has it been?

09:36.209 --> 09:40.419
I don't know. Five years, three months
and six days, or something.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.015
Of course, Mozambique.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.198
That was a balls-up with a cherry on top.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.058
Come on, let's get you sorted.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.034
Welcome to the toy cupboard.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.545
I won't leave you my number.

10:06.639 --> 10:07.743
You know Patch.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.718
Patch Quartermain, the man himself.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.811
English.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.049
Please, don't get up.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.486
No chance of that.

10:16.583 --> 10:20.087
Lost them testing the
B-6 exploding brogues.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.723
Oh, I'm so sorry. How are you?

10:23.389 --> 10:24.595
Have to be this one, I'm afraid.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.596
Lost this to the D-10 doorbell.

10:28.728 --> 10:32.403
Ah. Well, it's great to
see what's left of you

10:32.932 --> 10:36.846
This is rather good fun, actually.
Top speed of 60 mph,

10:36.936 --> 10:40.110
and I've managed to add the odd thing.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.753
This way. I haven't got all day.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.924
Don't!

10:49.516 --> 10:51.462
Would you stop meddling, English?

10:51.584 --> 10:52.995
Here she is.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.760
Ah, the Rolls-Royce Phantom.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.195
Truly the Rolls-Royce of automobiles.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.865
Armour plating, all the bells and whistles.
Say "Bonnet."

11:03.863 --> 11:05.638
<i>- Bonnet.
- Command accepted.</i>

11:07.300 --> 11:09.302
Voice activation recognises only you.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.305
Rolls has fitted
one of their experimental engines.

11:12.438 --> 11:16.614
The nine-litre V16. Goes like the wind.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.386
Only quieter.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.720
Beautiful.

11:21.948 --> 11:22.983
Keep up!

11:23.449 --> 11:25.622
Here's what you'll be taking to Hong Kong.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.796
- Ah, yes.
- A satellite receiver,

11:28.888 --> 11:32.131
tracking device, Semtex chewing gum.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.329
Now, what did I just say?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.975
That's the new P-two digital dart gun.

11:41.167 --> 11:47.243
Gentlemen. May I remind you all that MI7's
current weapon of choice is dialogue?

11:48.174 --> 11:50.654
We do love it when you get strict, Pegasus.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.657
English, you go to Hong Kong tonight.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.819
Fisher will contact you there.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.489
To ensure protocol is observed,

12:03.489 --> 12:06.026
I'm sending someone with you.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.194
Agent Tucker.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.533
It will be an honour, sir.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.670
Well, it'll be good
to have somebody to carry the bags.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.442
You made a laughing stock
out of this service once, English.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.350
Not on my watch. Clear'?

12:24.944 --> 12:26.218
Crystal clear, Pegasus.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.397
Just like old times, eh, Johnny?

12:36.522 --> 12:38.934
I'm off to Switzerland.
Let's catch up when you get back.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.130
There's nothing I'd like more, Simon.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.374
Has anyone seen
the voice-changing travel lozenges?

12:49.769 --> 12:50.873
Um...

12:52.105 --> 12:55.552
No. No.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.272
Come on, Tucker.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.782
I'm not 21 till September, sir.
I'm not really allowed in.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.789
Tucker, you're an agent working for
Her Majesty's Secret Service.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.620
Just act the part.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.105
Ten thousand dollars' worth,
please, my lovely.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.274
Thank you.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.340
And a receipt, please.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.321
Be alert for contact, Tucker.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.227
We're looking for
a Chinese man in spectacles.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.160
Would you like another drink, sir?

14:15.021 --> 14:18.468
Sir, the Chinese man in spectacles.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.462
- One more beer.
- No more bets, please.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.299
Contact.

14:33.806 --> 14:34.978
Evening.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.936
Your grandmother is sick.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.168
What?

15:00.166 --> 15:03.545
Your grandmother is sick.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.673
Well, she's dead. That's how sick she is.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.795
Is he dead, sir?

15:18.885 --> 15:20.865
Yes.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.386
<i>- Hi, Mum.
- What's the matter?</i>

15:50.450 --> 15:52.259
No, no, no, no. Nothing's the matter, no.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.559
I felt a bit funny last
night, but I'm okay now.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.601
So, what have you got for us?

16:02.962 --> 16:09.072
The people behind the plot to kill Xiang Ping,
the Chinese Premier. A group called Vortex.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.406
Never heard of them.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.074
Paid assassins. The best there is.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.285
Come on, Fisher, I need names,
I need evidence!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.695
Vortex has a secret weapon.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.531
This is one of three keys that,

16:32.792 --> 16:35.671
when used together, gain access to it.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.799
Without this, Vortex is finished

16:39.265 --> 16:41.302
How did you get hold of it?

16:41.367 --> 16:43.779
It's mine.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.176
I beg your pardon?

16:45.471 --> 16:48.384
Vortex is three of us.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.792
Come off it, Fisher

16:54.981 --> 17:00.863
<i>You, a hired assassin?
You couldn't hit a barn door with a banana</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:04.223
And as for Vortex,

17:04.323 --> 17:07.065
clearly you got the name
off a box of washing powder.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.367
Vortex was in Mozambique.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.701
What?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.367
Yeah? Really?

17:16.402 --> 17:19.178
Mum? Mum, Mum, I gotta go. Gotta go.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.715
We were all there
that day, Johnny-boy.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.546
- Excuse me. Sir!
- What?

17:26.579 --> 17:27.683
Sir, there's a...

17:28.013 --> 17:30.426
Quick, come on! Come on!

17:42.995 --> 17:44.668
Madam, let me help you with that.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.606
Here. Yes, I think you
should vacate the area.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.681
There are some
very dangerous people about.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.079
There we go.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.386
Get after her, Tucker, get after her!

18:11.591 --> 18:13.127
What?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.645
Sir! Sir!

18:27.740 --> 18:29.413
Over here, Tucker!

18:29.475 --> 18:30.783
I lost her, sir.

18:30.876 --> 18:33.117
Look what I found.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.423
This way, sir! This way!

18:41.220 --> 18:44.463
You get down to the street.
I'll take the roof.

19:20.826 --> 19:25.673
<i>You are not young.
But with age comes wisdom.</i>

20:46.946 --> 20:49.256
Hand it over, chimp.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.519
Come on, Tucker.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.285
Can I help?

21:56.348 --> 21:58.760
I am commandeering this vessel
in the name of Her Majesty.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.488
Right-0, Wing Commander.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.691
How exciting!

22:21.674 --> 22:24.484
Now, what's your poison?
Can I get you something?

22:26.312 --> 22:28.986
We've got vodka, rum.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.389
Your safety is our priority.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.863
But you can help us by familiarizing
yourself with this leaflet.

22:41.493 --> 22:45.805
Créme de menthe, a smidgen of port,
and that's about it, I'm afraid.

22:49.501 --> 22:50.844
I'm Shirley.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.739
Hello, Shirley.

22:56.375 --> 23:00.653
Just a tad to your left, Shirley.
Thank you.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.232
I say, Wing Commander!

24:24.630 --> 24:27.975
- Well played, sir! Well played!
- Just like a gladiator!

24:53.025 --> 24:56.029
Come on. Put 'em up.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.961
Well played, sir! Well played!

25:45.177 --> 25:46.713
More champagne, my lovely.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.086
Certainly, sir.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.421
Tucker' are you sure
you don't want a Shandy or something?

25:50.516 --> 25:53.827
I have got to finish this
mission report, sir.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.526
And Pegasus wants to see us
as soon as we touchdown.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.434
The mission report?

25:59.658 --> 26:01.865
Oh, come on, Tucker. Live a little.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.672
You should learn to savour success.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.506
Work hard,

26:08.434 --> 26:11.506
play hard. Isn't that right...

26:12.738 --> 26:13.842
Barbara?

26:31.056 --> 26:33.593
Vortex is finished

26:34.359 --> 26:36.032
But better still,

26:36.095 --> 26:39.804
for years I believed what happened
in Mozambique was my fault.

26:40.766 --> 26:44.737
Now I realise it was only partly my fault.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.873
What did happen in Mozambique?

26:59.084 --> 27:03.897
Excuse me, sir. We're coming in to land.
Can I stow that overhead for you?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.162
Certainly.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.935
Sir, I don't think he's a "Susan."

27:11.296 --> 27:14.334
But then you're not a linguist,
are you, Tucker'?

27:14.433 --> 27:18.643
It's not "Susan," it's "Shoooshan."

27:18.804 --> 27:23.184
From the Xinzhou region,
unless I'm very much mistaken.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.783
Thank you, Shoooshan.

27:40.425 --> 27:43.133
Foreign Secretary.

27:43.195 --> 27:46.369
I hope you've got something
for us, English.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.604
The Prime Minister is extremely concerned.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.806
He has every reason to be so.

27:51.136 --> 27:54.208
There is a plot to kill
the Chinese Premier.

27:54.306 --> 27:58.812
Masterminded by a group of
ruthless assassins called Vortex.

27:59.811 --> 28:00.949
Good Lord.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.017
The danger, however, has been averted.

28:04.983 --> 28:08.362
Now that we have this.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.697
- English?
- Now, I know what you're going to say,

28:17.296 --> 28:20.300
it's a pretty small object

28:21.733 --> 28:25.909
Well, it's often the little things
that pack the biggest punch.

28:26.004 --> 28:29.679
- After all, David killed Goliath with a pebble.
- Sir.

28:30.542 --> 28:35.855
The mighty Vortex has been slain
by my possession of this small key.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.613
Shoooshan.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.877
Susan.

29:09.681 --> 29:12.252
We got it, but Fisher talked.

29:14.920 --> 29:18.094
Understood. We'll deal with English.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.439
You've got some more cleaning to do.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.873
Mummy, Mummy! Mr Rhubarb's here!

29:29.701 --> 29:33.945
Izzie, darling, why don't you
show him into the conservatory?

29:34.039 --> 29:35.211
I'll be with you in just a minute.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.811
Okay. Come on, come on, let's go!

29:37.909 --> 29:39.820
- Shall we?
- Hurry up, Mr Rhubarb

29:40.245 --> 29:44.455
Perhaps when you've found your key,
you'll give me a call.

29:44.549 --> 29:48.554
I'm very sorry, Foreign Secretary.
I had hoped to have more for you.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.964
Oh, God.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.935
Pegasus! I've got her!

30:26.625 --> 30:27.695
Come on, you witch.

30:27.793 --> 30:28.828
English?

30:28.927 --> 30:32.465
She was in Hong Kong! She's the killer!

30:32.597 --> 30:34.099
She's my mother!

30:36.601 --> 30:37.841
Couldn't she be both?

30:42.441 --> 30:44.819
Mummy, Mummy, are you all right?

30:45.777 --> 30:47.814
Let me get you a cup of tea.

30:50.816 --> 30:53.456
- You'll be fine, Mummy.
- Who was that man?

30:54.019 --> 30:58.331
Yeah, I think a cup of tea,
that's what's required.

31:03.628 --> 31:06.734
Pegasus, I am truly, truly sorry.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.676
Don't apologise to me. Apologise to her.

31:21.380 --> 31:26.989
I cannot apologise enough, Mrs Pegasus.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.667
It was a simple case of mistaken identity,
I'm afraid.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.836
Now, I completely understand

31:33.892 --> 31:35.838
how upset you are,
but I was hoping perhaps...

31:41.833 --> 31:42.903
Sir!

31:43.235 --> 31:47.615
Tucker! That's her!
It's the killer from Hong Kong!

31:47.706 --> 31:50.448
- No, it's not her, sir.
- It is! This time it's really her!

31:50.542 --> 31:53.523
- It's not her, sir!
- Yes, it is!

32:01.019 --> 32:02.362
Make way!

32:02.854 --> 32:04.197
Sir.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.362
You murderous crone!

32:09.528 --> 32:12.031
Granny! What's he doing?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.072
Take that! And that!

32:15.867 --> 32:17.710
Hey! Stop it.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.240
English!

32:22.240 --> 32:24.720
I've got her this time, Pegasus!

32:25.544 --> 32:29.082
This is the witch who works for Vortex!

32:29.214 --> 32:31.592
Want any more' you old hag?

32:31.716 --> 32:33.457
- English!
- Granny!

32:44.062 --> 32:46.668
You humiliate me
in front of the Foreign Secretary,

32:46.765 --> 32:50.235
you lose our only lead on Vortex,
and then you try and kill my mother!

32:51.303 --> 32:52.577
Twice!

32:53.572 --> 32:57.110
Pegasus, we have another lead.
Vortex was in Mozambique!

32:57.242 --> 33:00.451
They were responsible
for the death of President Chambal!

33:00.579 --> 33:04.584
No! You were responsible
for the death of President Chambal.

33:16.294 --> 33:19.298
Well, you certainly gave Mr Rhubarb
a run for his money.

33:21.166 --> 33:25.774
Still, at least we know Vortex
was in Mozambique.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.713
When you told Pegasus,

33:28.807 --> 33:32.016
you displayed all four indicators
of someone telling the truth.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.992
This is a facial action
coding system.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.159
Its high-speed cameras
record microexpressions,

33:46.291 --> 33:47.827
invisible to the naked eye.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.166
It detects what we call emotional leakage.

33:50.295 --> 33:54.175
Ms Sumner, I'm a trained agent.
I don't "leak."

33:54.566 --> 33:57.308
I want to take you back to Mozambique.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.411
Is that really necessary?

34:02.741 --> 34:03.981
Take a look at this.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.917
<i>I want to take you
back to Mozambique.</i>

34:10.748 --> 34:12.387
There.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.657
Could we call that leakage?

34:14.985 --> 34:19.331
Now, play ball.
I'm taking a risk being here after hours.

34:19.925 --> 34:23.202
If Vortex was in Mozambique,
perhaps you saw something.

34:23.328 --> 34:26.206
I'm going to take you back there
using hypnosis.

34:26.331 --> 34:29.777
Oh, please.
Spare me the new age mumbo jumbo.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.871
Mr English' please. I'm a professional.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.415
I'm not going to just snap my fingers

34:34.505 --> 34:38.351
and make you say the first thing
that comes into your head.

34:38.443 --> 34:39.945
Plump pillows.

34:40.045 --> 34:41.717
Excuse me?

34:41.846 --> 34:45.589
Brilliant mind. Beautiful face.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.027
Incredible.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.690
And completely out of my league.

34:53.123 --> 34:54.467
Mmm.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.907
I'd like to take you back to Mozambique.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.713
Tell me what's happening, Johnny.
Where are you?

35:08.807 --> 35:11.651
<i>President Chambal's
inauguration day.</i>

35:12.310 --> 35:15.052
<i>Yes, you're head of security.</i>

35:17.716 --> 35:19.753
<i>Everything's going perfectly.</i>

35:19.884 --> 35:22.057
<i>Today we climb the mountain!</i>

35:22.220 --> 35:23.995
Agent English.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.894
<i>The people
have spoken, and the message is clear.</i>

35:31.262 --> 35:33.401
<i>A future of peace and prosperity!</i>

35:33.498 --> 35:36.672
The backup electrical supply has been cut.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.941
No, it hasn't. It's been turned off.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.945
Do you know how to turn it on?

35:47.779 --> 35:49.918
I should be getting back.

35:51.249 --> 35:54.253
Well, operations like this
are always difficult.

35:54.352 --> 35:56.423
But it's very satisfying
when you get a result.

35:56.521 --> 35:59.331
The President couldn't be in safer hands.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.961
<i>The future belongs to Mozambique!</i>

36:02.927 --> 36:04.099
<i>Thank you.</i>

36:05.630 --> 36:07.940
The fireworks have begun.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.140
The sound of freedom and celebration.

36:18.777 --> 36:23.658
Easy, Johnny. Easy. Go back.
Before the Jacuzzi, what did you see?

36:29.287 --> 36:30.789
Yes.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.166
Fisher.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.303
On the terrace with two others.

36:37.395 --> 36:41.468
Yes. All three members of Vortex
were there that day.

36:41.566 --> 36:44.911
Who can you see?
Who can you see, Johnny?

36:47.739 --> 36:50.686
<i>Artem Karlenko.</i>

36:53.978 --> 36:56.481
<i>Artem Karlenko, double agent.</i>

36:56.581 --> 36:59.323
<i>Recruited by MI7 in Moscow.</i>

36:59.584 --> 37:02.656
<i>Retired after his penchant for
killing people threatened his cover.</i>

37:03.588 --> 37:05.659
Five years ago, he turned up here

37:06.324 --> 37:08.326
as Sergei Pudovkin.

37:08.426 --> 37:10.201
Rich, very rich.

37:10.328 --> 37:12.399
A member of the exclusive
Oakwood Golf Club,

37:12.497 --> 37:13.874
<i>which is where you'll
be meeting him.</i>

37:13.998 --> 37:16.672
He's in a match play competition, sir.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.679
I'm making you his opponent for the day.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.016
Done it, sir.
You're booked in as Mr Peter Adams.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.091
Thank you, Tucker.

37:30.248 --> 37:35.027
If Karlenko is Vortex,
I want you to bring him in. Alive.

38:00.478 --> 38:02.480
Mr Pussykin?

38:02.881 --> 38:06.624
Pudovkin. And you must be Mr

38:09.053 --> 38:10.054
Um...

38:10.822 --> 38:12.392
Adams.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.227
Beautiful car, Mr Adams.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.130
Ah, the Royce.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.298
<i>Ready, sir.</i>

38:19.063 --> 38:20.235
Thank you.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.401
Shall we?

38:23.067 --> 38:24.239
Let's go.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.747
<i>Command accepted.</i>

38:27.138 --> 38:30.483
So, what line of business are you in,
Mr Adams?

38:30.575 --> 38:31.747
Pudovkin.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.318
Sorry. Yes, I'm Mr Adams, and you're Mr...

38:35.413 --> 38:37.916
Whoever you said you were

38:38.016 --> 38:39.927
- Well...
- Stop!

38:42.754 --> 38:45.928
Sorry, I thought I had forgotten something.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.795
Glove, sir'?

39:15.286 --> 39:17.129
I may not know much about golf, Tucker,

39:17.188 --> 39:19.725
but I know how to hold the bat.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.662
Shot, sir.

40:01.933 --> 40:05.403
So, what line of business
are you in, Mr Puddykin?

40:05.503 --> 40:08.575
I made my money
in the removals business.

40:10.742 --> 40:15.191
A friend of mine had shares
in a removals business. Titus Fisher.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.954
You haven't come across him at all?

40:18.917 --> 40:22.126
I warn you, Mr Adams,
not to stray into the rough.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.032
You get in there, you might never come out.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.194
I'll bear that in mind, Mr Puddykin.

40:27.292 --> 40:30.102
Pudovkin. Please.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.216
Shot!

40:46.077 --> 40:48.717
As was my friend Fisher, actually.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.655
In the back.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.820
By his cleaner, of all people.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.101
But they didn't take much.

41:05.763 --> 41:06.833
Just a key

41:14.772 --> 41:16.479
Break, left to right, I think.

41:16.574 --> 41:17.780
Thank you.

41:41.265 --> 41:42.767
In the trees.

41:46.704 --> 41:48.183
Come on.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.620
- Oh, my God.
- He can't die. He mustn't die.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.714
Let's get him out of here. Come on!
Come on.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.121
He's not looking good, sir.

42:01.319 --> 42:04.892
We're getting you to a doctor.
You'll be fine.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.362
You do know how to fly these, sir?

42:08.459 --> 42:10.700
- It was part of basic training.
- Good.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.638
It's just like riding a bike.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.476
Yes. It's all coming back to me.

42:43.261 --> 42:47.266
This is helicopter
Golf Hotel Zulu Zulu Tango.

42:47.365 --> 42:50.778
We have a casualty on board.
Request guidance to nearest hospital.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.176
<i>Where's your exact location?</i>

42:52.236 --> 42:53.613
Our location? Location?

42:54.238 --> 42:58.050
She shot out the navigation system.
Hang on.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.430
- Runstock.
- Our location is Runstock.

43:11.522 --> 43:12.626
<i>What is your altitude?</i>

43:12.723 --> 43:14.600
What's our altitude?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.464
About 18 inches.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.577
Hello? Hello?

43:24.302 --> 43:26.248
Sorry. I'll just move.

43:28.239 --> 43:29.877
What now, sir'?

43:29.941 --> 43:33.548
We'll have to stick to the road.
Let's follow the 1328.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.147
There's bound to be a hospital in Dingham.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.057
Look after him, Tucker. Look after him.

43:50.928 --> 43:53.738
- I think we're losing him, sir.
- We can't lose him, Tucker.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.439
He's our only lead. Try something else.

44:03.074 --> 44:06.578
<i>Don't give up on us, baby</i>

44:06.644 --> 44:12.651
<i>Lord knows we've come this far</i>

44:17.588 --> 44:23.834
<i>We are
The angel and the dreamer</i>

44:27.365 --> 44:30.175
<i>Don'! give up on us, I know</i>

44:30.768 --> 44:34.272
<i>We could still come through</i>

44:50.154 --> 44:53.192
Look, sir! Follow that ambulance!

44:53.291 --> 44:54.793
Good idea.

45:05.403 --> 45:07.178
Sir. Sir, quickly.

45:10.741 --> 45:13.187
Karlenko. Karlenko!

45:20.384 --> 45:22.091
The second key.

45:23.654 --> 45:28.569
Vortex is KGB...

45:29.427 --> 45:31.998
- Yes.
- CIA.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.577
Yes? Yes?

45:42.073 --> 45:43.552
MI7.

45:52.183 --> 45:57.132
Unbelievable. A vole in MI7.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.566
A mole, sir.

46:02.526 --> 46:03.869
What?

46:04.295 --> 46:06.468
There's a mole in MI7.

46:07.632 --> 46:09.703
There's a mole and a vole?

46:10.301 --> 46:13.748
No, sir. There's a mole, not a vole.

46:14.472 --> 46:16.918
Well, I disagree. There's certainly a vole.

46:16.974 --> 46:18.749
I mean, we know that much.

46:18.809 --> 46:22.416
But what you're saying is
there might be a mole as well.

46:24.248 --> 46:25.454
Pegasus.

46:26.917 --> 46:30.626
There's a meeting at MI7
with the Prime Minister.

46:36.227 --> 46:40.004
And here again, eyes down
and to the left, indicating dissent.

46:40.097 --> 46:42.338
With Xiang Ping, it's all about the eyes.

46:42.433 --> 46:45.141
Thank you, Ms Sumner.
If the talks go ahead, I'd like you with us.

46:46.737 --> 46:48.410
Yes, Prime Minister.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.344
Good evening, gentlemen.

46:51.442 --> 46:52.853
- Mr English.
- Ms Sumner.

46:55.613 --> 46:56.819
Right.

46:58.149 --> 47:02.461
So when is the Prime Minister
going to grace us with his presence?

47:02.820 --> 47:04.595
I'm the Prime Minister.

47:04.689 --> 47:06.635
Yeah, you wish.

47:17.301 --> 47:19.542
All right. So we're all here.

47:22.173 --> 47:26.121
These talks with China
are of paramount importance.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.520
Rogue slates in Southeast Asia

47:27.611 --> 47:29.887
have begun secretly to develop
nuclear weapons.

47:29.980 --> 47:32.859
It is vital that we get China onside.

47:32.950 --> 47:35.794
Traditionally, China has been
impervious to our concerns,

47:35.853 --> 47:38.129
but I believe Xiang Ping,
given the opportunity,

47:38.189 --> 47:41.830
can and will help defuse this situation.

47:41.959 --> 47:44.371
Well,
with his pro-West stance,

47:44.462 --> 47:46.237
it certainly offers an opportunity,

47:46.330 --> 47:50.301
but the talks can't go ahead
unless we can guarantee his safety.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.405
I believe, with the correct security,
that we can.

47:52.503 --> 47:55.575
If Vortex is operational
it's just too dangerous

47:55.673 --> 47:58.552
I'm inclined to agree, Prime Minister.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.186
There is a way.

48:03.214 --> 48:06.525
The Swiss are willing
to lend us Le Bastion.

48:06.650 --> 48:08.823
That's their government
fortress in the Alps.

48:09.220 --> 48:13.726
It's a stunning example of
architectural engineering at altitude,

48:13.824 --> 48:16.668
and completely impregnable.

48:16.727 --> 48:20.197
I mean, that should solve
all our security issues.

48:20.998 --> 48:22.841
Then the talks go ahead.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.880
Pamela, I hope you've brushed up
on your Mandarin.

48:25.002 --> 48:28.779
I'd like you in the room with me,
and your best man on security.

48:28.873 --> 48:30.716
Yes, Prime Minister.

48:32.676 --> 48:35.020
Where are we on Vortex?

48:36.180 --> 48:37.250
English?

48:37.882 --> 48:42.888
Vortex is three men.
Fisher was one, Karlenko was another.

48:43.020 --> 48:46.900
Karlenko was killed today
on the orders of the third.

48:48.092 --> 48:49.571
Any leads?

48:49.693 --> 48:51.866
Yes, but I need time.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.772
We do not have time.

48:53.864 --> 48:58.040
We need to know the identity
of the third person in Vortex.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.049
Give me 24 hours.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.130
Another bottle of Romaine-Conti?

49:19.056 --> 49:20.967
Of course.
And would you like to choose dessert?

49:21.058 --> 49:23.095
Yes. You.

49:24.929 --> 49:27.102
And bring two spoons.

49:31.902 --> 49:33.643
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

49:34.071 --> 49:35.744
Cheers.

49:37.908 --> 49:41.253
So, come on, Johnny,
what was it you wanted to ask me'?

49:45.783 --> 49:50.163
Simon, do you know what this is?

49:53.924 --> 49:55.801
Some sort of key?

49:55.926 --> 50:01.433
Karlenko and Fisher both had one,
and they were both killed for them.

50:02.333 --> 50:06.713
Well, I'll give it to the boys
at the lab and see...

50:06.804 --> 50:13.153
Karlenko told me that the third man
in Vortex is in MI7.

50:19.683 --> 50:23.324
And you believed him?

50:23.988 --> 50:30.496
Simon, I have to ask you a question,
face to face.

50:32.796 --> 50:37.142
Do you have any idea who it might be?

50:39.837 --> 50:43.307
Johnny, I thought
you were about to accuse me.

50:43.374 --> 50:44.819
No! I mean, honestly.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.819
- What?
- Simon Ambrose, the evil mastermind!

50:48.879 --> 50:50.825
- Don't. Stop it-
- The traitor in our midst!

50:50.881 --> 50:52.326
You! You!

50:54.018 --> 50:55.691
Simon, you are so funny.

50:57.087 --> 50:58.498
Hysterical.

50:59.823 --> 51:01.029
Oh, dear.

51:04.595 --> 51:07.201
Would you excuse me
for one moment, Simon?

51:21.178 --> 51:23.249
- Sir.
- Tucker, can'! this wait?

51:23.347 --> 51:25.054
Sir, it's Ambrose.

51:25.683 --> 51:27.424
Yes, I know it's Ambrose.
I'm having dinner with him.

51:27.518 --> 51:30.192
No, he's the third man in Vortex.

51:31.889 --> 51:33.869
Simon Ambrose?

51:35.225 --> 51:37.364
He went to Eton.

51:39.697 --> 51:40.971
Simon.

51:41.065 --> 51:42.203
Leave it.

51:45.302 --> 51:46.372
- What are you...
- Move.

51:46.470 --> 51:48.575
- All right, all right.
- Come on, move.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.379
Tucker.

51:51.241 --> 51:54.745
- You said you never knew Karlenko.
- That's right.

51:54.878 --> 51:57.415
Then how do you explain these?

51:58.048 --> 52:02.053
I hacked into Karlenko's computer.
You and him in Mozambique?

52:30.180 --> 52:33.093
Sometimes I have trouble myself, old boy.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.612
You're Vortex!
You're the third man in Vortex!

52:53.704 --> 52:54.876
Tucker, this is ridiculous.

52:56.140 --> 52:58.051
Sorry, I'll be with you in just a tick.

52:58.375 --> 53:00.116
It's true, I was in Mozambique.

53:01.045 --> 53:02.319
What?

53:02.780 --> 53:06.125
I was there because of Patch Quartermain.

53:06.183 --> 53:10.029
Patch? Sorry, I'll just be one second.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.999
He's the man you're after.

53:13.490 --> 53:15.629
- You're bluffing!
- Sorry.

53:15.693 --> 53:19.038
I work for a secret organisation inside MI7

53:19.129 --> 53:21.837
set up specifically to bring him in.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.680
A secret Secret Service?

53:24.802 --> 53:27.180
Yeah? What's it called?

53:27.805 --> 53:29.807
What's it called?

53:31.642 --> 53:32.985
Armitage.

53:33.210 --> 53:36.817
A secret secret secret service
called Armitage?

53:37.214 --> 53:39.524
We answer only to the PM.

53:41.852 --> 53:44.162
It's extraordinary, Simon...

53:44.688 --> 53:46.031
Indeed, it is.

53:46.156 --> 53:49.365
...That you'd think for one moment

53:49.493 --> 53:54.567
that I would fall for
such a steaming pile of old baloney.

53:54.665 --> 53:57.908
Well done, Tucker.
You're not Spy of the Month for nothing.

53:58.001 --> 54:01.210
- Thank you, sir.
- Here, let me take that.

54:01.338 --> 54:02.544
Now go home.

54:03.674 --> 54:06.621
- What?
- You're the one talking baloney.

54:06.710 --> 54:09.520
You're in way over your head, boy.
Now run along.

54:09.580 --> 54:13.050
No! I won't go, sir. He's lying.

54:13.183 --> 54:16.460
You've let me down,
you've let the Service down

54:16.553 --> 54:18.624
and, frankly,
I think you've let yourself down.

54:18.722 --> 54:21.396
- But I...
- Now get out!

54:26.263 --> 54:31.406
Patch Quartermain, of all people.
Blowing his own legs off?

54:31.535 --> 54:34.539
Now that's what I call deep cover.

54:34.605 --> 54:36.448
And to think how much I admired him.

54:36.540 --> 54:37.610
He hates you.

54:38.575 --> 54:40.885
- Really?
- He always has.

54:40.944 --> 54:44.255
He thinks you're a moron
with no place in MI7,

54:44.381 --> 54:48.955
a jumped-up grammar school nobody
That's why he tried to destroy you.

54:50.954 --> 54:54.834
Now, Johnny,
just because he ruined your life,

54:54.925 --> 54:57.769
that's no reason for you to go rogue
and take him down on your own.

55:00.430 --> 55:04.071
God forbid I should put a crazy idea
like that in your head.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.078
Good night, Simon.

55:09.139 --> 55:13.610
Johnny, that key you showed me.
We might need it to bring him in.

55:19.583 --> 55:21.995
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

55:23.620 --> 55:24.997
Silly tit.

55:29.927 --> 55:31.133
Bingo.

55:33.764 --> 55:35.766
- Arrange a meeting with our client
- Of course.

55:49.179 --> 55:50.624
Pegasus.

55:51.815 --> 55:53.624
We have the third man.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.300
It's Johnny English.

56:09.132 --> 56:10.634
Hello, Patch.

56:11.301 --> 56:13.372
Looking for forgiveness?

56:15.639 --> 56:20.486
It's all over for you now, English.
It's the end of the line.

56:20.978 --> 56:23.584
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Patch?

56:23.680 --> 56:27.992
After all, I'm just a jumped-up
grammar school nobody, aren't I?

56:28.518 --> 56:30.020
What are you talking about?

56:31.321 --> 56:36.703
I know that you are the
third man in Vortex.

56:40.330 --> 56:43.038
No, Johnny. You are.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.679
No, you are.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.511
No. You are!

56:49.339 --> 56:51.512
Standby, all agents.

56:51.575 --> 56:53.851
And it all ends here.

56:58.882 --> 57:00.054
<i>Take him.</i>

57:43.393 --> 57:44.736
Johnny.

57:56.807 --> 57:57.945
Hey! Watch it!

58:00.911 --> 58:02.948
Got him! Move! Move!

58:04.581 --> 58:06.117
Don't lose him. Go, go!

58:06.283 --> 58:07.421
Halt!

58:21.298 --> 58:24.336
Heading west into Vine Street.
Mobilise all vehicles.

59:01.471 --> 59:02.472
Idiot!

59:10.547 --> 59:13.391
You've lost him! I don't believe it.

59:27.364 --> 59:29.844
Oi! Who do you think you are?

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:09.778
Gotcha.

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:43.077
<i>Agent English, pull over! Pullover!</i>

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.271
Stop ii!

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:16.477
Get after him.

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:38.966
Kate, Kate, I'm not Vortex.
I've been framed.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.374
You must believe me.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.534
<i>How will it be done?</i>

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:18.603
Same as in Mozambique.
One person, apparently working alone.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.413
Who have you chosen?

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:23.676
Leave that with me.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:31.582
My account in Zurich.
500 million US dollars, as agreed.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.607
You've been out for hours

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:03.718
Well, you're lucky it
was just a flesh wound.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.160
Now, look, I'm going to Switzerland tonight,
but you can stay here while I'm gone.

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:09.955
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:14.331
I've been going through the news footage
from the night Chambal was killed.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.329
And there's something not right.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.600
Seconds after President Chambal was shot,

01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:22.007
the assassin collapses and dies.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:25.341
And the autopsy says heart failure.

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:30.475
But, if you go through
the classified CCTV footage...

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.413
You all right?

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.583
Yeah, fine.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:40.686
Take a look at this.

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:46.994
Fifteen minutes before
the assassination, look, he's manic.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.764
He's completely lost control of his body

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.830
And then, suddenly, catatonic.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.970
Here, wait.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.507
There.

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:02.143
Someone was talking to him.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:09.788
I don't think he had any idea
what he was doing.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.349
I think Vortex's secret weapon...

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:16.359
Is a mind control drug.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:18.831
And only one fits the symptoms.

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:24.467
Timox... Timoxylin Bubby...

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.404
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:30.308
The CIA ordered its destruction
10 years ago.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.814
And the agent in charge of its disposal...

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.579
Titus Fisher.

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:42.983
I don't know how to thank you.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:45.826
I'd love a take-away.

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:48.857
Consider it done.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:52.833
Flying low.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:05.543
So, Johnny, what are you going to do
about Vortex'?

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:11.712
I don't know. If only Simon was here.
He'd know what to do.

01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:14.255
Why do you think he's better than you?

01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:16.880
Well, the man's a god.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.182
Well, I prefer mortals.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:24.792
Pure, complicated, maddening mortals.

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:29.295
I've come to realise
that what's really exciting to me

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:34.432
is great loyalty,
determination, and courage.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:39.106
You have always fascinated me, clinically.

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.944
But now you...

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:49.588
Ms Sumner, your pupils are dilating.

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.788
Are they?

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.786
Your cheeks are colouring.

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.428
Eye contact deepening.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.665
Heart-rate rising.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:08.932
Ms Sumner,
I believe we're emotionally leaking.

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:15.513
- The bedroom, quickly.
- Absolutely.

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:17.412
Now!

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.428
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.828
- Oh, Simon.
- Hi, Kate.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.957
You ready? I'll drive you to the airport.

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:35.662
How nice. I'll just get my bag.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:41.973
You alone?

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.839
- No.
- Of course.

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.105
Been working?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:48.945
Been brushing up
on the Chinese PM. You?

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.848
We're trying to track clown Johnny English

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:58.993
There's some questions
we want to ask him, about Vortex.

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.686
I don't suppose you've seen him, have you?

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:01.853
No.

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.962
Not hiding him away?

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:08.962
Not my type. Shall we?

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.160
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.404
Ambrose.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.804
There's a Mr Adams to see you, Colin.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:34.176
- Hello, Tucker.
- What are you doing here?

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:37.183
Every agent in the country is after you.

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:38.684
We were right about Ambrose

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:40.712
What do you mean "we"?

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.118
And if we can act fast, we can still...

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.453
You wouldn't listen, would you?

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:47.393
You think you know it all. Well' you don't!

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:50.292
Being an agent means everything to me.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.629
And, thanks to you, I'm suspended!

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.027
Would you boys like some orange squash?

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.002
- No, thank you.
- Bye, thanks, Mum.

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:05.477
Tucker, Ambrose is in Switzerland.
We are in Tooting.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.676
I am here because my country needs me.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.985
And because it needs you, too.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.938
<i>- Royce.
- Ready, sir.</i>

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.079
Come.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:46.111
<i>Obstruction detected.</i>

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:09.608
Set the sat nav for Switzerland
Let's kick some bottom.

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:44.907
<i>You have arrived at
your destination.</i>

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.743
<i>Good luck, sir!</i>

01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:01.421
Le Bastion. One way up, one way down.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:06.634
Come on. Let's get the stuff.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:15.371
Whoa, look. The T-2 ground-to-air missile!

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:19.106
That's a D-7 bulletproof shield.

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.041
Take it from me, Tucker.

01:12:21.137 --> 01:12:24.016
I was working with these
while you were stringing conkers.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.581
The P-8 grapple hook?

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.979
Check.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.747
- Estimated height?
- Thirty-five feet.

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.344
All yours, Tucker.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.253
Can I just say, sir'?

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.186
This is just great.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.561
Well, go on.

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:22.441
The D-16 ascender, and up we go.

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.868
Are you sure that's the ascender, sir?

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:26.538
Yes, yes, I'd know it anywhere.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:30.376
<i>Agent in distress.
Agent in distress.</i>

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:43.789
<i>Agent in distress.
Agent in distress.</i>

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.262
<i>I am over here!</i>

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.098
Shut up! Shut up!

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.035
<i>I am over here!</i>

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.714
<i>Activating visual locator.</i>

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.244
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:16.889
<i>Intruders in Sector Four!</i>

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:27.166
Dear God, let me not die
at the hands of the Swiss.

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:31.806
Tucker, now listen. I want you to attack me

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.505
- What?
- After a struggle,

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:37.414
you can "arrest me"
and take me inside as your prisoner.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.010
- Sir, I can't.
- Tucker, that's an order.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:43.790
Hit me. Hit me.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.150
Come on, harder.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.997
- Better, sh'?
- Yes, much better.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.636
I can see how people get a taste for this.

01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:00.437
I got a better idea. I'll shoot you!

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.169
No, no, no.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:04.300
- Die, Vortex scum!
- Tucker!

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.708
Agent Tucker!

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.679
It's Johnny English.

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.018
Bag him.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.644
The glass can withstand
mortar attack.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.983
The door's one-way.
You can get out, but no one gets in.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.347
Excellent.

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:50.752
You ready, Slater'?

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:00.160
I'll have them send refreshments
to your room

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.428
when you're ready, Pegasus.

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:03.094
Thank you, Agent One.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.572
I'll take it from here, boys.

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:19.116
Hold it right there!

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.886
Let me see your ID.

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:26.124
- Excuse me
- What the...

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:30.758
Stop!

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:34.968
Warning, this is a
designated conflict zone.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:46.206
Sir'? Sir?

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:06.496
- Thank you so much
- You're welcome, Pegasus.

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:08.464
Pegasus.

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:21.412
Go on. Go on.

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:30.486
What the hell is that?

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:40.295
Sir'? Sir?

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.300
- English!
- Pegasus.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.107
They're going to make you kill Xiang Ping!

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.472
You're insane!

01:17:52.535 --> 01:17:54.310
Agent One, thank God.

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:59.814
He won't help you.
He's the third member of Vortex.

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.855
Aren't you, Simon?

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.157
Here to give you some Timoxy bubby...

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:10.197
Timoxy bubby

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:14.562
Timoxy bubby...

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:22.037
To give you a drug that will make you
obey his every command.

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.482
I'm intrigued, Simon.

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:38.051
How exactly
were you going to administer it?

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:44.556
By injection?

01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:53.096
Some hideous gas through the air vents?

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:01.847
Or by spiking her drink?

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.511
Timoxeline Barbebutenol.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:16.259
He'll enter the manic phase
any moment now.

01:19:17.453 --> 01:19:20.525
I have to warn you that I've been
trained to resist this kind of thing.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.868
You swine.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:28.702
Agent One, what's going on?

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.370
He's quite harmless at this phase.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.709
The drug will kill him,
but just before it does,

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:37.113
there'll be a short window
where he'll do everything I tell him to.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.551
Poor Johnny.

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.624
You were never really Ml-7, Johnny.

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:51.959
You were never really one of us.

01:19:52.054 --> 01:19:55.399
Now you're about to become
our most famous agent.

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:07.069
You'll now do exactly as I tell you.

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:09.912
You are a traitor to the Service
and to your country.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.508
Shut her up, old chap.

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.249
- Duck.
- What?

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.582
I warned you.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:23.087
Okay, Slater. Let's get him ready.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:27.431
Ready.

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:31.204
Premier Ping,
it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:34.005
You had a pleasant flight, I trust?

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:37.434
I was just asking the Premier
if he had a pleasant flight.

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:42.438
Kate, Johnny's back on the team.

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:43.846
What?

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:46.510
It's all checked out and the PM
and the Chinese have approved it.

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.519
- Approved what?
- He's standing in for Pamela.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.681
Isn't it great?

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:04.568
Excuse me. Agent Tucker.

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:13.204
Good, good.
And your wife is well?

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:20.147
<i>Lock it up, Johnny.</i>

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:21.653
Wonderful.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:24.723
<i>That's it.</i>

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:38.763
Premier, I am most grateful you have
agreed to meet me at this time.

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.410
It is our pleasure.

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:49.577
Maintain that tone, Prime Minister.

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:51.446
Avoid confrontation, keep eye contact.

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:55.185
I can assure you that the Chinese people

01:21:55.277 --> 01:22:00.283
have always regarded the British
people as completely horrible.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.095
- Honourable.
- Honourable.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.532
Completely honourable.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:09.768
Of course.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.373
I was very keen to meet...

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:34.560
Johnny, stand up and go to the water table.

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:43.059
Premier,
I believe the present danger

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.899
can be averted if we act swiftly.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:47.064
Go to your right pocket.

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.803
We designed it for Pegasus.

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:55.575
Well, it's too bloody late now.

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:00.345
Just act natural.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.328
- Prime Minister, traditionally...
- Somethings wrong.

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.996
...China does not respond well to advice...

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:20.767
Pull out the barrel.

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:26.777
Now, Johnny, I want you to kill Xiang Ping.

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:31.881
Oh, dear God, no.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:36.021
He's being controlled.

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:37.556
By who?

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.523
Ambrose.

01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:41.993
Shoot Xiang Ping!

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:50.968
Mind must be master of the body.

01:23:54.296 --> 01:23:56.139
He's resisting it.

01:23:57.466 --> 01:24:00.640
His left hand is fighting the right hand.

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.977
Come on, Johnny.

01:24:08.010 --> 01:24:09.489
If I can interrupt the frequency,

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:11.524
I could stop Ambrose
from communicating with him.

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:30.704
English, stand up!

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.181
Come on. Come on.

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:47.389
He'll be dead in 50 seconds, sir.

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.391
Tucker!

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:53.359
Come on.

01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:56.131
- Pull the trigger!
- I'm in.

01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:19.158
Listen to me, this is Simon Ambrose,

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:22.057
<i>and I order you
to shoot Xiang Ping!</i>

01:25:25.921 --> 01:25:27.059
Ten seconds, sir.

01:25:29.558 --> 01:25:30.764
Fire!

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:43.141
Go, go, go.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.275
Time to get out of here.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:51.088
Hold your fire!

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.525
Stand down!

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:20.211
His pulse is dropping.

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:21.719
Don't lose him!

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:23.289
Come on, sir.

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:12.434
<i>Open your head, English,
and you shall be reborn.</i>

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:27.111
Almost there.

01:27:55.871 --> 01:27:57.475
Thank you, Kate.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.880
I was passing.

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:00.918
Sir.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.385
Tucker!

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:05.056
Welcome back, sir.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.450
Thank you, Tucker.

01:28:06.548 --> 01:28:07.925
I won't kiss you, if you don't mind.

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.722
Well, whatever.

01:28:13.722 --> 01:28:14.894
Where's Ambrose?

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:28.439
English?

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.777
Sir. What are you doing, sir'?

01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:35.286
Guideline 17-5: Never question
a senior agent in the field.

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:36.616
No!

01:30:17.379 --> 01:30:20.360
Ambrose' you five-star turd.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.379
Another balls-up, Johnny.

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.218
Ooh.

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:00.725
What's the matter with you?

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:26.417
It's all over, Ambrose.

01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:32.623
You can betray your country,
you can cheat your friends,

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:36.258
but you can't get away
from Johnny English...

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.620
So long, Johnny!

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.359
The D-7.

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:05.457
The bulletproof shield!

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:09.525
Hey! It's not working!

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:11.995
It's the T-2, sir!

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:14.835
- Is he... Oh, he's alive!
- It's the T-2!

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:17.503
Close it. Close ii!

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.305
Stupid thing!

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.026
Oh, Johnny.

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:41.065
The T-2.

01:32:44.993 --> 01:32:48.406
Tucker, you clever boy.

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:10.090
I couldn't be more delighted.

01:33:10.185 --> 01:33:12.256
Vortex's paymasters have been arrested,

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:16.199
and China has expressed its gratitude
to both Britain and the Service.

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.228
We owe English a great deal.

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:26.910
Well, reinstating his knighthood
is a truly lovely gesture.

01:33:27.035 --> 01:33:28.412
And it will mean the world to him.

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:32.909
Her Majesty will be with him shortly.

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.759
Gotcha! Gotcha.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:34.344
Got you!

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:40.647
Just about had enough of you,
you old cow!

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:43.655
You're going nowhere! Pegasus!

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:44.815
English!

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:49.191
It's her! It's the killer cleaner!
Finally, I've got her!

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:54.791
You never know when it's over, do you?

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:59.737
Well, it's over, over, over, over, over!

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:36.017
I don't know how to thank you.

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:37.613
I'd love a take-away.

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:41.357
Consider it done.
