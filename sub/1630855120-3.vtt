00:06.233 --> 00:08.002
<i>Previously on</i>
Fatal Attraction...

00:08.002 --> 00:09.036
I want you to help me find

00:09.036 --> 00:10.905
a copy of my old case file.

00:10.905 --> 00:11.972
The first thing we do is rerun

00:11.972 --> 00:13.040
all the prints that were found

00:13.040 --> 00:14.175
on the scene that weren't yours.

00:14.175 --> 00:15.442
Maybe some people

00:15.442 --> 00:16.811
who weren't printed or arrested

00:16.811 --> 00:18.479
15 years ago
have been arrested by now.

00:18.479 --> 00:19.713
I just wanted to update you

00:19.713 --> 00:20.781
on Tracy Sims.

00:20.781 --> 00:22.216
She's unconscious again,

00:22.216 --> 00:23.751
but I was able to talk to her.

00:23.751 --> 00:25.486
And she ID'd him. She said

00:25.486 --> 00:27.087
he was the one who beat her.

00:27.087 --> 00:28.823
If you could have the ideal

00:28.823 --> 00:30.958
relationship
with him going forward,

00:30.958 --> 00:32.593
<i>have you thought
about what that would be?</i>

00:32.593 --> 00:33.994
<i>I just want to hold his hand.</i>

00:33.994 --> 00:35.229
Did you take something, Alex?

00:35.229 --> 00:36.197
Pills.

00:36.197 --> 00:38.065
<i>I took all of them.</i>

00:53.147 --> 00:54.682
Morning.

00:54.682 --> 00:56.083
Good morning.

00:56.083 --> 00:57.685
See the hearing's been pushed?

00:57.685 --> 00:59.186
I did, yes, thank you and... oh.

00:59.186 --> 01:00.888
Excuse me.

01:00.888 --> 01:02.857
- How are you today?
- Okay.

01:02.857 --> 01:04.792
I had a dream last night
this giant snake

01:04.792 --> 01:06.694
bit me on the face.

01:06.694 --> 01:08.596
That's disturbing.

01:08.596 --> 01:10.831
Beatrice, here for Kosna?

01:10.831 --> 01:12.800
Yep, it's been a while

01:12.800 --> 01:15.669
since I've been up
against one of Norman's juries.

01:15.669 --> 01:17.805
Can't say that I missed it.

02:51.365 --> 02:53.300
<i>I know that you're scared.</i>

02:54.735 --> 02:56.704
And also this robbery
wasn't the first time

02:56.704 --> 02:59.606
that you've experienced
physical violence in your life.

03:00.741 --> 03:03.677
Yeah, but it's not the same.

03:03.677 --> 03:04.979
No, it's not.

03:04.979 --> 03:07.281
But it can still
make you feel like...

03:08.782 --> 03:10.684
...like you're someone that...

03:10.684 --> 03:13.053
violence is drawn to.

03:13.053 --> 03:14.888
The fact that it keeps
happening to you

03:14.888 --> 03:18.292
means that it's going to keep
happening to you.

03:18.292 --> 03:20.194
But those men,

03:20.194 --> 03:21.996
they were strangers to you.

03:21.996 --> 03:23.797
And the way
that your case is going,

03:23.797 --> 03:26.166
there's no reason to believe
that they won't plead out.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.735
And with a plea

03:27.735 --> 03:29.937
comes no victim disclosure
of any kind.

03:29.937 --> 03:31.271
Not even your name.

03:31.271 --> 03:33.107
What if there isn't one?

03:33.107 --> 03:35.676
- A plea.
- Then we'll handle that.

03:37.311 --> 03:39.380
But there will be.

03:40.447 --> 03:42.149
So, for now...

03:42.149 --> 03:45.352
why don't we get
some of these other things

03:45.352 --> 03:46.820
off your plate.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.856
The broken hot water heater.

03:48.856 --> 03:50.758
What is your landlord's number?

03:50.758 --> 03:53.127
I'm in the mood to get loud.

04:02.903 --> 04:03.937
Morning.

04:03.937 --> 04:05.272
How's it going?

04:05.272 --> 04:08.042
Did you see it? It was so tense.

04:08.042 --> 04:09.710
I love a buzzer beater.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.712
I mean, a win's a win.

04:11.712 --> 04:12.913
Defense was for shit though.

04:12.913 --> 04:15.282
I knew you were gonna say that.

04:15.282 --> 04:17.251
What happened?

04:17.251 --> 04:19.686
Oh, this defendant yesterday,
he wanted to get out

04:19.686 --> 04:21.255
of custody,
I reminded him that he can't,

04:21.255 --> 04:23.123
I torqued it a bit.
It'll be fine by tomorrow.

04:23.123 --> 04:24.892
In the meantime...

04:26.093 --> 04:27.961
...why don't you put
a fritter on it?

04:31.365 --> 04:33.867
You can't keep doing this.

04:36.136 --> 04:37.337
<i>I was just worried.</i>

04:37.337 --> 04:40.007
- I got back and you were gone.
- Mm.

04:40.007 --> 04:43.043
So what happened
when you went back?

04:43.043 --> 04:44.745
He was sweet.

04:44.745 --> 04:46.980
He said he's only
ever afraid of losing me,

04:46.980 --> 04:48.982
is the reason always
for what he does.

04:48.982 --> 04:51.151
I say, he makes me
sell his drugs for him

04:51.151 --> 04:52.853
so he won't lose me?

04:52.853 --> 04:54.421
He didn't already kill me once
because the hospital

04:54.421 --> 04:56.757
was too good and fast
at their job for me to die,

04:56.757 --> 04:58.725
but he's afraid to lose me?

04:58.725 --> 05:01.261
- You said all that?
- Yes.

05:01.261 --> 05:03.230
To myself.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.165
I'm not mad at you.

05:05.165 --> 05:06.767
Why?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.936
After all what you did for me,
I would feel mad.

05:08.936 --> 05:10.337
Maybe you should.

05:10.337 --> 05:11.905
Would that help?

05:11.905 --> 05:14.174
Because I'll totally do it.
I like being mad.

05:15.142 --> 05:17.845
He blames you. Artem.

05:17.845 --> 05:20.080
He says we never had trouble
before you.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.815
Well, I did invent trouble.

05:31.191 --> 05:33.026
<i>I'm with Victims Services.</i>

05:33.026 --> 05:35.262
Instead of Conchita Lewis.

05:35.262 --> 05:36.864
- For the Siddiqui case.
- Calendar number?

05:36.864 --> 05:38.165
Um...

05:38.165 --> 05:39.867
Six. It's six.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.836
All right, I've got it.

05:46.273 --> 05:47.307
What's your name?

05:47.307 --> 05:49.877
It's Alex Forrest.

05:49.877 --> 05:52.846
- That fritter looks good.
- It is good.

05:52.846 --> 05:54.314
Plus, it was free, so...

05:55.582 --> 05:57.117
<i>Nawaz?</i>

05:57.117 --> 05:58.819
Hi, Mona. I'm Alex.

05:58.819 --> 06:00.821
I met you with Conchita.
Do you remember me?

06:00.821 --> 06:02.556
- Yeah.
- Yes.

06:08.962 --> 06:10.464
Here's how today's going
to go...

06:10.464 --> 06:12.065
<i>Big day.</i>

06:12.065 --> 06:13.934
All the times
I had to remind you

06:13.934 --> 06:15.536
don't do anything
to make the jury

06:15.536 --> 06:18.305
feel bad or feel sorry

06:18.305 --> 06:19.973
for the man
that murdered Yalina.

06:19.973 --> 06:22.409
But today...

06:22.409 --> 06:24.478
this is--

06:35.022 --> 06:37.090
This is the sentencing phase.
Today is the day

06:37.090 --> 06:39.826
for all the emotions,
and this is the place.

06:40.561 --> 06:41.895
Okay?

07:20.567 --> 07:23.270
They are, actually,
really, really well.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.172
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>

07:25.172 --> 07:27.207
I thought that you would be.

07:27.207 --> 07:29.576
You know, considering...

07:29.576 --> 07:31.645
how often you had to listen

07:31.645 --> 07:33.647
to how well things
were <i>not</i> going.

07:33.647 --> 07:36.350
<i>Well, how are you doing
with finding someone there?</i>

07:36.350 --> 07:38.552
It's just, uh...

07:38.552 --> 07:40.921
you know,
with their schedules and...

07:40.921 --> 07:42.522
my schedule, it's...

07:42.522 --> 07:44.324
even if you work that part out,

07:44.324 --> 07:46.360
then, you know, you have to,
you have to meet,

07:46.360 --> 07:48.495
and then you have to click.

07:48.495 --> 07:50.597
<i>- That's just the process.</i>
- I know, but how do you know...

07:50.597 --> 07:52.633
in one session?

07:52.633 --> 07:53.967
Right? Look how long it took us.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.402
<i>Alex--</i>

07:55.402 --> 07:58.472
I-I know, but this is
what I'm thinking, okay?

07:58.472 --> 08:01.241
I don't even really need...

08:01.241 --> 08:03.910
like, a regular scheduled thing.

08:03.910 --> 08:06.146
At all, I just...

08:06.146 --> 08:08.282
need advice sometimes.

08:08.282 --> 08:10.550
You know, from somebody
who knows me...

08:10.550 --> 08:12.619
<i>I'm not certified in Californi.</i>

08:12.619 --> 08:14.187
I understand that,
but even over--

08:14.187 --> 08:16.290
I'm talking
about over the phone, so...

08:16.290 --> 08:18.492
it seems pretty stupid to me
that you can't even talk...

08:18.492 --> 08:19.960
<i>You have to keep looking.</i>

08:19.960 --> 08:22.095
I mean, I am. I...

08:27.334 --> 08:28.502
You sound mad.

08:28.502 --> 08:29.703
<i>I'm not.</i>

08:29.703 --> 08:32.005
Okay.

08:33.407 --> 08:35.542
You know, you can say that,
but I can actually tell

08:35.542 --> 08:37.511
if you're mad at me or not,

08:37.511 --> 08:39.413
so I don't know
why you wouldn't just...

08:39.413 --> 08:41.248
<i>Take care of yourself. Bye now.</i>

09:13.447 --> 09:16.216
The hidden source
is the watchful heart.

09:16.216 --> 09:18.552
The hidden source is
the watchful heart.

09:20.487 --> 09:22.289
The hidden source
is the watchful heart.

09:22.289 --> 09:24.491
The hidden source
is the watchful...

09:25.826 --> 09:27.427
The hidden source is
the watchful heart.

09:27.427 --> 09:28.762
The hidden source is...

09:28.762 --> 09:31.264
The hidden source
is the watchful heart.

09:44.444 --> 09:46.513
- Hey.
- What are you doing downstairs?

09:46.513 --> 09:48.448
Mendoza's out sick.

09:48.448 --> 09:50.550
I had to cover. What 60-year-old
gets fucking mono?

09:50.550 --> 09:52.319
- Goddamn it.
- You're having a day.

09:52.319 --> 09:54.654
Jesus Christ, I-I...

09:54.654 --> 09:56.390
Got a flat yesterday.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.758
It's unfixable.

10:06.566 --> 10:09.169
...guys telling me
when I can show up,

10:09.169 --> 10:12.038
when I can have lunch,
when I can take a shit.

10:12.038 --> 10:13.807
I'm a D.A., I shit when I want.

10:13.807 --> 10:15.675
So is Judge Glynn gonna
retire, too, now that you are?

10:15.675 --> 10:17.110
You're the only one
who makes sure

10:17.110 --> 10:19.045
he doesn't drink before lunch.

10:19.045 --> 10:20.614
Sometimes I tell him
I put Sambuca in his coffee.

10:20.614 --> 10:22.115
- Do you?
- He didn't.

10:22.115 --> 10:24.151
But I didn't.

10:24.151 --> 10:25.552
But he thinks I did. Cheers.

10:25.552 --> 10:27.421
Does he--?

10:27.421 --> 10:29.122
You know it's not
happening, right?

10:29.122 --> 10:30.390
What's not happening?

10:30.390 --> 10:32.559
He didn't get it,
the appointment.

10:32.559 --> 10:34.461
Oh, my God,
you're kidding!

10:35.896 --> 10:38.832
Dan, uh, Gallagher,
he was up for judge.

10:38.832 --> 10:40.734
Wow, that's crazy.
What happened?

10:40.734 --> 10:42.736
Maybe somebody
called in a bigger favor?

10:42.736 --> 10:45.505
Or there's people
that still hate his dad.

10:45.505 --> 10:47.707
Maybe they got together,
and did a little conspiring.

10:47.707 --> 10:49.543
People being dicks
isn't a conspiracy.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.144
All right.

10:51.144 --> 10:52.446
I'm gonna head back. You coming?

10:52.446 --> 10:54.714
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna

10:54.714 --> 10:56.349
grab a cookie first.
You want a cookie?

10:56.349 --> 10:57.818
Of course,
that's why I'm leaving.

11:03.490 --> 11:06.827
<i>I'm here...
minimum three times a week.</i>

11:06.827 --> 11:08.395
<i>Which means that
since you moved,</i>

11:08.395 --> 11:10.597
<i>I have been here 90 times.</i>

11:10.597 --> 11:13.834
<i>Must be the place
to be, I guess.</i>

11:13.834 --> 11:15.569
<i>Or just the place</i>

11:15.569 --> 11:17.838
<i>I always am.</i>

11:17.838 --> 11:20.140
Are you okay?

11:20.140 --> 11:22.375
You seem...

11:22.375 --> 11:24.211
I don't know,

11:24.211 --> 11:26.513
something right now.

11:27.681 --> 11:29.850
Yeah, I probably do.

11:29.850 --> 11:32.152
It'll be okay.

11:32.152 --> 11:34.387
Or it won't.

12:47.761 --> 12:48.488
Good night.

12:50.931 --> 12:55.408
Good night, ladies.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.742
See you next week, Doc.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.612
Hey.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.815
Uh-oh, he bailed on you.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.450
Right?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.652
Too hungry to wait, I guess.

13:06.652 --> 13:08.454
What were those, um...

13:08.454 --> 13:09.922
the sandwiches,

13:09.922 --> 13:11.490
with the peppers,
the Italian ones?

13:11.490 --> 13:13.726
Ah, the Calabrian.
The-the hot pepper salad.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.528
Yeah, I think about those
all the time.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.865
Oh, um...

13:21.334 --> 13:22.969
Oh, shit, yeah,
I couldn't remember,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.637
uh, where I--

13:24.637 --> 13:25.972
I just bought another one.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.707
- So... Keep it.
- Oh.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.709
That's how long it's been
since we've hung out.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.510
You forgot where it was.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.513
I just... things have
just been crazy.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.482
I mean, I-I had to stop
seeing new patients.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.684
Start a waiting list.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.319
Uh...

13:40.319 --> 13:41.621
Yeah, so I-I just don't
want you to think that...

13:41.621 --> 13:43.356
it's just my schedule,

13:43.356 --> 13:44.790
I just have no time
for anything these days.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.859
I don't,
I really don't think that.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.861
Okay, good, because...

13:48.861 --> 13:51.263
I-I don't think the way that
you've been acting for the past

13:51.263 --> 13:54.333
however long has been
a function of scheduling,

13:54.333 --> 13:57.470
Paul, and remember
before you argue,

13:57.470 --> 14:00.573
just how long it's been since
you've returned a phone call

14:00.573 --> 14:02.608
or even answered the door.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.710
Or at least...

14:04.710 --> 14:06.912
remember that I remember.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.816
I'm... I've just
been crazy busy.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.618
- Really.
- So you-- I mean, you still,

14:12.618 --> 14:14.053
like, want to be friends, right?

14:14.053 --> 14:16.389
- Yeah. Of course I do.
- Okay, good.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.990
Great.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.860
'Cause I've been
crazy busy, too, but I...

14:20.860 --> 14:23.729
I always have time
for my friends.

14:23.729 --> 14:25.564
What I don't
have time for, though,

14:25.564 --> 14:27.299
is criminals.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.535
That's what I don't
have time for.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.671
In fact, I have
a professional obligation

14:31.671 --> 14:33.439
to report criminals.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.409
I mean, obviously,
I work in the criminal courts.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.912
But friends,
I always have time for those.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.876
Thanks.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.893
I can hear you now.
Yeah, go ahead.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.561
<i>You want the works on both?</i>

16:02.561 --> 16:05.064
Yes, uh, the hot pepper,

16:05.064 --> 16:07.666
the pepper salad,
is that in the works?

16:07.666 --> 16:10.035
- The Calabrian...?
<i>- Yep.</i>

16:10.035 --> 16:12.505
- Then yes.
<i>- Okay, two with the works.</i>

16:12.505 --> 16:14.140
<i>It'll be 20 or 30 minutes.</i>

16:14.140 --> 16:16.475
- Thank you.
<i>- All right.</i>

16:34.093 --> 16:36.796
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.764
Hold on.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.670
Oh, God.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.973
<i>Um...</i>

16:47.973 --> 16:50.643
<i>because I found them,
and I thought you would like</i>

16:50.643 --> 16:51.977
<i>- to have them.</i>
- Is it an apology?

16:51.977 --> 16:53.179
<i>No. For what?</i>

16:54.780 --> 16:56.649
I don't know,
for the things that you said?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.017
For the way that you said them?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.852
<i>Okay, wait.</i>

16:59.852 --> 17:02.822
<i>Which time that you
overreacted was this?</i>

17:02.822 --> 17:04.790
Okay, then how about
you apologize

17:04.790 --> 17:06.692
for how you fucking
ruin everything?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.727
<i>What are we ruining again?</i>

17:08.727 --> 17:10.696
<i>What, what is there to ruin?</i>

17:10.696 --> 17:12.932
<i>Seriously, tell me, Alex,
because I-I don't know.</i>

17:12.932 --> 17:15.167
Yeah, why would you?

17:15.167 --> 17:16.836
Fu-- I have to go.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.840
Hey-oh, I got a fuckton
of sandwich here.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.642
- For someone named Alex?
- Yeah, just put them
on the table.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.111
Okay.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.214
You expecting guests?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.748
Or you think you're gonna handle

17:29.748 --> 17:31.584
both of these bad boys
by yourself?

17:31.584 --> 17:33.519
'Cause if you're trying
to save one for tomorrow...

17:33.519 --> 17:36.555
bad idea, too many condiments.
It soaks the bread.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.091
But if you want to do it, just
know we don't endorse that shit.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.759
So, it's up to you.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.528
Yeah.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.764
Your whole thing has
too many condiments.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.269
Yeah, okay.

18:13.951 --> 18:15.152
Do you know how?
I man, can you roller-skate?

18:15.152 --> 18:16.553
I mean,
I don't remember doing it,

18:16.553 --> 18:18.021
but I remember that I did it.

18:20.691 --> 18:23.126
I used to be able
to roller-skate.

18:23.126 --> 18:25.729
I'd probably break my ass
if I tried now.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.232
I think you should do it, seriously.

18:36.106 --> 18:37.841
So what do you think?

18:37.841 --> 18:39.142
Is this the one?

18:39.142 --> 18:41.578
It's certainly on budget.

18:42.479 --> 18:45.515
Though I may not be able
to find myself a job, so...

18:49.620 --> 18:51.788
Come on, daughter
of a general contractor.

18:51.788 --> 18:54.024
- What do you think?
- Well, um...

18:55.092 --> 18:57.661
It was weird how hard
they made it for you to get in

18:57.661 --> 18:59.930
to see it
and that's kind of a red flag.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.766
And, uh, also Arthur would say
that they just painted

19:02.766 --> 19:05.535
this part of the wall here and
then they left the cans there

19:05.535 --> 19:07.070
because they want you to think
that they're renovating,

19:07.070 --> 19:09.306
but once you're in,
they're never gonna come back

19:09.306 --> 19:11.742
and finish it,
and, uh, also the bathtub

19:11.742 --> 19:13.777
is spraypainted white
to make it seem like

19:13.777 --> 19:16.313
- the enamel's not coming off.
- So Arthur would
keep looking, huh?

19:16.313 --> 19:17.915
Yeah.

19:17.915 --> 19:20.050
Yeah, Arthur would
definitely keep looking.

19:20.050 --> 19:22.219
You get along with him?

19:23.387 --> 19:25.055
I mean, I don't know why
you wouldn't.

19:25.055 --> 19:26.757
You always did.

19:26.757 --> 19:28.692
- Um...
- What do you call him?

19:32.896 --> 19:35.299
Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.000
I shouldn't have said that. I...

19:37.000 --> 19:39.102
That, I'm...

19:43.373 --> 19:45.642
There is something
that I-I just,

19:45.642 --> 19:47.945
I want to say this
to you, that...

19:49.947 --> 19:52.015
I really thought
I was gonna die in there.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.720
And in the beginning,
I didn't even know

19:56.720 --> 19:58.622
how to...

19:58.622 --> 20:01.124
start thinking about that.

20:03.126 --> 20:05.963
And once I did...

20:05.963 --> 20:09.032
I just was thinking
of you and your mom.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.235
And I would just drown in it.

20:15.305 --> 20:17.908
So I really had two choices.

20:17.908 --> 20:20.377
And both of them were bad.

20:20.377 --> 20:22.646
But one of them was
better for you.

20:23.814 --> 20:25.916
I mean, I don't know, I just,
I think if I would've made

20:25.916 --> 20:28.752
- the other choice
I probably wouldn't...
- Okay.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.127
You know,
I think this isn't the one.

20:37.127 --> 20:39.296
- Why don't we head
down to the other place...
- Uh, it's

20:39.296 --> 20:41.331
getting later than I thought,
so I'm actually gonna go.

20:41.331 --> 20:43.867
Um... are you good to get
over there by yourself?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.302
- Of course.
- There's a bus stop that's

20:45.302 --> 20:47.304
on this side.
It's about half a block away.

20:48.305 --> 20:49.840
You can probably find that.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.874
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.642
For today.

20:59.816 --> 21:01.785
I'll grab some meatballs
in a second.

21:08.258 --> 21:09.893
Hey, Dan.

21:22.973 --> 21:26.043
I thought you said you came here
a minimum three times a week.

21:33.283 --> 21:36.053
<i>And what did Mike
have to say about that?</i>

21:36.053 --> 21:37.020
<i>Nothing.</i>

21:37.020 --> 21:38.789
<i>I never told him.</i>

21:40.357 --> 21:44.194
<i>I actually never told anybody.</i>

21:47.464 --> 21:50.233
At least 40% of those wins
the jurors

21:50.233 --> 21:52.235
were probably not listening
to a word you said,

21:52.235 --> 21:54.805
they were too busy
watching your mouth.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.214
I'm going to the ladies' room.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.218
Yep.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.937
<i>Fraud Bureau Steve Park?</i>

23:00.937 --> 23:02.873
Yes, I've been assigned
to a case of his,

23:02.873 --> 23:05.175
but I've never met him, so...

23:05.175 --> 23:07.110
Um, smart guy.

23:08.311 --> 23:09.513
Slightly an enormous asshole.

23:16.286 --> 23:17.521
<i>Verschlimmbesserung.</i>

23:17.521 --> 23:19.289
That's, um...

23:19.289 --> 23:21.024
when you make
a bad situation worse.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.193
Like you're trying to apologize

23:23.193 --> 23:25.061
to somebody for
calling them stupid

23:25.061 --> 23:26.363
and you accidentally
call them old.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.132
That is a weirdly
specific example.

23:33.003 --> 23:35.238
Pardon my arm.

24:24.387 --> 24:26.256
"You are fantastic.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.624
Thank you."

24:27.624 --> 24:30.093
<i>Did he give you his number?</i>

24:30.093 --> 24:31.928
We-we work together, remember?

24:31.928 --> 24:34.064
He knows that I have it.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.868
So you still think that
there's nothing to ruin?

24:38.868 --> 24:41.972
<i>Well, he's definitely
leaving the door open.</i>

24:41.972 --> 24:44.007
<i>Leaving it up to you
to walk through it, though.</i>

24:44.007 --> 24:46.543
But that is what he wants
me to do, though. Right?

24:46.543 --> 24:48.578
<i>Well, he's a lawyer,
you say he's a good one.</i>

24:48.578 --> 24:50.313
<i>I'm not a lawyer
but even I know:</i>

24:50.313 --> 24:54.117
<i>You leave a door open,
someone's gonna come in.</i>

25:13.603 --> 25:15.205
Quincy-- Ah!

25:15.872 --> 25:18.141
Oh, my-- Oh, no.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.609
Quincy, what are you
doing, buddy?

25:19.609 --> 25:21.211
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

25:21.211 --> 25:22.679
- Yes, I...
- Hey. Hey.

25:22.679 --> 25:25.482
- ...twisted my dignity.
- Hey. Buddy.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.983
Come here, buddy. Come here.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.518
Oh, I lost an earring.

25:28.518 --> 25:31.021
You can't do that, okay?

25:31.021 --> 25:33.256
You can't do that.
You're too big now.

25:33.256 --> 25:34.591
You're not a puppy anymore.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.330
You're so tired,
it's been a big day.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.564
Been a big day.

25:43.033 --> 25:45.402
So tired. Been a big day.

25:45.402 --> 25:47.537
You killer attack dog.

25:47.537 --> 25:49.939
Hi, buddy.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.475
Everybody tired? Don't worry,
just hang in there.

25:52.475 --> 25:54.511
I have some hamburger
I can make him.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.512
No.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.447
No.

25:57.447 --> 26:00.050
He does not do well
with dietary changes

26:00.050 --> 26:01.451
and I cannot afford
a car blowout

26:01.451 --> 26:03.553
after what he did
at home last night.

26:03.553 --> 26:05.655
I just got to take him home
and feed him there.

26:05.655 --> 26:07.590
Also, I just realized...

26:07.590 --> 26:11.094
the cleaning service might've
left my place unlocked.

26:21.338 --> 26:23.306
Thank you for today.

26:25.775 --> 26:27.577
It was great.

26:28.678 --> 26:30.613
Yeah.

26:30.613 --> 26:32.615
It kind of really was.

26:46.262 --> 26:48.465
Which is just my luck.

27:23.133 --> 27:24.534
<i>So what are you asking me?</i>

27:24.534 --> 27:26.770
It's just, uh,
their mom is gone,

27:26.770 --> 27:28.271
my wife is gone.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.573
It's just the two
of them and me left.

27:30.573 --> 27:34.110
And they're saying either
I drop it...

27:34.110 --> 27:35.745
or they're gonna leave me.

27:35.745 --> 27:38.248
If the case against your
grandsons doesn't proceed,

27:38.248 --> 27:39.716
then you have to take on

27:39.716 --> 27:41.284
all of the debt that they
incurred in your name.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.386
That means you either
have to pay that off

27:43.386 --> 27:45.155
or you have
to declare bankruptcy.

27:45.155 --> 27:48.191
What if the case goes forward
in some different way?

27:48.191 --> 27:49.592
Like if y'all...

27:49.592 --> 27:53.263
Like if the state pressed
charges against them?

27:53.263 --> 27:55.498
Not me, but on
my behalf, you know?

27:55.498 --> 27:59.135
That way, the kids
get consequences.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.303
And I'm not the one who--

28:00.303 --> 28:02.238
Avery, you have
been here before.

28:02.238 --> 28:04.107
You know how this goes.

28:04.107 --> 28:07.343
You're just making it harder
by pretending that you don't.

28:08.511 --> 28:10.313
Now, you get to decide...

28:10.313 --> 28:14.717
if you want to be with the
people that hurt you, or alone.

28:14.717 --> 28:18.455
But it has to be one
or the other, because...

28:18.455 --> 28:21.191
those are the choices
that you have.

28:46.416 --> 28:48.451
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

28:48.451 --> 28:50.820
Uh, hope you're not looking
for Dr. Paul.

28:50.820 --> 28:53.490
Keys in my mailbox,
no notice or anything.

28:53.490 --> 28:55.825
Floors were refinished
when he moved in.

28:55.825 --> 28:59.529
Now it looks like one of those
Zen garden things you rake

28:59.529 --> 29:02.298
except he forgot
the fucking sand.

29:02.298 --> 29:04.801
Now I got to deal with it
or the management company

29:04.801 --> 29:06.870
is gonna make me eat shit.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.805
So, sorry in advance.

29:08.805 --> 29:11.407
Next however many days
around here

29:11.407 --> 29:14.644
it's probably gonna get
a little hard to breathe.

29:25.221 --> 29:28.458
And please give
the defendant written notice

29:28.458 --> 29:30.493
of her right to appeal.

29:32.295 --> 29:33.830
Court dismissed.

29:33.830 --> 29:35.732
All right.

30:07.797 --> 30:09.766
<i>Who was it who pinch-hit</i>

30:09.766 --> 30:10.800
for you on the Siddiquis?

30:10.800 --> 30:11.968
Alice?
Oh.

30:11.968 --> 30:13.836
- Alex. Mm-hmm.
- Alex. Right.

30:13.836 --> 30:15.438
Yeah, I mean,
that could work.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.773
Do you want to brief her?
Do you want me to--

30:16.773 --> 30:17.974
No, no.
You can take care of that.

30:17.974 --> 30:19.309
She seemed smart.

30:24.847 --> 30:26.716
<i>She's in a coma
at Saint Matthew's,</i>

30:26.716 --> 30:28.585
and no one is optimistic.

30:28.585 --> 30:31.754
So, the thing is, if she does
not identify Jonathan Coleman

30:31.754 --> 30:33.856
as the one who assaulted her,
we have no case.

30:33.856 --> 30:35.458
So, Dan is getting creative

30:35.458 --> 30:37.760
and he said you did great
with the Siddiquis,

30:37.760 --> 30:38.995
that you're smart.

30:38.995 --> 30:40.830
- I like to think so.
- So do I.

30:40.830 --> 30:42.565
Since I'm the one who hired you.

30:42.565 --> 30:44.567
But I've been wrong before.

30:44.567 --> 30:46.469
Right.

30:49.706 --> 30:51.474
<i>And we watched it together.</i>

30:51.474 --> 30:53.576
<i>My mother didn't want to
because it was upsetting,</i>

30:53.576 --> 30:55.278
it was about war.

30:56.045 --> 30:58.281
But he loved it so much, so...

30:58.281 --> 31:01.384
I wanted to love it, too.

31:01.384 --> 31:05.421
<i>I couldn't follow the names
or the battles, but...</i>

31:05.421 --> 31:07.023
<i>then this actor,
he read the last letter</i>

31:07.023 --> 31:10.560
<i>that this Union Army major
wrote to his wife Sarah</i>

31:10.560 --> 31:11.894
<i>before he died at, uh...</i>

31:11.894 --> 31:14.030
<i>My dad would kill me.</i>

31:14.030 --> 31:17.600
<i>Um, Bull Run, I think.</i>

31:19.569 --> 31:21.804
<i>And then I understood everything.</i>

31:22.772 --> 31:25.808
<i>Sullivan Ballou was his name.</i>

31:25.808 --> 31:28.811
<i>He crystallized his whole world</i>

31:28.811 --> 31:31.814
<i>into just pure emotion,
in that letter.</i>

31:31.814 --> 31:34.651
<i>Everything else breaking down,</i>

31:34.651 --> 31:36.619
<i>fading away to just...</i>

31:36.619 --> 31:39.756
<i>love, in the face of death.</i>

31:40.590 --> 31:43.826
My dad remembers
all the battlefields,

31:43.826 --> 31:45.962
the dates, but...

31:45.962 --> 31:47.664
I remember this.

31:47.664 --> 31:49.932
"Forgive my many faults,

31:49.932 --> 31:52.635
"and the many pains
I have caused you.

31:52.635 --> 31:57.507
"How thoughtless and foolish
I have sometimes been.

31:57.507 --> 32:00.677
"How gladly would I struggle
with all the misfortune

32:00.677 --> 32:04.514
"of this world,
to shield you from harm.

32:04.514 --> 32:05.882
"But O, Sarah...

32:05.882 --> 32:08.918
"if the dead can come back
to this earth,

32:08.918 --> 32:11.054
"I shall always be near you.

32:12.789 --> 32:15.391
<i>"Amidst your happiest scenes</i>

32:15.391 --> 32:18.795
<i>and gloomiest hours, always."</i>

32:29.972 --> 32:31.974
<i>I didn't think that this
is what we were doing.</i>

32:31.974 --> 32:35.344
What were we doing?

32:37.914 --> 32:39.949
Really, what were we doing?

32:41.184 --> 32:45.421
Alex, I'm sorry,
but I really do have to go.

32:45.421 --> 32:48.057
Well, then you really should go.

33:58.127 --> 33:59.662
Do you want me to stay?

34:04.767 --> 34:06.002
But you can go.

35:15.338 --> 35:16.772
It's not what it looks like.

35:16.772 --> 35:18.941
Looks like yesterday's
clothes, big guy.

35:18.941 --> 35:20.610
Looks like the wages of sin.

35:20.610 --> 35:22.678
If falling asleep on your couch
was a sin,

35:22.678 --> 35:24.580
then everyone in this bureau
would burn.

35:25.648 --> 35:27.149
Yeah, no, that was good.

35:27.149 --> 35:28.518
That was good,
a little self-righteous,

35:28.518 --> 35:29.919
no pause to think.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.888
Overall convincing.
I'll give you a nine.

35:31.888 --> 35:33.089
Can I take these socks?

35:33.089 --> 35:34.724
"To each according
to his needs."

35:34.724 --> 35:37.026
Oh, really?

35:37.026 --> 35:39.795
The walk of shame closet
is a Marxist utopia?

35:39.795 --> 35:42.031
What, so you're admitting you're
doing the walk of shame?

35:42.031 --> 35:44.166
You honestly think I could pull
it off, living like you?

35:44.166 --> 35:46.702
I fell asleep on my couch.

35:46.702 --> 35:48.137
Are these cashmere?

35:48.137 --> 35:49.272
They're amazing.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.774
You know what? I believe you.

36:05.054 --> 36:07.924
Hmm. Alex Forrest
from Victim Services

36:07.924 --> 36:09.125
was looking to have
a quick word with you

36:09.125 --> 36:10.326
about the Sims case.

36:10.326 --> 36:12.295
I put her in
the conference room.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.132
I just wanted to...

36:50.132 --> 36:52.201
apologize, um,
for what happened.

36:52.201 --> 36:54.337
I'm so sorry.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.106
- You don't have to do that.
- I do.

36:58.407 --> 37:01.010
No, there's...

37:01.010 --> 37:03.646
absolutely nothing
for you to be sorry about.

37:03.646 --> 37:06.615
I appreciate that, but...

37:06.615 --> 37:10.186
your kindness,
I'm so grateful, your...

37:10.186 --> 37:11.821
- discretion.
- Alex.

37:11.821 --> 37:13.723
I'm just happy that you're okay.

37:13.723 --> 37:15.057
I am.

37:16.859 --> 37:18.928
I am, I don't...

37:18.928 --> 37:21.697
know what that was.

37:23.132 --> 37:25.801
Compassion fatigue?

37:27.269 --> 37:31.640
A failure to empathize
with yourself, maybe?

37:32.875 --> 37:34.710
Hmm. Maybe.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.980
Maybe exactly. That's...

37:37.980 --> 37:41.917
exactly the kind of thing
you always just seem to know.

37:41.917 --> 37:44.387
That I have to at least,
at least ask.

37:44.387 --> 37:46.922
If there's something
that we can...

37:46.922 --> 37:50.192
um, you know, some sort of...

37:50.192 --> 37:54.663
I don't know,
casually adjacent hanging out,

37:54.663 --> 37:58.801
maybe the occasional
very bland margarita, or...

38:02.004 --> 38:04.173
I know what you're saying.

38:07.443 --> 38:11.347
I just don't see
how that could work.

38:11.347 --> 38:12.982
In fact, it definitely wouldn't.

38:12.982 --> 38:14.050
Of course not.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.185
That, I mean, what are we even--

38:16.185 --> 38:18.821
What are we even talking about?

38:18.821 --> 38:20.956
Anyway, um...

38:22.058 --> 38:23.192
Thank you.

38:23.192 --> 38:25.761
For everything.

39:03.099 --> 39:05.034
Hey.

39:05.034 --> 39:06.902
I'm so sorry, I...

39:06.902 --> 39:08.504
As soon as you have to be at
a place at a certain time...

39:08.504 --> 39:10.439
- Hey, don't worry about it.
- ...that's when your client

39:10.439 --> 39:12.208
brings up a complaint they've
been hanging onto for months.

39:12.208 --> 39:14.510
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't, don't... worry about it.

39:14.510 --> 39:16.979
I don't have as much time
as I thought.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.347
Sorry about that, too.

39:25.488 --> 39:26.989
I like the...

39:30.092 --> 39:31.494
You're wearing it well.

39:32.862 --> 39:34.430
Thank you.

39:34.430 --> 39:36.398
So are you.

39:36.398 --> 39:38.534
What did you actually
want to talk about?

39:40.970 --> 39:43.272
Uh...

39:43.272 --> 39:47.843
You know, did Ellen...

39:47.843 --> 39:50.279
- tell you about my, um...
- Yeah.

39:50.279 --> 39:53.215
She did.

39:53.215 --> 39:56.152
And Mike, Mike's always
kept me up to speed

39:56.152 --> 39:58.254
on whatever he knew about you.

40:00.856 --> 40:03.859
That's... not a surprise.

40:08.164 --> 40:09.365
It does make some
of the other things

40:09.365 --> 40:11.567
a little harder for me to...

40:11.567 --> 40:13.235
wrap my head around, though.

40:13.235 --> 40:14.470
Like what?

40:14.470 --> 40:15.938
Like...

40:15.938 --> 40:18.340
Even though...

40:20.543 --> 40:22.444
I still feel like I made
the right decision,

40:22.444 --> 40:24.947
it blows my mind how
completely you just...

40:24.947 --> 40:26.515
Believed you?

40:28.918 --> 40:31.554
Took you seriously?
Did what you asked?

40:34.256 --> 40:36.025
This is what we're doing here?

40:39.161 --> 40:42.164
No matter how wrong
and insane it felt to me,

40:42.164 --> 40:44.300
you said it was what you needed.

40:44.300 --> 40:45.534
That if you had
to think about us,

40:45.534 --> 40:47.136
thinking about you
in that place,

40:47.136 --> 40:49.471
you wouldn't survive.
You said "survive."

40:49.471 --> 40:50.973
So wrong and so insane that you

40:50.973 --> 40:52.608
just completely went
along with it?

40:52.608 --> 40:54.210
You wouldn't authorize
my visits,

40:54.210 --> 40:55.978
you sent all my letters back.

40:55.978 --> 41:00.916
I can't fight with someone
who-who won't engage.

41:00.916 --> 41:03.852
Also, I had to show Ellen

41:03.852 --> 41:06.388
how to live with a thing
you can't change.

41:07.656 --> 41:09.391
So what did you say to her?

41:12.094 --> 41:13.529
That you wouldn't...

41:13.529 --> 41:16.632
be in our lives, but you'd
never stop loving her.

41:25.474 --> 41:27.543
And how did she take that?

41:29.311 --> 41:31.046
She was really bad, it was bad.

41:33.549 --> 41:35.384
She talked about you
for a long time,

41:35.384 --> 41:37.052
then she stopped.

41:37.052 --> 41:39.521
Maybe she thought that's
what you wanted her to do.

41:46.061 --> 41:47.663
Now I'm gonna be late.

41:56.572 --> 41:58.641
<i>Hi, it's me. Again.</i>

42:00.442 --> 42:02.544
I'm gonna have this new special,

42:02.544 --> 42:07.016
this robiola cheese
with roasted tomatoes.

42:08.150 --> 42:09.351
You know for me
to order not meatballs,

42:09.351 --> 42:11.086
it must be pretty good.

42:12.254 --> 42:14.123
But I don't know how much
longer it'll be on the menu.

42:14.123 --> 42:15.557
So this is your heads-up.

42:15.557 --> 42:17.126
Because I haven't seen you
here in a while.

42:17.126 --> 42:18.427
It's starting to make me
feel like

42:18.427 --> 42:20.195
maybe I misunderstood something,

42:20.195 --> 42:22.498
except I really don't think
that I did.

42:24.099 --> 42:26.101
I think you might have, though.

42:27.336 --> 42:29.038
And so I want to help.

42:29.038 --> 42:31.373
I want to help you be the man

42:31.373 --> 42:33.175
that I know that you are.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.411
For your sake
and for everybody else's.

42:35.411 --> 42:37.379
But in order to do that,

42:37.379 --> 42:40.382
I can't let you pretend
like I don't exist.

42:40.382 --> 42:43.652
Because I <i>do</i> exist.

42:44.787 --> 42:47.489
And I'm not going to
be ignored, Dan.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.694
How was it?

42:53.595 --> 42:56.265
I wanted to lick the plate.

42:59.468 --> 43:00.536
<i>The open house</i>

43:00.536 --> 43:02.004
is officially over at 5:00

43:02.004 --> 43:03.272
so somebody's gonna come
back around 6:00,

43:03.272 --> 43:04.740
6:15-ish to pick her up.

43:04.740 --> 43:06.642
And it'll probably be me.

43:06.642 --> 43:09.244
Okay, well, we'll just be here
reading I assume.

43:09.244 --> 43:11.480
- How many books
did you bring today?
- Five.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.349
For not even a whole day?

43:13.349 --> 43:16.118
She also has a language arts
worksheet she needs to finish.

43:16.118 --> 43:18.987
Well, this is Nana's house,
we don't do homework

43:18.987 --> 43:20.489
- at Nana's house.
- You heard the woman.

43:22.191 --> 43:23.659
You're supposed to be
the grown-up here.

43:23.659 --> 43:25.494
Yeah, well, I'm supposed
to be a lot of things.

43:25.494 --> 43:26.662
Bye.

43:26.662 --> 43:28.530
Bye.

43:35.504 --> 43:37.072
<i>Hey, I've got a Dr. Diamond</i>

43:37.072 --> 43:38.173
<i>calling from Saint Matthew's.</i>

43:38.173 --> 43:39.274
Okay, yep.

43:39.274 --> 43:41.443
<i>Hold on.</i>

43:41.443 --> 43:43.245
<i>Yeah?</i>
- Hi, this is Dan Gallagher.

43:43.245 --> 43:46.014
<i>Hey, uh, your name was in
the file on Tracy Sims.</i>

43:46.014 --> 43:48.584
<i>- Contact DDA
directly in case of--</i>
- Yep, yep.

43:48.584 --> 43:52.454
<i>So, I'm calling to inform you
Ms. Sims passed away.</i>

43:52.454 --> 43:55.090
Oh, shit, that's...

43:56.392 --> 43:59.661
That's terrible news, I-I...

43:59.661 --> 44:02.398
I just assumed
she was getting better.

44:02.398 --> 44:04.233
<i>Why?</i>

44:04.233 --> 44:06.135
Well, because of...

44:06.135 --> 44:08.137
you know, that day when my...

44:08.137 --> 44:10.372
colleague was there
and she spoke with her.

44:10.372 --> 44:12.141
<i>Ms. Sims came in braindead</i>

44:12.141 --> 44:14.109
<i>and that status did not change.</i>

44:14.109 --> 44:16.278
<i>Not to speak, not to anything.</i>

44:16.278 --> 44:17.613
<i>I don't know who
told you otherwise,</i>

44:17.613 --> 44:20.082
<i>but they are not correct.</i>

44:22.518 --> 44:23.652
Okay, thank you.

44:23.652 --> 44:25.320
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:35.364 --> 44:37.266
<i>This is Alex Forrest,</i>

44:37.266 --> 44:39.134
<i>leave me a message.</i>

44:43.839 --> 44:45.641
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.643
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

44:50.279 --> 44:52.247
Idiots.

44:52.247 --> 44:53.582
I-I agree.

44:53.582 --> 44:55.150
I do.

44:55.150 --> 44:56.285
Hi.

44:56.285 --> 44:59.154
Hi.
This is Alex...

44:59.154 --> 45:00.522
I forgot your last name.

45:00.522 --> 45:01.757
- Forrest.
- Alex Forrest,

45:01.757 --> 45:04.560
my husband Dan.
Dan, Alex Forrest.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.361
No, I know him already. Oh.

45:06.361 --> 45:09.731
From, uh, the criminal courts.

45:09.731 --> 45:11.600
- I work in Victim Services.
- Oh.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.236
That's... with Conchita, right?

45:14.236 --> 45:16.472
- Right.
- Wow, are you kidding?

45:16.472 --> 45:18.474
You were right, Beth.

45:18.474 --> 45:20.843
This place, I mean, it's...

45:20.843 --> 45:22.110
It's magical.

45:22.110 --> 45:25.681
Well, we've been
very happy here.

45:26.782 --> 45:29.117
I can feel it.

45:29.117 --> 45:30.652
The happiness.

45:34.456 --> 45:36.225
Thank you so much.
Of course.

45:36.225 --> 45:39.261
And, uh, yeah,
maybe I'll see you around.

45:46.502 --> 45:48.704
What do you think?
She really in the market?

45:48.704 --> 45:50.606
Um...

45:50.606 --> 45:52.841
I mean, yeah,
I don't know, maybe.

46:04.953 --> 46:07.222
Earl.

46:08.290 --> 46:10.225
So they gave you parole, huh?

46:10.225 --> 46:12.160
Yep, that's what they did.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.262
And you haven't lost the gift
of the blarney then

46:13.262 --> 46:14.229
because that is total bullshit.

46:14.229 --> 46:15.631
So let me guess.

46:15.631 --> 46:17.599
You want to talk about your case

46:17.599 --> 46:18.867
and all the things that I
would've done differently

46:18.867 --> 46:20.168
in retrospect,
which is none of them.

46:20.168 --> 46:21.436
Earl, can we do this inside?

46:21.436 --> 46:23.839
Yeah, I'm not doing it
at all, Mikey.

46:23.839 --> 46:25.574
That case was so solid
it could make me a sandwich.

46:25.574 --> 46:28.377
Can you just listen? Please, you
don't even have to talk.

46:28.377 --> 46:30.712
- Can I? Sure. Will I?
- Earl, will you cut the shit?

46:30.712 --> 46:32.347
Yeah, but you know what's
pretty crazy, though?

46:32.347 --> 46:33.715
That you're letting him
drag you into this.

46:33.715 --> 46:35.284
I mean, I would say
"have you no shame?"

46:35.284 --> 46:37.619
But as we all found out
a while ago,

46:37.619 --> 46:39.655
you don't.

46:46.013 --> 46:47.848
<i>I don't, I don't...
I don't understand</i>

46:47.848 --> 46:49.583
<i>w-what did he want you to say?</i>

46:49.583 --> 46:51.485
I don't know. It's like...

46:51.485 --> 46:53.520
<i>the shittiness of his situation</i>

46:53.520 --> 46:55.856
<i>was why he was supposed
to be the one to say</i>

46:55.856 --> 46:59.026
how things were gonna go,
but then it was also why

46:59.026 --> 47:00.828
we weren't supposed
to listen to him.

47:00.828 --> 47:02.663
<i>Don't try to logic this.</i>

47:02.663 --> 47:06.300
<i>No, he got to tell us
what to do then, so...</i>

47:06.300 --> 47:08.469
now he also gets to tell us how
we should've felt about it.

47:08.469 --> 47:09.970
Or something.

47:09.970 --> 47:13.007
What? Please, just let me get
my scissors and go.

47:13.007 --> 47:14.942
<i>You know that he thinks
you're a part of it too, Dad?</i>

47:14.942 --> 47:17.444
Part of why we never--
<i>He said that?</i>

47:17.444 --> 47:19.313
<i>I mean, kind of, yeah.</i>

47:19.313 --> 47:20.481
Do you think he has a point?

47:20.481 --> 47:22.583
- About me being--
- About any of it.

47:23.717 --> 47:26.353
<i>Ellie, do you think that
I should've tried to keep him</i>

47:26.353 --> 47:29.923
more actively in your mind?
Should I have reached out

47:29.923 --> 47:32.526
<i>after however many years
to see if he</i>

47:32.526 --> 47:33.661
changed his mind, to check?

47:33.661 --> 47:36.530
Honestly?

47:36.530 --> 47:38.365
Those seem like
crazy things to expect,

47:38.365 --> 47:41.835
but I didn't lose my whole life.

47:41.835 --> 47:44.772
I don't know what
it's like to be him.

47:44.772 --> 47:46.907
<i>But also it sounds
like that shadow stuff</i>

47:46.907 --> 47:49.376
<i>that you were talking about,
isn't it, Ellie?</i>

47:49.376 --> 47:52.680
If it isn't part of us,
it doesn't bother us.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.615
If you ask me,
he's mad at you guys

47:54.615 --> 47:56.483
because he's mad at himself

47:56.483 --> 48:00.020
and-and... and he knows he
doesn't get to be mad, but...

48:00.020 --> 48:03.490
I mean, that...
doesn't mean he isn't.

48:06.760 --> 48:08.062
What the fuck was that?

48:08.062 --> 48:09.663
I was going to call you.

48:09.663 --> 48:10.831
I don't know what you
think you're doing,

48:10.831 --> 48:12.066
but it's going to stop.

48:12.066 --> 48:13.600
- Right now.
- It's not going to stop.

48:13.600 --> 48:16.637
- Why would it stop?
- Why?

48:17.638 --> 48:20.741
Because you are not going
to come into my home,

48:20.741 --> 48:23.444
into my private life,
and threaten me and my family.

48:23.444 --> 48:26.447
What are you talking...?
I-I didn't do that.

48:26.447 --> 48:28.782
How could I do that?

48:29.983 --> 48:31.885
Dan, wh...?

48:31.885 --> 48:33.454
What are you so afraid of?

48:33.454 --> 48:34.988
Really, you remember
what it was like.

48:34.988 --> 48:37.558
Right? You remember
what you were--

48:37.558 --> 48:38.892
Stop! Just stop this!

48:38.892 --> 48:41.095
I spoke to the hospital
about Tracy.

48:41.095 --> 48:43.063
And I don't know what
fucking insanity...

48:43.063 --> 48:46.133
Why you would even <i>try</i>
to do something like that,

48:46.133 --> 48:48.001
but I could end your career.

48:48.001 --> 48:50.771
And if you come after
my family again, I will.

49:02.015 --> 49:03.150
You know, some people would say

49:03.150 --> 49:05.419
it doesn't count
as a kitchenette

49:05.419 --> 49:08.555
if there's a stovetop
and a fridge.

49:09.590 --> 49:10.824
But no sink.

49:10.824 --> 49:12.392
Well, there's a sink
in the bathroom.

49:12.392 --> 49:13.927
Yes. Exactly.

49:13.927 --> 49:16.096
And the rest is my office,
which I don't even use.

49:16.096 --> 49:18.065
Because I do everything
on my phone.

49:20.567 --> 49:22.169
Now, we just can't
ever find a tenant

49:22.169 --> 49:23.504
that you can peacefully
coexist with.

49:23.504 --> 49:25.506
One was too friendly,

49:25.506 --> 49:27.174
one was hiding a cat,

49:27.174 --> 49:29.476
and one had doll eyes,
whatever that means.

49:29.476 --> 49:30.577
Oh, I know exactly
what that means.

49:30.577 --> 49:32.079
Well, we'd be giving you

49:32.079 --> 49:35.949
an extremely competitive
monthly rate of... nothing?

49:35.949 --> 49:38.051
At least for now.

49:38.051 --> 49:39.486
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

49:41.421 --> 49:44.625
But when I come in here,
I get to sit in my chair, hmm?

49:44.625 --> 49:47.528
Ah. Honestly, you'd be doing us
a favor, though.

49:47.528 --> 49:50.464
You know Mom,
she's on the ball for 92, but...

49:50.464 --> 49:54.001
man, her bones
are like rice noodles.

49:54.001 --> 49:55.602
Ugh.

49:59.773 --> 50:01.008
This is amazing, Mike,
thank you.

50:01.008 --> 50:03.577
You are welcome. Oh, shit.

50:04.645 --> 50:06.647
A set of prints
came back already.

50:06.647 --> 50:08.949
That's fast. Why so fast?

50:08.949 --> 50:10.551
Because the guy they belong to

50:10.551 --> 50:13.687
is in prison now apparently, Calipatria.

50:13.687 --> 50:16.490
Some...

50:16.490 --> 50:19.059
pill mill doctor, drug dealer
guy, Paul Halliwell?

50:19.059 --> 50:21.195
Mean anything to you?

50:21.195 --> 50:22.696
Hmm? No? But it will.

50:22.696 --> 50:25.966
Uh, first we got to get
your stuff, huh?

50:25.966 --> 50:27.601
Sorry there's no bathtub.

50:29.102 --> 50:30.737
You know, not something
I really missed.

50:30.737 --> 50:32.906
Yeah, you know, you see enough
crime scene photos

50:32.906 --> 50:34.875
of the creative ways
that people use bathtubs,

50:34.875 --> 50:36.210
they kind of lose their charm.

50:37.644 --> 50:39.012
<i>I need you.</i>

50:39.012 --> 50:41.014
<i>Please, I don't care
if you're not</i>

50:41.014 --> 50:45.018
certified in California,
just please just call me back.

51:08.041 --> 51:09.810
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:09.810 --> 51:12.512
Hey, um, are we supposed to,
like, sign in or something?

51:12.512 --> 51:14.882
No, no, but if you need
somewhere to leave your shoes,

51:14.882 --> 51:16.583
Lorena is gonna
watch 'em while we skate.

51:16.583 --> 51:17.951
Cool.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.555
It's fine.
Just put them there.

51:23.924 --> 51:26.827
God, everybody here
is like really good, huh?

51:26.827 --> 51:28.629
How good are you at this?

51:28.629 --> 51:29.830
More towards the front?

51:29.830 --> 51:31.031
- Middle?
- No, no, the back.

51:31.031 --> 51:32.833
Uh, the back of the back.

51:32.833 --> 51:34.902
- Even though you own skates?
- That I thrifted for this.

51:34.902 --> 51:37.137
- Oh, God. Oh. Oh, yep. Yep.
- Maybe you want a little help?

51:37.137 --> 51:39.773
Oh, yep. Could you just shield
me from ridicule for a second?

51:39.773 --> 51:41.575
All right, all right.
Hi. You're good.

51:41.575 --> 51:42.843
Hi.

51:42.843 --> 51:44.144
Hey. I feel like I know you.

51:44.144 --> 51:45.879
Do you T.A. for Macksey?

51:45.879 --> 51:47.147
Yeah, for Macksey.

51:47.147 --> 51:48.849
- Macksey. Yeah.
- Okay.

51:48.849 --> 51:50.117
- Okay. All right.
- Cool.

51:50.117 --> 51:52.052
- You want to...? Okay.
- Yeah, sure.

51:52.052 --> 51:53.186
- Hold on to my hips? Hold on.
- Let's do it. Yeah. Definitely.

51:53.186 --> 51:55.656
Okay.

52:03.797 --> 52:05.332
Oh, my God.

52:05.332 --> 52:07.034
This is crazy.
Why the fuck are we doing this?

52:07.034 --> 52:09.236
I don't know, I don't know.

52:33.694 --> 52:35.062
Oh, my God.

52:40.334 --> 52:43.070
Ugh.

With this episode,

54:10.962 --> 54:15.033
I like this peek behind
the curtain for Alex.

54:15.033 --> 54:16.935
I want to know
why she thinks

54:16.935 --> 54:17.629
these decisions
that she's making
