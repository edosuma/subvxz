00:04.166 --> 00:05.458
Oh, Toby.

00:06.041 --> 00:08.250
I think you're my cutest baby yet.

00:08.458 --> 00:09.333
Hey.

00:09.792 --> 00:10.625
Oh.

00:11.417 --> 00:12.583
My cutest boy baby.

00:12.834 --> 00:13.834
Hey.

00:15.667 --> 00:16.500
Oh!

00:16.583 --> 00:19.250
Oh, I think cutest boy baby
just had a little spit up.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.458
Oh. Where's my "up man"?

00:21.083 --> 00:21.959
Up man!

00:22.083 --> 00:23.041
What's an up man?

00:23.125 --> 00:24.709
You know, he takes care of the "ups."

00:25.208 --> 00:27.625
Spit-up, clean-up, throw-up.

00:29.041 --> 00:29.959
I'm here.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.166
Thank you.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.750
Why do I have to be the up man?

00:34.834 --> 00:37.083
Because you... uh...

00:37.166 --> 00:38.625
Why is it we're punishing him again?

00:39.208 --> 00:40.291
Well, because he...

00:42.208 --> 00:43.291
He's Gabe.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.500
We know he did something.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.834
- Yep.
- Yeah. Probably.

Huh.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.291
Speaking of tomorrow, pretty, uh...

01:50.375 --> 01:51.542
Pretty special day, huh?

01:51.625 --> 01:52.875
It won't be for anyone

01:52.959 --> 01:54.041
who drinks that milk.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.709
No, silly. Tomorrow is ten months.

01:58.792 --> 01:59.625
Ten months?

02:00.125 --> 02:01.333
Since we...

02:01.583 --> 02:02.959
Since we...

02:04.709 --> 02:06.583
Since we got back together.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.834
Tomorrow is our ten-month-aversary.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.333
Right, no. I'm just messing with you.

02:11.583 --> 02:13.000
Tomorrow night, I'm...

02:13.333 --> 02:16.834
taking you out to a special fancy dinner.

02:19.125 --> 02:20.667
So you really remembered?

02:20.750 --> 02:22.250
Yeah, no. Of course. Of...

02:22.625 --> 02:24.208
- Check out my calendar.
- Teddy: Hmm.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.083
Tomorrow's date has a heart on it.

02:28.625 --> 02:29.959
- Let me see.
- Hang on.

02:32.375 --> 02:33.333
Hang on.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.208
All right, here we go. See?

02:37.959 --> 02:39.375
And that's a puppy.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.625
Hang on. Hang on.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.083
Gosh, with everyone helping out,

02:49.166 --> 02:52.500
Toby's first week at home
has been absolutely wonderful.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.750
Surprise!

02:55.625 --> 02:57.083
- Mom!
- Teddy: Grandma.

02:57.166 --> 02:59.000
- Hey.
- Aww.

02:59.625 --> 03:00.625
- Teddy: Hello.
- Hi.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.667
And the week just keeps getting better.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.166
What are you doing here?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.500
With your suitcase?

03:06.417 --> 03:08.667
Oh! What kind of a grandmother would I be

03:08.750 --> 03:11.375
if I didn't come to see
my new grandson and whatnot?

03:13.458 --> 03:14.875
Mom, you're the best.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.166
Oh, thank you, honey.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.542
- You look wonderful.
- Oh!

03:17.625 --> 03:18.458
Mm-hm.

03:19.041 --> 03:21.125
And Amy, you're still wearing
that same outfit.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.125
I never get tired of seeing it.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.792
I like presents.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.208
Oh. I remembered that.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.917
Do you want to look in the bag?

03:33.291 --> 03:34.250
I like cash.

03:35.792 --> 03:37.166
I'm on a fixed income.

03:39.917 --> 03:41.417
Amy, I'm not here on vacation.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.000
I'm here to help out
with the chores and whatnot.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.083
No more chitchat. I wanna see my Toby.

03:49.792 --> 03:51.000
Oh, my.

03:51.542 --> 03:54.792
What a handsome boy you are, Toby.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.208
Are you gonna look like a movie star,
just like your daddy?

04:01.625 --> 04:03.500
When was the last time
she went to a movie?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.125
- Oh, hey, Mrs. Dabney.
- Hmm...

04:12.583 --> 04:14.583
Guess it's old lady day
here at the Duncan house.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.208
This is for you.

04:17.417 --> 04:19.750
It's some old baby stuff
I found in my attic.

04:20.250 --> 04:23.125
I mean, as long as you people
keep having babies every five minutes.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.125
Oh. Check out this old rattle.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.792
That was my son Rodney's.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.166
He loved that thing.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.792
The rhythmic noise
would just mesmerize his little mind.

04:37.625 --> 04:38.458
PJ.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.041
Hmm?

04:40.125 --> 04:41.208
Oh, hi, Mrs. Dabney.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.834
You know, there might be some things here

04:45.917 --> 04:47.709
that you boys would be interested in.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.041
We don't want your old junk.

04:49.125 --> 04:49.959
Fine.

04:50.041 --> 04:53.542
I'll just throw these old comics
and baseball cards away then.

04:53.625 --> 04:54.667
No, no, no! I mean...

04:54.750 --> 04:56.917
We'll... we'll take them, but you owe us.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.375
And now, the best part of my day...

05:01.834 --> 05:02.750
Leaving.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.750
Stop that.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.625
Oh, hey, Gabe.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.542
Hi, honey.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.500
Hey, what's going on?

05:18.583 --> 05:19.959
Oh, nothing much.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.000
This and that.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.333
Oh, there was one more little thing.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.458
What was it, what was it, what was it?

05:25.583 --> 05:27.667
Oh, yeah. I can't stand grandma.

05:30.375 --> 05:32.750
But she's the sweetest lady in the world.

05:32.834 --> 05:33.709
No, no. No. No.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.333
She's the sweetest lady in the world.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.583
And whatnot.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.458
Yeah, she does say that a lot,
doesn't she?

05:41.250 --> 05:42.250
It's not just that.

05:42.375 --> 05:45.208
It... It's the voice, and smile,
and the comments,

05:45.250 --> 05:46.417
and the "Bobby's a movie star."

05:46.500 --> 05:48.709
Please. If anyone's around here's
a movie star, it's me.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.083
Well...

05:51.166 --> 05:53.083
Mom, she's only gonna be here
for two more days.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.333
Can't you just get through it?

05:55.041 --> 05:56.125
I don't know.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.166
After the baby, I'm all hormonal. Just...

06:01.250 --> 06:03.125
I don't have my usual censor.

06:03.291 --> 06:04.458
You have a censor?

06:06.291 --> 06:08.041
Teddy, you have to help me, okay?

06:08.125 --> 06:09.834
You gotta keep grandma away from me.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.709
Yeah, sure.
I... I love spending time with grandma.

06:12.917 --> 06:17.125
And just in case she gets on my nerves,
we need a code word.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.125
You know, something I can say
in case I'm about to blow.

06:21.709 --> 06:23.417
Platypi.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.667
That's a fun word.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.834
It's the plural for platypus.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.542
Oh, honey.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.792
I need something
that I can work into a conversation.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.166
Um...

06:32.959 --> 06:33.792
Apple.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.250
I was at the zoo and I saw two platypi.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.583
How easy is that?

06:41.125 --> 06:42.083
We'll go with apple.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.083
Meh.

06:51.709 --> 06:52.542
No.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.250
Oh. Hey.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.208
Check out this old comic book.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.000
"Gila Monster Man."

06:59.917 --> 07:01.750
"Gila Monster Man"? What's that about?

07:01.834 --> 07:05.583
"By day, he's mild-mannered photographer,
Gil A. Muenster.

07:05.667 --> 07:09.375
By night, he's a crime-fighting superhero,
Gila Monster Man."

07:09.667 --> 07:10.917
All right, what's his superpower?

07:11.208 --> 07:13.125
"When he hides under hot rocks,

07:13.208 --> 07:14.709
his body temperature rises

07:14.792 --> 07:17.125
and gives him the ability
to scorch villains."

07:17.208 --> 07:18.166
Ew.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.750
I'd hate to be the geek
with that lunch box.

07:22.417 --> 07:23.333
You know?

07:24.750 --> 07:26.417
- What's that?
- Just some old letter.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.417
Hey, it's dated July 9, 1924.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.125
- Wow.
- Listen to this.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.500
"My dearest brother,

07:35.917 --> 07:37.375
as I am very ill,

07:37.500 --> 07:39.625
I send you this letter with great urgency.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.250
As you know, in spite of my great wealth,

07:42.333 --> 07:44.542
I have had a lifelong distrust of banks."

07:45.000 --> 07:47.208
What does Gila Monster Man
do during the winter?

07:47.250 --> 07:48.458
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.041
Blah, blah, blah...

07:52.458 --> 07:54.709
"All my money is buried
in the backyard of my home,

07:54.792 --> 07:56.834
ten feet due East from the oak tree,

07:57.041 --> 07:58.542
and four feet deep.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.500
With loving regard,
your brother, Orville."

08:00.583 --> 08:01.709
Wait a minute, look at this.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.667
He lived in Mrs. Dabney's house.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.625
And the letter was never mailed.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.834
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

08:07.917 --> 08:09.083
We gotta get to the post office.

08:12.208 --> 08:15.083
PJ, the letter was never mailed.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.291
No one knows about the money.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.250
It's probably still there.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.875
So when Mrs. Dabney's gone,

08:22.291 --> 08:24.375
- we go dig it up.
- Oh.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.709
And we're rich.

08:25.792 --> 08:27.208
Well, of course, the right thing to do

08:27.250 --> 08:29.125
would be to split it evenly
with Mrs. Dabney.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.250
We're gonna do the wrong thing,
though, aren't we?

08:38.083 --> 08:39.083
Move it back.

08:39.709 --> 08:40.625
There.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.583
Now, isn't that better, Bobby?

08:42.792 --> 08:44.000
It is better, Mommy.

08:45.000 --> 08:45.834
Hi.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.041
What's going on?

08:48.125 --> 08:50.625
Oh, just a little rearranging and whatnot.

08:50.709 --> 08:51.667
Oh.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.792
Is that a good idea?

08:54.083 --> 08:57.083
Oh, yes. It's an ancient Chinese art.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.792
It's called "fung shooey."

09:02.583 --> 09:04.709
Hey, hon. Come on in here a second.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.959
Huh? What do you think?

09:09.667 --> 09:10.750
Love it.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.667
It's easier to clean this way.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.625
I know that's always been
a challenge for you.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.500
Apple.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.333
What?

09:22.417 --> 09:26.375
Mom's probably just talking about
what we're gonna have for dinner tonight.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.417
Apple?

09:28.458 --> 09:30.834
Don't you think we need something
a little more filling?

09:32.417 --> 09:33.250
Apple.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.834
Grandma, you haven't seen my room.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.041
Come see my room.

09:37.792 --> 09:38.667
Okay.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.333
So, like a caramel apple?

09:50.417 --> 09:52.458
Thanks for the tour of your room,
sweetheart.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.125
It was certainly thorough.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.583
Oh, no. Uh, wait.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.834
Um... Let's do something.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.041
You know, just you and me.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.667
I need some more grandma time.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.709
All righty.

10:04.792 --> 10:09.000
I'm not sure you're going to enjoy it,
but I have an idea that might be fun.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.250
Extreme couponing.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.125
Extreme couponing?

10:16.250 --> 10:18.417
Well, let me explain how it works.

10:18.959 --> 10:20.458
Now this one's worth 50 cents,

10:20.542 --> 10:22.083
but it's a double coupon,

10:22.166 --> 10:24.333
which means it's actually worth a dollar.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.083
Cool!

10:26.208 --> 10:29.250
Oh. If I use this one
on a qualifying item,

10:29.333 --> 10:30.709
it's triple times the double.

10:31.041 --> 10:33.834
Believe it or not,
I once got a case of pickle relish

10:33.917 --> 10:35.000
for 12 cents.

10:35.959 --> 10:36.792
How was it?

10:37.166 --> 10:38.458
Well, I'm not a pickle person.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.542
Um...

10:42.917 --> 10:45.583
"Buy one five-pound bag of kitty litter,

10:45.667 --> 10:47.834
get the second bag free."

10:47.917 --> 10:49.583
Don't forget to triple your double.

10:50.834 --> 10:51.792
This is awesome.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.333
You know, we don't have a cat,
but if we did,

10:54.583 --> 10:56.083
he'd be pooping for free.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.041
Guys...

11:12.500 --> 11:14.583
I know I'm gonna regret
asking this, but...

11:16.458 --> 11:17.834
Where are you going with that stuff?

11:20.875 --> 11:22.375
- The library.
- We're in a play.

11:26.000 --> 11:26.834
Uh...

11:27.208 --> 11:29.291
We're in a play at the library.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.208
And what is the name of the play?

11:35.542 --> 11:36.542
Shovel...

11:38.250 --> 11:39.291
Kids.

11:42.083 --> 11:46.083
It's about kids
who carry around shovels...

11:47.583 --> 11:49.166
And make fun of the kids

11:49.458 --> 11:51.667
who carry around pickaxes.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.250
Pff.

11:55.375 --> 11:56.250
Dork.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.250
You should never make fun of someone
with a pickax.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.041
That's one of my lines.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.750
Okay.

12:08.709 --> 12:09.583
What you doing?

12:09.667 --> 12:12.375
Oh, wanna get my facts straight...

12:13.333 --> 12:14.375
Just on the off chance

12:14.458 --> 12:16.917
I have to fill out
a police report later on.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.667
Oh, five hours of couponing.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.291
That was quite a sesh.

12:34.375 --> 12:38.625
Grandma, is it normal to see dotted lines
everywhere you look?

12:39.542 --> 12:40.834
I'm gonna head upstairs.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.375
Oh, no, um...

12:43.125 --> 12:44.417
Let's do something else fun.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.792
Oh, but your mother
probably needs my help and whatnot.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.959
- But I need your help down here.
- With what?

12:51.041 --> 12:51.959
With, um...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.625
Uh... With...

12:55.875 --> 12:57.166
A makeover.

12:58.875 --> 13:01.125
You want me to give you a makeover?

13:01.667 --> 13:02.709
Yeah, I mean, you know,

13:02.792 --> 13:05.875
I've... I've been feeling kind of bored
with my look.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.291
And you have such a great sense of style.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.291
Well, I did pack
an extra can of hair spray.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.709
Oh, no.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.542
Bob, honey, you're not a movie star.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.834
I've got something to show you.

13:30.417 --> 13:33.125
May I present the new and improved,

13:33.208 --> 13:34.208
Teddy Duncan.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.000
Teddy, what happened?

13:43.917 --> 13:45.000
Oh, um...

13:45.083 --> 13:47.750
Grandma gave me a makeover.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.417
So we could spend more time together.

13:50.750 --> 13:52.000
And whatnot.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.291
And that's not all.

13:56.542 --> 13:57.667
Linda: Come on, sweetie.

13:57.917 --> 13:58.709
Come on.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.125
Let's go. Oh! Come on!

14:03.458 --> 14:04.709
My hair is hard.

14:09.875 --> 14:10.875
Hello...

14:11.250 --> 14:12.166
ma'am?

14:13.166 --> 14:15.125
Oh! No.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.542
Today is our ten-month-aversary dinner.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.125
I totally forgot.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.500
Well, when you get older...

14:22.792 --> 14:24.458
Who's this handsome fellow?

14:24.542 --> 14:27.166
Oh, grandma, this is my boyfriend Spencer.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.834
- Oh!
- Spencer, this is grandma Linda.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.000
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.875
I can see the family resemblance.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.542
All righty. Well, let me just go
change real quick.

14:37.542 --> 14:40.375
Why do you need to change?
We just got you fixed up.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.792
Yes, we did. Um...

14:46.625 --> 14:48.834
I guess we're ready to go then.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.208
Oh. You know what? I gotta go, too.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.208
It's bowling night.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.250
So...

14:53.709 --> 14:56.166
Teddy's going to dinner,
and you're going bowling?

14:56.250 --> 14:57.250
Where are the boys?

14:57.333 --> 15:00.208
Uh. They might be at the library,
but I doubt it.

15:08.875 --> 15:09.792
Well, Linda...

15:10.750 --> 15:12.166
Looks like it's just you and me tonight.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.083
Apple?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.333
Or...

15:19.625 --> 15:20.875
Happy anniversary.

15:33.041 --> 15:36.208
You know, this would go a lot faster
if you helped me dig.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.875
PJ, in every partnership,
there's labor and there's management.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.291
- Why am I labor?
- Because I'm management.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.583
Wait, stop.

15:48.834 --> 15:50.291
I just heard Mrs. Dabney pull up.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.625
- Come on!
- Come on. All right.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.500
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Don't rush me.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.792
I'm not 12 anymore.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.000
Here you go.

16:19.083 --> 16:22.208
And for you, ladies, the senior menu.

16:23.959 --> 16:26.041
Um, could I have a regular menu?

16:26.125 --> 16:27.417
I'm... I'm 17.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.583
What a great attitude!

16:32.500 --> 16:35.834
It's sweet of you kids to invite me,
but I feel like I'm in the way.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.417
Oh, no.
Of course I want you here, grandma.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.834
I've got my favorite guy,

16:40.875 --> 16:42.500
my awesome grandma,

16:42.583 --> 16:45.208
my great new look...

16:45.959 --> 16:47.750
It's all coming together, right, Spencer?

16:47.834 --> 16:48.667
You bet.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.250
Especially since both of your meals
will be half off.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.000
Oh, which reminds me,
I left my coupon in the car.

16:55.083 --> 16:55.959
Excuse me.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.792
He's a couponer, too?

17:01.875 --> 17:03.458
You'd better hang on to him.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.625
Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't order milk.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.083
They're from the gentlemen at table seven.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.041
What's going on here?

17:26.166 --> 17:28.250
Just admiring my new hot tub.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.458
And may I say, thank you, boys.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.208
That hole you dug saved me a lot of money.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.667
We weren't digging the hole for a hot tub.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.542
There's a fortune down there.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.166
Why are you laughing?

17:42.250 --> 17:44.458
And why would you put
a hot tub over a fortune?

17:44.542 --> 17:46.208
That's so stupid.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.500
She tricked us.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.208
She wrote the letter.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.875
- She did?
- I did.

17:53.458 --> 17:56.375
She knew we'd dig the hole
exactly where she wanted it.

17:56.792 --> 17:57.875
We're the stupid ones.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.709
- We are?
- You are.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.542
Where's grandma?
She's been in the bathroom a long time.

18:10.917 --> 18:11.959
Oh, um, excuse me.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.000
Have you seen the woman
who was sitting with us?

18:14.083 --> 18:15.750
Yes. She just got into a cab.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.750
Something about wanting you guys
to have some private time and whatnot.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.667
Oh, no. She's going home!

18:23.417 --> 18:25.083
- Platypi!
- What?

18:25.750 --> 18:26.709
Platypi.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.166
Aren't you loving the new setup?

18:34.333 --> 18:35.250
Uh-huh.

18:36.291 --> 18:39.959
It takes all the negative energy
and pushes it right through the door.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.417
Not all of it.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.834
We'll be "fung shooing"
the kitchen tomorrow.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.917
No, no, no. Nothing's wrong
with the kitchen.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.250
You're right.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.583
You can't blame the kitchen
for what goes on in there.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.083
Hi.

18:55.542 --> 18:56.458
What's going on?

18:56.542 --> 18:57.959
Apple, apple, apple!

18:59.667 --> 19:01.083
Why do you keep saying that?

19:01.166 --> 19:03.750
Oh, it's just this fun thing that we do.

19:03.834 --> 19:06.917
She says that and then
I answer back, "pie, pie, pie!"

19:08.125 --> 19:10.750
No. No! I can't do this anymore.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.041
You can't do what anymore?

19:12.125 --> 19:13.000
This!

19:13.083 --> 19:16.542
Smiling like a ninny
while you drive me out of my mind.

19:17.125 --> 19:21.542
Well, I agree, you do smile like a ninny
but I can't see where it's my fault.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.291
See? There it goes again.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.041
You know, the little digs,
and the comments,

19:25.125 --> 19:26.834
and the rearranging, and whatnot.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.291
Whatnot, whatnot, whatnot!

19:28.375 --> 19:29.750
What does that even mean?

19:33.250 --> 19:35.417
I... I never knew you felt this way.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.834
Well, 'cause I've been keeping it inside
for the last 20 years.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.875
And now that I've said it,
I feel terrible.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.375
I'm so sorry, Linda.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.333
Oh, I'm a horrible person.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.208
Oh, no, no.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.041
You're not a horrible person.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.959
You're a wonderful girl.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.625
Who just happened to marry
very, very well.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.875
And you've given
this family a wonderful life.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.875
Bobby's lucky to have you.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.083
Thank you.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.041
You know, as hard as it was to hear,

20:12.291 --> 20:13.834
I appreciate your honesty.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.875
And I appreciate your appreciation.

20:18.542 --> 20:21.250
This is nice. This is good.

20:21.458 --> 20:24.500
Well, as long as we're being honest,

20:25.083 --> 20:28.875
I have some things
I'd like to share about you.

20:29.792 --> 20:30.834
Um. No.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.041
I think we're good.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.041
I think we've made enough
progress for today.

20:34.125 --> 20:36.166
Come on, ladies. Let's bring it in.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.333
Family hug.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.792
Hey, everybody. Back from bowling.

20:51.166 --> 20:55.333
Well, Charlie, grandma's gone home,
and everything is back to normal.

20:55.709 --> 20:56.417
Huh.

20:57.792 --> 21:00.417
Look at that.
I really don't have a bad side.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.333
Well, maybe not everything.

21:08.792 --> 21:09.667
I'll get it.

21:17.333 --> 21:20.083
May I speak to PJ and Gabe?

21:22.792 --> 21:23.750
Mrs. Dabney.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.291
You got a... You got a little something.

21:27.792 --> 21:31.542
Someone put food coloring in my hot tub.

21:31.625 --> 21:32.625
Ah.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.542
Boys, you have a visitor.

21:36.625 --> 21:39.750
You'd better wish your brothers
some good luck, Charlie.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.625
Narrator: And now,
the continuing adventures of...

21:44.709 --> 21:46.250
Gila Monster Man!

21:48.208 --> 21:50.333
That's some sandwich, eh, Muenster?

21:50.500 --> 21:51.625
Sure is, Chief.

21:53.458 --> 21:55.667
Chief! I just got a scoop.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.917
Doctor Scorpion's robbed another bank.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.041
Great googly-moogly!

22:02.083 --> 22:03.208
That fiend.

22:03.834 --> 22:05.667
Boy, I'd love to squash that bug.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.709
Like you could do anything.

22:07.917 --> 22:09.667
You're just mild-mannered
news photographer,

22:09.750 --> 22:10.875
Gil A. Muenster.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.959
Not a real hero like Gila Monster Man.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.166
Well, you've got me there.

22:18.709 --> 22:20.083
Wait! Where are you going?

22:20.166 --> 22:21.333
To find a hot rock!

22:23.375 --> 22:24.250
I mean...

22:24.375 --> 22:25.250
The bathroom.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.500
Gila Monster Man!

22:32.583 --> 22:34.208
Where'd you come from?

22:34.250 --> 22:35.250
No time to talk.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.041
Doctor Scorpion's on the loose.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.291
Muenster, quick, get a picture.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.625
Where is that bumbling idiot?
