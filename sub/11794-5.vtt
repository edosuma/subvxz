00:03.969 --> 00:06.873
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.906 --> 00:09.909
  <i>* I don't think</i>
  <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.943 --> 00:12.812
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:16.315

 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.349 --> 00:21.921

00:21.955 --> 00:25.025

00:25.058 --> 00:28.061

01:11.938 --> 01:14.874
 Slater, we are a great team.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
   We are not only going to get
   an A on this project,

01:17.110 --> 01:19.179
   but we are also going to win
   that science medal.

01:19.212 --> 01:22.315
   Hey, and all we have to
   do now is just pick a name
   for the volcano.

01:22.349 --> 01:26.086
   Oh, if you don't mind, I was
   thinking of
   Mount Saint Jessie.

01:26.119 --> 01:29.689
   Uh, how about,
   Slater's Crater?

01:29.723 --> 01:33.426
 All right, I'll compromise.
 We'll call it Jessie's Crater.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.962
Come on, let's see
how she works.

01:38.131 --> 01:41.835
 No, no, come on. You've got
 to pour in more. Let me do it.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.837
Be careful!
Don't pour in too mu...

01:43.870 --> 01:45.271
  How do you get
  this thing to stop?

01:45.305 --> 01:47.340
 I don't know.
 I was absent that day.
 Come on.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.209
  I told you not
  to pour so much in.

01:49.242 --> 01:53.013
  Do you know how hard
  it is to get lava stains out
  of your clothes?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.116
 You see that?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.984
  In four days,
  my science project is due.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.921
  If I don't get an A,
  I'll be doing
  hard time in summer school.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.925
Screech! What are you doing
with our project?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.260
  You're supposed to be
  home working on it.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.661
   I needed a break.

02:08.695 --> 02:09.929
 Hey, you know our arrangement,

02:09.963 --> 02:11.931
  you do the work,
  I take the breaks.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.367
 Well,
 aren't you going to do any
 work at all, Zack?

02:14.401 --> 02:18.238
 Well, no.
 lf I worked on it, you'd
 just have to do it over again.

02:18.271 --> 02:21.408
 I'm saving you time,
 and that's the thanks I get.

02:21.441 --> 02:25.378
 I'm sorry.
 Thanks, Zack.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.947
  - What is that thing?
  - It's our science project.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.184
  It's an electro-magnetic
  aerial hymenoptera detector.

02:31.217 --> 02:34.721
 - What's it do?
 - Zack: What's it do?

02:35.355 --> 02:38.091
What's it do, Screech?

02:38.091 --> 02:43.163
 Well, right now,
 all it does is make
 my canary fly into the wall.

02:43.196 --> 02:46.199
   But once it's finished,
   it'll be
   an early warning system.

02:46.232 --> 02:48.868
   - For what?
   - Enemy canaries.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.173
 Look, guys.
 There she is.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.242
My dream girl.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.411
 Screech, if you
 really like Lisa, go for it.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.046
  Let her know how you feel.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.816
  - You really think so?
  - Absolutely. Don't give up.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.151
 - Give love a chance.
 - Oh, I agree.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.721
 Why don't we go
 to the drive-in
 and give it a chance?

03:07.754 --> 03:11.224
  Well, I'm afraid
  I'll fall off your bicycle.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.326
  I'm making my move.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.296
  Don't do it. Screech,
  love and science don't mix.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.799
Did you ever see
Einstein with a chick?

03:19.833 --> 03:22.469
No, Zack.
Kelly's right.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.772
  This is my one moment
  in time.

03:25.805 --> 03:28.742
 ( soft romantic music plays )

03:50.230 --> 03:52.932
I guess I caught her
at a bad time.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.969
   Well, don't give up.
   He's really not her type.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.305
   They must be serious.
   He's chewing her gum now.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.777
   I don't understand.
   Why don't girls like me?

04:03.810 --> 04:05.111
  Oh!

04:05.145 --> 04:07.914
 I have some theories.

04:07.947 --> 04:10.917
Me too.
I'm snake spit.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.431
 Hey, Screech, would you
 turn on the machine?

04:24.464 --> 04:26.833
 Turn it on yourself.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.578
  Hey, would you
  forget about Lisa?

04:38.611 --> 04:41.548
 Look, I'm positive I can find
 another girl who'll like you.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.217
 - You really mean it?
 - Yeah, absolutely.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.952
   Before you even
   approach a girl,

04:45.985 --> 04:47.921
   you gotta act like
   you believe in yourself.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.090
   Let me see that.
   Come on.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.097
  That's it?

04:57.097 --> 04:59.899
 I don't have much
 to believe in, Zack.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.202
  You gotta practice
  being cool.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.071
 What you need is
 a great opening line,

05:05.105 --> 05:08.074
something to grab
her attention.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.476
 How about, "Hello''?

05:09.509 --> 05:12.278
If you say hello,
you'll hear "Goodbye."

05:12.312 --> 05:15.081
  It's better than
  what I usually get.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.950
What I mean is,

05:17.050 --> 05:19.052
   "Hey, how much did the other
   contestants pay you

05:19.085 --> 05:21.421
 to drop out
 of the Miss Universe contest?"

05:21.454 --> 05:23.223
Wow, is that what
really goes on?

05:23.256 --> 05:26.526
No, you idiot! I'm just
showing you what to do.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.134
 Hey, there's Sally Dunsky.
 Go for it.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.437
   It's like shooting
   fish in a barrel.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.112
Are you looking
for something?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.181
 No babe, I found it.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.120
  Are you all right?

05:54.154 --> 05:58.358
  Hup! I learned that trick
  from the Chinese acrobats.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.027
  Your opening line!

06:01.027 --> 06:03.430
  Say something cool.

06:03.463 --> 06:07.500
   Did you know that worms
   are a source of protein?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.636
 Why don't you
 go eat some?

06:10.904 --> 06:13.206
The Miss Universe line.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.608
   What I meant to say was,

06:15.642 --> 06:17.477
"How much did you have
to pay the contestants

06:17.510 --> 06:20.480
  to get into
  the Miss Universe contest?"

06:20.513 --> 06:22.916
   Get lost, creep.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.418
   - How about lunch?
   - How about death?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.590
   Screech.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.260
Aw, Screech, come out.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.396
 Believe me, it's not
 the end of the world.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.065
  Ha!

06:39.065 --> 06:41.334
 Come on, talk to me, Screech.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.639
  Why can't I meet someone
  who will give me a chance?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.441
Someone who will ignore
my stupid hair

06:48.475 --> 06:51.978
 and my different-colored socks
 and see the real me.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.615
 - Well, that is the real you.
 - Yeah.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.251
  I'm hummingbird droppings.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.023
 Hey, you know, I just thought
 of someone who might like you.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.090
   Who? Who?

07:04.124 --> 07:06.526
 Take a few laps around the gym
 and let me work on it.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.695
   Sure thing, Zack.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.166
 Hey, Jessie, can I talk to you
 for a minute?
 I have a problem.

07:13.199 --> 07:17.037
   I know that Zack,
   but we've all
   learned to live with it.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.040
   No, no. I'm serious.
   See, I have this friend.

07:20.073 --> 07:23.410
  And girls don't like him
  because he looks different.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.379
 That's so unfair. It shouldn't
 matter what
 a person looks like.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.582
   Look at "Beauty and
   the Beast.'' He is
   a wonderful person inside.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.518
   So is my friend.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.287
He even smells better
than the Beast.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.623
 He just needs someone
 to give him a chance.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.358
   - I'll give him a chance.
   - Well, good!

07:38.391 --> 07:40.226
   If you like him, maybe
   you two can start dating?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.495
  - Maybe. Who is he?
  - Screech.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.733
Screech?
Are you crazy?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.602
  Me go out
  with Screech? Ugh!

07:51.237 --> 07:53.640
Is that a yes or a no?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.711
  Zack, I ran as fast
  as l could.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.213
 Did you talk to the girl?
 When can I meet her?

08:00.246 --> 08:04.084
Meet her? Gee, Screech,
I don't know.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.053
 Well, if I can't meet her,
 I'll call her.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.123
   Well,
   actually, maybe it would be
   better if she called you.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.359
   Yeah, yeah, that would work.
   As a matter of fact,

08:12.392 --> 08:14.728
she did say she'd call you.
3:30 at the payphone.

08:14.761 --> 08:16.262
   Zack, I owe you my life!

08:16.296 --> 08:17.630
 I'd rather have
 the science project.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.766
You got it.
All right! Woo!

08:22.202 --> 08:25.505
  Now all l have to do
  is find a girl for Screech.

08:30.643 --> 08:34.179
Well,
babe, let's be reasonable.
I can't come for lunch.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.750
 What do you mean,
 if I loved you I'd find a way?

08:36.783 --> 08:38.585
   You're in Italy.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.553
 Can you please hurry?

08:40.587 --> 08:42.688
    Hey this phone is
    <i>occupato, paisan.</i>

08:42.722 --> 08:47.060
   I need that phone, and
   I'm prepared to take it by
   force if necessary.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.095
  Angela, yeah, I have to go.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.065
My life is being
threatened by a bully.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.602
 <i>Arrivederci.</i>

08:55.635 --> 08:58.138
  Hey, look, Screech, what's so
  important about
  this phone call?

08:58.171 --> 09:01.508
   I'm expecting a call.
   It's from a girl.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.010
 You've got a woman
 calling you?

09:04.010 --> 09:06.146
  On purpose?

09:07.580 --> 09:10.016
  Yeah, I get around.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.719
 Ah, who am I kidding?
 I'm scared to death.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.622
   - I don't know what to do.
   - Well, be yourself.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.158
I can't,
I want to impress her.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.126
   Don't try to impress
   anybody.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.228
   Be proud of what you are,

09:22.262 --> 09:24.831
   whatever that is.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.033
  Look, she's probably
  more nervous than you are.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.168
 You really think so?

09:28.201 --> 09:31.538
 When that phone rings,
 be strong.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.141
Thanks, Slater.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.618
( phone rings )

09:45.919 --> 09:47.620
Hello?

09:47.654 --> 09:49.356
   This is Screech.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.858
Is this Zack's friend?

09:51.891 --> 09:54.728
What's that?
You've seen me around?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.597
 And you like me?
 Please hold.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.239
   What's your name?

10:06.272 --> 10:08.775
   ( high voice )
   My name is, uh...

10:08.808 --> 10:10.043
Bambi.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.845
  Look, I know this
  is kind of sudden,

10:11.878 --> 10:14.381
  but I have to tell
  you the way I feel.

10:19.085 --> 10:22.956
 You know, I've been
 watching you for a long time.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.292
  You're really cute.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.660
Belding:
That may be so,

10:27.694 --> 10:31.798
but this is neither the
time nor the place to
share those feelings.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.167
Young lady, the men's room
is one of the few doors

10:34.200 --> 10:36.870
   education should
   not open for you.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.205
   Now don't misunderstand,

10:39.239 --> 10:43.343
I am flattered that you
think so highly of me.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.211
  But Bambi,

10:45.245 --> 10:48.014
 it's not really
 love you feel for me,

10:49.249 --> 10:50.950
  it's hero worship.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.020
  Rock stars, ball players,
  principals...

10:54.054 --> 10:56.156
heck, we excite people.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.093
Bambi?

11:01.127 --> 11:03.163
 Are you there, Bambi?

11:03.196 --> 11:06.833
 Hey, I think she ran back
 into the forest with Thumper.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.770
 Belding:
 Who is that?

11:10.804 --> 11:13.073
 Hey, it's Slater,
 Mr. Belding.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.075
  ( toilet flushing )

11:18.178 --> 11:20.080
   What have you
   done with Bambi?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.282
 - Who's Bambi?
 - Well, she's a girl,

11:22.315 --> 11:24.184
   and she was just
   in here with me.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.885
  Oh, really?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.090
   Well, not actually
   in here with me.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.459
 ( laughing )

11:32.492 --> 11:34.828
 There's a really good
 explanation for this

11:34.861 --> 11:36.996
   and I wish
   I could find it.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.466
Hey...

11:39.499 --> 11:41.167
 it's all right, Mr. Belding.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.903
   Why don't we just keep this
   between the three of us?

11:43.937 --> 11:46.740
  Good idea.
  Thank you.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.342
 Just thank me
 at report card time.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.014
I am never going
to the bathroom again.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.321
 Good morning, world.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.190
  Hey, Zack. I talked
  to Bambi again last night.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.093
 I know.
 I mean, how'd it go?

12:07.127 --> 12:10.063
  She makes me feel
  like a young buck.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.799
  Who's Bambi?

12:12.832 --> 12:14.801
   She's a girl
   Zack found for me.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.204
  You found a girl for Screech?
  I'm so relieved.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.774
 I mean, I'm so happy.

12:20.807 --> 12:21.975
   Hi, guys.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.778
  I'm taken, Lisa.
  Eat your heart out.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.448
Wow, you must
really like this Bambi.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.351
   Oh, Jessie, you've
   got to meet her.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.087
 Wait a minute.
 I've got to meet her.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.089
   - You haven't met her yet?
   - You don't understand.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.957
- He can't meet her.
- Why can't he meet her?

12:37.991 --> 12:39.359
Yeah,
why can't he meet her?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.394
 Well, because, uh...

12:41.428 --> 12:44.097
   because...
   she's not what you think.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.101
  She's having
  an identity crisis.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.837
  Oh.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.809
   Way to go, Zack.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.581
   Anyone who thinks
   what I did to
   Screech was mean,

13:01.614 --> 13:04.784
   raise your hand.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.754
 Ah, come on. He'll be over
 Bambi in a few hours.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.057
Hey everybody, come quick.
You've got to see this.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.065
  Screech,
  what are you doing?

13:19.065 --> 13:21.334
  Demonstrating
  my love for Bambi.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.536
 Come on, Screech.
 Stop fooling around.

13:23.570 --> 13:27.140
   - I'm not fooling around.
   - Oh, my gosh.

13:27.173 --> 13:29.809
  I can't eat, I can't sleep,

13:29.843 --> 13:33.146
 I can't do science projects.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.449
   I'm not leaving this locker
   till I meet Bambi, Zack.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.326
I couldn't help it, Mr.
Belding.
I'm in love.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.728
 Screech, I'm fully aware
 that people your age

13:48.762 --> 13:50.864
 form rather intense
 attachments.

13:50.897 --> 13:53.933
But they usually wear
a locket, not a locker.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.274
  Jenny, have we heard
  anything from maintenance?

14:01.307 --> 14:02.676
  Jenny: <i>No.</i>

14:02.709 --> 14:04.044
Please call them again

14:04.044 --> 14:06.613
and tell them I'm
still waiting for them.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.281
  Jenny: <i>Who is this?</i>

14:08.314 --> 14:10.250
  Thank you.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.186
   Listen, Screech,

14:13.219 --> 14:16.122
   I sympathize with you,
   but there's really
   nothing I can do.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.324
 There's something
 Zack can do.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.260
   He knows
   Bambi personally.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.729
   Bambi? Is this the Bambi?

14:22.762 --> 14:23.897
  Is that who
  we're talking about?

14:23.930 --> 14:25.398
 You know her?

14:25.432 --> 14:28.668
  Well, I've sat and talked
  with her recently.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.639
   Leave this to me.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.078
  Zack Morris,
  I need you.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.693
 - You called?
 - Yes, I did.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.429
  Unfortunately, only you
  can help this boy.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.899
   Please have Bambi at The Max
   at 4:00 to meet with him.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.801
   That's beyond impossible.

15:01.835 --> 15:05.038
  Zack, let's talk
  man to man,

15:05.705 --> 15:07.707
<i>"mano y mano."</i>

15:07.741 --> 15:11.077
 Now, officially I cannot
 order you to do this,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.346
   but if Bambi's
   not there, well,

15:13.380 --> 15:17.117
 this could be your
 most miserable semester yet.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.820
  - Screech: Uh, Mr. Belding?
  - Mm-hmm.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.289
   I have to go
   to the bathroom.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.463
 Jenny, get maintenance
 up here right now. Code blue!

15:30.497 --> 15:32.432
  Jenny: <i>Who is this?</i>

15:36.302 --> 15:38.338
 - ( knocking )
 - Come in.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.141
 I got here as fast as I could.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.076
  Thanks Lisa,
  I won't forget this.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.878
Neither will l.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.413
What's she doing here?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.848
 I had to go pick
 up my color wheel at Jessie's.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.084
   And Jessie said, "Why?"
   I said, "Zack needs it."

15:51.117 --> 15:54.854
  Jessie said, "Why?"
  So I told her about Screech
  and Jessie said...

15:54.888 --> 15:58.091
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.526
Great. Let's just
get on with it.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.761
Yeah, we don't
have much time.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.164
 Here, Bambi.

16:04.197 --> 16:07.867
  Oh, ha ha. You think
  this is fun for me?

16:07.901 --> 16:10.036
  You think I want to dress
  up like a girl?

16:10.036 --> 16:13.306
   Well, this is repulsive,
   disgusting, revolting...

16:14.841 --> 16:18.244
 can I see
 something in a blue?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.848
   Yeah, you're right.
   This might be a little
   forward for a first date.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.084
 This is a first date, right?

16:25.885 --> 16:28.855
 Well, I better get started
 on his nails.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.857
Oh, now wait a second.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.926
  Here, make yourself useful.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.297
I don't need to shave.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.531
  Your legs.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.138
 Excuse me sir, but a Mr.
 Screech has
 reserved that table.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.073
- It's me, Max.
- Screech!

16:47.073 --> 16:50.076
You look great.
I didn't recognize you.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.878
  I'm meeting a girl in here.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.179
   Are those for your date?

16:53.213 --> 16:58.084
They're almost dead,
but that's all they had
left at the market.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.020
 Well, she might like
 these better.

17:00.053 --> 17:03.823
  Thanks, Max, but isn't there
  a little something missing?

17:03.857 --> 17:06.226
 Well, they're late bloomers.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.797
Thanks.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.403
   I am getting
   front row seats for this.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.371
I prefer the balcony.
Enjoy the show.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.440
   You too.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.349
   I want you to know
   that I'm taking the names

17:29.382 --> 17:31.818
of everyone
who's laughing.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.355
 Hi there.
 Who are you?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.924
  Your worst nightmare, pal.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.207
   - Screech?
   - Bambi?

17:54.240 --> 17:57.510
   Oh boy!
   I mean, sit down.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.280
   My, it's a lot brighter
   in here than l
   thought it'd be.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.282
   Good,
   then everyone'll see you.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.818
   Dream come true.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.286
 Gosh, you're pretty.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.022
And you have the most
feminine little hands.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.557
   - Do not.
   - Do too.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.592
   - Do not!
   - Do too.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.095
  Would you like to meet
  some of my friends?

18:15.128 --> 18:17.330
 - No. No.
 - Oh, come on.

18:17.364 --> 18:21.267
Slater, meet my date.
This is Bambi.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.104
   Oh, so you're the famous
   Bambi, huh?

18:24.137 --> 18:26.106
 I've heard all about
 you from Mr. Belding.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.041
Oh, Richard and l
are just good friends.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.610
   Hey, there's Kelly.
   Come on.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.545
 Whoa.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.914
This little guy
has good taste.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.583
Fresh.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.553
Morris?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.189
  Nice legs.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.594
 Bambi, this is Kelly.

18:47.627 --> 18:51.197
Nice to meet you.
Don't I know you
 from somewhere?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.133
   I don't know.
   Were you ever a Brownie?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.268
Yes, I was.
What troop were you in?

18:55.301 --> 18:58.138
 Um... F-Troop.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.908
   Nice one.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.010
  Slater, please,
  I beg you.

19:04.044 --> 19:07.414
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with
me, sweetheart.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.455
 Hey, Screech,

19:15.488 --> 19:18.625
 Lisa's just doing that
 to make you jealous.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.528
 Now, if you
 kissed Bambi,

19:21.561 --> 19:23.897
   hey, that would
   show her.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.499
  Um... um...

19:26.533 --> 19:28.401
 all right,
 but on one condition.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.170
 If we kiss, we become an item.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.172
 I can live with that.

19:33.573 --> 19:37.377
  Hey Kelly, why don't we leave
  these two lovebirds alone?

19:39.245 --> 19:43.149
 Hey, if it doesn't work out
 with you and Screech, call me.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.354
Now Screech,
if we're going to date,

19:47.387 --> 19:49.422
 you've got to follow my rules.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.591
  Rules?
  What rules?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.593
  My rules of livin'
  and lovin'.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.596
   You must follow
   them explicitly.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.099
   - What are they?
   - Rule number one:

19:59.132 --> 20:01.301
   Straighten your hair
   and dye it blond.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.371
  Consider me
  Billy Idol.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.574
   Well then, uh,
   rule number two:

20:07.607 --> 20:10.577
   I'm allergic to all
   types of animals.

20:10.610 --> 20:14.681
  Done. I'll shave my birds.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.651
  All right.
  Here's number three,
  the most important:

20:18.685 --> 20:22.689
  I'm very possessive,
  and I must have
  you all to myself.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.325
  Get rid of your
  friend Zack Morris.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.093
  - That's all?
  - ( low voice ) That's all?

20:27.127 --> 20:29.262
 I mean, what?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.133
 Well, Zack is awfully cocky.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.735
   He's always taking
   advantage of me,

20:35.769 --> 20:39.472
   and sometimes I think he
   underestimates
   my intelligence.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.443
  But he is my friend

20:43.476 --> 20:45.578
 and I'm sorry,
 but I won't trade him

20:45.612 --> 20:48.181
 for anything
 else in the world.
 Not even you, Bambi.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.551
  You mean,
  you're dumping me?

20:52.686 --> 20:54.354
   I hope I haven't
   hurt you.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.723
  I hope I haven't hurt you.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.360
 No, actually you've helped me.
 You've made me realize

21:00.393 --> 21:02.395
there are a million
fish in the sea

21:02.429 --> 21:05.632
   and I'm just the worm
   to attract them.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.801
   Now if you'll excuse me,

21:07.834 --> 21:10.470
 I have a science project
 that needs finishing.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.506
  Well, you better hurry it
  if it's due Friday.

21:18.211 --> 21:21.281
  You know, I watched what you
  did here today for Screech,

21:21.314 --> 21:24.551
it was really nice.
Sick, but nice.

21:24.584 --> 21:28.321
   Come on, you know I did it
   because l wanted him to
   finish the project.

21:28.355 --> 21:31.791
 Well, maybe.
 But you also did it
 'cause you're his friend too.

21:31.825 --> 21:34.160
  You know, actually
  I had a good time.

21:34.194 --> 21:36.429
   It was better than
   most first dates.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.431
  I'm going to the girls' room.
  You want to come?

21:38.465 --> 21:40.500
   Oh, why not?
   Sounds like fun.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.402
Freeze!

21:47.707 --> 21:49.743
 ( instrumental music plays )
