WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:05.671
What a jerk.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.674
What is he doing
on the phone?

00:10.711 --> 00:13.379
Oh, that is
so wrong.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.314
Girl, he better spend some...

00:15.649 --> 00:17.216
(Screams)

00:17.218 --> 00:19.151
Oh, my god!
Hang on.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.387
(Car engine sputtering)
I have the worst luck!

00:24.558 --> 00:26.558
(Engine struggles to start)

00:26.560 --> 00:29.395
I am so, so
sorry, sir.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.163
I have no idea
how this happened,

00:31.165 --> 00:32.431
but I have insurance,
don't worry.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.665
Well, at least
i had insurance.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.800
I'm a little late
on my last payment.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.468
Hey!

00:37.571 --> 00:39.071
Unbelievable!

00:39.073 --> 00:41.073
What is wrong with people today?

00:41.075 --> 00:43.142
(Thumping, gurgling)

00:55.756 --> 00:56.655
(Screams)

01:27.254 --> 01:29.321
(Indistinct chatter)

01:31.625 --> 01:32.758
What do you think?

01:32.760 --> 01:36.261
I think that Gibbs
cannot be bribed.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.663
I'm not trying to bribe Gibbs.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.300
I'm just...

01:41.302 --> 01:43.769
Politely asking for his help.

01:44.805 --> 01:45.804
Help with what?

01:45.806 --> 01:48.507
Oh, Gibbs' makeover
inspired me.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.642
I'm ready for a change, too.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.111
Hey, don't fix
what isn't broken.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.146
Oh, no, I don't mean me.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.298
It's my lab.

01:56.299 --> 01:58.449
I mean, I have enjoyed
a decade-plus

01:58.452 --> 01:59.685
of being below sea level,

01:59.687 --> 02:02.321
but I just imagine this view

02:02.323 --> 02:06.391
that doesn't include
people's bunions.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.827
She wants to swap offices
with accounting.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.262
Abby:
I put in a request.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.530
But accounting got wind of it,

02:11.532 --> 02:12.798
they staged this huge protest,

02:12.800 --> 02:14.666
and human resources denied.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.801
And you think
Gibbs will help.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.369
Because there's
nothing he likes more

02:17.371 --> 02:19.404
than h.R. Drama.
No, I know.

02:19.406 --> 02:23.142
That's why he just needs to be
properly motivated.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.277
I can think of a few other
adjectives that, uh,

02:25.279 --> 02:26.545
might describe our boss better.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.412
Grumpiest.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.413
Angriest.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.214
Loneliest.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.249
Grouchiest.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.683
Gibbs:
Quietest.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.689
But also fairest.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.424
Strongest.
Coolest.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.461
Hey, Gibbs!

02:42.463 --> 02:44.329
My savior.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.664
H.R. Already said no.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.366
I know. I know.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.434
That's why I just need you
to talk to the accountants.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.903
I know how you feel
about accountants,

02:50.905 --> 02:53.572
but they're not, like,
contagious or anything.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.340
I just need you to convince them

02:55.342 --> 02:58.610
that a-a musty
subterranean cavern

02:58.612 --> 03:01.380
is a fabulous place
for a new office.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.482
Thanks.
Saved by the bell, boss.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.851
Unfortunately, this time,
the bell is a dead Navy captain

03:05.853 --> 03:07.419
in park view.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.421
Grab your gear.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.497
Victim is Navy reserve captain
Jeremy doblin.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.365
It's his car.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.367
Who was driving it?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.002
No prints.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.636
Driver was probably
wearing gloves.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.506
And not much of a physical
description from the witness.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.309
"It was, like, a guy.
I think."

03:30.311 --> 03:31.710
That's all she
could give us.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.945
She pretty rattled?
McGee:
Oh, yeah,

03:32.947 --> 03:34.680
but, uh, not about the accident.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.716
Metro ticketed her
for, uh, driving and texting

03:37.718 --> 03:39.718
and we took the cell phone
into evidence.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.453
She almost
had a stroke.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.223
Ducky:
It's called nomophobia.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.426
As in "no mobile phone" phobia.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.560
It's quite common.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.729
And a sad reflection on our

03:50.731 --> 03:52.798
inability to disconnect,

03:52.800 --> 03:54.833
to use the parlance.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.736
In fact...
(Phone ringing)

03:59.373 --> 04:00.806
Sorry.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.507
Thought that
was on vibrate.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.443
Oh, um...
Actually,

04:04.445 --> 04:05.777
it's Jake
calling again.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.512
He's already called
three times.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.580
Uh...

04:11.719 --> 04:13.685
Hey, Jake...
(Phone ringing)

04:13.687 --> 04:16.455
Don't even think
about it.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.990
Hmm-mm.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.292
You have to leave again?

04:20.294 --> 04:22.261
You just got back.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.996
Is it out of the country?

04:25.466 --> 04:27.733
Oh. Right.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.435
No, I get it.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.037
Well...

04:32.039 --> 04:34.339
I know just what
I'm going to wear

04:34.341 --> 04:35.607
when you get home.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.909
(Chuckles)

04:37.911 --> 04:39.444
Wherever you're going.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.882
You don't know
where he's going?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.786
Uh, that was
a private phone call.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.689
Oh? Okay, sorry.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.758
(Sighs)

04:54.295 --> 04:57.296
He can't tell me
where he's going.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.564
Which... I get.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.534
Kind of. Sort of.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.702
Maybe-- not really.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.306
I... it's actually fine.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.743
It's just...

05:11.745 --> 05:16.515
He's been traveling
a lot recently, and...

05:16.517 --> 05:18.583
It's been hard.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.090
Well, he's been stabbed,
but I would surmise

05:25.092 --> 05:27.025
that captain doblin's
cause of death

05:27.027 --> 05:29.594
was asphyxiation
from a crushed windpipe.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.496
Tony:
Killer could've been
dumping the victim's body

05:31.498 --> 05:32.631
when he got rear-ended.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.032
Doctor, there's some mass

05:34.034 --> 05:35.600
in his lower abdomen, here.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.568
Huh?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.406
Oh, yeah, sizable.

05:41.408 --> 05:44.376
But it's too large
for a kidney or gallstone

05:44.378 --> 05:46.678
and too regular for a fibroid.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.382
Well, I can't even speculate
as to what that might be.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.617
I can.

05:52.619 --> 05:53.785
It's my magnet,

05:53.787 --> 05:55.654
for hanging my keys
on the fridge.

05:55.656 --> 05:56.788
Best gift
i ever got.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.393
Ah!

06:01.395 --> 06:02.728
Tony:
Look at that!

06:02.730 --> 06:03.929
That's a new one.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.041
McGee:
Captain Jeremy doblin,
55 years old,

06:16.043 --> 06:18.076
worked as a biochemist
for the Navy.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.945
Gibbs:
Anything classified?

06:19.946 --> 06:21.813
Nope. Alternative carbon-neutral
energy production.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.949
It's actually really
interesting, what he was doing.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.684
Not really, mcnerd.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.420
What is interesting is
the fact that his C.O. says

06:28.422 --> 06:29.922
he's been divorced
three times,

06:29.923 --> 06:31.423
has no friends or family
that still talks to him.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.491
Yeah?

06:33.827 --> 06:36.027
Uh, he also got three
tickets for road rage

06:36.029 --> 06:37.696
and was reprimanded

06:37.698 --> 06:39.564
for a shady real estate
deal last year.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.699
McGee:
So, basically, everybody

06:40.701 --> 06:41.900
in the world wants
this guy dead.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.002
DiNozzo, take the wives.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.036
I didn't mean to draw any

06:45.038 --> 06:46.972
similarities...
Bishop.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.140
Road rage and real estate.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.674
McGee, evidence garage.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.176
Finish processing the car.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.989
Hello, people that work even
lower underground than I do.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.557
Hello, Abby.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.093
Yeah, to what do we owe
the pleasure?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.162
I found
an odd compound

07:10.164 --> 07:11.730
in captain doblin's blood

07:11.732 --> 07:13.632
and I was wondering
if maybe he had

07:13.634 --> 07:15.600
some kind of medical issue
that could explain it.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.737
No, the captain was in
perfect physical health.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.606
Though, i-i read his file,

07:21.608 --> 07:22.874
and he could be suffering

07:22.876 --> 07:25.143
from one or more
personality disorders.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.878
Jimmy:
This is not
an organic compound.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.014
It looks manufactured.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.917
Yeah. I couldn't find a match
in any of my databases.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.019
But I did trace one ingredient

07:34.021 --> 07:36.988
to a company called
celodyne pharmaceuticals.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.723
Would you like me
to call over there

07:38.725 --> 07:39.991
and ask about this compound?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.760
No, thank you.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.528
I have decided
to take a field trip

07:43.530 --> 07:45.030
to get out of my

07:45.032 --> 07:47.499
underground dungeon tomb
for a little while.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.784
Oh, hey, Gibbs.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.068
I didn't even see you
standing there.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.704
I need you to sign this
permission slip for me,

07:52.706 --> 07:54.239
for my field trip.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.543
Okay, okay, okay.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.111
I will talk to
the accountants.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.247
I knew I could count on you.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.052
Imagine what it would like to
actually be on her bad side.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.186
No, I would rather not,

08:08.188 --> 08:09.688
thank you very much.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.689
What do you got?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.057
Well, I can confirm

08:12.059 --> 08:14.526
that the captain did indeed die

08:14.528 --> 08:15.927
from a crushed
trachea.

08:15.929 --> 08:16.928
The killer used

08:16.930 --> 08:19.231
what is known in Shaolin kung fu

08:19.233 --> 08:20.699
as a "claw" grip.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.067
It would take some
serious strength

08:22.069 --> 08:23.969
for a layman to crush
another person's trachea

08:23.971 --> 08:26.105
using only
three fingers.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.240
So either you're looking for
someone extremely strong...

08:28.242 --> 08:30.075
Jimmy:
Or someone trained

08:30.077 --> 08:32.210
in dragon style!

08:32.212 --> 08:33.512
Hwah...!

08:33.514 --> 08:34.746
(Laughs)

08:37.251 --> 08:38.550
I won't do that again.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.685
What was inside him?

08:40.687 --> 08:41.720
Well, as Mr. Palmer

08:41.722 --> 08:43.655
demonstrated earlier,

08:43.657 --> 08:44.956
it was metallic.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.292
Um, a container of some kind,

08:47.294 --> 08:49.528
lodged in his sigmoid colon.

08:49.530 --> 08:50.562
It's a technique

08:50.564 --> 08:52.197
common amongst
smugglers.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.865
What was he smuggling?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.567
Well, time to find out.
Mr. Palmer?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.707
It's botulinum.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.142
What?

09:04.144 --> 09:07.879
That's one of the deadliest
neurotoxins on the planet.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.114
Where did he get this?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.316
I'd be more concerned
to find out

09:11.318 --> 09:13.285
what he was planning
to do with it.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.289
Woman:
Celodyne.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.774
Searching the world over

09:18.775 --> 09:20.258
to find cures
for a better tomorrow...

09:20.260 --> 09:21.293
Abby:
Hi.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.128
Good morning.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.829
I'm here to see Dr. brown.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.264
Mm-hmm.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.832
Janitor:
I like your parasol.

09:27.834 --> 09:28.967
Thanks.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.268
I like your... mop.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.570
Want to trade?

09:31.572 --> 09:32.955
No.

09:32.956 --> 09:34.339
All right.
Woman:
Absolutely not!

09:34.341 --> 09:36.141
You tell that s.O.B.
I can import a generic

09:36.143 --> 09:37.976
for one-tenth the price
he's offering me!

09:37.978 --> 09:39.244
Love the parasol.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.345
No deal, and when
i get back...

09:40.347 --> 09:41.346
Woman 2:
Ms. Sciuto?

09:41.348 --> 09:42.781
Hi. Oh!

09:42.783 --> 09:44.349
Nice parasol.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.734
Dr. Janice brown.

09:45.735 --> 09:47.118
You came to talk
with me about a compound?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.053
Yes, right.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.621
This is for you.
This way.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.623
Celodyne.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.224
Searching the world over
to find cures for a better...

09:53.226 --> 09:55.126
(Classical music playing)
This is good timing, actually,

09:55.128 --> 09:58.096
because most of the company
are away on some retreat

09:58.098 --> 10:00.599
and, uh,

10:00.601 --> 10:02.133
I could use
the company.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.302
I'm sorry, I can barely hear you
'cause the music's blaring.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.303
Oh. Sorry.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.873
Wait, I'll turn it down.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.109
(Music fades)

10:11.111 --> 10:13.244
No, I was just saying
i could use the company,

10:13.246 --> 10:14.646
because, you know,

10:14.648 --> 10:16.314
it's sometimes a bit lonely
in the basement.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.816
Tell me about it.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.818
I used to really like solitude.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.086
And now you're
ready for a change.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.087
Eh...

10:22.089 --> 10:23.539
Oh, my god, hug-a-seal!

10:23.540 --> 10:24.990
That's one of my
favorite charities!

10:24.992 --> 10:26.725
I'm a local ambassador.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.544
(Chuckles)

10:28.545 --> 10:30.362
Yeah, i-i also do work
for, um, friends for fish

10:30.364 --> 10:32.631
and eco warriors.
No way, so do I.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.332
Oh! And what about
operation sunlight?

10:34.334 --> 10:35.667
"Because sunlight is the..."

10:35.669 --> 10:37.402
Both:
"...Best disinfectant."

10:37.404 --> 10:40.105
I feel like
we should toast.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.406
Caf-pow!

10:46.647 --> 10:49.314
Do you want
to show me your compound?

10:52.853 --> 10:56.655
Still no suspects for
captain doblin's murder,

10:56.657 --> 10:58.223
but I spoke
to his C.O.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.958
He confirmed there's
botulinum toxin

10:59.960 --> 11:01.393
stored in doblin's office.

11:01.395 --> 11:02.694
Anything missing?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.162
Yeah, but apparently,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.830
it's not an easy thing
to smuggle out.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.832
Doblin didn't do it
the easy way.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.101
But, Gibbs, there's
more toxin missing

11:10.103 --> 11:11.369
than ducky found.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.404
A lot more.

11:12.406 --> 11:13.938
McGee:
I didn't find any more toxin.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.841
But I did find these
hidden all around the car.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.410
Hmm, guess we can add
"drinking problem"

11:18.412 --> 11:21.112
to our victim's
stellar résumé.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.848
(Faint music playing)

11:23.850 --> 11:25.917
That's in the car.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.790
(Music gets louder)

11:33.994 --> 11:35.794
Unknown caller.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.997
Let's answer it.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.466
I'll start a trace.

11:42.869 --> 11:43.902
Yeah?

11:43.904 --> 11:44.969
Man:
Where you been?

11:44.971 --> 11:46.404
You ready?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.139
Uh-huh.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.241
Good. 31 elm street.
Two hours.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.843
Tell them Doug sent you.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.012
These are new buyers,
so don't be late.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.414
This group is very finicky.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.783
Bishop: Sounds like
some kind of meet?

11:58.785 --> 12:00.418
Maybe to sell the toxin.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.887
Could be what
got doblin killed.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.289
Well, only one way to find out.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.725
Bishop, intel on the address.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.060
McGee, get DiNozzo, gear up.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.129
We're gonna make this meet.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.771
Well, I know exactly what you
found in your victim's blood.

12:19.773 --> 12:23.775
It is a base molecule of
a generic antidepressant

12:23.777 --> 12:25.310
that our company imports.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.478
You sound surprised.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.879
Um, well, yes.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.080
'Cause the...
(Laughs)

12:29.082 --> 12:30.815
...the active ingredient
is missing,

12:30.817 --> 12:32.383
which is literally impossible,

12:32.385 --> 12:35.120
because the two are bonded
together during production.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.922
So...

12:37.924 --> 12:39.824
How did my victim end up

12:39.826 --> 12:42.794
with half your drug
in his blood?

12:42.796 --> 12:45.063
Um...

12:45.065 --> 12:47.799
I-i just, I have no idea.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.168
It's strictly tested, so...

12:50.170 --> 12:51.803
I don't...

12:51.805 --> 12:53.004
Would it hurt him?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.339
It wouldn't have done anything.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.107
It's...
(Laughs)

12:56.109 --> 12:58.076
If you're depressed and you need

12:58.078 --> 12:59.878
an antidepressant,
then...

12:59.880 --> 13:01.412
(Quietly):
You know...

13:01.414 --> 13:04.382
That could lead to some
behavioral complications.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.884
(Alarm wailing)
Hey!

13:05.886 --> 13:07.218
What is that?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.987
That's the level four
containment alarm.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.055
That means, um,
the ebola lab

13:11.057 --> 13:12.423
has had a leak.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.159
There's a lockdown procedure,
right?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.494
The, well, the whole ebola wing
goes on lockdown.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.063
Yeah, doors and ventilation
and everything.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.832
So...
(Stammers)

13:20.834 --> 13:24.002
And the-- and then
the lab perimeter seals.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.403
Okay, so we're safe over here?

13:25.405 --> 13:26.371
Mm-hmm, yep, safe.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.438
Totally safe.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.073
Yep.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.375
Are you a...

13:30.377 --> 13:32.343
Bit of a germophobe?
Mm-hmm.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.979
All right, well, everything's
going to be fine.

13:34.981 --> 13:35.980
(Gunfire)

13:35.982 --> 13:38.216
(Gasps)

13:38.218 --> 13:39.284
What was that?

13:39.286 --> 13:40.819
That sounded like gunshots.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.087
Man (Over P.A.):
Switching to automation

13:43.089 --> 13:45.256
and beginning
lockdown procedures.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.424
All personnel proceed
to lockdown destination.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.894
(Alarm wailing)

13:49.896 --> 13:51.963
I don't think
everything's gonna be fine.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.909
(Steady beeping)

14:04.911 --> 14:07.445
Do you hear anything?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.447
I think they're gone.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.516
For now.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.586
I have to call NCIS.

14:14.588 --> 14:17.522
Oh, well, you can't
use that down here.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.226
There's no service
in the basement.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.929
Okay.

14:24.931 --> 14:28.132
The phone.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.201
Nope.

14:32.873 --> 14:33.938
No.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.940
That's down as well.
What do we do?

14:35.941 --> 14:37.941
Is this part of your ebola
containment protocol?

14:37.944 --> 14:39.644
No, neither are guns.
What's going on?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.212
I don't know, but we have
to find out-- may I?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.614
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.582
Computer's not my strong suit.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.252
Okay.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.487
I can use a "tcpdump"

14:49.489 --> 14:51.890
to sniff out the
security-related packets.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.660
Okay, well, here's good news.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.629
The ebola leak
was a false alarm.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.564
It was triggered from
outside the ebola lab.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.099
Who fakes an ebola leak?

15:01.101 --> 15:03.034
I don't know.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.968
Maybe the maniac handing out
bullet holes in the hallway.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.172
We need eyes.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.374
I'm gonna access the internal
surveillance cameras.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.942
You can do that?

15:10.944 --> 15:14.045
It's the janitor
with the parasol fetish.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.347
Janice:
Why is the guard
attacking the janitor?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.249
Why is the janitor
attacking the guard?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.951
Oh, I don't think
the janitor's a janitor.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.520
Man, I picked a bad day
for a field trip.

15:22.522 --> 15:26.224
Bishop:
<i> The house is owned</i>
<i> by a Latvian tycoon</i>

15:26.226 --> 15:28.226
named ivo skalbe;
Tendrils in

15:28.228 --> 15:30.028
too many shady
deals to mention.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.997
Skalbe spends most of his time
on his yacht in the Caymans.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.499
Supposedly he's there now.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.268
All right, well,
there's definitely

15:37.270 --> 15:39.187
someone in the house.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.105
I saw people moving in the
back room, a lot of people.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.473
One of us should
go with you, boss.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.242
We know that they're
expecting doblin right now.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.410
We don't know anything else.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.211
All right, here's this, boss.
Okay.

15:47.213 --> 15:51.382
Now, these vials are identical
to the one doblin used,

15:51.384 --> 15:53.685
except they have
GPS trackers inside.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.120
Here's a panic button
disguised as a car alarm.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.555
Bishop:
If you get into trouble,
push it,

15:57.557 --> 15:58.690
and we will come running.

15:58.692 --> 15:59.691
Look, bishop...

15:59.693 --> 16:01.559
(Tony grunting)

16:01.561 --> 16:02.961
I've done this before.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.062
Sorry.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.631
(Door closes)

16:06.633 --> 16:08.433
We're gonna need a bigger Van.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.501
(Doorbell ringing)

16:18.712 --> 16:20.078
Doug sent me.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.056
Good luck.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.358
You're going to need it.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.195
(Gasps)
Girls!

16:37.197 --> 16:40.131
Dr. Botox, he's here.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.333
(Women clamoring)

16:44.604 --> 16:46.170
Oh, he's so cute.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.107
(Car alarm chirping)

16:49.109 --> 16:51.476
Okay, we need to get
the Internet back online

16:51.478 --> 16:53.411
and call for help.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.746
I'm trying.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.481
But you can't hack something
that isn't connected,

16:56.483 --> 16:57.749
and we are not connected.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.718
Well, then we're stuck.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.686
Because the ebola lockdown
sealed all of our perimeters,

17:01.688 --> 17:03.554
so we need a blowtorch
to get out.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.689
Well, we can't just sit here.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.625
I'm okay with standing.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.360
Me, too.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.562
Uh...

17:11.564 --> 17:14.098
Wait.
What?

17:14.100 --> 17:16.367
Where does the Internet
come into the building?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.169
The, uh, the main server room.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.171
How far is that?
Uh...

17:23.643 --> 17:26.310
Okay, not far as
the crow flies,

17:26.312 --> 17:27.445
but the crows have guns.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.679
Good point.
Yes.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.548
So, that leaves us with...
Hide.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.582
And hope for the best.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.900
Or...
No.

17:32.901 --> 17:34.217
We try to make it
to the main server room.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.788
If I can get
the Internet back on,

17:36.790 --> 17:39.323
then I contact Gibbs.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.258
Who's Gibbs?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.261
Gibbs is the answer.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.663
Gibbs is always
the answer.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.765
I vote Gibbs.
I vote hide and
hope for the best.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.402
I hear you, but I have processed
way too many crime scenes

17:51.404 --> 17:55.373
with way too many dead people
who went with "hide and hope."

17:55.375 --> 17:56.674
(Sighs)
All right.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.276
Well, it doesn't
need both of us to go,

17:58.278 --> 17:59.644
so I know the building
better-- I should go.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.112
No.
I...

18:01.114 --> 18:02.680
Computers are not
your strong point.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.183
I have to go.
All right.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.484
Just be careful.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.753
That's my plan.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.622
(Groans)
How much longer
is this going to take?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.558
Well, it depends
on how much longer

18:13.560 --> 18:15.159
you're gonna hold out on us.

18:15.161 --> 18:18.296
I have a microdermabrasion
in 45 minutes.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.698
You will not be happy
if I miss it.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.401
What? No, I have
not had an eyelift.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.636
I don't believe you.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.538
And I would sue
if I were you.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.475
Well, there's nobody to sue,
because I haven't had it.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.577
Wait, why would I sue?

18:32.579 --> 18:33.611
You tell me...

18:33.613 --> 18:36.781
Marty feldman.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.650
Has anyone ever told you
you have potential

18:39.652 --> 18:43.287
to be a very
good looking man?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.889
Um, thanks?

18:44.891 --> 18:46.824
A little genioplasty...

18:46.826 --> 18:48.593
Here...

18:48.595 --> 18:50.728
And here

18:50.730 --> 18:52.864
would put you right
over the edge.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.432
Would you please
let go of my chin, please?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.234
Oh.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.236
McGee:
Oh, uh,

18:58.238 --> 18:59.337
I got to go.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.471
Try not to change
your appearance,

19:00.473 --> 19:01.539
uh, while I'm gone.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.807
Thank you.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.843
Are they talking?
McGee:
Oh, yeah.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.345
Marty feldman!

19:07.347 --> 19:08.479
It's getting
them to shut up

19:08.481 --> 19:09.347
that's the problem.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.382
About the case!
Oh.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.384
Uh, yeah, yeah, we're
pretty sure that, uh, doblin

19:13.386 --> 19:16.254
is<i> not</i> a bio-terrorist.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.556
As far as we can tell, he
stole the botulinum toxin

19:18.558 --> 19:20.358
so that he could
make homemade

19:20.360 --> 19:21.592
Botox injections.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.362
Tony:
Marty feldman?!

19:24.364 --> 19:25.496
Who set up the party?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.498
Marty feldman...
Some kind of broker.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.467
I'm guessing it's the person
that called doblin's cell,

19:29.469 --> 19:30.801
but no one's talking.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.236
Anything else?

19:32.238 --> 19:33.404
Yeah, franken-face
over there

19:33.406 --> 19:34.906
said she got treatments
from doblin.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.808
Said he, uh, was doing it
'cause he needed some fast cash.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.344
He even hit her up for a loan
during an injection.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.279
Did he say for what?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.648
I think the injection was Botox.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.017
Oh, uh, the loan.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.385
Um, "said he needed five grand
to pay off some loan shark

19:48.388 --> 19:49.854
who was threatening
to break his neck."

19:49.856 --> 19:51.522
McGee: That could be the
guy that killed doblin.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.524
I got a name--
Nicky Jones.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.493
Okay, finish here
and pick him up.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.928
It's nice work.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.397
Marty feldman?

19:59.399 --> 20:01.465
(Scoffs)

20:02.669 --> 20:04.735
Hi, Gibbs.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.022
Hey.

20:08.023 --> 20:09.673
So, while you guys
were doing the interviews,

20:09.676 --> 20:11.909
I finished running down
doblin's road rage victims.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.811
Yeah, and?

20:13.812 --> 20:15.712
They all had alibis for the time
of doblin's murder.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.782
But I did find
something else interesting.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.650
I ran the numbers
on doblin's cell.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.552
He's made
several calls to...

20:21.554 --> 20:24.555
Celodyne pharmaceuticals.

20:29.996 --> 20:33.698
¶ Hush, little Abby,
don't say a word ¶

20:33.700 --> 20:35.833
¶ the crazy gunmen won't ¶

20:35.835 --> 20:39.637
¶ shoot you in the face. ¶

20:40.740 --> 20:41.939
man: Hey.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.541
We're right on schedule.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.376
Everything's going
according to plan.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.778
We'll meet you in the server
room when you're done.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.285
All right, what's the word?

20:54.287 --> 20:55.920
Boss will be here in five.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.489
He's still securing a few
stragglers in the building.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.590
Man 2: How long's
it gonna take

20:59.592 --> 21:00.825
to retrieve the data
from the system?

21:00.827 --> 21:02.827
(Laughs)
Not long.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.997
Hard part was getting
in the room.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.498
Did you kill anyone?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.532
No, not yet.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.567
The day's young.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.569
(Indistinct chatter)

21:11.571 --> 21:14.005
Okay, Abby.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.906
What's the play?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.843
Same as before-- Gibbs.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.945
Which is impossible.

21:20.947 --> 21:24.715
Because the phone is out there
with the machine guns.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.419
And I'm trapped in here with...

21:28.421 --> 21:30.421
Tongs.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.541
Man 2:
So I said, "baby,

21:50.543 --> 21:52.076
you choose whatever
drapes you want."

21:52.078 --> 21:54.362
How does that make
me the bad guy?

21:54.363 --> 21:56.647
Man 1:
Maybe Gina just wants you
to have your own opinion.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.517
You sound just like her.
Ooh.
(Sniffing)

21:59.519 --> 22:02.420
You smell that?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.422
Oh, my god!

22:04.424 --> 22:07.024
God, I'm gonna be sick.
Bathroom down the hall!

22:07.026 --> 22:10.061
Out of my way. I'm gonna puke.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.510
(Line ringing)

22:26.512 --> 22:29.046
(Phone rings)
Hey, Abbs.
I was just calling you.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.948
(Congested):
I'm at celodyne pharmaceuticals,

22:30.950 --> 22:33.084
and the janitors
are robbing the place.
What?

22:33.086 --> 22:34.919
What? Say it again.
I can't understand you.

22:34.921 --> 22:38.489
I'm at the drug company, and the
janitors are robbing the place.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.424
Something in the computer.
The computer?

22:40.426 --> 22:42.026
Yeah, they're coming back.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.627
Okay, I'm gonna send you a file.
It's everything I know.

22:43.629 --> 22:46.430
You find a place to hide
and you stay put.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.865
We are coming to get you.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.735
(Trilling)

22:53.940 --> 22:56.874
Janitor:
Hey, all taken care of.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.109
I'm at the server room
now.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.009
(Walkie static)

23:09.455 --> 23:10.588
I'm here.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.123
Where the
hell are you?

23:12.125 --> 23:14.125
And what is that smell?

23:14.127 --> 23:16.594
Man 1:
No clue. Made us sick.
Hurry up and get back here.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.596
There's been a change of plans.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.498
There's an Abby Sciuto
in the building.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.067
She's from NCIS.
She's a fed.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.002
After we get done here,
we need to find her.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.971
We need to take her out.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.915
My statement is this:
Our building is locked down,

23:37.917 --> 23:39.917
the ebola leak
is fully contained.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.553
There is zero chance
of exposure in the wild.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.455
That's because there is no leak.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.756
This is a robbery.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.957
The leak is
a diversion.

23:46.959 --> 23:48.826
Special agent Gibbs, NCIS.
(Groans)

23:48.828 --> 23:50.561
Just what we need.
Another uninformed scaremonger

23:50.563 --> 23:52.797
going haywire because the word
"ebola" was mentioned.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.031
We've got somebody inside.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.433
Yeah, I've got people
inside, too.

23:55.435 --> 23:56.534
If we were being robbed,
I'd know about it.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.701
Get a frequency yet?

23:57.703 --> 23:59.837
Janitor:
Hey, guys, don't worry.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.006
Yeah. 27.05.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.041
Tony:
27.05.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.576
Okay, here we go.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.111
This is special agent
Anthony DiNozzo,

24:07.113 --> 24:09.146
NCIS, calling Travis cook.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.881
Who?
Janitor you hired last month.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.516
We pulled your records.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.018
Whatever you're up to,
it's over.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.786
We know you faked
the ebola leak.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.521
I don't know what hole you three
climbed out of, but...

24:17.523 --> 24:18.923
Cook:
Yeah? Well, I have hostages.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.925
Chopper on the roof, 90 minutes,

24:20.927 --> 24:22.960
or I kill them all.
Oh, my god.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.128
(Phone rings)
All right,

24:24.130 --> 24:25.863
relax, Travis.
Let's talk.
Yeah.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.466
You talk. I'm setting my watch.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.800
(Walkie static)

24:29.802 --> 24:32.136
(Sighs)
Who is he?

24:32.138 --> 24:34.705
We don't know yet.
He's got a stolen I.D.
What's he want?

24:34.707 --> 24:35.773
Who is he working for?

24:35.775 --> 24:36.874
No idea. And with no intel,

24:36.876 --> 24:38.426
we have no leverage.

24:38.427 --> 24:39.977
Bishop:
I may have some intel.
That was McGee.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.545
Botox party paid off.
He picked up

24:41.547 --> 24:43.681
Nicky Jones
for captain doblin's murder.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.916
Doblin called celodyne
the day he was killed.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.219
Maybe we talk to the killer,
find something. I can take it.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.588
No. Keep trying to reach cook.
Keep trying to reach Abby.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.089
Bishop, you're with me.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.959
Back to MTAC. Coordinate
security around the exterior.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.061
(Siren wailing in distance)

24:57.063 --> 24:59.730
This is bad. The feds
are here, I think.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.832
I mean, who the
hell is NCIS again?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.134
(Whispering):
We're the stuff
of your nightmares.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.237
Man 1:
Yeah, we got
another problem.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.239
Somebody put an override
on the system. I'm locked out.

25:08.241 --> 25:10.875
You're the computer guy,
okay? Figure it out.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.210
Good luck, mortal.
Man 2: This was supposed
to be on the d.L., man.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.612
Feds weren't a
part of the plan.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.881
Relax. It wasn't part
of plan "a,"

25:16.883 --> 25:18.282
but it is part
of plan "b."

25:18.284 --> 25:20.284
Man 1: Oh, there's a plan "b"?
Cook: Yeah, we stall.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.120
We get what we came here for,
then we use our alternate exit.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.122
Plan "b" also means

25:25.124 --> 25:28.058
we leave no witness behind.

25:29.562 --> 25:32.096
Okay. So let's assume

25:32.098 --> 25:34.031
that means a lot of dead people.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.033
Which means
i have to tell Gibbs.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.969
Somehow.

25:38.971 --> 25:42.006
Abby to Gibbs. Abby to Gibbs.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.741
Come in, Gibbs.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.944
They're going
to kill all the hostages.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.882
Okay, good effort,

25:51.884 --> 25:54.018
but let's assume
that did not work.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.554
There's got to be
something else.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.295
Oh, no.

26:04.297 --> 26:08.198
That's, like, the worst idea
in the history of ideas.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.201
You know him?

26:11.203 --> 26:13.203
Maybe. I know a lot of guys.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.838
Okay, here's
what I know.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.607
You threatened to kill him.
Now he's dead.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.609
All right, yeah, I know doblin.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.144
And, yeah, yeah,
i threatened to break his neck.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.745
Is that a crime?
McGee:
Yeah.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.558
Yeah, it is, actually.

26:23.559 --> 26:25.370
Well, you know what,
he had it coming.

26:25.371 --> 26:27.182
I lent him five grand
for this lame real estate deal.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.286
I was supposed to get ten back.
I got one.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.021
That when you threatened him?

26:31.022 --> 26:32.755
I was just lighting a fire
under his butt.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.725
And I did. Literally.

26:34.727 --> 26:35.993
He was so desperate
to pay me back

26:35.995 --> 26:37.661
that he was smuggling
all this stuff

26:37.663 --> 26:39.930
out of his office
up his...
We know about the Botox.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.899
It wasn't a serious threat. Duh.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.168
I mean, how am I gonna get my
money back if he's dead, right?

26:44.170 --> 26:46.070
(Chuckles)

26:46.072 --> 26:48.339
Look,

26:48.341 --> 26:50.941
I taped every single phone call
i had with this guy, all right?

26:50.943 --> 26:52.876
You're welcome to listen
to all of it.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.646
Whoever killed him,
it has nothing to do with me.

26:56.649 --> 26:59.183
But I do know

26:59.185 --> 27:01.218
about that drug company
doblin was calling.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.820
Let's hear it.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.054
I want a deal first.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.222
McGee:
For what?

27:05.224 --> 27:07.091
We haven't charged you
with anything.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.830
Oh, yeah. Oh, right. Okay. Well,

27:12.832 --> 27:14.832
I don't really know that much
anyway.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.967
Doblin was not making
a lot of sense,

27:16.969 --> 27:19.837
to be honest. I think the guy
was off his meds or something.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.372
Let's hear it.

27:21.374 --> 27:24.842
He mentioned millions of lives
being at stake.

27:24.844 --> 27:25.809
He say how?

27:29.081 --> 27:31.148
(Grunts)

27:38.658 --> 27:40.724
That was...

27:40.726 --> 27:42.393
Awesome?

27:42.395 --> 27:44.395
Surprisingly awesome.

27:44.397 --> 27:46.864
Janice:
Abby? Is that you?

27:46.866 --> 27:50.000
Yeah.
(Grunts)

27:50.002 --> 27:52.069
Oh.

27:53.172 --> 27:57.941
Wow, I heard these
crazy noises in the ceiling.

27:57.943 --> 28:01.111
Yeah, my-my stud cuff

28:01.113 --> 28:03.380
got caught on an air manifold.

28:03.382 --> 28:07.418
It got... ugly.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.421
Okay. Well,
at least you're safe.

28:10.423 --> 28:12.156
No. Not really.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.158
The bad guys saw my name
on the sign-in sheet,

28:14.160 --> 28:15.426
and now they're looking for me.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.895
Really? Did-did you connect
with your friend?

28:17.897 --> 28:19.363
I did, but I have
to call him again.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.731
Are you insane?

28:20.733 --> 28:22.199
You have to hide.
We have to hide.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.934
Listen to me,

28:23.936 --> 28:27.171
the bad guys have hostages,
and they're gonna kill them all.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.306
I'm sorry, what?
Are-are you sure?

28:29.308 --> 28:33.077
100%. We have to warn Gibbs.
How?

28:33.079 --> 28:35.129
We have no phone,
we have no Internet.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.180
We are cut off from all access
to the outside world.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.383
You sure about that?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.353
Where does that vent?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.792
(Trilling)

28:48.794 --> 28:50.928
(Door opens)
McGee:
Hey.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.930
Got here as quick as I could.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.099
Where's Gibbs?
Back at the drug company.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.333
What's going on?
Not sure.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.936
I was monitoring the
perimeter like Gibbs wanted.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.005
Two minutes ago, this vent
started blowing exhaust. A lot.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.007
That's right next to the lab
Abby's visiting.

29:04.009 --> 29:05.943
You think she could be
sending some kind of message?

29:05.945 --> 29:07.277
We need a better visual.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.912
Hey, Francis, you mind
if I jump in here, man?

29:08.914 --> 29:11.381
Yeah, sure. All yours.
Thanks.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.820
(Chuckles)

29:16.822 --> 29:19.223
I'm sorry about that.
It kind of sticks.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.991
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
why this is so short.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.292
You're only two inches taller
than I am.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.095
Well, you have a short torso.
What?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.530
What are you talking about? Have
you physically looked at me?

29:26.532 --> 29:27.998
Do I look
like I have a short torso?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.133
Guys.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.270
(Grunts)

29:33.272 --> 29:35.372
This is special agent
Timothy McGee.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.373
Who's on the
east wall?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.775
Agent rickley, sir.

29:37.777 --> 29:38.876
Turn your headlights on, please.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.477
Affirmative. Headlights on.
Hmm.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.946
You guys realize orange smoke
means

29:42.948 --> 29:45.149
"in distress,
requires assistance,"

29:45.151 --> 29:46.383
according
to naval maritime code.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.852
Which Abby knows.
She could be in trouble.

29:48.854 --> 29:49.920
If it is Abby.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.255
Why am I not more disturbed

29:51.257 --> 29:52.456
that caf-pow! Is only

29:52.458 --> 29:54.424
three ingredients away
from a smoke bomb?

29:54.426 --> 29:56.360
What if they don't get
the message?

29:57.329 --> 29:59.429
Then we all die.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.498
So I'm gonna remain positive.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.268
Gibbs is gonna see this,
and everything's gonna be fine.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.436
So we can hide
and wait for the cavalry now?

30:06.438 --> 30:09.006
Oh, I am totally ready
to just punch out

30:09.008 --> 30:10.908
and kick my feet up
in a vent somewhere.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.510
Cook (Over P.A.):
Attention, Ms. Sciuto,
wherever you are.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.846
We've recently come
to the conclusion

30:15.848 --> 30:19.349
it was you who locked out
the computer in the server room.

30:19.351 --> 30:23.520
You have exactly ten minutes
to unlock the system

30:23.522 --> 30:25.522
or we start killing hostages.

30:25.524 --> 30:29.026
If you help us,
i promise no one will be harmed.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.929
What-what is he talking about?

30:31.931 --> 30:34.565
Well, the bad guys are trying to
steal something off the server,

30:34.567 --> 30:36.166
so I locked them out of it.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.202
You locked... unlock it.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.037
No.
But they're
my coworkers.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.306
They're gonna kill the hostages
no matter what we do.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.907
Well, then we have to do
something.

30:43.909 --> 30:46.109
I know. I know.

30:46.111 --> 30:47.911
We only have one option.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.414
We go on the offensive.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.615
They are professional
killers.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.584
We're outnumbered.
They have guns.

30:53.586 --> 30:56.520
We have something
better than guns.

30:56.522 --> 30:59.857
We have our brains and your lab.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.637
Placing an awful lot of faith
in this Abby person's message.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.639
Yeah.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.640
This is special agent DiNozzo
calling for Travis cook.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.142
Still nothing, boss.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.144
(Sighs)
This could get ugly.
You better be right.

31:21.146 --> 31:23.947
Well, if Abby's calling for a
special request for assistance,

31:23.949 --> 31:25.515
it's already ugly.
Bishop.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.484
A team is standing by
at the rear entrance.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.086
But the security doors
are still locked tight.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.255
Excuse me. We're gonna
make a lot of noise

31:31.257 --> 31:32.356
if we have to break through.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.157
We'll lose
the element of surprise.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.926
Got to have the doors
open, McGee.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.928
Ceo:
The ebola quarantine
sealed the lab perimeter.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.129
For some reason,
my people can't get access

31:39.131 --> 31:40.330
to the system
to override it.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.633
It's Abby.
She locked out the system.

31:42.635 --> 31:45.135
I recognize this anywhere, boss.
This is the Sciuto special.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.371
She has her own personal
security hash.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.006
Bypass it.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.008
I can try, but it's Abby.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.944
Okay, glycerin's in.
What's next?

31:53.946 --> 31:57.247
Stir gently and
add six grams...

31:57.249 --> 31:59.049
Oh, magnesium, yeah, sorry.

31:59.051 --> 32:02.352
It's been antidepressants and
cholesterol down here for years.

32:02.354 --> 32:06.123
Haven't made a bomb
since... ever.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.525
I made two last week.
Wow.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.128
Um, wait, hang on. Six grams--
is that not too much?

32:11.130 --> 32:13.030
I mean, will it not
short-circuit the explosion?

32:13.032 --> 32:14.398
No, it should accelerate it.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.366
Okay. Trust you on that one.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.502
Oh, no!
I don't have magnesium.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.037
Oh...

32:30.049 --> 32:32.649
You can break up the flint.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.552
You have a fire-starter kit
in your heel?

32:35.554 --> 32:36.620
You don't?

32:36.622 --> 32:38.088
No.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.556
Okay, this is gonna do
a lot of damage.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.558
I know, I'm trying not
to think about it.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.261
It seemed like a way better
idea, like, five minutes ago.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.263
Well, they're gonna
kill hostages,

32:46.265 --> 32:47.531
so we don't have a choice.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.235
When I was young,
me and my brother, Luca,

32:52.237 --> 32:54.504
we saw this movie in school,

32:54.506 --> 32:57.240
and at the end, the good guy
killed the bad guy,

32:57.242 --> 32:59.242
and we all cheered.

32:59.244 --> 33:02.245
And Ms. Johnson turned off
the projector,

33:02.247 --> 33:05.248
and she said we don't
applaud killing,

33:05.250 --> 33:06.984
no matter who it is.

33:06.986 --> 33:10.253
If you take a life today,

33:10.255 --> 33:12.990
then you failed yesterday.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.524
I don't remember much
from fifth grade,

33:14.526 --> 33:16.093
but I remember that.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.596
Well, you weren't
here yesterday, so...

33:19.598 --> 33:22.332
No one's applauding.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.235
All right, it's time
to contact the bad guys.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.436
What are you gonna say?

33:27.673 --> 33:30.207
I'm telling them
that I'll do what they want.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.544
They just have
to come and get me.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.247
Open the doors, McGee.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.348
McGee: Trying to,
boss, just...

33:38.350 --> 33:40.417
Just please don't
shoot this computer.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.687
I've checked every lab
in this wing.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.422
Nobody's here.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.158
Well, this is where the NCIS
chick said that she would be.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.094
Whoa.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.230
That wasn't
here before.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.298
Well, then we know we're
going the right way.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.135
You coming?

33:58.137 --> 33:59.403
No.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.138
Oh, please, man,
it's an umbrella.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.205
It's not an ied.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.141
Go, go, move!

34:06.545 --> 34:08.545
(Chuckles)

34:08.547 --> 34:10.080
It was a dud.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.096
Told you that was
too much magnesium.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.568
All right, I'm in.

34:36.141 --> 34:38.108
Doors are open.
DiNozzo, bishop,
cover the back.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.177
McGee,
you're with me.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.681
Keep going.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.450
Just get in there.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.251
Just get in there.
Come on.
Janice: I'm going.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.356
Ms. Sciuto.

34:53.358 --> 34:54.825
Bad guy.

34:54.827 --> 34:56.560
Unlock the computer now.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.296
Release the hostages first--
that was the deal.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.630
Shut up
and stay out of this.

35:00.632 --> 35:01.798
No one is going anywhere.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.266
Then the deal's off.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.505
How about this deal?

35:08.507 --> 35:10.640
Unlock that computer right now,

35:10.642 --> 35:13.310
or I give the order
to kill hostages...

35:13.312 --> 35:14.544
Right now.

35:22.855 --> 35:23.820
Smart woman.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.158
Smarter than you.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.292
(Buzzing, clicking)

35:31.897 --> 35:33.163
What are you doing?

35:33.165 --> 35:34.431
Renegotiating.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.635
This is a canister of dx7 gas.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.370
If I release it
in this room,

35:40.372 --> 35:41.838
we'll all be dead
in ten seconds.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.573
What, that's not
a smoke bomb?

35:43.575 --> 35:44.808
Put down your weapons.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.578
(Chuckles)
You're bluffing.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.513
You're gonna kill the
hostages no matter what I do.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.915
"No witnesses,"
i heard you say it.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.384
If my life can
save theirs,

35:54.386 --> 35:56.920
I'm down 100%.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.656
Did I mention
you're bluffing?

35:59.658 --> 36:00.757
Because I'm not.

36:00.759 --> 36:01.858
Abby, don't do it!
Hey!

36:01.860 --> 36:04.361
Have you lost your mind?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.433
(All coughing)

36:13.472 --> 36:15.539
(Coughing):
Maple, open the door.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.285
(Pounding on door)

36:28.287 --> 36:29.819
Maple: Hey, what the hell's
going on in there?

36:29.821 --> 36:30.854
What's going on?!

36:30.856 --> 36:31.922
Gibbs:
NCIS! Freeze!

36:33.192 --> 36:36.693
Oh! Aah!

36:36.695 --> 36:38.695
Okay, everyone's
gonna be okay.

36:41.967 --> 36:42.883
Get up.

36:42.884 --> 36:43.800
Around the corner
and down the hall.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.442
Abby.

36:52.444 --> 36:53.977
Come on, Abbs.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.512
Wake up.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.480
Gibbs, what took you so long?

36:57.482 --> 36:59.216
Your firewall,
that's what.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.452
So why aren't we dead?

37:02.454 --> 37:06.856
'Cause there's no such
thing as a dx7 poison gas.

37:06.858 --> 37:10.493
I actually just made an
airborne incapacitating agent.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.895
Cook: I knew you
were bluffing.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.597
Ugh, I knew she was bluffing.

37:13.599 --> 37:14.898
Gibbs: Come on.
McGee: Let's go.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.909
Well, so much
for being in distress

37:25.911 --> 37:27.644
and requiring assistance.

37:27.646 --> 37:28.912
I was.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.380
And I did.

37:30.382 --> 37:33.450
I was... stalling
every which way I could

37:33.452 --> 37:34.985
until you got here.

37:34.987 --> 37:38.888
I made a knock-out gas,
i made a fake bomb.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.558
A fake... you-you knew
it wasn't going to explode?

37:41.560 --> 37:44.628
Gibbs, this is Janice.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.830
She's my new friend.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.466
She helped save the
lives of the hostages.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.600
And you can arrest her now,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.402
'cause she's working
with the bad guys.

37:54.606 --> 37:58.008
Although I did appreciate that
last-minute change of heart.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.820
What a day.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.355
I'm not a criminal.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.557
I-I'm a whistle-blower.

38:14.559 --> 38:16.293
With a résumé
to prove it.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.828
Arrested twice...

38:18.830 --> 38:21.531
For ramming whaling ships
in the sea of Japan.

38:21.533 --> 38:26.069
And once for chaining
herself to a logging truck

38:26.071 --> 38:27.671
in the Amazon jungle.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.005
That's our girl.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.074
She's like
"Abby unleashed."

38:31.076 --> 38:33.043
How'd you know
Janice was involved?

38:33.045 --> 38:36.780
Okay, I first suspected it when
i got into the server room,

38:36.782 --> 38:39.983
and I traced the fake ebola
alert back to her computer.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.452
But I was sure

38:42.454 --> 38:45.955
when the bad guy pronounced
my last name properly.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.924
I mean,
there's no way

38:47.926 --> 38:51.661
that he's gonna
read s-c-i-u-t-o

38:51.663 --> 38:52.996
off a sign-in sheet

38:52.998 --> 38:54.731
and get that right,

38:54.733 --> 38:56.733
so Janice must have
warned him about me.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.102
Janice: Cook wasn't
supposed to hurt Abby.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.837
Uh, wasn't supposed
to hurt anyone.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.740
I got scared when
she showed up,

39:03.742 --> 39:05.742
'cause i-i thought the
company was on to me,

39:05.744 --> 39:06.876
so I warned cook.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.346
He said we couldn't
wait any longer.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.447
For what?

39:10.449 --> 39:11.715
To get proof.

39:11.717 --> 39:15.452
Celodyne was
falsifying safety data

39:15.454 --> 39:18.655
to sell generic drugs
that did not work.

39:19.858 --> 39:23.593
Captain doblin is a
chemist, he figured it out.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.862
He contacted my research
lab about six weeks ago,

39:25.864 --> 39:29.132
and, uh, I mean, I didn't have
access into the server room,

39:29.134 --> 39:31.501
and I needed to get the proof.

39:31.503 --> 39:34.637
So you hired cook
to steal the data.

39:34.639 --> 39:37.140
Yeah, and take whatever else
he wanted as payment.

39:41.113 --> 39:44.381
And kill whoever
else he wanted.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.686
I didn't know.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.757
Doblin was, um...

39:53.759 --> 39:56.459
Uh, doblin was
getting cold feet...

39:56.461 --> 39:57.727
(Sniffles)
Before the j...

39:57.729 --> 39:59.763
Oh, god, cook must have
killed him.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.631
Like he was gonna
kill the hostages.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.633
That was not the plan.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.402
I mean, if-if we
hadn't, uh, been forced

40:05.404 --> 40:08.088
to speed everything up,

40:08.089 --> 40:10.773
people wouldn't even have known
that the theft had taken place.

40:10.776 --> 40:13.042
When I found out that cook
was gonna kill the hostages,

40:13.044 --> 40:15.412
I tried to stop him.

40:17.783 --> 40:21.451
I didn't want anybody
to get hurt.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.520
And least of all Abby.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.726
(Door opens)

40:32.030 --> 40:34.564
Falsifying safety data, huh?

40:34.566 --> 40:36.800
Those are serious charges.
Mm-hmm.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.068
I'll look into it
immediately, of course.

40:39.070 --> 40:42.639
Yeah, you should
do that. DiNozzo?

40:42.641 --> 40:45.074
I've got the fda commissioner
on speed dial,

40:45.076 --> 40:46.509
and I owe him a call.

40:46.511 --> 40:48.711
(Elevator bell dings)

40:51.116 --> 40:53.183
(Elevator bell dings)

40:53.185 --> 40:57.587
I heard the FBI arrested
the ceo of celodyne.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.923
And that ducky requested

40:59.925 --> 41:02.058
captain doblin's
record to be expunged.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.194
Thinks he was acting out
because his meds were off,

41:04.196 --> 41:05.628
and if that's the case, then...

41:05.630 --> 41:08.765
Captain doblin
was a victim, too.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.033
What's gonna
happen to Janice?

41:10.035 --> 41:12.001
D.A.'S still filing charges.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.807
She did the wrong thing, but she
did it for the right reasons.

41:17.809 --> 41:22.712
And she risked her life to
try to save those hostages.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.156
Will you give this
to the d.A., please?

41:33.158 --> 41:36.025
I just want him to know.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.665
You doing okay?

41:44.636 --> 41:46.636
I was this close

41:46.638 --> 41:49.138
to violating one of my
most sacred principles.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.573
But you didn't.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.875
That bomb was fake.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.977
That's because I knew
you were coming.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.012
I just knew it.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.548
But what if I didn't?

41:58.550 --> 41:59.883
What would I have done?

41:59.885 --> 42:02.719
You'd have done
the right thing, Abbs,

42:02.721 --> 42:04.787
whatever that is.

42:06.291 --> 42:09.692
I don't know much,
but I know that.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.199
Hey, I, um...

42:16.201 --> 42:19.102
I talked to accounting.
They heard what you did.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.905
And they said they would
be happy to take the basement.

42:21.907 --> 42:25.575
As long as you promise
not to hurt them.

42:27.546 --> 42:30.113
You know what?

42:30.115 --> 42:32.115
I'm gonna stick with
the basement after all.

42:33.618 --> 42:38.254
I've had enough upstairs
fun for the next decade.
