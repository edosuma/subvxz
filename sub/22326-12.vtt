00:32.580 --> 00:34.790
HERA: All right Ezra,
you have our attention,

00:34.790 --> 00:36.790
now explain what's going on.

00:36.790 --> 00:40.790
EZRA: This stone came
from the Jedi Temple
here on Lothal.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.250
That's far to the north,
how did it get here?

00:43.250 --> 00:45.330
The Lothwolves
gave it to me.

00:45.330 --> 00:48.120
They think the Empire
is doing something
terrible there.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.540
(CHUCKLES) Okay, wait,

00:49.540 --> 00:50.920
"they think"?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.830
What, did they talk to you?

00:52.830 --> 00:54.420
Well, just the one.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.750
I wish they told you
what these symbols mean.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.040
But, mmm, maybe
I could make more

01:00.040 --> 01:02.830
sense of them if I saw
the temple up close.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.880
I agree, we have to go.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.290
I don't want the Empire
putting their hands
all over the Temple.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.830
So let's stop them.
For Kanan.

01:10.710 --> 01:12.750
There's just one problem.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.830
As Hera said,
the Temple is far
to the north,

01:14.830 --> 01:16.670
and we don't
have a ship.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.040
I can get us there.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.460
We're ready,
can you take us?

02:30.830 --> 02:33.040
Are these things
faster than speeders?

02:33.040 --> 02:35.380
Well, they got us here
in the first place.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.750
I guess they can get us
to the Temple as well.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.960
I'm just, you know,
more comfortable
with speeders...

02:42.460 --> 02:44.170

Hello, my name is Zeb.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

02:47.830 --> 02:50.710
Zeb, those ones
don't talk.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.080
How do you know?

02:52.080 --> 02:54.920
It talks, uh,
with its eyes.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.000

to the temple?

04:00.710 --> 04:02.040
You don't wanna know!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.120
Hold tight!

04:37.920 --> 04:39.210
KANAN: You want a ride?

04:39.210 --> 04:40.670
ZEB: You don't know us.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.500
EZRA: And I don't want to.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.420
KANAN: I lost my way
for a long time,

04:44.420 --> 04:47.750
but now, I have a chance
to change things.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.170
HERA: We have hope.

04:49.170 --> 04:51.040
Hope that things
can get better,

04:51.040 --> 04:53.210
and they will.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.080
KANAN: That was a mistake.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.420
GRAND INQUISITOR: Why?

04:56.420 --> 04:59.540
Because you have no one
left to die for you?

04:59.540 --> 05:00.830
KANAN: No,

05:00.830 --> 05:03.000
because I have
nothing left to fear.

AHSOKA:
This is a new day,
a new beginning...

05:08.500 --> 05:11.750
KANAN: There's a cost for
any action we take now, Ezra.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.210
Things are getting worse,
just as they did back
when I was your age.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.790
But back then

05:15.790 --> 05:18.670
there were
10,000 Jedi knights
protecting the galaxy.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.290
Now...

There's just you and me.

Hey, did you hear
those voices?

what just happened.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.250
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

06:00.460 --> 06:02.210
They say the Temple
is not far from here,

06:02.210 --> 06:04.290
just a bit
to the Northwest.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.620
But we'll have to walk
the rest of the way.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.670
Ezra, how do
they do that?

06:09.620 --> 06:11.210
I don't know.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.080
Kanan said they're deeply
connected to the Force.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.420
I'm just glad
they're on our side.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.250
They're on Lothal's side.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.460
Is there a difference?

06:23.460 --> 06:25.120
Let's hope not.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.040
(HOWLING)

06:29.250 --> 06:31.000
We should get moving.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.710
This is no
military operation.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.960
SABINE: What are they
searching for?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.620
Let me take a look.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.830
Wait, the doors,
they're both gone.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.420
And it looks like
one of them has been
cut right off the surface.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.250
Is this really the temple?

07:19.250 --> 07:20.830
It looks like solid rock.

07:20.830 --> 07:23.250
We're in the right place.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.830
It must have
sealed itself off.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.710
Any idea
what the Empire wants?

07:28.460 --> 07:29.710
No.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.330
Well, they've uncovered
a lot more artwork.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.000
Maybe I can figure it out
if I get a closer look.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.210
Agreed.

07:36.210 --> 07:38.580
You and Ezra go,
we'll keep watch
from up here.

07:38.580 --> 07:39.580
Look!

07:41.670 --> 07:43.790

need a disguise.

surrenders at this time.

they're definitely
on to something.

There's a language here.
Not... Not so much in words,
but pictures.

09:02.670 --> 09:05.960
I saw paintings like these
inside the temple.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.880
HYDAN: Trooper!

09:09.120 --> 09:11.290
Get away from there at once!

09:13.460 --> 09:15.210
I've said it before,

09:15.210 --> 09:18.000
none of you are to
touch the artifacts!

09:18.000 --> 09:20.750
The tiniest blemish
could erase evidence

09:20.750 --> 09:24.380
which is critical
to understanding
the gateway!

is contacting you.

THRAWN TROOPER:
Yes, Minister.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.000
All right you two,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.380
numbers and
clearance codes, now!

numbers and clearance.

I don't need your
numbers and clearance.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.880
You're going to
forget all about this.

10:08.830 --> 10:10.330

10:12.460 --> 10:13.620
I don't know,

10:13.620 --> 10:15.880
I've never seen
an Imperial like him.

to reroute the incoming

made some remarkable
discoveries, my Emperor.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.500
PALPATINE: We must discover
the secrets of the Temple,

10:43.500 --> 10:47.750
for even now our enemies
move against us.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.580
HYDAN: We have reached
the roots of the Temple

10:53.580 --> 10:55.420
and found some
fascinating work.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.380
The symbols and iconography

10:58.380 --> 11:00.880
are reminiscent of
a report I discovered

11:00.880 --> 11:03.380
in the Jedi archives.

11:04.380 --> 11:07.460
The Mortis gods?

11:07.460 --> 11:10.420
Yes, they are key
to unlocking the Temple,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.380
I am sure of it.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.500
There has been a great
disturbance in the Force.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.670
The death
of Kanan Jarrus

11:18.670 --> 11:21.420
has altered
the fate of Lothal,

11:21.420 --> 11:25.500
though how I cannot say.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.330
Perhaps access
to the Temple

11:30.330 --> 11:32.830
will provide some clarity,
my Lord.

11:32.830 --> 11:36.620
We must seize
the power within,

11:36.620 --> 11:40.500
a conduit between
the living and the dead.

11:41.540 --> 11:44.120
Proceed, Minister Hydan.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.620
Hera, did you hear?

11:46.620 --> 11:47.830
What should we do?

11:47.830 --> 11:49.540
I don't like it.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.170
With the Emperor involved
it's too dangerous,

11:52.170 --> 11:53.540
we should fall back.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.880
No.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.210
Because of the Emperor,
we have to get involved.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.880
We can't let him
enter the temple.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.460
Then they'll crack the code.
It's only a matter of time.

12:05.620 --> 12:06.880
Hera.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.580
Remember why we came.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.670
Go, we'll keep watch.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.880
But I want you both
out of there

12:31.880 --> 12:33.540
if I give you the order.

12:33.540 --> 12:36.500
SABINE: Absolutely.
EZRA: Thanks, Hera.
Let's go.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.330

believe that.

from the temple.

is always full of surprises.

mean anything to you?

14:17.670 --> 14:20.620
Well, I've seen
a bird like that before.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.120
Whenever Ahsoka
visited us on Atollon,

14:23.120 --> 14:24.920
it was always nearby.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.460
And look, Lothwolves.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.580
The stone the wolves
gave me...

14:38.580 --> 14:39.790
Yeah.

14:39.790 --> 14:42.040
I thought I might
need to refer to it.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.380
SABINE: (GASPS) Look!

14:44.380 --> 14:45.420
The hands,

14:47.620 --> 14:48.920
they're the same
on the figures

14:48.920 --> 14:50.830
as the ones
here on the stone.

14:50.830 --> 14:52.750
And that means something?

14:52.750 --> 14:55.040
Ezra it's art,
everything has a meaning.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.960
I think this is it.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.670
What?
The painting on the temple

15:03.670 --> 15:07.120
is like a star map,
but none that
I'm familiar with.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.960
Those lines are like paths
and the rings are planets,
or, or doorways.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.210
Okay, but which one
leads into the Temple?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.250
We're about to find out.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.330
So, how do we
open this door?

15:28.710 --> 15:29.750
Okay, look here.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.540
The hands represent
different configurations.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.580
Right now it looks like
the painting is lined up
with the central figure.

15:39.580 --> 15:43.080
I think we want this one,
where the lines are together.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.620
Great, what happens then?

15:46.620 --> 15:47.790
Well, I don't know.

It's your turn,
now do your thing.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.250
Right.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.460
Wait, what thing?

15:52.460 --> 15:54.790
Whatever it is you do
to open the Temple.

15:54.790 --> 15:57.710
Uh, Kanan and I always
opened it together.

and an apprentice,

but um,
it was just the shadows.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.790
STORMTROOPER: You should
have been informed
about the new directive.

16:59.790 --> 17:01.460
The stone...

17:01.460 --> 17:04.000
Listen to the stone
and its story.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.710
STORMTROOPER:
This is all very irregular.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.330
We're gonna
have to call it in.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.790
SABINE: If you
do that, I'll be late
for my assignment.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.460
STORMTROOPER: Like you said,
we're just following protocol.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.750
STORMTROOPER:
515, affirmative.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.120
Copy that, over.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.920
SABINE: I don't
have time for this.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.420
STORMTROOPER: Operations
says you and LS-412 deviated
from your patrol route

17:26.420 --> 17:28.880
and never finished
the perimeter sweep.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.500
SABINE: Let's go over
to operations and
straighten this out.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.120
STORMTROOPER 2: Great,
now we're both gonna
have to file a report.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.920
Listen...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.500
Kanan said to listen.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.040
THE DAUGHTER:
We are the ones
who guard the power.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.790
We are the middle,
the beginning,
and the end.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.290
(HOWLING)

18:56.000 --> 18:58.040
Sabine is going
with the troopers.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.000
Have they
found her out?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.500
I don't think so...

19:00.500 --> 19:01.540
What about Ezra?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.120
I can't tell.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.790
He went into the shadows,
but I think...

19:07.500 --> 19:08.750
What?

19:08.750 --> 19:11.540
I think the paintings moved?

19:11.540 --> 19:13.080
All right,
hand those over.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.920
You've been staring
through them too long.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.790
(HOWLING)

19:43.420 --> 19:44.620
This is it.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.000
Uh, what have we here?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
STORMTROOPER: Minister,
we're bringing this
trooper in for processing.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.670
There seems to be
a discrepancy.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.170
Indeed.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.540
Who are you
and where is your friend?

20:32.710 --> 20:33.920
Restrain her!

20:33.920 --> 20:35.920
Lock down the perimeter.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.120
Order all units
to report in,

20:38.120 --> 20:40.330
we have an imposter
loose on site!

20:40.330 --> 20:42.000
(SIREN BLARING)

20:45.000 --> 20:46.170
Gotta move!

21:04.380 --> 21:07.040
TROOPER: (OVER PA)
Intruder in
sector three grid two.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.580
STORMTROOPER 3:
There he is!

21:13.960 --> 21:15.120
The gateway!

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
Go!

21:18.210 --> 21:19.250
Stop him!
