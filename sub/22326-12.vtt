HERA: All right Ezra,
you have our attention,

00:34.790 --> 00:36.790
now explain what's going on.

00:36.790 --> 00:40.790
EZRA: This stone came
from the Jedi Temple
here on Lothal.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.250
That's far to the north,
how did it get here?

00:43.250 --> 00:45.330
The Lothwolves
gave it to me.

00:45.330 --> 00:48.120
They think the Empire
is doing something
terrible there.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.540
(CHUCKLES) Okay, wait,

00:49.540 --> 00:50.920
"they think"?

00:50.920 --> 00:52.830
What, did they talk to you?

00:52.830 --> 00:54.420
Well, just the one.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.750
I wish they told you
what these symbols mean.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.040
But, mmm, maybe
I could make more

01:00.040 --> 01:02.830
sense of them if I saw
the temple up close.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.880
I agree, we have to go.

01:04.880 --> 01:07.290
I don't want the Empire
putting their hands
all over the Temple.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.830
So let's stop them.
For Kanan.

01:10.710 --> 01:12.750
There's just one problem.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.830
As Hera said,
the Temple is far
to the north,

01:14.830 --> 01:16.670
and we don't
have a ship.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.040
I can get us there.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.460
We're ready,
can you take us?

02:30.830 --> 02:33.040
Are these things
faster than speeders?

02:33.040 --> 02:35.380
Well, they got us here
in the first place.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.750
I guess they can get us
to the Temple as well.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.960

more comfortable
with speeders...

KANAN: I lost my way
for a long time,

but now, I have a chance
to change things.

04:56.420 --> 04:59.540
Because you have no one
left to die for you?

just as they did back
when I was your age.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.790
But back then

05:15.790 --> 05:18.670
there were
10,000 Jedi knights

just a bit
to the Northwest.

But we'll have to walk
the rest of the way.

they do that?

06:09.620 --> 06:11.210
I don't know.

they're on our side.

Wait, the doors,
they're both gone.

one of them has been
cut right off the surface.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.250
Is this really the temple?

07:19.250 --> 07:20.830
It looks like solid rock.

We're in the right place.

Well, they've uncovered
a lot more artwork.

07:32.330 --> 07:35.000

if I get a closer look.

Agreed.

inside the temple.

none of you are to
touch the artifacts!

move against us.

the roots of the Temple

10:53.580 --> 10:55.420

fascinating work.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.380
The symbols and iconography

10:58.380 --> 11:00.880
are reminiscent of

in the Jedi archives.

The Mortis gods?

Yes, they are key
to unlocking the Temple,

11:12.380 --> 11:16.500
There has been a great
disturbance in the Force.

of Kanan Jarrus

the fate of Lothal,

though how I cannot say.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.330
Perhaps access
to the Temple

11:30.330 --> 11:32.830
will provide some clarity,
my Lord.

11:32.830 --> 11:36.620

the power within,

I don't like it.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.170
With the Emperor involved
it's too dangerous,

11:52.170 --> 11:53.540
we should fall back.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.880
No.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.210

we have to get involved.

enter the temple.

out of there

Whenever Ahsoka
visited us on Atollon,

14:23.120 --> 14:24.920
it was always nearby.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.460
And look, Lothwolves.

14:37.500 --> 14:38.580
The stone the wolves
gave me...

14:38.580 --> 14:39.790
Yeah.

14:39.790 --> 14:42.040
I thought I might
need to refer to it.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.380
SABINE: (GASPS) Look!

14:44.380 --> 14:45.420
The hands,

14:47.620 --> 14:48.920
they're the same
on the figures

14:48.920 --> 14:50.830
as the ones
here on the stone.

14:50.830 --> 14:52.750
And that means something?

14:52.750 --> 14:55.040
Ezra it's art,
everything has a meaning.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.960
I think this is it.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.670
What?
The painting on the temple

15:03.670 --> 15:07.120
is like a star map,
but none that
I'm familiar with.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.960
Those lines are like paths
and the rings are planets,
or, or doorways.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.210
Okay, but which one
leads into the Temple?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.250
We're about to find out.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.330
So, how do we
open this door?

15:28.710 --> 15:29.750
Okay, look here.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.540
The hands represent
different configurations.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.580
Right now it looks like
the painting is lined up
with the central figure.

15:39.580 --> 15:43.080
I think we want this one,
where the lines are together.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.620
Great, what happens then?

now do your thing.

to open the Temple.

Uh, Kanan and I always
opened it together.

SABINE: My mistake.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.790
STORMTROOPER: You should
have been informed
about the new directive.

16:59.790 --> 17:01.460
The stone...

17:01.460 --> 17:04.000
Listen to the stone
and its story.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.710
STORMTROOPER:
This is all very irregular.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.330
We're gonna
have to call it in.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.790
SABINE: If you
do that, I'll be late
for my assignment.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.460
STORMTROOPER: Like you said,
we're just following protocol.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.750
STORMTROOPER:
515, affirmative.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.120
Copy that, over.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.920
SABINE: I don't
have time for this.

17:22.920 --> 17:26.420
STORMTROOPER: Operations
says you and LS-412 deviated
from your patrol route

17:26.420 --> 17:28.880
and never finished
the perimeter sweep.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.500
SABINE: Let's go over
to operations and
straighten this out.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.120
STORMTROOPER 2: Great,
now we're both gonna
have to file a report.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.920
Listen...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.500
Kanan said to listen.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.040
THE DAUGHTER:
We are the ones
who guard the power.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.790
We are the middle,
the beginning,
and the end.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.290
(HOWLING)

18:56.000 --> 18:58.040
Sabine is going
with the troopers.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.000
Have they
found her out?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.500
I don't think so...

19:00.500 --> 19:01.540
What about Ezra?

19:02.750 --> 19:04.120
I can't tell.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.790
He went into the shadows,
but I think...

19:07.500 --> 19:08.750
What?

19:08.750 --> 19:11.540
I think the paintings moved?

19:11.540 --> 19:13.080
All right,
hand those over.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.920
You've been staring
through them too long.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.790
(HOWLING)

19:43.420 --> 19:44.620
This is it.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.000
Uh, what have we here?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
STORMTROOPER: Minister,
we're bringing this
trooper in for processing.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.670
There seems to be
a discrepancy.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.170
Indeed.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.540
Who are you
and where is your friend?

20:32.710 --> 20:33.920
Restrain her!

20:33.920 --> 20:35.920
Lock down the perimeter.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.120
Order all units
to report in,

20:38.120 --> 20:40.330
we have an imposter
loose on site!

20:40.330 --> 20:42.000
(SIREN BLARING)

20:45.000 --> 20:46.170
Gotta move!

21:04.380 --> 21:07.040
TROOPER: (OVER PA)
Intruder in
sector three grid two.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.580
STORMTROOPER 3:
There he is!

21:13.960 --> 21:15.120
The gateway!

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
Go!

21:18.210 --> 21:19.250
Stop him!
