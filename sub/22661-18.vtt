WEBVTT

00:02.785 --> 00:06.615
[honking horn loudly]

00:06.658 --> 00:08.921
All right, all right.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.924
Hey, Dad, there's this new thing
people are doing these days.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.752
It's called knocking.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.537
I'm old, you come to me.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.931
Listen, I'm on my way
to buy a new car.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.803
I'm gonna use the Burns system.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.153
The Burns car buying system
is a legend.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.764
Yeah.Your dad handed it down to you,

00:25.808 --> 00:29.290
and then you handed it down to,
well, my brother.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.683
Well, this time I want you
in the showroom with me.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.468
Wh... You and me?

00:33.511 --> 00:34.860
You always do it with Don.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.036
Oh, not today.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.299
Oh, is Don sick?

00:38.342 --> 00:39.604
Are you coming or not?

00:39.648 --> 00:40.866
Let me just go tell Andi
we're heading out.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.477
[clears throat]

00:42.520 --> 00:44.000
[car horn blaring]

00:44.044 --> 00:46.307
All right, I'm hurrying.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.265
Adam, look what Emme
just brought down

00:48.309 --> 00:50.006
from her room.
I-It's a snake!

00:50.050 --> 00:51.181
ADAM:
What? Emme,

00:51.225 --> 00:53.314
we don't allow
weird pets in the house

00:53.357 --> 00:55.316
ever since I accidentally drank
Teddy's sea monkeys.

00:55.359 --> 00:56.665
Put him back in there.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.145
But he's cute.No, no, no, honey.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.494
You're cute,

00:59.537 --> 01:01.148
'cause you have
cute little ears,

01:01.191 --> 01:03.324
and your cute little hands
and your cute little feet.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.847
Snake's got none of that.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.066
ANDI:
Yeah.

01:06.109 --> 01:08.459
Yeah, he's just a legless
killing machine.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.374
They go for the
eyeballs first, you know.

01:11.549 --> 01:12.681
Honey, you have to
get rid of it.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.726
I can't. Dad's outside,
he just invited me

01:14.770 --> 01:16.337
to do the Burns
system with him.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.860
Oh, is Don sick?

01:20.167 --> 01:21.907
No, no, he wants me.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.432
After years of having to wait
in the car and watch them do it,

01:24.475 --> 01:27.783
today I get to finally go
inside the showroom.

01:27.826 --> 01:30.090
I'm moving up!
Okay.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.396
Look, I'm all for you
bonding with your dad,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.877
but, you know,
this is your job, okay?

01:34.920 --> 01:37.097
You handle the
creepy-crawlies.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.229
What? It's just
a harmless corn snake.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.709
You can do this.

01:40.752 --> 01:44.147
You are a strong,
independent woman, okay?

01:44.191 --> 01:46.323
And in the name
of women's liberation,

01:46.367 --> 01:50.719
I will not--
no, no, I cannot

01:50.762 --> 01:52.677
do something that you
can do on your own.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.288
[car horn honks]Gotta go.

01:54.331 --> 01:55.854
Wait, you mean... Whoa!

01:55.898 --> 01:57.378
You're really going to
leave me here with a snake?

01:57.421 --> 01:59.554
Equal rights!

02:04.167 --> 02:05.560
Emme, where'd you even
get that thing?

02:05.603 --> 02:07.649
I traded it for a Twinkie
at school.

02:09.303 --> 02:12.001
Honey, y-you can't keep
that gross snake.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.394
He's not gross.

02:13.437 --> 02:16.527
His name is Brian
and I love him.

02:19.182 --> 02:23.621
What if I traded you
two Twinkies for that snake?

02:23.665 --> 02:26.537
So long, Brian.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.847
â™ª

02:40.203 --> 02:41.726
All right, this is the one.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.902
Now we just have
to make the deal.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.991
I can't believe I'm here,
doing the Burns system.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.384
I've been on the
bench so long

02:47.428 --> 02:48.820
and you finally
put me in the game.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.735
I won't let you
down, Coach.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.389
Settle down, Sally.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.390
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.131
There's the salesman.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.438
Now, here's what we do:
you be the good cop,

02:57.481 --> 03:00.005
I'll be the grouchy-old-man-
who-hates-everything cop.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.182
Roger that, partner.
[chuckles]

03:02.225 --> 03:03.618
I don't need to do that.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.837
She's a beaut, isn't she?

03:05.881 --> 03:07.491
This one's loaded.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.493
It's got radar cruise control
and parking assist.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.321
It can park itself.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.497
Sounds like it doesn't
need me. Let's go.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.890
W-Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.501
Ea-Ease up, Dad.
He's just doing his job.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.503
Sorry about that.
He's-he's pretty tough.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.852
Tell us more.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.202
Well, this is our first model

03:22.245 --> 03:24.247
with a completely digital
dashboard.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.248
There's no ignition.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.858
Where does the key go?

03:26.902 --> 03:28.860
There's actually no key,
just a fob.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.732
You're a fob.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.344
He likes to make the names
of things into insults.

03:34.388 --> 03:37.695
[chuckles]: Yeah. Yesterday,
he called me a doorbell.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.044
[chuckles]

03:39.088 --> 03:40.698
Well, I should tell you
about the Bluetooth.

03:40.742 --> 03:41.873
You're a Bluetooth.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.875
Reggie. It's actually Reggie.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.094
[chuckles]Hey, Dad,

03:45.137 --> 03:47.227
why don't you, uh,
have a seat? Let me talk

03:47.270 --> 03:49.316
to this guy for a second, huh?

03:51.013 --> 03:53.972
Hey, listen, uh,

03:54.016 --> 03:56.279
neither of us wants to spend our
whole Saturday dealing with him.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.281
Okay? So we need to be
on the same team.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.935
Thanks. You think we can get him
to take a test drive?

03:59.978 --> 04:02.329
'Cause that's where I shine.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.940
Definitely. I mean, you're gonna
have to throw in chrome wheels

04:04.983 --> 04:05.941
if we buy the car.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.856
I can swing that.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.858
Good, good. Oh, and, also,
you're gonna need to take him

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
to a drive-through and
buy us some breakfast.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.166
He needs to see if he can eat
and drive at the same time.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.081
I don't have any cash.Oh, don't worry.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.605
We'll take you to an ATM.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.259
[sighs]Reggie, Reggie,

04:19.302 --> 04:21.130
I don't want to see
you lose this sale.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.523
Okay.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.002
I'll grab the fob.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.091
I mean the key.
We'll call it a key.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.919
I like you, Reggie.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.617
I knew right away
you were special.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.010
[chuckles]

04:34.230 --> 04:35.579
How'd it go?

04:35.623 --> 04:37.015
You get the
chrome wheels?

04:37.059 --> 04:39.627
Not only that-- I got him
to throw in breakfast.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.543
Oh! Oh, Donny never did that.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.719
Welcome to the bigs, son.

04:44.762 --> 04:47.156
Yeah.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.113
What's the matter?

04:48.157 --> 04:49.854
I-I just got something
in my eye.

04:53.684 --> 04:56.513
Look at him.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.429
Just staring at me.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.606
Trying to figure out how to get
all of me in his mouth.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.000
So what are you gonna do
with it?

05:05.043 --> 05:06.784
Well, how 'bout this?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.351
I leave the room,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.527
and then you take care
of it however you want.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.138
And, uh, if I hear the blender,

05:13.182 --> 05:14.575
no judgments.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.752
I am not blending your snake,
okay?

05:17.795 --> 05:20.320
I am not touching that thing
at all.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.582
Well, I don't want
to touch it either.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.757
Well, then we're stuck.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.802
What happened to me?

05:24.846 --> 05:27.109
You know? I mean,
I-I used to take care of

05:27.152 --> 05:29.633
all the creepy-crawlies
before I got married.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.983
And I was good at it.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.116
I think having a husband's
made me soft.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.596
Oh.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.597
That's not good.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.989
I read on the Internet that,

05:38.033 --> 05:40.688
in ten years, there won't be
any men left at all.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.692
They carry their phones
in their front pocket,

05:44.735 --> 05:46.346
and the radiation
is turning them all

05:46.389 --> 05:48.739
into a bunch of Ken dolls.

05:50.262 --> 05:53.962
[groans] I've never gotten sick
from a test drive before.

05:54.005 --> 05:56.486
I do panic stops
to make sure the brakes work.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.141
Hey, thanks again
for breakfast.

05:59.184 --> 06:01.317
Sorry you couldn't
keep yours down.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.363
I don't trust a guy
with a weak stomach.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.930
Let's go to the dealer
next door.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.195
Okay, listen,
you're losing him.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.850
You're gonna have to sweeten the
pot with an extended warranty.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.765
Okay. Okay, I'll
see what I can do.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.288
Great, great. And on your way
back, don't be afraid

06:16.332 --> 06:18.073
to bring us some
of your fancy coffees.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.902
All right? He gets sleepy
after a big breakfast.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.556
All right.And maybe get yourself a mint.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.778
This is going great.
He's agreeing to everything.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.215
Yeah! And here comes
phase two.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.261
Oh, what's phase two?Donny.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.046
What's he doing here?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.396
I called in a closer.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.094
Closer? Dad, I can be a closer.

06:39.137 --> 06:42.227
I'm here.
Where's the mark?

06:42.271 --> 06:43.707
Why don't you mind
your own business?

06:43.751 --> 06:45.405
Lowell, are you part
of this?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.145
I've just heard so much
about the Burns system,

06:47.189 --> 06:48.451
I had to see it in person.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.887
Did you come
to watch, too?

06:50.932 --> 06:52.716
No! I'm doing it.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.414
I was here first.

06:54.457 --> 06:57.112
Oh, good, there's
more of you.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.941
This is my older son.
He's a real car expert.

06:59.984 --> 07:03.074
That's right. I've been riding
in cars since I was a kid.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.641
Started in the backseat.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.905
Did so well, they
moved me up front.

07:07.949 --> 07:10.647
I thought
we were doing great together.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.128
Yeah. Just watch him work.
The kid is a star.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.044
Hey, let me ask
you something.

07:16.087 --> 07:19.351
Are there any ghosts
in that car?What?

07:19.395 --> 07:21.528
Is the car ghost-free?
It's a basic question, man.

07:21.571 --> 07:25.401
You seem like the kind of guy
that might sell me a ghost car.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.229
Where does he
get this stuff?

07:27.272 --> 07:30.754
From me. You know
how much time we spend together.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.716
ANDI:
Okay, well,

07:35.759 --> 07:37.718
I called the zoo,
I called the pet store.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.284
Nobody wants Brian.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.764
And most of the people
I talked to

07:40.808 --> 07:42.244
tried to get me
to take their snakes.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.769
I guess we leave the snake here
and you just move.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.076
It's Brian's house now.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.948
No, he's going
to the pet store, okay?

07:50.992 --> 07:53.603
We'll just take him out of
the box and we'll sneak him in.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.779
How are we gonna get the
snake from here to the store

07:55.823 --> 07:58.086
if neither one of us
wants to touch it?

07:58.129 --> 08:02.003
[gasps] I know. We'll sneak him
in there in my other purse.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.135
It's snakeskin.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.485
[gasps]

08:05.528 --> 08:06.964
He'll feel right at home.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.619
Okay. All right. So...

08:09.663 --> 08:10.968
[groans]Ew.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.014
Uh...

08:14.015 --> 08:16.321
Okay, Brian, jump on in.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.149
Come on.
[whistles]

08:18.193 --> 08:19.629
Come on. You can do it, boy!

08:19.673 --> 08:20.978
Come on.
[whistles]

08:21.022 --> 08:22.632
Come on!Yeah, I don't think

08:22.676 --> 08:25.287
snakes follow directions
without a flute.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.725
Okay. Well, uh...

08:28.769 --> 08:30.161
you hold the purse.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.989
[sniffs][groans]

08:32.033 --> 08:33.643
All right, ready?Ugh.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.210
Here goes nothing.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.038
[groans]

08:38.039 --> 08:40.520
[groans][moaning]

08:41.259 --> 08:42.870
We did it!

08:42.913 --> 08:44.219
Yeah.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.221
[panting]Huh. All right.

08:46.264 --> 08:49.529
[chuckles]Good job, us.
[chuckles]

08:49.572 --> 08:52.140
There's an old Twizzler
in there.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.883
Oh, maybe he'll fall in love.

08:57.493 --> 09:00.452
All right. All Dad has to do
is sign on the dotted line.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.019
You can thank me
later.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.544
Whatever. We were
doing fine without you.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.546
Hey, you got your dad
a great car.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.983
Does it diminish it just because
your brother helped?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.985
Yes!

09:11.028 --> 09:13.248
Don't you know how family works?

09:13.291 --> 09:14.466
JOE:
Forget it.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.642
I'm not signing this.

09:15.685 --> 09:16.860
What happened?

09:16.904 --> 09:19.733
None of your Bluetooth
business, fobbo.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.343
Is that part
of the system?

09:21.386 --> 09:23.737
Who knows?
Nobody tells me anything.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.477
This is
definitely new.

09:25.521 --> 09:26.522
I'm leaving.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.741
What?Yeah.

09:27.784 --> 09:28.785
What about the car?

09:28.829 --> 09:30.004
I don't need a car.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.658
I don't know, Dad.
I liked that car, too.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.920
Who asked you?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.617
Dad, this is me, Donny.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.315
That's the voice
you use for Adam.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.100
Okay, I think we should
all just settle down.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.275
You want a piece of this?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.190
No, sir.

09:42.233 --> 09:44.148
How can I have a piece of it
when I'm all the way over there?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.716
Just tell me what happened.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.500
I don't have
to tell you anything.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.893
What, are you waiting
for me to leave

09:49.937 --> 09:51.591
so you can tell
your number one son?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.810
He's too emotional. I should
have left him in the car.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.030
Okay, you know
what? I'm leaving.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.640
I wasted my whole
Saturday because I wanted

09:57.684 --> 09:59.511
to get closer to you.
But I'm through trying.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.601
Maybe you two can go to Six
Flags together again, huh?

10:01.644 --> 10:03.341
Which I know you took him
to, even though you said

10:03.385 --> 10:04.865
you were going
to the doctor.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.954
Nobody comes home from a
checkup with cotton candy.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.044
[exhales]

10:10.087 --> 10:12.220
I told you
to ditch the cotton candy,

10:12.263 --> 10:14.048
but you had to be a show-off.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.659
It was my half-birthday.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.530
Just take me home, Donny.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.532
[scoffs]

10:20.576 --> 10:21.838
They left?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.623
I think something went
wrong with their system.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.363
Oh, they have a system?

10:25.407 --> 10:28.497
Teach it to me.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.238
I-I shouldn't.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.848
I've already said too much.

10:31.892 --> 10:36.157
We can offer you
complimentary flavored Perrier.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.336
Okay.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.523
Well, hello.

10:54.566 --> 10:55.698
Hi. [chuckles]

10:55.742 --> 10:57.918
Uh, we are shopping
for a snake.

10:57.961 --> 11:00.137
Ah, so you're snakies like me.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.836
Sure, yeah.
Love snakes.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.099
H-H-How they don't
have feet and stuff.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.318
[chuckles] So, uh,
so where are they?

11:07.362 --> 11:11.235
Okay, my serpent friends are
chilling along the back wall.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.673
It's a, uh, cold-blooded joke.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.719
[laughs]
That's terrifying.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.461
Um, do-do... uh,
if you don't mind,

11:19.504 --> 11:20.767
we'd like a moment
alone to browse.

11:20.810 --> 11:21.942
Yeah, of course.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.074
Okay.
Great.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.120
All right,
all right, all right,

11:26.163 --> 11:27.425
let's get rid
of this thing.
Okay.

11:27.469 --> 11:31.125
Adios, Brian.

11:31.168 --> 11:34.171
Hey.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.999
You're trying to leave a snake.

11:36.043 --> 11:39.655
This happens every time
a woman comes in here.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.787
[gasps]
Look, another woman.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.140
Brian?

11:46.183 --> 11:48.708
What? Where is he?

11:48.751 --> 11:49.970
I think we both
closed our eyes

11:50.013 --> 11:51.014
when you were putting him
in your purse.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.494
I'll bet he never
made it in.

11:52.537 --> 11:56.106
That means there's a
snake loose in my house.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.674
Ooh. Sounds like
my kind of house.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.458
[clears throat]

12:00.502 --> 12:01.808
Okay, a little tip.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.418
Um, you're creepy. Stop it.

12:07.552 --> 12:10.207
Hey. How was car
shopping with Grandpa?

12:10.251 --> 12:12.470
All right, listen, guys.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.169
I just want you to know that
I love all of you equally.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.910
If I take one of you
to Six Flags,

12:16.953 --> 12:18.738
I take all of you
to Six Flags.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.565
We're going to Six Flags?

12:20.609 --> 12:22.916
No, no, it's too expensive
to take all of you.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.004
Go read a book.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.183
[sighs]

12:32.055 --> 12:34.797
[scoffs]

12:34.841 --> 12:36.625
Where is the remote?

12:43.284 --> 12:45.721
Aah!

12:55.209 --> 12:57.037
[laughing]:
Yeah.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.779
You better run.

12:59.822 --> 13:03.565
That scream was a war cry.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.048
It's been 20 minutes and
there's still no sign of Brian.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.136
Wait.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.964
Can a snake climb stairs?

13:11.007 --> 13:12.835
Let's say no.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.316
I can't find him.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.318
We may need to buy a hawk.

13:17.361 --> 13:20.408
Okay, let's just sit
down and look like

13:20.451 --> 13:22.236
we're not paying attention
and then, you know,

13:22.279 --> 13:23.585
maybe Brian'll come out

13:23.628 --> 13:26.022
and, you know,
try to murder us.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.545
Hey.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.026
How was your big, special
day with your dad?

13:30.070 --> 13:31.854
Ugh. He brought Don in,

13:31.898 --> 13:34.030
so I think it was
their big, special day.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.076
Aw. I'm sorry, honey.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.555
Ah, it's okay.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.600
I'm fine.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.384
I'm the number two son.

13:40.428 --> 13:43.735
If I'm that guy,
I'm that guy.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.868
And being number two
is not bad.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.609
No, like Batman and Robin.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.089
Sure, Batman gets
all the glory,

13:49.132 --> 13:50.830
but Robin...
[chuckles]

13:52.919 --> 13:56.183
Who am I kidding?
Robin sucks.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.620
Adam, you've got to tell
your dad how you feel.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.275
Look, I can't have a real
conversation with that guy.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.886
You know, emotional stuff's
your department.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.714
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

14:05.757 --> 14:07.281
I'm not great at
your stuff, either.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.805
I mean, being married
has made me soft.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.025
I mean, you do all
the yucky stuff for me.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.287
But I thought
you liked that.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.811
Well, I did, but
now I just...

14:15.855 --> 14:17.944
I'm a little disappointed
in myself, you know?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.336
I don't understand why
I can't... [gasps]

14:19.380 --> 14:20.468
Adam, there's Brian.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.469
Get him. Get him.Okay.

14:21.512 --> 14:22.992
Uh...

14:23.036 --> 14:25.647
No.
What?

14:25.690 --> 14:27.040
Pick up that snake, Andi.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.302
This is your moment.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.956
What? No, it's not.
Yeah.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.175
You want to do it, right?
So do it.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.176
Well, I can't.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.048
Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.571
You remember when
Teddy was little,

14:36.614 --> 14:37.833
and his nose
was all stuffed up

14:37.877 --> 14:39.008
and you had to pull
all that gunk out?

14:39.052 --> 14:40.531
And it just kept
coming and coming

14:40.575 --> 14:42.490
and coming like
a magician's scarf?

14:42.533 --> 14:44.753
Huh? Only it
wasn't a scarf.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.016
It was a snot snake.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.758
That's much worse
than a real snake.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.151
I did do that.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.501
Yes, you did
and you can do this.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.590
Yeah.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.157
Okay.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.245
Yeah.
I'm doing it.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.507
Okay.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.117
I'm doing it right now.Yeah.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.035
You got to get
a little closer.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.819
Oh.

15:07.863 --> 15:08.995
Okay.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.388
Hey, little buddy.
Come on.

15:11.432 --> 15:12.607
I'm gonna pick you up now.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.218
Here I come.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.742
Stay away from my eyeballs.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.092
Aah.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.745
Look at you.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.747
I know. I did it.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.532
[laughs]I did it!

15:24.575 --> 15:26.142
Oh, sorry, Brian.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.668
Aw. Hey, you know what?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.975
He is kind of cute.

15:33.019 --> 15:33.845
Mm.
[chuckles]

15:33.889 --> 15:36.109
Hey, maybe
we could keep him.

15:36.152 --> 15:37.414
What does he eat?

15:37.458 --> 15:38.676
Dead baby mice.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.069
So long, Brian.

15:40.113 --> 15:42.767
There you go.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.206
Hi, Andi.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.468
Hey, Joe.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.513
Enough small talk.
Let's eat.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.167
You know,

15:51.211 --> 15:53.822
any time you make
my mother's beef stew recipe,

15:53.865 --> 15:54.866
I come running.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.433
I do know that.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.000
And I-I told a little fib.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.915
Yeah, you're not here
to have beef stew.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.222
You're here to have
feelings with Adam.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.398
What?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.183
I smell Grandma's beef stew.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.969
[chuckles]
Wait.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.753
What's he doing here?

16:11.796 --> 16:12.754
ANDI:
I called your father

16:12.797 --> 16:14.190
over here because, you know,

16:14.234 --> 16:16.192
you helped me with my thing,

16:16.236 --> 16:18.890
so now I'm gonna
help you with yours.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.415
[groans]
This is your moment.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.678
[whispering]:
Pick up that snake.

16:24.766 --> 16:25.897
I don't want to.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.769
Ah, no talking, no stew.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.727
All right? I will dump this
in the sink right now.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.773
Okay, no, no, no, no.No, no, no, no.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.951
Let me see it.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.216
[groans]

16:40.260 --> 16:42.218
Damn, that looks good.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.570
Okay, fine.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.050
Okay.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.921
Then I will leave you to it.

16:49.965 --> 16:53.751
And if I don't hear feelings,
the stew gets it.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.937
You got something to say to me?

17:05.981 --> 17:07.678
You got something
to say to me?

17:09.506 --> 17:10.942
Okay, fine. I'll start.

17:13.336 --> 17:16.557
I thought we were gonna do the
Burns system just the two of us,

17:16.600 --> 17:18.124
like you and Don always did.

17:18.167 --> 17:21.649
Then you brought
him in and...

17:21.692 --> 17:23.564
I got my feelings hurt.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.653
That's what the yelling
was all about?

17:25.696 --> 17:28.482
The Burns system was
never a two-man operation.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.353
Well, then who else
was in it?

17:30.397 --> 17:32.529
Some other guy
I don't even know about?

17:32.573 --> 17:33.922
You!

17:33.965 --> 17:35.793
You were the kid in the car

17:35.837 --> 17:37.404
that had a baseball
game to get to.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.754
You were our clock
to rush the guy.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.886
Then why did Don
always get to go inside?

17:41.930 --> 17:44.019
It had to be you inside the car.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.239
Nobody's gonna feel sorry
for Don sitting out there

17:46.282 --> 17:49.677
with his head sticking out
of the sun roof like a giraffe.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.724
So I was in it.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.249
Yeah.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.990
There was never
a Burns system without you.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.606
I see.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.434
What's the matter?

18:07.477 --> 18:12.134
I got something
in my eye again.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.136
Must be allergy season.Yeah.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.485
You got something
in your eye, too?

18:15.529 --> 18:16.834
No.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.228
I'm just

18:19.272 --> 18:21.143
sorry that we didn't
close the deal.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.666
Yeah, what happened back there?

18:22.710 --> 18:23.754
Why didn't you buy the car?

18:23.798 --> 18:25.147
It's not important.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.411
Andi, Dad won't tell me
what he's feeling.

18:28.455 --> 18:31.849
All right. All...
all right.

18:31.893 --> 18:35.331
The thing is, when I went
to close the deal,

18:35.375 --> 18:38.943
the salesman said that that car
would last me a good 15 years.

18:38.987 --> 18:40.249
So?

18:40.293 --> 18:43.165
So, I-I realized this might be
my last car.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.168
It just kind of hit me.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.562
Oh.

18:51.391 --> 18:54.220
Well... I get it.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.179
It happens.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.357
I fell asleep sitting in a chair
at Ikea the other day.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.795
That's not something
a young man does.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.362
[chuckles]

19:06.406 --> 19:08.538
Listen, napping is one
of the perks of old age.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.627
We should go to
a baseball game together.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.456
That's a good three and
a half hour siesta.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.722
Hey, I got an idea.
Huh?

19:18.766 --> 19:20.811
Let's lease you a car.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.596
Those only last
a couple years.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.815
Oh, I like the sound of that.

19:24.859 --> 19:25.903
Good.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.209
Yeah, good.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.646
Listen, um,

19:29.690 --> 19:32.127
don't tell Don about
what I-I told you.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.912
He doesn't like to talk
about feelings like you do.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.262
Oh.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.220
Because you guys aren't
as close as we are?

19:38.264 --> 19:42.790
No. Because he lacks your
overabundance of lady hormones.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.794
[both chuckle]

19:51.407 --> 19:52.974
Aw, I'm really proud
of you both.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.845
Hey. Here, look at me.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.500
Say "feelings."

20:00.634 --> 20:02.723
Oh! That's going
on the Christmas card

20:02.766 --> 20:04.594
and you can't stop me.

20:04.638 --> 20:07.423
She's bossy, but she
sure makes a fine stew.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.599
Well, she's good
at a lot of things.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.819
You should see her
handle a snake.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.653
I don't want to hear
about your private life.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.528
What's happening?
ANDI:
Hey, Don.

20:25.572 --> 20:29.358
It's stew night and
nobody called me?

20:29.402 --> 20:30.925
Come on. There's plenty.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.754
Already picked out most
of the good stuff, anyway.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.368
What's wrong with you?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.327
I just bought a car.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.549
The salesman offered me
free Perrier

20:46.593 --> 20:47.898
and the next thing I know,
I'm driving home

20:47.942 --> 20:50.161
in a new 15-passenger van.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.905
I don't even know 15 people.
