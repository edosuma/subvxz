00:46.912 --> 00:49.013
Through the darkness

00:49.015 --> 00:53.250
of the pathways that we marched,

00:54.319 --> 00:57.354
evil and good lived side by side.

00:57.356 --> 01:00.424
And this is the nature of... of life.

01:16.541 --> 01:18.842
<i>We are in an unbalanced</i>

01:18.844 --> 01:23.047
<i>and inequivalent confrontation between democracies</i>

01:23.049 --> 01:25.416
<i>who are obliged to play by the rules</i>

01:26.051 --> 01:29.486
<i>and entities who think democracy is a joke.</i>

01:31.590 --> 01:33.958
You can't convince fanatics

01:33.960 --> 01:38.562
by saying, "hey, hatred paralyzes you,

01:38.564 --> 01:40.164
love releases you."

01:41.266 --> 01:45.536
There are different rules that we have to play by.

02:01.119 --> 02:03.787
Female newsreader: <i>Today, two of Iran's top nuclear scientists</i>

02:03.789 --> 02:05.756
<i>were targeted by hit squads.</i>

02:05.758 --> 02:07.791
Female newsreader 2: <i>...In the capital Tehran.</i>

02:07.793 --> 02:09.425
Male newsreader: <i>...The latest in a string of attacks.</i>

02:09.428 --> 02:11.662
Female newsreader 3: <i>Today's attack has all the hallmarks</i>

02:11.664 --> 02:13.831
<i>of major strategic sabotage.</i>

02:13.833 --> 02:14.932
Female newsreader 4: <i>Iran immediately accused</i>

02:14.934 --> 02:16.166
<i>the U.S. and Israel</i>

02:16.168 --> 02:18.035
<i>of trying to damage its nuclear program.</i>

02:18.336 --> 02:19.700
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad:

02:19.700 --> 02:20.889
Unfortunately, and without any doubt,

02:21.140 --> 02:23.600
in the assassinations
which took place today

02:23.934 --> 02:27.774
Western countries and the
Zionist regime were involved.

02:28.080 --> 02:33.817
I want to categorically deny any United States involvement

02:33.819 --> 02:38.756
in any kind of act of violence inside Iran.

02:38.758 --> 02:41.925
Covert actions can help,

02:41.927 --> 02:43.927
can assist.

02:45.196 --> 02:48.098
They are needed, they are not all the time essential,

02:48.333 --> 02:52.770
and they, in no way, can replace political wisdom.

02:53.138 --> 02:55.372
Alex Gibney: Were the assassinations in Iran

02:55.374 --> 02:57.775
related to the STUXnet computer attacks?

02:58.943 --> 03:00.778
Uh, next question, please.

03:02.380 --> 03:03.947
Male newsreader: <i>Iran's infrastructure</i>

03:03.949 --> 03:05.049
<i>is being targeted</i>

03:05.051 --> 03:08.218
<i>by a new and dangerously powerful cyber worm.</i>

03:08.220 --> 03:10.854
The so-called STUXnet worm is specifically designed,

03:10.856 --> 03:13.190
it seems, to infiltrate and sabotage

03:13.192 --> 03:16.326
<i>real-world power plants and factories and refineries.</i>

03:16.328 --> 03:17.728
Male newsreader 2: <i>It's not trying to steal information</i>

03:17.730 --> 03:18.896
<i>or grab your credit card,</i>

03:18.898 --> 03:21.699
<i>they're trying to get into some sort of industrial plant</i>

03:21.701 --> 03:24.085
<i>and wreak havoc trying to blow up an engine or...</i>

03:24.085 --> 03:25.376
The Stuxnet virus
has made attacks worldwide.

03:25.376 --> 03:26.788
Male newsreader 3:

03:26.788 --> 03:31.585
In Iran alone it was identified
30 thousand times.

03:32.336 --> 03:37.336
A super computer virus has put on alert
several countries' secret services.

03:37.591 --> 03:40.551
The information could be
in the reach of terrorists.

03:40.552 --> 03:41.652
Male newsreader 4: <i>No one knows</i>

03:41.654 --> 03:42.820
<i>who's behind the worm</i>

03:42.822 --> 03:44.488
<i>and the exact nature of its mission,</i>

03:44.490 --> 03:47.357
<i>but there are fears Iran will hold Israel</i>

03:47.359 --> 03:50.728
<i>or America responsible and seek retaliation.</i>

03:50.730 --> 03:51.829
Male newsreader 5: <i>It's not impossible that</i>

03:51.831 --> 03:53.163
<i>some group of hackers did it,</i>

03:53.165 --> 03:55.232
<i>but the security experts that are studying this</i>

03:55.234 --> 03:58.001
<i>really think this required the resource of a nation-state.</i>

04:03.942 --> 04:05.876
Man: Okay, and spinning.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.344
Gibney: Okay, good. Here we go.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.882
What impact, ultimately, did the STUXnet attack have?

04:11.884 --> 04:13.150
Can you say?

04:13.952 --> 04:16.120
I don't want to get into the details.

04:16.353 --> 04:18.856
Gibney: Since the event has already happened,

04:18.858 --> 04:22.559
why can't we talk more openly and publicly about STUXnet?

04:22.561 --> 04:25.462
Yeah, I mean, my answer is because it's classified.

04:25.930 --> 04:29.032
I... I won't knowledge... you know, knowingly

04:29.034 --> 04:31.135
offer up anything I consider classified.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.370
Gibney: I know that you can't talk much about STUXnet,

04:33.372 --> 04:36.774
because STUXnet is officially classified.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.142
You're right on both those counts.

04:38.610 --> 04:39.943
Gibney: But there has been

04:39.945 --> 04:42.045
a lot reported about it in the press.

04:42.047 --> 04:44.281
I don't want to comment on this.

04:44.283 --> 04:48.552
I read it in the newspaper, the media, like you,

04:48.554 --> 04:51.555
but I'm unable to elaborate upon it.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.957
People might find it frustrating

04:53.959 --> 04:56.493
not to be able to talk about it when it's in the public domain,

04:56.495 --> 04:57.895
but...

04:57.897 --> 04:59.396
Gibney: I find it frustrating.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.898
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.466
I don't answer that question.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.834
Unfortunately, I can't comment.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.469
I do not know how to answer that.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.638
Two answers before you even get started, I don't know,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.440
and if I did, we wouldn't talk about it anyway.

05:10.442 --> 05:12.276
Gibney: How can you have a debate if everything's secret?

05:12.278 --> 05:14.311
I think right now that's just where we are.

05:14.612 --> 05:16.079
No one wants to...

05:16.081 --> 05:18.482
Countries aren't happy about confessing

05:18.484 --> 05:21.285
or owning up to what they did because they're not quite sure

05:21.287 --> 05:23.153
where they want the system to go.

05:23.788 --> 05:25.756
<i>And so whoever was behind STUXnet</i>

05:25.758 --> 05:27.257
<i>hasn't admitted they were behind it.</i>

05:31.095 --> 05:32.963
Gibney: <i>Asking officials about STUXnet</i>

05:32.965 --> 05:34.498
<i>was frustrating and surreal,</i>

05:34.799 --> 05:37.334
<i>like asking the emperor about his new clothes.</i>

05:38.036 --> 05:41.138
<i>Even after the cyber weapon had penetrated computers</i>

05:41.140 --> 05:42.539
<i>all over the world,</i>

05:42.807 --> 05:45.108
<i>no one was willing to admit it was loose</i>

05:45.110 --> 05:47.511
<i>or talk about the dangers it posed.</i>

05:48.379 --> 05:50.647
<i>What was it about the STUXnet operation</i>

05:50.649 --> 05:52.449
<i>that was hiding in plain sight?</i>

05:53.885 --> 05:55.652
<i>Maybe there was a way the computer code</i>

05:55.654 --> 05:57.287
<i>could speak for itself.</i>

05:58.056 --> 06:00.424
<i>STUXnet first surfaced in Belarus.</i>

06:00.992 --> 06:03.360
<i>I started with a call to the man who discovered it</i>

06:03.362 --> 06:06.363
<i>when his clients in Iran began to panic</i>

06:06.365 --> 06:09.032
<i>over an epidemic of computer shutdowns.</i>

06:09.834 --> 06:13.070
Had you ever seen anything quite so sophisticated before?

06:13.664 --> 06:17.424
I have seen very sophisticated
viruses before,

06:17.668 --> 06:21.548
but they didn't have...

06:24.008 --> 06:25.378
this kind of...

06:26.969 --> 06:27.719
zero day.

06:29.054 --> 06:32.524
It was the first time in my practice.

06:33.350 --> 06:36.440
That led me to understand

06:37.813 --> 06:44.783
that I should notify
web security companies ASAP

06:46.530 --> 06:51.030
about the fact that such a danger exists.

07:36.487 --> 07:38.322
Eric Chien: <i>On a daily basis, basically</i>

07:38.324 --> 07:40.390
<i>we are sifting through</i>

07:40.392 --> 07:43.894
<i>a massive haystack looking for that proverbial needle.</i>

07:44.762 --> 07:47.731
We get millions of pieces of new malicious threats

07:47.733 --> 07:49.599
and there are millions of attacks going on

07:49.601 --> 07:50.801
every single day.

07:50.969 --> 07:53.403
And only way are trying to protect people

07:53.405 --> 07:55.005
and their computers and... and their systems

07:55.007 --> 07:57.674
and countries' infrastructure

07:57.676 --> 07:59.776
from being taken down by those attacks.

07:59.778 --> 08:03.113
But more importantly, we have to find the attacks that matter.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.848
When you're talking about that many,

08:05.149 --> 08:07.417
impact is extremely important.

08:19.797 --> 08:21.498
Eugene Kaspersky: <i>Twenty years ago, the antivirus companies,</i>

08:21.500 --> 08:23.200
they were hunting for computer viruses

08:23.202 --> 08:24.468
because there were not so many.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.771
So we had, like, tens of dozens a month,

08:27.972 --> 08:30.540
and there was just little numbers.

08:30.542 --> 08:34.745
Now, we collect millions of unique attacks every month.

08:36.114 --> 08:38.548
Vitaly Kamluk: <i>This room we call a woodpecker's room</i>

08:38.549 --> 08:39.883
<i>or a virus lab,</i>

08:40.118 --> 08:42.052
and this is where <i>virus analysts sit.</i>

08:42.054 --> 08:44.020
<i>We call them woodpeckers because they are</i>

08:44.023 --> 08:46.523
<i>pecking the worms, network worms, and viruses.</i>

08:47.392 --> 08:50.627
<i>And we see, like, three different groups of hackers</i>

08:50.629 --> 08:52.195
behind cyber-attacks.

08:52.964 --> 08:54.731
They are traditional cyber criminals.

08:54.899 --> 08:58.735
Those guys are interested only in illegal profit.

08:58.737 --> 09:00.137
And quick and dirty money.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.305
<i>Activists, or hacktivists,</i>

09:02.307 --> 09:04.674
<i>they are hacking for fun or hacking to push</i>

09:04.676 --> 09:05.942
<i>some political message.</i>

09:06.177 --> 09:08.545
<i>And the third group is nation-states.</i>

09:08.746 --> 09:11.648
<i>They're interested in high-quality intelligence</i>

09:11.650 --> 09:13.083
<i>or sabotage activity.</i>

09:14.352 --> 09:16.853
Chien: <i>Security companies not only share information</i>

09:16.855 --> 09:18.588
<i>but we also share binary samples.</i>

09:18.590 --> 09:20.190
<i>So when this threat was found</i>

09:20.192 --> 09:22.025
<i>by a Belarusian security company</i>

09:22.027 --> 09:24.361
<i>on one of their customer's machines in Iran,</i>

09:24.363 --> 09:26.963
<i>the sample was shared amongst the security community.</i>

09:27.865 --> 09:29.433
When we try to name threats, we just try to pick

09:29.435 --> 09:31.501
some sort of string, some sort of words,

09:31.503 --> 09:34.071
<i>that are inside of the binary.</i>

09:35.239 --> 09:37.607
<i>In this case, there was a couple of words in there</i>

09:37.609 --> 09:40.577
<i>and we took pieces of each, and that formed STUXnet.</i>

09:43.047 --> 09:46.249
I got the news about STUXnet from one of my engineers.

09:46.251 --> 09:48.952
He came to my office, opened the door,

09:49.520 --> 09:52.522
and he said, "so, Eugene, of course you know that

09:52.524 --> 09:55.125
we are waiting for something really bad.

09:55.426 --> 09:56.593
It happened."

10:03.301 --> 10:05.469
Gibney: <i>Give me some sense of what it was like</i>

10:05.471 --> 10:06.870
in the lab at that time.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.472
Was there a palpable sense of amazement

10:08.474 --> 10:10.474
that you had something really different there?

10:10.775 --> 10:12.776
Well, I wouldn't call it amazement.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.845
It was a kind of a shock.

10:15.246 --> 10:18.381
It went beyond our worst fears, our worst nightmares,

10:18.749 --> 10:21.751
and this continued the more we analyzed.

10:21.753 --> 10:23.720
The more we researched,

10:23.722 --> 10:26.723
the more bizarre the whole story got.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.725
We look at so much malware every day that

10:28.727 --> 10:30.660
we can just look at the code and straightaway we can say,

10:30.662 --> 10:32.262
"okay, there's something bad going on here,

10:32.264 --> 10:33.730
and I need to investigate that."

10:33.732 --> 10:34.798
And that's the way it was

10:34.999 --> 10:36.933
when we looked at STUXnet for the first time.

10:36.935 --> 10:39.436
We opened it up and there was just bad things everywhere.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.905
Just like, okay, this is bad and that's bad,

10:41.907 --> 10:43.440
and, you know, we need to investigate this.

10:43.442 --> 10:44.908
And just suddenly we had, like,

10:44.910 --> 10:46.376
a hundred questions straightaway.

10:48.412 --> 10:50.847
<i>The most interesting thing that we do is detective work</i>

10:50.849 --> 10:53.517
<i>where we try to track down who's behind a threat,</i>

10:53.519 --> 10:55.085
<i>what are they doing, what's their motivation,</i>

10:55.087 --> 10:56.820
<i>and try to really stop it at the root.</i>

10:56.822 --> 10:59.189
<i>And it is kind of all-consuming.</i>

10:59.191 --> 11:00.824
<i>You get this new puzzle</i>

11:00.826 --> 11:02.526
<i>and it's very difficult to put it down,</i>

11:02.528 --> 11:04.961
<i>you know, work until, like, 4:00 am in the morning</i>

11:04.963 --> 11:06.163
<i>and figure these things out.</i>

11:06.165 --> 11:08.965
<i>And I was in that zone where I was very consumed by this,</i>

11:08.967 --> 11:11.101
<i>very excited about it, very interested to know</i>

11:11.103 --> 11:12.369
<i>what was happening.</i>

11:12.371 --> 11:15.505
<i>And Eric was also in that same sort of zone.</i>

11:15.507 --> 11:18.208
<i>So the two of us were, like, back and forth all the time.</i>

11:18.210 --> 11:20.944
Chien: <i>Liam and I continued to grind at the code,</i>

11:20.946 --> 11:23.046
<i>sharing pieces, comparing notes,</i>

11:23.048 --> 11:24.881
<i>bouncing ideas off of each other.</i>

11:25.316 --> 11:26.783
<i>We realized that we needed to do</i>

11:26.785 --> 11:29.853
<i>what we called deep analysis, pick apart the threat,</i>

11:29.855 --> 11:32.689
<i>every single byte, every single zero, one,</i>

11:32.691 --> 11:34.791
<i>and understand everything that was inside of it.</i>

11:35.326 --> 11:37.127
<i>And just to give you some context,</i>

11:37.129 --> 11:39.162
we can go through and understand every line of code

11:39.164 --> 11:40.964
for the average threat in minutes.

11:41.566 --> 11:43.366
And here we are one month into this threat

11:43.368 --> 11:45.302
and we were just starting to discover what we call

11:45.304 --> 11:47.204
the payload or its whole purpose.

11:49.540 --> 11:51.074
<i>When looking at the STUXnet code,</i>

11:51.076 --> 11:53.643
<i>it's 20 times the size of the average piece of code</i>

11:54.145 --> 11:56.379
<i>but contains almost no bugs inside of it.</i>

11:56.381 --> 11:58.248
<i>And that's extremely rare.</i>

11:58.250 --> 12:00.150
<i>Malicious code always has bugs inside of it.</i>

12:00.152 --> 12:01.918
<i>This wasn't the case with STUXnet.</i>

12:01.920 --> 12:04.754
<i>It's dense and every piece of code does something</i>

12:04.756 --> 12:07.591
<i>and does something right in order to conduct its attack.</i>

12:08.826 --> 12:10.894
<i>One of the things that surprised us</i>

12:10.896 --> 12:13.263
<i>was that STUXnet utilized what's called</i>

12:13.265 --> 12:15.832
a zero-day exploit, or basically,

12:15.834 --> 12:18.168
a piece of code that allows it to spread

12:18.170 --> 12:20.003
without you having to do anything.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.739
You don't have to, for example, download a file and run it.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.941
A zero-day exploit is an exploit that

12:24.943 --> 12:26.610
nobody knows about except the attacker.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.178
So there's no protection against it.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.613
There's been no patch released.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.915
There's been zero days protection,

12:31.917 --> 12:33.516
you know, against it.

12:34.385 --> 12:35.785
<i>That's what attackers value,</i>

12:35.787 --> 12:37.587
<i>because they know 100 percent</i>

12:37.589 --> 12:39.923
<i>if they have this zero-day exploit,</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:41.625
<i>they can get in wherever they want.</i>

12:41.627 --> 12:43.126
<i>They're actually very valuable.</i>

12:43.128 --> 12:44.527
<i>You can sell these on the underground</i>

12:44.529 --> 12:46.049
<i>for hundreds of thousands of dollars.</i>

12:47.398 --> 12:48.465
Chien: <i>Then we became more worried</i>

12:48.467 --> 12:50.533
<i>because immediately we discovered more zero days.</i>

12:50.535 --> 12:53.270
And again, these zero days are extremely rare.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.572
Inside STUXnet we had, you know, four zero days,

12:55.574 --> 12:57.307
and for the entire rest of the year,

12:57.309 --> 12:59.876
we only saw 12 zero days used.

12:59.878 --> 13:01.544
It blows all... everything else out of the water.

13:01.546 --> 13:02.779
We've never seen this before.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.541
Actually, we've never seen it since, either.

13:04.615 --> 13:07.217
Seeing one in a malware you could understand

13:07.219 --> 13:10.120
because, you know, the malware authors are making money,

13:10.122 --> 13:11.721
they're stealing people's credit cards and making money,

13:11.723 --> 13:12.889
so it's worth their while to use it,

13:12.891 --> 13:15.258
but seeing four zero days, could be worth

13:15.260 --> 13:16.459
half a million dollars right there,

13:16.461 --> 13:18.228
used in one piece of malware,

13:18.496 --> 13:20.897
this is not your ordinary criminal gangs doing this.

13:20.899 --> 13:22.499
This is... this is someone bigger.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.401
It's definitely not traditional crime,

13:24.403 --> 13:27.904
not hacktivists. Who else?

13:28.773 --> 13:31.007
It was evident on a very early stage

13:31.509 --> 13:33.743
that just given the sophistication

13:33.745 --> 13:35.245
of this malware...

13:36.480 --> 13:39.282
Suggested that there must have been

13:39.284 --> 13:40.750
a nation-state involved,

13:40.752 --> 13:43.987
at least one nation-state involved in the development.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.022
When we look at code that's coming from

13:46.024 --> 13:47.590
what appears to be a state attacker

13:47.592 --> 13:50.193
or state-sponsored attacker, usually they're scrubbed clean.

13:50.195 --> 13:52.629
They don't... they don't leave little bits behind.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.364
They don't leave little hints behind.

13:54.632 --> 13:56.299
<i>But in STUXnet there were actually</i>

13:56.301 --> 13:57.667
<i>a few hints left behind.</i>

13:58.936 --> 14:02.205
<i>One was that, in order to get low-level access</i>

14:02.207 --> 14:03.673
<i>to Microsoft Windows,</i>

14:03.874 --> 14:05.674
<i>STUXnet needed to use a digital certificate,</i>

14:05.976 --> 14:08.378
<i>which certifies that this piece of code</i>

14:08.380 --> 14:11.247
<i>came from a particular company.</i>

14:12.149 --> 14:14.217
Now, those attackers obviously couldn't go to Microsoft

14:14.219 --> 14:15.685
and say, "hey, test our code out for us.

14:15.687 --> 14:17.287
And give us a digital certificate."

14:17.988 --> 14:19.589
So they essentially stole them...

14:20.825 --> 14:22.892
<i>From two companies in Taiwan.</i>

14:22.894 --> 14:24.794
<i>And these two companies have nothing to do with each other</i>

14:24.796 --> 14:26.463
<i>except for their close proximity</i>

14:26.465 --> 14:28.264
<i>in the exact same business park.</i>

14:30.835 --> 14:34.671
<i>Digital certificates are guarded very, very closely</i>

14:34.673 --> 14:36.206
<i>behind multiple doors</i>

14:36.208 --> 14:38.641
<i>and they require multiple people to unlock.</i>

14:38.643 --> 14:40.310
Security: <i> ...To the camera.</i>

14:40.312 --> 14:42.011
Chien: <i>And they need to provide both biometrics</i>

14:42.013 --> 14:44.414
<i>- and, as well, pass phrases.</i>

14:44.416 --> 14:45.882
<i>It wasn't like those certificates were</i>

14:45.884 --> 14:47.584
<i>just sitting on some machine connected to the Internet.</i>

14:47.818 --> 14:50.620
<i>Some human assets had to be involved, spies.</i>

14:50.855 --> 14:52.689
O'Murchu: <i>Like a cleaner who comes in at night</i>

14:52.691 --> 14:54.424
<i>and has stolen these certificates</i>

14:54.426 --> 14:55.658
<i>from these companies.</i>

14:59.063 --> 15:01.164
It did feel like walking onto the set

15:01.166 --> 15:03.666
of this James Bond movie and you...

15:03.668 --> 15:05.235
You've been embroiled in this thing that,

15:05.237 --> 15:07.837
you know, you... you never expected.

15:10.508 --> 15:11.608
<i>We continued to search,</i>

15:11.610 --> 15:13.109
<i>and we continued to search in code,</i>

15:13.111 --> 15:15.945
<i>and eventually we found some other bread crumbs left</i>

15:15.947 --> 15:17.347
<i>we were able to follow.</i>

15:18.048 --> 15:19.682
<i>It was doing something with Siemens,</i>

15:19.950 --> 15:22.752
<i>Siemens software, possibly Siemens hardware.</i>

15:23.053 --> 15:24.754
We'd never ever seen that in any malware before,

15:24.756 --> 15:26.089
something targeting Siemens.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.051
We didn't even know why they would be doing that.

15:29.627 --> 15:32.362
<i>But after googling, very quickly we understood</i>

15:32.364 --> 15:34.798
<i>it was targeting Siemens PLCs.</i>

15:35.266 --> 15:38.201
STUXnet was targeting a very specific hardware device,

15:38.203 --> 15:41.604
something called a PLC or a programmable logic controller.

15:42.039 --> 15:44.941
Langner: <i>The PLC is kind of a very small computer</i>

15:45.242 --> 15:47.977
attached to physical equipment,

15:47.979 --> 15:50.613
like pumps, like valves, like motors.

15:51.415 --> 15:55.985
<i>So this little box is running a digital program</i>

15:55.987 --> 15:58.288
<i>and the actions of this program</i>

15:58.290 --> 16:02.392
<i>turns that motor on, off, or sets a specific speed.</i>

16:02.394 --> 16:04.127
Chien: <i>Those program module controllers</i>

16:04.129 --> 16:06.663
<i>control things like power plants, power grids.</i>

16:06.665 --> 16:08.398
O'Murchu: <i>This is used in factories,</i>

16:08.400 --> 16:10.867
<i>it's used in critical infrastructure.</i>

16:11.569 --> 16:14.604
Critical infrastructure, it's everywhere around us,

16:14.606 --> 16:17.173
<i>transportation, telecommunications,</i>

16:17.175 --> 16:19.476
<i>financial services, health care.</i>

16:20.010 --> 16:22.912
<i>So the payload of STUXnet was designed</i>

16:22.914 --> 16:26.082
to attack some very important part

16:26.084 --> 16:27.517
of our world.

16:27.785 --> 16:29.319
The payload is gonna be important.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.088
What happens there could be very dangerous.

16:34.292 --> 16:37.260
Langner: <i>The next very big surprise came</i>

16:37.262 --> 16:39.562
<i>when it infected our lab system.</i>

16:40.297 --> 16:43.299
<i>We figured out that the malware was probing</i>

16:43.301 --> 16:44.667
<i>for controllers.</i>

16:45.035 --> 16:47.103
<i>It was quite picky on its targets.</i>

16:47.105 --> 16:51.441
<i>It didn't try to manipulate any given controller in a network</i>

16:51.443 --> 16:52.775
<i>that it would see.</i>

16:53.010 --> 16:57.213
<i>It went through several checks, and when those checks failed,</i>

16:57.215 --> 16:59.449
<i>it would not implement the attack.</i>

17:02.186 --> 17:06.055
<i>It was obviously probing for a specific target.</i>

17:07.391 --> 17:09.559
You've got to put this in context that,

17:09.560 --> 17:11.361
at the time, we already knew,

17:11.363 --> 17:13.730
well, this is the most sophisticated piece of malware

17:13.732 --> 17:15.298
that we have ever seen.

17:16.066 --> 17:18.034
So it's kind of strange.

17:18.036 --> 17:23.039
Somebody takes that huge effort to hit one specific target?

17:23.307 --> 17:25.241
Well, that must be quite a significant target.

17:28.846 --> 17:31.247
Chien: <i>So at Symantec we have probes on networks</i>

17:31.249 --> 17:32.415
<i>all over the world</i>

17:32.417 --> 17:34.817
<i>watching for malicious activity.</i>

17:35.219 --> 17:37.220
O'Murchu: <i>We'd actually seen infections of STUXnet</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:39.756
<i>all over the world, in the U.S., Australia,</i>

17:39.758 --> 17:42.392
<i>in the U.K., in France, Germany, all over Europe.</i>

17:42.893 --> 17:45.293
Chien: <i>It spread to any Windows machine in the entire world.</i>

17:45.663 --> 17:47.897
You know, we had these organizations

17:47.899 --> 17:50.199
inside the United States who were in charge of

17:50.201 --> 17:51.901
<i>industrial control facilities saying,</i>

17:51.903 --> 17:53.903
<i>"we're infected. What's gonna happen?"</i>

17:54.271 --> 17:56.940
O'Murchu: <i>We didn't know if there was a deadline coming up</i>

17:56.942 --> 17:58.508
<i>where this threat would trigger</i>

17:58.510 --> 18:00.843
<i>and suddenly would, like, turn off all, you know,</i>

18:00.845 --> 18:02.412
electricity plants around the world

18:02.414 --> 18:04.180
or it would start shutting things down

18:04.182 --> 18:05.515
or launching some attack.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.385
<i>We knew that STUXnet could have very dire consequences,</i>

18:09.387 --> 18:12.055
<i>and we were very worried about</i>

18:12.057 --> 18:13.523
<i>what the payload contained</i>

18:13.525 --> 18:15.758
<i>and there was an imperative speed</i>

18:15.760 --> 18:17.860
<i>that we had to race and try and, you know,</i>

18:17.862 --> 18:19.262
<i>beat this ticking bomb.</i>

18:20.397 --> 18:22.932
<i>Eventually, we were able to refine the statistics a little</i>

18:22.934 --> 18:24.434
<i>and we saw that Iran was the number one</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:26.035
<i>infected country in the world.</i>

18:26.037 --> 18:28.605
Chien: <i>That immediately raised our eyebrows.</i>

18:28.607 --> 18:30.873
We had never seen a threat before

18:30.875 --> 18:33.009
where it was predominantly in Iran.

18:33.944 --> 18:35.545
<i>And so we began to follow what was going on</i>

18:35.547 --> 18:36.779
<i>in the geopolitical world,</i>

18:36.947 --> 18:38.547
<i>what was happening in the general news.</i>

18:38.716 --> 18:41.951
<i>And at that time, there were actually multiple explosions</i>

18:41.953 --> 18:44.854
<i>of gas pipelines going in and out of Iran.</i>

18:45.823 --> 18:47.223
<i>Unexplained explosions.</i>

18:48.759 --> 18:50.893
O'Murchu: <i>And of course, we did notice that at the time</i>

18:50.895 --> 18:53.529
<i>there had been assassinations of nuclear scientists.</i>

18:54.732 --> 18:56.165
<i>So that was worrying.</i>

18:56.967 --> 18:59.168
<i>We knew there was something bad happening.</i>

18:59.637 --> 19:01.471
Gibney: Did you get concerned for yourself?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.406
I mean, did you begin to start looking over your shoulder

19:03.408 --> 19:04.641
from time to time?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.242
Yeah, definitely looking over my shoulder

19:06.244 --> 19:08.811
and... and being careful about what I spoke about on the phone.

19:09.813 --> 19:13.016
I was... pretty confident my conversations on my...

19:13.018 --> 19:14.484
On the phone were being listened to.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.786
We were only half joking

19:16.788 --> 19:18.821
when we would look at each other

19:18.823 --> 19:20.590
and tell each other things like,

19:20.592 --> 19:22.825
"look, I'm not suicidal.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.663
If I show up dead on Monday, you know, it wasn't me."

19:35.439 --> 19:37.874
<i>We'd been publishing information about STUXnet</i>

19:37.876 --> 19:39.275
<i>all through that summer.</i>

19:40.644 --> 19:43.279
<i>And then in November, the industrial control system</i>

19:43.281 --> 19:46.416
<i>sort of expert in Holland contacted us...</i>

19:47.685 --> 19:50.286
<i>And he said all of these devices that would be inside of</i>

19:50.288 --> 19:53.356
<i>an industrial control system hold a unique identifier number</i>

19:53.358 --> 19:56.559
that identified the make and model of that device.

19:58.328 --> 20:01.998
<i>And we actually had a couple of these numbers in the code</i>

20:02.000 --> 20:03.440
<i>that we didn't know what they were.</i>

20:04.401 --> 20:06.302
And so we realized maybe what he was referring to

20:06.304 --> 20:07.770
was the magic numbers we had.

20:08.305 --> 20:09.839
And then when we searched for those magic numbers

20:09.841 --> 20:11.007
in that context,

20:11.009 --> 20:13.409
<i>we saw that what had to be connected</i>

20:13.411 --> 20:15.578
<i>to this industrial control system that was being targeted</i>

20:15.580 --> 20:17.547
<i>were something called frequency converters</i>

20:17.881 --> 20:20.049
<i>from two specific manufacturers,</i>

20:20.051 --> 20:21.818
<i>one of which was in Iran.</i>

20:22.419 --> 20:24.187
And so at this time, we absolutely knew

20:24.189 --> 20:26.522
that the facility that was being targeted

20:26.524 --> 20:27.990
had to be in Iran

20:28.325 --> 20:31.160
and had equipment made from Iranian manufacturers.

20:32.096 --> 20:33.863
When we looked up those frequency converters,

20:33.865 --> 20:35.665
<i>we immediately found out that they were actually</i>

20:35.667 --> 20:38.067
<i>export controlled by the nuclear regulatory commission.</i>

20:38.669 --> 20:40.002
<i>And that immediately lead us then</i>

20:40.004 --> 20:42.271
to some nuclear facility.

20:59.890 --> 21:02.024
Gibney: <i>This was more than a computer story,</i>

21:02.392 --> 21:04.827
<i>so I left the world of the antivirus detectives</i>

21:05.129 --> 21:07.063
<i>and sought out journalist, David Sanger,</i>

21:07.065 --> 21:09.298
<i>who specialized in the strange intersection</i>

21:09.300 --> 21:12.301
<i>of cyber, nuclear weapons, and espionage.</i>

21:13.270 --> 21:15.371
Sanger: <i>The emergence of the code</i>

21:15.373 --> 21:18.674
<i>is what put me on alert that an attack was under way.</i>

21:20.110 --> 21:23.279
<i>And because of the covert nature of the operation,</i>

21:23.281 --> 21:26.282
<i>not only were official government spokesmen</i>

21:26.284 --> 21:29.185
<i>unable to talk about it, they didn't even know about it.</i>

21:30.387 --> 21:32.455
<i>Eventually, the more I dug into it,</i>

21:32.457 --> 21:37.059
the more I began to find individuals

21:37.294 --> 21:39.495
who had been involved in some piece of it

21:39.663 --> 21:41.731
or who had witnessed some piece of it.

21:42.332 --> 21:44.734
And that meant talking to Americans,

21:44.736 --> 21:47.637
talking to Israelis, talking to Europeans,

21:47.639 --> 21:50.740
because this was obviously the first, biggest,

21:50.742 --> 21:55.311
and most sophisticated example of a state

21:55.313 --> 21:57.947
or two states using a cyber weapon

21:57.949 --> 21:59.482
for offensive purposes.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.822
<i>I came to this with a fair bit of history,</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:08.591
<i>understanding the Iranian nuclear program.</i>

22:09.626 --> 22:13.029
<i>How did Iran get its first nuclear reactor?</i>

22:13.597 --> 22:16.732
We gave it to them... under the Shah,

22:17.034 --> 22:20.469
<i>because the Shah was considered an American ally.</i>

22:21.973 --> 22:25.608
<i>Thank you again for your warm welcome, Mr. President.</i>

22:25.943 --> 22:27.543
Gary Samore: <i>During the Nixon administration,</i>

22:27.545 --> 22:30.813
<i>the U.S. was very enthusiastic about supporting</i>

22:30.815 --> 22:32.915
<i>the Shah's nuclear power program.</i>

22:33.817 --> 22:36.152
And at one point, the Nixon administration

22:36.154 --> 22:38.988
was pushing the idea that Pakistan and Iran

22:38.990 --> 22:43.593
should build a joint plant together in Iran.

22:44.962 --> 22:46.662
<i>There's at least some evidence that</i>

22:46.664 --> 22:50.166
<i>the Shah was thinking about acquisition of nuclear weapons,</i>

22:50.168 --> 22:53.703
<i>because he saw, and we were encouraging him to see Iran</i>

22:53.705 --> 22:56.005
<i>as the so-called policemen of the Persian Gulf.</i>

22:56.007 --> 22:58.174
<i>And the Iranians have always viewed themselves</i>

22:58.176 --> 23:01.410
<i>as naturally the dominant power in the Middle East.</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:07.594
Why is it normal for you,
the Germans and the British,

23:07.845 --> 23:09.435
to have...

23:10.764 --> 23:14.484
atomic and hydrogen weapons, and for Iran,

23:15.102 --> 23:17.102
the simple principle of self-defense

23:17.396 --> 23:20.106
the defense of its interests, a problem,

23:20.357 --> 23:22.357
while for others it is totally normal?

23:24.001 --> 23:25.568
Samore: <i> But the revolution,</i>

23:25.570 --> 23:27.270
<i>which overthrew the Shah in '79,</i>

23:27.272 --> 23:29.071
<i>really curtailed the program</i>

23:29.073 --> 23:31.440
<i>before it ever got any head of steam going.</i>

23:32.542 --> 23:37.113
<i>Part of our policy against Iran after the revolution</i>

23:37.115 --> 23:39.415
was to deny them nuclear technology.

23:39.417 --> 23:42.718
So most of the period when I was involved

23:42.720 --> 23:44.720
in the '80s and the '90s

23:44.722 --> 23:47.123
was the U.S. running around the world

23:47.125 --> 23:50.393
and persuading potential nuclear suppliers

23:50.395 --> 23:53.796
not to provide even peaceful nuclear technology to Iran.

23:54.031 --> 23:57.466
And what we missed was the clandestine transfer

23:57.468 --> 24:00.369
in the mid-1980s from Pakistan to Iran.

24:04.375 --> 24:05.608
Rolf Mowatt-Larssen: <i>Abdul Qadeer Khan</i>

24:05.610 --> 24:06.943
<i>is what we would call</i>

24:06.945 --> 24:08.945
<i>the father of the Pakistan nuclear program.</i>

24:10.380 --> 24:12.949
<i>He had the full authority and confidence</i>

24:12.951 --> 24:15.251
<i>of the Pakistan government from its inception</i>

24:15.253 --> 24:17.320
<i>to the production of nuclear weapons.</i>

24:19.056 --> 24:21.390
I was a CIA officer for... for...

24:21.392 --> 24:24.060
For over two decades, operations officer,

24:24.062 --> 24:25.861
worked overseas most of my career.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.497
The A.Q. Khan network is so notable

24:28.499 --> 24:31.500
because aside from building

24:31.502 --> 24:34.537
the Pakistani program for decades...

24:35.772 --> 24:38.941
It also was the means by which other countries

24:38.943 --> 24:41.577
<i>were able to develop nuclear weapons,</i>

24:41.579 --> 24:42.878
<i>including Iran.</i>

24:43.480 --> 24:45.114
Samore: <i>A.Q. Khan acting on behalf</i>

24:45.116 --> 24:46.182
<i>of the Pakistani government</i>

24:46.184 --> 24:49.285
negotiated with officials in Iran

24:49.287 --> 24:52.321
and then there was a transfer which took place

24:52.323 --> 24:53.389
through Dubai

24:53.391 --> 24:56.625
<i>of blueprints for nuclear weapons design</i>

24:56.627 --> 24:58.227
<i>as well as some hardware.</i>

24:59.363 --> 25:01.364
<i>Throughout the mid-1980s,</i>

25:01.366 --> 25:04.433
<i>the Iranian program was not very well-resourced.</i>

25:04.435 --> 25:06.268
<i>It was more of an R & D program.</i>

25:07.304 --> 25:10.506
<i>It wasn't really until the mid-'90s</i>

25:10.508 --> 25:12.775
<i>that it started to take off when they made the decision</i>

25:12.777 --> 25:14.844
<i>to build the nuclear weapons program.</i>

25:21.518 --> 25:23.019
<i>You know, we can speculate what,</i>

25:23.021 --> 25:24.453
in their mind, motivated them.

25:24.455 --> 25:27.623
I think it was the U.S. invasion of Iraq

25:27.625 --> 25:29.225
after Kuwait.

25:30.527 --> 25:31.994
<i>You know, there was an eight-year war</i>

25:31.996 --> 25:33.562
<i>between Iraq and Iran,</i>

25:33.830 --> 25:37.233
<i>we had wiped out Saddam's forces in a matter of weeks.</i>

25:40.138 --> 25:42.872
<i>And I think that was enough to convince the rulers</i>

25:42.874 --> 25:45.041
<i>in Tehran that they needed to pursue</i>

25:45.043 --> 25:46.609
<i>nuclear weapons more seriously.</i>

25:48.645 --> 25:51.547
George Bush: States like these and their terrorist allies

25:51.549 --> 25:54.383
constitute an axis of evil,

25:54.385 --> 25:57.153
arming to threaten the peace of the world.

25:58.555 --> 26:01.190
Samore: <i> From 2003 to 2005</i>

26:01.192 --> 26:04.493
<i>when they feared that the U.S. would invade them,</i>

26:04.495 --> 26:06.829
<i>they accepted limits on their nuclear program.</i>

26:07.264 --> 26:10.900
<i>But by 2006, the Iranians had come to the conclusion</i>

26:10.902 --> 26:13.769
<i>that the U.S. was bogged down in Afghanistan and Iraq</i>

26:13.771 --> 26:16.972
<i>and no longer had the capacity to threaten them,</i>

26:17.340 --> 26:21.077
<i>and so they felt it was safe to resume their enrichment program</i>

26:21.845 --> 26:24.513
<i>they started producing low enriched uranium,</i>

26:24.781 --> 26:26.782
<i>producing more centrifuges, installing them</i>

26:26.784 --> 26:30.619
<i>at the large-scale underground enrichment facility at Natanz.</i>

26:41.965 --> 26:44.414
Journalist:

26:44.414 --> 26:46.809
For a journalist, passing through
these underground tunnels

26:47.022 --> 26:50.982
and visiting the beating heart of
Iran's nuclear plant is quite an event.

26:51.193 --> 26:56.873
The president's visit to the plant today
had made this event possible for us.

26:57.825 --> 27:00.017
The West tells us that we have to
negotiate with them for like ten years

27:00.017 --> 27:02.051
Ahmadinejad:

27:02.371 --> 27:06.461
and then they will decide whether Iran
may have 20 centrifuges or not.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.669
Of course the Iranian nation
says no to them.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.003
Today, about 7,000 of these machines

27:11.296 --> 27:14.756
are working under
the ground right over there.

27:35.085 --> 27:37.019
Gibney: How many times have you been to Natanz?

27:37.354 --> 27:40.756
Not that many, because I left few years ago, the CIA,

27:40.758 --> 27:43.092
but I was there quite... quite a few times.

27:46.630 --> 27:49.198
<i>Natanz is just in the middle of the desert.</i>

27:51.134 --> 27:53.102
<i>When they were building it in secret,</i>

27:53.336 --> 27:57.373
<i>they were calling it desert irrigation facility.</i>

27:57.874 --> 27:59.441
For the local people,

27:59.443 --> 28:02.011
you want to sell why you are building a big complex.

28:04.814 --> 28:07.516
<i>There is a lot of artillery and air force.</i>

28:07.518 --> 28:11.921
<i>It's better protected against attack from air</i>

28:12.455 --> 28:14.957
<i>than any other nuclear installation I have seen.</i>

28:17.727 --> 28:20.196
<i>So this is deeply underground.</i>

28:24.801 --> 28:28.704
But then inside, Natanz is like any other centrifuge facility.

28:28.706 --> 28:33.042
I have been all over the world, from Brazil to Russia, Japan,

28:33.044 --> 28:37.580
so they are all alike with their own features,

28:37.582 --> 28:39.982
their own centrifuges, their own culture,

28:39.984 --> 28:42.585
but basically, the process is the same.

28:43.653 --> 28:46.722
<i>And so are the monitoring activities of the IAEA.</i>

28:46.724 --> 28:48.390
<i>There are basic principles.</i>

28:48.392 --> 28:51.126
<i>You want to see what goes in, what goes out,</i>

28:51.394 --> 28:53.562
<i>and then on top of that you make sure that</i>

28:53.564 --> 28:56.031
<i>it produces low enriched uranium</i>

28:56.033 --> 28:58.434
<i>instead of anything to do with the higher enrichments</i>

28:58.436 --> 29:00.603
<i>and nuclear weapon grade uranium.</i>

29:06.576 --> 29:07.943
Emad Kiyaei: <i>Iran's nuclear facilities</i>

29:07.945 --> 29:10.179
<i>are under 24-hour watch.</i>

29:10.880 --> 29:13.215
<i>Of the United Nations nuclear watchdog,</i>

29:13.217 --> 29:16.518
<i>the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency.</i>

29:17.887 --> 29:22.091
Every single gram of Iranian fissile material...

29:23.293 --> 29:24.660
Is accounted for.

29:27.464 --> 29:29.932
<i>They have, like, basically seals they put</i>

29:29.934 --> 29:33.502
<i>on fissile materials. There are IAEA seals.</i>

29:33.737 --> 29:36.038
You can't break it

29:36.040 --> 29:37.873
without getting noticed.

29:39.876 --> 29:42.111
Heinonen: <i>When you look at the uranium</i>

29:42.113 --> 29:45.981
<i>which was there in Natanz, it was a very special uranium.</i>

29:46.149 --> 29:51.553
This is called Isotope 236, and that was a puzzle to us,

29:51.555 --> 29:53.989
because you only see this sort of uranium

29:53.991 --> 29:57.126
in states which have had nuclear weapons.

29:58.995 --> 30:01.697
<i>We realized that they had cheated us.</i>

30:02.399 --> 30:05.668
<i>This sort of equipment has been bought</i>

30:05.670 --> 30:07.469
from what they call a black market.

30:07.471 --> 30:10.706
They never pointed out it to A.Q. Khan

30:11.141 --> 30:12.941
at that point of time.

30:17.814 --> 30:21.150
<i>What I was surprised was the sophistication</i>

30:21.152 --> 30:22.985
<i>and the quality control</i>

30:23.286 --> 30:25.287
<i>and the way they have the manufacturing</i>

30:25.289 --> 30:26.689
<i>was really professional.</i>

30:27.824 --> 30:30.426
It was not something, you know, you just create

30:30.428 --> 30:31.960
in a few months' time.

30:31.962 --> 30:34.697
This was a result of a long process.

30:41.805 --> 30:44.606
<i>A centrifuge, you feed uranium gas</i>

30:44.608 --> 30:47.710
<i>in and you have a cascade, thousands of centrifuges,</i>

30:47.712 --> 30:50.713
<i>and from the other end you get enriched uranium out.</i>

30:51.448 --> 30:55.451
<i>It separates uranium based on spinning the rotors.</i>

30:55.453 --> 30:59.221
<i>It spins so fast, 300 meters per second,</i>

30:59.223 --> 31:02.257
<i>the same as the velocity of sound.</i>

31:03.626 --> 31:05.294
<i>These are tremendous forces</i>

31:05.296 --> 31:08.230
<i>and as a result, the rotor, it twists,</i>

31:08.232 --> 31:10.399
<i>looks like a banana at one point of time.</i>

31:11.801 --> 31:13.369
So it has to be balanced

31:13.371 --> 31:16.739
because any small vibration it will blow up.

31:18.141 --> 31:20.075
<i>And here comes another trouble.</i>

31:20.377 --> 31:22.544
<i>You have to raise the temperature</i>

31:22.546 --> 31:25.647
<i>but this very thin rotor was...</i>

31:25.649 --> 31:27.683
<i>They are made from carbon fiber,</i>

31:27.685 --> 31:30.319
<i>and the other pieces, they are made from metal.</i>

31:31.221 --> 31:34.723
When you heat carbon fiber, it shrinks.

31:35.825 --> 31:38.127
When you heat metal, it expands.

31:38.495 --> 31:41.530
So you need to balance not only that they spin,

31:41.532 --> 31:44.666
they twist, but this temperature behavior

31:44.668 --> 31:46.902
<i>in such a way that it doesn't break.</i>

31:46.904 --> 31:49.104
<i>So this has to be very precise.</i>

31:49.606 --> 31:52.074
<i>This is what makes them very difficult to manufacture.</i>

31:52.076 --> 31:54.743
You can model it, you can calculate it,

31:54.745 --> 31:57.212
but at the very end, it's actually based

31:57.214 --> 31:59.848
on practice and experience.

31:59.850 --> 32:03.152
So it's a... it's a piece of art, so to say.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.454
Man:

32:16.454 --> 32:19.690
Because of the strength of our nation,
our army and our revolutionary guard

32:20.939 --> 32:26.569
Our dawn became eternal
by the glow of success

32:28.113 --> 32:31.993
Morning of dreams rises from the shores

32:32.242 --> 32:36.162
The branches of life have sprouted

32:36.497 --> 32:42.127
May this victory be Blessed

32:44.093 --> 32:46.428
Heinonen: <i>Iranians are very proud of their centrifuges.</i>

32:46.430 --> 32:49.398
<i>They have a lot of public relations videos</i>

32:49.400 --> 32:53.135
<i>given up always in April when they have what they call</i>

32:53.137 --> 32:54.636
<i>a national nuclear day.</i>

32:55.057 --> 32:57.347
Blessed be this holy spring

32:57.347 --> 32:59.141
Man:

32:59.311 --> 33:02.151
Blessed be the gardener

33:02.439 --> 33:05.069
I proudly announce that from today on,

33:05.442 --> 33:08.952
Iran is among the countries
that can produce nuclear fuel.

33:08.953 --> 33:12.321
Kiyaei: <i>Ahmadinejad came into his presidency saying</i>

33:12.323 --> 33:14.923
if the international community wants to derail us

33:14.925 --> 33:16.592
we will stand up to it.

33:17.660 --> 33:20.362
If they want us to sign more inspections

33:20.364 --> 33:23.632
and more additional protocols and other measures,

33:23.634 --> 33:26.368
no, we will not. We will fight for our rights.

33:27.605 --> 33:30.672
<i>Iran is a signature to nuclear non-proliferation treaty,</i>

33:30.674 --> 33:34.276
<i>and under that treaty, Iran has a right to a nuclear program.</i>

33:34.844 --> 33:38.313
<i>We can have enrichment. Who are you, world powers,</i>

33:38.315 --> 33:40.782
<i>to come and tell us that we cannot have enrichment?</i>

33:41.150 --> 33:42.885
This was his mantra,

33:43.620 --> 33:46.989
and it galvanized the public.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.961
Sanger: <i> By 2007, 2008,</i>

33:52.963 --> 33:55.464
<i>the U.S. government was in a very bad place with</i>

33:55.466 --> 33:56.765
<i>the Iranian program.</i>

33:57.734 --> 33:59.835
<i>President Bush recognized</i>

33:59.837 --> 34:02.471
<i>that he could not even come out in public</i>

34:02.473 --> 34:04.973
<i>and declare that the Iranians were building a nuclear weapon,</i>

34:04.975 --> 34:06.808
<i>because by this time, he had gone through</i>

34:06.810 --> 34:10.112
<i>the entire WMD fiasco in Iraq.</i>

34:10.813 --> 34:13.081
He could not really take military action.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.484
<i>Condoleezza Rice said to him at one point,</i>

34:15.485 --> 34:18.887
<i>"you know, Mr. President, I think you've invaded</i>

34:18.889 --> 34:22.558
<i>your last Muslim country, even for the best of reasons."</i>

34:24.393 --> 34:26.594
<i>He didn't want to let the Israelis</i>

34:26.597 --> 34:28.429
<i>conduct a military operation.</i>

34:28.764 --> 34:34.503
It's 1938, and Iran is Germany and it's racing...

34:35.338 --> 34:37.940
To arm itself with atomic bombs.

34:38.541 --> 34:42.110
Iran's nuclear ambitions must be stopped.

34:42.779 --> 34:47.516
They have to be stopped. We all have to stop it, now.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.118
That's the one message I have for you today.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.020
- Thank you.

34:52.022 --> 34:54.889
Israel was saying they were gonna bomb Iran.

34:54.891 --> 34:58.093
And the government here in Washington

34:58.095 --> 35:00.462
did all sorts of scenarios about what would happen

35:00.464 --> 35:03.031
if that Israeli attack occurred.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.601
They were all very ugly scenarios.

35:05.603 --> 35:08.604
Our belief was that if they went on their own

35:08.606 --> 35:10.405
knowing the limitations...

35:10.407 --> 35:12.307
No, they're a very good air force, all right?

35:12.642 --> 35:14.710
But it's small and the distances are great

35:14.712 --> 35:17.112
and the target's disbursed and hardened, all right?

35:18.114 --> 35:20.682
If they would have attempted a raid

35:21.384 --> 35:23.118
on a military plane,

35:23.419 --> 35:26.221
we would have been assuming that they were assuming

35:26.223 --> 35:28.790
we would finish that which they started.

35:28.792 --> 35:31.426
In other words, there would be many of us

35:31.428 --> 35:33.462
in government thinking that the purpose of the raid

35:33.464 --> 35:35.998
wasn't to destroy the Iranian nuclear system,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.668
but the purpose of the raid was to put us at war with Iran.

35:40.603 --> 35:42.638
Israel is very much concerned about

35:42.640 --> 35:45.307
Iran's nuclear program, more than the United States.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.076
It's only natural because of the size of the country,

35:48.078 --> 35:50.479
because we live in this neighborhood,

35:50.481 --> 35:54.116
America lives thousands and thousands miles away from Iran.

35:54.118 --> 35:57.753
The two countries agreed on the goal.

35:58.021 --> 36:00.789
There is no page between us

36:00.791 --> 36:06.128
that Iran should not have a nuclear military capability.

36:06.130 --> 36:08.130
There are some differences

36:08.132 --> 36:10.499
on how to... how to achieve it

36:10.501 --> 36:12.801
and when action is needed.

36:15.424 --> 36:21.054
The origin of corruption (Israel)
will be wiped off the face of the Earth.

36:22.311 --> 36:24.713
Yadlin: <i>We are taking very seriously</i>

36:24.715 --> 36:27.449
leaders of countries who call to the destruction

36:27.451 --> 36:30.085
and annihilation of our people.

36:30.286 --> 36:32.788
If Iran will get nuclear weapons,

36:32.790 --> 36:34.256
now or in the future...

36:35.224 --> 36:38.060
It means that for the first time in human history

36:38.861 --> 36:41.563
Islamic zealots, religious zealots,

36:42.231 --> 36:44.566
will get their hand on

36:44.568 --> 36:47.536
the most dangerous, devastating weapons,

36:47.538 --> 36:50.305
and the world should prevent this.

36:52.475 --> 36:56.244
Samore: <i>The Israelis believe that the Iranian leadership</i>

36:56.246 --> 36:59.181
<i>has already made the decision to build nuclear weapons</i>

36:59.183 --> 37:01.083
<i>when they think they can get away with it.</i>

37:01.484 --> 37:04.252
<i>The view in the U.S. is that the Iranians</i>

37:04.254 --> 37:06.421
<i>haven't made that final decision yet.</i>

37:07.390 --> 37:09.324
To me, that doesn't make any difference.

37:09.326 --> 37:11.059
I mean, it really doesn't make any difference,

37:11.061 --> 37:14.229
and it's probably unknowable, unless you can put, you know,

37:14.231 --> 37:17.599
Supreme Leader Khamenei on the couch and interview him.

37:17.601 --> 37:20.535
<i>I think, you know, from our standpoint,</i>

37:20.537 --> 37:23.171
<i>stopping Iran from getting the threshold capacity</i>

37:23.173 --> 37:26.308
<i>is, you know, the primary policy objective.</i>

37:27.610 --> 37:29.711
<i>Once they have the fissile material,</i>

37:29.713 --> 37:32.114
<i>once they have the capacity to produce nuclear weapons,</i>

37:32.116 --> 37:33.482
<i>then the game is lost.</i>

37:39.288 --> 37:41.089
Hayden: <i>President Bush once said to me, he said,</i>

37:41.091 --> 37:44.192
<i>"Mike, I don't want any president ever to be faced</i>

37:44.194 --> 37:48.230
with only two options, bombing or the bomb."

37:48.232 --> 37:49.464
Right?

37:49.466 --> 37:53.034
He... he wanted options that... that made it...

37:53.236 --> 37:56.204
Made it far less likely he or his successor

37:56.206 --> 37:58.740
or successors would ever get to that point

37:58.742 --> 38:00.375
where that's... that's all you've got.

38:00.710 --> 38:04.346
We wanted to be energetic enough in pursuing this problem

38:04.714 --> 38:07.716
that... that the Israelis would certainly believe,

38:07.718 --> 38:08.917
"yeah, we get it."

38:08.919 --> 38:11.052
The intelligence cooperation between Israel

38:11.054 --> 38:14.489
and the United States is very, very good.

38:15.258 --> 38:17.559
<i>And therefore, the Israelis went to the Americans</i>

38:17.561 --> 38:21.163
<i>and said, "okay, guys, you don't want us to bomb Iran.</i>

38:21.165 --> 38:24.332
<i>Okay, let's do it differently."</i>

38:24.834 --> 38:28.403
<i>And then the American intelligence community started</i>

38:28.405 --> 38:30.105
<i>rolling in joint forces</i>

38:30.107 --> 38:32.073
<i>with the Israeli intelligence community.</i>

38:32.742 --> 38:36.745
One day a group of intelligence and military officials showed up

38:37.446 --> 38:39.381
in President Bush's office

38:39.982 --> 38:41.516
and said, "sir, we have an idea.

38:42.652 --> 38:43.985
It's a big risk.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.321
It might not work, but here it is."

38:53.863 --> 38:57.499
Langner: <i>Moving forward in my analysis of the codes,</i>

38:57.501 --> 39:01.536
<i>I took a closer look at the photographs</i>

39:01.538 --> 39:03.371
<i>that had been published</i>

39:03.373 --> 39:08.143
by the Iranians themselves in a press tour from 2008

39:08.145 --> 39:11.279
<i>of Ahmadinejad and the shiny centrifuges.</i>

39:13.683 --> 39:15.550
Sanger: <i>Well, photographs of Ahmadinejad</i>

39:15.552 --> 39:18.353
<i>going through the centrifuges at Natanz</i>

39:18.355 --> 39:21.790
<i>had provided some very important clues.</i>

39:22.491 --> 39:24.693
There was a huge amount to be learned.

39:33.002 --> 39:35.804
<i>First of all, those photographs showed</i>

39:35.806 --> 39:39.140
<i>many of the individuals who were guiding Ahmadinejad</i>

39:39.142 --> 39:40.308
<i>through the program.</i>

39:40.310 --> 39:42.911
<i>And there's one very famous photograph that shows</i>

39:42.913 --> 39:44.913
<i>Ahmadinejad being shown something.</i>

39:44.915 --> 39:47.482
<i>You see his face, you can't see what's on the computer.</i>

39:47.484 --> 39:50.919
<i>And one of the scientists who was behind him</i>

39:50.921 --> 39:53.321
<i>was assassinated a few months later.</i>

39:57.693 --> 39:59.427
Langner: <i>In one of those photographs,</i>

39:59.695 --> 40:03.031
you could see parts of a computer screen.

40:03.033 --> 40:05.600
We... we refer to that as a SCADA screen.

40:05.602 --> 40:08.570
<i>The SCADA system is basically a piece of software</i>

40:08.572 --> 40:10.171
<i>running on a computer.</i>

40:10.173 --> 40:13.775
<i>It enables the operators to monitor the processes.</i>

40:14.777 --> 40:18.914
What you could see when you look close enough

40:19.448 --> 40:23.785
<i>was a more detailed view of the configuration</i>

40:24.587 --> 40:27.889
<i>there were these six groups of centrifuges</i>

40:27.891 --> 40:31.326
<i>and each group had 164 entries.</i>

40:31.894 --> 40:33.461
And guess what?

40:33.763 --> 40:36.097
That was a perfect match to what we saw

40:36.099 --> 40:37.465
in the attack code.

40:38.801 --> 40:42.203
<i>It was absolutely clear that this piece of code</i>

40:42.205 --> 40:45.774
<i>was attacking an array of six different groups</i>

40:45.776 --> 40:49.611
<i>of, let's just say, thingies, physical objects,</i>

40:49.613 --> 40:55.517
<i>and in those six groups, there were 164 elements.</i>

40:59.221 --> 41:01.556
Gibney: Were you able to do any actual physical tests?

41:01.558 --> 41:03.792
Or it was all just code analysis?

41:03.794 --> 41:05.727
Yeah, so, you know, we obviously

41:05.729 --> 41:08.797
couldn't set up our own sort of nuclear enrichment facility.

41:08.965 --> 41:11.266
So... but what we did was we did obtain some PLCs,

41:11.268 --> 41:12.500
the exact models.

41:19.675 --> 41:22.077
<i>We then ordered an air pump, and that's what we used</i>

41:22.079 --> 41:23.745
<i>sort of as our sort of proof of concept.</i>

41:24.580 --> 41:26.314
O'Murchu: <i>We needed a visual demonstration</i>

41:26.316 --> 41:28.516
<i>to show people what we discovered.</i>

41:28.818 --> 41:30.852
So we thought of different things that we could do,

41:30.854 --> 41:32.988
and we... we settled on blowing up a balloon.

41:37.326 --> 41:39.294
<i>We were able to write a program that would inflate a balloon,</i>

41:39.296 --> 41:42.197
<i>and it was set to stop after five seconds.</i>

41:52.174 --> 41:53.942
<i>So it would inflate the balloon to a certain size</i>

41:53.944 --> 41:55.443
<i>but it wouldn't burst the balloon</i>

41:55.445 --> 41:56.878
<i>and it was all safe.</i>

41:56.880 --> 41:58.980
And we showed everybody, this is the code

41:58.982 --> 42:00.215
that's on the PLC.

42:00.649 --> 42:02.617
<i>And the timer says, "stop after five seconds."</i>

42:02.852 --> 42:04.412
<i>We know that's what's going to happen.</i>

42:04.987 --> 42:07.255
And then we would infect the computer with STUXnet,

42:07.790 --> 42:10.058
<i>and we would run the test again.</i>

42:41.257 --> 42:42.857
Here is a piece of software

42:42.859 --> 42:45.827
that should only exist in a cyber realm

42:45.829 --> 42:48.930
and it is able to affect physical equipment

42:48.932 --> 42:52.667
in a plant or factory and cause physical damage.

42:52.669 --> 42:54.736
Real-world physical destruction.

42:59.241 --> 43:01.910
<i>At that time, things became very scary to us.</i>

43:01.912 --> 43:04.412
<i>Here you had malware potentially killing people</i>

43:04.414 --> 43:06.714
and that was something that was always Hollywood-esque to us

43:06.716 --> 43:07.882
that we'd always laugh at

43:07.884 --> 43:09.918
when people made that kind of assertion.

43:15.524 --> 43:18.026
Gibney: <i>At this point, you had to have started developing</i>

43:18.028 --> 43:20.795
<i>theories as to who had built STUXnet.</i>

43:21.730 --> 43:23.298
It wasn't lost on us that

43:23.300 --> 43:26.534
there were probably only a few countries

43:26.536 --> 43:28.870
in the world that would want

43:28.872 --> 43:31.739
and have the motivation to sabotage

43:31.741 --> 43:33.875
Iran's nuclear enrichment facility.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.777
The U.S. government would be up there.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.946
Israeli government certainly would be... would be up there.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.048
You know, maybe U.K., France, Germany,

43:40.050 --> 43:41.483
those sorts of countries,

43:41.485 --> 43:43.785
but we never found any information that

43:43.787 --> 43:46.821
would tie it back 100 percent to... to those countries.

43:46.823 --> 43:48.756
There are no telltale signs.

43:48.758 --> 43:51.326
You know, the attackers don't leave a message inside

43:51.328 --> 43:53.495
saying, you know, "it was me."

43:54.396 --> 43:57.665
And even if they did, all of that stuff can be faked.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.668
So it's very, very difficult to do attribution

44:00.670 --> 44:02.403
when looking at computer code.

44:03.272 --> 44:04.806
Gibney: Subsequent work that's been done

44:04.808 --> 44:07.242
leads us to believe that this was the work of

44:07.244 --> 44:08.776
a collaboration between Israel and the United States.

44:08.778 --> 44:09.844
Yeah, yeah.

44:09.846 --> 44:10.979
Gibney: Did you have any evidence

44:10.981 --> 44:12.247
in terms of your analysis

44:12.249 --> 44:14.249
that would lead you to believe that

44:14.251 --> 44:15.583
that's correct also?

44:15.585 --> 44:17.685
Nothing that I could talk about on camera.

44:19.188 --> 44:21.990
Gibney: Well, can I ask why?

44:21.992 --> 44:23.825
No.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.527
Well, you can, but I won't answer.

44:27.964 --> 44:30.265
Gibney: But even in the case of nation-states,

44:30.267 --> 44:31.766
I mean, one of the concerns is...

44:31.768 --> 44:33.902
Gibney: <i>This was beginning to really piss me off.</i>

44:34.336 --> 44:37.672
<i>Even civilians with an interest in telling the STUXnet story</i>

44:37.674 --> 44:40.608
<i>were refusing to address the role of Tel Aviv</i>

44:40.610 --> 44:43.845
<i>and Washington. But luckily for me,</i>

44:44.113 --> 44:45.947
<i>while D.C. is a city of secrets,</i>

44:46.282 --> 44:48.049
<i>it is also a city of leaks.</i>

44:48.517 --> 44:50.218
<i>They're as regular as a heartbeat</i>

44:50.220 --> 44:51.953
<i>and just as hard to stop.</i>

44:52.955 --> 44:54.522
<i>That's what I was counting on.</i>

44:59.696 --> 45:03.231
<i>Finally, after speaking to a number of people on background,</i>

45:03.233 --> 45:05.833
<i>I did find a way of confirming, on the record,</i>

45:05.835 --> 45:07.702
<i>the American role in STUXnet.</i>

45:08.671 --> 45:10.805
<i>In exchange for details of the operation,</i>

45:10.807 --> 45:12.874
<i>I had to agree to find a way</i>

45:12.876 --> 45:15.176
<i>to disguise the source of the information.</i>

45:15.178 --> 45:16.945
- Gibney: <i>We're good?</i>
- Man: <i> We're on.</i>

45:18.514 --> 45:20.181
Gibney: <i>So the first question I have to ask you</i>

45:20.183 --> 45:21.583
<i>is about secrecy.</i>

45:22.084 --> 45:25.153
<i>I mean, at this point, everyone knows about STUXnet.</i>

45:25.155 --> 45:26.821
<i>Why can't we talk about it?</i>

45:27.323 --> 45:28.690
<i>It's a covert operation.</i>

45:28.692 --> 45:30.491
Gibney: <i> Not anymore.</i>

45:30.493 --> 45:32.794
<i>I mean, we know what happened, we know who did it.</i>

45:33.028 --> 45:35.730
<i>Well, maybe you don't know as much as you think you know.</i>

45:36.532 --> 45:39.100
Gibney: <i>Well, I'm talking to you because I want to</i>

45:39.102 --> 45:40.501
<i>get the story right.</i>

45:40.503 --> 45:42.463
<i>Well, that's the same reason I'm talking to you.</i>

45:44.707 --> 45:46.507
Gibney: <i>Even though it's a covert operation?</i>

45:47.543 --> 45:51.379
<i>Look, this is not a Snowden kind of thing, okay?</i>

45:51.381 --> 45:52.714
<i>I think what he did was wrong.</i>

45:52.716 --> 45:55.850
<i>He went too far. He gave away too much.</i>

45:56.352 --> 45:58.353
<i>Unlike Snowden, who was a contractor,</i>

45:58.355 --> 46:00.121
<i>I was in NSA.</i>

46:00.756 --> 46:02.957
<i>I believe in the agency, so what I'm willing to give you</i>

46:02.959 --> 46:04.592
<i>will be limited, but we're talking</i>

46:04.594 --> 46:06.427
<i>because everyone's getting the story wrong</i>

46:06.429 --> 46:08.029
<i>and we have to get it right.</i>

46:08.031 --> 46:09.797
<i>We have to understand these new weapons.</i>

46:09.799 --> 46:11.065
<i>The stakes are too high.</i>

46:11.067 --> 46:12.367
Gibney: <i> What do you mean?</i>

46:14.470 --> 46:16.437
<i>We did STUXnet.</i>

46:17.640 --> 46:18.806
<i>It's a fact.</i>

46:18.808 --> 46:22.543
<i>You know, we came so fucking close to disaster,</i>

46:22.545 --> 46:24.212
<i>and we're still on the edge.</i>

46:25.748 --> 46:30.818
<i>It was a huge multinational, interagency operation.</i>

46:32.087 --> 46:34.789
<i>In the U.S. it was CIA,</i>

46:35.257 --> 46:38.726
<i>NSA, and the military Cyber Command.</i>

46:39.228 --> 46:42.897
<i>From Britain, we used Iran intel out of GCHQ,</i>

46:43.499 --> 46:45.333
<i>but the main partner was Israel.</i>

46:45.335 --> 46:46.834
<i>Over there, Mossad ran the show,</i>

46:46.836 --> 46:49.570
<i>and the technical work was done by Unit 8200.</i>

46:50.506 --> 46:53.508
<i>Israel is really the key to the story.</i>

46:57.946 --> 47:01.015
Melman: Oh, traffic in Israel is so unpredictable.

47:03.118 --> 47:06.187
Gibney: Yossi, how did you get into this whole STUXnet story?

47:07.356 --> 47:10.358
I have been covering the Israeli intelligence

47:10.360 --> 47:12.660
in general, in the Mossad in particular

47:12.662 --> 47:16.064
<i>for nearly 30 years.</i>

47:16.465 --> 47:19.534
<i>In '82, I was a London-based correspondent</i>

47:19.536 --> 47:22.970
<i>and I covered a trial of terrorists,</i>

47:22.972 --> 47:27.275
<i>and I became more familiar with this topic of terrorism,</i>

47:27.277 --> 47:31.446
<i>and slowly but surely, I started covering it as a beat.</i>

47:34.316 --> 47:37.352
Israel, we live in a very rough neighborhood

47:37.354 --> 47:39.721
where the... the Democratic values,

47:39.723 --> 47:43.024
western values, are very rare.

47:43.459 --> 47:47.362
But Israel pretends to be a free, Democratic,

47:47.364 --> 47:49.430
westernized society,

47:49.898 --> 47:53.201
<i>posh neighborhoods, rich people,</i>

47:53.369 --> 47:56.371
<i>youngsters who are having</i>

47:56.373 --> 47:59.407
<i>almost similar mind-set to their American</i>

47:59.409 --> 48:01.642
<i>or western European counterparts.</i>

48:01.644 --> 48:04.379
<i>On the other hand, you see a lot of scenes</i>

48:04.381 --> 48:08.583
<i>and events which resemble the real Middle East,</i>

48:08.585 --> 48:14.355
<i>terror attacks, radicals, fanatics, religious zealots.</i>

48:18.728 --> 48:21.829
I knew that Israel is trying to slow down

48:21.831 --> 48:23.498
Iran's nuclear program,

48:23.500 --> 48:26.267
and therefore, I came to the conclusion that

48:26.269 --> 48:29.437
if there was a virus infecting Iran's computers,

48:29.439 --> 48:35.243
it's... it's one more element in... in this larger picture

48:35.944 --> 48:38.379
<i>based on past precedents.</i>

48:42.952 --> 48:46.621
Yadlin: <i>1981 I was an F-16 pilot,</i>

48:47.055 --> 48:50.558
<i>and we were told that, unlike our dream</i>

48:50.560 --> 48:53.995
<i>to do dogfights and to kill MIGs,</i>

48:54.563 --> 48:58.199
<i>we have to be prepared for a long-range mission</i>

48:58.867 --> 49:01.502
<i>to destroy a valuable target.</i>

49:02.271 --> 49:03.971
<i>Nobody told us what is</i>

49:03.973 --> 49:06.374
<i>this very valuable strategic target.</i>

49:07.376 --> 49:10.545
<i>It was 600 miles from Israel.</i>

49:11.914 --> 49:15.383
So we train our self to do the job,

49:15.385 --> 49:19.220
which was very difficult. No air refueling at that time.

49:19.621 --> 49:21.689
No satellites for reconnaissance.

49:23.625 --> 49:26.027
Fuel was on the limit.

49:26.595 --> 49:28.896
Pilot: <i>What? Whoa! Whoa!</i>

49:31.834 --> 49:33.234
Yadlin: <i> At the end of the day,</i>

49:33.969 --> 49:35.703
<i>we accomplished the mission.</i>

49:36.171 --> 49:37.472
Gibney: <i> Which was?</i>

49:37.940 --> 49:40.842
Yadlin: <i>To destroy the Iraqi nuclear reactor</i>

49:40.844 --> 49:44.679
<i>near Baghdad, which was called Osirak.</i>

49:44.913 --> 49:50.952
And Iraq never was able to accomplish

49:50.954 --> 49:53.521
its ambition to have a nuclear bomb.

49:55.524 --> 49:58.125
Melman: <i>Amos Yadlin, General Yadlin,</i>

49:58.127 --> 50:00.928
<i>he was the head of the military intelligence.</i>

50:01.330 --> 50:04.799
<i>The biggest unit within that organization</i>

50:04.801 --> 50:06.601
<i>was Unit 8200.</i>

50:07.302 --> 50:09.704
<i>They'd block telephones, they'd block faxes,</i>

50:09.706 --> 50:11.873
<i>they're breaking into computers.</i>

50:14.209 --> 50:16.511
<i>A decade ago, when Yadlin became</i>

50:16.513 --> 50:18.446
<i>the chief of military intelligence,</i>

50:18.947 --> 50:23.451
<i>there was no cyber warfare unit in 8200.</i>

50:26.388 --> 50:30.157
<i>So they started recruiting very talented people,</i>

50:30.159 --> 50:32.727
<i>hackers either from the military</i>

50:32.729 --> 50:35.296
or outside the military that can contribute

50:35.298 --> 50:38.466
to the project of building a cyber warfare unit.

50:41.203 --> 50:45.706
Yadlin: <i>In the 19th century, there were only Army and Navy.</i>

50:45.708 --> 50:49.510
<i>In the 20th century, we got air power</i>

50:49.512 --> 50:51.245
<i>as a third dimension of war.</i>

50:51.880 --> 50:53.848
<i>In the 21st century,</i>

50:53.850 --> 50:57.385
<i>cyber will be the fourth dimension of war.</i>

50:58.353 --> 50:59.887
<i>It's another kind of weapon</i>

50:59.889 --> 51:04.492
and it is for unlimited range in a very high speed

51:04.893 --> 51:07.028
and in a very low signature.

51:07.030 --> 51:09.564
So this give you a huge opportunity...

51:10.666 --> 51:13.935
<i>And the superpowers have to change</i>

51:13.937 --> 51:16.003
<i>the way we think about warfare.</i>

51:18.241 --> 51:20.274
Finally we are transforming our military

51:20.276 --> 51:22.944
for a new kind of war that we're fighting now...

51:24.413 --> 51:25.846
And for wars of tomorrow.

51:27.182 --> 51:29.283
<i>We have made our military better trained,</i>

51:29.285 --> 51:32.186
<i>better equipped, and better prepared</i>

51:32.188 --> 51:34.956
<i>to meet the threats facing America today</i>

51:34.958 --> 51:37.191
<i>and tomorrow and long in the future.</i>

51:40.963 --> 51:43.598
Sanger: <i>Back in the end of the Bush Administration,</i>

51:43.600 --> 51:45.533
<i>people within the U.S. government</i>

51:45.535 --> 51:48.736
<i>were just beginning to convince President Bush</i>

51:48.738 --> 51:51.639
to pour money into offensive cyber weapons.

51:52.608 --> 51:55.643
<i>STUXnet started off in the defense department.</i>

51:56.311 --> 51:58.613
<i>Then Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense,</i>

51:59.081 --> 52:01.248
<i>reviewed this program and he said,</i>

52:01.250 --> 52:03.451
<i>"this program shouldn't be in the defense department.</i>

52:03.453 --> 52:05.953
<i>This should really be under the covert authorities</i>

52:05.955 --> 52:07.788
<i>over in the intelligence world."</i>

52:08.757 --> 52:11.892
<i>So the CIA was very deeply involved</i>

52:11.894 --> 52:13.361
<i>in this operation,</i>

52:13.662 --> 52:16.297
<i>while much of the coding work was done</i>

52:16.299 --> 52:18.699
<i>by The National Security Agency</i>

52:18.900 --> 52:21.969
<i>and Unit 8200, its Israeli equivalent,</i>

52:21.971 --> 52:25.806
<i>working together with a newly created military position</i>

52:25.808 --> 52:28.142
<i>called U.S. Cyber Command.</i>

52:28.944 --> 52:33.147
<i>And interestingly, the director of The National Security Agency</i>

52:33.149 --> 52:35.750
would also have a second role

52:35.752 --> 52:39.487
as the commander of U.S. Cyber Command.

52:39.955 --> 52:43.624
<i>And U.S. Cyber Command is located</i>

52:43.626 --> 52:47.495
<i>at Fort Meade in the same building as the NSA.</i>

52:51.700 --> 52:53.734
Col. Gary D. Brown: <i>I was deployed for a year</i>

52:54.002 --> 52:57.171
<i>giving advice on air operations in Iraq and Afghanistan,</i>

52:57.173 --> 53:00.007
<i>and when I was returning home after that,</i>

53:00.009 --> 53:02.009
<i>the assignment I was given was to go</i>

53:02.011 --> 53:03.444
<i>to U.S. Cyber Command.</i>

53:04.613 --> 53:06.180
Cyber Command is a...

53:06.481 --> 53:09.850
Is the military command that's responsible for

53:09.852 --> 53:12.887
essentially the conducting of the nation's military affairs

53:12.889 --> 53:14.288
in cyberspace.

53:14.790 --> 53:17.191
<i>The stated reason the United States</i>

53:17.193 --> 53:19.360
<i>decided it needed a Cyber Command</i>

53:19.362 --> 53:22.563
<i>was because of an event called Operation Buckshot Yankee.</i>

53:23.031 --> 53:24.632
Chris Inglis: <i>In the fall of 2008,</i>

53:24.634 --> 53:27.468
<i>we found some adversaries inside</i>

53:27.470 --> 53:29.070
<i>of our classified networks.</i>

53:30.005 --> 53:31.572
While it wasn't completely true

53:31.574 --> 53:34.175
that we always assumed that we were successful

53:34.177 --> 53:35.910
at defending things at the barrier,

53:35.912 --> 53:38.079
at the... at the kind of perimeter that we might have

53:38.081 --> 53:40.081
between our networks and the outside world,

53:40.083 --> 53:42.149
there was a large confidence

53:42.151 --> 53:44.318
that we'd been mostly successful.

53:44.653 --> 53:46.220
But that was a moment in time when we came to

53:46.222 --> 53:49.790
the quick conclusion that it... it's not really ever secure.

53:50.659 --> 53:53.360
<i>That then accelerated The Department of Defense's</i>

53:53.362 --> 53:54.929
<i>progress towards what ultimately</i>

53:54.931 --> 53:56.063
<i>became Cyber Command.</i>

53:59.367 --> 54:00.568
Good morning.

54:01.870 --> 54:03.070
Good morning.

54:03.238 --> 54:05.318
Good morning, sir. Cyber has one item for you today.

54:05.774 --> 54:07.441
Earlier this week, Antok analysts

54:07.443 --> 54:09.777
detected a foreign adversary using known methods

54:09.779 --> 54:11.612
to access the U.S. military network.

54:12.080 --> 54:13.681
We identified the malicious activity

54:13.683 --> 54:15.616
via data collected through our information assurance

54:15.618 --> 54:17.118
and signals from intelligence authorities

54:17.120 --> 54:19.286
and confirmed it was a cyber adversary.

54:19.288 --> 54:21.956
We provided data to our cyber partners within the DOD...

54:21.958 --> 54:24.225
You think of NSA as an institution

54:24.227 --> 54:27.094
that essentially uses its abilities in cyberspace

54:27.462 --> 54:29.864
to help defend communications in that space.

54:30.198 --> 54:32.133
<i>Cyber Command extends that capability</i>

54:32.135 --> 54:35.503
<i>by saying that they will then take responsibility to attack.</i>

54:36.972 --> 54:39.974
Hayden: <i>NSA has no legal authority to attack.</i>

54:39.976 --> 54:42.209
<i>It's never had it, I doubt that it ever will.</i>

54:42.711 --> 54:44.779
It might explain why U.S. Cyber Command

54:44.781 --> 54:46.480
is sitting out at Fort Meade on top of

54:46.482 --> 54:48.215
The National Security Agency,

54:48.217 --> 54:50.985
because NSA has the abilities to do these things.

54:51.286 --> 54:54.088
Cyber Command has the authority to do these things.

54:54.090 --> 54:57.324
And "these things" here refer to the cyber-attack.

54:57.326 --> 54:59.360
This is a huge change

54:59.995 --> 55:03.664
for the nature of the intelligence agencies.

55:04.099 --> 55:06.901
<i>The NSA was supposed to be a code-making</i>

55:06.903 --> 55:09.270
<i>and code-breaking operation</i>

55:09.272 --> 55:13.440
<i>to monitor the communications of foreign powers</i>

55:13.442 --> 55:14.842
<i>and American adversaries</i>

55:14.844 --> 55:17.178
<i>in the defense of the United States.</i>

55:17.679 --> 55:21.182
<i>But creating a Cyber Command meant using</i>

55:21.184 --> 55:24.218
<i>the same technology to do offense.</i>

55:26.354 --> 55:30.357
<i>Once you get inside an adversary's computer networks,</i>

55:30.359 --> 55:33.194
<i>you put an implant in that network.</i>

55:33.428 --> 55:36.030
<i>And we have tens of thousands of foreign computers</i>

55:36.032 --> 55:38.766
<i>and networks that the United States put implants in.</i>

55:39.534 --> 55:42.536
<i>You can use it to monitor what's going across</i>

55:42.538 --> 55:44.538
<i>that network and you can use it</i>

55:44.540 --> 55:47.775
<i>to insert cyber weapons, malware.</i>

55:48.877 --> 55:52.079
If you can spy on a network, you can manipulate it.

55:52.781 --> 55:54.515
It's already included.

55:54.716 --> 55:57.051
The only thing you need is an act of will.

56:01.057 --> 56:02.857
NSA source: <i>I played a role in Iraq.</i>

56:02.859 --> 56:05.226
<i>I can't tell you whether it was military or not,</i>

56:05.228 --> 56:06.827
<i>but I can tell you</i>

56:06.829 --> 56:09.163
<i>NSA had combat support teams in country.</i>

56:10.700 --> 56:13.367
<i>And for the first time, units in the field</i>

56:13.369 --> 56:15.769
<i>had direct access to NSA intel.</i>

56:18.341 --> 56:20.207
<i>Over time, we thought more about offense</i>

56:20.209 --> 56:21.675
<i>than defense, you know,</i>

56:21.677 --> 56:23.410
<i>more about attacking than intelligence.</i>

56:24.713 --> 56:27.748
<i>In the old days, sigint units would try to track radios,</i>

56:27.750 --> 56:30.017
<i>but through NSA in Iraq,</i>

56:30.019 --> 56:32.052
<i>we had access to all the networks</i>

56:32.054 --> 56:33.587
<i>going in and out of the country.</i>

56:33.589 --> 56:35.656
<i>And we hoovered up every text message,</i>

56:35.658 --> 56:37.157
<i>email, and phone call.</i>

56:37.692 --> 56:40.094
<i>A complete surveillance state.</i>

56:40.996 --> 56:45.065
<i>We could find the bad guys, say, a gang making IEDs,</i>

56:45.067 --> 56:48.602
<i>map their networks, and follow them in real time.</i>

56:48.604 --> 56:49.904
Soldier: <i> Roger.</i>

56:49.906 --> 56:51.705
NSA source: <i>And we could lock into cell phones</i>

56:51.707 --> 56:53.774
<i>even when they were off and send a fake text</i>

56:53.776 --> 56:56.210
<i>from a friend, suggest a meeting place,</i>

56:56.212 --> 56:58.078
<i>and then capture...</i>

56:58.080 --> 56:59.446
Soldier: <i> 1A, clear to fire.</i>

56:59.915 --> 57:01.215
<i>...or kill.</i>

57:01.217 --> 57:02.316
Soldier: <i> Good shot.</i>

57:05.353 --> 57:07.621
Brown: <i>A lot of the people that came to Cyber Command,</i>

57:07.623 --> 57:09.456
<i>the military guys, came directly from</i>

57:09.458 --> 57:11.458
<i>an assignment in Afghanistan or Iraq,</i>

57:11.460 --> 57:14.028
<i>'cause those are the people with experience</i>

57:14.030 --> 57:15.963
<i>and expertise in operations,</i>

57:15.965 --> 57:17.898
and those are the ones you want looking at this

57:17.900 --> 57:19.934
to see how cyber could facilitate

57:19.936 --> 57:22.169
traditional military operations.

57:33.882 --> 57:35.716
NSA source: <i>Fresh from the surge,</i>

57:35.718 --> 57:40.220
<i>I went to work at NSA in '07 in a supervisory capacity.</i>

57:40.222 --> 57:42.389
Gibney: <i>Exactly where did you work?</i>

57:42.391 --> 57:43.724
NSA source: <i> Fort Meade.</i>

57:43.726 --> 57:45.459
<i>You know, I commuted to that massive complex</i>

57:45.461 --> 57:46.894
<i>every single day.</i>

57:48.229 --> 57:52.533
<i>I was in TAO-S321, "The Roc."</i>

57:53.101 --> 57:55.169
Gibney: <i>Okay, the TAO, The Roc?</i>

57:55.337 --> 57:58.572
<i>Right, sorry. TAO is tailored access operations.</i>

57:58.574 --> 58:00.607
<i>It's where NSA's hackers work.</i>

58:00.609 --> 58:02.376
<i>Of course, we didn't call them that.</i>

58:02.644 --> 58:03.978
Gibney: <i> What did you call them?</i>

58:04.145 --> 58:05.512
NSA source: <i> On net operators.</i>

58:05.814 --> 58:08.349
<i>They're the only people at NSA allowed to break in</i>

58:08.351 --> 58:09.850
<i>or attack on the Internet.</i>

58:10.852 --> 58:12.953
<i>Inside TAO headquarters is The Roc,</i>

58:12.955 --> 58:14.555
<i>remote operations center.</i>

58:15.357 --> 58:18.559
<i>If the U.S. government wants to get in somewhere,</i>

58:19.627 --> 58:21.028
<i>it goes to The Roc.</i>

58:21.196 --> 58:24.064
<i>I mean, we were flooded with requests.</i>

58:24.799 --> 58:27.334
<i>So many that we could only do about, mm,</i>

58:27.336 --> 58:30.504
<i>30% of the missions that were requested of us at one time,</i>

58:30.506 --> 58:32.139
<i>through the web</i>

58:32.141 --> 58:35.009
<i>but also by hijacking shipments of parts.</i>

58:35.877 --> 58:37.878
<i>You know, sometimes the CIA would assist</i>

58:37.880 --> 58:40.514
<i>inputting implants in machines,</i>

58:41.716 --> 58:44.451
<i>so once inside a target network,</i>

58:45.320 --> 58:46.587
<i>we could just...</i>

58:47.555 --> 58:48.756
<i>Watch...</i>

58:50.492 --> 58:52.059
<i>Or we could attack.</i>

58:55.864 --> 58:59.400
<i>Inside NSA was a strange kind of culture,</i>

58:59.402 --> 59:01.802
<i>like, two parts macho military</i>

59:01.804 --> 59:05.906
<i>and two parts cyber geek. I mean, I came from Iraq,</i>

59:05.908 --> 59:07.808
<i>so I was used to, "Yes, sir. No, sir."</i>

59:07.810 --> 59:09.910
<i>But for the weapons programmers</i>

59:09.912 --> 59:12.479
<i>we needed more "think outside the box" types.</i>

59:13.314 --> 59:15.049
<i>From cubicle to cubicle,</i>

59:15.051 --> 59:18.318
<i>you'd see lightsabers, Tribbles,</i>

59:18.320 --> 59:20.487
<i>those</i> Naruto <i> action figures,</i>

59:20.489 --> 59:22.790
<i>lots of</i> Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

59:25.527 --> 59:29.129
<i>This one guy, they were mostly guys,</i>

59:30.098 --> 59:32.232
<i>who liked to wear a yellow hooded cape,</i>

59:32.700 --> 59:36.303
<i>he used a ton of gray Legos to build a massive Death Star.</i>

59:39.340 --> 59:41.508
Gibney: <i>Were they all working on STUXnet?</i>

59:42.077 --> 59:44.111
NSA source: <i>We never called it STUXnet.</i>

59:44.113 --> 59:46.880
<i>That was the name invented by the antivirus guys.</i>

59:46.882 --> 59:48.882
<i>When it hit the papers,</i>

59:48.884 --> 59:50.884
<i>we're not allowed to read about classified operations,</i>

59:50.886 --> 59:52.386
<i>even if it's in</i> The New York Times.

59:52.388 --> 59:54.088
<i>We went out of our way to avoid the term.</i>

59:54.090 --> 59:56.023
<i>I mean, saying "STUXnet" out loud</i>

59:56.025 --> 59:58.192
<i>was like saying "Voldemort" in</i> Harry Potter.

59:58.194 --> 59:59.827
<i>The name that shall not be spoken.</i>

01:00:00.128 --> 01:00:01.628
Gibney: <i>What did you call it then?</i>

01:00:10.105 --> 01:00:13.640
<i>The Natanz attack, and this is out there already,</i>

01:00:14.542 --> 01:00:18.512
<i>was called Olympic Games or OG.</i>

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.485
<i>There was a huge operation to test the code</i>

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.854
<i>on PLCs here are Fort Meade</i>

01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:29.857
<i>and in Sandia, New Mexico.</i>

01:00:31.626 --> 01:00:33.060
<i>Remember during the Bush era</i>

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:35.496
<i>when Libya turned over all the centrifuges?</i>

01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:38.098
<i>Those were the same models the Iranians got</i>

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.400
<i>from A.Q. Khan. P1s.</i>

01:00:41.803 --> 01:00:44.271
<i>We took them to Oak Ridge and used them</i>

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:47.808
<i>to test the code which demolished the insides.</i>

01:00:48.843 --> 01:00:52.713
<i>At Dimona, the Israelis also tested on the P1s.</i>

01:00:54.149 --> 01:00:56.750
<i>Then, partly by using our intel on Iran,</i>

01:00:56.752 --> 01:00:59.987
<i>we got the plans for the newer models, the IR-2s.</i>

01:01:00.855 --> 01:01:03.090
<i>We tried out different attack vectors.</i>

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:07.394
<i>We ended up focusing on ways to destroy the rotor tubes.</i>

01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:11.732
<i>In the tests we ran, we blew them apart.</i>

01:01:13.201 --> 01:01:15.135
They swept up the pieces,

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:17.838
they put it on an airplane, they flew it to Washington,

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.540
they stuck it in the truck,

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.508
they drove it through the gates of the White House,

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:25.646
and dumped the shards out on the conference room table

01:01:25.648 --> 01:01:27.347
in the Situation Room.

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:28.882
And then they invited President Bush

01:01:28.884 --> 01:01:30.450
to come down and take a look.

01:01:30.452 --> 01:01:32.286
And when he could pick up the shard

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:34.054
of a piece of centrifuge...

01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:37.257
He was convinced this might be worth it,

01:01:37.559 --> 01:01:39.359
and he said, "go ahead and try."

01:01:40.195 --> 01:01:43.130
Gibney: Was there legal concern inside the Bush Administration

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.532
that this might be an act of undeclared war?

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:50.237
If there were concerns, I haven't found them.

01:01:51.506 --> 01:01:54.174
That doesn't mean that they didn't exist

01:01:54.176 --> 01:01:56.176
and that some lawyers somewhere

01:01:56.178 --> 01:01:57.744
weren't concerned about it,

01:01:57.746 --> 01:02:01.081
but this was an entirely new territory.

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:04.184
At the time, there were really very few people

01:02:04.186 --> 01:02:08.322
who had expertise specifically on the law of war and cyber.

01:02:08.723 --> 01:02:10.991
And basically what we did was looking at, okay,

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.459
here's our broad direction.

01:02:13.027 --> 01:02:15.629
Now, let's look... technically what can we do

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.898
to facilitate this broad direction?

01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:21.034
After that, maybe the... I would come in

01:02:21.036 --> 01:02:23.604
or one of my lawyers would come in and say,

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:27.574
"okay, this is what we <i>may</i> do." Okay.

01:02:28.677 --> 01:02:29.776
There are many things we can do,

01:02:29.778 --> 01:02:31.778
but we are not allowed to do them.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:33.914
And then after that, there's still a final level

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:35.816
that we look at and that's, what should we do?

01:02:36.217 --> 01:02:38.185
Because there are many things that would be

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:41.455
technically possible and technically legal

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:42.990
but a bad idea.

01:02:43.524 --> 01:02:47.227
<i>For Natanz, it was a CIA-led operation,</i>

01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:49.663
<i>so we had to have agency sign-off.</i>

01:02:49.964 --> 01:02:51.131
Gibney: <i> Really?</i>

01:02:51.299 --> 01:02:54.134
<i>Someone from the agency</i>

01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:57.104
<i>stood behind the operator and the analyst</i>

01:02:57.106 --> 01:03:00.040
<i>and gave the order to launch every attack.</i>

01:03:07.649 --> 01:03:09.483
Chien: <i>Before they had even started this attack,</i>

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.718
<i>they put inside of the code the kill date,</i>

01:03:12.053 --> 01:03:13.820
<i>a date at which it would stop operating.</i>

01:03:14.389 --> 01:03:16.490
O'Murchu: <i>Cutoff dates, we don't normally see that</i>

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.158
<i>in other threats, and you have to think,</i>

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.060
<i>"well, why is there a cutoff date in there?"</i>

01:03:20.495 --> 01:03:22.929
And when you realize that, well, STUXnet was probably

01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:26.133
written by government and that there are laws

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:29.002
regarding how you can use this sort of software,

01:03:29.004 --> 01:03:31.638
that there may have been a legal team who said, "no, you...

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.840
You need to have a cutoff date in there,

01:03:33.842 --> 01:03:35.942
and you can only do this and you can only go that far

01:03:35.944 --> 01:03:37.744
and we need to check if this is legal or not.

01:03:39.614 --> 01:03:42.883
<i>That date is a few days before Obama's inauguration.</i>

01:03:43.918 --> 01:03:46.787
<i>So the theory was that this was an operation</i>

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.189
<i>that needed to be stopped at a certain time</i>

01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:51.591
<i>because there was gonna be a handover</i>

01:03:51.593 --> 01:03:53.927
<i>and that more approval was needed.</i>

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.032
Are you prepared to take the oath, senator?

01:03:59.034 --> 01:04:00.267
I am.

01:04:00.635 --> 01:04:02.602
I, Barack Hussein Obama...

01:04:02.604 --> 01:04:04.137
- I, Barack...
- Do solemnly swear...

01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:06.740
I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear...

01:04:06.941 --> 01:04:10.477
Sanger: <i>Olympic Games was reauthorized by President Obama</i>

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.279
<i>in his first year in office, 2009.</i>

01:04:16.784 --> 01:04:18.885
<i>It was fascinating because it was the first year of</i>

01:04:18.887 --> 01:04:20.887
<i>the Obama administration and they would talk to you</i>

01:04:20.889 --> 01:04:23.690
<i>endlessly about cyber defense.</i>

01:04:24.459 --> 01:04:25.625
Obama: <i>We count on computer networks</i>

01:04:25.627 --> 01:04:28.762
<i>to deliver our oil and gas, our power, and our water.</i>

01:04:29.063 --> 01:04:32.299
<i>We rely on them for public transportation</i>

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:33.867
<i>and air traffic control.</i>

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:36.336
But just as we failed in the past

01:04:36.338 --> 01:04:38.372
to invest in our physical infrastructure,

01:04:38.673 --> 01:04:41.041
our roads, our Bridges, and rails,

01:04:41.376 --> 01:04:43.076
we failed to invest in the security

01:04:43.078 --> 01:04:44.945
of our digital infrastructure.

01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:47.547
Sanger: <i>He was running East Room events</i>

01:04:47.749 --> 01:04:50.484
<i>trying to get people to focus on the need to</i>

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:52.419
<i>defend cyber networks</i>

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:54.154
and defend American infrastructure.

01:04:54.522 --> 01:04:58.058
But when you asked questions about the use of

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.661
offensive cyber weapons, everything went dead.

01:05:01.663 --> 01:05:03.397
No cooperation.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.499
White House wouldn't help, Pentagon wouldn't help,

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:06.666
NSA wouldn't help.

01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:08.335
Nobody would talk to you about it.

01:05:09.237 --> 01:05:10.871
<i>But when you dug into the budget</i>

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:14.107
<i>for cyber spending during the Obama administration,</i>

01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:16.042
<i>what you discovered was</i>

01:05:16.044 --> 01:05:19.446
<i>much of it was being spent on offensive cyber weapons.</i>

01:05:21.249 --> 01:05:25.752
<i>You see phrases like "Title 10 CNO."</i>

01:05:26.187 --> 01:05:29.456
<i>Title 10 means operations for the U.S. military,</i>

01:05:29.724 --> 01:05:33.994
<i>and CNO means computer network operations.</i>

01:05:34.695 --> 01:05:36.263
<i>This is considerable evidence</i>

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.865
that STUXnet was just the opening wedge

01:05:39.534 --> 01:05:43.336
of what is a much broader U.S. government effort now

01:05:43.771 --> 01:05:46.807
to develop an entire new class of weapons.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.115
Chien: <i>STUXnet wasn't just an evolution.</i>

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.784
<i>It was really a revolution in the threat landscape.</i>

01:05:59.587 --> 01:06:02.556
<i>In the past, the vast majority of threats that we saw</i>

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.558
<i>were always controlled by an operator somewhere.</i>

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.259
They would infect your machines,

01:06:06.261 --> 01:06:08.094
but they would have what's called a callback

01:06:08.096 --> 01:06:09.629
or a command-and-control channel.

01:06:09.797 --> 01:06:11.932
The threats would actually contact the operator

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.333
and say, what do you want me to do next?

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:14.901
And the operator would send down commands

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:16.837
<i>and say, maybe, search through this directory,</i>

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.772
<i>find these folders, find these files,</i>

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.607
<i>upload these files to me, spread to this other machine,</i>

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.075
<i>things of that nature.</i>

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:25.679
<i>But STUXnet couldn't have a command-and-control channel</i>

01:06:26.147 --> 01:06:28.915
because once it got inside in Natanz

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:31.651
it would not have been able to reach back out to the attackers.

01:06:31.653 --> 01:06:33.954
The Natanz network is completely air gapped

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.155
from the rest of the Internet.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.523
It's not connected to the Internet.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:37.991
It's its own isolated network.

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.759
Generally, getting across an air gap is...

01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:41.361
Is one of the more difficult challenges

01:06:41.363 --> 01:06:43.630
that attackers will face just because of the fact that

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:46.533
there... everything is in place to prevent that.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:49.102
You know, everything, you know, the policies and procedures

01:06:49.104 --> 01:06:51.004
and the physical network that's in place is

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:54.474
specifically designed to prevent you crossing the air gap.

01:06:54.476 --> 01:06:56.943
But there's no truly air-gapped network

01:06:56.945 --> 01:06:59.212
in these real-world production environments.

01:06:59.214 --> 01:07:01.281
People gotta get new code into Natanz.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:04.184
People have to get log files off of this network in Natanz.

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:05.652
People have to upgrade equipment.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.354
People have to upgrade computers.

01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:10.690
This highlights one of the major

01:07:11.192 --> 01:07:14.127
security issues that we have in the field.

01:07:14.129 --> 01:07:17.030
If you think, "well, nobody can attack

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.299
this power plant or this chemical plant

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:21.034
because it's not connected to the Internet,"

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.903
that's a bizarre illusion.

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:29.876
NSA source: <i>The first time we introduced the code into Natanz</i>

01:07:30.411 --> 01:07:32.212
<i>we used human assets,</i>

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.650
<i>maybe CIA, more likely Mossad,</i>

01:07:36.652 --> 01:07:40.053
<i>but our team was kept in the dark about the trade craft.</i>

01:07:40.988 --> 01:07:43.490
<i>We heard rumors in Moscow,</i>

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:47.327
<i>an Iranian laptop infected by a phony Siemens technician</i>

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.628
<i>with a flash drive...</i>

01:07:50.164 --> 01:07:53.300
<i>A double agent in Iran with access to Natanz,</i>

01:07:53.868 --> 01:07:55.602
<i>but I don't really know.</i>

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:58.305
<i>What we had to focus on was to write the code</i>

01:07:58.906 --> 01:08:02.342
<i>so that, once inside, the worm acted on its own.</i>

01:08:02.543 --> 01:08:04.911
They built in all the code and all the logic

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:07.714
into the threat to be able to operate all by itself.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.950
<i>It had the ability to spread by itself.</i>

01:08:09.952 --> 01:08:13.019
<i>It had the ability to figure out, do I have the right PLCs?</i>

01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:15.956
<i>Have I arrived in Natanz? Am I at the target?</i>

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.524
Langner: <i>And when it's on target,</i>

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.693
<i>it executes autonomously.</i>

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.363
That also means you... you cannot call off the attack.

01:08:24.031 --> 01:08:25.765
It was definitely the type of attack

01:08:26.367 --> 01:08:27.867
where someone had decided

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.370
that this is what they wanted to do.

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:33.707
There was no turning back once STUXnet was released.

01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:41.046
<i>When it began to actually execute its payload,</i>

01:08:41.049 --> 01:08:43.316
<i>you would have a whole bunch of centrifuges</i>

01:08:43.318 --> 01:08:46.419
<i>in a huge array of cascades sitting in a big hall.</i>

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:48.622
<i>And then just off that hall</i>

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.423
<i>you would have an operators room,</i>

01:08:50.425 --> 01:08:52.292
<i>the control panels in front of them, a big window</i>

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.734
<i>where they could see into the hall.</i>

01:08:54.295 --> 01:08:56.496
<i>Computers monitor the activities</i>

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:57.863
<i>of all these centrifuges.</i>

01:08:58.733 --> 01:09:02.801
So a centrifuge, it's driven by an electrical motor.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:06.305
And the speed of this electrical motor

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:09.509
is controlled by another PLC,

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:11.211
by another programmable logic controller.

01:09:13.413 --> 01:09:17.117
Chien: <i>STUXnet would wait for 13 days</i>

01:09:17.118 --> 01:09:18.417
<i>before doing anything,</i>

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.520
<i>because 13 days is about the time it takes</i>

01:09:20.522 --> 01:09:23.490
<i>to actually fill an entire cascade of centrifuges</i>

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.024
<i>with uranium.</i>

01:09:25.326 --> 01:09:28.161
They didn't want to attack when the centrifuges essentially

01:09:28.162 --> 01:09:30.529
were empty or at the beginning of the enrichment process.

01:09:31.799 --> 01:09:34.167
<i>What STUXnet did was it actually would sit there</i>

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:36.870
<i>during the 13 days and basically record</i>

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:38.872
<i>all of the normal activities</i>

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:40.407
<i>that were happening and save it.</i>

01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:43.542
<i>And once they saw them spinning for 13 days,</i>

01:09:43.545 --> 01:09:45.178
<i>then the attack occurred.</i>

01:09:45.946 --> 01:09:48.214
<i>Centrifuges spin at incredible speeds,</i>

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:50.149
<i>about 1,000 hertz.</i>

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:52.519
Langner: <i>They have a safe operating speed,</i>

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.355
<i>63,000 revolutions per minute.</i>

01:09:55.656 --> 01:09:58.224
Chien: <i>STUXnet caused the uranium enrichment centrifuges</i>

01:09:58.226 --> 01:10:00.527
<i>to spin up to 1,400 hertz.</i>

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:03.263
Langner: <i>Up to 80,000 revolutions per minute.</i>

01:10:06.734 --> 01:10:09.169
What would happen was those centrifuges

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.438
would go through what's called a resonance frequency.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:14.207
<i>It would go through a frequency at which the metal would</i>

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.076
<i>basically vibrate uncontrollably</i>

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:17.377
<i>and essentially shatter.</i>

01:10:17.545 --> 01:10:19.746
<i>There'd be uranium gas everywhere.</i>

01:10:20.881 --> 01:10:22.749
And then the second attack they attempted

01:10:22.751 --> 01:10:25.051
was they actually tried to lower it to two hertz.

01:10:25.053 --> 01:10:28.755
They were slowed down to almost standstill.

01:10:29.523 --> 01:10:32.058
Chien: <i>And at two hertz, sort of an opposite effect occurs.</i>

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.327
<i>You can imagine a toy top that you spin</i>

01:10:34.329 --> 01:10:37.230
<i>and as the top begins to slow down, it begins to wobble.</i>

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:39.232
<i>That's what would happen to these centrifuges.</i>

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:41.267
<i>They'd begin to wobble and essentially shatter</i>

01:10:41.269 --> 01:10:42.502
<i>and fall apart.</i>

01:10:46.274 --> 01:10:49.109
And instead of sending back to the computer

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:50.744
what was really happening, it would send back

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.712
that old data that it had recorded.

01:10:52.714 --> 01:10:54.514
<i>So the computer's sitting there thinking,</i>

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.216
<i>"yep, running at 1,000 hertz, everything is fine.</i>

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:58.118
<i>Running at 1,000 hertz, everything is fine."</i>

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.954
<i>But those centrifuges are potentially spinning up wildly,</i>

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.756
<i>a huge noise would occur.</i>

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.758
<i>It'd be like, you know, a jet engine.</i>

01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:09.896
So the operators then would know, "whoa,

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.531
something is going wrong here."

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.466
They might look at their monitors and say, "hmm,

01:11:13.468 --> 01:11:15.935
it says it's 1,000 hertz," but they would hear that in the room

01:11:15.937 --> 01:11:17.737
something gravely bad was happening.

01:11:17.739 --> 01:11:21.107
Not only are the operators fooled into thinking

01:11:21.109 --> 01:11:22.909
everything's normal,

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:27.247
but also any kind of automated protective logic

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:29.015
is fooled.

01:11:29.884 --> 01:11:31.844
Chien: <i>You can't just turn these centrifuges off.</i>

01:11:32.086 --> 01:11:34.721
<i>They have to be brought down in a very controlled manner.</i>

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.890
<i>And so they would hit, literally, the big red button</i>

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.491
<i>to initiate a graceful shutdown,</i>

01:11:38.826 --> 01:11:40.927
<i>and STUXnet intercepts that code.</i>

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.495
<i>So you would have these operators</i>

01:11:42.497 --> 01:11:44.631
<i>slamming on that button over and over again</i>

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:45.799
<i>and nothing would happen.</i>

01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:50.670
Yadlin: <i>If your cyber weapon is good enough,</i>

01:11:50.672 --> 01:11:53.406
<i>if your enemy is not aware of it,</i>

01:11:53.674 --> 01:11:57.310
it is an ideal weapon, because the enemy

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:59.379
even don't understand what is happening to it.

01:11:59.947 --> 01:12:01.915
Gibney: Maybe even better if the enemy begins to doubt

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:04.217
- their own capability.
- Absolutely.

01:12:04.919 --> 01:12:07.787
Certainly one must conclude

01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:10.590
that what happened at Natanz

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.992
must have driven the engineers crazy,

01:12:12.994 --> 01:12:15.461
<i>because the worst thing that can happen</i>

01:12:15.463 --> 01:12:19.365
<i>to a maintenance engineer is not being able to figure out</i>

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:22.168
<i>what the cause of specific trouble is.</i>

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:25.538
<i>So they must have been analyzing themselves to death.</i>

01:12:28.275 --> 01:12:31.077
Heinonen: <i>You know, you see centrifuges blowing up.</i>

01:12:31.445 --> 01:12:35.248
<i>You look the computer screens, they go with the proper speed.</i>

01:12:35.616 --> 01:12:39.285
There's a proper gas pressure. Everything looks beautiful.

01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:45.024
Sanger: <i>Through 2009 it was going pretty smoothly.</i>

01:12:45.026 --> 01:12:46.860
<i>Centrifuges were blowing up.</i>

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.529
<i>The International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors</i>

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:52.031
<i>would go in to Natanz and they would see that</i>

01:12:52.033 --> 01:12:54.934
<i>whole sections of the centrifuges had been removed.</i>

01:12:56.170 --> 01:12:59.239
The United States knew from its intelligence channels

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.742
that some Iranian scientists and engineers

01:13:02.744 --> 01:13:06.512
were being fired because the centrifuges were blowing up

01:13:06.514 --> 01:13:09.649
and the Iranians had assumed that this was because

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:13.152
they had been making errors or manufacturing mistakes.

01:13:13.154 --> 01:13:14.787
Clearly this was somebody's fault.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:17.924
So the program was doing

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.759
exactly what it was supposed to be doing,

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.829
which was it was blowing up centrifuges

01:13:23.063 --> 01:13:24.898
and it was leaving no trace

01:13:25.566 --> 01:13:27.667
and leaving the Iranians to wonder

01:13:28.102 --> 01:13:29.469
what they got hit by.

01:13:29.937 --> 01:13:32.572
This was the brilliance of Olympic Games.

01:13:32.873 --> 01:13:34.574
You know, as a former director of a couple of big

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.842
3-letter agencies,

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.645
slowing down 1,000 centrifuges in Natanz...

01:13:39.513 --> 01:13:40.847
Abnormally good.

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:43.449
There was a need for... for... for buying time.

01:13:43.451 --> 01:13:46.085
There was a need for slowing them down.

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:48.021
There was the need to try to push them

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.389
to the negotiating table.

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.691
I mean, there are a lot of variables at play here.

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:59.666
Sanger: <i>President Obama would go down into the Situation Room,</i>

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:03.369
<i>and he would have laid out in front of him</i>

01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:05.038
<i>what they called the horse blanket,</i>

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.240
<i>which was a giant schematic</i>

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:10.710
<i>of the Natanz nuclear enrichment plan.</i>

01:14:11.278 --> 01:14:14.380
<i>And the designers of Olympic Games</i>

01:14:14.382 --> 01:14:17.550
<i>would describe to him what kind of progress they made</i>

01:14:17.552 --> 01:14:19.819
<i>and look for him for the authorization</i>

01:14:19.821 --> 01:14:22.055
<i>to move on ahead to the next attack.</i>

01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:25.925
<i>And at one point during those discussions,</i>

01:14:25.927 --> 01:14:27.660
<i>he said to a number of his aides,</i>

01:14:27.662 --> 01:14:29.262
<i>"you know, I have some concerns</i>

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:31.731
<i>because once word of this gets out,"</i>

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.399
<i>and eventually he knew it would get out,</i>

01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:35.401
<i>"the Chinese may use it as an excuse</i>

01:14:35.403 --> 01:14:38.738
<i>for their attacks on us. The Russians might or others."</i>

01:14:39.273 --> 01:14:42.308
So he clearly had some misgivings,

01:14:42.943 --> 01:14:44.744
but they weren't big enough to stop him

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:46.145
from going ahead with the program.

01:14:47.348 --> 01:14:50.516
<i>And then in 2010,</i>

01:14:50.851 --> 01:14:54.087
<i>a decision was made to change the code.</i>

01:14:59.927 --> 01:15:01.361
<i>Our human assets</i>

01:15:01.996 --> 01:15:05.465
<i>weren't always able to get code updates into Natanz</i>

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.600
<i>and we weren't told exactly why,</i>

01:15:08.168 --> 01:15:12.205
<i>but we were told we had to have a cyber solution</i>

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:13.706
<i>for delivering the code.</i>

01:15:14.141 --> 01:15:16.709
<i>But the delivery systems were tricky.</i>

01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:19.679
<i>If they weren't aggressive enough, they wouldn't get in.</i>

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.348
<i>If they were too aggressive, they could spread</i>

01:15:22.783 --> 01:15:24.017
<i>and be discovered.</i>

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.787
Chien: <i>When we got the first sample,</i>

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:30.123
<i>there was some configuration information inside of it.</i>

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:33.359
<i>And one of the pieces in there was a version number, 1.1</i>

01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:35.661
and that made us realize,

01:15:35.663 --> 01:15:37.897
well, look, this likely isn't the only copy.

01:15:37.899 --> 01:15:40.133
We went back through our databases looking for

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:42.602
anything that looks similar to STUXnet.

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:46.039
Chien: <i>As we began to collect more samples,</i>

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.940
<i>we found a few earlier versions of STUXnet.</i>

01:15:49.009 --> 01:15:50.710
O'Murchu: <i>And when we analyzed that code,</i>

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:53.379
<i>we saw that versions previous to 1.1</i>

01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:55.048
<i>were a lot less aggressive.</i>

01:15:55.516 --> 01:15:57.350
The earlier version of STUXnet,

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:59.519
it basically required humans to do a little bit

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.854
of double clicking in order for it to spread

01:16:01.856 --> 01:16:03.389
from one computer to another.

01:16:03.391 --> 01:16:05.658
And, so, what we believe after looking at that code

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.793
is two things,

01:16:07.194 --> 01:16:09.495
one, either they didn't get in to Natanz

01:16:09.497 --> 01:16:10.730
with that earlier version,

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.331
because it simply wasn't aggressive enough,

01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:14.067
wasn't able to jump over that air gap,

01:16:15.035 --> 01:16:17.870
and/or two, that payload as well

01:16:17.872 --> 01:16:21.174
didn't work properly, didn't work to their satisfaction,

01:16:21.442 --> 01:16:23.276
maybe was not explosive enough.

01:16:23.844 --> 01:16:26.079
<i>There were slightly different versions</i>

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:28.414
<i>which were aimed at different parts</i>

01:16:28.416 --> 01:16:30.049
<i>of the centrifuge cascade.</i>

01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:33.052
Gibney: <i>But the guys at Symantec figured you changed the code</i>

01:16:33.054 --> 01:16:34.854
<i>because the first variations couldn't get in</i>

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.022
<i>and didn't work right.</i>

01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:37.290
<i>Bullshit.</i>

01:16:38.092 --> 01:16:40.359
<i>We always found a way to get across the air gap.</i>

01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:42.628
<i>At TAO, we laughed when people thought they were</i>

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:44.297
<i>protected by an air gap.</i>

01:16:44.965 --> 01:16:48.000
<i>And for OG, the early versions of the payload did work.</i>

01:16:48.469 --> 01:16:50.269
<i>But what NSA did...</i>

01:16:51.872 --> 01:16:54.674
<i>Was always low-key and subtle.</i>

01:16:55.776 --> 01:16:59.045
<i>The problem was that Unit 8200, the Israelis,</i>

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:01.180
<i>kept pushing us to be more aggressive.</i>

01:17:02.816 --> 01:17:05.451
Chien: <i>The later version of STUXnet 1.1,</i>

01:17:05.453 --> 01:17:07.587
<i>that version had multiple ways of spreading.</i>

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.789
Had the four zero days inside of it, for example,

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.591
that allowed it to spread all by itself

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:12.725
without you doing anything.

01:17:12.727 --> 01:17:14.327
It could spread via network shares.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:16.229
It could spread via USB keys.

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:18.631
It was able to spread via network exploits.

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:20.166
That's the sample that introduced us

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:22.168
to stolen digital certificates.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.604
That is the sample that, all of a sudden,

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.772
became so noisy

01:17:26.774 --> 01:17:29.876
and caught the attention of the antivirus guys.

01:17:30.777 --> 01:17:33.412
In the first sample we don't find that.

01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:40.820
And this is very strange, because it tells us that

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:43.089
in the process of this development

01:17:43.624 --> 01:17:46.192
the attackers were less concerned

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:48.027
with operational security.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.068
Chien: <i>STUXnet actually kept a log inside of itself</i>

01:17:56.770 --> 01:17:59.205
<i>of all the machines that it infected along the way</i>

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.274
<i>as it jumped from one machine to another</i>

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:02.441
<i>to another to another.</i>

01:18:02.876 --> 01:18:04.844
<i>And we were able to gather up</i>

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.879
<i>all the samples that we could acquire,</i>

01:18:07.047 --> 01:18:10.316
<i>tens of thousands of samples. We extracted all of those logs.</i>

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:13.019
O'Murchu: <i>We could see the exact path that STUXnet took.</i>

01:18:15.155 --> 01:18:17.190
Chien: <i>Eventually, we were able to trace back</i>

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.358
<i>this version of STUXnet to ground zero,</i>

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.195
to the first five infections in the world.

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.865
<i>The first five infections are all outside a Natanz plant,</i>

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:28.868
<i>all inside of organizations inside of Iran,</i>

01:18:29.636 --> 01:18:31.904
<i>all organizations that are involved in</i>

01:18:31.906 --> 01:18:34.340
<i>industrial control systems and construction</i>

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.975
<i>of industrial control facilities,</i>

01:18:36.243 --> 01:18:39.812
<i>clearly contractors who were working on the Natanz facility.</i>

01:18:39.814 --> 01:18:41.547
<i>And the attackers knew that.</i>

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:44.884
They were electrical companies. They were piping companies.

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.485
They were, you know, these sorts of companies.

01:18:46.687 --> 01:18:48.321
And they knew... they knew the technicians

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:50.056
from those companies would visit Natanz.

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.624
So they would infect these companies

01:18:51.825 --> 01:18:54.860
and then technicians would take their computer

01:18:54.862 --> 01:18:56.162
or their laptop or their USB...

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.930
That operator then goes down to Natanz

01:18:57.932 --> 01:19:00.099
and he plugs in his USB key, which has some code

01:19:00.101 --> 01:19:02.001
<i>that he needs to update into Natanz,</i>

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.569
<i>into the Natanz network,</i>

01:19:03.571 --> 01:19:05.238
<i>and now STUXnet is able to get inside Natanz</i>

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.606
<i>and conduct its attack.</i>

01:19:07.841 --> 01:19:10.209
These five companies were specifically targeted

01:19:10.211 --> 01:19:12.078
to spread STUXnet into Natanz

01:19:12.279 --> 01:19:15.514
and that it wasn't that... that STUXnet escaped out of Natanz

01:19:15.516 --> 01:19:17.016
and then spread all over the world

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:19.452
and it was this big mistake and "oh, it wasn't meant

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.187
to spread that far but it really did."

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.922
No, that's not the way we see it.

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:25.858
The way we see it is that they wanted it to spread far

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.526
so that they could get it into Natanz.

01:19:27.728 --> 01:19:31.631
Someone decided that we're gonna create something new,

01:19:31.865 --> 01:19:32.932
something evolved,

01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:35.701
that's gonna be far, far, far more aggressive.

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:39.805
And we're okay, frankly,

01:19:39.807 --> 01:19:42.508
with it spreading all over the world to innocent machines

01:19:42.743 --> 01:19:44.310
in order to go after our target.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:55.221
The Mossad had the role, had the... the assignment

01:19:55.922 --> 01:20:01.827
to deliver the virus to make sure that STUXnet

01:20:01.829 --> 01:20:06.699
<i>would be put in place in Natanz to affect the centrifuges.</i>

01:20:08.568 --> 01:20:10.770
<i>Meir Dagan, the head of Mossad,</i>

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:14.073
<i>was under growing pressure from the prime minister,</i>

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:16.942
<i>Benjamin Netanyahu, to produce results.</i>

01:20:18.846 --> 01:20:20.012
<i>Inside The Roc,</i>

01:20:20.014 --> 01:20:22.081
<i>we were furious.</i>

01:20:23.817 --> 01:20:26.652
<i>The Israelis took our code for the delivery system</i>

01:20:27.254 --> 01:20:28.554
<i>and changed it.</i>

01:20:29.956 --> 01:20:32.458
<i>Then, on their own, without our agreement,</i>

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.260
<i>they just fucking launched it.</i>

01:20:34.928 --> 01:20:36.829
<i>2010 around the same time</i>

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:38.631
<i>they started killing Iranian scientists...</i>

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:40.366
<i>And they fucked up the code!</i>

01:20:40.801 --> 01:20:42.335
<i>Instead of hiding,</i>

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.804
<i>the code started shutting down computers,</i>

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.572
<i>so naturally, people noticed.</i>

01:20:48.508 --> 01:20:51.510
<i>Because they were in a hurry, they opened Pandora's Box.</i>

01:20:52.546 --> 01:20:53.646
<i>They let it out</i>

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:56.949
<i>and it spread all over the world.</i>

01:21:02.122 --> 01:21:03.923
Gibney: <i>The worm spread quickly</i>

01:21:04.191 --> 01:21:06.025
<i>but somehow it remained unseen</i>

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.060
<i>until it was identified in Belarus.</i>

01:21:09.062 --> 01:21:11.630
<i>Soon after, Israeli intelligence confirmed</i>

01:21:11.632 --> 01:21:13.632
<i>that it had made its way into the hands</i>

01:21:13.634 --> 01:21:15.634
<i>of the Russian federal security service,</i>

01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:17.603
<i>a successor to the KGB.</i>

01:21:19.172 --> 01:21:22.575
<i>So it happened that the formula for a secret cyber weapon</i>

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.243
<i>designed by the U.S. and Israel</i>

01:21:24.245 --> 01:21:25.778
<i>fell into the hands of Russia</i>

01:21:26.313 --> 01:21:28.314
<i>and the very country it was meant to attack.</i>

01:21:31.056 --> 01:21:35.266
They managed to create minor
problems for a few of our centrifuges

01:21:35.644 --> 01:21:39.774
through the software that they
had installed on electronic parts.

01:21:40.733 --> 01:21:43.113
It was a naughty and immoral move by them

01:21:43.318 --> 01:21:45.988
but fortunately our experts discovered it

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.910
and today they are not capable
of ever doing it again.

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:52.405
Kiyaei: <i> In international law,</i>

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:55.941
<i>when some country or a coalition of countries</i>

01:21:56.176 --> 01:22:00.646
targets a nuclear facility, it's a act of war.

01:22:01.548 --> 01:22:04.450
Please, let's be frank here.

01:22:05.118 --> 01:22:07.820
If it wasn't Iran,

01:22:08.455 --> 01:22:11.157
let's say a nuclear facility in United States...

01:22:12.426 --> 01:22:14.160
Was targeted in the same way...

01:22:16.363 --> 01:22:17.997
The American government

01:22:18.398 --> 01:22:21.133
would not sit by and let this go.

01:22:21.968 --> 01:22:24.537
Gibney: STUXnet is an attack in peacetime

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.659
on critical infrastructures.

01:22:25.806 --> 01:22:28.908
Yes, it is. I'm... look, when I read about it,

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:31.610
I read it, I go, "whoa, this is a big deal."

01:22:31.612 --> 01:22:33.345
Yeah.

01:22:35.048 --> 01:22:37.583
Sanger: <i>The people who were running this program,</i>

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:39.051
<i>including Leon Panetta,</i>

01:22:39.053 --> 01:22:41.053
<i>the Director of the CIA at the time,</i>

01:22:41.655 --> 01:22:44.290
<i>had to go down into the Situation Room</i>

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.492
<i>and face President Obama,</i>

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:50.029
<i>Vice President Biden and explain that this program</i>

01:22:50.297 --> 01:22:52.865
<i>was suddenly on the loose.</i>

01:22:54.167 --> 01:22:55.668
Vice President Biden,

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:58.237
at one point during this discussion,

01:22:59.072 --> 01:23:01.774
sort of exploded in Biden-esque fashion

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.342
<i>and blamed the Israelis.</i>

01:23:03.344 --> 01:23:05.744
<i>He said, "it must have been the Israelis</i>

01:23:05.746 --> 01:23:07.813
<i>who made a change in the code</i>

01:23:07.815 --> 01:23:09.915
<i>that enabled it to get out."</i>

01:23:11.785 --> 01:23:13.986
Richard Clarke: <i>President Obama said to the senior leadership,</i>

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:17.022
<i>"you told me it wouldn't get out of the network. It did.</i>

01:23:17.024 --> 01:23:19.191
You told me the Iranians would never figure out

01:23:19.193 --> 01:23:21.160
it was the United States. They did.

01:23:21.461 --> 01:23:23.162
You told me it would have a huge affect

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:26.832
on their nuclear program, and it didn't."

01:23:28.535 --> 01:23:32.037
Sanger: <i>The Natanz plant is inspected every couple of weeks</i>

01:23:32.339 --> 01:23:35.541
<i>by the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.</i>

01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:38.677
<i>And if you line up what you know about the attacks</i>

01:23:38.945 --> 01:23:41.847
<i>with the inspection reports, you can see the effects.</i>

01:23:43.183 --> 01:23:45.384
Heinonen: <i>If you go to the IAEA reports,</i>

01:23:45.386 --> 01:23:47.653
<i>they really show that all of those centrifuges</i>

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:50.556
<i>were switched off and they were removed.</i>

01:23:51.157 --> 01:23:54.527
<i>As much as almost couple of thousand got compromised.</i>

01:23:55.695 --> 01:23:57.162
When you put this altogether,

01:23:57.164 --> 01:23:59.965
I wouldn't be surprised if their program got delayed

01:23:59.967 --> 01:24:01.133
by the one year.

01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:05.304
<i>But go then to year 2012-13</i>

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:08.607
<i>and looking how the centrifuges started to come up again.</i>

01:24:08.875 --> 01:24:10.476
Kiyaei: <i>Iran's number of centrifuges</i>

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.344
<i>went up exponentially,</i>

01:24:12.346 --> 01:24:16.415
to 20,000, with a stockpile of low enriched uranium.

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:18.717
This isn't... these are high numbers.

01:24:19.586 --> 01:24:22.054
<i>Iran's nuclear facilities expanded</i>

01:24:22.056 --> 01:24:24.657
<i>with the construction of Fordow</i>

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:27.259
<i>and other highly protected facilities.</i>

01:24:29.329 --> 01:24:32.097
So ironically, cyber warfare...

01:24:32.899 --> 01:24:35.501
Assassination of its nuclear scientists,

01:24:35.936 --> 01:24:39.204
economic sanctions, political isolation...

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.576
<i>Iran has gone through "a" to "x"</i>

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:48.180
<i>of every chorus of policy that the U.S., Israel,</i>

01:24:48.182 --> 01:24:52.318
<i>and those who ally with them have placed on Iran,</i>

01:24:52.852 --> 01:24:55.788
and they have actually made Iran's nuclear program

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.524
more advanced today than it was ever before.

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:04.430
Mossad Operative: <i>This is a very</i>

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:07.566
<i>very dangerous minefield that we are walking,</i>

01:25:07.568 --> 01:25:10.469
and nations who decide

01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:12.671
to take these covert actions

01:25:13.807 --> 01:25:16.842
should be taking into consideration

01:25:17.477 --> 01:25:22.281
all the effects, including the moral effects.

01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:26.952
I would say that this is the price

01:25:26.954 --> 01:25:31.290
that we have to pay in this... in this war,

01:25:31.625 --> 01:25:34.159
and our blade of righteousness

01:25:34.161 --> 01:25:35.561
shouldn't be so sharp.

01:25:41.401 --> 01:25:43.802
Gibney: <i>In Israel and in the United States,</i>

01:25:43.804 --> 01:25:46.138
<i>the blade of righteousness cut both ways,</i>

01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:49.208
<i>wounding the targets and the attackers.</i>

01:25:50.276 --> 01:25:52.678
<i>When STUXnet infected American computers,</i>

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.747
<i>the Department of Homeland Security,</i>

01:25:55.081 --> 01:25:58.017
<i>unaware of the cyber weapons launch by the NSA,</i>

01:25:58.284 --> 01:26:01.453
<i>devoted enormous resources trying to protect Americans</i>

01:26:01.455 --> 01:26:02.755
<i>from their own government.</i>

01:26:03.256 --> 01:26:05.691
<i>We had met the enemy and it was us.</i>

01:26:11.464 --> 01:26:13.132
Seán Paul McGurk: <i>The purpose of the watch stations that</i>

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:15.300
<i>you see in front of you is to aggregate the data</i>

01:26:15.302 --> 01:26:16.769
- <i>coming in from multiple feeds</i>

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.504
<i>of what the cyber threats could be,</i>

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:19.938
so if we see threats

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.508
we can provide real-time recommendations

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.744
<i>for both private companies, as well as federal agencies.</i>

01:26:26.479 --> 01:26:28.233
Male journalist:

01:26:28.233 --> 01:26:30.108
Can you give us a readout
on this Stuxnet virus?

01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:32.785
Yep, absolutely. We'd be more than happy to discuss that.

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:33.852
Female journalist: Seán, is it...

01:26:33.854 --> 01:26:36.455
McGurk: <i>Early July of 2010 we received a call</i>

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:39.058
<i>that said that this piece of malware was discovered</i>

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.459
<i>and could we take a look at it.</i>

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:43.562
When we first started the analysis,

01:26:43.564 --> 01:26:45.898
there was that "oh, crap" moment, you know,

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.733
where we sat there and said, this is something

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:48.867
that's significant.

01:26:48.869 --> 01:26:50.602
It's impacting industrial control.

01:26:50.837 --> 01:26:53.305
It can disrupt it to the point where it could cause harm

01:26:53.307 --> 01:26:55.374
and not only damage to the equipment,

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.443
but potentially harm or loss of life.

01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:00.412
<i>We were very concerned because STUXnet</i>

01:27:00.414 --> 01:27:02.181
<i>was something that we had not seen before.</i>

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.316
<i>So there wasn't a lot of sleep that night.</i>

01:27:04.318 --> 01:27:07.219
<i>Basically, light up the phones, call everybody we know,</i>

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:10.456
<i>inform the secretary, inform the White House,</i>

01:27:10.657 --> 01:27:12.725
<i>inform the other departments and agencies,</i>

01:27:12.892 --> 01:27:15.594
<i>wake up the world, and figure out what's going on</i>

01:27:15.596 --> 01:27:17.796
<i>with this particular malware.</i>

01:27:19.599 --> 01:27:20.866
Good morning, Chairman Lieberman,

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.134
ranking member Collins.

01:27:22.702 --> 01:27:24.503
Something as simple and innocuous as this

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:26.672
becomes a challenge for all of us to maintain

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:29.641
accountability control of our critical infrastructure systems.

01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:32.244
This actually contains the STUXnet virus.

01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:33.912
I've been asked on a number of occasions,

01:27:33.914 --> 01:27:35.748
"did you ever think this was us?"

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:39.451
And at... at no point did that ever really cross our mind,

01:27:39.453 --> 01:27:42.254
because we were looking at it from the standpoint of,

01:27:42.589 --> 01:27:44.556
is this something that's coming after the homeland?

01:27:44.558 --> 01:27:47.126
You know, what... what's going to potentially impact,

01:27:47.128 --> 01:27:49.928
you know, our industrial control
based here in the United States?

01:27:50.363 --> 01:27:53.298
You know, I liken it to, you know, field of battle.

01:27:53.466 --> 01:27:55.434
You don't think the sniper that's behind you

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:56.935
is gonna be shooting at you,

01:27:57.103 --> 01:27:58.743
'cause you expect him to be on your side.

01:27:59.239 --> 01:28:02.941
We really don't know who the attacker was

01:28:02.943 --> 01:28:04.343
in the STUXnet case.

01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:06.779
So help us understand a little more

01:28:07.046 --> 01:28:09.214
what this thing is

01:28:09.916 --> 01:28:15.320
whose origin and destination we don't understand.

01:28:16.556 --> 01:28:18.657
Gibney: Did anybody ever give you any indication

01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:20.826
that it was something that they already knew about?

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:23.562
No, at no time did I get the impression from someone

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.431
that that's okay, you know, get the little pat on the head,

01:28:26.433 --> 01:28:27.900
and... and scooted out the door.

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:29.768
I never received a stand-down order.

01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:33.405
I never... no one ever asked, "stop looking at this."

01:28:34.007 --> 01:28:37.810
Do we think that this was a nation-state actor

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:40.245
and that there are a limited number of nation-states

01:28:40.247 --> 01:28:43.649
that have such advanced capacity?

01:28:45.485 --> 01:28:47.753
Gibney: Seán McGurk, the Director of Cyber

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.488
for the Department of Homeland Security,

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.324
testified before the Senate about how he thought

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:55.427
STUXnet was a terrifying threat to the United States.

01:28:55.695 --> 01:28:56.962
Is that not a problem?

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.864
I don't... and... and how... how do you mean?

01:28:59.132 --> 01:29:01.533
That STUXnet was a bad idea?

01:29:01.935 --> 01:29:04.603
Gibney: No, no, no, just that before he knew what it was

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:06.438
- and what it attacks...
- Oh, I... I get it.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.840
- Gibney: Yeah...
- Yeah,

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.441
he was responding to something that we...

01:29:09.443 --> 01:29:09.943
Gibney: He thought it was a threat

01:29:10.777 --> 01:29:12.644
to critical infrastructure in the United States.

01:29:12.646 --> 01:29:14.346
Yeah. The worm is loose!

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:16.215
Gibney: The worm is loose. I understand.

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:19.218
But there's... there's a further theory

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.819
having to do with whether or not,

01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:23.055
following upon David Sanger...

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:24.957
I got the subplot, and who did that?

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.859
Was it the Israelis? And, yeah, I...

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:30.362
I truly don't know, and even though I don't know,

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:32.064
I still can't talk about it, all right?

01:29:32.365 --> 01:29:35.901
STUXnet was somebody's covert action, all right?

01:29:36.135 --> 01:29:37.803
And the definition of covert action

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:40.706
is an activity in which you want to have the hand

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:42.708
of the actor forever hidden.

01:29:43.076 --> 01:29:46.245
So by definition, it's gonna end up in this

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:48.146
"we don't talk about these things" box.

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:56.688
Sanger: <i>To this day, the United States government</i>

01:29:56.690 --> 01:29:58.824
<i>has never acknowledged</i>

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:03.295
<i>conducting any offensive cyber attack anywhere in the world.</i>

01:30:05.331 --> 01:30:10.235
<i>But thanks to Mr. Snowden, we know that in 2012</i>

01:30:10.237 --> 01:30:12.638
<i>President Obama issued an Executive Order</i>

01:30:12.839 --> 01:30:15.574
<i>that laid out some of the conditions</i>

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:18.043
<i>under which cyber weapons can be used.</i>

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:21.613
<i>And interestingly, every use of a cyber weapon</i>

01:30:21.615 --> 01:30:24.650
<i>requires presidential sign-off.</i>

01:30:25.885 --> 01:30:29.721
That is only true in the physical world

01:30:29.723 --> 01:30:31.590
for nuclear weapons.

01:30:42.902 --> 01:30:45.203
Clarke: <i>Nuclear war and nuclear weapons are vastly different</i>

01:30:45.205 --> 01:30:47.072
<i>from cyber war and cyber weapons.</i>

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:50.042
<i>Having said that, there are some similarities.</i>

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.444
<i>And in the early 1960s,</i>

01:30:52.879 --> 01:30:54.780
<i>the United States government suddenly realized</i>

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.848
<i>it had thousands of nuclear weapons,</i>

01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:58.717
<i>big ones and little ones,</i>

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:01.053
<i>weapons on jeeps, weapons on submarines,</i>

01:31:01.921 --> 01:31:04.056
and it really didn't have a doctrine.

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.891
It really didn't have a strategy.

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.659
It really didn't have an understanding

01:31:07.927 --> 01:31:10.062
at the policy level about how he was going to use

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:11.229
all of these things.

01:31:11.798 --> 01:31:13.799
And so academics

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:16.635
started publishing unclassified documents

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:20.505
about nuclear war and nuclear weapons.

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:24.242
Sanger: <i> And the result was</i>

01:31:24.610 --> 01:31:26.945
<i>more than 20 years, in the United States,</i>

01:31:26.947 --> 01:31:29.648
of very vigorous national debates

01:31:30.183 --> 01:31:33.719
<i>about how we want to go use nuclear weapons.</i>

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:39.358
And not only did that cause the Congress

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.760
and people in the executive branch in Washington

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.495
to think about these things,

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:46.765
it caused the Russians to think about these things.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.936
<i>And out of that grew nuclear doctrine,</i>

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:52.604
<i>mutual assured destruction,</i>

01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:57.743
<i>all of that complicated set of nuclear dynamics.</i>

01:31:58.344 --> 01:32:01.313
Today, on this vital issue at least,

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:03.382
we have seen what can be accomplished

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:05.050
when we pull together.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:09.221
We can't have that discussion in a sensible way right now

01:32:09.489 --> 01:32:11.556
about cyber war and cyber weapons

01:32:11.558 --> 01:32:12.924
because everything is secret.

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:17.062
And when you get into a discussion

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:20.165
with people in the government, people still in the government,

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.700
people who have security clearances,

01:32:21.968 --> 01:32:23.201
you run into a brick wall.

01:32:23.469 --> 01:32:24.803
Trying to stop Iran

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:28.140
is really the... my number one job, and I think...

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:29.541
Host: And let me ask you, in that context,

01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:31.576
about the STUXnet computer virus potentially...

01:32:31.578 --> 01:32:33.145
You can ask, but I won't comment.

01:32:34.214 --> 01:32:35.313
Host: Can you tell us anything?

01:32:35.315 --> 01:32:36.481
No.

01:32:36.483 --> 01:32:38.917
What do you think has had the most impact

01:32:38.919 --> 01:32:41.053
on their nuclear decision-making,

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:42.754
the STUXnet virus?

01:32:42.756 --> 01:32:45.023
I can't talk about STUXnet.

01:32:45.025 --> 01:32:49.428
I can't even talk about the operation of Iran centrifuges.

01:32:49.595 --> 01:32:51.830
Was the U.S. involved in any way

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.432
in the development of STUXnet?

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.601
It's hard to get into any kind of comment on that

01:32:56.603 --> 01:32:58.737
till we've finished any... our examination.

01:32:59.572 --> 01:33:00.906
But, sir, I'm not asking you

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.874
if you think another country was involved.

01:33:02.876 --> 01:33:04.876
I'm asking you if the U.S. was involved.

01:33:04.878 --> 01:33:07.245
And we're... this is not something

01:33:07.247 --> 01:33:09.207
that we're gonna be able to answer at this point.

01:33:09.549 --> 01:33:11.883
Look, for the longest time, I was in fear that

01:33:11.885 --> 01:33:13.385
I couldn't actually say the phrase

01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:15.053
"computer network attack."

01:33:15.055 --> 01:33:17.923
This stuff is hideously overclassified,

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:20.058
and it gets into the way of a...

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.861
Of a mature public discussion

01:33:22.863 --> 01:33:25.397
as to what it is we as a democracy

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:29.568
want our nation to be doing up here in the cyber domain.

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.404
Now, this is a former director of NSA and CIA

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:34.372
saying this stuff is overclassified.

01:33:34.607 --> 01:33:38.110
One of the reasons this is highly classified as it is

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:39.711
this is a peculiar weapons system.

01:33:39.713 --> 01:33:41.713
This is a weapons system that's come out of

01:33:41.715 --> 01:33:43.048
the espionage community,

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:46.318
and... and so those people have a habit of secrecy.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.620
Secrecy is still justifiable in certain cases

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:51.823
to protect sources or to protect national security

01:33:51.825 --> 01:33:54.993
but when we deal with secrecy, don't hide behind it

01:33:54.995 --> 01:33:58.930
to use as an excuse to not disclose something properly

01:33:58.932 --> 01:34:00.966
that you know should be

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:02.234
<i>or that the American people</i>

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:03.502
<i>need ultimately to see.</i>

01:34:06.172 --> 01:34:08.240
Gibney: <i>While most government officials refused</i>

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:09.708
<i>to acknowledge the operation,</i>

01:34:10.309 --> 01:34:13.078
<i>at least one key insider did leak parts of the story</i>

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.179
<i>to the press.</i>

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:18.083
<i>In 2012, David Sanger wrote a detailed account</i>

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:21.419
<i>of Olympic Games that unmasked the extensive joint operation</i>

01:34:21.421 --> 01:34:23.355
<i>between the U.S. and Israel</i>

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:25.590
<i>to launch cyber attacks on Natanz.</i>

01:34:26.459 --> 01:34:28.326
Sanger: <i>The publication of this story</i>

01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:30.362
coming at a time that turned out that there were

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:33.165
a number of other unrelated national security stories

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:35.834
being published, lead to the announcement

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:39.204
of investigations by the Attorney General.

01:34:39.672 --> 01:34:41.973
Gibney: In... into the press and into the leaks?

01:34:41.975 --> 01:34:43.508
Into the press and into the leaks.

01:34:45.978 --> 01:34:47.145
Gibney: <i>Soon after the article,</i>

01:34:47.147 --> 01:34:49.314
<i>the Obama administration targeted</i>

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:52.350
<i>General James Cartwright in a criminal investigation</i>

01:34:52.352 --> 01:34:53.618
<i>for allegedly leaking</i>

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.954
<i>classified details about STUXnet.</i>

01:34:57.323 --> 01:34:58.823
Journalist: There are reports of cyber attacks

01:34:58.825 --> 01:35:01.626
on the Iranian nuclear program that you ordered.

01:35:01.628 --> 01:35:03.128
What's your reaction to this information getting out?

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.729
Well, first of all, I'm not gonna comment on the...

01:35:04.731 --> 01:35:08.099
The details of... what are...

01:35:10.469 --> 01:35:14.773
Supposed to be classified items.

01:35:15.575 --> 01:35:17.943
<i>Since I've been in office, my attitude has been</i>

01:35:18.177 --> 01:35:21.446
<i>zero tolerance for these kinds of leaks.</i>

01:35:22.048 --> 01:35:23.715
We have mechanisms in place

01:35:24.016 --> 01:35:27.552
where, if we can root out folks who have leaked,

01:35:28.354 --> 01:35:29.788
they will suffer consequences.

01:35:30.156 --> 01:35:32.557
It became a significant issue

01:35:32.559 --> 01:35:34.826
and a very wide-ranging investigation

01:35:34.828 --> 01:35:37.262
in which I think most of the people who were cleared

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:38.830
for Olympic Games at some point

01:35:38.832 --> 01:35:40.699
had been, you know, interviewed and so forth.

01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:42.400
<i>When STUXnet hit the media,</i>

01:35:42.402 --> 01:35:44.603
<i>they polygraphed everyone in our office,</i>

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.204
<i>including people who didn't know shit.</i>

01:35:46.206 --> 01:35:48.340
<i>You know, they polyed the interns, for God's sake.</i>

01:35:48.874 --> 01:35:50.275
These are criminal acts

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:51.910
when they release information like this,

01:35:52.445 --> 01:35:56.281
and we will conduct thorough investigations

01:35:56.882 --> 01:35:58.650
as we have in the past.

01:36:00.686 --> 01:36:02.921
Gibney: <i>The administration never filed charges,</i>

01:36:03.256 --> 01:36:05.056
<i>possibly afraid that a prosecution</i>

01:36:05.058 --> 01:36:07.926
<i>would reveal classified details about STUXnet.</i>

01:36:08.861 --> 01:36:12.297
<i>To this day, no one in the U.S. or Israeli governments</i>

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:14.366
<i>has officially acknowledged the existence</i>

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:15.834
<i>of the joint operation.</i>

01:36:17.803 --> 01:36:19.271
<i>I would never compromise</i>

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:21.039
<i>ongoing operations in the field,</i>

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:25.110
<i>but we should be able to talk about capability.</i>

01:36:26.479 --> 01:36:27.979
<i>We can talk about our...</i>

01:36:29.115 --> 01:36:31.883
<i>Bunker busters, why not our cyber weapons?</i>

01:36:32.251 --> 01:36:33.318
<i>I mean, the secrecy</i>

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.020
<i>of the operation has been blown.</i>

01:36:36.555 --> 01:36:38.590
<i>Our friends in Israel took a weapon</i>

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:40.058
<i>that we jointly developed,</i>

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:42.193
<i>in part to keep Israel from doing something crazy,</i>

01:36:42.628 --> 01:36:44.429
<i>and then used it on their own in a way</i>

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:45.797
<i>that blew the cover of the operation</i>

01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:46.965
<i>and could have led to war.</i>

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.400
<i>And we can't talk about that?</i>

01:36:52.938 --> 01:36:55.018
Mowatt-Larssen: <i>There's a way to talk about STUXnet.</i>

01:36:55.408 --> 01:36:56.775
It happened.

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:59.644
That... to deny that it happened is... is foolish.

01:36:59.646 --> 01:37:01.579
So the fact it happened

01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:03.081
is really what we're talking about here.

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:04.916
What does... what are the implications

01:37:04.918 --> 01:37:07.752
of the fact that we now are in a post-STUXnet world?

01:37:08.254 --> 01:37:10.689
What I said to David Sanger was,

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:13.391
"I understand the difference in destruction is dramatic,

01:37:13.626 --> 01:37:16.094
but this has the whiff of August 1945."

01:37:16.929 --> 01:37:18.496
Somebody just used a new weapon,

01:37:18.864 --> 01:37:21.599
and this weapon will not be put back into the box.

01:37:22.034 --> 01:37:24.703
I... I know no operational details

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:27.639
and don't know what anyone did or didn't do

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:30.275
before someone decided to use the weapon, all right.

01:37:30.609 --> 01:37:31.843
I do know this.

01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:33.745
If we go out and do something,

01:37:34.513 --> 01:37:36.614
most of the rest of the world now thinks

01:37:36.816 --> 01:37:38.196
that's the new standard

01:37:38.384 --> 01:37:41.252
and it's something that they now feel legitimated to do as well.

01:37:42.655 --> 01:37:44.122
<i>But the rules of engagement,</i>

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:46.691
<i>international norms, treaty standards,</i>

01:37:46.693 --> 01:37:48.526
<i>they don't exist right now.</i>

01:37:52.365 --> 01:37:55.533
Brown: <i>The law of war, because it began to develop so long ago</i>

01:37:55.535 --> 01:37:59.104
<i>is really dependent on thinking of things kinetically</i>

01:37:59.472 --> 01:38:00.972
<i>and the physical realm.</i>

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.642
<i>So for example, we think in terms of attacks.</i>

01:38:05.578 --> 01:38:07.812
You know an attack when it happens in the kinetic world.

01:38:07.814 --> 01:38:09.547
<i>It's not really much of a mystery.</i>

01:38:09.549 --> 01:38:12.484
But in cyberspace it is sort of confusing to think,

01:38:13.052 --> 01:38:14.519
how far do we have to go

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.721
before something is considered an attack?

01:38:16.889 --> 01:38:20.658
So we have to take all the vocabulary

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.995
and the terms that we use in strategy

01:38:23.997 --> 01:38:25.630
and military operations

01:38:25.865 --> 01:38:28.933
and adapt them into the cyber realm.

01:38:30.269 --> 01:38:31.703
Sanger: <i>For nuclear we have these</i>

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:33.638
<i>extensive inspection regimes.</i>

01:38:33.939 --> 01:38:36.007
<i>The Russians come and look at our silos.</i>

01:38:36.342 --> 01:38:37.942
<i>We go and look at their silos.</i>

01:38:38.411 --> 01:38:40.412
<i>Bad as things get between the two countries,</i>

01:38:40.613 --> 01:38:42.514
those inspection regimes have held up.

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:45.417
But working that our for... for cyber

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.985
would be virtually impossible.

01:38:47.286 --> 01:38:48.653
Where do you send your inspector?

01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:51.089
Inside the laptop of, you know...

01:38:51.424 --> 01:38:53.784
How many laptops are there in the United States and Russia?

01:38:54.059 --> 01:38:56.261
It's much more difficult in the cyber area

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:58.596
to construct an international regime

01:38:58.598 --> 01:39:01.633
<i>based on treaty commitments and rules of the road</i>

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:02.801
<i>and so forth.</i>

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:06.104
<i>Although, we've tried to have discussions with the Chinese</i>

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:08.139
<i>and Russians and so forth about that,</i>

01:39:08.141 --> 01:39:09.507
<i>but it's very difficult.</i>

01:39:10.609 --> 01:39:14.112
Brown: <i>Right now, the norm in cyberspace is</i>

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.474
do whatever you can get away with.

01:39:16.449 --> 01:39:18.850
That's not a good norm, but it's the norm that we have.

01:39:19.418 --> 01:39:21.486
<i>That's the norm that's preferred by states</i>

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:24.122
<i>that are engaging in lots of different kinds of activities</i>

01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:26.364
<i>that they feel are benefitting their national security.</i>

01:39:27.393 --> 01:39:29.994
Yadlin: <i> Those who excel in cyber</i>

01:39:29.996 --> 01:39:32.797
are trying to slow down the process

01:39:32.799 --> 01:39:34.466
of creating regulation.

01:39:34.934 --> 01:39:38.770
Those who are victims we like the regulation

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:42.507
to be in the open as... as soon as possible.

01:39:44.677 --> 01:39:47.512
Brown: <i>International law in this area is written by custom,</i>

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:50.615
<i>and customary law requires a nation to say,</i>

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:52.497
<i>this is what we did and this is why we did it.</i>

01:39:53.152 --> 01:39:56.087
And the U.S. doesn't want to push the law in that direction

01:39:56.089 --> 01:39:58.523
and so it chooses not to disclose its involvement.

01:39:59.091 --> 01:40:01.292
And one of the reasons that I thought it was important

01:40:01.294 --> 01:40:04.162
to tell the story of Olympic Games

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.965
was not simply because it's a cool spy story,

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:10.201
it is, but it's because as a nation...

01:40:11.370 --> 01:40:14.939
We need to have a debate about how we want to use cyber weapons

01:40:15.174 --> 01:40:18.676
because we are the most vulnerable nation on earth

01:40:18.844 --> 01:40:20.678
to cyber-attack ourselves.

01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:27.151
McGurk: <i>If you get up in the morning and turn off your alarm</i>

01:40:27.153 --> 01:40:31.523
<i>and make coffee and pump gas and use the ATM,</i>

01:40:32.057 --> 01:40:33.858
<i>you've touched industrial control systems.</i>

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:35.527
<i>It's what powers our lives.</i>

01:40:35.861 --> 01:40:38.496
And unfortunately, these systems are connected

01:40:38.498 --> 01:40:42.166
and interconnected in some ways that make them vulnerable.

01:40:42.168 --> 01:40:44.903
Critical infrastructure systems generally were built

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:47.539
years and years and years ago without security in mind

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.641
and they didn't realize how things were gonna change,

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:51.876
maybe they weren't even meant to be connected to the Internet.

01:40:51.878 --> 01:40:54.979
And we've seen, through a lot of experimentation

01:40:54.981 --> 01:40:57.615
and through also, unfortunately, a lot of attacks

01:40:57.917 --> 01:41:00.251
that most of these systems are relatively easy

01:41:00.253 --> 01:41:02.921
for a sophisticated hacker to get into.

01:41:04.891 --> 01:41:06.691
<i>Let's say you took over the control system</i>

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:09.427
<i>of a railway. You could switch tracks.</i>

01:41:09.895 --> 01:41:12.196
<i>You could cause derailments of trains</i>

01:41:12.198 --> 01:41:13.998
<i>carrying explosive materials.</i>

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.436
<i>What if you were in the control system of gas pipelines</i>

01:41:18.771 --> 01:41:21.339
<i>and when a valve was supposed to be open,</i>

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:24.008
<i>it was closed and the pressure built up</i>

01:41:24.209 --> 01:41:25.743
<i>and the pipeline exploded?</i>

01:41:26.712 --> 01:41:30.648
There are companies that run electric power generation

01:41:31.050 --> 01:41:32.951
or electric power distribution

01:41:33.218 --> 01:41:35.253
<i>that we know have been hacked</i>

01:41:35.621 --> 01:41:38.056
<i>by foreign entities that have the ability</i>

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:39.691
<i>to shut down the power grid.</i>

01:41:40.259 --> 01:41:42.360
Sanger: <i> Imagine for a moment</i>

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:45.129
<i>that not only all the power went off on the east coast,</i>

01:41:45.431 --> 01:41:47.465
<i>but the entire Internet came down.</i>

01:41:48.133 --> 01:41:50.668
Imagine what the economic impact of that is

01:41:51.136 --> 01:41:53.271
even if it only lasted for 24 hours.

01:41:55.641 --> 01:41:57.308
Newsreader: <i>According to the officials,</i>

01:41:57.310 --> 01:42:00.545
<i>Iran is the first country ever in the Middle East</i>

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.047
<i>to actually be engaged in a cyber war</i>

01:42:03.049 --> 01:42:05.249
<i>with the United States and Israel.</i>

01:42:05.251 --> 01:42:08.620
<i>If anything they said the recent cyber attacks</i>

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.788
<i>were what encouraged them to plan to set up</i>

01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:14.125
<i>the cyber Army, which will gather computer scientists,</i>

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:16.961
<i>programmers, software engineers...</i>

01:42:16.963 --> 01:42:19.897
Kiyaei: <i>If you are a youth and you see assassination</i>

01:42:19.899 --> 01:42:21.532
<i>of a nuclear scientist,</i>

01:42:21.934 --> 01:42:24.402
your nuclear facilities are getting attacked,

01:42:25.104 --> 01:42:28.406
wouldn't you join your national cyber Army?

01:42:29.108 --> 01:42:30.408
Well, many did.

01:42:30.676 --> 01:42:33.845
And that's why today, Iran has one of the largest...

01:42:35.014 --> 01:42:37.415
Cyber armies in the world.

01:42:37.916 --> 01:42:40.318
So whoever initiated this

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.820
and was very proud of themselves to see that little dip

01:42:43.322 --> 01:42:47.558
in Iran's centrifuge numbers, should look back now

01:42:48.027 --> 01:42:51.596
and acknowledge that it was a major mistake.

01:42:52.197 --> 01:42:55.433
Very quickly, Iran sent a message

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:59.137
to the United States, very sophisticated message,

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:01.939
and they did that with two attacks.

01:43:02.608 --> 01:43:05.410
<i>First, they attacked Saudi Aramco,</i>

01:43:05.711 --> 01:43:07.679
<i>the biggest oil company in the world,</i>

01:43:08.013 --> 01:43:10.715
<i>and wiped out every piece of software,</i>

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:15.119
<i>every line of code, on 30,000 computer devices.</i>

01:43:16.488 --> 01:43:22.060
Then Iran did a surge attack on the American banks.

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:24.996
The most extensive attack on American banks ever

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:27.832
launched from the Middle East, happening right now.

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.154

NSA source: <i>When Iran hit our banks,</i>

01:43:43.416 --> 01:43:45.817
<i>we could have shut down their botnet,</i>

01:43:45.819 --> 01:43:47.985
<i>but the state department got nervous,</i>

01:43:48.187 --> 01:43:50.888
<i>because the servers weren't actually in Iran.</i>

01:43:51.557 --> 01:43:53.891
<i>So until there was a diplomatic solution,</i>

01:43:54.326 --> 01:43:56.961
<i>Obama let the private sector deal with the problem.</i>

01:43:57.563 --> 01:44:00.498
I imagine that in the White House Situation Room

01:44:00.833 --> 01:44:02.900
people sat around and said...

01:44:03.569 --> 01:44:06.604
Let me be clear, I don't imagine, I know.

01:44:06.939 --> 01:44:09.507
People sat around in the White House Situation Room

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:12.543
and said, "the Iranians have sent us a message

01:44:12.545 --> 01:44:16.781
which is essentially, 'stop attacking us in cyberspace

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:19.317
the way you did at Natanz with STUXnet.

01:44:19.752 --> 01:44:21.119
We can do it, too.'"

Melman: <i>There are unintended consequences</i>

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:27.658
<i>of the STUXnet attack.</i>

01:44:28.093 --> 01:44:31.863
You wanted to cause confusion and damage to the other side,

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:34.632
but then the other side can do the same to you.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:38.302
<i>The monster turned against its creators,</i>

01:44:38.304 --> 01:44:40.705
<i>and now everyone is in this game.</i>

01:44:41.607 --> 01:44:44.075
They did a good job in showing the world,

01:44:44.077 --> 01:44:47.478
including the bad guys, what you would need to do

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.614
in order to cause serious trouble

01:44:49.882 --> 01:44:52.383
that could lead to injuries and death.

01:44:52.651 --> 01:44:55.453
It's inevitable that more countries will acquire

01:44:55.455 --> 01:44:57.755
the capacity to use cyber,

01:44:57.757 --> 01:45:01.225
<i>both for espionage and for destructive activities.</i>

01:45:01.994 --> 01:45:04.328
<i>And we've seen this in some of the recent conflicts</i>

01:45:04.330 --> 01:45:05.797
<i>that Russia's been involved in.</i>

01:45:05.998 --> 01:45:08.666
<i>If there's a war, then somebody will try to knock out</i>

<i>It could be for communications purposes.</i>

01:45:18.478 --> 01:45:20.678
<i>It could be for data exfiltration.</i>

01:45:20.946 --> 01:45:24.549
It could be to, you know, Shepherd in the next STUXnet.

<i>I mean, you've been focusing on STUXnet,</i>

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.352
<i>but that was just a small part</i>

01:45:28.354 --> 01:45:30.521
<i>of a much larger Iranian mission.</i>

01:45:31.256 --> 01:45:32.976
Gibney: <i>There was a larger Iranian mission?</i>

<i>Nitro Zeus. NZ.</i>

01:45:40.632 --> 01:45:44.836
<i>We spent hundreds of millions, maybe billions on it.</i>

<i>In the event the Israelis did attack Iran,</i>

01:45:51.010 --> 01:45:53.678
<i>we assumed we would be drawn into the conflict.</i>

01:45:55.047 --> 01:45:58.516
<i>We built in attacks on Iran's command-and-control system</i>

01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:00.885
<i>so the Iranians couldn't talk to each other in a fight.</i>

01:46:01.386 --> 01:46:04.922
<i>We infiltrated their iads, military air defense systems,</i>

01:46:05.224 --> 01:46:07.464
<i>so they couldn't shoot down our planes if we flew over.</i>

01:46:08.026 --> 01:46:11.128
<i>We also went after their civilian support systems,</i>

01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:13.698
<i>power grids, transportation,</i>

01:46:14.066 --> 01:46:16.868
<i>communications, financial systems.</i>

01:46:17.469 --> 01:46:20.771
<i>We were inside waiting, watching,</i>

01:46:21.039 --> 01:46:24.041
<i>ready to disrupt, degrade, and destroy those systems</i>

01:46:24.043 --> 01:46:25.376
<i>with cyber-attacks.</i>

01:46:29.014 --> 01:46:30.481
<i>And in comparison,</i>

01:46:30.716 --> 01:46:32.950
<i>STUXnet was a back alley operation.</i>

01:46:34.086 --> 01:46:37.588
<i>NZ was the plan for a full-scale cyber war</i>

01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:39.457
<i>with no attribution.</i>

01:46:40.225 --> 01:46:41.726
The question is, is that the kind of world

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:42.868
we want to live in?

01:46:43.262 --> 01:46:47.031
And if we don't, as citizens, how do we go about a process

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:49.033
where we have a more sane discussion?

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:51.435
We need an entirely new way of thinking about

01:46:51.437 --> 01:46:53.004
how we're gonna solve this problem.

01:46:53.939 --> 01:46:56.073
You're not going to get an entirely new way

01:46:56.075 --> 01:46:57.475
of solving this problem

01:46:57.776 --> 01:47:00.578
until you begin to have an open acknowledgement

01:47:01.079 --> 01:47:03.414
that we have cyber weapons as well,

01:47:04.283 --> 01:47:07.318
and that we may have to agree to some limits on their use

01:47:07.853 --> 01:47:10.187
if we're going to get other nations to limit their use.

01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:11.756
It's not gonna be a one-way street.

01:47:11.957 --> 01:47:14.625
I'm old enough to have worked on nuclear arms control

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.461
and biological weapons arms control

01:47:17.463 --> 01:47:19.630
and chemical weapons arms control.

01:47:20.799 --> 01:47:25.269
And I was told in each of those types of arms control,

01:47:25.271 --> 01:47:26.604
when we were beginning,

01:47:26.905 --> 01:47:29.874
"it's too hard. There are all these problems.

01:47:30.142 --> 01:47:32.243
It's technical. There's engineering.

01:47:32.245 --> 01:47:33.911
There's science involved.

01:47:33.913 --> 01:47:36.247
There are real verification difficulties.

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:37.782
You'll never get there."

01:47:38.216 --> 01:47:40.618
Well, it took 20, 30 years in some cases,

01:47:41.053 --> 01:47:42.820
but we have a biological weapons treaty

01:47:42.822 --> 01:47:44.221
that's pretty damn good.

01:47:44.223 --> 01:47:45.723
We have a chemical weapons treaty

01:47:45.725 --> 01:47:47.124
that's pretty damn good.

01:47:47.292 --> 01:47:49.627
We've got three or four nuclear weapons treaties.

01:47:49.928 --> 01:47:51.529
Yes, it may be hard,

01:47:51.797 --> 01:47:53.898
and it may take 20 or 30 years,

01:47:54.299 --> 01:47:56.867
but it'll never happen unless you get serious about it,

01:47:57.336 --> 01:47:59.303
and it'll never happen unless you start it.

01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:08.079
Today, after two years of negotiations,

01:48:08.513 --> 01:48:11.816
the United States, together with our international partners,

01:48:12.284 --> 01:48:15.686
has achieved something that decades of animosity has not,

01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:18.222
a comprehensive, long-term deal

01:48:18.657 --> 01:48:22.326
with Iran that will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

01:48:22.527 --> 01:48:24.996
It was reached in Lausanne, Switzerland,

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:27.498
by Iran, the U.S., Britain, France,

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.433
Germany, Russia, and China.

01:48:29.435 --> 01:48:32.536
It is a deal in which Iran will cut

01:48:32.538 --> 01:48:36.741
its installed centrifuges by more than two thirds.

01:48:36.942 --> 01:48:40.177
Iran will not enrich uranium with its advanced centrifuges

01:48:40.179 --> 01:48:42.179
for at least the next ten years.

01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:44.815
It will make our country, our allies,

01:48:44.817 --> 01:48:46.450
and our world safer.

01:48:47.352 --> 01:48:51.355
Netanyahu: Seventy years after the murder of 6 million Jews

01:48:51.357 --> 01:48:56.427
Iran's rulers promised to destroy my country,

01:48:56.728 --> 01:49:00.464
and the response from nearly every one of the governments

01:49:00.466 --> 01:49:04.535
represented here has been utter silence.

01:49:05.170 --> 01:49:06.971
Deafening silence.

01:49:14.679 --> 01:49:16.747
Perhaps you can now understand

01:49:17.482 --> 01:49:20.985
why Israel is not joining you in celebrating this deal.

01:49:22.154 --> 01:49:24.555
History shows that America must lead,

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:27.491
not just with our might, but with our principles.

01:49:28.427 --> 01:49:31.595
It shows we're are stronger, not when we are alone,

01:49:31.597 --> 01:49:33.764
but when we bring the world together.

01:49:34.933 --> 01:49:37.201
Today's announcement marks one more chapter

01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:41.472
in this pursuit of a safer and more helpful,

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.176
more hopeful world. Thank you.

01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:48.946
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:55.119
NSA source: <i>Everyone I know is basically</i>

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.654
<i>thrilled with the Iran deal.</i>

01:49:57.222 --> 01:49:59.090
<i>Sanctions and diplomacy worked.</i>

01:49:59.458 --> 01:50:01.725
<i>But behind that deal was a lot of confidence</i>

01:50:01.727 --> 01:50:03.327
<i>in our cyber capability.</i>

01:50:04.396 --> 01:50:07.264
<i>We were everywhere inside Iran. Still are.</i>

01:50:08.133 --> 01:50:10.367
<i>I'm not gonna tell you the operational details</i>

01:50:10.369 --> 01:50:13.003
<i>of what we can do going forward or where...</i>

01:50:14.539 --> 01:50:18.642
<i>But the science fiction cyber war scenario is here.</i>

01:50:18.644 --> 01:50:20.111
<i>That's Nitro Zeus.</i>

01:50:21.546 --> 01:50:24.215
<i>But my concern and the reason I'm talking...</i>

01:50:25.717 --> 01:50:28.652
<i>Is because when you shut down a country's power grid...</i>

01:50:29.955 --> 01:50:32.923
<i>It doesn't just pop back up, you know?</i>

01:50:32.925 --> 01:50:34.725
<i>It's more like humpty-dumpty...</i>

01:50:36.094 --> 01:50:39.964
<i>And if all the king's men can't turn the lights back on</i>

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.866
<i>or filter the water for weeks,</i>

01:50:42.067 --> 01:50:43.968
<i>then lots of people die.</i>

01:50:46.238 --> 01:50:48.172
<i>And something we can do to others,</i>

01:50:48.473 --> 01:50:50.007
<i>they can do to us too.</i>

01:50:51.409 --> 01:50:54.078
<i>Is that something that we should keep quiet?</i>

01:50:55.247 --> 01:50:56.914
<i>Or should we talk about it?</i>

01:50:57.849 --> 01:50:59.750
Gibney: <i>I've gone to many people in this film,</i>

01:50:59.752 --> 01:51:01.519
<i>even friends of mine, who won't talk to me</i>

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:03.687
<i>about the NSA or STUXnet even off the record</i>

01:51:03.689 --> 01:51:04.989
<i>for fear of going to jail.</i>

01:51:05.357 --> 01:51:07.158
<i>Is that fear protecting us?</i>

01:51:08.326 --> 01:51:10.928
<i>No, but it protects me.</i>

01:51:11.696 --> 01:51:13.097
<i>Or should I say we?</i>

01:51:14.432 --> 01:51:16.167
I'm an actor playing a role

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:18.302
written from the testimony of a small number of people

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:19.837
from NSA and CIA,

01:51:20.172 --> 01:51:22.540
all of whom are angry about the secrecy

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:24.275
but too scared to come forward.

01:51:24.609 --> 01:51:26.043
Now, we're forward.

01:51:27.312 --> 01:51:30.114
Well, forward-leaning.
