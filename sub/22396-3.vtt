00:08.874 --> 00:10.374
Look, a wishing well!

00:14.915 --> 00:16.457
- Wanna know a secret?
- Ah-hah.

00:16.457 --> 00:18.333
Well, I'm not gonna tell.

00:18.333 --> 00:23.457
<i>♪ But, we are standing
by a wishing well.</i>

00:23.957 --> 00:26.541
<i>♪ Make a wish into the well</i>

00:27.790 --> 00:30.582
<i>♪ that's all you have to do</i>

00:30.582 --> 00:32.915
<i>♪ and if you hear it echoing...</i>

00:34.083 --> 00:37.541
<i>♪ Your wish will soon come true</i>

00:38.582 --> 00:39.749
<i>♪ I'm wishing...</i>

00:39.749 --> 00:41.790

00:47.083 --> 00:49.457
<i>♪ today</i>

00:50.083 --> 00:52.416
<i>♪ todaaaay!</i>

00:56.041 --> 00:57.374
The wishes are gone!

00:57.374 --> 00:59.499
Not the wishes!

00:59.499 --> 01:01.208
If those coins don't stay in that well,

01:01.208 --> 01:02.832
our wishes won't come true.

01:02.832 --> 01:05.124
In fact, nobody's wishes will!

01:06.457 --> 01:08.499
We have to get them back!

01:12.333 --> 01:13.333
What happened?

01:13.333 --> 01:14.874
I tripped on a dwarf.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.707
- I'll trip on the dwarf too!
- No.

01:16.707 --> 01:18.333
- Sit on a dwarf?
- No.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.416
Lick on a dwarf?

01:19.416 --> 01:22.374
Awww, gosh.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.832
Mickey, go get the wishes.

01:23.832 --> 01:25.124
I'll calm the crowd.

01:25.124 --> 01:26.416
Oh yeah! Right!

01:30.083 --> 01:31.624
Ugh...

01:33.499 --> 01:36.499
Oh, baby, you're mine, all mine.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.832
Not for long, you rotten wish burglar!

01:38.832 --> 01:39.832
Oh, no!

01:39.832 --> 01:41.582
Wha... whaaaa!

01:43.124 --> 01:44.499
Whoa!

01:47.874 --> 01:49.124
Whoa!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.666
Koochie-koochie-koo!

01:57.666 --> 01:59.000
Oh, haha, ha...

01:59.000 --> 02:00.166
Oooooh!

02:00.166 --> 02:01.541
Mwah ha ha ha!

02:02.832 --> 02:04.041
Rrraaaugh!

02:06.166 --> 02:07.582
Wa-ha ha ha!

02:09.624 --> 02:11.874
The wishes! Eergh!

02:21.374 --> 02:24.707
I think everybody
needs a big spoonful of sugar.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.874
You need to wish upon a star.

02:26.874 --> 02:28.666
A dream is a wish your heart makes.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.000
- Bippity boppity...
- boo!

02:31.957 --> 02:33.666
On to victory!

02:35.457 --> 02:37.208
Ha, ha, ha.

02:37.832 --> 02:39.041
Huh?

02:44.416 --> 02:45.499
Whoa!

02:51.582 --> 02:55.000
Where's my wish?
I want my wish!

02:55.000 --> 02:57.416
Oh, Mickey, bring those wishes...

02:57.416 --> 02:59.333
You go it, toots!

03:02.374 --> 03:04.041
Oh Mickey, you did it!

03:06.000 --> 03:07.166
Yipee!

03:14.083 --> 03:19.333
Oh Mickey, you made
everyone's wish come true.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.541
And you're my wish come true.
