01:20.080 --> 01:21.786
This is kabc radio.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.739
I'm geri Nichols.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.701
Latest crime statistics,
released today, show an alarming

01:26.920 --> 01:28.660
rise in violence.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.840
In the last five years, homicides
in Los Angeles county are up 79%.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.259
Robberies are up 68%.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.837
Aggravated assault,
another violent crime,

01:39.057 --> 01:41.639
shows an increase of 599,,

01:41.852 --> 01:46.095
rapes have increased 61%
and lesser crimes are up, too.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.646
Today I spoke to Los Angeles

01:47.858 --> 01:50.019
police commissioner,
Herman Baldwin.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.692
The fear of crime has
brought a deterioration

01:52.904 --> 01:54.360
of our community.

01:54.573 --> 01:58.782
It's almost as if we've
been struck by enemy bombs.

01:58.994 --> 02:02.157
The number of citizens
killed and maimed by criminal

02:02.372 --> 02:06.285
violence has produced in me
a great and personal resolve.

02:06.501 --> 02:10.494
The only way we're going to win,
and make no mistake, this is a war.

02:10.714 --> 02:13.797
The only way we'll win is
by assuming the offensive.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.876
Positive policing is the answer.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.336
We've got to deploy all our resources

02:19.556 --> 02:23.094
or criminal violence will
destroy our community.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.846
But what are the resources needed

02:25.062 --> 02:27.895
to diminish the
alarming rise in crimes.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.722
There are those who say
heavier prison sentences

02:30.942 --> 02:33.183
and an increased police
facility are enough.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.768
Yeah, I'm one of them.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.821
There are others who believe
that prison never cured anyone.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.400
And, judging by the rise in violence,
it never deterred anyone either.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.281
Here comes the commercial.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.158
Dr. Irving Clark...

02:45.374 --> 02:48.582
I know it's your radio station,
and I sure like miss Nichols,

02:48.794 --> 02:50.250
but I can't take this.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.827
It's not my radio station,

02:52.047 --> 02:54.038
I'm only the architect
for the new one.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.542
Miss Nichols is late.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.545
She's still on the radio.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.547
They recorded that earlier.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.137
Hey, there she is now.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.589
Don't be late for dinner.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.289
Your daughter sure ate
well last time.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.768
- That's 'cause you're a great cook.
- For her, nothing is too much.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.561
We won't be late.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.725
We were supposed to be there at 10:30.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.105
We'll make it.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.108
The senator's aide would
not get off the phone.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.906
Oh, and Los Angeles magazine's
gone for my idea

03:22.119 --> 03:24.781
of a series of articles on
criminal rehabilitation.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.452
That's great.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.830
Hello, baby.
You look really good.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.632
Hi, Carol, we're
not late, are we?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.846
Has there been any
progress this week, doctor?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.800
Nurse tells me she asked
for dinner on Thursday night.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.351
That's the fifth week running
she's said a few words.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.726
That's not much after two years.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.984
Will she ever come back to me?

03:58.196 --> 04:00.562
Will she ever be normal again?

04:00.782 --> 04:02.818
You're her father, Mr. kersey.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.150
You can only give her your love.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.826
And your prayers, too.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.418
I remember you liked
kites when you were a kid.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.291
Do you still like 'em?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.687
We haven't bought
you your ice cream yet.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.894
You mean we haven't
bought your ice cream yet.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.229
A man has to have some vices.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.277
But I'll tell you what.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.449
You choose whatever
vou want from this table.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.368
And I'll go off and
buy the ice cream.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.961
Look at him.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.674
So, what he look like?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.557
Let's do it.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.566
- Out the way, motherfucker.
- Get out the way!

05:25.826 --> 05:27.282
Watch out, asshole!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.073
Go get your ice cream, man.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.871
Asshole.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.170
Hey!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.082
They got his wallet!

05:45.470 --> 05:46.801
It's nice.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.496
- Where's my wallet?
- I ain't got it.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.023
Guess what?

06:39.107 --> 06:42.099
I got up to the front of the line and
discovered I'd forgotten my wallet.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.105
This time you two come with me.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.562
But I'm gonna have
to borrow some money.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.272
I think we can manage that.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.073
Carol, where have you been?

06:55.457 --> 06:57.057
I haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.823
I thought you'd deserted me.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.709
What happened, Paul?

07:02.631 --> 07:03.791
Nothing.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.002
Well you didn't forget your wallet.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.753
You never forget anything.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.459
I'll tell you about it later.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.712
I could stay.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.923
I could do the
interview another time.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.433
The senator's
only here for a day.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.012
If I were you, I wouldn't
miss the opportunity.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.563
- I'll see you at dinner, okay?
- Okay.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.061
Hey, Paul.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.767
You coming aboard?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.867
This is the place.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.219
Super fine.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.683
- Easy, my man.
- We got business.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.505
Mike, I thought
you weren't coming.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.385
You know I wouldn't.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.766
Have you told Jenny? =t will.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.567
Who is it?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.694
I've got a delivery
for Mr. kersey.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.322
Who from?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.498
Who is this delivery from?

09:48.046 --> 09:50.287
I can't rub out ten
years of a marriage.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.748
Like it never happened.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.332
I've got to think
of the children.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.480
Come on! =no!

10:13.321 --> 10:14.936
Just her, no one else here.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.823
We wanted to give Mr.
Kersey his wallet back.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.734
Personally.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.660
Hey, man, look at that.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.908
Isn't that pretty?

10:26.126 --> 10:29.960
No! No! No!

10:32.841 --> 10:36.208
Lady, you disturb the neighbors
and I'm gonna cut you into little pieces

10:36.427 --> 10:38.383
and eat you for dinner.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.990
Hey jiver,
save some for me, man!

11:15.258 --> 11:16.668
Ah, oh, oh, yeah.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.757
Getting it good
jiver, getting it good.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.688
My turn now, man.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.618
Take her in the bedroom.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.197
Jiver, check out the
window for the man.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.720
Woo, woo, woo!

12:45.932 --> 12:49.470
- We can't hang in here forever.
- Hey, I want him.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.977
Just be cool, man.

12:53.898 --> 12:54.978
He'll come.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.910
Nirvana, you want a bit?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.455
Is there any left? =yes.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.623
You wait in here,
watch for the man.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.634
All right now, lady.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.758
Quietly. Do it nice.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.156
Are you hungry.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.411
Let's see what rosaria
has for dinner.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.168
Rosaria.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.761
Rosarial

14:09.223 --> 14:10.429
we're home!

14:29.702 --> 14:30.702
Man, you...

14:32.163 --> 14:33.824
- Smack the whore.
- Get her, man!

14:40.129 --> 14:41.960
Let's get the fuck outta here!

14:42.173 --> 14:43.458
Use the back!

14:43.674 --> 14:45.960
Take her, she's seen us,
she can finger us all.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.891
Come on,

15:03.111 --> 15:04.111
keep moving.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.605
Get in there, girl!

15:17.834 --> 15:21.326
There is only one truth about
the use of the death penalty.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.337
To show that killing is wrong.

15:28.553 --> 15:29.838
Thank you, senator.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.919
That was senator Robert mclean.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.883
And this has been newsdesk, brought
to you by kabc Los Angeles.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.512
I'm geri Nichols.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.194
Nirvana, how long
we gonna stay here?

15:49.407 --> 15:51.443
Ah, it's nice here.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.776
Yeah, and we got
a nice little lady.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.281
What are we gonna do.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.616
Waste her?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.040
She's seen us, she
can finger us all.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.494
The man saw me twice, up close.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.875
Aw, man.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.587
We look all the same
to whitey, anyway.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.169
He'll never pick you out, jiver.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.182
I'm gonna fuck you lady.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.102
You're strange.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.449
Paul!

19:30.753 --> 19:31.868
Paul!

19:36.884 --> 19:38.215
Paul, is that you?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.257
Ah! Oh!

20:03.369 --> 20:05.109
Mr. kersey, I'm
inspector mankiewicz.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.160
I know it's a terrible time.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.738
Any news of my daughter?

20:08.958 --> 20:10.558
Not yet, but as soon
as we hear anything,

20:10.626 --> 20:11.957
we'll let you know.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.377
Mr. kersey, the
descriptions you gave

20:15.589 --> 20:17.705
the officers about
your attackers

20:17.925 --> 20:19.335
they're very unclear.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.793
Is there anything you can add?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.383
I came in this front door.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.260
There were two men
standing there,

20:27.476 --> 20:28.841
at least two men back there.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.597
One of them hits me on the head

20:30.813 --> 20:32.428
and I'm knocked unconscious.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.481
Surely you saw one of them
before you were attacked.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.560
Hey, I told your men
everything I know.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.180
We understand that the same
sort of thing happened in

20:47.204 --> 20:49.946
New York City, we ran
it down in our computer.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.199
Yeah, that's right.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.336
Some muggers followed my wife and
daughter home from the market.

20:57.548 --> 21:01.416
The police there got a very good
description of the muggers, too.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.296
But it didn't do any good.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.968
We do what we can.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.589
Oh.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.765
One of my men found
this on the floor.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.853
Honey, if they don't need
us anymore, let's go to my place.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.437
They're going to be all night.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.990
Mr. kersey, we just got some
news about your daughter.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.534
How is she?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.448
Is this your
daughter, Mr. kersey?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.872
Mr. kersey, is that Carol?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.809
Get some sleep, darling.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.392
You go on back to bed.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.900
I want to stay here a while.
I'll be along in a moment.

22:13.082 --> 22:17.951
Unto almighty god, we
commend the soul of our sister, Carol

22:18.170 --> 22:21.128
and we commit
her body to the ground.

22:22.007 --> 22:26.171
Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.054
In sure and certain
hope of a resurrection

22:31.267 --> 22:35.260
unto eternal life through
our lord, Jesus Christ.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.974
Don't worry about
the new building, Paul.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.775
It can wait.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.853
Oh, I'll be back soon.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.772
It's not necessary.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.359
It is for me.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.369
Thanks for the
use of your cabin.

24:12.826 --> 24:13.986
This is the new model, Paul.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.123
The department of building
and safety approved it

24:16.163 --> 24:17.369
while you were away.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.572
Has Elliott chosen
a building type yet.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.227
We've drawn up what the
building might look like

24:21.251 --> 24:22.787
in three different renderings,

24:23.003 --> 24:25.460
so we could compare
how they'd look.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.913
Call him up and make an
appointment and I'll run it over.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.583
His wife'll probably
make the choice,

24:30.803 --> 24:33.135
but we'll let him run
through the motions anyway.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.679
Get me Mr. cass, at
the radio station please.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.927
Our market is local news.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.768
Fires, traffic jams, droughts.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.096
I'm not so sure, Elliott.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.728
We've got our awards for
international reporting.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.935
I don't give a damn about awards.

24:49.154 --> 24:52.942
Kbex's local news has kept us
out of first place too damn long.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.238
You're the boss, Elliot.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.488
If you want, we'll take them
on traffic jam for traffic jam.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.866
Oh! See you later.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.722
Why didn't somebody
tell me you were here?

25:01.834 --> 25:04.792
Got some news for ya, your
building's been approved.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.460
What's it gonna cost me?

25:06.672 --> 25:09.880
Well, we could get it in a steel
frame and reflective glass,

25:10.092 --> 25:12.708
it'll cost you $250 a square foot.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.419
Wooden frame $100 a square foot.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.174
Concrete, $150 a square foot.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.765
All the figures are right here.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.769
I can't believe these prices.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.021
Welcome back.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.102
I see you made a noisy comeback.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.028
Hello, yeah, go ahead.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.027
I heard you were
in the building.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.154
I was just gonna
drop by and see you.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.361
See you tonight.

25:40.581 --> 25:45.951
Oh geri, you know, I don't feel like
I'm fit company for socializing.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.455
Not yet, anyway.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.912
Paul. Are you out there?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.248
- Come on back!
- Okay.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.671
Mr. kersey, 1
was at your office,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.128
they told me you'd be here.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.367
We were hoping you'd come down
and look at some mugshots,

25:59.391 --> 26:00.631
see if you can pick out some of

26:00.684 --> 26:02.284
those people that were
in your apartment.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.680
You know, it happened so fast.

26:06.774 --> 26:08.435
No, I don't think so.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.813
The pictures might
jog your memory.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.145
There really isn't any use.

28:58.570 --> 29:02.313
My heart's desire and
prayer to god for Israel

29:02.532 --> 29:04.648
is that they might be saved.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.453
"If thou shalt confess
with thy mouth the lord

29:10.666 --> 29:13.328
"Jesus and shall
believe in thine heart

29:13.543 --> 29:15.659
"that god hath raised
him from the dead,

29:15.879 --> 29:18.245
"thou shall be saved.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.501
"For with the heart-"

29:24.596 --> 29:26.928
- what are you looking for?
- Looking for a room.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.971
No trouble here, you hear.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.799
$50 a month.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.808
No TV, no music after 11.

29:35.399 --> 29:38.141
And no police, mister?

29:38.402 --> 29:39.562
Kimble.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.268
No police, you hear?

29:41.488 --> 29:42.819
I hear.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.237
Shall I join you?

30:35.334 --> 30:37.074
Oh, it's you.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.159
Who were you expecting?

30:39.963 --> 30:41.499
Raquel Welch?

30:48.889 --> 30:50.254
What brings you here?

30:50.474 --> 30:52.089
I thought I'd come and see you.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.595
It doesn't happen too
often these days.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.847
Half my wardrobe"s here.

30:57.064 --> 31:00.648
I'm getting very bored with
wearing the other half.

31:04.237 --> 31:07.775
Geri, I'm gonna be a while.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.482
Why don't you go on with
what you're gonna do?

31:10.702 --> 31:13.159
I'll see you back at the office.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.065
Thank you for calling
general lock company.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.392
Hello, yes.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.228
I have some locks
here that need changing.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.359
Could you do it for me today, please?

33:17.746 --> 33:20.032
That's them, there they are.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.579
Let's go.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.082
You and you, out.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.500
Not you.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.055
Do you believe in Jesus?

35:52.275 --> 35:53.606
Yes, I do.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.188
Well, you're gonna meet him.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.238
Mr. kersey, do you
wanna join the party?

37:04.097 --> 37:05.177
No, thanks.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.862
Area of San Francisco
killed, three people

37:27.078 --> 37:29.535
and wounded over one thousand.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.410
Hello. You're in.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.828
I've been in all night.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.202
I called.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.832
I haven't been
answering the phone.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.960
Those newspaper people
keep calling ever since...

37:42.177 --> 37:43.963
Well, I just haven't been answering.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.596
Can I cook dinner
for you tomorrow night?

37:47.807 --> 37:49.843
Friday night's better.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.424
Friday night, then.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.259
Okay, night.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.311
Two men were shot dead in

37:55.523 --> 37:58.731
the now vacant Hollywood
hotel on Hollywood boulevard.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.309
Police believe the two
deaths are drug-related.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.441
Names are withheld pending the
notification of the families.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.027
Six, yes, six free
films to go with for your camera.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.194
It's 9 o'clock
here in Los Angeles.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.754
The temperature is 72 degrees.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.961
We'll go over to
Jane Saunders for the traffic.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.367
There's a hold-up on Hollywood
boulevard at western where

38:30.391 --> 38:32.882
a traffic accident has
tailbacks for half a mile.

38:33.102 --> 38:36.344
So drivers, be sure to avoid
Hollywood at western.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.226
That's it, kiddo,
give 'em the local news.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.861
Of course, in my case,
my car's such a mess anyway,

38:44.030 --> 38:46.646
a few more bangs wouldn't
make much difference.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.346
Now, here's geri Nichols with news
of an experiment in Illinois

38:49.410 --> 38:51.867
that's taking young
people away from crime.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.786
In Illinois state prison...

38:58.127 --> 39:01.915
J; Over the hill and everywhere

39:02.131 --> 39:05.339
j go tell it on the mountain

39:05.552 --> 39:09.044
that Jesus Christ is born

39:09.973 --> 39:13.636
j thou would not be a sinner

39:13.852 --> 39:18.186
j; I'll tell you the reason why

39:18.398 --> 39:21.105
j' praise the lord

39:25.154 --> 39:29.318
j hallelujah

40:19.667 --> 40:21.874
No! Stop! Come on.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.951
Stop! Stop!

40:27.216 --> 40:28.626
Stop, please, no!

40:33.556 --> 40:34.841
I will be good.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.093
Mary!

40:36.309 --> 40:38.174
We're just borrowin' your mama,
motherfucker.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.221
Don't hurt Mary.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.919
Keep back!

41:21.396 --> 41:23.853
No, please, please.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.057
Hey, watch out, asshole.

43:34.195 --> 43:35.401
Goodbye.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.957
Hey, over here!

43:59.595 --> 44:01.210
Hold it a minute.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.926
Let me get this straight.

44:04.475 --> 44:08.514
Some guy pops up out of
nowhere, he starts shooting,

44:08.729 --> 44:11.266
and you and your wife don't
know what he looks like.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.848
That guy saved
our lives, damn it.

44:14.068 --> 44:17.105
Where the hell were you guys?
Giving out parking tickets?

44:17.321 --> 44:18.527
Hold him.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.321
All right, lady.

44:21.534 --> 44:22.865
What did he look like?

44:23.077 --> 44:24.863
He was uh, he was...

44:26.372 --> 44:29.239
He was a very good citizen,
that's what he was.

44:29.458 --> 44:31.244
He was a killer.

44:31.460 --> 44:35.248
Now you want to stay here forever,
play it that way.

44:35.464 --> 44:38.456
You're vital witnesses.
Now don't play games with me.

44:38.676 --> 44:41.588
You both saw him.
Now I want a description.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.169
He's 21.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.880
Blonde with a club foot.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.342
Funny, from where I was,
he was a large black man

44:49.562 --> 44:51.223
with a red beard.

44:51.439 --> 44:53.350
Now, you let these guys
get me to the hospital

44:53.566 --> 44:56.353
or I'm gonna give the press
interviews you won't believe.

44:57.361 --> 45:00.228
- Take him.
- Close it off upstairs.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.654
I said close it off.

45:03.993 --> 45:05.733
You know what we've
got here, don't you?

45:05.953 --> 45:07.443
A goddamn vigilante.

45:12.251 --> 45:14.583
My wife goes to mace class,
would you believe that?

45:15.546 --> 45:17.232
The police commissioner's
wife at mace class

45:17.256 --> 45:19.338
learning to spray attackers.

45:20.593 --> 45:23.300
Now you tell me there's
a vigilante out there.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.048
My god.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.425
The lid"s only just
kept down as it is.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.282
I can just see all kinds of panicked
citizens taking to the streets

45:30.311 --> 45:32.267
if this gets out.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.347
They'll knock off anyone with
long hair or tacky clothes.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.686
I think that I can find him.

45:36.901 --> 45:39.254
If we even start an investigation,
the press will hear of it.

45:39.278 --> 45:43.442
I learn half of what goes on in my
own force from the newspapers.

45:43.658 --> 45:44.943
Tell me...

45:46.244 --> 45:50.578
Wasn't there a vigilante in
Boston about five years ago?

45:50.790 --> 45:53.247
- New York.
- New York, right.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.415
Get on to them, see
how they handled it.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.038
It stopped there.

45:57.630 --> 46:00.747
Well, what about this report? You've-
=t know.

46:01.509 --> 46:03.340
The Los Angeles police
has asked for advice

46:03.552 --> 46:05.759
on the vigilante situation.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.592
But there's something else
you should know, sir.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.012
Paul kersey now
lives in Los Angeles.

46:12.228 --> 46:15.220
Are you suggesting that kersey's
out there killing again?

46:15.439 --> 46:17.805
Paul kersey was
an interesting man,

46:18.025 --> 46:20.482
so I kept a loose tab on him.

46:20.695 --> 46:23.107
He worked in
Chicago for a while,

46:23.322 --> 46:26.405
where he met an old friend of his
who ran a radio station in la.

46:26.701 --> 46:30.193
And he transferred his
business out there.

46:30.413 --> 46:33.405
That doesn't mean that he's
the Los Angeles vigilante.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.286
No, sir.

46:36.502 --> 46:39.289
But, Christ, what if he is.

46:39.505 --> 46:41.211
Yes, sir.

46:41.424 --> 46:45.963
If he is, and if he's caught,
the trail leads straight back to us.

46:46.178 --> 46:48.043
We had him and we didn't prosecute.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.129
For damn good reason.

46:50.349 --> 46:52.431
Street crime was down 5090.

46:55.271 --> 46:56.471
Never mind that, commissioner.

46:56.605 --> 46:59.438
We know we'd have a martyr on
our hands if we brought him to trial,

46:59.650 --> 47:02.141
but the fact is, we let him go.

47:04.113 --> 47:07.025
If he's caught now, he'll tell
the world that we let him go.

47:07.241 --> 47:08.401
I'd be disbarred.

47:08.617 --> 47:10.470
It'd be the end of your
career, Mr. commissioner.

47:10.494 --> 47:14.453
And you, inspector, would
not collect your pension.

47:14.707 --> 47:16.368
And I retire this year.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.245
It's quite simple.

47:18.461 --> 47:20.497
We have to get him
before they get him.

47:20.713 --> 47:22.078
We?

47:22.298 --> 47:23.504
You.

47:25.343 --> 47:29.962
Well, I could go to Los Angeles
in answer to their request.

47:30.473 --> 47:34.807
And I'll try to find out if kersey's
up to his old tricks again.

47:35.019 --> 47:37.601
If he is, I'll try to stop him.

47:39.106 --> 47:40.266
Quietly.

47:40.483 --> 47:41.563
Kill him?

48:35.329 --> 48:36.819
Hi, frank, over here.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.533
Mike, good to see you.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.114
Frank, welcome to L.A.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.165
Thank you.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.539
- Gesundheit.
- Thank you.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.211
Is this the file?

48:46.424 --> 48:49.416
Newspaper clippings and police
photographs on Paul kersey.

48:49.635 --> 48:52.718
Most of them, of course, are about how
his daughter and housekeeper

48:52.930 --> 48:55.046
were killed by muggers.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.619
We checked out every person who
suffered a loss through muggings

48:57.643 --> 49:00.385
in the last six months,
particularly in death.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.435
How many people did it give you?

49:03.441 --> 49:04.851
Deaths, 96.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.728
Seriously injured, 1,500.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.275
Rapes, 579.

49:08.487 --> 49:09.693
I can go on.

49:10.573 --> 49:13.531
You tie down a
lot of men that way.

49:13.742 --> 49:15.573
What did you do?

49:15.786 --> 49:18.448
We tried that route.
But we gave up.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.121
I'm going back to the hotel,
I want to lie down.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.948
I think I caught a
cold on the plane.

49:23.169 --> 49:24.625
And the smog
doesn't help anyway.

49:24.837 --> 49:25.872
Hey, babe.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.292
You're not holding
out on me are you?

49:29.508 --> 49:32.045
Hey, one cop to another.

49:32.261 --> 49:33.967
Would I do a thing like that?

49:45.649 --> 49:47.605
It's all right, miss Nichols.

49:52.615 --> 49:55.903
- How did you get in?
- It comes with the job.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.575
You'd be amazed
at the things they teach us.

49:58.787 --> 50:02.371
What's a New York cop
breaking into my apartment?

50:02.583 --> 50:05.495
It's about your
friend, Mr. Paul kersey.

50:05.711 --> 50:06.711
How do you know him?

50:06.879 --> 50:09.040
- It comes...
- With the job.

50:10.716 --> 50:14.880
He killed nine people in
New York City four years ago.

50:17.139 --> 50:19.255
You're not serious.

50:19.475 --> 50:20.806
I'm very serious.

50:22.895 --> 50:24.260
What station are you from?

50:24.480 --> 50:26.641
West 75th street. Ah, ah, ah.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.142
It won't help calling anybody.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.565
They sent you, didn't they.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.483
Well, not exactly.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.862
Was Mr. kersey charged
with killing nine people?

50:36.075 --> 50:37.190
He was not.

50:38.410 --> 50:41.868
See, the people he
killed were muggers.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.530
Even though the public
never knew who he was,

50:44.750 --> 50:46.206
he became a hero.

50:48.796 --> 50:51.708
And there were those that felt
we should encourage him

50:51.924 --> 50:53.880
to stop and leave it at that.

50:54.885 --> 50:58.628
But now, you see,
he's doing it again.

51:00.849 --> 51:03.215
Here, in Los Angeles.

51:04.478 --> 51:07.390
There's no one I can
call to verify all this?

51:07.606 --> 51:09.642
My chief thinks I'm on vacation.

51:09.858 --> 51:13.567
You break in and tell me
vou think Paul's a murderer.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.940
What else are you
entitled to tell me?

51:16.156 --> 51:18.568
We think it would be
better if he stopped.

51:18.784 --> 51:21.742
I asked him once, it
didn't seem to work.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.741
I think maybe he'll
listen to you.

51:24.957 --> 51:27.573
I hardly ever see him
outside of the radio station.

51:27.793 --> 51:30.535
Doesn't it make you wonder
what he may be doing at night?

51:46.895 --> 51:49.432
Hey, mister, got a
half hour to spare?

51:50.774 --> 51:52.810
What's wrong you,
haven't you got one?

51:53.027 --> 51:54.187
Fuck you.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.447
Paul, where have you been?

52:08.667 --> 52:10.532
I was just out. =out where?

52:10.753 --> 52:12.209
I was with a friend.

52:12.421 --> 52:14.582
=a man. What man?

52:14.798 --> 52:16.163
Calm down.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.419
Where do you think I've been?

52:23.349 --> 52:24.839
Killing muggers.

52:31.231 --> 52:32.437
You're crazy.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.567
A New York cop broke
into my place tonight.

52:36.779 --> 52:38.440
Not that...

52:38.656 --> 52:41.193
What the hell's his
name, frank ochoa?

52:41.408 --> 52:43.649
He said he talked to you once.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.619
He told me that.

52:48.874 --> 52:50.660
Yes, that's true.

52:50.876 --> 52:52.332
That you killed muggers?

52:52.544 --> 52:55.126
No, that he asked me not to.

52:55.339 --> 52:57.045
Why would he ask you
not to if you weren't

52:57.257 --> 52:58.963
doing it in the first place?

52:59.551 --> 53:03.135
Listen, when a policeman
finds a killer, what does he do?

53:03.347 --> 53:04.837
They arrest him.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.722
Well, he did seem a bit odd.

53:07.935 --> 53:10.301
Not only odd, the guy is crazy.

53:10.521 --> 53:11.931
It's that simple.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.977
He had a moment in his life when
he was a somebody.

53:16.193 --> 53:19.560
He was in charge of the
vigilante killings in New York.

53:19.780 --> 53:22.988
He was all over the
newspapers, the television,

53:23.200 --> 53:24.861
asked a lot of questions.

53:25.077 --> 53:27.614
The most important question
they asked him was,

53:27.830 --> 53:29.661
"who is the vigilante?â

53:29.915 --> 53:32.497
"Have you found the vigilante?"
Of course, he hadn't.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.792
And me, I was one on a
long list of people

53:35.003 --> 53:37.790
who had family killed
by the muggers.

53:38.006 --> 53:41.123
For all I know, he might have
accused every one of them.

53:41.343 --> 53:45.052
He became such a damn
pest that I left New York.

53:45.264 --> 53:48.301
But I'll be damned if
I leave Los Angeles.

53:48.517 --> 53:50.803
I'm not gonna let him
come between you and me.

53:53.939 --> 53:56.021
I thought things had. What?

53:56.233 --> 53:57.564
Come between us.

53:58.444 --> 53:59.604
Hell, no.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.900
Stay the night?

54:04.116 --> 54:06.448
I thought you'd never ask.

54:24.136 --> 54:25.842
Do I get a key again?

54:26.054 --> 54:27.294
Oh, yeah.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.838
Here, you can have it copied.

54:30.058 --> 54:33.175
Now don't lose it, we may not be
able to get back in tonight.

54:33.395 --> 54:34.885
Oh, I can't see you tonight.

54:35.105 --> 54:37.266
- Why not?
- It's Judy's birthday.

54:37.483 --> 54:40.225
I'm staying over with
her and carmella after the party.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.985
Now who's keeping us apart?

54:49.953 --> 54:51.159
Hello.

54:51.371 --> 54:52.371
Frank, hi.

54:52.498 --> 54:54.363
Mike.

54:55.042 --> 54:56.782
I hate to ask you
this after you've been

54:57.002 --> 55:00.790
so helpful but could you do
something for me tonight?

55:01.006 --> 55:02.046
Yeah, go ahead what is it?

55:02.090 --> 55:03.955
I want you to take
my car and park it

55:04.176 --> 55:07.543
outside the front of
Paul kersey's house.

56:45.652 --> 56:46.858
Police!

56:47.654 --> 56:48.769
Follow the bus.

56:51.241 --> 56:54.028
Proclaimed by god himself
in the holy scripture.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.906
He's the prince of the
kings of the earth.

56:57.748 --> 57:01.332
One of these days he'll
be called king of kings.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.955
Yes, heir of the heirs,
prince of kings

57:04.171 --> 57:06.628
is just the beginning
of his glory.

57:10.093 --> 57:15.429
We must confess in god that
if thou shall confess the

57:15.641 --> 57:17.677
lord Jesus with thy mouth...

57:21.021 --> 57:23.933
You run in there
with your automobile.

57:24.149 --> 57:27.983
You run outta gas and go
to the filling station.

57:32.824 --> 57:36.988
You go in there on Sunday
morning and fill your car up.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.580
Taxi!

57:46.797 --> 57:48.253
Come on, will you?

57:49.132 --> 57:50.497
Follow that bus.

57:53.428 --> 57:55.259
It isn't moving.

57:55.472 --> 57:57.633
When it moves, follow it.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.993
What do we do now? We wait.

59:10.505 --> 59:11.745
Achoo!

59:31.943 --> 59:35.106
- Can I see something there?
- Stop it! Stop it!

59:36.239 --> 59:39.527
Just let me check the color.
One second. Damn!

59:40.410 --> 59:43.698
I really am a nice guy but
vou act like fools around me.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:04.882
Now, that bus there.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.013
I hope you got
the bread for this.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.268
This is police business.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.722
I ain't known
for my community spirit.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.148
Show me some money.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.646
Here, start with this.

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:18.315
Go ahead, will you!

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:34.793
Stop it!

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.755
Come on, leave me alone.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:47.800
Give me a break, you guys.

01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:19.809
What's down there?
=point fermin.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:22.648
What's that?

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.695
One of those
historical monuments.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.469
There's nothing there
this time of night.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.324
You wait here.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.618
You get the other
half when I get back.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.071
Whatever happens, wait here.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.867
If you hear shooting,
don't worry.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.169
It's just target practice.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.865
What's happening, old man?
Where you been hiding out?

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:12.948
Whoo!

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:15.530
All right, this is the shit.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.076
Let's see the stuff.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.036
Show the man. =this is the best.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.212
This stuff is sweet like sugar.

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.876
Watch out!

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.882
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.634
Over there, man!

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.009
What the fuck's this?

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:24.103
Fuck it, man.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.157
I'll be damned! You?

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.657
You stuck your neck out for me?

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:08.587
It was you or them.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:12.583
- Did you get them all?
- One of them got away.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:16.753
Get the motherfucker for me.

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:22.968
Our father who art in
heaven hallowed be thy name.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:46.953
He's dead.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.582
Poor bastard.
I knew he was holding out on me.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.753
Lieutenant, over here.

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:55.208
Listen, I'm at point fermin in San Pedro.
We need more photographers down here.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.134
Who blew away the cop?

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.808
I'm bleeding, man. Who did it?

01:07:07.315 --> 01:07:08.646
No sign of the cab
that called in.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.099
Cab service said he
was just passing by,

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.434
he didn't see anything.

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:14.394
They just want to
stay out of trouble.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:20.157
Listen, you're
gonna die right here

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.577
if I don't hear who
killed that cop.

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.201
Nirvana. He got away.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.704
Who's that? =nirvana! Nirvana.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.202
Charles Wilson.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.121
Oh, fuck!

01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:35.252
Put out a tracer
on nirvana, also

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.335
known as Charles Wilson,
for murder.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.049
No hurry.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.896
How can an entrance
door cost 500,000 dollars?

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.600
Your wife is a very
expensive designer.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.732
She wants Italian
marble, Mexican mosaic,

01:07:56.948 --> 01:08:00.611
sculpted angels blowing horns
on either side of the doorway.

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:02.363
It costs a lot of money.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.911
But here we've drawn
it up in concrete.

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:09.662
Even has the angels on
either side of the door.

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.333
It costs a hell of a lot less.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.082
Why don't you ask
vour wife about it?

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:16.210
- She'll hate it.
- Ask her anyhow.

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.254
Let me know one way or
the other, will you?

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.180
Do you know what time
they're gonna make their move?

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.466
Ah-=-ha.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.207
Well thanks, sergeant. Will you
please keep those calls coming in?

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.265
All right.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:32.813
Hi Fred. What's happening?

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:35.826
There was a big shoot-out last
night at point fermin down at San Pedro.

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:38.319
Five people killed
including a New York cop.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:41.773
Our manner department said that
the tac. Squad's been called in.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:45.156
I want you glued to
those police monitors. Glued.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.703
A man called Wilson got away
from the shoot-out last night.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:51.533
The word is they may move
to take him this afternoon.

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:55.211
If they do, I want someone there.
We could use a good exclusive.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.751
Say Fred, where do you get
these monitors?

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.671
We adapt them ourselves.
Lots of people do.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:03.676
Happen to have a
spare one lying around?

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.096
There was one we
were gonna get rid of.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.095
Uh...

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.932
Here, we've got better ones now but
this one still works pretty well.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.731
A gift from kabc radio.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:19.398
The tac. Squad,
they operate on this band

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.696
and they identify with 3a-90.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:25.446
The truth is, their programs
are a lot more interesting than ours.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:26.868
Thanks, Fred.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.749
Yankee Charlie
available and will handle.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:47.423
3a-68, subject's residence
located as 914 philmore.

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.803
Units moving into position.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.599
5h-13, this is 3a-90.

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.852
We could use a definite 10-20.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.525
Affirmative, 914 philmore.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:00.772
Stay clear.

01:10:00.988 --> 01:10:03.650
No units to move
until I give the word.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.482
Squad three moving
into position, over.

01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:11.279
5h-13, this is 3a-90.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.990
We have eyeballed
your 10-30, over.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.575
Has he spotted you?

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:16.795
Negative.

01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:18.564
We're across the
streert from the 10-20.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:19.837
Can take him now.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.334
Hold it, he's mine.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:22.757
Standing by.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:25.836
3a-90, this is 5c-61.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:29.843
Sir, they just entered
10-20 with two exits.

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:36.221
3a-46, subject lighting object.

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:37.726
Appears to be narcotics.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.352
Permission to move in.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:40.684
Negative.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:41.688
I don't want those
women involved.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.986
Wait till he comes out.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:53.450
George, you got a cigarette?

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.873
Section 804, await instructions.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.853
This is 3a-90. Someone just
jumped onto the roof of 914.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.937
Confirm it was one of us, over.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.523
How the hell do
I know who it is?

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.199
Hold your positions.

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:57.181
Don't give me that
shit, you fucking bitch.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.432
Fuck off, you asshole.
I'm getting out.

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.230
Give me that stuff, you cunt!

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:28.040
Watch over, he's got a knife.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.120
Cool it, the streets
are too crowded.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.426
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:44.186
Okay, fellas, let's get him.
Hold him down.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.249
==

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.955
How was the birthday party?

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.917
We're getting a bit
old for birthdays.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:55.754
- Have you seen this?
- Oh, yeah. I saw it.

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:57.885
Do you know anything about it?

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.303
No more than you do.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:03.602
I understand your station,
kabc, got an exclusive this

01:14:03.814 --> 01:14:05.896
afternoon when they caught
the guy who killed him.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.769
I heard it in the car.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:09.020
Have you eaten?

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:11.116
No, I drove straight
here when I heard the news.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.362
Let's go to a
nice place tonight.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.485
Okay, but I'd like to
freshen up first.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.301
How long will it take you,
about an hour?

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:18.370
About that.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.991
I'll pick you up in an hour.

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.534
You know, I rather liked him.

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:25.742
He was nutty, just like I told you.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.722
At least they caught
the man that killed him.

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:28.957
See you later.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:41.137
Prosecution has presented
only circumstantial evidence

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.308
that Charles Wilson was
the person that shot

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:47.605
and killed detective frank
ochoa on the night of may 14th.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:50.228
It is proven that the
defendant attacked

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:54.687
several police officers on may
15th but psychiatric testimony

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:58.149
indicates that he was
under the influence of pcp,

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.200
a mind-altering drug.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:04.621
Charles I. Wilson
was remanded to

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.165
the mclarren state hospital

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:09.790
until such time as the
medical examining board

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:13.544
finds him fit to resume
his place in society.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:19.303
I suppose this is the Dr. Clark
that's gonna turn him into a little angel.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.720
Would a normal
prison do any better?

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.518
It would keep him from killing
somebody else for a while.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.604
Is this all the stuff that's
going into your article?

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:32.145
When's it come out?

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.647
I've got a couple more
sessions at the hospital.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.526
It's due to go in
the July issue.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:40.324
Do you really believe all this?

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.160
Yes, I do.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:45.909
You might, too,
if you heard Clark.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.162
You think he
could swing me over.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.744
If you met him, you
might learn something.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.373
Maybe you're right.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:57.083
Maybe you're right.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.185
I'm so sorry to
have kept you waiting.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.487
Dr. Clark, this is Mr. kersey.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:20.405
I'm so glad you
wanted to come along.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:23.610
The more people that understand
our work, the better.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.569
I appreciate your
letting me come.

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:27.200
Say, doctor.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.202
Where is the men's room?

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:31.033
Let me show you.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:34.211
You go straight down the
hall, around the corner,

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.209
and second on your left.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:37.585
Thank you.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:39.921
The right.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:53.556
Would Dr. Ferguson report to
the intensive care unit?

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.483
Dr. al Ferguson
to intensive care.

01:17:53.294 --> 01:17:54.579
You're late.

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:57.502
Look, they gave me the cover.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:59.125
How about that?

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.672
"Next month, geri
Nichols on crime

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:02.841
and punishment in Los Angeles."

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.338
That's terrific.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.095
Do you think Elliott
will give me a raise?

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:09.428
He might give you a reduction
because of all the hours

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.551
you've spent at the hospital.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.307
Well you've spent enough time there.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.363
You must know the
place nearly as well as I do.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.140
Yeah, but I'm
still not converted.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.818
All those theories are
just that, theories.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:24.522
Dom perignon?

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.525
Enjoy your lunch.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:29.781
Can't be my birthday
that was last month.

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:30.997
And you forgot.

01:18:31.165 --> 01:18:32.780
But that's all right.

01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:38.960
Will you marry me?

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:45.672
Are you serious?

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.799
Yes, I'm serious. Jy

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:50.177
you're not sick?

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:53.259
Might be after I see the check,
but I feel fine now.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:56.767
Easy, easy.
This stuff costs $3 a drop.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.643
That was a $9 kiss.

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:01.187
I accept. That'll teach you.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:05.942
This is the way it will go.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.969
Next Wednesday, we'll
catch the midnight flight

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.575
to acapulco and get
married in Mexico.

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:12.528
And I thought you
weren't a romantic.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:16.787
After the program you drive
to my place, then off we go.

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:18.663
Let's get smashed.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:21.495
Then I want it in writing.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.456
I know it's ridiculous.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.916
Excuse me?

01:20:49.136 --> 01:20:51.343
I'm looking for a
patient, Charles Wilson.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:55.635
I believe he's in c block.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:57.432
Is that right?

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:01.687
Yeah, c block,
section 6, room 30.

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:04.436
- It's that way.
- Thank you.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:29.044
I'm Dr. Carter, court-appointed
therapist for Charles Wilson.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.547
They don't have
vour name down here.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.629
My appointment"s for 9 o'clock.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:38.932
They usually give me a list
with doctors coming through.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.510
I was told a Mr. Kay
would be on duty.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.721
That's me, but I can't
let you through unless...

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:46.523
Well, Mr. Kay, I'm already late.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.477
I'd like to finish up and
get home to dinner.

01:21:49.696 --> 01:21:53.564
Now if you don't mind, would
vou please show me to room 30?

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.872
Hi, Eileen. Cook it all by
yourself, did you?

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:03.244
That's right.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.729
If you don't want
to stay for dinner,

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.540
just punch 3600 to get out.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:09.212
36007?

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.211
I've got to take
the doctor down here.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.258
Enjoy the food, then.

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:23.348
Will Dr. dick middlemass
please go to ward 16?

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:26.101
Dr. middlemass to ward 16.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.090
Do you want to use
the interview room here

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:37.407
or see him in the cell?

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.530
This will do.
What's that back there?

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.407
That's the electro-shock room.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:44.532
Since you fellas took over,
they don't use it much.

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.958
It's all done with kindness now.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.627
Isn't that right, doctor?

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:50.045
Therapy.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.122
Call it what you like.

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.550
Okay, Wilson. You got a visitor.

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:01.302
Let's go. You know the routine.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.270
Do you want me to stay?

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.356
It's not necessary.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:19.862
If you need me, just pull this.

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:21.614
I'll get my dinner.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.112
I said to my wife where do
vou want to go for your anniversary?

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:37.739
She said, "I want to go somewhere
I've never been before."

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:39.628
I said, "try the kitchen."

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:19.694
He raped and killed my daughter.

01:25:19.906 --> 01:25:21.567
I read about it.

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:28.992
I'll give you three minutes
'til I ring the alarm.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.997
You're wasting time.

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:46.630
To open the door you punch out-

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.841
- 3600?
- That's right.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.423
Hey man, what's wrong with you?
You got a problem or somethin'?

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:27.470
What's your
fucking problem, man?

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.765
Hey, man, watch
this car, will you.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.746
Paul.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:25.354
That ends our presentation of
"music on the sweet sideâ for now.

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:27.690
But I'll be back at midnight
with some relaxing,

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.776
restful sounds for your
late-night listening.

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:35.197
Kabc news time at 10:30.

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:37.950
The murder of Charles
Wilson at mclarren hospital

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:40.536
has just been revealed
by authorities.

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:43.668
The murder took place tonight of
the man accused of murdering

01:27:43.884 --> 01:27:45.840
New York policeman, frank ochoa.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:49.886
Charles Wilson was undergoing
psychiatric treatment at the hospital.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.305
It is not clear at this time
whether the killing was

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.429
by other prisoners but there
seems to be evidence that

01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:59.888
a man entered Wilson's
cell disguised as a doctor.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.815
Gang warfare downtown
Los Angeles tonight

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:05.519
turned into looting and
violence against the police...

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:56.782
Kabc radio news for
Tuesday, October the 10th.

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.873
At a press conference this
morning inspector mankiewicz

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.167
denied that two murders
in downtown Los Angeles

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:04.335
were the work of a vigilante.

01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:06.960
But rumors still persist that the
spate of street killings,

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:11.714
by a person unknown, may be
by a citizen turned vigilante.

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:15.930
- My wife wants it, we'll have it.
- You got it.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:18.474
You don't put up a
building every day nowadays.

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:22.850
Hey, Paul, we've been
pals for a long time.

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.101
Yup.

01:29:24.317 --> 01:29:27.024
I know geri's going
must have hit you.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:31.105
- Have you been drinking?
- Hey, you know better than that.

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:35.154
Where in the hell have you been at night?
I've called you dozens of times.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.533
Well, I don't often
answer the phone.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:42.707
It rings, sometimes I
answer, sometimes I don't,

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.034
but I'm fine.

01:29:44.254 --> 01:29:46.836
Betty's giving a "new
building" party next Thursday.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:48.497
We'd like you to join us.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:50.582
I'll be there.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.212
Are you sure you're free?

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.340
What else would I be doing?
