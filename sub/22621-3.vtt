WEBVTT

00:14.428 --> 00:16.085
It's so lovely
to finally meet you.

00:16.326 --> 00:19.433
Yeah. Great. Likewise.
God, doesn't the...

00:20.330 --> 00:22.332
smell of school make you want
to kill yourself?

00:24.886 --> 00:27.441
- Um, where's Marion tonight?
- Uh, your guess is as good

00:27.475 --> 00:29.591
as mine. Apparently, my mother
no longer has any interest

00:29.615 --> 00:31.514
in maintaining the welfare
of my children.

00:32.342 --> 00:36.243
And look, I can'’t be here long,
I'’ve got a massive thing to prep

00:36.277 --> 00:37.772
for work so if you could
just sort of stick

00:37.796 --> 00:39.073
to the headlines, just, uh,

00:40.212 --> 00:42.870
just the lowdown, a sneak peak
I suppose. Basically,

00:42.904 --> 00:45.355
what would the trailer be
for this parent's evening?

00:47.599 --> 00:49.566
I'’m not sure,
if you don'’t mind me saying,

00:49.601 --> 00:51.844
I don'’t really understand
your parenting style.

00:52.259 --> 00:54.202
Because you'’re never here,
and when you are, you'’re late.

00:54.226 --> 00:56.239
You barely get involved with any
of the school activities.

00:56.263 --> 00:57.930
- So I just...
- Okay. Okay. I think I know

00:57.954 --> 01:00.198
what this is about. Is this
because I forgot to buy you

01:00.232 --> 01:01.416
a bottle of wine at Christmas?

01:01.440 --> 01:03.339
- No, it's because I...
- Because if it is I...

01:03.373 --> 01:04.661
I really don'’t think that's
very fair because

01:04.685 --> 01:05.548
I didn't know about the whole

01:05.582 --> 01:07.136
present giving
culture at this school.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.423
- It'’s not...
- What do you want me to do?

01:08.447 --> 01:10.449
Do you want me to bring you
an apple every day?

01:10.967 --> 01:13.521
Do you want me to tip you
at Christmas like the bin men?

01:13.556 --> 01:14.695
- Pardon?
- Oh God,

01:14.729 --> 01:16.110
it'’s like a bloody racket here!

01:16.559 --> 01:17.594
What is this?

01:18.181 --> 01:19.355
Could you all back off a bit?

01:19.941 --> 01:21.181
It's not the antiques roadshow.

01:23.186 --> 01:24.186
Jesus!

01:32.437 --> 01:35.302
Anne's doing the drinks?
Oh, for God's sake.

01:35.612 --> 01:38.443
- Anne's measures are too small.
- It's not Glastonbury, Liz.

01:38.477 --> 01:40.859
Exactly,
it's a bloody school fundraiser.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.620
We need alcohol, Kevin.
Proper measures.

01:43.655 --> 01:46.095
You were the one who said Anne
should do the drinks last time.

01:46.209 --> 01:48.625
I was going by her being Irish.
It was before I knew her.

01:48.970 --> 01:53.596
Am I going insane?
That looks like Caroline Lacy.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.531
Caroline, yeah. Ruben's Mum.
They must be back from Thailand.

01:57.876 --> 02:00.465
Thailand? For a family holiday?
Dear, oh, dear.

02:01.017 --> 02:03.951
Caroline Lacy goes
to our school? Hi, babe.

02:04.503 --> 02:06.505
- Do you know her?
- Do I know her?

02:06.540 --> 02:08.956
- How do you not know her?
- I do know her. We're talking

02:08.990 --> 02:10.751
about her because we know her
and you don't.

02:10.785 --> 02:13.581
Eh, excuse me Liz. I know her.
We started

02:13.616 --> 02:15.825
in the same company together.
We were quite close

02:15.859 --> 02:18.483
at one point. Until she won
every bloody award going.

02:18.517 --> 02:19.898
Follow me kids. Caroline!

02:20.795 --> 02:24.454
- Hello! Hi!
- Hello, you!

02:24.489 --> 02:25.969
I didn't know you went
to this school.

02:26.007 --> 02:28.734
Yeah! Yeah, I do.
These are mine.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.219
What? I thought
they were Marion's.

02:30.874 --> 02:33.291
- No, no, that'’s my mother.
- Oh!

02:33.808 --> 02:35.396
- I love Marion.
- Who doesn't?

02:35.431 --> 02:37.467
Oh, here we go!

02:38.019 --> 02:40.332
- See you around!
- Yeah, see you around.

02:42.472 --> 02:44.854
- She remembered me.
- Didn't say your name.

02:44.888 --> 02:45.888
What?

02:46.821 --> 02:48.341
- Didn't she? I'm sure she did.
- Nope.

02:48.823 --> 02:50.549
Unless your name is 'Around'.

03:02.941 --> 03:05.633
- Is this You've Been Framed?
- No, no, that was my wedding.

03:05.909 --> 03:06.909
That's my Dad.

03:08.774 --> 03:09.810
Oh, God.

03:11.052 --> 03:13.607
That cake looks nice. I might go
and get some cake.

03:13.814 --> 03:15.274
Unless you want to share that
with me?

03:15.298 --> 03:16.920
No, I want to eat all of it
on my own.

03:16.955 --> 03:17.955
Pig.

03:19.647 --> 03:21.615
I think that's the meeting
for the fundraiser.

03:22.271 --> 03:24.480
- Shouldn't we be over there?
- I'm doing drinks.

03:24.514 --> 03:26.585
You're doing the cloakroom.
Why do we need to go

03:26.620 --> 03:29.450
to a meeting?
And don't complicate it, Kevin.

03:29.485 --> 03:31.072
They hate it
when you complicate things.

03:31.107 --> 03:32.936
Why would you want
to get involved?

03:32.971 --> 03:35.531
- Well, you have to do your bit.
- Do you, though? Do you really?

03:35.836 --> 03:37.217
- Yeah, you do.
- Do you, though?

03:37.941 --> 03:40.047
- Yes.
- I'm just gonna go over and...

03:41.393 --> 03:42.393
I'll just go over.

03:45.777 --> 03:46.777
Do you, though?

03:47.848 --> 03:50.575
- Fundraiser!
- Kevin!

03:50.920 --> 03:53.440
- I'’m so sorry!
- You'’ve frightened Anne.

03:53.854 --> 03:55.211
- I'm all right.
- I'm so sorry, Anne.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.754
- I'm all right. I'’m fine now.
- I'’m just saying, you know...

03:58.617 --> 03:59.617
here we go!

04:00.550 --> 04:01.550
Let's do it!

04:02.966 --> 04:05.555
Let's do it for all the kids
who need this kind

04:05.590 --> 04:07.764
of specialized equipment
in the Music Room!

04:07.799 --> 04:09.119
You're doing the cloakroom,
right?

04:09.594 --> 04:11.389
- Yes.
- Great. See you tomorrow.

04:11.768 --> 04:13.391
Yes, yes. See you tomorrow.

04:15.531 --> 04:18.292
- Oh, dear. What happened?
- I don't...

04:19.466 --> 04:20.466
really know.

04:26.507 --> 04:27.508
What'’s going on there?

04:27.750 --> 04:28.934
Charlie and Manus
are best friends

04:28.958 --> 04:30.304
since Manus got a drone.

04:30.925 --> 04:32.686
So me and Cersei Lannister
are being civil

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
for the children.

04:34.032 --> 04:35.032
Manus!

04:41.695 --> 04:42.695
That'’s weird.

04:43.731 --> 04:45.251
- What?
- Oh, it's just whenever, um...

04:47.632 --> 04:48.909
No, forget it,

04:49.703 --> 04:51.503
- I'm being paranoid.
- No, go on, what is it?

04:51.843 --> 04:53.707
- Tell me. Maybe I can...
- Well...

04:53.741 --> 04:54.741
Caroline!

04:56.399 --> 04:59.437
- Hello again!
- Hi. Not working today?

04:59.920 --> 05:02.129
Not today. Spoken Orchid
are pretty good with flexitime.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.511
I don't work Fridays
and I do half days Wednesdays.

05:04.545 --> 05:06.409
Essentially means
I've got a three-day week.

05:06.444 --> 05:09.585
Oh, God. That's sick.
That's brilliant.

05:09.619 --> 05:11.759
Yeah. Stops me running around
like a mental patient.

05:12.001 --> 05:13.796
God, yeah, I imagine it does.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.049
Have you heard
about this Fundraiser?

05:15.073 --> 05:18.525
- Oh God. No way...
- I'm organizing it.

05:18.559 --> 05:22.736
Would I miss that
because I think we have to do

05:22.770 --> 05:26.084
our bit, as parents.
We have to do our bit.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.913
- Got to.
- Anything I can do,

05:27.948 --> 05:29.719
- just say the word.
- We're having a planning meeting

05:29.743 --> 05:32.103
- if you'd like to come to that.
- You bet I would. Anytime.

05:32.642 --> 05:33.642
Over there?

05:34.092 --> 05:35.507
Oh, it's happening now!

05:35.542 --> 05:37.889
Uh, okay. Yeah,
I'’ll just get my bits and bobs.

05:42.169 --> 05:43.446
Still hasn't said your name.

05:48.209 --> 05:49.866
Should, should Kevin come?

05:50.660 --> 05:51.660
Uh...

05:56.252 --> 05:58.875
I like to take this opportunity
to be a little bit creative,

05:58.910 --> 06:02.189
you know, think a little bit
outside the box as it were.

06:02.603 --> 06:05.399
Um, last year
I was 'nibbles king'.

06:05.813 --> 06:08.920
Do you remember?
I had all the bags of crisps

06:08.954 --> 06:10.128
and nuts pinned to me?

06:11.094 --> 06:12.441
That was fun, wasn't it?

06:13.683 --> 06:16.376
Uh, but I thought this year
I'd go one better.

06:17.066 --> 06:18.654
Human cloakroom.

06:20.725 --> 06:22.174
So everyone puts their coats
on me,

06:22.209 --> 06:24.798
instead of hanging them up
in the cloakroom,

06:24.832 --> 06:27.076
I wear everyone's coats!

06:28.008 --> 06:30.838
What a sight! And then...
And then when everyone'’s ready

06:30.873 --> 06:33.703
to go, the cloakroom
comes to them.

06:34.048 --> 06:38.259
Uh, Let's... let's say we charge,
a pound a coat.

06:38.294 --> 06:40.583
Well, why don't we just charge
a pound a coat in the cloakroom?

06:40.607 --> 06:41.607
"Why?"

06:43.195 --> 06:46.578
My God, Amanda,
why are there rainbows?

06:47.061 --> 06:49.926
Why is there Ant and Dec?
Because it'’s fun!

06:49.961 --> 06:52.619
It's fun! Goodness!

06:52.964 --> 06:56.243
Well. I'm going to do it anyway.
So set up a normal cloakroom

06:56.277 --> 06:58.728
if you want, but it's gonna
have stiff competition

06:58.763 --> 06:59.902
from the human cloakroom.

07:00.972 --> 07:03.664
Let... let the battle
of the cloakrooms commence!

07:06.046 --> 07:08.566
Caroline, I just noticed
there's no tombola?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.509
- And I usually do the tombola.
- Well, I just thought

07:10.533 --> 07:13.087
it didn't feel like a tombola
sets the right tone?

07:13.122 --> 07:15.055
- If that makes sense?
- Sure. Of course.

07:15.642 --> 07:17.575
I mean, sorry, Amanda,
I'm not blocking you.

07:18.610 --> 07:21.579
I just think we should be a bit
more ambitious for this one?

07:21.613 --> 07:24.685
This fundraiser is close
to my heart as you know.

07:25.065 --> 07:26.480
With Reuben
and what the music room

07:26.515 --> 07:27.515
means to him.

07:29.552 --> 07:32.693
- Reuben'’s Mithraxic.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:32.728 --> 07:34.248
Oh, no, it means
he's musically gifted!

07:34.350 --> 07:36.490
- Oh, how lovely!
- Well, I'’m more than happy

07:36.525 --> 07:38.295
to melt into the background,
Caroline. I don'’t know,

07:38.319 --> 07:39.319
maybe this year I could

07:39.976 --> 07:41.771
just host it.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.982
Is Liz really doing the drinks?
Because her measures

07:46.017 --> 07:48.502
are demented. I mean,
do you remember the last time

07:48.537 --> 07:50.780
- she did them?
- No. I don't think anyone does.

07:50.815 --> 07:53.611
Ladies! Ladies!
Is everyone listening? Everyone?

07:54.232 --> 07:57.925
We're talking about prizes now.
I really want to make sure

07:57.960 --> 08:00.583
we don't do the same old
cake sale crap this year.

08:01.826 --> 08:03.217
Can't we just do something
a bit fresher?

08:03.241 --> 08:05.726
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Why don't we make it

08:05.761 --> 08:08.280
so that everyone gets a chance
to host?

08:08.729 --> 08:10.938
That would be fun wouldn'’t it?
We could all...

08:10.973 --> 08:13.493
We're doing prizes now, Kevin.
Anyone have any ideas,

08:13.700 --> 08:14.700
about prizes?

08:19.326 --> 08:23.572
Just off the top of my head,
we could do a, uh,

08:24.331 --> 08:26.989
Auction of Promises. You know,
like you get a gardener

08:27.023 --> 08:29.923
to promise to trim your hedge
or something.

08:30.337 --> 08:32.373
- Okay.
- They do it a lot

08:32.408 --> 08:33.408
at Hollywood events.

08:34.168 --> 08:37.171
- Yeah, I love that.
- Like Richard Gere

08:37.689 --> 08:40.174
promises a go on his yacht,
Ricky Martin does a...

08:41.141 --> 08:44.075
something. Uma Thurman
auctioned a kiss at Cannes

08:44.109 --> 08:46.353
and she made 200,000 dollars
or something mad.

08:47.975 --> 08:50.288
- I love it. We're doing that.
- I agree.

08:51.185 --> 08:53.049
- Let's do it.
- I agree.

08:53.705 --> 08:54.705
Agreed.

08:57.088 --> 08:58.607
There she is!

08:59.021 --> 09:00.574
My savior!

09:01.920 --> 09:04.164
Auction of promises. Brilliant.

09:04.198 --> 09:06.925
Oh, please. It's great
to be able to contribute to...

09:08.202 --> 09:10.998
- this cause.
- Listen, between ourselves,

09:11.033 --> 09:13.011
Spoken Orchid are looking
for people at the moment.

09:13.035 --> 09:14.915
Just in case you want
to pass along your resumé.

09:15.451 --> 09:17.764
Really? Oh great, I...
I didn't even know

09:17.798 --> 09:19.078
that you were looking
for people.

09:19.628 --> 09:21.630
- You're coming tonight, right?
- Am I?

09:22.285 --> 09:23.285
I mean, I can.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.841
I mean, I definitely am.

09:26.393 --> 09:29.707
I love to do events
at the school.

09:30.639 --> 09:32.433
Love being at school.
Out of hours.

09:32.468 --> 09:34.204
Oh, and what do you think
of this? We thought

09:34.228 --> 09:36.196
it would be fun to do
a thermometer that showed

09:36.230 --> 09:37.390
how much money was coming in.

09:38.163 --> 09:40.407
- Such fun.
- Would you mind knocking one up?

09:42.305 --> 09:43.755
Love to. No problem.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.688
I'’ve got plenty of time
for crafts.

09:45.723 --> 09:46.976
You need to be able to see it
from the back of the hall.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:48.415 --> 09:49.415
Bye.

09:51.245 --> 09:54.248
Still didn't say your name.
Perfect chance there and all.

09:54.455 --> 09:56.872
Liz! She as good as offered me
a job.

09:56.906 --> 09:59.771
She just wants to see your CV
so she can find out your name.

10:01.255 --> 10:02.255
Hey, hey!

10:03.085 --> 10:05.156
- On the roof.
- Oh. I'm an idiot.

10:05.190 --> 10:08.228
I won't argue with that. Joking.
Happens to the best of us.

10:16.201 --> 10:17.755
- Did you see that?
- Huh?

10:24.002 --> 10:26.108
Caroline Lacy. Yeah,
she's with Spoken Orchid.

10:27.454 --> 10:30.250
Spoken Orchid. I mean
this could be so useful for us,

10:30.284 --> 10:32.079
Paul. Me, especially.
I mean,

10:32.770 --> 10:36.014
the flexitime alone
could change my life.

10:36.049 --> 10:37.889
I mean, if you could
just have them for like an hour

10:37.913 --> 10:39.511
or so that would be great,
what do you think?

10:39.535 --> 10:42.020
Julia, I can't. I think
this thing is going to go on

10:42.055 --> 10:45.403
- for another couple of hours!
- Sorry, what is it again?

10:45.437 --> 10:48.371
Oh, just some team building
bollocks. It never ends.

10:49.269 --> 10:51.927
Baby, I better go. Good luck
with the babysitter!

10:52.203 --> 10:55.171
Whatever you want to do,
I'm right behind you!

11:04.422 --> 11:06.217
- Will you be long?
- Not long at all, no.

11:06.251 --> 11:08.737
It'll be like I've barely left.
Help yourself to beers.

11:08.771 --> 11:09.876
The kids are asleep, so...

11:10.980 --> 11:13.949
- I'm not much of a night owl.
- Oh, dear! Um,

11:13.983 --> 11:16.330
well, what'll keep you awake?
Um.

11:16.917 --> 11:19.540
Sherry? I mean, literally
help yourself to anything.

11:19.575 --> 11:22.785
- I can't be up late.
- Oh, and you won't be, Barbara.

11:22.820 --> 11:26.099
But if you'’re feeling tired,
feel free to have a lie down.

11:26.582 --> 11:27.859
Oh, don't look so worried!

11:28.964 --> 11:31.173
My mother is dead old
and she did this for years.

11:33.037 --> 11:34.279
Uh, do you like MasterChef?

11:35.039 --> 11:36.834
Let'’s get a bit
of MasterChef on.

11:39.043 --> 11:40.838
There you go, Egg Wallace.
Have fun!

11:47.327 --> 11:48.500
It would be fantastic.

11:53.229 --> 11:55.207
Actually if you could help me
pop that on, that'’d be...

11:55.231 --> 11:56.231
brilliant.

11:59.822 --> 12:01.306
Tickets, tickets.

12:02.618 --> 12:03.826
I'll remember, it's fine.

12:03.861 --> 12:05.310
- Okay, okay.
- I'll remember.

12:05.345 --> 12:07.140
- Thank you.
- Thank you. It'’s fun isn't it?

12:23.466 --> 12:25.330
You all right?
You look very uncomfortable.

12:25.365 --> 12:26.815
Oh, no, I'm having a great time.

12:27.470 --> 12:29.265
It's fun, isn't it?
Isn't it fun?

12:29.990 --> 12:31.550
Everyone's responding
really well to it.

12:31.958 --> 12:34.167
You look like you're melting.
Do you want some water?

12:34.201 --> 12:35.824
Oh, yeah. Sure, that'’d be...

12:38.447 --> 12:39.897
Can'’t... can't bend my arm.

12:40.932 --> 12:43.141
Oh! That's someone's...

12:43.176 --> 12:44.256
Someone'’s phone's ringing.

12:45.523 --> 12:47.483
- Don't touch anything Anne.
- I was just looking.

12:49.630 --> 12:52.012
Oh, hey, go easy there, now.
Your measures are very large.

12:52.288 --> 12:55.602
They're not, they're normal.
Normal for a school fundraiser.

12:55.636 --> 12:57.811
Yeah, well, just don't get high
off your own supply

12:57.846 --> 12:59.192
and start acting the giddy goat.

12:59.226 --> 13:01.884
- Oh, shush.
- Last time you did the drinks

13:01.919 --> 13:04.611
I woke up in the park.
My husband was furious.

13:06.475 --> 13:08.960
- What is that anyway?
- I dunno, Sangria.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.962
- What is sangria? Red wine...?
- Anything.

13:11.652 --> 13:14.172
Sangria is red wine
and anything. In Spanish,

13:14.207 --> 13:15.933
sangria means "any old shit".

13:18.521 --> 13:20.361
Can I have some alcohol please.
I don't care what.

13:20.385 --> 13:21.524
I've got just the thing.

13:21.559 --> 13:23.157
They've got me
manning the thermometer now.

13:23.181 --> 13:25.080
I made it and now I'm working it
all night.

13:25.114 --> 13:26.875
It's like building
your own gallows.

13:26.909 --> 13:28.393
I won'’t be able
to get straight home.

13:28.428 --> 13:30.085
I've got this sleepy-looking
old woman

13:30.119 --> 13:31.189
looking after the kids.

13:33.364 --> 13:36.574
God, I wish
he hadn't put my coat on first.

13:47.309 --> 13:49.690
Uh oh, the drinks are out
already. I'd better get

13:49.725 --> 13:51.347
a move on
before you're all legless.

13:54.109 --> 13:57.526
Okay. Now,
can I get a "Hey, girl"?

13:59.735 --> 14:02.289
"Hey girl!" No? Okay.

14:03.394 --> 14:07.881
Okay. Welcome everybody!
Are we gonna have fun?

14:08.468 --> 14:10.297
Okay. Well, the answer
to that question is,

14:10.332 --> 14:11.643
you bet we are. Now,

14:12.437 --> 14:15.337
we're gonna do things
a little bit differently

14:15.371 --> 14:20.342
this year, we're doing
an 'auction of promises'.

14:21.515 --> 14:24.104
Ooh!

14:24.449 --> 14:27.142
Yeah, just pop your promise
on a piece of paper,

14:27.176 --> 14:29.247
anything you like,
and stick it in the box.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.905
As you know,
it's for a good cause.

14:31.940 --> 14:33.596
We've been trying to get
a Yamaha keyboard

14:33.631 --> 14:35.529
for the music room
for a few years.

14:36.979 --> 14:38.015
Now...

14:39.085 --> 14:42.019
I can see there's
only two promises in here so far

14:42.053 --> 14:45.470
so come on, everybody,
let's get those promises in!

14:46.230 --> 14:48.025
Okay, thank you.

14:48.542 --> 14:51.028
Have you noticed how Amanda
hoses herself down every time

14:51.062 --> 14:52.342
she interacts with me
or my kids?

14:52.995 --> 14:54.755
- Does she?
- Hmm. Thought I was imagining it

14:55.101 --> 14:56.101
at first, but yeah.

14:56.965 --> 14:58.632
What are you eating,
are those onion rings?

14:58.656 --> 15:00.736
- Where did you find those?
- Found them in the back.

15:02.246 --> 15:05.939
- Oh, from 2002.
- They're 15 years old?

15:05.974 --> 15:08.148
It's fine. They're 90 percent
E numbers.

15:08.183 --> 15:10.495
- These crisps will outlive us.
- Go on then.

15:10.530 --> 15:12.530
God, no wonder Amanda thinks
you're a dirty jezzie.

15:12.773 --> 15:14.983
- "A dirty jezzie?"
- Hmm. Oh,

15:15.673 --> 15:16.673
my dad used to say it.

15:17.882 --> 15:19.515
Short for Jezebel,
we'’d be watching Top of the Pops

15:19.539 --> 15:21.403
and he'’d say,
"Look at those dirty Jezzies."

15:21.437 --> 15:23.397
That's it, exactly.
She thinks I'm a dirty Jezzie.

15:23.646 --> 15:25.407
Oh, don't let it get to you.
I mean...

15:26.684 --> 15:29.135
look, if she was a real friend
then it might mean something,

15:29.169 --> 15:30.584
but... Coming Caroline!

15:53.228 --> 15:54.412
Would you like a drink, Amanda?

15:54.436 --> 15:56.076
Oh, no, I never drink
when I'm performing.

15:56.162 --> 15:57.197
- Here ya go.
- Great.

15:57.853 --> 15:59.096
Do you wanna? You can

15:59.130 --> 16:00.450
just pop them in the box
yourself.

16:03.238 --> 16:05.826
- No, you only have to do one.
- Oh, no, I'’m doing Kevin

16:05.861 --> 16:07.261
- and Julia'’s for them.
- Oh, okay.

16:08.588 --> 16:10.521
Don't worry,
I barely touched them.

16:11.694 --> 16:12.694
Sorry?

16:14.801 --> 16:16.481
- Did you think I was funny?
- Yeah. Funny.

16:17.114 --> 16:18.253
- Funny.
- Yeah.

16:18.839 --> 16:20.393
Oh, thank you.

16:24.535 --> 16:27.814
Okay, everybody,
I think that's everyone!

16:27.848 --> 16:29.850
Now, let's get this show
on the road.

16:29.885 --> 16:34.407
Yay! Thanks Caroline, aw.

16:34.441 --> 16:38.583
Okay, and our first one is...

16:39.239 --> 16:41.690
Keith Carter! Where'’s Keith?

16:42.242 --> 16:45.142
There he is! Hello Keith.
And Keith says he'll do a...

16:46.419 --> 16:49.491
portrait of your pet.
That sounds rather lovely.

16:49.836 --> 16:53.081
Um, shall we start the bidding
at ten pounds?

16:53.426 --> 16:54.426
Anyone?

16:55.221 --> 16:56.221
Ten pounds?

16:57.119 --> 16:58.741
Keith, if someone
doesn't have a pet?

16:58.776 --> 17:00.502
Would you do a family member?

17:01.089 --> 17:02.435
Um, I can't do hands.

17:03.436 --> 17:05.162
- Okay.
- Ten pounds.

17:05.472 --> 17:07.543
And we're off!

17:10.443 --> 17:13.894
There you are. I've had
three people asking for you.

17:13.929 --> 17:16.449
Could you please just hang
everything up in the cloakroom?

17:16.483 --> 17:17.795
Caroline, are you kidding?

17:19.072 --> 17:21.523
I've had a brilliant response
to the human cloakroom from...

17:22.869 --> 17:24.353
Keith and...

17:25.458 --> 17:27.701
Keith just loved it. Now, if...

17:28.633 --> 17:31.740
If you'll excuse me.
I really need some water.

17:36.779 --> 17:40.576
Fantastic, Samantha,
there you go, congratulations.

17:43.476 --> 17:46.341
Free haircuts for a week!
I wish I'd bid on that one!

17:46.375 --> 17:49.344
Free haircuts for a week?
Isn't that just one haircut?

17:51.622 --> 17:53.279
Ah!

17:53.900 --> 18:00.113
This next one is very exciting.
Kevin Brady! Where'’s Kevin?

18:01.425 --> 18:02.495
Kevin.

18:03.185 --> 18:07.327
Um, Kevin has offered
a couples massage.

18:08.259 --> 18:10.572
Would anyone like
a couples massage

18:10.606 --> 18:13.092
- from Kevin Brady?
- I didn't put that in.

18:14.576 --> 18:17.717
I mean, I'll do it if you want
but I haven'’t got any training.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.166
I put it in.

18:19.788 --> 18:20.788
I put a few in.

18:21.859 --> 18:23.899
Kevin, I presume that
you'll come to someone's house

18:23.930 --> 18:25.552
or do they have to come to you?

18:27.002 --> 18:29.729
Okay. Well, we can
work that out later.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.938
Uh, shall we start the bidding
at...

18:33.457 --> 18:35.942
twenty-five pounds? Anyone?

18:37.254 --> 18:38.496
Twenty-five pounds.

18:39.256 --> 18:41.879
Come on, who's up
for a lovely couple's massage?

18:42.604 --> 18:43.604
With Kevin.

18:43.950 --> 18:44.951
Give me a drink.

18:46.470 --> 18:47.670
No one's bidding on this shit.

18:48.299 --> 18:50.370
No offence, Kevin, but come on.

18:50.681 --> 18:52.752
What? I didn't write it!
Liz did.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.136
Very generous so far.

18:57.584 --> 18:58.584
Christ, Anne.

18:59.517 --> 19:01.312
- What is in that?
- Liz made it.

19:01.347 --> 19:02.727
- Jesus!
- We can do this.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.326
I'’m watching this thermometer,
come on everyone.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.190
If someone bids on this
you have to do it, Liz!

19:06.593 --> 19:08.595
I'm not giving
a couple a massage!

19:09.044 --> 19:12.427
Okay. Well, no bids
on that one yet,

19:12.772 --> 19:14.394
maybe we'll come back
for it later,

19:14.429 --> 19:18.329
but thank you anyway, Kevin!
Ladies and Gentlemen!

19:22.575 --> 19:24.197
Still haven't done my one yet.

19:24.611 --> 19:25.611
Um...

19:28.063 --> 19:29.063
I know.

19:31.273 --> 19:32.273
Okay.

19:36.244 --> 19:37.244
Secret.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.214
Just a little surprise
for later.

19:42.836 --> 19:45.632
You-you saw... you saw me
after I had the sports jacket?

19:45.667 --> 19:46.840
No. I... I think I...

19:47.841 --> 19:50.879
had the blue anorak... anorak on
when I saw you. That's...

19:50.913 --> 19:53.468
that's here. How could I have
got to this one and not got

19:53.502 --> 19:55.711
to your one? Er...

19:56.471 --> 19:59.957
Oh, wait. I... I had to take them
all off when I went

19:59.991 --> 20:01.683
to the toilet.

20:02.787 --> 20:04.789
Someone'’s phone's ringing.

20:06.688 --> 20:10.450
So that's £45 for a Meal
for two at Al Fresco's

20:10.485 --> 20:13.798
courtesy of Giuseppe and Lorna.
Thanks L and G.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.319
And congratulations Nicky.
Enjoy those dough balls.

20:19.666 --> 20:20.666
Uh oh!

20:22.393 --> 20:23.393
This is my one!

20:23.981 --> 20:26.259
Um, I can't believe I did this.

20:26.846 --> 20:28.779
Anyway, bit of fun. Um...

20:33.370 --> 20:34.612
I auction...

20:36.925 --> 20:37.925
a kiss.

20:39.479 --> 20:40.479
That's right.

20:42.068 --> 20:45.036
A kiss to the highest bidder.

20:47.418 --> 20:49.765
Shall we start the bidding
at £50?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.077
Who wants a kiss

20:51.802 --> 20:53.942
for £50?

20:56.496 --> 20:58.567
Anyone? A kiss from a lady.

21:02.433 --> 21:04.884
Oh, come on, don'’t be shy,
this is for charity.

21:05.712 --> 21:07.956
Anyone? Any bids?

21:08.370 --> 21:09.370
Fifty pence!

21:11.442 --> 21:16.378
Thanks, Liz. Um,
any raise on 50 pence?

21:16.585 --> 21:19.726
Hm? Come on everyone,
this is for children.

21:19.761 --> 21:22.522
For the music Block.
We can get those keyboards.

21:22.557 --> 21:24.317
We'’re so close, come on.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.595
- Anyone?
- A pound.

21:27.009 --> 21:30.461
- No one raised it.
- Oh, 50 pence, still.

21:30.496 --> 21:32.981
So fifty pence still.
Still fifty pence.

21:33.844 --> 21:35.949
Any raise over 50 pence?

21:37.606 --> 21:38.606
A pound?

21:39.470 --> 21:40.550
Anyone want to bid a pound?

21:40.851 --> 21:42.922
- A pound!
- No one raised it.

21:42.956 --> 21:46.443
Oh, sorry, sorry. That's it,
isn't it? Have I won?

21:47.133 --> 21:48.514
No-one else is bidding on it.

21:48.893 --> 21:50.032
Who else? Okay. Well,

21:51.171 --> 21:54.174
I think that Liz is having a bit
of fun with me right now

21:54.209 --> 21:56.591
because I don'’t think that,
um, 50...

22:30.659 --> 22:32.420
There's that phone again.

22:35.526 --> 22:37.873
Can somebody help me find it?

22:37.908 --> 22:39.979
- Look, I really need to leave.
- Let's make

22:40.013 --> 22:43.638
a real push to get
our target up.

22:43.672 --> 22:46.813
We are so close guys
to getting this keyboard.

22:48.574 --> 22:53.475
I know how important music is
to our kids. My son Reuben is...

22:54.096 --> 22:56.202
very musically gifted
and he really found his voice

22:56.651 --> 22:57.931
when he got his first Euphonium.

22:58.584 --> 23:00.413
Which, for those of you
who don't know,

23:00.448 --> 23:02.450
is a dinky little tuba.
So,

23:03.278 --> 23:07.420
let's dig deep and shell out.

23:07.455 --> 23:08.935
Can I... can I grab that
for a minute.

23:09.146 --> 23:12.701
Sorry, um, I-I just wanted
to take this opportunity

23:12.977 --> 23:15.083
to ask the parents,
and everybody here,

23:15.739 --> 23:17.982
to give a massive round
of applause

23:18.017 --> 23:21.883
to Miss Caroline Lacy,
who has organized

23:21.917 --> 23:24.575
this whole bloody thing.
Caroline Lacey.

23:29.718 --> 23:31.686
Thank you so much.

23:32.825 --> 23:33.945
Shall I do the next promise?

23:34.205 --> 23:35.205
Yeah.

23:35.897 --> 23:40.764
Oh, this one
is from Julia Johnstone.

23:40.798 --> 23:41.798
Where's Julia?

23:43.594 --> 23:45.631
Um... I'm-I'm Julia.

23:46.632 --> 23:47.632
Julia?

23:48.875 --> 23:50.014
Of course.

23:51.326 --> 23:53.535
Oh my goodness,
this is an interesting one.

23:53.811 --> 23:56.814
'Maid for a week'!

23:57.781 --> 24:00.853
You'’re going to be someone's
maid for a whole week?

24:00.887 --> 24:03.131
That's wonderful. Oh, my God!

24:03.959 --> 24:06.479
- Julia. Thank you!
- What?

24:06.859 --> 24:08.861
That's so good of you.

24:08.895 --> 24:10.587
Sorry, I don't know
what's happening now?

24:10.621 --> 24:11.667
I think this is a bit
of a special one,

24:11.691 --> 24:13.624
so shall we start it at £25?

24:13.659 --> 24:15.695
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five pounds already!

24:15.730 --> 24:17.328
What is this? I don't know
what's happening now?

24:17.352 --> 24:19.078
- Any advance on 25?
- Thirty pounds!

24:19.527 --> 24:23.669
Anyone else like to bid on Julia
being your maid

24:23.876 --> 24:27.086
for a whole week? I presume
that's weekdays, Julia?

24:27.569 --> 24:31.124
No, no, I-I can't be a-a maid
for a week. I-I can't do this.

24:31.159 --> 24:33.713
I-I can't do the thing
that I'm moving the arrow for.

24:33.748 --> 24:35.301
- Fifty pounds!
- Fifty!

24:35.335 --> 24:37.072
- Thank you.
- No. That'’s wrong as an amount,

24:37.096 --> 24:39.236
- fifty, because I can't...
- A hundred pounds.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.169
- Thank you.
- Two hundred!

24:41.203 --> 24:43.274
Thank you!

24:43.654 --> 24:47.278
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
we did it.

24:47.313 --> 24:49.936
We hit the target. We did it!

24:52.663 --> 24:56.943
We didn't do it! No, no, no, no!
We didn't do it.

24:56.978 --> 24:59.290
We didn'’t do it.
I can't be a maid for a week.

24:59.325 --> 25:02.328
I can't do this.
I... I didn't write this.

25:02.362 --> 25:05.089
This isn't me. I didn'’t do this.
I didn'’t write this.

25:05.124 --> 25:07.644
Can I see that? Can I see that?
Can I see it? Can I see it?

25:07.678 --> 25:09.542
Thank you.
This isn't my handwriting.

25:09.749 --> 25:12.959
Who wrote this? Liz?
I'm so sorry.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.617
Uh, I can't commit to this.
This is some kind of...

25:16.135 --> 25:18.620
someone's idea
of a very funny joke. As a...

25:19.000 --> 25:21.692
I'm a working mother,
and I can't possibly...

25:22.659 --> 25:24.799
be a maid for a week.

25:28.009 --> 25:30.021
Maybe I could do a Saturday,
but I definitely can'’t do

25:30.045 --> 25:32.392
this Saturday because I...
We have to go and see

25:32.427 --> 25:35.154
my husband's family
this Saturday, but I could check

25:35.188 --> 25:37.294
my iCal, there might be
a Saturday at the end

25:37.328 --> 25:39.099
of September? But that would
have to be a very, very,

25:39.123 --> 25:40.228
very light pencil.

25:42.092 --> 25:44.012
I'm so sorry, it'’s just
the practicalities of...

25:47.028 --> 25:49.340
I... I tell you what, listen,
why-why don'’t we just...

25:49.375 --> 25:52.205
Why don'’t we... Let's take it
off the table, off the table,

25:52.240 --> 25:54.173
off the table, off the table,
let'’s start again.

25:54.449 --> 25:56.865
Let'’s start again. Caroline,
what's the next promise?

25:56.900 --> 25:58.798
Julia, please can I have
the microphone back?

25:58.833 --> 26:01.318
No! I'll bid on it, I'’ll bid
on whatever it is.

26:01.352 --> 26:03.700
I will bid on it. Let'’s have
a little look in the box

26:03.734 --> 26:05.943
and we have. Two nights
in a cottage in Margate.

26:05.978 --> 26:08.049
What do we need for the total?
We need £200.

26:08.083 --> 26:11.190
I'’ll pay 200... I'’ll pay £200!

26:11.708 --> 26:15.297
Boom! And we'’ve done it!

26:16.402 --> 26:18.059
We've done it everybody.

26:18.853 --> 26:20.371
Can I get a ooo-ooo?

26:21.787 --> 26:23.029
Ooo-ooo!

26:28.034 --> 26:29.691
We did it!

26:30.312 --> 26:32.729
- Thank you, Julia.
- No problem.

26:33.868 --> 26:36.422
It'’s for a great cause.
Can't believe

26:36.456 --> 26:38.355
I just spent £200
on a shithole in Margate.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.322
That's my summer home.
That was my promise.

26:46.052 --> 26:49.124
Um, I-I-I have a message
for the owner

26:49.159 --> 26:52.265
of the teal Alice coat.

26:52.990 --> 26:56.684
Um, your phone went off
numerous times.

26:56.925 --> 27:00.688
Uh, apparently there's been
a flood in your bathroom.

27:01.758 --> 27:04.243
Uh, the people downstairs
have gone to a hotel

27:04.277 --> 27:07.211
for the night.
Your... your children are safe,

27:07.695 --> 27:09.110
the babysitter's safe,

27:09.973 --> 27:11.353
the fire brigade's been round,

27:11.388 --> 27:13.183
so there's nothing to worry
about there.

27:13.977 --> 27:17.946
Um, the cat is unaccounted for
but it's unlikely

27:17.981 --> 27:20.328
there's a sad ending,
you know cats.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.020
Uh, but unfortunately
it doesn't sound

27:23.055 --> 27:25.436
like the hallway rug
is salvageable.

27:26.368 --> 27:29.199
So, um, so hit me up at the back
of the hall

27:29.233 --> 27:30.273
if you want to call Jenny.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.721
Although, she says
there'’s not a lot you can do

27:33.755 --> 27:35.205
about it now so,

27:35.930 --> 27:37.794
so, enjoy... enjoy your evening.

27:40.831 --> 27:41.831
Um.

27:42.730 --> 27:45.422
Although, the evening is,
of course, over.
