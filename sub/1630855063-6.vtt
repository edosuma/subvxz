WEBVTT

01:23.500 --> 01:24.585
All right. See ya.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.890
- You hungry?
- You know I work in a restaurant, right?

01:38.473 --> 01:40.434
Right. Yeah. Go get some takeout.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.062
I haven't had food poisoning in a while
so I'm probably overdue.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.899
The customers love everything
but the food.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.277
That I believe. What's not to like?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.290
It's pretty good.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.126
Gonna watch with me?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.377
I don't know if you've ever heard
of the LSAT

02:08.377 --> 02:10.339
but it's actually kind of hard.

02:10.339 --> 02:14.343
You crushed the last two pre-tests.
You can relax for 15 minutes.

02:14.343 --> 02:17.596
- I'll watch the last five.
- Yeah. Now you're talking.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.057
Shit!

02:25.938 --> 02:27.272
Holy shit.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.775
That's gotta be a flat.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.696
Can't find a jack.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.782
I think we're going
to have to call Triple A.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.116
Can I borrow your cell?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.661
Already texting my dad.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.081
This is how you want me
to meet your father?

02:44.081 --> 02:45.249
It's fine.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.668
I smell like curly fries.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.877
I like curly fries.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.673
Just relax.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.924
This is not what you think.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.556
Do you have any idea
how dangerous Nicholas Bell is?

03:00.556 --> 03:02.641
He's one of the most notorious mob lawyers
in the country.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.601
He was consigliere
to the Campano organization.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.437
Consigliere? What is this, <i>The Godfather</i>?

03:07.437 --> 03:10.023
No, this is the most sophisticated
organized crime syndicate

03:10.023 --> 03:11.984
in North America.
They've got more money than God

03:11.984 --> 03:13.694
and none of the quaint charms
of Vito Corleone.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.153
I get it. They're dangerous.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.239
You don't get it.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.951
These are nameless, faceless, brutal men.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.080
The evidence your husband provided
put eight high-level members

03:25.080 --> 03:28.000
of the organization behind bars,
in addition to Nicholas Bell.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.127
That's why he had to disappear.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.714
Which he managed to do pretty successfully
until The Shop made national news.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.508
Why didn't Owen leave The Shop?

03:37.551 --> 03:40.137
Why didn't he just quit when he realized
what Avett was doing?

03:41.305 --> 03:43.974
Might have been too late,
or maybe Avett had something on him.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.644
- He threatened me...
- Avett?

03:47.644 --> 03:48.729
Over the phone.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.774
He said something
about how Owen's history didn't line up.

03:52.774 --> 03:57.070
Yeah. Owen would have had to try
and fix things from the inside,

03:58.113 --> 03:59.239
and when he couldn't--

03:59.907 --> 04:01.200
Is that Owen's?

04:03.535 --> 04:04.411
He sent it to me.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.122
Owen kept track of everything
that happened at The Shop.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.125
Formal memos, emails.
It's a log of what Avett was doing.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.127
How Owen tried to fix it.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.214
So why didn't Owen just go to the FBI
and explain?

04:16.214 --> 04:18.841
He would have been in danger
as soon as the FBI took his prints.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.346
Campanos have people everywhere.
He couldn't take that risk. He had to run.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.310
If these people find Bailey--

04:28.310 --> 04:29.394
They're not gonna.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.689
You don't know that.
You have no idea where she is.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.650
I got a dozen officers
combing the streets.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.944
- They're gonna find her.
- What if they don't?

04:37.694 --> 04:41.448
- You expect me to just sit here--
- You are in just as much danger as Bailey.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.159
I cannot have you out there. So, yeah.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.538
I want you to sit here and talk
to me about what's gonna happen

04:47.538 --> 04:48.956
when we bring her back in.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.209
What's going to happen
is we're leaving Austin.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.629
- Going home.
- Hannah, you're not listening.

04:55.629 --> 04:59.174
There is no going home. Not anymore.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.019
This is crazy.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.359
Shit.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.075
Hi.

05:25.701 --> 05:26.785
Who are you?

05:29.246 --> 05:30.581
Oh, my God.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.083
I was just leaving.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.962
Hey, wait.
And, boys, go to your room. Now.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.805
You should come inside. Please.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.566
A girl just went in the house.
Could be her.

05:57.566 --> 05:58.817
<i>On my way.</i>

06:19.379 --> 06:20.380
Mr. Bell?

06:22.007 --> 06:23.258
None of that.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.886
Please, call me Nicholas.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.639
Nice to meet you. Ethan.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.350
About time. Kate talks about you a lot.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.727
Most of it's good.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.146
Well, this wasn't exactly
the way I wanted to meet you, sir.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.273
I don't know.
There are worse ways to meet.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.652
You don't have to worry
about me forgetting your name.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.450
There is such a thing
as studying too much.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.786
Not if you're trying
to get into a good law school.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.037
Okay, smart-ass.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.249
How about getting out of the car
and letting us get to work?

06:56.583 --> 06:57.751
Thanks for coming, Dad.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.549
Now don't scare him off, okay?

07:03.549 --> 07:05.259
- Who, me?
- Dad.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.353
How much do you know about WITSEC?

07:16.353 --> 07:19.439
Witness Protection?
Seems a little extreme, doesn't it?

07:21.483 --> 07:22.484
See for yourself.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.868
These guys wear Brioni suits,
join country clubs,

07:30.868 --> 07:32.286
and tell their neighbors they work
in securities.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.996
That's how the new regime operates

07:34.496 --> 07:39.668
quietly, efficiently, and without mercy.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.463
Jesus.

07:44.756 --> 07:45.674
Yeah.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.219
They send the same kind of messages guys
like this have always sent.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.473
This is box 23 of 101, by the way.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.184
Go through them all
if you need more convincing.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.687
No. That's okay. I got it.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.440
I just--

08:02.900 --> 08:07.613
Was Owen-- Ethan involved in all this?

08:10.199 --> 08:12.284
Let's just say once you're
in Nicholas Bell's orbit,

08:12.284 --> 08:14.203
it's hard to keep the shit off your shoes.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.626
- Need some help with that?
- Nope.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.548
All right. We're good.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.640
So you grew up in Midway?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.058
Yeah. Just a little outside.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.813
Well, my brother spent some time
not too far from there.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.732
Yeah? Whereabouts?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.776
Texas State Penitentiary.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.446
Cops found a joint
in his glove compartment.

08:50.572 --> 08:54.159
Was a petty drug charge
but it wasn't his first so...

08:56.161 --> 08:58.121
he was in for a long time.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.252
And the thing that always got me
was that he would have walked

09:03.252 --> 09:04.628
with a halfway decent lawyer,

09:05.838 --> 09:07.256
but we were dirt poor,

09:08.257 --> 09:11.343
and the court-appointed moron
slept his way through the trial.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.597
Is that why you became a defense lawyer?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.017
One of the reasons.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.022
You like that car?

09:24.606 --> 09:25.649
Wait till you drive it.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.278
I'm a little rusty on stick.
Not sure that's a good idea.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.865
Are you serious about my daughter?

09:36.618 --> 09:37.619
Yes, sir.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.084
Well, good.
I can live with you burning out my clutch.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.759
How much did he tell you about them?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.845
Not a lot.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.100
What do you remember?

10:02.394 --> 10:05.731
I remember you... A little.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.445
Yeah, you loved our backyard.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.948
You used to spend a lot of time here.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.081
I don't understand any of this.

10:29.213 --> 10:33.842
Something happened a long time ago
with your grandfather and your father.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.096
Your dad, he had to go.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.058
He had to take you, and go.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.352
Why?

10:44.311 --> 10:47.856
It's complicated.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.236
Three days ago, my dad disappeared

10:54.029 --> 10:56.490
and then I learned that he lied to me

10:56.490 --> 10:58.242
about literally my whole life.

10:58.242 --> 11:00.410
My name, my birthday. Everything.

11:02.496 --> 11:06.124
So-- I appreciate the fact
that you're not lying to me.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.128
But could you please explain
what's going on?

11:14.591 --> 11:16.677
A lot of people talk
about saving the world.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.846
I say, start in your own backyard.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.057
What?

11:23.475 --> 11:26.144
Don't tell me you're one of those rubes
who think prosecutors are the good guys?

11:26.770 --> 11:28.730
It's not really my area of expertise.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.441
Okay, well, it's mine.
And let me tell you.

11:32.442 --> 11:37.322
Public defenders' offices are underfunded
and understaffed,

11:37.322 --> 11:40.367
and it makes for a shitty defense
for people who need it the most.

11:40.868 --> 11:45.372
People who have nothing.
People who grew up like you and I did.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.458
You know that 60%
of my clients are pro bono?

11:49.251 --> 11:50.544
I'm not saying I'm a saint.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.131
And, obviously,

11:54.131 --> 11:56.466
I have some colorful clients
who pay the bills

11:57.009 --> 11:58.969
but they deserve a fair trial too.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.472
And you'll be surprised
at how many of them are innocent.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.809
Of what they've been charged at least.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.689
<i>Nicholas had a real hold on your husband.</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:12.191
Owen loved Kate.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.402
And Nicholas was so damn charming,
so worldly.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.154
He was a poor kid, like Owen.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.114
Picked himself up.
Had everything Owen wanted.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.033
Great family, great life.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.870
- Did Owen go to work for him?
- No.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.249
But when Nicholas asked Owen for help,
Owen obliged.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.419
- "Help?"
- When you defend people like this,

12:32.419 --> 12:35.047
there's a line you don't cross
if you want to stay out of jail.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.090
You don't tell them how to evade the law.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.759
You don't help them commit a crime.

12:38.759 --> 12:41.720
And you most certainly don't relay orders
from leadership behind bars

12:41.720 --> 12:43.347
to family members on the outside.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.183
- Nicholas crossed those lines.
- Yeah.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.560
And when he started passing messages
for his clients,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.896
he needed those messages to be protected.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.066
Owen set up
that encryption system for him.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.194
Did he know what was in the messages?

12:57.194 --> 13:01.323
No. Nicholas didn't want Owen exposed
like that and Owen didn't want to know.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.535
At least till Kate was killed.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.623
Owen said that was an accident.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.124
It was a hit-and-run.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.711
It was intentional?

13:15.629 --> 13:16.797
It happened on a quiet street,

13:17.756 --> 13:20.884
exactly one block from the park
where Nicholas took Bailey every Friday.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.594
Jesus.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.472
Nicholas had just refused a big case
for the organization.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.974
They weren't happy with him.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.225
They'd made some threats.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.894
Of course, after Kate was killed,

13:30.894 --> 13:32.938
the Campanos insisted
they weren't responsible,

13:32.938 --> 13:35.941
that it was most likely a competitor
trying to mess with Nicholas's loyalty.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.443
But it didn't matter to Owen.

13:39.403 --> 13:42.281
Owen was convinced someone
in that world had murdered Kate

13:42.281 --> 13:43.824
to send Nicholas a message.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.659
And Nicholas was to blame.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.371
So it was my grandfather's fault?

13:51.957 --> 13:55.127
- He's why my mother was killed?
- It was hard to say.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.338
I prefer not to think that but...

14:00.465 --> 14:04.553
your dad, he got angry with your granddad
and with himself.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.806
He decided to make things right.

14:08.432 --> 14:09.433
What do you mean?

14:11.101 --> 14:13.478
He decided your grandfather's clients
should pay.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.690
How?

14:17.232 --> 14:19.193
<i>Owen had access to everything.</i>

14:19.776 --> 14:22.279
Because it was his encryption system.

14:22.279 --> 14:27.159
Yeah. So he took all the messages
and turned them over to the feds.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.748
It was enough to nail a few key players

14:32.748 --> 14:35.834
and blow up a sizable chunk
of their domestic oxy business.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.086
Of course Nicholas knew more.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.630
The feds tried to flip him, but...

14:40.839 --> 14:42.382
he refused to cooperate.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.303
He did six years instead
of turning on that organization.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.682
Which they appreciated.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.144
But it took a huge toll on his family.

14:54.937 --> 14:58.023
And as far as Nicholas is concerned,
Owen is responsible for all of it.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.193
And that kind
of wound doesn't get smaller over time.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.531
So you guys must love my dad?

15:06.907 --> 15:10.035
I'm not going to lie, it was a dark time.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.080
Your grandfather went to prison.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.792
Your grandmother, she got sick.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.419
We lost her a few years ago.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.339
Charlie and I split right after.

15:26.301 --> 15:30.389
But, look,
that's not the whole story either.

15:31.598 --> 15:36.937
We loved your dad. And you.
And our family.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.773
Things were really happy here.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.401
Until they weren't.

15:46.280 --> 15:51.076
Things change and things fall apart.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.830
All the more reason
to hold on to memories.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.334
What memories?

16:28.071 --> 16:30.449
Pick a photo. I'll tell you the story.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.003
- How far out are you?
- <i>About a half hour.</i>

16:43.003 --> 16:44.630
<i>He's driving as fast as he can.</i>

16:45.214 --> 16:46.548
<i>Let me know if she moves.</i>

16:46.548 --> 16:47.799
You got it.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.433
Hannah.

16:57.935 --> 17:02.064
I know it sounds scary
but we need to talk about WITSEC.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.193
- Why?
- Excuse me?

17:08.278 --> 17:10.405
Why do we have to talk about it?

17:13.951 --> 17:17.079
Because Nicholas Bell is a dangerous man.
There's no telling what he'll do here.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.080
And if the Campanos get ahold of you
or Bailey--

17:19.080 --> 17:20.624
Right. I get it.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.669
But why do we have to talk about it?

17:24.877 --> 17:28.131
Why aren't Bailey
and Owen already in WITSEC?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.469
And, based on what you're saying,
shouldn't they have been put

17:32.469 --> 17:36.598
in witness protection in the first place
back when all this started?

17:37.558 --> 17:38.934
They were supposed to be but...

17:41.019 --> 17:42.938
things didn't go down the way Owen wanted.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.232
What the fuck does that mean, Grady?

17:47.943 --> 17:49.194
There was a leak.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.280
The organization got ahold
of their new identities.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.157
We caught it before the relocation
but Owen was done.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.451
Disappeared on his own.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.037
How'd you know where he was?

17:59.872 --> 18:01.498
He needed some help over the years.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.000
I guess he trusted me.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.085
Why?

18:05.085 --> 18:06.837
I don't know. You'll have to ask him that.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.048
Bailey's phone's been off
for over an hour.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.342
The last known address is the hotel.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.094
And no word from any of our guys
in the field?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.221
- Not yet.
- Okay.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.186
- How do I get an outside line?
- Dial nine. Unless you want privacy.

18:22.686 --> 18:23.770
What do you think?

18:27.649 --> 18:28.483
Who you calling?

18:31.778 --> 18:33.488
- <i>Jules Nichols.</i>
- Hey, it's me.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.698
Where are you?

18:34.698 --> 18:36.575
<i>Still in Austin. Bailey's missing.</i>

18:37.075 --> 18:38.076
Shit.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.120
Jules, I need you to find Bobby.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.706
If anyone will know where Bailey's gone,
it's him.

18:42.706 --> 18:43.874
You don't have his number?

18:43.874 --> 18:47.377
No. But I dropped Bailey at his house
in Mill Valley a couple times.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.754
<i>Okay. Address.</i>

18:48.754 --> 18:50.464
822 Crescent Avenue.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.257
I'm on my way.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.142
He doesn't look...

19:03.727 --> 19:04.728
Dangerous?

19:05.771 --> 19:06.772
Yeah.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.357
What does dangerous look like?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.863
Nothing's black-and-white
with your grandfather.

19:17.533 --> 19:18.992
Or with your father.

19:25.624 --> 19:28.043
You don't hate him?

19:29.711 --> 19:30.712
My dad?

19:33.382 --> 19:35.968
No one wanted things
to happen the way they did.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.806
And we felt that there
were other choices your dad could've made

19:40.806 --> 19:42.558
that we wanted him to make. But...

19:44.226 --> 19:47.521
we understood his anger
and why he felt the only way

19:47.521 --> 19:50.899
to keep you safe was to get you
as far away from Nicholas as possible.

19:52.317 --> 19:57.948
But, I mean you must have been upset
when we just vanished?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.747
That's not exactly how it happened.

20:07.499 --> 20:08.500
What do you mean?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.589
You'd just lost your mom.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.716
Couldn't let you lose your dad too.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.805
Even though we didn't agree
with his decision, ours was clear.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.475
You helped him.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.021
We helped you.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.366
A suspicious death in custody?

20:42.659 --> 20:45.579
Incredible. You are making my night.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.626
Good news on a case.

20:51.168 --> 20:53.295
A suspicious death is good news?

20:54.213 --> 20:55.672
Can be in my line of work.

20:58.217 --> 21:02.137
I didn't mean to sound like I was judging.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.723
- I was just--
- Judging?

21:07.643 --> 21:08.644
Yeah.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.438
I hear you wanna teach.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.108
Yeah, I want to be a professor.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.779
But teaching positions in applied
mathematics aren't easy to come by.

21:19.488 --> 21:21.323
Well, they must love you at UT.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.535
Kate said that you placed
in the Putnam Competition.

21:25.244 --> 21:26.578
I had great professors.

21:26.578 --> 21:30.374
Well, Kate's mother and I
we have friends there.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.835
We can certainly put in
a good word for you.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.838
That's very generous but I am--

21:36.338 --> 21:39.424
I plan to try my luck a lot of places.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.552
- You don't like UT?
- No, I do.

21:41.552 --> 21:43.679
Best school in the greatest state.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.931
Why would you ever want to leave?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.685
It's a big world.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.437
It is smaller than you think.

21:54.857 --> 21:57.860
You will break her mother's heart
if you talk her into leaving Texas.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.033
I don't think I ever talked your daughter
into anything she wasn't already set on.

22:19.923 --> 22:21.341
Why are we taking streets?

22:21.341 --> 22:24.678
There was traffic on the 360 loop.
I thought this would be faster.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.347
Clearly it's not. Let's pick up the pace.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.183
<i>Yeah, I don't understand.</i>

22:30.309 --> 22:33.687
If there was a leak before,
why won't there be a leak this time?

22:34.188 --> 22:36.690
- Because you'll be getting me.
- Owen had you before.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.817
I was junior, I couldn't protect him then.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.527
But I'm in a different position now.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.240
If I believe that,
which I'm not sure I do...

22:47.034 --> 22:48.202
how does this work?

22:49.912 --> 22:52.372
We set you up
with new social security cards,

22:52.372 --> 22:55.083
housing, a stipend,

22:55.083 --> 22:58.337
fake transcripts for Bailey,
help you find a new occupation.

22:59.129 --> 23:00.214
New occupation?

23:01.298 --> 23:03.592
Yeah. You'll need
to give up identifying jobs and hobbies,

23:03.592 --> 23:05.344
things that might make it possible
to track you down.

23:05.344 --> 23:07.054
- And woodworking is--
- Wood turning.

23:07.054 --> 23:09.014
Distinctive. So, that's out.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.599
So is Bailey's theater stuff. And--

23:10.599 --> 23:12.684
Bailey's theater stuff?
It's her whole world.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.728
And no contact with anyone.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.815
We have to assume they'll
be monitoring everyone you now know.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.527
A single phone call
or email could lead them right to you.

23:22.236 --> 23:23.237
Okay.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.449
Putting me aside...

23:31.578 --> 23:36.500
You are asking a 16-year-old
to give up everyone, everything she knows.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.502
Everything she loves.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.089
It's the last thing Owen would want.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.845
If everything you're saying is true,
he had a plan.

23:50.180 --> 23:55.018
I'm pretty sure he left because he
wanted Bailey to be able to stay put.

23:55.936 --> 23:56.937
Maybe.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.731
Maybe. Maybe you're right.

24:01.483 --> 24:02.901
Maybe that was his plan.

24:03.861 --> 24:05.737
Maybe this isn't what he wanted.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.533
But you fucked that all up
when you came to Austin.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.455
I didn't-- I--

24:17.416 --> 24:18.750
Nobody knows who we are.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.794
- We didn't--
- You went to The Never Dry.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.880
Do you know how many cameras
are on that bar?

24:22.880 --> 24:26.800
If Nicholas doesn't already
know who you are, he will soon.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.844
Nicholas Bell wouldn't hurt
his own granddaughter.

24:28.844 --> 24:30.929
Maybe.
But the men he worked for are ruthless.

24:30.929 --> 24:34.308
There's no telling the kind of leverage
they'd use to get Owen to turn himself in.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.439
This can't be the best option.

24:46.945 --> 24:50.490
Owen put me in a good position
to negotiate with the FBI on his behalf.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.744
So he can join you
and Bailey once you're settled.

24:55.704 --> 24:56.830
Once it's safe.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.126
But you have to trust me here.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.505
This is your only option.

25:08.759 --> 25:10.093
I don't trust anyone.

25:11.929 --> 25:13.096
<i>Five bites.</i>

25:13.096 --> 25:14.973
<i>What about one bite?</i>

25:16.350 --> 25:18.435
<i>I think we've got another lawyer
in the family.</i>

25:18.435 --> 25:21.688
<i>It's okay if she doesn't want the bananas.
More for the banana monster</i>.

25:22.189 --> 25:24.316
<i>- I want it.
- What? Really?</i>

25:25.192 --> 25:27.319
<i>Look at that, a lawyer and a charmer.</i>

25:30.364 --> 25:32.407
This is just stuff from our wedding.

25:32.407 --> 25:34.535
- I can fast-forward.
- No. Please.

25:37.496 --> 25:38.497
Sure.

25:44.753 --> 25:50.133
<i>So, if we do this,
Bailey is gonna have to start over again.</i>

25:50.133 --> 25:51.468
Not exactly.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.221
Larry, bring in the thing.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.932
At least now she knows.
And she won't be starting from scratch.

25:56.932 --> 25:57.850
What the--

25:58.809 --> 26:01.436
Thanks, Grady. You picked up
my untransportable sack full of cash.

26:01.436 --> 26:02.688
That's so thoughtful of you.

26:02.688 --> 26:04.648
- You broke into my fucking house.
- I'm sorry.

26:04.648 --> 26:06.733
I didn't think it was a good look
to have this under the bed

26:06.733 --> 26:09.278
of a guy whose tech firm
is under investigation for fraud.

26:10.529 --> 26:11.655
The money is clean.

26:12.155 --> 26:14.032
Owen must have squirreled it away
over the years.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.285
And honestly, you're lucky.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.871
He prepared for this.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.458
He didn't prepare me.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.711
He didn't tell me anything.

26:26.295 --> 26:27.337
Neither of you did.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.381
That was for your safety and Bailey's.

26:30.424 --> 26:31.425
How'd that work out?

26:35.637 --> 26:37.723
He could've told me.
He could've trusted me.

26:42.019 --> 26:44.062
Owen reached out just before he proposed.

26:46.148 --> 26:47.608
That's the last time we talked.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.527
He said he'd never been in love
like that before.

26:52.112 --> 26:53.655
Said you were a game-changer.

26:54.990 --> 26:56.200
It had been ten years.

26:56.825 --> 26:59.536
You can start
to feel safe after ten years.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.832
So when he asked me what I thought,
I told him not to tell you anything.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.418
Actually,
I told him not to marry you at all.

27:06.418 --> 27:07.628
Thanks for that.

27:07.628 --> 27:09.338
He wasn't gonna listen. It's Owen.

27:09.338 --> 27:11.590
You know
how fierce he is about his people.

27:11.590 --> 27:12.674
And he was in love.

27:13.884 --> 27:16.094
But he did want to protect you
from all this.

27:16.845 --> 27:20.140
I told him the only way to do that
was for you to have complete deniability.

27:21.308 --> 27:22.726
That's why he didn't tell you.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.522
He figured it was his burden
to carry alone.

27:28.232 --> 27:31.610
You both underestimated me.
I could've handled this.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.655
Yeah. I know that now.

27:36.782 --> 27:39.117
And it's how I know you're going to do
what you have to here.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.661
To take care of that girl.

27:42.955 --> 27:46.041
Grady, what you're asking me feels wrong.

27:49.294 --> 27:50.337
Because it is.

27:57.511 --> 27:58.512
It's your friend.

27:59.888 --> 28:00.973
Hey, Jules.

28:00.973 --> 28:04.726
Hey. Look, Bobby's got nothing.
He says they haven't spoken, just texted.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.604
- <i>Do you believe him?</i>
- No, not really. But he's not talking.

28:07.604 --> 28:09.773
Are you still there?
Can you put him on the phone?

28:09.773 --> 28:12.317
- <i>Look, Han, I don't think that's--</i>
- Jules, please.

28:15.571 --> 28:16.947
Okay. All right. Give me a sec.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.080
I got it!

28:27.958 --> 28:29.001
What?

28:33.422 --> 28:37.467
<i>Bobby, are you there?
Please, it's important.</i>

28:38.969 --> 28:40.554
Hey, Hannah.

28:40.554 --> 28:41.889
I need to know where she is.

28:41.889 --> 28:44.308
<i>Look, I just talked to Jules.</i>

28:44.308 --> 28:46.810
I know, Bobby. But she's in danger.

28:48.478 --> 28:49.605
What do you mean?

28:49.605 --> 28:50.772
<i>It's complicated.</i>

28:52.274 --> 28:53.525
<i>You need to believe me.</i>

28:53.525 --> 28:56.069
I'd do anything to keep her safe.
I know you would too.

28:56.570 --> 28:58.864
<i>Please, Bobby.
We don't have a lot of time.</i>

28:58.864 --> 29:04.119
Okay. Look, she thought
that maybe this woman was her aunt.

29:04.119 --> 29:05.370
<i>She seemed kind of shook up.</i>

29:05.370 --> 29:08.040
<i>We looked it up on Google
and there was an address.</i>

29:08.040 --> 29:10.042
- Andrea?
- <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

29:10.042 --> 29:11.168
Thank you, Bobby.

29:11.168 --> 29:13.545
- Andrea Reyes' house.
- Yeah. I'm going. Stay here.

29:18.717 --> 29:21.345
This is the Marshal's office.
Request for local backup in Hyde Park,

29:21.345 --> 29:24.723
home of Andrea Reyes,
4872 West 41st Street.

29:25.307 --> 29:26.183
How long?

29:26.183 --> 29:28.477
GPS has us in Hyde Park in less than ten.

29:29.228 --> 29:30.521
I can make it in seven.

29:32.731 --> 29:33.941
Love you, Dad.

29:34.775 --> 29:38.362
Sunday night you'll come to dinner.
Meet my wife, Meredith.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.991
Sure. It's good to meet you, sir.

29:43.617 --> 29:46.203
Don't "sir" me. Makes me feel old.

29:48.497 --> 29:49.665
Be seeing you soon, Ethan.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.520
<i>Did you see Arturo's brother?</i>

30:11.520 --> 30:13.355
<i>Looks like one hell of a linebacker.</i>

30:13.981 --> 30:15.107
<i>That could be our season.</i>

30:16.650 --> 30:17.818
They really got along.

30:17.818 --> 30:20.696
Yeah. Thick as thieves.
Apparently from the night they met.

30:20.696 --> 30:22.322
- <i>Hey, babe</i>.
- <i>Hi, love.</i>

30:22.823 --> 30:24.783
- Your reception was at The Never Dry?
- <i>Where's the peanut?</i>

30:26.243 --> 30:27.244
My idea.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.747
Charlie's grandparents were married there.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.249
- And his parents.
- <i>Wow.</i>

30:32.249 --> 30:33.792
I liked the tradition.

30:36.962 --> 30:39.131
<i>Wow. Oh, yeah.</i>

30:56.064 --> 30:57.065
I just--

30:58.817 --> 31:02.779
I can't believe that I never got to...

31:05.616 --> 31:07.659
That I had a family. But...

31:11.330 --> 31:12.915
You still have a family.

31:39.316 --> 31:40.400
"Next of kin."

31:54.289 --> 31:55.249
Jules Nichols.

31:55.249 --> 31:57.251
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- Did they find her?

31:57.751 --> 31:59.837
<i>Not yet. I can't.</i>

31:59.837 --> 32:03.131
But do you still have the will on you?
Owen's will?

32:03.131 --> 32:04.216
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

32:06.009 --> 32:10.722
Was just wondering who's listed
as Bailey's guardian?

32:10.722 --> 32:13.767
Okay. Give me a sec. Let me pull over.

32:19.982 --> 32:22.359
All right. I've got it. Okay. Let me see.

32:24.778 --> 32:26.446
<i>Well, Hannah, it's you.</i>

32:26.446 --> 32:29.074
<i>You're listed as her guardian
in the event of Owen's death</i>

32:29.074 --> 32:32.619
<i>or his inability
to fulfill parental responsibilities.</i>

32:34.121 --> 32:36.081
Anyone else? Besides me?

32:38.834 --> 32:45.257
Yes. Yeah.
If you're incapable, it's a Charles Smith.

32:45.799 --> 32:48.177
<i>A Charles Smith and an Andrea Reyes.</i>

32:50.721 --> 32:52.639
<i>Hannah, what is going on?</i>

32:53.140 --> 32:54.725
<i>Is there something you're not telling me?</i>

32:55.350 --> 32:57.394
Ms. Hall, Grady's on the phone.
He said it was urgent.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.354
Jules, I gotta go.

33:00.397 --> 33:01.648
- Grady.
- <i>We got her.</i>

33:01.648 --> 33:04.651
<i>We're getting in the car now.
We'll head right back to the station.</i>

33:07.696 --> 33:10.324
Thank God. Can I talk to her?

33:10.324 --> 33:11.491
Yeah, quickly.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.077
Hi.

33:14.661 --> 33:17.164
Bailey. You're okay?

33:17.164 --> 33:19.082
<i>I'm fine. I'm so sorry.</i>

33:19.082 --> 33:21.502
My phone died. I should've told you.

33:22.044 --> 33:23.045
<i>It's okay.</i>

33:24.046 --> 33:25.506
Hannah, she's my aunt.

33:26.006 --> 33:27.591
<i>Andrea's my aunt.</i>

33:27.591 --> 33:31.011
I know. I understand. I'm not mad.

33:37.100 --> 33:42.940
But... I have to do something, Bailey.

33:43.524 --> 33:44.775
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

33:46.026 --> 33:51.240
I just-- I need you to trust me. Okay?

33:51.823 --> 33:53.450
<i>Do you trust me, Bailey?</i>

33:54.243 --> 33:55.869
Yeah, I do.

34:02.251 --> 34:03.377
Okay, good.

34:06.672 --> 34:09.257
Get back here safe. And be nice to Grady.

34:30.987 --> 34:32.114
Yeah.

34:32.114 --> 34:34.574
I need you to call our friend
in the Marshal's office.

35:05.939 --> 35:07.608
Ms. Hall, can I help you?

35:07.608 --> 35:08.901
Going to the restroom.

35:29.004 --> 35:30.088
Hey.

36:56.258 --> 36:57.676
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

36:58.594 --> 37:00.012
You need to take me to him.

37:00.762 --> 37:01.763
What?

37:02.973 --> 37:04.641
I need to talk to your father.
