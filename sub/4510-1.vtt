WEBVTT

02:41.217 --> 02:42.176
Hey!

02:43.844 --> 02:45.221
We did it!

02:45.262 --> 02:46.555
Good luck, soldier.

02:55.105 --> 02:56.453
When's the last time
you saw her?

02:56.640 --> 02:59.015
Our wedding day.
Four years ago.

02:59.485 --> 03:02.235
Let me guess. Met her on Friday,
married her on Sunday,

03:02.236 --> 03:03.582
shipped out on Monday.

03:03.595 --> 03:04.498
Pretty much.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.285
Me, too. I'll bet we don't
even recognize them.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.455
I'd recognize her
anywhere.

04:25.237 --> 04:29.992
<i>I find the pheasant
to be quite pleasant.</i>

04:30.075 --> 04:34.580
I find the pheasant
to be quite pleasant.

04:34.663 --> 04:37.583
<i>How do you find
the wine?</i>

04:37.666 --> 04:39.543
I find the wine
extraordinarily...

04:39.585 --> 04:40.627
Betty?

04:40.711 --> 04:43.088
<i>I prefer to dine
at home alone.</i>

04:43.172 --> 04:44.923
Paul?

04:46.759 --> 04:48.010
Paul!

04:52.306 --> 04:55.058
When I didn't see you
on the dock...

04:55.142 --> 04:57.311
I didn't know you were
coming today.

04:57.394 --> 04:58.479
Didn't you get
my letters?

04:58.562 --> 05:02.691
I started
to read them, I did,

05:02.775 --> 05:04.193
but after the first few,

05:04.234 --> 05:07.446
I couldn't bear to hear
about all that fighting

05:07.529 --> 05:08.947
and the killing.

05:09.031 --> 05:11.408
I wrote you almost
every day.

05:11.492 --> 05:13.911
I know.
And I kept them. Look.

05:16.872 --> 05:18.248
See?

05:18.290 --> 05:23.921
Oh, Paul, even the thought of you
in all that danger,

05:24.004 --> 05:25.422
it was just too much.

05:25.506 --> 05:28.425
I knew if I got them,
you were still alive.

05:28.509 --> 05:30.469
That's all
I cared about...

05:30.552 --> 05:31.929
that you were alive...

05:33.263 --> 05:35.057
safe.

05:35.098 --> 05:37.601
That's all that was
important to me.

05:37.684 --> 05:40.521
Can you forgive me?

05:42.272 --> 05:44.691
Yeah, sure.

05:44.775 --> 05:47.986
I wrote to you.
You got those, right?

05:48.070 --> 05:49.655
Got a few.

05:49.738 --> 05:52.616
I told you
I wasn't a big writer.

05:52.658 --> 05:55.577
<i>I quite agree
the distinction is dubious.</i>

05:55.619 --> 05:57.663
It's a course I'm taking.

05:57.746 --> 05:59.540
Self-improvement.

06:01.208 --> 06:03.627
His name's Armistead.
He makes tons of money.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.420
The whole country's
making money

06:05.504 --> 06:06.964
hand over fist.

06:07.005 --> 06:09.091
You've been away,
out of touch.

06:09.174 --> 06:11.134
You don't know,
but you will.

06:11.176 --> 06:14.805
I went to make sure Mr. Sweeney
held your job, like he promised.

06:14.888 --> 06:17.849
He said you could start
the day you got back.

06:17.933 --> 06:20.310
Just make sure
you wear your uniform.

06:20.394 --> 06:23.313
Who could resist
a war hero?

06:23.355 --> 06:27.109
Of course
I negotiated a raise.

06:27.150 --> 06:32.739
Betty, I don't want
to go back to selling chocolate.

06:32.823 --> 06:35.951
You've got
something better.

06:36.034 --> 06:37.786
No...

06:37.869 --> 06:39.162
I don't.

06:39.246 --> 06:42.833
But, you know...
in the war,

06:42.916 --> 06:46.086
I had time to think about
what's important,

06:46.169 --> 06:48.088
about what I want
out of life

06:48.171 --> 06:50.215
for me, for us.

06:52.092 --> 06:54.303
I wrote you all this
in the letters.

06:54.386 --> 06:57.306
Are we back to those
old letters again?

06:57.347 --> 07:00.100
You want me to read
the letters?

07:00.183 --> 07:03.145
No. It's just you'd understand
what I'm feeling,

07:03.186 --> 07:05.314
what I want.

07:05.355 --> 07:07.524
Sweetie...

07:08.483 --> 07:10.986
Tell me what you want.

07:11.069 --> 07:12.821
I thought...

07:12.863 --> 07:14.489
some time.

07:14.531 --> 07:15.532
Time's money.

07:15.574 --> 07:18.493
I want things, Paulie.

07:20.245 --> 07:23.206
My whole life
I've been without.

07:23.290 --> 07:25.042
I want things.

07:26.752 --> 07:28.336
Don't you want...

07:29.963 --> 07:31.757
things?

07:36.887 --> 07:39.765
And you'll wear your uniform,
won't you?

07:39.848 --> 07:40.766
My uniform?

07:40.849 --> 07:42.267
To sell chocolates...

07:42.350 --> 07:44.311
millions and millions
of them.

07:44.394 --> 07:46.396
Won't you?

07:46.480 --> 07:47.981
Yes.

08:32.107 --> 08:33.735
Here, let me help.

08:33.777 --> 08:36.279
I'm sorry.

08:43.285 --> 08:44.913
He's going to kill me.

08:44.955 --> 08:47.624
It's just glass.
You can replace it easy.

08:50.627 --> 08:51.586
Sorry.

08:51.628 --> 08:53.547
No, no, it's my fault.

08:54.631 --> 08:56.132
Look at this mess.

08:56.174 --> 08:57.634
Here you go.

08:57.717 --> 09:00.220
Are you all right?

09:17.529 --> 09:18.780
Ticket, please.

09:23.410 --> 09:25.036
Had an accident.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.038
Yes.

09:31.835 --> 09:33.169
Thanks.

11:29.285 --> 11:30.245
Hey!

11:30.286 --> 11:32.163
Hey!

11:37.794 --> 11:38.753
Thanks.

11:38.795 --> 11:40.255
Speed you were going,

11:40.296 --> 11:42.924
you could have made
Sacramento before me.

11:44.676 --> 11:46.135
You smell anything?

11:46.177 --> 11:47.470
No.

11:50.098 --> 11:51.266
Phew!

11:54.143 --> 11:55.270
Hi.

11:56.813 --> 11:58.606
Oh, my God.

12:00.483 --> 12:02.777
I'm so embarrassed.

12:02.819 --> 12:04.279
I wanted to apologize,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.030
but you looked
so peaceful.

12:07.448 --> 12:08.908
Apology accepted.

12:14.414 --> 12:16.165
Good book?

12:20.920 --> 12:22.505
Quite a mouthful.

12:22.589 --> 12:25.508
It's required reading.

12:25.592 --> 12:26.843
College?

12:26.926 --> 12:28.845
My master's degree.

12:28.928 --> 12:30.847
Playing hooky?

12:30.930 --> 12:33.641
No. I'm going home.

12:33.725 --> 12:37.103
My family
has a vineyard in Napa.

12:39.147 --> 12:40.106
And you?

12:40.148 --> 12:42.400
Uh, business
in Sacramento.

12:42.483 --> 12:44.819
The train goes
to Sacramento.

12:44.902 --> 12:46.362
My ticket didn't.

12:46.446 --> 12:48.698
I mean, it did
when I got on,

12:48.781 --> 12:49.824
but...

12:49.907 --> 12:50.992
Oh, no.

12:54.954 --> 12:56.664
I think this is yours.

13:00.501 --> 13:01.544
Yup.

13:03.546 --> 13:07.091
I thought it was a mistake.
I'm so sorry.

13:26.110 --> 13:28.029
Is this seat taken?

13:30.114 --> 13:31.741
How are you?

13:31.824 --> 13:35.370
Look, uh, I'm Bill.

13:35.453 --> 13:37.330
This is my buddy
Herman.

13:37.372 --> 13:38.456
And you're, uh...

13:38.539 --> 13:39.916
Not interested.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.252
I had
a girlfriend once

13:43.336 --> 13:44.754
that always
used to say

13:44.837 --> 13:46.255
she was
not interested.

13:46.339 --> 13:49.300
It was never what she meant,
was it, Herman?

13:49.384 --> 13:50.760
Most definitely not.

13:50.843 --> 13:53.304
Not after she
got to know me.

13:53.387 --> 13:54.430
Stop it.

13:54.514 --> 13:55.431
Fellas.

13:55.515 --> 13:58.184
Fellas.

13:58.226 --> 14:00.812
Lady doesn't want
to be bothered.

14:00.895 --> 14:03.356
Just let her be.

14:18.412 --> 14:20.915
Oh, now what are we
going to do?

14:20.957 --> 14:22.375
Shut up, Herman.

14:22.416 --> 14:24.752
I think
he broke my nose.

14:24.794 --> 14:27.213
I got to get
to Sacramento.

14:27.255 --> 14:29.590
Not on this bus,
you don't.

15:10.965 --> 15:13.926
I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

15:16.679 --> 15:19.473
I'm Paul Sutton.

15:19.557 --> 15:21.183
Victoria Aragon.

15:23.477 --> 15:25.438
I'm sorry
about the bus.

15:26.522 --> 15:27.982
I feel terrible.

15:28.024 --> 15:30.318
All the problems
I've caused you.

15:30.401 --> 15:32.320
You should just
keep going.

15:32.403 --> 15:34.196
Who knows what
will happen next?

15:34.280 --> 15:35.698
There's always
the possibility

15:35.781 --> 15:39.076
of a forest fire,
I suppose.

15:41.162 --> 15:43.664
Why aren't you
on the bus?

15:43.706 --> 15:45.666
My stop.

15:49.879 --> 15:51.464
You're waiting
for a ride.

15:51.505 --> 15:54.008
No. No.

15:56.177 --> 15:57.511
A miracle.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.643
He's going to kill me.

16:03.726 --> 16:04.685
Who?

16:04.727 --> 16:06.020
My father.

16:06.062 --> 16:08.898
If you're still worried
about that picture...

16:08.981 --> 16:10.900
It's not about
the picture.

16:10.983 --> 16:12.443
Oh, God.

16:14.153 --> 16:15.780
Look, it's none
of my business,

16:15.863 --> 16:18.908
but if you'd like
to talk about it...

16:34.423 --> 16:37.385
"I was not meant
for the conventions of this world,

16:37.468 --> 16:39.387
"not meant to be
tied down.

16:39.428 --> 16:42.390
I'm a...
free spirit."

16:42.473 --> 16:44.392
Who's a free spirit?

16:44.433 --> 16:46.644
My professor.

16:47.561 --> 16:49.063
He and I were...

16:49.146 --> 16:51.565
We... We were...

16:54.735 --> 16:57.196
I don't think just because
some free spirit

16:57.238 --> 16:58.406
broke up with you...

16:58.489 --> 16:59.990
I'm pregnant.

17:09.416 --> 17:11.752
You're very upset.

17:11.794 --> 17:13.295
I can understand that.

17:13.378 --> 17:15.881
Definitely understand that.

17:17.715 --> 17:21.303
But, Victoria,
look at the positive side.

17:21.387 --> 17:23.763
It's a new life
coming into the world.

17:23.806 --> 17:25.391
That's a miracle
in itself, right?

17:25.473 --> 17:28.435
"I will kill anyone
who dishonors my family."

17:28.477 --> 17:31.438
How many times
has he said that?

17:31.522 --> 17:33.065
A hundred times,
a million times?

17:33.149 --> 17:35.776
I'm sure it's just
a figure of speech.

17:35.860 --> 17:38.279
My father means
what he says.

17:38.362 --> 17:39.947
Always.

17:40.948 --> 17:44.076
He's... He's very
old-fashioned.

17:45.286 --> 17:48.664
If I come home this way
without a husband,

17:48.747 --> 17:50.124
he'll kill me.

17:50.207 --> 17:52.960
I know he will.

18:04.513 --> 18:07.641
How about if you do show up
with a husband?

18:08.767 --> 18:10.144
Who does what,

18:10.227 --> 18:13.439
comes for the day
and then just leaves?

18:13.480 --> 18:16.483
Sure. Comes to meet the family,
stays one night,

18:16.525 --> 18:17.943
leaves in the morning,

18:17.985 --> 18:19.111
writes a letter
saying he's...

18:19.194 --> 18:21.405
Abandoned me.

18:24.199 --> 18:25.492
It happens.

18:34.251 --> 18:37.254
You're very kind
for trying to help me.

18:37.338 --> 18:40.799
Maybe it might work...

18:40.841 --> 18:42.134
but...

18:45.721 --> 18:47.514
there's nobody.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.523
Miss Aragon.

18:56.607 --> 18:58.275
Victoria.

18:59.318 --> 19:01.111
There's me.

19:02.821 --> 19:05.199
Was it horrible,
the fighting?

19:05.282 --> 19:08.202
Once the shooting starts,
you just go blank.

19:08.285 --> 19:11.246
The trick was to get your mind
on something else.

19:11.330 --> 19:12.873
What did you do?

19:14.667 --> 19:16.835
Write letters
to my wife.

19:16.877 --> 19:18.337
In my head.

19:18.379 --> 19:21.382
Then later, I would
write them down.

19:21.423 --> 19:22.716
About the war.

19:22.800 --> 19:27.388
About what I'd like
our life to be like when I got home...

19:27.471 --> 19:29.306
The perfect little house,

19:29.390 --> 19:32.434
kids running around
in the yard with the dog,

19:32.518 --> 19:34.853
great job.

19:34.895 --> 19:36.522
She must have cherished
every word.

19:36.563 --> 19:39.483
Yeah, every word.

19:39.566 --> 19:42.277
You're very kind
to do this for me.

19:42.361 --> 19:43.821
And the baby.

19:43.904 --> 19:46.448
I'm doing it
for the both of you.

19:46.532 --> 19:50.869
Then we both thank you.

19:50.911 --> 19:52.538
You're both welcome.

20:19.731 --> 20:21.984
We call it Las Nubes.

20:22.985 --> 20:24.653
It means the clouds.

20:25.571 --> 20:27.865
It's beautiful.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.576
Yeah.

20:33.704 --> 20:38.250
Well, if we're going
to do this right...

20:48.635 --> 20:50.846
The wedding bonbon
deluxe.

20:55.392 --> 20:56.935
Big seller
around June.

21:38.852 --> 21:40.354
We're unarmed.

21:43.398 --> 21:45.359
Don't shoot.

21:49.529 --> 21:51.031
Hello, Papa.

21:51.114 --> 21:52.658
Victoria.

21:55.035 --> 21:56.578
Who's this?

21:56.662 --> 21:58.747
Paul Sutton...

21:58.830 --> 22:01.083
my husband.

22:02.626 --> 22:05.087
Marie!

22:05.170 --> 22:06.380
Marie!

22:06.421 --> 22:07.881
It'll be O.K.

22:07.923 --> 22:10.509
Like hell
it'll be OK!

22:10.592 --> 22:12.552
I will not
allow this.

22:12.594 --> 22:15.055
I'll go to the pope
himself

22:15.097 --> 22:16.556
to get this undone.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.684
We weren't married
in a church.

22:19.976 --> 22:21.436
Marie!

22:21.520 --> 22:23.355
<i>¿Qué pasa, Alberto?</i>

22:23.397 --> 22:24.439
Mama.

22:24.523 --> 22:27.067
Victoria!

22:28.068 --> 22:29.236
<i>¿Cuál es
el problema?</i>

22:29.277 --> 22:30.737
Here is the problem.

22:30.821 --> 22:33.031
Is this how
you were brought up?

22:33.073 --> 22:35.242
To betray
your mother?

22:35.325 --> 22:36.743
Betray your father?

22:36.827 --> 22:38.787
I did not betray
anyone.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.747
What are you
talking about?

22:40.831 --> 22:43.250
What do you think
I'm talking about?

22:43.333 --> 22:45.252
The gringo.

22:45.293 --> 22:46.962
His name is Paul.

22:47.045 --> 22:48.380
<i>Mi hijita linda.</i>

22:48.422 --> 22:49.548
<i>Abuelita.</i>

22:51.883 --> 22:54.469
I told you.
I told you!

22:54.553 --> 22:57.389
A girl's place
is here, at home!

22:58.890 --> 23:00.100
Here!

23:00.142 --> 23:02.060
Not alone in some city

23:02.102 --> 23:04.938
doing God knows what.

23:05.021 --> 23:07.774
I'm going to school there.
That's what I'm doing.

23:07.816 --> 23:09.901
What is going on?

23:09.943 --> 23:12.779
Your daughter,
she is married!

23:12.821 --> 23:14.531
<i>Felicidades,
querida.</i>

23:14.614 --> 23:15.574
Mama!

23:15.657 --> 23:17.075
Grandpa,
make him stop.

23:17.117 --> 23:18.076
Please.

23:18.118 --> 23:21.455
Ha! That's right.
That's right.

23:21.496 --> 23:22.456
Coddle her.

23:22.497 --> 23:24.499
The whole bunch of you.

23:24.583 --> 23:27.002
But I tell you right now,

23:27.085 --> 23:31.006
this will not stand
so long as I draw breath.

23:31.089 --> 23:33.341
I swear before God.

23:33.425 --> 23:34.551
Alberto!

23:34.634 --> 23:36.011
You are so unfair.

23:36.094 --> 23:38.013
Me? Ha ha!
I'm unfair?

23:38.096 --> 23:40.807
I came home
to tell my family

23:40.849 --> 23:43.351
that I spit
on their trust?

23:43.435 --> 23:45.562
I'm the one
who came home

23:45.645 --> 23:48.523
to rub in their face
that I married this...

23:48.607 --> 23:50.233
this...

23:50.317 --> 23:52.819
What do you do?

23:52.903 --> 23:54.446
Chocolate.

23:54.488 --> 23:56.990
I sell chocolate.

24:04.372 --> 24:06.666
No.

24:08.418 --> 24:09.336
You...

24:09.419 --> 24:12.339
You are the head
of the family.

24:12.422 --> 24:13.673
Say something.

24:19.638 --> 24:21.514
I am Pedro Aragon.

24:21.598 --> 24:24.851
Welcome
to our happy family.

24:26.353 --> 24:27.646
Thank you.

24:28.939 --> 24:30.190
May I?

24:30.232 --> 24:31.358
Sure.

24:31.441 --> 24:32.484
Of course.

24:41.660 --> 24:42.369
Help yourself.

24:55.715 --> 24:57.175
<i>¡Cierra la puerta!</i>

25:01.680 --> 25:03.682
It's wonderful!

25:05.767 --> 25:07.686
It's wonderful!

25:10.605 --> 25:13.024
Why can he never just say,

25:13.066 --> 25:15.026
"I'm happy for you.
Congratulations, Victoria"?

25:15.068 --> 25:17.028
Why must everything
be a drama?

25:17.070 --> 25:19.030
It's a bit
of a shock.

25:19.072 --> 25:20.573
Not for Grandma
or Grandpa.

25:20.615 --> 25:22.450
Not for you.

25:22.534 --> 25:24.953
Why is he
always this way?

25:25.036 --> 25:26.454
I hate him!

25:26.538 --> 25:27.497
Victoria!

25:27.580 --> 25:28.999
He is your father.

25:29.082 --> 25:31.501
He has never
taken change well.

25:31.584 --> 25:34.462
Even as a child,
he was this way.

25:34.546 --> 25:37.465
Only with the vines
he has patience.

25:37.549 --> 25:40.468
Maybe he should have
some for us, too.

25:40.552 --> 25:43.471
That would be nice
for a change.

25:43.555 --> 25:46.015
You could have
at least prepared us.

25:46.099 --> 25:48.476
A call, a letter
would have been wiser.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.978
I wanted to surprise you.

25:50.061 --> 25:51.521
Well, you certainly
succeeded.

25:51.604 --> 25:54.482
He wants me to marry
some man in Mexico

25:54.566 --> 25:55.984
I have never even met

25:56.067 --> 25:58.445
just because he has
the right bloodlines.

25:58.528 --> 25:59.946
I'm not a horse, Mama.

25:59.988 --> 26:04.451
It's my choice
who I marry, not his.

26:04.534 --> 26:06.453
<i>Muchachas,
la comida.</i>

26:06.494 --> 26:09.456
How many times
have you told me,

26:09.539 --> 26:12.459
"The heart wants
what the heart wants"?

26:12.500 --> 26:15.462
And is this what
your heart wants?

26:15.545 --> 26:16.463
Yes.

26:16.504 --> 26:18.214
Really and truly?

26:19.758 --> 26:21.384
Really and truly.

26:21.468 --> 26:24.220
Everything
will be fine. You'll see.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.598
Everything
will be perfect.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.112
What a delicate ring.

26:41.154 --> 26:43.990
You are beautiful
tonight.

26:46.367 --> 26:48.328
Marriage becomes her,
no?

26:48.369 --> 26:50.872
Mama?

26:52.123 --> 26:56.002
Dear God, bless this food
we are about to eat,

26:56.085 --> 27:00.507
and bless the harvest
of the grapes you have given us

27:00.590 --> 27:04.594
in your wisdom
and grace, amen.

27:04.677 --> 27:06.137
- Amen.
- Amen, amen.

27:06.221 --> 27:08.181
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

27:09.766 --> 27:11.726
This is pumpkin
flower soup.

27:11.809 --> 27:14.354
It's a specialty
of my grandmother's.

27:26.241 --> 27:27.367
It's delicious.

27:28.993 --> 27:30.870
It's been in the family
cookbook

27:30.954 --> 27:34.916
before your Declaration
of Independence was signed.

27:37.669 --> 27:40.713
So, with all the commotion,

27:40.797 --> 27:44.759
we never heard the whole story
of how you two met.

27:47.804 --> 27:50.181
I was on leave in June.

27:50.223 --> 27:51.391
July.

27:51.474 --> 27:54.018
Just after I moved
to the city.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.561
That's right. July.

27:55.603 --> 27:58.064
At the USO.

27:59.649 --> 28:02.277
I didn't know
you worked at the USO.

28:03.361 --> 28:05.905
I wasn't actually
working there.

28:05.989 --> 28:07.907
Then what were you doing

28:07.949 --> 28:11.452
in a hall filled
with strange men?

28:12.912 --> 28:14.163
Pedro.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.584
<i>Mi abuelo vivió a...</i>

28:18.626 --> 28:19.877
Excuse me.

28:20.753 --> 28:24.048
My grandfather lived
to 102,

28:24.090 --> 28:27.093
and he used salt
like a fish in the sea.

28:27.135 --> 28:32.098
My great-grandfather
was 106!

28:36.811 --> 28:40.273
So, tell us, Mr. Sutton,

28:40.356 --> 28:45.737
since we now have such a clear picture
of how you two met...

28:46.738 --> 28:49.240
where are you from?

28:49.323 --> 28:51.367
Moline. Moline, Illinois.

28:53.661 --> 28:55.121
Wherever that is.

28:55.163 --> 28:58.374
It's in the middle
of the country.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.251
Exactly in the middle,
right?

29:01.836 --> 29:02.920
Right.

29:04.547 --> 29:06.090
And your parents,

29:06.174 --> 29:08.259
they are
still in Moline?

29:09.385 --> 29:11.137
I never knew my parents.

29:11.220 --> 29:14.474
Oh. Who brought you up,

29:14.557 --> 29:16.309
the fairies?

29:19.312 --> 29:21.189
I grew up in a home.

29:21.272 --> 29:22.815
Whose home?

29:22.899 --> 29:25.526
I meant an orphanage.

29:25.610 --> 29:28.112
Wonderful.

29:29.155 --> 29:31.282
This is just wonderful.

29:31.365 --> 29:34.076
My daughter
can trace her ancestors

29:34.160 --> 29:35.536
back 400 years

29:35.620 --> 29:38.539
to some of the finest families
in Mexico,

29:38.623 --> 29:40.875
and you are telling me

29:40.958 --> 29:43.461
she has married a man
with no past?

29:43.503 --> 29:45.004
Or worse...

29:45.046 --> 29:47.840
a man with no past

29:47.924 --> 29:50.051
and no future!

29:50.134 --> 29:51.552
Wonderful.

29:51.636 --> 29:54.514
You don't know
that he has no future.

29:54.597 --> 29:56.516
You don't know
anything about him.

29:56.557 --> 29:58.309
Do you?

29:58.351 --> 30:02.647
Yes. I know he knows
how to love somebody.

30:02.688 --> 30:08.194
I know he wants a house
with kids and a dog.

30:08.277 --> 30:09.904
A great job.

30:09.987 --> 30:13.115
You mean,
like the one he has?

30:18.371 --> 30:19.789
Excuse me.

30:19.872 --> 30:21.332
It was very good.

30:21.374 --> 30:22.708
Thank you.

30:55.408 --> 30:58.286
He doesn't pull
any punches, does he?

30:58.369 --> 30:59.745
I'm sorry.

30:59.829 --> 31:02.081
You must think
they're horrible.

31:04.083 --> 31:05.876
When I was a kid...

31:05.918 --> 31:09.380
every night I'd climb
up to the roof of the orphanage,

31:09.422 --> 31:13.884
and I'd make a wish
on every star I could see.

31:13.968 --> 31:15.928
That's a lot of wishing.

31:15.970 --> 31:18.931
It usually boiled down
to one wish, really.

31:18.973 --> 31:20.391
What was that?

31:20.433 --> 31:22.393
What you have in there.

31:22.435 --> 31:23.894
Everyone always
telling you

31:23.936 --> 31:26.397
how you should
live your life?

31:26.439 --> 31:29.650
Better than having
no one telling you.

31:31.902 --> 31:35.072
I don't know
about that.

31:35.114 --> 31:36.532
I do.

31:37.908 --> 31:41.328
That's no reason
for him to treat you that way.

31:42.580 --> 31:43.706
No.

31:45.791 --> 31:49.003
And I was going
to say something, but...

31:50.337 --> 31:52.798
I thought,
"What if it were me?

31:52.840 --> 31:55.259
"A strange man
comes into my house,

31:55.301 --> 31:57.803
"tells me he's married
my only daughter,

31:57.845 --> 31:59.722
and I'm the last to know?"

31:59.805 --> 32:01.474
Probably act the same way.

32:01.557 --> 32:02.975
No, you wouldn't.

32:04.185 --> 32:05.770
I don't know
about that.

32:05.811 --> 32:07.229
I do.

32:19.075 --> 32:22.578
It's only another
eight hours,

32:22.661 --> 32:26.248
I'll be back
on the road.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.878
Anyway, I think
the worst part's over, don't you?

32:44.350 --> 32:47.228
This bed
was part of my dowry

32:47.311 --> 32:49.563
when I married
Mr. Aragon.

32:49.647 --> 32:51.607
It was my grandmother's
before that.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.484
Her dowry.

32:53.526 --> 32:57.571
She had it brought
all the way from Paris.

32:57.655 --> 33:00.825
He was a diplomat,
my grandfather.

33:00.866 --> 33:03.786
And this is
where we've spent

33:03.869 --> 33:06.205
our first
wedding nights,

33:06.288 --> 33:08.415
my mother...

33:08.499 --> 33:10.167
my grandmother...

33:10.251 --> 33:12.253
and me.

33:12.336 --> 33:14.755
We can sleep
in Pedro's room.

33:14.839 --> 33:17.216
In that teeny-tiny
little bed

33:17.299 --> 33:19.593
on your
wedding night?

33:19.677 --> 33:23.222
<i>Ay, hija, no.</i>

33:23.305 --> 33:25.391
You need room...

33:25.474 --> 33:26.809
to maneuver.

33:26.892 --> 33:28.519
Mommy!

33:28.602 --> 33:32.064
I know this is not
your first night together,

33:32.106 --> 33:35.109
but I would like
to think it is.

33:36.277 --> 33:39.738
It's just that
from the beginning,

33:39.822 --> 33:43.867
all our marriages
have been so blessed.

33:43.951 --> 33:47.788
You know,
it is out of love

33:47.871 --> 33:50.791
that my husband roars so.

33:50.874 --> 33:53.294
We are very traditional
people, Paul,

33:53.377 --> 33:58.549
and this modern world
takes a little getting used to.

34:00.968 --> 34:02.261
He'll come around.

34:14.940 --> 34:17.025
Love each other...

34:17.109 --> 34:19.152
always.

34:37.420 --> 34:40.882
First he comes into my house,
steals my daughter.

34:40.966 --> 34:43.844
And now...
Now he takes my bed?

34:43.927 --> 34:45.012
No!

34:45.094 --> 34:46.013
<i>Vida...</i>

34:46.096 --> 34:47.848
You don't want to see it,

34:47.931 --> 34:49.891
but your daughter
is a woman.

34:49.975 --> 34:51.393
And she was not stolen

34:51.476 --> 34:53.353
any more
than you stole me.

34:53.437 --> 34:56.398
Or have you forgotten
that little room under the stairs

34:56.482 --> 34:59.318
in my father's house, hmm?

34:59.359 --> 35:01.820
I asked for
your hand properly,

35:01.862 --> 35:03.864
with respect.

35:06.158 --> 35:07.534
Who is he?

35:07.618 --> 35:08.619
He is nobody.

35:08.660 --> 35:12.039
He is her choice,
and she is our daughter.

35:12.122 --> 35:16.585
Alberto, it is from us
that she has learned to be who she is.

35:16.668 --> 35:19.046
If we don't have
confidence in her,

35:19.129 --> 35:21.590
how can we have confidence
in ourselves?

35:21.673 --> 35:24.051
First you go
and wish them good night

35:24.134 --> 35:26.095
so they won't go to bed

35:26.178 --> 35:28.555
thinking that you're
furious with them.

35:28.639 --> 35:30.099
But I am!

35:31.183 --> 35:33.102
I am furious
with them.

35:35.979 --> 35:37.356
You should smile more.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.275
You are so handsome
when you smile.

35:45.531 --> 35:48.033
First go
and wish them good night.

35:48.117 --> 35:49.993
Go.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.872
Do you like
selling chocolate?

35:53.956 --> 35:56.208
No, not really.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.460
Why are you
doing it?

36:00.087 --> 36:02.506
It's part of
what I thought

36:02.548 --> 36:04.508
I'd use
this trip for,

36:04.550 --> 36:07.010
try and figure
things out for myself.

36:07.052 --> 36:09.471
But you have things
figured out.

36:09.555 --> 36:11.098
It's not that easy.

36:12.558 --> 36:14.893
It's complicated.

36:14.935 --> 36:17.938
It doesn't sound
that complicated to me.

36:19.439 --> 36:21.316
You're not married.

36:25.112 --> 36:27.239
I'm sorry.

36:29.783 --> 36:32.911
It's just not a good time
for me now.

36:38.625 --> 36:40.919
You've been wonderful...

36:40.961 --> 36:42.546
more than wonderful.

36:45.591 --> 36:48.010
Would you
turn around, please?

36:53.098 --> 36:56.268
There'll be someone
for you, Victoria.

36:57.603 --> 37:00.480
You don't have to
make me feel better.

37:00.564 --> 37:01.982
No, I believe that.

37:02.065 --> 37:04.985
I believe that there's
a perfect someone for everyone,

37:05.068 --> 37:07.613
someone who'll love you
no matter what.

37:13.452 --> 37:14.995
Would you marry
someone

37:15.078 --> 37:18.999
if it wasn't your baby
they were carrying?

37:19.082 --> 37:21.501
If I loved her.

37:23.587 --> 37:24.796
Good night.

37:26.089 --> 37:27.299
Good night.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.013
May I?

37:33.096 --> 37:34.931
One moment, Papa.

37:47.110 --> 37:49.529
Your mother
sent me to wish you

37:49.613 --> 37:51.198
good night.

37:51.281 --> 37:52.699
Good night, Papa.

37:52.783 --> 37:55.202
Good night,
Mr. Aragon.

37:56.244 --> 37:57.412
Good night.

38:07.547 --> 38:09.508
Does the door
have a lock?

38:09.549 --> 38:10.509
No.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.010
Do you think
he suspects?

38:12.052 --> 38:13.887
I don't know.

38:15.389 --> 38:17.349
Better not take
the chance.

38:17.432 --> 38:20.352
In case he comes back,
I should stay.

38:20.435 --> 38:21.520
Yes.

38:33.073 --> 38:34.407
Good night.

39:31.548 --> 39:34.968
Victoria!

39:35.051 --> 39:36.928
Victoria!

39:38.305 --> 39:39.764
It's all right.

39:39.806 --> 39:41.558
It's all right.

39:43.101 --> 39:44.519
Just a dream.

39:44.603 --> 39:46.479
It's nothing.

39:51.109 --> 39:53.028
Must be the change...

39:53.111 --> 39:55.363
coming home,
everything so fast.

39:58.491 --> 40:01.077
What's the matter?

40:01.119 --> 40:02.537
Frost!

40:09.669 --> 40:11.463
Alberto...

40:11.546 --> 40:13.590
what you think?

40:18.303 --> 40:20.597
It doesn't reach
the inside.

40:20.639 --> 40:23.391
We can still
save them.

40:23.475 --> 40:25.560
We have a chance.
Now!

40:25.644 --> 40:27.062
<i>Sí, Don Alberto.</i>

40:27.145 --> 40:29.105
How can I help?

40:29.189 --> 40:30.982
Do you know
how to fly?

40:31.024 --> 40:32.400
If you'll show me.

40:32.484 --> 40:34.903
We are going to
lose everything,

40:34.986 --> 40:38.156
and you want me
to take time to show you?

40:39.658 --> 40:40.992
Look.

40:44.037 --> 40:45.246
Spread out.
Spread out!

40:49.668 --> 40:51.795
Like a butterfly.

40:56.716 --> 40:58.760
If you're going
to help,

40:58.843 --> 40:59.928
help!

41:01.137 --> 41:02.931
Butterfly.

41:04.349 --> 41:07.435
Get the heat down
on the grapes.

41:09.145 --> 41:10.814
Follow me.

41:12.607 --> 41:14.526
Up...

41:14.609 --> 41:16.820
down...

41:16.861 --> 41:18.947
up...

41:19.030 --> 41:20.156
down.

41:20.198 --> 41:21.533
That's it.

41:21.616 --> 41:23.993
Come on. With me.

42:58.463 --> 43:01.382
The bus doesn't leave
until 11 A.M..

43:01.466 --> 43:04.010
Then it's daylight.
Everyone will be up.

43:04.093 --> 43:05.511
It's better this way.

43:05.595 --> 43:07.597
Less questions.

43:09.641 --> 43:10.683
Yes.

43:13.603 --> 43:16.773
I wish you
the best of luck.

43:17.941 --> 43:19.484
You, too.

43:29.661 --> 43:31.496
<i>Buenos días, señor Paul.</i>

43:31.579 --> 43:35.041
It's the call of the grape that
robs our sleep.

43:35.124 --> 43:39.045
When she's ripe,
she calls to a man.

43:39.128 --> 43:40.546
Give me that.

43:40.630 --> 43:42.423
<i>Toma, Jose.</i>

43:43.633 --> 43:45.551
Walk with me.

43:45.635 --> 43:48.054
Bring the chocolates.

43:49.972 --> 43:51.140
Here.

43:52.517 --> 43:53.768
Here!

43:56.145 --> 43:57.105
Jose.

43:57.188 --> 43:58.523
<i>Buenos días,
don Pedro.</i>

43:58.606 --> 43:59.691
<i>Buenos días.</i>

44:03.569 --> 44:06.030
You know, everybody
gives you advice

44:06.114 --> 44:07.490
how to grow old.

44:07.532 --> 44:10.034
And the doctors,
they say,

44:10.118 --> 44:13.538
don Pedro,
no chocolates.

44:13.621 --> 44:17.041
Don Pedro, no salt

44:17.083 --> 44:20.044
and no cigars

44:20.086 --> 44:22.839
and little brandy
as possible.

44:22.880 --> 44:26.050
What the hell
do the doctors know

44:26.134 --> 44:29.053
about the needs...

44:29.137 --> 44:30.680
of a man's soul?

44:33.599 --> 44:35.059
<i>Nada!</i>

44:35.143 --> 44:37.061
Nothing.

44:41.190 --> 44:42.775
May I?

44:46.279 --> 44:48.781
Oh, this one.

44:51.617 --> 44:54.078
This looks like
my granddaughter's...

44:57.123 --> 44:59.041
I never
noticed that.

45:06.549 --> 45:08.050
<i>Excelente!</i>

45:09.760 --> 45:13.014
You know, in 1580,
the first Aragon, also a Pedro,

45:13.097 --> 45:15.057
came from Spain
to Mexico

45:15.099 --> 45:17.518
with a dream
in his head,

45:17.602 --> 45:19.520
the clothes
on his back,

45:19.604 --> 45:22.565
and the root
from the family's vineyard

45:22.607 --> 45:24.400
inside his pocket.

45:24.442 --> 45:25.693
Excuse me.

45:25.776 --> 45:27.612
May I... see one more?

45:28.613 --> 45:30.615
Which one?

45:34.619 --> 45:35.912
Ah, that's no good.

45:35.953 --> 45:37.455
Try one more.

45:41.918 --> 45:42.877
That's wonderful.

45:45.129 --> 45:46.547
Come...

45:46.631 --> 45:48.591
I will show you
something.

45:48.633 --> 45:51.552
This is the root
I brought with me,

45:51.636 --> 45:54.055
a descendant
from the root

45:54.138 --> 45:57.058
the first Pedro
brought with him.

45:57.141 --> 45:58.976
All our vines

45:59.060 --> 46:00.978
come from this one.

46:01.062 --> 46:06.025
It's not just
the root of Las Nubes.

46:06.108 --> 46:07.985
It's the root...

46:08.069 --> 46:10.488
of our lives,

46:10.571 --> 46:12.448
of Victoria's life.

46:12.490 --> 46:15.451
Now that you're
a part of all this,

46:15.493 --> 46:16.994
a part of us,

46:17.078 --> 46:21.165
it is the root
of your life.

46:24.210 --> 46:27.046
You are an orphan

46:27.129 --> 46:30.007
no longer.

46:34.178 --> 46:36.013
So...

46:36.097 --> 46:38.557
you will stay
with your family

46:38.641 --> 46:40.518
while we harvest
the fruit?

46:42.645 --> 46:44.522
It's a special time.

46:44.605 --> 46:47.149
It's a time of... magic.

46:50.111 --> 46:52.029
I really can't.

46:52.113 --> 46:54.156
I have commitments.

46:54.198 --> 46:57.535
What about the commitments
to your family?

46:57.618 --> 47:00.496
W-What can be
more important than that?

47:00.538 --> 47:03.207
I would like to,
really.

47:05.584 --> 47:07.920
But I can't.

47:11.590 --> 47:14.009
He said you...

47:14.051 --> 47:15.928
would not stay.

47:16.011 --> 47:17.388
Who did?

47:17.471 --> 47:19.056
Alberto.

47:19.140 --> 47:24.061
He said, "The first chance
the gringo gets,

47:24.103 --> 47:26.689
he will leave her."

47:30.109 --> 47:31.902
His exact words.

47:31.986 --> 47:33.696
I'm not leaving her.
I'm...

47:33.779 --> 47:36.532
No, no, no, no.
I understand.

47:36.615 --> 47:38.534
Just my...

47:38.576 --> 47:40.578
poor granddaughter.

47:40.619 --> 47:43.372
He will whip her
with it.

47:43.414 --> 47:48.544
She'll be the one
to pay for your commitments.

47:48.627 --> 47:50.546
Such a pity.

47:52.631 --> 47:56.093
Such a sweet girl.

47:56.135 --> 47:59.054
But it would
just be the difference of a day.

47:59.096 --> 48:01.557
The most important day
of our year,

48:01.599 --> 48:04.518
the day that makes
or breaks our fortunes...

48:04.602 --> 48:08.022
that's what he will
throw up to her...

48:08.105 --> 48:10.733
for the rest
of her life.

48:12.401 --> 48:14.361
I know...

48:14.445 --> 48:16.322
my son.

48:22.328 --> 48:23.787
Don Pedro.

48:25.831 --> 48:27.458
You're right.

48:29.126 --> 48:30.878
It's only one day.

48:30.961 --> 48:32.504
I'll stay.

48:39.136 --> 48:40.346
Right.

48:43.140 --> 48:44.975
May I?

48:50.648 --> 48:52.024
It's a good thing.

48:52.107 --> 48:55.736
You have no more
chocolates to sell, anyway.

49:07.081 --> 49:08.624
Come on.

49:25.766 --> 49:27.142
I thought you were
leaving.

49:27.184 --> 49:30.312
I thought it would be better for you
if I stuck around...

49:30.396 --> 49:31.814
at least until
the harvest.

49:31.855 --> 49:34.858
Don't you have
chocolates to sell?

49:36.110 --> 49:38.612
Family comes first.

49:43.742 --> 49:46.036
Hey, everybody,
I'm home!

49:47.496 --> 49:50.040
Hey, there.

49:51.959 --> 49:54.003
<i>¡Pedro! ¡Sí!</i>

49:56.630 --> 49:58.048
Hiya, sis.

49:58.090 --> 49:59.550
Hi, Jose.

49:59.591 --> 50:01.093
<i>Bienvenido.</i>

50:01.176 --> 50:03.387
Hi, Grandpa!

50:06.557 --> 50:08.350
Hi, Grandma.

50:10.102 --> 50:11.562
My favorite
chili's ready?

50:11.603 --> 50:13.564
<i>¡Claro que sí,
Pedrito!</i>

50:13.647 --> 50:15.566
<i>Saluda a su madre.</i>

50:15.649 --> 50:17.359
Hi, Mom.

50:17.401 --> 50:19.403
Oh, at last!

50:19.486 --> 50:21.613
Hi, Pop.

50:23.115 --> 50:24.575
Sorry I'm late.

50:24.658 --> 50:25.909
Pedro.

50:28.078 --> 50:30.456
This is my husband
Paul Sutton.

50:30.539 --> 50:32.416
Paul, my brother.

50:34.168 --> 50:36.044
You got hitched?

50:37.171 --> 50:38.881
Hey, that's swell!

50:38.922 --> 50:41.133
Oh!

50:43.177 --> 50:44.928
Victoria Sutton.

50:45.012 --> 50:47.181
I like that.

50:47.264 --> 50:49.600
Welcome to
the family.

50:49.641 --> 50:51.101
I'm Pete.

50:51.143 --> 50:52.102
Thanks.

50:52.144 --> 50:53.395
Pete.

50:54.688 --> 50:56.607
Who is Pete?

50:57.775 --> 50:59.067
Pa, come on.

50:59.109 --> 51:00.611
I don't know any Pete.

51:00.652 --> 51:03.739
I know I pay
a fortune in tuition

51:03.780 --> 51:07.201
to Stanford University
for a Pedro Alberto Aragon Limantour.

51:08.827 --> 51:10.537
Maybe I am paying
for the wrong person

51:10.621 --> 51:13.040
and I should
stop the check!

51:13.123 --> 51:15.209
Glad to meet you,
Pedro.

51:15.292 --> 51:17.336
Can we begin now?

51:17.419 --> 51:18.629
Victoria.

51:19.129 --> 51:21.632
Make sure he knows
what he's doing.

51:21.673 --> 51:24.635
We don't want him
cutting off his fingers

51:24.676 --> 51:26.553
and getting blood
on the grapes.

51:26.637 --> 51:29.223
It would ruin
the taste of the wine.

51:29.306 --> 51:30.724
<i>¡Que empiece la vendimia!</i>

51:30.807 --> 51:32.267
<i>¡Sí, señor!</i>

51:32.309 --> 51:34.937
Aren't you happy
you stayed?

53:04.109 --> 53:05.652
<i>No, gracias.</i>

53:59.456 --> 54:01.416
<i>¡Listo!</i>

54:16.389 --> 54:17.933
Papa.

54:22.229 --> 54:23.355
<i>Salud.</i>

54:33.448 --> 54:35.158
<i>¿Listos todos?</i>

54:38.662 --> 54:40.038
Come on.

54:40.121 --> 54:41.790
<i>¡Tiren las uvas!</i>

54:48.129 --> 54:49.548
How do they feel?

54:49.631 --> 54:51.550
They're
a little big.

54:51.633 --> 54:53.051
Clothes are
like family.

54:53.134 --> 54:56.096
You have to
live in them a while

54:56.179 --> 54:58.390
before you get
the perfect fit.

54:58.473 --> 55:00.350
But you are doing great.

55:00.433 --> 55:03.478
I don't know if everyone would
share your opinion.

55:03.562 --> 55:05.522
It's not easy
being in charge.

55:05.564 --> 55:08.525
It was not easy for me.
It's not easy for him.

55:08.567 --> 55:11.027
Every man has to
find his own way.

55:11.111 --> 55:13.154
But I have faith
in my son,

55:13.238 --> 55:17.033
and I have faith in you.

55:17.117 --> 55:19.286
But your fly
is open.

55:43.768 --> 55:46.021
My wife's family,
the Aztecs,

55:46.104 --> 55:47.564
have a belief

55:47.605 --> 55:50.025
that you have to
have the permission

55:50.066 --> 55:51.568
of the four winds

55:51.609 --> 55:54.571
to harvest
what the earth gives.

56:00.076 --> 56:01.870
Isn't she beautiful?

56:07.083 --> 56:09.169
<i>¡Las mujeres!</i>

56:13.089 --> 56:15.133
Victoria!

56:15.216 --> 56:18.470
Come on! You're a married
woman now.

56:18.553 --> 56:20.013
What about Pedro?

56:20.096 --> 56:21.765
He's not married.

56:21.848 --> 56:23.892
Neither are we.

59:41.464 --> 59:44.592
I want you more than anything,
Victoria.

59:44.675 --> 59:47.637
You can't imagine
how I want you.

59:47.678 --> 59:49.889
But I'm not free.

59:49.972 --> 59:54.185
And I won't
hurt you that way.

59:54.268 --> 59:56.479
I won't.

59:58.147 --> 59:59.816
I'm sorry.

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:02.819
I'm sorry.

01:00:54.453 --> 01:00:57.248
Pop, we can lead the market instead
of chase after it.

01:00:57.331 --> 01:00:59.000
Where the hell
is my hat?

01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:02.003
We can raise money
through limited partnerships.

01:01:02.044 --> 01:01:03.045
Hi, Paul.

01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:05.965
Hi, Pedro.
Morning, Mr. Aragon.

01:01:06.048 --> 01:01:08.134
So what do you
think, Pop?

01:01:08.217 --> 01:01:09.302
About what?

01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:11.679
Modernizing
the operation.

01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:13.222
The limited
partnerships.

01:01:13.264 --> 01:01:15.850
You take in a partner,
you take on trouble.

01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:18.519
You can always borrow
from the bank.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:24.358
Listen, just because
you harvested a few grapes

01:01:24.442 --> 01:01:26.444
doesn't give you
a say.

01:01:26.527 --> 01:01:27.945
Stick to your candy,

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.574
and keep your nose
out of our business.

01:01:31.657 --> 01:01:34.035
Now... tell me what's
going on here...

01:01:34.076 --> 01:01:36.787
that you sleep
one night on the floor,

01:01:36.871 --> 01:01:38.789
the next
on the couch.

01:01:38.873 --> 01:01:42.209
You'll use any excuse
to make him feel unwelcome,

01:01:42.293 --> 01:01:43.669
won't you?

01:01:43.753 --> 01:01:46.464
There is something
wrong here.

01:01:46.547 --> 01:01:49.008
This whole thing
smells wrong.

01:01:49.091 --> 01:01:50.509
A girl comes home

01:01:50.593 --> 01:01:54.013
with a husband
nobody ever heard of...

01:01:54.096 --> 01:01:57.725
with her suitcases
full as when she went away...

01:01:57.808 --> 01:02:00.686
like she has
no place else to go.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.188
Where's my hat?

01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:04.190
You don't want me
here?

01:02:05.232 --> 01:02:06.150
I'll leave.

01:02:06.233 --> 01:02:08.486
Is that
what you want?

01:02:09.403 --> 01:02:10.696
<i>I want the truth.</i>

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.073
That's what I want.

01:02:12.156 --> 01:02:13.574
No, you don't.

01:02:13.616 --> 01:02:17.244
The only truth you want is the truth
according to you.

01:02:17.328 --> 01:02:21.040
That's the only truth
you can accept.

01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:24.251
Try me.

01:02:38.307 --> 01:02:40.267
The truth is,
she came home

01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:42.061
because she loves
her family.

01:02:47.358 --> 01:02:48.818
I told you...

01:02:48.859 --> 01:02:51.987
stay out of
our business.

01:02:52.071 --> 01:02:54.949
<i>She is my business.</i>

01:02:56.492 --> 01:02:58.619
You were looking
for this?

01:03:20.891 --> 01:03:22.143
Señora!

01:03:23.561 --> 01:03:24.770
Señora.

01:03:27.231 --> 01:03:28.649
I appreciate it
very much,

01:03:28.732 --> 01:03:30.192
but I don't
have time.

01:03:30.276 --> 01:03:31.152
It smells.

01:03:31.235 --> 01:03:32.194
I know,

01:03:32.278 --> 01:03:33.696
but I have to leave.

01:03:33.779 --> 01:03:34.989
I have business.

01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:38.534
Don Pedro has
finished your business, I think, no?

01:03:38.617 --> 01:03:41.996
And besides, you
must see it through.

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:43.539
See what through?

01:03:43.622 --> 01:03:44.832
Your fate...

01:03:44.915 --> 01:03:47.626
what brought
you here.

01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:49.295
Nothing
brought me here.

01:03:49.378 --> 01:03:51.171
<i>I brought me here.</i>

01:04:06.729 --> 01:04:07.730
What's wrong?

01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:08.689
Nothing.

01:04:08.772 --> 01:04:10.691
Here, let me
help you inside.

01:04:10.774 --> 01:04:12.318
No. We had a plan.

01:04:12.401 --> 01:04:14.862
You were going to
stay for one night

01:04:14.904 --> 01:04:16.864
and go back
to your wife.

01:04:16.906 --> 01:04:18.866
We should stick
to the plan.

01:04:18.908 --> 01:04:20.868
I can't leave you
like this.

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.871
And tomorrow? Will you stay
tomorrow, too?

01:04:23.913 --> 01:04:26.123
And the day
after that?

01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:29.168
Go home, Paul.

01:04:30.085 --> 01:04:31.837
You still
have a wife.

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:34.715
Leave it
at the station.

01:04:34.757 --> 01:04:35.841
Victoria, please...

01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:38.344
You can't help me
anymore, Paul!

01:04:40.262 --> 01:04:42.014
No one can help me.

01:04:43.265 --> 01:04:44.933
It's not
your problem.

01:04:51.565 --> 01:04:53.233
It's not my problem.

01:04:56.737 --> 01:04:58.155
I can't leave.

01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.912
Victoria!

01:05:08.374 --> 01:05:09.500
Victoria?

01:05:12.044 --> 01:05:13.295
Victoria!

01:05:15.964 --> 01:05:19.802
Don't think that just because
you married her

01:05:19.885 --> 01:05:21.804
any of this
is yours...

01:05:21.887 --> 01:05:24.139
if you married her
at all.

01:05:24.223 --> 01:05:26.558
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:05:26.642 --> 01:05:28.060
I wasn't there.

01:05:28.143 --> 01:05:30.062
I didn't see a wedding.

01:05:30.145 --> 01:05:32.940
I didn't even see
a wedding certificate.

01:05:36.735 --> 01:05:38.153
And don't think

01:05:38.237 --> 01:05:40.614
that just because
I speak with an accent

01:05:40.697 --> 01:05:43.784
<i>I think
with an accent.</i>

01:05:43.867 --> 01:05:46.203
For four years
that I've been at war,

01:05:46.286 --> 01:05:48.705
to do what I had to do,

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:51.125
I had to keep myself
closed off.

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:53.085
What's your reason?

01:05:53.168 --> 01:05:55.629
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:05:55.671 --> 01:05:57.297
Reason for what?

01:05:57.381 --> 01:05:59.800
For shutting your daughter
out of your heart.

01:05:59.842 --> 01:06:02.136
Can't you see
how amazing she is?

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:03.470
How alive?

01:06:03.554 --> 01:06:06.890
My whole life, I've dreamed of getting
the kind of love

01:06:06.974 --> 01:06:08.934
your daughter
tries to give you.

01:06:09.017 --> 01:06:11.728
I would die
for what you have.

01:06:14.857 --> 01:06:16.859
Why can't you
just love her?

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:19.319
She's so easy to love.

01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:21.822
You know nothing
about my daughter!

01:06:21.864 --> 01:06:23.323
You hear me?

01:06:23.365 --> 01:06:24.366
Nothing!

01:06:24.408 --> 01:06:27.494
I know that she is
good... and strong...

01:06:27.578 --> 01:06:30.539
and deserves all the love
this world has to give.

01:06:30.581 --> 01:06:32.166
Can't you see that?

01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:34.293
How wonderful...

01:06:34.376 --> 01:06:36.837
how special she is?

01:06:36.879 --> 01:06:39.173
You see this?

01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:40.507
This land...

01:06:40.591 --> 01:06:42.217
this vineyard!

01:06:43.218 --> 01:06:47.681
This is 365 days
a year.

01:06:47.764 --> 01:06:50.893
Who do you think
I do this for?

01:06:50.976 --> 01:06:52.603
For them!

01:06:52.686 --> 01:06:56.231
All of them!
I love my family!

01:06:56.315 --> 01:06:58.901
You should let them
know it.

01:07:26.428 --> 01:07:28.513
Paul. Hey, Paul.

01:07:28.597 --> 01:07:29.932
Hey.

01:07:30.015 --> 01:07:31.642
Brandy.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.645
The finest.

01:07:34.728 --> 01:07:37.856
I made it
myself.

01:07:38.899 --> 01:07:41.151
21 years ago.

01:07:41.234 --> 01:07:43.320
The secret
about brandy...

01:07:43.403 --> 01:07:45.530
is age.

01:07:45.614 --> 01:07:46.949
The secret

01:07:47.032 --> 01:07:49.117
of everything...

01:07:50.661 --> 01:07:52.079
is age.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.121
<i>Hija...</i>

01:07:53.205 --> 01:07:55.082
Are you all right?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.627
He only
went to work.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.379
He will come back.

01:08:09.429 --> 01:08:11.431
What the hell
is that?

01:08:11.515 --> 01:08:13.100
My uniform.

01:08:13.183 --> 01:08:14.643
Ah.

01:08:14.726 --> 01:08:15.644
Of course.

01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:18.104
Newlyweds.

01:08:18.188 --> 01:08:20.107
What else
do they do

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:22.274
but make love
and war?

01:08:26.613 --> 01:08:28.490
Did you talk to her?

01:08:28.573 --> 01:08:29.658
I tried.

01:08:29.741 --> 01:08:31.618
Wouldn't make
a difference.

01:08:31.702 --> 01:08:33.620
Talking between
men and women

01:08:33.703 --> 01:08:36.288
never solves
anything.

01:08:36.372 --> 01:08:38.166
Where we think...

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:40.252
they feel.

01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:43.462
They are creatures...

01:08:43.546 --> 01:08:45.590
of the heart.

01:08:46.675 --> 01:08:47.926
Please.

01:08:48.009 --> 01:08:49.136
Sit down.

01:08:49.219 --> 01:08:50.136
Don Pedro...

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.139
No, no, no.
Please. Come on.

01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:54.474
- Come on. Give me that.
- Don Pedro...

01:08:54.515 --> 01:08:55.517
No, no.

01:08:55.559 --> 01:08:57.102
I'll miss my bus
again.

01:08:57.185 --> 01:08:58.895
You make yourself
comfortable.

01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:01.898
Please. Tomorrow we will
go to the festival

01:09:01.982 --> 01:09:04.984
for the wine blessing.
The bus will be there.

01:09:05.068 --> 01:09:07.487
I have

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:10.448
the perfect solution
for you.

01:09:12.868 --> 01:09:14.077
Here.

01:09:17.872 --> 01:09:18.915
<i>Salud.</i>

01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:21.835
<i>Salud.</i>

01:10:00.207 --> 01:10:01.374
Thank you.

01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:04.377
Isn't that the most
romantic thing you ever heard?

01:10:04.419 --> 01:10:07.380
Maybe it loses
a little bit on translation.

01:10:07.422 --> 01:10:09.382
No, no,
no, no, no.

01:10:09.424 --> 01:10:10.884
All right, now.

01:10:10.926 --> 01:10:12.802
<i>Muchachos...
Otra vez.</i>

01:10:12.886 --> 01:10:14.804
<i>Esta vez el va
cantar. Vamos.</i>

01:10:15.847 --> 01:10:17.432
Now you sing.

01:10:25.649 --> 01:10:28.276
That's all right,
that's all right, that's all right.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.946
It's all right.
You did wonderful.

01:10:31.029 --> 01:10:33.490
Let's let the experts
do it themselves.

01:10:58.723 --> 01:11:00.642
You're a gringo.

01:11:00.725 --> 01:11:02.644
Nice, but still
a gringo.

01:11:02.727 --> 01:11:05.605
The heart you
are talking to is Mexican.

01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:10.193
You speak to it in the language
it understands.

01:11:10.276 --> 01:11:11.319
You...

01:11:14.447 --> 01:11:15.365
You...

01:11:15.448 --> 01:11:16.825
be strong.

01:11:16.908 --> 01:11:18.993
Ah. Stand
right here.

01:11:19.911 --> 01:11:20.995
Right here.

01:11:24.124 --> 01:11:25.041
All right.

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:26.459
<i>Salud.</i>

01:11:28.378 --> 01:11:29.504
Mmm.

01:11:29.587 --> 01:11:32.340
No, no, no.
You've had enough.

01:11:33.299 --> 01:11:34.175
All right.

01:11:34.259 --> 01:11:35.176
You boys...

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.886
wait for my signal.

01:11:54.696 --> 01:11:56.322
<i>¿A usted quién
ha invito?</i>

01:11:56.406 --> 01:11:57.365
<i>Ay, señor.</i>

01:11:57.449 --> 01:11:58.491
<i>¡Sáquese de aquí!</i>

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:16.634
Alberto.

01:12:18.261 --> 01:12:19.679
Alberto.

01:12:19.721 --> 01:12:20.847
Listen.

01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.054
You keep watching
the window.

01:13:01.137 --> 01:13:03.181
When the light
comes on,

01:13:03.264 --> 01:13:05.516
you are saved.

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.645
Just watch
the window.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.198
He seems to love her.

01:13:21.407 --> 01:13:23.201
Mm-hmm.

01:13:23.284 --> 01:13:24.327
Maybe I...

01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:26.829
I've been too tough
on him.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.810
What's the matter?

01:14:08.538 --> 01:14:09.497
Paul.

01:14:46.868 --> 01:14:48.661
Now that you're
single, Paul,

01:14:48.703 --> 01:14:51.330
don't start having
too much fun at the festival.

01:14:51.414 --> 01:14:53.332
Our bus leaves
in 10 minutes.

01:15:17.023 --> 01:15:17.899
The Aragons!

01:15:17.982 --> 01:15:18.900
Oh!
Aah!

01:15:18.983 --> 01:15:20.318
The Aragons are coming!

01:15:20.401 --> 01:15:21.486
Look!

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.263
Hello.
How are you?

01:15:50.932 --> 01:15:52.767
Marie Jose.

01:15:56.687 --> 01:15:59.899
I will now recite
the blessing of the harvest.

01:15:59.941 --> 01:16:01.901
We thank you,
Lord in heaven,

01:16:01.943 --> 01:16:05.029
for bestowing on us
the bounty of thy harvest.

01:16:05.112 --> 01:16:07.573
We ask only
that each life here

01:16:07.657 --> 01:16:10.576
be blessed with the full
measure of love,

01:16:10.618 --> 01:16:12.286
health, and happiness

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:14.789
that those who
acknowledge God in heaven

01:16:14.872 --> 01:16:15.957
justly deserve.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:16.916
Amen.

01:16:16.999 --> 01:16:19.043
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:16:34.642 --> 01:16:35.518
Excellent!

01:16:43.734 --> 01:16:44.819
Victoria.

01:16:56.163 --> 01:16:58.624
Your serenade
was very beautiful.

01:17:01.043 --> 01:17:02.962
Will you toast
with me?

01:17:07.883 --> 01:17:09.593
What do we toast to?

01:17:10.511 --> 01:17:13.305
To... what if.

01:17:15.182 --> 01:17:16.767
To what if.

01:17:21.731 --> 01:17:23.149
Father Phillipo...

01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:25.151
may I introduce
Paul Sutton...

01:17:25.234 --> 01:17:26.819
my new son-in-law?

01:17:26.902 --> 01:17:30.489
As you can see,
a bona fide war hero.

01:17:30.573 --> 01:17:32.992
He helped bring in
the harvest.

01:17:33.034 --> 01:17:33.993
Papa...

01:17:34.035 --> 01:17:36.162
What? I can't be proud?

01:17:36.245 --> 01:17:39.248
This is a blessed surprise.
Congratulations, Victoria!

01:17:39.331 --> 01:17:40.249
Thank you.

01:17:40.332 --> 01:17:42.293
I gave her
first communion.

01:17:42.334 --> 01:17:44.462
Always thought I'd
give her in marriage.

01:17:44.545 --> 01:17:46.464
And you shall.

01:17:46.547 --> 01:17:48.924
City Hall is not
a proper place

01:17:49.008 --> 01:17:50.593
to take your
wedding vows.

01:17:50.676 --> 01:17:53.304
Not for my own
daughter.

01:17:53.345 --> 01:17:54.263
Tonight...

01:17:54.346 --> 01:17:55.806
Listen to me!

01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:57.308
Tonight...

01:17:57.349 --> 01:17:59.810
I give my daughter's
hand in marriage

01:17:59.894 --> 01:18:02.646
before the eyes
of God.

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:06.776
And I will take it
as a personal insult

01:18:06.859 --> 01:18:09.278
if you all
do not show up.

01:18:10.362 --> 01:18:11.614
You are
all invited!

01:18:11.697 --> 01:18:13.282
Why are you
doing this?

01:18:13.365 --> 01:18:15.951
A man can change
his mind, can't he?

01:18:19.038 --> 01:18:20.539
We have to tell them.

01:18:20.623 --> 01:18:24.168
<i>No. I have
to tell them.</i>

01:18:24.251 --> 01:18:26.045
I'm not scared now.

01:18:27.963 --> 01:18:29.048
Here.

01:18:34.053 --> 01:18:35.971
For the baby.

01:18:37.056 --> 01:18:38.891
A little present.

01:18:39.892 --> 01:18:42.228
What did you
get it for?

01:18:42.311 --> 01:18:43.896
Courage under fire.

01:18:46.857 --> 01:18:48.901
Paul Sutton...

01:18:48.984 --> 01:18:53.030
you're the most honorable man
I have ever known.

01:20:16.196 --> 01:20:17.698
Where you headed,
soldier?

01:20:17.781 --> 01:20:19.158
San Francisco.

01:20:19.241 --> 01:20:22.828
I can get you as far as
San Rafael. Climb in.

01:20:23.746 --> 01:20:24.830
Thanks.

01:20:28.208 --> 01:20:30.836
What you doing
around these parts?

01:20:30.878 --> 01:20:32.338
Walking.

01:20:32.379 --> 01:20:33.839
Walking.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.508
In the clouds.

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:37.968
Ha ha ha ha.

01:20:38.052 --> 01:20:40.012
Well, welcome
back to Earth.

01:22:50.183 --> 01:22:52.144
Who's there?

01:22:52.227 --> 01:22:53.270
It's me.

01:23:01.236 --> 01:23:02.654
You read them.

01:23:02.738 --> 01:23:04.156
Yes, Paul, I...

01:23:04.197 --> 01:23:05.449
Betty?

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.285
Paul. Paul,
listen to me.

01:23:08.368 --> 01:23:10.954
It wasn't going to work...
for either of us.

01:23:11.038 --> 01:23:13.498
If I'd only read
those letters sooner.

01:23:13.582 --> 01:23:15.500
We hardly even
knew each other.

01:23:15.542 --> 01:23:17.502
We want different things,
different lives.

01:23:17.544 --> 01:23:19.504
Who is it, Betty?

01:23:19.588 --> 01:23:21.631
I don't even
like dogs!

01:23:23.717 --> 01:23:26.678
It's not what
it appears to be.

01:23:26.762 --> 01:23:28.305
Armistead?

01:23:28.388 --> 01:23:29.973
Paul,
listen to me.

01:23:30.057 --> 01:23:32.017
What we want
is so opposite.

01:23:32.059 --> 01:23:33.310
It would've
never worked.

01:23:33.393 --> 01:23:34.644
I would've
been miserable.

01:23:34.728 --> 01:23:37.689
I came all the way back.
I was ready to try.

01:23:37.731 --> 01:23:39.316
Paul, don't do
anything crazy.

01:23:39.358 --> 01:23:42.694
I'll just get my things and...
Don't hit me.

01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:45.614
I'm not going
to hit you.

01:23:51.036 --> 01:23:52.204
Betty...

01:23:53.372 --> 01:23:55.499
We could still
be friends.

01:23:56.541 --> 01:23:57.667
Friends?

01:24:00.212 --> 01:24:02.798
I thought an annulment
would be the easiest.

01:24:10.388 --> 01:24:12.641
You just have to...
sign it.

01:24:19.397 --> 01:24:21.650
I'm sorry, Paul.

01:24:36.915 --> 01:24:38.041
Paul!

01:24:38.125 --> 01:24:40.210
Are you all right?

01:24:42.087 --> 01:24:43.380
Yeah!

01:24:44.756 --> 01:24:45.632
I'm fine!

01:25:35.223 --> 01:25:36.349
Thanks.

01:26:00.498 --> 01:26:01.833
Mr. Aragon?

01:26:07.839 --> 01:26:09.174
Mr. Aragon.

01:26:17.682 --> 01:26:19.976
I owe you
an apology, sir.

01:26:20.018 --> 01:26:22.354
What I did was wrong.

01:26:22.395 --> 01:26:24.230
Get off my land.

01:26:24.314 --> 01:26:27.567
My intentions were good.
I wanted to protect her.

01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:29.444
Stay away from her.

01:26:29.527 --> 01:26:30.403
I can't.

01:26:30.487 --> 01:26:33.031
She's like the air to me.

01:26:33.114 --> 01:26:36.451
I've come to ask you
for her hand in marriage.

01:26:36.534 --> 01:26:38.661
You are already married,

01:26:38.703 --> 01:26:40.663
you son of a bitch!

01:26:40.705 --> 01:26:42.207
Jose!

01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:43.249
My gun!

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:44.250
But, Alberto...

01:26:44.334 --> 01:26:45.794
My gun! Now!

01:26:45.877 --> 01:26:48.338
My marriage was
never meant to be.

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.840
It was the war.
It was a mistake.

01:26:50.882 --> 01:26:52.801
But it's over...
annulled. Look.

01:26:52.884 --> 01:26:55.053
You deceived me...

01:26:55.136 --> 01:26:56.805
in my own house...

01:26:56.888 --> 01:26:58.598
in my own bed!

01:26:58.681 --> 01:27:00.100
Stay away from her!

01:27:00.183 --> 01:27:01.601
I love her.

01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:05.146
I want to be with her
for the rest of my life,

01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:06.606
to take care of her!

01:27:06.689 --> 01:27:08.108
Jose! My gun!

01:27:08.191 --> 01:27:09.359
Victoria!

01:27:09.401 --> 01:27:10.360
My gun!

01:27:10.402 --> 01:27:11.361
Victoria!

01:27:11.403 --> 01:27:13.071
Paul.

01:27:13.154 --> 01:27:17.075
You made me the fool
in front of the world!

01:27:17.158 --> 01:27:20.578
It's not even your child
she carries!

01:27:20.662 --> 01:27:23.289
It will be
if she'll have me.

01:27:23.373 --> 01:27:26.793
I... I'll see you
dead first!

01:27:26.876 --> 01:27:28.628
Señorita!
Paul!

01:27:28.711 --> 01:27:29.879
Victoria!

01:27:29.963 --> 01:27:31.089
Paul!

01:27:32.048 --> 01:27:32.966
Pedro!

01:27:34.592 --> 01:27:35.718
Victoria!

01:27:35.802 --> 01:27:37.053
Stop!

01:27:37.137 --> 01:27:38.138
Stop!

01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:39.889
I love him!

01:27:39.931 --> 01:27:41.558
I love him!

01:27:41.599 --> 01:27:42.767
No!

01:27:47.897 --> 01:27:49.899
Oh, my God.

01:27:57.699 --> 01:27:58.783
Papa.

01:28:01.786 --> 01:28:03.746
What... What
have I done?

01:28:24.183 --> 01:28:25.852
Please.

01:28:25.935 --> 01:28:27.437
No!

01:29:06.351 --> 01:29:08.144
Don Pedro!

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.815
Let me go!

01:29:13.858 --> 01:29:15.234
Get away!

01:29:15.318 --> 01:29:17.070
I want to stay!

01:29:17.153 --> 01:29:18.655
Get... Get away!

01:29:20.323 --> 01:29:21.282
Pop! Pop!

01:29:21.366 --> 01:29:23.326
Pedro!

01:29:23.368 --> 01:29:26.746
Lie down, Pedro!
Don't run!

01:29:26.829 --> 01:29:29.040
Lie down!

01:29:29.123 --> 01:29:30.249
Pedro!

01:29:43.471 --> 01:29:45.390
I'm all right!

01:31:00.798 --> 01:31:01.924
Papa.

01:31:06.053 --> 01:31:08.014
I was afraid.

01:31:12.268 --> 01:31:14.812
I was afraid
of losing you.

01:31:19.233 --> 01:31:20.818
All of you.

01:31:26.908 --> 01:31:30.453
I didn't know
any other way to love.

01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:38.336
Can you teach me?

01:31:40.755 --> 01:31:42.131
Please...

01:31:42.173 --> 01:31:44.634
can you teach me?

01:32:07.907 --> 01:32:09.992
The fire burned through...

01:32:10.034 --> 01:32:11.494
everything.

01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:17.792
There's no root stock
left to... to replant.

01:32:21.379 --> 01:32:23.255
Las Nubes...

01:32:26.258 --> 01:32:27.718
is finished.

01:34:26.003 --> 01:34:27.963
Has it reached
the inside?

01:34:45.397 --> 01:34:46.440
It's alive.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.986
It's alive!

01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:54.031
Las Nubes lives!

01:34:55.115 --> 01:34:57.618
We can plant!

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.167
This...

01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:07.628
is the root...

01:35:07.711 --> 01:35:09.421
of your life...

01:35:11.882 --> 01:35:13.467
the root...

01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:15.302
of your family.

01:35:17.221 --> 01:35:20.057
You are bound
to this land...

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.725
and to this family...

01:35:22.893 --> 01:35:24.895
by commitment...

01:35:24.979 --> 01:35:26.188
by honor...

01:35:27.606 --> 01:35:29.525
and by love.

01:35:31.694 --> 01:35:33.028
Plant it.

01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:35.531
It will grow.

01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:41.495
I don't know how.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.460
Victoria.

01:35:48.544 --> 01:35:50.129
Help your husband.

01:36:36.884 --> 01:36:39.178
Beautiful.
