GREG:
<i>So, why couldn't we just have</i>

00:09.417 --> 00:11.083
dinner with your boss
at a nice restaurant?

00:11.166 --> 00:12.959
Because I'm trying
to make partner, Greg.

00:13.041 --> 00:14.458
I need him to see the real me.

00:14.542 --> 00:17.458
Then why did we put away
all the photos of Lark?

00:17.542 --> 00:19.000
Oh, he doesn't know
I have a kid.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.250
Also, he thinks we're vegan,

00:20.333 --> 00:21.917
so the food's gonna suck--
sorry.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.375
(doorbell rings)

00:24.458 --> 00:25.625
(laughing):
I mean, come on.

00:25.709 --> 00:27.750
That is, like, legit crazy.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.625
I cannot believe you went
to Camp Running Wolf, too.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.792
Now, is this the camp
where the kid got murdered,

00:31.875 --> 00:33.083
or the one
with the cool hot dogs?

00:33.166 --> 00:35.125
Same camp. Hey, Paul.

00:35.208 --> 00:37.709
Hey, Paul, do you like
mashed potatoes?

00:37.792 --> 00:39.417
Oh, we don't have any
mashed potatoes, hon.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.959
JEN AND PAUL:
Hot potato, hot potato,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.250
we'll be friends forever.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.250
Hot potato, hot potato,
we'll be friends for life.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.750
Mush it, dash it,
mix it, mash it.

00:46.834 --> 00:48.875
Never use a knife.

00:48.959 --> 00:51.458
Okay, if you can lay down
some lyrics,

00:51.542 --> 00:53.166
I can beatbox.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.208
And that's when I realized

00:55.291 --> 00:57.208
somebody has to rescue

00:57.291 --> 00:58.500
the teacup poodles.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.041
-Oh, absolutely.
-Yeah.

01:00.125 --> 01:01.458
-Of course, yeah.
-Absolutely.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.625
How many poodles
have you rescued?

01:03.709 --> 01:06.750
Three. We're very picky.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.000
Mm-hmm. I love
a discerning charity.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.625
Yeah, do you take donations?

01:10.709 --> 01:12.875
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:12.959 --> 01:13.917
Great.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.208
I'm gonna get my checkbook.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.709
Who should I make
the check out to?

01:16.792 --> 01:18.250
Well, the foundation's
in my name,

01:18.333 --> 01:20.000
so just make it out to me.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.500
Done.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.542
I can't remember
Paul's wife's name.

01:26.625 --> 01:28.792
Oh, you should have used
the rhyming trick, Jen-Pen.

01:28.875 --> 01:30.542
Did you do the rhyming trick?

01:30.625 --> 01:32.333
Not for her,
but I did for Tall Paul

01:32.417 --> 01:34.458
-who buys a ball in a stall.
-Okay.

01:34.542 --> 01:35.500
Here, don't worry,
I got you.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.208
Hey, uh, how do I spell
your name?

01:37.291 --> 01:38.709
Just the way it sounds.

01:38.792 --> 01:41.750
Got it. Then that is how
we are gonna spell it.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.291
Yeah, if you don't do
the rhyming trick

01:43.375 --> 01:44.667
out of the gate,
you're kinda screwed.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.000
Okay. We're still looking
for that checkbook.

01:47.083 --> 01:48.500
Oh, we found it.

01:48.583 --> 01:51.000
Greg, do you not know
what we're doing in here?

01:51.083 --> 01:52.417
I honestly don't.

01:53.834 --> 01:55.583
Are you serious?
None of the other assistants

01:55.667 --> 01:57.333
know Paul's wife's name?

01:57.417 --> 01:59.667
Yeah, of course I know
the other assistants' names.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.834
Yeah, of course
I know your name.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.709
Not today, okay?
Please don't test me.

02:03.792 --> 02:06.667
Yeah, no. We're done here.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.166
You can get back to the funeral.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.875
You want to know what
I've been getting into?

02:09.959 --> 02:11.375
-Genealogy.
-Yeah.

02:11.458 --> 02:12.583
-Mm.
-Did you know

02:12.667 --> 02:14.917
that I'm named after
my great uncle?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.625
But, medically, great aunt.

02:17.709 --> 02:18.917
Yeah, it's kind of like

02:19.000 --> 02:20.542
that movie, <i>Mrs. Doubtfire--</i>
you've seen it.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.792
Except her name was Greg.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.875
You know, I've never seen
<i>Mrs. Doubtfire.</i>

02:24.959 --> 02:26.125
What?

02:26.208 --> 02:28.083
So, are you named after anybody?

02:28.166 --> 02:29.875
Well, you know,
there was this garden

02:29.959 --> 02:31.208
in the home that I grew up in,

02:31.291 --> 02:33.750
so, obviously...

02:33.834 --> 02:36.125
-Pfft, yeah, obviously.
-Obviously.

02:36.208 --> 02:37.458
(laughs)

02:37.542 --> 02:39.458
Ding. Sounds like
the coffee's ready.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.917
-Greg, will you meet me in the kitchen?
-Uh-huh.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.792
Her name is related to a garden.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.166
-Okay,
I'm just gonna throw some out there.
-Okay.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.500
-You tell me if any one lands.
-Yeah.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.000
-Okay, Lily.
-Good.

02:48.083 --> 02:49.041
-Myrtle.
-Yep.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.083
-Fern.
-Maybe.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.208
-Fence.
-No. Yeah, that's a hard pass.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.417
Fence Saltarelli?

02:53.500 --> 02:55.750
I mean,
this is a disaster, Greg.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.667
Like, if she finds out
that we don't know her name

02:57.750 --> 02:59.375
after spending
an entire evening together,

02:59.458 --> 03:00.709
she's gonna hate us.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.417
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.917
Probably more you, but mm-hmm.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.834
PAUL:
Do I have something in my nose, Bunny?

03:08.917 --> 03:12.125
No. All good. Clear.

03:12.208 --> 03:13.792
Bunny. Her name is Bunny.

03:13.875 --> 03:16.125
<i>Bunny </i>in the garden.
I am very mad

03:16.208 --> 03:17.709
that I did not
come up with that.

03:17.792 --> 03:21.458
Okay, who's ready for coffee?

03:21.542 --> 03:23.542
Bunny, you a regular
or decaf girl?

03:23.625 --> 03:26.750
Uh, regular, I guess.

03:26.834 --> 03:28.417
You sure? 'Cause I can
whip up a pot of decaf

03:28.500 --> 03:29.458
like that, Bunny.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.125
(chuckles) Okay.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.333
Excuse me, I forgot the sugar.

03:35.417 --> 03:36.750
Crap, I got it wrong.

03:36.834 --> 03:37.875
You should have seen
the look he gave her.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.875
I mean, I clearly called her
the wrong name.

03:39.959 --> 03:40.917
This is terrible.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.333
I knew she wasn't a Bunny.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.667
I mean, I didn't want to
say anything, but I knew it.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.542
I just screwed myself
out of making partner

03:46.625 --> 03:48.583
because I couldn't remember
one name.

03:48.667 --> 03:49.709
Now I'm gonna have
to keep parking

03:49.792 --> 03:51.583
between assistant
what's-her-face

03:51.667 --> 03:54.125
and Mrs. Never Flushes.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.792
You know, it's actually
getting a little late.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.625
We're gonna take a pass
on the coffee.

03:58.709 --> 04:01.125
Oh, no, no, stay.
Just-just one cup.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.417
We've got cream, sugar, agave.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.667
You know what I say?
I like it,

04:04.750 --> 04:06.125
I love it,
<i>agave </i>have it.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.208
-Huh?
-We don't have any agave.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.041
Well, damn it, Bunny!

04:14.125 --> 04:15.375
You should have
told me that earlier.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.750
(scoffs) I mean,

04:16.834 --> 04:19.709
Is he a funny bunny or what?
(laughs)

04:19.792 --> 04:22.125
-You call your husband "Bunny"?
-Mm-hmm.

04:22.208 --> 04:25.458
'Cause we were wondering why
you were calling her Bunny.

04:25.542 --> 04:28.000
-Yeah.
-That's my pet name for Rose.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.667
No way. Yeah,
I just call everybody Bunny.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.250
(laughs)

04:32.333 --> 04:33.834
(quietly):
Rose blows her nose
and never shows her toes.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.333
Got it. (clears throat)

04:35.417 --> 04:38.291
-So, you bunnies want to stay for coffee?
-Hmm?

04:38.375 --> 04:40.583
-What the heck, what's one cup?
-Yes.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.250
-Great.
-Great, great. Hey, say, do you, uh...

04:42.333 --> 04:44.792
you have any camp songs
about drinking coffee?

04:44.875 --> 04:46.208
We were children at camp.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.458
We didn't drink coffee.

04:47.542 --> 04:49.917
Yeah. But we did drink
bug juice!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.625
-Oh! Bug juice!
-(laughs)

04:51.709 --> 04:55.333
So, did you go
to sleepaway camp, Peter?

04:55.417 --> 04:57.166
-Uh...
-Uh...

04:57.250 --> 05:01.500
Yeah, Peter, uh, went
to break-dancing camp.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.291
Oh. Oh, you just getting home?

05:12.375 --> 05:15.500
I was just, uh, checking the
expiration date on the mustard.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.291
Still got two months,
but that'll sneak up on us.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.291
I'm sorry that I didn't text you
back last night.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.333
-Oh.
-I lost my phone

05:21.417 --> 05:23.291
in the dugout at Dodger Stadium.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.041
Crazy night.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.834
It turns out the players
are super nice, by the way.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.667
Yeah. They seem really nice
on TV.

05:29.750 --> 05:30.709
Yeah.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.166
Hey, uh, next time,

05:33.250 --> 05:34.583
maybe we could just have
a signal

05:34.667 --> 05:36.041
so that I know you're okay.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.250
That signal could be
that you text me back.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.333
Totally.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.291
Hey, when you first said

05:41.375 --> 05:43.208
that we should break up, I...

05:43.291 --> 05:47.458
wasn't so sure, but I am
learning so much about myself.

05:47.542 --> 05:50.125
Like, it turns out
I'm super funny!

05:50.208 --> 05:52.041
Guys laugh at everything I say,

05:52.125 --> 05:53.834
even when I don't understand
the joke.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.625
-(chuckles)
-See? (giggles)

05:55.709 --> 05:56.875
Look at me.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.375
Yeah. Look at you.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.291
Where's Clementine, anyway?

06:04.375 --> 06:07.417
The Dodgers have an away game,
and, evidently, she's good luck.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.417
Oh, yeah, that's the dream.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.417
To be a young, nubile woman.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.959
And so funny!

06:13.041 --> 06:14.166
-(chuckling): Right?
-Yeah.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.417
She's... (chuckles)

06:15.500 --> 06:16.834
But what you got's not bad.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.458
You got to get out there
and let the ladies know

06:18.542 --> 06:19.792
you're down to clown.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.709
I'm respecting the honeymoon
period of our divorce.

06:22.792 --> 06:24.959
I think Clementine and I
should take some time

06:25.041 --> 06:26.709
and examine our feelings.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.709
Oh, feelings are what got you
in this mess in the first place.

06:29.792 --> 06:33.208
Marriage, responsibilities,
that stupid house.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.792
Man, get out there
and have some fun.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.458
No strings attached.

06:36.542 --> 06:37.792
I don't know if I'm ready.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.667
You listen to me.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
You take it from a man
who also got married too soon.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.667
You never get these years
of freedom back.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.750
Now, I love your mother.

06:45.834 --> 06:47.000
-(chuckles) You know?
-Uh-huh.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.959
Very happy with the choices
I've made, but...

06:50.041 --> 06:51.959
if I had a chance
to do it all over again,

06:52.041 --> 06:53.208
I'd do it a little different.

06:53.291 --> 06:54.959
And I'd do a lot more of it.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.041
You know?

06:56.125 --> 06:57.083
Again, love your mom.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.333
Very happy.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.333
But you got to get out there.

07:00.417 --> 07:03.000
You got to live life
for both of us.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.667
(both moaning)

07:08.750 --> 07:10.041
(objects clattering)

07:10.125 --> 07:11.917
Oh, I am so glad we matched.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.667
I thought an app for divorcees

07:13.750 --> 07:16.166
was gonna be filled with
a bunch of lonely losers.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.291
God, it is just so fascinating
to meet someone

07:19.375 --> 07:21.667
who's this naturally smooth.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.041
Oh, thank you. (chuckles)

07:23.125 --> 07:25.166
I love that we have
so much in common:

07:25.250 --> 07:27.542
still living with our exes,
just got on the market,

07:27.625 --> 07:29.417
not looking
for anything serious.

07:29.500 --> 07:33.500
Yes! Let's just go crazy
and have fun, you know?

07:33.583 --> 07:35.250
We all have HPV anyway.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.291
-We do?
-Oh, yeah.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.500
So, you're so smooth.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.083
Okay.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.834
(gasps) Two mugs.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.542
-(laughs)
-We did it! We did it!

07:46.625 --> 07:47.959
Oh, wait, did we do it,
or are we just telling people

07:48.041 --> 07:49.083
we did?
Doesn't matter to me.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.792
-No. We did it.
-Yes!

07:50.875 --> 07:53.625
-This is for Alex.
-Alex! Oh, buddy.

07:53.709 --> 07:55.166
Oh!

07:55.250 --> 07:56.792
-Ah, she sounds hot.
-Yeah.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.625
I mean... "she," right?

07:58.709 --> 08:00.166
Not that it matters.
Doesn't matter.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.750
Just want you to have fun,

08:01.834 --> 08:03.917
'cause this is the life

-Oh, thank you for that.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.834
'Cause you know...

16:48.917 --> 16:50.583
this is the most
important ingredient.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.375
It's a secret.
No one tells you,

16:52.458 --> 16:54.875
but it what... it's what gives
the guacamole the-the thing.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.208
No, no, no, can't drink

16:56.291 --> 16:58.000
the secret ingredient. Mom!

17:00.417 --> 17:02.542
Okay, so Mom may be drinking,

17:02.625 --> 17:04.542
but she definitely doesn't
have a drinking problem.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.208
-No. Mom has a <i>Heather </i>problem.
-Yeah.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.834
Matt, you are moving up
in the world.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.875
-Welcome to the top two kids.
-Yeah.

17:11.959 --> 17:14.083
I hope you enjoy
inside jokes about Matt.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.500
I mean, Heather.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.375
Jokes about Heather.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.959
(footsteps approaching)

17:22.041 --> 17:24.250
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.208
-Um, we were talking...
-Mm.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.208
and-and we've noticed
that, uh,

17:28.291 --> 17:30.500
well, you seem
a little bit overwhelmed

17:30.583 --> 17:32.166
by having Heather here.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.959
Oh, no, no. It-It's joyous.

17:36.041 --> 17:39.083
It's like when a comet blazes
into the atmosphere,

17:39.166 --> 17:42.709
and primitive people everywhere
think the world is ending,

17:42.792 --> 17:45.500
and yet it may never come again
in your lifetime,

17:45.583 --> 17:47.625
and so you should treasure it.

17:47.709 --> 17:50.083
You do know that it is okay

17:50.166 --> 17:52.625
to say when Heather
is bothering you?

17:52.709 --> 17:54.792
She's not! Mm.
Uh...

17:54.875 --> 17:56.625
Heather means well.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.875
And that's why she deletes
entire seasons

17:59.959 --> 18:01.458
of <i>Shark Week</i>

18:01.542 --> 18:03.000
on the DVR.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.000
To free up space.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.500
Where's <i>JAG, </i>damn it?

18:06.583 --> 18:07.959
They don't make it anymore,

18:08.041 --> 18:10.000
and once you delete it,
they're gone forever.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.208
Yeah, okay.
Mom, the first step

18:13.291 --> 18:14.875
in dealing with
your Heather problem

18:14.959 --> 18:17.250
is <i>admitting </i>that you
have a Heather problem.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.750
(voice breaking):
You're right.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.625
I've hit rock bottom.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.333
(sighs)

18:23.417 --> 18:25.709
But don't tell Heather.

18:25.792 --> 18:27.834
She'll be crushed.

18:27.917 --> 18:30.417
Speaking of "crushed,"

18:30.500 --> 18:34.125
why don't we whip up a batch of
daiquiris before she gets back?

18:34.208 --> 18:35.709
Come on, kids.

18:35.792 --> 18:38.917
Yeah, I don't think Mom would
admit this, but I think

18:39.000 --> 18:42.333
maybe all the drinking is just
from her being overwhelmed.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.333
(laughs)
Oh, Greg, well, duh.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.291
I mean, yeah, of course,
she's overwhelmed

18:46.375 --> 18:48.041
with all of us here.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.959
Oh. No, I don't
think you understand.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.792
Her problem is actually with...

18:51.875 --> 18:53.417
Uh, uh, uh, it's okay.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.875
Heather gets it.

18:54.959 --> 18:58.375
Oh. I got it. Yeah. Oh.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.291
You are the best,
sweetest brothers.

19:01.375 --> 19:05.834
Part of being in the top two
is letting number three fail.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.917
Right on.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.750
Wait. Does that mean
that you guys...?

19:09.834 --> 19:13.375
Mm-hmm. For a long time.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.792
What-What's going on?

19:18.875 --> 19:21.375
We thought that you could
use some peace and quiet.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.959
TIM:
Yeah, so we're all going to Disneyland.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.417
I'm gonna fake sunstroke

19:24.500 --> 19:26.375
and then hang out
in the recovery tent all day.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.875
(laughs)
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

19:29.959 --> 19:31.458
HEATHER:
And while they're gone,

19:31.542 --> 19:35.208
you and I are gonna do
a little at-home spa day.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.917
-JOAN (slurring words): It's like a comet.
-HEATHER: Mm-hmm.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.125
It only comes once
in a lifetime,

19:44.208 --> 19:46.041
and you must treasure it.

19:46.125 --> 19:49.458
You are... you are really
feeling this.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.083
(doorbell rings)

19:51.166 --> 19:53.041
Oh! Oh.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.750
It's a man I'm excited
for you to meet!

19:55.834 --> 19:57.834
Oh, Mom, no!

19:57.917 --> 19:59.834
I am not divorcing Tim!

19:59.917 --> 20:01.709
You have to stop asking.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.500
(laughing)

20:05.667 --> 20:08.375
Heather, this is "Hecor."

20:09.417 --> 20:11.041
He's a contractor.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.667
He's gonna start
work on your house!

20:13.750 --> 20:16.125
You-You hired him?

20:16.208 --> 20:18.875
He's being paid a premium
to go extra fast,

20:18.959 --> 20:23.125
and that way, you can move
back to your own home.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.458
Oh, my gosh,
I can't wait to get started.

20:24.542 --> 20:25.959
Let me get my look book.

20:27.208 --> 20:30.875
Here. You're gonna need this.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.834
