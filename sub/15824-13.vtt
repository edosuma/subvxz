WEBVTT

00:17.585 --> 00:19.320
SHAW LOOKS PISSED --

00:19.353 --> 00:22.490
LIKE HE GOT STOOD UP
OR SOMETHING.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.630
I FIND NOTHING CONNECTING SHAW
TO THIS ADDRESS.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.764
I'LL MARK IT DOWN.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.606
NOW WHAT?

00:40.708 --> 00:41.809
HERE. LOOK.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.044
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.348
NO, BUT SHAW DOES.

00:51.352 --> 00:54.188
HEY.
HEY, WHAT WAS THAT?

00:54.222 --> 00:56.424
OH! THAT'S NOT GOOD.
NOT GOOD.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.297
COME ON, MORRIS.
WE GOT TO STOP THIS.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.402
HE'S GONNA KILL THIS GUY.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.603
YOU KNOW HE'S --
JUST WAIT.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.539
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN
TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY

01:11.572 --> 01:13.107
HOW WE SAT HERE AND FILMED A GUY
GETTING BEATEN TO DEATH

01:13.141 --> 01:14.208
INSTEAD
OF SAVING HIS LIFE?

01:17.478 --> 01:18.712
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, DAMN IT.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.782
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.185
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THEY'RE STOPPING.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.521
OH. FIGHT'S OVER.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.129
THE GUY SHAW BEAT UP NEEDS
AN AMBULANCE. I'M CALLING 911.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.666
WOMAN: 911.
What's your emergency?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.368
YEAH,
THIS IS AGENT BURNS, FBI.

01:40.401 --> 01:43.237
I NEED L.A.P.D. TO RESPOND
TO 1919 NORTH KINGSLEY STREET.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.805
TELL THEM WE NEED THE IDENTITY
OF THE VICTIM

01:44.838 --> 01:47.175
AND TELL THEM TO GET HERE QUICK
BEFORE HE DRIVES AWAY.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.877
YEAH, IT'S A DARK-BLUE PICKUP
PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY.
HEY, SHAW'S ON THE MOVE.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.346
GOD DAMN!
SHAW'S ON THE MOVE!
DRIVER NEEDS
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.814
L.A.P.D. NEEDS TO GET US
AN I.D. ASAP.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.183
LET'S GO, BURNS!
START THE VEHICLE! LET'S GO!

01:55.216 --> 01:56.584
YEAH, HE'S ALIVE.
HE'S ALIVE.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.252
HE'S BEAT TO HELL,
BUT HE'S ALIVE.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.254
WE'RE LOSING SHAW!
COME ON!

02:28.949 --> 02:30.451
WHERE'S CHIEF JOHNSON?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.253
UH, HER PARENTS DROPPED IN
FOR A QUICK VISIT,

02:32.286 --> 02:34.388
SO WE'VE DECIDED TO LEAVE HER
OUT OF THIS FOR NOW.

02:34.422 --> 02:37.291
WHAT DID THE FBI SAY
HAPPENED HERE?

02:37.325 --> 02:38.859
WELL, THE GUY I SPOKE TO,

02:38.892 --> 02:42.930
AN AGENT MORRIS, SAID THERE WAS
SOME KIND OF FISTFIGHT.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.299
BUT WHEN THEY LEFT,
THE VICTIM WAS STILL ALIVE.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.967
Flynn: WELL, IF IT
MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.337
THE FEDS ARE TELLING THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE FIGHT.

02:49.370 --> 02:53.341
THE BLOOD TRAIL STRETCHES
ABOUT 10 FEET THIS WAY,

02:53.374 --> 02:55.976
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S THE GUNSHOTS IN HIS HEAD

02:56.009 --> 02:56.977
THAT KILLED HIM.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.513
TWO, UP CLOSE.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.748
SO HERE'S THE TIMELINE.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.251
FBI DIALS 911
AT 7:32 P.M.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.518
RIGHT?

03:04.552 --> 03:07.388
OFFICERS ARE DISPATCHED,
ARRIVE AT 7:37 P.M.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.357
VICTIM IS D.O.A.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.492
SO WE'RE EXPECTED TO BELIEVE
THIS MURDER HAPPENED

03:11.525 --> 03:12.926
IN THE FIVE MINUTES
BETWEEN THE FBI LEAVING

03:12.960 --> 03:14.628
AND OUR OFFICERS
RESPONDING?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.964
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF OPERATION
IS THE FBI RUNNING

03:16.997 --> 03:18.866
THAT THEY LET THIS GUY
GET KILLED?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.468
Taylor:
SURVEILLANCE, PROVENZA.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.870
THEY JUST WANTED HIS NAME.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.805
REGISTRATION AND PLATES

03:24.838 --> 03:27.908
SAY HE'S A PAUL BURKE
OF SANTA MONICA, SIR.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.448
ALL RIGHT.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.783
LET ME CALL THE FBI.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.819
NO, NO, NO.
JUST HOLD ON, COMMANDER.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.288
HOLD ON.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.889
I-I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
THE FBI THIS NAME

03:41.922 --> 03:43.891
UNLESS WE GET WHAT WE NEED
IN RETURN.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.327
LIKE THE NAME OF THE GUY
THEY HAD UNDER SURVEILLANCE

03:46.360 --> 03:47.928
WHEN HE KILLED OUR VICTIM.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.897
A.K.A. OUR MAIN SUSPECT.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.499
THEY'LL NEVER GIVE US
THAT, ANDY.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.802
WELL,
NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.638
OUR BOY, JIMMY,
SAYS HE'S GONNA STAY

03:57.671 --> 03:59.940
UP IN MANHATTAN
FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.743
SAYS HE AND HIS ROOMMATE,
THAT FRANK,

04:02.776 --> 04:05.479
HAVE OTHER PLANS
FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

04:05.513 --> 04:08.316
I'D THINK HE'D SEEN ENOUGH
OF FRANK.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.619
I MEAN, THEY SHARE
THAT TINY, LITTLE APARTMENT,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.854
BOTH OF THEM SPLITTING
ONE BEDROOM.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.689
I-I JUST COULDN'T DO THAT.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.927
NOW, CLAY JR. --
HE'S WORKING SO MUCH

04:19.960 --> 04:22.696
THAT HE'S PROBABLY GONNA SPEND
CHRISTMAS IN HIS OFFICE.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.964
WELL, YOU KNOW,

04:23.997 --> 04:25.599
YOU AND WILLIE RAY
ARE ALWAYS WELCOME

04:25.633 --> 04:27.601
TO SPEND THE HOLIDAYS
WITH US IF YOU --

04:27.635 --> 04:29.337
AND DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON BOBBY!

04:30.471 --> 04:31.972
I'M NOT RUNNING DOWN
MY KIDS.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.841
DON'T YOU GET THAT IDEA
AT ALL.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.877
BUT NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BREAK
AWAY TO MEET US FOR CHRISTMAS.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.379
THAT'S JUST MIND-BOGGLING.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.780
HELLO?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.015
UH, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,
CHIEF.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.085
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOUR HUSBAND
FOR A MINUTE.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.554
WHY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:46.587 --> 04:48.088
OH, YOU KNOW, NOTHING.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.692
UM, JUST LOOKING FOR SOME
BACKGROUND  INFO.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.826
WOW, THIS WAS UP-CLOSE
AND PERSONAL.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.928
A lot of sooting.
SOOTING?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.398
LIEUTENANT,
I

04:57.431 --> 04:58.999
UH, CHIEF, I...

04:59.032 --> 05:01.335
I-I NEED YOU TO PUT
SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD

05:01.369 --> 05:02.436
ON THE PHONE, PLEASE.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.671
LET'S MOVE
THE BODY ON 3.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.606
1, 2, 3.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.774
BODY?!
LIEUTENANT!

05:07.708 --> 05:09.777
DID HE HANG UP ON ME?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.112
WHERE'S MY CELL?

05:16.984 --> 05:17.951
HELLO?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.953
YES, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.955
PROVENZA: I have a victim
under surveillance.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.091
UH, IS THAT -- WHY --

05:24.124 --> 05:25.493
GIVE ME THE PHONE.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.827
THE WORD IS "PLEASE."

05:26.860 --> 05:28.462
"PLEASE GIVE ME
THE PHONE."

05:28.496 --> 05:29.897
YEAH, LIEUTENANT,
GO ON.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.465
I need to ask you about
an Agent Morris

05:31.499 --> 05:33.000
who's dealing with it.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.803
Yes, Lieutenant, we have
several surveillance situations

05:35.836 --> 05:36.904
going on right now.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.772
THE CHIEF.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.475
Could you give me
a few more details?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.778
Are you there,
Lieutenant?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.680
Hello?
UH, YEAH,

05:46.714 --> 05:48.949
THIS AGENT MORRIS
ADMITS TO WITNESSING

05:48.982 --> 05:51.385
MOST OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR VICTIM,

05:51.419 --> 05:52.853
WHOSE NAME THE FBI WANTS,

05:52.886 --> 05:54.655
AND I CAN GIVE YOU THAT,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.924
BUT IN RETURN,
I WANT THE NAME

05:56.957 --> 06:00.594
of the guy that Morris
had under surveillance.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.900
UH, NOW, IF HE TURNS OUT
NOT TO BE THE SHOOTER,

06:06.934 --> 06:10.504
HE COULD BE THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE OUR VICTIM ALIVE.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.441
WILL NO ONE PICK UP THEIR PHONE?

06:13.474 --> 06:16.143
SO, YOU, UH,
YOU WANT TO TRADE INFO.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.411
PROVENZA: That's right.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.547
THE IDENTITY
OF OUR DEAD GUY

06:19.580 --> 06:21.915
FOR THE NAME
OF YOUR SUSPECT.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.852
OKAY, LIEUTENANT.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.820
LET'S DO IT.
YOU FIRST.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.590
Ah. Yes.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.592
UH, WELL, THE VICTIM
IS PAUL BURKE

06:31.625 --> 06:32.893
FROM SANTA MONICA.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.029
WORKED FOR THE LAURA B
CATERING COMPANY.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.766
CATERING.
VERY INTERESTING.

06:38.799 --> 06:43.471
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WITH
THE NAME YOU WANTED SHORTLY.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.539
HELLO. NO, UH...
AGENT HOWARD.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.674
FRITZ.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.580
HE'LL...
HE'LL GET BACK TO ME...

06:52.613 --> 06:53.814
SHORTLY, HE SAID.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.485
NOT ME.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.789
UH, LIEUTENANT, IT'S --

07:06.259 --> 07:07.828
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

07:07.861 --> 07:09.563
I'VE NEVER BEEN TREATED
LIKE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.931
IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS --
IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE

07:10.964 --> 07:12.132
AND NOT YOUR BUSINESS
AT THE MOMENT.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.166
CLAY...

07:13.200 --> 07:15.503
WILLIE RAY, I'M SO SORRY.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.205
I HATE TO LEAVE.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.608
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT JUST CAN'T WAIT.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.942
OH, WE UNDERSTAND.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.777
CRIME DOESN'T STOP
FOR DINNER IN THIS HOUSE.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.679
MATTER OF FACT,
IT PAYS FOR DINNER.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.883
YOU GO MAN
THOSE BARRICADES, SON.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.619
FRITZ.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.620
CLAY.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.023
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU...

07:36.056 --> 07:40.528
HOW VERY PROUD
WE ARE OF YOU.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.530
T-THANK YOU, CLAY.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.631
HOW VERY PROUD.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.898
THANK --
THANKS VERY MUCH.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.534
HONEY...
Fritz: THANK YOU.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.802
...HE HAS TO GO.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.212
IF YOU'RE MEETING MY DIVISION,
I'M GOING, TOO.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.814
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.216
THIS IS CLASSIFIED FBI BUSINESS.
TOP SECRET.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.252
TOP SECRET?
L-LIKE THE WAY YOU PAID GAVIN

08:05.285 --> 08:07.621
AND DIDN'T TELL ME --
THAT KIND OF TOP SECRET?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.757
OH. YEAH, THAT WAS
HORRIBLY SELFISH OF ME,

08:09.790 --> 08:11.792
USING MY INHERITANCE
FOR YOUR LEGAL FEES.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.127
THE THINGS I HIDE!

08:14.161 --> 08:15.529
LOOK, IF YOU'RE
REALLY INTERESTED

08:15.563 --> 08:17.064
IN UNCOVERING
SOME SECRETS,

08:17.097 --> 08:18.699
WHY DON'T YOU FIND OUT
THE REASON

08:18.732 --> 08:20.534
BEHIND YOUR PARENTS'
BLITZ VISIT

08:20.568 --> 08:22.235
AND WHY YOUR MOTHER
IS SO QUIET

08:22.269 --> 08:24.304
OR THAT HUG
YOUR DAD JUST GAVE ME?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.639
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

08:25.673 --> 08:26.640
Willie Ray: BRENDA?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.075
SAY GOODBYE TO FRITZI

08:28.108 --> 08:30.744
AND BRING IN
THE REST OF THE DINNER.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.013
ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

08:33.046 --> 08:34.281
BUT YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO

08:34.314 --> 08:36.283
SPEND SOME TIME ALONE
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.285
I LOVE YOU.
I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.321
BYE!

08:41.354 --> 08:44.057
Tell her right now when
there's no distraction. Shh.
NO.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.194
WELL, I GUESS IT'S JUST US
FOR DINNER, THEN.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.097
WHICH MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER

08:50.130 --> 08:54.635
TO SAY WHAT IT IS
YOU FLEW OUT HERE TO TELL ME.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.706
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY TOO SERIOUS
TO TALK ABOUT ON THE PHONE.

08:58.739 --> 09:03.611
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST HAVE
A NICE DINNER WITH EACH OTHER,

09:03.644 --> 09:05.579
AND THEN WHEN
FRITZI COMES BACK --
ENOUGH, WILLIE RAY.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.180
ENOUGH.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.850
LET'S JUST...

09:09.883 --> 09:10.984
GET IT OUT THERE.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.654
CLAY...NOT RIGHT BEFORE
WE EAT.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.589
THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE
A GOOD TIME!

09:15.623 --> 09:16.590
DAMN IT!

09:16.624 --> 09:17.758
DOCTOR SAID

09:17.791 --> 09:19.159
DON'T TAKE AWAY
MY CONTROL!

09:21.261 --> 09:22.996
DOCTOR?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.067
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR,
DADDY?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.837
WELL...

09:29.870 --> 09:32.706
I'VE HEARD
YOU POLICE PEOPLE SAY,

09:32.740 --> 09:36.209
"I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
AND SOME BAD NEWS."

09:36.243 --> 09:39.079
WELL, SO DO I.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.150
GOOD NEWS IS...

09:43.183 --> 09:45.819
I'M NOT GONNA DIE.

09:45.853 --> 09:49.356
BAD NEWS IS, WELL...

09:49.389 --> 09:50.924
I'VE GOT CANCER.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.202
THERE IT IS.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.253
HEY.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.822
THAT'S TERRIBLE NEWS
ABOUT YOUR DAD.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.824
HOW'S HE FEELING
THIS MORNING?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.292
I DON'T KNOW.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.661
LET'S -- LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT LATER.
OKAY.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.843
EVERYONE, THIS IS
SPECIAL AGENT MORRIS.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.979
HE'S ONE OF THE GUYS
WHO FILMED THE CONFRONTATION

10:46.013 --> 10:48.982
BETWEEN OUR VICTIM
IN THE PICKUP, PAUL BURKE,

10:49.016 --> 10:50.217
AND THE OTHER GUY.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.720
WHO WE SHOULD CALL
"THE ASSAILANT"?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.887
THE NAME OF
OUR SURVEILLANCE SUBJECT

10:53.921 --> 10:54.922
IS ERIC SHAW.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.892
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
YES.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.329
I WANT TO THANK AGENT MORRIS
FOR FILMING THE MURDER FOR US.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.900
THERE'S NO MURDER
ON THAT TAPE, DETECTIVE.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.336
WE WOULD HAVE HEARD
THE TWO GUNSHOTS BEFORE WE LEFT.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.805
Provenza:
YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE...

11:11.839 --> 11:14.174
YOU GETTING ERIC SHAW'S NAME
BACK TO ME

11:14.207 --> 11:15.709
IN SUCH A TIMELY MANNER,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.110
BUT YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
IF WE ALL FEEL

11:17.144 --> 11:19.379
THAT THERE MAY BE
SOME STRINGS ATTACHED.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.048
NOT STRINGS --
CHAINS.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.283
Fritz: ERIC SHAW IS THE LINCHPIN
IN AN INVESTIGATION

11:23.316 --> 11:26.386
INVOLVING INTERSTATE TRAFFICKING
OF STOLEN PROPERTY.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.756
OH, WHOOPTY-DO.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.892
Morris:
THROUGH WORK BY OUR FIELD
OFFICERS IN MIAMI AND NEW YORK,

11:31.925 --> 11:34.394
WE'VE JUST SUCCEEDED
IN TRACING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

11:34.427 --> 11:36.263
IN FURNITURE, ART,
AND ELECTRONICS

11:36.296 --> 11:38.098
TO BURGLARIES
HERE IN LOS ANGELES,

11:38.131 --> 11:40.834
AND TO ERIC SHAW THROUGH PAWN
SHOPS HE OPERATES IN FLORIDA

11:40.868 --> 11:43.103
AND AUCTION HOUSES
IN MANHATTAN HE DEALS WITH.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.305
WE'VE HAD HIM UNDER
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE NOW

11:45.338 --> 11:46.907
FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.009
HOPING TO DISCOVER THE DETAILS
OF HIS OPERATION.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
WE THINK YOUR VICTIM
PROVIDED US WITH THE KEY.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.312
PAUL BURKE AND ERIC SHAW

11:52.345 --> 11:54.281
WERE PARTNERS
IN A CATERING COMPANY

11:54.314 --> 11:57.084
WE NOW THINK WAS USED TO CASE
EXPENSIVE HOMES

11:57.117 --> 11:58.251
IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.988
THE BLUE DOTS
REPRESENT HOMES

12:01.021 --> 12:02.489
BURGLARIZED IN THE LAST YEAR
IN L. A.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.225
THESE YELLOW DIAMONDS
SHOW HOMES

12:05.258 --> 12:08.061
WHERE BURKE'S COMPANY MET
ABOUT A JOB.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.198
SO, SHAW CATERED EVERY RESIDENCE
THAT HE ROBBED,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.901
AND YOU GUYS JUST NOW
PUT THAT TOGETHER?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.468
NO, BRIGHT EYES.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.337
EVEN YOU L.A.P.D. MUTTS
COULD HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT.
MUTTS?

12:17.370 --> 12:19.072
HEY, HEY, LIEUTENANT,
LIEUTENANT, LIEUTENANT.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.109
THEY DIDN'T CATER
ANY OF THESE HOMES. ALL RIGHT?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.044
ONCE THEY GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT THE HOUSES,

12:24.077 --> 12:25.512
THEY WOULD INTENTIONALLY
OVERBID THE JOB.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.280
THAT WAY, ANOTHER COMPANY
WOULD COME IN

12:27.314 --> 12:28.882
AND WORK THE PARTY,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.317
AND BURKE AND SHAW
WOULD COME BACK LATER

12:30.350 --> 12:31.885
AND BURGLARIZE THE HOUSE.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.153
Brenda:
SO THE CATERING CONNECTION

12:33.186 --> 12:34.788
WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.789
YES.YES.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.990
BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT

12:37.024 --> 12:38.491
THAT IF WE CAN EXPLOIT
THIS LEAD,

12:38.525 --> 12:40.127
WE CAN CLOSE OUR CASE

12:40.160 --> 12:42.362
AND WE CAN ROLL UP
SHAW'S ENTIRE ORGANIZATION.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.031
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT OUR MURDER?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.565
WE WANT THE L.A.P.D.
TO FEEL FREE TO PURSUE THAT

12:45.598 --> 12:47.935
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T DISRUPT
OUR SURVEILLANCE OF SHAW.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.937
BUT SHAW IS OUR SUSPECT.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.571
Morris: NO, HE'S NOT.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.241
WE JUST SHOWED YOU VIDEO PROVING
SHAW DIDN'T MURDER ANYBODY.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.276
Flynn:
SO WHERE'S THE VIDEO OF SHAW

12:56.309 --> 12:58.545
FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING?
OR BEFORE?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.380
WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW US THAT?!

13:02.615 --> 13:04.417
WAIT -- WAIT A MINUTE.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.353
UM, DID WE MAKE
OUR NOTIFICATIONS?

13:06.386 --> 13:09.056
YEAH. UH, CHIEF,
LATE LAST NIGHT,

13:09.089 --> 13:11.825
WE TALKED TO BURKE'S WIFE
AND SON.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.326
Provenza:
AND WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP THERE

13:13.360 --> 13:15.495
BECAUSE THE VICTIM
HAD JUST TOLD HIS WIFE

13:15.528 --> 13:17.097
HE WANTED A DIVORCE.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.232
THE BURKES ARE ON THEIR WAY IN
RIGHT NOW, CHIEF.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.533
THERE.
PEOPLE YOU CAN TALK TO.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.902
AND DIVORCE --

13:21.935 --> 13:23.270
THAT'S A GREAT MOTIVE
FOR MURDER.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.537
SO, OTHER SUSPECTS.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.874
JUST DON'T MENTION
THE NAME ERIC SHAW

13:26.907 --> 13:28.876
OR ANYTHING
ABOUT A THEFT RING.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.410
UNDERSTOOD?

13:30.443 --> 13:32.612
WELL, THAT SOUNDS QUITE A BIT
MORE LIKE A COMMAND

13:32.645 --> 13:34.281
THAN AN ASK, AGENT MORRIS,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.016
AND ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT

13:36.049 --> 13:38.451
THAT MOST OF THESE BURGLARIES
AND CERTAINLY THIS MURDER

13:38.485 --> 13:41.488
TOOK PLACE IN THE CITY
OF LOS ANGELES,

13:41.521 --> 13:43.356
WHERE I HAPPEN TO BE
CHIEF OF POLICE.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.392
WE GET TO SET THE PRIORITIES
ON THIS ONE.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.194
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT CLEARING

13:47.227 --> 13:49.496
ALMOST 40 OF
YOUR OPEN CASES, WILL.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.830
THAT'S A WIN-WIN
FOR EVERYONE.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.138
LET'S INTERVIEW
THE FAMILY FIRST,

13:58.171 --> 13:59.940
SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.374
WE'D DO THAT ANYWAY.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.609
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THE BRIEFING, AGENT MORRIS.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.089
EXCUSE ME.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.490
DO YOU WORK FOR ME

14:17.524 --> 14:19.159
OR FOR YOUR HUSBAND?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.427
HONESTLY, WILL,

14:20.460 --> 14:22.195
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN WORK AT ALL RIGHT NOW.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.965
OKAY. LOOK, IF -- IF YOU'RE
FEELING MORE STRESSED OUT

14:24.998 --> 14:26.666
ABOUT THIS
FEDERAL LAWSUIT...

14:26.699 --> 14:28.535
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.371
IT'S MY -- IT'S MY FATHER.
HE'S REALLY SICK.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.306
HE JUST TOLD ME
LAST NIGHT.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.175
Oh, God, Brenda.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.543
I'M S--
I'M SO SORRY.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.514
I-I THINK
MAYBE I SHOULD...

14:41.548 --> 14:43.616
GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,
WILL.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.185
I KNOW IT'S NOT SCHEDULED,
BUT...

14:45.218 --> 14:46.653
NO, THAT'S...

14:46.686 --> 14:48.288
UH

14:48.321 --> 14:51.258
WHAT -- WHAT EXACTLY IS WRONG
WITH YOUR DAD?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.660
THYROID CANCER.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.396
I LOOKED IT ALL UP
LAST NIGHT ONLINE.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.300
DADDY'S GONNA SUFFER
FROM HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.002
EXHAUSTION, MOOD SWINGS.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.703
HE PRACTICALLY BIT
MY MOTHER'S HEAD OFF LAST NIGHT.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.306
YOU KNOW...

15:06.339 --> 15:08.041
IT...

15:08.075 --> 15:11.644
IT MIGHT BE EASIER ON YOUR MOM
AND DAD THAN YOU THINK.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.180
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

15:13.213 --> 15:14.347
BECAUSE THEY'RE HERE NOW,

15:14.381 --> 15:15.648
HANDING OUT GIFTS.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.519
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.924
[ TELEPHONE RINGING,
POLICE RADIO CHATTER ]

15:26.226 --> 15:29.029
IS THAT A SNOWMAN WEARING
A POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.630
Willie Ray: IT IS!

15:30.663 --> 15:34.167
AND WHEN CLAY AND I SAW IT,
WE JUST KNEW YOU SHOULD HAVE IT.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.135
WELL, THANK YOU.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.370
HOW GREAT.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.972
HEY.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.474
YOU SHOULD BE HOME,
RESTING.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.276
WE'RE ONLY GONNA BE HERE
TWO MORE DAYS.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.744
WE WANT TO MAKE
THE MOST OF IT.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.114
SPREADING A LITTLE HOLIDAY CHEER
NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.748
UH, EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.350
OH, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ!

15:50.383 --> 15:53.386
THE LAST LITTLE BOY
ON SANTA'S ROUTE.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.992
WE KNEW THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A LOT OF THESE AT HOME,

15:59.026 --> 16:01.094
BUT THESE ARE FOR WORK.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.563
FELIZ NAVIDAD, DETECTIVE.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.200
OH! WONDERFUL!

16:07.234 --> 16:09.169
THANK YOU.
I MEAN, GRACIAS.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.339
CHIEF, THE VICTIM'S FAMILY'S
HERE, AND --

16:12.372 --> 16:14.074
OH, UH, ONE SECOND,
DETECTIVE.

16:14.107 --> 16:17.044
LOOK, DADDY, I THINK
I SHOULD DRIVE Y'ALL HOME.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.645
OH, BRENDA LEIGH,

16:18.678 --> 16:21.248
WHEN HAVE I EVER WANTED YOU
TO MAKE A BIG FUSS OVER ME?

16:21.281 --> 16:26.153
IF YOU DON'T DO YOUR JOB,
IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL WORSE.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.154
NOW, YOU GO ON.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.388
GO ON, NOW.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.556
WE'RE AMONG FRIENDS.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.124
OKAY.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.659
UH, DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
YOU CAN BRING THE FAMILY IN.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.461
I CAN'T.
WHY NOT?

16:34.494 --> 16:35.595
YOU'LL SEE.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.498
EXCUSE ME.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.609
IS THAT...

16:49.642 --> 16:50.743
YES, MA'AM, ERIC SHAW.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.745
WHAT ON EARTH
IS HE DOING HERE?

16:52.779 --> 16:55.515
HIS SISTER, LAURA,
WAS OUR VICTIM'S WIFE.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.687
PAUL BURKE WAS ERIC SHAW'S
BROTHER-IN-LAW,

17:00.720 --> 17:02.155
AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.457
Morris: LOOK,
WE ONLY VERY RECENTLY

17:04.491 --> 17:06.359
CONNECTED SHAW
TO THESE ROBBERIES.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.295
I THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM
UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.729
HOW IS IT HE'S JUST SHOWING UP
IN MY BREAK ROOM

17:09.762 --> 17:11.264
WITHOUT YOU KNOWING IT?

17:11.298 --> 17:12.565
THESE INVESTIGATIONS
ARE COMPLEX. WE DON'T --

17:12.599 --> 17:14.434
YOU LOST HIM LAST NIGHT...
DIDN'T YOU?

17:15.802 --> 17:17.570
OH, MY.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.607
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHAW
DIDN'T JUST CIRCLE THE BLOCK

17:20.640 --> 17:22.642
AND THEN COME BACK
AND SHOOT MY VICTIM?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.311
OH, THERE'S NO PROOF
OF THAT.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.712
WELL, I'LL GIVE HIM PROOF
WHEN I SHOW HIM THAT VIDEO...

17:25.745 --> 17:27.414
NO, NO, NO, BRENDA!
...THAT YOU MADE LAST NIGHT.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.648
IF SHAW KNOWS WE'RE ONTO HIM,
WE'D LOSE OUR CHANCE

17:28.681 --> 17:29.782
TO TAKE DOWN THE REST
OF HIS RING.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.284
WE WANT EVERYONE.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
YOU CANNOT QUESTION HIM.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.721
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.723
TALK TO EVERYONE ELSE
IN THE VICTIM'S FAMILY

17:36.756 --> 17:38.691
AND COMPLETELY IGNORE SHAW --
IS THAT IT?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.260
DON'T YOU THINK
HE'LL NOTICE?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.528
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.196
I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW WE'LL HANDLE THIS.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.469
SORRY, CHIEF. JUST, UH,
CLEARING THE TABLE FOR YOU.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.870
Brenda:
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.872
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.707
Gabriel:
UH, DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON,

17:54.741 --> 17:56.243
THIS IS MR. BURKE'S WIFE,
LAURA,

17:56.276 --> 17:57.777
AND THEIR SON, IAN.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.247
AND THIS IS LAURA'S
BROTHER AND SISTER,

18:00.280 --> 18:01.614
ERIC AND EMILY SHAW.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.716
AND THIS IS...

18:04.917 --> 18:08.388
I'M FRITZ HOWARD,
AND I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.623
HE'LL BE TAKING NOTES.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.192
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE,
MRS. BURKE,

18:12.225 --> 18:13.593
FOR ASKING YOU
AND YOUR SON

18:13.626 --> 18:16.196
TO COME DOWN HERE SO SOON
AFTER A TRAGEDY LIKE THIS,

18:16.229 --> 18:18.265
BUT WE DO HAVE SOME
FORMAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.433
Eric: WHAT KIND OF FORMAL
QUESTIONS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:20.467 --> 18:21.901
MY SISTER'S IN SHOCK.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.903
SHE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
RIGHT NOW.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.772
ERIC, ERIC, IT'S FINE.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.507
I-I WANT TO HELP.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.775
PLEASE.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.443
Gabriel: OKAY.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.212
WELL, WE NEED TO START
WITH ASKING EACH OF YOU

18:32.245 --> 18:35.648
WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT
BETWEEN 6:00 P.M. AND 9:00 P.M.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.185
UM, I WAS AT HOME
WITH IAN,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.853
AND I MADE DINNER,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.690
AND WE TALKED
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.691
ABOUT?

18:47.427 --> 18:51.264
I WAS THINKING I SHOULD
TAKE SOME TIME OFF FROM COLLEGE.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.732
MOM DIDN'T WANT ME TO.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.368
AND, "EMILY," IS IT?

18:55.402 --> 18:56.803
YEAH.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.539
I WAS, UM, AT MY APARTMENT
WATCHING A CHRISTMAS MOVIE.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.174
AND I WAS WITH HER.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.445
WHICH MOVIE WAS THAT?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.347
"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE."

19:08.515 --> 19:09.849
YEAH, RIGHT.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.318
MORE LIKE "FIGHT CLUB."

19:11.351 --> 19:13.353
HEY, MORRIS.
HERE'S A LITTLE TIP.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.722
WHEN FOLLOWING SOMEONE,
WHEREVER THEY GO,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.190
YOU GO.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.725
MRS. BURKE,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

19:18.758 --> 19:20.360
WHAT YOUR HUSBAND WAS DOING
IN HOLLYWOOD LAST NIGHT?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.694
NO.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.896
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.499
ANY CATERING JOBS?
NO.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.569
WE -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY
CLIENTS IN THAT AREA RIGHT NOW.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.338
DO WE, ERIC

19:31.371 --> 19:32.772
NO.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.475
OH, ARE ALL OF YOU IN THE
CATERING BUSINESS TOGETHER?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.609
BUT NOT WORKING...

19:36.643 --> 19:39.246
IN THAT AREA
AND NOT LAST NIGHT.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.580
SO...

19:40.613 --> 19:42.949
SO, IT WAS STRANGE
YOUR HUSBAND BEING THERE?

19:42.982 --> 19:45.452
DAD DID A LOT
OF STRANGE THINGS LATELY.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.320
IN WHAT WAY?

19:47.354 --> 19:48.888
HOW ABOUT COMING HOME
LAST WEEK

19:48.921 --> 19:50.490
AND TELLING MY MOTHER HE'S NOT
IN LOVE WITH HER ANYMORE?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.825
AND THEIR MARRIAGE IS OVER...

19:52.859 --> 19:54.994
BECAUSE HE JUST DECIDED IT WAS.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.830
AND TELLING ME
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.666
IS THAT STRANGE ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

19:59.699 --> 20:00.800
'CAUSE IT'S PRETTY STRANGE
TO ME.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.635
IAN, IAN.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.272
YOUR DAD...
WAS A GOOD MAN.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.773
LAURA, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.009
NO. NO. DON'T AIR IT HERE.
WHAT WHAT?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.478
EMILY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.815
I'M SORRY YOU GOT TO FIND OUT
LIKE THIS.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.451
BUT PAUL WAS WHERE
THEY FOUND HIM LAST NIGHT

20:18.485 --> 20:19.686
BECAUSE HE WAS SLEEPING
WITH CLAUDIA.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.257
CLAUDIA SHIPLEY?

20:24.291 --> 20:26.326
YOUR EX

20:26.359 --> 20:27.794
SHE -- SHE WORKS FOR US!

20:27.827 --> 20:29.262
YEAH.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.930
YOU FOUND HIM IN HOLLYWOOD
LAST NIGHT

20:30.963 --> 20:33.666
BECAUSE HE WAS LEAVING
HER APARTMENT.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.402
OH, MY GOD!

20:35.435 --> 20:37.437
Provenza: WE NEED TO FIND
THIS CLAUDIA SHIPLEY.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.971
CLAUDIA?

20:39.005 --> 20:41.508
ARE YOU --
ARE YOU SURE, ERIC?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.943
YES, I'M SURE.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.313
I FOUND OUT WHEN SHE TEXTED ME
BY MISTAKE,

20:46.346 --> 20:47.980
THINKING I WAS PAUL.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.983
OH, SO BOTH OF YOU WERE SLEEPING
WITH THIS CLAUDIA SHIPLEY?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.453
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE PART
ABOUT HER BEING MY EX?!

20:54.621 --> 20:56.756
PAUL WAS CHEATING
ON MY LITTLE SISTER.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.057
THAT'S WHAT BOTHERED ME.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.861
AND DID YOU...CONFRONT HIM
ABOUT THIS?

21:01.894 --> 21:05.432
WE ASK ABOUT A CONFRONTATION,
MR. SHAW,

21:05.465 --> 21:07.934
BECAUSE WE ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND LIVED.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.469
AND THERE WERE SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE

21:09.502 --> 21:11.571
IN THE DRIVEWAY OUTSIDE
HER APARTMENT BUILDING.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.406
Emily:
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE PAUL

21:13.440 --> 21:14.974
WAS PISSING OFF MORE PEOPLE
THAN JUST US.

21:15.007 --> 21:18.878
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GETS INTO MEN
AFTER THEY TURN 40.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.380
I REALLY DON'T.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.614
Laura:
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.616
PAUL WAS NOT
SEEING CLAUDIA.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.785
YEAH, LAURA...
HE WAS.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.054
MR. SHAW,
I NEED TO ASK YOU --
MRS. BURKE, IAN...

21:28.087 --> 21:31.524
YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH
A TERRIBLE ORDEAL,

21:31.558 --> 21:33.793
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT
CHIEF JOHNSON AND THE L.A.P.D.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.863
ARE GONNA WORK TIRELESSLY
TO CONCLUDE THIS INVESTIGATION.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.365
IN THE MEANTIME, I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO TAKE UP

21:38.398 --> 21:39.799
ANY MORE OF YOUR TIME
THIS MORNING.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.468
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING IN.

21:41.501 --> 21:45.071
AND AGAIN, WE'RE VERY, VERY
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.339
DETECTIVE?

21:46.373 --> 21:47.374
THANK YOU.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.009
THANK YOU.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.578
THANK YOU.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.846
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.085
SORRY I'M LATE.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.687
BIG PILE-UP ON THE 405,

22:00.720 --> 22:03.890
BEEN BACKED UP WITH TRAFFIC
FATALITIES ALL MORNING.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.359
YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:06.393 --> 22:07.660
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DOWN,

22:07.694 --> 22:09.529
AND YOU HAVEN'T
INTERRUPTED ME YET.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.698
UH, I-I WAS
JUST WONDERING --

22:11.731 --> 22:14.801
DO YOU KNOW HOW SERIOUS
THYROID CANCER CAN BE?

22:14.834 --> 22:16.736
BY THE TIME I USUALLY
FIND IT IN SOMEONE,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.070
IT'S EXTREMELY SERIOUS.
WHY?

22:19.706 --> 22:20.940
MY FATHER HAS IT.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.410
OH. NO.
WHAT STAGE?

22:23.443 --> 22:24.944
FIRST. FIRST.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.414
OH. DON'T WORRY.

22:27.447 --> 22:28.781
THYROIDECTOMY.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.650
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE
SURGERY.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.984
VERY SIMPLE.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.821
AND POST-OP, HE'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIND A BALANCE.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.956
WHEN YOU SAY
"SIMPLE SURGERY,"

22:36.989 --> 22:38.691
HOW SIMPLE IS IT,
REALLY?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.693
LIKE THIS.
SEE?
OHH...

22:40.727 --> 22:41.961
HERE'S THE VICTIM'S
THYROID.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.463
I GRABBED IT
WHILE WE WERE TALKING.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.864
IT'S THAT EASY.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.699
OF COURSE, YOUR FATHER
WILL HAVE TO BE ANESTHETIZED,

22:46.733 --> 22:48.868
AND THEY SHOULDN'T CUT
THROUGH HIS NECK LIKE THAT,

22:48.901 --> 22:50.136
BUT STILL...

22:50.169 --> 22:51.604
DOCTOR,
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

22:51.638 --> 22:52.972
OH, DON'T WORRY.
THIS GUY WON'T MISS IT.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.173
THYROID --

22:54.206 --> 22:55.742
THAT'S GREEK FOR "SHIELD."

22:55.775 --> 22:57.977
LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE SHIELD,
DOESN'T IT?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.112
AND THEY GUARD US, TOO,
THYROIDS.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.014
THEY KEEP US FROM HAVING
EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWNS

23:02.048 --> 23:03.750
AND CRIPPLING
MOOD SWINGS.

23:03.783 --> 23:07.153
JUST THINK OF IT AS A REGULATOR
FOR YOUR INNER DIVA.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.922
SO THAT'S IT?

23:09.956 --> 23:11.558
JUST A QUICK LITTLE SURGERY
AND THE PERSON RECOVERS?

23:11.591 --> 23:14.861
WELL, NOT THIS GUY,
BUT GENERALLY, YES.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.496
RECOVER.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.997
NOW, YOUR FATHER WILL HAVE
TO WATCH HIS CALCIUM LEVELS

23:18.030 --> 23:19.599
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.568
HIS EMOTIONS WILL BE
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.836
BUT I'M SURE
HE'LL FIND A BALANCE.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.171
I CAN TELL YOU THIS MUCH.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.173
THE PROCEDURE USUALLY
WORKS OUT BETTER

23:27.206 --> 23:29.976
THAN GETTING SHOT TWICE
IN THE HEAD.

23:30.009 --> 23:30.977
OUCH.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.879
AND BEATEN UP, TOO.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.547
YOUR VICTIM
HAD A VERY BAD NIGHT.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.749
THERE'S A LOT OF SOOTING
AT THE WOUNDS,

23:36.783 --> 23:39.118
SO THE WEAPON WAS DISCHARGED
AT CLOSE RANGE.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.954
HMM, BUT WHAT'S
REALLY INTERESTING

23:41.988 --> 23:43.456
IS THE MARK ON THE SCALP.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.558
SEE THIS BRUISING
AROUND THE BULLET HOLES?

23:45.592 --> 23:49.696
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE
TATTOO OF THE MURDER WEAPON.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.098
A SMALL
DOUBLE-BARRELED GUN.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.233
BUT WHAT KIND,
I WONDER?

23:54.266 --> 23:57.236
Tao: A .41-CALIBER
DERRINGER, CHIEF.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.005
Brenda:
OKAY, WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,

23:59.038 --> 24:01.207
THAT MAKES FOR A PRETTY RARIFIED
MURDER WEAPON.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.543
LIEUTENANT FLYNN, WOULD YOU
PLEASE LOOK INTO REPORTS

24:03.576 --> 24:05.211
ON MISSING DERRINGERS

24:05.244 --> 24:07.079
AND SALES OF BULLETS
THAT WENT WITH IT?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.180
YEAH, I'LL CHECK SOME
PAWN SHOPS, TOO.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.181
YOU NEVER KNOW.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.683
CHIEF?

24:10.717 --> 24:12.819
GOT CLAUDIA SHIPLEY
IN INTERVIEW 2.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.621
OH, GOOD.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.556
AND, UH...OH.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.125
DO YOU REALLY NEED
TO SIT NEXT TO ME

24:19.158 --> 24:20.893
AND PASS NOTES
LIKE WE'RE IN HOMEROOM?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.062
WHAT DO YOU CARE
ABOUT THIS WOMAN?

24:23.095 --> 24:24.997
SHE WAS SHAW'S
EX-GIRLFRIEND.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.133
AFTER WHICH SHE WAS DATING
MY VICTIM.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.602
WHAT DOES CLAUDIA SHIPLEY HAVE
TO DO WITH YOUR INVESTIGATION?

24:29.636 --> 24:30.803
Gabriel: UH, CHIEF?

24:30.837 --> 24:32.238
WHEN WE PICKED CLAUDIA UP,

24:32.271 --> 24:34.173
SHE WAS AT THE AIRPORT
ON HER WAY TO BRAZIL

24:34.206 --> 24:37.043
WITH $1.8 MILLION
IN HER CARRY-ON.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.144
THAT SOUNDS
A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.748
LOOK, WE ARE WORKING
A MURDER HERE,

24:41.781 --> 24:43.516
NOT A BUNCH
OF BURGLARIES.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.184
AND IF CLAUDIA SHIPLEY
REALLY IS THE KILLER,

24:45.217 --> 24:46.753
WHICH IS PROBABLY
THE CASE,

24:46.786 --> 24:48.588
AND SHE'S FLEEING
WITH HUGE WADS OF CASH,

24:48.621 --> 24:50.156
THEN YOU SHOULD THANK ME
FOR FINDING HER

24:50.189 --> 24:54.561
SO THE FBI WON'T LOOK LIKE
THE WOR COPS ON EARTH

24:54.594 --> 24:55.862
FOR HAVING LOST SHAW
TO BEGIN WITH.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.830
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE MORE ANGRY

24:57.864 --> 24:59.165
THAN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
WARRANT.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.934
AND WE BOTH KNOW WHY.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.003
YOUR PARENTS NEED
A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION

25:04.036 --> 25:06.005
THAN THE L.A.P.D. DOES
THIS AFTERNOON.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.306
LET ME INTERVIEW CLAUDIA.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.942
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO SPEND SOME MORE TIME

25:09.976 --> 25:11.177
WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.081
I CANNOT...

25:15.114 --> 25:16.549
BELIEVE...

25:16.583 --> 25:18.918
THAT YOU WOULD USE
MY FATHER'S CANCER

25:18.951 --> 25:21.120
TO MANIPULATE ME INTO GIVING UP
THIS INTERVIEW.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.723
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!

25:23.756 --> 25:25.825
IT IS AWFUL,
JUST SHAMEFUL.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.226
SHAMEFUL.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.702
THAT REALLY SHOULD
HAVE WORKED.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.169
YOU'D THINK!

25:37.203 --> 25:40.539
SHE'S GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

25:43.342 --> 25:46.679
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MS. SHIPLEY.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.581
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

25:48.615 --> 25:49.916
I'M SO SORRY TO HAVE INTERRUPTED
YOUR TRIP TO BRAZIL.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.051
BUT WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS

25:52.084 --> 25:54.120
ABOUT AN INCIDENT
THAT HAPPENED

25:54.153 --> 25:55.888
OUTSIDE OF YOUR APARTMENT
BUILDING.

25:55.922 --> 25:59.291
DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE OR HEAR
ANYTHING UNUSUAL

25:59.325 --> 26:02.328
LAST NIGHT, EARLY EVENING,
AROUND 7:30?

26:02.361 --> 26:04.897
WELL, YES, I HEARD
THERE WAS A MURDER.

26:04.931 --> 26:05.898
DID YOU KNOW THE VICTIM?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.900
I DON'T...THINK SO.

26:07.934 --> 26:11.203
UH, I WASN'T THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.173
SO, CLAUDIA, YOU'RE COMPLETELY
UNAWARE OF THE FACT

26:14.206 --> 26:16.743
THAT THE VICTIM LAST NIGHT
WAS YOUR BOSS

26:16.776 --> 26:19.078
FROM THE CATERING COMPANY,
PAUL BURKE?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.715
WHAT?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.753
OH, MY GOD.
NO, YOU'RE KIDDING. WHY?

26:26.786 --> 26:30.222
WHAT WAS MR. BURKE DOING
AT MY APARTMENT BUILDING?

26:30.256 --> 26:31.958
WE WERE WONDERING
THE SAME THING.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.293
DO YOU AND MR. BURKE SEE
EACH OTHER OUTSIDE OF WORK?

26:34.326 --> 26:36.028
NO. GOD, HE WAS MARRIED.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.231
CLAUDIA, WE HAVE
THE VICTIM'S CELLPHONE,

26:39.265 --> 26:41.768
AND IT'S FULL
OF TEXT MESSAGES...

26:41.801 --> 26:43.135
FROM YOU.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.975
SO WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT
BETWEEN 6:00 P.M. AND 9:00 P.M.?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.376
I WAS ON A FILM SET...

26:50.409 --> 26:53.079
WITH A LOT OF OTHER
BACKGROUND ARTISTS.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.380
I WAS DOING A MOVIE.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.315
OH. YOU'RE AN ACTOR.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.185
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A WAITER
FOR A CATERING COMPANY.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.152
I DO BOTH.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.821
WORKING TWO JOBS --

27:01.854 --> 27:03.289
THAT EXPLAINS
THE $1.8 MILLION

27:03.322 --> 27:05.958
THAT YOU WERE TAKING ON
YOUR SPONTANEOUS TRIP TO BRAZIL.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.126
ALL RIGHT.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.728
ALL RIGHT.

27:08.761 --> 27:09.862
I KNEW PAUL HAD BEEN MURDERED,
AND I WAS SCARED.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.698
WHY?
'CAUSE OF THAT MONEY.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.800
PAUL WAS KEEPING IT
AT MY APARTMENT.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.267
AND NOW PAUL WAS DEAD.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.436
SO I THOUGHT SOMEONE
MIGHT KILL ME TO TAKE IT.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.205
WELL, CLAUDIA,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

27:19.238 --> 27:20.339
THAT WE ARE GETTING READY
TO SEARCH YOUR APARTMENT

27:20.372 --> 27:21.674
RIGHT THIS MINUTE.
WAIT.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.246
YOU'RE GONNA...
SEARCH MY PLACE?

27:27.279 --> 27:28.748
YES, WE ARE!

27:28.781 --> 27:30.717
OKAY.

27:30.750 --> 27:31.984
UM...

27:35.187 --> 27:37.356
ARE YOU THE PERSON
THAT CAN...

27:37.389 --> 27:38.991
MAKE DEALS?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.260
SURE.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.729
I CAN MAKE A DEAL.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.732
THE REASON
THAT I BRING THIS UP

27:45.765 --> 27:48.935
IS, WHEN YOU'RE SEARCHING
MY APARTMENT,

27:48.968 --> 27:52.238
YOU MIGHT FIND
SOME FURNITURE,

27:52.271 --> 27:55.274
UM, SOME ART THINGS...

27:55.307 --> 27:58.745
SILVER, MAYBE,
THAT MIGHT BE...

27:58.778 --> 28:00.446
I DON'T KNOW,
STOLEN PROPERTY.

28:00.479 --> 28:05.317
BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT I DID
NOT TAKE ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.219
BUT NO GUN?
NO! ARE YOU KIDDING?

28:07.253 --> 28:09.321
I HATE GUNS!

28:09.355 --> 28:10.757
SO HOW DID ALL THIS
STOLEN PROPERTY MAKE IT
INTO YOUR APARTMENT --

28:10.790 --> 28:12.925
MISS SHIPLEY?

28:12.959 --> 28:14.927
I'M SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD
OF THE FBI.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.162
THIS IS
SPECIAL AGENT MORRIS.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.898
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
IN ADVANCE

28:18.931 --> 28:20.299
THAT DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON'S
"DEALS"

28:20.332 --> 28:23.035
ALMOST ALWAYS INCLUDE
A LOT OF PRISON TIME.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.137
AND THOSE MADE BY THE FBI
INVOLVE SOMETHING CALLED

28:25.171 --> 28:26.405
THE WITNESS PROTECTION
PROGRAM.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.808
NOW, I THINK, HONESTLY,

28:28.841 --> 28:31.110
YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF
COMING WITH US.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.380
YOU'D REALLY SEND ME
TO PRISON?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.515
YEAH. PROBABLY.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.155
YOU KNOW, GUYS,

28:43.189 --> 28:44.891
YOU'RE WELCOME.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.226
I'M GLAD WE COULD FIND SOMEONE
TO HELP YOU WRAP UP YOUR CASE.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.461
FUNNY, I-I DON'T REMEMBER
SAYING "THANK YOU."

28:56.869 --> 28:58.404
HEY, CHIEF.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.872
IT'S NOT ALL BAD.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.373
IT ISN'T?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.243
HOMELESS GUY WAS ARRESTED
WITH THIS THIS MORNING.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.878
SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF SOME DRIVERS

29:05.912 --> 29:07.947
WHEN HE WAS PANHANDLING
WITH IT.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.782
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SQUEEGEE.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.884
HERE.
LET ME SEE THAT.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.452
HE'S STILL IN BOOKING.

29:13.485 --> 29:17.223
HE SAID HE FOUND IT NEAR
THE LA BREA OFF-RAMP OF THE 10.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.058
HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.092
SEE

29:20.126 --> 29:23.029
LINES UP. HUH?
PERFECT FIT.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.296
NOW, LOOK AT THIS.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.365
MATCHES THE WOUND
AND THE BRUISING.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.001
THIS DERRINGER WAS STOLEN
FROM THIS HOUSE

29:29.035 --> 29:30.336
IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS,

29:30.369 --> 29:31.838
WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
ONE OF THE HOUSES

29:31.871 --> 29:33.172
THAT THE GANG BURGLARIZED.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.174
NOW, THERE ARE NO PRINTS
ON THE GUN...

29:35.207 --> 29:37.143
BUT THAT TIES IT TO SHAW.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.344
WE NEED TO DO MORE

29:38.377 --> 29:39.912
THAN JUST TIE IT TO HIM,
LIEUTENANT.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.014
WE NEED TO PUT IT
IN HIS HAND.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.150
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
HOW TO DO THAT YET.

29:44.183 --> 29:47.319
YOU THINK WE SHOULD SHARE
THIS INFORMATION WITH THE FBI?

29:47.353 --> 29:48.855
OH, SURE.

29:48.888 --> 29:52.258
JUST AS SOON AS WE FIGURE OUT
HOW TO USE IT.

29:56.963 --> 30:00.332
SO, DID CLAUDIA SHIPLEY
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER?

30:00.366 --> 30:02.334
YOU KNOW I CAN'T REVEAL
WHAT CLAUDIA TOLD ME.

30:02.368 --> 30:04.336
MY INTERVIEW WITH HER LANDED
YOU A MAJOR PIECE OF INFORMATION

30:04.370 --> 30:05.905
THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN OTHERWISE.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.339
THANK YOU, MAMA.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.875
SHE SERVED HER PURPOSE.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.177
YOU MEAN SHE SERVED
YOUR PURPOSE.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.980
SO, WHAT, YOU FOUND LOTS
AND LOTS OF STOLEN GOODS
AT HER APARTMENT,

30:14.013 --> 30:15.614
AND SOME OF THEM CAME FROM SHAW,
IS THAT IT?

30:15.647 --> 30:19.151
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK
THAT WE FINISH OUR DESSERT

30:19.185 --> 30:22.054
BEFORE YOU TWO START YAMMERING
ABOUT A MURDER?!

30:22.088 --> 30:25.557
CLAY, DON'T DO THIS
TO YOURSELF.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.126
YOU'RE TIRED.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.129
YOU NEED TO FINISH YOUR PIE
AND GO TO BED.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.630
DO NOT TELL ME
WHAT TO DO!

30:31.663 --> 30:33.232
I DO NOT NEED --

30:33.265 --> 30:36.602
BUT, DADDY, MAMA WAS JUST SAYING
THAT YOU WERE TIRED.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.137
AND DON'T YOU INTERRUPT ME,
BRENDA LEIGH!

30:38.170 --> 30:39.205
I MEAN IT, NOW.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.941
IF I AM TIRED,

30:41.974 --> 30:45.311
IT'S BECAUSE I'M TIRED
OF PEOPLE TELLING ME I'M TIRED,

30:45.344 --> 30:47.646
ESPECIALLY YOU,
WILLIE RAY.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.115
I AM BONE-WEARY

30:49.148 --> 30:51.383
OF THE WORD "TIRED"!

30:51.417 --> 30:56.088
NOW, Y'ALL CAN GO BACK
TO IGNORING ME

30:56.122 --> 30:58.090
BECAUSE NOW I AM
GOING TO BED.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.465
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

31:06.498 --> 31:09.635
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.304
IS HE LIKE THAT EVERY DAY,
WILLIE RAY?

31:12.338 --> 31:14.306
NO, NO.
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.475
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN LIVES
TO DEAL WITH.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.946
MAMA, THIS IS TOO MUCH
FOR YOU TO MANAGE ON YOUR OWN.

31:19.979 --> 31:24.483
LOOK, I HAVE VACATION DAYS
ALL STORED UP,

31:24.516 --> 31:26.986
AND -- AND I'LL COME OUT
TO ATLANTA TO VISIT YOU

31:27.019 --> 31:28.554
JUST AS SOON
AS YOU WANT ME TO.

31:28.587 --> 31:33.625
WELL, YOUR FATHER AND I
WOULD LOVE THAT, BRENDA LEIGH.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.695
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY,
REALLY.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.232
WE HAVE THE SURGERY
THE FIRST OF THE YEAR.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.502
THEN CLAY HAS
HORMONE-REPLACEMENT THERAPY,

31:43.535 --> 31:46.705
AND THAT TAKES A FEW WEEKS
TO GET RIGHT.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.541
SO I'M THINKING
THAT AFTER THE SURGERY

31:49.575 --> 31:52.411
WOULD BE THE BEST TIME,
IF YOU WANT TO.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.712
WE DO. WE DO.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.349
WELL, I CAN BOOK
THE TICKETS FOR --

31:57.383 --> 31:58.584
THE SECOND WEEK
IN JANUARY.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.652
IF YOU CAN.

32:00.686 --> 32:04.390
THAT WOULD BE
A WONDERFUL TREAT.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.726
HAVING MORE OF
THE FAMILY TOGETHER

32:07.759 --> 32:10.162
MIGHT HELP YOUR FATHER
RECOVER FASTER.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.164
THE TRUTH IS,

32:12.198 --> 32:15.667
CLAY THINKS THAT HE HAS
COMPLETELY DEALT

32:15.701 --> 32:18.504
WITH THIS DIAGNOSIS,
AND HE HASN'T.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.207
I HAVE TO
HELP HIM UNDERSTAND

32:21.240 --> 32:23.175
THAT HE HASN'T
DEALT WITH IT.

32:24.776 --> 32:28.247
I TELL YOU --
THIS PIE IS DELICIOUS.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.182
Y'ALL OUGHT TO
TRY A BITE.

32:30.216 --> 32:33.252
NOW, I'M GONNA GO IN
AND GIVE CLAY A PEP TALK.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.686
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.535
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

32:51.770 --> 32:55.541
THAT SOME FAMILIES ARE EASIER
TO BRING TOGETHER THAN OTHERS.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.382
A WISCONSIN MAN VACATIONING
HERE IN LOS ANGELES

33:03.415 --> 33:06.285
REPORTED SEEING A GUN
BEING THROWN FROM A VEHICLE

33:06.318 --> 33:09.088
ALONG THE 10 FREEWAY
JUST AFTER THE MURDER.

33:09.121 --> 33:12.024
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DRIVER
WAS LOST AT THE TIME

33:12.058 --> 33:14.293
AND NOT SURE WHERE
ALONG THE FREEWAY

33:14.326 --> 33:15.627
HE SAW THE WEAPON
GET DUMPED.

33:15.661 --> 33:16.795
AND AS YOU KNOW,

33:16.828 --> 33:18.497
IT'S A LONG STRETCH
OF ROAD.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.300
Tao: SO, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS WE'RE GONNA DETAIL

33:21.333 --> 33:24.470
10 PATROL OFFICERS
TO FIND THIS GUN.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.607
WE'LL START HERE, CHECK SOME
OF THE FREEWAY INTERCHANGES,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.543
AND STOP AT THE EXIT
NEAREST THE APARTMENT.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.245
TAKES ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.147
BECAUSE
IT'S A SMALL WEAPON

33:35.181 --> 33:37.116
AND IT WON'T BE EASY
TO FIND.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.185
Provenza:
WE OWE IT TO ALL OF YOU

33:39.218 --> 33:41.553
TO LOOK FOR IT
JUST AS HARD AS WE CAN.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.189
WILL THAT SOLVE THE CASE?

33:43.222 --> 33:47.059
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
I DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.561
THIS IS...

33:49.595 --> 33:53.532
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED MY LIFE
TO BE ABOUT.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.334
EXCUSE ME.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.304
EXCUSE ME.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.307
WELL, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN, IAN.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.674
SIT DOWN.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.244
LAURA WILL WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS LATER.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.245
AND SO WILL YOU.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.549
GO ON, DETECTIVE.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.418
WELL, IF,
WHEN WE CAN LOCATE THE WEAPON

34:12.451 --> 34:14.220
WE CAN CONNECT IT
TO AN INDIVIDUAL...

34:14.253 --> 34:16.322
I thought we already
found the gun.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.856
We did.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.226
Now we're just...encouraging
someone else to go hunt for it.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.727
...WE FOUND A TON OF
STOLEN GOODS IN HER APARTMENT,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.562
AND IF CLAUDIA TURNS UP,

34:23.595 --> 34:26.465
WE'RE HOPING SHE'LL BE ABLE
TO HELP US SORT THINGS OUT.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.753
YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?

35:24.890 --> 35:26.425
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.693
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE,

35:27.726 --> 35:30.662
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU
BY THE STATE.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.531
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THESE RIGHTS, EMILY?

35:32.564 --> 35:33.832
YEAH.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.781
THIS IS ALL
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.318
NO, IT'S NOT.
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.
[ DOOR CLOSES,
ENGINE TURNS OVER ]

35:52.351 --> 35:54.753
YOU CAME BACK HERE
TO RECOVER A MURDER WEAPON.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.555
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.558
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
YOU...TOSSED IT...

35:59.591 --> 36:00.826
...FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.295
LET'S SEE, UM,
YOUR SISTER, LAURA.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.896
HER HUSBAND ASKED
FOR A DIVORCE.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.499
SHE FINDS HIM IN CLAUDIA'S
APARTMENT AND SNAPS.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.835
HOW ABOUT YOUR NEPHEW?

36:09.868 --> 36:12.604
WAS THE PAIN OF WATCHING
HIS FATHER LEAVE HIS MOTHER

36:12.638 --> 36:13.839
TOO MUCH TO BEAR?

36:13.872 --> 36:15.441
OKAY, LEAVE THEM
OUT OF THIS.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.975
OR MAYBE IT WAS
YOUR BROTHER, ERIC.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.444
PAUL WAS DIVORCING HIS SISTER

36:18.477 --> 36:20.212
AND SLEEPING
WITH HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.548
NO. NO.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.550
THE GUN'S MINE.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.584
ERIC GAVE IT TO ME.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.952
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

36:26.985 --> 36:28.520
YEAH. ME...

36:28.554 --> 36:31.690
MY BROTHER --
WE'RE THE BLACK SHEEP.

36:33.425 --> 36:34.826
WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.763
THAT'S WHY WHEN ERIC GOT
CLAUDIA'S TEXT BY MISTAKE,

36:37.796 --> 36:42.268
I KNEW -- I KNEW HE WAS GONNA
LOSE IT WITH PAUL.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.602
SO I FOLLOWED HIM.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.572
AND YOU WATCHED HIM
BEAT UP PAUL?

36:46.605 --> 36:47.739
YEAH.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.741
YEAH, I WAS GONNA JUMP OUT
AND STOP HIM

36:49.775 --> 36:51.009
IF HE WENT TOO FAR.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.010
BUT HE DIDN'T.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.645
AND THEN,

36:53.679 --> 36:55.314
AFTER ERIC LEFT,

36:55.347 --> 36:58.850
I -- I EVEN WENT TO CHECK
ON THE ASSHOLE.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.387
DIDN'T WANT PAUL TO BLEED
TO DEATH OR ANYTHING,

37:01.420 --> 37:04.423
ESPECIALLY NOT BEFORE HE TOLD US
WHERE HE'D TAKEN ALL THE MONEY

37:04.456 --> 37:05.657
WE TRUSTED HIM TO HOLD.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.959
AND HOW WAS HE

37:09.995 --> 37:11.963
HE'D BEEN AFRAID
OF EVERYTHING

37:11.997 --> 37:15.267
HE WAS GONNA LOSE
IN THE DIVORCE.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.835
BUT AFTER THE FIGHT,

37:16.868 --> 37:18.504
HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID,

37:18.537 --> 37:23.375
NOW...HE COULD WALK AWAY
FROM LAURA,

37:23.409 --> 37:26.712
AND HE'D OWE HER NOTHING.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.946
AND HE TOLD ME

37:27.979 --> 37:29.047
THAT HE'S GONNA TAKE
ALL THE MONEY

37:29.080 --> 37:30.516
THAT WE MADE
IN THE BURGLARIES,

37:30.549 --> 37:33.485
WHICH REALLY WASN'T FAIR.

37:33.519 --> 37:34.753
AND THEN HE SAID,

37:34.786 --> 37:36.355
HE...

37:36.388 --> 37:38.757
HE SAID,
"THAT CRAZY BITCH I MARRIED

37:38.790 --> 37:41.059
"WILL FINALLY GET
WHAT SHE DESERVES

37:41.092 --> 37:43.629
FOR GIVING ME
SUCH A WORTHLESS SON."

37:43.662 --> 37:46.898
SO I TOOK THE GUN
OUT OF MY PURSE,

37:46.932 --> 37:49.701
AND I SHOT HIM
IN THE HEAD.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.304
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY,

37:52.338 --> 37:53.772
I SHOT HIM.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.043
IF YOU WERE ONLY FOLLOWING
YOUR BROTHER

37:58.076 --> 37:59.645
BECAUSE YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM,

37:59.678 --> 38:01.847
WHY DID YOU HAVE
A LOADED GUN IN YOUR PURSE?

38:01.880 --> 38:05.050
I...

38:05.083 --> 38:08.687
I HAD BEEN CARRYING THAT
DERRINGER AROUND FOR MONTHS.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.788
I LIKED IT.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.958
AND I NEVER LIKED IT MORE

38:12.991 --> 38:15.661
THAN WHEN I WAS BLOWING
PAUL'S HEAD OFF.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.576
WE FINISHED BOOKING EMILY,
SO I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.843
OH, GREAT.
THANK YOU.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.812
UM...

38:33.845 --> 38:36.582
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME
BUTTING IN,

38:36.615 --> 38:38.984
MY SISTER
HAD THYROID CANCER.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.987
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.123
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT --

38:45.156 --> 38:46.492
OH. YOUR FATHER

38:46.525 --> 38:47.926
WHEN THEY WERE HANDING OUT
THE GIFTS --

38:47.959 --> 38:50.095
"MERRY CHRISTMAS.
I'VE GOT CANCER."

38:50.128 --> 38:52.664
THERE'S NO EASY WAY
TO SAY IT, I GUESS.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.902
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.004
H

38:59.037 --> 39:00.906
OH, SHE'S FINE NOW.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.442
BUT I LEARNED A LOT
FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.911
LIKE

39:05.944 --> 39:07.446
WELL...

39:07.479 --> 39:10.516
NO MATTER HOW FRUSTRATED
I GOT WITH HER,

39:10.549 --> 39:12.684
I ALWAYS TRIED TO KEEP
HER BEST INTERESTS AT HEART,

39:12.718 --> 39:14.820
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T ABLE
TO DO THAT FOR HERSELF.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.888
YOU'LL SEE.

39:16.922 --> 39:20.426
BUT IF YOU EVER NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

39:20.459 --> 39:21.693
I KNOW STUFF.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.396
THANKS. THANKS.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.665
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.133
GOOD NIGHT.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.476
OH, SORRY.
AM I LATE?

39:37.509 --> 39:39.878
UH, WHAT TIME
IS THE RESERVATION?

39:39.911 --> 39:41.613
YOU'RE GOOD.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.915
VERY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

39:45.684 --> 39:48.754
I HOPE WE'RE NOT GOING ANYPLACE
TOO CHICHI.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.422
WELL, MAMA,
IT'S YOUR LAST NIGHT HERE.

39:50.456 --> 39:51.923
WE HAVE TO GO SOMEPLACE
A LITTLE UPTOWN.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.725
BEFORE WE GO,

39:53.759 --> 39:57.496
I'D LIKE TO...
SAY SOMETHING.

39:57.529 --> 40:02.568
I-I'M SORRY THAT I WAS SO SHORT
WITH EVERYBODY LAST NIGHT.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.136
Y'ALL DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.707
ESPECIALLY YOU,
WILLIE RAY.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.942
I KNOW I COULDN'T GO
THROUGH THIS

40:10.976 --> 40:12.210
WITHOUT Y'ALL.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.779
SO, FROM NOW ON,

40:13.812 --> 40:16.982
I'M GONNA BE
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.183
I PROMISE.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.919
AND IF ANYTIME
I FAIL TO DO THAT,

40:20.952 --> 40:23.955
YOU SHOULD FEEL FREE
TO HIT ME OVER THE HEAD

40:23.989 --> 40:25.056
OR SOMETHING.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.125
NO, NO, I MEAN IT.

40:27.158 --> 40:30.529
HIT ME IN THE HEAD
UNTIL I PULL IT ALL TOGETHER.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.499
I DON'T THINK
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY...

40:33.532 --> 40:36.802
BUT I'LL KEEP IT IN MIND.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.506
DADDY, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU, TOO.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.741
I SPOKE TO JIMMY
AND BOBBY

40:42.774 --> 40:44.543
AND CLAY JR. TODAY,

40:44.576 --> 40:48.146
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA COME VISIT
YOU AFTER CHRISTMAS.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.615
Willie Ray:
OH, NOW, CLAY,

40:49.648 --> 40:51.116
ISN'T THAT NICE?

40:51.149 --> 40:53.719
BUT THE BOYS
WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT ME

40:53.752 --> 40:55.654
ALL DURING CHRISTMAS.

40:55.687 --> 40:59.658
WILLIE RAY, I THINK WE SHOULD
GET ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW

40:59.691 --> 41:01.760
AND -- AND -- AND
SETTLE THIS THING,

41:01.793 --> 41:02.928
TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.730
WE CAN DO THAT
BEFORE DINNER.

41:04.763 --> 41:08.033
CLAY, IT'S THREE HOURS LATER
ON THE EAST COAST.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.836
NOW, DON'T START
BOSSING ME AROUND!

41:10.869 --> 41:12.270
WHEN I MAKE A DECISION,

41:12.303 --> 41:14.239
IT DEPENDS ON THE NEEDS
OF THE MOMENT,

41:14.272 --> 41:16.808
THE FACTS,
AND THE CRISIS AT HAND.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.511
NOW, I WILL NOT
HAVE MY SON --

41:30.055 --> 41:34.660
WE HAVE RESERVATIONS,
CLAY.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.897
IT'S KIND OF A GREAT PLACE,
TOO, DADDY.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.065
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.

41:46.905 --> 41:49.240
THANK YOU, FRITZ.

41:49.274 --> 41:50.742
ANYTIME, CLAY.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.514
ANYTIME AT ALL.
