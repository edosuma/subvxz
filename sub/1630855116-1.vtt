00:28.097 --> 00:31.272
What do you want? Let me go!

00:34.586 --> 00:37.485
This is my house!
What do you want?

00:52.293 --> 00:53.915
Hello, Dr. Muller.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.504
What is this? What's going on?

00:56.642 --> 00:58.782
You've been
injected with a microchip,

00:58.920 --> 01:01.268
a consciousness communications
device we've been developing

01:01.406 --> 01:02.855
here at the organization.

01:02.993 --> 01:04.926
What do you know
about Project Z Plus?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.964
- Almost nothing.
- It's funny.

01:08.102 --> 01:10.656
It's been said that humans
are the only species

01:10.794 --> 01:13.797
with a true understanding
of the concept of time,

01:13.935 --> 01:18.147
but, as it turns out, time
is actually rather malleable.

01:18.285 --> 01:20.010
What is time in reality other

01:20.149 --> 01:23.566
than a concept of our
own interpretation?

01:25.947 --> 01:29.434
This pill allows us to
interpret that sense

01:29.572 --> 01:32.609
of time differently.

01:33.748 --> 01:36.475
An hour here for an hour there.

01:36.613 --> 01:39.340
Today, tomorrow
forwards, backwards,

01:39.478 --> 01:43.310
consciousness, time travel.
I don't have any.

01:45.001 --> 01:49.971
No. If you had,
you'd have known we were coming.

01:51.145 --> 01:54.976
Tell me, do you know the
whereabouts of this man?

01:56.633 --> 01:58.635
That man? He's dead?

02:01.776 --> 02:02.605
Sure.

02:03.985 --> 02:07.299
My information tells me
he was rather generous

02:07.437 --> 02:09.198
in sharing his
information with you.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.372
He was a colleague in
the science community.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.789
That is all. I am sorry.

02:15.583 --> 02:19.553
Sir, we found
something. Uploading now.

02:24.213 --> 02:26.180
Thank you, Dr. Muller.

Where is she? 2:05, Movieland.

04:22.917 --> 04:23.642
She's coming.

04:28.613 --> 04:29.648
Welcome to tomorrow.

04:39.624 --> 04:40.797
There's little to no security,

04:40.935 --> 04:42.351
so this should be
relatively simple.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.007
These should get
you to the elevator

04:44.145 --> 04:45.837
and up to the 13th floor.

04:45.975 --> 04:48.357
They hire an external vendor
for the afternoon cleanup.

04:48.495 --> 04:52.499
- And the target is?
- White boarding room, 1334.

04:54.363 --> 04:55.881
I can never see shit
in these contacts.

04:56.019 --> 04:59.471
You and me keep going
in with purple eyes, so.

04:59.609 --> 05:01.024
Will you be able
to see the target?

05:01.162 --> 05:04.856
- Maybe. It won't be perfect.
- Well, we need perfect.

05:04.994 --> 05:07.134
Keep 'em in until
the target's in view.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.343
Okay. Everything will
just be blurry until then.

05:09.481 --> 05:10.724
Good. Remember, no details.

05:10.862 --> 05:12.173
We don't want to know
what this company does,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.417
who works there, nothing.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.880
Lee, Martin, can you hear me?

05:29.018 --> 05:30.330
Loud and clear

05:34.610 --> 05:35.852
Fucking contacts.

05:44.033 --> 05:47.070
Hold it, hold it,
hold, hold! Phew.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.400
Didn't you guys
switch to mornings?

06:06.538 --> 06:10.128
I could've swore I got
that memo last week.

06:10.266 --> 06:14.235
Shit, the cleaning
schedule's from last month.

06:15.202 --> 06:16.237
Oh, oh.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.722
That's for daylight
savings, sir.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.587
We don't switch
over till next week.

06:20.725 --> 06:23.762
Oh, okay. Well, good for you.

06:25.350 --> 06:27.939
I hate those dark
mornings. Take care.

06:29.906 --> 06:32.909
- Thanks Martin.
- Oh, anytime, Finn.

06:52.066 --> 06:53.343
We're in. You're up, Finn.

06:53.482 --> 06:55.138
- Ready?
- We're ready.

06:55.276 --> 06:56.208
Showtime.

07:01.317 --> 07:02.974
May I
have your attention please?

07:03.112 --> 07:04.354
This is not a drill.

07:04.493 --> 07:07.910
At the building, do
not use the elevators.

07:08.048 --> 07:11.741
After you leave the
building, please wait.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.371
Can't see shit.

07:35.593 --> 07:37.180
- How are we on time?
- 10 Minutes.

07:37.318 --> 07:38.354
We should be fine.

07:46.086 --> 07:46.880
I'll go inside.

07:47.018 --> 07:48.709
You get the look at the girl.

07:48.847 --> 07:49.676
Oh, no.

07:53.714 --> 07:57.580
Not sure you
needed me for this one.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.725
Finn. Where are
you? Finn, hello?

08:04.863 --> 08:06.037
We're getting ambushed.

08:06.175 --> 08:08.177
Just get out and meet
me at the loading dock.

08:08.315 --> 08:10.386
I ditched the van for
now. We'll get it later.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.564
- We work for-
- Quiet.

08:17.635 --> 08:19.257
I found 'em.
Copy.

08:21.984 --> 08:23.537
Come on, let's go.

08:28.335 --> 08:31.545
Lee, Martin,
where are you guys?

08:31.683 --> 08:35.894
Can you tell us who you
are or where we're going?

08:37.447 --> 08:40.554
This would make sense
with the mask and all.

08:40.692 --> 08:44.593
Open the door. Come on.

09:25.841 --> 09:28.395
- You okay?
- Yeah. We're okay.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.777
You really like
those tranquilizers.

09:30.915 --> 09:31.985
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

09:32.123 --> 09:34.366
Who are those guys?
I have no idea.

09:34.504 --> 09:35.298
We need to get away

09:35.436 --> 09:37.093
from here before we switch back.

09:37.231 --> 09:38.716
Finn, you have the car jacker.

09:38.854 --> 09:41.373
Yeah. I have it. It's
not ready, but I have it.

09:41.511 --> 09:44.342
50-50 shot it'll work.
50-50?

09:44.480 --> 09:46.413
- Maybe 60-40.
- Do it.

09:47.517 --> 09:49.796
Pick us up in the back.
Motherfucker.

10:10.161 --> 10:11.611
How we doing, Finn?

10:11.749 --> 10:13.716
Two minutes
until we jump back!

10:13.854 --> 10:17.168
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Where the fuck is she?

10:20.067 --> 10:21.379
Got it.

10:30.457 --> 10:32.079
One minute!

10:36.014 --> 10:39.190
For Christ's sake,
this isn't tea time!

10:42.296 --> 10:43.470
Let's go.

10:43.608 --> 10:44.644
I'm sure you'll
thank me later.

10:44.782 --> 10:47.129
- We're not out yet.
- 40 seconds!

10:51.443 --> 10:52.375
Well shit.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.174
Jesus Christ, Finn!

11:15.502 --> 11:18.747
Five seconds. See
you in the truck.

11:27.652 --> 11:29.102
Well, that was a shit show.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.759
We'll talk about
it when we get back.

11:48.259 --> 11:49.778
We have to do something.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.227
Look, what if we just,

11:51.365 --> 11:52.677
we change the dates.
Stop. You know the rules.

11:52.815 --> 11:54.334
We don't do anything
that will affect tomorrow

11:54.472 --> 11:56.957
between 2:05 and 3:05 PM.

11:57.095 --> 11:57.889
Martin.

11:59.097 --> 12:00.961
Your rules are going
to get us killed.

12:01.099 --> 12:02.376
They're the only things
that are keeping our feet

12:02.514 --> 12:03.619
on the ground.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.655
Do you have the target?
Yeah.

12:05.794 --> 12:07.796
Again, don't think you
needed me for that.

12:07.934 --> 12:11.282
Maybe, maybe not, but I
don't have photographic memory.

12:11.420 --> 12:13.940
It needs to be verbatim.
I'm worried about this.

12:14.078 --> 12:16.390
Come on, Finn. The
car jacker worked, right?

12:16.528 --> 12:19.324
Whoa, whoa, wait. What happens
when it does it work, Finn?

12:19.462 --> 12:20.670
All the electronics
in the car seize up

12:20.809 --> 12:22.949
for 30 seconds and
we get locked inside.

12:23.087 --> 12:24.329
- Oh.
- But it did work.

12:24.467 --> 12:25.814
- Oh.
- And that means that it

12:25.952 --> 12:27.574
is your job to make sure
that it still works tomorrow,

12:27.712 --> 12:29.887
and then when we get
out of the city safely,

12:30.025 --> 12:33.580
we'll figure out the rest.
Where are you going?

12:33.718 --> 12:35.755
I gotta get up early tomorrow,

12:35.893 --> 12:38.688
see the representative,
get our money.

12:38.827 --> 12:41.657
See you two tomorrow
at the spot.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.623
Hey.

12:44.453 --> 12:45.972

are the effects of
consciousness time trading.

15:24.751 --> 15:27.443
You see, your mind is
reordering its events.

15:27.581 --> 15:28.997
I saw...

15:29.135 --> 15:32.621
You saw tomorrow, and
tomorrow, you'll see today.

15:56.817 --> 15:58.543
The money should be in
your account within the hour.

15:58.681 --> 15:59.372
Thanks.

16:02.202 --> 16:04.791
By the way, the
offer still stands.

16:04.929 --> 16:06.241
You hand over the supply,

16:06.379 --> 16:09.865
and I promise you can
name any number you want.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.867
Not interested.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.663
May I at least have your name?

16:15.698 --> 16:19.530
Have a good day.

16:25.777 --> 16:26.709
You okay?

16:28.953 --> 16:30.403
Yeah.

16:30.541 --> 16:31.887
You ready?
Yep.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.421
- Welcome to yesterday.
- Now we wait.

16:54.392 --> 16:55.773
Okay, tell me again.

16:55.911 --> 16:57.533
What exactly is the plan
once you're back in the car?

16:57.671 --> 17:00.571
We wake up, we drive out
of town, and we assess.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.573
So basically wing it.

17:11.858 --> 17:12.928
10 seconds.

17:16.414 --> 17:17.726
Three, two, one.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.184
- Get us outta the city.
- On it.

17:40.128 --> 17:41.267
Oh!

17:41.405 --> 17:43.165
I don't know who
the fuck that was,

17:43.303 --> 17:46.479
but they weren't no
match for Lee Warner!

17:46.617 --> 17:48.791
Coming in in the red shorts,

17:48.929 --> 17:53.727
weighing 175 pounds,
Lee Warner!

17:54.970 --> 17:57.006
What exactly did you
do in this operation?

17:57.145 --> 18:00.251
Amateur hour all day,
every day. 50-50, Finn.

18:00.389 --> 18:04.221
50-50, 60-40. No,
I'm just saying.

18:04.359 --> 18:05.394
Oh, fuck.

18:08.639 --> 18:09.743
Fucking Christ. Go!

18:12.919 --> 18:14.576
Go! Goddammit, Finn!

18:32.421 --> 18:34.837
What was that?
It won't go.

18:34.975 --> 18:35.907
The brakes are locked up.

18:36.045 --> 18:38.047
60, 40 on that
car jacker, huh?

18:38.186 --> 18:39.911
All right, we're
out. We're on foot.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.849
Hey! Hey, it won't open!

18:51.371 --> 18:56.307
- Where the fuck's Martin?
- Motherfucker! It won't open!

18:56.790 --> 18:57.653
I can't!

19:02.106 --> 19:03.314
Fuck.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.263
Oh, shit.
No!

20:22.255 --> 20:23.394
I'm into the future.

20:23.532 --> 20:25.120
I'm at tomorrow and I
spend an hour there,

20:25.258 --> 20:27.053
but that hour is
actually here today.

20:27.191 --> 20:29.158
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:29.297 --> 20:30.884
What you're talking
about is, what,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.576
some kind of time machine?

20:32.714 --> 20:34.302
Kind of, but it's
just for your mind.

20:34.440 --> 20:38.029
It's not for your body. I'm
not explaining this well.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.548
Okay, so-
Are you sure they

20:39.686 --> 20:41.032
weren't just giving
you some psychedelics?

20:41.170 --> 20:43.311
No, man.

20:45.796 --> 20:47.315
Okay, shit. Okay.

20:51.491 --> 20:53.424
Well, thank you.

20:53.562 --> 20:54.701
Are you sure you have the money?

20:54.839 --> 20:55.806
Yeah, man.

20:57.532 --> 20:59.879
All right, then I owe you.

21:00.017 --> 21:01.156
No, and there's more.

21:01.294 --> 21:04.884
So before I have left,
they gave me a job.

21:05.022 --> 21:05.885
It's a really good job.

21:06.023 --> 21:07.990
It pays really well, and Matty,

21:08.128 --> 21:10.752
we're finally gonna get you
the treatment that you need.

21:10.890 --> 21:12.823
I am getting the
treatment I need.

21:12.961 --> 21:15.412
Fuck that, the treatment
that you deserve.

21:15.550 --> 21:20.140
You and me were gonna
beat this thing together.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.142
You're not lying?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.593
No. I really believe that.

22:02.459 --> 22:06.601
♪ Little Miss Small Town ♪

22:06.739 --> 22:11.433
♪ She went way down south ♪

22:11.571 --> 22:16.542
♪ She's never gonna come back ♪

22:17.508 --> 22:20.856
♪ Little Miss Small Town ♪

22:20.994 --> 22:25.930
♪ She went way down ♪

22:26.897 --> 22:28.277
♪ She never gonna come back ♪

22:28.416 --> 22:31.384
All we're asking for is
a little more transparency.

22:31.522 --> 22:34.145
You have to understand.
We don't know your name.

22:34.283 --> 22:35.802
We can't see your face.

22:35.940 --> 22:38.149
We've discussed it and believe
you should consult the board

22:38.287 --> 22:40.255
for any future
trades of this size.

22:40.393 --> 22:41.463
Is that right?

22:41.601 --> 22:44.570
You seem a bit unpredictable.

22:44.708 --> 22:48.297
Unpredictable,
really. That's cute.

22:48.436 --> 22:49.747
Tell me, how much money
has your firm cleared

22:49.885 --> 22:51.473
in the past six months
thanks to the organization?

22:51.611 --> 22:54.925
Look, we're not questioning
your value to the company.

22:55.063 --> 22:58.100
There is nothing
unpredictable about what I do.

22:58.238 --> 22:59.654
Markets change.

22:59.792 --> 23:02.450
You keep trading like this
and you'll eventually lose.

23:02.588 --> 23:06.730
The world is unpredictable.
People are unpredictable.

23:06.868 --> 23:10.319
On the contrary,
people are the product,

23:12.045 --> 23:14.979
and they're a product
that should be controlled.

23:15.117 --> 23:18.466
Stick with me and
reap the benefits,

23:18.604 --> 23:22.159
or else we can part ways
right here right now.

23:22.297 --> 23:26.197
No, no, that won't
be necessary. Carry on.

23:30.305 --> 23:31.617
You requested
to speak with me.

23:31.755 --> 23:35.241
Yes. I have a job
for our little friend.

23:36.725 --> 23:39.832
I thought he was clear he
no longer wished to cooperate.

23:39.970 --> 23:42.041
Yes, well, you and I both
know what happens to people

23:42.179 --> 23:44.526
who don't cooperate
with the organization.

23:44.664 --> 23:46.908
Let's make sure he
gets that message.

23:47.046 --> 23:49.738
I'll do my
best, but to be honest,

23:49.876 --> 23:52.672
the man is a bit of an idiot.

23:52.810 --> 23:55.434
That man is key to everything.

24:13.003 --> 24:14.418
Hello?

24:14.556 --> 24:15.177
I see
you're enjoying the company

24:15.315 --> 24:16.006
of your new friends.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.736
Don't worry, you're
safe, for now.

24:23.254 --> 24:26.085
Well, I have
another job for you.

24:26.223 --> 24:28.881
Saying no isn't
really an option.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.305
No!

25:10.992 --> 25:13.615
How did they get our
names? Our addresses?

25:13.753 --> 25:15.962
You said we were good.
I don't know.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.690
And what are we supposed to
do? You got rid of it, right?

25:19.828 --> 25:24.419
Yeah. I mean, could just
ignore 'em, call their bluff.

25:25.593 --> 25:27.595
Did you already
forget what happened?

25:27.733 --> 25:28.803
Wait, when you came to
meet with this shit,

25:28.941 --> 25:30.114
you told me that these jobs

25:30.252 --> 25:33.014
were gonna be low
risk, high reward.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.018
I think about it every day.

25:37.156 --> 25:39.261
You think that I don't
feel the same way as you?

25:39.399 --> 25:42.748
No, you don't 'cause
it wasn't your fault.

25:42.886 --> 25:44.681
It never should've
come to that.

25:44.819 --> 25:47.097
We weren't prepared for an
ambush, and that's on me.

25:47.235 --> 25:50.272
Regardless, I trusted you then,
and I still trust you now.

25:50.410 --> 25:52.516
I mean, you trust me don't you?

25:52.654 --> 25:54.656
Honestly, no, I don't.

25:56.106 --> 26:00.006
Well, I guess that's
why we never worked out.

26:00.144 --> 26:02.181
Worked out? What?

26:02.319 --> 26:06.081
New Hampshire,
baby, two years ago.

26:06.219 --> 26:08.428
That was a long time ago.

26:12.363 --> 26:15.781
Did you actually get rid
of it like we talked about?

26:15.919 --> 26:19.370
Yeah. What's with the
new decals on the van?

26:19.508 --> 26:21.614
Starting my own
security company.

26:21.752 --> 26:25.238
- Yeah, that sounds fun.
- Yeah, it's not.

26:29.657 --> 26:32.418
Why aren't we already dead?

26:38.217 --> 26:42.566
You motherfucker. You
still have the Z, don't you?

26:49.711 --> 26:51.713
And you wonder why
I don't trust you.

26:51.851 --> 26:53.922
Fine, but I'm not using.

26:54.060 --> 26:55.441
Lee, we
talked about this.

26:55.579 --> 26:56.649
After what happened to Martin,

26:56.787 --> 26:58.168
we both agreed that
this had to end.

26:58.306 --> 26:59.618
Yes, but we also both
agreed the less you know,

26:59.756 --> 27:00.653
the better.

27:00.791 --> 27:02.034
The rules-
Oh my God!

27:02.172 --> 27:04.243
I know, the rules. Just save it.

27:04.381 --> 27:05.762
Okay, but in my defense,

27:05.900 --> 27:07.902
the organization is gonna kill
us if we don't do this job,

27:08.040 --> 27:09.524
so you're welcome.

27:14.425 --> 27:17.049
14 account
numbers? It's a lot.

27:18.706 --> 27:21.260
It's also a big price tag.

27:21.398 --> 27:24.263
Look, one last job
and we're done.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.473
- Gonna need a new photog.
- I'll handle it.

27:27.611 --> 27:31.788
You can barely handle
yourself. What's your plan?

27:32.892 --> 27:34.963
I'm gonna go see Danny.

27:36.378 --> 27:37.725
Okay. Whatever.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.831
If we're gonna do this, I
need to start planning now,

27:40.969 --> 27:43.316
so just make it happen.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.628
Take a shower.

28:21.769 --> 28:23.391
Not today.

28:23.529 --> 28:26.566
Cici, it is good to see you.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.707
What do you want, Lee?

28:28.845 --> 28:31.951
I just came by to say hello,
see how you were doing.

28:32.089 --> 28:34.574
Just fine until you showed up.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.025
- Where's Danny?
- He's busy.

28:39.856 --> 28:40.960
Two seconds.

28:54.249 --> 28:55.181
We'll see what's up.

28:55.319 --> 28:56.286
- Good, baby?
- Yep.

28:56.424 --> 28:58.944
- All right.
- All right, right on.

29:00.221 --> 29:01.325
Thought I smelled
some shit up in here.

29:01.463 --> 29:05.847
Danny.
How you doing, man?

29:05.985 --> 29:07.124
Man, you better tell me

29:07.262 --> 29:08.505
what the fuck you're
doing in here, man.

29:08.643 --> 29:09.989
I'm just coming by to say hi.

29:10.127 --> 29:12.681
Your ass better not
be here making no bets.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.890
I wouldn't dream of it.

29:14.028 --> 29:14.822
Damn right you
wouldn't dream of it.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.099
You still owe me, motherfucker.

29:16.237 --> 29:19.412
That is exactly
what I'm going here.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.483
Paying you back, baby.

29:28.525 --> 29:29.802
I guess it's a start, huh?

29:29.940 --> 29:33.081
How you been?

29:33.219 --> 29:35.981
I'm fussing. I bought
a boat last summer, huh?

29:36.119 --> 29:37.396
Yeah?

29:37.534 --> 29:39.191
Thought I might like
fishing. Turns out I don't.

29:39.329 --> 29:41.365
Know anybody looking to buy?
Sorry.

29:41.503 --> 29:43.264
Ah, it's all right.

29:44.506 --> 29:47.820
- I need a favor.
- Of course you do.

29:47.958 --> 29:50.202
Can you stop being
such a sourpuss?

29:50.340 --> 29:53.067
Sourpuss? Let me
explain something to you.

29:53.205 --> 29:56.725
You spent four years
coming in here making bets,

29:56.864 --> 29:58.313
taking my fucking money,

29:58.451 --> 30:00.937
only for me to find out you've
been using that Z bullshit.

30:01.075 --> 30:02.835
Danny, that was the old me.

30:02.973 --> 30:04.457
Those days is gone.
You know what I mean?

30:04.595 --> 30:07.736
It's all over. It's a
brand new Lee, right?

30:07.875 --> 30:09.911
You still live in that RV
that you won off Simpson?

30:10.049 --> 30:12.362
Yeah.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.571
How about that Mercedes
that you won off Tanner?

30:14.709 --> 30:17.470
You still rolling
around in that?

30:17.608 --> 30:20.473
Okay, yeah. Not a
fucking thing changed.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.821
You're a son of a
bitch, you know that?

30:22.959 --> 30:25.444
And this money, where's
this coming from, huh?

30:25.582 --> 30:26.963
Oh, you spend your days working

30:27.101 --> 30:30.863
as a substitute teacher
making it the honest way?

30:31.001 --> 30:33.555
No, I ain't think so.

30:33.693 --> 30:35.764
Your ass is still using, Lee,

30:35.903 --> 30:37.318
which is why I can
trust you about

30:37.456 --> 30:40.183
as far as I can toss you.

30:40.321 --> 30:43.186
What do you want, man?
I need a photog.

30:43.324 --> 30:46.706
Okay. What the fuck
happened to Martin?

30:47.673 --> 30:48.743
He retired.

30:51.194 --> 30:53.713
I'm sorry to hear that. Okay?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.474
But that right there,
that's the bullshit. Okay?

30:55.612 --> 30:58.201
That's why you need
to stop. All right?

30:58.339 --> 31:02.861
That's what happens when
you start fucking with time!

31:02.999 --> 31:05.035
As long as you got these pills,

31:05.173 --> 31:06.726
you'll never be
able to walk away.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.107
Once an addict,
always an addict.

31:08.245 --> 31:10.178
Ain't they right, what they say?

31:10.316 --> 31:15.183
You two are bookies. You make
your living off of addicts.

31:17.876 --> 31:22.156
- That's fair enough.
- I got a job. It's a big one.

31:24.158 --> 31:25.745
You two help me out,

31:25.884 --> 31:29.128
I'll pay you back
double what I owe you.

31:35.445 --> 31:39.794
You're lucky somebody
loves you. Tell you what.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.865
Yeah, I do know someone.

31:42.003 --> 31:45.006
Old Theo from the racino
came in the other day,

31:45.144 --> 31:47.284
talking about some lady
he had to kick out.

31:47.422 --> 31:49.493
Said she was the best
counter he ever seen.

31:52.462 --> 31:54.050
Spends her days on
campus collecting money

31:54.188 --> 31:55.465
from all the rich college kids,

31:55.603 --> 31:58.606
just taking all
their tests and shit.

32:00.746 --> 32:02.851
♪ Come on, whoo ♪

32:02.990 --> 32:04.129
♪ Yeah ♪

32:04.267 --> 32:07.546
Yeah, she's
a tough little thing.

32:09.444 --> 32:13.379
♪ Come on, whoo ♪

32:13.517 --> 32:16.106
♪ Come on, whoo ♪

32:16.244 --> 32:18.039
And her nights, yeah.

32:18.177 --> 32:20.524
She spends those at
the casino on Broadway.

32:22.906 --> 32:25.115
She set up the table
right here in this bar.

32:25.253 --> 32:27.669
Chances are she'll be
here later on tonight,

32:27.807 --> 32:29.637
way past
my bedtime though.

32:59.667 --> 33:02.911
Saw you on campus and
now here. What do you want?

33:03.050 --> 33:04.327
I don't think you're
a student, are you?

33:04.465 --> 33:05.949
I might be. You
here to blackmail me?

33:06.087 --> 33:08.572
Not quite. I do have
a proposal for you.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.333
Also, you know you don't
need a photographic memory

33:10.471 --> 33:13.129
to count cards, right?
Doesn't hurt.

33:13.267 --> 33:15.269
You got a history
of drug abuse?

33:15.407 --> 33:17.236
What? No.

33:17.374 --> 33:19.894
Good. Don't take it.

33:20.032 --> 33:23.070
But I usually love taking
pills from strange men at bars.

33:23.208 --> 33:25.486
It's called Z
Plus. Look it up.

33:25.624 --> 33:26.797
If you're interested,
meet me tomorrow,

33:26.935 --> 33:28.523
Jenning's Landing, 8:00 AM.

33:46.748 --> 33:48.474
What's up, everyone.
Welcome back to the channel.

33:48.612 --> 33:49.958
First things first,

33:50.097 --> 33:51.650
I wanna remind you to like,
comment, and subscribe.

33:51.788 --> 33:52.892
If you haven't already,

33:53.031 --> 33:54.342
make sure you hit that
little notification bell

33:54.480 --> 33:55.654
at the bottom so you
never miss another video.

33:55.792 --> 33:57.000
Let's just dive right in.

33:57.138 --> 33:59.037
A question popped
into my feed today

33:59.175 --> 34:02.316
about a Reddit post detailing
a so-called time travel pill.

34:02.454 --> 34:04.663
I took a look and, of course,
met it with heavy skepticism.

34:04.801 --> 34:07.010
But after a little bit of
research, I'm not so sure.

34:07.148 --> 34:08.632
To really understand
where all this comes from,

34:08.770 --> 34:10.082
we're gonna have to go
back a couple of years

34:10.220 --> 34:12.291
and talk about a man
named Dr. Jay Tupple.

34:12.429 --> 34:14.431
He was a neurophysicist
who died in 2018,

34:14.569 --> 34:16.226
or so they say, but
more on that later.

34:16.364 --> 34:19.298
His studies on the concept
of consciousness time trading

34:19.436 --> 34:20.851
were considered
controversial due

34:20.989 --> 34:22.784
to his use of human
test subjects.

34:22.922 --> 34:24.683
Now the serum,
which was called Z,

34:24.821 --> 34:26.581
reportedly made
the subjects crazy.

34:26.719 --> 34:29.550
Later, it was advanced
into its current pill form

34:29.688 --> 34:30.896
called Z Plus.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.485
Now that was before his
disappearance in 2019

34:33.623 --> 34:36.074
after the Russian mob reportedly
raided his laboratory.

34:36.212 --> 34:37.627
The police never found his body,

34:37.765 --> 34:39.111
and they've since
declared him dead.

34:39.249 --> 34:42.149
But this wouldn't be the
first time Dr. Tupple

34:42.287 --> 34:43.736
brought on this
type of controversy.

34:43.874 --> 34:45.083
See, two years earlier,

34:45.221 --> 34:46.912
he was declared dead
after being involved

34:47.050 --> 34:48.776
in the rescue of
a missing child,

34:48.914 --> 34:51.123
only to turn up six
months later unharmed.

34:51.261 --> 34:53.608
See, this has led several
people to theorize

34:53.746 --> 34:57.612
that Dr. Tupple is in fact
alive and is on the run

34:57.750 --> 34:59.718
and is using the Z
Plus to stay ahead

34:59.856 --> 35:01.202
of those that are
looking for him.

35:01.340 --> 35:04.240
The pill is rumored to be
able to change the order

35:04.378 --> 35:07.588
in which our minds
perceive time and events.

35:07.726 --> 35:10.142
But this is where the facts
get a little bit less certain.

35:13.421 --> 35:14.733
Yeah, I know.

35:18.978 --> 35:21.188
We'll get him, don't worry.

35:35.029 --> 35:36.789
What do we have here?

35:38.515 --> 35:40.552
I think this
one's over the edge, boss.

35:40.690 --> 35:45.143
Stop! How many times
do I have to tell you?

35:45.281 --> 35:46.834
I don't wanna see their faces.

35:46.972 --> 35:48.111
You want
me to put it back on?

35:48.249 --> 35:51.666
No, cut him loose.
Wait in the car.

36:00.917 --> 36:03.782
Tell me, what seems
to be the matter?

36:03.920 --> 36:06.992
Nothing, nothing,
nothing at all.

36:07.130 --> 36:11.652
I made a stupid joke, and
George took me too seriously.

36:13.861 --> 36:17.209
Everything's good.
Sorry to hear that.

36:17.347 --> 36:21.179
If there is something
wrong, you could tell me.

36:26.529 --> 36:27.875
I'm trying to remember

36:28.013 --> 36:32.051
what happened even fucking
two minutes ago, and I can't.

36:33.225 --> 36:36.677
It's like two sides,
two competing memories.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.785
I'm so sorry.

36:48.309 --> 36:51.347
Look, man, I can't
take it anymore.

36:55.696 --> 36:58.906
Like cars crashing
together in my brain.

36:59.044 --> 37:01.149
I don't know what's
real anymore.

37:01.288 --> 37:03.531
I see. I have to ask you.

37:06.465 --> 37:10.055
Did you or did you not
do what I asked of you?

37:10.193 --> 37:13.576
I did, I did.

37:17.407 --> 37:20.755
Put the sack back
on your head, please.

37:45.608 --> 37:48.611
I need them to keep
things straight.

37:48.749 --> 37:52.511
Get some more Z serum
from one of the new guys.

38:08.113 --> 38:12.428
All right, what is this
really? Time travel pills?

38:13.877 --> 38:15.085
I mean, what are you trying
to sell me magic beans?

38:15.223 --> 38:17.295
You trying to get me to
pass 'em off to others?

38:17.433 --> 38:19.987
I'm trying to offer you a job.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.713
No, thank you.

38:21.851 --> 38:23.715
I did a little
research on you.

38:23.853 --> 38:27.201
You're in debt and
with the wrong people.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.168
I've been there
before. It sucks.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.518
I'm guessing now you're looking
for a way to start over.

38:33.656 --> 38:34.829
Okay, I'm gonna
humor you for a second

38:34.967 --> 38:36.797
and believe that this is real.

38:36.935 --> 38:38.419
Explain.

38:38.557 --> 38:42.458
On the paper's what
I'm offering for the job.

38:45.253 --> 38:49.465
Let's get coffee.

38:56.161 --> 38:57.473
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

38:57.611 --> 38:59.889
I mean, there are many
ways to get exposure.

39:00.027 --> 39:02.236
Well, that's what everyone
gets wrong, right?

39:02.374 --> 39:03.617
I mean, if everyone
was getting right,

39:03.755 --> 39:05.515
they we'd know about it, right?

39:05.653 --> 39:08.276
Okay.
Right, yeah.

39:08.415 --> 39:10.244
Okay. Well, you know, yeah,
I'm just leaving right now.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.556
Okay. I gotta go.

39:23.602 --> 39:27.606
Okay, consciousness
time trading. Just
walk me through it.

39:27.744 --> 39:28.435
Okay.

39:30.195 --> 39:32.231
Hey, miss. How you doing?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.716
You got a pen on you?

39:38.445 --> 39:39.273
Thanks.

39:40.447 --> 39:43.381
Okay, so we think of
time in a straight line,

39:43.519 --> 39:45.279
one road leading
from A to B, right?

39:45.417 --> 39:46.970
Let's start to think
of it as a map.

39:47.108 --> 39:51.389
The locations stay the same,
but the order and the route

39:51.527 --> 39:54.253
in which you hit
them can change.

40:00.121 --> 40:01.640
That's a pretty
high-tech case.

40:01.778 --> 40:03.504
Yeah. These pills are no joke.

40:03.642 --> 40:05.472
The wrong person tries
to open up this case,

40:05.610 --> 40:06.783
and it will burn their eye out.

40:06.921 --> 40:09.855
Jesus. And you just
gave me one in a bar?

40:09.993 --> 40:11.961
Relax. This is a fake.

40:13.963 --> 40:16.414
So do you have plans
tomorrow morning?

40:16.552 --> 40:17.656
Oh, yeah. I have a gig.

40:17.794 --> 40:19.762
I'm taking a midterm
for a trust fund baby.

40:22.040 --> 40:24.594
It's 9:00 AM, give or take.

40:24.732 --> 40:27.148
Let's say hypothetically
that you take the pill,

40:27.286 --> 40:29.634
the Z Plus, right now.

40:29.772 --> 40:31.981
When you take the pill,
you're gonna close your eyes.

40:32.119 --> 40:34.362
When you open them,
they're gonna be purple.

40:34.501 --> 40:36.813
That means you're
jumping forward.

40:36.951 --> 40:37.883
You should be right on campus,

40:38.021 --> 40:39.782
getting ready to take that test.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.611
Then they'll definitely
know something's up,

40:41.749 --> 40:44.062
but if I don't do well,
I'm gonna fucking fail,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.340
and my parents are
gonna fucking kill me.

40:46.478 --> 40:49.101
Wait, what happens to tomorrow
me when I'm in their body?

40:49.239 --> 40:51.863
Here's where it gets a
little more complicated.

40:52.001 --> 40:53.623
Let's go back to just
before your eyes went purple

40:53.761 --> 40:55.004
on campus.

40:55.142 --> 40:56.730
I really have
to do well on this

40:56.868 --> 40:59.353
because my parents are paying
full tuition, as you know.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.389
While you're jumping
forward from the day before,

41:01.528 --> 41:05.152
your tomorrow self is gonna
wake up in your body right now.

41:05.290 --> 41:06.981
Your eyes are gonna be green.

41:07.119 --> 41:08.845
That means you're
jumping backward.

41:08.983 --> 41:10.985
For the next hour,
tomorrow Sophia's gonna get

41:11.123 --> 41:14.023
to hang out here with
me at the coffee shop

41:14.161 --> 41:16.819
while today Sophia-
Will be in my body tomorrow.

41:16.957 --> 41:20.685
When the time runs
out, you'll switch back.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.999
That's how it works, basically.

41:25.137 --> 41:29.038
- Basically.
- Basically.

41:29.176 --> 41:32.248
The stuff was originally
concocted as a serum, Z,

41:32.386 --> 41:35.216
much more unpredictable,
much more dangerous.

41:35.354 --> 41:37.184
Eventually, it was refined
into the pill form,

41:37.322 --> 41:39.980
Z Plus, with a bit more control.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.846
But can't any little thing
change everything though,

41:43.984 --> 41:45.364
like the butterfly effect?

41:45.503 --> 41:48.402
Yeah. That's why we limit
the amount of variables.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.404
The less we know, the better.

41:50.542 --> 41:51.854
We don't know what
we're trying to steal,

41:51.992 --> 41:54.408
it makes it harder for
us to screw it all up.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.065
The team is made up
of three components,

41:56.203 --> 41:58.032
the sitter, the
tech, and the photog.

41:58.170 --> 41:59.620
The sitter, me, is in
charge of making sure

41:59.758 --> 42:01.519
that we don't lose our
minds by limiting the amount

42:01.657 --> 42:03.728
of variable, such
as the moving truck,

42:03.866 --> 42:05.177
making sure that we
have limited knowledge

42:05.315 --> 42:06.731
and administering the Z.

42:06.869 --> 42:08.526
The tech's job is to
plan the actual steal

42:08.664 --> 42:10.424
and manage the logistics.

42:10.562 --> 42:11.701
Lucky for us, we try
to steal information

42:11.839 --> 42:14.221
that has no significant
value on the day of

42:14.359 --> 42:17.431
but means a whole hell of a
lot if obtained the day before.

42:17.569 --> 42:20.227
Low risk, low
security, high reward.

42:20.365 --> 42:22.574
I see took the
decals off the van.

42:22.712 --> 42:25.197
How's it going?
You must be Sophia.

42:25.335 --> 42:28.062
I'm Finn.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.995
And I'm the new
photog, I'm assuming.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.445
Yep.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.102
We get you in. You remember
it when you come back.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.793
Do I wanna know what
happened to the other one?

42:34.931 --> 42:36.657
Before you
agree to anything,

42:36.795 --> 42:39.315
you should be aware that there
are certain dangers involved

42:39.453 --> 42:40.903
in what we do.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.939
When you steal from people,
sometimes they fight back,

42:43.077 --> 42:45.666
but above all else,
we follow my rules.

42:45.804 --> 42:48.151
We get in, we get
out, and we get paid,

42:48.289 --> 42:50.706
and then we're all on our own.

42:52.535 --> 42:53.950
What do you think?

42:57.057 --> 42:59.577
So what are we stealing?

42:59.715 --> 43:01.130
Finn.

43:01.268 --> 43:03.719
I have bad news
and I have good news.

43:03.857 --> 43:06.480
Our target is 14 account
numbers, 10 digits each,

43:06.618 --> 43:10.104
to be published and stored
in their records Thursday.

43:10.242 --> 43:12.555
I've omitted the name of the
company for obvious reasons.

43:12.693 --> 43:16.421
- 14 account numbers?
- It's a lot. You okay?

43:17.595 --> 43:18.768
Yeah.

43:18.906 --> 43:20.114
So the location is
a nightmare for us.

43:20.252 --> 43:21.288
Cameras everywhere at all times,

43:21.426 --> 43:22.738
security at every entrance.

43:22.876 --> 43:24.256
It's a non-starter and
with such a short runway

43:24.394 --> 43:27.466
for planning, even more of
a zero-chance operation.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.158
You said there was good news.

43:29.296 --> 43:30.435
Simon Willoughby.

43:30.573 --> 43:32.161
Technically, on their
staff he's a programmer,

43:32.299 --> 43:34.646
but in reality, he's a
go between for any large

43:34.784 --> 43:37.028
and less than ethical
deals for the company.

43:37.166 --> 43:38.650
Basically, he's the fall guy.

43:38.788 --> 43:41.411
No, no, no, no. I don't
need to know any of that, no.

43:41.549 --> 43:43.862
Just send me over the
details. I'll take care of it.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.346
What's good for
us is that he works

43:45.484 --> 43:47.659
from his fancy upstate
chalet this time of year.

43:47.797 --> 43:49.488
Yeah, So I'm heading
north of the week.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.629
Yeah, yeah, you gotta
come check this place out

43:51.767 --> 43:53.147
and then we'll hang
out in the jacuzz.

43:53.285 --> 43:55.149
It'll be a great time.
Yeah, no, no, I'm good.

43:55.287 --> 43:56.979
Okay, yep. I'll give
you a quick call later.

43:57.117 --> 43:58.325
Bye bye.

43:58.463 --> 44:00.603
Place is nice, but
it's less than secure.

44:00.741 --> 44:01.846
Does seem, though, as of late,

44:01.984 --> 44:03.364
he's been going
through some stuff.

44:06.505 --> 44:08.162
It's easy to believe

44:08.300 --> 44:09.992
that just because
you're not currently

44:10.130 --> 44:14.272
where you want to be
spiritually and physically,

44:14.410 --> 44:19.104
you mustn't ever forget
that tomorrow is a new day,

44:19.242 --> 44:21.037
a day to be a new you.

44:22.245 --> 44:24.731
Repeat after me.
I am good enough.

44:27.147 --> 44:28.355
I am good enough.

44:28.493 --> 44:31.841
- I am worth it.
- I am worth it.

44:31.979 --> 44:34.533
- I have value.
- I have value.

44:36.121 --> 44:40.229
I am a good person.

44:40.367 --> 44:41.471
I am a good person.

44:41.609 --> 44:44.129
New
call from Todd Hamilton.

44:44.267 --> 44:46.891
Hey you! What can I do for ya?

44:47.029 --> 44:49.031
I'll have the numbers on
his computer Thursday morning.

44:49.169 --> 44:51.205
That gives us a very small
window of time to obtain them

44:51.343 --> 44:53.587
and get them to the organization
before our deadline.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.588
Any questions?

45:18.267 --> 45:20.718
Okay. So you know the plan.

45:20.856 --> 45:22.064
Unless shit hits the fan,

45:22.202 --> 45:23.824
we should wake up at location B,

45:23.962 --> 45:25.412
at which we'll infiltrate
through the pipeline

45:25.550 --> 45:26.896
to the main property.

45:27.034 --> 45:28.380
Then-

45:28.518 --> 45:29.761
Then it's a matter of
Simon chasing the delivery.

45:29.899 --> 45:31.970
The mail usually comes
around 9:30 or 10.

45:32.108 --> 45:34.421
Then we get in, we get
the target off the computer,

45:34.559 --> 45:36.906
and we get out undetected, copy?

45:37.044 --> 45:37.873
Copy.

45:39.944 --> 45:41.428
Word of advice, Sophia.

45:41.566 --> 45:46.295
The first time can feel a
little jolting. Don't fight it.

46:04.900 --> 46:05.866
How'd it go?

46:10.146 --> 46:13.529
You get used to it.

46:13.667 --> 46:15.462
Quarter mile into those
woods is the drainage pipe.

46:15.600 --> 46:18.637
That'll take you to
Simon's backyard.

46:21.261 --> 46:22.089
You good?

46:24.782 --> 46:27.854
I'm good.

46:28.751 --> 46:29.614
See you soon.

47:13.934 --> 47:15.142
All right, Lee,
give me an update.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.868
We're good. We're
almost at the spot.

47:31.055 --> 47:32.539
That's a go, Finn.

48:14.098 --> 48:14.892
Hello?

48:17.066 --> 48:17.895
Hi.

48:22.623 --> 48:23.452
Hello!

48:24.902 --> 48:26.558
You're up, you two.

48:37.259 --> 48:39.744
Where are you going?

48:42.747 --> 48:44.714
- Finn, it's locked.
- Can you pick it?

48:44.852 --> 48:46.924
Yeah, sure. Stand back.

48:50.134 --> 48:53.896
I said pick
it, not kick it, Lee.

49:00.247 --> 49:01.214
Well, how'd you
learn to do that?

49:01.352 --> 49:02.940
Don't wanna know.

49:07.703 --> 49:09.325
Come on, come on.

49:09.463 --> 49:11.327
The fuck. Right here!

49:17.609 --> 49:19.715
The email's not here.

49:19.853 --> 49:22.062
- Finn, the email's not there.
- Should've been there at 10.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.581
Well, it's not.

49:23.719 --> 49:25.065
Well, if it's not
there, it's coming soon.

49:25.203 --> 49:28.517
Well, we don't really have
that kind of time, Finn.

49:28.655 --> 49:30.829
- Wait, it just came in.
- Let's go.

49:30.968 --> 49:33.660
Well, give me
a couple seconds.

49:39.942 --> 49:42.634
All right, time's
up. Let's go.

49:48.502 --> 49:50.125
Okay, got it.

49:50.263 --> 49:53.162
- Lee, we got company.
- Who?

49:54.577 --> 49:57.201
Yeah, yeah, right here.
Bring it back, yeah.

49:57.339 --> 49:58.616
Drive away and then come back.

49:58.754 --> 50:00.859
Right, bring it
right fucking here.

50:04.449 --> 50:05.278
Shit!

50:10.869 --> 50:13.872
What do we do?
Go, minimal impact.

50:19.361 --> 50:22.812
Get off of me. Get
the fuck off of me!

50:25.263 --> 50:28.059
Whatever it is, it's another
deal. I can get you details.

50:28.197 --> 50:29.336
We're going.

50:30.924 --> 50:31.752
Hi.

50:31.890 --> 50:32.960
I don't know who you are,

50:33.099 --> 50:34.617
but I can fix whatever
the fuck it is.

50:34.755 --> 50:37.034
Sh, I know. Are you alone?

50:38.863 --> 50:40.416
This is my place. I'm alone.

50:40.554 --> 50:42.763
I'm always fucking alone. Okay?

50:47.113 --> 50:49.598
- Kill him.
- Please, please don't!

50:49.736 --> 50:50.909
I can get you whatever you want.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.394
I can do whatever you want.

50:52.532 --> 50:54.948
I know some very, very
powerful, very rich people.

50:55.086 --> 50:58.469
I can make whatever it is
that you want to have happen.

50:58.607 --> 51:00.816
I'm just trying to actually
be a little bit better

51:00.954 --> 51:02.369
of a person.

51:02.507 --> 51:06.097
I'm just not quite there yet.
I can't die right now. Okay?

51:06.235 --> 51:07.064
Please.

51:20.077 --> 51:23.252
See. I knew you weren't alone.

51:34.401 --> 51:35.506
Go with her.

51:42.478 --> 51:45.102
Who are you, you son of a bitch?

52:04.776 --> 52:05.881
Who are you?

52:06.813 --> 52:09.471
Hi, Lee.

52:09.609 --> 52:10.713
Answer!

52:15.132 --> 52:15.960
Answer!

52:32.632 --> 52:33.460
Hey.

52:40.847 --> 52:42.435
What happened to
minimal impact, Lee?

52:42.573 --> 52:43.988
What the fuck is going on?

52:44.126 --> 52:46.232
Lee, where are
you? Lee, answer me.

52:50.822 --> 52:51.616
Fucker.

52:54.723 --> 52:56.483
I'm here. I'm here.

52:56.621 --> 52:58.175
Find a safe spot off the road.

52:58.313 --> 53:00.246
Drive some. I'll meet you there.

53:00.384 --> 53:01.350
I think we're being followed.

53:01.488 --> 53:02.731
- You think?
- No shit!

53:02.869 --> 53:04.215
- No, different follower.
- You know what?

53:04.353 --> 53:06.321
You can just pull over
right here and I'll get out.

53:06.459 --> 53:08.702
Thank you so much for saving
me. I really do appreciate it.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.291
Lee, were those the same
guys that killed Martin?

53:11.429 --> 53:13.569
- I don't know!
- Who's Martin?

53:22.233 --> 53:23.200
- Get out.
- What do you mean get out?

53:23.338 --> 53:24.166
Get out!

53:25.409 --> 53:27.204
- 15 seconds.
- We'll be back tomorrow.

53:27.342 --> 53:29.102
- Tomorrow?
- 11 Seconds.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.035
- What?
- Seven seconds.

53:31.173 --> 53:32.416
- Until what?
- Ready?

53:44.186 --> 53:44.945
Where are we?

53:45.083 --> 53:46.947
Why are we at your place, Lee?

53:47.085 --> 53:48.777
- I don't know.
- Why aren't we in the truck?

53:48.915 --> 53:49.812
Because we clearly
left the truck

53:49.950 --> 53:51.814
after we jumped backwards.

53:51.952 --> 53:54.127
- Fuck! The Z's gone.
- What do you mean?

53:54.265 --> 53:56.854
I mean it's gone, everything.

53:59.201 --> 54:00.582
Okay. Let's recap.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.135
We were in the
truck and took a Z.

54:02.273 --> 54:04.793
Our tomorrow selves occupied
our bodies for the next hour.

54:04.931 --> 54:06.795
During that hour, they somehow
got us to your trailer,

54:06.933 --> 54:08.624
and the Z was stolen.

54:08.762 --> 54:10.005
Maybe the driver
brought us here

54:10.143 --> 54:11.903
and forced you to
hand over the Z.

54:12.041 --> 54:13.146
It wasn't the driver.

54:13.284 --> 54:14.872
We were being followed
since the beginning.

54:15.010 --> 54:16.770
- Yeah, no shit.
- No, there was another car.

54:16.908 --> 54:18.841
It looked like your car.

54:20.326 --> 54:22.017
Is someone gonna explain how
we got out of a moving truck?

54:22.155 --> 54:25.883
Yeah. How did we get
out of the truck, Lee?

54:28.368 --> 54:29.749
Jesus Christ. I knew it.

54:29.887 --> 54:30.819
There's an eye scanner in
the truck, isn't there?

54:30.957 --> 54:32.096
But the truck is moving?

54:32.234 --> 54:32.959
You have all these
rules that everyone has

54:33.097 --> 54:34.132
to follow except for you.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.651
It's for emergencies.

54:35.789 --> 54:37.515
Listen, we could've just
decided to come back here,

54:37.653 --> 54:40.207
hide Z from whoever it
is before they got to it.

54:40.346 --> 54:42.002
Okay. Where would you hide it?

54:42.140 --> 54:43.383
I don't know. It
could be anywhere.

54:43.521 --> 54:44.488
Like here?

54:46.110 --> 54:47.007
- Stop.
- What?

54:47.145 --> 54:48.664
- Don't look.
- Why?

54:48.802 --> 54:49.976
If you look and
it's not there,

54:50.114 --> 54:51.667
then we can't come back
tomorrow and hide it.

54:51.805 --> 54:53.462
- Schrodinger's cat.
- Whose cat?

54:53.600 --> 54:54.636
Schrodinger's cat.

54:54.774 --> 54:56.534
It's an idea about
paradoxes and realities.

54:56.672 --> 54:57.846
Say you have a box
with a cat in it

54:57.984 --> 54:59.537
and you don't know if
it's alive or dead.

54:59.675 --> 55:00.814
Before you look inside the box,

55:00.952 --> 55:02.264
it's actually both
alive and dead.

55:02.402 --> 55:04.473
Either reality could be true.

55:04.611 --> 55:05.854
Once you look inside
the box, though,

55:05.992 --> 55:09.375
we're committed to that version.

55:09.513 --> 55:12.688
So the Z is both behind the
panel and not behind the panel?

55:12.826 --> 55:15.104
Mm-hmm.

55:15.242 --> 55:19.177
- Okay, so what do we do?
- We stick to the plan.

55:19.316 --> 55:22.802
Tomorrow, we drive to
Simon's cabin, park the car.

55:22.940 --> 55:24.424
We jump backwards into
the truck, we come here,

55:24.562 --> 55:27.979
we hide the Z behind the
panel, wake up in the woods,

55:28.117 --> 55:33.053
deal with Simon, and then we
are having beers by dinner.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.746
- And what about the job?
- And your car?

55:35.884 --> 55:39.819
I'll figure it out.
Do you have the numbers?

55:39.957 --> 55:40.751
Yeah.

55:43.270 --> 55:47.067
Finn, may I please
have the keys to the van?

55:54.281 --> 55:56.042
Better get us paid.

55:57.906 --> 55:59.701
It is gonna be fine.

56:06.708 --> 56:08.917
Fuck!
It's gonna be fine.

56:34.183 --> 56:35.599
I'm sorry.

56:35.737 --> 56:39.637
The liquid sample you provided
to us is just very unstable.

56:39.775 --> 56:42.916
We're getting closer,
but it's not ready yet.

56:43.054 --> 56:44.849
Do you understand what
this is, Dr. Muller?

56:44.987 --> 56:48.163
This is spatial
temporal neuroscience,

56:48.301 --> 56:50.130
and it's extremely complicated.

56:50.268 --> 56:54.790
Wrong. This is a race,
a race for the future.

56:54.928 --> 56:57.793
Do you understand?
I do.

56:57.931 --> 56:58.656
Keep working.

57:05.249 --> 57:06.802
Is Danny here?

57:06.940 --> 57:07.976
He's out there
trying to find somebody

57:08.114 --> 57:10.081
to buy that stupid boat.

57:13.257 --> 57:14.603
Everything okay?

57:18.020 --> 57:19.332
Our brains have already
established a timeline

57:19.470 --> 57:21.817
in which we wake up at my place.

57:21.955 --> 57:23.198
So if we wake up anywhere else,

57:23.336 --> 57:24.820
our brains aren't gonna
know which timeline

57:24.958 --> 57:26.339
is the right one.

57:28.410 --> 57:30.274
I still don't
understand the blindfolds.

57:30.412 --> 57:32.103
It can be very
tempting to want

57:32.241 --> 57:34.830
to try and change your
past, even only for a day.

57:34.968 --> 57:36.522
If we don't know where
we are when we go back,

57:36.660 --> 57:38.385
it makes it a lot
tougher to change things

57:38.524 --> 57:41.699
than lose total
grip on our reality.

57:41.837 --> 57:43.874
This
shit's complicated.

57:44.012 --> 57:46.014
Now you're telling me.

57:46.152 --> 57:47.878
So be honest.

57:48.016 --> 57:49.845
When you get to the truck,

57:49.983 --> 57:54.125
do you, Lee Warner, really
not know where you are?

57:59.579 --> 58:00.822
You still in love with Finn?

58:03.825 --> 58:06.344
How's she doing?
She's good.

58:08.830 --> 58:11.384
I gotta finish closing.
You good to go home?

58:11.522 --> 58:15.871
- Yeah, I got Finn's van.
- What happened to your car?

58:17.010 --> 58:21.152
Honestly, I don't
know.

58:22.671 --> 58:27.400
Well, good luck tomorrow or
today or I don't fucking know.

58:49.871 --> 58:50.906
Hello, anybody?

58:52.839 --> 58:56.947
- Hi there.
- Whoa, shit.

58:57.085 --> 58:58.224
You scared me.

58:59.363 --> 59:00.191
Sorry.

59:02.055 --> 59:05.680
Would you like to join
me for another drink?

59:08.234 --> 59:10.547
I think the bar's closing.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.011
Maybe we can go
somewhere else,

59:27.149 --> 59:29.704
somewhere more private perhaps.

59:31.050 --> 59:32.189
Yeah, maybe.

59:36.434 --> 59:38.713
I see pain in your eyes, Lee.

59:45.133 --> 59:48.101
- I've had my eye on you.
- Okay!

59:48.239 --> 59:50.483
I have a secret.
Can I share it?

59:50.621 --> 59:52.002
Look, this is really great,

59:52.140 --> 59:55.453
but I think that you think
that I'm somebody else.

59:55.592 --> 59:58.146
Don't fight it, Lee.

59:59.941 --> 1:00:02.115
Fuck was that?

1:00:02.253 --> 1:00:04.462
Don't fight it, Lee.

1:00:22.446 --> 1:00:23.309
It's a
pleasure to finally talk

1:00:23.447 --> 1:00:25.207
to you, Mr. Warner.

1:00:25.345 --> 1:00:27.658
What is this?
What is going on?

1:00:27.796 --> 1:00:28.970
You've been injected

1:00:29.108 --> 1:00:30.350
with the consciousness
communications device.

1:00:30.488 --> 1:00:31.869
I just spoke with
my representative,

1:00:32.007 --> 1:00:33.181
and I would love
to discuss how you

1:00:33.319 --> 1:00:35.632
and I can improve our
working relationship.

1:00:35.770 --> 1:00:37.530
How about a fucking
phone call, man?

1:00:37.668 --> 1:00:40.878
Lee, I took the privilege of
looking at your profile here.

1:00:41.016 --> 1:00:42.673
Arrested seven times.

1:00:44.502 --> 1:00:48.368
Robbery, fraud. I mean,
the list goes on and on.

1:00:48.506 --> 1:00:50.647
I'm also reading here
that you've got one

1:00:50.785 --> 1:00:52.269
of your team members killed.

1:00:52.407 --> 1:00:56.514
Such a pity, but
nevertheless, you carry on.

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:59.379
You seem quite strong willed.

1:00:59.517 --> 1:01:03.038
I'm also strong willed.
Where's our money?

1:01:03.176 --> 1:01:05.903
Lee, the organization needs
your help, and quite frankly,

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:09.562
we had the organization do not
like to get our hands dirty.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:11.219
And it would be such
a terrible shame

1:01:11.357 --> 1:01:14.671
if something were to happen
to one of your people,

1:01:14.809 --> 1:01:16.327
again, that is.

1:01:18.019 --> 1:01:19.434
Look, Lee, let's not
have another death due

1:01:19.572 --> 1:01:22.195
to your pride, shall we?

1:01:22.333 --> 1:01:24.059
If you reconsider the
offer of helping us,

1:01:24.197 --> 1:01:27.891
you can find another microchip
in your left jacket pocket.

1:01:28.029 --> 1:01:29.927
You know what to do.

1:01:53.433 --> 1:01:54.262
Once we're back in the truck,

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:55.470
we'll have one hour to get out,

1:01:55.608 --> 1:01:56.989
take the van to my
place, and hide the Z.

1:01:57.127 --> 1:01:58.335
What
happens if we don't?

1:01:58.473 --> 1:02:00.337
- Nothing good.
- Lee, again,

1:02:00.475 --> 1:02:02.891
remind me how this is
supposed to get us paid.

1:02:03.029 --> 1:02:04.513
Five seconds.

1:02:04.651 --> 1:02:09.035
- I have a contingency plan.
- Of course you do.

1:02:09.173 --> 1:02:10.416
See you in the truck.

1:02:16.525 --> 1:02:17.354
Lee?

1:02:24.292 --> 1:02:26.294
Lee, the truck is moving.

1:02:31.506 --> 1:02:34.405
Guessing you don't
have one for us?

1:02:35.959 --> 1:02:39.169
Not gonna be needing
one. Stand back.

1:02:43.967 --> 1:02:47.315
- Now what are you gonna do?
- Improvise.

1:02:54.425 --> 1:02:56.117

Hey guys,

1:04:42.775 --> 1:04:44.432
we need to hide the Z and
leave everything else exactly

1:04:44.570 --> 1:04:45.882
how we found it.

1:04:47.676 --> 1:04:48.505
Got it.

1:04:50.748 --> 1:04:55.098
Wait. This was open yesterday.
Because we opened it.

1:05:05.625 --> 1:05:07.006
Oh no, no. Remember,
leave it off.

1:05:07.144 --> 1:05:09.802
That's how we found it when
we woke up here yesterday.

1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:12.356
Right, the fucking cabinet.

1:05:13.254 --> 1:05:14.220
Positions.

1:05:19.191 --> 1:05:21.434
How we doing for time?
Five minutes.

1:05:21.572 --> 1:05:22.608
And we were in
these spots, right?

1:05:22.746 --> 1:05:25.093
Yeah. I think I was over here.

1:05:25.231 --> 1:05:26.992
Something's not right.

1:05:27.130 --> 1:05:29.684
- We're ahead of schedule?
- I hope so.

1:05:39.901 --> 1:05:41.454
Shit! Everybody inside!

1:05:53.950 --> 1:05:56.849
I know you're in
there. Come out.

1:05:59.024 --> 1:06:01.233
You have something that I want.

1:06:01.371 --> 1:06:03.821
I was thinking perhaps
we can make a trade.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:06.824
I have something
that you may want.

1:06:14.729 --> 1:06:16.351
You have 10 seconds!

1:06:24.290 --> 1:06:26.189
10, nine, eight, seven,

1:06:28.777 --> 1:06:30.987
six, five, four, tres, dos!

1:06:33.368 --> 1:06:34.197
I'm here!

1:06:37.027 --> 1:06:38.684
There he is.

1:06:44.414 --> 1:06:45.346
Who are you?

1:06:46.554 --> 1:06:51.076
Those eyes. See, we're
not so different, Lee.

1:06:51.214 --> 1:06:52.939
I was just a few
years too early.

1:06:53.078 --> 1:06:54.596
What's your
experience right now?

1:06:54.734 --> 1:06:56.426
Think about
what that first batch

1:06:56.564 --> 1:07:01.189
of serum was like, your
own memories becoming lies.

1:07:01.327 --> 1:07:03.709
It's hard to describe.

1:07:03.847 --> 1:07:05.400
You become powerless.

1:07:05.538 --> 1:07:08.576
- You see, your mind is.
- Small.

1:07:10.164 --> 1:07:13.960
It's pretty quite
fascinating, isn't it?

1:07:14.099 --> 1:07:18.379
An entire galaxy of moments
living inside our minds.

1:07:19.863 --> 1:07:23.246
With that being said, I prefer
to live in the here and now.

1:07:23.384 --> 1:07:24.557
Whenever you wake up tomorrow,

1:07:24.695 --> 1:07:28.389
your friend here can
either be dead or alive,

1:07:30.218 --> 1:07:33.152
but you probably already
know what happens.

1:07:33.290 --> 1:07:37.605
As we both know, we can
always change things, right?

1:07:43.438 --> 1:07:46.372
- Now go.
- I'll see you soon, Lee.

1:08:01.629 --> 1:08:03.424
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1:08:07.462 --> 1:08:09.671
I'm-
Sorry, Finn. Time?

1:08:11.811 --> 1:08:13.537
30 seconds.

1:08:13.675 --> 1:08:14.883
I know the way
this is gonna sound,

1:08:15.021 --> 1:08:16.471
but I need you to go.
What?

1:08:16.609 --> 1:08:17.955
We're about to wake up here.

1:08:18.094 --> 1:08:20.993
If he's here when we do,
we're gonna lose total grip.

1:08:21.131 --> 1:08:22.098
I need you to go right now.

1:08:22.236 --> 1:08:23.271
- Okay, what the fuck?
- Sophia!

1:08:23.409 --> 1:08:26.067
- 15 seconds.
- Take it and go. Okay?

1:08:26.205 --> 1:08:27.310
You're welcome to follow us,

1:08:27.448 --> 1:08:28.518
but don't let us
know you're there.

1:08:28.656 --> 1:08:29.691
I'll see you at
this time tomorrow.

1:08:29.829 --> 1:08:31.141
- Five seconds.
- Positions.

1:08:36.146 --> 1:08:37.665
Three, two, one.

1:08:42.290 --> 1:08:46.984
So I'm gonna ask again. What
the fuck is going on, huh?

1:08:56.684 --> 1:08:57.995
I am so sorry.

1:08:59.721 --> 1:09:01.171
Okay. All right.

1:09:05.175 --> 1:09:07.246
Who's this?
I'm Sophia.

1:09:08.696 --> 1:09:12.044
- Nice to meet ya.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

1:09:27.818 --> 1:09:29.303
His name is Derrick Volkov.

1:09:29.441 --> 1:09:31.477
He's a Russian mobster
was, for some reason,

1:09:31.615 --> 1:09:34.480
hired to obtain the
full supply of Z Plus.

1:09:34.618 --> 1:09:35.757
He's hired mercenaries
to take the Z

1:09:35.895 --> 1:09:37.794
and jump so he doesn't have to.

1:09:37.932 --> 1:09:40.935
I'm confused. We saw you die.

1:09:41.073 --> 1:09:45.077
Not quite. I didn't make
it out the first time,

1:09:45.215 --> 1:09:46.182
I was told.

1:09:50.255 --> 1:09:52.636
They kept me just
barely alive long enough

1:09:52.774 --> 1:09:54.397
for them to undo it.

1:10:03.578 --> 1:10:04.993
They can fuck with
events on his behalf

1:10:05.131 --> 1:10:06.926
without him having to
know their identities.

1:10:07.064 --> 1:10:08.721
Then when they
start to go crazy,

1:10:08.859 --> 1:10:12.208
lose their grip on reality,
they're disposed of.

1:10:12.346 --> 1:10:16.142
- Do you know who hired him?
- I don't.

1:10:16.281 --> 1:10:19.767
I do. Derrick Volkov
is a client of mine.

1:10:21.217 --> 1:10:23.011
I've never met him until today.

1:10:23.149 --> 1:10:24.289
Go on.

1:10:24.427 --> 1:10:26.083
Untie me and tell
me what's going on,

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:29.535
and then yeah,
maybe I will go on.

1:10:31.710 --> 1:10:34.540
He's a client by name only.

1:10:34.678 --> 1:10:36.577
Actually, they have a very
large transaction scheduled

1:10:36.715 --> 1:10:38.268
for this week.
How big?

1:10:38.406 --> 1:10:39.787
Big, like 100 million.

1:10:39.925 --> 1:10:41.823
Derrick's selling over
the Z that we handed to him?

1:10:41.961 --> 1:10:43.273
What do you do exactly?

1:10:43.411 --> 1:10:45.275
I'm a programmer
for a crypto company.

1:10:45.413 --> 1:10:47.519
I facilitate large transfers
with guaranteed anonymity,

1:10:47.657 --> 1:10:48.830
no questions asked.

1:10:48.968 --> 1:10:49.969
So you help the
crooks get paid.

1:10:50.107 --> 1:10:51.661
Crooks like you.

1:10:51.799 --> 1:10:53.490
It's the future,
just as good as cash

1:10:53.628 --> 1:10:55.285
and completely untraceable.

1:10:55.423 --> 1:10:58.184
You know, I'm gonna
be killed for this.

1:10:58.323 --> 1:10:59.841
I'm in too deep, and I know
too much with these guys,

1:10:59.979 --> 1:11:02.016
so I really hope that you
guys can do something.

1:11:02.154 --> 1:11:05.191
I've seen the trades
this company's made.

1:11:05.330 --> 1:11:06.848
They're after something big.

1:11:06.986 --> 1:11:08.988
I know based on everything
you guys know about me,

1:11:09.126 --> 1:11:11.301
I'm a total piece of shit.

1:11:12.509 --> 1:11:15.063
I get that, but I've
really been trying

1:11:15.201 --> 1:11:17.307
to actually be a better person.

1:11:17.445 --> 1:11:19.102
So that in the case
that I do bow out,

1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:20.759
I'd like to go out as a
slightly smaller piece

1:11:20.897 --> 1:11:23.520
of shit than I am now.
What are you saying?

1:11:23.658 --> 1:11:27.524
What I am saying is that
they're on a different level.

1:11:27.662 --> 1:11:32.288
They wanna control everything,
full market manipulation.

1:11:33.530 --> 1:11:36.188
So I don't know if you
all are the good guys

1:11:36.326 --> 1:11:38.880
or the bad guys,
but it seems to me

1:11:39.018 --> 1:11:42.953
that you're all my best
chance of staying alive

1:11:44.196 --> 1:11:45.991
and to start being
a better person.

1:11:46.129 --> 1:11:50.754
Appreciate that sentiment.
The problem is we're all dead.

1:11:50.892 --> 1:11:53.205
We have no Z, so no
matter what we do,

1:11:53.343 --> 1:11:56.691
they'll always be
a day ahead of us.

1:12:03.733 --> 1:12:05.010
What the fuck is Z?

1:12:16.159 --> 1:12:20.059
- Stop flexing.
- I'm not.

1:12:20.197 --> 1:12:22.717
I'm starting to have
that feeling again.

1:12:22.855 --> 1:12:24.581
- That we should be dead?
- Why aren't we?

1:12:24.719 --> 1:12:25.824
They have our Z.

1:12:25.962 --> 1:12:28.171
Because they want
something else.

1:12:28.309 --> 1:12:29.448
Like more Z?

1:12:34.902 --> 1:12:36.938
- No.
- Do you know where he is?

1:12:37.076 --> 1:12:39.078
- No. Nobody does.
- Lee.

1:12:40.735 --> 1:12:43.635
Fine. He may have
reached out a couple times.

1:12:43.773 --> 1:12:45.291
That could be the 100
million dollar transaction.

1:12:45.430 --> 1:12:46.603
Finn, no.

1:12:46.741 --> 1:12:47.846
The only way to
protect ourselves

1:12:47.984 --> 1:12:49.399
from these guys is to
get more Z from Jay.

1:12:49.537 --> 1:12:50.883
But that's exactly
what we want,

1:12:51.021 --> 1:12:55.543
and as soon as we lead
them, there they'll kill us.

1:12:55.681 --> 1:12:57.787
Unless we make a plan.

1:12:59.271 --> 1:13:00.445
So again, where are we going?

1:13:02.447 --> 1:13:05.104
His name's Jay. He's the cook.

1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:10.282
- Something wrong?
- Hmm?

1:13:11.939 --> 1:13:14.700
We have a bit of a
complicated history.

1:13:14.838 --> 1:13:17.323
He used to pay me cash
to test out the Z Plus,

1:13:17.462 --> 1:13:21.017
and I haven't seen him since.
Since when?

1:13:23.226 --> 1:13:24.330
Since I stole it from him.

1:13:32.477 --> 1:13:33.547
So I know I've been
asking this a lot,

1:13:33.685 --> 1:13:34.824
but where are we going?

1:13:34.962 --> 1:13:36.998
- Jay's.
- Oh, right.

1:13:37.136 --> 1:13:38.655
He's the one who
invented the stuff.

1:13:38.793 --> 1:13:41.106
- The time travel pills?
- Yep.

1:13:41.244 --> 1:13:44.937
- Have you met this guy?
- No. Lee has.

1:13:45.075 --> 1:13:47.699
So, like time travel. Wow.

1:13:47.837 --> 1:13:50.495
Can someone just please explain
to me how all this works?

1:13:53.118 --> 1:13:53.946
Fine.

1:13:57.502 --> 1:13:59.780
So are you and the guy
with the 'stache a thing?

1:13:59.918 --> 1:14:02.403
I mean, are you
married or something?

1:14:02.541 --> 1:14:03.784
I mean, it seem like you guys
are really hitting it off.

1:14:03.922 --> 1:14:06.545

and they have the supply.

1:14:48.207 --> 1:14:51.245
And that's why I
stopped producing.

1:14:51.383 --> 1:14:53.730
You and I both know
you keep doing this,

1:14:53.868 --> 1:14:56.181
you'll end up dead or worse.

1:14:57.182 --> 1:14:58.010
So.

1:15:00.530 --> 1:15:01.669
Can you help us out?

1:15:03.533 --> 1:15:06.398
- Maybe.
- What do you want?

1:15:06.536 --> 1:15:07.882
I don't want anything.

1:15:08.020 --> 1:15:12.646
You know, we're not all
into this for personal gain.

1:15:13.543 --> 1:15:14.613
Plus, I only have one pill left.

1:15:14.751 --> 1:15:16.166
That's it?

1:15:16.304 --> 1:15:21.033
Well that and some
newly created muscle relaxers.

1:15:23.277 --> 1:15:25.313
What's wrong with 'em?

1:15:26.383 --> 1:15:27.971
They'll kill you.

1:15:41.019 --> 1:15:42.779
Lee was kind enough to
give me some of his clothes.

1:15:42.917 --> 1:15:46.162
No shit. You look like
Tommy Bahama fucked a wet dog.

1:15:52.306 --> 1:15:55.930
So how long have you
known the other guys?

1:15:59.624 --> 1:16:00.694
Need you guys
to jump in the van

1:16:00.832 --> 1:16:02.005
and put these sensors
down on any roadways

1:16:02.143 --> 1:16:04.456
that connect to here
within five miles.

1:16:04.594 --> 1:16:06.907
They come early, we'll know.

1:16:11.497 --> 1:16:14.397
Sophia's idea, and
a good one, too.

1:16:26.996 --> 1:16:30.931
So what are you going to do
when this is all done, huh?

1:16:31.069 --> 1:16:32.967
I haven't
thought that far.

1:16:33.105 --> 1:16:34.590
You gotta
keep running forever?

1:16:34.728 --> 1:16:37.213
I haven't thought about it.

1:16:41.666 --> 1:16:44.082
I am so sorry what I
did to you and the others.

1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:47.741
Save it, Jay.

1:16:47.879 --> 1:16:51.330
- No, I was selfish.
- Selfish? You think?

1:16:54.506 --> 1:16:57.613
You understand the up
things that you used to do?

1:16:57.751 --> 1:17:00.616
Recruiting desperate
people like me?

1:17:01.858 --> 1:17:03.791
I thought I was acting
in the name of science.

1:17:03.929 --> 1:17:06.414
I told you all about my
brother, how sick he was.

1:17:06.552 --> 1:17:10.246
He was my only family,
and I would do anything

1:17:10.384 --> 1:17:13.387
that I needed to
to help him out.

1:17:13.525 --> 1:17:16.148
And you never even
seemed to care, Jay.

1:17:16.286 --> 1:17:18.495
Every time we jumped,

1:17:18.634 --> 1:17:22.258
we lost a little bit of
our connection to reality.

1:17:22.396 --> 1:17:24.432
I know. It's just that
when you took the Z-

1:17:24.570 --> 1:17:25.986
When I took the Z,

1:17:26.124 --> 1:17:27.746
that's because that was the
quickest thing that I could do

1:17:27.884 --> 1:17:30.715
to get my brother the
money that he needed.

1:17:30.853 --> 1:17:33.510
And how did all that work out?

1:17:34.477 --> 1:17:35.858
I went too far.

1:17:36.962 --> 1:17:37.998
Eventually, I
couldn't differentiate

1:17:38.136 --> 1:17:40.966
between what happened
and what didn't.

1:17:41.104 --> 1:17:43.141
I ended up owing a lot of money.

1:17:43.279 --> 1:17:46.696
I don't wanna see you
crash like this, never again.

1:17:46.834 --> 1:17:49.181
Told you, I got
it figured out.

1:17:49.319 --> 1:17:50.700
I know.

1:17:50.838 --> 1:17:51.632
I know you think you have
it all under control,

1:17:51.770 --> 1:17:53.772
but believe me when I tell you,

1:17:53.910 --> 1:17:58.535
you're either gonna have to
give this up or bring others in.

1:17:58.674 --> 1:18:02.194
Jay, after this is done,
I'm getting rid of the Z Plus.

1:18:02.332 --> 1:18:03.886
Whatever you say.

1:18:04.990 --> 1:18:07.199
You wanna know
the worst thing?

1:18:07.337 --> 1:18:09.408
Put two grand on the Jets.
You serious?

1:18:09.546 --> 1:18:11.963
You came in and made that
bet yesterday, Lee, and lost.

1:18:12.101 --> 1:18:13.792
No I didn't.

1:18:13.930 --> 1:18:15.794
This is the
fifth time this week.

1:18:15.932 --> 1:18:17.796
You keep calling and
repeating yourself.

1:18:21.041 --> 1:18:23.457
Oh, shit. What day is it?

1:18:23.595 --> 1:18:25.735
Really? It's Tuesday.

1:18:25.873 --> 1:18:28.358
Lee, you okay?
No, I'm fine.

1:18:30.326 --> 1:18:32.397
I'm fine. I just,
I gotta go, Danny.

1:18:32.535 --> 1:18:37.229
Hi, Nancy. Yeah, I called my
brother, and I don't know.

1:18:37.367 --> 1:18:38.783
He must be sleeping or
something like that.

1:18:38.921 --> 1:18:41.026
I was just thinking
about coming by today.

1:18:41.164 --> 1:18:43.408
Lee, I'm
not sure I understand.

1:18:43.546 --> 1:18:44.720
No, I called Matt.

1:18:44.858 --> 1:18:45.790
I just need to come by and talk

1:18:45.928 --> 1:18:48.344
to him about some family stuff.

1:18:48.482 --> 1:18:49.310
Lee.

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:54.695
Our conversation
yesterday. Are you okay?

1:19:03.669 --> 1:19:08.295
At the end, I didn't even
know that my brother had died.

1:19:11.988 --> 1:19:12.989
I'm sorry.

1:19:17.994 --> 1:19:19.755
Uh uh, I'm driving.

1:19:23.344 --> 1:19:25.277
Okay, according to
the information we have

1:19:25.415 --> 1:19:27.383
from Simon and Martin, this
plan is based on the assumption

1:19:27.521 --> 1:19:29.903
that Derrick and his guys will
try to take us down tomorrow.

1:19:30.041 --> 1:19:31.249
First question is
who jumps forward

1:19:31.387 --> 1:19:33.423
since we only have one pill.

1:19:33.561 --> 1:19:35.253
It's Martin. Sorry, Sophia.

1:19:35.391 --> 1:19:37.703
He's got the experience.
Over the next 24 hours,

1:19:37.842 --> 1:19:39.602
I'll set up a security camera
system around the house

1:19:39.740 --> 1:19:41.328
that will record continuously.

1:19:41.466 --> 1:19:43.261
Martin, tomorrow,
you'll take the Z Plus.

1:19:43.399 --> 1:19:45.194
Presumably, you'll wake
up the day of the ambush.

1:19:45.332 --> 1:19:46.333
The security camera feed

1:19:46.471 --> 1:19:47.852
will be sent directly
to your phone.

1:19:47.990 --> 1:19:49.198
You'll have one hour to
scrub through the footage

1:19:49.336 --> 1:19:52.546
to find out exactly
when and how they come.

1:19:52.684 --> 1:19:53.443
I know I don't have
to tell you this,

1:19:53.581 --> 1:19:55.031
but every detail helps.

1:19:55.169 --> 1:19:56.515
Once you have the information,

1:19:56.653 --> 1:19:58.379
you'll wake up back here
and inform us of everything.

1:19:58.517 --> 1:19:59.622
At that point, Lee
and I will form a plan

1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:01.417
to recontextualize
events in our favor.

1:20:01.555 --> 1:20:03.695
Okay, first of all,
love the optimism,

1:20:03.833 --> 1:20:06.215
but each of Derrick's men
carry enough Z serum with them

1:20:06.353 --> 1:20:09.114
that they could be forwards
or backwards at any moment.

1:20:09.252 --> 1:20:12.600
So no matter what we do, they
will always be ahead of us.

1:20:12.738 --> 1:20:16.052
Even if this does succeed,
they're not going to stop.

1:20:16.190 --> 1:20:18.503
Noted. How can I help?

1:20:18.641 --> 1:20:20.677
How much control do you have
over Derrick's transactions?

1:20:20.816 --> 1:20:21.920
Redirect it?
Maybe.

1:20:22.058 --> 1:20:23.611
I mean, if we're
within a mile of Volkov

1:20:23.749 --> 1:20:27.270
when the transaction gets
improved, then yeah, probably.

1:20:27.408 --> 1:20:29.514
Love that confidence.

1:20:31.033 --> 1:20:33.138
Okay, well,
you'll have it tonight.

1:20:33.276 --> 1:20:35.071
Good, good. Very good.

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:39.835
Get the transfer ready.

1:20:39.973 --> 1:20:42.009
The funds will be in your
account until midnight tonight.

1:20:42.147 --> 1:20:43.804
Then we need answers.

1:20:46.945 --> 1:20:48.878
Hey, how are we doing?

1:20:50.535 --> 1:20:53.296
This definitely
isn't low risk.

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:57.197
We don't have to do this. We
can figure something else out.

1:20:57.335 --> 1:21:00.407
No. We're gonna
finish the job.

1:21:00.545 --> 1:21:02.754
- It'll work.
- And what if it doesn't?

1:21:02.892 --> 1:21:04.963
Then you guys can run.
Jay will make some more.

1:21:05.101 --> 1:21:08.070
You'll stay ahead. You'll
figure something out.

1:21:08.208 --> 1:21:11.314
Thought we were
getting rid of the Z.

1:21:11.452 --> 1:21:13.799
I'll leave that up to you.

1:21:18.114 --> 1:21:19.391
Hey. It's okay.

1:21:34.579 --> 1:21:35.683
Northwest sensor
just went off.

1:21:35.821 --> 1:21:37.616
Mm-hmm. Hide everyone.

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:42.898
We gotta move. Derrick
and his guys are early.

1:21:43.036 --> 1:21:44.244
They're gonna be
here in five minutes.

1:21:44.382 --> 1:21:47.247
Well, shit. So question.

1:21:47.385 --> 1:21:49.042
How am I supposed
to jump to tomorrow

1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:50.388
and give us an heads
up if we're all going

1:21:50.526 --> 1:21:53.115
to be dead within the hour?

1:21:57.636 --> 1:21:59.776
It's a beautiful day.

1:22:06.645 --> 1:22:09.372
You have a plan, don't you?
Are you serious?

1:22:09.510 --> 1:22:12.479
Well, don't tell me.

1:22:12.617 --> 1:22:15.827
I mean, I don't care.
I love surprises.

1:22:16.932 --> 1:22:18.071
Do you?

1:22:26.838 --> 1:22:28.460
Long time no see.

1:22:29.703 --> 1:22:32.775
I wanted to thank
you for the gift.

1:22:34.328 --> 1:22:35.122
Robert?

1:22:36.986 --> 1:22:39.678
The name's Derrick
now, Jay Tupple.

1:22:39.816 --> 1:22:42.958
What happened
to you, Robert?

1:22:43.096 --> 1:22:43.924
Derrick!

1:22:46.616 --> 1:22:48.239
The name is Derrick.

1:22:50.655 --> 1:22:55.108
They told me about your Z Plus,
the advances that you made.

1:22:55.246 --> 1:22:59.422
It's pretty amazing stuff
compared to what we used.

1:23:02.839 --> 1:23:05.635
- They're jumping.
- No, he's not.

1:23:07.223 --> 1:23:08.914
They only have one pill left.

1:23:09.053 --> 1:23:10.709
I was gonna take
it this afternoon.

1:23:13.712 --> 1:23:17.854
Sorry, Lee. I've had with
your self-serving rules.

1:23:20.064 --> 1:23:24.447
Your rules got me killed.
The girl is still inside.

1:23:26.104 --> 1:23:29.625
I mean, you've got a
time travel pill, right?

1:23:29.763 --> 1:23:34.768
And your first thought is,
"Oh, petty crime."

1:23:35.941 --> 1:23:37.460
You know what your
problem is, Lee?

1:23:37.598 --> 1:23:41.326
You've got no imagination.
I mean, look at you.

1:23:41.464 --> 1:23:45.813
You're a low budget Tom
Selleck cosplaying alcoholic.

1:23:47.056 --> 1:23:50.646
But us, we're gonna
change the world.

1:23:50.784 --> 1:23:52.165
You piece of shit.

1:23:52.303 --> 1:23:53.338
You led us straight to Jay

1:23:53.476 --> 1:23:54.960
and then you led
them straight here.

1:23:55.099 --> 1:23:58.171
Wait for us to make a plan,
and then you fucked us.

1:23:58.309 --> 1:23:59.344
Sorry.

1:23:59.482 --> 1:24:02.347
Don't you take
us and let them be?

1:24:02.485 --> 1:24:04.936
Oh, well, why would I do that?

1:24:05.074 --> 1:24:07.835
Because you need me alive.

1:24:07.973 --> 1:24:10.493
Fortunately for
me, you're fine.

1:24:10.631 --> 1:24:12.047
Except I'm not.

1:24:13.979 --> 1:24:16.637
I made these muscle relaxers,
and they're not good.

1:24:16.775 --> 1:24:18.570
I mean, they're deadly.

1:24:18.708 --> 1:24:20.020
Really, you should see

1:24:20.158 --> 1:24:24.507
in the back the mass graveyard
I have in place.

1:24:24.645 --> 1:24:27.717
So when I saw you
coming, I took one.

1:24:29.788 --> 1:24:32.619
I have about 30 minutes to live.

1:24:35.794 --> 1:24:37.072
You're lying.

1:24:41.973 --> 1:24:44.976
Go ahead, kill
him. I don't care.

1:24:45.114 --> 1:24:47.116
I mean, his mind is so
messed up from the Z,

1:24:47.254 --> 1:24:49.187
it's probably all mush.

1:24:51.016 --> 1:24:53.536
He's nothing to me. Worthless.

1:24:54.779 --> 1:24:58.058
- Thank you, Jay.
- No problem.

1:24:58.196 --> 1:25:01.406
But I know where an antidote is.

1:25:01.544 --> 1:25:03.443
It's buried in a safe
in an empty field

1:25:03.581 --> 1:25:05.238
about five miles from here.

1:25:07.240 --> 1:25:11.830
We go, leave them here, get
the antidote, and off we go.

1:25:21.081 --> 1:25:22.047
Oh, shit!

1:25:24.671 --> 1:25:26.569
I'm not fucking around here!

1:25:32.644 --> 1:25:34.059
Pack up the body.

1:25:34.198 --> 1:25:35.371
I'm sure there's
some experiments they

1:25:35.509 --> 1:25:37.649
could do if the old
man's not lying.

1:25:40.549 --> 1:25:43.621
Number one, number
two, take them inside.

1:25:43.759 --> 1:25:45.450
Number three and
I'll take this one.

1:25:45.588 --> 1:25:47.763
We'll meet you back here
once we have the antidote.

1:26:01.604 --> 1:26:02.812
Fuck!

1:26:02.950 --> 1:26:04.469
Simon, you need to calm down.

1:26:04.607 --> 1:26:06.471
Finn, Lee just got killed
and we lost a scientist.

1:26:06.609 --> 1:26:08.991
What the fuck do you want?
Everything's fine.

1:26:09.129 --> 1:26:12.546
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Are you sure, Finn?

1:26:14.065 --> 1:26:15.239
Trust me.

1:26:18.173 --> 1:26:19.415
Yes. We have the stash.

1:26:19.553 --> 1:26:22.073
We have the
scientist. Lee's dead.

1:26:22.211 --> 1:26:23.971
Well done. What's your ETA?

1:26:24.109 --> 1:26:26.111
We have a
little bit of a situation.

1:26:26.250 --> 1:26:28.113
Tupple poisoned himself.

1:26:28.252 --> 1:26:29.977
We're on our way to
get the antidote.

1:26:30.115 --> 1:26:32.394
Send your location.
I'll send someone.

1:26:32.532 --> 1:26:35.259
Okay, no. That's
not gonna work for me.

1:26:35.397 --> 1:26:37.571
And why is that, Mr. Volkov?

1:26:37.709 --> 1:26:40.816
Because once you know my
location, I'm a dead man.

1:26:40.954 --> 1:26:44.440
I need the transaction
approved before I return.

1:26:44.578 --> 1:26:45.993
Fine.

1:26:46.131 --> 1:26:46.925
I'll send half,

1:26:47.063 --> 1:26:48.548
but only after I see a picture

1:26:48.686 --> 1:26:50.998
of a healthy Dr.
Tupple will I approve.

1:26:51.136 --> 1:26:52.724
Okay, good. Deal.

1:26:55.451 --> 1:26:57.246
We have eight minutes to
get within one mile of them.

1:26:57.384 --> 1:26:58.730
Need to get to the van.

1:26:58.868 --> 1:27:01.008
Simon, you still think you
can redirect that transaction?

1:27:01.146 --> 1:27:02.458
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:27:02.596 --> 1:27:06.221
Computer's in the van.
You have the keys, right?

1:27:07.394 --> 1:27:10.397
Oh shit. I left
them on the counter.

1:27:11.433 --> 1:27:13.538
Okay. We'll get the keys.

1:27:13.676 --> 1:27:17.059
- How are you gonna do that?
- Improvise.

1:27:27.897 --> 1:27:29.071
Take it off!

1:27:32.385 --> 1:27:34.145
Tell us where the
antidote is buried.

1:27:34.283 --> 1:27:38.425
It's about two feet
underneath that red reflector.

1:27:38.563 --> 1:27:39.806
Go.

1:27:46.916 --> 1:27:48.263
You may have some trouble.

1:27:48.401 --> 1:27:51.127
It's not a combination
safe. It's an eye scanner.

1:27:51.266 --> 1:27:55.408
And if he uses his eyes,
you burn 'em right out.

1:27:55.546 --> 1:27:57.410
I'll call your bluff.

1:29:32.332 --> 1:29:34.748
Oh, fuck! Take Jay.

1:29:34.886 --> 1:29:36.440
No, no. I want you to take me.

1:29:36.578 --> 1:29:38.511
- Why? No.
- Fine. I'll die.

1:29:38.649 --> 1:29:41.617
I think we have five
minutes to get to them.

1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:55.217
Something's wrong?

1:29:55.355 --> 1:29:57.219
I don't trust you.

1:29:59.083 --> 1:30:00.291
Let's go.

1:30:06.918 --> 1:30:08.023
One minute.

1:30:13.097 --> 1:30:14.581
You know, Robert,

1:30:14.719 --> 1:30:16.756
I truly am sorry for what
I did to you and everyone.

1:30:16.894 --> 1:30:19.103
I mean, my intentions
were scientific.

1:30:19.241 --> 1:30:21.243
I wanted to see
what was possible,

1:30:21.381 --> 1:30:23.797
what the mind was capable of.

1:30:23.935 --> 1:30:25.316
If I had known this
storm was coming-

1:30:25.454 --> 1:30:27.111
Shut up!

1:30:30.217 --> 1:30:31.080
Do it.

1:30:34.670 --> 1:30:36.051
Cheers.

1:30:36.189 --> 1:30:37.604
Okay, pull over here.

1:30:56.796 --> 1:30:57.590
Great.

1:30:59.454 --> 1:31:01.697
Okay, good. The
transfer's been approved.

1:31:01.835 --> 1:31:04.355
Soon, the system will pinpoint
the address of the receiver

1:31:04.493 --> 1:31:06.150
and transfer the money
onto Volkov's device.

1:31:09.429 --> 1:31:10.499
The encryption process

1:31:10.637 --> 1:31:12.121
is behind a nearly
unbreakable firewall,

1:31:12.259 --> 1:31:14.123
and once it's on his
device and he's air gapped,

1:31:14.261 --> 1:31:16.816
the money's gone for good, but.

1:31:16.954 --> 1:31:18.300
What?

1:31:18.438 --> 1:31:21.510
Guess who helped design
the security system?

1:31:21.648 --> 1:31:25.100
Me. I did, I designed
the security system.

1:31:25.238 --> 1:31:26.377
Jesus.

1:31:39.528 --> 1:31:41.323
Who is this?

1:31:41.461 --> 1:31:43.843
Let's just say I'm a ghost.

1:31:50.919 --> 1:31:52.437
Where are you?

1:31:52.576 --> 1:31:56.027
Honestly, it's complicated,
time travel and whatnot.

1:31:56.165 --> 1:31:59.721
I just wanted to
say congratulations.
Jay's all yours.

1:31:59.859 --> 1:32:01.343
I never got your
name, by the way.

1:32:01.481 --> 1:32:03.034
If I can clone Derrick's
device and address,

1:32:03.172 --> 1:32:04.726
I can hijack the transfer,
and the money's ours.

1:32:04.864 --> 1:32:06.382
Just hope no one catches on.

1:32:06.521 --> 1:32:09.938
I ask again, where are you?

1:32:10.076 --> 1:32:14.218
Okay, fine. But first,
I have a question.

1:32:14.356 --> 1:32:16.116
What do you want with the Z?

1:32:16.254 --> 1:32:18.912
I mean, all this work to
track down a crazy old man.

1:32:19.050 --> 1:32:21.777
It's just me and my friends.
We love a good plan.

1:32:24.228 --> 1:32:25.056
Now we just need the system

1:32:25.194 --> 1:32:28.059
to find me before it finds him.

1:32:28.197 --> 1:32:29.474
Lee, do you know

1:32:29.613 --> 1:32:30.959
what the world's most
valuable resource is today?

1:32:31.097 --> 1:32:33.478
It's not money.
It's time.

1:32:33.617 --> 1:32:35.722
Now, it's data.

1:32:35.860 --> 1:32:40.485
Whoever controls the
information controls everything.

1:32:40.624 --> 1:32:45.180
People are products, Lee,
and with more information,

1:32:45.318 --> 1:32:48.839
the more you can tell them
what to think, how to act.

1:32:48.977 --> 1:32:51.911
We can bring people
together, Lee.

1:32:52.049 --> 1:32:55.259
Unfortunately, Jay Tupple
seems to be the only person

1:32:55.397 --> 1:32:57.779
who knows how to
make what I need.

1:32:57.917 --> 1:33:01.576
Six months ago, I received
a list of subjects

1:33:01.714 --> 1:33:04.958
that included both
you and Mr. Volkov.

1:33:05.096 --> 1:33:08.583
Our research showed that
you were the only ones aware

1:33:08.721 --> 1:33:10.792
of the location of Dr. Tupple.

1:33:10.930 --> 1:33:13.760
So why not kidnap me and cut
my fingers off or something?

1:33:13.898 --> 1:33:15.279
In the meantime,

1:33:15.417 --> 1:33:16.970
we figured we might use you
to replenish our finances,

1:33:17.108 --> 1:33:19.904
but second, Lee, as I said,

1:33:20.042 --> 1:33:24.253
we at the organization don't
like to get our hands dirty.

1:33:24.391 --> 1:33:25.600
Volkov.

1:33:25.738 --> 1:33:27.912
He's always sending
one man jumping forward,

1:33:28.050 --> 1:33:29.742
one man jumping back.

1:33:30.881 --> 1:33:34.332
He never stood a chance.
Okay, okay.

1:33:34.470 --> 1:33:38.509
Encryption's done. It's
bridging the two accounts.

1:33:38.647 --> 1:33:42.720
It's either gonna go to
us or them. Hopefully us.

1:33:42.858 --> 1:33:44.515
Now where are you?

1:33:46.655 --> 1:33:48.484
Right, sorry.

1:33:48.623 --> 1:33:51.280
Hmm. The better
question is when.

1:33:52.281 --> 1:33:53.524
Come on, come on.

1:33:55.215 --> 1:33:58.702
But sure,
physically, physically,

1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:00.807
I'm in a boat with 50
million in my bank account.

1:34:11.128 --> 1:34:12.094
It worked.

1:34:13.613 --> 1:34:14.683
It worked!

1:34:16.685 --> 1:34:21.034
Fuck yeah! Fucking told
you guys it would work!

1:34:34.047 --> 1:34:36.498
Martin, get out of there
and kill Derrick and take Jay.

1:34:36.636 --> 1:34:37.844
The money's all yours.

1:34:40.260 --> 1:34:41.745
Right now, you're probably
calling Martin telling him

1:34:41.883 --> 1:34:44.195
to get Jay and the Z
and get out of there.

1:34:44.333 --> 1:34:46.025
- Hey.
- Don't bother.

1:34:46.163 --> 1:34:49.545
He'll be stuck in there for
the next 30 seconds or so.

1:34:49.684 --> 1:34:50.788
If you knew our plans,

1:34:50.926 --> 1:34:52.445
the question is how
can you possibly know

1:34:52.583 --> 1:34:54.412
what's happening next?

1:34:55.931 --> 1:34:56.725
So you don't
think we have time

1:34:56.863 --> 1:34:58.106
to make a fake batch?

1:34:58.244 --> 1:35:00.039
Not one that's any good.

1:35:01.523 --> 1:35:04.215
We'll figure it out. Come in.

1:35:07.494 --> 1:35:10.187
- Did I interrupt something?
- No.

1:35:11.222 --> 1:35:12.568
Do we have a plan?

1:35:12.707 --> 1:35:15.882
Because I'm not thrilled about
being sidelined like this.

1:35:16.020 --> 1:35:19.092
We're working on it.

1:35:19.230 --> 1:35:21.888
How are you so sure
you could trust Simon

1:35:22.026 --> 1:35:23.683
or Martin for that matter?

1:35:23.821 --> 1:35:25.892
How do we know that
we can trust you?

1:35:26.030 --> 1:35:26.721
You can't, but if
you don't need me,

1:35:26.859 --> 1:35:29.068
I don't need to be here.

1:35:29.206 --> 1:35:30.345
Point taken.

1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:32.450
I have an idea.

1:35:34.176 --> 1:35:35.281
Need you guys
to jump in the van

1:35:35.419 --> 1:35:36.592
and put these sensors
down on any roadways

1:35:36.731 --> 1:35:38.905
that connect to here
within five miles.

1:35:39.043 --> 1:35:41.597
If they come early, we'll know.

1:35:42.564 --> 1:35:43.599
Martin didn't lay
down his sensors.

1:35:43.738 --> 1:35:44.911
Okay then.

1:35:54.956 --> 1:35:55.750
Okay.

1:35:55.888 --> 1:35:58.028
So they'll be here at 12:58 PM,

1:35:58.166 --> 1:36:00.651
Derrick and three guys in masks.

1:36:00.789 --> 1:36:02.273
Martin's in on it
like we thought.

1:36:02.411 --> 1:36:04.275
So we're gonna need that
fake pill that you gave me.

1:36:04.413 --> 1:36:07.347
I didn't totally hear why,
but Jay did something crazy,

1:36:07.485 --> 1:36:11.420
and they're talking about
someone named Robert.

1:36:12.387 --> 1:36:14.009
Lee, you get shot.

1:36:14.147 --> 1:36:15.977
- Where?
- In the chest.

1:36:16.115 --> 1:36:18.013
- It's gonna hurt.
- Four times.

1:36:18.151 --> 1:36:20.188
- Did you see him die?
- No.

1:36:20.326 --> 1:36:23.156
Okay, so right now Lee
is both alive and dead.

1:36:23.294 --> 1:36:27.505
Schrodinger's cat. Let's
set the odds in our favor.

1:36:30.301 --> 1:36:32.027
Martin, tomorrow,
you'll take the Z Plus.

1:36:32.165 --> 1:36:33.960
They only have one pill left.

1:36:34.098 --> 1:36:35.306
I was gonna take
it this afternoon.

1:36:38.033 --> 1:36:42.313
I'm not fucking around
here! Pack up the body.

1:36:42.451 --> 1:36:43.659
I'm sure there's
some experiments they

1:36:43.798 --> 1:36:46.214
could do if the old
man's not lying.

1:36:46.352 --> 1:36:48.319
Each of Derrick's
men carry enough Z serum

1:36:48.457 --> 1:36:49.873
with them that they
could be jumping forwards

1:36:50.011 --> 1:36:52.289
or backwards at any moment.

1:37:06.544 --> 1:37:10.997
I told you, my friends
and I, we love a good plan.

1:37:11.135 --> 1:37:12.033
See you later.

1:37:14.552 --> 1:37:16.002
I said let's go!

1:37:20.317 --> 1:37:22.560
We got him.

1:37:22.698 --> 1:37:24.459
Oh, shit, that was hot.

1:37:26.806 --> 1:37:29.050
No, no, no, no, no! Fuck!

1:37:30.223 --> 1:37:31.431
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

1:37:31.569 --> 1:37:34.331
God, he's got
bulletproof windows!

1:37:34.469 --> 1:37:37.161
Hey, you piece of
shit! You're dead!

1:37:37.299 --> 1:37:38.438
Look at me!

1:37:38.576 --> 1:37:39.854

1:37:43.478 --> 1:37:44.341

this matters, right?

1:37:50.347 --> 1:37:52.004
The organization
and I are weeks away

1:37:52.142 --> 1:37:56.249
from turning my old supply
of Z into your fancy Z Plus!

1:37:56.387 --> 1:37:57.561
So if you think-

1:37:57.699 --> 1:37:59.735
♪ I got the letter

1:37:59.874 --> 1:38:01.427

Whoo!

So, what's
next for you, Jay?

1:39:03.109 --> 1:39:06.492
Good question. I
really don't know yet.

1:39:08.356 --> 1:39:11.876
Well, you know they're
gonna be after you.

1:39:12.015 --> 1:39:14.810
Yeah, but don't
worry about me.

1:39:14.949 --> 1:39:16.502
I'll go home, I'll
do some fishing,

1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:19.229
and I'll wait for my next call.

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:25.821
You've been using.

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:28.997
- How you feeling?
- Okay, just weird.

1:39:34.451 --> 1:39:37.005
The future that you
saw yesterday when
you jumped forward,

1:39:37.143 --> 1:39:41.458
how close was that to what
actually happened today?

1:39:41.596 --> 1:39:44.116
It was pretty close, I think.

1:39:48.672 --> 1:39:50.674
Can I ask you something?

1:39:51.744 --> 1:39:54.816
All these like
memories and timelines,

1:39:54.954 --> 1:39:57.922
how do you decide what's real?

1:39:58.061 --> 1:40:00.925
Look around,

1:40:01.064 --> 1:40:03.652
figure out what you
believe is true right now,

1:40:03.790 --> 1:40:05.654
and just commit to it.

1:40:07.553 --> 1:40:10.659
And if you still have
questions, you can ask me.

1:40:34.338 --> 1:40:36.030
Son of a bitch.

1:40:36.168 --> 1:40:37.238
Hey, how's it going?

1:40:37.376 --> 1:40:39.550
Whoever this is,
leave a message.

1:40:39.688 --> 1:40:40.965
This is a courtesy call.

1:40:41.104 --> 1:40:45.315
I hope you're running
because whenever we find you,

1:40:46.764 --> 1:40:49.215
well, you and
whoever you are with

1:40:49.353 --> 1:40:51.390
are going to wish you were dead.

1:40:51.528 --> 1:40:52.770
Well, we don't
need money anymore.

1:40:56.015 --> 1:40:57.706
So what's the plan?

1:40:59.398 --> 1:41:02.228
Let's see
how far those pills get you

1:41:02.366 --> 1:41:05.404
because now they're
your only chance.

1:41:06.888 --> 1:41:10.512
You can say goodbye to
living in the moment, Lee,

1:41:10.650 --> 1:41:14.861
because from this moment on,
if you want to stay alive,

1:41:14.999 --> 1:41:16.898
you'll be living
in the yesterday,

1:41:18.244 --> 1:41:20.557
the today, and the tomorrow.

1:41:34.226 --> 1:41:36.055
Welcome to tomorrow.

1:43:02.383 --> 1:43:04.695
Hello. I have some news.

1:43:06.249 --> 1:43:09.113
We've had a successful test.

1:43:09.252 --> 1:43:11.426
We believed we've
cracked the formula.

1:43:11.564 --> 1:43:15.672
- Really?
- Yes and no.

1:43:16.569 --> 1:43:18.882
What we've created is close.

1:43:20.297 --> 1:43:24.405
However, whereas Z Plus
allowed trading between days,

1:43:24.543 --> 1:43:27.787
this one appears to be stronger.

1:43:29.064 --> 1:43:30.514
How so?

1:43:30.652 --> 1:43:34.380
Sir, this isn't a
matter of hours or days.

1:43:35.726 --> 1:43:40.421
We're talking about
weeks, months, maybe more.
