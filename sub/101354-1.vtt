03:01.420 --> 03:03.841
- Hello, you handsome son of a bitch.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.242
Time for me to get what's mine.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.920
Wendy?

03:17.830 --> 03:19.153
- I'm in the kitchen.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.330
- Hey.

03:24.030 --> 03:25.466
- Hello.

03:25.490 --> 03:26.570
- Smells

03:28.410 --> 03:30.026
good.

03:30.050 --> 03:31.306
- Thanks.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.136
- Oh, uh, what do you want me to do with

03:33.160 --> 03:35.503
Will's will thingy here?

03:35.527 --> 03:36.566
- Oh,

03:36.590 --> 03:38.396
just leave it on the table,

03:38.420 --> 03:40.753
I'm gonna put it in my
bedroom until later.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.640
- Whatever.

03:46.150 --> 03:47.583
Where's that kid of yours?

03:49.030 --> 03:51.996
- Dana is at my parent's.

03:52.020 --> 03:53.020
- That

03:54.470 --> 03:56.060
is excellent news.

03:57.290 --> 03:59.053
- I'm going to ignore that.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.493
- Yes, I've noticed.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.603
No wine glasses?

04:09.070 --> 04:11.426
- There's no wine, so.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.666
- Who hosts a dinner party without wine?

04:13.690 --> 04:15.769
- Wayne, I can't afford it.

04:15.793 --> 04:18.206
- Then I guess I'm off to the liquor store

04:18.230 --> 04:19.416
to procure some wine

04:19.440 --> 04:21.490
with my fabulous Derek Jeter-like wealth.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.466
Even those poor bastards at
the last supper had wine.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.298
- Look, Wayne.

04:28.322 --> 04:29.227
- Yeah.

04:29.251 --> 04:32.193
- Can we please be civil tonight?

04:33.390 --> 04:34.916
- It was ridiculous while Will was alive,

04:34.940 --> 04:38.226
but now that he's dead,
let's just drop the charade,

04:38.250 --> 04:39.381
shall we?

04:39.405 --> 04:40.405
Yeah.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.582
- What an asshole!

05:02.920 --> 05:03.730
- Hello.

05:03.754 --> 05:04.952
- Hi.

05:13.870 --> 05:17.026
- It's just that boarding
school is so far away.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.236
- It'll be all right.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.550
We'll see each other on

05:21.400 --> 05:22.423
weekends.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
- Weekends?

05:26.358 --> 05:27.906
But it won't be the same.

05:27.930 --> 05:28.930
- No,

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
it won't be.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.474
It'll never be like this again!

05:37.440 --> 05:39.153
Thank you for coming, Steve.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.511
- Of course.

06:01.490 --> 06:03.343
- Dinner should be ready soon,

06:04.210 --> 06:06.083
please make yourself comfortable.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
- Thanks.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.304
You all right?

06:25.328 --> 06:27.237
I'm fine, fine.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.440
- Mm.

06:55.256 --> 06:57.096
Would you get that, Steve?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.553
- Yeah, no problem, sure.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.100
Tom.

07:07.015 --> 07:08.111
- Hi Steve.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.270
- Come in!

07:21.180 --> 07:22.384
- Thanks.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.813
So, are you?

07:36.872 --> 07:38.196
- Wendy's in the kitchen, cooking,

07:38.220 --> 07:39.220
I just got here like

07:40.277 --> 07:41.952
a moment ago.

07:45.390 --> 07:46.390
Some decor.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.076
- I was just thinking the same thing.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.956
Does it bother you?

07:51.980 --> 07:53.316
- No, why would it?

07:53.340 --> 07:55.890
- Well, it's making me feel
a little uncomfortable.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.526
- I have a minor flower allergy,

07:59.550 --> 08:02.146
but nothing that debilitates
me to the point of...

08:02.170 --> 08:05.056
- I was talking more about
the pictures of Will.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.566
- No, why would it?

08:07.590 --> 08:08.996
- Well, there's

08:09.020 --> 08:11.666
an unusually large number
of pictures of Will.

08:11.690 --> 08:14.856
- No, I mean, I'm fine with it.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.880
Really.

08:17.383 --> 08:19.050
What's done is done.

08:22.180 --> 08:24.666
I didn't see you at the funeral.

08:24.690 --> 08:26.544
- I was out of town, man,

08:26.568 --> 08:28.584
I was able to make the wake, though.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.096
- Oh,

08:30.120 --> 08:31.087
your dad?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.683
- Yeah, I had to check him
into the hospital again.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.263
- Ka boom!

08:38.287 --> 08:39.287
- Lower your voice!

08:40.080 --> 08:41.283
- Relax.

08:42.169 --> 08:43.446
Geez, who died?

08:43.470 --> 08:44.470
Oh yeah.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.791
- Do you think it's a party?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.886
Well, you know,

08:49.910 --> 08:51.796
it's kind of a party,

08:51.820 --> 08:54.483
I mean, it's not a very
good party, but you know,

08:55.430 --> 08:57.670
it's a dinner party, so,
that's a kind of party.

08:57.694 --> 08:58.846
- It's not a party at all.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.736
- Hey, it's Dr. Tom.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.656
Dr. Tom.

09:01.680 --> 09:02.680
- Hello Dave.

09:03.948 --> 09:06.026
- Hey, you guys look, a,

09:06.050 --> 09:09.339
you guys are pretty
good, you're all pimping.

09:09.363 --> 09:10.489
Pimping!

09:10.513 --> 09:12.706
- And you look like you're
going down the shore.

09:12.730 --> 09:13.876
- It's Friday.

09:13.900 --> 09:14.886
Let me ask you a question,

09:14.910 --> 09:18.056
is there a large amount of
flowers here, like unusually,

09:18.080 --> 09:19.546
like, too many flowers?

09:19.570 --> 09:20.876
- Well the man is dead!

09:20.900 --> 09:22.976
- Lower your voice.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.106
- Her husband died, okay!

09:25.130 --> 09:26.703
She can put out a few flowers.

09:26.727 --> 09:28.946
- But it's like the
fucking Rose Bowl in here.

09:28.970 --> 09:30.086
- There does seem to be some

09:30.110 --> 09:31.956
compensation going on for something.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.036
Lower your voice!

09:34.060 --> 09:36.076
- Look, all I'm saying,

09:36.100 --> 09:37.716
I'm sitting here, I look the flowers,

09:37.740 --> 09:39.986
I look at the picture,
I look at more flowers,

09:40.010 --> 09:42.426
I see another photo, I see more flowers,

09:42.450 --> 09:45.596
I see another photo, I see
another photo, I see flowers!

09:45.620 --> 09:46.620
- Shut up!

09:47.570 --> 09:48.603
- It's unhealthy.

09:49.460 --> 09:53.476
It's not like there's a kinda
singul shrine to Will in here.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.946
He's a doctor.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.626
- It's more like a pharaoh's tomb,

09:56.650 --> 09:57.896
and it's not like these flowers

09:57.920 --> 09:59.006
are left over from the funeral,

09:59.030 --> 10:01.136
that was too long, they'd be dead by now.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
- Like Will.

10:03.260 --> 10:04.593
- Shut up, Dave!

10:06.910 --> 10:09.006
- You get offended every
time I say anything!

10:09.030 --> 10:10.326
You're like a mother hen.

10:10.350 --> 10:11.317
- What?

10:11.341 --> 10:12.151
- You know what you sound like?

10:12.175 --> 10:14.876
You sound like Mary's mother
from "It's A Wonderful Life".

10:14.900 --> 10:16.606
Steve, let me ask you a question,

10:16.630 --> 10:19.876
when was the last time you
made violent love to a woman?

10:19.900 --> 10:22.546
Was it Wendy?
- Stop right there, okay.

10:22.570 --> 10:24.866
Lower your voice, stop acting like a dick.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.233
- Steve.
- What the hell was...

10:26.257 --> 10:27.317
- Steve, Steve,

10:27.341 --> 10:28.686
this night is becoming a
little too much for you,

10:28.710 --> 10:29.520
I can see that.

10:29.544 --> 10:30.566
- You're actually becoming a little...

10:30.590 --> 10:31.576
- Yeah, that's fine.

10:31.600 --> 10:36.146
What I need you to do,
is sit down, relax, okay?

10:36.170 --> 10:37.946
I'll go in the kitchen,
check on the beer 'sitch.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.416
- I'll check the beer 'sitch.
- No, you sit down and relax,

10:40.440 --> 10:41.996
everything's gonna be fine.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.136
Maybe I'll touch a boob, I don't know.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
- Oh, fuck you.

10:48.870 --> 10:49.935
- Hey.

10:52.310 --> 10:54.035
Keeping secrets?

10:55.140 --> 10:56.140
- More like

10:56.810 --> 10:58.010
protecting my interests.

10:59.420 --> 11:00.420
- Whatever.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.156
You got any beer?

11:05.180 --> 11:06.180
- No.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.736
- Right, you don't drink beer,

11:09.760 --> 11:12.146
I forgot about your aversion to fun.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.606
- I have an aversion

11:15.630 --> 11:18.186
to irresponsibility, if
that's what you mean.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.876
- A couple of beers is not irresponsible.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.066
- It is if you need to
spend that money on food.

11:24.090 --> 11:26.136
- Beer was used as a source of nutrition

11:26.160 --> 11:27.556
during the Black Plague.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.286
- A problem modern sanitation

11:29.310 --> 11:31.996
seems up to the challenge of
handling, don't you think?

11:32.020 --> 11:33.406
- Yeah, I spend a lot of time

11:33.430 --> 11:35.226
thinking about the Black Plague.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.656
- You used to spend a lot of time

11:36.680 --> 11:38.146
thinking about a lot of things,

11:38.170 --> 11:42.076
maybe if just would have
applied yourself a little bit

11:42.100 --> 11:43.848
instead of dropping out of school,

11:43.872 --> 11:45.766
then we wouldn't be..
- I don't have any interest

11:45.790 --> 11:47.836
in discussing things
that happened between us

11:47.860 --> 11:49.486
like 10 years ago.

11:49.510 --> 11:50.773
Like, at all.

11:54.780 --> 11:55.780
- Right.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.996
- Well, there's no beer.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.656
- Wendy doesn't drink beer.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.680
- Yeah, right right.

12:08.810 --> 12:09.747
- Tom,

12:09.771 --> 12:11.223
hello.
- Hello.

12:12.610 --> 12:15.076
- Well, dinner is almost ready,

12:15.100 --> 12:16.950
you wanna follow me into the kitchen.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.656
- Well, this is great, Wendy.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.676
- And the presentation!

12:36.700 --> 12:39.326
- And what fabulous window treatment!

12:39.350 --> 12:42.216
Oh, and what a great centerpiece, amazing!

12:42.240 --> 12:43.273
Can we eat now?

12:44.280 --> 12:46.616
- We are waiting for Wayne.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
- Sure.

12:50.074 --> 12:51.736
- Did you get a cat?

12:51.760 --> 12:54.598
- No, I have no idea what that sound was.

12:56.550 --> 12:59.986
So, Tom, how's your practice going,

13:00.010 --> 13:02.716
is it tough being out there on your own?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.216
- Tough isn't the word,

13:04.240 --> 13:06.763
it's hard to get new patients and

13:06.787 --> 13:08.466
you can forget about word of mouth

13:08.490 --> 13:11.776
when your best customers are wackos.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.610
- Wackos?

13:12.634 --> 13:14.896
Is that a technical term, doctor?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.046
- Well,

13:16.070 --> 13:17.230
not really, but

13:18.960 --> 13:20.590
sometimes, I...

13:22.008 --> 13:23.196
Do you ever think that maybe

13:23.220 --> 13:24.706
you've gone into the wrong profession?

13:24.730 --> 13:25.730
Yes.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.726
- I shouldn't tell you guys this, but

13:29.750 --> 13:30.786
what the hell.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.756
I'll be sitting there
listening to a patient

13:32.780 --> 13:34.846
and they're going on about God knows what,

13:34.870 --> 13:37.186
dumb stuff, boring stuff,

13:37.210 --> 13:39.266
ridiculous stuff that's not real,

13:39.290 --> 13:41.586
and part of me wants to
grab them by the lapels

13:41.610 --> 13:43.323
and start screaming in their face!

13:43.347 --> 13:45.806
But, I know I can't do that.

13:45.830 --> 13:50.323
So instead, I just end up
shutting down, literally,

13:50.347 --> 13:53.156
and I fall asleep in
the middle of a session.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.013
- So you fell asleep once, big deal.

13:55.980 --> 13:57.716
- More like once a day.

13:57.740 --> 13:58.550
- Oh.

13:58.574 --> 13:59.696
- Minimum.
- Oh.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.846
- I'm only doing slightly
better than that.

14:01.870 --> 14:02.717
- If you're staying awake,

14:02.741 --> 14:04.596
you're doing a lot better than me.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.036
- I'm staying awake,

14:06.060 --> 14:08.806
but I can be talking, I'm in court,

14:08.830 --> 14:10.536
I don't even know what I'm saying.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.736
I'll be talking and all of
the sudden I find myself

14:13.760 --> 14:15.398
spouting gibberish.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.116
Murder,

14:18.140 --> 14:20.006
and we've all made that mistake,

14:20.030 --> 14:21.466
accidents happen.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.166
We've all done it, I know I've done it,

14:23.190 --> 14:25.133
you've done it, you've done it,

14:26.010 --> 14:27.886
I'm sure your honor has done it.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.910
- Counselor.

14:29.705 --> 14:31.546
- We all make mistakes.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.523
It's a very easy mistake to make.

14:34.400 --> 14:38.389
It's very easy to scratch
the paint on your car,

14:38.413 --> 14:40.256
you know, 'cause you have your key out,

14:40.280 --> 14:44.076
and on the key is the
button to unlock the door!

14:44.100 --> 14:45.242
- Counselor.

14:46.690 --> 14:47.856
- Same button, same key.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.166
- Counselor!
- Which brings me

14:50.190 --> 14:54.936
to my client's state of mind
on February the 5th, 2011.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.506
Gibberish, it's embarrassing.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.066
Hello?

14:59.090 --> 15:00.553
- We're in the back.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.676
- Yo,

15:04.700 --> 15:05.936
I brought wine.

15:06.794 --> 15:09.453
- One bottle for five people, thank you.

15:11.594 --> 15:12.644
And it's a twist off.

15:20.770 --> 15:23.896
- So, why do you drink wine, Wayne?

15:23.920 --> 15:27.382
- I only drink cheap Italian wine.

15:29.820 --> 15:31.246
You mean instead of beer?

15:31.270 --> 15:34.176
- Well, stereotypically speaking,

15:34.200 --> 15:37.566
a lot of sports fans like yourself

15:37.590 --> 15:40.076
tend to drink more beer than wine.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.376
- More alcohol per volume, son!

15:42.400 --> 15:46.166
Besides, beer is quire
and liquor is thicker,

15:46.190 --> 15:49.113
but wine is fine, or something like that.

15:54.510 --> 15:57.143
So, what were you guys talking about?

15:58.090 --> 15:59.466
- Work,

15:59.490 --> 16:02.666
Tom's practice, Steve's practice.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.776
- Oh doc, I have a question for you,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.246
does anyone come in
with like weird dreams?

16:07.270 --> 16:09.436
'Cause I've been having the same one

16:09.460 --> 16:11.466
over and over.

16:11.490 --> 16:12.427
- What about?

16:12.451 --> 16:14.126
- You know that scene in "Fight Club"

16:14.150 --> 16:16.456
where Brad Pitt and Ed Norton realize

16:16.480 --> 16:17.956
that they're the same person?

16:17.980 --> 16:19.656
- Thanks a lot!

16:19.680 --> 16:22.346
- Oh, my God, that was like
15 years ago, seriously?

16:22.370 --> 16:26.306
Anyway, so, I'm Ed Norton
in the dream, right.

16:26.330 --> 16:27.277
- Yeah.

16:27.301 --> 16:28.496
- Well, there's more.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.646
Instead of my second personality

16:30.670 --> 16:34.046
being a soap making, underground boxing,

16:34.070 --> 16:36.226
terrorist cell leader, okay?

16:36.250 --> 16:37.346
- Okay.

16:37.370 --> 16:40.296
- He's on his way to
becoming a Catholic deacon.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.756
Really, what?

16:41.780 --> 16:43.386
- Yeah, a Catholic deacon.

16:43.410 --> 16:44.410
- Well,

16:45.190 --> 16:47.086
you are catholic.

16:47.110 --> 16:48.456
- I'm agnostic.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.356
- Right, well, so, instead of

16:51.380 --> 16:54.056
like being chiseled Brad Pitt, you're

16:54.080 --> 16:55.906
just really, really into catholicism?

16:55.930 --> 16:56.930
Exactly.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.006
- But he is.

16:59.030 --> 17:01.896
- Like, I confess how you wanna confess,

17:01.920 --> 17:05.022
I worship how you wanna
worship, it's fucking weird.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.185
- I think

17:07.210 --> 17:08.713
you're going to be okay.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.579
- Thanks doc.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.063
- And what about you, Steve,

17:14.087 --> 17:16.346
how are things at your practice?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.886
- It's,

17:17.910 --> 17:20.076
it's funny what he said,
it's actually a lot like

17:20.099 --> 17:22.266
Tom was saying, it's really, really hard

17:22.290 --> 17:23.576
to get the word out.

17:23.599 --> 17:27.496
A lot of my clients
have to go pro bono, so,

17:27.520 --> 17:30.296
you know, people that are
getting picked on by the system.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.362
- Like Santa Claus.

17:32.386 --> 17:33.196
What?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.936
- How've you not seen
"Miracle On 34th Street"?

17:35.960 --> 17:37.926
- For one, I'm Jewish.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.306
- That's no excuse.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.216
- Not an excuse, it's a reason.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.596
- Are you representing
Kris Kringle or not?

17:43.620 --> 17:46.473
- That is the sort of
case we would do, yes,

17:47.490 --> 17:50.166
hypothetically, doesn't pay well though.

17:50.190 --> 17:51.616
- So,

17:51.640 --> 17:55.103
couldn't you do some
kind of advertising then?

17:55.127 --> 17:58.276
To bring in a more prosperous client?

17:58.300 --> 18:00.506
- Well, advertising, yeah.

18:00.530 --> 18:01.683
Well, the thing is the

18:02.570 --> 18:06.516
my mortgage and the insurance

18:06.540 --> 18:09.510
and the insurance for
the business itself and

18:11.000 --> 18:11.897
I don't have the money,

18:11.921 --> 18:15.086
to budget in for
advertising and investment.

18:15.110 --> 18:17.116
- Well, you know, Will always said that

18:17.140 --> 18:18.876
you are a very good lawyer,

18:18.900 --> 18:23.286
so I'm sure this will all work itself out.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.310
- Well, thanks.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
- So.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
- So.

18:34.090 --> 18:35.090
- The store.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.483
- Yes Dave, how are things
down at the toy store?

18:43.340 --> 18:48.340
- The Spider's Web is not a toy store!

18:48.630 --> 18:51.306
- But it's like you sell toys, right?

18:51.330 --> 18:55.056
- We sell comic books, graphic novels,

18:55.080 --> 18:58.446
various collectables and busts.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.470
- Bust?

19:00.520 --> 19:03.976
- No, not busts, like busts.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.023
Although, that would be
awesome though, right?

19:07.930 --> 19:09.376
Right?

19:09.400 --> 19:11.953
Completely different kind of store, right?

19:14.600 --> 19:18.976
- How is the collectables
business this days?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.646
- Pretty much sucks.

19:20.670 --> 19:23.616
You know, the collectables
and the busts do okay.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.116
- Busts.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.606
- But weekly comic books sales,

19:26.630 --> 19:29.526
just don't drive foot
traffic anymore, you know,

19:29.550 --> 19:33.006
we're lucky to get people
in a few times a year.

19:33.030 --> 19:33.840
- How could that be?

19:33.864 --> 19:37.406
I see like 10 comic book
movies last year alone.

19:37.430 --> 19:38.278
- Yeah, well you know,

19:38.302 --> 19:40.736
there's no much trickle down actually.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.896
Things be the way they are,

19:41.920 --> 19:46.226
we're lucky if we make it
through the rest of the year.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.663
- Oh, jeez, I'm sorry to hear that, man.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.286
- I'm sorry, Dave.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.776
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Dave, jeez!

19:55.800 --> 19:59.206
- Yeah, well, you know,
things could be worse.

19:59.230 --> 20:00.253
Could be dead.

20:02.210 --> 20:03.020
Right?

20:03.044 --> 20:04.173
- Right.

20:05.350 --> 20:06.443
- To life.

20:07.550 --> 20:08.895
Right?
- To life.

20:08.919 --> 20:10.636
To life.

20:10.660 --> 20:11.876
One of those.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.956
give me that, put it, click it,

20:13.980 --> 20:17.726
put it on there, if you catch that, yeah.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.864
Don't be quiet.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.906
- So, well, what about you, Wendy,

20:33.930 --> 20:35.533
are you cooking anywhere now?

20:37.100 --> 20:39.993
- I'm in between jobs right now,

20:40.870 --> 20:44.396
the vegan chef market is
bigger than it used to be

20:44.420 --> 20:46.343
but it's still,

20:47.850 --> 20:49.926
pretty fucking small!

20:49.950 --> 20:52.336
- Would it kill you to grill up a steak?

20:52.360 --> 20:53.913
- It would kill the cow!

20:59.670 --> 21:01.436
Are you still a

21:01.460 --> 21:05.196
bigger movie aficionado
as you used to be, Dave?

21:05.220 --> 21:08.216
- I try to watch a movie
that I've never seen

21:08.240 --> 21:09.636
every single night.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.226
- What an ambitious goal.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.393
- Oh yeah, it's the test.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.727
- I'm sorry?

21:15.751 --> 21:17.506
- Yeah, I'm just saying
watching movies is great,

21:17.530 --> 21:19.476
now can read this will
thing, or what's the story?

21:19.500 --> 21:21.176
- Seriously.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.656
- It's in my,

21:22.680 --> 21:24.446
it's in my bedroom, I'll get it,

21:24.470 --> 21:26.049
I'll get it after dinner.

21:26.073 --> 21:27.073
- All right.

21:33.670 --> 21:34.820
- I'm sorry, it's just,

21:36.055 --> 21:37.946
I hear what I have to confront,

21:37.970 --> 21:39.946
it's so head on, you know?

21:39.970 --> 21:42.599
- There are photos of him everywhere.

21:43.750 --> 21:47.936
For real, it's like Will's
portrait studio up in this peace.

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
- It's just

21:49.840 --> 21:51.223
so hard.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.246
- Yeah, you know, it's
probably harder than Will

21:55.270 --> 21:56.134
being dead and all.

21:56.158 --> 21:57.896
- Oh, for God's sakes!

21:57.920 --> 22:00.946
- I'm just saying, that
Will is the one who is dead

22:00.970 --> 22:03.679
and if you wanna feel bad for
somebody, feel bad for Will.

22:03.703 --> 22:06.876
- It's not as if nothing happened to me.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.616
- You got the house!

22:08.640 --> 22:11.226
- That I have no way of paying for.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.786
- Yet your budget has
an individual lying item

22:13.810 --> 22:17.816
for enough flowers to make
poison Ivy herself flash.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.976
- What?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.476
- He's doing a Batman reference.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.356
- Pamela Isley, it's Batman doing this.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.782
- Oh,

22:23.806 --> 22:26.206
well, flowers are fake.

22:26.230 --> 22:27.207
- You're fake!
- All right,

22:27.231 --> 22:28.556
that's enough.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.389
- Enough of what?

22:29.413 --> 22:30.223
- Dude!

22:30.247 --> 22:32.066
- I'm just saying we all have problems

22:32.090 --> 22:33.676
and I don't think anybody here

22:33.700 --> 22:36.436
is particularly happy with their situation

22:36.460 --> 22:38.466
and I'm not gonna sit here, okay,

22:38.490 --> 22:40.326
and pretend the their marriage

22:40.350 --> 22:42.716
was anything more than a charade.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.876
- You need to stop now!

22:45.900 --> 22:47.486
- Oh, get a grip!

22:47.510 --> 22:49.136
And by the way,

22:49.160 --> 22:52.056
you need to learn how to
work the privacy settings

22:52.080 --> 22:55.156
on your social media a little better.

22:55.180 --> 22:59.156
- I went out on one date with that moron

22:59.180 --> 23:00.836
while Will and I were separated

23:00.860 --> 23:04.376
and he photoshopped my
face onto that picture.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.726
- So you're saying

23:05.750 --> 23:08.716
the princess Leia "Return
To The Jedi" costume

23:08.740 --> 23:11.116
is not tucked away in your attic?

23:11.140 --> 23:13.590
Because that's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.266
- I'm happy with my situation.

23:17.290 --> 23:18.596
- Excuse me for a second,

23:18.620 --> 23:19.430
what's that?

23:19.454 --> 23:21.496
- A second ago you were
saying nobody at the table

23:21.520 --> 23:25.026
was happy with their
situation in life, I'm good.

23:25.050 --> 23:28.016
- You have no idea what
you're talking about,

23:28.040 --> 23:30.476
Will made it this way with his

23:30.500 --> 23:34.556
high stakes, short selling, whatever.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.086
- Is that why he killed himself?

23:36.110 --> 23:36.920
- Dude!

23:36.944 --> 23:39.826
- He did not kill himself.

23:39.850 --> 23:41.676
- Oh, but it was you then?
- Okay,

23:41.700 --> 23:42.856
this is a good opportunity

23:42.880 --> 23:45.512
for everyone to take a deep breath.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.916
Good.

23:48.940 --> 23:51.423
Have a sip of wine.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.496
Take another deep breath.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.656
- This is not over.

23:59.727 --> 24:02.936
- And we can focus our energy

24:02.960 --> 24:07.296
in a more positive direction.

24:07.320 --> 24:11.186
- Yeah, but why don't
we go around the table

24:11.210 --> 24:12.177
and

24:12.201 --> 24:14.983
share some things about Will,

24:15.007 --> 24:16.636
'cause that's why we're here.

24:16.660 --> 24:18.906
- We're certainly here because of Will.

24:18.930 --> 24:20.006
- Exactly.

24:20.030 --> 24:22.226
So, I'll start, I'll start.

24:22.250 --> 24:25.046
Will was very,

24:25.070 --> 24:27.773
Will was, Will was very clean!

24:28.720 --> 24:29.530
He was clean.

24:29.554 --> 24:32.976
- That was a well trimmed beard.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.936
- Sort of made it look
like Frasier, you know.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.866
- Yes, yes I can see that, yeah.

24:38.890 --> 24:41.183
- I remember he borrowed
large sums of money from me

24:41.207 --> 24:43.276
and was never able to pay me back.

24:43.300 --> 24:44.456
- Yeah,

24:44.480 --> 24:45.630
that.
- Cheers.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.126
- I had such a good time

24:51.150 --> 24:53.109
watching the World Series with Will.

24:57.340 --> 24:59.490
Wendy put out an amazing
spread that month.

25:00.920 --> 25:04.396
He was so happy, he really enjoyed that.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.396
That's why I'll always remember him,

25:06.420 --> 25:08.573
embracing euphoria.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.268
- I'll remember he was
pissed drunk that night.

25:12.292 --> 25:14.586
Oh, Will.

25:14.610 --> 25:16.053
- Oh, please.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.846
- Did anybody see the game

25:19.870 --> 25:20.996
last night?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.386
- No.

25:22.410 --> 25:25.227
I was helping Dana with
her book report.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.676
- Awful pitching.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.323
- Yeah, it was terrible.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.826
- If we learned anything from 2004,

25:32.850 --> 25:35.683
it's that you can plug in
your way to World Series.

25:36.650 --> 25:38.693
- Started pitching with championships.

25:40.010 --> 25:42.886
- So, what's the book report on?

25:42.910 --> 25:44.666
- Thank you, Jackie Robinson.

25:44.690 --> 25:46.796
- Oh, that's good, that's good.

25:46.820 --> 25:48.806
- Good coincidence, we're
just talking about baseball

25:48.830 --> 25:50.543
and then a baseball player.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.603
- A parkway too.

25:54.630 --> 25:56.226
- Yeah.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.211
- Well, I got a long drive ahead of me,

25:59.235 --> 26:00.235
the dinner was

26:01.050 --> 26:02.050
something,

26:02.728 --> 26:03.538
but he's out.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.276
- What, you're leaving?

26:05.300 --> 26:06.110
- Yep.

26:06.134 --> 26:07.216
- What about the addendum?

26:07.240 --> 26:08.050
- Codicil.

26:08.074 --> 26:09.396
- Is a what now?

26:09.420 --> 26:11.146
- Codicil, your add or evoke changes

26:11.170 --> 26:12.673
to an already existing will.

26:14.110 --> 26:15.106
- Never mind.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.466
- This,

26:16.490 --> 26:17.736
it's about all I can stand,

26:17.760 --> 26:19.156
besides, Will already left me

26:19.180 --> 26:21.766
his share of our parents
bungalow in Cape May,

26:21.790 --> 26:24.336
I'm gonna go out there and
I'm gonna sell that house,

26:24.360 --> 26:25.207
then I'm gonna have the bank

26:25.231 --> 26:27.176
convert that money into dollar bills,

26:27.200 --> 26:29.386
and I'm gonna roll around
in it for a little while,

26:29.410 --> 26:31.266
maybe build a little fort out of it,

26:31.290 --> 26:34.156
then I'm gonna go find young
bitches, with loose morals,

26:34.180 --> 26:37.736
who likes small unmarked bills.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.276
- What about Wendy?

26:39.300 --> 26:40.516
- That's gross.

26:40.540 --> 26:42.146
- She is distraught.

26:42.170 --> 26:43.696
- She's always distraught.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.536
She cries if they mess up
her order at Taco Bell,

26:46.560 --> 26:48.936
and she's my sister in law,

26:48.960 --> 26:50.786
and you know her, all right, Steve,

26:50.810 --> 26:52.206
so you got this, right?

26:52.230 --> 26:55.417
I trust you, Will trusted you, Wendy...

26:55.441 --> 26:57.076
No.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.446
- Wendy's sitting right over there,

26:58.470 --> 27:00.836
I'm sure she can handle all this bullshit,

27:00.860 --> 27:03.933
but as for me, goodnight,
goodbye and good luck.

27:08.195 --> 27:09.195
- What the hell!

27:21.385 --> 27:23.273
- Excuse me for a moment, please.

27:31.130 --> 27:32.836
- Would you stop antagonizing her?

27:32.860 --> 27:33.946
- I'm just keeping it real.

27:33.970 --> 27:34.780
- What?

27:34.804 --> 27:37.326
- I said, I'm keeping it real.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.506
- It is important to be yourself

27:39.530 --> 27:41.586
and not keep things bottled up.

27:41.610 --> 27:43.946
- Yes, but can we ride
the line a bit closer

27:43.970 --> 27:48.136
to a polite etiquette for
the grieving widow, and

27:48.160 --> 27:51.986
further from a stand up
comic parading a heckler.

27:52.010 --> 27:56.053
- Conflict can help us
confront unresolved issues

27:56.077 --> 27:58.556
in relationships.

27:58.580 --> 28:01.023
- Grieving widow, my ass!

28:02.270 --> 28:03.709
- Stop being an asshole.

28:03.733 --> 28:05.416
- Will you stop being
a whiny little bitch!

28:05.440 --> 28:07.786
- Name calling isn't productive.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.510
Lower your voice!

28:13.080 --> 28:14.433
- Sorry about that.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.226
- No problem just, we were,
- No problem.

28:17.250 --> 28:18.250
- Just chatting.

28:19.970 --> 28:22.303
- Does anyone care for fruit or dessert?

28:22.327 --> 28:23.505
- Oh.

28:39.726 --> 28:40.796
- You can't recycle that.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.106
- Why not?

28:42.130 --> 28:44.236
- Because the number's too high.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.970
- What does that mean?

28:45.994 --> 28:48.166
- There's a little number
inside the triangle,

28:48.190 --> 28:50.280
and in this case it's a five.

28:50.304 --> 28:53.656
take five, so
it has to go in the trash.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.906
- That's bullshit.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.176
- That's the rule.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.596
- Did you make the dessert

29:04.620 --> 29:08.076
with the fermented grapes in
the watermelon that I like?

29:08.100 --> 29:09.100
- No.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.113
- So Dave, what happened here?

29:15.390 --> 29:16.277
- Life son!

29:16.301 --> 29:17.983
It's a hard world out there.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.926
- Well, I meant the cane.

29:20.950 --> 29:22.856
- Oh, I got shot in the foot.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.456
What?

29:24.480 --> 29:26.546
- I got shot in the foot.

29:26.570 --> 29:28.656
- How the hell did that happen?

29:28.680 --> 29:29.796
- Hey, you know, there was a

29:29.820 --> 29:32.306
robbery at the grocery
store and I was there.

29:32.330 --> 29:34.796
- Holy shit, that was you.

29:34.820 --> 29:38.198
- Yeah, you know, I'm a
pretty much a superstar hero.

29:38.222 --> 29:42.056
It hurt, you know, but
whatever, I gotta lick in.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.116
So, I'm standing in the grocery store,

29:44.140 --> 29:45.676
minding my own business,

29:45.700 --> 29:49.526
and pondering the world of
pickled cucumber delights,

29:49.550 --> 29:52.589
when all of a sudden, a
masked maniac bursts in

29:52.613 --> 29:53.886
yelling and screaming

29:53.910 --> 29:57.516
as he brandishes his phallic
weapon at the innocent.

29:57.540 --> 30:00.286
Women and children shuttered in terror,

30:00.310 --> 30:03.466
while the men found themselves
covered in their own urine,

30:03.490 --> 30:05.566
collecting in perfect circles

30:05.590 --> 30:08.416
between their unweathered boat shoes.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.356
An elderly man powered by a
sudden surge of adrenaline

30:12.380 --> 30:15.176
was spry and seemed ready to intervene,

30:15.200 --> 30:19.326
but instead, dove for cover
behind a yellow mustard display.

30:19.350 --> 30:23.116
Greatest Generation my ass.

30:23.140 --> 30:27.206
Meanwhile, the nefarious villain
was all, "Hands in the air"

30:27.230 --> 30:30.506
as he came directly into
my fields of attack.

30:30.530 --> 30:34.796
A vile view of a fallen man,
it was as terrible as the dawn

30:34.820 --> 30:36.886
treacherous as the seas.

30:36.910 --> 30:40.446
He stood at the head of the
aisle with his back to me,

30:40.470 --> 30:44.266
and I took up in my hands,
the mighty jar condiment

30:44.290 --> 30:47.913
and rained down delicious
justice upon his crown.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.466
- So, you hit the guy.

30:50.490 --> 30:52.756
- Yeah, you know, I hit
him with the jar pickles.

30:52.780 --> 30:53.916
- You what?

30:53.940 --> 30:56.236
- They didn't mention that
in the news, did they?

30:56.260 --> 30:59.001
Yeah, you know, this guy was
all like, "Hands in the air",

30:59.025 --> 31:00.946
you know, but his back was turned,

31:00.970 --> 31:03.846
so I smashed him in the head
with the jar of pickles.

31:03.870 --> 31:05.696
You know, his gun went off
a couple of times though

31:05.720 --> 31:07.236
and he got me in the foot.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.286
Actually kind of a shame,

31:09.310 --> 31:11.206
it was a really good jar of pickles.

31:11.230 --> 31:13.326
You know, the deal kind?

31:13.350 --> 31:14.406
- Pretty lucky.

31:14.430 --> 31:18.206
- Yeah, I think the word
that the cops used was brave,

31:18.230 --> 31:19.130
but yeah.

31:19.154 --> 31:20.267
- What if you had missed?

31:20.291 --> 31:22.066
What if he had pointed
the gun up instead of down

31:22.090 --> 31:23.236
and shot you in the head?

31:23.260 --> 31:26.586
You put yourself and everyone
in that store in danger.

31:26.610 --> 31:27.736
- I couldn't just stand around

31:27.760 --> 31:29.710
and wait for somebody else to get hurt.

31:30.730 --> 31:32.236
- Tom's a psychiatrist,

31:32.260 --> 31:34.536
so I'll leave the analyzing to him.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.136
Steve, Steve's a lawyer, so

31:37.160 --> 31:39.196
he's my go to guy for legal advice.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.026
When I'd like to stop somebody

31:41.050 --> 31:43.626
from committing a criminal act,

31:43.650 --> 31:45.366
I'd rather wait for the cops

31:45.390 --> 31:48.766
than some guy who stacks
shelves in a toy store.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.526
- That's not unreasonable.

31:50.550 --> 31:51.726
- You're just jealous

31:51.750 --> 31:54.206
that I Batman the shit out of that guy.

31:54.230 --> 31:55.706
- You could have killed him.

31:55.730 --> 31:56.746
- He could have killed me.

31:56.770 --> 31:57.657
- Yeah, well,

31:57.681 --> 32:01.466
I think you're both making
some very valid points here,

32:01.490 --> 32:05.316
I mean, Wendy is talking about

32:05.340 --> 32:08.076
the dangers of vigilantism,
which is very valid,

32:08.100 --> 32:08.910
whereas Dave...

32:08.934 --> 32:12.276
- My point is that I'm Batman,

32:12.300 --> 32:14.306
and if anyone points a gun at me,

32:14.330 --> 32:16.506
they have my permission to die.

32:16.530 --> 32:17.746
- You said his back was to you.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.853
- Yeah, you know, same difference.

32:22.010 --> 32:23.736
- Isn't that how

32:23.760 --> 32:24.776
Will died?

32:24.800 --> 32:27.989
I mean, not the armed robbery guy,

32:30.010 --> 32:33.646
I don't, I'm sorry, I was
out of town when it happened

32:33.670 --> 32:36.223
and I had to leave
right after the service.

32:36.247 --> 32:37.884
- Yes,

32:37.908 --> 32:39.043
it was

32:39.067 --> 32:40.363
a blow to the head.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.666
- Blunt force trauma.

32:42.690 --> 32:43.823
- I get it, McCoy.

32:43.847 --> 32:45.306
- But how?

32:45.330 --> 32:49.188
How did it come to pass
that he was hit in the head?

32:49.212 --> 32:50.820
- I'm sorry,

32:50.844 --> 32:51.844
excuse me.

32:55.645 --> 32:56.923
- Jesus.

34:00.877 --> 34:03.950
- Well, if everyone's
done with dessert, we can

34:04.840 --> 34:07.390
make ourselves more
comfortable in the living room.

34:19.540 --> 34:22.123
Can I get anyone anything else?

34:22.969 --> 34:24.295
- Could we just do this thing now?

34:24.320 --> 34:25.565
- Dave!

34:25.590 --> 34:26.913
- No, he's right.

34:27.850 --> 34:31.248
I'll go get the document.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.826
- Big money, big money,
big money, big money

34:34.850 --> 34:36.295
and Wendy's stop!

34:36.320 --> 34:38.862
- Lower your goddamn voice.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.505
- Don't act like you don't need the money.

34:41.530 --> 34:43.146
- I need the money.

34:43.170 --> 34:45.116
Of course, I need the money,
we all need the money,

34:45.139 --> 34:46.376
Will knows

34:46.400 --> 34:50.159
that we needed money, presumably
why he left us some money.

34:50.183 --> 34:51.525
- I thought Will lost all his money.

34:51.550 --> 34:52.974
- Lower your voice.

34:56.630 --> 34:58.593
- Well, here it is.

35:04.740 --> 35:05.736
I am,

35:05.760 --> 35:08.316
I think Wayne preferred, you do the honors

35:08.340 --> 35:11.016
and I certainly have no objection.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.486
- Be happy to.

35:12.510 --> 35:16.513
I mean, I'm not happy to
read your dead husband's Will

35:16.537 --> 35:19.498
addendum, codicil.

35:20.580 --> 35:21.580
Let's begin.

35:30.020 --> 35:30.830
- Sorry.

35:30.854 --> 35:32.993
- All right, from the desk of William.

35:34.790 --> 35:37.996
Greetings friends, if you're reading this,

35:38.020 --> 35:41.066
I'm dead or missing

35:41.090 --> 35:43.973
or in a coma with no chance
of regaining consciousness.

35:44.950 --> 35:49.476
Anyway, if you're mourning
for me, thanks. that's nice.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.726
If not, that's okay, too,

35:51.750 --> 35:55.006
it's not as though you can
hurt my feelings at this point.

35:55.030 --> 35:56.136
I'm sure you're wondering why

35:56.160 --> 35:58.136
I brought you all here tonight,

35:58.160 --> 36:00.936
instead of bequeathing through
the standard procedure,

36:00.960 --> 36:02.166
but as you know,

36:02.190 --> 36:04.766
I've had quite a bit of
trouble with the authorities,

36:04.790 --> 36:07.066
and I felt that some
things were better left

36:07.090 --> 36:08.653
below board, if you will.

36:09.880 --> 36:12.406
So, that's why now,

36:12.430 --> 36:15.246
I should explain why you,

36:15.270 --> 36:17.586
you five specifically,

36:17.610 --> 36:19.756
Wayne, my beloved brother,

36:19.780 --> 36:20.783
and Wendy,

36:21.780 --> 36:22.780
my wife,

36:24.050 --> 36:27.286
Tom and Steve, my oldest friends,

36:27.310 --> 36:28.916
and of course,

36:28.940 --> 36:32.846
Dave, the best roommate
any co Ed could ask for.

36:32.870 --> 36:34.739
- Lambda, lambda, lambda, bitches.

36:35.770 --> 36:36.580
- I've asked you all here

36:36.604 --> 36:38.940
to participate in something
of a treasure hunt.

36:43.090 --> 36:44.676
Again, because of the IRS,

36:44.700 --> 36:47.036
trusting such a thing as this to a bank,

36:47.060 --> 36:49.963
or a lawyer, no offense, Steve,

36:50.890 --> 36:52.283
didn't seem prudent.

36:53.550 --> 36:55.796
I have left this last gift to all of you

36:55.820 --> 36:57.076
and have hidden it safely

36:57.100 --> 37:00.166
within the confines of these walls.

37:00.190 --> 37:02.306
I dare not mentioned the exact location,

37:02.330 --> 37:05.263
lest this document should
fall into the wrong hands,

37:06.870 --> 37:10.636
but rest assured, if you all work together

37:10.660 --> 37:13.086
and use the memories of
time well spent here,

37:13.110 --> 37:14.910
you'll find what you're looking for.

37:16.350 --> 37:17.736
Good luck to you all,

37:17.760 --> 37:21.926
but you should probably burn
this because again, the IRS.

37:21.950 --> 37:24.003
Excelsior, Will.

37:28.030 --> 37:32.176
- So, there's money hidden in my house?

37:32.200 --> 37:33.716
- That's what it sounds like.

37:33.740 --> 37:34.856
- And it doesn't say where?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.956
- No, I read the whole thing,

37:36.980 --> 37:38.516
fine tooth comb.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.496
- But is there like a picture
in there or something,

37:40.520 --> 37:43.375
like of the faucet with the
snake on it in "Harry Potter"?

37:44.250 --> 37:45.060
- That's it.

37:45.084 --> 37:46.536
- Well, we have to start looking for it,

37:46.560 --> 37:47.736
we have no other choice.

37:47.760 --> 37:50.176
- Well, I can't think of anything.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.976
- Then it's settled.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.563
Wendy, it's your house,
how should we proceed?

37:56.100 --> 37:58.216
- I think we can safely
eliminate the garage

37:58.240 --> 38:00.416
as Will never went in there,

38:00.440 --> 38:03.896
so, that leaves us with
just the house to search.

38:03.920 --> 38:08.706
So, I guess we just divide
up and start looking?

38:08.730 --> 38:09.547
- Yeah, you know what?

38:09.571 --> 38:13.116
I'll take the basement, all
right, lasers boo boo boo.

38:13.140 --> 38:14.776
- Okay, so that just leaves

38:14.800 --> 38:16.816
this floor in the attic to search.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.582
I prefer to search the bedrooms.

38:19.606 --> 38:20.660
- Yeah, right?

38:20.684 --> 38:23.486
'Cause it's your personal
stuff, personal private stuff,

38:23.510 --> 38:25.936
stuff that belongs to you, panties.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.606
Tom and I will look upstairs.

38:28.630 --> 38:29.946
- Great.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.436
- We'll check the attic.

38:31.460 --> 38:32.891
- Thank you.

38:41.230 --> 38:42.363
After you.

38:44.110 --> 38:45.316
- Why don't you go first.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.340
- Thanks, Tom.

38:50.371 --> 38:51.371
Holy shit.

38:52.610 --> 38:53.983
- Where should we start?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.750
- This side.

39:03.260 --> 39:06.245
- Jeez, there's a lot
of stuff in this attic.

39:06.269 --> 39:08.766
I could go through all this
all night with a fluoroscope

39:08.790 --> 39:10.736
and still not find anything.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.256
- We don't have all night,
let's just look real quick,

39:13.280 --> 39:15.646
so we can get right back to helping Wendy.

39:15.670 --> 39:17.989
- I'd rather she came up here to help us.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.186
- Did you hear that?

39:25.210 --> 39:26.187
- Hear What?

39:26.211 --> 39:27.756
- I don't know, let's just keep looking.

39:27.780 --> 39:29.966
- What are we looking for?

39:29.990 --> 39:32.686
- Are you aware that I know
everything that you know,

39:32.710 --> 39:35.250
it's probably just a
lockbox or a portable safe.

40:36.663 --> 40:38.041
- I found.

40:38.065 --> 40:39.065
- What?

40:39.986 --> 40:41.102
- A lightsaber.

40:41.126 --> 40:41.936
- Oh,

40:41.960 --> 40:43.380
does it work?

40:45.690 --> 40:46.500
- It does.

40:46.524 --> 40:48.236
- I'll call Dave.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.916
- We're never gonna find
anything in all this mess,

40:50.940 --> 40:53.796
let's just go find Wendy,
see what she suggests.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.010
- All right.

41:02.451 --> 41:03.261
- Open the door.

41:03.285 --> 41:04.937
- I'm trying.

41:04.961 --> 41:06.604
- What?
- It's locked.

41:06.628 --> 41:08.736
- How the hell did that happen?

41:08.760 --> 41:09.863
- I have no idea!

41:15.120 --> 41:16.120
- Okay.

41:19.690 --> 41:21.106
- How are we gonna get out of here?

41:21.130 --> 41:22.306
- I'll call Dave.

41:22.330 --> 41:23.430
- No, I'll call Wendy.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.876
Hi,

41:26.900 --> 41:27.900
find any goodies?

41:32.700 --> 41:35.416
So, funny story, Tom and
I are up to the attic

41:35.440 --> 41:36.593
and the door is locked.

41:39.410 --> 41:41.636
Okay, we'll see in a bit.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.206
guess this is what it's like,

41:43.230 --> 41:44.426
we don't know how that happened,

41:44.450 --> 41:46.283
bye.

41:47.850 --> 41:48.850
On a shmuck, Tom.

41:55.810 --> 41:57.200
- Hey, ham.

42:05.300 --> 42:06.109
- Thanks.

42:06.133 --> 42:07.133
- Yeah.

42:10.650 --> 42:12.876
- I am so sorry about that,

42:12.900 --> 42:15.076
it's a twistlock doorknob,

42:15.100 --> 42:16.956
so you gotta be careful with that.

42:16.980 --> 42:19.076
- Yeah, could have sworn
that we left it open.

42:19.100 --> 42:19.909
- Yeah.

42:19.933 --> 42:20.743
- Yeah, whatever,

42:20.767 --> 42:21.900
hand me the lightsaber.

42:25.070 --> 42:26.246
Hmm,

42:26.270 --> 42:28.116
late 90s,

42:28.140 --> 42:29.363
vintage,

42:31.580 --> 42:33.173
Phantom Menace line.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.246
Quite a g-model,

42:36.270 --> 42:37.270
hmm.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.576
Hmm, still works.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.750
Where did you get this?

42:43.880 --> 42:45.173
- You gave it to Will.

42:46.140 --> 42:47.140
- Oh, did I?

42:47.850 --> 42:48.740
- Well, any luck up there?

42:48.764 --> 42:51.113
- There's a lot of stuff up there.

42:53.310 --> 42:56.736
- Yeah, we were hoping that maybe you can

42:56.760 --> 42:58.146
give us the cliff notes.

42:58.170 --> 42:59.536
- Bet it was a long shot anyway,

42:59.560 --> 43:01.233
Will never went up there.

43:02.770 --> 43:04.396
So, should we keep looking?

43:04.420 --> 43:05.813
- Yeah, time is money, money's time.

43:05.837 --> 43:07.536
Let's go.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.996
Let's all keep looking.

43:09.020 --> 43:09.830
Get back to work.

43:09.854 --> 43:12.446
- I'm done with the attic.

43:12.470 --> 43:14.426
Mind if I join you?

43:14.450 --> 43:15.536
- Yeah, sure, why not?

43:15.560 --> 43:17.106
- That's okay, I'll stay

43:17.130 --> 43:19.276
and cover the nuts and crannies up there.

43:19.300 --> 43:20.109
You sure?

43:20.133 --> 43:21.097
- Yeah, I'm good, I got this.

43:21.121 --> 43:24.936
- Okay, well, if you need
anything, give us a call.

43:24.960 --> 43:25.770
- Will do.

43:25.794 --> 43:27.896
- Lasers, boo boo boo.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.420
- Don't you mean laser swords?

43:30.380 --> 43:33.226
- Yeah, well, you know, I
love to sit around all night

43:33.250 --> 43:35.286
and talk about the "Star
Wars" prequels, but you know,

43:35.310 --> 43:36.696
we get into "Phantom Menace",

43:36.720 --> 43:38.426
we'll be here all day and
night, you know what I mean?

43:38.450 --> 43:39.286
- Fair enough.

43:39.310 --> 43:40.310
- Alright.

43:48.430 --> 43:50.156
- So, how far did you get?

43:50.180 --> 43:51.246
- Not very.

43:51.270 --> 43:52.690
I found some of his booze

43:53.560 --> 43:54.906
and a lot of workout magazines

43:54.930 --> 43:57.086
and Richard Simmons workout videos.

43:57.110 --> 43:58.716
- Yeah, he was

43:58.740 --> 44:00.106
into

44:00.130 --> 44:01.386
stuff.

44:01.410 --> 44:02.410
- Yeah.

44:04.330 --> 44:05.187
Hey, I got an idea,

44:05.211 --> 44:06.996
maybe he howled out a
book and hid cash in it,

44:07.020 --> 44:09.196
like in "The Shawshank Redemption"?

44:09.220 --> 44:10.336
You ever see that movie?

44:10.360 --> 44:12.186
- It's on TV every weekend.

44:12.210 --> 44:13.636
- Ah, yeah.

44:13.660 --> 44:14.860
Well, let's look anyway.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.866
- This is so fucking stupid.

44:25.890 --> 44:27.096
- Yeah, you have a better idea?

44:27.120 --> 44:29.859
- Not really, we don't even
know what we're looking for.

44:29.883 --> 44:31.416
- What do you mean?

44:31.440 --> 44:33.956
- What do you expect to
find, a cashier's check,

44:33.980 --> 44:36.086
a lot of hundred dollar bills?

44:36.110 --> 44:37.666
- Yes.

44:37.690 --> 44:38.657
- That would be nice.

44:38.681 --> 44:40.806
- It'd be better than nice.

44:40.830 --> 44:42.346
An injection of cash is just what I need

44:42.370 --> 44:43.686
to save my business.

44:43.710 --> 44:45.126
- I know what you mean.

44:45.150 --> 44:46.506
My father's medical expenses

44:46.530 --> 44:48.383
are really spiraling out of control,

44:49.240 --> 44:50.340
I'm pretty much broke.

44:51.410 --> 44:52.410
- Yeah, me too.

44:54.240 --> 44:56.116
Like, you know, what, Tom?

44:56.140 --> 44:58.876
A day may come when we have
to give up our businesses

44:58.900 --> 45:00.596
and start working at Walmart,

45:00.620 --> 45:04.426
but it is not this day,
a day may come where

45:04.450 --> 45:07.396
we will give up looking
for money we didn't earn,

45:07.420 --> 45:10.056
but it is not this day.

45:10.080 --> 45:13.756
A day may come when we will
say fuck it, let's go to a bar,

45:13.780 --> 45:16.476
but it is not this day,

45:16.500 --> 45:20.985
this day we look, look for
money, join me shrink road head,

45:21.009 --> 45:22.009
join me.

45:35.838 --> 45:36.838
- Hello.

45:38.250 --> 45:39.250
- Hello.

45:40.490 --> 45:43.113
- Tom is helping Dave in the basement

45:43.137 --> 45:44.966
and the attic is just a bus,

45:44.990 --> 45:47.353
so I was wondering if you
needed any help in here.

45:48.700 --> 45:49.700
- Oh,

45:51.180 --> 45:53.393
yeah, sure, that would be great.

45:54.900 --> 45:58.237
Would you mind going through this box?

45:58.261 --> 45:59.296
- Sure.

45:59.320 --> 46:02.180
- That's some of local
papers and things but

46:03.112 --> 46:04.106
I mean, you never know, right?

46:04.130 --> 46:05.771
- Right, right.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.533
- Sure will be nice when
this is all over, huh.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.876
- Ready to put this behind you, huh?

46:22.900 --> 46:23.900
- Yeah,

46:24.890 --> 46:28.626
not to mention the fact that
I desperately need the money.

46:28.650 --> 46:29.650
- Right, right.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.476
- I mean, who knows if it'll
even be enough to cover

46:33.500 --> 46:35.988
all the debt that Will left me with.

46:36.012 --> 46:37.236
- There's a lot of them.

46:37.260 --> 46:39.014
- There's tons.

46:39.038 --> 46:41.083
I mean, the funeral alone.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.456
If I could just get this money

46:44.480 --> 46:47.110
and get things settled, you know, I could

46:50.240 --> 46:51.923
move on with my life.

46:55.673 --> 46:57.793
- I don't even feel like
mine's even gotten started.

46:59.060 --> 47:01.416
- But, you're a lawyer,

47:01.440 --> 47:03.590
that's like, the quintessential

47:04.450 --> 47:06.672
symbol for success.

47:06.696 --> 47:08.366
You have to become a doctor too

47:08.390 --> 47:10.063
then will you feel accomplished?

47:11.320 --> 47:13.440
- No, it's just, I feel like

47:14.740 --> 47:17.946
the weight of the world is
on my shoulders with the

47:17.970 --> 47:20.213
practice and the finances and

47:21.080 --> 47:22.563
it's holding me back,

47:23.540 --> 47:24.540
keeping me

47:25.350 --> 47:26.593
from what I really want.

47:28.420 --> 47:29.776
- Steve...

47:29.800 --> 47:30.906
- Wendy?

47:30.930 --> 47:32.976
- Yeah, Tom, what is it?

47:33.000 --> 47:34.666
- Wendy, it just hit me,

47:34.690 --> 47:37.396
what if the money is
buried in the backyard,

47:37.420 --> 47:38.603
is that possible?

47:39.815 --> 47:42.923
- Yes, that's a great idea, Tom,

47:42.947 --> 47:44.047
why don't we go check,

47:45.290 --> 47:48.199
absolutely, that is a brilliant,

47:48.223 --> 47:50.106
brilliant idea.

47:50.130 --> 47:55.130
Why don't you head on out there
and see what you can find.

47:55.540 --> 47:56.540
- Whoa, good.

48:27.522 --> 48:28.806
- To Roger Maris,

48:28.830 --> 48:32.493
still the all American
single season homerun king.

48:36.883 --> 48:39.576
Well, to Ruth and to Mantle,

48:39.600 --> 48:40.410
I'm glad you're not here

48:40.434 --> 48:43.170
'cause you can both drink
beer under the table.

48:58.006 --> 49:00.256
Oh, and here's the you kid.

49:38.750 --> 49:40.250
Holy potato balls!

49:42.930 --> 49:44.023
I missed your mom,

49:45.510 --> 49:46.510
I'm full house,

49:47.430 --> 49:48.803
I'm ghost dad.

49:51.933 --> 49:52.933
Fuck!

50:08.210 --> 50:10.096
- The money is here, I know it's here

50:10.120 --> 50:14.466
buried in the backyard, I
know it, I can smell it.

50:14.490 --> 50:15.886
I'll just slip out the gate,

50:15.910 --> 50:19.846
walk up the driveway, get
in the car and drive away.

50:26.090 --> 50:27.976
But then they'll know.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.126
Know what?

50:29.150 --> 50:31.966
If we just leave, they'll
know we took the money.

50:31.990 --> 50:32.800
We?

50:32.824 --> 50:34.896
Were in this together.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.326
I need the money,

50:36.350 --> 50:38.196
I can't afford to share it with them.

50:38.220 --> 50:39.676
We need the money,

50:39.700 --> 50:42.196
and I'm the one who can help you find it.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.676
You know where it is?

50:43.700 --> 50:45.296
How?

50:45.320 --> 50:49.116
Just start digging, we
can do this together.

50:49.140 --> 50:51.743
Yes, I'll start right now.

50:53.520 --> 50:56.886
Good, dig, dig,

50:56.910 --> 50:57.910
dig it all.

51:02.930 --> 51:03.740
- Wendy.

51:03.764 --> 51:06.780
- I know what you're going to say, and

51:08.058 --> 51:09.058
at the moment,

51:09.970 --> 51:13.516
things being as they are, it just seems

51:13.540 --> 51:14.722
impossible.

51:14.746 --> 51:16.452
- You're right.

51:16.476 --> 51:17.886
You're right.

51:17.910 --> 51:19.520
If only I had the money.

51:19.544 --> 51:21.667
- If I had the money.

51:21.691 --> 51:23.982
- If we could have the money.

- I will be right back,

55:30.290 --> 55:32.176
just one second.

55:51.025 --> 55:53.433
It's almost over, I can do this.

56:16.280 --> 56:18.646
Are you stretching?

56:18.670 --> 56:20.036
- Yeah,

56:20.060 --> 56:21.506
yeah, doing a little

56:21.530 --> 56:24.916
stretching stressful situations,
you know, you tense up,

56:24.940 --> 56:27.756
I'm seeing a chiropractor for a while

56:27.780 --> 56:31.576
stretching because you
can never be too careful

56:31.600 --> 56:33.626
with your body tensing
up in tense situations

56:33.650 --> 56:36.267
and I'm also in an archery class now.

57:29.110 --> 57:32.186
- Oh, Zod, you crazy bastard.

57:39.020 --> 57:40.076
Yellow.

57:40.100 --> 57:41.246
- Hey, man,

57:41.270 --> 57:43.646
I'm digging up the yard,
come out and help me.

57:43.670 --> 57:44.970
- Yeah, I can't, I'm busy.

57:46.600 --> 57:47.906
- With what?

57:47.930 --> 57:52.046
- I'm watching "Superman Two" on VHS.

57:52.070 --> 57:54.976
- Dude, the money might be back here.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.096
- This lady, right, she calls
out Superman for being Jewish,

57:58.120 --> 58:00.463
like, he's Frederick
Superman or something.

58:02.010 --> 58:03.010
Idiot.

58:03.910 --> 58:06.036
- I could really use a hand.
- Yeah, how about this?

58:06.060 --> 58:09.206
You keep looking outside,
I'll keep looking inside,

58:09.230 --> 58:11.596
and we'll be looking at
two spots at the same time.

58:11.620 --> 58:12.430
Sounds good?
- No, no, no.

58:12.454 --> 58:15.266
- Great, all right, buddy,

58:15.290 --> 58:17.090
all right, take care.
- No, seriously, stop...

58:24.443 --> 58:25.466
Come on, lady,

58:25.490 --> 58:27.856
You know Clark head, you know, Superman,

58:27.880 --> 58:30.286
you're standing four feet
away from both of them,

58:30.310 --> 58:32.166
I mean, they're just glasses, okay,

58:32.190 --> 58:33.701
It's not a loo to door mask.

58:35.550 --> 58:36.550
Man.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.440
Oh, my God.

58:47.100 --> 58:48.929
Oh, my God, I'm drunk.

59:02.460 --> 59:03.460
- Hello, Dave.

59:04.460 --> 59:05.616
- Yo.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.616
- What are you doing down here?

59:07.640 --> 59:09.336
- Looking for the money?

59:09.360 --> 59:12.466
- I think we should talk about that.

59:12.490 --> 59:13.600
- Okay.

59:16.420 --> 59:17.420
Let's talk.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.086
What do you wanna talk about?

59:22.110 --> 59:25.526
- I think you have some
very definite ideas

59:25.550 --> 59:28.406
about what should be done with the money.

59:28.430 --> 59:30.676
- We should all split it, right?

59:30.700 --> 59:32.296
- When should we split it?

59:32.320 --> 59:33.746
- As soon as possible.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.286
You do see what we're doing here, right?

59:35.310 --> 59:36.577
You get it, right?

59:37.625 --> 59:39.936
- But you gonna sweat it.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.186
That's great,

59:41.210 --> 59:45.356
but have you ever thought
about my responsibilities?

59:45.380 --> 59:47.456
Have you ever thought
about my responsibilities

59:47.480 --> 59:48.387
to my daughter?

59:48.411 --> 59:50.416
Do you have any idea

59:50.440 --> 59:54.566
what a moral or ethical
principle is, do you?

59:54.590 --> 59:56.196
- I never thought I'd say this to anyone,

59:56.220 --> 59:59.216
but you sound way too
much like me, right now.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.050
Give me the bat, Wendy.

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:01.556
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.836
- Give me the bat, Wendy.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.956
- You didn't let me finish my sentence.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:08.196
I am not going to hurt you, I'm just...

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.426
- To bash my brains in.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:11.193
- No, Jesus Christ, no!

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.130
But I am gonna hurt you real bad,

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.730
for the best.

01:00:26.447 --> 01:00:31.419
Hold that thought, we should
probably move the table.

01:00:31.443 --> 01:00:32.270
- Okay, I'll move it.
- Would you grab,

01:00:32.294 --> 01:00:34.697
grab that part of the table.

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:35.976
- I don't break the table.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.250
- Don't touch my candles.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.216
- Which way am I turning?

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.898
- Go that way.

01:00:41.922 --> 01:00:42.877
- This way?

01:00:42.901 --> 01:00:45.163
- Follow my lead, go that way.

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:48.169
Where are you going, where
are you going with this?

01:00:48.193 --> 01:00:49.466
- I can't fit through
with my hands like this.

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.116
- You don't need...

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.226
- I just gotta put my hands
down so I can get in, okay?

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.886
- How are you gonna get out now?

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:57.326
- It's fine, I'll figure it out.

01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:58.336
- Seems unnecessary.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.247
- I'm gonna go over the couch.

01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:01.494
- Don't go over the the
couch in your shoes,

01:01:01.518 --> 01:01:03.038
don't go over the couch in your shoes.

01:01:03.876 --> 01:01:04.876
Jesus!

01:01:08.386 --> 01:01:10.126
keep it off the fabric.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:11.793
- Okay, I'm fine.

01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:16.603
- Pick up your thing.

01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:18.756
Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.002
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:01:20.026 --> 01:01:21.040
- Okay.

01:01:43.702 --> 01:01:45.109
Okay,

01:01:45.133 --> 01:01:46.236
okay.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.826
We don't have to split it with the others,

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:50.056
we could share it between ourselves.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.133
- I'll never share anything with you.

01:01:52.157 --> 01:01:54.406
- Didn't you hear what Steve read?

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:56.326
We have to share it.

01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:58.581
I am your partner.

01:01:58.605 --> 01:02:00.741
No!

01:02:03.729 --> 01:02:05.136
- My kingdom for pickle jar.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.476
Help, help me Steve, help, help.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.246
- I don't think Steve will
be coming to your rescue,

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:11.963
I've seen to that.

01:02:11.987 --> 01:02:13.652
- You monster.

01:02:13.676 --> 01:02:16.753
- I'm just a mother
providing for her daughter.

01:02:18.858 --> 01:02:20.323
Oh,

01:02:20.347 --> 01:02:21.347
oh,

01:02:22.588 --> 01:02:23.588
oh.

01:02:35.272 --> 01:02:36.272
Aww.

01:02:38.498 --> 01:02:39.498
Oh.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.004
Bitch.

01:02:43.028 --> 01:02:43.837
Help!

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:44.671
- Dave.

01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:45.895
Help, someone please.

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:50.377
- Dave, oh, God, oh God,

01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:52.176
I'm coming, Dave.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.349
Yeah.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.223
- Siri, call Tom.

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:15.166
Calling Tom.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.420
- Thank you Sweety.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.646
- Yeah, hello.

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.692
- Tom, get in here, Wendy
is trying to kill me.

01:03:29.716 --> 01:03:30.913
What?

01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:33.521
- She is baseball batting
the hell out of me.

01:03:33.545 --> 01:03:34.790
- I'm coming.

01:03:39.169 --> 01:03:40.169
Damn.

01:03:45.199 --> 01:03:46.199
Damn.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.840
Damn.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.727
It's locked,

01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:56.759
do you know any tricks
for opening locked doors.

01:03:56.783 --> 01:03:59.306
Yeah, use the
key, hurry the fuck up.

01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:01.066
- Let them kill each other,

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:02.976
then the money is ours.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.116
No, they're my friends and

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.956
I've gotta help them,

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:10.746
and if you don't understand that,

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:14.923
you're nothing at all, nothing at all.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:23.893
I'm coming, Dave, I'm coming to save you.

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:27.326
Damn it.

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.899
I guess I'll just have to break it down.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.580
That hurt.

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:42.906
- Admit it,

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.656
say it just once,

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.883
that I am Dana's father.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.493
- I will never join you.

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:50.739
- What?

01:04:54.921 --> 01:04:56.059
- Dave.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.436
- Will was gay, wasn't he?

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.236
You didn't think I was
ready to be a father,

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.296
so, you posed as his
wife to help his career.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.506
- You're a child, Dave,

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:33.033
you were a child back then
and you're still a child now.

01:05:44.696 --> 01:05:46.003
- Oh, I've been a fool,

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.156
only now at the end do I understand.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.393
- Oh, shut up!

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:54.726
- Where's Tom?

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.793
Oh my god.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.587
My faith in my friends
truly is my weakness.

01:06:03.386 --> 01:06:04.386
- No!

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.723
- Steve, you rescued me, thank goodness.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.386
What happened to your face?

01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.066
- Never mind that,

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.976
the point is we got to
get control of ourselves.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.113
Money isn't worth it.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.994
Don't think we're even
gonna find it at this point.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:27.146
- I'm starting to think
there never was any money.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:28.170
- You're kidding.

01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:30.136
- Well, he could have meant anything,

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.946
he never did specifically say

01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:33.806
that there was money in the addendum.

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:35.232
- Codicil.
- Whatever.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.823
I know you think I killed him.

01:06:42.270 --> 01:06:43.270
I didn't.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.040
You're right, our marriage was a sham, but

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.453
I didn't want him to die.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.350
He wasn't Dana's biological father, but

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:58.856
he was there when it counted, you know.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.336
We were the only people
in each other's lives,

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.650
who were really honest with each other.

01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:06.459
Now, I don't even have that.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.523
You and I,

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.806
us,

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:16.533
there was never going to be an us.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:22.573
I didn't want Dana to be
something tethering me to you,

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:24.530
when

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.616
we couldn't give each
other what we needed.

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:37.953
I haven't been able to
find a job in over a year.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.593
I loved that restaurant so much it was,

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:46.540
it was me, you know.

01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:53.176
And now I'm gonna lose this house,

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.483
and not just this house, everything.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:59.326
What about my daughter?

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.643
What am I supposed to tell her?

01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:03.139
What if.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.013
What if the state tries
to take her away from me?

01:08:07.645 --> 01:08:09.940
I have no family left, it's like

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:14.063
losing Will all over again.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:20.027
Will would have thought
of a way out of this.

01:08:20.885 --> 01:08:22.423
He did, I guess.

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.290
Will,

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:29.816
was always so preoccupied with work,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.506
and he could have sold it, the business,

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:35.853
he had an offer, he turned it down.

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:39.296
Finally, the chance came

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:44.292
to get out and get fat at the
same time and he let it go.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.763
He'd miss it too much, he said.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760
Can you imagine?

01:08:50.618 --> 01:08:51.969
That's what he really said?

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:54.886
What kind of a person,

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:59.603
what kind of a human being
loves being a trader?

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.426
People don't go to Wall Street,

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.676
because it's gonna be a lot of fun,

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.582
they go to make money.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.386
These people, they don't jump out of bed,

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:16.416
thinking about how much fun
it's gonna be to go to work,

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:17.975
they...

01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:19.786
I have been to parties with these people

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:21.520
and they're all so

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.080
miserable.

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:29.515
If all the money in the world and

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.546
doesn't mean anything to them,

01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:33.776
because they don't need it anymore,

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.683
they can't even think of what
to spend it on except junk.

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:44.036
It's a pointless, soulless job,

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.046
and the fact that Will actually enjoyed

01:09:49.069 --> 01:09:51.183
tricking these people out of their money,

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.293
it's very difficult to accept.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.946
You know, even after all that,

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:12.733
we still respected each other.

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.206
We've known each other for so long,

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.503
at some point that just
counts for something.

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:22.366
But I never would have hurt him

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:25.273
and he never would have hurt me.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.676
In the end, he just

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.316
said something stupid to
someone he owed money to,

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.296
got punched in the face,

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.070
fell hit his head on the ground and

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.906
the jerk that hit him
offered me a deal on the spot

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.053
to erase the debt.

01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:45.610
I just had to say

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:47.700
he was mugged.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:52.563
That's all it took.

01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:00.270
Not exactly the life I
pictured when we were kids.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:05.233
- Not for any of us.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800
- What do we do now?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.450
- I don't know about you,

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.186
but I am through looking for the money.

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:13.210
- What about

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.223
our dreams?

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
Our future?

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:20.540
What about us?

01:11:20.564 --> 01:11:22.176
- Steve,

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200
maybe,

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.023
maybe I'm not always honest with people.

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:33.853
Maybe you're not always
honest with yourself.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.620
- Yeah.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.620
Probably right about that.

01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:47.206
- You want some ice for your hand?

01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:48.230
- Please.

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.430
What?

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.156
Wait a second,

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.606
the World Series party.

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:55.596
What about it?

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.846
- I remember Will and I were talking about

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.816
the hiding money from the company, right,

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.579
and then Will said
something really peculiar.

01:12:03.603 --> 01:12:05.926
- I'd like to think I'm
ahead above the rest

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:08.009
when it comes to hiding things.

01:12:08.033 --> 01:12:10.036
- Totally.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.570
Totally.

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:12.600
Ahead

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.673
above the rest.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.516
- The drop ceiling.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.879
Will was always running
speaker wires through there.

01:12:28.952 --> 01:12:30.595
- Oh, baby!

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.518
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:44.573
It's a baseball card.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.895
- Son of a bitch!

01:12:48.919 --> 01:12:50.299
- Is that worth anything?

01:12:50.323 --> 01:12:52.986
- A couple hundred dollars
to the right buyer.

01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:54.010
- Jesus!

01:13:01.472 --> 01:13:03.818
- Then I guess I'm off
to the liquor store,

01:13:03.842 --> 01:13:05.380
liquor store, liquor store.

01:13:05.404 --> 01:13:06.993
- You get a cat?

01:13:07.017 --> 01:13:09.623
- No, I have no idea what that sound was.

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.006
- I'm happy with my situation.

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:16.167
Well, I got a long drive
ahead of me, he's out.

01:13:17.233 --> 01:13:18.712
- What, you're leaving?

01:13:18.736 --> 01:13:20.070
- Yep.

01:14:58.983 --> 01:14:59.983
- Jesus!

01:15:12.789 --> 01:15:13.599
- Yellow.

01:15:13.623 --> 01:15:14.626
- What do you know about this?

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:16.216
About what?

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.646
- Oh, come on, come on, the
baseball card, everything.

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:20.683
I heard a noise during dinner

01:15:20.707 --> 01:15:22.906
and you came back from the
liquor store few minutes later,

01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:25.696
it was you in the basement, wasn't it?

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.677
Maybe.

01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:29.726
- What else was in the box, Wayne?

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:30.919
- Look Wendy, do you
think it was an oversight

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.346
that my brother never
told you about the box?

01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:34.733
It wasn't.

01:15:34.757 --> 01:15:35.876
Blur, bluh, bluh, bluh.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.626
Water is still gonna water?

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:39.596
I know about your bastard kid.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.620
Later.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.100
Beep.

01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:45.906
- Son of a bitch!

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:47.013
- We could go to the police.

01:15:47.037 --> 01:15:48.366
- And say what?

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:50.356
- Oh, so I guess you can't complain about

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.307
someone stealing money

01:15:51.331 --> 01:15:53.330
that shouldn't exist in the first place.

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:55.440
- And that's it then.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.320
- Damn.

01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.353
- What am I gonna do now, I have nothing.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.765
- You have friends still and so does Dana.

01:16:05.789 --> 01:16:06.826
- Yeah,

01:16:06.850 --> 01:16:09.696
good friends, maybe not good
friends but people you know,

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.526
friends, MySpace friends list

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:13.709
from the entire area.

01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:14.733
- Shut up, Steve.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.746
- I'm ordering a couple bourbon

01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:25.796
as soon as I get through the door.

01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.136
- I'm ordering two drinks.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.396
- I'm going to literally
order every drink the bar has.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.616
- Alcohol is great for
solving life's problems.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.396
- Even in a bottle, yo, demon in a bottle.

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.906
- That reference is
only moderately obscure.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:42.233
- Your mom is moderately obscure.

01:16:44.959 --> 01:16:47.709
