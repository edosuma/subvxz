00:07.092 --> 00:09.160
(crickets chirping)

00:13.998 --> 00:16.000
(soft clattering)

00:26.277 --> 00:28.279
(door opens)

00:31.516 --> 00:32.717
CHASE:
Where is she?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.721
Where is she?

00:37.722 --> 00:39.790
(panting)

00:41.526 --> 00:44.129
Oh, no.
(moaning)

00:45.630 --> 00:47.298
No!

00:49.066 --> 00:50.401
Oh, no!

00:52.970 --> 00:54.805
-No.
-ABBEY: It's all right.

00:56.574 --> 00:58.576
W-We need to find her.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.478
No, we don't.

01:06.151 --> 01:08.085
Who-who are you?

01:08.153 --> 01:10.054
I'm the one you let in.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.258
I'm the one who let you in.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.595
I know who you are.

01:24.269 --> 01:25.770
I see you.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.373
I think we both know
that isn't true.

01:28.406 --> 01:30.608
(thunder crashes)

01:30.675 --> 01:32.910
-(soft chime)
-(woman speaking French on P.A.)

01:32.943 --> 01:34.779
(grunts)

01:34.845 --> 01:36.080
ZOE:
You okay?

01:36.113 --> 01:38.115
Yes.

01:43.288 --> 01:45.290
(compartment opens)

01:46.757 --> 01:48.759
(compartment closes)

01:50.428 --> 01:52.096
Write your name on there.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.099
-Why?
-Go on.

01:56.934 --> 01:57.935
Which one?

01:57.968 --> 02:00.070
Your real one.

02:00.104 --> 02:03.941
This is something
I used to do early on

02:03.941 --> 02:07.612
to help me get my head straight
before I stepped into a new op.

02:09.113 --> 02:12.650
Yeah, all right.
Now, put it in there.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.952
Yeah, go on, in the water.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.288
Yeah.

02:17.322 --> 02:20.625
Now, see, your name...

02:20.625 --> 02:22.560
is still in there somewhere.

02:23.794 --> 02:25.963
But it's got to let go
of you for a while,

02:25.996 --> 02:27.598
and you got to let go of it.

02:27.632 --> 02:28.766
Huh?

02:28.799 --> 02:30.801
When you walk out the door,

02:30.835 --> 02:32.803
it stays behind, you know?

02:32.837 --> 02:34.472
And you figure out a way

02:34.505 --> 02:37.074
to put it back together again
when it's time.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.483
Far be it from me to tell you
how to do your job,

02:45.516 --> 02:48.819
but that seems like
a problematic metaphor.

02:48.819 --> 02:49.987
Oh?

02:49.987 --> 02:52.457
This isn't reversible.

02:52.490 --> 02:53.791
In any way.

02:53.824 --> 02:58.028
Whate-Whatever this is,
it can't go back to what it was.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.001
Oh...

03:05.169 --> 03:06.271
I see.

03:07.171 --> 03:10.174
That's the price you pay
for your line of work.

03:11.342 --> 03:15.212
Um, that's the price you pay
for waking up in the morning.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.681
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Merci, monsieur.

03:17.682 --> 03:20.851
Everything's in free fall,
all the time.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.054
We're not wired
to cope with that,

03:24.121 --> 03:27.858
so we've all agreed to pretend
that it isn't happening.

03:27.892 --> 03:29.294
But it is.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.330
What about you?

03:32.363 --> 03:36.200
How different are you now
than you were then?

03:36.233 --> 03:40.004
Oh. You mean, now that, uh,
your life is in my hands,

03:40.037 --> 03:41.906
you're curious whether
I'm up to whatever

03:41.972 --> 03:44.309
we're gonna find out there?

03:47.312 --> 03:49.380
(chuckles)

03:50.247 --> 03:51.816
Ah.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.085
I guess we're about to find out.

03:58.923 --> 04:01.592
CHERYL:
I-I've never second-guessed

04:01.659 --> 04:03.093
about your work,

04:03.160 --> 04:04.562
and I'm not gonna start now.

04:04.595 --> 04:07.598
But this is bad, Harold.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.100
What are you hearing?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.736
That you aided and abetted

04:11.736 --> 04:14.071
the escape of a fugitive spy.

04:14.104 --> 04:17.207
And that you may have then
tried to have that spy murdered

04:17.241 --> 04:19.577
to prevent his capture.

04:20.578 --> 04:23.948
I mean, we've-we've seen people
ruined for less.

04:25.416 --> 04:28.453
Well, we've seen people
weather worse.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.588
Not whole.

04:30.621 --> 04:33.624
Not in any form
that we recognized after.

04:34.792 --> 04:37.428
A-A lawyer called this morning,

04:37.428 --> 04:40.931
and as he was telling me
how he could help us,

04:40.931 --> 04:44.268
I realized that this person
would be happy to take

04:44.301 --> 04:47.872
every cent that we have
to defend you.

04:48.806 --> 04:50.441
We've definitely seen that.

04:50.441 --> 04:51.942
I mean, that happens
all the time.

04:52.943 --> 04:54.612
And I looked at Henry.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.783
And it was all I could do
not to lose it.

04:58.783 --> 05:00.451
What'd you say to him?

05:00.451 --> 05:01.986
Oh, I didn't know what to say.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.622
I... I handed the phone off.

05:04.622 --> 05:05.890
You handed...

05:07.224 --> 05:08.325
Is your sister there?

05:08.393 --> 05:10.260
(sighs)
No.

05:10.294 --> 05:12.262
Hold on, he wants
to talk to you.

05:12.296 --> 05:13.464
Who?

05:23.641 --> 05:26.777
Harold, I came
as soon as I heard.

05:26.811 --> 05:28.446
Are you all right?

05:28.479 --> 05:30.481
Cheryl mentioned
it was a rough flight

05:30.481 --> 05:31.982
between you and Angela.

05:32.983 --> 05:34.852
Is my wife in the room with you?

05:34.919 --> 05:37.187
No, she's just gone
to put Henry to bed.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.322
Good.

05:38.355 --> 05:40.458
What the fuck
do you think happened?

05:40.491 --> 05:42.192
I see.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.328
You planted a mole in my office.

05:44.361 --> 05:45.663
You made me an accessory

05:45.696 --> 05:48.332
to I don't know
how many crimes.

05:48.365 --> 05:50.300
I gave you a daughter.

05:50.334 --> 05:53.137
That was the result.
I want to know the intent.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.373
What difference does the intent
make with that result?

05:56.441 --> 05:58.676
It makes some difference to me.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.513
Because he asked.

06:03.514 --> 06:06.884
Despite all he'd done,
I s... I still loved him.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.853
And he asked me

06:08.886 --> 06:11.055
to help him
protect his only child,

06:11.121 --> 06:12.857
so I did as he asked.

06:12.890 --> 06:15.893
The same as
I would have done for you.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.896
The same as I can do for you...

06:18.963 --> 06:20.364
now.

06:20.397 --> 06:22.066
You're gonna help me now?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.201
Ask me to fix this, Harold,

06:24.234 --> 06:25.570
and I will.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.037
How?

06:28.573 --> 06:32.342
I have always felt some
connection to those surgeons

06:32.376 --> 06:35.913
on the battlefields
of the Civil War.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.382
In the middle
of all that suffering,

06:38.415 --> 06:40.885
armed only with a saw
for the bone

06:40.885 --> 06:43.554
and dope for the pain,

06:43.588 --> 06:46.023
and asked

06:46.056 --> 06:48.058
to do the unthinkable--

06:48.092 --> 06:51.061
sever the parts
to save the whole.

06:51.095 --> 06:54.264
I've always felt
that is my profession too.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.567
To ignore the blood
and the wailing

06:56.567 --> 06:58.736
and decide what allows for

06:58.769 --> 07:01.606
the greatest possible good.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.074
It's what I taught you to do,

07:04.074 --> 07:08.078
so I imagine you can
see where this is going.

07:11.348 --> 07:15.085
If Angela Adams
is never heard from again,

07:15.085 --> 07:17.955
this can all be
laid at her feet.

07:18.022 --> 07:20.257
And you can be free of it.

07:20.290 --> 07:21.892
No.

07:21.926 --> 07:25.095
That identity may have been
born out of love,

07:25.129 --> 07:27.264
but it has become malignant.

07:27.264 --> 07:30.901
A danger to the things
it's connected to.

07:30.935 --> 07:33.771
Even the girl herself
might be saved,

07:33.771 --> 07:36.473
if she can separate
from the name.

07:36.541 --> 07:39.810
Out in the wild, maybe
she can find a way to recover.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.579
(door closes)

07:41.612 --> 07:44.749
I hear Cheryl returning.

07:44.782 --> 07:46.383
Tell me where you are.

07:48.619 --> 07:50.655
Ask me for my help...

07:51.789 --> 07:53.290
...and you will get it.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.469
Is everything all right at home?

08:05.502 --> 08:06.771
Yeah.

08:06.804 --> 08:09.273
It'll be a lot better
when I get back there.

08:09.306 --> 08:10.975
Yes, it will.

08:15.813 --> 08:17.815
-(indistinct chatter)
-(traffic driving past)

08:21.418 --> 08:23.487
-(boy calling out in Arabic)
-(bell tinkling)

08:38.669 --> 08:40.671
(speaks Arabic)

08:46.210 --> 08:47.945
I think you may be right.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.215
I'm always right.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.150
You're gonna have to be
more specific.

08:53.183 --> 08:54.685
Bote.

08:54.685 --> 08:56.687
That he might be slipping.

08:56.687 --> 08:59.056
I thought you said he was fine
when you sat with him.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.057
I did.

09:00.124 --> 09:02.159
Told myself he seemed fine.

09:02.192 --> 09:03.961
Told you he seemed fine.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.397
Been telling myself
he seemed fine

09:07.464 --> 09:10.034
over and over again,
all the way here.

09:11.368 --> 09:13.203
Then I'm realizing anything
I got to tell myself

09:13.237 --> 09:15.973
that many times maybe isn't
as true as I want it to be.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.475
Look, I get it.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.378
You've been through
a lot with him.

09:21.378 --> 09:23.380
So it makes sense
that you don't want to see

09:23.380 --> 09:25.883
that it may be all
coming to an end.

09:25.916 --> 09:27.885
I think that's the problem.

09:27.918 --> 09:29.887
It can't just come to an end.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.590
Everything comes to an end.

09:33.658 --> 09:34.859
Yeah,

09:34.892 --> 09:36.761
but someone's got to do
what he does.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.897
Keep an eye on the world
the way he does.

09:39.930 --> 09:42.066
Know the game the way he does.

09:43.768 --> 09:45.502
Who's gonna do it
if it isn't him?

09:47.337 --> 09:49.674
What he's asking of us here...

09:51.108 --> 09:52.743
...it's a lot to ask.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.447
And if he's wrong
about any part of it...

09:58.916 --> 10:00.417
...we're gonna be up
a fucking creek.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.194
(birds chirping)

10:16.433 --> 10:18.235
(speaking French)

10:18.268 --> 10:20.270
Monsieur.
Merci, monsieur.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.446
(door closes)

10:35.552 --> 10:37.621
(water running)

10:55.906 --> 10:57.975
*

11:09.486 --> 11:11.756
I need to understand
what this is.

11:15.659 --> 11:18.695
Yeah, all right.

11:18.763 --> 11:22.332
Well, this afternoon
is Pavlovich's reception.

11:22.332 --> 11:25.169
Now, we gain entrance.

11:25.169 --> 11:27.337
Uh, I-I make contact.
And then somehow--

11:27.371 --> 11:29.173
I don't know--
I convince him to help us.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.508
To kill Faraz Hamzad.

11:31.508 --> 11:33.543
-Yeah.
-I understand.

11:35.012 --> 11:37.181
But that is not what I meant.

11:37.214 --> 11:40.017
I want to understand
how your world works.

11:41.551 --> 11:43.187
Will you explain it to me?

11:50.194 --> 11:52.396
CHASE:
Lesson number one.

11:53.397 --> 11:56.200
All tradecraft is waged

11:56.233 --> 11:58.702
wielding two weapons in concert.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.339
In your left hand,

12:02.372 --> 12:04.909
uh, is your empathy.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.677
Your ability to read people,

12:07.711 --> 12:10.214
know what they want,
what they need.

12:10.247 --> 12:11.715
What they fear.

12:11.748 --> 12:13.984
What, uh, may give them hope.

12:14.919 --> 12:16.586
Cause them shame.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.490
And then, uh,
in your other hand...

12:22.326 --> 12:24.261
...you've got your ruthlessness.

12:26.430 --> 12:29.834
The willingness to use all that
insight against them, uh...

12:31.501 --> 12:33.070
And when both of those
two knives are sharp,

12:33.103 --> 12:35.906
you'd be amazed what
they can cut through.

12:35.940 --> 12:37.374
And that's something
you're taught?

12:37.407 --> 12:38.943
Mm-hmm.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.577
Well, a little bit.

12:40.610 --> 12:43.013
But I learned by doing, mostly.

12:44.081 --> 12:46.216
Emotionally carving
strangers to pieces

12:46.250 --> 12:48.919
through trial and error
sounds messy.

12:48.953 --> 12:51.521
-Ah, you have no idea.
-Don't I?

12:53.523 --> 12:54.925
Oh, do you?

12:56.126 --> 12:58.228
-The day we met.
-Mm-hmm.

12:58.262 --> 13:00.097
When you cooked for me,

13:00.097 --> 13:02.766
told me stories
and were charming,

13:02.799 --> 13:04.568
that's what you were doing,
wasn't it?

13:04.601 --> 13:07.604
Disassembling me
to see how I worked?

13:07.637 --> 13:10.975
Applying pressure to the seams

13:11.041 --> 13:13.377
so that I'd let you stay?

13:16.280 --> 13:17.781
Was it difficult?

13:18.782 --> 13:22.586
Was I difficult to
disassemble and manipulate?

13:22.619 --> 13:25.289
It's not really a
"hard or easy" kind of thing.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.959
Everyone's, you know,
wired so differently...

13:28.993 --> 13:32.129
-It's really a simple question.
-Yeah, not very hard.

13:34.064 --> 13:36.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.970
Okay.

13:39.970 --> 13:42.072
I really want to know
how to do this.

13:44.841 --> 13:46.510
You haven't, uh...

13:46.576 --> 13:48.845
heard the catch yet, though.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.480
Oh?
What's the catch?

13:50.480 --> 13:51.982
Uh, the catch...

13:53.483 --> 13:56.820
...is that once you turn it on
you can't turn it off.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.822
Ever.

14:00.257 --> 14:03.527
Now every time you meet someone,

14:03.593 --> 14:07.297
you get close to someone,
you lay eyes on them,

14:07.331 --> 14:09.666
you'll be thinking...

14:09.666 --> 14:12.669
how easy it would be
to use them, you know.

14:14.171 --> 14:17.007
Hurt 'em, discard them.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.211
And maybe you wonder if,
you know,

14:21.278 --> 14:23.613
maybe they're doing it
to you too, now.

14:24.614 --> 14:28.018
Maybe you can never really
trust anyone ever again.

14:37.962 --> 14:41.298
Still want me to go on?

14:43.733 --> 14:46.736
Well, friend, I haven't
really trusted anyone

14:46.803 --> 14:48.338
for a very long time,

14:48.372 --> 14:51.308
so why the fuck
would I want to start now?

15:07.391 --> 15:09.059
Lesson number two.

15:10.094 --> 15:12.429
When communications
are compromised,

15:12.496 --> 15:14.364
always have a reserve.

15:14.398 --> 15:17.367
Uh, Emily and I,
we share this account.

15:17.401 --> 15:19.903
Double digit primes on the left,

15:19.936 --> 15:21.905
that means she's okay.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.908
Crooked number that follows...

15:26.076 --> 15:28.412
...that means she's
on her way to my location.

15:34.784 --> 15:36.086
She's coming.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.460
HARPER:
You know, there's
a pretty good chance that

15:43.527 --> 15:46.763
he's not terribly
happy to see me.

15:46.796 --> 15:48.465
This is gonna be a lot less

15:48.532 --> 15:51.368
Three Musketeers
than you're hoping for.

15:52.369 --> 15:55.439
You are underestimating him.

15:57.141 --> 15:58.275
Again.

16:02.312 --> 16:06.150
So whose idea was the reserve
comms with the bank account?

16:08.785 --> 16:09.786
His.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.456
It's clever.

16:13.623 --> 16:15.625
Is that the only way
you speak to each other?

16:16.626 --> 16:18.462
-No.
-How else?

16:20.330 --> 16:22.332
This isn't an interrogation.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.302
-Yes, it is.
-Okay.

16:25.335 --> 16:27.971
Maybe it is.
But not that way.

16:27.971 --> 16:30.174
You tell me
I only half know you.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.475
I'm trying.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.647
(clears throat)

16:40.650 --> 16:42.286
We speak on the phone.

16:42.319 --> 16:44.188
-Burner phones?
-Yes.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.656
-Where?
-Depends on the time of day,

16:46.690 --> 16:48.092
on my way to work.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.528
There's a garage on 10th and F.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.630
And at night,

16:53.663 --> 16:56.366
a playground in my neighborhood.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.835
-What about travel?
-What about it?

16:58.868 --> 17:01.805
When was the last time
you saw him?

17:01.838 --> 17:04.007
Fall, 2012.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.344
What about your
mother's funeral?

17:07.377 --> 17:09.045
I didn't go.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.050
We both felt
it was too dangerous.

17:15.185 --> 17:18.488
I wrote down what I felt
I needed to say

17:18.522 --> 17:21.458
and I asked him to put it
in the casket with her.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.694
So, all that time...

17:25.862 --> 17:27.897
...all you've been to him

17:27.964 --> 17:29.733
are sounds on the phone.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.301
A voice without a body.

17:34.638 --> 17:37.207
-Don't do that.
-Do what?

17:37.241 --> 17:39.309
Diminish it.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.546
He's made sacrifices for me.

17:43.547 --> 17:45.582
I've made sacrifices for them.

17:45.649 --> 17:48.885
That's what it took
to protect each other.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.088
Doesn't make him
any less of a father.

17:55.259 --> 17:57.026
What's left

17:57.060 --> 17:59.729
when all there is
is sacrifice?

18:02.899 --> 18:03.900
Clarity.

18:06.102 --> 18:09.739
Because I know there is nothing
he wouldn't give up for me.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.742
Or me for him.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.415
That's what love is.

18:35.465 --> 18:37.534
*

18:49.479 --> 18:51.548
(speaking indistinctly)

19:04.328 --> 19:06.996
Tell me again how you know
a person like this.

19:08.465 --> 19:10.834
He's gonna remember you, right?

19:12.636 --> 19:13.837
Oh, yeah.

19:25.148 --> 19:27.150
*

19:49.773 --> 19:51.541
What is that for?

20:00.617 --> 20:03.387
Down the corridor
there is a door I've left open.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.054
It leads to a passage

20:05.121 --> 20:07.557
that will take you
clear of the village.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.893
I assume you can
find your way from there.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.397
She sent you.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.300
To release me.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.469
Then why are my hands
still bound?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.873
You are the one they talk about.

20:23.907 --> 20:26.376
I've heard the stories.

20:27.644 --> 20:29.746
You are Hamzad's monster.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.818
They say he trusts you
like no other.

20:35.719 --> 20:37.921
Clearly, his wife does too.

20:38.922 --> 20:41.558
She's kept this from him,
I assume.

20:43.893 --> 20:46.062
He doesn't know
you're here, does he?

20:48.898 --> 20:51.568
What a contortion
she's put you in.

20:53.269 --> 20:57.240
Maybe even you aren't yet
certain what the knife is for.

21:02.946 --> 21:05.014
*

21:33.610 --> 21:34.711
Get out.

21:43.286 --> 21:45.288
(indistinct conversations
in Dari)

21:58.635 --> 22:00.804
*

22:16.686 --> 22:18.922
The Russian is gone.

22:20.256 --> 22:21.691
He escaped during the night.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.661
Somehow freed himself
from his bindings.

22:31.334 --> 22:34.170
Last night I had a dream
I have had many times before,

22:34.170 --> 22:35.772
since I was a boy.

22:36.706 --> 22:37.841
I'm alone.

22:39.042 --> 22:41.010
And I sense a presence
behind me.

22:42.446 --> 22:46.115
I can feel its breath, but I am
too afraid to turn to look.

22:48.217 --> 22:50.554
It whispers in a language
I feel I once knew

22:50.620 --> 22:53.857
but no longer understand.

22:58.027 --> 22:59.829
And though the words
have no meaning,

22:59.863 --> 23:02.198
I am consumed by terror.

23:05.034 --> 23:06.369
Because I know...

23:07.871 --> 23:11.374
...it is saying things
I am afraid to say about myself.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.880
And I know that they are true.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.657
And I awoke in a cold sweat,
as I always do.

23:30.093 --> 23:33.396
And I turned to my wife,
as I always have.

23:37.901 --> 23:39.669
And she was not there.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.776
My wife sometimes
wanders at night.

23:47.777 --> 23:49.412
She always has.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.616
Why? I don't know why.

23:56.285 --> 23:58.421
There are puzzles within her
that when solved,

23:58.454 --> 24:00.790
only ever lead to new puzzles.

24:03.292 --> 24:05.762
I love her despite it.

24:05.762 --> 24:08.765
Sometimes I believe
I may love her because of it.

24:10.266 --> 24:11.868
But this...

24:13.269 --> 24:14.938
This is something different.

24:17.607 --> 24:20.043
She would never do this.

24:21.978 --> 24:24.280
She would know
what this would mean.

24:34.991 --> 24:37.060
(indistinct conversations)

24:47.303 --> 24:48.772
Do you know which one he is?

24:48.805 --> 24:50.106
Yeah.

24:50.139 --> 24:51.941
'Cause there's a lot
of old white guys here

24:51.975 --> 24:53.643
that kind of look the same.

24:53.677 --> 24:54.811
Uh-huh.

24:58.982 --> 25:01.350
Second table from the stairs.

25:04.187 --> 25:06.923
Excuse me, do you have a pen?

25:09.826 --> 25:10.994
Thank you.

25:12.996 --> 25:14.664
Stay here.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.134
If anything gets weird,

25:18.167 --> 25:20.469
I'm coming to get you

25:20.503 --> 25:23.306
and we're going right back
where we came from.

25:23.339 --> 25:25.141
Define weird, please.

25:25.174 --> 25:26.342
You'll know.

25:27.844 --> 25:30.046
Right here.
Don't move.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.681
Clear?

25:52.135 --> 25:54.203
*

26:15.258 --> 26:17.326
*

26:36.279 --> 26:38.347
(man speaking French on P.A.)

26:52.929 --> 26:54.931
Hang on,
I've got to grab something.

27:01.104 --> 27:02.438
What's up?

27:02.438 --> 27:06.275
By the exit.
Tan jacket.

27:06.275 --> 27:10.113
-Yeah.
-I'm pretty sure he's DGST.

27:10.113 --> 27:11.614
Yeah.

27:12.615 --> 27:14.583
Actually, I think
I introduced you to him

27:14.617 --> 27:16.285
at some function or another.

27:16.285 --> 27:18.788
Abdellatif somebody.

27:19.789 --> 27:20.957
Rahmani.

27:23.793 --> 27:25.394
I called him.

27:29.132 --> 27:31.600
While you were in the head,
on the train.

27:31.634 --> 27:33.469
What for?

27:35.338 --> 27:38.074
There are two people
in my secure text contacts.

27:39.308 --> 27:40.977
My dad.

27:41.010 --> 27:43.079
And your grandson.

27:44.247 --> 27:46.482
Henry texts me before he goes
to sleep at night sometimes.

27:46.515 --> 27:47.817
Did you know that?

27:49.485 --> 27:50.653
No, I didn't.

27:52.021 --> 27:53.489
You should keep an eye on that.

27:55.024 --> 27:57.026
Especially when he gets
a little older.

28:02.932 --> 28:05.301
The other night he told me
that Cheryl took him upstairs

28:05.334 --> 28:07.336
when an old man came to visit.

28:08.504 --> 28:11.640
Came in a big black car
with a driver.

28:11.674 --> 28:13.977
He said it scared him.

28:14.010 --> 28:16.379
I have no idea who
it might have been

28:16.445 --> 28:18.314
but my guess is that if somebody

28:18.347 --> 28:21.184
from the seventh floor came to
visit that you would've told me.

28:22.786 --> 28:25.021
Unless...

28:25.021 --> 28:27.190
whatever he had to say
scared you too.

28:27.223 --> 28:30.226
And so you called
Abdellatif Rahmani

28:30.293 --> 28:32.661
to help get me on a plane
and send me home.

28:32.695 --> 28:33.997
-Yes.
-You shouldn't have done that.

28:34.030 --> 28:35.832
What did the seventh floor say
that scared you?

28:35.865 --> 28:37.733
It wasn't anyone
from the Bureau.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.535
-Who was it?
-It was Morgan Bote.

28:39.535 --> 28:42.238
He offered to get me
off the hook for all of this

28:42.305 --> 28:44.707
if I put you
on the hook in my place.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.910
To leave you here, behind,

28:46.976 --> 28:49.045
to disappear into the wild,

28:49.078 --> 28:51.547
and he would see my name
cleared at home.

28:53.316 --> 28:54.717
And what did you say?

28:54.717 --> 28:57.486
I told him to get the hell
out of my house.

29:02.725 --> 29:04.560
What are you to me?

29:05.895 --> 29:07.730
You're a complication
in my life that I didn't want.

29:07.763 --> 29:11.567
You're a wooden toy
asking to be made real.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.502
I can't help you there.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.440
You're a felon.
You're a traitor.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.742
You're a threat to my family,

29:19.775 --> 29:23.079
my career, my legacy, my life.

29:24.848 --> 29:27.450
But when I was offered
a magic wand

29:27.516 --> 29:30.786
to just make all this
go away, to make you...

29:30.854 --> 29:33.022
go away...

29:34.690 --> 29:38.294
God help me, I-I couldn't
stomach the thought of it.

29:44.467 --> 29:45.969
You should take it.

29:46.035 --> 29:47.403
What?

29:47.436 --> 29:49.272
You should take him up
on his offer.

29:49.305 --> 29:51.107
I'll take the hit.

29:52.475 --> 29:53.609
No, we're not gonna do that.

29:53.642 --> 29:54.777
I'll take it.

29:54.810 --> 29:57.446
You and I could go
round and round,

29:57.480 --> 30:00.316
but there are other people
involved in this.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.752
People who didn't ask to be.

30:03.786 --> 30:06.322
And those people
go to the front of the line.

30:07.490 --> 30:09.625
That's what my fathers
taught me.

30:14.497 --> 30:16.565
I'm going to fix this for them.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.303
And you're gonna do your part
by letting me do it.

30:20.336 --> 30:21.604
It won't work.

30:21.637 --> 30:23.772
In that part of the world,
with his resources,

30:23.806 --> 30:26.809
Faraz Hamzad is a ghost.

30:26.809 --> 30:29.445
He cannot be approached.
He cannot be touched.

30:29.478 --> 30:31.847
He cannot be killed,
no matter what your dad says.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.990
Okay, I'm underestimating him.

30:40.990 --> 30:42.325
Again.

30:48.664 --> 30:51.167
I think we both know
that this has to happen.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.837
Your story gets a happy ending.

30:59.175 --> 31:02.178
I'm still not even sure
what mine is really about.

31:03.879 --> 31:05.614
I have to go figure that out.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.617
No matter where it takes me.

31:34.978 --> 31:37.046
*

32:05.341 --> 32:08.111
-(boy calling out in Arabic)
-(bell tinkling)

32:27.263 --> 32:29.265
*

32:46.315 --> 32:48.084
Assistant Director.

32:48.117 --> 32:49.885
-Yeah.
-This way.

33:09.472 --> 33:11.474
*

33:39.368 --> 33:41.437
(indistinct conversations)

33:48.844 --> 33:50.613
May I offer you
something to drink, ma'am?

33:51.947 --> 33:53.116
Please.

34:02.858 --> 34:05.394
-How much do I owe you?
-No, no, ma'am.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.131
Got it.

34:15.638 --> 34:18.574
KRUGER:
It is going to be
so very tempting

34:18.641 --> 34:20.176
to blame yourself for that.

34:20.209 --> 34:21.510
(both laughing)

34:21.544 --> 34:24.247
I'd suggest you resist the urge.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.748
-You saw that, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

34:25.814 --> 34:28.717
Not to worry, your secret
is safe with me, Zoe.

34:40.263 --> 34:41.597
Who are you?

34:46.269 --> 34:48.904
Let's go someplace
we can speak privately.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.585
-Take a seat.
-(door closes)

35:02.618 --> 35:04.253
(grunts softly)

35:05.521 --> 35:08.624
Sergei, you are too young
to know this name.

35:08.691 --> 35:11.059
But if you served
in the Afghan War,

35:11.093 --> 35:13.929
it was a name
that made for nightmares.

35:13.929 --> 35:16.299
Baba Ghor Ghori.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.103
The monster from
children's make-believe...

35:22.771 --> 35:25.941
...who once saved my life.

35:25.941 --> 35:28.411
I wasn't sure you'd remember.

35:28.444 --> 35:31.614
Of all the debts
I've owed in my life,

35:31.647 --> 35:33.482
I never doubted that, uh,

35:33.549 --> 35:36.919
someday this one
would be called.

35:36.952 --> 35:39.988
Considering what it cost us
to help you escape,

35:40.055 --> 35:42.458
I think, well,
what I'm here to ask you for

35:42.458 --> 35:44.126
is pretty reasonable.

35:44.126 --> 35:47.663
What happened
in the aftermath of it all?

35:47.730 --> 35:49.465
I made inquiries,

35:49.498 --> 35:54.470
but I was never able to find out
what came of Belour.

35:54.470 --> 35:56.972
Oh, Belour, no.
You wouldn't have found her.

35:57.005 --> 35:58.674
No, once she left Afghanistan,

35:58.741 --> 36:01.777
that person ceased to exist.

36:01.810 --> 36:03.779
And you knew the person
she became.

36:03.812 --> 36:05.448
Mm.

36:05.481 --> 36:08.116
By another name, yes.

36:08.150 --> 36:09.852
What name is that?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.654
The wife.

36:11.687 --> 36:13.322
Wife?

36:14.590 --> 36:16.625
(chuckling)

36:16.659 --> 36:19.795
I don't imagine her husband
was very happy about that.

36:19.828 --> 36:21.697
No, he was not. No.

36:21.764 --> 36:24.032
He held a grudge for 30 years.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.669
And he's finally gained
leverage to act on it.

36:26.669 --> 36:28.504
Now he wants me dead.

36:29.672 --> 36:31.707
So I got to get to him first.

36:34.176 --> 36:36.144
What does this have
to do with me?

36:36.178 --> 36:39.715
You recruited his wife
as a Soviet asset,

36:39.782 --> 36:43.018
you started his
whole world unraveling.

36:43.018 --> 36:46.355
He's already tried to settle
his grudge he's got with me,

36:46.355 --> 36:48.391
what's to say

36:48.457 --> 36:51.627
that he won't address
the one he's got with you next?

36:59.468 --> 37:01.704
Is that what he thought?

37:01.704 --> 37:03.572
That I recruited her?

37:04.573 --> 37:06.575
Is that what you think?

37:11.046 --> 37:12.080
(clicks tongue)

37:13.215 --> 37:15.418
I was student in Moscow
when I met her.

37:17.553 --> 37:20.055
I thought I was pursuing her,

37:20.088 --> 37:22.391
but even at the time,

37:22.425 --> 37:25.894
I think I knew
it wasn't so simple.

37:27.229 --> 37:29.598
That she was, um...

37:29.665 --> 37:31.567
expert in triggering, uh,

37:31.567 --> 37:34.069
the instinct to pursue.

37:36.071 --> 37:37.740
The closer we got...

37:39.241 --> 37:41.243
...I more felt split in two.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.180
Half of me
falling in love with her.

37:46.248 --> 37:48.917
But, uh, the other half...

37:50.118 --> 37:51.454
...questioning.

37:53.456 --> 37:55.458
Does she feel the same way?

37:56.592 --> 37:59.261
Or is this all
because she knows...

38:01.464 --> 38:04.099
...my father is GRU?

38:06.101 --> 38:08.103
Maybe both were true.

38:09.438 --> 38:11.940
Maybe only the latter.
Who knows.

38:14.777 --> 38:16.278
But years later...

38:17.480 --> 38:20.616
...when I received
her first overture,

38:20.649 --> 38:22.918
offering me informations

38:22.951 --> 38:24.319
in exchange for

38:24.387 --> 38:27.956
undermining
her husband's rivals...

38:29.291 --> 38:31.794
...I think I knew

38:31.794 --> 38:35.631
whatever fantasies
lingered about her

38:35.631 --> 38:37.332
were just that.

38:39.134 --> 38:40.636
Fantasies.

38:43.472 --> 38:45.574
You both called her "wife."

38:46.842 --> 38:49.344
And you never knew any of that.

38:53.148 --> 38:56.151
Hard to fathom.
(chuckles)

38:58.654 --> 39:01.790
Though it does make, uh,

39:01.824 --> 39:05.193
today's events
a little easier to understand.

39:06.161 --> 39:07.996
Today's events?

39:08.030 --> 39:11.800
Faraz Hamzad's lawyer
is guest of mine today.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.836
She came to say that, uh,

39:13.836 --> 39:15.838
if I were to come across

39:15.838 --> 39:17.473
any information

39:17.506 --> 39:20.643
concerning your whereabouts, uh,

39:20.676 --> 39:23.679
that might win me
Hamzad's favor.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.715
Up until that moment,

39:26.782 --> 39:30.519
I wasn't aware
that was something I had

39:30.519 --> 39:32.621
any need for.

39:33.689 --> 39:35.057
When you see him,

39:35.123 --> 39:37.726
tell him I said hello.

39:37.793 --> 39:38.794
Sergei.

39:44.967 --> 39:47.135
(grunting)

39:56.144 --> 39:57.646
That's twice.

40:00.048 --> 40:03.085
-(door opens)
-KRUGER: This is all
going to be over shortly.

40:03.151 --> 40:06.021
Prompt answers are
of benefit to everyone.

40:06.054 --> 40:08.056
As far as I can tell,

40:08.090 --> 40:10.559
there are two scenarios
and only two.

40:10.593 --> 40:13.762
You're here voluntarily
or you're here involuntarily.

40:13.829 --> 40:16.899
Can you tell me
with which I'm dealing?

40:19.735 --> 40:21.269
How did you recognize me?

40:22.605 --> 40:24.573
Your photo was
in the police report.

40:24.607 --> 40:26.241
From the event at your house.

40:35.117 --> 40:38.754
My relationship with my client
forces me, from time to time,

40:38.787 --> 40:42.257
into the most
unpleasant positions.

40:42.290 --> 40:46.094
I represent him,
even in those moments,

40:46.128 --> 40:48.864
because I'm good at it,
because it's lucrative...

40:49.865 --> 40:51.266
...and because
the moment I stop,

40:51.266 --> 40:53.536
he will find somebody else
to continue.

40:55.270 --> 40:56.605
In this moment...

40:57.606 --> 41:00.108
...I am trying to seize
an opportunity

41:00.108 --> 41:03.779
to maybe do something decent
in the midst of it all.

41:07.883 --> 41:10.553
Maybe you should
consider letting me.

41:15.123 --> 41:17.760
And your client--

41:17.793 --> 41:21.129
you could guarantee
he'd go along with that?

41:26.134 --> 41:28.136
You're not his priority.

41:29.304 --> 41:31.406
I can guarantee you that.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.010
(man shouting in French)

41:36.344 --> 41:39.247
(gunshots)

41:50.158 --> 41:52.194
*

41:55.163 --> 41:56.999
Excusez, Mrs. Dixon.

41:56.999 --> 41:58.967
-Come with me, please.
-(gun cocks)

41:59.001 --> 42:01.536
-(gunshots)
-(woman screaming)

42:01.604 --> 42:03.672
(clamoring)

42:17.452 --> 42:19.521
Stay right here.

42:20.623 --> 42:21.957
At the bar.

42:23.892 --> 42:25.227
Is that not what I said?

42:25.293 --> 42:28.396
I did stay by the bar
until Faraz Hamzad's lawyer

42:28.463 --> 42:30.065
told me she knew
who I really was

42:30.132 --> 42:31.734
and told me to follow her.

42:33.636 --> 42:35.871
-She knew your name?
-Yes.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.408
All right, you probably
had to follow her.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.044
That's what I thought.

42:43.912 --> 42:45.981
What did she say?

42:47.650 --> 42:51.153
She said she could get me
out of all this safely.

42:53.488 --> 42:54.556
Yeah, and?

42:55.423 --> 42:56.992
What did you say?

42:59.261 --> 43:00.763
I'm here, aren't I?

43:30.125 --> 43:32.194
(engine stops)

43:39.534 --> 43:41.136
(siren wails)

43:41.203 --> 43:43.138
MAN (on bullhorn):
We have you surrounded!

43:43.205 --> 43:45.774
Do not attempt to flee!

44:09.464 --> 44:11.466
*

44:38.326 --> 44:40.328
So, how do you want to do this?

44:41.329 --> 44:42.664
Where's my daughter?

44:44.833 --> 44:47.135
I know she was with you,
where is she now?

44:47.169 --> 44:48.837
She's been taken.

44:50.605 --> 44:51.840
Taken?

44:53.675 --> 44:55.210
Taken by who?

44:55.277 --> 44:56.879
The old man.

45:03.351 --> 45:05.020
We're gonna go get her back.

47:20.822 --> 47:22.490
(rooster calls)
