00:00.624 --> 00:05.253
You're parsing the law, and
I'm talking about a spiritual code.

00:05.337 --> 00:07.881
Confidentiality is a covenant,

00:07.881 --> 00:10.091
not only between myself
and those I counsel,

00:10.175 --> 00:12.343
but also between myself
and the Lord.

00:12.343 --> 00:15.555
Dr. Larkin, my chief focus here
is the money laundering.

00:15.555 --> 00:20.309
If the President brought up Xander Feng,
Raymond Tusk, the Adohi casino...

00:20.309 --> 00:24.146
Doesn't matter what the focus is. I can't
share anything we discuss privately.

00:24.146 --> 00:26.273
Religious guidance is protected.

00:26.273 --> 00:28.566
But you were also conducting
professional therapy.

00:28.566 --> 00:31.402
- I never claimed that.
- Mr. and Mrs. Keith confirmed as much.

00:31.402 --> 00:34.280
We were at their house.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.242
But they didn't participate in our
conversations, so how would they know?

00:38.242 --> 00:41.870
So you're saying that you
only gave religious counsel.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.956
That's how I choose
to interpret it.

00:46.666 --> 00:50.503
The President and his wife have
never once attended your church.

00:50.503 --> 00:53.589
- They're not even the same denomination.
- Irrelevant.

00:53.589 --> 00:55.591
Not legally speaking.

00:55.591 --> 00:58.886
I'm certain I can convince a judge to
issue a subpoena on the grounds

00:58.886 --> 01:01.638
that you weren't their
legitimate spiritual advisor.

01:01.638 --> 01:05.016
Which is your prerogative,
but I can appeal.

01:05.016 --> 01:07.602
- And I would.
- You'd lose.

01:10.146 --> 01:12.982
The only circumstance
by which I would talk

01:12.982 --> 01:15.651
is if someone personally
waived their privilege.

01:15.651 --> 01:18.946
Otherwise, I'd rather face
contempt of court.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.322
It's a matter of ethics.

01:29.247 --> 01:31.291
Mr. President.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.252
Aww... You brought it back in.

01:34.252 --> 01:36.253
Floyd Mayweather visited
the White House this morning.

01:36.253 --> 01:39.006
- I thought he'd get a kick out of it.
- Did he have a go at it?

01:39.006 --> 01:41.925
He threw a combination I thought
would bust the stitching loose.

01:41.925 --> 01:43.885
That must have been
a treat to watch.

01:43.885 --> 01:46.388
He was telling me,
it's not just about the power.

01:46.388 --> 01:48.640
There are plenty of boxers
more powerful than he is.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.809
No, it's his tactics,
his precision, his speed,

01:51.809 --> 01:54.479
most important,
his counterpunch.

01:54.479 --> 02:00.526
He dances and dodges, then picks
the perfect moment to strike.

02:00.526 --> 02:03.403
Does that sound familiar?

02:03.403 --> 02:05.238
How do you mean, sir?

02:05.238 --> 02:08.949
You gave this to me
as a gesture of friendship.

02:08.949 --> 02:13.079
When I look at this now,
I don't see friendship,

02:13.079 --> 02:15.998
I see calculation.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.462
You set me up, Frank.

02:21.462 --> 02:24.256
- What?
- Your back-channeling,

02:24.256 --> 02:26.299
the special prosecutor...

02:26.299 --> 02:31.387
When I think about Raymond,
about Linda, about Jim Matthews...

02:32.889 --> 02:35.766
You are wrong, sir.

02:35.766 --> 02:39.853
Questions from Dunbar,
about the marriage counseling.

02:39.853 --> 02:42.189
"It's a needle in the haystack,
she's not trying to find."

02:42.189 --> 02:46.526
That's what you said.
Well, she found the needle.

02:46.526 --> 02:48.945
- I am shocked, sir, I never...
- Like hell you are.

02:48.945 --> 02:52.615
- You want to diminish me.
- Diminish you?

02:52.615 --> 02:56.702
Laying the groundwork
for a challenge in 2016.

02:56.702 --> 02:59.872
I am sorry to have to say this, sir,
but you are being ludicrous.

02:59.872 --> 03:02.958
Do you really think
I'm so blind?

03:02.958 --> 03:06.586
A vice president has never
challenged a sitting president!

03:06.586 --> 03:09.422
You've climbed the ladder doing
things other men would never do.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.425
Always in service
to you and the party.

03:12.425 --> 03:14.343
It was your idea
to hand over those logs.

03:14.343 --> 03:17.013
You connected the White House
to China, the casino.

03:17.013 --> 03:19.932
Raymond Tusk entangled us
with China and the casino.

03:19.932 --> 03:23.352
- And if I hadn't intervened...
- You can't dodge and duck like Floyd.

03:23.352 --> 03:25.020
I've learned your moves now.

03:27.022 --> 03:31.150
This office breeds paranoia.
Don't give into it, sir.

03:31.150 --> 03:34.654
I'd ask for your resignation if
it wouldn't make things worse.

03:34.654 --> 03:38.574
But from this moment forward,
I don't want to hear your voice.

03:38.574 --> 03:40.367
I don't want to see your face.

03:40.367 --> 03:45.205
And if I do, I will put you
on your goddamn back.

03:51.586 --> 03:53.379
Exile.

03:53.379 --> 03:57.633
I've managed to isolate
the president from everyone...

03:57.633 --> 04:00.386
...including myself.

04:06.099 --> 05:36.807

05:39.852 --> 05:44.606
"Congresswoman Sharp is a perfect example
of how the military brainwashes us

05:44.606 --> 05:46.858
into never questioning
the party line.

05:46.858 --> 05:49.652
Her opposition to the bill
is disgraceful.

05:49.652 --> 05:53.281
It will cost thousands of men and women
the justice they deserve,

05:53.281 --> 05:56.575
- and some of them their lives."
- Those are Megan Hennessey's words.

05:56.575 --> 05:58.869
- They're biased...
- They're Claire's words.

05:58.869 --> 06:02.331
Hennessey's just the mouthpiece.
Why does it say I declined to comment?

06:02.331 --> 06:04.333
You said you didn't want to kick
up dust if we could avoid it.

06:04.333 --> 06:07.711
It's <i> The New York</i> fucking <i> Times.</i>
You should've let me know.

06:07.711 --> 06:11.506
That was my call.
I'll take the blame.

06:11.506 --> 06:14.217
Find out when Hennessey's
next appearance is.

06:14.217 --> 06:17.094
- I want to beat this bitch down.
- I know she went after you.

06:17.094 --> 06:20.431
- but going after her...
- Not her, Claire Underwood.

06:20.431 --> 06:24.476
I understand how Garrett might misconstrue
things, given the pressure he's under,

06:24.476 --> 06:27.187
but you can't honestly
believe it yourself.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.481
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to believe anymore.</i>

06:29.481 --> 06:31.482
Francis is devastated.

06:31.482 --> 06:34.944
All he wants to do is help, but he
feels like he's being unfairly accused.

06:34.944 --> 06:38.864
<i>I don't want to believe it, Claire,</i>
<i>but Garrett is convinced.</i>

06:38.864 --> 06:40.532
Will you talk to him?

06:40.532 --> 06:43.827
I have to concentrate on keeping
my family together right now,

06:43.827 --> 06:45.495
not getting
into arguments over...

06:45.495 --> 06:47.455
<i>If Francis were</i>
<i>really up to something,</i>

06:47.455 --> 06:50.166
don't you think he would've
told Dunbar about the therapy?

06:50.166 --> 06:52.919
He basically did, by forcing us
to hand over the logs.

06:52.919 --> 06:55.421
Your husband chose
to hand them over.

06:55.421 --> 06:58.883
If he had said no, Francis
wouldn't have pressed the issue.

06:58.883 --> 07:00.801
I don't want to debate this
with you, Claire.

07:00.801 --> 07:05.222
<i>All I'm asking is that you</i>
<i>really think this through, Tricia.</i>

07:05.222 --> 07:07.974
- Is he with you right now?
- Who?

07:07.974 --> 07:12.186
<i>- Frank.</i>
- No, it's just you and me.

07:13.396 --> 07:15.106
I want to get off the phone.

07:15.106 --> 07:18.817
<i>- Will you please talk to Garrett?</i>
- Goodbye, Claire.

07:23.572 --> 07:25.407
What do you think?

07:25.407 --> 07:28.076
I don't think she's going to side
with me instead of her husband.

07:29.035 --> 07:32.330
Did Tricia tell anyone else
about the Xanax, besides you?

07:32.330 --> 07:35.583
I doubt she would.
She's very sensitive about it.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.043
If she'd only told someone else,
then we could just leak it.

07:38.043 --> 07:40.337
- But it'll too obvious.
- The doctor.

07:40.337 --> 07:43.966
He's protecting them.
He won't say anything.

07:43.966 --> 07:46.009
Unless they waive the privilege.

07:46.009 --> 07:49.179
They have absolutely
nothing to gain by that.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.560
But we do.

07:57.103 --> 07:59.438
- You have to meet with Tusk.
- Why would he talk to me

07:59.438 --> 08:01.940
- after I backstabbed him?
- That's precisely why he'll talk to you.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.984
- I can't go to St. Louis.
- Tusk will come east.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.694
Your job is to get
in the same room with him.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.446
- What's the play?
- Remy Danton, go.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.990
- Get me Durant, in person.
- I'll set it up.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.785
And Doug, let's make sure we're
airtight on everything else.

08:14.785 --> 08:18.914
- No Achilles' heel.
- Yes, sir.

08:18.914 --> 08:22.334
"Cry 'Havoc,'" said he who
fought chaos with chaos,

08:22.334 --> 08:25.045
"and let slip the dogs of war."

08:34.261 --> 08:38.015
Missed appointments,
no contact in weeks...

08:38.015 --> 08:40.808
- You know the rules.
- I'd like to speak to Agent Green, please.

08:40.808 --> 08:43.812
- What are you up to?
- Put Green on the fucking line, please.

08:43.812 --> 08:46.022
Anything you have to say,
you can discuss it with me.

08:46.022 --> 08:48.400
What I have to say
is way above your pay grade.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.110
Where do I turn off this shit?

08:52.737 --> 08:55.656
Look at the other screen,
to the left.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.791
- What is this?
- That is the access grid

09:05.791 --> 09:08.501
to all eight
of AT&T's data centers.

09:08.501 --> 09:11.045
So, what do you say you uncuff
me and tell Agent Green

09:11.045 --> 09:13.381
I'll be waiting for his call.

09:16.008 --> 09:18.427
I'm trying to repair
relations with China.

09:18.427 --> 09:21.013
Giving Feng asylum
would be a slap in the face.

09:21.013 --> 09:24.433
Garrett's in trouble.
He needs to appear resolute.

09:24.433 --> 09:28.269
We're only as strong as the president
we serve. We have to rescue him.

09:28.269 --> 09:31.147
How can you be sure his testimony
won't implicate the White House?

09:31.147 --> 09:33.191
He knows where
his bread is buttered.

09:33.191 --> 09:36.027
This isn't about
you saving the president.

09:36.027 --> 09:38.946
- Of course it is.
- We've been down this road before, Frank.

09:38.946 --> 09:43.450
Michael Kern, Adam Galloway.
I wanted to become secretary of state

09:43.450 --> 09:48.538
in order to engage in productive diplomacy,
not full-time damage control.

09:48.538 --> 09:51.082
Which is why we have
to put Garrett back on his feet.

09:51.082 --> 09:54.377
You want him on his ass, Frank.

09:54.377 --> 09:57.171
Is this what
the president told you?

09:57.171 --> 10:01.884
He's paranoid, Cathy.
He's trying to turn people against me.

10:01.884 --> 10:07.430
You're turning them against
yourself. You're asking me
to undermine the president.

10:12.643 --> 10:14.562
All right.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.776
Let's say that what the
president has accused me of...

10:20.776 --> 10:23.904
...is true.

10:23.904 --> 10:29.743
Would that be so bad,
if taken to its conclusion?

10:29.743 --> 10:32.287
Wouldn't you stand to benefit?

10:32.287 --> 10:35.873
Wouldn't the country?

10:35.873 --> 10:41.378
- I don't want anything to do with this.
- Just one more time, Cathy.

10:41.378 --> 10:44.965
Let's unshackle ourselves.

10:44.965 --> 10:48.093
This is a one-time
offer, Mr. Feng.

10:48.093 --> 10:51.763
<i>I would need it in writing.
Open-ended, no restrictions.</i>

10:51.763 --> 10:54.056
<i>The same goes</i>
<i>for legal immunity.</i>

10:54.056 --> 10:57.435
First I need to know whether or not you
funneled money through Lanagin's casino.

10:57.435 --> 11:01.230
No. I will speak freely once I have
arrived safely in the United States.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.440
<i>Unless you provide</i>
<i>valuable evidence now,</i>

11:03.440 --> 11:07.277
the attorney general will not
grant immunity on any level.

11:07.277 --> 11:09.988
<i>I have denied</i>
<i>these allegations in China.</i>

11:09.988 --> 11:13.408
<i>My enemies want me dead. You're asking
me to give them confirmation.</i>

11:13.408 --> 11:15.910
And we're giving you
safe haven in return.

11:15.910 --> 11:18.078
<i>I already have</i>
<i>safe haven in Dubai.</i>

11:18.078 --> 11:23.041
Your asylum there is only temporary.
We're offering you permanent status.

11:23.041 --> 11:25.752
<i>I'm confident that they will</i>
<i>grant me permanent status.</i>

11:25.752 --> 11:29.089
Did you hear that directly from
the minister of foreign affairs?

11:29.089 --> 11:31.341
<i>Because I just spoke to him.</i>

11:31.341 --> 11:34.135
Right now you are a man
without a passport.

11:34.135 --> 11:36.887
Whatever assets
Beijing hasn't seized

11:36.887 --> 11:41.058
are frozen in every country with close ties
to the United States or China,

11:41.058 --> 11:44.311
which is just about every
country in the world.

11:44.311 --> 11:47.230
You want your freedom
and fortune.

11:47.230 --> 11:50.066
<i>We want information.</i>

11:51.776 --> 11:54.529
<i>Mr. Feng?</i>

11:54.529 --> 11:56.405
What do you need to know?

11:56.405 --> 12:00.576
<i>Confirm for me the existence</i>
<i>of a money laundering scheme.</i>

12:01.201 --> 12:02.703
Yes.

12:02.703 --> 12:06.998
<i>We used the casino</i>
<i>to mask foreign contributions.</i>

12:08.583 --> 12:11.377
All right.

12:11.377 --> 12:15.381
One of you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

12:15.381 --> 12:18.801
- You have to comply.
- You mean I have to show up.

12:18.801 --> 12:21.512
- Unless we appeal.
- We'd lose.

12:21.512 --> 12:24.973
She wouldn't have issued the subpoena
unless she had something substantial.

12:24.973 --> 12:28.226
I agree, which is why I think you
should go and plead the Fifth.

12:28.226 --> 12:31.271
- What do you think she has?
- I don't want to speculate.

12:31.271 --> 12:33.981
Goddamn it, I pay
the six of you more in one day

12:33.981 --> 12:35.983
than it costs to put
a kid through college.

12:35.983 --> 12:37.985
I pay you to know
more than I do.

12:37.985 --> 12:40.029
Her line of questioning
will tell us a lot.

12:40.029 --> 12:44.533
We could use that to prepare
a defense in case there's an indictment.

12:44.533 --> 12:48.662
- When do I have to go?
- Your interview is the day after next.

12:48.662 --> 12:50.914
Forty-eight hours?

13:26.863 --> 13:28.990
- Having trouble starting it?
- Yeah.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.783
I think the battery
might be dead.

13:30.783 --> 13:32.827
I have some cables
if you want to try and jump it.

13:33.870 --> 13:37.665
- You sure you don't mind?
- Not at all.

13:37.665 --> 13:39.667
All right.
That's really nice of you.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.251
Pop your hood.
I'll bring my car around.

13:41.251 --> 13:42.711
Sure.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.423
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Peter.

13:46.423 --> 13:49.426
- He's the guy who drove me back.
- Oh.

13:49.426 --> 13:53.096
- Where do you want these?
- I'll take them. Thanks.

13:54.430 --> 13:57.433
- Rachel, right?
- Yeah.

13:57.433 --> 13:59.852
- Lisa said you two are roommates.
- Can I get you something?

13:59.852 --> 14:02.813
- A glass of water?
- No, thanks. I should get going.

14:02.813 --> 14:04.439
All right.
I can't thank you enough.

14:04.439 --> 14:05.941
My pleasure.
Good luck with the car.

14:05.941 --> 14:08.818
- Thanks.
- I hope it's only a dead battery.

14:08.818 --> 14:10.195
Have a good night.

14:11.946 --> 14:13.531
We should give him some money.

14:13.531 --> 14:16.325
- What?
- Peter!

14:20.579 --> 14:21.997
She needs to be gone.

14:23.707 --> 14:26.459
- You told me she could stay.
- I changed my mind.

14:26.459 --> 14:28.461
But you said you didn't care
if she was here.

14:28.461 --> 14:32.173
I don't need to explain myself.

14:32.173 --> 14:36.344
You can't stand it, can you? The idea
that I might actually love somebody,

14:36.344 --> 14:38.804
that I might have somebody
in my life who isn't you.

14:38.804 --> 14:42.057
If you care about her,
make it happen, Rachel.

14:42.057 --> 14:45.185
- Hey. Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.103
You need to tell your friend
that I won't take any money.

14:47.103 --> 14:50.607
I was happy to do it. We all need
a good Samaritan every now and again.

14:55.778 --> 14:58.656
Did you feel justice was served
when General McGinnis

14:58.656 --> 14:59.782
got sentenced to 40 years?

14:59.782 --> 15:01.700
Yes, as far as his crimes go,

15:01.700 --> 15:03.910
but not for thousands
of servicemen...

15:03.910 --> 15:08.081
I'm sorry to interrupt, but my producer
is telling me that Jacqueline Sharp

15:08.081 --> 15:10.583
has called in,
the House majority whip.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.211
- Congresswoman, are you there?
- <i> Yes, I'm here, Chris.</i>

15:13.211 --> 15:16.172
<i>- Thank you for taking my call.</i>
<i>- </i> Thank you.

15:16.172 --> 15:19.049
<i>- Hello, Megan.</i>
<i>- Congresswoman.</i>

15:19.049 --> 15:20.926
First of all, as a veteran like
yourself,

15:20.926 --> 15:23.387
I want to thank you for your
service to our country.

15:23.387 --> 15:26.932
<i>- Duty doesn't require thanks.</i>
- I'm glad you brought up duty,

15:26.932 --> 15:30.268
because you recently
equated it with brainwashing.

15:30.268 --> 15:34.730
- That's not what I meant.
- <i> You said "toeing the party line."</i>

15:34.730 --> 15:37.483
What I meant was the culture
and the system is one...

15:37.483 --> 15:39.610
I didn't call to argue with you,
Megan. The opposite.

15:39.610 --> 15:43.447
We can't fix this problem until we find
some common ground, wouldn't you agree?

15:43.447 --> 15:45.574
There is no middle ground,
as far as I'm concerned.

15:45.574 --> 15:48.410
- The military needs to change...
- Can't we agree that you and I served

15:48.410 --> 15:52.997
so that we could protect open debate,
which is the very bedrock of democracy?

15:52.997 --> 15:55.291
Yes, in theory, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.710
<i>Not in theory, in reality.</i>

15:57.710 --> 16:00.379
Brave men and women
die fighting for that freedom.

16:00.379 --> 16:05.550
The meaning of bravery is fighting for the
freedom of those with whom you disagree.

16:05.550 --> 16:07.427
Sure, but let's get back
to the issue here.

16:07.427 --> 16:09.012
<i>What I don't think is brave</i>

16:09.012 --> 16:11.973
is Claire Underwood
dodging this debate

16:11.973 --> 16:14.183
and having you fight this battle
for her instead.

16:14.183 --> 16:15.977
<i>That's not true.</i>

16:15.977 --> 16:18.979
<i>Then why am I talking to you</i>
<i>instead of her? It's her bill.</i>

16:18.979 --> 16:20.898
<i>It's not just hers.</i>
<i>It's all of ours.</i>

16:20.898 --> 16:23.775
<i>Except one of you</i>
<i>is brave enough to say it,</i>

16:23.775 --> 16:25.986
<i>and the other is a coward.</i>

16:25.986 --> 16:29.823
<i>Mrs. Underwood was brave enough to go
on national television and admit that...</i>

16:29.823 --> 16:31.491
<i>And where has she been since?</i>

16:31.491 --> 16:34.118
<i>Deflecting scandal</i>
<i>and hiding from the press.</i>

16:34.118 --> 16:39.081
<i>You called me disgraceful in</i>
The New York Times,<i> Megan,</i>
<i>and you have every right.</i>

16:39.081 --> 16:43.085
But I also have the right to say
that Mrs. Underwood is disgraceful,

16:43.085 --> 16:47.297
because nothing is more
disgraceful than running from a battle.

16:50.425 --> 16:51.676
- Megan?
- That isn't...

16:51.676 --> 16:54.345
<i>We're not even...</i>

16:55.888 --> 16:57.765
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

17:00.100 --> 17:04.896
- Where are you going?
- To the Capitol.

17:04.896 --> 17:07.607
Did Feng mention either
me or the president?

17:07.607 --> 17:11.152
Dunbar wouldn't say, but the fact that
Feng confirmed the money laundering

17:11.152 --> 17:13.029
increases focus
on the White House.

17:13.029 --> 17:15.156
As long as we're innocent,
which we are...

17:15.156 --> 17:17.867
Raymond Tusk
has been subpoenaed.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.954
Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?
Just keeping us in the loop?

17:22.954 --> 17:26.374
Did you encourage Secretary
Durant to offer Feng asylum?

17:26.374 --> 17:28.877
Bill, for godsakes.

17:28.877 --> 17:31.296
The president could have
asked me that question himself.

17:31.296 --> 17:32.964
As White House counsel,
it is my responsibility...

17:32.964 --> 17:34.757
No, I did not.

17:34.757 --> 17:37.968
So you're saying Durant
acted of her own accord.

17:37.968 --> 17:40.137
I have no idea what her
motivations were.

17:40.137 --> 17:42.639
I'm just as shocked as the president
that she would have gone through with this

17:42.639 --> 17:44.933
without his direct approval.

17:44.933 --> 17:49.145
There's another matter
I'd like to discuss, privately if we could.

17:49.145 --> 17:51.397
Just give us a few moments.

17:59.947 --> 18:01.949
- The therapy.
- Yes.

18:01.949 --> 18:04.493
To be specific,
the confidentiality waiver.

18:04.493 --> 18:07.579
Feng's testimony puts us
in a very awkward position.

18:07.579 --> 18:09.747
We're under a great deal of
pressure to waive the privilege.

18:09.747 --> 18:13.960
If we don't, it implies that the president
may have confessed to things he didn't.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.337
Dunbar is just grasping,
don't give in.

18:16.337 --> 18:20.966
I don't want to, but Larkin's argument
for spiritual confidentiality

18:20.966 --> 18:22.968
is shaky at best.

18:22.968 --> 18:26.054
We want to control
how this thing plays out.

18:26.054 --> 18:27.764
How can I help?

18:27.764 --> 18:30.266
We need to know if anyone else
might pop out of the woodwork.

18:30.266 --> 18:32.685
Well, I haven't mentioned it to
anyone and neither has Claire.

18:32.685 --> 18:35.563
I would never betray
the president's trust like that.

18:37.481 --> 18:41.360
Thank you for your time.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.697
Tell the president it saddens me that we
now have to communicate through lawyers.

18:45.697 --> 18:49.159
I will make myself available if
he wants to discuss any of this in person.

18:49.159 --> 18:50.285
Yes, sir.

18:50.285 --> 18:52.036
What Megan said was offensive.

18:52.036 --> 18:53.955
She shouldn't have
questioned your character.

18:53.955 --> 18:58.000
Those were talking points,
carefully crafted and not by her.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.628
I'm not here to pick a fight,
Jackie. I'm here to end one.

19:01.628 --> 19:03.755
It'll end soon enough,
when the bill goes to the floor.

19:03.755 --> 19:05.590
It won't go to the floor.

19:05.590 --> 19:10.386
I've spoken to Elaine Brooks
and I'm withdrawing the bill.

19:10.386 --> 19:13.306
What you said had some truth.

19:13.306 --> 19:17.476
Early on, you offered to sit down
with me and find a middle ground.

19:17.476 --> 19:20.020
I decided to draw a line
in the sand.

19:20.020 --> 19:24.358
The braver thing would've been for me
to swallow my pride and sit down with you.

19:24.358 --> 19:28.570
If you're still open to that,
I'd love to start over.

19:28.570 --> 19:32.198
- Are you and Frank up to something?
- A passable bill.

19:32.198 --> 19:37.328
He had Nancy spy on me. He
brought my personal life into...

19:37.328 --> 19:39.580
Francis is used
to getting his way,

19:39.580 --> 19:42.249
and he'll do anything
to make sure he does,

19:42.249 --> 19:44.668
especially if it's something
important to me.

19:44.668 --> 19:49.047
I don't know, Claire.
I'm skeptical.

19:49.047 --> 19:51.257
We're deeply sorry
for the way we've treated you.

19:51.257 --> 19:55.261
And we want to rebuild
the trust we've lost.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.388
Do you think that's possible?

20:08.189 --> 20:10.733
I'm sorry to ambush you,
I tried calling.

20:10.733 --> 20:12.235
You can't do this to me, Claire.

20:12.235 --> 20:14.654
I was very clear that I have
to respect Garrett's...

20:14.654 --> 20:18.991
Not that, the sexual assault
bill, it's not going to a vote.

20:18.991 --> 20:21.243
Did the Speaker
remove it from the docket?

20:21.243 --> 20:23.537
No, I did.

20:23.537 --> 20:25.914
I just spoke to Jackie.

20:25.914 --> 20:27.832
This is because of what
she said about you?

20:27.832 --> 20:30.668
My main concern is that
she doesn't come after you next.

20:30.668 --> 20:34.046
Not while you and Garrett are
going through the investigation.

20:34.046 --> 20:38.342
I thought you should be aware, because
I know how much this bill meant to you.

20:38.342 --> 20:41.637
- All the work you've put in.
- That we've put in.

20:41.637 --> 20:45.849
But we'll pass Jackie's version,
take this baby step and build on it.

20:45.849 --> 20:50.603
I'm disappointed about the bill,
but I have to say, I'm relieved.

20:50.603 --> 20:52.522
How are you holding up?

20:52.522 --> 20:55.650
Did you hear what Catherine did,
giving Feng asylum?

20:55.650 --> 20:58.486
- Inexcusable.
- Garrett's beside himself.

20:58.486 --> 21:01.989
He feels cornered, like we have no choice
but to waive the privilege now.

21:01.989 --> 21:04.408
- But what about the medication?
- I know.

21:06.034 --> 21:08.286
I shouldn't be sharing this.

21:08.286 --> 21:10.079
We don't have to talk about it.
You should go.

21:10.079 --> 21:12.832
I know you have
a packed schedule.

21:16.210 --> 21:18.129
<i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

21:18.129 --> 21:20.422
<i>All I had to do was</i>
<i>get her alone in a hallway.</i>

21:20.422 --> 21:24.009
<i>- I meant with Jackie.</i>
- We have our priorities.

21:24.009 --> 21:27.304
I know it isn't easy to let go
of something like that.

21:27.304 --> 21:32.308
- Promise me something.
- Anything.

21:32.308 --> 21:36.854
- I can't live in this house alone.
- I'm not going anywhere.

21:36.854 --> 21:40.190
You say that,
but this could all backfire.

21:40.190 --> 21:41.900
Raymond will plead the Fifth.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.570
If he names me, it's an
admission of his own wrongdoing.

21:45.570 --> 21:49.532
I'm more worried about Garrett.
You've made a powerful enemy.

21:49.532 --> 21:54.412
- We're stronger than they are.
- And he's still the president.

21:54.412 --> 21:58.749
I promise you, of all the
sacrifices that you've had to make,

21:58.749 --> 22:02.252
divorcing a convict
will not be one of them.

22:02.252 --> 22:04.087
We can't waive
the privilege, Garrett.

22:04.087 --> 22:05.964
- We don't have a choice anymore.
- Feng confirmed the money.

22:05.964 --> 22:07.841
Over the phone,
not in a formal interview.

22:07.841 --> 22:09.551
Rescind the asylum,
send him back...

22:09.551 --> 22:11.928
- Obstruction of justice.
- Is that what Galich said?

22:11.928 --> 22:14.472
Definitely how it will be perceived.
And anything we do that looks

22:14.472 --> 22:17.058
like a failure to cooperate
amplifies that perception.

22:17.058 --> 22:19.727
I just don't want
our marriage put on display.

22:19.727 --> 22:22.604
Look, Dunbar will ask
if I brought up China. I didn't.

22:22.604 --> 22:25.232
So Larkin can only help
to exonerate me.

22:25.232 --> 22:27.567
And if the marriage counseling
ends up in her report, so be it.

22:27.567 --> 22:30.069
- We can survive that.
- But he prescribed us medication.

22:30.069 --> 22:32.905
- Technically, not us.
- You took mine, Garrett.

22:32.905 --> 22:35.324
Larkin wrote the prescription
to me knowing you would.

22:35.324 --> 22:39.161
Wait, have you mentioned it?
The medication?

22:41.121 --> 22:44.082
- Claire?
- I'm sorry, but she's the only person

22:44.082 --> 22:46.001
I can talk to who really
understands what it's like...

22:46.001 --> 22:47.961
All the more reason
we have to waive the privilege.

22:47.961 --> 22:50.547
If they leak this, we can't
control the information.

22:50.547 --> 22:53.508
- Claire wouldn't do that.
- Don't underestimate her.

22:53.508 --> 22:57.219
If they were going to, don't you think
they would have done it by now?

22:57.219 --> 23:00.222
She dropped the sexual assault
bill to reduce pressure on us.

23:00.222 --> 23:01.932
That may have been
what she told you.

23:01.932 --> 23:03.892
They're not going
to say anything.

23:05.560 --> 23:09.522
I'm begging you, Garrett,
don't waive the privilege.

23:11.774 --> 23:14.193
The things we talked about
were so intimate.

23:14.193 --> 23:17.196
- Imagine if the kids...
- I know, but Tricia...

23:17.196 --> 23:21.909
When we ran, I knew every aspect
of our lives would be under scrutiny,

23:21.909 --> 23:24.453
but I thought we could
protect at least this.

23:24.453 --> 23:27.414
What happens in here...

23:27.414 --> 23:29.791
I'll protect us.

23:29.791 --> 23:32.251
Whatever I have to do.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.255
You have to believe that.

24:02.863 --> 24:05.073
We checked the USB dongle.

24:05.073 --> 24:08.076
The code you're claiming
infected the data center isn't there.

24:08.076 --> 24:11.037
I programmed the code to
self-erase as soon as it hit the server.

24:11.037 --> 24:12.830
It was gone before
Lucas was in cuffs.

24:13.915 --> 24:15.625
You don't believe me?

24:15.625 --> 24:17.626
This is one of the most
sophisticated firewalls in the world.

24:17.626 --> 24:20.129
Even if your code did get you in there,
you couldn't break it down.

24:20.129 --> 24:22.673
Your wife uses AT&T.

24:22.673 --> 24:25.634
- So does her lover.
- What?

24:25.634 --> 24:27.469
She's over there right now.

24:27.469 --> 24:31.389
Jonathan Kemp.
It's her chiropractor, right?

24:33.391 --> 24:36.143
Want to see
their texts to each other?

24:37.436 --> 24:41.982
- No.
- Oh, I see, you already know.

24:41.982 --> 24:47.320
I don't blame you for not making a fuss,
with the kids still at home.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.614
But you walked my code
right through that door,

24:49.614 --> 24:52.116
into 32 million people's phones.

24:52.116 --> 24:54.702
And that's on you,

24:54.702 --> 24:56.829
and it's on the FBI,

24:56.829 --> 25:00.207
and it's a shit storm that will bring
the bureau right in front of Congress.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.919
So you tell me, how much is
making that disappear worth?

25:03.919 --> 25:08.048
You have a hundred years hanging over your
head, extorting the FBI won't help you.

25:08.048 --> 25:12.343
Did Douglas Stamper tell you
to set up Lucas Goodwin?

25:12.343 --> 25:16.514
Counterterrorism Director, that's
a big step up from White House Liaison.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.432
- I think you had a helping hand.
- Not true.

25:18.432 --> 25:20.976
Keep lying.
Meanwhile, here's what I want.

25:20.976 --> 25:25.021
One... I'm no longer your bitch.

25:25.021 --> 25:27.607
Two, all of my charges
are dropped.

25:27.607 --> 25:29.400
Three, all of Barrett Brown's
charges are dropped.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.487
- That's up to the US attorney.
- Figure it out.

25:35.448 --> 25:37.491
If I'm hearing you correctly,

25:37.491 --> 25:40.411
you'd like to keep Larkin's testimony
focused on the money laundering.

25:40.411 --> 25:42.871
Which I never brought up,
because I knew nothing about it.

25:42.871 --> 25:46.208
But your concern is other
matters, private matters.

25:46.208 --> 25:49.044
Which are irrelevant
to the investigation.

25:49.044 --> 25:52.463
I can't prevent Dunbar from
asking what she's going to ask.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.881
Of course not, Bill.

25:53.881 --> 25:56.842
The most I can do is ask
Dr. Larkin how he would

25:56.842 --> 25:59.219
respond to certain questions.

25:59.219 --> 26:02.681
But he's a smart man. He'll
understand what I'm getting at.

26:02.681 --> 26:06.601
And this approach keeps us within the law?
We're not tampering with testimony?

26:06.601 --> 26:08.520
It's a fine line,

26:08.520 --> 26:10.980
- but I'll stay on the right side of it.
- Thanks.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.566
He shut me out, Frank,
just like he did with you.

26:13.566 --> 26:16.861
My undersecretary has been
assigned full diplomatic authority.

26:16.861 --> 26:20.030
A temporary setback, Cathy.
Where I go, you go.

26:20.030 --> 26:23.575
At this very moment, the president
is in the Situation Room.

26:23.575 --> 26:27.078
China responded to Feng's asylum
exactly the way I predicted.

26:27.078 --> 26:30.123
They're doubling their naval
presence off the coast of Yonaguni.

26:30.123 --> 26:33.918
And you know who isn't in
the Situation Room? You and I, Frank.

26:36.253 --> 26:39.173
You're thinking about where we
are instead of where we're headed.

26:39.173 --> 26:45.387
Now, that isn't the Catherine Durant
I waltzed with at the Jefferson Ball.

26:46.805 --> 26:49.099
She understood potential.

26:49.099 --> 26:52.769
She had her eyes
toward the future.

26:52.769 --> 26:57.440
I told that Catherine Durant that
we needed her in the State Department.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.483
We still need her.

26:59.483 --> 27:03.654
I wish I knew where she was,
because she's not the Catherine Durant

27:03.654 --> 27:06.198
sitting in front
of me right now.

27:06.198 --> 27:09.325
But I'll tell you something.

27:09.325 --> 27:14.413
If she doesn't show up soon,
I'm just gonna have to keep waltzing alone

27:14.413 --> 27:20.461
because I'm done trying to
convince this woman in front of me...

27:20.461 --> 27:23.380
...to take my arm.

27:25.674 --> 27:28.218
Oh, don't let me keep you.

27:33.556 --> 27:37.101
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere, Frank.

27:37.101 --> 27:40.479
You still have access
to the presidential briefing?

27:40.479 --> 27:42.189
Yes, I have it right here.

27:42.189 --> 27:46.693
Walk me through everything
that's going on with China.

27:46.693 --> 27:50.155
Feng is in play now.
We might be able to use him.

27:50.155 --> 27:52.448
- How?
- I don't know yet.

27:52.448 --> 27:57.787
But he's clearly valuable to Beijing,
which makes him valuable to us.

27:57.787 --> 28:00.831
- Nothing about Xander Feng?
- Never.

28:00.831 --> 28:03.792
Daniel Lanagin? Raymond Tusk?

28:03.792 --> 28:05.544
We only discussed
their marriage,

28:05.544 --> 28:07.087
nothing about the business
of the White House.

28:07.087 --> 28:08.463
Any oblique reference

28:08.463 --> 28:10.340
to work-related pressures
he was feeling?

28:10.340 --> 28:13.509
He said he wasn't getting
as much sleep as he'd like.

28:13.509 --> 28:16.303
Did you ever prescribe
him any medication?

28:16.303 --> 28:20.015
As I've always stated,
I provided religious counsel.

28:20.015 --> 28:22.768
I understand,
but I'm asking about medication.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.895
How is this relevant?

28:24.895 --> 28:28.898
I'm trying to assess whether his
judgment may have been impaired.

28:28.898 --> 28:33.319
In my opinion, he and his wife
were dealing with standard marital issues.

28:33.319 --> 28:35.071
That's not what
I asked, Dr. Larkin.

28:35.071 --> 28:38.532
So I will ask for a third time,
and let me be more specific,

28:38.532 --> 28:42.536
was any medication prescribed or taken
as a result of your counseling session,

28:42.536 --> 28:45.372
by the president
of the United States?

28:47.540 --> 28:51.878
His faculties were operating at
100 percent, if that's what you're asking.

28:54.255 --> 28:57.883
Has anyone from the
Administration spoken to you?

28:57.883 --> 28:59.927
- How do you mean?
- About this deposition.

28:59.927 --> 29:04.473
Has anyone approached you,
coached you?

29:04.473 --> 29:08.143
If you tell me now, I will qualify that
as a timely declaration.

29:08.143 --> 29:11.271
- I'd like to leave.
- The president waived his privilege.

29:11.271 --> 29:15.024
- But I'm here voluntarily.
- Dr. Larkin, at first you wouldn't

29:15.024 --> 29:20.195
talk to me because it violated
your ethical code, I respect that,

29:20.195 --> 29:23.490
but let me ask you,
as a man of faith,

29:23.490 --> 29:26.785
is deliberately lying to me
an exception to that code?

29:26.785 --> 29:31.914
Because that is what you're doing
by refusing to share the truth.

29:31.914 --> 29:35.751
- I don't understand.
- It wasn't going to pass.

29:35.751 --> 29:37.628
But you said
we almost had the votes.

29:37.628 --> 29:40.964
We needed to be 100 percent
solid, and we weren't.

29:40.964 --> 29:43.425
If the bill failed,
that would set us back.

29:43.425 --> 29:47.554
We need to accept
incremental reform.

29:47.554 --> 29:50.265
You sound
just like Jackie Sharp.

29:50.265 --> 29:52.558
I'm actually
working with her now.

29:52.558 --> 29:57.021
- She's a powerful ally for us to have.
- After what she did to me?

29:57.021 --> 29:58.647
After what she said about you?

29:58.647 --> 30:01.817
If I let the things people say
about me get under my skin,

30:01.817 --> 30:04.194
I wouldn't be able
to leave my own home.

30:04.194 --> 30:06.154
You know how this will go.

30:06.154 --> 30:10.408
Everyone will say, great, we did
something, which is really nothing.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.910
They'll pat themselves
on the back and they'll forget about it.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.829
We helped put this on the radar.

30:14.829 --> 30:19.333
I thought we were doing
something real, changing people's lives.

30:19.333 --> 30:23.003
How naive, right? But at least
I didn't want to give up.

30:23.003 --> 30:26.339
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right,
you are a fucking coward.

30:26.339 --> 30:29.467
I'm the one that pulled
you out from under the covers.

30:29.467 --> 30:34.388
You were hiding, you and your pills.
You tell yourself whatever you need to.

30:38.225 --> 30:41.603
I'm sorry.

30:41.603 --> 30:44.606
There were political realities
we couldn't ignore.

30:46.733 --> 30:49.277
Do you ever wonder why
so many people hate Washington?

30:49.277 --> 30:52.905
It's because of people like you
using phrases like that.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.376
Raymond?

31:06.376 --> 31:10.004
I'd turn the lights on, but when you're
paying for the room with the best view,

31:10.004 --> 31:12.215
you might as well
make the most of it.

31:12.215 --> 31:16.344
I've never been in
the penthouse here, have you?

31:16.344 --> 31:19.221
What's going on?

31:19.221 --> 31:22.307
Do you know why I'm in DC?

31:22.307 --> 31:26.520
Oh, it's OK, Remy, there's nothing you
can say that I don't already know.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.188
Feng is on his way to testify.

31:28.188 --> 31:30.899
Whatever Seth has told you,
don't believe a word of it.

31:32.442 --> 31:35.945
What might he have told me
that I shouldn't believe?

31:35.945 --> 31:39.156
You met with
the vice president in a church,

31:39.156 --> 31:41.408
- don't pretend you didn't.
- Playing both sides?

31:41.408 --> 31:44.911
- Raymond, look.
- I want to hear you say it.

31:44.911 --> 31:46.580
That you met with Frank.

31:46.580 --> 31:48.957
I'll talk to you, Raymond,
but not with him here.

31:50.833 --> 31:52.835
Leave us.

31:54.837 --> 31:58.174
- Should I hold the elevator for you?
- Go fuck yourself.

31:58.174 --> 32:00.843
OK, you can take the stairs.

32:06.223 --> 32:10.810
- They're toying with you, Raymond.
- No doubt,

32:10.810 --> 32:12.979
but so are you, Remy.

32:12.979 --> 32:15.731
I wanted to lead Frank on, give
him a false sense of security.

32:15.731 --> 32:17.733
If you're going to lie,
lie better than that.

32:17.733 --> 32:20.569
They want to tear us apart.

32:20.569 --> 32:23.739
I don't blame you for wanting
to keep your options open,

32:23.739 --> 32:27.367
but clearly you have bought
the wrong insurance policy.

32:27.367 --> 32:29.577
Don't shoot yourself
in the foot like this.

32:29.577 --> 32:32.830
Your foot,
and you're holding the gun.

32:32.830 --> 32:36.792
- Now go some place else to bleed.
- You want to talk about blood?

32:36.792 --> 32:38.544
How much have you spilled
in this war with Frank?

32:38.544 --> 32:40.379
All I've tried to do
is keep the peace.

32:40.379 --> 32:42.089
You could've let him
have the upper hand.

32:42.089 --> 32:44.966
What would that have really
cost you, other than your pride?

32:51.514 --> 32:55.142
Such a shame.

32:55.142 --> 33:00.397
You have just made 42 billion
enemies, Remy, and some change.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.941
Thirty-nine billion, Raymond.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.527
Your market cap is shrinking.

33:09.989 --> 33:13.242
<i>White House counsel Bill Galich</i>
<i>was called into questioning this morning</i>

33:13.242 --> 33:15.828
<i>by Special Prosecutor</i>
<i>Heather Dunbar.</i>

33:15.828 --> 33:19.540
<i>According to Dunbar's office,</i>
<i>there are suspicions that Galich</i>

33:19.540 --> 33:22.000
<i>may have tampered</i>
<i>with witness testimony.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:24.378
<i>The witness in question</i>
<i>is Dr. Thomas Larkin,</i>

33:24.378 --> 33:28.590
<i>a reverend and therapist who allegedly
conducted secret marriage counseling</i>

33:28.590 --> 33:31.634
<i>sessions for the president</i>
<i>and First Lady.</i>

33:31.634 --> 33:33.886
The White House counsel wouldn't
be manipulating testimony

33:33.886 --> 33:36.055
without explicit direction
from the Oval Office.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.557
And just as disconcerting is the fact
that our president is seeking

33:38.557 --> 33:41.977
psychological treatment, and chose to
hide this from the American people.

33:41.977 --> 33:44.312
If we can't trust him about that,
how do we know he wasn't involved

33:44.312 --> 33:48.233
in a money laundering scheme?
How do we know he's mentally fit to lead?

33:48.233 --> 33:51.903
And most important, how can he
enforce the law when he's breaking it?

33:51.903 --> 33:54.864
I believe our colleagues in the
House certainly have enough

33:54.864 --> 33:56.490
to consider
articles of impeachment.

33:56.490 --> 33:59.743
Both trust and laws
have been broken.

33:59.743 --> 34:05.248
Whatever the House decides to do,
we must hold this president accountable.

34:05.248 --> 34:08.418
Fully support the president, will stand
by him no matter what comes his way.

34:08.418 --> 34:11.212
Put that in, put it out.
And get me Ayla Sayyad.

34:11.212 --> 34:14.715
And as for Remy, let's let him
wither on the vine a little longer.

34:14.715 --> 34:17.384
In the meantime, have his better
half come by the house tomorrow.

34:17.384 --> 34:21.263
- Raymond?
- No, Jackie.

34:25.851 --> 34:28.311
Mr. Tusk.

34:39.321 --> 34:43.574
Well, Ms. Dunbar,
in 67 years on this planet,

34:43.574 --> 34:46.661
I have never once
been issued a subpoena.

34:46.661 --> 34:50.415
I can now cross that
off my bucket list.

34:50.415 --> 34:54.126
This interview is being
recorded and sealed.

34:54.126 --> 34:58.130
As the subpoena mentioned,
Mr. Tusk, I spoke with Xander Feng.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.383
He verified that you were
his partner in laundering Chinese money

35:01.383 --> 35:05.137
to political
super PACs since 2005.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.972
How would you respond
to his allegations?

35:06.972 --> 35:11.643
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

35:11.643 --> 35:15.146
Did you ever use these contributions
to bargain for political favors?

35:15.146 --> 35:18.482
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

35:18.482 --> 35:20.651
What was your relationship
with Daniel Lanagin?

35:20.651 --> 35:24.571
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

35:39.543 --> 35:43.297
I don't even remember
why I came over here.

35:43.297 --> 35:48.343
- You mean when you first showed up?
- No, to the kitchen.

35:49.094 --> 35:51.137
I'm sorry.

35:51.137 --> 35:55.016
- Please don't think that I don't love you.
- Then why? I don't get it.

35:56.058 --> 35:58.185
Everything's been so fast.

35:58.185 --> 36:01.855
And...

36:01.855 --> 36:03.857
I don't know, it's hard to explain.
But I'm not ready for this...

36:03.857 --> 36:06.860
- That's bullshit.
- No, it's not.

36:06.860 --> 36:11.030
I'm still trying to figure out
this new life, and this is too confusing.

36:11.030 --> 36:13.991
This is the only thing
that's clear and you know it.

36:13.991 --> 36:16.243
You're afraid,
but it's good to be afraid...

36:16.243 --> 36:20.247
I need you to leave, OK?
For your own good.

36:20.247 --> 36:21.915
I'm just going to hurt you.

36:21.915 --> 36:23.917
I have thicker skin
than you can even imagine.

36:23.917 --> 36:26.294
Please don't make this harder
than it has to be.

36:26.294 --> 36:29.380
Everything was fine yesterday.
It's so sudden.

36:29.380 --> 36:31.591
- It's like it's coming out of nowhere.
- Well, it's not.

36:31.591 --> 36:33.050
I've been thinking
about it for a while.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.635
No, you haven't.
I would've sensed it.

36:34.635 --> 36:37.680
Would you please,
please, please just go?

36:37.680 --> 36:41.767
- Just tell me what's going on.
- I don't expect you to understand!

36:41.767 --> 36:45.020
- Maybe if you try...
- I don't want you here! OK?

36:45.020 --> 36:47.147
I don't love you
the way that you love me!

36:47.147 --> 36:51.609
I was using you because it felt good
to have you around, but it was selfish!

36:51.609 --> 36:53.861
I said the words because
I knew you wanted to hear them,

36:53.861 --> 36:56.864
but I didn't mean them and I
don't want to keep saying them.

36:56.864 --> 36:59.199
I'm gonna go for a walk
while you pack your stuff.

36:59.199 --> 37:02.619
No, I don't want anything
that's been here.

37:02.619 --> 37:04.162
Lisa.

37:25.974 --> 37:29.060
<i>There was a steaming</i>
<i>mist in all the hollows,</i>

37:29.060 --> 37:32.271
<i>and it had roamed in its</i>
<i>forlornness up the hill,</i>

37:32.271 --> 37:37.276
<i>like an evil spirit,</i>
<i>seeking rest and finding none.</i>

37:37.276 --> 37:40.946
<i>A clammy</i>
<i>and intensely cold mist...</i>

37:40.946 --> 37:45.992
<i>...it made its slow way through</i>
<i>the air in ripples that visibly followed...</i>

37:45.992 --> 37:51.998
<i>and overspread one another, as the waves
of an unwholesome sea might do.</i>

37:51.998 --> 37:56.794
<i>It was dense enough to shut out everything
from the light of the coach-lamps...</i>

37:56.794 --> 37:58.629
I'm surprised you wanted
to speak to me.

37:58.629 --> 38:01.673
I haven't been the biggest
friend of the administration.

38:01.673 --> 38:04.468
Isn't that the very best
reason to speak with you?

38:04.468 --> 38:08.847
- I'd like to begin recording.
- By all means.

38:08.847 --> 38:12.350
A number of political analysts predict
that the House Judiciary Committee

38:12.350 --> 38:14.310
will commence with hearings
on articles of impeachment.

38:14.310 --> 38:18.772
Let's just stop right there.
So these analysts you speak of,

38:18.772 --> 38:22.985
they're making predictions prior to
Dunbar's report even being released.

38:22.985 --> 38:24.736
That could take months.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.488
There's no way the Judiciary
will sit on this for that long.

38:26.488 --> 38:29.407
And isn't that the fundamental
flaw with these hearings?

38:29.407 --> 38:32.952
The Committee feels compelled
to act because of hypotheses

38:32.952 --> 38:35.663
advanced by those in the media,
such as yourself.

38:35.663 --> 38:39.958
I can't speak for all of my colleagues,
but I'm just reporting facts.

38:39.958 --> 38:45.589
Well, you may call them facts,
but if we're being honest...

38:45.589 --> 38:48.800
In every article and interview,
I report alleged activities.

38:48.800 --> 38:54.013
And if you repeat allegations enough,
again and over and over and over,

38:54.013 --> 38:56.974
people start to believe they're
true. That's human nature.

38:56.974 --> 39:00.310
I've done my research. Xander Feng
admitted to the money laundering.

39:00.310 --> 39:03.563
But you're no longer writing
about Xander Feng, are you?

39:03.563 --> 39:05.524
You're writing about
the administration.

39:05.524 --> 39:08.651
The truth is these hearings have
been initiated by the press.

39:08.651 --> 39:11.863
And my fear is that the President
will be tried by the press.

39:11.863 --> 39:13.823
- Do you believe he's innocent?
- Absolutely.

39:13.823 --> 39:16.909
I said so in my written
statement, and I say so again now.

39:16.909 --> 39:20.287
The White House counsel has denied
coaching Dr. Larkin, but according...

39:20.287 --> 39:25.208
Whatever comes to light, it will only
prove the president's innocence,

39:25.208 --> 39:26.918
and I'll tell you why.

39:26.918 --> 39:30.338
I have never known anyone
more honest, ethical,

39:30.338 --> 39:33.174
and patriotic
than Garrett Walker.

39:33.174 --> 39:36.802
His reverence for the Constitution
and the laws of this country

39:36.802 --> 39:39.346
are surpassed by none.

39:39.346 --> 39:42.891
Tricia and I have been blessed
with a strong and loving marriage,

39:42.891 --> 39:46.102
but even strong marriages
face challenges.

39:46.102 --> 39:50.773
Like millions of Americans, we sought
counseling from a spiritual advisor,

39:50.773 --> 39:53.818
one who happened also
to be a professional therapist.

39:53.818 --> 39:58.614
Over the years, we have often turned
to our faith in times of adversity.

39:58.614 --> 40:00.616
Many have criticized us,

40:00.616 --> 40:04.327
<i>but would you rather have</i>
<i>a president that doesn't ask for help?</i>

40:04.327 --> 40:07.455
<i>I ask for help</i>
<i>from my wife every day.</i>

40:07.455 --> 40:11.167
<i>We've relied on one another</i>
<i>for 23 years,</i>

40:11.167 --> 40:13.753
<i>we've raised two beautiful</i>
<i>children together,</i>

40:13.753 --> 40:17.339
<i>endured the</i>
<i>campaign trails together.</i>

40:17.339 --> 40:21.552
From the state capital in
Denver, to the nation's capital,

40:21.552 --> 40:24.930
we've always been
at each other's side.

40:24.930 --> 40:29.851
I married this man for the same reason
that so many of you voted for him:

40:29.851 --> 40:32.145
because he's a man of God,

40:32.145 --> 40:34.397
because he believes in family...

40:34.397 --> 40:37.566
<i>...because he is</i>
<i>compassionate and loving.</i>

40:37.566 --> 40:40.819
<i>Now, none of us are</i>
<i>perfect: I'm not, Tricia's not,</i>

40:40.819 --> 40:42.779
<i>although she certainly</i>
<i>comes close.</i>

40:42.779 --> 40:44.114
Good morning, Mr. Feng.

40:44.114 --> 40:47.617
I won't ignore
what makes me human,

40:47.617 --> 40:49.953
that's a form of blindness.

40:49.953 --> 40:54.707
Good leadership means tackling
my imperfections head on.

40:54.707 --> 40:57.334
Not bad for a man on the run.

40:57.334 --> 40:59.461
You mean a man with immunity.

40:59.461 --> 41:03.799
Wherever you're most comfortable.
We have a lot to discuss.

41:03.799 --> 41:07.010
<i>I do so with open eyes,</i>

41:07.010 --> 41:12.473
just as I love with open eyes...

41:12.473 --> 41:17.144
...my wife,
my Maker and my country.

41:22.024 --> 41:23.817
Come in.

41:26.736 --> 41:28.613
Thank you, Meechum.

41:28.613 --> 41:32.241
Jackie, in these circumstances,
normally I would come to you,

41:32.241 --> 41:35.870
but we need to keep a public
distance for the time being.

41:35.870 --> 41:39.540
I thought I was here to discuss
the sexual assault bill.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.709
- You are.
- Among other things.

41:42.709 --> 41:45.796
I see.

41:45.796 --> 41:49.257
- There's a price.
- We don't think of it that way.

41:49.257 --> 41:52.010
I'm going to support your bill,
no matter what you say today.

41:52.010 --> 41:56.180
- Regarding?
- Impeachment.

41:56.180 --> 42:00.351
- Well, if it goes to the Judiciary...
- It most definitely will.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.353
I'm not sure about that. Did you
see the president's address?

42:03.353 --> 42:05.272
- We did.
- I think it will help,

42:05.272 --> 42:08.650
stop the bleeding.
Impeachment can be defeated.

42:08.650 --> 42:10.944
But that's what
we need to avoid.

42:10.944 --> 42:13.905
You want impeachment.

42:13.905 --> 42:16.782
Why fight a losing battle?

42:16.782 --> 42:19.451
- We have a majority in the House.
- We do now,

42:19.451 --> 42:24.790
but not if this party fails to distance
itself from a toxic president...

42:24.790 --> 42:26.458
We're thinking ahead here.

42:26.458 --> 42:28.793
It's why I came to you
about the bill,

42:28.793 --> 42:31.170
because it wasn't worth
burning a bridge over.

42:31.170 --> 42:35.424
In the long run, we have
a lot more to gain by working together.

42:35.424 --> 42:38.552
I don't understand. You said
in the <i> Telegraph</i> article...

42:38.552 --> 42:42.306
I had to. My office is three
doors down from the president's,

42:42.306 --> 42:44.599
I can't publicly deride him.

42:46.184 --> 42:47.769
You want me to do it.

42:49.646 --> 42:55.359
We want you to do what
you do so well: whip the votes.

43:04.368 --> 43:06.536
I can't abandon the president.

43:06.536 --> 43:11.291
If the party rescues him, we'll lose
50 seats in the House in the midterms.

43:11.291 --> 43:13.709
You will lose your position
in the leadership

43:13.709 --> 43:18.214
and it will take us a decade to
regain the trust of the electorate.

43:18.214 --> 43:21.008
All we're asking
is that you have an open mind.

43:21.008 --> 43:25.887
Claire kept an open mind and you'll
pass sexual assault reform as a result.

43:25.887 --> 43:29.974
- You can't possibly compare impeachment...
- It's an illustration, Jackie,

43:29.974 --> 43:32.935
of what the future looks like.

43:32.935 --> 43:36.647
What we offer is progress,

43:36.647 --> 43:40.150
with a promise of more to come.

43:41.860 --> 43:45.072
It's only the beginning, Jackie.

43:45.072 --> 43:47.824
Ruthless pragmatism, remember?

43:47.824 --> 43:49.826
That's why I wanted you
to be the whip.

43:49.826 --> 43:53.246
The three of us,
we're cut from the same cloth.

43:55.956 --> 44:00.461
Mr. Vice President,
what you're asking

44:00.461 --> 44:03.046
is just shy of treason.

44:04.840 --> 44:08.927
Just shy, which is politics.

44:12.221 --> 44:14.974
Oh, be careful, it's delicate.

44:17.226 --> 44:19.019
What is it?

44:19.019 --> 44:22.564
Something I've been working on
for a very long time,

44:22.564 --> 44:25.942
and it's nearly finished.

44:25.942 --> 44:31.406
Jackie... help us finish it.

44:35.451 --> 46:57.706
