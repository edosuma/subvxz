TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.240 --> 00:05.799
-Gentlemen.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.119
We have a new guy.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.359
Ben Tickle.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.320
First year couldn't contain
his mad skills, so

00:10.359 --> 00:11.560
he's been bumped up.

00:11.599 --> 00:12.800
-Call me Benster.

00:12.839 --> 00:14.519
-No one gets to pick their
own nick name, Ben.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.880
-She's awesome.

00:15.919 --> 00:18.399
-Last year, it was like I broke
up with ballet, and I

00:18.440 --> 00:20.800
didn't think it would hurt
so much, but it did.

00:20.839 --> 00:22.640
-If it helps, I miss it too.

00:22.679 --> 00:25.079
-You want to be a hot shot
choreographer and you want to

00:25.120 --> 00:27.640
be it right this second, but
you're not good enough.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.719
You're not ready yet.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.480
You're a Karamakov,
do you understand?

00:30.519 --> 00:32.719
People will be watching you.

00:32.759 --> 00:33.759
-I want you.

00:33.799 --> 00:35.200
Not Tara Or Grace.

00:35.240 --> 00:39.200
This piece needs to be angry and
messed up, and no one does

00:39.240 --> 00:40.439
that better than you.

00:40.479 --> 00:41.600
-OK, why didn't you
come with me?

00:41.640 --> 00:42.799
Why didn't you compromise?

00:42.840 --> 00:44.280
-Because this is important.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.560
-Exactly.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.399
And I wouldn't ask you to
give up something that's

00:46.439 --> 00:47.479
important to you.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.399
[music playing]

00:53.280 --> 00:54.240
-Who's that?

00:54.280 --> 00:55.280
-It's Kayla.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.799
The one you should be
looking out for.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.759
[music playing]

01:02.359 --> 01:03.640
-I'm sorry I bailed
on you tonight.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.400
[theme music]

01:20.680 --> 01:24.239
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:24.280 --> 01:28.200
Close your eyes.

01:28.239 --> 01:32.599
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.560
This is my chance!

01:38.599 --> 01:39.560
This is my chance!

01:39.599 --> 01:42.120
My chance to feel alive.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.760
TARA NARRATING: I never had
a crush on Christian.

01:58.799 --> 02:01.760
He kind of just snuck up on me
and then didn't go away.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.199
Sort of like permanent texta.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.800
Even if I was to rub
it off, the trace

02:14.840 --> 02:16.159
would still be there.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.639
Like he's a part of
who I am now.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.560
It just hit me.

02:28.599 --> 02:30.360
-I'm in love.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.639
-What?

02:31.680 --> 02:32.800
-Oh, that's disgusting.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.400
Get your snot away from me.

02:39.639 --> 02:42.280
TARA NARRATING: Top of the
roller coaster, full on,

02:42.319 --> 02:44.199
hopelessly, unequivocally
in love.

02:46.759 --> 02:48.120
Crap.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.400
-Behold, parentals, a B minus.

02:54.439 --> 02:56.560
I believe the word is,
unprecedented.

02:56.599 --> 02:57.960
-See how well she's doing?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.479
-Technically, it's still the
middle of the bell curve.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.639
-What's up?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.599
-I've been invited to Berlin
to do my version of the

03:04.639 --> 03:08.680
Firebird with your mother
as principal.

03:08.719 --> 03:10.280
-Wow congrats guys.

03:10.319 --> 03:12.599
That's exactly two months we've
managed to be a normal,

03:12.639 --> 03:14.080
stable family.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.439
Which is why we're all going to
make the decision together.

03:16.479 --> 03:20.159
-You remember how much you love
Berlin when you were 10?

03:20.199 --> 03:22.800
-I was eight and I got
adult chicken pox.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.240
-The schools there have an
outstanding art program.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.360
-How wonderful.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.680
Can they paper mache me
some new friends?

03:33.240 --> 03:33.800
It's fine.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.680
Go.

03:34.719 --> 03:35.800
Flit.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.800
I'll stay here with Ethan.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.039
-Uh, no.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.159
Not while you're still at
school and only 16.

03:40.199 --> 03:42.639
-It's Berlin or boarding.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.240
-Or I stay here.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.159
-I appreciate the attempt at
democracy, but I think the UN

03:48.199 --> 03:49.759
might declare it a sham.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.800
TARA NARRATING: OK, crap isn't
the normal reaction.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.280
Maybe he feels exactly
the same way.

04:00.319 --> 04:01.240
-Christian.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.080
-Yeah?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.599
-What are you thinking about?

04:03.639 --> 04:04.280
-Chicken.

04:04.319 --> 04:05.560
-Like, on a burger or?

04:05.599 --> 04:06.639
TARA NARRATING: Maybe not,
but it doesn't matter.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.800
If I feel it, I have
to say it.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.800
Be brave, Tara.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.599
-I love--

04:11.639 --> 04:13.479
I love those sneakers.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.639
-The ones I've been using
for like over a year?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.399
-Yeah, they're really
growing on me.

04:17.439 --> 04:19.199
TARA NARRATING: Wimp.

04:19.240 --> 04:19.800
-Christian?

04:19.839 --> 04:21.160
-Yeah?

04:21.199 --> 04:21.519
-Um--

04:21.560 --> 04:22.120
-Kayla.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.600
-Cheddar!

04:23.639 --> 04:25.399
-What are you doing here?

04:25.439 --> 04:26.079
-Didn't you know?

04:26.120 --> 04:27.720
I'm a student here now.

04:27.759 --> 04:29.240
-Are you serious?

04:29.279 --> 04:31.319
-No, idiot, I'm looking
for you.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.199
I'm trying to put together
a crew for our

04:33.240 --> 04:34.319
Showcase -Oh, cool.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.160
Some of your friends
are entering that.

04:36.199 --> 04:39.399
-Um, Cheds, I'm kinda freaking
out, because everyone here is

04:39.439 --> 04:40.360
totally professional.

04:40.399 --> 04:41.839
-Look, you're going
to kill it.

04:41.879 --> 04:44.319
-OK, well, don't get a big head
or anything, but I was

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
kinda wondering what
was missing, and I

04:46.399 --> 04:48.199
figured it was you.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.439
Uh, I could easily
teach you the

04:50.480 --> 04:51.920
choreography this afternoon.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.160
-Well, I'm gonna have to check
my schedule because I'm just

04:55.199 --> 04:56.600
jam packed full of stuff.

04:56.639 --> 04:57.600
-Shut up!

04:57.639 --> 04:59.079
-You seriously thought
I'd say no?

04:59.120 --> 05:00.319
-Yeah.

05:00.360 --> 05:03.560
Cheds, I owe you.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.480
I love you.

05:06.519 --> 05:07.680
Ha!

05:10.439 --> 05:12.480
-What?

05:12.519 --> 05:15.639
-She loves you and she didn't
say one word to me.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.680
-She doesn't know you.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.600
You guys haven't spent
any time together.

05:21.639 --> 05:23.600
[music playing]

05:48.439 --> 05:49.800
-So?

05:49.839 --> 05:51.399
-Yeah, it's good.

05:51.439 --> 05:53.240
I was just thinking,
though, the

05:53.279 --> 05:55.480
music needs to be different.

05:55.519 --> 05:56.360
Fuller, somehow.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.319
-I like your music.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.759
-Thanks.

05:59.800 --> 06:04.680
But with the right song, and
maybe some lyrics, you could

06:04.720 --> 06:06.839
really be something, you know?

06:06.879 --> 06:09.600
Then it'd be better than good.

06:09.639 --> 06:10.800
It'd be--

06:10.839 --> 06:13.199
-Perfect.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.040
-You guys should
call it a day.

06:15.079 --> 06:17.319
You don't want to mess
with perfection.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.480
-If you're that bored, there
is the outside world.

06:19.519 --> 06:24.040
-It's just as Showcase
crazy out there.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.560
-Again?

06:25.600 --> 06:26.759
-Yippee.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.800
-When I think of Showcase, I
think of hip hop and hot girls

06:39.839 --> 06:41.160
chanting my name.

06:41.199 --> 06:44.319
And I don't think of tap dancing
around in bowler hats.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.759
-It's steampunk.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
-Yeah, Ben, you keep saying that
word, but it doesn't make

06:46.839 --> 06:47.319
anymore sense.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.120
Like--

06:48.160 --> 06:50.199
-Ah, it's, uh, retro style.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.040
Mostly influenced by the fashion
of the steam age, but

06:53.079 --> 06:54.199
with a futuristic twist.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.360
Kind of Sherlock Holmes
meets Astro Boy.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.600
-And I think we've found
our damsel in distress.

06:58.639 --> 06:59.360
-Mm.

06:59.399 --> 07:00.439
-Oh, didn't you hear, Ben?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.399
We damsels don't do
distress anymore.

07:02.439 --> 07:04.360
-And that is exactly why
we need your input.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.439
-I'm going to try this
on, but I'm not

07:08.480 --> 07:09.639
going to make any promises.

07:15.079 --> 07:16.680
[music playing]

07:28.279 --> 07:29.519
-Nice.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.720
-Cheds, bringing you in was
a stroke of genius.

07:31.759 --> 07:34.079
-Calling yourself a genius
now, are you?

07:34.120 --> 07:34.680
-Kaylah?

07:34.720 --> 07:35.439
He won't tell me.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.040
Why do you call him Cheds?

07:38.079 --> 07:39.279
-Um--

07:41.399 --> 07:43.639
it's private.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.839
-Good call.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.519
[music playing]

08:26.480 --> 08:28.519
-I'm leaving in two weeks.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.199
But I've arranged for the
company to keep you on.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.799
-You didn't need to do that.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.799
If they want me to re-interview
on my own merits,

08:37.840 --> 08:38.799
then I can.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.279
-You've moved out.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.399
I think that's enough
independence for now.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.679
Your Showcase opposition.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.480
They're strong.

08:47.519 --> 08:49.519
-Yeah, but how many dancers
do they need?

08:49.559 --> 08:51.320
-It's a spectacular.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.440
And that's what turns
heads at Showcase.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.559
-They run as hip hop.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.240
I'm going a different way.

08:57.279 --> 08:59.799
-Well, then, I can't
wait to see it.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.679
-You're coming?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.159
Why?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.320
So you can gloat if I get
laughed off stage?

09:05.360 --> 09:09.240
-You think you'll get laughed
off the stage?

09:09.279 --> 09:11.039
You know I think you should have
waited before you debuted

09:11.080 --> 09:11.720
your choreography.

09:11.759 --> 09:12.600
-Yeah, yeah.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.399
To protect the Kamarakov
brand.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.159
-But you didn't.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.320
You took the riskier path.

09:19.639 --> 09:21.159
Let's see if it pays off.

09:34.039 --> 09:34.759
-Seriously?

09:34.799 --> 09:36.360
Hip hop?

09:36.399 --> 09:38.360
-I need to be more street.

09:38.399 --> 09:39.639
-Oh.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.679
Hey, you're country lane,
winding road at best.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.519
Street?

09:43.559 --> 09:44.759
Never.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.480
-Well, Kaylah's street.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.039
-Christian's Kaylah?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.639
You have nothing to be
worried about there.

09:49.679 --> 09:50.399
-I'm not.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.600
It's just, she knows him.

09:51.639 --> 09:53.559
She knew his mom, his brother.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.039
That stuff counts.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.200
-Well, she's probably
just jealous.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.559
She, she has the history,
but you have the

09:59.600 --> 10:01.440
present, and the future.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.639
Now, can we discuss important
issues, like what we're doing

10:04.679 --> 10:06.559
for my sleepover tonight?

10:06.600 --> 10:07.360
-You're sleeping over?

10:07.399 --> 10:08.559
Hooray!

10:08.600 --> 10:10.279
-Oh, that was super uncool.

10:10.320 --> 10:10.799
-Yeah.

10:10.840 --> 10:11.720
Drop the hooray?

10:11.759 --> 10:13.399
-Maybe just in front
of Kaylah.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.279
-Wicked.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.000
Wicked.

10:15.039 --> 10:15.759
Wicked.

10:15.799 --> 10:16.440
Wicked?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.120
-Um, we'll work on it.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.559
-Where were you last night, and
what did I tell you about

10:25.600 --> 10:27.240
leaving the phone on?

10:27.279 --> 10:30.200
-You know, you'd be completely
justified in asking that if

10:30.240 --> 10:32.120
you weren't packing
for overseas.

10:32.159 --> 10:34.720
Kind of undermines the whole
nurturing mother thing.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.159
-These aren't going overseas.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.200
I'm putting them in storage.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.559
I've decided to retire before
the offers start drying up.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.039
-There'll be others, Mom.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.679
-Oh, at my age, once you turn
something down, people start

10:45.720 --> 10:47.440
smelling blood.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.679
Besides, it's time.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.559
-You need four encores
and a bouquet before

10:51.600 --> 10:52.759
you leave the stage.

10:52.799 --> 10:54.759
Natasha Willis doesn't retire.

10:54.799 --> 10:56.559
-It happens to every dancer.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.159
I'm lucky I've held
it off this long.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.639
Now, stop trying to
change my mind.

11:00.679 --> 11:02.360
-I, I wasn't.

11:02.399 --> 11:03.559
-Good.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.360
Because I have a new role
I'm committed to.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.279
I'm staying here with you.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.639
Now, let's get on with it.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.000
-Found it.

11:15.039 --> 11:16.360
You know I don't believe
in fate, but this

11:16.399 --> 11:17.759
song is meant to be.

11:17.799 --> 11:19.240
-Thanks, Abigail.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.639
Now, listen.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.159
-What's this?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.440
-Well, I woke up this morning
and I realized that with you,

11:24.480 --> 11:25.759
the piece is fine.

11:25.799 --> 11:30.559
But with five dancers, it's
going to be spectacular.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.600
Right?

11:32.639 --> 11:33.720
-There's no time to change it.

11:33.759 --> 11:34.840
-Oh, no.

11:34.879 --> 11:35.519
Everyone's picking it
up really quickly.

11:35.559 --> 11:36.799
-Yay, everyone.

11:36.840 --> 11:37.799
-I know.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.480
You can help show them
the "chori."

11:41.519 --> 11:44.559
-So, I'm a massive hypocrite?

11:44.600 --> 11:45.879
-Sorry?

11:45.919 --> 11:47.399
-You know, running down
Showcase, then single white

11:47.440 --> 11:49.600
femaling you when your
back's turned?

11:49.639 --> 11:50.600
Not at all.

11:50.639 --> 11:51.799
The more the merrier.

11:57.799 --> 12:00.320
-That's great, everyone.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.320
Uh--

12:01.360 --> 12:02.480
Abigail, just loosen
up a little bit.

12:02.519 --> 12:03.679
You've gone a bit stiff.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.759
Check out how Grace does it.

[music playing]

12:17.600 --> 12:19.720

12:21.200 --> 12:24.480
[music playing]

12:45.159 --> 12:47.200
-OK, hold it there, everyone.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.120
Take five.

12:48.159 --> 12:50.320
Abigail.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.240
Hey.

12:51.279 --> 12:52.360
What's wrong?

12:52.399 --> 12:53.759
You had it perfectly
yesterday.

12:53.799 --> 12:56.559
-Well, yesterday I didn't have
to worry about them.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.080
-Don't think about them.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.399
-Which one is it, Ethan?

12:59.440 --> 13:02.159
Dance perfectly in sync, or
don't think about them?

13:02.200 --> 13:03.559
-Don't obsess.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.279
It's the old cogs
turning again.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.799
-Maybe that's the way I dance.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.279
-It's my fault.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.159
She's making space for me.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.039
-Um, let's just go
from the top.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.240
Everyone?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.240
-Great.

13:18.279 --> 13:19.759
We're on tomorrow, and
we look like idiots.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.759
-It'll be sweet.

13:20.799 --> 13:21.759
Let's just go again
from the top.

13:21.799 --> 13:22.759
-No, there's no point.

13:22.799 --> 13:24.320
We can't do it.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.679
The transition's too fast.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.440
Maybe if you held it for
a couple of extra

13:29.480 --> 13:31.159
beats, it'd be easier.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.039
-She borrows a hoodie, and all
of a sudden she's the expert.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.360
-Get it together, guys.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.600
Running it from the top.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.480
-Tara!

13:48.519 --> 13:49.759
Wait!

13:49.799 --> 13:51.440
Where are you going?

13:51.480 --> 13:54.000
-I don't want to
be in the way.

13:54.039 --> 13:55.360
-Things are just
getting tense.

13:55.399 --> 13:58.360
I'm just trying to lighten
up the mood.

13:58.399 --> 13:59.360
-By--

13:59.399 --> 14:00.759
by putting me down?

14:00.799 --> 14:03.519
-This is a huge thing
for Kaylah.

14:03.559 --> 14:05.639
Opportunities don't just
fall in her lap.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.519
-It's not about Kaylah.

14:07.559 --> 14:11.440
It's you who doesn't
want me there.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.440
-Yeah, you're right.

14:13.480 --> 14:17.320
You know, I didn't understand
why you walked up today.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.279
So what if you don't fit in?

14:19.320 --> 14:20.759
Those people up there?

14:20.799 --> 14:22.480
They're important to me,
and I'm just going

14:22.519 --> 14:24.679
to give them up.

14:24.720 --> 14:28.759
-I'm not asking you to.

-Thanks.

I think I just bought myself a
ticket for the world's longest

14:40.200 --> 14:42.480
guilt trip.

14:42.519 --> 14:46.759
So, you're nervous
about tomorrow.

14:46.799 --> 14:50.519
-Well, I wasn't, until Abigail
decided to go into meltdown.

14:50.559 --> 14:53.279
She was perfect, and
then all I did was

14:53.320 --> 14:55.320
add a couple of dancers.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.320
Barely touched the "chori." I
don't know what happened.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.159
-Aw.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.080
Here.

-I said, are you ready?

15:18.600 --> 15:19.559
Yeah!

15:19.600 --> 15:21.120
Hello, dance freaks.

15:21.159 --> 15:23.519
Welcome to Showcase.

15:23.559 --> 15:27.279
The best choreographers,
the baddest dancers.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.039
It's a huge program.

You're here.

16:09.399 --> 16:10.360
-Yeah, just for Sammy and Kat.

16:10.399 --> 16:12.759
I don't want to get
in your way.

16:12.799 --> 16:14.120
Good luck.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.799
-Have to say, I'm really
digging the mustache.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.759
-Don't try and grow
one, Samuel.

16:20.799 --> 16:22.279
Imagine the humiliation.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.399
-You guys are going to rock.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.399
-Oh, it's steampunk.

We don't rock, we swing
and cavort.

-Where's Grace and the others?

17:31.079 --> 17:32.359
-They're not coming.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.160
-What?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.599
-I told them not to.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.599
Look, I'm an idiot, OK?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.559
I'm competitive and paranoid,
and I panicked.

17:39.599 --> 17:40.559
There's nothing wrong
with what we had.

17:40.599 --> 17:43.559
You, by yourself, that's
spectacular.

17:43.599 --> 17:45.119
-You decide this now?

17:45.160 --> 17:46.480
-Well, it's better
as a solo, right?

17:46.519 --> 17:47.359
-Yeah.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.839
It was.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.599
Until you made me rehearse it in
a completely different way.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.200
How am I supposed to go out
there on my own when the

17:53.240 --> 17:55.000
choreographer doesn't even have
a clue what he's doing?

17:57.480 --> 18:00.079
-But you're still gonna
dance, right?

18:00.119 --> 18:01.279
I'm using your music.

-Darling, you were wonderful.

18:22.599 --> 18:26.359
-Oh, it was a bit wonderful,
wasn't it?

18:26.400 --> 18:29.200
I'd forgotten what
that was like.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.160
You have to go to Berlin.

-No, we've been over this.

18:32.799 --> 18:33.720
-No.

18:33.759 --> 18:34.759
Performing is who
you are, Mom.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.559
You'd miss it way too much.

18:36.599 --> 18:39.200
Plus, I don't need a million
ballet freaks blaming me for

18:39.240 --> 18:40.160
your disappearance.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.559
-What about you?

18:42.599 --> 18:45.359
-Well, boarding school's
not that bad.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.799
And so what if we're not
a normal family?

18:48.839 --> 18:50.519
I don't want you giving
up what you love the

18:50.559 --> 18:51.920
most just for me.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.079
-Dancing has never been what
I love the most, Katrina.

18:56.119 --> 19:00.279
Maybe you could stay
with Ethan.

19:00.319 --> 19:01.599
-Seriously?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.799
-If you give up this fabulous
display of maturity.

19:03.839 --> 19:06.759
-Excuse me, sorry to interrupt,
but I really loved

19:06.799 --> 19:08.279
what you did out there.

19:08.319 --> 19:10.359
And look, I always looking for
versatile commercial dancers,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.599
so why don't you
give me a call?

19:12.640 --> 19:15.079
-No, I, I, I'm really
not a dancer.

19:15.119 --> 19:17.079
-Can I disagree with
you on that?

19:17.119 --> 19:18.279
-Yes, you may.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.599
-Tara.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.079
Hey, listen.

19:31.119 --> 19:31.720
-OK?

19:31.759 --> 19:32.599
-She won't come out.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.559
She's been in there for ages.

19:35.599 --> 19:36.400
-Aren't you guys on soon?

19:36.440 --> 19:37.599
-Yeah, in like two minutes.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.759
-Kaylah?

19:53.119 --> 19:58.400
You know, last year I refused to
go on stage because someone

19:58.440 --> 20:00.160
stole my costume.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.240
There was a spare, but it
wasn't my lucky one.

20:03.279 --> 20:05.720
So I held the performance
up for 10 minutes.

20:05.759 --> 20:06.519
-Wow.

20:06.559 --> 20:08.680
-We have so much in common.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.880
-I'm serious.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.559
Every time I have to go
on stage, I'm a wreck.

20:11.599 --> 20:15.519
I'm convinced that everything
is going to fall apart.

20:15.559 --> 20:16.599
-How did you get over it?

20:16.640 --> 20:18.720
-Trust that I know it.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.400
And try not to think
so much about it.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.640
-And they teach you that
stuff at the academy?

20:24.680 --> 20:26.519
-Sort of.

20:26.559 --> 20:30.720
-See, that's why I wanted
Christian's help.

20:30.759 --> 20:34.720
I mean, ever since he's been
here with you, he's so much

20:34.759 --> 20:37.319
better than he used to be.

20:37.359 --> 20:39.519
I guess I thought some of
that would rub off.

20:39.559 --> 20:41.119
-You don't need it.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.640
Even without him,
you're amazing.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.720
-Says the hip hop expert.

20:44.759 --> 20:48.559
-Hey, I've got the hoodie
to prove it.

20:48.599 --> 20:50.039
So are you going out there?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.039

Hey.

Ethan said you're
freaking out.

22:05.599 --> 22:06.720
-I'm not freaking out.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.599
Why would I be freaking out?

22:07.640 --> 22:08.720
I'm not freaking out.

22:08.759 --> 22:10.240
-Breathe.

22:10.279 --> 22:13.720
Look, I know you hate losing
control, so if you need

22:13.759 --> 22:15.359
someone to dance with,
I don't mind.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.319
I've got my costume
right here.

what's in your heart arrives
without warning.

22:41.799 --> 22:43.400
-I love you, too.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.440
TARA NARRATING: And something
you've been hiding is finally

22:45.480 --> 22:48.319
out there for everyone to see.

22:48.359 --> 22:51.720
And it's more than OK.

22:51.759 --> 22:53.119
It's perfect.
