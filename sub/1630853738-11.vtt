12:01.329 --> 12:03.200
when you ask me questions?No,

12:03.244 --> 12:05.289
this is the part where I try to
understand your cause, Violet.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.682

all about?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.466
Genetic
experiments,

12:08.510 --> 12:10.468
the Vatican, Genghis Khan.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.166
This is not you.

12:12.209 --> 12:15.647
You were all about getting rich,
not about planning genocide.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.475
Have I told you
about what it was like

12:17.519 --> 12:20.130
growing up in Kowloon?I know you
were poor.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.786
I know you worked for some
snobby, rich Hong Kong family.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.745
Well, I was a companion.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.443
And that's a nice word
for being a slave.

12:28.486 --> 12:32.099
I had no shoes,
no bed, no clothes

12:32.142 --> 12:34.188
except for what was on my back.

12:34.231 --> 12:38.061
And I walked that little brat
to school every day

12:38.105 --> 12:40.847
and came back
and scrubbed their toilets.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.589
Sunrise to sunset.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.157

12:49.203 --> 12:51.161

12:52.902 --> 12:54.991
I am.

12:55.035 --> 12:58.168
All this time I've known you...

12:58.212 --> 13:01.258
and not once have you
ever mentioned Genghis Khan.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.043
I don't get it.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.480
Did prison do
this to you?

13:05.523 --> 13:08.265
Did you know that Genghis Khan
was an orphan

13:08.309 --> 13:12.313
that came from nothing and then
conquered half the world?

13:12.356 --> 13:14.924
You know,
when I was in prison,

13:14.968 --> 13:17.753
I'd watch all the little gangs
fighting each other for power.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.757
And then I realized,
if we all became one big gang,

13:21.801 --> 13:24.716
we'd be an unstoppable army.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.806
And so the Great Khan was born.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.200
Yeah.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.333
Then the CIA came calling.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.205
Infiltrating terrorist cells
was hard,

13:35.249 --> 13:37.207
so they figured
getting into the gangs

13:37.251 --> 13:39.688
that they sometimes worked with
was easier.

13:39.731 --> 13:42.647
And they came to me
for help getting in.

13:42.691 --> 13:46.173
They underestimated me.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.175
They didn't realize
I was the one in charge

13:48.218 --> 13:51.178
until it was too late.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.920
By then
I'd already flipped the handler,

13:53.963 --> 13:57.140

from their past,

13:57.184 --> 13:59.534

So it's safe to assume
that the gas was laced

35:44.881 --> 35:46.405
with a DNA-targeted virus.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.233
Thankfully for us,
your message arrived in time

35:48.276 --> 35:51.323
for us to issue a citywide
shelter-in-place order.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.194
We're not exactly sure

35:53.238 --> 35:54.630
how many people
were affected,

35:54.674 --> 35:56.371
but it could have been
much worse.

35:56.415 --> 35:57.503
This way.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.113
There is more happening.

36:00.941 --> 36:03.552
We started getting alerts
from across the globe

36:03.596 --> 36:05.293
about an hour ago.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.208
Moderate at first.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.819
Citywide cell tower
failure in Sydney.

36:09.863 --> 36:13.780
DWP malfunction
in Tehran and Baghdad.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.912
Coordinated cyberattacks?Yes.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.653
Then the targets got bigger.

36:17.697 --> 36:21.222
Air traffic control went down
in all of Spain.

36:21.266 --> 36:25.052
Director, OT Alert
coming from the United States.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.359
Power outages reported
in New York,

36:27.402 --> 36:28.969
New Jersey, Pennsylvania...

36:29.012 --> 36:29.926
Get me the director

36:29.970 --> 36:31.363
at Langley.Trying.

36:31.406 --> 36:32.842
There's cell
and Internet interference

36:32.886 --> 36:34.844
that's overriding
communications.

36:34.888 --> 36:35.932
BECKER:
Where?

36:37.412 --> 36:39.632
AGENT:
Everywhere.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.070
BECKER:
Everything is frozen!

36:43.113 --> 36:45.072
Someone is hacking
into our system.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.335
[electrical crackling]

36:47.379 --> 36:51.296
DISTORTED VOICE: This is
a message from the Great Khan.

36:51.339 --> 36:55.082
The long dominance of the West
is at an end.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.084
Is this signal local?

36:57.127 --> 36:58.694
This is not a warning.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.349
It is a declaration of war.

37:01.393 --> 37:03.569
It is being broadcast
all over the world.

37:03.612 --> 37:07.660
50 years ago, the West
tried to create a weapon

37:07.703 --> 37:10.140
of genocide against the East.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.230
They failed to make it work.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.970
I have succeeded,

37:14.014 --> 37:16.582
and have turned your own weapon
against you.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.889
My army has dispersed
a biological agent

37:19.933 --> 37:21.891
across the Western world.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.503
Only those who share
the genetic bloodline

37:24.546 --> 37:26.853
of Genghis Khan will be safe.[explosions]

37:26.896 --> 37:30.291
All others will be dead
within days.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.990
If my symbol burns in your city,
you and those you love

37:34.034 --> 37:36.079
have already been exposed.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.604
There is no cure.

37:38.647 --> 37:40.736
There is no chance of survival.

37:40.780 --> 37:45.698
Today, the greedy,
once powerful nations

37:45.741 --> 37:47.961
will finally reap
what they have sown.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.572
Your civilizations
will lie in ruins.

37:50.616 --> 37:53.009
Your sins will be repaid.

37:53.053 --> 37:57.275
You have been conquered
by the Great Khan.
