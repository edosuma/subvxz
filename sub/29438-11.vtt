10:17.841 --> 10:19.849
What are we talking about? Skydiving?

10:19.850 --> 10:22.505
Hell no. I have been tied to this chair

10:22.506 --> 10:24.616
since I was five years old; I want out.

10:24.617 --> 10:27.908
I want to fly. I want to
float like I own the place.

10:27.909 --> 10:29.702
In zero-g.

10:29.703 --> 10:31.221
Zero gravity?

10:31.222 --> 10:32.980
I sent a pandering letter to the company

10:32.981 --> 10:34.443
that does zero-g flights,

10:34.444 --> 10:37.394
and they gifted tickets for
me and a doctor of my choosing.

10:37.395 --> 10:38.814
So, you in?

10:38.815 --> 10:41.140
Guys...

10:41.141 --> 10:43.683
it is definitely crazy.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.716
Which is exactly why I'm in!

10:45.717 --> 10:47.792
Yes! Oh, let's do it.

10:51.127 --> 10:54.769
I know this is as much
for me as it is for Finn,

10:54.770 --> 10:57.446
and... I appreciate it.

10:57.447 --> 11:00.206
I had nothing to do with
it. It was all Finn's idea.

11:03.754 --> 11:05.421
- Have fun.
- (PAGER BEEPING)

11:09.743 --> 11:12.212
Mom calls them brain damage on wheels.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.412
In her ICU in Boston,
a quarter of the beds

11:14.413 --> 11:16.138
are always filled with scooter patients.

11:16.139 --> 11:18.782
- So I got off easy?
- Because you were wearing a helmet.

11:19.937 --> 11:21.604
So, how's it going with Odel?

11:21.605 --> 11:22.755
He really wanted answers,

11:22.756 --> 11:24.393
so I called Pulmonology for a consult.

11:24.394 --> 11:26.180
Dr. Langford recommended a bronchoscopy

11:26.181 --> 11:27.944
- just to be sure.
- He has a cough

11:27.945 --> 11:29.854
with clear lungs and
a normal chest X-ray.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.494
He didn't need a Pulmonology consult.

11:31.495 --> 11:32.679
EZRA: The patient wanted one.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.584
And he's about to travel.
I was in Nairobi once,

11:34.585 --> 11:36.962
- caught this nasty parasite and, um...
- Both of you, follow me.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.188
Okay.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.315
(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

11:41.316 --> 11:43.293
Well, guess we're too late.

11:43.294 --> 11:45.151
Can I help you with
something, Dr. Pravesh?

11:45.152 --> 11:46.861
This procedure is unnecessary.

11:46.862 --> 11:48.798
Step out, please.
This is now my patient.

11:48.799 --> 11:50.116
- (COUGHING)
- (ALARM BEEPING)

11:50.117 --> 11:53.067
O2 sat is dropping.

11:53.068 --> 11:54.453
He's aspirating.

11:54.454 --> 11:56.664
Turn up the suction. Get him on 100% O2

11:56.665 --> 11:58.958
and abort the bronch.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.052
- Wh-What's happening?
- He's choking on his own vomit.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.054
No invasive procedure
is completely safe.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.673
You have to weigh the
danger of a simple cough

12:05.674 --> 12:09.234
against an unintended
consequence like this one.

12:10.321 --> 12:12.321
Yikes.

12:17.995 --> 12:20.071
He's stable.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.814
- That's something.
- But he has to be admitted.

12:21.815 --> 12:23.160
He's on supplemental oxygen

12:23.161 --> 12:24.726
and will need antibiotics to treat

12:24.727 --> 12:28.269
the aspiration pneumonia caused
by an unnecessary bronchoscopy.

12:28.270 --> 12:31.375
He wanted answers. I consulted
an experienced pulmonologist

12:31.376 --> 12:32.750
who suggested the bronchoscopy.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.868
Which is a relatively benign procedure

12:34.869 --> 12:36.409
- with good diagnostic yield.
- Stop.

12:37.681 --> 12:39.331
It's simple.

12:39.332 --> 12:40.374
You made a mistake.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.093
You need to accept responsibility,

12:42.094 --> 12:44.520
learn and move on.

12:47.719 --> 12:49.268
You read Annie Diamonte's chart?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.177
Yes. I recommend

12:51.178 --> 12:53.053
you start with the good
news and finish with the bad.

12:53.054 --> 12:55.322
Well, I prefer to close on the positive.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.352
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:00.353 --> 13:02.539
You know, we really have
to stop meeting like this.

13:02.540 --> 13:06.042
You know, as much as I enjoy
seeing you, Annie, I agree.

13:06.043 --> 13:08.152
I was really hoping that last chest tube

13:08.153 --> 13:09.620
would have taken care of it,

13:09.621 --> 13:11.714
but your CT scan shows
that you still have

13:11.715 --> 13:13.049
what's called an empyema,

13:13.050 --> 13:15.218
an infection between
your lung and your chest,

13:15.219 --> 13:17.036
which is what's causing your fevers.

13:17.037 --> 13:19.222
But there's good news.

13:19.223 --> 13:20.764
We saw your scan...

13:21.852 --> 13:23.584
... and no sign of cancer.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.878
The immunotherapy is working.

13:25.879 --> 13:27.230
What?

13:27.231 --> 13:28.829
My cancer's gone?

13:28.830 --> 13:30.279
(CHUCKLES): Yeah.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.360
Well, you know, you really
should have led with that.

13:33.489 --> 13:37.114
I was gonna tell you to stop
the drugs and let me go.

13:40.077 --> 13:42.912
(CRYING)

13:42.913 --> 13:45.214
(EXHALES) So... so what's the plan?

13:45.215 --> 13:47.847
I mean, another chest
tube? New antibiotic?

13:47.848 --> 13:49.568
Well, we are actually
here to talk to you

13:49.569 --> 13:52.071
about another option. A decortication.

13:52.072 --> 13:54.907
We open your chest, then
we clear the infection,

13:54.908 --> 13:57.260
and we scrape off the peel
that's trapping your lung,

13:57.261 --> 13:59.177
which is what's making it
hard for you to breathe.

13:59.178 --> 14:01.080
What could go wrong?

14:01.081 --> 14:02.265
NIC: Plenty.

14:02.266 --> 14:03.940
This is a very high-risk surgery.

14:03.941 --> 14:05.709
There's a high likelihood of bleeding,

14:05.710 --> 14:07.666
which could be catastrophic,

14:07.667 --> 14:09.237
particularly given the trauma

14:09.238 --> 14:10.940
you've already been
through from the explosion.

14:10.941 --> 14:13.092
And even if Dr. Austin

14:13.093 --> 14:15.278
is able to do the surgery successfully,

14:15.279 --> 14:17.988
your lung may never reexpand.

14:22.038 --> 14:23.987
What are my alternatives?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.605
I mean, I live my life
in and out of here,

14:26.606 --> 14:29.700
sick and in limbo,
buy my time till I die?

14:29.701 --> 14:31.328
I can't do that.

14:31.329 --> 14:34.321
(CRYING): And if my
cancer's in remission,

14:34.322 --> 14:36.673
I have a shot at getting my life back.

14:38.285 --> 14:40.828
You do understand the risks of surgery?

14:40.829 --> 14:42.472
Yeah. Well, whatever they are,

14:42.473 --> 14:45.124
I'll take my chances. (CHUCKLES)

14:45.125 --> 14:47.768
Oh, wow.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.722
<i>... for yourself or for someone else,</i>

14:51.723 --> 14:53.500
<i>this is something...</i>

14:53.501 --> 14:55.508
I'm gone a matter of weeks,

14:55.509 --> 14:57.474
you're in the servants' quarters,

14:57.475 --> 15:01.491
and my son, one of the best
doctors at Chastain, is fired?

15:01.492 --> 15:03.159
I'm not responsible for that.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.967
Obviously.

15:04.968 --> 15:07.257
Conrad is dodging my calls.

15:07.258 --> 15:09.574
His way of asking me to stand down.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.374
- Hmm. Well, stand down.
- My lawyers are submitting

15:12.375 --> 15:13.970
a whistleblower suit.

15:13.971 --> 15:16.863
You know how many are filed every year?

15:16.864 --> 15:19.917
Whistleblower protection
is a joke in Georgia.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.483
I'll tell you what'll happen.

15:21.484 --> 15:24.330
Red Rock will sue you for
libel, and they may win.

15:24.331 --> 15:27.514
So I'm taking advice from
a guy who's lost two jobs

15:27.515 --> 15:28.841
- in two weeks?
- Yeah.

15:28.842 --> 15:31.095
Being demoted by these
people is an honor.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.339
How do we fight back?

15:33.340 --> 15:35.858
Well, you got a slingshot?

15:35.859 --> 15:38.608
Look, all due respect, don't
go down that path until you have

15:38.609 --> 15:40.976
- a bulletproof strategy.
- Oh, I've got one.

15:45.450 --> 15:47.617
Well, if you're hell-bent
on moving forward,

15:47.618 --> 15:49.216
then I suggest...

15:49.217 --> 15:51.860
you have a look at Logan Kim.

15:53.234 --> 15:55.085
Thanks.

16:00.867 --> 16:02.983
Dr. Austin.

16:02.984 --> 16:04.975
Watch the coat. It's custom.

16:04.976 --> 16:06.967
I don't like wrinkles.

16:06.968 --> 16:10.068
Well, here's one. I'm
reviewing mortality outcomes

16:10.069 --> 16:13.045
of all surgeons, and you're an outlier.

16:13.046 --> 16:14.805
Your stats aren't up to par.

16:14.806 --> 16:17.066
And as chief, your outcomes
are now my outcomes.

16:17.067 --> 16:20.293
Come on, bruh. Everybody knows
that my outcomes are excellent

16:20.294 --> 16:21.963
for the kind of cases I take.

16:21.964 --> 16:24.765
My patients are the
sickest. My surgeries, risky.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.088
Which is precisely my point.

16:26.089 --> 16:28.884
Annie Diamonte's upcoming surgery
is too much of a long shot.

16:28.885 --> 16:30.729
- You need to reassess.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:30.730 --> 16:32.156
Hold up.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.826
You don't want me to do a
highly profitable procedure?

16:35.827 --> 16:38.235
- The crème de la crème of RVUs?
- I'm only suggesting

16:38.236 --> 16:39.780
that you have a plan B.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.573
An escape hatch, so to speak.

16:41.574 --> 16:44.335
Oh. So if something
catastrophic were to happen,

16:44.336 --> 16:46.412
you want me to keep
her alive at all costs,

16:46.413 --> 16:48.070
not let her die on my table,

16:48.071 --> 16:49.906
- just to pad my stats.
- What I'm saying to you,

16:49.907 --> 16:52.292
Dr. Austin, is that your statistics

16:52.293 --> 16:54.574
don't meet what I
expect from my surgeons.

16:54.575 --> 16:57.579
So, yes, you keep her alive at all costs

16:57.580 --> 17:00.015
and don't mention a DNR to your patient.

17:12.108 --> 17:14.638
As the plane descends, we'll
vary the flight profiles

17:14.640 --> 17:16.603
so you can feel the
weightlessness of both martian

17:16.604 --> 17:17.818
and lunar gravity.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.127
So this isn't a free fall.

17:19.128 --> 17:20.654
That's Kimmy.

17:20.655 --> 17:23.374
She makes these crazy
videos in the best way.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.451
She may be a living emoji. (CHUCKLES)

17:25.452 --> 17:27.136
- Shh.
- SAFETY COORDINATOR: You'll also experience...

17:27.137 --> 17:28.638
And that's Reggie Perez.

17:28.639 --> 17:31.991
Retired Atlanta United
defender, 2015 to 2017.

17:31.992 --> 17:34.385
CONRAD: Hey, you're in good company, Finn,
but they got nothing on you.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.961
You're the real badass here.

17:35.962 --> 17:38.222
Don't ever forget that.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.149
SAFETY COORDINATOR: You'll
experience 15 simulations

17:40.150 --> 17:43.302
in total in increments
of about 30 seconds a pop.

17:43.303 --> 17:45.804
Most people think that
zero-g is only experienced

17:45.805 --> 17:48.348
- when the plane is in a dive.
- Hey, Reggie.

17:48.349 --> 17:50.742
Yeah.

17:51.811 --> 17:53.802
I was MVP of the Golden Kickers

17:53.803 --> 17:55.665
till my career ended at age five.

17:55.666 --> 17:58.484
But mini-me could have
taken mini-you down.

17:58.485 --> 18:00.050
I don't doubt it for a second, bud.

18:00.051 --> 18:02.004
Well, once we're weightless,
it's an even playing field,

18:02.005 --> 18:03.645
and I am coming for you.

18:03.646 --> 18:06.033
(LAUGHS) And I'm scared.

18:06.034 --> 18:08.535
I'll see you out there.

18:08.536 --> 18:10.370
He said he's scared.

18:10.371 --> 18:11.997
Does he look scared?

18:11.998 --> 18:13.731
No.

18:13.732 --> 18:15.709
SAFETY COORDINATOR: Of course
all the rush and excitement

18:15.710 --> 18:17.169
- come with perils, like nausea.
- (CHUCKLES)

18:17.170 --> 18:19.021
It's called vomit comet for a reason.

18:19.022 --> 18:21.856
But there are also other
risks, including dizziness,

18:21.857 --> 18:23.192
fluctuating blood pressure.

18:23.193 --> 18:26.341
There are very rare but
very real complications

18:26.342 --> 18:28.486
aside from the vomit issue, of course...

18:28.487 --> 18:31.442
Are <i> you</i> scared?

18:31.443 --> 18:34.843
You can change your mind.
It's totally fine if you are.

18:34.844 --> 18:36.577
It's not, really.

18:36.578 --> 18:38.668
'Cause then I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

18:38.669 --> 18:40.618
wondering "what if".

18:40.619 --> 18:43.713
Means my final weeks would be
torture, and I can't do that.

18:43.714 --> 18:45.709
SAFETY COORDINATOR: We'll
take those signed waivers now,

18:45.710 --> 18:47.741
because it's time for zero-g, people.

18:47.742 --> 18:50.719
- (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
- (LAUGHS)

18:55.583 --> 18:57.894
One thing, though, doc.

18:57.895 --> 19:00.369
I know you've been through a lot lately,

19:00.370 --> 19:02.972
and I don't want to make it worse.

19:04.365 --> 19:07.223
Listen, if things go south up there...

19:07.224 --> 19:08.866
like really south...

19:10.482 --> 19:12.099
... don't blame yourself, okay?

19:12.100 --> 19:15.486
I mean, the worst that
happens up there is I die.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.371
And is zero-g really
the worst way to go?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.750
No, it isn't.

19:27.237 --> 19:29.908
We obviously want the
surgery to be a success.

19:29.909 --> 19:33.262
But it's risky. So we have to ask

19:33.263 --> 19:35.172
have you thought about

19:35.173 --> 19:37.457
what you want if things don't go well?

19:37.458 --> 19:41.103
I've thought about it a lot
since the cancer diagnosis.

19:41.104 --> 19:43.848
You know, I-I love the outdoors

19:43.849 --> 19:46.684
and the physical challenges.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.469
A life hooked up to a machine
is no life at all for me.

19:50.470 --> 19:53.703
So if that is my only choice,

19:53.704 --> 19:55.805
I want you to let me go.

19:56.954 --> 19:59.196
AUSTIN: Okay.

19:59.197 --> 20:02.199
Well, then let's fill out
a Do Not Resuscitate order,

20:02.200 --> 20:04.627
specifying your wishes

20:04.628 --> 20:06.461
so that everyone follows them.

20:11.784 --> 20:14.302
Before I sign that, can I have a minute?

31:24.008 --> 31:25.039
Humility.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.748
Acceptance.

31:26.749 --> 31:28.967
Those are the main
ingredients in being one.

31:31.046 --> 31:34.205
He might have coronary artery
disease that was undiagnosed

31:34.206 --> 31:36.458
and exacerbated during zero-g.

31:36.459 --> 31:40.118
Tell Dr. Feldman to give
cardiology a heads-up

31:40.119 --> 31:42.887
- that a V fib arrest with ROSC is coming in.
- Copy that.

31:46.102 --> 31:48.028
Reggie's gonna be okay, right?

31:48.029 --> 31:49.386
I believe so.

31:49.387 --> 31:51.679
FINN: 'Cause, you know, I'd feel weird

31:51.680 --> 31:53.534

31:53.535 --> 31:56.203

- that zero-g experience was, right, if...

31:56.204 --> 31:58.688
He's in great hands. It's not weird.

31:58.689 --> 32:02.117
Oh, dude, how freaking cool was that?!

32:02.118 --> 32:04.119
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

32:04.120 --> 32:06.236
I believed you when you
said we'd be floating,

32:06.237 --> 32:07.548
but I guess I didn't really believe you,

32:07.549 --> 32:09.407
because when we started to rise up...

32:09.408 --> 32:11.044
You-you almost peed yourself?

32:11.045 --> 32:13.721
- (CHUCKLING) Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, me too!

32:13.722 --> 32:15.631
Except for me wouldn't be
the first time, so no biggie,

32:15.632 --> 32:17.224
but that was incredible.

32:17.225 --> 32:19.723
Yeah. Yeah, it was. Thank you

32:19.724 --> 32:23.254
for dragging me out there.
I really needed this badly.

32:23.255 --> 32:25.148
Oh.

32:28.464 --> 32:31.647
Hey. You okay, man?

32:31.648 --> 32:34.032
I mean, really.

32:36.268 --> 32:38.578
I was so happy.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.111
I had my work and the most
amazing woman in my life.

32:46.112 --> 32:49.164
They gave me purpose.

32:49.165 --> 32:51.883
I don't know who I am right now.

32:54.837 --> 32:57.805
Or who I'll be if I
can't be a doctor anymore.

32:58.841 --> 33:01.241
I do know

33:01.242 --> 33:03.067
whatever that version of me

33:03.068 --> 33:05.902
looks like, there's no
way Nic deserves that.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.281
No.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.070
No?

33:18.071 --> 33:20.521
No, you cannot let them win.

33:20.522 --> 33:22.379
Medicine is money,

33:22.380 --> 33:24.617
and money breeds jerks.

33:24.618 --> 33:26.442
But you...

33:26.443 --> 33:28.419
you got to knuckle up
and get your job back.

33:29.706 --> 33:32.949
Hey, if not for yourself,

33:32.950 --> 33:35.803
then do it for the patients
who are relying on you.

33:35.804 --> 33:37.328
Get mad.

33:37.329 --> 33:40.331
Go kick some Red Rock ass.

33:40.332 --> 33:42.884
'Cause we are the Zero-G Brothers,

33:42.885 --> 33:46.388
and nobody... and I mean nobody...

33:46.389 --> 33:48.223
can keep us down.

33:48.224 --> 33:51.009
All right?

33:51.010 --> 33:52.568
Zero-G Brothers?

33:54.155 --> 33:55.322
Yeah.

33:55.323 --> 33:59.067
- (CHUCKLES)
- For life.

33:59.068 --> 34:00.518
You know what?

34:00.519 --> 34:01.869
Guys like us...

34:03.832 --> 34:06.541
... find a way to beat the odds.

34:24.351 --> 34:25.710
Don't get too excited.

34:25.710 --> 34:27.688
She'll be off that vent shortly.

34:27.688 --> 34:29.172
So you'll have to find another patient

34:29.172 --> 34:31.024
to fill your open bed.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.791
What's an empty bed cost you...

34:32.792 --> 34:35.103
another overpriced painting?

34:35.103 --> 34:37.387
I remind you that I am the chief.

34:37.388 --> 34:40.080
And with your stats, you're expendable.

34:40.081 --> 34:41.971
Well, I'd like to
remind you of something

34:41.972 --> 34:43.393
you've apparently forgotten.

34:43.395 --> 34:47.524
The sacred contract between
a surgeon and a patient.

34:47.525 --> 34:50.952
That which distinguishes us
from all other physicians.

34:50.953 --> 34:53.862
We cut people open.

34:53.864 --> 34:55.842
We inflict wounds to make them better.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.701
They trust us with their lives.

34:58.702 --> 35:00.703
And I don't cut for the sake of cutting.

35:00.704 --> 35:03.724
I don't do it for the
prestige or the cash

35:03.725 --> 35:06.209
or the stats or the RVUs.

35:06.210 --> 35:08.637
I do it for the patients.

35:08.638 --> 35:11.306
I do it for people like her.

35:11.307 --> 35:13.975
You must have been different once.

35:13.976 --> 35:16.812
What happened to you, Barrett?

35:16.813 --> 35:19.071
I was born the man I am
today, and I'm proud of it.

35:21.433 --> 35:24.578
No. No, I... I think you're lying.

35:24.579 --> 35:26.343
You encouraged this woman to sign a DNR

35:26.344 --> 35:28.086
when I explicitly told you not to.

35:28.607 --> 35:30.083
You will not disobey me again.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.850
Or what?

35:31.851 --> 35:33.714
You'll have me fired, like Hawkins?

35:33.715 --> 35:35.497
Demoted, like Bell?

35:35.498 --> 35:38.425
What's the endgame, Barrett?

35:38.426 --> 35:40.238
You cut all your adversaries,

35:40.239 --> 35:41.792
surround yourself with bootlickers

35:41.793 --> 35:43.570
and those who toe the line.

35:43.571 --> 35:45.312
Yeah, it'll work for a hot minute,

35:45.313 --> 35:48.084
but I guarantee you it
will breed resentment,

35:48.085 --> 35:49.678
corruption.

35:49.679 --> 35:53.440
And eventually Chastain will implode,

35:53.441 --> 35:55.441
and you right along with it.

36:06.835 --> 36:09.419
I told him going to
the ER was a crazy idea.

36:09.420 --> 36:10.913
It's a good thing he didn't listen.

36:10.914 --> 36:12.704
It's just lucky it
happened here at Chastain,

36:12.705 --> 36:15.295
where we have a
world-class cardiac team.

36:15.296 --> 36:16.936
ODEL: That is lucky.

36:16.937 --> 36:18.987
- (COUGHS)
- Honey...

36:18.988 --> 36:21.488
Did the bronchoscopy explain
why I have this damn cough?

36:24.288 --> 36:26.139
Postnasal drip.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.094
Which is what I saw when I
first examined you in the ER.

36:29.095 --> 36:30.886
But we needed the test to confirm that.

36:30.887 --> 36:32.980
Did we?

36:32.981 --> 36:35.505
DEVON: Antihistamines are
the first line of treatment.

36:35.506 --> 36:36.834
If it's still bothering you, I'd say

36:36.835 --> 36:38.318
talk to your primary care doctor.

36:38.319 --> 36:40.303
but there's nothing to worry about.

36:40.304 --> 36:42.472
- See?
- That's good news.

36:42.473 --> 36:45.015
ODEL: Thank you...

36:45.016 --> 36:46.915
for the great care.

36:46.916 --> 36:48.183
Our pleasure.

36:52.223 --> 36:54.030
<i>ELINE: Why didn't you say anything?</i>

36:54.031 --> 36:55.997
He wasn't lucky to have
a heart attack here.

36:55.998 --> 36:57.029
I gave it to him.

36:57.030 --> 36:59.163
It is also my instinct to be truthful,

36:59.164 --> 37:01.439
and I am, most of the time.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.706
- So why not now?
- Because if we tell the truth,

37:03.707 --> 37:04.941
you'll be fired for whistleblowing,

37:04.942 --> 37:06.696
and another conscientious
doctor will no longer

37:06.697 --> 37:08.620
- be helping patients.
- (SIGHS)

37:08.621 --> 37:10.071
The lesson to learn is

37:10.072 --> 37:11.854
the best and hardest thing in medicine

37:11.855 --> 37:14.459
is often to do nothing.

37:14.460 --> 37:16.553
We care for our patients
knowing full well

37:16.554 --> 37:17.963
this is also a business.

37:17.964 --> 37:20.131
The trick is not to get
caught between the two.

37:20.132 --> 37:22.467
My first day was also a disaster.

37:22.468 --> 37:24.584
And by the end of it, I
was questioning whether...

37:24.585 --> 37:26.566
I worked way too hard to get here.

37:26.567 --> 37:28.715
I have no intention of quitting.

37:28.716 --> 37:30.901
Good.

37:30.902 --> 37:33.543
No one died, no one quit.

37:33.544 --> 37:34.544
My job here is done.

37:36.022 --> 37:38.346
Oh, and you're not the only one to blame

37:38.347 --> 37:39.985

38:36.300 --> 38:38.951
Mm, practicing medicine is hard,

38:38.952 --> 38:41.379
but teaching it is a whole other beast.

38:41.380 --> 38:43.164
That's the truth.

There's something else. I
need to schedule some lab work.

- Me.

I've just got some pain under my ribs.

Stomach ache, and this rash.

You're a rule breaker.

42:33.602 --> 42:36.960
I've decided I'm not gonna
let them win so easily.

42:36.961 --> 42:38.790
Son, I've gone toe-to-toe

42:38.791 --> 42:41.367
with a lot of titans in my time.

42:41.368 --> 42:44.037
These Red Rock people...

42:44.038 --> 42:45.486
you're gonna have to bring

42:45.487 --> 42:47.799
more than a slingshot to this fight.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.634
<i>It's gonna get ugly.</i>

42:49.635 --> 42:51.427
<i>For all of us.</i>

42:52.805 --> 42:54.214
<i>I just want to make sure you know</i>

42:54.215 --> 42:56.141
<i>what we're up against.</i>

42:56.142 --> 42:58.960
I hear you, Dad. Thank you.

42:58.961 --> 43:00.628
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:00.629 --> 43:02.672
Missed you today.

43:02.673 --> 43:04.173
I missed you, too.

43:04.174 --> 43:05.675
It was a good day?

43:05.676 --> 43:08.344
Zero-g with Finn is just what I needed.

43:08.345 --> 43:10.905
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

43:11.827 --> 43:13.151
Red Rock came for me.

43:13.152 --> 43:14.651
Now I'm coming for them.

43:15.305 --> 43:21.573
