[Brian] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:02.041 --> 00:05.208
So this sleeping
in separate rooms,
how long has this been going on?

00:05.208 --> 00:07.375
We really didn't think
it was gonna...

00:07.375 --> 00:08.834
- Last that long.
- Yeah.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.667
What's our problem? There's
something missing for you.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.500
The problem is
you cannot forgive me!

00:14.500 --> 00:18.500
I mean, I truly love this woman.

00:18.500 --> 00:23.000
We're getting married
in four days in front
of 200 people, God and everyone.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.834
- What about Brian?
- The wedding's October 16th.
October 17th I'll go home.

00:26.834 --> 00:28.625
Oh, my God. Hi!

00:28.625 --> 00:30.625
Oh, they're gonna scream at you.

00:30.625 --> 00:34.875
- I know about you and Marjorie.
- It was a mistake.
Those feelings are gone.

00:34.875 --> 00:37.709
I came back because
I wanna make things right.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.166
What's going on?

00:40.166 --> 00:43.291
You've been talking
about second chances.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.250
What?

01:10.250 --> 01:14.458
What? Tell me.

01:14.458 --> 01:17.667
- Nothing, nothing.
- No, you were going
to say something.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.208
It's just...

01:25.250 --> 01:28.625
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do this.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.041
[dance music playing]

01:31.041 --> 01:33.709
I mean, it's
a complete disaster, Brian.

01:33.709 --> 01:36.917
[laughing] Why'd you bring her
if she has a big head?

01:36.917 --> 01:38.792
I didn't know
she had a big head.

01:38.792 --> 01:41.250
Her head is huge.
It's the first thing you notice.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.709
She was sitting down.
I thought she was tall.

01:43.709 --> 01:46.959
- Then her head
would be in proportion.
- That makes no sense.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.959
That's what I thought.
I asked her out.

01:48.959 --> 01:51.041
When she stood up,
she was really short

01:51.041 --> 01:53.417
with this abnormally large head.

01:53.417 --> 01:56.792
- She's Mr. Potato Head.
- Yup, Mr. Potato Head.

01:56.792 --> 01:59.417
Thank God you're here.
This is the worst night.

01:59.417 --> 02:03.250
I hate New Year's Eve.
All this expectation,
this pressure to have fun.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.291
And same with Halloween.
I mean, what's fun about that?

02:12.834 --> 02:15.917
Hey, Jimmy. Wow. Who is she?

02:15.917 --> 02:18.667
- I don't know,
I'm gonna talk to her.
- What about me?

02:18.667 --> 02:21.792
- Can't leave me
with Mr. Potato Head.
- Sure, I can.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.166
Do I have to kiss her?

02:23.166 --> 02:25.875
- It is New Year's.
- But she has really small lips.

02:25.875 --> 02:29.709
Maybe you switch 'em
for bigger ones, like
the real Mr. Potato Head.

02:29.709 --> 02:31.458
That's really hilarious!

02:31.458 --> 02:34.500
I can't do this.
I can't. We can't.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.000
I mean, you're getting
married tomorrow.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.291
I can't do this. Not to Adam.

02:43.667 --> 02:47.375
He's my best friend.
I've known him since
third grade. Little League.

02:47.375 --> 02:51.667
- Summer camp.
- I never should've come.

02:51.667 --> 02:54.333
- No, Marjorie, wait a second.
- No, I have to go.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.458
I'm so sorry, Brian. I'm sorry.

03:04.208 --> 03:07.083
[Deena] I have so much
to clean up before the wedding.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.208
- You know what?
- What?

03:09.208 --> 03:11.208
- I had an idea.
- Yeah?

03:11.208 --> 03:16.333
Yeah, I was thinking
maybe we could go downstairs
and... play some cards.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.000
- Cards?
- Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
- Honey, are you serious?
- Yeah!

03:21.000 --> 03:23.542
You know, play a little gin
rummy like we used to do.

03:23.542 --> 03:27.834
Honey, I have got all
of this stuff to clean up,

03:27.834 --> 03:30.792
and I've still gotta get
ready for the wedding.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.875
And let's face it, it doesn't
take five minutes anymore.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.375
You know what I mean?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.166
Yeah.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.041
- What?
- Thought it would
be good for us.

03:46.041 --> 03:49.375
We never get a chance to just be
together and chill, you and me.

03:49.375 --> 03:52.500
We have three kids, honey.
Nobody chills with three kids.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.959
It's not about the girls, Deena.
All right, I'm trying, hon.

03:56.959 --> 04:00.208
I'm trying.
You gotta meet me halfway.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.375
OK, you know what, I'll...

04:04.375 --> 04:07.375
Give me a few minutes.
I'll get all this taken care of.

04:07.375 --> 04:11.333
I'll make up my bed with
the girls, and then I...

04:11.333 --> 04:13.333
I should stay
with the girls tonight,

04:13.333 --> 04:14.792
in case they were scared.

04:14.792 --> 04:18.792
Look, I know the storage room
isn't exactly the Four Seasons.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.166
It's barely one season,
but you know,

04:21.166 --> 04:25.208
I was thinking that maybe
you and I could fit in
there together if we tried.

04:25.208 --> 04:29.792

first apartment, only bigger.

You should be with the girls,
they're gonna be afraid.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.583
Sorry. I was in the bathroom.
My hands are... wet.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.375
From washing my hands.
No paper towels.

13:19.375 --> 13:22.417
Don't worry about it. I'm
glad that you wash your hands.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.834
Not enough people do.
That's how you get sick.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.875
- You sound like a doctor.
- I am.

13:26.875 --> 13:30.250
- Well, going to be.
- Wow. Impressive.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.750
This may sound really weird,

13:33.750 --> 13:38.709
and I'm pretty sure I've
never said this before, but...

13:38.709 --> 13:43.166
- ...your dress
is really amazing.
- Thank you.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.417
The invitation
said "festive attire."

13:45.417 --> 13:47.834
- I never know what that means.
- What is that?

13:47.834 --> 13:50.500
It makes me think
I'm supposed to wear a sombrero.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.333
- You have a sombrero?
- I do, in fact.
I have a sombrero.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.333
- Really?
- I love Mexican food.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.792
I'm kind of an aficionado.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.792
I like to wear
the appropriate gear.

13:58.792 --> 14:01.000
I happen to know
the best place in town

14:01.000 --> 14:02.500
where you can get taquitos.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.291
No, you don't. I do. I'm sorry.

14:04.291 --> 14:07.500
- Loteria, Farmers Market.
- Loteria, Farmers Market.

14:09.667 --> 14:10.959
OK.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.542
Well, um...

14:19.000 --> 14:21.917
...maybe I'll see you
there sometime.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.166
Yeah. Maybe.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.333
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.458
[knocking]

14:47.417 --> 14:49.291
What do you want?

14:58.208 --> 15:00.667
- [Suzanne] You're so dead.
- Bring it, bring it.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.792
No, no! Oh, you little creep!

15:02.792 --> 15:04.458
There you go.

15:04.458 --> 15:09.083
In all fairness, I do have you
by several hundred hours.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.542
- Dave?
- Yeah.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.166
- It's incredible.
- Incredible enough to market?

15:14.166 --> 15:15.875
Listen, Dave,
my bosses at Leviathan

15:15.875 --> 15:18.208
are gonna love it
just as much as I do.

15:18.208 --> 15:21.291
We've been looking to publish
a game like this for years.

15:21.291 --> 15:23.792
Yours is the third one
we've tried to develop.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.000
Yeah.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.959
You know, this is all
kinda bittersweet for me.

15:30.959 --> 15:32.917
- What is?
- This ending.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.500
Once we approve the game,

15:34.500 --> 15:37.625
it goes off to the marketing
people, and I'm just...

15:37.625 --> 15:42.250
I'm just gonna miss
seeing you, you know?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.417
I'm gonna miss this.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.667
I'm sure we'll
work together again.

15:45.667 --> 15:50.000
I mean, you publish
video games and...

15:50.000 --> 15:52.417
...we are video game makers.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.917
It's like
a match made in heaven.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.291
I think so too.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.625
Do you ever think
about that night?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.083
Yeah.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.667
I know we said
it could only happen one time,

16:15.667 --> 16:18.166
- but I really wish we could...
- Me too.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.875
I think you're amazing.

16:22.125 --> 16:25.083
- Thank you.
- But you know that, right?

16:26.792 --> 16:30.125
- Not really.
- I think about you
all the time.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.834
What are you doing here?

16:53.834 --> 16:56.667
Nothing. I came by to see
if you guys needed anything.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.000
Hey, Adam? I found
your cuff link.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.333
What's going on, Brian?
What are you doing here?

17:07.333 --> 17:10.375
Yeah, Brian,
what are you doing here?

17:10.375 --> 17:13.166
- I just told you...
- You came here to see Marjorie?

17:13.166 --> 17:15.834
And you didn't think
I would be here.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.667
[dance music playing]

17:24.208 --> 17:26.500
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.041
Pardon me.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.875
Excuse me.

17:52.709 --> 17:56.291
Brian? Brian!
What do you have to say, Brian?

17:58.417 --> 18:00.917
- I'm just gonna go.
- Why did you come up here?

18:00.917 --> 18:03.166
I told you, I was
just trying to see...

18:03.166 --> 18:06.041
- You should just leave, OK?
- Please don't touch him.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.583
- Adam, stop, please?
- Come on. Be a man, Brian.

18:08.583 --> 18:12.208
- Say what you
came up here to say.
- What'd you say?

18:12.208 --> 18:14.875
Two choices. You can
run away like you always do,

18:14.875 --> 18:17.375
or you can tell me
why the hell you are here.

18:20.917 --> 18:23.375
Yeah, that's what I thought.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.709
You guys shouldn't get married.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.250
God, Adam! Stop it!

18:33.667 --> 18:35.250
Brian, you need to leave.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.208
Get out.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.959
Is this what you want?

18:41.959 --> 18:44.417
Get the hell outta my house!

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I don't think anything's broken.

19:16.709 --> 19:19.000
I'm gonna get you
some ibuprofen.

19:22.709 --> 19:24.250
Are you OK?

19:26.792 --> 19:28.000
Yeah.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.291
- Are we OK?
- Yeah.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.250
I wanna erase everything.

19:42.250 --> 19:46.083
I wanna restart
this whole day right now.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.000
We're getting married today.

19:56.125 --> 19:59.166
Yes. We are.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.917
This is the beginning.

20:02.709 --> 20:05.875
- Right now.
- This moment.

20:07.333 --> 20:11.041
[♪ Love Is a Golden Ring]

20:11.041 --> 20:14.875
♪ Your love and mine, dear
It will shine, dear ♪

20:14.875 --> 20:18.875
♪ Just like that golden ring
on your finger ♪

20:18.875 --> 20:21.709
[Deena] I looked so silly
on my wedding day.

20:21.709 --> 20:25.083
I put all those little braids
in my hair and those flowers.

20:25.083 --> 20:26.625
I don't know
what I was thinking.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.542
You looked sweet,
like a little hippie bride.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.834
How old were you, anyway, 16?

20:31.834 --> 20:34.500
Twenty. Dave looked so handsome.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.542
He was wearing a little suit.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.291
And I'd never seen him
in a suit before.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.709
And I kept thinking about
I wanted to jump him

20:40.709 --> 20:44.375
in front of all those people
and God and you know.

20:44.375 --> 20:48.709
I felt the same way about
Angelo. Don't ask me why.

20:48.709 --> 20:50.166
You need to call him.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.041
Does your veil
have a comb or tiara?

20:53.041 --> 20:55.500
- I don't have a veil.
- What? You loved your veil.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.792
- Where is it?
- Yeah, it was gorgeous.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.625
They got backed up at the shop.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.583
Everybody wanted the ivory
headpiece with crystals.

21:02.583 --> 21:04.542
But you have to have a veil!

21:04.542 --> 21:07.250
So much to take care of,
I couldn't fight with her.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.166
You can't, but I can.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.458
I will get you that veil if I
have to strangle that seamstress

21:12.458 --> 21:16.208
with my freshly manicured hands.
I'll just pretend it's Angelo.

21:16.208 --> 21:19.583
I don't know why you didn't
just get pre-tied bow ties.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.750
- They make life easier.
- I'm not wearing a clip-on tie.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.875
- Do I look like a dork?
- It's what I wore.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.041
- You looked like a dork.
- I looked good.

21:27.041 --> 21:30.750
Deena talks about it
all the time. We wound up
doing it in the bathroom.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.333
- Nice.
- Yeah.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.041
Let me try this again.

21:34.041 --> 21:36.792
A little bit of quiet,
so I can concentrate.

21:44.125 --> 21:46.834
I never realized you had
a fleck in your right eye.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.375
You have nice eyes, Dave.

21:51.375 --> 21:55.083
Yeah. Are you gonna
sweet talk me all day,
or are you gonna kiss me?

21:57.875 --> 22:00.041
Speaking of kissing,

22:00.041 --> 22:04.250
how did last night go
with Summer?

22:06.083 --> 22:08.667
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Her name was Summer.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.250
I dated an Autumn once
and I haven't recovered.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.625
Yeah, nothing happened.

22:12.625 --> 22:15.291
I'm sure something
could've, but nothing did.

22:15.291 --> 22:19.125
That surprises me.
She was all over you.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.959
Well, the more
I thought about it,

22:20.959 --> 22:23.000
the more it
didn't make any sense.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.250
I could have slept with her
and no one would have known,
but I would know.

22:27.250 --> 22:30.709
Marjorie told me to have
a good time, and she
said, "I trust you."

22:30.709 --> 22:33.417
That's all I kept hearing
when I was with Summer,

22:33.417 --> 22:36.333
Marjorie saying she trusted me.

22:36.333 --> 22:39.125
Hm, trust.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.333
That's what
it's all about, right?

22:44.625 --> 22:46.500
That's what it's all about.

22:48.959 --> 22:51.917
[Deena] Are you OK, honey?
You haven't really said much.

22:53.291 --> 22:55.208
Has something happened?

22:58.583 --> 23:00.458
I went to see Brian last night.

23:01.917 --> 23:05.917
- No, you did not.
- I did.

23:05.917 --> 23:09.166
I did. I mean, nothing happen...
something happened,

23:09.166 --> 23:10.542
but really nothing.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.875
I wanted it to.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.709
Wait, what are you saying?

23:18.709 --> 23:22.208
You don't wanna
get married today?

23:22.208 --> 23:24.625
I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm confused.

23:24.625 --> 23:25.959
OK.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.000
Breathe.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.208
Now, just... just talk to me.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.542
I felt like I was gonna drown if
I didn't take that last chance

23:39.542 --> 23:40.875
to be with Brian, you know,

23:40.875 --> 23:43.375
and then I was relieved
when he stopped it.

23:43.375 --> 23:46.959
And then... And then there's
this other part of me

23:46.959 --> 23:48.917
that felt horrible, you know,

23:48.917 --> 23:50.709
because I wished
that he wouldn't.

23:50.709 --> 23:53.083
OK, don't. Whoa.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.500
Do not do that to yourself.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.250
- You said nothing happened.
- I know. I know.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.583
I love Adam. I love him.

24:07.291 --> 24:11.041
I'm just so scared
of everything, you know.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.250
What if I don't
love him in seven years?

24:14.250 --> 24:17.083
What if we fail, what if
I'm still thinking of Brian?

24:17.083 --> 24:19.917
Maybe you will
still think about Brian.

24:19.917 --> 24:23.041
Maybe it'll be somebody else.

24:23.041 --> 24:25.542
That's just life, you know?

24:25.542 --> 24:28.000
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't marry Adam.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.750
How do you know that?

24:32.333 --> 24:33.959
Because you do.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.625
Getting married
is just taking a leap.

24:39.625 --> 24:43.333
A huge leap into the unknown.

24:43.333 --> 24:47.792
You know, believing in yourself
and Adam and the human race.

24:49.208 --> 24:52.458
If you're asking if I think
you should walk down that aisle,

24:52.458 --> 24:55.542
I'd say yes. Yes, you should.

24:56.709 --> 25:01.000
You'll never regret it.
I never have.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.166
I never will, no matter what
happens with me and Dave.

25:09.458 --> 25:10.792
OK.

25:12.542 --> 25:15.333
Hey, Bri, I'm here
to pick you up.

25:15.333 --> 25:18.875
I know I'm early, but we have
to make a stop on the way.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.792
I need to talk to a seamstress.

25:21.792 --> 25:26.125
Whatever. Anyway, we can't be
late, so let's go. Hurry, hurry.

25:26.125 --> 25:29.500
When you get your own car,
you can be on your own schedule.

25:31.834 --> 25:35.000
- Did you get
in a fight with the TV?
- Kicked it.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.125
You couldn't find
anything to watch?

25:37.125 --> 25:40.291
- I got in a fight with Adam.
- What happened?

25:41.542 --> 25:43.709
I don't even know
where to start.

25:50.041 --> 25:52.959
I'm in love with Marjorie.
It's as simple as that.

25:55.667 --> 25:56.792
Oh, Brian.

26:00.542 --> 26:04.208
- She came over last night.
- Oh, my God.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.208
- What happened?
- Nothing.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.000
I told her to leave.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.917
Exactly. Nothing.

26:22.917 --> 26:25.250
Because that's who you are.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.834
Do you know that this is your
entire relationship with Adam?

26:30.667 --> 26:33.500
- You always have
to be the nice guy.
- That is not true.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.250
Yes, it is.

26:35.250 --> 26:37.250
You don't wanna hurt anyone,

26:37.250 --> 26:40.375
so you don't act
until it's too late

26:40.375 --> 26:42.625
because that's what you do.

26:45.125 --> 26:47.250
You know, I have to go.

26:54.583 --> 26:56.417
Oh, there you are. Thank God.

26:56.417 --> 26:58.750
I was gonna look for you.
I'm cutting out.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.291
- You can't.
- I'm going.

27:00.291 --> 27:03.917
Please, I need a favor. I
actually need you to take Lucy.

27:03.917 --> 27:07.417
- I kinda got
something else going on.
- Who's Lucy?

27:07.417 --> 27:09.792
- Mr. Potato Head?
- Oh, come on, that's not fair.

27:09.792 --> 27:12.917
She's actually a lovely person
who needs a ride home.

27:12.917 --> 27:15.333
- Mr. Potato Head?
- Don't make me beg.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.125
Come on, don't we always
have each other's backs?

27:18.125 --> 27:21.792
Sorry. Look, no, I've been
drinking, I can't drive.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.750
Done. Cab fare.
For the both of you.

27:23.750 --> 27:26.291
Keep the rest
and get drunk. I owe you.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.083
- Jason, right?
- No. It's Philip.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.333
- I need to borrow your car.
- Do I know you?

27:56.333 --> 27:58.500
