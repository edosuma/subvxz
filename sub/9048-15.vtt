Lots of girls
think you're cute.

19:42.270 --> 19:43.536
Tamara just said so today.

19:43.538 --> 19:49.509
- Thanks, you know,
but I'll see you around, okay?

19:49.511 --> 19:51.177
- Owen might be hurting,

19:51.179 --> 19:55.715
but I knew I'd finally done
the right thing.

19:55.717 --> 19:57.517
My moral compass
was pointing north,

19:57.519 --> 20:00.320
and it turns out,
Matty McKibben was actually

20:00.322 --> 20:03.189
a pretty great friend.

20:05.593 --> 20:07.761
[Computer chiming]

20:16.270 --> 20:18.238
I may have closed the lid
on the Matty drama,

20:18.240 --> 20:23.943
but I'd opened a Pandora's Box
of hashtag hating.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.946
The dude database
was going viral,

20:26.948 --> 20:29.449
and the balance of power
had definitely shifted

20:29.451 --> 20:30.417
from the guys to the girls.

20:30.419 --> 20:34.421
And if anyone found out
I was partly responsible,

20:34.423 --> 20:36.456
I'd be #toast.

20:38.259 --> 20:39.859
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>
- If you ever tell anyone this,

20:39.861 --> 20:41.361
I will gouge out your eyes
with my thumbs.

20:41.363 --> 20:46.332
- The dude database
has gone full-on viral.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.768
Did Owen just kiss your cheek?
- What? No.

20:48.770 --> 20:52.572
- Game is the operative word
here, player.

20:52.574 --> 20:53.506
- W--

20:53.508 --> 20:54.841
- when I don't answer my phone,

20:54.843 --> 20:57.544
it's 'cause I don't want
to talk to you.
