00:15.281 --> 00:17.884
- I know that you
not being the agent

00:17.917 --> 00:20.887
when I bought this house
was a huge point of contention.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.157
<i>But working with your
sister is a major choice.</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:27.426
I will give you your 29.9,
but you need to deliver.

00:27.827 --> 00:28.894
<i>- My client loved the house,</i>

00:28.928 --> 00:30.496
and I think I got a great offer.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.498
24 million.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.466
- The offer that you are
bringing me right now

00:33.500 --> 00:35.902
I won't even
present to my client,

00:35.935 --> 00:37.270
sister or not.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.240

00:41.274 --> 00:42.609

00:42.642 --> 00:44.344
<i>so we're gonna go
there and save the day.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.279
$8 1/2 million.
That's what I think.

00:46.311 --> 00:48.479
- You'll get us the best.
- We'll get you the best.

00:48.810 --> 00:49.615
- Okay.
- And we'll have fun doing it.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.551
- And most important, I
want the person who gets this

00:51.584 --> 00:53.253
to really get
what this house is.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.454
- No, the most important is,

00:54.487 --> 00:55.655
they pay the most
amount of money.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.158
- I was gonna actually start
the search in Palm Springs,

00:58.191 --> 01:00.627
for a house. I think
I'm emotionally ready

01:00.659 --> 01:04.164

gonna buy for my parents.</i>

01:05.980 --> 01:07.500
- I'm trying to figure out how
do you create value here?

01:07.534 --> 01:09.101
- I can build a casita out here.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.337
You want to see
where I'd put it?

01:10.370 --> 01:11.570
- No. Where can you add

01:11.603 --> 01:13.706
a third bedroom
in the structure,

01:13.739 --> 01:15.542
to maximize and get
more square footage?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.545
- I'm asking for your
opinion, as my husband.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.579
- My only concern is, how
do you create value here?

01:20.612 --> 01:22.113
- Forget it, Josh. Forget it.

01:22.114 --> 01:23.316
I can't do this with you.

01:23.349 --> 01:24.817
How is that being
supportive? It's not.

01:24.850 --> 01:26.519

01:34.993 --> 01:36.429

01:36.462 --> 01:37.963
- Yeah. It's what stone's for.

01:37.996 --> 01:39.966
- Dude, treat my stone
like I would treat your stone.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.102
- You know, in the sprinter,
when you go to the bathroom,

01:42.134 --> 01:44.971
and you decide
to have me clean it.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.573
Okay? I think we're fair.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.175
- What?
- Your trip to the houses.

02:23.209 --> 02:26.846
- Not great. I just
saw one last one.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.818
Had a main house,
like, a second house.

02:29.819 --> 02:30.383
- Mm-hmm.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.848
- And then a cute
little guest house.

02:32.849 --> 02:33.385
- Oh. What was wrong with it?

02:33.420 --> 02:34.521
- Right next to a hospital.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.754
- That's almost
as bad as a school.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.956
Actually, it's worse
than a school.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.692
Bobby and I are in Palm Springs,

02:39.725 --> 02:41.360
working on Suzanne
Somers' property.

02:41.394 --> 02:43.163

02:45.979 --> 02:46.633

little tense yesterday

02:46.665 --> 02:48.501
when we went to
go see Santa Elena,

02:48.534 --> 02:52.271
so I thought we needed a
little space and time to cool off.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.105
- So are you upset with me

02:54.106 --> 02:55.709
'cause I said that you weren't
supportive at the house?

02:55.741 --> 02:57.099
- No. Not at all.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.677
- Really?
- No.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.580
- Well, I mean, I
think you're right.

03:00.612 --> 03:02.479
It's overpriced.

03:02.819 --> 03:03.682
It's probably not
the right time.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.552
I think I'm a little
overemotional with it,

03:06.586 --> 03:08.587
and I don't want to
make the wrong decision.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.560
- Yeah. Emotions
and real estate...

03:10.900 --> 03:11.457
- So...
- Are horrible.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.658
- I think you're right.
We should wait.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.659
- Okay.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.260
- If I was coming down
from all the emotions,

03:15.294 --> 03:16.628
just when I was there,

03:16.663 --> 03:19.632
I was imagining what
I imagined years ago.

03:19.665 --> 03:21.867
- Well, you can still have that,

03:21.901 --> 03:23.569
just not for $3.4 million.

03:23.603 --> 03:26.506
- I recognize that now, because
I have you as my husband...

03:26.538 --> 03:28.207
- Aw.
- To tell me that.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.210
- Well.
- To bring me down to Earth.

03:30.242 --> 03:31.770
- Maybe you'll
just get that house.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.444
You never know.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.280
In six months, it'll
probably still be there.

03:34.313 --> 03:35.615
- Well, it's meant to be.

03:35.647 --> 03:37.751
- And what's meant
to be is meant to be.

03:37.783 --> 03:39.252
- I just thought that
buying the house

03:39.284 --> 03:42.288

04:41.715 --> 04:43.828

Leetal, who's their agent.

04:49.588 --> 04:50.856

04:54.939 --> 04:55.562

04:55.595 --> 04:57.297

she had it at 10 million.

04:57.329 --> 04:58.398
- Got it. Okay.

04:58.430 --> 04:59.733

Oh, my God. Do I look too brown?

<i>- What was the vision?

06:43.689 --> 06:44.269

06:44.303 --> 06:46.406
<i>A white kitchen

06:46.439 --> 06:48.408
<i>Hidden pantry.
- Oh, wow.</i>

06:48.441 --> 06:50.409
- All the carpentry--
It's Pedini LA.

06:50.442 --> 06:52.778
- It sounded
Italian, before you--

06:52.779 --> 06:53.789
- Italian.

06:53.790 --> 06:55.281
- Before you said
LA, it sounded Italian.

06:55.314 --> 06:57.783
- Why is the house empty,
if you don't mind me asking?

06:57.817 --> 07:00.198
- We've been on the market,
as you know, for 10 million,

07:00.199 --> 07:01.620
for a few months.

07:01.653 --> 07:04.290
And we never really were
happy with the staging.

07:04.324 --> 07:05.692
I mean, was it kind of weak?

07:05.725 --> 07:08.278
So we think we want
to do a new staging,

07:08.279 --> 07:10.829
bring a new broker in,
maybe adjust the price, and...

07:10.863 --> 07:12.432
- Got it.
- Start over.

07:13.899 --> 07:15.869
<i>- We have a concrete
finish-looking wall here.</i>

07:15.901 --> 07:16.702
- Wow.

07:16.735 --> 07:18.538
- Hidden cabinets
for extra storage.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.673
- Beautiful.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.240
- This beautiful, detailed wood.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.742
All hand-finished,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.276
and it also continues all
the way to the top floor.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.680
- Gorgeous.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.648
<i>- Oh, God. Look at this.</i>

07:28.682 --> 07:31.817
I love that you carried
the wood louvers upstairs,

07:31.850 --> 07:33.452
<i>and you've done
these bookshelves.</i>

07:33.485 --> 07:35.549
<i>- Yes.
- This is just fabulous.</i>

07:35.550 --> 07:37.568
You know, building
this, did you have a vision

07:37.569 --> 07:40.159
of, like, who you were
building the house for?

07:40.192 --> 07:41.494
Where was your mindset?

07:41.528 --> 07:44.230
- First thing I was
thinking is a rock star.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.598
- A rock star is good.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.834
- But a family can
enjoy this house as well.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.729
- This view!

07:53.730 --> 07:57.209
<i>This house could work
perfectly for a bachelor</i>

07:57.242 --> 07:58.711
as well as a family.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.713
- Take a look at
this. A lot of details...

08:00.747 --> 08:01.714
<i>- Fabulous.
- On the wall.</i>

08:01.747 --> 08:03.350
<i>Everything was handcrafted.</i>

08:03.382 --> 08:05.351
<i>- A bachelor would love it</i>

08:05.384 --> 08:07.187
<i>because you're close to
Sunset and Beverly Hills,</i>

08:07.220 --> 08:08.721
<i>but a family could also love it</i>

08:08.754 --> 08:11.358
<i>because you're
tucked away quietly.</i>

08:11.391 --> 08:13.726
It's private and
serene, and it has

08:13.759 --> 08:15.862
that "family feeling"
neighborhood vibe to it.

08:15.894 --> 08:17.831
- This looks like wallpaper.

08:17.863 --> 08:20.266
It's actually all custom
handmade by an artist.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.800
Took four days and very,

08:21.834 --> 08:23.769
very precise stages
to create this look.

08:23.802 --> 08:25.204
- Oh, my God.
- And I mean--

08:25.237 --> 08:26.872
- What is this material?
I've never seen this.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.107
- It's a special
plaster. Italian.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.144
- He loves his Italian
finishes. I love that.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.679
- Make a big difference.
- The artist is Italian.

08:33.712 --> 08:34.947
Fabio.
- Fabio his name.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.820
- Really?
- Is his name Fabio?

08:36.115 --> 08:37.499
- Yeah. Fabio.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.952
- Oh, Fabio. Fabio.
The designer Fabio.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.590
- From Italy. No ----ing idea.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.158
Fabio actually did this?
- Yeah.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.326
- It's beautiful.
It's really beautiful.

08:48.940 --> 08:49.796
- Are you guys ready
for the roof deck?

08:49.828 --> 08:51.663
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.734
<i>- Oh, my goodness.
- 360-degree views.</i>

08:54.768 --> 08:56.201
<i>- Spectacular.</i>

08:56.235 --> 08:58.303
<i>- Unobstructed and
completely private.</i>

08:58.337 --> 09:00.206
- So you said you bought
this three years ago?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.573
- Three years ago.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.243
- Do you remember
what you paid for the lot?

09:03.275 --> 09:04.410
- 1.9.

09:04.443 --> 09:05.577
- And what have you put into it?

09:05.611 --> 09:09.148
- Another $4 1/2 million,
so about $6 1/2 million total.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.784
- From what I can see,
you haven't cheaped out

09:11.817 --> 09:13.820
on anything.
It's just beautiful.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.822
<i>If we are going
to get this listing,</i>

09:16.855 --> 09:20.259
it's gonna be very
important to remarket

09:20.600 --> 09:22.629
<i>and rebrand the
property correctly,</i>

09:22.662 --> 09:24.931
but more important than anything

09:25.309 --> 09:26.700
is getting the price right.

09:26.932 --> 09:29.936
- We obviously love you two
as a team, and we just want

09:30.360 --> 09:31.937
to hear what you guys
think about the price.

09:32.379 --> 09:36.308
- This is a very hard
view to put a value on.

09:36.342 --> 09:40.447
And we think somewhere
between 1,000 to 1,200 a foot,

09:40.480 --> 09:44.616
you start coming up to that
$7 1/2 million price point,

09:44.650 --> 09:47.620
and beyond that, you
start losing buyers,

09:47.653 --> 09:49.456
you start accumulating
days on market,

09:49.489 --> 09:51.569
like you've already done.

09:51.570 --> 09:54.326
And I think 7 1/2 is probably
the number you guys

09:54.360 --> 09:57.864
want to realistically be
at, to get this house sold.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.798
- I'm a broker myself,
as well. I know the area.

09:59.832 --> 10:03.360
I know the house, and I
think that what the comps

10:03.690 --> 10:05.871
are showing, an 8
has to be in front of it.

10:05.904 --> 10:07.139
- And what are the
comps showing?

10:07.173 --> 10:08.841
- 1,250 a square foot.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.177
- We're talking a couple
of hundred thousand.

10:11.211 --> 10:16.282

7.995, I'd be blown away

10:16.316 --> 10:19.351

all around Beverly Hills.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.503
Are you looking with anybody?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.205
- I guess this is maybe, like,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.506
the first test you have
to go through with me.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.341
- Okay, so you
want to capitalize

16:49.375 --> 16:51.911
on the current market. Have
you thought about a price?

16:51.945 --> 16:55.462
- We've put about, all
in all, about 1/2 million in,

16:55.463 --> 16:57.584
in just this last year.
- Okay.

16:57.616 --> 17:00.452
- We were throwing nines around.

17:00.486 --> 17:03.490
- Okay. 9 is aggressive.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.326
Once you start
going in the 9 game,

17:06.358 --> 17:09.127
there's a lot of really good
houses to choose from,

17:09.128 --> 17:11.498
so I think it's important that
we stay a little under that.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.532
I'd rather you be the
best house in the eights

17:13.566 --> 17:15.669
than not the best
house in the nines.

17:15.701 --> 17:20.773
So 8.750, I can prove
that it's worth that,

17:20.807 --> 17:22.642

25:38.404 --> 25:40.729
and everything like that.

25:40.730 --> 25:41.508
I was such a big fan
of hers growing up.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.809
<i>- Some of the brokers
and buyers are here today</i>

25:43.843 --> 25:45.878
just because it's
Suzanne Somers' house.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.881
However, what's gonna
sell this property is the land

25:47.913 --> 25:49.214
and how unique this property is.

25:49.249 --> 25:53.286
And I want the brokers to leave
here thinking about that today.

25:54.753 --> 25:56.889
This is one of
my favorite rooms,

25:56.890 --> 25:58.324
over here. This is
the main dining room.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.560
<i>- Look at that view. Wow.
- Yeah.</i>

26:01.594 --> 26:04.698
- Isn't this fabulous?
This is original.

26:05.432 --> 26:07.267
This is a part of the original
house from the 1920s.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.903
- This is all authentic,
vintage charm.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.637
- Yeah, there's not a
lot of houses like this,

26:11.671 --> 26:13.239
in Palm Springs,
that are still here.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.773
Both: Right.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.678
- This is also added
to the property.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.579
- Recently added?
- 15 years ago.

26:20.613 --> 26:21.914
- Oh, that's recent...
- Yeah.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.717
- For Palm Springs.
- For Palm Springs. Yes.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.849
- That's brand new.
- It was recently added.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.421
- Yeah.
- So this is all suite.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.655
- Wow.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.657
- And then this was
all added by them.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.827
<i>This is Suzanne's bathroom.
- Wow.</i>

26:34.861 --> 26:36.429
And there's the ThighMaster
hanging on the door.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.332
- Please. The house
that ThighMaster built.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.134
<i>Although I've had many
things in between my thighs,</i>

26:41.166 --> 26:43.397
a ThighMaster is
not one of them.

26:43.398 --> 26:46.105
Come on this way. We
have Suzanne's closet.

26:47.374 --> 26:50.109
- Wow.
- You have Suzanne's office.

26:50.143 --> 26:52.778
And if you need a
book of Suzanne's...

26:52.779 --> 26:54.980
- Wow.
- There's 1,400 of them.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.250
So come on this way.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.586
We'll go see the little
stone house over here.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.921
<i>- This has got so many
nooks and crannies.</i>

27:02.220 --> 27:03.288
<i>- Isn't it fabulous?</i>

27:03.323 --> 27:04.824
<i>This is one of the latest houses</i>

27:04.857 --> 27:06.291
<i>that they've added
to the property.</i>

27:06.326 --> 27:08.728
This was done probably
about five or six years ago.

27:09.362 --> 27:10.696
<i>- Wow.
- It's nice, isn't it?</i>

27:10.730 --> 27:12.318
<i>- Beautiful.
- Yeah.</i>

27:12.319 --> 27:13.700
<i>- And then you come this
way, which is really pretty.</i>

27:13.732 --> 27:16.358
- Oh, wow.
- Love that door.

27:16.359 --> 27:17.936
- All these outdoor
dining areas.

27:18.380 --> 27:19.939
You've got 28 acres of land.
- I know.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.808
This is amazing. What's
that water I'm hearing?

27:22.842 --> 27:25.310
- That is water.
- Oh, okay.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.448
<i>- That is exactly what
it is. It is a waterfall.</i>

27:28.480 --> 27:30.316
<i>I'm really good friends
with Suzanne and Alan,</i>

27:30.349 --> 27:32.685
so I know this
property very, very well.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.153
Suzanne and Alan put that in.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.355
<i>It actually looks
like it's a spring,</i>

27:35.387 --> 27:37.490
<i>like it's been here for, a
hundred--you know, forever,</i>

27:37.523 --> 27:39.589
but it's not.
- Cool.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.760
<i>- It has a main house
and four individual villas,</i>

27:41.795 --> 27:44.931
a waterfall, a carousel,
an outdoor bathtub.

27:44.963 --> 27:47.366
I mean, you can do so
much on Suzanne's property.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.769
This is one of the
best parts. The bar.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.738
<i>Isn't this great? I
love this upstairs here.</i>

27:51.770 --> 27:53.839
<i>They say they put this in
about five or six years ago,</i>

27:53.873 --> 27:55.307
<i>but it just became,</i>

27:55.342 --> 27:56.509
<i>like, kind of the focal
point of the house.</i>

27:56.542 --> 27:57.711
- Yeah. No.
- It just works.

27:57.743 --> 27:58.845
- This is where you
want to hang out.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.146
<i>- Right?
- The area and the bath.</i>

28:01.181 --> 28:03.115
Do you know if
that's buildable at all?

28:03.148 --> 28:04.317
<i>I'm looking to possibly do</i>

28:04.351 --> 28:06.152
<i>something with
a vacation rental.</i>

28:06.185 --> 28:07.487
- That's something you're gonna
have to figure out on your own,

28:07.519 --> 28:09.489
or we could find
somebody--potentially somebody

28:09.521 --> 28:11.523
with the city that we could
answer those questions for you.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.589
- I do--

28:13.930 --> 28:14.193
- But I know you have
a lot of land here to do...

28:14.227 --> 28:15.795
- Yeah.
- A lot of things.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.196
- Right.
<i>- I'm not sure that Suzanne</i>

28:17.230 --> 28:19.561
would ever want this
to become an Airbnb,

28:19.562 --> 28:21.601
<i>and she prefers not
to sell to a developer.</i>

28:21.634 --> 28:24.203
But at the end of the
day, if you get 14 offers,

28:24.237 --> 28:26.705
and one happens to
be a developer, I get it.

28:26.740 --> 28:28.107
You don't take the
developer's offer.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.642
<i>But if you don't
have any other offers,</i>

28:29.675 --> 28:31.440
<i>and you don't have
things to choose from,</i>

28:31.769 --> 28:32.912
you take what you can get.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.180
<i>- Well, I don't think
there's another property</i>

28:34.213 --> 28:37.517
<i>in Palm Springs like this.</i>
- How do you think it's priced?

28:37.549 --> 28:38.852
- I think it's more than fair.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.420
- And it does
need a lot of work,

28:40.452 --> 28:41.855
depending on the person.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.390
And a lot of people
that are coming here

28:43.423 --> 28:45.224
right now--they want to
get out of where they are,

28:45.258 --> 28:46.425
and they want to get
into something now.

28:46.459 --> 28:47.826
So the idea of
taking on a project

28:47.861 --> 28:49.229
that might take several years

28:49.261 --> 28:50.730
to complete might not
be so appealing to them.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.131
- I don't know.

28:52.132 --> 28:53.866
I just feel like someone's
gonna move right in.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.101
I don't think anyone's
gonna touch anything.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.368
- You might be right. There's
nothing you have to do.

28:56.403 --> 28:57.671
But there's a lot
that you could.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.138
- The house probably needs

28:59.172 --> 29:01.410
who knows how many
hundreds of thousands,

29:01.740 --> 29:03.576
but somebody just
might like it the way it is.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.878
- We brought an offer when it
was for sale a few years ago.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.413
We were a little
far apart at the time.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.847
- Really?

29:08.882 --> 29:09.883
- So now that I've
seen it again, and--

29:09.915 --> 29:11.250
- Is he still around?

29:11.284 --> 29:12.919
- Oh, he's still around
and chomping at the bit,

29:13.190 --> 29:15.209
as always, so I might
see if I can get him back in.

29:15.210 --> 29:16.455
- And actually, Ricky and I

29:16.489 --> 29:17.757
were just talking about
possibly writing an offer.

29:17.790 --> 29:18.924
- Good.
- Yeah.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.393
- Well, guys, thanks.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.928
If you have any questions,
let me know, and just...

29:22.279 --> 29:23.430
- Absolutely.
- Appreciate you coming up.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.131
- It's a hell of a place.
Yeah, it's one of a kind.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.328
- This is gonna be
the Hamptons of LA.

29:27.329 --> 29:30.103
- I wouldn't go that
far, but-- [laughter]

29:33.205 --> 29:34.907
- You know I got some
showings right now?

29:34.941 --> 29:36.409
- I know we weren't
supposed to be here.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.744
- There's mold here?
- No this is--

29:38.778 --> 29:40.814
- I mean, have you had
the house mold remediated?

29:40.846 --> 29:42.915
- It has not been remediated,
'cause there's no mold.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.718
- This is a little
distracting, Josh.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.286
All these signs
around the house.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.320
- I do apologize.
- Sorry. I have to go.

- Yes. I'm a native, so yeah.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.650

- Yeah.

32:12.980 --> 32:13.500

32:13.532 --> 32:16.336
- So it went on the

is, it's only two years old.

32:29.648 --> 32:33.819
It's brand-new.

newly-constructed house.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.827
- Okay.

32:41.861 --> 32:43.262
- He's a Latin music producer,

his first Grammy.

If it was broken,

33:01.480 --> 33:02.882
it would be fixed

33:02.915 --> 33:04.499
- Okay perfect.
- Escrow.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.451
- Yeah that'll--
- Yeah.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.251
- Okay great.

33:06.286 --> 33:07.554
- Well here. Come
on outside too.

33:12.579 --> 33:15.228
What I love about the house
is the indoor/outdoor flow.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.695
- Right.
- Everything is open,

33:16.730 --> 33:19.398
so it really--it feels
like it's a big house.

33:22.535 --> 33:24.738
<i>That's a two-story
two-bedroom guest house</i>

33:24.770 --> 33:26.905
<i>which maybe could be
like a fashion studio...</i>

33:26.940 --> 33:28.307
- Mm-hmm.
- Or something for you.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.409
- Yeah.
- For your shoots.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.110
That'd be really
cute. [loud bang]

33:31.111 --> 33:32.345
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.480
- Holy sh--.
- Where did that come from?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.415
- That just scared the
hell out of me. I'm sorry.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.917
- I'm shaking. Look
at this. Oh, God.

33:38.951 --> 33:41.887
- Are you sure this place is
not haunted? What is this?

33:41.921 --> 33:43.890
- I don't want to mess
with any spirits, so...

33:43.923 --> 33:45.791
- No.
- I'd like to know now.

33:45.825 --> 33:48.327
- The only spirits in here
are vodka and tequila,

33:48.361 --> 33:52.832
but there are three little
girls that rule this house.

33:52.865 --> 33:55.300
<i>These girls are seriously
ruining the showings.</i>

33:55.335 --> 33:57.170
I mean, I don't mind,
like, a little playfulness,

33:57.202 --> 33:58.837
this and that,

33:58.872 --> 34:01.840
but the other brokers think
that I'm wasting their time,

34:01.875 --> 34:04.844
and they're gonna have a
bad taste in their mouth about it.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.712
<i>I love this primary bedroom.</i>

34:08.748 --> 34:10.115
<i>- Love the ceilings.</i>

34:10.150 --> 34:11.451
This feels like the
Hamptons actually.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.688
- Right?
- Oh, look at this.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.690
- This is an epic bathroom.
- Oh, wow.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.123
<i>- So much natural light.</i>

34:20.726 --> 34:22.228
- What about the freeway
noise? I mean, it's--

34:22.262 --> 34:24.129
- I mean, it could
get a little annoying.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.532
- Honestly, I don't
hear anything.

34:25.565 --> 34:28.400
- Mm-hmm.
- But there's a giant waterfall

34:28.434 --> 34:31.137
that, when I turn
it on, this pool

34:31.170 --> 34:33.539
goes over that edge
and falls down ten feet.

34:34.541 --> 34:35.842
<i>- Look at this! Oh, my gosh.</i>

34:35.875 --> 34:37.210
<i>- Oh, that is pretty.</i>

34:37.242 --> 34:38.545
This is like more modern.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.579
This is definitely
what I was looking for.

34:39.612 --> 34:41.414
- This is so her.
- It is a great family house,

34:41.447 --> 34:43.315
<i>but it definitely has
that young energy.</i>

34:43.349 --> 34:47.753
- Oh, I can already
see it. I love it.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.888
Oh.
- Uh-oh.

34:49.889 --> 34:51.423
- Uh-oh. Beware of ghosts?

34:51.458 --> 34:53.860
- There's mold here?
- No, no, no.

34:53.893 --> 34:54.927
This--

34:54.960 --> 34:56.128
- I mean, have you had the house

34:56.161 --> 34:57.297
mold remediated,

34:57.329 --> 34:58.831
and is there a clearance?

34:59.833 --> 35:02.601
- It has not been remediated,
'cause there's no mold.

35:02.635 --> 35:05.572
These little girls are
way bigger of an issue

35:05.605 --> 35:07.340
than I thought they
were gonna be.

35:07.373 --> 35:11.577
Yeah it's--so it's--
[laughs weakly]

35:11.610 --> 35:13.880
<i>Yeah, sure, some buyers
can kind of laugh it off,</i>

35:13.913 --> 35:17.499
<i>but when you're
spending $9 million,</i>

35:17.500 --> 35:19.184
it tends to not be
funny anymore.

35:19.219 --> 35:20.586
- This is a little
distracting, Josh.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.222
All the signs around the house.

35:22.255 --> 35:24.289
- Totally agree with
you, and I do apologize.

35:24.324 --> 35:25.592
- Sorry. I have to go.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.126
- It's all good.
I'll walk you out.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.827
- Thank you very much, Josh.

35:28.862 --> 35:30.597
- Next time, I promise that
the people won't be here.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.980
Thank you guys
so much for coming.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.432
- Thank you.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.733
- Let me know if you
have any questions.

35:34.768 --> 35:36.369
They're ready to deal.
- Okay.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.709
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck with everything,

35:38.710 --> 35:40.572
and let me know if you have
any questions whatsoever.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.749
- We will. I'm
gonna talk to her.

35:42.750 --> 35:43.175
- All right. Bye, guys.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.643
- Take care. Bye-bye.

35:46.913 --> 35:49.615
- Girls? Randi?

35:49.916 --> 35:52.552
- Yeah?
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

35:52.585 --> 35:54.954
- Yeah. Coming. Okay, what's up?

35:54.987 --> 35:58.291
- Your daughters are
sabotaging the showings. No joke.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.260
- Girls, I thought
you were working.

36:00.293 --> 36:01.827
- Who threw the
book, first of all?

36:01.860 --> 36:04.130
- A book? Girls.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.266
- We just really
don't want to move.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.335
- Yeah.

36:08.367 --> 36:09.668
- Josh, I'm sorry.

36:09.702 --> 36:11.471
We're really gonna
have to talk about it.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.273
<i>- Okay. This is frustrating.</i>

36:13.306 --> 36:15.541
I can't yell at 'em.
They're not my kids.

36:15.574 --> 36:18.210
<i>Randi's a huge client
where, if this goes well,</i>

36:18.244 --> 36:19.646
<i>I can sell them something else.</i>

36:19.679 --> 36:22.414
<i>These little girls could
cost me $1/2 million.</i>

36:22.449 --> 36:25.652
Cute in the beginning.
Not cute right now.

36:25.684 --> 36:29.188
You guys just have
a family powwow.

36:29.222 --> 36:31.291
- Okay. Come on,
girls. We're gonna have

36:31.324 --> 36:34.159
a little talk.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.661
Oh, my God.

36:35.695 --> 36:38.297
If this is what my daughter's
gonna be like, I swear...

36:41.101 --> 36:42.802
<i>- What is that?</i>

36:42.835 --> 36:44.903
- It's a handcrafted
design done by an artist.

36:44.938 --> 36:46.106
- Can you paint over it?

36:46.139 --> 36:47.474
- Why would you want to do that?

36:47.507 --> 36:48.675
- I know my clients,

36:48.708 --> 36:50.510
and I don't think
they would like that.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.177
- Perhaps this isn't the
house for your clients then?

36:57.684 --> 36:59.119
<i>- ♪ Fancy clothes, fancy cars ♪</i>

37:00.199 --> 37:02.588
<i>♪ I got it baby,
reach for the stars ♪</i>

37:02.621 --> 37:04.190
- What are you making, missy?

37:04.224 --> 37:07.599
- I'm making some Jimmy
Dean pork sausage. You know.

37:07.929 --> 37:10.630
- My favorite meal.
- You know I got the skills.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.164
<i>- ♪ It seem like a dream ♪</i>

37:11.197 --> 37:12.498
<i>♪ Now it's all about me ♪</i>

37:12.532 --> 37:13.900
- This is what we
do in Palm Springs.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.268
Josh pretends he's
butch and plays pool.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.237
That's not how
you hold a pool cue.

37:19.572 --> 37:21.423
- Go make me a drink.

37:21.424 --> 37:24.440

37:29.315 --> 37:30.750
- Hello?

37:30.784 --> 37:32.351
- Well hello.
- Welcome, Leetal.

37:32.385 --> 37:33.686
- Hey, James.
- What's going on?

37:33.719 --> 37:35.221
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

37:35.255 --> 37:36.255
- Good to see you too.

37:36.289 --> 37:37.356
- I didn't know you were coming.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.920
Welcome to your home.
I'm glad that you are here.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.226
How...
- Hey, thank you.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.628
- Are you? I'm doing
fantastic. How about yourself?

37:41.661 --> 37:43.544
- Well good. If I'd known,

37:43.545 --> 37:44.764
<i>I would have asked you</i>

37:44.797 --> 37:45.965
<i>to help me set up the
house, but everything's done.</i>

37:46.659 --> 37:47.634
<i>What do you think
of the staging?</i>

37:47.666 --> 37:48.835
<i>- I came, over the weekend,</i>

37:48.867 --> 37:50.503
and I think they
did such a good job.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.371
I'm very, very pleased.

37:52.739 --> 37:55.909
- Co-listing with Leetal
has been really tricky,

37:55.942 --> 37:58.577
<i>because her husband
built the house,</i>

37:58.610 --> 38:00.579
but she's also an agent

38:00.612 --> 38:02.815
with way too much
emotion in the deal.

38:02.849 --> 38:04.416
- That carpet. Is that
gonna stay there?

38:04.451 --> 38:05.751
- We're just trying it out.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.487
- I feel like it's
a little too small.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.422
To be honest, I'm not
really fond of this table.

38:09.456 --> 38:11.458
- Oh, boy. Okay.
- I would like to put something

38:11.490 --> 38:13.592
a little bit more
geometric there.

38:13.626 --> 38:16.127
Something that will really
complement the straight lines

38:16.128 --> 38:17.230
that we have going on...

38:17.262 --> 38:18.697
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

38:18.731 --> 38:20.567
- And now, she's
here for the showings.

38:20.599 --> 38:25.105
This is not typically the
way I like a co-listing to go.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.806
Here he is. Let's do this.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.742
- Here he is. I got this.

38:28.775 --> 38:30.309
- No, no. We'll do it together.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.411
- Sure thing.
- Mr. Reuben.

38:32.445 --> 38:33.646
- Yo.
- Come on in.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.479
- What's up, brother?
- Look at this.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.148
- How are you?
- Hello.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.449
- Looking good. Leetal, Joshua.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.617
- Hello, hello. Good to see you.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.529
Welcome to Bel Air.

38:40.530 --> 38:41.454
- Thank you.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.559
- We're super excited
for you to see this one.

38:43.889 --> 38:44.289
- Yeah. Me too.

38:44.324 --> 38:46.159
- Our strategy with the showings

38:46.192 --> 38:48.628
is very much to
divide and conquer.

38:48.661 --> 38:50.597
- To me, it sounds like
she's probably gonna be

38:50.630 --> 38:52.398
at every showing.
She's pretty hands-on.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.900
- And that's exactly
what we don't want.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.100
We don't need three
agents for one buyer.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.570
- Right.
- It's too much. It's overkill.

38:57.603 --> 38:58.938
- Well, let's just
break them up.

38:58.972 --> 39:00.407
You do your showings.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.675
I'll do my showings,
and if she's there,

39:01.708 --> 39:04.098
then there's only
two agents present.

39:04.099 --> 39:05.780
- That's what I think.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.413
<i>♪ ♪</i>

39:07.646 --> 39:11.384

39:15.221 --> 39:17.570
<i>- Oh, my gosh. The

39:17.900 --> 39:18.190

39:18.224 --> 39:20.259

39:22.228 --> 39:23.195

- Oh, yeah.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.530
- This is a (BLEEP) you view.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.561
If you don't like
it, (BLEEP) you.

39:26.562 --> 39:28.467

39:32.539 --> 39:34.507
<i>- This is cool. The
volume's great.</i>

39:34.541 --> 39:37.443
- We are looking at
a beautiful painting.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.679
- I love this west-facing
mountain view.

39:39.713 --> 39:42.681
I really do. I think
it's spectacular. Wow.

39:42.715 --> 39:44.479
- So tell me about your clients.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.485
- Super qualified. All
cash. A young couple.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.538
- Fabulous.
- Three kids. Yeah.

39:48.539 --> 39:49.521
- I can assure you that
you will not find a home

39:49.556 --> 39:51.516
with this price
point in Bel Air.

39:51.517 --> 39:53.626
- Yeah. I'm inclined to agree.
- 55--

39:53.659 --> 39:55.728
- 55-foot infinity pool.
Saltwater system.

39:55.762 --> 39:57.550
- And then you've got about--

39:57.551 --> 39:59.766
- Beautiful, large,
open space to entertain.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.101
- Wow.
- That's beautiful.

40:01.134 --> 40:02.534
- Our client-- he
would love this.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.804
The only thing
so far is the drive.

40:05.838 --> 40:08.240
Like, he likes to go out,
like, Sunset Strip and all that.

40:08.273 --> 40:12.119
- Once you hit Sunset and you
start coming up Roscomare--

40:12.449 --> 40:14.113
- I mean, when
you get to the house

40:14.114 --> 40:15.382
you get this beautiful view,

40:15.414 --> 40:16.548
and it's just--you
forget about your drive.

40:16.583 --> 40:17.717
- Right, right.
- Yeah.

40:17.751 --> 40:18.885
- I mean, I do.
- It's a good point.

40:18.918 --> 40:20.719
- Yeah. What the (BLEEP)?

40:20.753 --> 40:22.655
<i>I literally cannot
get a word out.</i>

40:22.688 --> 40:24.239
That's a first.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.260
<i>- The kitchen
is Italian kitchen.</i>

40:28.293 --> 40:29.929
<i>All Pedini cabinetry.</i>

40:29.963 --> 40:32.131
- The cabinetry is
just a little dark, so--

40:32.132 --> 40:34.266
<i>- I think it really
complements the center island,</i>

40:34.300 --> 40:35.568
because this is so light,

40:35.601 --> 40:37.237
but you know,
everything is changeable.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.606
So if they wanted to do
the lighter wood color finish,

40:39.639 --> 40:40.773
<i>definitely doable.
- Yeah.</i>

40:40.806 --> 40:42.775
<i>The island and the floors</i>

40:42.809 --> 40:45.445
kind of reminds me
of a dentist's office.

40:45.446 --> 40:47.447
- Well, it is a modern
architectural design home.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.782
- Yeah.

40:49.815 --> 40:53.530
- We're so used to
seeing these modern boxes

40:53.860 --> 40:54.420
that come in and--
- Oh, and this is definitely

40:54.454 --> 40:55.855
not a modern box.
- No, definitely not.

40:55.889 --> 40:57.590
You've got the
warmer textures and...

40:57.623 --> 40:59.125

The Bobbsey Twins.

50:51.451 --> 50:53.152
<i>- However, I want
Suzanne to know that,</i>

50:53.186 --> 50:55.255
<i>even though I'm a
couple hours away,</i>

50:55.288 --> 50:57.122
I'm still gonna stay
on top of this listing.

50:57.123 --> 50:58.891
- Josh and I have
a dirty little secret.

50:58.925 --> 51:00.193
- We do?
- Ooh.

51:00.226 --> 51:01.661
- So since we all met...
- Yeah.

51:01.695 --> 51:04.638
- Every night, we
jump into bed at 10:30.

51:04.639 --> 51:06.365
Light the candles.
Pour the tequila.

51:06.398 --> 51:08.101
- Do I want to know
what's coming next?

51:10.436 --> 51:11.938
- Then we turn on
"Three's Company."

51:11.971 --> 51:13.405
- Oh! Oh. You do?

51:13.440 --> 51:14.807
- We turn on
"Three's Company"...

51:14.840 --> 51:16.107
- You've been binging.

51:16.108 --> 51:17.309
- Starting from season one.
- Oh.

51:17.344 --> 51:18.411
- And that's what
we do every night.

51:18.445 --> 51:19.846
- Okay.
- We watch it.

51:19.878 --> 51:22.414
- Now that you know our
deep, dark secret, Suzanne,

51:22.449 --> 51:25.251
can I please seen an
impression of Chrissy Snow?

51:28.554 --> 51:30.222
- Come...

51:33.425 --> 51:35.394
- Who wrote that,
and who came up

51:35.427 --> 51:37.197
with--that was,
like, her demeanor?

51:37.230 --> 51:38.398
- You're looking at her.

51:38.431 --> 51:40.400
- How do you make
a dumb blonde...

51:40.432 --> 51:41.701
- Likeable?
- Likeable and lovable?

51:41.735 --> 51:43.102
- Yeah.

51:43.103 --> 51:46.639
- This threatens
nobody. She was funny.

51:46.672 --> 51:47.740
- Wow.

51:47.773 --> 51:50.342
That was impressive.
- All right.

51:50.376 --> 51:52.311
Well, I have heard
nothing from you.

51:52.344 --> 51:53.445
- Okay. Well...
- Mr. Josh?

51:53.480 --> 51:55.114
- There's not much to tell you.

51:55.148 --> 51:56.583
It's really--we
just hit the market.

51:56.615 --> 51:57.516
You know, I've been on
the phone with everybody.

51:57.550 --> 51:59.251
- All right.
- Everybody that's come here

51:59.284 --> 52:00.586
loves it.
- Great.

52:00.619 --> 52:02.549
- I think we're gonna
get this sold this time.

52:02.550 --> 52:03.558
- Okay.
- And you know what?

52:03.559 --> 52:04.724
With Soho House opening
and everything happening

52:04.757 --> 52:06.592
down here--gonna bring
in a new crowd, I think.

52:06.626 --> 52:09.728
- Yeah, so you don't want
us showing the house,

52:09.762 --> 52:11.563
so we're gonna need somebody
here to show the house.

52:11.597 --> 52:13.733
- Yeah. You're looking at him.
- Oh, you'd drive in?

52:13.766 --> 52:16.100
- At the moment, I don't
really have much option, but--

52:16.101 --> 52:17.637
- Do you have a helicopter?
- No.

52:17.670 --> 52:19.139
Do you want to loan me yours?

52:19.172 --> 52:20.940
- I loaned it to our
former president.

52:20.974 --> 52:24.411
- Oh, okay.

52:24.443 --> 52:25.478
- Look at those shoes.

52:25.512 --> 52:26.980
- Oh.
- Oh, these?

52:27.800 --> 52:29.516

- If you like these shoes...

52:29.548 --> 52:30.550

the Suzanne shoe.

52:36.956 --> 52:38.490
I'd like to just show you--

52:38.525 --> 52:40.226
- I want to see 'em.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.994

then you'll walk up there.

53:58.838 --> 54:00.806
that really understands
this kind of a property.

54:01.608 --> 54:03.428
I had to try it out,
because if we're gonna

54:03.429 --> 54:05.448
sell this to somebody,
I can't tell them

54:05.449 --> 54:07.146

54:23.295 --> 54:24.864
- Nope.
