00:31.800 --> 00:33.880
<i>Mom?</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:42.800
<i>Mom?</i>

00:48.200 --> 00:50.200
Christina?

01:07.720 --> 01:09.720
Listen.

01:11.880 --> 01:17.200
Sanna and I bought this for you.
It's from your home place.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.800
I've got nothing to do with those people.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.400
– Do you understand what she's singing?
– I don't like it.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.480
It's so screamy.

01:48.640 --> 01:52.600
And they steal, and lie.

01:53.960 --> 01:58.640
And they're nagging.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.920
We're here.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.080
It's your sister. We're going in.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.080
– We're not staying for long.
– No, alright.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.640
<i>Her father's passing–</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:52.560
<i>–and the loss of her sister</i>
<i>was a painful period in her life.</i>

02:56.560 --> 03:03.280
<i>Joik became her way</i>
<i>of surviving, find strength...</i>

03:05.000 --> 03:07.840
<i>A way of escaping–</i>

03:08.000 --> 03:12.760
<i>–and come home.</i>

03:14.320 --> 03:18.800
<i>Home for the summer graze,–</i>

03:18.960 --> 03:22.120
<i>–that Njenna loved so much.</i>

03:30.480 --> 03:34.800
– It's for grandma.
– Grandma.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.840
Grandma, please.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.920
Elle–Marja.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.120
My condolances.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.280
<i>Why didn't you come...</i>

04:05.440 --> 04:07.840
I don't understand.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.960
<i>Every year she insisted on</i>
<i>branding your calves.</i>

04:16.120 --> 04:20.079
– No, I don't understand.
<i>–She kept your herd.</i>

04:20.240 --> 04:23.640
<i>–Yes, you do.</i>
– I'm leaving now.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.560
<i>What a nice gákti.</i>

04:40.720 --> 04:44.160
– It's really nice.
– Thank you.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.120
– Yes, it's very nice.
– It's so beautiful.

04:50.920 --> 04:55.280
Look, grandma. Isn't it beautiful?

05:02.280 --> 05:05.800
Which she of course never had.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.720
We're going home now.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.880
We can stay with Jon–Olov
and your sister's family.

05:37.040 --> 05:41.080
Most of them are going straigth
to the calf branding.

05:41.240 --> 05:45.080
– That would be so much fun for Sanna...
– No, we're going home, Olle.

05:45.240 --> 05:50.600
I'm too tired to drive now.
We're leaving tomorrow.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.120
No, I'm taking my handbag.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.480
Where are you going?

05:59.640 --> 06:03.160
– I'm checking in at the hotel.
– What?

06:04.200 --> 06:08.240
– I'll be fine on my own.
– Come on, mom.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.600
Mom?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.360
Grandma!

06:51.040 --> 06:55.400
– Where are you from?
– From Småland.

06:55.560 --> 07:02.440
– Are you here on vacation?
– Yes. No, I'm retired now.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.480
– Teacher.
– Ok.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.680
– The cleaners are back.
– Is that them?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.680
When we were up on the mountain yesterday –

07:13.840 --> 07:17.520
– a bunch of them made a lot of noise.

07:17.680 --> 07:22.920
That's not alright when you've paid
for peace and quiet.

07:23.080 --> 07:27.000
– Yes, they're quite noisy.
– Yes, they are.

07:27.160 --> 07:33.280
It's annoying that they think they
can ride motocross everywhere.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.760
– This is a nature reserve.
– Yes, it is.

07:37.760 --> 07:42.320
I though the Sami where people of nature.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.800
Mom? Christina?

08:11.120 --> 08:14.000
I know you're in there.

08:14.160 --> 08:19.240
We're invited to the calf branding.
There's a helicopter leaving soon.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.280
Mom, could you please come with us?

08:23.440 --> 08:28.040
So that I'm not standing there
like some clueless moron.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.520
<i>Mom.</i>

08:34.799 --> 08:37.240
<i>I love you.</i>

08:40.960 --> 08:43.360
<i>Come on.</i>

08:45.960 --> 08:49.200
<i>Drink, row, read.</i>

08:49.360 --> 08:52.440
<i>Drink, row, read.</i>

08:52.600 --> 08:55.520
I don't know anything further.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.920
Shall I talk to grandma?

09:06.080 --> 09:09.400
No, screw it. Let's go.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.120
<i>Elle–Marja.</i>

10:22.000 --> 10:24.120
<i>Elle–Marja.</i>

10:36.600 --> 10:39.000
<i>Hold him.</i>

10:57.400 --> 11:00.400
<i>He's yours now.</i>

11:31.040 --> 11:34.280
<i>You should be on your way</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

11:34.440 --> 11:36.440
Yes.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.800
<i>Speak Sami.</i>

12:16.840 --> 12:21.120
<i>It's not long until Christmas.</i>

12:21.280 --> 12:24.360
<i>Your sister will be there too.</i>

12:32.240 --> 12:37.640
<i>This branding knife belonged to your father.</i>

12:39.360 --> 12:43.600
<i>He would've wanted</i>
<i>you to have it.</i>

12:50.600 --> 12:55.720
<i>You can tell that your mother</i>
<i>can't take it anymore.</i>

12:57.120 --> 13:01.880
<i>–It won't take long.</i>
<i>–And then you'll be back?</i>

13:06.280 --> 13:08.680
<i>Yes.</i>

13:21.400 --> 13:24.040
<i>Go over to your big sister.</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:54.400
<i>You won't make it a single day</i>
<i>at boarding school with such behaviour.</i>

13:56.400 --> 13:59.600
<i>I don't wanna go.</i>

14:02.240 --> 14:04.640
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

14:06.760 --> 14:09.240
<i>Close them.</i>

14:11.840 --> 14:15.680
<i>Then imagine</i>
<i>Norra Storfjället.</i>

14:17.640 --> 14:22.880
<i>–How does it sound?</i>
<i>–I can't remember</i>

14:23.040 --> 14:27.640
<i>If you can joik it,</i>
<i>it feels like home.</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:30.200
<i>So joik.</i>

15:05.680 --> 15:09.040
<i>Njenna is crying aboard the boat</i>

15:10.080 --> 15:14.600
<i>Njenna is crying aboard the boat</i>

15:27.200 --> 15:29.960
<i>Do not joik at the school.</i>

15:45.440 --> 15:47.840
<i>Hurry up.</i>

16:18.920 --> 16:21.320
One more time.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.720
Look. Tiny Lapp and Big Lapp.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.720
Good day!

16:31.080 --> 16:34.240
– Fucking Lapps.
– They've got to deal with the smell.

16:34.400 --> 16:38.200
Ask anyone.
You get a 100 to shoot one.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.119
Jåvva.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.800
<i>–I don't know the text ..</i>
<i>–Quiet.</i>

17:07.960 --> 17:12.119
– A tiny, poor child...
– Louder and in proper Swedish.

17:12.280 --> 17:18.160
A tiny, poor child I am,
but happy nevertheless.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.760
My father...

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
Hands.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.640
<i>–She can tell that I don't know it.</i>
<i>–Quiet.</i>

17:31.560 --> 17:36.400
I don't wanna hear any Sami.
We're gonna speak a language anyone understands.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
Hands.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.320
Elle–Marja.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.520
A tiny, poor child I am,
but happy nevertheless.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.360
I know my good Lord cares
about the young.

18:02.520 --> 18:06.760
He loves me, and he's devoted,
and his hand will guide me.

18:06.920 --> 18:11.800
His love is worth more than gold,
more than the entire world.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.480
Excellent.

18:15.320 --> 18:20.080
Elle–Marja is the one who gets to
welcome our guests from Uppsala.

18:26.800 --> 18:31.800
<i>A tiny, poor child I amr</i>

18:31.960 --> 18:37.560
<i>but happy nevertheless</i>

18:37.720 --> 18:42.720
<i>I know my good Lord cares</i>

18:42.880 --> 18:47.880
<i>about the young</i>

18:51.240 --> 18:53.200
Come on!

19:16.880 --> 19:21.600
– Do you think the King will come?
– No.

19:21.760 --> 19:26.240
– Why not?
– He doesn't live in Uppsala.

19:26.400 --> 19:30.080
– What abou the Queen?
– In line.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.520
Let's go.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.280
You have to talk Swedish.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.080
Elle–Marja.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.040
Do you want some coffee?

22:24.560 --> 22:26.960
Do you like books?

22:35.640 --> 22:38.280
You can have it.

22:41.280 --> 22:46.360
I'm not supposed to,
but I think you should have it.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.320
Why not?

22:52.600 --> 22:55.080
Are you interested in poetry?

22:59.040 --> 23:01.640
Are you?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
Wait...

23:05.440 --> 23:08.640
Try reading this one.

23:08.800 --> 23:13.120
It was my favourite poem
when I was your age.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.280
That one.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.120
I'm longing for the country
that doesn't exist, –

23:26.280 --> 23:31.640
– because what does,
I'm tired of desiring.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.200
Isn't it beautiful?

23:51.960 --> 23:55.600
To become a teacher...

23:55.760 --> 23:59.440
– What do you have to know?
– Well...

24:00.880 --> 24:03.560
You have to know everything.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.280
You have to know a little about everything.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.120
<i>Go back to your own bed.</i>

24:32.120 --> 24:34.920
<i>Go back to your own bed.</i>

25:29.200 --> 25:32.200
Shall I read about Uppsala?

25:53.080 --> 25:59.320
On the left side of the river
lies the church, university –

25:59.480 --> 26:02.880
– the castle
with its dominating location, –

26:03.040 --> 26:06.040
– look Uppsala Slott...

26:08.960 --> 26:14.560
...and the library...

26:16.200 --> 26:20.000
...called Carolina Rediviva.

26:23.920 --> 26:29.120
<i>–I want someone nicer.</i>
<i>–Your gákti is very nice.</i>

26:33.880 --> 26:38.120
Welcome.
We would like to hand you a gift.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.200
It's a <i>riegka</i>
made from reindeer antlers.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.000
It's an old, Sami tradition.

26:47.720 --> 26:52.160
– What do you think?
– <i>It sounds Swedish.</i>

26:54.120 --> 26:58.160
<i>Elle–Marja speaks Swedish...</i>

27:00.920 --> 27:03.240
<i>Stop it.</i>

27:05.760 --> 27:07.920
<i>Stop joiking.</i>

27:13.080 --> 27:18.200
<i>–Elle–Marja speaks Swedish...</i>
<i>–Stop joiking.</i>

27:40.480 --> 27:43.160
Are you having visitors today too?

27:45.280 --> 27:48.200
I thought so.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.000
– Welcome.
– Thank you.

28:17.160 --> 28:21.760
– Emanuel Wennerberg.
– Christina Lajler. 

28:21.920 --> 28:25.920
– Christina Lajler.
– Hedda Nordström.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.520
Elle–Marja.

28:36.480 --> 28:40.600
Welcome.
We would like to hand you a gift.

28:40.760 --> 28:47.600
It's a <i>riegka,</i>
which is an old, Sami tradition, –

28:47.760 --> 28:51.440
– made from reindeer antlers.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.000
Thank you very much, Elle–Marja.

29:05.600 --> 29:08.640
The clothes are so beautiful.

29:14.480 --> 29:18.880
It's so blonde.
Not very stiff.

29:29.560 --> 29:33.760
Let's take a picture of those
two holding hands.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.120
Of course.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.680
Elle–Marja. Come closer.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.080
And smile.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.640
Come in.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.280
– Take a seat.
– Elle–Marja, take it off.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
18,0.

30:37.880 --> 30:41.040
– What are you doing?
– So...

30:46.840 --> 30:49.160
15,5.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.600
Teeth are intact.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.320
What are you doing?

31:26.200 --> 31:28.600
3,2.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.080
4,4.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.840
Are both parents Lapps?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.960
Yes.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.760
Good. She can go over there
and take her clothes off.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.560
Stand on the bench.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.840
– Now...
– Elle–Marja.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.920
Take your clothes off.

32:47.560 --> 32:53.120
– Does she understand?
– Elle–Marja, be a good example.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.880
Elle–Marja!

33:23.760 --> 33:25.560
Good.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.320
Arms behind your head.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
Elle–Marja.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.960
Can she keep her hands behind
her head?

34:01.520 --> 34:03.520
Like that.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.120
Good. Take the picture.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.880
– Miss Lajler comes from Småland?
– Yes.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.679
– I was born there.
– Turn around.

34:22.840 --> 34:26.199
It's very beautiful.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.840
Njenna.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.200
Here comes the circus animal.

35:21.360 --> 35:26.400
They are less developed.
That's why they look like that.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.880
Take that back.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.400
– What?
– Take that back!

35:32.560 --> 35:37.240
– Did I say anything?
– Take back what you said!

35:37.400 --> 35:41.560
– There's a disease which makes...
– Take that back!

35:43.920 --> 35:46.120
Hold her!

35:46.280 --> 35:48.280
Let go!

35:51.920 --> 35:53.920
Let go!

35:56.960 --> 36:01.720
– You're as much of a Lapp as I!
– Turn the head!

36:33.120 --> 36:36.680
I've got the smell on my fingers now.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.960
Wait!

38:47.880 --> 38:51.440
Hello there!

38:51.600 --> 38:53.880
The dance...

38:57.320 --> 39:01.520
– Let's go.
– You can come if you want to!

39:03.360 --> 39:05.760
We're going now.

39:06.760 --> 39:11.440
Are you joining?
We'll help out with the laundry!

40:02.920 --> 40:06.120
<i>–Go home.</i>
<i>–Where are you going?</i>

40:10.920 --> 40:13.320
<i>Go home, Njenna.</i>

40:18.120 --> 40:20.920
<i>Get down.</i>

40:22.000 --> 40:26.560
<i>Get down.</i>
<i>Down, Njenna. Get down.</i>

42:18.760 --> 42:25.200
I've been thinking about Standard Swedish.
That's what you're speaking in Uppsala, right?

42:25.360 --> 42:29.400
It's to completely different things.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.680
– This and that.
– That's what I've been saying.

42:32.840 --> 42:35.720
I don't get it.

42:35.880 --> 42:39.840
That doesn't surprise me.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Hey.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.960
Hey.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.360
Yes?

43:17.200 --> 43:19.200
Come.

43:20.720 --> 43:25.080
I'm not good at this
Or... I don't know...

43:49.160 --> 43:51.160
I'm sorry!

44:21.080 --> 44:23.160
What's your name?

44:24.200 --> 44:26.920
Can I guess?

44:27.080 --> 44:29.520
Something exotic?

44:30.560 --> 44:32.360
No.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.960
Christina.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.920
Are you called something exotic?

44:42.400 --> 44:45.160
Yes... Niklas Wikander.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.640
Nice.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.840
Thanks.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.680
What's Uppsala like?

45:01.320 --> 45:03.800
Better than this.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.960
I'm moving there.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.720
Wanna go for a walk?

45:12.720 --> 45:16.640
What do you mean? Go for a walk?

45:18.320 --> 45:21.240
Do you want me on top of Laxfjället?

45:21.400 --> 45:23.280
What?

45:23.440 --> 45:27.920
– On top of Laxfjället?
– What's going on there?

45:28.080 --> 45:32.840
That's where they're taking girls.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.680
And do what?

45:35.840 --> 45:38.320
Look at the view.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.560
How do you know?

45:45.440 --> 45:48.040
It's what I've heard.

46:21.720 --> 46:24.240
Wanna go for a swim?

46:25.280 --> 46:27.880
You don't like swimming?

46:37.400 --> 46:39.400
<i>Elle–Marja.</i>

46:44.760 --> 46:46.760
Where do you live?

46:46.920 --> 46:49.960
– What?
– Where do you live?

46:50.120 --> 46:53.480
– På Kåbovägen. Hvorfor spør du?
– Jeg må gå.

46:53.640 --> 46:56.120
<i>Elle–Marja.</i>

46:57.560 --> 47:02.840
<i>–I had to tell...</i>
– I don't understand, fucking Lapp.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.800
Do Elle–Marja want to say something?

49:04.120 --> 49:06.120
<i>Sister?</i>

49:16.680 --> 49:19.080
<i>Answer me.</i>

49:26.760 --> 49:29.880
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

49:35.960 --> 49:37.960
<i>Stop it.</i>

49:42.280 --> 49:45.160
<i>I can't stay.</i>

49:55.360 --> 49:57.440
<i>Sister?</i>

50:47.280 --> 50:48.880
<i>Njenna.</i>

50:53.880 --> 50:56.280
<i>Can we talk?</i>

51:01.400 --> 51:03.200
<i>Njenna, come here.</i>

51:03.360 --> 51:07.200
Don't you have a Swede
to take care of you now?

51:07.360 --> 51:10.160
Go to him.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.440
Come in.

51:49.600 --> 51:52.440
I want to study more.

51:53.880 --> 51:56.680
– Alright?
– In Uppsala.

51:56.840 --> 52:01.960
You need papers for that.
Exams, certificates and so on.

52:02.880 --> 52:05.960
Could you write a paper for me?

52:06.120 --> 52:09.960
I'm sorry, but I can't.

52:12.840 --> 52:15.800
Why not?

52:17.560 --> 52:22.040
You can't keep on studying
after going to this school.

52:22.200 --> 52:24.240
Why not?

52:24.400 --> 52:28.080
You don't know the same things
as Swedish children does.

52:28.240 --> 52:32.920
– I've done everything right.
– Yes, but they're learning different things.

52:37.200 --> 52:43.080
Elle–Marja, you're very good,
but your family needs you here.

52:43.240 --> 52:48.960
– Only you know what it takes to be here.
– What if I don't wanna be here?

52:51.280 --> 52:54.760
There's nothing I can
do about that.

52:55.560 --> 52:58.600
Who's in charge then?

53:01.720 --> 53:05.360
According to the scientific reports,
you people are not made for the city.

53:05.520 --> 53:10.000
Your brains are...
You don't have what it takes.

53:11.160 --> 53:15.160
You have to be up here,
or you'll die out.

53:20.120 --> 53:23.160
You could write a letter.

53:24.320 --> 53:26.120
Unfortunately.

54:07.120 --> 54:11.360
– Help!
<i>–Quiet. Be quiet!</i>

54:11.520 --> 54:15.120
<i>Give me your belt. I'm leaving.</i>

54:15.280 --> 54:18.080
<i>Quiet.</i>

54:18.240 --> 54:21.120
<i>Be quiet.</i>

54:21.280 --> 54:24.480
<i>Are you seeing that Swede?</i>

54:28.840 --> 54:33.600
<i>Nobody likes you.</i>
<i>Nobody wants you here.</i>

54:34.440 --> 54:37.240
<i>You're only thinking about yourself.</i>

54:38.240 --> 54:41.160
<i>Nobody wants you here.</i>

54:42.840 --> 54:46.480
<i>You're a Lapp child</i>
<i>who doesn't understand anything.</i>

54:46.640 --> 54:51.680
<i>Your brains are tiny.</i>
<i>Nobody wants us.</i>

54:53.040 --> 54:57.040
<i>You're a bunch of idiots</i>
<i>who can't think for themselves.</i>

59:27.080 --> 59:31.800
– Yes?
– Good evening. I'm here to see Niklas.

59:31.960 --> 59:34.960
He's already in Snärkes.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.240
In...?

59:38.400 --> 59:44.000
– Did Niklas go to Sörmland–Närkes?
– I think so.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.760
But Niklas invited me.

59:49.880 --> 59:53.120
You'll find him at the dance.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.840
Yes?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.120
Sorry, but Niklas said that
I could come visiting.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.480
And that I could stay here.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.080
Alright.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.920
Elise.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.120
Just like in Für Elise.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.400
We were in the middle of eating dinner.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.240
I didn't quite catch your name.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.280
– Christina.
– How do you know Niklas?

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.600
From a dance.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.520
At Udden.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.920
I'm from Småland, –

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.240
– but my sister works in Norrland.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.560
– Gustav comes from Småland too.
– Yes, it's true.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.400
Where's your family living?

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.040
In Småland. About –

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.880
– everywhere.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.400
– Nice cake.
– That's good.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.720
We were going to serve the same
on at the party.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.200
– We made a bed for you downstairs.
– Who's that?

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.440
– Someone named Christina.
– Who? Who's that?

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.920
Close the door.
You can't just invite people over.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760
Hey.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.480
I came by train today.
I've got nowhere to stay.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.920
Then I remembered that you
lived here.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.040
– I didn't mean to occupy your room.
– No problem.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.680
– Do you want one?
– No.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:41.240
– Sure?
– Yes.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.640
Can I stay for a couple of days?

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.000
Yes...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.480
Could you ask?

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.600
Yes.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.000
I'll ask.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Sorry.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.520
What have you done?

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.320
– Nothing.
– Nothing?

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.600
It was an accident.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.960
What kind of accident?

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.520
An accident.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.000
What are you doing?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.319
Coffe-cheese.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:27.000
– It tastes good.
– What?

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.960
I'm leaving it here.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.120
Maybe another time.
I prefer milk.

01:09:47.319 --> 01:09:50.120
Did you ask?

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:53.359
Niklas, could you come here for a bit?

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:56.360
I'll do it.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.000
We're worried that you haven't thought this
through with regards to Christina.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.480
The responsibility.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.920
I don't have any responsibility.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.480
Yes, if you...
If she becomes pregnant.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.480
Perhaps she is already?

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.720
– No.
– Are you sure? Cause we heard...

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.600
– Why is she here? Do you know?
– Yes, because she...

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.280
– She needed a place to stay.
– You don't know what she wants.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.840
Thanks for visiting.
Make it short.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.400
– Where is she going...
– That's not your responsibility.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.600
It's for the best that she
goes back home.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.040
– They have resources.
– Who?

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.280
The Lapps.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.920
I thought it was nice of
you to come.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.240
But...

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.040
Sorry.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.120
That's what they're like.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.600
Can we still see each other?

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.000
Tell them that I could work here.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.760
What?

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.760
Tell them that I could work here.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.280
I could clean and so on.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.000
No pupils after the bells have chimed.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.040
Yes?

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.960
– It's not the first time.
– No, it isn't.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.840
I don't have time for this.
What's her name?

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.080
– What's your name?
– Christina Lajler.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.520
Christina Lajler.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.880
Girls, this is your new classmate.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.720
– My name is Christina Lajler.
– Yes.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.440
Five, six, seven, eight!

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.480
Thank you. Stretch out.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.400
Have you not had PE before?

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.520
Talk to Elsa.
Tell her to show you.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.280
Come back.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.080
Five, six, seven, eight!

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.560
You?

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.960
Come here.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.160
Are you using lipstick?

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.000
Shall I apply some?

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.240
Look up.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.560
And then...

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.200
Then there's this.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.040
Have you lived in Germany?

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.000
Ever been to Berlin?

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.280
What do you need this for?

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.400
What is it for?
Are you going after someone?

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.760
What is it for?
Say something!

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.320
If you're not using it,
I'll take it.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.400
Look at that dress. Look.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:32.120
Why does she insist on wearing
patterned clothes?

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.840
It's hideous.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.400
Any plans for the weekend?

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.360
– Wanna do something?
– Christina!

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.360
The principal wants to talk with you.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.600
SEMESTER FEE

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.080
200 KRONER FOR 2 SEMESTERS

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.480
Niklas?

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.720
There's a seat available here.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.280
Niklas? There's someone here to see you.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.560
Go on.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.800
Olof, I can't... Thank you.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.280
Do wou want anything?

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.360
Hello. Karin.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.680
Christina.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.320
Are you and Niklas old friends?

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.600
Not that old.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.480
Where are you studying?

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.320
On a regular school.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.800
Aren't you from Lappland?
The one Niklas met there?

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.280
Which means you can joik...jodle...

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.120
– Joik.
– For us.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.440
That would be great.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.640
– I've never heard it.
– Me neither.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:26.720
Ellen and I study antropology, so we're
doing some field work up there.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.160
Let it be a birthday present for Niklas.
A birthday joik.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:38.920
Niklas? You'd like a birthday joik, wouldn't you?

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.640
Yes...

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.040
Yes.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:51.560
Turn the music off, will you?

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.720
We're going to here a birthday joik.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.440
– What is she doing?
– Calling the animals.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.520
– No, it's a ritual.
– That would be great..

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.000
Sorry.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.840
I thought it was nice.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.600
Perhaps a bit long.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.920
I need to borrow some money.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.280
I'm not pregnant.
It's for the school.

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.240
Why don't you ask your
own parents?

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.600
They're dead.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.760
They are?

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.800
They are?

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:34.640
My dad is.
Mom owns reindeer.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.080
But your name is Christina?

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.080
Elle–Marja.

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.240
Niklas, come here for a second.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:05.360
<i>This is for you.</i>

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:47.240
<i>–Come on.</i>
<i>–Not in melted water.</i>

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:53.080
<i>You're smelly.</i>
<i>–I can't smell anything.</i>

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.640
<i>You can smell it yourself.</i>

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
<i>Come on.</i>

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.560
<i>Hold onto me.</i>
<i>Can I show you something?</i>

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.520
<i>Lay down.</i>

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.720
<i>Slowly.</i>

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:50.280
<i>Lay down. Slowly.</i>

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.280
<i>It's just like flying, isn't it?</i>

01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:00.800
<i>Isn't it lovely?</i>

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.440
<i>Grandma.</i>

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.360
<i>What am I supposed to do</i>
<i>with that much cream?</i>

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.240
<i>And for what?</i>

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.880
<i>Mom?</i>

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.600
<i>Can we talk?</i>

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.720
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.440
<i>–Can we go somewhere?</i>
<i>–Why can't we talk here.</i>

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.960
<i>Or should we build</i>
<i>a nicer house?</i>

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.080
<i>Read!</i>

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.040
<i>Read!</i>

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.280
<i>That's not your name.</i>

01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.960
<i>I'm not Elle–Marja anymore.</i>

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.520
<i>I would like to sell all my reindeers</i>
<i>and those my father left me.</i>

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.760
<i>We don't have the money, Elle–Marja.</i>

01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.360
<i>–We have daddy's silver belt.</i>
<i>–No.</i>

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:04.240
<i>We could sell it to someone else.</i>

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.280
<i>Watch out so you don't become Swedish.</i>

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:22.240
<i>I'm not just sending you away.</i>
<i>Who's gonna watch out for your reindeers?</i>

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.640
<i>I don't want to live with you.</i>

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.960
<i>–I don't want to be a circus animal.</i>
<i>–Get out.</i>

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
<i>Get out.</i>

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.760
<i>She's over there.</i>

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.880
<i>Forgive me.</i>

01:41:23.305 --> 01:41:29.275
