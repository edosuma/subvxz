Beef stroganoff.                

00:58.659 --> 01:00.091
                 Beef stroganoff
                 for Archie?    

01:00.093 --> 01:01.292
            Ma, you know he says

01:01.294 --> 01:03.128
    anything but meat           
    and potatoes makes him sick.

01:03.130 --> 01:07.532
Well, I'll just tell him        
it's Yankee stew.               

01:07.534 --> 01:10.268
See, Archie don't               
get sick on food,               

01:10.270 --> 01:11.502
just on names.                  

01:14.406 --> 01:15.640
That figures.                   

01:15.642 --> 01:17.842
              Like, he won't eat
              kidney beans      

01:17.844 --> 01:19.010
            because of the name.

01:20.345 --> 01:23.648
    And we never have           
          rump roast.           

01:25.284 --> 01:26.885
        Uh, Ma, this has        
    sour cream in it.           

01:26.887 --> 01:28.019
    Archie hates sour cream.    

01:28.021 --> 01:30.388
      Well, he won't know       
         the difference         

01:30.390 --> 01:32.590
  once he puts ketchup on it.   

01:32.592 --> 01:34.159
                         GLORIA:
                         Hello? 

01:34.161 --> 01:36.061
          Oh, Gloria!           

01:36.063 --> 01:38.830
Hey! Boy, am I glad to see you! 

01:38.832 --> 01:39.964
      Hi!                       
            Hi, honey.          

01:39.966 --> 01:41.166
You going to stay               
home tonight?                   

01:41.168 --> 01:43.568
     No, I have to be back      
     at the store at 9:00.      

01:43.570 --> 01:45.369
        How long is that damn   
        inventory going to take?

01:45.371 --> 01:46.437
I don't know, Michael.          

01:46.439 --> 01:48.940
We're reorganizing              
the whole store.                

01:48.942 --> 01:51.076
We could be finished tonight,   
tomorrow-- I don't know.        

01:51.078 --> 01:52.911
            Gloria,             
it's been two weeks since we... 

01:52.913 --> 01:54.579
I know, Michael.                

01:57.049 --> 01:58.649
But what can I do?              

01:58.651 --> 02:01.552
             Try waking me up   
             when you come home.

02:03.555 --> 02:04.823
Michael,                        
it's so late                    

02:04.825 --> 02:06.091
and I'm tired.                  

02:06.093 --> 02:09.493
             Gloria, it's       
             unhealthy this way.

02:09.495 --> 02:12.630
It's only been two weeks,       
Michael.                        

02:12.632 --> 02:14.332
I mean, what do monks do?       

02:14.334 --> 02:16.067
            Monks pray a lot.   

02:18.170 --> 02:20.271
Try to be                       
a little understanding, Michael.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.706
                  Oh, I'm sorry.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.075
              We'll be finished 
              at the store soon.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.376
    Yeah.                       

02:25.378 --> 02:27.078
         I'm gonna go upstairs  
         and change clothes now.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.479
         I'll help you.

     let's get it in here!      

02:46.566 --> 02:47.899
     Edith, come on, Edith!     

02:47.901 --> 02:49.100
                Mike and Gloria,
                where are you?  

02:49.102 --> 02:50.501
Archie, what is it?             
What's the matter?              

02:50.503 --> 02:52.103
             Hurry up, now. Come
             on here! Come on!  

02:52.105 --> 02:53.104
                 I'm timing you.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.105
         Hey, let's go.         

02:54.107 --> 02:56.440
            Hold it!            

02:56.442 --> 02:57.842
    I was just timing           
          all of you.           

02:57.844 --> 02:59.443
     See how long it'd take     
          all of youse          

02:59.445 --> 03:01.445
         to get in here         
and give me the big hello.      

03:01.447 --> 03:03.047
The loving spouse made it       
        in two seconds,         

03:03.049 --> 03:04.649
    the little girl made it     
    in three seconds,           

03:04.651 --> 03:07.285
    and Meathead, as usual,     
    brung up the rear there     

03:07.287 --> 03:08.887
at four and 2/10 seconds.       

03:11.090 --> 03:14.793
Archie, you got                 
a beautiful new watch.          

03:14.795 --> 03:16.594
            Oh, Edith, beautiful
            ain't the word.     

03:16.596 --> 03:20.098
    That there is a genuine     
    100% chromonometer there.   

03:20.100 --> 03:22.433
                Look at all     
                those dials.    

03:22.435 --> 03:23.601
Look at them, little girl.      

03:23.603 --> 03:25.069
          Count them.           
     Seven of them, seven.      

03:25.071 --> 03:29.373
    Is there anything there     
that tells you what time it is? 

03:29.375 --> 03:31.242
  Ah, jeez, Edith, certainly!   

03:31.244 --> 03:33.278
The big hands tell you the time.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.280
    But see, that ain't all     
this watch tells you, see?      

03:35.282 --> 03:36.881
                This is what you
                call one of them

03:36.883 --> 03:37.949
                 round-the-world
                 watches, right?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.350
        Over here, I can tell   

03:39.352 --> 03:41.585
             that it's morning  
             in China, see that?

03:41.587 --> 03:44.555
     Right at this moment,      
    800 million Chinks          

03:44.557 --> 03:47.258
        is sitting down         
         to breakfast.          

03:47.260 --> 03:48.759
             Archie,            
             in the first place,

03:48.761 --> 03:50.094
        they are called Chinese.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.263
  That's what I said, Chinks.   

03:54.333 --> 03:56.134
        And other things        
    this watch can tell you.    

03:56.136 --> 03:57.302
      Like, for instance,       

03:57.304 --> 03:59.337
     do you know what shape     
    the moon is in tonight?     

03:59.339 --> 04:01.039
No, but I'll look.              

04:01.041 --> 04:02.373
Get back here, Edith!           

04:02.375 --> 04:03.374
Get back here.                  

04:03.376 --> 04:05.376
         Let the watch          
         tell you that.         

04:05.378 --> 04:07.645
 I can read it right over here, 
              see?              

04:07.647 --> 04:09.547
    Tonight, the moon           
    is in the quarter phase.    

04:09.549 --> 04:11.149
  See, that's the whole point   
         of this watch.         

04:11.151 --> 04:13.417
With this watch, you never have 
to look at the moon again.      

04:14.786 --> 04:15.786
                Look at that.   

04:15.788 --> 04:17.588
                 It's got       
                 the date on it.

04:17.589 --> 04:20.524
  I'll tell you what it's got   
      on it, little girl.       

04:20.526 --> 04:23.794
        See there?              
    It's got the date on it.    

04:23.796 --> 04:24.829
It's right here in that--       

04:24.831 --> 04:26.364
         They call that         
    the calendar part, see?     

04:26.366 --> 04:27.531
        [BUZZING]               

04:27.533 --> 04:28.666
                    What's that?

04:28.668 --> 04:29.834
              A-ha.             

04:29.836 --> 04:32.103
    That there is the alarm.    

04:32.105 --> 04:33.604
  That's for suppertime, see?   

04:33.606 --> 04:35.206
      And that's the alarm      
      you're going to hear      

04:35.208 --> 04:36.407
 every night around this time,  
             Edith,             

04:36.409 --> 04:38.442
    to show you that supper     
    should be on the table.     

04:38.444 --> 04:41.812
         Well, suppose          
      I'm in another room,      

04:41.814 --> 04:43.114
      and I don't hear it?      

04:43.116 --> 04:44.949
Then you'll hear the old alarm, 
              Ma.               

04:44.951 --> 04:47.451
    "Edith, get supper          
         on the table!"         

04:49.288 --> 04:51.856
Archie, that sounded            
just like you.                  

04:51.858 --> 04:53.057
          Oh, really?           

04:53.059 --> 04:54.625
    Then why don't it           
         make you move?         

04:54.627 --> 04:56.261
Oh!                             
             "Oh!"              

04:56.263 --> 04:58.062
        I tell you what.        
     I'm going to time you.     

04:58.064 --> 05:00.464
  I'll give you five minutes    
  to get supper on the table.   

05:00.466 --> 05:01.866
            ARCHIE: Hold it,    
            hold it, hold it.   

05:01.868 --> 05:04.468
    Get ready. Get set. Go!     

05:06.471 --> 05:08.806
        Oh, Daddy.              

05:08.808 --> 05:10.674
Why do you make Ma              
run like that?                  

05:10.676 --> 05:12.443
          What are you talking  
          about? She loves this.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.078
Daddy,                          
you're hopeless.                
                        Ahh!    

05:14.080 --> 05:16.014
Arch, where'd you get that watch
            anyway?             

05:16.016 --> 05:17.315
I got it off of a friend.       

05:28.060 --> 05:29.260
  See that? What'd I tell you?  

05:29.262 --> 05:32.130
         She loves it.          
     She's pretty fast too.     

05:32.132 --> 05:33.597
              Arch, what friend?

05:33.599 --> 05:36.434
     Oh, a guy by the name      
    of Tommy Macklin.           

05:36.436 --> 05:40.738
    This here is a 300-buck     
    registered Omega.           

05:40.740 --> 05:42.006
Daddy, what would               
make you buy                    

05:42.008 --> 05:43.874
an expensive watch              
like that?                      

05:43.876 --> 05:45.276
                 Because the guy
                 come up to me, 

05:45.278 --> 05:46.277
                he said he's got

05:46.279 --> 05:47.278
                his mother      
                in the hospital,

05:47.280 --> 05:48.579
              he needed a little
              extra cash.       

05:48.581 --> 05:50.348
    How am I doing, Archie?     

05:50.350 --> 05:51.849
             ARCHIE: Oh, take it
             easy there, Edith. 

05:51.851 --> 05:54.685
 You better save a little steam 
     for the home stretch.      

05:54.687 --> 05:56.220
         Oh, thank you.         

05:56.222 --> 05:57.888
Gee, Daddy, that was            
really sweet of you             

05:57.890 --> 05:59.257
to help a friend                
like that.                      

05:59.259 --> 06:01.292
    What did your father do?    

06:01.294 --> 06:03.594
He gave a friend                
$300 for that watch.            

06:03.596 --> 06:07.031
 Archie, that's a lot of money. 

06:07.033 --> 06:08.166
                 Hold it, Edith.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.601
            I didn't pay no $300
            for the watch.      

06:10.603 --> 06:12.437
      Well, didn't you say      
      it was a $300 watch?      

06:12.439 --> 06:14.638
          Yeah, but I didn't say
          I paid that much.     

06:14.640 --> 06:16.574
        Ain't you never heard   
        of bargains?            

06:16.576 --> 06:18.209
                 The guy gave me
                 a little off.  

06:18.211 --> 06:19.810
Oh, then how much               
did it cost, Daddy?             

06:19.812 --> 06:22.646
      Twenty-five dollars.      

06:22.648 --> 06:25.149
     That's not a bargain,      
        that's a steal.         

06:25.151 --> 06:26.584
            A steal!            

06:26.586 --> 06:28.853
 That don't sound right to me.  

06:28.855 --> 06:30.554
  The clock is running on you,  
             Edith.             

06:30.556 --> 06:32.590
              Oh.               

06:32.592 --> 06:34.425
    Your friend Tommy           

06:34.427 --> 06:36.260
    has a sick mother           
        in the hospital         

06:36.262 --> 06:39.330
      and all you gave him      
 for a watch like that was $25? 

06:39.332 --> 06:40.798
      Wait a minute there,      
          little girl.          

06:40.800 --> 06:42.600
    I didn't want the watch     
      in the first place.       

06:42.602 --> 06:45.036
    The guy comes up to me.     
He wants to sell it there.      

06:45.038 --> 06:46.270
         He asked $25.          

06:46.272 --> 06:48.806
What am I supposed to do,       
        bargain him up?         

06:48.808 --> 06:50.108
        Dinner's ready!         

06:50.110 --> 06:51.709
                Hey! I think    
                you done that   

06:51.711 --> 06:53.044
            in a little under   
            five minutes.       

06:53.046 --> 06:55.313
      Well, that was good,      
    wasn't it, Archie?          

06:55.315 --> 06:57.315
            Well, it's time that
            could be improved,  

06:57.317 --> 06:58.616
                    you know?   

06:58.618 --> 07:00.518
             Maybe I'll buy you 
             a pair of sneakers.

07:01.853 --> 07:03.021
Daddy, how can                  
you face                        

07:03.023 --> 07:04.555
your friend Tommy               
at work                         

07:04.557 --> 07:05.623
with you wearing                
his watch?                      

07:05.625 --> 07:07.225
             I don't have       
             to face him at all.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.926
                He works way    
                over Pier 48.   

07:08.928 --> 07:10.728
You mean he works               
on the docks?                   

07:10.730 --> 07:11.862
                That's right.   

07:11.864 --> 07:13.131
Well, then that explains it.    

07:13.133 --> 07:14.365
        What does it explain?   

07:14.367 --> 07:17.035
Arch, the docks                 
is New York's famous grab bag.  

07:17.037 --> 07:18.836
They unload things there        
and they disappear.             

07:18.838 --> 07:20.038
Tommy sold you a hot watch.     

07:20.040 --> 07:21.839
                Get out of here.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.641
Come on, weren't you suspicious?

07:23.643 --> 07:26.444
I mean, why would a guy sell you
a $300 watch for 25 bucks?      

07:26.446 --> 07:28.946
    Listen, wise guy, a guy     
  comes and offers me a deal,   

07:28.948 --> 07:30.248
I don't ask no questions.       

07:30.250 --> 07:32.683
  I know. I know you don't ask  
         any questions.         

07:32.685 --> 07:35.119
    Nobody does, and that's     
what's wrong with this country. 

07:35.121 --> 07:36.987
        Ah, jeez,               
he's off on "the country" again!

07:36.989 --> 07:38.989
  That's right. That's right.   

07:38.991 --> 07:40.191
Nobody's asking questions       
            anymore.            

07:40.193 --> 07:41.592
Let me ask you a question.      

07:41.594 --> 07:42.593
MIKE: What?                     

07:42.595 --> 07:43.761
     Why don't you shut up?     

07:43.763 --> 07:45.363
      You see? That's it.       

07:45.365 --> 07:47.131
         That's exactly         
    what I'm talking about.     

07:47.133 --> 07:49.067
Nobody cares. Not even Congress.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.668
        President Nixon         
     does whatever he wants     

07:50.670 --> 07:52.270
          and Congress          
lets him get away with it.      

07:52.272 --> 07:53.404
 They don't ask any questions.  

07:53.406 --> 07:54.638
  What are you talking about?   

07:54.640 --> 07:56.274
Congress can ask Mr. Nixon      
      anything they want.       

07:56.276 --> 07:58.076
        Sure, they can,         
but it won't do any good.       

07:58.078 --> 07:58.943
    He never answers anyone.    

08:00.512 --> 08:01.612
    I don't blame him.          

08:01.614 --> 08:03.847
          They're all           
     a bunch of dumbbells.      

08:03.849 --> 08:05.483
 I go along with my president.  

08:05.485 --> 08:07.718
      Ask me no questions,      
     I'll tell you no lies.     

08:10.556 --> 08:12.056
So what are you saying?         

08:12.058 --> 08:13.558
We shouldn't ask you            
any questions                   

08:13.560 --> 08:15.293
about hot watches?              

08:15.295 --> 08:16.727
          Will you cut that out?

08:16.729 --> 08:17.828
        This ain't no hot watch.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.564
            And don't be casting
            no dispersions      

08:19.566 --> 08:21.566
    on the guy that sold me     
    the watch, Tommy Macklin,   

08:21.568 --> 08:23.033
            because everybody   
            who knows Tommy     

08:23.035 --> 08:25.436
    knows that he's as square   
    a guy as they come.         

08:25.438 --> 08:27.438
            I tell you something
            about Tommy:        

08:27.440 --> 08:28.706
          He used to be in jail.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.941
                  That makes him
                  a square guy? 

08:30.943 --> 08:33.811
            Will you let me     
            finish the story?   

08:33.813 --> 08:35.413
             It so happens      
             the man was framed.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.581
How do you know that?           

08:36.582 --> 08:38.816
        Because he told me that.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.318
Oh, well, then.                 

08:41.321 --> 08:42.919
      Yeah, see how it is       
        talking to you?         

08:42.922 --> 08:44.589
      That's you all over.      

08:44.591 --> 08:46.390
    That's your, what do you    
    call it, attitude, see?     

08:46.392 --> 08:47.558
    You're prejudiced           
     against Tommy Macklin      

08:47.560 --> 08:48.959
        because you know        
    he's a white guy.           

08:48.961 --> 08:50.261
I don't know anything about him.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.663
        I just told you         
      he was a white guy.       

08:52.665 --> 08:53.664
MIKE: So?                       

08:53.666 --> 08:54.665
    That's why you hate him.    

08:54.667 --> 08:56.033
             What?              

08:56.035 --> 08:57.635
    You are prejudiced          
     against white people.      

08:57.637 --> 08:58.636
    Don't tell me no--          

08:58.638 --> 08:59.637
         You're crazy!          

08:59.639 --> 09:01.071
         I ain't crazy!         

09:01.073 --> 09:03.374
If I told you that Tommy Macklin
        was a black guy,        

09:03.376 --> 09:05.009
     you'd be crying tears      
          and saying,           

09:05.011 --> 09:06.910
"Oh, give the poor ex-con       
        a chance."              

09:06.912 --> 09:09.113
 But you know he's a white guy, 
     so you're against him.     

09:09.115 --> 09:10.981
             Well,              
  I ain't prejudiced that way.  

09:12.784 --> 09:14.885
    I ain't prejudiced          
         against no man         

09:14.887 --> 09:18.956
     just because his skin      
  is the same color as my own.  

09:21.226 --> 09:26.364
Yeah, Archie has                
lots of white friends.          

09:26.366 --> 09:29.800
         You're damn right,     
         and I'm gonna get more.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.403
     I'll tell you why          
     I really bought this watch.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.738
        It's because I wanted   
        to show Tommy Macklin   

09:34.740 --> 09:36.240
                that somebody   
                in this world   

09:36.242 --> 09:37.508
                had a little    
                faith in him.   

09:37.510 --> 09:39.177
Oh, sure.                       
                      How sweet.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.578
            Ah, well, I can't   
            talk to you.        

09:40.580 --> 09:41.979
            What the hell       
            am I eating here?   

09:43.148 --> 09:46.016
Yankee stew.                    

09:46.018 --> 09:49.053
            Well, the Yankees   
            struck out.         

09:49.055 --> 09:50.588
            Pass me the ketchup.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.757
            Oh, Daddy, you'd put
            ketchup on a donut. 

09:53.759 --> 09:56.260
                If it needed it.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.595
                  I'll tell you 
                  something else

09:57.597 --> 09:58.663
                 about this here
                 watch, Edith.  

09:58.665 --> 10:00.264
            This is kind of,    
            what do you call,   

10:00.266 --> 10:01.332
                  an investment,
                  you know?     

10:01.334 --> 10:02.533
                  Any time we're
                  short of cash,

10:02.535 --> 10:04.134
                 I can run over 
                 to a hock shop,

10:04.136 --> 10:06.337
         turn this in and get at
         least $150 on it, huh? 

10:06.339 --> 10:08.606
Wouldn't that be                
taking a chance?                
                         Why?   

10:08.608 --> 10:12.142
  Arch, you said so yourself.   
The watch is registered, right? 

10:12.144 --> 10:13.744
         You take that          
      down to a hock shop,      

10:13.746 --> 10:15.145
        that guy checks         
    the serial number           

10:15.147 --> 10:17.081
     against a police list      
        of stolen goods.        

10:17.083 --> 10:18.616
If it's hot, they got you.      

10:18.618 --> 10:23.521
 Look at you, waving that fork  
      around at the table.      

10:23.523 --> 10:25.523
Like I told you a long time ago,

10:25.525 --> 10:28.792
        you are a person        
    of very little quality.     

10:31.796 --> 10:35.666
                    [BUZZING]   

10:35.668 --> 10:37.268
              What are you      
              timing now, Daddy?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.269
         I ain't timing nothing.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.537
                It went on      
                by itself there.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.571
        [BUZZING FADES]         

10:40.573 --> 10:41.972
              Jeez, I wonder why
              it done that.     

10:41.974 --> 10:44.442
          Listen to that.       
          It went off by itself.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.044
     Hey. Don't tell me there's 
     something wrong with it.   

10:47.046 --> 10:49.113
                  Let me listen.
                  Shh. Shush!   

10:51.950 --> 10:54.318
            I don't hear        
            nothing at all here.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.086
          Aw, now, don't tell me

10:56.088 --> 10:58.489
              the watch         
              is busted already.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.291
 Oh, yeah, now we'll never know 

11:00.293 --> 11:02.192
        when the Chinese        
    have finished breakfast.    

11:10.335 --> 11:12.136
I wonder what                   
happened to it.                 

11:12.138 --> 11:13.738
            I think I know      
            what happened to it.

11:13.740 --> 11:14.938
            I had the ketchup   
            up here.            

11:14.940 --> 11:16.540
             I was pounding it  
             here on the bottom.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.742
                 It must have   
                 busted a spring

11:17.744 --> 11:19.243
             or turned something
             loose in there,    

11:19.245 --> 11:20.611
            and, Edith,         
            that's your fault   

11:20.613 --> 11:23.414
            for not loosening up
            that ketchup!       

11:23.416 --> 11:24.448
Oh, I'm sorry,                  
Archie,                         

11:24.450 --> 11:26.751
but it's supposed               
to come out slow.               

11:26.753 --> 11:32.222
It's Heinz, the slowest         
ketchup in the West.            

11:32.224 --> 11:33.791
                Ain't that      
                a shame, now?   

11:33.793 --> 11:35.058
     I just got the watch.      

11:35.060 --> 11:36.260
I hardly start wearing it,      

11:36.262 --> 11:38.462
and now I gotta take it in      
          to be fixed.          

11:38.464 --> 11:40.063
You going to take it            
to a jeweler?                   

11:40.065 --> 11:43.367
No, Meathead, I'm going to take 
it into a garage for a lube job.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.369
      Certainly, I'm going      
  to take it in to a jeweler.   

11:45.371 --> 11:47.705
          Aw, Daddy, I wouldn't 
          do that if I were you,

11:47.707 --> 11:49.407
because if it's stolen,         
you're in trouble.              

11:49.409 --> 11:51.676
        I told you, little girl,
        the watch ain't stolen. 

11:51.678 --> 11:53.444
Yeah, but what if               
the jeweler checks              

11:53.446 --> 11:54.779
the serial number               
with the police                 

11:54.781 --> 11:56.280
and it turns out                
to be stolen?                   

11:56.282 --> 11:58.882
Oh, come on, "turns out to be." 
 Anything could turn out to be. 

11:58.884 --> 12:00.384
    That's what we're trying    
          to tell you.          

12:00.386 --> 12:04.422
      I saw something once      
    about a watch on <i>Mannix.</i>    

12:04.424 --> 12:05.423
                     ARCHIE:    
                     Yeah, what?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.692
  Or was it <i>Let's Make a Deal?</i>  

12:07.694 --> 12:09.460
      Aw, leave me alone,       
        will you?               

12:09.462 --> 12:10.961
          Daddy, if it's stolen,

12:10.963 --> 12:13.497
             what are you going 
             to tell the police?

12:13.499 --> 12:15.399
Well, if it was stolen,         
which it ain't,                 

12:15.401 --> 12:16.801
I would just say                
to the cops--                   

12:16.803 --> 12:17.868
I would say, uh,                

12:17.870 --> 12:19.269
"I bought it                    
off of a guy,                   

12:19.271 --> 12:20.871
and I don't know                
nothing more about it."         

12:20.873 --> 12:23.273
What if the cops find out       
that that guy is Tommy Macklin, 

12:23.275 --> 12:24.475
    they put the heat on him    

12:24.477 --> 12:26.076
          and he says           
 you know everything about it?  

12:26.078 --> 12:28.078
    Then they got you           
 as a receiver of stolen goods. 

12:28.080 --> 12:31.114
                That's right.   

12:31.116 --> 12:34.952
  How come everything you cook  
      gives me heartburn?!      

12:34.954 --> 12:35.953
  Where's the bicarb of soda?   

12:35.955 --> 12:37.321
                Oh, I'll get it 
                for you, Archie.

12:39.157 --> 12:42.192
  Oh, jeez, isn't this awful?   

12:42.194 --> 12:44.362
Archie, you ain't               
really worried                  

12:44.364 --> 12:46.764
about that watch,               
are you?                        

12:46.766 --> 12:49.233
        No, Edith,              
     only that it's broke.      

12:49.235 --> 12:51.268
I mean, you wouldn't            
buy a watch                     

12:51.270 --> 12:52.636
if you knew                     
it was stolen,                  

12:52.638 --> 12:53.771
would you?                      

12:53.773 --> 12:56.640
 You know me better than that,  
             Edith.             

13:00.011 --> 13:02.346
I ain't never                   
heard you talk                  

13:02.348 --> 13:04.782
about Tommy Macklin             
before.                         

13:04.784 --> 13:06.684
Have you known him              
a long time?                    

13:06.686 --> 13:08.919
                 Oh, yeah, yeah,
                 long, long.    

13:08.921 --> 13:10.087
How long?                       

13:10.089 --> 13:11.455
            A week.             

13:25.470 --> 13:26.336
             Edith?             

13:28.740 --> 13:30.107
     You out there, Edith?      

13:34.813 --> 13:37.180
Uh, Gloria, Mike, you upstairs? 

13:54.332 --> 13:56.333
     Uh, hello, Joe Bropy?      

13:56.335 --> 13:57.701
 Uh, my name is Archie Bunker.  

13:57.703 --> 13:59.069
          I'm a friend          
    of Stretch Cunningham's.    

13:59.071 --> 14:01.204
        I work with him.        

14:01.206 --> 14:03.507
  Yeah, yeah, he's a nice guy.  

14:03.509 --> 14:06.944
 Uh, Joe, uh, Stretch tells me  
     that you got a cousin      

14:06.946 --> 14:09.747
      that buys and sells       
    and fixes jewelry           

14:09.749 --> 14:12.116
    with no questions asked.    

14:14.719 --> 14:17.855
          Good. Well,           
 where can I get ahold of him?  

14:17.857 --> 14:20.457
              Huh?              

14:20.459 --> 14:22.225
    Oh, yeah? For how long?     

14:28.266 --> 14:29.900
            No, no,             
  I got to get somebody fast.   

14:29.902 --> 14:32.036
    I can't wait 1 to 10.       

14:32.038 --> 14:33.037
              Bye.              

14:33.039 --> 14:34.905
                [DOORBELL RINGS]

14:38.609 --> 14:40.110
                 Hi, Mr. Bunker.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.511
Oh, hiya, Lionel,               
come on in.                     

14:41.513 --> 14:42.512

                     cleaning.  

14:42.514 --> 14:44.114
            Uh, do me a favor   
            and stick it        

14:44.116 --> 14:45.315
                in the closet   
                there, will you?

14:45.317 --> 14:46.316
Is Mrs. Bunker                  
around?                         

14:46.318 --> 14:47.785
She usually pays me             
on Friday nights.               

14:47.787 --> 14:49.019
            Oh, no, she's out   
            somewhere,          

14:49.021 --> 14:50.420
             but she'll catch up
             with you, Lionel.  

14:50.422 --> 14:51.421
         Okay. See you.         

14:51.423 --> 14:53.090
Lionel, as long                 
as you're here,                 

14:53.092 --> 14:54.491
there's something               
I'd like to ask you.            

14:54.493 --> 14:55.592
                    Yeah?       

14:55.594 --> 14:57.327
Yeah, it's something            
that I've been                  

14:57.329 --> 14:58.328
wondering about                 
for a while.                    

14:58.330 --> 15:00.197
                     Uh-huh.    

15:02.967 --> 15:07.104
Lionel, uh,                     
you know them riots             

15:07.106 --> 15:08.839
youse people                    
are always going to?            

15:08.841 --> 15:11.075
                  We people?    

15:11.077 --> 15:12.542
I don't mean you                
personally,                     

15:12.544 --> 15:14.377
I mean, you know,               
the troublemakers.              

15:14.379 --> 15:15.445
          Oh, them other people.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.914
Yeah, yeah, yeah.               

15:16.916 --> 15:19.549
Now, when they go               
to these here riots,            

15:19.551 --> 15:21.251
don't they, uh,                 
every now and then              

15:21.253 --> 15:22.586
break into jewelry stores?      

15:22.588 --> 15:23.987
                Oh, yeah, yeah. 

15:23.989 --> 15:27.191
        They don't want         
        nobody to feel left out.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.892
Yeah. Well...                   

15:28.894 --> 15:31.028
A guy busts                     
into a jewelry store there,     

15:31.030 --> 15:32.629
and he whips a watch,           
see, and then,                  

15:32.631 --> 15:35.933
in all the excitement           
of, uh, running away, uh,       

15:35.935 --> 15:37.267
the watch gets damaged.         

15:37.269 --> 15:38.535
Like, for instance,             

15:38.537 --> 15:40.537
if a cop comes up               
and he's got a club,            

15:40.539 --> 15:42.339
and he takes a swing            
at the guy's head               

15:42.341 --> 15:44.208
and by accident                 
he hits the watch.              

15:44.210 --> 15:45.575
You can see                     
that happening?                 

15:45.577 --> 15:46.710
                Oh, sure, yeah. 

15:46.712 --> 15:48.812
         That's what gives riots
         a bad name.            

15:50.749 --> 15:52.950
Look, please, sit down.         

15:52.952 --> 15:56.186
Suppose a guy has got           
that kind of a watch, see?      

15:56.188 --> 15:57.221
It's damaged.                   

15:57.223 --> 15:58.989
     Now, where would he go     

15:58.991 --> 16:01.959
          to get it fixed, like,
          uh, on the q.t.?      

16:01.961 --> 16:03.794
Oh, well, I wouldn't know       
about them places.              

16:03.796 --> 16:06.063
    Lionel, I don't mean you.   

16:06.065 --> 16:08.665
     I thought maybe you had    
     some friend who might know.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.700
No, my friends don't fool       
with small stuff.               

16:10.702 --> 16:12.002
They're more into               
air conditioners,               

16:12.004 --> 16:14.872
TV sets, stereos.               

16:14.874 --> 16:16.907
                 Never a watch? 

16:16.909 --> 16:21.011
No, but if you want to put in   
a order for the next riot...    

16:21.013 --> 16:24.514
      Lionel, Lionel,           
      be serious here, will you?

16:24.516 --> 16:27.284
 It so happens                  
 I got a very close friend, see?

16:27.286 --> 16:29.920
        And he just got ahold   
        of this expensive watch.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.121
He got it in a riot?            

16:31.123 --> 16:32.856
No, no, no. He's a white guy.   

16:32.858 --> 16:33.723
Oh.                             

16:38.062 --> 16:40.597
     He got ahold of this watch,
     like, just yesterday,      

16:40.599 --> 16:41.598
             and now it's broke.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.233
     And I want to know, I mean,

16:43.235 --> 16:45.035
     where could he get it fixed
     off the record?            

16:45.037 --> 16:46.503
Why don't he ask the police?    

16:46.505 --> 16:48.605
        No, no, got to keep     
        the cops out of this.   

16:48.607 --> 16:50.073
              Why?              

16:50.075 --> 16:52.409
  From what I've been reading,  
the cops got great connections. 

16:53.678 --> 16:55.112
 Now, hold it, Lionel, hold it. 

16:55.114 --> 16:56.914
         I think I know         
 what you're getting at there.  

16:56.916 --> 16:59.516
 Now, that ain't exactly fair.  

16:59.518 --> 17:02.186
      We all know there's       
 a couple of cops on the take.  

17:02.188 --> 17:04.188
  You don't want to go blaming  
  the whole police department   

17:04.190 --> 17:05.622
 for a couple of rotten apples. 

17:05.624 --> 17:07.723
              Oh!               

17:07.726 --> 17:09.392
 So-- So what you're saying is, 

17:09.394 --> 17:11.661
         don't condemn          
    a whole group of people     

17:11.663 --> 17:14.263
for the actions of a few?       

17:14.266 --> 17:16.633
     That's right, Lionel.      
    You gotta remember that.    

17:16.635 --> 17:19.303
Oh, I will. I will, Mr. Bunker. 

17:19.305 --> 17:21.137
Uh, uh, let me see now.         

17:21.140 --> 17:22.571
     "Don't condemn a whole     
        group of people         

17:22.574 --> 17:24.074
                 for the actions
                 of just a few."

17:24.076 --> 17:26.108
Yeah, you got it, Lionel.       
What about the watch?           

17:26.111 --> 17:27.911
                      Oh, hello,
                      Lionel.   

17:27.913 --> 17:29.112
              Hi.               

17:29.114 --> 17:31.882
I'm glad I caught you,          
because I want to pay you.      

17:31.884 --> 17:33.717
How much                        
do I owe you?                   

17:33.719 --> 17:34.751
    Five dollars even.          

17:34.753 --> 17:36.920
Oh, here you are,               
and thanks.                     

17:36.922 --> 17:38.922
Oh, Archie, here's the          
ticket for your watch.          

17:38.924 --> 17:40.023
             What?              

17:40.025 --> 17:42.192
Your round-the-world watch.     

17:42.194 --> 17:44.328
It'll be ready                  
in a few days.                  

17:44.330 --> 17:45.595
        What did you do with it?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.497
Why, I took it                  
to Abrams Jewelers.             

17:47.499 --> 17:48.598
            Why did you do that?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.167
You said                        
you wanted it fixed.            

17:50.169 --> 17:51.801
ARCHIE:                         
Oh, Edith!                      

17:53.738 --> 17:55.138
Ain't that a coincidence,       
          Mr. Bunker?           

17:55.140 --> 17:57.274
  Your friend broke his watch   
     the same time you did.     

18:01.246 --> 18:02.445
      I'll see you around,      
          huh, Lionel?          

18:02.447 --> 18:03.480
Bye, Lionel.                    

18:03.482 --> 18:04.614
            Bye, Mrs. Bunker.   

18:04.616 --> 18:06.216
        Wait, how did that go   
        again, Mr. Bunker?      

18:06.218 --> 18:07.217
              Uh, "don't condemn

18:07.219 --> 18:08.218
                  "a whole group
                  of people     

18:08.220 --> 18:09.686
                 for the actions
                 of a few."     

18:09.688 --> 18:10.687
Yeah, you got it.               

18:10.689 --> 18:11.821
                 Yeah, I got it.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.690
     "Don't condemn a whole     
        group of people         

18:13.692 --> 18:15.392
for the actions of a few."      

18:15.394 --> 18:16.693
        "Don't condemn..."      

18:20.831 --> 18:22.232
        Edith, why did--?       

18:22.234 --> 18:23.633
         Edith, Edith,          
    where the hell are you?     

18:23.635 --> 18:24.634
EDITH:                          
In the kitchen!                 

18:24.636 --> 18:25.903
Where was you two?              

18:25.905 --> 18:27.337
        Upstairs.               

18:27.339 --> 18:29.273
     Why didn't you answer      
      when I called youse?      

18:29.275 --> 18:31.441
             We didn't hear you.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.048
Edith, Edith,                   
do you know                     

18:38.050 --> 18:39.249
what you done to me?            

18:39.251 --> 18:41.118
Why did you take                
that watch into Abrams'?        

18:41.120 --> 18:43.253
        Well, I could have      
        taken it to Nelson's,   

18:43.255 --> 18:45.455
        but Mrs. Abrams and I   
        have gotten to be       

18:45.457 --> 18:46.456
              such good friends.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.358
That ain't the point!           

18:48.360 --> 18:49.859
Edith,                          
Abrams had the watch all day!   

18:49.861 --> 18:51.128
He could have opened it up,     

18:51.130 --> 18:52.930
seen the serial number there    
and called the cops.            

18:52.932 --> 18:54.932
They could be on their way      
over here right now.            

18:54.934 --> 18:56.866
    Oh, no, I don't think so.   

18:56.868 --> 18:59.469
  I don't think he's even looked
  at the watch yet.             

18:59.471 --> 19:00.938
Why not?                        

19:00.940 --> 19:02.839
    Because I just took it in   
    10 minutes ago.             

19:02.841 --> 19:04.975
10 minutes ago?                 

19:04.977 --> 19:05.976
                    Yeah.       

19:05.978 --> 19:07.077
Oh, Edith,                      
I love you!                     

19:07.079 --> 19:08.445
          Oh, Archie!           

19:08.447 --> 19:09.512
Get away from me!               

19:11.149 --> 19:12.549
Mike, Mike!                     

19:12.551 --> 19:13.550
Yeah?                           

19:13.552 --> 19:14.751
                     Where'd you
                     come from? 

19:14.753 --> 19:15.852
Uh, the stork brought me.       

19:15.854 --> 19:17.054
        Ah, don't be a wise guy!

19:17.056 --> 19:18.888
                  Get over here!

19:18.890 --> 19:20.223
Get your coat on!               
                    What for?   

19:20.225 --> 19:21.624
 Get your coat on.              
                     What for?  

19:21.626 --> 19:24.328
Get your coat on,               
get your coat on.               

19:24.330 --> 19:25.662
Get your coat on!               

19:25.664 --> 19:27.264
            Okay! I'm getting   
            it on!              

19:27.266 --> 19:28.432
                What's going on?

19:28.434 --> 19:31.301
Archie said                     
he loved me!                    

19:31.303 --> 19:33.170
        All right,              
what do you want me to do?      

19:33.172 --> 19:34.972
I want you to go                
down to Abrams Jewelry.         

19:34.974 --> 19:36.573
Your mother-in-law              
took that watch in by mistake.  

19:36.575 --> 19:39.242
I want you to get it back before
he sees the serial number.      

19:39.244 --> 19:40.643
    Why? You afraid it's stolen?

19:40.645 --> 19:42.879
No, I ain't afraid it's stolen! 

19:42.881 --> 19:44.281
It happens to be                
a beautiful watch.              

19:44.283 --> 19:46.016
I don't want                    
no neighborhood amateur         

19:46.018 --> 19:47.117
messing around with it, see?    

19:47.119 --> 19:48.718
So hurry up down there          
and get it.                     

19:48.720 --> 19:50.087
Will you move?                  
                      I'm going.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.888
Can you move                    
faster?                         
                 Leave me alone,
                 will you?      

19:51.890 --> 19:53.090
Can you                         
get going?                      
                      I'm going!

19:53.092 --> 19:55.292
What if he already checked      
          the number?           

19:55.294 --> 19:57.560
    Wait. Get back in here.     

19:57.562 --> 19:58.561
                        What?   

19:58.563 --> 20:00.063
Get back in here.               
                        Archie--

20:00.065 --> 20:01.931
Get back in here!               
                        Come on!

20:01.933 --> 20:03.266
        All right, all right!   

20:03.268 --> 20:05.268
I'm back in here,               
now what?                       

20:05.270 --> 20:06.669
              Shut up. I'm going
              to call Abrams.   

20:06.671 --> 20:08.571
            I'm going to get    
            him on the phone.   

20:08.573 --> 20:09.806
        It's going to be faster.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.208
        Gloria, look up         
 Mr. Abrams' telephone number.  

20:11.210 --> 20:13.143
The number's                    
on the ticket.                  

20:13.145 --> 20:14.144
        Get the ticket.         

20:14.146 --> 20:15.145
    Where's the phone book?     

20:15.147 --> 20:16.279
Get her the phone book.         

20:16.281 --> 20:17.614
            Call information.   
Call information.               

20:17.616 --> 20:18.948
    I got the ticket!           

20:18.950 --> 20:20.384
             Give me the ticket.
I'm getting information.        

20:20.386 --> 20:21.918
        She's got the ticket.   
I got information.              

20:21.920 --> 20:22.952
                We don't need   
                information.    

20:22.954 --> 20:24.287
Hello, Abrams Jewelry           
Store, please.                  

20:24.289 --> 20:25.889
              Give me the phone.
              Give me the phone.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.956
Daddy, you just                 
told me--                       

20:26.958 --> 20:28.558
              We got the ticket!
              Give me the phone.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.360
Information, we don't need you. 
    We got the ticket.          

20:30.362 --> 20:32.496
    Get off the line.           
        I got to use it!        

20:35.633 --> 20:36.966
              Will you get      
              away from here    

20:36.968 --> 20:38.301
                 and let her    
                 in there?      

20:38.303 --> 20:39.936
             Give me the ticket.
             Get out of here!   

20:39.938 --> 20:42.005
         Read that ticket to me.

20:42.007 --> 20:45.375
        Oh, "Abrams Jewelers,

It ain't after 6:00.

     to talk to you about.

          Mr. Bunker.           

21:32.757 --> 21:35.225
Don't tell me no bad news.      

21:35.227 --> 21:36.859
Let me tell you, first of all,  

21:36.861 --> 21:38.595
I don't know nothing            
about that watch.               

21:38.597 --> 21:39.596
            I know.             

21:39.598 --> 21:40.997
 That's why I came to tell you  

21:40.999 --> 21:43.700
  that it's going to cost you   
         $21 to fix it.         

21:43.702 --> 21:46.035
That's what you come over       
to tell me?                     

21:46.037 --> 21:48.438
Jeez, I thought you were going  
to come over and tell me        

21:48.440 --> 21:50.340
that maybe the watch            
was stolen or something.        

21:50.342 --> 21:52.976
          This watch?           
      No, absolutely not.       

21:52.978 --> 21:54.911
Well, that's good news,         
Mr. Abrams!

You're wrong again.

Mr. Abrams, you have            
my authoritization              

22:05.357 --> 22:07.690
to go ahead and fix the watch.  

22:07.692 --> 22:09.826
    Are you sure, Mr. Bunker?   

22:09.828 --> 22:13.630
  $21 is a lot of money to spend
  to fix an $8 watch.           

22:19.970 --> 22:22.506
What do you mean?               
That's a $300 Omega.            

22:22.508 --> 22:26.610
     This is not an Omega.      
         It is "Onega."

            the expensive watch.

             I hate to admit it,

  as two weeks' take-home pay.

            that, Daddy?        

23:07.452 --> 23:08.718
    Figure it out yourself.

Two weeks' take-home pay,       
          that's $300.          

23:10.189 --> 23:13.523

on an $8 watch.

    You spend the $21,          
    you get the watch fixed.

    You've already spent 25,

 you got your $300 watch back.
