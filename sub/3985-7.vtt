01:14.474 --> 01:16.465
They got
Honey Nut Cheerios in here?

01:16.509 --> 01:17.737
Shit.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.488
Yo, back the fuck up,
motherfucker!

01:29.522 --> 01:31.615
My man here
saved my spot, yo.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.495
It's a shame we don't have
more time together.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.696
We could have made us
a couple of babies.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.493
Ain't nobody see shit.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.300
- How's that for a message?
- Not bad.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.965
Except the price
on your head ain't for four figures...

02:20.006 --> 02:21.735
- it's for five.
- Shit. For that kind of money,

02:21.774 --> 02:23.366
I should have done you
my own self.

02:23.409 --> 02:25.468
So who's doing
the bounty?

02:25.512 --> 02:27.639
Who it is: A West Side player
by the name of Marlo.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.148
Marlo? Can't say
I know the man.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.346
- He know you.
- Can you get me a phone call?

02:33.386 --> 02:35.149
I can do you one
better than that.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.990
Who you calling?

02:42.028 --> 02:44.519
- Police.
- The police?

02:44.564 --> 02:47.397
Man owe me a favor.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.734
...crime, violence, drugs,

04:37.777 --> 04:40.644
drug addiction,
failing schools...

04:40.680 --> 04:43.547
all of these social problems
in Baltimore City

04:43.583 --> 04:45.312
over and over again.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.319
And on June 8th,

04:47.353 --> 04:49.480
when I had to write
a column for the next day,

04:49.522 --> 04:52.389
some statistics had just come out
from the FBI showing

04:52.425 --> 04:54.484
an uptick in some
of Baltimore's crime.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.995
And we also had
a spate of five killings

04:57.030 --> 04:59.191
in a two-
or three-day period.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.258
And, you know, the idea
of sitting down again

05:02.302 --> 05:04.930
and writing another column
on this subject...

05:04.971 --> 05:06.598
I don't know
if it is important.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.766
But here I am
a citizen of Baltimore,

05:08.808 --> 05:12.608
and I take my citizenship as seriously
as I take my credentials as a columnist.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.274
I said, "What am I gonna say?
What can I say about this?"

05:16.316 --> 05:17.943
If the killings continue...

05:17.984 --> 05:21.351
between 250 and 300
homicides a year...

05:21.387 --> 05:24.356
- Top of the world.
- Top of the world.

05:24.390 --> 05:27.120
I knocked off an incumbent major, Tony.
That ain't easy.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.458
National party has to
take note of this.

05:29.495 --> 05:33.226
Young and pretty as you are,
I'm sure they've got ideas.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.326
All you have to do now
is run the city.

05:36.369 --> 05:39.133
Tony, I've got to ask
you something:

05:39.172 --> 05:41.299
Why didn't you run again
after the first term?

05:41.341 --> 05:45.141
I mean, nobody had the...
the name you had, the organization.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.976
Let me tell you
a story, Tommy.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.882
The first day I became mayor,
they sit me down at the desk...

05:51.918 --> 05:54.819
big chair and dark wood,

05:54.854 --> 05:57.322
lots of beautiful things.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.225
I'm thinking,
"How much better can it get?"

06:01.260 --> 06:04.161
There's a knock at the door
in the corner of the room,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.324
and Pete comes walking in

06:06.366 --> 06:08.698
carrying this gorgeous

06:08.735 --> 06:12.330
SÃ¨vres silver bowl,
hand chased.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.203
It was this big.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.538
"It's from the unions,"
he says.

06:16.576 --> 06:17.838
So I think
it's a present,

06:17.877 --> 06:21.210
something to commemorate
my first day as mayor.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.807
And he walks over,
puts it on a desk.

06:23.850 --> 06:27.081
I look down at it.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.485
It's disgusting.

06:28.521 --> 06:31.684
I said, "What the hell is this?"

06:31.724 --> 06:33.851
He said,
"What the hell's it look like?"

06:33.893 --> 06:37.693
I said,
"It looks like shit.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.664
Well, what do you want me
to do with it?"

06:39.699 --> 06:43.135
He says, "Eat it."

06:43.169 --> 06:44.227
"Eat it?"

06:44.270 --> 06:45.567
He says, "Yeah.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.163
You're the mayor.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.367
You've got to eat it."

06:49.409 --> 06:50.740
So, okay.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.746
It was my first day,
and Pete knows more than I do.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.145
So I go at it.

06:55.181 --> 06:59.481
And just when I finish,
there's a knock on the door.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.977
And in walks Pete carrying
another silver bowl,

07:03.022 --> 07:04.580
and this one's
from the blacks.

07:04.624 --> 07:05.818
"This too?"

07:05.858 --> 07:08.520
And he nods. I start eating.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.085
And when I'm finished,

07:10.129 --> 07:12.791
there's another knock
and another bowl.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.595
This one's
from the Polacks.

07:14.634 --> 07:18.229
Then after that,
one from the ministers.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.738
And you know what, Tommy?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.330
That's what it is.

07:21.374 --> 07:25.105
You're sitting, eating shit
all day long, day after day,

07:25.144 --> 07:26.702
year after year.

07:26.746 --> 07:27.838
When I realized that,

07:27.880 --> 07:31.247
I decided being
a downtown lawyer

07:31.284 --> 07:36.244
and seeing my family
every night made for a fine life.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.156
Just a fine life.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.285
Got that dark horse
right here, man.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.386
O.G. Dark horse.

07:48.668 --> 07:51.466
Man, everyone knows
his nigga ain't about to cop, is he?

07:52.738 --> 07:56.367
Spider, Spider,
hold on now.

07:56.409 --> 08:00.038
Come on, man.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.206
Why you ain't come past
my gym no more?

08:02.248 --> 08:04.443
I been waiting on you
for weeks now.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.748
Talk to me, son.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.777
You ain't my fuckin' father.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.315
What happened between
me and your mom

08:13.359 --> 08:16.089
ain't got shit to do with you
taking advantage of the gym.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.927
Now, man, I'm just saying
you one of my best, boy.

08:20.967 --> 08:23.435
Hell, if I thought it
was gonna hurt you, I wouldn't...

08:23.469 --> 08:25.437
Fuck you! Ain't nobody
gonna hurt me.

08:25.471 --> 08:28.907
Fuck you. So step up
and step off, unc.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.136
I got customers
backing up.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.472
Dark horse,
dark horse.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.808
Five, and five more.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.288
Shit. That's what that does.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.759
Principal Withers,
please to the cafeteria.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.124
Yo, last card down.
Remember?

08:49.161 --> 08:50.389
Oh yeah.
My bad.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.326
Hey, guys.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.033
You know I don't mind you
coming up here most days

09:01.073 --> 09:04.565
to eat lunch, but I said
you can't be gambling.

09:04.610 --> 09:08.637
Yo, Mr. Prezbo, the quarter's
only a, you know, reminder

09:08.681 --> 09:10.876
to remind me
that I got 25 shells.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.613
That's all. Come on,
let's see what you've got.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.520
Dang. Flush.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.751
- But it don't beat your three nines.
- Yeah, it do.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.055
- It do?
- It do.

09:21.093 --> 09:23.027
It does.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.828
Karim, you should have been more
cautious with your bet. Figure the odds.

09:26.866 --> 09:29.198
Yo, it's our lunch break.
Don't be schooling us now.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.793
Hold on.
Let him talk.

09:30.836 --> 09:34.772
Well, for starters,
you have to get a count on the diamonds.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.275
You know how many diamonds
there are in a deck?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.470
13.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.810
13... that's right. Cards is
all about knowing the numbers.

09:41.847 --> 09:44.111
With the numbers,
you can calculate the odds.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.675
Now, Michael had
four diamonds showing.

09:46.719 --> 09:47.743
Hold on. Wait.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.118
What about dice?

09:49.155 --> 09:51.680
I mean, does dice
have odds too?

09:51.724 --> 09:54.352
'Cause mostly
that's what we play.

09:54.393 --> 09:57.123
- Dice?
- Yeah. Sure.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.688
So, can you show us
the odds of dice?

09:59.732 --> 10:02.292
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, man. Teach us dice.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.962
- That'd be hard, man.
- For real.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.870
Here comes that
Jailhouse Rick.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.464
The Braddock case?

10:08.507 --> 10:12.136
I take it we now have permission
to solve this fucking case,

10:12.178 --> 10:14.476
seeing as everyone's
finished voting.

10:14.513 --> 10:17.175
Solve away,
you bold centurions.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.117
You don't have
work to do?

10:28.260 --> 10:31.661
Not till I catch
a fresh call, no.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.688
How much can you
sell that one for?

10:33.733 --> 10:37.260
Mint condition, 300.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.362
Fuck me.
I need a hobby.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.204
That's right,

10:43.242 --> 10:44.903
but he bucked on me.

10:44.944 --> 10:48.607
I just thought he might have
come back past once or twice.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.673
Sherrod's on a truant list,
Mr. Cousins.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.150
He hasn't been back since
the last time you brought him in.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.112
Well, if he does
come back past,

10:57.156 --> 10:59.283
can you tell him
I'm looking for him at home,

10:59.325 --> 11:00.917
and he can come
home if he want?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.990
I apologize
for taking your time.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.865
I see you up here undercover.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.392
All right.
Don't worry, dawg.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.995
I'll keep it close.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.339
Mrs. Donnelly?
Does the school have

11:20.379 --> 11:22.313
any kind of collection
of board games...

11:22.348 --> 11:24.646
Parcheesi,
Trouble, Monopoly?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.982
You're still teaching
eighth-grade math, right?

11:27.019 --> 11:28.850
Trying. Yeah.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.492
The book room downstairs.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.828
Stay on the curriculum,
Mr. Pryzbylewski,

11:39.865 --> 11:43.392
or you'll have an area superintendent
on our backs.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.461
Remember this, yo?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.375
Not in my case.

11:50.409 --> 11:54.311
Them boys working the case
ain't really in the mood to listen.

11:54.346 --> 11:57.213
As you can see, I still got
the lady-lawyer marker,

11:57.249 --> 12:00.776
and if I recall, a police gun
got fired a while back.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.913
Only reason I'm even here
is because of that gun.

12:02.955 --> 12:05.185
As far as llene Nathan goes,

12:05.224 --> 12:09.627
she promised a get-out-of-jail-free
on a small felony or two.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.758
This here is a taxpayer murder
with an eyeball witness.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.131
The eyeball witness
is lying, yo. Come on now.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.295
When have you ever known me
to put my gun on anybody

12:18.337 --> 12:20.328
- that wasn't in the gang?
- Oh. Omar.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.237
Old Face Andre is
lying on me here.

12:22.274 --> 12:24.299
The store owner...
now why would he lie?

12:24.343 --> 12:27.312
- Andre working a package out the store.
- Ah.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.644
Folk like that, they tend to bear
a certain resentment

12:29.682 --> 12:30.944
toward folk like me.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.213
If you didn't do this,
when you did others...

12:33.252 --> 12:37.621
shit, I got files
on two open doubles last year.

12:37.656 --> 12:40.454
Shotgun shells
at both scenes.

12:42.628 --> 12:46.792
- What about that stash-house gunfight?
- Hmm?

12:46.832 --> 12:50.233
What about Stringer Bell
and his muscle dead in the warehouse?

12:50.269 --> 12:53.705
If this one ain't on you,
another dozen probably are.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.764
And if this one
goes to court,

12:55.808 --> 12:58.003
you can tell that jury
how wrong it is.

13:01.046 --> 13:04.311
Obviously, a guy's alone
before I swear to them on the stand.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.518
You leave me at courtside
and I'm done.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.078
- You know that.
- Yeah?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.953
So you ain't
making friends.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.652
I got a bounty
on my head, man...

13:13.692 --> 13:15.319
five figures.

13:19.498 --> 13:22.626
If I would have known I'd be
sharing quarters with all these boys,

13:22.668 --> 13:26.001
I probably wouldn't
have robbed so many of them.

13:26.038 --> 13:29.530
Aw yeah,
that golden rule.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.841
Well, since you
feeling all Biblical

13:32.878 --> 13:34.971
and righteous and all,
you think on this:

13:35.014 --> 13:38.142
Now if Omar ain't killed
that delivery lady, somebody else did.

13:38.184 --> 13:42.644
But you giving him a free walk
right now, though, ain't you?

13:42.688 --> 13:45.623
A man got
to have a code.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.510
What's up?

14:13.552 --> 14:15.452
Just the dice.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.819
Grab the dice
from any game that has them.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.992
We're using
that third edition, right?

14:32.037 --> 14:35.131
- I don't know.
- We're using the third.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.142
What are the new
fifth editions doing

14:37.176 --> 14:38.837
sitting down here in a box?

15:07.473 --> 15:10.237
No way.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.210
Big red, y'all.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.075
Big reds over here.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.418
What's up, man?

15:23.455 --> 15:24.820
Got your big yellow.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.121
What's up?

15:27.159 --> 15:28.854
Big yellow for you.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.153
Look at you,
all business and shit.

15:33.832 --> 15:35.766
Big yellow bird.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.996
Yo, who you bumping with?

15:39.038 --> 15:40.665
Ain't no bump.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.537
They got their corner,
I got mine.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.804
Ain't no thing.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.538
You going up
the gym today?

15:46.578 --> 15:49.979
I might see you later.

15:50.015 --> 15:53.143
Big yellow.
Big yellow birds over here.

15:53.185 --> 15:56.211
- Well, maybe they with Marlo.
- Ain't with no one.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.587
They're just young'uns
playing in this shit.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.182
So what you want to do?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.557
Don't want to mix here
and bring the police to our shop.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.425
When they step off,
you follow.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.261
- Bank 'em good.
- What if they strut?

16:07.299 --> 16:09.767
Yellow, big yellow.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.599
Ain't no need
to pop no one,

16:11.637 --> 16:12.763
but they need a warning.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.773
Make sure they know
we for real.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.640
Brokeback, man.
Brokeback right here.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.439
Fresh from the street.
Brokeback.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.105
Brokeback.
Brokeback.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.340
Big yellow bird.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.179
Tried to bring out
who was on me.

16:25.217 --> 16:28.277
Led him
to the train station.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.414
How that work?

16:31.457 --> 16:34.949
Had the railroad police on me.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.953
Couldn't smoke.
Guy was pulling the strings.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.989
You need a name.

16:41.033 --> 16:45.493
You get that,
I can run it down for you.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.733
I'll get a name.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.469
Camera still there?

16:52.177 --> 16:54.304
Steal that motherfucker.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.314
No one speaks to it,

16:56.348 --> 16:58.145
then it's the feds
sniffing you out.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.947
It's only federals who'd be
rich enough to lose a camera

17:00.986 --> 17:02.749
and not go
to crying about it.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.984
You steal that bitch
and someone comes knocking,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.255
it's local.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.255
Steal that bitch.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.287
See what comes.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.960
Hey, you know the boy used to be
with me running these carts,

17:19.003 --> 17:20.631
go by the name
of Sherrod?

17:20.672 --> 17:23.232
I'm looking for him.
I've got some good news.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.835
So if you spot him,
you know, tell him to come see me.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.780
That's $9 for two,
$10 for three.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.680
That's $10 even too.
That's a good product.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.150
Ain't none
of that alley shit.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.847
People walking in front
of the camera waving... waving hello.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.412
Them Chinese made that shit.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.788
- Yeah.
- No?

17:39.825 --> 17:41.816
Hey, bro.
Much obliged.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.623
It's a good deal,
good deal.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.857
Hey, remember
to holler at my boy if you see him.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.297
All right.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.630
All right, here we go!

17:49.668 --> 17:52.637
Bubbles' Depot
for my people.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.536
Bubbles'll take care
of your troubles.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.835
Ain't no trouble yet.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.508
All right.
All right.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.671
Take it easy, okay?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.976
I know you remember me.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.607
All right,
be cool with it.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.345
Give it up, nigga...

18:06.385 --> 18:08.376
that's what I'm gonna say to you
every time we meet.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.650
Money or pills,
don't care which.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.251
All right,
all right. Cool.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.783
I'm getting it.

18:17.963 --> 18:20.454
See?

18:23.635 --> 18:25.967
Back down, yo.
He's in a hole.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.781
Motherfucker
bad for business, man.

18:39.818 --> 18:42.343
Y'all don't take care of
your neighborhood store?

18:49.661 --> 18:51.652
What's up?

18:54.500 --> 18:55.797
Officer.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.326
How you doing, Officer?

18:59.371 --> 19:00.633
Can you help me out please?

19:00.672 --> 19:01.832
I just got robbed.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.206
Thank you, man.
They all saw it.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.404
Everybody was here
witnessing everything.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.569
Took your money?

19:09.615 --> 19:11.344
Yeah, man.
Same guy every day.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.647
He went down the alley
towards Payson Street.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.380
You can cut him off
on Lafayette...

19:15.420 --> 19:18.912
You can't sell on the street
without a license.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.518
And these movies...
it's copyright infringement.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.621
- Come on, man.
- That's a hefty fine.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.294
That's my 10...

19:35.040 --> 19:36.598
Are you gonna rob me too?

19:36.642 --> 19:38.269
That's what
you're gonna do?

19:38.310 --> 19:39.834
You rob me also?

19:39.878 --> 19:42.608
Baltimore's finest right here.
Thank you.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.651
Everybody gather up,

19:53.692 --> 19:55.956
all right?

19:55.994 --> 19:58.827
Everybody take five
and gather up.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.436
Mike, get in here too.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.504
I want everybody that uses
the gym to hear this now.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.287
Most of y'all know I came home

20:22.321 --> 20:25.222
after being in a long time.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.691
And some of y'all... shit,

20:27.726 --> 20:30.354
all of y'all probably
seen me welcoming the attentions

20:30.395 --> 20:32.989
of some of the ladies
who've come past.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.830
Easy.

20:36.868 --> 20:41.828
Now, I realize that some
of these ladies is your relations.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.841
I ain't mean
to disrespect y'all

20:43.875 --> 20:46.810
or have any feelings hurt.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.610
All y'all come in here
to learn a sport

20:50.649 --> 20:52.583
and better yourselves.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.815
Ain't no need for me
to get in the way of that.

20:59.057 --> 21:00.718
All right.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.691
And if your witness is in the game,
and Omar jacked him up good...

21:09.735 --> 21:11.794
- What the fuck is this?
- Hey, Crutch, I'm just asking.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.304
Is he kin
to you or what?

21:13.338 --> 21:15.499
Vernon, man, you ran the sheet
on that Old Face, right?

21:15.540 --> 21:17.337
Yeah. He was an asshole.
So what?

21:17.376 --> 21:19.003
So what?
What's the history?

21:19.044 --> 21:21.478
Do we come behind your casework
talking this kind of shit?

21:21.513 --> 21:22.639
- Aw.
- Do we?

21:22.681 --> 21:24.615
- Come on.
- No. Fuck you, Bunk.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.448
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.995
Soon as he comes out the gym,
yo, bank his ass, man.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.527
Make sure
that nigga's shook.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.169
You thought
I wouldn't handle it.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.678
Some of us are in need
of some reproof.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.681
I don't know about
all this beefin', man.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.205
What, you scared, nigga?

22:00.385 --> 22:02.478
We need to pump
your ass up some more.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.828
Game on.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.141
You coming round
the way tomorrow?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.147
I think you should
stay off that spot.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.773
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

22:30.816 --> 22:32.477
Man, fuck you.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.950
Fuck!

22:37.856 --> 22:40.120
Mouthing don't
work for you, nigga.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.593
Whoa whoa whoa.

22:43.628 --> 22:46.688
Y'all have got to take this shit
out of the front of my door.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.195
Namond, go inside.

22:54.239 --> 22:55.501
Man, fuck you!

22:55.540 --> 22:57.007
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.304
Hey, I feel you, man.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.640
Ain't no beef here, though,

22:59.678 --> 23:01.202
all right?

23:04.816 --> 23:06.647
Go inside, man.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.087
Yo, what happened
to your boy?

23:14.126 --> 23:16.287
What the fuck
happened to you?

23:16.328 --> 23:17.454
Ain't nothing.

23:17.496 --> 23:19.293
You need to see how
the other nigga look.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.593
- Who was that?
- Ain't nothing.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.122
I can handle that fool.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.135
- You ain't have to step too.
- Aw shit, no!

23:24.169 --> 23:26.763
You had everything under control.
Look at your face!

23:26.805 --> 23:29.638
Course, I recognize the other boy
was high as all hell.

23:29.674 --> 23:32.142
And anything can jump off
when it's like that, you know.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.509
Yeah, and he'd have been
on his ass if you ain't mixed in.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.682
What's going on?

23:44.723 --> 23:46.816
He into something?

23:46.858 --> 23:48.291
Ain't none of my business.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.191
Yours either.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.764
Seriously, you guys ran
a hell of a campaign...

23:59.805 --> 24:01.170
no let-up,
a lot of heart.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.367
- I'll second that.
- Yeah. I liked the shit

24:03.408 --> 24:05.968
when you trotted out
that witness story during the debate.

24:06.011 --> 24:07.808
What about the fucking
last-minute fliers

24:07.846 --> 24:09.438
and me and the slum lord
doing a tango

24:09.481 --> 24:10.743
on the courthouse steps?

24:10.782 --> 24:12.113
Wait.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.277
Parker, who was behind that?

24:14.319 --> 24:16.617
I didn't see
no Royce authority line.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.213
Well?

24:23.395 --> 24:26.421
Tommy, enough of
the bullshit, hmm?

24:26.465 --> 24:28.228
What the hell
are we waiting for?

24:28.266 --> 24:31.497
Bring your ass around here
and try out the big chair.

24:31.536 --> 24:34.664
Come on.
Come on around here.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.230
I'm not even Mayor-Elect.

24:36.274 --> 24:38.299
General election's still
a few weeks away.

24:38.343 --> 24:41.107
You don't beat Crawford
in a city where we outnumber

24:41.146 --> 24:44.343
Republicans nine to one,
you don't deserve the fucking job.

24:44.382 --> 24:45.974
Now, get on around here.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.745
If I lose the general election,

24:50.789 --> 24:52.347
I'll just blame Norman here.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.858
He's taking over
from Terri D'Agostino.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.258
She did good for you.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.194
Yeah, she did.
The national noticed.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.199
She's back at D.C.C.C. Looking
to target red-state delegations.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.326
After what she pulled off,
I hope she got a win bonus.

25:03.368 --> 25:06.064
Hell, yeah.
They gave her my share too.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.571
Wouldn't you know it?

25:07.606 --> 25:11.201
Tommy, whatever you need
going forward

25:11.243 --> 25:13.507
for the general election,
for the transition...

25:13.545 --> 25:15.308
I want to hit
the ground running,

25:15.347 --> 25:17.212
so I'm gonna need
to learn the agencies,

25:17.249 --> 25:19.547
the budgets,
the problems... all of it.

25:19.584 --> 25:21.609
Wherever you want to go,
whatever you want to look at.

25:21.653 --> 25:23.416
- See to it.
- Mm-hmm.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.320
It's a hell
of a goddamn job.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.383
Halfway glad to get out.

25:28.426 --> 25:30.519
I'm gonna miss it.

25:49.014 --> 25:51.141
Braddock case
running you in circles?

25:51.182 --> 25:54.242
Whole day was
a waste of time.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.652
Why not talk
to Wardell himself?

26:01.459 --> 26:04.087
Ask him if he killed
the witness against him.

26:04.129 --> 26:07.621
If he read the newspapers,
he already knows he's a suspect.

26:07.666 --> 26:11.693
Will he take a polygraph?
Call his lawyer.

26:11.736 --> 26:15.103
Tell him they're about to shift the
narcotics case over to the federal court

26:15.140 --> 26:17.665
because a state witness
was murdered.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.836
Tell him if his client
doesn't cooperate,

26:19.878 --> 26:22.813
he's looking at mandatory minimums
and no parole.

26:22.847 --> 26:25.441
The feds don't want
drug cases anymore,

26:25.483 --> 26:28.919
especially not a case that's gonna
fall apart without a key witness.

26:28.954 --> 26:32.390
Bluff. What have you
got to lose?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.915
Maybe he blows the box.
Maybe he passes.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.088
But he talks a bit
either way,

26:38.129 --> 26:41.792
and you, Detective,
get to listen.

26:43.468 --> 26:45.732
The fuck am I
looking at here?

26:47.839 --> 26:50.808
Birds... I think.

26:50.842 --> 26:53.504
You see that there?
I think that's a wing flapping.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.622
Shit. Fuck!

27:20.472 --> 27:22.463
Fuck it anyway, man!

27:24.309 --> 27:26.504
Mr. Bond?

27:26.544 --> 27:28.944
Hey. Call me Rupert.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.447
Thanks for coming over.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.972
Try to get
a running start,

27:32.017 --> 27:33.450
meeting with
my unit chiefs.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.214
No problem.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.289
Congratulations
on the election result.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.382
You'll be coming in
with quite a mandate.

27:40.425 --> 27:41.949
Maybe so.

27:43.194 --> 27:46.095
So, how can I help you
with the transition?

27:46.131 --> 27:49.828
There's not a lot of high-end
narcotics cases in the pipeline,

27:49.868 --> 27:52.632
- and major crimes...
- We'll cut it for political reasons.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.639
Once the polls put me
up there with Demper,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.073
people started
whispering in my ear.

27:57.108 --> 28:00.441
And I also heard
about your subpoenas...

28:00.478 --> 28:02.537
Andy Krawczyk,
Clay Davis.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.275
Sir, I didn't intend...

28:04.315 --> 28:06.840
To go after a couple
of Royce's money men four weeks

28:06.885 --> 28:08.910
before a primary election?

28:08.953 --> 28:11.478
Yeah. I think you're
wasted in narcotics.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.416
Let me guess...

28:15.460 --> 28:20.329
- How about V.C.U. As Unit Chief?
- What?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.299
Violent Crimes Unit.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.960
How about you
take that over for me?

28:24.002 --> 28:27.438
Carcetti ran on a platform
of dropping the murder rate,

28:27.472 --> 28:30.498
so V.C.U. Is where the sparks
are gonna fly, right?

28:30.542 --> 28:34.342
You're putting me in charge
of all homicide prosecutions?

28:38.149 --> 28:39.548
What about llene Nathan?

28:39.584 --> 28:41.347
She's moving up
to Second Deputy.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.455
I came in here ready to get bounced
down to misdemeanors or worse.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.485
Why would you think that?

28:51.529 --> 28:54.692
The subpoenas
and the fact that Demper...

28:54.733 --> 28:56.564
Demper lost the election.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.432
I won.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.906
And I admire your courage,
if not your loyalty.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.272
Lester.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.606
Excuse me?

29:05.643 --> 29:08.305
Forgive me.

29:08.346 --> 29:11.110
V.C.U. Is great.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.209
I'm more than ready to work
murders for you, Mr. Bond.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.743
Good.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.052
Rupert.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.751
But now she's told police

29:20.792 --> 29:24.489
sex was consentual
on Paul and Monnel only. So...

29:24.529 --> 29:27.327
- So, Randy...
- He'll be back tomorrow.

29:27.365 --> 29:30.266
- And the thing with the police?
- It's out of my hands.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.098
Turn it down, ladies.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.304
Quanice, lose the gum.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.305
Okay. Settle down.

29:41.346 --> 29:42.938
Mr. Prezbo!

29:42.981 --> 29:44.573
What's he doing
with a computer?

29:44.616 --> 29:47.278
We're gonna have a computer
in the class for special projects,

29:47.318 --> 29:49.115
and another thing...

29:49.154 --> 29:51.952
Dang!
They all new and shit.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.582
Leave the old ones
on your desks,

29:53.625 --> 29:55.923
and put your names
on the box

29:55.960 --> 29:58.224
on the inside cover
of the new ones.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.664
Okay. Did anyone have any trouble
with the homework?

30:01.699 --> 30:04.190
- Charlene?
- I didn't get it.

30:04.235 --> 30:06.533
- Didn't get what?
- None of it.

30:10.341 --> 30:12.002
Michael?

30:18.016 --> 30:20.314
That's great.
Good job.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.216
Come on, eh?

30:25.190 --> 30:26.817
Calvin, is this your work?

30:26.858 --> 30:28.655
'Cause it looks
like someone else's.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.160
No, I did my work.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.220
Okay. Next time,
try to remember

30:32.263 --> 30:34.527
not to copy Quanice's
name at the top.

30:36.534 --> 30:38.559
All right. Did everybody
get a new textbook?

30:38.603 --> 30:39.797
Yes.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.170
Great. Okay.

30:42.207 --> 30:45.005
Well, for now at least,
you can get those out of sight.

30:45.043 --> 30:47.375
- Whoa!
- That's right!

30:47.412 --> 30:50.142
Namond, why aren't
you in uniform?

30:52.116 --> 30:54.414
Why did you decide
not to wear it?

30:54.452 --> 30:57.910
I ain't in my right class,
so ain't no need for a uniform.

30:57.956 --> 30:59.685
Interesting.

30:59.724 --> 31:02.318
Why you always write down
everything we say?

31:02.360 --> 31:04.351
Trying to get
inside our heads or something?

31:04.395 --> 31:06.192
You trying
to get into mine?

31:06.231 --> 31:10.190
Chandra, do you think this is
a beauty salon or a classroom?

31:12.871 --> 31:15.533
Darnell, why didn't
you wear your uniform?

31:15.573 --> 31:18.474
I meant to. I did.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.204
Yeah, but after
a quart of vodka,

31:20.245 --> 31:22.042
it'd be hard to know
what color shirt

31:22.080 --> 31:23.945
you're supposed
to be wearing.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.745
And you find
that funny, Namond?

31:25.783 --> 31:28.581
Man, fuck you.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.521
Darnell has a drinking problem,
and Namond, we believe,

31:31.556 --> 31:33.319
suffers from
conduct-disorder issues.

31:33.358 --> 31:34.723
- Do you need a time-out?
- Fuck you.

31:34.759 --> 31:36.158
Yeah, he's got
a mouth on him.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.662
Chandra, is it necessary
to comb your hair in class?

31:38.696 --> 31:40.687
Fuck you,
cheese-faced bitch!

31:40.732 --> 31:43.292
- I should tell you...
- You ain't tellin' nobody nothing!

31:43.334 --> 31:44.892
Yeah. You know,
I was wondering

31:44.936 --> 31:46.563
why she was in the class.
She seemed so...

31:46.604 --> 31:47.662
Chandra, listen to me.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.332
Oppositional defiant personality.

31:49.374 --> 31:50.898
Get the fuck out
of my face, bitch!

31:50.942 --> 31:52.671
I'm sorry
you're having a bad day,

31:52.710 --> 31:55.838
but you're gonna have to
take a little walk with Miss Mason.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.678
Come back when you've
pulled it all back together again.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.446
Damn. It's bye-bye time
for my girl Chandra.

32:01.486 --> 32:04.614
Yeah, you think?

32:04.656 --> 32:08.717
Then to reiterate, this is
a polygraph examination...

32:08.760 --> 32:11.456
non-admissible,
and the answers to all questions

32:11.496 --> 32:13.464
are regarded as a proffer

32:13.498 --> 32:16.296
- with a limited grant of immunity.
- Agreed.

32:16.334 --> 32:19.064
Okay. To begin, please answer yes
to a series of questions

32:19.103 --> 32:21.765
regardless of whether or not
that answer is correct.

32:21.806 --> 32:24.502
Is your name
Anthony Wardell?

32:24.542 --> 32:25.804
Yeah.

32:25.843 --> 32:27.674
And you're from
Baltimore, Maryland?

32:27.712 --> 32:30.203
Right now I'm over at City Jail,
but I'm from East Side.

32:30.248 --> 32:31.340
So your answer is?

32:31.382 --> 32:32.974
Yeah, I'm from Baltimore.

32:33.017 --> 32:34.279
Are you female?

32:34.319 --> 32:38.187
Fuck is wrong with...
my bad.

32:38.222 --> 32:40.349
Yeah, I'm a bitch.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.288
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Chandra.

32:50.034 --> 32:51.695
We're working
on our short essay.

32:51.736 --> 32:52.896
If you...

32:52.937 --> 32:55.132
Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.834
Need to get down
to lay down.

32:56.874 --> 32:58.171
Namond, if you don't stop,

32:58.209 --> 33:00.177
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave class.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.941
See you sad-ass motherfuckers
in about three days...

33:02.981 --> 33:04.778
You're leaving class,
not school.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.283
What?

33:09.654 --> 33:11.713
What about now,
bitch? Huh?

33:11.756 --> 33:13.451
Huh?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.356
That's not necessary,
Namond.

33:15.393 --> 33:16.826
Oh, you gonna
suspend me?

33:16.861 --> 33:19.295
We're gonna have
a little talk.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.958
Man, fuck y'all.
I know the rules.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.833
You've got to suspend me.
School's got to have rules.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.769
He's right.
You've got to have rules.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.066
Can't just be throwing
that shit out.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.040
The point is:
I can call it like you want.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.042
You want him to pass?
He passed.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.840
You want him to come up inconclusive,
he's inconclusive.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.109
What the fuck
kind of science is that?

33:37.148 --> 33:38.979
Come on.
Did he blow the box or not?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.507
I'm here for you,
Detective.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.882
You know what we use
the polygraph for?

33:44.922 --> 33:45.946
Leverage.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.754
To get him in here
and fuck with him.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.587
No wonder
this shit's inadmissible.

33:59.904 --> 34:01.337
Let me guess.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.863
They're out in the hall
and Swatowski is telling them

34:03.908 --> 34:05.671
that he can make it go
any way they want.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.201
If you think that's how we play it,
then why let your client...

34:08.246 --> 34:10.304
Because you know
there's not much case left

34:10.348 --> 34:12.748
now that
your witness is dead.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.947
I don't need to expose him
to a federal charge if I can avoid it.

34:15.987 --> 34:20.617
And because even if
Swatowski bends it for our ears,

34:20.658 --> 34:25.118
he's let you know that
Mr. Wardell here did not blow the box.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.790
Yo, I wouldn't kill me.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.561
Even if it flips on me,
I ain't gonna do shit to the man.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.931
Why not?

34:30.967 --> 34:33.129
My moms and his...
they're, like, cousins.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.400
Came up together
in the Latrobe, you know?

34:35.440 --> 34:38.637
I've been knowing him since,
like, Head Start and shit.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.473
But he was gonna testify.

34:40.511 --> 34:43.639
What am I looking at on the first
conviction on this kind of waive?

34:43.681 --> 34:46.706
Seven, eight?
Shit, I'll be out in three and a half.

34:46.751 --> 34:50.812
You think I'm gonna kill my mom's
cousin's boy for three and a half?

34:50.855 --> 34:52.880
I know that man helped
get himself elected

34:52.924 --> 34:56.018
claiming that
I did me like that, but please.

34:59.363 --> 35:02.059
Bum-ass motherfucker was
gonna testify against me,

35:02.100 --> 35:05.797
and I swear to God
I feel bad he's dead.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.305
I do.

35:08.339 --> 35:12.673
Hey, llene,
I've been looking all over for you.

35:16.147 --> 35:17.944
Omar Little.

35:17.982 --> 35:20.109
From Bird's trial
a couple of years ago.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.778
- The stickup boy.
- Mm-hmm.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.947
He's in City Jail
on a felony murder.

35:24.989 --> 35:26.616
Store robbery,
West Side.

35:26.657 --> 35:29.854
When I gave him the card, I told him
it was for a light felony at best.

35:29.894 --> 35:33.853
Yeah, of course,
but he needs to get writ out of B.C.D.C.

35:33.898 --> 35:36.594
And put in protective
custody somewhere else.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.000
He's sharing his address
with about 800 other guys

35:39.036 --> 35:41.129
who have seen the business end
of his shotgun.

35:41.172 --> 35:44.073
- Why do you care?
- I'm pretty sure he's being set up.

35:44.108 --> 35:47.509
Really? How does that play with
the rest of the guys in the squad room?

35:47.545 --> 35:49.240
Look, all I'm asking
is that you move him

35:49.280 --> 35:51.248
to some county detention center

35:51.282 --> 35:54.046
at least until I have a chance
to work back up on this thing.

35:54.085 --> 35:57.248
Now, this card
ought to buy him that much.

36:00.525 --> 36:03.085
Is Hartford County
Detention Center quiet enough?

36:03.127 --> 36:05.891
- Yeah.
- Go pick up a writ in my office

36:05.930 --> 36:09.889
and tell Mr. Little my debt's paid.

36:09.934 --> 36:14.064
The fact is that homicides are
off 14%% % in the West Side this year.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.801
But I'm not gonna stand here
and take credit for that

36:16.841 --> 36:18.832
when all other U.C.R.
Felonies are up.

36:18.876 --> 36:21.401
- Why not, Major?
- A wise man once told me years ago

36:21.445 --> 36:22.969
when I wasn't
even a sergeant

36:23.014 --> 36:25.949
that you should never take credit
when the crime rate drops

36:25.983 --> 36:28.383
unless you want
to take the blame when it rises.

36:31.822 --> 36:34.382
Atten-hut.
Mayor-Elect is on deck.

36:34.425 --> 36:36.188
Please, back to what
you're doing.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.127
I'm just a councilman
here to observe.

36:38.162 --> 36:39.527
At ease, gentlemen.

36:39.564 --> 36:43.022
Major Daniels,
continue your presentation.

36:43.067 --> 36:46.093
In any event, rather than allow
my post cars to patrol,

36:46.137 --> 36:47.934
I put two-man cars

36:47.972 --> 36:50.202
in the post
with the worst drug corners:

36:50.241 --> 36:54.974
Edmonson Avenue, Poplar Grove,
Fayette and Baltimore Streets,

36:55.012 --> 36:57.310
North Avenue.

36:57.348 --> 37:01.808
Now, if nothing else,
a two-man car is more aggressive,

37:01.852 --> 37:04.946
and that helps push it away
from the most volatile corners,

37:04.989 --> 37:07.890
- which may be having an effect.
- Just pushing it?

37:07.925 --> 37:09.517
I'm not devoting my resources

37:09.560 --> 37:11.460
to cheap street arrests,
Commissioner.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.793
Instead, I'm trying
to bring every officer I can

37:13.831 --> 37:16.459
to bear on making
quality felony cases.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.434
I could do more
but, well, it's my opinion

37:18.469 --> 37:21.370
that not enough of the troops
I have are sufficiently trained

37:21.405 --> 37:23.737
to properly
investigate such cases.

37:23.774 --> 37:26.641
Major, you just
insulted your command.

37:26.677 --> 37:30.545
Respectfully, sir, too many
of my people have spent years

37:30.581 --> 37:33.812
chasing street-level arrests
while they grab bodies and make stats.

37:33.851 --> 37:36.479
But that doesn't teach you
how to write a proper warrant

37:36.520 --> 37:38.579
or testify properly
as to probable cause

37:38.623 --> 37:41.023
or use, and not get used
by an informant.

37:41.058 --> 37:42.787
I wish it were otherwise.

37:42.827 --> 37:44.852
But if I'm chasing
felony cases,

37:44.895 --> 37:47.295
I can only bring a minority
of my officers to bear.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.629
- You've got all of it already!
- That's right.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.862
Make a nigga work.
You like that shit.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.893
Ain't that right, motherfucker?

37:53.938 --> 37:56.805
You can't hide, son.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.968
Don't care where it is.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.945
In a nigga's ass crack,
I'll still find you.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.518
Damn. Fucked that man up.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.028
- Yeah, boy.
- All right.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.293
So we starting
a little later than I wanted.

38:21.332 --> 38:24.301
Yo, but you said you was gonna
creep out of school after lunch.

38:24.335 --> 38:25.962
I tried.
They won't put me out.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.733
Shit. Ain't no school
gonna hold me if I want to go.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.604
It's this new class
they put me in.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.168
It's so fucked up,
yo, they working all backwards and shit.

38:34.211 --> 38:35.735
All right,
let's get to this:

38:35.780 --> 38:37.771
Yo, Bobby,
you working the stash.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.942
Yo yo, why aren't
where we was yesterday?

38:39.984 --> 38:42.145
- The spot was right.
- This is good here?

38:42.186 --> 38:45.519
What the fuck is wrong with you?
He was on this strip yesterday.

38:45.556 --> 38:47.649
This ain't shit.

38:47.692 --> 38:50.490
Yo, if you don't want to sell
my shit, then fuck you, Kenard.

38:50.528 --> 38:52.189
I keep my money.

38:52.229 --> 38:54.129
This spot is just
as good as the other.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.655
Shit...

38:58.269 --> 39:01.136
Carv, do you know how much
that video camera costs?

39:01.172 --> 39:05.233
$4,200, which makes
our adventure with Fuzzy Dunlop

39:05.276 --> 39:07.210
look like a fucking
walk in the park.

39:07.244 --> 39:09.212
To get the camera
from I.S.D.,

39:09.246 --> 39:12.147
I had to get authorization
from your supervisor, right?

39:14.552 --> 39:15.917
Still, you lost it
doing police work.

39:15.953 --> 39:17.420
Your lieutenant
will understand.

39:17.455 --> 39:20.583
Marimow? You know what
that asshole understands?

39:20.624 --> 39:23.320
Burning motherfuckers
for petty shit like this.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.659
- Help me, Carv.
- This is not my problem.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.392
Don't fuck me, Carv.
Don't fuck me now.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.730
You know what this is?

39:30.768 --> 39:33.066
This is one of those
enabling relationships.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.537
Enable me, Carv.

39:34.572 --> 39:38.531
Enable me to find
my fuckin' camera.

39:42.246 --> 39:43.975
You're seeing pigeons?

39:44.014 --> 39:45.276
Last night we did.

39:45.316 --> 39:46.783
Me and Sydnor ran
the Westside

39:46.817 --> 39:49.081
looking at every pigeon
coop we could find.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.112
This morning,
nothing in the monitor.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.852
- Did you check the pawnshops?
- Every one.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.520
I fucking know this asshole Marlo
has my camera.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.552
- Aw, fuck me.
- What?

39:59.597 --> 40:01.064
You just reminded me.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.498
I had to brief this kid
last week who said he knew

40:03.534 --> 40:05.968
something about a murder
that Marlo's people did.

40:06.003 --> 40:08.631
- I meant to call Bunk on it.
- Bunk caught the case?

40:08.672 --> 40:11.971
No. Actually, he had a warrant for
the guy who supposedly got killed.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.477
I rode around with him
on it a while back.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.309
What about me?

40:16.347 --> 40:18.315
I got problems here, man.

40:18.349 --> 40:21.045
The only thing
you can do

40:21.085 --> 40:23.883
is get some wood
on Marlo Stanfield or his people.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.617
Scare him enough
to send the camera back.

40:26.657 --> 40:28.215
What do you
have on Marlo?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.988
I know he's a drug dealer.

40:30.027 --> 40:31.892
I can't prove it
or nothing, but I know.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.160
Detective Pitts,
pick up 2594. Pitts...

40:35.199 --> 40:36.860
Okay, listen.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.994
How about I let you
debrief the kid first?

40:39.036 --> 40:41.436
- See what he can give you.
- This gets the camera home?

40:41.472 --> 40:43.064
Maybe not,
but you talk to the runt,

40:43.107 --> 40:45.075
and maybe he gives you
some shit on Marlo.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.804
Maybe even gives you
a murder or two.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.072
Before you call
Homicide on it,

40:48.112 --> 40:49.340
you walk it
back to Marimow

40:49.380 --> 40:51.940
like the cat
with the mouse in its teeth.

40:51.982 --> 40:54.314
You bring him the murder,
he probably forgives the camera.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.842
Lumen, line 5.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.650
Lumen, pick up
the fucking phone.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.787
Looking for
Detective Moreland.

41:04.829 --> 41:08.162
Could you have him call Sergeant Carver
at the Western, please?

41:08.199 --> 41:10.895
Carver? Western?

41:10.935 --> 41:13.768
Hmm. Got it.

41:23.514 --> 41:25.209
Fuck that Bunk.

41:28.185 --> 41:30.813
- Thoughts on your cabinet?
- Lots of them.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.619
But top of the list,
Ervin Burrell's ass is gone.

41:33.657 --> 41:36.888
I told Royce to dump him
more than a year ago,

41:36.927 --> 41:41.125
but Clarence didn't want to piss off
the ministers until after the primary.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.099
Primary's over.
He can do it now.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.294
You think Clarence Royce
is gonna do you that favor?

41:45.336 --> 41:47.395
He's already thinking about
taking a poke at Elijah

41:47.438 --> 41:50.134
and running for the Seventh District
congressional seat.

41:50.174 --> 41:53.507
He's gonna need every black minister
in town to lay hands upon him.

41:53.544 --> 41:55.671
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- No, you won't.

41:55.713 --> 41:57.908
Royce can fire
a black police commissioner,

41:57.948 --> 42:00.246
but the newly-elected
white mayor cannot.

42:00.284 --> 42:02.343
Same brothers who voted
for you'll be at your throat.

42:02.386 --> 42:05.355
What if I got a black commissioner
to replace the son of a bitch?

42:05.389 --> 42:08.688
Under Burrell, the only black deputy
is Cawthorne, and he's 70.

42:08.726 --> 42:11.286
After that, it's just
majors and lieutenants.

42:11.328 --> 42:13.819
We go outside...
nationwide search.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.354
Deputy chiefs
in New York or L.A.

42:15.399 --> 42:17.526
Make more than
their police commissioner.

42:17.568 --> 42:20.731
If you're talented and black,
why would you be in Baltimore?

42:20.771 --> 42:23.365
I have often asked myself
that very question

42:23.407 --> 42:25.136
on a number of occasions.

42:26.844 --> 42:29.369
So I'm stuck
with Burrell. Fuck.

42:33.017 --> 42:35.042
Have a seat.

42:35.085 --> 42:39.021
Don't keep him late.
He's got to be at school in the morning.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.751
I thought you said
he was suspended.

42:40.791 --> 42:42.383
They're letting me
back in tomorrow.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.223
Miss Anna'd want me
to be home by 9:00.

42:44.261 --> 42:45.558
Don't forget to send him

42:45.596 --> 42:46.756
on to Bunk
after you're done.

42:46.797 --> 42:49.061
Look after him.
He's a good kid.

42:53.270 --> 42:54.931
You hungry?

42:54.972 --> 42:57.270
Yeah.

42:57.308 --> 42:58.969
Let's eat.

43:01.879 --> 43:04.780
Hey, kid, let me ask you
right off the bat:

43:04.815 --> 43:09.445
You know what a police
surveillance camera looks like?

43:09.486 --> 43:12.649
Councilman, you sure you don't want
to ride with Lieutenant Grace?

43:12.690 --> 43:14.214
I mean, she'll be
in command of the ship.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.453
What's the point
of a ride-along with the bosses?

43:16.493 --> 43:18.290
I need to see what
the troops see, right?

43:18.329 --> 43:19.489
Fine. I love
the idea of a mayor

43:19.530 --> 43:20.929
who knows what
we're up against.

43:20.965 --> 43:22.694
Officers McFarley
and Ginter,

43:22.733 --> 43:24.291
this is the mayor-elect,

43:24.335 --> 43:26.132
and he'll be riding
with you in sector three.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.797
- How you doing?
- Hey.

43:27.838 --> 43:30.238
Don't let him get captured.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.868
Obviously, I didn't know nothing
about it in the beginning.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.935
Little Kevin...
he just told me to tell Lex

43:34.979 --> 43:36.947
to go up to the playground
behind Fulton

43:36.981 --> 43:38.915
'cause his girl was up there.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.782
- And Lex got killed?
- Yeah.

43:41.819 --> 43:43.252
Where'd he get killed?

43:43.287 --> 43:46.552
So you actually weren't there
to see him killed?

43:46.590 --> 43:48.080
I told you.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.457
Little Kevin... he just told me
to tell Lex to go up

43:50.494 --> 43:52.792
to the playground and see
this girl Patrice.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.730
Then later, Kevin come up
to me and tell me

43:54.765 --> 43:56.494
Chris and Snoop
killed the dude.

43:56.533 --> 43:59.127
- What's Kevin's last name?
- I don't know.

43:59.169 --> 44:01.967
- You don't have his name?
- Little Kevin is all I know.

44:02.006 --> 44:03.371
So let me
get this straight:

44:03.407 --> 44:05.102
You told the guy
to go somewhere,

44:05.142 --> 44:06.370
and then you heard
he was killed,

44:06.410 --> 44:08.037
but you don't know
where he was killed,

44:08.078 --> 44:10.205
and you don't even know
if anyone ever found the body?

44:10.247 --> 44:12.613
- How do you know Lex is really dead?
- Everybody know it.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.118
- Who is everybody?
- Everybody from around the way.

44:15.152 --> 44:16.517
Yo, listen.

44:16.553 --> 44:19.113
People be saying that Chris
and Snoop be turning niggas

44:19.156 --> 44:21.681
into zombies for Marlo,
but I know that ain't true.

44:21.725 --> 44:23.454
When you dead,
you dead is all.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.052
Zombies, huh?

44:25.095 --> 44:28.656
You know what this is?
This is bullshit.

44:28.699 --> 44:30.963
- You're bullshitting me.
- No, sir.

44:31.001 --> 44:33.902
You were right there when this
Lex fellow got dropped, weren't you?

44:33.937 --> 44:35.666
- No.
- Yes, you were.

44:35.706 --> 44:38.140
You're an eyeball witness
who can get me Snoop and Chris both.

44:38.175 --> 44:39.608
- I told you...
- Look, kid.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.167
If you were there,
you can say so.

44:41.211 --> 44:42.838
We can do a lot for you,

44:42.880 --> 44:44.973
maybe help you out with this problem
you got at the school.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.142
I ain't got a problem no more.
I'm good with that.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.651
- You were there, right?
- Herc.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.620
Just say you were there!

44:50.654 --> 44:52.485
So how do you like
being mayor so far?

44:52.523 --> 44:54.616
I've still got to win
the general election

44:54.658 --> 44:56.558
and the inauguration's
not till December.

44:56.593 --> 44:58.652
So what do I know?

44:58.696 --> 45:00.357
Well, you can't do
any worse than Royce.

45:00.397 --> 45:01.762
City's going to shit.

45:01.799 --> 45:06.099
Yeah. Well, what do
you guys suggest I do first?

45:06.136 --> 45:10.402
An air strike.
White phosphorus.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.739
Drop that shit on everything
between here and North Avenue.

45:12.776 --> 45:15.506
Seriously.
That shit works.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.104
My brother's a marine, right?

45:17.147 --> 45:18.876
They use W.P. Over
there in Fallujah.

45:18.916 --> 45:21.817
Signal 13, shots fired.
200 North Calhoun.

45:21.852 --> 45:23.319
Bang.
There it is.

45:23.353 --> 45:26.652
Now you're gonna see some shit,
Mr. Mayor. Pardon my French.

45:30.794 --> 45:32.352
You know
what's fucked up?

45:32.396 --> 45:34.796
No one hears the gunshot.

45:34.832 --> 45:39.201
On the canvas, no one
even claims to hear the shot.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.101
So look,
our next move is

45:41.138 --> 45:43.163
to work back on
Wardell's visiting list.

45:47.845 --> 45:50.336
If the sergeant asks,
I'm on the street.

45:56.186 --> 45:58.984
Fuck, is that 13
on Calhoun Street?

45:59.022 --> 46:01.957
I don't know, but they 1032'd
10 minutes ago, sir.

46:01.992 --> 46:04.153
You're not dropping me off
at my crib, are you?

46:04.194 --> 46:06.162
I mean, you can
leave me, like,

46:06.196 --> 46:07.823
a block or two
up from here.

46:07.865 --> 46:09.298
I could walk
the rest of the way.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.528
Don't want to be seen
with the police, huh?

46:11.568 --> 46:13.559
Yeah.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.196
All right, boss.

46:15.239 --> 46:16.536
I'll pull over right here.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.177
What the fuck was
Carv thinking?

46:30.220 --> 46:32.085
This kid can't
give me a murder.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.613
We go right at Marlo.

46:34.658 --> 46:39.493
Fuck the backdoor when we can
go in the front, you know?

46:39.530 --> 46:41.521
Next I want a detective
at University

46:41.565 --> 46:43.965
in case the guy that comes out
makes any kind of declaration.

46:44.001 --> 46:45.832
Right, and have someone
in the room with him.

46:45.869 --> 46:48.303
Officer Leach is being transported
down to you by a sergeant.

46:48.338 --> 46:50.135
Service weapon's
with Detective Hollister,

46:50.174 --> 46:51.368
on their way
to Ballistics.

46:51.408 --> 46:53.968
No. No, looks like
a clean shoot.

46:54.011 --> 46:55.979
I've got spent shells
from two suspect weapons,

46:56.013 --> 46:57.810
different calibers,
both recovered.

46:57.848 --> 46:59.475
Right.
Yeah, I know.

46:59.516 --> 47:02.417
No, I'm not out here
at the scene.

47:02.452 --> 47:05.910
But call the P.I.O. And have him issue
a statement from downtown.

47:05.956 --> 47:08.117
Tell the S.A.O. That if they want
to have someone out here

47:08.158 --> 47:10.558
survey the scene, they need
to move now 'cause Crime Lab

47:10.594 --> 47:12.789
is finishing up,
and the O.C.M.E. Van is here waiting.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.661
Yeah...

47:14.698 --> 47:16.928
isn't that the Western
District commander?

47:16.967 --> 47:18.298
Yeah, that's Daniels.

47:18.335 --> 47:19.893
He's the duty officer tonight.

47:19.937 --> 47:22.098
Seems to know
his business.

47:22.139 --> 47:24.130
He ain't as bad
as some.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.120
Police.

50:06.336 --> 50:08.270
Baltimore Police.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.867
Okay. There's still 85 eligible

50:14.911 --> 50:16.970
from September
who need an October day.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.481
That'll work, ma'am.

50:18.515 --> 50:20.415
I'm counting on you
fellows to get it done

50:20.450 --> 50:21.781
before the end
of the month.

50:21.818 --> 50:23.479
I can keep you
on salary till then.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.456
You know what?
This ain't for me.

50:27.491 --> 50:30.085
Look. I thank you
for the opportunity, ma'am,

50:30.127 --> 50:33.927
but it ain't so much
just to bring a man for a day or two.

50:33.964 --> 50:37.991
I mean, if you had something

50:38.035 --> 50:40.094
where I was working
with these kids...

50:44.041 --> 50:47.033
Anyway, thanks again.

50:55.185 --> 50:57.676
- David.
- Hey.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.279
Thought you was
at Ida Wells.

50:59.322 --> 51:01.313
Language arts position
opened up here,

51:01.358 --> 51:03.849
so I came over last year.

51:03.894 --> 51:07.193
- Hey. What's up, Coach?
- Hey.

51:07.230 --> 51:10.028
You come over for some of
your boys today? Some kind of program?

51:10.067 --> 51:13.127
Nah. Something else.
Didn't work out really.

51:17.841 --> 51:19.001
Be well.

51:29.853 --> 51:31.650
You mind
if I give him a go?

51:31.688 --> 51:33.519
- Sure.
- Fuck you!

51:36.693 --> 51:38.354
Okay.

51:42.232 --> 51:43.699
But you're still
in this room.

51:43.733 --> 51:45.291
Fuck you!

51:50.707 --> 51:53.505
You know you're not going back with
the others till you learn to behave.

51:53.543 --> 51:56.478
- Fuck you.
- Until you show you can handle it,

51:56.513 --> 51:58.811
you're not going back
to your regular class.

51:58.849 --> 52:00.373
Fuck you.

52:00.417 --> 52:02.282
Look. And you damn sure
ain't going home

52:02.319 --> 52:04.184
'cause there ain't no more
getting suspended.

52:08.325 --> 52:10.259
Mr. Colvin, sir?

52:11.695 --> 52:14.562
Fuck you.

52:19.002 --> 52:20.799
'Cause I ain't feel like it.
That's why.

52:20.837 --> 52:22.930
This is bullshit.
I ain't reading

52:22.973 --> 52:24.406
no motherfucking book either!

52:24.441 --> 52:26.341
I don't even know nothing
about the damn book.

52:26.376 --> 52:29.812
And you always getting on my ass
and shit about some book.

52:29.846 --> 52:32.644
Fuck you,
you cheese-faced bitch!

52:32.682 --> 52:35.810
Albert, Albert,
settle down now.

52:35.852 --> 52:38.412
This gonna be harder
than we thought, man.

52:38.455 --> 52:39.854
It's fascinating, isn't it?

52:39.890 --> 52:41.289
All right. Class...

52:41.324 --> 52:42.848
This ain't no different
than the other class...

52:42.893 --> 52:44.952
Clinically speaking.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.424
Yo, your point's full.

52:50.467 --> 52:52.230
I'm hot.
Come and get it.

52:52.269 --> 52:54.169
All right.
I'll cover that.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.672
- Me too.
- I'm betting with my boy Randy.

52:56.706 --> 52:58.071
You about to get
your money taken.

52:58.108 --> 52:59.700
Come on.

53:01.211 --> 53:02.439
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

53:02.479 --> 53:04.106
Pay up, sucker.

53:04.147 --> 53:07.014
Randy, what are you doing?
Didn't we go over this?

53:07.050 --> 53:08.608
How many ways
can you make a four?

53:08.652 --> 53:10.347
Not enough
for his black ass.

53:10.387 --> 53:12.787
Look who's talking.

53:12.822 --> 53:14.119
Yo, he just come today,

53:14.157 --> 53:16.284
so he missed
the whole thing about the odds.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.987
Right.

53:18.028 --> 53:19.393
Randy,

53:19.429 --> 53:22.091
there's only three ways
to make a four,

53:22.132 --> 53:24.498
- but to make a seven...
- Six.

53:24.534 --> 53:26.900
That's good. So what should
have been your play?

53:26.937 --> 53:29.633
Should have bet
against her roll.

53:29.673 --> 53:32.471
Good to have you back,
Mr. Wagstaff.

53:32.509 --> 53:34.306
Come on,
roll 'em, man.

53:34.344 --> 53:36.471
I got 40.
I got 40 on it.

53:49.526 --> 53:53.018
Trick them into thinking
they aren't learning, and they do.

54:04.307 --> 54:06.400
Been looking
all over for you.

54:06.443 --> 54:08.104
You found me.

54:10.814 --> 54:13.442
Look, I been thinking,
Sherrod...

54:13.483 --> 54:16.111
we're going about
our thing all wrong.

54:16.152 --> 54:18.120
You know, look,
I made the mistake.

54:18.154 --> 54:20.816
I was thinking I knew you better
than you knew yourself.

54:26.830 --> 54:29.628
This corner... this corner
mess will bring you down fast.

54:29.666 --> 54:33.295
You know. I think you need
to come home, right?

54:33.336 --> 54:35.566
You come by tonight,
and we work this shit out together.

54:35.605 --> 54:36.902
I been thinking
about it.

54:36.940 --> 54:38.567
Why don't you just
step right now?

54:38.608 --> 54:40.473
I don't get paid till 8:00.

54:41.611 --> 54:43.340
8:00, huh?

54:50.186 --> 54:52.120
You all right?

54:52.155 --> 54:54.521
Just a little tired,
that's all.

54:58.695 --> 55:00.959
So I'm gonna
see you tonight, right, Sherrod?

55:25.121 --> 55:27.180
You want to help me
take his statement?

55:27.223 --> 55:29.953
Braddock case is down.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.483
Room two.

55:36.499 --> 55:39.627
You veteran crimefighters
got a name for this here, right?

55:39.669 --> 55:41.637
"Murder weapon"
or some shit like that?

55:50.914 --> 55:52.506
No fucking way.

55:52.549 --> 55:54.346
Slug from autopsy matches

55:54.384 --> 55:56.818
two more I pulled from
that smoke hound's backyard,

55:56.853 --> 55:59.151
block into the side alley
from where Braddock fell.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.384
- Our guy's dead from a stray.
- Hmph.

56:01.424 --> 56:04.882
He was shooting
at 40s and Clorox bottles blocks away,

56:04.928 --> 56:07.055
using potatoes for a silencer.

56:07.097 --> 56:09.725
Bite me.
That's ridiculous.

56:09.766 --> 56:12.599
So our guy's dead
because a bullet misses a bleach bottle.

56:12.635 --> 56:14.102
And this fuck Carcetti

56:14.137 --> 56:16.264
gets to be the mayor
behind this stupidity.

56:16.306 --> 56:17.705
I fucking love
this town.

56:17.741 --> 56:19.470
I do.

56:21.311 --> 56:23.302
Nice pull, Greggs.

56:24.314 --> 56:25.975
What's up, guys?

56:36.493 --> 56:38.484
Sherrod!
