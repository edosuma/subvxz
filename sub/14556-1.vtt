00:01.635 --> 00:03.304
DISPATCHER:
Code Six, body of a dead female

00:03.371 --> 00:05.906
at a construction site
off of Hill Street.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.442
REPORTER: No breakthroughs yet
in the brutal series of rapes

00:08.509 --> 00:10.178
that have rocked
the Southland...

00:14.848 --> 00:16.384
So, who we dealing
with here?

00:16.450 --> 00:19.053
It's the first rape
victim he's killed.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.088
Her name's Rachel Abbott.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.255
29 years old;
waitress.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.457
Roommate filed
a missing persons two days ago.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.293
And the new guy's here...

00:25.359 --> 00:28.296
the one the new assistant
director assigned?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.731
Don... David Sinclair.

00:30.798 --> 00:34.235
Homicide says she called
her job to report car trouble.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.936
Said she was going
to phone Triple-A.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.771
Triple-A has no record
of that call.

00:37.838 --> 00:38.906
Here you go, sir.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.674
-Thanks.
-No wounds

00:40.741 --> 00:41.709
or ligature marks.

00:41.775 --> 00:42.776
She probably suffocated.

00:49.016 --> 00:49.950
Lividity shows she was dead

00:50.017 --> 00:52.420
when the body
was moved here.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.110
TECHNICIAN:
The burn was made

01:16.177 --> 01:19.713
with the same implement used
on the 12 previous rape victims.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.781
Metal, heated

01:20.848 --> 01:22.716
to 300 degrees
and pressed into the skin

01:22.783 --> 01:24.852
for about
three seconds.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.990
Rape isn't enough of an assault
for this guy?

01:30.057 --> 01:30.991
He has to burn them?

01:31.058 --> 01:32.393
Branding asserts
his possession--

01:32.460 --> 01:33.861
like the women
belong to him.

01:33.927 --> 01:34.862
As the psych expert,

01:34.928 --> 01:36.264
tell me:
after 12 rapes,

01:36.330 --> 01:38.132
why did he decide
to kill Rachel Abbott?

01:38.199 --> 01:39.567
Death is
permanent possession;

01:39.633 --> 01:41.535
murder the ultimate act
of ownership.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.405
The violence has escalated
with each attack.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.873
He's been working up

01:45.939 --> 01:46.674
to this.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.709
MAN: He used something
to cover her face,

01:48.776 --> 01:51.512
causing asphyxiation.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.581
Like duct tape...
or a bag?

01:53.647 --> 01:54.515
No tape marks,

01:54.582 --> 01:57.017
so I'd say
an airtight substance,

01:57.084 --> 01:58.352
maybe a plastic bag.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.887
The marks on her wrists

01:59.953 --> 02:00.921
are from thin gauge rope.

02:00.988 --> 02:05.426
The severe abrasions
occurred shortly before death.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.395
She fought harder
when she realized

02:07.461 --> 02:08.896
she couldn't breathe.

02:08.962 --> 02:09.797
( phones ringing )

02:09.863 --> 02:10.764
WOMAN: Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.533
WOMAN 2: I have information
about the rapist...

02:12.600 --> 02:14.435
MAN: ...middle school, two miles
from where he attacked...

02:14.502 --> 02:15.869
WOMAN: Federal Bureau
of Investigation...

02:15.936 --> 02:18.306
REPORTER: Still no leads in
the hunt for the L.A. Rapist...

02:18.372 --> 02:19.607
ANCHORMAN:
...brutal series of rapes

02:19.673 --> 02:21.909
-( screaming ) -that have rocked
the Southland...

02:21.975 --> 02:25.913
CHARLIE: We all use math
every day... every day...

02:25.979 --> 02:28.916
to forecast weather...

02:28.982 --> 02:31.452
to tell time...

02:31.519 --> 02:34.455
to handle money...
to handle money...

02:34.522 --> 02:36.457
We also use math
to analyze crime...

02:36.524 --> 02:37.691
analyze crime...

02:37.758 --> 02:40.694
reveal patterns...
reveal patterns...

02:40.761 --> 02:43.297
predict behavior...
behavior.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.400
Using numbers, we can solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.043
DON: The dead girl's car--
we need to find it.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.578
If she was attacked
where it broke down,

02:57.645 --> 02:59.179
we do have a shot
at some forensics.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.114
1981 Honda Civic,

03:01.181 --> 03:02.182
blue.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.851
California plate,
2-B-A-I-triple-2.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.287
All regional agencies
are looking for it.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.589
DON:
Let's get on that.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.957
Thanks.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.559
David, I want you to oversee

03:11.625 --> 03:13.661
-the search for that car.
-All right.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.862
Terry...

03:14.928 --> 03:17.731
We need to go talk

03:17.798 --> 03:19.767
to Karen Silber again.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.002
Why Karen Silber?

03:22.069 --> 03:22.870
That's victim number 12.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.938
There were inconsistencies
in her statement.

03:25.005 --> 03:25.973
I'll get my stuff.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.941
You get on that car.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.444
He'll be talking
to Merrick

03:30.511 --> 03:31.612
before we're out
of the parking lot.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.146
It's a major case;
the Assistant Director

03:33.213 --> 03:35.549
needs to know he's getting
the facts without spin, so...

03:35.616 --> 03:36.784
Don, in the ten years
I've known you,

03:36.850 --> 03:38.218
you've never given
anybody spin.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.220
Even when you should have.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.189
I'm just happy for the help.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.358
We can use it.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.295
I'm sorry we have to ask
these questions again

03:47.361 --> 03:49.963
but you understand,
the case has changed,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.699
right?

03:52.833 --> 03:55.336
Did he talk about having
watched you

03:55.403 --> 03:56.770
as if he knew
your routine?

03:56.837 --> 03:57.838
He didn't say.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.373
His attitude was like

03:59.440 --> 04:00.541
I didn't have an existence

04:00.608 --> 04:03.611
outside of what
he was doing to me.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.846
You were just trying
to get through each moment.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.850
And I know
you couldn't see him...

04:09.917 --> 04:11.785
He taped my eyes shut.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.121
Maybe you remember
his hands.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.155
Were they rough?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.189
Were they callused?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.959
No, but

04:19.026 --> 04:21.194
they were strong.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.195
And cigarettes...

04:22.262 --> 04:23.597
His hands smelled
like he smoked.

04:23.664 --> 04:27.801
That's something you
hadn't told us before.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.538
How about we go over the moments
right before it happened,

04:30.604 --> 04:32.105
just to see if we can pin down

04:32.172 --> 04:33.407
the time any better.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.008
I don't remember that part.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.545
I've tried,
but I can't.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.314
Please... I'm getting married
next month.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.349
My fiancГ©--

04:41.415 --> 04:43.116
can you imagine
how this has been for him?

04:43.183 --> 04:44.418
For both of us?

04:44.485 --> 04:48.489
Karen... help me stop this guy.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.227
The brand...

04:54.294 --> 04:56.430
the four crosses...

04:56.497 --> 04:58.699
Did he say anything

04:58.766 --> 05:01.168
that would indicate
its significance

05:01.234 --> 05:03.604
-or meaning?
-No.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.577
Look, if I knew anything
that would help,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.779
don't you think I'd tell you?

05:22.122 --> 05:23.023
( clearing throat )

05:23.090 --> 05:23.891
Director Merrick...

05:23.957 --> 05:26.326
Agent Sinclair's catching me up
on the case.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.395
Sure.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.596
You get anything
from Karen Silber?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.698
Eh, she's still holding
something back,

05:30.764 --> 05:32.332
but we're working
on her.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.134
What about these tips?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.536
There's over 20,000
calls and e-mails.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.837
We're halfway through,
get another 200

05:36.904 --> 05:39.072
-every day.
-What about finding the car?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.343
We're on it.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.613
Good.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.651
Got anything?

05:57.425 --> 05:58.526
Merrick's just threatened
by you

05:58.592 --> 05:59.760
because you ran
your own office.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.496
He needs to feel like
he's contributing ideas.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.664
He's doing his job,

06:03.731 --> 06:06.233
making sure
I haven't missed anything.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.034
Have I missed anything?

06:07.100 --> 06:09.837
No... except several days' worth
of sleep.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.273
We got to break some kind
of lead on this,

06:13.340 --> 06:15.443
and I have no idea
where that's going to come from.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.583
* I know of a place *

06:22.650 --> 06:25.686
* Beyond forever *

06:25.753 --> 06:29.790
* I think that
we're on the verge of *

06:29.857 --> 06:33.293
* The future is now *

06:33.360 --> 06:35.863
* We're ready to run *

06:35.929 --> 06:39.933
* Let's break it down,
we found it... *

06:40.000 --> 06:43.270
( driving rock continues )

06:43.336 --> 06:46.339
( crowd cheering )

06:46.406 --> 06:48.476
21.07 seconds, 68.3 miles

06:48.542 --> 06:49.477
per hour.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.911
No one
would ever guess

06:50.978 --> 06:52.880
you don't have
a driver's license.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.148
MIT and Stanford
can't touch that.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.518
Professor Charles Edward Eppes.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.120
It's Larry.
Uh, give me a hand.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.756
So this is what distracts
you from helping me,

07:02.823 --> 07:04.091
your friend, your colleague,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.659
win the Nobel Prize

07:05.726 --> 07:06.894
for my 11-dimensional
supergravity theory?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.562
Well, in a way,
this project

07:08.629 --> 07:10.030
is related
to your theory.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.665
This go-cart?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.701
CHARLIE:
Go-cart?!

07:13.767 --> 07:14.835
This isn't
a go-cart.

07:14.902 --> 07:18.271
This is an extreme
gravity vehicle.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.807
Its shape

07:19.873 --> 07:21.575
will help inform
the next generation

07:21.642 --> 07:23.310
of high-performance automobiles.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.479
Okay, hooray for
making things go faster,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.748
but I fail to see
how this will provide me

07:27.815 --> 07:29.282
the necessary mathematical
breakthroughs I need

07:29.349 --> 07:31.318
to redefine
the fabric

07:31.384 --> 07:32.285
of the cosmos.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.421
You know, some physicists
do their own math.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.056
Ed Witten, Richard Feynman.

07:36.123 --> 07:36.857
Hurtful.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.458
I actually
knew Feynman.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.727
I actually think
of him often.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.961
You know, here's
a discussion:

07:41.028 --> 07:46.199
Why is it that we remember
the past and not the future?

07:46.266 --> 07:47.635
That's a tough one, Larry.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.537
Look, I'll have time on Monday.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.839
I'll run through
some equations for you.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.507
MAN:
Donny!

07:53.574 --> 07:55.242
Brisket. Must be Friday.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.476
What's up?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.145
I didn't have time
to drive home.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.048
Can I catch a shower here,
maybe borrow a clean shirt?

08:01.114 --> 08:02.215
Yeah, sure, be my guest.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.618
And tell your brother
to come down for dinner.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.053
-All right.
-You want some? There's plenty.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.155
No, I can't.
I got to get back to work.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.157
Hey, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.859
Just making sure
you don't take complete

08:11.925 --> 08:13.160
and total advantage of Dad.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.027
Are you kidding?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.196
He wouldn't know
what to do without me.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.685
( sighs )

08:41.555 --> 08:42.990
Charlie, what do you
think you're doing?

08:43.056 --> 08:43.791
Crime scenes...

08:43.857 --> 08:45.058
What kind of crimes?

08:45.125 --> 08:45.759
Get away from here.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.660
These are confidential

08:46.727 --> 08:48.261
case files.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.663
He just looked at the map.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.931
I made sure he didn't

08:50.998 --> 08:52.232
go through
anything else.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.200
Good.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.836
13 crime scenes spread
over a contained region.

08:55.903 --> 08:56.837
You guys are analyzing

08:56.904 --> 08:58.739
the significance
of those locations?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.708
Yeah, it's called
predictive analysis.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.775
The FBI pioneered it.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.110
I trained in it at Quantico,

09:03.176 --> 09:05.078
and it doesn't work
on sado-serial crimes.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.147
There's no way to predict
the location

09:07.214 --> 09:09.750
of the next attack.

09:09.817 --> 09:13.854
You know, I helped you out
on that stock fraud mess,

09:13.921 --> 09:16.056
and the IRS extortion case.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.892
Yeah. This is different.
It's not about numbers.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.028
Everything is numbers.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.840
Don. Hey.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.908
Um, can I show you
something really quick?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.310
-No, Charlie, I got to get...
-I know, I know.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.178
I know. Just come with me.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.713
Hear me out.
Hear me out. Come here.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.682
Check this out.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.652
You see
the sprinkler, yeah?

09:44.718 --> 09:45.853
Yeah, I see the sprinkler.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.987
You see the drops?

09:47.054 --> 09:48.588
Yep.
See the drops.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.723
Even using math,

09:49.790 --> 09:51.358
there's no practical way

09:51.424 --> 09:52.793
to predict where the next

09:52.860 --> 09:55.195
water drop will land.

09:57.464 --> 10:00.734
There's too many variables.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.870
However, say I couldn't
see the sprinkler.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.471
From the pattern
of the drops,

10:04.537 --> 10:07.207
I could calculate
its precise location.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.915
It's not about predicting
the next site.

10:17.217 --> 10:21.088
It's finding what
the sites have in common.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.155
The point of origin.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.623
Charlie, you're saying you can

10:23.691 --> 10:25.325
tell us where the killer lives?

10:25.392 --> 10:26.894
Yeah.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.703
DON: The movements
of a serial perpetrator

10:35.769 --> 10:37.504
are defined by his needs.

10:37.570 --> 10:41.141
He watches potential victims.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.343
Avoiding detection,

10:43.410 --> 10:45.913
he'll frequent public areas,
parks,

10:45.979 --> 10:48.749
streets that don't get
a lot of traffic,

10:48.816 --> 10:50.984
waiting for moments
of isolation.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.554
CHARLIE: Isolated areas,
high probability of attacks.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.823
ALAN:
TV distracting you?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.424
I could turn it off.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.360
No, it's fine, Dad.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.195
What else?
What else?

11:02.262 --> 11:05.833
Serial offenders cover
a wide region,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.667
but rarely commit crimes
near their homes.

11:07.735 --> 11:08.836
It's a "buffer zone."

11:08.902 --> 11:11.839
Early in a cycle, buffer
zones will vary in size,

11:11.905 --> 11:13.974
but as the cycle matures,
they tend to stabilize.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.843
These guys follow patterns.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.711
Exactly. There's also
"distance decay."

11:17.778 --> 11:18.712
The more intensity

11:18.779 --> 11:20.113
the attacker feels
about a crime,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.149
the further he will
travel to commit it.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.583
You don't want
to look at those.

11:23.650 --> 11:24.918
How do you gauge
"intensity"?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.554
By the nature and extent
of the injuries,

11:27.620 --> 11:28.655
the length of each abduction,

11:28.722 --> 11:30.690
adherence to
ritualized behavior.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.725
I've listed

11:31.792 --> 11:35.528
the incidents
by estimated intensity.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.396
Oh, great.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.865
This'll give me enough
to start putting together

11:37.931 --> 11:39.733
some expressions.
Just give me a minute.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.902
-Sure.
-Yeah.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.871
Who's up?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.138
ALAN:
Shawn Green.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.640
Green-- four games
without a hit.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.077
He's due.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.812
There's no statistical evidence
for a batter being "due."

11:51.879 --> 11:57.217
I say he gets a high fastball,
he smacks it out of the park.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.686
This is a tape
of yesterday's game.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.855
I know. I read
the box score.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.759
ANNOUNCER:
Three and one the count.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.694
A high fastball.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.362
Oh! Oh!

12:09.429 --> 12:11.031
Wow!

12:11.098 --> 12:12.432
Hey, you know,
that was an anomaly.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.433
Something like
that, Charlie.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.701
( Alan chuckles )

12:14.768 --> 12:16.503
Shut up, Dad.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.907
TERRY:
What you're talking about

12:19.973 --> 12:22.109
is a completely new way
of identifying a perpetrator.

12:22.175 --> 12:22.943
Exactly.

12:23.010 --> 12:23.944
Not who he is,
but where he is.

12:24.011 --> 12:24.978
The question is,
will it be accurate,

12:25.045 --> 12:26.179
and identify
a small enough area.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.916
-Morning, Thomas.
-You think Charlie can do it?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.150
He can be a pain
in the ass,

12:30.217 --> 12:31.985
but he is a world-class
mathematician.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.954
If it works, we have
a whole new system

12:34.021 --> 12:36.056
for analyzing
and investigating serial crime.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.357
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.093
TERRY:
Wow, that's impressive.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.661
Agent Eppes,
the dead girl.

12:41.728 --> 12:42.662
Rachel Abbott?

12:42.729 --> 12:43.663
What do you got?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.332
Microscopic particles
of fungal matter

12:45.398 --> 12:46.766
were found
in the victim's lungs,

12:46.834 --> 12:49.136
inhaled shortly
before death.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.337
Identified as
black truffles.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.438
The kind you cook with.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.472
So maybe

12:52.539 --> 12:53.640
the bag he put
over her head

12:53.706 --> 12:55.275
is the one
he bought them with.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.078
There's some 200 places
you can find

12:58.145 --> 12:59.446
black truffles
in this area.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.647
Plus more on the Internet.

13:00.713 --> 13:01.781
I'll, uh, I'll get on it.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.516
No car yet?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.018
Not yet.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.054
Look, I know you've got
a job to do

13:07.120 --> 13:08.055
for the Assistant Director,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.957
but there's a guy out there
who's attacking women.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.191
I need to know
where your priorities are.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.894
Sir, my first priority
is to assist you on this case.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.695
I've notified
every jurisdiction

13:15.762 --> 13:18.165
from San Diego
to Seattle.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.433
This car is not
turning up.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.837
All right.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.505
Listen up, everybody.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.441
We need to piece together
Rachel Abbott's last day.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.542
Where was she?

13:29.609 --> 13:30.643
Where was she going?

13:30.710 --> 13:31.979
If she was having car trouble,

13:32.045 --> 13:33.981
maybe she was on the way
to a repair shop.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.382
Did she go to a movie?

13:35.448 --> 13:36.183
Was she shopping?

13:36.249 --> 13:37.450
Call all the parking facilities,

13:37.517 --> 13:39.052
deal with the people
on the premises.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.854
Did she break down
on a freeway

13:40.921 --> 13:42.322
or a surface street?

13:42.389 --> 13:44.057
Ask CHP about abandoned
vehicles.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.726
I know you've done some
of this, but do it all,

13:46.793 --> 13:48.896
and then do it over again,
please.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.486
DON: Early in the cycle,
buffer zones vary,

14:13.553 --> 14:17.490
but as the cycle matures,
they tend to stabilize.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.162
He watches potential victims

14:22.229 --> 14:25.098
waiting for moments
of isolation.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.119
It's Monday.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.421
It's 2:45 in the afternoon.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.791
Monday. After lunch.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.326
Larry!

15:29.229 --> 15:30.563
Larry!

15:30.630 --> 15:31.898
Larry!

15:31.965 --> 15:32.899
( tires screech )

15:32.966 --> 15:34.367
( grunts )

15:34.434 --> 15:35.202
All right.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270
Sorry. I was busy working
on something.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.606
I know I'm supposed
to be going through

15:39.672 --> 15:40.673
some equations for you.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.475
Yes. I wondered
if I'd gotten the time wrong.

15:42.542 --> 15:46.013
Or the place.
Or quite possibly the dimension.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.714
No, I'm developing an
application for the FBI.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.848
You know what?

15:48.915 --> 15:50.183
You actually might
be able to help me.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.553
The problem involves
finding an origin point

15:53.620 --> 15:56.523
from evidence provided
by scattered effects.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.126
Somehow I doubt
we're talking about

15:59.192 --> 16:01.061
orbital paths
and black holes.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.129
Not exactly, no.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.265
Evariste Galois.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.534
Brilliant young mathematician
not unlike yourself,

16:07.600 --> 16:12.005
tackling the hardest problems
in his day.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.606
But he got distracted,

16:13.673 --> 16:16.143
He got caught up in politics
and romance.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.644
I know where you're going
with this.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.813
And at the age of 20,
he was killed in a duel.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.950
And who even knows
what he might've accomplished?

16:24.017 --> 16:26.519
I would say I'm
actually pretty good

16:26.586 --> 16:27.420
at avoiding duels.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.289
Charlie, what I'm trying
to say is

16:29.356 --> 16:30.990
you are almost 30 years old.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.193
You're at your peak
as a mathematician.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.395
Many mathematicians
do their best work

16:35.462 --> 16:39.966
in a very short time period,
maybe five to eight years.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.834
Hey, forget about me,

16:41.901 --> 16:44.837
forget about my
supergravity theory.

16:44.904 --> 16:45.838
You have abilities.

16:45.905 --> 16:46.839
You could be helping

16:46.906 --> 16:50.443
define the nature
of reality.

16:50.510 --> 16:55.748
All I'm asking is that you just
consider how you spend

16:55.815 --> 16:58.218
what time you have.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.934
( elevator bell dings )

17:15.001 --> 17:18.205
Actually, it's this
way over here. Hi.

17:22.275 --> 17:25.145
It's all right.
You all right?

17:25.212 --> 17:26.479
Hi. All right.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.781
Amita, could you put the first
map right up here, please?

17:28.848 --> 17:30.217
Hi.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.751
Here you go.
I'll help you with that.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.456
-Thanks.
-How you doing?

17:36.523 --> 17:39.025
Good. Nice to see you again.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.163
Okay, this map
was generated

17:43.230 --> 17:44.497
by an equation.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.498
Charlie,
don't erase that.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.567
No, it's okay.
It's an old case.

17:47.634 --> 17:52.472
I'm writing the equation here
in abbreviated form.

17:52.539 --> 17:56.343
I've pinpointed the area
most likely

17:56.409 --> 17:58.245
to be the perpetrator's
residence.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.113
You got the guy's address?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.348
Not the address? No.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.615
An approximate base.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.784
Um, okay, I'm using some
of the same techniques

18:04.851 --> 18:06.719
that physicists use
to find black holes,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.988
which can't be detected
in any way

18:09.055 --> 18:10.123
other than the effect

18:10.190 --> 18:12.192
that they have
on objects around them.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.493
Black holes?

18:13.560 --> 18:16.996
Walt, he based his work on FBI
theories of serial crime.

18:17.063 --> 18:17.830
Okay, professor.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.332
Why don't you just
walk us through it?

18:19.399 --> 18:22.535
Amita, can you put up
the enlarged version?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.804
The first point, really,
to take into account

18:24.871 --> 18:28.475
is that, when picking places
to attack a victim

18:28.541 --> 18:31.244
or dump a body,
the perpetrator will

18:31.311 --> 18:33.746
choose sites that appear
to be selected at random.

18:33.813 --> 18:34.781
He doesn't want you

18:34.847 --> 18:37.984
to make any conclusions
about where he lives,

18:38.050 --> 18:39.486
what areas
he frequents.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.287
Right.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.521
You know what?

18:41.588 --> 18:44.257
Let's do an elementary
demonstration, okay?

18:44.324 --> 18:46.426
So can you help me
just move this back?

18:46.493 --> 18:49.862
And let's slide
this over to there.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.698
Can you five--
one, two, three,

18:51.764 --> 18:54.634
four and five
please come up here?

18:54.701 --> 18:55.902
You know what?
You guys, too.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.105
Just, uh, please, distribute
yourselves randomly

18:59.172 --> 19:00.273
across this area right here.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.274
How's this?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.942
You mean, spread out?

19:03.009 --> 19:03.443
Like this?

19:03.510 --> 19:06.078
That's exactly right.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.580
But look what you've done.

19:07.647 --> 19:14.321
You have distributed yourselves
at equal intervals.

19:14.387 --> 19:20.793
while true random patterns
will include clusters.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.128
We're spaced too evenly.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.796
Exactly.
It's pretty difficult

19:23.863 --> 19:26.299
to consciously pick
a random sequence.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.534
Your target tried.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.335
But like you,

19:28.401 --> 19:30.937
he wound up
with roughly even spacing.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.940
In trying to avoid a pattern,
he wound up with one anyway?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.174
Yep. Locations
purposefully

19:35.242 --> 19:37.410
distanced from a site
not on your map,

19:37.477 --> 19:40.213
but clearly marked
in the perpetrator's mind.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.014
Namely, his residence.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.618
The equation reveals
the probability that each area

19:45.685 --> 19:47.620
has of being
the subject's base.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.088
Yellow's the hot zone.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.491
I had a feeling
about Silver Lake.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.361
I estimate an 87% chance
he lives in that area.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.895
You know, I don't know
a lot about mathematics,

19:55.962 --> 19:57.430
but this doesn't
make any sense to me.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.233
Makes more sense than this.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.969
You can't win
if you don't buy a ticket.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.170
Yes, this is truth.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.205
However, the odds
of this one being

20:06.273 --> 20:08.841
the winning ticket are
one in 41 million.

20:08.908 --> 20:13.045
Which means if you bought
20 tickets every week,

20:13.112 --> 20:17.717
you would win the jackpot
once every 40,000 years.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.319
Really?

20:19.386 --> 20:20.987
Yep. It's basic
probability theory.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.156
Agent Eppes, we've got
the dead girl's car.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.792
It's in a parking structure
in West Hollywood.

20:25.858 --> 20:26.926
Let's go. Test it.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.762
Run it against cases from
the past that've been solved.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.865
Miller, pull some files
for him to work with.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.967
Ever play craps?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.947
Agent Eppes!
Over here.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.049
Why don't you check
on the girl's car, David?

20:50.116 --> 20:50.850
Got it.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.552
Turn up anything yet?
What do you got?

20:52.619 --> 20:53.820
Someone waited here.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.788
We don't know if it is related
to Rachel Abbott,

20:55.855 --> 20:58.190
but we've got
cigarette butts, soda cans.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.692
The condition shows

20:59.759 --> 21:00.993
they were left here recently.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.028
Checking 'em for DNA?

21:02.094 --> 21:02.829
We will.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.963
Why wait here?

21:04.030 --> 21:07.099
He couldn't know her car
wasn't going to start.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.535
Nobody tampered with the car.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.839
The spark plugs fouled,
built up over time.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.518
( starter sputters )

21:33.993 --> 21:37.764
What street does that nurse
Karen Silber live on?

21:37.830 --> 21:38.565
Fountain, right?

21:38.631 --> 21:42.068
What's the exact
address?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.136
634 Fountain.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.405
Get her on the phone.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.146
That's her house right there.

21:54.213 --> 21:55.515
He was watching Silber.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.953
Then he hears someone
having car trouble;

22:01.020 --> 22:02.889
Rachel Abbott.

22:05.458 --> 22:08.227
Nice target of opportunity.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.729
But that's not why he was here.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.763
He's still after Silber.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.299
Karen Silber didn't show up
for work today.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.834
Nobody knows
where she is.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.503
Let's move.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.104
TERRY:
Call for backup!

22:23.976 --> 22:27.414
FBI! Karen Silber, FBI!

22:27.480 --> 22:29.215
Window open!

22:29.281 --> 22:30.750
FBI!

22:32.952 --> 22:33.953
Go! Go!

22:34.020 --> 22:34.987
( glass breaks )

22:36.188 --> 22:38.024
I'll check the house.

22:53.773 --> 22:57.677
CHARLIE:
Serial killer. Boston. 1992.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.146
Killer resided in hot zone.

23:00.212 --> 23:04.617
Serial rapist. Portland. 1983.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.687
Rapist resided in hot zone.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.321
Tonight, the Southland is rocked

23:09.388 --> 23:10.690
by the return
of the L.A. rapist.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.825
REPORTER 2:
...stalked and killed by a man

23:12.892 --> 23:14.293
who had already raped her...

23:14.360 --> 23:17.764
REPORTER 3: Karen Silber
was found dead in her own home

23:17.830 --> 23:19.899
after an apparent second visit
by the L.A. rapist.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.801
Neighbors insist
they heard nothing...

23:21.868 --> 23:24.236
We've ordered police protection
for the other victims?

23:24.303 --> 23:26.272
It's done.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.339
You think
he'll go after

23:27.406 --> 23:29.075
another previous victim anyway?

23:29.141 --> 23:31.744
No. He's too smart.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.079
Very rare for a serial offender

23:33.145 --> 23:34.914
to go after
the same person twice.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.383
He probably intended

23:37.450 --> 23:38.417
to kill her the first time.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.819
She said she put up
a hell of a struggle.

23:39.886 --> 23:40.820
Yeah, I think in his mind,

23:40.887 --> 23:42.321
he was just finishing
what he started.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.490
But we're still
at a dead end.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.726
What's your next
course of action?

23:50.129 --> 23:53.165
But today there was the tragic
discovery of Karen's body,

23:53.232 --> 23:57.937
again showing the marks
of the L.A. rapist.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.540
Charlie tested the equation
on five serial cases.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.009
In four, the perpetrator
lived in the hot zone.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.911
And he's predicted
a hot zone for this case.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.346
Small neighborhood
in Silver Lake.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.081
About 50 men live
in the vicinity.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.017
If we move fast, we can
get backgrounds and DNA

24:11.083 --> 24:13.786
-on that many guys in...
-In 48, 72 hours.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.221
No way we get a court order
off an equation.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.289
You're gonna have to pick up
discarded objects

24:17.356 --> 24:18.825
to get the DNA.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.093
Coffee cups, cigarette butts
and chewing gum.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.862
That's the plan.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.163
All right.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.266
Let's go.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.569
( computerized
techno music plays )

24:29.636 --> 24:31.137
( camera clicking )

24:35.875 --> 24:39.646
( computerized
techno music playing )

24:52.659 --> 24:55.628
* *

24:59.532 --> 25:00.800
Come on.
We got 16 so far.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.535
Let's go. Let's move it.
Come on.

25:18.417 --> 25:19.852
All right, that is number 34.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.520
We need the rest.
What's the holdup?

25:21.588 --> 25:23.389
DNA tests.
What do you expect?

25:23.455 --> 25:24.991
The lab needs
another day.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.196
He's out there somewhere.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.964
So is his next victim.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.318
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your girlfriend?

25:52.384 --> 25:55.387
You've met her before.
She's not my girlfriend.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.323
I'm her thesis advisor.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.860
Oh. Does that means she
can't be your girlfriend?

26:00.927 --> 26:04.130
It's, uh...
it's against the rules.

26:04.196 --> 26:04.931
Well, screw the rules.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.935
What's more important,
learning or love?

26:09.001 --> 26:10.603
Well, I'm sure
there's no rule

26:10.670 --> 26:13.139
against the father of her
thesis advisor asking her out.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.007
Go for it. Go right ahead.
Be my guest.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.208
Thank you.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.544
Actually, I'm spoken for,
Mr. Eppes.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.079
Back in Madras, my parents

26:20.146 --> 26:22.381
arranged for a marriage
to a family friend--

26:22.448 --> 26:24.884
a nice Hindu banker
from Goa.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.318
Really.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.487
Getting married?

26:28.554 --> 26:29.488
God, no.

26:29.555 --> 26:31.891
He's a total ass.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.794
Oh.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.696
Dad, you're, like,
hovering over us.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.965
And we have so
much work to do.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.366
I thought you already
helped your brother...

26:40.432 --> 26:42.969
Something this complex needs
to be checked and rechecked.

26:43.035 --> 26:46.072
There's one thing you and
your brother have in common--

26:46.138 --> 26:49.308
on some things,
you're both very thorough.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.278
Other stuff...

26:52.344 --> 26:53.746
you completely miss.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.081
( bird screeches )

26:58.184 --> 27:00.086
DON: Right.
No, you just have to...

27:00.152 --> 27:01.654
-( whirring )
-I'm sorry, what? I can't...

27:01.721 --> 27:03.255
Hold on.
30 minutes?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.824
Don, there's a problem
with the...

27:04.891 --> 27:06.325
15 minutes is the
difference between

27:06.392 --> 27:07.193
catching this guy

27:07.259 --> 27:08.861
and having another dead
woman on our hands.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.397
-Can you at least get us
the DNA results? -Don...

27:11.463 --> 27:13.099
Yeah.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.934
That would help.
Thank you.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.137
Charlie, did you just
say we have a problem?

27:18.204 --> 27:21.340
I did a test to verify
the equation's accuracy.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.408
I reversed it.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.609
Like running a film
backwards.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.311
I used the hot zone
as a starting point

27:25.377 --> 27:26.245
and went the other way.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.081
It was supposed to confirm
the known crime locations.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.083
It did not.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.052
I got 40 agents
working two days straight.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.554
You're telling me that, what,
you made a mistake?

27:35.621 --> 27:36.622
Not my mistake.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.157
It was in the data
that you provided.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.293
Those reports have been checked
and rechecked.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.830
It was where Victim 12
was attacked.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.332
So, either you guys
got it wrong,

27:46.398 --> 27:47.499
or I don't know,

27:47.566 --> 27:50.236
she lied to you.

27:50.302 --> 27:53.105
Why do you say that?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.106
It's evident

27:54.173 --> 27:57.777
that these locations fit
within a general pattern

27:57.844 --> 28:00.312
except for the first
Karen Silber attack,

28:00.379 --> 28:01.313
in Marina Del Rey.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.114
That's way outside

28:02.181 --> 28:04.650
the areas defined by
the other locations.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.318
I mean, just look
at these numbers.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.519
86 percent,

28:07.586 --> 28:09.521
75 percent, 81 percent...

28:09.588 --> 28:11.190
Two percent.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.659
She was hiding something.
Maybe this is it.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.327
Numbers don't lie.

28:15.394 --> 28:16.729
DON:
Why would she lie about where

28:16.796 --> 28:18.364
the attack took place?

28:18.430 --> 28:20.199
She had an ex-boyfriend.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.735
She promised her fiancГ©
she wasn't seeing him

28:22.802 --> 28:24.636
anymore, but...

28:24.703 --> 28:28.074
she and the ex
were still friends.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.509
So if she was attacked
in the area

28:30.576 --> 28:31.610
her ex-boyfriend lived...

28:31.677 --> 28:33.612
She'd lie 'cause
she didn't want the fiancГ©

28:33.679 --> 28:34.680
to know where she'd been.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.916
We're going to
need the address

28:36.983 --> 28:38.851
of that ex-boyfriend.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.223
Okay.

28:44.290 --> 28:47.026
Charlie, I have a new location
for the first Silber attack.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.028
She was probably in Los Feliz,

28:49.095 --> 28:50.897
-near Hillhurst and Franklin.
-Great.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.901
I'll run the equation again.
We'll get a more accurate map.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.571
Wait a minute.
What's going on?

28:59.638 --> 29:01.841
We got the last results.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.810
All 52 guys from the
hot zone are cleared.

29:03.876 --> 29:04.977
Not a single match.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.946
Karen Silber lied about
where she was attacked.

29:07.013 --> 29:07.980
We got the right location.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.515
Charlie's generating
a better map.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.983
Please, just come in.
Be patient.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.185
-( cell phone rings )
-Get on that map.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.054
Yeah. Charlie...

29:15.121 --> 29:16.188
It works.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.991
The new location fits.
The map's much more accurate,

29:19.058 --> 29:21.460
-from 87% to 96%.
-Give me the new zone.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.261
He wants the new zone.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.331
Hyperion between
Melrose and Del Mar.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.666
Hyperion
between Melrose and Del Mar.

29:27.733 --> 29:28.801
Marathon between Lucile...

29:28.868 --> 29:30.937
Marathon between
Lucile and Robinson.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.139
Robinson between
Marathon and Winslow.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.541
Robinson between
Marathon and Winslow.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.642
Robinson...

29:36.708 --> 29:39.311
between Marathon and Winslow?

29:40.679 --> 29:41.814
And Winslow...

29:41.881 --> 29:45.551
between Edgecliffe
and Micheltorena?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.019
With better data I was able

29:47.086 --> 29:48.487
to narrow it down
to a smaller area.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.290
You only need to clear
about 20 guys.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.759
I would assume that this
will allow you, you know,

29:53.826 --> 29:57.029
a far more efficient use
of manpower and...

29:57.096 --> 29:59.832
Charlie, you're telling me the
same area, it's only smaller.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.400
Exactly, smaller
means more accurate.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.435
No, we already cleared
those 20 guys.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.172
Um, what?

30:06.238 --> 30:09.308
No, that's... well...

30:09.375 --> 30:12.378
you must have missed him
because, uh...

30:12.444 --> 30:16.582
Well, either, um, you cleared
someone you shouldn't have,

30:16.648 --> 30:19.218
or, uh... no, he lives there.
You just didn't find him.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.752
You're not listening to me,
okay?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.655
We cleared all males
in that zone.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.926
And that means you missed him.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.060
Look, you just said

30:28.127 --> 30:30.562
we're dealing with degrees
of probability.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.431
96%, you know what that means?
I helped build

30:32.498 --> 30:34.766
an entire Weak Force theory
with less than that.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.567
Yeah.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.537
Well, it didn't work.
You understand?

30:38.604 --> 30:40.272
I'm sorry.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.453
Charlie...

31:00.359 --> 31:02.561
Look, let's take a break, huh?

31:02.628 --> 31:05.264
Get some coffee.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.433
Charlie.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.169
I'm trying to think.

31:33.192 --> 31:36.862
I'm not running
the investigation anymore.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.130
If there's one agent
in this office

31:38.197 --> 31:39.932
that can crack
this case, it's you.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.233
Yeah, but I didn't.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.103
I don't think you realize
how hard you push yourself.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.205
Everything we tried
was going to be a long shot.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.940
Yeah, well, I got to go
brief De Winter.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.976
He's taking over.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.810
I'll do it.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.480
Thanks.

32:06.558 --> 32:11.030
( electronic games blipping )

32:20.572 --> 32:22.608
Larry...

32:22.674 --> 32:26.545
something went wrong
and I don't know what.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.180
And now it's like
I can't even think.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.381
Well, let me guess.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.784
You tried to solve a problem
involving human behavior

32:32.851 --> 32:35.054
and it blew up in your face.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.155
Yeah, pretty much.

32:36.222 --> 32:39.491
Okay, well, Charles,
you are a mathematician.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.461
You're always looking
for the elegant solution.

32:42.528 --> 32:46.398
The human behavior is
rarely, if ever, elegant.

32:49.868 --> 32:52.404
The universe is full

32:52.471 --> 32:53.805
of these odd

32:53.872 --> 32:56.175
bumps and twists.

32:56.242 --> 32:59.611
You know, perhaps you need
to make your equation

32:59.678 --> 33:01.447
less elegant,
more complicated,

33:01.513 --> 33:04.783
less precise,
more descriptive.

33:04.850 --> 33:05.884
It's not going
to be as pretty,

33:05.951 --> 33:10.256
but it might work
a little bit better.

33:10.322 --> 33:14.560
And, Charlie, when you're
working on human problems,

33:14.626 --> 33:17.596
there's going to be pain
and disappointment.

33:17.663 --> 33:21.433
You've got to ask yourself
is it worth it?

34:05.211 --> 34:07.879
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow. Bye.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.215
Bye.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.769
( screaming )

34:33.472 --> 34:35.607
( crickets chirping )

34:37.309 --> 34:39.145
I can't get my
head around it.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.279
What are we missing?

34:40.346 --> 34:41.480
Where's the problem?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.315
And how do we make it work?

34:43.382 --> 34:45.016
We have to make it work.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.985
We need to retest it.
We need another run.

34:47.052 --> 34:48.287
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

34:48.354 --> 34:50.122
Well, look. I know
that it's gonna be hard

34:50.189 --> 34:51.957
for you to talk
your boss into doing it again,

34:52.023 --> 34:53.692
-but we can't stop
after one attempt. -Charlie.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.295
These kind of new methods
require repeated trials.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.096
Charlie, I'm not
on the case anymore.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.499
Okay?

35:00.566 --> 35:01.700
Why?

35:04.970 --> 35:07.306
Because my supervisor wanted

35:07.373 --> 35:09.241
fresh eyes on it.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.644
Well. maybe the math
is not the problem.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.381
DON:
What do you mean?

35:15.447 --> 35:17.183
Well, you just said
that there was something

35:17.249 --> 35:18.684
you couldn't get
your head around,

35:18.750 --> 35:21.153
and I know for a fact
that it can't be the math.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.288
What else is there?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.256
ALAN:
Hey, maybe he's right.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.926
I mean, this sprinkler
had totally made sense.

35:27.993 --> 35:30.128
That you could track
back from the location

35:30.196 --> 35:31.430
and find out
where the guy lives.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.998
Right? Totally
made sense.

35:33.064 --> 35:36.335
Maybe we're thinking about
this guy in too narrow a focus.

35:36.402 --> 35:37.336
Are you saying

35:37.403 --> 35:38.537
I need to consider more

35:38.604 --> 35:40.206
than his criminal activities?

35:40.272 --> 35:41.207
No, not exactly.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.374
I'm saying we maybe
need to consider

35:42.441 --> 35:43.775
more than just where
he lives. Look at me.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.744
If you designed an equation
to find my origin,

35:45.811 --> 35:48.380
you wouldn't get my apartment
'cause I'm almost never there.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.548
My base would be my office.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.550
( echoing ):
Would be my office.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.090
Which means...

35:59.157 --> 36:04.963
he'll use his home and his work
as points of origin.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.232
DON:
Exactly.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.599
I can design an equation

36:07.666 --> 36:09.301
to identify two hot zones.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.069
Why didn't I
think of that?

36:11.136 --> 36:12.070
Don...

36:12.137 --> 36:13.772
Dad.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.175
That's brilliant.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.551
This new equation works back
from the crime scenes

36:25.617 --> 36:26.918
to identify two locations.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.588
Okay, so two hot zones,
but very, very different.

36:29.655 --> 36:30.389
Right.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.324
The old zone...

36:32.391 --> 36:34.660
was residential.
The new zone is in

36:34.726 --> 36:36.127
-an industrial area.
-Home and work.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.496
We know
he wasn't in the home zone,

36:37.563 --> 36:38.864
What would be helpful
is if we had

36:38.930 --> 36:39.831
a blowup
of the industrial.

36:39.898 --> 36:40.832
It's printing out.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.770
Theoretically, if you find
somebody in this new zone,

36:44.836 --> 36:47.606
the work zone, he should have
a link to the old one, yeah?

36:47.673 --> 36:49.275
Enough theory. Let's test it.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.677
This is Special Agent Eppes
in Los Angeles.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.212
I need to run
a database search for companies

36:54.280 --> 36:57.883
in the industrial district of
Vernon, Los Angeles, California.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.899
Peter Carlucci.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.568
Hey, guys.
Check it out.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.004
Here's a second hot zone.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.105
What works with the first?

37:20.171 --> 37:22.708
I'm running employee databases
of companies in the new zone

37:22.774 --> 37:25.143
against FBI databases
of sexual offenders.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.313
We narrowed it
to eight guys.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.980
"Adam Klanzani, 77."

37:29.047 --> 37:31.317
He's too old.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.118
"John Dorstaf, pedophile."

37:33.184 --> 37:34.386
It's not him.

37:34.453 --> 37:38.457
"Victor Tommani,
in jail until two months ago."

37:38.524 --> 37:40.792
Okay, here's something.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.394
What is it?

37:42.461 --> 37:43.829
"Roland Haldane."

37:43.895 --> 37:45.597
Runs a small
party rental company in Vernon.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.734
Arrested for attempted rape
12 years ago.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.336
-Good morning.
-Good morning, guys.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.803
Hold on.
We're headed out of here.

37:51.870 --> 37:52.871
-Miller?
-What's going on?

37:52.938 --> 37:54.540
-Yo. -I need you to check out
this guy's residence.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.174
-Let's go, guys.
-What's going on?

37:56.241 --> 37:57.409
I'll tell you on the way.
Come on.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.678
Let's move.
Let's go!

38:05.484 --> 38:08.219
The suspect hasn't
returned to his house.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.289
Well, that looks
like his van there.

38:18.830 --> 38:22.434
Terry, why don't you
check for other entrances.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.581
MAN:
Hang on.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.116
Hi.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.317
Can I help you?

38:39.385 --> 38:40.986
Yeah, I'm Special Agent Eppes.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.521
This is Special Agent Sinclair.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.856
We're following up
on a report.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.858
Mind if we come in?

38:46.925 --> 38:48.427
Sure. Come on.

38:54.733 --> 38:57.235
HALDANE:
Bootleg DVDs?

38:57.302 --> 39:00.205
Being sold around here?

39:00.271 --> 39:03.274
You Feds are serious
about this pirating stuff.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.143
Yep, we are.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.547
You prepare food here?

39:08.614 --> 39:10.816
I do a little
catering on the side.

39:11.917 --> 39:15.053
You cook?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.889
It's a one-man operation.
I do everything.

39:26.498 --> 39:28.834
CrГЁme brГ»lГ©e.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.570
David, it's him!

40:06.872 --> 40:07.673
Drop that knife!

40:07.739 --> 40:09.107
Drop the knife or I'll shoot!

40:10.141 --> 40:11.209
Drop it now!

40:11.276 --> 40:13.011
Drop it!

40:13.078 --> 40:14.079
Drop that knife!

40:24.490 --> 40:25.724
Drop it!

40:28.627 --> 40:30.896
( glass shattering )

40:30.962 --> 40:31.963
( groans )

40:32.030 --> 40:33.965
( gunshots )

40:48.379 --> 40:49.380
( muffled groans )

40:49.447 --> 40:52.751
Shh. Shh.
Hang on, hang on.

40:52.818 --> 40:54.219
( panting )

40:54.285 --> 40:56.522
( gasping sharply )

40:56.588 --> 40:58.690
( crying hysterically )

40:58.757 --> 41:00.325
Shh.

41:00.391 --> 41:02.460
-( crying continues )
-( phone dialing )

41:02.528 --> 41:05.396
Shh. It's okay.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.865
-Terry!
-Don!

41:06.932 --> 41:08.233
Terry!

41:08.299 --> 41:09.467
Don, in here!

41:13.805 --> 41:15.874
She's alive.
I called paramedics.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.543
-They're on their way.
-You all right?

41:17.609 --> 41:19.144
-Yeah.
-( Don coughs )

41:19.210 --> 41:20.211
You okay?

41:20.278 --> 41:22.247
( panting )

41:25.116 --> 41:26.417
( panting )

41:26.484 --> 41:27.819
You all right there?

41:27.886 --> 41:30.421
( breathlessly ):
Yeah.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.890
Thanks.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.024
Good job.

41:33.091 --> 41:34.225
Thanks.

41:34.292 --> 41:38.897
( siren blaring, garbled
police radio transmission )

41:47.973 --> 41:48.707
Thanks.

41:48.774 --> 41:49.975
Hey, Charlie.

41:50.041 --> 41:53.311
TERRY:
I'm going to talk to the victim.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.581
Hey.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.716
Come here.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.451
There's something
I want to show you.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.254
Haldane lived
in Century City,

42:03.321 --> 42:06.592
but he'd just moved there
three weeks ago.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.627
Look where he used to live.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.932
That's why we couldn't find him
in the first hot zone.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.968
He was there, but he moved.

42:17.035 --> 42:20.038
That's a hell of an equation,
Charlie.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.307
Thank you.

42:37.522 --> 42:38.924
Come here.

42:39.958 --> 42:41.192
CHARLIE:
Everything is numbers.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.228
( echoes ):
Numbers, numbers, numbers...
