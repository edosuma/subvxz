[clinking]

00:02.870 --> 00:05.437
Ooh, ham and eggs!
Thanks, Kate.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.706
Oh, no.
ALF, these are for everyone.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.807
Oh.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.443
[sneezes]

00:13.447 --> 00:15.781
Actually, I'm in the mood
for oatmeal.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.250
I think I'll, uh,
get somethin' at work.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.753
I'm gonna have
to change my shirt.

00:20.755 --> 00:21.720
[knock on door]

00:21.722 --> 00:24.490
- Who is it?
- 'It's me, Jake.'

00:24.492 --> 00:25.991
Oh, come on in, Jake.

00:25.993 --> 00:29.194
Joy. That's twice
my appetite's been killed.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.631
Hey, morning, Jake Kiboody.
What brings you over?

00:32.633 --> 00:35.501
Aunt Raquel and Uncle Trevor
have been fightin' again.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.102
What was it about this time?

00:37.104 --> 00:38.771
Allow me.

00:38.773 --> 00:42.441
Raquel thinks Trevor's a slob,
that he doesn't appreciate her

00:42.443 --> 00:45.110
and some other
female paranoia nonsense.

00:47.882 --> 00:51.850
Hey, you crawl under people's
houses, you hear things.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.686
[theme music]

01:58.252 --> 02:00.452
Jake, would you like
to join us for breakfast?

02:00.454 --> 02:01.753
Whatcha havin'?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.789
Green eggs and ham.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.591
Pass.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.860
[knock on door]

02:07.862 --> 02:10.429

'Hey, Tanners, it's me!'

02:10.431 --> 02:14.099
Oh, great.
Pig outus interruptus.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.735
Yeah.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.204
Oh, come on in, Trevor.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.841
- Oh, what's up?
- Uh, nothing much.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.743
And even if there was
I'm not the kind of guy

02:24.745 --> 02:26.278
that would burden you
with my problems.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.846
Raquel just threw me out.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.415
Oh, Trevor, I'm sorry.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.917
She called me a slob.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.085
We know.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.089
- Hey, I didn't tell 'em.
- Who did?

02:39.026 --> 02:41.493
Uh...I did.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.231
Somehow she got
the ridiculous idea

02:46.233 --> 02:48.700
that she doesn't
love me anymore.

02:48.702 --> 02:52.070
So, are you, uh, looking
for a place to stay, Trevor?

02:53.307 --> 02:54.640
Ow!

02:55.543 --> 02:57.176
Uh, leg cramp.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.446
I don't know
where I'm gonna stay.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.483
Do you know anybody that would
kindly put me up for the night?

03:04.485 --> 03:05.817
Well..

03:05.819 --> 03:07.219
Ow!

03:09.823 --> 03:11.790
You can stay here, Trevor.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.027
Oh, well, thanks.
Heh, I-I'll be right back.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.729
Come on, Jake. Help me pick
my clothes off the lawn.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.902
Oh, where does
that freeloading sloth

03:23.904 --> 03:26.405
get off crashing our party?

03:26.407 --> 03:27.773
I don't know, ALF.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.275
Why don't you have
a sloth-to-sloth talk with him?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.949
I can't believe it,
this makes two broken homes

03:36.951 --> 03:40.052
I've come from in one year.
I'm a jinx.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.789
Oh, it's not your fault.
They've had fights before.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.558
Why does Mr. Ochmonek
have to stay here?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.494
Yeah.
Are there no work farms?

03:49.496 --> 03:51.063
Are there no prisons?

03:52.066 --> 03:55.067
ALF, try to be
a little more sensitive.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.969
I am sensitive.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.370
I'm sensitive to the fact

03:58.372 --> 04:01.640
I'm looking at another stay
in garage med.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.110
Hide, ALF.
He's coming back.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.144
Oh!

04:07.615 --> 04:09.248
I really appreciate this, Kate.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.749
Oh, don't mention it.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.684
And don't worry, I'm sure
this will all blow over

04:12.686 --> 04:14.953
in about a week or two.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.823
Trevor, when you asked
if we could put you up

04:17.825 --> 04:21.760
for the night, we assumed
you meant for the night.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.996
That's another thing
Raquel hates about me.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.864
I'm vague.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.233
You can use Brian's room.
He can double up with Lynn.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.270
- No way!
- I'll take that deal.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.771
No way!

04:32.773 --> 04:35.641
Hey, maybe you and Willie
could sleep in Brian's room.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.875
No way.

04:37.745 --> 04:38.810
What a bummer!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.045
Just don't snore.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.714
It's like sleeping
with a buzz saw.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.416
I'll trade ya.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.817
I'll sleep with the buzz saw

04:45.819 --> 04:47.853
you sleep with the lawn mower.

Good morning, Trevor!

Oh, hi, Kate.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.316
Willie.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.351
I hope my suburb blaster
didn't wake you up.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.521
No, no.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.790
This was me and Raquel's
favorite song.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.659
Boy, that Sinatra could sing.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.662
That sounds like Pink Floyd.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.930
I know that, Willie.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.865
I was making
two separate comments.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.236
Did you get enough to eat?

05:38.238 --> 05:41.573
Actually no.
All I could find was cereal.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.974
When you guys
have a midnight snack

05:42.976 --> 05:44.810
you pull out all the stops.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.145
Oh, you didn't do this?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.014
I did.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.684
I had a craving last night.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.320
For green pepper?

05:55.322 --> 05:57.789
They make me drowsy.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.257
Well, I'd offer you
a bowl of cereal

05:59.259 --> 06:01.293
except I used
the last of the milk.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.096
[sighs]
I'll just..

06:04.098 --> 06:07.232
...go down to the store
and get some.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.769
Why do that? I'll just borrow
some from Mrs. Byrd.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.038
Oh, there's no need
to bother her, Trevor.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.474
Ah, it's okay.
She owes me.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.310
I lent her your hedge clippers,
and she never gave them back.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.146
How inconsiderate.

06:25.119 --> 06:29.521
I say we lock the door,
throw away the key and move.

06:29.523 --> 06:35.727
I assume that we have you
to thank for this...mess.

bimonthly feeding frenzy

06:39.666 --> 06:42.567

06:42.569 --> 06:44.770
So this one doesn't count, okay?

06:44.772 --> 06:47.773
It counts. Okay?

06:47.775 --> 06:50.308
- Good morning.
- 'Morning, Brian. Lynn.'

06:51.712 --> 06:53.011

Yeah, but this one
doesn't count.

you're not dressed?

I was too tired.
I didn't get any sleep.

Mr. Ochmonek

do this to me?

Ooh.

already at each other's throats.

We're not
at each other's throats.

He's not here, Kate-le rustler.

there was a package for him

08:07.254 --> 08:09.054
Could have been a crank call.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.290
You called him, didn't you?

08:12.292 --> 08:15.727
I had to get him out of here.
Even for an hour!

08:15.729 --> 08:19.931
Raquel's saying stuff like
she's never gonna take him back.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.868

what Raquel is saying?

You know what.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.479
Yeah, Willie, I know what

08:34.481 --> 08:38.483
but if I have to do it, the
least you could do is say it.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.287
Go...to the kitchen.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.656
Thank you.

I hope this means that--

seems awfully final.

I saw Trevor sneaking out

09:14.388 --> 09:16.288
of the widow Byrd's house
this morning.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.925
He couldn't even wait one day
before he started slumming it.

T-that..
No.

the widow Byrd's to borrow milk.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.337
Oh, no.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.240
Raquel saw Trevor
at Mrs. Byrd's.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.242
It isn't enough
that he's having a sordid affair

09:37.244 --> 09:39.277
but he has to have it out
in the open where anybody

09:39.279 --> 09:42.547
with a decent pair
of binoculars can see.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.717
Raquel, he just went over there
to borrow some milk.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.420
Well, since you've obviously
taken his side

09:48.422 --> 09:49.521
you can keep him.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.690
Come on, Jake,
you're the man of the house now.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.659
Hey, does this mean I get
to watch sports in my underwear?

10:00.300 --> 10:04.436
Hey, why didn't you guys tell me
we were having moose tonight?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.538

ruined my appetite.

the entire neighborhood.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.175
What do you mean, Raquel?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.944
Calling everybody
about Trevor and me.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.813
Just because I occasionally make

11:21.815 --> 11:23.348

11:23.350 --> 11:25.350
doesn't mean my business
is any of their business.

So would you mind
minding your own business?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.255
Well, I certainly
didn't tell anyone.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.123
I know Kate
wouldn't tell anyone.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.658
You didn't tell anyone,
did you, Kate?

11:33.660 --> 11:34.993
Of course not.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.561
Kate didn't tell anyone.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.997
Well, somebody told
the Metcalfs, the Polmanskis

So the next time that you want
to drag somebody's dirty laundry

11:52.045 --> 11:54.379
through the suburban mud,
try your own.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.980

12:04.024 --> 12:06.658

12:10.831 --> 12:13.465
I'm going to the garage now.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.267

with the town crier.

the Logans and the Kogans?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.276
What was the question?

13:00.981 --> 13:04.382
Before I pull every hair
out of your neck

13:06.286 --> 13:08.253
I wanna ask you something.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.155
Did you call those people

13:10.157 --> 13:13.024
and tell them about
Trevor and Raquel?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.492
I decline to answer
on the grounds

13:14.494 --> 13:16.661
that I need my neck hair.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.732
Just mind your own business,
ALF!

13:20.734 --> 13:23.301
In other words, you
disapprove of what I've done?

13:24.271 --> 13:26.838
Wholeheartedly.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.341
I know that this is
an inconvenience for all of us

13:30.343 --> 13:33.611
but what you're doing
is just making things worse.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.348
You're right, Willie.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.718
How could I have been so blind?

13:40.720 --> 13:44.055
You know, I've only
been thinking of myself.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.356
You're not just saying this

13:45.358 --> 13:47.759
because of that
neck hair business?

13:47.761 --> 13:49.828
No. No, I mean it.

13:49.830 --> 13:55.233
I've seen the error of my ways
and will endeavor to do better.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.436
Well, thank you.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.072
No. Thank you, Willie.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.440
Thank you.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.800
Hello. Uh, I'd like
to order some flowers

14:28.802 --> 14:31.269

- Well, he is now, but I--

15:09.009 --> 15:10.475
Drop it!

15:12.913 --> 15:18.816
Willie, did you know that
there are 9875 little dots

15:18.818 --> 15:21.185
on this ceiling?

15:21.187 --> 15:24.522
- You counted them?
- No, I guessed.

'Hey, Tanner, you in there?'

15:26.526 --> 15:29.360
Oh, yeah. Just a second.

you think you're clever.'

15:47.147 --> 15:49.647
What's the idea sending
these flowers to my wife?

15:49.649 --> 15:53.217
- Oh, what's the matter, Trevor?
- Don't play innocent with me.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.286
You thought by not
sending a card

15:55.288 --> 15:56.854
I wouldn't know
who they were from.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.823
Oh, wait a minute,
if there was no card

15:58.825 --> 16:00.458
what makes you think
they were from me?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.026
I called the florist.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.829
He said they were charged
to your credit card!

16:04.831 --> 16:09.033
Anybody who would spend 79.95
on another man's wife

16:09.035 --> 16:12.704
plus tax and delivery
is lookin' for trouble.

16:13.974 --> 16:19.944
There must be..
79.95.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.380
Plus tax and delivery.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.616
There must be some mistake.

16:25.618 --> 16:29.520
Hey, Tanner, the only mistake
I made was trusting you.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.457
If I ever catch you
near my wife again

16:32.459 --> 16:34.559
I'm movin' out of your house.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.804
Is there a chance that
you heard any of that?

16:47.807 --> 16:50.074
[laughs]
Well, I've heard enough.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.977
Does Kate know
you have a thing for Raquel?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.584
You sent those flowers,
didn't you?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.652
Hey, I took a shot.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.054
It obviously didn't work

17:03.056 --> 17:05.256
but I've got
another plan that's foolproof.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.492
Stay out of this!

17:09.763 --> 17:11.329
Entire!

17:11.331 --> 17:13.564
I'm just going now.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.234
Uh, I-I'm going to try
and straighten things out

17:16.236 --> 17:17.602
with Trevor
and when I come back

17:17.604 --> 17:19.904
we'll be talking neck hair.

- Hi, ALF.
- Hi.

17:24.677 --> 17:28.146
We gotta find a way to get
my aunt and uncle back together.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.548
Too late, Jake.
I can't help ya.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.484
I promised Willie
I'd stay out of it.

Fine, fine,
j-just stand on the sidelines

17:36.256 --> 17:38.256

bunch of itinerant Ochmoneks

17:41.494 --> 17:44.062

17:44.064 --> 17:46.064
Believe it or not,
Aunt Raquel and Uncle Trevor

17:46.066 --> 17:48.933
are the best of the lot.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.003
Are you trying to con me
into helping you?

17:52.005 --> 17:54.072
Is it workin'?

17:54.074 --> 17:55.306
Sort of.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.843
What will it take
to put you over the top?

17:58.845 --> 18:01.245
- Donuts.
- What's your idea?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.982
You come up with donuts,
I'll come up with the idea.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.050
That's the deal.

and I'll tell ya.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.894
Tell me first.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.197
What are we doin'
in my aunt and uncle's bedroom?

18:19.199 --> 18:24.469
We're looking for a key
to their romantic past, if any.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.604
Are you sure Raquel
won't be back soon?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.439
She went to the beauty parlor.

and uncle had so much class.

Hey, there might be
somethin' romantic in here.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.593

Just tell me what
we're looking for.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.201
I'll tell you
when I've found it.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.037
I think I found it.

It's Aunt Raquel. Look, you stay
here, I'll get rid of her.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.848
Fine. Leave the donuts.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.417

what happened to you?

19:25.265 --> 19:28.799
- I went to the beauty parlor.
- I hope you didn't leave a tip.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.271
Mrs. Byrd and I had
a slight altercation.

That hussy was getting
gussied up for my husband.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.276

So got in a fight with her?

19:38.278 --> 19:39.644

19:41.114 --> 19:43.080
she keep her meat hooks
off of my man.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.715
And if the manicurist
hadn't pulled me off her

I might have gotten
in a few more suggestions.

'Of course, on the bed.'

what is the matter with you?

19:54.661 --> 19:58.095

not understand me.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.920

held hostage by a terrorist.

It's a crumpled piece of paper
with writing on it.

Uncle Trevor wrote to me

our wedding vows.

Don't you know how long
it took me to write that?

21:22.315 --> 21:26.083
You didn't write that.
It's from a song by Chicago.

a long time to write it down.

write this poem.

Then why didn't you call me
on it?

21:37.864 --> 21:39.297
Because it didn't matter.

What mattered was
is that you gave it to me.
