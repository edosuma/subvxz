we could get much information.'

on the scanners?

Not yet. They're at

01:00.500 --> 01:03.083
Alright, people,
we don't have confirmation yet

01:03.167 --> 01:06.125
but this may be the Scout Fleet
the Gaim warned us about.

01:06.208 --> 01:09.292
Apparently, they're the advanced
wing of a hostile alien force

01:09.375 --> 01:13.333
that's scouting out this sector
for likely worlds to invade.

01:13.417 --> 01:16.417

they either don't leave here'

01:19.208 --> 01:22.792

are neither soft nor vulnerable'

01:22.875 --> 01:25.000
and way too much
trouble to invade.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.667
We win this battle,
they go away

01:26.750 --> 01:29.542
we save ourselves a great deal
of trouble in the future.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.917
We lose, this'll get
a hell of a lot worse.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.042
Let's get ready.

01:35.125 --> 01:37.667
I want all civilian traffic
moved out of the area.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.333
President Sheridan
been notified yet?

01:39.417 --> 01:41.667
As soon as we got the signal.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.500
I want a life pod set aside
for him and Delenn

01:43.583 --> 01:45.167
in case things
get out of control.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.250
He won't leave.
Neither will Delenn.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.917
Oh, leave that to me.
I'll talk to them.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.917
If I have to personally knock
them out and stick them in a pod

01:53.000 --> 01:55.125
I'll do it.
Just get it ready.

- Yep.

02:42.542 --> 02:43.875
Third one this month.

02:43.958 --> 02:46.583
Seems like every week something
goes wrong around here.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.333
And we have to clean it up.

02:49.417 --> 02:50.833
Never think about that part,
now do they?

02:50.917 --> 02:53.750
No. Probably never even
crosses their minds.

02:53.833 --> 02:56.000
You got that right.
Wonder what this one's about?

02:56.083 --> 02:59.000
Don't know. Guess we'll
find out in a little bit.

Sir, we don't know what
we're getting into here.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.500
We have no information
on the disposition

04:44.583 --> 04:45.708
of the enemy forces

04:45.792 --> 04:47.167
their weapons,
their relative strengths

04:47.250 --> 04:48.583
and all the White Stars
are out on missions.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.375
- They won't get back--
- I understand.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.542
No, sir, I don't think you do.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.417
Now my job is to protect
you and to protect this station.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.542
- Not necessarily in that order.
- That part I understand.

04:58.625 --> 05:00.375
I can't do my job
protecting the station

05:00.458 --> 05:02.042
if I have to worry
about you two.

05:02.125 --> 05:05.875
Just give me a little peace
of mind on the one front, sir.

05:05.958 --> 05:09.042

to take care of all the rest.

were reversed..'

The same.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.667
So you will link up
to the life pod?

05:18.750 --> 05:20.167
And we'll know your
whereabouts at all times?

05:20.250 --> 05:22.292
I'll do what I can.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.208
Mr. President, it's vital..

05:25.958 --> 05:27.833
- You hear that, Bo?
- Yep.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.375
That's why I like Sheridan.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.000
Always have.

05:31.083 --> 05:32.583
A lot of these bigwigs

05:32.667 --> 05:35.417
ah, they're only worried about
protecting their own skin.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.417
Sheridan, he's down in the
trenches with everybody else.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.792
He is that. You know, one day
I was working Grey sector

05:40.875 --> 05:43.417
and he came running after
this guy that stabbed Delenn.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.250
You could see it in his eyes.
He was ready to kill this guy.

05:46.333 --> 05:49.000
Anybody else would have just
let security take care of it.

05:49.083 --> 05:52.167
But Sheridan chased him down
and put him down so hard

05:52.250 --> 05:54.083
the guy didn't get up
for three days.

05:54.167 --> 05:57.917
[chuckles]
Oh, you've seen him and Delenn
together, right, huh?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.208
Now that's true love,
my friend.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.250
- You don't see that very often.
- Very true.

06:02.333 --> 06:05.000
- He's a good man.
- Yep. Good man.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.167
I heard he was dead once.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.667
Yeah, well,
nobody's perfect, Bo.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.000
Hey, Mack, can I
ask you a question?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.208
Shoot.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.750
What the hell are
these things for?

06:17.833 --> 06:18.750
What do you mean?

06:18.833 --> 06:20.542
I mean, what do they do?

06:20.625 --> 06:22.667
Oh, what do you mean,
what do they do?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.958
You run 'em along the floor
like this.

06:25.042 --> 06:28.625
Okay. So what does it do?
It's not any cleaner.

06:28.708 --> 06:30.792
[sighs]
I don't know.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.292
Maybe it looks for cracks or
it does something to the metal

06:33.375 --> 06:35.083
makes it stronger,
I don't know.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.625
So you don't know
what it does either?

06:36.708 --> 06:38.208
No.

06:38.292 --> 06:39.333
Well..

06:41.917 --> 06:44.083
- Guess it's time for lunch.
- Yep.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.458
- What you got there?
- Hard salami.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.083
Hey, hey, hey, hard salami?

06:59.167 --> 07:00.750
How the hell did you get
hard salami up here?

07:00.833 --> 07:02.000
- I know a guy.
- Yeah, well, well..

07:02.083 --> 07:03.625
Introduce me sometime, okay?

07:03.708 --> 07:06.042
I'm a little tired
of the same old, same old.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.500
I'm a little desperate here.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.583
I can tell.
What is that stuff?

07:09.667 --> 07:11.667
Well, it's this spoo
everybody's talking about.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.333
Oh, the Centauri love it.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.917
Ten credits an ounce

07:16.000 --> 07:17.042
And what's it taste like?

07:17.125 --> 07:19.542
[sighs]
It's hard to say, Bo.

07:20.750 --> 07:24.333
Um, kind of, um,
spoo-ish, I guess.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.042
No. you're supposed
to say chicken.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.542
- Huh?
- 'That's the joke.'

07:27.625 --> 07:29.583
Whenever you eat something
strange and someone asks

07:29.667 --> 07:32.167
what's it taste like,
you're supposed to say chicken.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.125
- It's funny that way.
- It doesn't taste like chicken.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.333
Okay.

07:39.458 --> 07:42.333
- Okay, never mind.
- Want half?

07:42.417 --> 07:44.792
- Trade you for the hard salami.
- I don't know--

07:44.875 --> 07:46.958
Ah, come on, Bo, be a guy.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.792
Oh, man.

07:59.875 --> 08:02.042
This stuff is awful.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.208
At ten credits an ounce
if you can believe that.

08:04.292 --> 08:07.208
- The Centauri love it?
- Oh, they go nuts for it.

stands straight up.

with the Isolab.

is only giving us

08:52.583 --> 08:53.750
standard atmosphere options.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.667
Now we need to customize
the system on the fly.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.000
System's probably locked up.

I 'll get it back on line.

on standby ready to adapt

to whatever comes in.
Alright? Let's go to work.

of life forms we're in for.

hard to prepare.

Whoever they are,
whatever they are

09:27.625 --> 09:29.417
they're coming here
to kill us.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.833
If I see one of 'em floppin'
on the deck, gasping for air

09:31.917 --> 09:33.458
I'm gonna let him buy it.

09:34.792 --> 09:38.250
Well, that's your choice.
I don't agree.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.292
Why not?

09:40.375 --> 09:41.625
Why not?

09:45.042 --> 09:48.250
You know, some days,
I wonder the same thing.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.417
Sometimes it's like no one else
is playing by the rules

09:50.500 --> 09:52.042
so why should we, right?

09:53.417 --> 09:55.917
It does take it out of you
after a while, believe me.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.083
Even so.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.333
Now, see, the thing is I wasn't
always gonna be a doctor.

10:05.417 --> 10:07.833
My father is career military
just like his dad

10:07.917 --> 10:09.667
and his dad before him.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.333
So it was just understood

10:12.417 --> 10:14.958
that I would go the same way.

10:15.042 --> 10:17.292
I even bought into it myself.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.167
And then one day, I..

10:21.375 --> 10:23.667
You remember what happened
to the Ares?

10:23.750 --> 10:27.167
Yeah, yeah, that was
right before the Dilgar War.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.125
We got caught in the middle
of a civil war between

10:29.208 --> 10:31.208
two midrange colonies.

10:31.292 --> 10:34.583
Ares was shot down
and captured by enemy forces.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.875
My father was first officer
on the Ares.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.917
And when that ship went down,
we were told that there wasn't

10:40.000 --> 10:42.375
much chance
anybody would survive

10:42.458 --> 10:45.583
or that any survivors would be
allowed to live by the enemy.

10:47.292 --> 10:51.375
It took almost two months for
our forces to retake that base.

10:53.292 --> 10:56.167
I remember watching ISN when
they opened up the enemy base

10:56.250 --> 10:58.875
and three injured soldiers
came out.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.083
One of them was my father.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.708
'The base doctor
had kept him alive'

11:03.792 --> 11:05.875
over the objections
of the CO because he believed

11:05.958 --> 11:08.958
that life was sacred
and had to be preserved.

11:10.958 --> 11:13.750
When I saw him walk out,
supported by the doctor

11:13.833 --> 11:18.083
I knew right then that's what
I wanted to do with my life.

11:18.167 --> 11:20.542
Of course, my father,
he wasn't too happy about it

11:20.625 --> 11:22.583
but he always said

11:22.667 --> 11:25.333
we had to go our own way.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.708
So I did.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.208
So when this is all over

11:30.292 --> 11:32.583
I'll be out there looking
for anybody I can save

11:32.667 --> 11:36.750
on our side or theirs,
because that's what I do.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.958
That's what I would
want them to do for me..

11:40.042 --> 11:41.208
...or for you.

11:43.542 --> 11:47.583
So I, uh, need those
atmospherics back online.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.833
- You'll have it.
- Alright.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.167
- Hey, doc.
- Yeah?

11:53.250 --> 11:56.083
So what happened to the doctor
that helped your dad?

11:58.042 --> 12:00.000
Shot and killed
by his own men.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.792
Said he was a traitor.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.292
[indistinct announcement]

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.875
It was working fine
a moment ago

12:22.958 --> 12:24.583
and then the wiring
just shorted out.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.833
- Yeah, let me take a look.
- Status?

12:27.917 --> 12:30.125
We're working on the secondary
targeting console.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.667
Primaries are still online.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.458
We read three scout vessels
ahead of the main assault group.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.833
Well, we can't let any of them
get back to the main group.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.792
- Make sure that--
- 'Here they come.'

12:42.375 --> 12:43.958
[firing]

12:50.375 --> 12:52.375
I can't get a lock.
They're going fast.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.167
(Corwin)
They're coming around.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.667
Delta wing moving to intercept.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.167
Defense grid, prepare to fire.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.792
Defense grid, aye.
Primaries locking on.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.375
Fire.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.708
[gunfire]

13:07.792 --> 13:10.500
- 'Splash bogey one.'
- 'Target locked at bogey two.'

13:10.583 --> 13:12.333
[gunfire]

13:21.458 --> 13:22.917
(Corwin)
'Direct hit on bogey two.'

13:24.708 --> 13:26.750
They're scanning us, trying to
access our defense information.

13:26.833 --> 13:27.833
Scramble all the codes.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.167
If we scramble the codes
we won't

13:29.250 --> 13:30.167
be able to use the system--

13:30.250 --> 13:31.375
If they download our codes

13:31.458 --> 13:32.708
the main fleet can shut us down.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.625
- Scramble those codes.
- Aye, captain.

13:34.708 --> 13:37.083
Ah, there's your problem.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.958
[explosion]

13:41.042 --> 13:42.833
(Corwin)
'She's making a run for it.'

13:42.917 --> 13:45.083
All fighters, I want that ship.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.375
(Corwin)
'She's outrunning them.'

13:46.458 --> 13:48.750
'Out of range
of the primary weapons system.'

13:48.833 --> 13:51.625
- Ah, there you go.
- 'Secondary's back on line.'

13:51.708 --> 13:53.375
Fire.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.875
[gunfire]

13:59.000 --> 14:01.083
(Mack)
Yeah, that's your problem.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.958
Had a bunch of these come in
on a food transport

14:03.042 --> 14:04.500
about a year ago.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.958
Always getting in the wiring.

14:07.042 --> 14:08.417
Lieutenant, status?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.750
Defense grid
fully operational, captain.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.208
Good.

14:12.292 --> 14:14.083
Because that was only
a taste of what's coming.

14:14.167 --> 14:17.500
Just enough to soften us up
and scout out the area.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.833
The rest of them
won't be far behind.

14:19.917 --> 14:22.167
We're in serious guano
here, lieutenant.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.583
Better alert the ambassadors

14:23.667 --> 14:25.792
and go through emergency
evac procedures.

14:25.875 --> 14:26.917
Understood.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.250
While you do that,
I'm gonna go have

14:28.333 --> 14:31.000
a little talk
with Mr. Garibaldi.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.875
Hey, how'd it go?

14:48.958 --> 14:51.208
- Another B15.
- In C&amp;C?

14:51.292 --> 14:53.000
Oh, man, we're gonna catch
hell for that one.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.542
Damned crawlers
are all over the place.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.083
- Can you hand me that R-12?
- Yeah.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.333
So you get a chance
to see the new captain?

15:01.417 --> 15:04.125
- Yeah.
- What do you think?

15:04.208 --> 15:06.708
- Tastes like--
- Don't go there.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.792
[chuckles]
Okay.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.625
Hey, one thing's for sure.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.125
If I needed somebody
to watch my back in a fight

15:13.208 --> 15:16.833
I'd pick her.
Oh, she's tough. She's smart.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.750
I'm just glad she's on my side.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.000
Yeah, maybe.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.583
- 'What do you mean?'
- Nothing.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.500
No, no, no, no, come on,
come on, come on, you said it.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.167
Uh, you must have
meant somethin'.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.292
- You just hear things, rumors.
- Like what?

15:29.917 --> 15:31.958
Well, back when we were
fighting Earth

15:32.042 --> 15:33.833
trying to get rid
of President Clark

15:33.917 --> 15:36.375
scuttlebutt is she was on
the wrong side of the fight.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.042
Yeah, well, so were
a lot of people.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.917
A lot of them followed orders
because they had to.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.583
And some of them followed them
because they wanted to.

15:43.667 --> 15:47.208
- So what are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

15:47.292 --> 15:49.708
You asked me what the rumor was
and I told you.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.500
You shouldn't listen
to rumors, Bo.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.458
This place is full of them.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.417
Like, when Ivanova left, I..

15:57.500 --> 16:01.583
Everywhere I turned, somebody
had an opinion on that one.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.750
One guy said that she left
because she was heartbroken

16:03.833 --> 16:06.208
over that guy, uh,
that guy, um, um--

16:06.292 --> 16:08.125
- Marcus.
- Marcus. Right, right.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.875
Then somebody else said
that she wanted a promotion.

16:10.958 --> 16:13.417
Quit because she wasn't
getting paid enough money.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.083
So which is it?

16:18.167 --> 16:20.375
Ah, what difference
does it make?

16:20.458 --> 16:23.708
That's the military life.
People come, people go.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.542
It's nobody else's business.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.208
If I shouldn't
listen to rumors

16:27.292 --> 16:30.250
then why the hell did you ask me
to tell you what they were?

16:30.333 --> 16:32.375
I just like to stay informed,
that's all.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.208
Brown 9.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.375
Oh, man, we got
Brown sector again?

16:43.458 --> 16:44.833
I know. I know.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.875
I thought Del Rey was working
Brown sector today.

16:46.958 --> 16:48.792
Del Rey's down sick, he--

16:48.875 --> 16:50.792
- Oh, damn it, captain.
- Blue 7.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.167
I need all the information.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.417
How the hell was
I supposed to know that

16:53.500 --> 16:54.833
they could download
our tactical system?

16:54.917 --> 16:57.208
You're supposed to be
head of covert intelligence.

16:57.292 --> 16:59.500
Well, right now, I'm not seeing
a hell of a lot of intelligence

16:59.583 --> 17:01.083
covert, overt or otherwise.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.167
The Gaim didn't say anything
about that part.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.542
- When his people got hit--
- Did you ask him?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.375
No, I didn't ask them
if they could scan us.

17:07.458 --> 17:08.583
I also didn't ask 'em
if they could

17:08.667 --> 17:10.208
wax the hull or deliver pizza.

17:10.292 --> 17:12.250
Now some of the questions I
think about and some I don't.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.333
You can't think
of every possible question.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.833
That's the nature of your job,
Mr. Garibaldi.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.250
If you can't handle it
I'll tell

17:18.333 --> 17:20.875
president Sheridan
to find someone who can.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.042
Meanwhile, I suggest
you go back to the Gaim

17:23.125 --> 17:26.083
and think up all those questions
you didn't think up before

17:26.167 --> 17:28.708
because we have an assault fleet
on the way here, mister

17:28.792 --> 17:30.792
and I'd like to have
at least a fighting chance

17:30.875 --> 17:32.708
of surviving the next 12 hours.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.708
Well, trust me,
the odds on that

17:39.792 --> 17:41.708
are pretty damn small
right about now.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.500
Pizza sounds good.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.125
Nah, can't get
good pizza up here.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.625
- I know a guy.
- Ah, here we go again.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.250
(Mack)
'I really hate it
down here, Bo.'

18:10.375 --> 18:11.917
- 'The crawlers?'
- Yeah.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.542
They've been in here too,
but that ain't the problem.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.375
Looks like we've had
seepage from the water

18:16.458 --> 18:18.292
reprocessing system again.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.667
They keep tapping pipes
for fresh

18:21.750 --> 18:23.625
and they never close 'em up
right again.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.875
- Hand me those pliers.
- Sure.

18:27.042 --> 18:29.208
You know, I was wondering

18:29.292 --> 18:31.167
why don't they just
shut down the jump gate

18:31.250 --> 18:33.083
when this sort of thing happens?

18:33.167 --> 18:34.458
When what happens?

18:34.542 --> 18:35.667
Well, the captain was saying

18:35.750 --> 18:38.208
something about an alien fleet.

18:38.292 --> 18:39.417
Here you go.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.958
'They can't just
shut down the gate.'

18:41.042 --> 18:43.125
Thing takes four,
five days to heat up

18:43.208 --> 18:44.833
and two days just to shut down.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.875
Any faster and boom.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.833
There's an awful lot of power
in those things, Mack.

18:48.917 --> 18:50.500
An awful lot.

18:50.583 --> 18:53.208
Besides, if things get hot,
you don't wanna close off

18:53.292 --> 18:54.458
your only route
of escape out of here.

18:54.542 --> 18:55.708
Yeah.

18:55.792 --> 18:56.792
[beep]

18:58.625 --> 19:00.042
This is Mack.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.833
(male #3)
'You guys take care
of that M-17?'

19:01.917 --> 19:03.292
Just finished, boss.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.042
'Okay, you'd better get down
to the sanctuary.'

19:05.125 --> 19:07.667
'They need the place prepped
for some religious ceremony.'

19:07.750 --> 19:09.125
Headin' out.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.125
They never give us
a break around here.

19:14.208 --> 19:15.625
Amen.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.083
We are strongly urging
all residents

19:20.167 --> 19:21.208
to stay in your quarters

19:21.292 --> 19:23.125
until the current crisis
has passed.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.500
The first wing of the attack
is coming through.

19:25.583 --> 19:28.042
I repeat, the first wing
is coming through.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.167
[gunfire]

19:47.125 --> 19:49.375
(Mack)
Maintenance, this is Mackie.

19:49.458 --> 19:50.708
We're finished in here.

19:50.792 --> 19:53.083
Going on break for a bit
unless you need us.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.167
(male #3)
'Uh, negative.
you're clear for now.'

20:00.500 --> 20:02.292
[sighing]

20:04.167 --> 20:06.125
Almost pretty, isn't it?

20:06.208 --> 20:08.167
Yeah, I suppose it is.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.750
Sometimes it's easy to forget

20:10.833 --> 20:13.000
those are our guys
fighting out there.

20:13.083 --> 20:16.125
All you see is the light,
the color.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.625
When you see red,
that's one of ours going up.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.625
The green,
that's the other guys.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.208
How can you tell?

20:22.292 --> 20:24.042
You can't have an explosion,
you can't have fire

20:24.125 --> 20:26.250
unless you have some kind
of atmosphere in the ship.

20:26.333 --> 20:29.042
Our guys use oxygen,
so when the fuel core blows

20:29.125 --> 20:30.625
it lights up red.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.625
Those other guys must use
some other atmosphere.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.042
I don't know,
carbon monoxide, somethin'.

20:35.125 --> 20:38.333
So when the thing blows,
it's different, green.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.792
You figure this out
all by yourself, did you?

20:40.875 --> 20:42.167
Asked one of the pilots
the other day.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.375
He told me all about it.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.417
Most of them act like
we don't exist.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.417
Yeah. Hotshots.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.458
Yeah, but this one was okay.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.375
Probably out there right now.

20:55.583 --> 20:58.125
Hey, that was a red one.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.333
- When did you get religious?
- I'm not.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.625
Just respect, that's all.

21:07.708 --> 21:09.833
Every time we get a little
red star born out there

21:09.917 --> 21:11.667
somebody's life ends.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.917
All they ever were gonna be,
all they were

21:15.000 --> 21:18.875
all the people they knew,
all the people they loved

21:18.958 --> 21:21.167
it's all gone.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.542
They're fighting for us, Mack.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.458
Don't ever forget that.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.375
Hey, hey, take a look.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.542
[gunfire]

21:36.750 --> 21:38.917
Yeah! Yeah!

21:39.000 --> 21:40.458
One of the White Stars.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.292
Captain said they wouldn't be
back for a while yet.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.708
I guess this baby was a little
closer to home than the others.

21:44.792 --> 21:47.792
- Sure looks pretty.
- You think?

21:47.875 --> 21:49.417
Hell, yeah.
What do you think?

21:49.500 --> 21:52.875
Nah. I always thought they
looked like plucked chickens.

21:52.958 --> 21:54.292
- What?
- Hey, look..

21:54.375 --> 21:56.500
It's not my fault
they were designed that way.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.375
Uh-oh. Look.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.375
That's a breaching pod.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.708
Looks like we're gonna
have us some guests.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.250
(Corwin)
'Attention, all residents.'

22:09.333 --> 22:11.750
'You are advised to move
to the shelters at once.'

22:11.833 --> 22:12.958
'We are being boarded.'

22:13.042 --> 22:16.417
'I repeat, all personnel
to the shelters.'

22:16.500 --> 22:18.417
You heard the man.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.542
[alarm beeping]

22:35.750 --> 22:38.000
Computer, Blue 3.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.625
Come on, Blue 3.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.292
- The system's shorted out.
- Oh, great.

22:42.375 --> 22:44.708
Let's just hope
we're not between levels.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.708
Manual override.

22:46.792 --> 22:48.042
[gunfire]

22:48.125 --> 22:50.417
Get down, get down.
Close it up, close it up.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.583
I can't. Get out of here.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.125
[gunfire]

22:59.958 --> 23:00.958
Holy..

23:04.625 --> 23:06.542
[indistinct shouting]

23:09.417 --> 23:11.417
[grunts]

23:38.208 --> 23:40.542
What the hell are you guys
doing here? Get out of here.

23:40.625 --> 23:42.542
We'll cover you. Go on.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.417
Cover.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.708
- Hey, Bo.
- Yeah?

23:50.792 --> 23:53.542
- Next time we walk, man.
- I'm with you!

24:02.958 --> 24:04.625
[panting]

24:13.042 --> 24:14.625
You're safe.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.625
I suggest you remain here
until the fighting stops.

24:17.708 --> 24:20.208
Yeah, but the fighting's
right outside.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.333
Nonetheless, it is safe.

24:33.958 --> 24:35.750
A fellow of infinite jest.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.042
I knew him, Horatio.

24:40.292 --> 24:42.875
It's, uh, Mack actually.

24:42.958 --> 24:46.417
This is Bo.
You knew this guy?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.583
After the fact.

24:48.667 --> 24:51.542
He was killed
just outside that door.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.417
His helmet rolled in here
and stopped

24:53.500 --> 24:56.083
just where you're sitting.

24:56.167 --> 24:59.458
At the moment of death,
there is a passing of energy.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.042
An explosion of consciousness.

25:03.125 --> 25:06.417
It permeates everything
in close proximity.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.458
Your clothes,
jewelry, anything.

25:11.958 --> 25:14.458
We can still feel him.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.875
What he was, what he did.

25:18.167 --> 25:23.250
His hopes and fears
and expectations.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.000
It's still there
for a few minutes.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.500
Then it will disappear..

25:31.583 --> 25:34.167
...joining him in silence.

25:34.250 --> 25:36.000
Telepaths.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.417
The telepaths we heard about.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.125
The ones that Sheridan
let live down here.

25:40.208 --> 25:42.083
Oh. Yeah, well.

25:42.167 --> 25:44.458
Uh, we don't get assigned
to Brown sector much anymore.

25:44.542 --> 25:48.417
Uh, it's mainly the new guys
who get stuck with it.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.625
Uh, I didn't mean
anything by that.

25:56.708 --> 25:59.417
It's just that we didn't, uh..

25:59.500 --> 26:01.458
Uh..

26:01.542 --> 26:03.042
Shouldn't you folks
be in a shelter?

26:03.125 --> 26:05.292
It's a lot less dangerous.

26:07.625 --> 26:09.958
[dramatic music]

26:36.417 --> 26:37.833
Though cruel and capricious

26:37.917 --> 26:40.875
bringing us into a world
that fears us and hates us

26:40.958 --> 26:44.042
nature did not leave us
entirely without protection.

26:46.375 --> 26:47.375
Yeah.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.875
Uh, yeah, maybe,
so, uh, we should go.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.542
Yeah, we should go.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.167
[rumbling]

26:55.250 --> 26:58.417
Oh, man, this close
to the hull.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.500
I mean, you really feel it
when we take a hit.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.000
You know, this thing goes on
much longer, Bo

27:03.083 --> 27:05.542
and, uh, we're gonna
have a breach.

27:05.625 --> 27:09.042
It's okay.
Our guys will handle them.

27:09.125 --> 27:10.542
Do you think so?

27:10.625 --> 27:12.625
They're the best pilots
in the sector.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.375
I just wish I was
out there with them.

27:16.458 --> 27:18.292
- Do you?
- Yeah.

27:19.375 --> 27:21.417
- Sincerely?
- Bo.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.167
Yeah, I sincerely do.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.625
Tell me that it matters to you.

27:28.708 --> 27:30.375
Bo, I don't..

27:30.458 --> 27:32.625
Yes, it matters to me.

27:32.708 --> 27:33.875
Why?

27:40.333 --> 27:42.042
What the hell?

27:42.125 --> 27:44.167
[indistinct chatter]

27:58.458 --> 28:00.625
[gunfire]

28:04.000 --> 28:05.583
(Mack)
Bo.

28:06.750 --> 28:09.250
Bo, Bo, you okay?

28:10.167 --> 28:12.958
'I'd, uh, i-it's quiet outside.'

28:13.042 --> 28:16.208
'Uh, the fighting seems
to have moved down the hall.'

28:18.500 --> 28:20.250
I think we should be going
while we can.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.458
Yeah.

28:24.083 --> 28:25.542
Goodbye.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.542
[gunfire]

28:41.375 --> 28:43.875
(Londo)
My life here.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.125
'Argh.'

28:45.208 --> 28:48.500
'Absolutely intolerable.
Completely inexcusable.'

28:48.583 --> 28:50.792
'You would think we would be
beyond this sort of thing'

28:50.875 --> 28:53.167
by now, wouldn't you?

28:53.250 --> 28:54.792
And whose idea was it

28:54.875 --> 28:57.750
to send the White Stars away
at a time like this?

28:57.833 --> 28:59.417
They are still returning
from guarding

28:59.500 --> 29:02.250
the Enfili homeworld, Mollari,
as you well know.

29:02.333 --> 29:04.750
I wasn't talking to you.

29:04.833 --> 29:07.375
I was talking to the universe.

29:07.458 --> 29:08.958
The universe.

29:09.042 --> 29:11.125
The universe hates me, you know.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.458
I don't know why.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.500
I have never done anything

29:13.583 --> 29:15.708
to the universe to, uh..

29:17.125 --> 29:18.750
Well, alright, a few things

29:18.833 --> 29:21.583
but after a while, you would
think it would be enough.

29:21.667 --> 29:24.333
Yes, we have had
our, our little fun

29:24.417 --> 29:26.667
with Londo Mollari for now.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.458
Perhaps it is time to move on

29:28.542 --> 29:31.042
and find someone else
to play with.

29:35.625 --> 29:38.458
You seem rather calm
about all of this, hmm?

29:39.833 --> 29:42.000
When I was a child,
your people decided

29:42.083 --> 29:46.000
that the rebellion by my people
needed to be discouraged.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.958
So your people bombed
seven of our major cities

29:49.042 --> 29:51.917
for six straight days,
31 hours a day.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.250
You thought you could
bomb us into submission.

29:54.333 --> 29:58.458
It didn't work then
and it didn't work later.

29:58.542 --> 30:02.125
We spent our days in shelters
we made ourselves.

30:02.208 --> 30:04.042
We sang songs.

30:04.125 --> 30:07.458
We prayed.
We ate, we slept.

30:07.542 --> 30:10.667
I spent my life in one
such shelter or another.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.875
I will tell you
the truth, Mollari.

30:12.958 --> 30:16.833
This is probably
the closest thing I have..

30:16.917 --> 30:19.458
...to a home.

30:19.542 --> 30:23.042
Yes, well, uh,
don't start singing.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.250
You'll frighten the children.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.125
We have enough misery
to deal with as it is.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.583
We don't need to add more.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.583
And where did you
grow up, Mollari?

30:32.750 --> 30:33.542
What?

30:33.625 --> 30:35.833
It was a simple enough question.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.583
While I was sitting
in a bomb shelter

30:37.667 --> 30:39.500
learning to hate your people

30:39.583 --> 30:41.875
where were you spending
your time as a child?

30:41.958 --> 30:43.500
Playing in the imperial gardens

30:43.583 --> 30:46.458
learning Centauri table manners?

30:48.208 --> 30:51.083
I was never a child.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.667
I had responsibilities.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.958
I've had responsibilities
for as long as I can remember.

30:56.042 --> 30:59.708
Duty, honor, family.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.750
Ah.

31:01.833 --> 31:04.083
That explains a great deal.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.292
Really?

31:05.375 --> 31:08.250
And what exactly
does it explain, G'Kar?

31:08.333 --> 31:11.417
I spent my years
in one shelter after another

31:11.500 --> 31:15.750
but sooner or later, I was
able to leave the shelter

31:15.833 --> 31:17.833
and walk out into the daylight.

31:19.167 --> 31:21.083
You do not have that luxury.

31:21.167 --> 31:25.042
You carry your shelter
with you every day.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.958
You did not grow up.

31:28.042 --> 31:29.583
You grew old.

31:31.917 --> 31:35.042
I think I will see how
things are going out there.

31:35.125 --> 31:36.792
I'll go too. Good idea.

31:38.958 --> 31:41.292
What, are you afraid
I won't come back, G'Kar?

31:42.250 --> 31:44.417
No, afraid you will.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.000
[explosion]

31:51.083 --> 31:53.833
So how long you figure
they've been married?

31:53.917 --> 31:55.333
(man on PA system)
'Attention, all personnel.'

31:55.417 --> 31:57.125
'The second wave is coming
through the gate.'

31:57.208 --> 31:59.792
'Repeat, the second wave
is coming through.'

32:09.583 --> 32:11.708
[gunfire]

32:19.292 --> 32:20.875
[gunfire]

32:35.542 --> 32:37.625
[beep]

32:37.708 --> 32:40.500
- Yeah?
- 'All hands needed on Red 1.'

32:40.583 --> 32:42.833
'We have fires on the deck
burning in from the hull.'

32:42.917 --> 32:45.083
On our way. Let's go.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.125
Yeah, alright. Alright.

33:00.958 --> 33:03.292
Where's that support?
Get it up here now.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.000
- Delenn, listen to me.
- No.

33:12.083 --> 33:13.667
You have to get on the life pod.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.083
I refuse to leave.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.500
That's what I said to Lochley
and I was wrong.

33:17.583 --> 33:19.083
Now this isn't
going well, Delenn.

33:19.167 --> 33:20.542
I need to know
that you are safe.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.333
- John, I--
- You two.

33:23.542 --> 33:25.250
Do you know where
the life pods are?

33:25.333 --> 33:26.292
Yes, sir.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.417
Escort Ambassador Delenn
there at once.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.208
- But, sir, we were told--
- 'Doesn't matter.'

33:30.292 --> 33:32.292
I need everyone in security
on the firing line

33:32.375 --> 33:33.417
and that leaves you.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.208
See to it she gets there safely

33:35.292 --> 33:36.583
and gets on the first
available pod.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.667
- Yes, sir.
- Now go on.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.833
Hey, look, with luck,
the rest of the White Stars

33:41.917 --> 33:44.458
will get here on time
and we won't even need the pods.

33:44.542 --> 33:48.083
What if we do?
What if the station falls?

33:48.167 --> 33:49.750
Then as you said to me once..

33:51.125 --> 33:54.583
...I'll see you again in the
place where no shadows fall.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.333
Go on.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.625
Ma'am?

34:20.708 --> 34:21.875
Ambassador.

34:23.167 --> 34:25.208
The pods are this way.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.333
- What is your name?
- Ma'am?

34:42.417 --> 34:44.583
That was not
a difficult question.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.333
No, it's just..

34:48.417 --> 34:50.125
Well, folks at your level..

34:50.208 --> 34:52.042
I mean, uh..

34:52.125 --> 34:53.750
We don't get asked
that a lot, ma'am.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.750
We just get orders.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.875
My name is Mack
and this is Bo.

34:58.958 --> 35:00.417
We're kind of a team.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.292
Floaters, I guess
you could say.

35:02.375 --> 35:04.000
A lot of guys in maintenance
have their own beat.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.042
We get assigned
to whatever needs doing.

35:06.125 --> 35:09.292
Yeah, we keep the place running
while the big boys are fighting

35:09.375 --> 35:12.000
or making all the big decisions.

35:12.083 --> 35:14.958
- Worker caste.
- Yeah.

35:15.042 --> 35:16.667
I guess you could say that.

35:16.750 --> 35:17.958
We're just about as worker caste

35:18.042 --> 35:19.667
as you're ever
gonna find up here.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.167
Now, if you don't mind, ma'am,
the launch bays are this way.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.500
I was, uh, I was going
to ask you a question.

35:25.583 --> 35:26.833
Ma'am?

35:28.458 --> 35:30.625
If I'm launched in a life pod

35:30.708 --> 35:33.375
and let us say,
shortly after the launch

35:33.458 --> 35:37.542
the equipment is accidentally
smashed from the inside

35:37.625 --> 35:39.542
what would happen to the pod?

35:39.625 --> 35:41.958
It'd crash into Epsilon 3.

35:42.042 --> 35:44.417
Or explode. It could explode.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.708
Possible. Wouldn't be good
either way, ma'am.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.583
I see.

35:49.667 --> 35:52.208
Understand,
that while I'm not a prophet

35:52.292 --> 35:55.917
I can tell you that
if I were going to be sent away

35:56.000 --> 35:59.375
in a life pod and forced
to watch everything I love

35:59.458 --> 36:01.625
and have fought
for die before my eyes

36:01.708 --> 36:04.458
without even a chance
to keep it together

36:04.542 --> 36:08.375
the life pod would suffer
just such a terrible accident.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.417
Now time being circular

36:15.500 --> 36:18.208
if we know that this will happen

36:18.292 --> 36:22.083
then we may as well assume
that it has happened already

36:22.167 --> 36:25.708
and that the life pod
is not safe for me to enter.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.083
(Bo)
'The president is right, ma'am.'

36:27.167 --> 36:30.083
It's not safe here
for either one of you.

36:30.167 --> 36:33.750
I know,
but it's home for both of us.

36:43.583 --> 36:44.708
(Bo)
'Ma'am.'

36:46.000 --> 36:48.292
You two really do love
each other, don't you?

36:56.833 --> 36:59.583
[sighs]
Hey, did you see that smile?

36:59.667 --> 37:03.292
I mean, it was like the sun
coming out from behind a cloud.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.708
I did indeed.

37:04.792 --> 37:05.958
Suddenly, I think I understand

37:06.042 --> 37:07.625
Sheridan a lot better.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.042
How so?

37:09.125 --> 37:11.958
Well, dead or alive,
I'd claw my way out of hell

37:12.042 --> 37:14.125
and straight through
10 miles of solid rock

37:14.208 --> 37:15.458
to see that smile again.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.958
Yeah. Whoa! What the hell
was that? A hit?

37:18.042 --> 37:20.375
No, it didn't sound like one.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.458
Oh, yeah. Alright.

37:28.542 --> 37:29.792
What? What is it?

37:29.875 --> 37:32.125
The cavalry's here! Yeah!

37:40.583 --> 37:43.250
[gunfire]

38:07.833 --> 38:09.875
Is that amazing or what?

38:09.958 --> 38:13.333
I mean, they look like angels
swooping in out of the sky.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.208
I thought you said they looked
like plugged chickens.

38:15.292 --> 38:18.167
Yeah, not right now,
they don't.

38:18.250 --> 38:20.208
Hey, do you ever wish
you could be out there?

38:20.292 --> 38:22.958
You know, riding fire
with the rest of them?

38:23.042 --> 38:24.417
Sometimes, yeah.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.750
And sometimes no
and sometimes I wonder

38:40.833 --> 38:42.792
what the hell I'm doing here.

38:42.875 --> 38:45.542
All of this is bigger than you.
It's bigger than me.

38:45.625 --> 38:48.667
It's bigger than anyone
should ever have to deal with.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.167
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean.

38:50.250 --> 38:52.167
Then I take a look
at the rest of them.

38:52.250 --> 38:55.625
Londo, G'Kar, Sheridan, Delenn

38:55.708 --> 38:58.292
and I think
if they can handle it

38:58.375 --> 39:00.458
then I can handle it.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.000
My mother used to tell me..

39:05.083 --> 39:07.417
...God knows the age
of every tree

39:07.500 --> 39:09.333
and the color of every flower

39:09.417 --> 39:11.917
and he knows just how
wide your shoulders are

39:12.000 --> 39:14.292
and he'll never give you
anything to carry

39:14.375 --> 39:16.333
that's bigger
than you can handle.

39:17.667 --> 39:20.292
Then maybe that's what
this whole place is about.

39:20.375 --> 39:23.417
Maybe that's what you have to do
to get by in a place like this.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.458
- And what's that?
- Grow bigger shoulders.

39:26.542 --> 39:27.917
[chuckles]

39:30.875 --> 39:34.042
Hey, looks like
the fighting's stopped.

39:35.167 --> 39:36.250
Yeah.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.667
Best get back to work.

39:38.750 --> 39:40.417
I guess so.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.917
[sighs]

39:58.792 --> 39:59.958
What a mess.

40:00.042 --> 40:02.292
I hear you. It's like
this all over the place.

40:02.375 --> 40:06.083
Hull needs work, we got airlocks
shot out all over Brown level

40:06.167 --> 40:08.792
and you don't even wanna know
what the hazmat boys have

40:08.875 --> 40:10.125
waiting for them outside.

40:10.208 --> 40:11.375
All that stuff.

40:11.458 --> 40:14.500
Body parts, ship parts,
fuel cores.

40:14.583 --> 40:16.750
All of it has to be
picked up and taken away

40:16.833 --> 40:19.625
or it'll just float around
until it messes something up.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.750
Yeah, typical.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.292
They call all the shots

40:22.375 --> 40:23.500
they get all the glory

40:23.583 --> 40:25.542
we clean up all the mess.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.875
[dramatic music]

40:48.417 --> 40:50.333
Well..

40:50.417 --> 40:52.625
...maybe not all the mess.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.583
[instrumental music]

41:37.125 --> 41:39.750
(Corwin)
Cleanup detail is still
working on Bays 3 and 7.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.792
They figure they'll have
the work done by 0900 hours.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.167
Negative. We have a transport
due in at 8:00.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.750
- They'll be done by then.
- Yes, captain.

41:47.833 --> 41:50.292
So anything new from
the hyperspace probes?

41:50.375 --> 41:52.750
Nothing. It looks like
we got them all.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.792
Not even one of them
made it out to report back

41:54.875 --> 41:56.792
on our weaknesses or situation.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.458
Good. Mission accomplished.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.083
They'll move on
to the next target.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.417
Let's just hope it doesn't
have anything to do with us

42:02.500 --> 42:04.667
or anybody else in this sector.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.208
Roger that.

42:07.667 --> 42:08.917
Uh, Captain Lochley?

42:10.333 --> 42:11.417
Yes?

42:14.750 --> 42:15.917
Uh..

42:16.000 --> 42:17.208
'Well, captain, uh..'

42:17.292 --> 42:19.208
[clears throat]

42:19.292 --> 42:22.292
I know you're new here
and all, and, uh

42:22.375 --> 42:24.042
I just wanted to say..

42:25.875 --> 42:27.792
...you're okay
in my book, ma'am.

42:31.083 --> 42:33.125
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:43.042 --> 42:46.083
(man on PA system)
'Medlab 4 reports a power loss.
Get a tech team on it.'

43:02.250 --> 43:04.042
Hello, Mack, Bo.

43:11.750 --> 43:13.750
- Bo?
- Yeah?

43:13.833 --> 43:16.083
She remembered my name.

43:16.167 --> 43:17.917
Our names.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.500
- I think I 'm in love.
- She's married.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.208
Yeah, we could work
somethin' out.

43:23.375 --> 43:25.875
- Will you come on?
- Yeah.

43:27.125 --> 43:28.583
- So lunch?
- Sure.

43:28.667 --> 43:30.083
I'll treat.
How about some spoo?

43:30.167 --> 43:32.250
(Mack)
'At 15 credits an ounce?
You're out of your..'
