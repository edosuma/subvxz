you shouldn't say
your wish out loud,

'cause it might
not come true.

the library in his honor.

There's been a bunch
of threats against him,

You're gonna be doing it
from the drumline.

02:50.620 --> 02:53.040
Okay, yeah, one problem.
I don't know how to drum.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.750
Which is why they should've
given this assignment to me!

I was actually
on the drumline in college.

I'm sorry.
Wait a minute. Uh...

Dad, are you suggesting
that you can

03:06.120 --> 03:07.750
go undercover
as a college student?

03:07.750 --> 03:09.670

I could pass for a senior.

up front and center,

to get the big drum solo,

these specialized drum sticks.

telling you this...

special drum sticks
in my backpack,

10:27.920 --> 10:29.380
You really want me
to answer that question?

10:29.380 --> 10:31.710
No.

10:31.710 --> 10:34.420
Just try them out, okay?
They're right there
in my backpack.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.830
Anyone who plays with them
can play like a pro.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.500
Wow!

10:45.460 --> 10:49.120
Oh, well, I mean,
color me embarrassed.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.080
I am so sorry, officer.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.790
Yeah, it's no problem.

10:53.790 --> 10:57.120
Yeah, hey,
but I guess that means

10:57.120 --> 10:59.080
that we're working
the case together.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
Oh, well, if by "working
the case together"

11:01.080 --> 11:02.330
you mean going
our separate ways

11:02.330 --> 11:04.040
and pretending we never met,
then yeah, bingo!

11:04.040 --> 11:05.420
No! No, no, no, no, no!

11:05.420 --> 11:07.500
Please. This is my last shot

11:07.500 --> 11:10.120
to become a full-time
security officer.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.620
I mean, right now, my badge,
it's just a sticker.

11:15.620 --> 11:16.750
It's just a sticker...

11:16.750 --> 11:18.290
Okay. Okay, okay,
you know what,

11:18.290 --> 11:19.620
um, how about you start

11:19.620 --> 11:21.960
by securing the perimeter
of the campus.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.920
I am on it!

11:23.920 --> 11:26.380
Attention all units!
Attention all units!

11:26.380 --> 11:30.170
This is Part-Time
Security Officer Feffer

11:30.170 --> 11:33.040
calling for a complete
campus lockdown!

11:33.040 --> 11:35.540
Okay, first, that is
a bit of an overreaction,

11:35.540 --> 11:40.210
and secondly, that's
not connected to anything.

11:40.210 --> 11:44.040
Oh! No wonder no one
ever answers me back.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.330
I don't know.

11:49.330 --> 11:51.380
I think it's perfect.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.000
I would just probably add

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
a few of those things
that we talked about.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Right. Commas!

11:58.000 --> 12:00.290
I'd say this is
a great essay.

12:00.290 --> 12:03.580
It's real,
it's from the heart,

12:03.580 --> 12:06.460
it's funny,
and it's you.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.120
The Fashion Institute's
gonna love it.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.210
Thank you so much, Ernie.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.290
Honestly, like, I couldn't
have done this without you.

12:13.290 --> 12:16.420
It was my pleasure.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.170
[both scream]

12:18.170 --> 12:19.620
Oh, okay, yeah!

12:19.620 --> 12:21.250
I'm gonna finish
this one at home.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.500
Good idea. Go home.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.920
All right,
I-I'll see you later.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.040
-Okay.
-Bye.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.250
[both scream]

12:26.250 --> 12:28.080
-I'm going now!
-Please do!

12:28.080 --> 12:31.250
-Okay!
-Hey, wait, that's my laptop!

12:31.250 --> 12:32.830
Okay...

12:37.080 --> 12:38.500
All right, everybody,
get in formation.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.120
We're gonna start
with the solos.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.080
Wait, wait, wait,
I can't find my sticks.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.580
Why don't you use mine?

12:43.580 --> 12:46.120
You're taking everything else
from me.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.750
No, I have to use mine!

12:47.750 --> 12:49.580
Um, 'cause that's gross.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.170
I mean, would you use
somebody else's toothbrush?

12:52.170 --> 12:53.790
Are you planning
on putting them in your mouth?

12:53.790 --> 12:55.420
Maybe. You don't know
my routine.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.710
Start us off. Now.

13:01.790 --> 13:04.080
One, two, three, four.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.710
Five, six, seven, eight!

13:05.710 --> 13:07.170
-Cassandra!
-What?

13:07.170 --> 13:09.380
Does this group go
with, like, prime numbers

13:09.380 --> 13:11.670
or something?
If so, no problem.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.120
Two, three, five, seven--

13:13.120 --> 13:15.580
Would you please play?!

13:15.580 --> 13:19.080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
For sure. Gotcha.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.080
Here we go. Solo.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.080
Ahem.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.920
Maybe your drumming
would sound better

13:35.920 --> 13:37.790
if you did put
the sticks in your mouth.

13:37.790 --> 13:40.170
Okay, Elliot, relax.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.000
It was just a warm-up,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.120
just a little bit
of a warm-up.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.460
Let's get into this...

13:45.460 --> 13:47.330
[exhales]

13:47.330 --> 13:49.460
[whispers] Five, six, seven.
One, two, three.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.040
Okay. Ahem! Mm!

14:05.330 --> 14:07.250
Come on, Captain!

14:07.250 --> 14:09.210
She's clearly choking!

14:09.210 --> 14:11.290
Give me back my solo!

14:11.290 --> 14:13.830
You got it, Elliot.
You can go now.

14:13.830 --> 14:15.420
Oh, man.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.460
[playing sarcastic coda]

14:27.170 --> 14:29.000
You too, Cymbals?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.170
Thought we were friends.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.170
Oh, Officer Bailey!
Officer Bailey!

14:44.790 --> 14:46.750
Officer Bailey!

14:46.750 --> 14:49.210
Shh! What? W-What?
What is it?

14:49.210 --> 14:52.330
-I found something!
-Well, clearly it
wasn't antiperspirant,

14:52.330 --> 14:55.960
-'cause you're drenched
in sweat.
-No, I found your-- I found--

14:55.960 --> 15:00.420
-I found your... [huffs]
-Okay, I need you to stop
saying, "I found your,"

15:00.420 --> 15:02.710
-and tell me what you found.
-I found your sticks.

15:02.710 --> 15:05.620
Oh! My sticks!
Okay, thank you.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.420
Wait, were did
you find these?

15:07.420 --> 15:09.250
In that drummer guy
Elliot's locker.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.330
You know, he seemed
suspicious to me,

15:11.330 --> 15:13.080
so I invaded his privacy,

15:13.080 --> 15:15.500
which I assumed was my right

15:15.500 --> 15:18.420
when you deputized me.

15:18.420 --> 15:21.420
Of course, no, no, no.
Elliot is the threat.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.580
That's why he wanted
the solo so bad.

15:23.580 --> 15:27.040
He's trying
to get close to Parker
at the dedication ceremony.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.380
So, what do I do next?

15:31.380 --> 15:33.380
Okay, listen carefully,
all right?

15:33.380 --> 15:35.380
Hold on.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.710
Okay. I'm listening.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.250
I want you to go...

15:42.250 --> 15:44.080
Go.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.920
...home.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.250
Hom-- Wait a minute!

15:48.250 --> 15:50.250
It seems like you're
trying to get rid of me.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.380
I want to help!
I'm the one who found
the drum sticks.

15:54.380 --> 15:58.880
Okay. Okay. I guess
another set of eyes
couldn't hurt.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.000
You get full clearance.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.880
Yes! Full clearance. Oh!

16:04.880 --> 16:08.080
I haven't been fully cleared
since the arson investigation.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.420
Listen here, Barney,
don't make me rethink this.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.250
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What do you want now?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.710
I want my drum solo back.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.170
Too late.

16:28.170 --> 16:31.540
Yeah, well, I hereby invoke
section five, subsection A--

16:31.540 --> 16:34.330
According to
the amendment bylaws
enacted in 1997,

16:34.330 --> 16:36.120
a formal petition
must be presented

16:36.120 --> 16:38.080
in advance, for
a second drum-off.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.750
Per the 2004 addendum
to that amendment,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.330
it clearly states that if there
are extenuating circumstances--

16:44.330 --> 16:46.120
You don't know
what you're talking about!

16:46.120 --> 16:49.080
Okay, enough! Enough!

16:49.080 --> 16:50.250
Two weeks!

16:50.250 --> 16:52.250
I have two weeks
of school left,

16:52.250 --> 16:53.790
and you're ruining it!

16:56.620 --> 16:58.380
So you'll both
just do the solo!

16:58.380 --> 17:00.290
You'll both stand
on either side of Parker.

17:00.290 --> 17:02.170
-Got it?
-Nuh, I got it.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.750
Is that cool with you, Elliot?
Does it ruin your little plan?

17:04.750 --> 17:08.080
My only plan is
to drum my butt off
at Parker's dedication ceremony.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.880
Don't get in my way.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.290
I will be in your way...

17:13.290 --> 17:15.710
except for the parts
where I choreographed

17:15.710 --> 17:17.540
to be out of your way.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.380
Then I won't be.

17:20.620 --> 17:23.580
Or will I?

17:26.460 --> 17:28.420
[cell phone rings]

17:28.420 --> 17:30.420
Um, hey Bryan.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.000
Hey, KC!

17:32.000 --> 17:34.250
I'm at this thing
my dad dragged me to,

17:34.250 --> 17:36.790
but I'll be free in time
for our movie.

17:36.790 --> 17:41.170
-What movie?
-The movie we said
we were going to tonight.

17:41.170 --> 17:44.080
The movie I already
bought tickets for!

17:46.830 --> 17:49.000
Uh, right.
Right, right, right.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.580
Yeah, of course, that movie.

17:50.580 --> 17:53.210
Um, about that.
I can't go.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.580
You're blowing me off?

17:54.580 --> 17:57.040
No, no.
I'm not blowing you off.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.750
I'm just canceling
at the last minute.

17:59.750 --> 18:03.420
Okay, that is
the very definition
of blowing someone off.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.580
No, see, listen,
you didn't let me finish, okay?

18:06.580 --> 18:11.880
I can't go tonight
because my grandma is not well.

18:11.880 --> 18:18.380
Yeah, have you ever heard
of acute necrotizing
ulcerative gingivitis?

18:18.380 --> 18:20.540
Oh. No, I haven't.

18:20.540 --> 18:23.000
Then that's what she has.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.620
I-I am so sorry.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.540
Go take care
of your grandma.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.330
-Thank you.
-I hope she feels better.

18:29.330 --> 18:30.330
Thank you.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.080
[no audible dialogue]

18:38.210 --> 18:39.620
[door opens]

18:40.620 --> 18:41.920
Heyyy!

18:41.920 --> 18:43.420
How's it going?

18:43.420 --> 18:46.080
Uh, did you get
your application in?

18:46.080 --> 18:47.500
I did! I did!
Thank you!

18:47.500 --> 18:49.330
Thank you so much
for your help.

18:49.330 --> 18:50.620
It was my pleasure.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.120
So we're not gonna talk
about what happened!

18:52.120 --> 18:53.670
-Works for me.
-Oh, me too!

18:53.670 --> 18:55.670
-See you later.
-Ah, see you.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.790
[both scream]

18:57.790 --> 19:01.960
Okay, we clearly need
to talk about
what's happening.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.460
Um, what is going on?

19:04.460 --> 19:06.500
I mean, I barely like you,

19:06.500 --> 19:08.960
and I certainly don't
"like you, like you."

19:08.960 --> 19:12.420
And I feel the same way
about you-- times ten!

19:13.620 --> 19:15.120
So what is going
on here?

19:15.120 --> 19:17.790
I don't know. I don't know.

19:17.790 --> 19:22.540
Um, maybe it's because
you're really passionate

19:22.540 --> 19:24.330
about going to this school,

19:24.330 --> 19:27.330
and somehow that passion

19:27.330 --> 19:30.380
spilled over
into your appreciation?

19:30.380 --> 19:33.330
Yes! Yes! My passion

19:33.330 --> 19:35.540
spilled over
into my appreciation,

19:35.540 --> 19:37.330
and onto your lips!

19:37.330 --> 19:38.750
That makes perfect sense.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.170
-It was nothing!
-Less than nothing.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.290
I'm so glad we
cleared that up!

19:41.290 --> 19:42.330
Me too!

19:50.920 --> 19:53.500
[cheering]

19:53.500 --> 19:55.960
Congratulations
to our benefactor

19:55.960 --> 19:58.210
and to the man
we're celebrating here today,

19:58.210 --> 20:02.210
Mr., uh, Henry Parker!

20:02.210 --> 20:04.460
[cheering]

20:04.460 --> 20:06.380
And now, in a special salute,

20:06.380 --> 20:09.710
the American University
Drumline!

21:07.830 --> 21:11.080
I know you stole my sticks
and put them in your locker.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.620
What? What, locker,
what are you, in high school?

21:14.620 --> 21:15.580
I don't have a locker.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.960
Oh. Yeah, right,
that makes sense.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.380
Wait, if it
wasn't you, then--

21:25.670 --> 21:27.750
Barney Feffer.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.670
Congratulations!
I'm giving you your solo back!

21:30.670 --> 21:32.540
It was never yours to give!

21:33.920 --> 21:35.620
Drumline sounds amazing.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.580
Just wish we could
see it better.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.330
Ooh!

21:41.330 --> 21:44.080
So, you played stupid
and I fell for it.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.080
Played stupid, or am stupid?

21:47.080 --> 21:49.920
Either way, you fell for it.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.790
Well, what's your beef
with Parker?

21:51.790 --> 21:55.960
It all started 35 years ago
at this very university.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.580
Parker and I were assigned
the same dorm room.

21:59.580 --> 22:02.380
I distinctly called dibs
on the top bunk, but Parker!

22:02.380 --> 22:04.290
Okay. Okay.
I've lost interest.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.830
Okay, I'm taking you in.
Let's go.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.580
Yeow!

22:22.790 --> 22:24.710
Nice drum roll, Barney.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.710
Oh, come on.

22:47.330 --> 22:48.880
Well, look at that, Barney.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.540
You just got upgraded
to maximum security.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.460
Wow, Dad,
that was amazing.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.080
I'm so glad that we came.

23:01.750 --> 23:05.790
KC? What are you doing here?

23:08.460 --> 23:09.710
Rob, your name's on TV!
