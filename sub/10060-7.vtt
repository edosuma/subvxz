WEBVTT

00:17.166 --> 00:18.708
I never dreamed that you
could be this cruel.

00:18.708 --> 00:20.708
I don't want to go get a scone
with you this morning and

00:20.708 --> 00:21.750
now I'm cruel!

00:21.959 --> 00:23.583
If this is the type
of thing where

00:23.583 --> 00:25.417
I don't meet your friends,

00:25.417 --> 00:28.041
-I could be Ok wiht that.
-You shouldn't be.

00:28.041 --> 00:30.750
I am not eligible for
anything, actually.

00:30.750 --> 00:31.750
I'll pay for your schooling.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.500
HANNAH: My inner queen,
it makes terrible decisions.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.792
Ah sweetie, well, I am going
to stay with your father.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.250
I think you guys really did
fuck me up.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.000
MARNIE: I just don't know
who I am right now.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.959
I'm like a ghost of myself.

00:45.959 --> 00:49.583
I don't know what I'm doing
here, or anywhere else.

00:50.125 --> 00:52.291
But, I don't want to be
married to you.

00:53.083 --> 00:54.750
♪ (THEME MUSIC) ♪

01:01.959 --> 01:05.041
Your relationship
to the students is not
the problem here, Hannah.

01:05.041 --> 01:07.125
Okay, good,
'cause I'm basically
the teacher of my dreams,

01:07.125 --> 01:10.375
like if Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle
had a baby with that guy
from "Reading Rainbow."

01:10.375 --> 01:12.083
Yeah, it's
the other teachers

01:12.083 --> 01:13.667
who are complaining
about you now.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.959
What?
What teachers?
What complaints?

01:16.959 --> 01:21.917
Apparently, they've heard
that you regularly disparage
them to your shared students.

01:21.917 --> 01:23.458
That is ridiculous.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.250
I don't know them well enough
to disparage them.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.166
They're so cliquey,
they don't invite me anywhere.

01:27.166 --> 01:32.000
Quote, "Señora Gomez
is definitely doing it
with Madame Schwartz,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.625
and I would know
because I'm doing it
with Fran."

01:35.625 --> 01:38.333
You describe
Mr. Kildahl as having,

01:38.333 --> 01:41.166
quote,
"phantom centaur butt,"

01:41.166 --> 01:44.208
which, I'm guessing
is your idea of
a humorous remark.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.875
I mean, it's jokey,
but what it really is

01:45.875 --> 01:47.834
is when a guy has an ass
that, like, really sticks out

01:47.834 --> 01:50.834
to the point where
it seems like a whole horse
has been cut off him.

01:50.834 --> 01:54.291
Quote, "I hate
Mrs. Doerfler.
I just do."

01:54.291 --> 01:55.750
Okay, you have
to give me that one.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.959
She is not nice.
It's like "Matilda" in there.

01:57.959 --> 02:00.166
Hannah, we have been
down this road before.

02:00.166 --> 02:03.834
Now, this is a situation
where I'm gonna have
to take serious action.

02:03.834 --> 02:06.041
I mean, I've been lenient
with you in the past

02:06.041 --> 02:08.834
and that's because
you're liked,

02:08.834 --> 02:10.166
you're a favorite here.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.542
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But, I mean, come on.

02:12.542 --> 02:17.083
What can I do?
You've put me in a very
difficult position.

02:18.208 --> 02:20.417
You're right.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.875
I have.

02:22.875 --> 02:24.083
( stammers )

02:24.083 --> 02:26.166
I have and I'm sorry.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.834
Can you think
of a solution?

02:31.834 --> 02:35.041
( music playing )

02:36.708 --> 02:39.542
Honestly,
men are so afraid
of the female vagina,

02:39.542 --> 02:43.291
we should be, like,
galvanizing and using this
tactic to literally win wars.

02:43.291 --> 02:46.458
I also think it helped
that my bush is at full
capacity right now,

02:46.458 --> 02:48.125
which I'm sorry about.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.250
Are you fucking
kidding me, Hannah?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.750
What is wrong with you?

02:51.750 --> 02:53.291
Do not
play dumb with me.

02:53.291 --> 02:55.291
I don't even know where
to fucking begin with you.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.917
Okay, it seems
I woke the beast again.

02:57.917 --> 02:59.375
This is not a joke.

02:59.375 --> 03:03.041
Showing your vagina
to your boss is not
an okay thing to do.

03:03.041 --> 03:04.500
It wasn't sexual, Fran.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.208
It was so I would
get out of trouble.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.625
To get out of trouble.

03:07.625 --> 03:10.333
We are not five, Hannah.
Jesus Christ.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.166
Listen, okay,
it worked.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.083
Do you really
not get it?

03:15.083 --> 03:16.375
Are you that broken?

03:16.375 --> 03:18.375
Like, how damaged
is your thought process?

03:18.375 --> 03:21.542
As an adult,
you should know taking
your genitals out and--

03:21.542 --> 03:23.542
Stop, okay?
Literally stop.

03:23.542 --> 03:24.750
I didn't do
anything that bad.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.417
I'm not like Bill Cosby
or something.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.083
Okay, you just
interrupted me.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.750
Please do not
interrupt me when
I am speaking to you.

03:30.750 --> 03:34.792
I have asked you
not to roll your
eyes at me a lot.

03:34.792 --> 03:36.041
I was not rolling
my eyes at you.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.583
I was looking up
at a cloud formation

03:37.583 --> 03:39.750
that looked a lot
like Blake Lively.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.417
It's gone.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.458
At the very least,
I would hope that
you would know

03:44.458 --> 03:47.583
I would never want you
to show your vagina
to anyone but me.

03:49.375 --> 03:53.625
Oh, so now I'm not supposed
to show my vagina to anyone
but you, Fran?

03:53.625 --> 03:55.458
It's about to be summer!

04:03.166 --> 04:05.917
Aren't you supposed
to be preparing right now?

04:05.917 --> 04:09.959
Getting into character
and putting on your--
that codpiece?

04:09.959 --> 04:13.708
( laughs )
No, I'm good.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.834
Okay.

04:14.834 --> 04:16.666
So you're--
you're ready.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.333
I'm ready.
I'm ready.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.000
Okay.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.041
Are you ready
for everything?

04:22.041 --> 04:23.083
Yeah.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.333
Wait, what
do you mean?

04:25.333 --> 04:29.542
Like-- you know,
like Hannah and everybody.

04:29.542 --> 04:31.500
Isn't everybody
coming tonight?

04:31.500 --> 04:34.625
You and me
in front of them,

04:34.625 --> 04:36.667
in front of Hannah?
Jesus.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.500
Well, I guess I'm just--
haven't thought about it.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.667
I'm just gonna be acting
most of the time.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.083
Well, that's
good for you.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.166
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm not even talking
to her anyway.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.625
We had a massive row.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.417
- So why are we
talking about it now?
- ( chuckles )

04:50.417 --> 04:53.000
( vocalizes )
Okay.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.208
( moaning )

04:58.834 --> 05:00.583
( laughs )

05:00.583 --> 05:01.875
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.417
- Wish me luck.
- 'Kay.

05:03.417 --> 05:07.458
( singsongy )
Make sure to watch
from the fire escape!

05:07.458 --> 05:09.583
Best view.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.166
What are you doing?

05:11.166 --> 05:13.208
We have plans
this evening
to see a play.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.208
We are now
at that play.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.375
I don't want to have
this discussion right now.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.625
Well, I do.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.250
Oh, oh.

05:20.250 --> 05:23.500
Hannah wants to do
something rude, disruptive,
and inappropriate.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.041
What a twist.

05:29.708 --> 05:32.500
Welcome to "38 Neighbors,"
a theatrical retelling

05:32.500 --> 05:34.250
of the Kitty Genovese
tragedy.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.625
In 1964, Kitty Genovese
was murdered outside her home

05:37.625 --> 05:39.000
in the middle of the night.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.083
Dozens of neighbors
heard her cries for help

05:41.083 --> 05:42.250
and did nothing.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.542
And you are about
to become one of them.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.583
The staircases behind me
lead to the apartments

05:46.583 --> 05:49.583
in which the play
will be taking place.
Explore at your choosing.

05:49.583 --> 05:53.834
By entering this building,
you have all become
silent bystanders.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.792
Go, witness.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.667
Fran, I really do
not feel like I can
be a good witness

05:59.667 --> 06:02.166
until we finish
this conversation.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.083
Hannah, I'm not sure
how I can be clearer
with you.

06:05.083 --> 06:08.917
I do not make scenes
in public.

06:08.917 --> 06:10.750
Great, then we'll keep
this really brief.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.625
I don't think this
is working for me
anymore.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.208
Oh, my God, so now
you're gonna threaten me
to get what you want?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.458
Really flexing
the maturity muscles today.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.917
Nice.

06:18.917 --> 06:21.792
I'm not kidding, Fran.
My anxiety's really spiking.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.667
Come with me.
We're not going that way.

06:24.667 --> 06:27.291
- He's not coming
with us?
- No.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.333
Announcer:
Please pick the apartment
to witness from.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.458
The play
is about to begin.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.750
( music playing )

06:53.458 --> 06:55.125
Hannah:
So, I guess this
is really more of a play

06:55.125 --> 06:56.792
about the neighbors
who ignored Kitty

06:56.792 --> 06:59.250
and not so much
about Kitty herself.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.834
'Cause I was doing
some Wikipedia-ing last night

07:01.834 --> 07:05.333
and I had completely
forgotten the fact
that Kitty was a lesbian.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.667
Do you think that
may have been a factor
in what happened to her?

07:07.667 --> 07:10.959
Wouldn't surprise me.
Another woman deemed
"unacceptable" by society

07:10.959 --> 07:13.250
and left to die
for her sins.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.959
( whispers )
Will you stop
talking, please?

07:14.959 --> 07:16.500
The play
has barely started.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.166
That's not
how plays work.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.083
Okay, Ray, great.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.166
Silence me,
just like all of them.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.750
How are we
supposed to learn--

07:24.750 --> 07:27.625
Stop ignoring me, Ellen.
I know you took it
without asking.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.625
Oh, shush up, Joan.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.083
I'd never wear
your stupid mini.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.417
I'm telling Mom
you wear blusher
to school.

07:33.417 --> 07:36.208

Literally all I've seen
since I got here

08:17.208 --> 08:19.208
is some beatnik
rolling cigarettes.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.375

08:21.375 --> 08:22.875
Respect the craft.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.583

will you go out in
the hallway with me

08:24.583 --> 08:27.250

you're actually
an amazing dancer.

08:46.375 --> 08:49.166
What's up?
What's on your mind?

08:49.166 --> 08:51.583
Can you, um...

08:51.583 --> 08:53.542
Are we praying?

08:54.583 --> 08:56.458
I left Desi.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.208
Wow.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.959
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.917
Is this for real?

09:03.917 --> 09:07.458
Yes, Ray, this is
the realest thing
I've ever done.

09:07.458 --> 09:08.625
Huh.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.792
And I wanted
you to know.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.041
How did it
finally happen?

09:13.041 --> 09:15.667
It wasn't like
a big fight or anything.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.125
It was a lot
of little shitty moments

09:18.125 --> 09:21.166
kind of strung together,
you know?

09:21.166 --> 09:23.208
Look, if I'm being
completely honest
with myself,

09:23.208 --> 09:25.208
I think I probably knew
we were going to get divorced

09:25.208 --> 09:26.667
before we even
got married.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.333
I just was really scared

09:28.333 --> 09:30.834
of what it was that
I knew that I needed.

09:32.125 --> 09:35.959
I think that what
I need is to be...

09:37.875 --> 09:39.708
alone.

09:39.708 --> 09:41.583
To be alone, yeah.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.834
I mean, right.
That makes sense.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.166
So that is
where I am.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.625
And I wanted to know
what you think.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.750
What do I think?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.583
I think that, um...

09:52.583 --> 09:54.083
I'm sorry you're
going through all this.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.375
- Thank you.
- That's what I think.

09:55.375 --> 09:56.750
I think
I'm handling it
pretty well.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, I think
it's also important

09:58.000 --> 09:59.708
to go back in there
and witness.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.625
Otherwise we repeat
our mistakes.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.000
( music playing )

10:10.000 --> 10:13.375
♪ And melt like
solid gold... ♪

10:14.208 --> 10:15.917
Seriously,
you have no idea.

10:15.917 --> 10:19.041
It's less of a boat
and more of a floating
palace, really.

10:19.041 --> 10:20.166
Out of this world.

10:20.166 --> 10:23.041
( laughs )
I really like your top.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.917
I have a friend who has
one sort of like that,

10:24.917 --> 10:26.667
but it doesn't do
the same thing for her.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.792
- Oh, thanks.
- Boys, I'm so sorry.

10:28.792 --> 10:31.917
I have to deal with
a Chinese fur catastrophe,
of all things.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.333
See you later.
Catch up later.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.000
Great party, Dill.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.750
Head-to-toe mesh
and Chinese fur.
What?

10:39.750 --> 10:41.708
What do you think
about all this?
You having fun?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.708
- Yeah, of course
I'm having fun.
- Good.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.750
I did poppers
with the guy who
invented Boy Butter.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.583
And then this lady
in a corset

10:47.583 --> 10:52.125
asked me if I was
one of Ralph Lauren's
adopted male model sons.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.041
Ralph doesn't have
any adopted sons.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.208
I know, that's why
I'm sticking to my story

10:55.208 --> 10:57.083
- that I'm one of them.
- ( laughs )

10:57.083 --> 10:59.041
- Good on you.
- Right?

10:59.041 --> 11:00.542
Yeah, I'm just
checking in.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.041
It's important
to check in.

11:02.041 --> 11:04.458
That's something
I care about.

11:04.458 --> 11:08.208
Have I told you
how happy I am that
you're here tonight?

11:08.208 --> 11:10.792
Well, I'm happy
to be here.

11:10.792 --> 11:12.041
I feel oddly at home.

11:12.041 --> 11:15.250
Your friends
are all very nice.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.667
Mine are mean and poor.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.834
Yeah, they're
good people.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.458
It's easy to lose sight
of what's important,

11:21.458 --> 11:23.875
and good people
are what's important.

11:23.875 --> 11:28.458
In my line of work,
you get stuck between
these two polarities,

11:28.458 --> 11:31.750
with orphans in Haiti
and rich meals,

11:31.750 --> 11:34.375
tsunami-wrecked shores
and fine suits.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.041
You get
emotional whiplash.

11:36.041 --> 11:38.875
It's hard to tell
what's real and what's not.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.125
But in the end
of the day,

11:41.125 --> 11:45.625
it's who's left
standing beside you
that matters most.

11:45.625 --> 11:49.291
I'm so happy
that you're standing
beside me.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.667
Wow, you're
like a poet.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.458
I guess I'm inspired.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.333
How you'd like
to meet Zac Posen?

12:04.333 --> 12:05.917
I would love
to meet Zac Posen.

12:05.917 --> 12:07.125
- Okay.
- ( chuckles )

12:07.125 --> 12:08.792
Adam:
No, no, no.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.375
I don't owe you
a goddamn thing, Ruthie.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.458
Ruthie:
You owe me the last
20 years, ya queer.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.083
You want me to prove
to you I'm not queer?

12:14.083 --> 12:16.125
You want me to do
more for you than
I already do?

12:16.125 --> 12:17.458
- ( woman screaming )
- Oh, please.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.959
What do you fucking
do for me anyway?

12:18.959 --> 12:20.792
Dirty the dishes
and leave your
underwears around?

12:20.792 --> 12:22.583
- What's that?
- What?

12:22.583 --> 12:24.625
Adam:
It sounded like
a lady out there.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.041
So what?

12:26.041 --> 12:28.208
Since when are you
interested in girls,
anyway?

12:28.208 --> 12:31.166
Something strange
going on out there,
I think.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.083
If you want
one of his cigarettes,
just take it.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.834
People were totally
eating out of the candy
bowl next door.

12:35.834 --> 12:39.166
Oh, God. Ay dios mio,
I should've married
your sister.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.250
No, you should've
married my brother.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.000
I don't want to hear
about this anymore.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.375
Dad, I think there's
a lady in the courtyard.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.917
It can't be anything good
this time of night.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.542
Did you finish
your homework?

12:48.542 --> 12:50.834
No, I was watching
a program and forgot.
Why do I--?

12:50.834 --> 12:52.750
Adam: ...you guys
aren't hanging out together
at the grocery store

12:52.750 --> 12:54.333
and sucking
each other's tits?

12:54.333 --> 12:55.667
- Ruthie: Fuck you.
- Adam: Fuck you!

- Yeah.

14:24.625 --> 14:26.583
You're the host.
People need you.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.291
Thank you, dear.

14:28.291 --> 14:32.125
Okay, now's the time
in the evening where
I explain ISIS to you.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.625
So just-- we're just gonna
take it down a notch and--

14:34.625 --> 14:38.166
please, you're
just in time.

14:42.291 --> 14:44.250
Quite the shindig.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.792
I've already had,
like, 14 of those
tiny plates of tartar

14:47.792 --> 14:50.166
with that
little quail egg.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.208
I know, if this
building got bombed,
Sarah Jessica Parker

14:52.208 --> 14:54.625
would have to speak
at, like, a hundred
funerals.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.083
( both laugh )

14:56.083 --> 14:59.417
Were you here last month
for the morning rave?

14:59.417 --> 15:01.959
Uh, no.
No, I was not.

15:01.959 --> 15:04.458
What brings you
here tonight?

15:04.458 --> 15:08.250
Well, uh,
our fair host,
actually.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.625
Oh, nice.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.458
Dill's a doll,
isn't he?

15:11.458 --> 15:13.041
Yeah, yeah.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.583
It's always hard to know
when somebody's so,

15:15.583 --> 15:17.166
you know, famous,
quote, unquote,

15:17.166 --> 15:19.959
but I gotta say,
he really knows
how to make a guy

15:19.959 --> 15:21.500
feel like the only girl
in the room, you know?

15:21.500 --> 15:23.959
Mm.

15:23.959 --> 15:27.792
He called me from Baghdad
the other week

15:27.792 --> 15:29.000
from a satellite phone

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
just to see how
my teeth cleaning went.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.667
I mean, so sweet.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.750
Tell me about it.
You know, he took
my friend Muzzy

15:35.750 --> 15:37.583
to this black-tie
gala last week

15:37.583 --> 15:40.834
and, you know,
Muzzy doesn't even
own a tuxedo.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.125
Dill had one
made for him.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.417
Made.
You know, lifesaver.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.583
Really?

15:45.583 --> 15:48.083
Ooh, rosemary mojito,
please, yes.

15:48.083 --> 15:51.750
You know, I feel like
a lot of people here
have stories like that.

15:51.750 --> 15:55.750
You know, like one time
I was complaining about how
stressed out I was at work

15:55.750 --> 15:57.500
because of all these
promotions I was getting,

15:57.500 --> 16:00.083
and I didn't know
that Dill was listening.

16:00.083 --> 16:03.417
And he treated me
to a weekend in the Bahamas.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.500
That was, of course,
before I met my boyfriend.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.542
- Ugh.
- Of course.

16:07.542 --> 16:11.291
- Oh, do you know Shane?
Uh, Metzler-Cobbling?
- No.

16:11.291 --> 16:14.375
Okay, well, he and Dill
only dated for, like,
two weeks,

16:14.375 --> 16:17.750
but Dill still lets
him live in his spare
downstairs apartment.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.542
I mean, it's not even
a creepy deal.

16:19.542 --> 16:22.000
Like, they only have sex
when Shane really wants to,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.959
which I hear is a lot,
but, like, I haven't talked
to Shane in a while--

16:24.959 --> 16:26.708
- Please walk away.
- Okay.

16:28.375 --> 16:31.375
( indistinct chatter )

16:32.875 --> 16:35.250
This neighborhood,
there's always noise
outside.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.041
- You don't think
anything of it.
- Mm-hmm.

16:37.041 --> 16:40.000
We were just living
our boring lives, baby.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.583
( quietly )
This play is
super unrealistic.

16:44.583 --> 16:45.834
I need to
talk to you now.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.917
Can I ask you--
do you think that
I deserve

16:47.917 --> 16:50.125
all of the things
that are happening to me?

16:50.125 --> 16:51.500
Maybe.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.750
- Are Jessa and Adam fucking?
- Oh, come on.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.417
Seriously, Marnie,
if you know anything,
I can take it.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.417
You gotta tell me.
I need you to share--

16:58.417 --> 17:01.166
I'm sorry,
I've been a little too busy
Yelping divorce lawyers

17:01.166 --> 17:04.000
to worry about the sex lives
of our second-tier friends.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.875
( sighs )
I know it.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.083
They're fucking.
They are fully fucking.

17:08.083 --> 17:09.959
- What the fuck is wrong
with people?
- Shh!

17:09.959 --> 17:11.541
Ahem!

17:15.250 --> 17:16.791
( knock on door )

17:16.791 --> 17:18.416
Someone's in here.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.875
There you are.
You disappeared.

17:20.875 --> 17:22.416
And, to add insult
to injury,

17:22.416 --> 17:24.165
with my drink
in your hand.

17:24.165 --> 17:27.708
( chuckles )
Sorry, I guess
I just needed a break.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.458
Well, you come out
when you're ready.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.000
You look
hot as hell tonight.
I wanna show you off.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.834
( chuckles )

17:34.834 --> 17:37.792
Hey, Dill, did you
take someone named Muzzy

17:37.792 --> 17:40.458
to a black-tie gala
last week?

17:41.750 --> 17:44.083
I'm sorry,
but did you?

17:45.291 --> 17:48.583
I took a friend
to a work event
last week, yes.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.625
There are many friends,
there are many work events.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.625
Is there a reason
why you're asking?

17:54.625 --> 17:56.708
No, I just--

17:56.708 --> 17:58.166
no, somebody
just said that.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.834
Mm-hmm.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.875
They also said you keep
a guy named Shane

18:01.875 --> 18:04.625
downstairs
for sometimes sex.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.375
( chuckles )

18:06.375 --> 18:09.625
( chuckles )
Of course they did.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.250
You know, just because
I'm a public figure,

18:14.250 --> 18:17.375
people feel
they have a right
to say what they want,

18:17.375 --> 18:19.875
think what they want.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.000
God damn it,
it's hard sometimes.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.750
I don't have
any power to stop it.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.834
It's good
that you're learning
this now, Elijah.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.875
There's always gonna
be people in your ear.

18:30.875 --> 18:35.041
The key is knowing
when to tune it out.

18:35.041 --> 18:38.667
You know that I would
never disappoint you
on purpose, right?

18:40.333 --> 18:41.667
I know.

18:43.333 --> 18:47.417
So, lighten up,
tough guy.
It's a party.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.375
( laughs )

18:51.375 --> 18:54.917
I just want to be clear
about what our situation is.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.583
What situation?

18:56.583 --> 18:59.708
I'm a busy man
with a lot of
important friends.

18:59.708 --> 19:01.792
Many of them are
out there right now.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.208
Most of them are
enjoying themselves.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.166
There's only one
who isn't,

19:05.166 --> 19:07.041
and he's standing
right in front of me,
keeping me from them.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.959
Well, maybe those people
don't want to say anything

19:08.959 --> 19:11.041
'cause they're too psyched
to be hanging out with
a famous person.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.708
Uh, no, I don't
think that's it.

19:17.041 --> 19:18.875
What?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.875
So now I should leave?

19:23.875 --> 19:25.375
Do you think
you should leave?

19:25.375 --> 19:27.875
I don't know.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.375
I'm glad
we had this talk.
I feel better.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.875
You should, too.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.917
If you don't,
then, yes, I'd go
if I were you.

20:04.917 --> 20:08.708
( growls )
I do not feel better.

20:11.250 --> 20:12.834
You don't know
for sure, though.

20:12.834 --> 20:15.959
Do I not fucking know
those tree-hugging
clit-suckers?

20:15.959 --> 20:17.291
I fucking know.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.917
They were doing it
behind my back,

20:18.917 --> 20:21.625
but right
in front of my face.

20:21.625 --> 20:23.291
What the fuck
are you doing here?

20:23.291 --> 20:24.667
Marnie, I have
to talk to you.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.583
Desi, no means no.
The divorce is happening.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.625
- I told all our friends--
- This is bigger
than our divorce.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.125
This is bigger
than anybody's divorce.

20:30.125 --> 20:33.291
Marnie, we got the call.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.291
What?

20:35.291 --> 20:37.125
Alex Patsavas.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.458
Alex Patsavas.

20:38.458 --> 20:41.041
- Alex Patsavas?
- ( breathing deeply )

20:41.041 --> 20:42.959
- Alex Patsavas?
- Yeah, man.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.875
Who the fuck
is Alex Patsavas?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.708
Hannah, pick up a newspaper.
She does all the music
on "Grey's Anatomy."

20:47.708 --> 20:48.959
Well, let's not
minimize, Marn.

20:48.959 --> 20:50.291
She also
fucking killed it
on "Twilight"...

20:50.291 --> 20:52.250
- "Gossip Girl"...
- ..."Gossip Girl,"

20:52.250 --> 20:54.250
- Both: "OC."
- I mean, she's, like...

20:54.250 --> 20:55.875
- ( exhales )
- What did she want?

20:55.875 --> 20:59.333
- What she wants--
what she wants...
- Uh-huh?

20:59.333 --> 21:01.917
...is to use
"Matter of Waiting"
on "Grey's."

21:01.917 --> 21:04.500
- They say it's for
a huge fucking scene.
- ( squeals )

21:04.500 --> 21:07.083
- Somebody fucking dies, Marn.
- Oh, my God, who dies?

21:07.083 --> 21:09.333
They're not gonna
tell me that, but it's
a principal for sure.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.667
- A principal?
- Yes.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.333
It could even
be a montage.
I don't know.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.000
- But I could
see that, you know?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.291
- I could totally see that.
- This is the real deal.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.000
- I talked to Marcus
from the label.
- Yeah.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.834
He said we have
to ride the wave.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.500
We have to fucking
tour the shit
out of this song.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.333
This is our moment.
We gotta make this work.

21:25.333 --> 21:28.041
Yes, we do, we do.
We have to make this work.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.875
Okay.

21:31.542 --> 21:34.375
You mean just
as a band, right?

21:34.375 --> 21:37.166
Yeah, just the band.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.417
( groans )

21:43.333 --> 21:46.500
♪ Cuckoo clock,
stop looking at me ♪

21:46.500 --> 21:48.333
( vocalizing guitar riff )

21:48.333 --> 21:51.041
♪ Do you see
the world that I see? ♪

21:51.041 --> 21:52.166
( both vocalize
guitar riff )

21:52.166 --> 21:53.917
( pounding on door )

21:53.917 --> 21:55.125
Dill:
Elijah!

21:55.125 --> 21:57.375
( pounding )
Elijah!

21:57.375 --> 21:59.208
( pounding continues )

21:59.208 --> 22:01.166
Stop it.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.250
You left
without saying good-bye.

22:03.250 --> 22:06.166
Well, I didn't have
anything left to say.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.375
( moans )

22:08.375 --> 22:11.000
I'm sorry...

22:11.000 --> 22:13.625
I didn't tell you
how much you mean.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.125
You are wasted.
Come on.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.417
( moans )
Let's go lie down.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.959
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.417
Yeah.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.208
Okay.

22:36.375 --> 22:38.458
Wait, wait.
I don't--

22:38.458 --> 22:40.166
I don't want to be
with you like this.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.625
Like what?

22:41.625 --> 22:43.417
Like Mel Gibson.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.208
Okay.

22:53.166 --> 22:56.417
- ( sighs )
- ( moaning, kissing )

23:07.333 --> 23:09.291
Dill?

23:12.291 --> 23:13.875
Dill?

23:13.875 --> 23:17.291
( snoring softly )

23:19.291 --> 23:22.041
( sighs )

23:22.041 --> 23:25.750
Everyone just assumes
we made all this progress
in the last few decades,

23:25.750 --> 23:28.291
we made all these
monumental strides forward
in our thinking,

23:28.291 --> 23:31.166
but the fact is,
the ugly truth is,
Hannah,

23:31.166 --> 23:35.500
human apathy continues
to be one of the grossest
threats to mankind.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.250
Very dangerous.
Very dangerous.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.750
Right up there
with those "Keep Calm
and Carry On" posters

23:39.750 --> 23:42.291
and anyone who
chooses to have
more than one child.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.333
Very dangerous.

23:44.333 --> 23:47.000
But what if you've been
a silent bystander all along,

23:47.000 --> 23:48.417
but you don't
even know it?

23:48.417 --> 23:50.083
You just--
you've been a witness,

23:50.083 --> 23:52.208
but you've been
a witness to something
you couldn't explain

23:52.208 --> 23:53.750
because you didn't
know anything about it,

23:53.750 --> 23:55.375
so how could you
say anything about it?

23:55.375 --> 23:56.834
- And I--
- Hey.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.500
Why don't you
deal with this one?

23:58.500 --> 24:01.291
I'm gonna do
some follow-up reading.
I'm going deep Internet.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.333
Good-bye.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.792
Okay.

24:06.792 --> 24:12.041
So, ready to put aside
our differences and have
a nice rest of the night?

24:12.041 --> 24:13.458
Hey.

24:13.458 --> 24:16.000
Hello, hello, hi.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.500
Great job, by the way.
I thought the play
was really good.

24:18.500 --> 24:22.000
I thought you really were
subtle with the rape theme.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.291
Thanks.
Thank you.

24:25.291 --> 24:27.375
Hey.

24:27.375 --> 24:29.417
Hey.

24:29.417 --> 24:33.250
I'll, uh-- bye.

24:50.708 --> 24:53.959
Okay, I can see that you're
stonewalling me here.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.542
Is it because
of what you said before,

24:55.542 --> 24:58.875
that this isn't
working out for you?

24:58.875 --> 25:01.375
Because even
if that is true,

25:01.375 --> 25:03.625
I would ask that you
at least acknowledge

25:03.625 --> 25:06.500
that you can
hear me right now.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.834
Hannah?

25:07.834 --> 25:09.500
( breathing deeply )

25:09.500 --> 25:11.917
Hannah.

25:11.917 --> 25:14.375
Hey, I'm--

25:14.375 --> 25:16.625
What the fuck?

25:17.667 --> 25:19.333
I'm sorry.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.208
I'm sorry.
That was--

25:21.208 --> 25:22.875
What the hell
is going on?

25:22.875 --> 25:25.250
I'm really sorry.
( exhales )

25:25.250 --> 25:26.750
Do you want to be
alone for the night?

25:26.750 --> 25:28.917
- Like, that's fine.
- I really don't.

25:28.917 --> 25:30.667
I really do not want
to be alone for the night.

25:30.667 --> 25:33.000
I'm so sorry, Fran.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.375
Please.

25:35.375 --> 25:37.875
I'm so sorry.
