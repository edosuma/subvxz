WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.674
[peppy jingle playing]

00:15.724 --> 00:17.851
[Santi] Your grandmother
was Kimberly, too?

00:17.851 --> 00:20.437
I thought you were gonna
say Kardashian. [laughing]

00:21.104 --> 00:24.107
[Kimberly] You think I could
be part of the family? [laughs]

00:24.107 --> 00:26.276
What you doing tonight? Let's get dinner.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.902
I gotta study tonight.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.030
You can't go out 'cause you gotta study?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.698
- Yes.
- [Santi] For what?

00:31.698 --> 00:32.824
For the bar.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.367
- For the bar?
- [chuckles] Yes.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.787
Oh, you're gonna be a bartender.
That's... That's cute.

00:38.830 --> 00:39.956
[Sebastian clears throat]

00:40.707 --> 00:41.541
<i>Mira a este.</i>

00:41.541 --> 00:42.500
Big cuz!

00:42.500 --> 00:43.960
- What's up?
- Hi, Santi.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.670
No more, uh, Invisaligns.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.131
A smile built by botched BBLs.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.383
[door opens]

00:51.009 --> 00:51.843
[Santi sighs]

00:51.843 --> 00:53.595
Nice conversation with Kimberly.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.431
Oh, my God, I feel like
there was a real vibe there.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.891
- What's her deal?
- Her deal

00:57.891 --> 01:00.560
is that she's my receptionist,
so don't go there.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.978
- No, no.
- Close the door.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.688
Well...

01:03.688 --> 01:05.607
- [door closes]
- Okay.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.112
Santi, if you get the job,
you can't be flirting with coworkers.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.406
It's extremely unprofessional.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.324
If?

01:14.949 --> 01:17.827
I came to you because you're my cousin.
I thought I had the job.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.371
Wish I could,
but I'm not the only partner here.

01:20.371 --> 01:22.373
Nepotism don't hit like it used to.

01:22.373 --> 01:25.001
Nepotism is why you're here
in the first place.

01:25.543 --> 01:26.377
Wow.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.422
Look, it'll be fine.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.799
Okay?

01:30.799 --> 01:32.509
We'll do a follow-up next week.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.177
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.014
I'mma manage the shit
out of this BBL firm.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.809
I even came up with
new slogan ideas. Check it.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.770
"We're the firm when your butt is not."

01:46.689 --> 01:48.024
I'm giving you gold here.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.991
Héctor, 80% of our customer base
has osteoporosis.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.827
Stack the pineapples horizontally,

01:58.827 --> 01:59.911
not vertically.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.206
- [Felix] What's up?
- What the fuck you doing?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.666
I'm using the store Wi-Fi.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.086
The landlady disabled ours
'cause you didn't pay for it.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.003
What?

02:09.003 --> 02:11.506
Okay. Stop. No! No, no, no!

02:11.506 --> 02:13.466
- What the fuck?
- This is my workplace,

02:13.466 --> 02:15.135
where I make money for the Wi-Fi.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.512
Don't want Eduardo
thinking my friends show up

02:17.512 --> 02:20.014
- and eat free food.
- Wait. The Eduardo?

02:20.515 --> 02:22.016
Am I the only one that works?

02:22.016 --> 02:25.687
No. I heard a rumor that the real Eduardo
died, like, 20 years ago

02:25.687 --> 02:28.106
and the new commercials are a CGI-Eduardo.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.691
That's true, saw it on Reddit.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.068
Okay, no. That's insane. [scoffs]

02:33.236 --> 02:35.071
- Okay, stop it. Stop it!
- You stop.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.072
[both scream]

02:36.072 --> 02:37.407
- Sorry!
- [Eduardo] <i>Niño!</i>

02:37.407 --> 02:38.825
- [Ness] Fuck.
- [Felix] Oh, my God.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.076
[Santi] Holy shit.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.786
It's the legend.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.329
- Eduardo!
- Eduardo!

02:43.329 --> 02:45.081
It's me, yes. [laughs]

02:45.081 --> 02:47.375
<i>- Señor</i> Eduardo, I am so sorry.
- That's okay,

02:47.375 --> 02:50.044
I always love to meet fans, you know?

02:50.044 --> 02:52.922
Especially someone
below the retirement age,

02:52.922 --> 02:55.008
you know, walking into my store?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.802
Well, um, Felix and Santi
were just leaving

02:57.802 --> 02:59.804
- to go work on their music video.
- Wait.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.849
This is the Santi? You know?

03:02.849 --> 03:06.144
The one my little granddaughter
can't stop talking about?

03:06.144 --> 03:10.481
My God! We always sing you in my car.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.234
- [Eduardo singing "Exagerao"]
- [Ness laughing]

03:13.234 --> 03:14.485
[Santi] What?

03:14.485 --> 03:15.987
Eduardo knows my song?

03:15.987 --> 03:18.156
<i>Abuela</i> would be losing her shit right now.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.783
It's an honor to have you
in my store, all right?

03:20.783 --> 03:23.286
And you can bring
all the young friend you want.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.246
They can have all the fruit they want.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.665
- Thank you.
- No you, please. Okay?

03:27.665 --> 03:28.583
You.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.126
[Ness laughing]

03:30.126 --> 03:32.295
<i>- ♪ Eduardo! ♪
- ♪ Eduardo! ♪</i>

03:32.295 --> 03:34.464
- <i>♪ Eduardo! ♪</i>
- [Ness laughing]

03:34.464 --> 03:36.466
<i>- ♪ Eduardo! ♪
- ♪ Eduardo! ♪</i>

03:36.466 --> 03:38.676
[Ness] Wait, Eduardo,
I have an idea for you.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.262
[woman laughing]

03:41.262 --> 03:43.139
[Santi] Musicians make the best lovers.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.225
- They did a poll on it.
- Who's they?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.976
- Scientists.
- Guys. Hi.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.479
Guess who got you
directing and acting in a commercial

03:49.479 --> 03:50.939
for freaking Eduardo's? <i>Yo.</i>

03:50.939 --> 03:53.233
[grunting] Yes.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.235
- Grocery store ad? Really, Ness?
- Yeah!

03:55.235 --> 03:56.736
Santi needs to make real art.

03:56.736 --> 04:01.366
Ness, like, I... I just don't think that
a commercial is, like, my next big thing?

04:01.366 --> 04:02.742
No, no, not a commercial.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.703
It is an opportunity
to make a music video for free.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.538
Eduardo wants younger clientele.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.998
I convinced him you'd do that.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.000
We just have to put his granddaughter in.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.753
- Babysitting gig.
- Wait, hold up. Hold up.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.256
What if I take the old Eduardo's jingle,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.549
- because everyone loves it, right?
- Uh-huh.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.093
But I just remix it,

04:20.093 --> 04:21.719
throw a dembow beat behind it...

04:21.719 --> 04:23.763
- Ah.
- ...then it can actually be pretty lit.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.766
An iconic part of South Florida history
with a Santi spin.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.726
- Yes! Yes!
- See? See?

04:29.352 --> 04:30.270
Okay.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.105
- Yo.
- I'm intrigued.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.940
What's the budget?

04:34.857 --> 04:38.278
Uh-uh. No, absolutely not. If I tell you,
you're gonna wanna blow it.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.654
- So, it's, like, big.
- No.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.738
- No.
- It's big?

04:40.738 --> 04:43.116
Think small, okay, because our paycheck

04:43.116 --> 04:45.326
is whatever's left after we finish this,

04:45.326 --> 04:47.287
so if we do it right, we do it cheap...

04:47.287 --> 04:49.789
- [whispers] We can make some serious cash.
- Wait.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.250
Serious cash which we really need.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.420
We're about to make bank
and we're about to make a new video?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.963
- Exactly.
- No-brainer.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.715
- No-brainer.
- Okay.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.259
- This is making sense to me. Let's do it.
- Uh-huh.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.677
- Let's do it.
- Let's go!

05:02.677 --> 05:06.431
I gotta say, I was expecting
some corny Frosted Flakes shit

05:06.431 --> 05:09.309
when you mentioned the remix of a jingle,

05:09.309 --> 05:10.935
but it's undeniably good.

05:11.644 --> 05:15.606
Okay. So, I mean,
we've shown you new stuff. [chuckles]

05:15.606 --> 05:16.607
Um...

05:17.900 --> 05:20.528
- Are you gonna sign Santi?
<i>- Oh, obviously.</i>

05:20.528 --> 05:24.157
As you know, labels are famous
for signing artists from TV commercials.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.035
I heard the 1-800-Kars4Kids guy
has a residency

05:27.035 --> 05:28.953
at Madison Square Garden next month.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.913
Mia, cake!

05:30.913 --> 05:32.749
Uh, Ness, can I call you...

05:32.749 --> 05:35.501
<i>- Just give me a second.</i>
- I need you to pick up a cake.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.253
The good kind for celebrities.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.672
Not the shitty kind
we get for your birthdays.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.883
Absolutely. Who are we sending it out to?

05:42.675 --> 05:46.304
Oh, it's just for us. I'm gonna announce
Jalen's promotion this afternoon.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.097
Jalen?

05:48.097 --> 05:49.390
Tien's new assistant?

05:49.390 --> 05:51.351
He's only been here for six weeks.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.852
All of them have kicked ass.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.563
Have you heard
his cold pussy story? [chuckling]

05:55.563 --> 05:57.065
There's... So there's this...

05:57.065 --> 05:58.608
- [laughing]
- Mmm.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.485
I couldn't possibly do it justice.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.903
- Hear it from him.
- I bet.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.196
You on a personal call?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.073
Uh, no. Um...

06:06.074 --> 06:08.117
Your accountant. He had some questions--

06:08.117 --> 06:09.452
[scatting] Don't tell me.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.080
- Plausible deniability.
- That's right. [laughs]

06:14.791 --> 06:15.917
- [grunts]
- [both laughing]

06:15.917 --> 06:17.668
- Can I call you later?
- [phone clicks]

06:17.668 --> 06:18.586
Oh.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.255
[softly] Okay. [sighs]

06:29.639 --> 06:30.473
[sighs]

06:30.473 --> 06:33.976
This is great. You made
the world's first jingle I'd fuck to.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.436
[Santi laughs]

06:35.436 --> 06:37.188
- Yes!
- Second.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.440
Third or fourth, I don't know.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.733
Might be a thing for me.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.194
Let's hope normal people
find it fuck worthy.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.072
I think Paola thought
it was a little fuck worthy, huh?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.574
- [Santi] Chill, yo.
- Paola? From work?

06:48.574 --> 06:50.535
<i>Nena,</i> I'm an artist,

06:50.535 --> 06:54.455
and my heart is overflowing with passion.
You got to let the volcano erupt.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.498
Doesn't have to erupt

06:55.498 --> 06:57.083
- all over my co-worker!
- Ow!

06:57.667 --> 06:58.751
That's gross!

06:59.335 --> 07:03.256
That was gross? Okay. On this set,
I need you to act professional.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.299
Mommy, Daddy, stop fighting.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.009
We need to talk pre-pro.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.762
Looked at camera rentals.
This is what I was thinking.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.141
Jesus Christ.
That's more than we spend on rent.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.559
Find something cheaper.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.019
But why? This is the camera
used on <i>Moonlight.</i>

07:17.019 --> 07:20.982
We should do what they did.
You know better than James Laxton,

07:20.982 --> 07:23.109
- the cinematographer of <i>Moonlight?</i>
- [phone dings]

07:23.109 --> 07:24.485
The woman from the Jowell show

07:24.485 --> 07:26.279
- just wrote about us.
- Oh, awesome.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.366
Or boo.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.453
"When you meet the team behind "Exagerao,"

07:33.453 --> 07:35.830
it starts to feel like
even more of a miracle."

07:35.830 --> 07:38.458
"Lord only knows
how Santi Quiñones and his childlike,

07:38.458 --> 07:40.751
childhood friends
released something so mature."

07:40.877 --> 07:42.211
- [Felix] What?
-"When I met Santi,

07:42.211 --> 07:44.547
he was rushing the stage
grabbing for attention."

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
"His creative director, in a sweatshirt,

07:46.507 --> 07:48.426
wore his inexperience on his sleeve."

07:48.426 --> 07:51.721
"And his manager
had already stalked me to an event

07:51.721 --> 07:54.056
scheming in a way
to make Scooby-Doo jealous."

07:54.056 --> 07:55.975
Okay, why would Scooby be jealous?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.394
He doesn't make the schemes.
Fred and Velma do.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.480
Dumbass, calls herself a journalist.

08:02.523 --> 08:06.235
Okay, no. We're not getting in our
feelings about one snarky little write-up.

08:06.235 --> 08:08.613
This is why
men shouldn't be allowed to read.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.656
No, you're right.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.493
It's nothing. I mean,
what does she know, right?

08:18.456 --> 08:20.458
[men speaking indistinctly]

08:21.834 --> 08:23.920
What's up, my guy? Mr. Lights.
Mr. Light Man.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.505
- Hey, I'm Jose.
- That's great.

08:25.505 --> 08:29.342
What's up with these? They look expensive.
Uh, was that part of the budget?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.594
[Jose] Felix told me
to set these lights up.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.888
- Felix.
- [Felix] Yeah, one sec.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.389
Ray, the fruit needs to pop.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.100
I'd say like 60, 65% more pop, please.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.311
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, just pop.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.605
- Talk to set deck.
- We don't have a set deck.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.232
Ness, you penny-pinching fuck.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.193
- Just light it better.
- Is this your first time directing?

08:47.193 --> 08:48.778
No, I shot Santi's music video

08:48.778 --> 08:51.614
in addition to many, uh,
underground short films.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.282
Cool. Who was your DP on that?

08:54.033 --> 08:58.329
If you're gonna quiz me, I lit it,
I shot it, Soderbergh style, so me.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.455
- Yeah.
- [Ray] Got it.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.165
Felix, we're three hours behind.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.928
I'm not dishing out promotions
unless there's something in it for me.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.514
[laughs]

19:47.227 --> 19:49.062
Hey, what's up?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.273
Coming inside?

19:51.940 --> 19:52.774
In a second.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.445
Not really ready
to put on my boss bitch front

19:56.445 --> 19:58.322
for Ness and Santi yet.

19:59.156 --> 19:59.990
Oh.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.533
It's not a front.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.287
You're, like, the bossiest bitch around.

20:05.287 --> 20:09.082
No, it's because I know
how to pretend to be confident.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.626
Ah, well...

20:11.919 --> 20:13.420
wish I knew how to do that.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.466
Everyone in there is, like, doubting me,

20:18.383 --> 20:19.509
like little biatches.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.598
Probably 'cause I'm being a little biatch

20:24.598 --> 20:26.808
who doesn't know
how to make a creative decision

20:26.808 --> 20:28.852
and is inadvertently making fruit porn.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.187
Okay, Felix,

20:31.271 --> 20:33.273
please don't let this get to your head.

20:34.024 --> 20:34.858
[sighs]

20:34.858 --> 20:38.320
But I took a deep dive on to your YouTube.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.238
Uh-huh.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.574
And you are very talented.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.533
Uh-huh.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.870
- You have a very unique voice.
- No.

20:46.870 --> 20:47.996
- Yes.
- Enough.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.581
Shit. Can you say that again?

20:49.581 --> 20:52.626
I actually have
a compliments recording going.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.794
I'll write it down.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.545
Put it in my compliments folder.

20:55.545 --> 20:59.091
The man types. Thought
you were strictly a voice notes guy.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.844
Ah, I just figured it'd be easier for you.

21:04.012 --> 21:07.516
Since you're, like, always
on your computer all day, you're like,

21:07.516 --> 21:11.103
uh, reading, reading, reading,
typing, typing, typing.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.898
Just might be nice to listen instead.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.110
[clicks tongue]

21:19.361 --> 21:21.655
That is very nice of you, Felix.
Thank you.

21:22.781 --> 21:26.118
Hey, listen, I know you're not
feeling like peak Mia right now,

21:26.118 --> 21:27.828
but you should come inside.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.832
Santi and Ness would love to see you
and they definitely think

21:32.541 --> 21:35.627
you're the bossiest bitch around.
A boss bitch.

21:37.796 --> 21:41.133
You're a big... You're a huge bitch,
and they just--

21:41.133 --> 21:42.968
- You can stop talking.
- Yeah.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.885
[laughs]

21:46.471 --> 21:48.307
[music playing over headphones]

21:49.891 --> 21:51.393
Uh, Santi?

21:54.187 --> 21:56.273
Are you a part of this Balvin thing too?

21:56.940 --> 21:58.025
What Balvin thing?

21:58.025 --> 22:01.778
I got a call that he's giving
a surprise performance in a grocery store.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.155
There is no Balvin thing.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.239
- [Celeste] Shit.
- Ness.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.908
- Can't keep doing that.
- This idiot read your piece,

22:06.908 --> 22:10.245
took it very personally,
and now it's spiraled out of control.

22:10.245 --> 22:14.166
I pretended to be a publicist
from J Balvin's team to get you here.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.251
I don't like that you have my number.

22:16.251 --> 22:20.422
And I don't like how you don't understand
the hierarchies of <i>Scooby-Doo.</i> So...

22:20.422 --> 22:21.590
What the fuck?

22:24.134 --> 22:26.928
Hey, thanks for the,
uh, pretentious write-up

22:26.928 --> 22:30.432
that repeatedly calls me
childish and unprofessional.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.059
I'm...

22:32.059 --> 22:34.770
- I'm not pretentious.
- Nah, come on.

[in normal voice] Thank you,
Meghan Markle.

22:41.693 --> 22:46.656
Okay, you do know that Meghan Markle
famously is not British, right?

22:46.656 --> 22:48.658
Now you know who is and isn't British?

22:49.284 --> 22:50.619
[softly] Pretentious.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.037
Wow.

22:52.746 --> 22:53.622
This is...

22:53.622 --> 22:55.332
Yeah, it's definitely a new one.

22:55.916 --> 22:59.544
I get a lot of insults, pretty much daily,
but never pretentious.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.423
I've had people call me
stupid, untalented...

23:03.423 --> 23:04.758
Um, what else?

23:04.758 --> 23:08.428
Oh, yeah, most recently,
"That stupid bitch be writing a blog

23:08.428 --> 23:10.555
when she should be
writing a suicide note."

23:10.555 --> 23:12.891
Jesus fucking Christ. What?

23:13.683 --> 23:14.851
People really say that?

23:14.851 --> 23:15.769
Yeah.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.772
And what did you say back?

23:18.772 --> 23:20.190
Nothing.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.358
I'm trying to hustle.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.444
Not gonna waste my time
giving a shit what other people say.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.701
Look, maybe I was a little harsh,

23:31.701 --> 23:34.996
but it's not really much of a write-up
to say, "This guy's good."

23:35.622 --> 23:38.458
Because you are. And everyone knows that.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.877
Being young is a part of your appeal.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.839
The earlier you start,
the higher you can go.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.386

people were talking shit about?

[chuckling]

23:51.221 --> 23:53.140
Yeah, it is. It's...

23:53.140 --> 23:54.975
got me fired a couple of times now.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.394
Why am I listening to you
if that got you fired?

23:57.394 --> 23:58.562
Oh.

Uh, guys.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.296
There was a lot of stuff
I wanted to do with this video.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.841
A lot of it, in retrospect,
was overly ambitious.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.344
The GoPro shopping cart,
the multiple crane shots,

24:31.344 --> 24:35.182
Santi dancing with the Selena hologram,
all of it...

24:36.475 --> 24:37.309
bullshit.
