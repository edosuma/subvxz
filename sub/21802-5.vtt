00:13.400 --> 00:16.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Hayley Woods.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.480
Stop. You're embarrassing me.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.360
- Good job on bringing her back.
- I barely did anything.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.000
- She practically jumped in the car.
- No, I didn't!

00:25.080 --> 00:27.400
I swear I never saw
someone pack a bag so quickly.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.600
She pretty much waited at the window
for me to show up.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.840
Liar.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.760
Hey, Alex. I saw Leo and Hayley
in the driveway. She's back.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.160
- Really?
- Yes.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
Thanks.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.200
- One, two, three!
- Eagles!

01:13.760 --> 01:16.840
Our job was to describe
Sheriff Woody in one word.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.880
The word I chose is cowboy.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.240
I think every leader needs to be
a bit of a cowboy.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.200
You know, a tough, protective sheriff
that gets lonely sometimes.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.920
That's what Woody is.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.280
Who could lead those toys better
than him? The Slinky Dog?

01:34.360 --> 01:35.400
Mr. Potato Head?

01:35.480 --> 01:38.600
Don't you dare insult Mr. Potato Head.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.840
Woody always recognized the danger
before the rest of the toys,

01:41.920 --> 01:45.880
and he always took responsibility
at the right moment.

01:45.960 --> 01:48.080
I have a little confession to make.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.720
I only saw the movie
for the first time today.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.960
And I'd also like to thank Max

01:53.040 --> 01:57.120
for organizing a very special
VIP screening for me.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.480
So the first word
I thought of was friendship,

02:00.560 --> 02:04.040
because this is a movie
about a friendship between two leaders.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.240
One leader being older
and more experienced,

02:09.360 --> 02:12.360
and the other being new and fresh.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.960
At first, Woody thinks
he's going to be the leader forever,

02:18.040 --> 02:19.640
but then Buzz Lightyear comes along,

02:19.720 --> 02:22.960
and he realizes he isn't
as perfect as he thought.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.040
Hayward! Take a break on the bench.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.920
- What?
- Woods, you warmed up?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.680
- You need to get in there.
- Coach, I'm fine.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.520
There's just two minutes left.
Let me finish this game.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.120
No way. Go on, Alex.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.080
Woody was willing
to sacrifice Buzz to stay the leader,

02:39.160 --> 02:42.200
but he realized his mistake
as soon as he did so.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.080
That's why the word I chose is humility.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.520
I think Woody only became a true leader
once he was able to admit to his mistake.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.960
Well, hurry up already!

02:57.320 --> 02:58.440
Sorry, Coach.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.480
If Daniel says he's fine,
he should be in the game.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.560
Go on.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.680
- Thanks, Coach.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.920
As soon as he did that,
not only did he earn his role,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.520
he also earned a friend for life.
That's what leadership means to me.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.040
Stop it.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.200
Stop it.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.760
Eagles! Eagles!
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

03:28.440 --> 03:32.960
- Now, if he makes both shots, we win this.
- My son's clutch. He won't miss.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.680
All right!

03:48.400 --> 03:50.360
Come on, Daniel! Just one more, bro!

03:54.400 --> 03:56.400
Come on. Come on.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.680
The Eagles win the game!

04:04.280 --> 04:08.920
Eagles!
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

04:09.000 --> 04:10.440
I'll never forget this, Alex.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.080
- Daniel?
- Daniel?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.959
- Daniel?
- Daniel!

04:18.640 --> 04:20.600
- Daniel!
- It's okay.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.560
Daniel, can you hear me?

04:53.200 --> 04:57.200
I know I said it already, but thanks.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.040
- It was nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.120
It was a big deal.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.640
Why did you do it?

05:05.440 --> 05:07.560
We're Ravens.
We're supposed to help each other out.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.880
Okay, so I owe you now.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.240
Breakfast in bed for a week?

05:13.320 --> 05:17.080
No, thanks. I would get crumbs
in my bed and then ants.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.920
Okay, I'll clean up afterwards.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.200
It's okay, you don't owe me anything.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.160
Yeah, but that's not how it works.
You do me a favor, I do you a favor.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.640
I'll still figure something out.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.920
Guys, you wouldn't believe
what just happened at the Eagles game.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.280
What happened?

05:36.360 --> 05:38.600
He'll be fine, Judy.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.400
I know Dr. Schwartz well.
He's in good hands.

05:40.480 --> 05:45.560
I just don't understand how a strong,
healthy boy just collapses like that.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.280
The important thing is he comes
out of the operation safe and sound.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.880
And didn't you suspect anything?

05:51.960 --> 05:54.560
I knew he was going through something,
and I chose to ignore it.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.120
Now look what happened.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.360
Hey, don't blame yourself, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.640
I should've insisted
he tell me the truth.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.720
The doctor's here. I'll call you later.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.320
Okay, cool. Keep me posted, okay?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.360
Dr. Schwartz, how's my son?

06:08.440 --> 06:11.480
He's in recovery. He's still unconscious,
but there's no need to worry.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.840
- And his leg?
- It's too early to tell.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.920
It all depends on the damage done
by the Taser barb we pulled out.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.880
Taser barb? What are you talking about?

06:21.960 --> 06:24.040
That was the cause of the infection.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.960
Judging by its severity, the barb
had been there for several days.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.560
- Did you know about this?
- No.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.640
In any case, I have
to notify the police.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.120
The police? Why?

06:36.200 --> 06:39.040
It's standard procedure
with Taser-related wounds.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.680
- Um... can I see him?
- Yes, of course.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.520
Dad, we need to talk.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.240
So he's in the hospital now?
I can't believe it.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.760
Come on, guys! Let's party!

06:55.840 --> 06:57.920
That's what the Eagles get
for messing with us!

06:58.000 --> 07:00.800
Please turn the music off.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.480
I said, turn the music off!

07:06.640 --> 07:09.320
What is wrong with you people? How can
you celebrate something like that?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.680
If this happened to us,
the Eagles would do the same thing.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.320
Yeah, have you forgotten how they
made you look like a ninja turtle?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.720
That's exactly my point.
We're not like them.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.360
I'm going to their clubhouse
to see if they need help.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.680
Are you guys coming?

07:27.760 --> 07:30.920
- So you knew this whole time?
- I told you, I wasn't sure.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.600
No, you told me you saw him
throwing the Taser into the ocean.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.440
But I was so far away,
it was hard to tell what it was.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.960
- He told me it was just a rock.
- I did not raise you to be this gullible!

07:41.040 --> 07:42.280
Anything else you haven't told me?

07:42.360 --> 07:44.520
Some small detail that might
complicate things even further?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.000
I can't believe you
still think I'm lying.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.000
That's what happens
when you betray someone's trust.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.400
And you could have saved your friends

07:50.480 --> 07:52.440
the trouble of taking
unnecessary polygraph tests.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.800
- This already hurts enough as it is.
- Don't you see how this makes us look?

07:55.880 --> 07:57.440
Having the Taser on Greenhouse premises?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.200
Can you imagine
what that will do to the school?

07:59.760 --> 08:02.600
- You're worried about your reputation.
- I'm worried about you, Brooke!

08:02.680 --> 08:05.320
If the barb matches the Taser
the FBI found on the beach,

08:05.400 --> 08:06.560
they'll arrest you both.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
Me?

08:08.520 --> 08:12.080
You're a witness who remained silent.
That makes you Daniel's accomplice.

08:16.320 --> 08:20.160
He's the captain of the basketball team.
Honor roll. Very popular, too.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.040
So why is he walking around
with a Taser injury?

08:22.120 --> 08:23.480
It's a good question.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.040
Well, you let me know as soon as that
barb comes out of the lab, all right?

08:27.120 --> 08:29.960
Do you really think he has anything
to do with that missing park ranger?

08:30.040 --> 08:32.000
How many Tasers do you think
are lying around that beach?

08:32.960 --> 08:35.360
The moment we establish a match
with the park ranger's Taser,

08:35.440 --> 08:37.360
you call that kid in for questioning.
You got it?

08:37.440 --> 08:38.520
Mmm-hmm.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.000
So you were able to get
everything out?

08:42.080 --> 08:43.080
Yes.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.880
Your son is in great physical shape,

08:45.960 --> 08:48.880
so I'm confident he'll recover
in no time at all.

08:49.640 --> 08:53.880
Of course he will. Thanks to
your brilliant surgical skills.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.200
What about the, uh, Taser barb?
I'd like to see it.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.200
That's an odd request.

09:01.920 --> 09:05.080
Oh, well, I'm... I'm just curious
to know what injured my son.

09:05.160 --> 09:08.800
Well, even if I wanted to show it
to you, I can't. It's classified.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
I see.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.040
You know, I really can't
thank you enough.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.800
In fact, I...
I may want to make a contribution.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.280
You know,
I'm very devoted to fund-raising.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.040
I'm behind the new gym
at the Greenhouse Academy

09:27.120 --> 09:29.080
- where Daniel attends.
- Oh.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.720
I would love to sponsor you
in any of your endeavors.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.120
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're trying to bribe me.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.400
Anyway, the evidence
is already on its way

09:39.480 --> 09:41.160
to the lab for analysis.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.440
Oh, sorry. I didn't want to interrupt.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.480
The vending machine
had Daniel's favorite flavor.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.600
Daniel.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.360
Daniel, can you hear me?

10:05.280 --> 10:06.360
Hey.

10:10.640 --> 10:14.240
Let me guess,
the Eagles didn't let you in.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.480
Of course not. But I did talk to Sophie.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.040
They found a Taser barb in Daniel's leg.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.320
God, that's awful. How did it get there?

10:25.320 --> 10:27.640
Do you think that has to do
with what the FBI was looking for?

10:28.240 --> 10:29.600
Kind of a coincidence, don't you think?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.680
Okay, Leo, but it's his problem now.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.880
Do you realize what'll happen
if the FBI finds out

10:35.960 --> 10:37.760
that Daniel's connected to all this?

10:37.840 --> 10:40.000
It'll mean a criminal investigation.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.720
Louis will have to kick
him out of the school.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.360
So? That's good news, right?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.840
I don't know. It's bad
for the Greenhouse.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.320
Come on.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.560
Where we going?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.560
Follow me.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.120
Jackie?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.160
You wanna play chess?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.680
Becca?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.280
No.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.280
Emma! Do you want to play chess with me?

11:12.880 --> 11:13.960
Um...

11:14.040 --> 11:15.240
I already asked Jackie and she was...

11:15.320 --> 11:16.440
She never wants to play, actually,

11:16.520 --> 11:18.280
but Becca seems to be zoning out,
and I really...

11:18.360 --> 11:20.600
All right. All right, I'll play.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.160
Yes!

11:24.120 --> 11:25.680
So, have you ever played chess before?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.360
A few times.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.040
Well, if you have any
questions, just ask.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.960
You go first because it's white.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.880
Not bad.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.120
What?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.360
English open. Not bad.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.560
You know,
I've been playing since I was four.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.400
My grandpa and I used to play for hours.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.120
I once calculated that I've played

11:50.200 --> 11:52.240
three times as much as Kasparov did
when he was my age.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.040
Kasparov?

11:54.120 --> 11:55.560
Garry Kasparov.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.600
The greatest chess player of all time.

11:58.680 --> 12:03.360
So you're basically saying you're better
than the best chess player of all time?

12:04.480 --> 12:07.080
Wow. Losing to you would be an honor.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
Thank you.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.200
Interesting.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.640
I didn't expect that.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.120
It was about two weeks ago.
I was out on my morning run.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.880
And that's when I found the Taser.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.280
It was stupid to pick it up, I know.
But I was curious.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.400
What were you thinking?

12:57.480 --> 12:58.960
Go on.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.000
And then it hit my leg.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.880
I didn't want to get into trouble.
I panicked.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.440
I was going to give it to you, I swear.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.520
But then the FBI showed up
and I panicked again.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.800
So I threw it into the ocean.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.400
I'm disappointed
by your poor judgment, Daniel.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.920
Dad, stop! Can't you see
he's in enough pain already?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.720
It's good he's in pain.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.960
- Judy, how can you say that?
- She's right.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.600
I screwed up big-time.
I'm so sorry, Louis.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.800
Unfortunately,
I'm not your biggest problem.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.840
It's the FBI that you
should be worried about.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.320
You can't touch that. I checked you.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.600
Right, you... did.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.160
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.400
Is that checkmate?

14:35.080 --> 14:36.760
Did you checkmate me?

14:38.720 --> 14:40.600
The last time an amateur player
checkmated me

14:40.680 --> 14:42.160
was at the Poughkeepsie Chess Fair
last year.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.400
- That was because I had the measles.
- Good game, Kasparov.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.720
Who knew quiet girl was
such a con artist?

15:02.800 --> 15:06.440
No, she's not a con artist.
She's... amazing.

15:09.160 --> 15:13.840
Someone once told me the best way
to let out anger... is to play music.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.960
Do I look angry?

15:16.680 --> 15:18.680
You kinda do.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.520
Come on. Play something for me.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.280
Louder!

15:32.600 --> 15:34.000
Yes!

15:35.840 --> 15:37.000
Whoo!

15:40.200 --> 15:42.080
Okay, maybe I was a little angry.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.440
Okay.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.320
- Hey, Daniel woke up.
- Hmm.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.120
Sophie blogged that the doctor says
he's out of danger.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.800
All right. Okay, I
just spoke with Perry.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.520
- And what did the lab say?
- Well, Perry never made it to the lab.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.240
He's fine, thank God.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.720
- But his car overheated.
- What?

16:22.800 --> 16:25.040
He was lucky to run out of the car
just before the car exploded.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.320
Oh, my God. Wait, what
about the evidence?

16:27.400 --> 16:30.080
All the evidence is gone.
The fire destroyed everything.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.800
- I can still question the kid.
- Well, that won't help us now.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.320
We have nothing to link him
with the missing park ranger.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.280
We're at another dead end.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.640
- All gone, Judy.
- Are you sure?

16:55.720 --> 16:56.920
Mmm-hmm.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.520
Good. I knew I could count on you.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.160
Are you googling Emma?

17:10.920 --> 17:12.960
I'm just researching
her background

17:13.040 --> 17:14.560
to know what I'm up against.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.800
She uses techniques
that I've never seen before.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.160
Yeah, I bet you like her techniques.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.960
Yeah. No. What? No!
I just respect her as an opponent.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.760
What?

17:25.839 --> 17:29.240
Come on, Maximilian. I'm here to
help you. I told you I owe you one.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.720
What do you mean?

17:31.840 --> 17:33.360
I know you like Emma,

17:33.440 --> 17:35.600
and I am going to help you
get a date with her.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.840
- All right. Ready?
- Okay. Ready.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.480
Okay, just...

17:42.560 --> 17:43.800
- Okay.
- Okay?

17:43.880 --> 17:45.240
Okay.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.800
All right, these are gonna take
some getting used to.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.520
- You got it. Come on. Come on.
- Mmm, okay.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.360
Okay.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.000
Okay, okay, not so fast.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.240
- I don't want him to fall.
- I got it, Ma.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.440
I just spoke with the FBI.
It's your lucky day, Daniel.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.800
- What?
- Case is closed.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.840
There was some kind of an accident
and the evidence is all gone.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.440
Wow!

18:11.080 --> 18:13.400
That's... Wow!

18:14.040 --> 18:16.680
Wait, what accident, Dad?
I don't understand.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.480
- Who cares? Right, Mom?
- Yeah.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.440
What a break.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.920
Louis, I will never let you down again.
I promise.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.440
I believe you.
But as a leader, you failed miserably.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.920
Now, I appreciate all the contributions
you've made to the Greenhouse,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.120
and that's why I won't expel you.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.120
But you'll no longer be
captain of the Eagles.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.080
You know,
something just don't make sense here.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.840
Where exactly were you
when the car caught fire?

18:48.920 --> 18:53.320
I already told you. Black smoke
from the motor came out of the AC vent.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.480
I stopped the car
and got out 'cause I was choking.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.560
And then, boom, the car exploded.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.800
So why didn't you take the evidence
with you when you got out of the car?

19:00.880 --> 19:03.120
It all happened so fast.
I wasn't thinking.

19:04.920 --> 19:05.960
I'm sorry, boss.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.360
That was a close one, wasn't it?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.160
Yeah, acting's not for you.
Don't quit your day job.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.160
Don't spend it all at once.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.360
So, what's your deal with Daniel?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.800
What deal?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.480
You know...

19:42.560 --> 19:44.480
We both have a job to be the best.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.520
And often it comes
at each other's expense.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.560
I respect him.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.880
Cool.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.080
Okay, don't get me wrong.
I can't stand the guy.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.560
But you care about him.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.720
And I think it's great
that you feel that way.

19:58.800 --> 20:02.640
It's just that I want to keep beating him
'cause he's a worthy opponent, you know?

20:02.720 --> 20:04.040
It's completely professional.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.920
Yeah, totally.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.800
I mean, you hate him so much
that you kind of like him.

20:07.880 --> 20:08.800
Will you stop it?

20:10.440 --> 20:14.680
Look, I just want you to admit that you're
not only sensitive, but you're also nice.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.360
Nice?
Now you're just getting carried away.
