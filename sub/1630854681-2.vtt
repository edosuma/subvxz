14:00.943 --> 14:04.395
Okay. We have what,
10 RSVPs, right?

14:04.429 --> 14:07.260
-Yes, baby.
-Okay, perfect.

14:07.294 --> 14:10.332
Oh, and I ordered the masks
and a few other toys

14:10.366 --> 14:12.196
for some fun.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.404
-Ooh, toys.

14:13.438 --> 14:14.612
You know what I like.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.407
I do.

14:16.441 --> 14:21.481
And I know just what you like.

14:22.309 --> 14:24.691
[ Chuckles ]

14:24.725 --> 14:26.175
Damn, girl.

14:26.210 --> 14:28.074
You sucking on that shit
just right.

14:28.108 --> 14:29.282
-Yo.
-How the fuck

14:29.316 --> 14:30.662
did he get in here?

14:30.697 --> 14:32.112
-I done told you --
-You know Mona had to

14:32.147 --> 14:33.631
make sure this shit was real.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.495
How'd you get past
security, Lavar?

14:35.529 --> 14:38.636
You know I know people.
That ain't hard at all.

14:40.465 --> 14:42.915
What can we do for you, Lavar?

14:42.951 --> 14:44.642
Just had a few stops
in the neighborhood.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.058
Oh, well, perhaps we can chat
another time.

14:47.093 --> 14:49.543
All right?
Get the fuck out of here.

14:49.578 --> 14:52.339
[ Laughs ] Nah, I think we can
chat right now.

14:52.374 --> 14:55.101
My captain's still on lock down.

14:55.135 --> 14:57.413
I thought you said you was
gonna take care of that.

14:57.448 --> 15:00.623
I did. And I am.

15:00.658 --> 15:05.352
But to be clear, your boy was
picked up with a lot of weight.

15:05.387 --> 15:06.595
[ Chuckles ]

15:06.629 --> 15:08.942
Since you're
in the neighborhood,

15:08.977 --> 15:11.565
you got that package I ask for?

15:11.600 --> 15:15.397
Nah, man. No, I don't.
You told Mona yet?

15:15.431 --> 15:19.194
Yo, you are worried
about the wrong thing.

15:19.228 --> 15:21.541
Man, what the fuck
you got going on?

15:21.575 --> 15:25.096
Hey, why don't we invite Lavar
to the party

15:25.131 --> 15:26.339
so can see for himself?

15:26.373 --> 15:29.273
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
I like parties.

15:29.307 --> 15:32.448
Um, I'll pick up
the package tomorrow.

15:32.483 --> 15:34.381
Don't even worry
about that, bro.

15:34.415 --> 15:35.969
I'll drop it off
while you're at work.

15:36.004 --> 15:39.040
Okay, look.

15:39.076 --> 15:42.424
Do not make me
get out of character

15:42.458 --> 15:43.770
in front of the lady.

15:43.804 --> 15:45.668
[ Laughs ]

15:47.429 --> 15:51.329
Man, enjoy y'all little
fufu ass lunch.

15:51.364 --> 15:54.298
See ya, Syleena.

15:54.332 --> 15:57.508
O.M.G., Gina!
Are you coming back

15:57.542 --> 15:59.096
on the next season for
"Ballin'"?

15:59.130 --> 16:01.581
-Maybe.
-I love you.

16:01.615 --> 16:03.238
I'll be back to get your order.

16:03.272 --> 16:05.654
Aw, thank you.

16:05.688 --> 16:07.725
Fans. Can't live with them.

16:07.759 --> 16:11.039
-Can't live without them.
-Can't live without them.

16:11.073 --> 16:12.730
Okay. Be honest.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.490
Why haven't they
renewed my contract?

16:14.525 --> 16:16.216
Look, the producers feel

16:16.251 --> 16:18.287
that you wasn't that forthcoming
this season.

16:18.322 --> 16:21.152
Not to mention the other girl's
social media followers

16:21.187 --> 16:22.602
have skyrocketed.

16:22.636 --> 16:24.017
-More followers?
-Yes.

16:24.052 --> 16:25.398
Are you serious?

16:25.432 --> 16:26.709
Why does it feel
like everybody's trying

16:26.744 --> 16:28.573
to bring me down?

16:28.608 --> 16:30.437
This is so fucked up.

16:30.472 --> 16:32.715
I'm the one
who put "Ballin'" on the map.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.614
Not to mention, I'm the only one
that's married

16:34.648 --> 16:37.548
to a star player.

16:37.582 --> 16:40.033
A piece of shit, but a star.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.208
These bum bitches, all they do
is bend over

16:42.242 --> 16:45.418
and twerk for some tickets and
throw a dude up on their Gram.

16:45.452 --> 16:46.833
You know
this shit is fucked up.

16:46.867 --> 16:48.524
That's what I told them.

16:48.559 --> 16:52.080
That you are a star and you
deserve to have your own.

16:52.114 --> 16:54.806
But they want Julio,
and he won't do it.

16:54.841 --> 16:56.567
They see the pull back from you.

16:56.601 --> 16:59.535
They feel that he's detaching
you from the spotlight.

16:59.570 --> 17:02.780
Fuck, why does it feel like
Julio's controlling my life?

17:02.814 --> 17:06.404
You're way too smart for that.
Way too smart to be controlled.

17:06.439 --> 17:08.165
Hate to say it.

17:08.199 --> 17:10.374
I've been telling you
that you need to have your own.

17:10.407 --> 17:12.238
How? And with what?
You just finished telling me

17:12.271 --> 17:14.618
they want to get me
off of "Ballin'"

17:14.654 --> 17:18.106
And plus, if it was up to Julio,
I'd be home, knocked up,

17:18.140 --> 17:19.589
pushing out babies
left to right,

17:19.624 --> 17:21.799
and at his beck and call
for 24 hours a day.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.698
Bitch, what you need
is your own show.

17:24.733 --> 17:26.700
-My own show?
-Yes!

17:26.734 --> 17:29.186
We can even dive
into Julio's cheating

17:29.220 --> 17:31.084
to make it more interesting.

17:31.119 --> 17:32.741
He's not even
doing that anymore.

17:32.775 --> 17:34.294
Can you believe it?

17:34.329 --> 17:36.814
He's out here
acting like a fucking saint.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.885
Be creative.

17:38.919 --> 17:40.749
Creating a the story line
around the rumors

17:40.783 --> 17:42.889
could be something
to start this season.

17:42.923 --> 17:45.236
Unless you can think
of something better.

17:45.271 --> 17:49.309
Shh. I'm thinking.

17:49.344 --> 17:53.417
Okay, I just need to add,
we need salacious.

17:53.451 --> 17:54.521
-Yes.
-Scandalous.

17:54.556 --> 17:56.282
-Ooh.
-Something so juicy

17:56.316 --> 17:59.871
that people will miss
they Grandma's funeral to watch.

17:59.906 --> 18:03.116
If not, it may be time to hang
up your reality career.

18:03.151 --> 18:04.807
Bitch, never.

18:04.842 --> 18:06.706
Then come up with a story line

18:06.740 --> 18:08.466
that will leave them
wanting more.

18:08.501 --> 18:10.710
From there, the sky
is the limit.

18:10.744 --> 18:13.126
You can become your own brand.

18:13.161 --> 18:17.268
And I'm not pushing you
to this topic, but affairs sell.

18:17.303 --> 18:18.821
So.

18:22.273 --> 18:25.794
Well, there is an affair.

18:29.418 --> 18:31.179
It's just not Julio's.

18:39.532 --> 18:42.224
Listen, Cherise,
thank you so much

18:42.259 --> 18:45.331
for seeing me unannounced.

18:45.365 --> 18:48.817
I didn't think I'd see your face
after that shit show last month.

18:48.851 --> 18:55.203
Yeah, I heard about that.
I think you said I shit the bed.

18:55.237 --> 18:57.205
And I was being generous.

18:57.239 --> 19:00.484
Well, I'll admit
that I was caught off guard

19:00.518 --> 19:03.763
by Chris' vilification,
but it won't happen again.

19:03.797 --> 19:05.627
You're right. It won't.

19:05.661 --> 19:08.319
I was off my game. Okay?

19:08.354 --> 19:10.183
I mean, you were
absolutely right.

19:10.218 --> 19:14.877
I should have been prepared
to talk about Marissa's murder.

19:14.912 --> 19:16.914
Testifying at Maxwell's trial

19:16.948 --> 19:21.815
was one of the lowest points
of my life.

19:21.850 --> 19:26.682
I mean, it took me
to a really, really dark place.

19:26.717 --> 19:30.721
I started drinking
just to numb the pain.

19:30.755 --> 19:35.622
Yes, I've heard some stories
floating around.

19:35.657 --> 19:41.732
But now I am just trying
to restructure

19:41.766 --> 19:44.804
my life, my career.

19:44.838 --> 19:48.428
So please, all of that,
it was on me.

19:52.398 --> 19:54.676
Here's my two year chip.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.713
Wow. I, um -- I had no idea.

19:57.748 --> 20:00.371
I get it. Shit gets tough.

20:00.406 --> 20:04.410
But you can't handle
all this stuff on your own.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.032
Have you attended
any AA meetings?

20:06.066 --> 20:09.277
[ Scoffs ] No. I --

20:09.311 --> 20:13.833
Thank you for sharing,
but I'm going to stop on my own.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.835
I ran with that story
for 10 years

20:15.869 --> 20:18.286
before I could face
the hard facts.

20:18.320 --> 20:21.668
I needed help.
I was literally drowning.

20:22.704 --> 20:25.603
Attend a meeting.

20:26.397 --> 20:29.435
So, where do we go from here,
Dr. Logan?

20:29.469 --> 20:35.613
That is a good question,
and why I'm here.

20:38.098 --> 20:41.343
I wanted to give you this.

20:41.964 --> 20:46.348
It is the manuscript
for my new book,

20:46.383 --> 20:50.041
"Born to Cheat: Why Men and
Women Can't Be Monogamous,

20:50.076 --> 20:53.873
But They Can Stay Married."

20:53.907 --> 20:57.290
Wasn't Marissa cheating
on her husband?

20:57.325 --> 21:04.021
Cherise, you know, I cannot
discuss any of that with you.

21:04.055 --> 21:07.887
But I'm going to cover
that topic in my book.

21:07.921 --> 21:10.752
Actually, you know,
I shouldn't be telling you this,

21:10.786 --> 21:15.446
but I've launched a really
unorthodox research project,

21:15.481 --> 21:20.417
and I am going to blow the lid
off of female sexuality

21:20.451 --> 21:24.938
and the myth of monogamy.

21:24.973 --> 21:30.323
I call it
"The Penthouse Project."

21:30.358 --> 21:33.637
If this book is successful,
we may be able to get that

21:33.671 --> 21:35.915
talk show back on the table.

21:45.476 --> 21:46.926
Geez.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.031
Thanks, my G.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.792
You seen Miss Mona Dee?

21:50.826 --> 21:53.484
Ah, I see you brought my bitch.

21:53.519 --> 21:57.730
What up, Mona? How you doing?
I like your outfit.

21:57.764 --> 21:59.525
I bet you do.

21:59.559 --> 22:03.011
So Lavar tells me that you got
some special requests.

22:03.045 --> 22:05.876
Yes, I do. We're having a party.

22:05.910 --> 22:09.466
What I didn't realize is we got
a snitch ass bitch on the team.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.400
Snitch? Nigga, I'm about
sick of your fucking mouth.

22:12.434 --> 22:14.471
Lavar, stay focused, okay?

22:14.505 --> 22:16.714
Yeah, nephew. Stay focused.

22:16.749 --> 22:18.854
Beat your ass, nigga.

22:18.889 --> 22:23.031
So, what does my product
you have to do with your party?

22:23.065 --> 22:24.757
Good question.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.137
So I can't really give out
all the details,

22:26.172 --> 22:28.381
but just know this party
is going to set us up

22:28.416 --> 22:29.934
something real lovely.

22:29.969 --> 22:31.453
You just got to trust us,
Mona Dee.

22:31.488 --> 22:34.007
In God. we trust.
All others, cash.

22:34.042 --> 22:36.424
I trust you as far as I can
throw your ass.

22:36.458 --> 22:37.977
Turn around. Let me see it.

22:38.011 --> 22:40.393
Yeah, that's what the fuck
I'm talking about!

22:40.428 --> 22:43.120
Shut your damn mouth, Lavar.

22:43.154 --> 22:45.640
So, Syleena, you know, this is
a lot more than that little shit

22:45.674 --> 22:47.435
you used to do for Link
back in the day.

22:47.469 --> 22:48.953
You sure you can handle this?

22:48.988 --> 22:51.059
Come on, Mona. You know our
girl's smart with it.

22:51.093 --> 22:52.819
Man, fuck this nigga!

22:52.854 --> 22:55.028
He ain't even got my mans
out yet, Dee.

22:55.063 --> 22:56.720
He playing' you for real, man.

22:56.754 --> 22:58.549
-Lavar.
-Man, fuck that. We playin'?

22:58.584 --> 22:59.895
I want to play with her.

22:59.930 --> 23:01.587
LaVar, carry your ass
to the office.

23:01.621 --> 23:03.105
Man, for real, auntie?

23:03.140 --> 23:04.590
You want to come, too, Syleena?

23:04.624 --> 23:05.867
I can show you
where I keep my blicky.

23:05.901 --> 23:08.559
-MONA: Now!
-LAVAR: Fuck this, man.

23:08.801 --> 23:10.975
Beat your ass, nigga.

23:11.976 --> 23:14.151
So, what the fuck does
my product

23:14.185 --> 23:15.877
got to do with your party?

23:15.911 --> 23:18.673
Well, because it's the best,
obviously.

23:18.707 --> 23:21.572
We want to feature
your product at our party.

23:21.607 --> 23:24.575
From this weekend,
is going to start the first

23:24.610 --> 23:27.509
of many high profile,

23:27.544 --> 23:31.064
highly secure masquerade
penthouse parties.

23:31.099 --> 23:32.756
Huh?

23:32.790 --> 23:34.861
Like she said, we can't tell you
everything right now,

23:34.896 --> 23:37.208
but if this goes well,

23:37.243 --> 23:38.831
it could be
a perfect opportunity

23:38.865 --> 23:40.729
to make some new friends.

23:40.764 --> 23:43.491
To be honest, this could be the
way you can move from the street

23:43.525 --> 23:47.184
to dealing party favors
for these rich motherfuckers.

23:47.218 --> 23:51.257
Nigga, does this look like
motherfucking party city to you?

23:51.291 --> 23:53.880
I don't run no fuckin' party
promotion business.

23:53.915 --> 23:56.642
But I do, and I can
promise you this is

23:56.676 --> 23:58.954
going to be an instant success.

23:58.989 --> 24:01.509
You know, I always deliver
for you, Mona.

24:01.543 --> 24:03.131
You know me.

24:03.165 --> 24:04.926
This ain't no different.

24:07.894 --> 24:11.208
You motherfuckers better
not be playin' me.

24:14.591 --> 24:17.594
Oh, and Lavar
want to fuck your bitch.

24:17.628 --> 24:20.735
So don't make me give that nigga
no green light to do so.

24:20.769 --> 24:24.221
Miss Mona Dee, if you knew
anything about me,

24:24.255 --> 24:26.844
you'd know there's two things
I don't play with --

24:26.879 --> 24:29.709
my money or my wife.

24:30.917 --> 24:33.057
MONA: All right then, nigga.

24:33.092 --> 24:34.127
You got it.

24:34.162 --> 24:35.508
Thank you.

24:35.543 --> 24:37.130
Good evening.

24:37.165 --> 24:39.201
Come on, baby, let's go.

24:42.722 --> 24:44.690
MONA: Lavar.

24:50.247 --> 24:52.801
Do we have a problem?

24:52.836 --> 24:54.285
