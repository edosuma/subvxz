WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.051
Thank you for coming to me.

00:09.134 --> 00:12.888
Ladies, lords.
Thank you for your pledges of support.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.057
Captain Gosset, how goes the count?

00:15.891 --> 00:19.561
Our outposts at Hareburr and Currlye
have pledged 25 soldiers.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.105
Lebnin has pledged an additional 30.

00:22.189 --> 00:26.944
Lebnin considers it an honor,
not just a duty, Your Majesty.

00:27.444 --> 00:31.323
I stand with you,
as my father stood with your father.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.160
When we combine that
with our Pennsan troops--

00:38.080 --> 00:42.167
Nothing from Altoona? Can that be so?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.378
Lord Diego, is it?

00:45.045 --> 00:49.258
Your Majesty, Altoona stands ready
with an additional 20 troops.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.010
Ten less than Lebnin.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.305
Your city is twice as populated.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.724
We are approaching the planting season.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.978
The town council felt that
the farmworkers must continue to plant,

01:01.061 --> 01:02.688
or we will face a shortage.

01:03.188 --> 01:08.026
Lord Diego, are you at all aware
of what transpired at Kanzua?

01:08.527 --> 01:10.779
We all heard tales of your suffering.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.951
Tell me, if I destroyed
your home in front of you,

01:17.077 --> 01:21.498
drowned everyone you knew and loved,
murdered your wife and your children,

01:22.124 --> 01:23.750
would you be worried about crops?

01:25.627 --> 01:27.296
My apologies, Your Highness.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.966
Perhaps we should
go to Altoona and find out.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.388
[signaling] The Trivantians made contact.
They wish to meet.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.266
Lord Diego, I ask again.
How many troops do you pledge?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.896
Thirty troops, my queen.

01:46.899 --> 01:47.900
Very well.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.946
Captain Gosset?

01:53.030 --> 01:55.782
The count continues
with chambers in Monroe.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.621
Do you ever imagine
the fire is speaking to you?

02:02.122 --> 02:05.876
When I was alone after Father died
and you disappeared,

02:06.710 --> 02:09.086
I swore it told me secrets.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.593
Why didn't you tell me
Trivantes requested a diplomatic summit?

02:14.676 --> 02:16.053
Because it doesn't matter.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.389
Imagine Father's reaction.

02:20.265 --> 02:24.770
The mighty Triangle frightened of me.
Begging me for peace.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.397
-We have to consider it.
-Why?

02:28.524 --> 02:32.152
We have righteousness on our side.
God leading the charge.

02:32.236 --> 02:37.491
Yeah, well, even so, on the battlefield,
the men must believe.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.660
-In God?
-In you.

02:41.119 --> 02:45.290
They must believe that their queen did
everything in her power to protect them.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.086
My men will do as they're commanded.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.255
Sibeth.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.969
A soldier must believe in his cause,
must believe in his queen,

02:57.052 --> 03:00.514
must love her to the point
that he would be willing to die for her.

03:03.392 --> 03:09.314
Imagine if you could stop Trivantes
from encroaching on our land

03:09.398 --> 03:12.568
without sacrificing a single soldier.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.946
You already have their obedience,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.449
but if you manage this,
you would have their love.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.996
It's never been done.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.375
Well, when was the last time
the Trivantians asked for a parley?

03:29.459 --> 03:31.545
-Never.
-That's right.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.633
Maybe having God on your side means…

03:37.843 --> 03:41.680
you win the war
without having to fight the battle.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.694
The Trivantians have no queen or king.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.238
I cannot negotiate
with common politicians.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.907
Of course not.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.994
But I can go as your emissary.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.748
As the princess and as your sister,
I can speak for you.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.964
Very well.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.723
Thank you, Sibeth.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.730
Of course, any treaty
will require a formal apology

04:32.231 --> 04:35.359
and reparations for the attack on Kanzua.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.947
What? You know that's not possible.

04:41.865 --> 04:46.703
We're going to win a war
without fighting a battle, are we not?

04:47.663 --> 04:49.915
I would say anything is possible.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.881
So you thought your wife was dead,
but she wasn't,

06:20.964 --> 06:22.925
and now you're about to be together again.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.929
you must be so excited.
I'm excited, and I've never even met her.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.681
Of course, it's complicated
now that she's a princess.

06:29.765 --> 06:31.099
Strange, isn't it?

06:31.183 --> 06:33.894
That she never once thought to mention
that she was a princess.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.940
It's hard not to think of an omission
like that as a lie of sorts.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.652
If I were you, I'd be thinking
the entire relationship was a lie.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.445
But you did raise two children together.

06:43.529 --> 06:46.073
It would be hard
to lie through all of that.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.618
I imagine if I were you,
I'd be very angry.

06:49.701 --> 06:54.164
Also, confused and nervous.
But also so happy that she's alive.

06:54.665 --> 06:57.000
Oh, I suppose I wouldn't know how to feel.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.586
What do I know?
I've never even been in love.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.172
Maybe that's 'cause you talk too much.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.114
I think it's dead.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.080
I could run drills with you.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.625
See how you do with something alive.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.298
I only fight soldiers.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.301
And bales of hay, apparently.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.137
Come on. It'll be fun. We--

07:54.224 --> 07:55.225
You're right.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.812
That was exhilarating. Thank you.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.828
I'm not going to risk the wrath
of the princess

08:14.912 --> 08:17.039
by putting a scratch on her boy.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.586
Now, go away.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.219
Toad!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.476
I couldn't save my sister.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.395
I couldn't help my dad.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.193
I need to be able to defend my family.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.988
I'm too used to having
other people do it for me.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.786
I'm sure the princess can appoint you
a proper trainer.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.623
You're right. I'll ask her to appoint you.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.759
And why me?

09:11.927 --> 09:13.679
Because we get along so well.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.808
I'm done training for the day.

09:31.947 --> 09:35.534
-General, sir.
-Lieutenant, come.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.132
-It's sharp.
-Yeah.

09:51.592 --> 09:54.386
Virgin steel.
Put through a new forging process.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.974
Wielded properly, it won't be stopped.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.977
I'm rearming the entire battalion.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.606
Here.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.067
This one is yours.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.321
I don't understand.

10:12.404 --> 10:16.033
Didn't the Triangle offer the Payans
an overture for peace?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.579
The queen doesn't
falsely accuse another nation

10:20.662 --> 10:22.831
unless she is looking for a fight.

10:22.915 --> 10:26.084
The peace talks will fail,
and we will make sure they do.

10:26.168 --> 10:29.630
You have been very vocal
with the Triangle.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.175
If something goes wrong,
they will lay the blame at your feet.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.511
Which is why you will go in my place.

10:38.263 --> 10:43.560
If there's a chance for peace with Paya,
shouldn't we try for it?

10:44.353 --> 10:47.397
As it is, we're overcommitted
on the western front fighting the Ganites.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.482
Wren.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.320
Wren.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.742
The Payan queen has grown bold.
She's forgotten who we are.

11:00.160 --> 11:06.166
It is in the best interest of the republic
that we remind her.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.770
All right. This way. Stay close.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.713
It's Tamacti Jun.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.635
Wait here.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.019
Go.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.149
I told you to wait
while I gather intelligence.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.525
Is she here or not?

12:13.609 --> 12:17.446
Princess Maghra is here and safe for now.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.823
You're not telling us something.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.077
She's with the queen.
That's all I know for certain.

12:24.786 --> 12:25.871
And Kofun?

12:25.954 --> 12:27.706
I've heard nothing.

12:27.789 --> 12:31.168
His Witchfinder escort was traveling
without the benefit of compass maps.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.378
Perhaps we arrived first.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.546
Let's go find her.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.215
Seek out the highest house.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.175
The queen will
have fortified herself there.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.343
You're not coming?

12:39.843 --> 12:42.971
The queen thinks I'm dead,
which is how it will have to stay for now.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.390
I need to make contact
with those Witchfinders loyal to me

12:45.474 --> 12:47.726
and be assured of their continued service.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.687
We'll need their support
if we're gonna confront the queen.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.234
-And how will we find you?
-I'll find you when it's time.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.862
Tread lightly with the queen.

12:58.946 --> 13:03.075
She's unlike anyone you've ever known,
and you're in her realm now.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.202
I can handle myself.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.205
Yes, but less well without your head.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.961
I still don't trust him.

13:15.379 --> 13:19.508
I do not either.
But he has made no false steps yet.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.886
We cannot travel in such a big group.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.097
Paris, you stay here with Charlotte.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.851
-We'll send for you once we find her.
-I must stay close to keep Haniwa safe.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.396
And who has kept Haniwa safe
for the last 17 years?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.022
Here.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.108
Keep that safe.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.486
Carefully, Baba.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.540
That must be it.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.305
She'll be very happy that we're here.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.602
-She's a princess now.
-She's still Mom.

14:13.187 --> 14:17.399
What if she's not?
What if being here has changed her?

14:20.152 --> 14:21.695
Then we'll rescue her.

14:34.208 --> 14:37.461
Two guards. Six steps.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.671
Guards, six steps.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.263
Identify yourself.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.724
I'm here for Princess Maghra.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.935
The princess does not
receive visitors at the palace.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.019
Move on.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.772
-She'll receive me.
-I said, move on!

15:02.694 --> 15:04.196
Haniwa!

15:06.657 --> 15:08.200
-Maghra!
-Mama!

15:09.409 --> 15:10.410
Stop!

15:12.913 --> 15:14.081
Dad! Dad!

15:16.458 --> 15:17.543
Stop!

15:18.919 --> 15:20.128
Stand down.

15:27.886 --> 15:28.887
Baba?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.932
No. A bear.

15:34.643 --> 15:35.811
I found you.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.020
I knew you would.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.030
-Mama.
-Haniwa.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.700
Oh, my girl.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.957
-I thought you were dead.
-It's all right. You're safe now.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.793
I found you. I found you.

15:59.877 --> 16:00.878
Maghra.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.464
You didn't tell me we were having company.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.677
Baba.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.599
This is Lord Harlan.

16:14.433 --> 16:18.395
-This is his house.
-Honey, please. Our house.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.108
-What?
-Baba. Listen to me.

16:23.192 --> 16:26.570
Baba? This is Baba Voss?

16:26.653 --> 16:27.654
I am.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.201
I'm Harlan, Lord of Pennsa,

16:33.577 --> 16:36.580
and this is awkward,
but I'm married to your wife.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.333
Baba. Come upstairs.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.961
-What is he talking about?
-Come upstairs, and I'll explain.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.005
Come.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.674
Yeah, let's all go upstairs.
Have a hot tea.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.802
You. You're gonna stop speaking.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.680
-Pretty unlikely.
-Not if I tear your throat out.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.766
And make our wife a widow?

16:55.849 --> 16:58.936
So, this is Baba Voss?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.021
Who is that?

17:02.064 --> 17:05.608
"Who's that?" Only your queen, that's all.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.613
Welcome, Baba Voss.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.700
And did I hear my sister call
Haniwa's name?

17:16.662 --> 17:18.579
[signaling] Please.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.624
I'm Haniwa.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.100
My prayers have been answered.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.688
My sister's family
returned to her unharmed.

17:45.649 --> 17:46.900
My babies.

17:48.861 --> 17:52.698
You must all join me for dinner.
We must toast your safe return.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.165
You think she means right now?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.629
The mighty Baba Voss.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.260
Your legend precedes you,
and you did not disappoint.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.847
You walked through my guards
like they were nothing but tall weeds.

18:17.389 --> 18:18.891
They didn't seem very tall.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.270
Some of the world's finest soldiers.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.815
You send them to hunt children.
There's no wonder they can't fight a man.

18:26.899 --> 18:27.900
Baba.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.570
It's fine, Maghra.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.865
He needn't be polite on my account.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.242
After all, we're all family here,
are we not?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.744
Hear, hear.

18:40.329 --> 18:45.209
Besides, as a former
Trivantian soldier and a Slaver,

18:45.292 --> 18:48.212
it's only fair to expect
a certain lack of table manners.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.546
Sibeth, please.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.508
Wait-- You're a Slaver?

18:53.509 --> 18:56.470
Seriously? Wow.

18:57.221 --> 18:59.306
I mean, not that I'm judging, but--

19:00.182 --> 19:02.935
-No, I am judging. A lot.
-You be quiet.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.937
Yes, Harlan.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.774
Be very quiet. Like a little mouse.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.442
I just find it so wonderfully ironic

19:10.526 --> 19:15.364
that a Payan princess would marry
a Slaver out of all people.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.366
Though I suppose
Jerlamarel didn't leave you

19:17.449 --> 19:19.826
much of a choice now, did he, Maghra?

19:19.910 --> 19:21.161
Abandoning you like that?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.830
I apologize, Lord Harlan,

19:23.914 --> 19:26.375
for discussing your wife's ex-lovers
in front of you.

19:26.458 --> 19:30.212
No, it's fine. It's fine.
We all have our pasts, don't we?

19:31.129 --> 19:34.341
For instance, this used to be my house.
Now it's yours.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.219
And the great dance continues.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.388
You make an interesting point.

19:40.514 --> 19:43.392
Since my birthright determined
my future from a young age,

19:43.475 --> 19:46.728
I have no excitingly
scandalous past to speak of.

19:46.812 --> 19:51.650
I suppose I envied Maghra, in a way.

19:52.985 --> 19:54.111
The freedom,

19:54.695 --> 19:57.614
selfish as it seemed,
to choose her own path

19:57.698 --> 20:01.618
with no regard for others,
no sense of responsibility for anyone--

20:01.702 --> 20:06.039
Respectfully, Your Majesty,
Maghra has devoted her life

20:06.123 --> 20:10.002
to loving her husband,
raising her children,

20:10.085 --> 20:12.379
and serving the Alkenny people.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.090
Respectfully, mountain woman…

20:16.633 --> 20:20.304
it is because of my sister that
the Alkenny are traitors to the crown.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.264
The Alkenny cannot be traitors
to the crown.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.932
The Alkenny people are no more.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.560
If a hidden tribe disappears,
how are we to even know?

20:26.643 --> 20:27.769
Enough.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.358
Our father forbade the discussion

20:33.442 --> 20:37.154
of politics at the table
for a very good reason.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.655
Well said, my dear.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.743
-Who'd like more wine?
-I would.

20:43.744 --> 20:44.745
It's funny.

20:45.454 --> 20:49.166
When we were children, I was the romantic.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.587
Maghra always swore she'd never marry,
and yet, here we are.

20:54.296 --> 20:57.382
I'm the spinster, and she has
two husbands at this table alone.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.679
I meant no offense, Baba Voss.

21:02.763 --> 21:07.226
I love my sister dearly, even though
she's lied to me, betrayed me.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.936
[signaling]
You are my husband. I love only you.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.271
I would still kill or die for her.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.941
I imagine it's the same with you.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.735
Oh, and you, of course, Lord Harlan.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.447
It's an honor to be in such fine company.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.891
Do you recognize my voice, soldier?

22:42.946 --> 22:46.033
I couldn't possibly because you're dead.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.827
Only on the inside.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.876
The queen said you took your own life.

22:57.669 --> 23:02.674
The queen has always had
a troubled relationship with the truth,

23:02.758 --> 23:04.092
wouldn't you say?

23:06.929 --> 23:08.180
Not out loud.

23:15.229 --> 23:20.234
So… what happens now?

23:23.779 --> 23:25.030
What indeed?

23:34.790 --> 23:36.542
Kofun, Haniwa,

23:37.459 --> 23:41.171
you must know your mother
never stopped searching for you.

23:41.255 --> 23:45.050
From the moment you were separated,
you were all she thought of.

23:46.385 --> 23:49.972
It's unfortunate she must go
on a journey now just as you've arrived.

23:50.055 --> 23:52.015
-I wish it were different.
-Journey?

23:52.099 --> 23:53.100
What journey?

23:53.183 --> 23:56.103
-What is she talking about?
-I didn't get a chance to tell you--

23:56.186 --> 23:58.355
It's a mission of the utmost importance.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.567
Maghra will serve as my emissary

24:01.650 --> 24:04.278
to receive a peace delegation
from Trivantes.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.280
You're leaving now?

24:06.363 --> 24:09.867
It's only for a few days. I have to.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.326
-I'm coming with you.
-Me too.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.203
-No.
-No.

24:14.121 --> 24:16.248
You're members of the royal family.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.626
Too valuable a prize
for the Trivantians to pass up.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.588
They wouldn't even know we were there.

24:23.797 --> 24:28.218
You're the future of this kingdom
and quite possibly the world.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.429
We cannot risk any harm coming to you.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.723
My sister is right. You will stay here.

24:32.806 --> 24:35.142
I just got you back.
I will not lose you again.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.562
-Mama.
-Haniwa. Your mother has spoken.

24:38.645 --> 24:42.274
Maghra, the Trivantians will not send
a peace delegation.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.984
They do not negotiate.

24:44.067 --> 24:48.238
I wouldn't call it a negotiation.
They're going to grovel.

24:48.322 --> 24:51.074
The Trivantians have never groveled,
and they never will.

24:51.950 --> 24:54.203
They've never had
a truly worthy adversary.

24:55.037 --> 24:57.164
-You?
-God.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.960
Their soldiers will slit your god's throat
and drink its blood.

25:02.044 --> 25:04.713
Yet it is the Trivantians
who have sued for peace.

25:04.796 --> 25:06.340
It is a trick or a trap.

25:06.423 --> 25:09.468
Baba, we have to try.
If there's even a chance--

25:09.551 --> 25:10.719
There is not.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.638
Then we'll defeat them on the battlefield.

25:12.721 --> 25:15.557
-There is even less chance of that.
-So what would you have us do?

25:15.641 --> 25:19.353
The Trivantians are consumed with
the war with the Ganites to the west.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.230
Do nothing to draw
their attention to the east.

25:21.313 --> 25:23.357
-What if it's too late for that?
-Then surrender.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.025
Spoken like a true Trivantian.

25:44.169 --> 25:46.380
You must understand.

25:46.463 --> 25:49.424
I needed him to keep us safe.

25:49.508 --> 25:51.510
That little worm down there
doesn't think so.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.720
That's just his manner.

25:54.972 --> 25:58.809
Baba. You've always trusted me.

26:01.812 --> 26:03.772
And you have lied to me for all that time.

26:04.273 --> 26:07.734
Well, you of all people know the pain
of a past best forgotten.

26:09.278 --> 26:11.363
You were happy to be reminded, Princess.

26:12.823 --> 26:15.367
The princess who ran away from Paya died

26:15.450 --> 26:18.537
the day I pledged myself
to you as your wife.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.163
Then let us leave this place.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.834
Let us take our children
and return to the mountains.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.503
We were happy there. We can be again.

26:26.587 --> 26:29.548
-If only it were that simple.
-It is that simple.

26:29.631 --> 26:33.260
You are my wife, they are our children,
and this is the past you wish to forget.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.345
Well, these are my father's people.

26:38.140 --> 26:43.854
He begged me on his deathbed
to protect them from my sister,

26:43.937 --> 26:45.397
and I failed him.

26:47.024 --> 26:51.320
I abandoned Paya,
and so many died at Sibeth's hands.

26:55.616 --> 26:59.953
I'm the only one who can
truly challenge her for the throne

27:00.037 --> 27:01.705
and save the kingdom.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.293
So princess isn't good enough.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.338
Now you wish to be queen?

27:09.421 --> 27:12.299
Only until I've ensured a lasting peace,

27:12.382 --> 27:14.760
and then I'll hand power over to Harlan.

27:14.843 --> 27:18.305
Maghra, Harlan is making you his tool.

27:18.889 --> 27:22.518
No. I have made him mine.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.897
You are forgetting
what is most important to you.

27:26.980 --> 27:30.359
You, me, Haniwa, Kofun,
we are what matter most.

27:30.442 --> 27:32.152
I would die for my children.

27:32.236 --> 27:35.405
I'm not asking you to die for them.
I'm asking you to live for them.

27:35.489 --> 27:36.490
If I run off--

27:37.282 --> 27:40.035
If I run off,
if I turn my sister against me again,

27:40.118 --> 27:43.914
Haniwa and Kofun won't
be safe anywhere ever.

27:45.499 --> 27:49.628
I have kept us safe for 18 years.
I can protect us out there.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.297
-I cannot do that here.
-I know, but I can.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.843
I can protect them and you.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.720
Oh, good. Good, you're both here.

27:58.804 --> 28:02.307
Now, let's talk
about sleeping arrangements.

28:02.933 --> 28:05.811
Now, obviously,
in the usual circumstances,

28:05.894 --> 28:07.980
I am open to group activities.

28:08.063 --> 28:10.315
-Harlan.
-Why do you think my bed is so big?

28:10.399 --> 28:11.692
Stop it.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.820
Forgive me.

28:14.903 --> 28:19.616
Just trying to make the best
of a delicate situation.

28:21.910 --> 28:25.372
You even tell him this is my house?
This is my house.

28:27.124 --> 28:28.208
No one cares.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.335
You're drunk.

28:31.420 --> 28:32.546
Yes.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.841
And with good reason, I think.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.094
Look, Baba-- Bab-- Voss,

28:39.178 --> 28:42.890
I don't care what you do in here
with my wife-- Our wife.

28:43.432 --> 28:44.892
Doesn't matter.

28:44.975 --> 28:50.480
But it will be bad for all of us
if people were to find out.

28:51.690 --> 28:55.027
Secret alliances only work
if they stay secret.

28:55.110 --> 28:58.030
If he keeps talking,
I'm going to feed him his own throat.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.990
Is he like this with everybody?

29:00.073 --> 29:02.242
Leave us, please.

29:05.412 --> 29:06.413
As you wish.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.584
You know, in time, Baba Voss,

29:10.667 --> 29:13.170
you will come to realize
I'm not your enemy,

29:13.962 --> 29:16.757
but that makes me no less dangerous.

29:19.176 --> 29:22.513
I may have lost my house,
but this is still my city.

29:22.596 --> 29:25.641
And you would be well advised
to watch how you speak to me.

29:40.697 --> 29:44.326
I need you. Now more than ever.

29:52.668 --> 29:53.669
Baba?

29:57.714 --> 29:59.299
What did they do to you?

30:01.260 --> 30:02.761
I had to get her back.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.860
I honestly don't know
what the queen's thinking.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.237
Witches in the royal family?

30:20.320 --> 30:23.824
Does she think the people will stand for
it? There will be rioting at her gates--

30:23.907 --> 30:26.493
Lower your voice,
or the queen will have your tongue.

30:34.710 --> 30:35.711
Presage.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.046
Is that you?

30:42.676 --> 30:44.469
I am called Paris.

30:46.013 --> 30:47.181
Paris.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.310
I have an urgent message for the princess.

31:01.528 --> 31:04.198
You're the soldier
who brought Kofun to Pennsa.

31:05.282 --> 31:06.283
Yes.

31:07.284 --> 31:09.703
He told me the others were less inclined.

31:11.872 --> 31:13.957
We had our orders. I followed them.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.920
And now, whose orders do you follow?

31:18.754 --> 31:22.841
For 20 years, I have sworn my allegiance
to the Witchfinder general.

31:24.176 --> 31:25.802
Not an easy habit to break.

31:28.764 --> 31:31.683
I will make sure Mag--
The princess gets this.

31:34.728 --> 31:36.855
That day, in the woods.

31:38.524 --> 31:39.900
You touched me.

31:42.319 --> 31:44.780
I wonder what it must feel like

31:44.863 --> 31:48.033
to know things that will happen
before they occur.

31:51.370 --> 31:55.958
Mainly it means I'm always concerned.

32:01.046 --> 32:02.589
Never thought of it like that.

32:03.715 --> 32:05.801
Speaking of those concerns…

32:10.931 --> 32:15.060
You protected Kofun before.
Do the same now.

32:16.144 --> 32:20.232
Stay close to him
and keep him away from trouble.

32:22.401 --> 32:26.864
I pulled him into this world.
He is past listening to me.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.412
I will do as you ask.

32:34.538 --> 32:37.332
Good. Good. Thank you.

32:37.416 --> 32:38.417
But…

32:40.043 --> 32:42.796
only because it is you doing the asking.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.388
You are called Toad?

32:51.471 --> 32:52.764
Yes.

32:52.848 --> 32:54.641
That is a stupid name.

32:55.601 --> 32:58.228
A failure of imagination
on the part of my parents.

33:02.649 --> 33:03.650
Wait here.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.778
Princess Maghra.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.909
I hear a dead man speaking.

33:58.664 --> 34:00.374
Then listen closer.

34:03.752 --> 34:05.045
Is it really you?

34:08.924 --> 34:10.050
Tamacti.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.972
I hear congratulations are in order.
There was a wedding?

34:16.931 --> 34:20.601
Yes. While you were dead,
I've been trying to fix things.

34:20.686 --> 34:22.145
By marrying a lord?

34:22.228 --> 34:27.525
The Pennsan soldiers are loyal
to Harlan first and the queen second.

34:29.277 --> 34:30.279
That's good.

34:31.446 --> 34:34.783
We'll need all the forces we can get
if we're going to overcome your sister.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.786
We're all in agreement.
Harlan is a valuable asset.

34:37.870 --> 34:40.080
-When do we move?
-I'm working as fast as I can.

34:40.163 --> 34:41.998
Explaining why I'm not dead
when I killed myself

34:42.081 --> 34:43.958
in the service of the queen
is proving complicated.

34:44.042 --> 34:46.043
-How much time?
-More than we have.

34:46.128 --> 34:50.507
From what I hear, your sister is days away
from marching Paya into war.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.301
Perhaps not.

34:52.384 --> 34:55.762
I convinced her to let me arrange
a diplomatic summit with Trivantes.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.598
Why would the Trivantians discuss peace

34:57.681 --> 34:59.516
when they never declared war
in the first place?

34:59.600 --> 35:00.726
It's a delay.

35:00.809 --> 35:03.270
To allow the soldiers
to march from the western front.

35:03.353 --> 35:07.691
You said yourself the Trivantians
are heavily occupied on the western front.

35:07.774 --> 35:10.319
Well, they can't possibly
want war in the east.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.908
There may very well be a chance for peace
even if they do have ulterior motives.

35:15.991 --> 35:20.162
As long as your sister is on the throne,
there will be no peace.

35:22.414 --> 35:28.462
However, killing the queen,
or even deposing her, is no simple matter.

35:29.421 --> 35:33.800
There are many laws in the strands
all designed to protect the monarch.

35:33.884 --> 35:36.220
-And you know all these laws?
-No. Not all.

35:36.303 --> 35:37.346
I do.

35:38.430 --> 35:41.725
So you gather your Witchfinders,
and you let me worry about the laws.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.060
Do you have a plan?

35:44.520 --> 35:45.521
More than one.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.859
So different from how we grew up.

35:50.943 --> 35:54.655
You should see Trivantes.
It makes Pennsa look tiny.

35:54.738 --> 35:56.657
It's an incredible place.

35:58.534 --> 36:02.037
Except for the slaves
and how they kidnapped you.

36:03.497 --> 36:05.207
Not all Trivantians are bad.

36:10.546 --> 36:14.299
I met someone there. Someone like us.

36:16.927 --> 36:19.221
-Really?
-Yes.

36:20.889 --> 36:24.434
And no relation to Jerlamarel.
Both of her parents are blind.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.438
So it's not just Jerlamarel's line.

36:30.357 --> 36:31.817
Sight's really coming back.

36:32.526 --> 36:34.027
You don't sound too happy about it.

36:34.111 --> 36:35.988
Look at what it's done to the world.

36:36.780 --> 36:37.948
Look what it's done to us.

36:38.031 --> 36:40.117
It wasn't vision that destroyed the world.

36:41.577 --> 36:42.870
It was people.

36:44.746 --> 36:46.540
They can do that with or without sight.

36:47.165 --> 36:49.376
Look at the queen waging war on Trivantes.

36:49.459 --> 36:53.297
She's protecting her people.
Isn't that what queens do?

36:53.380 --> 36:56.091
Why are you defending someone
who hunted us our whole lives?

36:56.175 --> 36:58.010
She didn't know we were family.

36:59.178 --> 37:01.638
If Mom had spoken up,
maybe we wouldn't have had to hide.

37:01.722 --> 37:03.056
Mom was protecting us.

37:05.434 --> 37:06.435
Maybe.

37:08.437 --> 37:10.105
Maybe she was protecting herself.

37:11.106 --> 37:13.358
I would trust our mother
over the queen any day.

37:14.318 --> 37:15.903
What about Jerlamarel?

37:16.403 --> 37:20.157
You trusted him.
And Boots, you vouched for him too.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.953
Do you really want to taunt me
while I have a blade to your scalp?

37:26.580 --> 37:27.789
Sorry.

37:32.878 --> 37:33.921
I am too.

37:36.798 --> 37:37.925
For everything.

37:43.847 --> 37:46.767
All right. Are you sure about this?

37:47.768 --> 37:48.810
Do it.

38:04.409 --> 38:06.954
-Paris?
-Yeah. Here. Come.

38:08.497 --> 38:09.498
Sit.

38:11.291 --> 38:12.668
Sit with me.

38:15.754 --> 38:19.424
So, a shift in the world.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.677
Yes.

38:27.516 --> 38:28.767
I'm sorry.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.606
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about all of this.

38:36.316 --> 38:37.943
About who I really was.

38:39.319 --> 38:43.907
Maghra, I know who you really are.

38:47.619 --> 38:52.291
As for this,
I am glad you did not tell me.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.752
I would not have kept
your secret from Baba.

38:56.628 --> 38:58.255
He's so angry.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.425
And how would you have him be?

39:02.426 --> 39:06.180
Finding his wife married to another?

39:07.306 --> 39:08.849
I've explained that.

39:10.559 --> 39:15.480
Did you explain to him why you concealed

39:15.564 --> 39:18.025
that you were a daughter of Kane?

39:20.194 --> 39:22.029
He doesn't wanna listen to me.

39:23.572 --> 39:28.035
I can't run away from this.
I have to stay.

39:29.161 --> 39:30.913
For Haniwa and Kofun.

39:32.664 --> 39:35.167
You stay for Haniwa and Kofun?

39:35.667 --> 39:37.002
Who else?

39:40.923 --> 39:42.799
The crown is your birthright.

39:45.719 --> 39:47.971
It is no small thing to wear it.

39:57.064 --> 39:58.065
You know…

40:01.735 --> 40:04.238
it was you who started this whole journey.

40:06.782 --> 40:10.661
You who taught Haniwa and Kofun to read.

40:12.496 --> 40:16.166
Told them the tales
of the great Jerlamarel.

40:18.919 --> 40:20.087
Their father.

40:23.757 --> 40:25.843
I would never have left the mountains.

40:31.765 --> 40:33.851
It was only a matter of time.

40:35.352 --> 40:38.188
The mountains could never contain you.

40:45.571 --> 40:46.989
I've missed you.

41:19.479 --> 41:20.606
Kofun.

41:21.398 --> 41:22.649
What are you doing out here?

41:24.568 --> 41:25.903
Listening to the world.

41:27.446 --> 41:28.739
What do you hear?

41:30.949 --> 41:32.784
Everything. Come.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.081
Close those eyes of yours.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.377
Let the sound fill your mind.

41:47.341 --> 41:50.260
Now, what do you hear?

41:53.639 --> 41:55.015
Nothing really.

41:55.516 --> 41:57.267
Nothing is never nothing.

41:57.893 --> 41:59.895
Even the absence of sound is telling.

42:06.026 --> 42:07.027
Dad.

42:08.487 --> 42:10.948
I know. I heard him come.

42:11.949 --> 42:13.325
Just relax.

42:15.035 --> 42:17.287
He's breathing slow. He's not on the hunt.

42:20.707 --> 42:24.628
There. He's gone to rejoin the others.

42:31.718 --> 42:33.095
Are you angry at Mom?

42:39.434 --> 42:42.020
What your mother does,
she is doing for you and your sister.

42:45.274 --> 42:46.692
And what about for you?

42:53.782 --> 42:56.368
I was sure you'd throw Harlan
off the roof when you arrived.

42:58.662 --> 42:59.913
I considered it.

43:04.710 --> 43:06.295
You can't let Harlan win.

43:09.339 --> 43:10.674
Harlan doesn't matter.

43:12.134 --> 43:13.760
This whole place doesn't matter.

43:15.012 --> 43:16.388
We are together again.

43:19.057 --> 43:21.518
I just have to figure out
how to get out of this place.

43:22.603 --> 43:24.021
Back to where we belong.

43:26.940 --> 43:29.401
I can't think of any place
where we all belong anymore.

43:46.293 --> 43:47.586
Wait, I hear it.

43:49.588 --> 43:50.589
Tell me.

44:03.101 --> 44:04.102
Yeah?

44:04.186 --> 44:06.813
Lord Harlan, your brother's horse
was found running in the orchards.

44:06.897 --> 44:08.649
Saddled and riderless.

44:09.983 --> 44:11.777
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

44:12.611 --> 44:16.406
Kerrigan has a habit of grabbing
the nearest horse when he's in a rush.

44:17.741 --> 44:20.953
Look, put her in my stables.
He'll pick her up when he's home.

44:21.453 --> 44:26.500
Sir, this satchel hung on the saddle
with a message for you.

44:51.608 --> 44:52.860
Oh, no.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.321
No.

45:33.901 --> 45:34.943
What happened?

45:46.121 --> 45:48.248
What is it? What happened?

45:50.250 --> 45:51.502
Kerri.

45:53.003 --> 45:54.254
Kerrigan.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.299
I'm so sorry.

46:14.983 --> 46:15.984
Kofun?

46:18.195 --> 46:19.446
How are you settling in?

46:20.656 --> 46:21.907
Very well, thank you.

46:29.998 --> 46:31.208
Would you like some?

46:34.378 --> 46:35.379
Sure.

46:53.313 --> 46:56.984
Your mother. This house.

46:58.235 --> 47:00.028
It must be a lot to take in.

47:03.323 --> 47:04.324
It is.

47:20.632 --> 47:22.050
Something troubling you?

47:24.511 --> 47:26.388
I forgot for a moment you were sighted.

47:29.141 --> 47:32.561
I imagine you're able to see my pain?

47:34.062 --> 47:35.063
Yes.

47:36.857 --> 47:38.567
What a gift that must be.

47:43.322 --> 47:45.532
It also means I have no choice
but to trust you.

47:47.826 --> 47:49.453
Because it's a secret.

47:50.537 --> 47:51.538
Kofun.

47:53.332 --> 47:54.750
It must stay between us.

47:55.667 --> 47:57.878
Of course. It will.

48:09.806 --> 48:11.350
I lost the baby.

48:18.565 --> 48:20.150
He was taken from me.

48:22.528 --> 48:23.862
I'm so sorry.

48:32.913 --> 48:34.414
When the people find out--

48:34.498 --> 48:38.293
In our village, it happened all the time.
People will understand.

48:40.087 --> 48:41.588
This is not your village.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.800
And I'm not an Alkenny mother.

48:44.883 --> 48:47.845
I stood before the entire city
and announced my child.

48:47.928 --> 48:50.472
A sighted child who now will not come.

48:52.850 --> 48:56.270
They'll think I'm-- I'm no longer chosen.

48:57.604 --> 48:59.439
That I'm no longer God's queen.

49:00.732 --> 49:01.900
So tell them the truth.

49:03.986 --> 49:08.115
They will understand.
They will feel for you, just like I do.

49:08.198 --> 49:09.658
I'm sorry.

49:09.741 --> 49:10.826
Thank you.

49:13.662 --> 49:14.997
Thank you, Kofun.

49:19.376 --> 49:23.839
I'll confess. I came here because
I needed to open my heart to someone.

49:26.300 --> 49:29.428
I felt strongly that I could trust you.

49:30.762 --> 49:32.347
I felt that from the moment we met.

49:33.432 --> 49:35.517
Do you feel you can trust me?

49:41.148 --> 49:42.149
I don't know.

49:45.444 --> 49:48.197
Because my Witchfinders
killed your people?

49:48.280 --> 49:49.281
Yes.

49:53.702 --> 49:56.205
I hope I can help you understand

49:56.288 --> 50:00.918
that if I'd known it was
Maghra and her children,

50:01.543 --> 50:02.544
I--

50:03.962 --> 50:06.465
-I don't want you to hate me, Kofun.
-I don't know you.

50:06.548 --> 50:09.301
But I want you to! I want you to know me.

50:10.594 --> 50:12.596
Being queen is very lonely.

50:16.016 --> 50:19.895
I've been alone for so long,
I feared I lost the ability to connect.

50:21.522 --> 50:23.690
But I already feel connected to you.

50:24.274 --> 50:28.362
There's something about you
that soothes me.

50:29.154 --> 50:30.906
That fills me with hope.

50:33.325 --> 50:34.326
Hope for what?

50:35.118 --> 50:36.620
The future of Paya.

50:37.454 --> 50:39.122
I'll not live forever.

50:39.206 --> 50:44.545
This holy kingdom may someday rest
on your shoulders.

50:45.170 --> 50:48.131
It is too much weight
for any mortal woman or man.

50:48.674 --> 50:53.762
I have only borne it because
through all my years on the throne,

50:53.846 --> 50:58.767
there's always been somebody at my side,
inside of me…

51:01.353 --> 51:03.605
guiding my every move.

51:04.439 --> 51:07.234
-Are you talking about God?
-Yes, Kofun.

51:07.901 --> 51:09.736
Without whom, we are dust.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.449
I will show you

51:14.533 --> 51:17.035
-how to seek God's counsel…
-Sibeth.

51:17.119 --> 51:19.246
…so that you will know her voice
when you need it,

51:19.329 --> 51:21.081
and she will know yours.

51:23.625 --> 51:27.838
Listen.
To hear her, you must first feel her.

51:34.845 --> 51:38.015
Let her flame warm you,
as the God Flame warms the earth.

51:38.098 --> 51:39.600
Oh, yes. Feel her.

51:43.896 --> 51:44.897
Yes.

51:46.356 --> 51:47.816
Feel me, Kofun.

51:49.735 --> 51:53.822
Lose yourself in me,
and you will find God.

51:54.907 --> 51:57.326
Yes. Feel me.

51:58.285 --> 51:59.494
Feel me.
