01:38.040 --> 01:39.040
Hey!

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
You

01:55.960 --> 01:57.029
little

01:59.200 --> 02:00.235
pussy.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.834
Hello, Henry.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.389
Oh...

05:30.320 --> 05:33.153
You can't speak,
but that's normal.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.234
Well, it isn't normal,
but it's only temporary, okay?

05:41.920 --> 05:43.638
Do you remember
how you got here?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.429
That's fine.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.114
That's normal, too.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.908
Henry, wait.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.315
Wait.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.795
We'll get there.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.120
Scan.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.153
<i>Sensory processor activated.</i>

06:08.440 --> 06:09.793
Relax, okay?

06:11.960 --> 06:12.995
<i>Scanning.</i>

06:13.440 --> 06:15.635
<i>- Video link confirmed.</i>
- Up.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.316
This next part
might hurt.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.799
Maybe quite a lot.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.631
But it won't last long,
I promise.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.549
Almost there.

06:41.880 --> 06:42.915
Welder.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.308
You can do it.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.272
Wonderful, Henry.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.589
Squeeze.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.840
Harder.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.715
Cool, right?

07:20.720 --> 07:21.789
Integument?

07:35.720 --> 07:37.199
Please don't move
your hand.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.872
You probably don't recall.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.869
But you were never
a big fan of my work.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.197
Maybe this will
change your mind.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
Right?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.232
Memory's a funny thing.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.678
I'm an expert and I don't know
if you'll ever get yours back.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.709
You don't remember me at all,
do you, Henry?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.073
My name is Estelle.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.593
You and I were...

08:21.800 --> 08:23.153
We still are...

08:27.600 --> 08:28.919
Husband and wife.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.439
I love you, Henry.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.997
I can't wait to
hear you say it.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
Henry.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.954
His memories are still
catching up with him.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.388
Oh, Jesus.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.635
I'm Robbie.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.708
The sorcerer of sound.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.950
You are gonna love this.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.674
Because, sir,

09:18.280 --> 09:22.068
you're gonna get to pick
your own voice.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.080
<i>Thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

09:26.080 --> 09:27.957
<i>Hello, Henry.</i>

09:28.040 --> 09:29.456
Robbie.
Oh, come on, they're options.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.948
What white guy wouldn't wanna
sound like Louis Armstrong?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.314
Just one more. Quick.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.433
Henry, I am your father.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.919
Robert, enough.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.278
Sorry, Mom.
How about we use Henry's voice?

09:40.360 --> 09:41.952
Yeah, whatever you say.
You're the boss.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.268
Boring.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.271
<i>Security breach.</i>
Oh, fuck.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.794
<i>Level 4.</i>
Is this a drill?

09:47.880 --> 09:50.235
What is this?
<i>Security breach, level 4.</i>

09:50.360 --> 09:51.998
Lock the door.
It's probably a mistake.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.470
Estelle, call the base.
<i>Security breach, level 4.</i>

10:14.920 --> 10:16.069
Oh, no.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.394
Yes.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.548
Get up.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.634
Henry, right?

10:34.080 --> 10:35.798
Please. Don't.
Shut up.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.070
How do you like
the new you?

10:41.880 --> 10:45.793
Did I interrupt the procedure?
Can Henry not talk yet?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.799
No, he can't. No.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.791
Don't look at me
like that, Henry.

10:51.160 --> 10:55.119
Your girlfriend here
might have rebuilt you,

10:55.400 --> 10:58.631
but I gave her the raw
materials to work with.

10:58.760 --> 11:03.197
And I mean really, really raw materials.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.672
What's your name?
Timothy.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.352
Nice to meet you,
Timothy.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.314
Did you see Henry when Estelle
brought his remains here?

11:11.440 --> 11:12.475
Yeah.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.676
Would you please be so kind
to describe them

11:14.760 --> 11:19.754
to better Henry's understanding
of how good he looks now?

11:19.840 --> 11:23.469
Sure. His arm was
shot off below the...

11:24.440 --> 11:28.353
Below the elbow and the...
The leg shot off below the knee.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.776
And there was
a football-sized dent...

11:29.800 --> 11:31.358
Did you happen to see
his head?

11:32.840 --> 11:33.955
Yes.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.599
Do tell.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.429
Um, the skull was dented in
and there was this...

11:40.720 --> 11:42.073
His eyes were missing

11:42.160 --> 11:46.711
and, um, the bottom half of
his jaw was shred to pieces.

11:48.680 --> 11:49.954
Just about right.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.952
What?

11:58.920 --> 12:02.117
Shh... I'm bleeding, too.
That was a little strenuous.

12:04.320 --> 12:05.799
Stay close.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.154
Henry!

12:18.840 --> 12:19.875
Close it.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.669
Henry, come on!

12:26.560 --> 12:28.312
Henry, try to keep up!

12:31.760 --> 12:32.954
Shh.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.040
Come on.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.555
Kick it in.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.875
Come on.

12:41.320 --> 12:42.912
If Akan gets
ahold of my work,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.515
men like these will be brought back
from the dead to form his army.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.157
Go! Go!

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
Henry, no!

12:57.440 --> 12:58.509
Henry!

12:59.280 --> 13:00.349
Take my hand!

13:05.880 --> 13:08.678
<i>Escape pod initiated.</i>

13:08.760 --> 13:09.856
There are two pods.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.552
One.
Marty?

13:11.640 --> 13:14.279
Sorry, the man's clearly
gone insane.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.634
Marty, no!

13:18.760 --> 13:19.795
Henry.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.550
- It's yours. Get in.
- Estelle!

13:23.640 --> 13:24.914
Get in! Get in!

13:25.600 --> 13:28.068
<i>Escape pod initiated.</i>

13:58.640 --> 13:59.834
<i>Altitude...</i>

14:00.440 --> 14:02.954
The chute! The chute!
Pull the chute!

14:06.440 --> 14:09.193
It's going too fast!
It's going too fast!

14:11.000 --> 14:12.319
Hold on, Henry!

14:40.880 --> 14:41.949
Oh, God.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.789
Akan's mercenaries.
Put me down. Put me down!

14:47.800 --> 14:49.518
Henry.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.872
They underestimate you, okay?
Let them get close and then engage.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.399
Engage!

15:03.960 --> 15:06.872
No! Henry!
Fight back!

15:06.960 --> 15:09.315
Come on! No, stop it!

15:10.920 --> 15:12.035
Henry!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.228
You stop it!

15:20.320 --> 15:21.320
You stop it!
What?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.959
You stop it!
Estelle...

15:29.160 --> 15:30.912
No!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.274
Henry!

18:19.560 --> 18:22.358
You're a fucking rabbit in
the headlights, aren't you?

18:24.200 --> 18:26.395
It's all right.
I'm not here to hurt you.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.036
Is your speech module
installed?

18:31.200 --> 18:32.235
Shit.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.235
Well, at least we know
you're not deaf.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.430
It's all right.
You can put your hands down now.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.336
Three years I've been
waiting for this moment

18:41.360 --> 18:43.510
and I get Charlie
fucking Chaplin.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.073
Fuck's sake, come on!

18:48.120 --> 18:50.111
All right, let's have
a look at you.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.517
Open the glove box, please.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.396
Take out that
whole contraption.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.989
You gotta untangle the wires.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.599
Is that a wedding ring?

19:01.760 --> 19:03.910
Are you married?

19:05.280 --> 19:07.077
How's that working out
for you?

19:08.680 --> 19:10.511
Yeah, what a shocker.

19:10.600 --> 19:14.513
Right. Next, I need you to
take your shirt off, please.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.274
Open up there.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.628
Yeah, those.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.194
Plug the jacks in there.
Yeah, in there.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.913
So, your name's Henry and...

19:25.320 --> 19:29.074
Okay, well, the good news is
that you're gonna live a while.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.718
The bad news

19:30.800 --> 19:36.636
is that in this case, a while means 20,
30 minutes tops, Henry.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.517
Unless you're very,
very lucky.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.954
Which you are.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.956
Uncle Jimmy is gonna take
you to his lab. Hang on.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.028
Oh, shit. We got
bacon on our tail.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.312
Unplug yourself.
Put that away.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.436
There's some clothes in there.
Put the hoodie on.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.837
There's not enough time. Fuck it.
Just cover the blood up with your bag.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.790
Just stay calm and let me
handle this, yeah?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.480
That's how it goes...

20:20.120 --> 20:21.120
Bollocks.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.436
Fucking Akan, paying off the...

23:12.800 --> 23:15.936
I'm gonna have to hurt you,
Henry, but it's for your own good, mate.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.598
Just give me your arm...
Hey!

23:17.680 --> 23:18.715
Shit!

23:19.080 --> 23:21.389
It's me! It's Jimmy.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.472
We've only got a few moments until
they run into us again, mate. Just...

23:24.560 --> 23:28.269
Okay, just give me your arm.
Okay, just relax.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.229
Here it is.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.068
Here it is.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.989
Come on. Hey, bingo!

23:38.880 --> 23:42.190
This little fucker is how
they've been tracking you.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.240
Toodle-oo.

23:45.160 --> 23:49.551
In a few moments, your mechanical
parts are gonna start shutting down.

23:50.240 --> 23:55.030
Your friend Akan's got an important
Russian connection named Slick Dimitry.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.116
Slick handles all Akan's

23:57.200 --> 24:01.398
cops/guns/real estate/
a lot of other shit.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.870
This helpful dot on the map

24:08.200 --> 24:09.394
is Slick's place.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.314
All you gotta do
is break in there,

24:13.240 --> 24:14.309
kill him,

24:15.640 --> 24:17.392
open up his rib cage,

24:17.960 --> 24:20.428
take out his beating heart,

24:22.080 --> 24:23.513
and fucking eat it.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.829
I'm kidding!

24:27.080 --> 24:29.160
I'm kidding. You don't have
to fucking eat his heart.

24:29.520 --> 24:33.672
Under his heart is his
charge pump, yeah?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.559
Bring that to me.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.754
Use this and I'll
contact you on this.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.670
That has gotta be the gayest
jacket I've ever seen.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.152
I'll be in touch!

29:44.200 --> 29:45.428
Henry.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.953
<i>Akan's already started.</i>

29:47.040 --> 29:49.759
<i>If we don't stop him, he'll have
his army in days or sooner.</i>

30:56.240 --> 30:58.037
You're half machine,
half pussy.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.109
Wait, wait.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.151
I can tell you something
very important.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.151
About the man
who sent you here.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.597
<i>Oi, Henry.
I'm at this high-class establishment.</i>

34:25.679 --> 34:28.319
<i>Follow the dot and then just
knock on the knocker.</i>

34:28.400 --> 34:29.992
<i>Get it?
Knock on the knocker!</i>

35:24.200 --> 35:28.796
Hi. I'm a fucking car, baby.
Lexus convertible!

35:44.960 --> 35:46.598
Oh, that's good.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.477
Yeah, yeah.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.319
Oh! God, that's amazing.
Yeah!

35:54.360 --> 35:55.679
Fuck, you're late!

35:56.040 --> 35:57.439
You're late! Ha!

36:00.480 --> 36:06.919
The last 15 minutes have been a fucking
roller coaster of emotions for me, mate.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.920
I didn't know if I was ever
gonna see you again.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.992
So I fired up
some of this shit.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.759
Fired up my fucking nose.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.032
But there you are.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.316
It's okay.
You just lost power.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.400
Come on. Hey, there!

36:25.480 --> 36:27.596
Bring me some of that
strong Russian shit, ladies.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.352
Okay, now where's
that booster pump?

36:29.600 --> 36:32.398
Where is it? Did you get it?
Did you get the fucking...

36:32.720 --> 36:34.551
Yeah! Fucking hell.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.631
This is it.
This is it, yeah?

36:36.720 --> 36:38.039
Okay, hang on.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.072
Okay, hold this, lady.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.520
Shit.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.032
Okay, I gotta get this
little fucker in there.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.800
Who am I kidding?
I'm in no condition to do this.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.471
I'm sorry. I'm in no
condition to do this, mate.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.710
I'm in no condition.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.633
I'm sorry. I'm in no
condition to do this.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.589
Oh, goodness.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.360
Oh, goodness,
what have you done?

37:41.400 --> 37:43.520
What have you done this time, Jimmy?

37:44.400 --> 37:46.072
Are you still conscious?

37:46.200 --> 37:47.918
Yeah. Hello.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.319
You're gonna be okay.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.551
Just gotta get a little bit
of power into you.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.200
Ladies, could you give us
a bit of space, please?

37:55.280 --> 37:56.315
Thank you.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.353
You're a big deal,
you know?

38:01.120 --> 38:04.271
You're not the only one
wronged by Akan.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.590
You and I both
want the same thing.

38:06.720 --> 38:07.835
This may hurt a bit.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.550
There we go.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.148
That's wonderful.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.791
Now I can take you
back to my lab.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.952
I'm Jimmy, by the way.

38:19.160 --> 38:22.630
I realize this is all
very confusing for you.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.276
But it's better
if I show you

38:25.360 --> 38:26.840
at the lab, yes...

38:27.640 --> 38:28.709
Hello?

38:34.240 --> 38:35.240
They're here.

38:35.520 --> 38:36.560
They must've followed you.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.558
I can't let them see me like this.
I can't let... I'm sorry.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.278
I can't stay here, Henry.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.676
I'm sorry.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.754
Oh, shit.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.909
Ah!

38:52.680 --> 38:54.272
Fuck yeah!

38:54.760 --> 38:56.318
Fucking hell,
Akan's boys are here.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.594
I'm gonna
hold them off, yeah?

38:57.680 --> 38:58.874
I'm gonna hold them off,
yeah?

38:58.960 --> 39:01.758
More guns for you in the
drawer, yeah? Whoo!

39:01.840 --> 39:04.434
This is fucking war,
baby, yeah!

39:04.520 --> 39:05.919
Whoo!

39:06.000 --> 39:07.399
Fuck yeah!

39:07.480 --> 39:08.754
Hi, ladies.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.479
I fucking had that!

40:08.840 --> 40:09.989
Go, go, go!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.672
Run, run!

40:36.280 --> 40:39.352
The floor is fucking lava!
I'm gonna burn this...

40:39.440 --> 40:40.509
Olga! Katya!

40:40.840 --> 40:41.840
Sorry.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.431
Please, please!

40:56.520 --> 40:58.033
Please don't hurt me.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.232
I've got a family.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.548
Is that your wife?

41:01.640 --> 41:03.551
Uh... Uh...

41:09.440 --> 41:12.876
Don't mind her, Henry.
She's mourning her late husband.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.755
I wasn't betting on
seeing you again.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.634
Your persistence
is unparalleled.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.239
Quite exciting.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.552
Slick Dimitry's services
were excellent.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.031
I'm just glad
I never paid up front.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.991
I'll tell Estelle
you did well.

41:34.640 --> 41:35.709
Akan!

41:35.800 --> 41:38.155
Akan, you open this fucking
door, you hear me?

41:38.240 --> 41:40.993
I got her all dolled up in the
back of my truck downstairs.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.196
I'm gonna rip your
fucking lungs out!

41:48.600 --> 41:51.751
You'll go far, Henry,
unlike this piece of shit.

42:21.840 --> 42:25.719
Hey, Henry. Put your gun down.
It's all good.

42:28.160 --> 42:31.152
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
People, people.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.879
Chill out. Calm down.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.311
Now I've shared
something with you,

42:37.120 --> 42:40.715
I need you to share
something with me.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.270
Where's Akan going?
Mmm.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.314
Oh, shit, shit.

42:58.240 --> 43:04.076
Now that is my ego talking to yours.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.160
What do you want?

43:11.240 --> 43:13.913
Higher self, ego?

43:15.000 --> 43:17.992
Higher self, ego?

43:18.280 --> 43:19.429
Higher self!

43:19.520 --> 43:22.432
Higher self. Yeah. Okay.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.353
Akan's convoy are taking
the girl to his base.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.868
Ah, shit. Let me handle this.
Let me handle this.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.716
I'm sorry that
you're upset, okay?

43:42.800 --> 43:45.234
Henry and I... Henry and I
are gonna go deal with Akan.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.336
You wanna go on the bike?
You can go on the bike.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.759
Just... Yeah, you wanna go?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.639
Okay, go on your bike.
Yeah, yeah, go on your bike. Fucking hell.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.075
Sometimes it's easier just to say yes.

44:50.240 --> 44:51.673
Henry, catch!

46:26.520 --> 46:28.670
God, I thought I'd
lost you forever, Henry.

46:28.760 --> 46:32.036
I was so scared.
I was so scared when you fell.

46:32.760 --> 46:34.352
I thought I would
never see you again.

46:38.560 --> 46:39.913
I love you, Henry.

46:41.360 --> 46:42.554
I love you.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.709
<i>How sweet.</i>

46:47.760 --> 46:50.513
<i>If I took this moment
and put it in a cup of tea,</i>

46:50.600 --> 46:52.192
<i>I wouldn't need sugar.</i>

47:22.920 --> 47:27.232
Each year,
100,000 baseball bats are sold in Russia,

47:27.320 --> 47:29.595
and, at most, 50 baseballs.

47:30.080 --> 47:33.595
Gives you an idea of
a great Russian pastime.

47:34.280 --> 47:38.034
This is a rare
surviving bat.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.440
Estelle.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.756
Would you please be
so kind and stand up?

47:47.600 --> 47:48.669
No.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.435
Or do you want to
take her place?

47:52.960 --> 47:56.555
Estelle, your boy's
quite the white knight,

47:56.640 --> 47:58.949
sacrificing himself
to keep you alive

47:59.280 --> 48:00.952
only for my dick

48:03.520 --> 48:05.590
to kill you later.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.593
Are you sure, Henry?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.198
Are you sure?

48:14.440 --> 48:15.634
Brilliant!

48:15.800 --> 48:16.949
Uh...

48:17.080 --> 48:19.116
Come over here, Henry.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.316
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, Henry.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.508
<i>You</i>

48:48.680 --> 48:49.999
<i>little</i>

48:50.960 --> 48:51.995
<i>pussy.</i>

49:17.440 --> 49:19.874
Give peace
a chance, brothers.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.788
My ego wants to kill you but my
higher self doesn't.

49:23.880 --> 49:25.108
Jesus, baby.

49:25.200 --> 49:26.758
I was talking to that man.

49:28.200 --> 49:29.394
Shit.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.552
Look at this.
Dude's got a memory blocker.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.117
<i>Well, that's about
all I can do for you, mate.</i>

49:52.240 --> 49:53.434
Time for a reboot.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.677
See you in about
15 minutes, hopefully.

50:15.440 --> 50:16.475
Hey.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.920
He's awake.

50:18.640 --> 50:20.915
Your eyes might be
a bit blurry.

50:21.600 --> 50:25.593
It's just your depth perception
trying to calibrate, yeah?

50:26.880 --> 50:28.632
Follow me as I walk, yeah?

50:29.880 --> 50:30.915
Get up.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.275
Okay.

50:33.800 --> 50:34.800
All right.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.080
Now...

50:37.680 --> 50:39.716
Can you focus on me
over here?

50:39.800 --> 50:40.994
Yeah?
Yeah.

50:42.120 --> 50:45.430
Burying you,
it's like burying treasure.

50:46.280 --> 50:50.751
I really don't understand what
Akan is thinking because...

52:48.120 --> 52:49.553
Ah!

53:17.360 --> 53:21.353
<i>Henry, stop dicking around.
You're almost there, mate.</i>

53:21.440 --> 53:23.476
<i>Here's where you
gotta get to. Chop-chop.</i>

54:11.280 --> 54:12.280
Shh.

54:12.360 --> 54:15.238
It's me, Jimmy. Move.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.040
Ah, shit.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.753
Those pigs are here again.

54:33.600 --> 54:34.749
Psst.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.113
Don't compromise my lab.

54:41.640 --> 54:42.709
Let them leave.

54:48.080 --> 54:51.356
Henry, no.
I'm instructing... Shit.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.439
Good job, Charlie Bronson.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.919
Bravo 2-0.

56:01.120 --> 56:02.314
Lights up.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.308
Play video.

56:09.160 --> 56:12.118
<i>Dawn of twilight.
A cyborg era.</i>

56:12.840 --> 56:13.989
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

56:14.080 --> 56:16.719
<i>I've lobotomized everything
not essential...</i>

56:18.640 --> 56:20.551
<i>Not essential to soldiers.</i>

56:20.640 --> 56:23.712
<i>Personal memories, speech, sense of taste.
It's all gone.</i>

56:23.800 --> 56:27.349
<i>Might still have a bit of an
issue with emotional motivation,</i>

56:27.480 --> 56:28.959
<i>which...
Motivation?</i>

56:29.280 --> 56:31.919
<i>Try your fucking
paycheck, James.</i>

56:32.760 --> 56:33.988
<i>My...</i>

56:34.320 --> 56:35.673
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

56:48.000 --> 56:49.280
<i>What the shit-fuck,
James?</i>

56:49.360 --> 56:51.032
<i>I'm sorry, sir!
I'm so sorry!</i>

56:51.120 --> 56:55.033
<i>Oh, shit! Open the doors!
Please! Open the door!</i>

56:55.120 --> 56:57.076
<i>We've got a malfunction!
Let me out, please!</i>

56:57.160 --> 56:58.416
<i>Sir, I'll fix it.</i>

56:58.440 --> 56:59.509
<i>I doubt it.</i>

57:04.520 --> 57:05.953
<i>Fucking idiot.</i>

57:09.080 --> 57:12.516
<i>You know, Jimmy, something
about a spine snapping</i>

57:13.200 --> 57:15.270
<i>never gets old.</i>

57:17.000 --> 57:20.072
<i>It sounds like...</i>
The end, the beginning?

57:20.560 --> 57:22.312
Or are they the same?

57:22.520 --> 57:24.033
Have a seat, Henry.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.319
When a man is first
crippled,

57:26.400 --> 57:29.358
there's always one question
on everyone's mind,

57:29.880 --> 57:31.359
especially his.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.033
Does his dick work?

57:36.320 --> 57:39.995
Mine didn't, so I plotted
my escape from this chair.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.110
I had come to Russia
when the west banned

57:43.200 --> 57:45.668
resuscitation of
cadaver tissue.

57:45.760 --> 57:49.639
Akan's a megalomaniac,
but my research was funded.

57:49.720 --> 57:52.917
I kept my eyes
on the Nobel Prize.

57:53.400 --> 57:57.234
Who has time for icky ethics when
he's rich and his cock works, eh?

57:59.720 --> 58:01.631
I paid a high price.

58:02.920 --> 58:07.072
I stopped making soldiers
and then I succeeded.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.153
I grew men
made of cyberflesh.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.151
Really, they're just
fancy-pants prostheses,

58:12.240 --> 58:15.073
but don't dare tell...
My avatars!

58:15.920 --> 58:20.630
Now, cyborgs, on the other
hand, have bits and a brain.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.837
They think for themselves,
in theory at least.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.751
Shall we have a look at you?

58:27.600 --> 58:29.670
That hippie,
always with the ganja.

58:29.760 --> 58:33.150
You're not baked, are you?
Hope not.

58:33.880 --> 58:34.915
All right.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.949
You are the man, Henry.

58:40.040 --> 58:41.519
Hmm.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.717
There's very little actual
man left, of course.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.714
Enhanced skeletal
muscular systems,

58:48.800 --> 58:52.759
cardiovascular turbo boosted with
a curium-244 atomic battery.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.433
A good night's sleep and you'd
power an aircraft carrier.

58:58.920 --> 59:01.115
Remarkable technology,
is it not?

59:04.080 --> 59:06.719
Not you. My boys.

59:07.400 --> 59:10.039
I made the first few
for revenge but then

59:10.120 --> 59:12.475
I started exploring
new aspects of myself.

59:12.840 --> 59:14.068
Can I have a sip?

59:14.880 --> 59:16.518
Mmm.

59:16.600 --> 59:20.229
I have lived these
past years, Henry.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.435
My lads,

59:21.520 --> 59:24.830
they get speeding tickets,
they walk barefoot through the grass,

59:24.960 --> 59:27.793
and boy, do they get laid.

59:29.320 --> 59:33.154
You'll never guess what we
do here sometimes alone.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.992
Hit play. Over there.

59:36.480 --> 59:37.595
Go on.

59:46.880 --> 59:52.318
<i>I've got you
Under my skin</i>

59:54.160 --> 01:00:00.110
<i>I've got you deep
In the heart of me</i>

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:08.359
<i>So deep in my heart That
you're really A part of me</i>

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:15.271
<i>I've got you
Under my skin</i>

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.878
<i>I'd tried so
Not to give in</i>

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:30.474
<i>I said to myself
"This affair never Will go so well"</i>

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:38.517
<i>But why should I try to resist
when, baby, I know so well</i>

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.272
<i>I've got you under my skin?</i>

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.314
What is all this?

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.549
Close your eyes.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.789
Close your eyes.
Something's wrong with you, mate.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.711
Don't worry, it's not
the clap or nothing.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.395
Just gonna sit you down in this
chair and take a look at you, yeah?

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.237
The scan says
you're in terrible danger.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.278
Of being shivved for being a traitor,
you lying grasser!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.433
I'm shutting you down, mate.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.709
Put down the proto baby.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.791
Now!

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.390
We tried to
unplug you nicely

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.836
even though we knew that you
beamed your video to Akan.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.640
No?

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.269
What's this?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.991
What's that?

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.235
You're broadcasting
that to Akan!

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.320
Enough!

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.315
Enough.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.193
Even if I did believe you,
I still have to...

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.476
Fuck! Henry, no!

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.391
No!

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.432
You brought them to my lab!

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:49.796
I trusted you!
Henry, please kill me.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.915
Akan won't.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.552
He'll make me live in this
straightjacket of rotten, smelly skin!

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.351
What the fuck was I thinking that
Akan's toy robot was my friend?

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.758
Thank you, Henry.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.915
Fuck you, too,
but mostly thanks.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.951
My lab's compromised,
but I can build a new one

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.033
using Akan's equipment
when we go get your wife

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.232
together, right?

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.271
Hey, put that on the wall.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.597
If I can't have my lab,
no one's having her.

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.872
Now, don't lose this.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.198
Fuck you, Akan.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.477
And don't change your channel.
We're coming right over.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.838
All right, I counted
six vehicles.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.751
That's at least 35 men.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.832
We've gotta cut them down to half
that before they enter the hotel

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.150
to give us a fighting chance
to get out alive.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.915
Also,

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.517
there's a certain stigma attached
to blokes who like musicals.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.476
I just wanna get it out there right
now that I'm straight as an arrow.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.080
Got it?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.515
Here they come.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.439
Wait for it.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.556
Wait for it.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.640
Now.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.315
Hey, cover me.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.876
Fuck, they're in the hotel.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.634
We don't need the sniper
anymore either.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.155
Go inside. See the colonel.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.239
Over here, laddie.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.639
Arm yourself to the teeth.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.315
Don't touch that.
Imogene's mine.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.158
That's what my father
used to say.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.515
"A grenade a day
keeps the enemy at bay."

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920
Come along.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.629
Chop-chop.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.628
Big Sally.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.594
Eh...

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.989
Well, home is
where the battle is.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.196
Right, private, it is our duty to ensure
that no harm comes to the cripple,

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.395
understood?

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.435
Follow on.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.154
If you can hear them,
but you can't shoot them,

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.559
you can probably
grenade them.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.238
Drop an egg
down there, laddie.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.760
Forward.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.828
Come along.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.434
Good Lord,
how embarrassing.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.833
Dodged a bullet on that one.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.633
I'll cover you.
You go around them.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.752
Don't let the cripple
get below you, laddie!

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
Jolly good.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.790
Pull your weight!
Help me with the cripple.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.911
Retreat five paces
back on my command, laddie.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.950
<i>Spasibo,</i> Yuri. My quarters
are actually up there.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.158
Would you like to see them?

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.355
Oh, we will.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.589
Indeed.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.113
Don't spare
the horses.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.636
You can take
the next slipway.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.552
Off here. Here we go.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.195
Down on anchors, laddie.
Let's turn the tables on these buggers.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.315
Tally-ho.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.629
Big Ben.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.557
Akan is a cunt.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.035
Oh, my.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.871
Looks like Akan's
already begun.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.716
By tomorrow, these poor chaps will be
super robotic soldiers like yourself.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.275
Look out!

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.829
On your feet, lad.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.318
On your left.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.549
Hang on.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.151
I'm gonna buy you
some time!

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.235
Seal the door.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.913
Can't tell you the number
of times I've dreamt

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.991
that I was riding up
in this lift.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.313
It's a pity I can't...

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.311
It's just the landing gear,
laddie.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.750
Now, listen to me.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.792
When you kill Akan,

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.677
I want you to look him
right in those eyes

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.469
until the rest of him is just as
dead as they are, understood?

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.833
No, I'm afraid I shall
not be coming with.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.995
But you letting me get you this
far has given an old sweat

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.476
his grandest gift
in all his years.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.989
No. It's lodged
in his jugular.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.838
If you uncork it,
I won't be able to...

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.840
The thingamajig
in your pocket, quickly.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.632
Well, I have
a confession to make.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.154
See, I've been surveilling
Akan for years.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.597
So when you dropped down
onto that roadway

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.591
and went rogue
so magnificently,

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:01.435
well, all I saw was
my shot at revenge.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:05.232
You proved me right with Dimitry,
but then in the forest,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.871
<i>well, I noticed an implant.</i>

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:13.678
A memory block, see?

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.188
And I couldn't afford to have you
remember a better life somewhere else.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.799
So I left it in.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.551
Not my finest hour,
I'm afraid.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.993
But then,

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.834
back at my lab while
I was trying to analyze

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.878
what you could do for me,

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.835
I realized

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.555
who you are to me.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.115
Henry.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.797
It's bloody nice
having a friend, Henry.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.029
You'd think

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.918
all those deaths would've
prepared me for this.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.431
If you haven't already,

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.508
you'll start to remember bits
from your past now, Henry.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.958
And those memories,

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.595
they're real.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.754
They're you.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.749
Trust them.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.633
<i>Memories,
memories, memories.</i>

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.948
<i>My first batch of
cyber soldiers.</i>

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.197
<i>With everything that
you have experienced today</i>

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.909
<i>uploaded into what's
left of their brains,</i>

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.111
<i>all they remember is waking up in the lab
with their wife screwing their legs on.</i>

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.028
<i>I love you, Charlie.</i>

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.113
<i>I love you, Edward.</i>

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.033
<i>I love you, Thomas.</i>

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.839
<i>You recognize these?</i>

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.995
<i>No?</i>

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.869
<i>That's odd.</i>

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.119
<i>They're your wife's.</i>

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
<i>Mmm...</i>

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.510
<i>I smell what you
like about her.</i>

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.438
<i>This one is almost
ready for you.</i>

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.999
<i>But I'm warning you,</i>

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.509
<i>their boosters make
the one you have in you now...</i>

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.472
Look like a fucking 9-volt.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.718
Go ahead and fuck him up.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.395
Get up.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.833
Get up!

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.755
Can you handle this?

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.239
Henry.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.436
Why are you hitting
yourself, Henry?

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.634
Hmm?

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.109
<i>Baby?
Baby, are you okay?</i>

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.478
<i>I love how protective
you are of me.</i>

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.439
<i>Mmm...</i>

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.473
You owe me an apology.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:26.835
For?

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.313
Doubting me.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.155
I did have certain
apprehensions.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.559
Then why'd you let me do it?

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.918
I was just entertaining my woman
and losing all of my men.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.918
Is everybody dead?

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.155
Yes.
Yes.

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.240
Do you know when I realized
this was working?

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.320
When?

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.991
When Henry pulled me
into the escape pod,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.673
trying to get me out of
the lab no matter what.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.913
Who would've thought that pussy
is a hell of a motivator?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.069
Ah.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.518
We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow,
a thousand next week.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.510
Each one's first
memory will be

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.913
his wife slipping a cheap
brass ring on his finger.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:19.798
Every single one
of my soldiers

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.829
will wake willing to do anything
my brilliant wife tells him,

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.031
whether it's marching on Paris
or the White House lawn.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.355
I would like to pretend you
understand the part you played.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.713
You didn't make
history, Henry.

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.471
You helped end it.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.553
Mmm...

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.675
<i>You</i>

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.039
<i>little</i>

01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.715
pussy.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.512
That's what my old man
called me.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.678
It's like it was my name.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.234
And I proved him right by
killing all the wrong people.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.158
I love you, Henry,

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.395
and I'll never call you anything but
your name, but you gotta decide.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:25.910
Are you gonna lay there,
swallow that blood in your mouth?

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.192
Or are you gonna stand up,

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.670
spit it out,
and go spill theirs?

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:49.869
Akan!

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.916
You fuck...

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.960
No!

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.275
Stop!

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.077
I am ordering you to stop!

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:50.748
Henry!

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.313
Stop!

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.874
Where is he?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000
No.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.549
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.789
Fuck you!

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.553
How could you do this
to me, Henry?

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.710
How could you
fucking do this?

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.389
Answer me!

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.673
Answer me!

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.792
Motherfucker!

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.911
What happened, Henry?

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.512
You were supposed
to love me.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.440
Henry!

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.555
Henry!

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.952
Listen to your heart!

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.760
<i>Hello, Henry.</i>

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.150
<i>Well, if you're hearing this, there's
one more thing I need you to do.</i>
