00:02.360 --> 00:03.873
You get to a point
with your parents...

00:05.480 --> 00:08.472
...where all you can do with them
is eat. You can't talk anymore...

00:08.640 --> 00:11.837
...but you wanna at least try
and keep your mouths moving.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.309
And they're so anxious for it,
you know. You come in;

00:14.480 --> 00:16.311
"How was the plane?
You must be hungry.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.152
How did you sleep?
Ready for breakfast?"

00:18.360 --> 00:20.954
My mother will argue with me
about what I like.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.157
"Can I have a piece of pumpkin pie?"
"You don't like pumpkin pie."

00:24.320 --> 00:26.550
"Yes, I do."
"Since when?"

00:26.720 --> 00:28.312
"What's the difference?
Can I have it?"

00:28.480 --> 00:31.916
"No. I have never seen you eat
a piece of pumpkin pie."

00:36.160 --> 00:38.196
Mr. Peterman sent me over here
for a physical...

00:38.360 --> 00:40.476
...because as you may
or may not know...

00:40.680 --> 00:43.752
...he and I are going on a trip
to Kenya.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.312
Africa.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.553
It's my first such mission
for the company.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.800
The Masai Bushmen
wear these great sandals...

00:52.960 --> 00:55.428
...and we're gonna knock them off.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.268
Not the Masai, the sandals.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.632
-I'll need a urine sample.
-Right.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.429
Africa? Do you know how hot
it gets there?

01:05.640 --> 01:07.915
Like 150 degrees.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.674
Your skin is gonna be
simmering with boils.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.916
Oh, come on.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.559
You coming to The Tonight Show?

01:14.720 --> 01:16.870
Yeah, yeah. My parents wanna
come too, is that okay?

01:17.080 --> 01:19.435
-Sure. My parents will be there.
-The Tonight Show?

01:19.600 --> 01:21.113
Yeah, they're in town.
You wanna go?

01:21.320 --> 01:23.151
-Are you doing new material?
-No.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.594
I don't think so.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.953
Hey, the super's in my bathroom
changing my showerhead.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.628
-Have they changed yours?
-No, he's doing mine next.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.076
-They're low-flow, you know.
-Low-flow?

01:36.240 --> 01:38.595
Well, I don't like the sound of that.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.470
So, what are your parents
doing here in New York?

01:42.680 --> 01:43.954
Well, they were humiliated.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.634
After the impeachment,
my father left office in disgrace.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.914
-So, what are their plans?
-Well, this is the problem.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.958
They're moving into this new
development. Here's the pamphlet.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.720
"Del Boca Vista." But they're
not quite ready to go back...

01:55.880 --> 01:58.713
...so they're in seclusion here
for a while at Uncle Leo's.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.512
The three of them
in that tiny apartment?

02:00.720 --> 02:03.280
No, Leo's not there.
He's got a girlfriend, Lydia.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.228
-ln fact, he moved in with her.
-Uncle Leo's having regular sex?

02:07.440 --> 02:09.954
Yeah, I know, it devalues
the whole thing.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.512
-Hello.
-What time do we have to be...

02:15.680 --> 02:17.159
...at The Tonight Show on Thursday?

02:17.520 --> 02:21.195
-You gotta be there at 4;30.
-But it comes on at 11;30.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.676
Yeah, well, they tape it in the
afternoon and then they air it at 11;30.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.031
-How long they been doing this?
-Thirty years.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.277
Helen, did you know that they
tape this thing in the afternoon?

02:31.480 --> 02:33.471
All right. I'll see you later.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.875
Georgie, how come your parents
never moved to Florida?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.192
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?

02:40.400 --> 02:42.391
-Yeah, it is.
-I mean, they're retired.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.516
There's no economic reason
for them to be here.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.399
They have no friends.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.278
No social reason for them
to be here.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.711
-You're all grown-up.
-Yeah, they're through ruining my life.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.996
What the hell
are they still doing here?

02:54.200 --> 02:56.111
Let me see this pamphlet.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.318
All right, I'll....

03:00.480 --> 03:02.277
I'll get back to you.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.238
-Hello?
-Where can I buy some ice?

03:08.400 --> 03:10.072
Your father likes a lot of ice.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.235
I don't know.
Maybe get an ice tray?

03:13.440 --> 03:16.000
-I can do that.
-You know, Dad just called me.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.276
Yeah, I know.
His phlebitis is acting up.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.596
Yeah. All right.
Well, I got some people here.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.233
-Okay.
-All right, bye.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.674
-You see this?
-What?

03:23.840 --> 03:25.876
Any thought pops into their head,
they call me...

03:26.040 --> 03:27.951
...because it's a local call now.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.118
I'm used to a 1200-mile buffer zone.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.397
I can't handle this. Plus, I got
the dinners, I got the pop-ins.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.075
-They pop in. It's brutal.
-Any idea when they're going back?

03:38.240 --> 03:40.754
The only way out is if
Leo breaks up with his girlfriend...

03:40.920 --> 03:43.832
...and moves back in. Then they
would have to go back to Florida.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.269
How's that gonna happen?

03:46.600 --> 03:49.672
It's about time you called your uncle.
We gotta do this once a week.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.956
Once a week?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.719
So how's Lydia?

03:54.880 --> 03:56.598
She's a real tiger.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.439
I don't know how you do it.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.228
-What?
-Well, a man like you...

04:01.400 --> 04:05.188
...Iimiting yourself to one woman.
I don't know. It's none of my business.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.356
What are you talking about?

04:07.680 --> 04:10.353
-Well--
-Look at this.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.080
I told them medium rare.
It's medium.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.476
-lt happens.
-I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.159
He has no idea who you are.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.834
They don't just overcook
a hamburger, Jerry.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.951
Fine. Anyway, the point
I was making...

04:24.120 --> 04:27.271
...before Goebbels
made your hamburger here is this;

04:27.440 --> 04:30.716
A man like you could be
dating women 20 years younger.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.639
Come on, Uncle Leo,
I've seen the way women look at you.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.549
When's the last time you looked
in the mirror? You're an Adonis.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.870
You've got beautiful features,
lovely skin.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.516
You're in the prime of your life here.
You should be swinging.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.280
If I were you,
I'd tell this Lydia character;

04:46.480 --> 04:47.754
"It's been real."

04:47.920 --> 04:50.639
Move back into that bachelor pad
and put out a sign;

04:50.800 --> 04:53.314
"Open for business."

04:53.760 --> 04:55.113
Believe me, I thought about it...

04:55.280 --> 04:59.159
...but she is so perfect in every way,
I can't see a flaw.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.316
Well, keep looking.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.757
Oh, hi, Mr. Peterman.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.599
Do you realize how short
the Kalahari Bushmen are?

05:07.800 --> 05:10.712
I'm gonna look like a giant
to those guys.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.918
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Elaine.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.995
It appears you will not be
accompanying me to Africa.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.635
What? Why not?

05:19.840 --> 05:22.229
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.437
You've tested positive for opium.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.631
-Opium?
-That's right, Elaine.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.876
White Lotus. Yam-yam.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.270
Shanghai Sally.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.472
Well, that's impossible.
I've never done a drug in my life.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.631
Dr. Strugatz must have
made a mistake.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.432
Not a chance.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.876
I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone
else to accompany me on my journey.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.713
The Dark Continent
is no place for an addict, Elaine.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.073
Obviously, Mr. Peterman,
there's something wrong with this test.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.157
I don't take opium.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.118
Let me take another one, please?
I'll call the doctor right now.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.191
I'll take a pop urine test.

05:57.320 --> 06:01.279
-All right, Elaine.
-Oh, thank you, Mr. Peterman.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.790
I'll be ready in three minutes.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.277
Boy, it's cold outside, huh?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.113
Oh, these New York winters.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.633
Bitter cold. Bitter.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.593
I was out for five minutes before.
I couldn't feel my extremities.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.075
What extremities?

06:19.920 --> 06:23.356
You know what the temperature
in Florida is today?

06:23.520 --> 06:25.158
Seventy-nine.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.078
That's almost 80.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.712
Yeah, I read someplace,
the life expectancy in Florida...

06:30.880 --> 06:34.919
...is 81. And in Queens, 73.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.759
So, George, why are you here?

06:37.960 --> 06:42.238
What, I can't stop by
and visit my parents?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.913
What's this?

06:44.120 --> 06:47.078
That's where the Seinfelds
are moving. They got a great deal.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.390
-Yeah?
-You know what they got in Florida?

06:49.560 --> 06:50.913
Jai alai.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.594
You bet on the games,
you clean up.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.314
-I don't bet.
-Well, what about the dolphins?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.959
You can swim
with the dolphins there.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.230
I don't swim.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.198
Well, you could pet them.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.555
They come right out of the water
onto the sidewalks.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.752
Are you trying to get rid of us?

07:07.920 --> 07:12.072
"Rid"? Ma, come on.
The word is "care." "Care."

07:12.240 --> 07:13.719
I care about your comfort.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.353
Be it here in Queens...

07:15.520 --> 07:18.159
...or 1200 miles away.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.513
No?

07:28.120 --> 07:30.350
Jerry. Jerry!

07:33.280 --> 07:35.396
-You too, huh?
-Yeah.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.989
These showers are horrible.
There's no pressure.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.754
-I can't get the shampoo out.
-Me either.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.589
If I don't have a good shower, I am not
myself. I feel weak and ineffectual.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.591
-I'm not Kramer.
-You? What about me?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.079
I got The Tonight Show tonight.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.549
I'm gonna have to shower
in the dressing room.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.277
-Where you going?
-Well, I gotta find another shower.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.195
-They got you too?
-This is awful.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.918
I'm not Newman.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.754
-Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
-Kramer, you look terrible.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.878
Yeah. I need the keys to your
apartment. I gotta take a shower.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.117
-What's wrong with your shower?
-There's no water pressure.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.515
-Why didn't you go see Jerry?
-Jerry's got nothing.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.558
Newman's got nothing. You're
the one who's got the good stuff.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.196
And I need it bad, baby, because I feel
like I got bugs crawling up my skin.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.278
-Now, you gotta help me out.
-Not on my watch!

08:32.480 --> 08:34.914
I won't have you turning my office
into a den of iniquity!

08:35.080 --> 08:37.355
-What's wrong with you?
-Get your fix somewhere else!

08:37.760 --> 08:39.830
Go on, beat it!

08:42.880 --> 08:47.431
-Mr. Peterman, what are you doing?
-Elaine, you're out of control.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.999
You need help.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.716
I know what you're going through.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.678
I, too, once fell under the spell
of opium.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.314
It was 1979.
I was traveling the Yangtze...

08:57.480 --> 08:59.232
...in search
of a Mongolian horsehair vest.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.919
Oh, for God's sake.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.476
I had got to the market after sundown.
All of the clothing traders had gone.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.596
But a different sort of trader
still lurked.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.957
"Just a taste," he said.
That was all it took.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.869
Mr. Peterman, I don't know
what's going on here.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.237
I am not addicted to anything.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.670
Oh, Elaine.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.594
The toll road of denial
is a long and dangerous one.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.394
The price? Your soul.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.630
Oh, and by the way, you have
till 5:00 to clear out your desk.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.233
You're fired.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.078
-All they serve is chicken?
-There's more food down the hall.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.430
Here, wrap it up. We'll take it home.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.231
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hi.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.594
Hello, Seinfelds.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.637
-Hello.
-Hi, Estelle.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.400
This is your dressing room?
They treat you like Toscanini.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.152
Oh, Jerry, I don't know
how you can do this.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.151
I'm so nervous for you.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.713
Actually, I'm drunk.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.190
Hey. Hey, how is Florida, huh?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.152
We just bought a new place
down there.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.430
I know. We were looking
at the brochure.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.312
-You what?
-Why, you thinking of moving?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.556
-Not really.
-Because if you are, you shouldn't.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.312
There's nothing available there.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.399
Are you telling me there's not one
condo available in Del Boca Vista?

10:17.600 --> 10:20.398
That's right.
They went like hotcakes.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.232
-How'd you get yours?
-Got lucky.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.473
Are you trying to keep us out
of Del Boca Vista?

10:25.680 --> 10:27.511
I know this doesn't seem
like work to you...

10:27.680 --> 10:30.717
...but if you'd conduct the psychopath
convention down the hall...

10:30.920 --> 10:34.117
...so I could just get
a little personal space.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.515
How could I have
tested positive twice?

10:38.720 --> 10:41.518
Once, I can understand.
That's a mistake. But twice?

10:41.720 --> 10:43.312
Yeah, it's hard to figure.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.153
I mean, I've lost my job.
I can't go to Africa.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.590
I was gonna meet
the Bushmen of the Kalahari.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.756
-The Bushmen?
-And the Bushwomen.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.155
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.396
I notice you're eating
a poppy seed muffin there.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.192
Yeah, I eat these muffins
all the time.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.277
Well, you know what opium
is made from.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.273
Poppies!

11:06.240 --> 11:08.151
Welcome back.
Talking with Jerry Seinfeld.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.629
Jerry, let me ask you,
I saw some people back there...

11:10.800 --> 11:13.872
-... they look like family. Is that family?
-I got some family backstage.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.393
My family's nuts. They're crazy.

11:15.560 --> 11:17.471
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.676
My Uncle Leo,
I had lunch with him the other day.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.910
He's one of these guys
that anything goes wrong...

11:22.080 --> 11:23.354
...he blames anti-Semitism.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.597
Know what I mean? The spaghetti's
not al dente? Cook, anti-Semite.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.637
-Right there, yeah.
-Loses a bet on a horse?

11:28.800 --> 11:32.349
-Secretariat, anti-Semitic.
-Even the horse-- Even the animal.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.829
The High Holy Days in the temple?
Rabbi, anti-Semite.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.590
Listen to this. My Uncle Leo broke up
with his girlfriend because of my bit.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.638
She thought it was funny, so he
accused her of being an anti-Semite.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.189
They had a fight, now he's
moving back to his apartment.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.828
Know what this means? My parents
are gonna go back to Florida.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.353
What?

11:55.520 --> 11:57.351
What number is this?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.470
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.596
Kramer, my parents are gonna have to
move back to Florida. Isn't that great?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.558
Yeah, well, I'm really happy for you.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.790
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man.
What's wrong?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.873
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.993
-No good?
-It's disgusting.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.914
I'm sitting there in a tepid pool
of my own filth.

12:22.080 --> 12:26.596
All kinds of microscopic parasites
and organisms...

12:26.760 --> 12:28.990
...having sex all around me.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.877
Well, you used to sit
in that hot tub.

12:32.080 --> 12:35.868
Jerry, that was super-heated water.
Nothing could live in that.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.514
-Chicken?
-Oh, yeah.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.038
Well, this you're not gonna believe.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.879
I found out why
I was testing positive for opium.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.349
-Poppy seeds.
-Poppy seeds.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.391
-Yep, that makes sense.
-Yeah.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.391
-Here you want some chicken?
-Yeah, thanks.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.319
So I'm gonna get tested again later.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.871
Hopefully I'll get my job back,
and I will be on my way to Africa.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.676
Hello, Newman.

13:03.080 --> 13:08.598
Hello, Jerry. Well, I may have
a solution to our little problem.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.470
-Elaine, will you excuse us?
-Oh, come on, Newman.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.114
I have a private matter to discuss
with my fellow tenants.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.759
If you don't mind....

13:16.960 --> 13:18.712
-Jerry--
-Look, sister, go get yourself...

13:18.880 --> 13:20.871
...a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.793
All right. Now, here's the lowdown.
Through a certain connection...

13:25.960 --> 13:28.520
...I've been able to locate
some black-market showerheads.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.836
They're all made
in the former Yugoslavia.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.032
And from what I hear, the Serbs
are fanatic about their showers.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.435
Not from the footage I've seen.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.719
Nevertheless,
sometime this afternoon...

13:42.880 --> 13:45.952
...behind the market diner,
an unmarked van will be waiting.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.680
I'm expecting the call at any time.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.115
-Are you in?
-I'm down.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.793
Jerry?

13:58.000 --> 14:02.232
So, Georgie,
we have some big news for you.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.233
-Big news?
-We're moving to Florida.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.313
What?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.909
You're moving to Florida?

14:10.080 --> 14:13.470
That's wonderful. I'm so happy!

14:13.640 --> 14:15.995
For you! I'm so happy for you!

14:16.160 --> 14:18.549
Oh, what do you need
this cold weather for?

14:18.760 --> 14:20.034
Has nothing to do with weather.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.236
-It's because of the Seinfelds.
-What do you mean?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.954
They don't want us there,
so we're going.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.356
We're moving right into
Del Boca Vista!

14:30.400 --> 14:32.630
-So you're moving there for spite.
-Absolutely.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.599
No one tells Frank Costanza
what to do!

14:36.800 --> 14:40.190
That's right! Who the hell are they?
How dare they?

14:42.560 --> 14:45.279
So, Georgie, are you gonna
come to visit us?

14:45.440 --> 14:49.433
Oh, every chance I get.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.119
Jerry, Jerry!
I'm busting, I'm busting!

14:54.320 --> 14:56.959
-Well, what's going on?
-My parents are moving to Florida!

14:57.160 --> 14:59.674
-Are you kidding?
-Can you believe it? It's happening!

14:59.840 --> 15:02.229
It's finally happening, I'm free!

15:02.440 --> 15:05.113
-Well, where are they moving to?
-Del Boca Vista.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.958
That's where my parents
are gonna live.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.752
-I know.
-We can visit together.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.234
Every five years!

15:12.480 --> 15:15.392
-That's incredible.
-You know why they're moving there?

15:15.560 --> 15:17.278
-Why?
-To spite your parents.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.714
-To spite my parents?
-Yeah.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.440
-Your parents are crazy.
-I know, they're out of their mind.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.993
-I don't believe it.
-Fantastic.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.316
-My parents are moving back too.
-Beautiful!

15:27.480 --> 15:31.234
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here.
I'm not ready to go back to Florida.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.433
He was getting along so well
with that woman. What happened?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.074
Hello?

15:39.240 --> 15:42.710
-This is Frank Costanza.
-What do you want?

15:42.880 --> 15:45.599
You think you can keep us
out of Florida?

15:45.800 --> 15:49.156
We're moving in
lock, stock and barrel.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.038
We're gonna be in the pool.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.031
We're gonna be in the clubhouse.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.919
We're gonna be all over
that shuffleboard court...

15:56.080 --> 15:59.629
...and I dare you to keep me out!

16:01.560 --> 16:03.755
I'm sorry, we can't go back
to Florida.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.557
I can't believe
I didn't push for this sooner.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.672
You have no idea how your life
is gonna improve as a result of this.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.398
Food tastes better.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.596
The air seems fresher.
You'll have more energy...

16:19.760 --> 16:22.479
...and self-confidence
than you ever dreamed of.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.037
-Hello.
-Hello, Jerry, it's your father.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.593
-Oh, hi, Dad.
-ls it all right...

16:27.760 --> 16:30.399
...if we move in with you
for a little while?

16:31.280 --> 16:34.670
-What was that?
-Nothing. A bottle broke, that's all.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.796
What do you mean,
you're gonna move in here?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.468
Because the Costanzas
are moving in to Del Boca Vista.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.240
-But it's a big complex.
-You don't understand.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.635
You gotta have a buffer zone.

16:45.160 --> 16:48.311
All right, fine. Come over here.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.473
What?

16:50.640 --> 16:53.200
They're not going back to Florida.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.476
-They're moving here.
-What? Why?

16:55.680 --> 16:57.910
Because your parents
are going down there.

16:58.080 --> 17:01.470
My buffer zone just went from
1200 miles down to two feet.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.629
You gotta do something.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.749
Hey, I'm sorry. You had
your buffer zone for many years.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.309
It's my time to live, baby.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.632
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.358
You're killing independent Jerry.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.309
I gotta go see my Uncle Leo.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.118
I think he may have made
a big mistake.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.757
-Move back with Lydia?
-Come on.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.512
You're lucky to have anybody.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.631
Last week you told me I was
in my prime. I should be swinging.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.308
Swinging?
What, are you out of your mind?

17:33.480 --> 17:35.198
Look at you. You're disgusting.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.514
You're bald. You're paunchy.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.917
All kinds of sounds are emanating
from your body 24 hours a day.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.835
If there's a woman that can take your
presence for more than 10 seconds...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.070
...you should hang on to her
like grim death.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.549
Which is not far off, by the way.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.309
-But she's an anti-Semite.
-Can you blame her?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.675
You don't think he minds
us staying here, do you?

17:56.880 --> 17:59.633
Why would he mind?
We're his parents.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.838
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hello.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.959
-Jerry's not here?
-No.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.357
-Oh, my God.
-What?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.636
A poppy seed.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.950
It must have been in the chicken.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.872
Oh, I'm dead.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.996
I'm going to the doctor's
in a half an hour.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.475
-Why?
-It's a long story.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.750
Just a second.
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.750
Wait. What are you gonna do
in there?

18:28.920 --> 18:30.399
What am I gonna do
in the bathroom?

18:30.560 --> 18:31.595
You gotta do me a favour.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.554
-Elaine, I really have--
-Hold on a second, Mrs. Seinfeld.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.955
I need your sample.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.519
You want my urine?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.836
I need a clean urine sample
from a woman.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.713
-I don't know.
-Oh, please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.512
Well, what am I gonna do it in?

18:46.560 --> 18:49.518
-Well, one of those glasses.
-Jerry's glasses?

18:49.720 --> 18:53.759
Oh, yeah. He won't mind.
Come on, you're his mom.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.514
I could-- Should I use a coffee cup?

18:57.680 --> 19:00.353
-Yeah, coffee cup's fine.
-Or maybe I could use a juice glass.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.636
Yes, yes. Fine, fine.
A juice glass. It's perfect.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.115
-This one is kind of scratched.
-lt doesn't matter.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.352
-All right. How--? A milk glass.
-A milk glass, a juice glass.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.353
-Any glass, just pick a glass.
-Jerry really doesn't...

19:11.520 --> 19:14.398
-...wash these very well.
-Mrs. Seinfeld, choose a glass.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.955
Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.992
All right. I got everything here.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.957
I got the Cyclone F series...

19:22.160 --> 19:25.118
...Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm
Superstream, you name it.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.719
What do you recommend?

19:26.920 --> 19:29.275
-What are you looking for?
-Power, man, power.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.714
Like Silkwood.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.758
-That's for radiation.
-That's right.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.791
Now, what is this?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.991
That's the Commando 450.
I don't sell that one.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.952
No, that's what we want,
the Commando 450.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.754
No, believe me. That's only used
in the circus for elephants.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.757
-Just give it to us.
-We'll pay anything.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.036
-Give me the money.
-We've got the....

19:47.200 --> 19:49.714
-What about Jerry?
-He couldn't handle that.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.154
He's delicate.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.432
It's nice being back at Leo's.
Jerry's place was too small.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.392
First Leo breaks up,
then he goes back.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.551
What the hell's going on?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.711
-Who is it?
-It's the super.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.998
We're installing new low-flow
showerheads in all the bathrooms.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.559
Low-flow?

20:07.720 --> 20:09.836
I don't like the sound of that.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.837
So as a result of your test
being free of opium...

20:14.000 --> 20:17.276
-...I am reinstating you.
-Oh, yes!

20:17.440 --> 20:19.396
What a load off.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.795
So when are we going to Africa?

20:21.960 --> 20:23.518
I'm afraid I can't take you.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.073
What? Why not?

20:26.240 --> 20:29.277
Elaine, according to your
urine analysis, you're menopausal.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.349
You have the metabolism
of a 68-year-old woman.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.193
But I wanted to see the Bushmen.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.312
Oh, and one more thing.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.879
You may have osteoporosis.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.355
-Well, it's been a great visit.
-Jerry, I'll tell you.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.557
First thing I'm gonna do when
I get back to Florida is take a shower.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.115
At least the Costanzas
changed their mind about moving.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.471
-They couldn't bear leaving George.
-George must be happy about that.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.911
You have no idea.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.790
Take my swim trunks.
I won't need them.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.594
What does he want
with your swim trunks?

21:01.880 --> 21:03.552
Why should they go to waste?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.477
Oh, yeah.
