00:02.810 --> 00:05.073
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?

00:05.233 --> 00:06.999
I'm gonna finish this.

00:09.158 --> 00:11.130
We had dinner
with Stella's sister and her fiancÃ©?

00:11.250 --> 00:13.518
- They're getting married before us.
- How you've dreamt

00:13.638 --> 00:15.879
about your perfect wedding day
when you were a little girl?

00:16.126 --> 00:17.630
- Yeah.
- Totally.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.591
My sister is stealing
my dream wedding.

00:20.014 --> 00:23.472
Down to every last detail
on Shelter Island, at sunset...

00:23.853 --> 00:27.435
... just down the beach
from our family's old summer house.

00:28.043 --> 00:29.772
It's my dream wedding.

00:30.388 --> 00:31.922
I'm gonna finish this.

00:34.511 --> 00:37.825
- The lamb here is supposed to be great.
- I'm a vegan.

00:38.166 --> 00:40.203
I wish I could tune out
that moral voice

00:40.363 --> 00:42.623
inside me
that says eating animals is murder,

00:43.296 --> 00:46.335
but I guess I'm just not
as strong as you are.

00:46.685 --> 00:48.213
That's 'cause you need protein.

00:49.830 --> 00:51.159
I'll have the lamb.

00:53.482 --> 00:54.887
Okay, new goal:

00:55.188 --> 00:57.601
I want our wedding
to kick her wedding's ass.

00:57.879 --> 01:00.055
I want our wedding
to take her wedding's head

01:00.175 --> 01:02.733
and shove it in the toilet
and flush it, like,20 times.

01:03.595 --> 01:06.237
Ted, in high school,
you were her wedding, weren't you?

01:07.850 --> 01:11.100
You know,she's always trying
to one-up me. I mean, I love her, but,

01:11.220 --> 01:13.998
there's a part of me that kinda wishes
this whole thing would just fall apart.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.251
I hate him. I hate him!

01:16.411 --> 01:18.671
I hate him.
God, this steak is so good!

01:18.970 --> 01:20.506
Four days to go and he just runs off

01:20.666 --> 01:22.536
with the vitamin consultant
from Whole Foods?

01:22.656 --> 01:25.718
I gave up makeup for him.
I gave up showering for him.

01:25.838 --> 01:27.515
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.

01:27.819 --> 01:30.165
Hard to imagine
where it all went wrong.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.181
Now it's so close to the wedding...
There's like bacon or something

01:33.301 --> 01:35.509
in this dipping sauce. I love it.
I can't get any refunds.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.529
I'm gonna be out
thousands of dollars.

01:37.689 --> 01:39.281
<i>Kids, when you're in a relationship,</i>

01:39.593 --> 01:41.993
<i>you develop a kind
of telepathy with your partner.</i>

01:42.550 --> 01:43.719
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:43.969 --> 01:45.207
<i>We could help her out.</i>

01:45.663 --> 01:46.715
<i>No, Stella,</i>

01:47.265 --> 01:48.897
<i>we should help her out.</i>

01:50.027 --> 01:51.521
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>

01:52.864 --> 01:54.643
Nora. Don't worry.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.018
We got this.

01:57.312 --> 01:59.282
That's right.
We'll take over your wedding,

01:59.403 --> 02:01.233
pay you back
for everything you spent.

02:01.352 --> 02:03.146
Ted and I will get married
this Sunday.

02:06.436 --> 02:08.681

02:24.033 --> 02:25.719
We're getting married this Sunday?

02:26.341 --> 02:27.805
Are we sure we're ready for this?

02:28.234 --> 02:30.900
Ted, I wasted years
trying to get Lucy's dad

02:31.020 --> 02:33.146
to decide he was "ready" for this,

02:33.305 --> 02:36.475
but he never got ready for this.
That's why we never got married.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.910
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.

02:39.030 --> 02:42.115
I used to dream that Tony
would be spontaneous like this.

02:42.793 --> 02:44.076
Okay, I'm in.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.663
And I'm also... spontaneous.

02:51.347 --> 02:52.796
I wish I hadn't done that.

02:54.510 --> 02:57.328
<i>Kids, morals usually
come at the end of stories,</i>

02:57.449 --> 03:00.041
<i>but this one is so important,
I'm gonna tell you now:</i>

03:00.161 --> 03:02.894
<i>Don't ever, ever
invite an ex to your wedding.</i>

03:03.292 --> 03:06.481
<i>If someone had given me that advice,
well, it'd've changed everything.</i>

03:06.731 --> 03:08.984
Come on, you've got to come,
it's my wedding.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.980
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.

03:11.471 --> 03:14.352
It's my first week on the job.
I can't just take off.

03:14.748 --> 03:17.837
Plus, I'm finally
doing serious news.

03:19.515 --> 03:21.209
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>

03:21.671 --> 03:24.047
<i>It was the number one
English news network in Japan.</i>

03:24.206 --> 03:26.498
<i>Of course, the news was
a little different over there.</i>

03:29.987 --> 03:32.759
The Federal Reserve Board voted
to leave interest...

03:33.935 --> 03:35.186
rates unchanged.

03:35.721 --> 03:37.966
It's my wedding.
You have to be there.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.442
Okay. I'll be there.
I gotta go.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.119
Good evening.

03:46.390 --> 03:48.328
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.866
Peace talks were stalled once again
in the Middle East.

03:51.986 --> 03:55.349
Despite a promising start
in the latest negotiations,

03:55.764 --> 03:58.317
talks foundered on security issues.

03:59.003 --> 03:59.908
She's in.

04:00.977 --> 04:03.038
All right,
your bachelor party, tonight.

04:03.158 --> 04:05.646
I have got three of the most
physically and morally

04:05.766 --> 04:08.165
flexible exotic dancers
you've ever seen...

04:08.285 --> 04:10.273
- There's no time.
- I'll let you know how it goes.

04:10.394 --> 04:12.873
We should really rent
the cars for tomorrow?

04:17.363 --> 04:20.462
- What?
- No, "Don't get married, Ted"?

04:20.716 --> 04:23.138
No, "You're making
a big mistake, Ted"?

04:23.438 --> 04:24.586
Barney Stinson...

04:25.188 --> 04:28.591
are you no longer committed
to the war on marriage?

04:29.010 --> 04:31.463
No, I just know
a hopeless cause when I see it.

04:32.079 --> 04:34.230
It's the same reason
I don't recycle.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.412
Plus, Ted getting married

04:36.690 --> 04:38.419
is in my best interest.

04:38.815 --> 04:39.892
You see...

04:40.012 --> 04:43.104
Lately I've been working on a problem
of the utmost importance.

04:45.111 --> 04:46.679
I confess I was stumped.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.998
Until one night I decided
to tackle it once and for all.

05:04.145 --> 05:05.901
Then, at last,

05:06.550 --> 05:07.768
I cracked the code.

05:14.783 --> 05:16.862
- So you're back on Robin.
- Hopefully.

05:17.982 --> 05:21.160
I mean, this weekend is the best chance
ever to hook up with her again.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.289
You'll never pull it off.
There's too many distractions.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.686
The first drunk bridesmaid you see,

05:26.806 --> 05:29.922
you'll have your head under her dress
like an old-time photographer.

05:30.543 --> 05:32.175
Lily, don't cheapen this.

05:32.861 --> 05:36.175
I don't want to sound all
mushy-gushy and romantic,

05:36.856 --> 05:39.559
but this weekend,
Robin is the only woman I'm banging.

05:41.379 --> 05:42.898
<i>And so, the day before our wedding,</i>

05:43.182 --> 05:45.985
<i>Stella and I made the trip up
to Shelter Island.</i>

05:46.553 --> 05:48.531
<i>With everyone else not far behind.</i>

05:49.236 --> 05:50.950
- Zitch dog.
- Z... Zog...

05:53.499 --> 05:56.556
This isn't exactly
where I pictured Ted getting married.

05:56.797 --> 05:59.586
"The Namaste Yoga
and Meditation Collective."

05:59.746 --> 06:02.257
I don't know about you, but Nama-stay
here any longer than I have to.

06:04.816 --> 06:07.013
Sweetie,
go check in with that dirty hippie

06:07.173 --> 06:09.212
over there
and we'll get some drinks.

06:12.909 --> 06:14.230
What scotches you got?

06:14.391 --> 06:17.736
Here at the center,
we have a very strict no-alcohol policy.

06:20.051 --> 06:22.061
Great, and all the meals
are included, right?

06:22.911 --> 06:24.746
And they're all 100% vegan.

06:27.323 --> 06:28.818
I need alcohol.

06:29.064 --> 06:31.588
I'm not gonna get Robin
with this stuff.

06:32.011 --> 06:33.080
Look at this.

06:33.201 --> 06:36.752
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.676
My God, some of these drinks
could actually make a girl smarter.

06:39.795 --> 06:41.725
What sort of hell
has Ted brought us to?

06:41.846 --> 06:44.521
- There's no meat.
- There's no alcohol.

06:45.403 --> 06:47.738
It gets worse:
I'm 90% sure that guy

06:47.858 --> 06:50.809
you were talking with used to be
lead singer of the Spin Doctors.

06:53.047 --> 06:53.867
Hey, guys,

06:55.092 --> 06:56.621
Stella and I have a little problem.

06:57.099 --> 06:58.624
The programs look great.

06:59.449 --> 07:02.295
I mean, it's not our names on the front,
but otherwise, really nice.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.678
I talked to Robin.

07:04.798 --> 07:07.468
She's running a little bit late,
but she'll be here just under the wire.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.515
- You invited Robin?
- Yeah, of course.

07:11.025 --> 07:14.311
You never told me that.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.366
Can I help?

07:16.632 --> 07:18.024
You feel glad.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.234
- You like Robin.
- Yeah, but

07:21.354 --> 07:22.876
she's your ex-girlfriend.

07:22.996 --> 07:24.420
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

07:24.540 --> 07:25.564
It's weird.

07:25.685 --> 07:28.663
You don't get what it's like for a bride
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.

07:32.232 --> 07:35.381
Your new husband used to nail me,
like, three times a day.

07:38.587 --> 07:39.971
Having exes around,

07:40.755 --> 07:42.391
I don't know, it brings up...

07:42.880 --> 07:44.309
unresolved things.

07:45.346 --> 07:48.064
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?

07:48.184 --> 07:51.528
Come on, we're just friends. Plus,
Robin and I already had our backslide

07:51.649 --> 07:54.096
last Thanksgiving,
not even that long ago.

07:54.215 --> 07:56.576
Did you place a large bet
against yourself in this argument?

07:57.225 --> 07:58.852
She already got her ticket.

07:59.866 --> 08:03.136
It's important to me.
I would never invite Lucy's dad.

08:03.256 --> 08:05.880
I wouldn't care if you did.
Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.

08:06.154 --> 08:09.209
Tony is the last person
I want at our wedding, okay?

08:12.116 --> 08:13.891
And Robin is a close second.

08:15.813 --> 08:17.848
Robin's probably
about to get on the plane.

08:17.968 --> 08:20.232
Plus, she left
a really important job for this.

08:20.392 --> 08:22.791
Spurred by environmental concerns

08:22.910 --> 08:25.244
and high gasoline prices,

08:25.573 --> 08:29.996
sales of hybrid vehicles have risen
11% over the previous year.

08:30.509 --> 08:31.789
What should I do?

08:32.246 --> 08:34.751
I don't know.
I kinda get the no exes thing.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.921
Why ask a failed romance to come
and watch your successful one?

08:38.041 --> 08:40.755
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners
to a World Series game.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.443
It's weird for everyone.

08:42.964 --> 08:45.099
What? Robin has to come.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.101
Right, she's, like, my best friend.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.980
Female friend.
My best female friend.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.484
I don't care, why fake it.

08:53.853 --> 08:56.572
- Dude, Robin has to be here.
- She shouldn't come.

08:56.811 --> 08:59.284
- What are you talk...
- Justice Aldrin, tie-breaking vote.

09:02.359 --> 09:06.001
Wouldn't feel right without Robin.
But you don't mess with the bride.

09:07.390 --> 09:11.071
- I'm gonna tell her not to come.
- It's the right decision, Ted.

09:11.191 --> 09:14.137
This is gonna be, like, the worst
phone conversation of all time.

09:15.704 --> 09:17.015
Co-best man, I'm on it.

09:23.142 --> 09:24.944
- Hello?
- Where are you?

09:25.104 --> 09:26.922
Just heading to the airport.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.825
We'll see you soon.
Have a great flight.

09:32.563 --> 09:34.859
Bad news.
I couldn't reach her.

09:34.979 --> 09:36.667
Robin's already on her way.

09:41.923 --> 09:44.803
Robin's on her way.
You know what, I'm glad.

09:45.257 --> 09:47.396
Exes should be allowed
to come to weddings.

09:47.516 --> 09:49.624
I'll just tell Stella
she's got to deal with it.

09:49.744 --> 09:53.231
You need to be more delicate with Stella
about this whole Robin thing.

09:53.391 --> 09:56.291
- What do you mean by delicate?
- Brides are under a lot of stress

09:56.410 --> 09:57.461
before a wedding.

09:57.581 --> 10:00.198
I mean, of course,
I held it together pretty well.

10:02.659 --> 10:03.703
You don't remember?

10:05.946 --> 10:09.684
The florist just told me
the roses are more light medium-pink

10:09.804 --> 10:11.247
than medium-pink.

10:11.367 --> 10:14.551
Light medium-pink!
Everything's ruined.

10:16.675 --> 10:19.270
Our wedding site uses
a gravity furnace

10:19.390 --> 10:21.203
instead of forced-air heating.

10:21.323 --> 10:25.306
That's the one thing I cared about.
Why are we even getting married?

10:35.409 --> 10:37.457
After a while, it's all noise.

10:38.744 --> 10:41.921
Poor Stella's had to jam months
of crazy into just three days.

10:42.081 --> 10:44.996
- So what do I do?
- You wait for the next crisis,

10:45.116 --> 10:46.880
you solve it, you're a hero.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.223
Then you bring up the Robin thing,
but this time she'll say yes.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.811
But what if there's no next crisis?

10:53.332 --> 10:56.649
She's a bride.
There will be a next crisis.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.948
- There's an next crisis.
- Awesome! What is it?

11:02.612 --> 11:05.703
My daughter, my own daughter
isn't coming to our wedding.

11:05.998 --> 11:06.865
What?

11:07.331 --> 11:09.887
Tony's supposed to drive her up
tomorrow, but now he's being all petty

11:10.007 --> 11:12.047
about me getting married,
and he won't do it.

11:12.167 --> 11:15.048
It's been five years.
Why can't we just move on already?

11:15.467 --> 11:18.094
So first thing tomorrow,
I drive down, talk to him,

11:18.369 --> 11:21.974
get him to let me drive Lucy up,
then, boom, crisis solved.

11:22.094 --> 11:24.270
Stella's happy.
Robin comes to the wedding.

11:26.670 --> 11:28.442
- You Barney?
- Yes.

11:28.602 --> 11:30.778
I hear you're a real man whore,
so listen up.

11:31.404 --> 11:34.747
Tomorrow night, I want to do things
so dirty and so depraved

11:34.867 --> 11:37.334
that I forget that this was supposed
to be my wedding.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.332
I'm kind of here with someone.

11:40.719 --> 11:41.719
Bring her.

11:42.521 --> 11:44.423
You're never gonna make it.

11:45.935 --> 11:48.706
<i>So, the morning of my wedding day
I made the trip back</i>

11:48.879 --> 11:49.970
<i>to Tony's house</i>

11:50.130 --> 11:51.197
<i>to get Lucy.</i>

11:56.453 --> 11:58.148
Doing a little karate?

12:01.057 --> 12:02.319
Sorry, sorry, man.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.990
You set off my internal defense alarm.
You got to watch these things.

12:06.151 --> 12:07.994
- Stay alert, stay alive.
- Right.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.540
So what brings you here?
I thought you'd be off

12:10.660 --> 12:12.793
in some honeymoon suite
with my woman right now.

12:13.069 --> 12:14.502
Not yet. Soon.

12:14.663 --> 12:16.808
That's right, tonight's the night.

12:17.132 --> 12:18.131
Oh, man,

12:18.251 --> 12:21.011
you are going to be sticking it
to the mother of my child.

12:21.328 --> 12:23.544
Actually, I've already stuck it
to her plenty of times.

12:23.664 --> 12:25.569
Why do I always have
to correct people?

12:25.689 --> 12:26.970
You and Stella.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.665
You lucky dog. I could just...

12:33.981 --> 12:35.657
I'm so happy for you, guys.

12:37.041 --> 12:39.108
Listen, here's the thing...

12:40.196 --> 12:42.300
- You can't take her.
- Tony, stop.

12:43.595 --> 12:45.398
This is a big day for Lucy, too.

12:45.518 --> 12:47.468
You're going to have
to put aside your own issues

12:47.588 --> 12:50.384
and think about what's best for her,
here. Whether you like it or not,

12:50.545 --> 12:52.769
she really should be at
her mother's wedding.

12:52.890 --> 12:54.222
I'm taking Lucy with me.

12:58.853 --> 13:00.230
You're right, man.

13:00.637 --> 13:01.706
You're right.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

13:05.157 --> 13:06.548
seeing you guys...

13:07.848 --> 13:09.742
has made me realize
everything I had.

13:12.577 --> 13:13.962
Let's stop hugging.

13:14.844 --> 13:15.844
I'm sorry.

13:17.413 --> 13:19.193
Lucy means the world to me.

13:19.312 --> 13:22.835
I feel like I'm losing her to this new
family, a family I'm not even a part of.

13:23.004 --> 13:25.973
- Come on, sure you are.
- I wasn't even invited to the wedding.

13:26.276 --> 13:27.434
You are now.

13:32.047 --> 13:33.291
Road trip.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.444
Right?

13:38.915 --> 13:41.288
"Road Trip 2. Back in the Car".

13:44.649 --> 13:46.751
Today's the day. You hydrating?

13:48.037 --> 13:50.881
Dear female, thank you
for your interest in Barney Stinson...

13:51.001 --> 13:53.468
Your back is going to look like
a Jackson Pollock.

13:54.373 --> 13:56.993
I regret to inform you
that at this time...

13:57.467 --> 14:00.143
I was a vegan for two years.
I need meat.

14:01.036 --> 14:03.482
There are currently
no positions available.

14:03.739 --> 14:06.998
I'm a yoga instructor.
Every position is available.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.783
Your room, 20 minutes.
No foreplay.

14:13.616 --> 14:16.576
- I'm not going to make it, am I?
- Not a chance.

14:21.234 --> 14:24.593
- Remember, let me talk to Stella first.
- Mommy!

14:25.908 --> 14:27.552
Ted invited Daddy!

14:28.138 --> 14:30.159
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.353
Give me just a sec, okay?

14:36.452 --> 14:38.319
You invited Tony?
To our wedding?

14:39.648 --> 14:42.181
We talked about this.
No exes at our wedding.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.707
- Why would you do this?
- Oh, boy.

14:45.031 --> 14:46.763
What did Ted do this time?

14:53.020 --> 14:55.933
What is Robin doing here?
I thought I made myself clear.

14:56.053 --> 14:57.511
No exes at our wedding.

14:58.505 --> 14:59.691
To be fair...

15:00.366 --> 15:02.560
- your ex is here.
- You invited him!

15:02.720 --> 15:04.938
- Come on, it's not weird.
- It is weird.

15:05.593 --> 15:07.608
It's like things are not finished
between you two.

15:08.562 --> 15:09.638
And Tony...

15:10.027 --> 15:12.154
I can't deal with Tony now.
Can you please go out there

15:12.274 --> 15:14.890
and tell him to leave?
You can make me the bad guy.

15:15.296 --> 15:17.913
I'll go talk to Robin,
so she knows it's nothing personal.

15:20.714 --> 15:23.628
<i>And, kids, if I had just let
Stella talk to Robin,</i>

15:23.747 --> 15:25.674
<i>this whole story might have
ended differently.</i>

15:26.281 --> 15:27.217
I understand.

15:28.431 --> 15:29.441
I get it.

15:30.216 --> 15:33.517
<i>For the first time,
Ted and Stella Mosby.</i>

15:34.724 --> 15:37.009
<i>And that's how I met your mother.</i>

15:38.084 --> 15:40.104
Is your dad finally done yakking?

15:40.224 --> 15:42.442
Now, come on, who wants ice cream?

15:43.620 --> 15:44.737
<i>But I didn't.</i>

15:45.035 --> 15:47.753
Can you talk to Tony?
Robin flew all the way here from Tokyo.

15:47.873 --> 15:49.175
I should talk to her.

15:50.564 --> 15:51.374
Sure.

15:58.385 --> 16:00.500
- Sorry about running off like that.
- It's okay.

16:00.620 --> 16:04.752
You would not believe the trip I had.
I was on a plane for almost a full day.

16:04.872 --> 16:07.855
It's worth it to see you get married.
How could I not be here...?

16:08.015 --> 16:09.941
- You can't come to the wedding.
- Thank God!

16:10.061 --> 16:10.984
What?

16:11.144 --> 16:13.487
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

16:13.648 --> 16:16.909
It is weird. Do you know how it feels
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?

16:20.391 --> 16:22.330
Suck it, bitch! I win!

16:24.370 --> 16:26.171
We broke up over a year ago.

16:26.332 --> 16:28.607
Yeah, but that's not that long ago.

16:28.991 --> 16:30.657
Watching your marry another woman

16:30.777 --> 16:33.265
isn't exactly something
I was looking forward to.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.178
I don't know, I just thought
if I ever changed my mind about

16:37.298 --> 16:38.999
marriage and kids, it was...

16:39.310 --> 16:41.525
it was nice to know
that you were there.

16:41.685 --> 16:43.861
So, I was your safety school.
How flattering.

16:44.022 --> 16:46.959
- That's not it. It's just that...
- Why are you bringing any of this up?

16:47.079 --> 16:49.536
- There's nothing between us anymore.
- Maybe there is.

16:50.698 --> 16:53.618
I mean, of course there is.
That kind of stuff

16:53.923 --> 16:56.128
doesn't disappear without a trace.

16:57.205 --> 16:59.258
I'm not just another guest here.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.521
Right. We used to date, but...

17:01.955 --> 17:04.320
we both moved on.
And, look, we got what we wanted.

17:04.441 --> 17:07.037
I'm getting married,
you got your dream job in Tokyo.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.454
- And they all lived happily ever...
- I quit my job.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.900
- You what?
- I'm moving back to New York.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.496
I thought I wanted that job, but...

17:15.400 --> 17:17.573
I want to come back to my real life.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.952
And I think you should
go back to yours.

17:21.964 --> 17:23.771
What's that supposed to mean?

17:26.795 --> 17:27.878
Don't get married.

17:29.464 --> 17:31.234
Look, you're rushing into this.

17:31.355 --> 17:34.679
It's like you're trying to skip ahead
to the end of the book.

17:34.799 --> 17:36.744
You're the most romantic guy I know.

17:36.865 --> 17:38.987
You stole a blue French horn for me.

17:39.107 --> 17:40.562
You tried to make it rain.

17:40.723 --> 17:42.755
- I did make it rain.
- It was a coincidence.

17:43.065 --> 17:47.401
But after all that, this is how your
great romantic quest comes to an end?

17:47.786 --> 17:50.194
You're just disappearing
into someone else's wedding,

17:50.313 --> 17:53.621
someone else's house, someone
else's life without a second thought.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.642
That's not the amazing ending
that you deserve.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.081
That's not Ted Mosby.

18:05.153 --> 18:06.180
I love Stella.

18:07.675 --> 18:08.641
She's the one.

18:09.970 --> 18:11.458
If you really feel that way...

18:12.616 --> 18:15.444
I guess it's a good thing you're not
coming to the wedding after all.

18:24.951 --> 18:26.540
- Big fight?
- Yeah.

18:28.172 --> 18:28.976
Here...

18:30.529 --> 18:31.821
It's on the house.

18:32.330 --> 18:33.880
Just keep 'em coming.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.326
God, do not keep them coming.

18:46.479 --> 18:48.236
I am having a horrible day.

18:48.396 --> 18:51.990
I snuck some scotch in from the duty
free store. You want to join me?

18:52.842 --> 18:54.792
Let's go to your room.
Far away from this room.

18:54.912 --> 18:58.154
- And we can knock it back.
- They didn't get me a room.

18:58.274 --> 19:00.377
I was actually hoping
I could stay with you.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.475
No problem.

19:02.991 --> 19:05.626
I just have to straighten up
a little bit.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.974
I've got some clothes
on the floor, and...

19:08.094 --> 19:10.599
And a naked girl tied
to your headboard.

19:10.759 --> 19:12.852
Towels all over the bathroom.
It's a mess.

19:14.097 --> 19:16.231
So, anyway...
Give me ten minutes

19:16.467 --> 19:18.817
- to get the place in order...
- See ya, Barney.

19:31.150 --> 19:32.836
Okay, let's do this.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.186
Who the hell is that?

19:36.316 --> 19:38.623
It's the girl from the front desk.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.483
<i>Kids, sometimes you think
you're living out one story,</i>

19:51.201 --> 19:54.208
<i>but the truth turns out
to be something else entirely.</i>

20:00.093 --> 20:01.523
<i>At the time I thought the story</i>

20:01.643 --> 20:04.021
<i>was about whether Robin should be
at the wedding.</i>

20:11.369 --> 20:13.976
<i>If only I'd understood
what the real story was.</i>

20:23.291 --> 20:26.658
Having exes around...
I don't know, it brings up

20:27.152 --> 20:28.911
unresolved things.

20:33.068 --> 20:36.005
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?

20:40.003 --> 20:42.309
Like things are not finished
between you two.

20:44.842 --> 20:47.543
I wasted years trying to get
Lucy's dad to decide

20:47.663 --> 20:49.189
if he was ready for this.

20:49.476 --> 20:50.769
Seeing you guys...

20:52.193 --> 20:54.189
It's made me realize
everything I had.

20:54.309 --> 20:57.700
I used to dream that Tony would be
spontaneous like this.

21:03.591 --> 21:04.899
<i>Seriously, kids,</i>

21:05.341 --> 21:07.008
<i>never invite an ex</i>

21:07.420 --> 21:08.630
<i>to your wedding.</i>
