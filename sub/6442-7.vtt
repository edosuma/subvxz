00:30.700 --> 00:33.828
How tasteless is this?
I think they even used real meteor rock.

00:34.003 --> 00:35.470
The American version of closure.

00:35.638 --> 00:37.265
You can only get over your grief...

00:37.440 --> 00:39.567
...when you can
merchandise your tragedy.

00:39.743 --> 00:42.405
Cotton candy.
Come on.

00:42.779 --> 00:45.475
Hi. One cotton candy, please.

00:46.216 --> 00:49.276
Sometimes I think it'd be nice
to get away from all this.

00:49.452 --> 00:52.615
Maybe Clark was right.
Just leave it all behind.

00:52.789 --> 00:56.054
We almost went an entire day without
mentioning our favorite farm boy.

00:56.226 --> 00:59.252
Sorry. I didn't mean to throw
a wet towel over our girls' day out.

00:59.429 --> 01:01.761
It's okay. I just feel I should
take this moment...

01:01.931 --> 01:03.922
...to state something very obvious.

01:04.768 --> 01:08.101
Clark not dating you
was his loss, not yours.

01:08.271 --> 01:10.831
-Okay?
-Lana Lang. Hey!

01:11.341 --> 01:13.639
Lana Lang, you wanna
show off your arm?

01:14.077 --> 01:17.069
-Amaze and astound your friends?
-Sure, why not?

01:18.615 --> 01:20.742
I'll let you in on a little secret too.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.509
The game's rigged.

01:23.686 --> 01:27.782
Magnets. Just get it close,
I'll slip you a prize.

01:27.957 --> 01:32.155
-Won't you get in trouble for that?
-No, it's the last day of the fair.

01:32.328 --> 01:34.159
What are they gonna do?

01:36.266 --> 01:37.995
I rest my case.

01:38.168 --> 01:39.829
Seth is my lab partner.

01:40.003 --> 01:42.904
Yeah, and he's also had
a crush on you for forever.

01:43.072 --> 01:47.008
Isn't he the one who used to
spell your name out with spaghetti?

01:47.177 --> 01:53.047
That was in sixth grade. Now he's into,
like, cars, comics and GameCubes.

01:53.216 --> 01:55.116
What exactly do we have in common?

01:55.285 --> 01:56.547
I don't know.

01:58.955 --> 02:00.752
He's cute, though.

02:01.558 --> 02:03.822
Why not?
Expand your horizons.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.483
-Go for it.
-All right.

02:15.605 --> 02:18.096
-Aim. Aim.
-I am aiming!

02:20.109 --> 02:21.633
I give up.

02:22.145 --> 02:23.976
Here.

02:25.281 --> 02:27.181
For a fine effort.

02:28.384 --> 02:29.976
Oh, Seth, l....

02:30.353 --> 02:31.786
You don't like it?

02:33.823 --> 02:37.987
-I'll take it.
-I'm sorry, sir, but you have to win first.

02:38.161 --> 02:39.856
Oh, yeah? Like her?

02:43.266 --> 02:45.393
I think you should...should leave.

02:46.536 --> 02:48.163
Yeah?

02:48.504 --> 02:50.131
I'd like to see you make me.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.768
Here, just take it and leave him alone.

02:53.943 --> 02:56.434
You gonna let your chick
do your fighting for you?

02:56.846 --> 02:59.314
Come on, punk.
What you got?

03:04.087 --> 03:05.918
I'm gonna tear you apart!

03:06.089 --> 03:07.420
Get security.

03:38.855 --> 03:41.255
Seth, oh, my God.
Someone call an ambulance!

03:43.293 --> 03:44.954
Seth?

03:49.966 --> 03:53.299
Okay, Seth, just relax,
and try not to move.

03:53.469 --> 03:55.596
I'm feeling a little
claustrophobic in here.

03:55.772 --> 03:58.900
That's completely normal.
I'm about to turn on the MRI.

03:59.075 --> 04:02.511
You're gonna hear some noises,
and we'll be done before you know it.

04:02.979 --> 04:05.709
What' s that? What' s happening?
Is that normal?

04:05.882 --> 04:09.909
It's just the magnetic field being
activated. Nothing to worry about.

04:13.756 --> 04:16.656
Help! Help!

04:18.027 --> 04:19.289
Hold on!

04:33.242 --> 04:34.903
I need a nurse in here now!

04:40.350 --> 04:41.612
Relax.

04:42.752 --> 04:45.050
I need some help in here!
Stat!

04:47.857 --> 04:50.951
Seth, what happened?
Are you okay?

05:00.069 --> 05:01.400
Chloe was right.

05:04.407 --> 05:06.272
You really are cute.

06:02.265 --> 06:04.256
TB records?

06:04.434 --> 06:05.867
I'm a little confused.

06:06.035 --> 06:09.596
I asked you to look into the tenement
fire that killed my grandparents...

06:09.772 --> 06:13.230
...and you brought me the history of
my father's childhood inoculations.

06:13.876 --> 06:15.434
Hey, these things take time.

06:15.611 --> 06:17.772
Especially when you're
billing by the hour.

06:17.947 --> 06:20.507
Yeah, well, the information I pulled...

06:20.917 --> 06:23.385
...it's not the records that are important.

06:23.586 --> 06:26.350
It's the list of the individuals
who've accessed them.

06:26.522 --> 06:30.925
Turns out I'm not the only one
looking into the Luthor family history.

07:05.294 --> 07:06.852
Hey.

07:08.564 --> 07:12.159
Either you're really excited about your
Jell-O, or you're feeling better.

07:12.335 --> 07:14.166
I feel great, actually.

07:14.337 --> 07:17.431
-Yeah, your cut looks amazing.
-Yeah.

07:18.141 --> 07:21.167
You should see the MRl machine.
It's a TKO.

07:21.444 --> 07:23.344
Yeah, do they know what happened?

07:23.546 --> 07:26.606
I guess something interfered
with the magnetic field.

07:26.782 --> 07:29.376
Must've just been
an old machine, I guess.

07:30.753 --> 07:34.382
Sorry for ruining your day at the fair.
Thanks for bringing me to the hospital.

07:34.557 --> 07:36.218
I was happy to help.

07:41.063 --> 07:43.827
You know,
I'd really like to make it up to you.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.764
Maybe take you out sometime?

07:48.638 --> 07:50.697
Seth, you don't have to.

08:01.117 --> 08:02.744
Well, okay.

08:02.919 --> 08:04.750
How about tonight?

08:13.496 --> 08:15.361
Clark, what's the rush?

08:15.765 --> 08:18.029
You're not upset that Seth
asked me out, are you?

08:18.201 --> 08:20.135
No. It's great.

08:20.303 --> 08:26.264
I'm glad you think so. Because last time
I checked, you and I were just friends.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.371
Lana, it's fine.
Really, it's no problem.

08:35.885 --> 08:38.318
I just....
I gotta go.

09:05.448 --> 09:07.245
-Hello, sweetheart.
-Hi, baby.

09:08.084 --> 09:12.145
Something must be wrong if he
didn't eat the last piece of cherry pie.

09:13.222 --> 09:14.849
It's nothing.

09:15.024 --> 09:16.582
It's just Lana.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.385
Seth Nelson asked her out.

09:19.729 --> 09:20.991
What did she say?

09:22.398 --> 09:25.026
She said yes so fast,
it gave me whiplash.

09:26.068 --> 09:29.367
Look, Clark, jealousy is a tough emotion.

09:29.538 --> 09:30.800
Dad, I'm not jealous.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.739
Maybe a little bit...

09:34.910 --> 09:37.435
...but he asked her out
on a date right in front of me.

09:37.613 --> 09:40.377
I just find it
hard to believe she'd say yes.

09:41.550 --> 09:45.111
Clark, you made a really tough
decision, son.

09:45.621 --> 09:49.955
You didn't want to endanger Lana,
but you can't have it both ways.

09:50.126 --> 09:52.117
If you're not willing
to go out with Lana...

09:52.295 --> 09:55.321
...she's perfectly free
to go out with whoever she wants.

09:56.299 --> 09:58.733
I guess you have to accept it.

10:04.006 --> 10:05.906
I didn't think you were gonna show.

10:06.075 --> 10:09.909
Not that Clark Kent ever operates on
the same speed as the rest of the world.

10:10.079 --> 10:13.105
-lnteresting observation, Chloe.
-Hey, Lex.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.648
Clark's not here.
Obviously.

10:15.818 --> 10:17.410
Actually, I was looking for you.

10:20.556 --> 10:24.048
It's come to my attention that
you've been checking into my father.

10:25.695 --> 10:28.459
I saw your name on the
Metropolis County Records log.

10:28.631 --> 10:33.159
Oh, yeah, that. I'm just writing
a story on him for the Torch.

10:33.336 --> 10:38.330
Oh, really? A story that involves
obscure childhood medical records?

10:38.507 --> 10:42.238
-Just trying to be thorough.
-The mark of a good reporter.

10:42.845 --> 10:44.745
And you are a good reporter, Chloe.

10:47.183 --> 10:49.344
So good
that my father pulled strings...

10:49.518 --> 10:52.919
...to make you the youngest columnist
in the history of the Daily Planet.

10:53.089 --> 10:54.386
What do you want, Lex?

10:54.557 --> 10:56.047
I'm just curious.

10:56.225 --> 11:00.685
Wondering why a high school reporter is
digging so deeply into my father's past.

11:03.899 --> 11:06.561
Maybe I'll just ask him
about it at dinner tonight.

11:06.736 --> 11:09.204
Go ahead, since the only way
you could've found out...

11:09.372 --> 11:12.068
...about those records
is if you looked into them yourself.

11:12.241 --> 11:14.903
At least I'm prepared
for what I might find.

11:15.244 --> 11:18.611
I'm not so sure you realize
what you've gotten yourself into.

11:40.336 --> 11:41.701
Lana.

11:44.907 --> 11:47.341
I owe you an apology.

11:47.510 --> 11:49.671
It did bother me
when Seth asked you out.

11:52.548 --> 11:56.985
But I have to get used to the idea that
you're gonna be dating other people.

12:00.156 --> 12:05.059
I'm sorry too, Clark. I didn't mean
for that to happen right in front of you.

12:06.362 --> 12:11.095
Truthfully, I don't even know why
I agreed to go out with Seth.

12:12.301 --> 12:15.668
Maybe I was just subconsciously
trying to make you jealous.

12:18.908 --> 12:21.001
So you're not really into him.

12:22.812 --> 12:25.542
He's a nice enough guy, it's just....

12:26.816 --> 12:28.875
There aren't any sparks.

12:30.486 --> 12:33.011
He's gonna be here any second
to pick me up.

12:37.026 --> 12:38.823
Lana, I know I should stay out of it...

12:38.994 --> 12:43.021
...but if you don't feel that way
about Seth, it's not right to lead him on.

12:43.466 --> 12:44.831
Lana?

12:46.602 --> 12:50.368
-Hey. Ready to go?
-Seth, hi.

12:55.244 --> 12:57.178
Maybe we should sit down.

12:59.315 --> 13:00.612
Yeah.

13:07.323 --> 13:09.223
I don't know how to say this.

13:11.026 --> 13:13.654
I know I said I could go with you...

13:13.929 --> 13:15.692
...but I can't.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.697
I really am sorry.

13:21.103 --> 13:22.764
It's no problem.

13:23.772 --> 13:26.138
It's just that
you're always so busy, you know?

13:28.043 --> 13:30.739
You owe it to yourself to take a break...

13:32.081 --> 13:33.605
...have a little bit of fun.

13:36.151 --> 13:39.416
You know what?
You're right.

13:39.588 --> 13:41.749
I'd love to go out with you.

13:42.791 --> 13:44.656
-Could you cover me?
-Sure, no problem.

13:56.372 --> 13:59.398
Seth, what are we doing here?
The fair's closed for the season.

13:59.575 --> 14:02.772
It is, but they don't take the rides away
for a few more days.

14:02.945 --> 14:04.776
And how are we supposed to get in?

14:06.448 --> 14:07.915
Turn around. It's a surprise.

14:20.996 --> 14:22.554
How did you do that?

14:23.799 --> 14:26.597
I guess the no-peeking rule
wasn't really clear.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.737
Can you keep a big secret?

14:29.605 --> 14:31.129
What do you mean?

14:31.974 --> 14:34.807
You know after that guy hit me
and I went to the hospital?

14:34.977 --> 14:37.241
I all of a sudden
got these strange powers.

14:37.413 --> 14:40.314
It's like I could warp
an electromagnetic field.

14:42.518 --> 14:47.251
After the MRl I could move metal objects
like a magnet.

14:47.423 --> 14:48.788
Can you do it all the time?

14:52.261 --> 14:54.491
Only when I concentrate.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.527
Am I scaring you?

14:58.634 --> 15:01.626
Maybe in the past you would be...

15:03.072 --> 15:05.563
...but actually, I think it's kind of cool.

15:07.309 --> 15:09.573
Thanks for not thinking I'm a freak.

15:09.745 --> 15:11.713
Thanks for being honest with me.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.575
It really means a lot.

15:27.329 --> 15:28.819
You're amazing.

15:29.898 --> 15:31.456
Let's go.

15:46.248 --> 15:49.183
-I love this ride.
-Yeah, me too.

15:50.252 --> 15:53.779
Reminds me that there's a world
out there beyond Smallville.

15:53.956 --> 15:55.617
I'm gonna leave one day.

15:56.992 --> 15:59.085
I can't believe
you're here with me...

15:59.561 --> 16:02.962
...even though I've always thought
we've had a connection, you know?

16:21.350 --> 16:23.284
Yeah, me too.

16:24.653 --> 16:26.883
I never realized it was this strong.

16:35.597 --> 16:37.155
I'm sorry.

16:39.468 --> 16:42.096
I'm moving too fast.
I'll stop.

16:44.707 --> 16:48.040
Oh, my God!
Seth, you're crazy.

16:53.282 --> 16:57.343
Seth, what's going on?
You're making me nauseous.

17:04.626 --> 17:06.924
Clark, what are you doing here?

17:07.096 --> 17:08.619
I heard screaming.

17:08.797 --> 17:10.958
I thought you were in trouble
so I pulled the switch.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.328
What switch?
I didn't hear the motor go off.

17:14.336 --> 17:17.099
Do you always come to the fair
when it's closed, Clark?

17:18.741 --> 17:20.538
Did you follow us here?

17:23.412 --> 17:25.107
Are you stalking me?

17:26.482 --> 17:28.540
Better find a new hobby, Clark.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.892
-You actually dated that loser?
-Yeah.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.802
Nice trick.

17:52.975 --> 17:55.808
Haven't you got anything better to do
than follow me around?

17:55.978 --> 17:58.640
You can control metal objects,
can't you, Seth?

17:58.814 --> 18:02.511
-So what if I can?
-And you've got some kind of hold on Lana.

18:03.018 --> 18:05.578
Hate to poke a hole
in your little theory, Clark.

18:05.754 --> 18:07.847
Lana's not made out of steel.

18:08.457 --> 18:12.154
I don't know how you're doing it, but l
won't let you force Lana to be with you.

18:12.327 --> 18:14.295
I'm not forcing her to do anything.

18:14.463 --> 18:18.900
I'm persuasive and she's on the rebound.
It's not my fault you blew it, Clark.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.898
She's not into you, Seth.

18:21.403 --> 18:23.166
Could've fooled me.

18:23.338 --> 18:25.636
Look, Lana's all I've ever
thought about, okay?

18:25.808 --> 18:27.673
And now she's mine, so deal with it.

18:27.843 --> 18:30.869
I'm warning you, Seth.
Stay away from Lana.

18:31.046 --> 18:33.879
And I'm warning you, leave us alone.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.044
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

18:53.502 --> 18:56.164
So you think that the
meteor flakes from the snow globe...

18:56.338 --> 18:59.102
...plus the MRl, equals Magnet Boy?

18:59.741 --> 19:03.336
Well, assuming we can prove that Seth
can manipulate metal with his mind...

19:03.512 --> 19:07.073
...what does that have to do with
Lana's sudden Seth infatuation?

19:07.249 --> 19:10.514
Her attraction to him
has something to do with the accident.

19:10.853 --> 19:13.549
Or Lana could just think he's really hot.

19:13.722 --> 19:17.852
Seriously. I know you don't want to
admit it, but it's possible she likes him.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.893
-Chloe, they have nothing in common--
-What are you doing?

19:21.063 --> 19:23.554
He's been around,
but they barely know each other.

19:25.701 --> 19:29.603
Well, except for the past two years,
you could be describing yourself.

19:29.771 --> 19:31.136
I found it.

19:35.344 --> 19:36.709
Look at this.

19:36.879 --> 19:40.144
The electromagnetic activity in Seth
is higher after the MRl.

19:40.315 --> 19:43.250
Well, that explains
the walking magnet theory.

19:43.418 --> 19:45.045
Why didn't the doctors flag it?

19:45.220 --> 19:47.745
According to this,
they chalked it up to an accident.

19:47.923 --> 19:50.517
They're gonna keep an eye on him
for a few weeks.

19:50.692 --> 19:52.250
Let's head back to the Torch...

19:52.427 --> 19:56.124
...so we can check up on the effects
of electromagnetism in the body.

20:02.271 --> 20:03.670
What's going on?

20:04.239 --> 20:05.968
What are you two doing in here?

20:10.379 --> 20:11.812
Nothing.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.982
Sorry, we were just taking a break
from candy-striping.

20:16.151 --> 20:18.312
This is a hospital, young lady.

20:18.487 --> 20:20.455
Volunteering is about helping patients...

20:20.622 --> 20:23.455
...not about makeout sessions
in the file room, okay?

20:23.625 --> 20:25.058
Okay.

20:27.863 --> 20:30.127
A good reporter
always thinks on her feet.

20:44.379 --> 20:45.641
Lana.

20:48.450 --> 20:51.749
I heard you warned Seth
to stay away from me.

20:52.421 --> 20:55.322
First you follow us
to the fair, and now this?

20:55.490 --> 20:58.982
-Who do you think you are, Clark?
-Lana, I had to.

20:59.161 --> 21:02.392
Seth is different.
He was affected by the MRl.

21:02.931 --> 21:06.059
-lt somehow made him magnetic.
-I know that, Clark.

21:07.169 --> 21:08.534
Seth showed me.

21:08.704 --> 21:12.196
He's been completely honest
about his abilities.

21:12.374 --> 21:14.467
And I think it's great.

21:16.979 --> 21:18.674
Well, it's not just metal.

21:18.947 --> 21:22.007
He's affecting you too. He's using
his powers to make you like him.

21:22.184 --> 21:23.446
Don't be ridiculous.

21:23.618 --> 21:27.418
Your brain is like a circuit board of
magnetic impulses, and Chloe and l--

21:27.589 --> 21:29.887
You talked to Chloe about this?

21:30.058 --> 21:31.923
It's like he's a giant magnet.

21:32.094 --> 21:33.994
And he's able to control
those impulses...

21:34.162 --> 21:37.723
...make your brain secrete the
chemicals that control your emotions.

21:37.899 --> 21:39.833
That's crazy.

21:40.102 --> 21:43.936
Lana, the brain releases chemicals
that control depression and hunger.

21:44.106 --> 21:47.769
-Why not attraction?
-Seth isn't touching me now.

21:48.076 --> 21:52.069
But I'm beginning to care more about
him than I have for any other guy.

21:52.247 --> 21:53.805
Ever.

21:55.083 --> 21:58.484
-So how do you explain that?
-I don't know.

21:59.421 --> 22:01.082
Maybe it's like metal.

22:01.256 --> 22:04.282
The longer a magnet touches metal,
the longer the effects last.

22:04.459 --> 22:07.519
Look, Clark. If you don't wanna
date me, that's fine.

22:07.696 --> 22:09.755
But to make up some crazy theory
so I don't--

22:09.931 --> 22:11.592
Lana, that's not it.

22:11.767 --> 22:17.137
I came here to tell you that
who I date is none of your business.

22:18.273 --> 22:21.709
-Lana, Seth is dangerous.
-No, Clark, you are.

22:23.545 --> 22:26.673
We're not together anymore,
and that was your choice.

22:28.150 --> 22:29.640
So let me go.

22:52.474 --> 22:53.839
Great.

22:57.879 --> 22:59.506
Evening.

23:06.521 --> 23:08.216
Go ahead, call the cops.

23:08.390 --> 23:10.358
The first question
they're gonna ask is...

23:10.525 --> 23:14.359
...why would a person like me
break into a high school newspaper?

23:15.530 --> 23:17.657
Whatever could I be looking for?

23:17.966 --> 23:20.298
Who are you?
What do you want?

23:20.469 --> 23:24.565
I'm working for someone who's
interested in the same thing you are.

23:25.474 --> 23:27.635
Which Luthor sent you?

23:29.744 --> 23:32.611
Why would you jump
to that conclusion, Chloe?

23:33.715 --> 23:36.047
Wait. What do you think you're doing?

23:36.785 --> 23:39.686
Something I doubt that you'll
want to tell the police about.

23:42.991 --> 23:44.458
You have a nice night.

23:59.374 --> 24:01.569
I gotta say, I like the new Lana.

24:01.743 --> 24:05.110
I took your advice and
splurged on a whole new wardrobe.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.305
I can't wait to see the rest later.

24:07.482 --> 24:09.780
I could do a fashion show.

24:16.892 --> 24:20.555
You know how you said you wanted
to get out of Smallville someday?

24:22.764 --> 24:24.026
Why not today?

24:26.101 --> 24:28.035
Are you serious?

24:32.541 --> 24:34.736
Where do you wanna go?

24:34.910 --> 24:37.970
I don't know. I figured we'd just
see where the road takes us.

24:38.413 --> 24:39.846
What do you say?

24:44.252 --> 24:46.584
I'd go anywhere with you.

24:52.127 --> 24:56.063
You know we're probably
gonna need some money.

25:00.435 --> 25:02.369
I think I've got that covered.

25:03.138 --> 25:04.662
Right.

25:11.479 --> 25:14.107
Meet me out back.
I've got a surprise for you, okay?

25:23.091 --> 25:25.787
What are you doing, cleaning us out?

25:26.528 --> 25:28.894
Taking an advance
on my share of the profits.

25:29.531 --> 25:32.261
Okay, joke's over.
Put the money back.

25:32.434 --> 25:37.133
I'm not joking, Lex. I need the cash.
Seth and I are leaving Smallville.

25:41.710 --> 25:43.541
Lana, you can't be serious.

25:43.712 --> 25:47.239
I can't stay in Smallville
for a coffee shop, Lex.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.747
Try and understand,
my whole family's gone.

25:49.918 --> 25:52.113
My friends have changed.

25:52.287 --> 25:56.121
I found someone who really wants
to be with me, who trusts me.

25:56.558 --> 25:59.584
For the first time in a long time,
I don't feel like I'm alone.

26:06.935 --> 26:08.698
Hop in.

26:10.205 --> 26:12.469
Pretty sweet ride for a 1 6-year-old.

26:15.076 --> 26:18.239
Lana, you're making a serious mistake.

26:19.047 --> 26:20.776
Have a nice life, Lex.

26:22.183 --> 26:23.582
Let's go.

26:34.963 --> 26:36.555
Where's Lana?

26:36.731 --> 26:38.858
Leaving town with her new boyfriend.

26:40.335 --> 26:42.565
She just cleared out the register.

26:43.004 --> 26:47.031
Don't worry, I'm calling the sheriff.
They won't even make it out of town.

27:17.605 --> 27:20.267
What happened?
What's wrong?

27:23.144 --> 27:24.611
We're stuck.

27:32.087 --> 27:34.783
Look at this.
It's like the road melted.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.082
I can't believe this.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.552
Oh, my God.

27:41.329 --> 27:42.887
Seth, it's the sheriff.

27:47.135 --> 27:48.693
What are we gonna do?

27:54.409 --> 27:57.742
Don't worry, okay?
We're gonna be together.

27:59.013 --> 28:00.275
Trust me.

28:18.299 --> 28:22.201
Lana Lang, remain in the vehicle
and put your hands on the dashboard.

28:26.908 --> 28:29.001
Clark, you were right.

28:29.177 --> 28:31.907
-I didn't believe you before, but now....
-It's okay.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.048
We all make mistakes, believe me.

28:34.616 --> 28:37.016
Sheriff Adams knows
that you didn't steal the car...

28:37.185 --> 28:39.745
...and Lex has a lawyer
working on the other charges.

28:41.656 --> 28:43.283
I was so mean to you.

28:44.225 --> 28:46.250
You still didn't give up on me.

28:49.798 --> 28:52.460
Do you have any idea where Seth went?

28:54.035 --> 28:58.438
Well, he's got a brother
in Grandville, works at a diner.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.506
We were gonna stay with him.

29:04.679 --> 29:06.237
Clark.

29:14.789 --> 29:16.279
Thank you.

29:30.905 --> 29:33.567
You're a Luthor, so it's a given
that you're unscrupulous.

29:33.741 --> 29:36.801
But I really thought
petty larceny was beneath you, Lex.

29:36.978 --> 29:39.344
Can you be a little more
specific with the charge?

29:39.514 --> 29:43.075
I caught some creep in my office,
trying to steal one of my computers.

29:43.251 --> 29:46.311
I figured either you
or your father hired him.

29:46.488 --> 29:47.921
But you're accusing me.

29:48.089 --> 29:51.388
You're what they euphemistically
call "the lesser of two evils."

29:51.726 --> 29:54.991
I admire your take-charge attitude.

29:55.163 --> 29:58.496
Barging in here
and accusing me took guts.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.266
Or sheer stupidity.

30:01.903 --> 30:05.999
What do you say
we pay a visit to your intruder?

30:10.345 --> 30:11.937
How did he die?

30:13.648 --> 30:15.479
Natural causes.

30:15.650 --> 30:18.710
-Apparently, his heart just gave out.
-You believe that?

30:18.887 --> 30:20.411
Given what he was looking into...

30:20.588 --> 30:23.148
...I doubt there was anything
natural about his death.

30:23.892 --> 30:26.554
How do I know you're not
just playing me, Lex?

30:28.229 --> 30:30.561
You're right, Chloe.
I could be.

30:31.065 --> 30:34.796
I often bring high school girls to the
morgue to show them what happens...

30:34.969 --> 30:37.802
...when trained professionals
cross my father.

30:38.339 --> 30:40.739
Well, there's nothing
in my files worth killing for.

30:40.909 --> 30:43.605
We've got a corpse here
that says you're wrong.

30:46.114 --> 30:48.912
Chloe, you're involved
in a very dangerous game.

30:51.486 --> 30:53.351
I can protect you.

30:54.122 --> 30:56.716
Yeah, like you protected him?

31:00.862 --> 31:03.592
Mason knew the risks
of tangling with my father.

31:05.366 --> 31:06.890
You clearly don't.

31:08.036 --> 31:10.163
I'm the only choice you've got.

31:27.655 --> 31:31.284
Hey! What are you doing in here?
You're not supposed to--!

31:37.131 --> 31:38.598
Seth.

31:40.535 --> 31:42.332
I'm so happy you're here.

31:42.670 --> 31:46.731
Really? I just saw Clark leave, and I thought
you were having second thoughts.

31:46.908 --> 31:48.739
Clark's my past.
You're my future.

31:48.910 --> 31:52.141
I made up a story, told him
that you were headed to Grandville.

31:52.313 --> 31:54.008
Put your hands in the air.

32:03.758 --> 32:05.089
Go on.

32:10.231 --> 32:12.290
Seth doesn't have
a brother in Grandville.

32:12.467 --> 32:14.697
Lana was trying
to throw me off his trail.

32:14.869 --> 32:17.269
She lied to me, right to my face,
and I believed her.

32:17.438 --> 32:20.202
She's clearly not herself, Clark.

32:20.375 --> 32:22.775
I know. I'm not angry.

32:23.645 --> 32:26.045
I realize that that's what
I've been doing to her.

32:26.214 --> 32:29.206
Your feelings
for Lana are not a lie.

32:29.384 --> 32:31.852
You think I made the right decision,
pushing her away?

32:32.086 --> 32:33.713
I don't know.

32:35.690 --> 32:37.954
I miss the days when your answers
were yes and no.

32:38.126 --> 32:40.026
Me too.

32:41.195 --> 32:44.221
Hey, Seth pulled a Bonnie and Clyde
and broke Lana out of jail.

32:44.399 --> 32:46.924
-What?
-Sheriff's got all the roads blocked.

32:47.101 --> 32:49.092
She's gonna ruin her life
being with him.

32:49.270 --> 32:51.465
-I gotta find them.
-Clark, they could be hiding anywhere.

32:51.639 --> 32:53.607
They're a needle in a haystack.

32:56.744 --> 32:58.075
Depends on the needle.

33:23.371 --> 33:25.271
I can't believe you came back for me.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.873
You could've been caught.

33:27.041 --> 33:29.532
I'd never leave
Smallville without you.

33:29.711 --> 33:31.872
-You're all I've ever wanted.
-Let's go now...

33:32.046 --> 33:33.980
...and get out of here,
just the two of us.

33:34.148 --> 33:36.946
No, not yet.
It's too dangerous.

33:37.118 --> 33:39.018
They take the rides
out tomorrow morning.

33:39.187 --> 33:41.246
We'll slip away on one of the trucks.

33:42.356 --> 33:43.983
Come here.

33:55.002 --> 33:56.902
You're not taking her anywhere.

33:58.506 --> 34:00.064
I told you to stay away from her.

34:00.241 --> 34:01.833
Clark.

34:03.711 --> 34:05.440
Let him go.

34:12.987 --> 34:15.080
Let him go, Clark,
or I swear, I'll shoot.

34:18.391 --> 34:20.518
Get away from him, Clark!

34:26.000 --> 34:28.594
Lana, I can handle it from here.

34:35.576 --> 34:38.136
Just go. Just meet me outside, okay?

34:53.860 --> 34:55.158
You need help, Seth.

34:55.329 --> 34:58.127
No, you're just saying that
because you want Lana back.

34:58.299 --> 34:59.994
But you can't have her.

35:09.777 --> 35:12.405
Looks like I'm not
the only one with special powers.

35:30.464 --> 35:33.024
Clark, you can't fight physics.

35:38.472 --> 35:40.269
Neither can you.

36:11.806 --> 36:13.501
Nice outfit.

36:15.209 --> 36:17.507
It goes with the community service.

36:17.845 --> 36:21.337
Which is getting off easy,
after what I did.

36:24.919 --> 36:26.443
Lex, thanks for all your help.

36:28.022 --> 36:31.082
What good are lawyers
if they can't jump through hoops?

36:32.393 --> 36:34.623
Any word on your friend Seth?

36:34.795 --> 36:36.126
He's still in a coma.

36:36.297 --> 36:39.960
They don't know what he'll remember
if and when he ever wakes up.

36:41.435 --> 36:43.369
Lex, I'm sorry I let you down.

36:45.306 --> 36:49.800
I can't defend my behavior,
magnetism or no magnetism.

36:50.278 --> 36:52.405
But I'd really like
my job at the Talon back.

36:52.580 --> 36:54.172
Done.

36:54.916 --> 36:56.474
I'm serious.
The place needs you.

36:56.651 --> 36:59.085
And I make a lousy latte.

37:01.789 --> 37:03.051
-Lex--
-Lana...

37:03.224 --> 37:06.557
...I did a lot worse things than
steal a sports car when I was your age.

37:06.727 --> 37:10.823
And I'm the last guy to criticize someone
for falling for the wrong person.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.761
But I'm sure the right guy is out there.

37:29.383 --> 37:30.645
Lex.

37:34.322 --> 37:38.224
I was thinking about what you said,
and I need your help.

37:49.804 --> 37:52.967
All right, Chloe, you have the floor.

37:55.076 --> 37:57.442
It all started with the Wall of Weird.

37:57.611 --> 38:00.603
Your dad was interested
in the effects of the meteor rocks.

38:00.781 --> 38:06.981
He wanted me to start feeding him
information about the more bizarre incidents.

38:12.126 --> 38:14.321
It's always been an obsession of his.

38:16.664 --> 38:19.758
But I can't imagine that's
the extent of your arrangement.

38:21.035 --> 38:23.629
He wanted me to spy on a friend.

38:25.873 --> 38:27.602
Who?

38:27.775 --> 38:29.572
It doesn't matter.

38:35.716 --> 38:37.343
Clark.

38:39.787 --> 38:42.347
-And did you?
-Of course not.

38:42.523 --> 38:44.423
I would never do that.
Clark is my friend.

38:44.592 --> 38:48.858
And I told him that,
but then he threatened to fire my dad.

38:51.165 --> 38:54.134
So I figured that in order to
get out of my agreement with him...

38:54.301 --> 38:56.269
...I had to find something on your father.

38:56.437 --> 39:00.464
You know, something damaging enough
so that I could blackmail Lionel Luthor.

39:04.278 --> 39:06.974
That was a very dangerous decision.

39:07.548 --> 39:08.845
I know.

39:13.421 --> 39:15.286
I'll protect you, Chloe.

39:16.657 --> 39:18.682
You have my word.

39:19.493 --> 39:23.725
But in order to do that, I need to know
what you found out about my father.

39:26.667 --> 39:29.295
Have you ever heard
of a man named Morgan Edge?

39:31.872 --> 39:35.364
Before he was killed, he was
the biggest crime lord in Metropolis.

39:40.014 --> 39:43.450
He was also your father's
closest childhood friend.

39:58.966 --> 40:00.263
Lana.

40:01.402 --> 40:05.600
I came by to say thank you
for saving me from Seth.

40:06.373 --> 40:07.897
And to apologize.

40:08.542 --> 40:10.476
For real this time.

40:11.712 --> 40:14.340
I should've believed you, Clark.
I'm sorry.

40:15.716 --> 40:17.707
You weren't acting
of your own free will.

40:17.885 --> 40:19.147
Maybe.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.880
But even though
I was under Seth's influence...

40:22.056 --> 40:24.854
...part of me always
knew you were right.

40:25.059 --> 40:27.994
I just kept telling myself
that you were jealous.

40:28.762 --> 40:31.560
I guess that's just the way
I wanted you to feel.

40:37.438 --> 40:40.669
It wasn't easy for me
to see you with another guy.

40:45.746 --> 40:49.512
Are you still sure
you don't want to be that guy?

40:50.985 --> 40:52.680
Lana....

40:53.020 --> 40:57.684
It's all right. I just wanted to
make sure before I told you this.

41:01.428 --> 41:06.627
Even though my compass
was way off with Seth...

41:09.069 --> 41:12.300
...he still had the courage
to be honest with me.

41:12.740 --> 41:15.106
Then he used his abilities
to manipulate you.

41:15.276 --> 41:18.109
I am not condoning what he did.

41:18.279 --> 41:20.509
Believe me, I'm paying for it.

41:24.218 --> 41:28.052
It still felt good caring for someone...

41:28.222 --> 41:30.747
...and having my feelings returned.

41:32.793 --> 41:34.818
I want that again.

41:38.098 --> 41:40.396
I don't expect you
to wait forever for me.

41:40.568 --> 41:42.468
Good.

41:42.636 --> 41:46.697
Because one of these days, someone's
gonna come along that's right for me.

41:47.308 --> 41:50.937
And I'm going to
want to be with that person.

41:53.714 --> 41:56.080
And you're gonna
have to deal with that.
