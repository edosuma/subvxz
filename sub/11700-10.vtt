00:02.360 --> 00:04.395
Tucker: Hey! Hey, little help?

00:04.430 --> 00:07.164
Hey, the bathroom door is stuck again, guys!

00:07.200 --> 00:08.265
Ben: Emma?

00:08.301 --> 00:10.201
People, we got a runner.

00:10.236 --> 00:11.318
A pint-sized runner.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.937
Oh, there you are!

00:12.972 --> 00:14.972
- Hey.
- Hi!

00:15.024 --> 00:18.008
Dude, last night she climbed out
of her crib for the first time,

00:18.060 --> 00:20.611
and then gave me a
"what are you gonna do about it?" Look.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.946
What am I gonna do about it?

00:21.981 --> 00:23.447
(Banging continues)

00:23.482 --> 00:24.598
Tucker: Hey, is somebody out there?

00:24.650 --> 00:27.418
He baby-proofed the door
backwards and wrong.

00:27.453 --> 00:28.719
So, Tucker's in and can't get out.

00:28.771 --> 00:32.122
I would help him,
but I'm very busy enjoying this breakfast.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.324
Hey, speaking of breakfast,

00:33.359 --> 00:36.894
hey, do we have any non...

00:36.946 --> 00:38.996
okay. You know what?

00:39.031 --> 00:42.933
If this is another takeout menu from
the Chinese place, we will have words.

00:43.920 --> 00:44.869
It's a note.

00:46.706 --> 00:48.539
"Hear ye, hear ye, listen close,

00:48.574 --> 00:50.774
"in just one day, a birthday toast.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.643
"It's Bonnie Wheeler's special day,

00:52.678 --> 00:54.578
"so whoop it up, or you'll all pay.

00:54.630 --> 00:57.181
"Signed, anonymous."

00:57.216 --> 00:59.216
Man, I really thought it was from mom.

00:59.252 --> 01:01.185
Dude, oh my God!

01:01.220 --> 01:03.938
I promised mom a birthday party!
You know what this means?

01:03.990 --> 01:05.589
You have some things to plan?

01:05.625 --> 01:08.826
Yeah. Like, where to rent a getaway car,
or buy a ticket to anywhere but here.

01:08.828 --> 01:11.528
Emma? Emma? Where is she?

01:11.564 --> 01:13.380
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13.416 --> 01:14.865
Tucker: Good news.

01:14.901 --> 01:17.368
At least one person around here
knows how to open a baby-proof door.

01:17.403 --> 01:18.552
Give me high-five!

01:18.604 --> 01:19.637
Yeah!

01:31.751 --> 01:33.701
Okay people, we need invitations,

01:33.736 --> 01:36.353
decorations, food, music.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.573
And sadly, knowing my mom,
copious amounts of male nudity.

01:41.410 --> 01:43.327
Seriously,
when did this become so important?

01:43.379 --> 01:47.381
Last year, I had an away game,
so Ben was in charge of mom's birthday.

01:47.416 --> 01:49.249
It's a really long story.

01:53.306 --> 01:54.722
Oh, hey mom. What's going on?

01:54.757 --> 01:56.407
Oh, I don't know.

01:56.442 --> 01:59.643
Just sitting here about
to eat a whole sheet cake.

01:59.679 --> 02:01.178
Alone.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.397
For no reason whatsoever.

02:03.432 --> 02:05.182
Cool. Then can you watch Emma?

02:05.234 --> 02:06.600
I just got invited to this amazing party.

02:16.674 --> 02:18.926
So that's a no on watching Emma?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.283
I was sneezing sprinkles for a week.

02:24.437 --> 02:25.786
But look, the point is

02:25.838 --> 02:28.505
I felt so horrible, I promised I'd
throw her a giant bash this year.

02:28.541 --> 02:29.623
Exactly.

02:29.675 --> 02:30.674
You felt horrible.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.544
You said that you'd throw her a giant bash.

02:33.546 --> 02:35.379
Sounds like a "you" problem.

02:36.716 --> 02:38.432
If I could sneeze sprinkles?

02:38.467 --> 02:39.550
Never leave the house.

02:41.721 --> 02:43.554
Guys, come on!

02:43.606 --> 02:44.688
I have to do inventory at the bar,

02:44.724 --> 02:46.557
but Danny will do most of the heavy lifting.

02:46.609 --> 02:49.393
Why? There's nowhere for me to go but down.

02:49.428 --> 02:50.527
I'm already the good son.

02:51.897 --> 02:54.398
Look, can't you guys just put
together some kind of video tribute?

02:54.450 --> 02:58.369
You know, something that really captures
what a warm and loving person she is.

02:58.404 --> 03:01.538
Okay, suck-wads!

03:01.574 --> 03:04.408
I'm gonna skip the benefit
and go right to the doubt.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.585
You guys haven't done Jack for my birthday,
have you?

03:06.587 --> 03:08.337
- Huh?
- Wha...

03:08.389 --> 03:11.223
mom, calm down!
We're working on something...

03:11.258 --> 03:13.592
Big... and important...

03:13.644 --> 03:15.561
And surprisey.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.564
You are throwing me a surprise party?

03:18.599 --> 03:22.434
Oh my God, you are just the best son ever!

03:22.486 --> 03:24.503
Why can't you be more like your brother?

03:26.273 --> 03:28.607
You know what?
Okay, I have to go practice my surprise face.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.446
Yeah, you know what?
I gotta work on it. I'll work on it.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.585
She should be practicing her
"I'm so disappointed in you" face.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.420
Yeah. What's that one look like?

03:41.455 --> 03:43.288
I don't know. I've never seen it.

03:44.759 --> 03:47.326
I see it every day.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.294
Every day.

03:52.516 --> 03:53.715
Okay, lighting is good.

03:53.768 --> 03:56.301
Oh,
and if you could favor this side of my face,

03:56.353 --> 03:57.603
I'd really appreciate it.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.438
It's the better half of perfection.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.672
(Laughing)

04:00.708 --> 04:03.175
Oh, and since I work in TV,
let me give you a quick lesson.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.210
I point the phone at you and hit record?

04:05.246 --> 04:07.179
Yeah. I think I got it.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.798
Right. Hold on.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.850
Here you go, sweetie. Don't move, okay?

04:11.902 --> 04:14.603
All right. Mrs. Wheeler's birthday video.

04:14.638 --> 04:15.604
Take one.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.589
In three, two...

04:17.641 --> 04:21.627
Mrs. Wheeler, what can I say?

04:21.661 --> 04:24.530
Just, that I know in my heart

04:24.565 --> 04:26.265
that you steal from us.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.369
And I love how you think that you
can just boss everybody around.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.138
Tucker, this is supposed to be a tribute.

04:33.174 --> 04:35.974
Yeah, I know. But I've got a lot
of stuff to get off my chest.

04:36.010 --> 04:39.645
Well, just do what you did when I told
you Ben and I officially broke up.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.963
Right? Pretend to care.

04:41.015 --> 04:43.866
Oh, hey, how are you doing, anyway?

04:43.901 --> 04:46.552
Well, you know, things are getting better.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.454
Thank you so much for asking. I...

04:48.489 --> 04:50.506
- Oh, this is you pretending to care, isn't it?
- Ahh.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.427
All right.
Mrs. Wheeler's birthday video. Take two.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.462
Oh my God!

04:56.497 --> 04:57.496
Emma!

04:57.531 --> 04:58.964
Don't move!

04:58.999 --> 04:59.965
- (Gasps)
- (Clatter)

05:00.000 --> 05:01.216
(Baby crying)

05:03.070 --> 05:05.103
Stitches, Tucker, stitches!

05:05.139 --> 05:08.023
Are you happy now? We broke the baby.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.042
The doctor said she'll be fine.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.644
Yeah, but we won't once we tell Ben.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.613
For the last time,
will you please give me back my phone?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.614
I have to call him!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.015
Oh, hell no.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.452
No, you can't just blurt out, "sorry,
we accidentally maimed your baby."

05:20.488 --> 05:23.522
No, we have to find a window of opportunity.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.506
When he's calm.

05:24.558 --> 05:27.376
A window. Yeah, that's good.

05:27.411 --> 05:30.229
Yeah. We just have to make
sure that nobody finds out

05:30.231 --> 05:31.363
until we tell Ben ourselves.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.414
- (Door banging)
- (Screams)

05:32.466 --> 05:35.234
Bonnie: Hey! Let me out of here!

05:36.921 --> 05:38.270
- Oh, God.
- Mrs. Wheeler?

05:38.305 --> 05:40.906
You, uh...
You didn't hear anything, did you?

05:40.941 --> 05:43.725
I've heard nothing, I've seen nothing,

05:43.761 --> 05:46.028
which is starting to make me
think that there is nothing.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.614
What is Ben doing for my birthday?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.616
Lots. Tons. And you're gonna ruin it!

05:50.651 --> 05:52.718
So, get happy, get excited,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.520
but more importantly, get out.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.721
Okay, okay, I'm going!

05:55.756 --> 05:57.406
- God, I hope there's strippers.
- Yup.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.490
There's strippers, right?

05:58.526 --> 05:59.591
Right, now where were we?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.159
All right, we just need to find...

06:01.195 --> 06:02.110
- what up?
- Aah!

06:02.162 --> 06:03.295
Ben, hi, how's it going?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.297
We were just playing an
impromptu game of peekaboo.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.398
Both: Peekaboo!

06:06.450 --> 06:08.166
What's with the bear?

06:08.202 --> 06:10.269
Umm...

06:10.304 --> 06:13.038
Okay. All right, man.
Here's what happened, we were...

06:13.090 --> 06:14.940
We won it at a carnival!

06:14.975 --> 06:16.842
You were at a carnival?

06:16.877 --> 06:19.611
You're supposed to be helping,
not enjoying yourselves!

06:19.647 --> 06:20.646
You're so selfish!

06:20.681 --> 06:21.813
God, what about me?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.699
Okay, Ben. Here's what happened.

06:23.734 --> 06:26.518
You know,
I was pms-ing and craving a funnel cake.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.719
I mean, you know what happens,

06:27.771 --> 06:30.589
I just get bloated,
and I get so crampy and cranky...

06:30.624 --> 06:32.558
okay, I've heard enough. Thank you.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.359
Love you, Emma. Bye.

06:36.513 --> 06:37.429
What was that?

06:37.481 --> 06:39.231
Period card.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.882
Totally freaks guys out.

06:40.935 --> 06:42.267
No!

06:42.303 --> 06:43.919
That was our window!

06:43.954 --> 06:46.071
Oh, yeah.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.140
I can see now how that would have
been a good time to tell him.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.461
Ben: You know Danny,
I think we're doing okay.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.545
All right.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.514
I've got the flowers ordered.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.350
I've narrowed down the location
to her three favorite restaurants.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.302
And, I found a discount
version of the Chippendales.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.621
Two guys named chip and Dale.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.156
What's up with the music?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.425
Oh, well you know how you wanted a dj,
but I wanted a band?

07:06.460 --> 07:09.094
I found a guy named dj who's in a band!

07:09.129 --> 07:11.129
How are we with RSVP?

07:11.165 --> 07:12.497
How would I know?

07:12.533 --> 07:15.000
Because I said, "hey Danny,
how 'bout you handle mom's guests."

07:15.035 --> 07:17.803
I thought you said "handle mom's dress."

07:17.838 --> 07:20.973
None of the sales ladies would believe me
when I said I was trying them on for mom.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.609
Dude, nobody's coming to her party?

07:23.611 --> 07:24.710
What's the matter with you?

07:24.762 --> 07:27.346
Hey, don't get mad at me!
None of this is my fault.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.414
Oh really?
'Cause I'd say it was all your fault.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.650
If mom hadn't gone into labor
with you on her 18th birthday,

07:31.685 --> 07:34.586
dad probably never would have had to make
such a big deal out of it every year. God!

07:34.622 --> 07:36.555
Wait...

07:36.590 --> 07:39.291
My birthday's not for another two weeks.

07:39.326 --> 07:42.361
Pfft, you're right man. My bad.
You know how I am with dates.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.196
Hey, good call on the dj guy.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.799
Ben, what the hell is going on?

07:47.835 --> 07:50.802
Are you telling me I was
actually born on mom's birthday,

07:50.838 --> 07:52.938
and she's been lying to me my entire life,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.806
making up some random date

07:54.842 --> 07:58.410
so she could selfishly not
share her special day with me?

07:58.445 --> 08:01.580
Wow. I was gonna lie, but I'm kinda proud
you actually put it all together yourself.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.383
Oh my God!

08:04.418 --> 08:06.084
What does this mean?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.085
Who am I?

08:08.355 --> 08:09.388
Who are my real parents?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.191
Same people,

08:13.193 --> 08:15.761
just two weeks earlier.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.696
And you've known about this the entire time?

08:17.731 --> 08:18.914
Look, man, I'm sorry.

08:18.949 --> 08:20.165
I was sworn to secrecy

08:20.200 --> 08:22.901
when I found your birth certificate
folded inside mom's diary.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.587
Dude, she hated us.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.572
I can't believe she would do this to me!

08:27.608 --> 08:29.508
Danny! Danny! Wait, wait, wait!

08:29.543 --> 08:31.510
Any chance you can tell her Tucker told you?

08:31.545 --> 08:32.678
He runs faster than I do.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.414
Hey!

08:36.450 --> 08:39.501
I hope I'm not walking into any surprises!

08:39.535 --> 08:42.354
How could you lie to me about
when my real birthday is?

08:45.926 --> 08:47.059
Surprise.

08:56.444 --> 08:59.311
Okay. Coast looks clear. Let's move.

08:59.347 --> 09:02.148
Tucker, we can't keep hiding her.

09:02.183 --> 09:05.084
I mean, having a sleepover at my
place may have worked for one night,

09:05.119 --> 09:06.936
but we still have two days
until her stitches come out,

09:06.988 --> 09:08.254
and I can't keep living a lie!

09:08.289 --> 09:10.122
Get it together, Perrin!

09:10.158 --> 09:11.891
You cannot crack on me now!

09:11.893 --> 09:13.959
We have got to be as solid as a rock wall.

09:15.730 --> 09:16.846
Riley did it!

09:16.898 --> 09:19.832
You two get in here. Now!

09:19.884 --> 09:22.635
Oh God, she's on to us.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.773
I need your help with
Danny's surprise party.

09:27.809 --> 09:31.277
- (Both sighing)
- Oh. Is that it? Okay.

09:31.312 --> 09:33.479
So, he finally found out you've been
lying to him about his birthday?

09:33.481 --> 09:35.331
Ben told you, too?

09:35.383 --> 09:37.183
No. You did.

09:37.235 --> 09:39.168
It was that week you signed
up for a medical trial.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.086
Oh, right. Ugh.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.104
Oh my God.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.290
I am a horrible person.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.992
How could I do this to my own son?

09:47.028 --> 09:49.061
I mean, I really am the worst mother ever.

09:49.113 --> 09:51.931
Oh, no. That's not true.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.968
You're right.
I don't know why I'm so hard on myself.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.603
You know what would make me feel better?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.438
A hug from my little love bug!

09:59.474 --> 10:00.789
Hi! Okay. No...

10:00.842 --> 10:02.508
No, not you!

10:02.510 --> 10:04.443
Come here, sweetheart.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.345
No, what are you doing? Get off of me.

10:06.380 --> 10:07.480
- Here, come here.
- I'm back!

10:07.515 --> 10:10.249
Okay, stop. You wish. Okay, right?

10:10.284 --> 10:11.650
What is wrong with you people?

10:11.686 --> 10:13.419
Oh, just wanna put her down for a nap.

10:13.454 --> 10:15.271
You know, trying to be responsible. Bye.

10:17.124 --> 10:18.257
You know what?

10:18.292 --> 10:21.026
I need to find that video
of me giving birth to Danny.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.913
Yeah. Maybe a little guilt
will help smooth things over.

10:23.965 --> 10:25.865
Yeah, I just need to mute
the part where I screamed,

10:25.900 --> 10:28.767
"oh my God, it's a monster!"

10:31.005 --> 10:33.539
Can't you cancel the party you have booked?

10:33.574 --> 10:34.907
Just tell the kid his
birthday's in two weeks.

10:34.942 --> 10:37.610
That's what my mom did.

10:37.645 --> 10:38.661
Hello?

10:38.696 --> 10:40.412
(Groans)

10:40.448 --> 10:42.281
Hey, so, first of all,

10:42.316 --> 10:43.582
Happy Birthday,

10:43.618 --> 10:46.285
and second, you need to help me
find a venue for mom's party.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.520
Help you?

10:47.555 --> 10:50.055
Why should I help you?
I'm not even sure we're brothers.

10:50.091 --> 10:51.123
Mom could've lied about that, too.

10:51.158 --> 10:52.825
Danny, like...

10:54.845 --> 10:56.695
Okay, you've actually got a point.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.030
But,
you need to find a way to get over this.

10:58.082 --> 10:59.832
This isn't about you.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.933
Well, it is.

11:00.968 --> 11:03.702
Again, Happy Birthday,

11:03.738 --> 11:05.738
but, can we let it be about
you starting next year?

11:05.773 --> 11:08.340
I know if I found out that she lied to me,
I'd be cool.

11:08.342 --> 11:09.375
Oh, really?

11:09.410 --> 11:11.277
Mom thinks you're a horrible bartender,

11:11.312 --> 11:13.312
bribed your soccer coach
to put you on the team,

11:13.347 --> 11:16.081
and paid Ashley Jenkins
$50 to go to prom with you.

11:16.117 --> 11:18.984
Well, I definitely got $50 worth.

11:19.020 --> 11:22.388
Look, Danny,
I don't know why mom did what she did,

11:22.423 --> 11:25.291
and I promise from now on,
we will celebrate your birthday,

11:25.326 --> 11:27.860
but this year, I have to take care of mom.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.795
Why are you still throwing her a party?

11:29.830 --> 11:32.631
Because she's our mom, and she gave us life,

11:32.667 --> 11:35.467
and I need someone to
pick Emma up from daycare.

11:35.503 --> 11:37.836
Look, I don't want to see her.
I don't want to talk to her.

11:37.872 --> 11:40.806
I just want to sit here and
drink alone in an empty bar.

11:42.376 --> 11:43.375
Oh my God.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.411
An empty bar. We can have her party here!

11:45.446 --> 11:47.179
I'll be right back.
I left the guest list at home.

11:48.199 --> 11:50.266
Well cross my name off that list!

11:53.237 --> 11:54.887
Riley. Riley.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.022
- Huh?
- Riley. Guess who I am.

11:57.058 --> 12:00.993
"I love chardonnay and
stealing my son's birthdays."

12:01.028 --> 12:03.028
(Laughing)

12:03.064 --> 12:04.897
Ben.

12:06.734 --> 12:07.716
Oh, hey what's up, Ben?

12:09.837 --> 12:10.769
Nice.

12:10.805 --> 12:12.504
I'd be pissed if it wasn't so dead on.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.242
Oh my God, look at this place.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.477
Did you do all this to help me with mom?

12:18.512 --> 12:22.364
Yes. Yes, we did,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.334
because we're awesome.

12:25.386 --> 12:27.069
Oh my God! You're amazing.

12:27.104 --> 12:29.321
But hey, change of plans, we're actually
having my mom's party at the bar now.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.123
So, I'm gonna bring some
of this stuff down there.

12:31.158 --> 12:33.792
- Is it cool if you watch Emma for just a little bit longer?
- Yeah!

12:33.828 --> 12:34.827
Yeah, yeah, sure.

12:34.862 --> 12:37.062
Um, but, uh, you owe us big time.

12:37.098 --> 12:38.998
You are seriously the best friends ever.

12:39.033 --> 12:40.866
Is she sleeping?
I feel like I haven't seen her all day.

12:40.901 --> 12:42.051
Oh, no, no, no, she's not.

12:42.086 --> 12:44.486
But, I just put her in her
costume for the tribute video,

12:44.538 --> 12:45.671
and it's a surprise.

12:45.706 --> 12:48.440
The hat is hilarious! Right, Tucker?

12:48.476 --> 12:49.742
It's adorbs. It'll have you in stitches.

12:49.777 --> 12:50.709
Yeah.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.467
Oh. Honey.

12:58.519 --> 13:00.152
You're here.

13:00.187 --> 13:01.320
I didn't know you'd be back so soon.

13:03.090 --> 13:05.958
So, I got you a cake.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.694
"Happy Birthday, Eugene"?

13:09.997 --> 13:11.030
Wait, is that my real name?

13:12.700 --> 13:13.716
No, honey.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.769
Eugene is the son of the
woman I bought it off of.

13:16.821 --> 13:20.472
Now there's a bad mom.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.624
Okay, listen. This isn't quite ready,

13:22.660 --> 13:25.210
but I just want to give
you a little sneak preview

13:25.246 --> 13:28.414
of all that I've been doing to
show you how sorry I am, okay?

13:28.449 --> 13:30.449
Surprise!

13:32.420 --> 13:35.220
Well, looks like you and Eugene's
mom have a lot in common.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.660
Really, mom? Now you're just gonna
mock me on my biological birthday?

13:42.763 --> 13:44.563
Where the hell is everything?

13:44.598 --> 13:46.699
There was an entire party set up.

13:46.751 --> 13:48.550
Yeah, sure. Nice try.

13:48.602 --> 13:49.735
You really will say anything, won't you?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.336
No, Danny, you don't understand...

13:51.372 --> 13:52.438
sure I do!

13:52.473 --> 13:54.606
You always have to have
all the attention on you!

13:54.642 --> 13:57.376
You sacrifice your own son's birthday
because you don't want to share it!

13:57.411 --> 13:58.477
No, Danny, that's not...

13:58.502 --> 14:00.412
You have literally lied
to me my entire life.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.381
You know what's worse than you being a liar?

14:02.416 --> 14:04.116
You're selfish!

14:04.151 --> 14:05.884
You don't care about anyone but you!

14:05.920 --> 14:10.155
You know what? You can have your birthday
back because I don't want it anymore!

14:10.191 --> 14:11.924
I don't want it either, mom!

14:11.959 --> 14:13.659
If that's even your real name!

14:15.162 --> 14:17.980
Yeah, you know what? You're not the
only one who can slam doors around here!

14:19.900 --> 14:20.833
(Knob rattling)

14:20.868 --> 14:23.335
Oh, damn it! The wrong door.

14:26.548 --> 14:27.514
Hey, is anybody home?

14:27.549 --> 14:28.648
Bonnie: Ooh, Ben, Ben!

14:28.684 --> 14:30.700
Ben, please help me open this door!

14:30.736 --> 14:33.487
And where the hell are all
of Danny's decorations?

14:34.523 --> 14:36.089
Danny's decorations?

14:36.125 --> 14:38.258
Bonnie: Uh, Ben, the door?

14:38.293 --> 14:40.927
What's that?
No, you have a good day, I'll see you soon!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.195
Bonnie: Ben!

14:47.136 --> 14:48.902
- Hey.
- (Both scream)

14:50.773 --> 14:52.672
Hey, why didn't you tell me
those decorations were for Danny?

14:52.708 --> 14:53.774
Stop yelling at me!

14:53.826 --> 14:56.543
God,
we've been so busy taking care of your child

14:56.545 --> 14:57.711
and shooting your mom's video.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.646
I'm stressed Ben! You're stressing me out!

14:59.698 --> 15:02.332
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
And he's stressing me out!

15:02.384 --> 15:04.434
That's a lot of stress, Ben!
We're full of stress!

15:06.488 --> 15:07.420
You know what, I'm sorry.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.456
Everybody's mad at everybody because of me.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.491
All I want to do is get
this party over with.

15:11.527 --> 15:13.927
Oh, and by the way,
my mom's stuck in the bathroom.

15:13.962 --> 15:16.029
If you can not let her out until I get back,
that would be great.

15:16.064 --> 15:18.832
I have absolutely no problem with that.

15:21.804 --> 15:23.770
(Banging on the door)

15:25.808 --> 15:26.840
Oh my God.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.675
Wait, this is perfect.

15:28.710 --> 15:32.445
Bonnie: Okay, I swear if someone
doesn't open this door immediately,

15:32.481 --> 15:34.347
I'm gonna start flushing things!

15:34.383 --> 15:35.582
(Toilet flushes)

15:35.617 --> 15:36.650
You hear that?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.452
That was somebody's toothbrush!

15:39.488 --> 15:41.321
Oh, damn it, it was mine!

15:45.344 --> 15:47.143
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

15:47.179 --> 15:49.830
Yeah. Yeah, while she's stuck in there,

15:49.882 --> 15:51.898
we re-stage Emma's fall out here,

15:51.934 --> 15:52.899
blame it on her,

15:52.935 --> 15:53.917
take Emma to the E.R.,

15:53.952 --> 15:55.035
and tell Ben it just happened.

15:55.087 --> 15:57.938
I was gonna suggest we
eat some of this cake,

15:57.990 --> 15:59.706
but your idea is much better.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.477
Follow my lead.

16:04.513 --> 16:06.496
(Banging on the door)

16:06.548 --> 16:07.731
Oh, look, Riley!

16:07.766 --> 16:11.318
Emma is walking towards
Mrs. Wheeler's purse.

16:11.353 --> 16:13.386
Oh. Oh, be careful, Emma!

16:13.388 --> 16:18.141
You might trip on these straps
left carelessly on the floor.

16:18.193 --> 16:20.243
Bonnie: Wh... what's going on?

16:20.295 --> 16:21.294
- (Thud)
- (Bonnie gasps)

16:21.330 --> 16:22.295
Bonnie: Emma!

16:22.331 --> 16:25.999
Oh no, Emma tripped and fell on her head.

16:26.034 --> 16:28.985
Oh my God, there's blood everywhere!

16:29.037 --> 16:31.838
Bonnie: Oh my God, oh my God, let me out!

16:31.840 --> 16:33.857
(Pounding at the door) Emma,
honey, don't you worry, sweetie!

16:33.909 --> 16:35.609
We should go to the E.R.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.678
We'll take care of you, Emma!
You're in good hands now!

16:38.714 --> 16:40.780
Bonnie: Emma, don't worry, grandma's coming!

16:40.816 --> 16:42.349
(Door rattling intensifies) Oh my God!

16:42.384 --> 16:44.284
(Screaming frantically)

16:44.336 --> 16:46.586
(Screaming)

16:48.323 --> 16:49.272
What's going on?

16:49.324 --> 16:50.323
Emma fell!

16:50.325 --> 16:52.092
They're taking her to the emergency room!

16:52.094 --> 16:53.426
Oh God, I gotta call Ben!

16:53.428 --> 16:55.028
(Breathing heavily) Okay. Oh.

16:55.063 --> 16:56.129
(Phone rings)

16:56.164 --> 16:57.330
Oh. (Groans)

16:57.366 --> 16:58.815
He left his phone here.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.034
Okay. I'll go to the bar and get him,
and meet you at the E.R.

17:01.036 --> 17:05.821
All right? Okay! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

17:11.046 --> 17:12.579
Ben! Ben!

17:12.614 --> 17:15.714
Okay. Emma's okay, but she fell.

17:15.751 --> 17:18.585
- What?
- Riley and Tucker took her to the emergency room.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.487
Wait, did you steal my decorations?

17:20.521 --> 17:22.289
My baby!

17:22.324 --> 17:23.356
Yeah, wait for me. Wait for me.

17:26.361 --> 17:28.494
No, Ben! Ben!
Come back, you've got the keys!

17:28.530 --> 17:31.197
(Rattling the door handle)

17:31.233 --> 17:32.165
(Sighs)

17:34.036 --> 17:36.036
Okay.

17:36.071 --> 17:39.906
If this is my surprise party,
you can all come out now.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.526
Yeah, I didn't think so.

17:45.497 --> 17:47.514
Emma! Oh my God,
I went everywhere looking for you guys.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.581
Is she okay?

17:48.617 --> 17:49.699
She's fine.

17:49.751 --> 17:52.552
You'd be amazed at how quickly babies heal.

17:52.554 --> 17:57.490
Yeah, you're gonna love these new 24-hour
stitches that'll come out tomorrow.

17:57.526 --> 18:00.293
Stitches? Will she have a scar?

18:00.329 --> 18:02.062
Oh God,
I can't believe I wasn't there for her.

18:02.097 --> 18:03.279
Oh God, oh God.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.115
Is she okay?

18:05.150 --> 18:07.133
Oh. Oh...

18:07.169 --> 18:10.103
Oh, by the way,
I also ripped the bar door off its hinges.

18:10.138 --> 18:12.772
You might wanna call somebody.

18:12.808 --> 18:13.807
Mom, she's fine.

18:13.809 --> 18:15.809
But look, I'm so sorry.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.010
I totally messed up your birthday again.

18:17.045 --> 18:18.762
Oh, no, you didn't.

18:18.814 --> 18:21.681
Emma's okay, and that's all that matters.

18:21.717 --> 18:23.516
I know, little boo-boo.

18:23.552 --> 18:24.818
Just a little one.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.254
And honey, I shouldn't have put
so much pressure on you. Okay?

18:28.290 --> 18:30.590
And this whole Danny thing,
it was completely my fault.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.425
You know,
I should have just told him the truth.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.194
Fine.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.245
I'm listening.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.047
If you even know what the truth is.

18:38.183 --> 18:41.234
Okay, you know what, Danny?
Here's the truth.

18:41.236 --> 18:43.920
Yes, I was being selfish.

18:43.972 --> 18:45.872
Completely selfish.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.958
And it started out about me not
wanting to share my birthday,

18:49.011 --> 18:51.945
but,
it became about me not wanting to share you.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.515
When it was time for you to start school,

18:55.550 --> 18:57.751
I wasn't ready to let you go.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.719
You were my baby.

18:59.755 --> 19:01.488
My first.

19:01.523 --> 19:03.456
I mean, we were a team, you and I.

19:03.508 --> 19:08.128
And then I found out that if I told them
that your birthday was two weeks later,

19:08.163 --> 19:10.397
you missed the cutoff.

19:10.432 --> 19:13.166
And you got to stay home
with me for another year.

19:15.153 --> 19:17.303
And Danny,
that was the best year of my life.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.975
You made me start school early.

19:23.712 --> 19:26.679
Trust me, it was best for both of us.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.767
Can you ever forgive me?

19:34.956 --> 19:36.539
It's okay, mom.

19:38.727 --> 19:40.693
I'll always be your baby.

19:40.729 --> 19:42.662
And, I'm proud to share
the same birthday with you.

19:42.714 --> 19:46.583
And I promise not to make
it all about me anymore.

19:46.635 --> 19:50.754
(Laughing hysterically)

19:50.806 --> 19:53.640
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, that wasn't a joke?

19:55.510 --> 19:57.644
Well, mom,
I didn't pull off much of a surprise,

19:57.679 --> 20:00.563
but Happy Birthday. I love you.

20:00.599 --> 20:03.650
Aww, and I love my boys.

20:03.685 --> 20:05.518
Happy Birthday, Danny.

20:05.570 --> 20:07.570
Happy Birthday, mom.

20:07.606 --> 20:10.573
I don't know who "Eugene" is,
but I'm eating his cake.

20:14.565 --> 20:19.020
Mrs. Wheeler, Mrs. Wheeler.
Get ready to be wowed.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.169
Okay.

20:20.221 --> 20:22.304
<i>Happy Birthday, mom.</i>

20:22.340 --> 20:24.256
<i>We love you.</i>

20:24.258 --> 20:26.425
<i>Hope it's a great one,
Mrs. Wheeler.</i>

20:26.477 --> 20:29.311
<i>Mrs. Wheeler, what can I say?</i>

20:29.347 --> 20:31.313
<i>You steal my heart.</i>

20:31.349 --> 20:34.033
<i>I love you.</i>

20:35.305 --> 20:41.232
