BYRON BENNETT: Some people think that
surfing is a relationship with the sea,

01:07.708 --> 01:09.875
when it's really
a relationship between you

01:11.833 --> 01:12.833
and yourself.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.292
The sea is gonna do whatever it wants.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.458
My mom taught me that.

01:24.917 --> 01:27.083
She expected me to excel at everything.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.500
Even surfing.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.208
You know,

01:32.250 --> 01:33.875
I was a little kid when she taught me.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.875
And people stared,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.833
as if surfing
had been invented by white folks.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.292
But my mom told me

01:43.083 --> 01:46.042
Black people surf in the Caribbean,
where she was born,

01:48.292 --> 01:52.333
and our people surf
in African and Asian countries too.

01:54.958 --> 01:55.958
I didn't know either,

01:57.125 --> 01:58.250
'cause I didn't see it,

02:00.125 --> 02:01.833
but that didn't stop me from learning.

02:03.417 --> 02:04.375
And it didn't stop me

02:04.375 --> 02:06.917
when I was the only Black man
in my doctoral program.

02:08.125 --> 02:10.417
I'm still the only Black ocean scientist
in my lab,

02:10.417 --> 02:11.792
and that's why I'm here.

02:11.792 --> 02:14.500
I'm hoping that some of you
might follow in my footsteps.

02:23.292 --> 02:24.792
