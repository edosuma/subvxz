Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"The Monahans and MacGoverns"</font>

00:07.090 --> 00:08.705
I love you,
Josephine Monahan.

00:08.793 --> 00:10.508
I love you too,
Clayton MacGovern.

00:10.596 --> 00:13.512
- I want to be with you.
- You're with me right now.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.721
No, not just sneaking around
in a barn at night.

00:15.809 --> 00:17.056
You know that can't be.

00:17.144 --> 00:18.674
Neither of our families
would allow it.

00:18.762 --> 00:21.447
Then run away with me!
To hell with our families!

00:21.647 --> 00:22.661
Shh, shh!

00:24.895 --> 00:27.416
Oh no, it's my brother, Tucker,
and his stupid friend, J.D.

00:27.504 --> 00:29.737
They're probably drunk.
You gotta get out of here, Clayton.

00:29.824 --> 00:32.665
Tucker'll shoot you dead if he
catches you on our property.

00:33.136 --> 00:35.486
Also because you just
had your **** inside me.

00:35.608 --> 00:38.257
- It still is.
- What are you talking about?

00:38.345 --> 00:40.446
I'm still inside of you,
pretty Josephine.

00:41.514 --> 00:42.628
Oh.

00:42.957 --> 00:44.693
Well, then,
you best get going.

00:44.781 --> 00:46.858
I'll go out and distract him
while you sneak out the back.

00:46.945 --> 00:48.334
I'll see you
tomorrow night.

00:48.422 --> 00:50.523
You bet your little penis
you will.

00:55.618 --> 00:57.709
Hey, J.D., you got any more
beer in that cooler?

00:57.797 --> 00:59.842
No, Tuck, we're out.
Don't you got any weed?

00:59.930 --> 01:01.631
Yeah, I got weed,
you dumb-ass.

01:01.719 --> 01:03.735
I got a stash in the barn.
What the...

01:03.823 --> 01:05.450
Don't you point that
at me!

01:05.539 --> 01:07.437
Jo-Jo, what the ****
are you doing in the barn?

01:07.524 --> 01:10.428
I was just riding
one of the stallions.

01:10.516 --> 01:13.078
Was the stallion's name
Clayton MacGovern?

01:13.258 --> 01:15.859
Oh, shut up, J.D.!

01:18.543 --> 01:20.730
Run, Clayton!

01:20.941 --> 01:22.475
Let's get him!

"Dear Mike Tyson
Mystery Team,

01:37.913 --> 01:40.329
I'm in love with a girl,
and she's in love with me.

01:40.456 --> 01:42.805
But, unfortunately,
our families have been in a feud

01:42.893 --> 01:44.122
going back generations,

01:44.210 --> 01:45.758
so our love cannot be.

01:45.846 --> 01:49.195
Please help.
Yours very truly, Clayton MacGovern.

01:49.426 --> 01:53.230
Do you know anything about
how to increase penis size?

01:53.325 --> 01:54.715
Asking for a friend."

01:54.803 --> 01:58.536
Oh, Yung, uh, you actually do know
something about increasing penis size.

01:58.624 --> 02:00.005
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:00.093 --> 02:01.774
Because I watched you
shower this morning,

02:01.862 --> 02:04.833
and you increased
my penis size.

02:06.107 --> 02:07.474
Up-high, Marquess!

02:07.562 --> 02:10.709
Pigeon, her father
is standing right here.

02:10.803 --> 02:14.153
Which is why I didn't say
what I wanted to say,

02:14.241 --> 02:16.991
which is that
I watched her shower

02:17.079 --> 02:19.645
and slather soap
all over her naked body,

02:19.733 --> 02:21.481
and I didn't get hard.

02:21.569 --> 02:23.117
Not even remotely.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.224
But I did not
say that precisely,

02:25.312 --> 02:28.028
because I didn't want
to offend her father.

02:28.153 --> 02:29.950
And I appreciate that,
Pigeon.

02:30.038 --> 02:31.645
To the Mystery Mobile!

02:32.279 --> 02:33.927
Hey. Hey, hold up.

02:34.013 --> 02:35.588
Mike! Hold up, team!

02:35.676 --> 02:36.973
Where you guys going?

02:37.061 --> 02:40.793
Wyoming. There's a family
feud involving a tiny penis.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.245
Okay, okay.

02:42.333 --> 02:44.088
Uh, but before you
take on their mystery,

02:44.176 --> 02:46.292
which I know you'll solve
because you guys are the best,

02:46.379 --> 02:47.706
and I know I don't
tell you that enough...

02:47.793 --> 02:49.471
Oh, my God.
Just get to the point.

02:49.559 --> 02:51.495
I hear you, Yung.
Economy of words.

02:51.583 --> 02:52.901
Precision in communication.

02:52.989 --> 02:54.151
Jesus!

02:54.239 --> 02:56.231
Hey, **** you, Pigeon!
Okay, Mike.

02:56.379 --> 02:58.820
As you know, I've been going
through some tough times of late.

02:58.918 --> 03:01.276
I've incurred massive debts
and tax liabilities

03:01.364 --> 03:02.588
that I can never
hope to repay.

03:02.675 --> 03:05.424
But, if I understand
Nevada tax law correctly,

03:05.511 --> 03:07.593
I would be shielded
from this grievance

03:07.680 --> 03:10.489
if I were
"mentally disabled"

03:10.598 --> 03:14.299
and "not someone who could
take care of themselves."

03:14.387 --> 03:16.018
I'm with you so far.
Go on.

03:16.106 --> 03:18.426
Okay, okay.
So, in this scenario,

03:18.614 --> 03:21.690
you would be my caregiver,
and the Mike Tyson Mystery team

03:21.778 --> 03:24.950
would now be
a "daycare center."

03:25.458 --> 03:26.723
Hmm, I like that.

03:26.811 --> 03:29.791
Okay, good, good.
So an inspector will come out to the house

03:29.879 --> 03:32.065
and make sure we have
**** like outer protectors,

03:32.153 --> 03:33.853
bumpers around
any sharp corners,

03:33.940 --> 03:35.588
a gate in front of
the stairs, etcetera.

03:35.675 --> 03:37.223
And I will handle
all of that.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.926
I can't thank you
enough, Deezy.

03:39.014 --> 03:40.565
Unfortunately,
the state does require

03:40.653 --> 03:43.534
that all daycare providers
take a CPR certification class.

03:43.622 --> 03:47.120
You know, in case, God forbid,
I choke on a hot dog or a marble.

03:47.208 --> 03:49.602
Oh, God, don't even
say such a thing, Deezy.

03:49.689 --> 03:52.857
I'm going to run,
not walk, to that CPR class.

03:55.728 --> 03:57.651
Michael, this is silly.

03:57.739 --> 03:58.825
Get in the van!

03:58.973 --> 04:00.012
I wish I could,
Marquess,

04:00.099 --> 04:02.948
but man, like I said,
I'm gonna run, not walk.

04:03.036 --> 04:05.618
I wish I had said I was gonna
drive, not walk,

04:05.705 --> 04:08.262
but I didn't, and I'm a man
to my word.

04:08.941 --> 04:12.129
So, are we still
going to Wyoming, or...

04:12.348 --> 04:13.632
What is happening?

04:17.356 --> 04:19.567
I feel so bad
for this Clayton boy.

04:19.668 --> 04:22.885
When families don't support their
children in matters of the heart...

04:22.973 --> 04:25.704
I... I mean, you love
who you love, and...

04:26.699 --> 04:28.231
I'm just, um...

04:28.625 --> 04:30.826
Feeling lots of feelings,
and, uh...

04:31.841 --> 04:33.692
Really? Really.

04:33.780 --> 04:34.861
No one cares.

04:34.992 --> 04:37.465
Oh, I'm sorry, I was
listening to music.

04:38.604 --> 04:40.815
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was listening to you.

04:40.903 --> 04:42.254
I don't care
what you're feeling.

04:42.341 --> 04:44.729
Look,
I didn't support my son, Bosie,

04:44.817 --> 04:46.455
when he fell in love
with Oscar Wilde

04:46.543 --> 04:48.713
and I'll be damned
if I allow these parents

04:48.801 --> 04:50.815
to make the same mistake
I did. I just...

04:51.733 --> 04:54.282
So much guilt,
so much shame.

04:54.653 --> 04:58.239
I'm sorry, Marquess.
I am really sorry.

04:58.558 --> 05:00.958
Maybe I wasn't clear
when I said

05:01.051 --> 05:03.042
I don't care
what you're feeling,

05:03.215 --> 05:05.776
I should have just said,
"Stop talking!"

05:05.864 --> 05:08.645
Guess who's certified
in CPR, bitches?

05:08.754 --> 05:10.971
I'm sorry, Yung,
I didn't mean to call you a bitch.

05:11.059 --> 05:13.073
But sometimes,
you can be a bitch.

05:13.161 --> 05:15.911
Like the first thing in the
morning before you get your coffee.

05:16.223 --> 05:18.557
Oh, Mi...
Don't you wanna drive?

05:18.645 --> 05:21.629
No, Marquess, I'll just sit
back here ready to save lives.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.096
Buh-buh-buh-buh.
You don't need your seat belts, man.

05:24.183 --> 05:25.227
You got me.

05:25.315 --> 05:27.190
I can bring you back
to life, man.

05:27.278 --> 05:29.950
I have the power of God.
I am God.

05:30.307 --> 05:32.340
Mm-kay.

05:36.559 --> 05:39.567
Drive faster, Marquess,
and feel free to close your eyes.

05:39.832 --> 05:42.221
Hey, Yung, you want to
choke on a sucking candy?

05:42.309 --> 05:43.528
Uh, no thanks.

05:43.736 --> 05:45.612
Here, Pigeon, I learned
the Heimlich maneuver.

05:47.559 --> 05:49.799
Okay, first thing you do
in an emergency.

05:49.887 --> 05:52.324
You look around,
you make sure everything is safe.

05:52.411 --> 05:53.626
Dad!

05:53.713 --> 05:55.261
Then see if the victim
is responsive.

05:55.348 --> 05:57.385
Sir, sir, are you okay?

05:57.473 --> 05:59.192
Now, here's something
I did not know.

05:59.356 --> 06:01.791
You cannot just render aid
without their permission

06:01.879 --> 06:03.536
because of legal whatnots.

06:03.623 --> 06:04.904
Isn't that interesting?

06:04.991 --> 06:06.551
I find that very interesting.

06:06.639 --> 06:08.333
But that's the world
we live in.

06:08.575 --> 06:10.762
So I'm gonna ask the victim
for permission.

06:11.168 --> 06:14.174
Sir, do I have your permission
to render aid? -

06:14.262 --> 06:15.549
What is happening?

06:15.637 --> 06:17.387
The victim has passed out,

06:17.903 --> 06:19.885
and he doesn't appear
to be breathing.

06:20.028 --> 06:21.987
This is called
the AED machine.

06:22.074 --> 06:23.489
It stands for...
I don't know.

06:23.576 --> 06:25.057
Here, let me look it up
on my phone.

06:25.292 --> 06:26.870
- Dad, hurry!
- Oh, my God!

06:26.958 --> 06:29.347
Ugh, I'm not getting
any reception.

06:30.508 --> 06:32.056
Oh, wait, we need
to check and see

06:32.184 --> 06:35.334
if the victim is wearing a
necklace or any metal jewelry,

06:35.421 --> 06:36.627
so we don't electrocute him.

06:36.715 --> 06:38.070
Okay, no jewelry.

06:38.157 --> 06:40.539
That's suprisin'.
He's very flashy.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.028
Michael!

06:42.213 --> 06:44.014
Okay, everyone clear.

06:49.627 --> 06:51.227
Are we there yet?

06:56.480 --> 06:58.066
So why did Clayton
contact you, exactly?

06:58.153 --> 07:00.073
Is it about his tiny dick?
Just so we're clear,

07:00.161 --> 07:01.793
he didn't get that from me.
He got it from his mother.

07:01.881 --> 07:04.063
My side of the family,
you mean.

07:04.278 --> 07:06.887
'Cause I don't have
a tiny dick.

07:07.546 --> 07:10.468
What? What? I don't!

07:10.556 --> 07:12.020
Take your pill,
Mary Lynne.

07:12.108 --> 07:16.721
Okay. Um, there is an additional
reason your son contacted us,

07:16.809 --> 07:19.211
but I'm sure he would prefer
that we speak to him privately.

07:19.298 --> 07:20.442
Do you know where he is?

07:20.530 --> 07:22.878
He better be out in the south
pasture deworming cattle.

07:23.269 --> 07:25.850
But if this is about Josephine
Monahan, you're wasting your time.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.081
She and the rest of her family
can go straight to hell.

07:28.168 --> 07:29.622
May I ask a question?

07:29.709 --> 07:31.256
I think we're all wondering,

07:31.481 --> 07:33.042
can I have a ginger ale?

07:33.239 --> 07:34.815
No, that's not what
we're wondering,

07:34.903 --> 07:36.346
I believe what
we're all wondering

07:36.434 --> 07:38.801
is why your two families
are feuding.

07:38.965 --> 07:40.833
Long ago, it was cattle.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.200
Then it was oil.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.848
Now, it's just
in our blood.

07:44.936 --> 07:45.999
Interesting,

07:46.087 --> 07:48.112
but I think I would have
enjoyed the answer more

07:48.200 --> 07:50.629
if I would have had
a cold glass of ginger ale.

07:50.896 --> 07:52.645
Okay,
Mr. and Mrs. MacGovern...

07:52.732 --> 07:54.980
Please, call us
Monty MacGovern

07:55.067 --> 07:56.382
and Mary Lynne MacGovern.

07:56.469 --> 07:58.017
Mm-kay. It seems longer.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.252
Monty MacGovern
and Mary Lynne MacGovern,

08:00.339 --> 08:01.575
your son is in love.

08:01.663 --> 08:03.299
Shouldn't that be
all that matters?

08:03.387 --> 08:05.284
Even if we were willing
to end this feud,

08:05.372 --> 08:07.760
I want Hugey Monahan
to make the first move.

08:07.926 --> 08:09.328
And good luck with that.

08:09.415 --> 08:10.809
50 milligrams?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.879
What is wrong with you?

08:14.627 --> 08:18.129
There's no way in hell we're making
the first move to end this feud.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.250
Isn't that right,
Hugey?

08:21.717 --> 08:23.132
That's right, Sugar.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.635
Dear Lord!

08:25.723 --> 08:28.180
Oh, my God,
just like that commercial.

08:28.511 --> 08:31.979
No Monahan
will ever marry a MacGovern.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.638
And anyway, Josephine is going
to marry Tucker's best friend

08:36.207 --> 08:37.956
J.D. Montague.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.871
Just so you know,
I'd rather die than marry J.D.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.371
Wait, wait, Josephine!

08:42.458 --> 08:44.126
Nobody needs to die.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.104
I promise this will
all work out.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.852
I'll talk to your parents,
I...

08:49.389 --> 08:51.069
Josephine!

08:51.157 --> 08:52.577
Josephine!

08:52.694 --> 08:54.674
Where are you,
my sweet Josephine?

08:54.825 --> 08:57.776
She ain't your sweet
Josephine for much longer.

08:57.965 --> 09:00.460
We're getting married.
Her parents said so.

09:00.548 --> 09:02.461
J.D., what are you doing?

09:05.790 --> 09:07.053
Oh!

09:09.682 --> 09:11.182
You shot me!

09:11.744 --> 09:12.825
I'm dying.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.225
Stay with him.
I'll go get help.

09:16.015 --> 09:18.257
I did want to marry
a Monahan.

09:18.646 --> 09:20.061
But not Josephine.

09:20.553 --> 09:22.616
It was Tucker I loved.

09:23.956 --> 09:25.838
J.D.'s dead. I killed him!

09:25.925 --> 09:27.434
It was an accident,
I swear!

09:27.522 --> 09:29.903
I believe you, Clayton,
but no one else will.

09:29.991 --> 09:31.895
All I want is
to be with Josephine.

09:31.983 --> 09:33.926
When Tucker sees what I've
done, he'll kill me!

09:34.014 --> 09:36.348
No. Not if you're
already dead.

09:36.435 --> 09:37.449
What?

09:37.536 --> 09:39.685
Here, here, here.
Lie down next to him.

09:39.772 --> 09:42.378
Okay, now we need
a second bullet

09:42.466 --> 09:43.851
to have been fired.

09:44.413 --> 09:47.748
Oh, shit.

09:49.215 --> 09:52.054
Ah, well, at least
it was a peaceful death.

09:52.514 --> 09:54.239
- What is that?
- Sriracha sauce.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.848
Well, I'm doing
this paleo thing.

09:55.936 --> 09:57.970
Well, it's not totally paleo,
because I drink,

09:58.057 --> 10:00.405
I mean, I'm not not gonna
drink, that's crazy.

10:00.492 --> 10:03.614
So basically, I'm just eating
boneless, skinless chicken breast

10:03.702 --> 10:05.364
and kale, and I got
so sick of it

10:05.452 --> 10:07.114
and then my friend, Daniel...

10:07.202 --> 10:08.380
Oh, here we go. Shit.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.215
Here. Now, play dead.

10:10.302 --> 10:12.036
Once everyone leaves,
you'll run off

10:12.124 --> 10:13.600
and I'll tell Josephine
to meet you.

10:13.688 --> 10:15.726
Then, you can finally
be together.

10:15.937 --> 10:18.247
Like <i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>
This is major.

10:18.335 --> 10:19.874
This is so major.

10:20.112 --> 10:23.772
Oh, no! Oh!
They're both dead!

10:23.905 --> 10:24.930
No!

10:25.017 --> 10:27.366
These young men
both dead.

10:27.453 --> 10:29.163
Ah, so tragic!

10:29.251 --> 10:31.500
Clayton, no!

10:31.757 --> 10:33.559
There, there, my dear.

10:33.647 --> 10:35.474
He's not
really dead. Come with me.

10:35.827 --> 10:38.529
Oh, shit. This dude's
still breathing.

10:39.465 --> 10:40.679
Okay, no jewelry.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.181
I can't thank you enough.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.794
All right. Let's go
back in there,

10:43.882 --> 10:46.085
and remember,
you're supposed to be sad.

10:46.173 --> 10:47.173
Right.

10:47.311 --> 10:49.163
Okay, everyone clear.

10:52.097 --> 10:53.492
How the ****
did I electrocute him?

10:53.579 --> 10:55.460
He wasn't even wearing
any jewelry.

10:56.682 --> 10:58.697
He has nipple rings.

10:58.907 --> 11:00.365
We both do.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.180
We got them as a hidden
symbol of our love!

11:03.357 --> 11:06.173
I'm coming to be
with you, Clayton.

11:08.712 --> 11:11.825
Well, at least they both
died a peaceful death.
