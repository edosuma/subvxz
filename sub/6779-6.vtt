00:06.000 --> 00:08.161
( theme music playing )

01:53.240 --> 01:57.006
( woman pants )
BOY, THE AIR'S THINNER UP HERE
THAN I WOULD'VE THOUGHT.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.146
Sarah:
COME ON, FIONA,
YOU CAN DO IT!

01:59.250 --> 02:02.413
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU
THE VIEW FROM THE TOP!

02:02.520 --> 02:05.341
YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

02:05.450 --> 02:07.111
IT'S GOOD
THAT I GOT OUT.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.359
I THINK WAS GETTING
A LITTLE DEPRESSED INSIDE.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.826
JUST ME AND THE FUMES
FROM MY KILN

02:11.930 --> 02:14.319
AND THAT MOROSE N.P.R.

02:14.430 --> 02:15.852
- HERE.
- WHOO!

02:15.960 --> 02:18.064
TAKE THIS.
COME ON!

02:18.170 --> 02:19.933
- ALL RIGHT.
- ( hooting )

02:20.040 --> 02:24.500
JUST THROUGH HERE
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY
TO THE OCEAN.

02:30.010 --> 02:31.705
BE CAREFUL UP AHEAD.

02:31.810 --> 02:35.678
- WHAT?
- WE'RE MOMENTS FROM
THE TOP, MERE MOMENTS.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.749
( panting )
I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GONNA--

02:38.850 --> 02:40.556
MAKE IT.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.724
( gasps )

02:48.630 --> 02:50.427
FIONA?

02:57.270 --> 02:59.306
FIONA?

03:06.580 --> 03:09.219
- THIS TOP DOESN'T FIT.
- Anthony: HEE-YAH!

03:09.320 --> 03:12.517
IT'S THE RIGHT TOP,
IT'S THE WRONG CONTAINER.
PUT THE BROCCOLI IN A ZIPLOC.

03:12.620 --> 03:15.054
THEY'RE DIDN'T
EAT THE BROCCOLI
FROM YESTERDAY.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.048
- WHERE'S THE CARROTS?
- GET OFF OF ME!

03:17.160 --> 03:19.822
WHAT IS--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.465
JESUS.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.868
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME TO GO.
PUT YOUR JACKET ON.

03:25.970 --> 03:28.734
- I'M NOT PUTTING ON
THAT BUSTED OLD JACKET.
- YES, YOU ARE. WE JUST GOT IT!

03:28.840 --> 03:31.502
- NO, I'M NOT!
I'M GETTING MY OTHER ONE.
- YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS!

03:31.610 --> 03:33.805
- YOU WANT THAT ONE, GO GET IT!
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS!

03:33.910 --> 03:36.549
- WHERE DID YOU PUT IT?
- I DIDN'T PUT IT ANYWHERE!
IT'S YOUR JACKET!

03:36.650 --> 03:41.371
I'LL FIND THE OTHER JACKET.
JUST GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH,
YS.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.085
IT'S LIKE HE WANTS ME
TO LOSE MY TEMPER.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.748
NO KID WANTS THAT.
JUST GIVE HIM TIME.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.579
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR TWO WEEKS.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.453
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
WHERE HE COMES FROM,

03:49.560 --> 03:51.448
WHAT THE SOCIAL WORKER
SAID ABOUT HIS MOTHER.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.051
MY SISTER'S A DRUG ADDICT.
TAYLOR NEVER ACT ED
LIKE THIS!

03:54.160 --> 03:55.559
- TAYLOR'S A GIRL.
- SO?

03:55.660 --> 03:58.322
SO SHE ISN'T HARDWIRED
TO BE AGGRESSIVE
AND TERRITORIAL.

03:58.430 --> 04:00.796
THAT'S THE REASON
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE SAME PROBLEM

04:00.900 --> 04:02.936
- WITH YOUR FATHER
THAT ECFIU DO.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.100
SO NOW EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN ME
AND MY FATHER IS MY FAULT?

04:06.210 --> 04:07.734
NO, I'M--

04:07.840 --> 04:09.137
IS YOUR BROTHER READY?

04:09.240 --> 04:11.344
HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHERE YOU PUT
HIS HAT.

04:11.450 --> 04:14.647
( sighs )
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.715
( sighs )

04:22.490 --> 04:25.084
Ruth:
WHY DO YOU NEED
MR. SIBLEY'S NAME?

04:25.190 --> 04:27.249
NO, MR. SIBLEY IS
RIGHT HERE.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.692
WHAT ARE THE LAST FOUR DIGS
OF YOUR SOCIAL?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.529
4281.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.131
4281.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.992
CORRECT.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.636
CORRECT.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.799
CORRECT.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.207
I'LL HOLD.

04:40.310 --> 04:42.107
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING?

04:42.210 --> 04:43.370
YEAH, THE POTS AND PANS.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.040
OH, I MUST HAVE
FORGOTTEN THEM.

04:46.150 --> 04:47.913
WE CAN JUST
BUY NEW ONES.

04:48.020 --> 04:50.079
I CAN GO DOWN
TO CRATE & BARREL
RIGHT NOW.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.511
WE HAVE PRACTICALLY
A BRAND-NEW SET BACK
AT THE HOUSE.

04:52.620 --> 04:55.509
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO RAID THEIR SUPPLY.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.554
BUT YOU LOVED
THAT CALPHALON.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.958
YOU RAVED ABOUT IT
WHEN WE GOT IT.

05:00.060 --> 05:03.291
THAT WAS BECAUSE IT
WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE
WITH ANODIZED ALUMINUM.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.459
WE DON'T NEED THOSE,
WE'LL BUY NEW ONES.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.834
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE
WASTE OF MONEY.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.861
I'M HERE.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.506
GOOD.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.374
AND YOU DO THE GAS
AS WELL? SPLENDID.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.801
NO, THANK YOU.

05:20.850 --> 05:24.115
DID YOU TALK TO DEAN HIKOLOS
ABOUT GOING BACK TO WORK?

05:24.220 --> 05:27.155
NO, I...
I DON'T WANT TO.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.557
I'M NOT ADY.

05:28.660 --> 05:31.424
IT'LL BE
THE SUMMER SESSION
IF AT ALL.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.794
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE
DOING SO MUCH BETTER.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.219
OH, I AM.

05:35.330 --> 05:37.218
AND I WANNA KEEP
DOING BETTER,

05:37.330 --> 05:41.130
WITHOUT ALL
THE STRESS AND STRAIN
OF TEACHING SCHOOL.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.959
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

05:46.610 --> 05:49.579
REMEMBER WHEN
WE BOUGHT THIS?

05:49.680 --> 05:52.649
THAT'S WHEN YOU
ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU.

05:57.350 --> 06:00.956
OKAY, I'LL GO GET
OUR POTS AND PANS.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.119
I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

06:05.230 --> 06:07.050
I'LL BE WAITING.

06:08.330 --> 06:10.560
( fake chuckle )

06:11.770 --> 06:14.739
( laughs )

06:14.840 --> 06:18.059
OKAY, YOU DID REALLY WELL
ON YOUR TYPING TEST.
GOT A 95.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.571
- THANKS.
- DON'T WORRY,
NO ONE EVER HAS GOTTEN 100.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.240
ONE PERSON DID,
BUT I THINK SHE WAS PSYCHIC.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.468
- OKAY, WE HAVE ONE DOWNTOWN--
- OH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
TELL YOU,

06:28.580 --> 06:31.447
I HAVE APPLIED FOR THIS GRANT
FOR EMERGING ARTISTS,

06:31.550 --> 06:33.711
AND IF I GET IT--
WHICH COULD BE THIS MONTH,

06:33.820 --> 06:36.823
OR EVEN THIS WEEK,
I'D HAVE TO STOP WORKING,
LIKE, IMMEDIATELY.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.228
YEAH WELL, "TEMP" IS SHORT
FOR TEMPORARY.

06:39.330 --> 06:40.991
OKAY, HERE WE ARE.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.819
"QUALITY CONTROL
AUDITING CLERK,
LEGAL DEPARTMENT,

06:43.930 --> 06:46.490
BRAEDEN CHEMICAL.

ACCURACY OF FIGURES,

06:46.600 --> 06:48.795
BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
RECORDED BY OTHER WORKERS,

06:48.900 --> 06:51.164
AS WELL AS
SUPPORT THE SUPPORT STAFF
IN GENERAL TASKS."

06:51.270 --> 06:53.170
- SOUND GOOD?
- OKAY.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.579
OKAY, LET ME CALL OVER THERE
AND SEE IF THEY'VE FOUND
ANYONE YET.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.477
IT'S A VERY
CONSERVATIVE COMPANY.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.548
YOU DO HAVE
CORPORATE ATTIRE, RIGHT?

07:00.650 --> 07:03.312
LIKE A BUSINESS SUIT?

07:03.420 --> 07:07.151
OR A NICE BLOUSE,
A SKIRT, SOME HOSE.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.820
Sarah:
I FEEL SO LUCKY.

07:10.930 --> 07:15.355
I AM JUST SO LUCKY
TO HAVE BEEN WITH HER
IN HER FINAL MOMENTS.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.826
WHAT A GIFT.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.363
SHE WAS SO ALIVE.

07:19.470 --> 07:22.337
AND SHE WAS HAPPY
HAPPY HAPPY,

07:22.440 --> 07:26.069
AND EXCITED
TO SEE THE VIEW.

07:26.170 --> 07:29.708
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
SUCH A PERFECT MORNING
IN TOPANGA CANYON.

07:29.810 --> 07:32.347
WERE EITHER OF YOU OUT
THIS MORNING?

07:32.450 --> 07:35.214
- NO.
- OH.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.619
I CAN'T BELIEVE
FIONA'S GONE.

07:38.720 --> 07:43.020
- YOU KNEW HER TOO, HUH?
- YEAH, I DID.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.156
IT'S LIKE THE SECOND PERSON
YOU'VE KNOWN.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.955
Nate: I KNOW.

07:48.060 --> 07:51.097
THIS JUST MUST BE THE TIME
WHEN EVERYONE'S DYING.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.634
NATE, IT WAS
HER TIME.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.833
I WAS COMPELLED
TO BRING HER.

07:55.940 --> 07:58.408
I WAS DRIVING
THROUGH THE CANYON
TO GO ON MY HIKE

07:58.510 --> 08:00.831
AND MY CAR JUST PULLED OVER
INTO HER DRIVEWAY.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.168
WOW.

08:02.280 --> 08:06.717
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING SAID,
"BRING FIONA WITH YOU."

08:06.820 --> 08:09.584
THE SPIRIT
HAD TO HAVE HER.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.184
THE SPIRIT...

08:14.290 --> 08:17.327
WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.898
( cell phone ringing )

08:24.230 --> 08:26.323
CORONER'S OFFICE.

08:26.430 --> 08:28.398
SHE MUST BE READY TO GO.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.400
AH...

08:30.510 --> 08:31.966
( chuckles )

08:34.480 --> 08:36.801
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.299
- WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?
- YEP.

08:39.410 --> 08:41.446
( laughs )
YAY!

08:41.550 --> 08:44.644
I LOVE THESE FLOWERS.
( sniffs )

08:44.750 --> 08:45.910
OOH, THEY SMELL GOOD.
SMELL THEM.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.749
Woman:
IF YOU'RE UPSET, TELL HIM.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.624
IF HE LOVES YOU
HE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO HEAR THAT.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.755
I DON'T WANT
TO FREAK HIM OUT
UNNECESSARILY.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.296
- I THOUGHT BILLY WAS
BACK ON HIS MEDICATION.
- AH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.938
"I'M BACK ON MY MEDS,"
LIKE THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
"IS HE ON OR IS HE OFF?"

09:00.040 --> 09:03.532
HE'S COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS
TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALL
JUST EXHAUSTED.

09:03.640 --> 09:07.076
THEY SHOULD CALL IT
"BIPOLAR ASSHOLE DISORDER."

09:07.180 --> 09:10.104
JUST TELL HIM. OKAY?
YOU NEED A BREAK.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.609
( sighs )

09:11.710 --> 09:14.270
YEAH, THAT SCARES ME TOO.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.610
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
TO KEEP HIM CLOSE

09:16.720 --> 09:19.757
SO THAT IF HE FALLS OFF
THE EDGE SOMEONE WILL KNOW.

09:23.060 --> 09:26.120
PEOPLE ARE STARTING
TO NOTICE I'M PREGNANT.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.463
BRENDA,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.788
- OKAY, LIKE A GLOWING MOMMY.
- THANK YOU.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.993
REALLY.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.762
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT ONE
AT HOME AND ONE IN THERE,

09:37.870 --> 09:40.737
YOU KNOW, PUT YO ENERGY
WHERE IT DESERVES TO BE.

09:40.840 --> 09:44.139
- BILLY CAN TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.
- YEAH.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.014
YEAH, I KNOW.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.610
OKAY.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.345
Vanessa:
YOU LOOK HOT.

09:51.450 --> 09:54.988
I OUGHT TO LOOK FUCKING HOT.
I'VE BEEN STARVING MYSELF
LIKE A REFUGEE.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.149
-(laughs)
- ( television playing )

09:57.260 --> 09:59.694
OH, YOU'RE FUNNY.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.496
I COULD'VE DONE
THAT JOKE BETTER.

10:02.600 --> 10:06.058
( groans ) I GO'I'I'A
TO GO TO THE AIRPORT SOON
AND PICK UP THE BABYSI'I'I'ER.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.662
- AU PAIR.
- OKAY, THAT WORD IS
SO "BOUGIE." PLEASE.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.658
OKAY, NAN NY,
WHATEVER.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.034
THIS IS L.A.
EVERYBODY HAS
LIVE-IN HELP.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.437
I DON'T KNOW.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.805
ARE YOU MAD--
I MEAN, THAT I CAN'T HELP
YOU AS MUCH ANYMORE?

10:18.910 --> 10:20.946
- TELL ME.
- DON'T.

10:21.050 --> 10:23.245
EVERYTHING YOU EVER
WANTED IS COMING TRUE.

10:23.350 --> 10:26.148
IT'S JUST A STUPID SITCOM.
I'M SURE IT WILL GET
CANCELED.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.309
I JUST-- I DON'T WANT IT
TO BE WEIRD FOR YOU,

10:28.420 --> 10:31.389
YOU KNOW, HAVING A STRANGER
IN THE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY
FROM SASKATCHEWAN.

10:31.490 --> 10:35.620
- WHERE THE HELL
IS SASKATCHEWAN?
- NEAR CALGARY, I THINK.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.721
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH--

10:37.830 --> 10:40.537
SHE CAN HAVE HORNS
AND WEIGH 300 LBS.
FOR ALL I CARE.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.167
AS LONG AS SHE BRINGS IN
THE WATER BOTTLES, CAN BE HERE
WHEN THE CABLE GUY COMES

10:44.270 --> 10:46.500
AND STARTS PUTTING AWAY
THE GROCERIES THAT
ARE MELTING

10:46.610 --> 10:50.102
WHILE I'M GETTING
THE REST OUT OF THE CAR.
I JUST NEED ANOTHER ADULT.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.148
( Sarah sobbing )

11:03.430 --> 11:05.125
SARAH?

11:08.230 --> 11:12.394
OH, RUTHY, YOU NEVER GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.333
FIONA'S DEAD.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.908
- FIONA?
- CLIMBING.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.832
I KNOW YOU HATED HER
FOR WHAT SHE DID TO NATE.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.374
BUT WE'VE LOST HER, RUTHY.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.072
SHE'S GONE.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.319
( sobbing )

11:33.660 --> 11:37.221
- I KNOW, IT'S HORRENDOUS.
- George: Jesus,
I can't imagine.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.890
- THERE WAS NOTHING
SHE COULD DO?
- No, nothing.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.389
FELL HUNDREDS OF FEET RIGHT DOWN
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE,

11:42.500 --> 11:45.867
AND WAS DEAD
WHEN THEY PULLED HER OUT.
I'M JUST SICK ABOUT IT.

11:45.970 --> 11:48.939
FIONA WAS A VERY CLOSE
FRIEND OF MINE.
VERY CLOSE.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.201
You sure you don't need me
to come over there?

11:51.310 --> 11:53.801
I THINK SARAH'S IN SHOCK.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.071
IT'S NOT A PRETTY SCENE
DOWN HERE...

11:56.180 --> 11:59.547
ONLY APPROPRIATE
FOR FAMILY-- OF ORIGIN.

11:59.650 --> 12:03.381
PEOPLE--
I NEED PEOPLE.
WHO CAN WE CALL?

12:03.490 --> 12:06.141
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
- SHE'S JUST JABBERING.
SHE'S INCOHERENT.

12:06.250 --> 12:10.084
- Keep me posted.
- OKAY. BYE.

12:10.190 --> 12:13.899
GET ME MY PHONE BOOK.
IT'S IN MY SATCHEL.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.766
I NEED
TO CIRCLE THE WAGONS.

12:21.270 --> 12:24.307
David:
DO I NEED TO COME DOWN THERE?

12:24.410 --> 12:27.971
OKAY OKAY, I'LL STOP BY
THE OFFICE WHEN I COME
TO PICK THE BOYS UP.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.729
BYE.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.478
DURRELL PULLED
A FIRE ALARM.

12:32.580 --> 12:36.311
NOW I HAVE
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE PRINCIPAL.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.547
I CAN'T TELL KEITH.

12:38.650 --> 12:42.450
HE'S JUST LOOKING
FOR MORE PROOF THESE KIDS
ARE TOO MESSED UP FOR US.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.358
- THE FOSTER'S
JUST TEMPORARY, RIGHT?
- NO, NOT REALLY.

12:45.460 --> 12:49.294
THEY TRY TO GET THEM
IN THE RIGHT PLACE, HAVE IT
LEAD TO ACTUAL ADOPTION.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.560
THAT'S THE IDEAL.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.399
- YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM?
- ( SlghS )

12:52.500 --> 12:54.058
I DO.

12:54.170 --> 12:57.606
ANTHONY'S SO CUTE
I'D KEEP HIM IN A HEARTBEAT.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.031
DURRELL, ON THE OTHER HAND,
IS A MESS.

13:00.140 --> 13:02.779
BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT?
THESE KIDS COME FROM
A BROKEN HOME.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.202
THEIR DAD BASICALLY
ABANDONED THEM.

13:06.310 --> 13:08.471
SORRY.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.743
IT'S OKAY.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.886
HEY, DID I TELL YOU
I FOUND MY OWN PLACE?

13:13.990 --> 13:16.515
A TWO BEDROOM.
I'M WAITING TO HEAR.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.485
THEN MY BOYS CAN STAY OVER.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.094
I CAN'T WAIT
TO WAKE UP WITH THEM AGAIN.
THAT'S WHAT I MISS.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.523
PAJAMAS, AND MESSY HAIR
AND THEIR EYES ALL SLEEPY.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.839
WELL, I HOPE YOU
GET THE PLACE,

13:29.940 --> 13:32.306
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.401
WHAT I WANT...

13:34.510 --> 13:36.637
IS TO BE BACK HOME.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.901
BUT I HAVE
TO TAKE IN THE REALITY

13:39.010 --> 13:41.547
THAT IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

13:44.820 --> 13:48.984
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.
I WAS RUSHING AROUND
THIS MORNING.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.853
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO PICK UP.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.589
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T
HAVE TO CLEAN FOR ME.
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.691
I'M SO EXCITED.
I LOVE CALIFORNIA.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.564
- I PRACTICALLY
BARFED ON THE PLANE.
- WELL, DON'T DO THAT.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.639
- Julio: CAN SHE
COME IN MY ROOM?
- YEAH, HOLD ON, JULIO.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.537
UH, SO I WROTE UP A LIST.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.076
SOME OF IT IS COMMON SENSE--
DO THE DISHES WHEN THEY
START PILING UP.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.001
AND IF YOU COULD BE HERE
TOMORROW BETWEEN 10:00
AND 2:00,

14:11.110 --> 14:13.977
THE CABLE GUY'S COMING
'CAUSE OUR SATELLITE'S OUT.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.173
OH, DO YOU HAVE THOSE GIANT
WATER BOTTLES IN CANADA?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.441
- YEAH.
- THEY'RE WAY
TOO HEAW FOR ME.

14:18.550 --> 14:21.110
SO IF YOU EVER SEE THAT
IT'S EMPTY, GO AHEAD
AND BRING ONE IN.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.448
OH, OKAY.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.087
UM, WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I GOT A LITTLE
SETTLED IN FIRST?

14:26.190 --> 14:28.522
OH MY GOD.
OF COURSE.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.359
- I'M SORRY. I'M--
- OH!

14:30.470 --> 14:34.190
- --JUST REALLY
HAPPY YOU'RE HERE.
- HELP IS ON THE WAY.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.936
OH, HERE'S THE E-MAIL
THAT'S FROM FIONA'S
ARTIST WEEK GROUP.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.008
MM, I'LL CALL THEM
FROM MY HOUSE.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.078
SHOULD WE REGROUP
IN THE MORNING?

14:44.180 --> 14:46.774
SURE.
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
TONIGHT.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.814
GEORGE AND I ARE
IN TRANSITION MODE.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.946
YOU SOUNDED LIKE
YOU WERE TOGETHER
WHEN YOU WERE ON THE PHONE.

14:52.050 --> 14:55.087
YOU THREW THE BUM OUT
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET
HIS SHIT TOGETHER?

14:55.190 --> 14:57.681
NO, I MADE A PLAN
WITH MY NEW FRIENDS
AT KNITTING.

14:57.790 --> 14:59.428
FIRST, GET SET HIM UP
IN HIS OWN PLACE,

14:59.530 --> 15:01.896
SORT OF PAD THE LANDING,
AS IT WERE, AND THEN--

15:02.000 --> 15:04.321
PARACH UTE
OUT OF THERE?

15:05.900 --> 15:08.368
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.030
CUT TO YOU
30 YEARS FROM NOW
CHANGING HIS DIAPERS

15:11.140 --> 15:13.574
AND DOWNING A GALLON
OF MERLOT EVERY DAY.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.477
( door opens )

15:15.580 --> 15:19.949
OH, CLAIRE,
YOUR AUNT SARAH'S DEAR FRIEND
FIONA WAS KILLED TODAY.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.075
- SOMEONENKCI)LLED HER?

15:22.180 --> 15:24.648
SHE FELL OF A CLIFF
IN TOPANGA CANYON.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.218
OH MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.288
YOU MET HER
AT THE FULL MOON
CELEBRATION--

15:29.390 --> 15:31.688
FIONA KLEINSCHMIDT,
THE CERAMICIST.

15:31.790 --> 15:34.293
YEAH, SHE WROTE ME
A RECOMMENDATION
FOR ART SCHOOL.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.699
AND SHE KNEW DAD...
AND NATE?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.222
UH, YES, THAT'S THE ONE.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.332
SO WHO GETS TO SPEAK
AT THE SERVICE

15:41.440 --> 15:44.603
ABOUT FIONA'S PENCHANT
FOR USHERING YOUNG BOYS
INTO MANHOOD?

15:44.710 --> 15:48.874
- BETTINA, THAT WAS ONCE.
- HEY, THAT'S THE ONE THING
I REALLY ADMIRED HER FOR.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.868
THE OLD TABLE'S BACK.

15:50.980 --> 15:54.575
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?
THE OTHER TABLE JUST DIDN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE IN HERE.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.478
GEORGE HAS IT.
HE MOVED OUT, BUTI DON'T
WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

15:57.590 --> 16:01.014
YOUR AUNT SARAH NEEDS
OUR HELP NOW.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.849
HOW ARE YOU, CLAIRE?

16:02.960 --> 16:05.520
WELL, I HAD
TO START TEMPING.

16:05.630 --> 16:08.849
BUT ONLY UNTIL I HEAR FROM
THIS EMERGING ARTISTS' GRANT
THAT I APPLIED FOR.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.829
BUT WHAT REALLY SUCKS
IS I HAD TO WASTE MY MONEY
ON THESE RIDICULOUS CLOTHES.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.692
- ( chuckles )
- OH.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.404
Bettina:
OH MY GOD.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.705
"YET TH ESE ARE ALL
STILL CHESS MOVES.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.438
EVEN BEING MAD AT YOU TODAY
IS STILL A CHESS MOVE.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.247
WHAT I HATE THE MOST IS
THE GAME BEING PLAYED."

16:25.350 --> 16:27.671
OKAY, LET ME GET
HER RESPONSE.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.684
OKAY,
MAYA IS DOWN.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.554
- OKAY, THIS IS WHAT
SHE WROTE BACK.
- Brenda: MM-HMM.

16:35.660 --> 16:40.427
( chuckles )
"SADLY, I NEVER LEARNED
TO PLAY CHESS,

16:40.530 --> 16:43.328
SO BE ASSURED I'M NOT
MAKING A MOVE."

16:43.430 --> 16:47.332
NOW WHY WOULD SHE PUT
"SADLY" IF SHE DIDN'T FEEL
AT LEAST SOME...

16:47.440 --> 16:52.002
UNCONSCIOUS REGRET
FOR THE WAY THINGS ENDED?

16:52.110 --> 16:55.204
THERE IS NO WAY TWO PEOPLE
COULD HAVE GONE THROUGH

16:55.310 --> 16:58.609
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH TOGETHER
AND JUST LET IT-- UNLESS--

16:58.710 --> 17:01.577
WAIT, LET ME
READ YOU THE TRANSCRIPTS
FROM OUR I.M.s

17:01.680 --> 17:03.580
NO!

17:03.690 --> 17:07.683
WELL, NATE,
HAVE YOU ASKED HER
WHAT SHE'S THINKING?

17:07.790 --> 17:09.587
CLEARLY SHE'S MOVED ON.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.920
TO BE HONEST,
THE ONLY REASON
I'M DEALING WITH YOU

17:12.030 --> 17:15.329
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE
AND YOU'RE NOT OUT HERE
STALKING MY SISTER.

17:15.430 --> 17:16.897
NATE! STOP.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.026
- SORRY.
- NO, I'M SORRY.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.937
I'M ON MY MEDICATION.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.258
IT'S JUST GONNA
TAKE AWHILE.

17:25.370 --> 17:28.407
THE END OF A RELATIONSHIP
IS HARD FOR ANYONE.

17:28.510 --> 17:32.276
- I REMEMBER WHEN YOU TWO--
- BILLY, PLEASE DON'T!

17:34.750 --> 17:36.377
( sighs )

17:36.480 --> 17:38.448
I'M SORRY.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.811
( sighs )
I'LL JUST--

17:41.920 --> 17:45.481
DID YOU GUYS SAY YOU HAD
THAT SCORSESE THING TIVO'd?

17:47.030 --> 17:48.952
I'LL JUST EAT
SOME ICE CREAM.

17:49.060 --> 17:51.699
THEN I'LL WATCH IT
AND THEN HEAD OUT.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.093
AND I WON'T CALL HER.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.575
I KILLED HER.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.718
I KILLED MY BEST FRIEND.

18:08.820 --> 18:11.482
- Bettina: HONEY,
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER.
- OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.911
YOU ALWAYS TELL ME
EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

18:14.020 --> 18:16.784
OH, FUCK OFF!

18:16.890 --> 18:19.279
FUCK THAT ONE
TO THE GROUND!

18:19.390 --> 18:22.154
"EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON."
WHAT A CROCK!

18:22.260 --> 18:25.058
YOU SAY THERE'S A REASON
GRANDMA LOST HER LEGS,

18:25.170 --> 18:27.934
AND THERE'S A REASON
THERE'S A WAR.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.632
AND TSUNAMIS?

18:29.740 --> 18:33.301
AND THERE'S A REASON
GEORGE-FUCKING-BUSH
GOT REELECTED!

18:33.410 --> 18:37.471
SHIT GOES WRONG
BECAUSE THERE'S EVIL
IN THE WORLD, LIKE ME!

18:37.580 --> 18:40.048
- I'M EVIL.
- SARAH, NO!

18:40.150 --> 18:43.779
- LET HER GO.
- IT WAS MY IDEA
TO GO GET HER

18:43.890 --> 18:45.312
TO GO ON THE WALK.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.559
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.982
I... I DRAGGED HER.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.194
SHE TURNED ME DOWN TWICE.
I BEGGED HER.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.827
- ( softly ) TWICE?
- WHO AM I, THE ANTICHRIST?

18:56.930 --> 18:58.921
SOME ONE SHOULD...

18:59.030 --> 19:01.794
JUST LOCK ME UP
AND KEEP ME IN A CAGE.

19:01.900 --> 19:05.108
SOMEONE SHOULD DIG A HOLE
AND THROW ME IN IT,

19:05.210 --> 19:07.474
NOT LET ME OUT!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.901
( wailing )

19:19.220 --> 19:21.279
OH MY GOD!

19:21.390 --> 19:23.324
IT'S A PLAYSTATION 2!

19:23.430 --> 19:27.150
- Anthony: COOL.
- WITH TURISMO 4!

19:27.260 --> 19:30.127
- CAN WE-- CAN WE HOOK IT UP?
- OF COURSE!

19:30.230 --> 19:32.494
BUT WE HAVE TO LEAVE
FOR SCHOOL IN 10 MINUTES!

19:32.600 --> 19:35.535
- ALL RIGHT!
- Anthony: OKAY!

19:35.640 --> 19:38.700
WHAT?
IT'S JUST A PLAYSTATION.
ALL KIDS HAVE THEM.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.370
I JUST THINK BUYING THIS
WITHOUT ANY RHYME OR REASON

19:41.480 --> 19:44.369
IS LIKE SAYING
THEY DESERVE A PRIZE,
WHEN CLEARLY THEY DON'T.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.916
IT'S NOT A PRIZE.
IT'S JUST SOMETHING FUN
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.647
YEAH, GOOD TIMES.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.810
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING,
MISS POLLYANNA.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.253
- IT'S TO GIVE THEM AN ACTIVITY.
- IT'S GOING TO ROT
THEIR BRAINS.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.757
WHO KNOWS?

19:59.860 --> 20:01.521
I DON'T.

20:01.630 --> 20:05.669
I DON'T EITHER.
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE
EVERYONE HAPPY.

20:05.770 --> 20:08.762
MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
YOU'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE
EVERYBODY SO DAMNED HAPPY.

20:08.870 --> 20:12.636
- WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING--
- OH GOD, JUST SHUT
THE FUCK UP.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.402
( Durrell and Anthony
Playing )

20:22.380 --> 20:24.519
ARE WE
HAVING FUN YET?

20:24.620 --> 20:27.043
OH. HEY.

20:27.150 --> 20:28.708
SHH.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.583
HERE'S BEVERLY'S
BIRTHDAY CARD TO SIGN.

20:30.690 --> 20:33.955
- OH, I HAVEN'T MET BEVERLY.
- YEAH.

20:34.060 --> 20:37.564
SHE WON'T EVEN READ IT.
LAST YEAR I SIGNED IT "HITLER,"
SHE NEVER SAID A WORD.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.162
- HEY, JOHNNY,
HAVE YOU MET CLAIRE YET?
- YEAH, BABY.

20:41.270 --> 20:44.034
- OH, HI.
- "WAZZUP"?

20:44.140 --> 20:46.438
OH, JUST TRYING
TO SIGN THIS CARD.

20:46.540 --> 20:50.101
HE WASN'T REALLY ASKING.
HE HAS TOURETTE'S, YOU HAVE
TO SAY IT BACK TO HIM.

20:50.210 --> 20:53.373
OH. WHAT'S UP?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.778
BEVERLY'S COMING.
GIVE ME BACK THE CARD.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.541
HURRY UP!

21:00.150 --> 21:03.187
YOU CAN SIGN IT LATER.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.758
SO, I DON'T THINK I'LL
GET HOME FOR A FEW DAYS.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.454
DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT
OR SHOULD I CALL KOO KOO ROO
FOR YOU?

21:08.560 --> 21:12.269
OKAY.
I'LL CHECK IN SOON.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.198
WAS I FROTHING
LIKE AN IDIOT
LAST NIG?

21:16.300 --> 21:20.475
SOMETHING IN RED WINE
DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.605
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

21:22.710 --> 21:25.599
- YOU WERE BLAMING YOURSELF.
- I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT.

21:25.710 --> 21:28.315
IT'S SO NARCISSISTIC,
YOU KNOW.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.808
I AM THE ASSHOLE AT THE CENTER
OF THE UNIVERSE,

21:32.920 --> 21:36.219
FORGETTING HOW VAST
THE UNIVERSE IS,

21:36.320 --> 21:38.788
AND HOW NOTHING...

21:38.890 --> 21:41.256
IS IN OUR CONTROL.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.660
AN IDEA BOTH TERRIFYING
AND BEAUTIFUL

21:45.770 --> 21:47.829
AS SPIRIT ITSELF.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.932
Woman:
HOOTY-HOO,

21:51.040 --> 21:55.477

22:30.280 --> 22:32.805
TELL THE WHOLE STORY.
LAKSHMI HEARD FIONA

22:32.910 --> 22:35.913
DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO GO ON THE HIKE.
SOMEONE PUSHED HER INTO IT?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.883
Nate:
SOME WOMAN NAMED SUSIE BRIGHT.
HEARD OF HER?

22:39.990 --> 22:41.912

I LOVE HER.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.080

22:46.190 --> 22:49.398

22:56.800 --> 22:58.904

22:59.010 --> 23:02.673
You really want to meet
Ms. Bright, huh?

23:02.780 --> 23:05.772
YEAH, AND GET AWAY

23:05.880 --> 23:08.769

23:13.250 --> 23:16.117
- WHOA.
- David: YEP.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.223
FIRST WOMAN
YOU EVER SLEPT WITH.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.821
FOR REAL?

23:21.930 --> 23:24.524
FOR REAL.

23:24.630 --> 23:28.691
I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D SEE HER NAKED AGAIN.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.789
Rico: YEAH.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.834
HEY, HOW HAS SHE
HELD UP?

23:31.940 --> 23:35.603
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
ON HER 20 YEARS LATER?

23:37.310 --> 23:38.902
IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED

23:39.010 --> 23:42.468
SHE'S ALL
BRUISED AND BUSTED UP,
YOU FUCKING IDIOT!

23:51.260 --> 23:55.048
HEY, CLAIRE,
DID YOU COME ACROSS
THOSE REQUISITION PRINTOUTS?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.094
OH...

24:01.640 --> 24:03.938
MAY I HUG YOU?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.630
OKAY.

24:13.150 --> 24:15.539
OH, CLAIRE.

24:15.650 --> 24:18.710
LISTEN, I KNOW THIS PLACE
CAN BE REALLY INTIMIDATING.

24:18.820 --> 24:21.380
18 YEARS AGO IT WAS
MY AFTER-SCHOOL JOB,

24:21.490 --> 24:23.526
AND I JUST FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE PLACE.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.586
THE MONDAY AFTER I GRADUATED
FROM COLLEGE

24:25.690 --> 24:28.193
I CAME BACK AND I SAID,
"PUT ME TO WORK."

24:28.300 --> 24:30.791
IT REALLY IS VERY SPECIAL.

24:33.030 --> 24:36.534
WHAT'S THE MATTER, CLAIRE?
IT IS KIRSTEN, IS SHE
BEING A BUTT?

24:36.640 --> 24:39.905
OH NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST...

24:42.240 --> 24:44.174
IT'S JUST THESE PANTYHOSE.

24:44.280 --> 24:47.044
OH, DO YOU HAVE A RUN?
'CAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE
CLEAR POLISH

24:47.150 --> 24:49.209
- YOU CAN PUT ON--
- NO NO, IT'S NOT THAT!

24:49.320 --> 24:52.517
IT'S THEY'RE LIKE
SQUEEZING AGAINST MY TORSO
AND I CAN'T EVEN BREATHE!

24:52.620 --> 24:54.713
I MEAN, NONE OF THIS WORK
WOULD EVEN SEEM THAT HARD

24:54.820 --> 24:56.583
IF I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
I WAS SITTING HERE

24:56.690 --> 24:58.681
IN SOME KIND OF
TORTURE CHAMBER
ALL DAY.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.590
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
A DIFFERENT BRAND.
MINE ENERGIZE ME.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.294
NO, '5 NOT THE BRAND.
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.061
IT'S-- I MEAN...

25:07.170 --> 25:09.764
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW HAVING YOUR LEGS

25:09.870 --> 25:12.600
SHEATHED
IN THIS SMOOTH PLASTIC
BARBIE LEG,

25:12.710 --> 25:14.598
LIKE, ENCASED
IN A SAUSAGE CASING

25:14.710 --> 25:16.803
WOULD HELP YOU DO
YOUR JOB BETTER.

25:16.910 --> 25:19.470
DOESN'T SEEM SEXIST
THAT IT'S A REGULATION
ONLY FOR WOMEN?

25:19.580 --> 25:21.878
MEN HAVE TO WEAR TIES.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.483
RIGHT, BUT THEY DON'T
SUFFOCATE YOU.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.888
AND IT'S NOT ON THEIR PENIS.

25:28.690 --> 25:31.079
I'M GONNA GO WASH OUT
SOME MUGS.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.656
* SHE'S A BRICK,
BA BA BA NA *

25:35.760 --> 25:37.728
* HOUSE,
BA BA BA NA *

25:37.830 --> 25:39.821
* SHE'S A MIGHTY,
MIGHTY-- *

25:39.930 --> 25:42.398
I'M GONNA PUT
THE MUSIC UNDERNEATH,
BUT I HAVE TO GET THE BEAT.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.434
I'M OKAY.
SO ZOOM IN, ZOOM IN.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.168
ARE YOU ZOOMING?
* LETTIN' ALL HANG OUT

25:47.270 --> 25:50.034
- * OH, SHE'S A BRICK,
BA BA BA NA, HOUSE-- *
- HEY!

25:50.140 --> 25:53.303
- HI.
- ARE YOU GUYS
MAKING A MOVIE?

25:53.410 --> 25:56.311
WE WERE PLAYING ONLINE,
AND I FOUND THE APPLICATION
TO "SURVIVOR."

25:56.420 --> 25:59.548
IT SAID YOU HAD
TO MAKE AN AUDITION TAPE,
SO JULIO GOT THE CAMERA.

25:59.650 --> 26:02.756
- THAT'S FUN.
- I HAVE GOT THE WHOLE
FOREIGN THING GOING FOR ME,

26:02.860 --> 26:04.828
BEING FROM CANADA
AND ALL.

26:04.930 --> 26:08.491
OH, BUT WE CAN DO IT LATER.
JULIO, GO GET WHAT WE MADE.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.488
SO SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.158
- PUT YOUR FEET UP.
- OH. REALLY?

26:12.270 --> 26:14.363
YEAH, REALLY.

26:14.470 --> 26:17.803
MOMMY'S WORKED SO HARD.
THAT IS SO NICE OF YOU,
JULIO.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.209
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, DONNA.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

26:21.310 --> 26:23.335
OH, I LOVE HELPING PEOPLE.

26:23.440 --> 26:27.069
AND I KNOW YOU DO
EVERYTHING BY YOURSELF.
MY MOM WAS A SINGLE MOM.

26:27.180 --> 26:30.980
IT'S NOT ONLY
TWICE AS HARD WITHOUT A MAN,
IT'S EXPONENTIALLY HARDER.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.787
WAS HE GOOD TO YOU.
DID HE TAKE CARE OF YOU?

26:36.890 --> 26:39.324
YES, HE WAS GOOD TO ME.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.955
AND THEN HE WAS
REALLY BAD TO ME.

26:42.730 --> 26:45.995
( Anthony sobbing )

26:52.410 --> 26:54.878
DURRELL BROKE IT.

26:54.980 --> 26:58.541
I DID NOT! IT WOULDN'T
LET ME GET TO LEVEL TWO
SO I HAD TO FIX IT.

26:58.650 --> 27:01.016
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO OPEN IT.
- CRYBABY CRYBABY.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.044
- WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO, DURRELL?
- IT BROKE!

27:04.150 --> 27:05.947
OKAY, I BROKE IT!

27:06.050 --> 27:08.484
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BUY US
A PRESENT THAT YOU KNEW
WAS GONNA BREAK?

27:08.590 --> 27:12.287
YOU OPENED THE MACHINE UP.
I'D HAVE GOTTEN IT FIXED
HAD YOU ONLY WAITED.

27:12.390 --> 27:16.099
- WHY DOES EVERYTHING
ALWAYS HAVE TO GET RUINED?
- EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY RUINED

27:16.200 --> 27:18.964
FROM THE TIME WE HAD TO MOVE
INTO THIS STUPID GAY HOUSE!

27:19.070 --> 27:20.935
- DURRELL, YOU'RE
GOING TO YOUR ROOM!
- GET OFF OF ME!

27:21.040 --> 27:23.395
Anthony:
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
I HATE YOU!

27:23.500 --> 27:24.967
- GET OFF ME!
- LEAVE HIM ALONE!

27:25.070 --> 27:27.732
Anthony:
STOP IT, YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK HIS ARM!

27:27.840 --> 27:29.876
- KEITH!
- STOP! YOU'RE HURTING HIM!

27:29.980 --> 27:31.868
Durrell:
I SAID, GET OFF OF ME!

27:31.980 --> 27:33.914
David:
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

27:34.020 --> 27:36.909
DURRELL'S GETTING
A TIME-OUT!

27:37.020 --> 27:39.181
- ( slams at door )
- YOU'RE LOCKING THEM
IN A ROOM?

27:39.290 --> 27:41.588
THESE KIDS WILL
WALK ALL OVER YOU
IF YOU LET THEM.

27:41.690 --> 27:44.818
- I'LL BEAT YOU, MAN!
- MORE VIOLENCE, THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO SHOW THEM?

27:44.930 --> 27:47.057
DISCIPLINE AND VIOLENCE
ARE NOT THE SAME THING.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.958
- I'LL KILL YOU, YOU FAGGOT!
- LET US OUT OF HERE,
YOU FAGGOT!

27:50.060 --> 27:51.869
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
KEITH, LOOK AT YOURSELF!

27:51.970 --> 27:53.892
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
INSANE RIGHT NOW.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.366
Durrell:
LET GO OF THE DOOR
OR I'LL TELL D.C.F.S.!

27:56.470 --> 27:59.359
YOU THINK ANYBODY
OVER THERE GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT YOU?

27:59.470 --> 28:02.371
( boys grunt)

28:02.480 --> 28:04.300
YOU DID THAT TO YOURSELVES!

28:05.910 --> 28:07.400
( breathing heavily)

28:09.380 --> 28:12.281
( "You Light Up My Life"
Muzak playing )

28:22.500 --> 28:24.695
( humming to Muzak)

28:25.730 --> 28:29.769
* ADRIFT ON THE WATER

28:29.870 --> 28:33.909
* COULD IT BE ACTUALLY

28:34.010 --> 28:37.400
* WEARING THESE CLOTHES

28:37.510 --> 28:41.571
* I'VE NEVER BEEN

28:41.680 --> 28:45.389
* THIS FUCKING UNCOMFORTABLE

28:45.490 --> 28:48.812
* NEVER AGAIN

28:48.920 --> 28:54.051
* TO WEAR PANTYHOSE...

28:54.160 --> 29:00.395
* 'CAUSE YOU RIDE UP
MY THIGHS *

29:00.500 --> 29:03.958
* YOU'RE TIGHT ON MY ASS

29:04.070 --> 29:07.779
* YOU CLIMB UP MY CROTCH

29:07.880 --> 29:11.873
* YOU RUIN MY DAY

29:11.980 --> 29:16.041
* AND FILL MY SOUL

29:16.150 --> 29:19.938
* YOU FILL MY SOUL
WITH HATE *

29:20.050 --> 29:23.508
* IT CAN'T BE RIGHT

29:23.620 --> 29:29.627
* WHEN THEY FEEL SO TIGHT...

29:29.730 --> 29:30.754
* WHOO

29:30.870 --> 29:33.168
* 'CAUSE YOU AND YOU AND YOU

29:33.270 --> 29:35.397
- * ALL OF YOU...
- CLAIRE?

29:35.500 --> 29:38.537
* RIDE UP MY THIGHS.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.505
CLAIRE?

29:40.610 --> 29:44.376
IS MY MUSIC TOO LOUD?
DO YOU NEED ME
TO TURN IT DOWN?

29:44.480 --> 29:48.177
- OH, YEAH,
MAYBE A LITTLE. THANKS.
- ( Muzak ends)

29:50.120 --> 29:52.418
- ( doorbell rings )
- COMING!

29:56.590 --> 29:58.455
- HI, DADDY.
- SWEETHEART.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.027
OH, BOY.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.291
- HERE.
HAPPY HOUSEWARMING.
- OOH, BEAUTIFUL.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.368
( clinking )

30:05.330 --> 30:07.696
TEA'S READY!

30:07.800 --> 30:10.291
WHERE DOES RUTH KEEP
HER HAND LOTION?

30:10.400 --> 30:11.628
I DON'T KNOW.

30:11.740 --> 30:13.332
IT'S BEEN SO DRY
OUT THIS WEEK,

30:13.440 --> 30:15.874
AND THE ONLY STUFF IN
THE BATHROOM'S YOURS.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.198
MAYBE SHE TOOK IT
WITH HER.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.341
- TOOK IT WHERE?
- EARL GREY OR GREEN?

30:24.450 --> 30:26.918
- WHEN DID YOU MOVE IN?
- TWO DAYS AGO.

30:27.020 --> 30:29.557
STOP BEING SO NOSY.
EARL GREY OR GREEN?

30:29.660 --> 30:32.481
DADDY, I'M NOT,
I JUST--

30:32.590 --> 30:34.353
GREEN.

30:35.730 --> 30:37.152
SO I GUESS...

30:37.260 --> 30:40.718
YOU GUYS ARE JUST
TAKING YOUR TIME
UNPACKING?

30:40.830 --> 30:42.388
MM-HMM.

30:44.070 --> 30:49.098
LOOK, I RELY
ON RUTH TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU, DADDY.

30:50.910 --> 30:52.673
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

30:52.780 --> 30:54.975
WE'RE FINE.

30:55.080 --> 30:59.619
THE ONLY REASON I'M ALONE IS
THAT RUTH'S SISTER WAS INVOLVED
IN A FATAL ACCIDENT.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.119
- OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.
- MM.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.108
EVIDENTLY, SHE'S BEING
BLAMED FOR IT.

31:03.220 --> 31:07.327
AND RUTH,
CARETAKER THAT SHE IS,
IS BY HER SIDE.

31:07.430 --> 31:10.354
APPARENTLY
SHE'S QUITE DISTRAUGHT.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.099
( women laughing )

31:13.200 --> 31:15.088
I THINK THEY'VE OUTLIVED
THEIR USEFULNESS.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.929
- MEN ARE OBSOLETE.
- Woman: IT'S TRUE.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.168
I FEEL MORE OF A CONNECTION
TO MY WOMEN FRIENDS THAN
ANY OF MY HUSBANDS.

31:20.270 --> 31:23.137
I'VE WANTED TO HAVE
AN ALL-WOMEN WEEKEND
ON MY LAND.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.049
- ( women gasp )
- NICE IDEA.

31:25.150 --> 31:27.243
LET'S MAKE IT
AN ALL-WOMAN YEAR!

31:27.350 --> 31:30.376
ALL WOMEN FOREVER!
A LAND OF NO MEN!

31:30.480 --> 31:33.210
( laughter, cheering )

31:33.320 --> 31:35.959
MEN CAN VISIT,
BUT ONLY FOR A WEEKEND.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.028
JUST TO SATISFY OUR NEEDS.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.257
BUT THEY HAVE TO BRING MONEY.

31:40.360 --> 31:43.921
I'VE GOT THE LAND, LADIES.
THERE'S 20 ACRES UP THERE
I DON'T USE AT ALL.

31:44.030 --> 31:46.521
WE'LL BUY YURTS
OFF THE INTERNET.

31:46.630 --> 31:47.767
SAVE ME A YURT.

31:47.870 --> 31:50.737
BRENDA, WE COULD MIDWIFE
YOUR BABY FOR YOU.

31:50.840 --> 31:52.762
YOU CAN DELIVER HER
IN A HORSE TROUGH.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.179
AND WE CAMP WHILE
YOU'RE IN LABOR.
MMM.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.907
I KNOW HOW TO GROW
VEGETABLES!

31:57.010 --> 31:58.739
WE'LL ONLYAT WHAT
I CAN GROW OR KILL.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.547
- NO MEN!
- ( screams )

32:04.650 --> 32:07.710
- NO MEN!
- ( laughing )

32:07.820 --> 32:10.482
I'M JUST HERE
TO PICK UP MY KID.

32:10.590 --> 32:13.024
THAT'S IT!
WE'LL USE THE MEN
FOR CHILD CARE,

32:13.130 --> 32:15.655
LIKE THEY'VE DONE TO US
FOR A GAZILLION YEARS.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.797
I'M MOVING IN
TO AN ALL-GIRL COMMUNE.
DON'T WORRY,

32:18.900 --> 32:20.458
I'LL SNEAK YOU IN
WHEN THEY'RE ASLEEP.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.368
- OKAY. UP UP UP.
- YEAH, DO YOU MIND
IF I STAY?

32:23.470 --> 32:25.506
- THIS IS KIND OF COOL.
- SURE. NO PROBLEM.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.760
Brenda:
BYE-BYE!

32:27.870 --> 32:29.178
- BYE!
- Bettina: BYE.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.304
BYE.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.640
- BYE, BEAUTIFUL.
- HAVE FUN, EVERYBODY.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.946
OKAY, WHO'S GOT WEED?

32:39.050 --> 32:40.779
Brenda: NOT ME.

32:40.890 --> 32:42.858
MINE'S ALL GONE.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.622
I THINK I KNOW WHERE
I'VE GOT SOME.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.299
I'M DONE.

32:58.410 --> 33:02.471
- WITH YOUR FLOSSING OR--?
- WITH THE KIDS.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.208
KEITH, IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE SLIPPERS YOU CAN

33:05.310 --> 33:08.074
RETURN TO NEIMAN MARCUS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T FIT.

33:08.180 --> 33:10.114
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT
OF FOSTER--

33:10.220 --> 33:12.279
SO YOU CAN SEE
WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.187
THAT'S WHAT
THE SOCIAL WORKER SAID.

33:14.290 --> 33:16.155
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT WORKING.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.251
- WE'RE JUST GEN15TING STARTED.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.885
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS.
THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
TO KNOW.

33:20.990 --> 33:22.992
WE SHOULD STOP
BEFORE THEY BOND TO US.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.590
BUT I'VE ALREADY
BONDED TO THEM.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.260
WHAT YOU'VE BONDED TO
IS THE IDEA OF BECOMING
YOUR MOTHER--

33:27.370 --> 33:29.429
JUST RUNNING AROUND HERE
BLIND TO EVERYTHING.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.304
- "OH, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY."
- SHH!

33:32.410 --> 33:35.129
AND YOU TURN INTO YOUR FATHER--
SOLVE EVERYTHING WITH A BEATING?

33:35.240 --> 33:37.379
- I HAVEN'T
TOUCHED THOSE KIDS!
- YOU WERE CLOSE.

33:37.480 --> 33:40.449
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY
WHEN THE SOCIAL WORKER
COMES TOMORROW

33:40.550 --> 33:43.144
I'LL BE EXPLAINING TO HER
THAT THIS IS A BAD MATCH.

33:43.250 --> 33:46.686
- ( groans )
- YOU SHOULD PACK THEIR THINGS
IN THE MORNING.

33:50.090 --> 33:51.728
HOW CAN YOU
JUST ABANDON THEM

33:51.830 --> 33:55.027
WHEN THEIR LITTLE LIVES
HAVE ALREADY BEEN FILLED
WITH SO MUCH TRAUMA?

33:55.130 --> 33:57.928
GOOD,
SO NOW YOU ABANDON ME?

33:58.030 --> 34:00.169
THAT SOLVES EVERYTHING.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.798
( sighs )

34:02.900 --> 34:05.164
( lullaby playing )

34:08.810 --> 34:10.471
( cell phone ringing )

34:14.780 --> 34:16.418
( whispers )
HELLO?

34:16.520 --> 34:17.669
HEY, IT'S MAGGIE.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.509
Hey.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.009
I WAS JUST PUTTING
MAYA TO SLEEP.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.008
Have you seen
your mother?

34:24.130 --> 34:27.486
UM, WHY DO YOU ASK?

34:27.590 --> 34:31.265
WELL, I WAS
JUST OVER AT MY DAD'S,
AND SHE WASN'T THERE.

34:31.370 --> 34:34.589
AND THEN I TRIED
TO REACH HER AT THE HOUSE
AND NOBODY ANSWERED.

34:35.670 --> 34:37.262
HUH.
WELL, I, UM...

34:37.370 --> 34:40.203
Nate, we don't know
each other very well,

34:40.310 --> 34:43.074
BUT DO SOMETHING
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

34:43.180 --> 34:45.842
AND I'LL MAKE
THE SAME PROMISE TO YOU.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.447
NEVER LIE TO ME.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.381
Okay?

34:54.960 --> 34:57.212
OKAY.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.552
SHE'S AT THE HOUSE.

34:59.660 --> 35:03.926
UM, IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF WOMEN.
THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE PARTY.

35:04.030 --> 35:05.998
BUT SHE'S FINE.

35:06.100 --> 35:09.888
If there's a problem
with your dad, she didn't
tell me about it.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.230
OKAY.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.129
AND, UH...

35:16.240 --> 35:18.071
YOU KNOW,
BRENDA'S OVER THERE TOO.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.341
IT'S JUST ME AND MAYA HERE.

35:24.850 --> 35:27.512
UM, ARE YOU OKAY?

35:29.490 --> 35:31.958
I'M FINE.

35:32.060 --> 35:35.359
I'LL SEE YOU SOON
I HOPE. BYE.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.608
OH, HELLO, HONEY.

35:45.710 --> 35:49.339
( giggles )
TAKE OFF YOUR BUSINESS CLOTHES
AND COME JOIN US.

35:49.440 --> 35:54.070
SARAH MADE DINNER,
AND BETTINA'S IN RARE FORM.

35:54.180 --> 35:56.910
AND DOMINIQUE BROUGHT
SUSIE BRIGHT.

35:57.020 --> 35:59.341
DO YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS?

35:59.450 --> 36:01.452
NO.

36:02.490 --> 36:06.187
OH, THE WOMEN THOUGHT
SOME MARIJUANA

36:06.290 --> 36:09.054
MIGHT EASE THE PAIN
OF THE LOSS.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.219
I GUESS YOU FOUND IT.

36:11.330 --> 36:14.094
THIS SEEMS VERY BROWN.

36:14.200 --> 36:18.159
IS IT THE SAME STRENGTH
AS THE GREEN STUFF WITH
THE PUNGENT AROMA?

36:34.020 --> 36:36.284
DO YOU GUYS HAVE PAPERS?

36:36.390 --> 36:39.553
UH, THEY WERE ACTUALLY
HOPING FOR A BONG.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.936
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO PUT
WATER IN THAT, RIGHT?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.463
BETTINA KNOWS.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.536
OH, HONEY.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.449
WHAT?

36:59.750 --> 37:02.776
I DON'T HATE YOU.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.150
I DON'T HATE YOU
EITHER, MOM.

37:07.250 --> 37:09.480
YOU'RE JUST
SO MUCH LIKE ME.

37:09.590 --> 37:13.128
AND I SEE YOU
DOING THESE THINGS AND I FEEL
LIKE I'M SEEING MYSELF.

37:13.230 --> 37:15.551
WELL, I'M NOT
THAT MUCH LIKE YOU.

37:16.730 --> 37:19.392
IF YOU GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS
AND IT'S MY FAULT,

37:19.500 --> 37:21.297
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.539
NO, YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.835
I MEAN, I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO SUPPORT MYSELF.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.977
AND SOON AS THIS GRANT
COMES THROUGH I WILL.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.207
I MEAN, THIS JOB IS
JUST FOR NOW.

37:31.310 --> 37:33.141
PROMISE ME...

37:33.250 --> 37:36.276
PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE
WHO YOU WANNA BE.

37:46.460 --> 37:51.090
OH, I LOVE YOU,
SWEETHEART.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.725
I LOVE YOU TOO, MOM.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.607
YOU LOOK SO CORPORATE.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.075
( giggles )

38:02.180 --> 38:04.398
YOU LOOK
SO NOT CORPORATE.

38:04.510 --> 38:07.001
WON'T YOU COME DOWN
AND JOIN US?

38:07.110 --> 38:10.568
I CAN'T.
AS SOON AS I GET
THIS HOT-DOG SUIT OFF

38:10.680 --> 38:12.648
I AM GONNA TAKE A BATH
AND BE NAKED.

38:12.750 --> 38:16.413
IF I PUT ANYTHING ELSE ON
WITH A WAISTBAND
I'M GONNA CRY.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.023
I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS
CROSSED ANYWAY.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.779
( groans )

38:23.630 --> 38:26.895
Lederhosen
are trousers.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.468
Ah.

38:29.570 --> 38:31.936
But German for song
is lieder.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.339
Lieder.
Yes, correct.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.078
( knocking at door)

38:43.180 --> 38:46.718
HEY.

38:46.820 --> 38:50.051
Woman: _
Is there something
you wanted?

38:53.030 --> 38:56.227
Billy:
MAYBE IT'S TRUE THAT IT WASN'T
CLAIRE THAT I LOVED SO MUCH--

38:56.330 --> 39:01.358
BUT I LOVED HOW IT FELT
TO SEE THE WORLD WITH
ANOTHER PERSON...

39:02.400 --> 39:04.539
TO BE THE TWO OF US.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.801
I FELT LIKE SHE WAS
MY FIRST REAL LOVE.

39:08.910 --> 39:11.549
- ( TV turns off)
- I KNOW SHE'S JUST A KID,

39:11.650 --> 39:14.676
BUT WE WERE KIDS TOGETHER.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.645
( sighs )

39:20.650 --> 39:24.188
MY FIRST LOVE JUST DIED.

39:24.290 --> 39:26.281
SERIOUSLY?

39:26.390 --> 39:29.097
YEAH.
I WAS 15 WHEN I MET HER.

39:30.330 --> 39:33.493
SHE WAS 32.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.694
- WHOA.
- YEAH, OH, YEAH.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.031
EVERYONE AFTERWARDS
GOT ALL EXCITED, YOU KNOW--

39:40.140 --> 39:42.074
"WHAT DID SHE DO TO YOU?"

39:43.580 --> 39:45.901
EVERYBODY ALWAYS THOUGHT
SHE DID SOMETHING TO ME.

39:51.550 --> 39:53.586
YOU KNOW,
UP UNTIL FIONA

39:53.690 --> 39:57.148
I HAD JUST BEEN FOOLING AROUND
WITH GIRLS MY OWN AGE--

39:57.260 --> 40:02.596
DARK-ROOM-TRYING-TO-GET-
MY-HAN D-DOWN-SOM E-GIRL'S- PANTS
BU LLSHIT.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.897
FIONA LET ME
SEE ALL OF HER.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.898
AND I JUST LOVED HER.

40:14.210 --> 40:17.600
AND THAT WHOLE YEAR
I WAS SEEING OTHER GIRLS,
BUT I'M JUST-- I'M...

40:17.710 --> 40:20.645
( laughs )
YOU KNOW, I WROTE HER LETTERS.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.979
SOME OF THEM RHYMED.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.883
NOW I KNOW SHE PROBABLY LAUGHED
WHEN SHE READ THOSE LETTERS.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.120
I DOUBT SHE LAUGHED.

40:34.230 --> 40:37.859
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LOVE ISN'T SOMETHING YOU FEEL,
IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.997
IF THE PERSON YOU'RE WITH
DOESN'T WANT IT, YOU KNOW,

40:41.100 --> 40:45.969
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR
AND SAVE IT FOR SOMEONE
WHO DOES.

40:51.310 --> 40:54.108
Bettina:
ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY
FOR US TO BE DOWN HERE, FISHER?

40:54.210 --> 40:56.747
Ruth:
OF COURSE I'M SURE.

40:56.850 --> 41:00.741
WE'VE ALL BEEN CONDITIONED
NOT TO TOUCH THE DEAD.

41:00.850 --> 41:04.388
- BUT IT'S OKAY.
- Bettina: OH, FIONA.

41:04.490 --> 41:07.721
YOU LOOK GOOD, BABE.

41:19.540 --> 41:22.930
I LOVE YOU.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.498
I FORGIVE YOU, FIONA,
FOR DEFLOWERING MY BOY.

41:26.610 --> 41:29.249
Brenda:
OH, SHE'S THE ONE.

41:29.350 --> 41:31.409
HE WAS ONLY 15.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.114
I KNOW, NATE TOLD ME.

41:34.220 --> 41:35.551
Ruth:
IT'S OKAY.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.651
HE WAS OKAY.

41:38.590 --> 41:41.184
OH, THANK YOU.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.984

44:08.840 --> 44:12.344
OH, THANK GOD,
THE CALIFORNIA ARTS
COMMISSION.

44:12.450 --> 44:14.600
- YES!
- YOU LOOK NICE.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.017
YOU MUST
BE JOKING.

44:16.120 --> 44:20.147
IT'S SEXY,
LIKE A BUSINESS LADY.

44:27.530 --> 44:30.055
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
HONEY?

44:30.160 --> 44:32.469
I JUST GOT REJECTED
FOR MY GRANT.

44:32.570 --> 44:34.891
THOSE DICKS.
LET ME SEE THAT.

44:37.740 --> 44:41.130
OH, WELL,
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ONE.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.128
SHIT!

44:44.510 --> 44:47.502
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
AN ARTIST.

44:47.610 --> 44:49.771
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

44:49.880 --> 44:52.883
DID IT HURT YOUR FEELINGS
WHEN I SAID IT?

44:52.990 --> 44:55.413
( sighs )
WELL, YEAH.

44:55.520 --> 44:57.579
MAYBE I'M RIGHT.

44:57.690 --> 45:01.558
MAYBE IF YOU WERE
AN ARTIST, YOU'D HAVE LAUGHED
WHEN I SAID THAT.

45:01.660 --> 45:03.196
LIKE, IF YOU TOLD ME
I WAS PURPLE

45:03.300 --> 45:07.088
I WOULD LAUGH BECAUSE
I KNOW I'M NOT PURPLE.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.395
BUT WHEN I SAID YOU WEREN'T
AN ARTIST, YOU FELT BAD

45:09.500 --> 45:12.663
MAYBE BECAUSE THERE'S
A GRAIN OF TRUTH IN IT.

45:12.770 --> 45:14.499
( sighs )

45:14.610 --> 45:18.774
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TOOK ME BY MY SHOULDERS
AND LOOKED ME IN MY EYES

45:18.880 --> 45:21.371
AND TOLD ME THAT I WAS
AN ARTIST.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.970
MAYBE YOU WERE.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.015
MAYBE ARE.
MAYBE YOU AREN'T.
I DON'T KNOW.

45:28.220 --> 45:31.383
NO ONE ELSE CAN
TELL ANYONE WHAT TO DO,

45:31.490 --> 45:33.856
LEAST OF ALL ME.

45:36.830 --> 45:38.866
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

45:40.670 --> 45:44.538
- ( door opens )
- Vanessa: DONNA, ARE YOU--
( gasps )

45:44.640 --> 45:47.404
HELLO.
HOW DO YOU DO?

45:47.510 --> 45:49.330
WHO ARE YOU?

45:49.440 --> 45:51.806
THAT'S MR. CLARINGTON.

45:54.310 --> 45:56.346
WHO IS HE?

45:56.450 --> 45:59.510
OH, HE'S HOMELESS.
I WAS COMING OUT
OF THE TRADER JOE'S

45:59.620 --> 46:02.555
AND HE WAS HUNGRY
SO I WAS JUST GOING
TO MAKE HIM SOME PANCAKES.

46:02.660 --> 46:04.184
I KNOW IT'S NOT
A GREAT MEAL, BUT--

46:04.290 --> 46:06.554
- WHERE ARE THE BOYS?
- THEY'RE AT SCHOOL.

46:06.660 --> 46:08.924
DONNA...

46:09.030 --> 46:13.091
YOU CANNOT BRING
STRANGE PEOPLE HOME.
THIS ISN'T CANADA!

46:13.200 --> 46:15.168
I WASN'T TRYING
TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE.

46:15.270 --> 46:17.898
BUT THANK YOU BOTH KINDLY
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.333
- NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE!
- OH MY GOD, THAT'S SO MEAN.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.908
- I'M SO SORRY,
MR. CLARINGTON.
- YOU'RE FIRED, DONNA.

46:24.010 --> 46:28.003
I'M CALLING THE AGENCY
AND I'M TELLING THEM YOU'RE
OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!

46:28.110 --> 46:29.316
I NEEDED SOMEONE TO HELP ME,

46:29.420 --> 46:31.843
NOT SHOOT VIDEOS
OF THEMSELVES DANCING

46:31.950 --> 46:34.145
AND INVITE THE HOMELESS IN
FOR PANCAKE BREAKFAST.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.787
GO PACK YOUR STUFF.
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE NOW.

46:36.890 --> 46:39.085
I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

46:39.190 --> 46:42.023
I DON'T CARE.
FIND SOMEWHERE TO GO!

46:42.130 --> 46:44.155
FINE.

46:45.730 --> 46:50.360
IF I GET SOMETHING
FROM "SURVIVOR," CAN YOU
FORWARD IT TO ME?

46:50.470 --> 46:52.438
YES.

46:53.640 --> 46:55.528
OKAY.

47:00.710 --> 47:03.975
( knocking at door)

47:04.080 --> 47:06.685
- PUNK.
- WAIT ONE SECOND
BEFORE YOU OPEN THAT!

47:06.790 --> 47:10.317
- David: GUYS.
- THE RESTRAINING ORDER
WENT OUT ON FRIDAY.

47:10.420 --> 47:13.321
- Anthony: YOU'RE WEAKER.
- Durrell: YOU'RE WEAKEST!

47:13.430 --> 47:15.694
I'M TRAINED IN HANDLING
PSYCHOTIC BREAKS.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.621
BOYS, WE HAVE COMPANY!

47:18.730 --> 47:20.322
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
A SHITSTORM,

47:20.430 --> 47:22.068
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
HOW I CAN HELP YOU.

47:22.170 --> 47:24.491
- Anthony: OW! I HATE YOU.
- OKAY, LATER. BYE.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.431
SORRY.
EVERYTHING'S
FALLING APART.

47:26.540 --> 47:29.634
- MUST BE THE MOON.
- YEAH, EXACTLY, WE HAVE
THE SAME SITUATION HERE.

47:29.740 --> 47:31.139
THE BOYS ARE NOT
DOING WELL.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.969
- NOT AT ALL.
- ( cell phone ringing )

47:33.080 --> 47:34.911
I-- GO AHEAD,
I WILL LET IT RING.

47:35.020 --> 47:37.238
- TELL ME HOW IT'S BEEN.
- WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM HERE.

47:37.350 --> 47:40.080
OR NOT!
WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY.

47:40.190 --> 47:43.353
WHAT WE NEED
IS YOUR INPUT,

47:43.460 --> 47:46.657
YOUR FEEDBACK.
PERHAPS THE BEST WAY
TO HANDLE THIS--

47:46.760 --> 47:48.648
I AM SO SORRY.
I DO HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

47:48.760 --> 47:52.127
- Anthony: GIRL!
- NO. I'M ALMOST
OUT OF HERE.

47:52.230 --> 47:54.562
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
OKAY...

47:54.670 --> 47:59.061
- UH, THAT'LL BE IT THEN?
- LISTEN, I DON'T THINK THINGS
ARE WORKING OUT FOR THE KIDS.

47:59.170 --> 48:02.003
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE
WE'RE THE RIGHT MATCH.

48:06.150 --> 48:10.109
YOU HAVE NO IDEA THE HELL
I HAVE PULLED CHILDREN OUT OF.

48:10.220 --> 48:13.144
I MEAN, HOUSES FILLED
TO THE BRIM WITH GARBAGE,
CAT FECES.

48:13.250 --> 48:15.889
YOU ARE DOING FINE
IN MY BOOK.

48:15.990 --> 48:17.810
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
THESE BOYS DOING BETTER.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.979
- THEY'RE FLOURISHING.
- "FLOURISHING"?

48:20.090 --> 48:22.593
GOOD.
YES, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT. THANK YOU.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.567
- WE'RE THRILLED
TO HAVE THEM HERE.
- OKAY. GREAT. YEAH--

48:25.670 --> 48:28.093
- LISTEN, COULD YOU JUST
STAY FIV'IugINU-I—ES?

48:28.200 --> 48:30.998
- WAIT. SHE NEEDS TO GO.
- I'VE GOTTA GO.

48:31.100 --> 48:32.806
YEAH, I'M ON MY WAY.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.128
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WITH TRAFFIC...

48:37.910 --> 48:39.707
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
JUST DID THAT.

48:39.810 --> 48:42.517
YOU KNOW, DAVID,
JUST PRETENDING THAT
SOMETHING IS WORKING

48:42.620 --> 48:46.044
- DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING.
- ( David sighs )

48:46.150 --> 48:51.554
DON'T WORRY, GUYS.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE OKAY.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.685
Kirsten:
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM PERSONNEL YET?

48:53.790 --> 48:55.451
I STARTED OUT
AS A TEMP TOO.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.552
IF YOU HAVE HALF A BRAIN
THEY'LL OFFER YOU
SOMETHING PERMANENT.

48:58.660 --> 49:01.561
DID YOU GET MY PRESENT?

49:01.670 --> 49:04.639
OH, THE E-CARD
WITH THE DAYI\IIE(SI;ING PUPPIES?

49:04.740 --> 49:06.901
IT WAS VERY CUTE.
THANK YOU.

49:07.010 --> 49:08.204
YEAH, BABY.

49:08.310 --> 49:10.733
NO, I MEANT
MY OLD BATHROOM PASS.

49:10.840 --> 49:13.047
IF PERSONNEL CALLS,
WHICH I HEARD
COULD HAPPEN,

49:13.150 --> 49:16.449
THEY'LL GIVE YOU YOUR OWN,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME YOU CAN
USE MY OLD MY ONE.

49:16.550 --> 49:18.370
I'M TELLING
OPERATIONS.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.119
REALLY,
YOU CAN HAVE IT,
CLAIRE.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.126
THANK YOU.

49:29.230 --> 49:32.529
YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT HERE, CLAIRE.
YOU REALLY ARE.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.431
- ( New Age music playing )

49:42.440 --> 49:44.328
HELLO?

49:46.880 --> 49:48.142
YEAH.

49:48.250 --> 49:51.947
YEAH YEAH,
I CAN DEFINITELY
PICK UP THE KIDS.

49:52.050 --> 49:54.541
OH, OKAY.
OKAY. GOOD GOOD.

49:54.650 --> 49:56.459
SEE YOU THEN.
BYE-BYE.

50:04.200 --> 50:07.067
I'M GONNA TAKE FIONA
TO THE CREMATORIUM.

50:07.170 --> 50:10.333
HOW NICE OF YOU.
I'M SURE SHE'LL
APPRECIATE THAT.

50:15.540 --> 50:17.405
HAVE YOU SEEN SARAH?

50:17.510 --> 50:20.104
OH, SHE ALREADY LEFT.
SHE WAS CANOODLING
IN THE BACK ROW,

50:20.210 --> 50:22.314
- FOUND AN OLD BOYFRIEND
I THINK.
- SHE LEFT?

50:22.420 --> 50:24.877
- ARE YOU GOING THEN?
- GOING WHERE?

50:24.980 --> 50:27.312
UP TO TOPANGA.
SHALL WE MEET THERE?

50:28.620 --> 50:31.885
AREN'T WE ALL GOING OUT
TO THE HOME AND...

50:31.990 --> 50:33.878
- COMMUNE...
- (chuckles)

50:33.990 --> 50:35.651
WEEKEND?

50:35.760 --> 50:37.591
OH.

50:37.700 --> 50:40.225
WE WERE JOKING.

50:43.740 --> 50:45.139
( sighs )

50:45.240 --> 50:48.732
( doorbell rings )

50:48.840 --> 50:52.071
HEY, GUYS!
GO PUT YOUR BOOKS
IN YOUR ROOMS

50:52.180 --> 50:54.375
AND GET READY FOR YOUR BATH.

50:57.820 --> 51:00.084
YOU WANNA MOVE BACK IN?

51:02.020 --> 51:03.715
EXCUSE ME?

51:03.820 --> 51:07.426
YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT IT AND I GUESS
YOU WERE RIGHT.

51:07.530 --> 51:10.192
UM, IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE BOYS.
THEY NEED YOU HERE.

51:12.970 --> 51:14.699
WOW.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.392
YEAH.

51:16.500 --> 51:19.799
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
VANESSA.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.777
YEAH.
SO, I'M STARTING DINNER.

51:22.880 --> 51:28.000
WHY DON'T YOU GO DO
THEIR BATHS AND WE CAN EAT
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES?

51:28.110 --> 51:31.773
LET ME, UH, TAKE THIS
TO THE KITCHEN FIRST.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.689
MM.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.362
OH.

51:54.470 --> 51:55.903
HELLO.

51:56.010 --> 51:58.604
I BROUGHT
THE POTS AND PANS.

52:00.050 --> 52:03.349
THAT-- THAT WASN'T
NECESSARY.

52:03.450 --> 52:06.385
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
YOUR OTHER IDEA WAS
THE BETTER ONE.

52:06.490 --> 52:10.551
I WENT DOWN
TO CRATE & BARREL AND
BOUGHT MYSELF ANOTHER SET.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.821
YOU DID?

52:12.930 --> 52:15.751
I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON, RUTH.

52:15.860 --> 52:18.021
YOU DO?

52:18.130 --> 52:20.928
YES, I DO.
NONE OF YOUR FURNITURE
IS HERE.

52:21.030 --> 52:22.566
YOU ONLY BROUGHT ONE
CHANGE OF CLOTHING.

52:22.670 --> 52:25.366
- NO TOILETRIES.
- I BROUGHT MY SOAP.

52:25.470 --> 52:28.633
OH NO, PLEASE, LOOK--

52:28.740 --> 52:31.800
LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE
OF EACH OTHER'S TIME, OKAY?

52:31.910 --> 52:35.004
IT'S NOT RESPECT FUL.
I GET IT.

52:35.110 --> 52:38.079
YOU WANT TO LEAVE ME.

52:38.180 --> 52:41.183
BUT FIRST YOU WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE
EVERYTHING THAT I NEED,

52:41.290 --> 52:43.315
WHICH IS...

52:43.420 --> 52:46.753
VERY KIND AND THOUGHTFUL
AS YOU ALWAYS ARE.

52:46.860 --> 52:48.350
GEORGE, IT'S NOT BECAUSE--

52:48.460 --> 52:51.623
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY.
IT'S OKAY.

52:51.730 --> 52:54.290
I CALLED THE DEAN.

52:54.400 --> 52:56.095
I START BACK
THIS SEMESTER.

52:56.200 --> 52:59.909
AND THANKS TO YOU
I HAVE MY APARTMENT...

53:00.010 --> 53:02.604
AND MY POTS...

53:02.710 --> 53:04.769
AND MY PANS.

53:04.880 --> 53:07.371
SO THANK YOU.

53:10.950 --> 53:13.487
I LOVED YOU.

53:15.090 --> 53:18.116
YOU LOVED ME.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.780
THAT WAS A GOOD THING.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.822
NOW IT'S CHANGED.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.430
SO...

53:30.970 --> 53:33.530
CONSIDER YOURSELF FREE.

53:42.210 --> 53:44.542
( pots clang )

53:54.730 --> 53:59.394
* ON EVERY DAY
YOU GAZE UPON THE SUNSET *

53:59.500 --> 54:03.732
* WITH SUCH LOVE
AND INTENSITY *

54:05.410 --> 54:07.401
* WHY...

54:07.510 --> 54:10.206
* IT'S, UH, IT'S ALMOST

54:10.310 --> 54:13.404
* AS IF YOU COULD
ONLY CRACK THE CODE *

54:13.510 --> 54:16.343
* THEN YOU'D
FINALLY UNDERSTAND *

54:16.450 --> 54:21.945
* WHAT THIS ALL MEANS

54:22.050 --> 54:26.419
* AH, BUT IF YOU COULD,
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD *

54:26.530 --> 54:28.782
* TRADE IT ALL?

54:28.890 --> 54:32.257
* ALL THE PAIN

54:32.370 --> 54:35.692
* AND SUFFERING

54:37.540 --> 54:39.508
* AH, BUT THEN YOU'D MISS

54:39.610 --> 54:44.900
* THE BEAUTY OF THE LIGHT
UPON THIS EARTH *

54:45.010 --> 54:50.846
* ANDD THE SWEETNESS
OF THE LEAVING. *
