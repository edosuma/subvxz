WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.711
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island.

00:03.711 --> 00:05.714
RICK: We know we have a target
 in the Money Pit.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.214
CRAIG: Fingers crossed
 we hit the vault.

00:07.214 --> 00:09.050
RICK: All it would take
 is one little,

00:09.050 --> 00:10.926
obscure piece of paper
to make it all worth it.

00:10.926 --> 00:12.887
-Here it is.
-DAVIN: Oh.

00:12.887 --> 00:15.265
RICK: We're on something
 really, really hard.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.809
Could this be the "aha" moment?

00:17.809 --> 00:19.561
-MARTY: We have another sample
for you.
-Let's have a look at it.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.562
MARTY: We need to run
 composition analysis on it.

00:21.562 --> 00:23.981
-Okay.
-MARTY: Wow.

00:23.981 --> 00:25.692
GABRIEL:
It appears to be Roman.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.068
-Wow.
-No way.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.986
Roman, baby.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.908
NARRATOR: There is an island
 in the North Atlantic...

00:34.908 --> 00:38.371
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.371 --> 00:41.750
for more than 200 years.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.793
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.793 --> 00:47.130
with strange symbols carved
into it...

00:47.130 --> 00:50.299
mysterious fragments
of human bone...

00:50.299 --> 00:54.429
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.429 --> 00:56.639
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.639 --> 01:01.351
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.351 --> 01:04.272
And, according to legend,

01:04.272 --> 01:07.483
one more will have to die,

01:07.483 --> 01:11.069
before the treasure
can be found.

01:22.623 --> 01:26.503
It is the end of another
long day on Oak Island...

01:26.503 --> 01:28.962
-ALL: Hey, Marty.
-Hey, guys.

01:28.962 --> 01:30.882
NARRATOR: ...as Rick Lagina,
 Craig Tester

01:30.882 --> 01:32.634
and members of their team

01:32.634 --> 01:35.804
gather to inform Rick's brother
Marty

01:35.804 --> 01:39.223
and area archeologist
Laird Niven about a new

01:39.223 --> 01:42.811
and potentially important
discovery.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.313
Okay. So, uh, we all would like

01:46.313 --> 01:48.316
to bring everyone up to speed,
including Marty,

01:48.316 --> 01:51.319
about the recent finds
that-that Gary made.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.570
I did send you some pictures,
I believe.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.781
Yeah, got 'em right here.

01:55.781 --> 01:58.575
RICK: Which, I think
we all find quite remarkable.

01:58.575 --> 02:00.245
I'd love to hear about it.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.745
-RICK: Gary?
-GARY: Yeah.

02:01.745 --> 02:05.415
Uh, Mike West decides
to run his equipment

02:05.415 --> 02:07.459
along the top of the beach.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.002
Right.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.840
And we started getting targets
straight away.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.717
And what we found
just blew us away.

02:15.717 --> 02:17.512
And we'll see what you think,
Laird.

02:21.348 --> 02:23.768
Huh.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.521
MARTY:
Wow.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.064
I mean, is this what
I think it is?

02:29.064 --> 02:31.860
Yeah. I mean, it's well-made,
isn't it?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.277
-Yeah.
-LAIRD: It's handmade.

02:33.277 --> 02:36.114
It looks like a crossbow bolt,
does it not?

02:36.114 --> 02:39.033
-That's exactly what I said.
-Yeah.

02:39.033 --> 02:42.245
GARY: Unbelievable!
Look at this.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.746
What is it?

02:43.746 --> 02:46.415
NARRATOR:
 Earlier this same day,

02:46.415 --> 02:50.043
while metal detecting at
the beachfront on Lot 26,

02:50.043 --> 02:53.088
Jack Begley, Gary Drayton

02:53.088 --> 02:55.884
and geophysicist
Mike West discovered

02:55.884 --> 02:57.759
an unusual metal object

02:57.759 --> 03:00.722
approximately ten inches
beneath the rocky soil.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.306
I mean, this is old.

03:02.306 --> 03:04.558
We're talking, like,
Templar old.

03:04.558 --> 03:07.395
NARRATOR:
 Used as a deadly weapon

03:07.395 --> 03:09.271
as early as
the seventh century BC,

03:09.271 --> 03:12.567
the crossbow was, for its time,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.318
a type of "high-tech bow
and arrow,"

03:14.318 --> 03:16.945
one that could shoot
projectiles with great speed

03:16.945 --> 03:19.073
and deadly accuracy.

03:19.073 --> 03:23.493
The arrows, or bolts,
were so finely sharpened

03:23.493 --> 03:26.204
they could even penetrate
metal armor.

03:27.915 --> 03:31.920
Aren't most crossbow bolts
wood-shafted, though?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.795
They come in different
varieties.

03:33.795 --> 03:38.259
I mean, this looks like this was
made for piercing chainmail.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.677
LAIRD: Finely made.
Like, really finely made.

03:40.677 --> 03:43.389
Yeah, and it not rusting
over all these years,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.265
you know, minimal,
especially on the tip,

03:45.265 --> 03:47.225
-where it was worked the most.
-MARTY: Yeah. Yeah, the tip.

03:47.225 --> 03:49.853
CRAIG:
Yeah. Nice, hardened iron,

03:49.853 --> 03:52.606
-which makes me think it's old.
-LAIRD: Yep.

03:52.606 --> 03:54.317
I mean, the quality
of iron back then,

03:54.317 --> 03:55.944
it just doesn't rust very fast.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.945
RICK: You-you've always said
that, right, Gary?

03:57.945 --> 04:01.782
Yeah. The older the iron,
the better condition it's in.

04:01.782 --> 04:06.663
And this could be potentially,
like, an unbelievable find.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.498
NARRATOR:
 A medieval crossbow bolt?

04:09.498 --> 04:12.293
Found on the shore
of Oak Island?

04:12.293 --> 04:15.170
But if so, how did it get here?

04:15.170 --> 04:18.800
Could it be connected in some
way to the lead cross found

04:18.800 --> 04:21.511
at Smith's Cove last year?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.637
It's clearly very interesting,
what they've found,

04:23.637 --> 04:25.807
this so-called crossbow bolt.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.016
Very interesting,
uh, very out of place.

04:28.016 --> 04:29.310
I mean,
it's an interesting object.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.644
There's no question about it.

04:30.644 --> 04:33.480
Unlike anything
we've ever found before.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.985
MARTY: Actually, Gary, if that
bolt is really, really old,

04:37.985 --> 04:39.653
it's probably more significant
than the cross

04:39.653 --> 04:42.156
because the cross

04:42.156 --> 04:45.826
is a artifact,
a religious artifact.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.036
It's possible to conjecture

04:48.036 --> 04:51.957
that it was dropped many years
after it was formed.

04:51.957 --> 04:53.543
You know, somebody could be
carrying it.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.420
But here's the thing:

04:55.420 --> 04:59.382
You don't generally carry
crossbow bolts around, you know,

04:59.382 --> 05:01.800
-for a hundred years
and then drop it.
-Yep.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.012
So if it really is old,
honestly, Rick,

05:04.012 --> 05:05.887
I'd say it's more significant
than the cross.

05:05.887 --> 05:08.725
RICK: Yeah.
Well, look, guys,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.184
I think two things come to mind.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.601
Obviously, additional testing.

05:11.601 --> 05:13.271
And the other thing is,

05:13.271 --> 05:15.189
I think we need to buy Gary
a new shirt

05:15.189 --> 05:18.317
with a larger, deeper pocket.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.028
-Yeah.
-RICK: I think these finds

05:20.028 --> 05:21.862
are very intriguing--
and Laird, you'll help us?

05:21.862 --> 05:23.406
-You'll assist?
-Yeah, absolutely.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.033
RICK: There's more things
to be learned.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.367
And to that extent, uh,
the work continues.

05:27.367 --> 05:30.038
-Sempre avanti. Keep going.
-RICK: Sempre avanti.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.581
-All right.
-See ya, Marty.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.956
-Okay, guys.
-See ya, Marty.
-See ya.

05:32.956 --> 05:34.207
CRAIG:
Bye.

05:34.207 --> 05:35.668
-Ready?
-Okay.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.052
NARRATOR:
 The next day, Rick Lagina,

05:44.052 --> 05:46.387
Craig Tester
and Charles Barkhouse

05:46.387 --> 05:49.723
head over to the area known
as the Money Pit.

05:49.723 --> 05:52.976
They are in the early stages
of finding out

05:52.976 --> 05:54.978
if recently conducted
seismic testing

05:54.978 --> 05:57.899
has allowed them to pinpoint
the precise location

05:57.899 --> 06:03.737
of the original treasure site,
first discovered in 1795.

06:03.737 --> 06:06.115
What depth are we at?

06:06.115 --> 06:08.576
Down to 129.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.745
NARRATOR:
 Just one day ago,

06:10.745 --> 06:13.247
the team from Choice Drilling
began a new

06:13.247 --> 06:17.752
six-and-a-half-inch-wide
borehole, known as DE-6.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.377
There's your wood.

06:19.377 --> 06:21.422
Bring it on over.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.716
NARRATOR: At a depth of 93 feet,
 they discovered evidence

06:24.716 --> 06:29.096
of a horizontal wooden beam,
followed by a three-foot void.

06:29.096 --> 06:31.807
-TERRY: I love it.
-CRAIG: It was laying this way.

06:31.807 --> 06:34.143
-Yeah.
-Not standing up,
it was laying like this.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.105
So, it could be the top
of a... a tunnel.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.941
NARRATOR:
 It was at this same depth

06:39.941 --> 06:42.110
that recent seismic scanning
of the area revealed

06:42.110 --> 06:45.947
what could be a network
of underground tunnels.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.824
That carries on into what looks
like a larger network

06:48.824 --> 06:51.619
around the 100
to 110 foot-ish range.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.620
-Flood tunnel?
-Could be.

06:53.620 --> 06:57.125
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
 Rick, Marty and their partners

06:57.125 --> 06:59.127
have actually located one of

06:59.127 --> 07:01.629
the legendary booby-trapped
flood tunnels?

07:01.629 --> 07:03.630
The tunnels which,
many believe,

07:03.630 --> 07:06.134
were constructed
in order to prevent searchers

07:06.134 --> 07:09.220
from finding the centuries-old
treasure vault?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.309
What are you calling the depth?

07:15.309 --> 07:17.687
-164.
-You getting anything?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.146
-It's really soft.
-CRAIG: Right.

07:19.146 --> 07:20.856
Can you drill another, whatever,

07:20.856 --> 07:22.983
-until you hit something hard?
-Sure.

07:22.983 --> 07:24.485
Okay.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.821
NARRATOR:
Although the team is encouraged

07:26.821 --> 07:28.990
by locating a possible tunnel,

07:28.990 --> 07:31.117
they're even more hopeful

07:31.117 --> 07:33.451
to reach another one
of the intriguing anomalies

07:33.451 --> 07:35.997
that was detected
by seismic scanning:

07:35.997 --> 07:39.332
a nearly 30-foot-wide void

07:39.332 --> 07:43.670
at a depth
of approximately 170 feet.

07:43.670 --> 07:48.175
It was at this depth,
last year, that the team--

07:48.175 --> 07:51.387
while drilling with
a 60-inch-wide steel caisson--

07:51.387 --> 07:53.598
encountered what they believed

07:53.598 --> 07:56.183
could be the legendary
Chappell Vault,

07:56.183 --> 07:58.185
a seven-foot tall wooden box

07:58.185 --> 08:01.521
first discovered by treasure
hunters William Chappell

08:01.521 --> 08:04.774
and Frederick Blair in 1897.

08:04.774 --> 08:08.237
However, instead of penetrating
the vault,

08:08.237 --> 08:10.947
the caisson is believed
to have actually pushed

08:10.947 --> 08:13.533
the mysterious object
further down into the mud

08:13.533 --> 08:15.702
and off to the side.

08:15.702 --> 08:18.538
When we were doing
the big can on H-8,

08:18.538 --> 08:21.375
we had a-a plug where
the bottom of the hole

08:21.375 --> 08:23.877
kept on being pushed
to the side.

08:23.877 --> 08:26.379
So what was being pushed
to the side?

08:26.379 --> 08:29.759
Drilling this well
might indicate

08:29.759 --> 08:32.220
what was pushed aside from H-8.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.721
So we are looking for any kind
of evidence in that area.

08:34.721 --> 08:37.057
Fingers crossed we hit
the vault

08:37.057 --> 08:40.644
or a debris field from
the treasure itself falling.

08:40.644 --> 08:43.355
So it's an excellent place
to be.

08:45.566 --> 08:48.235
CRAIG:
Well, I hope we have something.

08:48.235 --> 08:50.071
RICK:
I hope so.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.573
BRENNAN: What would that
something be you'd like?

08:53.573 --> 08:55.243
CRAIG:
I'd settle for silver.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.911
I don't need gold right now.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.163
-One step at a time, right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.626
I'd love to have wood
right here.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.225
RICK: We're on something
really, really hard.

09:20.225 --> 09:22.227
Wow.

09:25.605 --> 09:27.942
-RICK: Wow.
-(metal creaking)

09:27.942 --> 09:30.318
We're on something really,
really hard.

09:30.318 --> 09:32.779
NARRATOR:
 While drilling DE-6,

09:32.779 --> 09:35.240
a new borehole
in the Money Pit area,

09:35.240 --> 09:37.951
the Oak Island team has just
struck an object

09:37.951 --> 09:41.788
at a depth of some
200 feet deep underground,

09:41.788 --> 09:45.459
an object that seems
impossible to penetrate.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.169
RICK:
What's your guess?

09:48.169 --> 09:50.463
It looks like we tagged
something hard, which we assumed

09:50.463 --> 09:52.799
to be interface,
bedrock of some sort.

09:52.799 --> 09:55.344
Serious problem for you?

09:55.344 --> 09:56.928
I think he just should stop.

09:56.928 --> 10:01.308
We hit something around
the 204, 205 range, so...

10:01.308 --> 10:04.769
TERRY: It was a little bit
out of target zone.

10:04.769 --> 10:09.107
-We have the bedrock plateau
here.
-BRENNAN: Yeah.

10:09.107 --> 10:11.318
NARRATOR: Despite the fact
 that the team

10:11.318 --> 10:12.986
had previously recovered
promising evidence

10:12.986 --> 10:15.280
from this same borehole,

10:15.280 --> 10:17.991
leading them to believe
they might have located

10:17.991 --> 10:19.784
the original Money Pit shaft,

10:19.784 --> 10:23.496
hitting bedrock offers
a disappointing development.

10:23.496 --> 10:25.166
It means they may have missed

10:25.166 --> 10:27.125
the large underground anomaly

10:27.125 --> 10:29.836
that was indicated
on the 3D map created

10:29.836 --> 10:32.630
by the team's recent
seismic scanning.

10:32.630 --> 10:35.009
It also means
they will be forced

10:35.009 --> 10:37.802
to choose a different site
in the hopes

10:37.802 --> 10:42.182
of locating
the legendary Chappell Vault.

10:42.182 --> 10:45.977
We certainly didn't hit
the center of the anomaly, and,

10:45.977 --> 10:48.938
you know,
that's good and bad news, but

10:48.938 --> 10:51.817
as long as the drill
is down hole, there's hope.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.028
There's a chance
you might encounter something.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.326
You know, as usual, with all
the things we've done to date

11:00.326 --> 11:03.245
on Oak Island, there's things
to be learned, a few more

11:03.245 --> 11:06.289
questions,
a few disappointments.

11:06.289 --> 11:11.294
Well, you know, the tunnel to me
is very interesting,

11:11.294 --> 11:14.298
and either... if it's
an original, it's fantastic.

11:14.298 --> 11:17.802
If it's a searcher, it helps us
define where the Money Pit is.

11:17.802 --> 11:21.263
And, uh, we need to get back and
look at all the different maps,

11:21.263 --> 11:23.599
interpretations
of where those tunnels were.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.058
Right.

11:25.058 --> 11:26.559
Definite disappointment.

11:26.559 --> 11:28.895
You know, we were hoping
to find, you know,

11:28.895 --> 11:31.731
a cavern at this area
and we didn't.

11:31.731 --> 11:33.734
It's just part of the process.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.697
We tested one target, and now
we move onto the next target.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.865
Well, tomorrow's another day.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.533
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.
-We'll see you gentlemen then.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.034
-Take care, guys.
-Thanks.

11:43.034 --> 11:45.203
-Take care.
-Talk to you tomorrow.

11:51.043 --> 11:55.588
NARRATOR: The next day, as Rick
 Lagina remains on the island

11:55.588 --> 11:58.174
to begin planning
the team's next steps...

11:58.174 --> 11:59.927
MARTY:
 All data's good data,

11:59.927 --> 12:01.345
and we're about to get some.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.929
NARRATOR:
 ...his brother, Marty,

12:02.929 --> 12:06.100
Craig Tester
and Marty's son Alex

12:06.100 --> 12:09.102
head some 50 miles northeast
of Oak Island

12:09.102 --> 12:13.649
to St. Mary's University
in the city of Halifax.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.568
MARTY:
 Dr. Brosseau, we're back.

12:16.568 --> 12:18.236
-Welcome back.
-We keep finding things.
(laughs)

12:18.236 --> 12:19.613
That's good.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.407
NARRATOR:
 They are meeting once again

12:21.407 --> 12:23.283
with Associate Professor
of Chemistry

12:23.283 --> 12:27.620
Dr. Christa Brosseau, an expert
in the study of metals

12:27.620 --> 12:29.414
and their chemical
compositions.

12:29.414 --> 12:32.250
-So, you've got some...
-MARTY: We have another sample

12:32.250 --> 12:33.626
for you, yes, we do indeed.

12:33.626 --> 12:35.421
So, I guess we get right to it,
right?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.965
-Yeah, let's have a look at it.
-All right.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.758
NARRATOR:
 They are hoping to find out

12:39.758 --> 12:41.969
if scientific testing
on what they believe

12:41.969 --> 12:46.639
to be a crossbow bolt
might help determine its age.

12:46.639 --> 12:49.393
Well, it looks like iron.
(laughs)

12:49.393 --> 12:50.852
-Yes.
-Yeah.

12:50.852 --> 12:53.313
-We're quite sure of that.
-Yeah.

12:53.313 --> 12:55.649
MARTY:
So, the conjecture was

12:55.649 --> 12:57.650
that it might be
a crossbow bolt.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.820
-Okay.
-Okay, which we were all
excited about.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.489
It was designed to pierce armor.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.740
-Mm-hmm.
-So,

13:03.740 --> 13:05.658
we're here
to see what you think.

13:05.658 --> 13:07.160
-Yup.
-Obviously,

13:07.160 --> 13:08.495
we're intrigued with it.

13:08.495 --> 13:10.121
We're trying to make sense out
of that.

13:10.121 --> 13:13.667
Right.
So, for-for iron, there's...

13:13.667 --> 13:15.503
The elemental analysis is
the main test

13:15.503 --> 13:17.337
-that we would be doing.
-Right, the SEM.

13:17.337 --> 13:19.465
-Okay.
-MARTY: All right, let's see

13:19.465 --> 13:21.258
-what the SEM says.
-Let's do it.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.510
Okay.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.346
NARRATOR: Using samples
 carefully collected

13:25.346 --> 13:27.431
from the surface
of the artifact...

13:27.431 --> 13:30.433
-All right, those samples are
ready. Let's go.
-CRAIG: Okay.

13:30.433 --> 13:33.645
NARRATOR: ...Dr. Brosseau and
 her colleague Dr. Xiang Yang

13:33.645 --> 13:36.524
will now perform a chemical
analysis of the metal

13:36.524 --> 13:39.192
with the help
of a high-powered

13:39.192 --> 13:42.446
Scanning Electron Microscope
or SEM.

13:42.446 --> 13:46.200
Okay, Dr. Brosseau,
I always love this part.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.451
-This is the fun part.
-Yeah.

13:48.451 --> 13:51.080
NARRATOR:
Unlike traditional microscopes,

13:51.080 --> 13:53.665
which rely on a combination
of light and lenses

13:53.665 --> 13:57.544
to magnify objects,
the SEM performs scans

13:57.544 --> 13:59.712
with a focused beam
of electrons,

13:59.712 --> 14:02.006
which can produce magnification

14:02.006 --> 14:04.384
as much
as 200,000 times greater

14:04.384 --> 14:06.511
than an object's actual size.

14:06.511 --> 14:09.764
It can also provide
a detailed analysis

14:09.764 --> 14:13.018
of the item's
chemical composition.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.563
Okay, so, it's ready.

14:16.563 --> 14:18.023
MARTY:
Yes.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.567
BROSSEAU: Once we start looking
at the sample,

14:20.567 --> 14:23.486
you'll see the image
of the object and the surface.

14:23.486 --> 14:25.322
ALEX:
That's amazing, isn't it?

14:25.322 --> 14:27.240
-Yeah.
-Wow.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.119
BROSSEAU: So, you guys look
for shiny bits on a large scale,

14:30.119 --> 14:31.620
and we look
on a very small scale.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.746
-On a small scale.
-(laughter)

14:37.960 --> 14:42.463
Okay, so we're going
to do the, uh, chemistry.

14:42.463 --> 14:45.509
CRAIG: So, right now,
you're looking at a big enough

14:45.509 --> 14:48.511
piece that
it should see any impurities.

14:48.511 --> 14:50.054
Yeah.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.644
BROSSEAU: All right,
let's see what it's made of.

14:56.644 --> 14:58.813
Iron popped up.

14:58.813 --> 15:00.441
Right.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.527
But you've got some manganese.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.779
-There is manganese in there?
-Yes. Yes.
-Yeah.

15:06.779 --> 15:08.907
NARRATOR:
 Manganese?

15:08.907 --> 15:11.534
Because manganese became used

15:11.534 --> 15:13.620
in the production
of steel and iron

15:13.620 --> 15:16.999
beginning
in the ninth century BC,

15:16.999 --> 15:20.961
its presence in the sample
could be an indication

15:20.961 --> 15:23.547
that the Oak Island team
may be in possession

15:23.547 --> 15:25.256
of something far older

15:25.256 --> 15:27.717
than what they first
thought possible.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.929
-All right, excellent analysis.
-Mm-hmm.

15:31.929 --> 15:33.640
We'll get ahold
of the weapons guy.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.975
-For sure.
-Thank you very much.
You know...

15:35.975 --> 15:37.561
-You're welcome.
-You're welcome.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.520
...the hard, scientific data
is so welcome

15:39.520 --> 15:41.606
because almost nothing we do
is like that.

15:41.606 --> 15:43.817
-Mm-hmm.
-Anyway, thank you.
Appreciate it.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.778
-CRAIG: Thank you.
-Yeah, nice to see you.
-MARTY: I'm sure we'll be back.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.153
-I'm sure we will be back.
-Yeah, nice to see you guys.

15:47.153 --> 15:48.655
Xiang, nice to see you again.

15:48.655 --> 15:50.157
BROSSEAU:
 Good luck with your search.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.491
-ALEX: Thank you.
-MARTY: Yup.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.499
NARRATOR: Following
 his informative trip

15:58.499 --> 16:00.958
to St. Mary's University,

16:00.958 --> 16:05.839
Craig Tester has arrived back
on Oak Island to Smith's Cove,

16:05.839 --> 16:07.799
where one of the team's
most ambitious

16:07.799 --> 16:11.302
and expensive projects
is well underway--

16:11.302 --> 16:17.975
the construction of a massive,
525-foot-long steel cofferdam.

16:17.975 --> 16:19.519
-Gentlemen!
-MICHEL: Good morning, Craig.
How are you?

16:19.519 --> 16:21.187
-SCOTT: Hello, Craig!
-Good. Good to see you.

16:21.187 --> 16:22.648
-Yeah, same to you.
-Hello, sir.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.191
It looks like
it's moving right along.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.775
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah. It's going good, yup.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.443
Yeah. So, how many
have you put in so far?

16:27.443 --> 16:29.571
SCOTT: That'll be the ninth
sheet right there, yeah.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.823
Timing wise,
you're ahead of time or...?

16:31.823 --> 16:33.075
I think we're pretty much
on schedule.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.659
Yeah, I think we are, right?
Yeah.

16:34.659 --> 16:36.537
-On schedule, yeah.
-Yup. Should be.
-Okay.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.330
NARRATOR:
 Since construction

16:38.330 --> 16:41.082
of the cofferdam began
just one week ago,

16:41.082 --> 16:43.626
the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

16:43.626 --> 16:46.171
has installed nine
out of the nearly

16:46.171 --> 16:48.631
120 sections
of steel sheet piling

16:48.631 --> 16:51.051
that will form
the watertight barrier.

16:51.051 --> 16:55.179
Once completed, it will allow
the site to be fully drained

16:55.179 --> 16:59.058
so that it can be excavated,
not only in the hope of finding

16:59.058 --> 17:02.062
historically-significant
artifacts, but also

17:02.062 --> 17:05.231
the remains of the legendary
box-drain flooding system

17:05.231 --> 17:07.233
that has effectively
booby-trapped

17:07.233 --> 17:09.361
the entire Money Pit area.

17:09.361 --> 17:14.074
CRAIG: Irving is driving pilings
 into the ground.

17:14.074 --> 17:18.118
Basically, they're going
to vibrate them into the ground

17:18.118 --> 17:22.915
and get us a nice, watertight
area to do our exploration in.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.669
So that's about 20 feet
you pounded down?

17:25.669 --> 17:28.130
SCOTT: They're in the ground to
the rock. It's, like, 26 feet.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.589
-CRAIG: Okay.
-Yeah.

17:29.589 --> 17:31.133
Any problems pounding 'em in?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.593
-No, they're going good,
actually.
-Yeah.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.927
SCOTT:
Got to work with the tide, too.

17:34.927 --> 17:37.263
Well, that sounds good.
You need anything from us?

17:37.263 --> 17:38.932
No, I think
we're good right now.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.143
-I think we're good for a bit.
-Yeah.
-Yup.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.604
NARRATOR:
 While Craig continues

17:43.604 --> 17:46.898
to oversee the cofferdam's
construction at Smith's Cove,

17:46.898 --> 17:51.111
Rick Lagina has called members
of the Oak Island team together

17:51.111 --> 17:54.823
for an important meeting
in the war room.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.910
You know, I know
everyone's not here right now,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.619
but, um, I just...

17:59.619 --> 18:02.580
I do want to let everyone know.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.458
Uh, it's with a lot of sadness,

18:04.458 --> 18:08.628
for me especially,
that Zena has passed.

18:08.628 --> 18:09.712
Oh.

18:15.676 --> 18:19.013
NARRATOR: The news that Rick's
 close friend, Zena Halpern,

18:19.013 --> 18:22.976
has passed away at the age of
88 comes with great sadness

18:22.976 --> 18:25.103
for him
and the rest of the team.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.066
-Oh, my goodness.
-Hi, Zena.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.608
How wonderful to meet you.

18:30.608 --> 18:32.736
Wonderful to meet you.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.822
NARRATOR: The New York-based
 author and historian

18:34.822 --> 18:37.950
spent more than 50 years
researching possible journeys

18:37.950 --> 18:41.994
to North America by members
of the Knights Templar.

18:41.994 --> 18:45.874
Journeys that she was convinced
were made centuries before

18:45.874 --> 18:48.085
the so-called "discovery"
of the new world

18:48.085 --> 18:52.381
by Christopher Columbus
in 1492.

18:52.381 --> 18:56.468
Two years ago,
Zena presented Rick Lagina

18:56.468 --> 18:58.636
and the team with a number
of intriguing documents,

18:58.636 --> 19:01.932
including one
which she believed

19:01.932 --> 19:05.394
to be a 14th-century
Templar map of Oak Island.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.124
Zena had
very serious health issues, and

19:27.124 --> 19:28.875
her health was failing,
to be honest.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.211
As sad as we are
by Zena's passing,

19:31.211 --> 19:35.214
I am immensely grateful
for having met her.

19:35.214 --> 19:37.968
I can't speak highly enough
about her.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.721
Her life has certainly impacted
my own.

19:41.721 --> 19:46.643
She brought a lot to... not only

19:46.643 --> 19:49.855
from a research perspective,
but on a personal level.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.732
I found her
to be an incredible woman. Um...

19:52.732 --> 19:56.236
Rich Moats actually wrote
something that I think is

19:56.236 --> 20:00.115
very apt and-and very eloquent.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.784
-Well, didn't he work with her?
-He did work with her,

20:02.784 --> 20:05.871
and I would like to...
to read it.

20:05.871 --> 20:10.500
"My heart is heavy at the loss
of our dear friend, Zena.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.046
"She was a sweet but tough woman
in love with history.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.257
"I am comforted in believing
she now has all the answers

20:17.257 --> 20:20.093
"to all the questions she ever
had about history as she listens

20:20.093 --> 20:21.761
"to her creator.

20:21.761 --> 20:23.805
"She now knows the full history
of Oak Island

20:23.805 --> 20:27.392
"and what lies
below the beautiful surface.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.435
(voice breaking): "I am thankful
to have known her.

20:29.435 --> 20:31.438
"I love you, Zena.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.816
Rest, my dear friend."

20:37.611 --> 20:40.655
She was a lovely woman.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.786
Rick was visibly moved

20:45.786 --> 20:49.373
by the news
of Zena Halpern's passing.

20:49.373 --> 20:53.125
He had established
quite a bond with this woman.

20:53.125 --> 20:55.628
They must have been
kindred spirits somehow.

20:55.628 --> 20:57.881
My heart goes out to him
so much.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.509
Well, Rick, you know, I know
you had a very soft spot

21:00.509 --> 21:03.260
in your heart for her.
Everybody understands that.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.971
Her work was unfinished,

21:04.971 --> 21:07.557
but she was in a business
where her work would...

21:07.557 --> 21:09.433
-be unfinished.
-Never be finished. Right.

21:09.433 --> 21:12.311
And-and it's kind of a...
probably a happy thing.

21:12.311 --> 21:14.647
RICK:
She's been on

21:14.647 --> 21:18.484
that uncovering history road
for her entire life.

21:18.484 --> 21:21.654
And now the torch
has been passed

21:21.654 --> 21:24.324
to us, at least
in the Oak Island world.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.326
MARTY:
Yes.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.662
We, the living, carry on.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.622
-DAVE: That's right.
-MARTY: Yes.

21:37.962 --> 21:39.714
NARRATOR: Three days
 after learning the news

21:39.714 --> 21:41.465
of his friend's passing,

21:41.465 --> 21:45.511
Rick Lagina, along with
his nephew Peter Fornetti,

21:45.511 --> 21:48.515
travels some 800 miles
southwest of Oak Island

21:48.515 --> 21:50.558
to visit Zena's former home

21:50.558 --> 21:52.394
in Long Island, New York.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.395
RICK:
 Zena has bequeathed to me

21:54.395 --> 21:58.858
the contents of her research--
a lifetime's worth of research.

21:58.858 --> 22:01.486
And I'm quite humbled
by the fact

22:01.486 --> 22:03.320
that she feels that,
in our hands,

22:03.320 --> 22:05.323
her research will not falter.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.534
We will continue
to move it forward.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.536
Have you seen everything
that we're gonna see today?

22:09.536 --> 22:11.997
Absolutely not.
And that's why, you know,

22:11.997 --> 22:14.875
this is gonna prove
to be highly informative.

22:14.875 --> 22:18.045
I mean, Zena...
I have nothing but respect

22:18.045 --> 22:20.172
for what she accomplished
over her...

22:20.172 --> 22:22.507
the entirety of her career,

22:22.507 --> 22:24.925
but also as it relates
to our search.

22:34.978 --> 22:38.856
It's gonna be a bit emotional
for me. I will say that.

22:38.856 --> 22:42.443
-Let's go take a look.
-Let's take a look.

22:44.403 --> 22:47.949
For me, this is gonna be
a little tough.

22:47.949 --> 22:50.493
Are you ready?

22:52.537 --> 22:54.705
There we go.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.375
-Jason, I presume?
-Hi, there.

22:58.375 --> 22:59.795
-Yep. Rick, right?
-Yes, absolutely.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.296
-Nice to meet you.
-Peter.
-Hi, Rick.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.756
-Nice to meet you.
-Good to see you, brother.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.257
-My condolences.
-Thank you, bud. Thank you.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.425
-And to you, Jason.
-Thank you.

23:06.425 --> 23:09.261
-Condolences. Peter.
-Hi, buddy. Good to see you.

23:09.261 --> 23:11.431
Thank you. Come on in.

23:13.808 --> 23:17.104
-RICK: So far everything
looks quite familiar.
-So...

23:17.104 --> 23:18.855
RICK: It was amazing, you know,
to walk through here

23:18.855 --> 23:20.606
the first time I was here.

23:20.606 --> 23:22.442
The width and breadth

23:22.442 --> 23:25.945
of not only the passion she
brought to the research agenda,

23:25.945 --> 23:27.321
but the commitment.

23:27.321 --> 23:29.406
I got a little overwhelmed
at how much...

23:29.406 --> 23:31.617
you know, knowledge there was

23:31.617 --> 23:35.163
-in her head.
-Yeah, there's a lifetime
of commitment here.

23:35.163 --> 23:38.083
The hope is that there might be
some information here

23:38.083 --> 23:40.961
that we may be able to glean
which will further

23:40.961 --> 23:42.962
her research

23:42.962 --> 23:45.882
and her belief
in terms of what happened

23:45.882 --> 23:47.634
-on Oak Island.
-PETER: I think
that's everyone's hope.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.051
It's everyone's hope.

23:49.051 --> 23:50.636
Right.

23:50.636 --> 23:53.181
Where Zena's trail leads?
I don't know.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.976
Uh, where her research leads?
I don't know.

23:55.976 --> 23:59.145
But she wouldn't give up.
She was indomitable.

23:59.145 --> 24:00.939
So neither will we.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.817
So, everything here
on the floor,

24:04.817 --> 24:08.279
we went through. We made sure
this is all absolute research.

24:08.279 --> 24:11.700
Uh, you can see
a lot of the books

24:11.700 --> 24:15.077
with all of the-the Post-its

24:15.077 --> 24:16.788
and the notes.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.038
You don't see those kinds
of notes in my books.

24:18.038 --> 24:19.624
-Do you, Peter?
-No.

24:19.624 --> 24:23.127
(laughs) And, uh, then
there's still the closet

24:23.127 --> 24:25.838
-behind you.
-JASON: Yeah.
-RICK: Oh, yeah.

24:25.838 --> 24:27.798
-So, uh...
-PETER: I think
our next step here

24:27.798 --> 24:29.175
is to start looking
through things

24:29.175 --> 24:30.676
and start boxing up.

24:30.676 --> 24:33.680
That would be...
that would be, uh, the project.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.432
Yeah. (chuckles)

24:36.432 --> 24:38.184
RICK:
 Zena's passion

24:38.184 --> 24:40.936
was this work.
These rooms represent her life,

24:40.936 --> 24:43.315
and there's a lot
of information to be gleaned,

24:43.315 --> 24:46.483
some of it highly relevant
to the search

24:46.483 --> 24:48.403
here on Oak Island.

24:48.403 --> 24:52.449
My hope is that as we
unravel it, it will lead us

24:52.449 --> 24:55.242
to new discoveries,
new understandings

24:55.242 --> 24:58.704
of perhaps a Templar voyage
to the New World,

24:58.704 --> 25:00.749
perhaps including Oak Island.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.667
Uh, here's something here.

25:05.711 --> 25:07.881
This may be...

25:07.881 --> 25:11.718
-Well, this might be the book.
-Oh.

25:20.393 --> 25:23.188
There's a page in here.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.231
Right here.

25:25.231 --> 25:27.733
-DAVIN: Oh!
-Bingo.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.157
-DAVIN: Yeah, you see
 where the page is?
-RICK: Right here.

25:35.157 --> 25:37.035
-A page. Here, right here.
-DAVIN: Oh!

25:37.035 --> 25:38.327
There you go.

25:38.327 --> 25:40.204
Bingo.

25:40.204 --> 25:42.832
NARRATOR: At the home
 of late Oak Island researcher

25:42.832 --> 25:45.251
Zena Halpern
in Long Island, New York,

25:45.251 --> 25:47.586
Rick Lagina,
his nephew Peter Fornetti

25:47.586 --> 25:49.881
and Zena's son Davin,

25:49.881 --> 25:52.592
are pouring through
more than 50 years of research

25:52.592 --> 25:54.594
collected by the noted author

25:54.594 --> 25:57.763
during her lifetime--
research which Rick hopes

25:57.763 --> 25:59.723
may help him and his partners

25:59.723 --> 26:01.768
solve the Oak Island mystery.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.729
-RICK: What's been called
Zena's map.
-(Davin chuckles)

26:04.729 --> 26:07.773
And this is the formula cipher.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.611
They went to some trouble.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.195
Mm-hmm.

26:13.195 --> 26:15.990
RICK: We still
have to puzzle this out.

26:15.990 --> 26:19.451
The true meaning of the cipher,
the true meaning of the map.

26:19.451 --> 26:22.454
I want to make sure that these
get safely back to Oak Island,

26:22.454 --> 26:25.750
so we'll give these to Peter

26:25.750 --> 26:27.669
and, uh, make sure
he boxes these up.

26:27.669 --> 26:29.421
-Peter.
-PETER: Yep.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.881
RICK: These may
or may not hold secrets,

26:31.881 --> 26:34.049
but there is certainly
something intriguing about them.

26:34.049 --> 26:36.885
So we need to pack these up,
make sure they're safe.

26:36.885 --> 26:38.346
Okay.
I'll pack these up separate.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.346
RICK:
Perfect. Thanks.

26:43.309 --> 26:44.978
So much information.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.895
I mean, I-I think we discussed

26:46.895 --> 26:50.317
about whether or not there are
original documents here.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.318
Like-like that,
for instance, right there.

26:52.318 --> 26:55.822
That's... There's Templars
on the cover of that.

27:01.243 --> 27:03.788
I know what this is.

27:03.788 --> 27:07.000
I don't know
if it's in its entirety,

27:07.000 --> 27:11.587
but this is the Ralph de Sudeley
deposition of his trip

27:11.587 --> 27:13.173
to the New World.

27:13.173 --> 27:17.634
This is the Cremona Document
itself.

27:17.634 --> 27:19.220
This is at the core

27:19.220 --> 27:21.765
of your mother's research.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.682
NARRATOR:
 The Cremona Document?

27:23.682 --> 27:28.813
Discovered during the 1970s
in a church in Cremona, Italy,

27:28.813 --> 27:31.648
the so-called Cremona Document

27:31.648 --> 27:35.278
is a collection of maps,
ciphers and journal entries

27:35.278 --> 27:37.322
which are believed
to have been authored,

27:37.322 --> 27:39.656
in part, by the 12th-century
Templar knight

27:39.656 --> 27:41.701
Ralph de Sudeley.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.703
It describes his activity
at the Temple Mount

27:44.703 --> 27:46.623
in Jerusalem,
where he is believed

27:46.623 --> 27:50.210
to have discovered
priceless religious artifacts

27:50.210 --> 27:53.880
such as the Holy Grail
and the Ark of the Covenant.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.714
It also details a voyage

27:55.714 --> 27:57.967
that he made to North America

27:57.967 --> 28:01.221
with other members
of the Knights Templar.

28:01.221 --> 28:05.307
Although many mainstream
historians remain skeptical

28:05.307 --> 28:07.852
as to the Cremona Document's
authenticity,

28:07.852 --> 28:09.561
Rick Lagina is convinced

28:09.561 --> 28:12.065
that much of the information
contained within it

28:12.065 --> 28:14.358
is most likely true.

28:14.358 --> 28:17.237
RICK:
 That document led Zena

28:17.237 --> 28:20.323
to connections to Oak Island,

28:20.323 --> 28:22.075
and that needs to be
followed up on.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.201
But as of yet, we don't have
a complete understanding.

28:24.201 --> 28:27.247
Look, I can't tell you

28:27.247 --> 28:28.580
what you already know.

28:28.580 --> 28:30.333
She was a wonderful lady,

28:30.333 --> 28:33.836
and hopefully her passion
and her interest and her life

28:33.836 --> 28:36.381
is still here
within these volumes.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.508
I hope we can do this justice.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.593
I hope we can follow the trail

28:40.593 --> 28:43.011
-she's led us on.
-Absolutely.

28:43.011 --> 28:46.348
And I-I would like to just
thank you for acknowledging her.

28:46.348 --> 28:49.102
And I'm just so thrilled to know

28:49.102 --> 28:52.439
that her life's work
isn't just gonna stop right now.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.606
I guarantee you
it's not gonna stop, Davin.

28:54.606 --> 28:56.859
Jason, it's not gonna stop.
She wouldn't allow it

28:56.859 --> 28:58.153
to stop and we won't, either.

29:00.571 --> 29:02.740
-Thank you, bud.
-Yep.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.366
Take care.

29:11.039 --> 29:13.375
NARRATOR:
 The next day,

29:13.375 --> 29:15.211
following his emotional trip

29:15.211 --> 29:18.338
to collect materials
left to him by Zena Halpern...

29:18.338 --> 29:19.923
-Morning, guys.
-Morning.
-Gentlemen.

29:19.923 --> 29:22.218
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina
 joins Craig Tester

29:22.218 --> 29:24.345
and other members
of the Oak Island team

29:24.345 --> 29:26.138
at the Money Pit site.

29:26.138 --> 29:29.476
Now that drilling has begun
at a second location,

29:29.476 --> 29:31.644
they are hopeful
they will soon reach

29:31.644 --> 29:33.896
a mysterious 30-foot-wide void

29:33.896 --> 29:37.733
located at a depth
of some 170 feet

29:37.733 --> 29:41.778
and which was identified
earlier by seismic scanning.

29:41.778 --> 29:46.159
In picking this location, H-7.5,

29:46.159 --> 29:49.328
it is close in proximity
to H-8, where we don't have

29:49.328 --> 29:51.498
an understanding
of what happened.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.082
We certainly retrieved

29:53.082 --> 29:56.001
some very interesting items
from H-8.

29:56.001 --> 29:58.296
The hope is that
we can replicate those finds,

29:58.296 --> 30:01.758
maybe find something
in addition to those.

30:01.758 --> 30:06.179
TERRY:
The much talked about H-7.5.

30:06.179 --> 30:09.223
I pulled out H-8 from last year.

30:09.223 --> 30:11.433
Very, you know, interesting
and important hole that spawned

30:11.433 --> 30:13.394
-the large diameter caisson.
-Yeah.

30:13.394 --> 30:16.105
And today we're very close
with that one.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.773
We're into open ground

30:17.773 --> 30:19.651
that hasn't had
any real information on it,

30:19.651 --> 30:22.819
you know, plus or minus
five feet away from it.

30:22.819 --> 30:25.781
We've got a really
relatively virgin target

30:25.781 --> 30:27.659
very close to what I think
is the Money Pit.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.410
This should be interesting.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.458
You know, considering
what came out of H-8,

30:35.458 --> 30:38.461
this should be a real hot zone
for artifacts.

30:43.048 --> 30:45.718
So, where are we, guys?

30:45.718 --> 30:47.636
CRAIG:
Uh, 159.

30:47.636 --> 30:49.556
We ran the casing down to 158

30:49.556 --> 30:52.182
to seal it... seal it off.

30:52.182 --> 30:53.351
I wanted to make sure
we didn't have

30:53.351 --> 30:55.019
any more slumping from above.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.855
So anything that slumps now
will be at the bottom.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.982
But it's been advancing
quite well.

30:59.982 --> 31:04.362
If we can really keep open hole
till 210, it'd be interesting

31:04.362 --> 31:06.154
where this ends up.

31:06.154 --> 31:08.449
We'll find out.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.035
NARRATOR:
 Using a specialized sonic rig,

31:11.035 --> 31:12.537
the Choice Drilling team

31:12.537 --> 31:14.372
will extract core samples
of earth--

31:14.372 --> 31:17.083
and any objects
contained within--

31:17.083 --> 31:19.544
at intervals every ten feet.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.628
These samples
will then be transferred

31:21.628 --> 31:23.381
into a plastic sleeve

31:23.381 --> 31:26.384
so that they can be
carefully examined by hand

31:26.384 --> 31:29.511
for any important clues
or possible treasure.

31:29.511 --> 31:31.847
CHARLES:
Oh, here we go.

31:33.057 --> 31:36.685
-What depth, Brennan?
-160.

31:39.188 --> 31:42.191
TERRY: That's really gravelly,
but it's mostly limestone.

31:42.191 --> 31:45.236
See that tan color?
That's limestone.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.529
And there's silt, there's, uh,

31:47.529 --> 31:50.450
you know, organics in there.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.868
CRAIG:
What is that?

31:55.454 --> 31:56.705
TERRY:
That's weird.

31:56.705 --> 31:58.833
I think this is coconut fiber.

32:04.588 --> 32:07.342
CRAIG:
 I think this is coconut fiber.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.469
TERRY:
That's really interesting.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.304
NARRATOR: At the Money Pit,
 while searching

32:11.304 --> 32:15.599
the spoils of the exploratory
borehole known as H-7.5,

32:15.599 --> 32:17.602
Rick Lagina, Craig Tester

32:17.602 --> 32:20.188
and members
of the Oak Island team

32:20.188 --> 32:23.691
have just made
an amazing discovery.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.317
When you look
at the historical records,

32:25.317 --> 32:27.653
they did find, you know,
what they believed to be

32:27.653 --> 32:31.657
coconut fiber in the Money Pit
when they were excavating it,

32:31.657 --> 32:33.576
so it's not beyond the realm
of possibility.

32:35.202 --> 32:37.204
Exactly. Exactly.

32:37.204 --> 32:38.623
NARRATOR
 Coconut fiber?

32:38.623 --> 32:39.999
In the Money Pit?

32:39.999 --> 32:43.502
160 feet deep
below the surface?

32:43.502 --> 32:46.047
But if so,
how did it get there,

32:46.047 --> 32:48.007
and why?

32:48.007 --> 32:51.719
In 1804, when the Money Pit
was excavated

32:51.719 --> 32:54.846
by the Onslow Company,
searchers reported finding

32:54.846 --> 32:59.559
a large amount of coconut fiber
at a depth of 60 feet.

32:59.559 --> 33:01.354
Given that
the nearest coconut trees

33:01.354 --> 33:05.566
are located some 1,500 miles
south of Nova Scotia,

33:05.566 --> 33:09.487
they concluded that it had been
used to make a kind of rope

33:09.487 --> 33:12.824
that would enable depositors to
lower something of great value

33:12.824 --> 33:14.575
down into the shaft.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.203
Could the discovery
of coconut fiber

33:18.203 --> 33:21.708
be an important indication
that Rick, Marty and the team

33:21.708 --> 33:25.711
have finally located the site
of the original Money Pit?

33:25.711 --> 33:27.087
RICK:
 You know, coconut fiber

33:27.087 --> 33:29.214
has been found at depth
in the Money Pit.

33:29.214 --> 33:31.592
If this indeed is coconut fiber,

33:31.592 --> 33:33.552
it makes this location
much more relevant

33:33.552 --> 33:36.221
in terms
of further search agenda.

33:36.221 --> 33:38.557
Whether that means a large can

33:38.557 --> 33:40.351
or additional drilling,
I don't know.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.060
Certainly a very unique find.

33:42.060 --> 33:43.730
It's certainly worth testing.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.522
TERRY:
That wood's been cut.

33:45.522 --> 33:47.442
Look, you can see that ax.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.859
See that?

33:48.859 --> 33:50.819
-Yeah.
-Somebody's hit these things

33:50.819 --> 33:53.405
with an ax-- you can see
the bevel of the ax.

33:53.405 --> 33:55.199
-This is interesting.
-What are we at again

33:55.199 --> 33:56.576
at the top here? One...?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.411
-CHARLES: 171.
-171.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.079
NARRATOR:
 Ax-cut wood?

34:01.079 --> 34:05.585
Found approximately
170 feet deep underground,

34:05.585 --> 34:09.213
and nearly the same depth
where recent seismic scanning

34:09.213 --> 34:11.922
revealed a mysterious
30-foot-wide chamber?

34:13.760 --> 34:18.347
Could the Oak Island team have
just discovered solid evidence

34:18.347 --> 34:20.099
of the legendary
Chappell Vault?

34:20.099 --> 34:21.768
CRAIG:
We are going to want

34:21.768 --> 34:24.561
to bag and tag these pieces
of wood in through here.

34:24.561 --> 34:27.398
TERRY: That is quite a bit
of limestone-rich material.

34:27.398 --> 34:32.235
Matrix. There's also
very large, rounded clasts.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.905
We've never seen
anything like that.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.280
And this minced-up stuff here,

34:35.280 --> 34:37.574
that's... really interesting.

34:37.574 --> 34:40.619
RICK: It's as though
this collected somehow,

34:40.619 --> 34:42.413
in, like, in the corner

34:42.413 --> 34:44.791
of something or in the crevice
of something, you know?

34:44.791 --> 34:47.543
-CRAIG: Right.
-Otherwise this would be mixed.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.835
RICK:
 You know, I wish

34:48.835 --> 34:52.255
I could make
a very firm statement

34:52.255 --> 34:56.427
whenever we drill that,
okay, we're in this structure

34:56.427 --> 34:59.304
or we're in this shaft,
or we're in this wall,

34:59.304 --> 35:01.891
but we don't know
the underground.

35:01.891 --> 35:05.728
That has been proven to us
over and over and over again.

35:05.728 --> 35:08.231
At this point,
we have a lot of data

35:08.231 --> 35:10.817
and coring samples
that we've brought up.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.820
And from that,
maybe then get an understanding

35:13.820 --> 35:17.322
of how these
wood structures align.

35:17.322 --> 35:19.659
That's my hope.

35:19.659 --> 35:23.036
But how we pursue it,
I don't know as of yet.

35:23.036 --> 35:25.289
You have to have faith
that what you're doing is right.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.873
I mean, like
all the searchers before,

35:26.873 --> 35:29.168
I mean, it was always
the next day, the next hole,

35:29.168 --> 35:31.003
the next ten feet of the shaft.

35:31.003 --> 35:33.672
If you don't believe that,
then it's time to go home.

35:33.672 --> 35:36.884
When it gets tough, I go back
to Bobby Restall's journal.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.677
"We made two inches today."

35:38.677 --> 35:40.179
-Yeah.
-And they were happy.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.889
-Yeah.
-Yeah, we came up dry,

35:41.889 --> 35:43.974
but we tried,
and we didn't quit,

35:43.974 --> 35:45.684
-and neither did they.
-Nope.

35:57.195 --> 35:59.699
NARRATOR: After a day
 of exciting new discoveries

35:59.699 --> 36:02.367
at the Oak Island Money Pit,

36:02.367 --> 36:04.704
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

36:04.704 --> 36:07.873
gather with the rest
of the team in the war room

36:07.873 --> 36:09.708
where they eagerly await
a report

36:09.708 --> 36:13.545
on one of their
most exciting recent finds.

36:13.545 --> 36:16.257
So, guys, what I'm hoping
we'll learn today

36:16.257 --> 36:18.342
is a significant discovery,

36:18.342 --> 36:22.889
an item that we named...

36:22.889 --> 36:24.891
very preliminarily,
a crossbow bolt.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.018
And so I had asked Doug
to reach out

36:27.018 --> 36:32.523
to an antiquities expert and get
an evaluation of the object.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.108
And I think, I hope,
that we're in

36:34.108 --> 36:37.277
for a very interesting
revelation.

36:37.277 --> 36:39.237
So, Doug, where are we?

36:39.237 --> 36:42.699
Well, we reached out to Gabriel
Vandervort in California,

36:42.699 --> 36:45.077
an antiquities expert,
and I think we

36:45.077 --> 36:47.329
should hear from him
what he has to say.

36:49.081 --> 36:51.333
-MARTY: Hello. Hi, Gabriel.
-Hi.

36:51.333 --> 36:52.918
-Hi, Gabriel.
-How you doing?

36:52.918 --> 36:54.210
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

36:54.210 --> 36:55.922
I'm well. Thank you.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.923
Lots of interesting stuff
behind you there,

36:57.923 --> 36:59.507
-that's for sure.
-Uh, yeah.

36:59.507 --> 37:02.094
I'm a specialist here.
I deal in everything

37:02.094 --> 37:03.596
from ancient Mesopotamia

37:03.596 --> 37:05.806
through the medieval
and Crusades period.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.434
-Perfect.
-RICK: So, Doug
has reached out to you.

37:09.434 --> 37:13.521
I guess we're very much looking
forward to your analysis.

37:13.521 --> 37:16.733
Yes. I, uh,
I've taken a look at this piece.

37:16.733 --> 37:18.318
It is extremely interesting.

37:18.318 --> 37:21.322
I spent quite a bit of time
on it, actually.

37:22.572 --> 37:24.367
When I first saw it...

37:24.367 --> 37:28.579
my first instinct was that it
was from the medieval period,

37:28.579 --> 37:30.664
from Europe.

37:30.664 --> 37:33.000
-That's what he said.
-RICK: Gary.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.628
-Yeah, that's his first...
-GABRIEL: The, uh, tip,

37:35.628 --> 37:38.130
the pure metal tip was...

37:38.130 --> 37:40.132
part of a lot
of medieval weaponry,

37:40.132 --> 37:44.762
like crossbow bolts, but not
with such a long neck like that.

37:44.762 --> 37:49.976
So I went through
just dozens of references,

37:49.976 --> 37:51.978
really couldn't find it,

37:51.978 --> 37:53.938
couldn't nail it down
to the medieval period.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.815
So I started going back in time.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.818
-And, uh...
-Back in time?

37:58.818 --> 38:00.735
what it appears to be...

38:02.822 --> 38:05.157
...is Roman.

38:05.157 --> 38:07.076
-No way!
-ALEX: No way!

38:07.076 --> 38:08.827
This type
of Roman weapon was used

38:08.827 --> 38:11.539
from the Roman Republican
period, first century BC,

38:11.539 --> 38:13.958
up through
the fifth century AD.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.543
That is unbelievable.

38:16.543 --> 38:19.005
Two words: Roman, baby!

38:19.005 --> 38:20.005
(laughter)

38:20.005 --> 38:22.842
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.427
What it appears to be
is the type of Roman javelin

38:25.427 --> 38:27.804
called a pilum.

38:27.804 --> 38:29.806
NARRATOR:
 A Roman pilum?

38:29.806 --> 38:32.809
Dating back as far
as the first century BC,

38:32.809 --> 38:36.021
more than 2,000 years ago?

38:36.021 --> 38:40.568
Commonly carried by the
legionnaires of ancient Rome,

38:40.568 --> 38:44.280
a pilum was a type
of throwing spear,

38:44.280 --> 38:46.574
also known as a javelin.

38:46.574 --> 38:50.036
Although the shaft
was made of wood,

38:50.036 --> 38:52.996
the tip was made
of a very hard iron,

38:52.996 --> 38:55.166
which could pierce
through body armor.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.835
It also featured
a long, thin neck,

38:57.835 --> 39:01.213
designed to break off
inside the body of its victim,

39:01.213 --> 39:04.215
causing a fatal wound.

39:04.215 --> 39:06.802
GABRIEL:
I found a reference to it,

39:06.802 --> 39:09.972
if I could show you. Um...

39:11.347 --> 39:13.266
We're looking at that
right there.

39:15.018 --> 39:17.021
And you've got
about the top third

39:17.021 --> 39:19.106
of that weapon right there.

39:19.106 --> 39:21.900
It was a sophisticated weapon
in the Roman period,

39:21.900 --> 39:23.777
but it really wasn't something

39:23.777 --> 39:25.403
that was used after that.
It's well-made.

39:25.403 --> 39:26.739
It's well-preserved.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.157
These are rare
to be found like this.

39:29.157 --> 39:31.494
Yeah, even rarer
in North America.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.746
MARTY:
 Everybody's jaw

39:33.746 --> 39:35.748
in the room dropped
when Gabriel,

39:35.748 --> 39:37.750
the antiquities expert,
said that his best guess

39:37.750 --> 39:39.126
is that it was

39:39.126 --> 39:40.753
what's called a Roman pilum.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.545
Roman! Okay? Roman.

39:42.545 --> 39:44.590
That's, you know,
pushing back...

39:44.590 --> 39:46.425
(chuckles)
...a long ways.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.094
I'm not sure what to make of it.

39:48.094 --> 39:52.806
It's so outside the box
of our current belief.

39:52.806 --> 39:55.393
I mean, the idea that

39:55.393 --> 39:58.686
we still don't know what had
transpired here on the island,

39:58.686 --> 40:01.398
I mean, it's incredible.

40:01.398 --> 40:04.068
GABRIEL: There's no reason
I could imagine that

40:04.068 --> 40:06.737
something like this would
have been found on Oak Island.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.780
-Nor can we.
-Yeah, neither can we.

40:08.780 --> 40:11.074
GABRIEL: You know, unless it
was brought over as part of...

40:11.074 --> 40:13.244
some kind of a cache of weapons,

40:13.244 --> 40:15.454
or-or-or...
you know, antiquities,

40:15.454 --> 40:18.081
even at the time,
at a much later time.

40:18.081 --> 40:20.458
What does that make you feel
about Oak Island?

40:20.458 --> 40:21.543
(chuckling)

40:21.543 --> 40:23.045
Very intrigued.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.465
Very, very intrigued.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.967
Welcome to our world.

40:28.967 --> 40:30.969
MARTY: We're all just sitting
here with our mouths open.

40:30.969 --> 40:32.972
So we got to digest this
a little bit.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.597
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

40:34.597 --> 40:36.559
Appreciate your time.
Thank you very much.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.101
GABRIEL:
You're welcome. Take care.

40:40.019 --> 40:43.648
Gentlemen, I think it's time
to take a deep breath

40:43.648 --> 40:45.275
and think about all this.

40:45.275 --> 40:48.653
And we also all have
a lot to do, so...

40:48.653 --> 40:50.947
let's go.

40:50.947 --> 40:54.242
â™ª â™ª

40:54.242 --> 40:57.371
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
 and the Oak Island team,

40:57.371 --> 41:01.500
it has been a week
of emotional highs...

41:01.500 --> 41:05.170
and heartbreaking lows.

41:05.170 --> 41:07.380
A week that underscored

41:07.380 --> 41:10.134
the need for both patience

41:10.134 --> 41:12.052
and perseverance.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.137
â™ª â™ª

41:14.137 --> 41:18.099
It also served
as a solemn reminder

41:18.099 --> 41:20.311
that life is short...

41:22.103 --> 41:25.940
...and the time to solve
the Oak Island mystery...

41:26.983 --> 41:28.443
...is now.

41:28.443 --> 41:30.112
â™ª â™ª

41:36.284 --> 41:38.369
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:38.369 --> 41:41.039
RICK: Maybe today
 we'll find the one thing.

41:41.039 --> 41:43.041
I think we're right on target
for that tunnel.

41:43.041 --> 41:45.085
TERRY:
 Keep your eyes peeled, guys.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.378
-GARY: Sweet!
-JACK: What is that?

41:47.378 --> 41:50.382
We found a copy
of the Cremona Document.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.967
RICK:
 That document will lead us

41:51.967 --> 41:54.427
to a Templar voyage
to the New World,

41:54.427 --> 41:56.179
including Oak Island.

41:56.179 --> 41:58.891
MARTY: We have the first
 evidence the French were here.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.559
-TERRY: Whoa!
-CHARLES: What do you got?

42:00.559 --> 42:03.269
CRAIG: I think you hit
the tunnel from Shaft Six.
