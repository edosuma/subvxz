00:40.000 --> 00:42.935
I wanna be a ballerina.
That's always been my dream.

00:43.455 --> 00:47.350
<i>My mom always said that I did
pirouettes before I even started walking.</i>

00:48.033 --> 00:51.262
And I did them and I fell on my butt.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.484
<i>I had a little ballerina on my nightstand,</i>

00:55.584 --> 00:58.900
and I think this was my first idea
why I wanted to become a ballerina,

00:59.009 --> 01:01.246
'cause I never knew that ballet existed.

01:02.657 --> 01:03.933
<i>I love hip-hop.</i>

01:04.033 --> 01:08.222
<i>Missy, Jay-Z, Common,
N.W.A., Kanye West.</i>

01:08.321 --> 01:12.893
Hip-hop allows you to let go
and follow the beat.

01:14.721 --> 01:18.780
<i>I think the biggest difference between
ballet and hip-hop is the posture.</i>

01:19.074 --> 01:21.310
<i>That settling into your body in hip-hop,</i>

01:21.409 --> 01:24.704
whereas ballet,
it's just about flying and flowing.

01:25.826 --> 01:28.695
I love kissing.
Stuffed pizza, are you kidding?

01:28.929 --> 01:30.107
Wrigley Field.

01:30.210 --> 01:33.057
Maybe dancing and kissing,
the same time.

01:33.314 --> 01:37.275
The lake, my friends and my dad.
Oh, my God, my dad, Roy...

01:37.378 --> 01:39.995
Trumpet. He's a trumpet player.
Trumpet.

01:41.409 --> 01:46.396
And this necklace. It's from my mom.
She gave it to me for luck.

02:06.339 --> 02:08.443
<i>It's not too much leaving home,</i>

02:08.545 --> 02:10.586
'cause I'm really excited
to go to New York,

02:10.691 --> 02:11.803
but it's the not knowing.

02:12.482 --> 02:14.206
Not knowing what's gonna happen,

02:14.306 --> 02:16.990
not knowing the people
who are gonna be in my life.

02:35.139 --> 02:37.561
My boyfriend and I decided
to see other people,

02:37.667 --> 02:40.569
because he's studying somewhere
and I'm here in New York,

02:40.676 --> 02:42.236
and it's probably better this way.

02:42.340 --> 02:43.801
My ankles are a little weak,

02:43.908 --> 02:46.461
and my turnout could be
probably a little better.

02:49.508 --> 02:51.166
Oh, it hurts so much.

02:51.685 --> 02:54.554
Don't you want me to do, like,
a pirouette or something?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.175
<i>This is what I've been doing
my whole life,</i>

03:06.277 --> 03:09.506
and honestly I don't think
I had time to do anything else,

03:10.277 --> 03:11.586
besides kissing.

03:12.645 --> 03:15.579
<i>I'm gonna be working really,
really hard to be the best.</i>

03:15.685 --> 03:17.758
<i>And you won't be disappointed in me.</i>

03:18.885 --> 03:21.502
<i>There are not gonna be
better dancers than me there.</i>

03:21.604 --> 03:23.579
<i>I'm going to be the best.</i>

03:23.685 --> 03:26.980
<i>And if there are,
they should just wait and see.</i>

03:27.109 --> 03:28.516
That's right.

03:29.797 --> 03:31.139
That's right.

03:48.838 --> 03:50.300
Hey, that was awesome.

03:50.405 --> 03:52.577
- What do you call that?
- An attitude.

03:52.678 --> 03:53.856
Oh, neat.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.162
- Are you Zoe?
- Uh-huh.

03:56.262 --> 03:57.756
I'm Sara.

03:58.566 --> 03:59.875
Yes, you'll do.

04:01.671 --> 04:02.848
Okay...

04:02.950 --> 04:04.444
You brought this
all the way from Texas?

04:04.551 --> 04:05.663
Yes.

04:05.894 --> 04:08.862
In Texas,
we have something called "gentlemen."

04:08.999 --> 04:11.716
I think I got something called a "hernia."

04:12.198 --> 04:14.533
How did you get it here
in the first place?

04:14.662 --> 04:16.036
Some horny cellist.

04:18.087 --> 04:20.476
Why don't we take some stuff out?
It will be easier to carry.

04:20.582 --> 04:23.681
Yes, that is an excellent idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

04:26.119 --> 04:29.949
Okay, that's my jewelry,
that's my top hat.

04:30.791 --> 04:32.318
That's Hamlet.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.257
I've always suspected
Ken was a serial killer.

04:49.512 --> 04:52.643
<i>Each of you has been blessed
with a unique gift.</i>

04:53.544 --> 04:56.773
- Trombone.
- What?

04:56.872 --> 04:59.741
I got this thing where I can look at
somebody, I can tell what they do.

04:59.848 --> 05:02.630
And you are a trombonista.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.593
Well, maybe your thing is broken,
'cause I'm here for ballet.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.868
What? You trying to be a ballerina?

05:09.032 --> 05:13.058
I am a ballerina.
I'm trying to become a prima ballerina.

05:14.696 --> 05:18.046
Well, you are kind of prima,
but you don't look like a ballerina.

05:18.153 --> 05:20.575
You've got the soul
of a trombone player.

05:20.681 --> 05:22.242
It's in the eyes.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.128
I...

05:25.194 --> 05:27.168
I'm Miles and you are...

05:29.833 --> 05:33.609
<i>From our ballet department,
Miss Monique Delacroix.</i>

05:34.057 --> 05:36.064
- You mind?
- I mind what?

05:36.169 --> 05:39.300
Turning that down.
I'm trying to hear Miss Delacroix.

05:41.673 --> 05:45.153
And by the way, the remix is way better.

05:48.074 --> 05:51.423
<i>Although I'm sure it's true
you're the best and brightest</i>

05:52.041 --> 05:54.911
<i>that your former schools
and teachers had to offer,</i>

05:55.338 --> 05:58.687
<i>I regret having to dash
your dreams of a meteoric rise</i>

05:58.794 --> 06:02.372
<i>to the pinnacle of artistic success
and world renown.</i>

06:04.490 --> 06:06.400
<i>By Juilliard choosing you,</i>

06:07.562 --> 06:08.663
<i>the bar's been raised.</i>

06:08.697 --> 06:09.765
<i>the bar's been raised.</i>

06:10.442 --> 06:15.363
<i>For the next four years,
you must strive for perfection.</i>

06:17.290 --> 06:19.178
<i>Please look to your left</i>

06:21.290 --> 06:22.752
<i>and your right.</i>

06:25.835 --> 06:30.341
<i>Only one in three of you
will go on to a life of fulfillment</i>

06:30.986 --> 06:32.841
<i>in the mastery of your art.</i>

06:34.187 --> 06:38.410
<i>The other two will probably end up
stocking books at Barnes & Noble</i>

06:38.571 --> 06:41.920
<i>or working behind a cosmetic counter
in Buffalo.</i>

06:46.699 --> 06:48.488
<i>Welcome to Juilliard.</i>

06:51.147 --> 06:52.096
Thanks.

06:52.204 --> 06:55.587
Oh, my God!
How pretentious can you get?

06:55.691 --> 06:59.620
I mean, I know she's your idol, you have
the poster over the bed and all but...

06:59.724 --> 07:01.829
Monique Delacroix has danced the lead

07:01.931 --> 07:03.907
with every major ballet company
in the world.

07:04.012 --> 07:05.256
She was a principal

07:05.356 --> 07:07.494
at the American Ballet Theatre
for 15 years.

07:07.596 --> 07:09.254
- Whatever.
- What?

07:09.357 --> 07:12.204
You wanna wind up working
in a cosmetics counter in Buffalo?

07:12.301 --> 07:13.643
The women in my family don't work.

07:13.740 --> 07:16.293
They drink martinis,
and they get face-lifts.

07:16.396 --> 07:18.306
Me, I just wanna act

07:18.413 --> 07:22.057
and leave the world domination
to you and Mistress Delacroix.

07:23.629 --> 07:26.596
Oh, my God. There's my mentor.

07:26.701 --> 07:29.068
He's beautiful. I hate him.

07:29.165 --> 07:32.034
I better go and pay my respects.
See you.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.072
- Hi.
- Hello.

07:49.773 --> 07:54.148
Hi. I'm Sara, your mentee.

07:54.894 --> 07:58.309
Well, sit down
before that tray tips you over.

08:00.621 --> 08:05.258
- So, Sara, you any good?
- Yes. But isn't everybody?

08:05.710 --> 08:07.882
We wouldn't be here if we weren't.

08:12.110 --> 08:13.452
See you.

08:18.191 --> 08:19.783
- Bye.
- Okay.

08:20.206 --> 08:22.923
I'll watch out for you as best I can.

08:23.215 --> 08:27.011
But for the most part,
you're on your own.

08:28.622 --> 08:30.728
So we're all
totally freaking wasted, right?

08:30.831 --> 08:33.220
And guess
who gets on the freaking elevator?

08:33.326 --> 08:36.261
- Do you pluck your eyebrows?
- What?

08:36.879 --> 08:39.335
Your eyebrows,
where do you get them done?

08:41.294 --> 08:43.880
Round the corner on 9th,
at the Chinese place.

08:43.982 --> 08:44.931
Cool.

08:45.039 --> 08:48.933
Never ever date an actor.
All they wanna do is screw ballerinas.

08:49.039 --> 08:50.152
It's like a fetish.

08:50.255 --> 08:53.190
Besides, when you dump them,
they're such drama queens.

08:54.287 --> 08:56.743
So do you have a boyfriend?

08:57.552 --> 08:59.440
Yes. Well, no.

08:59.632 --> 09:02.350
He's in premed at Georgetown,
and I'm here.

09:02.513 --> 09:04.203
We decided we could date
other people...

09:04.304 --> 09:06.987
Forget about him. It's for the best.

09:07.312 --> 09:09.548
Honestly, there's
maybe seven ballet companies

09:09.648 --> 09:11.055
worth dancing for in the world.

09:11.153 --> 09:13.225
That means you have to stay focused.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.499
Boyfriends, they just get in the way.

09:26.609 --> 09:30.057
My God, this summer in Paris,
I was like the ugly American

09:30.161 --> 09:32.812
<i>because my sissonne ouverte
wasn't grande enough.</i>

09:34.128 --> 09:36.136
Who'd you take class with?

09:36.688 --> 09:38.183
- Me?
- Yes, you.

09:38.385 --> 09:40.873
The Chicago Ballet with Uri Pell.

09:40.977 --> 09:44.238
Oh, I know him. He's kind of out there.

09:44.754 --> 09:47.273
If you mean progressive,
yeah, he's kind of out there.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.673
He did the thing where everybody
was like keys on a typewriter.

09:51.377 --> 09:52.783
Were you in that?

09:52.881 --> 09:55.369
Sara, come with me for a moment.

10:00.177 --> 10:02.665
- Stand here.
- Why?

10:15.442 --> 10:17.514
- What's your name?
- Sara.

10:19.282 --> 10:20.940
Sara Johnson.

10:23.026 --> 10:27.336
You'd all do well to follow
Miss Johnson's example.

10:28.243 --> 10:30.511
Class begins at 9:30 sharp,

10:30.610 --> 10:35.946
which means that 9:29 you should all
be stretched and waiting for my arrival.

10:50.835 --> 10:53.105
And you, what's your name?

10:53.363 --> 10:57.226
- Marcus.
- Marcus, what is this place?

10:58.772 --> 11:02.633
- A dance studio?
- No, it's a cathedral.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.689
In this room dwells the entire
spiritual history of our species.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.150
How can you hope
to be part of that, Marcus,

11:11.283 --> 11:15.440
while wearing trousers that go "whish,
whish" every time you take a step?

11:16.180 --> 11:17.740
- I...
- You can't.

11:18.644 --> 11:22.800
Not one article of vinyl clothing
is to cross that threshold.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.289
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

11:28.116 --> 11:29.099
- Morning, Bella.
- Morning.

11:29.204 --> 11:30.152
Morning.

11:33.461 --> 11:38.000
You will be divided into three lines
based on your abilities.

11:40.053 --> 11:42.257
We will do this in every class.

11:44.053 --> 11:48.047
If you find yourself in line number three
more than five weeks,

11:49.302 --> 11:51.538
you will be asked to leave the program.

11:54.549 --> 11:56.721
Please line up at the long bar.

11:57.269 --> 11:58.676
Marcus,

11:59.862 --> 12:01.106
third line.

12:01.270 --> 12:03.342
Bella. Please.

12:04.021 --> 12:06.739
We'll begin with pliés.

12:15.254 --> 12:16.530
What happened to your eye?

12:16.631 --> 12:19.565
I was in circus class, I fell off my stilts.

12:20.662 --> 12:23.662
Is that something you should be doing
on a first day?

12:23.895 --> 12:27.091
Welcome to
Introduction to Hip-Hop Theory.

12:27.670 --> 12:28.178
Oh, my God.

12:28.212 --> 12:28.687
Oh, my God.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.540
What? You're the one
who made us take this class.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.950
My name is Miles Sultana,
and I am not your professor.

12:36.758 --> 12:40.468
Your actual professor was trying to ball
with us young bucks up in the Bronx,

12:40.567 --> 12:42.956
decided to go all half-man,
half-amazing to the hole.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.227
Needless to say he pulled his hammy.
I laughed 'cause it was funny

12:46.327 --> 12:47.669
until he fell to the ground,

12:47.767 --> 12:49.938
and his leg bent backwards
and snapped in three places.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.665
This school is dangerous.

12:52.087 --> 12:56.626
So here I am filling in for him until he...
Well, if he gets back.

12:56.918 --> 13:00.977
So with the help of my good friend
Franz here and his instrument,

13:01.079 --> 13:04.658
we are going to explore
the nature of hip-hop within us all.

13:06.136 --> 13:09.452
All right. So, hip-hop theory.

13:10.328 --> 13:11.855
What is hip-hop?

13:15.224 --> 13:17.558
Ah, Trombonista.

13:20.728 --> 13:22.222
<i>Hip-hop is the convergence</i>

13:22.329 --> 13:25.046
<i>of the electronic musical movement
and urban youth culture</i>

13:25.144 --> 13:28.276
<i>which happened after the world
discovered that disco sucked.</i>

13:30.009 --> 13:32.791
Good answer.
I ain't giving up my Bee Gees.

13:33.849 --> 13:34.897
<i>Hip-hop is...</i>

13:35.001 --> 13:36.048
<i>- It's rap.
- You know what I'm saying?</i>

13:36.152 --> 13:37.135
<i>Hip-hop is...</i>

13:37.240 --> 13:38.189
Soul.

13:38.297 --> 13:39.246
<i>Hip-hop is...</i>

13:39.353 --> 13:40.335
R & B.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.368
<i>Hip-hop is...</i>

13:41.465 --> 13:44.726
Funk. For most people today,
hip-hop is about bling-bling.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.799
But what was before the bling-bling?

13:46.905 --> 13:50.647
What was before the Escalades,
and the nine millys and the hoochies?

13:57.497 --> 13:58.425
<i>Hip-hop is...</i>

13:58.521 --> 13:59.928
It's a form
of cross-cultural communication.

14:00.025 --> 14:02.480
<i>- Hip-hop is...
- It's a lifestyle, a language, a fashion.</i>

14:02.586 --> 14:04.342
<i>- Hip-hip is...
- It's simple and complex.</i>

14:04.441 --> 14:07.224
It's about a individual
questioning the establishment.

14:07.321 --> 14:10.550
It's about recombining, combining
everything that came before.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.494
Hip-hop is about finding a new voice.

14:13.593 --> 14:17.075
But what hip-hop really is can be
summed up in three simple words.

14:17.338 --> 14:19.345
I am here.

14:24.025 --> 14:25.684
It was so rad

14:25.787 --> 14:27.696
the way you like looped
my roomie's words,

14:27.802 --> 14:29.363
then you made a song out of it.

14:29.466 --> 14:32.433
Thanks.
So did your roomie think so, too?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.065
You could have told me
you were a teacher.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.756
- I'm not.
- Okay, a guest lecturer then.

14:36.954 --> 14:39.443
- I thought you were an actor.
- An actor. Why?

14:40.058 --> 14:41.302
Never mind.

14:41.498 --> 14:43.060
How tall are you?

14:43.898 --> 14:46.800
- 5'10".
- You wanna wrestle?

14:47.995 --> 14:49.783
Okay, let's go.

14:50.235 --> 14:53.432
Hey, you guys should come
to the club I'm spinning at tonight.

14:53.532 --> 14:55.953
I have a class in the morning.

14:56.059 --> 14:59.834
I can put you two on the list, plus one
so you can bring your boyfriend.

14:59.995 --> 15:01.621
I don't have a boyfriend.

15:03.290 --> 15:07.088
All right, cool.
So just the two of you then.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.881
- We'll see.
- Cool.

15:18.299 --> 15:19.761
Zoe.

15:20.475 --> 15:22.931
5'11" actually, with shoes.

15:36.572 --> 15:38.264
Second line.

15:46.140 --> 15:47.798
Second line.

15:51.004 --> 15:52.565
Line one.

15:58.268 --> 16:00.440
What is that?

16:02.205 --> 16:04.212
It felt more natural that way.

16:04.541 --> 16:07.640
You're not here to be natural.
You're here to learn ballet.

16:12.254 --> 16:13.912
Second line.

16:16.798 --> 16:19.187
Must be all that fine Chicago training.

16:30.974 --> 16:34.105
Wow. Well, look at this place, momma.

16:34.206 --> 16:36.824
Only a few minutes in New York
and already we're on the list

16:36.926 --> 16:38.780
at the hottest spot in town.

16:38.878 --> 16:42.491
- Okay. Momma?
- Okay, I'm exploring my range.

16:43.423 --> 16:45.627
- "Momma" is not in my range?
- No.

16:46.014 --> 16:47.541
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:47.775 --> 16:49.302
- Hi.
- Let's go.

16:49.535 --> 16:51.575
Okay, remember,
we can't stay up too late.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.238
I know, I know. Hey, chill, momma.

16:53.342 --> 16:56.375
- Jeez! Ballerinas.
- I don't really... None of...

16:56.479 --> 16:58.748
- I don't really dance.
- Hey.

16:58.910 --> 17:01.147
- I knew you'd come.
- Hi.

17:01.503 --> 17:04.186
- Who's this?
- Hello to you, too.

17:04.287 --> 17:06.557
- Sara, Candy.
- Nice to meet you.

17:07.103 --> 17:09.656
- I'm sure it is.
- Okay...

17:09.759 --> 17:11.701
Hey, don't mind her.
She's like that with everybody.

17:11.807 --> 17:12.920
Come on.

17:13.055 --> 17:14.964
What about my drink?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.723
- Where are we going?
- To the pit.

17:17.823 --> 17:18.871
Pit?

17:35.808 --> 17:39.420
Wow! This is a whole other level.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.197
Yeah, I used to have to sneak out

17:42.304 --> 17:45.916
and take the 9 train up to
the South Bronx to see stuff like this.

17:47.521 --> 17:49.527
It's funny, 'cause most of these kids,

17:49.632 --> 17:52.447
they don't even realize
that there's a history there,

17:52.705 --> 17:54.265
a shadow behind every move.

17:54.369 --> 17:57.686
Every step they make
is into a footprint bigger than their own.

18:01.504 --> 18:02.966
Kind of like ballet.

18:05.696 --> 18:07.071
Professor!

18:08.576 --> 18:11.359
I'm paying you to spin,
not stand still, man.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.008
This is Mixx,
he's the father of this party.

18:15.105 --> 18:18.139
- And who is this pretty distraction?
- This is Sara.

18:18.689 --> 18:21.755
- She's one of my students.
- Should have stayed in school.

18:22.338 --> 18:24.279
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

18:24.386 --> 18:26.174
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:26.913 --> 18:29.215
- That's my girl, Candy.
- Yeah, we've met.

18:29.314 --> 18:31.169
It don't get much flyer than Candy.

18:31.266 --> 18:32.346
Anything she do, you can bet,

18:32.450 --> 18:35.101
next week,
see 100 kids doing the same thing.

18:35.202 --> 18:37.307
- Or at least trying.
- Know what I'm saying, right?

18:37.410 --> 18:39.745
Yo, honor and pleasure to meet you,
little lady.

18:39.843 --> 18:41.730
I have to go be the man.
Y'all enjoy the party.

18:41.826 --> 18:44.575
You, over here wasting my money,
go do your thing tonight, man.

18:44.674 --> 18:46.584
- All right, man.
- All right, man.

18:47.011 --> 18:49.694
- I got to go spin. Straight?
- Yeah.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.842
- You sure?
- Yeah.

18:50.947 --> 18:53.849
- You're not scared?
- You ever audition for Juilliard?

18:55.651 --> 19:00.059
We gonna heat it up for you.
That's in case you decide to go in.

19:16.707 --> 19:19.009
<i>Yo, what's going on?
This is your boy, Daddy Mix.</i>

19:19.108 --> 19:21.497
<i>Hey, I'm about to bring my man
out on the ones and twos right now.</i>

19:21.604 --> 19:23.011
<i>But we gonna have to bring him out
the right way.</i>

19:23.107 --> 19:24.351
<i>I'm gonna need y'all to repeat after me.</i>

19:24.452 --> 19:26.394
<i>We gonna do it like this. Yo! Say,</i>

19:26.499 --> 19:28.769
<i>Hey, one, two, check it out</i>

19:28.868 --> 19:30.972
<i>Hey, one, two, check it out</i>

19:31.076 --> 19:33.182
<i>Hey, one, two, check it out</i>

19:33.284 --> 19:36.001
<i>Hey, one, two, check it out</i>

19:36.100 --> 19:37.955
<i>Do your thing, boy</i>

19:38.052 --> 19:40.703
<i>Yo, this is your boy, Mike L-E-S.</i>

19:40.804 --> 19:43.771
<i>Yo, big show tonight.
Time for wylin' out Chi-town style.</i>

19:43.876 --> 19:45.818
<i>Y'all know what to do.</i>

20:13.093 --> 20:14.783
So what are you waiting for?

20:25.350 --> 20:26.943
Come on, girl!

20:37.158 --> 20:38.914
What's up? Can you take it?

21:22.151 --> 21:23.264
Yeah.

21:38.344 --> 21:39.751
She's really good!

22:24.265 --> 22:25.727
Oh, my God!

22:59.403 --> 23:02.272
- What was that?
- Dude, that was awesome!

23:02.379 --> 23:03.753
What?

23:06.379 --> 23:09.281
- That's not water.
- I know. It's vodka.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.846
Hey, Sara.
Hey, yo, I'm sorry I couldn't get back.

23:31.947 --> 23:35.592
This other kid was supposed to spin,
but he didn't show. But, yo...

23:35.724 --> 23:37.698
I saw you killing them in the pit all night.

23:37.803 --> 23:40.738
- What? You were amazing.
- Thank you.

23:40.843 --> 23:42.851
You weren't too bad yourself.

23:43.564 --> 23:47.394
We were gonna go get some breakfast
if you wanted to...

23:47.500 --> 23:50.599
I can't. I've got class in, like,
three-and-a-half hours.

23:57.164 --> 23:59.530
Looks like Franz found a friend.

24:01.453 --> 24:02.730
Oh...

24:03.788 --> 24:07.236
I should probably get my roommate
home before she hurts somebody.

24:13.388 --> 24:14.632
Okay, see you.

24:19.085 --> 24:21.224
Okay, let's go.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.308
- Okay.
- See ya.

25:16.592 --> 25:17.671
No...

25:17.774 --> 25:19.880
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What?

25:28.975 --> 25:30.665
Allegro.

25:30.767 --> 25:32.228
Please wake up.

25:32.623 --> 25:34.565
You're thinking too much.

25:35.599 --> 25:37.290
It's not your job.

25:37.647 --> 25:41.095
Thought was put into these steps
hundreds of years ago.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.063
It's simply your duty to execute it
as it was handed down.

25:46.159 --> 25:47.588
Faster.

25:51.311 --> 25:52.521
Stop.

25:53.327 --> 25:54.734
What are you doing?

25:55.376 --> 25:57.961
- I'm sorry, Miss Delacroix.
- You what?

26:00.145 --> 26:01.639
I'm sorry.

26:04.785 --> 26:06.279
Look at me.

26:09.456 --> 26:10.950
You smell of alcohol.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.469
Did you need a drink
to prepare for class?

26:15.408 --> 26:18.190
- No.
- Then why do you smell like a tavern?

26:19.121 --> 26:21.008
I went out with some friends.

26:21.424 --> 26:22.951
Oh, did you now?

26:23.248 --> 26:25.158
Where did your friends take you?

26:26.928 --> 26:29.514
- To a club.
- To a club?

26:30.480 --> 26:32.074
Was it a ballet club?

26:34.994 --> 26:36.203
No.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.840
Do you know
what's behind the third line?

26:45.138 --> 26:47.920
Nothing.
There's nothing behind the third line.

26:49.137 --> 26:52.203
That nothing's a... It's a magical place
where you can eat what you want,

26:52.306 --> 26:55.339
and you can sleep in
and have ice cream

26:55.794 --> 26:57.681
and cheeseburgers and candy and...

26:57.778 --> 27:00.647
And you can...
And you can wear what you want.

27:00.754 --> 27:03.721
And you can drink whenever you like,
and then you can come in here,

27:03.825 --> 27:07.372
and you can pretend that there are
no consequences to your actions.

27:07.474 --> 27:11.152
But that nothing
does not reside within these walls.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.227
Third line.

27:20.850 --> 27:21.995
Bella.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.275
<i>"I've often been asked
what is the key to my success.</i>

27:56.852 --> 27:59.241
<i>"The answer is always the same.</i>

27:59.955 --> 28:04.178
<i>"I have never allowed anyone
to stand in the way of my heart."</i>

28:06.932 --> 28:08.339
What did I do?

28:08.436 --> 28:10.324
- I don't know. What did you do?
- I don't know.

28:10.419 --> 28:13.322
You just been jetting out of here
every day like you stole something.

28:13.428 --> 28:14.606
See you.

28:14.868 --> 28:17.935
I need to spend more time practicing,
get focused.

28:18.452 --> 28:19.794
Well, I know this place
around the corner.

28:19.893 --> 28:21.648
Best cannolis on the Upper West Side.
Maybe we could...

28:21.748 --> 28:23.242
I really don't have time to go anywhere.

28:23.348 --> 28:25.421
So I got these friends
that own a art gallery downtown,

28:25.524 --> 28:27.019
and they're doing this big show
on street art.

28:27.125 --> 28:29.460
Graffiti, tag and all the way
from the beginning till now.

28:29.558 --> 28:32.240
They asked this guy Nigel,
who's a video director,

28:32.341 --> 28:33.934
real creative cat, to pull together

28:34.037 --> 28:36.656
a video installation/performance piece
for the exhibit.

28:36.757 --> 28:38.186
And he asked me to handle the music,

28:38.294 --> 28:41.011
and I was hoping that maybe
you could help me out.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.568
- How?
- Choreograph a dance piece.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.714
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.054
Why me?

28:47.157 --> 28:51.118
What you did back at the club, that was
some of the illest stuff I've ever seen.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.542
Look, I'd love to help you out.

28:54.646 --> 28:57.428
But I'm doing everything I can
just to keep my head above water...

28:57.526 --> 28:59.697
- Sara.
...in my classes, okay?

29:01.141 --> 29:03.149
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

29:04.502 --> 29:06.324
- What's this?
- Just some beats I been working on.

29:06.422 --> 29:07.731
It's kind of off the bubble.

29:07.830 --> 29:11.342
None of that Hot 97 rah-rah.
You know what I'm saying?

29:11.639 --> 29:13.133
Just listen to it.

29:22.582 --> 29:24.175
Was that you humming just now?

29:24.279 --> 29:26.799
It's beatboxing. It's humming 2.0.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.587
- It's odd.
- It's part of my culture.

29:29.687 --> 29:32.437
That's not what I meant. What I meant,

29:33.687 --> 29:35.410
that most people
wouldn't be able to revisit

29:35.510 --> 29:37.201
the site of their greatest failure

29:37.303 --> 29:38.732
with so much ease.

29:40.150 --> 29:44.013
What is it about you that
makes you so comfortable with defeat?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.358
You seem pretty relaxed.

29:46.456 --> 29:48.147
What was the last dancer
you got into ABT?

29:48.247 --> 29:49.774
San Francisco? Joffrey?

29:51.831 --> 29:53.970
- Losing your touch, huh?
- No.

29:54.423 --> 29:56.431
I'm just maintaining my standards.

30:13.559 --> 30:14.836
Morning, Bella.

30:24.601 --> 30:26.705
I can't even get out of the third line.

30:26.809 --> 30:28.696
She's making an example of you.

30:29.145 --> 30:30.160
Lucky me.

30:30.265 --> 30:32.982
I'm, like, this close from Monique
presenting me as her protégé.

30:34.361 --> 30:35.572
Oh, my God.

30:36.249 --> 30:38.288
I've never been so sore in my life.

30:39.064 --> 30:40.275
Get used to it.

30:40.569 --> 30:43.504
I don't think I've slept
more than four hours since I got here.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.715
If there's one thing in life
I could get rid of, it'd be sleep.

30:45.818 --> 30:47.443
It's such a waste of time.

30:47.705 --> 30:49.363
Such a waste.

30:55.898 --> 30:57.173
I don't do drugs.

30:57.817 --> 30:59.475
It's not heroin, Sara.

31:01.754 --> 31:02.930
Just remember,

31:03.706 --> 31:06.488
Xenical is your pal
when you want to keep the weight off.

31:06.586 --> 31:09.237
Percocet's best for the knees
that want to fall off.

31:09.945 --> 31:13.939
And Ambien is your friend
when you just need to doze off.

31:21.051 --> 31:23.473
You want to get out of the third line,
don't you?

31:28.602 --> 31:30.325
I don't want to be
the goddamn quirky brunette.

31:30.426 --> 31:32.565
- What?
- Every play I've ever been in,

31:32.730 --> 31:36.308
I wind up playing this witty-yet-lovable,
slightly insane girl

31:36.412 --> 31:38.550
with the plaid skirt and weird laugh.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.111
Yeah, you're right.
That doesn't sound like you at all.

31:41.211 --> 31:42.521
So we're doing this play,

31:42.619 --> 31:46.002
and the lead character is this quirky,
well, homicidal brunette type,

31:46.107 --> 31:47.765
and of course
they want me to read for it.

31:47.867 --> 31:50.039
- Wow, the lead. That's great.
- No, that's not great.

31:50.139 --> 31:54.362
Jeez, are you even listening to me?
If I do this now, it will never stop.

31:54.619 --> 31:58.001
That'll be it for me. I'll always be
the goddamn quirky brunette.

31:58.107 --> 32:00.954
- Then don't do it.
- No. I can't not do it.

32:01.052 --> 32:03.702
This could be my big break.
I could get an agent.

32:04.476 --> 32:06.865
So why don't you just read
for another part?

32:42.077 --> 32:43.571
I'm not gonna quit

32:44.348 --> 32:45.909
no matter how hard you push me,

32:46.013 --> 32:49.242
or how much you single me out
as an example of what not to do.

32:49.374 --> 32:51.032
I worked too hard to get here.

32:51.133 --> 32:54.264
And I am prepared
to do whatever it takes to be the best.

32:55.230 --> 32:58.230
You're gonna have to pack my bags
if you want me gone.

33:01.117 --> 33:03.736
- Are you done, Sara?
- Yes.

33:21.854 --> 33:23.381
- So...
- Jesus!

33:23.485 --> 33:24.947
Sure you don't want to get a cannoli?

33:25.053 --> 33:26.615
I'm doing some research.

33:28.510 --> 33:30.332
Trying to get inside
the master's head, huh?

33:30.430 --> 33:32.252
But I hear it's a scary place.

33:32.830 --> 33:35.864
You seem to know a lot
about this school for a guest lecturer.

33:35.966 --> 33:38.137
Well, that's 'cause I used to go here.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.438
- What?
- You heard me.

33:41.791 --> 33:42.968
You went here?

33:43.167 --> 33:46.265
Hey, I may not look like it,
but I'm a pretty cultured cat.

33:46.526 --> 33:49.975
- What were you here for?
- Piano. Composition actually.

33:51.999 --> 33:54.171
- You must've been good.
- Damn straight.

33:54.431 --> 33:56.471
- So I dropped out.
- What?

33:57.855 --> 33:59.546
Why would you give this up?

34:00.863 --> 34:01.846
It just wasn't for me.

34:01.951 --> 34:04.602
So did you listen
to those tracks I gave you?

34:04.704 --> 34:06.078
Look, you're gonna have
to get somebody else.

34:06.176 --> 34:09.656
- I don't want anybody else. I want you.
- You don't even know me.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.800
I know what I saw at the club that night.

34:11.904 --> 34:13.726
- Get Candy to choreograph it.
- Forget Candy.

34:13.822 --> 34:16.507
Nigel said it'll take one day.
We can shoot this weekend.

34:16.608 --> 34:18.233
- This weekend?
- It'll be fun.

34:18.335 --> 34:19.896
I'm not here for fun.

34:21.728 --> 34:23.801
<i>This Sara Johnson,
what do we know about her?</i>

34:23.904 --> 34:26.043
Well, she studied
at a few small princess academies

34:26.143 --> 34:28.031
and then last year with Uri Pell.

34:28.384 --> 34:31.101
Her father's a musician.
I've never heard of him, though.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.818
- And her mother?
- She died last year.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.302
Actually, around the same time
she first auditioned for Juilliard.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.295
I read her file. I'm her mentor.

34:41.985 --> 34:43.414
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

34:48.928 --> 34:50.007
Here you go.

34:50.753 --> 34:52.378
Monique wants to see you.

34:54.081 --> 34:57.179
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah. I'm just a little tired.

35:06.014 --> 35:08.567
- Marcus, are you okay?
- I just had my review.

35:09.599 --> 35:10.808
She dropped me.

35:11.582 --> 35:14.680
She made me work my ass off.
How can I just go home?

35:16.382 --> 35:17.559
I'm sorry.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.713
Close the door.

35:33.247 --> 35:34.295
Come.

35:39.039 --> 35:41.723
I've observed some things
that are distressing me.

35:41.951 --> 35:45.180
You need to work on your turnout.
Your arms are overly expressive.

35:45.279 --> 35:46.654
You keep turning...

35:46.943 --> 35:47.926
Sara?

35:48.031 --> 35:50.366
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- Oh, my God.

35:57.056 --> 35:59.739
Kleenex. Kleenex. Kleenex.

36:04.383 --> 36:05.660
Here you go.

36:08.639 --> 36:11.935
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's all right. Are you all right now?

36:12.832 --> 36:14.807
- Can I take it?
- Yes.

36:16.225 --> 36:17.271
Oh, God.

36:21.216 --> 36:22.623
You're taking pills.

36:28.704 --> 36:30.493
I've never taken them before.

36:31.393 --> 36:34.142
I swear. Just, my body hurts.

36:34.369 --> 36:36.955
I can't sleep, can't eat.

36:38.401 --> 36:40.375
I just... I don't know what to do,

36:41.185 --> 36:43.421
and this is the first time it happened.

36:49.602 --> 36:50.812
It's just hard.

36:54.082 --> 36:57.693
Sara, it's supposed to be hard.
It wouldn't be worth it if it weren't.

37:06.753 --> 37:08.182
Now we have to focus

37:09.986 --> 37:12.124
on strengthening your ankles.

37:13.666 --> 37:14.975
I'm not being cut?

37:16.002 --> 37:17.628
Why would you think that?

38:29.188 --> 38:30.301
Very good.

38:31.301 --> 38:33.667
Please clear the studio
for the next class.

38:40.389 --> 38:42.691
- How did I do?
- You were brilliant.

38:43.141 --> 38:44.767
But I'm not your frigging cheerleader,
so in the future,

38:44.869 --> 38:46.723
if you're curious about
your performance, look in the mirror.

38:46.821 --> 38:48.644
That's what they're there for.

39:10.982 --> 39:13.633
I was pretty surprised you found time
to fit me and my cannoli in.

39:13.734 --> 39:16.603
Well, it kind of threw me there.
That whole Juilliard drop-out thing.

39:16.710 --> 39:20.092
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?
- Dunno. It never came up.

39:20.454 --> 39:22.309
Guess I was being a little harsh.

39:22.406 --> 39:25.853
You have no idea how intimidating
Monique Delacroix can be.

39:27.014 --> 39:30.047
- Listen, Sara, about that...
- No. It wasn't you. I'm sorry.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.881
I just didn't realize how intense
Juilliard would really be, you know?

39:35.527 --> 39:37.120
It's so important to me.

39:38.503 --> 39:39.518
Why?

39:40.487 --> 39:41.534
Since I was little,

39:41.639 --> 39:45.251
my mom and I always dreamed about
me becoming a famous ballerina.

39:46.247 --> 39:47.621
The day of my

39:48.263 --> 39:51.362
first audition for Juilliard,
she really wanted to be there.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.564
I really wanted her to be there.

39:54.855 --> 39:56.447
It was my turn to dance.

39:57.223 --> 39:59.230
So I looked around,

40:00.936 --> 40:02.627
and I knew something was wrong.

40:03.399 --> 40:07.229
I was right. She died in a car accident
trying to get to my audition.

40:12.808 --> 40:13.855
Here.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.875
- What about you?
- Me?

40:20.424 --> 40:21.951
I was raised by wolves.

40:23.816 --> 40:26.467
And are you
and your wolf parents close?

40:27.400 --> 40:31.524
My mom and dad split when I was three.
I lived with my grandfather till he died,

40:31.913 --> 40:33.407
and then I went to school.

40:34.568 --> 40:36.837
Now I'm on my own, struggling, striving.

40:38.376 --> 40:39.653
Do you miss him?

40:40.840 --> 40:42.302
Yeah. He was wild.

40:42.824 --> 40:46.208
Mad old-school but a real cool cat.
He bought me my first record.

40:46.313 --> 40:49.629
Speaking of which,
did you listen to that CD I gave you?

40:50.825 --> 40:52.287
- I did.
- Really?

40:53.129 --> 40:55.463
It's hot. You got promise.

40:57.385 --> 41:01.379
Okay. So, what's it gonna take
for Sara Johnson to help me out?

41:05.353 --> 41:08.833
- You are not gonna make me beg.
- Yes. Yes, I am.

41:10.249 --> 41:13.599
Sara, please help me do this.

41:16.778 --> 41:18.403
- It's just one day, right?
- Just one day.

41:18.506 --> 41:22.467
And there will absolutely be no fun
involved at all, guaranteed.

41:28.778 --> 41:30.022
I'll think about it.

41:31.178 --> 41:32.259
You'll think... What?

41:32.362 --> 41:34.566
What're you talking about,
you'll think about it?

41:44.779 --> 41:48.576
Class, I'm sure you're all waiting
to hear about the fall production.

41:48.682 --> 41:51.781
<i>This year, we'll be dancing
the classic romance, Giselle.</i>

41:52.459 --> 41:54.793
I recommend
that you all study it closely.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.791
<i>Giselle is possibly
one of the greatest works in the canon.</i>

41:58.955 --> 42:01.770
<i>Giselle requires
uncommon technical virtuosity.</i>

42:02.027 --> 42:04.099
Its beauty is uncompromising.

42:04.236 --> 42:07.651
And I shall be equally uncompromising
in my choices.

42:07.755 --> 42:11.072
All the roles are open. Class dismissed.

42:18.700 --> 42:22.409
What a bitch! She's a jealous bitch.

42:22.508 --> 42:25.606
Katrina is, like, this close to being
presented as Monique's protégé.

42:25.708 --> 42:27.683
She has no reason to be jealous.

42:27.789 --> 42:29.163
Yeah, everyone's paranoid,

42:29.260 --> 42:30.754
'cause they know
if they make one mistake,

42:30.860 --> 42:32.748
or somebody better comes along,
they're out.

42:32.843 --> 42:35.397
<i>This isn't a school. It's Survivor.</i>

42:36.236 --> 42:39.531
Where you guys going? I thought
you were coming with me to Miles'.

42:39.628 --> 42:40.577
Oh, we'll be back later.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.855
Franz has to go down to Canal Street
for a defibrillator.

42:42.956 --> 42:46.087
- Modulator.
- Modulator. And I really need a new hat.

42:46.956 --> 42:47.971
Ciao.

43:14.414 --> 43:16.104
That was beautiful.

43:16.909 --> 43:18.764
Yeah, my man Satie's no joke.

43:19.181 --> 43:22.498
This place is amazing.
Not exactly struggling.

43:22.606 --> 43:26.184
Yeah, I consider it a consolation prize
from parents who don't speak.

43:27.502 --> 43:29.509
Everybody should be here a little later.

43:29.614 --> 43:32.265
So I figure we should get right
before they start showing up, yeah?

43:32.365 --> 43:35.213
Look, those beats you gave me?

43:35.502 --> 43:37.673
They're good. I like them.

43:38.511 --> 43:41.642
- But they're abstract.
- What do you mean, abstract?

43:42.382 --> 43:44.007
They're not really danceable.

43:44.719 --> 43:45.766
Not danceable? What are you...

43:45.871 --> 43:48.074
You sound like them bubblehead cats
down at the club.

43:48.175 --> 43:50.030
I'm trying to push it.
That's why I wanted to work with you.

43:50.127 --> 43:53.323
You want people to like it,
and you want me to dance to it, right?

43:53.423 --> 43:56.140
- You can't dance to that?
- I can dance to anything.

43:56.687 --> 43:57.832
But not that?

43:59.502 --> 44:00.517
Wow.

44:01.616 --> 44:05.031
All right. All right. So, cool. Tell me
what you want, and I'll work with you.

44:05.135 --> 44:07.557
- Hey, this was your idea.
- No, it's cool.

44:08.559 --> 44:10.763
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

44:11.599 --> 44:14.501
Okay. Track four.
Can you make it faster?

45:09.970 --> 45:12.074
Bloody long trek from that train.

45:12.560 --> 45:15.016
This is Nigel,
the director I was telling you about.

45:15.121 --> 45:18.089
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Miles tells me you're a genius.

45:18.193 --> 45:20.910
Are you sure
he wasn't talking about himself?

45:21.009 --> 45:22.766
All right, boys. Let's go.

45:25.361 --> 45:27.598
- What's up, man?
- 50 bucks in Chinatown, baby.

45:27.698 --> 45:29.040
50 bucks.

45:29.841 --> 45:32.656
So Nigel thinks we have something hot.

45:33.202 --> 45:35.722
There's no way I could've done that
without you.

45:35.826 --> 45:38.160
- It was fun. You were right.
- I know.

45:38.258 --> 45:40.014
I wish I had more time
to do stuff like that.

45:40.113 --> 45:42.699
What?
You have all the time in the world.

45:43.026 --> 45:45.579
Not if I'm going to be
a prima ballerina by 21.

45:45.746 --> 45:47.918
That's really what you want to do, huh?

45:48.019 --> 45:49.426
That's the plan.

45:50.451 --> 45:52.360
Damn. All right.

45:52.530 --> 45:54.569
I was really hoping that, I don't know...

45:55.378 --> 45:56.905
me and you could,

45:58.483 --> 45:59.661
maybe...

46:00.755 --> 46:02.162
We could what?

46:06.803 --> 46:08.526
Get a cannoli or something?

46:09.875 --> 46:12.625
- A cannoli?
- Yeah, a cannoli.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.402
- I should get some rest.
- Yeah.

46:24.691 --> 46:27.147
<i>I got my Giselle audition in the morning.</i>

46:27.251 --> 46:28.495
Yeah, definitely.

46:29.204 --> 46:30.578
Good night.

46:48.084 --> 46:50.506
- What part are you auditioning for?
- Giselle.

46:52.212 --> 46:53.706
Whenever you're ready.

47:20.757 --> 47:22.895
Yo, Nigel showed me the edits.

47:23.318 --> 47:25.805
It is coconuts. You rocked it, girl.

47:26.390 --> 47:28.299
I can't wait to see it.

47:30.293 --> 47:32.628
- You look beat.
- I am beat.

47:32.725 --> 47:36.304
Well, give up them feet. It's time for
Dr. Miles' famous foot massage.

47:36.406 --> 47:38.740
- No, they're awful.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

47:38.838 --> 47:40.911
My man Stef got feet
that look like monkey hands,

47:41.014 --> 47:43.381
so yours can't be that much worse.
Come on.

47:43.798 --> 47:46.066
- Come on.
- Okay.

47:46.390 --> 47:48.114
- Oh, my...
- I told you.

47:48.214 --> 47:49.709
Just playing.

47:54.614 --> 47:55.923
Feels good, right?

48:00.791 --> 48:02.613
So why you dancing ballet?

48:03.094 --> 48:04.338
What do you mean?

48:04.535 --> 48:09.269
I don't know. It's just so rigid.
You could do so much more.

48:11.191 --> 48:14.867
Oh, right.
I have the soul of a trombone player.

48:15.222 --> 48:16.204
Yes.

48:19.318 --> 48:22.188
I used to dream
about being this classical composer.

48:22.294 --> 48:24.880
I mean, pounding out notes
on the piano, hour after hour.

48:24.983 --> 48:26.706
I read every book
written on music theory.

48:26.807 --> 48:29.229
I wanted to write a symphony
by the time I turned 18.

48:29.335 --> 48:30.742
What happened?

48:30.935 --> 48:34.612
Wrote the sketches for my symphony.
Got it into Juilliard and got accepted.

48:37.016 --> 48:38.642
But you ended up quitting.

48:40.728 --> 48:41.743
Why?

48:46.200 --> 48:47.629
Dreams change.

48:51.768 --> 48:53.394
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

48:53.496 --> 48:55.798
- I got the part in the play.
- The quirky brunette?

48:55.896 --> 48:59.158
- No, the dumb blonde.
- Oh, my God. That's great!

49:02.809 --> 49:05.558
God, gross.
You're touching her ballerina feet.

49:06.233 --> 49:07.924
Okay, you know what?
If you guys are going to do that,

49:08.024 --> 49:09.966
one, wear gloves.

49:10.233 --> 49:11.793
And two, just...

49:16.953 --> 49:19.409
<i>How do you know when you're
performing a movement perfectly?</i>

49:19.513 --> 49:22.415
You feel perfect. You are the
movement.

49:23.065 --> 49:26.677
Everything is working within you
and through you.

49:28.474 --> 49:30.644
All effort falls away.

49:32.154 --> 49:34.041
You disappear into the dance.

49:35.226 --> 49:38.487
And all that's left
is the purity of the spirit

49:39.321 --> 49:40.434
and emotion.

49:44.249 --> 49:45.330
Bella.

49:46.138 --> 49:48.440
Sara, first line.

49:51.323 --> 49:53.559
Katrina, could you get the bars please?

49:54.746 --> 49:56.273
Well, I'd love Giselle.

49:56.474 --> 49:58.614
I'll be anything
as long as it isn't a peasant.

49:58.714 --> 49:59.958
I can't stand being a peasant.

50:00.059 --> 50:02.001
But I'd be happy
with the Queen of the Wilis.

50:02.106 --> 50:04.114
- Have you ever been a peasant?
- No.

50:04.218 --> 50:06.706
Well, it's all these
little folksy steps and this...

50:08.955 --> 50:11.411
I just can't bear it again.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.301
- Oh, my God.
- There it is.

50:18.106 --> 50:20.627
Katrina got Giselle.
Well, no surprise there.

50:21.051 --> 50:23.571
But you got Queen of the Wilis.

50:24.412 --> 50:26.800
Looks like I'm going to be doing this
for the next six weeks.

50:26.907 --> 50:28.882
- Okay, see you.
- Oh, where are you going?

50:28.987 --> 50:30.678
I gotta get to my opening.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.263
- In a minute. Just a minute.
- Come on.

50:42.683 --> 50:43.764
In a minute.

50:49.277 --> 50:51.960
- Look at you.
- What do you think?

50:52.764 --> 50:54.969
I like it. It's hip.

50:55.068 --> 50:58.363
- There's a little hop in there, too.
- They're about to start again.

50:58.460 --> 51:00.021
Come on. Let's go.

51:00.124 --> 51:01.531
Can't wait to see your new dance piece.

51:01.628 --> 51:03.571
I need to get some fresh air,
so you guys go ahead.

51:03.677 --> 51:04.658
- Okay.
- I'll see you inside.

51:04.764 --> 51:05.942
Be in there.

51:18.877 --> 51:22.172
You're one of Monique's girls.
Sara, isn't it?

51:22.269 --> 51:23.578
Yes, that's right.

51:23.677 --> 51:26.263
Simone Eldaire. I head
the Modern Department at Juilliard.

51:26.365 --> 51:28.787
I know who you are.
It's an honor to meet you.

51:28.893 --> 51:31.413
I saw your piece. You were quite good.

51:32.093 --> 51:35.093
- Who choreographed it?
- I did.

51:37.054 --> 51:38.330
Congratulations.

51:39.581 --> 51:40.661
Thank you.

51:40.829 --> 51:42.739
You've put quite a spell on Monique.

51:42.846 --> 51:45.398
Whenever I see her,
she just goes on about you.

51:45.662 --> 51:46.807
Really?

51:49.533 --> 51:50.962
Our secret.

51:51.486 --> 51:53.395
I'm down to just one a day.

51:53.501 --> 51:56.316
Oh, the things we dancers do
to our bodies.

51:57.822 --> 52:01.367
Ms. Eldaire, if it's okay,
can we just keep this between us?

52:01.471 --> 52:03.543
- I'm really not supposed to...
- Deal.

52:09.311 --> 52:12.028
Stop by my office
if you ever want to just talk

52:12.127 --> 52:14.996
about dance, boys, whatever.

52:15.103 --> 52:17.820
I know Monique can be a bit severe.

52:18.750 --> 52:20.060
Thank you. I will.

52:21.279 --> 52:22.523
It was a pleasure meeting you, Sara.

52:22.623 --> 52:24.990
I look forward to seeing
more of your work.

52:31.135 --> 52:32.183
Yes.

52:37.599 --> 52:41.178
What? Oh, my God!

52:41.280 --> 52:42.806
Are you kidding me?

53:23.169 --> 53:25.951
<i>The Vibe is at our party.
Do you know what this means?</i>

53:26.049 --> 53:28.121
This means... This means exposure.

53:28.225 --> 53:30.113
This means I'm not gonna
have to spend 25 minutes

53:30.210 --> 53:33.919
explaining my music to people, they just
gonna hear it and they gonna feel it.

53:34.017 --> 53:37.247
- I'm so happy for you.
- By me, you mean us, right?

53:37.537 --> 53:41.498
Miles, this was supposed to be
a one-time deal. I've got school.

53:41.602 --> 53:43.227
Wow! Right.

53:43.426 --> 53:45.629
Hey, can't do it, can't do it, right?

53:47.586 --> 53:51.382
<i>Okay, I've got Giselle rehearsals
four times a week,</i>

53:51.489 --> 53:55.799
and if I drop Intro to Hip-Hop,
since I get private tutoring anyway,

53:56.290 --> 53:58.623
- I could do it.
- That would be dope.

54:15.138 --> 54:17.888
<i>The Vibe guys said
we could have all the time we need.</i>

54:20.354 --> 54:21.369
Wow.

54:21.986 --> 54:25.021
- What's all this?
- That is my entire life on tape.

54:25.954 --> 54:27.897
- How many are there?
- I lost count.

54:28.003 --> 54:29.792
Over 8,000 hours at least.

54:30.435 --> 54:31.384
How did you...

54:31.491 --> 54:33.826
I just always carry around
a tape recorder.

54:34.083 --> 54:36.571
Started when I was young.
I was just a kid.

54:37.219 --> 54:39.739
First sound I remember
was the sound of rings jingling

54:39.843 --> 54:42.745
on the shower-curtain rod
when my mom was giving me a bath.

54:42.852 --> 54:44.858
- You got a tape of that?
- No. I was four.

54:45.347 --> 54:46.524
Let me see.

54:47.012 --> 54:49.052
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

54:51.619 --> 54:52.732
Come on.

54:59.395 --> 55:00.639
Have a seat.

55:09.252 --> 55:12.219
- What are we...
- Just listen.

55:20.901 --> 55:22.177
What is that?

55:24.197 --> 55:28.736
New York City, East River.
February 27, 1989.

55:29.764 --> 55:33.888
After five weeks below freezing,
the ice finally breaking.

57:28.456 --> 57:29.765
Concentrate.

57:31.881 --> 57:33.255
- You're okay.
- Yeah, I'm all right.

57:33.352 --> 57:34.846
Watch your turnout.

57:36.553 --> 57:37.960
Straighten up the line.

57:42.569 --> 57:43.584
Oh.

57:43.785 --> 57:46.435
- Katrina.
- You okay?

57:46.538 --> 57:47.846
- Get away from me. I'm fine.
- You sure?

57:47.946 --> 57:49.058
- Fine.
- Let's get you up gently.

57:49.161 --> 57:50.110
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

57:50.217 --> 57:52.520
- Can you take her to the clinic, please?
- Sure.

57:52.617 --> 57:53.599
I'm fine.

57:55.370 --> 57:58.403
So, in line. Let's go on.

58:01.801 --> 58:04.223
Bella, and...

58:20.331 --> 58:22.567
- What?
- Wake up, man.

58:23.146 --> 58:25.567
<i>Seriously, you've been all
Barney & Friends</i>

58:25.675 --> 58:28.227
ever since what's-her-name
scrambled your brains.

58:28.330 --> 58:31.396
- Am not.
- You two are like Bonnie and Clyde,

58:31.787 --> 58:33.510
Pam and Tommy Lee,

58:34.122 --> 58:36.490
- Bert and Ernie.
- All right.

58:36.587 --> 58:38.474
- Lewis and Clark.
- What?

58:38.571 --> 58:41.605
- Britney and Justin.
- They broke up.

58:41.708 --> 58:43.976
Seriously, man, you are so hooked.

58:44.394 --> 58:47.428
<i>It's like watching Bassmasters
on late night cable.</i>

58:48.203 --> 58:50.789
"And for tackle today,
we're using an eight-pound test line

58:50.891 --> 58:52.963
"and a blonde ballerina as bait."

58:54.828 --> 58:56.551
- Get out of here, man.
- You're hooked.

58:56.651 --> 58:58.058
All right, whatever.

59:02.252 --> 59:04.520
- You're hooked.
- All right, Eraserhead.

59:06.155 --> 59:09.353
<i>Hooked
Hooked on</i>

59:09.452 --> 59:10.466
Oh, that sells.

59:10.572 --> 59:12.360
The doctor said it was just a sprain.

59:12.460 --> 59:15.144
The doctor told me
you have permanent ligament damage.

59:15.244 --> 59:16.771
But Miss Delacroix...

59:17.228 --> 59:19.498
I'm sorry, Katrina. You can't dance.

59:28.908 --> 59:30.402
So who gets Giselle?

59:36.653 --> 59:38.059
It's Sara, isn't it?

59:44.237 --> 59:48.131
She's making a fool of you.
Ask your son.

59:52.525 --> 59:54.630
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:00:02.317 --> 01:00:04.390
Yo, stop, stop. Hold up.

01:00:05.485 --> 01:00:08.835
We can't even hear the drums with all
these horns blaring all over the place!

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:10.665
Okay. You know what?
I'm really sick and tired of all your...

01:00:10.766 --> 01:00:12.905
Hey, why don't we just take a break?

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:17.613
I really don't know, man.
Who does she think she is?

01:00:21.934 --> 01:00:24.486
- What?
- You're amazing.

01:00:26.766 --> 01:00:28.010
So are you.

01:00:31.214 --> 01:00:33.549
There's something I need to talk to you
about, actually...

01:00:33.646 --> 01:00:36.102
Can we not take so many breaks
here today?

01:00:36.207 --> 01:00:37.734
Some of us have a life.

01:00:42.863 --> 01:00:43.943
What is it?

01:00:46.575 --> 01:00:47.687
It's nothing.

01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:51.755
All right, let's take it from the top.

01:00:51.855 --> 01:00:54.059
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:10.250
- You really did a job this time.
- This has nothing to do with you.

01:01:10.352 --> 01:01:12.654
You're right.
It has everything to do with her.

01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:14.693
Jesus, you don't care about her!

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.425
- You need her...
- She's gifted...

01:01:16.528 --> 01:01:18.667
...more than she needs you.
...the way you were.

01:01:18.768 --> 01:01:21.256
- But you threw yours away.
- Please.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.847
For what? So some kids
on the street could know your name.

01:01:23.953 --> 01:01:26.124
My dream changed. That's all.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:28.712
I think you're just ashamed of
where you come from.

01:01:28.816 --> 01:01:31.914
No. I'm ashamed that you can't accept
that my history is out there

01:01:32.016 --> 01:01:33.958
and not inside this
white marble mausoleum.

01:01:34.064 --> 01:01:35.952
- You sound like your father.
- Fancy that.

01:01:36.048 --> 01:01:38.120
You're angry at me, be angry at me.
But let her alone.

01:01:38.224 --> 01:01:39.271
I love her.

01:01:46.993 --> 01:01:48.008
Well, good.

01:01:49.393 --> 01:01:50.953
Let her live her dream.

01:01:51.761 --> 01:01:53.452
Don't destroy hers, as well.

01:02:07.345 --> 01:02:09.255
So just remember...

01:02:09.362 --> 01:02:10.671
- Sara.
- Yes?

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.639
Could you do me a favor and get me
my notes from the last design meeting?

01:02:13.745 --> 01:02:14.990
They're on my desk.

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:16.781
- Sure.
- Bye.

01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:52.014
Sara, I...

01:02:54.195 --> 01:02:58.930
I tried. I tried to tell you in the park,
in rehearsal...

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:03.853
I wanted to tell you.
I just didn't know how to step to you.

01:03:03.954 --> 01:03:05.449
I still don't.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.314
I was afraid I'd lose you.

01:03:07.411 --> 01:03:11.088
And I knew if it came down to me
or ballet, you'd choose ballet.

01:03:13.044 --> 01:03:14.931
- I love you...
- Don't say that.

01:03:18.036 --> 01:03:19.410
I believed you.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.198
I believed that someone who can
create music as beautifully as you

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.504
had to be telling the truth.

01:03:35.348 --> 01:03:39.145
You know what, Miles?
You're just another player.

01:03:46.645 --> 01:03:50.988
Yes, I know Miles was a total jerk, but...

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:55.283
You know, it's not like his mother
is a freaking saint, either.

01:03:56.085 --> 01:03:58.987
Okay.
This happens to me way too much.

01:03:59.093 --> 01:04:00.849
I'm a dumb blonde.

01:04:01.205 --> 01:04:02.481
I'm gonna go now.

01:04:06.933 --> 01:04:08.111
Sara.

01:04:08.981 --> 01:04:10.738
I want you to dance Giselle.

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:16.076
Everything all right?

01:04:17.525 --> 01:04:20.111
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Don't.

01:04:20.213 --> 01:04:23.661
Miles has never cared what effect
his actions have on other people.

01:04:23.766 --> 01:04:25.675
I've arranged for you to be moved
to a single room,

01:04:25.782 --> 01:04:27.440
so you can concentrate
on your preparation.

01:04:27.541 --> 01:04:30.444
- I don't need to.
- You need to rest. Get some sleep.

01:06:07.545 --> 01:06:10.479
Stop! Paul, just cut it out!

01:06:10.808 --> 01:06:12.467
You know you're not supposed
to stick out.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.577
You're supposed to blend.
You're a peasant.

01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:16.088
I'm coming up there.

01:06:17.241 --> 01:06:20.176
Sara. Hey, Miles doesn't know
I'm telling you this so...

01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:21.591
And he'd probably beat me up
if he found out,

01:06:21.689 --> 01:06:22.770
so, please don't tell him, okay?

01:06:22.874 --> 01:06:24.630
- Okay.
- He needs you.

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.071
The dancers won't listen to him,

01:06:26.169 --> 01:06:27.576
everything's falling apart.
Luckily, the guys...

01:06:27.674 --> 01:06:30.456
<i>I can't do anything, okay. I have Giselle.</i>

01:06:31.546 --> 01:06:32.690
I'm sorry.

01:06:33.913 --> 01:06:35.342
Okay, fine. That's cool.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.523
No. No, that's not cool.

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.001
Look, whatever happened
between you and Miles

01:06:39.098 --> 01:06:40.440
doesn't mean you can't help out.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.610
- You just don't want to.
- That's not fair.

01:06:42.714 --> 01:06:46.740
You're like mini-Monique. Jeté, jeté.

01:06:46.842 --> 01:06:50.258
- Zoe.
- I feel like I swallowed a bug.

01:06:54.715 --> 01:06:56.624
Sara, we can't come to your ballet.

01:06:56.731 --> 01:06:57.941
It's not 'cause of Zoe or anything,

01:06:58.043 --> 01:07:00.760
it's just we have dress rehearsal
that night and...

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:03.258
Well, we need all the rehearsal
we can get.

01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:05.300
Sorry.

01:07:06.331 --> 01:07:07.576
I understand.

01:07:15.547 --> 01:07:17.816
Sara, can you come up on stage,
please?

01:07:17.915 --> 01:07:18.929
Yes.

01:07:30.459 --> 01:07:32.019
Watch that rouge.

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:34.965
Ta-da!

01:07:36.444 --> 01:07:38.932
- Isn't it lovely?
- What's it for?

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:44.439
I'm having a dinner party
after the performance at my home.

01:07:45.404 --> 01:07:47.259
Absolutely everyone will be there,

01:07:47.356 --> 01:07:50.422
even the Chairman of the board
of American Ballet Theatre.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.144
Are you pleased?

01:07:59.004 --> 01:08:02.299
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

01:08:02.396 --> 01:08:05.430
You shouldn't be. You're my student.

01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:09.979
Now remember to watch
those extensions and think up.

01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:11.517
<i>Merde.</i>

01:08:24.988 --> 01:08:25.917
Excuse me, you can't go...

01:08:26.014 --> 01:08:29.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know her.
Thank you.

01:08:30.462 --> 01:08:32.917
- Wow, look at you.
- Hey, okay, no, no, no.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.923
Don't be nice yet, okay?

01:08:36.062 --> 01:08:38.429
There are two things. No.

01:08:42.942 --> 01:08:47.381
"I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

01:08:47.486 --> 01:08:48.763
"and that I love you so much.

01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:51.763
"Because no matter how stupid or crazy
I act, you've always been there for me.

01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:54.937
"And I'm sorry. Break a leg. Love, Zoe."

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.413
- It's okay.
- No, no, no, it's not okay,

01:08:59.519 --> 01:09:02.072
'cause I was such a bitch and...

01:09:02.175 --> 01:09:04.247
God, I am so proud of you, Sara.

01:09:04.446 --> 01:09:08.439
You did it. You know, you did
what you said you were going to do.

01:09:09.182 --> 01:09:12.314
- You're so rad.
- You're the rad one.

01:09:12.575 --> 01:09:15.390
- And so blonde.
- I know.

01:09:16.607 --> 01:09:19.127
I kind of like being a dumb blonde.

01:09:20.063 --> 01:09:22.201
You know I think Franz likes it, too.

01:09:22.303 --> 01:09:23.732
Men are so easy.

01:09:24.031 --> 01:09:26.933
<i>Fifteen minutes to places, please.
Fifteen minutes.</i>

01:09:27.519 --> 01:09:31.513
You have some twirling to do.
I'm gonna try and not whistle too loud.

01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:33.437
Wait. You said two things.

01:09:33.854 --> 01:09:35.283
Please don't hate me.

01:09:35.488 --> 01:09:38.358
I nearly killed Franz
when he asked me to do this.

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:42.042
It's from Miles.

01:13:59.816 --> 01:14:01.539
Wonderful!

01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:05.315
Giselle!

01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:40.584
Oh, great job.

01:14:40.682 --> 01:14:42.688
- It was great. It was wonderful.
- Good, good, good, thank you.

01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:57.959
Sara, there you are.

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.541
What on earth are you doing here?

01:15:02.313 --> 01:15:04.550
Everyone wants to congratulate you.

01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:10.951
What's the matter?

01:15:11.978 --> 01:15:13.353
Is something wrong?

01:15:16.714 --> 01:15:18.754
Oh, you must be exhausted.

01:15:19.402 --> 01:15:22.436
I can remember coming off stage
after a performance,

01:15:22.538 --> 01:15:24.360
barely able to walk.

01:15:25.866 --> 01:15:27.841
You leave everything on the stage.

01:15:29.419 --> 01:15:31.459
It's the best feeling in the world.

01:15:36.043 --> 01:15:39.753
- Did you ever wonder if...
- What?

01:15:41.387 --> 01:15:44.835
- If it was enough?
- Enough?

01:15:47.595 --> 01:15:51.589
Dear girl, once you get a taste for it,
it's never enough.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:54.763
In time, there are better sets,
lovelier costumes...

01:15:54.859 --> 01:15:55.906
No.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:01.442
Did you ever wonder
if this was all you'd ever do,

01:16:01.548 --> 01:16:03.042
all you'd ever be?

01:16:03.276 --> 01:16:05.797
Let's go. Everyone's waiting.

01:16:06.156 --> 01:16:09.801
Miss Delacroix, I don't think
I want to be just a ballerina.

01:16:09.901 --> 01:16:12.169
- It's just nerves.
- You're not listening.

01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:15.147
I can't give up everything for ballet.

01:16:15.244 --> 01:16:16.804
No one's asking you
to give up everything.

01:16:16.908 --> 01:16:18.184
But you will.

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:22.184
Maybe not on purpose,
maybe not all at once.

01:16:26.061 --> 01:16:29.802
Listen to me, Sara,
there are hundreds of thousands of girls

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.006
who would kill to be in your position.

01:16:32.109 --> 01:16:36.648
Your gift means nothing
without hard work, discipline

01:16:37.357 --> 01:16:40.292
and yes, sacrifice.

01:16:41.069 --> 01:16:43.655
You just have a child's idea
of happiness.

01:16:44.878 --> 01:16:47.878
And to be great you have to...
You have to let that go.

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:51.369
Why?

01:16:53.806 --> 01:16:55.628
I'll wait for you in the limo.

01:16:56.206 --> 01:16:58.539
I'm sorry. I can't go to your party.

01:17:17.167 --> 01:17:19.556
- You changed the song again!
- I had to.

01:17:19.662 --> 01:17:22.728
And I'm just supposed to redo
all the steps?

01:17:22.863 --> 01:17:24.618
This is your mess, you fix it.

01:17:24.718 --> 01:17:26.574
- Candy, please.
- No.

01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:29.769
You holler when you sort it all out,
Mr. Control Freak!

01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:32.489
You know the number,
unless you changed that, too.

01:17:35.439 --> 01:17:38.603
Miles, what are we gonna do now?

01:17:39.502 --> 01:17:42.023
I don't know, man.
Just give me a minute.

01:17:54.831 --> 01:17:58.694
- Sara, I...
- No, don't say anything.

01:18:00.847 --> 01:18:02.222
Please just listen.

01:18:03.056 --> 01:18:05.773
I danced the best
I've ever danced tonight.

01:18:06.736 --> 01:18:08.524
It was close to perfect.

01:18:09.679 --> 01:18:12.811
When I was done, I closed my eyes

01:18:12.911 --> 01:18:15.246
and I felt such peace.

01:18:16.368 --> 01:18:17.994
But when I opened them,

01:18:19.248 --> 01:18:22.958
everyone was standing and clapping.

01:18:25.488 --> 01:18:27.757
And I felt nothing.

01:18:31.216 --> 01:18:32.460
Just numb.

01:18:34.128 --> 01:18:37.740
And I thought to myself,
"That's an odd thing to feel.

01:18:38.064 --> 01:18:41.326
"I've worked my whole life
to get to this place,

01:18:41.872 --> 01:18:43.695
"and I feel nothing?"

01:18:45.681 --> 01:18:48.071
And then there you were.

01:18:49.905 --> 01:18:51.912
You popped into my head.

01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:54.925
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

01:18:56.337 --> 01:19:00.647
Your face, your smile,
and what you said that day in class.

01:19:01.681 --> 01:19:03.339
"I am here."

01:19:12.467 --> 01:19:16.973
And I realized this whole time, I've been
trying to perfect someone else's steps

01:19:17.106 --> 01:19:19.113
instead of finding my own.

01:19:20.786 --> 01:19:22.794
Well, I wanna be here, too.

01:19:24.146 --> 01:19:27.375
I wanna paint with ballerinas, b-boys

01:19:27.475 --> 01:19:29.579
in point shoes and high-tops.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:33.866
If my dream of dancing ballet

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.142
doesn't have enough room for all that,

01:19:36.243 --> 01:19:39.374
my friends,
and you with a cannoli once in a while,

01:19:41.267 --> 01:19:44.399
then I'm gonna have to find a dream
big enough that does.

01:19:46.163 --> 01:19:48.913
And all I was gonna say was,
"I'm sorry."

01:20:00.947 --> 01:20:03.947
So, looks like you're having
some trouble with your dancers.

01:20:04.052 --> 01:20:08.143
Yeah. We got 24 hours to get right,
and we looking kind of wrong right now.

01:20:08.244 --> 01:20:09.869
You know what I'm saying?

01:20:12.403 --> 01:20:13.778
You want some help?

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.919
You're not gonna make me beg,
are you?

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.932
Miles, please let me help you.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.613
All right.
