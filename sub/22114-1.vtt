( shouting )

01:54.084 --> 01:56.042
Woman:
Hey! Hey!

01:56.042 --> 01:59.042
Wha-- why didn't you
keep the door open?

01:59.042 --> 02:00.875
Oh, um...

02:00.875 --> 02:02.458
No-- no "after you"?

02:02.458 --> 02:07.667
I-- I-- I didn't really
get an "after you" vibe.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.750
Well-- well, why not?
I'm a woman, aren't I?

02:11.416 --> 02:13.000
- Yeah...
- Really?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.750
Well, I-- I just didn't
think you were the type

02:14.750 --> 02:16.917
who would want a guy
to hold the door
open for you.

02:16.917 --> 02:19.125
- What type am I?
- You know, you're a type.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.250
You have,
uh, short hair,

02:21.250 --> 02:24.792
you wear a tie,
you got a vest.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.500
It's, uh--
it's a look.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.084
So, you looked at me
and then let a door
shut on me.

02:30.084 --> 02:32.084
I thought you might not
want that, that's all.

02:32.084 --> 02:33.750
I was just trying
not to offend you,

02:33.750 --> 02:36.500
and yet I wound up
offending you, which is
quite ironic.

02:36.500 --> 02:40.375
It is ironic because
I would've enjoyed the door
being open for me.

02:40.375 --> 02:41.875
- And-- you know what I mean?
- Uh, well,

02:41.875 --> 02:44.000
also there was some
distance involved, too.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.542
- So I would say
type plus distance--
- Oh, you have an equation?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.959
- Yeah, type--
- You have an equation for the--

02:48.959 --> 02:50.250
Yes, it's
a mathematical equation.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.000
Type plus distance
equals no door hold.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.708
Where did you get
that equation from?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.250
Uh, I made it up.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.084
Well, you know,
what kind of vibe
I'm getting from you

02:58.084 --> 03:01.125
is that that's
a fucked up equation,
you know what I mean?

03:01.125 --> 03:04.625
But you can't argue
with the distance, though.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.458
That's a--

03:06.458 --> 03:07.959
that's a big factor.

03:11.375 --> 03:12.667
Larry: Huh?!

03:12.667 --> 03:15.917
"Fatwa! The Musical,"
written by Larry David.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.250
- Finally!
- Five years.

03:18.250 --> 03:20.084
- Five years.
- Yeah.

03:20.084 --> 03:23.750
You wrote a musical
about Salman Rushdie

03:23.750 --> 03:26.834
having his life ruined
'cause he got a fatwa,
a death threat,

03:26.834 --> 03:28.834
from the Ayatollah
Khomeini.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.542
I'm telling you,
there's a lot of
funny stuff in there.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.084
Who do you think about
playing Salman Rushdie

03:32.084 --> 03:33.416
and what about
the ayatollah?

03:33.416 --> 03:34.834
Salman Rushdie,
I don't know,

03:34.834 --> 03:37.667
but, uh,
the ayatollah,

03:37.667 --> 03:40.667
I'm actually flirting
with the notion of doing it.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.042
- You for the ayatollah?
- I don't know, I probably
won't do it.

03:43.042 --> 03:46.250
- It's like the odds are--
- The idea sucks, Lar.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.000
It's a stupid idea.
It's just a...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.750
- How are you helping?
- ...fatwa.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.333
Really?
Oh, like you're
a paragon of tastes.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.166
- Yeah.
- Larry, I've seen
everything on Broadway.

03:55.166 --> 03:57.125
- This is my office.
- It's a stupid fucking idea!

03:57.125 --> 03:59.834
Fatwa! People
don't wanna see that.
They want uplifting.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.708
- They want--
- You don't even know
what you're talking about!

04:01.708 --> 04:03.917
- You sound like a moron.
You know that?
- Do I, really?

04:03.917 --> 04:05.500
Yeah, you do.
It's a good idea.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.250
And by the way,
what the hell are you
doing here anyway?

04:07.250 --> 04:10.375
Well, I was in the area
looking-- ah-- for venues.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.875
- He-- does he know?
- No.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.542
Guess who's
getting married.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.917
- Sammi's getting married?
- Yes, my little Samella. Yes.

04:16.917 --> 04:18.667
- Who's the guy?
- He's a vet.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.792
- An Afghan war vet.
- Really?

04:20.792 --> 04:22.875
- He was a Marine.
- Don't you got to be careful

04:22.875 --> 04:26.084
with the, uh,
you know, the PTSD?

04:26.084 --> 04:27.208
He doesn't have PTSD.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.875
I would know.
I know things.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.625
You don't know.
You know, it comes on
in a year or two.

04:30.625 --> 04:33.166
He could wake up
in the middle of the night
and start punching.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.416
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- He could wake up...

04:35.416 --> 04:38.208
( chuckles )
...you know,
like that.

04:38.208 --> 04:41.708
All right. All right,
you guys are fuckin' morons.

04:41.708 --> 04:44.500
- Ah, you poor fucker.
- ( buzzer blares )

04:44.500 --> 04:46.375
- Secretary:
Your haircut's here.
- Yeah, send her in.

04:46.375 --> 04:49.000
- You get a haircut
in the office?
- Yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.458
- Betty!
- Hi, Susie!
How's it going?

04:50.458 --> 04:51.625
- How are you, my love?
- Good.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.708
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hiya, Betty.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.583
How are you?
Good to see you.

04:54.583 --> 04:55.750
Jeff:
Good to see you.

04:55.750 --> 04:56.625
Huh.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.792
So... sorry.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.000
Oh, it's fine.
I'm over it.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.084
- Really?
- Yeah, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

05:07.084 --> 05:09.166
He didn't open
the door for me.
It was a whole thing.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.917
- I was walking to the door.
He didn't open it.
- Because the tie

05:10.917 --> 05:13.208
- and the short hair...
- In fact, he let it shut.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.750
- ( overlapping voices )
- And then it was offensive
to me, obviously,

05:15.750 --> 05:18.125
because it's just--
'cause he thinks that
I wouldn't want the door open.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.042
- Anyway,
I'm awfully sorry.
- You know what? It's okay.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.084
- Water under the bridge.
- Water under the bridge.

05:23.084 --> 05:25.834
That's Betty.
Betty, you're too good,
I'll tell ya.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.917
She also happens to be
a lesbian.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.792
And she's marrying
her partner in a few weeks.

05:30.792 --> 05:32.750
( scoffs )
She's a lesbian.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.500
She takes such great pride
in having a lesbian friend.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.042
( mocking )
"Oh. Oh, look at me,
everybody.

05:38.042 --> 05:40.917
I'm so cool,
I hang out with lesbians."

05:40.917 --> 05:43.500
I had lesbian friends
before you knew what
lesbians were.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.708
- Hey, by the way...
- Uh-huh.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.250
...you know,
I could use a haircut.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.000
You could.
You could.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.625
And you know what?
I could do it for you.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.917
- Really?
- Yes, yes.
I can come to your house.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.959
And I'll open
the door for you.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.208
- ( chuckles ) Okay.
- Huh?

05:56.208 --> 05:58.458
- Huh? Come on. Right?
- All right.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.625
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.625
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.875
Hey, it's my
long-lost assistant.

06:11.875 --> 06:13.416
Welcome back!

06:13.416 --> 06:14.875
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

06:14.875 --> 06:19.125
You had a nice little
two-day unauthorized
vacation.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.125
Oh, not--
it wasn't a vacation.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.959
- Oh, it wasn't?
- No, I was-- I was
very constipated.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.834
- I couldn't poop.
- No, I know what
constipation is.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.166
You don't come to work
for two days

06:31.166 --> 06:32.917
because you were
constipated?

06:32.917 --> 06:35.166
Yeah. Luckily it was
only two days.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.375
The whole world
is out there constipated.

06:37.375 --> 06:39.250
Half the population
is constipated.

06:39.250 --> 06:42.625
I got married constipated.
People do things constipated.

06:42.625 --> 06:44.708
You wouldn't want me here.
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't...

06:44.708 --> 06:47.166
No, I would want you here.
Why wouldn't I want you here?

06:47.166 --> 06:50.416
I don't function well with
the feeling of heaviness.

06:50.416 --> 06:52.375
I feel like I'm wearing
a cement inner tube.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.959
- Mm-hmm.
- And now, I mean,

06:53.959 --> 06:56.125
it's about being available
for it to happen.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.542
And it hasn't
totally happened,
I'm gonna be honest.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.416
The blessed event
hasn't occurred yet?

07:00.416 --> 07:01.708
It's partially occurred,

07:01.708 --> 07:05.875
but I'm gonna soldier on
here at the office

07:05.875 --> 07:07.458
so that we can get
some stuff done.

07:07.458 --> 07:10.042
You're gonna
soldier on. Wow.

07:10.042 --> 07:13.333
( Scottish accent )
Aye, lassie. I admire
your courage.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.708
This is one of those fields,
like many, that isn't
researched enough.

07:16.708 --> 07:21.583
Perhaps, you-- you could
champion the cause
of constipation.

07:21.583 --> 07:25.542
( laughs )
You could--
you could raise money.

07:25.542 --> 07:28.291
You could go on,
you could have fundraisers.

07:28.291 --> 07:30.708
You know, you could--
you could have groups

07:30.708 --> 07:33.500
where people
who are constipated
get together and--

07:33.500 --> 07:35.750
and talk about
their problems.

07:35.750 --> 07:39.416
- I don't--
- In fact, you know what else
you might wanna think about?

07:39.416 --> 07:42.208
Instead of sitting
in a chair at your desk,

07:42.208 --> 07:44.625
put in a toilet seat.
( chuckles )

07:44.625 --> 07:46.500
You know,
have an office bathroom.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.416
Maybe something to
consider for the future

07:48.416 --> 07:50.291
if you wanted to look
into the plumbing.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.208
- Come on.
Not a bad idea.
- Um, anyway.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.917
Well, uh, I did
get a voicemail,
and Richard Lewis called.

07:55.917 --> 07:59.125
And, uh, unfortunately,
his parakeet died.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.291
Aw. Hmm.

08:01.291 --> 08:04.750
- Had you ever met him?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.333
- What was he like?
- Bird-like. He was bird-like.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.834
- Yeah.
- You know what?
I'll cheer him up.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.959
I'll send him a little text.
How about that?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.750
Yeah, well,
I think for death,

08:13.750 --> 08:15.917
sometimes a text
is inadequate.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.583
Yes, perhaps
if it were a person,

08:18.583 --> 08:20.875
I would agree with you.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.708
- All right. Done.
He's gonna love it.
- ( phone chirps )

08:23.708 --> 08:25.959
Hey, do me a favor.

08:25.959 --> 08:28.375
This pen
is out of ink.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.583
I need a refill.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.125
Okay?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.583
There you go.

08:33.583 --> 08:35.291
And you....

08:35.291 --> 08:37.000
There you go.
You got the refill.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.125
You have the refill.

08:41.458 --> 08:42.750
You have the refill.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.625
I worry I'm gonna lose
something this small.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.000
You take that.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.416
- And I will
look that up.
- Okay.

08:51.416 --> 08:53.125
Okay.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.959
And think
about that toilet.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.959
- The chair toilet.
- All right.

08:56.959 --> 08:59.959
You just sit there
at your desk.

08:59.959 --> 09:01.416
Pretty good idea.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.959
( muffled music thumping )

09:12.333 --> 09:14.500
( muffled music continues )

09:26.000 --> 09:29.166
( music blaring )

09:29.166 --> 09:30.166
Hey.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.084
- Come on.
- What's up?

09:33.084 --> 09:34.667
Turn this down.
It's too loud.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.416
- What's too fucking loud?
- I hear it on the street.

09:36.416 --> 09:38.250
Wait-- just wait
a fuckin' minute.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.000
- I'll turn
this shit down, okay?
- ( music fades )

09:40.000 --> 09:42.416
- Yeah. What are you doing?
- Ah. You okay?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.625
- Yeah. What are you doing?
- I'm fuckin' lamping.
What you doing?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.084
You're lamping?

09:46.084 --> 09:47.875
Chillin'.
Relaxing.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.042
Why did you change it
from chillin'?

09:49.042 --> 09:50.250
What was wrong
with chillin'?

09:50.250 --> 09:51.917
Got to get another one?
Lamping?

09:51.917 --> 09:53.708
Lamping.
I can sit around here
with some fuckin' boxers on

09:53.708 --> 09:55.416
and a tank top
with my feet the fuck up.

09:55.416 --> 09:58.708
And chillin' is what?
You gotta be in real clothes?

09:58.708 --> 10:00.875
- You can walk around
and chill.
- Oh.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.875
You upright.
You chillin' upright.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.708
You guys got
some great slang,
I gotta say.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.000
- The fuck you got?
- We got boss.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.208
That's a boss shirt.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.166
- Oh, man.
- Huh?

10:09.166 --> 10:10.542
You can keep
that boss shit.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.333
- Keep that bullshit.
- Boss isn't--

10:12.333 --> 10:14.166
boss isn't happening,
is it, huh?

10:14.166 --> 10:15.875
Hey, I wouldn't even
say that shit by mistake.

10:15.875 --> 10:19.291
Get this--
my assistant, okay,

10:19.291 --> 10:21.333
doesn't come to work
for two days.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.917
You know why?
You know what
she tells me?

10:23.917 --> 10:26.042
- What?
- She was constipated.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.583
Who doesn't come to work
'cause they're constipated?

10:29.583 --> 10:30.959
Have you ever
heard of that?

10:30.959 --> 10:32.834
- Fuck, no. Come on, man.
- Ridiculous.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.667
Come on, I shot
a porno constipated.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.416
I ran a 5k marathon
constipated.

10:37.416 --> 10:38.917
Shit, man, come on.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.458
I was in a hot dog-eating
contest constipated.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.084
Hold it, hold it,
hold it.

10:43.084 --> 10:44.542
You shot a porno?

10:44.542 --> 10:45.875
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Seriously.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.125
And a hot dog-eating
contest constipated.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.542
And I still fucking won.
That's not a fucking excuse.

10:50.542 --> 10:54.250
You cannot let
this bitch use constipation
as something to lean on.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.708
You got to
fire that bitch.

10:55.708 --> 10:58.458
Yeah, well, that's
easier said than done.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.583
It's, you know--
she's got a--

11:00.583 --> 11:02.458
she's got a limp
and a cane.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.917
I'd feel sorry for her.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.708
I can't.
I can't do it.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.792
And by the way,
that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.375
Okay.
What the fuck else
could it be?

11:09.375 --> 11:10.625
I'm not at liberty
to-- to say.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.125
- I can't say.
- What is it?

11:12.125 --> 11:13.625
I don't wanna say.
I don't wanna talk about it.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.291
You fucking walk all the way
the fuck over here,

11:15.291 --> 11:17.000
you disturb me
from fucking lamping,

11:17.000 --> 11:18.458
and you ain't even
gonna fucking tell me
what the fuck it is?

11:18.458 --> 11:19.625
I-- I--
I can't say.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.750
Tell me what the fuck
going on.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.125
( sighs )

11:22.125 --> 11:24.208
Let's just say
her uncle fucked her.

11:24.208 --> 11:27.291
- Recently?
- No, no. Years ago.

11:27.291 --> 11:30.667
- Oh, shit, man.
- You see-- you see
the dilemma that I have?

11:30.667 --> 11:32.625
Between the limp
and the cane and the uncle...

11:32.625 --> 11:34.792
( stammering )
she's unfirable.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.792
- God damn it, man,
you can't fucking fire her.
- I can't fire her, I know.

11:36.792 --> 11:38.750
And the thing about it
is that

11:38.750 --> 11:40.625
she was so highly
recommended, too.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.333
She used to work
for Jimmy Kimmel
and he recommended her to me.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.500
He said she was great,
and she's awful.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.333
Why would
he recommend her?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.959
I know what
the fuck happened.

11:50.959 --> 11:52.333
He foisted you, man.

11:52.333 --> 11:56.166
Fucking Jimmy Kimmel
foisted that bitch on you.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.667
What do you mean?

11:57.667 --> 11:59.166
He couldn't
fire her either,

11:59.166 --> 12:00.625
so he passed her ass
onto you.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.583
Don't you ever
allow yourself
to get foisted.

12:02.583 --> 12:05.458
- You understand?
That fucking limpy-ass girl--
- I got foisted.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.500
Now, the only way
to resolve this shit,

12:07.500 --> 12:10.667
go in your fucking mind
and you think of someone

12:10.667 --> 12:13.333
you can unload
this limpy bitch onto.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.708
You have to get rid
of this bitch.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.834
You know what,
every now and then--

12:17.834 --> 12:21.834
every now and then,
yeah, I gotta say,
you surprise me.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.208
Whoo.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.875
Boom. Boom.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.291
Is that still workable?

12:26.291 --> 12:27.834
The fist bump?
Is that still...?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.416
There's people
still doing that, yeah.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.375
Will you let me know
when that goes out of fashion?

12:31.375 --> 12:32.875
When that shit stop,
I'll let you know.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.542
And if you see me
doing anything else

12:34.542 --> 12:38.125
that the black community
might frown upon as
being uncool,

12:38.125 --> 12:39.333
you're gonna
let me know.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.166
I'll stop your ass.
You know I will.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.708
( chuckles )
Now go upstairs
and start lamping.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.792
I'm so excited
right now.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.333
- Like, I can't
even tell you.
- Sure.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.042
I just never thought that
I'd be having a wedding.

12:52.042 --> 12:54.166
- Have you been married?
- I have, yes.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.250
So, you've had a wedding,
so you know how awesome it is.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.125
- Yeah, but I wasn't
excited in the least.
- Oh, you weren't?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.708
- No. But I never
get excited, you know.
- About anything?

13:00.708 --> 13:02.084
No, my mother
used to say to me,

13:02.084 --> 13:04.042
"Larry, you--
you never get excited."

13:04.042 --> 13:05.667
- Really?
- "Can't you be excited?"

13:05.667 --> 13:08.500
It-- it broke her heart.
I-- there's no excitement.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.458
Well, I'm excited,

13:10.458 --> 13:12.250
- so I appreciate
you letting me talk.
- That's-- that's great.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.416
I have a couple
of questions, logistically,

13:14.416 --> 13:15.834
about how
the whole thing works.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.625
- Okay.
- So, when the rabbi

13:17.625 --> 13:19.583
or the minister
or whoever says,

13:19.583 --> 13:22.084
"Do you take so-and-so--"
what's your fiancée's name?

13:22.084 --> 13:25.708
- Numa.
- Numa. "Do you take Numa to be
your lawfully wedded wife..."

13:25.708 --> 13:27.000
It doesn't really
work like that.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.583
Oh. Okay,
but what about, um,

13:29.583 --> 13:31.291
"Here Comes The Bride"?
Who gets the song?

13:31.291 --> 13:34.416
- I'm getting that song.
- You're getting the song?

13:34.416 --> 13:36.208
You're getting
"Here Comes the Bride"?

13:36.208 --> 13:38.333
Yeah.
That's my song.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.959
I wanted
to be the bride

13:39.959 --> 13:42.084
and Numa's actually
always wanted to be the groom,

13:42.084 --> 13:43.625
so it worked out good.

13:43.625 --> 13:48.250
Not really getting,
uh, bride vibes from you.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.583
Well, that's 'cause
you're not at the wedding...

13:50.583 --> 13:52.542
With all due respect,
yeah, I don't see bride.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.667
I don't see bride,
okay, from here.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.834
No, try and see it.
Try and see it.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.708
- We're at the wedding--
- I can't see it.

13:58.708 --> 14:01.583
- My dad walks me
down the-- the thing.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.291
I have a veil
with, like,

14:03.291 --> 14:05.708
- a flower--
- Oh, my God,
you got the gown, too?

14:05.708 --> 14:08.458
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, this is
a huge, huge mistake.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.416
- No, it's-- um,
it's amazing.
- No.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.625
Look, you got
a picture of Numa?

14:13.208 --> 14:16.416
Okay, she's beautiful,
obviously.

14:16.416 --> 14:20.875
( scoffs ) Okay.
That's a-- that's
a bride, okay?

14:20.875 --> 14:23.125
- Well...
- That's a bride.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.708
That's a groom.

14:24.708 --> 14:27.583
Believe me,
I say this only with
the best intentions.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.792
That's a fuckin' bride.
You a goddamn groom.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.333
- The groom, right?
- You a goddamn groom.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.125
- Yeah.
- What's her name?

14:33.125 --> 14:35.667
- Numa.
- Numa fine as fuck.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.458
- Right? She is.
- You are one lucky-ass groom.

14:37.458 --> 14:38.875
- Thank you.
- She gorgeous?

14:38.875 --> 14:40.667
Leon:
I'll see you later. Mm.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.333
Hey, we need
more peanut butter.

14:42.333 --> 14:45.208
Okay, well,
we're done.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.834
Oh. Uh, how much
do I owe you?

14:47.834 --> 14:50.375
- Uh, 150.
- ( scoffs ) 150?

14:50.375 --> 14:52.042
Yeah, boy,
you're gonna love that.

14:52.042 --> 14:55.166
Oh, boy, you're making
quite a living there
barbering.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.667
150 for a bald man?

14:56.667 --> 14:58.166
- For a haircut?
- Yeah, well, you're not bald.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.667
- You do have hair.
- Well... yeah.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.333
- So, thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.917
Think about
what I said.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.250
- Okay?
- Thank you.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.625
You're a lovely girl,
Betty, but, uh,

15:08.625 --> 15:10.959
you're not a bride.

15:10.959 --> 15:14.000
Unfortunately.
Unfortunately.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.875
( chatter )

15:19.416 --> 15:21.583
( chatter continues )

15:21.583 --> 15:23.500
So, this is
more of the kick-off,

15:23.500 --> 15:25.959
- and then we'll have
a big gala--
- Cheryl?

15:25.959 --> 15:27.542
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hey!

15:27.542 --> 15:29.125
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.166
- Oh, really?
- Thank you for coming.

15:31.166 --> 15:33.458
What is
this name, PAM?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.416
That's the best
you could do?

15:35.416 --> 15:37.708
It's like--
it's a cooking spray-- PAM.

15:37.708 --> 15:41.917
No, it's People
Against Mutilation,
genital mutilation.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.750
Yeah, I know
what it stands for.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.291
And there are
very few charities

15:45.291 --> 15:47.500
that actually
focus on the clitoris
and talk about it.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.583
I think you got
half the population

15:50.583 --> 15:51.917
focused on
the clitoris.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.125
- I'm deadly focused on it.
- You are?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.084
- Yeah.
- Hey.

15:57.084 --> 15:59.959
- Hey, Ted!
- How are you?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.250
- I haven't seen you
in a while.
- I know!

16:02.250 --> 16:05.000
- I know.
It's nice to see you.
- Where's Mary?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.500
Mary? Oh, uh, yeah...
( sighs )

16:07.500 --> 16:10.000
Oh, you know, I haven't
seen you guys for so long.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.667
Mary and I have
been separated for, like,
three months, you know.

16:13.667 --> 16:16.084
- The divorce
is almost final.
- What?

16:16.084 --> 16:17.750
- My bad. Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.416
- Holy mackerel.
- I am shocked.

16:19.416 --> 16:22.291
Oh, no, no, no.
Truth is I think
we're better friends now

16:22.291 --> 16:23.375
than when
we were married.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.792
That's total bullshit.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.959
You just-- you have
to say that to yourselves

16:26.959 --> 16:29.084
to wean yourself
off the relationship.

16:29.084 --> 16:31.250
- What is that?
- It's a breath spray.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.750
Oh, thank God.
I think Jeff's
looking for you.

16:33.750 --> 16:36.375
Yeah, one second.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.959
Gotta go talk
to my manager.

16:37.959 --> 16:40.291
- Okay.
- Big stuff happening.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.166
- Ooh.
- Big stuff.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.542
- Strangest man
on the planet.
- ( chuckles ) I know.

16:44.542 --> 16:47.291
Crazy,
crazy exciting.

16:47.291 --> 16:49.333
- Really?
- Yep.

16:49.333 --> 16:53.208
Every producer
I sent "Fatwa!" to is in.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.625
- Wow.
- Every producer
I talked to.

16:55.625 --> 16:59.291
I've got so many producers
that want to do this.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.291
Look at you,
Mr. Broadway.
( scoffs )

17:01.291 --> 17:03.458
Got you booked
on "Jimmy Kimmel"
to talk about it already.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.959
- Really?
Do I need to do that?
- Yep.

17:04.959 --> 17:06.333
Oh, yeah,
you need to do that.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.792
Get out there,
start talking about this.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.125
This is very exciting.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.125
Hey, how much does
Betty charge you
for a haircut?

17:12.125 --> 17:14.792
- 75.
- She charged me $150.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.583
- Twice as much?
- Twice as much.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.375
- That's crazy.
- I know it's crazy.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.166
- Why would she do
something like that?
- I don't know.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.500
- She ripped me off.
- You want me to call her?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.583
No, no, no.
I'm gonna say
something to her.

17:24.583 --> 17:25.875
- Feel free.
- Good.

17:25.875 --> 17:28.000
Hey, it's Lewis.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.208
Come here.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.750
- I'll meet you
over there.
- Cool, cool.

17:42.750 --> 17:45.000
All right,
I'll meet you
over there. Fine.

17:49.084 --> 17:51.042
- Happy?
- No, I'm not, actually.

17:51.042 --> 17:52.834
- This is not the middle.
- I don't move again.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.875
The middle--
the middle would've
been over there.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.500
I took way more steps
than you did to get here.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.084
- I'm older than you.
- Hey, by the way, good news
about "Fatwa!"

18:01.084 --> 18:02.500
There's a lot of producers
interested in it.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.208
I don't care about
your fucking play,

18:04.208 --> 18:05.834
'cause my bird died

18:05.834 --> 18:09.208
and you sent the most
ridiculous, despicable text.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.042
"Sorry about your bird.

18:11.042 --> 18:13.792
The good news is
I'm still alive."

18:13.792 --> 18:15.416
- Prick.
- Prick?

18:15.416 --> 18:17.917
This is a tragedy
and you treated it
like it was nothing to me.

18:17.917 --> 18:20.625
- How dare you?
- I-- I don't see it
as a tragedy.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.375
You don't? Why not?
It's my bird.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.042
- If it was a parrot,
it would be a tragedy.
- Oh, really?

18:24.042 --> 18:25.792
Or some exotic bird
from Brazil

18:25.792 --> 18:27.667
like a macaw
or a toucan.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.708
I don't live in
a Cuban dancehall.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.375
I live in my own home
and it doesn't take toucans.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.667
You know,
it's a dead parakeet.
That's a funny thing.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.166
I loved him.
It was unconditional love.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.375
- It was-- even--
- Unconditional love?

18:40.375 --> 18:42.750
- He came over--
- He doesn't know you
from a hole in the wall.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.375
He knows me. He knew you.
Remember he came over once?

18:44.375 --> 18:46.708
He went, "Seinfeld, Seinfeld."
He loved you, too.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.625
I'm not quite sure
it was "Seinfeld."

18:48.625 --> 18:50.834
( imitates parakeet )
And you-- you thought
that was "Seinfeld."

18:50.834 --> 18:52.416
- Yeah.
- No.

18:52.416 --> 18:54.333
( imitates parakeet )
Yeah, that's not Seinfeld.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.750
You know why I'm laughing?
At the sadness of your
entire existence.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.208
- Well...
- You're so unjust--

18:59.208 --> 19:01.000
I take that
as a great compliment.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.583
Well, there's a lack
of empathy and compassion

19:02.583 --> 19:04.792
and sympathy for practically
everything in your life.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.583
There's a lack
of everything.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.542
- Don't you feel good about--
- Look, you're a comedian.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.416
You're supposed to be able
to take a joke, you know?

19:10.416 --> 19:12.416
You're supposed to laugh
about everything.

19:12.416 --> 19:14.708
Just because I'm a comedian,
I have to find everything
in the world funny?

19:14.708 --> 19:16.000
Yes,
everything's funny.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.542
You're devoid
of anything

19:17.542 --> 19:20.084
that's remotely caring
or empathetic.

19:20.084 --> 19:23.291
- And it's sad, and I--
- Are you sure a dead parakeet
isn't funny?

19:23.291 --> 19:24.750
This, to me,
is a tragedy.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.625
- I'm gonna go.
- I'm gonna go, too.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.291
- I'm going this way.
- No, no, I'm going this way.

19:29.291 --> 19:30.834
No, you came
from that way.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.625
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

19:32.625 --> 19:33.625
No, I wanna
go that way.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.375
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hey.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.959
I'm late, I'm late.
I know.

19:39.959 --> 19:41.625
Nice of you
to show up.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.750
Well, Larry,
I've been so crazy busy.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.125
I've never been
like this in my life.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.875
Did Jeff tell you
about my new business?

19:46.875 --> 19:48.250
I heard something.
What is it?

19:48.250 --> 19:49.625
Soaps On.

19:49.625 --> 19:53.500
It's a skin care,
bath products,
all organic...

19:53.500 --> 19:55.416
- Soaps On?
- ...sustainable.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.625
Could you come up with
a worse name than Soaps On?

19:57.625 --> 19:58.917
It's a great name.
You know, you don't know

19:58.917 --> 20:00.416
what the fuck
you're talking about.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.500
- It's a great name.
- Okay, good, good.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.917
So, what have you been doing?
You've been working
at night on it?

20:04.917 --> 20:08.000
Nonstop.
I think I'm gonna
have to hire an assistant.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
I think I have to maybe--
maybe more than one.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.458
What?

20:13.458 --> 20:16.333
Did I just hear you say
you needed to hire
an assistant?

20:16.333 --> 20:19.291
I think I do, yeah.
I'm burning the candles
on both ends.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.333
- Oh, my God.
- What?

20:21.333 --> 20:25.375
Well, you know, I'm gonna
be going to New York
to do the play.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.875
Yeah, "Fatwa!"

20:26.875 --> 20:29.375
And I'm not gonna be able
to take my assistant.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.291
- She's good?
- Oh, good?

20:31.291 --> 20:33.084
She's-- she's the best
I ever had.

20:33.084 --> 20:34.750
Well, what's her history?
Where-- where is she--

20:34.750 --> 20:36.542
- Oh, she worked for Kimmel.
- Jimmy Kimmel?

20:36.542 --> 20:38.500
- Yeah.
- Oh, he's a big star.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.959
- Ah...
- What? What?

20:41.959 --> 20:43.208
- Come on, what?
- Eh...

20:43.208 --> 20:45.333
- What?
- I can't give her up.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.125
- I-- I can't. She's--
- What are you gonna
use her for?

20:48.125 --> 20:51.208
You're gonna be
on the phone with her here
and you're in New York?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.834
That's ridiculous.
That doesn't make any sense.

20:53.834 --> 20:56.333
You need to hire
a new assistant in New York

20:56.333 --> 20:57.917
and let me
take this one.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.084
What the hell?
You can have her!

20:59.084 --> 21:01.166
- Ah! Yay!
- Huh? Yeah!

21:01.166 --> 21:03.375
- Oh, I love you so much!
- Ha ha! Yeah?

21:03.375 --> 21:05.042
Oh, this is great!
I feel like a weight

21:05.042 --> 21:07.333
has been lifted
off my shoulders, Lar.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.375
- Me, too.
- You won't be sorry.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.375
Trust me.
Fantastic!

21:11.375 --> 21:13.625
Pretty good.

21:13.625 --> 21:18.917
Pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty good.

21:22.042 --> 21:24.416
( women arguing )

21:26.458 --> 21:28.542
Betty:
I'm not saying
you can't be the groom.

21:28.542 --> 21:32.291
I'm just saying
I think I might not
be the bride.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.792
I saw myself
and then I'm gonna
walk down the--

21:35.792 --> 21:38.000
Wha-- Larry?
What are you doing here?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.625
The door--
the door was ajar.

21:41.625 --> 21:44.959
You! You're the one
that put this in her head?

21:44.959 --> 21:48.792
- What? What? I--
- What is your agenda, man?

21:48.792 --> 21:51.792
- No, I didn't do anything.
- Of course he just
shows up, too.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.750
- Out of nowhere.
Just-- you're here now.
- The door was ajar.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.250
The-- you left
the door ajar.

21:56.250 --> 21:59.042
You have
no business weighing in
on this wedding, okay?

21:59.042 --> 22:00.834
It's not completely
his fault, um, but--

22:00.834 --> 22:02.750
( stammering )
No, I just thought--

22:02.750 --> 22:04.375
look, you're
a beautiful bride.

22:04.375 --> 22:06.125
- You should be a bride.
- I'm the groom.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.458
I don't wanna be
the bride.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.500
You're not groomy,
she's not bridey.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.416
- You know--
- How is it appropriate for you
to have an opinion about this?

22:12.416 --> 22:15.667
Well, because I know her.
She gave me a haircut.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.042
She charged a lot of money
for it, by the way.

22:18.042 --> 22:20.084
What kind of psychopath

22:20.084 --> 22:23.625
interferes with the nuances
of a lesbian wedding?

22:23.625 --> 22:27.458
Hey, I saw wrong
and tried to right it.
That's all.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.042
- I can't believe--
- That's what Ted Kennedy said

22:29.042 --> 22:31.125
about Robert Kennedy
at his funeral.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.750
I'm-- I'm like
Robert Kennedy.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.667
You know what's not
Robert Kennedy-ish?

22:34.667 --> 22:36.792
- Hmm?
- Wandering into
people's homes

22:36.792 --> 22:38.250
and spouting nonsense.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.625
Oh. Okay.
Well, don't leave
the door ajar.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.000
- Stop saying "ajar"!
- Okay.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.458
What is really going on here?
Do you need a hobby?

22:44.458 --> 22:46.250
( scoffs )
Not a terrible idea.

22:46.250 --> 22:47.458
You're-- you're right
about that.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.166
That's-- that's
a good idea.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.208
I just can't seem
to find the motivation.

22:51.208 --> 22:53.500
You know, when I was a kid,
I would collect butterflies.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.625
I would go in the park,
I had a-- a net,

22:55.625 --> 22:57.375
and I would--
I would use the net.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.667
I cannot tell you
how much satisfaction
there is

22:59.667 --> 23:01.708
in trapping
a butterfly in a net...

23:01.708 --> 23:04.125
- ( overlapping voices )
- I didn't expect you to
actually answer--

23:04.125 --> 23:07.000
I didn't expect
an actual answer
to that question!

23:07.000 --> 23:08.458
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter about him.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.042
- It doesn't--
- I'm done.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.792
It doesn't matter about him.
I just want you to be happy.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.875
I want us to have
a successful wedding
and a successful life.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.250
- Fantastic.
- I'll do anything you want.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.500
- Whatever you want.
- I wanna be the groom.

23:20.792 --> 23:22.208
You waited too long.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.667
That's everything
I need to know.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.500
- No, no, no!
- Here is your ring.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.959
- I wish this
friendship the best.
- No. Oh...

23:26.959 --> 23:29.166
- What...?
- Aw, come on.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.667
No. No, don't-- no.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.084
Come, come-- no.

23:32.084 --> 23:34.375
- Here, allow me.
- What the fuck are you doing?

23:34.375 --> 23:37.333
- No good?
- I don't need you to hold
the door for me, you prick.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.084
You see?
See what happens?

23:41.084 --> 23:42.542
I held the door,
she didn't like it.

23:42.542 --> 23:44.208
You chastised me
for holding the door.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.875
What's a guy supposed to do?
I'm betwixt and between.

23:46.875 --> 23:49.042
- Why are you here?
- I'll tell you why I'm here.

23:49.042 --> 23:51.500
'Cause I asked Jeff
what you charged him
for a haircut

23:51.500 --> 23:53.042
and he told me $75.

23:53.042 --> 23:54.875
- Uh-huh.
- You charged me $150.

23:54.875 --> 23:56.291
- Mm-hmm.
- What's up with that?

23:56.291 --> 23:58.000
Get the fuck
out of my house.

24:00.375 --> 24:01.250
Okay.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.416
Are you sure...?

24:07.416 --> 24:09.583
Okay, I got it.
I got that.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.834
( sing-song )
I've got some news.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.583
Wha-- what is it?

24:20.583 --> 24:22.917
Okay, 'cause of the musical,
I might be going to New York.

24:22.917 --> 24:26.542
And I thought,
"What am I gonna do
about Mara?"

24:26.542 --> 24:27.917
So, guess what.

24:27.917 --> 24:31.291
I got you a job
with my friend,

24:31.291 --> 24:33.917
a very close friend of mine,
as her assistant.

24:33.917 --> 24:36.625
She's starting
this new company
called Soaps On

24:36.625 --> 24:40.583
- for natural bath
and beauty products--
- Larry, th-thank you. I--

24:40.583 --> 24:42.375
This woman really knows
what she's doing.

24:42.375 --> 24:46.042
And by the way,
she's such a terrific person.

24:46.042 --> 24:49.042
This woman's a--
she's a fucking saint, okay?

24:49.042 --> 24:52.458
Well, okay. I mean...
( sighs )

24:52.458 --> 24:54.583
Don't take this
the wrong way.

24:54.583 --> 24:56.875
Always, this job
felt a little bit

24:56.875 --> 24:58.917
- like it wasn't
challenging enough.
- Is that so?

24:58.917 --> 25:00.959
So this-- this could be
a good opportunity.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.792
We can start
right now.

25:02.792 --> 25:05.458
Yeah, let's pack you up
and let's get you the hell
out of here.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.750
- Thank you.
- Thank you for all
the-- the-- the work,

25:07.750 --> 25:10.708
the hard work that you did,
even though it wasn't very
challenging at all.

25:10.708 --> 25:13.625
- And I don't even know
what you did, exactly, but...
- You know, I just-- it just--

25:13.625 --> 25:15.291
...you claim
to have done something,
but I'm sure you did.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.583
Anyway, let's go.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.917
- There we go.
- Careful.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.917
There we go.
You got this,
you got all this.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.208
Oh, look,
you got little cookies
and cakes here.

25:22.208 --> 25:23.750
Okay, take the plant.
Yeah.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.583
There you go.
Okay.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.500
Take your water.
Get this out.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.959
- I just--
- What else?
We're done. We're good.

25:29.959 --> 25:31.792
There we go.

25:31.792 --> 25:34.750
Okay. Oh, yeah,
you're gonna have
a good time.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.291
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah. Can't you walk a little
faster with that thing?

25:37.291 --> 25:40.375
They-- they have
Olympic events for that.
They speed along.

25:40.375 --> 25:44.250
Do you want to get
a celebratory drink or...?

25:44.250 --> 25:46.125
Nah.
I don't think so.

25:46.125 --> 25:49.708
All right, then.
Well, should we--
should we hug goodbye?

25:49.708 --> 25:53.084
I'll tell you what.
Let's do one of these.

25:53.084 --> 25:54.416
There we go.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.000
Now you got your box,
we had a little hug.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.125
- Thanks, Larry.
- All right, you take care.

25:58.125 --> 25:59.416
- All right.
- We'll see ya.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.166
- Bye, Leon.
- Give my best to Susie.

26:01.166 --> 26:02.959
- Tell her I said hi.
- See ya.

26:06.917 --> 26:10.250
- ( door closes )
- Tell me that's what the fuck
I think it is.

26:10.250 --> 26:12.500
- That's a foist.
- Mm, fuck!

26:12.500 --> 26:14.208
That was a foist!

26:14.208 --> 26:15.625
- My man, look at you.
- Yep!

26:15.625 --> 26:17.166
- You did it!
- Huh? How 'bout that?

26:17.166 --> 26:18.959
She ain't gonna limp her ass
back up in here, right?

26:18.959 --> 26:20.542
- Oh, no chance.
- Draggin' that goddamn
foot, right?

26:20.542 --> 26:21.834
No chance.
She's been foisted, man.

26:21.834 --> 26:23.583
So she's not
coming back?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.250
- Nope.
- She's out of here
for good?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.875
- Out.
- ( chuckles )

26:26.875 --> 26:29.667
I can do this.

26:29.667 --> 26:31.166
What?
What are you
talkin' about?

26:31.166 --> 26:32.416
I can do this shit.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.875
What?
Do what shit?

26:33.875 --> 26:35.583
I can be
your new assistant.

26:35.583 --> 26:38.000
Oh, no, no, no.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.583
That's--
that's impossible.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.333
Come on, man.

26:42.333 --> 26:45.333
( phone ringing )

26:45.333 --> 26:48.542
Larry David's office.
What the fuck is up?

26:50.125 --> 26:52.416
Oh, I'm sorry,
that bitch got foisted.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.375
You only get half price
'cause you drive a goddamn
Smart car.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.875
All right?

26:59.875 --> 27:01.208
Don't call me
no fucking more.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.625
Mm.

27:03.625 --> 27:05.042
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, how you doin'?

27:05.042 --> 27:06.750
What's happening?
Good to see you.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.625
- Good to see you. Hi.
- How are you? Welcome.

27:08.625 --> 27:11.291
- What's going on?
- Not-- this is Leon,
by the way.

27:11.291 --> 27:13.125
- This is Jimmy.
- Good to be here, baby.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.125
- Good to have you here.
- He's my temporary assistant.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.000
- ( phone chiming )
- Hold on, hold on.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.250
Hey, Jeff.
What's up?

27:19.250 --> 27:21.917
- Hey. Is that for me?
- We at "Jimmy Kimmel."

27:21.917 --> 27:23.250
I'm gonna
take it outside.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.542
Fucking good as fuck.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.625
- What is this, crudité?
- Yeah, crudité, yeah.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.208
Crudi-take.

27:28.208 --> 27:29.458
All right?

27:29.458 --> 27:30.583
What are you doing?
Don't take that.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.250
It's fine because--
no, we--

27:32.250 --> 27:34.542
- it's not like we reuse it.
- Hey, are you nuts?

27:34.542 --> 27:36.917
- Put the fucking
thing back, you asshole.
- Fuck you, Larry! Fuck you!

27:36.917 --> 27:39.000
- So, Jeff...
- ( chuckles )

27:39.000 --> 27:40.917
- He's not gonna take it.
It's a joke.
- Okay. Yeah.

27:40.917 --> 27:43.084
- How you doing?
Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Good.

27:43.084 --> 27:45.917
- What have you been up to?
- Uh, you know, just lampin'.

27:45.917 --> 27:48.917
Lamping?
Like L-A-M-P-I-N-G?

27:48.917 --> 27:50.375
There's no "G"
at the end.
Lampin'.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.625
Lampin'. Okay.
All right. Is that--

27:52.625 --> 27:55.166
- It's black slang.
I pick it up from him.
- Oh, okay. Oh, all right.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.708
- I didn't realize that.
- But, um... let me, uh--

27:57.708 --> 27:59.917
let me congratulate you,
by the way.

27:59.917 --> 28:01.208
Oh, thank-- on what?

28:01.208 --> 28:05.625
On the wonderful,
fantastic job

28:05.625 --> 28:07.208
of foisting
that you did.

28:07.208 --> 28:09.250
- What do you mean?
- Nice job.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.291
You foisted Mara
on me.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.416
I did foist her
on you.

28:15.416 --> 28:17.875
- I did. I really did
foist her on you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.667
- Fantastic foist.
- I told--

28:19.667 --> 28:22.084
and by the way, Marty Short
foisted her on me.

28:22.084 --> 28:24.834
He foisted her on you.
Okay, well, guess what.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.125
You've gotta now
foist her on somebody else.

28:27.125 --> 28:28.875
- Yeah.
- Done. It's already done.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.333
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.208
- It feels good, right?
- Thank you. Oh, my God.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.959
It's like
a pyramid scheme, almost.

28:33.959 --> 28:35.667
Uh, yeah.
In a way, yes.

28:35.667 --> 28:37.375
Eventually there will--
somebody at the end

28:37.375 --> 28:38.625
will have
to marry her.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.875
- Exactly!
Exactly, yeah.
- Yeah.

28:40.875 --> 28:43.042
Well, thanks for coming.
It's great to have you here.

28:43.042 --> 28:44.667
- Yeah, thanks.
I'll see you out there.
- All right, see you out there.

28:44.667 --> 28:46.000
- Take it easy.
- It's gonna be fun.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.166
Now, um, I understand
you have a new project.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.583
New-- something
you're working on.

28:49.583 --> 28:51.500
Yes, yes.
I've, uh--

28:51.500 --> 28:54.542
I've written
a musical for Broadway.

28:54.542 --> 28:57.834
- Mm-hmm?
- It's called,
uh, "Fatwa!"

28:57.834 --> 28:59.667
- ( audience laughing )
- "Fatwa"?

28:59.667 --> 29:01.834
- "Fatwa!"
- And what is a fatwa?

29:01.834 --> 29:07.333
A fatwa is a death sentence
handed out by the ayatollah.

29:07.333 --> 29:08.667
And this is a comedy?

29:08.667 --> 29:10.458
- Yes, yes.
- Okay. All right.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.834
It's a musical comedy.

29:11.834 --> 29:12.959
The ayatollah's in it.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.333
Oh, the ayatollah
is in it?

29:14.333 --> 29:15.667
Of course the ayatollah
is in it.

29:15.667 --> 29:17.458
How can you have a fatwa
without an ayatollah?

29:17.458 --> 29:18.708
You do need
an ayatollah, right.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.583
What appeals to you
about the ayatollah?

29:20.583 --> 29:23.084
The whole-- you know,
the denunciation.

29:23.084 --> 29:25.250
There's a lot
of denunciation going on.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.959
- The denunciation, okay.
- All day long, he's
denunciating.

29:27.959 --> 29:31.500
- He does do a lot of that.
- He does a lot of this,
a lot of, you know.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.708
- Uh-huh.
- By the way,
I just did it four times.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.375
I started to get
denunciation elbows.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.625
- You have to be careful.
- Yeah, you gotta be careful.

29:37.625 --> 29:40.542
- You can kill yourself.
- It's not easy to be
the ayatollah.

29:40.542 --> 29:42.375
It requires
a lot of energy.
Yeah, yeah.

29:42.375 --> 29:45.917
How many ayatollahs are there?
Are there only one ayatollah?

29:45.917 --> 29:47.375
Well, now there's
only one ayatollah,

29:47.375 --> 29:49.875
and they all seem
to have the same name

29:49.875 --> 29:52.125
and they all seem
to spell it the same way.

29:52.125 --> 29:55.959
And you never know--
if you look at the history
of ayatollahs,

29:55.959 --> 29:57.959
they-- it all seems
like one person.

29:57.959 --> 30:00.500
- Yeah, yeah.
- They all look
exactly the same,

30:00.500 --> 30:04.042
and their names are
Khamenei, Khameeni,
Khomani.

30:04.042 --> 30:06.125
In a way,
it's like the way KFC

30:06.125 --> 30:08.291
- has the different comedians
play Colonel Sanders.
- Yes, yes.

30:08.291 --> 30:11.250
- It's the same thing.
- What else about the ayatollah
do you know?

30:11.250 --> 30:13.708
He's, uh--
he doesn't like Waze.

30:13.708 --> 30:17.625
He likes-- he likes to--
he likes to navigate
on his own, you know?

30:17.625 --> 30:19.542
- Oh, Waze, okay.
- Yeah, he doesn't like Waze.

30:19.542 --> 30:22.416
He gets in the car.
Don't tell-- don't give him
any direction.

30:22.416 --> 30:24.000
He doesn't like
to be told things.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.250
"I know how to go.

30:25.250 --> 30:29.416
The Waze takes me to--
to El Mansour Boulevard

30:29.416 --> 30:31.542
and gives me a left turn
in rush hour.
No good."

30:31.542 --> 30:34.959
- You know.
- I feel like maybe I've been
in an Uber with the ayatollah,

30:34.959 --> 30:37.375
'cause I've heard
this very same dialogue.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.834
- That's possible.
Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.834
Do you know about
the ayatollah's life?

30:41.834 --> 30:43.959
Like, does he--
does he eat cereal?

30:43.959 --> 30:45.416
He loves granola.

30:45.416 --> 30:46.416
- He does?
- Yes.

30:52.416 --> 30:54.500
Well, well.
Look at you.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.959
You got here ahead of me.
I can't believe it.

30:56.959 --> 30:58.792
God damn right.
I'm doing my fucking
dizzle, baby.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.917
Jesus, you're--
you're workin'.

31:00.917 --> 31:04.000
Hey, that ayatollah bit
you did on "Kimmel"
was fucking great.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.375
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:05.375 --> 31:06.750
- You liked it?
- I fuckin' loved it.

31:06.750 --> 31:09.500
- Oh, good.
- ( phone ringing )

31:09.500 --> 31:11.625
Larry David's office.
What's up?

31:11.625 --> 31:13.792
- Jeff over phone:
Let me speak to Larry.
- It's Jeff.

31:13.792 --> 31:15.583
Okay, transfer it
to here.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.500
How?

31:18.667 --> 31:21.500
- I don't know.
- What's taking so long?
Get Larry!

31:21.500 --> 31:23.208
Hold on, Jeff.
Hold on.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.375
- Hey.
- Turn on the TV!

31:27.375 --> 31:29.000
- What channel?
- Every channel!

31:29.000 --> 31:30.667
Every goddamn channel!

31:30.667 --> 31:33.500
You're a complete
and total fuck-up.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.375
You're a total,
total fuck-up.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.834
Larry David,
who you may know as
the co-creator of "Seinfeld,"

31:38.834 --> 31:40.500
went on "Jimmy Kimmel Live"
last night

31:40.500 --> 31:43.625
to talk about his new
musical called "Fatwa!"

31:43.625 --> 31:47.166
in which the ayatollah
is one of the main characters.

31:47.166 --> 31:51.500
There's a small harem.
Uh, he has a fetish
for redheads.

31:51.500 --> 31:56.166
And twice a year,
he goes to Ireland
on a harem shopping spree.

31:56.166 --> 31:59.208
Today, the Ayatollah
Abdullah Kazemaini of Iran

31:59.208 --> 32:01.458
has accused Larry David
of blasphemy,

32:01.458 --> 32:05.458
issuing an actual fatwa
and calling for the death
of the comedian.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.917
Here's what
the ayatollah had to say.

32:07.917 --> 32:09.917
( speaking Persian )

32:09.917 --> 32:11.000
...Larry David.

32:13.458 --> 32:14.875
..."Seinfeld."

32:14.875 --> 32:16.792
- What the fuck?!
- "What the fuck" is right.

32:16.792 --> 32:18.625
Interpreter:
No one would dare insult

32:18.625 --> 32:19.875
the sacred beliefs
of Muslims,

32:19.875 --> 32:21.291
nor disparage our honor.

32:21.291 --> 32:23.125
I didn't disparage.
There was no disparage.

32:23.125 --> 32:25.458
- You did disparage.
- No, no. I didn't disparage!

32:25.458 --> 32:28.042
I begged you not to
imitate the ayatollah.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.625
- No, you didn't!
- I told Leon.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.625
I said you got to get
this message to him.

32:31.625 --> 32:34.208
Jeff told you to tell me
not to do the ayatollah?

32:34.208 --> 32:36.625
I didn't fucking remember.
How the fuck am I gonna
remember that shit?

32:36.625 --> 32:38.375
- ( both shouting )
- What the fuck is wrong
with you?!

32:38.375 --> 32:41.416
- I didn't know what the fuck--
- Oh, my God! What the fuck?!

32:41.416 --> 32:42.834
...Larry David!

32:42.834 --> 32:44.208
Interpreter:
So I call on valiant Muslims,

32:44.208 --> 32:45.542
wherever they may be,

32:45.542 --> 32:47.583
to kill Larry David
without delay.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.834
- What?!
- And whoever may die in
this cause will be a martyr.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.166
No! I'll repent!
I'll be punished!

32:52.166 --> 32:55.375
Even if Larry David repents,
he will be condemned to death.

32:55.375 --> 32:58.000
I'll-- I'll convert!
I'll become a Muslim!

32:58.000 --> 32:59.917
Even if Larry David
converts to Islam,

32:59.917 --> 33:01.875
he should still
be sent to hell.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.750
- ( shouts ) Jeff!
- You got a fucking fatwa!

33:04.750 --> 33:06.792
- I got a fatwa!
- You got fatwa'd!

33:06.792 --> 33:08.583
No!

33:08.583 --> 33:10.792
Agent:
Gentlemen, the FBI
takes this very seriously.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.333
But it's nothing
that you really need
to worry about.

33:13.333 --> 33:15.250
What the-- that's
so easy for you to say.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.500
I-- the ayatollah
mentioned my name.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.959
The fucking guy
was on television,
screaming my name.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.917
( imitates ayatollah )
Larry David!

33:22.917 --> 33:26.416
( imitating continues )
Larry David!

33:26.416 --> 33:27.959
I'm doing Spanish,
it sounds like.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.750
( imitates speaking Spanish )
Larry David!

33:29.750 --> 33:35.375
Quick question.
Um, what about friends
of people that have fatwas?

33:35.375 --> 33:36.750
Fatwa by association.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.084
What kind of
fucking question is that?

33:38.084 --> 33:39.458
- Do I associate with you?
- Yeah.

33:39.458 --> 33:41.708
Okay.
I wanna know what
my situation is.

33:41.708 --> 33:44.333
Fatwa by association.
What do you know about it?

33:44.333 --> 33:46.166
- You're fine as well.
- I am?

33:46.166 --> 33:49.834
- You're fine.
- Hey, I got an idea.

33:49.834 --> 33:53.125
I go on
the "Jimmy Kimmel" show
and I apologize.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.792
- I apologize to the ayatollah.
- You think I didn't
think of that?

33:55.792 --> 33:57.125
I've already talked
to the "Kimmel" show.

33:57.125 --> 33:58.625
They want nothing
to do with you.

33:58.625 --> 34:00.375
This whole thing's
falling apart.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.792
Every "Fatwa!" producer
has called me.

34:02.792 --> 34:03.959
This is all dead.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.667
( Larry whispers )
Hey.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.166
- It's me.
- Holy shit.

34:28.125 --> 34:30.834
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

34:30.834 --> 34:33.333
- I'm wearing a disguise.
- You think that's gonna help?

34:33.333 --> 34:35.416
Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt.
What am I supposed to do?

34:35.416 --> 34:37.500
Disguises have been employed
effectively in the past.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.667
Tyra Banks dressed up
as a fat person on her show

34:39.667 --> 34:41.000
to see what
it's like being fat.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.500
Needless to say,
it wasn't very pleasant.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.917
Have you ever seen
"Undercover Boss"?

34:43.917 --> 34:45.708
The guy goes undercover,
nobody even knows who he is.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.875
He's the boss
of the whole company.
He fools everybody.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.625
Well, you know
what the good news is?

34:49.625 --> 34:51.375
I'm still alive.

34:51.375 --> 34:52.500
You know what?

34:52.500 --> 34:54.084
That's not funny.

34:54.084 --> 34:55.542
- It's not funny.
- You know, you're a comedian.

34:55.542 --> 34:57.042
You should be able
to take a joke.

34:57.042 --> 34:58.959
What, you're comparing this
to your dead parakeet?

34:58.959 --> 35:00.834
- Nothing compares
to my dead parakeet.
- Yeah.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.333
Numa:
Larry David!

35:06.375 --> 35:08.208
- I know you're in here.
I saw your car.
- Holy shit.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.750
- Fatwa?
- ( whispers )
No, lesbian bride.

35:10.750 --> 35:14.667
Larry David?
Where the fuck
are you, Larry?

35:14.667 --> 35:17.208
Prepare to die,
baldy.

35:17.208 --> 35:20.416
I know you're in here, Larry!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

35:20.416 --> 35:22.291
And the next time
a door's ajar,

35:22.291 --> 35:24.375
maybe stay the fuck out!

35:26.708 --> 35:29.250
I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

35:29.250 --> 35:31.583
Larry fucking David!

35:31.583 --> 35:33.458
( water rushing )

35:59.750 --> 36:01.625
( door squeaks )

36:04.917 --> 36:06.583
Fatwa?!

36:06.583 --> 36:09.542
No, cocksucker.
Foisted!

36:09.542 --> 36:12.416
( theme music playing )

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I can't go back to the house.
I gotta move or sell the house.

37:26.000 --> 37:26.834
You can't sell the house.

37:27.166 --> 37:28.375
A lot of my ladies know
I live there already.

37:28.375 --> 37:29.834
You gonna set me back
two or three years.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.959
My nephew Kenny, the jewel
of the Funkhouser family tree.

37:34.959 --> 37:35.959
LARRY DAVID:
Is that so?

37:35.959 --> 37:38.375
High school
all-American pitcher.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.625
DAVID: Kid's a pitcher?

37:39.625 --> 37:41.125
Looks like he can't lift
a chess piece.

37:41.125 --> 37:42.792
I must tell you something,
Mr. David.

37:42.792 --> 37:46.000
The Ayatollah himself
is a bit of a close-talker.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.208
Oh, I wouldn't want to get
too close to that guy,

37:48.208 --> 37:49.333
to tell you the truth.

37:49.333 --> 37:50.542
It doesn't look like
he's popping Lifesavers

37:50.542 --> 37:51.834
in his mouth all day long.
