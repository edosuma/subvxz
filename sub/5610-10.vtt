OR MAYBE
I'VE JUST CHANGED MY MIND

38:29.380 --> 38:31.041
MAYBE I'M YOURS

38:31.050 --> 38:32.096
I'M YOURS

38:32.100 --> 38:33.977
I'M YOURS, I'M YOURS

38:33.980 --> 38:35.971
I'M YOURS, I'M YOURS

38:35.980 --> 38:37.186
I'M YOURS

38:37.190 --> 38:38.339
YES, SIR

38:45.490 --> 38:48.607
HEY.

38:48.610 --> 38:50.271
THANK YOU FOR WARNING ME.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.747
THERE'S NOTHING
LEI-T TO SAY.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.120
CALEB, I AM SO SORRY.

39:03.130 --> 39:05.507
I DIDN'T THINK THAT
IT WOULD END LIKE THIS.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.956
ARE YOU JUST
GONNA IGNORE ME?

39:07.960 --> 39:09.120
CALEB?

39:09.130 --> 39:11.212
WHAT?

39:11.220 --> 39:12.881
I DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS,
OKAY?

39:12.890 --> 39:15.131
YEAH, YOU DID,
WHEN YOU SLEPT WITH MY DAD.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.721
YOU DID CHOOSE THIS.

39:16.730 --> 39:19.221
WELL, IF WHATEVER I HAD
WITH YOUR DAD WAS ON THE RECORD,

39:19.230 --> 39:20.925
THEN ME ENDING IT IS, TOO.

39:20.930 --> 39:23.069
GOD, I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW YOUR MOM'S GONNA FEEL

39:23.070 --> 39:24.776
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.236
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT,

39:26.240 --> 39:28.140
'CAUSE SHE ALREADY KNOWS.

39:28.150 --> 39:30.471
YEAH, I TOLD HER, BECAUSE
SHE'S GONNA GET THE NOMINATION,

39:30.480 --> 39:31.868
AND I HAVE TO PROTECT HER.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.906
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY.

39:33.910 --> 39:35.400
YOU PROTECT THEM.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.204
Liam: HEY.

39:45.710 --> 39:47.666
YOU SHOULD GET
SOME REST.

39:47.670 --> 39:49.126
WHY?

39:49.130 --> 39:52.554
SO I CAN SLEEP BEFORE
MY SENTENCING TOMORROW?

39:52.560 --> 39:53.925
WE'RE BACK AT ZERO,

39:53.930 --> 39:57.058
AND I JUST LOST EVERYONE
THAT I TRUST THE MOST.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.459
WE'LL KEEP LOOKING.

39:58.470 --> 39:59.676
I'LL KEEP LOOKING.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.806
YOU HAVEN'T
LOST EVERYTHING, ALEX.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.605
YES, I HAVE.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.320
SIMON.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.082
TAILING ME YOURSELF NOW?

40:25.250 --> 40:27.707
I SENT THEM HOME.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.666
NO ONE'S HERE.

40:29.670 --> 40:30.796
JUST US.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.676
SO...

40:34.260 --> 40:35.807
YOU NEED MY HELP.

40:35.810 --> 40:38.210
I NEED YOU
TO BELIEVE IN ME

40:38.220 --> 40:40.848
LIKE I BELIEVED IN YOU

40:40.850 --> 40:42.647
WHEN NO ONE ELSE DID.

40:42.650 --> 40:44.140
WHEN EVERYONE LOOKED
RIGHT THROUGH YOU,

40:44.150 --> 40:46.391
I SAW YOU, SIMON.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.640
ALEX --

40:47.650 --> 40:51.142
NO, YOU WALKED THROUGH FIRE
FOR ME,

40:51.150 --> 40:55.234
AND I'M ASKING YOU
TO WALK RIGHT BACK IN.

40:55.240 --> 40:58.528
NOT BECAUSE IT'S FAIR
OR BECAUSE YOU OWE ME ANYTHING

40:58.530 --> 40:59.656
OR BECAUSE BY TOMORROW,

40:59.660 --> 41:02.128
I MIGHT BE IN JAIL
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

41:02.130 --> 41:04.416
BUT WE SAVE LIVES.

41:04.420 --> 41:07.127
WE CAN CATCH
THIS TERRORIST, SIMON.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.449
BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

41:08.460 --> 41:10.200
I NEED YOU.

41:10.210 --> 41:12.349
I'VE ALWAYS NEEDED YOU.

41:15.850 --> 41:18.045
I NEED US TO GO BACK
TO WHAT WE WERE AT QUANTICO.

41:18.050 --> 41:19.176
PLEASE.

41:19.180 --> 41:20.886
I WISH WE COULD.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.221
SIMON --

41:22.230 --> 41:24.642
I WISH WE COULD WIPE AWAY
THIS WHOLE YEAR --

41:24.650 --> 41:27.141
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE,
EVERYTHING WE HAVE LOST.

41:29.940 --> 41:32.773
I WISH WE COULD GO BACK TO BEING
THE OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE

41:32.780 --> 41:36.193
WHO SIGNED UP
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.906
BUT WE CAN'T,

41:37.910 --> 41:40.481
BECAUSE WE NEVER WERE
THOSE PEOPLE TO BEGIN WITH.

41:40.490 --> 41:44.745
AND WE CAN NEVER
GO BACK TO QUANTICO.
