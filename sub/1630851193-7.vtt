Aw.

You think I'm stupid?

21:33.596 --> 21:35.294
No, Ollie. You're not stupid.
I-If anything,

21:35.337 --> 21:37.165
I am
for making you feel that way.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.080
We're just opposites.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.822
I know
I should be more like you.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.998
I disagree.
I should be more like you.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.608
More in the moment.

21:45.652 --> 21:48.611
We should eat some marshmallows
in the present,

21:48.655 --> 21:50.309
and we can save some for later.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.572
It's all about balance, right?

21:52.615 --> 21:57.141
Oh, that is good advice, Toddie.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.884
And you know what? I'm gonna try
not to be so "all or none."

22:00.928 --> 22:04.758
I'm gonna try to collaborate
and work well with others. Huh?

22:04.801 --> 22:07.238
Starting right now.
Because we got a lawsuit,

22:07.282 --> 22:09.197
and thanks to me, we got
to find a way to break even.
