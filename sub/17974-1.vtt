communication device,

is that your life is in danger.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.782

00:16.784 --> 00:18.317

00:21.989 --> 00:23.522

00:23.524 --> 00:24.790

01:30.391 --> 01:32.191
This is sports gear.
It's necessary.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.860
Got to cheer on
my Stoolbend Steamers

01:34.862 --> 01:37.362

Goochland Glorioles.

01:37.364 --> 01:40.199
Cleveland, I was just
explaining to Roberta

01:40.201 --> 01:42.868
that we're cutting back
right now, and that's why

01:42.870 --> 01:45.571
she has to return
that slutty Halloween costume.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.872
All right.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.708
Roberta, you must
return that costume.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.709
Ugh!

01:50.711 --> 01:52.111
(Roberta crying)

01:52.113 --> 01:53.912

01:53.914 --> 01:55.747
Yeah, but no
more than usual.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.883
Ah, good, 'cause I'm
going to drink the rest

01:57.885 --> 01:58.917
of our money at the game.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.752
I'm going to liquidate it.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.920
Get it?
Yes.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.889
Drinky, drinky, wee-wee?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.724
Cleveland, you can't
drink this year.
Come again?

02:05.726 --> 02:08.060
You and the guys alternate
being the designated driver,

02:08.062 --> 02:10.062
and this year is your turn.

02:10.064 --> 02:11.897
The designated driver?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.065
No!

02:13.067 --> 02:16.135
(eerie music plays)

02:19.072 --> 02:23.909
I spend 364 days a year
dressed like a damn nun,

to show a little skin,

02:26.080 --> 02:28.280
my dumb old parents
won't let me.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.916
Do you want your Federline
to talk to your step-pops

02:30.918 --> 02:31.917
and make things right?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.919
He hates you.
What?

02:33.921 --> 02:36.922
But I gots to be tight with
my possible step-pops-in-law.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.991
Maybe he just don't
know me well enough.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.926
He's about to get Feducated.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.662
See, that's the
stuff he hates.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.963
Yes, I'm trying to locate

02:44.965 --> 02:47.499
Toonces, the Cat
Who Could Drive a Car?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.600
What?

02:48.602 --> 02:49.801
But how'd he die?

02:49.803 --> 02:51.837
Feline leukemia?

02:51.839 --> 02:52.838
Well, that's not funny.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.940
Oh, it's no use.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.942
I've tried one thing
I can think of

02:56.944 --> 02:58.844
to find a
designated driver.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.112
I'm screwed.

03:00.114 --> 03:02.014
What's up, Mr. C?
Shut up.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.950
Come on, I think
yous and mes should get

03:04.952 --> 03:06.118

03:06.120 --> 03:07.786

03:07.788 --> 03:10.656
I'll be busy being sober
at a football game

03:10.658 --> 03:13.025
unless I can find
some jackass to drive me.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.193
Wait.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.628
There's a jackass
right here.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.632
Federline, congratulations,
you're our designated driver.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.434
Blap yeah.
(groans)

03:24.971 --> 03:28.840
Thanks for making it so we
can't have costumes, Roberta.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.175
You ruined Halloween.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.144
It's my mom
and Cleveland's fault.

03:32.146 --> 03:34.980
They're the ones who said we
can't buy costumes this year.

03:34.982 --> 03:35.981
Except for me,

03:35.983 --> 03:39.151
'cause I'm so cute.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.325
Look, I'm still going out
this Halloween.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.827
And since I can't go
as someone sexy,

03:48.829 --> 03:52.998
I'm going to dress up as
the least sexy thing possible.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.200
This is how I'm getting
back at my mom.

03:55.202 --> 03:58.003
You're going to have sex
with my dad.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.839
No, I'm going as my mom.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.174
And you should go
as Cleveland.

04:02.176 --> 04:05.077

at my breasts.

planning your pranks.

I'll just... I'll just sit
over here and bleed out.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.200

you'd sell this costume

04:28.202 --> 04:30.235
to a 15-year-old girl.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.070
We want a full refund.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.872

thought I'd let her

04:41.548 --> 04:43.548

looking like this?

04:43.550 --> 04:45.450
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.744
Oh, my God, Lil Wayne!

09:39.746 --> 09:41.012
Hey, yo, Weezy.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.915
Federline Jones
from Stoolbend.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.183
I sent you my demo.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.519
Federline, even I know
that's not Lil Wayne,

09:47.521 --> 09:49.854
and I don't know
who Lil Wayne is.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.924
This my dog, Cleveland
Brown from Stoolbend.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.527
Lester Krinklesac,
also from Stoolbend.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.596
And Tim the Bear...
oh, you know what?

09:57.598 --> 09:59.197
My whole posse
from Stoolbend.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.033
Did somebody say
"Stoolbend" four times?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.868
Get 'em!

10:03.870 --> 10:05.403
Smurf my (bleep).

10:05.405 --> 10:08.206
Let's get the (bleep)
out of smurf, buttsmurfers.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.507
Am I doing it right?

10:11.577 --> 10:14.012
Aah!

10:17.883 --> 10:19.117
(all coughing)

10:19.119 --> 10:22.621
No, that's the last bus!

10:22.623 --> 10:24.389
Ever?
In the world?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.558
No. Shut up, Federline.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.393
Quick, through these vines.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.562
Are these wine grapes?

10:30.564 --> 10:32.397
Oh, this is a vineyard.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.299
Wow, Goochland really is nice.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.405
Where the hell
is Cleveland?

10:40.407 --> 10:41.773
Lady hot.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.807
Drink.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.810
(giggles)
Why, thank you.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.579
(howls)

10:47.581 --> 10:52.250
Even the guy dressed as an
Armenian woman thinks I'm hot.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.985
How about you, Officer?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.920
You looking
for some action, too?

10:55.922 --> 10:56.921
Maybe I am.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.623
Trick or treat?

10:58.625 --> 11:00.425
I'm the sweetest treat
on the street.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.961
Guess that makes you
the trick.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.996
If you're willing to pay.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.931
(laughs)

11:06.933 --> 11:08.767
You're under arrest
for prostitution.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.468
Really?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.470
(Roberta laughs)

11:12.472 --> 11:14.005
Oh, man, they're going to be

11:14.007 --> 11:16.608
pulling these out
the field all day.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.810
Now, make sure the
security camera sees us

11:18.812 --> 11:20.812
so my mom and your
dad get in trouble.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.913
Okay.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.952
Come on, let's go kill a horse
in the principal's office.

11:27.954 --> 11:31.790
WALLY (over P.A.):
This is Principal Wally Farquhar
from the security camera room.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.958
Remove those toothpicks.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.327
The field
is not an hors d'oeuvre.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.797
So, Donna and Cleveland, Senior,

11:38.799 --> 11:40.865
I'm coming after you!

11:42.802 --> 11:44.803
WALLY (over P.A.):
Uh-oh, the door's locked.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.972
Are there any locksmiths
within earshot?

11:47.974 --> 11:51.543
Well, I guess I'll just count
toothpicks to pass the time.

11:51.545 --> 11:56.414
One-a-rooney, two-a-rooney,
three-a-reeney, four.

11:58.684 --> 12:02.487
Oh, man, them punks is lucky we
got scared and took off running.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.990
If we'd stayed, I would've
hit 'em with a blap and a blap

12:05.992 --> 12:08.893
and a flip-flip-patty-whap-
rat-a-tat-tat.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.862
I'm the Cat in the Hat.
Enough!

12:10.864 --> 12:12.330
You're not a gangster.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.499
You're a sheltered kid
from the suburbs.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.569
You've never done anything
badass in your life.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.404
Whitchy, whitchy,
whitchy, what?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.839
You blappin' me.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.707
"Blapping?"
That's not even a word.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.042
You're an idiot.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.845
You were our designated driver
and that's it.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.513
Wow, this hurts.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.681
Holt?

12:29.683 --> 12:31.049
Lester?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.717
Even you, T.T. Bear?

12:32.719 --> 12:33.885
(gulps)

12:33.887 --> 12:35.987
A'ight, then. I'm out!

12:37.857 --> 12:39.724
Let him go.
No one's trying to stop him.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.793
(train whistle blows)

12:44.897 --> 12:47.966
Guys, let's hop the train home!

12:49.268 --> 12:50.935
CLEVELAND:
Okay. Okay.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.771
Here we go.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.938
No.

12:53.940 --> 12:58.710
No. No.

12:58.712 --> 12:59.711
Now!

12:59.713 --> 13:01.212
(grunting)

13:01.214 --> 13:03.748
(all groaning)
CLEVELAND:
Ew! Ow! Ew! Ow!

13:03.750 --> 13:06.284
CLEVELAND:
<i>Tim, stop eating the diapers.</i>

13:07.219 --> 13:09.087
RALLO:
Hello?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.389
Anybody home?

13:11.391 --> 13:15.059
Again, I have
cut myself pretty badly.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.928
Little help?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.898
Feeling weak.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.033
Maybe I'll just take a nap.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.135
Aah!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.804
This is all a mistake.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.238
It's just a costume.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.606
So is mine.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.575
Yeah, I'm Whitney Cummings.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.944
(coughing)

13:32.946 --> 13:34.979
I don't belong here!

13:34.981 --> 13:37.115
Sure you don't, sister.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.984
I can't believe someone her
age is still in the game.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.053
Hey, she's somebody's
grandmother.

13:46.992 --> 13:47.926
(sighs deeply)

13:47.928 --> 13:49.160
Back home.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.995
Yep, safe at last.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.998
Now off to the beautiful motel
to meet my cheap wife.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.168
I mean, to the cheap motel
to meet my cheap wife.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.438
FEDERLINE:
Yo, special delivery from Fed X!

14:00.440 --> 14:03.141
Who's a gangsta now?

14:03.143 --> 14:06.845
Federline, what are you talking
ab... bah-bah-bah-bah-bah!

14:06.847 --> 14:07.946
(swallows)

14:07.948 --> 14:08.980
That's right.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.481
Still think I'm not a badass?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.617
I done stole they Wood-ass Wife!

14:12.619 --> 14:13.952
Ooh-ooh!

14:13.954 --> 14:15.954
Oh, my God.
Did anyone see you?

14:15.956 --> 14:16.955
No way!

14:16.957 --> 14:18.990
I'm <i>Stealth</i> like Jamie Foxx.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.358
Remember that terrible movie?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.127
Nobody saw it, nobody saw me!

14:23.129 --> 14:25.096
(low rumble)

14:27.466 --> 14:29.567
(shouting)

14:31.971 --> 14:34.205
(neighs)

14:34.207 --> 14:37.809
Let's pray they go for
the women and children first.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.711
Dear Tim Tebow.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.714
Please have them kill
the women and children first.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.048
Amen on three.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.383
One, two, three...
ALL:
Amen!

14:48.654 --> 14:49.854
(shouting, laughing)

14:49.856 --> 14:52.156
Well, they're
ransacking the town.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.325
And they're looting our stores.
(glass breaking)

14:54.327 --> 14:56.194
Nope, nope, they're realizing
it's all crap

14:56.196 --> 14:57.896
and putting it back
on the shelves.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.697
This is all
Federline's fault!

14:59.699 --> 15:00.999
Yeah!
That's right!
Yeah!

15:01.001 --> 15:02.867
Look, maybe they'll
leave us alone

15:02.869 --> 15:04.836
if we give them back
their Wooden Wife.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.738
And maybe one of ours's.

15:06.740 --> 15:07.872
ALL:
Take mine!

15:07.874 --> 15:09.574
Ha, ha, marriage.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.844
As funny as that is,
why would you give back

15:12.846 --> 15:15.013
something that is
rightfully ours?

15:15.015 --> 15:17.015
Quick, barkeep,
what knowest thou?

15:17.017 --> 15:19.017
The Wooden Wife
belongs to Stoolbend.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.852
(crowd exclaiming)

15:20.854 --> 15:23.021
Goochland borrowed it
from us for the

15:23.023 --> 15:26.724
ought-three World's Fair
and never returned it.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.426
Gus, how did you know this?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.696
I am 117 years old.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.964
CLEVELAND:
Wow.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.201
Stoolbend...

15:37.203 --> 15:40.271
come out and play...

15:40.273 --> 15:41.873
There's only one thing to do.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.876
Give the Wooden Wife back
and grovel for our lives.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.444
Yeah, beg for mercy!

15:46.446 --> 15:47.578
Get the hell
out of town!

15:47.580 --> 15:48.880
Intern the Japanese!

15:48.882 --> 15:50.548
Yo, no way!

15:50.550 --> 15:52.283
This our birch bitch,

15:52.285 --> 15:54.886
and we ain't givin' her up
without a tussle, yo!

15:54.888 --> 15:57.722
If we do, we just
the punks they say we is.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.390
Don't listen
to the ass-brain.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.259
He'll get us all
killed to death.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.393
(crowd shouting)

16:02.395 --> 16:03.394
CLEVELAND:
No!

16:03.396 --> 16:06.130
The ass-brain is right.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.135
(music plays)

16:11.137 --> 16:12.904
Listen up, people of Stoolbend.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.939
We've got to stand up
to Goochland.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.910
Sure, they may have better
restaurants and better schools

16:18.912 --> 16:21.112
and better infrastructure
and better people,

16:21.114 --> 16:23.982
but we have nothing.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.251
I say to you,
fellow Stoolbendipudlians,

16:27.253 --> 16:30.121
I hope we all die today!

16:30.123 --> 16:32.924
Die... for...

16:32.926 --> 16:34.759
nothing!

16:34.761 --> 16:36.094
Cleveland's right!

16:36.096 --> 16:37.328
I'd like that
on Facebook.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.997
Intern the Japanese!

16:38.999 --> 16:40.932
We might be at a disadvantage,

16:40.934 --> 16:42.934
but you know what you get
when you rearrange

16:42.936 --> 16:44.435
the letters in "disadvantage?"

16:44.437 --> 16:47.105
You get "Advantage, Sid."

16:47.107 --> 16:49.774
Well, today we are Sid,

16:49.776 --> 16:52.110
and we've got the advantage!

16:52.112 --> 16:53.111
MAN:
What?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.013
Stoolbend's a mess.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.948
And we're going to make
the most of the fact

16:56.950 --> 16:59.450
that it's rotting away
beneath our feet.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.618
Who's with me?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.954
I am!

17:02.956 --> 17:04.288
He got it.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.291
Put a cone over that
hole and let's go!

17:07.293 --> 17:09.994
(cheering)

17:09.996 --> 17:11.763
Cone.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.532
After our night
of mischief,

17:14.534 --> 17:17.168
my dad and your mom
are gonna find themselves

17:17.170 --> 17:19.003
in a whole heap of...

17:19.005 --> 17:21.806
(shouting)

17:21.808 --> 17:23.141
Oh, my God.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.976
Junior, what did you do?
What?

17:24.978 --> 17:26.978
Hey, it was your idea.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.046
You're a filthy liar!

17:28.048 --> 17:31.115
Now we look and sound
like our parents.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.318
(horse neighs)

17:34.320 --> 17:35.987
What do we want?

17:35.989 --> 17:39.323
To kill the black guy,
but not because he's black!

17:39.325 --> 17:41.059
CLEVELAND:
Chet Butler!

17:43.695 --> 17:45.329
Cleveland!

17:45.331 --> 17:47.832
Return Goochland's Wooden Wife

17:47.834 --> 17:50.001
and we might let you live.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.236
You want her, come get her.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.905
Very well, then.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.040
Goochland, attack!

17:56.042 --> 17:57.241
(yelling)

18:02.181 --> 18:03.181
What the...?

18:03.183 --> 18:04.882
Rolling blackouts!

18:04.884 --> 18:07.018
This happens
all the time in Stoolbend.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.586
We're so used to
the darkness,

18:08.588 --> 18:11.155
we've developed mole eyes.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.429
(screams)

18:19.264 --> 18:22.200
(yelling)

18:22.202 --> 18:24.268
(screaming)

18:25.704 --> 18:28.473
They're going to eat them.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.610
(cheering)

18:33.712 --> 18:36.247
I've been given
a second chance.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.750
I'm going to DeVry
to get my advanced degree.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.419
In whoring.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.922
Ooh, we just
rolled into a rumble.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.190
Goochlanders?

18:48.627 --> 18:49.927
Ooh, we got a jumper.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.028
I'ma leave it.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.132
BOTH:
Is that what I look like?

18:59.738 --> 19:02.073
Yo, thanks for standing up
for me back at the bar

19:02.075 --> 19:04.242
when everybody
called me a ass-brain.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.077
You earned it, ass-brain.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.979
You showed bravery today.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.248
And you have pride
in your town.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.984
Just like every
dumb hockey fan.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.152
Federline?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.419
Blap.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.121
Big preesh, C-Beezy.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.256
CHET BUTLER:
There he is!

19:18.258 --> 19:20.324
On the other side
of the river!

19:20.326 --> 19:22.160
How'd I get over there?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.261
Wait, that's Junior!

19:23.263 --> 19:24.996
Hey, Chet!

19:27.266 --> 19:29.600
What? Two Clevelands?

19:29.602 --> 19:32.470
Remember our polluted waterways?

19:32.472 --> 19:36.807
Well, welcome to the
Bridge on the River... Die!

19:36.809 --> 19:38.242
(screaming)

19:44.149 --> 19:46.117
How did you find my throat?

19:46.119 --> 19:48.653
Nice try, Cleveland,
but you missed me.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.354
I wasn't trying to get you.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.423
I was trying to wake it up.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.496
We have no idea
what that is.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.864
(roars)

19:59.866 --> 20:01.365
No! No!

20:06.471 --> 20:09.140
You okay, Junior?
Yeah.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.142
But how am I
gonna get across?

20:11.144 --> 20:12.710
I'm gonna show you.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.712
Rat bridge!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.747
(squeaking)

20:32.197 --> 20:34.065
Hey there, baby.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.401
Give you 100 bucks to get
freaky at the Travelodge.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.904
Sounds good to me,
handsome... Cleveland!

20:39.906 --> 20:41.205
Donna!

20:41.207 --> 20:43.307
Role-playing.
Yep, role-playing.

20:45.844 --> 20:49.747
By the time I'm done with you,
you're gonna be a canoe.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.685
Hi. I died.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.755
Ha, ha, just kidding.
I'll see y'all next week.
