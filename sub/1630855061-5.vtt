19:30.471 --> 19:33.071
What do you mean?
I don't know.

19:33.073 --> 19:36.475
No, you're right,
it's not our faults.

19:36.477 --> 19:40.479
I'll tell you whose fault it
is -- multi-level marketing!

19:40.481 --> 19:42.815
Yeah, they lure you in
with big promises

19:42.817 --> 19:46.351
and self-improvement jargon,
and then they suck you dry.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.552
Who sucks you dry?

19:47.554 --> 19:49.021
They prey on suckers!

19:49.023 --> 19:50.288
Like us.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.824
And the only way to get
out of it

19:51.826 --> 19:54.626
is to find
an even bigger sucker.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.766
Ding-dang! 80% margins?
I feel like a thief!

20:01.768 --> 20:04.769
Now you sure you want to sell me
all these gorgeous leggings?

20:04.771 --> 20:06.438
I mean, they're gorgeous!

20:06.440 --> 20:07.439
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

20:07.441 --> 20:08.773
Yep.
Yes.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.042
-Definitely.
-Please take them.

20:10.044 --> 20:12.310
Money's been tight lately.
Ma moved in.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.512
She's sick.

20:13.514 --> 20:14.847
The medical bills
are crippling what with

20:14.849 --> 20:17.049
the dialysis every day.
Don't ask.

20:17.051 --> 20:19.651
But with this new
revenue stream,

20:19.653 --> 20:21.887
our prayers
have been answered!

20:25.259 --> 20:27.526
God, I'm so happy
I could sing!

20:27.528 --> 20:29.728
♪ It's goin' down ♪

20:29.730 --> 20:31.930
♪ I'm yellin' timber! ♪

20:34.201 --> 20:36.535
I'd like to propose a toast.

20:36.537 --> 20:38.871
Thanks for letting me
order the "sal-man."

20:38.873 --> 20:42.441
Not really a toast,
but I'll drink to it.

20:47.548 --> 20:49.681
Here. Have half
my sandwich.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.149
Thanks, Babe.

20:51.151 --> 20:55.353
You know, I guess I have made
one really good decision.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.755
My wife!

20:56.757 --> 20:58.223
Aww.

20:58.225 --> 21:00.125
Have a great night!
