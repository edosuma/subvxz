00:00.484 --> 00:01.664
Here come the fireworks!

00:01.730 --> 00:03.246
<i>Previously, on</i>
"SWAT"...

00:03.808 --> 00:05.285
She hate him deep.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.410
She's got her reasons, D.

00:06.498 --> 00:08.426
You ditched Mom, Wendy and me,
and you never came back!

00:08.513 --> 00:09.775
I didn't do right by you.

00:09.863 --> 00:11.681
You might want to think
about mending fences

00:11.769 --> 00:12.911
and owning up
to your mistakes.

00:12.998 --> 00:15.392
And I'm talking about
really owning up to them.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.004
To Mom.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.785
Street's brother.

00:25.910 --> 00:27.024
Foster brother.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.832
- Nate Warren.
- The reason I'm here

00:28.920 --> 00:30.175
is I need your help.

00:30.263 --> 00:31.558
You owe me one.

00:34.180 --> 00:35.886
I had to hit four places

00:36.167 --> 00:38.183
just to find
Mama Joan's favorites.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.212
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

00:41.644 --> 00:42.996
This means a lot.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.379
It means a lot
having you back in my life.

00:46.496 --> 00:47.629
Paying respects
to the woman

00:47.717 --> 00:49.394
who brought us together
only seems right.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.574
The best foster mom
I've ever had.

00:52.671 --> 00:54.972
She'd be so proud of you,
Streeter.

00:55.535 --> 00:57.293
LAPD...

00:57.446 --> 00:58.675
SWAT.

00:59.855 --> 01:00.928
Who
would've thought?

01:01.015 --> 01:02.574
She'd be proud of you, too,
man.

01:02.877 --> 01:04.452
Steady job,
paying your bills.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.613
You're killing it.

01:05.802 --> 01:07.918
Nah, the truth is

01:08.006 --> 01:10.019
work ain't so good
these days.

01:11.315 --> 01:12.765
I'm in some trouble, man.

01:13.215 --> 01:15.144
Last week,
after I closed the bar,

01:15.232 --> 01:16.621
two guys bust in.

01:16.845 --> 01:18.717
Ski masks and guns.

01:18.805 --> 01:21.019
We've been robbed before,
but this was different.

01:21.107 --> 01:22.309
And they weren't
looking for cash.

01:22.396 --> 01:23.527
What were they
looking for?

01:23.615 --> 01:24.616
Heroin.

01:24.979 --> 01:26.113
My boss, Nolan?

01:26.201 --> 01:28.035
He's into some
shady business.

01:28.123 --> 01:29.191
And I guess he uses

01:29.279 --> 01:30.754
the bar for a stash house.

01:30.910 --> 01:32.568
Somehow the guys
knew about it,

01:32.655 --> 01:34.020
and grabbed the drugs
from the back room.

01:34.107 --> 01:36.048
So your boss gets ripped off,
why is that your problem?

01:36.135 --> 01:38.386
Because he blames me
for the lost product.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.644
50 grand.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.734
He says I must've been in
on the job.

01:41.898 --> 01:43.456
- Were you in on it?
- What?!

01:43.544 --> 01:45.082
- No!
- I'm sorry.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.761
Listen, I still got some
cop buddies in Long Beach.

01:47.849 --> 01:49.498
I'll make some calls.
With you as a witness,

01:49.585 --> 01:51.065
- we'll put this Nolan guy away.
- No!

01:51.152 --> 01:53.504
Hell no! Look,
Nolan's connected.

01:53.677 --> 01:55.837
You'll find me in a gutter
before he's even arraigned.

01:55.925 --> 01:57.114
Well, then, what
do you want me to do?

01:57.201 --> 01:58.300
I don't know.

01:58.823 --> 02:00.215
Maybe you should talk to him.

02:00.303 --> 02:02.433
Tell him you know all
about his operation,

02:02.556 --> 02:04.925
and you'll turn a blind
eye if he lets me walk.

02:05.013 --> 02:07.527
Do you have any idea
how illegal that is?

02:08.401 --> 02:11.564
Do you remember the blood oath
that we had as kids, man?

02:12.011 --> 02:14.066
I'm in some serious
trouble, brother.

02:14.203 --> 02:17.636
So, please...
can you help me?

02:20.614 --> 02:21.716
I was too selfish

02:21.804 --> 02:23.793
to deserve you
and the family we had made.

02:23.881 --> 02:25.855
Did you practice
saying all this?

02:25.943 --> 02:28.636
Yes, I did, and a whole lot
of other ways to apologize.

02:28.723 --> 02:30.386
For running off
with some other woman?

02:30.474 --> 02:31.490
For leaving me

02:31.578 --> 02:32.925
and our children behind?

02:33.013 --> 02:35.597
You all deserved so
much better from me.

02:36.307 --> 02:37.331
I'm sorry.

02:37.419 --> 02:38.471
You're sorry?!

02:38.559 --> 02:39.605
You're sorry now?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.529
Why makes you think
I believe you now?

02:41.617 --> 02:43.269
I'm not asking you
to forgive me.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.879
I can't go back
and fix the past.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.668
I'm just
asking you to see...

02:47.756 --> 02:48.777
Daniel, stop!

02:48.865 --> 02:50.207
- Daniel, stop!
- Mom, Pop!

02:50.295 --> 02:52.465
Pop, that's enough,
Pop!

02:53.766 --> 02:55.395
It's all right, baby.

02:55.483 --> 02:56.582
It's okay.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.324
I was just getting
ready to leave.

02:58.777 --> 03:01.066
I left your food
on the stove.

03:01.201 --> 03:02.507
Mama, what's going on?

03:02.595 --> 03:05.316
Baby, I'm really okay.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:14.074 --> 03:15.722
Okay, real talk...
Why was my mama crying?

03:15.810 --> 03:18.728
You asked me
to mend fences.

03:18.816 --> 03:20.681
- Your words!
- I told you to mend fences,

03:20.769 --> 03:23.363
- not upset her!
- Life is complicated, son.

03:24.168 --> 03:26.488
Well, let me make it
real simple for you.

03:26.742 --> 03:28.121
I ain't about to let you break

03:28.209 --> 03:29.863
my mother's heart
all over again.

03:30.221 --> 03:32.056
Am I ever gonna
be able to do

03:32.144 --> 03:33.840
anything right in your eyes?

03:37.579 --> 03:38.925
Never mind.

03:43.402 --> 03:44.567
Did you get her to sleep?

03:44.655 --> 03:46.457
Yeah, finally.

03:47.201 --> 03:49.230
She's having
the same nightmares again.

03:54.132 --> 03:55.386
All right, I'll, uh,

03:55.516 --> 03:57.300
I'll talk
to her teacher tomorrow.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.152
See if there's something
going on at school.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.730
Oh, come on, David.

04:00.818 --> 04:02.472
We both know
it's not the school.

04:03.879 --> 04:05.254
I'm not blaming you,
I just...

04:05.342 --> 04:06.605
ever since our house
got shot up...

04:06.692 --> 04:08.105
What are we
supposed to do?

04:09.819 --> 04:12.519
I booked a session
tomorrow with Dr. Collins.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.258
For all of us.

04:14.784 --> 04:17.065
I know you don't like
the idea of therapy,

04:17.154 --> 04:19.180
but our kids need
to talk through this.

04:19.608 --> 04:21.430
And we need
to be there for them.

04:24.072 --> 04:25.220
All right.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.306
I'm on call tomorrow,

04:27.394 --> 04:28.970
but hopefully
it'll quiet, so...

04:30.269 --> 04:31.357
Hey.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.830
Huh?

04:34.617 --> 04:35.923
We'll get
through this.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.674
- El Monte?
- Yes.

04:53.932 --> 04:54.969
"Taifa."

04:55.065 --> 04:56.518
That a Somali name?

04:56.852 --> 04:57.953
Yes, sir.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.600
Oh, righteous.
My, uh,

04:59.688 --> 05:01.221
my wife's
from Somalia.

05:01.353 --> 05:02.500
Charge your phone?

05:02.588 --> 05:03.866
Yeah, thanks.

05:04.307 --> 05:06.031
Yeah, she, um,
she was born there,

05:06.119 --> 05:07.522
but she left
when she was a baby.

05:07.609 --> 05:08.929
Civil war and all that.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.361
Her parents
say it was brutal.

05:10.503 --> 05:12.515
We all have
different lives now.

05:12.736 --> 05:14.494
Amen to that.

05:15.432 --> 05:17.259
Have we crossed paths
at a barbeque or something?

05:17.346 --> 05:19.010
I feel like I've seen your face.

05:19.142 --> 05:20.404
I doubt it.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.266
I don't get out much.

05:33.408 --> 05:34.547
Uh, you know what?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.242
Change of plans.
You can, uh,

05:36.330 --> 05:38.446
you can actually just
let me out right here.

05:38.534 --> 05:40.401
Get some bad news
on your phone?

05:40.489 --> 05:42.031
Yeah, just a text.

05:42.119 --> 05:44.221
But, seriously,
anywhere here is good.

05:46.098 --> 05:47.588
Hey, what're you doing?
Stop.

05:47.922 --> 05:49.097
Stop.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.969
Looking at a barricade situation
in a corner deli.

06:27.057 --> 06:29.233
Two men, one of 'em armed,
holding the other hostage.

06:29.321 --> 06:31.111
Let's get 'em both out alive.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.695
Man, Luca makes driving this
thing look easier than it is.

06:36.807 --> 06:38.169
Yeah, well,
Black Betty's a load.

06:38.257 --> 06:39.329
You put a dent in her, Tan,

06:39.416 --> 06:41.302
- Luca's gonna have your ass.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:41.390 --> 06:42.618
What's the latest
with Luca, anyway?

06:42.705 --> 06:44.461
Anything new from
his doctors?

06:45.562 --> 06:47.274
Street! You with us?

06:47.361 --> 06:50.304
Yeah, sorry.
He's basically going stir crazy,

06:50.392 --> 06:52.157
but the doctor says he's got
to stay off the hip

06:52.244 --> 06:54.053
for a few more weeks while
they try this new therapy.

06:54.140 --> 06:55.381
We'll get him back
to beast mode.

06:55.468 --> 06:56.665
But for today,
we're one man down,

06:56.752 --> 06:58.164
so stay sharp.

07:00.895 --> 07:02.742
Hey. What's going on?

07:02.859 --> 07:05.328
I'm just thinking
about some family stuff.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.586
This is the LAPD!

07:20.674 --> 07:22.539
Come out
with your hands up!

07:29.493 --> 07:31.070
Drop the gun!
Do it now!

07:31.158 --> 07:32.571
No, no, no, no. It's okay.
I'm the good guy.

07:32.658 --> 07:34.791
I said drop the gun now!
I got a shot, boss.

07:34.907 --> 07:36.309
- He's a crazy man!
- This guy's a monster!

07:36.396 --> 07:37.530
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

07:37.617 --> 07:38.336
He's the one you want!

07:38.424 --> 07:40.234
Drop the gun or we will shoot!

07:43.644 --> 07:44.993
O-Okay.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.029
All right.

07:48.367 --> 07:49.859
Move! Move!

07:51.179 --> 07:52.959
Hands behind your head.
Behind your head.

07:53.047 --> 07:54.193
This is 20-David to command.

07:54.281 --> 07:56.271
Code 4.
Suspects in custody.

07:56.359 --> 07:58.599
He's crazy. He attacked
me in my own car.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.435
You pulled the gun.
It's his. Th-This is Aden Syed.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.312
Aden Syed, okay?
He's a monster.

08:08.437 --> 08:10.851
We're gonna take you both in
and sort this out.

08:21.262 --> 08:22.568
Photo's pretty old.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.461
Could be the guy
we brought in.

08:24.819 --> 08:26.086
I don't know, maybe.

08:26.174 --> 08:28.562
A lot more than maybe.
Fingerprints came back.

08:28.664 --> 08:30.246
That warlord on the screen?

08:30.333 --> 08:32.804
Same man sitting
in holding, Aden Syed.

08:32.892 --> 08:34.289
There's an Interpol
Red Notice out on him.

08:34.376 --> 08:35.990
Red Notice?
Issued by who?

08:36.078 --> 08:37.265
International Criminal Court.

08:37.352 --> 08:38.794
- This guy's wanted by the Hague?
- Mm-hmm.

08:38.881 --> 08:40.299
So he's pretty
straight-up evil.

08:40.405 --> 08:42.365
Hondo, you served in
Somalia back then.

08:42.453 --> 08:44.434
- What do you know about him?
- Syed was responsible

08:44.521 --> 08:46.685
for murdering thousands
during the civil war,

08:46.773 --> 08:48.547
and enslaving
children as soldiers.

08:48.656 --> 08:49.918
They called him
the "Saw Man"

08:50.005 --> 08:51.615
for the way
he would cut body parts off

08:51.702 --> 08:53.132
anyone who resisted him.

09:01.390 --> 09:02.680
Oh, you've been gone
for a minute.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.031
Thought maybe we'd seen
the last of you.

09:04.118 --> 09:05.523
Oh, sorry to disappoint.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.734
I was working a special project
for the mayor.

09:07.929 --> 09:11.125
This is Fabrice Vachel from the
International Criminal Court.

09:11.254 --> 09:13.976
And Agents Lufkin and Sampath.

09:14.377 --> 09:16.414
ICC's been going after Syed
for a while.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.947
We almost had Syed 25 years ago,
but he slipped away in Somalia.

09:20.035 --> 09:21.882
We're not taking
any chances this time.

09:21.970 --> 09:24.865
They'll be assuming custody of
Mr. Syed until his extradition.

09:24.953 --> 09:26.788
Well, happy to get him off
our hands, trust me.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.625
The news is already out
about his arrest,

09:28.713 --> 09:30.454
so sooner's better
for both of us.

09:41.854 --> 09:44.570
You ever cross paths with Syed
when you were in Somalia?

09:45.664 --> 09:47.320
Not face-to-face.

09:47.976 --> 09:50.007
But I saw plenty
of his handiwork.

10:08.043 --> 10:10.123
- What the hell was that?
- Shots. We're taking fire.

10:10.723 --> 10:12.870
This is Agent Lufkin. Mayday!
We're taking fire out here!

10:12.957 --> 10:14.942
Back up, back up, back up!

10:19.012 --> 10:20.208
Get to the gate!

10:20.342 --> 10:21.864
Cover left!

Vandelli's team did a sweep
of the area,

11:07.233 --> 11:08.633
but there's no sign
of the shooters.

11:08.854 --> 11:10.274
We've got an air unit
up and searching,

11:10.361 --> 11:11.336
but my guess is
they're long gone.

11:11.424 --> 11:13.109
But not necessarily
for good.

11:13.197 --> 11:14.797
Syed left behind widows

11:14.885 --> 11:16.437
and orphans
that moved to the U.S.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.211
Most of the Somali community
would love to see him dead.

11:19.299 --> 11:20.602
Since he's
such a hot target,

11:20.690 --> 11:22.609
what do you say we let SWAT
handle the transport

11:22.704 --> 11:24.384
and provide security
at your safe house?

11:24.479 --> 11:26.360
We've got the gear and the know-how
to keep him alive

11:26.447 --> 11:28.009
until you can
transport him.

11:29.032 --> 11:30.555
When is that?
Tonight.

11:30.643 --> 11:32.275
Happy to accept your offer.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.484
Officer, where
are you taking me?

11:36.572 --> 11:37.809
- Right this way.
- No!

11:37.896 --> 11:39.382
No, there's been a mistake.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.134
Please, I just
need to see him.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.978
- Ma'am, I'm sorry, but...
- Officer.

11:43.532 --> 11:44.618
What's the problem?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.697
Ma'am, I'm Sergeant Harrelson.
How can I help you?

11:46.784 --> 11:47.915
'M Verna Taifa.

11:48.003 --> 11:49.831
I'm looking
for my husband, Bashir.

11:51.499 --> 11:52.751
We got this.

11:54.275 --> 11:55.390
You're Bashir Taifa's wife?

11:55.478 --> 11:57.189
He called me, terrified.

11:57.314 --> 11:59.689
Said some maniac attacked him
in his car.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.085
Now I'm seeing
this nonsense on TV.

12:02.173 --> 12:03.773
- They think he's a terrorist?
- Hey, uh,

12:03.861 --> 12:05.688
you must be Bashir's son.
What's your name, bud?

12:05.775 --> 12:08.007
Maxamed,
but everybody calls me Max.

12:08.180 --> 12:09.624
Oh. Okay, Max.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.013
Tell you what,
why don't we go see

12:11.100 --> 12:12.841
if we can find you
a snack in the kitchen?

12:14.019 --> 12:15.689
All right.
Come on.

12:18.817 --> 12:19.992
Ma'am.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.864
Why don't you come with me?

12:23.486 --> 12:24.569
It's not him.

12:24.657 --> 12:27.515
There's a resemblance,
but I've known the man 12 years.

12:27.697 --> 12:29.578
He's not some
warlord killer.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.806
He's my husband.

12:30.901 --> 12:32.598
I know this is a lot
for you to take in,

12:32.686 --> 12:33.949
and I can't imagine
how you must feel...

12:34.036 --> 12:36.561
How I feel is outraged,
Sergeant.

12:36.649 --> 12:38.970
I'm staring
at a black policeman

12:39.058 --> 12:41.104
who's profiled
my husband because he looks like

12:41.192 --> 12:42.619
some other African man.

12:42.707 --> 12:44.840
I wish I was wrong.
I do.

12:45.193 --> 12:47.407
But we took his fingerprints,
and they match.

12:50.209 --> 12:53.767
My husband is a kind man,

12:53.952 --> 12:56.501
- a good father.
- I'm not gonna argue that.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.720
And he may be those things now,

12:59.028 --> 13:00.465
but back then...

13:00.739 --> 13:02.532
your husband
slaughtered families

13:02.620 --> 13:04.822
and enslaved their
children as his soldiers.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.796
I don't believe you.

13:06.961 --> 13:08.962
Have you ever met
your husband's family?

13:09.103 --> 13:11.889
They died in the war...
That's why he came here.

13:12.163 --> 13:13.228
How about his friends?

13:13.316 --> 13:14.970
Anyone who knew him
before you met?

13:15.214 --> 13:16.520
No.So you don't know

13:16.608 --> 13:18.290
anyone who knew him
20 years ago.

13:20.456 --> 13:21.876
I see what you're doing.

13:22.486 --> 13:24.126
I'm getting a lawyer.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.376
My husband's innocent.

13:30.281 --> 13:32.376
So did you manage
to dig up anything

13:32.464 --> 13:33.845
on that bar I asked about?

13:33.933 --> 13:36.204
Owner's a guy named
Teague Nolan.

13:36.431 --> 13:38.478
Got his fingers
in all kinds of naughty stuff.

13:38.566 --> 13:40.612
- Anything you can bring him in on?
- It's all whispers.

13:40.699 --> 13:42.484
Nothing concrete.
The word is,

13:42.572 --> 13:44.269
he's not a guy
you want to tangle with.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.984
- What put him on your radar?
- My brother works in his bar.

13:47.072 --> 13:48.450
I'm just trying to keep
him out of trouble.

13:48.537 --> 13:49.798
Then tell him to quit.

13:49.886 --> 13:51.501
Okay. Thanks, man.

13:52.197 --> 13:53.736
Thanks for the intel.

13:53.844 --> 13:54.907
Anytime.

13:54.995 --> 13:56.170
Yeah.

14:00.135 --> 14:02.224
Is that the family stuff
you mentioned earlier?

14:02.312 --> 14:05.493
Yeah, yeah, my foster brother
is just in a bit of a jam.

14:05.810 --> 14:07.595
Wrong place, wrong time
type of thing.

14:07.777 --> 14:09.618
I hope you're not
doing anything stupid

14:09.706 --> 14:10.720
to get him out of it.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.195
What's that supposed to mean?
Come on.

14:12.282 --> 14:13.624
Misplaced family loyalties

14:13.712 --> 14:15.595
is what got you
in trouble last time.

14:16.262 --> 14:18.263
I'm only saying this
because I care, and because...

14:18.683 --> 14:20.381
maybe you need to hear it.

14:20.673 --> 14:23.361
Thanks. I'm not gonna
do anything stupid.

14:23.845 --> 14:25.125
I'll figure it out.

14:36.939 --> 14:39.798
What happened?
How is Syed still alive?

14:39.922 --> 14:42.476
You and Musa were
supposed to kill him. We tried.

14:42.564 --> 14:45.759
Outside the police station.
But I guess we missed.

14:45.876 --> 14:47.408
On the news, they say

14:47.495 --> 14:49.211
they're sending him to Europe
to stand trial.

14:49.298 --> 14:51.179
Where he'll get
hot meals, a soft bed

14:51.267 --> 14:52.814
and an army of lawyers.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.458
- Is that justice?
- No.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.417
This is why we can't
let that happen.

14:56.697 --> 14:58.445
We must get to Syed
before he leaves the country.

14:58.532 --> 14:59.577
Yes, but how?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.161
We don't even know
where he is now.

15:01.248 --> 15:04.164
I have a friend.
A dispatcher for the police.

15:04.305 --> 15:06.361
She hears everything
on her radio.

15:06.454 --> 15:07.624
Maybe she knows.

15:07.712 --> 15:09.473
Good. See what you
can find out.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.275
But in case
that doesn't work,

15:11.368 --> 15:13.704
I know another way
we can get to Syed.

15:30.015 --> 15:32.259
How long am I gonna be here?

15:32.588 --> 15:34.665
Till the ICC's ready
for extradition.

15:35.642 --> 15:37.017
Can you at least uncuff me?

15:37.136 --> 15:38.615
Sit down and shut up.

15:47.837 --> 15:49.687
How is it I have offended you?

15:59.390 --> 16:01.189
Cuff his ass to the table.

16:06.587 --> 16:07.681
Here.

16:08.757 --> 16:10.642
I'm gonna go get us
some food.

16:18.189 --> 16:19.282
Deacon, Chris,

16:19.369 --> 16:20.327
this is Zara.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.242
She's a dispatcher
over at Central,

16:22.329 --> 16:23.808
and she just heard
from a fellow Somali

16:23.895 --> 16:25.165
with an interesting request.

16:25.253 --> 16:27.460
We're a small community.
Many of us know each other.

16:27.548 --> 16:29.587
A man called me named Abdi.

16:29.845 --> 16:31.182
He wanted to know
if I heard anything

16:31.269 --> 16:33.026
about where the police
were keeping Aden Syed.

16:33.113 --> 16:34.199
Offered to pay me

16:34.287 --> 16:35.294
if I told him.

16:35.382 --> 16:36.402
One of the shooters, maybe?

16:36.489 --> 16:37.715
Or someone connected to them.

16:38.083 --> 16:39.389
What did you say? The truth.

16:39.587 --> 16:40.869
Said I hadn't heard anything.

16:40.978 --> 16:42.523
He told me to see
if I could find out.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.531
Okay, good. That gives us
something to work with.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.091
Whether this guy Abdi is
one of the shooters or not,

16:47.179 --> 16:48.369
we gotta get our hands on him.

16:48.456 --> 16:50.531
According to Zara, he's waiting
on her to call him back.

16:50.618 --> 16:51.532
Good. That's perfect.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.017
Let's have her make that call.

16:53.105 --> 16:55.362
Tell him that she does not want
to discuss it over the phone.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.642
She will meet with him
in person on her lunch break.

16:57.753 --> 16:59.720
- Somewhere we can control.
- Exactly.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.150
Use Luca's food truck.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.934
Pull Abdi's photo
off of DMV records,

17:03.021 --> 17:04.868
and then we snatch him up
as soon as we get eyes on him.

17:04.955 --> 17:06.492
All over it. Stay sharp, man.

17:06.580 --> 17:07.939
We don't know if
he's working alone.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.390
- Understood.
- Deacon,

17:09.478 --> 17:11.353
the Somali community's
full of good people.

17:11.441 --> 17:12.594
I got to know a lot of them

17:12.682 --> 17:14.095
while I was deployed over there.

17:14.228 --> 17:17.742
But what Syed did
could bring out the worst in anyone.

17:18.031 --> 17:19.540
All right, I'll keep you posted.

17:48.219 --> 17:50.477
Why do you act like
I've done something to you?

17:50.681 --> 17:52.157
Like you know me.

17:57.596 --> 17:58.923
I do know you.

17:59.243 --> 18:00.563
I don't think so.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.477
Maybe you know the lies
that you see on TV.

18:03.688 --> 18:05.931
The fake news
America creates

18:06.019 --> 18:07.806
to justify their wars.

18:08.241 --> 18:09.391
But that's not me.

18:09.479 --> 18:12.133
Eat your sandwich.
Other than that,

18:12.221 --> 18:13.657
keep your mouth shut.

18:20.215 --> 18:21.956
Anybody got eyes
on the suspect?

18:22.470 --> 18:23.790
All clear on the one-side.

18:23.878 --> 18:25.063
All clear on the two.

18:25.151 --> 18:27.022
These pupusas are
the bomb, though.

18:29.751 --> 18:30.761
Deac, hold up.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.524
Your 12 o'clock.
Other side of the truck.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.165
Got him.

18:40.595 --> 18:43.102
- Rabbit!
- LAPD. Hold it right there!

18:43.450 --> 18:44.669
<i>Let's go!</i>

18:58.474 --> 18:59.910
30-David to Command.

18:59.998 --> 19:01.266
We're Code 4.

19:03.856 --> 19:05.938
- Nice work nabbing Abdi.
- Thanks.

19:06.026 --> 19:08.712
But we've got a new problem.
A bigger one.

19:08.995 --> 19:10.883
This just went up
on YouTube.

19:12.738 --> 19:15.977
This message is
for Aden Syed,

19:16.173 --> 19:17.969
the famous Saw Man.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.071
Time has come for you
to confess your crimes.

19:21.266 --> 19:23.860
No longer will you
escape justice.

19:24.033 --> 19:26.285
We have prepared a list
of the atrocities

19:26.373 --> 19:28.668
we personally know
you are guilty of.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.738
You will videotape
your confession,

19:30.884 --> 19:33.016
and post it within four hours

19:33.267 --> 19:35.980
to all the major news
sites for the world to see.

19:36.291 --> 19:39.033
If you do not comply,
we will do to your family

19:39.152 --> 19:40.762
what you did to ours.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.722
You will watch your child
kill his own mother.

19:42.863 --> 19:44.980
That's Verna. And Max.

19:45.068 --> 19:46.715
Here is your statement.

19:53.707 --> 19:56.129
Syed, we just received word

19:56.217 --> 19:57.871
that your wife and son
were kidnapped.

20:00.112 --> 20:02.254
The kidnappers are demanding
you read a confession

20:02.342 --> 20:03.542
in exchange for their freedom.

20:05.013 --> 20:06.206
Is this correct?

20:06.294 --> 20:08.296
- It is.
- I'm not speaking to you.

20:08.693 --> 20:10.941
I'm speaking to your
commanding officer.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.727
The one who refuses
to speak to me.

20:16.596 --> 20:18.449
We can record
your confession from here

20:18.537 --> 20:19.872
and send it out
before the deadline

20:19.959 --> 20:21.612
in a little less
than four hours.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.495
That'll buy us time to
locate your wife and your son,

20:24.583 --> 20:25.802
and rescue them.

20:26.700 --> 20:29.035
You were a soldier once,
weren't you?

20:29.626 --> 20:31.129
A Marine.

20:31.603 --> 20:33.175
Were you in Somalia?

20:33.263 --> 20:34.568
Did you fight there?

20:34.952 --> 20:36.371
Is that why you think
you know me?

20:36.459 --> 20:38.675
I was stationed in
Merca and Kismayo.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.675
You must have seen
terrible things.

20:42.748 --> 20:45.933
You also must have heard
terrible things about me.

20:47.335 --> 20:49.665
What if I told you
those stories were

20:49.753 --> 20:51.394
invented by my enemies?

20:51.560 --> 20:53.754
That I let people
believe those lies

20:53.842 --> 20:55.644
because it served a purpose.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.050
In Somalia, to be feared
was to stay alive.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.481
We are not talking
about Somalia!

21:01.927 --> 21:05.279
We are talking about saving the
life of your wife and your son

21:05.367 --> 21:07.097
right here, right now.

21:07.413 --> 21:10.590
Now, are you willing to read
that confession or not?

21:15.877 --> 21:17.761
First, you break bread with me

21:18.050 --> 21:20.527
and tell me the things
that you saw in Somalia.

21:21.591 --> 21:24.402
It will be good to talk
of my homeland again.

21:27.582 --> 21:29.134
Feiruz Hussein Abdi.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.103
No priors.

21:31.596 --> 21:33.511
Married, with
three kids.

21:33.723 --> 21:34.751
Got a nice job

21:34.839 --> 21:36.493
at a Somali restaurant
on Fairfax.

21:36.806 --> 21:38.764
Do you know where
Syed's wife and son are?

21:39.015 --> 21:40.391
Who's holding them?

21:41.304 --> 21:43.236
So, what turns
a law-abiding citizen

21:43.324 --> 21:44.759
into a vigilante?

21:46.080 --> 21:48.025
That burn mark on your arm.

21:48.517 --> 21:49.861
Syed's men give that to you?

21:49.949 --> 21:50.978
Judging from your age,

21:51.066 --> 21:53.447
you must have been a kid
during the Somali Civil War.

21:55.217 --> 21:57.785
Were you a child
soldier in Syed's army?

21:59.322 --> 22:00.376
I was young

22:00.464 --> 22:03.095
when Syed forced me to fight.

22:03.385 --> 22:06.040
I have not had
a full night's sleep

22:06.127 --> 22:07.767
since I was ten years old.

22:07.855 --> 22:11.033
What do you know about the
kidnapping of Syed's family?

22:11.121 --> 22:12.314
Syed will pay.

22:12.402 --> 22:13.744
He is a great evil

22:13.832 --> 22:16.283
that needs to be eliminated
from this world.

22:16.371 --> 22:19.228
Even at the cost of a mother
and a child dying horribly?

22:20.353 --> 22:21.528
Think about
your own mother.

22:21.616 --> 22:23.880
Do not ever speak

22:23.968 --> 22:26.622
of my mother again.

22:28.568 --> 22:30.613
Imagine the stuff he saw.

22:30.701 --> 22:31.955
Or did.

22:32.694 --> 22:34.609
Child goes through
something that traumatic,

22:34.697 --> 22:36.299
how do you even begin to work
your way back from that?

22:36.386 --> 22:38.673
I only know my own story.

22:38.853 --> 22:41.767
For me, going through trauma
bonded me to my brother, Nate.

22:41.855 --> 22:43.135
As a kid,
I was willing to fight,

22:43.222 --> 22:44.650
even die for him
if necessary.

22:44.753 --> 22:46.884
Yeah, but these kidnappers,
they're not kids anymore.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.981
That doesn't mean
the scars have healed.

22:49.209 --> 22:50.587
Trauma's still real.

22:50.824 --> 22:52.791
And now they're using the skills
they learned in Syed's army

22:52.878 --> 22:54.291
- to get revenge against him.
- Chris and I

22:54.378 --> 22:56.151
could head down to
the restaurant where Abdi works,

22:56.238 --> 22:57.581
- see if anyone knows anything.
- All right.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.587
I'll go through
his social media,

22:58.675 --> 23:00.236
- see if I can find anything.
- Okay.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.228
Excuse me.
Are you Idil Barni?

23:06.316 --> 23:07.892
I am.
How may I help you?

23:07.980 --> 23:10.504
I'm Officer Alonso.
This is Officer Street. LAPD SWAT.

23:10.592 --> 23:12.768
- Do you have a second?
- Yes.

23:16.306 --> 23:18.994
We have some questions about
one of your employees, Abdi.

23:19.082 --> 23:21.215
He was arrested trying
to bribe an LAPD employee

23:21.303 --> 23:23.040
for information
about Aden Syed.

23:23.128 --> 23:25.150
We saw on TV
that Syed is alive.

23:25.349 --> 23:27.134
Abdi was upset.

23:27.793 --> 23:29.431
That explains why
he missed his shift.

23:29.519 --> 23:31.322
Well, Abdi may be
in more trouble

23:31.410 --> 23:32.244
than you realize.

23:32.332 --> 23:33.259
He might be involved

23:33.347 --> 23:35.322
in the kidnapping
of Syed's family.

23:35.410 --> 23:37.157
Now, do you know anyone else
he could be working with?

23:37.244 --> 23:39.298
Anyone who might
want revenge on Syed?

23:39.386 --> 23:42.348
There are fathers, mothers,
schoolteachers and mechanics

23:42.436 --> 23:43.900
who eat at my restaurant,

23:43.988 --> 23:46.142
and every one of them
would want to see Syed dead.

23:46.230 --> 23:48.267
Syed is in police custody.

23:48.355 --> 23:49.815
He'll stand trial
for his crimes at the Hague.

23:49.902 --> 23:52.486
Wasn't he supposed to
stand trial 25 years ago?

23:53.165 --> 23:54.321
I'm sorry.

23:54.409 --> 23:55.728
I respect the police,

23:55.816 --> 23:57.079
the job you do,

23:57.167 --> 23:58.556
but I have no sympathy

23:58.660 --> 23:59.704
- for butchers.
- I get it.

23:59.792 --> 24:01.143
But we need the names
of all your employees,

24:01.230 --> 24:02.971
especially anybody
close to Abdi.

24:03.745 --> 24:05.985
Nate, I can't talk right now.
I'm working a case.

24:06.073 --> 24:08.251
Nolan decided how
I have to work off my debt.

24:08.339 --> 24:10.751
He said I got to drive
five kilos of heroin

24:10.883 --> 24:12.290
to Phoenix tonight.

24:12.378 --> 24:14.762
He's coming back with the car
and drugs at closing time.

24:14.850 --> 24:15.850
Can you stall him?

24:16.578 --> 24:18.356
I tried, but he's not having it.

24:18.444 --> 24:19.897
He said it's either this
or else.

24:19.996 --> 24:21.561
Look, you know the family
I come from.

24:21.649 --> 24:24.043
I avoided doing time,
and I'm proud of that.

24:24.286 --> 24:26.569
Now I'm supposed to drive
while black

24:26.657 --> 24:29.397
with 25 years to life
of drugs in my trunk, man?

24:29.485 --> 24:30.421
That's not gonna happen,
all right?

24:30.509 --> 24:31.875
I'll be there tonight
after closing.

24:31.962 --> 24:33.095
Okay? I'm gonna get
you out of this.

24:33.182 --> 24:34.694
Just trust me. Bye.

24:34.827 --> 24:37.210
- Is that your brother?
- Yeah.

24:37.298 --> 24:39.170
Yeah.
Problem solved. Yeah.

24:40.588 --> 24:42.397
Hondo,
the fact that the Somali community

24:42.485 --> 24:44.436
is so tight-knit
is working in our favor.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.139
I pulled up
Abdi's social media pages.

24:46.227 --> 24:48.718
I found eight men that have the same scar
on their arm that he has.

24:48.805 --> 24:49.719
That means they were probably

24:49.807 --> 24:50.982
all former child soldiers,

24:51.090 --> 24:52.539
some of them likely
to be our kidnappers.

24:52.626 --> 24:54.350
Employee records from
Abdi's restaurant.

24:54.438 --> 24:56.005
Six more suspects
to consider.

24:56.108 --> 24:58.467
Six? No.
We have to narrow down that list.

24:58.555 --> 25:00.717
These kidnappers are organized.
They came together fast.

25:00.804 --> 25:02.530
I'm betting they are all local.

25:04.229 --> 25:06.725
All right. Eliminate anyone
living outside the area.

25:07.676 --> 25:09.358
Okay.

25:10.104 --> 25:11.927
That gives us eight, Hondo.
But there's

25:12.024 --> 25:14.080
no way of identifying our
kidnappers without getting eyes

25:14.167 --> 25:15.960
from someone
who knows them.

25:20.556 --> 25:21.897
Copy that.

25:22.392 --> 25:24.030
Send me and Tan the photos.

25:26.095 --> 25:28.097
You were right.
I don't want to talk to you.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.311
But if it means saving

25:29.399 --> 25:31.010
your wife and your son,
then let's chat.

25:32.123 --> 25:33.254
We have reason to believe

25:33.342 --> 25:35.388
that some of these men
kidnapped your family.

25:35.559 --> 25:37.257
Do you recognize any of them?

25:37.467 --> 25:39.436
First, answer my question.

25:40.768 --> 25:43.225
What did you see in Somalia?

26:02.552 --> 26:04.624
First time I heard
the name "the Saw Man"

26:05.305 --> 26:07.827
was when my unit
ran across a village ransacked.

26:09.037 --> 26:10.639
I found a woman

26:10.828 --> 26:12.177
who was barely alive.

26:12.374 --> 26:14.694
She had been carrying
her baby on her back.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.444
There was blood running
down her dress,

26:17.563 --> 26:20.241
dripping from behind her,
leaving a trail.

26:21.728 --> 26:25.950
Her last breath was blaming you
for what happened.

26:26.717 --> 26:28.405
And you believed her?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.874
That is war, isn't it?

26:31.964 --> 26:34.140
There's war,
and then there's evil.

26:35.923 --> 26:38.053
In that same village,
we found a ten-year-old boy,

26:38.141 --> 26:39.225
still alive.

26:39.756 --> 26:41.889
Too terrified to even
mention your name.

26:42.499 --> 26:44.147
But he told us
what happened there.

26:45.110 --> 26:46.999
Your soldiers burned down
every home,

26:47.087 --> 26:48.569
and they killed every man.

26:50.612 --> 26:53.014
And the women and children were
dragged out into the desert,

26:53.102 --> 26:54.669
and they were given a choice.

26:55.930 --> 26:59.467
They would be raped and killed
in front of their children,

26:59.680 --> 27:02.334
or the children could kill
their own mothers instead.

27:03.467 --> 27:04.702
He said that day,

27:04.790 --> 27:07.757
his mother apologized for
bringing him into the world,

27:08.997 --> 27:10.772
and then begged him
to pull the trigger

27:10.860 --> 27:13.647
so your soldiers would not
dishonor her.

27:17.884 --> 27:19.686
The children who
couldn't do it

27:20.133 --> 27:22.803
followed their mothers
into a grave.

27:23.897 --> 27:25.678
And the ones who did it...

27:26.104 --> 27:27.850
became child soldiers
for your army.

27:28.595 --> 27:32.850
So no matter what lies
you tell... that's who you are.

27:34.682 --> 27:38.030
The world has never been
ruled by weak men.

27:39.503 --> 27:41.113
Don't look at me like that.

27:41.629 --> 27:43.980
You're a monster, too, Sergeant.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.507
It's inside you.

27:46.475 --> 27:49.530
Like most, you try
to deny it, keep it down.

27:49.618 --> 27:51.319
But it's there.

27:51.518 --> 27:53.678
The monster never
completely leaves.

27:53.890 --> 27:57.024
He only waits for the right
opportunity to come out.

28:00.231 --> 28:02.608
Now that you answer
my question...

28:04.808 --> 28:06.132
I know his face.

28:07.032 --> 28:08.061
Yusef.

28:08.149 --> 28:10.421
He was 13 years old
when he joined me.

28:10.509 --> 28:12.241
Yusef Ahmed.
I'm on it.

28:18.187 --> 28:20.257
You can still save your family.

28:21.772 --> 28:23.061
Read this confession,

28:23.149 --> 28:26.065
and I will make sure that
it gets on the air in time.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.499
There's no point
in confessing.

28:32.735 --> 28:34.911
If Yusef has Verna and Max,

28:34.999 --> 28:37.428
he will kill them
no matter what I say.

28:38.291 --> 28:41.007
Because that is how
I trained him.

28:51.310 --> 28:52.703
No tears, Max.

28:52.791 --> 28:54.288
You are a soldier now.

28:54.724 --> 28:56.595
Soldiers do not cry.

28:56.683 --> 28:58.405
They do as they are told.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.452
Less than an hour to go.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.741
If Syed does not
properly confess,

29:14.236 --> 29:16.038
you know what we have to do.
Yusef,

29:16.126 --> 29:17.672
we're not really going to make
the boy do this?

29:17.759 --> 29:19.991
Syed made these rules,
not me.

29:20.079 --> 29:21.850
Have our lives
taught us nothing?

29:22.063 --> 29:24.046
- They are innocent.
- They are not innocent.

29:24.134 --> 29:26.038
They are the love and blood
of the Saw Man.

29:26.508 --> 29:30.686
It is just, and it is
poetic that he suffers.

29:34.867 --> 29:38.218
Kidnapping them,
threatening Syed, yes.

29:38.391 --> 29:40.491
But killing these two...

29:41.186 --> 29:43.257
Don't tell me
you're weak, Hamid.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.272
You know how the weak end up.

30:09.959 --> 30:12.309
- LAPD! Show me your hands!
- Police! Hands in the air.

30:12.397 --> 30:13.944
Don't move!

30:14.032 --> 30:15.163
Two.

30:15.985 --> 30:17.561
Two, two, two.

30:17.726 --> 30:19.023
Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.639
<i>- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.</i>

30:20.733 --> 30:22.423
- <i>House clear.</i>
- Sit down.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.287
What is this?
What do you want?

30:25.375 --> 30:26.489
He's not here,

30:26.577 --> 30:28.514
but there's a closet full
of men's clothing back there.

30:28.601 --> 30:29.689
And this.

30:29.776 --> 30:32.770
Employee ID,
Numark Grand hotel.

30:32.858 --> 30:35.085
- Where's Yusef?
- I don't have to say anything.

30:35.173 --> 30:37.349
Your boyfriend kidnapped an
innocent woman and her young son.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.998
And if we don't find him
soon, he's gonna kill 'em.

30:39.085 --> 30:41.614
- So where is he?
- Arrest me or go.

30:43.482 --> 30:45.663
- I know where Yusef is.
- Astur!

30:46.053 --> 30:48.839
He's with my husband, Hamid,
and another man named Musa

30:48.926 --> 30:50.356
at my house.

30:50.444 --> 30:51.889
Hamid told me
to stay away.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.599
He told me not to come
until he called me.

30:53.686 --> 30:56.288
- Where do you live?
- 321 Magnolia Drive.

30:56.376 --> 30:57.538
That's 20 minutes away.

30:57.626 --> 30:59.147
We're running out of time.

31:00.112 --> 31:01.604
Your wife and your son.

31:01.939 --> 31:03.201
Can you really just sit there

31:03.288 --> 31:04.603
knowing that you are
letting them die?

31:04.690 --> 31:06.010
You were a fighter.

31:06.144 --> 31:08.886
You know, just as I do,
there are costs in every war.

31:08.989 --> 31:11.260
War?
What war?!

31:11.348 --> 31:12.698
Syed, your battle is over.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.135
It's in the past,
and you lost!

31:17.128 --> 31:19.612
You have been living here
peacefully for 20 years.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.885
You have someone
who cares about you.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.744
You have a family.
You have a son.

31:24.831 --> 31:26.322
That has to matter to you!

31:27.760 --> 31:31.705
Please. At least
try to save them.

31:44.737 --> 31:46.070
Call the department P.I.O.

31:46.228 --> 31:47.873
Have 'em alert
the local news networks.

31:47.961 --> 31:49.463
On it.

31:57.429 --> 31:58.815
Go ahead.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.953
My name is Aden Syed.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.424
I hold in my hand
a statement,

32:03.512 --> 32:06.072
a confession I'm being
pressured to read.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.362
I've been told there are
lives depending on it.

32:10.518 --> 32:11.783
Yusef...

32:12.721 --> 32:15.142
And I'm speaking directly
to you now...

32:15.893 --> 32:17.449
Do you not know me?

32:17.924 --> 32:19.494
Do you really
think I would put

32:19.581 --> 32:22.106
a woman and child
above my values and principles?

32:22.299 --> 32:24.282
Confessions,
apologies...

32:24.517 --> 32:26.197
They are not for me.

32:26.579 --> 32:27.892
So... You son of a bitch!

32:27.980 --> 32:30.087
- You son of a bitch!
- Hondo!

32:30.175 --> 32:32.158
Hey, Hondo!
Hey, get off him!

32:32.246 --> 32:34.422
Come on, get off!
Come on!

32:36.884 --> 32:38.165
There it is.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.306
There's the monster.

32:48.291 --> 32:49.775
It's Deacon.

32:51.609 --> 32:54.263
Deacon, tell me
you found Verna and Max.

32:54.421 --> 32:56.526
- We've got an address. We're on our way.
- Call Command.

32:56.613 --> 32:57.963
You have patrol
clear the streets.

32:58.051 --> 33:00.251
We're still 15 minutes out.
Patrol might

33:00.373 --> 33:01.635
beat us there,
but they can't make entry,

33:01.722 --> 33:03.103
not with
hostages at stake.

33:03.191 --> 33:04.197
Hondo, we might be too late.

33:04.284 --> 33:05.564
Deacon,
don't you say that to me.

33:05.696 --> 33:07.345
You get there
as fast as you can!

33:16.997 --> 33:20.217
Time is up.
He didn't do it.

33:20.305 --> 33:22.829
Syed didn't read the confession.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.817
Yusef, please.

33:46.739 --> 33:48.784
You are no longer a boy.

33:49.262 --> 33:51.587
Now, you become a man,

33:51.766 --> 33:55.532
just as Hamid, Musa
and I did once,

33:55.620 --> 33:57.361
at the orders
of your father.

34:06.497 --> 34:08.126
Street, we need eyes inside.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.344
Roger.

34:26.936 --> 34:28.243
Don't cry.

34:28.337 --> 34:30.304
You are only doing
what must be done.

34:30.393 --> 34:31.571
No.

34:32.563 --> 34:34.876
Following orders.

34:35.018 --> 34:37.204
Same as I did for your father.

34:41.797 --> 34:43.360
Kill her.

34:43.703 --> 34:45.259
Or I willkill you.

34:49.824 --> 34:51.234
Deac, we're out of time.

34:53.712 --> 34:56.210
- LAPD! Drop your weapon!
- LAPD! On the ground!

34:56.299 --> 34:57.968
- On the ground now! Face down...
- LAPD SWAT!

34:58.055 --> 35:00.984
- Drop your weapon!
- Stay back, or I'll shoot!

35:03.246 --> 35:05.195
You lower your gun
and let the boy go.

35:05.283 --> 35:08.172
I gave the boy a choice,
the same choice Syed gave us.

35:08.306 --> 35:10.141
His soldiers forced us
to kill our own families.

35:10.228 --> 35:11.289
But you survived.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.594
You created a life for yourself.
Don't become like Syed.

35:13.722 --> 35:15.257
What do you expect me to be?

35:16.297 --> 35:18.133
Come here.
Come here, come here. I got you.

35:18.306 --> 35:20.141
I got you.
You're safe.

35:20.238 --> 35:21.945
You're safe.

35:25.098 --> 35:27.156
30-David to
Command, we're Code 4.

35:27.251 --> 35:29.641
Three suspects in custody.
Both hostages secure.

35:29.729 --> 35:31.344
I need an R/A roll
into my location

35:31.432 --> 35:33.375
for a GSW to one
of the suspects.

35:44.056 --> 35:45.664
You know, Syed,
you're right.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.680
There is a monster
in all of us.

35:48.123 --> 35:50.561
But it's our choices
that separate us,

35:50.656 --> 35:52.353
and it's the stronger
man who chooses

35:52.441 --> 35:54.269
to keep the monster down.

35:54.518 --> 35:56.062
If you say so.

35:58.214 --> 35:59.812
Hondo?

36:00.326 --> 36:02.031
She'd like
a final word.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.976
The men who took me
showed me their scars,

36:11.207 --> 36:13.000
told me
their stories.

36:13.436 --> 36:14.836
I will not miss you.

36:15.265 --> 36:17.383
- Max!
- Max doesn't want to speak to you.

36:17.532 --> 36:19.534
He didn't even want
to come here.

36:20.594 --> 36:22.625
You are no longer
his father.

37:11.852 --> 37:12.852
Hey.

37:13.174 --> 37:14.617
Where you headed?

37:14.705 --> 37:16.577
It's your brother,
isn't it?

37:16.665 --> 37:18.626
I'll come with. Maybe I can help
with whatever the problem is.

37:18.713 --> 37:21.656
I'm good. Honestly,
it's fine. Don't worry.

37:21.828 --> 37:23.749
I know where you're headed.
Down to that shady bar

37:23.836 --> 37:25.163
in Long Beach where your
brother works, all right?

37:25.250 --> 37:27.138
Chris, it's fine. Seriously.

37:27.226 --> 37:29.124
- Just leave it, all right?
- First your mom, then Nate.

37:29.211 --> 37:31.561
Why is it your job to save your
family every time they screw up?

37:31.648 --> 37:32.836
Chris,

37:32.924 --> 37:35.263
I get your concern
and I appreciate that,

37:35.351 --> 37:37.541
but at some point,
you're gonna have to trust me.

37:37.628 --> 37:40.107
Okay? Don't try to manage
my life. I'm not a kid.

37:40.195 --> 37:41.930
Hey!
I said leave it.

37:42.018 --> 37:43.865
- What's going on?
- Mr. Grown-Up over here

37:43.953 --> 37:44.983
is about to go
down to Long Beach

37:45.070 --> 37:46.773
and do something really stupid.

37:47.305 --> 37:48.639
Street?

37:48.843 --> 37:50.359
I know what I'm doing.

37:50.507 --> 37:51.628
And by the way,

37:51.716 --> 37:54.101
off the job, I don't have
to answer to either of you.

38:03.898 --> 38:05.594
- Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.

38:05.682 --> 38:06.922
What are you doing
in our bed?

38:07.010 --> 38:09.471
Mommy was just
reading me a story.

38:09.639 --> 38:10.788
Want to join us?

38:11.170 --> 38:13.189
Okay.
What do you got?

38:13.385 --> 38:14.635
Oh, that's a good one.

38:14.723 --> 38:16.231
Tell you what, why don't
you go pick a different book

38:16.318 --> 38:17.312
and then you can
read to us, okay?

38:17.400 --> 38:18.635
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.750
So how'd the kids do
with the psychiatrist today?

38:26.838 --> 38:28.156
It was a bit
rocky at first,

38:28.243 --> 38:29.267
for Lila.

38:29.355 --> 38:31.799
She's got her old man's
stoic nature.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.510
Not always a good thing, huh?

38:34.641 --> 38:36.658
Dr. Collins was
great, though.

38:36.767 --> 38:37.883
Once she got
Lila talking,

38:37.971 --> 38:40.627
she gave me and her
some really helpful tools

38:40.715 --> 38:42.588
to help her work
through the anxiety.

38:43.429 --> 38:44.822
It's a start.

38:46.572 --> 38:48.580
I'm sorry I couldn't be there.

38:49.463 --> 38:50.547
I really wanted to be.

38:50.712 --> 38:51.923
I know.

38:55.706 --> 38:57.088
<i>♪ Shining down... ♪</i>

38:57.244 --> 38:58.799
There's my baby.

39:00.016 --> 39:01.580
Hey, Mama.

39:01.775 --> 39:03.314
You look tired.

39:03.539 --> 39:04.908
I am.

39:05.063 --> 39:06.369
Where's Pop?

39:06.528 --> 39:10.455
I asked him to go to Brianna's
so that you and I could talk.

39:12.187 --> 39:14.755
<i>♪ This world was made for you ♪</i>

39:15.069 --> 39:19.682

39:20.009 --> 39:22.357
<i>♪ In all the things

39:22.445 --> 39:24.473
I don't want him
to hurt you again.

39:25.234 --> 39:27.249
Loneliness hurts, too.

39:29.085 --> 39:30.117
Last night,

39:30.205 --> 39:31.834
when your father
and I were talking

39:31.922 --> 39:34.794
and he started
trying to apologize...

39:34.882 --> 39:36.257
Okay, but Mama,

39:36.472 --> 39:38.624
you deserve better
than what he did to you.

39:38.712 --> 39:39.844
I know.

39:39.932 --> 39:41.179
But with who?

39:41.267 --> 39:44.093
Some other old man
whose mistakes I don't know?

39:45.304 --> 39:48.236
This illness has burned
the hustle out of your daddy.

39:48.421 --> 39:50.593
I see his gentle side again.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.326
What's going on?
What are you doing?

39:52.414 --> 39:53.633
I don't know.

39:54.599 --> 39:56.718
All of this is just...

39:56.984 --> 39:59.224
taking me back to a time
when I was young,

39:59.312 --> 40:01.457
when I had my whole life
ahead of me.

40:01.545 --> 40:03.828
- When I used to be beautiful.
- Stop that.

40:04.180 --> 40:05.921
You always gonna be beautiful.

40:06.663 --> 40:07.769
To you.

40:07.865 --> 40:08.874
That's right.

40:10.413 --> 40:13.218
♪ All the things you're
gonna do now, honey... ♪

40:26.515 --> 40:28.015
Get your ass in here, Nate.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.687
I need this delivery in Phoenix
by the morning.

40:34.686 --> 40:36.080
- You brought a cop?
- Relax.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.070
I'm not here to bust anybody.

40:38.158 --> 40:39.773
I'm just here
to negotiate for Nate.

40:39.861 --> 40:41.471
Yes, he's my brother.

40:41.927 --> 40:43.625
Foster brother.

40:44.523 --> 40:45.558
Here's the deal:

40:45.671 --> 40:47.958
you let Nate walk away
from all this,

40:48.046 --> 40:49.685
and I don't tell
my friends in Narcotics

40:49.773 --> 40:51.214
about your little
side business here.

40:51.318 --> 40:54.687
- What do you say?
- No reason we can't all walk away happy.

40:56.269 --> 40:58.568
Yeah, what would make me happy
is to have my product

40:58.656 --> 41:00.146
in Phoenix before the morning.

41:00.234 --> 41:01.419
Nobody move!

41:01.507 --> 41:02.625
- Get your hands up!
- Whoa, whoa.

41:02.712 --> 41:04.419
- Hands up!
- Drop it, now!

41:04.507 --> 41:05.688
- You set me up again?
- No!

41:05.775 --> 41:07.924
I didn't.
We just came in for a drink, man.

41:08.012 --> 41:09.281
Yeah?
And we just want the drugs.

41:09.368 --> 41:10.762
We're just gonna head out,
all right? No trouble from us.

41:10.849 --> 41:12.945
Shut the hell up
and don't move!

41:13.385 --> 41:15.460
- Hey, take it easy, okay?
- You want to see easy?

41:15.584 --> 41:19.187
I will shoot you in the face,
real easy!

41:39.212 --> 41:40.345
Okay.

41:40.470 --> 41:42.062
Okay. Just go.

41:42.150 --> 41:45.408
I'm gonna take care of this.
Go! Go! All of you. Go on. Go, go!

41:45.496 --> 41:46.802
Get out of here.
All of you!

41:46.890 --> 41:49.353
Go! Go! Come on!
