00:18.907 --> 00:20.431
It's alive!

00:38.927 --> 00:41.020
Kids, I've enlisted the help of
some rappers

00:41.096 --> 00:43.291
I've found on
the Craig's List to explain

00:43.365 --> 00:45.390
Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:45.467 --> 00:48.197
So come on in guys.
This is the class.

00:52.874 --> 00:53.863
# I'm E, what up #

00:53.942 --> 00:55.239
# And I'm MC Square #

00:55.310 --> 00:57.141
# We came to rhyme and
we came prepared #

00:57.212 --> 00:59.407
# Yo, I like this beat that you're
giving me #

00:59.481 --> 01:01.881
# Now tell me
the theory of relativity #

01:01.950 --> 01:03.815
# E stands for energy,
sucker fool #

01:03.885 --> 01:06.376
# It's not measured in watts bitch,
it's measured in joules #

01:06.454 --> 01:08.183
# But listen up class,
the M is for mass #

01:08.256 --> 01:10.588
# And if you don't like it you
can kiss my ass #

01:10.659 --> 01:12.559
# The C stands for speed of
light in a vacuum #

01:12.627 --> 01:14.652
# So back up hoes and give us
some room #

01:14.729 --> 01:16.754
# And the theory of mass
requires rest energy #

01:16.831 --> 01:17.661
# Without a hitch #

01:17.732 --> 01:19.222
# Which made Newton's second law
that appears #

01:19.301 --> 01:22.065
# That nonrelative class
mechanics, bitch #

01:26.074 --> 01:28.872
Einstein mother fucker!

01:29.878 --> 01:32.506
Yo! We also got one about
algebra!

01:32.580 --> 01:37.779
Yeah, yeah, A squared times B
squared equals these nuts, bitch!

01:43.425 --> 01:44.892
Ow, oh
Ow, oh.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.928
Uh, those things are anus
shattering.

01:46.995 --> 01:48.189
Uh, uh, uh!

01:48.263 --> 01:50.561
Over heated again?

01:50.632 --> 01:53.066
You cheap little rice burner
piece of crap!

01:53.134 --> 01:55.102
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:55.170 --> 01:58.139
Oh, yeah!
That's a weird traffic marking.

01:58.206 --> 02:01.073
Whoa!
Holy shit!

02:01.142 --> 02:03.042
Oh, oh, ugh!

02:03.111 --> 02:06.103
Ow!
I can't feel my legs.

02:06.181 --> 02:07.648
Oh, oh thank you.

02:07.716 --> 02:09.684
Oh, oh thank you.
Bless you.

02:09.751 --> 02:11.878
I need to go to a hospital.

02:11.953 --> 02:13.682
Oh thank you so much.
Thank you.

02:13.755 --> 02:17.851
Oh, ahh, oh!
Ahh!

02:17.926 --> 02:19.655
Mother fucking game!

02:20.195 --> 02:22.993
Uh-oh, my war injury's
acting up again.

02:24.165 --> 02:25.894
Do it again uncle Glen!

02:27.068 --> 02:28.092
Maybe later.

02:28.169 --> 02:30.535
Uncle Glen needs a beer.

02:32.207 --> 02:35.370
Ahh.

02:35.443 --> 02:36.808
What the...
Who are you?

02:36.878 --> 02:39.608
Removing your finger, that's a
good power uncle Glen.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.875
I must have it.

02:41.616 --> 02:44.483
Ahh!

02:48.423 --> 02:50.152
Kids, where's your uncle Glen?

02:50.225 --> 02:51.123
We don't know mama.

02:51.192 --> 02:52.216
He's gone.

02:52.293 --> 02:55.922
Uh, he must be having one of his
explosive diarrhea attacks again.

02:55.997 --> 02:57.021
Oh.

03:03.838 --> 03:05.567
Every once in a while this power
backfires.

03:07.308 --> 03:08.502
I can see!

03:08.576 --> 03:11.374
Oh Magoo,
you've done it again.

03:11.446 --> 03:13.880
What are all these dragons
made of metal...

03:30.231 --> 03:33.029
My goodness,
father what's that?

03:33.101 --> 03:35.661
It appears to be a jungle
dwelling ape man.

03:35.737 --> 03:36.567
Yeah, yeah, I know.

03:36.638 --> 03:37.832
I meant that!

03:37.906 --> 03:39.373
Oh, that's a penis.

03:39.441 --> 03:41.170
I think I like penis.

03:41.242 --> 03:43.210
Well...
you are your mother's daughter.

03:43.278 --> 03:45.007
Jane, me Jane.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.378
Jane!

03:47.449 --> 03:48.916
That's right, very good.

03:48.983 --> 03:53.943
Jane! Jane, Jane, ooh, ooh,
ooh Jane.

03:54.022 --> 03:55.751
Yes!
My name is Jane!

03:59.961 --> 04:01.758
Me save you!

04:07.068 --> 04:09.696
Tarzan, my hero.

04:09.771 --> 04:10.863
Growl

04:14.876 --> 04:17.344
Tarzan,
my hero.

04:18.512 --> 04:19.343
Ah!

04:38.800 --> 04:44.363
Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Ahhh!

04:44.439 --> 04:47.465
Oh! Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Uh, uh, uh, uh

04:52.847 --> 04:53.677
Ahh!

04:56.784 --> 04:59.252
Ahh!

04:59.320 --> 05:05.884
Uh, ah, oh!
Uh, ah, oh!

05:13.301 --> 05:14.325
Huh!

05:14.402 --> 05:17.929
Tarzan, don't move,
I'll go get you a doctor.

05:18.006 --> 05:23.069
No, Jane, humans bad.
Me no want doctor.

05:23.144 --> 05:25.806
Me no want Jane neither.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.871
You mean either, not...

05:27.949 --> 05:30.383
Me freaking ape man,
me no give crap!

05:31.553 --> 05:33.817
Tarzan never saw Jane again,

05:33.888 --> 05:36.914
his broken body was mended by
the best jungle medicine

05:36.991 --> 05:38.253
the apes could provide.

05:53.408 --> 05:54.432
Uh-oh!

05:58.813 --> 06:00.144
Hmm?

06:00.215 --> 06:02.342
I wonder where the ocean is
going.

06:02.817 --> 06:06.514
We the jury find the defendant,
delightful!

06:06.588 --> 06:08.317
Well thank you very much.

06:19.167 --> 06:21.294
I flossed and brushed
my teeth again.

06:21.369 --> 06:24.099
They say only floss the ones you
want to keep.

06:24.172 --> 06:25.799
I always liked that joke.

06:25.873 --> 06:28.000
Then I swished around some
mouth wash.

06:28.076 --> 06:30.101
Kills gingivitis.

06:30.178 --> 06:32.305
Damn gingivitis.

06:32.380 --> 06:34.109
Leading cause of gum disease.

06:34.182 --> 06:37.379
Saw an old lady trying to cross
the street.

06:37.452 --> 06:40.182
Grandma couldn't have been less
than 90 years old.

06:40.255 --> 06:42.223
Probably seen a lot over those
years.

06:42.290 --> 06:46.488
Lots of stories to tell and a
family that loves her.

06:46.561 --> 06:48.529
Let me help you out granny.

06:48.596 --> 06:51.759
Stopped the cars to make sure
granny could cross.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.027
I'm walking here!

06:53.101 --> 06:54.568
I love that line.

06:55.937 --> 06:58.963
Then I saw some pussy that made
my heart stop.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.167
Pussy was caught up in the tree.

07:01.242 --> 07:02.971
A kid crying for it.

07:03.044 --> 07:06.070
Poor kid, probably not old
enough to tie his shoe

07:06.147 --> 07:09.241
and his damn kitten's life is in
my hands.

07:09.317 --> 07:10.579
Here ya go buddy.

07:10.652 --> 07:13.587
Tipped the barista five bucks for
my soy latte.

07:13.655 --> 07:16.886
These lattes are good.
Good enough to kill for.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.425
But I'd never do that.

07:18.493 --> 07:21.053
Killing is bad, unless you're
killing gingivitis.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.600
18, 19, and 20.

07:33.675 --> 07:34.869
Or one score.

07:34.942 --> 07:38.139
Getting a good ass kicking
in here.

07:38.212 --> 07:41.238
Hey Robert E. Lee, where do you
think you're going?

07:41.316 --> 07:45.150
We still have 3 score and 7
kicks to the balls to go.

07:45.219 --> 07:46.049
Ugh!

07:48.956 --> 07:50.423
This is a robbery!

07:50.491 --> 07:53.221
Fill this bag with
inconsequential bills.

07:53.294 --> 07:55.421
Wow, I'm getting robbed by
Nicole Richie...

07:55.496 --> 07:56.690
Shh!
Shut up!

07:56.764 --> 07:59.631
I want to go to prison to save
my friend Paris.

07:59.701 --> 08:02.192
For a robbery, they might just
fine you for that.

08:02.270 --> 08:03.294
Good point.

08:05.106 --> 08:08.007
Stupid celebrity,
armed robbery and murder?

08:08.076 --> 08:09.941
You'll be locked up for 45 days!

08:10.978 --> 08:12.445
Am I locked up?

08:12.513 --> 08:14.640
Perhaps it is you
who are locked up

08:14.716 --> 08:16.377
and I am truly free.

08:16.451 --> 08:18.351
Shut up you bitch!
Get out of my head!

08:18.419 --> 08:20.148
Ahh!
She's in my brain!

08:20.221 --> 08:21.245
Nicole, is that you?

08:21.322 --> 08:22.152
Paris!

08:22.223 --> 08:25.556
I couldn't let my best bud / meal
ticket rot in jail.

08:25.626 --> 08:27.093
Now could I?
Wink.

08:27.161 --> 08:29.129
But now we're both locked up.

08:29.197 --> 08:32.655
Don't worry, I have an escape
plan tattooed on me.

08:32.734 --> 08:34.201
I recognize those symbols.

08:34.268 --> 08:35.462
They're words Paris.

08:35.535 --> 08:36.559
What?

08:36.636 --> 08:37.831
Oh yes!

08:37.905 --> 08:39.873
Oh yeah, give it to me!

08:39.941 --> 08:45.902
Oh yeah, you're the right guard!
Yeah! Yeah!

08:45.980 --> 08:49.177
Yeah, unlock my cell!
My vagina cell!

08:49.250 --> 08:50.274
Yeah!

08:50.351 --> 08:53.445
Oh! That was great ladies, but
you got to go right back into...

08:53.521 --> 08:54.545
Oh!

08:55.723 --> 09:01.218
Agh!

09:03.364 --> 09:05.491
Hey, I forgot to use the poison.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.400
Why does that keep happening to all
my boyfriends?

09:09.470 --> 09:11.438
You should really see a
gynecologist.

09:11.506 --> 09:12.905
TV Announcer:
We now cancel Caveman

09:12.974 --> 09:14.999
to bring you breaking news from
Lynn Wood prison

09:15.076 --> 09:17.544
noted celebutards Paris Hilton
and Nicole Richie

09:17.612 --> 09:18.670
have escaped.

09:18.746 --> 09:21.476
Viewers will recall that
Nicole Richie is the daughter

09:21.549 --> 09:23.278
of famous musician
Lionel Richie.

09:30.024 --> 09:33.050
Nicole, it is over!
You've got nowhere left to run!

09:33.127 --> 09:34.594
The joke's on you!

09:34.662 --> 09:37.688
I weigh 62 pounds,
I can glide through the air!

09:37.765 --> 09:39.232
Like a spider monkey!

09:39.300 --> 09:40.961
Up! Up! And away Falkor!

09:41.035 --> 09:41.899
No!

09:41.969 --> 09:44.529
Yeah!

09:53.080 --> 09:56.106
Hmm, I could really go for
another one of those.

09:56.184 --> 09:57.913
Where is our cabana boy?

09:59.520 --> 10:01.920
Paris!

10:01.989 --> 10:05.186
Oops! I did it again.
With my vagina.

10:05.259 --> 10:06.726
Laughing makes me hungry.

10:07.328 --> 10:09.262
