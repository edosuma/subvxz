You'd just be stuck in
a hotel room climbing the walls.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.574
And that's not good for anybody.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.608
Stay here.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.210
Deal with Kane.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.547
I'll call you as soon
as we have something.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.782
Okay?

12:28.782 --> 12:30.417
Mm.

12:37.352 --> 12:38.720
Where they got you doing
your physical therapy?

12:38.720 --> 12:40.889
KANE:
"They." (chuckles)

12:40.889 --> 12:43.391
Nigga, they ain't got me
doing shit.

12:43.391 --> 12:45.193
(groans)

12:45.193 --> 12:46.695
(sighs)

12:46.928 --> 12:49.130
(groans)

12:50.432 --> 12:52.233
A month ago...

12:53.735 --> 12:56.171
...doctor told me...

12:56.171 --> 13:00.742
(sighs) I wasn't gonna
be able to walk again.

13:00.742 --> 13:05.547
So, either I'm a goddamn
medical miracle,

13:05.547 --> 13:09.718
or they don't know what
the fuck they're talking about.

13:09.718 --> 13:12.020
And you and I both know...

13:14.956 --> 13:17.559
...ain't no fucking miracles
around here.

13:17.559 --> 13:19.294
(flicks lighter)

13:19.394 --> 13:22.397
You helped me out when
I was where you are, so...

13:26.601 --> 13:28.837
Fuck you doing here, Saint?

13:30.171 --> 13:31.373
Hmm?

13:31.373 --> 13:32.440
Well...

13:33.341 --> 13:37.178
Want to make you more money,
of course.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.448
But with the demand
that's out there,

13:40.448 --> 13:41.950
the territory you have,

13:41.950 --> 13:44.386
we ain't moving nearly
enough product.

13:44.386 --> 13:46.187
Mm.

13:46.187 --> 13:49.491
You mean we not moving
your product fast enough?

13:49.491 --> 13:50.825
(chuckles)

13:50.992 --> 13:52.193
Well, as far as I can tell,

13:52.193 --> 13:54.062
it's not the moving it
that's the problem.

13:54.162 --> 13:56.264
It's the making it
that's got us held up.

13:56.398 --> 13:57.866
RICKY:
Shooting it out on the street

13:57.866 --> 13:59.234
with your family ain't helping.

13:59.334 --> 14:01.870
But if it's cooking
you got a problem with,

14:01.870 --> 14:02.937
maybe you should get in there,

14:03.104 --> 14:03.972
rock that shit up yourself.

14:03.972 --> 14:06.674
Oh, I will if I have to.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.376
Hell yeah, I would.

14:08.376 --> 14:11.179
But first I'd like to take
a look at your cookhouses.

14:11.279 --> 14:13.715
See if I might be able
to improve the situation.

14:13.948 --> 14:15.383
(laughs)

14:18.053 --> 14:21.022
I'm sorry, take a look
at my cookhouses?

14:21.189 --> 14:24.559
This motherfucker right here,

14:24.559 --> 14:26.394
up in his suit

14:26.528 --> 14:30.331
like he the CEO
of the fucking R-O-C-K.

14:30.331 --> 14:32.300
(laughs)

14:39.841 --> 14:43.311
You know, I...
I built an empire.

14:44.245 --> 14:46.047
If you don't want to know
how I did it, fine.

14:46.147 --> 14:50.151
I thought we was in this shit
to get rich, right?

14:50.151 --> 14:53.021
Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.

14:54.923 --> 14:56.157
Ricky.

14:56.991 --> 14:58.927
Take him to the cookhouse.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.962
Tell 'em what's coming
out of his mouth

15:00.962 --> 15:03.031
is coming out of mine.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.868
Anything else?

15:07.869 --> 15:09.838
No, we good.

15:14.776 --> 15:16.911
<i>(vehicle approaching)</i>

15:21.316 --> 15:24.419
- (engine shuts off)
- (car door opens)

15:24.419 --> 15:26.321
(car door closes)

15:30.058 --> 15:31.626
It's confirmed.

15:31.860 --> 15:33.895
No survivors.

15:33.995 --> 15:36.431
They took everything off
the bodies and the cars.

15:36.431 --> 15:38.299
Just vanished.

15:44.005 --> 15:46.341
I warned them. Hmm?

15:46.341 --> 15:48.543
Knew that if they didn't
let the shipment go,

15:48.543 --> 15:51.179
we'd get fucked like a jinetera.

15:52.414 --> 15:54.349
The Center's now worried that,
uh, Teddy's gonna be spooked.

15:54.449 --> 15:57.819
They want us to accelerate
the timeline.

15:57.919 --> 16:01.056
Can you call in the, uh,
tip on the warehouse?

16:01.923 --> 16:04.325
I don't even know
exactly what's inside.

16:04.325 --> 16:07.896
Or when Teddy and his boss
will both be there.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.699
We have one chance.

16:10.699 --> 16:13.301
We can't fuck this up.

16:24.212 --> 16:28.583
Tell the Center I want to shift
away from Cissy and Franklin.

16:28.583 --> 16:29.818
I want to focus on Gustavo.

16:29.818 --> 16:32.387
He's vulnerable.

16:32.387 --> 16:34.656
Knows all the details.

16:34.856 --> 16:36.324
He'll be our way forward.

16:41.896 --> 16:43.598
(children chattering playfully)

16:43.598 --> 16:45.900
PARISSA:
So...

16:48.169 --> 16:52.107
...if I hadn't run that night,
he would have taken me.

16:53.842 --> 16:55.410
Yeah, probably.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.314
Tortured me.

16:59.314 --> 17:00.915
Killed me maybe.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.019
You wanted excitement.

17:07.155 --> 17:08.857
But I do think that
it would be a good idea

17:09.024 --> 17:09.958
if we moved you out of here.

17:09.958 --> 17:14.329
Just... till things settle down.

17:14.429 --> 17:18.099
And where were you thinking
I would go?

17:18.266 --> 17:20.435
Thinking you'd stay with me.

17:24.973 --> 17:28.076
Are you using Russian spies
as an excuse

17:28.209 --> 17:31.046
to get me to move in
with you, Teddy?

17:33.915 --> 17:35.984
I know this place isn't much,

17:35.984 --> 17:38.119
but I like it here.

17:39.254 --> 17:41.322
Besides...

17:41.322 --> 17:44.959
if you're in as much trouble
as it sounds like are,

17:45.060 --> 17:48.897
I might be wise to keep
my distance from you.

17:50.932 --> 17:54.169
I really can never tell if
you're fucking with me or not.

17:54.169 --> 17:55.970
Good.

17:55.970 --> 17:58.306
Keep you on your toes.

18:00.475 --> 18:02.077
So...

18:02.077 --> 18:06.047
how are you going to solve
your little problem?

18:06.047 --> 18:09.784
I have to figure out
how much they know.

18:09.951 --> 18:13.355
And if they know everything?

18:13.355 --> 18:15.924
No, if they knew everything,
I'd be in jail by now.

18:16.057 --> 18:17.892
You know, there's
really two options.

18:18.059 --> 18:20.562
We shut the whole thing down,

18:20.562 --> 18:22.430
cauterize the wound,

18:22.430 --> 18:23.898
and then, after that,

18:23.898 --> 18:27.902
maybe I still have
a career, maybe not.

18:28.036 --> 18:32.941
Or you take
the $70 million and...

18:33.141 --> 18:34.976
you leave the country.

18:36.544 --> 18:37.579
(chuckles)

18:37.579 --> 18:40.248
Would that be so bad?

18:41.916 --> 18:43.885
Yeah, that would be pretty bad.

18:46.021 --> 18:47.889
I understand
what you want, Teddy.

18:48.023 --> 18:52.060
But influence comes
in many forms.

18:52.894 --> 18:54.896
And one of those forms...

18:54.896 --> 18:59.067
is an obscenely large
amount of money.

19:00.068 --> 19:01.936
It may not be the way
you were raised,

19:01.936 --> 19:04.873
to believe that power
should be attained,

19:05.040 --> 19:08.543
but it can put you...

19:08.543 --> 19:11.079
at the center of things.

19:16.317 --> 19:19.387
If I had to leave,
would you come with me?

19:22.891 --> 19:24.926
Ask me when it happens.

19:25.694 --> 19:28.363
And I guess we'll see.

19:43.712 --> 19:47.015
(clattering)

19:59.894 --> 20:00.862
Aah! Ms. Saint, don't shoot!

20:00.862 --> 20:03.398
- Fuck!
- Don't shoot, please.

20:03.398 --> 20:05.433
Shit.

20:05.433 --> 20:06.468
Fuck.

20:06.468 --> 20:08.636
Wanda, what the fuck?

20:08.903 --> 20:11.639
I'm sorry, I just--
I-I just came to get my things.

20:11.639 --> 20:14.075
I-I...

20:14.209 --> 20:17.245
I had no idea
you were here, back.

20:17.245 --> 20:18.346
Yesterday.

20:20.648 --> 20:22.817
I'm still jetlagged as hell.

20:22.984 --> 20:25.420
We're living in the PJs now.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.990
I still have my key,
so I just let myself in, I...

20:29.124 --> 20:30.925
I-I just wanted to get
a few things.

20:30.925 --> 20:31.926
I didn't think you were
still living here, I...

20:31.926 --> 20:34.229
Wanda, it's-it's...

20:34.229 --> 20:35.397
it's okay.

20:36.264 --> 20:38.266
I'm really sorry, Ms. Saint.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.037
Oh, fuck, child,
I almost killed you.

20:48.610 --> 20:51.846
So how do you like
being married?

20:52.047 --> 20:55.316
It's amazing.

20:55.316 --> 20:57.819
But...

21:01.089 --> 21:04.125
I don't know how I'm gonna
make it in the projects.

21:07.595 --> 21:10.131
It's rock everywhere there.

21:15.403 --> 21:17.972
It's hard.

21:23.912 --> 21:25.914
You see all them clothes there?

21:28.850 --> 21:29.984
When Alton stopped drinking,

21:29.984 --> 21:32.520
he needed something to focus on

21:32.520 --> 21:37.025
that was bigger than himself.

21:37.192 --> 21:40.495
Gave him a sense of direction.

21:40.495 --> 21:42.030

21:42.030 --> 21:45.300
You're talking

21:45.300 --> 21:48.169
