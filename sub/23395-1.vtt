<i>February 1993.</i>

01:03.268 --> 01:05.033
<i>A massive explosion</i>

01:05.035 --> 01:06.769
<i>ripping through
the lower basement sections</i>

01:06.771 --> 01:09.605
<i>of the World Trade Center
under tower number two.</i>

01:09.607 --> 01:12.907
<i>A terrorist bomb,
how horrific a crime this is.</i>

01:12.909 --> 01:14.844
<i>August 1998.</i>

01:14.846 --> 01:18.647
<i>Our embassies in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam were bombed.</i>

01:18.649 --> 01:22.085
<i>The Bin Laden terrorist
network was responsible.</i>

01:22.087 --> 01:23.919
<i>Suicide bombers
blew a hole in the ship.</i>

01:23.921 --> 01:25.921
<i>My prayers are with the
families of those killed...</i>

01:25.923 --> 01:29.492
<i>at the explosion involving
the U.S. naval vessel</i> Cole.

01:29.494 --> 01:32.195
<i>Hidden in
the mountains of Afghanistan,</i>

01:32.197 --> 01:33.930
<i>Bin Laden planned
these attacks.</i>

01:33.932 --> 01:35.965
<i>September 9th, 2001.</i>

01:35.967 --> 01:37.400
<i>Ahmad Shah Massoud,</i>

01:37.402 --> 01:39.168
<i>the leader
of the Northern Alliance,</i>

01:39.170 --> 01:41.070
<i>was assassinated by
two members of Al-Qaeda.</i>

01:41.072 --> 01:44.641
<i>Massoud's death
destabilized the Northern Alliance,</i>

01:44.643 --> 01:46.174
<i>removing the only threat</i>

01:46.176 --> 01:48.144
<i>to the Taliban's power
in Afghanistan.</i>

02:06.464 --> 02:08.396
I can't believe
we have a fireplace.

02:08.399 --> 02:11.867
Yeah. Sort of a fireplace.
It's propane.

02:11.869 --> 02:13.271
It's a fireplace.

02:14.306 --> 02:15.406
Maddy?

02:18.809 --> 02:21.878
All right. Up you go.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.249
Okay. Let's get your shoes on.

02:25.249 --> 02:26.716
Hey, I like your drawings.

02:26.718 --> 02:27.984
It's a ladybug.

02:27.986 --> 02:30.218
A ladybug?
Wow, it's beautiful.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.388
I don't wanna
unpack this room

02:32.390 --> 02:33.955
until we get
the walls painted.

02:33.957 --> 02:35.991
And by "we," I mean you.

02:35.993 --> 02:37.493
Sounds like a lot of work.

02:37.495 --> 02:40.263
Yeah, what does that mean?

02:40.265 --> 02:42.900
Paint the walls
and I'll show you.

02:44.168 --> 02:45.501
I love this house.

02:45.503 --> 02:47.570
You gotta learn
Spanish, Daddy.

02:47.572 --> 02:49.605
Yeah, it's on the list,
sweetie.

02:49.607 --> 02:51.675
You taking me to school again?

02:51.677 --> 02:53.943
Uh-huh. And picking you up.

02:53.945 --> 02:55.144
- Really?
- Yeah!

02:55.146 --> 02:56.547
Turn that down, sweetie.

03:00.618 --> 03:04.086
Daddy, look.

03:04.088 --> 03:06.656
<i>Two planes have crashed
into the World Trade Center</i>

03:06.658 --> 03:09.425
<i>in an apparent terrorist
attack on the country.</i>

03:09.427 --> 03:11.727
<i>We have reported
that one of the planes</i>

03:11.729 --> 03:15.566
<i>was an American Airlines 767
that had been hijacked...</i>

03:36.620 --> 03:38.888
- Hey!
- Thank God! Finally.

03:38.890 --> 03:40.188
Okay!

03:44.796 --> 03:48.000
Really? Really?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.267
- What the hell, man?
- Relax, bro.

03:51.269 --> 03:53.336
- You know how nuts traffic is right now.
- Traffic?

03:53.338 --> 03:55.604
- We've been freezing our asses out here all goddamn night!
- Relax, bro.

03:55.606 --> 03:57.105
Why don't you jump your ass
in this river?

03:57.107 --> 03:58.741
What, did you stop
at Starbucks?

03:58.743 --> 04:00.443
- Where's my latte?
- Milo, it's 8:30.

04:00.445 --> 04:02.511
- What happened?
- What, you guys don't know?

04:02.513 --> 04:04.349
No, we were
in the river, man.

04:11.189 --> 04:13.088
Goddamn, they're low.

04:13.090 --> 04:14.458
Is that part of a drill?

04:16.293 --> 04:17.695
Ain't no drill.

04:21.298 --> 04:24.236
Get me Josh Bailey
at USASOC intel, please.

04:29.639 --> 04:31.440
Bailey on line three, sir.

04:31.442 --> 04:32.841
- Did you say line three?
- Yes, sir.

04:32.843 --> 04:35.944
Sound off!

04:35.946 --> 04:39.449
Josh, Jesus Christ, you guys
shit the bed on this one, huh?

04:39.451 --> 04:41.117
Was it confirmed?

04:41.119 --> 04:44.086
Well, it's not my job to know where.
That's your job.

04:44.088 --> 04:45.555
All we are is ready.

04:45.557 --> 04:48.156
Well, quit wasting time
talking to me then.

04:48.158 --> 04:49.893
Why are you here?
Out of uniform

04:49.895 --> 04:51.526
with that fur on your face.

04:51.528 --> 04:53.495
Didn't you get back from
Kuwait, like, three weeks ago?

04:53.497 --> 04:55.264
Yes, sir. Apologies.
Technically, I'm still on leave.

04:55.266 --> 04:56.966
Well, if you're here today,
leave is over.

04:56.968 --> 04:59.235
Take a look around, Captain.
We're a little busy.

04:59.237 --> 05:00.370
What do you want?

05:00.372 --> 05:02.237
I want back on my team, sir.

05:02.239 --> 05:04.473
You don't have a team. You've
been rotated to my staff.

05:04.475 --> 05:05.874
At your request, by the way.

05:05.876 --> 05:07.476
That was before. All right?

05:07.478 --> 05:09.478
Before guys were flying
fucking planes into buildings.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.115
Well, your warrant officer
turned in his retirement papers,

05:12.117 --> 05:13.550
and you've been moved up.

05:13.552 --> 05:15.684
So your team doesn't exist,
all right?

05:15.686 --> 05:19.221
You'll be filtered into new ODAs
when the opportunities arise.

05:19.223 --> 05:20.656
If I were you,
I'd get back to your desk

05:20.658 --> 05:22.492
and start studying intel
on Afghanistan.

05:22.494 --> 05:24.927
Taliban sponsored
the attack, sir?

05:24.929 --> 05:26.261
Al-Qaeda planned this attack.

05:26.263 --> 05:27.697
They have refuge
in Afghanistan.

05:27.699 --> 05:29.531
But Middle East is our
assigned region, sir.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.533
Really? I didn't know that!

05:31.535 --> 05:33.269
Here's the thing, though.
You don't have a region,

05:33.271 --> 05:34.870
'cause you don't have
a fucking team!

05:34.872 --> 05:37.607
So get back to your goddamn
desk and let me do my job!

05:37.609 --> 05:38.807
Fuck.

05:38.809 --> 05:40.742
Sergeant,
who's on line four?

05:40.744 --> 05:43.612
<i>It was not long
before that tower collapsed.</i>

05:43.614 --> 05:46.983
<i>The loss of life so far
is catastrophic,</i>

05:46.985 --> 05:49.317
<i>estimated at 10,000.</i>

05:49.319 --> 05:52.221
<i>But that number
could go much higher.</i>

05:52.223 --> 05:54.124
<i>These images from just across</i>

05:54.126 --> 05:56.192
<i>the Potomac River
of the Pentagon,</i>

05:56.194 --> 06:00.261
<i>still on fire, a fire
burning out of control</i>

06:00.263 --> 06:02.398
<i>after a hijacked airliner,
another one,</i>

06:02.400 --> 06:06.702
<i>we believe this one to have
been a United Airlines flight,</i>

06:06.704 --> 06:08.905
<i>smashed into the Pentagon
around 9:45...</i>

06:08.907 --> 06:10.172
Yo. What's up, Cap?

06:10.174 --> 06:11.273
- What up, Milo?
- What are you doing here?

06:11.275 --> 06:12.708
Trying to get my team back.

06:12.710 --> 06:14.343
Ah, your little jalapeÃ±o
ain't gonna be too happy

06:14.345 --> 06:15.711
- about that, huh?
- Yeah, maybe not.

06:15.713 --> 06:17.278
What are you
talking about?

06:17.280 --> 06:19.048
This team's done.
And thanks to you,

06:19.050 --> 06:21.684
we're gonna be watching this whole
thing go down on fucking CNN.

06:21.686 --> 06:23.418
What I did,
I did for my family.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.187
I didn't know there was
a goddamn war coming.

06:25.189 --> 06:27.156
Oh, buddy, you and your
family, you're gonna be fine.

06:27.158 --> 06:28.757
From your cushy little office,
you're gonna be fucking fine!

06:28.759 --> 06:30.259
You think I'm gonna be
sitting on the sidelines

06:30.261 --> 06:32.562
with this shit happening,
Dill? Huh?

06:32.564 --> 06:34.329
Did you talk
to Bowers?

06:34.331 --> 06:36.802
Yeah, I did. I told him I
want back in and he said no.

06:38.203 --> 06:39.634
He won't say no to me.

06:39.636 --> 06:42.103
Tell me you didn't submit
that paperwork.

06:42.105 --> 06:43.206
No, it's on my desk.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.443
Good.

06:46.311 --> 06:49.043
If anybody
in the Middle East did this,

06:49.045 --> 06:50.646
the Fifth Group's up.

06:50.648 --> 06:54.317
Fuck yeah, bro. Fuck yeah.
I mean, we would have been.

06:54.319 --> 06:56.985
If we had a fucking captain.

06:56.987 --> 06:59.658
We'll be in this fight, boys.
You mark my words.

07:04.728 --> 07:08.833
He's in a meeting, sir.
It's a private meeting, sir.

07:33.158 --> 07:35.292
Your retirement papers?

07:36.761 --> 07:38.593
There's nothing
to submit, sir.

07:38.595 --> 07:42.298
I'm still Chief Warrant
Officer of ODA 595,

07:42.300 --> 07:44.333
and my team has
more combat experience

07:44.335 --> 07:46.735
than the rest
of Fifth Group combined.

07:46.737 --> 07:49.307
All that hell we went through
in Somalia, Desert Storm,

07:50.340 --> 07:52.975
that means somethin'.

07:52.977 --> 07:54.709
You break this team up,

07:54.711 --> 07:56.992
you're cutting the head off
your most venomous snake, sir.

07:57.816 --> 07:59.581
Yeah.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.815
Okay.

08:00.817 --> 08:02.418
I'll pull you a captain
and get you in the game.

08:02.420 --> 08:03.853
We have a captain, sir.

08:03.855 --> 08:06.055
You have a captain
with no combat experience.

08:06.057 --> 08:07.423
He's never been to war.

08:07.425 --> 08:08.824
He's only led you in training.

08:08.826 --> 08:10.492
He's already been
bumped up to staff.

08:10.494 --> 08:11.894
This is a career wrecker.

08:11.896 --> 08:13.362
You understand that, right?

08:13.364 --> 08:15.564
Well, all due respect,
I've spent two years

08:15.566 --> 08:18.132
with that fellow
leadin' our team.

08:18.134 --> 08:20.836
If you think furthering
his career is why he joined,

08:20.838 --> 08:23.774
you need to get to know
your captain, sir.

08:28.946 --> 08:30.315
As you were.

08:32.482 --> 08:36.652
- Sorry about the desk.
- No, no. It's a good kill.

08:36.654 --> 08:39.224
Besides, you're not gonna
need it where you're going.

08:53.838 --> 08:56.308
Special Forces
doesn't have thermals?

08:57.775 --> 08:59.741
Army wasn't expecting this.

08:59.743 --> 09:00.710
Yeah.

09:00.712 --> 09:02.814
Well, that makes two of us.

09:07.050 --> 09:11.323
You tell him. I'm not doing
your dirty work for you.

09:12.357 --> 09:13.625
Marsha.

09:16.594 --> 09:18.829
I'll love you
when you get back.

09:30.175 --> 09:31.443
Hey, buddy.

09:32.108 --> 09:33.644
Leaving?

09:34.811 --> 09:36.645
Yeah, I gotta go.

09:36.647 --> 09:38.315
How long?

09:39.784 --> 09:41.253
Don't know.

09:44.921 --> 09:46.257
Hey.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.329
You know I love you, right?

10:10.115 --> 10:11.547
Wow.

10:11.549 --> 10:13.249
Made it all the way
to the oven, huh, babe?

10:13.251 --> 10:15.851
Some wives cry, I clean.

10:15.853 --> 10:18.921
Hey, uh,
I was thinking...

10:18.923 --> 10:21.023
You're gonna have
all the time in the world

10:21.025 --> 10:23.558
to clean that oven
once I'm gone.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.294
And I'm kind of running
out of time. So...

10:26.296 --> 10:29.932
Yeah, and I bet I know
just how you wanna spend it.

10:29.934 --> 10:32.634
I mean, I have two hours.
I'll be really quick.

10:32.636 --> 10:34.637
- Super quick.
- Uh-huh, yeah, not a chance.

10:34.639 --> 10:35.937
Holding out is the only way

10:35.939 --> 10:37.773
I can guarantee
you come back to me.

10:37.775 --> 10:39.707
- Please?
- Mmm-mmm.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.476
- Just the tip.
- Mmm-mmm.

10:42.814 --> 10:44.647
- Okay, you know what?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:44.649 --> 10:46.048
War's gonna be over so quick.

10:46.050 --> 10:47.716
It's gonna be over
in like a week.

10:47.718 --> 10:49.920
I promise.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.455
Go wake up the kids.

10:53.457 --> 10:55.724
Spend the time with them.

10:55.726 --> 10:58.797
I know what I signed up for.
They don't.

11:26.156 --> 11:29.360
Don't wish for what
you don't want.

11:32.329 --> 11:36.999
You were on a flight
to New York two months ago.

11:37.001 --> 11:40.369
You don't have
to justify it to me.

11:40.371 --> 11:43.239
I'm a soldier's wife.

11:43.241 --> 11:45.774
And I've been lucky.

11:45.776 --> 11:48.809
All I've had
to worry about so far

11:48.811 --> 11:51.846
is malaria
and chopper crashes.

11:51.848 --> 11:54.551
Most dangerous part's
the ride in and out.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.822
Not anymore.

12:01.726 --> 12:05.326
I don't care
how long you're gone

12:05.328 --> 12:07.766
as long as you come back.

12:09.366 --> 12:11.267
You understand?

12:11.269 --> 12:13.138
Yeah, I do.

12:15.707 --> 12:20.075
Then say you're coming home.

12:20.077 --> 12:22.914
I can't, baby.
It's bad luck.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.554
I need to hear you say it.

12:33.524 --> 12:35.660
I'm comin' home.

13:05.756 --> 13:08.990
Hey, ODA 595.
Where do we bunk?

13:08.992 --> 13:10.692
Uh, you see
those Quonset huts?

13:10.694 --> 13:11.960
Those are for the teams.

13:11.962 --> 13:13.997
ODA numbers
are on the door, sir.

13:15.165 --> 13:16.898
Don't salute in country.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.667
Are you trying to get
our captain killed, bro?

13:18.669 --> 13:20.269
These are all friendlies.

13:20.271 --> 13:21.637
Oh, yeah?

13:21.639 --> 13:23.505
Who, that guy?
That's not my friend.

13:23.507 --> 13:25.441
And that guy's
definitely not my friend.

13:25.443 --> 13:26.874
Fucking Diller, bro.

13:26.876 --> 13:28.476
I could be their friend.
He looks nice.

13:28.478 --> 13:29.611
That guy?

13:29.613 --> 13:30.915
Yeah.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.716
Heads up. Heads up.

13:35.386 --> 13:38.186
What's up, guys? Looks like
Christmas came early, huh?

13:38.188 --> 13:40.822
Oh, yeah. Ho, ho, ho.
Where have you guys been?

13:40.824 --> 13:42.658
Oh, we went to
a fucking Nickelback concert.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.493
How was it?
Throw your panties on stage?

13:44.495 --> 13:46.695
Nah, nah, nah, we got stuck
in a holding position

13:46.697 --> 13:48.263
- till the weather broke.
- From what I hear,

13:48.265 --> 13:49.898
the weather here
doesn't change until June.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.499
Snowed last night.
So get used to it.

13:51.501 --> 13:52.833
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

13:52.835 --> 13:54.370
Hey, what's all this?

13:54.372 --> 13:56.839
Someone gave the quartermaster
a Gold Card.

13:56.841 --> 13:58.940
Now, the only unit

13:58.942 --> 14:01.110
with any cold weather tac-gear is the
10th Mountain. They ain't sharing.

14:01.112 --> 14:02.812
Make sure
everyone carries a GPS.

14:02.814 --> 14:04.812
I couldn't find one topo map
of this place.

14:04.814 --> 14:08.049
- Copy that, Captain.
- Hey, look what 515 left outside their tents.

14:08.051 --> 14:10.686
- -Hey, guys, quiet down.
Oh, it's Britney Spears!

14:10.688 --> 14:12.087
Five months in country,

14:12.089 --> 14:13.889
this hair is what
you're getting, man.

14:13.891 --> 14:15.291
Hey, man. Is that a wig?
Can I touch it? Just one time.

14:15.293 --> 14:17.993
Ask Coffers' wife, man.
She loves it.

14:17.995 --> 14:19.461
Oh!

14:19.463 --> 14:21.797
Cap said grow it out, guys.
What happened? What happened?

14:21.799 --> 14:24.968
Whoa! Whoa! Be careful!
Vern knows Krav Maga!

14:26.002 --> 14:27.903
Don't even think about...

14:34.011 --> 14:36.678
All right, pencils down.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.681
The other five teams
have been interviewed.

14:38.683 --> 14:42.317
And, Cap, we're all countin'
on you, so, you know,

14:42.319 --> 14:44.552
- no pressure.
- Thanks, buddy.

14:44.554 --> 14:45.854
See you soon, boys.

14:45.856 --> 14:48.826
Yep. Give 'em hell, Cap.

14:53.363 --> 14:56.264
Bin Laden has been financing
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda,

14:56.266 --> 15:00.802
setting up terrorist training
camps all over Afghanistan.

15:00.804 --> 15:03.205
He's had one big win
on U.S. soil.

15:03.207 --> 15:04.974
He wants another.

15:04.976 --> 15:07.842
And if we don't stop him,
there will be more.

15:07.844 --> 15:11.047
Bin Laden might be the brains,
but make no mistake about it,

15:11.049 --> 15:14.482
in Afghanistan,
the Taliban is the muscle.

15:14.484 --> 15:16.985
If we remove them
from power,

15:16.987 --> 15:19.254
he can't use them
to make his attacks.

15:19.256 --> 15:21.123
Mazar-i-Sharif.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.793
Whoever controls that city,
controls Afghanistan.

15:23.795 --> 15:26.061
If we take Mazar
from the Taliban,

15:26.063 --> 15:28.697
then we cripple Bin Laden.

15:28.699 --> 15:30.999
Well, that's half-right.

15:31.001 --> 15:32.333
If you're gonna interrupt me,

15:32.335 --> 15:34.537
you should probably
be entirely right.

15:34.539 --> 15:37.038
No, we aren't taking anything.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.508
The man who's gonna take Mazar
is named General Dostum.

15:39.510 --> 15:42.077
He's an Afghan warlord
with the Northern Alliance.

15:42.079 --> 15:44.813
He has the troops, he has the
intel, he knows the cliffs.

15:44.815 --> 15:47.883
He knows every cave
and most importantly,

15:47.885 --> 15:49.818
he does not care
for the Taliban.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.622
So this is about airstrikes?

15:52.622 --> 15:54.355
Sorry, sir.

15:54.357 --> 15:55.856
No, you nailed that one.

15:55.858 --> 15:58.427
Dostum cannot take out
the Taliban by himself.

15:58.429 --> 15:59.861
Here's the plan.

15:59.863 --> 16:02.029
We're gonna drop you into
Northern Afghanistan.

16:02.031 --> 16:04.600
There, you will meet up
with a CIA operative

16:04.602 --> 16:06.601
who will take you to Dostum.

16:06.603 --> 16:08.303
Your mission,

16:08.305 --> 16:10.371
earn Dostum's trust,

16:10.373 --> 16:12.173
embed with his militia,

16:12.175 --> 16:15.211
you fight alongside him while he makes
his way to Taliban strongholds.

16:15.213 --> 16:18.679
When you get there, you call in
for close air support strikes.

16:18.681 --> 16:20.014
Dostum will do the rest.

16:20.016 --> 16:22.484
One by one,
stronghold by stronghold,

16:22.486 --> 16:25.520
until he takes Mazar,
and the Taliban falls.

16:25.522 --> 16:27.688
You got six weeks.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.591
I'd say three weeks, sir.

16:29.593 --> 16:32.059
- God damn it.
- No, no.

16:32.061 --> 16:34.361
All right, I'll bite.

16:34.363 --> 16:36.097
Why three?

16:36.099 --> 16:38.332
The Russians have been here before, right?
They've done this.

16:38.334 --> 16:39.701
And they wrote about it.

16:39.703 --> 16:41.269
They said the snow
was shutting down

16:41.271 --> 16:44.072
all the mountain passes
by mid-November.

16:44.074 --> 16:46.041
Every year, without fail.

16:46.043 --> 16:47.842
Now, if the Russians are
talking about a bad winter,

16:47.844 --> 16:49.977
it's usually worth
paying attention to, isn't it?

16:49.979 --> 16:52.514
After three weeks,
we will not get into Mazar.

16:52.516 --> 16:56.951
That snow will hit, the Taliban will
dig in, and my men won't come home.

16:56.953 --> 16:59.721
Your air support comes
from B-52s at 35,000 feet.

16:59.723 --> 17:02.057
How do you think you're gonna
get close enough to be accurate

17:02.059 --> 17:03.491
without parking a bomb
in your lap?

17:03.493 --> 17:04.992
I'll have to get
out of the way, sir.

17:06.563 --> 17:08.762
The extra three weeks
is cushion for your fuck-ups.

17:08.765 --> 17:10.665
There won't be any fuck-ups.
Three weeks is all we need.

17:10.666 --> 17:13.836
Pretty confident for a guy
who's never done this before.

17:13.838 --> 17:15.269
Never been to war.

17:15.271 --> 17:18.039
I don't see that
as a disadvantage, sir.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.008
Well, maybe you should
explain that.

17:20.010 --> 17:23.112
We're teaming up with a warlord
that we know nothing about.

17:23.114 --> 17:25.512
We're not gonna be able to tell
our enemies from our allies.

17:25.515 --> 17:29.616
Every step we take is gonna be on a
minefield from a hundred different wars.

17:29.618 --> 17:32.653
And no one's ever called in a
smart bomb airstrike from a B-52.

17:32.655 --> 17:35.024
So anyone who tells you
they've done this before

17:35.026 --> 17:37.092
or has experience in this
is lying, sir.

17:37.094 --> 17:40.596
There's no playbook here. We're
gonna have to write it ourselves.

17:40.598 --> 17:44.865
I briefed five potential
captains for this mission.

17:44.867 --> 17:48.839
About a hundred years of military
experience between them.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.342
But you're the only one
that sees it the way it is.

17:54.344 --> 17:58.380
I choose you.
You and 11 men.

17:58.382 --> 18:00.115
Task Force Dagger.

18:00.117 --> 18:02.584
I would be remiss
if I did not say to you,

18:02.586 --> 18:04.786
even in success

18:04.788 --> 18:06.253
the odds of you coming home...

18:06.255 --> 18:09.525
They're 100%, sir,
with all due respect.

18:09.527 --> 18:11.893
See, I kind of made
a promise, too.

18:11.895 --> 18:13.261
You know better
than that, Nelson.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.797
- What'd she get you to?
- Christmas.

18:15.799 --> 18:17.332
Hmm.

18:17.334 --> 18:19.701
It's a hell of a thing
we do, isn't it?

18:19.703 --> 18:24.073
How do you love your family
and leave them to go to war?

18:24.075 --> 18:27.843
You're wheels up at 2200.
Dismissed.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.548
No, no. Knock that off. Go.

18:31.548 --> 18:33.351
Captain.

18:36.019 --> 18:40.223
The most important thing a man can
take into combat is a reason why.

18:42.091 --> 18:44.558
This is from the towers.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.461
You carry that with you.

18:47.463 --> 18:50.532
Five weeks ago,
19 men attacked our country.

18:50.534 --> 18:54.504
The 12 of you will be the
first ones to fight back.

18:56.507 --> 18:57.672
Go win this thing.

18:57.674 --> 18:59.443
Thank you, sir.

19:03.513 --> 19:05.146
Yeah!

19:05.148 --> 19:07.048
Son of a bitch.
We're the first ones in!

19:07.050 --> 19:09.250
Yeah, it's kind of like
the Apollo program.

19:09.252 --> 19:11.220
You know what they sent
into space first, right?

19:11.222 --> 19:12.621
- What?
- A monkey.

19:12.623 --> 19:13.755
Great.

19:13.757 --> 19:16.124
But, listen, brother.

19:16.126 --> 19:17.759
If it's six weeks,
it's six weeks, okay?

19:17.761 --> 19:19.428
We can't rush this.

19:19.430 --> 19:21.628
We're in harm's way
no matter what the weather.

19:21.630 --> 19:24.566
If your only goal
is trying to keep us alive,

19:24.568 --> 19:26.000
we're dead men for sure.

19:26.002 --> 19:28.936
I ain't losing one man
on this team, Hal.

19:28.938 --> 19:30.907
The only way home is winning.

19:32.909 --> 19:34.675
Well, shit, I believe you.

19:34.677 --> 19:37.945
Come on, let's tell the boys
we're up.

19:47.724 --> 19:50.192
Oh, my God!

19:50.194 --> 19:52.493
This woman
was stoned to death

19:52.495 --> 19:54.363
for being pregnant
out of wedlock.

19:54.365 --> 19:57.132
This is what the Taliban
does to women in Afghanistan.

19:57.134 --> 19:59.934
Oh, God,
just shut that shit off.

19:59.936 --> 20:01.470
It's what they gave us
for intel.

20:01.472 --> 20:03.305
But that's not intel,
that's motivation.

20:03.307 --> 20:04.906
And I got two towers
full of that.

20:04.908 --> 20:06.575
Ah, you don't need
to study, Falls.

20:06.577 --> 20:08.609
You just shoot the guy
shooting at you.

20:08.611 --> 20:10.945
Oh, is that how that works? Thank
you very much, Mr. Wizard.

20:10.947 --> 20:13.048
Hey, look, Michaels. It's you.

20:13.050 --> 20:14.949
Jesus Christ,
you guys are jealous.

20:14.951 --> 20:17.752
What do you call that? Is it
like a coif or something?

20:17.754 --> 20:19.954
- Guys. Guys, guys.
- I don't do bad hair.

20:19.956 --> 20:21.957
Listen up!

20:21.959 --> 20:23.394
All right, boys.

20:26.030 --> 20:27.395
It's us, we're going in.

20:27.397 --> 20:28.998
Yeah!

20:29.000 --> 20:30.464
We beat out
the five other teams.

20:30.466 --> 20:32.267
We're gonna drop in
behind enemy lines,

20:32.269 --> 20:34.701
link up with a warlord
of the Northern Alliance,

20:34.703 --> 20:36.336
General Abdul Dostum.

20:36.338 --> 20:38.506
We'll assist him
in fighting the Taliban

20:38.508 --> 20:41.210
and taking back the city
of Mazar-i-Sharif,

20:41.212 --> 20:43.045
which happens to be
the stronghold and linchpin

20:43.047 --> 20:45.247
for the entire
northern Taliban force.

20:45.249 --> 20:47.449
Now if we don't take
that city,

20:47.451 --> 20:49.084
the whole country
will turn into

20:49.086 --> 20:50.751
a goddamn terrorist
training camp.

20:50.753 --> 20:52.653
World Trade Center's
just the beginning.

20:52.655 --> 20:54.489
They're not finished
with us yet.

20:54.491 --> 20:57.358
The catch is,
we only have 21 days.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.126
How many troops does he have?

20:59.128 --> 21:00.695
He's got about
200 paid soldiers

21:00.697 --> 21:02.964
and an undetermined number
of part-time militia.

21:02.966 --> 21:04.199
What about
the other side?

21:04.201 --> 21:06.734
The other side
has about 50,000

21:06.736 --> 21:08.303
Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters.

21:08.305 --> 21:10.305
Missiles, armor, rockets,

21:10.307 --> 21:12.106
mortars, machine guns.

21:12.108 --> 21:13.674
We're outnumbered.

21:13.676 --> 21:15.176
Just 5,000 to one.

21:15.178 --> 21:16.711
It's what I call
a target-rich environment.

21:16.713 --> 21:18.346
I kind of like those odds,
to be honest.

21:18.348 --> 21:19.980
Now, gentlemen,

21:19.982 --> 21:22.049
once we land, we're about
nine hours away from help.

21:22.051 --> 21:25.388
Which effectively means it doesn't exist.
We're on our own.

21:26.623 --> 21:28.691
We all need to understand

21:28.693 --> 21:30.825
that capture is not
an option here.

21:30.827 --> 21:33.127
We've all seen the intel
on what the Taliban does

21:33.129 --> 21:35.130
to their prisoners, correct?

21:35.132 --> 21:37.165
Those motherfuckers
will make you suffer.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.734
- Shit goes south, I'm dying with my boots on.
- Amen.

21:39.736 --> 21:41.470
- As am I.
- Hear, hear.

21:41.472 --> 21:44.306
We go in tonight.
Single ship, no backup.

21:44.308 --> 21:46.942
So police your gear,
get some rest.

21:46.944 --> 21:48.611
Had a successful test flight?

21:49.646 --> 21:51.648
We are the test flight.

22:38.061 --> 22:40.295
If you die,

22:40.297 --> 22:44.499
that's a letter you and your
wife are gonna wish you wrote.

22:44.501 --> 22:48.436
I just made her
a promise I'm coming home.

22:48.438 --> 22:51.341
I ain't writing her a letter
that says I broke it.

23:10.661 --> 23:13.127
We got one, two,

23:13.129 --> 23:15.730
three, four,

23:15.732 --> 23:17.899
five, six...

23:17.901 --> 23:20.035
I guess that space suit
answers the question

23:20.037 --> 23:21.970
about closing
the freaking doors.

23:21.972 --> 23:23.505
What's your cruising altitude?

23:23.507 --> 23:25.207
That's a good question.

23:25.209 --> 23:27.241
Well, it must be
above 10,000 feet

23:27.243 --> 23:28.911
if you're using O2.

23:28.913 --> 23:30.846
Shit, the mountains we're
flying over are 10,000 feet.

23:30.848 --> 23:32.713
The sandstorms would
ruin the engines

23:32.715 --> 23:34.882
and missiles have been fired
from the peaks.

23:34.884 --> 23:36.718
Well, that puts us at 20.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.253
You can't fly a Chinook
at 20,000 feet.

23:39.255 --> 23:40.454
We're not gonna.

23:40.456 --> 23:42.089
Flight altitude's 25.

23:42.091 --> 23:43.391
Oh.

23:43.393 --> 23:45.292
Well,
how's this thing take it?

23:45.294 --> 23:46.760
We'll find out.

23:46.762 --> 23:48.363
Is there O2 for my team?

23:48.365 --> 23:49.897
We got masks in the
back, but they don't work.

23:49.899 --> 23:51.400
Hell, ours didn't work
last flight.

23:51.402 --> 23:52.733
This dipshit started
seeing bogeymen.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.903
Almost crashed into
the damn mountain.

23:54.905 --> 23:57.705
Oh, shit.
We're gonna go hypoxic.

23:57.707 --> 23:58.940
Not me.

23:58.942 --> 24:00.942
Keeping my eyes
on that fucker right there.

24:00.944 --> 24:02.778
We're going to the clouds,
gentlemen.

24:02.780 --> 24:05.980
No one's ever flown a chopper
this high this far.

24:05.982 --> 24:07.548
Strap in tight!

24:07.550 --> 24:10.285
- I've never been hypoxic before.
- Really?

24:10.287 --> 24:11.819
Oh, it's great.

24:11.821 --> 24:13.587
All you do is faint.

24:13.589 --> 24:15.089
Think of it as
a nine-hour nap.

24:15.091 --> 24:17.491
It's not the going to sleep
that worries me.

24:17.493 --> 24:19.994
It's the goddamn hangover
on the other side.

24:19.996 --> 24:21.762
Yeah, baby!

24:21.764 --> 24:24.499
- Well, you know why the Army uses Chinooks, right?
- Why?

24:24.501 --> 24:27.201
So we'll be good and mad
when we get into battle.

24:28.771 --> 24:31.506
I know, man!
I'm a laugh factory!

24:31.508 --> 24:34.578
Mission equipment
is set. EOS, flare, chaff.

24:35.611 --> 24:38.581
595, we are clear for takeoff.

24:39.950 --> 24:43.719
<i>Silver wings upon their chest</i>

24:43.721 --> 24:45.886
<i>These are men</i>

24:45.888 --> 24:47.721
<i>America's best</i>

24:47.723 --> 24:51.792
<i>One hundred men
we'll test today</i>

24:51.794 --> 24:55.963
<i>But only three win
the Green Beret</i>

25:24.028 --> 25:26.394
<i>Hey, 595, this is 1213.</i>

25:26.396 --> 25:28.531
<i>Visibility is deteriorating.</i>

25:37.540 --> 25:39.876
<i>We're turning back,
blind alley.</i>

26:06.203 --> 26:07.937
<i>Hang on! We're descending.</i>

26:09.839 --> 26:11.640
On purpose?

26:11.642 --> 26:13.474
<i>- On purpose?
- Roger that.</i>

26:13.476 --> 26:15.509
- <i>Wheels down, two minutes.</i>
- Two minutes!

26:15.511 --> 26:17.947
- Two minutes!
- Wake up!

26:23.520 --> 26:25.823
Jock up, NODs on!

26:35.132 --> 26:37.397
<i>Right gunner has
landing area in sight.</i>

26:37.399 --> 26:38.935
Going in hot.

26:40.104 --> 26:41.970
Here we go!

26:41.972 --> 26:45.009
<i>Fifteen, ten, nine, eight.
Hold your forward.</i>

26:45.942 --> 26:47.377
<i>Bring it down.</i>

26:48.578 --> 26:50.511
<i>Cleared on left,
cleared on right.</i>

26:50.513 --> 26:52.445
<i>On five, four, three.
Ramps cleared down.</i>

26:52.447 --> 26:53.850
<i>Ramp, ramp, ramp.</i>

27:46.603 --> 27:49.569
Hey. There.

27:49.571 --> 27:50.971
See those two fellas?

27:50.973 --> 27:52.973
Yeah.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.042
- Is this our escort?
- No, I don't think so.

27:55.044 --> 27:56.778
We're supposed to be
meeting a squad.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.749
I don't think
these are our guys.

28:16.031 --> 28:18.199
Shut them up.
We got company.

28:20.169 --> 28:21.502
Shit!

28:21.504 --> 28:23.506
Put your fucking
weapons down!

28:24.573 --> 28:25.774
Drop your weapons!

28:28.278 --> 28:30.511
No! No! No! Friendlies!

28:30.513 --> 28:31.781
Friendlies! Stand down!

28:32.715 --> 28:34.016
All right, weapons down!

28:36.152 --> 28:38.385
Let them up.
That's your fucking escort.

28:38.387 --> 28:40.221
Let them up.

28:43.694 --> 28:45.859
We're sorry.

28:49.899 --> 28:52.001
Right. Okay.

28:53.770 --> 28:56.070
If you could just tell him
we apologize?

29:02.245 --> 29:03.478
You team leader?

29:03.480 --> 29:04.711
Yeah, I am. You guys are late.

29:04.713 --> 29:06.646
Well, we're here now.

29:06.648 --> 29:07.982
You don't speak Dari?

29:07.984 --> 29:09.549
- Not at all.
- How's your Uzbek?

29:09.551 --> 29:11.185
So-so.
My Russian's decent.

29:11.187 --> 29:12.920
All right. Well, Russian
will get you through.

29:12.922 --> 29:14.422
We should move,
it's a long hike.

29:14.424 --> 29:16.024
They dumped you in a bad spot.

29:16.026 --> 29:18.124
Let's go, grab your gear.
Let's move.

29:19.562 --> 29:20.662
Hey!

29:20.664 --> 29:22.230
Back up! No! No!

29:22.232 --> 29:23.530
Yo, yo, yo.

29:28.337 --> 29:29.973
Yeah, thank you.

30:05.442 --> 30:07.241
This is it.

30:07.243 --> 30:09.277
They call it the Alamo.

30:09.279 --> 30:10.810
Got you set up in here.

30:10.812 --> 30:12.579
Why don't you guys
take first watch.

30:12.581 --> 30:14.816
Rotate every two hours.
Head on a swivel.

30:14.818 --> 30:16.686
- Roger that.
- On it.

30:18.221 --> 30:21.888
You know everyone died
in the Alamo, right?

30:21.890 --> 30:24.227
I think you should
keep that to yourself.

30:28.999 --> 30:31.465
Oh, this is great.

30:31.467 --> 30:33.500
Yeah, this is gonna go over
real well in a Muslim country.

30:33.502 --> 30:36.540
It ain't our job to choose
the gifts, man. It's yours.

30:38.175 --> 30:39.539
Come on in.

30:39.541 --> 30:41.675
This is your new home.

30:41.677 --> 30:43.411
Hey, feel free to eat
any of that.

30:43.413 --> 30:45.680
The bread's good. I don't
know what this is,

30:45.682 --> 30:47.414
but it's fucking great.

30:47.416 --> 30:48.883
Give me the lay of the land.

30:48.885 --> 30:50.585
What kind of intel you got?

30:50.587 --> 30:52.487
Well, here's what
I know, and it ain't much.

30:52.489 --> 30:53.921
What's left
of the Northern Alliance

30:53.923 --> 30:56.290
is essentially
three separate militias.

30:56.292 --> 30:58.392
All right? That are all
enemies with each other.

30:58.394 --> 31:01.362
General Dostum, General Atta,
and General Mohaqiq.

31:01.364 --> 31:03.999
So you got a three-pronged
attack that doesn't communicate,

31:04.001 --> 31:05.634
will not assist each other.

31:05.636 --> 31:07.134
And if they meet
on the battlefield,

31:07.136 --> 31:08.803
they'll probably stop fighting
the Taliban

31:08.805 --> 31:10.171
and start killing each other.

31:10.173 --> 31:12.440
What about our contact,
General Dostum?

31:12.442 --> 31:14.843
General Abdul Rashid Dostum.

31:14.845 --> 31:17.112
Okay, he's Uzbek.

31:17.114 --> 31:20.882
Started fighting the Russians
when he was 16. He's 55 now.

31:20.884 --> 31:23.017
Yeah, we have his bio.
What's he like?

31:23.019 --> 31:24.852
What's he like?

31:24.854 --> 31:27.388
Yeah, what's he like? His personality.
Angry, happy, sad?

31:27.390 --> 31:28.722
He likes show tunes.

31:28.724 --> 31:30.258
He likes show tunes.
Great.

31:30.260 --> 31:31.893
Look, I read people
for a living,

31:31.895 --> 31:33.627
and I can't get a bead
on this guy.

31:33.629 --> 31:36.029
Okay? Only two things
I know for sure.

31:36.031 --> 31:39.333
He hates the Taliban and they
hate the shit out of him.

31:39.335 --> 31:41.869
How worried should we be
about any of these guys

31:41.871 --> 31:43.505
trying to sell us
to the Taliban?

31:43.507 --> 31:46.441
Uh, I'd be pretty fucking
worried, if I was you.

31:46.443 --> 31:47.807
Right.

31:47.809 --> 31:49.743
- Does Dostum speak English?
- No.

31:49.745 --> 31:51.746
He speaks Tajik.

31:51.748 --> 31:53.247
He speaks Uzbek.

31:53.249 --> 31:54.615
He speaks Dari.

31:54.617 --> 31:57.417
He speaks Pashtun, which is
what the Taliban speak.

31:57.419 --> 32:00.488
And he speaks Russian.
So you got that going for ya.

32:00.490 --> 32:01.955
Are you with us through this?

32:01.957 --> 32:03.490
No, I'm leaving
right now.

32:03.492 --> 32:04.925
I got a 50 kilometer hike

32:04.927 --> 32:06.760
to give a bag of money
to another warlord.

32:06.762 --> 32:09.964
Who knows, maybe we'll see
each other on the battlefield.

32:09.966 --> 32:11.231
If we do,

32:11.233 --> 32:14.000
don't shoot the guy
in the backwards cap.

32:14.002 --> 32:15.838
We'll keep that in mind.

32:19.509 --> 32:21.608
God, that spook is cheery.

32:21.610 --> 32:24.811
Yeah, runnin' around here
alone, setting this thing up?

32:24.813 --> 32:26.946
Say one thing about him,

32:26.948 --> 32:29.018
he's got giant balls.

32:30.787 --> 32:32.122
Hey.

32:33.455 --> 32:35.455
- So where is he?
- Who?

32:35.457 --> 32:37.991
- Dostum.
- No clue.

32:37.993 --> 32:40.027
He knows
we're here though, right?

32:40.029 --> 32:43.000
Whole fucking country knows
you're here.

32:45.033 --> 32:47.101
Best of luck, Captain.

32:47.103 --> 32:48.435
I mean it.

32:48.437 --> 32:49.604
You too.

32:49.606 --> 32:51.273
Give 'em hell.

33:07.924 --> 33:10.290
Come look at this.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.594
Graveyard of Empires,

33:12.596 --> 33:15.563
and we're in it.

33:15.565 --> 33:19.099
Shows you how unlucky it is
to write on that wall,

33:19.101 --> 33:21.271
so no one better do it.

33:29.878 --> 33:31.612
Hey, Cap.

33:31.614 --> 33:32.980
Get some rest, all right?

33:32.982 --> 33:34.448
Something ain't right here.

33:34.450 --> 33:36.483
Now, look.

33:36.485 --> 33:39.319
This is about being smart,
not super human.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.522
Yeah, I know, I know.

33:41.524 --> 33:43.893
I'm gonna take the next watch.

33:46.796 --> 33:48.663
Massoud.

33:48.665 --> 33:51.934
When he died, the Northern
Alliance might have died with him.

34:14.056 --> 34:16.359
Move! Move!

34:17.993 --> 34:20.362
That Dostum?

34:50.458 --> 34:52.692
General.

34:52.694 --> 34:54.293
Peace be with you.

35:05.175 --> 35:07.341
And what did he say?

35:07.343 --> 35:10.343
He said it's good
to know the language of your enemies.

35:29.131 --> 35:30.798
Am I doing this alone?

35:30.800 --> 35:32.066
All right, let's go.

35:32.068 --> 35:33.968
Looks like Spencer
got a promotion.

35:33.970 --> 35:35.903
I guess he prefers brunettes.

35:35.905 --> 35:38.274
Yeah, seems that way, huh?

35:56.591 --> 35:59.061
All right, why don't we
give him the gift?

36:18.048 --> 36:19.415
Mmm.

36:24.754 --> 36:26.287
What did he say?

36:26.289 --> 36:28.122
I don't think
the horse feed's a big hit.

36:28.124 --> 36:31.292
- Well, that went over like a bag of shit.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:31.294 --> 36:33.263
You wanna try
the vodka, Captain?

36:39.901 --> 36:41.338
General.

36:56.718 --> 36:59.155
To our new American friends.

37:03.593 --> 37:08.029
I hope they don't think
they win copying the Russians.

37:08.031 --> 37:10.098
I was told
you didn't speak English.

37:10.100 --> 37:13.203
I didn't speak to the man
who told you I don't.

37:15.004 --> 37:16.703
Where are my bombs?

37:16.705 --> 37:19.640
General, I have more bombs
than you could ever want.

37:19.642 --> 37:22.377
- Could you show me the Taliban's location?
- Why the young one speak?

37:22.379 --> 37:24.879
He's our captain, sir.

37:27.482 --> 37:29.883
- Tell them to stand down.
- Hey, Diller.

37:36.758 --> 37:40.428
General, I'm the captain.
This is my team.

37:40.430 --> 37:43.464
You speak to me, all right?

37:43.466 --> 37:45.466
- This is my country.
- I understand that.

37:45.468 --> 37:48.935
You own the land,
but we own the sky.

37:48.937 --> 37:51.140
You want our bombs,
talk to me.

37:52.542 --> 37:53.941
Okay.

37:53.943 --> 37:55.908
We talk.

37:55.910 --> 37:59.345
Why these men follow you?

37:59.347 --> 38:01.381
I could ask you
the same question.

38:01.383 --> 38:03.452
You don't want the answer.

38:04.653 --> 38:05.722
Look.

38:06.589 --> 38:08.725
Look. Those eyes.

38:09.626 --> 38:11.261
Killer eyes.

38:15.731 --> 38:17.198
Those eyes.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.667
Killer eyes.

38:20.035 --> 38:21.903
Yes.

38:21.905 --> 38:23.573
Killer eyes.

38:24.540 --> 38:27.544
What did you kill?

38:29.010 --> 38:30.511
You wanna see me kill?

38:30.513 --> 38:33.249
You take me to the Taliban,
I'll show you.

38:37.553 --> 38:39.689
Okay. We go.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.425
That was easy.

38:45.894 --> 38:48.162
Buddy, you better check
that fucking swagger

38:48.164 --> 38:50.064
before he sells us
to the highest bidder.

38:50.066 --> 38:53.366
Listen, he needed to know how far
I can be pushed. Now he does.

38:53.368 --> 38:55.504
Fucking killer's eyes.

38:59.508 --> 39:02.411
General. General, how far
away is the Taliban?

39:03.479 --> 39:07.448
Five hours.
I have horses for you.

39:07.450 --> 39:10.587
- There's only six. I need 12. I got 12 men.
- I have six.

39:12.589 --> 39:13.955
Hey, Cap.

39:13.957 --> 39:16.059
Looks like he's not done
pushing you.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.692
I don't like
splitting up the team, Hal.

39:19.694 --> 39:21.763
Well, it was bound to happen sooner
or later, might as well be now.

39:21.765 --> 39:23.596
At least
he's willing to fight.

39:23.598 --> 39:26.403
I figured he'd just milk us
for supplies and money.

39:28.604 --> 39:32.372
Can you show me on the map
exactly where we're going?

39:32.374 --> 39:34.710
Cobaki. Over the mountains.

39:36.780 --> 39:39.245
All right, Diller,
Coffers, Michaels,

39:39.247 --> 39:40.881
Bennett, Jackson,
you're with me.

39:40.883 --> 39:43.386
Falls, Black, grab the
daypacks, extra ammo.

39:45.120 --> 39:48.823
I took Dehi four days ago
from Taliban.

39:48.825 --> 39:51.491
Mullah Razzan,
leader of the Taliban,

39:51.493 --> 39:53.560
has a high price
on your heads.

39:53.562 --> 39:57.464
100,000 US dollars
for your body.

39:57.466 --> 40:00.133
50,000 for your
bloody uniforms.

40:00.135 --> 40:01.470
That's it?

40:03.606 --> 40:05.038
A little low.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.540
Toss a little change out,
Taliban.

40:06.542 --> 40:08.475
Well,
look on the bright side.

40:08.477 --> 40:09.910
If his plan was to cash us in,

40:09.912 --> 40:11.745
he'd find another
six horses for sure.

40:11.747 --> 40:13.479
I guarantee it.

40:13.481 --> 40:16.116
All right, who's ridden before?
Anyone?

40:16.118 --> 40:17.651
Summer camp,
when I was nine.

40:17.653 --> 40:21.220
Cancun, spring break.
But I was pretty drunk.

40:21.222 --> 40:22.388
I can't ride for shit.

40:22.390 --> 40:24.024
Okay,
so that's nobody.

40:24.026 --> 40:27.329
But, hey, this will be fun.
All right.

40:29.531 --> 40:32.966
Okay, so a kick means "go."
This is the steering wheel.

40:32.968 --> 40:34.533
Left to go left,

40:34.535 --> 40:36.803
- right to go right. Pull back to stop.
- Okay.

40:36.805 --> 40:38.939
He's not waiting for us.
Saddle up.

40:38.941 --> 40:40.908
I'll start
a supply chain, okay?

40:40.910 --> 40:42.375
Schedule a drop.

40:42.377 --> 40:43.810
Does it have a name?

40:43.812 --> 40:45.111
Request ammo
for Dostum's men.

40:45.113 --> 40:46.513
I know,
but does it have a name?

40:46.515 --> 40:47.714
And Michaels will be
on the radio.

40:47.716 --> 40:49.249
We'll check in
every four hours.

40:49.251 --> 40:50.383
He's gonna test you.

40:50.385 --> 40:51.752
Yeah. I'm gonna test him, too.

40:51.754 --> 40:53.888
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

40:53.890 --> 40:56.756
About to find out.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.826
Oh, fuck. God damn it.

40:59.828 --> 41:01.194
Good luck, boys.

41:01.196 --> 41:03.497
You guys look like
a bunch of naturals.

41:03.499 --> 41:05.098
Don't break
the horse, Dill.

41:05.100 --> 41:06.301
Shit.

44:28.336 --> 44:31.473
I don't like how
they're looking at us, Cap.

44:33.042 --> 44:35.778
Cap, we got three AK's and
a spotter at three o'clock.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.682
Yeah, I see it.

44:44.986 --> 44:46.486
What the fuck
are we stopping for?

44:46.488 --> 44:48.055
I don't know.

44:52.093 --> 44:53.526
Supplies.

44:53.528 --> 44:55.328
Yeah, well,
we're sitting ducks here.

44:55.330 --> 44:57.029
You gotta be
kidding me.

44:57.031 --> 44:59.732
Risking our asses
for 10 gallons of water.

44:59.734 --> 45:01.769
No,
he's showing us off.

45:01.771 --> 45:03.504
He's saying,
"Look at the Americans.

45:03.506 --> 45:04.741
"They're here with me."

45:19.421 --> 45:21.354
Hey, don't fucking look down!

45:21.356 --> 45:23.055
Where you look,
the horse goes.

45:23.057 --> 45:24.691
Move your head,
it shifts your weight

45:24.693 --> 45:27.093
and shifts the horse's weight.
Got it?

45:27.095 --> 45:28.897
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

45:48.350 --> 45:50.685
- Hey, boss.
- Yeah.

45:52.220 --> 45:54.386
He's got us on the north side
of this range.

45:54.388 --> 45:55.754
I'm guessing that isn't good.

45:55.756 --> 45:57.558
No. Commo satellites orbit
to the south.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.192
There's no way
I'm gonna get any signal

45:59.194 --> 46:00.593
through that mountain range.

46:00.595 --> 46:01.694
I'm gonna have to go up
on the plateau

46:01.696 --> 46:03.062
and try to get better contact.

46:03.064 --> 46:05.832
He's got us camping
in a dead spot.

46:05.834 --> 46:07.567
You think he knows
it's a dead spot?

46:07.569 --> 46:11.370
I know every cell phone
dead zone in my hometown.

46:11.372 --> 46:12.906
No GPS either, huh?

46:12.908 --> 46:15.211
No, it's pretty shitty.

46:20.649 --> 46:23.716
Your men are too slow.

46:23.718 --> 46:26.955
We will kill the Taliban
in the morning.

46:37.531 --> 46:39.332
I see you.

46:39.334 --> 46:41.470
Yeah, I know it. I see that.

46:42.303 --> 46:44.169
That's a cool musket.

46:46.175 --> 46:49.875
Najeeb? Cool, I'm gonna take
a piss now, so...

46:49.877 --> 46:53.216
No, no. No.
Like to do this alone, bro.

46:54.415 --> 46:56.618
Respect the culture.

46:57.919 --> 47:01.388
This fucking kid.

47:01.390 --> 47:03.890
- Milo?
- What's up, bro?

47:03.892 --> 47:06.192
Looks like you got a shadow.

47:06.194 --> 47:07.229
Yeah.

47:12.868 --> 47:15.935
- You see Dostum's men ride up that mountain today?
- Yeah.

47:15.937 --> 47:19.506
Had his whole army ready
to travel in five minutes.

47:19.508 --> 47:21.441
My guess is the Taliban
ain't much different.

47:21.443 --> 47:22.776
It's not gonna be easy.

47:22.778 --> 47:24.912
Yeah,
these people are tough.

47:24.914 --> 47:26.354
How do you know
so much about horses?

47:27.848 --> 47:30.051
No, I grew up on a ranch.

47:31.053 --> 47:32.720
Father taught me.

47:32.722 --> 47:34.555
About the only thing
he was ever good

47:34.557 --> 47:36.122
and gentle with were horses.

47:36.124 --> 47:37.890
So the old man
ruled with an iron fist?

47:37.892 --> 47:39.493
And a leather belt.

47:39.495 --> 47:41.361
- Anything he could get his hands on.
- Oh, yeah?

47:41.363 --> 47:43.229
Must have been best friends
with my old man.

47:43.231 --> 47:44.997
Oh, yeah?

47:44.999 --> 47:48.134
I hope they let us see
this one through, you know?

47:48.136 --> 47:50.736
Afghanistan's been invaded
for the last 2,000 years

47:50.738 --> 47:52.540
repeatedly by everyone.

47:52.542 --> 47:54.307
Genghis Khan,
Alexander the Great...

47:54.309 --> 47:56.042
You've been reading up
on the place?

47:56.044 --> 47:59.011
I was a history teacher.

47:59.013 --> 48:00.546
- Get the fuck out!
- No! I swear to God!

48:00.548 --> 48:01.747
- You serious?
- Yeah.

48:01.749 --> 48:03.149
Shit, that's right.

48:03.151 --> 48:04.752
No, I remember
reading something about it.

48:04.754 --> 48:06.386
In your report.
It wasn't long though.

48:06.388 --> 48:08.622
What happened? I didn't...

48:08.624 --> 48:09.890
I got into a fight
with this guy

48:09.892 --> 48:11.089
who was harassing
my girlfriend, you know.

48:11.091 --> 48:12.991
And I kind of beat him up
pretty bad.

48:12.993 --> 48:14.894
And where I was headed,
I was headed to jail.

48:14.896 --> 48:17.667
So, I chose the military.

48:18.533 --> 48:19.999
Shit, man.

48:20.001 --> 48:22.569
And here you are years later
sitting in a cave.

48:22.571 --> 48:24.236
Yeah, I should have
chose jail.

48:26.008 --> 48:28.575
Why do your men stand guard?

48:28.577 --> 48:31.377
You're my guests,
I protect you.

48:31.379 --> 48:33.879
We're not just your guests,
General. We're your allies.

48:33.881 --> 48:35.615
My men aren't standing guard
against you.

48:35.617 --> 48:36.783
They're standing with you.

48:36.785 --> 48:38.451
This is my responsibility.

48:38.453 --> 48:42.055
This is how we're trained.
We have orders to follow.

48:42.057 --> 48:44.792
That's the difference
between you and me.

48:44.794 --> 48:47.426
You have many men over you.

48:47.428 --> 48:50.031
Over me, only God.

48:56.437 --> 49:00.073
God, that was, that was some
real bonding right there.

49:00.075 --> 49:01.309
Yeah.

49:05.479 --> 49:08.580
Sir, sitrep from Spencer.

49:08.582 --> 49:11.517
He's requesting a supply drop
for Dostum's men.

49:11.519 --> 49:14.321
Winter's coming, and they
need gear and provisions.

49:14.323 --> 49:16.154
Yeah, ship it out.
Where's Nelson?

49:16.156 --> 49:19.491
Not sure. Terrain's cutting
off radio reception.

49:19.493 --> 49:23.629
He thinks that Nelson's
en route to Dostum's HQ.

49:23.631 --> 49:26.533
Our best guess is here.
Cobaki.

49:26.535 --> 49:29.002
All right, hold on. Why aren't
Nelson and Spencer together?

49:29.004 --> 49:31.370
Nelson split the team.
He took six men

49:31.372 --> 49:34.374
and left Spencer and
the others at the recon point.

49:34.376 --> 49:35.908
Christ, why'd he do that?

49:35.910 --> 49:37.611
Dostum only gave him
six horses.

49:37.613 --> 49:39.444
Apparently, that's the only
way to cross the mountains.

49:39.446 --> 49:40.848
According to Spencer,

49:40.850 --> 49:43.082
the horses aren't
just transportation.

49:43.084 --> 49:46.285
Spencer says Dostum
relies on them for combat.

49:46.287 --> 49:47.654
Horses?

49:47.656 --> 49:49.091
Yes, sir.

49:56.664 --> 49:59.300
There. Mullah Razzan's men.

50:00.135 --> 50:01.336
Wait, where?

50:02.638 --> 50:05.538
You see
the pickup trucks?

50:05.540 --> 50:09.008
Those are the Taliban forces
outside of Bescham.

50:09.010 --> 50:11.144
Right. Okay, General,
let me explain how this works.

50:11.146 --> 50:13.879
I need to be close enough to give the
exact coordinates and elevation.

50:13.881 --> 50:15.214
It's too dangerous.

50:15.216 --> 50:16.616
General, we're too far away.

50:16.618 --> 50:18.017
I can't call in anything
from here.

50:18.019 --> 50:20.352
500 of my men can die

50:20.354 --> 50:23.790
before one American gets
a scratch. You know why?

50:23.792 --> 50:25.058
No, why, sir?

50:25.060 --> 50:26.959
Because if one American die,

50:26.961 --> 50:29.729
your government leaves,
and then we lose the war.

50:29.731 --> 50:33.200
Okay. I'm dropping these bombs
from 30,000 feet.

50:33.202 --> 50:35.468
The plane doesn't guide
the bombs, I do.

50:35.470 --> 50:37.437
If I can't get close enough, I
can't call in the exact location.

50:37.439 --> 50:38.705
Give me your little map.

50:38.707 --> 50:40.009
Give me your map.

50:43.178 --> 50:46.779
There. See?
Here. Taliban.

50:46.781 --> 50:48.281
Here. Taliban.

50:48.283 --> 50:51.884
- Okay.
- And here, Taliban.

50:51.886 --> 50:53.587
Now drop your bomb.

50:53.589 --> 50:55.488
- He's not getting it.
- And we're still too far away.

50:55.490 --> 50:57.924
- Drop bombs.
- How do I even know this is the Taliban?

50:57.926 --> 50:59.526
Who else would it be?

50:59.528 --> 51:01.194
There are a lot of armies
in these mountains, General,

51:01.196 --> 51:04.029
and the U.S. is only at war
with one of them.

51:04.031 --> 51:05.464
You call me a liar?

51:05.466 --> 51:07.167
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying

51:07.169 --> 51:08.801
that we're so far away
I can't even tell

51:08.803 --> 51:10.483
what we're shooting at,
what we're hittin'.

51:16.111 --> 51:18.013
Christ, he's calling
the fucking Taliban.

51:25.553 --> 51:27.956
<i>America, fuck you!</i>

51:29.992 --> 51:32.160
See? Drop bombs.

51:37.531 --> 51:40.801
<i>Badger 17, this is Alpha 595.</i>

51:40.803 --> 51:42.769
We need a drop
on enemy position.

51:42.771 --> 51:48.006
8-4-7-2, 6-5-4-3.
How copy? Over.

51:48.008 --> 51:49.843
<i>Alpha 595, I copy.</i>

51:49.845 --> 51:53.212
<i>8-4-7-2, 6-5-4-3, over.</i>

51:53.214 --> 51:54.982
Roger. Drop when ready.

51:54.984 --> 51:57.450
You hit the green on this one,
boss, you're a goddamn wizard.

51:57.452 --> 51:58.953
Yeah, no shit.

52:02.557 --> 52:03.559
Come on.

52:38.526 --> 52:40.192
Shit.

52:40.194 --> 52:42.231
All right, someone explain
to these guys we missed.

52:58.914 --> 53:02.314
Goddamn. Shit.

53:02.316 --> 53:04.850
That was ridiculous. I didn't
come here to play around.

53:04.852 --> 53:06.953
Check fire, we're way off.

53:06.955 --> 53:09.224
Stay here,
I'll call back coordinates.

53:10.725 --> 53:12.491
No, no, Nelson.

53:12.493 --> 53:14.761
- Where's Cap going?
- I don't know. Coffers.

53:14.763 --> 53:16.863
I'm getting closer.

53:52.367 --> 53:54.169
Wasn't gonna let you have
all the fun.

53:56.937 --> 53:58.772
You ready for new coordinates?

53:58.774 --> 54:02.042
Yeah, we got some
anxious people up here.

54:02.044 --> 54:05.111
8-3-9-6...

54:05.113 --> 54:06.645
Bad element maneuvered
in on 'em.

54:06.647 --> 54:09.082
Captain, there's an element
moving in on you.

54:18.260 --> 54:20.192
All right, stay here.
Let's go!

54:55.397 --> 54:59.034
I'll say again. 8-3-9...

54:59.667 --> 55:02.136
6-4-5-7.

55:05.039 --> 55:07.141
Clear and hot.

55:09.211 --> 55:11.446
Bombs inbound, boys.
Let's move!

55:14.448 --> 55:16.015
We're danger close, Cap!

55:16.017 --> 55:17.752
Move back! Move!

55:20.789 --> 55:22.057
Move! Move!

55:53.555 --> 55:54.654
General.

55:54.656 --> 55:56.555
Their forward position's
obliterated.

55:56.557 --> 55:58.457
Why aren't we moving
on the village?

55:58.459 --> 55:59.825
You will not
live long here

55:59.827 --> 56:01.461
if you ignore
what I'm telling you.

56:01.463 --> 56:02.995
You told me to bomb,
that's what I did.

56:02.997 --> 56:04.129
Why aren't we attacking?

56:04.131 --> 56:05.832
That wasn't the plan today.

56:05.834 --> 56:07.403
You mind telling me the plan?

56:09.104 --> 56:10.606
We attack tomorrow.

56:13.175 --> 56:15.341
Tomorrow. Great.
So that was, uh, what?

56:15.343 --> 56:16.808
Nice little dress rehearsal?

56:16.810 --> 56:19.580
A rehearsal, yeah. Great.

56:39.834 --> 56:41.901
I'm not gonna negotiate.

56:41.903 --> 56:43.336
These are my boots.

56:43.338 --> 56:45.805
You know, the ones you stole
from our drop?

56:47.508 --> 56:49.241
I don't know what that means.

56:49.243 --> 56:51.611
I bet you we haven't
even found half our shit.

56:51.613 --> 56:52.614
Yeah.

56:54.450 --> 56:56.570
Oh, yeah. That roof
looks familiar, doesn't it?

56:57.352 --> 56:59.788
Hey, how much, huh?

57:01.488 --> 57:04.022
What is that? $10? $9.50?

57:04.024 --> 57:06.125
Huh?

57:06.127 --> 57:09.529
They got 10% of our MREs,
a quarter of our blankets.

57:09.531 --> 57:11.333
We're missing a lot.

57:14.202 --> 57:15.503
What?

57:20.341 --> 57:22.140
Guess they like
our chem suits.

57:22.142 --> 57:23.578
<i>TrÃ¨s chic.</i>

57:52.506 --> 57:54.209
I'd like to tell you
it gets easier, but...

58:02.017 --> 58:04.750
You know, every now and then,

58:04.752 --> 58:07.522
you meet a guy
who doesn't feel anything.

58:08.722 --> 58:12.625
He goes out there,
he kills people.

58:12.627 --> 58:17.196
Falls asleep before his head
hits the pillow.

58:17.198 --> 58:21.435
You know, I used to think that
that'd be better, right?

58:22.569 --> 58:24.705
That maybe
I was just too weak.

58:26.774 --> 58:27.809
Then I realized...

58:28.542 --> 58:31.176
Nah.

58:31.178 --> 58:34.682
That's the thing that
reminds us that we're humans.

58:56.269 --> 58:58.071
Hey, here we go.

58:58.073 --> 58:59.538
How'd you make out?

58:59.540 --> 59:00.973
All kinds of goodies.

59:00.975 --> 59:02.674
Good. Get most of it back?

59:02.676 --> 59:04.276
It was like shopping
at Macy's.

59:04.278 --> 59:05.511
- Hey, yo, Spence, bro.
- Yeah.

59:05.513 --> 59:07.180
See that little kid
over there?

59:07.182 --> 59:08.281
Yeah.

59:08.283 --> 59:09.649
I can't even take a piss

59:09.651 --> 59:11.651
without the kid
up in my business.

59:11.653 --> 59:13.618
Well, it is
pretty fascinating.

59:13.620 --> 59:15.220
No, not really. It's not.

59:15.222 --> 59:17.890
No. He follows me around
like a little stray dog, bro.

59:17.892 --> 59:19.892
Why don't you stop
giving him treats?

59:19.894 --> 59:21.560
Bro, that's the thing. I don't
give him shit, all right?

59:21.562 --> 59:22.995
He just follows me
around smiling

59:22.997 --> 59:24.497
with his little 1910 gun, bro.

59:24.499 --> 59:25.801
You don't get it, do you?

59:26.434 --> 59:28.567
What, Spence?

59:28.569 --> 59:31.069
These guys guard us.

59:31.071 --> 59:32.805
Any one of us gets killed,

59:32.807 --> 59:35.241
Dostum might execute the man
he thinks is responsible

59:35.243 --> 59:37.642
and his whole family.

59:37.644 --> 59:40.715
And this poor boy got you.

59:43.084 --> 59:44.616
So be nice.

59:44.618 --> 59:45.787
Be nice.

59:50.459 --> 59:51.993
Hey, uh, Najeeb?

59:53.562 --> 59:56.462
Here, bro,
I got you a little...

59:56.464 --> 59:59.434
It's a little sucker.
Put it in your mouth.

01:00:04.738 --> 01:00:08.006
No, no!
You take the thing off it.

01:00:08.008 --> 01:00:11.011
And then you put it
in your mouth. Yeah.

01:00:11.013 --> 01:00:12.745
Put it in your mouth. Yeah.

01:00:12.747 --> 01:00:15.848
Don't even fucking go there,
bro. Don't go there, bro.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.415
- Give me my shoes.
- That's cute.

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:19.718
- Shut up.
- It's cute.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.854
This is their
next objective, Bescham.

01:00:21.856 --> 01:00:25.491
There's only one way in,
and the Taliban know it.

01:00:25.493 --> 01:00:27.560
They're dug in hard
just outside of town

01:00:27.562 --> 01:00:29.428
right here, heavily fortified.

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.962
The whole fucking thing's
a buzzsaw, sir.

01:00:30.964 --> 01:00:33.732
Yeah, then why the hell is
Nelson walking into it?

01:00:33.734 --> 01:00:34.836
Shit.

01:00:35.702 --> 01:00:37.337
Did I pick the wrong guy?

01:00:37.339 --> 01:00:40.939
Sir, this one's not on Nelson.
It's geography.

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.908
Bescham is the only way
to Mazari.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:46.645
Yeah, maybe so. But we can't
pin all our hopes on Nelson.

01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:48.647
Let's get a second team
in the works.

01:00:48.649 --> 01:00:50.350
If Dostum doesn't make it
to Bescham

01:00:50.352 --> 01:00:52.752
by the time
the weather sets in,

01:00:52.754 --> 01:00:55.254
it's gonna be a real shitshow.

01:01:00.794 --> 01:01:03.932
General,
B-52s are in position.

01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:08.968
You have any idea
what's going on?

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.837
Dostum need to find out if his
nephew still over there,

01:01:10.839 --> 01:01:12.638
fighting along with Taliban.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.205
Many switch sides.

01:01:14.207 --> 01:01:18.778
For necessity, loyalty change.
Some every other week.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.446
Why the hell
would they do that?

01:01:20.448 --> 01:01:22.413
A lot of these guys
are farmers.

01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:23.816
Taliban comes through,

01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:25.049
they torture, murder,
force them to fight.

01:01:25.051 --> 01:01:26.454
What choice do they have?

01:01:28.122 --> 01:01:30.254
Is it just me
or does it feel like

01:01:30.256 --> 01:01:33.761
these assholes are counting their
money every time they look at us?

01:01:38.966 --> 01:01:40.165
General.

01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:45.370
His nephew left this morning.
We can proceed.

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:48.874
Oh. Great.
War's back on, guys.

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:50.977
General, we're minutes
from range.

01:01:50.979 --> 01:01:52.812
Is there anything you can tell me
so I can better prepare my men

01:01:52.814 --> 01:01:54.214
- to assist you?
- Very good.

01:01:58.685 --> 01:02:00.620
I don't know if horses
were the best idea today.

01:02:00.622 --> 01:02:02.756
The bombs are gonna
scare them bad.

01:02:02.758 --> 01:02:05.524
The horses know
that these are American bombs.

01:02:05.526 --> 01:02:07.091
They won't be afraid.

01:02:07.093 --> 01:02:11.863
Oh, they know that
they're American bombs. Okay.

01:02:11.865 --> 01:02:13.765
Makes sense.

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:15.603
Wookie-99, new grid.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.173
8-3-4-2, break, 6-6-4-9.

01:02:40.794 --> 01:02:42.895
Eastern flank is clear,
General.

01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:46.432
You Americans,
stay here!

01:03:08.122 --> 01:03:10.555
They're surrendering. Razzan
is shooting his own men.

01:03:10.557 --> 01:03:11.992
Jesus Christ.

01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:27.238
Hey, where the hell
did those come from?

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.810
How did Dostum not know
about a supply line?

01:03:34.714 --> 01:03:36.716
Wookie-99,
we need a drop.

01:03:36.718 --> 01:03:38.216
<i>Negative. I'm bingo.</i>

01:03:38.218 --> 01:03:39.852
You're kidding me!
I'm staring at a company

01:03:39.854 --> 01:03:41.453
of tanks. We need a drop!

01:03:41.455 --> 01:03:43.224
<i>I'm sorry, I'm out
of fuel, sir. I'm out.</i>

01:04:17.457 --> 01:04:19.957
Hey, they're getting slaughtered.
We gotta cover their retreat.

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:22.563
Michaels, Coffers,
base element.

01:04:53.894 --> 01:04:54.896
Go!

01:05:11.678 --> 01:05:13.779
Dostum!

01:05:13.781 --> 01:05:16.117
We've lost air support!
Fall back!

01:05:22.222 --> 01:05:23.122
Fall back!

01:05:23.124 --> 01:05:25.193
Bennett! Bennett,
are you okay?

01:05:34.834 --> 01:05:36.937
Now you have killer eyes!

01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:41.810
Go!

01:05:43.943 --> 01:05:45.209
Fucking hold him
still, man.

01:05:45.211 --> 01:05:48.315
I'm fucking holding him.
Jesus Christ.

01:05:51.252 --> 01:05:52.450
All right.

01:06:00.028 --> 01:06:02.160
He's gone. He's gone.

01:06:02.162 --> 01:06:05.065
Let's move him up. Up there.

01:06:17.044 --> 01:06:21.046
General, you know
this area, right?

01:06:21.048 --> 01:06:22.749
Right? Which means you knew

01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:24.383
about the Taliban's
supply line,

01:06:24.385 --> 01:06:25.685
and you didn't tell me.

01:06:25.687 --> 01:06:27.486
If I had known,
if you had told me,

01:06:27.488 --> 01:06:29.848
I could have hit that column
before they ever made it to us.

01:06:31.658 --> 01:06:33.359
If you wanna kill
your own men, that's fine.

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:34.727
But I ain't letting you put
my men

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:36.229
in harm's way, you understand?

01:06:36.231 --> 01:06:37.930
Everywhere you go
is harm's way.

01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:40.399
No shit.

01:06:40.401 --> 01:06:44.303
We're fighting with horsemen
against tanks.

01:06:44.305 --> 01:06:46.404
You have an obligation to
tell me everything you know.

01:06:46.406 --> 01:06:48.540
You don't have a stomach
for everything I know.

01:06:48.542 --> 01:06:49.975
Ah, fuck.

01:06:49.977 --> 01:06:51.743
You will not win here

01:06:51.745 --> 01:06:53.448
because you are not honest
with yourself.

01:06:54.682 --> 01:06:57.582
You expect victory
without blood.

01:06:57.584 --> 01:07:00.819
I expect you to share
strategic information with us.

01:07:00.821 --> 01:07:02.654
Otherwise what the fuck
are we doing here?

01:07:02.656 --> 01:07:04.656
Your anger
comes from your fear

01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:06.191
because you live in a place

01:07:06.193 --> 01:07:08.694
where life looks better
than afterlife.

01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:10.462
That's not this place.

01:07:10.464 --> 01:07:13.301
Here, Taliban kills everything
you live for.

01:07:14.901 --> 01:07:18.005
Your mission will fail
because you fear death.

01:07:19.707 --> 01:07:22.808
Mullah Razzan's men,
the Taliban,

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.810
they welcome it.

01:07:24.812 --> 01:07:28.980
Because they believe there is
riches waiting for them in Heaven.

01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:31.383
Give me the goddamn
information I need,

01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:33.785
and I'll reward
every last one of them.

01:07:36.624 --> 01:07:38.256
General, I'm your link

01:07:38.258 --> 01:07:40.359
to the greatest weaponry in
the history of civilization.

01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:44.296
You gotta stop guarding me
and start trusting me.

01:07:44.298 --> 01:07:48.968
Greatest weapon
in history is this.

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.069
I don't have soldiers
in my army,

01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:53.240
not one. Only warriors.

01:07:54.675 --> 01:07:58.176
Stop being a soldier.

01:07:58.178 --> 01:08:03.251
Start using this,
and you can be a warrior, too.

01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:24.904
Come with me.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:46.528
Sit.

01:08:50.096 --> 01:08:53.301
They bring their weapons
through Tiangi Gap.

01:08:54.234 --> 01:08:56.301
Out here, there's nothing.

01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:59.871
No passage, no water.
No shade.

01:08:59.872 --> 01:09:02.573
So the only way
to Mazar-i-Sharif

01:09:02.575 --> 01:09:04.675
is through Tiangi Gap.

01:09:04.676 --> 01:09:06.178
That's a choke point.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.580
That's the only way.

01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:09.982
So, for us to take Mazar,

01:09:09.984 --> 01:09:11.550
- we'll have to beat him in this Gap.
- Yes.

01:09:11.551 --> 01:09:14.853
To get access to their
stronghold in Tiangi,

01:09:14.854 --> 01:09:17.191
we must first take Bescham.

01:09:19.158 --> 01:09:22.294
You know, you have the sky,

01:09:22.296 --> 01:09:25.265
but wars are won in the dirt.

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:29.068
I knew
about their supply line.

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:31.471
But I didn't expect
their weapons.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.577
Fakir was my godson.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:40.112
Every time you lose a man,

01:09:40.113 --> 01:09:42.250
it's like a stab
in your heart.

01:09:44.452 --> 01:09:48.286
And my heart is butchered,
my friend.

01:09:48.287 --> 01:09:51.425
Don't think I send my men
out there to die.

01:09:55.229 --> 01:09:57.899
I'm going to win you
this thing, I swear to God.

01:10:02.837 --> 01:10:05.170
I believe you.

01:10:05.172 --> 01:10:06.772
Now see,
the Taliban won't be

01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.139
defending
their western flank

01:10:08.141 --> 01:10:09.541
because they can't
imagine anything

01:10:09.543 --> 01:10:11.077
coming from this desert.

01:10:11.079 --> 01:10:12.911
Now, it's a crazy idea, but...

01:10:12.913 --> 01:10:14.145
But what?

01:10:14.147 --> 01:10:15.548
Well,
the Taliban reinforcements

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:18.015
come through here.
Through the Tiangi Gap.

01:10:18.017 --> 01:10:21.185
This is why Dostum's killing
himself trying to move forward.

01:10:21.187 --> 01:10:22.821
All the Taliban has to do

01:10:22.823 --> 01:10:25.890
is hold him off long enough
to bring in more artillery.

01:10:25.892 --> 01:10:29.327
There's nothing out there.
There's no water, no nothing.

01:10:29.329 --> 01:10:32.464
When you come in behind their
line, you cut that chain.

01:10:32.466 --> 01:10:34.733
Ammo dumps, convoys, anything
you can hit, you hit it.

01:10:34.735 --> 01:10:37.803
Can I walk it? I'm sick
of that fucking horse.

01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:40.038
Diller, it's
120 klicks or something.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.143
A drop would give up your position.
You gotta pack everything in.

01:10:44.145 --> 01:10:45.710
Can Dostum give us some mules?

01:10:45.712 --> 01:10:47.380
- Yeah, probably.
- Okay.

01:10:47.382 --> 01:10:49.113
But listen, whoever does this
thing has got to understand,

01:10:49.115 --> 01:10:51.149
this is different than what
we've been doing, all right?

01:10:51.151 --> 01:10:52.917
You're on your own.
No reinforcements,

01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:54.489
no extraction, nothing.

01:10:56.524 --> 01:10:59.390
Shit, I can't order
anyone to do this.

01:10:59.392 --> 01:11:01.229
Someone's got to volunteer.

01:11:01.829 --> 01:11:03.228
Yes, you can.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:05.165
Just give us the order.

01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:10.501
That's an order.

01:11:10.503 --> 01:11:12.603
Nothin' I'd rather do.

01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:15.506
- Now pick two guys.
- Bennett.

01:11:15.508 --> 01:11:17.576
- I'm in.
- Coffers?

01:11:17.578 --> 01:11:20.813
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
Thank you, sir.

01:11:20.815 --> 01:11:22.183
No, thank you.

01:11:23.316 --> 01:11:24.517
Good luck, Bennett.

01:11:24.519 --> 01:11:26.151
Give 'em hell, buddy.

01:11:26.153 --> 01:11:28.556
I guess the best-looking
fellas get the choice...

01:11:37.664 --> 01:11:40.133
<i>595 Bravo, come in.</i>

01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:42.968
Go for Bravo.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.169
Hey, did you guys get horses?

01:11:44.171 --> 01:11:45.304
<i>Yes.</i>

01:11:45.306 --> 01:11:47.205
All right, good.
Ride up to us.

01:11:47.207 --> 01:11:49.907
I split the team again,
sent Diller downrange.

01:11:49.909 --> 01:11:52.245
Roger that. On our way.

01:12:06.593 --> 01:12:09.560
Welcome
to the Ritz, boys.

01:12:09.562 --> 01:12:12.363
Valet will take your horses
in the back.

01:12:12.365 --> 01:12:14.331
Came all the way
up here for this?

01:12:14.333 --> 01:12:15.666
Where's the pool?

01:12:15.668 --> 01:12:17.135
Trying to work
on my suntan, bro.

01:12:17.137 --> 01:12:18.740
I think my massage
is at 4:00.

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.340
Whoa, whoa.

01:12:21.342 --> 01:12:22.573
What the hell happened
to Spencer?

01:12:22.575 --> 01:12:24.844
Well, he was right
behind us, Cap.

01:12:24.846 --> 01:12:26.143
Oh.

01:12:26.145 --> 01:12:28.013
Shit.

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:29.648
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:33.285
Yeah, I'm fine. I gotta get
off this goddamn horse.

01:12:33.287 --> 01:12:35.719
It's his back.
He slipped a disc, I think.

01:12:35.721 --> 01:12:37.024
All right.

01:12:37.824 --> 01:12:39.925
Give me your...

01:12:39.927 --> 01:12:41.760
I got you. Okay.

01:12:41.762 --> 01:12:43.527
- Oh. Oh!
- Easy.

01:12:43.529 --> 01:12:45.096
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck!

01:12:45.098 --> 01:12:47.068
Fucking heavy.

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:48.532
Sorry.

01:12:48.534 --> 01:12:50.868
You're all right. You're good.

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.371
Now, listen. Diller,
he missed his first check-in.

01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:55.808
Well, it's the mountains.
No reception, right?

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.008
Yeah, maybe.

01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:58.343
Where'd you send him?

01:12:58.345 --> 01:12:59.879
He's flanking
their supply route.

01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:00.979
Risky.

01:13:00.981 --> 01:13:02.447
Little bit.

01:13:02.449 --> 01:13:04.683
Well, the band's
back together.

01:13:04.685 --> 01:13:08.286
Jesus, chief,
you look like my grandpa.

01:13:08.288 --> 01:13:10.854
20 bucks if you can
stand up straight.

01:13:10.856 --> 01:13:13.259
You can keep that $20.

01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:16.027
Well, the best thing about
calling in airstrikes,

01:13:16.029 --> 01:13:17.895
you can do it
laying down, right?

01:13:17.897 --> 01:13:19.130
That's right.

01:13:19.132 --> 01:13:21.335
Let's get this war started!

01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:50.798
So far all clear, Cap.

01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:30.837
Hmm.

01:14:32.105 --> 01:14:33.840
What do you think?

01:15:25.659 --> 01:15:27.361
Jesus, we didn't get
all of them.

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:06.430
Captain! What's the order?

01:16:06.432 --> 01:16:08.970
Cover Dostum!
Follow him! Move!

01:16:11.338 --> 01:16:12.806
Move!

01:16:22.482 --> 01:16:24.718
Milo! Ready?

01:16:29.722 --> 01:16:30.757
Go!

01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:36.963
Milo!

01:16:39.065 --> 01:16:40.300
Get the fuck over here!

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:50.477
Shit.

01:17:23.944 --> 01:17:25.242
Jones!

01:17:25.244 --> 01:17:26.344
Huh?

01:17:26.346 --> 01:17:27.815
Moving!

01:17:55.109 --> 01:17:56.544
Rocket!

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.730
<i>595, we're all clear.</i>

01:18:36.615 --> 01:18:38.215
Try it again, bro.

01:18:38.217 --> 01:18:39.384
"Motherfucker."

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:42.587
Mudda fuggah.

01:18:42.589 --> 01:18:44.458
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:52.764
You know,
I was thinking, uh,

01:18:52.766 --> 01:18:57.835
if I continue to follow you, I'm
probably not gonna live very long.

01:18:57.837 --> 01:19:01.105
That's some ballsy shit
you did back there.

01:19:01.107 --> 01:19:03.508
Sometimes you have
to lead your men

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:05.945
back into the right direction.

01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:12.149
What's the game
they're playing?

01:19:12.151 --> 01:19:14.685
<i>Besh Tosh.</i> Uzbek game.

01:19:14.687 --> 01:19:16.054
<i>Besh Tosh?</i>

01:19:16.056 --> 01:19:19.126
<i>Besh,</i> five.
<i>Tosh,</i> rocks.

01:19:21.162 --> 01:19:25.630
You know,
when I ruled over Bescham,

01:19:25.632 --> 01:19:30.669
women wore no veils.
Girls went to school.

01:19:30.671 --> 01:19:33.740
We had movies at the theater.

01:19:38.378 --> 01:19:41.015
But here,
Razzan killed my family.

01:19:43.315 --> 01:19:47.020
I dreamed about taking it
back, but now that I'm here,

01:19:47.921 --> 01:19:49.990
I don't wanna walk in.

01:19:52.693 --> 01:19:54.727
Too much pain.

01:19:58.765 --> 01:20:01.101
I hope you never know it.

01:20:03.003 --> 01:20:04.202
Uh, Cap?

01:20:04.204 --> 01:20:05.870
Yeah?

01:20:05.872 --> 01:20:08.540
You got a message through
secure interface with Bowers.

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:09.707
It's from SecDef.

01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:11.341
Yeah, I'll read it later, man.

01:20:11.343 --> 01:20:13.176
Sorry, Cap.

01:20:13.178 --> 01:20:16.249
The Donald Rumsfeld just sent you
an email and it ain't a good one.

01:20:23.757 --> 01:20:25.590
What's it say?

01:20:25.592 --> 01:20:28.629
"When are you gonna get off
your ass and get to Mazar?"

01:20:32.466 --> 01:20:34.068
Jesus Christ.

01:20:43.243 --> 01:20:46.377
You know what?
Write this back to him.

01:20:46.379 --> 01:20:49.550
"Sir, let me explain
the reality on the ground."

01:20:51.284 --> 01:20:52.752
Write it.

01:20:53.419 --> 01:20:55.286
Okay.

01:20:55.288 --> 01:20:56.920
"I'm advising a man

01:20:56.922 --> 01:21:01.526

cavalry against T-72 tanks,

01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:04.161
"mortars, machine guns."

<i>"A tactic I think

01:21:06.432 --> 01:21:08.800

<i>"of AK-47 ammunition per man."</i>

01:21:13.239 --> 01:21:14.473
Lisa, get in here.

01:21:14.475 --> 01:21:16.875
<i>"With snipers having less than
100 rounds</i>

01:21:16.877 --> 01:21:20.211
<i>"with little water
and less food."</i>

01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:22.947
The letter's too well written.
I know it can't be Hal.

01:21:22.949 --> 01:21:25.149
<i>"We witnessed the horse
cavalry bounding</i>

01:21:25.151 --> 01:21:27.919

<i>"artillery and sniper fire."</i>

01:21:31.357 --> 01:21:33.224
That's Mitch.

01:21:33.226 --> 01:21:34.892
<i>"Everywhere I go to,

01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:36.594

<i>"once the Taliban are gone."</i>

01:22:03.455 --> 01:22:07.925
Raven, this is Charlie 595.
Good drop. Good drop.

01:22:07.927 --> 01:22:09.359
We hit one of their outposts.

01:22:09.361 --> 01:22:10.795
Weapons cache destroyed.

01:22:10.797 --> 01:22:13.200
Stand by for detailed sitrep
to follow.

01:22:26.945 --> 01:22:30.214
So you take your grenade
and throw it?

01:22:30.216 --> 01:22:32.783
This should hold you
for a while.

01:22:32.785 --> 01:22:35.586
Yeah.
Hey, get Mitch over here.

01:22:35.588 --> 01:22:36.787
Hey, Captain!

01:22:36.789 --> 01:22:39.193
- Yeah.
- Come over here, please!

01:22:40.193 --> 01:22:42.396
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:47.098
It's like a javelin.

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.803
- You all right, Hal?
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:54.840
So you think you're making
any progress with Dostum?

01:22:54.842 --> 01:22:56.907
Yeah. Yeah, we're doing good.

01:22:56.909 --> 01:22:59.411
We're thinking of getting an apartment
together when this is all over.

01:22:59.413 --> 01:23:04.215
Oh, shit.
No, don't make me laugh.

01:23:04.217 --> 01:23:07.452
Glad you got a sense of humor.
I got some bad news.

01:23:07.454 --> 01:23:09.054
What?

01:23:09.056 --> 01:23:13.256
Headquarters inserted ODA 555
with Atta's militia.

01:23:13.258 --> 01:23:15.859
Wait, General Atta,
Dostum's rival?

01:23:15.861 --> 01:23:20.130
They think they have a better
shot of reaching Mazar-i-Sharif.

01:23:20.132 --> 01:23:22.567
They don't trust us
to get through the gauntlet.

01:23:22.569 --> 01:23:23.934
This kills us, Hal.

01:23:23.936 --> 01:23:25.937
The minute Dostum hears
about Atta,

01:23:25.939 --> 01:23:27.908
he's gonna forget
all about the Taliban.

01:23:28.374 --> 01:23:30.174
Could be.

01:23:30.176 --> 01:23:32.109
You might wanna
break up camp now,

01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:34.112
in case you gotta
get out of here quick.

01:23:34.114 --> 01:23:35.380
Yeah.

01:23:35.382 --> 01:23:37.415
Hey, think of it this way.

01:23:37.417 --> 01:23:40.085
You've just been handed
the most important

01:23:40.087 --> 01:23:42.756
diplomatic job
in the free world.

01:23:44.324 --> 01:23:46.827
Keeping the Northern Alliance
together.

01:24:12.284 --> 01:24:15.219
Oh, finally.
I'm starving to death.

01:24:19.359 --> 01:24:20.894
Habib.

01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:24.094
Tell him that I wanna buy
one of his sheep.

01:24:29.468 --> 01:24:31.202
He says
they're not for sale.

01:24:31.204 --> 01:24:32.903
Everything's for sale.

01:24:32.905 --> 01:24:35.305
Okay, tell him that we'll give
him 50 American dollars.

01:24:43.115 --> 01:24:44.916
He says he will take $500.

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:47.352
For that?

01:24:47.354 --> 01:24:48.486
How much are they worth?

01:24:48.488 --> 01:24:49.653
$100.

01:24:49.655 --> 01:24:51.158
Okay.

01:24:55.128 --> 01:24:56.426
Huh?

01:24:56.428 --> 01:24:58.795
300 American dollars.

01:24:58.797 --> 01:25:00.233
Yes?

01:25:00.734 --> 01:25:02.233
Good?

01:25:02.235 --> 01:25:04.301
This guy should be
a fucking military contractor.

01:25:04.303 --> 01:25:05.737
All right.

01:25:05.739 --> 01:25:07.406
Great. Lamb chops.

01:25:18.985 --> 01:25:20.550
It's a great day,
my friend.

01:25:20.552 --> 01:25:24.121
The Taliban pulled back
to protect the Gap.

01:25:24.123 --> 01:25:27.158
We can move forward to here
in the morning.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:30.362
If we do tomorrow right, we can
run them all the way to Mazar.

01:25:30.364 --> 01:25:32.800
This war is won
or lost tomorrow.

01:25:35.202 --> 01:25:37.801
General, I wanna explain
one of the other missions

01:25:37.803 --> 01:25:39.303
that are taking place
tomorrow.

01:25:39.305 --> 01:25:41.304
There's another team
like mine,

01:25:41.306 --> 01:25:43.742
and they've been placed
with General Atta Mohammed.

01:25:43.744 --> 01:25:45.910
They're moving on Mazar
from the southeast.

01:25:45.912 --> 01:25:47.844
They gave north to Atta.

01:25:47.846 --> 01:25:49.846
From the U.S. point of view,
you're all the Northern Alliance.

01:25:49.848 --> 01:25:52.483
Who is the U.S. to tell me
what Northern Alliance is?

01:25:52.485 --> 01:25:54.785
If Atta moves
to Mazar-i-Sharif first...

01:25:54.787 --> 01:25:56.653
We're not dropping bombs so you can
go to war with Atta over the north.

01:25:56.655 --> 01:25:58.456
The mission hasn't changed,
General.

01:25:58.458 --> 01:26:00.291
We're gonna punch through
this Gap into the city.

01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:02.393
Tiangi Gap is over
two kilometers long.

01:26:02.395 --> 01:26:04.429
Razzan's best weapons
are right here.

01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:07.499
Machine guns, mortars,
heavy armors.

01:26:07.501 --> 01:26:12.036
And right here is 055 Brigade.
Foreign fighters. Al-Qaeda.

01:26:12.038 --> 01:26:14.538
They won't give an inch.
They prefer death.

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:17.140
I won't let my men die
so Atta can go to Mazar first.

01:26:17.142 --> 01:26:19.777
This isn't just your war,
General.

01:26:19.779 --> 01:26:22.413
There are thousands of people
dead in your country and mine.

01:26:22.415 --> 01:26:25.081
Now let me show you
how this is possible.

01:26:25.083 --> 01:26:28.152
All right? We've already
lured them into this Gap.

01:26:28.154 --> 01:26:29.953
I'm gonna put a man
on each flank,

01:26:29.955 --> 01:26:32.357
and we're gonna overwhelm
this canyon with air support.

01:26:32.359 --> 01:26:34.225
I've already sent
Diller downrange.

01:26:34.227 --> 01:26:37.062
He's gonna cut off any
resupply and hit any retreat.

01:26:37.064 --> 01:26:39.096
Then, you and I are gonna
charge through this Gap

01:26:39.098 --> 01:26:41.601
and hit that main body
with a full frontal assault.

01:26:43.035 --> 01:26:45.905
But Atta cannot
get to Mazar first.

01:26:47.774 --> 01:26:50.241
I'm taking my men through there,
General, with or without you.

01:26:50.243 --> 01:26:53.077
Without me and my men,
you are just an army of 12.

01:26:53.079 --> 01:26:55.246
You all will die.
Good luck.

01:26:55.248 --> 01:26:57.885
God damn it!
You're unbelievable.

01:26:59.217 --> 01:27:02.585
You showed me the town
where your family died.

01:27:02.587 --> 01:27:04.288
Told me every hell Razzan

01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:06.424
and his army unleashed
on this place.

01:27:06.426 --> 01:27:09.727
And now all you care about
is some turf war?

01:27:09.729 --> 01:27:13.197
You lectured me
about the heart of a warrior.

01:27:13.199 --> 01:27:16.168
You're no warrior.
You're just another warlord.

01:27:16.968 --> 01:27:18.670
Yeah, go ahead.

01:27:18.672 --> 01:27:21.141
It ain't us that's quitting,
General, it's you.

01:27:34.654 --> 01:27:37.188
That's not a happy face.

01:27:37.190 --> 01:27:40.160
I don't think
Dostum's on board.

01:27:41.394 --> 01:27:43.760
What do you mean not on board?

01:27:43.762 --> 01:27:46.663
He says he's not gonna fight a battle that
opens a way for his rival to take the city.

01:27:46.665 --> 01:27:48.265
That's not
very big-picture of him.

01:27:48.267 --> 01:27:50.867
He's fighting more than
one war here.

01:27:50.869 --> 01:27:53.470
Look, I don't like it, but these
are the cards we've been dealt.

01:27:53.472 --> 01:27:55.673
Yeah, well, Captain,
you gotta talk to him.

01:27:55.675 --> 01:27:57.840
I did. He's gone.

01:27:57.842 --> 01:28:00.978
He's taken most of his men, most
of the militia, and they left.

01:28:03.516 --> 01:28:06.317
Listen, I ain't gonna lie
to you guys.

01:28:06.319 --> 01:28:09.690
The chances are we are not
gonna make it out of this one.

01:28:12.792 --> 01:28:15.559
Goddamn, we're this close.

01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:19.363
We're so close to wiping
Al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan.

01:28:19.365 --> 01:28:22.700
We'll never get
another chance like this.

01:28:22.702 --> 01:28:25.069
But if we quit now,

01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:27.036
then what happened back home

01:28:27.038 --> 01:28:30.142
is gonna happen
again and again.

01:28:32.278 --> 01:28:34.481
Each of you gotta
make this decision,

01:28:35.146 --> 01:28:37.216
but I'm in.

01:28:38.685 --> 01:28:40.885
We're ready for anything.

01:28:40.887 --> 01:28:42.489
With or without him.

01:28:43.655 --> 01:28:45.755
Fuck him.

01:28:45.757 --> 01:28:48.026
I mean,
we're already here, right?

01:28:48.028 --> 01:28:50.827
All right.
We go in the morning.

01:28:50.829 --> 01:28:52.929
You take what's left
of the guards with you.

01:28:52.931 --> 01:28:54.631
And get some rest tonight.

01:28:54.633 --> 01:28:59.970
<i>Tomorrow's gonna decide it
one way or another.</i>

01:28:59.972 --> 01:29:04.310
<i>Spencer, Black. You call in
airstrikes from the eastern flank.</i>

01:29:06.678 --> 01:29:08.746
<i>Milo, Jackson and
Essex have been pushed out</i>

01:29:08.748 --> 01:29:12.282
against the enemy's
western flank right here.

01:29:12.284 --> 01:29:13.684
<i>Diller, Coffers and Bennett</i>

01:29:13.686 --> 01:29:15.385
<i>will cover the enemy's
northern flank</i>

01:29:15.387 --> 01:29:18.755
in an attempt to block
reinforcements from Mazar.

01:29:18.757 --> 01:29:20.858
<i>Falls and Michaels,
cover Jones and me</i>

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.096
<i>from the sniper position
on the southern flank.</i>

01:29:26.266 --> 01:29:29.302
Here we go
down the rabbit hole.

01:29:34.473 --> 01:29:36.173
- All right, Vern.
- Yeah.

01:29:36.175 --> 01:29:38.076
Who wins in a fight?

01:29:38.078 --> 01:29:40.611
Queen Elizabeth
or Margaret Thatcher?

01:29:40.613 --> 01:29:42.746
Jesus, Falls. Where do you
come up with this shit?

01:29:42.748 --> 01:29:45.217
From the depths
of my brilliant mind.

01:29:48.087 --> 01:29:49.588
Seeing that, boss?

01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:56.026
Falls, a scout just
picked us up.

01:29:56.028 --> 01:29:57.260
My two o'clock. Over.

01:29:57.262 --> 01:29:58.631
Target.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.235
Got him.

01:30:03.168 --> 01:30:04.738
650 yards.

01:30:05.704 --> 01:30:08.140
Hold to left.

01:30:13.111 --> 01:30:14.346
Good hit.

01:30:28.828 --> 01:30:30.363
Coffers,
get that radio up.

01:30:31.163 --> 01:30:32.662
I need 10 minutes.

01:30:32.664 --> 01:30:33.732
You got five.

01:30:34.934 --> 01:30:37.337
Like I said, five minutes.

01:30:54.753 --> 01:30:56.589
No Dostum, huh?

01:31:00.458 --> 01:31:04.295
K2 base,
this is 595 Delta. Over.

01:31:04.297 --> 01:31:06.865
Request medevac on standby.
Over.

01:31:06.867 --> 01:31:08.267
Roger.

01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:11.068
Shit.

01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:12.303
How we looking, J?

01:31:12.305 --> 01:31:15.171
Eh. We're in the right spot.

01:31:15.173 --> 01:31:18.876
Fuck, there's gotta be
at least 15,000 down there.

01:31:18.878 --> 01:31:20.911
<i>Spencer, this is Alpha.
We're in position.</i>

01:31:20.913 --> 01:31:22.379
<i>Start lasing targets
of opportunity.</i>

01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:24.415
Biggest guns first. Over.

01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:26.283
I am your biggest gun, Cap.

01:31:26.285 --> 01:31:28.620
Diller, welcome back, man.
How was your trip?

01:31:28.622 --> 01:31:30.388
<i>Oh, I'm doing great.</i>

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:32.857
<i>I'm looking at timeshares
over here for the summer.</i>

01:31:32.859 --> 01:31:34.992
All right.
Let's do this, boys.

01:31:34.994 --> 01:31:36.260
<i>Heads down, stay safe.</i>

01:31:36.262 --> 01:31:37.664
All right, good to go.

01:31:39.132 --> 01:31:40.500
All right, good.

01:31:42.735 --> 01:31:44.434
- Hey, yo, J?
- Yeah.

01:31:44.436 --> 01:31:47.440
055 brigade. Al-Qaeda.

01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.742
Gotta lead them
a bit more, bro.

01:31:50.744 --> 01:31:52.510
All right. Gotcha.

01:31:52.512 --> 01:31:56.147
Viper 47,
this is Bravo 595.

01:31:56.149 --> 01:32:01.655
Laser target designator 38.65.

01:32:03.088 --> 01:32:05.591
Target, tanks in the open.

01:32:39.357 --> 01:32:41.158
Nice shot, chief.

01:32:43.296 --> 01:32:45.830
How's that taste, huh?

01:32:45.832 --> 01:32:48.032
Okay, Bravo, good drop.
Shift your targets

01:32:48.034 --> 01:32:50.267
500 meters south. Over.

01:32:50.269 --> 01:32:52.603
Viper 47, new target.

01:32:52.605 --> 01:32:56.009
Multiple troops in the open.
Drop 500 meters east of...

01:32:57.110 --> 01:33:00.277
Chief? Chief, chief, chief.

01:33:00.279 --> 01:33:01.981
How'd they find us?

01:33:03.147 --> 01:33:04.881
They surrendering?

01:33:09.855 --> 01:33:12.622
Chief,
are they surrendering?

01:33:12.624 --> 01:33:15.859
Maybe.
Might be a trick.

01:33:15.861 --> 01:33:18.461
Keep your finger
on the trigger, okay?

01:33:19.832 --> 01:33:21.465
What do you wanna do
with them?

01:33:25.637 --> 01:33:28.438
Alpha 595, this is Bravo 595.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:31.008
We got a situation here.

01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:34.612
Multiple enemy combatants attempting
to surrender at our position.

01:33:37.516 --> 01:33:39.049
<i>Roger, Bravo.</i>

01:33:39.051 --> 01:33:41.421
Give me a sitrep
when they're contained. Over.

01:33:48.293 --> 01:33:52.598
Flash 21, this is 595 Charlie.
Request immediate...

01:34:05.610 --> 01:34:07.913
We gotta get
that goddamn antenna!

01:34:08.714 --> 01:34:09.882
Cover me!

01:34:29.435 --> 01:34:30.803
Oh, shit!

01:34:32.337 --> 01:34:34.737
They got a BM-21 and they're
going into the Gap!

01:34:38.977 --> 01:34:40.913
Do you want to surrender?

01:34:42.147 --> 01:34:44.447
Do you understand?

01:34:44.449 --> 01:34:48.318
No, no. Just stay there.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.022
Stay there, okay?

01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:54.090
If you wish to surrender,
you stay right there.

01:34:54.092 --> 01:34:57.027
Stop. All right.

01:35:06.271 --> 01:35:09.542
All right. We gotta
search each one of these guys.

01:35:10.209 --> 01:35:12.443
One by one.

01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:13.944
You hear me?

01:35:13.946 --> 01:35:15.411
Okay. Yeah.

01:35:15.413 --> 01:35:16.513
Stay sharp.

01:36:00.025 --> 01:36:04.027
Hal? Hal? Shit.

01:36:04.029 --> 01:36:06.899
Oh, shit! Hal? Hal?

01:36:08.199 --> 01:36:10.233
Hal? Oh, God.

01:36:10.235 --> 01:36:12.504
Hal, come on, buddy. Hal. Hal!

01:36:15.175 --> 01:36:16.476
Shit.

01:36:18.142 --> 01:36:21.278
No, no, no. Hal.
Hal, come on, buddy. Come on.

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.714
No, no, no.

01:36:24.949 --> 01:36:27.153
Hal! Come on! Oh, shit!

01:36:28.654 --> 01:36:31.255
Hey, buddy. Come on.

01:36:31.257 --> 01:36:34.861
Any station, Bravo is down!
Bravo is down!

01:36:36.028 --> 01:36:36.993
How bad?

01:36:36.995 --> 01:36:39.565
Bad! I need immediate medevac!

01:36:40.266 --> 01:36:42.068
I'm on it, sir.

01:36:52.477 --> 01:36:54.180
Here, fix this!

01:37:02.587 --> 01:37:04.755
Sir, better late
than never, huh?

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.778
Let's go! Let's go!

01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:31.314
- How about now?
- Yeah, yeah. Good, good.

01:37:31.316 --> 01:37:33.818
Alpha, this is Charlie.
Do you read me?

01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.518
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.520
<i>There's a BM-21 in the Gap,
loaded with rockets.</i>

01:37:37.522 --> 01:37:38.790
Oh, shit.

01:37:58.577 --> 01:38:00.547
What the fuck is that?

01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:38.416
Black,
give me Spencer's status.

01:38:38.418 --> 01:38:41.218
It's a sucking chest wound.
He's on a real clock here.

01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:45.688
All right, ready? Three,
two, one. Up. Let's go. Easy.

01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:47.457
Hey. Movement.

01:38:47.459 --> 01:38:49.026
Let's roll, boys. Let's roll.

01:38:49.028 --> 01:38:50.548
Get down. Get down.
Get down. Get down.

01:39:17.922 --> 01:39:20.225
Essex,
can you target the BM-21?

01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:24.196
Negative.

01:39:26.297 --> 01:39:27.529
Pulling back?

01:39:27.531 --> 01:39:28.834
Back to the horses. Move!

01:39:32.037 --> 01:39:33.071
Go!

01:39:42.413 --> 01:39:44.482
Taliban's gonna
swamp your position

01:39:44.484 --> 01:39:46.116
before a medevac can get in.

01:39:46.118 --> 01:39:47.986
Put the radio
to Spencer's ear.

01:39:53.258 --> 01:39:54.925
<i>All right, this is
double or nothing, Hal.</i>

01:39:54.927 --> 01:39:56.826
<i>We're gonna evac you.</i>

01:39:56.828 --> 01:39:58.895
Don't stop.

01:39:58.897 --> 01:40:01.064
We're not. We're gonna airlift you
from the other side of the Gap

01:40:01.066 --> 01:40:04.335
on the road to Mazar-i-Sharif.
It's the only way, Hal.

01:40:04.337 --> 01:40:07.203
<i>Remember,
the only way home is winning.</i>

01:40:07.205 --> 01:40:09.839
<i>You hang in there, my friend.</i>

01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:34.264
Call the drop now!

01:40:34.266 --> 01:40:37.666
464, adjust your target
20 meters west.

01:40:37.668 --> 01:40:38.768
How copy? Over.

01:40:38.770 --> 01:40:40.304
<i>Good copy, 595.</i>

01:40:40.306 --> 01:40:42.842
<i>But we are not authorized
so close to you.</i>

01:40:43.708 --> 01:40:46.009
Danger close, bro!

01:40:46.011 --> 01:40:49.013
464, requesting
danger close ordnance!

01:40:49.015 --> 01:40:51.249
<i>Copy that.
Danger close. Twenty seconds.</i>

01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:01.258
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Let's go! Let's go! Run!

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:02.729
Run!

01:41:36.361 --> 01:41:37.363
Essex?

01:41:39.931 --> 01:41:41.598
- Jackson?
- Yeah.

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.901
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.142
Najeeb?

01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.347
Najeeb.

01:41:59.217 --> 01:42:00.252
Najeeb.

01:42:04.922 --> 01:42:06.823
Come on, Najeeb. Come on.

01:42:06.825 --> 01:42:08.194
Milo?

01:42:09.294 --> 01:42:10.296
E!

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:18.870
Come on, Najeeb. Come on, bro.
Come on. Come on.

01:42:23.842 --> 01:42:25.175
- Are you okay?
- Go help Jackson.

01:42:25.177 --> 01:42:26.309
- Okay?
- Go help Jackson!

01:42:26.311 --> 01:42:28.113
- Look at me!
- Help Jackson!

01:42:29.647 --> 01:42:30.882
Jackson?

01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:33.751
Get up!

01:42:33.753 --> 01:42:36.319
- Get up!
- Come on.

01:42:36.321 --> 01:42:38.822
We gotta go.
We gotta fucking go.

01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.061
E!

01:42:43.895 --> 01:42:46.164
All right. All right?

01:42:48.199 --> 01:42:49.568
Najeeb?

01:42:50.703 --> 01:42:53.569
Come on. Let it out, man.
Come on.

01:42:53.571 --> 01:42:55.537
Let it out.

01:42:55.539 --> 01:42:57.640
We gotta go. We gotta go.

01:43:11.156 --> 01:43:12.322
<i>Cap, we lost</i>

01:43:12.324 --> 01:43:14.523
<i>communication with Essex.</i>

01:43:14.525 --> 01:43:17.227
<i>Keep trying them. Listen,
if we don't take out that BM-21,</i>

01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:18.562
<i>this whole thing is over.</i>

01:43:18.564 --> 01:43:20.831
It fires 40 rockets
in salvos. Got it?

01:43:20.833 --> 01:43:23.867
Forty, and then two minutes
to reload. Say it back to me.

01:43:23.869 --> 01:43:26.202
Two minutes.

01:43:26.204 --> 01:43:28.104
That's how long we're gonna have to storm
their positions, but we gotta get closer.

01:43:28.106 --> 01:43:31.006
<i>And hold there
until they stop to reload.</i>

01:43:31.008 --> 01:43:32.975
<i>K2 base,
this is Alpha.</i>

01:43:32.977 --> 01:43:35.879
Lead elements
crossing phase line red.

01:43:35.881 --> 01:43:37.415
Anticipate high casualties.

01:46:18.543 --> 01:46:20.210
38, 39.

01:46:20.212 --> 01:46:22.580
They're gonna have to
reload soon. We'll have two...

01:47:10.628 --> 01:47:11.663
Oh, shit!

01:47:32.751 --> 01:47:35.320
- Captain!
- Now's our window. Let's go!

01:48:16.328 --> 01:48:17.696
Contact front!

01:50:39.637 --> 01:50:41.270
Where's Diller?

01:50:41.272 --> 01:50:43.240
<i>Moving to our position.</i>

01:50:43.242 --> 01:50:45.311
<i>Bird incoming in two minutes.</i>

01:50:46.544 --> 01:50:50.515
Copy. Rendezvous at evac sight
and pop smoke.

01:51:44.436 --> 01:51:47.536
Get the horses out of here!
There's a chopper coming.

01:51:47.538 --> 01:51:48.772
How's he doing?

01:51:48.774 --> 01:51:50.740
Cap, I need that medevac
here right now!

01:51:50.742 --> 01:51:52.375
All right, it's coming.
It's coming.

01:51:52.377 --> 01:51:54.611
Chopper's inbound!
Jones, get that smoke out!

01:51:54.613 --> 01:51:56.411
All right, here they come,
buddy. Here they come.

01:51:56.413 --> 01:51:58.180
You hang in there, buddy.

01:51:58.182 --> 01:51:59.749
Did we get them?

01:51:59.751 --> 01:52:02.051
Yeah, man. We got them.
We got them good.

01:52:04.155 --> 01:52:07.493
Hey. Hey, you hang in there.
Don't you quit on us.

01:52:33.118 --> 01:52:35.521
Let's cover him up!
Cover up!

01:52:55.373 --> 01:52:56.738
Okay, ready?

01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:00.111
Three, two, one! Up!

01:53:24.668 --> 01:53:26.368
Has anyone seen Dostum?

01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:28.371
<i>Eye in the sky says
full retreat over here.</i>

01:53:28.373 --> 01:53:29.872
The whole Gap is clear.

01:53:29.874 --> 01:53:31.506
They're bugging out
all the way from Mazar.

01:53:31.508 --> 01:53:34.844
Does air visual
have eyes on Atta's militia?

01:53:34.846 --> 01:53:36.746
Yeah, they're approaching
from the east.

01:53:36.748 --> 01:53:38.615
Dostum's going for Atta.

01:53:38.617 --> 01:53:39.916
This whole thing falls apart

01:53:39.918 --> 01:53:41.952
if the
Northern Alliance breaks.

01:53:41.954 --> 01:53:45.657
<i>We have to get to Dostum first!
Head to Mazar!</i>

01:53:46.257 --> 01:53:47.793
Let's go!

01:54:40.311 --> 01:54:41.777
General, wait.

01:54:41.779 --> 01:54:43.048
General Atta.

01:55:17.047 --> 01:55:19.814
I will let Atta
have the city today.

01:55:19.816 --> 01:55:22.119
Tomorrow, we'll see.

01:55:23.488 --> 01:55:26.322
Well, you made
the right choice.

01:55:26.324 --> 01:55:30.792
Right choice? There are
no right choices here.

01:55:30.794 --> 01:55:36.465
This is Afghanistan.
Graveyard of many empires.

01:55:36.467 --> 01:55:41.237
Today you are our friend,
tomorrow you are our enemy.

01:55:41.239 --> 01:55:44.439
It won't be
any different for you.

01:55:44.441 --> 01:55:49.247
Soon America will become
just another tribe here.

01:55:51.583 --> 01:55:55.384
You will be cowards
if you leave.

01:55:55.386 --> 01:55:59.124
And you will be our enemies
if you stay.

01:56:02.526 --> 01:56:04.193
Just know

01:56:04.195 --> 01:56:07.031
that you will
always be my brother.

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:12.934
When I get into that city,
I will raise your flag.

01:56:12.936 --> 01:56:16.140
It's your city, General.
You raise your own flag.

01:56:17.175 --> 01:56:18.275
Here.

01:56:19.177 --> 01:56:21.609
It's been with me forever.

01:56:21.611 --> 01:56:23.981
- Now it's yours.
- Thank you.

01:56:37.294 --> 01:56:38.396
Yo.

01:56:40.797 --> 01:56:43.001
Thank you
for looking out for me.

01:56:48.073 --> 01:56:50.538
If you cry,
I'm telling everyone.

01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:52.741
Shut the fuck up, bro.

01:56:54.178 --> 01:56:55.713
Welcome back!

01:57:05.690 --> 01:57:08.157
Changed
the extraction site, huh?

01:57:08.159 --> 01:57:10.426
Yeah, I didn't think you'd
walked far enough.

01:57:10.428 --> 01:57:12.060
Yeah. I was thinking,
you know what,

01:57:12.062 --> 01:57:14.130
my knees feel way too good.

01:57:14.132 --> 01:57:15.930
- Well, they look good.
- Thanks.

01:57:15.932 --> 01:57:17.599
Did you see the medic?

01:57:17.601 --> 01:57:18.903
Yeah.

01:57:24.376 --> 01:57:26.541
Feels good, huh?

01:57:26.543 --> 01:57:30.011
What, sitting down? Awesome.

01:57:30.013 --> 01:57:32.083
No, I mean to finally
see one through.

01:57:34.785 --> 01:57:36.087
Yeah.

01:57:36.855 --> 01:57:38.420
Yeah.

01:57:38.422 --> 01:57:42.657
We won the battle, you know.
Still gotta win the war.

01:57:42.659 --> 01:57:45.961
Yeah. That ain't up to us.

01:57:45.963 --> 01:57:48.363
Ain't our job anyway
though, right?

01:57:48.365 --> 01:57:49.400
Yeah.

01:57:50.836 --> 01:57:53.271
So, where are you going
to point us to next?

01:57:54.172 --> 01:57:56.441
I'm pointing us home.

01:57:57.507 --> 01:57:59.010
I'll follow you there.

01:58:00.945 --> 01:58:03.215
I'll follow you anywhere.

01:58:05.050 --> 01:58:06.918
Thank God for that.

01:59:18.588 --> 01:59:20.389
Spencer?

01:59:20.391 --> 01:59:22.224
He's stable.
On his way to Germany.

01:59:22.226 --> 01:59:23.495
You got him here in time.

01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:28.898
Kept your promise.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:30.836
Yes, sir.

01:59:47.918 --> 01:59:49.585
That's beautiful, Maddy.

02:00:00.565 --> 02:00:03.401
Maddy! Come here!

02:00:04.269 --> 02:00:06.635
Look, Christmas came early!

02:00:06.637 --> 02:00:08.472
Daddy!
