Previously on "rescue me..."

00:02.120 --> 00:04.880
Wait,wait--promise me-- you've got to promise me

00:04.910 --> 00:06.450
that damian's going to get into your house

00:06.470 --> 00:07.840
and that you're going to keep watch over him.

00:07.870 --> 00:11.890
Yeah,I--listen,when he graduates,ok,

00:11.910 --> 00:14.130
he's stuck by my side.
He's stuck to me like glue.

00:14.150 --> 00:16.090
Hey,who's the babe frank's talking with?

00:16.110 --> 00:17.850
Oh,that's franco's friend.

00:17.870 --> 00:19.070
She's a total lesbo.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.060
You'll bust his hole,franco!

00:23.090 --> 00:24.240
Need I say more?

00:24.250 --> 00:25.960
When are they going to let you out of here?

00:25.980 --> 00:28.320
Doc wants to keep him around a few days.You know,just to be sure.

00:28.350 --> 00:30.130
It didn't look like you were going to make it there for a minute,homey.

00:30.150 --> 00:31.460
I'm saying a prayer for you every night.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.000
- We all were.
- Thanks.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.700
- I love you,sean.
- Hey,yeah--ok.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.450
How about that?That was--

00:37.480 --> 00:39.190
listen,a little help here,guys?

00:39.220 --> 00:41.000
Did you come with fire trucks?

00:41.020 --> 00:43.100
We should just take him down to the firehouse.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.850
I'm afraid he can't leave the hospital in his condition.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.940
Well,you know what?Maybe we can bring the trucks to you.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.820
I've never seen them so thrilled.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.590
Don't you guys have to get the trucks back?

00:54.610 --> 00:57.730
Oh,forget about that.It's against regulations,but it doesn't matter.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.690
I don't care if needles or anybody else finds out about this.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.360
Get in.We'll pretend like we're going to a fire.

01:02.380 --> 01:03.650
All right.Well,we'll pretend.

01:03.670 --> 01:06.180
That'll be cool,fun--cool.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.930
No,pretend!Dominic!

01:13.050 --> 01:15.020
Dominic,stop the truck!Dominic!

01:15.030 --> 01:16.330
Jesus christ!

Oh!Jeez.Ok.Thank you.Thank you for waiting.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.650
I always forget the goddamn camera.

01:34.670 --> 01:38.100
You know,the other day,after damian's graduation,we get home.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.170
He goes to bed,and then all of a sudden I realize,I didn't take one picture of him.

01:41.190 --> 01:42.390
- Right.
- Poor kid.

01:42.410 --> 01:44.480
I made him get up and put back on his class a'S.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.380
All right,come on,they're all in there.

01:45.410 --> 01:47.250
I need you to tell me that he's going to be ok.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.720
Listen,did I not get him into this firehouse,ok?You don't trust me?

01:50.750 --> 01:53.370
Look,this is the same firehouse that was on the cover

01:53.400 --> 01:56.130
of "the post" last week.Let's see,what was it?

01:56.160 --> 01:58.500
- "Cancer boy smokes bravest."
- Ok.

01:58.530 --> 01:59.980
It's "the new york post," all right?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Second of all,he couldn't be in a safer firehouse,ok?

02:02.020 --> 02:05.180
It's like getting hit by lightning,or,you know,eaten by a shark.

02:05.210 --> 02:09.080
The chances of it happening again here--it's like a million to one.

02:10.340 --> 02:13.350
10 million to one.
It's like 10 million to one,ok?

02:13.370 --> 02:15.870
Listen,

02:15.900 --> 02:18.050
him being here--

02:18.080 --> 02:21.380
It's not what I want,ok?
But it's what he wants.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.590
And so I am busting butt trying to

02:24.610 --> 02:28.240
be all supportive and happy and shit,but you--I need you

02:28.260 --> 02:30.440
to tell me that everything's going to be ok

02:30.470 --> 02:34.850
so that I don't go out of my goddamn mind with worry.

02:34.910 --> 02:37.450
I need you to tell me that he's not going to get hurt.

02:37.470 --> 02:39.620
Sheila,he's a goddamn fireman now,ok?

02:39.640 --> 02:41.340
I mean,he's going to get hurt.He's--ow!

02:41.360 --> 02:43.410
He's going to get,you know,banged up,but--

02:43.430 --> 02:44.600
Hey!

02:44.620 --> 02:47.340
- Don't--don't you hit me again.
- Then don't say that again.

02:47.370 --> 02:50.340
He won't get burnt.
That's the best I can do.

02:53.150 --> 02:54.980
Jesus christ.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.680
Look,it's not just me saying it.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.250
You know that if jimmy were here,

02:58.280 --> 03:01.340
he would be saying the same thing to you.He would say,

03:01.370 --> 03:03.820
"just watch after my kid.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.350
" Stay close to him.

03:05.370 --> 03:08.110
I'm--I'm doing that.

03:08.130 --> 03:11.780
Don't you think he'd be really proud today?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.060
Oh,boy.Yes,he would be really proud.Now,

03:14.090 --> 03:15.940
you got to get in that kitchen.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.070
Because lou's been in there in that cave for about 10 minutes,

03:18.090 --> 03:21.420
and believe me,that is 10 minutes too long.

03:21.450 --> 03:23.520
Ok,all right,squeeze in,mikey.

03:23.550 --> 03:24.770
- A little more.
- Come on.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.420
- A little more.
- A little more.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.260
Ok,get ready to smile.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.700
- Everyone say "V.D.
- " V.D.!

03:30.720 --> 03:31.870
Oh--wait,wait,i didn't--

03:31.890 --> 03:33.420
- just another one!
- No,no,no.

03:33.450 --> 03:36.470
I've been in this room with the cake for,like,10 minutes and I haven't eaten it yet.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.300
It's completely unnatural.All right?

03:38.320 --> 03:39.960
- Blow them out,big guy.
- Let her take another.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.770
- All right,yay!
- Yay!

03:44.770 --> 03:45.850
Congratulations,probie.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.090
You're now officially a member of the brotherhood of dysfunctional action junkies.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.960
It is going to be an honor and a privilege

03:50.990 --> 03:52.850
to make your life a living hell every day--

03:52.870 --> 03:54.540
- Yes.
- For the next year.

03:54.570 --> 03:57.850
John,I hope that you're not talking about hazing.

03:57.870 --> 04:02.000
Because in this day and age,I think it's something that the department would frown upon.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.120
Mom,stop.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.120
Hazing is a rite of passage.
I wouldn't be a real firefighter without it.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.690
You know,damian,that is a very mature attitude you're displaying.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.820
I'm happy to hear you say that.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.290
You just keep that in mind when we treat you to a walk with fido.

04:13.130 --> 04:14.350
What's that one again,frank?

04:14.370 --> 04:16.870
That's when you go out on the sidewalk and you find a nice steaming lump of dog shit

04:16.899 --> 04:19.149
and you put it in the guy's boots and then hope for a really long call

04:19.170 --> 04:20.920
so you can watch him walk around in shit the whole time.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.000
- Or of course,the san diego charger.
- oh.

04:24.020 --> 04:27.150
When they replace the bath mat with the electrical blanket and

04:27.180 --> 04:30.200
when the guy gets out of the shower and steps on and gets shocked?

04:30.220 --> 04:31.520
- No,that's the san quentin.
- Are you sure?

04:31.540 --> 04:34.340
Isn't the san quentin when you attach a car battery to a metal chair,

04:34.360 --> 04:36.480
and make it the only place where a guy can sit for lunch?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.610
No,no,that's the jumper seat.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.580
Oh,jumper seat--yeah,yeah.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.650
You guys,there's too many of these.
You're making me sweat.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.680
No,there's not really that many.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.060
There's the shits and giggles,there's the toledo wake up call.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.440
Oh,that's a classic.
Of course,the spic 'n span.

04:47.470 --> 04:48.460
What's the spic 'n span?

04:48.470 --> 04:50.590
- Oh,the bald and the beautiful.
- Oh,yes!

04:50.610 --> 04:52.060
Why,what's that?
Why,what is that?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.440
What is it?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.990
The bald and beautiful is,

04:55.010 --> 04:58.330
you take a guy's shampoo and empty it out and refill it with nair.

04:58.350 --> 05:01.700
So when he's--

05:01.720 --> 05:03.180
we don't really do that one anymore.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.430
- We kind of cast that one out.
- Yeah,right,right.

05:04.460 --> 05:07.630
It's not cool.And my pubes didn't grow back for,like,two months.

05:07.650 --> 05:09.220
Like a 10-year-old boy.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.550
That was the only time your looks actually matched your intellect.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.970
Ok!I think that this has been super fun,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.530
but I'm going to go to church now and start praying.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.820
Oh,mama,don't leave yet.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.980
Don't me here with the baby boy.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.770
I thought you were going to come out on a couple of runs with us,hang out for a couple days.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.700
You're so funny--no!I'm fine.

05:24.730 --> 05:28.520
Because I know that damian is in good hands.

05:28.540 --> 05:31.240
And he's being watched over by a great bunch of guys.

05:31.260 --> 05:33.060
- And tommy.
- And tommy.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.520
So funny.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.670
Hey,look,he is now officially part of the family,

05:37.690 --> 05:39.380
and you are in capable hands.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.930
And I think we got tommy a little something.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.380
Yes,we do.

05:43.410 --> 05:50.470
We have your dad's spare bunker jacket which he wore

05:50.510 --> 05:51.880
several times as his backup.

05:51.910 --> 05:55.720
But now,it is officially yours.He would have

05:55.750 --> 05:57.560
been proud.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.630
Yeah.Jimmy would be real proud.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.120
- Jimmy is proud.
- We all are.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.060
Oh,his mother's crying.

06:03.090 --> 06:05.160
- That's not why we did it.
- I'm ok.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.750
He can take another picture now.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.910
No,no,no,sheila,I'll take the picture.You get in,come on.

06:08.930 --> 06:10.040
Ok.
I got it,I got it.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.500
- I don't know if I wound it.
- No,I got it,I got it,i got it.

06:13.410 --> 06:15.250
- You ok?
- Ah,there it is.

06:15.270 --> 06:16.540
Franco,move your big head.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.400
Let mikey get in,come on.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.540
Ok.Ok,tommy,look up.Look up.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.010
And one,two--

06:23.030 --> 06:24.690
yeah!

06:24.720 --> 06:27.330
It's going to go really well on your living room wall,sheila.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.040
- Thank you,honey.
- Yeah,no problem.

06:29.070 --> 06:30.930
Ok,you guys.

06:30.950 --> 06:34.240
Now,damian,you be safe.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.000
And I will see you tonight,ok?

06:36.010 --> 06:36.960
No,none of that stuff.

06:36.990 --> 06:39.330
- Come on.
- Oh,no,no,you guys.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.360
It's ok.
It's totally ok.

06:43.950 --> 06:45.180
Ok.
All right,guys,bye.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.870
- See you,sheil.
- Bye.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.850
So nice of your mother to stop by.

06:49.650 --> 06:53.460
All right,kids,the party's over,I'm afraid.It's time to suit up.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.630
And let's get some work done around here.

06:55.650 --> 06:56.450
Yeah.

06:56.470 --> 06:59.400
But first,here is to damian!

06:59.420 --> 07:01.420
- Oh!
- Yes!

07:01.450 --> 07:02.970
- To damian!
- To damian!

07:02.990 --> 07:03.930
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

07:03.960 --> 07:05.530
- To damian!
- Yes!

07:05.550 --> 07:07.070
- To damo!
- Damo!

07:10.720 --> 07:12.560
I got a el duble.

07:12.580 --> 07:15.940
- Oh!
- Yeah!

07:15.960 --> 07:17.250
- Yeah,nice and pretty.
- Nice.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.460
Wait,wait,wait.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.530
Oh.Oh,no.Oh!

07:20.550 --> 07:22.810
To damian!
Yes,yes!

07:22.830 --> 07:25.980
Let's get at.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.040
There you go.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.270
To damian!
Come on,damian.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.230
- Have some fun.
- There you go.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.170
Have some fun.

07:33.190 --> 07:34.550
Oh!

07:34.570 --> 07:37.100
Pistachios,peanuts,yeah?

07:37.120 --> 07:38.520
Come on.
Come on.

07:38.540 --> 07:48.860
Cake,cake,cake,cake!

07:48.880 --> 07:51.510
Yeah!

07:52.200 --> 07:53.580
Nice!

07:55.030 --> 07:56.770
That was a good one,probie.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.720
- Very nice.
- Yeah,probie!

07:58.740 --> 08:00.910
I knew it.
Making dad proud.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.410
- Thank you.
- The good stuff.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.140
All right.
Now--uh¡ª

08:06.770 --> 08:09.040
- Clean up all this shit.
- Yep.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.240
What?

08:10.250 --> 08:14.190
No,it's--no questions,probie.Clean it up.

08:14.210 --> 08:17.430
Now,punk.Bee-atch.

08:19.740 --> 08:22.570
Hey,welcome to the 62 truck,kid.

08:22.590 --> 08:28.150
Um--this is called the spic 'n span,by the way.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.090
Minus the spic.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.280
I really got to clean this all up?

08:34.309 --> 08:36.140
Yep.

08:36.169 --> 08:37.559
Don't worry,it could be worse.

08:37.590 --> 08:39.600
How?

09:56.700 --> 10:01.040
It's a brass ring about 7 inches in diameter with an adjustable clasp on one side.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.700
Are you actually telling me you made it all the way through probie school

10:03.720 --> 10:05.930
without seeing a universal hose coupler?

10:05.950 --> 10:07.970
Lou,I searched through the entire basement.

10:07.990 --> 10:09.680
I didn't see anything matching that description.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.390
Well,then you know what,damian?Search again.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.080
And don't come back to me until you find one,ok?

10:14.110 --> 10:16.630
All right.Is this one of those wild goose chase things

10:16.670 --> 10:19.740
where it doesn't really exist and you're just busting my balls?

10:19.770 --> 10:22.750
Well,well,well,you know what,damian?

10:22.780 --> 10:24.050
You caught me.

10:24.070 --> 10:26.700
So,what do we do now?I know.

10:26.730 --> 10:28.000
Why don't you leave me your boots

10:28.020 --> 10:31.150
and then go out onto the street and find me a big pile of dog shit?

10:32.100 --> 10:33.310
I'll keep looking for the coupler.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.900
That's a good choice.

10:34.930 --> 10:37.340
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

10:39.210 --> 10:42.540
- Universal hose coupler?
- Always a favorite.I love it.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.270
Hey,lou,did you get a call about this johnny bones thing tomorrow night?

10:46.290 --> 10:48.860
Oh,yeah,7:00 way out in brooklyn someplace?

10:48.890 --> 10:50.670
What,are they dedicating something to him?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.830
Yeah,like a banquet hall or something like that,you know.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.610
Yeah,that's great.A guy dies 9/11,it takes them like 8 years to get a memorial together.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.530
Yeah,probably being organized by the same bunch of dipshits

10:58.560 --> 10:59.870
who are putting up the freedom tower.

10:59.890 --> 11:00.850
You know,at the rate that thing's going,

11:00.880 --> 11:03.070
they're going to have to dig us out of our graves to go to the unveiling.

11:03.090 --> 11:05.150
I guess we should make an appearance,though,to show our respect.

11:05.180 --> 11:08.050
Yeah.You know,those things are always just swelling with assholes,though.

11:08.070 --> 11:10.910
Yeah.But you remember his--his widow,kim--kimmy?

11:10.940 --> 11:11.760
Oh,yeah,yeah.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.480
Well,you know she's going to be there.

11:13.510 --> 11:14.860
And the word is,

11:14.880 --> 11:16.630
she took a big chunk of that widow money

11:16.660 --> 11:19.060
and bought herself some tits to match that ass.

11:20.060 --> 11:21.350
We should probably go,yeah.

11:21.370 --> 11:24.160
Just--just,you know,just for the-- hey,chief.

11:24.190 --> 11:26.510
Half a day today,chief?

11:26.530 --> 11:29.070
What's that supposed to mean,asshole?

11:29.090 --> 11:32.440
Um--nothing,just being not funny,I guess.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.490
Yeah.Well,I'm a little late getting to the house,

11:34.520 --> 11:38.410
but I was right on time for my 7:30 reaming down at headquarters.

11:38.430 --> 11:39.530
It's funny,they're still a little miffed

11:39.560 --> 11:42.830
about the whole cancer kid stealing one of our vehicles things.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.750
They're looking for someone's head to be served up.

11:44.780 --> 11:47.940
I'm just trying to figure out who that's going to be.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.050
Keep writing,lou.
I'm thinking gavin.

11:54.110 --> 11:55.330
Hey.

11:55.350 --> 11:58.700
Oh,hey.I just heard damian swearing a blue streak down in the basement.

11:58.730 --> 12:00.550
The old universal hose coupling?

12:00.570 --> 12:02.550
- Correct.
- I remember that one.

12:02.570 --> 12:05.420
Yeah.We just pulled it on you last week.What's this?

12:05.440 --> 12:08.980
Oh,it's a benefit for gary to help him out with his medical expenses.

12:09.010 --> 12:10.480
At the bar this saturday night,

12:10.500 --> 12:12.530
my band's playing.We're totally going to rock.

12:12.550 --> 12:14.440
You're not putting these up outside the house,are you?

12:14.470 --> 12:16.150
Yeah,jesus christ.
Exactly what we need.

12:16.180 --> 12:19.400
Like,advertising for our totally illegal under the table joint.

12:19.430 --> 12:23.000
No,no,they're just for us guys,and a few guys at other houses who know sean,you know?

12:23.030 --> 12:24.770
Check it out,dude.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.750
Apache stone?

12:27.780 --> 12:29.000
Yep.That's my band.

12:29.020 --> 12:31.860
It sounds like a native american gift shop in tucson.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.810
Yeah,or maybe a casino in connecticut.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.240
Guys,we're actually called apache stone

12:36.260 --> 12:38.400
because I have native american blood running through my veins.

12:38.430 --> 12:40.360
Yeah,and retard blood running through your brain.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.600
All through the brain.

12:41.620 --> 12:44.460
No,no,I'm serious,guys.
I'm like 2% northeast apache.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.550
Like,my mom traced her bloodline on the internet.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.180
You're native american?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.860
Yeah,but only like 2%,so

12:49.890 --> 12:51.670
what does that come out to?What part of you?

12:51.700 --> 12:53.130
Well,maybe one ball.

12:53.150 --> 12:56.440
You should rename the band and call it "cherokee testicle.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.480
" "Pawnee nut boys.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.230
" Yeah,yeah,you guys can laugh all you want,but wait till you hear us play.

13:01.250 --> 13:04.230
Yeah,you know,he's right.We should probably save this laughter till we hear him play.

13:04.260 --> 13:06.950
I suggest we pack the place full of totally hot chicks,though.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.920
It's the only thing that's going to keep it from completely clearing out

13:08.960 --> 13:11.800
as soon as comanche ball sack starts playing.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.120
You know what,frank?
That's not a bad idea,actually.

13:14.150 --> 13:16.980
Maybe you could have your girlfriend invite some of her friends.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.230
You know,I'm sure she's got some hot fillies in her stable,right?

13:19.260 --> 13:20.810
Yeah,a couple of bulls,too,I think.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.990
Carla's not a dyke,lou.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.020
No,frank,of course she's not.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.770
But you know,if she is--

13:26.790 --> 13:29.920
i mean,frank says he's getting the best sex of his life with this chick,right?

13:29.940 --> 13:31.960
And if she's straight,then cool.

13:31.980 --> 13:34.610
- She invites some straight friends.
- Carla's not gay.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.410
You guys got any doubts,you can ask my cock,ok?

13:36.430 --> 13:38.840
No,no,frank,of course she isn't,dude.

13:38.870 --> 13:41.510
But you know,if she is,then what,she invites a bunch of hot lesbos,

13:41.530 --> 13:44.540
and we all get a shot at getting some of that hot sex frankie's getting,right?

13:44.560 --> 13:46.070
It's a win-win,man.

13:46.090 --> 13:47.780
Some nasty lesbo ass.

13:47.810 --> 13:50.060
You know,I'd appreciate it if you guys cut the crap.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.610
I finally find a woman I'm happy about and,

13:52.630 --> 13:54.430
you know,I'd like a little support from my brothers,if you don't mind.

13:54.450 --> 13:58.570
Franco,we're all excited about you and carla,but come on,man.

13:58.590 --> 14:00.860
You got to admit,your boo is a little butch.

14:00.890 --> 14:03.490
A little?Christ,if her testosterone ever blows,

14:03.520 --> 14:06.080
we're going to have to get red adair in here to cap it.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.440
Red adair?

14:07.460 --> 14:09.030
You know,john wayne played him in a movie.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.400
- John wayne?
- Yo!

14:10.540 --> 14:11.690
Hey,hey.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.480
Hey.

14:13.490 --> 14:14.780
They finally let you out,huh?

14:14.810 --> 14:17.290
Well,you know,I was going to stay a couple extra days in the hospital,

14:17.300 --> 14:19.260
but I figured i can't afford it,so,you know--

14:19.290 --> 14:20.340
I got to sit down now.

14:20.370 --> 14:21.220
Oh,yeah.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.430
So what's up,man?
When are you coming back to work?

14:23.460 --> 14:24.570
Soon,I think.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.640
The doctors said I got to take two weeks' rest at home,

14:26.670 --> 14:27.900
and then another couple weeks to,you know,

14:27.920 --> 14:30.270
get my strength back at the gym and whatnot.But soon.

14:30.290 --> 14:32.760
Well,do you think maybe you should go home and rest up,dude?

14:32.780 --> 14:34.220
You know,you don't want to overdo it.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.400
No,bro.I mean,that's just it.I mean,I--you know,

14:36.420 --> 14:38.400
this whole experience has made me realize,

14:38.430 --> 14:40.470
I'm going to totally overdo it from now on.

14:40.490 --> 14:43.000
I'm just going to live my life bigger,you know?

14:43.030 --> 14:44.740
- Second chance,right?
- Yeah,yeah.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.590
I mean,as tired as I am,and

14:46.620 --> 14:48.110
as much as this whole thing has beat me up,

14:48.140 --> 14:49.450
i wish you guys could be me right now.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.560
Because I'm telling you,when they rolled me out of the hospital in that wheelchair,

14:52.590 --> 14:57.810
and I looked up at that beautiful blue sky,I stared at it like it was a

14:57.830 --> 15:02.380
giant naked picture of jessica alba.

15:04.150 --> 15:06.840
Well,I wish we were,dude.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.200
And I took this breath in,right?

15:12.230 --> 15:16.910
And the air tasted so sweet and good and thick,and i just--

15:16.940 --> 15:18.630
I started crying,you know?

15:18.650 --> 15:19.790
Weird.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.110
And I thought to myself,"oh,great,I'm going to be that guy that cries now,

15:22.140 --> 15:23.940
like when the wind blows."

15:23.960 --> 15:25.540
But that's not why I'm crying.I'm crying

15:25.560 --> 15:28.030
because I've been living my life so small.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.190
You know?And I'm tired of that.I'm going to

15:30.220 --> 15:31.880
live it to the fullest,you know what I mean?

15:31.900 --> 15:33.710
And I'm not talking about being something other than a firefighter.

15:33.740 --> 15:37.330
I love what we do.I'm just saying,you know,I want to do

15:37.350 --> 15:39.410
more and--and live better,

15:39.440 --> 15:44.950
and be that firefighter,that guy,that friend,that everything,you know?

15:44.970 --> 15:47.860
I mean,god forbid the cancer comes back,or we all burn up in a fire,

15:47.880 --> 15:49.900
I want to be able to say to myself as the lights go out,

15:49.930 --> 15:51.720
"you know what?I didn't live a perfect life.

15:51.740 --> 15:54.630
But hey,

15:54.660 --> 15:57.700
I lived that bitch to the fullest."

15:57.720 --> 16:00.110
- Wow. - Wow.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.220
You ok?

16:05.240 --> 16:07.430
Yeah,I just talked a lot.
I was really--I'm tired.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.280
Oh,here,man,have a smoke.
It'll make you feel better.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.390
Oh,that'll be great.

16:10.420 --> 16:11.340
- Yeah.
- Thanks,pal.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.650
Oh,yeah,baby.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.390
Bam.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.240
It's good to be alive.

16:19.270 --> 16:21.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah,yeah!

16:27.300 --> 16:29.340
Well,this is it.We're taking off.
You going to be ok?

16:29.370 --> 16:30.700
Yeah,yeah,I think so.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.390
As long as I don't get cancer again.

16:32.410 --> 16:34.720
Yeah,well,you know,not to bring you down or anything,

16:34.740 --> 16:36.840
but you know,considering the type of cancer you had,

16:36.870 --> 16:41.050
and the Of ground zero,the chances of you having a reoccurrence are pretty strong.

16:41.080 --> 16:45.850
Yeah--anyway,listen,I broke the dot selector on the toaster.

16:45.870 --> 16:47.910
You know,I know money's been a little tight,

16:47.940 --> 16:49.900
so I left you 5 bucks on the counter to cover it.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.060
You know,between you and I,I think it was going to break,anyway.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.940
I figure it's the least I can do for my kid brother.

16:53.970 --> 16:56.880
So--hey,it's good to see you.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.620
Ok,bro.

17:01.570 --> 17:02.690
What's he doing,ma?

17:02.720 --> 17:03.720
It's like a trap or something?

17:03.740 --> 17:05.650
Calm down.
He just wants a hug.

17:05.670 --> 17:06.740
- From me?
- Yeah.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.250
Yeah,from you.
Come on,man.Jesus.

17:09.690 --> 17:10.430
Go ahead.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.410
Jesus--I think we're getting out just in time,ma.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.720
- Come on.
- Yeah,whatever.Fine.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.790
Thanks for coming.

17:17.420 --> 17:18.579
- Hey!
- Whoa,what's the matter?

17:18.599 --> 17:19.319
What the hell are you doing?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.339
That was lovely.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.119
What are you talking about?

17:21.140 --> 17:23.599
You bumped me with your package.
You don't package bump when you hug.

17:23.630 --> 17:25.960
I didn't package bump you.
What the hell are you talking about?

17:25.980 --> 17:27.849
You're supposed to pull your package back when you hug a man.

17:27.869 --> 17:29.480
My package was pulled back,ok?

17:29.510 --> 17:31.140
Yeah,why don't you try reading the manual once in a while?

17:31.170 --> 17:33.230
The manual?I was--my hips were all out,man.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.380
- I didn't touch you--
- You didn't pull your pelvis back!

17:34.400 --> 17:35.970
That's what you're supposed to do,you dick weed.

17:35.990 --> 17:37.430
You know what?
Just take your shit and go.

17:37.460 --> 17:39.440
You're unbelievable.You know what?
You're just a dick.

17:39.470 --> 17:40.240
Get out.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.030
Don't let the door hit you on the way out,jerk off.

17:42.050 --> 17:43.000
See you,squirt.

17:43.030 --> 17:44.770
Ok,yeah,with your fruity shopping bags.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.700
"Oh,look at me,I got cancer.Help.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.650
" I don't care what he says.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.210
It did my heart good seeing you boys be sweet like that.

17:55.230 --> 17:56.460
Oh,yeah?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.250
Do I need to pee one more time?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.200
Nah,I'm good.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.010
- Take care,kid.
- All right,ma.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.010
Hey,ma,there's something I want to say to you.I just--

18:05.040 --> 18:07.900
I--I--now that I'm feeling clearheaded,i think I'm just going to

18:07.920 --> 18:09.490
come right out and say it.

18:09.930 --> 18:11.980
I know that you love terrence more than you love me,ok?

18:12.010 --> 18:14.040
And you don't have to say anything,because it's clear,ok?

18:14.060 --> 18:15.390
And i don't know why that is.

18:15.410 --> 18:17.580
Maybe it's because,you know,he's a big baby,

18:17.610 --> 18:19.080
even though he's smart and all that stuff.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.570
Or maybe it's because he stayed and I didn't,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.680
or he needs you more than I do.I don't know what it is.

18:23.710 --> 18:26.900
Or maybe it's because you're getting older and you realize that as you get older,

18:26.920 --> 18:28.340
you're going to need him as much as he needs you.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.530
I--it doesn't matter.

18:29.550 --> 18:32.580
I just want you to know that I'm aware of it,

18:32.600 --> 18:34.340
and I'm ok with it.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.810
- Sean--
- Yeah.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.200
- You're right.
- Good,good.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.130
Really?

18:41.150 --> 18:42.460
I'm sorry.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.930
I love terrence much more than I love you.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.570
Yeah.
Well,much more?

18:46.590 --> 18:48.900
I mean,I was thinking it would be like a little bit more.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.140
Jesus,it feels good to have it out in the open!

18:51.170 --> 18:53.200
- Now it's my turn!
- Great,ok.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.780
- Oy!
- Yeah.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.960
Hey,don't listen to your brother.
You know how to hug just fine.

18:57.990 --> 18:59.720
- Thanks.
- And don't look for that $5.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.630
I took it for cigarettes for the drive.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.280
- Ok.
- Later,sweetheart.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.680
All right,ma.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.330
Thanks for coming.
I'll call you.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.000
I'm going to try this one on.

19:10.020 --> 19:11.840
- Cool.
- Oh,yeah.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.320
Can I try the blue one,too,mom?

19:13.340 --> 19:15.250
Yeah,honey.
Honey,try them both.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.400
Ok.Ok,we'll be waiting right here.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.280
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.020
- Yes,she just called me mom.
- I know.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.780
Not mommy.
I am mom again.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.860
She's coming back to us.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.950
Yep.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.320
Congratulations,mom.

19:29.340 --> 19:32.290
Uh--not now,big boy.
We don't have time.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.390
Oh,you know what?

19:33.420 --> 19:35.750
Unless we were to sneak into one of the changing rooms

19:35.780 --> 19:37.680
and I was to give her a bunch of dresses.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.860
We could have a quickie.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.300
But,like,a real "quickie" quickie.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.030
I'm--I'm fine with that.

19:43.050 --> 19:45.230
I just was actually just giving you a hug.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.630
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.140
Oh,oh.Because,you know,I just--

19:49.160 --> 19:51.670
I thought that it was like a sexy hug.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.100
No,it was just a hug.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.950
You know,like a "hug" hug.

19:55.960 --> 20:00.170
Yeah--I don't--we don't--

20:00.190 --> 20:02.790
you know what?Let's just forget the "hug" hugs,ok?

20:02.820 --> 20:04.450
- Ok.
- Ok.

20:04.480 --> 20:07.540
I just thought,you know,since we're kind of

20:07.560 --> 20:09.650
doing it again,it might be nice to

20:09.680 --> 20:12.580
throw in a hug or a "hug" hug,you know,every once in a while,and--

20:12.610 --> 20:15.420
Hey,tommy,forget the goddamn hugs,ok?

20:15.440 --> 20:17.150
We are being nice to each other

20:17.180 --> 20:19.630
to gain back our daughter's love and affection.

20:19.650 --> 20:25.150
This--we're having sex because it is mutually pleasurable,right?

20:25.170 --> 20:26.640
- Yeah.
- Great.

20:29.780 --> 20:33.720
I just,you know--i mean,

20:33.740 --> 20:37.050
if we're having sex,we could also be affectionate to each other.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.490
Oh,god,no,tommy.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.990
No,if you were affectionate with me,I might actually start liking you.

20:42.010 --> 20:45.210
And then we're going to go down that same old trap again.

20:46.350 --> 20:48.090
All right,wait--you want to explain that?

20:48.110 --> 20:51.260
We're having sex,but you--you don't like me?

20:51.270 --> 20:54.950
Well,after everything we've been through,do you even have to ask?

20:54.970 --> 20:57.980
Yeah,I do.I mean--

20:58.750 --> 21:00.750
you haven't--we're having sex.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.900
But you don't like me?

21:02.920 --> 21:05.410
- That's what you--
- Which makes it better.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.480
All right.

21:08.510 --> 21:09.960
That's bullshit.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.100
You have to like me.

21:12.120 --> 21:17.090
Oh,ok,well,tommy,of course,ok?
Of course I like you.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.570
I do.

21:18.590 --> 21:22.040
You know,I just--i don't "like you" like you.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.740
You know what it is?
I love you,I love you.

21:24.760 --> 21:28.210
In a deep and cavernous way.

21:28.240 --> 21:36.910
You know,that is streamlined with ribbons of hate--

21:36.940 --> 21:39.190
and disdain.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.730
Yeah?

21:40.750 --> 21:42.710
And you know,resentment.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.800
Ok?But I am focusing right now on the sex.

21:45.820 --> 21:49.000
- Because the sex is great.
- Yeah.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.710
Ok?So let's just forget all about the,like,

21:50.730 --> 21:53.260
the love and the hugs and the ribbons and the hate,

21:53.290 --> 21:59.480
and let's focus on the hot,steamy,sneaky sex.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.690
Ok?

22:02.620 --> 22:04.580
- Yeah.
- Ok.

22:04.610 --> 22:06.050
So do you want to go in there

22:06.080 --> 22:11.780
and scope out the changing rooms while I get about 15 dresses for her to try on,or not?

22:11.800 --> 22:12.830
Well,of course.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.860
- Ok,ok.
- Ok.

22:16.590 --> 22:17.460
Hey.

22:17.490 --> 22:21.070
This is the one,mom.
This is the one I want.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.060
This is it.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.210
That's--that's great.

22:23.230 --> 22:24.630
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:24.650 --> 22:25.480
Ok.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.630
Come on,let's go pay for it.

22:26.660 --> 22:28.960
- All right.
- Ok.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.880
Holy shit.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.340
Hey,hello,tommy!

22:38.370 --> 22:40.090
- Tommy!
- Hey.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.560
- How you guys doing?
- Yeah!

22:41.580 --> 22:43.250
- What's going on?
- Hey,nothing.

22:43.270 --> 22:44.730
Last time i checked,this was a party,right?

22:44.750 --> 22:46.680
That's right,yeah.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.800
Why don't you guys just slow it down a little bit,huh?

22:48.820 --> 22:51.440
- Oh,ain't no slowing down.
- Nah,none of that.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.580
We're living life the sean garrity way.

22:53.610 --> 22:57.210
You don't do it small,you do that shit b-I-g--big sign.

22:57.230 --> 22:58.580
No regrets,man.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.570
A sky full of jessica alba.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.830
Yeah.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.250
A sky full of jessica alba's ass.

23:04.270 --> 23:07.270
- Skate,skate,bang,bang--
- bitches!

23:08.330 --> 23:10.190
Yeah,well,she does have a nice,little--

23:10.210 --> 23:12.100
Yeah.Good luck with that,boys.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.690
It's round.

23:18.420 --> 23:21.710
- Did you work with bonesy?
- No.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.770
Friend of the family?

23:25.530 --> 23:27.390
You could say.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.570
I say forget the family.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.860
I wouldn't mind being a friend of kim'S.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.770
I mean,I know she's remarried.

23:33.790 --> 23:36.750
But I mean,who wouldn't mind having that ass?

23:36.770 --> 23:38.820
And those new boobs?

23:38.840 --> 23:42.780
I mean,talking about widow money being well spent,jesus christ.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.790
You know,

23:44.820 --> 23:49.010
instead of hanging that stupid plaque on the wall in some shitty banquet hall,

23:49.040 --> 23:50.420
i think that they should hang it

23:50.450 --> 23:52.230
right underneath that rack of hers,

23:52.250 --> 23:54.820
so whoever the lucky bastard is who's drilling her

23:54.860 --> 24:00.190
knows whose blood,sweat,and tears,and life he owes

24:00.210 --> 24:04.240
for that magnificent new set of tetons.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.260
You're the new husband,aren't you?

24:14.100 --> 24:16.650
Nice talking to you.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.840
Hey.

24:18.870 --> 24:20.170
Hey.

24:20.190 --> 24:22.730
Hey,can I get a bushmills?
Two fingers,please.

24:24.220 --> 24:25.020
How are you doing?

24:25.050 --> 24:27.560
Great,I'm making a complete dick hole of myself.

24:27.580 --> 24:29.370
Good.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.670
Bonesy's wife is really showing off the new tits,huh?

24:32.690 --> 24:36.400
Yeah,well,you know,don't let her new husband hear you say that.

24:36.430 --> 24:38.180
You said something about the new tits to--

24:38.210 --> 24:39.740
I didn't,not really.

24:39.770 --> 24:43.260
Well,I didn't mention the word "tits" or "titties.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.470
" You said "tetons," didn't you?

24:44.480 --> 24:45.420
How do you know these things?

24:45.450 --> 24:48.750
- Yeah,I just--where's the plaque at?
- It's over here.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.350
They did a pretty good job on--nice picture.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.490
Oh,that's nice.

24:53.510 --> 24:55.510
Wow.

24:55.530 --> 24:57.070
Yeah.This is awesome.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.660
The flowers are fake,though.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.360
- You're kidding me.
- No.

25:00.390 --> 25:03.640
What,she has no money left after she got the new nipples?

25:03.660 --> 25:04.600
Who could blame her?

25:04.630 --> 25:08.050
Hey,guys--guys,can we ask you to step away from this area?

25:08.070 --> 25:10.360
We're shooting some footage and we want to see that sign in the background.

25:10.390 --> 25:12.840
- Oh,sure.Yeah,yeah,yeah.Sorry.
- Thanks.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.660
Are you--what,are you shooting something for the--

25:14.680 --> 25:15.870
shooting something for the family?

25:15.900 --> 25:17.730
Sort of.
It's a news thing.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.340
Oh,what are you,a reporter?

25:19.370 --> 25:22.980
No.Hi,I'm dick gerard,state representative for this district.

25:23.010 --> 25:23.880
- Hey.
- Nice to meet to you.

25:23.900 --> 25:24.700
Nice to meet you.
How are you?

25:24.720 --> 25:26.110
- Oh,he's a politician.
- Yeah.

25:26.140 --> 25:29.030
You know,what memorial service would be complete without one?

25:29.050 --> 25:31.270
Yeah.
You knew johnny bones?

25:31.290 --> 25:33.230
Uh--I don't know who you mean.

25:33.250 --> 25:36.900
Johnny bohannan.
His name's on the plaque.

25:36.930 --> 25:40.320
Well,sadly,I--I never met the man.

25:40.340 --> 25:44.050
Well,you know what?
Wherever he is,I'm sure he's real torn up about that.

25:44.760 --> 25:48.460
Do you know what firehouse he served out of,or how many kids he had,

25:48.480 --> 25:52.820
or any personal or pertinent information about the guy?No?

25:52.830 --> 25:55.770
Maybe we should find another spot.

25:55.790 --> 25:57.700
Yeah,maybe you should,because I'll tell you something.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.050
We're firemen,ok?

25:59.070 --> 26:01.520
So,we've been through this drill before with politicians.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.560
And we understand exactly what's going on.

26:03.580 --> 26:04.340
You're firemen?

26:04.360 --> 26:05.090
- Yeah.
- Yes.

26:05.110 --> 26:05.470
Oh,great.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.400
Well,why don't we get the camera started here and

26:08.420 --> 26:11.130
we can get the 3 of us having a serious discussion

26:11.160 --> 26:12.880
about the issues that you guys are facing?

26:12.910 --> 26:13.550
Oh,good.

26:13.570 --> 26:16.640
Yeah,well,I'm glad you turned the camera on,because you know what?

26:16.660 --> 26:19.620
In about a minute,I'm going to stick that camera right up your ass,ok?

26:19.640 --> 26:22.800
So you can kind of perform your own little colonoscopy,you know what I mean?

26:22.830 --> 26:24.420
Yeah,you know,guys like you--I love you.

26:24.460 --> 26:25.700
What,are you running for office again?

26:25.730 --> 26:27.390
You got to get reelected or something?
You need some votes?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.490
Is that what this whole camera--

26:28.510 --> 26:30.080
'cause you know,you guys are always doing this.

26:30.100 --> 26:33.210
You know,9/11,after--they always came down and said hello to us and everything else.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.320
We thought you were our best friends.

26:34.350 --> 26:35.820
We thought we--maybe we'd get a pay raise.

26:35.840 --> 26:38.070
Maybe,you know,whatever,but we got nothing,ok?

26:38.090 --> 26:40.640
You guys are all the same.
Why don't you turn the goddamn camera off,ok?

26:40.660 --> 26:41.830
Wait,no,no,no,no.
Keep it rolling.

26:41.860 --> 26:42.890
No,seriously,turn the camera off.

26:42.910 --> 26:44.260
- No,no,no,keep it--
- What,what?

26:44.290 --> 26:45.890
- Look,you're a fireman,right?
- Yeah.

26:45.910 --> 26:47.460
And--what was your name again?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.450
Tommy gavin,62 truck.

26:49.470 --> 26:51.760
No,it's ok,lou.
It's fine.Don't worry about it.

26:51.780 --> 26:56.310
Tommy--tommy--look,fellas,I know you're angry.

26:56.340 --> 26:56.760
Yeah?

26:56.780 --> 26:59.890
I know you're not angry at me,you're angry at the system,and how it's--

26:59.910 --> 27:01.530
Yeah,you know what?You're right.
You're absolutely right.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.920
I am angry at the system,but unfortunately for you,

27:03.940 --> 27:06.290
the system doesn't happen to be here.
Would you hold my drink,please?

27:06.310 --> 27:07.550
- And--
- What did I do?

27:07.580 --> 27:08.630
What are you doing?

27:08.650 --> 27:09.830
Get off of me!

27:09.850 --> 27:10.860
Hey,hey,hey!

27:17.340 --> 27:18.160
Wait a minute,tommy!

27:18.180 --> 27:19.860
Stop this guy or I'll--

27:19.880 --> 27:20.860
do it!

27:24.170 --> 27:25.210
Son of a bitch!

27:29.270 --> 27:30.820
I can tell.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.980
Baby,do you think you're going to be able to get some of your girlfriends to come to this thing?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.160
Because you know,as it stands,all we have to offer is,like,

27:36.180 --> 27:40.440
no food,cheap booze,and possibly some really shitty music.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.760
- But it's for a good cause,right?
- Yeah,yeah.

27:42.780 --> 27:45.080
Yeah,we're just trying to help a brother out with some hospital bills.

27:45.100 --> 27:47.950
Ooh--which I'm going to need some help with if you don't stop twisting those bad boys!

27:48.560 --> 27:49.550
Ah,come on!

27:50.420 --> 27:53.090
You better be nice to me,or my girlfriends won't come to your party.

27:53.110 --> 27:55.400
No,seriously,baby,invite anybody you can.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.280
You know,especially if they're good-looking.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.270
Super hot will be preferable,but you know,hey,straight,gay--

28:00.290 --> 28:01.830
it doesn't matter as long as they're hot.

28:01.850 --> 28:03.930
What did you say?

28:03.950 --> 28:05.070
Nothing.

28:05.090 --> 28:06.980
You said "straight or gay.
" Why did you say that?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.650
- No reason.
- Why did you say that?

28:08.670 --> 28:10.170
Oh,not the boys again.

28:10.190 --> 28:11.750
Ah.
Ok,baby.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.290
It was the guys,all right?

28:13.310 --> 28:17.960
You know,they met you,and you know,they said they were picking up a slight vibe--oh.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.630
What vibe?

28:21.260 --> 28:24.540
Oh,god,i can't tell if that hurts or if it feels really good.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.060
Oh!It hurts,it hurts,it hurts.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.330
Ok,it was just a very slight,very subtle,

28:29.350 --> 28:31.710
you know,barely recognizable lesbian thing.

28:31.740 --> 28:33.870
- Uh--from me?
- Yeah.

28:33.890 --> 28:35.120
Oh,well,that's not a big deal.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.240
It's not the first time I've been called butch.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.480
Yeah.You know,plus,these guys--they've never been between the sheets with you,so--

28:41.510 --> 28:44.310
- Get down!
- They don't even understand it.

28:44.330 --> 28:46.700
You being lesbian--that's like not even remotely possible.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.770
It's not possible,is it?

28:50.790 --> 28:54.490
You know,if you want to be worried about someone's sexual identity,I'd worry about yourself.

28:54.510 --> 28:56.920
Uh--excuse me?
What?

28:56.940 --> 28:58.420
Well,you know,

28:58.440 --> 29:02.430
a big,strong man who likes to get manhandled in bed by a woman?

29:02.450 --> 29:04.830
Ok,first of all,you're not manhandling me.

29:04.860 --> 29:06.170
- What?
- No,not at all.

29:10.190 --> 29:11.380
No,no!
No,no,no.No,no,no,no.No!

29:11.400 --> 29:13.270
Ya-ha!

29:25.250 --> 29:27.560
It's ok,calm down.
Get yourself unhooked.

29:28.890 --> 29:30.900
There you go.
Helmet.

29:32.230 --> 29:33.570
Ok.
Gloves.

29:34.570 --> 29:35.850
Ok.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.490
Door.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.230
Get a load of crispy clean over here,huh?

29:40.250 --> 29:41.600
You look very handsome today,damian.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.880
You had to say "crispy clean," didn't you?

29:42.900 --> 29:44.390
Now I'm going to be thinking about doughnuts all day.

29:44.410 --> 29:45.190
Thank you.

29:45.220 --> 29:48.460
Gentlemen,second truck is going to be late,so let's stay alert.

29:48.490 --> 29:51.310
We got fires on 5 and 6 going up to the roof.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.450
Sean,mike,you guys take the top floor.

29:53.470 --> 29:55.580
Tommy,franco,give me a search on 5.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.910
Kid,you stay with lou on 4.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.530
Be advised,99's got a dead hydrant.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.210
It's time to make the doughnuts,boys.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.230
Yeah,there we go again.
It's got to be doughnuts,doesn't it?

30:04.260 --> 30:06.510
Like that's what's making you think it.

30:06.540 --> 30:07.700
Come on.

30:09.510 --> 30:14.830
Hey,lou,I'm going to take damian up to the third floor with me,all right?

30:14.860 --> 30:16.440
Yeah.
I'll take frankie.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.450
Hey,the chief just told us--

30:17.480 --> 30:19.080
I know what the chief said.
Move your ass,let's go.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.940
Come on,hurry up.
Damian,stay close.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.370
Yeah,stand by,chief.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.020
What do we got,boys?

30:25.040 --> 30:27.550
Negative.Fire on 5,lou's search was negative.

30:27.570 --> 30:29.130
It smells like a gas leak.

30:29.150 --> 30:31.620
Cock loft is fully involved.
We're losing that top floor,man.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.170
All right,we'd better dump in a second alarm,chief.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.400
Game over,lou.

30:35.420 --> 30:38.060
Let's back it out.
And we got shit pressure in these lines.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.150
You and those nukes,get out of there!

30:40.170 --> 30:42.030
Copy that.
All right,boys,let's go.Yeah.

30:43.090 --> 30:45.450
Hey,wait,guys.
I think i heard something down the hall.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.990
We checked it.
It's all clear.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.340
No,I heard it,too.

30:48.350 --> 30:49.930
- Somebody might be down there.
- You swept it,right?

30:49.950 --> 30:51.370
Yeah,it's all clear.
We checked it.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.200
Christ!
God damn it!

30:56.220 --> 30:57.980
What do you think,tom?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.010
Lou,get everybody out,now!

31:02.900 --> 31:04.740
The chief says pull out.
We got to pull out.Let's go.

31:04.760 --> 31:05.820
All right,boys,let's pull out.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.920
- Let's go.
- Oh,yeah.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.300
Come on,damian,speed it up.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.120
Hey,what--hey,hey!

31:12.140 --> 31:13.900
God damn it!

31:13.920 --> 31:15.120
Shit.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.020
All right,listen--listen.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.430
You take him out.
I'll go get dami.

31:17.450 --> 31:18.550
- All right,go.
- And hurry up,will you?

31:18.570 --> 31:19.740
I got a meatloaf in the oven.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.740
Yeah,god damn it!
It would be a meatloaf,right?

31:22.850 --> 31:24.280
Hey,assholes!

31:24.300 --> 31:26.200
Hey!

31:28.440 --> 31:29.530
Where the hell is everyone?

31:29.550 --> 31:30.870
We had another hallway to check.

31:30.890 --> 31:31.830
You told me we were all clear.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.910
I thought that we were.
I had to call an audible.

31:33.930 --> 31:35.050
Who are you,tom brady?

31:35.070 --> 31:37.390
This thing's about to go,lou.
I'm pulling the lines out.

31:41.540 --> 31:44.660
Tommy,copy!
Tommy?

31:44.680 --> 31:46.030
I got nothing.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.750
Gavin!

31:47.770 --> 31:50.940
Gavin,do you hear me?
God damn it,tommy,answer me!

31:53.900 --> 31:55.830
Get him down!

31:56.400 --> 31:58.840
Way to keep the team together,brady.

31:58.860 --> 32:00.700
You tell the boys the coach wants everyone in the kitchen

32:00.730 --> 32:03.240
as soon as we land for a good,old-fashioned ass reaming.

32:03.260 --> 32:04.760
Go!

32:19.100 --> 32:20.610
I'm at a loss here,fellas.

32:20.630 --> 32:25.010
I have tried every method I can think of to get the message across.

32:25.030 --> 32:28.790
I've tried to be a pal,play nice,and you take advantage of me.

32:28.810 --> 32:30.630
It was a miscommunication,chief.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.780
Yeah,you know,we thought we left a straggler or two behind.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.190
We got lost on the way back,that's it.

32:34.210 --> 32:37.420
I happened to remember the floor plan because I was at a fire there 15--

32:37.440 --> 32:38.230
- Shut up.
- You--

32:38.250 --> 32:39.410
Shut up!

32:39.430 --> 32:43.160
When I give the order to pull out,that is what I expect you to do.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.580
Otherwise,I'm out there in the middle of the street with my thumb up my ass

32:45.610 --> 32:46.960
and I don't know where anybody is.

32:46.980 --> 32:50.510
- I--
- What--shut your mouth,gavin!

32:50.530 --> 32:53.980
Do you have any idea of the message you are sending to this new probie?

32:54.010 --> 32:57.780
What the hell kind of example are you setting out there?

32:59.960 --> 33:02.510
You don't get it.

33:02.530 --> 33:06.240
You goddamn morons,do you know what chemistry is,huh?

33:06.260 --> 33:08.310
Chemistry is what makes this crew

33:08.340 --> 33:10.950
the best goddamn crew I've ever worked with.

33:10.970 --> 33:12.830
Now,you mess with that the way you did today,

33:12.850 --> 33:16.940
and I guarantee you--mark my words,people are going to die.

33:16.970 --> 33:19.340
I'm not blaming you.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.830
I'm blaming you.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.640
You stopped being tommy gavin today

33:23.670 --> 33:26.360
and you started playing mother hen to that kid.

33:26.380 --> 33:29.150
I promised his mother that i would keep an eye on him.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.680
That's what I was doing.

33:30.700 --> 33:32.700
You were keeping an eye on him the same way

33:32.730 --> 33:36.240
you keep an eye on every other goddamn member of this crew.No different!

33:36.260 --> 33:38.130
You got any special responsibility to that kid,

33:38.170 --> 33:41.850
it's to turn him into every inch the firefighter his old man was.

33:41.870 --> 33:44.680
'Cause I'll tell all of youse,we get another jimmy keefe on this crew,

33:44.700 --> 33:45.950
and nothing's ever going to touch it.

33:45.970 --> 33:49.100
And I'm not going to let you assholes screw that up.

33:50.360 --> 33:55.710
All right.From now on,damian is with lou.

33:55.730 --> 33:57.950
And that solves your problem.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.870
- Now,you hear me?
- Yeah.

34:00.890 --> 34:02.140
Do you hear me?

34:02.160 --> 34:03.970
- Yes,chief.
- Yes,yes.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.340
Let's hope so,assholes.

34:07.580 --> 34:09.270
Wash up.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.199
Wow.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.489
- That shit was brutal.
- Yeah,no shit.

34:17.510 --> 34:20.170
And probie's probably still in the kitchen trying to wash the blood off the walls.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.900
Yeah,well,tell me this.What were we doing listening to garrity in the first place,you know?

34:22.920 --> 34:24.630
He's the biggest retard on the crew.

34:24.659 --> 34:25.889
You know what?

34:25.909 --> 34:26.949
Strike that--second biggest.

34:26.980 --> 34:28.790
Hey,you know what?
I think the chief is right on this one.

34:28.820 --> 34:31.460
I mean,on this job and this crew,there's only one tommy gavin.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.770
And I doubt that any of us would want to be him right now.

34:35.489 --> 34:36.320
Sorry?

34:36.330 --> 34:38.800
I said I doubt any of us would want to be him right now.

34:38.820 --> 34:40.780
And by him,I mean you.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.770
- You're not even going to try to--
- Nope.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.900
Yep.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.110
- Yeah?
- Hi.

34:50.130 --> 34:53.889
Damian told me what happened today,and I need you to come over right now.

34:53.909 --> 34:57.030
- Why?
- Come over now.

34:57.060 --> 34:59.900
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Ok.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.650
"Damian is out with his friends--drink this--

35:18.660 --> 35:20.760
come into the kitchen."

35:20.780 --> 35:23.760
Who?

35:35.740 --> 35:37.900
"Drink this.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.550
Look towards the living room.

35:47.990 --> 35:51.150
Tommy is his name,firefighting is his game.

35:51.170 --> 35:53.820
And he's got sheila on his mind.
And wow!

35:53.840 --> 35:55.630
He's feelin' fine!

35:55.640 --> 35:58.140
- Go,tommy!
- Jesus.

35:59.540 --> 36:01.050
You scared the shit out of me.

36:01.900 --> 36:05.650
Well,you know,i wanted to thank you,

36:05.670 --> 36:07.390
for sticking by your word.

36:07.410 --> 36:10.140
You didn't have to thank me,I was just doing my job.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.400
Oh,no.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.370
I'm going to thank you.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.210
I'm going to thank the shit out of you.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.250
All right.

36:41.530 --> 36:42.960
Jesus christ.Oh.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.730
There you go.

37:13.050 --> 37:14.520
Oh,boy.

37:18.530 --> 37:23.440
You know,this being his first day--

37:24.450 --> 37:28.930
I tell you,it's kind of weird.It's like for the first time

37:28.950 --> 37:31.630
- in months--
- Yeah?

37:31.650 --> 37:34.460
I can actually breathe,you know?

37:35.350 --> 37:37.650
And it's all because of you.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.260
Yeah?

37:40.280 --> 37:42.410
- I'm the greatest.
- Yes,you are.

37:44.520 --> 37:49.570
Hmm,it's like knowing that whenever he goes into a fire,

37:49.590 --> 37:52.180
you're going to be right by his side.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.530
It just makes everything better.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.550
That's how it's going to be,right?

38:00.290 --> 38:01.570
Good.

38:01.590 --> 38:02.470
- Now--
- Yeah?

38:02.490 --> 38:06.630
- Get out of here.
- Ok.I can--I'm going to

38:06.650 --> 38:10.510
just--whew--how about if I make a sandwich and--

38:10.530 --> 38:12.890
Yes,make a sandwich and have a drink,and

38:12.920 --> 38:15.620
just make sure that you lock up before you go.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.450
Ok.

38:17.470 --> 38:20.020
- Good night.
- Bye.

38:21.840 --> 38:25.160
You really like bunnies.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.820
Oh,boy.

38:43.540 --> 38:46.110
- Nice going,lover boy.
- Hey.

38:46.130 --> 38:47.680
So you enjoy yourself?

38:47.690 --> 38:49.710
What do--what do you mean?

38:50.240 --> 38:53.080
Well,did christmas come a little early this year,tom?

38:53.100 --> 38:55.130
I mean,what-- You got--

38:55.160 --> 38:57.300
you got a little something in your hair there.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.380
Oh.
Yeah.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.810
Relax.
It's all good.

39:02.830 --> 39:05.010
I mean,I got no choice,right?

39:05.030 --> 39:06.100
That's the way it's gonna be.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.590
I've got to face the facts.

39:07.610 --> 39:10.390
I'm dead.

39:10.410 --> 39:11.930
I ain't never coming back.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.340
But she looks good,though.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.770
No,she-- The first time in forever she's happy.

39:15.790 --> 39:18.230
- Yeah.
- Satisfied.

39:18.250 --> 39:19.920
Sleeping through the night.

39:19.940 --> 39:23.060
Damian's as safe as any guy could be on the job,right?

39:23.080 --> 39:25.320
And by the way,the chief is right.

39:25.340 --> 39:27.450
Damian should definitely be paired up with lou.

39:27.470 --> 39:28.170
Yeah.
