WEBVTT

00:42.738 --> 00:43.782
Time to get up already?

00:43.956 --> 00:45.610
Mm, for me.
Early department meeting.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.353
You should stay in bed
a while longer.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.746
So should you.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.096
Mm.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.359
How about I put a call in
to Rosalia's,

00:55.533 --> 00:58.580
breakfast burrito,
latte for pickup.

00:58.754 --> 00:59.624
20 minutes saved.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.932
If I get back
in that bed,

01:03.106 --> 01:05.065
it's gonna be for more
than 20 minutes.

01:05.239 --> 01:05.891
Oh.

01:07.502 --> 01:08.198
I can be late.

01:13.247 --> 01:14.726
I told you
to put on a jacket.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.901
And I told you
I'd be fine.

01:17.512 --> 01:18.382
Are you fine?

01:19.731 --> 01:21.385
No. I'm freezing.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.648
It's San Jose.

01:23.822 --> 01:24.867
"Winter" is
a relative term.

01:25.041 --> 01:25.694
Eh.

01:28.131 --> 01:28.914
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.443
Weren't you wearing that
yesterday?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.445
I crashed at her place.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.099
We were working on a research
project and finished late,

01:39.273 --> 01:40.839
and he slept
on the couch.

01:41.013 --> 01:41.666
Didn't you have
a date?

01:42.754 --> 01:43.451
I rescheduled it.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.237
I gotta get inside and shower
or I'll be late for my call.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.196
See you.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.110
- All right.
- See ya.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.853
- He's bread crumbing you.
- Excuse me?

01:55.027 --> 01:57.247
He's flirtatious,
non-committal.

01:57.421 --> 02:00.381
He's giving you
just enough attention
to keep you on the hook.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.774
He's dropping crumbs.
You'll never get
the full slice.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.080
We're just friends.

02:04.254 --> 02:05.821
I'm fine with that.-

02:05.995 --> 02:08.302
Hm. Or maybe you're settling
for whatever he'll give you.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.699
When did the stomach pain
begin?

02:15.570 --> 02:17.746
A couple weeks ago.

02:17.920 --> 02:21.010
I'm on my tenth day
of Lupron, so it could be
the side effects.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.013
We're hoping
for an embryo transfer
at the end of the month.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.971
Gotta take care
of this mama.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.451
Other than the pain,
any other--

02:27.625 --> 02:28.713
Emesis, fever, sweats.

02:33.631 --> 02:34.328
Some tenderness
and distension.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.463
A scar on the right
lower quadrant.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.117
That's a first date souvenir.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.032
Unofficial first date.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.425
A McBurney's incision.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.470
You had
an open appendectomy.

02:46.644 --> 02:47.645
She had
a ruptured appendix.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.038
I'm an RN.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.475
Oh, it was
a medical meet-cute.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.391
I'm okay.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.263
You are not.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.482
There is
an irregularly shaped mass

02:58.656 --> 02:59.614
in the right-side
pelvic region.

02:59.788 --> 03:00.745
You need a CT, stat.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.756
Can I help you?

03:11.930 --> 03:13.193
Are you okay?

03:15.847 --> 03:19.416
Um, I fell
and hit my head.

03:19.590 --> 03:20.678
Come here.

03:24.465 --> 03:25.553
Possible head trauma.

03:33.778 --> 03:34.866
Can you give me your name
and date of birth?

03:35.040 --> 03:38.043
Um, Toni Rhodes,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.524
Aug-- August 7, 1995.

03:40.698 --> 03:41.656
Slowly reactive pupils.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.223
Any drugs
or alcohol use?

03:43.397 --> 03:44.354
No. No.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.270
Uh, yes.

03:47.444 --> 03:48.837
I-- I had a couple drinks
last night.

03:50.708 --> 03:51.796
How did I get here?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.283
And we need a head CT
to check for brain bleed
or skull fractures.

04:01.719 --> 04:02.807
Oh, my stomach is...

04:04.896 --> 04:05.810
How did you get this?

04:08.639 --> 04:10.206
Okay, her abdomen is rigid
and distended.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.779
Significant
intraperitoneal hemorrhage

04:17.953 --> 04:19.215
at left upper quadrant.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.347
You're bleeding
from your spleen.

04:20.521 --> 04:20.869
We need to get you
into surgery.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.714
I reviewed
your patient's ultrasound.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.672
The appearance of that
mixed-echogenic mass
is unusual.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.544
Yes.

04:43.718 --> 04:44.849
- We--
- Keep me posted.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.635
Ooh, you went to Rosalia's?

04:47.809 --> 04:50.246
The breakfast burrito
with the spicy chorizo--

04:50.420 --> 04:52.074
Try molten chorizo.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.815
Totally worth the ulcer
I'm probably getting.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.251
Hard stan.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.862
I have never been
to Rosalia's.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.909
I recommend it.

05:01.083 --> 05:01.866
Your images are ready,
Dr. Murphy.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.395
There is the mass.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.355
There's a ton of free fluid
surrounding the lesion.

05:12.529 --> 05:16.403
Possible active bleeding and
invasion into adjacent organs.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.231
She needs surgery immediately
for resection of the lesion.

05:21.799 --> 05:22.887
How long
have you had these?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.367
My monster horns?

05:24.541 --> 05:25.977
A few years.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.676
But now they're making it hard
for my glasses to stay on.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.509
I keep them hidden
with my hair.

05:35.683 --> 05:38.120
You are beautiful,
and you have nothing to hide.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.904
But those glasses do need
to stay put,

05:40.078 --> 05:41.993
so I think we should
remove these growths.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.909
Without shaving my hair
or leaving big scars?

05:45.083 --> 05:47.085
Those are the only options
other doctors have given me.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.435
Those doctors don't know
my technique.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.920
I'll make
a tiny incision here.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.446
It minimizes scars, and it'll
leave your hair intact.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.753
- Okay.
- Okay?

06:02.927 --> 06:03.928
Put Gwendolyn on my schedule
in the morning.

06:05.190 --> 06:05.756
Thank you,
Dr. Andrews.

06:05.930 --> 06:06.931
Yes.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.979
Toni's CT
came back clean.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.633
No fractures
or intracranial bleeding,

06:12.807 --> 06:14.156
so she's clear
for surgery.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.766
Hm.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.159
We need to finish our research
for tomorrow?

06:17.333 --> 06:18.247
I'll spring for pizza.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.427
Have you ever heard
of bread crumbing?

06:24.601 --> 06:25.907
Does it involve pigeons?

06:26.864 --> 06:29.127
No.

06:29.301 --> 06:32.479
It's when two people
hang out a lot.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.612
One wants to be
more than friends,

06:35.786 --> 06:37.832
and the other
isn't clear.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.836
Question is, what should
the first person do--

06:42.010 --> 06:44.186
be patient or move on?

06:45.361 --> 06:47.972
Asking for a friend.

06:48.146 --> 06:51.802
I'd say
real personal connection
can be rare, invaluable,

06:51.976 --> 06:54.979
whether the context
is romantic or platonic.

06:57.895 --> 06:58.983
I'll see you inside.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.948
There are tentacles
of scar tissue

07:07.122 --> 07:09.516
reaching into every organ.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.083
Multiple abscesses
and infection burden.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.955
We will need
several drains.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.392
100 cc already.
This infection is crazy.

07:20.135 --> 07:24.574
So, things with you and Lim
are still sorta awkward?

07:24.748 --> 07:27.185
Dr. Lim and I have
a professional relationship

07:27.359 --> 07:29.492
centered on medicine.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.234
The mass is adherent
to the pelvic wall,

07:32.408 --> 07:33.888
colon, bladder, uterus.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.979
But you guys
used to be closer.
Do you miss that?

07:38.153 --> 07:40.068
Cutting through
more tissue.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.896
Dr. Lim is
Chief of Surgery,

07:42.897 --> 07:45.073
I am an attending.

07:45.247 --> 07:48.903
A medical focus is logical
and productive.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.254
We've reached the mass.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.734
Cutting into the capsule.

07:53.908 --> 07:54.952
Wait.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.040
Oh, my God, is that...

07:58.782 --> 08:00.480
A surgical towel.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.790
Have my special
ex lap tray ready.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.705
Transfuse two units
and stay two ahead.

08:08.879 --> 08:09.619
Place a Foley catheter now.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.840
Her hematocrit's
in the toilet.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.059
A fall shouldn't have caused
this much damage.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.452
She was high
when she came in.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.367
No telling what
could've happened.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.151
How about we hold that
judgment till her tox
results come back?

08:20.325 --> 08:21.892
Placing arterial line now.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.330
Sluggish pupils, memory loss,
confusion-- she's using.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.638
Not judgment, just recognize
certain behavior when I see it.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.510
She's hemodynamically unstable.
Debate later.

08:30.684 --> 08:31.641
Right now, we need
to stop this bleed.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.819
Dr. Allen, why aren't you
placing the catheter?

08:37.691 --> 08:39.562
There's severe bruising
and signs of major trauma

08:39.736 --> 08:40.389
in her pelvic region.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.175
I think she was raped.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.617
We were able to save
your spleen,

08:50.791 --> 08:52.662
but you bled a lot
during the surgery

08:52.836 --> 08:54.403
for reasons
we don't understand yet.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.752
We need to run more tests.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.540
When we were placing
your catheter,

09:00.714 --> 09:02.324
we discovered some bruising
and signs of trauma

09:02.498 --> 09:04.848
in your pelvic region.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.415
We're worried you may have been
sexually assaulted.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.425
No, that's...
just not possible.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.646
Your urine testing also
came back positive
for Rohypnol.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.082
It's often associated
with date rape.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.562
No, I-I...

09:24.476 --> 09:26.304
I went out for drinks
with my friend.

09:26.478 --> 09:30.047
We were celebrating
his new job.

09:30.221 --> 09:33.094
I watched the bartender
mix my drinks.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.357
I was tipsy,
but I wasn't drunk.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.581
The bruises must be from
when I tripped.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.887
I would remember if
what you're saying happened.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.411
Rohypnol can cause
short-term amnesia.

09:49.327 --> 09:52.156
I'm sure this information
is a shock.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.159
We're here
to support you.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.687
The best way
to gather evidence

10:00.861 --> 10:04.821
as to what happened
is to do a rape kit.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.258
No, I-- I don't
need that.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.871
I was with my friend.

10:12.350 --> 10:14.875
He wouldn't let anything
happen to me.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.442
You don't have to decide
right now.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.401
Get some rest.

10:19.575 --> 10:20.794
We'll let you know when
your latest labs come back.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.718
A retained surgical item?

10:31.892 --> 10:34.546
It's a towel that was left
in you after a procedure.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.245
It is adherent
to several vital organs.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.726
We could not
remove it without
irreversibly damaging--

10:39.900 --> 10:42.163
Left behind by who?
My doctor?

10:42.337 --> 10:43.643
Let's focus on getting it out
first, and then we can--

10:43.817 --> 10:46.167
Who performed
my appendectomy?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.472
Broder, I think. But--

10:47.647 --> 10:49.518
The count of sponges
and other items

10:49.692 --> 10:51.955
inside the surgical cavity
is done by
the lead scrub nurse.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.043
But you may
discuss this later.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.263
Okay. So who was
the lead scrub nurse?

10:55.437 --> 10:57.134
Gomez, maybe, or Kraus.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.353
I really don't remember.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.921
But <i>you</i> were
definitely there.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.879
Are you blaming this
on me?

11:03.053 --> 11:04.881
You were one of the nurses.
I mean, shouldn't you
have noticed?

11:05.055 --> 11:07.057
I was circulating,
not scrub.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.537
No way I was the one
who did this.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.147
A minute ago
you can't remember,

11:10.321 --> 11:12.062
but now you're sure
you didn't do it.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.586
- Maybe we should
move on to--
- Why are you attacking me?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.980
I just found out I have
an infected towel in my gut

11:17.154 --> 11:19.069
that will require
major surgery,

11:19.243 --> 11:20.984
and you're making this
about you.

11:21.158 --> 11:21.942
You're acting like
this was my fault.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.291
It doesn't matter
whose fault it was.

11:27.599 --> 11:31.342
We will approach the towel
like a sarcoma--

11:31.516 --> 11:32.953
perform
an en bloc resection,

11:33.127 --> 11:35.695
bypass any intertwined
vital arterial structures,

11:35.869 --> 11:38.393
and finish with
a thorough debridement.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.308
I think that's
a reasonable option.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.136
Well, right now, your opinion
doesn't mean a lot.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.835
I just need a minute.

11:48.969 --> 11:49.752
I'll be out
in the hall.

11:53.669 --> 11:56.367
She's... not conscious.

11:57.629 --> 11:58.761
She's syncopal.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.502
She fainted?-

12:00.676 --> 12:01.764
- Naveen.
- BP spiking.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.940
- Oh, my God.
- Heart rate's up.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.986
Possible bleed
or septic shock.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.901
Crash airway tray!

12:08.075 --> 12:10.468
An additional abscess cavity
in the towel may have ruptured.

12:10.642 --> 12:11.687
We need to get her
back to the O.R.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.475
You wanted to see me?-Hey.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.695
Yeah, I'm double booked tomorrow.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.437
You'll be scrubbing in
with Dr. Annanian
for Gwendolyn's surgery.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.048
But she was so impressed
with you.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.137
She's really excited
to have you as her surgeon.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.009
Well, it's a meeting
I can't miss.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.272
But Dr. Annanian has
my surgical plan.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.186
I'll check in afterwards.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.844
The rupture caused
widespread peritonitis.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.324
This infection is way worse
than before.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.326
Aggressively irrigate,
debride, and suction.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.114
We need to control
the infection.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.072
Send tissue and fluid
to the micro lab

12:49.246 --> 12:51.074
so we can focus
her antibiotics.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.208
Big drop in BP.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.775
Heart rate spiking.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.037
She isn't tolerating surgery.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.430
We need to close her
again. Sutures.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.392
Wait,
what about the towel?

13:04.566 --> 13:07.961
We can't operate until her BP
and O2 sats are under control.

13:08.135 --> 13:12.226
She'll need to remain sedated
and intubated
until she stabilizes.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.359
And we need to find a new
approach to removing the towel.

13:15.533 --> 13:16.360
Once she's closed,
I can dive into research.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.756
I will consult
with Dr. Lim.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.021
I would like
a surgical consult.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.458
The Mukherjee case?

13:27.632 --> 13:30.679
The mass on the CT was
a retained surgical towel.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.464
And is acutely infected
and adherent to vital organs.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.163
The patient blames her wife,
who was a surgical nurse

13:36.337 --> 13:38.078
during the appendectomy--
circulating, not scrub.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.340
If we could stick
to the medical--

13:39.514 --> 13:41.211
The patient
didn't understand

13:41.385 --> 13:42.604
the count was not
her wife's responsibility.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.649
They argued quite a--

13:44.824 --> 13:47.696
The most pressing issue
is the towel
poisoning her from the inside.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.525
What is your plan
to remove it?

13:50.699 --> 13:51.395
That...

13:53.267 --> 13:55.399
is what I am here
to discuss.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.882
You are an attending,
Dr. Murphy.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.362
And your patient
has a few hours

14:01.536 --> 14:04.495
before she's stable enough
for any procedure.

14:04.669 --> 14:08.238
Research RSIs and
brainstorm possible
solutions with your team.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.284
Then, if you still need
a consult, my door is open.

14:20.337 --> 14:21.164
How's
Toni's platelet count?

14:21.338 --> 14:22.731
Still dropping.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.124
Did you do
an anti-platelet antibody?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.169
Waiting on results.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.128
Order another PRBC transfusion
to get her hematocrit up.

14:29.738 --> 14:30.957
Any progress
on the rape kit?

14:34.090 --> 14:35.004
She doesn't want
to talk about it.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.225
I can't blame her.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.705
It's an invasive process
that only serves to prove

14:40.880 --> 14:43.491
something horrible happened
that she doesn't remember.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.407
Her brain may not be able
to remember, but her body does.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.149
And chances are, eventually,
it will all come back.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.238
Shouldn't we respect
her wishes?

14:51.412 --> 14:52.152
I mean, we don't want her
to feel like

14:52.326 --> 14:54.023
she's being assaulted
all over again.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.286
Denying what happened
doesn't change the fact
that it happened.

14:58.636 --> 14:59.724
It's Toni-- Code Gray.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.992
No, please, please, stop!

15:06.166 --> 15:07.994
She woke up screaming,
and she pulled out her IV.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.734
Just stay away from me!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.606
We just want to help you.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.347
Toni, you're okay.

15:14.522 --> 15:15.349
We're here with you.

15:16.176 --> 15:18.134
It's not real.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.962
Can you breathe with me?

15:26.142 --> 15:27.143
You're okay.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.713
You're not in danger anymore.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.325
I...

15:36.326 --> 15:37.501
had a nightmare.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.114
Her gown.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.379
I need to take a look
at that.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.076
Okay?

15:56.607 --> 15:57.521
The spleen repair
didn't work.

16:03.832 --> 16:07.444
[Shaun] Over the course
of your long career,

16:07.618 --> 16:09.359
you have removed
five retained sponges.

16:09.533 --> 16:12.101
That is statistically higher
than any surgeon in the region.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.017
Special skill on my resume
right under juggling.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.888
My patient has
a retained towel

16:17.063 --> 16:19.195
that has caused sepsis
with multi-organ involvement.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.371
I would like
a surgical consult.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.112
Perfect request
for your department head.

16:23.286 --> 16:26.637
Dr. Lim said I should tackle
the problem on my own.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.466
Well, that's interesting.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.208
She is right.
I am an attending.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.432
But your RSI experience
would be
very helpful on this case.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.217
All right,
I'll take a look.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.442
Thank you.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.139
Nurse Villanueva,

16:50.313 --> 16:53.142
why is Gwen's surgery
still on my schedule?

16:53.316 --> 16:55.231
She panicked when I told her
it'd be another surgeon.

16:55.405 --> 16:56.363
- She really wants you.
- Assure the patient

16:56.537 --> 16:58.017
she's in great hands
with Dr. Annanian,

16:58.191 --> 16:59.540
and take her
off my rotation.

16:59.714 --> 17:00.410
No.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.893
You told her
you'd do the surgery.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.460
You can tell her that
you're not going to do it.

17:10.464 --> 17:14.207
What about a minimally
invasive surgery--

17:14.381 --> 17:16.078
cutting up the towel,
removing it piece by piece
through a single port?

17:16.252 --> 17:17.601
That won't work.

17:17.775 --> 17:18.950
Where it's stitched
to the organs,

17:19.125 --> 17:20.952
the infected tissue
puts her at high risk.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.130
An aggressive gross total
resection of all organs invaded

17:24.304 --> 17:26.349
by the towel plus all infected
and necrotic tissue

17:26.523 --> 17:28.308
is the best option
for long-term survival.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.440
That procedure
risks major bleeds,

17:30.614 --> 17:33.182
and we'd have to remove
her uterus.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.706
They're planning a family,
and Naveen is supposed
to carry the baby.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.622
That will also be impossible
if she is dead.

17:39.754 --> 17:40.624
That's elegantly put.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.324
The wife of the patient
is here, right?

17:45.542 --> 17:47.153
Explain the options
to her,

17:47.327 --> 17:49.590
and see how she wants us
to proceed.

17:49.764 --> 17:53.768
They had an argument
before her last surgery.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.553
She will not be pleased with
her wife making that decision.

17:56.727 --> 17:57.902
Just go talk to her.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.477
We figured out
why you've been bleeding.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.393
You have a condition
known as ITP.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.656
Your immune system
is destroying your platelets.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.094
Can you fix it?

18:15.268 --> 18:16.356
There is medication
that can help.

18:17.922 --> 18:20.490
And we need to remove
your spleen.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.840
Why didn't you just do that
during my earlier surgery?

18:23.014 --> 18:24.973
We weren't aware
of your ITP.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.801
It's a condition that
can be triggered by trauma.

18:26.975 --> 18:30.413
The ITP complicates
our approach.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.850
Usually, we'd
remove your spleen
through your abdomen,

18:33.024 --> 18:37.159
but that risks
a catastrophic bleed.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.988
We can remove
your spleen vaginally
with minimal incisions.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.163
There's less risk
of bleeding.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.429
Okay, let's do it.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.518
I'm hoping you'll let us do
a rape kit
before the procedure.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.435
I already told you, no.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.439
The transvaginal approach
will destroy

18:56.613 --> 18:57.571
all evidence
of the sexual assault.

18:57.745 --> 18:58.441
No.

19:00.095 --> 19:01.357
I don't care.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.707
Without the kit,
you'll have no proof.

19:08.886 --> 19:09.931
You're right.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.197
I believe that something
terrible happened to me.

19:17.895 --> 19:21.072
But that is true whether or not
I go chase down the boogeyman.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.509
But it could help.

19:22.683 --> 19:23.336
Nothing will help.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.253
Don't let whoever did this
to you get away with it.

19:28.167 --> 19:28.950
He already has.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.434
Doing a rape kit
is not going to unrape me.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.573
Go ahead
with the surgery.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.190
We need your decision.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.152
Is there any way to do
the total resection

19:57.326 --> 19:58.762
without removing
Naveen's uterus?

20:00.024 --> 20:01.591
No.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.290
She's dreamed of being pregnant
her whole life.

20:04.464 --> 20:05.247
I can't choose this
for her.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.770
You can.

20:08.381 --> 20:11.166
We understand
how difficult this is.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.168
- She'll never forgive me.
- She will.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.170
I mean, it's obvious
Naveen loves you.

20:15.344 --> 20:18.391
She already blames me
for what's happening.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.871
If I'm the one that takes away
her chance to carry a child...

20:24.614 --> 20:26.747
You are right.

20:26.921 --> 20:27.965
If you choose
the gross resection

20:28.139 --> 20:29.619
and your wife
loses her uterus,

20:29.793 --> 20:31.752
it is likely
she will never forgive you.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.014
But that is irrelevant.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.102
This is your decision.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.801
You have to make it.

20:40.369 --> 20:41.588
Whatever happens next.

20:47.637 --> 20:48.682
Do the total resection.

21:04.524 --> 21:07.222
I haven't seen you around here
for a while, huh?

21:07.396 --> 21:10.138
Forgot how
relationships can eat
into discretionary time.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.835
Doesn't exactly sound
like a complaint.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.230
It's not.

21:15.404 --> 21:18.146
Shaun came to me
with a surgical consult.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.149
Your RSI record. Smart.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.543
He did it because
you sent him away.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.676
Well,
part of the Chief's job

21:26.850 --> 21:30.114
is to empower their attendings
to find their own solutions.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.507
Sounds like Shaun did.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.379
A lot of ways to empower
an attending.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.685
And I chose one.

21:35.859 --> 21:36.730
Because you're still angry
with Shaun?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.386
- Okay.
- How long are you
gonna keep that up?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.170
How about
as long as I want?

21:42.344 --> 21:45.434
Okay, you be as mad at Shaun
for as long as you need to be.

21:45.608 --> 21:46.914
Thanks
for the permission.

21:47.088 --> 21:48.829
Just so you know,
it's toxic.

21:49.003 --> 21:50.134
And not just for Shaun.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.832
Spare me.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.573
You're not concerned for anyone
other than Shaun.

21:57.011 --> 21:57.881
I have to
get back to work.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.110
Dr. Andrews.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.510
I rescheduled
my finance meeting.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.250
But in the future,

22:19.425 --> 22:21.644
I'm requesting a scrub nurse
who respects my role

22:21.818 --> 22:24.343
as surgeon
and hospital president.

22:35.179 --> 22:39.140
When I was in the hospital,
you sat at my bedside.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.229
You helped me recover
when I wasn't sure I wanted to.

22:42.752 --> 22:43.405
That meant a lot.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.715
Personal attention
with patients is important
even when you're president.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.467
The laparoscopic splenectomy

23:01.641 --> 23:03.686
is a great alternative
to the transvaginal--

23:03.860 --> 23:06.994
Toni's surgery is already
scheduled for this evening.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.692
And she asked that you be
removed from her case.

23:09.866 --> 23:12.260
She may regret
not taking action on this
for the rest of her life.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.743
That's her decision,
not yours.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.358
I got your message, Shaun.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.881
What's so urgent?

23:25.055 --> 23:26.970
I have added you
to Naveen's surgical team.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.538
Please get ready to scrub in
in 30 minutes.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.280
You have a surgical plan
in place, Shaun.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.891
You're perfectly capable of
executing that plan.

23:35.065 --> 23:38.808
It is my responsibility
as attending to create

23:38.982 --> 23:41.420
the conditions most likely to
result in a positive outcome.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.422
Which you've done.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.425
Which include the presence of
a surgeon with RSI experience.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.992
Shaun, you're-- you've always
been confident
in-- in the O.R.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.996
What is this about?

23:53.170 --> 23:55.434
Having a surgeon with
relevant experience present

23:55.608 --> 23:56.696
in case I need advice.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.047
- Well, what if I'm busy?
- You're not.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.744
What exactly about this case
is so concerning--

24:01.918 --> 24:04.443
You have more
RSI experience

24:04.617 --> 24:06.488
than any surgeon
in this hospital.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.011
That is why I would like you
in this surgery.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.146
Please?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.800
All right, fine.
I'll be there.

24:13.974 --> 24:14.844
Please get changed.

24:22.243 --> 24:25.028
I can't reach the highest point
from here.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.421
Best way to hide the scars
is to go in
above her hair line.

24:30.860 --> 24:31.861
We'll need to shave
some of her hair.

24:34.647 --> 24:35.517
Maybe not.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.564
Someone get me a comb.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.743
Moving on
to the hysterectomy.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.049
Please clamp
the uterine horns.

24:52.055 --> 24:56.669
Grasping round ligament,
midway to the inter--
internal inguinal...

24:58.975 --> 25:00.194
Infection
of the muscular layer

25:00.368 --> 25:01.630
of the uterine wall
has reduced.

25:03.414 --> 25:06.069
Maybe we can
save her uterus.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.392
Shaun?

25:26.960 --> 25:28.352
Come on.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.179
Shaun.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.096
Stick to the plan.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.230
You cannot save
the uterus.

25:39.799 --> 25:40.582
Okay.

25:43.672 --> 25:44.586
You are right.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.414
Necrosis
is too advanced.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.811
Transfixion sutures
and hemoclip.

26:06.303 --> 26:07.130
Hey.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.874
I wanted to see
how you're doing.

26:13.006 --> 26:15.138
Naveen is
recovering well.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.142
The surgery turned out
as expected.

26:19.316 --> 26:22.145
You hesitated
in the O.R.
What was that about?

26:22.319 --> 26:25.975
I wanted to save
her uterus.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.630
Why'd you get stuck on
not doing the hysterectomy?

26:28.804 --> 26:30.632
The patient wants
to carry a child.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.156
Well,
that's very empathetic.

26:33.330 --> 26:34.941
I guess you-- you developed
a personal connection?

26:39.075 --> 26:41.643
Luna made
the right decision

26:43.645 --> 26:46.953
even if her wife
will never forgive her.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.912
Are you worried that
this will hurt their marriage?

26:50.086 --> 26:52.088
It doesn't matter, okay?
It doesn't matter.

26:52.262 --> 26:56.005
What matters is that
she is alive.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.659
We saved her life.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.662
Well, that is one thing
that matters.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.577
So is losing
a personal connection--

27:02.751 --> 27:03.839
No, the medicine is--

27:04.013 --> 27:05.188
Shaun,
is this about Lim?

27:06.537 --> 27:07.669
What-- What about her?

27:09.018 --> 27:11.020
I don't know.
I just-- It's...

27:11.194 --> 27:12.500
Lim is still
up-- upset with you.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.937
She's still mad at you.
D-Does that bother you?

27:15.111 --> 27:16.809
Dr. Lim and I have
a professional relationship--

27:16.983 --> 27:17.940
No. No, you don't.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.508
And you need
to fix that.

27:20.682 --> 27:21.770
The two of you need
to sort that out.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.554
I don't know what
you want me to do.

27:23.729 --> 27:24.730
I want you and Lim
to talk to each other.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.470
She does not want to talk
to me.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.950
That depends on what
you have to say.

27:28.124 --> 27:30.344
I have nothing to say.

27:30.518 --> 27:33.434
Shaun, Lim is hurting, okay?

27:34.870 --> 27:36.219
You are hurting.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.570
Tell her that.

27:39.745 --> 27:40.876
I mean, maybe--
maybe she'll forgive you.

27:41.050 --> 27:41.703
Maybe--
Maybe she won't.

27:41.877 --> 27:42.835
I don't know.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.926
But the two of you
have to resolve this

27:47.100 --> 27:48.841
for both of your sakes
and mine.

27:57.153 --> 28:00.417
Dr. Lim and I have
a professional relationship.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.158
I do not need
to talk to her.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.246
I have to finish
my op note now.

28:13.822 --> 28:16.999
I've never done a splenectomy
that way either.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.654
Cool surgery,
not the coolest circumstances.

28:23.963 --> 28:25.486
Our patient went through
something terrible

28:25.660 --> 28:27.053
and my initial reaction
was to judge her...

28:28.141 --> 28:30.534
same way people judge me.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.580
Don't beat yourself up.
You didn't know.

28:35.888 --> 28:36.715
You're a good friend.

28:37.933 --> 28:38.934
I know.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.505
But...

28:45.985 --> 28:48.770
I've been waiting
to be more than that,

28:50.554 --> 28:51.860
and I don't think
I should do that anymore.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.430
I'm gonna take a rain check
on research

28:56.604 --> 28:57.605
and reschedule my date.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.304
I think that's good.

29:03.306 --> 29:04.177
You deserve
to be happy.

29:11.619 --> 29:12.620
I have to go prep Toni.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.896
I owe you an apology
for pressuring you.

29:33.989 --> 29:34.773
I didn't do a rape kit.

29:38.298 --> 29:39.821
And I've always
regretted it.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.347
And I didn't want you
to feel the same.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.190
I was in medical school.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.977
He was a friend
of a friend.

30:07.066 --> 30:09.416
Somewhere along the way,
he became a stalker.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.811
One night he showed up
at a bar I was at.

30:15.030 --> 30:15.814
He followed me home.

30:18.642 --> 30:20.383
I hated the idea of being seen
as a victim...

30:23.647 --> 30:24.910
...so I never told anyone.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.056
I let that creep go.

30:43.798 --> 30:47.410
And now I'll never know
how many other women he hurt.

30:50.718 --> 30:51.675
But that's my regret.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.418
And it's not fair
to put that on you.

31:32.542 --> 31:33.804
I knew he liked me.

31:37.765 --> 31:40.420
I should have
made sure

31:40.594 --> 31:42.335
that he knew
it wasn't a date.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.469
I shouldn't have had
a drink. I...

31:50.604 --> 31:52.911
I don't even know

31:53.085 --> 31:54.956
if I told him to stop.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.356
What if I didn't?

32:03.530 --> 32:05.967
It is not your fault.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.188
He took away
your choice.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.277
And now you have to do
what's best for you,

32:14.802 --> 32:15.934
whatever that is.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.112
Toni, time for surgery.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.075
Not yet.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.735
There's still
a little swelling,

32:34.909 --> 32:36.128
but you'll have
minimal scarring.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.832
They're gone.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.312
Now those glasses
will stay put.

32:47.922 --> 32:49.010
Nice job with my braids.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.099
Wasn't me.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.103
Always wanted a daughter,
so I learned to braid.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.194
Well, you might've found
a nice side hustle.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.201
Thank you, Dr. Andrews.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.335
You're welcome.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.392
Are you okay
to continue?

33:24.089 --> 33:25.220
Yes.

33:36.666 --> 33:37.580
Are you okay
to continue?

33:41.367 --> 33:42.020
Yes.

33:52.465 --> 33:53.553
Are you okay to continue?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.601
Are you okay to continue?

34:04.825 --> 34:05.913
Are you okay to continue?

34:10.961 --> 34:12.963
Are you okay to continue?

34:15.792 --> 34:18.186
Naveen, in the process
of removing the towel,

34:18.360 --> 34:20.101
we also had to take
your uterus.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.584
We're so sorry.

34:24.758 --> 34:25.889
There was no other way?

34:30.459 --> 34:31.504
Yes, but I told them...

34:33.201 --> 34:33.897
I told them to do it.

34:35.725 --> 34:36.639
I needed you to survive.

34:38.554 --> 34:39.468
Because you mean everything
to me.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.776
And I failed at
my most important job--

34:42.950 --> 34:44.952
keeping you safe.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.476
I failed you five years ago
in the O.R.

34:47.650 --> 34:48.434
and again yesterday.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.481
I was so focused
on defending myself,

34:52.655 --> 34:54.614
I wasn't thinking about
what you were going through,

34:54.788 --> 34:57.356
how scared you were.
And I'm so, so sorry.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.140
Whatever you need,
if-- if you want me here

34:59.314 --> 35:00.533
every step of the way, or...

35:02.012 --> 35:03.144
out of the picture completely...

35:07.627 --> 35:09.194
You better be here
every step of the way...

35:12.153 --> 35:14.286
...because I love you
more than anything, too.

35:21.249 --> 35:22.468
I'm sorry.

35:34.610 --> 35:35.568
How's she doing?

35:36.830 --> 35:39.180
Surgery went well.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.095
- Her platelet count is turning
in the right direction.
- Good.

35:42.618 --> 35:43.489
And beyond the physical?

35:44.316 --> 35:45.230
Too early to tell.

35:46.622 --> 35:47.580
Recovery's a process.

35:50.713 --> 35:51.758
All that time
we were together,

35:54.195 --> 35:54.717
why didn't you tell me?

35:59.722 --> 36:01.594
Because I don't need
anyone's pity,

36:01.768 --> 36:02.551
yours included.

36:05.424 --> 36:06.381
It's in the past.

36:10.603 --> 36:14.128
What you did for Toni,
that was really brave.

36:17.610 --> 36:21.004
I'm here if you ever need
someone to be brave for you.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.095
Thank you.

36:37.847 --> 36:43.244
I need to talk to you
about your surgery.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.942
I can't change
what happened,

36:46.116 --> 36:48.249
and I do not owe you
an apology.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.424
Dr. Murphy.

36:49.598 --> 36:53.646
But I am sorry
for other things.

36:56.170 --> 37:00.783
In my RSI surgery today,
the medical choice was clear,

37:00.957 --> 37:02.872
but I did not
want to proceed

37:03.046 --> 37:05.135
because I knew what
the consequences would be.

37:07.268 --> 37:09.444
In your surgery,
the medical choice was clear,

37:09.618 --> 37:11.794
and I did proceed,

37:13.666 --> 37:18.453
but I did not know
what the consequences would be.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.152
I saved your life,

37:22.327 --> 37:26.809
but my decision
also caused you harm.

37:28.507 --> 37:31.814
When I saw you hurt
and bleeding...

37:34.730 --> 37:37.820
I saw my brother Steve,
when he died.

37:39.431 --> 37:40.997
When I thought
I might lose you

37:41.171 --> 37:43.826
the way I lost him,
I did not like that.

37:50.703 --> 37:51.834
I am sorry...

37:53.880 --> 37:54.620
this...

37:56.535 --> 37:58.885
has been very hard
for you.

38:01.409 --> 38:05.718
A medicine-only relationship
is-- is not easy.

38:05.892 --> 38:06.675
I...

38:08.938 --> 38:09.852
It is not what I want.

38:12.681 --> 38:14.596
I have missed
your friendship.

38:20.080 --> 38:20.863
I have missed you.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.869
This has been...

38:30.699 --> 38:31.874
really hard.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.663
And my life is in
a good place now.

38:40.274 --> 38:41.406
I'm happy.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.194
But

38:47.368 --> 38:48.674
still angry sometimes.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.766
It may take a while
to let that go.

38:57.944 --> 38:58.901
But...

39:03.079 --> 39:03.993
I've missed you,
too, Shaun.

39:10.913 --> 39:11.914
Hey.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.877
You know,
I love being the boss,
but connecting with patients

39:18.051 --> 39:20.183
is the reason I got into
medicine in the first place.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.446
And you made me
remember that.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.187
Thank you.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.450
You're welcome.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.587
Could I buy you a drink

39:32.761 --> 39:35.634
as an apology
for being a pompous ass?

39:35.808 --> 39:36.939
No.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.466
Unless you throw in
some wings and fries.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.382
Tough negotiator.

39:44.556 --> 39:45.513
You know it.

39:51.867 --> 39:52.781
Shaun came to see me.

39:54.174 --> 39:54.957
We talked.

39:56.611 --> 39:57.699
Thank you.

39:57.873 --> 39:58.961
You're welcome.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.182
Join me?

40:02.356 --> 40:04.402
I'm sure we can find
some cucumber water

40:04.576 --> 40:06.316
around here somewhere.

40:06.491 --> 40:07.622
Late dinner with Clay.

40:10.799 --> 40:11.409
Good night.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.247
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.648
Good night.

40:51.884 --> 40:52.450
What was that?

40:55.453 --> 40:56.236
I don't know.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.119
- You're back.
- Yes.

41:10.293 --> 41:13.471
You told me I was isolating
myself in my other office.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.777
Shaun, there's something
you should know.

41:15.951 --> 41:19.389
Lim, when she was in her chair
and adjusted her position,

41:19.564 --> 41:22.436
there was flexion and rotation
in the psoas and in the glutes.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.350
There was movement.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.311
She could walk again.
