00:07.833 --> 00:10.010
<i>My whole life I never knew
who I really was,</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.924
where I came from, my parents.

00:11.924 --> 00:14.666
<i>Silas told me
that they're still alive.</i>

00:14.666 --> 00:15.798
They are.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.321
The three of us and Silas,

00:17.321 --> 00:20.324
we're part of the team
that created Lazarus.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.152
<i>There is a room in that
building with a portal.</i>

00:22.152 --> 00:24.589
It can connect to the future.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.897
You're mother,
she's in 1988.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.509
Josh and Riley,
they went through to 1988.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.729
<i>Your only chance
to save your children</i>

00:33.729 --> 00:35.600
is that glass building.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.081
There are dangers there
you will not be prepared for.

00:40.823 --> 00:44.044
<i>My life is nothing
without you.</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:45.175
I'm gonna bring our son back.

00:45.175 --> 00:46.959
<i>I can finally get some answers</i>

00:46.959 --> 00:48.526
<i>about my parents.</i>

00:49.919 --> 00:51.138
Look.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.140
Okay, here we go.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.681
Once we get inside,
head to the top floor

01:12.681 --> 01:14.813
and use the keycard
to access the portal room.

01:14.813 --> 01:18.426
Then we make our way to '88,
find Riley and Josh.

01:21.211 --> 01:22.734
Put your mask up.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.127
Yep.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.179
You.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.399
Get down and get over here.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.238
All right, here we go.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.459
Take off your mask.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.423
It's getting hot anyway.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.209
I don't recognize you.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.862
Yeah, I don't recognize you.

02:05.473 --> 02:08.911
But it's--it's
my first delivery, so--

02:13.220 --> 02:14.917
Where's the usual guy?

02:17.006 --> 02:19.748
Taamet killed him.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.141
You know, he--

02:21.141 --> 02:23.317
he'll kill me too
if I don't get back soon.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.797
So if you don't mind,
we'd like to keep moving.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.973
He doesn't look
like he's buying it.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.279
What do we do?

02:29.279 --> 02:32.108
Nothing, unless we have to.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.245
Okay, new guy.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.511
Take the wagon in.
- Okay.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.646
We got a problem.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.261
Everything looks fine to me, Kiera.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.700
Nothing's fine
when Silas is around.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.702
I want everyone
on that wagon

03:00.702 --> 03:02.530
brought to me now.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.184
Security...

03:10.799 --> 03:14.324
Take him!

03:14.324 --> 03:16.021
Off the wagon now.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.372
Everybody off.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.243
Gavin!

03:20.243 --> 03:22.289
Over here.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.333
All of you.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.639
Get off there.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.424
Get down on the ground.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.643
On the floor.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.080
Hold on, we're outnumbered.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.777
Get off of me!

03:32.777 --> 03:34.214
Stay down.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.390
Ahh!

03:41.090 --> 03:42.309
You two, get him.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.922
Go, go, go.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.326
Aaah!

03:59.326 --> 04:01.371
Lucas!
No! Lucas!

04:01.371 --> 04:02.285
Are you all right?

04:03.939 --> 04:06.768
We gotta go. Aah!

04:06.768 --> 04:08.683
Izzy, Eve, run!

04:08.683 --> 04:10.032
Run!

04:12.121 --> 04:13.775
Go, go!

04:13.775 --> 04:15.559
Come on, let's go!

04:16.778 --> 04:18.649
Gavin!

04:18.649 --> 04:19.824
Dad!

04:31.183 --> 04:32.184
All right, everyone,
gather together.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.755
Move, move, move.

04:37.755 --> 04:40.715
Get in deep up that ridge.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.543
We're good.

04:42.543 --> 04:43.848
What's gonna happen to Dad?

04:43.848 --> 04:44.980
I don't know.

04:44.980 --> 04:45.894
But I should have done something.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.374
I should have helped him.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.767
If you had, then we'd be
trying to get you back too.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.813
We'll get Gavin.
- How?

04:51.813 --> 04:52.727
I don't know,
but I'm not giving up

04:52.727 --> 04:53.902
on getting to Riley.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.077
There's gotta be
another way in.

04:55.077 --> 04:56.121
Silas helped design
that building.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.515
So if anyone can help us,
it's him.

04:58.515 --> 05:01.344
Look. Silas fled this way.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.433
Could be his.
We could track him down.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.087
Yeah, but what
about Scott and Lucas?

05:05.087 --> 05:06.871
We can't just leave them
out here.

05:06.871 --> 05:09.396
Hate to say it,

05:09.396 --> 05:11.223
we don't have time
to find them.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.921
The longer we wait,
the further Silas gets.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.184
We don't have another choice.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.229
Come on, let's go.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.144
Hey, hey, hey.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.365
I'm here.
You're not alone.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.293
I don't see
the rest of our group anywhere.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.034
Okay.
Doesn't change the plan, man.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.166
We're still going
in that building. Yeah?

05:41.166 --> 05:42.385
Aah!

05:43.517 --> 05:44.779
Here, let me see.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.476
Come on.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.651
Come on!

05:48.043 --> 05:50.437
- Ahh.
- Okay.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.048
Oh, no.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.963
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.443
Oh, calm down, dude.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.227
Calm?
How can you be calm right now?

05:58.227 --> 06:00.055
These are the exact same burns
that were on Eddie.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.407
I don't need to remind you
what happened to him.

06:04.407 --> 06:08.411
Yeah, well...
I'm fine.

06:08.411 --> 06:11.283
No, you're not.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.154
We can't do this.
I've gotta take you back.

06:12.154 --> 06:13.416
No, no, no, no, no.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.939
Scott, there's nothing
for me there.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.201
I don't think that's true.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.508
What's true is
I made a promise to my mom.

06:19.857 --> 06:20.989
I want to do more with my life, man.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.294
I can't do that down here.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.775
You can barely move
right now, okay?

06:24.775 --> 06:27.082
You know I'm right.

06:27.082 --> 06:30.781
Fine. Fine.
I will go to the clearing.

06:30.781 --> 06:31.739
But you're going
to that building.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.131
No, no, no. Hey, look.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.829
You are not gonna make--
- No. I don't care, Scott.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.483
You have to try
to get out of here, man.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.007
It's your only shot.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.443
Now, don't be an idiot.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.665
I appreciate
you looking out for me.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.497
But I'd rather be
an idiot.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.504
Sorry, I don't do
a lot of cooking.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.810
Anything we don't have
to catch, we love.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.684
Caroline, you said
you had a way

07:03.684 --> 07:05.294
to stop the tidal wave.

07:05.294 --> 07:06.904
How?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.256
Let me show you.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.140
Like I said, I came to '88

07:25.140 --> 07:28.056
to access the first experiments
in time travel.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.492
I'm using that code
to create a virus

07:29.492 --> 07:31.494
that'll shut
the Lazarus program down.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.976
We created a portal
inside a building

07:34.976 --> 07:37.065
in 10,000 B.C.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.632
And as long
as that portal remains open,

07:38.632 --> 07:40.547
these sinkholes will continue
to randomly generate,

07:40.547 --> 07:42.505
increasing in size
and frequency

07:42.505 --> 07:44.551
until...

07:44.551 --> 07:47.423
We don't want to talk
about where that puts us.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.947
As long as I can stay hidden
from the people hunting me,

07:49.947 --> 07:51.253
I've got a shot.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.516
Hunting you?
Who'd want to stop you?

07:53.516 --> 07:55.257
Aren't you, like, doing
a good thing?

07:56.258 --> 07:58.260
That depends who you ask.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.920
No. It's the power.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.662
- Where's your fuse box?
- Down the road.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.447
I've been siphoning electricity
from the ice rink.

08:11.447 --> 08:14.798
They're closed for renovations,
so no one's noticed.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.844
How can we help?

08:16.844 --> 08:18.149
Replace the fuses
at the rink.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.021
Go. Now.
- Okay.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.588
Let's do it.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.855
These footprints match
the others.

08:27.855 --> 08:29.117
We're on the right track.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.640
Let's keep moving.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.343
Hey Levi, can I--
can I talk to you?

08:38.343 --> 08:39.606
Sure.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.391
We need you to help
get my dad back.

08:42.391 --> 08:45.481
But I also think, once we do,

08:45.481 --> 08:48.876
they need space
to figure things out.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.836
Didn't you see the look
in my mom's eyes

08:52.836 --> 08:54.969
when my dad was taken?

08:54.969 --> 08:57.232
I saw her fear.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.626
Well, what I saw was
that she still loves him.

09:01.758 --> 09:05.022
Turn around...

09:05.545 --> 09:07.938
and go back to your clearing.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.679
We can't do that.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.028
We have to get to Gavin.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.118
You can help us.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.294
I've been trying to help you.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.340
You may not believe me,
but everything I've done

09:18.340 --> 09:20.690
has been to protect
your husband.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.822
I was trying to make sure

09:21.822 --> 09:24.433
he didn't go back
into that building.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.174
What do you mean "back"?

09:26.174 --> 09:27.567
He's been there before?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.047
What matters is,

09:30.047 --> 09:32.876
I've gotta get him
out of there.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.009
I have a better chance
if I do it on my own.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.532
Now, leave.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.534
What are you gonna do,
kill us?

09:38.534 --> 09:39.883
My husband is in that building.

09:39.883 --> 09:43.017
I don't care what I have to do,
I'm not stopping.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.672
I know
how much Gavin cares for you.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.979
So I don't want to be
the reason you get hurt.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.808
You go in there...

09:51.808 --> 09:53.767
you might never get back out.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.682
We don't want out.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.249
There's a portal in there
that'll take us to 1988.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.731
If you care about Gavin,

10:01.731 --> 10:04.691
you'll help him get back
to his family.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.262
I have a plan.

10:11.262 --> 10:15.353
Stay close
and don't get in my way.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.573
Hey, Silas...

10:17.573 --> 10:19.662
I know we're walking
into danger,

10:19.662 --> 10:22.099
but what puts you so on edge
about this building?

10:24.580 --> 10:28.236
It's not the building.
It's the man who runs it.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.708
Where's my family?

11:05.708 --> 11:09.625
They evaded my guards.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.410
So I can only assume
they're safe.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.500
The question is...

11:17.154 --> 11:22.333
Gavin Harris...
why are you here?

11:27.817 --> 11:29.863
You don't have to be
afraid of me.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.700
Well, you know who I am,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.702
so why don't you tell me
who you are?

11:44.138 --> 11:47.271
I oversee everything
that happens in this building.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.970
I run the Lazarus program.

11:49.970 --> 11:53.060
My name is James.

11:53.060 --> 11:58.369
Most importantly,
I am your father.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.595
I know everyone is scared.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.770
You're wondering where
all the capable people went.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.599
Well, I will tell you,
they went to 1988

12:10.599 --> 12:12.601
to help themselves.
- Whatever.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.689
Fear not.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.865
A powerful leader
still remains.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.649
Me.
- This guy's gotta be joking.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.042
- Get a load of this guy.
- Judah,

12:19.042 --> 12:20.435
if you didn't know my name.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.089
- He's full of himself.
- Together we will get

12:22.089 --> 12:24.395
through this hardship.
We will--

12:24.395 --> 12:26.180
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey, come on.

12:28.225 --> 12:32.490
Hey, we don't need
anyone else.

12:32.490 --> 12:35.145
We've always gotten by.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.669
I know. I'm just thinking
about something.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.019
What is it? Tell me.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.151
We're over here!
We need some help! Please!

12:41.151 --> 12:43.632
- Who is it?
- It's Scott and Lucas.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.068
- They're back.
- Is he okay?

12:45.068 --> 12:48.811
Come on.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.291
What happened to him?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.727
Are you guys okay?

12:51.727 --> 12:54.164
Uh,
that's a relative question.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.775
We tried to get
into the Lazarus building,

12:55.775 --> 12:59.474
but its bouncers bounced us.
We gotta get him to the bus.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.563
Any first aid stuff we have
would be great, too.

13:01.563 --> 13:04.174
Please, grab whatever you can.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.175
- We should help.
- Be careful.

13:05.175 --> 13:08.004
- Come on.
- Sorry. Yeah.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.528
Let me see if I can find something.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.703
Okay.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.104
You're my father?

13:21.104 --> 13:26.283
The last time I saw you,

13:26.283 --> 13:27.545
you were an infant.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.116
I have dreamed about the day

13:33.116 --> 13:36.598
that I could tell you everything.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.339
And now you're here,

13:38.339 --> 13:40.689
and I don't know
where to start.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.262
Why didn't you come for me?

13:50.264 --> 13:55.095
I grew up less than
a day's walk from here.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.880
And you never came looking
for me. Why?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.708
Trust me,
if I knew where you were,

13:59.708 --> 14:03.407
I would have moved heaven
and Earth to get you back.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.454
Give me a chance
to explain everything.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.283
Come. There--there's
so much you need to know.

14:14.462 --> 14:17.378
You want to know
about our family, our history,

14:17.378 --> 14:19.380
this building
is at the center of it.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.687
In fact, the day I learned
your mother was pregnant

14:22.687 --> 14:24.864
is the day I dreamed it up.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.519
Truth is,
all of this is for you.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.609
For me?

14:31.609 --> 14:33.046
My dream was to fix the world

14:33.046 --> 14:35.613
so that you would have
a better future.

14:35.613 --> 14:36.919
Because where we're from,

14:36.919 --> 14:39.095
the Earth can no longer
sustain itself.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.490
Famine, extinction,
lack of resources...

14:44.622 --> 14:47.625
Our planet is dying.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.975
Where are we from?

14:48.975 --> 14:53.066
Los Angeles in the year 2076.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.807
That's when I conceived
of the Lazarus Program

14:55.807 --> 14:57.809
and its efforts to reverse

14:57.809 --> 14:59.463
the damage the humans
have done.

15:01.857 --> 15:04.947
And how does being
in 10,000 B.C. fix the future?

15:04.947 --> 15:07.907
Natural resources, Gavin.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.648
In the future,
we're running out.

15:10.648 --> 15:15.131
But everything we need
is still right here.

15:15.131 --> 15:21.442
The solution has always been
in the past.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.666
This bay holds
over 1,000 species

15:28.666 --> 15:30.146
of plant life for study.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.974
- It's incredible.
- Mm-hmm.

15:33.889 --> 15:34.977
Don't worry
about the sabertooths.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.153
They're all caged.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.155
We have a thriving
animal research facility

15:39.155 --> 15:40.809
that we hope will offer insight

15:40.809 --> 15:42.985
into correcting
the genetic flaws

15:42.985 --> 15:44.552
that led to their extinction.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.424
Everything we learned
we send back to 2076

15:47.424 --> 15:51.602
so these tragedies
will never happen again.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.169
Any of this familiar at all?

15:53.169 --> 15:55.606
Nope. Should it be?

15:55.606 --> 15:57.695
Oh, I suppose
you were too young to remember,

15:57.695 --> 15:59.001
but you used to love it here.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.351
We'd play hide-and-seek.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.093
I'd read you the Latin names
of all the flora.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.269
Oh, look, look, look.

16:06.269 --> 16:10.012
This is a kind of species
of <i>Doritifera.</i>

16:10.012 --> 16:12.188
It has a-a venom
that we're extracting

16:12.188 --> 16:14.408
and synthesizing
to create a vaccine

16:14.408 --> 16:18.673
that hopefully protect
livestock from disease.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.196
It's this kind
of out-of-the-box thinking

16:20.196 --> 16:24.244
that I am certain
will heal the world.

16:24.244 --> 16:28.030
You didn't create
all of this by yourself.

16:28.030 --> 16:31.642
So where is
the rest of your team?

16:31.642 --> 16:35.777
You mean Aldridge,
your grandfather...

16:35.777 --> 16:40.564
and, uh... your mother.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.871
Why isn't she here?

16:42.871 --> 16:44.960
Why is my mother in 1988?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.051
You're telling me
a really interesting story,

16:49.051 --> 16:52.533
but it's not what I heard
from Silas and Aldridge.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.838
We built something incredible,

16:53.838 --> 16:58.365
and then it broke us apart.

16:58.365 --> 17:02.717
I have deep regret
about losing them...

17:02.717 --> 17:05.067
regret about losing you.

17:05.067 --> 17:09.550
And then one day you show up

17:09.550 --> 17:11.421
trying to get
into the building.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.293
So, son, I've been doing
a lot of talking.

17:13.293 --> 17:18.385
I should be asking you,
why did you come back here?

17:18.385 --> 17:22.171
To reunite my own family.

17:22.171 --> 17:24.782
Nothing would make me happier
than to help you.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.921
It's just up ahead.

17:32.921 --> 17:37.143
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:37.143 --> 17:41.451
How you holding up?
- Just trying to stay focused.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.800
I'm sorry.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.063
I'm sure it tore you up

17:44.063 --> 17:45.455
watching what happened
to Gavin today.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.114
You know, for what it's worth,

17:52.114 --> 17:54.334
I had a bit of a rough patch
with my wife.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.423
I understand
what you're going through.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.600
Hmm.
How did you do it?

17:59.600 --> 18:02.342
How did you find your way
back to her?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.996
Well, let's just say it was
a lot of hard work

18:04.996 --> 18:06.998
and a lot of "I'm sorrys."

18:06.998 --> 18:09.958
But we're better for it now.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.960
We're here.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.229
Behind that grate
is a passageway

18:20.229 --> 18:23.972
which will lead us
directly to Lazarus.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.023
Holy crap.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.424
We're in its territory.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.861
If we go any closer,
that bird will attack.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.657
I'm gonna distract it.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.006
You guys head for the tunnel.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.834
- Eve.
- This is not a debate.

18:59.834 --> 19:03.403
Hey! Over here!

19:03.403 --> 19:06.101
Up here! Right here.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.320
Over here!

19:07.320 --> 19:08.886
Okay, get ready to run.

19:08.886 --> 19:13.891
Come on! Over here!

19:13.891 --> 19:16.677
- Move, move!
- Come on.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.422
Let's go.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.337
Go, go, go.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.567
Mom, come on!
Come on!

19:37.567 --> 19:39.961
Mom, please, come on.
Come on, Mom!

19:39.961 --> 19:42.311
Watch out!

19:42.311 --> 19:44.183
What?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.404
- Come on.
- Hurry up. You got it!

19:48.796 --> 19:50.711
Inside. Get in.

19:50.711 --> 19:54.280
Ahh!

20:10.774 --> 20:12.907
Uh, marks have spread.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.691
How can we help him?

20:17.781 --> 20:19.435
A proper tourniquet.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.263
Before we all fell down here,
I used to get high

20:21.263 --> 20:23.134
and watch survivalist videos
on YouTube.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.963
I saw this guy make one
out of scarves and a metal rod.

20:25.963 --> 20:30.011
- Let's do it.
- Hey. I found some aloe.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.187
Great. Put some on his arm.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.276
Scott and I need to go grab
a few things.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.769
Hey.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.126
You all right?
- Yeah.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.304
If you say so.

21:06.830 --> 21:10.051
Veronica, what is it?

21:10.051 --> 21:13.402
I know there are a lot
more important things going on,

21:13.402 --> 21:15.317
but I thought it was weird

21:15.317 --> 21:18.451
that you went to that building
and you didn't tell me.

21:18.451 --> 21:21.192
I mean...

21:21.192 --> 21:22.672
you were about
to leave forever,

21:22.672 --> 21:25.458
and you didn't say goodbye.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.722
I didn't really think
about it, Veronica.

21:28.722 --> 21:32.813
It's just...

21:32.813 --> 21:34.641
you saved my life.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.164
I helped you, too.

21:36.164 --> 21:39.733
I thought--I just--
I thought we'd become friends.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.664
You've harnessed an Aurora.

21:57.664 --> 22:01.885
The black rock contains uranium.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.671
We extract it, refine it,

22:04.671 --> 22:08.196
and use it
to power this machine.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.416
And I can just walk
through it

22:10.416 --> 22:12.592
and it'll bring me to 1988?

22:12.592 --> 22:13.984
No.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.421
Gavin, there must be
some mistake.

22:15.421 --> 22:19.033
The portal goes to 2076,
the year we're from.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.951
Aldridge told me
it goes to '88.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.040
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.390
She wasn't lying to me.

22:28.390 --> 22:31.045
Aldridge has always played
her own game.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.221
I-if you've spent more than
an hour in her company,

22:33.221 --> 22:37.051
you'll understand
what I'm talking about.

22:37.051 --> 22:39.401
Why do I feel like
you're playing a game.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.924
You've shown me your building.
You've talked

22:40.924 --> 22:42.404
about all these amazing things
you're doing.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.407
All I want is the truth.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.715
I'm not gonna give up
until I get my son back.

22:48.715 --> 22:51.065
Of course you're not.

22:51.065 --> 22:54.068
That's not
what our family does.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.418
But we do know
when we need help.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.811
Let me do that for you.

22:57.811 --> 23:02.903
I will try to find a way
back to my grandson.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.557
Stay here. There's more
I need to show you.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.732
I can help you.

23:05.732 --> 23:08.996
Just please stay.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.131
Okay, connections look good.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.571
Ready?
- Yeah.

23:18.571 --> 23:19.702
Here we go.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.498
Systems are coming online
over here.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.934
Great job, guys.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.153
- Then we're coming back.
<i>- No.</i>

23:36.153 --> 23:38.112
I'm about to sequence
a huge chunk of code.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.722
Should take about 30 minutes.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.638
Need you guys to stay there
in case we blow another fuse.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.684
Then we'll wait.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.729
You know,
I used to play hockey.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.601
You play hockey?

23:48.601 --> 23:51.299
I was terrible.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.823
But my dad thought
I was amazing.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.130
He had this vision for me
as a left-winger,

23:56.130 --> 23:59.307
so I gave it a shot.

23:59.307 --> 24:02.615
I hated how much he pushed me.

24:02.615 --> 24:06.575
But now I'd give anything
just to hear his voice again.

24:08.229 --> 24:12.929
Yeah, I-I miss my dad, too.

24:12.929 --> 24:15.236
If this doesn't work,

24:15.236 --> 24:17.978
my dad is gonna be
in the path of that tidal wave.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.502
He's a teenager here in 1988.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.982
He doesn't make it,
neither do I.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.550
So that means
I basically cease to exist,

24:24.550 --> 24:26.943
right?
- Hey, that's not gonna happen.

24:26.943 --> 24:30.512
Okay?
You're both gonna be fine.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.827
What are you doing?

24:40.827 --> 24:43.699
You're really that bad
at skating,

24:43.699 --> 24:45.484
I gotta see it.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.702
Are you insane?

24:46.702 --> 24:49.183
We're on a mission
to save Santa Monica.

24:50.010 --> 24:53.927
Come on. We can have
five minutes of fun.

25:06.548 --> 25:10.465
Attention, all skaters,
the rink is now open.

25:26.176 --> 25:30.267
<i>♪ I've been meaning
to tell you ♪</i>

25:30.267 --> 25:34.750

Whoa.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.598
<i>Where are you?</i>

25:57.773 --> 26:00.950
Josh? Riley? Where are you?

26:00.950 --> 26:02.169
We're here. What's wrong?

26:02.169 --> 26:03.910
Kill the power. Now.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.738
- What about the virus?
- They found me.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.000
- Down here!
- Do it. Now!

26:08.610 --> 26:09.916
Down here.

26:15.530 --> 26:16.923
And don't forget

26:16.923 --> 26:18.185
to eat your Wheaties.

26:25.714 --> 26:25.932
<i>...</i>

26:25.932 --> 26:29.805
Ahh, dude.

26:29.805 --> 26:32.242
Augh.
- There we go.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.201
Whew.
You sure that's on right?

26:34.201 --> 26:35.463
I can't feel my fingers.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.683
Yeah.
That's kind of the point.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.555
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.035
Anymore questionable
medical advice

26:42.035 --> 26:43.776
before I try to sleep?

26:43.776 --> 26:44.951
Yes.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.565
Be nice to people.
Because when you're kind,

26:50.565 --> 26:54.395
sometimes they'll even
bring you surprises.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.223
- Is it bourbon?
- It is not.

26:58.486 --> 27:01.315
- Oh, Baby Ruth. Sweet.
- Yeah.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.708
Judah's been handing these out,

27:02.708 --> 27:03.883
trying to prove to people

27:03.883 --> 27:05.101
that he's a good leader
or something.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.407
I got us a few. Whoa.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.974
Nope.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.672
This is a reward
for good behavior.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.500
And at this moment,
I don't think you've earned it.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.675
Dude, I am in pain.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.895
I have earned anything I want.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.766
I heard Veronica talking
to Ella.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.725
And I can't help but suspect

27:19.725 --> 27:22.118
that she may have
feelings for you.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.033
No, that's not what she said, dude.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.339
She didn't have to.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.993
I'm a keen observer
of the human condition.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.169
Oh, my God, Scott.
What is your point?

27:30.736 --> 27:33.608
You said you made
a promise to your mum

27:33.608 --> 27:35.828
to try and be a better man.

27:35.828 --> 27:39.179
Better doesn't always mean
some big hero move.

27:39.179 --> 27:42.965
Sometimes the hero move
is just a bit of decency.

27:42.965 --> 27:45.707
Scott...

27:45.707 --> 27:47.535
just give me
the damn Baby Ruth.

27:47.535 --> 27:48.710
When I'm convinced

27:48.710 --> 27:50.364
you've actually learned something,

27:50.364 --> 27:54.194
then you can have one.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.892
I'll check on you later.

27:58.328 --> 28:01.331
Caroline?

28:01.331 --> 28:03.899
They trashed the place.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.292
Caroline.

28:08.861 --> 28:12.342
They took her.
- Maybe they stole the virus.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.302
- I'll call the cops.
- And tell them what?

28:15.302 --> 28:16.738
That you're from the future

28:16.738 --> 28:17.870
and that you're grandmother
from the further future

28:17.870 --> 28:21.438
is missing?
They'll lock us up.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.919
Remember the last thing
she said?

28:23.919 --> 28:25.442
About eating our Wheaties?

28:34.800 --> 28:38.151
- What the hell is that?
- No idea.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.282
My dad would know.

28:39.282 --> 28:42.764
Would be great
if we could talk to him.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.331
Maybe we can.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.773
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

28:51.773 --> 28:54.776
So what's the plan here?

28:54.776 --> 28:56.647
Caroline said
there was a way to 1988

28:56.647 --> 28:58.562
in that building in 10,000 B.C.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.347
If I can tell that
to my teenage dad,

29:00.347 --> 29:02.349
then he'll have a memory of it
as an adult.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.654
Okay.

29:03.654 --> 29:04.743
So then my dad will know

29:04.743 --> 29:05.700
to go into that portal
down there

29:05.700 --> 29:07.006
so he can meet us up here.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.921
This is crazy.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.879
We have to do something, Josh.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.620
What other choice do we have?

29:17.277 --> 29:19.105
Let me do this myself, okay?

29:19.105 --> 29:22.412
Okay.

29:22.412 --> 29:23.631
- See ya.
- I'll call you.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.677
Gross.

29:26.677 --> 29:30.594
Excuse me. You're Sam, right?

29:32.074 --> 29:34.033
Do I know you?

29:34.033 --> 29:35.251
Oh, my God,
are you stoned?

29:35.251 --> 29:37.863
No. Narc.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.952
This is just
so disappointing.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.519
Oh, cool,
giving me your digits?

29:42.519 --> 29:43.869
Ew. No.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.088
Please, just stop talking.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.223
Listen to me,
I know you don't know who I am,

29:50.223 --> 29:51.267
but you have to trust me.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.792
This is really,
really important.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.186
I need you to read this note
and commit it to memory.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.840
It's not gonna make any sense
to you right now,

29:58.840 --> 30:00.668
but it will when you're older.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.843
Okay. Are you, like,
a crazy person?

30:01.843 --> 30:03.279
Sam, look me in the eyes
right now

30:03.279 --> 30:05.107
and tell me you'll remember. Please.

30:06.935 --> 30:10.112
- Okay. Okay, I got it.
- Good.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.898
One more thing.
Promise me that in three days

30:12.898 --> 30:15.422
you'll make sure
you're not in Santa Monica.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.685
Why?

30:17.685 --> 30:20.166
If you don't leave town,
I guarantee you'll regret it.

30:20.166 --> 30:21.907
All right. Okay.
You're freaking me out.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.299
Sam, there are
a lot of things

30:23.299 --> 30:25.127
you're gonna do in your life

30:25.127 --> 30:28.739
and a lot of people
that are gonna count on you...

30:28.739 --> 30:31.612
and love you.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.615
Please don't let them down.

30:34.615 --> 30:39.315
Okay. All right.
I promise.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.449
Okay.

30:49.064 --> 30:53.416
No cameras here.
We're in a utility tunnel.

30:53.416 --> 30:57.203
Easy access
to an auxiliary security room.

30:57.203 --> 31:01.381
There we can connect
with the building's video feed,

31:01.381 --> 31:03.644
find Gavin,
get you to the portal.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.909
Look me in the eyes right now
and tell me you'll remember.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.913
It's the strangest thing.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.654
It's like I've got
a new memory.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.699
A memory of what?

31:15.699 --> 31:18.485
Of Riley.

31:18.485 --> 31:22.445
She found me in '88.

31:22.445 --> 31:23.925
She wrote me a note.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.927
She said there's a portal here
that can reach them.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.886
Is she with Josh?
Are they okay?

31:27.886 --> 31:30.932
I don't know.
But the note said

31:32.325 --> 31:35.067
they'll be waiting for us
at the Santa Monica boardwalk.

31:35.067 --> 31:38.722
We need to move now.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.944
Go. Go, go!

31:42.944 --> 31:45.251
Stop. Don't move.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.921
Have you thought
about my offer to stay?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.968
My whole life I've wanted
answers about who I am

32:06.968 --> 32:09.579
and where I came from.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.538
Now I've got my father
standing here

32:11.538 --> 32:14.497
ready to give them.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.499
Yet I can sense
your hesitation.

32:16.499 --> 32:19.720
I can't stay.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.028
I have to get back
to my wife and daughter.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.682
Yeah.

32:25.682 --> 32:30.557
I told you...
I want to help--

32:30.557 --> 32:32.776
But I don't think
that I can trust you.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.778
You've been doing your best
to try and convince me

32:34.778 --> 32:38.478
that I can...

32:38.478 --> 32:39.914
but why do I feel
like you're only telling me

32:39.914 --> 32:40.915
part of the truth?

32:45.485 --> 32:48.227
You're right.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.532
I wanted you to see
some of the good

32:49.532 --> 32:51.491
before you learned the rest.
Please, sit down.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.797
I-I-I want to show you
something else.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.715
You want to know who you are.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.328
This is where it all starts.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.599
That's my mother?

33:12.599 --> 33:13.817
You were
the most important thing

33:13.817 --> 33:18.344
to both of us.

33:18.344 --> 33:21.042
Then answer
what I already asked.

33:21.042 --> 33:24.132
Why was I taken away?

33:24.132 --> 33:26.395
Why did my grandfather raise me
in that village

33:26.395 --> 33:29.920
unless he knew
that he couldn't trust you?

33:32.314 --> 33:36.231
Back then
he was right not to.

33:36.231 --> 33:39.365
I have made mistakes.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.802
I'm not a perfect person.

33:41.802 --> 33:43.543
But I've looked hard
at my failures,

33:43.543 --> 33:45.936
and I've learned a better way.

33:45.936 --> 33:49.462
Wouldn't you hope
that your own children

33:49.462 --> 33:52.465
would give you a second chance?

33:52.465 --> 33:57.557
I am asking you to stay...

33:57.557 --> 33:59.994
and give me a chance
to prove myself

33:59.994 --> 34:01.691
worthy of your trust.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.304
Excuse me, James.

34:05.304 --> 34:06.435
We have a situation.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.096
Gavin. Hey.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.492
Are you okay?

34:24.149 --> 34:25.846
This is my wife and daughter.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.153
It's a pleasure to meet you.

34:28.153 --> 34:31.069
My name is James.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.679
You said they were safe.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.463
They were caught
sneaking around.

34:34.463 --> 34:35.682
No matter the time,

34:35.682 --> 34:37.075
that's still called trespassing.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.685
Well, that's the least
egregious crime

34:38.685 --> 34:40.948
committed in this building.

34:40.948 --> 34:43.385
It's been a long time, Silas.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.343
So what
have you been filling

34:44.343 --> 34:45.996
the boy's head with today?

34:45.996 --> 34:47.520
Details.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.261
Yeah, the ones that I'm sure
you conveniently left out.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.872
Only thing Gavin needs
to know is you're dangerous.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.613
Silas, we don't have time
to argue, okay?

34:53.613 --> 34:55.136
We've got bigger problems
right now.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.225
What do you mean?

34:57.225 --> 34:59.662
Aldridge was wrong.

34:59.662 --> 35:00.881
Portal doesn't go to '88.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.578
- Yes, it does.
- No.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.232
Riley found me in '88.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.886
And she gave me a message.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.367
She said a woman named Caroline
used the portal

35:08.367 --> 35:09.716
to go there herself.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.548
- You lied to me.
- Of course he did.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.071
You swore to me
that you were gonna help me

35:17.071 --> 35:19.204
find my son.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.422
You knew the answers all along.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.511
Why-why the hell
did you do that?

35:22.511 --> 35:25.645
Because I didn't want
to lose you again.

35:25.645 --> 35:27.864
I knew you would leave.

35:27.864 --> 35:32.391
It was foolish. I was wrong.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.914
I was afraid.

35:36.960 --> 35:40.225
You want another chance
to prove yourself to me?

35:40.225 --> 35:42.923
Well, this is it.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.360
You can start
by letting Silas go

35:45.360 --> 35:48.189
and by letting us use
that portal.

35:55.109 --> 35:58.068
Scott said you needed me?

36:01.202 --> 36:03.248
Can you come here?

36:08.122 --> 36:09.732
When I said I didn't think
about saying goodbye

36:09.732 --> 36:11.169
before I left--

36:13.475 --> 36:15.477
I wanted to, but I--

36:17.305 --> 36:18.828
I just didn't.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.875
Why not?

36:21.875 --> 36:23.268
Because I've been burned

36:23.268 --> 36:25.748
by basically everyone
I've gotten close to.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.798
Now I just kind of--
- Shut off.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.761
Yeah.

36:38.761 --> 36:42.461
I've been burned too.

36:42.461 --> 36:44.506
I'm not good
at this stuff either.

36:47.509 --> 36:50.643
But maybe...

36:50.643 --> 36:53.863
we could be a little less bad
at it together.

36:59.739 --> 37:03.525
If we were back in our LA...

37:03.525 --> 37:05.658
I'd take you to this bar
I love on the water.

37:05.658 --> 37:10.053
It's, uh... kind of a dump.

37:10.053 --> 37:14.667
But, uh,
there's something about it.

37:14.667 --> 37:18.410
You can relax there.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.108
But since we can't do that,

37:21.108 --> 37:24.720
would you like to share
this melted candy bar with me?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.203
- I would.
- Here.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.295
What?

37:34.295 --> 37:36.341
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.125
No.

37:38.473 --> 37:40.867
No.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.651
Oh, my God.
We're gonna figure this out.

37:42.651 --> 37:44.871
Okay? Hey. We're gonna fig--

37:44.871 --> 37:46.699
We're gonna fix this, okay?

37:46.699 --> 37:48.527
Uh...

37:48.527 --> 37:52.226
Lucas.

37:52.226 --> 37:55.273
Hey, Lucas. Lucas!

37:57.275 --> 37:59.189
Help!

38:06.196 --> 38:09.330
Unbelievable.

38:09.330 --> 38:13.334
It's right where Riley said
it would be.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.694
Go find your son.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.742
Just take it back. Yes.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.096
Thanks for not giving up
on me.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.576
After you were taken,
all I could think about

38:37.576 --> 38:39.491
was getting you back.

38:39.491 --> 38:43.321
I couldn't imagine our lives
without you, Gavin.

38:50.328 --> 38:54.419
All set?

38:56.290 --> 38:57.378
See you guys there.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.622
Let's go get Josh.

39:34.459 --> 39:38.419
You searched for your son
for years.

39:38.419 --> 39:42.902
Why did you just let him go?

39:42.902 --> 39:47.863
Because if I didn't,
he'd never come back to me.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.914
Do you think it worked?

39:54.914 --> 39:56.394
If nothing else,
we should get points

39:56.394 --> 39:57.743
for creativity.

39:57.743 --> 39:58.700
That another way of saying
you think

39:58.700 --> 40:00.267
it was a waste of time?

40:00.267 --> 40:03.923
No, it was my way of saying
you keep impressing me.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.841
Should we wait
another ten minutes?

40:08.841 --> 40:10.408
It's fine with me.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.281
Sunset, good-looking woman,

40:14.281 --> 40:18.851
some real food over there--
there's worst places to be.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.262
Not bad.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.092
Riley!

40:44.703 --> 40:46.444
There they are.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.402
- Josh!
- Riley!

40:48.402 --> 40:51.536
- Dad?
- Riley!

40:51.536 --> 40:53.799
Dad! Dad!

41:02.285 --> 41:04.505
- You came.
- Thanks to you.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.435
You made it.

41:32.664 --> 41:37.233
Oh.
Welcome back to LA.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.322
I don't think
that was a normal earthquake

41:39.322 --> 41:42.282
I think that was because
of what's about to happen.

41:42.282 --> 41:44.066
What are you talking about?

41:44.066 --> 41:47.287
Another sinkhole's coming
like the one at La Brea.

41:47.287 --> 41:50.551
But this one,
and every other sinkhole,

41:50.551 --> 41:52.379
we might be able to stop.
