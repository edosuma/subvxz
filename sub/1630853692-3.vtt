A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.002
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE

00:36.069 --> 00:38.972
A SLOW SEARING RIDE
ON SATAN'S CAROUSEL

00:39.038 --> 00:41.174
OR WATCHING HELPLESSLY BY

00:41.241 --> 00:43.710
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND
GOT IT ON WITH YOUR LOVER,

00:43.777 --> 00:46.079
WHAT CHOICE
WOULD YOU MAKE ?

00:46.146 --> 00:48.815
I'M TODD McFARLANE,
CREATOR OF "SPAWN".

00:48.882 --> 00:50.884
A CRUDE SCENARIO
I'VE JUST PAINTED ?

00:50.950 --> 00:51.885
POSSIBLY,

00:51.951 --> 00:54.187
BUT HELL ISN'T
SUBTLE, FOLKS.

00:54.254 --> 00:55.922
AND IT'S A SITUATION
LIKE THIS

00:55.989 --> 00:58.925
THAT'S HELL'S LITTLE WAY
OF SHOWING SPAWN

00:58.992 --> 01:01.494
THAT HELL ISN'T JUST A<i> PLACE,</i>
BUT A STATE OF MIND.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.363
AND FIRE,
WHILE PAINFUL,

01:03.430 --> 01:06.866
ISN'T THE ONLY WAY
MALEBOLGIA CAN BURN HIM.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.436
YES, SPAWN IS LEARNING,
BUT ALL THE WHILE

01:09.502 --> 01:12.071
THE BLACK TENTACLES OF EVIL
ARE STARTING TO SPREAD.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.573
AND AS YOU'LL SEE,

01:13.640 --> 01:16.543
HELL IS ALIVE
AND WELL ON EARTH.

01:24.584 --> 01:28.955
THERE'S A WAR ON
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.793
YOU'RE GONNA TELL TONY
TO KEEP HIS GOONS

01:33.860 --> 01:35.428
OUT OF THESE ALLEYS.

01:35.495 --> 01:37.397
FIND OUT WHO
WHACKED MY MEN

01:37.464 --> 01:38.565
OR YOU'RE GONNA
NEED A PRIEST !

01:38.631 --> 01:40.934
TWIST DOESN'T LIKE GETTING
SPANKED THIS HARD.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.069
THERE'S GONNA BE
A WAR DOWN HERE

01:43.136 --> 01:45.238
UNLESS WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.507
RUMOR HAS IT THEY WERE
TRACKING SOMEONE HIGH UP.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.609
I AM A
UNITED STATES SENATOR !!

01:49.676 --> 01:51.277
SORRY FOR THE
INCONVENIENCE, SENATOR.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.246
JESUS, WYNN !

01:53.313 --> 01:54.547
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT ?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.483
IT'S ABOUT US,
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.585
I WANNA PUT YOU IN
THE WHITE HOUSE, SENATOR.

01:58.651 --> 01:59.419
AND IF I REFUSE ?

01:59.486 --> 02:02.155
WHO'S GOING TO
PROTECT YOUR SON

02:02.222 --> 02:04.224
FROM NEW YORK'S FINEST ?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.226
I HEAR THE CONS ON RIKERS
DESPISE CHILD KILLERS.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.827
WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE PROBLEM ?

02:07.894 --> 02:09.496
I WANT THE PIECE
OF SHIT RESPONSIBLE.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.397
BRING ME HIS BONES
IN ONE BAG

02:11.464 --> 02:13.366
AND HIS ORGANS
IN ANOTHER.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.503
AND NOW, "SPAWN",
SO TURN OFF YOUR LIGHTS.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.458
( man struggling )

03:19.132 --> 03:21.000
PLEASE, I DIDN'T
SEE NOTHING !

03:21.067 --> 03:22.669
<i>SHUT UP.</i>

03:23.836 --> 03:26.839
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO VERY RECENTLY

03:26.906 --> 03:29.776
KILLED A HANDFUL
OF GREASY WISE GUYS.

03:29.842 --> 03:33.179
ARE YOU AWARE
OF SUCH A PERSON ?

03:33.246 --> 03:35.415
DON'T KILL ME,
PLEASE.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.150
I'M NOT WORTH IT,
I'M NOTHING.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.052
I'M LESS
THAN NOTHING !

03:39.118 --> 03:40.787
I KEEP TO MYSELF.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.256
ARE YOU AWARE
OF SUCH A PERSON ?!

03:43.323 --> 03:44.490
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,

03:44.557 --> 03:46.793
I'VE SEEN HIM,
SCARY GUY.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.928
HE'S BE HANGING AROUND
DOWN IN RAT CITY--

03:48.995 --> 03:50.897
DEEP ALLEY.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.665
NOBODY GOES
BACK THERE.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.001
IT'S A<i> PIT.</i>

03:56.703 --> 03:59.539
YOU'RE SURE
THIS IS THE PERSON

03:59.606 --> 04:01.975
WHO KILLED
MY EMPLOYER'S MEN ?

04:02.041 --> 04:02.909
YEAH,

04:02.976 --> 04:04.410
RIPPED THEM APART.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.613
HE SEEMED TO ENJOY IT
A LITTLE, YOU KNOW ?

04:06.679 --> 04:08.081
I<i> DO</i> KNOW.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.582
CAN I GO ?

04:09.649 --> 04:11.217
IN A MOMENT.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.820
FIRST I NEED TO
BORROW SOMETHING.

04:13.886 --> 04:15.989
NO, NO !

04:28.267 --> 04:31.504
( narrator )
THEY ALL PICK A PLACE
TO CALL HOME.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.873
IN MOST INSTANCES

04:33.940 --> 04:36.542
THOSE PLACES
HAVE A HIDDEN POWER.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.878
FOR<i> THIS</i> WARRIOR...

04:38.945 --> 04:41.848
THE ALLEYS
ARE NO DIFFERENT.

04:41.914 --> 04:45.084
HE IS DRAWN BACK
AGAIN AND AGAIN

04:45.151 --> 04:47.954
AND DOESN'T KNOW WHY.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.957
( men whispering )

05:00.767 --> 05:02.602
( man )
"HERO,

05:02.669 --> 05:04.971
MIDNIGHT BE WAITING."

05:05.038 --> 05:08.174
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN ?

05:09.942 --> 05:12.078
LOOK AT THE SHIT
YOU BROUGHT US, MAN.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.147
I HOPE
YOU'RE HAPPY.

05:14.213 --> 05:15.581
IT WAS<i> HORRIBLE.</i>

05:15.648 --> 05:17.617
WE COULDN'T
STOP HIM.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.186
JUST WATCHED AS
HE TORE HIM APART !

05:20.253 --> 05:21.454
JUST ONE ?

05:21.521 --> 05:22.755
YEAH.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.058
HE WAS A<i> BIG</i>
SON-OF-A-BITCH.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.126
HAD LIKE WEAPONS
AND OTHER CRAP

05:27.193 --> 05:28.628
COMING OUT
HIS ARMS

05:28.695 --> 05:30.296
AND THIS<i> EYE--</i>

05:30.363 --> 05:33.366
GLOWING RED
LIKE BLOOD.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.134
HE WAS LOOKING
FOR THE PERSON

05:35.201 --> 05:37.036
WHO WHACKED SOME
BIG SHOT'S HIT MAN.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.871
EVEN WHEN HE
TOLD HIM EVERYTHING,

05:38.938 --> 05:40.406
HE STILL KILLED HIM !

05:40.473 --> 05:41.874
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO ?!

05:58.458 --> 06:02.261
IT'S EXACTLY
12:00 MIDNIGHT IN NAIROBI.

06:06.365 --> 06:10.036
( man )
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT THE GUY
WHO TOOK OUT TONY'S MEN.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.176
TELL ME IT'S SOMEBODY
WITH SOME<i> BALLS.</i>

06:17.243 --> 06:19.412
AND NOT SOME
NO TALENT ASSHOLE

06:19.479 --> 06:21.347
IN A FAGGY OUTFIT !

06:22.949 --> 06:25.184
( narrator )
WHEN THREATENED,

06:25.251 --> 06:28.387
SPAWN RESORTS
TO WHAT HE KNOWS...

06:28.855 --> 06:32.158
HIS INGRAINED
INSTINCT TO SURVIVE.

07:58.911 --> 08:02.114
THOUGH THE UNIFORM
WILL OFTEN PROTECT HIM,

08:02.181 --> 08:06.219
A SPAWN IS
NOT INVINCIBLE.

08:06.285 --> 08:09.088
EACH BATTLE
DRAINS HIS STRENGTH,

08:09.155 --> 08:12.124
PROPELLING HIM TOWARD
THE INEVITABLE,

08:12.191 --> 08:15.428
HIS FINAL DECENT
INTO HELL.

08:20.766 --> 08:23.536
WHAT A<i> MESS.</i>

08:23.603 --> 08:24.770
AL !

08:26.339 --> 08:27.773
AL !

08:27.840 --> 08:29.508
DON'T WASTE
YOUR BREATH.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.010
AL ?!

AL !

08:39.418 --> 08:40.319
AL !

08:54.634 --> 08:57.937
TRYING TO HIDE
FROM EMOTIONAL TORMENT...

08:59.505 --> 09:00.806
NEW WARRIORS

09:00.873 --> 09:03.776
ALWAYS SEEK
THEIR<i> OLD</i> WAYS FIRST.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.982
THIS LATEST SPAWN

09:10.049 --> 09:11.951
IS NO EXCEPTION.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.389
A<i> KILLER</i>

09:16.455 --> 09:18.791
IN NEED OF HIS TOOLS.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.021
( Spawn )
WELCOME HOME, AL.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.891
NICE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.773
( man )
THIS IS THE CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

10:07.840 --> 10:09.809
SECURITY SHIP
COMMANDER.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.510
YOU HAVE ENTERED

10:11.577 --> 10:13.646
A RESTRICTED ORDNANCE
STORAGE FACILITY.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.648
COME OUT
HANDS HIGH

10:15.715 --> 10:18.284
OR WE WILL
OPEN FIRE !

10:25.391 --> 10:28.260
GO HOT AS SOON AS YOU HAVE
TARGET ACQUISITION.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.735
( man )
FIRE.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.955
THE FIRST TELEPORTATION
IS THE WORST.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.057
COMING AS UNEXPECTEDLY

10:58.124 --> 11:00.092
AS HAVING
THE HOSTS' UNIFORM

11:00.159 --> 11:02.328
SAVE THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.130
IF HE'S DEAD,
JUST LEAVE HIM !

11:04.196 --> 11:06.499
HE'S PROBABLY
BETTER OFF.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.667
FIND DRUGS

11:08.734 --> 11:11.103
AND DEAD BODIES
EVERYWHERE.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.574
HEY, AL,
YOU OKAY ?

11:15.641 --> 11:18.244
JUST NEED
A SECOND.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.246
COME BACK TO DO
SOME<i> MORE</i> DAMAGE ?

11:20.312 --> 11:22.415
WE AIN'T GOT ENOUGH
DEAD AND WOUNDED ?

11:22.481 --> 11:23.516
HEY, C'MON,
BOBBY !

11:23.582 --> 11:24.884
CAN'T YOU SEE
HE'S LAID UP ?!

11:24.950 --> 11:26.652
HE AIN'T
THE ONLY ONE !

11:26.719 --> 11:28.487
SEE THE
NORTH ALLEY LATELY ?

11:28.554 --> 11:30.756
LOOKS LIKE
FREAKIN' BEIRUT.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.591
LOOK AT HIM NOW.

11:32.658 --> 11:35.327
MAN'S GOT MORE GUNS
THAN THE NATIONAL GUARD.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.296
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF<i> PSYCHO</i> ?

11:37.363 --> 11:39.298
I'M JUST
PROTECTING MYSELF.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.566
OH, YEAH ?

11:40.633 --> 11:43.436
WHO'S GONNA
PROTECT<i> US</i> FROM<i> YOU</i> ?

11:43.502 --> 11:45.838
WHAT THE HELL
ARE<i> YOU</i> LOOKING AT ?

11:45.905 --> 11:47.139
<i> YOU.</i>

11:47.206 --> 11:50.476
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND
LIKE THE OUTSIDE.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.155
( man )
I CAN GET YOUR
THERMALS BACK UP

12:03.222 --> 12:05.091
AND YOUR FULL
U.V. SPECS.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.526
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE
SIGNIFICANT RED SHIFT

12:07.593 --> 12:09.562
IN YOUR SCAN.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.964
THIS IS PATCHWORK
AT BEST.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.033
CAN I USE THE EYE,

12:14.100 --> 12:16.035
YES OR NO ?

12:16.102 --> 12:17.603
YES,

12:17.670 --> 12:19.939
BUT NO EXTENDED NIGHT VISION
OR CLOSE-UP READING.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.919
KNOCK, KNOCK.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.658
( man )
I WANT SOMEONE MONITORING
THE PHONES ALL DAY.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.694
IF OVERKILL
DOESN'T CALL

12:41.760 --> 12:43.996
I WANT HIM FOUND
AND BROUGHT TO<i> ME.</i>

12:44.063 --> 12:45.731
WHAT IS THIS SHIT ?

12:45.798 --> 12:48.267
I HIRE PEOPLE, THEY GET KILLED,
THEY DISAPPEAR.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.703
FIND OUT WHAT MY HOROSCOPE IS
FOR THIS MONTH.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.975

12:56.041 --> 12:57.643
( man )
SON-OF-A-BITCH !

12:57.710 --> 13:00.146
( Spawn )
THAT HE WAS.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.854
BUT THEN AGAIN,
SO ARE YOU.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.656
WHAT THE FUCK ?!

13:16.829 --> 13:18.397
WHO ARE<i> YOU</i> ?

13:18.464 --> 13:19.698
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

13:19.765 --> 13:21.967
ANYTHING,
ANYTHING AT ALL.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.670
I WANT YOU TO STAY
OUT OF THE ALLEYS, TONY.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.606
YOUR BUSINESS THERE
IS DONE, UNDERSTAND ?

13:27.673 --> 13:30.876
WHATEVER WILD HAIR YOU HAD
UP YOUR ASS ABOUT THAT PLACE

13:30.943 --> 13:33.579
IS OFFICIALLY<i> PLUCKED.</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:34.613
YOU-- !

13:34.680 --> 13:36.615
YOU DESTROYED
MY MEN !

13:36.682 --> 13:38.984
I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.653
THEY WERE DOING
BAD THINGS.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.454
BUT RELAX,

13:42.521 --> 13:44.156
I'M THROUGH
KILLING YOUR MEN.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.090
NEXT TIME,

13:45.157 --> 13:47.726
IF I SEE ONE OF YOUR
BRAIN-DEAD THUGS

13:47.793 --> 13:50.563
SO MUCH AS SPIT IN
THE DIRECTION OF THOSE ALLEYS,

13:50.629 --> 13:52.865
I'M GONNA COME BACK AND
PAY YOU A VISIT, TONY,

13:52.932 --> 13:54.633
AND BELIEVE ME

13:54.700 --> 13:56.669
IT WON'T BE
AS PLEASANT

13:56.735 --> 13:59.805
AS THE VISIT I PAID
YOUR HIRED CYBORG.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.008
SO HERE'S
HOW IT GOES.

14:03.075 --> 14:05.077
AS OF NOW
YOU WORK FOR<i> ME</i>

14:05.144 --> 14:07.580
AND YOUR JOB
IS VERY SIMPLE.

14:07.646 --> 14:10.983
GIVE ME MY SPACE,
UNDERSTAND ?

14:11.050 --> 14:14.019
ALL I WANT IS
A LITTLE PEACE AND QUIET.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.921
GOT IT, FAT BOY ?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.056
YES.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.357
SAY IT.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.226
I WORK FOR YOU.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.695
AND YOU WANT
PEACE AND QUIET.

14:22.761 --> 14:24.196
AND WHO AM I ?

14:24.263 --> 14:25.264
I DON'T KNOW.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.599
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.168
YOU<i> DON'T</i> KNOW.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.905
LET THAT LITTLE MYSTERY
KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.784
FUCK... !

14:52.424 --> 14:54.760
FACED WITH
THE STARK REALITY

14:54.827 --> 14:57.696
THAT<i> EVERY</i> BATTLE
CAN'T BE WON,

14:57.763 --> 15:02.101
THE HELL SPAWNS THEN CRAVE
AN EMOTIONAL REFUGE

15:02.167 --> 15:05.237
TO SOOTHE
THEIR<i> PHYSICAL</i> PAIN.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.679

15:15.414 --> 15:16.682
'MORNING.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.589
'MORNING, DONNA,
MESSAGES ?

15:27.893 --> 15:29.762
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.309
NOW, GIVE ME
THE BAD NEWS.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.978
TWO DEPOSITIONS
OUT OF RIKERS

15:46.045 --> 15:47.880
ON YOUR
PRO BONO ROTATION.

15:47.946 --> 15:51.183
<i> ONE</i> IS
KYLE WATSON.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.152
SORRY, I COULDN'T
PUT IT OFF.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.486
IT'S OKAY.

15:54.553 --> 15:57.556
EVEN AN ACCUSED CHILD KILLER
NEEDS A GOOD DEFENSE, RIGHT ?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.024
NOT<i> TOO</i> GOOD.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.859
THIS GUY'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A REAL<i> MONSTER.</i>

16:00.926 --> 16:03.562
THEY FOUND THE LAST THREE GIRLS
WITHOUT ANY FINGERS AND--

16:03.629 --> 16:05.197
OH, WANDA.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.532
FORGET IT.

16:06.598 --> 16:08.667
THIS WHOLE THING
JUST BOTHERS ME.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.636
ANYWAY, WHEN'S
MY NEXT ONE ?

16:10.703 --> 16:11.637
3:30.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.672
SEE IF YOU CAN
MOVE THAT ONE TO COUNTY.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.673
OKAY.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.743
DON'T YOU JUST<i> LOVE</i>
PRO BONO WORK ?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.811
FUNNY.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.546
GET OUT.

16:32.224 --> 16:33.759
( door unlocking )

16:56.415 --> 16:59.017
ALRIGHT, MR. WATSON,
MY NAME IS WANDA BLAKE

16:59.084 --> 17:01.420
AND I'LL BE TAKING OVER
YOUR DEFENSE.

17:01.487 --> 17:03.088
WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME
GENERAL INFORMATION

17:03.155 --> 17:04.623
DURING THESE PROCEEDINGS

17:04.690 --> 17:06.692
AND I'LL BE RECORDING THIS
AS WE GO ALONG.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.595
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SLOW IT DOWN FOR<i> HIM,</i> MA'AM.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.663
YOU SEE, KYLE HERE'S
A BIT SLOW.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.500
HIS DADDY USED TO BEAT HIM
SOMETHING AWFUL.

17:14.566 --> 17:17.102
AND THE DOCTORS SAY
THAT IT DID SOMETHING

17:17.169 --> 17:20.038
TO HIS SNAPS
AND WHAT NOT.

17:20.105 --> 17:23.742
BUT HE DOES UNDERSTAND
WHY HE'S HERE ?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.744
I DIDN'T
DO NOTHING.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.346
I'VE BEEN
A GOOD BOY.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.914
I'VE BEEN VERY GOOD.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.382
KYLE,

17:30.449 --> 17:32.751
YOU'RE ACCUSED OF
MURDERING EIGHT CHILDREN.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.587
YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF DEVIANT
AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.

17:35.654 --> 17:36.655
WELL...

17:36.722 --> 17:39.258
THAT'S ALL OVER AND
DONE WITH, MA'AM.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.361
KYLE'S BEEN ON HIS MEDICINE NOW
FOR TWO AND ONE HALF YEARS.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.796
I'VE BEEN
A GOOD BOY.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.697
I DON'T HURT NOBODY
NO MORE.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.499
I CAN'T
AND I WON'T.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.668
I GOT PILLS NOW
EVERYDAY.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.603
ACCORDING TO
HIS MEDICAL RECORDS,

17:51.670 --> 17:54.406
THE PILLS ARE CASTRATORS,
THEY KEEP HIM IMPOTENT.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.742
I CAN'T DIDDLE MYSELF
NO MORE OR<i> NOTHING.</i>

17:56.809 --> 17:58.911
I'M A GOOD BOY.

17:58.977 --> 18:02.381
KYLE, YOU WERE GIVEN
A TOXICOLOGY TEST

18:02.448 --> 18:04.616
WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED,
CORRECT ?

18:04.683 --> 18:07.186
THE POLICE TESTED YOU
FOR DRUGS ?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.654
UH-HUH.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.756
I'M NO DOCTOR BUT
BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD,

18:10.823 --> 18:13.091
THIS CASTRATOR DRUG
HAS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

18:13.158 --> 18:14.860
AND TAKES
UP TO TWO MONTHS

18:14.927 --> 18:17.229
TO WORK IT'S WAY
OUT OF THE USER'S SYSTEM.

18:17.296 --> 18:18.797
WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING ?

18:18.864 --> 18:21.867
LOOKING AT THE CRIME LAB
REPORTS ON THE CHILDREN,

18:21.934 --> 18:25.637
THEY WERE ALL
<i>SEXUALLY</i> ASSAULTED.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.974
THEN AGAIN THE POLICE
FOUND CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE

18:29.041 --> 18:31.643
IN KYLE'S ROOM,
ON HIS CLOTHES, IN HIS CAR.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.946
BLOOD AND TISSUE MATCHES,
SEMEN MATCHES,

18:34.012 --> 18:35.814
DNA PRELIMS
ARE POSITIVE.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.716
WITH THIS SOLID
A CASE AGAINST KYLE

18:37.783 --> 18:40.752
THE BEST I CAN DO IS TRY TO
KEEP HIM OFF DEATH ROW.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.255
DON'T LET 'EM
KILL MY BABY,

18:43.322 --> 18:44.790
PLEASE, MA'AM.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.825
I ONLY DONE
LOST MY HUSBAND

18:46.892 --> 18:48.727
AND MY LITTLE GIRL.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.364
POOR KYLE HERE
IS ALL I GOT LEFT !

18:54.500 --> 18:55.400
KYLE...

18:56.301 --> 18:58.103
LOOK AT ME.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.973
DID YOU HURT
ANY OF THOSE CHILDREN ?

19:01.039 --> 19:03.809
I DON'T
HURT NOBODY.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.645
I'M A GOOD BOY.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.116
( reporter )
The media spokesperson

19:11.183 --> 19:13.385
for the New York City
Police Department

19:13.452 --> 19:15.988
had no comment concerning
the upswing in violence

19:16.054 --> 19:19.591
in a specific low income area
of lower Manhattan.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.095
As to possibly reopen the
Kyle Watson child killer case

19:23.161 --> 19:24.930
in light of
what was termed

19:24.997 --> 19:26.832
"a blatant oversight
by the police",

19:26.899 --> 19:28.667
defense attorney
Wanda Blake

19:28.734 --> 19:31.069
is responsible for
this latest revelation.

19:31.136 --> 19:34.273
IF I SEE THAT NEWS FOOTAGE
ONE MORE TIME--

19:34.339 --> 19:36.742
( man )
BUT YOU LOOK SO GOOD.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.294
SOMEONE BURIED THAT
TOXICOLOGY REPORT ON PURPOSE,

19:55.360 --> 19:56.929
PLANTED EVIDENCE.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.264
I JUST HOPE I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.632
DON'T WORRY.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.201
IF YOU SCREW UP,
WE CAN ALWAYS MOVE.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.671
STOP IT, YOU !

20:06.038 --> 20:08.507
WHEN ARE YOU
COMING TO BED ?

20:08.574 --> 20:10.809
AS SOON AS I
SOLVE THIS PUZZLE.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.843
WHAT IS IT ?

20:11.910 --> 20:13.679
MONTHLY
HOUSEKEEPING CHECK

20:13.745 --> 20:15.614
OF CIA ORDNANCE
CATALOGS.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.316
CODE NUMBERS
DON'T MATCH.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.017
IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.353
WANNA KNOW
WHAT MAKES SENSE ?

20:21.420 --> 20:22.220
WHAT ?

20:23.121 --> 20:25.257
I'LL HAVE
TO SHOW YOU.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.002
( Spawn )
I LOVE YOU, WANDA.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.242
( dance music )

20:46.712 --> 20:49.047
( men cheering )

21:25.050 --> 21:26.018
( beeper )

21:45.337 --> 21:46.805
( phone ringing )

21:53.578 --> 21:54.413
YEAH.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.016
HAVING A GOOD TIME,
I TRUST ?

21:58.083 --> 21:59.951
( man )
Yeah, whatever.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.688
YOU REALLY SHOULD
LEARN HOW TO RELAX.

22:02.754 --> 22:04.890
Blood helps me relax.

22:04.956 --> 22:07.359
Got any for me ?

22:07.959 --> 22:11.029
A weapon shipment
going to North Korea.

22:11.096 --> 22:14.166
You accompany
with our compliments.

22:14.232 --> 22:15.667
AND ?

22:15.734 --> 22:18.036
Wait nine hours,

22:18.103 --> 22:20.105
then obliterate
the shipment.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.940
And give them
a bloody nose.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.875
Who takes the fall ?

22:23.942 --> 22:25.777
PERUVIAN TERRORISTS.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.714
After that I'll have something
for you closer to home.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.916
WHEN'S THE HOP ?

22:30.982 --> 22:32.751
TOMORROW MORNING.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.820
USUAL PICK UP
AND DELIVERY.

22:34.886 --> 22:36.955
WHAT ?

22:37.022 --> 22:39.858
I DON'T LIKE A LOT OF
DOWN TIME, YOU<i> KNOW</i> THAT.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.094
SO GET A<i> HOBBY.</i>

22:48.767 --> 22:50.936

22:51.002 --> 22:53.205

C'MON, BABY !

23:01.213 --> 23:03.148

23:07.285 --> 23:08.754
HEY, ASSHOLE.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.456

A FUCKING PROBLEM ?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.293
AAH !

23:18.964 --> 23:20.932
( woman moaning )

23:25.237 --> 23:27.072
( loud grunting )

23:44.523 --> 23:46.124
( man )
NO, AL.

23:47.692 --> 23:49.127
HEY, CHAPEL,

23:49.194 --> 23:51.196
WE'RE PARTNERS,

23:54.599 --> 23:55.700

24:06.778 --> 24:08.713
( DJ )
And in local news,

24:08.780 --> 24:10.715
it looks like
police are gonna

24:10.782 --> 24:12.984
cut ild killer Kyle Watson
loose after all.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.086
Thanks to his attorney,
Wanda Blake,

24:15.153 --> 24:16.855
independent investigators
have found

24:16.922 --> 24:19.624
that evidence in the case may
actually have been planted.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.726
Wow, somebody
check and see

24:21.793 --> 24:24.696
if those cops ever worked
for the L.A.P.D.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.031
Okay,

24:26.097 --> 24:30.001
and now back to our
all big band sounds.
