WEBVTT

00:06.397 --> 00:08.138
- And lastly, we're launching
curbside pickup today,

00:08.182 --> 00:11.054
so some of you are gonna
be working on that with Dina.

00:11.098 --> 00:13.752
- Okay, those on curbside
with me are Simms,

00:13.796 --> 00:16.146
McNeill, Thompson,
Sikowicz, Vasquez,

00:16.190 --> 00:17.669
Bradley, Kaluiokalani.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.758
- So you hired a whole
outside team for this?

00:19.802 --> 00:21.499
- Those are our last names.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.240
- We have a Sikowicz?
- That's me.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.633
- Wait, do you know
Ricky Sikowicz?

00:24.676 --> 00:26.330
- He's my cousin.
- What?

00:26.374 --> 00:27.636
- Mm-hmm.
- He's my cousin too.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.855
- What?
- Oh.

00:29.899 --> 00:33.337
We should probably
stop doing stuff.

00:33.381 --> 00:36.297
- Oh, yeah.
I was gonna say that too.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.126
- Hey, if any of you curbside
folks want to trade places,

00:39.169 --> 00:40.823
I'd be happy
to work outside today.

00:40.866 --> 00:42.564
It's a nice fall day out there.

00:42.607 --> 00:44.479
- Fascinating.
You're inside on checkouts.

00:44.522 --> 00:47.134
- That's fine because
it's fall inside too.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.526
- Not true.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.572
- This is a great debate
for another time.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.400
Now, I'm gonna be
a little busy.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.879
My brother moved back
and I'm giving him

00:53.923 --> 00:55.533
a tour of the store.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.492
- We give tours?
I want to take a tour.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.363
- You work here.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.278
- Yeah, but I don't know
all the history and crap.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.541
- Neither do I.
I'm not gonna tell him history.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.500
- That sounds like
a great tour.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.415
- I didn't know
your brother moved back.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.851
- Yep, he's back,

01:08.894 --> 01:11.158
and he's living with us,
just for a few days.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.551
Or at least in my mind,
it's already been 17.

01:13.595 --> 01:14.726
- Having Eric around rules.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.467
He's the coolest.
We're buds.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.427
It just happened, very organic.
Nothing forced.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.907
- Sounds like it.
- Eric Sosa.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.345
He sounds hot.
- He's gay, Justine.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.609
I mean, not that gay men
can't be hot, obviously.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.393
- Gross, Amy.
He's your brother.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.568
- Yeah.

01:35.486 --> 01:36.748
- So when a curbside order
comes in,

01:36.792 --> 01:38.228
it prints on this printer

01:38.272 --> 01:40.143
and you'll hear
a beep-beep on your Zebra.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.318
Now, you'll grab
the order slip,

01:41.362 --> 01:42.580
collect everything
on that order,

01:42.624 --> 01:44.582
and bring it out
to the customer.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.410
- And we're supposed
to get a two-way thumbs-up?

01:46.454 --> 01:48.282
Is that even possible?
- Apparently so.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.848
I mean,
there's photographic proof.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.763
Now, from the time
you hear the beep-beep,

01:51.807 --> 01:53.548
you'll have 30 minutes
to get the order in the car.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.419
- Yeah, but some orders
take longer, right?

01:55.463 --> 01:57.247
I mean, like,
if it's a big order,

01:57.291 --> 01:58.509
if it's spread out
around the store--

01:58.553 --> 01:59.902
- Yeah, or if it's
for something

01:59.945 --> 02:02.209
that we don't even sell,
like tractors.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.949
- Okay, these sound
like excuses to me.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.474
We've promised 30 minutes.
We'll do it in 30 minutes.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.606
Cloud 9 wants to provide
its lazy customers

02:08.650 --> 02:10.434
with an efficient
shopping experience.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.567
- Yeah, by running
its employees into the ground.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.482
Pretty soon, people are gonna
have to pee in bottles.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.614
'cause they don't have enough
time to take a bathroom break.

02:16.658 --> 02:17.876
- You want to pee in bottles?
No problem.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.226
I'll fish one out
of the recycling.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.705
- No, that's not--

02:20.749 --> 02:22.446
- I mean, it's a little
trickier for the gals,

02:22.490 --> 02:24.709
but definitely doable.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.624
- ♪ I walk in

She's mad at you.

02:34.719 --> 02:35.807
- Why?

02:35.851 --> 02:36.852
- She came over and didn't see

02:36.895 --> 02:38.201
the donkey bookends

02:38.245 --> 02:39.811
she gave you for your birthday.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.249
- Eric, I told you, you can't
just let anybody into my house.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.468
- It's our mother.
- Yeah, that makes it worse.

02:44.512 --> 02:45.817
I have a whole box
full of donkey stuff

02:45.861 --> 02:47.210
I have to put out
when she comes over.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.820
- You know how she works.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.996
You play a donkey in one
nativity scene when you're six

02:51.040 --> 02:52.607
and now it's your thing
forever.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.913
- I was a really good donkey.
- You were.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.741
- Hey, Amy, have you heard back
about that shelf request?

02:56.785 --> 02:59.744
Dan wants to put in a "famous
glasses in history" display.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.311
- It's still a no.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.661
Um, oh, uh, Mateo,
this is my brother Eric.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.663
- Hey.
Nice lab coat.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.970
You work in the... lab?

03:08.013 --> 03:09.493
You guys have a lab here?

03:09.537 --> 03:12.496
- No.
- I work in the vision center.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.368
That's why there's
a creepy eye on here...

03:14.411 --> 03:16.283

Got you.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.028
- Cool.
Great.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.640
It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.253
Don't.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.344
- Hey, Sandra,
this order just says "pot."

03:34.388 --> 03:36.433
Do you know if they mean,
like, nonstick

03:36.477 --> 03:38.870
or cast-iron or maybe they just
think this is a dispensary?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.437
- Oh, I'm the wrong person
to ask.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.657
I don't do a lot of cooking
or drugs.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.572
- Yo, is this
an Oculus Quest headset?

03:44.615 --> 03:47.575
Man, these are,
like, $400 a pop.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.316
Supposed to be amazing VR.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.013

is high-end.

Oh, the cardboard
feels like velvet.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.278

03:56.932 --> 03:58.890
- It's really smooth.
- Yeah.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.936
- Reminds me why we got
into this business, you know?

04:03.591 --> 04:05.941
- Amy, are you creeping
on your brother?

04:05.984 --> 04:07.551
- Shh!
- You're obsessed.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.379
- No, no,
I-I-I sent him over there

04:09.423 --> 04:11.381
to talk to Mateo
about sunglasses

04:11.425 --> 04:12.643
'cause when they met earlier,

04:12.687 --> 04:14.645
Eric got all cute and awkward.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.038
- Okay, you're not obsessed,

04:16.081 --> 04:17.474
but you just called
your brother cute.

04:17.518 --> 04:18.954
- No, I'm saying he likes Mateo

04:18.997 --> 04:20.608
and I thought they could
go on a date.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.566
I mean, it'd be great
for both of them--

04:22.610 --> 04:24.742

dating right now.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.470

07:07.514 --> 07:09.603
It's like he'll go out
with literally anybody.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.256
- Are you serious?

07:11.300 --> 07:14.651
So, what, my brother's
just not good enough for him?

07:14.695 --> 07:16.784
Eric is a frickin' cutie.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.743
He has a cutie patootie.

07:19.787 --> 07:20.918
It's a hot family.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.442

07:27.534 --> 07:28.709
- So you're not
really dating now?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.537
Because Marcus seems
to think you are.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.060
- This.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.322
This is why I don't
shop online.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.411
Who's Marcus?
Let's get into it.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.934
- Can you excuse us, please?

07:39.981 --> 07:42.026
- Okay, fine, I lied.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.593
He was cute, sure, but, okay,

07:43.637 --> 07:46.074
would it kill him to find
a T-shirt without paint on it?

07:46.117 --> 07:47.554
- He does set design.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.251
- If I started
dating your brother,

07:49.294 --> 07:50.513
you know you'd always
be up in our business.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.036
- Oh, come on,
if you started dating,

07:52.080 --> 07:53.734
I would be, like, hands-off.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.518
I mean, like,
I'd be hands-off,

07:55.562 --> 07:57.389
not that I would tell you,
"Keep your hands off."

07:57.433 --> 07:58.739
You could have your hands
all over him.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.088
I wouldn't mind.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.524
I mean,
as long as he consented.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.265
- I don't consent
to this conversation.

08:03.308 --> 08:06.268
- Look, all I'm saying is that
you don't have to worry

08:06.311 --> 08:08.096
about the "me" part of this.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.707
I would be, like, so chill!

08:10.751 --> 08:13.275
Like, you're gonna be like,
"Where's Amy?

08:13.318 --> 08:14.668
I wonder what her
whole take on this is,"

08:14.711 --> 08:16.104
and I'm gonna be, like,

08:16.147 --> 08:19.063
in a hammock,
swinging and chilling.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.631
- Yeah, so that--
I'd be worried about that.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.546
- Hmm.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.070
- Okay, come on, let's go!
These orders are piling up.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.159
Jonah, your last order
took 33 minutes.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.987
Quick math lesson:
That's more than 30.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.598
- Dina, some of these orders
are insane.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.991
One of them just said,
"Retirement gift for my dad.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.253
Don't be afraid
to get creative."

08:35.297 --> 08:37.081
- Yeah, it's been so crazy,

08:37.125 --> 08:39.083
I haven't even been able
to go on Instagram.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.172
Corona thought I was dead.
- We need more help.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.304
Fine.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.307
Be babies.
Sturgis, you're in.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.309
- Glenn Sturgis?

08:47.352 --> 08:48.571
On curbside pickup?

08:48.615 --> 08:50.312
- No, you're gonna
stand outside

08:50.355 --> 08:52.227
and apologize to customers
when these two can't hack it.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.620
- What?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.143
- So my job is to stand outside

08:55.186 --> 08:57.537
on a crisp fall day
and apologize?

08:57.580 --> 09:01.323
These are all
my favorite things!

09:01.366 --> 09:03.630
I am so sorry.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.155
- Glenn apologizing
is not gonna fix

09:07.198 --> 09:08.548
the actual problem here.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.288
- Yeah, well, he's too feeble
to fill orders,

09:10.332 --> 09:12.029
and when people see him
stumbling around out there,

09:12.073 --> 09:13.335
they'll feel bad
and cut us a break.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.163
- No, that sounds
like a big job.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.252
I should probably switch
to apologizing too.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.775
- No! Stop whining!

09:18.819 --> 09:20.734
What I need from the two of you
is less of this

09:20.777 --> 09:22.300
and more of this.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.391
- I...

09:27.479 --> 09:28.524
Okay, are you gonna actually

09:28.568 --> 09:29.525
mime the whole thing?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.744
- Wow, she's good at that.

09:30.787 --> 09:34.051
Next game night,
she's on my team.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.357
- Garrett, guess what?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.837
We sold another
one of those VRs.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.578
- What?
No way!

09:38.621 --> 09:39.840
Hold up.

09:39.883 --> 09:42.277
Barbecue chips?
Takis?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.801
Dill pickle-flavored almonds?

09:44.845 --> 09:46.629
This dude gets it.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.676
- You should meet him.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.461
- Oh, my God.
This was Jerry's order?

09:52.504 --> 09:54.724
- Yep, I'm sure
you had no idea.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.421
- Hey, sweetie.
Hey, Garrett.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.423
I'm here to pick up
my video game.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.686
- Your video game?

09:59.729 --> 10:01.601
Do you have any idea
what you just bought?

10:01.644 --> 10:04.081
That's state-of-the-art
wireless VR.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.475
- Cool.
I learn so much from you.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.824
- Hey, Garrett,

10:07.868 --> 10:09.478
maybe you could help Jerry
set this up,

10:09.521 --> 10:11.436
and then if you wanted
to play for a while,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.874
I'd cover you and you could
get to know each other better.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.137
You know,
since you're his best man.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.442
That all just occurred to me.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.232
- You know,
I've left work for less.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.450
Let's go.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.278
- I mean, sure,
curbside is quiet now,

10:27.322 --> 10:28.715
but the morning rush
was insane,

10:28.758 --> 10:29.890
and for 9:00 a.m.,

10:29.933 --> 10:31.282
a lot of our customers
are drunk.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.720
Is it, like,
World Cup or something?

10:33.763 --> 10:35.678
Amy?

10:35.722 --> 10:37.637
- Mateo and Eric,

10:37.680 --> 10:40.248
they would be good
together, right?

10:40.291 --> 10:42.816
- Not my first choice,
but sure.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.469
- Look, Eric's gotta
get out of the house.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.732
He needs a social life.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.429
I-I want him to meet
a nice guy,

10:47.472 --> 10:51.607
and Mateo's nice,
sometimes, in a way.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.609
- So then what's the problem?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.264
- Well, Mateo is afraid
that I'm gonna be too involved,

10:56.307 --> 10:57.918
so he won't even
give Eric a shot.

10:57.961 --> 11:00.224
I think I'm gonna have to give
them a little bit of a push.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.487
- To show that you wouldn't
be too involved?

11:02.531 --> 11:04.446
- No, I'm gonna
get involved now

11:04.489 --> 11:05.534
just to get the ball rolling.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.841
- Right.
Got it.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.713
- Hi.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.280
I know you've been out here
for a while,

11:12.323 --> 11:13.629
so behalf of Cloud 9,

11:13.673 --> 11:16.458
I would like to apologize.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.765
- Where's my order?
I need that washing machine.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.897
- Okay, I'm not
on order fulfillment.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.638
I'm on apologies.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.858
- Why'd they send you all
the way out here to apologize

11:24.901 --> 11:26.903
when you could have just
brought me my stuff?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.209
- Oh, don't worry, sir.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.601
Your order will be right out.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.821
We've got our best
team members on it.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.257
- ♪ All of her lovers

11:33.301 --> 11:34.868
♪ All talk of her notes

11:34.911 --> 11:38.741
♪ And the flowers
that they never sent ♪

11:38.785 --> 11:43.920
♪ And wasn't she

11:43.964 --> 11:46.706
- We don't really have
many guests.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.403
Oh, do you want a snow cone?

11:48.446 --> 11:51.319
- A snow cone?
No, I'm--I'm good.

11:51.362 --> 11:52.668
Thank you.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.846
You guys big Guy Fieri fans?
- Who?

11:56.890 --> 11:59.544
Oh, we got that at a yard sale.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.677
We liked his confidence.
- Mm.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.548
Well, why don't we break
into this little bad boy

12:03.592 --> 12:06.813
and download some games?

12:06.856 --> 12:08.728
- Do you think you'll want
a snow cone later?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.338
'Cause the machine's in storage

12:10.381 --> 12:11.774
and I'd have to wait
for the water to freeze

12:11.818 --> 12:13.297
and we'd need to get
a jump on it.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.559
- Yeah, you know what,
Jerry, I'm--

12:14.603 --> 12:16.518
I'm all good on snow cones.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.738
- Okay. We don't have any
of the flavored syrup anyway.

12:18.781 --> 12:21.915
- Okay, so just
crushed ice in a cone.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.699
- ♪ You want to say

12:23.743 --> 12:27.355
♪ And let the words fall out

12:27.398 --> 12:30.575
♪ Honestly,
I want to see you ♪

12:30.619 --> 12:32.839
- Oh, here you are.
Both of you.

12:32.882 --> 12:35.493
- Yep, I'm just having Eric
install some shelves.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.365
He put some shelves
in our mother's bathroom

12:37.408 --> 12:40.716
and they looked... really cool.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.718
- I thought you said Cloud 9
didn't approve these.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.851
- I don't think that's what
I said at all.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.678
Anyway, uh, new shelves,
new possibilities,

12:46.722 --> 12:48.245
new connections.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.857
So with that,
I will leave you to... it.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.859
I will leave you to it.
Good-bye.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.864
- Excuse me.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.866
I order three jars of pumpkin
spice salsa an hour ago,

12:59.909 --> 13:01.519
and I've been waiting
in my car.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.825
- Are you sure?

13:02.869 --> 13:04.740
'Cause we filled
all the orders that came in.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.307
- Obviously you didn't,

13:06.350 --> 13:08.352
because I don't have
my pumpkin spice salsa.

13:08.396 --> 13:11.442
- Yeah, I'm sorry,
but there's no order here.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.880
- Well, I guess I'll go get my
pumpkin spice salsa by myself,

13:13.923 --> 13:15.403
like it's 1950.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.885
- What order was that guy
talking about?

13:18.928 --> 13:20.451
Did it fall somewhere?

13:20.495 --> 13:21.583
- Yeah, I don't know.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.498
He sounded like a liar to me.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.673
Just ignore him, you know?

13:24.716 --> 13:26.370
- Is the printer
out of paper or--

13:26.414 --> 13:28.416
- Wait--
- It's unplugged.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.418
- Okay, it was me, all right?
I unplugged it!

13:30.461 --> 13:32.594
I couldn't take
the beeping noise anymore!

13:32.637 --> 13:33.856
- So the orders
are still coming in?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.423
We're just not being notified?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.077
- Yeah.
Isn't it so much better?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.469
No, Jonah, no!

13:38.513 --> 13:39.862
The plug is what
gives it power!

13:44.736 --> 13:46.303
Should we just quit our jobs?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.305
I mean, I'm in if you are.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.052
- Can everyone
in this row hear me?

13:56.096 --> 13:58.794
'Cause I'd like to apologize
and offer you all

13:58.838 --> 14:02.885
a nice, hot cup of cider
to enjoy while you wait!

14:02.929 --> 14:04.408
- Is it too late to quit?

14:04.452 --> 14:06.062
I mean, I'm still in if--
- No, no, no, no.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.891
Look, Dina, there was
a minor printer glitch

14:08.935 --> 14:10.371
that set us behind,

14:10.414 --> 14:12.242
but--but I promise
we are gonna do our best

14:12.286 --> 14:14.331
to get back on track.
- Your best?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.159
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.379
Otherwise, this program
is gonna get shut down,

14:18.422 --> 14:20.076
all because
you couldn't hack it.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.948
You two are a lazy waste
of feet.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.471
- Okay, you know what, Dina?

14:23.514 --> 14:25.125
You've just been barking orders
at us all day,

14:25.168 --> 14:26.474
and if you were actually
doing the work,

14:26.517 --> 14:28.128
you would see how hard it is.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.346
- Oh, you think
this is hard work?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.000
I could do this all by myself.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.046
In fact, that's what I will do.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.004
Time me.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.485
- Okay, great.
Let's see how you do.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.532
I shine
under high-pressure situations.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.143
This is 2003's regionals

14:43.186 --> 14:45.493
for Missouri's Best Bagger
all over again.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.538
- I guess we'll see.
You ready?

14:47.582 --> 14:48.539
- Wait.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.157
Okay.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.034
- Watching your brother
work, huh?

15:05.078 --> 15:06.470
I heard you had
a thing for him.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.646
- I do not have a thing
for my brother.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.954
I'm just checking to see if he
and Mateo are hitting it off.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.522
Come on, you losers.
Somebody say something.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.219
Hit it off.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.308
- Maybe you should
give them some space.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.136
- I'm all the way over here.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.616
How much space do they need?

15:21.659 --> 15:23.400
- Yeah.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.143
- Okay.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.666
Hey, Eric!

15:28.710 --> 15:31.539
I just thought I'd swing by,
see how things are going.

15:31.582 --> 15:32.975
- Well, I hung one bracket,

15:33.019 --> 15:34.498
but there's only
three screws left.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.978
- Yeah, yeah, you're good.
You got this.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.284
You know what I was
thinking about?

15:37.327 --> 15:38.415
Remember that story you told me
about when

15:38.459 --> 15:39.503
you were in
the Phoenix airport?

15:39.547 --> 15:40.983
Oh, sorry, uh, Mateo,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.158
are we talking too loud
for you?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.594
- You're fine.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.466
- Okay, great.
Um, you were saying?

15:45.509 --> 15:47.555
- Well, I was talking
about shelves.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.513
- No, but you were about
to tell me that funny story,

15:49.557 --> 15:52.516
about how when you were
in the Phoenix airport,

15:52.560 --> 15:54.083
you saw Anna Wintour.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.519
Yeah.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.348
Anna Wintour flew commercial
to Phoenix?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.046
- Yeah, no, I-I thought
it was her,

16:00.089 --> 16:02.135
but it just ended up being
some old white lady

16:02.178 --> 16:04.224
with big sunglasses
and a bowl cut.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.704
She was actually kinda racist.
She asked me to carry her bags.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.185
That is so funny.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.361
You are so funny!
I just--

16:11.405 --> 16:14.669
I wish I could go to dinner
with you and just, like,

16:14.712 --> 16:18.368
hear your stories and laugh
and drink and laugh,

16:18.412 --> 16:20.414
and I'm not mad
at the view either.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.721
You know what I'm saying?
- Amy, stop.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.293
- 12 minutes to go.
- I can do it in 11:45.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.166
- Uh, sorry.
I just got another one.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.124
- This side was feeling
light anyway.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.301
- Wow.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.520
- Do you feel guilty
about this?

16:39.563 --> 16:42.958
- Nope.
- Me neither.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.394
- Oh, what do you see now?

16:44.438 --> 16:46.266
Is it a dragon?
I bet it is.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.397
- I told you,

16:47.441 --> 16:48.572
there's no dragons
in this game.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.270
Why don't you put on
the headset

16:50.313 --> 16:52.402
and then you can see and you
don't have to ask questions?

16:52.446 --> 16:54.361
- You mean... play together?

16:54.404 --> 16:56.972
- More like play the same game
at the same time.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.413
- Whoa.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.286
It's so dark, it really feels
like I'm in outer space.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.418
- You have to
turn it on, Jerry.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.425
- All right!

17:15.469 --> 17:17.688
The next five cars,
pull forward!

17:17.732 --> 17:20.126
Ford, Chrysler, that means you!

17:20.169 --> 17:21.431
By the way,

17:21.475 --> 17:23.694
I appreciate
that you bought American!

17:23.738 --> 17:27.742
- Wow, six orders at once.
This is impressive/terrifying.

17:27.785 --> 17:31.093
- Wow, maybe we are
a waste of feet.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.139
- Aww, traffic's moving.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.272
Now what am I supposed to do
with these apology apples?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.581
Having fun watching the show?

17:40.624 --> 17:41.582
Can't say I blame you.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.105
I'd be watching me too

17:43.149 --> 17:44.672
if I wasn't the one
doing the work.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.456
- Oh, did they not want
those wine glasses?

17:46.500 --> 17:49.720
- What?
Oh, crap.

17:49.764 --> 17:53.246
- Order for Taylor!
You forgot your stemware!

17:54.638 --> 17:56.423
- Oh!
- Dina!

17:59.861 --> 18:01.602
- Oh, my God, Dina, uh,

18:01.645 --> 18:03.125
we gotta get you
to the hospital.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.648
- Oh, you would just love that,
wouldn't you?

18:04.692 --> 18:05.780
I'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

18:05.823 --> 18:06.781
Ah!

18:06.824 --> 18:08.478
Oh, oh.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.133
Glenn, apologize
to the car I dented.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.482
- Uh, okay.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.615
It's probably two apples for...

18:15.877 --> 18:17.270
- Dina...

18:18.793 --> 18:19.968
This sounds a little damaged.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.143
I should go get a new one.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.231
- No, no, no, no, no.
Stop.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.232
Forget about the order.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.712
You're hurt.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.975
- How much time do I have?

18:27.018 --> 18:29.934
- 90 seconds.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.023
- Oh, actually,
you only have 20--

18:32.067 --> 18:33.764
- Cheyenne, Cheyenne,
she needs this.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.026
- Oh.

18:38.029 --> 18:40.641
- Took some doing,
but these are solid.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.643
I think I'm gonna head out.
- Now?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.035
You're leaving now?
Already?

18:44.079 --> 18:46.081
But, um, we should
probably, you know,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.127
test the shelves,
make sure they, um,

18:48.170 --> 18:50.825
can hold the weight.
- Of eyeglasses?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.654
- Or, you know, whatever else
Mateo decides to put on there.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.177
- It'll probably
just be glasses.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.179
- Oh, look at you two
on the same page.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.615
- Amy, stop.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.182
- I really should check,
you know,

19:00.226 --> 19:02.532
while you're here in the store
and the tools are out,

19:02.576 --> 19:04.665
and--ow,
these are really strong.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.667
- Yeah, you're welcome.
I'll see you tonight.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.625
I've been told we're having
tri-tip many times.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.192
- Oh, hey, Marcus,

19:10.236 --> 19:12.760
will you help me figure out
if these shelves are stable?

19:12.803 --> 19:15.110
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Let's do this.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.810
- Come on!
- Oh, my God!

19:19.854 --> 19:22.204
- Uh, you guys saw.
She made me do this.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.553
This is her fault.
- No!

19:23.597 --> 19:25.120
Not my fault!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.253
Your fault because the two
of you don't know

19:27.296 --> 19:29.211
how to pick up on cues.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.908
Eric, all you had to do
was tell a funny story.

19:30.952 --> 19:33.346
You've got hundreds of them.
Well, dozens, anyway.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.738
And Mateo...

19:34.782 --> 19:36.218
You dated Jeff.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.351
Eric is way hotter than Jeff,

19:38.394 --> 19:40.701
so how about the two
of you just start talking

19:40.744 --> 19:42.050
so that your chill sister
can get back

19:42.093 --> 19:43.878
into her hammock and swing?

19:43.921 --> 19:45.314
- It makes me feel icky
when you call me hot.

19:45.358 --> 19:46.837
- We're a hot family.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.056
Everyone's talking
about it today.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.579
Deal with it.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.756
- Everyone is talking about it.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.802
- Yeah.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.804
- Oh, nice, Jer!

19:56.847 --> 19:58.109
You mostly blew yourself up,

19:58.153 --> 20:00.068
but you distracted
a couple zombies.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.201
- Yes!
High five!

20:02.244 --> 20:03.767
Oh, stabbed you.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.073
- It's all good, man.
I got health.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.249
- All right, here we go.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.686
Cover me.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.080
- Oh! Garrett!
I did it!

20:12.123 --> 20:13.864
I built a barn!

20:13.908 --> 20:15.953
- Uh, yeah, you know,
I think that was already there,

20:15.997 --> 20:17.738
but, uh, good job, buddy.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.088
- Buddy.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.785
- Hey.

20:21.829 --> 20:25.049
I'm, uh, sorry about the mess.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.008
- Please, I should be
thanking you.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.271
This is usually the most boring
corner of the store.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.969
- Not today.
Look, I'm sorry about Amy too.

20:32.013 --> 20:33.841
She means well.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.104
She just tries
too hard sometimes.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.671
- Uh, did you see the top
she was wearing?

20:37.714 --> 20:39.890
She tries too hard
all the time.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.197
- And, hey, if I knew
I was gonna meet someone,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.155
I probably would have
tried harder myself.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.636
- Well, you're lucky.
You pull it off.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.683
- So, um,

20:49.726 --> 20:52.425
you maybe want to
go out sometime?

20:52.468 --> 20:55.297
Like, on a date?
A real date?

20:55.341 --> 20:57.299
- Sure.
- Great.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.739
- Obviously, we can
never tell Amy.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.046
- Oh, God, never.
Yeah.

21:05.089 --> 21:08.179
- Oh, hey, Dina.

21:08.223 --> 21:11.835
- How's curbside going?
- Oh, went great.

21:11.879 --> 21:15.230
- Oh, really?
Oh, well, good.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.753
Corporate wanted to do

21:16.797 --> 21:18.277
a 20-minute guarantee
for Black Friday.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.801
I thought that'd be impossible,
but maybe not.
