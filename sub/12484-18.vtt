San Francisco, the City by the Bay!

00:14.100 --> 00:17.310
Where tonight, we're fishing for
some talent!

00:17.340 --> 00:19.740
Welcome to
<i>America Needs Talent!</i>

00:19.780 --> 00:21.390
I'm your host, Nicky G!

00:21.450 --> 00:26.390
Usually I'm killin' it on the hit reality show:
<i>Yo! I'm from Jerse</i>

00:26.420 --> 00:28.420
But tonight is not about me.

00:28.450 --> 00:31.060
It's about finding generation of talent!

00:31.090 --> 00:36.200
And if anyone because I'm full of it!

00:36.230 --> 00:38.330
They've come from
all over Northern California

00:38.370 --> 00:40.200
to what I think is a high school.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.170
I'm not sure, inside one before.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.170
Oh, I'm so excited!

00:46.210 --> 00:48.280
<i>America Needs Talent</i> <i>is like one of
my top 10</i> <i>favorite TV talent shows!</i>

00:48.310 --> 00:51.240
And Nicky G is in our school!

00:51.280 --> 00:55.380
I never miss,
<i>Yo! I'm from Jersey!</i>

00:55.410 --> 00:59.250
It's so much better than, <i>Hey,
y'all,</i> <i>I'm from Georgia!</i>

00:59.280 --> 01:02.350
And, <i>Check it out!</i>
<i>I'm from Saskatchewan, eh!</i>

01:02.390 --> 01:05.019
The only reality show I watch

01:05.060 --> 01:08.160
is the one where contestants try
to avoid eating poisoned cookies.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.330
<i>Deadliest Batch!</i>

01:11.360 --> 01:15.370
TV is just so good these days.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.300
All these contestants at the auditionsll it

01:18.340 --> 01:22.070
and make it in Hollywood.

01:22.110 --> 01:23.210
Like her.
What's your name?

01:25.240 --> 01:27.110
I, uh... Um.

01:27.450 --> 01:29.110
Nicky G.

01:29.150 --> 01:31.350
Cool!
That's my name, too.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.120
You gonna kill it tonight?

01:33.150 --> 01:34.150
Well, I...

01:34.180 --> 01:36.050
I'm going to kill it!

01:36.090 --> 01:38.420
The name's Lexi, me Lextraordinary.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.150
What?

01:41.190 --> 01:42.020
People call you a lot of things,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.320
but Lextraordinary isn't one of them.

Winning <i>America Needs Talent</i>

02:58.940 --> 03:00.230
You know, I mean, a good dream,

03:00.230 --> 03:02.000
not the one where I open my sock drawer

03:36.100 --> 03:38.300
I inherited this straitjacket
from my grandfather.

03:38.330 --> 03:40.270
Oh, was he an escape artist?

03:40.300 --> 03:42.200
No! He was a danger to
himself and others.

03:44.410 --> 03:47.280
Now, for an amazing escape.

03:53.180 --> 03:56.120

what it would have been like
had I met Marilyn Monroe.

04:10.170 --> 04:12.130
Did someone call my name?

04:15.040 --> 04:20.180
So, Marilyn, what do you
think about physics?

04:22.110 --> 04:26.350
I don't care about men's physiques,

04:32.390 --> 04:35.260

How about I just make you a sandwich?

05:34.420 --> 05:36.390
I really need to go to Hollywood.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.320

<i>America Needs Talent!</i>

06:49.200 --> 06:51.400

06:51.430 --> 06:54.230
I was on TV!

06:54.270 --> 06:56.340
Remember that time I fell down that well?

06:58.370 --> 07:02.310
I had continuous coverage for three days!

07:02.340 --> 07:05.280
One of the dangers of having a

07:07.220 --> 07:10.120
So, anyway, I'm going to LA!

07:10.150 --> 07:12.120
And they gave me two airline tickets.

07:12.150 --> 07:14.290
One for me, one for you.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.160
Uh-uh!
Uh-uh!

07:18.190 --> 07:21.100
Okay, now, look, Dad, I know
you're afraid of flying

07:21.130 --> 07:23.030
but we have to do this.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.330
This is the most important thing

07:24.370 --> 07:27.200
that has ever happened to anyone, ever!

07:27.240 --> 07:31.010
Chyna, you always exaggerate.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.240
You exaggerate like a million times a day.

07:36.050 --> 07:38.210
Okay. Dad, I don't
care what it takes.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.150
I'm getting you over your fear of flying.

07:44.220 --> 07:45.150
Peanuts, sir?

07:48.290 --> 07:50.260
Would you stop kicking my seat?

07:53.330 --> 07:55.300
Don't you talk to my baby that way!

07:58.400 --> 08:01.200
When are we going to get off
of this tin death trap?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.240
This airplane is perfectly safe, sir.

08:03.270 --> 08:04.410
Safe?

08:04.440 --> 08:07.040
The pilot barely finished tenth grade.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.010
And he's steering with a soft pretzel.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.280
Sir, please try to pull it together.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.190
Because I've been informed by the tower

08:18.220 --> 08:20.190
that this is very important
to your daughter.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.990
This is your captain speaking.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.060
We're entering a patch of...

08:25.090 --> 08:26.190
Holy fuselage!

08:26.230 --> 08:29.200
We've lost an engine!
We're going down!

08:36.039 --> 08:39.309
Excuse me, is there a doctor on board?

08:39.340 --> 08:41.070
Preferably a therapist?

08:44.310 --> 08:48.050
Ugh! I can't fit all
my makeup in here.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.220
I need to look my best.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.280
If Chyna beats me, I'll die!

08:51.320 --> 08:54.290
<i>America Needs Talent</i> is
a competition to the death?

08:57.260 --> 08:59.290
These reality shows are
getting out of hand.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.230
Ugh!

09:04.230 --> 09:07.130
Stupid airlines and their two bag limit.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.200
Why don't you just leave your makeup here

09:09.240 --> 09:11.110
and we can buy you new
stuff when we get to LA?

09:11.140 --> 09:12.310
Are you clueless?

09:12.340 --> 09:14.110
No!
I'm just doing a magic act!

09:18.210 --> 09:21.150
I spent years getting the perfect
collection of beauty products

09:21.180 --> 09:23.320
to match my unique skin tone.

09:23.350 --> 09:26.990
Sorry, Paisley.
I'm going to need your bags.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.120
But where will I put my clothes?

09:31.390 --> 09:33.130
All right.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.300
Let's get to the airport.

09:36.060 --> 09:39.230
Paisley, my bags.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.140
Right. Sorry.

09:55.420 --> 09:59.150
See, Chyna? Driving is much
less stressful than flying.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.090
Fletcher!
Would you stop kicking my seat?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.290
We're not playing that game anymore.

10:07.330 --> 10:11.130
I know, but he yelled at me.

10:11.170 --> 10:15.070
Okay, I cannot let Lexi look
better than me on the show.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.270
So which dress should I wear?

10:17.410 --> 10:20.310
This one, or this one?

10:20.340 --> 10:23.110
Chyna, put those down!
I can't see!

10:23.150 --> 10:25.080
Oh, sorry.
And go with the ruby one.

10:25.110 --> 10:26.380
You always look better in jewel tones.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.380
I can't wait to get to LA!

10:28.420 --> 10:31.250
Me, too.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.260
I'm trying to get on that game
show, <i>The Brainy Bunch,</i>

10:33.290 --> 10:39.360
"Where contestants flex their intellectual
muscles and compete for cash prizes!"

10:50.240 --> 10:54.110
I really hope traffic is
light on the freeway.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We can't take the freeway.

10:56.210 --> 10:58.350
We have to drive along the coast

10:58.380 --> 11:01.150
and visit the Danish village of Solvang.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.320
Look, guys, I really just
want to get to LA.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.090
I can't risk being late
for <i>America Needs Talent.</i>

11:11.130 --> 11:12.360
Chyna's right.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.330
And I promised her we wouldn't
make any unnecessary stops.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.070
It says Solvang's local
delicacy is called ebelskivers.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.300
Little fried dough balls.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.400
Fried dough balls?
Scenic road it is!

11:36.120 --> 11:38.420
It's hot in LA!

11:38.450 --> 11:41.260
I'm going to put on these shorts
I bought in the gift shop.

11:52.270 --> 11:54.300
Oh! And what are you
waiting for?

11:54.340 --> 11:55.400
Career advice?

11:55.440 --> 11:57.270
Too late.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.250
Okay, Paisley.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.050
Here's my makeup.
I want it organized alphabetically.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.190
Okay, by color.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.260
But everything in here's green.

12:18.130 --> 12:18.160
What?

12:20.300 --> 12:24.030
Oh, my gosh!

12:24.070 --> 12:25.230
There's like a million dollars in here.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.170
What am I supposed to do without my makeup?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.410
Why does everything bad
always happen to me?

12:38.220 --> 12:41.220
Hey, Chyna, you know what you
should sing on the show?

12:41.250 --> 12:44.050
The stirring national anthem of Slovakia.

12:59.370 --> 13:02.100
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

13:02.140 --> 13:04.410
It would never be as good
as Celine Dion's version.

13:10.210 --> 13:13.050
Dad, why are we stopped here?

13:13.080 --> 13:14.320
The sign says,
"Scenic overlook."

13:14.350 --> 13:17.250
You can't overlook an overlook.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.060
Especially not this time of year.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.160
It's walrus spawning season.

13:21.390 --> 13:22.430
I want to see that.

13:26.070 --> 13:28.130
Well, I don't see any walruses.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.300
Let's go!

13:29.340 --> 13:32.240
Maybe I can ask that portly,
bucktoothed gentleman

13:32.270 --> 13:35.210
if he's seen any walruses.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.240
That is a walrus and he's blocking our way!

13:38.280 --> 13:40.410
Relax.
I'm very good with animals.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.110
Move it, fatty!

13:44.250 --> 13:46.180
I wouldn't do that.

13:46.220 --> 13:49.290
Your horn could be mistaken for the
loud barking noise the males use

13:49.320 --> 13:52.190
to challenge the dominance
of the beach master.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.360
What happens if we
challenge the beach master?

13:54.390 --> 13:56.060
I'm guessing that!

14:11.220 --> 14:14.350
Okay, this is bad.
Really bad.

14:14.380 --> 14:15.440
No kidding.

14:15.470 --> 14:19.530
That walrus is slobbering all over
San Francisco's cleanest cop car!

14:21.550 --> 14:23.580
I wanted to be
on <i>America Needs Talent,</i>

14:23.610 --> 14:25.780
not <i>When Walruses Attack.</i>

14:25.820 --> 14:28.580
Although I would totally watch that show.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.620
The walrus is fighting for male dominance.

14:30.850 --> 14:33.690
He won't relent until he's won
the affections of a female.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.930
Okay, so we just need
to get a female walrus.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.800
Oh. Don't worry.
I know where we can find one.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.840
This is your plan?

14:46.870 --> 14:49.710
What are we supposed to do now?

14:49.740 --> 14:52.710
Well, I guess we just get the
walrus to be attracted to us.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.810
No problem.

14:56.850 --> 14:59.820
Well, hello there, you handsome fellow.

15:00.950 --> 15:03.820
<i>♪ La la la la la la la ♪</i>

15:07.660 --> 15:09.760
You know nothing about flirting.

15:19.700 --> 15:19.740
Run!

15:25.480 --> 15:27.840
I can't get out of this thing!

15:27.900 --> 15:30.030
Can someone give me a hand?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.850
Uh-oh!

15:37.720 --> 15:40.920
Paisley, you've been counting
that money for an hour.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.760
Are you done yet?
Yes.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.760
There is one bag of money.

15:45.730 --> 15:48.700
Yes, yes!
Did you find it?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.830
So, did they find it?

15:54.870 --> 15:56.770
Yes, Paisley.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.740
That's why I threw the phone.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.740
To celebrate that they found my bag.

16:01.810 --> 16:02.740
Yay!

16:10.920 --> 16:12.720
Look, the bell boy must have accidentally

16:12.760 --> 16:14.990
switched it with someone else's bag.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.790
The hotel's no help.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.760
My aunt's at the spa getting a massage.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.800
We're going to have to
look for it ourselves.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.730
In disguise.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.670
A mermaid?

16:31.710 --> 16:34.640
What? You told me to
dress like a maid.

16:34.680 --> 16:35.910
You didn't say what kind.

16:39.780 --> 16:40.720
Just put this on!

16:41.020 --> 16:41.820
Housekeeping!

16:53.800 --> 16:54.970
Cameron, are you okay?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.770
I don't want to talk about it.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.810
Okay, well, he seems fine.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.740
So let's just get in the
car and get back to LA.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.680
Excuse me, folks.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.810
I'm going to need to
ask you a few questions.

17:08.849 --> 17:10.750
Uh, is there a problem, officer?

17:10.780 --> 17:13.790
You weren't, by any chance,

17:13.819 --> 17:16.990
harassing the local wildlife, hmm?

17:17.020 --> 17:19.890
No way! If anything
it was harassing me.

17:19.930 --> 17:25.630
Are you aware that
interacting with a walrus

17:25.670 --> 17:27.800
is illegal in the township of Solvang?

17:31.040 --> 17:33.680
Good sir, you could probably tell this

17:33.710 --> 17:35.810
by my good manners and Nordic features,

17:35.850 --> 17:38.710
but my great-great-grandmother
was Danish.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.750
Mmm-hmm? Looks like it was
all downhill from there.

17:44.820 --> 17:48.660
Okay, look, sir, we are just passing
through on our way to LA...

17:48.690 --> 17:51.660
Right.
"Passing through."

17:51.690 --> 17:54.860
Because Solvang isn't good enough for you.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.930
It doesn't have the bright
lights and the big shows.

17:57.970 --> 18:04.800
Well, I'll have you know that our
local production <i>Thumbelina</i>

18:04.840 --> 18:09.710
was hailed by t <i>Copenhagen Gazette</i>
<i>as</i> <i>"utrolig."</i>

18:09.740 --> 18:12.780
Ooh! Sounds <i>underholdende!</i>

18:12.810 --> 18:14.720
Are tickets still available?

18:14.750 --> 18:17.750
No. And this is the only
ticket you're going to get.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.660
Eight hundred yonkerdoodles?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.830
Is that even a real currency?

18:30.860 --> 18:35.640
It is the official mock
currency of Solvang.

18:35.670 --> 18:36.770
Four yonkerdoodles to a dollar.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.940
Can't we just work this out, cop to cop?

18:42.980 --> 18:45.750
I happen to be a highly decorated member

18:45.780 --> 18:48.750
of the San Francisco police department.

18:48.780 --> 18:53.690
Oh, a big city cop, huh?

18:53.720 --> 18:56.720
You think you can just
come to our small town

18:56.760 --> 19:00.760
and do whatever you want!

19:00.800 --> 19:02.900
Ooh! Are those
ebelskivers?

19:02.930 --> 19:04.670
I've always wanted to try one!

19:04.700 --> 19:08.600
These are popovers!

19:08.640 --> 19:10.610
You think you're funny, huh?

19:10.640 --> 19:13.940
Laughing at that stereotype that
policemen are always eating ebelskivers.

19:13.980 --> 19:18.750
Well, let's see how funny
you find things in "yail!"

19:23.020 --> 19:25.890
And you said there was no
way I'd ever get into Yale.

19:28.690 --> 19:29.660
Please, officer.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.660
While your windmill jail
is charming and quaint,

19:33.700 --> 19:34.860
you have to let us go.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.770
I'm going to be a contestant
on <i>America Needs Talent.</i>

19:37.800 --> 19:40.870
<i>America Needs Talent?</i>
<i>I love that show.</i>

19:40.900 --> 19:42.670
But I keep waiting for them to
bring Danish folk dancers on

19:42.710 --> 19:44.740
and they never do!

19:44.780 --> 19:46.910
That takes real talent!

19:46.940 --> 19:49.950
This is Officer Lars requesting backup.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.070
Where is my money?

20:17.940 --> 20:19.710
This some kind of joke?

20:20.780 --> 20:22.680
This not my money!

20:22.710 --> 20:23.780
Also not match my skin tone.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.860
Housekeeping!

20:33.890 --> 20:35.930
Sign say, "Do not disturb!
" Can you not read?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.900
Nope!

20:39.070 --> 20:43.840
Hey! That's my bag!

20:43.870 --> 20:46.040
And you spilled my bronzer!

20:46.070 --> 20:49.740
You think you can get away
with something like that?

20:54.050 --> 20:59.880
Don't-ever-touch-
my-makeup-again!

21:02.890 --> 21:04.120
Call me if you ever want job.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.060
We have jobs!
We're maids!

21:14.730 --> 21:16.700
What are we going to do?

21:16.740 --> 21:17.870
The show's tonight!

21:17.900 --> 21:19.670
<i>Thumbelina?</i>

21:19.700 --> 21:21.910
Did they add an encore performance?

21:21.940 --> 21:23.840
I'm talking about
<i>America Needs Talent.</i>

21:23.870 --> 21:27.680
Right now, Lexi's probably
in her hotel room,

21:27.710 --> 21:28.980
slapping on her tenth coat of bronzer.

21:29.010 --> 21:31.010
Meanwhile, I'm stuck in windmill jail

21:31.050 --> 21:34.680
with bail set at one million yonkerdoodles!

21:34.720 --> 21:36.150
Look, it's not our fault.

21:36.190 --> 21:39.950
We wouldn't even be in here if that
Danish cop wasn't such a "yerk."

21:39.990 --> 21:43.760
At least he gave me a shirt that
wasn't covered in walrus slobber.

21:43.790 --> 21:44.830
Wait!
That's the windmill we're in.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.930
And it has a window!

21:47.970 --> 21:48.730
I see it.

21:48.770 --> 21:49.830
It's right there.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.770
Stop that!

21:54.940 --> 21:56.770
Hey, that window should be right

21:58.880 --> 21:59.840
on this wall.

22:01.810 --> 22:02.780
It must be behind the poster.

22:08.820 --> 22:09.990
We can't escape through here.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.660
The blades are spinning too quickly.

22:12.690 --> 22:13.620
No problem.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.790
We can just wait until the winds die down.

22:15.830 --> 22:18.930
Which, according to historical
meteorological data,

22:18.960 --> 22:19.660
should happen by November.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.700
December at the latest.

22:21.730 --> 22:22.730
November?

22:22.770 --> 22:23.970
December at the latest.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.970
Hey, where'd Fletcher go?

22:27.010 --> 22:28.810
I'm over here!

22:29.810 --> 22:31.780
No!

22:31.810 --> 22:34.850
The windmill blades must be
creating high suction pressure.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.020
It must've pulled Fletcher out the
window when he was standing over

22:37.050 --> 22:38.920
here!

22:41.920 --> 22:45.790
All right. The next time I have the
chance to win a national talent contest,

22:45.830 --> 22:47.030
we are taking the freeway.
Agreed?

22:47.060 --> 22:48.790
Agreed.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.890
Agreed.
Agreed.

22:51.950 --> 22:53.500
Don't tell me what to do.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.250
Yo! Welcome to
<i>America Needs Talent!</i>

23:08.290 --> 23:11.060
I'm killin' it backstage in Hollywood

23:11.090 --> 23:13.230
as the contestants arrive!

23:13.260 --> 23:18.060
From crooners
we've got it all.rs,

23:18.100 --> 23:21.280
Like this guy here, who creeps me out.

23:21.660 --> 23:26.350
They call me The Great Panini!

23:27.910 --> 23:29.080
Big deal.
A quarter.

23:29.110 --> 23:31.080
What am I supposed to do with ten cents?

23:40.190 --> 23:41.220
Whoa!

23:44.130 --> 23:46.160
I could do
with this. Ndry.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.160
Kidding!
I don't do laundry.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.030
I'm super rich a lot of shirts.

23:52.100 --> 23:55.240
Anyway,
just one contestant. Missing.

23:55.270 --> 23:58.970
Tween singing sensation Chyna Parks.

23:59.010 --> 24:00.010
She's missing?

24:00.040 --> 24:03.110
I mean, she's missing?

24:04.380 --> 24:08.050
I'm here.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.280
Whoa!
I'm here!

24:11.320 --> 24:13.220
Why do you smell like fish?

24:13.250 --> 24:15.060
And why are you covered in oil?

24:18.230 --> 24:20.290
Over here!

24:20.330 --> 24:22.060
Mommy!

24:22.100 --> 24:23.030
Can't you guys just jump down?

24:23.060 --> 24:25.030
I...
...don't...

24:25.070 --> 24:25.930
...think...
...so.

24:25.970 --> 24:28.270
It's...
...going...

24:28.300 --> 24:31.040
...too...
...fast.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.140
Okay, maybe there's a way to stop it.

24:33.170 --> 24:35.240
Then you'll each be able to
hop off near the ground.

24:37.350 --> 24:40.080
Ooh! There's a shut off switch
on the other side of the gate!

24:43.290 --> 24:46.020
I can't quite reach it.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.130
But I can almost fit through the bars.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.030
Just...
...make...

24:53.060 --> 24:56.260
...yourself...
...slippery!

24:56.300 --> 24:58.270
Slippery?
With what?

25:00.200 --> 25:03.340
"Pickled herring packed in oil"?

25:05.140 --> 25:06.110
Oh!

25:08.280 --> 25:10.150
We couldn't take the freeway!

25:10.180 --> 25:11.950
And miss this?

25:11.980 --> 25:13.220
Whee!

25:17.190 --> 25:18.120
Okay.

25:19.260 --> 25:21.160
You can do this.

25:21.190 --> 25:24.200
<i>America Needs Talent.</i>
<i>America Needs Talent.</i>

25:43.120 --> 25:44.080
Oh!

25:46.220 --> 25:47.150
Okay.

25:47.190 --> 25:49.150
Okay.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.300
Oh, yes!

26:14.110 --> 26:16.180
Aw, the ride's over?

26:17.080 --> 26:18.080
Again! Again!

26:22.220 --> 26:25.960
I saved a fish from drowning

26:27.330 --> 26:30.000
in an oil spill.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.070
The viewer votes are in
and only four of you

26:40.110 --> 26:41.070
will move on to the final round.

26:41.110 --> 26:44.210
It's time to say goodbye to

26:44.240 --> 26:45.040
Paula the Pretzel,

26:47.980 --> 26:48.950
Musical Mike,

26:51.120 --> 26:52.120
Hat Man,

26:52.320 --> 26:55.050
and Kung Fu Granny.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.230
Didn't even feel it!

27:03.260 --> 27:05.030
I do 200 face crunches every morning.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.100
Well, it looks like the
viewers will choose between.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.970
The Great Panini,

27:14.010 --> 27:14.910
Lexi Reed,

27:14.940 --> 27:17.240
Jugglin' Jehoshaphat,

27:17.280 --> 27:20.280
and our youngest contestant
ever, Chyna Parks!

27:21.310 --> 27:24.320
I am so proud of Chyna.

27:25.950 --> 27:27.220
Huh?

27:27.250 --> 27:29.120
The viewers don't know this,

27:29.150 --> 27:32.060
but I've personally taken
Chyna under my wing

27:32.090 --> 27:35.130
so that someday she can
be as talented as I am.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.160
Maybe not this year.

27:37.200 --> 27:40.000
I hope with my help, she'll have her day.

27:40.030 --> 27:41.330
Again, not this year.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.200
I didn't know you two were so close.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.010
Neither did I.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.080
Tell you what.
We'll call the hotel

27:50.110 --> 27:53.050
and make sure that you two
can room together.

27:53.080 --> 27:56.120
That way, our audience can share
in your behind-the-scenes fun.

27:56.150 --> 27:57.120
What?
What?

27:59.190 --> 28:02.290
What a great idea!

28:02.320 --> 28:06.930
I would love to room with my best friend.

28:13.030 --> 28:16.000
What kind of hug is that, best friend?

28:16.040 --> 28:17.270
Come on, bring it in!

28:26.950 --> 28:31.980
Whoa, what are you doing
with all those word boxes?

28:32.020 --> 28:33.050
They're called books.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.220
And I'm studying in case
I get on that game show.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.090
Okay.
Roman Emperors.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.230
Tiberius, Caligula, Nero...

28:42.160 --> 28:43.930
His name is Nemo,

28:43.960 --> 28:46.930
and he's not an emperor.

28:46.970 --> 28:49.000
He's a fish who has adventures.

28:51.310 --> 28:54.140
Paisley, this game show is important.

28:54.170 --> 28:56.110
How about you let me do your makeup?

28:56.140 --> 28:58.110
Have you heard of the drop cloth technique?

28:58.140 --> 28:59.980
La-la-la!
Not listening.

29:00.010 --> 29:03.150
Keeping my head free
of useless information.

29:03.180 --> 29:06.880
A little extra powder under
the eyes during application

29:06.920 --> 29:08.020
to catch any eye makeup fallout.

29:10.020 --> 29:10.420
Are you done?

29:15.290 --> 29:17.990
I just got an email
from <i>The Brainy Bunch!</i>

29:18.030 --> 29:20.060
I'm going to be a contestant!

29:20.100 --> 29:22.030
One time I ate at
a deli-contestant.

29:29.310 --> 29:31.270
Wait.
It's partner's week?

29:32.310 --> 29:34.980
I need a partner?

29:35.010 --> 29:36.250
Where am I going to find anyone?

29:36.280 --> 29:38.150
Everyone's busy!
Except...

29:38.180 --> 29:39.980
The TV isn't working!

29:41.990 --> 29:43.990
See?
The picture's frozen.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.990
Now I'll never find out what
happens to that bowl of fruit.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.070
Good morning!

30:00.310 --> 30:03.010
Wow!

30:03.040 --> 30:04.040
You guys get up early, huh?

30:08.210 --> 30:09.310
What's going on?

30:14.190 --> 30:18.190
I look just as good
as I always do! The morning.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.190
Me and my best friend Chyna
just like to play ghost.

30:21.230 --> 30:22.160
Ow!

30:24.200 --> 30:27.230
I mean, oooh!

30:27.270 --> 30:30.170
All right, I'm going to go hit the gym.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.970
By which I mean my cousin,
Jimmy the Gym Giamatti.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.140
He owes me 30 bucks.

30:39.010 --> 30:41.180
Okay. Well, I'm going
to take a shower.

30:41.210 --> 30:44.050
See if I can get the rest of this oil off.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.120
I slipped out of bed 15 times last night.

30:51.120 --> 30:54.260
Guess what!
I'm going to be on a game show!

30:54.290 --> 30:56.330
If you want to know if you're
smarter than a fifth grader,

30:56.360 --> 30:58.330
you're not.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.270
Anyway, help me search the room.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.200
I have to find out what Chyna is
singing on the show tomorrow.

31:05.070 --> 31:05.940
Why?

31:05.970 --> 31:09.040
I'm scheduled to perform before Chyna.

31:09.070 --> 31:13.080
If I sing her song first, I'll steal her
thunder and she'll look like a fool.

31:13.110 --> 31:16.110
I know what she's going to
sing on the show tomorrow.

31:16.150 --> 31:18.150
You do? What?
What is it?

31:19.320 --> 31:21.250
A song!

31:31.360 --> 31:34.030
According to this star map,

31:34.070 --> 31:35.370
Johnny Depp lives right

31:36.340 --> 31:38.070
in those bushes.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.970
Come on!

31:41.010 --> 31:42.110
What are all these people
standing in line for?

31:43.010 --> 31:45.240
A bacon truck.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.050
"Getting Piggy With It."

31:47.080 --> 31:51.020
The bacon truck!
This place is famous!

31:51.050 --> 31:53.290
But there are like
a million people in line.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.150
Well, we got to do something.

31:54.190 --> 31:56.320
They have a double bacon sandwich

31:56.360 --> 31:58.290
where the bread is more bacon!

32:03.130 --> 32:07.000
Lexi, what are you doing?

32:07.040 --> 32:08.300
Just putting your clothes away for you.

32:11.070 --> 32:13.070
Oh, well, thanks, Lexi.

32:13.110 --> 32:15.180
I've been so focused rehearsing my song.

32:15.210 --> 32:18.980
So, what are you going to sing?

32:19.010 --> 32:22.150
Probably a song you've
already done before, like...

32:22.180 --> 32:23.220
Dynamite.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.250
You're singing <i>Dynamite?</i>

32:25.290 --> 32:28.190
Oh, no, I meant my song's
going to be dynamite.

32:28.220 --> 32:30.120
But not
the song <i>Dynamite.</i>

32:30.160 --> 32:32.290
The song will be dynamite, but the
song will not <i>Dynamite.</i>

32:34.200 --> 32:36.330
It's going to be exceptional.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.100
You're singing
<i>Exceptional?</i>

32:38.130 --> 32:39.270
No, no, no.
I just meant

32:39.300 --> 32:40.170
my dynamite song that isn't <i>Dynamite</i>

32:40.200 --> 32:41.400
is going to be exceptional.

32:41.440 --> 32:45.170
Not the song <i>Exceptional,</i>
<i>but it will be exceptional.</i>

32:46.310 --> 32:48.310
You'll see.
It'll be beautiful.

32:49.210 --> 32:52.250
Okay, fine, don't tell me.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.320
But I will tell you one thing.

32:54.350 --> 32:57.150
It's going to be crazy and out there.

32:57.190 --> 33:02.120
These days you got to do something
really shocking to make an impression.

33:02.160 --> 33:04.130
Like Lady Gaga.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.190
Huh.

33:05.230 --> 33:09.130
And everything is in here.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.270
The song, the dance moves,
the costume design.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.170
Well, I'm going to go
down to the restaurant.

33:17.970 --> 33:19.110
You want anything?

33:19.140 --> 33:21.140
No, thanks.

33:21.180 --> 33:26.050
Everything I need is right here.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.250
Okay.
Well, if you're not hungry,

33:27.280 --> 33:28.080
you could've just told me that
without being so ominous.

33:35.020 --> 33:38.060
Wow, this is shocking.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.580
But not as shocking as this.

33:54.570 --> 33:59.140
Okay. Yesterday, the truck
left before we got any bacon,

33:59.180 --> 34:02.120
but today, failure is not an option.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.430
This is LA.

34:03.510 --> 34:06.080
Maybe a celebrity will come
by and distract everyone.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.350
Why wait?

34:07.820 --> 34:09.190
I'm a dead ringer for a celebrity.

34:10.070 --> 34:12.610
Look, everyone!
It's Oprah Winfrey!

34:16.290 --> 34:19.060
Who wants some bacon?

34:20.100 --> 34:23.900
Well, you don't have to stand in line

34:23.940 --> 34:27.199
because each of you are getting
your very own bacon truck!

34:30.110 --> 34:32.110
You get a bacon truck! You get a bacon truck!
You get a bacon truck!

34:32.139 --> 34:33.210
You all get a bacon truck!

34:33.239 --> 34:36.909
Whoo!

34:36.949 --> 34:39.120
Now, your bacon trucks
will be waiting for you

34:39.150 --> 34:42.090
in the long-term parking
at Long Beach Airport!

34:44.190 --> 34:47.060
This way! It's this way!
Go this way!

34:48.159 --> 34:50.260
Go! Whoo!

34:54.060 --> 34:56.170
Looks like we're next in
line after this kid orders.

34:57.170 --> 34:59.000
Oh, hey, guys!

34:59.270 --> 35:01.140
Angus?

35:01.170 --> 35:03.110
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

35:03.140 --> 35:05.040
Dude, bacon truck.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.910
I'll start with a bowl of bacon chowder

35:11.950 --> 35:13.150
in a bacon bowl.

35:13.180 --> 35:18.090
Chinese bacon salad, a bacon
burrito with bacon salsa.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.290
Ooh! Spaghetti and
bacon balls!

35:28.130 --> 35:31.930
And welcome back
to <i>The Brainy Bunch!</i>

35:31.970 --> 35:34.100
I'm your host, Barry Williams.

35:34.140 --> 35:37.110
Okay, Paisley, remember,

35:37.140 --> 35:39.080
let me answer all of the questions.

35:39.110 --> 35:44.110
We've met our contestants, so let's
start the game with this question!

35:44.150 --> 35:46.020
What mythological creature

35:46.050 --> 35:49.220
is a composite of half man half horse?

35:49.250 --> 35:51.150
So easy.

35:51.190 --> 35:53.260
Paisley, go ahead.

35:53.290 --> 35:55.020
What is cotton candy?

35:58.190 --> 36:02.000
I am sorry.
That is incorrect.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.900
And you don't have to answer
in the form of a question.

36:06.940 --> 36:08.140
Oh, I wasn't answering.

36:08.170 --> 36:11.140
I was just wondering what cotton candy is.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.910
Seriously, I have no idea.

36:15.910 --> 36:16.980
My mom!

36:19.050 --> 36:20.180
I like cookies!

36:23.090 --> 36:24.220
Yup! It's still working!

36:28.930 --> 36:31.160
You look familiar.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.100
Were you on
<i>The Partridge Family?</i>

36:37.030 --> 36:41.140
Oh! This is it.
Our big night.

36:41.170 --> 36:43.970
And if I can't win, I hope you do.

36:44.010 --> 36:46.980
And if I can't win, I hope
the building burns down.

36:48.980 --> 36:50.980
I'm kidding.
Oh.

36:55.020 --> 36:58.020
So, I cannot wait to see
what you have planned.

36:58.060 --> 37:00.090
Probably something incredibly original

37:00.130 --> 37:03.160
that no one will have ever seen before.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.900
Well, I think what I'm going to do

37:05.930 --> 37:08.200
is really going to surprise some people.

37:08.230 --> 37:10.200
Oh, it'll be a surprise.

37:10.240 --> 37:10.270
A big surprise.

37:15.170 --> 37:17.210
Yeah, that's what I just said.

37:17.980 --> 37:20.110
Why you talking all evil like?

37:23.580 --> 37:25.220
I'm terribly sorry, Paisley.

37:25.250 --> 37:28.950
I was looking for Roman Emperor Nero.

37:28.990 --> 37:30.960
Not, "Where am I?"

37:34.130 --> 37:35.230
"Where am I?"

37:35.260 --> 37:35.300
I don't know either!

37:40.100 --> 37:41.970
The game's not over yet though.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.940
Olive and Paisley can still
pull ahead and win the $50,000

37:46.970 --> 37:48.940
with the final jackpot question.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.040
We'll be back right after these messages.

37:53.110 --> 37:54.050
True!

37:58.150 --> 38:01.020
Listen, Paisley, this is important.

38:01.050 --> 38:04.020
When the host asks the final
question, do not press the buzzer.

38:04.060 --> 38:06.160
But...
No matter what,

38:06.190 --> 38:08.060
under any circumstances,

38:08.100 --> 38:10.130
even if the world is being
attacked by aliens,

38:10.160 --> 38:13.130
and your buzzer can activate a
force field to save mankind.

38:13.170 --> 38:15.900
Do not press the buzzer!

38:17.210 --> 38:19.940
Got it.

38:19.980 --> 38:21.180
Here's a test. If your name
is Paisley, press the buzzer.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.920
Okay, did you not press the buzzer

38:26.950 --> 38:27.920
because I told you not to,

38:27.950 --> 38:32.020
or because you forgot your name is Paisley?

38:32.050 --> 38:34.890
Doesn't matter. Works either way.
Just don't buzz.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.920
Welcome back to <i>The Brainy Bunch,</i>

38:36.960 --> 38:38.120
for the final jackpot question.

38:38.160 --> 38:42.060
The category is cosmetics.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.060
Oh, Sherwood Schwartz!

38:46.100 --> 38:50.140
What application technique uses a
little extra powder under the eyes

38:50.170 --> 38:53.140
to catch any makeup fallout?

38:53.170 --> 38:55.940
Ooh, I know this one!

38:55.980 --> 38:56.980
Buzz in.

38:57.010 --> 38:58.240
Seriously, press the buzzer!

38:58.280 --> 39:01.010
You said not to.
I know what I said!

39:01.050 --> 39:02.180
Now I'm saying, press the buzzer!

39:02.210 --> 39:04.050
This is another one of your tests.

39:04.080 --> 39:08.150
It's not a stinkin' test!
Buzz in!

39:08.190 --> 39:11.060
Come on, buzz. Come on, you can buzz.
Come on, buzz. Buzz!

39:11.090 --> 39:12.090
Buzz! Buzz!

39:16.900 --> 39:20.900
All right, Paisley. Tell the nice
man about the eye powder thingy.

39:20.940 --> 39:24.100
Actually, I'm going to need
the answer from you, Olive.

39:24.140 --> 39:25.170
But Paisley buzzed.

39:25.210 --> 39:28.010
No, you buzzed Paisley's buzzer.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.040
I didn't buzz her buzzer.
She buzzed her buzzer.

39:29.080 --> 39:32.080
Paisley, answer the buzzing question!

39:36.180 --> 39:38.950
Olive, you have five seconds
to answer the question.

39:38.990 --> 39:43.220
If you are incorrect, your
opponents will win the $50,000!

39:43.260 --> 39:45.190
Uh...

39:47.100 --> 39:48.130
Lipstick?

39:49.030 --> 39:50.230
No!

39:50.270 --> 39:52.270
The Drop Cloth technique!

39:52.300 --> 39:55.240
Jeff and Rachel, you win the $50,000.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.980
Bacon ice-cream
with hot bacon sauce.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.950
Oh, and a side of bacon.

40:11.190 --> 40:14.920
Guys, get up!
I'm done ordering.

40:14.960 --> 40:15.290
Out of my way, I'm ordering first!

40:15.320 --> 40:18.060
Whoo! Hoo!

40:19.990 --> 40:22.260
Sold out?
Are you kidding me?

40:22.300 --> 40:25.100
Don't worry.

40:25.130 --> 40:26.030
Their stuff's not even that good.

40:31.270 --> 40:33.170
Yo, taxi!

40:36.280 --> 40:38.180
San Francisco, please.

40:47.250 --> 40:52.320
Our next finalist is San
Francisco's own Lexi Reed!

40:58.030 --> 41:01.300

42:26.150 --> 42:30.020
Wow! That performance
makes me want a bear claw.

42:30.060 --> 42:34.130
An actual bear claw so I
could scratch out my eyes.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.160
Anyway, time to take a little break.

42:36.200 --> 42:40.230
Remember to call and text in your votes!

42:40.270 --> 42:44.070
Ha! Let's see what people think
when you do the exact same...

42:44.310 --> 42:46.040
Wait.

42:46.070 --> 42:47.070
You're not a donut.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.980
You look gorgeous!

42:50.010 --> 42:51.280
Thank you, Lexi.

42:53.110 --> 42:56.250
I don't understand.
I stole your song.

42:56.280 --> 42:59.320
No. You stole the fake song
I left for you to steal

42:59.350 --> 43:01.960
after I heard you tell Paisley your plan.

43:01.990 --> 43:04.290
That glass to the wall
thing, it really works.

43:08.130 --> 43:11.030
Welcome back to
<i>Yo, I'm from Jer...</i>

43:11.070 --> 43:16.000
I mean,
<i>America Needs Talent!</i>

43:16.040 --> 43:19.940
It's confusing being so
successful in the arts.

43:19.970 --> 43:21.280
How could you do this to me?

43:21.310 --> 43:24.210
You did it to yourself.

43:24.250 --> 43:26.210
You're really talented, Lexi.

43:26.250 --> 43:28.280
You should've just done your own song.

43:29.080 --> 43:32.020
What if it wasn't as good as yours?

43:32.050 --> 43:33.050
See?

43:33.090 --> 43:35.990
All you ever do is worry
about what I'm doing.

43:36.020 --> 43:37.290
Ever since I came to Webster High,

43:37.330 --> 43:40.160
you've seen me as a threat and
tried to make me feel small.

43:40.200 --> 43:45.170
Up next, pint-sized singing
sensation, Chyna Parks!

43:47.200 --> 43:49.070
Well, here's what I have to say to that.

43:55.340 --> 44:00.080

44:00.120 --> 44:04.320

45:47.290 --> 45:49.090
Don't look at me!

45:49.130 --> 45:49.990
I got spray tan in my eye!

45:53.030 --> 45:56.000
Chyna, that was amazing!

45:56.040 --> 45:57.140
Thanks, I just really...

45:57.170 --> 45:59.070
You really think I'm beautiful?

46:01.270 --> 46:05.010
You sang an entire song
about how I'm beautiful.

46:06.280 --> 46:09.150
Well, sure.

46:09.180 --> 46:09.280
Why not?

46:12.950 --> 46:16.090
And just remember, Lexi, we can both shine.

46:16.120 --> 46:17.990
There's plenty of room for the two of us.

46:27.130 --> 46:30.300
Well, the votes are in
and America has chosen.

46:41.310 --> 46:42.310
And no surprise,

46:42.350 --> 46:46.150
the winner of
<i>America Needs Talent</i> is...

46:49.060 --> 46:50.960
The Great Panini!

46:53.790 --> 46:58.590
The Great Panini is just my stage name.

46:58.590 --> 47:01.690
To most, I am known as...

47:04.430 --> 47:05.550
Gibson!

47:07.580 --> 47:10.640
Gibson? You're an amazing magician!

47:10.640 --> 47:12.640
But you were terrible at the tryouts.

47:12.640 --> 47:16.530
That's why I auditioned again in Seattle as The Great Panini.

47:16.530 --> 47:19.330
By the way, people get really freaked out

47:19.330 --> 47:21.330
when you wear a straitjacket on the bus.

47:22.530 --> 47:26.080
That trick you did ** yourself in half was incredible!

47:26.580 --> 47:28.080
How did you do it?

47:28.540 --> 47:30.170
Oh!

47:31.210 --> 47:33.800
A magician never reveals his secrets.

47:36.380 --> 47:39.510
Well, I guess we both come back to San Francisco.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.510
Yeah.

47:41.510 --> 47:43.510
♪♪ both your suitcases?
