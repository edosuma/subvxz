<i>Kids, there are two big
days in any love story:</i>

<i>the day you meet
the girl of your dreams,</i>

00:40.815 --> 00:43.650
Nice! Where'd
you get this?

00:43.651 --> 00:45.786
Stashed a cooler
behind the pulpit.

00:45.787 --> 00:46.954
Beer be with you.

00:46.955 --> 00:48.205
And also with you.

00:51.409 --> 00:53.660
Man, this is what
church has been missing.

00:53.661 --> 00:54.912
Dude, you
fixed church.

00:54.913 --> 00:56.046
Yeah.
You're welcome, God.

00:57.215 --> 00:58.999
Nervous?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.802
What? No. I'm just
hoping it doesn't rain.

01:01.803 --> 01:03.370
Why? Do I
look nervous?

01:03.371 --> 01:05.589
Look at your beer,
dude.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.841
You always do that
when you're nervous.

01:11.012 --> 01:14.398
It's a sad day
in New York, Ted.

01:14.399 --> 01:15.632
A sad day, indeed.

01:15.633 --> 01:18.468
Do you know what I saw
on my way in here?

01:18.469 --> 01:20.154
A girl...

01:20.155 --> 01:22.189
In a sweater.

01:22.190 --> 01:23.907
And you know what that means.

01:23.908 --> 01:27.327
The season
of exposed skin is over.

01:27.328 --> 01:29.029
Exactly.

01:29.030 --> 01:30.781
Gone are the
tank tops, Ted.

01:30.782 --> 01:32.533
Gone are the cute little skirts.

01:32.534 --> 01:34.251
Gone are the
sun dresses.

01:34.252 --> 01:35.536
The sun dresses, Ted!

01:35.537 --> 01:37.154
I don't think

01:37.155 --> 01:39.489
I can make it another eight
months with no sun dresses.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.625
Barney, I really...
I have to grade these papers.

01:41.626 --> 01:42.876
I'm sorry. I'll let you work.

01:42.877 --> 01:43.927
But first,

01:43.928 --> 01:45.629
a riddle:

01:45.630 --> 01:47.181
What piece of women's attire

01:47.182 --> 01:49.883
most stokes a man's desire?

01:49.884 --> 01:51.101
A sun dress.

01:51.102 --> 01:52.469
Correct.

01:52.470 --> 01:54.388
What lightweight outfit,

01:54.389 --> 01:56.173
pink or white,

01:56.174 --> 01:59.693
makes the front of my slacks
abnormally tight?

01:59.694 --> 02:00.944
I really have to get this done.

02:00.945 --> 02:02.229
Of course, of course.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.780
Thank you.

02:03.781 --> 02:04.898
"Sun dress," by the way.

02:04.899 --> 02:07.201
Hey!

02:07.202 --> 02:10.187
What are you nervous about?
Tell me.

02:10.187 --> 02:11.238
Tell me. Tell me.

02:11.239 --> 02:12.906
What flowing cotton frock...

02:12.907 --> 02:14.791
Okay, I'll tell you. Just...

02:14.792 --> 02:16.493
There's a...

02:16.494 --> 02:17.928
There's a girl

02:17.929 --> 02:19.796
sitting at the bar.

02:19.797 --> 02:21.632
Don't look!

02:21.633 --> 02:23.934
I want to see a pretty girl.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.120
Okay, you can look.
Just-just-just be cool for once.

02:27.121 --> 02:29.339
I'll be cool.

02:36.047 --> 02:37.431
Ah, Ted.

02:37.432 --> 02:39.466
You got your beer label
in a bunch over nothing.

02:39.467 --> 02:40.567
Listen to your
Uncle Barney.

02:40.568 --> 02:44.388
You have no reason
to be nervous.

02:44.389 --> 02:45.889
None whatsoever.

02:45.890 --> 02:49.526
And I'm going to tell
you why in one word.

02:49.527 --> 02:50.611
And what's that word?

02:50.612 --> 02:52.129
- Dibs!
- What...

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

03:05.126 --> 03:06.627
You can't call dibs on a girl

03:06.628 --> 03:08.679
I've been sitting here
thinking about maybe talking to

03:08.680 --> 03:09.980
eventually at some point.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.848
You never called dibs.

03:11.849 --> 03:13.267
Dibs were implied.

03:13.268 --> 03:15.602
- Implied dibs?
- Yeah.

03:15.603 --> 03:17.804
Ted, you are spitting
on the grave

03:17.805 --> 03:21.108
of Sir Walter Dibs,
inventor of the dib.

03:21.109 --> 03:22.425
It was 1652...

03:22.426 --> 03:24.294
<i>The SS Dibs was lost at sea...</i>

03:24.295 --> 03:26.330
Look, I don't have time
for a fake history lesson,

03:26.331 --> 03:27.764
so I'll keep this simple.

03:27.765 --> 03:29.483
You go over there
and talk to that girl,

03:29.484 --> 03:30.934
I will see you in court.

03:30.935 --> 03:33.370
And who's gonna represent you?
Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!

03:33.371 --> 03:34.488
Damn it!

03:34.489 --> 03:35.605
Where is Marshall anyway?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.157
<i>Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily</i>

03:37.158 --> 03:38.258
<i>had recently decided</i>

03:38.259 --> 03:40.027
<i>to take a swing
at starting a family.</i>

03:40.028 --> 03:42.279
Tonight was their first at-bat.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.814
Okay,
I'm almost ready to leave.

03:43.815 --> 03:45.582
Let's just go
through the checklist. Candles?

03:45.583 --> 03:46.750
Check.

03:46.751 --> 03:47.951
Music to set the mood?

03:48.836 --> 03:50.754
Check.

03:50.755 --> 03:52.222
Music for when
we're actually doing it?

03:54.458 --> 03:56.343
Check.

03:57.545 --> 03:58.612
You know what?

03:58.613 --> 03:59.980
To hell with your dibs.

03:59.981 --> 04:01.648
I'm going over there right now
and talking to her.

04:01.649 --> 04:03.267
Oh, yeah, yeah?
Be my guest.

04:03.268 --> 04:05.185
Fall in love with her.
Get married.

04:05.186 --> 04:06.403
Just know this:

04:06.404 --> 04:08.155
When I step up
to make my toast

04:08.156 --> 04:09.523
as your best man...

04:09.524 --> 04:10.941
Actually, Marshall would
probably be...

04:10.942 --> 04:12.526
As your best man...

04:12.527 --> 04:14.661
Ladies and Gentlemen...

04:14.662 --> 04:17.998
I... had dibs.

04:17.999 --> 04:20.350
No!
What?

04:20.351 --> 04:21.918
Tell me this
isn't true.

04:21.918 --> 04:24.037
I had implied dibs.

04:25.206 --> 04:26.506
You know,

04:26.507 --> 04:28.875
you've humiliated me!

04:28.876 --> 04:30.877
I had no idea.
You have to know that.

04:32.597 --> 04:34.548
You're the victim
here. We both are.

04:35.383 --> 04:36.600
Let's get out of here.

04:36.601 --> 04:39.186
Or, you know, we could
just do it right here.

04:39.187 --> 04:41.271
We could just do
it right here.

04:43.308 --> 04:44.691
Fine.

04:44.692 --> 04:45.859
Have at it.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.344
Exercise your dibs.

04:47.345 --> 04:49.396
She's got her shields up anyway.
She's reading a book.

04:49.397 --> 04:51.014
Yeah.

04:51.015 --> 04:52.482
At a bar.

04:52.483 --> 04:53.650
That book might as well
be called,

04:53.651 --> 04:55.786
<i>Are You There, Barney?
It's Me, Horny.</i>

04:55.787 --> 04:56.753
That is not

04:56.754 --> 04:58.955
what "shields up" looks like.

04:58.956 --> 05:01.241
That is what
"shields up" looks like.

05:01.242 --> 05:03.627
Move.

05:03.628 --> 05:05.829
God!

05:07.832 --> 05:10.250
Hey. 'Sup, dudes?

05:10.251 --> 05:12.202
Fries?

05:12.203 --> 05:14.388
Oh, good God, woman.
You're a disgrace.

05:14.389 --> 05:16.056
No fries for this guy.

05:16.057 --> 05:17.140
Robin,

05:17.141 --> 05:19.509
seriously, I love you,
but it's like

05:19.510 --> 05:21.711
you have
squiggly cartoon odor lines

05:21.712 --> 05:23.096
coming off of you right now.

05:23.097 --> 05:24.114
You know what,
Barney?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.899
Just cut her some slack, okay?

05:25.900 --> 05:28.652
She just went
through a breakup.

05:28.653 --> 05:29.903
With hygiene?

05:29.904 --> 05:31.605
<i>No, with Don.</i>

05:31.606 --> 05:33.390
<i>A few months earlier...</i>

05:33.391 --> 05:35.242
Here, have some tea.

05:35.243 --> 05:36.326
Thanks.

05:36.327 --> 05:37.694
Robin, I am
here for you.

05:37.695 --> 05:38.895
Whatever you need.

05:38.896 --> 05:41.198
Okay, about that.

05:41.199 --> 05:42.783
Ted, listen.

05:42.784 --> 05:45.369
I know myself pretty well.

05:45.370 --> 05:48.288
And, some time over
the next few months,

05:48.289 --> 05:50.323
I'm going to want
to sleep with you.

05:50.324 --> 05:51.942
And when that happens,

05:51.943 --> 05:53.377
you have to try to say no.

05:53.378 --> 05:54.761
Try?

05:54.762 --> 05:56.213
I will absolutely say no.

05:56.214 --> 05:57.431
Our friendship
is too important.

05:59.384 --> 06:01.385
Okay, you know,
maybe I wasn't clear enough.

06:03.054 --> 06:05.605
I will come at you
with everything I've got.

06:05.606 --> 06:06.589
I will stalk you

06:06.590 --> 06:09.476
like the lioness
stalks the gazelle:

06:09.477 --> 06:12.646
careful, patient, deadly.

06:12.647 --> 06:15.065
And if you let
your guard down

06:15.066 --> 06:16.116
for so much as a second,

06:16.117 --> 06:17.934
as sure as you were born,

06:17.935 --> 06:21.822
I will hump your brains out.

06:26.210 --> 06:30.163
Okay, I'm ready to have sex now.

06:31.449 --> 06:33.133
It was a tough summer,

06:33.134 --> 06:35.302
but I think our girl's
been a real trooper.

06:35.303 --> 06:38.255
She's...

06:38.256 --> 06:39.673
Is this a Cheeto?

06:39.674 --> 06:41.458
No, we ran out
of Cheetos last week.

06:41.459 --> 06:44.511
Oh, yeah,
it's a Cheeto. Dibs.

06:44.512 --> 06:46.680
Oh, you're exquisite.

06:46.681 --> 06:48.665
You must let me paint you.

06:48.666 --> 06:49.816
Hey Robin, what
do you think?

06:49.817 --> 06:50.884
The girl sitting
at the bar.

06:50.885 --> 06:52.269
Shields up?

06:52.270 --> 06:55.021
Mmm, totes, toots.
She's here on a date.

06:55.022 --> 06:57.441
She brought the book
because she got here early,

06:57.442 --> 07:00.360
and she also wants to impress
the guy she's meeting.

07:00.361 --> 07:03.313
Girls like to come across all
classy and smart, you know?

07:05.333 --> 07:06.983
This?
What you're doing right now?

07:06.984 --> 07:09.486
I'm getting a "de-rection."

07:10.488 --> 07:13.173
Hey! How'd it go?
You pregnant yet?

07:13.174 --> 07:14.341
Nope!

07:14.342 --> 07:15.992
Okay, so, here's
what happened.

07:15.993 --> 07:17.944
I was at home,
waiting for Marshall.

07:17.945 --> 07:20.096
Hey! How was your day?

07:20.097 --> 07:21.431
Don't answer. No time.

07:21.432 --> 07:23.216
Bedroom.
No, no. No time.

07:23.217 --> 07:24.634
Floor. No, no time.

07:24.635 --> 07:25.769
Against this wall!

07:25.770 --> 07:26.853
Marshall, whoa! Wait.

07:26.854 --> 07:29.055
A big package just arrived.

07:29.056 --> 07:30.106
Yeah, it did.

07:30.107 --> 07:31.107
No, no.

07:31.108 --> 07:33.276
It's a real package
from your dad.

07:33.277 --> 07:35.946
Well, that's a little weird,
but yeah, it is.

07:35.947 --> 07:37.814
Marshall, look!

07:39.851 --> 07:41.485
A bassinet? Oh, my...

07:41.486 --> 07:44.488
He must've made it
in his wood shop.

07:44.489 --> 07:46.523
Wasn't that sweet of him?

07:46.524 --> 07:48.458
Lil?

07:48.459 --> 07:50.577
Isn't that sweet?

07:50.578 --> 07:53.163
Lily?

07:53.164 --> 07:56.233
You told your dad we're trying
to have a baby?

07:56.234 --> 07:58.351
Of course I did.
I tell my dad everything.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.886
My dad is my best friend.

08:01.422 --> 08:04.891
Lily, we have been
looking forward

08:04.892 --> 08:08.245
to this magical, special night
for two weeks now.

08:08.246 --> 08:11.598
And, sweetie, during that time,
I have been...

08:11.599 --> 08:14.935
How do I put this delicately?

08:14.936 --> 08:18.471
Saving all my love for you.

08:19.690 --> 08:23.226
I have read 11 books
on conception.

08:23.227 --> 08:24.561
I have cut out

08:24.562 --> 08:26.830
alcohol, caffeine and sugar.

08:26.831 --> 08:28.698
I take my temperature
every hour.

08:28.699 --> 08:32.001
But good for you
for not playing with yourself.

08:33.688 --> 08:34.754
I feel you, buddy.

08:34.755 --> 08:36.506
Ah, no! Don't
even touch me, dude.

08:36.506 --> 08:38.241
It's been, like...
It's been two weeks.

08:38.241 --> 08:41.745
I'm, like, a light breeze away
from having a big problem.

08:41.746 --> 08:43.462
Seriously.

08:45.049 --> 08:46.466
Okay, I'm better now.

08:48.252 --> 08:49.919
Okay, Barney.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.471
What's this going
to cost me?

08:51.472 --> 08:52.455
Excuse me?

08:52.456 --> 08:53.640
Your dibs.
I want to buy your dibs.

08:53.641 --> 08:56.109
Two... hundred...

08:56.110 --> 08:57.811
and fifty thousand dollars.

08:57.812 --> 08:59.029
20 bucks.

09:00.481 --> 09:01.982
But I...

09:01.983 --> 09:03.116
Can I go smell her first?

09:03.117 --> 09:04.868
- No.
- Fine.

09:04.869 --> 09:06.519
All right.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.321
Wish me luck.

09:09.390 --> 09:11.975
<i>Now kids,
remember how I told you</i>

09:11.976 --> 09:13.443
<i>about a girl named Cindy?</i>

09:13.444 --> 09:15.945
<i>How I went on one date
with her and it ended...</i>

09:15.946 --> 09:16.913
Get out.

09:16.914 --> 09:18.281
<i>badly? Well...</i>

09:18.282 --> 09:19.833
How are you?
Good.

09:25.172 --> 09:26.139
What the hell are you doing?

09:26.140 --> 09:27.257
That girl she's
talking to?

09:27.258 --> 09:28.958
I dated her.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.595
Oh, that sucks!

09:31.596 --> 09:33.680
And dibs.

09:37.064 --> 09:40.032
So you went on one date
with one of her friends.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.884
It's not necessarily a big deal.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.519
I mean, did it end on bad terms?

09:45.706 --> 09:47.873
Oh, hi Cindy!

09:47.874 --> 09:49.692
Oh, hi Cindy.

09:53.664 --> 09:55.665
Well, I guess
you just got to move on.

09:55.666 --> 09:56.832
I mean, it's not like
you have a shot

09:56.833 --> 09:59.101
with Ready McGee
over there, right?

10:00.337 --> 10:01.404
Ted?

10:01.405 --> 10:03.055
<i>Then I remembered.</i>

10:03.056 --> 10:04.724
<i>Cindy had a roommate.</i>

10:04.725 --> 10:08.043
<i>A roommate
I only caught a glimpse of...</i>

10:08.762 --> 10:10.146
<i>But a roommate who,</i>

10:10.147 --> 10:13.899
<i>by every indication,
was something very special.</i>

10:13.900 --> 10:16.435
<i>Was it possible?</i>

10:16.436 --> 10:20.723
<i>Could this be the girl
attached to that ankle?</i>

10:21.908 --> 10:25.044
I got to see her ankles.

10:25.045 --> 10:26.796
You're one of those?

10:26.797 --> 10:29.248
God, I swear,
one in five guys...

10:29.249 --> 10:31.066
<i>Lily!</i>

10:31.067 --> 10:33.169
We kind of had a plan tonight,
remember?

10:33.170 --> 10:34.954
Candles? Banjo?

10:34.955 --> 10:37.256
Who else did you tell? Did you
tell anyone at the office?

10:42.963 --> 10:44.347
Shannon?

10:44.348 --> 10:46.682
Start the music.

10:50.354 --> 10:53.105
Can you dig it?!

10:55.559 --> 10:57.426
Take it to the
hole, Eriksen!

10:57.427 --> 10:59.645
Sink that putt,
big fuzz!

10:59.646 --> 11:01.397
Put a pillow under
her lower back.

11:01.398 --> 11:04.533
It helps facilitate
conception, bro!

11:10.157 --> 11:12.775
I may have mentioned it
in passing

11:12.776 --> 11:14.577
to a couple of colleagues
at work.

11:14.578 --> 11:16.579
I'm sorry about that,
but you know what?

11:16.580 --> 11:18.781
I got to be able
to tell my dad.

11:18.782 --> 11:21.384
Your dad is the last person
you should tell!

11:21.385 --> 11:23.952
The man is too involved
in our lives!

11:23.953 --> 11:26.722
It's like,
every time the phone rings...

11:26.723 --> 11:28.391
Hello.

11:28.392 --> 11:30.009
Lily, Marvin Eriksen.

11:30.010 --> 11:32.261
I noticed you hadn't changed
your last name yet.

11:32.262 --> 11:33.629
No, I'm gonna...

11:33.630 --> 11:35.398
So, don't worry.
I called the DMV,

11:35.399 --> 11:38.401
I called your Amex, I got
that process started for you.

11:39.236 --> 11:41.170
Hello.

11:41.171 --> 11:42.805
Lily, Marvin Eriksen.

11:42.806 --> 11:43.873
I understand

11:43.874 --> 11:45.274
you and Marshall
have been fighting.

11:45.275 --> 11:48.077
Well, let me tell you what works
for me and the missus.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.679
Frilly French undies
and a box of wine.

11:51.448 --> 11:53.082
Hello.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.301
You might want
to try pickles on that sandwich.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.472
Pickles would have helped
that sandwich!

11:59.473 --> 12:01.841
The man has no boundaries.

12:01.842 --> 12:04.877
And I just can't procreate
under these conditions!

12:04.878 --> 12:06.161
Yeah, well, you know what?

12:06.162 --> 12:08.547
I've already told him,
so the damage is done.

12:08.548 --> 12:11.517
So, call him and tell him
we decided not to have a baby.

12:11.518 --> 12:13.001
Okay, so you just...

12:13.002 --> 12:15.388
You want me
to give my dad a stroke?

12:16.556 --> 12:18.874
Only if you want
to give this a stroke.

12:18.875 --> 12:19.975
That's ridiculous.

12:19.976 --> 12:22.228
Lily, there is no way
that I would ever...

12:24.030 --> 12:26.065
Okay, everyone needs

12:26.066 --> 12:28.017
to shut up so
that I can think!

12:28.018 --> 12:31.237
They're talking
to a guy now.

12:31.238 --> 12:33.255
What kind of guy?
A cheesy guy or a cool guy?

12:33.256 --> 12:34.623
Oh, a cheesy guy.
Don't worry.

12:34.624 --> 12:36.509
Oh, man!

12:36.510 --> 12:37.693
That guy is cool.

12:37.694 --> 12:40.329
His hair's all cool,
he's got a cool belt.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.047
Well, that guy is cheesy,

12:42.048 --> 12:43.966
and if you think
he's not cheesy,

12:43.967 --> 12:47.303
then you're cheesy, too,
and now I want something cheesy.

12:47.304 --> 12:49.438
Who's feeling nachos?

12:49.439 --> 12:50.689
Oh, look at you, Robin.

12:50.690 --> 12:51.891
You're jealous.

12:51.892 --> 12:53.159
Jealous?

12:53.160 --> 12:54.393
Yeah, jealous,

12:54.394 --> 12:57.045
because she's got it,
and you've lost it.

12:57.046 --> 12:59.281
I have not lost it.

12:59.282 --> 13:00.382
You lost it.

13:00.383 --> 13:02.184
I still have it.

13:02.185 --> 13:03.986
I know exactly where it is,

13:03.987 --> 13:06.989
and I can go get it
whenever I want.

13:06.990 --> 13:09.859
Robin, girls are
like cartons of milk.

13:09.860 --> 13:11.760
Each one has a hotness
expiration date,

13:11.761 --> 13:13.412
and you've hit yours.

13:13.413 --> 13:16.198
I'm not saying the occasional
guy won't still open the fridge,

13:16.199 --> 13:19.151
pick you up, give a sniff,
shrug and take a sip anyway.

13:19.152 --> 13:21.120
But it's all
downhill from here.

13:21.121 --> 13:23.238
I don't have to take this.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.092
But I do have to take this.

13:28.879 --> 13:30.245
Okay, so you just want me

13:30.246 --> 13:31.597
to call my dad and tell him

13:31.598 --> 13:32.798
that we're not having a baby?

13:32.799 --> 13:34.266
That's about the size of it.

13:34.267 --> 13:36.552
Okay, out of curiosity,

13:36.553 --> 13:38.821
when do we tell him
about the baby?

13:38.822 --> 13:40.088
We'll tell him about the baby

13:40.089 --> 13:41.891
when there's a baby
to tell him about.

13:41.892 --> 13:43.943
So, he just gets no notice?

13:43.944 --> 13:45.778
He just walks
into his boss's office,

13:45.779 --> 13:47.596
and says,
"I just had a grandson.

13:47.597 --> 13:49.465
I'm gonna be out
for three months."

13:49.466 --> 13:51.167
Out for three months?

13:51.168 --> 13:52.535
Yeah.

13:52.536 --> 13:53.619
He and my mom are coming

13:53.620 --> 13:55.287
to live with us
when the baby's born.

13:56.239 --> 13:57.389
We talked about this.

13:57.390 --> 13:58.858
No, we didn't.

13:58.859 --> 14:01.026
I meant, me and my dad.

14:01.027 --> 14:02.127
You know what, Marshall?

14:02.128 --> 14:04.446
Why don't you have a baby
with your dad?

14:04.447 --> 14:05.948
Oh, okay, Lily.

14:05.949 --> 14:08.417
Why don't you have a baby
with your butt?

14:08.418 --> 14:09.451
What?

14:10.587 --> 14:12.555
I can't think straight!

14:12.556 --> 14:14.924
Why do you have to
wear that shirt?

14:14.925 --> 14:18.561
This is not how I thought
this night was going to go!

14:24.467 --> 14:26.134
Ted?

14:30.379 --> 14:33.380
Oh, God, this sucks!
Do you think she saw me?

14:33.381 --> 14:34.414
Hi, Ted!

14:34.415 --> 14:36.500
Yeah, she
definitely saw you.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.119
Can I see you for a minute...
in private?

14:39.120 --> 14:41.121
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

14:41.122 --> 14:44.341
I mean, how could
that not be fun?

14:46.294 --> 14:49.496
If I don't come back,
tell my mom I love her.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.431
Okay, will do. And dibs.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.736
Barney, am I crazy?

14:55.737 --> 14:58.155
Marshall talks
to his dad way too much, right?

14:58.156 --> 15:00.524
Oh, you don't want my opinion
on that.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.508
Why not?

15:01.509 --> 15:03.610
If I had my dad's number,

15:03.611 --> 15:06.647
<i>I would never not be
on the phone with him.</i>

15:06.648 --> 15:08.448
That was really...

15:08.449 --> 15:10.434
Whoa, a hottie with a body!

15:10.435 --> 15:12.336
Boing...!

15:12.337 --> 15:13.387
Brief.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.122
No. Lily, look.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.460
You saucy
little minx.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.663
You sundressed up.

15:24.849 --> 15:26.049
Hi.

15:27.335 --> 15:28.652
14 seconds!

15:28.653 --> 15:30.621
14 seconds, and already

15:30.622 --> 15:32.105
some dingdong
is stepping up,

15:32.106 --> 15:34.575
thinking he can get
some of this broke off.

15:35.777 --> 15:38.562
I... still... got... it.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.849
All right, buddy, you proved
my point. Now scram.

15:43.635 --> 15:45.986
Nice belt,
by the way.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.292
Robin, you do
look super hot.

15:52.293 --> 15:53.526
Oh, do I?

15:53.527 --> 15:54.711
Yeah, you do.

15:54.712 --> 15:56.496
Thanks.

15:59.384 --> 16:01.552
<i>I braced myself
for what was next:</i>

16:01.553 --> 16:04.421
<i>rage, fury,
a possible shanking.</i>

16:06.558 --> 16:07.775
Thank you, Ted.

16:07.776 --> 16:09.560
After things didn't
work out with us,

16:09.561 --> 16:11.395
I got really sad
for a while.

16:11.396 --> 16:13.247
But then I realized,

16:13.248 --> 16:16.016
you're not what I wanted, Ted,
and I'm not what you wanted.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.517
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.020
I feel like I should
make it up to you somehow.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.289
You know, buy you a beer
or Yankees tickets, or...

16:22.290 --> 16:24.575
Or set me up with
one of your friends.

16:24.576 --> 16:26.193
No, I'm kidding.
That would be weird.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.112
- No, it wouldn't.
- It wouldn't, would it?

16:28.113 --> 16:29.963
Any one of
those three.

16:29.964 --> 16:31.915
Whichever's easiest
and right nearby.

16:32.667 --> 16:33.851
And not the beer.

16:33.852 --> 16:34.868
I should get back.

16:34.869 --> 16:35.919
Totally.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.721
Come say good-bye
before you leave.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.707
Say good-bye before you leave?

16:40.708 --> 16:42.209
Her words exactly.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.011
Dude, you are so in.

16:44.012 --> 16:45.212
That is so awesome.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.014
A high five doesn't
even cut it.

16:47.015 --> 16:49.316
High six!

16:49.317 --> 16:51.702
She didn't see us
high-six, did she?

16:51.703 --> 16:53.353
No. Good. That was pretty lame.

16:53.354 --> 16:56.356
Yeah, let's never
do that again.

16:56.357 --> 16:57.524
Marshall?

16:57.525 --> 16:58.609
What? Lily, what?

16:58.610 --> 17:00.110
Are there more members

17:00.111 --> 17:02.162
of my family that you
want to crap all over?

17:02.163 --> 17:04.564
- Here's the thing.
- I'm sorry. Hold on.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.083
Just...

17:06.084 --> 17:07.617
It's my dad.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.121
Lily, it's my dad, okay?

17:11.122 --> 17:14.608
I love him, and if he calls me,
I'm gonna answer the phone!

17:16.377 --> 17:18.011
Hey, Dad.

17:18.012 --> 17:20.597
Hey, hey. I know it's late,
but I just had to call.

17:20.598 --> 17:22.215
How'd it go?
Dad, this is...

17:22.217 --> 17:23.599
Did you do everything
the books say?

17:23.601 --> 17:25.135
Did you put the pillow
under her back?

17:25.136 --> 17:26.703
Dad, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

17:26.704 --> 17:28.305
Did it feel like a boy?

17:28.306 --> 17:29.523
You can tell.

17:29.524 --> 17:31.225
He's insane.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.760
My dad is insane.

17:34.729 --> 17:37.397
I'm so sorry, Lily.

17:38.450 --> 17:40.234
He's just...

17:40.235 --> 17:44.437
He's so...

17:44.438 --> 17:46.507
enthusiastic.

17:46.508 --> 17:48.492
It's ridiculous, you know?

17:48.493 --> 17:50.577
Like, who's like that?

17:51.412 --> 17:53.497
You.

17:53.498 --> 17:55.983
You're like that.

17:55.984 --> 18:00.003
You and your dad
both care so much.

18:00.004 --> 18:02.289
It's... it's why
women fall in love

18:02.290 --> 18:05.075
with the Eriksen men
to begin with.

18:05.977 --> 18:08.745
But right now,
it's a lot of pressure.

18:08.746 --> 18:11.315
Baby, I'm not trying to
pressure you one bit.

18:11.316 --> 18:13.851
What if I can't have a baby?

18:14.903 --> 18:17.070
That could happen.

18:17.071 --> 18:19.857
I could totally let you down.

18:19.858 --> 18:23.694
Has that thought
not occurred to you?

18:25.113 --> 18:27.114
Not even for one second.

18:31.669 --> 18:34.955
Not having a baby would suck,

18:34.956 --> 18:37.875
but the idea of you
letting me down...

18:37.876 --> 18:41.361
that's impossible.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.349
That would be like
aliens landing.

18:46.467 --> 18:49.520
That's a bad example,
because that could happen.

18:49.521 --> 18:50.771
It probably already has.

18:50.772 --> 18:53.223
I saw this, episode...

18:57.511 --> 18:58.946
All right.

18:58.947 --> 19:00.464
I'm doing this.

19:00.465 --> 19:02.566
I am going over there.

19:10.141 --> 19:12.826
Wish me luck.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.216
<i>Kids, nothing in this life
quite compares to the sweet,</i>

19:19.217 --> 19:22.219
<i>terrifying exhilaration
of making your move.</i>

19:22.220 --> 19:25.589
<i>When you just put it all
on the line and go for it.</i>

19:25.590 --> 19:28.859
<i>And that night, by golly,</i>

19:28.860 --> 19:31.094
<i>Cindy went for it.</i>

19:46.094 --> 19:50.180
<i>So no, kids,
that girl wasn't your mother.</i>

19:50.181 --> 19:52.282
<i>She ended up being
someone else's mother.</i>

19:52.283 --> 19:54.501
<i>In fact, they both did.</i>

20:04.128 --> 20:05.578
Like I said,

20:05.579 --> 20:06.964
she's here on a date.

20:06.965 --> 20:09.266
<i>So that was not the
day I met your mother.</i>

20:09.267 --> 20:13.020
<i>The day I met your mother
was the day of a wedding.</i>

20:13.021 --> 20:14.587
Okay, maybe I'm
a little nervous.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.056
Dude, it's just
a wedding toast.

20:16.057 --> 20:19.026
I know. I just... I want
it to be great, you know?

20:19.027 --> 20:21.028
I want this whole
day to be great.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.613
It will be.

20:22.614 --> 20:23.647
Best man?

20:23.648 --> 20:24.648
You're being summoned.

20:24.649 --> 20:26.283
Geez, what now?

20:26.284 --> 20:29.620
Ted, seriously, relax.
Everything's...

20:29.621 --> 20:30.821
Okay, and it's raining.

20:30.822 --> 20:32.072
Yeah. You were saying?

20:32.073 --> 20:34.374
You didn't happen to bring
an umbrella, did you?

20:34.375 --> 20:36.326
No. I didn't
bring an umbrella.

20:42.833 --> 20:45.668
I mean, everyone told us that
it might take a while, but...

20:45.869 --> 20:48.404
We thought we might be
the exception to the rule.

20:49.305 --> 20:51.306
Anyways, we're getting
back on that horse.

20:51.307 --> 20:54.343
I mean, feeling good
about the future.

20:56.879 --> 20:58.597
Obviously, this goes
without saying,

20:58.598 --> 21:00.816
but you won't tell Lily
about any of this, right?

21:00.817 --> 21:02.585
No! Of course! Absolutely!
