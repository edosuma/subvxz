"Mama Can You Hear Me?"
Closed captioned

00:02.001 --> 00:02.920
Previously on 90210...

00:03.044 --> 00:04.964
You cheated on her.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.966
No, I didn't. Okay,
Holly snuck in and attacked me.

00:07.090 --> 00:07.925
Naomi walked in
before I could push her away.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.051
Oh, my God.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.762
Naomi, I told you,
I didn't cheat on you.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.681
I believe you,
about Holly, I do.

00:13.806 --> 00:14.890
It's just that

00:15.015 --> 00:18.686
it doesn't matter because
I know that I need to change,

00:18.811 --> 00:21.981
and it doesn't have anything
to do with you.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.565
SILVER:
Is everything okay
with your dad?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.192
NAVID:
He's turning himself in.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.568
With what he has on my uncle,
they're both going away

00:26.694 --> 00:28.570
for a long time. Now that
everything's out in the open,

00:28.696 --> 00:29.196
I was hoping we
could start over.

00:29.321 --> 00:32.533
I'm still seeing Greg.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.159
You know that song of
mine that you sampled?
Yeah.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.620
It's about my daughter, Maisy.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.288
Do you know it's been
almost three years

00:38.413 --> 00:39.790
since I gave her away?

00:39.915 --> 00:42.292
It is so nice to
finally meet you.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.127
SILVER:
She has your eyes.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.462
GREG:
Thanks, but she's adopted.
The birth mother

00:45.587 --> 00:47.506
was a local girl
still in high school,

00:47.631 --> 00:49.383
and she just wanted her baby
to go to a good home.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.384
That's how we got Maisy.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.136
Vanessa was there the
night of the accident.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.805
She's been here
every day since.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.265
ANNIE: Vanessa said
that a black car hit you,

00:57.391 --> 00:59.643
but the mechanic said that

00:59.768 --> 01:02.187
your bike was covered
in maroon paint.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.271
Yes. Help, please.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.190
There's been an accident.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.275
It was a hit-and-run.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.320
I have decided
to go to Carnegie Mellon.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.824
Here is to fresh starts.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.826
Oh, this isn't my I.D.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.118
Uh...
WOMAN:
Is it someone you know?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.747
Clare Hallenberg.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.874
No. I don't know her.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.635
(country music playing)

01:33.761 --> 01:35.763
(groans, sighs)

01:39.725 --> 01:41.810
(crying)

01:41.936 --> 01:44.312
Somebody kill me, please!

01:48.525 --> 01:50.819
This is the soundtrack
to my nightmares.

01:50.945 --> 01:54.281
Hey, hey, hey, as a freeloader,
I know I can't complain,

01:54.406 --> 01:56.157
but Austin has been playing

01:56.283 --> 01:58.744
that broken-hearted country crap
for a week.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.412
Ah, the poor guy--
he hasn't been the same

02:00.537 --> 02:01.080
since Naomi broke up
with him.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.581
(door opening)

02:07.002 --> 02:08.336
Hey, buddy.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.725
Yu--

02:26.855 --> 02:29.232
No, he did not just finish
my Oaty Nuts!

02:29.357 --> 02:30.233
Guys, we have to do
something, okay?

02:30.358 --> 02:31.735
It is not right for someone

02:31.860 --> 02:32.611
to stew
in their sadness like this.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.113
I don't think
that dude has taken a shower

02:34.237 --> 02:35.614
in more than a week.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.573
(sighs)

02:36.698 --> 02:39.034
You know what?
Maybe I should just leave

02:39.159 --> 02:41.161
for a little while until
he starts feeling better.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.622
Yeah, maybe I should find
another couch to sleep on, too.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.248
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.584
You guys aren't going to leave
me here alone with him, are you?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.878
Dixon, my heart was
just broken, okay?

02:50.004 --> 02:52.673
And I was just beaten
within an inch of my life.

02:52.798 --> 02:57.136
My constitution cannot handle
this level of country music.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.720
Okay, I know he's my roommate,

02:58.846 --> 03:01.056
and he's my responsibility,

03:01.180 --> 03:03.851
so, I'll-I'll go
handle him, okay?

03:03.976 --> 03:06.269
(scoffs)

03:10.816 --> 03:13.152
Hey, Austin?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.528
(groaning)

03:17.196 --> 03:18.657
(clearing throat)

03:20.199 --> 03:21.785
Dude, you have become
such a workaholic.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.163
My new boss makes
The Devil Wears Prada chick

03:24.287 --> 03:25.539
look like a
kindergarten teacher.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.666
Well, that might have something
to do with the fact

03:27.791 --> 03:29.626
that you got caught
having sex with a sailor

03:29.751 --> 03:32.004
in a giant snow globe at a party
that you were supposed

03:32.129 --> 03:33.212
to be overseeing.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.422
Hey, I have learned my lesson,

03:34.548 --> 03:35.716
and I'm never gonna let a guy

03:35.841 --> 03:37.300
come between me
and my success again.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.594
Unlike some people--
(coughs) Annie.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.513
What are you saying?
That I'm letting Liam get

03:41.638 --> 03:43.891
in the way of my life?
That's crazy.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.767
Oh, then why are you still here?

03:45.893 --> 03:46.267
I mean, seriously,
don't we have some big

03:46.393 --> 03:48.436
going-away party for you?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.772
All we're saying is,
if you're here to stay close

03:50.898 --> 03:52.107
to your ex-boyfriend and his
new girlfriend, that's weird.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.109
What about the fact

03:54.234 --> 03:55.652
that she hasn't left his side
since the accident?

03:55.777 --> 03:58.030
Or that her wallet
was full of fake I.D.'s?

03:58.155 --> 04:00.407
Oh, a girl with a fake I.D.
Shocker.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.242
I'm serious, guys.
It's creepy.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.827
IVY:
Yeah, you know what?

04:03.952 --> 04:04.494
You going through another
girl's purse

04:04.619 --> 04:06.121
kind of makes you
the creepy one.

04:06.246 --> 04:06.914
(gasps)

04:07.039 --> 04:08.498
God...
Ooh...

04:08.623 --> 04:11.793
Shoot.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.294
I hope those
weren't for my mom.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.172
She hates sloppiness.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.589
It's all right, Holly.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.591
I'm sure it was
just an accident.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.804
That was an
accident, too.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.681
Yeah, you know what?
I really don't feel

04:24.806 --> 04:25.933
like witnessing
a murder this morning.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.976
Your move, sweetie.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.188
Um...

04:31.312 --> 04:33.273
I can't believe you let her
get away without a severe limp.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.442
Oh, following my old impulses

04:35.567 --> 04:37.444
for revenge never
got me anywhere.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.446
That's why I'm looking
for a fresh start.

04:39.571 --> 04:43.366
Which is not going to happen
if I engage in petty rivalries.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.160
I don't think
Holly got the memo.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.494
Doesn't matter.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.705
The new Naomi is about
turning the other cheek.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.497
But she stole
your boyfriend.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.125
'Cause she thinks
I stole her mother.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.001
Oh, my God, that's it.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.419
Holly is Holly

04:54.544 --> 04:56.880
because of the relationship
she has with her mother.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.591
If I fix things between them,
then I won't have to deal

04:59.716 --> 05:02.970
with a nemesis on campus,
I'll probably get a promotion,

05:03.095 --> 05:04.888
and then being New Naomi
will be super easy!

05:05.013 --> 05:07.474
Finito!

05:07.599 --> 05:09.143
Well, I hope
you're right.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.019
'Cause you can't keep
turning the other cheek forever.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.687
You're going
to run out of cheeks.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.109
(gasps, laughs)
Hey.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.486
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.655
You know that agency
I just signed with?
Yeah.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.448
Just got me my dream gig.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.241
Nick, that's amazing.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.867
I'm going to Afghanistan.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.869
Whoa! Where you going?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.288
Afghanistan.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.915
It's a combat
photojournalism assignment.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.875
You're looking
at the next Robert Capa.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.294
Who?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.336
He's the greatest war
photographer of all time.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.672
My personal hero.
Oh.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.300
I didn't know
your hero is a war photographer.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.511
Oh, he was till he was
blown up by a land mine in 1954.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.471
Which would then make him dead.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.973
Hey, there's worse things
in life.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.432
Like not following your passion.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.852
Don't worry.
I'll be fine, okay?

05:51.977 --> 05:54.104
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you tonight.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.563
Bye.
Bye.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.110
That place was awesome.
Yeah.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.820
You know, sometimes I forget
there's a whole world

06:01.945 --> 06:04.823
outside my little
campus cocoon.
Yeah, I figured

06:04.948 --> 06:07.784
you must get so tired of running
into the same students

06:07.909 --> 06:09.368
and people
you know all the time.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.871
Yeah, being a lit teacher--

06:10.996 --> 06:12.664
it's kind of like
being a rock star.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.625
Must be how I got a table
for tonight at Chez Paris.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.794
Ooh, how fancy.
What's the occasion?

06:17.919 --> 06:20.463
Well, soft-shell
crabs are in season.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.798
Oh, and I'm divorced.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.509
Believe me, it's a huge
relief for the both of us.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.385
And we've even agreed to
share custody of Maisy.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.890
You don't really have
to tell me that stuff.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.766
You know, your family situation
is-is your business.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.311
Well, maybe I'd like to
make it your business.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.937
My ex wants to
move to Connecticut,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.898
and it got me thinking--

06:38.023 --> 06:39.691
my contract with CU
is up this semester.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.902
I've got an offer from
Columbia University

06:42.027 --> 06:45.197
for a tenure track position,
and I'm considering it...

06:45.322 --> 06:47.282
if you'll come with me.

06:47.406 --> 06:50.827
Wait.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.913
Are you asking me
to move to New York?

06:53.955 --> 06:55.749
I understand.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.293
Yeah, it's a, it's a
bigger change for you.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.045
Um, our relationship
is new,

07:00.170 --> 07:01.963
and you have
friends here, so...

07:02.089 --> 07:03.965
No, no-- you're right,
I would miss my friends,

07:04.091 --> 07:07.426
but, look, if a relationship
with you means

07:07.552 --> 07:10.805
leaving them behind, then...

07:10.931 --> 07:13.100
New York, here I come.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.685
Really?
(giggles)

07:15.810 --> 07:17.145
If I knew this
stupid food truck

07:17.271 --> 07:18.980
was on the other
side of the planet,

07:19.106 --> 07:19.606
I might have worn
different shoes.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.067
Look, this is the best
Tex-Mex in L.A., okay?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.736
Step one in my plan
to make Austin feel better.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.614
The GPS says
it's, like, 27 yards away,

07:27.739 --> 07:29.908
but I don't see it.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.618
Whoa, okay.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.827
What?
Uh, don't freak out,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.372
but over there is Silver
with New Guy, okay?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.415
Let's just keep walking.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.958
Remember what happened
at the fashion show.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.459
No, no, no, no, I refuse to
be a crazy ex-loser-boyfriend

07:39.584 --> 07:41.586
like Hopalong Sad Boy
back there.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.630
No, Silver and I
can be friends.

07:43.755 --> 07:44.798
Greg.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.883
Hey.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.636
I just want to let you know
that we're 100% cool.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.554
You know, I don't want
there to be any

07:51.679 --> 07:56.101
old boyfriend-
new boyfriend weirdness.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.394
Glad to hear it.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.395
Wait a minute.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.313
Have we met?

08:00.939 --> 08:01.815
You look really familiar.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.942
We gotta go.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.238
Well,

08:08.363 --> 08:09.114
so much for you
and Silver

08:09.239 --> 08:11.074
being friends, yeah?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.367
Well, I couldn't
have been nicer.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.618
That wasn't easy,
considering how badly

08:13.743 --> 08:18.790
I want to stab him
in the face with a fork.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.625
VANESSA:
Coffee?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.339
Ooh... (laughs)

08:25.464 --> 08:27.299
(both moan happily)

08:28.716 --> 08:29.426
Ooh...

08:29.550 --> 08:31.636
I like that one.
When'd you get it?

08:31.761 --> 08:34.639
Uh, that is a long
and boring story.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.140
(chuckles)
Hmm.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.477
Maybe... (sighs)

08:38.601 --> 08:40.061
but I still want to hear it.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.395
I want to know
everything about you.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.148
(laughs)

08:43.273 --> 08:45.692
Well, I'm not that interesting.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.236
You know what? We should
take a trip together.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.446
Best way to get
to know someone

08:49.570 --> 08:50.364
is by traveling
with them.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.491
Oh.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.074
I'll think about it.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.285
That's a maybe.

08:55.410 --> 08:55.869
Maybe's good.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.871
(chuckles)

08:59.622 --> 09:01.500
Hey.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.043
Annie.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.627
(clears throat)

09:04.752 --> 09:05.879
I thought you, uh, left
for Carnegie Mellon.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.299
I was going to, but the semester
had already started,

09:09.424 --> 09:11.551
and I had too many loose ends
to tie up in L.A.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.222
So what can I do for you?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.557
Um...

09:17.682 --> 09:20.727
Well, I, I just came by
for Dixon, actually.

09:20.852 --> 09:21.769
He, he really wants to read

09:21.895 --> 09:23.271
Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance,

09:23.397 --> 09:25.148
and I know you have a copy.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.776
Yeah, man, uh, it's
in a box somewhere.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.614
I'll see if I can find it.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.741
ANNIE:
Great.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.582
I thought you might be looking
for this... Clare.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.420
Liam never mentioned
you were a klepto.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.505
I accidentally took
the wrong purse

09:48.629 --> 09:50.631
because we have
the same one, remember?

09:50.757 --> 09:53.843
Yeah, I guess we have the
same taste in a lot of things.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.096
(scoffs)

09:56.221 --> 09:58.432
Look, I don't know which one of
those I.D.'s is the real you,

09:58.557 --> 10:00.892
but I do know
that you are a liar.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.852
Oh, well, that's
one thing you know.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.438
Now here's another.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.730
You're messing with
the wrong girl.

10:05.855 --> 10:10.068
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.861
(scoffs)
You can't win.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.321
You can only get hurt.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.367
Well, Liam is the only one
who I am worried

10:17.492 --> 10:19.411
about getting hurt,
which is why

10:19.536 --> 10:22.581
I'm not telling him
about any of this

10:22.705 --> 10:25.625
as long as you do
the best thing for everyone

10:25.750 --> 10:28.336
and go back to wherever
the hell you came from.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.173
Stay away from Liam.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.051
Found it.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.219
Great.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.971
Dixon will be
so happy.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.099
You guys have a nice day.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.187
Awards season is the Super Bowl

10:46.313 --> 10:48.731
of the Beverly Hills
event planning business.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.191
I've got three parties
in one night,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.110
so it's all hands on deck.

10:52.235 --> 10:52.902
Absolutely, you
can count on me.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.862
I know I can,

10:54.988 --> 10:58.199
which is why I'm about to give
you a very big assignment.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.161
Now, it's all top secret,

11:01.286 --> 11:03.871
but the American Film Critics
Society is honoring

11:03.997 --> 11:06.583
Mitchell Nash with Performer
of the Year tomorrow night.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.376
Seriously?
I'm in love with that guy.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.379
Yes, well,
you and half the world.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.465
Let's stay professional,
shall we?

11:13.590 --> 11:14.382
Yes, of course, I'm sorry.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.509
Just... Mitchell Nash.
Wow.

11:15.634 --> 11:18.011
Okay, so I'll be popping
back and forth

11:18.136 --> 11:20.221
with all my events,
so I'm going to need you

11:20.347 --> 11:21.973
to be point on this one.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.141
Can you handle that?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.601
HOLLY:
Mom...

11:24.725 --> 11:26.353
are we going to go
to lunch or what?

11:26.478 --> 11:27.395
I've been...

11:27.521 --> 11:28.813
out in the lobby for
a half hour already.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.441
Well, sweetheart,
Naomi and I are still working.

11:31.566 --> 11:32.651
I know that's
a foreign concept for you.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.820
Rachel...
Mm-hmm.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.198
you said you need all hands
on deck tomorrow night.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.324
Yes.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.159
Maybe Holly could work
the party, too.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.413
Ooh, I don't think
that's the best idea.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.789
Oh, really, what a shock.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.542
I thought all of Naomi's ideas
are brilliant.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.210
I'm sure she'll do a great job.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.380
Besides, you're her mother-- she
has event planning in her DNA--

11:53.505 --> 11:55.423
and I could really use the help.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.468
Okay.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.761
If it means
that much to you.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.848
Congratulations, Holly,
you're Naomi's new assistant.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.475
Her what?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.768
Uh, assistant?
Tha-That's not what I meant.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.771
Well, she's your idea,
so she's your responsibility.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.649
Now, sweetheart,
let's make this a short lunch.

12:12.773 --> 12:16.444
I'm sure Naomi has a lot
of work for you to do.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.864
Great, I work
for you now.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.825
(sighs)

12:22.950 --> 12:25.078
Guess you got
your revenge after all.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.689
Oh, my God, I swear I have
never seen you work this hard.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.148
You said that yesterday.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.317
Yeah, well, I'm still
getting used to it.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.070
I have to run this huge
Hollywood awards party tonight,

12:59.195 --> 13:01.489
and I brilliantly convinced
my boss

13:01.615 --> 13:03.074
to hire my archnemesis
as my assistant.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.075
Whoa-whoa-whoa--

13:04.200 --> 13:06.244
Holly is your new assistant?

13:06.703 --> 13:09.414
What is that, some sort
of death wish or something?

13:09.539 --> 13:12.292
I was trying to do the right
thing and it bit me in the ass.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.336
So, is this a big event
with, like, a whole

13:15.462 --> 13:16.879
red carpet and
everything?

13:17.004 --> 13:19.382
Yes, movie stars,
TV stars, models.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.883
Oh, my God, I have
a stomachache.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.177
Hey, by any chance,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.054
do you need a photographer
for the event?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.055
Not me-- um,

13:26.180 --> 13:27.390
I'm actually asking about Nick.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.726
I would just really love
for him to get a job

13:29.850 --> 13:31.060
that's actually in town,
and he's really...

13:31.185 --> 13:32.562
Yeah, he's hired.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.647
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

13:33.772 --> 13:34.564
Oh, that's amazing.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.775
On one condition--
he has to get a shot

13:36.899 --> 13:38.067
of me with Mitchell Nash.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.402
Okay, I'm sure that
will not be a problem.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.820
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.618
Here you go.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.537
I picked up the name tags
from the printer

13:49.663 --> 13:50.913
and I got you a cup of coffee

13:51.038 --> 13:53.541
that I didn't even
spit in... boss.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.627
Thank you.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.129
Now I need you to seal all
the gift cards into envelopes.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.381
How stupid
do you think I am?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.759
I am not licking
booby-trapped envelopes.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.302
They're self-adhesive,

14:04.427 --> 14:05.970
and, Holly, we have
to trust each other

14:06.095 --> 14:07.263
if we're gonna be
working together.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.433
Is that why you won't take
a sip of the coffee?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.979
(sighs)

14:15.104 --> 14:16.439
(anxious laugh)

14:21.444 --> 14:22.903
I lied about the spit.

14:24.197 --> 14:28.909
Holly, look...

14:29.035 --> 14:31.037
your mother thinks that you
have a sense of entitlement.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.747
Don't you want a chance
to prove her wrong?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.583
Don't you want to show her
what you're capable of?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.377
My mother does have
a pretty low opinion of me,

14:37.502 --> 14:40.129
but I'm sure she knows
I can stuff an envelope.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.256
Okay, fine, fine, what if
I gave you a bigger job?

14:42.382 --> 14:42.923
Would you trust me then?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.551
I'm listening.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.386
I want you to go to
the hotel tonight,

14:46.511 --> 14:47.554
pick up Mitchell Nash,

14:47.679 --> 14:49.138
and bring him directly
to the red carpet.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.223
Why would you give up
your chance

14:50.348 --> 14:51.432
to hang out
with a movie star?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.517
Because, once your mom sees

14:52.642 --> 14:54.101
how you handle the talent,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.020
she'll finally get a sense
of what you're capable of.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.271
Why do you care
what my mother thinks of me?

14:57.397 --> 14:58.898
Because I'm trying
to be a good person,

14:59.023 --> 15:00.567
but you keep
getting in my way.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.986
And I'm your boss, so stop
asking so many questions.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.035
Hey, brother, can I get two
beers over here, please?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.370
You know
I don't drink, right?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.121
They're both for me.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.456
Do you really think
drinking is going

15:15.582 --> 15:17.667
to help you get
over the breakup?

15:17.792 --> 15:18.918
That's what I've
been trying to tell him.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.546
Dix, I know you think
it's your job to cheer me up,

15:21.671 --> 15:22.714
but it's not.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.132
Okay, you're just my roommate.
This isn't on you,

15:25.258 --> 15:27.260
so just stay out of my way
and let me handle my heartbreak

15:27.385 --> 15:28.762
the way a real man should--

15:28.887 --> 15:30.597
by getting drunk off my ass
and feeding the pelicans.

15:30.722 --> 15:31.556
Feeding the...

15:35.059 --> 15:38.187
Whoa, uh, Annie, uh,
w-what's going on?

15:38.312 --> 15:39.522
Uh, just looking for Liam.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.692
Okay, um, look, I'm
going to tell you this

15:42.817 --> 15:44.193
out of love, okay?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.986
You got to let Liam go.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.782
You don't want to end up like
Austin, desperately clinging

15:48.907 --> 15:51.033
onto a dead relationship.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.660
I promise you, I'm fine.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.455
(sighs)
Good, good,

15:55.580 --> 15:56.790
'cause trying to cheer
up heartbroken people

15:56.915 --> 15:58.583
is exhausting.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.834
(laughs)

15:59.959 --> 16:01.001
Hey, how's it going?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.462
Good, good.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.213
Uh, so, have you seen
Vanessa anywhere?

16:04.338 --> 16:05.882
She took off
pretty quickly.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.967
I didn't get a
chance to ask where.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.009
How's Liam?

16:09.135 --> 16:10.177
Did he take it okay?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.679
He seemed fine.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.598
He was pretty excited to be
going out of town with her.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.726
Wait, what?

16:16.851 --> 16:18.728
Vanessa left with Liam?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.856
They took off a little while
ago on his motorcycle.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.065
(sighs)

16:23.190 --> 16:25.443
Annie, are you okay?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.407
ANNIE: I have to find out
where they went.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.408
Try to remember.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.868
Annie, you need
to calm down, okay?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.745
Vanessa did not force
Liam to go with her.

16:35.870 --> 16:36.496
He seemed pretty excited.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.122
Yeah, but that's
because he has

16:38.247 --> 16:39.833
no clue what he's
dealing with.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.584
I need to find him.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.336
I found multiple I.D.'s
in her purse, okay?

16:43.461 --> 16:45.212
Vanessa is not even
her real name.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.508
Okay, is a fake I.D.
really such a big deal?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.009
It's more than that.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.302
When I took his motorcycle in
to get fixed,

16:51.427 --> 16:52.887
the mechanic said
he found

16:53.012 --> 16:54.722
maroon paint
all over his bike.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.766
Vanessa drives
a maroon car,

16:56.891 --> 16:59.101
so maybe she was the hit-and-run
driver, all right?

16:59.226 --> 17:02.188
Why did she lie and why
is she still hanging around?

17:02.313 --> 17:03.857
Well, maybe there's
a good explanation.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.108
We all have a past, right?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.319
I mean, if you Googled me,
you'd crap yourself.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.446
You're right.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.532
She said I have no clue
who I'm dealing with.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.450
I should do my homework.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.076
Annie, wait.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.538
Okay, maybe
Vanessa is trouble.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.873
But what if
you're wrong?

17:19.998 --> 17:21.875
If you're still
hung up on Liam

17:22.000 --> 17:26.671
and she's not chopping him
up into pieces somewhere,

17:26.796 --> 17:28.965
you'll push him away
further than ever.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.312
Okay, I'm sorry, this is
incredible-- are you kidding me?

17:43.437 --> 17:45.023
Never in my life did I think
I was actually gonna be standing

17:45.189 --> 17:46.106
anywhere near a red carpet.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.316
Yeah, it's, it's
good, I guess.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.192
I didn't realize you
were so into this thing.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.277
Uh, uh, check it out--

17:50.403 --> 17:53.322
girl who won the reality show
where they eat live rats.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.666
Naomi, everything
looks great.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.167
I want to thank you
for all of your hard work.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.169
Don't thank me yet.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.755
Did you pick up
Mitchell Nash?

18:08.880 --> 18:09.756
I sent Holly.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.131
Holly?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.383
You, you...
She'll be here
any minute.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.011
This is a very big night
for my company,

18:15.135 --> 18:17.680
and you're risking all
to make peace with Holly?

18:17.805 --> 18:19.640
You know, you need
to understand that there are

18:19.766 --> 18:21.893
some relationships that are
just not worth the trouble.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.895
Oh! Finally!

18:24.020 --> 18:26.439
Where is he?

18:26.564 --> 18:28.315
HOLLY: I went to the hotel,
and they said

18:28.441 --> 18:29.984
Mitchell Nash wasn't
staying there.
Well, of course not.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.403
Do you think he stays
under his own name?
Oh, my God,

18:32.528 --> 18:34.321
I forgot to give Holly
Mitchell's fake name.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.032
Look, stop covering
for her, Naomi.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.157
I know my daughter.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.492
She's never learned
responsibility

18:38.618 --> 18:39.827
because she never had to,

18:39.953 --> 18:43.831
but you do, so fix it-- now.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.920
(country music playing)

18:58.429 --> 19:00.306
Are you kidding me?

19:00.431 --> 19:02.100
Now you?
Shh.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.143
It's strangely soothing.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.728
(chuckles)
Okay.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.063
(lowers volume of music)

19:07.187 --> 19:08.522
Well, I got
Lee's orange chicken.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.649
I hope it's still
your favorite.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.775
Yes, now and forever.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.360
Wow, you really do know
how to make me feel better.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.403
(both chuckle)
Thanks.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.280
I mean, a lot
of things change,

19:16.405 --> 19:19.533
but you can always count
on Lee's orange chicken.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.619
Thanks.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.123
I really am glad
we're friends again.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.624
Me, too.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.877
I mean, after everything
we've been through,

19:30.003 --> 19:31.921
it's kind of
unbelievable.

19:32.046 --> 19:33.923
Yeah, breakup,
the whole Silver thing.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.383
Being a pregnant teenager
when it just ruins your life

19:36.509 --> 19:37.885
and doesn't get you
a reality show.

19:38.011 --> 19:38.886
Yeah, well, you seem like you're
in a much better place.

19:39.012 --> 19:39.971
(laughs)

19:40.096 --> 19:41.931
I really am.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.600
I mean, whenever I get sad
about giving away Maisy,

19:44.725 --> 19:47.061
I just try to imagine
this little three-year-old

19:47.186 --> 19:48.562
with a happy family.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.856
Me, too.

19:49.981 --> 19:54.610
I couldn't have gotten through
it all without friends,

19:54.735 --> 19:56.154
especially without you.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.615
(sighs)

19:59.740 --> 20:01.492
You should go talk to Silver.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.538
What am I gonna do--
go up to her house and try

20:05.663 --> 20:07.707
to convince her how important
it is to be friends?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.962
Nah, 'cause what
if it's too late?

20:13.087 --> 20:16.298
I mean, it's never too
late to get it all back.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.176
Look at us.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.597
(country music playing)

20:29.896 --> 20:31.147
Dude, you do not
need another beer.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.399
You're absolutely right.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.651
I need ten.

20:35.776 --> 20:39.113
Look, I know what you're
going through, okay?

20:39.238 --> 20:42.241
Last year I
was with Ivy.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.242
Things were going great,

20:43.367 --> 20:46.079
and then some
crazy English dude

20:46.204 --> 20:47.997
with his pants all rolled
up to his knees came

20:48.122 --> 20:49.623
and sabotaged
the relationship

20:49.749 --> 20:51.458
just to get revenge
on Ivy's mom.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.087
Look, I lost

20:54.212 --> 20:56.130
a girl that I really,
really cared about,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.840
all because of some evil jerk.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.051
What did you do?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.468
Punched him in the face.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.345
Whew!
It felt so sweet.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.100
I could never punch a girl
in the face, though...

21:07.225 --> 21:08.308
even Holly.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.770
Well, maybe you don't have to.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.190
I got a better plan.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.486
Thanks.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
All right, it's not
a real road trip until you have

21:22.073 --> 21:23.532
a beach dog.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.533
(chuckles)

21:24.658 --> 21:26.035
You okay?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.246
Mm.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.038
Can I be honest with you?

21:29.163 --> 21:31.082
Beats lying to me.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.458
(laughs)

21:32.583 --> 21:34.585
I'm sorry, I'm joking.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.089
Well, you said you wanted
to get to know me.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.548
Maybe one of the reasons
I've been holding back

21:39.673 --> 21:41.134
is because I don't think
things are over

21:41.259 --> 21:43.136
with you and Annie.

21:43.261 --> 21:45.638
I told you, Annie and I
talked, and it's over.

21:45.763 --> 21:46.555
It's in the past.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.348
Well, the past has
a way of coming back

21:48.474 --> 21:50.184
whether we want
it to or not.

21:50.309 --> 21:50.851
Not for me.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.895
(sighs)

21:53.020 --> 21:54.981
Look, this is the
relationship I want to be in.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.149
If there's something
standing in the way of that,

21:56.274 --> 21:57.650
you need to tell me.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.777
No.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.530
I need to show you.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.576
(knocking on door)

22:09.495 --> 22:11.497
Uh, Silver
isn't here.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.666
She ran out to pick
up some dinner.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.918
Oh, okay, well...

22:16.043 --> 22:17.837
She should be back soon, so
if you want to wait inside...

22:17.962 --> 22:18.712
Yeah.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.300
I'm sorry about how awkward
it was yesterday.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.385
I... hope I didn't
freak you out.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.470
No, not at all.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.848
But Silver
seemed pretty upset.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.308
Yeah, I noticed.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.643
Breakups are hard.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.646
Yeah, tell me about it.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.522
Yeah, I just got divorced.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.149
Oh.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.608
Yeah, but yesterday-- it
wasn't all your fault.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.319
We were talking about
moving to New York.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.611
I think running
into her ex

22:42.736 --> 22:46.991
at that moment was
just the final straw.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.617
Oh, you're, you're moving
to New York together?

22:48.742 --> 22:52.330
Uh, you know, I should let
Silver tell you.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.248
No, no, it's cool,
I mean...

22:54.372 --> 22:57.043
(chuckles) By now, you and I
are practically old friends.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.294
Uh...

22:58.418 --> 23:00.171
I know this might
sound crazy,

23:00.296 --> 23:02.380
but I'm, I'm sure
we met before.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.720
Hey, what are
you doing here?
(phone ringing)

23:10.681 --> 23:11.849
It's my three-year-old.

23:11.974 --> 23:15.144
Yeah, not only does she know
how to use cell phones,

23:15.269 --> 23:16.729
but she has the all-time
high score on that, uh,

23:16.854 --> 23:17.938
the bird game.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.606
Hi, Maisy.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.901
(Silver chuckles)
Aw, I miss you too.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.825
(whispering):
Maisy?

23:35.331 --> 23:37.666
Navid, we need to talk.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.003
About you dating the guy
who adopted Adrianna's baby?

23:41.128 --> 23:42.796
I can date whoever
I want to date.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.590
D-Does he know
that you're friends

23:44.715 --> 23:46.424
with the biological mother
of his child?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.135
Ade and I are not friends.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.388
Okay, but you cannot be
in her child's life

23:50.512 --> 23:52.181
and not tell her, Silver.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.683
Maisy is not her responsibility.

23:54.808 --> 23:58.104
She gave her up
for adoption, remember?

23:58.229 --> 23:59.730
Look, this isn't even about Ade.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.400
It's about you not being
able to come to terms

24:02.524 --> 24:03.943
with the fact
that I have moved on.

24:04.068 --> 24:04.944
No, that's not true.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.528
I just think
you should be honest.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.489
Oh, you want to
talk about honesty?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.617
It was your lies that ruined
our relationship, Navid.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.620
And I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.914
But you can make
a different choice, Silver.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.791
Tell Greg and Adrianna
the truth.

24:18.916 --> 24:22.211
I'm not going to let
some random coincidence

24:22.336 --> 24:24.588
get in the way
of my relationship with Greg.

24:24.713 --> 24:25.881
Oh, and what am
I supposed to do?

24:26.006 --> 24:28.217
No, I-I know you and I have
been through so much together,

24:28.342 --> 24:31.637
but I still care about Ade.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.348
Well, I guess you have
a decision to make, too,

24:34.472 --> 24:36.309
'cause if you
really want to be

24:36.434 --> 24:38.852
my friend, you'll stay
the hell out of it.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.156
Nice chatting.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.537
Uh, a-absolutely.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.832
I mean, I, I, I don't even have
to think about it, uh...

24:59.957 --> 25:01.250
It was a pleasure.
Yeah.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.293
Count me in, absolutely.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.543
Great, great
meeting you.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.379
Hey.
Hey.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.422
Fun party, huh?

25:06.546 --> 25:08.424
Uh, it is now-- that
was Mike Strater.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.176
He is a documentary
filmmaker.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.593
Right, right, he made
that amazing film

25:11.718 --> 25:12.470
about the, um,
the Japanese earthquake.

25:12.594 --> 25:14.305
Right?
Yeah.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.890
He's making a film next year
about the genocide in Rwanda.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.185
He asked me to come along and
be his still photographer.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.311
Wow.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.812
That's incredible, right?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.606
I mean, this party wasn't
a waste of time after all.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.150
A waste of time?

25:26.275 --> 25:28.444
I'm sorry, I had to pull
a lot of strings with Naomi

25:28.568 --> 25:29.736
just to get you this job.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.155
I mean, this is
an amazing gig.
Yeah, I know,

25:31.280 --> 25:32.448
it was so sweet
of you, but, look,

25:32.572 --> 25:33.615
you know me well
enough to know

25:33.740 --> 25:35.701
that this kind of
party is not my thing.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.911
Not your thing.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.915
Okay, well, you know what's
not exactly my thing, Nick?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.459
Waiting around
by the phone to find out

25:43.583 --> 25:45.794
whether my boyfriend's been
killed in some war zone.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.634
(car sputtering)

25:52.759 --> 25:54.136
Okay.

25:55.429 --> 25:56.847
Aah... oh...!

25:56.972 --> 26:00.518
(gasping)

26:04.646 --> 26:06.106
That car...

26:06.232 --> 26:07.649
Sucks, I know.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.735
My mom says if I want
something nicer,

26:09.860 --> 26:11.153
I have to earn the
money to buy it myself.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.154
She hates me.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.571
She doesn't hate you.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.324
She wants to push you
to be great like she is.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.658
Yeah, by buying
me a car

26:16.783 --> 26:19.078
that has to be rolled
down a hill to start?

26:19.203 --> 26:20.204
Okay, you know what?

26:20.329 --> 26:21.914
My parents bought me
everything I ever wanted,

26:22.039 --> 26:23.707
and they didn't give
a crap about me.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.000
Your mother actually
cares about you,

26:25.125 --> 26:28.754
and that... turd on wheels
is her way of saying,

26:28.879 --> 26:32.883
"I love you, Holly,
you can accomplish anything."

26:33.008 --> 26:34.552
(scoffs)

26:38.472 --> 26:40.598
Sorry.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.395
NAOMI:
Excuse me.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.812
Hi, we were told

26:45.938 --> 26:49.442
this is where we could
find Napoleon Schoenberg.

26:49.567 --> 26:50.776
Oh, thank God.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.445
Mr. Schoenberg
is by the pool.

26:52.570 --> 26:53.779
Can you please get him
out of here

26:53.904 --> 26:56.073
before he drinks
that, too?

26:56.198 --> 26:56.782
Thank you.

26:56.907 --> 27:00.244
♪ ♪

27:04.081 --> 27:05.623
(gasps)

27:06.666 --> 27:09.002
Go.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.463
Hello, girls.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.340
Can I buy you a drink?

27:13.466 --> 27:15.008
You are both over 18, right?

27:15.134 --> 27:17.094
Just asking.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.636
Actually, Mr. Nash...

27:18.762 --> 27:20.847
We're here to take you
to the awards show.

27:22.558 --> 27:26.353
Well, you took your bloody
time about it, didn't you?

27:26.479 --> 27:28.855
I may have had three drinks
while I was waiting for you.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.525
Oh!

27:31.649 --> 27:33.777
Oh, okay, okay.

Well, this is it.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.009
Well, the house isn't much,

27:57.134 --> 27:59.761
but the tire collection in the
front yard is pretty impressive.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.848
(chuckles)

28:02.973 --> 28:06.810
I have to tell you something,
and I'm afraid if I do,

28:06.935 --> 28:09.771
you're not going to look
at me the same way again.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.107
Vanessa, you can tell me
anything.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.902
I'm the one who hit you that
night on the motorcycle.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.447
(wry laugh)

28:18.572 --> 28:20.032
What?

28:20.157 --> 28:23.118
Look, I wanted to tell
you, but I was so scared.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.953
You lied to the police.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.580
You told 'em it was
a hit-and-run.
I had to.

28:26.704 --> 28:29.166
I've been in trouble
with the law before,

28:29.291 --> 28:31.502
and if they knew what
I did or who I was...

28:31.627 --> 28:33.504
Wait, so you're on the run
from the police,

28:33.629 --> 28:35.506
you almost killed me,
and you, you, what,

28:35.631 --> 28:36.507
brought me here
to finish the job?

28:36.632 --> 28:38.050
No, I want to tell
you the truth.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.218
Yeah, well, it's
a little late for that.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.219
Liam, wait.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.220
ANNIE:
Hey!

28:41.345 --> 28:43.805
Get away from him!

28:43.930 --> 28:45.683
Annie, what the hell are
you doing here?

28:52.939 --> 28:55.984
Annie, what the hell are you
doing here? How did you find us?

28:56.109 --> 28:57.277
I used
the GPS tracking

28:57.403 --> 28:58.987
on your motorcycle.

28:59.112 --> 28:59.863
What?

28:59.988 --> 29:01.657
Liam, I Googled her, okay?

29:01.781 --> 29:03.367
Not only did she lie
about the hit-and-run driver,

29:03.492 --> 29:05.327
but she also has
a criminal record.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.954
I needed to make sure
you were okay.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.873
I saved his life that night.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.166
Clearly I'm not
trying to kill him.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.334
Really?

29:12.459 --> 29:14.253
'Cause when I told you
to get out of town,

29:14.378 --> 29:15.546
she dragged you
out here.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.339
Who knows what
she was going to do?

29:17.464 --> 29:18.632
(sighs)

29:18.757 --> 29:22.511
I brought you out
here because...

29:22.636 --> 29:24.388
this is where I grew up.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.974
Yeah.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.226
My parents didn't want me,

29:29.351 --> 29:32.396
so I bounced around
until I wound up here.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.898
And because I was in
trouble with the law,

29:35.023 --> 29:37.693
when I hit you that night,
I had to lie.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.570
But I couldn't just run away.

29:39.695 --> 29:40.779
I had to make sure
you were okay.

29:40.904 --> 29:43.365
That's why I stayed with
you in the hospital.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.158
Plus, it didn't
really seem

29:45.284 --> 29:47.411
like you had
anyone else anyway.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.332
You should have
told me the truth.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.461
I've done a lot of
things that I regret,

29:55.586 --> 29:57.671
and I can't change

29:57.796 --> 30:01.174
where I'm from or
what I've done,

30:01.300 --> 30:03.051
but I'm trying to
start a new life.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.724
Somehow the past just
keeps coming back.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.684
Look,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.853
if that's a deal breaker...

30:13.979 --> 30:15.939
I get it.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.074
I don't know what to say.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.034
I know. She's crazy.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.286
I'm talking about you.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.913
You Internet-stalked
Vanessa and you tracked me?

30:32.038 --> 30:33.165
That's nuts.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.459
You heard what she said,
Liam-- she lied.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.252
Because she's
trying to move on.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.045
So that makes it
okay with you?

30:39.171 --> 30:41.840
No...

30:41.965 --> 30:43.383
Look, you were right
about the accident.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.344
I appreciate
your concern.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.846
I'm pissed that she lied,
but everybody's got stuff

30:47.971 --> 30:48.847
they're trying
to leave behind.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.725
Like us?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.644
I'm sorry.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.771
I couldn't just sit back

30:55.895 --> 30:57.564
and wait for something
terrible to happen.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.693
Yeah, well, I can
take care of myself.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.736
You're not my responsibility
anymore, Annie.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.905
And I'm not yours.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.341
Whoo!
(laughs)

31:24.466 --> 31:25.884
Come on.
(both clucking)

31:26.009 --> 31:28.470
Boom!

31:28.595 --> 31:31.515
Ha-ha! See?
Eggs and toilet paper.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.350
That's how we cure
a heartache where I'm from.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.560
Through vandalism?

31:34.685 --> 31:37.103
Ah, a good rain and
it'll all wash away.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.271
Besides, how
do you feel?

31:38.397 --> 31:40.566
Man, I feel great.
I feel great.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.567
Thanks, man.

31:41.692 --> 31:42.818
No, no, no, no, seeing

31:42.942 --> 31:44.695
"Holly eats doody"
in shaving cream

31:44.820 --> 31:46.613
on her sorority house--
that's all the thanks I need.

31:46.739 --> 31:47.865
Well, hey, we got
one more egg left.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.242
Do you think I can hit
Holly's window from here, huh?

31:50.367 --> 31:51.117
Uh...

31:52.494 --> 31:54.037
Well, considering
your current drunken state,

31:54.162 --> 31:56.456
I would say no, but it's
always worth a try, so, uh...

31:56.582 --> 31:57.082
All right, buddy.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.459
Come on, let's go.

32:00.753 --> 32:04.005
What the hell kind
of egg was that?

32:04.130 --> 32:05.340
Dude, that was a rock.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.760
Come on, let's go.

32:07.885 --> 32:10.512
(crowd cheering)

32:11.555 --> 32:13.557
NAOMI:
Oh.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.479
(chuckles)
Honestly, ladies...

32:19.605 --> 32:20.898
I can take it from here.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.649
Okay...

32:22.775 --> 32:24.192
(Naomi and Holly gasp)

32:24.317 --> 32:25.694
Is everything
okay here?

32:25.819 --> 32:28.280
Yes, uh, Mitchell is
just really exhausted

32:28.405 --> 32:29.281
from his
international flight.

32:29.406 --> 32:30.574
Uh-huh.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.868
♪ Oh, Danny Boy... ♪

32:32.992 --> 32:34.119
Okay, well, let's go.

32:34.244 --> 32:35.370
Go, go, go.
Come on.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.038
We're walking,
we're walking.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.624
I'm letting go,
that's right.
Come on.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.041
No, we're
still walking.
Come on.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.042
(vomits)

32:41.167 --> 32:43.086
Oh, oh, n-no.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.087
RACHEL:
Oh, please.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.089
Really? Really?

32:46.214 --> 32:50.009
Seriously?
(gasps)

32:50.135 --> 32:52.638
How was I supposed to know
that he was going to be wasted

32:52.763 --> 32:53.931
because we showed up
a little late?

32:54.055 --> 32:55.515
Well, open a magazine.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.059
Everybody knows he's the biggest
party animal in Hollywood.

32:58.184 --> 33:01.396
Why do you think I wanted Nash
to be personally brought here

33:01.521 --> 33:03.022
instead of riding in a limo?

33:03.148 --> 33:04.065
Think, Holly.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.275
(both talking at once)

33:05.400 --> 33:06.276
Rachel...

33:06.401 --> 33:07.068
don't blame Holly.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.570
You put me in charge.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.905
It's my responsibility.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.783
Yes, you gave her one task--
one-- and she failed.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.493
It's probably my fault--
I guess I spoiled her--

33:14.618 --> 33:17.913
but whatever the reason,
Holly always drops the ball.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.122
No, you don't give Holly
enough credit.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.206
(scoffing laugh)

33:20.332 --> 33:22.876
She is head
of the Greek Council,

33:23.001 --> 33:24.878
she's president of
her sorority house.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.922
She's relentless
and unforgiving.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.424
She works hard for everything
she wants, just like you.

33:29.549 --> 33:33.345
She's not afraid
of anything, except you.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.851
You were right
when you said I wanted you

33:38.976 --> 33:40.978
to hire her for the sake
of a relationship,

33:41.102 --> 33:42.270
but it was
your relationship with her

33:42.395 --> 33:44.272
that I was trying to save.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.692
RACHEL:
Well...

33:46.817 --> 33:49.235
you made your point.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.614
I appreciate your honesty,
and you're right--

33:52.739 --> 33:56.785
Holly screwed up, but
the buck stops with you,

33:56.910 --> 33:58.996
so you're fired, Naomi.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.719
Hey, mind
if I join you?

34:14.844 --> 34:17.681
Don't think I'm the best
of company right now.

34:17.806 --> 34:18.764
Perfect.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.685
Same here.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.771
Listen, sorry if I
kind of ganged up on
you

34:24.897 --> 34:26.690
about the whole Liam
thing the other day.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.025
I mean, for the record,

34:28.149 --> 34:29.609
I don't actually think
you're crazy.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.822
Ah, well, you obviously haven't
heard about how I used the GPS

34:33.947 --> 34:36.658
tracking system on his
motorcycle to hunt him down

34:36.783 --> 34:38.827
in the middle of nowhere and
attack his new girlfriend.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.786
Oh, my God, you're crazy.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.664
I can't believe
what I did.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.290
Yeah, but
you know what?

34:44.416 --> 34:46.418
You can't beat yourself up
about that.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.085
I mean, you care about the guy,

34:48.210 --> 34:49.588
and you were obviously just
trying to protect him.

34:49.713 --> 34:52.215
And instead
I just pushed him away.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.717
Yeah, I kind of did
the same thing with Nick.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.220
He got this amazing job shooting
in a war zone,

34:57.345 --> 34:58.722
and I pretty much pulled

34:58.847 --> 35:00.599
the most passive-aggressive
move possible,

35:00.724 --> 35:02.225
just to get him to stay.

35:02.350 --> 35:07.522
I guess we just have to let the
people we love live their lives.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.483
And all we can really do
is be there for them

35:10.609 --> 35:12.444
when it all comes crashing down.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.869
♪ ♪

35:29.461 --> 35:30.754
Hey, there.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.756
(sighs)

35:32.881 --> 35:33.966
You see the blogs?

35:34.091 --> 35:35.467
What do we got?

35:35.592 --> 35:39.846
"A Puke-Studded Gala"
was my favorite.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.765
(laughs)

35:41.890 --> 35:43.266
But close second would be

35:43.391 --> 35:45.268
"Night of a Thousand Chunks."

35:45.393 --> 35:46.436
(laughs)

35:49.606 --> 35:51.399
You have no idea
how grateful I am

35:51.524 --> 35:53.359
for what you did
for me tonight.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.694
My mom and I talked

35:54.820 --> 35:56.446
for a long time,
and I can't remember

35:56.571 --> 35:57.447
the last time we did that.

35:57.572 --> 36:01.367
I knew you two girls
would work it out.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.162
She gave me a job
at the company.
Mm...

36:04.287 --> 36:06.748
Of course, she said if I screw
up again, she'll fire me

36:06.873 --> 36:08.249
and cut me out of her will.

36:08.374 --> 36:10.460
I'm sure you'll do great.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.296
Good to see one of us
still has a job.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.590
Mm! About that.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.050
Mitchell sobered up
after a bit

36:17.175 --> 36:18.259
and we actually had
a pretty good time.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.512
Don't even think about it.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.014
You're not gonna date
some movie star guy

36:22.139 --> 36:23.056
who parties like that!
Are you crazy?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.933
No, no, no, never.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.185
But guys who party like that
throw very big parties,

36:27.310 --> 36:28.979
and he was very impressed
with the event

36:29.104 --> 36:30.730
and the event planner.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.732
(chuckles)

36:32.858 --> 36:34.192
Next time Mitchell Nash
throws a party,

36:34.317 --> 36:35.360
my mom's gonna be

36:35.485 --> 36:37.362
pretty pissed someone else got
the job.

36:37.487 --> 36:39.072
This is huge, Holly.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.616
I mean, maybe I could start
my own business or something.

36:41.741 --> 36:45.745
Yeah, I guess
you're gonna be pretty busy.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.040
Looks like I have to get
a new arch-nemesis.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.209
Oh, my God, don't worry, I'm
sure she's out there somewhere.

37:03.889 --> 37:07.059
Hey,
I thought you left already.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.894
What a night, huh?

37:09.019 --> 37:11.188
I got a crotch shot of
one of the Hilton sisters.
Oh!

37:11.312 --> 37:11.938
Maybe it was a Kardashian.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.606
(chuckles)

37:13.732 --> 37:15.233
More importantly,
does it matter?

37:15.358 --> 37:16.818
Nick, I'm sorry.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.529
I mean, this is obviously not
at all your type of gig,

37:19.654 --> 37:21.907
and I should never
have asked you to do it.

37:22.032 --> 37:25.994
Yeah, well, even though shouting
"Snooki, look over here!"

37:26.119 --> 37:29.622
was soul-crushing, it means
a lot to me that you care.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.416
Well, I do.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.459
I really do care.

37:33.585 --> 37:34.586
And you know, even if it sucks

37:34.711 --> 37:38.090
to think about you off
in... in some war zone,

37:38.215 --> 37:39.799
I mean, I'm not

37:39.925 --> 37:41.218
gonna get in the way
of you and your dreams.

37:41.342 --> 37:44.429
So go to Afghanistan.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.224
And take incredible photos,

37:47.348 --> 37:49.559
have an adventure,

37:49.684 --> 37:52.020
just, you know, try not to die.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.231
I'll try.

38:10.413 --> 38:11.831
Good morning.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.041
(Dixon chuckles)

38:13.166 --> 38:15.127
How you feeling?

38:15.252 --> 38:16.878
Like I got bucked
off a horse

38:17.003 --> 38:18.588
and landed headfirst...

38:18.713 --> 38:21.382
but it was worth it.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.260
I had a great time
last night, man.

38:23.384 --> 38:24.510
I owe you.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.680
And I didn't wake up
to country music.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.141
It's a beautiful thing.
(chuckles)

38:31.977 --> 38:34.437
Dix, listen, I appreciate
everything you did for me,

38:34.562 --> 38:36.689
trying to cheer me up.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.650
You know, you're right.
We're not just roommates.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.777
I consider you a friend.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.906
Hey, well, back at you, man.

38:54.291 --> 38:55.959
Oh, my God.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.169
Hmm?

39:01.756 --> 39:04.342
AUSTIN:
Burned to the ground?

39:12.142 --> 39:13.351
(groans)

39:13.476 --> 39:16.813
Good morning!
Good morning.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.148
(chuckles)
Thank you.

39:18.273 --> 39:18.606
You're welcome.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.774
I'm gonna need this

39:19.899 --> 39:20.984
to get through
the rest of my day.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.236
Is everything okay?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.030
I just couldn't sleep is all.

39:25.155 --> 39:27.032
A lot on my mind.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.492
Oh, no! Did the conversation
with Silver not go well?

39:29.617 --> 39:32.037
No.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.955
We had a pretty big fight,
actually.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.165
About what?

39:35.290 --> 39:38.001
Mm.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.961
Navid, come on.
You can tell me anything.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.754
I'm your friend, right?

39:45.383 --> 39:48.136
You are my friend.

39:48.261 --> 39:51.681
I'm done letting secrets get in
the way of my relationships.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.394
Adrianna, I have
to tell you something.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.565
You might want
to sit down for this.
