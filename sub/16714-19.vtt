00:01.135 --> 00:02.300
Stop!

00:02.302 --> 00:03.769
My shipment's coming through,

00:03.771 --> 00:05.771
and you're gonna make
sure it get to me safely.

[Reid gasps]

00:09.493 --> 00:11.126
Help!

00:11.128 --> 00:13.529
Today's the day you're supposed to
move Frasier's stuff, isn't it?

00:13.531 --> 00:14.530
Maybe I just won't do it.

00:14.532 --> 00:16.533
You know why they killed Delgado
instead of you?

00:16.533 --> 00:18.200
That was me protecting you.

00:18.202 --> 00:19.868
There's only so far I can go.

00:19.870 --> 00:21.403
So can I.

00:21.405 --> 00:23.005
Reid: There's a helplessness in here

00:23.007 --> 00:26.041
that causes people to do things
they would never consider.

00:26.043 --> 00:29.545
I'm starting to think like them,
starting to survive like them.

00:29.547 --> 00:31.113
[Coughing]

00:31.115 --> 00:32.781
Malcolm! You ok?

00:32.783 --> 00:34.183
They made me try it.

00:34.185 --> 00:35.251
What happened?

00:35.253 --> 00:36.652
Bad batch.

00:36.654 --> 00:38.320
Medic, cell block “C,” now.

00:38.322 --> 00:40.089
Medic, cell block “C”.

00:40.091 --> 00:41.790
[Alarm sounds]

00:43.928 --> 00:48.348
Reid: No one in here is honest.

00:48.799 --> 00:52.768
Rossi: They could
just be numb to it all.

00:52.770 --> 00:54.503
Well, I'm not.

00:54.505 --> 00:57.439
You never will be.

00:57.441 --> 01:00.462
Because you're a good person.

01:01.479 --> 01:04.146
That's the difference.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.482
Hey, you wanted to see me?

01:06.484 --> 01:08.284
Tara, come on in.

01:08.286 --> 01:09.418
Uh, what's up?

01:09.420 --> 01:11.053
I need you to go to the prison tomorrow

01:11.055 --> 01:13.856
and conduct another
cognitive interview on Reid.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.563
Mr. Scratch. Where?

01:21.565 --> 01:23.799
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, last week.

01:23.801 --> 01:25.567
A former associate of mine down there

01:25.569 --> 01:27.670
on business recognized him.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.805
I... this is huge.

01:29.807 --> 01:31.373
This puts Scratch in Latin America.

01:31.375 --> 01:32.741
And increases the likelihood

01:32.743 --> 01:34.343
he passed through Mexico at some point.

01:34.345 --> 01:36.378
That's why this cognitive
is so imperative.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.114
It is critical that
Reid remember exactly

01:39.116 --> 01:41.350
what happened in that
motel room in Mexico.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.185
Can I play devil's
advocate here for a second?

01:43.187 --> 01:44.320
Absolutely.

01:44.322 --> 01:45.688
Let's say the cognitive works,

01:45.690 --> 01:48.557
all right, and Reid puts
Scratch in that motel room,

01:48.559 --> 01:50.793
100%, no doubt about it.

01:50.795 --> 01:52.094
What changes?

01:52.096 --> 01:53.595
I mean, isn't he just another prisoner

01:53.597 --> 01:54.830
proclaiming his innocence?

01:54.832 --> 01:56.498
Tell her your idea.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.334
What changes is I can then petition

01:58.336 --> 02:00.235
the DOJ and the counter-terrorism center

02:00.237 --> 02:02.671
to put Scratch on a
high-priority watch list.

02:02.673 --> 02:03.772
How?

02:03.774 --> 02:05.441
By massaging the definition

02:05.443 --> 02:07.209
of international terrorist.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.744
Now, that photo proves that Scratch

02:08.746 --> 02:11.680
is crossing borders from
one country to another.

02:11.682 --> 02:14.183
And we already know
he's targeting the FBI.

02:14.185 --> 02:16.118
I don't know, it
sounds like a hard sell.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.538
Well, I talked to one
of my contacts at the NSA

02:18.550 --> 02:19.988
and she said they would be on board

02:19.990 --> 02:22.524
if we give them something
tangible on Scratch.

02:22.526 --> 02:24.059
I'm going to London tonight

02:24.061 --> 02:25.761
to pursue this with my
former colleagues at Interpol.

02:25.763 --> 02:28.731
Ok, I'll... I'll give it
my best shot with Reid.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.166
Tara, there's one more thing.

02:31.168 --> 02:33.202
The prison is on full lockdown,

02:33.204 --> 02:34.403
but I got you an exemption

02:34.405 --> 02:35.871
from the no-visitors rule.

02:35.873 --> 02:37.573
How'd you manage that?

02:37.575 --> 02:40.860
Medical necessity.

02:40.978 --> 02:43.645
You are a doctor, right?

02:43.647 --> 02:48.417
I have earned a doctorate degree, yes.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.687
M.D., ph.D.
Now's not the time to split hairs.

02:51.689 --> 02:54.056
Tomorrow, Reid is your patient,

02:54.058 --> 02:56.825
so go in there and act doctorly.

02:56.827 --> 02:59.595
I will make sure to pack my stethoscope.

04:56.569 --> 04:57.769
so let's get started.

04:57.771 --> 04:59.037
What have you got, Penelope?

04:59.039 --> 05:00.438
What we've got is some awfulness,

05:00.440 --> 05:01.973
awfulness so awful that it made me

05:01.975 --> 05:03.408
temporarily forget about
the whole Reid awfulness.

05:03.410 --> 05:04.842
I miss him.

05:04.844 --> 05:08.146
Ok, yesterday afternoon
in the Saguaro Wilderness,

05:08.148 --> 05:10.114
which is just east of Tucson, Arizona,

05:10.116 --> 05:11.983
an old-timer out rock hounding

05:11.985 --> 05:15.486
stumbled upon... This.

05:16.556 --> 05:19.424
And this.

05:19.426 --> 05:21.559
And also this.

05:21.561 --> 05:23.027
They were all together?

05:23.029 --> 05:25.663
Yeah. Within like 50 feet of each other.

05:25.665 --> 05:26.998
The staging of the bodies

05:27.000 --> 05:28.633
has the feel of a crucifixion.

05:28.635 --> 05:30.735
Could this be the work
of a religious fanatic?

05:30.737 --> 05:33.237
Rossi: The desert does attract
its share of nut jobs.

05:33.239 --> 05:34.605
Don't forget the Manson family

05:34.607 --> 05:36.975
got their training
wheels out in the Mojave.

05:36.977 --> 05:38.710
What's... what's that around their neck?

05:38.712 --> 05:40.778
- Shock collars.
- Rossi: Torture?

05:40.780 --> 05:42.447
Doubtful. There weren't
any batteries in them.

05:42.449 --> 05:43.881
So the collars are symbolic,

05:43.883 --> 05:45.350
a signature.

05:45.352 --> 05:47.151
They're all wearing something
over their shoulders.

05:47.153 --> 05:49.320
Yeah, it was just some
sort of blue, silky fabric.

05:49.322 --> 05:51.656
Well, their bodies are badly decomposed.

05:51.658 --> 05:53.424
Looks like they've been there a while.

05:53.426 --> 05:54.892
Rossi: Preliminary M.E. report did say

05:54.894 --> 05:57.996
the 3 victims are in separate
stages of decomposition.

05:57.998 --> 06:00.298
So he's killing them
one by one over time,

06:00.300 --> 06:03.201
but now his disposal
site has been discovered.

06:03.203 --> 06:06.104
Why do I get the feeling
that's not going to stop him?

06:06.106 --> 06:08.539
Because it won't. Not
with another thousand miles

06:08.541 --> 06:10.575
of desert nearby for him to set up shop.

06:10.577 --> 06:12.910
Ok, we've got a lot of ground to cover.

06:12.912 --> 06:14.979
Let's hit it.

You can conduct your
interview in here, Dr. Lewis.

06:21.621 --> 06:23.421
- It's secure.
- Thank you.

06:23.423 --> 06:24.589

stays away from me right now.

I'm here about Scratch.

06:51.451 --> 06:54.519
Walker thinks he might have a new way

06:54.521 --> 06:56.954
to find him, but to do so, I need to

06:56.956 --> 06:59.590
walk you through another cognitive.

06:59.592 --> 07:00.892
I understand what you're doing,

07:00.894 --> 07:03.061
and I really appreciate it, but I...

07:03.063 --> 07:04.629
Emily already tried and it didn't work.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.697
That was over a month ago.

07:06.699 --> 07:08.766
You were still under the influence.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.935
As you know, distance from the incident

07:10.937 --> 07:14.338
can sometimes yield additional insights.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.874
When's the last time you slept?

07:16.876 --> 07:18.439
I don't know,

07:18.439 --> 07:20.363
which is why I don't really have
the energy to do this right now.

07:20.363 --> 07:22.814
Well, exhaustion's not
necessarily a bad thing.

07:22.816 --> 07:24.615
If your resistance is down,

07:24.617 --> 07:27.885
you might be more
receptive to the cognitive.

07:27.887 --> 07:29.620
Ok?

07:29.622 --> 07:32.090
Ok.

[Beeping]

07:40.467 --> 07:42.333

07:42.335 --> 07:44.535

07:44.537 --> 07:48.439
Ok, Carol Brandom, Oscar Benitez,

07:48.441 --> 07:51.809
and Peter Jones, all in their early 20s.

07:51.811 --> 07:54.078
Each one had just
returned to the Tucson area

07:54.080 --> 07:56.214
after attending college out of state.

07:56.216 --> 07:58.883
Exceptional students, graduated
at the top of their class.

07:58.885 --> 08:01.586
And all three had been
featured separately

08:01.588 --> 08:04.722
in local media, hometown
kids done good sort of thing.

08:04.724 --> 08:06.691
The public exposure
must be what put them

08:06.693 --> 08:08.259
on the unsub's radar.

08:08.261 --> 08:10.728
So, Walker, you talked about
the crucifixion element earlier.

08:10.730 --> 08:12.864
Apparently, there is
a quasi-religious cult

08:12.866 --> 08:14.065
not too far away.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.466
Garcia: Yeah, I already
checked into that.

08:15.468 --> 08:16.634
I know I'm not the profiler here,

08:16.636 --> 08:18.102
but they didn't do it.

08:18.104 --> 08:19.704
What makes you so sure?

08:19.706 --> 08:23.274
Because that cult is
so respectful of life...

08:23.276 --> 08:25.476
Ok, they don't eat carrots

08:25.478 --> 08:27.512
because they grow in the earth.

08:27.514 --> 08:29.714
I practice non-violence
with my food choices,

08:29.716 --> 08:31.582
but that's a whack-a-doodle.

08:31.584 --> 08:33.150
Luke, when we land, why don't you and JJ

08:33.153 --> 08:34.552
go to the crime scene?

08:34.554 --> 08:36.020
Stephen, see what's new with the M.E.

08:36.022 --> 08:37.655
I'll set up with local law enforcement

08:37.657 --> 08:40.158
and talk to the victims' families.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.592
Maybe the three of
them had a common enemy

08:42.595 --> 08:45.429
that we don't know about.

08:50.703 --> 08:52.303
Pima County sheriff's department

08:52.305 --> 08:53.905
has jurisdiction on any homicide

08:53.907 --> 08:55.640
inside the national park.

08:55.642 --> 08:57.108
Also, park police will be assisting.

08:57.110 --> 08:58.876
No, we look forward to working with you.

08:58.878 --> 09:01.946
Our killer couldn't do all of this
without a vehicle.

09:01.948 --> 09:04.015
Have you seen any tire tracks, sheriff?

09:04.017 --> 09:05.683
No, but it gets pretty windy up here.

09:05.685 --> 09:07.084
So if there were any tracks,

09:07.086 --> 09:08.352
they wouldn't have lasted.

09:08.354 --> 09:10.121
And you said there
were empty water bottles

09:10.123 --> 09:11.689
found in front of each of the bodies?

09:11.691 --> 09:14.859
That's right. Hopefully
we can pull some DNA.

09:16.529 --> 09:19.597
All right, so all the bodies

09:19.599 --> 09:22.800
were positioned in that direction.

09:22.802 --> 09:25.136
These boulders in front of the victims,

09:25.138 --> 09:27.038
they've all been moved recently.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.072
How can you tell?

09:28.074 --> 09:29.640
Because the side facing up

09:29.642 --> 09:32.677
has less weather exposure
than the side facing down.

09:32.679 --> 09:34.312
That's where we found the water bottles,

09:34.314 --> 09:35.646
next to all the rocks.

09:35.648 --> 09:37.915
The killer moved these.
He's a strong guy...

09:37.917 --> 09:39.250
Or had help.

09:39.252 --> 09:41.052
Ok, it's like he rolled up

09:41.054 --> 09:43.621
a front-row seat to
watch the executions.

09:43.623 --> 09:46.357
Kick back, enjoy a cold bottle of water,

09:46.359 --> 09:48.859
and watch your victims
slowly bake to death.

09:48.861 --> 09:50.461
Yeah, that's not a good sign.

09:50.463 --> 09:51.796
Our unsub isn't just killing,

09:51.798 --> 09:54.665
he's savoring every minute of it.

10:01.207 --> 10:04.075
So you can't determine the
C.O.D. for any of the victims?

10:04.077 --> 10:05.843
Afraid not.

10:05.845 --> 10:07.712
Got a long list of
what they didn't die of.

10:07.714 --> 10:09.780
No bullet or stab wounds,

10:09.782 --> 10:11.649
no evidence of blunt force trauma

10:11.651 --> 10:12.950
or asphyxia.

10:12.952 --> 10:14.518
- Toxicology?
- Clean.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.188
They were neither drugged nor poisoned.

10:17.190 --> 10:19.323
What's left? Dehydration?

10:19.325 --> 10:20.925
Most likely.

10:20.927 --> 10:23.361
In that heat, it wouldn't take long.

10:23.363 --> 10:24.595
Hours, not days.

10:24.597 --> 10:25.963
Do we have a time of death?

10:25.965 --> 10:28.332
The first victim, roughly a month.

10:28.334 --> 10:31.502
Second victim, around two weeks.

10:31.504 --> 10:34.472
Last victim, less than a week.

10:34.474 --> 10:37.174
Syncs up with when family
members reported them missing.

10:37.176 --> 10:39.176
So bottom line is, we may never know

10:39.178 --> 10:40.745
for certain what caused the deaths

10:40.747 --> 10:42.079
of these 3 young people.

10:42.081 --> 10:43.714
Afraid not.

10:43.716 --> 10:45.816
There's a saying around here

10:45.818 --> 10:48.319
that the desert does
not give up her secrets.

10:48.321 --> 10:51.055
This may be one of them.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.126
Lewis: Are you there?

10:55.128 --> 10:56.460
Reid: Yes.

10:56.462 --> 10:58.396
Tell me what you see.

11:00.099 --> 11:02.500
She's waiting for me.

11:02.502 --> 11:03.801
Nadie Ramos.

11:03.803 --> 11:06.337
Is she alone?

11:06.339 --> 11:08.339
Yes.

11:08.341 --> 11:10.174
She seemed upset.

11:10.176 --> 11:12.677
And we were standing by a window.

11:12.679 --> 11:15.880
Was there somebody there?

11:15.882 --> 11:17.415
Mm-hmm.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.317
Who is it, Spencer?

11:19.319 --> 11:20.918
Think.

11:25.658 --> 11:27.658
Uhh!

11:29.462 --> 11:32.563
I don't know. I blacked out.

11:33.599 --> 11:36.167
It's ok. It's all right.

11:36.169 --> 11:38.069
What happens when you wake up?

11:41.140 --> 11:44.542
[Nadie screams]

11:44.544 --> 11:46.010
[Nadie screams]

11:46.012 --> 11:47.912
She's struggling. Nadie was struggling.

11:47.914 --> 11:49.780
Because the other man is stabbing her.

11:49.782 --> 11:52.083
- [Screaming]
- Yeah.

11:52.085 --> 11:55.086
And I think that I should try CPR,

11:55.088 --> 11:56.854
but there's just so much blood.

11:56.856 --> 11:58.823
My heart's beating fast.

11:58.825 --> 12:01.826
And it feels like I'm
moving in slow motion.

12:01.828 --> 12:04.995
Wait. Something's wrong.

12:04.997 --> 12:08.766
There's a knife...

12:08.768 --> 12:10.868
And blood.

12:10.870 --> 12:12.803
Who has the knife?

12:14.006 --> 12:15.873
It's in my hand.

12:15.875 --> 12:16.974
I'm bleeding.

12:16.976 --> 12:20.411
Ok. Because you cut your hand.

12:28.688 --> 12:30.654
It all goes blank after that.

12:32.492 --> 12:34.759
That's about how far you got with Emily.

12:34.761 --> 12:37.061
You're psychologically blocking

12:37.063 --> 12:38.929
whatever happens next.

12:39.999 --> 12:41.031
Why?

12:41.033 --> 12:42.500
I'm not sure.

12:42.502 --> 12:44.802
Uh, why don't we take a short break.

12:44.804 --> 12:47.438
Yeah? Ok.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.942
So Oscar Benitez was
the one who initially

12:51.944 --> 12:53.844
set the unsub off.

12:53.846 --> 12:55.212
I wonder why.

12:55.214 --> 12:57.314
I watched the piece
the local TV channel did

12:57.316 --> 12:58.649
on him last month.

12:58.651 --> 12:59.850
He was a hard-working kid.

12:59.852 --> 13:02.286
Humble background, got a scholarship.

13:02.288 --> 13:04.088
He was the first one in
his family to go to college.

13:04.090 --> 13:05.489
All three were like that.

13:05.491 --> 13:07.758
Each one came home to
give back to the community,

13:07.760 --> 13:09.827
help make a better
life for their parents

13:09.829 --> 13:11.796
and people who helped them.

13:11.798 --> 13:14.465
That might have thrown more
salt in the unsub's wound.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.333
We should have Garcia see if

13:16.335 --> 13:18.836
other returning graduates
got any type of publicity.

13:18.838 --> 13:20.771
If so, they should be
in protective custody.

13:20.773 --> 13:22.006
That's a good idea.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.607
Rossi: Thanks.

13:23.609 --> 13:26.577
Same DNA found on all 3 water bottles,

13:26.579 --> 13:27.778
but no hits in CODIS.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.346
Our unsub isn't in the system.

13:29.348 --> 13:31.348
What do you make of the shock collars?

13:31.350 --> 13:33.517
They're used to train dogs.

13:33.519 --> 13:35.519
I mean, maybe the unsub is
trying to make a statement

13:35.521 --> 13:38.155
about conformity and obedience.

13:38.157 --> 13:40.291
Cookie-cutter universities churning out

13:40.293 --> 13:41.492
cookie-cutter students.

13:41.494 --> 13:43.394
Alvez: Yeah, something like that.

13:43.396 --> 13:44.995
It could explain the fabric

13:44.997 --> 13:46.864
draped over their shoulders,

13:46.866 --> 13:49.333
mocking the valedictorian sash

13:49.335 --> 13:51.235
each of them wore at their graduation.

13:51.237 --> 13:54.972
If the unsub's disapproving,
envious, or both.

13:54.974 --> 13:58.375
Envy is one thing, roasting
people to death is another.

13:58.377 --> 14:01.445
So what tipped him?

14:09.255 --> 14:11.455
[Man crying]

14:11.457 --> 14:13.924
Please, don't! Please!

14:15.495 --> 14:17.595
I'll... I'll do whatever you want.

14:17.597 --> 14:20.431
Please, don't.

14:21.734 --> 14:23.968
I'll do whatever you want. Please.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.203
[Sobbing] Please.

14:26.205 --> 14:31.308
Please, Ben. Please, don't.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.711
You don't have to do this. Please.

14:33.713 --> 14:35.880
[Gasping]

14:35.882 --> 14:37.681
Please, don't.

14:37.683 --> 14:40.184
[Sobbing]

14:43.423 --> 14:44.507
Please.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.706
Name's Joey Fletcher.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.841
Couple of dirt bikers found him.

14:57.843 --> 14:59.710
Alvez: 10 miles from
the other crime scene,

14:59.712 --> 15:01.211
but the M.O.'s the same.

15:01.213 --> 15:04.181
Dog collar, blue cloth,
and the water bottle.

15:04.183 --> 15:07.184
He dragged another rock up close again.

15:07.286 --> 15:08.652
It's half full.

15:08.654 --> 15:10.120
Maybe our guy was in a hurry this time.

15:10.122 --> 15:12.957
Yeah, the victim is
staged to face north,

15:12.959 --> 15:15.025
just like the others.

15:15.127 --> 15:17.161
[Beeping]

15:17.163 --> 15:18.696
Hmm.

15:18.698 --> 15:20.130
What's up?

15:20.132 --> 15:21.231
It's true north.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.533
Sheriff: Which means?

15:22.535 --> 15:24.868
True north is geographically accurate,

15:24.870 --> 15:27.237
unlike magnetic north.

15:27.239 --> 15:30.507
So he's trying to get his bearings?

15:30.509 --> 15:34.611
I hate to say it, but he's
got his bearings just fine.

15:34.613 --> 15:36.480
Let's head back.

15:48.794 --> 15:51.261
Man: Mom!

15:51.263 --> 15:53.665
Mom?

15:58.838 --> 16:00.771
Why didn't you answer?

16:01.173 --> 16:03.608
What's that?

16:07.513 --> 16:09.079
It's for you.

16:09.081 --> 16:10.814
[Scoffs]

16:10.816 --> 16:14.485
Whose grave did you steal those off of?

16:14.487 --> 16:17.888
I... I didn't steal it.

16:17.890 --> 16:22.359
I made it myself for... For you.

16:22.361 --> 16:24.028
These flowers, every one of them,

16:24.030 --> 16:26.063
they're all native to Hawaii.

16:26.065 --> 16:29.066
See?

16:29.068 --> 16:31.869
It's a lei.

16:36.776 --> 16:39.643
They grow fake flowers
over there in Hawaii?

16:39.645 --> 16:42.746
They don't sell the real ones here.

16:44.650 --> 16:47.317
And they're expensive, but...

16:47.319 --> 16:50.687
In the future, when
we go there, we can...

16:50.689 --> 16:53.223
Oh, stop with the future talk!

16:53.225 --> 16:54.625
I can't take it no more.

16:54.627 --> 16:56.293
The future's right here.

16:56.295 --> 16:57.895
I'm sitting in it.

16:57.897 --> 17:00.564
I'm gonna live and
die and rot right here

17:00.566 --> 17:02.399
in this hell hole!

17:02.601 --> 17:05.435
[Scoffs] Hawaii.

17:05.438 --> 17:06.970
Who's gonna make that happen?

17:06.972 --> 17:09.606
Not your useless father,

17:09.608 --> 17:12.742
wherever the hell
that son of a bitch is.

17:12.744 --> 17:14.944
I'll take you there,

17:14.946 --> 17:16.579
like I promised I would.

17:16.582 --> 17:20.818
You? With all your millions in the bank?

17:28.727 --> 17:31.128
[Door closes]

17:38.237 --> 17:41.505
We've got our first
deviation of victimology.

17:41.507 --> 17:44.541
Joey Fletcher flunked out
of college first semester.

17:44.543 --> 17:46.043
No job, either.

17:46.045 --> 17:48.245
His girlfriend said he spent his days

17:48.247 --> 17:50.848
playing video games and smoking weed.

17:50.850 --> 17:53.817
So why did the unsub
shift from overachievers

17:53.819 --> 17:56.019
to a stoned slacker?

17:56.021 --> 17:57.488
We've disrupted his routine.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.590
Could have forced him
to be less selective.

17:59.592 --> 18:02.092
The unsub starts choosing
his victims at random.

18:02.094 --> 18:04.561
Our job just got a lot tougher.

18:04.563 --> 18:06.530
We need to give the profile.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.700
Rossi: The person we're looking for

18:09.702 --> 18:12.402
is a physically fit male
in his early to mid-20s.

18:12.404 --> 18:14.538
Despite his youth, he's intelligent,

18:14.540 --> 18:16.540
and criminally-sophisticated.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.942
Because of his familiarity
with the surrounding desert,

18:18.944 --> 18:21.945
we believe he is a local
who owns or has access

18:21.947 --> 18:23.780
to a vehicle that can
navigate rough terrain.

18:23.782 --> 18:26.083
JJ: Until the most
recent victim, his targets

18:26.085 --> 18:28.118
have been those who
excelled at university.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.154
If the killer was an academic failure,

18:30.156 --> 18:32.122
this could be his way of lashing out.

18:32.124 --> 18:34.992
Alvez: Aspects of his
ritual support this theory.

18:34.994 --> 18:36.727
Walker: And all the
victims were positioned

18:36.729 --> 18:39.196
to face geodetic, or true north.

18:39.198 --> 18:41.632
It's a geographic term,
but we think the unsub

18:41.634 --> 18:44.101
is using it more in
a philosophical sense.

18:44.103 --> 18:46.303
It's likely that he works a menial job,

18:46.305 --> 18:47.704
something below his abilities.

18:47.706 --> 18:49.173
The final victim represented

18:49.175 --> 18:51.175
a dramatic shift in victimology.

18:51.177 --> 18:53.644
Academically, Joey Fletcher was a bust.

18:53.646 --> 18:55.345
So the killer's starting to lose focus.

18:55.347 --> 18:58.582
Rossi: He may actually
be refining his mission,

18:58.584 --> 19:01.919
inching closer to the
true target of his rage.

19:01.921 --> 19:03.320
Thank you.

19:05.124 --> 19:07.758
Did Alvez say what he wanted us for?

19:07.760 --> 19:10.394
No. Huh.

19:10.396 --> 19:13.263
The same DNA was on the
outside of the water bottle

19:13.265 --> 19:14.932
at Joey Fletcher's crime scene,

19:14.934 --> 19:17.634
but none in the water itself.

19:17.636 --> 19:19.403
So he's not drinking it.

19:19.405 --> 19:20.938
Apparently not.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.473
Then why is he taking
water to the crime scene?

19:23.475 --> 19:25.977
Hey!

19:26.679 --> 19:28.679
In here.

19:28.681 --> 19:30.447
Uh, is everything ok?

19:30.449 --> 19:32.249
You guys ready for a
little show and tell?

19:32.251 --> 19:36.753
I don't know.
Third grade was a long time ago.

19:36.755 --> 19:38.722
Come around, I'll show you.

19:38.724 --> 19:40.657
What's with the crumpled paper?

19:40.659 --> 19:42.492
That is not paper.

19:42.494 --> 19:45.662
And those are boulders
from the crime scene

19:45.664 --> 19:47.164
placed where we found them

19:47.166 --> 19:49.032
and relative to this stick,

19:49.034 --> 19:53.570
which represents the poles
were our victims were tied.

19:53.572 --> 19:54.838
What's you thinking?

19:54.840 --> 19:56.773
I'm thinking we've been over-thinking.

19:56.775 --> 19:59.243
You're out there in the
darkness of the desert,

19:59.245 --> 20:01.411
midnight at the oasis,

20:01.413 --> 20:04.948
but wait, 'cause here comes the sun.

20:04.950 --> 20:07.184
Rise and shine.

20:07.186 --> 20:09.820
Breakfast. Kids are off to school.

20:09.822 --> 20:14.057
And before you know it, it's 1:00.

20:14.059 --> 20:16.293
Don't grab that glass
of chardonnay just yet

20:16.295 --> 20:20.897
because soon it will be 2:00, then 3:00,

20:20.899 --> 20:22.499
then 4:00.

20:22.501 --> 20:23.700
It's a sundial.

20:23.702 --> 20:26.403
Life-size.

20:26.405 --> 20:27.938
With our victims represented

20:27.940 --> 20:29.406
by the coffee stir stick.

20:29.408 --> 20:31.808
And the rocks positioned
to count off the hours.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.010
Yeah.

20:33.012 --> 20:34.411
It might be his way of keeping track

20:34.413 --> 20:36.413
of the body count,
like notches on a belt.

20:36.415 --> 20:38.682
Yeah, but the demonstration
I just gave you

20:38.684 --> 20:39.916
is in reverse.

20:39.918 --> 20:42.753
The first victim is represented by 4:00.

20:42.755 --> 20:45.263
4, 3, 2, 1.

20:47.026 --> 20:49.393
So he's counting down.

20:49.395 --> 20:52.863
The unsub's approaching his end game.

20:55.567 --> 20:56.667
Absolutely.

20:56.669 --> 20:58.001
Very nice to meet you.

20:58.003 --> 20:59.469
Pleasure meeting you.

20:59.471 --> 21:00.671
Thank you so much.

21:00.673 --> 21:03.106
[Indistinct chatter]

21:20.926 --> 21:22.492
[Sighs]

21:22.494 --> 21:24.461
Did they check the
vents in the motel room?

21:24.463 --> 21:26.930
The last time we caught
Scratch, he was dosing people

21:26.932 --> 21:28.699
through the vents, which might be why

21:28.701 --> 21:29.995
I'm remembering in pieces.

21:31.337 --> 21:33.337
Rossi said that was the very first thing

21:33.339 --> 21:36.406
he checked for when they were in Mexico.

21:36.408 --> 21:39.376
Look, we need to start again.

21:40.579 --> 21:41.878
Ok.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.547
Now, this time I want to focus

21:43.549 --> 21:46.750
on Nadie's reaction when the door opens.

21:46.752 --> 21:50.721
Is she frightened?
Does she know the person?

21:51.657 --> 21:53.557
We were both surprised.

21:53.559 --> 21:55.759
It all happened so fast that...

21:55.761 --> 21:57.327
What about you?

21:57.329 --> 21:59.129
Did you recognize him?

22:00.699 --> 22:03.100
[Nadie screams]

22:06.705 --> 22:08.805
Hmm. Mm-mmm. I'm trying,

when you were blocked.

22:18.350 --> 22:20.617
There's nothing I can do.

22:20.619 --> 22:23.053
And what about him? I
mean, you must feel him

22:23.055 --> 22:24.721
in your peripheral vision,

22:24.723 --> 22:26.991
behind you somewhere.

22:27.393 --> 22:29.793
Yeah, he's behind me.

22:29.795 --> 22:31.528
And I can feel him watching me,

22:31.530 --> 22:34.598
and I'm...

22:39.505 --> 22:41.204
What is it?

22:41.206 --> 22:44.541
It was me.

22:45.844 --> 22:47.411
What was you?

22:52.284 --> 22:53.850
It's how I cut my hand,

22:53.852 --> 22:57.888
it's why he was watching me.

22:57.890 --> 22:59.790
'Cause I was stabbing her.

23:03.195 --> 23:04.861
I killed her.

23:25.732 --> 23:27.332
I'm on my way home right now.

Wow, that was fast. How'd it go?

23:29.269 --> 23:30.668
I'm guardedly optimistic.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.871
My person is running it past his person.

23:32.873 --> 23:34.606
What happened with Reid?

23:34.608 --> 23:36.841
We hit a stumbling block.
He wanted to stop.

23:36.843 --> 23:39.344
His brain is constructing
a false narrative

23:39.346 --> 23:40.712
for what happened in Mexico.

23:40.714 --> 23:41.913
That's not uncommon.

23:41.915 --> 23:43.481
Sometimes a manufactured memory

23:43.483 --> 23:45.049
is better than no memory at all.

23:45.051 --> 23:47.552
Oh, I've seen it
countless times in my work.

23:47.554 --> 23:49.554
People see things that weren't there

23:49.556 --> 23:52.090

All right.

23:58.832 --> 24:00.532
I mean, in a bigger sense.

24:00.534 --> 24:02.500
No. No, I don't.

24:02.502 --> 24:05.403
I think that even before
all of this happened,

24:05.405 --> 24:07.071
he was under more stress
than he'd ever been.

24:07.073 --> 24:09.040
And you couple that
with the terrible memory

24:09.042 --> 24:10.441
of what happened in Mexico,

24:10.443 --> 24:12.010
it's just making reconstructing

24:12.012 --> 24:14.012
what happened in that motel
room that much more difficult.

No. No, we can get there.

What can I do to help?

24:20.620 --> 24:23.187
Well, just tell the
prison that the doctor

needs more time with her patient.

24:25.425 --> 24:26.858

up a few things here,

If this is all about
control and obedience,

a regular collar pretty much
does the same thing, you know.

That's when we thought he was

Maybe he empties it into
the sand while they watch.

27:18.431 --> 27:21.299
Joey Fletcher's family didn't have
anywhere near that kind of money.

27:21.301 --> 27:23.701
How did he pay for it?

27:23.703 --> 27:26.971
He didn't. He was there on scholarship.

27:26.973 --> 27:30.508
So was Oscar Benitez.
It was a different college,

27:30.510 --> 27:36.447

Uh, yeah, I'm right there with you.

both Pete and Carol

35:45.117 --> 35:46.783
She wouldn't want this.

35:46.785 --> 35:49.720
What she wants doesn't matter anymore.

35:54.059 --> 35:56.366
Tomorrow this will all be over.

35:57.429 --> 35:58.529
[Gasps]

35:58.531 --> 35:59.997
Ben Davis, FBI.

35:59.999 --> 36:01.698
Hands up. Hands where we can see them.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.467
Hey, hey, hey. Stay where you are.

36:03.469 --> 36:05.402
Ben, don't. Put it down.

36:08.474 --> 36:10.073
JJ: Whoa, stay right there.

36:10.075 --> 36:11.464
Alvez: Ben, don't.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.580
No, listen, you don't want to do this.

36:16.582 --> 36:18.282
Ok?

36:20.920 --> 36:23.820
Look, I'm... I'm putting my gun away.

36:24.924 --> 36:26.590
All right?

36:28.027 --> 36:30.160
Ok, I'm gonna leave.

36:30.162 --> 36:32.196
I'm leaving.

36:37.036 --> 36:39.836
All right. Hey.

36:39.838 --> 36:42.839
It's just us now, ok?

36:42.841 --> 36:45.075
Let's talk.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.911
There's nothing to talk about.

36:49.114 --> 36:51.081
Is that your mother?

36:51.083 --> 36:53.183
Tell me what happened.

36:53.185 --> 36:54.885
I want to help.

36:54.887 --> 36:57.788
It's too late for that.

36:57.790 --> 37:00.357
I always promised I'd...

37:00.359 --> 37:03.768
Take her to Hawaii in the future.

37:03.963 --> 37:05.862
That was her dream.

37:05.864 --> 37:07.965
But now she's dead.

37:07.967 --> 37:10.534
Then make her dream come true.

37:10.536 --> 37:12.269
Take her to Hawaii.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.771
You can spread her
ashes out in the ocean.

37:14.773 --> 37:16.974
That way, she'll be
a part of it forever.

37:20.546 --> 37:24.848
No. You won't do that.

37:24.850 --> 37:28.885
I put this down, you'll
just bury her here somewhere

37:28.887 --> 37:30.254
in the dirt.

37:30.256 --> 37:31.955
I won't.

37:31.957 --> 37:33.557
I give you my word.

37:33.559 --> 37:37.160
No, it's over.

37:39.698 --> 37:41.965
[Grunts]

37:45.237 --> 37:47.504
JJ, we're clear!

37:50.976 --> 37:53.377
[Sobbing]

37:53.379 --> 37:55.812
[Handcuffs clicking]

38:00.386 --> 38:02.853
Prentiss: “The future
is inevitable and precise,

38:02.855 --> 38:04.554
“but may not occur.

38:04.556 --> 38:07.124
God lurks in the gaps.”

38:07.126 --> 38:09.460
Jorge Luis Borges.

38:13.365 --> 38:14.865
You beat us back.

38:14.867 --> 38:16.767
[Chuckles] By an hour.

38:16.769 --> 38:18.935
It was a long way to go
to have one conversation,

38:18.937 --> 38:20.871
but it was worth it.
I just heard from Interpol,

38:20.873 --> 38:21.905
they're on board.

38:21.907 --> 38:22.973
You?

38:22.975 --> 38:25.242
Spoke with my contact at the NSA,

38:25.244 --> 38:27.544
and she says if Reid
can swear under oath

38:27.546 --> 38:29.179
that he saw Scratch in that motel room,

38:29.181 --> 38:32.049
then we are a go putting
him on the terror watch list.

38:32.051 --> 38:33.050
That's great news.

38:33.052 --> 38:34.618
Except none of that means anything

38:34.620 --> 38:36.420
if Reid can't remember what happened.

38:36.422 --> 38:39.990
So let's hope Tara makes progress.

38:41.994 --> 38:44.695
[Door buzzes]

38:44.697 --> 38:47.964
Reid: I cannot do this
anymore, all right?

38:47.966 --> 38:49.766
I told you it was better
if you all just stayed away.

38:49.768 --> 38:51.068
You're making it worse.

38:51.070 --> 38:53.770
No, Spencer. Your brain
is playing tricks on you.

38:53.772 --> 38:55.339
You realize that, don't you?

38:55.341 --> 38:57.307
Why? Why? Because the cognitive

38:57.309 --> 38:58.809
gave you an answer
you'd rather not have?

38:58.811 --> 39:01.511
No, because Spencer Reid
is incapable of murdering

39:01.513 --> 39:03.380
an innocent woman in cold blood.

39:03.382 --> 39:06.983
You have no idea what I am capable of.

39:08.354 --> 39:11.421
Look, prison is a difficult place.

39:11.423 --> 39:13.557
You've probably had to do things in here

39:13.559 --> 39:14.991
to survive that you would never think

39:14.993 --> 39:17.094
of doing in the outside world,

39:17.096 --> 39:19.363
things that make you feel guilty

39:19.365 --> 39:20.997
or ashamed.

39:20.999 --> 39:23.533
But the brain has to handle that guilt,

39:23.535 --> 39:25.302
has to process it.

39:25.304 --> 39:28.505
And sometimes it
spreads the guilt around

39:28.507 --> 39:31.775
into places it doesn't belong.

39:31.777 --> 39:33.744
I could see the knife in my hand.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.346
We know Scratch uses drugs to change

39:36.348 --> 39:39.249
our perception of what's
real and what's not.

39:41.553 --> 39:42.786
What do we do now?

39:42.788 --> 39:44.688
Do you want to go
back in that hotel room

39:44.690 --> 39:45.956
and find out what really happened?

39:45.958 --> 39:48.258
- Yes.
- Then say it.

39:48.260 --> 39:52.662
Not to me. Say it to yourself.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.401
I want to go back.

39:59.972 --> 40:01.538
[Nadie screaming]

40:01.540 --> 40:03.306
Lewis: What's in your right hand?

40:03.308 --> 40:05.308
Reid: Nothing.

40:05.310 --> 40:06.410
Where's the knife?

40:06.412 --> 40:08.345
I moved it so I could get to her,

40:08.347 --> 40:10.614
and that's probably how I cut my hand.

40:10.616 --> 40:11.848
What happens next?

40:11.850 --> 40:14.251
I hear a noise, like a spraying sound.

40:14.253 --> 40:18.221
And I feel a mist over my shoulder,

40:18.223 --> 40:20.624
so I turn.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.859
Do you recognize who it is?

40:22.861 --> 40:23.927
No.

40:23.929 --> 40:26.229
Look hard. Spencer, concentrate.

40:26.231 --> 40:28.899
Let the image come into focus.

40:36.074 --> 40:38.408
It's him. It's him. I see him.

40:38.410 --> 40:40.110
It's Scratch. It's Scratch.

40:40.112 --> 40:42.012
It's Scratch. And he's drugging me.

40:42.014 --> 40:43.213
[Distorted voice]

40:43.215 --> 40:45.315
And I hear him say something.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.583
He says something. He says...

40:46.585 --> 40:48.652
What... what does he say?

40:48.654 --> 40:51.788
Woman: It's time. Time to go.

40:51.790 --> 40:54.424
Time to go. Says, “time to go.”

40:54.426 --> 40:56.092
Time to go, then she
just walked out of there

40:56.094 --> 40:57.227
like she didn't have
a care in the world.

40:57.229 --> 40:58.361
Wait, wait a minute.

40:58.363 --> 40:59.830
Like she wanted me to chase her.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.198
Spencer, stop.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.899
You keep saying “her.”

41:02.901 --> 41:06.069
'Cause it wasn't Scratch who framed me.

41:06.071 --> 41:08.705
It was a woman.
