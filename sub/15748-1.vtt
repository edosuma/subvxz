Mr Selfridge, how was
your trip to Dublin?

Brown Thomas is now a part of the
Selfridge department store group.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.030
~ Will the shop take the Selfridge name?
~ That's the idea.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.430
Is it true you're investing
in aviation now?

02:38.480 --> 02:41.550
What? Where did you get
that information from?

02:41.600 --> 02:45.710
It says you're planning to
buy the land for an aerodrome.

02:45.760 --> 02:50.510
Pure speculation, although aviation
is the future. I'll say that.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.630
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen,
I have a wedding to attend.

father expanding the business?

I'm proud of my father
and everything he does.

Never before in the ten years
this store has been open

03:06.360 --> 03:08.230

~ Of course.

were injured in France.

Entirely healed, thank
you. I was fortunate.

were meeting at the church.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.530
and if there's anything I can do...

16:55.580 --> 16:58.210
Mr Leclair! Mr Leclair!

16:58.260 --> 17:01.010
~ Oh, Mr Crabb.
~ How splendid to see you.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.940
(LAUGHTER)

17:05.060 --> 17:08.010
Oh, what a show you've put on, sir!

17:08.060 --> 17:10.210
It really is very generous of you.

17:10.260 --> 17:13.530
Family means the world to me,
as I'm sure it does to you.

17:13.579 --> 17:17.650
I've just been telling this fellow
about our potential business venture.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.690
The design of my plane
is nearly finished.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.930
I just need to set up a production
line, and then it can fly.

17:23.980 --> 17:25.810
From the Selfridge aerodrome.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.890
~ Where's the aerodrome going to be?
~ Piece of land in Acton.

17:28.940 --> 17:32.810
This isn't a discussion
for now. Where's Rosalie?

17:32.860 --> 17:35.210
Oh, she's around... somewhere.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.260
I'll find her.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.210
It's unlike you to
be drinking, Arthur.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.500
A piece of land in Acton?
Commercial air travel?

17:46.620 --> 17:48.620
Oooh...

17:51.820 --> 17:54.850
There you are. What are you doing?

17:54.900 --> 17:56.900
Taking a moment.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.050
It's all a bit much.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.970
My wedding party, on
top of Pa's world.

18:04.260 --> 18:06.930
If you preferred the party
at home, you should have said.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.970
Pa wanted it here.

18:09.020 --> 18:11.330
You have to stand up
for what you want.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.380
(RAUCOUS LAUGHTER)

18:16.620 --> 18:19.010
Don't let Serge play
you like Pa played Ma.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.660
Oh, spare me the advice, Violette.

18:21.780 --> 18:25.570
You've never been in love with a man.
You've hardly ever been out with one.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.090
It's not as simple as you think.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.810
We're going to do all this.

18:33.860 --> 18:37.780
It might take me a while to get the
money together, but I will. I promise.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.860
I won't let you down.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.130
I don't care about any of this.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.180
Are you sure?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.840
I just want to be your wife.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.440
I've waited long enough.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.280
They've read the banns in the church.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.180
We could get married any time.

18:59.140 --> 19:02.820
Selfridge's was hit by the war, but
it did better than most stores.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.280
Selfridge himself floated
shares in '16.

19:06.860 --> 19:09.970
~ He doesn't own the whole store any more?
~ No.

19:10.020 --> 19:14.450
And his personal finances?
Loans? Debts? Credit?

19:14.500 --> 19:18.930
That's not information I'm privy to.
Why this obsession with Selfridge?

19:18.980 --> 19:21.730
And it wasn't just you disgraced.
I've had a tough time.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.730
I've lost the family estate.
I've had to get a job.

19:24.780 --> 19:28.220
Poor Miles. The first
Edgerton to clock in.

19:29.580 --> 19:32.530
Why don't you just draw
a line under it all?

19:32.580 --> 19:35.130
He took...

19:35.180 --> 19:37.180
what was mine.

19:38.020 --> 19:40.020
Mae?

19:41.660 --> 19:45.780
So... he did cover her legal
fees for the divorce?

19:46.940 --> 19:49.050
Well, that's what people said.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.300
He took her away from me.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.060
I intend to pay him back.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.970
What do you want all this lot for?

20:09.020 --> 20:11.020
Cocktails.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.900
~ Well, what's wrong with beer?
~ I want big money coming in.

20:17.260 --> 20:19.600
I've hired a Dixieland band.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.730
Dixieland?

20:21.780 --> 20:24.490
That's what the party
set like at the moment.

20:24.540 --> 20:27.740
And this band can't half
play a tune, as well!

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
Come and see 'em.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.890
Is it a good idea, then, this band?

20:35.940 --> 20:37.940
If you can afford it.

20:38.380 --> 20:42.450
An article came out yesterday. Apparently,
I'm buying a piece of land in Acton.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.570
The aerodrome? It isn't true?

20:44.620 --> 20:48.700
It's an idea Serge's been throwing
around. Where did the story come from?

20:54.340 --> 20:57.530
~ I was afraid of that.
~ Maybe he didn't mean it.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.170
High spirits. Enthusiasm.

21:00.220 --> 21:03.010
I should have done
some digging on him.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.650
It's all happened very quickly,

21:05.700 --> 21:08.570
~ and Rosalie was very upset about her mother.
~ Mmm.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.090
Have you heard anything else?

21:11.140 --> 21:14.740
He's out and about...
like we were at his age.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.210
Gather round, everyone!

21:18.260 --> 21:20.530
Dobro pozhalovat'.

21:20.580 --> 21:25.490
Speeches and cake. Come on!
Poyekhali! Come on! Come on!

21:25.540 --> 21:28.970
~ Isn't this meant to be YOUR cue?
~ Gather round, everyone.

21:29.020 --> 21:31.020
Poyekhali!

21:32.780 --> 21:36.250
When my mother introduced
me to Rosalie,

21:36.300 --> 21:39.690
I thought she was the most
beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

21:39.740 --> 21:41.730
GUESTS: Ahhh!

21:41.780 --> 21:44.860
And then I discovered who she was.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.010
Selfridge.

21:49.060 --> 21:53.540
The store that presented Bleriot's
aeroplane to the world.

21:54.940 --> 21:59.050
From the day I was born, all I did
was look at the birds in the sky...

21:59.100 --> 22:01.410
~ He doesn't half go on about himself.
~ (CHUCKLES)

22:01.460 --> 22:04.210
Then kites and balloons.

22:04.260 --> 22:07.170
And finally... aeroplanes.

22:07.220 --> 22:11.340
Flying is why Serge fell
in love with Rosalie.

22:12.340 --> 22:16.650
He came to me and said,
'Mother, she is an angel!'

22:16.700 --> 22:18.010
(LAUGHTER)

22:18.060 --> 22:20.210
To Serge and Rosalie.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.290
Serge and Rosalie!

22:22.340 --> 22:24.340
Za zdorovye!

22:28.140 --> 22:30.140
(LAUGHTER)

22:30.540 --> 22:32.540
Mama!

22:36.700 --> 22:40.930
Ten per cent of your month's takings,
and you give it to this policeman?

22:40.980 --> 22:43.730
It means all the coppers
turn a blind eye.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.370
I'm meant to stop serving
alcohol at nine.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.930
Well, can you afford
this new band, then?

22:48.980 --> 22:51.530
Don't need to pay 'em till
the end of the week.

22:51.580 --> 22:54.050
I don't like the sound of that.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.050
In France, we used
to say to each other:

22:57.100 --> 23:00.170
if we survived, we'd take every
opportunity that came our way.

23:00.220 --> 23:03.450
~ It sounds risky.
~ Oh, it's different for you.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
You've got the store.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.540
Your sister.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.970
I came back to nothing.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.820
I've got nothing to lose.

23:19.140 --> 23:21.140
Za zdorovye!

23:22.980 --> 23:24.980
Hmm.

23:29.380 --> 23:32.500
~ Still smoking?
~ Oh, you know me too well. Thank you.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.410
There is something
you could do for me.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.010
Could you spare Agnes
tomorrow at the store?

23:42.060 --> 23:43.970
We've waited four years.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.410
We don't want to wait a minute
longer. We want to get married.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.210
That's wonderful news!
Of course. Congrat-

23:50.260 --> 23:52.780
~ (GIGGLING)
~ Sorry, old boy.

23:53.860 --> 23:57.170
~ Quite a party, huh?
~ Yeah. Quite a party.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.380
GUESTS: Za zdorovye!

24:18.700 --> 24:20.860
Look, Mummy!

24:28.260 --> 24:30.260
This is very exciting.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.210
There's more stock come through for
the Spring Promotion Mr Towler.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.860
Shall we get it up onto the floor?

24:43.540 --> 24:45.540
Mr Towler?

24:53.540 --> 24:55.880
You sort it out, Miss Ellis.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.440
~ Good to see so many customers.
~ Isn't it?

25:01.140 --> 25:02.930
Hopefully, we're back on track.

25:02.980 --> 25:07.980
Mr Crabb and I have been going
through the accounts. The figures
are up a little each month.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.330
Mr Towler, what are
you doing up here?

25:10.380 --> 25:12.050
I need to talk to you.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
Very well.

25:20.740 --> 25:22.530
Good morning, Mr De Bolotoff.

25:22.580 --> 25:25.850
My wife and I are on a train to Venice
this evening. We'll need a taxi.

25:25.900 --> 25:29.380
Very good, sir. And the gentleman
over there wanted to see you.

25:29.780 --> 25:32.730
~ Mr De Bolotoff.
~ Sorry, but do I er...?

25:32.780 --> 25:35.050
Lord Loxley. I'm a financier.

25:35.100 --> 25:39.170
I've spent the last four years in
the States, investing in tobacco.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.210
Every soldier needs a smoke.

25:41.260 --> 25:44.810
~ Yes, but...
~ I'm back in England, and
I read about your venture.

25:44.860 --> 25:48.930
A passenger plane flying from
an aerodrome in West London.

25:48.980 --> 25:51.250
What an inspired young man you are.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.050
Well, it's been harder to get
money for than you'd think.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.850
But it seems like your father-in-law...

25:56.900 --> 26:00.290
He should be in. I just need
to get the ready from him.

26:00.340 --> 26:04.730
Ah. I don't want to step
on Mr Selfridge's toes,

26:04.780 --> 26:09.330
so maybe there are other projects we
can discuss a little more privately.

26:09.380 --> 26:13.010
My club is just round the corner.

26:13.060 --> 26:17.890
That's jolly kind of you,
but I'm waiting for my wife.

26:17.940 --> 26:20.090
Honeymoon morning and all that.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.450
Ah.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.330
What a shame.

26:23.380 --> 26:26.700
I might not be in town when
you get back from honeymoon.

26:29.860 --> 26:34.020
I'm sure she won't mind. I'll...
just write her a note.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.690
So, Miss Towler and Mr Leclair
are marrying this afternoon?

26:40.740 --> 26:42.770
Yes. A private affair.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.730
All very
spur-of-the-moment
and romantic.

26:45.780 --> 26:47.530
Then back to work here?

26:47.580 --> 26:51.280
After a short honeymoon.
I've given them a week off.

26:52.540 --> 26:57.490
I was wondering, Mr Selfridge. The aviation
project - where are we on that?

26:57.540 --> 27:00.050
A Selfridge aerodrome could
be very interesting.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.290
But is now the right moment?

27:02.340 --> 27:04.530
The business has been
expanding rapidly.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.330
We can't stand still. We
have to keep moving forward.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.380
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

27:10.260 --> 27:12.980
Mr Grove to see you. And Mr Gordon.

27:17.860 --> 27:20.650
A floral bouquet, fresh
as spring itself.

27:20.700 --> 27:25.220
A hat for those May days when
you're boating on the river.

27:26.820 --> 27:29.010
Mrs De Bolotoff. Good morning.

27:29.060 --> 27:32.570
I'm still finding it hard to
recognise myself by that name.

27:32.620 --> 27:36.530
By the end of your honeymoon you'll have
forgotten you were called anything else.

27:36.580 --> 27:38.170
Can I help you with something?

27:38.220 --> 27:40.650
I'm actually looking for Chinaware.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.010
May I ask: where will you be living?

27:43.060 --> 27:45.130
Father's rented us a
mews house in Mayfair.

27:45.180 --> 27:48.810
Oh. And Mr De Bolotoff - he
isn't shopping with you today?

27:48.860 --> 27:51.200
It's not his thing - teacups.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.640
Nice to see you, Mrs Edwards.

27:59.820 --> 28:02.690
Did Mr Towler give you a reason
for handing in his notice?

28:02.740 --> 28:07.140
He says he's found it hard to settle
since he got back from France.

28:07.540 --> 28:13.180
My concern is that the men and the women
in the loading bay can't rub along together.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.570
Not without a strong
figure at the helm.

28:16.620 --> 28:19.610
There's been trouble
down there for months.

28:19.660 --> 28:24.210
I say this with a heavy heart, Mr Selfridge,
but I do think we should let the women go.

28:24.260 --> 28:28.410
Cash flow's tight, Chief, and
staff bills are very high.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.450
It does make sense.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.570
Well, if we have to take the women
out of the loading bay, so be it.

28:33.620 --> 28:37.650
But we find places for
them in other departments.

28:37.700 --> 28:41.650
These women are used to manual work,
chief, not dealing with customers.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.490
Then we'll re-train them.

28:43.540 --> 28:45.250
We'll have to pay them even more.

28:45.300 --> 28:48.370
We'll find the money. That's
the last I will say about this.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.420
Mr Grove, go and tell
the women right now.

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
Now, Mr Grove.

29:02.820 --> 29:04.820
Well? What is it?

29:07.420 --> 29:09.210
Nobody wants to let the women go,

29:09.260 --> 29:11.490
but if Mr Grove and Mr
Crabb think it's right -

29:11.540 --> 29:14.410
Your mother started them off, Gordon.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.610
She even designed their uniforms.

29:16.660 --> 29:19.970
I won't consider it. It would
be a betrayal to her memory.

29:20.020 --> 29:22.570
You're right - it's important
we remember her.

29:22.620 --> 29:25.650
But you're not listening to what
Mr Crabb and Mr Grove are saying.

29:25.700 --> 29:29.810
You're distracted, Pa.
All this expansion.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.130
The store really needs you.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.540
The family does too.

29:36.780 --> 29:40.250
It's true. I have been out of London
for a bit, but I'm back now.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.300
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

29:43.260 --> 29:45.970
Miss Rosalie is in the
Palm Court, Mr Selfridge.

29:46.020 --> 29:49.320
She hoped that you might
join her for a coffee.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.900
Rosalie...

29:58.940 --> 30:01.080
Is everything all right?

30:03.020 --> 30:06.900
We were meant to be having breakfast,
and Serge just left this note.

30:08.820 --> 30:11.620
But maybe that's normal.
I don't know.

30:14.420 --> 30:16.420
(TEARFULLY) I miss Ma.

30:17.020 --> 30:19.090
I don't know what to do without her.

30:19.140 --> 30:21.280
Don't worry, sweetheart.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.750
Get hold of my whole
family, Miss Plunkett.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.790
Tell them to come here for a
drink to see off the newlyweds.

30:54.840 --> 30:58.750
And send a message to Mr
De Bolotoff at his hotel.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.940
Very good, Mr Selfridge.

31:06.120 --> 31:08.870
My name's Nancy Webb, and
I need to see Mr Selfridge.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.590
~ Is he expecting you?
~ No, but it's important.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.750
Well, he's busy. You'll have
to come back another time.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.430
Typical. Men like him hide
behind their secretaries.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.880
I'm Harry Selfridge. I
don't hide behind anyone.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.480
Come in.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.950
What can I do for you, Miss Webb?

31:29.000 --> 31:32.560
Please... don't buy this land.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.830
Why not?

31:38.880 --> 31:41.230
There's a housing shortage in London.

31:41.280 --> 31:46.190
Our men coming back from war are living on
the streets because they don't have a home.

31:46.240 --> 31:51.120
Now, that land is the perfect spot
to build subsidised cottages on.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.430
You have your own company?

31:54.480 --> 31:58.080
Yes, I specialise in
social-welfare projects.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.230
I have a degree in social science.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.430
This will give you some idea of what
I'm hoping to use the land for.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.750
The government's Homes
For Heroes campaign?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.430
They'll give me a grant
if I can match it.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.870
Lord Meadows was going to donate...

32:12.920 --> 32:15.310
He gives a lot of money
to charity, doesn't he?

32:15.360 --> 32:19.750
Yes, but he's thinking of pulling
out, because you're going to go
up against him at auction.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.790
I'm sorry, Miss Webb. This
article - it's a rumour.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.950
I've never even seen
this piece of land.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.830
But your son-in-law has.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.790
He told Lord Meadows all about
your plans for the aerodrome.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.230
I don't have any plans. Everyone
seems to have an opinion

32:34.280 --> 32:36.630
on what they think I
should or shouldn't do.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.630
The auction is coming up soon.
It would really help me to know

32:39.680 --> 32:41.710
if you're going to bid for it or not,

32:41.760 --> 32:44.670
because, if you are, I will need
to find another piece of land.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.260
(SIGHS) I will keep you informed.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.990
Thank you. I appreciate it.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.360
My wife built cottages like this for artists
in Chicago before we were married.

32:57.360 --> 33:00.390
She thought home was more
important than anything else.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.440
She was right.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.720
Good afternoon.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.480
(DOOR CLOSES)

33:18.680 --> 33:20.680
She's nearly ready.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.920
You're not wearing black.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.470
Well, I had to come out
of mourning at some point.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.510
This seemed like a good moment.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.600
I was so sorry to hear about Florian.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.260
Everybody lost somebody.

33:39.200 --> 33:42.300
Yes. One man comes back
and another doesn't.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.080
Why me and not him?

33:46.720 --> 33:49.190
Henri, you mustn't feel guilty.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.660
Goodness. You and Agnes
deserve your happiness.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.960
We got Beatrice packed and
back to school. I'll miss her.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.840
What's all this about, anyway?

34:12.520 --> 34:14.429
Oh, what's she doing here?

34:14.480 --> 34:16.989
~ Sweetheart...
~ She was at the house all morning.

34:17.040 --> 34:20.150
Grandma ended up hiding
in the laundry cupboard.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.630
There were pillow cases
that needed folding.

34:22.679 --> 34:25.469
Look at all these presents.
I'll have a martini, please.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.429
With a twist of lemon. (CHUCKLES)

34:27.480 --> 34:29.469
Hair of the dog.

34:29.520 --> 34:31.520
How are you, darling?

34:33.719 --> 34:36.190
Have you been buying
for the new house?

34:36.239 --> 34:39.550
The house is exactly what I
wanted to speak to you about.

34:39.600 --> 34:45.350
I don't think that now is the best time for
Rosalie and Serge to set up a new home.

34:45.400 --> 34:50.670
I think it's important, as families,
for us to get to know each other.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.590
The De Bolotoffs and the Selfridges.

34:53.639 --> 34:57.870
I want Rosalie and Serge to come
and live at Arlington Street.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.510
Pa, you could have asked us.

34:59.560 --> 35:04.230
It'll mean you don't have to concern yourself
with servants or menus. You hate all that.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.990
But my mother was going
to come and live with us.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.830
She was?

35:08.880 --> 35:11.230
Just while you were getting
used to married life.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.910
But you weren't going to
stay with them indefinitely?

35:13.960 --> 35:15.990
You have somewhere else
to live, don't you?

35:16.040 --> 35:18.910
Of course. I'll go
back to Eaton Square.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.430
I have a divine little flat there.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.950
~ Mother, are you sure?
~ Absolutely, darling.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Don't worry about me.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.430
And while you both are
under the same roof,

35:29.480 --> 35:32.150
you can forge ahead with
the aerodrome plans.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.400
Ah, yes. We need to talk
about the aerodrome.

35:38.040 --> 35:41.270
I give you this ring as
a sign of our marriage.

35:41.320 --> 35:46.160
With my body I honour you.
All that I am I give to you.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.470
Do you, Agnes Mary Towler,

35:56.520 --> 35:59.720
take Henri Olivier Leclair
to be your husband?

36:00.230 --> 36:01.230
I do.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.390
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.550
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

36:05.600 --> 36:08.030
~ For better, for worse.
~ For better, for worse.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.830
~ For richer, for poorer.
~ For richer, for poorer.

36:10.880 --> 36:14.800
~ In sickness and in health.
~ In sickness and in health.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.510
God the father. God the son. God the
Holy Ghost. Bless and preserve...

36:20.560 --> 36:23.430
That time when I came
to visit you on leave -

36:23.480 --> 36:25.820
I wanted to get married then.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.060
I didn't want to tempt fate.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.750
Anyway, you've got me for ever now.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.040
What is that?

36:37.960 --> 36:39.990
Oh, it's our honeymoon destination.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.990
(LAUGHS) Where are we going?

36:42.040 --> 36:44.230
Well, it's a surprise.

36:44.280 --> 36:47.080
No! It's a surprise.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.150
No. We can't - not here.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.600
Why not? There's no-one about.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.070
Get the aeroplane built first and
then we'll consider an aerodrome.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.750
But can you help with the production
line? Building an aeroplane isn't cheap.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.470
I never said that I would
finance it. You presumed...

37:17.520 --> 37:20.270
That is not true. You told
me we'd work together.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.310
In a general way. Not on
this specific project...

37:23.360 --> 37:25.230
I have other possible investors.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.030
Well, you should go with them.
I don't like to be rushed.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.080
I will.

37:30.280 --> 37:34.870
If you don't want to keep it in the family.
I'm sure Rosalie would be pleased -

37:34.920 --> 37:37.630
Don't use my daughter as leverage.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.470
Do you understand me?

37:39.520 --> 37:42.520
You behave with her,
or I'll give you hell.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.870
Hmm.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.120
(I'd like to see you try.)

38:00.400 --> 38:02.400
(JAZZ)

38:13.120 --> 38:15.390
The band... is catching on.

38:15.840 --> 38:18.550
~ I need to talk to Victor.
~ He's in his office.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.600
George, he's busy...

38:31.120 --> 38:33.460
You're doing well out there.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.030
I want more.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.230
Well, you can't have
it. I haven't got it.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.800
Then you have to be forgiving about
what comes inside this club.

38:45.120 --> 38:48.470
~ Some I know would like to run
their business through here.
~ No.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.520
I've said this before.

38:51.360 --> 38:54.030
Well, it's that or it's more money!

38:54.120 --> 38:57.030
Here. Take it.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.080
~ George...
~ Take it.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.710
That's the rate for next month.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.100
Nice doing business with you.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.350
What are you doing?

39:20.400 --> 39:23.430
What does it look like? I'm
getting you out of a spot.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.950
And what are you dressed up for?

39:26.320 --> 39:28.320
Henri's come back.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.180
Agnes married him this afternoon.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.270
Where did you get the money from?

39:39.320 --> 39:42.400
Miss Mardle won't let me
pay rent. I've saved it.

39:43.560 --> 39:47.030
I want to come in with you. We
always said 'every opportunity'.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.350
No, George, listen. Not
here, not at the club.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.510
You said it before - it's too risky.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.430
~ Well, I'm out of work, then.
~ What?

39:55.480 --> 39:57.310
I've handed in my notice.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.880
You need someone to watch your
back. I'm coming to work for you.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.480
(SIGHS)

40:10.400 --> 40:13.430
I telegrammed through to
reserve your best suite.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.310
Princess Marie Vyazemsky.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.230
Ah, yes.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.150
It wasn't clear, Princess.
How long will you be staying?

40:20.200 --> 40:23.310
~ Indefinitely.
~ And the bill?

40:23.360 --> 40:26.030
Charge it to the Selfridge account.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.110
Oh, thank goodness you're
back. A fuse has blown.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.390
I've been trying to mend it,
but I'm not good at that sort
of thing. Henri, would you...?

40:36.440 --> 40:40.160
~ Of course.
~ Thank you. The fuse is just
through there in the kitchen.

40:41.920 --> 40:45.760

Henri?

41:40.200 --> 41:42.200
(PANTING)

41:47.880 --> 41:50.480
~ Are you all right?
~ Yes, I'm fine.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.470
NANCY: 'Men returning from
war are living on the streets

42:52.520 --> 42:55.270
because they don't have
a roof over their heads.

42:55.320 --> 42:59.640
Now, this land is the perfect spot
to build subsidised cottages on.'

43:54.520 --> 43:57.790
These are houses that my
late wife built for charity.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.710
This isn't our area of expertise.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.430
Head down and weather the storm.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.270
Young men like you are the future.

44:03.320 --> 44:06.350
Madame Lanvin designed these
dresses for Selfridge's.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.310
She expects massive press exposure.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.950
~ You should've seen him. I'm so worried.
~ He's had enough.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.590
I'm not one of your 'yes' men!

44:12.640 --> 44:14.510
Am I a 'yes' man, Mildred?

44:14.560 --> 44:16.190
You can't stay clean for ever.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.710
It's not about that. It's
about staying in charge.

44:18.760 --> 44:20.590
~ Mr Crabb?
~ I have something to say.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.390
~ Loxley?
~ You know him?
~ Stay away from him.

44:23.440 --> 44:26.080
I'm going to help him
dig his own grave.
